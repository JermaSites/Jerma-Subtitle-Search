[00:02.11]Listen to that sound, listen to that sound, listen to this sound!
[00:04.30]There it is.
[00:08.72]It should.
[00:09.20]Okay.
[00:10.60]PS2 Slim.
[00:11.34]Okay, yeah, let's do it.
[00:15.50]So this was a guitar stream that had a coliseum in the middle.
[00:23.39]Let's do this.
[00:23.81]This is gonna be called Strummin' Along.
[00:30.22]Um, Jammer, Lambie.
[00:34.05]Did it work?
[00:35.17]Let's make sure it works first.
[00:42.51]Reading disk.
[00:42.99]Is it going to work?
[00:46.24]PlayStation.
[00:46.84]Alright!
[00:50.86]Strumming along.
[00:51.52]Um, Jammer, Lambie.
[00:52.26]Let's do it.
[00:57.70]Does it work?
[00:59.49]Come on, work.
[01:02.90]I don't have a PS1 memory card in here.
[01:04.88]Does that matter?
[01:05.34]I mean, this game's only like an hour and a half long, isn't it?
[01:13.82]Like, I'm... It's not like it's gonna be a problem.
[01:16.40]I'm gonna beat it now.
[01:36.29]This is made by the Parappa the Rapper design studio team.
[01:42.08]He's gonna cry about this.
[01:45.54]No, I will not.
[01:49.57]That sure was fun.
[01:51.45]Part one was good too, but this one had more juice.
[01:56.60]Wait, was that Beaker?
[01:58.82]What's wrong, Lammy?
[02:00.06]You seem down.
[02:01.66]Oh, I wish I was that strong.
[02:05.24]Lammy, you're already strong as is.
[02:08.09]You should be more confident.
[02:09.99]Nobody beats Lammy when she's on the guitar.
[02:13.37]Guitar stream.
[02:15.67]But that is the truth.
[02:18.08]Hey, don't forget, we are milk kin.
[02:21.47]With my son's beats, Lambie's guitar, and my almighty bass combined with that distinguished voice, there's nothing to be afraid of.
[02:30.35]Squirrel!
[02:32.29]Yeah!
[02:33.65]Well, well, what do we have here?
[02:36.81]Plenty of munchies for everyone, right?
[02:38.67]Hey, that's ours.
[02:40.08]That's our food.
[02:41.18]Not only munchies, but a little babe, all dressed up for us.
[02:45.98]Ain't that right?
[02:51.23]See?
[02:51.73]The guitar rules again!
[03:19.40]I take it like a stage select to make sure a load and save replayed method is replaying this high score options Check it out Turn off the vibration subtitles.
[03:44.43]What's what happened to this?
[03:45.37]Oh
[03:48.31]Oh, okay, first I'm like, wait, why is, how do you get bites in the middle?
[03:54.37]Level normal.
[03:57.95]Okay.
[04:00.97]Alright, let's do it.
[04:04.75]New game.
[04:06.41]It's not easy.
[04:09.45]Easy?
[04:11.01]What are you talking about?
[04:15.17]The bite was on the normal.
[04:19.49]Well, what should I tell them?
[04:22.23]I had a stomach ache, so I went to the bathroom.
[04:27.35]But there was a long line at the gas station.
[04:30.78]I told them it was an emergency.
[04:35.28]But they said, let's rap for it.
[04:38.36]Nah.
[04:46.55]Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[04:48.71]Good.
[04:50.09]Does this go?
[04:52.58]Does it do that?
[05:13.88]Oh, this is like the third game.
[05:15.34]I forgot to tell you this.
[05:17.50]This is Parappa the Rapper comes up, Parappa the Rapper 2, and then I'm Jammerland.
[05:20.50]So just in case you want to know.
[05:22.38]You're supposed to know who this is.
[05:26.22]Let's go!
[05:27.78]Don't retire now.
[05:45.48]Oh, it's up top, it's up top.
[06:01.60]And watch this.
[06:33.08]Shut up!
[06:54.35]You can never get cool on easy.
[06:56.59]What are you talking about?
[06:57.99]Is L like an L?
[06:58.71]Which L?
[06:59.07]There's two Ls!
[06:59.65]There's two Ls!
[07:20.35]When you see L, I don't know if it was left on the D-pad or L. I don't know.
[07:26.31]What is it?
[07:52.98]What?
[07:53.10]It was a vacuum cleaner the whole time?
[07:54.53]What the?
[07:55.17]What?
[07:55.89]Everybody, wait.
[07:58.35]What should I do?
[07:59.97]What are you afraid of?
[08:01.77]Yeah, L2 didn't exist.
[08:02.97]Well, look at my guitar.
[08:05.21]Guitar?
[08:06.78]Listen.
[08:08.32]I lost my dojo.
[08:09.76]I think it's a bad ending.
[08:11.36]But the dojo remains in my mind.
[08:14.86]It even has a casino.
[08:17.30]Dojo, casino.
[08:18.49]That's all in the mind.
[08:20.33]You have nothing to lose.
[08:28.23]Wait, L2 and R2 did exist, did they?
[08:36.59]Back in PlayStation 1?
[08:38.96]I don't remember them existing.
[08:41.64]They did?
[08:43.44]Was there L1?
[08:44.82]I have a PlayStation 1 controller literally behind me.
[08:46.88]Let me check.
[08:47.34]Why don't I just plug that in?
[08:59.31]Wait, I've had this, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[09:01.73]Could I have used this for Guitar-O-Man?
[09:05.58]No, I couldn't have, right?
[09:06.62]It's not the same.
[09:09.48]No, it's not the same input.
[09:10.18]Hold on a second.
[09:28.34]No, it's not, is it?
[09:37.94]No, it's not.
[09:38.60]It's not, is it?
[09:39.74]It is.
[09:40.54]Oh my fucking god.
[09:44.29]This is an official PlayStation 1 controller.
[09:46.17]I have an official PlayStation 1 controller in my hand right now.
[09:56.70]This one doesn't have analog sticks, this one does.
[09:59.79]They feel great.
[10:09.09]I had one right behind me.
[10:15.25]I'm so infuriated.
[10:18.45]I'm going back to Guitar Man after this.
[10:19.95]What happened to the role-game?
[10:24.71]It's alright.
[10:29.76]This thing feels so much better.
[10:33.88]Why do I fucking even have this?
[10:36.23]Whoa, whoa.
[10:36.93]Watch out for the electricity and the water.
[11:03.84]What the fuck is going on here?
[11:06.04]The pizza store downstairs has the crispy one with cheese.
[11:13.06]And it's smelling good, sir.
[11:14.79]I'm going to block all the roads.
[11:16.69]What is going on?
[11:18.19]Please let me through.
[11:19.99]I'm in a hurry.
[11:23.55]A hurry?
[11:25.39]Back off.
[11:25.83]You're in the way.
[11:27.39]What?
[11:27.59]My baby!
[11:28.05]Are you preventing us from... Somebody do something!
[11:32.13]Casino!
[11:32.99]Is this a random person?
[11:34.63]Let's go.
[12:04.72]Everyone's going crazy.
[12:37.88]Gotta give it double sometimes.
[13:50.11]Oh, that was a little bit of... That was freestyle.
[13:52.19]Freestyle.
[13:52.68]Here it goes.
[14:19.02]Freestyle!
[15:08.25]You guys throwing freestyles don't you guys come on High score
[15:43.48]second I put a fucking real controller in my hands.
[15:45.29]Come on.
[15:45.99]Do the math.
[15:47.15]Oh, I want that pizza.
[15:50.29]Flanger?
[15:50.91]Flanger?
[16:14.64]Eleven more minutes to g-g-rule.
[16:18.05]What?
[16:18.65]Why is this happening?
[16:32.48]Wait, hold on.
[16:33.38]Hold on a sec.
[16:34.24]What?
[16:34.52]What is going on?
[16:35.50]I don't remember this.
[16:37.06]She's pregnant?
[16:38.16]I don't- what?
[16:38.92]What?
[16:39.10]No.
[17:02.77]Get away from me!
[17:03.75]What the fuck is going on?! !
[17:30.23]Okay, everyone.
[17:33.50]I'm proud of all of you.
[17:35.50]All the babies are healthy and well.
[17:40.15]Is this what it sounds like?
[17:41.43]I feel like I make this noise.
[17:43.05]I feel like I do this when I talk sometimes.
[17:44.97]Is this what it sounds like?
[17:46.43]You didn't really have a baby, did you?
[17:48.25]Well, get up now and...
[17:59.43]Stop!
[17:59.87]Oh my god!
[18:00.47]Stop!
[18:06.59]Disk scratch!
[18:29.69]what happened I'm so confused Jesus I think that I think something's wrong with the disk
[18:55.75]I can't laugh.
[18:56.31]I'm trying not to laugh that hard because I'm having, like, issues.
[19:00.67]And that was really difficult to not.
[19:05.41]The disk is no longer spinning.
[19:09.97]The disk is clean.
[19:10.89]What's fucking going on?
[19:17.75]Go back to the Rome game.
[19:28.85]Does this thing have damage?
[19:31.33]No, there's no damage on here.
[19:33.49]I'm just trying to buff it out.
[19:38.05]It might pick up right where it left off.
[19:47.80]And I didn't have a save either.
[19:50.16]Shit.
[19:52.02]No, I want to play this.
[19:54.52]Come on.
[19:57.17]No!
[19:58.21]No!
[20:00.19]Why?
[20:10.37]Yeah, I have to restart it.
[20:12.35]It's alright, I can get through those first.
[20:13.52]I wanna play this, this is fun.
[20:20.76]The PS2 is bricked.
[20:21.90]No, it's not.
[20:23.38]Wait, can I go into the browser?
[20:24.51]Hold on.
[20:25.07]Maybe it's something to do with the speed?
[20:27.73]Hold on a second.
[20:32.67]Can't you do something in the config file?
[20:35.53]And make it so it spins the PS... It does something better?
[20:39.71]It works harder or something?
[20:43.37]I want to see.
[20:46.79]Is it in here?
[20:51.49]No, no, not the... What am I doing?
[20:57.31]No, it's not here.
[21:02.14]No, never mind.
[21:02.74]Alright, let's try it again.
[21:06.86]Wait, come back.
[21:10.74]Oh, man.
[21:14.10]That seriously hurt my... Yeah, it's not here.
[21:16.21]I think it's just on automatically.
[21:18.43]Okay.
[21:21.29]Well, I have nothing really to say about what just happened.
[21:24.26]That was... That was fucking bizarre.
[21:32.38]Is this even going to read the disk now?
[21:35.56]Okay.
[21:43.65]So we're going to skip that cutscene when we get there.
[21:45.25]First of all, I'm going to destroy the first two levels.
[21:47.09]You'll see.
[21:54.58]Uh, thank you, Modest Narcissist.
[21:58.52]Modest Narcissist.
[22:00.30]For the 10,000 subs.
[22:01.40]Appreciate it.
[22:01.94]Thank you.
[22:04.32]But, in the event that that happens again... Wait one sec.
[22:10.55]I'm getting the memory card.
[22:12.67]I don't have it.
[22:24.96]Uh, I don't have it.
[22:26.56]I don't have it.
[22:27.84]So, uh, tough shit.
[22:29.44]Oh, wait, there's like another one.
[22:31.16]I have to go.
[22:33.30]I'm gonna skip through the cutscenes.
[22:35.42]Let's go.
[22:35.82]Turn on the lights.
[22:57.04]Let's see if I can get cool on this one.
[22:58.50]I'm gonna freeze out.
[23:02.55]Isn't there a level select?
[23:04.11]There is, but do you have to unlock them first?
[23:08.27]Hold on.
[23:15.88]It's on normal.
[23:16.58]What are you guys on about?
[23:17.90]Stage... Look.
[23:19.38]Do I really have to go back here and show you?
[23:20.74]I don't have to do this again, do I?
[23:23.80]It's on normal.
[23:24.65]Look!
[23:26.35]Vibration off.
[23:27.51]Subtitles on.
[23:28.23]Norble!
[23:30.37]Stage select.
[23:32.11]Yeah, I can't.
[23:32.75]Alright, let's go.
[23:37.39]Alright, skip the cutscenes so they don't break.
[23:51.31]Using memory card.
[23:52.71]Um, I don't I have no idea where that is The last time I did an actual PlayStation 1 stream It was like a year and a half ago.

[27:02.02]Phew.
[27:04.10]It was a dream.
[27:05.29]There's only 15 more minutes until the show.

[35:09.99]I- Hey.
[35:28.74]There's a 3,000 IQ play here, guys.
[35:34.24]There's a 3,000 IQ play here.
[35:39.82]I did that because I wanted to get rid of the opportunity for it to crash during the actual game.
[35:46.89]What?
[35:47.61]Only 3,000 IQ?
[35:48.93]That's pretty good.
[35:57.39]For a god.
[35:58.85]For a being that is just... Just stepping over every single human bound.
[36:04.65]You know what I mean?
[36:05.59]Like, I'm boundless in my brain.
[36:07.07]Alright, it's saved.
[36:18.74]Alright.
[36:22.32]I'm going to skip this.
[36:25.26]Don't skip the cutscene for this one.
[36:26.90]What?
[36:28.54]I have to.
[36:29.04]What if it breaks?
[36:30.64]It's gonna get stuck again.
[36:31.50]It's gonna get stuck again.
[36:32.98]11 more minutes to go.
[37:02.31]Skip it, please.
[37:03.21]I can't- See!
[37:03.89]I told you!
[37:04.47]I opened the tray on purpose.
[37:07.39]Because I wanted to be right.
[37:44.00]What?
[37:44.18]Oh, a bird!
[37:45.56]What?
[37:46.38]It's in the room!
[37:46.90]Alright, that was fucking not even funny.
[37:49.93]Why did I do that?
[37:56.91]Now I am gonna skip it.
[38:04.73]It's the dry laugh he does.
[38:07.45]Every stream.
[38:08.45]No, I don't do that every stream.
[38:15.89]I wonder if we can get through this, are we?
[38:18.79]You're stuck here.
[38:19.95]And I'm Jammer Lammy.
[38:35.42]Alright.
[38:36.48]We'll watch the whole thing.
[38:37.38]I'm going to close my eyes and block my ears.
[38:40.78]Tell me when it's over.
[38:44.35]What?
[38:49.22]No, why do they all do this?
[38:50.66]I tried to go down to the menu.
[38:53.52]Oh my god.
[38:54.62]I had down to go to menu, but it was on menu already.
[39:07.22]What?
[39:20.83]Oh, load.
[39:21.33]Okay.
[39:23.77]Load game.
[39:26.73]Load.
[39:28.14]Alright.
[39:28.64]Apparently it's been loaded.

[39:32.02]Level three.
[39:34.24]Let's go.
[39:40.74]Enjoy This too
[39:57.71]Guys, if I don't skip it, half of everybody in here is going to be very upset with me.
[40:05.86]If I do skip it, half of everybody's going to be very upset with me.
[40:14.66]It's a double, it's just two edges to the sword.
[40:19.14]No matter what happens, I'm always gonna get, like, cut by the blade.
[40:40.97]I scored a +2 and -2.
[40:43.74]Skip the whole game.
[40:44.54]Why would I do that?
[40:45.44]I purchased it specifically.
[40:47.36]Ugh, I hate this part.
[41:05.78]I hate this.
[41:08.73]Yeah, I like skipping.
[41:11.79]Alright, it's not skipping.
[41:14.79]Okay, it's not skipping.
[41:20.01]Okay, everyone.
[41:23.23]I'm proud of all of you.
[41:25.29]All the babies are healthy and well.
[41:29.86]You're still not done?
[41:31.62]But your tummy is small now.
[41:35.64]Hey, you didn't really have a baby, did you?
[41:40.22]No!
[41:42.08]No!
[41:43.55]No!
[41:47.07]Skip it quick!
[41:47.75]Why?
[41:48.47]Ugh!
[41:48.87]Alright, I'm gonna... I'm washing the disk.
[42:06.72]There's nothing, there's no scratches on this disk.
[42:09.34]How do you... How do I wash something?
[42:14.20]How do you wash this?
[42:18.04]Toothpaste.
[42:19.50]Alright, we're gonna toothpaste it.
[42:20.58]Right?
[42:20.76]Is that how you do it?
[42:21.40]Sorry, I gotta put like a shirt on.
[42:25.30]Because I need to do this one.
[42:26.26]I'll do... No, don't.
[42:27.48]That's not how you do it.
[42:29.93]Wipe it with a cloth.
[42:34.79]Alright, hold on.
[42:35.35]I'll be right back.
[42:40.85]Oh my god.
[42:41.69]Is the stream still on?
[42:50.47]What the fuck is going on?
[42:52.15]Stop.
[42:53.55]Why do I have this other controller here?
[42:56.61]I have this other PlayStation 2 controller that's on my lap.
[42:59.23]It's been on my lap the whole time.
[43:02.44]Okay.
[43:03.32]We're good.
[45:31.65]Alright, if this don't work, I don't know what will.
[45:36.43]I did peanut butter.
[45:38.37]You know, if you get gum in your hair, you do peanut butter.
[45:41.29]So let's see if it works.
[45:55.10]Well, I had to do that because I don't have toothpaste.
[45:57.70]I don't brush my teeth with toothpaste.
[46:01.28]I don't even have a toothbrush.
[46:02.86]So.
[46:08.41]I have a teething stick.
[46:10.55]You know, like your dog chews on, like, bone?
[46:12.67]I just chew on, like, a teething bone.
[46:15.67]And then I hold my mouth open in the shower, just like this, to let my teeth out, and just have it spray my fucking face really hard.
[46:25.30]I just, like, I chew on a bone.
[46:41.32]Alright, here we go.
[46:45.64]Which one is it on?
[46:47.34]Why have I done this?
[46:48.82]Does red mean highlighted?
[46:50.70]Or does green mean highlighted?
[46:53.06]I've already fucked it up.
[46:54.24]Green is highlighted, right?
[46:57.15]Red is highlighted.
[47:00.13]Okay.
[47:05.45]I'm skipping that cutscene.
[47:06.47]We're not even gonna give it a second.
[47:12.25]Here we go.
[47:12.59]Don't even give it a second.
[47:16.39]What do you mean don't skip?
[47:19.36]I'm skipping it.
[47:21.58]Done.
[47:28.20]Ugh.
[47:30.72]Goddamn broken ass disk.
[47:34.01]I'm getting a PlayStation 1.
[47:37.85]Stay right there.
[47:38.29]Don't look.
[47:47.40]What does it have for power?
[47:49.26]Oh, I don't even know what that is.
[47:50.40]I have no idea what the power is for this thing.
[48:00.89]I have no idea.
[48:02.31]It's a yellow plug.
[48:04.75]I don't even know what that looks like.
[48:09.99]No, I want to continue playing it.
[48:11.91]I want to play this.
[48:13.29]Where is it?
[48:14.07]Come on, it's somewhere in here.
[48:17.05]I just cleaned up, too.
[48:19.92]No.
[48:21.30]Oh, no.
[48:23.74]I just cleaned it all up, too, and it's not.
[48:25.56]I don't know where it is.
[48:28.95]Wait a minute.
[48:29.41]Is it this one?
[48:31.61]What is this?
[48:33.07]No.
[48:33.75]That's Nintendo Switch.
[48:36.38]Damn it.
[48:50.28]What the fuck was that?
[48:51.86]Was it the PS2?
[48:55.86]Do it on an emulator?
[48:56.88]I mean, I gotta go get an emulator.
[49:01.74]I gotta get it.
[49:02.22]I have to go get it and set up a PlayStation 1 emulator?
[49:07.50]Found it.
[49:09.02]Found it, found it, found it, found it, found it, found it.
[49:10.87]I got it.
[49:11.95]Hold on.
[49:16.07]Alright, give me a minute.
[49:17.94]This is going to be kind of fucked up, but let's go for it.
[49:21.05]Let me see if I can do this.
[49:23.91]Hold on.
[49:24.21]Stay right there.
[49:25.36]I'll be right back.
[50:27.83]That was pretty damn quick.
[50:29.65]That was pretty damn quick.
[50:33.05]Let's see if it worked.
[50:33.73]Can you see?
[50:39.24]That was pretty damn quick.
[50:41.50]Here we go.
[50:51.06]Wait a... Alright, let's...
[50:58.91]Let's go.
[50:59.49]Ah, blue.
[51:01.61]Don't skip.
[51:02.41]Guys, I just hooked up an entire new console in like 41 seconds.
[51:13.08]That has to be some kind of record.
[51:15.32]Has to be.
[51:21.77]Don't skip.
[51:29.09]Alright, here we go.
[51:41.31]Shit.
[51:44.91]Wait, it's already loaded.
[51:45.65]Right, okay.
[51:46.15]Here we go.
[51:48.63]Looks sharper, too.
[51:49.51]It's because it's playing on original hardware.
[51:54.49]I'm skipping it.
[51:56.76]Thanks to you, we get to keep our job!
[51:59.94]Let's go!
[52:32.95]I'm killing it right now.
[52:34.72]I fucked it up, I got confused.
[53:10.29]Diaper check, what's in there?
[53:48.35]How is that wrong?
[53:51.05]Fuck.
[54:16.71]The pit rate's going down?
[54:17.85]Oh, shit.
[54:20.29]Now, put those... And then she fucking pukes.
[54:26.30]I hate this thing.
[54:30.28]Ah, it's your... I guess we have to be curious.
[54:52.00]I want to do that one again.
[55:03.55]Listen.
[55:04.03]We have discounts every Monday and Wednesday.
[55:09.43]Come to us when you really have a baby.
[55:11.37]Here.
[55:12.47]Thank you.
[55:15.25]He's got a little...
[55:23.70]I only have eight more minutes.
[55:27.82]Hates his viewers.
[55:29.04]What are you talking about?
[55:36.31]Hey, where are you going?
[55:38.87]No, the plane's leaving.
[55:43.91]Let's see now.
[55:45.33]Was it the green button or the blue switch?
[55:53.66]that back in there?
[55:56.74]Where in the world were you, soldier?
[55:58.66]Haven't you ever heard the term punctual?
[56:01.98]In the Air Force, a split-second decision makes the difference between life and death.
[56:07.26]Don't you know?
[56:10.77]Here we go.
[56:11.59]Uh, I kind of forgot how to fly.
[56:16.79]Is it the best song?
[56:18.51]See, I had to go repair my dentures a few days ago.
[56:25.99]Oh, boy.
[56:27.81]I can eat almonds.
[56:31.30]Fell down again.
[56:33.62]Look, I told you we don't have all day.
[56:36.20]Get to work now, soldier.
[56:38.50]I'm not exactly a pilot, but...
[56:44.48]This guy, another one of those.
[56:47.08]I'll help you fly.
[56:49.20]Now, which one is my right hand?
[56:52.21]May I have your attention, please?
[56:54.33]We will be taking off shortly, so please fasten your seatbelts at this time.
[56:58.97]That also goes for the passengers in our casino.
[57:02.15]Casino?
[57:02.75]Yeah, that's right.
[57:04.03]My guitar's in my mouth.
[57:13.68]This song is a good song.
[57:15.04]I'm looking forward to it.
[57:17.20]Let's go.
[57:17.60]Now, which one is my left hand?
[57:19.90]Could it be this one?
[57:27.55]It's a casino airplane.
[57:48.49]Come on, you can do it, PS1.
[57:51.13]It's supposed to be- It's supposed to be in there, come on!
[57:55.58]Nooo... Now, quick, put it back in the PS2.
[57:58.14]Oh, shh... Fucking goddammit.
[58:00.16]Did I save it before this one?
[58:30.18]Come on!
[58:31.28]I have to... Hold on, give me one second.
[58:34.04]Let's see if it works.
[58:35.22]PS1 for cutscenes and PS2 for when you load again.
[58:38.88]Give me one second.
[59:16.14]Okay, let's plug the power in.
[59:19.38]Which one is the cord?
[59:20.12]Which is the right cord?
[59:21.42]Which is the correct cord?
[59:22.56]I don't remember, it's this one.
[59:24.50]Alright, back to the PS2.
[59:32.34]Okay, let's go.
[59:50.52]Alright, gonna plug that in.
[59:51.26]Need the memory card, the controller, and let's go.
[60:18.38]I had a save point right there.
[60:21.25]So I'm just going to skip that cutscene and see what happens.
[60:27.05]Just emulate it.
[60:29.34]Now it would take like 30 minutes for me to set up an emulator.
[60:32.04]It takes me 25 seconds to switch consoles.
[60:51.62]Alright, that's it.
[60:53.24]Here we go.
[60:55.26]Stage left.
[60:56.16]Stage four.
[60:56.76]Skip.
[60:57.10]Okay, jump.
[61:19.99]Wait, you're rocking?
[61:20.87]Alright, cool.
[61:23.72]Oh, fuck.
[61:50.83]Never give it up soldier
[62:19.17]Fuck that up.
[62:20.23]Uh-oh.
[62:23.91]Uh-oh.
[62:24.27]Shit.
[62:45.95]GET OUTTA HERE!
[63:50.30]And then I run out of oxygen.
[63:54.60]Kind of killed that one.
[63:57.82]Save it.
[64:30.51]That sounded absolutely awful.
[64:32.63]Whoa.
[64:33.07]That was some adventure, eh?
[65:00.71]I think we got over all the problems.
[65:06.41]All the problems are gone, I think.
[65:30.28]It was the middle of the game.
[65:32.08]Oh no!
[65:33.32]I left it on the plane!
[65:38.35]I gotta get me a guitar.
[65:42.09]Hey, there's one!
[65:46.24]May I help you?
[65:47.34]Yeah, um, I'm looking for a guitar.
[65:50.80]What kind?
[65:51.76]Well, um, a cool one with awesome sound and has reclining seats, power steering, and dual airbags.
[65:58.37]I don't have time for jokers!
[66:00.69]Oh, no, no, I'm sorry.
[66:03.13]I just want one that's cool and cheap, and of course, the sound quality's gotta be superior.
[66:07.88]Hmm, a greedy girl, ain't ya?
[66:10.56]Oh, please!
[66:12.20]I'll do anything, anything, please!
[66:15.32]Anything?
[66:16.38]Casino here, casino there, casino!
[66:21.05]What?
[66:22.03]Help!
[66:23.33]Go away!
[66:25.69]You said anything, didn't you?
[66:27.17]You're going to kill me with a chainsaw.
[66:31.73]Uh, don't touch the top of that thing.
[66:35.30]Get your hands away from the top of that or it's not gonna be good.
[67:07.14]Go!
[67:08.02]What the fuck?
[67:09.10]Oh shit!
[67:10.24]What happened?
[67:42.92]come on bring it back
[68:08.59]Yeah!

[68:23.50]I'm givin' it all you got!
[68:26.63]Come on, girl!
[68:35.24]Next to berries or cherries or cotton candy.
[68:38.52]Yeah!
[68:38.92]Take it all you can, every little muscle that you got inside your little papa.
[68:43.88]Hey!
[68:48.56]How's it bad?
[68:49.60]I didn't cry.
[68:50.20]I didn't, I just didn't, I just typed the things in perfectly.
[68:52.13]All I wanna do is keep coming here.
[68:59.83]There's no turning around here.
[69:06.70]We're almost done!
[69:09.88]Ah...
[69:37.46]What?
[69:38.96]Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[69:41.22]It's drying.
[70:12.40]We're almost done with the song.
[70:13.18]We're almost done with the song.
[70:20.04]It's like this last line here.
[70:21.32]Look it, it's done.
[70:27.38]Come on.
[70:31.54]Come on, do it!
[70:33.50]It's right there, just grab the guitar and be done.
[70:43.02]It's right there.
[70:51.15]It's right here.
[70:51.97]Open tray, close it quick.
[71:17.15]Wait.
[71:31.20]Wait a second.
[72:11.76]I ain't doing this again.
[72:14.60]This is the last time I'm doing this.
[72:40.55]All the problems are gone.
[72:41.51]They were though.
[72:42.37]They actually were.
[72:49.38]Put in a backwards compatible PS3.
[72:51.40]That's not going to do it.
[72:56.30]Here we go.
[73:08.85]Skip the cutscene fucking immediately.
[73:10.35]They already saw it.
[73:11.51]Go!
[73:11.93]Alright!
[73:12.95]Please, PlayStation 1, do it!
[73:44.19]Power on.
[73:45.18]Now let's start with this tree here.
[74:15.35]What?
[74:15.71]What are you... What is it talking about?
[74:23.84]I didn't... I'm not spamming!
[74:47.88]It's almost like it takes too long to get to the next note and you stop playing.
[75:20.75]All that we need is you to move in here There's no food around here Come on and get down way down to the low part And we're gonna make it to the top of all the Timberland Never use your chips, Jay, for them, no Damn it, personally, the crowd turned into a... Yeah!
[75:48.07]Just rule and all they love
[75:54.92]Alright, we're good.
[75:56.86]I wonder what levels are there in this game.
[76:39.47]We got it.
[76:40.30]No, I don't think it's going to happen again.
[76:44.18]This is like the last level.
[76:46.98]There's no way it's going to happen again.
[77:02.97]For one second I thought it was happening again.
[77:04.53]I thought that was actually it happening again.
[77:08.80]Alright.
[77:20.90]Straight to hell.
[77:29.87]Alright, so I went back in time.
[78:01.31]Who do you think you are coming in this late?
[78:05.02]Don't underestimate me just because I'm an idol.
[78:08.68]Come on, it's time to do it.
[78:11.13]Um, no, no, no, no, no.
[78:11.87]You see, I was on my way to my own show, but I ended up here.
[78:18.23]Anyways, I'll help you get to where you're going.
[78:20.77]Where's Hel?
[78:21.41]Really?
[78:22.35]Can you really do that?
[78:23.17]I mean, this is the original version.
[78:24.43]This is not like a... Only if you play right.
[78:27.11]Not even the real version.
[78:29.11]Yeah, that's right.
[78:30.47]This is the original PlayStation 1 version.
[78:33.51]Leave it to us.
[78:35.54]Enable.
[78:36.10]Oh.
[78:36.42]Really?
[78:37.56]Why would they censor Hel?
[78:50.42]Alright, don't.
[78:51.04]Please, just do it.
[78:51.82]Just do it.
[78:52.64]Do it.
[78:52.90]Yes.
[78:53.54]Alright, we're good.
[78:56.75]Alright, let's get cool on this one.
[78:58.61]That looks... That does not look very safe.
[79:01.71]It looked right.
[79:19.68]oh
[79:51.61]I can still go
[80:19.21]It doesn't... Start all over.
[80:21.23]You should be banned from every game.
[80:33.65]From every game?
[80:36.58]Even this one?
[80:40.30]Even this one.
[80:41.60]Oh no.
[80:44.76]Okay.
[80:45.64]I'm fucking destroying this.
[80:47.58]Let's go.
[80:49.32]Here we go.
[80:49.88]No fucking around now.
[80:51.42]Ready?
[80:51.70]Check this out.
[80:52.32]Here we go.
[81:18.39]You guys don't understand.
[81:19.65]This song...
[81:57.40]Fuck.
[81:57.70]If you don't understand the song, it's fucking weird.
[82:03.03]It's like the beat is off.
[82:04.19]What the fuck?
[82:09.15]I'm like playing to a different song.
[82:27.16]What did I do wrong then?
[82:34.32]Did somebody tell me?
[82:35.87]I... I... Huh?
[82:36.89]What?
[82:37.05]Just do the... I don't think you... I'm pressing the button when it goes over every time.
[82:44.17]Every game.
[82:57.56]Every game?
[82:58.78]Even this one?
[83:02.00]What the fuck?
[83:11.67]Even this one.
[83:15.41]It's not the controller.
[83:16.92]It's this shitty song!
[83:18.58]I'm still listening to your smoke and I can't play stream with you, babe.
[83:39.22]That was so... That was so fucking bad.
[83:42.86]Explain to me.
[83:43.72]That was the worst line I've ever done.
[83:46.52]And I still won.
[83:47.48]I still got it.
[83:50.60]What?
[83:51.00]No.
[83:52.04]No, no, no.
[83:52.36]I just wanted to pause the game.
[83:53.87]Why can't you pause video games back in the year 2000?
[83:56.43]Why can't you not pause video games back in 1999?
[84:11.99]What do you mean it's cheating?
[84:12.91]What if I have to go to the bathroom?
[84:15.21]What if I'm about to beat the level and I have to shit my pants?
[84:17.55]You have to hold it.
[84:29.08]I know you're the one that's gonna play it I'm Susan, you're Spoke and I can play Scream if you please
[84:45.40]I hate this song.
[85:18.23]Guys, I don't understand.
[85:24.93]Guys, seriously.
[85:26.51]You don't understand.
[85:44.84]Come on, bring it back!
[85:45.90]I don't want to do this again!
[85:47.36]I don't want to do this again!
[85:52.93]Come on, back up!
[85:53.77]Please!

[87:08.75]I didn't like that one.
[87:14.75]That's all I heard.
[87:16.27]I couldn't even hear the words.
[87:18.29]I just heard... They put this crazy filter on some of these voices.
[87:25.73]I can't even hear the words.
[87:27.01]Phew!

[90:19.97]That was awesome.

[90:37.40]But I'm not getting close.
[90:38.96]I'm just running, running around.
[90:41.21]Always at my best.
[90:42.93]I missed that one.
[90:44.23]I don't need no rest.
[91:19.46]Something's confusing me, so maybe it's my turn.
[91:43.86]Wait if I hold my hand on the PlayStation, okay, I have to have one hand on the PlayStation Okay
[92:19.66]Put your foot up there.
[92:20.40]Okay, that's a good idea.

[95:02.01]We want the full s- Come on.
[95:08.52]Just be patient with it.
[95:17.69]Turn the place into one upside down.
[95:25.33]What the fuck?!
[95:31.34]It's upside down!
[95:40.82]It's not fair!
[95:41.51]It's not fair how I lose.
[95:43.99]Come on, stop.
[95:51.06]It's a- it worked for a second.

[96:42.81]Oh, fuck.
[96:43.89]Oh, fuck.
[96:47.82]This is not good.
[96:50.78]Come on.
[96:51.04]Alright, turn it back up.
[96:53.54]Turn it back right side up.
[96:59.06]What if I just move it?
[96:59.92]I think I have to shake the PlayStation.
[97:02.75]Just, like, sway it back and forth.
[97:23.04]Okay, I'm almost there.
[97:24.60]I just gotta get good.
[97:25.66]Oh my god, come on!
[97:41.30]I don't want to-
[98:02.58]Do I get extra points?
[98:07.20]Upside down again It's dead
[98:32.83]Wait.
[98:35.91]Okay, I have a plan.
[98:38.29]I have a plan.
[98:39.76]The plan is that I have to get cool.
[98:42.16]I have to get cool.
[98:44.46]Otherwise it's a flop.
[98:49.84]I have a plan!
[98:51.96]It should work!
[98:57.86]I think the controls are backwards.
[99:29.91]from my town to midtown trying to get downtown
[100:18.64]I have to start over.
[100:25.97]I have to get cool or it's not happening.
[100:51.29]What?
[100:51.55]It worked last... Okay, I'll get it.
[101:03.45]Yeah!
[101:22.08]Get up, get up, trying to sack myself.
[101:27.33]Cause it doesn't work with no one else.
[101:35.21]All this hype all around.
[101:39.37]Seems like a waste of time.
[101:41.23]From uptown to midtown, trying to get downtown.
[101:48.32]But I'm not getting close.
[101:50.84]I'm just running, running around.
[101:57.66]Always in my best.
[102:00.33]Give me more best.
[102:03.93]I don't need no rest.
[102:06.79]It's my test now.
[102:10.33]And I'm in a beat.
[102:15.04]It's very unique.
[102:35.13]Did I win?
[102:35.99]Here it comes.
[102:37.39]Stop.
[103:07.02]Here we go.
[103:16.35]Why does that happen every time?
[103:18.73]It's three buttons.
[103:19.59]It's dun, dun, dun.
[103:22.09]It's like the sound's not playing long enough.
[103:31.89]What?
[103:32.43]Circle, square, triangle.
[103:34.92]Triangle!
[103:35.46]Square!
[103:35.86]Circle!
[103:37.64]Square!
[103:37.96]X!
[103:41.30]Triangle!
[103:41.86]X!
[103:41.96]Square!
[103:42.70]Circle!
[103:43.22]What happened?
[103:45.75]Square!
[103:46.17]Circle!
[103:46.67]X!
[103:46.87]Triangle!
[103:47.61]R!
[103:48.01]What happened?
[103:49.13]What happened?
[103:49.87]What happened?
[103:57.44]Am I even synced up for you guys?
[104:01.98]I'm done.
[104:07.74]Here we go.
[104:41.74]I'm just running, running around.
[105:12.58]Come on!
[105:30.23]I gotta go on I gotta go on I gotta get on
[105:36.46]See, like, getting cool is just like, you gotta just spam random shit.
[105:46.59]Burger Boy played Piraka the Rapper 1, and spammed every single loop, and got cool.
[105:51.53]On his first time ever playing it.
[106:01.05]Try to steer into gear.
[106:06.05]That's when I see you coming.
[106:09.42]You're creeping me from running.
[106:12.48]Get up, get up, trying to sack myself.
[106:33.66]That'd be cool.
[106:35.38]Why?
[107:32.41]It's about to break.
[107:34.59]It's about to break.
[107:35.49]I have to restart.
[107:37.11]If I don't get cool on this one...
[107:56.59]A break in the distance happened in my mind, and I'm going to save it because it's worth a lot of money.
[108:37.23]I'm just running, running around.
[109:06.71]That was it.
[109:08.43]That was it.
[109:09.41]That was it.
[109:13.17]That was actually it.
[109:14.55]I had to just do a huge thing there.
[109:17.15]Here we go.
[109:18.34]I'll get it this time.
[109:20.44]This is the one.
[109:25.84]Okay.
[109:30.54]Sometimes you have to get super points.
[109:36.88]Use the PlayStation 2, it's too late!
[110:06.14]This hype all around seems like a waste of time.
[110:14.05]From uptown to midtown, trying to get downtown.
[110:19.53]But I'm not getting close.
[110:25.15]I'm just running, running around.
[110:45.09]Oh, fuck, no!
[111:13.90]Guys, did I miss the part?
[111:15.24]No, what are we doing back here?
[111:17.29]What are we doing back here?
[111:18.31]Just gotta get it again.
[111:58.74]I'm going against the tide here, as they say.
[112:02.18]God damn it.
[112:08.19]I even got cool too, and then I wasn't cool enough to stay cool.
[112:13.73]Shit, I'm not breaking this disk.
[112:14.93]It's a great game.
[112:17.85]It was just sold to me by some motherfucker that didn't tell me that it was broken.
[112:32.54]That'll be like $50, please.
[112:34.06]Dickhead.
[112:34.48]I don't know how much this was.
[112:54.66]Somebody look it up.
[112:56.14]What's this going for right now?
[113:02.46]I had it too.
[113:03.48]Shit.
[113:04.22]Oh, I'm so disappointed.
[113:05.79]Oh, that's okay.
[113:08.19]It's alright.
[113:08.97]It's alright.
[113:09.63]Don't worry.
[113:11.11]There's no reason to fret over that.
[113:15.85]Shit.
[113:18.75]I would have had it the first time if it just didn't break.
[113:27.20]Okay.
[113:31.71]Dead Rising now?
[113:32.83]No, the stream's gonna turn off here in like 45 minutes.
[113:48.28]I'm doing- this is it.
[113:49.53]If it doesn't solve it here, just pretend I beat the game.
[114:10.37]That's how long you're going to play Dead Rising 1, given how bad it is?
[114:12.98]Dead Rising 1's a great game.
[114:14.72]What are you talking about?
[114:22.40]Alright, let's see if we can do this.
[114:36.46]Waste of time.
[114:37.70]Yeah, it's the kind of nature of this whole level, isn't it, so far?
[114:41.88]It's alright.
[114:43.02]I'm having a good time.
[114:44.22]This is the last level.
[114:45.26]No, it's not.
[114:45.90]Oh, fuck.
[114:47.58]The stream thumbnail is a blue screen.
[115:07.10]Alright, see if it's the last time we hear this.
[115:34.86]Downtown
[116:27.35]Wowee!
[116:29.67]Don't fuck it up, let's go!
[116:31.53]I wanna see some... Paul Champ!
[116:59.86]That sucks.
[117:00.65]I passed it.
[117:03.31]Alright, don't fuck it up.
[117:20.92]I passed it.
[117:22.40]I passed the glitching.
[118:09.41]It flipped it on me, and I instantly lost, apparently.
[118:21.98]What a fucking trick.
[118:25.78]Why?
[118:25.88]I even got too cool for like, about 60 seconds.
[118:29.64]Oh my god, why?
[118:32.13]Why?
[118:36.22]I'm about to leave.
[118:39.56]I gotta go home.
[118:41.40]I already am home.
[118:43.38]What was so wrong with that?
[119:07.75]From uptown to midtown Is this what hell feels like?
[119:10.78]No, they censored that.
[119:12.28]But I'm not getting close I'm just running, running around
[119:57.06]L-R- What the f- Dude, what the fuck does that- I- I- That's such- That's so fucked up!
[120:05.22]That part is such a mess!
[120:08.48]Even if I do it right!
[120:09.58]It doesn't make sense!
[120:37.56]It's so slow!
[120:38.69]You motherfucker.
[121:01.37]Hey!
[121:02.67]You see that?
[121:20.98]Let's get him out of this fucking game now.
[121:32.49]Let's get this prime to fuck me over at the very end of that.
[121:35.05]Oh, God.
[121:35.19]Thanks, everyone.
[121:35.75]Please.
[121:37.37]Please.
[121:37.81]Yeah, he's my next challenger.
[121:52.09]There he is.
[121:57.18]Okay.
[121:57.84]I did it.
[121:58.74]I'm ready.
[121:59.54]I'm ready.
[122:20.69]I would have beat it the first time.
[122:31.66]What?
[122:31.96]It was only the first time he did it.
[122:38.24]He didn't mess around and have the game crash mid-song.
[122:59.75]I was- I was talking!
[123:00.73]You couldn't hear me?
[123:03.03]What is he saying?
[123:06.31]I was saying somebody said if only he stopped dicking around in the beginning.
[123:11.03]I was- I've been trying to- I haven't switched consoles like five times!
[123:28.56]You should've just had an emulator.
[123:36.71]Illegal!
[123:57.67]You should have overclocked your PlayStation 1.
[124:02.67]Alright, so let's see.
[124:04.43]Wait, what's going on?
[124:08.62]Why is this running at like two frames a second?
[124:33.77]Why is that the post-credits thing?
[125:04.16]Hey Katie, I heard you started a band.
[125:08.25]Uh-huh.
[125:08.57]It's a great band.
[125:09.47]Can't we help?
[125:14.07]Yeah, we'd love to help.
[125:18.79]Hmm.
[125:28.79]It'd be nice if Sonny can design our costumes.
[125:31.63]Rappa, you can help us carry the equipment, buy snacks, and give us foot massages.
[125:36.53]Sure, like always.
[125:38.80]What about you, PJ?
[125:41.28]I'll have a chocolate frosty and a cherry pie.
[125:43.78]No, no, no, I'm talking about Katie's live show.
[125:46.06]What are you gonna do?
[125:47.66]Oh, then I'll have six chocolate frosties and a large cherry pie.
[126:04.64]Here we go.
[126:33.22]Get the fuck out of my way!
[126:49.20]He needs to eat some fucking vegetables.
[127:16.13]We be on the road, putting on a show, letting people know, jam, together, together, together, jam, jam.
[127:59.93]Push the button and just pull the chain.
[128:01.55]Uh-oh.
[128:01.71]Uh-oh.
[128:01.99]Uh-oh.
[128:02.19]Push the button and just pull the chain.
[128:05.07]Push the button and just pull the chain.
[128:09.14]And just push the button and just pull the chain.
[128:11.40]And I'm forming a chain.
[128:32.13]No!
[128:32.33]No, I gotta get out of here!
[128:35.31]I have to leave now!
[128:36.23]I have to leave now!
[128:37.65]Uh...
[129:11.20]No.
[129:11.90]No.
[129:12.64]Alright.
[129:12.94]That's it.
[129:14.04]That's it.
[129:14.38]That's it.
[129:15.02]That's it.
[129:15.88]That's the stream.
[129:16.44]I'm out of here.
[129:20.46]My stomach hurts.
[129:21.12]I have to leave.
[129:26.24]No.
[129:26.88]Okay.
[129:29.24]I will see you tomorrow.
[129:31.57]I have to... As the term goes.
[129:38.87]I got to get out of here.
[129:42.35]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[129:48.71]Unfortunately, we ran into technical problems with the Umjammer Lamy disk.
[129:55.13]We'll... be back tomorrow.
[129:59.79]We're going to play Trine tomorrow with Star.
[130:03.92]So that'll be just kind of a chill stream.
[130:07.92]Solving puzzles and shit I think Ashley's going to come to.
[130:14.25]So that should be a good one.
[130:15.09]And then we're going to get away from the PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 stuff.
[130:19.59]We're going to play The Thing on probably Monday.
[130:28.16]So I'll see you guys later.
[130:29.32]Thanks for watching.
[130:32.02]This was a lot of fun.
[130:34.77]Guitar Man was awesome.
[130:36.67]This was fun too.
[130:38.71]Hope you enjoyed yourselves.
[130:41.05]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[130:43.65]Take care.
[130:44.71]If you're sticking around to do the bits... Hey, look, I gifted 100 subs again.
[130:51.24]We'll get to them.
[130:55.22]Tomorrow's stream, by the way, is going to be starting... Actually, no, it'll be normal.
[131:01.12]Never mind.
[131:02.12]For some reason, I was like, no, it will.
[131:05.26]Somewhere around 1 or 2 o'clock Pacific.
[131:10.73]Dodge?
[131:11.19]What?
[131:14.43]What did I do?
[131:17.15]Yeah, this shit just don't work.
[131:21.85]It kind of... It just... That doesn't make any sense.
[131:26.32]It's all good, though.
[131:27.88]Eventually, I will fix this.
[131:28.94]Okay.
[131:46.27]My fucking stomach hurts.
[131:48.27]So... God damn it.
[131:53.94]I don't know what to even say.
[131:56.08]What do you even say?
[132:04.05]Uh, thank you from earlier.
[132:05.19]We had...
[132:18.24]What's wrong with chat?
[132:20.12]Nothing.
[132:20.44]Don't worry.
[132:22.27]Don't look into it.
[132:23.57]Trust.
[132:23.83]Don't worry.
[132:25.49]Freddy Dredd had 10,000 bits earlier.
[132:27.19]Thank you, Freddy Dredd.
[132:32.84]We caught it, but I just want to say thanks again.
[132:36.38]Uh, Daffy Jones, thanks for the 500 bits.
[132:39.00]They say, please get well soon, Jerma.
[132:41.15]Let us pray together for your swift recovery.
[132:43.45]Our boomer who streamed from Vegas, ancient by thy name, thy carnival come, thy jokes be repeats on Earth as it is in Jupiter.
[132:51.07]Give us this day our daily laughs and forgive us of our minus twos as we forgive thy late streams.
[132:55.90]Lead us not into cock's high-speed internet, but deliver us from yellow skin.
[133:01.90]Amen.
[133:05.53]Those of you that missed the beginning of the stream, I had a weird scare today that just kind of have to go watch it.
[133:14.37]It's a long-winded thing.
[133:17.91]I couldn't, I wouldn't, I can't even explain what it was.
[133:21.35]It's too, it's too long.
[133:24.61]But thank you, Daffy Jones.
[133:25.61]Appreciate that.
[133:27.05]Tingy, thanks for the 250.
[133:28.11]Jerma, before you get the liver scan, go to the grocery store, buy the freshest liver you can, and get the doctor to scan that.
[133:34.37]He'll get back to you with healthy results and you'll feel better in no time.
[133:37.63]Uh, those li- those livers- those livers are dead.
[133:43.05]I don't think that's a good idea.
[133:51.11]But healthy.
[133:53.25]Deadly healthy.
[133:57.83]Thank you, Ting.
[134:00.11]Uh, thank you, C4G, for the 350.
[134:02.85]Guitaroman was one of the first games I owned, and I think the very first game I actually beat.
[134:07.12]I love this game, and I can't wait to see you 100% every level first try.
[134:10.86]And then they do the That's Me face.
[134:17.73]It was fun.
[134:20.86]It was just maybe the controller I was using.
[134:22.62]I still can't believe that I could have used the PlayStation 1 controller and it was right behind me the whole time.
[134:27.16]It was just right under my nose.
[134:28.04]Yeah, but then I can't be... I can't open it on stream and look strong.
[134:31.63]Ugh.
[134:47.47]Hey, SpookySpitfire, thanks for the 250.
[134:48.73]So first things first, I'm done with Dark Souls 3 on my run.
[134:53.42]I had beat Orphan first try.
[134:54.78]I don't know how you did that.
[134:58.32]I've never beaten Orphan before, which is even more surprising.
[135:00.42]How do you beat Orphan first try?
[135:04.14]That shit is, like, impossible.
[135:09.78]They said, also, I had you muted.
[135:11.75]I muted your stream and played Ludwig's theme over it, and it made the first music fight a million times better.
[135:18.08]Did it match up, though?
[135:18.88]That's more important, I think.
[135:26.07]Just don't get hit.
[135:26.89]Yeah, but that's hard.
[135:32.13]Thank you, SpookySpitfire.
[135:33.11]Appreciate it.
[135:35.57]Yeah, Orphan of Kos.
[135:36.27]What do you think I was talking about?
[135:41.49]Good luck with the rest of your... You got anything else to do?
[135:46.92]Oh, you gotta do Sekiro now.
[135:48.28]Uh-oh.
[135:50.78]Good luck.
[135:53.80]Thank you, Backin, for the $2.50.
[135:54.56]Thank you for streaming, as always.
[135:55.88]You never cease to entertain.
[135:56.68]It's my birthday today, and I want to thank Stevie, the ex-Evie, for helping out.
[136:04.01]Also, have a great one, chat.
[136:07.05]Alright.
[136:09.19]Happy birthday.
[136:12.07]Hope you had a good one.
[136:13.75]And thanks, Stevie, for helping out.
[136:17.59]Appreciate it.
[136:21.03]That guy, Tag, gave $20, 2000 bits.
[136:31.21]They say, Jerm, hello Jerm, this is one of my favorite games ever made.
[136:36.50]The PS2 version has iffy controls, the PSP version does the best, I still play it to this day.
[136:41.08]It was awesome.
[136:43.32]It was great.
[136:43.84]I mean, back then, that was pretty well done.
[136:51.70]But thanks a lot, Tag.
[136:57.68]No, not the Rome game.
[136:59.00]Yeah, the Rome game.
[137:08.58]No, he's talking about Guitarro Man.
[137:16.02]Because there's a... Should I?
[137:17.88]No.
[137:21.44]Rome game.
[137:23.42]Oh my fucking god, that's funny.
[137:30.36]Hamtaro Man?
[137:33.64]What are you guys talking about?
[137:34.74]Isn't that a hamster thing?
[137:41.63]But anyways, Tag, thanks so much for the 20 fucking dollars, the 2,000 bits.
[137:51.75]Good to see you.
[137:55.84]I was watching the Tip of the Hat stream for a little bit.
[138:00.82]Tried to throw you guys a host on Saturday.
[138:09.69]You guys did a great fucking thing, so good on you guys.
[138:19.96]But that was Tag.
[138:21.14]And, by the way, go follow Tag.
[138:23.61]Please put Tag's channel here.
[138:31.17]Really, really, really good, dude.
[138:32.51]Alright, I'll just do it.
[138:37.02]I got it right here.
[138:47.62]Oh, somebody did it first.
[138:54.25]Who's today's top subgifter?
[138:59.91]Me, apparently.
[139:01.09]But thanks, Tag.
[139:02.51]Go follow Tag if you don't.
[139:05.82]Vilemi, right after that, gave 2,000 bits as well.
[139:09.88]$20 from Vilemi right after that, too.
[139:12.02]Streamer is pretending to be bad, and then they do jermaSour.
[139:18.41]He's pretending.
[139:19.79]He's always pretending.
[139:21.16]That's just what he does.
[139:22.10]He just pretends to miss keys.
[139:25.76]He pretends to get hit and fall off cliffs.
[139:29.06]That's what he does.
[139:29.84]He's a pretender.
[139:30.96]He's a liar.
[139:32.20]Don't trust him.
[139:33.44]Don't trust anything he says.
[139:40.65]No, thank you, though.
[139:42.47]Thanks for the $20.
[139:43.97]Thank you, Multitrip, for the 250 worst sounding stream 2019.
[139:49.56]I get it.
[139:49.92]Because of the guitar.
[139:50.98]Okay.
[139:51.28]Yeah.
[139:52.52]Thanks for the 250.
[139:53.26]Appreciate it.
[139:54.08]Uh, Debakaryman, thanks for the 500 bits.
[139:55.94]When's the Elite Beat Agent stream?
[140:00.00]I need to compile a bunch of stuff for the DS.
[140:04.51]And... Get it captured.
[140:07.79]I think there's a way you can mod a DS and have it capturable.
[140:14.13]Because I know... Look, I know emulators exist.
[140:16.03]And I have used them before.
[140:18.19]But something's different about them.
[140:21.19]And sometimes they can be hard to set up.
[140:22.97]Especially when you get towards the PS2, PS3 stuff.
[140:27.00]I know that these games are all emulatable, but I like playing on original hardware.
[140:31.54]I actually do like doing it.
[140:33.14]It kind of feels better to me.
[140:36.59]Modding the DS is a crime.
[140:38.63]It is?
[140:40.67]Why?
[140:46.45]Wait, I can't, like, put a capture card in a DS?
[140:48.63]Why is that illegal?
[140:57.61]Well, but I do like playing on mostly, if I can, original hardware.
[141:04.72]If it's possible.
[141:09.32]Modifying the software.
[141:10.94]Well, then I'll pump my webcam at it.
[141:12.24]Whatever, who cares?
[141:13.04]We'll go back to, like, fucking 2009.
[141:22.58]Yeah, you got a fake PS2 controller.
[141:24.78]No, I have a real PS1 controller back there, but a fake PS2 controller because, um, that's what it came with.
[141:31.84]And I was too lazy to go get, like, the real PlayStation.
[141:34.25]It's a real PlayStation.
[141:35.15]It's just an off-brand one.
[141:42.11]But, thank you, uh, debauchery man.
[141:44.11]Maybe at some point in the future.
[141:45.99]We'll see.
[141:47.43]C4G, thanks for the 250.
[141:48.41]I don't know how you managed to do that with your wonky sticks, but I'm glad we got to hear all the bangers.
[141:53.77]Most of them, anyways.
[141:54.47]A couple of notes got lost in the process.
[141:57.16]I really wish this got a re-release for modern systems because I really love this game.
[142:00.64]Thanks for showing it.
[142:03.22]I think the rhythm game is due for a big comeback.
[142:11.51]And I'm not talking about the Guitar Hero.
[142:16.38]I'm talking the original rhythm game stuff.
[142:24.51]And it looks like the initial tremors are starting here.
[142:30.33]You've got Space Channel 5, isn't that going to come back?
[142:36.18]Isn't there a new rhythm heaven game?
[142:38.54]Or didn't one just recently release or one's coming out?
[142:44.64]Guitar Hero 1 and 2 was fun.
[142:46.24]No, those games were so much fun, but licensed video game soundtracks, you know what I mean?
[142:52.71]Like, you're actually playing the guitar to Van Halen, not a Parappa the Rapper-style original songs with a little fun, cute, original storyline.
[143:07.76]I think you'll see a little bit more of that come back.
[143:13.84]It goes in cycles, doesn't it?
[143:16.66]Jerma sounds so constipated.
[143:21.22]Look, I know that that's like a meta joke reference.
[143:24.79]That's a meta reference to the fact that you found out today that I'm on prescription-grade laxatives.
[143:31.21]I know that that's why you're saying that, and you've turned it.
[143:35.27]You've turned the key here, and now I'm angry.
[143:39.45]I'm angry with you.
[143:40.97]I'm angry with you.
[143:43.55]What do you care?
[143:48.88]Bird's just like, whatever, I don't fucking care, whatever.
[143:55.20]Nah, I'm just kidding.
[143:56.45]Anyways, uh, where were we?
[143:57.73]We're here.
[143:58.07]Uh, snowflakes, am I right?
[144:02.63]Say for 250, thanks for the 250.
[144:06.43]Yo, Jeremy, your streams have been a comfort of mine for a while.
[144:09.21]I made some portraits of you and Kim, because why not?
[144:11.95]Here they are.
[144:12.45]I'll upload them to my Insta if you are still chill with that.
[144:15.53]Thanks for the laughs.
[144:18.43]Throw these into the Community Content Night channel.
[144:26.60]Toss them in there.
[144:28.50]We'll pull them out during that next night, which will probably be pretty soon, actually.
[144:40.19]Let me see.
[144:40.63]What day is it?
[144:44.46]Today's the 19th.
[144:46.72]I would probably say somewhere... Maybe there's enough to do it before Halloween.
[144:52.36]It's possible.
[145:02.47]Is it 19... Monday and then...
[145:07.57]24, 25, 26.
[145:07.73]Or, yeah.
[145:12.84]Let me see.
[145:13.70]If I can't do it before the Halloween stream happens, then it'll be early November for sure.
[145:18.94]But, those of you that, I guess, I actually have to put this down in the description down below.
[145:27.77]That artwork and videos are not going to be opened at the end of streams anymore.
[145:32.13]They're going to go into that Discord channel.
[145:35.69]If you have anything that you want to show on stream, we do a community content night once a month.
[145:42.40]Where we compile all of them and we go through and we have a whole stream where everybody comes and hangs out there.
[145:48.98]Rather than have at the end of streams, you know, 30, 40, 50% of people will take off, because obviously it's like, oh, the stream's over, I got other shit I want to do and see you later, but that's, you know, that's fine, right?
[146:01.45]So... That was kind of the idea, is to have them all compiled, rather than have them open at the end of the stream.
[146:10.07]But please, please, please put them in that community content on the Discord.
[146:12.91]If you don't know where the Discord is, it's right here.
[146:15.11]It's a public open Discord.
[146:19.55]Join it.
[146:19.83]It's a great community.
[146:23.06]Look forward to seeing what you do.
[146:24.24]And make sure you watermark all your shit.
[146:26.56]So I know who it's from.
[146:29.34]Very important.
[146:33.20]But thank you so much.
[146:34.01]I look forward to seeing it.
[146:38.39]Thank you for the 250.
[146:38.93]Really.
[146:43.09]PlankV2, thanks for the 1100 bits.
[146:47.30]Fun fact, gladiators didn't die every fight because they were too expensive to replace.
[146:51.95]It's a fact, I guess.
[147:01.23]Is that true?
[147:03.40]Interesting.
[147:05.10]Thank you, Plank, for the $11.
[147:09.20]Look directly at the Discord channel when I do it next time.
[147:13.35]Yeah, but then I have to, like, cap Discord.
[147:16.25]And you can't really, like, full-screen Discord.
[147:18.95]It's still messages that you have to open, and... I'd rather just do it the way that I did before.
[147:26.97]Gladiators weren't real.
[147:28.17]What?
[147:30.01]Hey, Appleship, thanks for the $2.50.
[147:31.47]Hey, man, I need to submit my senior quote for the yearbook by the end of November.
[147:34.21]Can you come up with one for me?
[147:35.21]Choose wisely.
[147:36.41]This would be my high school legacy forever.
[147:41.93]Um, okay.
[147:43.98]Use this one.
[147:48.03]Start the quote.
[147:52.67]Keep your eyes on the prize.
[147:54.59]The road to success is always under construction.
[148:03.82]Pretty fucking goddamn good, if you ask me.
[148:13.80]Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring.
[148:18.76]That's what my mother used to say to me.
[148:21.16]That's a quote from my mother.
[148:22.46]You're making fun of my mother?
[148:23.53]Are you making fun of my mother, Mrs. Elbertson?
[148:28.57]Huh.
[148:36.27]I didn't end quote yet.
[148:39.19]Oh, well, end it.
[148:40.61]There.
[148:40.73]There.
[148:47.14]That's not a good quote.
[148:48.62]That's not a good quote.
[148:50.44]That's too long for a yearbook.
[148:56.96]You can't use that one.
[148:58.02]Just use the first part of that that I said.
[149:00.13]Not the other end of it.
[149:03.69]Oh, God.
[149:04.43]Well, anyways.
[149:06.87]Congratulations.
[149:08.91]Take care.
[149:09.29]Thank you, AppleShift.
[149:14.50]Hey! Heavy min, thanks for the 500 bits. I would absolutely love to see you play Dead Rising. Genuinely my favorite game of all time.
[149:21.50]I even did all the awful, awful achievements for it. Including the survive for 14 literal hours by doing nothing one.
[149:29.50]You know? That's gonna be a really really fun stream.
[149:34.50]Because don't you have to like make choices on who survives and stuff?
[149:43.79]And it's a time limit, right?
[149:44.85]Yeah, that's gonna be a ton of fun.
[149:52.48]I'm gonna do that sooner rather than later.
[149:54.82]That might end up happening before Halloween.
[150:00.77]I've never played it.
[150:01.49]I've seen people play that game.
[150:04.05]And me and Star played Dead Rising 2?
[150:07.13]Dead Rising 3?
[150:07.97]But we didn't even get out of the fucking first room.
[150:10.95]I think we made it 10 minutes into the game and we were just throwing shit at each other.
[150:14.81]I don't remember.
[150:15.27]There's a video on it.
[150:19.01]I think it was 2.
[150:19.37]Yeah, I've never played the first one.
[150:28.25]We played Dead Rising 3 as well.
[150:31.88]I've played every Dead Rising game for like two hours each.
[150:35.28]Except for the first one.
[150:39.08]Dead Rising 4?
[150:40.12]I don't even remember which one it was.
[150:42.54]Hey, Master Chicken, thanks for the 1,500 bits.
[150:44.74]15 bucks from Master Chicken.
[150:45.82]Thank you.
[150:46.90]Jeremiah, I almost pissed my pants when the disk started skipping.
[150:49.18]There are tears pouring down my face.
[150:50.64]I mean, it was fucking crazy.
[150:54.79]So, hopefully you're alright.
[151:03.07]Thank you, StifunkyChicken, for the 300 bits.
[151:05.25]If Steve is short for Stevius, then Jerma is short for a 34-year-old man.
[151:22.42]Nice.
[151:24.44]Got him, yeah.
[151:27.14]I mean, I'm gonna read it, whatever.
[151:28.90]I don't care.
[151:32.79]Uh, thank you, jvives, for the 500 bits.
[151:34.87]Hey, Jerma, it's Josh.
[151:37.07]We met in Las Vegas.
[151:39.24]I finally used the Prime sub like I promised.
[151:41.42]Keep on going strong.
[151:43.24]I do remember that.
[151:45.38]Yep.
[151:46.88]Kim and I were out to dinner.
[151:49.28]We were trying to find, like, new places to go.
[151:54.18]And this dude walked up to us.
[151:56.77]Just was... By the way, this was, like, last week.
[152:03.55]No, not VR, Josh.
[152:07.67]Kim and I were like, oh, where do you want to go?
[152:09.33]Let's try some, like, new places we fucking don't go.
[152:11.72]I was like, oh, what about here?
[152:16.46]How about here?
[152:17.14]How about there?
[152:18.92]Yeah.
[152:20.62]And then he flashed you.
[152:21.66]No, that did not happen.
[152:27.19]No, new places.
[152:35.74]Rate the Vegas buffets worst to best.
[152:39.93]There's like 700 of them.
[152:43.61]I can't do that.
[152:50.91]Here's the thing about Vegas though.
[152:53.27]Vegas has more restaurants and more places to eat than any place I've ever been on Earth.
[153:00.54]There are probably like 2,000 restaurants in Las Vegas.
[153:03.60]It's fucking crazy.
[153:06.35]It's overwhelming.
[153:09.20]And they're all good.
[153:11.04]They're all good, except for... Well, hold on.
[153:13.12]I don't want to get ahead of myself there.
[153:22.44]Do I have a Yeti restaurant?
[153:24.04]What?
[153:25.92]Hash House of Go-Go is the best restaurant I've ever been to.
[153:28.76]In Vegas.
[153:30.20]That's in the link.
[153:32.22]Please.
[153:33.38]Please go if you're ever in Vegas.
[153:39.28]Do a Vegas restaurant tier list.
[153:40.96]It would not happen.
[153:41.99]But anyways, no, I do remember.
[153:42.97]Kim and I were just like walking around and it was just like, hey.
[153:48.81]What's up?
[153:50.95]And you used the prime sub like you promised.
[153:55.03]That's fucking awesome.
[153:56.53]It was a pleasure.
[153:57.51]Thanks for saying hello.
[153:58.43]Seriously.
[154:03.61]Hope you had a good rest of your trip.
[154:04.79]I know that you were on a trip.
[154:08.35]You would just kind of stop it in and... Demand a sub from the guy.
[154:13.83]No, that's not what happened.
[154:18.41]Now, if anybody ever sees me... And look, I know that... I currently live... In a destination city.
[154:27.88]And there are a lot of places that you could potentially just see me.
[154:32.53]Because there's so much to do here.
[154:36.35]There's a bunch of stuff to do on Strip.
[154:38.59]There's a bunch of stuff off Strip.
[154:39.93]There's a bunch of stuff downtown.
[154:41.73]And some of the other areas and towns and communities and stuff.
[154:45.99]So I know that there's a lot of people that go to Vegas all the time.
[154:50.04]People have said already that, hey, I'm going to be in Vegas.
[154:55.84]I'm going to be in Vegas.
[154:56.55]I'm going to be in Vegas.
[154:57.41]So if you end up just seeing me somewhere, do not hesitate to say hello.
[155:04.06]That doesn't... It's not gonna bother me.
[155:05.98]Don't worry about that.
[155:15.45]I was there in September, but I didn't see him.
[155:21.00]What if I try to bother you?
[155:23.52]Well, then... I will get security.
[155:26.80]Okay.
[155:28.54]They're everywhere.
[155:30.06]I will just go.
[155:31.10]Excuse me, sir.
[155:33.04]This person's trying to bother me.
[155:37.90]What do you mean he hates us?
[155:38.93]Somebody just said it.
[155:39.77]What if I was trying to bother you?

[158:53.39]Hey, just making sure you met your quota for one reference per stream of a certain thing.
[158:59.29]I didn't hear one yet, and I don't want you to break your three-year streak.
[159:05.62]Not gonna happen.
[159:11.32]Thank you, FreudianWeapon, for the 500 bits.
[159:14.10]Thank you.
[159:20.01]The game glitching out made my night.
[159:21.48]My bro and I laughed so hard our heads were hurting, so thanks for the laughs.
[159:26.24]I mean, it was a shit show.
[159:31.28]I already forgot your name, how to pronounce it.
[159:35.75]I'm so sorry.
[159:36.77]I remember, like, two days ago, I was corrected on this.
[159:41.13]It's C, Zex, and S. And I've already forgot it.
[159:50.65]I don't remember.
[159:54.07]Zexen?
[159:55.01]Chexen?
[159:55.37]It was Chexen.
[159:57.86]Okay, right, right.
[159:59.80]Chexen.
[160:01.78]I will remember next time, I promise.
[160:03.64]Chexen gave five community subs.
[160:08.09]Thanks for the five subs, Chexen.
[160:11.64]And then we had Don't Start Let Me for the 550 bits.
[160:17.38]Play the Yeti game.
[160:18.32]You'll get Yeti nightmares.
[160:20.56]I don't know what that is.
[160:23.97]Why?
[160:24.23]Is this a Terminator emote?
[160:29.63]Why is there a Terminator emote?
[160:31.39]That's like not even the Terminator.
[160:33.15]That's like the Mortal Kombat DLC Terminator.
[160:39.76]DinoPulseZetta, thanks for the five community subs right now.
[160:43.92]Thank you.
[160:44.24]Appreciate it.
[160:52.08]Thanks for the five subs.
[160:54.26]Uh, Ishanji, thanks for the 2,000 bits, $20.
[160:57.54]Hey, funny streamer, Jeremy.
[161:00.66]Love your streams, never seen anyone so determined to finish a physically defective game before.
[161:04.95]Well, I bought it.
[161:08.23]Yeah, look, okay, hold on.
[161:09.53]It's real easy to be like, ah, just, like, skip this one.
[161:12.09]Just throw it in the trash, break it, burn it.
[161:17.03]I bought this game.
[161:18.11]I don't want to just, like, break it.
[161:19.91]I mean, if it was Guy Fieri... The Guy Fieri game, who cares?
[161:31.45]Look, I've only destroyed two or three games on stream.
[161:34.81]Ever.
[161:35.13]In, like, six years.
[161:36.69]Eight?
[161:36.89]No.
[161:37.17]Like, ten years.
[161:38.99]The Guy Fieri...
[161:41.10]Minute to win it game.
[161:42.76]I shredded.
[161:43.96]Okay?
[161:44.92]Which, by the way, do not do that.
[161:46.12]Don't try that at home.
[161:46.76]It's not safe.
[161:47.86]Do not shred anything that, unless you are certain that it is a shredder that is capable of doing what you are trying to do, read the instructions.
[161:57.02]Don't do that at home, first of all.
[161:58.70]Second of all, Army of Two was the other one that I broke in half.
[162:07.28]I've never broken another game on stream.
[162:10.11]At least in the four and a half years plus that I've done this.
[162:16.31]So, come on, I don't break games.
[162:23.71]And then, so the second part here.
[162:26.95]Any chance you'll stream Tale of the Sun someday?
[162:30.47]It's a PS1 caveman simulator where you try to build a tower to the sun out of mammoth bones.
[162:37.03]Uh, well, you just put a new game on the list.
[162:41.59]And they say, one of the more unique games on the system.
[162:44.23]Also, here's a clip to commemorate your legendary freestyle today.
[162:49.82]Your legendary freestyle today.
[162:51.34]Uh, hold on.
[162:58.74]What was my legendary freestyle?
[163:07.88]Oh, right, right.
[163:10.14]We don't have to listen to this.
[163:12.84]It happened already.
[163:15.68]Thanks.
[163:19.04]We don't have to listen to that.
[163:22.70]Thanks for the 20.
[163:25.97]Thanks for the $20.
[163:26.81]Seriously, 2,000 bits.
[163:28.43]And I'll put that on the list, Tale of the Sun.
[163:31.15]Next time I do some PS1 stuff, for sure.
[163:35.00]Sir Canine, thanks for the 500 bits.
[163:40.09]They say, hey, hey, Jerma, here's a funny video.
[163:43.15]Uh, I'm gonna... Videos go in the community content night, if it's about the community, but I know it's not, because I have memorized the, like, first five letters of this link, and I know what it is.
[163:59.40]It is this.
[164:03.08]I know what it is already.
[164:08.30]So, that's fine.
[164:11.38]I'm prepared.
[164:16.80]But thank you, SirKanon, for the $5.
[164:18.22]And then finally, Colusia, thank you for the 300 bits.
[164:23.39]The stream made me laugh so hard my sides are killing me.
[164:25.31]Thank you, Jeremiah.
[164:26.25]Also, here's a picture of my cat cuddling my Andy Mark goat.
[164:31.17]What the f- what the fuck?
[164:41.73]Hold on.
[164:43.85]Holy shit.
[164:47.13]Look, look.
[165:07.47]So sleepy.
[165:09.29]That's cute.
[165:10.47]That's really cute.
[165:12.76]Well, thank you for this.
[165:13.96]This is great.
[165:16.70]Looks very sleepy.
[165:24.42]Thanks a lot, though.
[165:25.22]Seriously.
[165:26.89]And that's it.
[165:28.01]I'll see you guys tomorrow for Trine.
[165:30.87]Star and I are going to play Trine.
[165:31.93]We're going to do the three Triners.
[165:36.91]Expect tomorrow to be more of just a chill-out stream.
[165:41.71]I would imagine.
[165:43.70]We're just going to play Trine.
[165:46.20]The new one.
[165:48.40]Take care, guys.
[165:48.86]See you soon.
[165:49.62]See you tomorrow.
[165:51.86]Have a great rest of your night.
[165:53.86]And that is where we end this stream.
[165:57.74]Good night, guys.
[166:39.26]you
