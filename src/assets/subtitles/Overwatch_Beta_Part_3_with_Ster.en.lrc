[00:07.93]Hi.
[00:14.06]People chatting?
[00:14.64]Is people chatting in this chat?
[00:23.13]uh,
[00:36.09]I don't know.
[00:36.72]I haven't played this game in like a long time.
[00:39.47]It's been like a month since I played this game.
[00:41.87]It's been like two months.
[00:44.66]Not really.
[00:44.97]It's been like a week.
[00:47.03]It's like a week in Jerma times, like two months.
[00:50.76]Sun is shining.
[00:52.02]It's a beautiful day.
[00:53.85]Snowy, but it's still beautiful.
[00:58.00]Start with some McCree.
[01:06.32]Yeah, we do have a Jerma camp today.
[01:22.15]Who's this streamer?
[01:23.31]I know.
[01:23.81]There's a streamer here.
[01:27.83]How does the US have snow but Canada does not?
[01:29.76]Canada has snow like all the time.
[01:32.46]You should be happy that Canada doesn't have any snow right now.
[01:35.29]It's like the snow capital of the world.
[01:50.29]Play some Zenyatta.
[01:56.10]Overwatch main A stream?
[01:58.76]Stardew Valley, I'm not sure what to do in Stardew Valley anymore.
[02:02.04]I'm at the point in Stardew Valley where it's like,
[02:04.94]I'm kind of just walking around aimlessly, trying to find things to do.
[02:13.31]Your brother farted in your face.
[02:14.62]What do you have to say about that?
[02:19.16]Tell on him.
[02:19.90]Don't go tell your mother.
[02:28.68]Hey, good morning.
[02:29.79]What time is it right now?
[02:30.96]What time is it like in the world?
[02:32.95]I don't even know what time it is.
[02:44.31]Nightbot always does this.
[02:45.52]Nightbot, I am live.
[02:47.18]I promise.
[02:57.84]I better have changed the sub sound.
[02:59.57]Well...
[03:01.78]I may have.
[03:04.39]It was too long.
[03:05.24]It was out of control last time.
[03:08.02]I didn't know that, this is how stupid I am, having like a 20 second sub sound.
[03:14.60]When there's more than, like, three or four people subbing in a row, it's just, it just, it just goes crazy.
[03:20.64]You saw what happened.
[03:21.45]I, like, lost total control.
[03:24.56]I was laughing, I was like falling down stairs.
[03:29.16]I'm absolutely going to play Dark Souls 3.
[03:37.65]I'm looking forward to it for sure.
[03:46.71]Facecam's too small.
[03:48.00]I think it's too big.
[03:51.74]I'm going to have to change that.
[03:57.09]Who's even on the team?
[03:58.20]I don't even know what we have for like a comp right now.
[04:01.36]I didn't even look.
[04:07.45]Wow people over there lots of people
[04:16.75]Give me the turret, give me the turret.
[04:19.04]It's so close.
[04:21.65]I almost just died for that.
[04:26.37]That was not a smart thing to do.
[04:29.47]Did they have more than one Torbjörn?
[04:38.49]Hurts down and... Don't pull me!
[04:40.80]Oh, he pulled me!
[04:44.64]Actually, I might be able to kill him.
[04:45.65]I got him.
[04:48.66]Got him.
[04:54.19]I thought we were going to get a justice.
[04:55.56]That's why I did it.
[05:04.00]Going good.
[05:14.21]GOING GOOD.
[05:26.85]Watch out.
[05:29.79]Don't die, Tracer.
[05:30.64]Let me get you an orb before you jump around like that.
[05:38.34]I'm on fire.
[05:38.92]That's a good thing.
[05:40.89]I made you get Stardew Valley?
[05:42.01]Well, that's good because the game's good.
[05:45.21]It's a very good game.
[05:50.80]Ooh, don't want to die there.
[05:57.44]I'll get him.
[05:58.05]I'll get him.
[06:00.64]Wow.
[06:02.15]Even with an orb Discord on.
[06:06.35]Even with an Orbit Discord, doesn't even matter.
[06:15.30]whatever not a big deal
[06:25.90]What's wrong with the chat?
[06:27.34]Something happen in the chat?
[06:29.66]Everybody calm down.
[06:36.19]The outcome is not
[06:47.93]Have I ever been informed that I have a slice of burnt banana bread?
[06:51.13]What is that?
[06:51.53]What the hell does that mean?
[06:53.60]What does that mean?
[06:54.14]Where am I going?
[06:54.65]I'm going the wrong way.
[06:55.21]Going the wrong way.
[07:00.15]That was a 95%.
[07:01.18]This should go pretty well.
[07:05.69]I can't move.
[07:07.69]The sniper's gonna kill me if I move.
[07:09.52]What are you doing over here?
[07:10.78]What are you doing over here?
[07:14.07]We have to push through.
[07:22.92]What is that?
[07:23.50]Somebody just subscribed.
[07:24.30]Where's my sub sound?
[07:25.15]What happened?
[07:29.31]Hold on a second, this is important.
[07:31.37]What?
[07:32.29]I just changed it.
[07:33.28]Maybe I didn't save the settings.
[07:40.36]Oh, what?
[07:41.19]Hold on.
[07:41.84]It's important to hear this.
[07:47.17]That's gonna get fixed, don't worry.
[07:49.11]But thanks, Cricket, for subscribing.
[07:51.70]I just changed it, too.
[07:52.60]That's bullshit.
[07:54.23]I just put it on.
[07:57.81]Don't worry, you'll get it.
[08:00.88]I'll get it for you.
[08:09.20]Ugh, this sniper is fucking destroying me.
[08:21.42]You know, I actually heard.
[08:23.55]This is something that I've been told.
[08:25.84]The 64-bit version of OBS has, like, massive problems with...
[08:32.07]using Twitch alerts so maybe I'm just not gonna use the 64-bit version anymore
[08:37.79]I think that has something to do with it.
[08:40.14]But that's like, I don't know.
[08:41.25]That's weird.
[08:41.96]Shouldn't be happening.
[08:48.24]I might change.
[08:49.97]Yeah, I'm gonna change.
[08:50.79]I have an ult, but it might be time to change.
[08:59.14]How long am I gonna be streaming for?
[09:00.24]I'm not sure.
[09:02.64]Could be a little while, could be a few minutes, could be a few hours.
[09:05.57]I don't know.
[09:08.81]But regardless, thank you for subscribing Did I Get You Cricket.
[09:11.91]I like your name, and unfortunately your name...
[09:16.52]And then this audio is not even, look, do you see what, look, look what's happening.
[09:20.55]People are talking right now and I'm not hearing them, even though I'm in my, I'm in the channel.
[09:25.33]There's just weird shit like this happens all the time.
[09:28.78]It like turns off my sound.
[09:31.57]Alright, I'm gonna go somewhere else cause...
[09:35.64]I'm not sure how.
[09:37.18]If I don't get sniped.
[09:40.83]We're just all going in one by one.
[09:42.08]We're like so spread out right now.
[09:45.58]It's like, I'm gonna have to just... No.
[09:48.93]I'm gonna ult this guy.
[09:52.16]Don't snipe me, please!
[09:54.47]Let's go down and around.
[09:56.22]Let's go the other way.
[10:00.01]I use classic OBS.
[10:03.27]Alright, let's do it.
[10:06.00]Come with me!
[10:22.92]My computer has germs.
[10:24.95]Probably does.
[10:26.11]Wouldn't be surprised.
[10:28.10]I want to change.
[10:28.60]I want to change.
[10:29.04]I don't want to be Zenyatta anymore.
[10:36.76]Maybe Mercy.
[10:39.19]Try to get a rez.
[10:41.60]Try to get a rez off, you know?
[10:53.57]What products do I use on my skin?
[10:55.49]Uh, it's called Old Spice Hair and Body.
[10:59.81]I dumped the whole thing on myself.
[11:02.46]I just squeeze it on myself.
[11:07.25]Oh my god, we're getting kind of stuffed right now.
[11:10.31]They all just...
[11:11.04]I wish I was this character five minutes ago.
[11:13.19]I could have revived everybody.
[11:14.61]I could have like stick on someone.
[11:16.89]Like this person.
[11:22.24]Soak my computer in hot, spicy water.
[11:25.69]What's going on, Ronnie?
[11:26.43]Good to see you again, too.
[11:31.25]Ooh, that guy's getting... annihilated.
[11:34.06]Alright, I'm gonna have a...

[11:39.11]How many Roadhogs do we have?
[11:45.90]Whoa!
[11:46.76]Whoa!
[11:46.94]Person behind me!
[11:51.42]Nothing I can really do there.
[11:58.81]Lord Tater just subscribed for two months in a row.
[12:02.34]But look at this.
[12:03.84]What is going on with that?
[12:05.09]And why can I not hear people in the game in Overwatch?
[12:08.54]I swear to God, you know, Boo said this too.
[12:10.45]Boo, this is a Boo, BooMan61.
[12:13.65]When he said he closes Overwatch,
[12:16.19]It's like all of his sounds are gone on his computer.
[12:20.27]It's like, why does it happen?
[12:22.05]What is going on?
[12:31.91]So I'll just do it.
[12:33.52]Ah, a little French champagne.
[12:35.72]It's always been celebrated for its ex-
[12:42.39]Thanks for resubbing.
[12:43.90]Appreciate it.
[12:44.56]Welcome back.
[12:46.01]Welcome back to the family.
[12:48.41]It's supposed to be the trash man.
[12:58.39]I might give the stream a little restart.
[13:00.58]You know, figure out the problem at hand.
[13:03.66]Sounds like an issue that needs to be fixed.
[13:07.76]Because I do want to fix it.
[13:08.50]Because I do want it to be there.
[13:12.41]Did I recover from last night?
[13:13.54]Last night was crazy.
[13:14.54]That was insanity.
[13:17.31]Absolute insanity.
[13:18.33]We have 30 seconds.
[13:25.09]We're going to have one more push here, I think.
[13:27.16]That's going to be...
[13:31.22]I shouldn't have done that.
[13:31.86]That was a mistake.
[13:34.50]Oh, shouldn't have done that.
[13:43.78]I don't think it's gonna be enough.
[13:47.70]Oh well.
[13:52.10]What can you do?
[13:52.95]I might, I don't know.
[13:54.01]I might figure out what's going on.
[13:55.80]Who knows?
[14:00.19]Play the game.
[14:12.40]Everything about that just didn't feel good about that at all.
[14:28.05]I can't really say I feel that well either.
[14:29.87]Something doesn't feel right.
[14:34.34]I have this overwhelming sense of dread right now.
[14:36.90]I don't really know why.
[14:37.84]Something's bothering me.
[14:39.87]Is something wrong?
[14:42.81]I don't know.
[14:44.87]Hey, 2,000 damage done.
[14:46.16]That's not terrible.
[14:49.47]But, you know, whatever.
[14:51.99]I might, 28 objective time, that's not bad.
[14:55.65]What's going on?

[15:58.24]Winston's a good character.
[16:03.49]What's up?
[16:05.01]I'm feeling pretty good now, too.
[16:06.38]You know, we had some stream issues, but I can hear everything just fine.
[16:09.10]If you guys can't hear anything, it's on your end.
[16:10.51]Maybe you could try refreshing the stream.
[16:13.56]I'm gonna say, sup, dude, one more time.
[16:15.00]You know actually I'm having second thoughts about this Winston
[16:23.74]I think we could, I think we could help out.
