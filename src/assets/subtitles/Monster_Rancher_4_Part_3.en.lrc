[00:21.93]Any problems with no friends to call my own Crying as one to blood to see Everything that life had to offer me So many days were wasted looking at the ground
[01:16.60]Hope that music pumped you up because if you get pumped up, pumped up for that starting stream soon music, I'm going to sit here and play Monster Rancher.
[01:28.95]Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[01:30.41]Get, get, get, get.
[01:44.24]No.
[01:45.56]Never mind.
[01:46.96]Hey, get sad.
[02:05.79]Anybody ever done that before?
[02:08.31]I know a lot of streamers and YouTubers really pump up and pump the fuck up their streams.
[02:14.33]Has anybody made it, like, a sad music start?
[02:19.39]Or just, like, a somber beginning to the stream?
[02:29.76]Like, just, like, hanging out, instead of every stream of being, like, pumping up music, every stream starts really, really, like, slow, and they, like, air the grievances in the beginning of every stream.
[03:04.96]But in all actuality... Let me turn this down.
[03:07.18]Yeah, we're gonna do Monster Rancher again.
[03:10.08]Monster Rancher 4, we're gonna close...
[03:13.54]the series here, probably, with Monster Rancher 4.
[03:17.43]Unless I decide I'm gonna play the DS ones, because the DS ones apparently are really good too.
[03:23.37]It's just a question of capping the DS, which I know you need to mod it.
[03:29.32]So, this will probably be the last Monster Rancher 4 stream.
[03:34.02]I'm really close to A and S rank with one of the monsters, and we have a dream team now.
[03:43.94]So, we're going to probably close it up today.
[03:47.02]Tomorrow, we're going to do Risk of Rain.
[03:49.37]Etalyx wanted to swap the days we were talking about it downstairs.
[03:54.61]We were saying, yeah, we'll just do it on Friday.
[03:56.57]So, we'll do that tomorrow.
[03:58.69]And then the day after that is the Sekiro gambling stream.
[04:03.60]But welcome, though.
[04:04.34]I didn't even say hello.
[04:06.22]Didn't even introduce the stream at all.
[04:13.96]I just kind of turned on the music and forgot.
[04:18.78]Online game... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[04:20.50]There's a preface to this.
[04:23.34]There's a reason for this.
[04:28.20]I painted you a crying face.
[04:30.48]It's something else, that's for sure.
[04:35.38]I'm going to skip the music.
[04:36.20]I'm sorry.
[04:37.59]It's kind of... It's speech jamming me.
[04:42.15]But, uh, let's turn this off so you can see the screen.
[04:47.39]Push this forward.
[04:52.13]But, I'm ready to go.
[04:53.44]We're exactly where we left off.
[04:56.34]We had the five monsters.
[04:58.62]And I don't really know what to do with them.
[05:01.92]I know that four of them are going to be useless.
[05:07.95]Hold on, let me see this before we get started.
[05:14.28]My god.
[05:19.20]Look at this.
[05:24.92]I gotta put this on screen, this is fucking insane.
[05:35.65]No, the music- I don't wanna hear the music for this.
[05:38.43]This is what I'm talking about!
[05:39.45]It's not supposed to be like this.
[05:49.94]Look at this happy music.
[06:06.41]Thank you Yanwen, that's fucking amazing.
[06:16.40]If you're just joining us, yes, that is on the screen.
[06:20.79]There's a lot of emotions going on right now that I can't really describe to you.
[06:23.36]Alright, let's go.
[06:35.52]Another amazing piece of artwork from Yanwen.
[06:40.86]Yeah, at least one or two, probably like three of those are gonna be emotes.
[06:49.47]I mean, just have, like, three different versions of, like, the crying face.
[06:52.85]One of them really zoomed in.
[06:53.98]It'll be, like, Jermicry... Jermicry 2, Jermicry 3, or so.
[07:08.87]Jermicry Z for, like, zoom in.
[07:14.31]Hello, everyone.
[07:14.71]I did several chores today.
[07:15.77]Hope your rooms are clean.
[07:18.22]Thanks for reminding me.
[07:19.20]I probably should do that.
[07:24.19]Next time on Jerma Cry Z. Jerma, my boy.
[07:29.92]Yeah, that could be another one.
[07:33.83]But, so, if you haven't seen the last few, or last two Monster Rancher 4 streams, we've ended up with this team of five.
[07:43.76]The Unprover, Spyroid, Roberto, who's our main, these are just fucking smurfs, the rest are just alts, Blossom, and Adrock Plus.
[07:58.69]Those are...
[08:01.78]You can tell, yeah, you can tell who the main character is here.
[08:05.78]It actually is kind of funny.
[08:08.18]Because even if I didn't say anything... This is just the cast of an anime.
[08:14.73]It is.
[08:19.51]Okay, so you've got main character who's on a mission.
[08:23.61]This is the one that matters.
[08:24.69]This is the character that matters.
[08:26.91]Menacing...
[08:29.02]A little bit has a kind of a dark past.
[08:31.62]Really powerful, really strong.
[08:35.16]This is the huge guy.
[08:37.36]There's always a huge guy in anime that has a deep, booming voice.
[08:43.16]It's pretty arbitrary to the story, but ends up jumping in and hitting somebody with a big punch every couple episodes.
[08:50.01]Here's Comic Relief.
[08:52.27]Comic Relief, goofy, weird guy.
[08:53.61]He has a voice like this!
[08:58.58]Has sage-like advice.
[09:01.86]But is strange beyond measure.
[09:06.72]A cute, weird, stuffed animal that pops up out of somebody's pocket or out of their purse or something.
[09:18.05]Makes a couple of noises.
[09:23.59]Is what is the main selling point at Hot Topic.
[09:31.59]Make the noise?
[09:32.97]I'll try.
[09:33.37]I think I'm pretty close.
[09:43.55]Uh, then you got... Rival.
[09:47.57]You've got best friend Rival.
[09:51.64]But not really as intimidating or cool as main character.
[09:57.55]and ends up getting shown up all the time in almost every other episode, and can't stand it, and eventually it turns evil.
[10:04.35]Because of it.
[10:08.79]We got the whole team here.
[10:10.19]We got the whole anime show.
[10:11.13]You don't even need to watch the show, I just described the whole thing to you.
[10:18.46]He has to die at some point.
[10:19.52]Yeah, this character's gonna die.
[10:25.22]I like it.
[10:25.78]It's a pretty good team.
[10:28.44]It'll take eight seasons.
[10:33.22]Yeah, I like huge guy.
[10:34.61]Let's take a look at his schedules.
[10:40.45]I haven't read the manga.
[10:43.44]You're reading it right now.
[10:49.26]Huge guy is best guy.
[10:51.56]And huge guy also, here's the thing about huge guy, that maybe some of you guys that don't know about animated shows, huge guy and little funny cute thing somehow become best friends.
[11:03.37]And you did not think that was gonna happen.
[11:06.99]And in fact, eventually through the story, little cute thing stuffed animal toy will be in the pocket of this character after about four or five seasons.
[11:20.43]In fact, some people said, well, yeah, okay, well, Japanese anime.
[11:24.93]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[11:25.67]This happens in Shrek.
[11:27.91]This exact character is in Shrek, which is an American animated movie.
[11:36.02]So, it happens in American television animated movies as well.
[11:45.48]Alright, let's go.
[11:47.14]Enough of this bullshit.
[11:52.97]Donkey and... No, the dragon!
[11:54.83]Have you not seen Shrek?
[11:56.55]The giant dragon?
[11:57.41]Alright.
[12:01.79]Let me look at their stats again.
[12:02.83]I forget everything.
[12:04.83]But, hope you're having a good day.
[12:07.01]That's the intro.
[12:12.38]Okay, add raw power.
[12:14.06]What do add rocks moves?
[12:16.58]All power.
[12:18.00]Okay.
[12:20.68]Probably build power and life.
[12:24.46]This character is terrible.
[12:26.74]No wonder you're like the second-rate anime character.
[12:31.89]Alright, this is good.
[12:33.11]140, 147 is actually pretty good base.
[12:43.66]Because that's not terrible.
[12:46.37]Not terrible base accuracy, either.
[12:48.97]Can't... Nobody can step up to Roberto, though.
[12:51.45]Alright, Spyroid.
[12:53.69]Huge intelligence, right?
[12:54.83]We've been building it for a while.
[12:57.73]That speed is so bad, though.
[12:58.87]Alright, so we need... Life... Accuracy.
[13:07.08]Life... Speed.
[13:09.08]I was going full power here.
[13:14.11]And then maybe defense life for now.
[13:19.07]Defense... I don't want to... There's never a manager for the anime team.
[13:24.92]That's the thing that sucks about Monster Rancher 4.
[13:29.32]There's not somebody standing there with a notepad while they all go off on their fucking quests and missions and shit.
[13:37.57]No.
[13:38.57]They all do their own thing.
[13:44.79]I'm just gonna auto-do it for two of them.
[13:47.66]There we go.
[13:48.14]Let's get Roberto done.
[13:49.56]I want Sandbag.
[13:52.04]Yeah, what do we got?
[13:52.70]Yeah, Sandbag.
[13:54.94]He can rest the next day.
[13:55.94]Who are the two or three characters that I actually care about?
[13:59.15]Probably Spyroid.
[14:00.99]Book.
[14:02.55]And we're gonna do Speed.
[14:03.55]I really don't care about anybody else.
[14:08.51]I really don't.
[14:09.17]Like, I'm sorry I don't.
[14:10.01]Maybe... I like the weird little...
[14:12.88]dancing plush toy thing.
[14:18.97]These two actually really don't matter.
[14:20.77]I'm gonna be honest with you.
[14:21.61]Ad-Rock Plus and Unprover do not matter.
[14:29.22]How did they ever expect you to manage five fucking monsters?
[14:34.34]We're gonna end up combining them eventually.
[14:42.53]Book trampoline.
[14:43.29]Alright, let's start working on you.
[14:46.13]What did you need?
[14:47.13]The other two can just be automatic.
[14:49.21]They're just DNA bait anyways.
[14:52.15]So, intelligence B. Let's go with life defense.
[14:54.91]For now.
[15:05.74]And then you can rest, and we'll take a look after that.
[15:13.96]Oh fuck, Adrock didn't do anything.
[15:17.68]Hey, wait, was I supposed to do something?
[15:20.52]Yeah, yeah, sorry, I'm just managing fucking everybody.
[15:29.63]This is just a circus.
[15:34.81]Fuck doing tournaments, I should start charging people admission to come in here.
[15:41.93]We've got a dragon that reads books.
[15:44.93]We've got the funny dancing weightlifter.
[15:48.87]We've got the juggling act.
[15:54.85]And then... We've got the guy that kicks the sandbag.
[15:59.10]Great.
[16:00.02]And then somebody's sleeping over here.
[16:01.42]Who is he?
[16:03.98]That's kind of depressing.
[16:06.20]This is so depressing that I'm going to have to fuse you.
[16:08.14]Alright, you know what he looks like?
[16:16.82]He looks like somebody, looks like frozen dog poop.
[16:20.68]Or like dog shit that's on the sidewalk that nobody picked up after like six months.
[16:28.54]You don't, I don't know if you belong here, man.
[16:32.77]Okay, let's just go to the weekend.
[16:37.67]I'm being so mean to him.
[16:40.41]Yeah, well, that's part of his character arc.
[16:41.89]He has to prove to the group that he's stronger than the main character.
[16:46.37]And he gets close.
[16:48.97]Not quite there.
[16:49.55]Uh-oh.
[16:59.12]Roberto has become very mature.
[17:02.18]Got to adjust our raising to keep up with it.
[17:05.83]This is not good.
[17:08.07]Um...
[17:12.81]Roberto is signed up for this tournament.
[17:14.37]I gotta get Roberto to A rank.
[17:16.98]Before he dies.
[17:17.50]So if I win this one, this one... Shit.
[17:25.54]I still have to find the stupid rock for that guy.
[17:29.46]Alright, new plan.
[17:32.00]I'm sending in the troop of morons to go find the thing that the guy wants.
[17:37.79]Roberto's not going.
[17:38.73]He's just gonna rest.
[17:44.20]And this is perfect for the anime storyline, because in every anime, whenever the main character is not involved, they all fumble all over each other.
[17:54.00]They're sent on a mission and they can't fucking do it, they're all useless.
[17:58.62]And eventually they accidentally complete the mission.
[18:03.72]I can't wait to see what happens.
[18:06.23]Uh, what was it exactly that I needed?
[18:10.48]Did I already get it?
[18:11.30]I need to go explore the jungle because somebody's lost, right?
[18:14.15]That's what happened last time.
[18:23.43]Yeah, so we gotta explore the jungle with everybody but Roberto.
[18:26.83]And hope that they can come up with a victory.
[18:29.81]So let's rest.
[18:31.74]And then we got trampoline.
[18:33.34]Everyone needs to be fed, too.
[18:35.56]How do you feed five people?
[18:38.26]Rest.
[18:39.02]Tub.
[18:40.84]You don't know.
[18:41.58]Just automatic.
[18:42.30]Who cares?
[18:42.70]You're gonna die anyways.
[18:43.59]Okay.
[18:45.87]Okay.
[18:52.25]Pretty terrible gains, but that's okay.
[18:57.57]Oh, we gotta see the cutest thing in the world.
[18:59.26]Where is it?
[19:01.62]Where is it?
[19:04.84]Where is it?
[19:06.36]There you are.
[19:11.39]Oh, you're really hungry.
[19:13.45]Food.
[19:14.97]Uh, do we have... We got squid.
[19:16.67]Do you... Beef.
[19:17.57]Okay, have a squid.
[19:19.53]Beef is for very special occasions.
[19:30.88]Nah, sorry, sorry, beef is only for main characters.
[19:33.44]Alright, here, have a, uh, have a banana.
[19:47.39]What?
[19:47.73]You don't think that's a pretty good rule that beef should be only for main characters?
[19:52.05]You want me to give this side storyline art character the $300 piece of food?
[19:59.39]What are you like?
[20:02.87]Have a mango.
[20:03.25]Alright, I'm keeping you around.
[20:13.15]This character is going to stay around for a long time.
[20:15.15]I'm not getting rid of this one.
[20:24.04]We can replace the character.
[20:25.20]This can be comic relief and cute thing that pops out of somebody's purse.
[20:33.62]And every time it shows up, the screen goes different, like, colors behind them.
[20:38.40]And, like, bubbles are on the screen and shit.
[20:48.37]Oh, you're good.
[20:48.79]And it makes a weird squishy noise.
[20:54.71]You've already heard me do it.
[20:55.43]I don't have to do it twice.
[20:56.19]Alright, everyone's fine.
[20:56.92]Let's go.
[21:01.74]He keeps getting hit in the head.
[21:03.10]Alright, jungle.
[21:07.00]Select the troop.
[21:07.80]Let's go.
[21:08.36]No Roberto.
[21:10.08]I don't want... Should I... I feel like I'm going to run into a boss and this is going to be a waste of time.
[21:24.34]What do you mean, no?
[21:28.06]I can only take three?
[21:35.21]Okay, well then we're gonna... Try to leave Spyroid here, but I need to level up.
[21:48.80]No, Unprover, Blossom, and Spyroid.
[21:55.12]No, this will be good.
[21:55.94]We'll get, like, the two or three frames of animation of Unprover.
[21:59.37]No!
[21:59.89]No!
[22:00.29]No!
[22:00.43]That's so scary!
[22:01.33]Going in from behind Spyroid, out from behind, and, like, looking and peeking with the sweat coming off his head would be perfect.
[22:25.57]Okay, so we need to find the people that are here.
[22:28.37]Somebody's lost here.
[22:32.65]It even makes the right noise, too.
[22:35.32]That's the same noise it makes.
[22:36.90]Why do I know all these tropes?
[22:56.13]I don't know.
[22:56.51]Because I've seen... It doesn't take more than seeing, like, one or two episodes of an anime to know these tropes.
[23:05.81]You don't have to be, like, a seasoned anime veteran to know these things.
[23:10.93]This happens in, like, 85% of every episode.
[23:14.07]Alright, come on, do something here.
[23:21.64]Machine gun.
[23:24.78]Alright, you know, bring in the real character, please.
[23:35.85]Not bad.
[23:36.73]Alright.
[23:37.07]Alright, so now I have the ability to do, like, a team-up, right?
[23:43.26]What was it, square?
[23:46.68]Was it circle?
[23:48.94]What was the button?
[23:50.10]To have somebody jump in from the other side.
[23:56.63]Oh, there it is.
[23:57.51]Okay, it's X. That was just the anime.
[24:06.14]That was the... Oh, that's perfect.
[24:08.90]Do I need to explain that?
[24:10.68]Oh, you know what happened.
[24:12.22]Big character did all the work.
[24:14.84]Little, funny, plush toy character jumps out at the end, gets the last hit, and goes like, Yeah!
[24:20.28]You take that!
[24:23.63]Oh, it's perfect.
[24:38.37]Maybe we'll flex.
[24:40.61]And when they flex, there's a goofy, boom, big explosion of like muscles, but they're not real.
[24:46.38]It's just a cute thing with muscles, like big muscles that show when they inflate for a second.
[24:53.36]And then after holding that pose for more than a couple seconds, it's like the air comes out of them and a big sweat mark comes on the head.
[25:13.89]How the fuck is he level 8?
[25:17.47]I feel like he hasn't done anything.
[25:36.64]We get it.
[25:37.21]Yes, we get it.
[25:37.85]You watch anime.
[25:40.11]I really don't, though.
[25:42.21]I do.
[25:44.21]Not that often, but I do.
[25:48.65]Maybe like twice.
[25:50.63]I've seen at least two of them.
[25:55.44]I work at an animation studio.
[25:56.58]I'd like to hire you.
[25:58.20]Me?
[25:59.02]You'd like to hire me?
[26:01.08]I'm not so sure about that.
[26:04.82]But what if I don't do my job well?
[26:10.06]I guess I could try.
[26:17.05]And fired.
[26:23.87]That's right, you are in charge of everybody on the team.
[26:29.09]Okay everybody, finally everybody has to listen to me.
[26:33.63]Line up everyone.
[26:34.41]And then they just like fucking stampede over him.
[26:39.44]He still doesn't have any power, he thought he did.
[26:51.31]Now let's try... What's this?
[27:00.92]Do it!
[27:01.22]Come on!
[27:03.46]I love somebody's rights.
[27:04.80]Can you stop this?
[27:05.90]I don't know if I have an... I don't know if I can turn it off.
[27:17.93]Wow, that's amazing.
[27:20.07]Was that a cake?
[27:26.10]Okay, Blossom, what do you got?
[27:28.96]Hyper Beam.
[27:31.94]Head Attack.
[27:32.70]I want to see your run.
[27:40.83]I love it.
[27:46.59]Well, nobody can do it.
[27:47.27]Oh, wait, what was it?
[27:47.81]Let me take a look.
[27:51.83]Head Attack.
[27:54.48]That's exactly what that image should look like.
[27:58.57]Very high accuracy rating.
[28:04.15]Not very much life, but good crit and good accuracy.
[28:06.97]And it doesn't take very much guts.
[28:14.66]This thing is amazing.
[28:15.66]If you start off with this every time, you could just drain them.
[28:20.54]Oh, wait, wait, that wasn't... I got something else too, didn't I?
[28:25.40]Hyper beam.
[28:28.44]Beams.
[28:29.46]Apparently, eventually, I'm gonna get a beam.
[28:46.69]Bees?
[28:47.11]No beam.
[28:49.34]B-E-A-M.
[28:55.76]Mm-mm.
[28:57.58]Mm-mm.
[28:59.52]B-E-A-M.
[29:01.78]M as in Michael.
[29:05.82]You guys ever get on the phone with somebody that does that for every other word, and you're kind of just like, you don't need to do that.
[29:16.74]Yeah, you coming to the party?
[29:17.96]Yeah, yeah, I'm coming to the party.
[29:19.58]You got the address, right?
[29:21.22]Yeah, I think so.
[29:21.64]I think I got it.
[29:22.10]What was it?
[29:22.48]One, uh, what was it?
[29:23.33]Just tell me one more time.
[29:24.96]Oh, it was, uh, it was, uh, 484.
[29:27.48]Yeah, 484, okay.
[29:29.44]West, uh, W as in, as in, as in West.
[29:32.22]E as in egg.
[29:34.08]A as in apple.
[29:34.89]It's like, I know, dude, you said West.
[29:36.93]I know what you said.
[29:46.99]Come on, what?
[29:51.62]Come on, don't get knocked out here.
[29:53.88]Alright, I had to pull it back.
[29:59.10]Nice.
[30:12.53]A. Why was it W-E-A?
[30:16.72]Guy was even spelling it wrong.
[30:28.48]We... West... Yeah, if you're gonna do that you at least give me the right... spelling.
[30:43.35]A as in Ayaya?
[30:48.42]What?
[30:59.39]Nobody can help me do that.
[31:06.12]Why did you say that?
[31:06.84]What did I say?
[31:07.48]I said somebody wrote... I don't know what that even... Oh, that's the... Okay, never mind.
[31:11.32]I don't know what that is.
[31:18.00]I know what that is.
[31:25.14]Sure, I approve it.
[31:26.42]I'm not going to approve that.
[31:30.45]I know what it is.
[31:43.34]What is it then?
[31:46.52]It's the... It's the emote.
[32:01.16]It's like an emote on Twitch.
[32:08.54]Hit it!
[32:08.78]Alright, I gotta play you out.
[32:15.15]Well, you see, in the classroom, there is, uh, the girl's name is Ayayo, right?
[32:19.44]And then, uh, what happens is she doesn't understand her.
[32:22.04]She thought she was saying Ayaya.
[32:23.58]So she ends up screaming, Ayaya, like, that's your name.
[32:25.70]She's going around the room pointing at people's names and giving them their names when they tell her.
[32:30.22]But she's confused with Ayayo because she doesn't understand that one.
[32:32.75]And they keep going back and forth about Ayayo or Ayaya.
[32:37.13]And then, um, you end up watching, like, a 15-hour version of it on YouTube.
[32:57.29]I know what it fucking is.
[33:10.24]He looked it up, like, right now?
[33:11.84]Like, yeah, while I'm doing inputs and sitting here right now, did you hear a keyboard press?
[33:27.89]No, it's called, it's called like a few months ago.
[33:30.83]I have no idea what the fuck that was.
[33:34.79]And I was, I saw it everywhere and I saw references to it and I'm like, I don't know what this is.
[33:39.12]So I searched it and I read about it.
[33:42.58]And now I know the whole entire story.
[33:45.76]It's called informing yourself and seeing the facts presented in front of you and knowing what it is.
[34:07.73]Oh, funny glasses!
[34:10.29]Can you give those to me?
[34:11.49]I like those.
[34:12.21]Bro, they're fat.
[34:24.07]Fat.
[34:36.78]Funny glasses distract me.
[34:38.30]What was that?
[34:41.40]What did I just pick up?
[34:50.94]I can't go into data on my data?
[34:52.87]No.
[35:01.87]I did get distracted, you're right.
[35:06.05]It worked.
[35:12.06]Somebody wrote, I didn't even know what that meant.
[35:14.58]And he does.
[35:15.56]Why?
[35:17.84]It's because I typed it in and I looked up what it meant because I didn't know because I saw it everywhere.
[35:31.69]Guys, I've done the same thing with other emotes on Twitch that I didn't understand.
[35:37.34]Like, sour please.
[35:38.30]I kept seeing it.
[35:38.88]I didn't know what it was.
[35:39.50]And I'm like, what the fuck is this?
[35:42.00]It's a guy, like, dancing in Walmart.
[35:44.42]And I looked it up.
[35:44.94]It was a video of a guy dancing in Walmart.
[36:00.63]Oh, come on.
[36:04.36]How much gust damage does this deal?
[36:08.15]That does 29 guts damage.
[36:09.84]That's pretty good damage, actually.
[36:11.16]What about, let's try that, no, bring, come back out here.
[36:12.84]Let's try the headbutt.
[36:17.10]I mean, that's, that's the cutest thing ever.
[36:22.14]Not bad damage either for it being a shitty move.
[36:25.72]With no power levels up.
[36:33.39]Nice counter.
[36:34.51]Stupid.
[36:42.24]It's the eye from Monster Rancher 1.
[36:44.98]Dude, what?
[36:46.76]What a fucking Easter egg.
[36:51.84]Hard head.
[36:52.34]And mastered kitty punch.
[37:03.30]Look at this.
[37:06.35]Kitty punch.
[37:08.43]Apparently it does a lot of damage.
[37:15.31]It's only 10 guts to do this?
[37:18.93]Oh, it's terrible accurate.
[37:21.40]The accuracy is awful.
[37:24.28]I don't know, man.
[37:26.64]You build accuracy with this character and just spam this move over and over again.
[37:36.15]And hard head is moves that use your head.
[37:51.18]What is the most useless body part?
[37:54.58]I mean, that's kind of a weird question.
[38:03.40]Okay, you just said body part, and I see lungs on the screen here.
[38:08.96]Lungs are very important, but that's a pair of lungs.
[38:11.77]You just said body part, and that's my brain.
[38:13.09]Just turn that into a pair of lungs.
[38:16.41]What's the most useless body part?
[38:17.59]Okay, let's think about this.
[38:22.84]Uh... I mean, yeah, like, your Appendix doesn't do anything.
[38:35.95]Battle cards... Your Appendix doesn't do anything...
[38:48.26]Your nails?
[38:49.94]Yeah, like your toenails.
[38:52.50]You know that there's a theory that we're going to evolve off our fingernails and toenails, right?
[38:58.29]Over a million years if humans are still around.
[39:00.63]You're going to evolve off no fingernails.
[39:06.19]Oh, this again.
[39:06.97]I've talked about this before.
[39:08.13]No, look it up.
[39:13.25]I'm serious.
[39:13.77]Look it up.
[39:16.68]Hey, you know the thing that I did called this facts and knowledge and data from like the Institute of Technology?
[39:39.19]Which Institute of Technology?
[39:40.77]That's easy.
[39:46.82]The reblog from my grandmother's Facebook.
[39:51.70]It says it on the bottom right.
[39:54.29]Institute of Technology.
[39:58.81]It has to be real.
[40:13.68]Which Institute of Technology?
[40:16.19]The Institute of Technology.
[40:26.58]Flight Ride?
[40:28.42]Grave Throw.
[40:42.68]Alright, Flight Ride.
[40:45.16]Let's you ride your monster and fly over obstacles.
[40:47.60]Oh, okay, I can finally do that now.
[40:49.58]So I can cross the gaps there.
[40:52.63]And what is this?
[40:55.09]D by Grave Throw.
[40:57.17]Look at that.
[40:58.45]S life damage.
[41:02.10]Not bad accuracy either.
[41:03.08]Alright, which one of these sucks?
[41:09.69]So this is short range.
[41:11.55]So fire is good.
[41:13.66]Flutter is mid.
[41:14.54]So this is deep bite.
[41:15.46]Life A. Life S. Guts 23, 30.
[41:19.18]Not a big difference in guts.
[41:23.32]A. This is just a better move.
[41:25.26]It takes more guts, but it's just a better move.
[41:27.22]It'll land more often in general.
[41:30.43]There's no... Yeah, let's replace this one.
[41:44.20]He's an intelligence monster?
[41:46.26]Yeah, but some of those moves are good to have.
[41:48.80]If you run into somebody that has... You run into somebody that has high intelligence, those moves are not going to work.
[42:09.79]Can I fly over that?
[42:11.53]Hold on.
[42:17.23]Can you fly this?
[42:21.65]I can't, like, just fly over that, huh?
[42:40.18]Holy... my god.
[42:45.61]That did a lot of damage.
[42:46.47]That was a nice crit, though.
[42:47.35]Alright, bring it up.
[42:49.03]Fire in the middle.
[42:50.87]Blast him.
[42:54.19]Nice.
[43:03.32]Jeremiah, I bite my own fingers.
[43:04.42]Was that cannibalism?
[43:09.46]I don't know.
[43:09.78]That's a different... That's a topic that I don't know if we can even touch on right now because that's... It depends on who you ask.
[43:18.37]Is it auto-cannibalism if I bite my fingernails?
[43:23.25]No, because you're not... You're not biting your fingernails and eating your fingernails for sustenance.
[43:28.69]It's just... It's a habit.
[43:29.79]I'm asking you, okay?
[43:31.44]No, I don't think that's cannibalism.
[43:32.58]That's not auto-cannibalism.
[43:33.76]You're not eating your fingernails for nutrients.
[43:42.01]What if I am, though?
[43:42.91]Well, then, I really hate to tell you this, but you've been doing that really wrong, because there's no nutritional value in your fingernail.
[43:49.87]I don't think there's even calories in your fingernail.
[43:56.87]It's like eating wood.
[44:05.78]Damn it.
[44:08.30]Holy shit, that hurt.
[44:12.74]Alright, pull him out, pull him out.
[44:14.12]I don't want him to get hurt here.
[44:18.58]Nice blossom.
[44:23.81]Try it again.
[44:28.87]Come on, hit it!
[44:29.89]Just try to get it, just try to hit it!
[44:31.53]Oh my goodness, not good.
[44:38.69]Damn.
[44:41.81]Now he's got this stupid thing.
[44:43.13]16% chance to hit this.
[44:51.98]No!
[44:55.38]Oh, come on.
[44:56.88]What the fuck?
[44:57.76]What is this guy?
[44:58.76]Seriously.
[45:02.28]He's blocking every attack.
[45:03.58]They're gonna all die.
[45:08.29]Because nobody will do a fucking move.
[45:10.13]Look at this.
[45:11.21]And he blocks every attack.
[45:15.29]Oh my god.
[45:16.23]Give me a break.
[45:31.96]He's dead.
[45:33.10]This guy's unstoppable.
[45:34.32]I cannot fight this guy.
[45:38.48]Okay, well, uh, he didn't, he, he, now he comes back again.
[45:41.24]Of course it is.
[45:41.72]Great.
[45:41.94]This is fantastic.
[45:43.63]And now he's bullish.
[45:44.47]He's gonna die here.
[45:46.91]Wow, what a, what a fun game this is.
[45:50.11]What a great mechanic we have here.
[45:51.99]This is fantastic.
[45:52.85]Are you serious?
[46:02.68]Like, I blocked almost every attack.
[46:06.43]60 to 70% of every move I tried to do, they wouldn't do.
[46:10.65]And he got final guts.
[46:14.13]I got fucking party wiped.
[46:15.77]Right, yeah.
[46:16.61]What the hell was that?
[46:18.01]Genuinely angry?
[46:19.40]What the fuck was that?
[46:20.40]I got literally wiped.
[46:39.65]They're all- I just took the lifespan out of everybody here down because one alligator decided to block every single move.
[47:05.19]That's such- That's such a horse shit.
[47:10.99]Is that even, uh, what, like, come, oh, I'm so annoyed by that.
[47:14.38]Like, that's all, that's all, uh.
[47:18.84]Combine them.
[47:19.52]No, that was, things were going fine.
[47:21.42]Ding block, ding block, ding block, ding block, ding block.
[47:26.52]Oh, you're bullish, you're bullish, you're bullish.
[47:28.18]You're timid, you're timid, you're timid, you're timid, you're timid.
[47:31.25]Ouch, ouch, ouch.
[47:32.73]Ding block, ding block, ding block.
[47:34.39]Ouch, ouch, ouch.
[47:35.43]Oh, you killed me.
[47:36.09]No, I'm back.
[47:50.39]Final guts.
[47:59.84]This game is for children.
[48:01.16]Imagine being a child and having that happen to you and crying.
[48:04.14]And like going into your parents' room with the disk and the case.
[48:08.22]And being like, Mom.
[48:11.59]Can we go back to the store?
[48:15.27]What is it?
[48:15.61]What is it?
[48:15.99]What happened?
[48:16.55]This game's not fair.
[48:20.99]Of course, get in the car!
[48:25.72]Which one do you want instead?
[48:27.54]That one!
[48:29.06]And you point really hard at the box, and it's Super Mario Party for N64, and that's the game you should have bought.
[48:55.94]That's so funny.
[48:57.96]Are you sure?
[48:58.52]Yeah!
[48:59.08]And he beats everything first try.
[49:04.33]He fucking perfect deflects every single enemy.
[49:09.93]He's the one on Reddit that's telling you that you quit crying about how hard the game is.
[49:14.90]It's not hard.
[49:15.62]It's easy.
[49:16.20]I beat him.
[49:28.54]Anyways.
[49:36.24]Jack's origin story.
[49:38.98]You're like, man, this is so fucking hard.
[49:40.28]I haven't got any tips.
[49:41.10]Like, I've died like a hundred times to the ogre.
[49:43.34]This is like fucking really hard.
[49:48.35]Just dodge right.
[49:50.51]Slash.
[49:56.10]You're not intelligent.
[50:04.55]Not intelligent.
[50:07.35]I'm so fucking mad right now.
[50:08.97]I can't believe it.
[50:09.67]I don't want to do that again.
[50:10.63]I don't want to bring... I'm going to have to bring Roberto in there.
[50:22.27]Can I save scum?
[50:23.11]No, no, no.
[50:23.72]That's not necessary.
[50:28.92]Go get your ass handed to you again.
[50:30.12]And I was reading stuff about, um... There are people saying that to add, like, an easy mode to Sekiro.
[50:42.16]That's, like, a current topic right now.
[50:53.94]Did this happen when, like, Bloodborne came out?
[50:57.14]Or Dark Souls 3?
[50:57.82]When Dark Souls 3 came out, was there, like, a... No, but there wasn't a reason for it, because you could just overlevel.
[51:07.37]That's true.
[51:07.89]This is, like, the first time, really, this has probably ever happened.
[51:10.97]Cuphead?
[51:11.29]Yeah, but Cuphead had, like, a casual mode, didn't it?
[51:13.33]Where you could play, like, on easy?
[51:17.23]It did still happen.
[51:22.56]I'm of the opinion that, like... Okay, if I go into an art gallery, and there's a picture of, like, the Scream, right?
[51:33.23]And I look at the Scream, and I'm like, huh.
[51:35.83]The Scream, that's... Who made that?
[51:38.73]Oh, Leonardo da Vinci.
[51:40.73]Oh, okay.
[51:42.29]Do you mind... You pull up, you rip a fucking Sharpie off, and you're like, do you mind if I go in here for a second?
[51:48.27]What are you doing?
[51:48.87]What are you doing?
[51:49.27]And you're like...
[51:51.87]And you add, like, a row of teeth on the screen.
[51:55.94]It's a church!
[51:56.38]What the fuck are you doing?
[51:57.42]And, like, everyone's gonna, like, tackle you and, like, rip you out of there.
[52:07.61]I must have... What?
[52:09.97]The screen is by Edward... I know, I know.
[52:12.39]I got it wrong.
[52:12.85]I just said any painter.
[52:19.27]teeth in easy mode.
[52:22.23]No, I'm just saying it's like, uh, making like an easy mode after the fact, I think is not, it wouldn't work.
[52:34.92]If from the very beginning they decided to do something like that, then I think that would make some sense, right?
[52:39.80]But if the game's already out and they retroactively go back and have to change everything, you know what I mean?
[52:49.33]There are a lot of games that are made from the ground up with, like, that in mind, and that's... that's great.
[52:54.77]If Sekiro had in, like, an easy mode, at launch, it's like, okay, so they wanted to do this, they wanted to have it like that, that's fine.
[53:05.09]But if it's already done, and it wasn't, like, part of the plan, then... Did somebody just give 20 fucking community subs?
[53:13.54]Uh, GreatLordWald, and thanks for the 20 community subs, holy shit.
[53:20.58]Thank you.
[53:21.88]For the 20 fucking subs.
[53:25.88]That's, uh, a lot.
[53:33.79]Thank you.
[53:40.22]But yeah, I mean, I totally understand the aspect of...
[53:44.78]Like, I want to enjoy the game too, right?
[53:46.88]And I don't want to grind Isshin for 17 hours, right?
[53:53.40]I completely understand it.
[53:54.24]But I think something like that should be, like, tied into how the game is developed in the first place.
[54:10.11]Because that shit is fucking hard.
[54:11.07]That game is hard, hard, hard.
[54:12.59]Like, very fucking hard.
[54:13.59]Those of you that watch those streams, holy shit.
[54:16.88]That's one of the hardest things I've ever done.
[54:17.94]Okay, life.
[54:36.15]Alright, everybody needs to rest because of that shit.
[54:38.73]Only Roberto can do anything.
[54:44.11]You fought the headless guy and had a psychotic breakdown.
[54:46.99]Yeah, I know.
[54:47.75]That's what I'm saying.
[54:48.37]Like, it's... I understand, like, what people are talking about when they say, like, holy shit, this game is fucking next level.
[55:03.46]But, in my opinion, I think decisions like that need to be made right at the beginning.
[55:13.75]Alright, everyone needs to eat.
[55:14.59]How about, uh, you like bananas.
[55:37.90]Wait, what, are we talking about a Jerm of opinion here?
[55:45.61]But also, like, look, think about this, too.
[55:48.23]And I know that some people are gonna, like, I've given my opinion and my stance on that, right?
[55:51.89]How I think, like, retroactively adding modes to games that are not baked into the artistic vision of the creator, right, I think should be done differently.
[56:02.82]But... The person that wants to enjoy Sekiro, they still paid for the product, right?
[56:10.85]They still paid for it.
[56:12.37]And sometimes it can be difficult for...
[56:15.97]You think about that, like, oh, like, imagine you get, like, ah, yeah, I got, like, two kids.
[56:20.29]I gotta go to work and come back.
[56:21.82]I got, like, 45 minutes today to play Sekiro.
[56:24.42]And you're just at the ogre for four days straight.
[56:26.44]You know what I mean?
[56:30.32]Some people just want to, like, enjoy the experience.
[56:32.50]And that's, like, a whole nother... That's a whole nother opinion there.
[56:40.46]You could just play another game.
[56:41.62]Yeah, but they still bought it.
[56:43.94]And they still want to like it, right?
[56:51.29]Somebody says, having one difficulty means you can balance the game specifically for it.
[56:55.92]Yeah.
[56:59.78]But if you have modes, like, I mean, like Devil May Cry, right, has like a bunch of hard and easy modes.
[57:05.10]Cuphead is one of the hardest games that came out, like, last year, and that had modes too, and it wasn't like, holy shit, why are these in here?
[57:12.87]But it was baked into the game.
[57:14.95]They, like, planned for that.
[57:16.39]They were making that that way.
[57:29.64]Yeah, there's no need to be rude to each other.
[57:32.20]We can have a very decent conversation with each other.
[57:40.19]Sometimes we talk about these things.
[57:41.27]We don't have to be angry or mean with each other.
[57:42.81]Come on, guys.
[57:47.85]I just beat Sekiro last week, and I see a lot of people talking about it, so I figured, hey, why don't we talk about it for a second?
[57:56.50]It's interesting.
[58:08.26]He's flexing on it.
[58:09.48]I mean, I did just beat Sekiro last week.
[58:11.28]Okay, everyone's okay.
[58:16.20]Alright, let's do some training.
[58:17.64]Wait, no, no, no.
[58:18.18]When's the tournament?
[58:23.37]It's today.
[58:23.79]Alright, don't train.
[58:30.93]No, actually, you can train today.
[58:33.78]You'll be fine.
[58:37.55]Alright, what about everybody else?
[58:38.49]You need to do... Look at how fucked up they all still are.
[58:41.82]Just rest.
[58:46.65]You're the only one that can even do anything.
[59:09.92]Okay, let's give you some good food.
[59:12.34]Uh, that's not good food.
[59:20.76]I was just gonna give you a potato.
[59:23.32]Alright, Roberto is, somebody said Roberto's gonna die.
[59:39.42]He's not gonna die yet.
[59:40.44]He'll be okay.
[59:41.78]For, like, another couple tournaments.
[59:45.10]How much time does he have left?
[59:48.32]What do rocks like to eat?
[59:52.32]He can have a potato.
[59:53.68]Who cares?
[59:54.09]Yeah, but I didn't want to, like, open up, like, a can of worms with that topic.
[60:08.53]I just figured it's very, very much relevant right now.
[60:13.08]And we talk about relevant things on this channel.
[60:16.26]We don't.
[60:29.07]You're good.
[60:32.12]So you can now train tomorrow.
[60:35.72]Let's do... We need you to do, like, life.
[60:41.52]No, no, no.
[60:41.92]You need... You had high speed, high intelligence.
[60:44.41]You know what?
[60:44.69]Just fucking burn intelligence.
[60:46.99]Just do it.
[60:51.91]We got a tournament.
[60:56.62]Alright, Roberto.
[60:57.08]Let's see what you got.
[60:57.78]You're in B rank now.
[61:15.11]Alright, Roberto versus Lean.
[61:16.91]This is a dragon, I think.
[61:21.16]Look at that.
[61:21.56]296 intelligence, high defense, high power.
[61:25.18]This thing is not to be fucked around with.
[61:29.57]Nice Lean meat.
[61:48.82]Right at the bat.
[61:49.34]Perfect.
[61:51.48]It's a giant Sonic the Hedgehog.
[61:53.21]They're always gonna be Sonic the Hedgehog, no matter what.
[61:59.55]Every one of these will be Sonic.
[62:13.91]I want a statue of beanbag Sonic.
[62:19.57]Alright, we'll lean-beat... Sunday?
[62:23.11]Oh, Sunday won the last match.
[62:25.95]High power, high defense.
[62:29.41]Alright.
[62:32.11]Just gotta land moves, that's it.
[62:33.41]I'm just stacking power on Roberto.
[62:42.85]We're just going for one-hit kills.
[62:44.79]Uh-oh.
[62:46.69]Thank God.
[62:52.76]It's so hard to counter that.
[62:54.10]It's so quick.
[63:02.24]It was Energize.
[63:03.04]It was Energize.
[63:16.23]Eden, looks like you're not that threatening.
[63:20.45]No, not at all.
[63:21.59]It should be easy.
[63:28.03]Sponsored by Energizer.
[63:29.55]Not quite.
[63:39.04]Perfect.
[63:41.54]Come on, I have to get to... Give me the A rank.
[63:44.24]Nice, countered it.
[63:47.16]All I want is A rank.
[63:49.08]I don't even need to do S rank.
[63:51.20]I just want to get to A rank.
[63:54.21]Roberto has six months to a year left to live.
[63:56.84]Okay.
[63:57.94]I'll save every month.
[64:04.07]I'm gonna drink this five-year-old Pac-Man energy drink that's been on my shelf for pre- Don't do that.
[64:09.43]You're gonna insta-puke.
[64:20.60]Yeah, you will insta-puke.
[64:21.78]I watched somebody do stuff like that.
[64:24.50]And I can't recommend you do that.
[64:29.30]Peron.
[64:30.46]High power, but not that bad.
[64:32.92]Shouldn't be that much of an issue.
[64:46.42]Huge dog.
[64:49.03]Uh-oh.
[64:49.35]Let's go for a Power Slash.
[64:57.00]Oh, almost.
[64:57.92]Back it up.
[65:03.11]You missed it!
[65:06.31]Just going for a little tap damage.
[65:07.41]That's all I wanted.
[65:16.14]Somebody said that was a cursed inkling.
[65:34.59]What a very specific reference.
[65:37.37]Alright, this is the guy to beat.
[65:38.43]Life 284.
[65:39.03]So it looks like he's going to try to outlast...
[65:44.80]Even if I lose here, it's Sunday and I already beat Sunday.
[65:48.18]Just has really high health.
[65:52.46]Why am I not using more midair?
[65:54.44]I don't know.
[66:01.21]Takes too much damage.
[66:05.82]Takes too much guts.
[66:16.39]Pretty good.
[66:20.64]I am the victor of this championship tournament.
[66:29.72]Roberto wins B rank.
[66:33.21]Two more tournaments and I win and I can get to A. A rank.
[66:44.26]I got a salmon, too.
[66:45.31]Am I the most popular I can be?
[66:46.67]This is as popular as you are physically allowed to be.
[66:54.47]And a fresh salmon.
[66:56.18]He doesn't get to eat it, though, because he's gonna die.
[66:58.48]We're gonna give that to the baby.
[66:59.72]Alright, I need a friend.
[67:03.34]Whose friends?
[67:05.00]I need to look at this, because if I get six more months...
[67:13.91]Who likes each other?
[67:15.79]Roberto and Spyroid are good friends.
[67:22.38]How do I make them great friends?
[67:28.17]So we need to level up and get Spyroid up and then combine Spyroid and Roberto and then have the ultimate being.
[67:48.92]By taking them on adventures together?
[67:52.76]What if I just bring two of them?
[68:01.86]That's kind of sad.
[68:02.64]Not yet.
[68:14.98]Alright, I'm gonna bring Spyroid, Blossom, and Roberto.
[68:19.21]And Roberto's gonna steamroll while they all become friends.
[68:24.85]Let's save it here.
[68:37.12]Alright, what do we got for tournaments?
[68:41.85]Where is Spyroid?
[68:43.65]Spyroid, I need to win.
[68:44.61]I'm gonna... I have to stop ranking Spyroid up.
[68:50.49]He's the only other one I really care about, besides Blossom, but... Can I just... Can they both rank up?
[68:56.40]If they win this one?
[68:57.70]Together?
[68:58.04]$50 just came in.
[69:07.80]Shalasha?
[69:11.94]Thank you, Shalasha, for the $50, 5,000 bits.
[69:16.22]And they say, your streams are always so unique compared to other streamers, and that's something that I draw a lot of joy from.
[69:24.81]This money's chump change compared to what you deserve.
[69:28.29]Hope you can continue to bring laughs to your viewers for years to come.
[69:30.93]Thank you again.
[69:32.03]You're pretty good.
[69:36.27]Thank you for the extremely, extremely generous amount of money, Shalasha.
[69:42.61]shal a shals shal a shals the Bostonian accent shalashashka shalasha that's the shalashashka got it what did I say shalashka shalashka
[70:13.19]You ever been to Alaska before?
[70:15.45]It's the most northwestern state in the entire United States.
[70:24.01]But thank you so much, man.
[70:25.23]Really appreciate it.
[70:28.63]That's a ton of money.
[70:30.39]And don't compare yourself to what other people have given.
[70:37.22]Any amount of money is appreciated on this channel.
[70:39.00]No matter what, whatever denomination it is.
[70:47.03]Let's get, uh... Let's get Spyroid in this tournament.
[70:55.98]And then this one.
[70:56.98]We gotta just start ranking them up.
[70:58.24]Because if we're gonna fuse Spyroid... Yeah, if we're gonna... We have to just do it.
[71:04.75]We just have to blow through it.
[71:05.69]I don't like that feature.
[71:10.40]You know what I mean?
[71:11.81]I don't like the three star feature.
[71:13.31]If he's ready, he's ready.
[71:14.55]I don't... I happen to do three tournaments no matter what.
[71:17.63]Okay.
[71:30.42]Am I drinking right now?
[71:31.36]No, I'm not.
[71:33.60]Oh, I'm drinking coffee.
[71:35.02]I have a cup of coffee in front of me right now.
[71:37.75]Rest.
[71:38.30]Rest.
[71:40.22]Rest today because you have a tournament.
[71:42.62]You can actually... It's automatic for technique.
[71:49.06]You can do the book.
[71:52.15]And you... Who cares?
[71:53.93]Okay, let's go for it.
[72:04.54]Decent gain.
[72:11.89]You're good.
[72:12.45]I need food, though.
[72:14.57]I gotta go to town and get some food.
[72:28.66]Does this take the whole... No, it doesn't.
[72:31.66]Oh, fuck.
[72:35.17]I'll do it tomorrow.
[72:39.97]Hope we get acting lessons today.
[72:43.56]Step one, imagine the situation you're currently in.
[72:49.54]I really should do an acting lesson stream, an acting workshop.
[72:57.74]Damn it.
[73:01.31]I should just bring in actors into the studio and do an acting workshop on stream.
[73:16.02]Hmm... We'll take... Maybe we'll get the Discord or the chat to vote on slides, like scripts for movies to do.
[73:27.89]Huh.
[73:35.72]I like this idea actually a lot.
[73:41.16]And then at the end...
[73:43.99]This takes a little more planning, but at the end, maybe chat holds up like a sign of like between 0 and 10?
[73:52.09]Like the Olympics, but it's like the acting Olympics?
[73:55.32]Why don't they do that?
[74:01.20]How come there's no acting Olympics?
[74:04.10]I guess that it's just the Academy Awards, but... Because that's mean.
[74:19.94]The acting Olympics.
[74:22.23]You give them different scenarios that they have to do on the fly.
[74:24.99]They have like an hour to prepare for the scene.
[74:33.12]Because it's so subjective.
[74:36.82]We see why I think they shouldn't add an easy mode.
[74:42.72]Alright, two huge animals versus each other.
[74:54.62]Look at this one.
[74:57.64]Holy shit.
[74:59.04]Best character ever!
[75:00.26]BEST CHARACTER EVER!
[75:01.12]Now, we just have to do that two more times before you can get to D. Fries.
[75:21.36]A potato.
[75:30.60]Jeremy, have you ever heard that some animals can see colors that humans can't?
[75:33.80]You ever wonder what those colors could be?
[75:40.08]No, I have no concept of what that could be.
[75:47.45]You know?
[75:47.91]There's no concept of what that possibly is.
[75:54.78]Yeah, like infrared, maybe?
[75:56.84]Or...
[75:58.83]Anytime I think of a color that, I don't know why this is, but whenever I can't think of a color that humans can perceive, I always just think of the prism.
[76:10.01]The prism color, you know what I mean?
[76:14.66]It's because movies have done that.
[76:18.94]It's a color that humans can't see.
[76:20.78]And there it is on the screen, and it's like a reflecting prism color.
[76:38.48]Okay, you get another one tomorrow.
[76:39.94]Life Blade.
[76:41.54]How are you?
[76:42.30]You're okay.
[76:42.72]Rest today.
[76:43.52]And eat.
[76:43.99]I gotta eat.
[76:49.49]Bingo.
[76:49.91]Right here.
[76:50.79]Another competition is scheduled for that.
[76:52.31]Yes, we're doing this one instead.
[76:53.70]God damn it.
[76:55.02]Why can't I do more than one?
[76:57.44]Sloppy.
[76:58.34]Sloppy game design.
[76:59.78]Sloppy game.
[77:01.26]Sloppy.
[77:11.75]Can only do one tournament.
[77:13.81]How am I supposed to manage five fucking monsters?
[77:16.30]If I can only do one tournament.
[77:21.20]I can't- I gotta hire somebody to do the other one.
[77:26.97]Alright.
[77:27.71]Schedule.
[77:28.57]We've got tomorrow.
[77:30.35]We've got a rest.
[77:31.47]We've got... What do you know- No, no, no, no, no, no.
[77:33.85]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[77:34.95]Power, right?
[77:36.35]Yeah.
[77:37.37]Yeah.
[77:37.65]Power and health.
[77:39.76]Power and accuracy.
[77:42.67]Straight up power.
[77:48.70]Everybody else, you can go fuck off.
[77:53.30]I'm just kidding.
[77:55.97]Rest.
[77:57.73]Sandbag.
[77:59.29]You can do something.
[78:06.66]And you're on automatic anyways.
[78:19.45]Plus 14 power.
[78:20.35]Almost a little 20 power.
[78:21.39]Alright, you're good.
[78:29.28]Let's praise and give... I gotta get food.
[78:34.90]Floppy game design?
[78:36.85]Eh.
[78:44.79]No, that salmon is for whoever comes out.
[78:47.65]When I fuse the two of you.
[78:52.37]I don't have anything else to give you.
[78:53.39]Uh-oh.
[78:59.51]Huh.
[78:59.63]You're gonna have to wait till tomorrow to eat.
[79:04.24]Wait, do you have a tournament today?
[79:05.38]Ah, everyone, people are hungry.
[79:15.56]Ah, who do I give this food to?
[79:18.62]Oh, Lee!
[79:20.60]I'm so glad he took care of my kids, Lee.
[79:22.98]My son.
[79:27.53]Not so easy, is it?
[79:44.77]Well, actually, we want you to be... Okay, here we go.
[79:47.27]You get the beef.
[79:48.91]We want you to stick around for a little while.
[79:50.07]Because you gotta get to, like, at least C or B. He loved it.
[79:56.57]Alright, proceed to the weekend.
[80:02.37]Give me some... Town.
[80:06.01]Go here.
[80:06.37]Let's get some more food.
[80:19.01]Welcome, Thane.
[80:20.41]I would like to buy a lot of this.
[80:24.65]Let's get... Fuck it.
[80:25.63]Come on, man.
[80:26.11]Let's get five of them.
[80:31.37]Let's get a bunch of bananas.
[80:38.81]And... I need some more mangoes.
[80:45.07]A couple of squids.
[80:46.81]Maybe a couple of squids.
[80:52.83]And that's good.
[80:59.92]I have so much dumb shit.
[81:01.18]Look at this.
[81:02.78]Raises spirit a little during adventures.
[81:07.42]Toughness and accuracy are a little better during battle.
[81:12.78]I feel like I should just liquidate my inventory.
[81:14.82]But money doesn't seem to have too much of a purpose yet.
[81:19.46]I think it will very soon, though.
[81:33.55]You sound like Orson Welles.
[81:36.11]What?
[81:39.69]Orson Welles sounds like this.
[81:41.19]This is kind of the way that he used to talk.
[81:43.94]I don't think that I have that kind of inflection.
[81:50.18]The beginning and end of most of his words were pulled in a little.
[81:56.19]Why do I sound like that?
[82:04.03]Young Orson.
[82:04.95]No, I don't.
[82:05.39]I don't sound like Young Orson Welles.
[82:10.71]What?
[82:11.57]I've never heard that before.
[82:18.71]Okay, we got... Trampoline, that's fine.
[82:22.73]Target, that's good.
[82:24.61]Rest and food.
[82:26.41]And then your tournament.
[82:29.57]You need to rest because you're going to be very angry.
[82:33.37]And you... I don't know.
[82:35.70]Power or something.
[82:36.40]Who cares?
[82:40.14]I could go for a Mimosa.
[82:42.68]Do it up.
[82:45.10]Look how bad Adrock actually is.
[82:46.78]You sound like my cousin, Orson Welles.
[83:06.32]Alright, here we go.
[83:08.77]Let's give you a nice, delicious, scrumptious mango.
[83:15.63]You gotta be nice and nutri- nutriosized for your tournament today.
[83:24.21]And you.
[83:26.98]You're good.
[83:27.88]You.
[83:34.73]Uh, have a... Have a... Have a banana.
[83:50.24]There's also the stream... Guys, there's so many streams that I want to do this summer.
[83:55.19]I just need to get in touch with the right people.
[83:57.03]Somebody said, like, bartender.
[83:59.17]I want to just, like, throw a party where I'm the bartender.
[84:02.57]And the stream is just, I have a party in the studio.
[84:07.19]When I just invite a bunch of people and I have to make their drinks for them.
[84:13.87]And see if I can do it. ...
[84:27.50]Go get my bartender's license.
[84:30.62]And do it.
[84:31.61]You can get a bartender's license in, like, I think a weekend.
[84:36.19]Just for the stream.
[84:45.63]Just so I can invite a bunch of people.
[84:48.71]Like, streamers, YouTubers, like, friends.
[84:52.02]Just get them all here.
[85:03.22]Alright, what do you like?
[85:04.56]Okay, likes trokaten and doesn't like to play.
[85:17.81]Spyro likes to fight, doesn't like to play.
[85:22.15]Likes reference, doesn't like to sleep, right?
[85:27.34]So, Blossom likes roses and doesn't like to fight.
[85:32.01]He likes fossils and doesn't like to battle.
[85:34.00]What do you like for food though?
[85:37.88]High pride, cool, cheerful.
[85:44.59]Have a banana.
[85:50.65]Imagine having like a room with like 40, 50 people in it and I'm making drinks at everybody.
[85:56.54]And everyone would try, hey, do you think you can fucking make this one?
[86:00.84]And I do.
[86:01.70]And I can.
[86:03.78]And I'll be fucking lively and I'll be chatting up everybody.
[86:06.34]It'll be so fun.
[86:20.68]Rent out a hibachi and try to cook there.
[86:31.53]It's like, okay, you know how people do first impression for games and stuff?
[86:36.65]What if I did it?
[86:38.04]Now hear me out on this.
[86:39.46]What if I started doing first impressions on other occupations?
[86:45.34]Like occupations, chef, teacher, detective.
[87:01.30]Show like just how difficult these jobs are.
[87:08.28]Go be a pool boy.
[87:15.57]Just do like this, be a pool boy for a stream and give like my first impressions on like being a pool boy.
[87:29.79]This is just Dirty Jobs, but not Dirty Jobs.
[87:34.26]Not like Dirty Jobs.
[87:36.06]This is just Jobs.
[87:43.55]Jobs.
[87:45.63]With Jeremy Elbertson.
[88:04.12]This is why I like data.
[88:07.40]Some of these things just have to happen.
[88:11.88]I'm going to tell you something right now.
[88:12.88]I think I'm going to blow the lid off of one of these things that is coming up soon.
[88:17.90]Because I need to tell you what it is.
[88:19.46]I have to talk about it.
[88:21.14]Because you have to be ready for it.
[88:25.94]This is not, like, you need to know what this is, and I've already started talking with people and trying to get the ball rolling on it, so it's gonna, if it happens, it's gonna happen soon.
[88:34.42]This, like, if this just pops up one day, no one's gonna know what to do.
[88:38.52]It's gonna be fucking confusing.
[88:48.71]It's gonna be really confusing.
[88:49.77]If this stream just turns on, it's gonna be like, I don't even know what the fuck's happening.
[88:55.60]Remember how we talked about the detective stream before it happened?
[88:58.34]For like a week or so.
[88:59.12]A couple weeks.
[88:59.64]I mean, this is not going to happen in like a week or two.
[89:01.62]But like, I've already started the process of trying to figure out how this is actually going to work.
[89:06.74]Here you go.
[89:07.04]You ready?
[89:08.10]An upcoming stream that I'm trying to... And I've been trying to do this for a long time.
[89:11.28]Because it's just hard to do.
[89:16.61]It's not like a big deal.
[89:17.97]It's just something fun that I wanted to do.
[89:19.65]And it's going to happen probably... If it's going to happen, it's going to happen soon.
[89:22.99]Here it is.
[89:25.80]I'm going to set up a stream where I sit in a dunk tank and Twitch controls a robot pitching machine to try to dunk me while I talk shit.
[89:54.14]I think I may have talked about it once before.
[89:58.09]At the very end of a stream.
[90:04.61]But I never, not like in the middle of a stream.
[90:06.97]I think I talked about it maybe once a little bit.
[90:10.43]And that was probably a while ago.
[90:12.03]And I've been trying to figure out how to do this.
[90:13.31]And I've got somebody now.
[90:15.47]That has knowledge in this area.
[90:17.67]That can help.
[90:21.03]So.
[90:22.91]That idea.
[90:25.55]is actually probably going to happen.
[90:33.13]How does that relate to Detective?
[90:34.49]Well, it relates like this.
[90:37.67]There's gonna be like chatbots and stuff that are in the stream a day or two before and people are gonna be like, what the fuck is this?
[90:44.14]So you kinda need to know that that's a possibility.
[90:50.06]Is chat going to aim it by saying left, right?
[90:52.36]Yes.
[90:53.66]It's gonna be total chaos.
[91:02.19]You got to dunk me.
[91:09.05]And I know people saying, well, hold on a second.
[91:11.09]What if we just aim it like backwards?
[91:14.03]No, there's going to be like safety.
[91:15.69]There's going to be a safety person there.
[91:18.70]That's job is to make sure that you guys don't like aim it all the way to the left and like blow out a window.
[91:28.12]There'll be a safety individual there whose job is to make sure that it's safe.
[91:44.27]Do you guys know how a dunk tank works?
[91:47.07]There's a cage and like a little button.
[91:57.08]Fill the tank with maple syrup.
[91:58.60]No!
[92:00.78]I'm filling it with hot sauce.
[92:03.58]That's not happening either.
[92:15.60]But there was a major development on that very recently.
[92:20.32]So, there is a very high possibility that you're just gonna see that.
[92:23.24]It's just gonna happen.
[92:25.15]You'll see the fucking... Okay, when you start to see like the chatbot come into the channel... And we might do some testing too on it.
[92:34.20]To make sure it works.
[92:36.78]That's how you know it's coming.
[92:51.96]Fill it with Ecto Cooler.
[92:53.26]Uh, not- this guy's a pushover.
[93:01.24]Is it gonna be a pitching machine that chat moves?
[93:02.94]Yes.
[93:06.63]The original idea was... to have it be... a stream that you kind of got, like, lined up for and... Okay, that was insane.
[93:19.67]Like, it was somebody's turn, right?
[93:24.55]But logistically, it would be very difficult to set that up.
[93:28.00]And maybe... It depends on if I can get some... The people that I have involved, if they can give me guidance on it.
[93:36.72]So, you know, essentially maybe you pay like $5 in bits or something and you get three balls.
[93:41.90]That was like the original idea.
[93:43.16]This would all be for charity, by the way.
[93:46.49]But then I thought about that would be very, very difficult to do.
[93:50.57]Because...
[93:52.89]It would just... There could be a ton of people in that line and it might never end.
[94:05.98]There was ideas maybe to have certain people maybe get whitelisted to do it.
[94:11.68]Like another streamer or something to get a chance or make it an event.
[94:16.53]But I'm not sure yet.
[94:18.13]But I don't think that... I don't want people to pay to do it though.
[94:28.12]bidding war for five minutes highest bid after five minutes gets the ball yeah or like random draw was another thing maybe like random draw give somebody a chance to do it but the thing with random draw is if what if that person's like AFK it'd be like oh alright well we need to have a code set up where if they didn't move for x amount of seconds they would just go on to another person
[95:09.17]Have a quiz in the first place.
[95:10.95]Yeah, these are all interesting things to try.
[95:15.28]But I did want to kind of just start opening up a conversation about it.
[95:18.66]Because it's something that I really, really want to do soon.
[95:23.58]Because once the weather started to get better, there was going to be these things I wanted to try to do, and this is one of them.
[95:29.41]The ASMR stream is another one.
[95:32.37]That's still happening.
[95:34.65]I can't let that one go because of a couple of very specific things I want to do in it.
[95:46.79]Well, 260 accuracy, damn.
[96:00.92]That would break Twitch.
[96:02.72]I don't know.
[96:03.30]If it was done right, I mean, when, like, Twitch plays Pokémon was a thing.
[96:08.94]There was tens of thousands of people there.
[96:12.62]Just needs to be done right.
[96:31.82]Isn't ASMR banned from Twitch?
[96:35.78]That would be very new development if that was the case.
[96:37.72]They're the people that base their entire channels on that, right?
[96:53.44]PRGA2C.
[96:58.74]Okay.
[97:11.49]Uh, what the fuck is this?
[97:13.79]It's an actual robot thing.
[97:17.46]This is like a true bot.
[97:21.62]Terrible defense, apparently.
[97:27.90]That thing's cool.
[97:33.46]Breeding robots.
[97:34.44]Yeah, don't you just build a robot?
[97:44.25]Yeah, the reason why the dunk tank thing is something that was gonna take a while was just because programming and robotics and stuff, that takes people to know what the fuck they're doing with that certain field.
[97:58.84]And I've been throwing the line out a bunch of times actually over the course of the last like five months to see if I could find somebody that was like really knowledgeable in like the chatbot area and
[98:11.18]The only reason why I'm talking about it is because there was a very, very recent development on getting it actually started.
[98:17.28]Let's back it up and just end this.
[98:26.94]Let's make this like flashy.
[98:39.11]Would I be paying?
[98:39.83]Oh, absolutely.
[98:40.82]Yeah.
[98:46.90]I just, like, burnt all my guts.
[98:48.12]Uh-oh.
[98:51.97]Uh-oh.
[98:58.63]Alright, come on.
[99:00.45]52%.
[99:00.83]Alright, we're good.
[99:16.90]Hubris was taking over.
[99:22.62]Have you saved a single time?
[99:23.66]Yeah, I have.
[99:27.35]$5,000 and a melon.
[99:28.77]Good job, Roberto.
[99:30.63]You're too famous already.
[99:40.43]People hear that, uh, how do I contact you?
[99:43.37]Cyberjunkie helps Cuba with a lot of chatbot stuff.
[99:48.27]Talk to William Osman.
[99:49.74]He's great with electronics and would probably be happy to do it.
[99:52.10]Yeah, these are all great resources.
[99:53.62]Things to, obviously, absolutely consider.
[100:01.54]$5,000.
[100:01.56]A ResidentSleeper.
[100:02.32]A melon.
[100:03.00]PogChamp.
[100:07.31]Okay, so that's two.
[100:09.31]Can I get another one of these done before you die?
[100:13.97]Can I get up to A rank before you die?
[100:16.51]Seriously, why is this so spread out here?
[100:25.25]Okay, so we're going to do... Spyroid is already signed up for this one.
[100:28.62]And then Spyroid and Blossom are going to do this team battle one.
[100:32.12]And then Spyroid from here will be able to do... You're going to do three tournaments in a row.
[100:37.00]We'll get you rested up.
[100:37.78]Don't worry.
[100:46.43]But at the moment, I do have somebody that is very knowledgeable.
[100:51.21]That is putting me on a very good path at the moment.
[100:54.03]But...
[100:55.38]If that doesn't pan out, or if I need more resources, I absolutely will ask about it again.
[101:22.16]After the monsters reach a certain age, they cannot be raised any further, and they cannot participate in any battles.
[101:28.04]Well, that's alright, we're just gonna save- we're gonna save Scum every week.
[101:32.88]You should ask Steve Urkel.
[101:38.58]Yeah, let me ask Steve Urkel.
[101:41.86]To help with the Twitch bot dunk tank stream.
[101:46.00]Yeah.
[101:47.58]Okay.
[101:51.71]Alright!
[101:52.01]Did you ask Norman Osborn?
[102:11.59]Any more fictional characters I should be aware of?
[102:15.07]That will help me with this?
[102:25.63]Alright, let's get some training here.
[102:29.22]Alright, we got big tournaments coming up for you, so you can just... rest here.
[102:36.34]Just do the... target, if you need better.
[102:39.60]Okay, target, trampoline.
[102:42.06]Target, rest, trampoline.
[102:45.55]And then we got this one.
[102:46.57]Now you... sandbag, sandbag, go sandbag, rest, probably.
[102:54.20]Wrrrr- Rest.
[102:58.20]Tar- no somebody's already using it.
[103:00.64]Let's do uhm, let's do intelligence again. Let's stack it.
[103:06.64]And then maybe RES- we'll see. Who cares.
[103:25.64]Big gains by Roberto.
[103:33.49]Let's feed.
[103:36.97]Hey, good job.
[103:47.93]Food.
[103:50.01]Squid!
[103:54.93]You should ask my good friend, Elon Musk.
[103:59.27]He's got like a fucking trillion dollars, right?
[104:22.48]That's a pretty interesting melon.
[104:23.69]I feel like that melon... You pull that up and push that down and you're gonna blow up like the Roadrunner's... Like bridge that he's gonna cross or something.
[104:46.12]What in Sam hell are you saying?
[104:48.69]I'm saying like the Wile E. Coyote, that's the thing he uses when he lifts up and pushes down and the Roadrunner misses.
[104:54.93]Have you ever watched an anime before?
[104:59.83]What do I want to feed you?
[105:03.03]I have too many expensive items.
[105:05.31]Here, have a squid.
[105:15.72]He didn't even like that.
[105:19.91]For a second I thought he was punching the rock guy, Ad Rock.
[105:25.17]Where even is Ad Rock?
[105:27.07]Oh, over here.
[105:36.58]It's really, really nice to see that you brought your son to Comic-Con.
[105:43.13]and dressed him up in a Decepticon outfit, and you're in an Optimus Prime outfit as the adult dad.
[105:58.75]Here, don't be frustrated.
[106:07.84]That looks like it's stuck to his hand and he's trying to get it off.
[106:10.91]Yeah, it kind of does.
[106:12.49]That was actually a pretty funny moment.
[106:14.33]Alright, competition, we don't have anything, right?
[106:23.26]We never got the three minute ad you promised us.
[106:25.06]Yes, I did.
[106:28.86]I did that at the very end.
[106:32.43]Sandbag, book, target, nothing new.
[106:35.54]I have to bring you, like, tablets or something, right?
[106:40.82]Where the fuck am I going to find these?
[106:45.22]More ads.
[106:45.76]I'm not running a three minute ad break right now.
[106:50.26]I don't have anything to do here.
[107:00.41]How am I going to fund your dunk tank?
[107:04.63]Don't worry.
[107:11.07]No, you're not getting an ad break.
[107:28.16]Okay, you're good, you're good, you're good, you're good.
[107:31.81]Let's look at this Shedful.
[107:33.59]Alright, two back-to-back tournaments to get you out of this dumb E rank.
[107:38.73]Rest and then tra- no, trampoline.
[107:40.45]No, actually this is fine.
[107:41.97]No, trampoline then rest.
[107:45.67]Trampoline.
[107:46.51]That's a fun word to say.
[107:49.13]Trampoline.
[107:51.88]You can rest.
[107:53.46]And then I want you doing sandbag.
[107:55.42]Alright.
[107:58.78]Lifeblade and then rest.
[108:02.68]And then you want to do... I don't know.
[108:04.85]Who cares?
[108:08.20]Like, no.
[108:10.38]Stand back.
[108:20.17]Hmm.
[108:21.81]Pretty bad gains.
[108:27.85]I subscribed and donated for ads.
[108:29.75]This is outrageous.
[108:35.76]Tired.
[108:37.24]You're hungry, too.
[108:42.15]Banana.
[108:45.39]Lots of vitamins.
[108:50.93]Please.
[108:51.33]I need vitamins.
[108:54.09]All you've been feeding me is bananas.
[109:00.30]That's just too much potassium and starch.
[109:03.72]You're killing me.
[109:05.46]Can I please get anything else?
[109:19.75]He doesn't want fruits.
[109:21.68]He just wants to be nutritious.
[109:23.84]He wants a balanced meal.
[109:26.94]Please, vitamins.
[109:31.06]Who's frustrated?
[109:31.92]Well, you'll be fine.
[109:35.77]Give him vitamins.
[109:36.53]I don't have vitamins.
[109:41.81]Okay, Spyroid.
[109:44.68]It's time for you to rank up.
[109:54.91]You're not getting any ads.
[109:55.85]I'm not going to do ads.
[110:04.82]For like the 40 people in chat that think this is funny, 2,000 of you don't.
[110:12.62]Three minutes of ads.
[110:13.82]This is just like no contest here.
[110:20.83]94%, 85% chance to hit this.
[110:26.40]He didn't even belong here.
[110:27.63]Why can't I just skip this league?
[110:42.70]I'm not gonna run a straw poll.
[110:48.14]Hey look, you want an ad?
[110:49.42]You really want an ad that bad?
[110:50.92]Just reload the page.
[110:54.57]You'll probably get one.
[111:05.65]That doesn't count.
[111:11.88]It's only 30 seconds.
[111:14.14]What the fuck?
[111:16.50]Why are you guys so accepting of, like, advertisements?
[111:19.52]Usually that's a thing that people don't want to see at all.
[111:26.19]Give us ads.
[111:26.99]Give us ads.
[111:38.53]Because your chat is fucking mental.
[111:41.53]What?
[111:46.87]They want the other 2,000 people to suffer.
[111:53.97]What a strange... What a strange little figurine.
[112:07.65]He doesn't know.
[112:08.37]What?
[112:24.04]He doesn't know.
[112:26.54]You guys don't.
[112:27.08]You guys don't know shit what you're talking about here.
[112:29.52]I know everything.
[112:30.68]Everything there is to know.
[112:31.75]If there's something to be known, I know it.
[112:37.99]Try me.
[112:46.63]Sandbag.
[112:48.64]Uh, you actually... No, just rest.
[112:51.60]Who gives a shit?
[112:52.24]Train.
[112:56.12]The Spyro is gonna just steamroll the whole thing anyways.
[113:05.52]How many houses are in the world?
[113:07.93]That is 642,941 in the United States.
[113:08.71]And you've got to specify what country.
[113:09.67]In the whole world, there's 742 million houses in the world.
[113:46.23]Not even close.
[113:55.43]Look it up.
[114:02.51]One house for every 2,000 Americans.
[114:04.55]One house for 2,000 people.
[114:18.45]90% don't have.
[114:19.61]Oh my god.
[114:20.25]That's a very big house.
[114:31.25]Here, eat a fucking potato.
[114:43.45]That means this one house for most of the people in this chat.
[114:49.62]What did I say?
[114:54.06]Don't be frustrated, here.
[115:03.65]Wow, you really are not focused at all.
[115:06.37]This is like the worst I've ever seen anybody not be focused.
[115:10.59]We're all watching you from the living room.
[115:12.28]Alright, you want a cake?
[115:13.66]Alright, how about a cake?
[115:16.95]No, you... No cake.
[115:18.89]What about a... No, you know what?
[115:20.01]Fine.
[115:20.27]You can have the cake.
[115:21.79]Take the cake!
[115:30.92]There we go.
[115:33.10]What's this clip?
[115:35.36]Oh, I can't even hear it.
[115:36.12]Never mind.
[115:41.70]What's your dream house?
[115:44.16]We've talked about my dream house, I think, on stream before.
[115:46.41]Why are we so frustrated?
[115:47.41]What the hell's going on here?
[115:50.79]Yeah, we already talked about it.
[116:02.91]I want... I want a huge bowling alley in my house.
[116:07.43]And I want the bed.
[116:08.97]Like, let's say there's ten lanes.
[116:11.35]I want a, like, septuple king size California king bed.
[116:16.46]in the middle that takes up like four lanes I want a bowling alley sized bed yeah
[116:40.70]And I want to cover the bed with, like, silk and grease.
[116:44.54]And I want to just do the... What was that thing that you used to put in the backyard?
[116:49.64]The slip and slide?
[116:52.42]I want to have a slip and slide bed.
[116:54.93]So I can run as fast as I can and slip and slide on the bed.
[116:58.07]And then just let me just keep going slide and then stop and fall asleep there.
[117:05.69]Yeah, we already talked about this.
[117:10.80]Alright, you guys have seen the movie Richie Rich?
[117:21.11]What about the movie Blank Check?
[117:24.41]Have you seen Blank Check?
[117:28.23]Let me go over the beginning of Blank Check and how insane and stupid of a movie that is.
[117:34.08]Blank Check is a movie about a kid that gets his bicycle run over by some criminal and like hits, like runs the kid over.
[117:47.54]Guy gets out of the car and the kid's like, what the heck?
[117:50.44]My new bicycle.
[117:51.40]And he's like, shh, shh, quiet kid.

[117:57.98]And the kid's like freaking out about his bike and shit.
[117:59.83]And the guy writes him a check.
[118:02.65]A blank check.
[118:05.26]and just signs it and gives it to him and the kid puts like a million dollars on the check and cashes it and gets the money and apparently the banking system would just allow that

[124:37.43]I just want a car that works and is easy to drive.
[124:55.30]No, I don't drive manuals.
[124:57.26]No.
[125:01.25]I'm the type of person that gets behind the wheel of a manual.
[125:04.42]And this is exactly what would happen.
[125:07.00]It would be fine.
[125:07.84]Everything would be going perfectly normally.
[125:09.57]I would be good.
[125:10.25]Everything would be fine.
[125:11.51]Pull up to that red light.
[125:12.65]Slow it down a little.
[125:16.29]Okay.
[125:19.47]Now let's start up.
[125:20.39]I've done this like a hundred times.
[125:21.93]Let's keep going.
[125:22.45]Get it out of neutral.
[125:23.05]Put the clutch up.
[125:24.17]Put it in first gear.
[125:26.35]Get it in second gear.
[125:27.69]And then accidentally put it in fourth gear.
[125:32.57]That'll be $2,500, please.
[125:43.54]I'm so stupid with that kind of shit, man.
[125:45.08]I would fuck it up at some point.
[125:46.12]I would.
[126:00.00]Nobody wants to hear your life story.
[126:11.02]I don't know why I'm thinking about this really.
[126:12.76]Going to like a convenience store.
[126:14.06]And like... Oh yeah, I want to pay.
[126:19.08]Put up like a fucking Tootsie Roll and a monster energy drink.
[126:23.38]I'm going to be paying in cash.
[126:26.83]And you think it's like scary?
[126:27.91]What am I going to feed him?
[126:40.02]I have a banana.
[126:51.17]Why are you paying for this energy drink in cash?
[126:54.55]What the fuck is this, huh?
[126:55.89]Why would you get this money?
[127:08.26]That's so fucking funny.
[127:10.48]It's not really, but it just like is.
[127:20.39]Alright, let's go to the... This dude's got like 20 in cash on him.
[127:28.02]Where'd that come from?
[127:29.14]Where'd you get that?
[127:48.06]How did you get that much?
[127:51.87]Alright, let's get Spyroid out of this, like, fucking wood rank already.
[127:59.28]Before I say other things that make no fucking sense.
[128:07.24]When are we gonna get rid of, like, the penny?
[128:10.31]That's another one.
[128:24.03]Aren't we the only country on Earth that still has like a one cent denomination in physical currency?
[128:42.82]No.
[128:42.88]You know, Canada's the only country that got rid of it.
[128:52.49]Is that true?
[128:58.87]Why are you still alive?
[129:00.17]Don't ruin this for me.
[129:02.60]Oh my god, I hate this game.
[129:05.82]He's gonna win!
[129:06.90]He's gonna win right here because of this.
[129:09.79]Don't do it again.
[129:31.79]You know what?
[129:32.33]I really would love... Somebody said I'd love like a $20 coin.
[129:34.93]That'd be kind of cool, wouldn't it be?
[129:38.65]To have like a $100 coin?
[129:50.26]You'd lose it.
[129:52.04]We could lose a $100 bill too and they still make those.
[130:04.54]It's heavier, too.
[130:07.24]And plus, hey, if that $100 bill gets stuck in your pockets or something and it gets in the laundry, that shit's all fucked up and it could be ripped up and destroyed.
[130:16.09]That coin's gonna be fine.
[130:20.45]And, yeah, why does it have to be... Why are you guys talking about, like, a quarter?
[130:26.01]Why wouldn't the... If it was a $100 coin, it would be the size of, like, a small, like, teacup.
[130:33.34]It would be, like, a frock.
[130:35.91]It would be like a tea saucer.
[130:40.24]It would weigh like four pounds to make sure you couldn't lose it.
[130:49.72]A $20 rock?
[130:59.71]Why not just have a $100 rock?
[131:01.13]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[131:01.89]Like, have a rock that's priced at $100.
[131:05.44]I'll let that nostalgia, like, this is what they used to trade when they were cavemen, so there's a nostalgia factor there.
[131:11.31]I didn't block that?
[131:21.43]Come on.
[131:23.18]So a diamond.
[131:23.82]A diamond is... Okay, a four-pound diamond that was as big as a teacup would be, like, $150 million.
[131:31.08]That's not a $20... What?
[131:31.62]What?
[131:40.66]four pounds of gold would be very expensive too no just there's no material like cubic zirconium or something that could be like a hundred bucks and you just bring that to the grocery store and they pay for your pay for your sunny delight
[132:18.19]He said, just replace, replace the dollar with a full can of Arizona iced tea.
[132:29.62]That's fucking awesome.
[132:33.56]Yeah, we got rid of the dollar.
[132:34.72]It's now, the one dollar denomination is a can of Arizona.
[132:40.73]What a pain in the ass.
[132:42.43]Imagine getting back like six dollar bills, you get six cans of Arizona iced tea.
[132:48.78]What a miserable experience.
[133:02.81]How the fuck are they able to still do that?
[133:07.89]I can't, like, think about that.
[133:09.43]We've had this conversation.
[133:10.57]I'm having, like, deja vu.
[133:12.40]Why is Arizona iced tea a dollar?
[133:17.95]There's like a gallon of iced tea in there.
[133:24.79]Is it just water and then like syrup?
[133:33.85]How come Arizona iced tea is 99 cents and like the one next to it on the shelf is $1.80 for less iced tea?
[133:46.40]Somebody said the Strip Club.
[133:49.14]It would be a bunch of fucking weirdos like drinking their iced teas and like putting them on the table.
[133:55.91]You just look around and guys like counting their strip club money.
[134:07.07]They got like fucking 40 Arizonas in a backpack.
[134:11.64]It would be a mess.
[134:18.54]People would be accidentally dropping them and like, they would be exploding and fizz would be going everywhere.
[134:25.91]A casino is just like a, you have to just open it and pour it in the machine.
[134:35.11]Those things are so heavy too.
[134:40.00]Going through the turn, the kiosk for like the toll.
[134:46.60]You just like whip out the window like fucking four Arizona iced teas.
[134:53.17]Out of the car.
[135:07.02]Oh, that's so fucking funny.
[135:11.30]Shit like that is just like... Yeah, I love that shit.
[135:17.83]Fucking absurd Wishing wells.
[135:25.16]Yeah, there's just floating hundreds of floating Arizona cans Arizona tea
[135:41.59]Okay, I gotta take a break.
[135:43.25]ATM, Arizona Tea Machine.
[135:45.41]I gotta pee.
[135:46.13]I'm gonna grab an Arizona iced tea.
[135:47.53]I'll be right back.
[139:49.30]Okay.
[139:51.10]Shall we?
[139:56.44]Oh, hey, yeah, I get grabbing tea.
[139:58.44]Be right back.
[140:10.81]But yeah, honestly, I don't know how... The Arizona iced tea just must... I don't know, maybe they sell a lot.
[140:20.41]Which Arizona did I get?
[140:21.27]The watermelon one.
[140:23.77]Green tea and honey.
[140:29.43]They have so many flavors, too.
[140:31.81]How do you have that many flavors?
[140:38.87]You know, I actually know what I've been... Hey, this is for real.
[140:40.30]You know what I've been doing lately?
[140:42.66]I've been... Like soda?
[140:45.50]No, get out of here.
[140:47.14]Juice?
[140:47.58]No, no, no, no, no juice.
[140:48.54]Get it out of here.
[140:50.15]You wanna, like, a little secret?
[140:52.05]Cut down on your sugar intake?
[140:53.97]Check it out.
[140:54.33]Ready?
[140:54.77]Listen to me.
[140:56.89]Take a glass of water.
[140:58.67]Right?
[141:00.65]Filtered water, probably, if you have it.
[141:03.07]So, just water.
[141:04.96]And put a little bit of ice in it.
[141:07.10]Take a bite of lemon.
[141:07.96]Just get, like, a bag of lemons that's, like, three or four dollars.
[141:14.06]Take one out.
[141:14.82]Roll it.
[141:15.78]On the counter.
[141:17.90]Cut that shit in half.
[141:20.54]Get a little lemon squeezer, like a little juicer, you know, things with the upside-down cone.
[141:24.73]And you go... The juice of a half lemon.
[141:34.56]Put that into the ice water.
[141:36.68]You know, strain it if you want to.
[141:38.82]And then add to that just one teaspoon of sugar.
[141:44.96]One teaspoon.
[141:45.93]No more.
[141:47.83]Spin it around with a straw.
[141:50.19]Enjoy it.
[141:55.42]One teaspoon!
[141:56.52]Make your own easy... It tastes much better than the lemonade you can buy at the store.
[142:02.18]Even the ones that are organic.
[142:03.86]They still load those things with shit.
[142:13.01]And if you don't want the sugar, you don't have to add it.
[142:16.31]But I like having a little bit of sweetness to my lemonade.
[142:21.45]It is just lemonade.
[142:22.15]I know that, what, you think this is some rocket scientific thing that I'm describing?
[142:31.74]Just squeeze half a lemon of juice into a glass of water with a little teaspoon of sugar, Ster it up.
[142:38.64]That's a healthy alternative
[142:41.31]to like monster or even like a orange juice.
[142:47.88]It's light, it's refreshing, it gets the bowels moving.
[143:01.78]I'm serious, now that's a good thing.
[143:05.34]Everything is a healthy replacement to Monster.
[143:07.72]You know, that's probably true.
[143:09.08]You know, probably smoking cigarettes is probably a healthy alternative to drinking Monster.
[143:13.26]Alright, who's got a tournament?
[143:21.85]You are in D now, right?
[143:23.03]Good.
[143:23.19]Let me see the schedule.
[143:30.20]Alright, so you are here now.
[143:31.70]We can do 1, 2, 3 and bring you up.
[143:39.01]Three of these in a row.
[143:43.59]And then the official tournament is here.
[143:46.94]I can't sign up for it yet.
[143:47.96]Alright, what about you?
[143:49.84]Roberto has one more tournament in S. Already signed up for it.
[143:55.70]And then the official cup is here.
[143:57.22]Hopefully we can... No, it's not.
[143:58.86]It's a group battle.
[144:00.69]Don't die before this.
[144:02.51]Fuck, I have to go find the stupid explorers.
[144:09.69]Blood is a healthy drink.
[144:10.81]I've been feeling a lot better since I started replacing soda with blood.
[144:16.59]Is that some kind of new energy drink or something?
[144:23.48]That's got to be some really interesting marketing campaign, right?
[144:27.08]I'm surprised no one's done that yet, if that's not true.
[144:34.28]Have it be, like, thick and red and, like, have a weird sugary flavor to it with a bunch of, like, B vitamins.
[144:40.62]Monster blood!
[144:41.51]Why have they not done that?
[144:50.61]Okay, that's fine.
[144:51.45]You should rest here.
[144:53.46]Rest, and then... I gotta look at stats here.
[145:02.89]212.
[145:04.39]Terrible life.
[145:05.29]I gotta work on life right now.
[145:07.29]Life and speed.
[145:09.59]They're just awful.
[145:11.75]Or life and defense.
[145:12.93]I think I'm gonna get speed, at least.
[145:14.81]That's abysmal.
[145:23.88]There's speed here.
[145:25.42]Get on that trampoline.
[145:27.98]Then you can rest.
[145:30.05]You do a lie, then you can chill.
[145:31.63]You can rest.
[145:35.31]You can do sandbag.
[145:36.33]You can do... Accuracy.
[145:51.20]Well, that was a huge gain for our improver.
[145:55.96]I miss Beanbag Sonic.
[145:57.04]I think we all do.
[145:58.56]But his legacy lives on.
[146:09.79]I think you deserve the salmon.
[146:12.57]Yeah, you do.
[146:17.39]We gotta get you up.
[146:24.45]Frustrated, why?
[146:25.43]You don't like fish?
[146:27.83]Oh no, that wrong person.
[146:30.73]Is Roberto alive?
[146:31.53]Yeah, Roberto's still alive.
[146:32.83]Tired though.
[146:33.31]How about a carrot?
[146:40.94]But that's Roberto Salmon.
[146:44.48]Use them before he expires?
[146:46.66]I will.
[146:48.10]I'm saving before every week in case he dies.
[146:49.94]Then I'm just gonna reload and then put him on ice.
[146:53.95]Get the dragon up.
[146:54.73]Are they friends?
[147:00.81]I gotta get them to be good friends.
[147:06.75]That's breeder info.
[147:12.45]I mean, they're good friends, but I want them to be great friends.
[147:16.15]I gotta take them on an adventure.

[149:12.47]Okay, you're doing good.
[149:14.73]You are okay.
[149:16.75]Let's pray to you.
[149:18.90]You got a big tourney coming up before you die.
[149:28.18]That's so sad, but it's true.
[149:37.19]Alright, Spyroid.
[149:38.61]Clean it up.
[149:49.70]My toilet water tastes like- I can't drink sweet tea.
[149:55.16]Sweet tea hurts.
[150:06.42]If I drink sweet tea, I feel bad.
[150:09.38]My body hurts.
[150:17.70]Wearing the pumpkin goggles.
[150:20.30]Pumpkin VR.
[150:31.92]But you see sometimes, I understand, I like having things sweet.
[150:36.35]I like sugary stuff, right?
[150:38.65]I like drinking soda sometimes, I like sweetened things, I like sugary things, cakes, ice cream, right?
[150:47.06]But you really get to know somebody, you get to see who they are, who they truly are, when they order a tea from a restaurant and watch how much sugar they put into their iced tea.
[150:59.03]You really... They can tell you anything they want about themselves.
[151:01.21]You'll know exactly who they are.
[151:10.87]I see some people... With like an unsweetened tea that they get from ice from the restaurant.
[151:17.34]They put in... Like ten sugar packets.
[151:22.66]What's going on there?
[151:23.96]Why... What's... What's going on there?
[151:25.64]Why are you... What's going on... Why are you doing that?
[151:31.65]It's too much.
[151:42.69]Ten, that's rookie numbers.
[151:49.25]Okay, the coffee is another situation here, right?
[151:55.05]There are people that order like a... And if you're one of these people...
[151:59.62]Then it's alright to be one of these people.
[152:03.14]But just be careful.
[152:03.84]I'm not telling you how to drink your coffee, but a double, double, double cream, double sugar.
[152:12.57]Be careful.
[152:20.21]You end up, it's like you're drinking ice cream.
[152:23.19]It's milk and sugar.
[152:25.71]Double, double.
[152:27.70]double cream double sugar in a regular coffee and When I say regular I'm talking if you go to like Dunkin Donuts, they're regular already like a regular iced coffee from Dunkin I believe has four or five teaspoons.
[152:41.77]I think tablespoons of sugar Easy You work with someone who drinks four times four and
[152:56.63]Man, just be careful.
[152:58.57]That's so much.
[152:59.53]That's an insane amount of sugar.
[153:15.18]Unprover.
[153:21.77]I don't care if you drink your coffee black or if you drink your coffee with double-double.
[153:28.34]But if you're going to order like a ultra quad, just order an ice cream.
[153:34.81]It's probably better.
[153:37.95]Do you tell people that when you have coffee with them?
[153:41.57]Be careful.
[153:44.87]Yeah, I'll take a quad, quad, 15 sugar, half cream.

[160:50.78]Okay.
[160:55.07]His accuracy is fine.
[160:56.29]It's just the life, defense, and speed are abysmal.
[161:00.95]I'm going to get health to over 800.
[161:05.08]Now, if we do get to 200 health before anything else, because that's killing me.
[161:12.00]He does have over 200 IQ.
[161:14.22]So you can use that funny video-on-demand live broadcasting meme here.
[161:32.88]So.
[161:34.48]Life Blade.
[161:35.44]Rest.
[161:36.34]Life Blade.

[162:13.24]You like these?
[162:13.84]Thank you.
[162:27.14]Don't tell me how to live my life.
[162:30.22]I'm not telling you how to live your life.
[162:32.14]I'm just telling you to be careful.
[162:35.93]Never once did I say, you should not, do, don't put that much sugar in your coffee.
[162:41.83]Did I say that?
[162:43.19]I never said that.
[162:45.31]I said to be careful.
[162:51.62]It's different than don't.
[162:55.18]Do not, right?
[163:00.09]It's a threat.
[163:00.87]What is not?
[163:02.07]What are you talking about?
[163:03.41]What are you saying here?
[163:05.80]Why can I not select you?
[163:09.10]No, my god!
[163:11.22]The person on the trampoline.
[163:23.59]You aggressively told us to make lemonade for 10 straight minutes.
[163:35.60]I did, I did.
[163:36.96]I did not aggressively tell you to make lemonade.
[163:40.98]I was aggressively describing my lemonade procedure.
[163:47.20]It's a shitty lemonade.
[163:48.91]Alright, I didn't even tell you the next part would add a little bit of basil in it.
[163:53.51]I was cut off by the screams.
[164:09.31]You guys.
[164:09.93]Like, you.
[164:20.80]That makes it sound... Basil?
[164:23.36]Basil?
[164:23.68]That's fine.
[164:24.12]What's wrong with lemon and basil?
[164:27.58]You guys are angry at one of the best combos?
[164:31.53]Basil and lemon?
[164:35.57]Have you ever had basil lemon ice cream before?
[164:39.45]What do you mean, oh my goodness, no, I am gonna get angry.
[164:42.95]Lemon and basil is an incredible combination.
[164:51.76]What is happening to my character right now?
[164:53.36]Why do they suck now?
[164:55.58]Why do you suck?
[165:06.43]That's bad.
[165:11.70]Got it?
[165:12.68]Alright, I see one swing.
[165:13.92]What's the swing at?
[165:18.57]63.
[165:18.77]No!
[165:20.65]63.
[165:25.55]Don't counter this, thank god.
[165:28.69]I am the victory.
[165:34.45]They disagree with your beverage preferences.
[165:36.38]It's basil and lemon.
[165:39.54]They go together.
[165:41.93]Like two peas in a pod.
[165:50.36]Early.
[165:53.02]That's a pretty good Jerma985 name.
[165:56.18]Mint, idiot.
[166:00.21]Okay, next you'll be asking me to squeeze toothpaste in it.
[166:02.91]Disgusting.
[166:04.47]Disgusting, next!
[166:15.32]They go together like peanut butter and mayonnaise.
[166:17.52]Alright, you know what?
[166:19.10]I'm gonna put this to bed right now.
[166:25.61]Lemons and basil.
[166:30.03]Lemon and basil lemonade.
[166:32.51]Put the lemon, basil, sugar, and zest in a bowl.
[166:36.22]Muddle this mixture until the basil is well bruised and the sugar is mixed in.
[166:39.72]Transfer to a pitcher.
[166:40.94]Add the lemon juice and water and Ster.
[166:42.55]Refrigerate, allowing the basil and zest to infuse more flavor at least an hour.

[167:14.40]You find me... Oh my goodness, we're done with that.
[167:16.82]I don't need to talk about it anymore.
[167:32.50]What do you mean, fake?
[167:38.48]What's with all the deleted messages?
[167:39.82]Because they're disagreeing with the streamer!
[167:45.50]What about lemon and basil ice cream?
[167:46.83]It's fantastic.
[167:48.83]I'm serious.
[167:50.23]Just try it.
[167:51.49]That was 426 damage.
[167:54.99]Oh my god.
[167:56.67]I super killed that guy.
[168:08.02]It's not disgusting.
[168:11.54]I'll tell you what's disgusting.
[168:13.48]Oh, lemon basil ice cream is disgusting.
[168:15.61]I'll tell you what's disgusting.
[168:17.79]Would you like to know?
[168:18.83]Yeah.
[168:19.41]Hey, let's talk about it.
[168:20.95]What do you put?
[168:21.57]Yeah, stuff like a bunch of chocolate chunks and fudge brownies and Reese's in my ice cream.
[168:28.13]Hey, you know what I want?
[168:29.99]Put a bunch of cookie dough in it.
[168:32.89]Lemon basil.
[168:34.12]Excuse me.
[168:40.26]What is this, a bird?
[168:42.50]What the fuck was that?
[168:45.08]That was a hand puppet.
[168:46.60]That was a bird hand puppet.
[168:51.46]What the fuck was that thing?
[168:59.95]What about vanilla ice cream with honey and marshmallows?
[169:02.11]I'll allow that.
[169:04.15]Okay.
[169:12.81]No, I'll allow that.
[169:14.05]LOL that.
[169:15.44]Lemon basil is a boomer flavor.
[169:17.18]Until you try it.
[169:20.30]And then you're gonna secretly, you'll be, you'll come back in the chat, you'll be like, Lemon and basil, he's a fucking idiot.
[169:25.60]But secretly you're gonna be like, that was fucking really good.
[169:31.36]I'm just memeing in the chat now.
[169:42.10]Holy shit, he turned into an airplane.
[169:45.16]Oh, God.
[169:45.74]Okay, thank God it didn't hurt that much.
[169:46.88]What do you get?
[169:50.46]Lemon basil ice cream?
[169:52.68]You... Organic.
[169:54.02]You grow it yourself.
[169:57.76]Got it.
[170:09.93]Alright.
[170:10.69]Bongo.
[170:12.13]Flour and heen.
[170:15.23]Just grow the lemons and grow the basil.
[170:17.99]Churn your own ice cream.
[170:18.99]Buying ice cream from the store.
[170:22.36]Next you'll tell me that you go to the freezer aisle and you buy ice cream from there.
[170:25.20]Fuck you.
[170:29.26]Fuck off driving by here.
[170:43.89]Jerma makes ice cream from his own breast milk.
[170:48.37]That's so fucked up.
[170:57.12]I can't even... Why does he read the gross comments?
[171:07.40]I don't know because they stick out!
[171:12.20]Because that's really absurd!
[171:18.39]You have the option to stop mid-sentence.
[171:19.93]No, I don't.
[171:21.82]I have forward or backward.
[171:25.06]I don't have stop.
[171:40.93]Let's hear backwards.
[171:46.92]I told you guys to lay off with the whole lemon basil thing.
[171:49.90]I mean come on
[172:24.35]I'm trying to make lemon basil lemonade from scratch, but I can't figure out how to invent the universe.
[172:32.04]What a joke.
[172:35.50]What a jokey thing.
[172:43.09]Blank.
[172:45.97]Blank.
[172:51.87]So we have, okay, so, okay, so we have a few things to do here.
[172:56.92]Okay, so we got a few things.
[173:00.88]Alright, guys, so we can, alright, what are we gonna do here?
[173:04.46]Let's think about, okay, so we can do, yeah, you can rest.
[173:16.96]Yeah, book, target, tub, rest.
[173:20.43]And you have the tournament today.
[173:21.75]Don't fuck it up.
[173:30.13]Good increase.
[173:32.05]Good increase.
[173:39.64]I made up the whole thing.
[173:40.68]Of lemon basil ice cream?
[173:41.70]I did not.
[173:50.05]Mmm, I'm running out of food.
[173:53.97]Here, have a banana.
[174:01.17]Never had a lemon in- lemon's probably my favorite fruit.
[174:16.65]I just like lemon juice.
[174:18.77]I like lemon zest.
[174:21.08]Lemon is an incredibly versatile thing.
[174:26.90]Mario and Zelda are going to work with Labo VR.
[174:29.60]Oh, that's going to be fun.
[174:37.27]Need a lemon on stream.
[174:38.63]No, lemon's the best fruit that you don't eat.
[174:43.57]It's used in so many things, but you don't actually eat lemons.
[174:49.53]It's kind of weird how that works.
[175:00.55]What do you mean you do?
[175:04.13]You guys like cut a lemon in half and like eat the fruit out like a grapefruit or like an orange?
[175:10.74]I don't believe anybody that's saying that.
[175:12.46]None of you.
[175:17.22]I just really don't believe that at all.
[175:26.39]You're gonna fuck up like your stomach acid.
[175:28.97]Yep.
[175:29.71]Be careful.
[175:41.57]Alright, we got a single battle with Spyroid.
[175:43.53]Can you do it this time and actually win?
[175:54.46]That's like saying eating a pickle fucks you up.
[175:56.64]What?
[175:59.28]Lemon juice straight is insanely acidic.
[176:05.70]Pickles are pickled... I don't believe it.
[176:21.82]What's my opinion on limes?
[176:24.30]Yeah, they're like the jokey side character next to a lemon.
[176:27.11]Lemon's the main character.
[176:34.60]Plus, lime also kind of tastes like throw-up, so...
[176:57.54]This guy, this character sucks.
[177:03.70]Sarah, come like, what's wrong with this guy?
[177:12.15]He can't land anything and his moves don't hurt.
[177:20.39]I just gotta keep him away from tournaments.
[177:24.73]No, I actually, I love lemons and I love limes.
[177:29.56]I don't like limes as much.
[177:30.55]Limes are good on food more than lemons for me.
[177:35.11]Like a squeeze of lime adds a lot more.
[177:38.37]I lost four fans.
[177:40.19]Well, that's what happens when you lose two tournaments in a row.
[177:44.01]And there's the backtrack.
[177:44.97]No, I said... Okay, fine.
[177:46.97]I'm not going to backtrack it.
[177:47.79]I don't like limes.
[177:49.50]They're only good when you squeeze it on like a piece of meat or something.
[178:04.72]That's 90% of their use.
[178:06.04]Yeah, but I'm talking about... I'm talking pure just flavor.
[178:08.67]Eating a lime versus eating a lemon.
[178:15.75]But I would rather you fill a... Like a tub of... Nah, I don't think I would... No.
[178:24.23]I can't... I wouldn't do that either way, so... I never had limeade?
[178:31.59]Yeah, I have.
[178:31.93]It's just... It tastes... It's too sour for me.
[178:34.42]limeade versus lemonade limeade has that weird super like puckery aftertaste lemonade does not alright please just do life in defense just don't do anything else just life over and over again strawberry lemonade I love strawberry lemonade
[179:05.41]It's really good.
[179:07.83]Cherry Limeade?
[179:08.69]I've never had that before.
[179:09.55]That sounds pretty good.
[179:12.09]Maybe one day I'll find it.
[179:13.05]Alright, you need to rest.
[179:20.16]You're frustrated.
[179:21.88]Rest.
[179:23.00]Rest.
[179:24.24]Target.
[179:25.02]Send.
[179:25.34]Nah, rest.
[179:26.20]You're all like... You're all fucked up.
[179:30.20]Cherry Limeade is good.
[179:38.19]I'll have to try it.
[179:38.63]I've never had cherry limeade.
[179:46.59]Do I live under a rock?
[179:51.83]I don't think I've ever had cherry limeade before.
[179:55.56]If I have, I didn't really... I didn't go, holy shit, and remember it.
[180:01.89]Favorite flavor of Red Bull?
[180:03.03]None of them.
[180:03.35]I drank one.
[180:04.53]I drank like two of them three weeks ago and had the worst migraine I've ever had in probably the last five years.
[180:09.32]So I stopped.
[180:13.46]Is there a none of the above?
[180:28.83]Just drink one?
[180:30.31]I didn't drink, like, three.
[180:32.77]I had one.
[180:36.08]And then I had one the next day.
[180:37.90]I didn't just slam him.
[180:48.16]Be careful.
[180:49.98]Be careful.
[180:52.82]Okay, you're lively.
[180:54.02]You're fine.
[180:54.44]You don't need to eat anything.
[180:55.18]You're good.
[180:57.63]Everyone's doing just fine.
[180:58.91]You're fine.
[181:00.69]You're fine.
[181:03.97]Everyone's good to go.
[181:09.95]Keep going.
[181:10.47]There's a way to make lemonade sweet without sugar.
[181:19.27]Just add... That's not... That's disgusting.
[181:25.03]I love mayonnaise, but it only belongs in certain things for me.
[181:32.17]Wait, did you say he loves mayonnaise?
[181:35.65]Right?
[181:39.31]He puts mayo on like a turkey sandwich?
[181:41.07]Yeah, it's fantastic actually.
[181:48.59]And don't even throw this nonsense at me from Miracle Whip.
[181:53.85]That stuff is unedible.
[181:58.32]It's unedible.
[182:04.94]It tastes like poison.
[182:05.98]Miracle Whip tastes to me like what poison tastes like, if I've ever had it.
[182:14.42]And this is in my personal opinion, I'm just saying.
[182:17.24]I don't really like Miracle Whip.
[182:18.12]Okay, I gotta be careful here.
[182:19.14]Just be careful.
[182:33.78]To be completely fair though, Miracle Whip actually is pretty good in certain recipes where it replaces mayonnaise and it tastes better.
[182:41.55]But on a sandwich though, that's a yuck.
[182:49.03]He's wrong.
[182:52.29]That's not a backtrack, I just said yuck.
[183:00.99]He's spineless.
[183:01.97]No, I just said it was, I think it's yucky.
[183:09.90]Guys, don't ever have an opinion on the internet.
[183:11.66]Someone will throw a drink in your face.
[183:18.58]Sorry, the only way I'm allowed to have an opinion on Miracle Whip is if I go to like a mayonnaise Reddit and we like talk about how bad it is.
[183:45.38]Is there?
[183:45.68]No, there can't be.
[183:48.36]What am I saying?
[183:49.12]There probably has to be.
[183:53.21]I like everyone's schedules here.
[183:56.49]Sandbag.
[183:57.27]Book.
[183:58.13]Tub.
[183:59.41]Target.
[184:00.15]Lifeblade.
[184:07.85]I'm honestly surprised that there's an active Batman Arkham Reddit than a Mayonnaise one.
[184:21.33]What?
[184:22.35]Japanese mayo is fucking amazing.
[184:26.07]It is unbelievable.
[184:29.37]If you've never had Japanese mayo before, you gotta get it.
[184:53.37]Isn't mayonnaise just whipped oil and eggs?
[184:56.85]Shh.
[184:59.11]Don't tell anybody that.
[185:16.45]I don't know where you got that secret recipe from, but what the fuck, man?
[185:20.99]I'm going to have to delete this VOD.
[185:26.84]Fuck, I can't believe somebody actually just said that.
[185:38.44]A aioli is next level.
[185:39.70]Yeah, like a garlic aioli.
[185:42.72]You guys are gonna make me want a sandwich.
[185:59.89]You know, I don't know why, but for right now, I don't know what it was.
[186:04.43]Somebody said the word, like, garlic and then mayonnaise and then sauerkraut came in my mind.
[186:09.47]And then, like, Swiss cheese popped up and then pastrami showed up.
[186:13.71]And then Thousand Island dressing just showed up, too.
[186:16.37]With toasted rye bread.
[186:17.59]And now I want that.
[186:20.02]I want a pastrami sandwich right now.
[186:23.18]I want a Reuben.
[186:24.80]Or it could be just pastrami.
[186:26.36]It doesn't matter.
[186:26.76]With mustard, maybe.
[186:29.33]Hmm.
[186:32.89]Ugh.
[186:35.56]Damn.
[186:39.44]Swiss cheese is bad?
[186:40.42]Come on.
[186:42.32]That's not true.
[186:50.02]Thousand Island is shit.
[186:54.57]Guys, food is more subjective than like art or comedy.
[186:58.46]You know that, right?
[186:59.12]Think about how many stand-up comics you've seen that you were like, oh, those jokes weren't funny.
[187:07.27]Multiply that by 500 million types of food.
[187:23.29]Everyone's good.
[187:24.46]I think it's the tournament right now, right?
[187:29.48]There are so many kinds of food.
[187:34.04]Group battle.
[187:35.00]This is not... I don't have anybody up here.
[187:37.58]I need to do the stupid find the guy in the forest.
[187:44.81]Yeah, the amount of food combinations you can make.
[187:48.61]There's so many of them.
[187:57.44]There's as many types of foods as there are houses.
[188:00.42]At least.
[188:01.72]Do you like gyros?
[188:03.32]I do.
[188:05.34]I do love gyros.
[188:06.62]They're amazing.
[188:07.94]Chicken gyro.
[188:11.91]No competitions, just train and send people to the dungeon, whatever the hell it is.
[188:19.14]Look, we talked about this already.
[188:23.22]There's a bunch of, I've had a ton of delicious gyros, gyros, gyros.
[188:29.73]Every time I order one, I get corrected on the phone.
[188:32.89]I've ordered a gyro from probably 15 different establishments, and I say it, I say, yeah, can I get a chicken gyro, please?
[188:44.02]Chicken gyro.
[188:45.52]Yeah, yeah, that's the one.
[188:47.30]I then call another place.
[188:49.54]Hey, can I get a chicken gyro, please?
[188:51.64]A chicken gyro?
[188:53.62]Yeah, yeah, that's the one.
[188:54.39]Yes, of course.
[188:55.61]This happens every time.
[188:56.95]So it doesn't... What am I supposed to do?
[189:07.76]From my understanding, it's like gyro, right?
[189:10.30]Like gyro?
[189:11.60]Like gyro?
[189:15.44]Are they just fucking with me on the phone?
[189:19.47]So I am saying it correctly, but how can I get corrected?
[189:23.23]On the phone?
[189:30.40]Like, I'll take one chicken gyro, please.
[189:34.14]Okay, one chicken gyro.
[189:36.92]Like, almost like they're underhandedly correcting me.
[189:39.50]And I'm like, yeah.
[189:47.35]Alright, what we got for you?
[189:48.51]Let's do more Life Blade.
[189:49.65]Life Blade, Life Blade.
[189:56.08]You are going to do Power.
[189:57.52]I forget about Ad Rock.
[190:15.40]I don't care about this guy at all.
[190:16.88]I don't want to even put him on the ranch anymore.
[190:21.86]But I'm going to level him up a little so he has friends.
[190:24.18]Alright, you rest and then we'll get you on the book again.
[190:50.19]Tons of power.
[190:51.13]That's a good life increase.
[190:52.37]I'm just going to keep... I'm going to spam life on Spyro.
[190:59.43]Yeah, I could go for like a corned beef sandwich right now.
[191:05.83]You're good.
[191:07.13]Who's not having... Who's having a rough time here?
[191:08.85]Oh, you.
[191:09.35]Okay.
[191:14.09]What about avocado toast?
[191:17.90]Yeah, I mean, avocado toast is... Man, I'd put an egg on it.
[191:23.34]That's just for me, you know.
[191:30.19]I don't order it, but sometimes it's available.
[191:37.94]Like a poached egg or a nice cooked egg on top.
[191:52.59]That's vegan?
[191:53.17]No, that's not a- What do you mean a vegan food?
[191:54.69]What are you talking- What do you mean?
[191:57.05]I just told you I put an egg on it.
[192:05.74]I need to win.
[192:06.44]Alright, he's dead.
[192:11.40]He'll be dead real soon.
[192:12.70]I gotta be- Ugh.
[192:16.51]How do I pronounce caramel?
[192:19.43]It depends on the day.
[192:22.78]Caramel, caramel, caramel, caramel.
[192:25.43]I don't know.
[192:27.21]It just depends.
[192:37.08]You're all good.
[192:38.42]Continue.
[192:39.54]Save it.
[192:40.12]Did I save it?
[192:40.50]Just do it again.
[192:57.79]Caramel.
[193:02.33]Okay, well, I need to look at stats, because Unprover has seriously gained 20 in a couple of categories, more than four or five times.
[193:09.31]Let me see this.
[193:21.25]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
[193:22.25]What are you doing?
[193:22.90]Stop shaking around.
[193:23.48]What the fuck is this?
[193:24.76]Hey!
[193:26.24]Hey!
[193:31.61]What is this doing this for?
[193:32.65]What are you doing?
[193:46.10]Uh, why are you doing this?
[193:47.94]This is weird.
[193:53.74]My shit's like getting all fucked up.
[194:03.59]This might be like a bug in the game, not necessarily the hardware I have.
[194:09.73]Okay, that was weird.
[194:11.83]No, that was a bug in the game.
[194:23.38]Strange.
[194:25.28]Anyways, what was I doing?
[194:26.15]I was looking at it over here.
[194:31.72]Joke incoming?
[194:32.54]No, no, I just... I... It's just that screen.
[194:38.36]Don't ask me why the hell that happens on this own... Why?
[194:41.94]It's probably the winter.
[194:48.57]Um, I really would love to look at the stats.
[194:53.65]Apparently not, though.
[194:56.87]Well, I'm just gonna have to try tomorrow.
[195:03.88]I'm out of food.
[195:07.62]Fuck, everyone, I'm out of food.
[195:19.69]I thought the disk was fucking up at first?
[195:21.31]Yeah.
[195:23.31]Uh, I need... I gotta feed you something.
[195:25.71]Beef.
[195:27.69]You're not gonna want that beef, though, I don't think.
[195:29.37]I have five beef.
[195:42.11]Why am I playing this?
[195:45.03]This is... I like this game.
[195:47.42]Will you eat, uh... chocolate?
[195:52.14]Here, have a chocolate.
[196:03.27]You liked it?
[196:03.71]Good.
[196:05.91]Alright, you're gonna have to wait.
[196:08.57]You're gonna have to eat something here, too.
[196:13.17]You can have a beef too.
[196:20.76]What's a food combo you like that nobody else likes?
[196:23.84]I like cut up cucumber and cold hot dogs with hot sauce and lemon juice.
[196:27.73]Well, I'll tell you one of my favorite things in the world.
[196:31.85]I'm not sure I ever talked about this before, but let's talk about it now.
[196:35.33]I love nice, firm, crispy french fries.
[196:40.57]I dip them in tuna.
[196:43.83]Like tuna fish.
[196:45.70]If I have fries in a tuna sandwich or something, I'm talking about the mayo whipped up tuna fish.
[196:52.46]Sandwich type tuna.
[196:54.52]And dip fries in it.
[196:57.73]And it's really good.
[196:58.94]It tastes great.
[196:59.80]It's got a lot going on there.
[197:03.64]Yeah, like tuna salad.
[197:04.40]Like a tuna fish that's mixed in.
[197:06.00]Like the kind of tuna fish you order in a sub or you put on a sandwich.
[197:12.04]Also, on top of that, pretzel.
[197:14.24]If you do... One of my favorite snacks was just make a bunch of tuna, take like one or two cans of tuna, whip it up with the mayonnaise, add a little sprinkle, a little bit of fucking basil in there.
[197:24.20]Don't do that, but, you know, I'm making a joke reference to the last like four or five hours of talking.
[197:29.56]And just dip pretzels, like hard pretzels, into the tuna fish and eat it.
[197:37.54]I'm serious, like that's, it's fantastic.
[197:41.17]Another thing, weirdly enough, this isn't a staple, I know, but not this way.
[197:47.65]If you take a hard pretzel, like if you go get a bag of pretzels from the grocery store or whatever, and American cheese, just slices of American cheese.
[197:57.84]Take one slice of American cheese, take a bite of the pretzel, and then take a little bit of the American cheese and put it in your mouth and eat it.
[198:05.32]At the same time, the combination of those two things
[198:09.05]is God-like.
[198:11.17]It is absolutely God-like.
[198:16.42]You have to try it.
[198:22.16]Normal cheese?
[198:22.78]No, it's got to just be like American cheese.
[198:29.16]Don't melt it.
[198:30.90]The flavor doesn't make any sense.
[198:33.56]It's a perfect flavor combination.
[198:37.32]You could do it with cheddar too, you could, but I'm just giving you my recommendation.
[198:49.27]You could do that with pretty much any cold sliced cheese.
[198:53.43]I wouldn't do it with Swiss.
[198:55.13]Cheddar, American, provolone.
[198:57.50]Provolone is amazing with this exact technique.
[199:00.72]In fact, I'd probably recommend provolone and the hard pretzel over American cheese and hard pretzel.
[199:11.06]That's fine, everybody can say what they want.
[199:12.94]I'm just telling you, it tastes so good together.
[199:21.34]It is a secret technique.
[199:34.97]Pretzels and cheese together?
[199:36.03]Yeah, but people when... people eating pretzels and cheese...
[199:40.09]They typically, it's not just like a sliced deli cheese and biting hard pretzel.
[199:44.55]Pretzels and cheese is a big baked pretzel with a cheese dipping sauce.
[199:49.23]Not the same.
[199:50.53]It does not taste the same.
[199:51.57]It's incredibly different.
[199:52.69]Trust me.
[200:09.41]Gonna open up my own fucking restaurant.
[200:12.36]Tuna and french fries.
[200:14.62]Sliced provolone cheese and hard pretzels that I bought from the grocery store.
[200:19.94]Basil lemonade ice cream.
[200:24.12]Let's get some mangoes.
[200:31.83]You'd be out of business in minutes.
[200:33.49]I disagree.
[200:41.01]Oh.
[200:42.23]Yeah, like 300 bucks for a, uh, watermelon.
[200:46.35]I have to replace it.
[200:51.18]It's a u- unless- what?
[200:52.98]Wait, what?
[200:54.16]I got plenty of beef still, let's just get a couple more of them.
[200:58.47]Grab a few bananas.
[201:00.73]And be on our way!
[201:13.08]I wouldn't be able to even beat Diner Dash.
[201:15.98]Why would I play Diner Dash?
[201:20.84]Diner Dash is the type of game that your mom accidentally downloaded in a virus Facebook website.
[201:26.72]And she's still playing it for some reason.
[201:39.56]But!
[201:41.26]That's fine.
[201:46.10]But, I can't backtrack that one.
[201:50.00]But, you know, that's fine.
[201:55.40]Fuck.
[201:57.10]Hey, somebody just gave me a lot of money.
[202:02.70]50 bucks from KXE.
[202:05.28]5,000 bits, thank you.
[202:10.48]I give you the $50, 5,000 bits.
[202:13.30]Loving the Monster Rancher streams, Jerma.
[202:15.38]These games are comfy as fuck, no lie.
[202:19.14]Yeah, I love playing games like this.
[202:21.80]Because we can just sit here and just talk shit about whatever we want and just have anything we want.
[202:26.15]Any topic can be rifled out here.
[202:29.17]Doesn't matter, we can just talk about anything.
[202:31.71]Half the things we're saying aren't even real, but still fun.
[202:35.41]It's a comfy game.
[202:39.11]But thank you for the $50.
[202:39.63]5,000 bits of KXE.
[202:42.83]Insane contributions.
[202:49.34]Play Animal Crossing?
[202:50.16]When the new one comes out, I'll play it.
[202:51.36]I'm gonna... By the way, that stream title is gonna be... Trying Not To Rage... At Animal Crossing.
[203:03.95]Like, and then, like, in parentheses, like, Death Counter.
[203:13.32]Okay, you're gonna rest, and then we'll do life training.
[203:19.04]Stack health.
[203:24.11]You can do... Target.
[203:28.49]You can rest.
[203:32.40]Yep, he's probably so close to death.
[203:34.96]And I didn't even get to A rank.
[203:36.16]Because I'm supposed to take...
[203:40.16]Uh, I think I'm gonna bring him in to the jungle and try to get that next rank to unlock the new monsters.
[203:46.81]I have to try.
[203:49.83]Yeah, everybody rest up.
[203:50.91]We're taking the strong.
[203:52.03]We're gonna take Roberto, Spyroid, and Blossom into the forest.
[203:59.25]Not the forest, the jungle.
[204:07.78]Has to be done.
[204:10.80]And then we have to combine... I need at least to get to A rank before I move on from this game.
[204:28.83]You know?
[204:29.41]Like, I have to at least unlock A rank.
[204:32.17]What an accomplishment that would be.
[204:38.72]Okay.
[204:39.14]Jungle.
[204:40.30]Let's bring Roberto.
[204:43.24]And Spyroid.
[204:44.60]And Blossom.
[204:46.20]These are the ones that are doing well here.
[204:48.06]Hey, this is a good place to look at stats.
[204:52.98]Pretty balanced across the board.
[204:54.09]Life, intelligence, and accuracy.
[204:56.99]Actually, really balanced across the board.
[205:01.67]You are, like, better than Spyroid.
[205:03.97]164 to 12.
[205:08.22]Much more balanced.
[205:13.97]Look at the power on Roberto.
[205:16.49]He's at almost 500 power.
[205:19.29]I have to get him in the next tournament before he dies.
[205:21.51]Alright, let's go.
[205:44.06]I should start a Lunchables restaurant.
[205:47.72]How long do you think it would take?
[205:51.12]So if I opened up a restaurant called like, Jerma'S FOOD or WELCOME TO THE RESTAURANT.
[205:55.17]Well, it doesn't matter.
[205:55.99]Whatever the fucking placeholder name could be.
[205:58.25]How long would it take if I were to buy a bunch of frozen dinners and shit?
[206:03.99]Like stuff from the grocery store.
[206:05.51]Unpackage it, like heat it up and like pretend and put it on the menu and all that.
[206:10.75]How long would it take for someone to figure out that I wasn't making this food?
[206:21.78]few hours?
[206:22.30]I don't think so.
[206:23.00]If I went to the frozen section and picked out like, I don't know, like Hungry Man and plated it so it looked really nice, it would probably take a little while.
[206:52.75]I have a burger on the menu and it's just the frozen patty from the grocery store.
[206:57.58]And I just, I put like kale on it and shit.
[207:01.62]I put like a nice little garlic sauce on it and I don't think people would know.
[207:05.18]This is literally what they do?
[207:25.98]I- I- Microwaving a TV dinner, and then putting it and presenting it a different way on a plate, and calling it, like, chicken à la carte.
[207:38.21]And it's like the... kid cuisine.
[207:41.91]Fried chicken.
[207:45.51]I really think it would take a couple months before somebody figured it out.
[207:51.82]I worked at a restaurant for three years we did that.
[207:55.46]People actually doing that?
[208:02.40]With blue pudding.
[208:03.98]Yeah, like the shitty little square brownie thing that they have.
[208:10.84]That's on there too.
[208:15.47]The brownie that is the whole... It's like a well.
[208:19.13]And it's supposed to be a brownie, but it's just a well of chocolate cake mix.
[208:30.67]Corn that's half frozen.
[208:40.91]Eating it uncooked is the best.
[208:43.65]I've never done that.
[208:44.41]Okay, you would be able to figure it out really, really quickly if it was a kid.
[208:57.52]Okay, remember the Lunchables pizzas?
[209:01.10]Imagine ordering a pizza from a restaurant and the Lunchables pizza comes out.
[209:06.74]That would be a bad business move.
[209:08.80]It would have to be stuff that would be easily hideable.
[209:17.04]4C.
[209:25.89]Yeah, you wouldn't be able to get away with the Lunchables deli meat stack circle things.
[209:32.73]It would have to be the chicken nuggets, kid cuisine, lean cuisine type stuff.
[209:40.35]The turkey dinner.
[209:41.39]They put the three or four slabs of turkey in the gravy.
[209:45.23]You could get away with that if you presented it correctly.
[209:59.24]A Jack and the Cho?
[210:03.12]Is this a fight?
[210:03.80]I think this is like a minute, like a hidden... Okay.
[210:14.05]I can't... Counter!
[210:15.67]He missed it.
[210:16.11]Kill him in one hit.
[210:16.97]Alright, what is it?
[210:18.39]What do I get?
[210:32.29]What's the point of that?
[210:32.93]Did you get anything?
[210:39.32]Nothing.
[210:41.14]It's just a mimic.
[210:42.88]I don't remember the last time I had one of those Thanksgiving dinner, microwaved, Lean Cuisine-esque TV dinners.
[211:08.70]Was it good?
[211:09.18]I don't remember.
[211:09.86]All I have in my mind, anytime I think of one of these TV dinners, is the taste of low-quality gravy.
[211:21.57]That's it.
[211:22.55]No other flavor comes to mind.
[211:23.81]Just kind of watery, low-quality gravy.
[211:31.10]And I'm talking not even for the Thanksgiving one.
[211:33.32]I'm talking even for the fried chicken one.
[211:39.94]Who can dig?
[211:45.52]Which one of them can dig?
[211:52.20]Oh, the plant.
[211:53.82]Plants aren't even here.
[212:08.47]Stouffers?
[212:11.03]Yeah, Stouffer's does have sort of just one flavor, doesn't it?
[212:16.59]All I think of is stuffing gravy taste.
[212:22.79]I'm thinking of the macaroni and cheese and all I think of is gravy stuffing.
[212:30.24]Stouffer's is just oven flavor.
[212:36.78]Why do I know what that means?
[212:40.17]I know what you mean by that.
[212:42.73]I understand what you're saying.
[212:47.32]It's oven flavored.
[212:55.58]Macaroni and gravy.
[213:00.34]Would you guys like to know what the best macaroni and cheese is?
[213:02.87]I can tell you.
[213:05.71]The best store of macaroni and cheese.
[213:16.76]No, it is not the yellow earwax mac and cheese.
[213:20.48]It's not that one.
[213:21.20]I'm not going to say the name.
[213:29.81]King's Fist.
[213:40.83]The best macaroni and cheese from the store that you can possibly buy.
[213:46.14]this Cracker Barrel.
[213:50.13]If you don't believe me, try the Cracker Barrel Challenge.
[214:05.12]It is the best that you can possibly buy.
[214:10.78]I do not take that lightly.
[214:20.96]Is this stream sponsored?
[214:21.96]No.
[214:22.34]This stream tells you real things that the streamer believes.
[214:25.24]None of this is paid for.
[214:44.83]If you don't, if you never had it before, just try it next time.
[214:48.45]Next time you're at the store or the grocery store, if it carries it, just try it.
[214:55.61]Make it on the stove.
[214:56.23]You have to make it on the stove.
[215:00.19]Try it.
[215:02.59]Come back and tell me that that was not in your top three grocery store mac and cheeses.
[215:12.69]If it was not in your top three grocery store mac and cheeses,
[215:18.17]then I will remove you from the channel.
[215:20.59]I will get you IP banned from my channel.
[215:23.63]I will remove your name.
[215:26.23]I will make sure that the name never pops up again.
[215:38.31]Now, I will respect your opinion, but... grunt.
[215:52.37]Cracker Barrel is my favorite.
[215:53.93]It's number one.
[215:54.71]It's my favorites in my pantry right now.
[215:56.27]Please don't ban me We don't have crappy US mac and cheese's over here mac and cheese is like as US American as you could possibly get Mac and cheese is
[216:21.81]American... Whoa.
[216:27.14]When am I gonna go on Hot Ones?
[216:30.12]I'm not fucking cool enough to go on Hot Ones, guys.
[216:34.24]I don't have enough clout to go on Hot Ones.
[216:36.00]What are you talking about?
[216:44.45]I can't go on Hot Ones, guys.
[216:45.75]I don't have an Instagram.
[216:51.09]I would have to make an Instagram and take a picture today and just post it there.
[216:57.71]I can't fly over that?
[217:03.53]So today we're going to be talking about what it's called, what's happened in that pic.
[217:07.71]And it seems that you have this Instagram picture here.
[217:09.92]We're going to go back to 2018, 2019.
[217:11.86]What is this?
[217:13.80]What happened here?
[217:14.54]I made that account like four days ago.
[217:17.70]And I took the picture because I knew that you were going to ask me a question about an Instagram picture.
[217:21.05]And that's the only one I got.
[217:22.33]It's me smiling with just like a gray backdrop behind me.
[217:29.54]Alright, man.
[217:30.12]Well, thanks for coming out here for Hot Ones.
[217:32.00]I actually like that show.
[217:33.80]It's not bad.
[217:44.85]How well would I do?
[217:45.65]I would do very well in that show.
[217:46.71]I wouldn't have any milk, wouldn't have any water.
[217:50.04]I would be completely fine.
[218:06.53]I would be perfectly fine.
[218:09.63]Says the guy with digestive problems.
[218:11.03]No, no, I mean, later I wouldn't be, but I wouldn't be like... I'd be fine.
[218:22.25]Where's the milk?
[218:27.37]That wouldn't happen.
[218:28.73]I'd be okay.
[218:39.55]What's going on with the internet here?
[218:42.46]Oh, no.
[218:46.98]Are we good?
[219:09.74]They have a hot ones.
[219:10.56]How come they don't have a cold ones?
[219:13.52]It starts off you drink like a room temperature water.
[219:18.45]And eventually it gets to like ice cream, popsicles, and then you get to like nitrogen.
[219:26.43]They do have that.
[219:27.29]No they don't.
[219:36.17]Dry ice.
[219:41.45]Everybody, okay.
[219:43.74]I know everyone's really obsessed with hot, hot sauce on their food, right?
[219:47.56]Hot, hot, hot.
[219:50.40]Yeah, yeah, but let me get some hot sauce on that sandwich.
[219:52.98]Let me get some hot... Frank's, Red Hot, whatever, right?
[219:57.80]Is there a reason why people aren't, like, nitrogen infusing their green beans?
[220:02.79]Why does it not go the other way?
[220:03.91]Why is it only hot?
[220:20.75]Because you can get hurt with nitrogen.
[220:23.35]You can get hurt with hot sauce, too.
[220:24.95]You eat like a hot California, whatever it is, Reaper.
[220:31.17]People have gone to the hospital because of that shit.
[220:44.63]Spicy is a flavor, cold is not.
[220:46.75]That's true, but how come somebody hasn't invented it?
[220:50.27]like in a lab somewhere, like cold as like a condiment.
[220:59.40]I can't keep that up, I'm sorry.
[221:00.62]There's only so far I can go.
[221:04.76]Menthol.
[221:06.62]Why are you not putting menthol on your French fries?
[221:23.35]Yeah, mint is called spice.
[221:24.87]That's true.
[221:31.03]Menthol mac and cheese.
[221:33.55]I... You might be onto something there.
[221:40.58]Oh, a spicy Italian sausage.
[221:42.92]No, menthol Italian sausage.
[221:58.10]That would be disgusting.
[221:59.82]That would be actually gross.
[222:16.64]That's some real hipster shit.
[222:22.54]Even I can't continue to talk about that shit.
[222:25.17]White pot.
[222:27.18]I have to draw the line at, like, we're just talking shit at menthol sausages.
[222:49.77]Can I please find this so I can level up my characters and do another... Come on.
[222:55.67]Before the stream ends, we need to see... Wind Lore... Spyro can't obtain any more traits.
[223:03.19]Abandoned Wind Lore.
[223:04.65]Uh-oh.
[223:06.35]What?
[223:08.57]How do I remove a trait?
[223:17.06]To remove Wind Lore?
[223:25.09]Inferno.
[223:26.99]Okay, good thing I just did that.
[223:29.82]Because I use fire on that character all the time.
[223:43.01]I just want to do the next tournament, but I have to find the lost people here.
[223:51.80]So Roberto can one-shot the boss and we can go and move on with our lives.
[224:20.04]What?
[224:21.97]Why is everybody freaking out?
[224:24.58]Why are you freaking out?
[224:30.94]I got Roberto here.
[224:31.96]He's got 500 attack power.
[224:32.86]And he's level 13.
[224:33.38]Earthlore.
[224:34.24]He doesn't know.
[224:53.84]He doesn't know.
[224:55.02]Neither do you.
[225:00.67]What's the percentage of the people that have even played this game before that are here?
[225:04.75]Don't ever get rid of lore.
[225:26.24]Bingo.
[225:27.54]I'm doing 250 to 500 damage a swing.
[225:31.56]And that's not even with my big move.
[225:34.12]And that's just pressing X. Okay, Blossom, what do you got?
[225:41.83]Ruby, that's a... How much longer till Roberto dies of old age very soon?
[225:55.09]So I'm saving the game at every point that I'm pretty much allowed to save.
[226:02.19]And when he dies, we're going to rewind time.
[226:06.16]And we're going to freeze him and fuse him probably with dragon.
[226:13.12]Maybe.
[226:21.31]You can call me scum if you want.
[226:22.47]That's fine.
[226:25.20]You can call me scum.
[226:42.19]Can you speak like Courage the Cowardly Dog?
[226:46.71]Courage does- doesn't Courage not talk?
[226:48.75]Doesn't he only just go like
[226:55.08]That's pretty much all he does, right?
[227:09.64]Oh, he talked to the camera.
[227:11.00]That's true.
[227:11.46]I don't even kind of... I can't really place what his voice sounds like.
[227:16.85]I got cute, and it's gonna be bad.
[227:30.33]Sorry, I just wanted to do 300 plus damage.
[227:34.23]We'll do it again.
[227:34.73]I'm gonna do as hard as I can.
[227:38.05]48 guts, watch this.
[227:38.67]That's it?
[227:54.54]Courage the Cowardly Dog.
[227:57.67]On Courage, the Cowardly Dog Show.
[228:08.14]Stop.
[228:09.82]Stop.
[228:10.44]I just want to get to the end.
[228:13.14]Stop.
[228:15.80]Stop this.
[228:16.56]No, don't.
[228:21.65]Stop.
[228:22.25]Stop.
[228:30.06]290.
[228:30.24]It's not enough.
[228:34.34]Everybody gets final guts with me.
[228:42.64]Nice.
[228:46.30]Good follow-up.
[228:59.43]Did I see the episode of Dexter's Lab when they swear?
[229:01.63]I don't think so.
[229:07.38]I don't think I've seen that.
[229:10.16]Can somebody search this?
[229:13.74]Somebody can here, right?
[229:17.32]Blossom can search, right?
[229:20.02]Investigate.
[229:21.06]What's in there?
[229:29.20]Okay, I don't want anyone to panic, but... I just took a sip out of my coffee.
[229:33.72]And there was something solid that I just swallowed.
[229:38.94]That was weird.
[229:47.92]I think I just swallowed a chicken bone.
[229:49.58]I think there's a chicken bone in my coffee.
[229:55.93]Don't you hate it when you have chicken bones in your coffee?
[230:01.69]This sucks.
[230:02.15]I don't want to look around here anymore.
[230:07.16]You just drank up a spider.
[230:10.02]My brother told me this.
[230:11.00]The only reason why I think about this is my brother told me a story.
[230:15.23]About how he did that.
[230:16.39]I can't even think about it.
[230:21.85]Oh, God.
[230:22.47]Okay.
[230:23.69]Can I even tell this story?
[230:24.69]It's so fucked up.
[230:25.51]It's just horrible.
[230:28.66]Ugh, it's making me, like, shiver.
[230:31.02]So, alright.
[230:31.72]If you're queasy about spiders and shit, mute the stream for, like, five minutes.
[230:37.01]Alright, here we go.
[230:37.67]Three, two, one.
[230:39.45]Hey, what's going on, guys?
[230:40.31]Welcome to the video.
[230:41.05]My name's Jerm.
[230:41.47]I got a story for you here.
[230:42.37]Uh, in the background here's gonna be some Monster Rancher 4.
[230:48.47]And it got me thinking.
[230:50.05]This one time that my brother told me the story...
[230:54.97]about how when he sucked up a spider through his straw, and... I'll tell it for you.
[231:00.69]Here we go.
[231:01.77]So, uh, my brother made coffee.
[231:05.12]It's like the similar situation.
[231:07.14]Oh my god, did I do that?
[231:12.02]Yeah, he made coffee in his coffee maker, which I did.
[231:15.92]And he had a glass and ice and coffee.
[231:20.80]And he was drinking his coffee.
[231:23.54]and he slurped up a super big solid object and he spit it out and it was a huge spider and he freaked out but I may have swallowed it I don't even want to think about that
[231:58.68]I hate the unknown.
[232:00.84]Stuff like that.
[232:01.38]Any time something like that happens, you just don't know.
[232:10.30]Whoa, what the hell was that?
[232:11.27]What could that have been?
[232:30.82]Don't worry, tomorrow you'll have powers.
[232:35.98]Ooh, this is a Tobita C!
[232:39.16]Okay.
[232:40.22]Oh, okay.
[232:41.43]This is the thing Chat was talking about.
[232:44.13]They said he doesn't know.
[232:52.52]Thank god, I've got the all-powerful Roberto.
[232:55.42]With his one-hit-kill moves.
[233:03.45]I can't wait to get a pastrami sandwich.
[233:07.44]Thunderlore!
[233:08.52]Abandon Thunderlore!
[233:25.72]Zap!
[233:28.61]I got a tablet!
[233:34.81]Hold on.
[233:35.25]What?
[233:36.11]Can I remove lore or something?
[233:38.31]What's going on here?
[233:39.59]I have to keep all these.
[233:44.04]Seriously, why do I have to have all these?
[233:47.82]I can't remove them.
[233:48.64]4C.
[233:49.12]What's the point of having all these traits if it fills a list and then you're stuck?
[234:15.71]Local bloomer can't read.
[234:16.90]No, I know I can remove them or not remove them, but let me... Can I just take the ones I don't want off?
[234:24.34]Not at the menu where I learned them?
[234:26.42]You can remove them at the ranch.
[234:27.48]Thank God.
[234:28.18]Uh-oh.
[234:39.63]Thank God.
[234:40.11]This is the thing that fucked it up last time.
[234:42.37]Didn't have Roberto, though.
[234:45.57]Alright.
[234:51.99]Come on Internet, stop it.
[234:54.73]You're starting to make me angry.
[235:02.64]I think this is the last place.
[235:05.34]Oh my goodness.
[235:16.43]This is a Jaguar.
[235:23.49]Thank God I've got Roberto.
[235:25.20]He's unstoppable.
[235:27.58]Get to A rank.
[235:32.44]How long is this game?
[235:33.34]It's kind of never-ending.
[235:38.63]I don't think the game ends.
[235:50.66]It's the seventh floor of this jungle.
[235:54.98]If you finish S rank, it ends.
[235:58.14]I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that, because Roberto's going to die.
[236:01.08]And then I'm going to have a new monster to try to play around with.
[236:13.13]Yeah, you can unmute.
[236:14.43]Yeah, unmute.
[236:17.57]Lifetab.
[236:18.03]Okay, cool.
[236:18.59]Tablets.
[236:19.13]More tablets.
[236:48.71]beat the game, dumpass to get S rank you need to fuse two A ranks so I have to get hold on so I need to fuse two A ranks so I have to get Roberto to A rank fuse him with
[237:09.28]the... dragon.
[237:10.46]Get the dragon to A, fuse two people together and get those to A, fuse them together and then bring those to... to S. Oh god, Criken just came in with a raid.
[237:26.35]Hello, everybody.
[237:28.01]Criken raid.
[237:28.65]Thanks a lot, Criken.
[237:31.21]Hope you had a good stream.
[237:33.63]Not sure what you were playing, but hope it was fun.
[237:36.82]Welcome, everybody.
[237:39.97]Oh god, I'm gonna die.
[237:41.25]Don't die.
[237:41.81]It'll actually kill him if he dies.
[237:44.01]No, don't counter it.
[237:45.01]Oh, this is bad.
[237:47.23]No!
[237:47.95]3 HP.
[237:48.99]Bring out somebody else.
[237:50.05]Anybody.
[237:50.59]Anyone.
[237:50.83]I don't care who it is.
[237:54.21]This'll kill him.
[237:54.75]He'll die.
[237:58.33]Come on.
[237:59.39]Not... Not a new audience coming in.
[238:02.48]Just kill him.
[238:04.50]Oh, this is fucking horrible.
[238:08.14]All of a sudden, everybody doesn't want to do any moves.
[238:09.52]Do you see this?
[238:13.68]Thank God.
[238:20.63]We're playing Monster Rancher 4.
[238:21.55]This is a game where you breed monsters.
[238:26.52]You put CDs in.
[238:28.32]And it pulls a random seed.
[238:30.82]And you can fuse them together, you can mess around with DNA.
[238:35.86]It's pretty interesting.
[238:39.29]Man, we can't go that way.
[238:46.36]I do not want you in the front now.
[238:48.68]Oh my god.
[238:49.28]Why are we getting so many of these random encounters?
[238:52.72]They're increased exponentially.
[238:59.73]Sorry, this thing sucks.
[239:04.87]No, it doesn't.
[239:05.61]I gotta do a different move.
[239:12.37]Where's my bite?
[239:17.16]Bawlish.
[239:18.70]Bawlish!
[239:19.40]Come on.
[239:20.12]Grave Throne.
[239:20.80]Bawlish!
[239:21.30]Again!
[239:21.82]Come on!
[239:23.94]Just hit it.
[239:32.43]Just let me end this encounter.
[239:34.25]I need to find these people here.
[239:47.66]Oh my god!
[239:49.15]No, please!
[239:52.09]This is really bad.
[239:53.03]There's a group of people on an expedition that I have to find down here, and for some reason... This won't let me leave this area.
[240:07.91]This is bad.
[240:19.61]Don't counter it.
[240:20.61]Thank God.
[240:24.65]Kill him.
[240:26.99]On 97 damage, that's it.
[240:28.37]Alright, that's a double team move.
[240:38.45]He should die from this.
[240:39.39]Yeah.
[240:46.06]Unless you knew he has a clip explaining who he is.
[240:52.31]Out of context.
[240:56.94]This looks way harder than it was last time.
[241:01.72]I can't even go this way.
[241:05.67]It's... I don't know if it's harder than it was last time.
[241:08.21]There's a lot of new mechanics that the game has thrown in.
[241:12.23]These counters can sometimes be pretty bullshit, but...
[241:26.67]Why are you linking all these?
[241:27.63]Are you trying to scare everybody away?
[241:30.75]Alright, I'm gonna pull Roberto back.
[241:43.00]No, I'm not.
[241:43.56]Bye.
[241:47.54]Now I might have to.
[241:50.63]This dragon's defense is so bad.
[241:52.93]His health is so bad.
[242:07.28]That was the Luigi side running move from Smash Bros.
[242:20.07]Your whole team is shit.
[242:26.74]All we need is one character to do anything good.
[242:35.50]Somebody just has to get to A rank.
[242:37.94]And then we fuse them with somebody else that's their friend.
[242:46.20]This is taking a long time.
[242:47.58]I'm on the seventh floor.
[242:48.64]How long have I been in here for?
[242:51.47]30, 40 straight minutes?
[242:52.03]I can't go this way.
[243:20.06]100 years.
[243:28.71]Switch back to Roberto.
[243:29.53]I mean, if I can get the damage here.
[243:31.19]Uh, maybe not.
[243:35.95]I'd like to have you level up.
[243:38.21]Come on, grab him.
[243:41.44]Alright.
[243:42.32]Fine, switch it out.
[243:47.07]Don't want him to kill.
[243:48.65]Alright, bring in Roberto.
[243:53.53]You wanna play that game?
[244:08.65]Don't let the spider bite your stomach.
[244:10.97]I added that.
[244:11.51]Somebody just said bite you.
[244:18.40]I miss Wall-E.
[244:21.20]Everybody misses Wall-E.
[244:22.80]But the problem is Wall-E, unfortunately, was not very good.
[244:36.09]So we had to freeze Wall-E.
[244:41.19]I just went in a circle.
[244:44.79]Where am I supposed to go?
[244:49.20]Oh, I could get up... up here?
[244:52.31]Alright, I made it.
[244:58.15]Thank God.
[245:04.13]Well, here's your beanbag, Sonic.
[245:08.41]Just huge this time, with an eye patch.
[245:15.18]Is he the one who kidnapped the folks around here?
[245:18.15]Wait, he's trying to tell me something.
[245:22.20]I know what you're up to.
[245:23.18]You're going to use that machine to alter us monsters.
[245:26.78]I know what evil you're up to.
[245:28.30]My altered arm is proof.
[245:31.15]Alter the monsters?
[245:32.21]No, we would never do such a thing.
[245:34.49]Silence.
[245:35.09]I can see through your plan.
[245:36.45]I've experienced far too much agony to stand by idly.
[245:40.36]I won't allow a single other monster to go through what I did.
[245:44.33]Please listen to us.
[245:45.47]We admit we use machines.
[245:46.73]We just, we use gadgets.
[245:49.35]But altering our monster friends?
[245:52.04]We would never, ever do that.
[245:53.56]Please believe me.
[245:55.52]Your words tell me nothing.
[245:57.26]We shall fight and I shall gaze into your soul.
[246:01.04]No, Fane, he refuses to listen.
[246:03.78]It's okay.
[246:04.30]We'll prove to him that Ryo's telling the truth by fighting.
[246:16.00]Yeah, let's fight him.
[246:17.08]Let's prove... Let's prove him right.
[246:30.53]Again.
[246:32.65]Chain it.
[246:32.95]Kill him.
[246:33.99]Not even fucking hard.
[246:34.87]Come on.
[246:37.09]Last hit.
[246:37.43]Get... I need last hit.
[246:38.45]Fire.
[246:38.75]Last hit.
[246:42.42]You can do it.
[246:47.46]Come on, fire last hit so you get the level up.
[246:59.84]Kill him, please.
[247:05.05]Don't, no, don't die!
[247:06.07]It's okay, we're gonna be fine.
[247:11.31]It's okay, the dragon died, but we're gonna get this last hit.
[247:14.45]Got it, game over, hard one.
[247:19.14]The dragon is... Earthlore.
[247:20.98]Mastered 10 out of 10.
[247:44.81]Please understand, we just want you to return the people you've kidnapped.
[247:48.31]We never meant to harm you.
[247:51.44]No matter.
[247:52.48]Let these wounds be a sign of the trust you earned.
[247:55.80]You need only to promise to me you will never alter monsters, and I will return all the people.
[248:01.40]We could never let a monster suffer!
[248:04.27]Ryo, you have great promise.
[248:06.45]The rest is up to you.
[248:07.61]Now I take my leave.
[248:10.27]Don, he looks so sad.
[248:11.97]Altering monsters, it's just wrong.
[248:14.60]Whoever did this won't get away with it.
[248:22.97]You beat me.
[248:23.73]You have my trust.
[248:25.07]You hurt me.
[248:29.31]Fuck this Garfield voice.
[248:32.31]Spyroid was injured.
[248:33.49]I'll send it to the hospital.
[248:38.53]I think we may have our priorities wrong here.
[248:44.13]I think Spyroid's dead.
[248:46.21]If Spyroid hasn't gotten better, I hope it comes back soon.
[248:49.07]Excuse me, hello.
[248:56.62]Oh, Cynthia, hello.
[248:58.38]I'm here with a delivery.
[248:59.48]It's a letter from Mr. Carnap.
[249:02.68]Let's see.
[249:03.98]Congratulations for saving the investigative team.
[249:06.39]As a thanks, I wish to offer you a gift.
[249:07.91]It's Monster Association Office.
[249:12.09]That's what it says.
[249:13.39]Let's go.
[249:33.85]Slowly, somehow.
[249:37.68]I slowly, somehow, unprover without doing anything turned into the second best monster I have.
[250:03.56]Okay.
[250:05.52]Spliceable Spleen, five community subs.
[250:07.36]Thank you, Spliceable Spleen.
[250:10.43]Thanks for dropping some subs here.
[250:14.41]Five from Spliceable Spleen.
[250:17.53]Thank you.
[250:19.09]What would I need to work on with you?
[250:24.16]What are your moves?
[250:25.84]Lot of intellect.
[250:28.34]Tons of intellect.
[250:30.42]Intellect defense.
[250:31.16]It's actually really good.
[250:33.68]Just do a bunch more intellect and... Intellect.
[250:38.77]Yeah.
[250:39.43]Read some books.
[250:39.91]Very balanced.
[250:58.39]Sandbag, yeah.
[251:01.51]Today you can do... probably life.
[251:06.29]Who cares what you do?
[251:15.50]Look at the... look at the stat gains on Unprover.
[251:18.06]That's ridiculous.
[251:20.07]Alright.
[251:20.43]I think there's a change of plan here.
[251:23.42]Unprover, that's the third or fourth in a row, more than 20 stat points.
[251:48.01]You deserve this.
[252:06.76]alright who else oh boy you're like starving um here have a have a banana
[252:26.39]Is the dragon gone?
[252:27.29]The dragon actually is gone.
[252:30.13]Tired, alright.
[252:37.98]Proceed.
[252:50.47]Town... Uh, we gotta go to town.
[252:54.45]Dissociation, let's finally get out of this rank.
[253:10.19]Ah, it's you!
[253:10.79]I have something for you.
[253:13.85]And it's this, a Breeders' Rank B certificate.
[253:17.68]Now you can proudly enter the IMA competition in Torval.
[253:21.98]And the IMA competition is as much as I hate to admit it, a tougher than our FIMBA competition.
[253:35.35]Everybody fucking hates this.
[253:37.47]Hmm, what's wrong, Rio?
[253:38.35]Is that taking up?
[253:40.15]Mr. Carnap, I have you heard of altered monsters.
[253:42.77]They're monsters with machines grafted to them.
[253:46.67]No, I can't say that I have.
[253:49.26]I like to fiddle with machines, but I could never imagine meddling machine with monster.
[253:55.02]Goodness gracious, I'm so busy.
[253:56.68]I've got to get going now.
[253:57.84]Ta-ta!
[254:00.88]He's gone.
[254:02.66]That seems strange.
[254:05.49]Goodbye.
[254:06.09]Oh, where's Mr. Carnap?
[254:08.19]Ophelia, glad to have run into you.
[254:09.49]There's something I wanted to ask you.
[254:13.27]So that guy's evil.
[254:14.21]He's definitely manipulating monsters and grafting hooks on them and stuff like a fucking psycho.
[254:20.21]Well, that's the situation.
[254:21.33]Do you know anything about it?
[254:23.30]Monster alterations.
[254:25.48]I've never heard of such a thing.
[254:27.30]How cruel.
[254:28.52]How awful.
[254:30.90]Like, not awful at all is breeding monsters and forcing them to fight each other for your own personal gain.
[254:42.98]But that's okay.
[254:43.76]That's fine.
[254:46.26]How cruel.
[254:51.11]Freezing them in canisters.
[254:54.31]And stuffing their DNA into each other until you get what you want, so it can fight in a tournament for you.
[255:04.57]Okay.
[255:07.61]Nendoro's arm was altered.
[255:09.56]I don't know who did it, but somebody surely did.
[255:12.97]Hmm, why don't you try Torble?
[255:15.31]That town is on the forefront of technology.
[255:18.69]You might be able to find some clues there.
[255:22.46]Torble?
[255:22.82]Oh, alright.
[255:28.52]Fuck, softlocked.
[255:30.56]Uh-oh.
[255:32.02]Shit, for those of you guys that came over from KrakenStream, if you don't save every fucking single time, you get a softlock scenario, which we're in right now.
[255:44.11]God damn it.
[255:49.40]Well, I mean, I don't know what the last time I saved it.
[255:51.26]Let me try something here.
[255:52.00]I'm going to try to like blow into the microphone and see if it helps.
[255:58.03]It's a long shot, but we'll see.
[256:00.63]One, two, three.
[256:24.97]Spyroid hasn't gotten better.
[256:27.89]That's not good.
[256:28.45]This is actually... I think Spyroid might actually die.
[256:38.84]I mean, he did get one hit KO'd.
[256:43.45]He got the hook dug into his skull.
[256:51.43]So...
[256:54.64]We've got a new favorite best friend!
[256:58.94]Unprover!
[257:08.41]Intelligence again.
[257:15.01]I'm gonna try to get intelligence to like 300.
[257:18.27]Everything else is perfect.
[257:19.45]The health is fine.
[257:26.10]What about Blossom?
[257:29.62]Tired, yeah.
[257:30.20]Rest.
[257:31.47]Sandbag.
[257:38.43]Adrock is so bad.
[257:39.65]Has Adrock ever had a stat increase that was more than 8?
[257:43.47]I don't think it's ever happened.
[257:54.72]Come on, stop, stop kinking my hose, internet.
[257:59.08]Somebody's like going to my internet and just like kinking the hose.
[258:32.31]I love when this thing rests.
[258:34.99]It just locks on its back.
[258:37.73]Come here.
[258:38.39]Let's give you a... Some more chocolate!
[258:55.68]What the hell?
[259:00.52]What the fuck?
[259:02.33]Stop this nonsense!
[259:11.22]Uh... I... I... Apparently I'm still alive.
[259:19.51]Weird.
[259:19.83]I don't know why this fucking happens, man.
[259:22.33]It really is almost like somebody steps on the wire.
[259:32.61]It should be live still.
[259:34.27]It doesn't say it's off.
[259:41.46]I think I am.
[259:42.26]It should still be live.
[259:53.18]Well, I'm gonna have to send another message.
[259:58.37]Because this has been happening the last, like, four or five streams, right?
[260:01.53]We just hit, like, this patch for, like, an hour.
[260:05.61]It just dumps on itself.
[260:13.52]Well.
[260:17.50]Yeah, it's all over the place.
[260:26.28]Lively good.
[260:29.00]What about you?
[260:29.72]Frustrated, but you're going to be fine.
[260:38.55]Wait, is it the Twitch servers?
[260:41.33]Is Twitch having problems today?
[260:43.17]No, I don't think so.
[261:13.33]Yeah, you may have to refresh.
[261:15.62]Because it's kind of... This is just weird.
[261:21.34]It's like a surge.
[261:23.10]Because I'm getting... I have my cap, my bitrate cap is at 6,000.
[261:30.72]It's like electrically surging through my internet because like, okay, so 6,000 is my cap for upload.
[261:37.27]And this shit is going to like 12, 15,000 up.
[261:38.73]Like 12,000 up.
[261:39.43]And then dumping down to like 500.
[261:41.19]That's weird.
[262:00.15]Like, OBS shouldn't even be allowing this to go past, like, 10,000.
[262:03.84]Why is it at 12,000?
[262:04.50]Like, right now it says I'm streaming at, like, 9,000 up, which is... What?
[262:13.88]I have a cap at 6,000 here.
[262:16.76]What the hell is this doing?
[262:26.12]That's very odd.
[262:29.29]Oh, sorry this is happening.
[262:34.74]Really?
[262:35.04]Is something else in all the people?
[262:36.28]What's this?
[262:41.30]Is that wit?
[262:44.06]Huh, Fane?
[262:45.92]I never thought I'd see you here.
[262:47.18]How are you doing?
[262:48.91]Just fine.
[262:49.41]And you?
[262:50.83]Me?
[262:51.09]Well, a day hasn't passed that I didn't recall the events of that day.
[262:59.10]It won't help anything, but let me say I'm sorry.
[263:03.12]Oh, it's alright.
[263:03.60]Don't worry about it.
[263:04.74]I've eaten.
[263:06.20]I've even managed to become an official breeder.
[263:11.63]Really?
[263:11.95]Congratulations!
[263:12.63]You did it!
[263:14.37]Oh, if you have to ask something, come to the university.
[263:16.71]I work there.
[263:18.77]I'm willing to help you out if you need it.
[263:20.43]Well, I must be going.
[263:21.43]Bye!
[263:24.37]Is he a friend of yours?
[263:26.49]Something happened between you guys?
[263:27.83]You're acting different than you did when you met Graham and Filia.
[263:31.47]Yeah, I guess a little something did happen.
[263:33.01]But it's all in the past now.
[263:34.39]Rio, let's go to the university later.
[263:35.93]Alright, I need to... What's in the inn?
[263:44.70]What are you gonna do?
[263:46.50]Ooh.
[263:47.28]New store?
[263:49.12]Watermelon, peach... Beef, chocolate, canned fuel!
[263:54.09]Solid fuel in a can.
[263:57.55]Honey toast.
[264:00.51]Uh, get a couple of carrots.
[264:08.78]That's such a weird number to stop at for drop frames.
[264:18.60]I'm at 10,000 even drop frames.
[264:23.62]It's very odd.
[264:29.86]Peaches, mangoes, watermelon... Uh, how much is... Beef is $500 here.
[264:34.32]That's kind of a rip-off.
[264:38.52]What does the fuel do?
[264:52.92]Is the fuel like the... energy drinks?
[264:56.07]Or energy bars?
[264:59.81]Where if I feed it to them, it pumps them up and it takes their lifespan away?
[265:03.71]Or is it better?
[265:17.85]I'm trying to do this like x5 speed apparently It's entirely feasible that somebody has already done some experimentation in monster alteration
[265:48.24]But that's too cruel.
[265:49.66]That may be, but that's the reality of this town.
[265:54.29]You'll see once you enter the competition.
[265:57.51]It's no walk in the daisies, but I don't expect a Fimba breeder will have much of a chance.
[266:04.21]Thanks for the advice, but I have no choice.
[266:05.95]I've got to enter the competition and find out.
[266:09.00]Well, then first you've got to go to the association and register for the competition.
[266:12.70]Yeah.
[266:13.96]Go to the Torble Monster Association next week.
[266:17.90]I'll mention you.
[266:18.48]Well, don't even tell me we're gonna have to do a thing where... TT, you called Master Wit?
[266:20.76]Do you have visitors?
[266:29.24]Oh - has always been celebrated.
[266:35.24]What the heck are you doing in that gettup? And since when did you talk so politely?
[266:40.24]Why you- I oughtta. I mean shoot! How very unkind of me.
[266:45.58]I happen to be very proud of Master Wit's abilities, and that's why I became his assistant.
[266:50.50]So if you're done, please get the heck... I mean, kindly take your leave, hm?
[266:56.33]You're talking funny.
[266:59.33]Please mention us at the association.
[267:01.65]Don't tell me I have to go, like, on another one of these missions.
[267:04.39]What is this guy?
[267:05.57]What brings you here today?
[267:06.61]Uh, command?
[267:11.47]He sees a very promising boy, but he's just a bit too serious.
[267:15.05]If he lightened up a bit, new worlds would open up for him.
[267:21.03]Come back anytime, okay?
[267:23.60]So come back next week, but what if... I'm gonna have to go to another one of these adventure things and do a mission.
[267:35.77]It's gonna be such a pain.
[267:45.17]Spyroid has come home from the hospital.
[267:52.84]Not dead.
[267:59.46]Not dead, but we got this other good shit going on here.
[268:05.77]Let's see if you can catch up.
[268:16.33]Sandbag.
[268:17.73]You can do... can you do... life?
[268:20.70]No, you can do defense.
[268:24.36]You can do target.
[268:25.06]Okay, that looks good.
[268:27.06]If we got another 20 plus increase from Unprover, then... I mean, nah.
[268:33.14]Fuck everybody else.
[268:47.71]the Intelligence stat increase.
[268:49.15]I can get that to like 500.
[268:49.89]So we're probably gonna end up fusing these two together then, because the stats are gonna be so much better.
[269:07.70]I'm sorry.
[269:08.06]You're cool and all, but you just... You haven't been improving as much as the Unprover has.
[269:12.92]It's a weird sentence.
[269:31.96]Frustrated.
[269:32.58]You'll be alright.
[269:33.20]Okay, what's coming up?
[269:41.11]Town, right?
[269:43.75]Let's go to the... get our association.
[269:55.40]You're a Fimba breeder.
[269:56.50]I'm sorry, but I think it may be too difficult for you at your level.
[270:00.28]But of course, you're welcome to enter.
[270:02.63]It was a pain to get into the ribbon competition, but it's easy here in Torbol.
[270:06.99]Yes, you know, there's been a spike in the stray monster population in Torbol.
[270:11.24]Since we have that problem on our hands, there's hardly a time to test competition applicants.
[270:15.98]Sorry.
[270:16.34]It's not a problem, but why are all the stray monsters here?
[270:21.12]It's a side effect of overbearing training and machine-based methods.
[270:26.93]Many monsters run away, and injured monsters are often abandoned.
[270:31.34]Oh, I shouldn't talk about such gloomy matters before the competition.
[270:34.02]I'm so sorry.
[270:34.70]Uh... Nothing gloomy about it.
[270:42.92]It's a fabulous story, I must say.
[270:44.58]He's the asshole.
[270:46.82]Is that Fane I see here?
[270:50.31]Oh, you live in Torbol, don't you?
[270:51.83]Your father is a top-ranking Aima official, right?
[270:56.65]An elite Aima official, thank you very much.
[270:58.57]Let's get it right, pal.
[271:01.79]You can't be serious about entering the IMA competition.
[271:04.53]Have you lost your marbles?
[271:07.20]What?
[271:08.46]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[271:08.90]I didn't mean to say that out loud.
[271:11.38]To make it up to you, why not stop by and see my fabulous ranch?
[271:18.20]Just look at these.
[271:19.20]The latest training gadgets.
[271:20.54]More than 60 monsters.
[271:22.08]And if you can't take the training regimen, well then, poof, you get axed.
[271:28.54]Maximum efficiency only made possible by my maximum wealth.
[271:32.75]The best ranch in Aima, no, make that the world.
[271:38.55]Axe, what do you think monsters are?
[271:42.69]They're not replaceable cogs in some machine.
[271:45.54]The best ranch, you've got to be kidding.
[271:48.86]Oh, for heaven's sake.
[271:50.20]I know you're jealous, Fane, but don't get mad at me just because you lack the means to run things like me.
[271:56.83]Besides, you're really only wasting your time if you deal with stragglers!
[271:59.47]They're not- He got real angry real quick.
[272:03.79]They're not worth a grain of salt.
[272:09.21]Fain, I'm sorry.
[272:14.43]Eek.
[272:17.11]Oof, you- She punched me, she punched me right in the face.
[272:31.39]Not even daddy punches me, what?
[272:34.41]This girl is your responsibility, make her say she's sorry.
[272:38.93]Nobody needs to apologize to you, I feel exactly the way Ryo does.
[272:43.49]I'll defeat you in battle and prove to you that your monster's methods don't make a good monster.
[272:53.41]Alright, let's go sign up and one hit KO all his monsters.
[273:03.80]That guy looked like you.
[273:04.76]No, it didn't.
[273:12.55]February, week one.
[273:14.79]Hello, is anybody home?
[273:17.33]More of this exposition.
[273:19.13]Oh, hi, TT.
[273:20.09]You're still wearing that getup, aren't you?
[273:22.11]I'm disguised.
[273:22.97]I'm trying to get more info in Intel.
[273:24.97]Oh, you hush.
[273:25.53]This is what Master likes.
[273:27.81]I wear it to show Master my affections and don't give me the third degree.
[273:32.37]I didn't say anything bad about it, so would... You're here for a reason.
[273:36.47]Of course I am.
[273:37.32]Master wants you to come to the university.
[273:41.72]Shoot, why do I have to come to your ranch on an errand?
[273:44.70]Well, you got the message, so I'm out of here.
[273:46.58]Hmm.
[273:49.00]Okay, okay, okay.
[273:49.58]Jeez, guess I'll pay a visit to the Torrible University soon.
[273:56.91]Hello, how are things?
[273:57.73]Need anything today?
[273:58.61]Go ahead, take a look around.
[273:59.57]Yes.
[274:01.13]Appraise.
[274:02.63]Which would you appraise?
[274:04.00]The life tablet.
[274:08.62]It's the first time I've appraised this training gadget.
[274:10.48]Apparently this training gadget is called a rodeo.
[274:14.08]I'll add this to your training gadget list.
[274:16.95]I also have an old tablet.
[274:22.02]This... It's the first time I've appraised this training gadget.
[274:25.59]Apparently this training gadget is called a cannon.
[274:28.99]I'll add this to your training gadget list.
[274:31.31]Cannon.
[274:39.72]Sandbag, book, target, trampoline.
[274:42.82]Cannon.
[274:46.60]So you shoot yourself with a cannon to improve defense.
[274:58.75]Let's get it on there.
[275:00.87]Oh damn, that's a long way.
[275:03.52]Okay.
[275:03.82]And what was the other one?
[275:06.24]Rodeo, level 3.
[275:07.86]This is life.
[275:31.72]rodeo okay is that all like that's all I got right anything else I think that's it wait hold on uh by effect you don't have any praise to now okay I think that's it
[276:03.54]Spyroid and Roberto will make the better fusion.
[276:05.82]You don't want your fusion inheriting that it hates to battle, which Unprover does.
[276:13.29]This is true.
[276:15.43]So I'll just keep you around and maybe level you up.
[276:20.90]Alright, are they friends yet?
[276:22.62]Like, really good friends?
[276:23.54]They're just good friends, not great friends.
[276:31.98]Okay.
[276:32.90]Let me see the calendar.
[276:33.90]No.
[276:39.42]Come on.
[276:39.96]Where's the official tournament?
[276:44.17]You're killing me with this.
[276:44.91]I have to go back to town or something and talk to the university again?
[276:53.71]Well, stay with the book.
[276:55.15]You do not the Lifeblade.
[276:56.83]This time you're going to do the Rodeo.
[277:02.42]This is gonna be really funny looking.
[277:03.72]Uh, and you... Do the sandbag.
[277:09.45]You can do the target, that's fine.
[277:16.23]Do the book?
[277:16.85]Okay.
[277:25.00]20 intelligence.
[277:26.22]Minus 3 intelligence!
[277:30.82]Oh, that's a drawback.
[277:38.74]That's so stupid I need a better view You're doing fine You need to eat Have some beef
[278:12.02]He loves it.
[278:12.76]He's having so much fun.
[278:13.74]Okay, you can... I'll just feed you.
[278:29.11]Give you something quick.
[278:31.59]Like a carrot.
[278:32.61]What the hell are you guys linking?
[278:43.34]Oh my god.
[278:49.03]My face doesn't even fit.
[278:54.51]It's not even my hair.
[278:56.15]My ears aren't that big.
[279:03.50]Alright, go to town.
[279:08.92]Torable University.
[279:12.15]Please let me, before Roberto dies, get him to A rank.
[279:23.36]Things got out of hand.
[279:25.20]Yeah, a little.
[279:25.80]He had it coming, though.
[279:27.82]Yeah, I know what you mean, but he's strong.
[279:30.30]You can't beat him with standard training gadgets.
[279:34.16]We must beat him with normal raising techniques.
[279:37.37]In that case, at the very least, you'll have to upgrade the training gadgets at your ranch.
[279:42.68]I'll teach you how to assign effects to gadgets.
[279:45.26]Use this metal.
[279:49.86]What are you thinking?
[279:50.44]There's no need to extend your hand to him.
[279:53.50]Here, use this cannon.
[279:56.99]Doping.
[280:02.01]You can make gadgets with the magic effect.
[280:04.25]The name doesn't sound too nice, but it works fabulously.
[280:06.81]Give it a try.
[280:08.25]Thanks.
[280:08.91]Gadgets with effects.
[280:09.93]I'll see how it works.
[280:12.87]Just what is the deal?
[280:15.29]Have you gone out of your skull, Wit?
[280:18.01]I mean, er, are you sure this is a good idea, Master?
[280:20.19]I told you.
[280:22.76]Oh, Errol, what brings you here today?
[280:24.62]But I can say this to you, that Wit, you see, is a very promising boy.
[280:30.34]But it's such a bit too serious, if he liked that a bit, you wouldn't know it for him.
[280:36.49]Get me the fuck out of here.
[280:41.43]You know, that was as close to a Donald Duck as I probably could possibly do.
[280:47.87]That's very close to Donald Duck.
[280:49.32]That would be an interesting take on Donald.
[281:02.53]If I go so overboard with that, it turns into Donald Duck.
[281:15.57]Fan- Torval Competition.

[294:06.83]Here we go.
[294:09.51]14, 16.
[294:20.61]That's not even a good increase.
[294:25.71]Really.

[294:50.73]OK, here.
[294:51.25]Come here.
[294:57.63]Have a banana.
[294:59.63]I don't want bananas.

[295:29.58]Uh... I have not ever done that.
[295:35.48]And I fucking read it!
[295:36.40]I'm so... Oh my god.
[295:38.78]I don't know why I do that.
[295:40.00]I'm sorry.
[295:40.58]I keep just reading the gross comments.
[295:45.49]I seriously don't know what's wrong with me.
[295:51.26]Truly.
[296:00.57]Like, am I reading that?
[296:01.77]Is it, oh yeah, that's like weird and strange.
[296:03.91]Maybe that might be funny or something.
[296:05.59]I don't know why I keep just instinctively reading these.
[296:08.17]That's a long way away.
[296:31.81]How does a floating wolf armor go to the bathroom?
[296:44.96]Holy shit, that was 27 intellect.
[296:49.13]That's insane.
[296:54.66]You deserve food for that one.
[296:56.86]You deserve- not only do you deserve food, you des- You deserve salmon.
[297:02.31]You deserve a salmon for that one.
[297:04.27]Nice work.
[297:08.57]He didn't like it.
[297:09.11]What an asshole.
[297:17.44]That shit's like fucking $40 a pound.
[297:38.50]It's dead.
[297:39.59]Everything this character does looks dead.
[297:41.71]There we go!
[297:52.43]Who gave Blossom LSD?
[297:58.26]Uh...

[298:23.65]Rodeo.
[298:25.33]No, life blade.
[298:26.19]I don't want to drop you that much.
[298:29.27]Sandbag, that's good.
[298:30.29]You can rest today.
[298:32.70]You can get in the tub.
[298:36.38]See what we get this time.
[298:43.00]Another 27.
[298:47.21]I need to really just start putting in a tournament.
[298:51.01]What is he, almost 300 or 400 intelligence?
[298:52.27]299 intelligence.
[299:12.54]It's pretty great.
[299:23.12]Hungry?
[299:26.04]Alright.
[299:36.26]Just get Roberto to the tournament.
[299:39.01]That's all I care about.
[299:41.86]How you doing over here?
[299:42.70]You okay?
[299:44.40]Not really.
[299:45.38]How many carrots?
[299:46.02]I don't have any carrots left.
[299:53.71]Hydrate?
[299:54.29]I got water right here.
[300:14.85]I don't think we've even seen that character do a move.
[300:23.46]Alright, I gotta save it here.
[300:27.72]First week of spring.
[300:29.12]Save the game.
[300:32.44]We're very close to Roberto's death.
[300:47.20]Hit the book again.
[300:51.02]Then you can rest.
[300:54.34]You hit the life blade again.
[300:58.32]You hit the... No, you rest.
[301:01.85]You... Hit the... Hmm... Cannon.
[301:11.21]You rest.
[301:13.49]Making quesadillas?
[301:14.19]Quesadillas are amazing.
[301:20.11]Uh, that plus 9 defense with minus 3 accuracy.
[301:36.47]You just let the cannon hit you in the ass?
[301:38.91]I don't understand how this builds defense.
[301:46.76]I mean, maybe...
[301:54.87]Hey good work getting shot at by a cannon You're so good at that
[302:40.50]I didn't want to, like, just do gross mouth noises.
[302:44.96]Hey, streamer, what's up?
[302:45.59]Can you do your famous Thanos impression?
[302:47.01]Yeah, sure.
[302:47.41]Very frustrated here.
[303:09.54]Gross mouth Thanos.
[303:12.86]Did I?
[303:13.39]Were there gross mouth noises there?
[303:14.91]I... I'm sorry if there were.
[303:18.79]Were there mouth noises?
[303:24.27]You hungry still?
[303:34.40]How about a... a mango?
[303:46.41]Tired.
[303:46.83]Alright, let's keep going.
[303:50.40]Don't die yet.
[303:52.88]Only a couple... Two or three more weeks, I think.
[303:56.66]No!
[303:59.68]Oh.
[304:02.24]This rank is getting too easy for this monster.
[304:04.44]It needs new challenges.
[304:05.54]It could be a good time for a fresh start.
[304:18.00]Roberto hates resting.
[304:19.25]Why am I doing this to him?
[304:20.13]Because you have to sleep.
[304:21.65]When you're tired, you don't... Does he just stand in the corner?
[304:24.33]Okay, rest.
[304:31.65]Rest.
[304:33.34]Sandbag.
[304:35.74]Here it is, up here.
[304:36.54]This is the one that matters.
[304:38.08]As long as you live for the next one, one, two, three, four, five, six weeks...
[304:44.66]We'll be good to go.
[304:45.62]And we'll finally get to A rank.
[304:47.62]And that will have beat the game.
[304:48.80]But not really.
[304:49.44]That's a lie.
[304:50.10]It was just, you know, close enough, as they say.
[305:02.10]Why have I not put anybody else in tournaments for eight months?
[305:05.40]Well, because... Monster Rancher 4...
[305:09.39]is hard to manage because I have five monsters.
[305:14.12]Each monster has to do three tournaments each to rank up.
[305:21.12]So that's three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen tournaments to be able to be allowed to rank up to just to get to D rank.
[305:30.06]So I kind of have to pick a couple that I care about.
[305:32.93]And the other ones are just DNA bait for a while while they sit on the ranch.
[305:40.15]It's a lot of management.
[305:43.70]And I've been told by an expert Monster Rancher player.
[305:45.94]He told me that usually you want to focus on one or two, and the rest are just adventure bait.
[306:02.06]He also told me I got one guide.
[306:04.19]It's not that hard to get to S rank.
[306:05.53]I thought somebody lied to me.
[306:24.80]You're just doing okay.
[306:26.56]Here, have some food.
[306:28.90]Have a mango.
[306:38.74]How are you?
[306:39.22]You're... you're doing alright.
[306:48.29]S rank is actually easier to get to than A and B rank were.
[306:51.94]Really.
[306:56.40]Well, I'll be at A rank very, very soon.
[306:59.20]Hopefully he can live long enough.
[307:01.35]Is there a way that I can prolong his life to make it so he can do S rank?
[307:06.13]Or is he just gonna die? ...
[307:20.15]Yeah, freeze him.
[307:25.49]What if I just feed him nice beef every day?
[307:28.50]Will he live?
[307:36.78]But, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[307:38.46]Is it true?
[307:39.44]Tell me if this is a false thing or not.
[307:41.93]If I freeze him and combine him with somebody else, he will stay at A rank.
[307:46.07]Is that true?
[307:46.57]Or is that a lie?
[307:49.05]Is that for real?
[307:53.85]The thing that comes out will be A rank.
[307:58.43]That's a half-truth.
[307:59.64]What does that mean?
[308:09.08]You have to combine it with another A rank.
[308:12.42]Okay.
[308:13.46]Okay.
[308:27.63]Alright.
[308:28.49]Schedule again.
[308:31.35]You're going to... What are you at?
[308:32.67]Yeah.
[308:34.53]Get that magic book.
[308:36.84]Just become unstoppable.
[308:40.10]Let's do... Lifeblade.
[308:46.50]Rest.
[308:46.90]No, you don't need to rest.
[308:47.90]Training.
[308:50.63]What are you at now?
[308:51.67]Tired.
[308:52.09]Fullness.
[308:53.77]Uh, maybe... get on the rodeo.
[308:55.99]Let's see a little bit of a health increase.
[308:59.65]Rest and then sandbag.
[309:00.79]Okay, let's go.
[309:09.58]23 life, minus 3 intelligence.
[309:10.71]I don't really use it at all, so it's not a big deal.
[309:24.45]I might need to buy some more food here in a minute.
[309:29.27]Thanks for the stream.
[309:29.87]Hey, thanks for coming up.
[309:34.33]Glad you like the stream.
[309:36.47]Thank you.
[309:38.86]Uh, you're okay.
[309:41.14]You're okay.
[309:41.66]You can eat, though.
[309:53.93]Okay, let's also praise you you're doing a great job Sleepy over here.
[310:10.65]You're fine It's inevitable it's gonna happen real soon
[310:25.65]I'm paranoid at that death.
[310:34.08]Two things.
[310:34.42]Roberto can live another year if you're lucky.
[310:37.60]It should only require... It should only require only one monster to keep rank, but in four, I'm not so sure.
[310:43.42]But I think it still holds true.
[310:45.24]I suggest not taking Roberto into the dungeon again, as he could die as soon as the dungeon ends.
[310:53.85]Definitely duly noted here.
[310:59.13]Do the book again.
[310:59.71]Then you can rest here.
[311:04.99]Black blade.
[311:08.69]You're doing well, okay.
[311:09.95]Tub.
[311:11.50]Yeah, I don't like the defense thing.
[311:13.28]Didn't really work out for you last time.
[311:14.74]Rest.
[311:14.84]27.
[311:14.86]17. 17.
[311:34.04]The final dungeon is an hour long and it sucks.
[311:36.70]My monster died of old age as soon as the dungeon ended.
[311:40.11]That kind of sucks.
[311:59.50]End of video.
[311:59.88]Who was hungry?
[312:00.38]Somebody else was hungry, weren't they?
[312:03.88]You're kind of hungry.
[312:04.88]What about you?
[312:05.26]I have another beef.
[312:09.60]That's the last one I got.
[312:10.44]That wasn't enough?
[312:23.41]How is that not enough food?
[312:24.29]That was a piece of meat.
[312:36.10]Okay.
[312:36.36]Let me check their stats here.
[312:42.11]That screen is killing me!
[312:43.49]It's like being underwater and opening your eyes.
[312:47.23]He's almost at 400 intelligence.
[313:02.13]He hates mangos!
[313:08.58]Well, that's all we got.
[313:14.36]Stop feeding unprover mangoes.
[313:16.54]He hates them.
[313:25.73]Well, what does he like?
[313:27.55]Squid?
[313:27.99]Rest.
[313:31.13]And then magic book.
[313:40.90]What?
[313:41.32]No.
[313:41.66]No, no, no, no, no.
[313:44.30]No, no!
[313:54.36]God damn it, you have a tournament in like two days.
[314:09.43]The menus... Just click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[314:13.14]Sometimes you just accidentally hit the wrong button.
[314:15.80]Okay, thank God it's not today.
[314:22.82]Two days.
[314:24.70]Two weeks.
[314:42.77]Everything requires a confirmation.
[314:44.29]I feel like I'm using Windows.
[314:50.57]Yes, run as administrator, please.
[314:52.25]Can I run this game as administrator and not have to do this?
[314:58.13]Alright, here we go.
[315:03.58]Sleep.
[315:05.06]Sleep.
[315:11.68]Rest.
[315:12.12]Do not do anything today at all.
[315:16.09]You can do... something.
[315:18.37]How about... How about accuracy?
[315:22.35]And you can go in front of the cannon.
[315:36.74]Whoa, whoa, what?
[315:38.14]What happened?
[315:39.72]What happened?
[315:40.10]It's a plus three!
[315:43.18]What?
[315:44.44]What was wrong?
[315:46.80]Hey, you want a mango?
[316:01.52]He doesn't hate- Okay, did I just give him something he doesn't like even more than a mango?
[316:07.62]He doesn't like- He likes- He hates fucking bananas.
[316:18.81]It's ranked from top to bottom, isn't it?
[316:20.63]The stats are way too high for his rank.
[316:30.83]Well, let me just take him into the tournament.
[316:32.51]I don't want to do three garbage can tournaments to be able to prove that he's ready to go.
[316:36.63]Alright, you go to tournament.
[316:49.64]Why did you buy so many mangoes?
[316:51.08]I don't know.
[316:51.50]They looked cool.
[316:56.75]Alright.
[316:57.09]No, it's tomorrow.
[317:00.67]Not this week, next week.
[317:02.73]It's the official B cup.
[317:05.50]To move on to A. And then freeze them.
[317:08.96]Yeah.
[317:13.72]No.
[317:13.86]Buy some more food.
[317:35.46]By the way, are you raising any mochi at the ranch?
[317:39.86]No, no mochi at the ranch.
[317:41.82]Hmm, really?
[317:42.34]Well, then forget it.
[317:44.51]Why do you ask?
[317:46.09]Well, something is up.
[317:48.57]Recently we've experienced these odd incidents.
[317:50.65]Mochi are disappearing.
[317:51.65]Okay.
[317:56.27]They walk off in the night as if something is beckoning them.
[318:00.89]A number of the customers here have lost their mochi recently.
[318:05.47]Mochi are so affectionate to humans.
[318:06.87]Why on Earth would they run away?
[318:09.24]Yeah, that's just it.
[318:10.08]And mochi are the only kind disappearing.
[318:13.62]Have you had any problems at your ranch, Rio?
[318:16.30]Hmm.
[318:17.50]No, but we don't have any mochi, so that may be why we're doing okay.
[318:22.74]Well, okay.
[318:23.10]In that case, don't worry about it.
[318:25.04]I'll be sure to tell you if there are any updates.
[318:27.82]Yes, please do.
[318:34.76]Alright.
[318:36.06]Give me... Give me like five... Give me ten carrots.
[318:42.49]Give me... Three watermelons.
[318:47.73]Give me... Five beeves.
[318:53.21]And that's it.
[319:10.16]What's- what is a mochi?
[319:19.64]Week three, spring, cool.
[319:23.02]Uh, hello.
[319:25.46]Oh, Philia, hello.
[319:27.49]Oh, who's that with you?
[319:28.47]Oh yeah, I had regenerated Ariel, a new friend.
[319:33.01]A mochi!
[319:35.01]It's so soft and nice to touch.
[319:37.71]Won't you try petting it?
[319:39.85]No thanks.
[319:41.81]When it comes to mochi, Fain acts strange.
[319:45.29]Just like at the restaurant.
[319:47.47]Why do you avoid mochi?
[319:48.75]Are we eating these animals?
[319:52.14]Am I allergic to mochi?
[319:53.26]I don't get it.
[319:55.84]You could tell, huh?
[319:57.74]A long time ago, I had a mochi.
[319:59.26]I had no parents, so it was my only friend.
[320:03.06]I took my mochi around, acting like a real breeder, showing it off to everybody.
[320:07.59]And I didn't even notice how exhausted my mochi was.
[320:11.23]One time I was out with my mochi who didn't want to be out at all when we were attacked by a stray monster.
[320:16.61]My mochi, weak from exhaustion, lunged at the monster and they both fell into the sea.
[320:22.10]My mochi protected me despite my selfishness.
[320:25.74]I can't raise a mochi again.
[320:28.90]Sorry, I want to be alone for a while.
[320:34.61]I never saw him raising a mochi at school.
[320:37.49]Even though they are so popular because they are so easy to raise.
[320:41.71]Rio, I can't always be with Thane to help him.
[320:45.01]Please support him as much as you can.
[320:48.88]Bye then.
[320:52.00]Me, me support Thane.
[320:59.96]Okay.
[321:04.02]So that's, uh, I got more backstory now, apparently.
[321:13.68]Let me see the stats.
[321:16.61]376 intellect.
[321:17.67]He's E rank.
[321:19.87]I don't want to... I really don't want to do this.
[321:22.41]I don't want to gap him.
[321:23.27]You want to see what's going to happen with this?
[321:28.47]Everyone's going to forfeit every single match.
[321:30.79]It's going to be a waste of menu pressing.
[321:37.17]Well, there's a fight tonight.
[321:39.15]This is the big one for Roberto.
[321:44.50]Do I even have to show up?
[321:45.42]Can I just send like a piece of paper?
[321:49.62]That says Hizbu's gonna come today.
[321:56.53]No!
[321:56.95]My god, man!
[321:58.33]I don't want- I'm trying to press down and hit no.
[322:12.46]Whatever.
[322:33.19]Here.
[322:36.87]Have a carrot.
[322:43.16]Why is Digimon still around but Monster Rancher isn't?
[322:49.12]I think it has something to do with the fact that the gimmick of this game...
[322:53.73]really could only live a certain amount of time the whole cd thing what would you do now it'd be kind of hard to do now you could still do discs but I think somebody mentioned I don't know where I read it but like maybe like urls or something for this would be like interesting maybe qr codes yeah
[323:23.65]Barcodes, yeah, that'd be cool.
[323:25.95]But you'd also need a way to scan them.
[323:28.27]And you're talking about another game peripheral.
[323:30.63]That's probably why there was a Monster Rancher announcement, right?
[323:33.66]On their Twitter.
[323:36.08]This game really can only exist on mobile, if that's the case.
[323:42.34]QR scan with your phone, right?
[323:49.45]Alright, Roberto, let's go.
[323:56.98]But yeah, there was a recent announcement from the Monster Rancher Twitter that was like, hey, here we come, soon.
[324:05.61]Yo, all you monster battling freaks, this is the day you've been waiting for.
[324:09.93]Win and you get a ticket to glory.
[324:11.51]You'll be rank A. Lose and you get nothing.
[324:15.27]Who will a goddess look fondly upon?
[324:17.64]Only one of you.
[324:19.76]Now show us a good fight.
[324:20.90]Official grade, rank B, in trouble.
[324:25.56]Roberto versus Depart.
[324:31.48]320 intelligence, 240 defense.
[324:32.98]Pretty across the board.
[324:34.04]I have almost 500 power.
[324:36.86]Let's wipe the floor with him.
[324:41.22]To get to rank A. Del, out of the cannon.
[325:05.82]So this is a skull.
[325:08.40]Skull doll thing.
[325:09.56]Let's see if I can get it quickly here.
[325:15.94]Good start.
[325:16.84]Oh, wow.
[325:17.54]You're nothing.
[325:19.23]This is rank B, man.
[325:20.25]You can't be fucking around now.
[325:23.93]Yeah.
[325:26.27]Back to the miners.
[325:35.77]I'm keeping you from writing your lab report.
[325:37.43]I'm sorry.
[325:39.55]Go get that done.
[325:42.21]There's a VOD.
[325:42.87]You can watch the VOD if you want.
[325:43.95]If you're into it.
[325:50.00]Alright.
[325:50.60]DeRoss versus Roberto.
[325:57.22]Oh, high speed.
[326:00.53]Shouldn't be that concerned about it.
[326:05.61]This is B rank, man.
[326:09.01]You don't quit to get to A rank.
[326:13.75]That's unbelievable.
[326:15.21]Alright, Kalorn.
[326:16.48]327 health.
[326:17.42]Just high HP.
[326:34.74]It's weird.
[326:35.26]I mean, hot dog things.
[326:37.92]Let's get in here and just try to get it.
[326:39.24]Let's just try to get it right now.
[326:42.18]That was risky, but it was worth it.
[326:43.32]Oh, do it again!
[326:48.05]See you later.
[326:50.45]That was square.
[326:52.43]Power move.
[326:53.93]That was risky.
[327:04.78]Balboa is 3-0.
[327:07.84]Looks like that's the competition.
[327:15.91]Raticon.
[327:20.84]Pretty balanced across the board.
[327:22.08]Nothing too scary, I don't think.
[327:34.26]It's one of these robots.
[327:35.12]Alright, let's see how we're going to do this here.
[327:41.51]Got it.
[327:44.23]Follow it up with just a swing.
[327:46.81]Check this.
[327:47.21]Ready?
[327:47.79]Power swing.
[327:50.64]Again.
[327:52.24]Don't counter that.
[327:53.16]Uh-oh.
[327:54.14]It's alright.
[327:56.42]Back it up.
[328:00.90]It's two counters, is it?
[328:02.58]God, that sucks to just guess.
[328:03.95]Alright.
[328:14.29]If I beat Balboa, I... It's done.
[328:19.36]Even if I lose to Balboa... No, he's 5-0.
[328:21.02]No, this is bad.
[328:23.74]We're both 4-0.
[328:27.12]Really, it has to come down to this.
[328:32.66]Alright.
[328:36.66]322 defense, 350 power, and a ton of health.
[328:40.84]Slow speed.
[328:41.60]I have a lot more power, but I don't have that much defense.
[328:46.30]Let's go for it.
[328:57.04]Well, well, so you've really come to fight in the competition.
[329:00.35]Oh, don't worry.
[329:00.89]I'm not interested in getting revenge for that time you punched me.
[329:04.27]I didn't punch you.
[329:05.03]My friend did.
[329:06.87]Watch yourself, my Bob-o's sword.
[329:08.69]Fighting skills are tip-top and sharp as a knife.
[329:13.24]Who knows?
[329:13.56]He might even accidentally injure your poor monster.
[329:15.92]Bob-o-hoo!
[329:19.90]I have the same thing, don't I?
[329:28.02]Except you we have like this you guys is it made out of cakes You this is like the Candyland version of my character Don't do that Got it, that's a big one.
[329:53.27]Oh
[329:58.77]You got nothing.
[330:04.67]What was that Balboa mixed with?
[330:06.37]It was almost like one of the slugs?
[330:09.16]Like one of the little cake people?
[330:17.94]The goddess showed her love to Roberto.
[330:19.66]There's a fairy and a robot.
[330:22.46]Oh, okay.
[330:24.63]Congratulations.
[330:37.98]Nah, what's going on?
[330:40.58]Hope you come to your senses, Deal, and can see that your methods were wrong.
[330:45.98]Ah, you cheated.
[330:47.48]You met with Wit, didn't you?
[330:49.26]What did Wit do for you?
[330:51.56]Like, like steroids.
[330:53.28]Yeah, you use steroids to strengthen your monsters.
[330:57.26]How awful, how could you dare say such a thing?
[331:00.96]Shut up!
[331:02.00]I can't accept this, I won't!
[331:02.98]What do you mean I did?
[331:07.17]I never did steroids.
[331:13.17]One of the other ones is on steroids, not this one.
[331:17.09]How can we save the poor monsters on your ranch?
[331:20.15]Darn it, what will it take to convince Steele?
[331:23.40]You're right, Ryo!
[331:44.96]Maybe we should go to the town of Visley and Elvis.
[331:49.47]I can't do that.
[331:50.39]That's not gonna happen.
[331:51.27]That was really, like... That was phoned in, like, crazy.
[331:54.17]Don't ever try to do a Goofy.
[332:00.36]Because only one guy can do Goofy.
[332:09.36]Roberto's too famous.
[332:20.04]What a hack performance.
[332:24.92]It was.
[332:25.28]I kind of figured... I figured halfway through that that wasn't turning out the way that I thought.
[332:31.38]And I just kept going.
[332:32.44]Talt, hello!
[332:34.24]Oh, Talt.
[332:35.38]Hi.
[332:36.90]How are your monsters doing?
[332:38.12]Shall I give Fane's monsters a checkup?
[332:41.31]Well, thank you.
[332:41.85]That would be great.
[332:43.71]Let's see.
[332:44.89]How's everybody doing?
[332:47.21]All done.
[332:47.63]None of them had any problems at all.
[332:50.73]What's with these mochis?
[332:52.39]Everybody has a mochi, apparently, that tragically died.
[332:56.45]I guess that's how it started.
[333:16.86]But isn't it hard for you?
[333:18.56]It's your job to protect life, but you have that sad memory.
[333:22.76]I had a similar experience.
[333:25.10]Really?
[333:25.36]What happened to you?
[333:26.18]Did you write that down?
[333:30.54]That is a sad story.
[333:32.62]But I think of that experience as inspiration.
[333:35.08]I always think I've got to try hard for Mochina.
[333:38.82]I figure if I don't keep working with monsters that Mochina would keep- would weep in heaven.
[333:44.54]She'd probably think it was her fault.
[333:49.44]I bet your mochi was happy because it cared about you enough to risk its life to protect you.
[333:55.68]Thanks, Talt.
[334:00.34]Not at all.
[334:00.82]I'll come to do a checkup again.
[334:01.96]Bye.
[334:02.26]Okay.
[334:09.95]We now have... 585 power.
[334:19.00]That is such an unbelievable number.
[334:22.00]I want it to be 600.
[334:22.88]And then we're going to stack health.
[334:30.04]A rank.
[334:30.82]Roberto can still... He's still living.
[334:35.67]Let's do it.
[334:36.75]Let's see what it looks like.
[334:37.97]This is like the real league.
[334:42.53]This is the actual league.
[334:55.01]So what about the other ones?
[334:55.81]We've got... 5... 206, 275 health.
[335:01.65]You can slow down on the health now.
[335:03.21]He's got plenty.
[335:06.23]Maybe, uh... Intellect and Accuracy for a little bit.
[335:11.34]You, on the other hand.
[335:12.26]Let's get you to 400 Intellect.
[335:14.00]No!
[335:14.46]You have to do a tournament!
[335:16.71]Everyone's just gonna quit.
[335:18.21]We just have to do menu spam for like 10 minutes.
[335:20.27]Look at this shit.
[335:24.29]Tournament here.
[335:25.17]Here.
[335:25.63]Oh, here.
[335:25.87]Alright.
[335:49.26]Book.
[335:50.97]I have a tournament now, but I can do the book again.
[335:53.57]No, don't even, just let somebody else do it.
[335:55.33]You just rest.
[335:59.61]You do the light blade again.
[336:02.19]Sandbag, yeah.
[336:03.73]And then rest.
[336:05.45]You can rest and you can tub.
[336:20.48]Roberto.
[336:21.28]Almost at 600.
[336:22.82]How much more do we need?
[336:29.42]At 602, you made it.
[336:31.64]Now just work on a little bit of life.
[336:33.02]A little bit of extra accuracy.
[336:35.16]Okay, how's everybody doing?
[336:38.86]Food.
[336:40.06]You can eat.
[336:43.21]Have a beef.
[336:47.81]Roberto can easily get S rank.
[336:49.27]I would suggest now icing two monsters and making some new ones.
[336:53.42]Some of the A rank fusions can be really good.
[336:57.24]Okay.
[337:00.28]So who are we icing here?
[337:03.95]I'm going to say... Hmm.
[337:06.79]I don't know what to do about this.
[337:15.86]Unprover is just... I feel like he's gonna be insane.
[337:24.93]Maybe these two?
[337:26.03]Blossom and, um, Adrock?
[337:32.56]I'm gonna try to do Adrock and Blossom.
[337:37.92]I forgot Adrock was a monster, to be honest.
[337:52.68]Are they friends?
[337:55.70]Make sure that they're friends.
[338:00.70]Blossom and Ad-Rock are not really that close.
[338:13.13]We can just do it.
[338:14.33]Who cares?
[338:15.57]We're almost... We're at S rank anyways, pretty much.
[338:17.45]We just gotta beat A rank with you.
[338:18.69]You'll do it easily.
[338:25.00]Roberto's friends with everybody, but Roberto's still good.
[338:29.36]And I really don't want to have to go through every single tournament again.
[338:38.71]You can stick around.
[338:42.81]Let's do it.
[338:43.27]Let's head to the shrine.
[338:50.64]Spyroid and Roberto are the only friendships that matter.
[338:53.40]Okay.
[338:57.40]It's Head of the Shrine.
[338:58.74]Oh, there's a competition today.
[339:01.40]Who?
[339:03.36]Oh, right.
[339:04.16]I'm Prover.
[339:07.01]Visley?
[339:07.67]Uh, no.
[339:13.37]Fuck that.
[339:14.71]Let's just go back and association and ice people.
[339:27.50]Let's see what we get.
[339:35.13]It's time to retire.
[339:36.65]Add rock.
[339:43.88]Goodbye.
[339:49.26]What?
[339:51.16]Retire one of them?
[339:51.82]What do you mean?
[339:52.22]Frozen...
[339:57.83]Oh.
[339:59.71]Prover.
[340:02.52]Vroomer.
[340:03.56]Energize.
[340:04.36]Shroomer.
[340:04.98]Get rid of Shroomer.
[340:21.59]Wait, what?
[340:23.67]Fuse them, don't retire them.
[340:26.53]Don't they have to be frozen to... They have to be retired to freeze them.
[340:32.30]Freeze instead of retiring.
[340:34.62]How do you freeze?
[340:36.12]Don't you have to be retired?
[340:37.36]What are we talking about?
[340:38.88]Wait, what?
[340:44.21]Don't you... Don't you have to freeze them?
[340:47.93]You have to retire them to freeze them.
[340:56.19]You can fuse the retired ones to open up space.
[340:58.51]Yeah, but those ones don't do anything.
[341:05.29]We already tried this before.
[341:06.21]We already did this.
[341:08.28]And these combinations don't do anything.
[341:10.14]They're terrible.
[341:10.98]Retiring is deleting.
[341:11.86]Yeah, I know.
[341:16.42]Yeah, I don't... I'm gonna delete Shroomer.
[341:19.34]He was one of the eight Willy Wonka mushrooms that we had.
[341:24.72]I know.
[341:25.28]I know that.
[341:31.91]If I combine, like, Prover and, like, Energize, I'm just going to get another dumb, useless Energize bunny.
[341:40.62]Okay, like, Prover and Energize.
[341:43.50]Are you ready?
[341:45.32]It's going to show me.
[341:46.78]Let's see what it does.
[341:49.24]Don't use a combination item.
[341:52.34]Yeah, like, Mush Tan and then Gun Bit.
[341:57.89]Look at these terrible stats.
[342:03.41]We've already seen Mushtan.
[342:08.50]It's a gun bit, let's go.
[342:11.18]Just energize.
[342:39.91]That's why I was just retiring them.
[342:43.99]Like, let's do Maus and Vroomer.
[342:53.28]No item.
[342:55.90]Yeah, we've already seen these.
[342:57.12]Skunk Roller, remember?
[342:59.14]Yeah, I'm just retiring them.
[343:11.02]So we're going to do Blossom and Add Rock, right?
[343:15.52]These two are going to be combined when he's eventually about to die.
[343:20.52]You also need to rank up, too.
[343:27.67]That's weird.
[343:28.81]There should be more fusions unlocked, but there's not more options.
[343:31.81]That's weird.
[343:32.17]Alright, Blossom.
[343:36.75]Goodbye.
[343:45.05]Yes.
[343:46.57]Retire... The next Maus... Maus was the monster I got for free in the beginning of the game.
[343:52.70]Goodbye.
[344:03.50]That's the start of Pokémon, yeah.
[344:09.11]Alright.
[344:10.73]Now we get some real combos here.
[344:13.53]So Blossom...
[344:15.93]And add rock.
[344:20.41]Uh, no item yet.
[344:21.45]Let me see what happens.
[344:24.39]Mom Mew.
[344:26.25]Rage Rock.
[344:27.55]And Ant Mew.
[344:36.53]Rage Rock.
[344:38.39]Those stats are awful.
[344:57.64]artificial sprite and artificial they were both e yeah yeah I mean this is a rock monster we don't have one of these
[345:18.51]You'd think a rock monster would have way more base defense.
[345:24.15]Oh, now that's the secondary.
[345:25.59]Okay.
[345:30.39]Rage rock just is add rock.
[345:35.83]Aunt Mew.
[345:38.13]Let's do it.
[345:39.49]Those stats aren't even that good.
[345:45.62]Let's go.
[345:45.98]Fuck it.
[345:46.22]Let's see it.
[345:55.87]What the hell?
[346:09.36]Kill it!
[346:47.88]Okay, that's that's blueberry Alright Um, I'm gonna go see if I can get a new disk in here Let's go back to town Let's go to the shrine.
[347:10.39]Let's put a cd in see if I can get anything From saucer
[347:17.56]Uh, what do I have for a disk that's still just hanging out here?
[347:19.72]Let me see.
[347:20.22]I gotta grab one.
[347:23.22]Now I'm gonna freeze Blueberry.
[347:24.90]I will.
[347:26.13]Don't worry.
[347:29.01]How about... Um... What do you guys think about... The Sopranos?
[347:43.08]Think that works?
[347:46.61]Ed, Edd n Eddy.
[347:47.17]Alright, we got Ed, Edd n Eddy, The Sopranos, and PsyOps, The Mindgate Conspiracy.
[347:56.22]Let's do Ed, Edd n Eddy first.
[348:12.66]Put it in upside down.
[348:13.74]You trying to get me to break my PlayStation 2?
[348:24.89]Put in a disk containing a single JPG of Beanbag Sonic.
[348:30.44]Alright.
[348:32.46]Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[348:57.13]Something we've not seen yet.
[349:01.56]Thanks for waiting.
[349:02.46]Create the monster.
[349:20.80]That's a weirdo.
[349:21.36]It is the three Eds.
[349:26.68]There's Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[349:32.26]It's the first time we've seen it.
[349:33.36]Alright, let me add a page.
[349:35.40]Take it home.
[349:35.98]Should I take away Ed, Edd, and Eddy?
[349:44.13]It even has the right colors.
[350:00.87]I can't fit it all.
[350:02.67]Yeah, the three Eds, like three Ed.
[350:07.64]Three E-D.
[350:11.72]Or three, three D. Freed.
[350:15.56]Threed.
[350:16.08]Or it could be Ed Boys.
[350:20.80]Alright, fine, Ed Boys.
[350:31.82]No, I need to go forward.
[350:34.55]I can't go forward.
[350:47.05]Ed boys.
[350:52.72]Is it two?
[350:55.26]Well, I mean, it's Ed with two Ds, Eddie with two Ds, and Ed with one D. Should it be two Ds?
[351:07.29]No, I'm not gonna make it B-O-I-S.
[351:10.98]This is the Ed Boys.
[351:15.14]2D or 3D?
[351:17.74]Two B's in boys?
[351:18.96]No, no, no, no, no.
[351:21.27]It's just Ed Boys.
[351:29.59]Can I do any more?
[351:31.38]Alright, let's freeze, uh, blueberry.
[351:46.38]Old English.
[351:50.18]Let me get a sip of my water.
[351:53.36]Let me get a sip of my water.
[351:57.07]Let's see the stats of the Ed Boids.
[351:59.93]This is terrible.
[352:00.37]115, 127, 125.
[352:00.77]Just garbage.
[352:01.19]What about you?
[352:19.75]Um, well definitely gonna freeze blueberry no, not the shrine association No, no back back back back back back Put in the sopranos
[352:54.91]Put in blueberry.
[352:56.41]Freeze blueberry.
[353:04.84]Here's the thing, though.
[353:05.56]I do have a lot of the second and third level training devices.
[353:09.94]So, there is that.
[353:18.73]So, it's going to take a lot less time to get that much stat points.
[353:30.59]Let's put in the Sprouts.
[353:43.77]I do want new types, though.
[353:47.83]I see some people saying, hey, well, those ones, when you froze that one, the blueberry was good.
[353:51.98]Yeah, but it was still just one of those little toy sack puppet things.
[353:57.94]I want something new.
[354:02.54]Alright, Sopranos is going to go in.
[354:28.72]Done?
[354:29.28]That was quick.
[354:38.19]Soprano Something we have not seen before
[355:16.07]No.
[355:20.33]No, I don't want to duck.
[355:21.45]Psyops.
[355:52.23]PsyOps the Mind Gate Conspiracy.
[355:57.87]Use Monster Rancher 3.
[355:58.79]I actually don't even know where that disk is.
[356:02.56]I'm not sure I brought that with me to Vegas.
[356:17.35]No, I didn't like it.
[356:22.26]I didn't like that game.
[356:31.71]Monster Rancher.
[356:34.33]Come back in.
[356:36.89]It was BBS?
[356:37.95]The Boston era?
[356:38.89]Yeah.
[356:40.31]That is back when I was in Massachusetts.
[356:42.19]You're right.
[356:50.07]I've unlocked like eight to twelve new species.
[356:55.53]Can we get something else besides the sack people, the ducks, and the plants, and the shrooms?
[357:03.68]What's the process here?
[357:04.66]Alright, so this game, any CD that has data on it has a seed.
[357:13.11]What I'm doing is pulling the seed
[357:17.94]from the disk and then swapping the CDs because you have to act- and I think the game may have locked up here.
[357:25.98]Does it have to be PS2?
[357:26.94]It does not.
[357:32.63]Uh... The PS2 is making a lot of noise.
[357:44.61]It's trying to read- did I like burn out my reader?
[357:52.42]Uh-oh.
[357:53.02]Hold on.
[358:08.09]Come on.
[358:12.37]Come on.
[358:13.91]What is this?
[358:17.59]It's getting stuck.
[358:18.85]It's repeating itself.
[358:26.19]The PS2 got fucking whacked.
[358:28.69]I'm going to try something drastic here.
[358:37.66]I just opened it and closed it.
[358:54.95]Come on.
[359:02.18]Hold on.
[359:36.86]What is this, an NES cartridge?
[359:40.18]This better be good.
[359:40.92]It's a plant.
[359:44.52]It's a windmill robot plant.
[359:59.79]It's steampunk.
[360:17.76]Hold on, I gotta get another disk.
[360:20.04]No, I don't want another plant, guys.
[360:23.09]I've had like three of them.
[360:25.39]Hold on.
[360:27.55]How about... Uh... What's this one?
[360:38.14]We got...
[360:43.81]I don't even want to put that in the tray.
[360:46.11]That's the stupid without warning game.
[360:51.83]Freedom Fighters.
[361:03.06]Clock Tower, of course.
[361:05.52]Clock Tower 3.
[361:10.85]I did see him in a couple days ago.
[361:14.86]Let's get Clocktower in here.
[361:20.80]And whatever we get from one of these, that's it.
[361:28.52]We got Freedom Fighters as well.
[361:31.82]Space Channel 5.
[361:32.52]Dreamcast does not work for some reason.
[361:34.48]It's something about the discs.
[361:37.66]And the data and how they're coded on the CD or something.
[361:40.88]Because we kept getting the same monster over and over again.
[361:53.32]Okay, let's go It's another plant I'm just gonna win the game with S rank and just feed Roberto like energy fuel every day and make sure I can get to S rank and win No softlock this time, that's good
[362:33.67]I want cats.
[362:44.61]Raid of Fighters.
[362:53.63]This is it.
[363:02.14]I am making a commitment to this creature.
[363:11.90]Putting the disk for The Office Season 2.
[363:18.58]I didn't bring very many DVDs or anything with me here.
[363:20.94]Alright, pray for something cool.
[363:25.18]Because this is pretty much our last shot.
[363:31.16]Alright, close it up.
[363:41.81]AKA The Good Season.
[363:44.03]Don't people love that show?
[363:46.81]Except for like the last two seasons or something.
[363:52.07]Go buy a bunch of $1 DVDs.
[363:53.87]I did do that for Monster Ranch 2.
[364:01.83]Well, there it is Mr jello What's Thanos It looks like snow somebody looks like snow white
[364:50.58]Squisher.
[364:53.04]Rubber Cement Man.
[365:23.71]Slop.
[365:24.79]That's it.
[365:26.07]This monster doesn't matter.
[365:27.21]Let's take a look at stats.
[365:31.97]How sad that monster looks.
[365:33.57]Okay, here we go.
[365:34.99]Slop.
[365:37.39]I liked Wuss Thanos.
[365:40.51]But that's too, like, meme-y.
[365:41.90]I get it.
[365:43.56]Not bad base stats.
[365:45.74]That's... We put this guy on the magic book.

[366:49.77]I want to see how... On day one, what your stats are like.
[366:55.57]Wait, what does it say?
[367:02.36]Oh, somebody doesn't, who doesn't have a schedule?
[367:07.92]Oh, you, okay.
[367:13.23]Plus six on the magic book, come on.
[367:22.13]You can do better than that.
[367:28.03]You don't need anything?
[367:28.71]He puts on glasses.
[367:38.58]That's so stupid.
[367:53.16]Young monsters gain less from the machines.
[367:55.22]Yeah, I probably should just have them not do any machines, right?
[367:59.60]Alright.
[368:04.08]Rank A. Seven grand.
[368:05.74]Salmon.
[368:07.08]Let's see what the competition is like in the second highest rank in the game.
[368:14.87]The Galaxy Cook.
[368:27.15]Roberto and Slim.
[368:33.74]Not that scary.
[368:38.20]Everybody's going to die in one hit anyways.
[368:39.46]I mean, you're cool looking.
[369:02.25]This power is out of control.
[369:05.43]That's just what happens.
[369:07.87]When you stack it.
[369:08.61]These have 600 fucking power.
[369:16.79]Just keep them alive to the end of the game.
[369:18.37]300, almost 400 health.
[369:31.58]That's nothing.
[369:32.28]I'll tear through you.
[369:42.33]Bomber?
[369:46.17]Okay, that's fine.
[369:55.64]We didn't stand a chance.
[369:59.52]Kill everyone.
[370:06.20]What's the championship?
[370:11.02]Wilhelm.
[370:11.66]It's another one of, uh, it's a sword user.
[370:17.83]350 power.
[370:18.25]You can't match my strength, I'm sorry.
[370:28.61]Oh fuck, it's the same.
[370:31.89]You're just me from another dimension.
[370:34.57]There can only be one of us, I'm sorry.
[370:40.88]Sit down.
[370:53.59]Congratulations!
[370:56.29]Seven thousand dollars.
[370:57.41]I mean, this is just raising... This is raising somebody.
[371:09.55]The right way.
[371:11.98]Complete min-maxing steps.
[371:24.46]Can't wait till he dies.
[371:26.68]Well, hey.
[371:31.68]Easy.
[371:32.04]Okay.
[371:48.12]So, let me ask a question.
[371:50.58]If I fuse Roberto with somebody that's E rank, is it just going to come out as like a shitty E rank monster?
[372:11.85]Do not.
[372:12.19]Do not.
[372:16.01]Just saves come and find out.
[372:18.41]They always come out as E. Because, I mean, it just seems so counterproductive to just get three people at the same time to rank A. I want to see what happens.
[372:34.01]I'm curious.
[372:43.76]We gotta save.
[372:54.88]I'm just curious what happens.
[373:06.64]It's either they come out at the current rank or two ranks lower.
[373:09.24]Let's see.
[373:16.01]Combine... Combine Roberto...
[373:25.20]With... Um, I don't know, like, Broomer?
[373:30.39]Prover?
[373:31.37]I'm just curious, let's see.
[373:36.65]Who's D?
[373:37.79]Somebody that's E. Let's see, somebody that's E. No combo item.
[373:43.29]What comes out?
[373:45.69]E. Two Es, and they're both just awful base stats.
[373:51.12]So that's not gonna happen.
[373:53.26]Not even any stat increases at all.
[374:03.99]So what if it's D?
[374:04.83]Let's see.
[374:12.32]So Roberto.
[374:14.54]And Vroomer's D. Do I get a D monster?
[374:22.38]No.
[374:22.82]These definitely look like they have better stats, though.
[374:38.74]Okay, here's the thing I don't understand about this game.
[374:42.37]If it gives you a rank E monster with stats that are that good based, okay, if you have two people that are high rank, right?
[374:51.04]Won't I just one-hit kill every single monster in rank E?
[374:55.84]What's the point of even doing E tournaments?
[375:05.53]You just climb faster, but, I mean, it seems kind of redundant to do all the tournaments again at the bottom when all the monsters are going to have, like, 100 stats.
[375:25.43]It's just a smurf account.
[375:26.53]That's really what it is.
[375:30.16]Um, okay, well...
[375:33.62]I'm gonna bring the dra- I'm gonna bring the dragon over here just to see what happens.
[375:39.80]We have it saved, so don't worry.
[375:46.95]Uh, can I retire from here?
[375:48.47]Oh fuck, whoops.
[376:03.09]Might be able to beat the game with Roberto.
[376:04.61]Yeah, that's true.
[376:05.55]I mean, I could, but I'm just curious what I could get.
[376:11.56]Yeah, let's retire Spyroid and just see what happens.
[376:17.47]I want to see what it would be.
[376:32.90]Uh, yeah, retire somebody, just... I'm doing this for the sake of just checking.
[376:37.02]Uh, get rid of, like, Pruver.
[376:38.08]Who cares?
[376:49.40]Okay, they're friends.
[376:54.79]Roberto and... Spyroid are friends.
[377:00.83]So this should be more favorable.
[377:06.71]No combo item just yet.
[377:09.96]Glacier.
[377:11.52]Zag.
[377:13.66]I mean, that's... 191 power base is pretty great, but... 175.
[377:21.55]Vesuvius?
[377:25.67]Vesuvius?
[377:42.07]Fire, Flutter, Detail, D-Bite, and this is Swing, Charge, Kick, and Cut in two.
[377:49.46]Is this a... dragon with a sword?
[377:51.98]Let's see.
[377:58.96]Or is this a... just a dragon-coated knight?
[378:03.59]Alright, that's pretty cool.
[378:14.02]So that's a Dragon Knight.
[378:16.94]He's really cool.
[378:18.02]But... I have to start over again.
[378:20.04]I mean, can I?
[378:23.71]Let... Just wait.
[378:25.59]Just wait, wait, wait.
[378:26.21]No, no, no.
[378:27.41]I'm gonna get... Let's wait till... Let's wait till Roberto's gonna die.
[378:31.81]I'm gonna bring Spyroid up to, like, rank C. Or B. Let's see what the other one looks like.
[378:44.61]I'm going to try to get to... Let's just wait till he's dead.
[378:48.05]I'm going to keep leveling them both, and then we're going to pick whichever one is the best here.
[378:54.05]No combo item.
[378:54.81]I can do a combo item too.
[378:55.83]Okay, let's see what this one is.
[379:02.07]Freeze Roberto now so he doesn't die?
[379:03.75]Well, the theory is that I'm going to be saving so frequently.
[379:06.51]It's just the same thing.
[379:08.07]No, the other thing's way cooler.
[379:10.02]By far.
[379:13.60]This is just a better base version of the one that I already have.
[379:17.68]Alright, let's load it.
[379:19.88]That second... The Dragon Knight was awesome.
[379:21.62]That's what we're going to do.
[379:27.63]Let's see... What combo items can I do?
[379:30.71]Combo item.
[379:40.42]Speed Stone, Defense Stone, Int Stone.
[379:43.72]Alright, that's kind of cool.
[379:45.96]Hired Defense.
[379:53.77]Look at that defense.
[379:56.69]I'll never have to level that up once.
[380:00.13]this is Glacier stats aren't nearly as good as this one though this is like really really good to start off with especially if they if I get him to rank S and Spyroid to rank like C or B Glacier is the same yeah it's the same one yeah that's the plan we're gonna do Defense Stone and get these both to rank like C and S let's load the game
[380:40.48]You could also swap the order.
[380:41.40]Oh yeah, you could swap the order too.
[380:43.70]Let me see that.
[380:45.32]Just in case, you know, just in case.
[380:46.54]Let's get our bases covered.
[380:59.06]Hello, Fane.
[381:04.83]Spyroid.
[381:08.25]And then Roberto.
[381:11.63]Use an item.
[381:13.15]Just to see what it looks like.
[381:16.73]And we can get... Same stuff.
[381:22.54]Same deal.
[381:24.26]Alright.
[381:35.13]I'm just going to turn the PlayStation off.
[381:37.93]Can I load game from here?
[381:39.41]Probably not.
[381:42.44]Alright, I'll see you in a second.
[382:01.39]Data corrupted.
[382:03.43]That would be awful, but we're good.
[382:07.51]So for the remainder of the stream, we're going to try to get Roberto as high as we can before he dies.
[382:17.96]And then when he's dead, just right before he dies, freeze him.
[382:24.24]Make sure he's friends enough with Spyroid.
[382:26.94]Get Spyroid to like rank C or B or whatever and just see how far I can get that and then fuse them together.
[382:50.89]So, the question I have to people that have played this game before, if I get to S rank, and he's still alive, I pretty much have beaten the game.
[383:01.03]I just have to- do you win- is there a credit sequence?
[383:05.14]Should I not do that?
[383:06.16]Should I just fuse and just have our last child be the Dragon Knight and just- that's cool?
[383:14.00]It is getting late too, isn't it?
[383:17.44]Yes, okay.
[383:19.62]There is a final dungeon and final boss.
[383:22.60]I feel like I'm going to need three people to be high for that, though.
[383:31.75]So we got Spire.
[383:32.65]Alright, let's just keep going.
[383:33.55]What does the calendar look like?
[383:34.53]Roberto.
[383:37.09]Let's... Yeah, let's do this.
[383:39.44]Try to get to S rank as fast as possible.
[383:45.20]So that's good.
[383:45.82]And then...
[383:49.61]Any official turn?
[383:50.49]Do I have to do something here to get another official tournament?
[383:57.22]Oh, you don't?
[383:57.72]And I didn't as a kid.
[383:59.16]There is a credit sequence.
[384:03.74]Okay.
[384:14.77]The map generation could be really annoying.
[384:16.29]I don't know.
[384:18.68]Well, I'm not going to stop yet, but we'll see how far we are in the next like 45 minutes or so.
[384:29.61]And if I'm not like close, because let's put it this way.
[384:35.75]I'm going to be, I have Mr. Mosquito.
[384:39.36]So Mr. Mosquito is a game that I'm going to be playing.
[384:42.32]And I also have, um, what's Shadow of Rome?
[384:47.18]Let me see what we got here.
[384:52.39]Yeah, I have Shadow of Rome and Mr. Mosquito.
[384:55.59]So maybe what we'd end up doing is just if I don't... If I'm like another hour or two out... I would probably just cap the stream next week.
[385:06.03]After all the other stuff I want to do.
[385:08.95]Start with Mr. Mosquito, play through that, do like Shadow of Rome or... And finish this.
[385:20.06]At some point during that stream.
[385:23.98]Or start with it and then move on to Mr. Mosquito and then do Shadow of Rome.
[385:29.83]Because if I'm this close to the end, then the next time I turn the PlayStation 2 on, I probably should finish it.
[385:37.79]So, but for now, let's just keep doing this for a little bit longer.
[385:43.22]Because tomorrow, I think me and Etalyx are going to try Risk of Rain 2 co-op.
[385:48.58]Seems like it's really fun.
[385:50.16]And then Saturday is the Sekiro scratch-off Jerma slots day.
[385:55.81]So that's kind of the plan for the next few days.
[385:59.35]But, calendar.
[386:01.87]Let's see if I can win some more of these.
[386:05.21]And then get to S tonight, I wonder.
[386:07.03]Let's try.
[386:11.82]Uh... Sandbag tonight.
[386:13.14]No, you know what?
[386:14.04]You're so powerful already.
[386:16.34]I probably should do something else, like... life.
[386:21.80]And then rest.
[386:25.13]You are the only two that really, really actually matter.
[386:34.17]Did I decide on the charity yet?
[386:36.52]No, I'm trying to... I've narrowed it down.
[386:42.10]I will tell you what the charity is, because I'm trying to get it to, like, a good charity, you know?
[386:47.16]Trying to do my research.
[386:55.89]So you are fine.
[386:57.69]You can actually switch these.
[387:00.63]Do this one.
[387:01.93]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[387:04.55]Get on the rodeo, why not?
[387:05.69]And then rest.
[387:06.37]Alright, let's go.
[387:15.32]Pretty good gain.
[387:25.81]Have some more meat.
[387:39.10]He's pretty tired.
[387:39.90]That's alright.
[387:41.22]You're fine.
[387:42.36]I can feed you.
[387:57.80]There we go.
[388:01.02]Uh... Is he sitting in a tub of himself?
[388:09.52]He just pissed in his tub.
[388:10.48]He just made a tub around himself and peed in it.
[388:14.23]Weirdo.
[388:20.13]Oh, it's just... It's tomorrow.
[388:28.89]There's a drink in there, too.
[388:30.89]That is, that's probably still... Also, piss.
[388:35.09]Alright, rest.
[388:36.13]Rest.
[388:37.93]You, uh, you big goofy fuck.
[388:40.34]I don't know what the hell you're gonna be doing.
[388:41.54]Um, life blade, maybe?
[388:43.32]I don't think any of these guys really matter.
[388:46.04]It's too much to have to deal with.
[388:49.26]Take too long.
[388:50.06]Everyone lives only a certain amount of time.
[388:53.42]I can't say I was a huge fan of the three-plus monsters to have on your ranch.
[389:10.53]Save it Target you don't it's just like you died.
[389:24.88]You're just not anything.
[389:25.86]I'm not gonna be using you anymore Alright, everyone do what you need to do
[389:39.56]Plus three.
[389:40.24]He just needs to rank up.
[389:41.88]But for him to rank up, I have to do three full tournaments, and then do the official tournament just to get him to rank D. I don't have time for that.
[389:50.66]I got like so many other things to have to deal with.
[390:00.46]Like, Roberto's almost dead, so I gotta get him as far up as I can before he dies.
[390:18.39]Okay, Paz.
[390:19.37]Let's see what you got.
[390:22.19]Not even close.
[390:30.92]Do a tag tournament?
[390:31.70]Yeah, I mean, okay, if you got this whole thing where you have five monsters that can be on the ranch at the same time, why on Earth would you have most of the tournaments be single tournaments?
[390:45.01]Isn't that kind of counterintuitive to how the very base of the game is supposed to be played?
[390:48.87]There it is.
[391:07.58]I mean, instead of it being the single tournaments, if half of the tournaments that you could select were T for team,
[391:14.71]It seems like this one tag tournament every like two or three months.
[391:18.91]They should be every other week.
[391:29.12]Because as it stands right now, it's almost like you have to focus on one or two and the other ones just kind of get left behind.
[391:34.38]Because there's not enough opportunity to rank them up when you have to do it five separate times.
[391:54.64]Buy the rights to Monster Rancher?
[391:56.10]Uh, I don't have that kind of money.
[392:01.82]Counter?
[392:02.73]Missed it, you're dead.
[392:15.61]Have you considered how many people in this game must fucking hate the two of you?
[392:20.90]Because we're unbeatable?
[392:32.08]Alright, well, hold on here.
[392:33.10]He's got 420 power and 400 defense.
[392:36.96]If anybody was going to stop me, it would be this kind of character right here.
[392:40.68]It's a dragon.
[392:55.39]Good dodge.
[392:55.87]Uh-oh.
[393:01.03]Uh-oh.
[393:06.53]You've got high defense, but I can... You scared me a little bit.
[393:20.85]Not very much, though.
[393:21.79]Just a tiny bit.
[393:27.82]Congratulations!
[393:30.08]So, for those of you that have played, what... How do I get the official cup to rank up to S?
[393:38.78]Is there something else I have to do?
[393:41.94]Is there a storyline thing that I have to progress to do it?
[393:45.30]Another town I have to go to?
[393:46.52]I don't know.
[394:00.65]Stop, stop, stop.
[394:03.73]Go to the new town.
[394:05.55]Well, let me just get...
[394:09.86]Uh, I wish, like, okay, so this is what I'm talking about.
[394:11.66]See, look, ready?
[394:14.10]Solo, solo, solo, solo, solo, solo, solo, solo, solo, solo, solo, TEAM!
[394:20.21]Why wouldn't, yeah, if you're gonna have a game with more than one, two, three, four, five monsters that need to be raised at the same time, why aren't half of these T?
[394:27.95]T, solo, T, T, T, why are they so far in between?
[394:32.08]Look at, like, rank E. May, ready?
[394:36.08]April.
[394:37.48]April, May, June, July, August, September.
[394:40.32]How many have you seen down here?
[394:41.72]One.
[394:41.98]In six months.
[394:43.32]Not enough T's.
[395:05.55]Wait, so you tell me... Okay, but this is a group battle.
[395:07.49]Like, so I can't pull anybody up here?
[395:11.21]Alright, well, it's all good.
[395:19.83]I'm close to the end anyways.
[395:27.33]Oh man, the devs really gotta release an update for this game.
[395:30.36]Well, there's the patch.
[395:41.16]Let's win one more.
[395:43.65]Which is down here.
[395:44.47]I just have to wait till... Let's see... Look at this shit, come on.
[395:51.63]Did you just forget to fill in the slots?
[395:55.64]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, like where are the tournaments?
[396:00.98]Can I just do this by myself?
[396:11.33]I can just pull you up here.
[396:13.07]Okay, like, you're gonna get destroyed.
[396:15.03]No, why can't I... Roberto has to kill... Okay, Roberto has to win.
[396:23.15]This is gonna be horrible.
[396:27.27]Does it have to be three?
[396:32.00]It's all five?!
[396:36.54]Is Roberto gonna have to kill all five people?
[396:39.78]Do you think he can do it?
[396:41.60]I don't think he can do it.
[396:43.22]Oh my god, this is going to be so stupid.
[396:44.92]He's not going to be able to do it.
[396:45.62]He's going to run out of guts.
[396:48.32]There's no way.
[396:48.82]He's going to run out of guts.
[396:49.52]It's not going to be possible.
[396:50.76]I wish I could just do it alone.
[396:55.95]I can't.
[396:56.75]No, that's not going to work either.
[397:06.47]Use the others as meat shields.
[397:09.95]Ugh.
[397:13.36]I'm just gonna have to... I'm just gonna spam the rest of this.
[397:15.52]We're just gonna rest.
[397:16.22]Everyone's gonna go to sleep for like a month.
[397:19.13]Let me go here.
[397:19.79]Fuck it, let's go.
[397:47.92]I also wish I could set up, like, an auto-feeder.
[398:03.72]How am I gonna hit A?
[398:05.00]Okay.
[398:05.52]Open menu.
[398:06.34]Open menu.
[398:08.06]Select item.
[398:13.69]I can't just, like, set this up?
[398:14.67]Like, you have a schedule system.
[398:24.05]Alright, let's go.
[398:24.61]Let me see that new town.
[398:28.54]Visley.
[398:29.12]Go to Visley.
[398:29.64]See if I can open up anything.
[398:30.46]I already scheduled a competition.
[398:32.56]Yeah, I need to open up the next story thing.
[398:39.95]Let's go to the school.
[398:41.33]We're going to find out why he got expelled.
[398:46.81]Nice to see you.
[398:47.41]What brings you here?
[398:49.11]Mrs. Casa, I want to talk to you about Dale.
[398:51.19]Dale?
[398:52.92]You see, it's very sad indeed.
[398:54.80]What?
[398:55.00]What happened?
[399:20.37]The ancient book, the Tomb of Black Arts, that sleeps in our school library and is rumored to contain ancient arts of monster strengthening.
[399:31.88]Our school forbids anybody from opening the pages of this dangerous book.
[399:36.74]He broke that rule.
[399:39.08]Arts of monster strengthening?
[399:40.76]Is that true?
[399:42.48]Why would you do that?
[399:44.68]Exactly, we were all surprised that one, the one who cared for the monsters most would do such a thing.
[399:51.29]That's why, when it happened, I asked you, are you covering for somebody?
[399:55.99]But you insisted it was your own doing.
[399:59.34]Yes, it was.
[400:01.10]Yes, of course, I see.
[400:02.92]I shall wait then.
[400:04.12]Wait for the day that you have grown strong enough to tell me the whole truth of this matter.
[400:11.58]Here we go.
[400:13.16]Out of the way!
[400:14.55]What's your problem?
[400:15.53]Get lost, I tell ya!
[400:18.57]Awww, Teacher Giuliano is... Hey, what's going on?
[400:24.51]Stop it, Lambda!
[400:26.35]Don't you have respect for your seniors?
[400:31.39]What the heck are you doing?
[400:33.07]I mean, uh... I'm so sorry, something has gotten into their heads.
[400:38.79]Huh, Chris, why?
[400:41.43]You there, what are you up to?
[400:42.51]Uh-oh, it's Mr. Richter.
[400:46.18]You bet it's Mr. Richter, you little punks.
[400:50.20]We're sorry.
[400:52.36]You two got what you deserved.
[400:54.54]Chris, I'm talking to you too.
[400:57.30]Yes, yes, Mr. Richter.
[400:59.76]Well, I'm sorry things are crazy around here.
[401:01.58]Here's your Class S license.
[401:04.00]Thanks for listening to our dumb, shitty story for the last 47 straight minutes.
[401:08.77]Get lost!
[401:13.78]Oh boy, finally they're out of my hair.
[401:16.56]To think that just a while back I was scolding you and your friends.
[401:23.12]Well, you seem to be doing well, Fane.
[401:25.13]You ought to be worried there for a while.
[401:28.79]Hope we can learn from all of this.
[401:30.55]In any case, I'm glad I had the chance to see you again.
[401:32.95]Hope we can learn from all this.
[401:35.89]In any case, I'm glad I had the chance to see you again.
[401:39.90]Hope we can learn from all of this.
[401:41.80]In any case, I'm glad I had the chance to see you again.
[401:44.20]Hope we can learn from all of this.
[401:48.06]In any case, I'm glad I had the chance to see you again.
[401:50.66]Hello.
[401:57.88]What brings you here?
[402:05.68]Oh, that's a...
[402:15.52]You want me to do it?
[402:16.54]Should I do it?
[402:17.20]You want me to do this?
[402:27.14]Should you want me to do it?
[402:47.99]Everything on... Alright, give me my stupid quest.
[402:59.62]What's the title of this stream?
[403:05.70]What is the title of this stream?
[403:08.66]The Five Horses of the Apocalypse.
[403:17.20]That was a last second title, wasn't it?
[403:18.98]Today's another nice day!
[403:20.36]Oh, we have a visitor!
[403:21.28]Hello, like always, delivery!
[403:26.17]Oh, Rank A Breeder's Certificate, awesome!
[403:28.05]Maybe it's from the battle with Deal?
[403:30.33]Although Deal didn't admit your victory.
[403:32.65]Rank A, that's amazing.
[403:33.83]I didn't know you were doing so well.
[403:35.57]Shit, I'm a big fan.
[403:36.78]So don't leave me out of the loop on your progress.
[403:40.02]I'm sorry.
[403:40.76]Thank you so much.
[403:42.34]Don't worry about it.
[403:42.96]Well, keep up the good work.
[403:45.70]Can I do it now?
[403:50.29]Fane, now you can enter the Visley competition.
[403:53.47]Yep.
[403:54.29]How are things?
[403:55.03]Anything today?
[403:55.77]Go ahead, take a look around.
[403:57.40]What will you do?
[403:59.22]Do you have anything that I can do?
[404:02.96]No.
[404:04.08]Anything I can appraise?
[404:06.22]No.
[404:07.44]No.
[404:08.38]Come on.
[404:09.32]S rank.
[404:11.50]Give me those tournaments.
[404:15.80]Team tournament.
[404:16.44]You can't do it.
[404:18.06]Alright, bingo.
[404:21.29]Done.
[404:22.30]And then that is going to be the Rank A competition.
[404:30.36]Get them prepared, get them ready.
[404:31.78]And then bingo, S Rank.
[404:36.25]Also, let me hold on a second here.
[404:39.89]Spyroid.
[404:45.11]And then this one.
[404:46.79]Spyroid will be ready.
[404:50.81]Let's go!
[405:02.54]I don't think you're going to beat the game until you win the S-rank tournament, which I don't think Roberto will live to.
[405:10.06]Well, I at least want to see the S-rank tournaments.
[405:13.97]Even if I don't do it and I'm going to end the stream.
[405:18.06]Like I said, I will probably clean it up on the next PlayStation 2 stream I do next week.
[405:24.70]So, this is not the end.
[405:26.88]We will do it again.
[405:28.74]We will clean it up.
[405:33.89]Roberto can definitely live too long to do it as long as you don't give him drugs and send him in a dungeon.
[405:41.09]Okay.
[405:41.73]Okay.
[405:46.81]Let's see.
[405:47.99]Let's go back here.
[405:51.12]Everyone has a thing to do, right?
[405:54.64]Sandbag.
[405:55.28]No, don't do sandbag.
[405:56.10]You already have so much power.
[405:58.18]I'd rather you do like life or something just to get some more.
[406:00.54]Or defense.
[406:05.47]The magic book.
[406:07.75]And you just stand on your tippy toes for a minute.
[406:19.01]Pretty good increase for a Spyroid.
[406:20.53]Alright.
[406:29.09]You're hungry.
[406:30.89]You love chocolate?
[406:31.55]You know what?
[406:31.85]I got one left for you.
[406:39.97]That's very odd.
[406:43.99]Okay.
[406:44.15]Okay.
[406:53.90]You're good on food.
[406:54.70]You are alright.
[406:58.10]You are hungry.
[406:59.28]What do you eat?
[406:59.96]Let's see.
[407:01.18]Canned fuel.
[407:02.00]Yeah, of course you love canned fuel.
[407:03.75]You're not gonna get it though.
[407:09.87]He turned himself into a basil lemonade.
[407:13.69]Where are you?
[407:16.31]How are you doing?
[407:16.90]Tired?
[407:31.46]Alright Spyroid just I'm gonna spam X think it'll work The hell is this
[407:57.61]Yeah, I was gonna hit X. She's speaking into a chalice.
[408:04.86]She's talking into a cup.
[408:07.48]Alright, Spyroid.
[408:11.59]Spam X the game.
[408:33.85]Final Guts!
[409:09.32]Oh my fucking god.
[409:19.97]Please stay the fuck down.
[409:27.21]God, it's hard when you don't have an overpowered character, huh?
[409:41.19]This game would piss me off to no end.
[409:43.41]Alright, shill.
[409:54.78]Burning.
[409:56.34]Pretty good start.
[409:57.60]And then we're gonna do... Counter it.
[410:04.78]What was it?
[410:05.82]Power?
[410:08.09]No.
[410:22.78]He's been paid to throw.
[410:23.90]Ladies and gentlemen, Spyroid wins!
[410:31.83]A lot of health, just realizing that now.
[410:52.25]Gambit.
[410:57.76]Flip him up.
[410:59.30]Let's go with a slowed now.
[411:01.42]That's good.
[411:03.84]Yeah.
[411:05.86]Counter.
[411:06.68]We missed it.
[411:07.50]That was eyes.
[411:22.24]A ton of health, no accuracy.
[411:24.88]Look, it doesn't matter.
[411:25.47]We just have to get him to a higher rank so he can be melded together.
[411:33.61]Gotcha!
[411:42.04]That's the eyes of somebody that didn't know there was a math test.
[411:59.80]That face went, pop quiz.
[412:10.97]That face went, my boy.
[412:12.01]Alright.
[412:21.19]We're close.
[412:21.95]We're so close.
[412:23.29]We're almost there.
[412:26.58]Not much longer.
[412:29.18]We just have to do this one here.
[412:30.76]Right, he's already signed up for it.
[412:34.05]And then you have to go this way.
[412:35.43]That official one after beating this one.
[412:39.27]Just relax, train, and we'll be fine.
[412:44.15]Rest.
[412:46.31]Don't rest.
[412:46.82]You don't like resting, so what you should do instead is get on the rodeo.
[412:53.42]Who cares what you two do?
[413:12.23]Here.
[413:13.55]Take some beef.
[413:15.89]Crunchy.
[413:19.81]Don't feed, don't feed him a bone.
[413:24.06]And, who else wants to eat food?
[413:27.86]You, what do you want, a tomato?
[413:29.22]Whatever it is, what is it?
[413:30.86]Vitamin.
[413:31.98]Take a vitamin!
[413:34.37]We'll just load you up with drugs.
[413:46.64]Gonna have a nice fresh salmon.
[413:58.52]Is Unprover doing good, or is he still lame?
[414:01.00]I mean, he's good, but I just don't have the time to really care about it.
[414:08.02]Roberto's dying, so we need to focus on Roberto completely.
[414:20.85]Save it.
[414:21.17]This is gonna get risky.
[414:34.35]Okay.
[414:35.90]We have two tournaments here.
[414:37.20]Coming up.
[414:38.86]You.
[414:39.22]Rest.
[414:39.94]You.
[414:41.64]It don't matter.
[414:43.62]Rest.
[414:46.22]You hit the book.
[414:48.72]And you... A bunch of sandbag for a little while.
[414:54.46]Hey, I remembered to save you.
[415:08.27]You got a tournament.
[415:10.38]Everyone's fine.
[415:15.46]Alright, Spyroid.
[415:22.98]The fresh green cup.
[415:26.76]Sounds tasty.
[415:28.36]Sounds healthy.
[415:41.89]Don't put Spyro on the rodeo.
[415:42.95]It lowers his intelligence.
[415:43.85]Well, we're not going to even get him close to rank B. If I can get him to C, I'll be happy, because then I can fuse him.
[415:50.83]This is all just to get a better stat when I combine the both of them eventually here.
[416:07.94]Whip!
[416:17.19]Rank A or bust baby speedrun.
[416:23.24]I don't even- I don't know if that's gonna get there tonight.
[416:25.61]Next time I play it, I will.
[416:26.71]UD?
[416:29.07]Why does she have a disk floating in front of her?
[416:56.02]Final guts!
[416:56.58]Yeah, sure, I'll do it again.
[417:03.16]Don't block that, give me a break.
[417:12.56]How does that hurt you?
[417:14.74]What?
[417:19.18]You just jump around in a circle and it did more damage than punching me.
[417:23.19]Alright, I'm...
[417:25.91]Come on.
[417:30.30]Jesus Christ, what the hell was that?
[417:34.86]Oh my god.
[417:35.60]No, stop!
[417:38.42]Go closer in.
[417:39.52]Hit this.
[417:43.20]Oh my god, don't even make me jump.
[418:02.07]I gotta stay ba- AHHHHHH I can't- I couldn't counter it in time.
[418:12.87]Seriously.
[418:13.63]Why?
[418:17.95]It's over.
[418:22.37]I have one HP.
[418:28.33]I have to block whatever it is.
[418:34.80]We both have one health.
[418:36.41]Except you unfairly got yours.
[418:38.21]DO IT!
[418:41.04]Oh my god, give me a fucking break.
[418:57.82]It was just a load of absolute bullshit.
[419:01.96]It's just bullshit.
[419:02.98]That's really all it is.
[419:04.68]It's just total bullshit.
[419:10.60]It's just so many of the game's mechanics fighting against me.
[419:27.11]Oh, I killed you in one hit.
[419:28.23]Oh my god.
[419:31.46]I think I lose.
[419:38.63]No, I win.
[419:40.23]I still won the tournament.
[419:55.01]Because UD accidentally beat me with... She rolled a 1 five to ten times in a row.
[420:06.58]No, by the way, this is like a 40-sided die.
[420:12.22]I accidentally lost to that character.
[420:19.42]Let's go to the calendar.
[420:22.83]There it is.
[420:24.33]Rank up.
[420:26.82]Then this is almost time to rank up.
[420:30.70]I'm so sick of it.
[420:31.94]I'm so sick of that.
[420:34.90]Okay, rest.
[420:35.96]You actually rest here.
[420:37.10]No more.
[420:39.61]No, no sandbag.
[420:41.63]Get on the life blade.
[420:42.69]More life.
[420:43.79]More.
[420:53.67]Did I get bit by a bug?
[420:54.75]I think I'm getting an itchy arm.
[421:14.38]No, psst.
[421:14.90]Mosquitoes out today?
[421:19.62]That means you're gonna get money soon.
[421:23.73]What?
[421:23.95]Are you sure I didn't get bit by a fly?
[421:36.31]Oh, I absolutely loved it!
[421:49.06]You haven't been singing in your Gway voice lately and it makes me sad.
[421:53.46]Gway?
[421:54.34]Gway?
[421:54.96]What is Gway?
[421:56.82]I haven't been singing in my Gway voice?
[422:14.18]Alright, spiroid.
[422:17.00]No one's got anything.
[422:19.20]This is tomorrow.
[422:21.70]And then we're close.
[422:22.78]We're close, we're close, we're close, we're close.
[422:24.36]We're really close.
[422:26.61]The throat noise?
[422:27.51]That, like what?
[422:43.14]Oh, I know what you're talking about, like... I know what you mean.
[422:46.20]Okay, let's see.
[422:46.88]Stream saved, he did it.
[423:12.76]What sort of genetic lottery did Roberto win to be born such a killing machine?
[423:18.59]It's scientifically proven that Skrillex's song, Scary Ghosts and Sprites, causes mosquitoes to stay away and stop having sex.
[423:29.23]Just, like, blast it.
[423:32.15]We should have a day.
[423:35.37]Where's the legislature?
[423:36.98]If that's true... Seriously, if that's true...
[423:42.11]then have a day dedicated to everywhere on Earth.
[423:46.64]You have to legally put a pair of speakers out your window and blast that song as loud as it can go.
[423:54.62]If that's true, then no mosquitoes will ever come back ever again.
[424:00.08]Why don't we blast it everywhere?
[424:12.68]And then they'll never have any offspring.
[424:18.32]And mosquitoes will go extinct.
[424:26.62]It confuses them.
[424:27.87]Alright, Lightblade.
[424:34.63]Fresh.
[424:37.45]This looks good to me.
[424:47.74]Where's the rock version of this song?
[424:50.51]The metal one.
[424:55.44]There's a fucking rock music song in this one.
[425:11.87]Alright.
[425:12.13]This is the last tournament here before... I can do the official one, and then... I'm probably gonna have to call it after this, because it's getting late.
[425:22.20]I'm going for more than seven hours now.
[425:24.56]Streaming tomorrow, too.
[425:26.30]So I do need to kind of get some rest.
[425:36.60]It really is a goblet, isn't it?
[425:40.72]Sothyril versus Roberto.
[425:42.84]Do I have a new... Ooh, that's high.
[425:44.98]468 health.
[425:45.56]Get out of here.
[425:51.73]When's the stream gonna start?
[425:54.11]Um... I don't know.
[425:59.81]Essentially... Probably around the same time.
[426:02.17]Between like... Like it always is.
[426:03.50]Between 3 and 4.
[426:04.04]Good start.
[426:15.18]And go.
[426:20.94]Yeah, I mean, I don't see why I wouldn't.
[426:26.63]This will be quick, though.
[426:27.21]I like when they just get it over with.
[426:30.95]It looks better this way.
[426:34.13]Blue versus Lily.
[426:35.11]Moody.
[426:45.29]Appliances versus Jinx.
[426:49.83]High 300s.
[426:54.65]Roberto is not dead yet.
[426:55.83]No, Roberto's still alive.
[427:00.94]Whoa.
[427:03.34]Robo-Bird?
[427:04.12]Sit down.
[427:17.13]It's so much easier when you have a Roberto.
[427:19.15]Alright, Moody.
[427:35.02]Nothing special.
[427:36.82]Just getting lucky, I think.
[427:48.49]It's one of these little bird things.
[428:01.18]Take me to Asterak.
[428:02.72]Just let me see.
[428:03.34]Get me there.
[428:04.12]I mean, it's pretty much done deal at this point.
[428:12.84]Is this even fun anymore?
[428:17.45]Yeah.
[428:18.57]Yes, because I'm gonna get to see S rank.
[428:22.49]Highest we got in Monster Rancher 2 was I think B is the highest I got to and that was hard.
[428:29.32]I'm just steamrolling people.
[428:35.86]Monster Rancher 2 was hard.
[428:46.45]Jerma's spending hours and hours here just to see the letter S. Well, that's not wrong.
[428:57.13]Okay, so then this is... Oh, come on, really?
[429:01.03]This is what I'm talking about.
[429:02.65]Now you tell me... I got another monster that needs to do a ranking, and I have to wait.
[429:08.53]Just look at this.
[429:09.05]I want you to just pay attention here, because this is why.
[429:11.21]What the fuck?
[429:12.35]Right?
[429:12.77]What the... What the hell?
[429:15.24]Official tournament, August, September, October is the next official tournament to rank one, one of these monsters up.
[429:30.01]I don't like that.
[429:31.01]What's going on with that?
[429:32.59]What the hell?
[429:47.00]Might as well just burn it up.
[429:50.62]And just get there.
[429:51.78]And I want to do one match in S to see what it's like.
[429:54.22]You did put it all on Roberto.
[430:03.71]I did, but that seems so spread out.
[430:07.09]For having this many monsters on the ranch.
[430:10.97]You can't have more than one official tournament in six months?
[430:13.82]Four months?
[430:25.25]I know I don't have to have more than one monster, but it's like fun.
[430:27.87]It's a cool mechanic, and I would like to enjoy it.
[430:34.56]Alright.
[430:36.22]Rest.
[430:39.08]Is the last thing I'll be able to do before this official tournament.
[430:41.18]Let's do... Let's do accuracy.
[430:45.92]We haven't done it in a while.
[430:46.84]Might as well just get it up a little bit more.
[430:48.00]Alright, let's go.
[430:52.08]Let's see it.
[431:02.39]They don't want to do official tournaments when they know you're just gonna come in and win anyways.
[431:11.14]I've just been giving him pills.
[431:18.93]Just freeze slop already.
[431:31.64]Where's the Roberto will win coffee pasta?
[431:36.87]It's funny how that was like a little meme two days ago, but it's actually true.
[431:42.17]I mean, that's true.
[431:47.70]It is.
[431:48.60]Almost there.
[432:09.09]He doesn't even need a copypasta.
[432:11.17]Copypasta.
[432:14.80]Target practice.
[432:16.50]There's a tournament.
[432:18.20]Lifeblade.
[432:18.92]Rest.
[432:19.44]You need to be fed.
[432:20.22]You don't even have anything.
[432:21.74]It's just automatic for, like, technique.
[432:25.24]Okay.
[432:45.95]We're gonna start to get banned.
[432:50.81]Here comes a R9K.
[433:01.38]You did this!
[433:04.14]Why would you want a potato?
[433:05.44]Fair enough, just eat it.
[433:25.61]Roberto's gonna die in 30 minutes.
[433:27.05]Might as well spam it while we can.
[433:28.69]I don't think he will.
[433:31.41]I think he's gonna be around for a lot longer than you think.
[433:42.88]I think he's gonna be just fine.
[433:48.20]Alright, tournament time.
[433:58.78]Beautiful life increase by Spyroid.
[434:04.48]Official rank A tournament.
[434:11.10]Give you some food.
[434:14.33]Carrot?
[434:18.76]Please stop.
[434:19.54]My laptop is heating up and it's burning my legs.
[434:21.68]This is it.
[434:40.33]Official League Grade A.
[434:45.61]The final barrier to rank S. Nash versus Roberto.
[434:52.27]Let's see.
[434:52.71]Who are the top?
[434:53.59]What's the cream of the crop here?
[434:55.71]Easy.
[434:57.44]I feel like Roberto is... I feel like Roberto's not supposed to be still alive.
[435:06.32]What?
[435:24.91]There's no reason for... I think Roberto's supposed to be dead.
[435:30.49]He's just one hit killing everybody still.
[435:41.76]He's not supposed to be alive still.
[435:43.28]He's unkillable.
[435:51.52]He could live another year.
[435:52.70]Am I just going to steamroll S and just beat the game tonight?
[435:57.28]That might happen.
[435:59.10]Who cares about the other monsters?
[436:00.28]Let's just win.
[436:00.82]I'm just going to kill everybody.
[436:07.38]This is view. 300...
[436:30.60]Alright.
[436:31.06]Alright.
[436:31.32]Get cocky.
[436:32.74]Uh-oh.
[436:33.78]Alright.
[436:34.28]Don't get cocky.
[436:35.53]Still very possible to lose.
[436:37.29]Very possible now.
[436:41.39]Alright.
[436:50.74]Hold back.
[436:54.26]No.
[436:58.02]Uh-oh.
[436:58.70]Alright, easy.
[437:00.02]That was so many guts damages.
[437:01.48]Whoa, boy.
[437:03.26]I gotta counter this.
[437:06.00]Oh, you motherfucker gave me a break.
[437:08.34]He's gonna lose.
[437:08.79]No, he's not.
[437:10.87]Hit it!
[437:13.45]Oh, not good.
[437:16.31]Yes!
[437:17.53]I fucking hate this game.
[437:36.23]Are you gonna die?
[437:47.43]God, why?
[437:48.13]I almost got killed by the troll doll.
[437:53.76]Alright, sunset.
[437:56.88]Look at those stats, and I almost died.
[437:58.30]Look at how bad the speed and intelligence is.
[438:00.42]Wow, I really am.
[438:01.36]Like the last cannon.
[438:05.43]Sunset Wow, that was fast Get in there
[438:38.94]Take that.
[438:40.94]Back it up.
[438:46.20]Don't blow the guts here.
[438:47.22]Alright, goodbye.
[439:02.73]Three down.
[439:04.95]Alright, Sun Louise.
[439:08.26]There are... I'm still undefeated.
[439:12.08]Three people here are undefeated.
[439:13.24]Let's see what happens here.
[439:13.92]Alright, this is gonna be tricky because 3-0, the top three.
[439:20.65]I'm gonna get RNG'd somehow.
[439:22.97]I know it.
[439:23.91]Sun Louise!
[439:26.07]Why are you so good?
[439:27.17]You aren't.
[439:27.81]It's probably your moveset.
[439:30.61]Tail Sting, Smoke Bomb.
[439:32.93]A whole lot of bullshit.
[439:36.94]Let the AI control it?
[439:38.04]No.
[439:39.36]The AI is so dumb.
[439:44.95]That's cool looking, though.
[439:50.45]Clean it up right now.
[439:56.27]Mmm, that's a good combo.
[439:57.25]Just gotta connect, that's it.
[440:07.23]Okay.
[440:07.95]Spartacus.
[440:09.57]Or Spartix.
[440:11.40]Spartax.
[440:15.74]Spartax versus... Okay, Spartax loses here.
[440:17.64]And that's a good game.
[440:21.22]Ooh.
[440:21.64]Who won?
[440:21.94]No.
[440:24.88]Alright.
[440:26.40]Spartax is really the only thing in the way.
[440:33.41]4-0 versus 4-0.
[440:34.45]It comes down to this.
[440:37.58]Huge accuracy.
[440:39.94]But... Just gotta land the attacks.
[440:50.51]Oh, you two came to Visley too!
[440:51.97]I had some important business here, so I dropped by.
[440:53.97]Figured I'd stop by to enjoy the competition near the old school.
[440:58.67]With rank A opponents, my Spartak should get some good exercise.
[441:01.93]Wait, you just came and joined the tournament?
[441:05.73]You were just going to the grocery store and you just had to stop and join mid-tournament at the end?
[441:10.19]What are you talking about?
[441:15.55]What a humblebrag.
[441:18.15]I just figured I was on the way to the store and I would enter the highest capable quality tournament in the world.
[441:39.25]Fuck.
[441:42.97]Block it.
[441:44.29]Oh, no!
[441:45.19]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[441:51.21]Bad.
[441:56.08]Come on.
[441:56.66]Come on, one more.
[441:57.34]One more.
[441:57.60]Do it right now.
[441:58.04]Double tap him right here.
[442:02.34]No!
[442:17.91]No, that's just... Dude, fuck.
[442:21.65]This stupid game mechanic.
[442:24.49]Where you just have to guess what move they're gonna do.
[442:29.07]Like, what the hell?
[442:30.08]I have to do this whole tournament again.
[442:31.68]Like, why would that be in the game?
[442:39.34]Just a 1 out of 3 chance to not get hit by a move.
[442:47.71]It really is rock, paper, scissors at the highest competitive level.
[442:51.86]There's this rock, paper, scissors at the Olympics.
[443:12.29]Did I save before?
[443:13.31]I don't want to do that again.
[443:14.51]Did I save right before that?
[443:18.10]Was it right before that happened?
[443:19.61]God damn it.
[443:20.35]I don't... Come on.
[443:26.54]I hate that.
[443:27.28]I don't...
[443:47.45]No, but I need to get to S rank, and then I'm gonna... Yeah, it is today.
[443:57.13]Alright, what can I do differently?
[443:58.33]How about this?
[444:01.03]Whatever, just go.
[444:01.69]Come on, just... Here comes choke too.
[444:08.70]No, I'm not gonna choke again.
[444:10.06]It's not even choke.
[444:14.46]It's just fucking whipping dice in the air.
[444:18.65]Alright, I'm gonna give the best food I can, uh... Why do they all want potatoes?
[444:22.54]Eat a watermelon.
[444:24.30]Nutrients.
[444:25.10]Focus.
[444:31.54]Lively, completely focused, and not tired at all.
[444:35.29]Let's go.
[444:49.49]Where's a good place to start the franchise?
[444:50.79]What do you think is the best?
[444:51.45]Monster Rancher 2.
[444:54.55]Is absolutely the best start, and it's probably the best game.
[444:58.78]You could probably just do Monster Rancher 2, and not any of the others.
[445:03.12]If I'm completely honest.
[445:04.47]Or maybe the DS one.
[445:05.83]I have not tried the DS one.
[445:22.06]This one's alright.
[445:23.00]No, this one's good.
[445:23.54]I like 2 more than 4.
[445:24.18]Yeah, I do.
[445:27.55]I do like... I mean, I wouldn't play this one for, like, 30 hours if I didn't like it.
[445:33.47]I do think 2 is a better game, though.
[445:37.33]I like 2's mechanics a little more.
[445:57.19]Alright, stay down.
[445:57.93]Let's go.
[446:05.56]You draw to make monsters in Monster Rancher DS?
[446:08.30]That's cool.
[446:20.05]So we're in the same timeline though, right?
[446:23.83]Does that mean that he'll do the same exact moves?
[446:43.72]Fucking lose right now.
[446:46.39]Block it!
[446:47.51]Oh my god.
[447:16.89]I can still do it.
[447:18.13]I can still do it.
[447:22.70]I can still do it.
[447:23.74]I just can't lose another one.
[447:47.09]I didn't even try okay fine I don't I'm fine everything's fine spartacus is the only one that's not that doesn't have a loss I'm just gonna get there oh my god he almost lost how did he almost lose I thought the patch was already written the ink is dry
[448:17.03]I thought that's what the case was!
[448:18.25]Okay.
[448:43.24]Things are looking up.
[448:44.94]I mean, the past is already written, the ink is dry, but I can do it.
[449:08.98]Alright.
[449:10.14]Spartacus versus Roberto.
[449:13.25]Go.
[449:14.83]Win this match, and I win the tournament, and I don't have to do this bullshit again.
[449:20.69]Oh, yeah.
[449:21.31]I'm on my way to the store.
[449:22.27]Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[449:23.23]Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[449:24.48]Let's go.
[449:44.77]99 fucking percent.
[449:49.08]99% chance to hit.
[449:52.36]What the hell?
[449:53.70]Go for it again.
[450:00.12]Get it.
[450:00.34]You missed.
[450:05.18]Fuck you, I win.
[450:11.77]100 speed!
[450:13.49]I know, but... I won.
[450:16.62]That has pulled a muscle in the front of my left shoulder.
[450:23.61]How did that happen?
[450:24.53]That hurt.
[450:34.64]The young breeders from Toggle.
[450:36.54]Fane and Ryo.
[450:38.06]These new champions will have a new trophy sent to them.
[450:40.04]Congratulations!
[450:43.34]Thank you very much.
[450:44.84]The trophy boasts an exotic gem unearthed at the ancient ruins of Promias.
[450:49.96]It's been a while.
[450:51.39]What the voice of the Gaia Stone.
[450:53.63]What is it, Ryo?
[450:55.15]The flow of darkness strengthens a hurry you must remember.
[450:58.49]You must protect humans from the very fate they are headed for by their own mistaken actions.
[451:05.51]This is the human-monster war that's incoming, right?
[451:10.47]Of 2040 AD.
[451:11.17]I was thinking about it.
[451:21.89]What is it, Rio?
[451:23.01]Rio!
[451:24.82]Oh my, quick, bring a stretcher!
[451:32.47]Where am I?
[451:34.03]Rio.
[451:35.65]You fainted on stage.
[451:36.65]That was a real scare.
[451:39.35]This is the school nurse station.
[451:41.62]But what in the world happened to you?
[451:43.50]Could you tell me?
[451:45.42]Yes, well, you see... A voice from a stone in a frightful sight.
[451:49.00]That's all very strange.
[451:51.80]The Promeas Ruins, where the stone was dug up, contains many unsolved mysteries.
[451:57.13]Perhaps if you checked into it, we may get to the bottom of things.
[452:01.23]Promias ruins, huh?
[452:02.43]Let's go.
[452:03.57]But Ryu, have you recovered okay?
[452:06.23]I'm fine now.
[452:07.19]It was just a little shock.
[452:09.37]And I can't just lie around here.
[452:10.89]Let's go.
[452:12.23]Okay, then it's off to the ruins of Promias.
[452:16.26]No, I'm not doing that.
[452:19.00]I just want to do one match in Rank S to see what it looks like and then turn the stream off.
[452:33.98]I just want to smell the air.
[452:37.44]In the Rank S Tournament.
[452:40.84]Look at this shit.
[452:46.77]Here we go.
[452:48.63]Sign up for us today.
[452:49.46]Let's go.
[453:09.61]I didn't save.
[453:10.07]I don't think I can.
[453:21.09]I can smell the game.
[453:22.87]It doesn't matter.
[453:23.71]This is one and done.
[453:29.65]Whatever, you're fine.
[453:31.41]You're fine.
[453:32.05]Where's Roberto?
[453:34.13]Roberto?
[453:37.67]Why are you doing this?
[453:39.27]You should be resting.
[453:39.95]I just want to see.
[453:45.33]If he dies, I die.
[453:47.05]What is that?
[453:49.07]Whatever.
[453:53.02]Rank S. I just want to see it.
[453:55.44]Don't knock over everything.
[453:56.72]Arcadia.
[454:01.70]Arcadia.
[454:07.47]Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the Arcadia Cup.
[454:10.69]Who will arise victorious?
[454:12.01]There can only be one.
[454:13.59]Now let tournament begin.
[454:16.36]Goldie.
[454:19.54]Holy shit.
[454:32.73]Well, that was a big increase in difficulty.
[454:40.76]What the hell?
[454:41.40]Their circle encompasses my circle.
[454:45.02]This is bad.
[454:45.56]Look at these hit chances.
[454:48.28]Uh-oh.
[455:21.38]Zero percent?
[455:23.18]Zero?
[455:24.40]Zero.
[455:33.77]Well, that's one way to do it.
[455:38.17]Okay.
[455:48.05]Rudolph versus Maximill.
[455:51.09]We don't even need to see this shit.
[455:52.61]Goldie?
[455:52.99]Look at how power- Goldie's impossible.
[455:56.49]What is this nonsense?
[455:57.55]Okay, Ogre versus Goldie.
[456:05.76]Look, it's not even fair!
[456:17.88]I lost 11 fans.
[456:20.97]11% of my fame is gone.
[456:25.05]What a bunch of fucking assholes.
[456:27.05]Not even true fans.
[456:29.07]I one-hit KO'd 99 out of 100 monsters.
[456:33.35]And 11 people are like, yeah, I don't like this guy anymore.
[456:35.75]He didn't win.
[456:43.93]You really gonna hang up the towel there that quickly?
[457:13.65]He's still alive.
[457:15.71]Just in case something horrible happens.
[457:25.22]Alright, I need to get you where I put the calendar.
[457:34.72]Look at this nonsense.
[457:38.04]Let me wait four months for another... No.
[457:42.49]I'm gonna call it here.
[457:43.09]I'm gonna call it tonight.
[457:45.95]I'm going for just about eight hours.
[457:49.71]I did not expect that.
[457:50.43]That was a huge ramp up in difficulty there.
[457:56.48]So I had one stat that was really good.
[457:58.22]It's like 89 intellect, 106 speed.
[458:03.04]Dude, you gotta use people.
[458:05.32]Rank S is the actual video game.
[458:16.64]But I'll call it here, that's it.
[458:19.16]Before it gets too late.
[458:24.70]So, on Monster Rancher 4, we will probably do... Like I said, tomorrow is Risk of Rain 2 with the Talics.
[458:32.79]Saturday is the Sekiro scratch-off and Jerm Slots.
[458:36.95]And then, next week, like Tuesday or something, whenever I... Tuesday, Wednesday, whenever I come back next week...
[458:45.73]We're probably gonna do... Hmm, what do we do next week?
[458:50.92]Should we start with this?
[458:53.72]Yeah, it's still, it's in everybody's mind now.
[458:56.12]After this next couple days, after I take a couple of, like, two, three days off after the weekend, we will come back.
[459:03.11]And we will play this a little more, Mr. Mosquito.
[459:08.23]and Shadow of Rome.
[459:10.15]After that, I don't think there's gonna be more than a couple days.
[459:14.14]Those three games combined might even be one stream.
[459:17.52]VR is gonna come back after that.
[459:20.18]We'll do a whole week or two of more VR.
[459:22.77]I wanna do some more multiplayer VR, I wanna do Mind Show, actually do Mind Show.
[459:30.35]There's still a ton of content in VR that I have not done.
[459:38.13]But for the immediate future, Risk of Rain 2 tomorrow co-op.
[459:43.72]Looks like a really fun game.
[459:44.64]Everyone seems to love it.
[459:46.52]Etalyx brought it up and it's like, yeah, let's just try it.
[459:48.58]Let's see how good it is.
[459:51.02]I'll see you tomorrow.
[459:52.70]Thanks for watching.
[459:54.16]Take care.
[459:57.58]Monster Rancher 4 will return for at least somewhat of a... There will be a conclusion.
[460:04.64]Roberto's still alive.
[460:07.32]There's still a fuse potential here.
[460:09.52]There will be a conclusion to Monster Rancher 4.
[460:14.94]But, that's gonna be the time.
[460:18.14]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[460:20.11]Take care of yourselves.
[460:20.71]We're gonna do the bits.
[460:23.57]If you're taking off, see you soon.
[460:25.07]Labo VR is another thing.
[460:26.33]There's a lot of stuff going on.
[460:28.85]Other things, other projects.
[460:34.12]There's plenty to do.
[460:37.86]Let's head back to earlier today.
[460:42.22]Just about eight hours ago.
[460:44.83]Mandum Requiem, thanks for the $12.
[460:48.07]No message, just $12.
[460:48.95]Thank you so much.
[460:50.53]Dork Cube, thanks for the $2.50.
[460:51.47]Wait a second, guys.
[460:52.77]What if Jerma doesn't know all this stuff about anime because he's a huge weeb, but rather it's because Jerma himself is in anime?
[461:04.14]Um, well, that's a debate that you guys can have without me involved, because it's about me.
[461:12.24]I don't know.
[461:13.52]I have no comment there.
[461:15.77]Master of Ceremonies, thanks for the $5.
[461:18.31]They say, Hyper Beam.
[461:19.79]I don't know what that means.
[461:22.21]I don't know what that is, but thank you for the $10 here.
[461:24.63]$5 again for Master of Ceremonies.
[461:27.07]Is there a way to refund bits?
[461:28.59]I didn't think my hard-earned money was going to a Weeb streamer.
[461:36.65]Well, you gave five more, you gave five dollars on top of that.
[461:40.81]Also, before everybody goes, I want to say thanks to Kryken for the raid.
[461:44.48]If you were still sticking around from Kryken stream, thank you.
[461:47.96]Maybe we'll see you again soon.
[461:53.12]But thank you to Master of Ceremonies for the ten bucks.
[461:58.23]Manboy, thank you, Manboy, for the 250.
[462:00.31]Jeremy, you can't hide your wee ways now.
[462:02.01]I found your MyAnimeList.
[462:06.87]AnimeLover985.
[462:07.97]Well, I mean, you clearly just made that account and did that.
[462:15.53]Appreciate the $2.50, though.
[462:25.84]Thank you, Manboy.
[462:26.42]$7, $7, $7?
[462:29.32]Jess, you got it, thanks for the 250.
[462:31.76]So, there is a species of shrimp that has 16 cones in its eyes.
[462:35.66]We have three, red, blue, and green.
[462:39.08]With 16 cones, that's about 500 primary and secondary tertiary colors.
[462:44.80]How fucked is that?
[462:46.91]That's weird.
[462:50.21]You just can't, there's no way to know what that looks like.
[462:55.35]So why hasn't science come up with a way to, like, clone that?
[462:59.42]Okay, a shrimp is a shrimp, right?
[463:03.67]We don't have a way to find out with their genetic DNA and their code how that happens and how we can't, you know, get eyes, cover our brain with eyes.
[463:13.97]Why can't we do that?
[463:18.23]Our eyes have yet to open.
[463:20.82]I don't know how we can figure that out.
[463:30.65]Thank you, Jess.
[463:31.13]You got it.
[463:31.45]I don't know.
[463:33.39]I don't think so.
[463:33.81]Etalyx played that game and he told me that it was...
[464:00.65]It was a kind of a brutal game.
[464:03.51]That... was kind of... maybe would be fun with two people?
[464:09.80]But maybe not, I don't think.
[464:11.20]It's not in the cards right now.
[464:16.58]Would you beat Dark Souls?
[464:17.44]Well, I mean, isn't that game like you start with Kenshi?
[464:21.24]With a dodge roll?
[464:25.56]We'll see.
[464:26.18]It's not in the plans.
[464:30.94]Does look interesting, though.
[464:32.46]Talk about outward.
[464:35.54]Holy shit, he didn't say, I'll look into it.
[464:37.28]I'll check it out.
[464:40.10]But thank you, though.
[464:41.88]Also, thank you to... Void01 for the $2.50, the $2.50.
[464:49.17]Jerma, update on that TF2 item based on your hair.
[464:51.61]It's getting close to being done and we're having some troubles figuring out the side and back views.
[464:58.35]Can we get a facecam reference?
[464:59.69]I, uh, actually, I don't have clothes on.
[465:03.56]So I cannot turn the facecam on.
[465:06.64]I'll give you some references, uh, on Saturday, because I'll be on facecam the whole time.
[465:13.60]You'll see me Saturday.
[465:15.06]On camera.
[465:17.46]Ass slap incoming.
[465:18.64]Nope, those are pants.
[465:24.43]But thank you, Void.
[465:27.42]Uh, Zalasky, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[465:30.28]Thank you, Zalasky.
[465:30.92]Uh, and it is a Giazio.
[465:35.70]Is it linked to a rock?
[465:38.29]Oh, this is a giant SpongeBob coin rock thing.
[465:40.49]Okay.
[465:45.19]We were talking about... I got off on some weird tangents.
[465:50.95]Sometimes we just go... Just start talking about random nonsense.
[465:56.84]But thank you, Zalasky, for the 10 bucks.
[466:01.78]Appreciate it.
[466:03.50]Honeychain, thanks for the 250.
[466:04.72]Don't you hate it when you buy an ice-cold Arizona, open it up, take a sip, and it's actually PVR?
[466:10.89]I hate when that happens.
[466:16.67]Thank you for the 250.
[466:17.49]Thank you, Frody and Weapon, for the 250.
[466:19.15]Enjoy your two-and-a-half Arizona green teas.
[466:22.49]I will.
[466:26.53]Who drinks their money?
[466:27.95]It was an elaborate conversation.
[466:31.10]I wouldn't even... I can't even describe how that conversation even happened.
[466:34.38]Just did.
[466:37.62]Something or other, thanks for the $2.50.
[466:38.74]Hey, Jerma, bank just called and apparently everything is wrong.
[466:41.98]I'm going to start paying for bits in cash.
[466:44.38]You'll get the first envelope in two to three weeks.
[466:48.07]Cash?
[466:48.31]Paying with cash?
[466:50.87]Where'd you get that cash from?
[466:57.95]You carry that guy?
[466:58.57]You carry cash?
[466:59.57]I like the painting cash.
[467:00.83]Oh, interesting.
[467:02.39]Why?
[467:02.87]That's weird.
[467:06.61]Hey, Meef Playbull, thanks for the 250.
[467:08.30]Monster Energy Blood and Basil.
[467:10.72]Five stars.
[467:16.44]Mithril Bong, thanks for the five dollars.
[467:18.32]Hey, Jeremy just wanted to say, go fuck your hat.
[467:24.28]Fuck my hat.
[467:26.20]I'm not wearing a hat, but...
[467:28.97]Thanks to the five dolls.
[467:33.61]I'm hatless today.
[467:35.76]Hatless yesterday.
[467:39.36]But thank you, Mithril Bong, for the five bucks.
[467:42.53]Snoozencopter, thanks for the $2.50.
[467:43.99]Your story reminded me of something.
[467:45.41]One day my mom was doing garden work outside, and when she came back in and told me, she was hearing scratching sounds in her ear, and asked me to take one of those ear magnifying glasses to take a look.
[467:56.98]So I did, and I didn't see anything until a spider came crawling at me.
[468:02.46]Imagine looking at a spider through a magnifying glass.
[468:05.54]It's huge, and you could see the eyes and the hairs.
[468:07.80]It was like a jump scare.
[468:12.17]That's... That's un-fucking-believable.
[468:19.60]Your mother had a spider in her ear canal?
[468:27.91]What?
[468:35.73]That's what happens in the first hour of a horror movie.
[468:39.21]When the main character thinks that something's wrong, they got, like, cursed or grabbed by, like, the witch or something, and then she goes to the, or they go to the doctor, or he goes to the doctor, and... No, the witch doesn't go to the doctor.
[468:50.00]Well, sure, the witch can go to the doctor, too.
[468:51.60]That's fine.
[468:52.06]You know, I grabbed somebody.
[468:53.24]I think I gave him something.
[468:57.79]But the doctor does that.
[468:59.51]That's the part of the horror movie where it starts to really turn for the worse.
[469:08.71]What a scary movie.
[469:13.07]That's fucked up though.
[469:15.05]If that's true, that's fucking insane.
[469:18.37]Jerma lied about 5k subs thanks to the 250.
[469:21.37]You did change your name though, I will give you credit.
[469:25.59]Hey Jerma, have you heard of a game called Digimon World Championship?
[469:30.03]I had it as a kid and it's like this game but you can't control your monsters in battle.
[469:33.65]You might want to check it out if you like these games.
[469:35.55]We talked about it a couple days ago.
[469:47.30]He did lie, but it was April Fool's.
[469:50.31]It's not a lie if it's April Fool's.
[469:52.57]It's an April Fool's gag.
[470:00.77]Wait, wait, wait.
[470:01.23]There's two Jerma lied now.
[470:03.19]That's not the person changing their name?
[470:11.40]How many of these are there?
[470:19.82]That's funny.
[470:20.22]No, I can't.
[470:21.70]I can't.
[470:21.96]It's too late.
[470:22.44]I'm too tired.
[470:22.86]There.
[470:23.04]That's one of the workers.
[470:41.77]Hey Pin, thanks for the $2.50.
[470:42.83]Hey Jerma, been having some serious heart issues due to my ADHD medication.
[470:47.42]Despite the fact that I took the lowest dose, I made the decision to taper off of it.
[470:52.52]It's hard to live with ADHD, especially because I got a taste of what it was like to just think clearly, and for the most part, be normal.
[470:59.75]I'm frustrated that nothing in my life seems to go well, and every time I try to do something to improve my life, it ends up making things worse.
[471:05.57]It's been rough.
[471:08.37]I had a similar scenario.
[471:10.71]When I was younger, I was on... I was prescribed Ritalin and Adderall when I was like 16, 15.
[471:19.54]And I didn't like the way it made me feel.
[471:22.64]So I tapered off it and I stopped taking it.
[471:27.58]But yeah, that was when I was probably in high school.
[471:30.25]Like junior high, maybe.
[471:31.61]Like 14, 15.
[471:31.81]Yeah.
[471:34.35]No, I wasn't on both at the same time.
[471:35.65]I was on one and then transitioned to the other one.
[471:38.27]But I didn't really like it.
[471:40.21]My appetite dropped.
[471:45.08]I wasn't eating a lot when I was taking Adderall.
[471:50.44]So I tapered off it and stopped doing it.
[471:54.54]But hopefully, in my case at least...
[471:58.19]I just kind of tried to work around it.
[472:02.63]Figure out what I was good at doing in the time that my brain would focus on it.
[472:13.89]And so far, I mean, I'm in my 30s now.
[472:18.56]I'm doing alright.
[472:19.12]I'm doing okay with it.
[472:19.80]I mean, you guys know me pretty well at this point.
[472:25.48]Sometimes, like, it's just... It'll crop up that, like, holy shit.
[472:29.42]Just all over the place.
[472:31.63]But you know, it is what it is.
[472:37.51]But hopefully you can figure it out.
[472:38.99]Because it does take time to figure that out.
[472:43.97]And sometimes, sometimes it'd be, like you said, low dosages.
[472:47.61]Low dosage of medicines.
[472:48.43]You know, sometimes...
[472:53.28]You do have to get on something to kind of start to get better or feel better.
[472:58.20]And that's fine.
[473:08.52]I really hope you get it sorted out soon, though.
[473:11.70]Because it can be difficult to work with.
[473:18.42]CBD helps my bad anxiety issues.
[473:22.66]Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of research and data going into like CBD, things that it can do, the benefits.
[473:32.37]That's a conversation for your doctor, though.
[473:34.83]And a lot of doctors are really warming up to the fact that that's a possibility.
[473:44.87]But I wish you the best of luck.
[473:49.45]We also had 283, $2.83 from Errolis.
[473:52.87]There's a Jex wallpaper here on Reddit.
[473:59.78]I told you that that was the screenshot, right?
[474:03.96]Why do you have to always use the pic- Why do you guys always have to use this fucking picture?
[474:07.74]Where I'm making the face with the crazy eyes?
[474:12.51]There's so many different images you could use.
[474:15.15]It has to be the one with my crazy bug eyes.
[474:24.92]It's a classic.
[474:28.93]Thank you, errorless, for the 283 and the image.
[474:33.63]Krosky, now I have 370 images of you.
[474:38.59]I've got a folder of you.
[474:43.51]That's what you look like.
[474:44.69]I know, but still.
[474:46.44]PikaBanana, thanks for the 250.
[474:47.24]They just said, jermaHeart, thank you so much.
[474:51.83]Felix Phillips, thanks for the three bucks.
[474:54.23]You're great.
[474:56.37]Thank you, Felix, for the three dollars and the incredibly nice message.
[475:00.52]You're great, too.
[475:01.14]Thank you.
[475:03.88]Let's get the credits rolling here.
[475:11.76]Thank you so much, everybody.
[475:14.00]All the community subs given tonight.
[475:15.34]All the resubs.
[475:16.16]All the new subs.
[475:18.22]All of you.
[475:18.66]Thank you.
[475:24.54]Finally, we had Tyler Mike came in with $2.50.
[475:26.72]Hey, Jerbo.
[475:28.80]Just want to let you know, Ace Attorney for PC releases on Tuesday.
[475:33.74]Obviously, you have a lot of stuff planned at this point.
[475:35.50]Just making sure it's on the list.
[475:37.02]It is.
[475:37.20]Those are going to be some just relaxing streams.
[475:42.94]Kind of like the Monster Rancher streams, where we just kind of hang out, talk a lot of shit, have a good time.
[475:52.41]Those will just be fun little chill streams.
[476:00.31]But that's going to have to be after the VR.
[476:04.81]Because I do want to get through some more of that.
[476:06.15]I've had the itch for VR.
[476:10.97]And that's it.
[476:11.41]Thank you everybody for the bits.
[476:15.23]See you all tomorrow.
[476:17.73]More puking.
[476:21.39]When did I puke?
[476:23.61]I mean, I almost puked on the Sekiro stream.
[476:29.47]Hey, should, should Sekiro have an easy mode?
[476:31.77]I don't know, maybe, I don't think so, but you know, ask the guy that almost threw up because it was too hard.
[476:36.69]I think that's, I mean, it almost happened.
[476:48.97]Yeah, the Jaws game too, but that was because of motion sickness.
[476:55.89]I was also sick too.
[476:58.48]Trying not to use a walkthrough on Ace Attorney.
[477:01.60]No, I got plenty of walkthroughs here.
[477:05.75]They chat in the chat room.
[477:08.35]You guys can help me.
[477:12.27]I'll put like a timer on the screen for if I can't figure the case out, then you guys will just tell me the answer.
[477:17.51]We'll make a game out of it.
[477:20.43]I'll give myself like 20 minutes per case.
[477:22.96]And if I just can't do it, then like, okay guys, help me.
[477:34.47]20 minutes.
[477:35.91]Watch the anime instead.
[477:43.57]That might be better.
[477:47.74]What do I got here?
[477:50.22]I gotta clean up this desk.
[477:52.38]My desk is covered in PlayStation 2 games and cases and discs and everything.
[478:04.48]Each case is an entire stream after the tutorial.
[478:07.90]Really?
[478:11.02]Am I getting myself into something that's going to be over my head here?
[478:22.65]Yeah.
[478:23.93]Nah.
[478:26.65]Nah.
[478:27.12]Okay.
[478:29.96]Alright.
[478:30.24]Well, that's going to be it.
[478:31.70]I'll see you guys tomorrow for Risk of Rain 2.
[478:35.69]Gonna check it out.
[478:39.52]And after that, see you on Saturday.
[478:43.00]That's all.
[478:44.58]Take care.
[478:45.72]We went a little late tonight, but that's good.
[478:48.52]I mean, it's not good, but... It's all good.
[478:51.84]That's what I meant to say.
[478:52.50]It's all good.
[478:58.19]And I'm gonna sit here.
[478:59.77]Because it's almost eight hours.
[479:01.49]And you know me.
[479:03.63]It's, uh, 7.59.19 right now, so I gotta sit here for 40 seconds?
[479:07.65]Wait till it's 8 hours so I can turn it off.
[479:13.93]Good night.
[479:16.19]Awkward goodbye streamer.
[479:17.53]Eh, okay, uh, yep, see ya.
[479:20.33]Yeah, see ya, okay.
[479:24.03]Run ads.
[479:24.81]No, I'm not running ads.
[479:27.37]I'll run ads tomorrow.
[479:30.45]I'll run ads tomorrow at the end of tomorrow's stream.
[479:42.40]30 minute ad.
[479:44.28]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[479:45.56]Fine, fine, fine.
[479:46.08]Alright, here you go.
[479:46.88]I'm giving you 30 seconds.
[479:47.87]Here's one 30 second ad.
[479:48.51]That's it.
[479:48.95]I'm out.
[479:51.31]I promised.
[479:51.81]Alright, here's 30 seconds.
[479:54.57]Why do you guys have to beg me for ads?
[479:56.83]This feels wrong on every level.
[480:03.68]Alright, see you in 30 seconds.
[480:06.10]Those of you that don't want to see this, see you tomorrow.
[480:09.36]Here we go.
[480:17.13]It's running.
[480:21.91]Woohoo, ads.
[480:26.55]I can't see the ads, term of Pluto.
[480:32.55]Okay, if a marketing person saw this chat, you know how many emails I would receive from various companies if they saw the timestamps for these chat messages?
[480:51.14]Holy shit.
[480:51.68]Do you see that audience of people that are all begging for advertisements and to be marketed to?
[480:57.11]Hey, Jerma985, what's going on, man?
[480:59.09]I work for XYZ Company, and we really want to do a thing with you.
[481:02.27]Maybe play some ads at the end of your stream?
[481:04.93]Alright, people should be coming back now.
[481:17.78]Alright.
[481:19.12]Welcome back.
[481:24.73]I'll see you tomorrow.
[481:25.91]Take care, guys.
[481:27.11]Hey, thanks for watching the ad.
[481:31.25]Good night.
