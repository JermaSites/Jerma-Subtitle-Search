[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.63]I can't figure out... There's a song... I got a song caught in my head.
[00:10.67]I can't figure out what the fuck it is.
[00:13.27]In like three days.
[00:14.01]Hey, how you doing?
[00:21.55]Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[00:22.61]I hope you... Hey, how you doing?
[00:24.27]Let's reset.
[00:25.45]Hey, how you doing?
[00:28.49]Can we hear more than three notes?
[00:30.77]I don't know any of the... I don't know any of the other notes.
[00:37.44]When is Strawberry Magic 2?
[00:39.68]You know... Uh, you know that was made up.
[00:44.30]People got my hopes up so bad.
[00:51.40]There is no Strawberry Magic 2, guys.
[00:53.30]It doesn't exist.
[00:55.28]It's not real.
[01:00.81]Yeah.
[01:03.27]It's not real.
[01:03.87]I looked for it.
[01:11.37]But yeah, I'll give you the plan for the next week here of streaming content.
[01:20.99]Just kind of in pre-stream 30-40 minutes ago.
[01:25.41]Came up with a little bit of a plan.
[01:27.28]We're going to play Wobbled Dogs.
[01:33.84]For now.
[01:35.72]If the game's fun, then cool, we'll stick with it.
[01:39.04]If after an hour or two I'm like, meh.
[01:41.98]And we'll move on to the card game.
[01:44.04]Mon... Monbozo?
[01:46.98]Monbozo?
[01:49.82]If I think Wobble Dogs is a lot of fun, then we'll just do Monbozo later this week.
[01:56.40]Monbozo... I don't know how to say it.
[02:02.13]Strawberry Magic 2 doesn't exist.
[02:04.67]All the people coming in here... I know, the last thing we did was Strawberry Magic.
[02:08.13]It's fresh in everybody's mind.
[02:09.61]It's fresh in my mind, too.
[02:12.23]Because I had like three or four nightmares about it.
[02:16.63]It's been fresh since we did that stream.
[02:18.96]Can you make a Civ 5 reference?
[02:26.93]Um.
[02:28.57]I have never played any of the Civilization games.
[02:32.95]Wait, that's not true.
[02:34.35]I downloaded Civ Rev on iPad, I think, because it was the easy one.
[02:40.50]And I didn't even make it through the tutorial.
[02:43.08]I was just like, no, I don't care.
[02:44.60]I don't want to do this.
[02:48.69]Oh, let me move my mic.
[02:49.37]Give me a second.
[03:04.40]Why does everybody keep saying Morbius?
[03:07.86]What's the deal here?
[03:09.40]What's Morbius?
[03:10.21]Why are you saying... Well, I know what Morbius is, but what do you... Why do you keep saying it?
[03:12.99]Is that the new thing now?
[03:18.81]Alright.
[03:20.09]Would I like... Oh!
[03:25.60]My whole body's fucked up.
[03:27.72]Okay.
[03:27.82]Okay.
[03:28.51]What I'd like you to do now, I'd like you to move over to your calendar, whatever your calendar app of your choice is.
[03:35.16]I'd like you to scroll over to July.
[03:36.98]And I would like you to mark on your character sheet, on your July sheet, I would like for you to mark July 14th for the baseball stream.
[03:52.65]July 14th is the baseball stream.
[03:54.73]Don't have a time yet, but it'll be probably in the afternoon.
[04:03.31]Here is your hard date.
[04:04.35]It is set in stone.
[04:05.15]It is not changing.
[04:08.29]Unless something... Obviously, like, of course, it could.
[04:10.96]But that's the date that we have picked.
[04:13.22]That's what it's gonna be.
[04:20.06]What if it rains?
[04:21.34]Well, I... Oh my god, don't scare the shit out of me.
[04:24.26]Why are they doing it in the rain?
[04:25.98]They play baseball games in the rain all the time.
[04:32.32]Networking Andy?
[04:34.96]How... This is not Networking Andy.
[04:36.70]You've known about this show for two years.
[04:38.56]I just haven't been able to do it.
[04:39.50]Hold on.
[04:40.94]I gotta clear my throat.
[04:41.76]Give me a sec.
[04:42.08]I don't know what's going on.
[04:54.59]My throat's so fucked up all the time.
[04:57.59]But... Yeah.
[04:59.23]Yeah.
[04:59.73]There's going to be a lot of interesting stuff on that stream.
[05:02.73]I think that stream is going to be one of my most favorite streams ever.
[05:07.51]I know I say that every time there's an event stream and I know that I sound like a fucking 80 year old.
[05:11.71]Hey, hey kids.
[05:13.89]I know.
[05:16.17]You know, they actually turn out that way.
[05:17.67]It's weird.
[05:23.13]Every show that I've done over the last like two years has been like my favorite stream.
[05:27.39]So I don't know.
[05:27.84]We'll see if that trend continues.
[05:33.32]I think it's going to be fun.
[05:40.51]But yeah, there's your date.
[05:43.45]The Jerma Baseball Association.
[05:47.55]July 14th.
[05:48.53]Mark it again.
[05:52.61]You sound like you've been taking non-stop bong rips.
[05:56.20]I don't smoke weed.
[05:58.26]I don't smoke it.
[06:02.71]Well, get out of here.
[06:10.63]Will the pencil be at Jerma Baseball?
[06:12.75]No.
[06:15.35]Why on Earth would the pencil show up at that stream?
[06:19.87]I mean, I'm not going to tell you what's going to happen on that stream, because I think it's going to be fun.
[06:24.14]You already know some of it.
[06:25.98]But, uh, as, uh, oh, as Oski had to say, get hype.
[06:33.81]Is Barf Drinker gonna be there?
[06:43.75]I saw you at MGM Grand yesterday.
[06:45.81]No, you did not.
[06:48.13]I'm just telling you, you didn't.
[06:59.46]Will the stream be at 420?
[07:00.34]No.
[07:03.73]Are you going to get big poppy?
[07:06.11]No.
[07:08.75]Alright, that's all.
[07:09.51]What was his announcement?
[07:11.24]We're not talking about anything.
[07:12.34]Any details?
[07:14.48]Let's move over here and let's play Wobble Dogs.
[07:16.52]That's what they're starting with today.
[07:19.56]I promise my voice will get better.
[07:20.94]If it doesn't, then it's over.
[07:27.59]I don't get it.
[07:29.21]Let's go.
[07:32.31]Yeah, hope you're doing well.
[07:33.11]Hope things are going good.
[07:35.29]Move over here.
[07:35.88]Uh, this is... I don't even know what the hell this game is.
[07:38.54]I know it's a game where you have... You take care of dogs.
[07:42.52]And they wobble around.
[07:43.40]Is it... I just read the title.
[07:47.56]I read the title of the book and then went to the book club and pretended that I read the book.
[07:53.57]That was always the worst fucking thing, by the way.
[07:55.33]Can I just real quickly say...
[07:59.40]It's been a long time since I've been in high school or college or whatever.
[08:03.06]But I do remember specifically getting the reading assignment.
[08:08.52]And it was like, okay, we're going to go from page 150 to 190.
[08:14.67]And we're going to have a class discussion about it tomorrow, right?
[08:19.11]And we're just not reading it.
[08:20.63]And then having to have the teacher be like, okay, so when this happened, what do you think was really going through their mind?
[08:28.38]Explain that.
[08:28.78]What do you think happened there?
[08:30.28]Whatever the thing was.
[08:32.74]And yeah, somebody said it, but I'm going to reiterate it.
[08:35.74]I would pick up clues from what... If you were the first to get called, it's over.
[08:40.19]You're fucked.
[08:41.37]Right?
[08:41.97]Because then you have to be like...
[08:44.67]But I, uh... My hamster needed... I didn't take care of my hamster a lot and I didn't read it.
[08:51.46]But if two or three people went before you, you could kind of pick up the Wikipedia article of what happened in those 30 pages.
[09:01.10]And then just kind of go for it and be like, well, you know, I do think...
[09:06.69]When Lenny showed up.
[09:09.21]And I'll tell you right now, that story.
[09:13.57]In the barn.
[09:15.09]And when he was picking the hay up.
[09:17.63]I think it spoke to society in general.
[09:20.93]And how we can handle things.
[09:23.20]And spark notes.
[09:27.22]Dude, I'm not kidding.
[09:29.62]Don't take this as a thing you should do.
[09:31.42]Don't be a fucking idiot like I am.
[09:34.49]I think I wrote an entire paper of a book I didn't read before.
[09:39.11]I did not read the book at all, and I wrote a whole paper about it.
[09:42.56]And I didn't even, like, read the cliff notes or spark notes or whatever.
[09:46.10]I just wrote a paper about just... It was just a bunch of vague shit that I said about the book.
[09:51.64]I got a D, but I passed it.
[09:57.85]I got a D on that paper.
[09:58.99]It was like a D+.
[10:01.33]And there was a shitload of red ink circled being like, what do you mean by this?
[10:04.99]I think the teacher might have, like, felt bad.
[10:08.67]That, like, I just couldn't, I didn't fucking get it or something.
[10:13.58]But I wrote an entire paper, like a, like an eight to ten page paper on a book I did not read.
[10:20.16]Don't fucking do that.
[10:21.22]Don't be an idiot.
[10:22.00]Like, take that stuff seriously.
[10:25.70]But to be fair, the stuff that, in school, that I did take seriously, that I cared about, I took very seriously.
[10:33.31]It was just like a vague kind of anecdotal random stuff about how I felt about the book.
[10:44.71]What classes did you take seriously?
[10:46.09]I thought science was really cool.
[10:48.09]I always paid attention in science.
[10:51.59]Math?
[10:52.15]No.
[10:53.19]I couldn't do it.
[10:53.79]I just couldn't do it.
[10:55.96]I did enough where I could pass the classes and, like, you know, whatever, do the worksheets and try to get at least, like, passed in grade, plus C, whatever, on the test, whatever.
[11:04.35]But I was, I loved science.
[11:07.67]I was, I thought it was great.
[11:10.23]BatChest.
[11:12.07]Don't BatChest me because I like science.
[11:13.99]I, that's not, okay, fine.
[11:19.28]Oh, I love science.
[11:20.60]BatChest.
[11:21.20]Okay.
[11:25.59]Alright, alright, alright.
[11:28.19]Okay.
[11:30.22]We're gonna play Wobble Dogs.
[11:35.02]Um, what else did I like in high school?
[11:37.77]I thought, uh...
[11:41.65]You know what?
[11:41.93]I liked logic.
[11:42.93]I thought logic was really cool.
[11:45.05]Like if, then, therefore.
[11:47.11]It was like a math problem with language, with words.
[11:49.31]It was really actually kind of cool.
[11:50.77]Logic was actually really cool.
[11:52.92]If you have an opportunity to take, and I'm not fucking around, this is not a joke.
[11:56.48]If you're in high school or if you're going into college or if you're in college right now, if logic is available, take it.
[12:02.90]It's really cool.
[12:09.19]It's called Logic.
[12:11.19]And it's based on... It's like a math problem with words.
[12:17.90]I loved it.
[12:18.48]No, not Logitech.
[12:24.43]That's just philosophy.
[12:26.68]No, but it's like a math problem version of like... Just look it up.
[12:32.08]Just look up like logic class or logic math.
[12:35.13]You'll see.
[12:36.07]It's really interesting.
[12:37.11]Please take it if you have an opportunity.
[12:38.35]It'll open your mind if it will.
[12:41.47]I heckin' love Logitech.
[12:45.09]Why did I just read that?
[12:46.03]Because I thought... Whatever.
[12:47.41]I actually... Besides... I'm not gonna... Don't say anything.
[12:54.66]I...
[12:56.64]Shut up, everybody.
[12:57.54]Quiet.
[12:59.22]Actually, that company makes some pretty good stuff.
[13:01.16]I've used it before.
[13:03.16]Except their webcams I have a problem with.
[13:05.56]But that's it.
[13:06.20]I only have a problem with their webcams.
[13:08.10]That's it.
[13:10.78]Just everybody relax.
[13:15.47]That's programming?
[13:17.39]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[13:18.25]Hold on, let me get an example.
[13:19.95]Like a logic example.
[13:21.67]Logic class example.
[13:25.19]We're learning today.
[13:30.17]Crash course in formal logic.
[13:32.39]Logic 101.
[13:33.07]Introduction.
[13:34.71]Introduction to logic.
[13:35.52]Yeah, just fucking go learn.
[13:36.86]I don't... Just turn the stream off right now.
[13:39.16]I'm not doing it.
[13:40.56]Just go learn yourself.
[13:41.34]It's interesting.
[13:42.84]It's like if, this, then for, then why.
[13:45.64]It's like a programming math language problem.
[13:49.47]Just go read.
[13:50.41]Go fucking learn.
[13:51.91]Don't come here.
[13:52.39]I'm playing a dog game.
[13:53.39]You shouldn't even be here right now.
[13:54.37]You should be in fucking school.
[13:55.47]What time is it?
[13:57.69]You should be studying for tomorrow's exam.
[14:05.95]My name is... I don't know.
[14:14.52]I don't even like using my name.
[14:17.84]I'm 36, dude.
[14:18.46]I don't have exams.
[14:21.42]Yeah, but just trust me.
[14:22.52]Take a logic class.
[14:23.30]I know people will be like, oh my god, logic, bad chest, Andy, whatever.
[14:27.50]It's cool.
[14:28.96]How about Mato?
[14:31.94]Alright, so how does this game work?
[14:35.78]Welcome to Wobbledogs.
[14:36.56]This is a sandbox game where you can raise your own little hive of mutated pups.
[14:48.26]Let's go over a few basic concepts before we turn you loose.
[14:51.46]Let's go ahead and get you with a dog to play with.
[14:53.08]I'm gonna move the can.
[14:57.23]My dog's name is Mingle.

[15:05.29]dog buddy stub do we need to no we gotta come on bandit congratulations on your new pup now that you have got a dog let's learn about the dog storage screen it gives you an overview of all the dogs you own and lets you choose which ones are in the world at any given time if a dog ever accidentally ends up being removed from the world this is where it'll end up okay so I have like a dog storage
[15:36.17]How come there's no auto emote?
[15:37.17]I think there is.
[15:40.01]If being born is hungry work, build a food dispenser and use it to feed your new pup.
[15:45.13]Classic food dispenser.
[15:46.33]Alright.
[15:49.15]Build.
[15:55.25]You guys are going to love this game.
[15:56.25]I already know it.
[15:56.73]Okay, so this is... You got to go to the fence.
[16:01.19]Feed your dogs a healthy treat.
[16:03.78]Where should I put it?
[16:07.03]Are we in the corner here?
[16:07.67]Does this cost money?
[16:09.33]Or is it just free?
[16:12.37]Your dog will try to feed itself, but if you click on a piece of food, you can command your dog to eat it.
[16:18.31]You can also grab things to drag them around.
[16:19.79]Use the scroll wheel or hold control to drag them vertically.
[16:21.89]Okay.
[16:25.73]Feed your dog.
[16:29.32]This is like The Sims.
[16:32.98]Get over there.
[16:36.58]Nutritional pellet?
[16:37.63]A burrito?
[16:38.71]French fries?
[16:39.57]What?
[16:40.73]Dogs love to munch on this nutritious pellet.
[16:42.97]Looks like someone's already taken a bite.
[16:44.99]Wait.
[16:48.89]You get it?
[16:50.53]Press the button.
[16:56.55]Dogs are eating burritos.
[16:57.61]It looks like your pup's ready to pupate.
[17:01.74]Press the pupate?
[17:03.88]Also, if you haven't figured it out yet, you have to move the camera, huh?
[17:08.18]Help your dog pupate.
[17:10.64]How do I get rid of this?
[17:11.38]Oh, I gotta get rid of this.
[17:13.18]Uh, are you alright?
[17:18.10]What happened?
[17:20.74]What is going on?
[17:21.77]Why does he have a burrito in his mouth?
[17:23.79]I had two burritos?
[17:29.53]Okay, how do I pupate?
[17:33.19]Got Flora Field Guide?
[17:37.14]What the fuck?
[17:38.88]Standard flora found in nearly all dog-based life forms.
[17:43.87]Beneficial flora often used to help acclimate dogs to cold weather climates.
[17:50.59]Oh, I get this from eating a burrito?
[17:54.48]Alright, enough.
[17:59.18]This dog is fucked up.
[18:00.96]Okay, how do I pupate?
[18:02.82]Help your dog pupate.
[18:05.06]Okay, pupate.
[18:08.56]What?
[18:18.09]This is weird.
[18:20.01]Patch.
[18:22.39]Oh, not on the furry.
[18:23.19]Don't eat those.
[18:26.21]Ugh.
[18:28.27]This is, like, kind of gross.
[18:31.77]Okay.
[18:32.82]Mutations.
[18:34.56]Back leg stance width.
[18:38.80]Body girth went up and nose and ear gloss went up a lot.
[18:47.09]Alright.
[18:50.59]Dogs pupate several times throughout their lives.
[18:52.79]The foods they eat will influence their mutations.
[18:56.43]Let's have you build an incubator.
[18:59.10]You hatch fertilized dog eggs.
[19:00.94]Don't eat that!
[19:01.64]Something's wrong.
[19:05.92]He's freaking out.
[19:09.22]Okay, Incubator.
[19:11.27]He like ate his casing and is losing his mind.
[19:13.95]Okay, Incubator.
[19:19.15]What's over here?
[19:23.98]Even though you don't own any fertilized dog eggs, the Incubator always lets you hatch a dog with default genetics.
[19:30.34]How do I clean shit up here?
[19:33.46]Oh, there we go.
[19:36.23]This thing, this burrito, is this burrito like dirty?
[19:40.17]Okay, let's have a fertilized egg.
[19:45.23]What is going on here?
[19:45.99]Oh, this is Bandit's gut.
[19:50.49]This is weird.
[19:51.05]Okay.
[19:54.05]I'll hatch this egg.
[19:54.81]There's another dog.
[19:56.75]I like mud.
[19:57.35]Mud's great already.
[19:59.01]If you're holding an object, you can press the delete key on your keyboard to destroy it.
[20:01.97]Thank you.
[20:03.17]This works on dogs too, but don't worry, they'll be okay.
[20:06.38]Last up, don't forget to save often.
[20:07.52]The game only autosaves when you travel to breeding mode.
[20:09.98]It's a breeding mode.
[20:11.68]Okay.
[20:16.05]Play around and have fun.
[20:17.75]God.
[20:17.99]Okay.
[20:21.25]So, let's, um, let's have, let's... You want a burrito?

[21:16.29]Are you gonna eat the french fry?
[21:23.21]Okay.
[21:24.29]So that changed your gut flora.
[21:26.53]What's wrong?
[21:30.09]Oh, let's, um... Good dog.
[21:35.13]Click mud, then eat french fry.
[21:36.35]I don't think they really need it.
[21:37.15]Alright, what about, uh, what is this?
[21:41.27]Concurrences.
[21:42.05]A floor found in cocoon drippings.
[21:43.77]So what does this do?
[21:46.35]I don't know.
[21:46.69]It doesn't... I don't know yet.
[21:52.40]But it turns dogs into, like, french fries?
[21:53.80]Okay.
[21:57.00]Default collaboration.
[21:57.84]This is, like, unlocks a ton of shit.
[21:59.18]This, like, kind of seems ridiculous.
[22:00.22]Alright.
[22:01.24]Oh.
[22:01.44]Should I get more dogs?
[22:08.04]Alright, you come over here.
[22:11.30]Okay, I thought someone's gonna eat it.
[22:12.46]I was like, someone's gonna eat that immediately.
[22:13.66]I don't know, that freaked me out.
[22:16.52]What do I do with this?
[22:19.24]It is edible, by the way.
[22:20.57]Gross, yeah.
[22:23.67]Ooh, rewards!
[22:26.19]Randy is waiting for you in storage!
[22:29.93]And you can feed with chicken nuggets now.
[22:32.92]Alright, let's go get Randy.
[22:50.62]It's like, I don't know what the fuck that was.
[22:52.54]That's genetic code?
[22:53.60]Oh, release.
[22:55.76]Bring out.
[22:56.20]Okay.
[22:57.78]It's DNA?
[22:58.70]Hey, hey!
[23:00.46]Why is it blood?
[23:02.80]Okay, for a second I thought Bandit was fucking eating mud.
[23:08.70]What does this do?
[23:10.52]Hey!
[23:12.28]Stop that!
[23:13.10]Stop doing that.
[23:13.88]Please, don't do that.
[23:14.95]What was that?
[23:15.59]That was weird.
[23:22.64]Okay, relax.
[23:24.00]Randy, um, sit.
[23:28.23]I'm trying my best to sit.
[23:30.73]Very good.
[23:31.55]Very, very good.
[23:32.53]Good dog.
[23:38.50]So what can I do with the dirt?
[23:39.24]Anybody want a burrito?
[23:40.78]Do you shit on an egg?
[23:44.24]There's a dog egg in here.
[23:47.44]Why is there a... Wait.
[23:58.27]What happened?
[23:59.46]Looks like you found an unfertilized egg.
[24:00.96]You can use the breeding simulation to inject these with dog genes.
[24:07.46]What?
[24:12.48]Just breed any two of your adult dogs and inject the resultant genes into an egg.
[24:16.89]Afterwards, you can hatch this egg and use the incubator.
[24:18.79]Okay.
[24:25.47]Um...
[24:29.78]Okay, so Randy and Bandit.
[24:38.94]Are you sure you'd like to breed the selected dog?
[24:40.96]This will immediately remove an egg from your inventory.
[24:43.54]Um, yeah.
[24:50.69]What?
[24:52.23]Crossbreed or select final dog.
[24:54.13]I don't know.
[24:58.19]I don't get it.
[24:58.59]What do I do?
[25:02.65]Should I select final?
[25:04.71]Just crossbreed them.
[25:07.67]Um, I don't know who's, I don't know who's got, who's, they're all like, look, what do I do?
[25:14.55]Dog A and Dog B. What is happening?
[25:27.14]Whoa.

[25:30.30]You're right.
[25:34.62]Alright, crossbreed you.
[25:37.68]And... One that's really jumping around.
[25:39.94]Holy shit, that... I want this one jumps.
[25:46.65]Okay, we got a final dog here.
[25:51.47]What do we want?
[25:57.23]Who has the most energy?
[25:58.67]Should we not have the dog with the most energy?
[26:01.51]Keep going?
[26:10.67]I want the dog with... Alright, one more and that's it.
[26:17.44]You... You can stand.

[26:31.35]That was pretty sick.
[26:37.41]Can anybody else do anything like that?
[26:42.67]Oh, I think it's going to be you.
[26:49.84]Yep.
[26:51.92]Yep.
[27:01.08]Rune generation complete?
[27:02.54]What the hell is going on in this game?
[27:06.67]That's got like a Mega Man password.
[27:29.44]This is a very elaborate thing going on.
[27:32.38]Hey!

[31:30.31]No, don't pupate yet.
[31:33.59]How come nobody's eating?
[31:34.29]Oh, somebody took a bite out of this one.
[31:40.97]This reminds me of Viva Piñata, but I kind of feel like there's more I can do.
[31:47.79]At least in an immediate sense.

[66:04.33]He's going like this.
[66:07.87]Sitting.
[66:08.51]Looking at me right in front of the cabinet.
[66:11.56]Just like... I don't know how long he's been sitting there, but he's just like... I'm here.
[66:17.20]Bandit's getting old.
[66:21.51]They're not ready to pass on just yet, but they don't have much time left.
[66:25.71]What?
[66:28.37]Oh no!
[66:30.91]Randy's getting older.
[66:32.13]Oh shit!
[66:37.77]We gotta breed, right?
[66:38.43]We gotta breed now.
[66:39.87]I gotta breed right now.
[66:44.85]We gotta breed.
[66:45.35]I have to do it.
[67:02.42]We're gonna, like, our population's gonna decrease.
[67:06.86]I like, okay, I want... I like the eyes.
[67:10.72]Hmm, who's... Very vocal.
[67:17.14]Okay.
[67:17.36]I think this is good.
[67:19.88]Should I keep going?
[67:36.83]It's the giant, it's the rat, yeah.
[67:38.15]Alright, let's get you in here.
[67:44.50]And let's get you in here.
[67:48.22]You're funny.
[67:48.78]You're doing like a funny thing.
[67:58.07]Again?
[67:58.33]I think that's good.
[68:02.33]I don't think there's enough different genetic mutations here that can happen.
[68:08.41]Generate it 50 times.
[68:10.07]What?
[68:10.27]Is that gonna be bad?
[68:13.30]Won't that be bad?
[68:19.66]Keep going.
[68:20.24]Is it a cow?
[68:26.00]What the fuck was that?
[68:27.02]Alright, well we're gonna take the cow.
[68:32.79]And... Somebody else?
[68:35.49]You?
[68:35.79]You?
[68:42.09]Alright, they're pink.
[68:44.11]Again.
[68:54.88]Alright, I don't want to do another one.
[68:55.84]Alright, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.
[69:03.51]No more.
[69:08.23]Alright, we're at 83% stability.
[69:09.67]I don't want to, that's too much.
[69:12.47]Who just made the weird sound?
[69:15.75]Keep going.
[69:18.41]What?
[69:20.59]What's gonna happen?
[69:21.31]I don't know what's gonna happen.
[69:23.30]83% stable?
[69:28.38]This one's huge.
[69:29.24]I think, alright, this one.
[69:34.20]But that one might cause a problem in... More?
[69:36.94]No.
[69:38.66]No.
[69:39.89]No.
[69:40.92]Is he going to cause a problem?
[69:41.72]He's really kind of rambunctious.
[69:42.90]Let's go.
[69:53.31]Alright, now we get to watch this.
[69:57.69]The dev tweeted at you.
[69:59.21]Really?
[69:59.41]Shut up.
[70:01.71]That didn't happen.
[70:02.15]Shut up.
[70:07.40]Nobody tweeted at me.
[70:14.60]I don't see it.
[70:16.74]What the fuck?
[70:21.88]It's not- I didn't see it.
[70:22.68]Alright, we know how this works.
[70:36.95]That's cool though.
[70:41.09]The president is on the phone.
[70:42.83]You should pick it up.
[70:50.69]I just... I don't know why.
[70:52.49]I just see like a... Oh, what's going on in the White House today?
[70:56.77]And there's like a picture of like Joe Biden sitting in a chair like this.
[71:02.27]With his like sunglasses like down here and he's sleeping.
[71:06.00]And my wobble dog stream is like on like a big TV in like the Oval Office.
[71:15.56]Like, oh, your stream is like so boring.
[71:22.46]But why would he be watching?
[71:23.76]Ooh, water.
[71:34.49]Why wouldn't he be?
[71:35.47]I don't know.
[71:43.66]Imagine any, like, big public figure just doing the... This thing.
[71:49.88]Nobody looks good when they're sleeping not in a bed, by the way.
[71:53.57]Everybody looks fucking crazy.
[71:56.47]Why is that?
[71:58.79]There has been, like, pictures I know that have been, like... Everybody has that photo, right?
[72:03.39]Like, oh, mom took it or something.
[72:05.01]Where you're, like, in, like, the car or you're on the couch or something and you're, like...
[72:14.06]Like, what the f- Why do we do- What's going on here?
[72:16.40]Why do we go like... It hurts to do that.
[72:21.58]It's actually hard to do that.
[72:25.66]How come we don't go like... It's always like... Alright, incubate that egg.
[72:36.79]I can't wait to see what happens here.
[72:39.69]We're unknowingly supporting our heads.
[72:42.49]That's weird.
[72:46.77]The body was never meant to fall asleep sitting upright.
[73:00.54]You literally showed a picture of you once when you were sleeping and you looked like beef?
[73:04.74]Beef and cheese?
[73:05.96]What the fuck are you talking about?
[73:09.84]Alright, we need a name.
[73:18.07]Spam.
[73:20.81]Ew.
[73:20.99]Ugh.
[73:21.39]Alright.
[73:23.87]Welcome to the world, Spam.
[73:28.90]How are you?
[73:29.30]You're going to get a steady diet of coconuts and bananas.
[73:37.20]You must be very hungry.
[73:38.76]Go relax.
[73:44.47]How's everybody doing?
[73:45.65]Alright.
[73:46.09]Mud, you need to... Aren't they close to...
[73:49.54]I need to breed again, but I don't need to.
[73:51.76]Not yet.
[73:53.22]Well, you're gonna die much faster if you keep doing that.
[73:55.74]Alright, mud.
[74:04.38]Should I breed again?
[74:10.74]I don't think I want to.
[74:15.12]You can recycle plastic bottles by giving them to a dog?
[74:19.46]What if you eat this?
[74:20.44]I don't know, but you probably shouldn't eat plastic.
[74:24.93]What happens if I grab it?
[74:26.81]Throw it.
[74:29.01]That was a good try.
[74:30.45]That was a good try.
[74:31.13]Try it again.
[74:32.75]Throw it.
[74:35.31]Come on, you can do it.
[74:37.24]Come on.
[74:39.38]Get over there and do it.
[74:40.48]Throw it.
[74:44.62]Come on.
[74:47.18]You can do it.
[74:53.28]That was so good.
[74:56.10]You threw that.
[74:57.04]That was so good.
[74:57.88]Okay, now destroy that.
[75:06.99]Your dogs can't walk.
[75:08.81]It's a baby.
[75:09.77]It just came out.
[75:12.23]What do you mean?
[75:16.67]This is the weirdest one.
[75:18.17]I can't wait to breed this one.
[75:23.85]He's a baby.
[75:24.31]Yeah, the baby.
[75:27.93]Oh, sorry.
[75:28.25]The baby doesn't know how to walk.
[75:33.69]What are you doing?
[75:36.79]I want to feed a very good diet of bananas and coconuts.
[75:42.31]I don't want you eating chicken nuggets or anything.
[75:47.47]I want you eating good, nutritious fruits.
[75:52.01]And it has lived a long, full life and is now time for them to pass on.
[76:02.70]Oh no, Randy!
[76:10.78]Oh!
[76:12.97]Oh my god, what?! !
[76:18.29]No, don't eat him.
[76:19.75]He's gonna go eat his body.
[76:21.87]No, he's the weird one.
[76:23.43]He's the weird one.
[76:26.27]Don't, you're not gonna eat that, right?
[76:27.75]How do I, what do I, dog head?
[76:28.97]Oh!
[76:33.77]Should I, I don't know what I should do.
[76:35.00]Should I, is this extra DNA points?
[76:40.32]Oh my god.
[76:41.80]Do I get DNA or something?
[76:43.38]Is this, I don't know, is it worth doing this?
[76:49.56]I might get like DNA points.
[76:51.32]I don't know.
[76:51.76]Alright, I'm just testing this.
[76:54.56]I don't like this, but this might actually unlock something.
[77:10.17]It does.
[77:17.08]Ugh.
[77:17.84]Okay, don't eat every- okay, this is fucked up.
[77:22.84]High quality dog core?
[77:25.73]What is that?
[77:27.01]High quality dog core.
[77:29.73]Mysterious orb.
[77:30.61]Can I open it?
[77:39.29]Cracked open.
[77:42.05]What is that?
[77:44.70]Somebody- should you eat this?
[77:55.24]Alright, you don't look at this.
[77:56.36]I don't want you to see this.
[77:57.94]You just stay over here and eat the coconuts.
[78:03.30]Lifespan extended.
[78:06.54]Oh, look at that.
[78:07.05]Okay.
[78:07.15]Alright, you need to go to bed.
[78:10.13]Alright, you guys go to sleep.
[78:18.93]Eat this coconut.
[78:20.29]It's nutritious.
[78:20.87]Don't eat other dogs, please.
[78:25.91]Are you ready?
[78:26.47]Okay.
[78:27.09]Pupate.
[78:29.58]They're both ready to pupate.
[78:37.72]You want to eat that first?
[78:41.69]Eat that first, because I want you to get more mutations.
[78:50.65]I mean, whatever you did, that was fucking cool.
[78:56.84]Alright, you know what?
[78:57.38]Go for it.
[78:57.90]Pupate.
[79:00.70]Where's, um... We'll figure that out later.
[79:13.01]Alright, what do we got?
[79:24.12]You just ate something weird.
[79:25.22]Now you're...
[79:28.16]Okay.
[79:31.08]It's adult.
[79:33.35]Back legs, front legs.
[79:35.03]He's pretty big now.
[79:37.65]Front bottom leg length.
[79:41.29]I feel like the proportions are kind of wrong.
[79:52.88]Interesting.
[79:53.80]What happened to you?
[79:55.48]Nothing really.
[79:58.58]Okay, you got a little wider.
[80:00.62]Okay.
[80:05.54]Very interesting.
[80:06.30]Very interesting.
[80:09.57]Can't walk now?
[80:11.79]Yeah, he'll be fine.
[80:16.63]He's fine.
[80:22.17]There we go.
[80:22.87]Oh god, you actually can't walk.
[80:27.85]You need to go to bed.
[80:37.17]Okay, you're fine.
[80:40.86]You can walk.
[80:43.94]They do need to go to sleep though.
[80:44.86]Alright, let's clean up a little bit.
[80:45.72]This is kind of a mess.
[80:55.66]Mess.
[81:02.25]Okay, I got a lot of things to unlock.
[81:03.69]Clean up 10 poops.
[81:05.88]A ham slider.

[81:32.83]And then connect this.
[81:35.99]Oh, shit.
[81:36.67]I can't do that.
[81:38.19]Um... Move this.
[81:39.68]Alright, this is where they're gonna... The feeding will be here.
[81:45.66]I don't think they can connect like that.
[81:48.36]Oh, they can?
[81:49.14]Can I do that?
[81:55.01]Starting room?
[81:55.99]Oh, starting wall.

[82:23.05]That works, right?
[82:30.83]How'd they get up there?
[82:32.76]Can they get up there?
[82:36.77]I'm not sure they can go that way.
[82:51.54]Oh, there we go.
[82:52.14]Alright, now how do I... This is fucked up.
[82:54.94]How do I remove this one?

[83:07.26]So this is going to be the feeding room.
[83:15.12]What should I do?
[83:17.03]Food.
[83:17.39]Let's do like a food room.
[83:19.07]Actually, this kind of reminds me of Chuck E. Cheese.
[83:20.37]Let's do that.
[83:22.47]Check the Twitter.
[83:23.01]Alright, I'm checking Twitter.
[83:23.77]Hold on.

[83:55.38]Aren't I doing that?
[83:57.12]I'm breeding.
[83:59.44]Please breed your dogs.

[84:06.13]Okay.
[84:06.57]Well, that's cool.

[84:42.84]It was Trump.
[84:55.05]Alright, this is the food room.
[85:02.50]All dogs will come up here to the cafeteria station.
[85:08.48]This is where they will be enjoying their meals.
[85:13.40]This is going to be huge.
[85:14.12]This is an ugly room.
[85:20.99]Alright.
[85:21.57]Food.
[85:21.85]There should be something to eat on.
[85:26.91]Oh, no.

[85:48.89]If they're hungry, they come up here.
[85:50.35]They just got a lot of food.
[85:51.25]They can just eat on the ground.
[85:52.79]It's gonna mutate the fuck out of them, though.
[85:54.21]But who cares?
[85:58.24]Whoever's hungry...
[86:02.21]Okay, I need to hatch you now.
[86:03.97]Let's go.

[86:59.98]What's up, G4?
[87:02.22]I appreciate it.
[87:02.72]Thanks a lot.
[87:06.02]I'll take this one to zero.
[87:11.28]Let's do two little ones.
[87:18.01]G4 would like an encore.
[87:20.47]This one's kind of weird.
[87:21.75]How long should I do this for, though?
[87:28.62]These two.
[87:28.94]They're really like thin, skinny ones.
[87:32.48]Do it until zero?

[88:24.84]One more?
[88:27.24]Take the long one?
[88:31.84]Alright, one more time.
[88:38.23]Okay, this one, look at this one.

[91:35.91]This one can't really walk.
[91:39.63]This one takes a very long time to get anywhere.

[93:45.30]Is there a way I can lift this up, like, vertically?
[93:49.62]I know there's a way.
[93:50.74]There it is.
[93:55.29]Everyone start eating food, please.

[95:27.84]Why are they all wet?
[95:28.64]I don't understand.
[95:33.14]Why are they wet?
[95:35.50]They're all wet.
[95:43.99]There's no AC.
[95:46.43]He doesn't like it.
[95:46.87]He threw up.
[95:47.95]What?
[95:53.31]Who's even alive?

[95:57.26]Let me get you a... Alright, I got... Hold on.
[95:59.42]Hatcho mutated dog with more than four legs.
[96:01.74]Honeycomb.
[96:02.30]Ooh.
[96:03.16]Alright.
[96:07.56]Hopefully you mutated into something.
[96:10.87]Oh, you got... It's huge.
[96:12.71]Huge...
[96:15.08]And what else?
[96:19.94]34%.
[96:23.60]Doesn't care for food, lazy, and is rude.
[96:29.26]Can this dog even fit in the house?
[96:39.77]Alright, yeah, get some sleep.
[96:47.36]Okay, who else?
[96:48.92]You guys are doing fine over here.
[96:53.03]Alright, do I do more breeding?
[96:54.55]I'm gonna have to breed these two again.
[97:03.63]And this time we'll go, we'll do, we'll take them to zero.
[97:08.33]Ooh, okay.
[97:11.03]They sound like snakes.
[97:21.60]How about, uh... Yeah, let's do it.
[97:27.13]You should import somebody else's dog.
[97:28.99]Well, hold on now.
[97:30.47]Not quite.
[97:38.38]Salmon?
[97:43.40]Okay, what does the stability actually mean?
[97:45.28]Can somebody help me out with that?
[97:47.70]What does that realistically mean?
[97:57.05]Less stability equals more mutations.
[97:59.07]Oh, okay.
[97:59.97]That's how crazy it is.
[98:07.27]Oh, we got an orange.
[98:11.07]Orange dog.
[98:21.52]Alright, we're gonna get an orange.
[98:23.46]It's huge.
[98:30.60]Alright, we're getting weird.
[98:33.86]Again?
[98:40.37]What happened?
[98:41.97]We lost some along the way here.
[98:51.86]Alright, they don't look that bad.
[99:05.44]They still look actually perfectly fine.
[99:07.32]How about these two?
[99:14.08]34% stability, but they look alright.
[99:21.15]Alright, maybe one more.
[99:24.43]Alright.
[99:33.72]Look at this one.
[99:35.18]Orange and green and looks very strong.
[99:39.91]Keep doing it.
[99:42.33]Go to zero.
[99:49.61]Again?
[99:53.26]Again?
[100:02.17]Alright, we're at zero.
[100:03.73]We're good!
[100:24.66]Oh yeah.
[100:30.74]I got an achievement for that.
[100:40.75]You get the perfect dog.
[100:41.71]Okay.
[100:46.13]I think I'm getting some cool stuff here.
[100:51.69]Okay, get a litter in the... Get a tiny litter in the breeding simulation.
[100:55.47]Okay, an egg.
[100:57.20]And then what do I get for this?
[100:59.06]Simulated floor.
[101:00.20]Cool.
[101:02.98]Alright, let's get that egg in there.
[101:13.00]Alright, spam is... I don't think I want to breed spam.
[101:17.42]I think we just let spam die.
[101:19.12]Because... You know what I mean?
[101:22.88]It's not... It's not looking great.
[101:34.83]Sad.
[101:36.77]What the fuck?
[101:37.59]Oh, this is the playroom, right.
[101:38.81]You're gonna have fun in the playroom?
[101:43.35]Yeah, go, like, play with this.
[101:44.63]Go, like, bite that.
[101:45.23]Here we go.
[101:51.61]Alright, how about, um... Creamsicle.
[102:05.20]Butter.
[102:14.67]Butter.
[102:15.71]No.
[102:16.83]Um.
[102:18.40]Carrot.
[102:18.84]No.
[102:20.78]Cheese brick.
[102:24.52]Butterscotch.
[102:31.00]Sherbert.
[102:34.53]Sherbert.
[102:38.49]Alright, Sherbert.
[102:39.07]I want to feed you really weird shit, so I want you to come back.
[102:41.73]Are you able to walk?
[102:45.64]How are you doing?
[102:47.48]Some dogs eat to live.
[102:49.10]This one lives to eat.
[102:50.88]Not very interested in other dogs.
[102:53.96]And lazy.
[102:56.50]Why are they all so lazy?
[102:57.88]Look, they can't even do anything.
[102:59.42]It takes them so long.
[103:02.42]Alright, what do I want to feed you?
[103:05.13]Something.
[103:07.25]Oh, mud.
[103:07.77]How are you doing?
[103:09.11]You want some food, mud?
[103:11.31]Um, how about a ham slider?
[103:12.61]Let's try that one.
[103:14.49]Good to go.
[103:17.96]Try this.
[103:23.62]You like ham?
[103:25.22]You do?
[103:25.50]Alright, good.
[103:25.99]Alright, I want something weird here.
[103:34.11]Alien fruit.
[103:37.36]And I'm going to feed that to the guy we just came up with.
[103:42.74]What the fuck?
[103:52.01]Get in there.
[103:57.93]Where's the fruit?
[104:00.92]What happened?
[104:11.23]Climb.
[104:13.77]This takes a while here.
[104:15.01]Come on.
[104:15.29]Alright, where did the fruit go?
[104:21.87]Where did that alien from?
[104:23.24]I don't understand.
[104:23.90]It's just gone.
[104:26.14]It just doesn't exist.
[104:33.04]Alright, give that a try.
[104:38.29]What did you get?
[104:40.15]Coconuts?
[104:43.81]Oh, Spam actually likes coconuts.
[104:45.43]That's insane.
[104:47.37]Spam hates food.
[104:48.29]Okay, Spam likes coconuts.
[104:52.66]It's very important to remember.
[104:53.60]I don't have any den upgrades.
[105:04.55]Eat this, like, tooth, too.
[105:13.00]Alright, raw.
[105:13.56]What do we got?
[105:19.60]Alright.
[105:20.68]Got a little more green.
[105:25.21]Legs got bigger.
[105:25.95]Legs got... Actually, this might actually help a lot.
[105:33.21]Do you want to eat, like, a tooth or something here?
[105:40.03]Like, eat this stuff.
[105:46.97]They're also slow.
[105:47.99]They all can't even move.
[105:53.20]The hell?
[105:53.56]Look at how- Okay, this is the only one that actually walks.
[105:57.57]Go eat a banana.
[106:02.17]Cool.
[106:02.91]How you doing?
[106:05.61]Very nice.
[106:07.26]Probably need some sleep.
[106:07.84]Go eat some more ham.
[106:08.44]Okay.
[106:15.06]Eat whatever- I don't want to do that.
[106:18.97]Alright, well don't.
[106:24.50]Does this cost money because spam just keeps eating coconuts?
[106:27.97]Over and over again.
[106:32.13]Go eat this, like, moon cheese thing.
[106:34.05]I want to see some mutations, please.
[106:53.09]Alright, Ra's asleep.
[106:55.41]Can I- can any- can I breed anybody?
[107:00.31]Um... Let's go to bed!
[107:02.70]I can, but I don't want to yet.
[107:07.42]Everyone's tired.
[107:23.12]Iron fence.
[107:24.58]Fence.
[107:30.66]The good thing is nobody's like, kind of, nobody's, everyone's pretty happy.
[107:33.24]There's still a few that I haven't found yet.
[107:43.18]A lot, actually.
[107:43.72]Stop destroying the dirt?
[107:46.98]What does the dirt do?
[107:48.80]Why?
[107:49.02]You have to name somebody Macho.
[107:53.84]That's a good idea.
[107:57.82]Put the dirt clumps in the dirt patch.
[108:06.74]What's that stick bug meme?
[108:15.27]Foam cylinder.
[108:17.07]What are you doing?
[108:18.61]Get out of here!
[108:21.85]What the fuck are you doing?
[108:26.65]Stop doing that.
[108:28.31]Don't do that.
[108:29.59]You just woke up your brother.
[108:30.69]Okay, fine.
[108:33.29]Alright, roll over.
[108:39.15]No, you didn't.
[108:44.66]Roll over.
[108:45.18]See, I did it.
[108:51.84]Good job.
[108:58.43]Ooh, an egg.
[108:58.83]Does anybody know any tricks?
[109:09.88]Can you do rollover?
[109:11.52]Wow, you can do it.
[109:12.62]Mudd's smart.
[109:17.16]Alright, Mudd.
[109:17.64]Um, you need to go to bed.
[109:22.22]Do you know anything?
[109:27.47]Can you do rollover?
[109:29.55]You can, wow.
[109:30.37]Actually, they're pretty smart.
[109:31.27]Alright, you need to go in here now.
[109:40.11]Just go sleep somewhere.
[109:40.91]Sleep right here.
[109:44.35]Stay away from the incubator.
[109:45.32]That's not for dogs.
[109:47.52]Alright, you want to eat.
[109:52.42]You need to mutate too.
[109:53.28]Okay.
[109:55.56]Eat this like weird cheese.
[110:00.13]Feed somebody a cocoon.
[110:06.88]I can't wait to breed this.
[110:08.20]Sir, hello.
[110:13.12]I'm writing an article for my school paper.
[110:14.48]Would you like to give an explanation for the events that occurred three days ago during the strawberry magic stream?
[110:19.44]What do you want to know?
[110:20.12]Okay, good.
[110:23.52]Sleep for you.
[110:27.38]Where's this?
[110:29.01]No, not yet.
[110:39.34]And... Alright, what happened?
[110:47.27]Not much.
[110:48.05]Just kind of grew up a little bit.
[110:48.95]Alright, so somebody said don't fuck with the dirt, right?
[110:59.70]Just leave the dirt.
[111:03.94]Where did you find this?
[111:05.26]This was recommended a bunch of times.
[111:08.22]It's been on the list for a little while.
[111:11.00]I think it's cute.
[111:11.48]I think this is fun.
[111:12.04]Alright, Spam needs to eat.
[111:17.70]Uh... What should I feed you?
[111:20.32]I got something new.
[111:21.01]Yeah, Honeycomb.
[111:23.95]Try this.
[111:24.25]See if you like it.
[111:30.07]You like it?
[111:34.99]Well...
[111:36.87]You guys both apparently like that.
[111:38.41]So let's just put another one over here.
[111:40.39]Try it again.
[111:42.59]You look more like a sheep than a dog.
[111:44.19]Okay.
[111:49.07]Anybody else hungry?
[111:51.83]Square area.
[111:53.52]Who is this?
[111:56.34]Go in there and go to sleep.
[111:57.56]You need to sleep.
[112:01.98]Alright, where's raw?
[112:02.52]Okay, raw.
[112:03.24]Raw, eat a honeycomb.
[112:04.24]I feel like that would, like, fuck you up.
[112:05.96]Like, your DNA or whatever.
[112:11.36]It's very nutritious, but I feel like it's gonna, like, fuck up the DNA stuff.
[112:14.32]It's gonna be interesting.
[112:17.32]Sheep.
[112:19.82]Alright, now go to sleep.
[112:20.38]Okay.
[112:26.47]What do we get?
[112:30.33]Berry bros.
[112:38.60]Ooh.
[112:44.41]Just got bigger.
[112:46.13]Body got glossy.
[112:49.83]I think I can breed now.
[112:52.91]Can I?
[112:55.43]No, not yet.
[112:55.95]Alright, eat another honeycomb.
[113:08.00]Eat that.
[113:13.97]And then go in the corner and sleep.
[113:15.23]Who else should eat this?
[113:18.53]Okay, mud come out here and eat this.
[113:22.06]I feel like the honeycomb is going to do really cool stuff.
[113:28.56]Spam can breed.
[113:29.40]They're not on the list, are they?
[113:31.66]Oh, we can, can they?
[113:34.54]Not old enough.
[113:36.20]See?
[113:38.21]Not old enough.
[113:44.50]Uh, mud.
[113:46.40]Eat this.
[113:51.22]Light, loud, and aloof.
[113:53.10]That's fine.
[113:53.44]What are you doing?
[113:58.05]You okay?
[114:02.73]Um... How come this... Why are they sweaty sometimes?
[114:20.35]dehydrated tree let's see what this does eat this you like it good where is everybody
[114:47.26]You're over there.
[114:47.66]You need to eat something too.
[114:51.73]Should I landscape?
[114:52.77]This is kind of getting out of hand.
[114:58.47]Eat the dirt.
[115:01.94]Oh, should we?
[115:02.40]No.
[115:03.22]Let's only give spam.
[115:05.98]What are you doing?
[115:11.50]How about a cut fruit?
[115:15.29]I want a lot of different options.
[115:17.49]Genetics-wise.
[115:18.03]Alright, try that.
[115:34.37]You don't like it?
[115:34.93]Defense tool option has something for removing plants.
[115:39.29]Okay.
[115:40.27]Oh, you like it.
[115:40.69]It's fine.
[115:49.11]I guess I'm going to do flooring.
[115:50.61]Oh, this thing.
[115:53.82]Put it in the playroom.
[116:04.40]That's kind of huge, but whatever.
[116:05.50]Everyone want to check it out?
[116:15.68]Alright, you ready to go?
[116:17.10]Go for it.
[116:22.03]Green shag.
[116:23.07]I think now we can breed.
[116:33.05]I think.
[116:33.31]Wanna go try it out?
[116:43.28]Check out the roller.
[116:43.86]Come on, play it.
[116:45.56]I just bought it.
[116:46.06]Come on.
[116:50.98]Play with it.
[116:55.04]Play with it.
[117:00.35]They don't even want to play with it.
[117:07.95]Save the game.
[117:08.41]Yep.
[117:08.59]Good call.
[117:14.09]How are you supposed to play with a big tube?
[117:15.37]I don't know, like, you get your- you put your arms up, and you put your whole body flush with it, and then you put your face down, you grip with your hands, and you put your entire- you kind of mold around it, and then push forward, and like, roll, roll, roll, roll!
[117:34.06]But you get on top of it, and you do like the- like the run thing, like a big log.
[117:43.26]Oh, no.
[117:43.88]Are you okay?
[117:45.78]Oh, I don't think you'd like this.
[117:46.76]Are you having fun?
[117:50.55]What the fuck?
[117:57.79]I don't think Sherbert's having fun doing this.
[118:00.69]Are you?
[118:00.99]Fight it.
[118:07.44]Here, have a banana.
[118:11.90]Have a banana.
[118:21.72]You don't do CBD on stream anymore?
[118:24.44]No, not really.
[118:24.94]Okay, what do you got?
[118:31.18]Longer legs.
[118:35.61]You should.
[118:37.11]No, I shouldn't.
[118:41.67]I told you, when I was playing Saw 2...
[118:45.99]I could not read an analog clock, and I realized I can't really take THC and stream.
[118:55.31]I walked in a circle for like an hour.
[119:02.27]It was a long time.
[119:03.11]Ooh, a caterpillar.
[119:08.24]I gotta pee.
[119:11.84]I'll be right back.
[119:13.66]Break time.

[124:46.12]I wanted to refill my drink too.
[124:51.50]It's hot.
[124:55.32]The crazy thing about Vegas, Vegas goes from it being 50 degrees outside to 100 in three days.
[125:10.77]It's kind of insane.
[125:17.00]Let me... Camera, hold on.

[130:21.97]Where are you taking it?
[130:25.86]Oh, I think he's taking it away from everybody.
[130:29.56]Because he wants to eat in private.

[131:20.60]Okay.
[131:26.40]No, you should eat it.
[131:27.34]Eat it, because you're hungry.
[131:31.50]Oh, ready for a mutation.
[131:39.45]Sherbert takes a long time to level up here.
[131:41.45]Alright, what do we got?

[131:48.98]I think you got smaller.
[131:52.98]Yeah.

[132:10.98]He's becoming human.
[132:17.39]Oh, Jesus.
[132:21.31]Even bigger.

[138:16.80]Don't eat that shit.
[138:18.00]Stop eating poop.
[138:21.89]Don't eat poop.
[138:22.85]Don't eat poop.

[139:39.28]Defying all odds, Mud is still alive.
[139:42.22]Interesting.
[139:45.14]You seriously can't go that far?
[139:47.18]Oh my goodness.
[139:49.88]There you go.

[141:29.35]Oh, be careful mud.
[141:30.35]You're so close to being like dead.
[141:33.23]That's not, that's so scary.
[141:34.99]I don't like when you do that.
[141:36.51]What do you want?
[141:38.28]You want something?
[141:38.72]Why don't you two like play?
[142:11.46]This actually hurts.
[142:14.72]Oh, no!
[142:15.18]Why do they have to do that?

[145:52.85]Okay, I wanna get, I don't, I wanna get rid of this stuff.
[145:55.55]I don't want people eating this shit.
[146:01.25]You okay?
[146:01.73]What's wrong?
[146:03.85]You alright?
[146:05.43]What's the matter?
[146:05.83]Alright, who is this?
[146:20.40]Oh, this was, uh, this was raw.
[146:26.19]Body color is going orange here.
[146:28.15]Back top leg length.
[146:31.24]Uh oh.
[146:32.56]That's a lot.
[146:39.44]It's actually going to be hard to walk around, I think.
[146:49.80]Green bamboo wall.
[146:51.01]Cool.
[146:53.74]Alright, we got eggs now.
[146:54.80]Who else?
[146:55.10]You're up there.
[146:55.66]Spud's up there.
[146:59.52]I think I can incubate the other one, right?
[147:02.32]Yes, I can.
[147:09.50]Alright, Spud.
[147:10.20]What'd you get?
[147:13.17]Not a whole lot.
[147:20.33]Eat the cocoon.
[147:25.42]Anybody hungry?
[147:25.92]Sherbert can mutate.
[147:29.26]Alright.
[147:30.74]Loves to eat.
[147:31.34]Should I... Let's just get you going.
[147:36.44]Spud didn't really eat that much.
[147:42.36]Spud's never hungry.
[147:43.28]Honestly, I don't think Spud really eats that much.
[147:57.47]At the cocoon?
[147:58.07]Yeah, I am.
[147:58.41]I thought that was a french fry on the ground.
[148:01.41]Okay.
[148:11.80]Herbert is getting a little bigger.
[148:18.52]Getting a little glossier.
[148:23.78]Okay, memorial.
[148:24.68]Spooky food dispenser.
[148:26.08]Ooh, we got new food.
[148:27.06]Alright, what is it?
[148:28.86]Let's check it out.
[148:30.46]Alright, I need to... Let me clean this up.
[148:33.78]Right?
[148:34.06]Like, I don't want to... This is more... I don't like this.
[148:36.10]This is morbid.
[148:36.56]Okay, a new food dispenser.
[148:49.64]Oops, okay.
[148:51.60]Spooky food dispenser.
[148:52.96]I could probably change some decorations up too.
[149:05.68]Um, let me move this.
[149:06.80]There's already one of these down there.
[149:08.78]Let's get rid of it.
[149:13.10]I'm very curious about this though.
[149:15.50]Alright, so what can I do with this?
[149:17.06]Let me redecorate it.
[149:23.70]I like this better.
[149:28.42]I like the hot dogs.
[149:31.88]Oh, down in the playroom.
[149:39.20]This thing's kind of annoying.
[149:44.10]Okay.
[149:47.96]This is a fun little thing.
[149:55.77]Car is... I don't know if I like this button, whatever.
[149:58.25]It's variety.
[150:04.59]It's variety.
[150:05.11]Oh, I won't put the fan over here.
[150:17.22]Pull people off.
[150:18.10]How about like, um... You can listen to music, listen to tunes, and cool off a little.
[150:25.03]And then maybe like a fun little speaker over here or something.
[150:32.62]Yeah, it's like a nice cooling fan.
[150:37.60]Ugh.
[150:42.33]Alright, there is... What about, um... Bubblegum.
[150:53.76]Gumby.
[150:57.97]I don't like smush.
[151:02.78]Gideon Othnir.
[151:07.60]I like smush.
[151:10.02]Welcome to the world, smush.
[151:14.49]How come all the dogs are lazy?
[151:16.07]Alright, raw needs some food.
[151:22.10]28 minutes old.
[151:23.00]That's funny.
[151:25.49]Alright, go up and eat one of the weird things.
[151:27.57]Where's Raw?
[151:28.13]Where are you?
[151:28.47]There you are.
[151:29.15]Let me see you.
[151:40.44]A gourd?
[151:41.12]Okay, eat a gourd.
[151:43.06]Try this.
[151:45.14]What do you think?
[151:47.58]What does that do?
[151:57.98]Is that a new DNA?
[152:01.34]That's very filling, too.
[152:02.58]Alright, what about, um... What about some decorative corn?
[152:05.26]Try that.
[152:14.01]Loud sleeper, geez.
[152:21.27]What a goal.
[152:24.11]Raise a dog that lives long enough to become ancient.
[152:27.64]Burnt dog biscuit?
[152:29.10]Wait, who's ancient?
[152:32.02]Oh, Squaree!
[152:35.32]Squaree is ancient.
[152:47.53]I'll turn that off.
[152:48.17]I fucking hate that.
[152:53.92]Short body and yellow coloration from eating the gourd.
[152:57.56]Do I have any more eggs?
[153:01.75]Alright, I have... Let me see, can I breed?
[153:08.27]I can, alright.
[153:09.60]Um, nobody else is old enough yet.
[153:22.18]Okay, spam.
[153:23.14]I want you to eat a candy apple.
[153:28.12]Try that.
[153:30.60]You alright?
[153:31.26]You okay?
[153:32.16]I'm sorry.
[153:33.06]I did not mean to do that.
[153:34.22]Don't bite me.
[153:44.07]Eat the candy apple and the decorative corn.
[153:47.95]Look at that new DNA.
[153:51.31]New DNA.
[153:56.06]Okay, I don't think you liked it, but you got some DNA.
[153:58.28]What about the corn?
[153:58.86]Do you like decorative corn?
[154:11.18]Try the decorative corn.
[154:14.89]No?
[154:17.57]No?
[154:17.77]Are you okay?
[154:22.43]Okay.
[154:25.48]Kind of didn't really like that.
[154:26.64]What is this one?
[154:35.30]Uh, I just, this one here.
[154:36.10]Don't know what the effects are.
[154:41.76]Still don't know the, oh, brown coloration, okay.
[154:43.54]Can I make a centipede?
[154:53.60]Um, okay.
[154:54.32]Who else should, who needs to eat?
[154:56.12]Spud's hungry.
[154:56.84]Oh no, what's wrong with Spud?
[154:57.78]His nose is glowing.
[154:58.57]I'll bring him a candy apple.
[155:19.06]Alright, hey Spud.
[155:22.02]Try this.
[155:27.28]Is it hot in here?
[155:28.00]What's wrong with Smush?
[155:31.88]Are you okay?
[155:33.18]Oh my god, what's wrong with Smush?
[155:38.56]You alright?
[155:40.09]Why are you just in the corner?
[155:40.99]Um... It's me.
[155:48.27]Alright, you're fine.
[155:52.77]Need to feed you something, though.
[156:01.27]Ooh.
[156:03.96]Tech floor.
[156:06.78]Is it really hot in here?
[156:07.60]I'm gonna have a fan going.
[156:08.62]Some of these people need to sleep.
[156:17.14]Alright, I need some more food.
[156:22.88]Let's get some gourds.
[156:27.67]Uh, something like chicken and nutri- yeah, sliders.
[156:32.65]Stop.
[156:33.95]Stop it.
[156:35.15]What's going on over here?
[156:35.93]Stop.
[156:37.19]Hey.
[156:40.57]Who's causing a problem?
[156:41.45]Which one?
[156:43.19]Hey.
[156:44.36]That was not very nice.
[156:45.38]That wasn't very nice.
[156:49.24]Get off of him.
[156:51.34]Get off of him.
[156:51.74]That's not nice, what you're doing.
[156:52.68]Are you okay?
[156:56.24]Raw.
[156:59.70]That wasn't very nice.
[157:02.91]You hungry?
[157:04.55]Let him up.
[157:05.47]Let him up.
[157:07.75]Let him up.
[157:11.51]Stop.
[157:12.03]Why do you have it out for him so bad?
[157:13.55]Let him up.
[157:16.03]Why?
[157:18.35]Stop it.
[157:18.97]Let him up.
[157:20.33]Don't do that.
[157:24.96]Come over here.
[157:30.52]Stop!
[157:31.36]Hey!
[157:33.50]You sit down right now.
[157:35.64]Sit down over here.
[157:37.42]Excuse me.
[157:38.12]No.
[157:39.69]Sit down.
[157:40.87]Leaves Ra alone.
[157:41.97]What did Ra do for no reason?
[157:43.83]You don't bite him for no reason?
[157:48.53]He's still... Alright, Ra.
[157:50.59]Ra, come here.
[157:52.83]Ra, we're gonna put you over here.
[157:53.79]Here, here's a gourd.
[157:57.85]Here.
[157:58.05]Try that.
[158:01.53]No, don't leave.
[158:02.11]Don't leave.
[158:02.45]You idiot.
[158:06.64]You can't just like dominate this space.
[158:08.88]The problem is... Spam is territorially claiming the food room.
[158:15.60]Maybe I shouldn't have a food room.
[158:18.49]It seems like it's causing problems.
[158:19.61]Because he's claiming this is territory.
[158:43.54]Come over here.
[158:44.58]Go in front of the fan.
[158:46.90]Right here.
[158:52.34]Can you not stay there?
[158:53.51]Alright, I'm just going to hold you here because you're like sweating.
[158:55.93]Okay.
[159:01.71]He's sweating.
[159:03.91]Alright, here comes the mean one.
[159:06.38]Are you done?
[159:09.78]Go sleep in the playroom.
[159:12.46]Go sleep in the playroom.
[159:16.08]Come here.
[159:19.18]Eat a banana.
[159:20.10]And then go to sleep in the playroom.
[159:28.10]Okay.
[159:28.63]Now go over here and go to bed.
[159:32.91]He's being bad.
[159:36.95]Now go sleep over there.
[159:37.95]And leave everybody alone.
[159:48.55]Oh, we got a ton of mutations coming.
[159:53.09]Smush.
[159:55.05]Got a green nose now.
[159:55.91]Oh, that's so cute.
[159:58.86]Back leg stance width.
[160:01.14]More of a little width there.
[160:03.30]Okay.
[160:06.52]Very shiny.
[160:09.52]Very nice.
[160:10.20]What about you?
[160:21.78]It's all yellow.
[160:29.80]Interesting.
[160:30.38]Alright.
[160:30.80]It got even longer.
[160:31.60]This is like a banana now.
[160:38.51]What's going on in here?
[160:39.33]Why are they all fighting?
[160:41.77]Stop fighting.
[160:43.51]Smush.
[160:46.56]Stop it.
[160:48.24]Everybody relax.
[160:50.24]Relax.
[160:50.76]You're both very good dogs.
[160:58.79]Alright, you're back.
[160:59.47]You're okay.
[161:04.51]I wonder, can I breed now?
[161:13.12]You don't.
[161:14.62]Alright.
[161:16.24]Raw is kind of scary.
[161:25.67]He's having a good time, so whatever.
[161:26.85]He's rolling around in pee.
[161:43.96]Sherbert hasn't really changed that much.
[161:47.10]We can breed though.
[161:47.70]A little more gloss.
[161:51.92]A little bit bigger.
[161:55.95]Back bottom leg length.
[161:57.57]That's actually going to be concerning.
[162:00.08]His back legs are too long.
[162:06.28]Alright, I think it's time to breed.
[162:08.50]We have a few adults here.
[162:10.18]Yellow, here.
[162:10.92]Okay, spud.
[162:20.19]Front bottom leg length.
[162:24.17]Interesting. 40%.
[162:27.56]Smaller ears.
[162:30.13]Body metallic.
[162:34.19]His front legs are too long.
[162:39.93]Eat 10 clumps of dirt.
[162:41.50]Mud floor.
[162:42.08]Alright, it's time.
[162:46.86]I got an egg here.
[162:47.70]I'm gonna do raw.
[162:50.68]And I don't know, who else?
[162:54.83]Spam?
[162:55.01]Spam?
[162:57.97]Raw or maybe Raw and Sherbert.
[163:02.49]Or Raw and Spud.
[163:04.93]Squirey.
[163:05.61]Spud's not old enough.
[163:08.28]We get something interesting here.
[163:09.20]For these two.
[163:17.28]Go.
[163:17.34]Alright, somehow this one has an even smaller head.
[163:28.15]Look at this one.
[163:30.20]The legs are so long.
[163:38.16]And probably the this one just like the this one here.
[163:52.41]Even longer.
[163:57.08]Remember, this is unethical.
[164:10.45]Whoa!
[164:13.83]Oh, I think this is it, right?
[164:15.61]Should I keep going or should I breed this one?
[164:18.05]Look at that.
[164:18.51]That's like a Gigachad.
[164:26.33]I think I keep this one.
[164:28.91]I'm gonna keep this one.
[164:34.09]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 legs?
[164:35.83]This one can actually walk.
[164:46.08]Name this one Impostor.
[164:48.94]Aw.
[164:50.66]Smush loves the playroom.
[164:53.79]He's having trouble.
[164:54.49]He's like, I don't know what to do with this ball.
[164:57.11]Why can't I pick the ball up with my mouth?
[164:58.53]It's not fair.
[165:00.46]It's too heavy.
[165:02.56]What?
[165:08.82]Who just did that?
[165:15.88]Oh, Smush, you're having such a good time.
[165:17.67]Oh, Smush is hoarding.
[165:22.75]I get it.
[165:23.23]Okay.
[165:26.93]Smoshit might be my new favorite.
[165:38.88]Spud has not left the top right corner the whole time we've been playing.
[165:42.34]The entire time.
[165:51.05]Ooh, got your own food.
[165:56.18]It's a mess up here.
[165:56.86]What are you doing?
[165:58.52]Sherbert, how are you doing?
[166:02.04]Just playing?
[166:03.38]Oh, you're building.
[166:06.93]Very smart.
[166:09.57]Very smart.
[166:11.93]Okay.
[166:13.65]Very good.
[166:14.01]Do that again.
[166:15.93]Very, very good.
[166:17.19]Very smart.
[166:17.65]It's a mess up here.
[166:33.90]I got a reward for throwing up.
[166:36.78]Garlic bulb.
[166:41.79]Want some garlic?
[166:44.99]I'm gonna feed the gar- Smush!
[166:52.03]Do you want some garlic, Smush?
[166:53.99]Oh no, he's like sweating.
[166:57.33]Stop doing that!
[166:58.47]You guys are gonna get hurt.
[166:59.21]I think everyone is hungry.
[167:05.10]Try some garlic.
[167:05.74]It's good for you.
[167:07.52]Well, no, it's not good for dogs, but like in the sense of out of context.
[167:16.71]Smush wants to eat that, yeah.
[167:20.77]Yeah, do not... Okay, what is it?
[167:24.54]Shallots?
[167:25.42]Like onions?
[167:26.10]Garlic?
[167:28.06]Anything that's like a shallot, right?
[167:31.86]That was like cool, so I'm gonna praise you.
[167:37.59]Uh, onions, garlic, grapes, chocolate.
[167:42.28]There's actually a lot of things your dog really can't have.
[167:47.48]What's wrong?
[167:49.20]You alright?
[167:52.38]Something healthy.
[167:55.34]There.
[167:57.47]Eat like a nutrition pellet.
[168:00.85]You okay?
[168:02.29]Try that.
[168:07.57]Yeah, eat something that's good for you.
[168:12.25]Take it out.
[168:14.81]Get some garlic.
[168:20.56]Save?
[168:20.94]Oh my god.
[168:26.16]Alright, new friend available, I think.
[168:35.41]Tremendous.
[168:36.13]That's actually a really good name.
[168:40.69]Snacks.
[168:41.61]Chowder.
[168:42.85]Scout.
[168:43.69]Damper.
[168:46.77]Corn.
[168:49.09]Steak fry.
[168:51.63]Tuba?
[168:52.79]I like tuba.
[168:53.57]Okay, tuba.
[168:59.59]What are you gonna eat?
[169:00.35]How about some healthy stuff?
[169:01.95]How about a coconut?
[169:03.31]No, a...
[169:08.43]I don't know.
[169:09.89]What should we... Come over here.
[169:11.43]I want you over here.
[169:17.21]Cityscape.
[169:17.93]Ooh, let me try that.
[169:26.63]Uh-oh.
[169:28.17]Spam is getting older.
[169:29.07]Okay.
[169:32.58]Spam's getting old.
[169:34.80]That's not bad.
[169:38.34]Where's Spam?
[169:40.46]What's Spud?
[169:40.98]Spud's hungry.
[169:45.46]I'll eat this.
[169:45.80]I know, Spud has trouble moving around, right?
[169:51.99]Where's Spam?
[169:55.21]Alright, Spam's getting old.
[169:55.99]We're going to have to breed Spam.
[170:00.47]I need an egg.
[170:00.95]Spam was mean.
[170:04.38]This is Penance.
[170:04.82]Penance.
[170:07.39]Tuba is currently... I think they're playing.
[170:20.84]Tuba's just a puppy, though.
[170:26.50]Um... Spud, are you... Oh, an egg!
[170:32.65]Alright, stop, stop, stop.
[170:33.67]That's enough, that's enough.
[170:34.51]That's enough, that's enough.
[170:35.25]Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go.
[170:43.50]Oh, okay.
[170:43.92]I was like, what happened?
[170:45.38]Alright, it's okay, spud.
[170:53.21]It's okay.
[170:55.99]Go sleep next to your brother.
[170:57.77]Alright.
[171:00.81]Ooh, sofa.
[171:07.13]You not sleep here?
[171:13.42]Take a nap.
[171:16.95]Sleep.
[171:17.45]Go to sleep.
[171:22.95]Stop.
[171:23.97]What is going on over here?
[171:26.97]Leave each other alone.
[171:32.42]Stop it.
[171:33.10]Who is that?
[171:34.12]Smush.
[171:34.80]Leave him.
[171:40.70]Put him down.
[171:41.52]Enough.
[171:42.60]It's okay.
[171:46.58]That's enough.
[171:54.44]Alright, sure, eat this.
[171:59.98]Put him down?
[172:00.46]Yeah, no, I mean, like, put him down, like, put him, he's holding him.
[172:05.50]How do you clean the dogs?
[172:08.84]Is it filthy?
[172:09.42]Is that why they keep on sweating?
[172:16.69]Smosh, you're kind of a psycho.
[172:23.20]Here, have some of that.
[172:23.82]Alright, we need to do some breeding.
[172:32.02]I got eggs.
[172:32.42]Alright, now we're going to do raw and spam.
[172:44.15]I think that makes some sense.
[172:49.86]And we're going to go to like zero with this one.
[172:51.38]Let me see what we can make here.
[173:07.75]Look at this, how small this one's head is.
[173:08.91]Alright, that's interesting.
[173:24.17]Alright, getting weirder.
[173:34.87]Still at 98% stability.
[173:47.06]Huge.
[173:48.18]Huge legs too, yeah.
[173:54.96]Four.
[173:57.32]Green.
[174:00.48]Alright, let's do this.
[174:02.32]And... I don't know.
[174:05.01]One of the big ones?
[174:05.85]Probably, yeah.
[174:10.55]Hell yeah.
[174:10.97]There we go.
[174:15.11]Interesting.
[174:15.71]I like that one.
[174:17.81]And I like this one.
[174:26.11]This one?
[174:26.79]This one's kind of just like... This one's getting kind of walked over.
[174:40.90]Alright, how about this one?
[174:44.04]And this one.
[174:50.71]Whoa, okay.
[174:52.69]They kind of look like a truck.
[175:07.05]How many legs do they have?
[175:08.41]Looks like a garbage truck.
[175:15.81]Whoa!
[175:26.19]Okay.
[175:31.23]I'm gonna keep going.
[175:39.17]Okay.
[175:48.86]This is the one.
[175:58.95]John Deere?
[176:03.75]Okay, again.
[176:04.25]We're gonna do... Should I wait?
[176:13.46]What about spamming squarey?
[176:14.48]See if we can get something cool here.
[176:25.72]Kind of cool already.
[176:26.54]One with the huge nose.
[176:35.17]I want a dog with like a giant, like, nose.
[176:52.21]Big.
[176:54.97]Who has the biggest nose here?
[176:55.89]Probably you.
[176:56.25]Yep.
[177:02.74]You.
[177:04.08]Getting a little longer.
[177:04.82]I think you also have the big one.
[177:14.95]Okay.
[177:17.99]I like the guy in the middle here.
[177:23.86]And you.
[177:24.74]Keep going.
[177:29.74]Keep going.
[177:36.82]Getting a lot paler.
[177:37.82]Uh-oh.
[177:47.74]Whoa, look at the tail!
[177:51.35]That tail is huge!
[177:53.61]Okay, hold on.
[178:03.27]Oh wow, that's awesome.
[178:04.71]Okay.
[178:06.19]I think I stick with one here.
[178:11.29]Or do I keep going?
[178:15.92]Who has the longest tail?
[178:26.64]I think this is the one.
[178:27.52]I think it's this one here.
[178:35.45]One more?
[178:35.73]Alright, one more.
[178:48.87]We lost the color.
[178:49.91]Shit.
[178:50.89]Alright, one more.
[178:58.61]Alright, we got one, we got one.
[179:04.04]That was, did you see that move?
[179:08.34]They're perfect.
[179:21.95]Perfect.
[179:30.14]Okay.
[179:34.42]These are wildly different.
[179:36.90]We're going to do some incubation here.
[179:37.98]Okay.
[179:39.72]How are people doing?
[179:40.76]People hungry?
[179:41.22]Anybody dying?
[179:43.04]Get some food if you want it.
[179:48.26]How are you guys doing?
[179:59.97]Eat some food.
[180:00.71]Everybody needs to get up there and eat.
[180:02.17]You can't just, like, sit down here.
[180:03.47]Alright, so, Spike.
[180:09.03]How about, um, people saying Courage.
[180:10.69]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[180:14.39]How about Courage?
[180:15.85]How about Courage with a 6?
[180:23.50]Because it's got 6 legs.
[180:35.21]Ryu's not right.

[192:31.86]I'm going on a full cleanup spree here.
[192:36.74]I need... Alright, build mode.

[192:42.72]This is absurd.
[192:46.96]There's too much, how do I clean this up?
[192:57.41]I'll leave a little, but not all this shit.
[193:05.57]I'll leave like a patch over here.
[193:06.69]I'm realizing how fucking filthy it is here.
[193:14.08]It's no wonder they're all dripping and sweaty and sick and stuff.
[193:18.00]Underneath all the grass, it's been a bunch of puke and piss and shit.
[193:25.49]Oh my god, it's like Rollercoaster Tycoon.
[193:29.03]Oh my god.
[193:29.65]Guys, this is bad.
[193:50.32]I'm gonna leave a patch over here.
[193:51.28]I know they're pretty, but I don't, like, no.
[193:55.70]It's too much.
[194:06.30]Like, that's fine.
[194:07.00]Like, right here.
[194:12.79]They are launching out of the tube and sliding across all this filth.
[194:22.02]Okay.
[194:23.70]Um... Oh my god, what a joke.
[194:35.28]Maybe that's why they weren't living that long.
[194:48.15]It was under the... How was I supposed to see it?
[194:49.65]It was under the grass.
[195:04.16]There's shit everywhere.
[195:08.22]Jesus!
[195:11.16]Sometimes they move way too fast.
[195:22.91]I hope they can't get injured that way.
[195:32.36]You can't even see it under here.
[195:33.90]How was I supposed to see this?
[195:38.34]Okay.
[195:39.02]That's much cleaner.
[195:40.82]Looks much better.
[195:50.29]What about the other rooms?
[196:06.19]That's fine.
[196:06.85]That's fine.
[196:07.15]Okay.
[196:07.51]I need the other rooms now.

[197:47.15]Let him go!
[197:47.75]Let him go!
[197:48.49]Let him go!
[197:48.95]How do I stop?
[197:51.37]Let him go!
[198:03.51]Who has who?
[198:05.55]Oh my god, it's not you, it's you!
[198:07.15]Put him down!
[198:12.95]Oh my god.
[198:16.72]No.
[198:21.02]He sounds like a Minecraft zombie.
[198:22.52]Alright, I'm losing control here.
[198:24.96]Oh my god, are you okay?
[198:27.26]Here, eat a banana, quick.
[198:33.82]It's okay.

[200:45.31]I'm sorry.
[200:46.47]I'm sorry.

[201:15.35]It's delicious, isn't it?
[201:16.39]Okay, we need some more.
[201:17.61]That's not just junk food.
[201:22.26]There we go.
[201:22.92]Alright, alright, alright.
[201:23.76]Everything's fine.
[201:28.09]Very good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[201:30.81]Very good.
[201:32.05]Very good.
[201:32.51]It's okay.
[201:33.11]Very good.
[201:34.86]I was too busy cleaning.
[201:35.76]I didn't realize all this shit was going on up here.
[201:38.98]Everybody alright?
[201:51.49]I need to, can I hire someone?
[201:53.15]You've been doing this for like an hour.
[201:57.13]Honest to God, Raw has been doing this for like a full hour in the game.
[202:24.64]I don't think rock can walk.
[202:31.97]Oh my goodness.
[202:34.59]No, get away from this.
[202:36.05]Stop.
[203:11.65]Alright, now go to sleep.
[203:17.10]Not seeing very much growth here.
[203:19.20]Squarry is getting old.
[203:20.40]Okay, alright.
[203:22.26]I need to see some growth here.
[203:23.34]Alright, that was tuba.
[203:29.59]We wanted tuba to shrink.
[203:32.15]Which we did.
[203:35.01]Lost a little bit of size.
[203:40.40]Okay, that's what we wanted.
[203:50.17]Okay, John.
[203:50.67]Okay, legs got a little thicker.
[203:55.81]That's good.
[203:58.33]Alright, Courage.
[204:01.86]I kind of screwed up Courage a little bit.
[204:03.36]Because I was trying to do nose and ears, right?
[204:07.08]Seems like the color is kind of changing a little bit.
[204:10.38]Nose size went up 10% though.
[204:11.89]That's huge.
[204:17.68]Okay, I need to start storing people because I don't have enough space.
[204:23.56]I'm going to store Squari.
[204:24.80]I'm going to store two people.
[204:27.94]I'm running out of real estate here.
[204:40.13]Let's give you like a coconut or something and then we're going to put you in the storage unit.
[204:46.59]We're going to try to.
[204:49.08]Try that.
[204:49.40]Eat that before I put you in the storage.
[204:59.08]Why are they so dumb?
[205:06.90]Just eat it.
[205:07.40]Okay.
[205:18.42]Who is going... I need to go to my menu here.
[205:20.08]Okay.
[205:20.54]Storage.
[205:22.74]I'm going to take... Squari.
[205:27.02]I'm going to store Squari.
[205:31.71]Who else do I want to store for now?
[205:34.47]I want Courage out there.
[205:35.23]I want John out there.
[205:35.95]I want Ra out there.
[205:36.85]I want... Maybe Sherbert.
[205:38.89]Or Spud.
[205:39.55]Or... I think Sherbert gets... Is it Broom?
[205:46.40]Broom?
[205:53.04]Sherbert's cool.
[205:53.64]Yeah, well, don't... Sorry.
[205:57.58]Oh, I have mud as a stored core.
[206:03.71]Okay.
[206:04.69]Let's clean up.
[206:09.59]Raw's getting old.
[206:13.01]Oh, no.
[206:13.89]We gotta breed another... We gotta have raw come out and breed...
[206:28.51]Okay, make sure they're happy.
[206:29.49]How you doing over here, tuba?
[206:32.33]Do you want to have a chicken nugget?
[206:36.11]Okay.
[206:37.69]Um, go play with something.
[206:38.69]There's tons of toys everywhere.
[206:40.05]Here, come here.
[206:58.15]Uh, play with this.
[207:02.36]That's good, yeah.
[207:03.12]Play with that.
[207:04.04]It's fun.
[207:06.82]I don't want to do that.
[207:07.62]Okay, well, come here.
[207:15.07]Clean up.
[207:16.07]Do you understand I spent the last 20 minutes air frying, whatever it is, this stuff all over the ground?
[207:22.67]It's back immediately.
[207:36.04]The broom?
[207:36.52]This will remove all physics objects from this room.
[207:43.26]Food will be destroyed.
[207:44.20]Eggs and seeds will be collected.
[207:45.40]Toys and dog cars will be put away.
[207:46.70]Unopened capsules will be lost.
[207:49.05]Do I have any unopened capsules?
[207:53.13]I gotta check that first.
[207:53.93]I don't want to do that until I'm certain of it.
[207:56.81]I'm fine.
[208:04.01]Let me just check.
[208:10.08]Okay.
[208:11.98]Clean.
[208:15.92]Guys, that doesn't do anything.
[208:17.88]There's still piss all over the ground in every room.
[208:23.81]Oh my god, you've been in the cocoon for so long.
[208:25.57]Okay.
[208:36.57]Oh jeez.
[208:38.53]This bud's gotten bigger.
[208:43.99]10% back legs.
[208:47.71]Pretty much like 2-3% across the board for body.
[208:49.43]Do you spot in raw right now?
[209:04.18]I will in just a sec.
[209:04.94]Okay.
[209:22.55]Everything alright up here?
[209:28.91]Smush.
[209:30.00]Tuba's not doing alright.
[209:31.10]Tuba, you need to go to bed.
[209:33.88]Oh!
[209:35.40]What's wrong?
[209:38.64]What, did he just puke?
[209:40.74]Oh no.
[209:41.90]Um, it's okay.
[209:42.47]Okay.
[209:49.10]Are they sick?
[209:50.63]Ooh, courage is gonna do it.
[209:51.91]Come on.
[209:57.57]Yes!
[209:58.53]Very good.
[209:59.91]Very, very good.
[210:28.38]Jesus Christ.
[210:44.89]Are we finally fucking clean?
[210:46.35]Alright, we're good.
[210:55.33]John, go eat a honeycomb.
[211:00.71]No!
[211:04.34]Okay, we need to breed.
[211:05.06]Before it's too late.
[211:12.52]I got another room.
[211:13.14]I don't have any eggs.
[211:21.58]I'm out of eggs.
[211:22.22]What do you want for food?
[211:22.94]You want a gourd?
[211:28.10]Give it a try.
[211:31.88]But how you doing?
[211:32.38]You don't look so good.
[211:34.08]Kind of struggling over here.
[211:34.96]Uh-oh.
[211:40.48]Wait!
[211:41.34]I wasn't ready to say goodbye!
[211:42.34]I wasn't ready to say goodbye!
[211:45.49]Oh!
[212:12.01]I heard you coming downstairs.
[212:20.79]No, don't let John Deere eat that first.
[212:34.03]Go eat the eraser.
[212:40.14]You don't want it?
[213:13.79]Don't eat that.
[213:14.45]I'm trying just to get it out of here.
[213:24.15]Get it out.
[213:26.02]How come I can't take this out of here?
[213:38.95]Expel?
[213:39.51]Oh, okay.
[213:44.50]We're going to have the memorial be... We're going to have a different room.
[213:49.60]Okay.
[213:50.08]Different room.
[213:51.18]The memorial is going to be over here.
[213:52.90]Okay.
[214:06.57]Okay.
[214:11.21]Is it gonna be like a somber area?
[214:15.89]This is the memorial.
[214:23.02]Like a comfy dog chair or something, right?
[214:31.49]And... I don't know.
[214:41.85]Maybe like something... What would a dog like here?
[214:45.94]No, I don't like this.
[214:47.92]Not mud.
[214:50.98]No.
[214:51.82]No.
[214:52.48]Something comfy.
[214:54.16]Something comfortable.
[214:58.12]That's kind of comfy.
[215:02.56]This is comfy.
[215:05.30]Put a tree in there?
[215:06.03]Yeah, I'll put a tree in here.
[215:12.03]Yeah, this tree is going to go up here.
[215:13.29]Okay.
[215:22.21]Okay.
[215:35.92]Alright, now we need to move the memorials here.
[215:37.48]There's one up here.
[215:43.58]How do I take this with me?
[215:48.74]I like, how do I move this to the other room?
[215:57.12]I just remove, remove the core.
[215:58.16]I don't, how do I store it?
[215:58.94]Remove core.
[216:01.24]Okay.
[216:09.18]Uh, put away.
[216:12.39]Okay, so now... Go away.
[216:20.13]Okay.
[216:25.12]So now we're gonna... Oh, they all need to mutate.
[216:26.96]Alright, I'll be with you in one moment.
[216:29.78]Hold on, everybody.
[216:30.46]Okay.
[216:36.99]Oh my god.
[216:37.77]Okay, where is this thing?
[216:44.59]Gravity machine?
[216:45.47]Okay, so now where the hell is this here?
[216:50.69]Stored cores.
[216:52.29]Bring out.
[217:06.02]I gotta increase my, like, mouse sensitivity.
[217:07.60]This is, like, horrible.
[217:08.50]How do I do that?
[217:17.94]Am I not?
[217:24.88]That's better.
[217:31.57]One DPI?
[217:32.29]I know, I'm like... I have to fucking move up and down.
[217:36.01]Okay, so... This is not bad.
[217:40.82]I want to make them a little bigger, though.
[217:53.36]No one's going to be bigger than anyone else.
[218:00.52]Except... Actually, you get to be a little bit bigger.
[218:08.25]This was Mud.
[218:09.07]Mud was a good dog.
[218:09.85]He was one of the first dogs.
[218:11.89]And this was Raw.
[218:20.09]Always made us laugh.
[218:26.86]Let's get some mutations going.
[218:27.96]Feed your dogs?
[218:52.88]Come on, Toad.
[218:53.68]Whatever your name is.
[218:54.32]Hurry up.
[218:59.25]Oh, an egg.
[219:01.09]Okay, you come out here.
[219:02.23]Because you need to eat.
[219:13.48]Alright, Spud.
[219:14.82]Let's give you some cheese.
[219:21.60]And then I want you to... Well, let's just rub your belly first.
[219:32.44]Who was about to die?
[219:33.34]Somebody was, right?
[219:34.02]Get some cheese.
[219:43.79]Revive the dead dogs?
[219:44.85]I think you can use their cores.
[219:47.91]Spud.
[219:50.03]How can I help you here?
[219:56.25]Turn.
[219:57.47]Rotate.
[219:58.43]How do I rotate them?
[220:01.05]Okay, there we go.
[220:02.22]Here.
[220:03.68]Eat.
[220:06.16]Have a burrito, too.
[220:08.94]There's way more filling, and you're huge.
[220:11.32]Eat it.
[220:11.54]There we go.
[220:20.54]Way more filling.
[220:21.26]That's good.
[220:21.66]Okay, you're good.
[220:22.46]Let's see what we get.
[220:30.39]Color change.
[220:34.37]Okay, Smush is now an adult.
[220:40.17]Smaller ears.
[220:45.61]Piss everywhere.
[220:51.14]Good job.
[220:54.14]I gotta be more on top of this.
[220:56.22]The piss and shit everywhere.
[221:06.93]Ooh.
[221:09.27]New coat?
[221:12.97]A little lighter.
[221:19.23]Oh, no.
[221:20.35]Snout reduced.
[221:21.87]That's not what we want.
[221:22.53]A little glossier.
[221:28.78]I want to give courage wings.
[221:44.03]What's the food that gives wings?
[221:45.09]Remember Red Bull?
[221:51.09]What gives wings?
[221:53.73]Wings gut bacteria is the yellow one.
[221:58.70]Tiny wings.
[221:59.62]Okay, this is from onion rings, gourds, and... Okay, let's see if we can get it from here.
[222:03.70]Guava.
[222:05.06]Guava.
[222:25.97]Over here.
[222:26.19]Alright.
[222:30.83]We want you to grow some wings.
[222:41.20]There you go.
[222:42.46]The yellow one, right?
[222:44.48]That one?
[222:46.08]That one.
[222:46.72]Good.
[222:47.88]Alright, now you can go sleep.
[222:57.68]Eat good, Courage?
[222:58.96]Yeah.
[223:03.63]Not much change for John.
[223:06.69]Although, a lot glossier.
[223:09.79]Interesting.
[223:16.07]Isn't this just Bugsnax?
[223:17.87]Um... It's a little different, I think.
[223:26.18]Tuba's still shrinking.
[223:29.47]Even smaller.
[223:30.01]Look at how cute Tube is.
[223:34.80]Tube is so cute.
[223:36.80]I gotta pee again.
[223:37.74]God damn it.
[223:38.28]Alright, I'll be right back.
[223:39.74]Alright, no more BRBs after this.
[223:50.94]How do I pause the game?
[223:51.58]Can you pause?
[224:00.41]There's no pause.
[224:02.83]Well, then, here.
[224:03.72]Just watch.
[224:04.76]You guys can just watch.
[224:07.14]I'll be right back.
[224:44.94]It's been a long time since I've been here.
[224:50.54]It's been a long time since I've been here.
[225:30.05]This is the first time I've seen a male Oriental greenfinch.
[225:58.90]What did I miss?
[226:00.62]Anything bad happen while I was gone?
[226:04.47]Oh, also, now that there's a lot more people here, July 14th is the baseball stream.
[226:13.49]If you want to see that stream, mark it on your calendar.
[226:15.47]Baseball, the Jerma Baseball Association will commence, start, and end, begin, on July 14th.
[226:25.84]Mark it!
[226:31.79]Okay, you're tired.
[226:34.81]I have access to an egg.
[226:36.87]What do I want to do here?
[226:44.13]I think I want to wait till... Okay.
[226:47.77]Once tuba is old enough, should I do spud and... No, spud and smoosh?
[226:54.78]I don't know.
[227:00.39]Yeah, wait till Courage is old enough.
[227:02.01]Courage and John, I think, would be good.
[227:04.66]Oh, wait.
[227:09.82]I think I only have one egg.
[227:11.38]Yeah, I only have one egg.
[227:16.14]Alright, Spud, I'm gonna need you to... Uh... Chill out.
[227:22.95]Go to sleep.
[227:28.71]Get some sleep.
[227:34.04]Okay, you're stressed out.
[227:35.12]Why?
[227:35.40]What's wrong?
[227:37.71]What's wrong?
[227:38.09]What's wrong?
[227:38.43]What's wrong?
[227:38.75]You okay?
[227:42.07]Why are you so stressed out?
[227:43.09]Alright, relax.
[227:48.73]Alright, wings.
[227:54.80]I need to feed Courage more stuff.
[228:01.12]Courage, I want wings, which is... Okay, Courage, come on here.
[228:11.12]I'm out of here, Carge.
[228:11.76]Get over here.
[228:17.42]Spud, please move out of the way.
[228:20.24]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[228:21.24]Put that down.
[228:21.93]You need to eat because you need to get wings.
[228:23.17]I want you to grow wings.
[228:26.17]There you go.
[228:26.47]Good dog.
[228:35.29]Good.
[228:36.53]Okay, now you can do whatever you want.
[228:42.93]I don't know how you could be so dumb.
[228:49.77]Ooh, an egg!
[228:53.43]He's trying to eat the food, but he... You're on the wrong side, man.
[228:58.31]Alright, everyone's doing okay.
[229:09.04]One more mutation and we'll be able to do it again.
[229:20.87]Here, have some honey.
[229:24.01]Have some honey.
[229:27.47]There you go.
[229:28.36]There you go.
[229:29.16]That's a good dog.
[229:30.76]There you go.
[229:35.18]Go to sleep if you need to.
[229:44.63]MonkaS.
[229:47.64]Okay, everyone seems to be in good spirits.
[229:49.08]Spud?
[229:49.66]I don't know what's wrong with Spud.
[229:51.69]I really don't.
[229:52.49]He's not doing great.
[229:57.89]He can't, like, walk around to get food.
[230:01.77]You need to get some sleep.
[230:04.39]It's so quiet up here.
[230:05.22]Just go relax in the corner.
[230:07.18]What could he say?
[230:07.74]He has so much trouble moving.
[230:09.08]Why?
[230:11.10]Come on.
[230:11.88]You can eat it.
[230:17.98]Alright.
[230:18.84]Now go.
[230:25.21]Okay.
[230:29.05]Good.
[230:29.23]I want you to be healthy.
[230:31.01]Not all screwed up.
[230:36.99]Okay.
[230:42.33]Everybody seems to be fine.
[230:43.27]Easy.
[230:45.85]Easy.
[230:49.30]Oh, do you want some more guava?
[230:52.08]Eat it.
[230:53.78]Yeah, because I'm trying to get the wings.
[231:03.51]Very good.
[231:09.33]The man just needed a ham slider.
[231:11.23]Alright, you're awake.
[231:15.87]Eat another one of those.
[231:16.67]I don't know.
[231:17.19]I figured this does something weird.
[231:24.28]Eat another ham slider.
[231:26.25]Train them to do stuff?
[231:28.77]Um, how?
[231:32.69]That was a papaya?
[231:34.15]That's alright.
[231:36.71]I don't know if I want to breed Spud.
[231:39.23]Spud can't really walk.
[231:43.84]Spud's a really good dog, but he can't really walk around.
[231:50.40]Yeah, he's a lot of trouble moving around.
[231:51.52]I don't know why.
[231:52.96]His body seems to be proportionally fine.
[231:54.60]His body's, like, perfectly fine.
[231:59.26]Maybe they're too far forward?
[232:03.25]He's having a lot of trouble.
[232:16.14]Alright, Smush, eat something.
[232:24.67]Have some?
[232:27.08]Go to bed!
[232:27.66]Go to bed!
[232:38.76]Here, eat.
[232:39.83]Banana.
[232:43.87]Go to bed.
[232:46.07]Go to bed.
[232:58.02]No, what are you doing?
[233:00.82]What are you doing?
[233:01.40]No, what are you doing?
[233:03.28]Stop it.
[233:04.88]What are you doing, my Wellington?
[233:05.90]Stop.
[233:06.14]Alright, but wait, wait, wait.
[233:11.49]Here we go, here we go.
[233:14.85]One more guava.
[233:15.45]Let's see if we get wings.
[233:20.27]I thought you retired that.
[233:24.33]Holy shit.
[233:29.16]Wow, okay.
[233:30.40]That would have been a fucking disaster.
[233:35.46]That would have gotten all... That would have dropped everywhere.
[233:37.50]It would have gotten all over me.
[233:38.36]Alright, come on.
[233:41.90]Wings.
[233:47.14]I thought you retired that.
[233:48.40]That's so funny.
[234:00.06]Alright, pray for wings.
[234:08.79]Wings, come on.
[234:16.90]Yes!
[234:17.38]No!
[234:17.64]Alright, kind of cool though.
[234:27.87]Actually, it looks really cool.
[234:29.89]Probably the best looking dog we've had so far.
[234:37.18]Alright, now it's time to do some breeding.
[234:44.44]And I'm going to sneeze.
[235:05.86]I'm realizing how fucked up that was.
[235:07.36]Alright.
[235:19.47]Why does tuba take the longest to do this?
[235:21.09]How come I look purple?
[235:29.93]I don't... Dude, I don't know.
[235:32.51]I have no idea why I look purple.
[235:35.55]Your guess is as good as mine.
[235:36.57]Are you kidding me?
[235:40.23]There's a slide now.
[235:53.38]Still shrinking.
[235:55.10]Still shrinking by about 5% every time.
[235:56.88]Okay.
[235:57.06]Okay.
[236:02.23]Let's see what we got here.
[236:02.83]Let's do some breeding.
[236:20.18]Lost a lot of leg gloss, which is weird.
[236:22.62]Alright.
[236:22.96]Should I put the slide down?
[236:23.90]Alright, dude, what are you doing?
[236:27.42]Relax.
[236:30.20]Okay, let's breed.
[236:31.86]Let's do it.
[236:33.59]This is where it gets... It's going to be weird here.
[236:36.97]Courage.
[236:39.43]And tuba.
[236:42.01]Or should we do... Spud.
[236:46.63]Or John.
[236:49.58]What would make the most interesting combination here?
[236:58.30]Probably...
[237:01.03]Alright, let's see if we get something crazy.
[237:08.92]Interesting.
[237:12.73]I'm thinking I like this one the most.
[237:18.07]Look at this tiny little head and tiny little nose.
[237:20.80]Yeah.
[237:30.67]Wow, alright.
[237:32.31]I love this one.
[237:33.13]I can't say I love this one too.
[237:37.03]Okay, I like these two.
[237:44.88]Huge tail on this one.
[237:46.00]And this one.
[237:55.45]Another massive tail.
[238:00.27]And this one here.
[238:04.30]The tail just keeps getting longer.
[238:07.22]I wonder if I should just take this one.
[238:19.70]Oh God.
[238:20.25]Alright.
[238:20.79]We're at 89% stability.
[238:34.16]Purple, but doesn't have a huge tail.
[238:35.68]This one has a massive tail.
[238:41.23]And the purple one.
[238:41.81]Maybe we get something in between.
[238:57.80]There we go.
[238:59.22]It's Rocko from Rocko's Modern Life.
[239:04.59]I think I stay on this one.
[239:09.59]But look at this one, it's got a Rudolph nose.
[239:15.88]Do I dare try it one more time?
[239:18.24]Or should I combine Rudolph and Croco?
[239:38.98]Oh jeez, okay.
[239:46.03]Again?
[239:46.31]Do it again?
[239:48.25]Alright, the pool is getting a lot smaller.
[239:56.97]Stop saying oh jeez.
[239:58.55]Oh jeez.
[239:59.34]Am I saying oh jeez a lot today?
[240:00.78]Am I?
[240:01.00]Am I saying oh jeez?
[240:03.24]No, I'm not.
[240:16.66]I don't know.
[240:17.20]I'm not sure.
[240:17.74]I think it's this one right here.
[240:19.60]I like the red though.
[240:40.52]I think this is best of both worlds here.
[240:43.34]Yeah.
[240:44.08]This is the one.
[240:53.94]That's best of both worlds.
[240:57.34]Alright, let's do it again.
[241:10.87]This time we're going to do... What do we do now?
[241:18.92]John Deere and... Smush?
[241:21.36]Smush?
[241:23.31]Or John Deere and... No, no, no, no, no.
[241:28.54]John Deere and Courage.
[241:35.69]What about Sherbert?
[241:36.23]I feel like we're... I think... I like the blue.
[241:39.25]Let's go for it.
[241:46.72]What about Spud?
[241:49.82]Where's Spud?
[241:52.28]No, I don't... Spud is not doing so well.
[242:13.33]Cool.
[242:19.93]Maybe... I wonder what... Maybe we'll get a...
[242:26.70]I like, I think I don't want to do anything else.
[242:28.54]This one looks like a squirrel.
[242:29.46]I think I'm with the squirrel.
[243:04.86]Oh, oh, this one's fucking weird.
[243:07.11]It's freaking me out.
[243:12.35]Keep that one.
[243:31.12]This one can't move.
[243:34.94]Okay, so here comes... How about as Rudolph?
[243:39.70]Rudolph?
[243:49.55]Rutan is actually a pretty good name, yeah.
[243:53.07]I like Rudolph.
[244:01.92]Alright, it's time to eat.
[244:12.19]I still have another egg, don't I?
[244:13.75]No, I don't.
[244:14.25]Shit.
[244:16.67]Okay.
[244:19.69]Why would you do this to animals?
[244:22.90]Um... I don't know.
[244:25.56]It's wobble dogs.
[244:29.22]This is...
[244:30.99]What do you mean?
[244:31.93]Why did you do this?
[244:35.85]Yeah, bro, it's a cartoon, alright?
[244:38.11]It's a fucking cartoon.
[244:39.15]Alright, get rid of this.
[244:43.96]Play with the ball.
[244:50.34]Somebody just got sucked up.
[244:53.70]Yo, bro, it's a cartoon, alright?
[244:59.37]Anybody hungry?
[245:02.76]Alright, courage again.
[245:03.76]I want you to eat.
[245:04.58]Please.
[245:06.03]I want wings.
[245:21.40]That's a bad defense.
[245:22.36]Okay.
[245:35.20]They all have six legs.
[245:36.94]I'm trying.
[245:37.36]I want somebody with like nine or ten legs.
[245:39.93]I want like a centipede.
[245:40.81]What are you doing up here, Rudolph?
[245:44.21]Paying your respects to the... What a good boy.
[245:47.55]Want to go sit in the chair?
[245:50.09]You want to do some tricks?
[245:55.90]Roll over.
[245:57.74]Wow, so smart already.
[246:00.40]Already so smart.
[246:07.33]Do it again.
[246:08.61]Speak.
[246:10.95]Brilliant dog.
[246:15.95]Roll over.
[246:20.02]Brilliant.
[246:22.04]Good job.
[246:22.62]Do it again.
[246:26.88]Come on.
[246:27.76]You can do it.
[246:33.84]Come on.
[246:47.25]He's having a good time.
[246:48.15]Alright, I got a deviled egg.
[246:49.41]Good job.
[246:58.00]Somebody eat a deviled egg.
[247:08.29]What's happening over here?
[247:10.17]Why do they have so much trouble getting food?
[247:11.75]Here, here, have some deviled eggs, honey.
[247:25.71]Why do they have so much trouble eating?
[247:28.15]Like, what's going on?
[247:28.89]Eat it.
[247:35.07]Come on, eat the deviled egg.
[247:45.40]Everybody have some deviled eggs.
[247:47.48]Deviled eggs are fucking so gross.
[247:50.66]But they're incredible when you want one.
[248:00.46]Like, when you really, really want one, it's like, holy shit, this is the greatest thing I've ever eaten in my whole life.
[248:06.90]Nine out of ten scenarios, they're the grossest fucking food you could ever eat.
[248:11.35]You need to eat a deviled egg right when it's made.
[248:13.97]And not a second after that.
[248:16.29]Not one second after.
[248:23.17]If a deviled egg is even sitting out for five minutes, nope.
[248:28.16]I won't eat it.
[248:29.28]I refuse.
[248:38.68]Nope.
[248:41.63]I feel the same way about hard-boiled eggs.
[248:45.21]A fresh, hard-boiled egg.
[248:48.21]You peel off the... You peel off the outer shell.
[248:52.25]And it's just hot.
[248:53.53]Salt.
[248:54.32]Pepper.
[248:55.40]Eat it hot.
[248:57.38]When you put hard-boiled eggs in the fridge in a container... They stink.
[249:04.50]Every...
[249:05.90]All you hard-boiled egg lovers, listen to me closely.
[249:09.72]When you go to the fridge, and you open up that container of hard- you take the container out, everybody sits there and goes... When I open this, it's gonna be- it's gonna be disgusting.
[249:20.77]But one or two seconds after you take the lid off, it stinks like fucking rotten eggs for ten seconds, and then you go, okay, I'm fine.
[249:31.44]It's like that every- it just had that- that grow- oh my god, you're hungry.
[249:39.18]What do you want?
[249:39.70]What kind of food do you want?
[249:43.34]Burrito.
[249:47.30]A hot deviled- No, no, no, no.
[249:50.31]Deviled- If an egg is in a container for too long, it smells awful.
[249:55.59]Just eat them fresh.
[249:57.33]I- When I used to lift all the time, I would have like a dozen hard-boiled eggs in a container.
[250:02.68]And I know, I sound like a fucking old lady right now, but bear with me.
[250:05.40]Something's wrong with my throat.
[250:07.97]When I was, like, 25, I would eat... I would have a hard-boiled... I would have, like, three hard-boiled eggs a day.
[250:16.13]Four.
[250:18.06]And it kind of hated it.
[250:19.96]It was just like, oh, this, like, kind of smells it.
[250:23.12]Even when they... Not even a day goes by.
[250:25.64]One day.
[250:27.74]You all know what I'm talking about.
[250:28.64]You just refuse to believe it.
[250:36.90]I paused One Piece for this?
[250:38.30]What are you talking about?
[250:46.08]You're watching One Piece and me at the same time?
[250:53.64]I like Rudolph.
[250:54.24]Rudolph hangs out up here and pays his respects to the other dogs.
[250:58.31]What are you doing?
[251:06.62]Look at him.
[251:14.82]Oh.
[251:16.60]Oh, that's so cute.
[251:17.36]You know, I'm telling you, I saw at least a few truths in the chat.
[251:29.62]When you put hard boiled eggs in the fridge and a day or two later you open the container, it stinks.
[251:36.93]I can't wait for you to make hard-boiled eggs, put it in the fridge, and you're gonna take out the container, you're gonna hear what I said in your head, and you're gonna go like this, and one or two seconds is gonna go by, and you're gonna go, fucking piece of shit was right.
[251:58.87]I'm so happy!
[252:01.19]Oh, right, right, right, right.
[252:01.89]Eat these.
[252:02.95]Wings.
[252:04.09]Wings.
[252:09.43]You are literally never right about anything.
[252:13.50]You don't even know what you're talking about.
[252:17.00]You don't even know what you're talking about.
[252:25.26]He is never right.
[252:28.03]I can do this today.
[252:31.47]Listen to this.
[252:32.47]Wow.
[252:33.07]I got a good one here today.
[252:35.95]This is not taking very much effort at all for me to do this, by the way.
[252:40.38]I am just barely, gently, slowly doing this and I'm not even trying.
[252:47.22]Am I really going to be like this for the rest of my life?
[252:55.10]TikTok uncle voice.
[253:00.10]Give me something to say.
[253:00.94]Give me something to say in the TikTok voice.
[253:04.12]Give me something to say.
[253:05.82]What should I say?
[253:06.93]TikTok TTS.
[253:14.78]It's the TikTok voice.
[253:17.65]It's not taking very much to do that.
[253:24.41]Say it's the globalists.
[253:25.85]No.
[253:26.31]The globalists.
[253:30.75]TikTok voice.
[253:31.71]I fucking can't.
[253:36.09]Just got back from Coachella.
[253:38.11]Had an insanely good time.
[253:42.45]Here's some pics from the event.
[253:49.66]Oh, look at all these toys!
[253:55.46]Just got back from Coachella.
[253:57.53]It was absolutely bussin'.
[254:03.39]Ooh.
[254:08.63]You're doing the TikTok of Rocket voice?
[254:17.23]I don't know what's going on with my throat.
[254:18.65]I seriously have no idea.
[254:19.73]Oh, it's time to mutate!
[254:28.54]I was going to scream, but I was like, I don't want to hurt my voice.
[254:43.83]That's actually the worst joke.
[254:47.06]I don't know.
[254:49.46]He's dancing to the music.
[254:51.30]Yeah, I went like this and I was going to scream and I said, I kind of braced my eyes for the scream, but then I was like, MUTE!
[254:56.34]Nah.
[254:57.72]I gave up.
[254:59.59]Didn't want to do that.
[255:00.63]Didn't want to scream really loud into the mic.
[255:12.93]Do Voldemort noises?
[255:19.00]What are we gonna get?
[255:19.50]Come on, Rudolph!
[255:20.10]Give us something cool!
[255:31.71]Cool.
[255:34.03]The red's got, uh, redder.
[255:35.87]The bright's got brighter.
[255:40.58]Cool.
[255:43.09]Got bigger legs?
[255:44.81]No, the tail went down.
[255:45.83]It's alright.
[256:03.54]I love how they rock out to this music.
[256:05.28]It's so cool.
[256:06.63]It's so funny.
[256:07.09]They're just having so much fun.
[256:15.34]Good job.
[256:16.36]That was very good dancing.
[256:17.72]Very, very good.
[256:26.64]Very good job.
[256:27.40]Except you peed your pants.
[256:30.66]What is it?
[256:31.00]What is it, boy?
[256:31.92]What is it?
[256:32.24]Good job.
[256:46.99]Alright, stop shaking around so much.
[256:48.23]I can't see.
[256:51.31]New creature egg?
[256:52.13]Hold on.
[256:55.21]Somebody's hungry.
[256:57.90]I forgot Tubu was still alive.
[256:59.44]I thought Tubu was dead.
[257:00.28]Okay, let's see.
[257:08.68]What do we get?
[257:11.06]How about spud?
[257:12.26]And...
[257:17.57]Courage.
[257:18.19]No.
[257:18.74]We have too much... We're going to end up having Courage be in every single piece of lineage, right?
[257:26.08]Tuba and Spud.
[257:27.18]Let's go.
[257:35.69]Ooh!
[257:36.43]I like this one.
[257:41.69]And this one.
[257:44.09]Mutate them?
[257:48.66]That looks like a cat.
[257:50.34]Let's take this to zero.
[258:04.11]Let's take it to zero.
[258:24.41]Oop.
[258:27.62]We've got a mutation.
[258:28.62]Another mutation.
[258:35.92]Another mutation.
[258:55.17]Oh, yeah.
[258:56.66]Perfect.
[258:58.80]Looks good.
[258:59.30]Let's do it again.
[258:59.76]More.
[259:10.24]More.
[259:13.51]Oh, the pool is kind of shrinking a little.
[259:16.07]It's kind of like Snoopy.
[259:26.45]Okay.
[259:27.41]I think this is it.
[259:30.75]I think it's this one right here.
[259:32.19]Snoopy.
[259:34.17]Worst joke 2022.
[259:35.25]Jerma says Bussin.
[259:52.59]Ooh.
[259:53.35]Alright.
[259:53.67]I think it's this one here in the middle.
[259:57.80]This looks the healthiest.
[259:58.62]That's the one.
[260:03.58]Oh, I said bussin'.
[260:12.01]Were you here the other day when I said... What did I say the other day?
[260:13.89]I said something the other day.
[260:16.29]What was it?
[260:16.63]Oh, yeah.
[260:18.13]I said, like, sheesh.
[260:19.59]I was like, oh, sheesh.
[260:29.82]Hey, you're alright.
[260:37.30]You know, it's funny being older.
[260:40.64]Because I am now not allowed to say those things.
[260:45.29]When I say, okay, let's say the dog were to go like this.
[260:48.85]Whoa, that dog was busting.
[260:50.79]People would be like, shut up, you fucking old loser.
[260:53.63]I'm at the age where I can't do that now.
[260:55.79]Because people yell at me.
[260:58.15]People say, that, don't say that.
[261:02.38]If I were to say, like, bussin', or like, sheesh, or like, aw, dude, no cap, right?
[261:08.96]People would be like, I fucking hate this guy.
[261:12.62]Right?
[261:18.60]Don't even tell me.
[261:21.14]Don't even tell me.
[261:23.06]If I were to, let's try it.
[261:25.79]I want the mods to count the amount of, like, minus twos, ha-has.
[261:32.31]I'm not going to tell you when I'm going to do it.
[261:34.45]I want mods to count it.
[261:36.21]Count how many times people say something negative about it.
[261:39.41]Just watch.
[261:41.28]Just check it out.
[261:41.76]You'll see.
[261:44.60]I'm going to use it in such a great context.
[261:47.22]I'm just going to say it's going to be perfect.
[261:50.48]Where's the egg machine?
[261:54.32]Oh, my goodness.
[261:54.80]I forgot about this guy.
[261:57.76]about like teeny like teeny tiny how about like I like what like teeny I'm not even gonna do it today either I'm gonna I'm gonna hold on to this for like a few days at least tipsy tipsy's fine oh look at little tipsy
[262:37.62]Go in the house, tipsy.
[262:43.80]Are you gonna eat that?
[262:44.52]Okay, fine, eat it.
[262:46.10]I want you to get wings.
[262:46.77]That'd be cool.
[262:50.37]Should've named him Grafted Scion.
[262:52.61]That's pretty good.
[262:57.13]Alright, people, who wants to have fun in here?
[262:58.91]Somebody's not having fun.
[263:00.93]John is not having a good time.
[263:06.66]Why don't you play?
[263:07.29]Yeah, like, go play.
[263:09.39]Oh my god, Spud is, like, suffering again.
[263:14.71]Ah, sweet, I have another devil egg.
[263:30.77]Something healthier, please.
[263:32.43]Like a nutrition pellet.
[263:35.66]Is it me or is Spud always having a problem, right?
[263:40.14]I wonder why.
[263:40.70]Why is Spud just not ever having a good time.
[263:43.84]Ever.
[263:52.58]Spud doesn't like to go to sleep.
[263:54.72]I think that's what's going on.
[263:55.60]Spud doesn't like to go to bed.
[264:00.60]I come up here and Spud is in red.
[264:02.04]For his sleep.
[264:04.57]Every time.
[264:22.92]I looked over at the mod chat that I have in my Discord.
[264:26.40]And I see, LOL, we're not going to do that.
[264:41.19]Alright, well, we don't have... I refuse.
[264:44.55]Okay, alright.
[264:45.29]We don't have to do that.
[264:46.83]We don't have to do that.
[264:51.39]Somebody said there were at least two when you said it.
[264:53.93]Okay, alright.
[264:58.72]Thankfully it's clean.
[265:08.56]Look at... Oh, can he not even eat?
[265:11.02]This was your guy's idea.
[265:19.66]I didn't want to do this.
[265:21.93]This was your idea.
[265:22.81]I didn't want to do this.
[265:23.67]I'm sorry.
[265:23.99]I didn't want to do this.
[265:24.53]You did it.
[265:27.33]I don't think you can even eat food.
[265:29.73]Look what you did.
[265:30.13]I didn't do this.
[265:32.69]I wanted to do it another time.
[265:45.54]Maybe I can feed?
[265:46.94]Can I feed you?
[265:49.90]Go on.
[265:50.18]Eat it.
[265:50.80]Okay.
[265:52.65]Alright.
[265:52.87]No, no, no.
[265:53.15]It was fine.
[265:53.65]I think I just have to tell him to eat.
[265:57.05]What are you doing over here?
[265:58.87]Smush.
[265:59.23]Leave him alone.
[266:11.29]Oh, they're like, he's bumping his nose.
[266:13.84]I think he's trying to make a friend.
[266:30.36]Give Tipsy... Ugh.
[266:33.08]Tipsy's fine.
[266:36.04]That was very nice of you, Smush.
[266:39.30]Tipsy is a baby.
[266:40.60]And you were very gentle.
[266:41.82]And so, that was very good.
[266:42.83]That was very kind of you.
[266:48.17]How's everybody doing?
[266:49.13]Tipsy's okay.
[266:50.51]Tipsy, did you just go to sleep?
[266:54.21]It's Bud.
[266:57.68]Looking for food?
[266:58.18]What do you need?
[266:58.96]What do you need, Bud?
[267:04.34]Sitting over by here.
[267:05.18]How about a dehydrated tree?
[267:06.20]How you doing, okay?
[267:09.39]Well, you have to get out of the way.
[267:10.11]I can't press a button.
[267:14.45]Here.
[267:15.83]Try that.
[267:18.59]Oh, goddammit.
[267:19.25]Whatever.
[267:23.24]Oh, Spud's getting old.
[267:24.40]Okay.
[267:24.94]Spud's getting old.
[267:25.64]Okay, have a snack.
[267:35.31]What the hell was that?
[267:37.73]Okay.
[267:38.89]Tipsy is about to mutate, but I want to feed Tipsy.
[267:41.43]What's, I need something, what's like leg strength?
[267:45.60]What do I feed for leg strength?
[268:01.61]What have you done to Tipsy?
[268:02.63]I didn't do anything.
[268:06.17]You're on the gravity machine?
[268:07.13]Alright, tipsy.
[268:11.41]Let's just pupate.
[268:12.50]We'll just get it over with.
[268:25.88]This game sucks.
[268:26.60]It's so sad.
[268:27.32]What do you mean it's sad?
[268:30.56]Look at this room.
[268:31.32]Look at how these guys have been having a ball up here the whole time.
[268:37.06]Look.
[268:38.54]Is this sad?
[268:39.22]This is great.
[268:40.84]They're having a good time.
[268:41.71]They love to play.
[268:43.61]They're very polite.
[268:45.31]I mean, he's a little rude, but it's okay.
[268:50.31]Food averse?
[268:51.75]That's alright.
[268:56.03]They've just been up here headbanging.
[269:04.46]I'm definitely putting that up here.
[269:09.30]Oh hell yeah.
[269:10.31]Yep.
[269:11.35]That's good shit.
[269:11.93]Alright tipsy, come on.
[269:17.45]You gotta have like stronger legs.
[269:18.39]Alright, front legs got a little thicker.
[269:31.52]Did the body shrink?
[269:41.40]Legs got longer, but... Oh my god.
[269:49.90]Okay.
[270:00.87]I think somebody needs to eat tipsy, I think.
[270:10.25]Alright, you're good to go.
[270:10.85]You've been rocking out this whole time.
[270:12.03]How about like a guava?
[270:13.55]Here, have some food first.
[270:16.09]I think Rudolph might be the best dog we have besides Courage.
[270:22.17]We have to decide who's going to eat Tipsy.
[270:26.13]That's the big issue here.
[270:32.33]I really want wings.
[270:33.13]Alright, I'll try the gravity machine in like the playroom or something like down here.
[270:42.38]Dog stack.
[270:43.66]Gravity machine.
[270:45.34]Oh, this is the new food.
[270:46.32]Right, I wanted to see what was in here.
[270:55.29]Moon?
[271:07.79]Should I put this in a room with Tipsy so Tipsy can like actually move?
[271:14.29]Mars?
[271:18.08]Oh!
[271:21.40]Back to Earth.
[271:23.35]Oh, that looked like it hurt.
[271:42.60]Alright, new food.
[271:43.52]Pancakes.
[271:44.73]Garlic bread, chips, lasagna.
[271:46.39]Alright, lasagna.
[271:47.71]Who wants a lasagna?
[271:50.47]This thing's gotta move.
[271:52.28]I need to... Hold on, my shoulder hurts.
[271:55.06]Okay.
[272:13.09]Alright, let's start serving up some pancakes and shit.
[272:15.05]Alright, look at these new DNA strands.
[272:19.98]I'm just gonna start throwing them down there.
[272:22.58]They'll eat them eventually.
[272:23.30]They'll figure it out.
[272:26.00]Pancakes.
[272:26.68]Garlic bread.
[272:27.30]Food's coming.
[272:39.23]Doritos or something?
[272:41.65]Huh.
[272:49.54]Throw a few lasagnas down there.
[272:56.60]Help her.
[272:59.28]Wait!
[273:09.27]Spud has lived a long life.
[273:10.67]Oh no!
[273:11.13]Spud!
[273:11.53]Oh Spud!
[273:14.31]Spud's dead!
[273:14.97]Oh no!
[273:24.74]It's okay, Spud.
[273:25.89]No, it's alright.
[273:29.13]Where's Courage?
[273:30.05]Courage, you need to eat that.
[273:31.87]Tipsy made it up here.
[273:38.53]No, don't- you don't touch that, too, but get out of here.
[273:41.38]No, Smush, don't touch that!
[273:42.92]Don't- What happened in here?
[273:50.82]I need somebody- I need- where's Courage?
[273:54.16]Courage, come on out.
[273:57.50]End table.
[274:00.14]Large tube.
[274:05.38]It's a piece of tofu.
[274:09.26]Don't eat poop.
[274:13.58]Do I?
[274:14.38]Oh my god.
[274:16.50]No, Rudolph should eat it.
[274:17.59]Rudolph should eat it.
[274:18.19]He's my favorite.
[274:27.38]Alright.
[274:30.18]Your name being Rudolph doesn't really make any sense anymore.
[274:32.98]That's okay though.
[274:40.37]Tuba, get the fuck out of here.
[274:43.07]Tuba's not, you're not supposed to be doing that.
[274:44.67]Eat the pizza and garlic bread and stuff, whatever.
[274:48.79]You eat that, I swear to God.
[274:52.22]Don't touch that.
[274:55.92]Who do I want to eat the orb?
[275:02.38]Do I want Rudolph or do I want courage?
[275:13.71]Give it a tipsy.
[275:19.89]No, I don't need a memorial.
[275:23.51]I'm going to feed it to tipsy.
[275:25.99]Why would I do that?
[275:26.73]That's the fucking dumbest idea we've had all day.
[275:36.18]I don't even know where Tipsy is.
[275:45.40]I'm not feeding.
[275:47.91]Oh no, Smush is old.
[276:23.17]We're going to get tipsy big and strong here.
[276:28.51]Okay.
[276:32.39]I'm looking for leg strength.
[276:36.90]Thick legs.
[276:37.52]Alright.
[276:37.80]We need devil eggs.
[276:41.74]Oh, sweet.
[276:42.68]I have some devil eggs.
[276:53.48]Long body.
[277:04.45]And this increases growth, too.
[277:06.31]This means big.
[277:08.77]Can you eat that tooth, too?
[277:09.73]Maybe I'll eat it.
[277:18.18]Okay.
[277:19.22]Alright.
[277:19.86]I'm ready for Tipsy to do a little evolution here.
[277:25.49]Get some sleep.
[277:27.03]And we'll see if we can get you a little bit stronger.
[277:28.54]Get out of here.
[277:35.14]It's a menace.
[277:42.33]That tube was a menace.
[277:45.47]Kind of funny, but... You know, causes problems a lot, I think.
[277:54.94]You're fine up here.
[277:55.58]Alright, who else is there?
[277:58.52]John, you need to sleep.
[278:04.09]Smush is... Let me play with you for a second.
[278:06.49]Come here.
[278:18.97]I'm drying him off.
[278:20.51]He's covered in water.
[278:24.41]John's getting old.
[278:25.13]Uh oh.
[278:29.78]Oh shit!
[278:30.98]I completely forgot about Snoopy.
[278:39.00]Courage is fine.
[278:42.46]Get the positive reinforcement cap for any property.
[278:48.78]Roto?

[285:15.42]Somebody... Who else died?
[285:16.26]They're on the ground somewhere.
[285:17.18]They're like a box.
[285:21.12]Eat that pizza.
[285:28.38]Eat a pancake?

[286:09.35]Who did this eat?
[286:10.01]What happened?
[286:19.12]Eat the lasagna.
[286:21.50]Where's the other dead body?
[286:28.61]Oh, right here.
[286:49.46]I'm feeding this to Courage.
[286:50.46]I don't want Courage to die.
[287:02.29]We need more deviled eggs?
[287:03.57]Oh.
[287:06.35]Frodo and Tipsy.
[287:07.19]That's the plan.
[287:08.99]Actually, who is this?
[287:12.21]No, no, no, no.
[287:12.97]No one's eaten this.
[287:13.75]I like this one a lot.
[287:15.49]I like this one.
[287:16.07]This is a good one.
[287:18.67]Putting this in the memorial.
[287:19.43]I don't know.
[287:36.84]Stop.
[287:36.94]Stop.
[287:43.00]Yeah, this was Smush.
[287:43.76]I like Smush a lot.
[287:44.58]Smush was really cool.
[287:56.25]Smush, a good dog.
[288:07.04]There.
[288:07.74]A little rowdy, but loved everyone.
[288:14.07]She's a good dog.
[288:14.59]Alright, go to sleep.
[288:23.88]And go to sleep.
[288:24.30]Alright, Rudolph, what do you got?
[288:34.06]Starting to turn almost all golden.
[288:36.76]Is this six legs?
[288:50.00]Okay, I lost a lot of leg gloss, but that's alright.
[288:51.84]Tipsy, I need you to go to sleep.
[288:59.59]Everyone else is fine.
[289:00.37]Where's Tipsy?
[289:04.79]Oh, there you are.
[289:05.19]Okay, get in the house.
[289:13.68]It's late.
[289:14.56]Okay, good.
[289:15.76]Cool.
[289:19.62]You look alright.
[289:20.24]Upgrade the den?
[289:26.68]I don't... I don't... Can I?
[289:32.04]Corn dog.
[289:32.82]Anyone piss on the ground?
[289:38.46]Okay.
[289:45.39]Where's Snoopy?
[289:46.97]Oh, shit.
[289:47.51]You're right.
[289:48.01]Where's Snoopy?
[289:50.95]Alright, there's Snoopy.
[289:55.21]Snoopy.
[289:59.00]I didn't realize Snoopy was this little.
[290:00.14]Uh-oh, Tuba's dead.
[290:07.22]Goodbye, Tuba.
[290:26.44]This actually is really sad.
[290:33.28]Courage is huge.
[290:42.43]Should we memorialize tuba or feed him to courage?
[290:49.01]I don't want, I kind of want courage to stay around.
[290:50.37]Yeah, I want courage to stick around.
[291:05.93]That's good.
[291:15.66]Kind of disgusting over here.
[291:21.28]You monster.
[291:24.42]It's a game mechanic.
[291:25.18]I want some of them to stick around because they have really... He can walk around.
[291:31.02]Are you telling me courage and...
[291:37.65]What are you guys doing?
[291:42.26]Okay.
[291:46.20]I was gonna combine these two, but I don't think that's such a good idea.
[291:51.48]Purge and Proto would be really good.
[291:54.16]God.
[291:54.38]I don't know.
[291:56.83]You know what I mean?
[292:00.23]How you doing, Snoopy?
[292:03.45]You need some food?
[292:08.21]Do it now?
[292:08.91]I don't think I can.
[292:09.95]Uh... Oh, I can!
[292:16.36]I can, I can.
[292:17.06]Perfect.
[292:18.67]Alright, let's go.
[292:19.17]This is it.
[292:20.83]Let's do it.
[292:39.71]We lost the spots.
[292:51.24]Did we?
[292:53.28]It was gone immediately.
[292:53.98]This one kind of looks like a little pig.
[293:46.14]They only have three legs!
[294:05.81]I don't know what to do about this.
[294:06.75]I don't think we can even- we can't even fertilize this.
[294:12.13]We gotta hope for like just a huge mutation here.
[294:25.66]Still three legs?
[294:57.17]Okay.
[295:07.73]Sorry, I realized I was biting my lip.
[295:09.68]And I don't want you to see it.
[295:10.46]Okay.
[295:15.72]Do Proto and Tipsy.
[295:17.16]Tipsy is not old enough.
[295:18.70]I will when Tipsy's old enough.
[295:23.10]Tripod?
[295:27.54]Yeah, Tipsy's not an adult yet.
[295:32.57]Come back.
[295:35.91]Um, do I even... I don't even know if I want to hatch.
[295:39.03]I mean, whatever.
[295:41.05]Tipsy's getting bigger, though.
[295:42.18]Everybody seems to be doing okay.
[295:56.15]Uh, these two are the closest related... Oh my god, I don't know.
[295:59.67]I'm gonna have to... I was gonna stream tomorrow, but maybe I won't.
[296:02.61]Figure out what the fuck is going on here.
[296:11.34]How come they're eating dirt?
[296:16.58]Save the game, yep.
[296:20.60]Give Tipsy a bigger body, please.
[296:23.90]I honestly... I need...
[296:27.13]What does that?
[296:27.69]Okay.
[296:31.57]Let's feed Tipsy a bunch of lasagna.
[296:33.77]Come on, Tipsy, let's go.
[296:38.39]Wrong room.
[296:50.56]Alright, lasagna.
[296:54.70]Have some lasagna.
[297:02.92]Maybe time to end the stream.
[297:03.98]Don't hurt your voice.
[297:04.60]I'll be okay.
[297:08.36]Alright.
[297:09.20]Good.
[297:09.52]Ooh!
[297:10.68]A tooth.
[297:11.06]Teeth make you big too, don't they?
[297:12.32]Yep.
[297:16.05]Alright, good.
[297:16.51]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[297:19.11]Um... Want a pancake?
[297:30.90]Turn this shit off.
[297:38.81]Is it people saying tripod?
[297:41.52]Tripod?
[297:51.84]Tripod sounds good.
[297:52.38]Got a raid?
[297:59.58]Is there?
[297:59.80]I don't see one.
[298:02.53]The dashboard doesn't say anything.
[298:03.43]Tripod is fucked, dude.
[298:09.82]That is fucked.
[298:10.49]Can I rename?
[298:15.73]You gotta sing It's Tomar.
[298:17.29]What's up, Tomar?
[298:18.13]Sorry, my voice is fucked up.
[298:22.79]Snoopy is eating poop.
[298:26.34]It doesn't matter, okay?
[298:27.44]It really doesn't matter.
[298:30.16]What's going on?
[298:31.12]Thanks for stopping by.
[298:35.32]Sing the Tomar theme song.
[298:37.79]I don't know what that is.
[298:40.30]Go to the dog storage.
[298:41.36]You can rename.
[298:42.18]Yeah, that's fucking bad.
[298:43.04]I don't want it to be that.
[298:45.63]That's so awful.
[298:46.57]No, I'm going to name it like Breezy.
[298:52.09]Breezy's better.
[298:56.01]I like Breezy.
[298:56.95]Breezy's fine.
[298:59.87]You called one of your dogs Tipsy.
[299:03.24]Yeah, like teeny like Tipsy.
[299:05.86]I don't know.
[299:06.32]Wait, was that bad?
[299:09.50]Where is Tipsy?
[299:12.48]Um, but I was supposed to be, like, teeny.
[299:14.72]Oh, fuck.
[299:18.72]Alright.
[299:19.44]Come on.
[299:19.88]Let's see what we get here.
[299:23.76]Like, itsy bitsy... Yeah, I don't know.
[299:26.20]I looked over in chat and somebody... That was just rhymed.
[299:36.95]You called the fucked up one tipsy.
[299:39.47]I don't think that's fair because I called...
[299:44.42]What's this one called?
[299:52.10]Eat one of these.
[299:57.99]Worst parent ever.
[299:59.33]It's not copium.
[300:00.23]I'm serious.
[300:02.01]I'm serious.
[300:02.95]It's not copium.
[300:03.77]I'm serious.
[300:04.45]Okay.
[300:05.67]Alright, what do we got?
[300:16.49]Come on, something good.
[300:31.09]And... You can't get any smaller.
[300:40.47]God, dude.
[300:41.55]What the fuck?
[300:43.61]That was evil.
[300:44.53]I didn't even touch that.
[300:45.61]I didn't do anything.
[300:49.71]Tipsy's been eating lasagna all day.
[300:51.57]How is it possible?
[300:52.27]That was at least 15 feet.
[301:07.63]That was at least 15 feet.
[301:15.39]I think we're on the right track.
[301:20.93]That's- I don't like that name.
[301:23.61]I actually don't like that name.
[301:24.72]That name is so fucking awful.
[301:26.52]Something else, something else, something else.
[301:28.90]Uh, where's my storage?
[301:30.04]Something else, something else.
[301:30.92]I don't like that name.
[301:32.44]I don't like that name.
[301:33.22]How do I rename?
[301:47.17]What do you rename?
[301:50.99]Oh.
[301:57.76]Brunch?
[301:58.30]I don't know.
[301:59.46]Brunch.
[302:02.72]There, that's better.
[302:05.31]Brunch.
[302:16.82]I don't know what you're doing.
[302:20.96]I think... I think he's trying to... Are you alright?
[302:39.01]She puked.
[302:51.41]Pretty pumped up about that, by the way.
[302:55.29]Hey, hey.
[303:07.00]Need to breed.
[303:11.42]Snoopy.
[303:11.88]I like the color scheme.
[303:16.25]Not much change.
[303:16.95]It's fine.
[303:17.35]Okay, so can I?
[303:18.27]Let's see.
[303:19.81]Tipsy's not old enough.
[303:21.79]Can't happen.
[303:22.69]One more mutation.
[303:23.31]Oh, and when did the dog stop fighting?
[303:28.93]Um, there's been a few fights already.
[303:30.19]I had to break up a couple of them.
[303:33.14]One of them was really bad.
[303:37.08]One just wouldn't let go.
[303:37.92]It was, like, kind of fucked up.
[303:39.20]Okay, just checking to see if something pisses.
[303:54.98]My brunch is ready to mutate.
[303:56.02]Okay.
[304:12.93]Anybody hungry or anything?
[304:13.82]Snoopy's tired.
[304:20.24]Oops, I'm sorry.
[304:21.62]Come over here and sleep.
[304:22.36]You don't... You can... Come here.
[304:23.74]It's okay.
[304:24.06]Come here.
[304:27.58]Stay in the corner.
[304:28.24]The courage is a big dog.
[304:29.72]Be careful.
[304:30.12]Okay.
[304:43.13]Not much of a change.
[304:43.91]I don't think they ate very much.
[304:46.25]No, they didn't.
[304:53.06]Eat some more lasagna.
[304:54.40]Here.
[304:56.46]Lasagna makes you big.
[305:02.84]Oh, Tipsy.
[305:03.32]I'm so sorry.
[305:03.78]You need help.
[305:04.24]Okay.
[305:04.74]Tipsy needs to eat.
[305:09.35]I don't know.
[305:10.35]I keep trying to feed Tipsy stuff, but it doesn't work.
[305:14.07]Deviled eggs, right?
[305:14.70]A couple deviled eggs.
[305:32.46]Alright, let's relax for a second and you should go to sleep.
[305:38.10]French fries?
[305:38.56]Alright, alright, alright.
[305:51.16]Tipsy's sleeping.
[305:52.74]I'm gonna leave Tipsy alone.
[305:59.25]Eat this coconut.
[306:04.71]That's dirt.
[306:05.15]Okay, well, whatever.
[306:06.77]He's delayed it.
[306:11.93]How come Tipsy's built like that?
[306:13.05]Um, it's because we were doing some experiments.
[306:17.52]I kind of just ended up that way.
[306:19.58]Hello, Brunch.
[306:27.37]Are you okay?
[306:31.17]You looking to play?
[306:31.95]Here, play with the ball.
[306:35.66]Throw it.
[306:36.14]Throw that ball.
[306:39.28]Oh, jump on it.
[306:39.86]Throw it.
[306:44.78]Come on.
[306:48.44]Go get it.
[306:51.06]You have too many legs.
[306:52.17]Nobody can... This whole time, no one's been able to do anything.
[306:57.99]They have too many legs.
[306:59.19]They can't even run.
[306:59.95]Is that...
[307:09.50]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[307:11.48]I'm trying to move him over to the ball.
[307:13.96]Come here.
[307:21.60]Okay, get it.
[307:22.28]Okay, I have a coconut.
[307:37.99]Oh, shit.
[307:38.51]Cool.
[307:42.32]Play dead.
[307:45.54]New trick.
[307:46.66]Nice trick.
[307:48.06]Very good job.
[307:48.90]Good, good, good.
[307:49.68]Good trick.
[307:53.11]What are you doing over there?
[307:54.07]Playing with some dirt?
[307:55.95]That's funny.
[307:59.21]That's funny.
[307:59.71]Good for you.
[308:03.94]Uh, throw it.
[308:04.54]I don't know what you're throwing.
[308:09.46]Okay.
[308:19.71]I don't know what you're... I don't know what's... Okay, I think he's spelling sleep.
[308:26.23]He's sleeping standing up.
[308:38.89]I don't have any den upgrades.
[308:45.82]Courage is hungry.
[308:49.97]I need to at least level up tipsy.
[308:57.92]French fries.
[308:58.40]Yeah, have another french fry.
[309:00.68]Come on, you can get it.
[309:05.95]There you go.
[309:07.15]There you go.
[309:10.19]You can do it.
[309:10.59]Ooh.
[309:15.51]There's progress here.
[309:16.41]I think we just need the legs to be spread out more.
[309:18.95]I need body length.
[309:21.03]French fries should do it.
[309:21.93]I hope.
[309:24.07]I hope so.
[309:29.84]Just with a little bit of increased body.
[309:31.24]They can move around.
[309:34.54]Okay.
[309:37.98]Good.
[309:40.80]Alright.
[309:41.16]Courage you need.
[309:41.88]Eat something.
[309:44.86]Have one of these.
[309:47.05]Here, eat that.
[309:50.99]That was it, really?
[309:51.79]How about a, um, have a, have a chicken.
[309:53.69]Oh, no, a corn dog.
[309:54.43]Yeah, that's a new, uh, thing.
[309:55.55]Here.
[309:55.73]Try that.
[310:03.28]Oh, shit.
[310:03.72]Right, Rudolph.
[310:10.14]Interesting.
[310:11.86]Much bigger head.
[310:15.38]Back length.
[310:16.92]Back leg width.
[310:19.74]A lot of growth.
[310:20.34]Bigger legs.
[310:24.42]That's probably better.
[310:24.92]That's probably helps.
[310:26.30]Alright, I have one of these.
[310:29.63]I have one of those chips.
[310:34.65]And the nose is getting red again.
[310:35.69]Yeah, that looks cool.
[310:37.47]I'm supposed to eat a cocoon.
[310:45.60]How close are you two evolving?
[310:49.82]Have some corn.
[310:51.96]You like corn?
[310:58.60]Seen but often not heard.
[311:00.16]I think we're going to get a good evolution here with Tipsy.
[311:13.47]Come over here.
[311:13.99]Come downstairs.
[311:18.11]I want you to participate.
[311:18.97]I don't want you to just be up here by yourself.
[311:20.25]Come on.
[311:20.49]Come up here.
[311:22.71]I want you to participate.
[311:23.95]Come have fun.
[311:27.21]Let's, like, put on some music.
[311:28.11]Let's get some tunes on.
[311:32.54]And have everybody come over here and hang out.
[311:39.26]Why are you biting his tail?
[311:42.66]Don't bite his tail!
[311:44.08]There we go!
[311:53.53]Look!
[311:56.23]This is- alright, good, good, here comes the evolution.
[312:00.53]Okay, come on.
[312:04.02]See if we can- the body just needs to lengthen and that's probably fine.
[312:07.62]I don't want Tipsy to be up there by herself, no.
[312:10.16]What are you doing?
[312:16.46]Jungle carpet?
[312:25.87]that's a screenshot if I've ever seen it it's so cute alright come on what we got I think that's better yup front top leg body girth body length has increased
[312:57.82]Okay, it's increased by a little bit.
[313:01.48]By 3.2%.
[313:05.16]Slim down.
[313:05.70]Okay.
[313:14.43]Alright, that actually looks better.
[313:16.35]That actually looks a lot better.
[313:18.71]I think one more evolution with a little bit of length and... She lost a leg?
[313:31.65]No, she didn't.
[313:35.10]Proto, what are you up to?
[313:37.38]Alright, now we can do this.
[313:38.18]We can breed, yeah.
[313:42.88]Tipsy and Proto.
[313:45.10]Okay, here we go.
[313:45.50]Let's do it.
[313:45.94]Let's see it.
[313:46.48]This is it.
[313:46.70]This is the big one.
[313:49.90]Got spots.
[314:06.93]Oh wow!
[314:08.46]Oh wow.
[314:09.98]Wow!
[314:10.38]Okay.
[314:14.20]This one has hearts all over it.
[314:19.92]There are two candidates here.
[314:23.18]I wonder if I should keep going.
[314:25.48]Or just grab the one with the hearts.
[314:26.80]Yeah, let's do it.
[314:33.87]Very cool.
[314:36.47]I could do this again, too.
[314:52.31]I want to do... No, no.
[314:56.09]Proto and Rudolph.
[314:59.21]I want some more spots.
[315:04.96]Hey, that's kind of cool.
[315:05.78]Anybody have spots?
[315:08.50]You do.
[315:11.69]And you do.
[315:18.17]Very cool.
[315:18.71]Alright.
[315:20.53]The hearts again.
[315:21.13]And another variation.
[315:42.48]Very cool.
[315:46.29]New tail?
[315:47.49]Wait, there was a new tail?
[315:50.03]That is a new tail, isn't it?
[316:09.58]I don't want to go much further here.
[316:10.54]I think this is perfect.
[316:13.61]food from this litter though probably you over this one new pattern oh shit there is a new pattern alright we're taking this one alright this I'll take this next one to zero oh I don't have another egg do I
[316:43.72]I'm gonna have to store some people.
[316:49.12]What do I store?
[316:49.76]I don't know.
[316:55.66]Who should I store?
[316:56.50]I'm gonna have way too many people.
[317:04.38]It's the one with hearts.
[317:13.66]Oh, I like Valentine.
[317:16.96]Valentine's a good one.
[317:21.98]I'm going to store Rudolph.
[317:23.06]That's a good idea.
[317:27.82]Maybe store Rudolph and... Maybe Proto?
[317:41.89]That's a good idea.
[317:44.40]Okay.
[317:46.92]I gotta clean up a little bit for a second.
[317:48.30]Hold on.
[317:59.17]Mess.
[317:59.37]I'll leave a little garden down here.
[318:08.41]That's fine.
[318:10.34]None of this other bullshit.
[318:25.75]You're ready to mutate already?
[318:27.09]Okay.
[318:27.35]Alright, this is... How do I name this dog?
[318:40.88]How about like... Oh, Mecha Run.
[318:43.26]That's a good one.
[318:46.90]Sponge?
[318:51.60]Sweetie?
[318:53.28]Sweetie's not bad.
[318:55.86]Jason how about spongy where's tipsy oh right there okay tipsy's asleep her just digging more oh keep doing that very good job
[319:25.95]Alright, Tipsy, go to bed over here.
[319:32.56]I gotta do some decorating.
[319:41.22]I don't even have to upgrade the den.
[319:42.26]You're doing it for me.
[319:44.32]Okay.
[319:57.24]Come on.
[320:02.05]Jesus.
[320:10.08]Taken forever.
[320:11.06]Holy shit.
[320:13.82]Check achievements.
[320:16.06]Hold on a sec.
[320:19.04]Okay.
[320:19.24]34% taller.
[320:30.26]Wasn't that tall to begin with, but I guess it's a little bit bigger.
[320:36.61]I've been playing for five hours.
[320:41.92]Okay, hold on a second.
[320:42.94]This is where it gets weird.
[321:00.72]Oh, shit.
[321:01.56]Okay.
[321:02.32]Um... I have to redo this whole thing.
[321:14.91]Oh, do... Oh, no, I don't.
[321:18.15]They don't all have to be connected to each other.
[322:39.68]Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[322:40.32]I got so many more rooms.
[322:51.61]I need some planning.
[322:52.93]I need to plan this better.
[322:53.87]This is the starting room, which is gonna have... It's very basic.
[323:00.17]I like the clouds.
[323:01.67]Clouds are fine.
[323:07.89]That's enough.
[323:09.83]not bad alright I like that oh I gotta figure out what okay this is the memorial I can stay that way one of my this is the food room let's have two food rooms okay all the all the food has to be in like one spot
[324:15.78]What the?
[324:16.14]I can make them small?
[324:21.28]Why didn't I do this in the first place?
[324:22.83]I didn't know I could make them that small.
[324:37.11]This is pretty huge.
[324:43.91]Perfect.
[324:44.27]Okay, cool.
[324:44.93]Very cool.
[324:48.47]now this room's kind of ugly I don't really like the carpet that much it's hard to even see the food on the floor or like a cafeteria that sounds better to me pull this room down a little
[325:18.19]Okay, no, I don't need that.
[325:19.51]It looks good.
[325:19.97]Alright, that's the food room.
[325:22.21]So then all other food, get rid of it.
[325:23.93]I don't want this anymore.
[325:27.23]Put the couch over here, somewhere like right here.
[325:37.04]The memorials will go here.
[325:38.02]I'll probably have a few of those in a minute.
[325:44.92]What is this place?
[325:47.03]This is the toy room.
[325:47.67]Okay, the toy room is fine.
[325:48.63]We'll just get rid of this.
[325:49.29]Okay, this is the play room, so it's going to stay like this.
[326:03.46]This is okay.
[326:06.80]There's no food.
[326:07.48]It's just too much food.
[326:08.58]Well, they'll go get the food down there.
[326:14.07]Playroom, sleep room, memorial, cafeteria.
[326:18.84]What should this be?
[326:24.80]What should this be?
[326:28.28]Is a tree in the way?
[326:31.24]Make this the anti-gravity room.
[326:38.03]Okay.
[326:38.91]No, I don't want to do that.
[326:40.27]That sounds horrible.
[326:41.79]Make it space, because it's an anti-gravity room.
[326:49.64]Okay, fine.
[326:53.08]And then this will be the garden.
[326:56.14]This is the garden.
[326:58.52]Perfect.
[327:03.85]Perfect.
[327:04.83]Alright.
[327:06.89]Switch the food in the memorial room.
[327:11.29]That's a good point.
[327:13.65]That's a good point.
[327:14.43]Yeah, that's a good point.
[327:15.09]So I don't have to go as far.
[327:16.97]Good point.
[327:38.51]Did I?
[327:40.49]Those are still exist, right?
[327:45.74]Oh, I could.
[327:48.20]Right.
[327:56.36]Right.
[328:07.78]I'm playing chess while the game's playing checkers.
[328:09.72]Like, what the fuck am I doing?
[328:13.70]Do those still exist?
[328:19.67]The memorials exist, right?
[328:20.85]They're not gone, are they?
[328:24.31]They better be.
[328:25.57]I think they're still there.
[328:26.23]Alright, people are hungry.
[328:29.95]Alright, come on, come on, come on.
[328:31.17]No, no, no, there's nothing there.
[328:32.03]Alright, hold on.
[328:52.72]Arm is killing me.
[328:53.98]Why am I so fucked up today?
[328:55.02]I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.
[328:56.52]Okay, that's fine.
[329:14.59]He's falling apart.
[329:22.74]Get nice and cool in here.
[329:23.58]Okay.
[329:23.99]Alright.
[329:24.49]Now they can eat.
[329:25.17]They can get food.
[329:25.83]And now let's put the memorial stuff down here.
[329:30.64]Okay.
[329:30.92]Yeah.
[329:31.66]Thank goodness.
[329:46.42]Sag.
[329:46.82]I don't know.
[329:48.35]Maybe I am getting sick.
[329:50.23]I don't think I am.
[329:51.21]That'd be kind of annoying if I was.
[329:53.33]Okay.
[329:59.68]Let me clean this up.
[330:09.62]Get a tree in here.
[330:14.54]This dude's farming sadges.
[330:16.52]Oh, I don't think I feel good.
[330:19.54]Um, I don't feel good.
[330:20.86]Hmm?
[330:26.54]The dogs are starving, you're right.
[330:27.56]Oh my god.
[330:28.54]Alright, food, food, food, food, food.
[330:33.86]Food, food, food.
[330:35.42]Everyone's starving.
[330:37.97]Oh!
[330:39.65]Oh my god!
[330:40.23]Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.
[330:45.46]Tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy.
[330:48.02]What do you want?
[330:48.36]What do you want?
[330:48.70]Lasagna, lasagna, lasagna, lasagna.
[330:55.64]Right there, right there.
[330:56.24]It's eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[330:57.58]Okay.
[331:03.26]I forgot the game doesn't pause.
[331:04.72]Okay.
[331:05.34]Cause I've, it's.
[331:09.08]You're okay.
[331:09.68]Okay.
[331:09.88]Back.
[331:10.04]You can go back to sleep.
[331:13.65]Very good.
[331:27.05]They've got corndogs in the corner here!
[331:28.81]They're fine!
[331:29.37]They've got- seriously, they've got corndogs.
[332:04.03]This is taking much more effort.
[332:05.83]Okay, cool.
[332:13.06]Here we go.
[332:13.40]I think brunch grew a lot.
[332:26.35]A little base now?
[332:29.89]Snout rotation minus 30%.
[332:31.09]Courage is dying?
[332:34.77]That don't look like dying to me.
[332:40.31]That looks like having a great time.
[332:43.61]I have corndog.
[332:55.32]Dying.
[332:55.78]That's not dying.
[333:31.82]Coke got a lot darker.
[333:33.44]Interesting.
[333:33.88]17% taller.
[333:37.60]Very cool.
[333:40.94]Put courage in storage so they don't die.
[333:48.53]Pattern metallic plus 20%.
[333:55.03]What's that mean?
[333:57.99]It's shinier?
[333:59.57]What does metallic pattern mean?
[334:07.37]This motivated me to sit with my dog.
[334:09.47]Oh, that's cute.
[334:20.38]Tipsy, you wanna play?
[334:20.96]Good throw.
[334:30.09]Good throw.
[334:30.53]Nice job.
[334:35.09]Okay, french fries for Tipsy, right?
[335:01.84]A little bit more body length and we'll be fine.
[335:03.72]What the fuck is going on?
[335:10.97]I... Alright, you need to go to sleep.
[335:19.59]Somewhere comfortable in the corner so you don't... I don't want you to get beat up or anything.
[335:22.78]In front of the AC?
[335:25.88]Yeah, right here.
[335:28.62]There you go, get some sleep.
[335:31.66]It's okay.
[335:32.04]It's alright.
[335:32.42]Right in front of the AC.
[335:33.50]Nice and cool.
[335:39.44]I love Tipsy.
[335:40.24]Tipsy's amazing.
[335:47.98]Urge is ancient.
[335:50.12]Maybe it is time to store courage.
[335:53.26]Yeah, I'll do it.
[335:53.72]I don't want to lose him.
[336:04.91]Make a wind vortex?
[336:05.99]Oh, I was gonna make the, uh... Okay, everyone seems to be okay now.
[336:09.49]This is the anti-gravity room, right?
[336:12.58]Yeah.
[336:31.22]Mars?
[336:31.56]Or should I just do anti-gravity?
[336:36.94]Does that work?
[336:46.38]Is this fun?
[336:46.86]Do they think this is fun?
[336:52.58]I think they're having a good time.
[337:02.61]Send... Tipsy's hanging out, having a good time.
[337:06.09]No.
[337:14.14]Another French fry and I think we'll have enough length for Tipsy to be able to really just kind of move around.
[337:21.34]I think she'll be fine.
[337:24.45]Come here, Tipsy.
[337:24.83]Have one of these.
[337:25.21]There you go.
[337:37.98]The food in this game is making me hungry.
[337:40.16]I'm getting hungry too.
[337:40.98]What time is it?
[337:44.66]End of the stream, boys.
[337:45.52]Coming up here in a minute.
[337:47.00]I'm going to get some food, and I'm going to try to figure out what the hell's going on in here.
[337:53.28]It's way strong.
[337:53.96]Alright.
[337:54.36]Way stronger than, like, an hour ago.
[338:00.21]Like I said, 5% to 10% more body length, and I think it's perfect.
[338:03.29]I think it's going to be fine.
[338:05.91]It's not my sinuses.
[338:06.77]It's, like, back, like, here.
[338:08.71]Like, in here.
[338:09.81]It's really weird.
[338:12.74]Sorry about that.
[338:13.43]I didn't think I was going to be like a fucking chain smoker today.
[338:16.81]Is it my tonsils?
[338:21.69]It's like deeper.
[338:22.19]It's like down here.
[338:23.41]Like in here.
[338:32.21]Take a nap over here maybe?
[338:37.74]Yeah, this is a lot more walking than Tipsy's done.
[338:40.20]I'm actually happy about this.
[338:46.86]That body length was really bad before, but now... Oh, there we go.
[338:49.74]Hell yeah.
[338:51.16]Yes!
[338:52.54]Yes!
[338:54.70]Yes!
[339:03.31]Play with the ball.
[339:10.13]Spongy, play with the ball.
[339:10.87]Why are you not playing with the ball?
[339:16.60]Good throw!
[339:17.30]That was a great throw.
[339:25.23]Wait, that's the anti-gravity chamber?
[339:26.95]Oh, no it's not.
[339:32.25]Where did Tipsy go?
[339:37.65]Where's Tipsy?
[339:39.77]Oh, there we go.
[339:42.05]Look at how happy Tipsy is being able to move around!
[339:47.96]This is great.
[339:50.17]Actually, what a great development.
[339:53.75]Look at that!
[339:59.67]Yes!
[340:00.73]That actually makes me really happy.
[340:01.89]I'm glad.
[340:05.08]Alright.
[340:05.98]Be careful.
[340:14.26]Look, they're having fun!
[340:15.26]Yes!
[340:21.70]We've got a good ending.
[340:23.79]I'm curious with another evolution, though.
[340:30.13]This is a fun game.
[340:30.77]This is a cute game.
[340:32.05]How much is this game?
[340:35.54]This is really fun.
[340:36.30]This is just, like, chill.
[340:37.28]I loved it.
[340:40.70]It's 20 bucks.
[340:41.46]Yeah.
[340:42.86]This is really cute.
[340:49.31]Oh, look it!
[340:52.44]Go!
[340:52.66]Go!
[340:52.86]Go!
[340:53.28]Go!
[340:53.70]Go!
[340:54.12]Go!
[340:54.54]Go!
[340:54.74]They're both doing so well.
[340:59.58]Yeah!
[341:02.28]Perfect.
[341:09.63]Alright.
[341:10.31]Okay.
[341:10.67]Ready to relax.
[341:11.31]No more music.
[341:11.91]Let's get some food.
[341:15.51]Snoopy, I don't know.
[341:16.17]I think you're like stuck in here.
[341:20.35]Snoopy, be careful.
[341:21.33]I wouldn't go in that room.
[341:25.95]Okay, you're fine.
[341:26.53]Is there any food?
[341:29.77]Alright, there's a pizza bagel over here.
[341:31.09]You can eat that.
[341:33.09]Eat this pizza bagel.
[341:33.93]There you go.
[341:45.18]Okay, you need to go this way to get some food.
[342:02.51]Alright, snack time.
[342:03.27]How about a moon cheese?
[342:06.41]That sounds good.
[342:17.32]What else is hungry?
[342:18.10]You?
[342:18.44]Alright, what do you like?
[342:19.08]What are you looking for?
[342:20.00]How about a lasagna?
[342:22.44]Oh, you want a candy apple?
[342:23.32]Okay, sure.
[342:23.94]Take it.
[342:26.38]That's what I wanted.
[342:26.96]I'm
[342:32.87]Alright.
[342:33.63]Alright, I think that's it.
[342:35.27]I think that's it.
[342:38.13]Do one more evolution.
[342:43.15]Tipsy and Brunch.
[342:43.99]I don't think Brunch is old enough.
[342:47.43]Brunch is not old enough.
[342:48.61]Not yet.
[342:53.49]One more.
[342:53.85]Alright, we'll do Brunch and Tipsy.
[342:56.39]I'll do that before I go.
[343:01.93]The next stream, we're going to do Mon Bazo, which is like a car game.
[343:07.55]It's kind of like My Summer Car and Long Drive combined.
[343:12.84]I can't tell you we're doing that tomorrow, though, because I think I'm going to take a day to figure out what's going on here.
[343:18.42]Yeah, it's a car game.
[343:22.71]Come here.
[343:30.80]I might be sick.
[343:31.30]Well, if I'm sick, then I'm sick.
[343:32.76]Whatever.
[343:33.06]I'll figure it out.
[343:38.53]I'll figure it out.
[343:43.19]I don't think that's the case.
[343:44.67]I think it's like some kind of environmental change or something.
[343:46.65]I don't know.
[343:46.93]I gotta... See what happens tomorrow.
[343:52.14]Ooh, a picket fence.
[343:54.56]Everyone just hanging out in here?
[343:58.92]Uh, Tipsy needs food.
[343:59.86]I'll bring something.
[344:01.12]What is Tipsy's favorite food?
[344:02.32]Because I'm going to bring it.
[344:06.96]It's definitely, like, a pancake or something.
[344:22.56]Oh, shit.
[344:23.03]They dug some more.
[344:23.69]Cool.
[344:26.34]Alright, Tipsy, come on up.
[344:27.94]I didn't want to do that.
[344:28.70]I'm sorry.
[344:29.91]How do I get you to come out?
[344:35.95]No, fuck!
[344:43.87]I didn't... I didn't mean to do that.
[344:47.59]Oh, here we go.
[344:48.00]Here we go.
[344:48.74]This is... We have some mutations here.
[345:14.88]Okay.
[345:18.12]I need Tipsy to come out.
[345:19.08]Tipsy, can you come out, please?
[345:23.30]Come on out.
[345:32.49]Oh my god.
[345:33.53]I need a lasagna instead.
[345:43.24]There you go.
[345:47.03]Good.
[345:47.31]Stop.
[345:47.63]Oh god.
[346:16.33]Eat this pancake.
[346:28.13]Can you not eat the pancake?
[346:29.21]Get out of the zero gravity room!
[346:51.08]okay now you need to go to sleep right now very cool let's see what we got do the voice before your throat explodes what voice
[347:19.42]Head got a little bigger.
[347:20.18]Probably good for balance.
[347:22.52]That's good.
[347:29.40]Ooh.
[347:30.86]Cool.
[347:31.12]Did the spots change?
[347:39.25]The spots look different.
[347:41.99]TikTok voice.
[347:45.69]You want me to do the TikTok voice again?
[347:58.07]Do the Coachella voice.
[348:03.07]That's cool.
[348:07.95]Is that good for your throat, though?
[348:10.61]Um... It's kind of like going in and out, if you noticed.
[348:14.22]It's like sometimes it's like... And then sometimes it's like... Arts, okay.
[348:22.89]Bigger head.
[348:25.33]And more metallic.
[348:26.29]I don't notice the metallic, though.
[348:34.94]Tipsy's body got short again?
[348:36.44]What?
[348:43.38]Oh no, it did.
[348:44.28]What happened?
[348:45.98]What happened?
[348:46.70]What happened?
[348:49.63]What the heck?
[348:51.17]What the f- Really?
[349:04.43]Uh, Tipsy and... Not Snoopy.
[349:06.89]Who was it?
[349:09.04]Who was it?
[349:09.92]No, who was it?
[349:12.14]Oh, they're not old enough.
[349:12.82]They're not old enough yet.
[349:20.39]It wasn't... No, it wasn't Proto.
[349:21.61]It was one of the spots.
[349:22.77]It was one of these.
[349:23.25]It was Brunch.
[349:26.25]Not old enough.
[349:33.01]Oh no, Tipsy's a wedge again.
[349:34.47]What's going on with the nose?
[349:49.23]Did Tipsy's head get bigger?
[349:50.57]I think Tipsy's head is bigger.
[350:06.78]Okay, alright.
[350:09.50]I'm gonna save it here in case I play it again.
[350:11.86]That was fun.
[350:12.70]That was really cute.
[350:13.32]I was a big fan.
[350:16.78]This is how... I'm definitely gonna save this because I don't know, I might play it again.
[350:29.46]Although I say that about everything.
[350:34.84]I did not think I was going to play this for six hours, but that was really cool.
[350:39.26]I'm supposed to stream tomorrow, but... I... I don't know.
[350:43.64]I might not.
[350:45.34]So, tentatively... I would just say prepare for... Today's Tuesday.
[350:50.98]I just prepare for... Prepare for Thursday?
[350:57.12]And if tomorrow I get up and I'm fine, I'll just go tomorrow.
[351:00.57]But if not, then we'll go on Thursday.
[351:03.35]So just plan for Thursday, but don't be surprised if you see me tomorrow.
[351:11.34]This is really fun.
[351:11.94]This is a really cool game.
[351:19.62]I hope I'm not getting sick.
[351:20.94]I really hope not.
[351:23.15]So I'll see you Friday.
[351:23.95]So see you Saturday.
[351:24.73]No, that... I don't know yet.
[351:26.73]I don't know yet.
[351:29.51]Can we get a fit check?
[351:32.54]Checking out my Coachella fit check.
[351:37.52]What do you guys think?
[351:39.44]I think it's at least... At least a 5 out of 5.
[351:50.43]Stay healthy?
[351:51.41]I am.
[351:51.71]Don't worry.
[351:52.01]I'll be okay.
[351:54.43]Please stop that.
[351:57.17]See you in July.
[351:58.83]No, I will see you in July.
[352:00.08]You're right, because July 14th.
[352:02.50]Make sure you check out on July 14th.
[352:05.14]July 14th is going to be the baseball stream.
[352:08.14]You're not going to want to miss it.
[352:09.74]Trust me on that.
[352:10.60]It's going to have all kinds of festivities, all kinds of cool stuff.
[352:15.87]You're not going to want to miss it.
[352:17.69]Trust me.
[352:21.55]And I'm telling you, take a burrito, put cheese on top of it, and wrap it in another burrito.
[352:28.39]Boston.
[352:35.26]See you later.
[352:40.46]Oh, what's that?
[352:41.20]Oh, how many minus twos do I see?
[352:43.70]Huh?
[352:45.28]Oh, hold on a minute there.
[352:46.33]I can't really see that well.
[352:57.54]Yeah, I'll play it for Thursday.
[352:59.08]I'll see you maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
[353:01.60]Alright.
[353:04.57]Good night, guys.
[353:04.95]It's been fun.
[353:06.69]This game is actually really cool.
[353:07.71]I recommend it.
[353:08.73]If you haven't played it, I recommend it.
[353:09.91]Go check it out.
[353:14.02]Mine is too quiet, old man.
[353:15.40]I feel like I'm playing Sekiro again.
[353:19.50]Remember Sekiro?
[353:21.87]If you go watch the Sekiro VODs, like, the whole time I was playing Sekiro, I sounded like this.
[353:26.78]Actually, way worse than this.
[353:27.78]Like, 100 times worse.
[353:31.58]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[353:41.40]It's been a long time since I've been, like, quote, sick on stream.
[353:44.71]It's been a very long time.
[353:48.97]It's been at least...
[353:52.01]I think that's the last time that happened.
[354:00.99]I hate getting sick.
[354:01.87]I hate it.
[354:02.68]I hope it's not happening.
[354:03.52]I gotta stop yelling.
[354:04.32]No more yelling.
[354:05.54]I hope your TikTok voice doesn't get worse.
[354:09.82]Thanks for the stream.
[354:10.70]Yeah, thanks for watching.
[354:12.62]Take care of yourselves.
[354:15.15]Have a good rest of your kind of midweek here.
[354:23.49]Has it gotten worse or has it been about exactly the same since the stream started?
[354:26.51]It's kind of hard to tell.
[354:27.67]I feel like it's kind of going in and out.
[354:32.41]I feel like it's fine, but not.
[354:34.37]Is it worse?
[354:34.77]Yeah, well.
[354:49.38]I'll shut up.
[354:53.78]I will shut up.
[355:00.82]Drink some water?
[355:01.40]I'll drink some water.
[355:07.47]You need to keep talking.
[355:08.69]Alright, let's do a raid.
[355:18.37]Let's raid.
[355:19.39]Let's see.
[355:23.62]Let's raid, let's raid Atriok.
[355:25.84]It's Atriok's birthday today.
[355:27.82]I just figured that out right now because I saw it right here.
[355:31.24]Happy birthday to Atriok.
[355:34.53]It's Atriok's birthday.
[355:35.65]I want you to go say happy birthday.
[355:39.37]I'm gonna be fucking pissed.
[355:48.98]Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[355:50.34]Goodbye.
