[00:47.35]Oh, it's already messed up.
[00:49.83]I can't even start the stream.
[00:51.39]Are you kidding me?
[00:53.41]Oh, boy.
[00:54.25]Alright.
[00:54.95]I gotta... Hold on.
[00:55.47]Where's my phone?
[00:56.79]Where's my phone?
[01:04.49]It's already happening.
[01:06.85]Already.
[01:08.94]Hold on.
[01:09.16]I'll be right back.
[01:44.32]I have a specific phone number that I have to call right now.
[01:47.74]Hold on.
[01:48.18]Give me a second.
[01:52.64]They're monitoring my connection right now.
[01:55.42]So they're going to see this.
[01:57.12]They're going to see it.
[02:27.06]Alright, let's see.
[02:30.14]We couldn't even start the stream?
[02:32.80]That's a first.
[02:40.33]I can't even start the stream.
[02:43.27]My goodness.
[02:46.44]Well... Hey, thanks for coming to the stream, guys.
[02:53.79]I'm glad we could do a 10-second stream.
[06:00.85]Hey.
[06:01.01]I just, like, come out of nowhere.
[06:05.02]Hey.
[06:05.26]Yeah, give me a minute.
[06:08.18]I just want to make sure that this stays on.
[06:12.08]You know, because it could turn off at any second, so.
[06:14.14]All right, give me one more minute.
[07:37.97]Okay, hi.
[07:40.85]We're back for real.
[07:42.07]It looks like it's going to stay.
[07:42.93]All you can hear is crickets in the background.
[07:49.67]You guys ready for the cricket stream?
[07:52.15]It's happening right now.
[07:54.85]We're just going to stream the starting soon.
[07:57.59]And only crickets.
[07:58.35]That's all you're going to get.
[08:03.08]Thanks for coming.
[08:03.96]See you later.
[08:05.16]It was fun.
[08:08.06]It's funny, hold on.
[08:08.64]Can you hear the double crickets?
[08:10.96]There's crickets in the game, and there's crickets outside this window that's open.
[08:15.04]There's double cricket action going on right now.
[08:19.06]And right when I say that, they all shut up outside.
[08:21.08]They must have been listening.
[08:23.26]Alright.
[08:24.18]Let's close this window.
[08:25.40]I don't want two crickets chirping in my fucking ear.
[08:28.08]Give me a second.
[08:31.66]Alright.
[08:34.46]We're going to do sorcery again until the stream goes down.
[08:38.80]Inevitably, whenever that happens, it's probably in two hours, maybe.
[08:42.70]Or, it might.
[08:45.18]It might be gone forever.
[08:46.48]The problem might be solved by tomorrow.
[08:49.02]I've been going back and forth with this Comcast tech.
[08:53.02]He's been on it.
[08:53.86]He's been really working on it.
[08:56.57]It's stable for now.
[09:00.35]Let's see.
[09:00.67]I don't even know where the hell we were.
[09:05.85]The last thing I remember doing is killing one of the serpents.
[09:11.17]Those crickets mean it's story time?
[09:14.22]Those crickets mean we're going to kill the water serpent, because I think that's the last place we stopped.
[09:23.20]Stable for now.
[09:28.15]Let me get my dog in here and we can just get going.
[09:32.31]One more second, I promise.
[10:17.92]Alright, let's go.
[10:20.46]I'm gonna go eat.
[10:23.54]Alright, let's get into the swing of things here.
[10:25.11]The last thing we did, let's look at our fucking notes.
[10:32.61]Music.
[10:32.93]I forgot how loud this music goes.
[10:34.39]Alright, clues.
[10:37.29]Oh, hey, clues!
[10:41.91]Snattercats are invisible.
[10:44.38]Did you know that?
[10:45.10]Did you know that Snattercats aren't visible?
[10:49.44]Whatever.
[10:49.92]Let's just fucking walk in a direction.
[10:55.77]Oh, we have some bits coming in here.
[10:58.61]Many a life was ending by falling from too great a height.
[11:01.31]Air serpent is defeated by air.
[11:02.77]Will water serpent be beaten with a super soaker?
[11:07.81]Yeah.
[11:10.73]Thanks, guys.
[11:11.55]Welcome.
[11:11.95]Welcome, Poke.
[11:13.05]Poke.
[11:15.47]Yeah, we haven't played Swindle Swans in at least, like,
[11:19.01]At least like four days.
[11:21.46]Alright, let's go.
[11:22.86]I turned on this machine.
[11:24.80]And I'm pointing it over here.
[11:25.76]I was going to go to this town over in this direction.
[11:31.28]Because we just rewound time.
[11:33.68]Wait, we didn't rewind.
[11:34.83]Nobody rewound anything.
[11:38.61]Let's just get out of here.
[11:42.27]Vote for Vic for First Noble.
[11:44.19]What's going on here?
[11:46.16]Okay, just to be climbed up I gotta swim across the lake Just giving German my money don't mind Well, thank you, but no no you can't call me a coward yet.
[11:58.82]No, you can't call me a coward yet Doesn't work like that Now yeah, oh yeah, I fought that okay, it's all coming back to me We fought that like weird scarecrow that shot fireballs that was the last thing that happened
[12:17.47]Let me... Okay, stream's still up.
[12:20.01]We're still up.
[12:22.09]We are still going.
[12:23.07]We're still stable.
[12:23.93]I'm so scared that I'm gonna look over here and... Oh, God.
[12:27.13]Oh, God.
[12:27.91]For a second.
[12:28.77]For one second, it just, like, it just dropped.
[12:33.59]I'm so nervous right now.
[12:35.59]I'm so scared.
[12:36.19]I keep peering over it.
[12:37.23]I keep seeing it blinking yellow.
[12:43.84]Oh, God.
[12:44.68]Oh, it's... Okay.
[12:45.80]It might happen again.
[12:48.73]This is fucking a hundred ting rate.
[12:52.39]Now, the guy that was on the boat was, from last time we played, he was the air serpent.
[13:01.31]So, fuck that guy.
[13:02.21]We're gonna go... You step out onto the forest one more... The forest?
[13:07.11]Okay, this is the island.
[13:08.43]You return to the shore of the lake.
[13:09.41]The pole with the bell marks the edge of the water.
[13:11.35]The little boat is still here.
[13:14.62]It's like when you look at the clock, it slows down.
[13:16.06]Yeah, I feel like I'm staring out like it's almost 3.30.
[13:18.32]Time to get out of school.
[13:21.32]Why would I push the boat out?
[13:25.18]I want to get in the boat.
[13:27.16]You push the boat out into the water in the lake and hop aboard.
[13:30.10]The craft looks well built and freshly oiled.
[13:32.56]You should make excellent time.
[13:34.93]Leave the shore.
[13:35.41]We're going to that town.
[13:37.84]You row the boat onwards across the water.
[13:39.39]Night falls.
[13:40.17]You should find somewhere safe to sleep, especially after so long rowing with an empty belly.
[13:45.21]You pull on the oars, sliding forward through the water.
[13:49.33]Okay.
[13:49.47]I could go down here, but I really don't want to go that way.
[13:54.14]I want to go back up to the town.
[13:57.38]Swim, you coward.
[13:58.22]I'm not getting in the water again.
[14:00.06]No way.
[14:01.41]Just bad shit happens when I get in the water.
[14:05.03]You roll the boat onwards across the water.
[14:06.53]Every stroke is hard through the strange thick water.
[14:10.08]You pause for a moment, several yards ahead.
[14:12.04]The water is bubbling upwards.
[14:16.16]They steer around it.
[14:18.59]Stop clicking.
[14:19.25]This is not World of Warcraft.
[14:20.47]This is sorcery.
[14:21.19]We are allowed to click here.
[14:25.19]Let's approach it.
[14:25.73]This could be the water serpent.
[14:26.71]That was like the next thing we were going to do.
[14:29.54]We're gonna fight the water serpent.
[14:30.82]Holy shit.
[14:31.32]We got like... We got like hundreds of bits coming in here.
[14:34.74]No name, Bob.
[14:35.50]People... Peoples!
[14:37.83]Stop clicking.
[14:38.67]Fahrenheit 616.
[14:39.19]Thanks a lot.
[14:40.05]Swim, you coward.
[14:41.51]I'm not a coward.
[14:42.57]I have plenty of stamina.
[14:44.01]I'm not gonna lose it.
[14:44.59]I gotta zap shit.
[14:45.37]You know what I mean?
[14:45.79]We gotta save that stamina for zaps.
[14:48.35]Never trust a purple.
[14:49.16]Inuyasha321123.
[14:49.76]Thanks for your subscription.
[14:53.48]Thank you to everybody else for the bits.
[14:56.96]And let's go.
[14:58.42]But we're going to approach it.
[14:59.04]This is probably the water serpent.
[15:01.45]Cautiously, you scull towards the frothing water.
[15:04.15]Closer in, you start to notice that as each bubble breaks on the surface, there is a sickly smell.
[15:10.77]Let's inhale it.
[15:13.53]Oh, what's that?
[15:13.95]Something stinks in there.
[15:14.95]Let me breathe it in.
[15:15.79]Let's breathe it in.
[15:19.64]You inhale cautiously.
[15:21.32]The smell makes your stomach turn, but somehow fills your nostrils with a heady, warm glow.
[15:26.92]You feel giddy and uplifted.
[15:28.49]I'm just doing drugs.
[15:31.41]There is somebody down at the bottom of the ocean smoking pot, and it's just coming up, and I'm just getting high off it.
[15:39.61]Did I do it again?
[15:40.19]Inhale again.
[15:43.87]You take another deep breath, arm and leg muscles swelling with strength.
[15:49.83]Should I do it again?
[15:50.35]I feel like if I inhale a third time, I'm gonna like pass out into the water and die.
[15:57.58]I don't know if I'm gonna do it again.
[16:00.90]Sounds like a bad idea.
[16:03.72]Do it again.
[16:05.80]You take another long breath at the gas from the breaking bubbles.
[16:08.92]It is wonderfully compelling.
[16:10.68]The taste is like something familiar, but you cannot quite place it.
[16:20.62]I'm not going to do more drugs.
[16:22.44]These are ocean drugs.
[16:23.86]I don't know where these are coming from.
[16:26.30]Four times?
[16:27.42]Should I do it a fourth time?
[16:31.10]More, more, more.
[16:33.50]Move away before you explode.
[16:39.72]Should I do it again?
[16:40.54]No.
[16:42.14]I have so much stamina.
[16:43.24]I've got plenty of money.
[16:46.93]Do I have to leave it up to you guys?
[16:49.83]Am I going to inhale the drugs one more time or am I getting the hell out of here?
[16:56.05]Let's see.
[16:57.27]First drop off.
[16:59.13]Inhale or get out of there.
[17:02.27]Let's do the first one of the evening.
[17:06.45]Here you go.
[17:16.31]What am I doing?
[17:22.99]I wonder how many people want to see me delve God.
[17:27.24]A lot of people want to see me inhale it again.
[17:31.44]Thanks a lot, Spartan Cupcake.
[17:33.42]Supo Fishy.
[17:35.80]For your subscription to the No Name Bob, just say no.
[17:40.04]Pot stream.
[17:42.22]I'm gonna pass out and fucking fall in the ocean and die.
[17:45.99]I'm just, like, huffing glue right now.
[17:47.61]Like, what the fuck?
[17:51.96]Might as well vote inhale.
[17:53.16]It's pointless to resist.
[17:54.22]Yeah, it is.
[17:58.12]Alright, yeah, it's over.
[18:00.10]There's no way this is coming back.
[18:04.97]And I'm inhaling again.
[18:06.13]Okay.
[18:08.07]Thank you for voting.
[18:09.21]All the people that want me to leave, sorry.
[18:10.37]There's no way it's getting overtaken.
[18:11.51]Poll is closed.
[18:12.09]Inhale.
[18:12.93]Inhale.
[18:14.73]Wanting to go closer to the smell, you toss yourself out of the boat and put your head under water, looking for a bubble on its way to the surface.
[18:22.41]You put your face into one and breathe in, feeling giddy and more alive than ever before as your throat and lungs fill with thick, syrupy water.
[18:32.52]I died.
[18:33.66]You have drowned in Lake Iklela.
[18:37.84]So I just, like, stuffed my head in the water and inhaled water?
[18:41.18]That's it, I'm dead.
[18:45.05]I don't even know how many deaths that is.
[18:54.88]Oh, you guys got what you wanted.
[18:55.94]I believe that's death number like 16.
[18:59.48]Yeah, I drowned in fucking pancake syrup.
[19:03.36]What a way to go.
[19:04.00]Approach it.
[19:07.56]Yeah, okay.
[19:08.48]We inhaled twice.
[19:11.13]I'm getting to 19 and I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[19:12.91]Alright, you take a deep breath, move away.
[19:14.95]Get out of there.
[19:17.37]You take another long breath of the gas from the breaking bubbles.
[19:20.03]No, move away.
[19:21.29]Move away quickly.
[19:21.93]I wanted to go closer.
[19:23.25]You stuff your head in the... No, I did it again.
[19:27.62]If you do it once, does it just kill you?
[19:29.14]Do you get addicted to it and can't leave?
[19:30.98]I did it again.
[19:34.20]I did it twice and then ran away.
[19:35.92]Oh my fucking god.
[19:37.34]I'm dead again.
[19:40.54]I don't think I can breathe this in once.
[19:42.12]Okay, we're gonna try this one more time.
[19:52.65]No, move away.
[19:53.99]You move quickly away, and the bubbles do not follow.
[19:56.79]Once a few furlongs distant, you look back and see the bubbles have ceased.
[20:03.11]Wait a little bit longer.
[20:05.03]You wait a little longer, but nothing changes.
[20:06.62]It seems whatever was here truly has moved on.
[20:10.26]Try once?
[20:10.90]No, you'll get addicted to it and die.
[20:16.44]OD on water.
[20:22.51]Okay, well, I died twice then.
[20:24.45]Wasn't supposed to die that much.
[20:29.43]Keep it up, Jeremy.
[20:30.01]Your videos mean so much to many people.
[20:31.97]Well, thank you, Birgishman, for seven months.
[20:33.37]Appreciate it, dude.
[20:35.25]I'm glad you enjoy the content.
[20:38.68]Alright, let's do what I was gonna- I'm no more like breathing in water drugs.
[20:41.54]We're going to the town.
[20:43.31]You row the boat onwards across the water.
[20:44.67]The stars are flooding the sky.
[20:47.37]The oars draw whirls and ripples on the surface of the lake with every stroke.
[20:51.77]Okay.
[20:54.07]Nope, we're gonna beeline right for the shore.
[20:57.85]It was Gabe the glue man Degrossi under the water with a snorkel.
[21:00.87]Why would he be doing drugs?
[21:05.18]You row the boat onwards across the water.
[21:06.26]The night air is freezing cold.
[21:07.41]Your breath freezes on your lips.
[21:09.75]You heave on the oars gliding onwards.
[21:11.43]The motion is calm and relaxing.
[21:13.61]Cool.
[21:14.83]But you seem to move no faster than a crawl.
[21:16.23]However hard you work, you've come within reach of a rocky island.
[21:19.03]Okay.
[21:23.44]I don't think I'm... No, I did go over here.
[21:24.74]That's where, like, the bell was.
[21:25.58]Yeah, just keep going.
[21:30.36]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:31.06]You row, row, row.
[21:32.16]Keep rowing.
[21:34.36]Near the shore.
[21:38.35]Oh, I was out on the water for a day.
[21:41.90]Oh, day 16.
[21:43.80]You lost a little gold, drowned yourself to death twice by doing drugs, and sat on a rowboat.
[21:49.20]Cool.
[21:50.74]Okay.
[21:52.00]What a... What a fucking productive day.
[21:59.80]Thanks a lot, Fahrenheit.
[22:02.20]I appreciate it, dude.
[22:05.24]Alright, that's what I'm talking about.
[22:06.42]Get out of the boat.
[22:07.24]We're gonna, like, roll the boat onto the shore.
[22:08.76]We're gonna, like, GTA this boat into, like, traffic.
[22:10.70]Alright.
[22:13.73]You roll the boat onwards across the water and then pull it up onto the shore.
[22:16.81]The sun has not yet crested in the last peaks in the east.
[22:21.77]I didn't even read that right.
[22:23.79]This place could not be more different than what you last saw.
[22:26.53]All around is hustle and bustle.
[22:28.37]The area above the shore teems with stalls and shoppers, and at the waterline, fishermen tend their boats, punting them out into the water.
[22:35.90]In the distance, you can make out a tall tower rising from one of the lake's many islands.
[22:40.12]The early morning sun makes the air glow.
[22:43.68]I believe they're talking about this thing, right?
[22:47.08]That thing.
[22:49.28]We're gonna go into the town, see if we can figure out some information.
[22:54.52]On the other side of the Bay Area from the waterfront is a line of stalls.
[22:57.26]Most sell food, grilled fish, and fruit.
[23:00.52]Though there is also a bottle seller selling stoppered bottles.
[23:07.01]Fishmonger, buy some bottles, visit the fruit seller.
[23:09.33]Of course, we go to the fruit seller first.
[23:12.39]You greet the fruit seller who waves his hand across his selection.
[23:15.47]One apple, two gold pieces, he declares.
[23:18.01]Find a Zanzuno apples.
[23:23.81]Okay.
[23:25.75]I'll buy some apples, you tell the hawker.
[23:27.13]How many?
[23:28.09]I'm going to buy as many as I can.
[23:32.23]Two, four, six, I can buy.
[23:33.79]I can buy two.
[23:36.37]I'll buy two.
[23:38.40]I shall go to you, the man replies, accepting your coins.
[23:41.30]You put the fruit into your pack.
[23:44.28]Now let's go visit the fucking fished face fuck over here.
[23:47.78]The fishmonger is a large woman who wields an enormous cleaver.
[23:52.13]I chop it and grit it for you.
[23:53.93]She announces staring you threateningly in the eye.
[23:56.19]Four gold pieces for head.
[23:58.13]I have the same fucking voice as the guy that was just selling you the other shit.
[24:04.15]I don't have enough money.
[24:06.92]Advanced math.
[24:12.06]I can't.
[24:12.34]No.
[24:12.46]Let's see.
[24:12.80]When can I steal shit?
[24:17.79]Get some bottles.
[24:19.96]You stop at the bottle seller's stall.
[24:21.44]He has shelves and shelves of bottles of all different shapes and sizes and colors.
[24:25.89]A few are filled, but most are empty.
[24:27.95]You greet the bottle seller.
[24:31.09]Why does he have empty bottles?
[24:34.97]Look at the empty bottles.
[24:37.17]You look over the man's collection of empty bottles.
[24:38.73]They come in every size, from that of your thumb up to tankards as large as your thigh.
[24:43.50]They are thin bottles and portly bottles and bottles in every shade of colored grass.
[24:48.67]Thin bottles, fat bottles, green bottles, orange bottles.
[24:51.55]This is like Dr. Seuss.
[24:53.17]Some twist and corkscrew, some are deliciously floated.
[24:56.66]Most are very well made indeed.
[24:57.94]Okay, what's with the bottles?
[25:00.90]You have a lot of bottles here, your mark.
[25:02.96]The bottle seller smiles.
[25:06.73]It is not my passion, if that is what you mean.
[25:09.27]But I am very, very good at making bottles, as you can see.
[25:13.55]Okay.
[25:14.43]Who cares?
[25:15.93]You scan over the filled bottles.
[25:17.27]Most seem to contain nothing but colored water and are probably filled simply to show off the craftsmanship of the glass.
[25:22.49]But a rack at the front appears to contain blimberry potion and the row behind is labeled holy water from the temple of the mule.
[25:28.25]We're going to change gods here?
[25:38.12]How much is the holy water?
[25:40.17]Holy water is most valuable, the hawker says.
[25:43.09]An excellent wedding present, for example.
[25:45.01]And good for magic.
[25:46.93]Hence the craftsmanship of the glass.
[25:49.33]Ten gold pieces.
[25:51.09]Fuck yourself.
[25:51.79]That's too expensive.
[25:53.45]It is not entirely the cost of the liquid.
[25:55.34]The bottle is the highest quality.
[25:58.22]Oh, fuck you.
[25:59.20]You smile and shake your head.
[26:00.98]And you take out your sword and drive it through his neck.
[26:05.88]Now, I'll see you later.
[26:06.78]I'm not paying.
[26:07.34]I don't have the money.
[26:08.71]Get out of here.
[26:10.51]You move away from the stalls, the air moves a little, still icy, but fresh.
[26:16.69]That's all I can do in this dumb town?
[26:20.67]Punch him in the nose?
[26:23.03]Punch him right in the face.
[26:28.01]Okay, the shore.
[26:29.05]Is there anything I can do here?
[26:30.59]Where the boats are?
[26:35.14]The boat you arrived in is waiting for you by the shore.
[26:37.32]No, step away from the water.
[26:42.22]I'm not going for a swim.
[26:44.08]I'm gonna go up here.
[26:47.46]You turn away from the lake shore and follow the paved road back along the riverbank.
[26:53.58]Up here.
[26:54.36]We can activate this one.
[26:56.34]I gotta get this.
[26:57.84]Yeah, this is a new area up here.
[26:59.32]Let's get up there.
[27:01.88]Thanks a lot, Saladongs.
[27:03.88]Also, thank you to everyone that just gave some bits there.
[27:07.46]It was a bunch of you.
[27:08.26]Thank you, guys.
[27:09.31]Thank you, Berkishman, for seven months.
[27:12.69]I think I caught everybody.
[27:13.99]I think.
[27:14.39]I hope.
[27:15.70]Although I'm a piece of shit and I miss everybody.
[27:17.42]What's going on, Poobo?
[27:19.10]Thank you for six months.
[27:20.30]That is half a year if you didn't know.
[27:27.03]Whoa, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[27:28.77]You leave the shore for an old road across the plains.
[27:30.77]It is very warm now.
[27:31.75]You are starting to sweat in your tunic.
[27:33.94]A little dust blows across the surface of the ancient road.
[27:36.74]Suddenly, you hear the sound of hoofbeats.
[27:39.62]Something is coming towards you along the old stones.
[27:42.10]The next thing you know, you're knocked flying by a low-armored creature.
[27:45.32]It's a roach pig.
[27:47.15]Oh, shit, a roach pig.
[27:49.81]Throw the chakram.
[27:54.39]What chakram?
[27:54.75]What chakram?
[27:56.98]What the hell are they talking about?
[28:02.64]Are we going to have some fried pork tonight?
[28:08.97]I think so.
[28:14.37]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[28:16.05]Let's make sure we're not doing anything too hasty here.
[28:19.62]I can talk with animals.
[28:22.76]You want to talk to this guy?
[28:25.46]I can either zap him.
[28:26.40]I can either zap or yap.
[28:27.72]Zap him or yap him.
[28:30.35]I can either yap him or zap him.
[28:35.65]Yap?
[28:35.97]Should I yap him?
[28:38.24]I'm gonna yap him.
[28:42.94]Alright, let's talk.
[28:46.11]Taking the wig from your pack, you wear it and form your spell.
[28:48.73]The roach pig's snuffling transform into delicately formed speech.
[28:53.45]Indeed, it seems to recognize that you can understand it almost immediately.
[28:57.69]Well now, it purrs in an amiable voice.
[29:01.12]What manner of creature are you to be listening to an old pig like me?
[29:06.24]I'm a traveler.
[29:07.74]You tell it.
[29:09.30]So are we all, the pig replies philosophically.
[29:13.12]So long as we have legs and we use them well, then in return, I am a pig.
[29:20.83]How is life as a pig?
[29:24.05]It's quite fascinating.
[29:25.59]We are naturally curious types, and since we cannot write or do as you can, and he gestures with his trotters as he speaks, we must observe and think instead.
[29:37.57]Sure, that pronunciation will do.
[29:41.15]Do you play swindle stones?
[29:45.16]Please say yes.
[29:47.02]The dice game?
[29:47.82]I have observed humans playing it, it seems to me.
[29:51.62]It is purely a game of luck, and the element of bluff is there merely to disguise the fact.
[29:57.23]I may be wrong, of course.
[29:59.05]The pig thoughtfully cleans on Trotter with its tongue.
[30:01.61]God damn it, I can't play swindle swings with a fucking pig.
[30:08.63]That would have been awesome.
[30:09.93]That's not cool.
[30:13.69]What can you tell me of the seven serpents?
[30:16.44]Well, there's one in the fissure near the lake.
[30:19.46]You must have come that way, so perhaps you've already met him.
[30:22.72]Horrible thing.
[30:24.14]Otherwise, none in Tin Pang that I know of.
[30:27.12]But the lake is teeming with them.
[30:29.02]The water, the islands, they're everywhere.
[30:32.92]What serpents are in the lake?
[30:35.23]The pig beats its lower jaw against the ground in a gesture your spell is unable to translate.
[30:40.45]My apologies.
[30:41.40]They did not stop to give me their names.
[30:43.84]You can feel the spell beginning to fade.
[30:50.10]Draw my sword.
[30:51.30]Thanks for the info.
[30:53.52]I'm going to fucking murder you.
[30:58.74]No, I can't do that.
[31:00.74]He was too nice to me.
[31:03.28]Just zap him.
[31:10.01]Bacon.
[31:10.67]Bacon.
[31:11.28]I could get some meat from him, probably.
[31:12.82]Don't kill it.
[31:14.52]Don't do it.
[31:22.76]I don't know.
[31:23.72]I don't know what to do here.
[31:25.18]No.
[31:25.46]No.
[31:25.56]Bye, pig.
[31:28.82]You take a moment to say goodbye to the pig.
[31:30.74]The creature bobs its head at you and then stumbles away down the road and you let it go.
[31:34.54]Looking northwards, you can see the northern reaches of the Zanzunu Peaks.
[31:38.90]Somewhere there lie the ruins of the ancient city of Tin Pang, once filled with the Archmage's most devout followers.
[31:45.97]Death, why?
[31:46.63]Oh, I thought somebody just gave me a death.
[31:48.55]I didn't die there.
[31:49.17]It was fine.
[31:51.23]Two new clues.
[31:55.07]Yeah, so he's in that lake.
[31:59.61]Now how the fuck do I get him to come out?
[32:02.87]I'm going up here for now.
[32:04.29]I can come back there.
[32:07.07]You follow the old road.
[32:07.97]The sun has reached its highest point now.
[32:09.55]Out of the shade, the air is baking hot.
[32:11.31]You continue to walk.
[32:14.45]Follow the road.
[32:19.20]The road curves gently as you follow it.
[32:20.66]Heat beats down from an empty sky.
[32:22.20]The road passes between the pillars of a ruined stone gate and then opens out into a wide plaza of low ruins.
[32:29.96]Look at the ruins.
[32:31.86]Door frames jut from the unforgiving sands.
[32:34.42]Windows stare like dead eyes from buildings molded into the rising cliff itself.
[32:38.91]This place must have been magnificent once, but now even the specters must have been shredded by the wind.
[32:45.90]Let's go.
[32:47.32]The silent city echoes to the sound of your footsteps on the road.
[32:49.78]You are aware you are headed away from Zamen and not towards it, but perhaps the ruins of this place will have something to aid you.
[32:58.98]It's pretty big.
[32:59.96]This place is going to be a lot of stuff to do here, I think.
[33:06.29]Bacon.
[33:06.91]Bacon Hut.
[33:08.81]Thanks a lot, BigMarsh213 and Drewster389 for your subscriptions.
[33:12.83]Welcome to the channel.
[33:13.98]Thank you.
[33:17.74]You follow the outline of a street into the first of several open plazas.
[33:20.94]It seems this was once a city.
[33:23.10]Hewn in vertical layers into the northern cliff face itself.
[33:26.58]Now it is as though a great clawed creature has scratched it from existence.
[33:30.89]A few dwellings remain, but most are broken piles.
[33:34.23]Only one structure remains standing, a tower that rises somewhere to the west.
[33:38.47]The afternoon is drawing on.
[33:41.61]Well, this is going to turn this on and I can get this place to where it was in the past.
[33:46.49]Go not right.
[33:51.05]Go right.
[33:53.49]Let's explore this first before we turn it back.
[33:59.37]High city.
[34:21.19]You head upward towards the cliff face, jumping over cracks in the ground, and then clambering from the roof of one of the buildings into the gaping doorway of the next.
[34:29.35]Mosaics in the floor and painted walls speak of great wealth, but their patterns can no longer be discerned.
[34:37.11]Search closely.
[34:39.13]You search every corner and look through every window and crack, but you find nothing.
[34:42.95]It seems that whoever lived here left, they took everything they could carry with them.
[34:47.87]On the high street above the city, you find a house, perhaps the grandest so far, whose stones are daubed in print and print.
[34:54.57]Big print.
[34:55.47]Big fucking print letters.
[34:57.01]Red.
[34:58.91]Go inside.
[35:00.79]You look inside the walls of the red-painted house.
[35:02.39]Nothing remains, of course.
[35:03.87]Just the outlines in the stone of a small room with a fire pit at the back.
[35:08.46]Something white lies in the hearth, perhaps the remains of something long since burned.
[35:13.58]Touch it.
[35:14.30]Grab it.
[35:16.45]You go over to the fireplace and what... Look... And what look at first... And what you see at first... And what looks... God, this is just tripping me up.
[35:24.43]What look at first like discarded dice turn out to be a set of teeth.
[35:29.15]You turn them over in your hands trying to place what creature they are from.
[35:33.55]Giant?
[35:34.03]Goblin?
[35:34.69]Snattercat?
[35:35.57]Ape?
[35:36.05]Human?
[35:38.85]Snattercat.
[35:40.11]Snattercat, of course!
[35:41.53]They have the curved, talon-like profile of a big cat's tooth.
[35:44.25]You have found three for what use they are.
[35:47.63]Take them.
[35:48.57]You place them into your pack, perhaps they will be useful to you at some point.
[35:53.39]Snattercats.
[35:57.34]Alright, we got Snattercat teeth.
[36:01.10]I wish I could have played Swindle Stones with that pig.
[36:03.25]Goddamn.
[36:03.71]That would have been awesome.
[36:09.11]You continue along the curving street until you pass a large doorway in the surprisingly intact ruins of a hall.
[36:14.93]Lying in the doorway is where the lead-dead-drunk-mad-of-ass-of-oversize-finger is just hanging out there.
[36:19.40]Take a look.
[36:21.06]A dead giant, perhaps?
[36:22.88]If so, you might be able to acquire a few more precious teeth to add to your collection.
[36:26.22]This is like the Teeth Town!
[36:28.42]You follow the line of the finger inside the building along the length of an arm that disappears under a pile of rubble and stones.
[36:37.13]Hey, in case you wanted more teeth,
[36:40.10]Now they're going to stomp the finger.
[36:42.34]You kick the finger, nothing happens.
[36:43.68]Now I'm going to unbury the arm.
[36:49.39]You go over to the rubble and begin to haul it away.
[36:52.09]Once you have cleared a few rocks, you begin to see the first wisps of thick hair from the giant's beard underneath the stone.
[36:59.66]If he is in fact dead, he cannot have died too long ago.
[37:05.22]Keep working.
[37:06.26]You keep working, removing stones with an aim to reaching the giant's lower jaw.
[37:10.45]But after removing a flat slab of stone from across his mouth, you are struck by a hot, wet blast of breath.
[37:16.77]The giant is not dead at all.
[37:18.23]He is sleeping.
[37:20.45]Oh, shit.
[37:22.07]Wait, is he awake?
[37:24.67]He's not awake.
[37:27.19]He's not awake.
[37:27.77]He's still asleep.
[37:29.78]We haven't woken him up yet.
[37:33.64]What can we do?
[37:35.59]Okay, I could turn into a giant here and we could have like a giant boxing match.
[37:40.47]Should I just grow into a giant and fucking stomp his head?
[37:46.01]That would work.
[37:49.84]Walk, create a shield.
[37:51.04]No, I'm not doing that.
[37:52.54]He'll break it.
[37:56.36]Do Raz.
[37:57.46]Let's sharpen the blade.
[37:58.58]Alright, well obviously this guy wants to fight at some point, I think.
[38:03.84]Float in the air.
[38:07.76]No, I think I'm going to be giant, man.
[38:10.28]And we're going to have a huge boxing match.
[38:13.39]I'm going to knock his teeth out for him.
[38:15.29]I could turn to stone.
[38:20.09]What's that?
[38:20.61]That's so useless?
[38:21.35]He can just pick me up and just carry me around.
[38:24.82]Yeah, we're going big.
[38:27.25]You fucking razzle him?
[38:29.46]Alright, big boys, here we go, big boy!
[38:31.44]You craft the enchantment, inflating to more than twice your usual height, but your spellcasting has clearly agitated the creature.
[38:39.18]It wakes instantly, roaring to its feet, throwing aside the rest of the stone that has fallen on during its sleep, and grabbing a club from nearby.
[38:46.61]Why is he that much bigger than me?
[38:49.79]He's so much bigger than me still!
[38:52.71]Lookit, I come up to his fucking chest!
[38:55.17]He has so much more stamina?
[38:59.30]Shit.
[39:00.32]Um... Oh my god.
[39:02.96]He did a 1.7 swing.
[39:03.76]Are you shitting me?
[39:07.05]Zap.
[39:07.79]There was no zap.
[39:13.39]With a roar that shakes the ruin, the giant swings its club and comes for you, determined to crack open your bones.
[39:19.25]You raise your sword to cover your enormous body as he tries to push you back with his great hand.
[39:24.38]You are mostly unhurt.
[39:26.46]Full blast.
[39:29.15]Yep.
[39:30.09]Three.
[39:30.93]Three stamina.
[39:31.53]Got him.
[39:33.11]Lumbering in, you move in, aiming to trap the giant against the far wall of the street.
[39:37.43]Readying a massive blow that could part stone, you stomp forwards.
[39:40.66]He deflects as well as he can.
[39:42.06]He doubles over in pain.
[39:43.66]Again.
[39:45.00]Fuck.
[39:47.44]He was doubling... He was just doubling over in pain.
[39:49.66]You gotta be kidding me.
[39:55.62]That's not good.
[39:59.25]Is the sword still small?
[40:00.55]I got the same tiny sword.
[40:03.82]I don't know why that's so funny to me.
[40:11.64]I'm huge, but I have, like, in my index finger and thumb, I'm holding between those two fingers a tiny little sword, and I'm just, like, poking him.
[40:23.01]Yeah, he's gonna use my bones because his stupid eyes are watching you closely, not wanting to take a risk.
[40:31.06]I can safely come out of here.
[40:33.46]Oh, you fucking god damn it.
[40:37.08]God damn it.
[40:41.40]2.1 to 2.
[40:43.18]I'm just dead.
[40:44.00]Just fucking kill me.
[40:49.88]Drop down, protecting yourself as best you can, as the giant jabs with its club.
[40:54.60]You step smartly aside.
[40:56.44]Then the gigantic club catches you square on the side of the head.
[41:00.16]That cracking sound is your skull, splitting apart like a fruit.
[41:11.86]It just catches me, like, right in the side of the fucking face.
[41:18.68]Alright, well, here we go.
[41:20.72]That was number 21.
[41:21.86]This is death number 21.
[41:29.04]Alright, so I'm coming at him with like four.
[41:33.68]There we go.
[41:34.16]Good.
[41:34.76]Boom.
[41:35.36]He's down to eight.
[41:36.32]Right off the bat.
[41:37.32]Fruit, eat it up.
[41:43.60]Why is the video delayed?
[41:44.78]It shouldn't be.
[41:48.47]Shouldn't be delayed.
[41:49.09]Alright, he doubles over in pain.
[41:53.67]Last time he doubled over in pain, he, like, attacked me with 10 stamina.
[41:56.77]Yeah, really good.
[41:58.13]Now I got a lot to work with.
[42:01.16]He raises his club across his body defensively.
[42:03.16]Alright, let's go in with, like, a 5.5.
[42:04.36]Like, 5.0.
[42:04.66]That did 2.
[42:05.04]That did 2 really well.
[42:07.04]Defend now, please.
[42:19.75]Cautious but angry, he stomps the ground with one enormous foot growling.
[42:23.37]I feel like he's coming in hard here.
[42:26.53]Yep.
[42:27.37]I probably could have beat that.
[42:28.95]If I went full blast.
[42:31.43]He lifts his club across his body.
[42:33.01]Full blast.
[42:34.61]Oh, fuck me.
[42:35.65]It's alright.
[42:36.17]He's almost dead.
[42:38.41]The giant stumbles suddenly.
[42:39.41]He is weakening.
[42:40.91]Defend.
[42:43.95]I was gonna go full blast.
[42:45.30]I was thinking about it.
[42:47.78]Go 0.1.
[42:53.27]Alright, he did 2.1 was the last time he beat me.
[42:55.85]2.2, buddy.
[42:58.55]One more.
[42:58.99]Full blast.
[43:00.93]His eyes follow your movements cautiously.
[43:03.35]He's moving much slower now.
[43:04.39]Okay, he's coming in hard.
[43:06.45]Should I defend?
[43:07.17]Yeah.
[43:08.71]Ah!
[43:11.83]Now he's gonna come in real hard.
[43:14.86]Yep.
[43:15.84]Okay.
[43:16.46]Now I full blast him and he loses.
[43:19.62]Full blast.
[43:21.20]9.4.
[43:21.36]Dead.
[43:22.00]See you later, giant.
[43:25.34]Hefting your sword, you move forward, preparing a massive swing that could cleave a tree trunk.
[43:29.56]You pound for your opponent.
[43:31.68]Then your sword slips between the giant's ribs and he falls, gasping his last in a noise like a gushing waterfall.
[43:39.41]Oh yeah.
[43:40.61]Yeah, competent.
[43:41.49]Five stamina lost.
[43:42.63]Competent combat.
[43:45.35]Just that.
[43:45.73]That's just enough to zap and then die.
[43:49.21]You stagger back, wiping the sweat from your brow and regarding the fallen creature.
[43:52.27]It is far from its Shumanati home.
[43:54.59]It must have become lost out here.
[43:55.73]Now it will never return.
[43:57.53]Take its teeth.
[43:59.47]You go to remove the giant's teach.
[44:01.09]Teeth?
[44:02.17]With... You go... You go to remove the giant's teats, which are most valuable for spellcasting.
[44:10.27]But before you can get your sword into the lower gum, the body of the creature begins to shrink by almost a hand spin.
[44:16.19]A moment later, it shrinks again.
[44:17.89]What?
[44:19.45]Rip his teeth out quick.
[44:21.47]You hurry over aiming to work more quickly and have time to pry loose one tooth before the creature's mouth is shrunk to a normal human size and you are unable to fit the blade of your sword into its mouth.
[44:31.90]But the tooth on the floor has shrunk as well.
[44:34.48]Soon you are lying by a dead body holding one of its incisor teeth in your hand.
[44:41.67]So this dude was just a regular guy?
[44:43.11]He didn't look like a regular guy.
[44:48.69]So let's look at him.
[44:52.07]You regard the dead body somewhat guiltily and quite puzzled.
[44:56.53]What you fought a moment ago was most definitely a giant, but this is just a man.
[45:00.47]An ugly man, true, but nothing stranger than that.
[45:03.89]He must have been enchanted.
[45:05.11]Nothing to see here.
[45:07.83]He was just real ugly.
[45:10.75]Keeping the tooth.
[45:12.77]So this is just a regular human tooth?
[45:14.95]What am I going to do with that?
[45:17.25]You shove the tooth into your pouch.
[45:19.03]Though it is a macabre souvenir of this poor wretch.
[45:22.15]Then you leave the body for whatever wild beasts inhabit these ruins at night.
[45:25.61]Your loop of the upper city is finished.
[45:27.84]Gradually you shrink back down to your normal size.
[45:29.98]The evening is drawing in.
[45:33.96]I want to explore here.
[45:35.32]Do I have any brimbleberry?
[45:36.56]I have holy water.
[45:43.80]No, I don't really have anything.
[45:49.28]It's not how you say that word.
[45:50.79]Welcome to the sorcery streams, where I mispronounce every word.
[45:54.33]I want to explore the lower city.
[46:02.73]Brimbleberry.
[46:05.09]You walk through the ruins of the buildings that spread across the floor of the valley.
[46:08.33]One seems to be a large warehouse, though whatever was stored here has been taken by the winds long ago.
[46:15.26]Thanks a lot, Blackstaff.
[46:17.98]your subscription thank you to sojin sojin you for seven months let's go full blast I agree thank you for the bits those guys that came in with the bits aubrey is myth thank you for four months pessimist prime thanks for the sub dude and I think I got y'all thanks a lot guys thanks a lot all right keep exploring let's keep exploring
[46:41.60]You pick your way over a low wall and through the shattered outline of a family home.
[46:45.08]A vague depression in one corner indicates an old fire pit.
[46:51.81]You scratch in the dirt of the fire pit for a time but find nothing beyond a few shards of broken pottery.
[46:56.33]You leave the old house by what was once the doorway.
[46:59.25]Scratched on the doorstep is a chiseled mark, perhaps a drawing of some kind.
[47:04.43]Sure, look at the marks.
[47:06.42]You squat to examine the marks.
[47:08.12]They were perhaps once more detailed and are almost worn away by the scouring dust.
[47:12.98]A cat, large and striped, is curled up into a ring for warmth.
[47:22.21]Is the cat sleeping there?
[47:29.81]I can sense danger.
[47:32.21]Is the cat just a trap?
[47:33.27]Am I gonna get, like, bit by a cat?
[47:34.53]Alright, I can fi- oh.
[47:41.49]I can just shoot a fi- I can't shoot a fireball at the cat, sorry.
[47:46.87]Uh, I think really all I can do here is sense danger.
[47:53.45]See the future.
[47:56.37]Eat the cat.
[47:58.35]That might be a Schneider cat.
[48:00.36]Alright, I'm gonna see the future.
[48:02.18]We have the Crystal Orb, might as well use it.
[48:05.22]You sit cross-legged on the flagstones and put your palms on the orb of a crystal.
[48:09.60]Reaching up to the constellations overhead, you create the spell and everything changes.
[48:13.46]Your vision is suddenly overtaken by a strange sight.
[48:16.38]A yawning, sleeping serpent of immense proportions who seems to move faster than the eye can see.
[48:22.33]It's a fucking serpent.
[48:23.71]The cat's a serpent.
[48:27.67]Good thing I fucking grabbed that crystal.
[48:30.07]Cat's a serpent.
[48:33.06]Okay, let's watch it.
[48:35.25]The serpent never moves, but sometimes as you watch, it becomes into different positions than before, head resting this way, arms stretched or talons curled.
[48:44.14]There is no state of change, merely different states of being.
[48:47.68]The serpent opens one eye and fixes you with it.
[48:50.82]You again, it groans in a clearly spoken mockery of the common tongue.
[48:55.45]Come to die once more.
[48:59.20]Who are you?
[49:00.70]I am death.
[49:02.46]I am passing, forgetfulness, age, and decay.
[49:05.78]I am time.
[49:07.06]Run!
[49:14.33]fucking kill you you tell it how demands the serpent you have already died or has that not happened yet the time serpent shifts and returns to sleep the vision fades darkness closes in and you are worn out you need to rest especially after traveling all day without eating there's nothing more to be done you loop through another house but find nothing these streets have been reduced to mere marks in the dust
[49:42.37]There are no signs left to tell you what happened here.
[49:45.31]The moon is climbing.
[49:46.07]Okay.
[49:48.21]So the time serpent sits in here.
[49:53.91]Huh.
[49:58.45]Should I try that again?
[50:00.71]Just kill him?
[50:06.48]Well, let's go to the tower.
[50:08.95]The cat is definitely the fucking serpent.
[50:11.49]Dude, that's... The death serpent knows of my past mistakes, probably.
[50:15.49]Yeah, that's a good theory.
[50:16.45]Let's go inside.
[50:18.72]Inside of the tower is much like the others you've seen.
[50:27.38]Except that perhaps it was once decorated.
[50:29.86]Okay, sleep here.
[50:31.32]You settled down in the quiet of the tower.
[50:32.52]You've eaten nothing today.
[50:34.06]Eat something.
[50:35.62]I have... Yeah, I have three.
[50:37.22]Eat a fucking snatter apple.
[50:40.79]Taking the cooked fish from your pack.
[50:42.39]What?
[50:42.61]I had cooked fish?
[50:43.73]You fill your empty stomach.
[50:45.33]Then you stretch out and rest.
[50:46.41]You are protected here and your rest is unbroken by dreams.
[50:50.13]Day 17.
[50:52.09]You've gained one provision and lost some gold.
[50:54.13]Explored the city of Timpang and found three new clues.
[51:00.38]Let's go activate this crystal.
[51:02.16]Because obviously we have to.
[51:06.02]Activate the beacon.
[51:08.78]Adjust the beam.
[51:11.11]Alright, so we can aim it on the town here.
[51:16.94]So that's where the time serpent was.
[51:18.48]Let's just go there in the past and see if he's there again.
[51:21.82]See if we can fucking kill him.
[51:25.26]Zap that motherfucker out of existence.
[51:28.21]No, zap him into existence because he's time.
[51:31.71]We can touch the blue crystal.
[51:33.59]Get some stamina.
[51:35.45]Alright, so we're up here.
[51:38.70]So I can go over here, I can try to find the time serpent again.
[51:41.06]Or explore this place in the past.
[51:43.17]Or I can try to find the fucking water serpent.
[51:45.37]He's down here somewhere.
[51:47.89]Who knows where the hell he is.
[51:50.97]I'm gonna stick around here for now.
[51:53.39]Yeah, just stay here.
[51:55.53]Let's leave.
[51:57.63]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:58.81]Climb down.
[52:01.78]Point at the town.
[52:02.84]Just like launch a fucking arcane missile over the town.
[52:09.43]You head off into the city once more.
[52:10.84]The air stirs a little, still cold but fresh.
[52:13.22]The streets are suddenly alive with activity.
[52:15.46]People roam the streets, calling to one another and talking.
[52:18.14]Musicians stand on the street corners playing lively jigs to passersby.
[52:22.08]A nearby building pumps yellow tinged smoke into the air.
[52:26.45]You make your way along the busy bustling streets, marveling at all the people.
[52:30.75]They do not realize they are ghosts.
[52:33.89]It's a thriving hub.
[52:35.66]It's a great place.
[52:37.54]And out here in the depths of the Backlands, knowledge of such a city has been long lost.
[52:41.62]It has never been mentioned in Analand.
[52:46.07]Okay.
[52:49.77]Well, I'm going to go back up here.
[52:50.93]We'll just make our rounds.
[52:54.15]Wait until you have four arcane charges and then zap.
[52:58.78]God.
[53:03.28]That's a good call back to last stream.
[53:05.98]You follow the winding, climbing, stepped streets into the upper reaches of the city.
[53:12.11]Low hovels and clustered dwellings are replaced by larger buildings, mansions, palaces, and central offices.
[53:18.15]You pass a familiar building, daubed in red paint, with two doors.
[53:22.28]Look in the building.
[53:24.34]Above one door is a sign with a picture of a fanged tooth.
[53:27.70]Above the other is a metal implement that looks like a small pair of tongs.
[53:33.64]Tooth door or tong door?
[53:36.50]Tooth or tong?
[53:37.08]I'm gonna go tooth.
[53:40.64]You open the door to find it leads into a wide hall, which the other door also opens into.
[53:45.97]In a large chair at one end sits a man with a tight-fitting leather cap.
[53:50.41]On a low table at his elbow rests an array of metal implements.
[53:54.51]He stands as you enter.
[53:59.84]Greetings, declares the merchant.
[54:01.72]Are you here to buy or sell?
[54:03.91]A strange question since there appears to be nothing on sale.
[54:06.97]Unless the goods are all behind the curtain that covers the black wall.
[54:10.23]Back wall.
[54:12.91]What is your trade?
[54:13.61]Buy?
[54:14.01]Sell?
[54:15.51]What do you trade?
[54:16.85]You ask Puzzles.
[54:17.49]He seems surprised.
[54:18.75]You didn't see the sign?
[54:22.09]You're a dentist?
[54:24.58]That is a nasty word for it.
[54:26.48]It is as though I called you a conjurer.
[54:28.60]He shuffles a few documents on a low table by his arm.
[54:32.06]But do I take it then you are simply not in the market for teeth?
[54:37.24]Teeth?
[54:38.65]Indeed.
[54:39.33]Teeth of all kinds.
[54:41.81]What kinds do you sell?
[54:43.11]I have teeth to sell.
[54:44.23]I do.
[54:45.69]I have a shitload of teeth.
[54:48.31]I have teeth.
[54:49.97]He leans forward keenly.
[54:51.82]Your own teeth or those of others?
[54:57.34]You'd buy my teeth?
[54:59.75]Indeed I would.
[55:00.97]The man peers closely at you and then nods.
[55:03.49]One of your molars, perhaps?
[55:05.09]A molar from good stock is always a precious commodity.
[55:07.71]How much for a molar?
[55:14.07]For one of yours, well, I would say 30 gold pieces at least.
[55:18.44]You're strong and intelligent.
[55:19.98]I can see that much from the curve of your incisors.
[55:22.60]Would that seem fair to you?
[55:25.70]Okay, yeah, that's 30 fucking gold.
[55:28.81]Yes, sell a tooth.
[55:30.53]The man beams with pleasure and counts out 30 gold pieces, which he places in a stack on a low table next to a pair of iron tongs.
[55:38.25]Then he stands from his chair and gestures for you to sit down.
[55:42.95]Snatch the money and run.
[55:44.24]All right, sit down.
[55:47.40]Nervously, you lower yourself into the chair.
[55:50.06]The merchant locks one door and then the other.
[55:53.15]Now, please don't scream too loudly, or my neighbors will complain.
[55:58.15]What follows is protracted and painful.
[56:00.77]The man puts one foot upon the armrest of the chair to gain enough leverage, and then he shoves the tongue so deep into your mouth that you gag.
[56:09.34]Then, with a combination of yanking, twisting, tugging, and hammering, he finally draws the tooth from your gum with a sickening squelch.
[56:17.56]You are left sweating and dizzy.
[56:19.24]Your tooth disappears into the back room.
[56:25.78]Alright, let's wait a few minutes.
[56:28.52]You gasp and try to recover your strength.
[56:30.94]Do you have anything more to sell?
[56:32.60]He asks as he presses a towel to your bleeding mouth and drops the money into your pouch.
[56:38.50]I have treat of cheap as well.
[56:40.64]No more.
[56:47.28]I have more teeth.
[56:49.32]I have creature of cheap as well.
[56:51.22]You tell him through thick lips.
[56:53.71]And
[56:56.13]And from what creature, he asks?
[56:58.05]Govrin.
[56:59.53]Who of Shneverkev?
[57:01.13]Oh, God, this is great.
[57:09.65]Shneverkev.
[57:11.67]His eyes light up.
[57:13.07]A most useful tooth, indeed.
[57:15.25]And very hard to come by.
[57:16.33]I will give you eight gold pieces per tooth.
[57:20.22]I hope that is acceptable.
[57:23.32]That's too little.
[57:25.43]Ten then, but I could not go higher.
[57:29.37]I'll sell you one.
[57:31.95]You take out one tooth and hand it over to the merchant whistles for a lackey who takes it into a back room and returns with ten gold pieces.
[57:37.62]Anything else?
[57:39.92]Fife off.
[57:42.66]Fife off.
[57:43.12]What the fuck is fife off?
[57:48.98]That's human.
[57:50.69]That's goblin.
[57:52.39]Fife off.
[57:56.41]Human.
[57:57.69]You pull out the tooth, but the salesman shakes his head.
[58:00.25]My apologies.
[58:01.31]I cannot buy teeth from humans without knowing their stock and character.
[58:04.60]Humans in the wild are simply too... unreliable.
[58:08.30]No more, he asks.
[58:11.56]Uh... Fife off.
[58:14.54]He considers for a moment, sucking at his cheeks.
[58:17.82]What does that mean?
[58:18.32]I don't understand that.
[58:20.64]Then he shakes his head.
[58:21.38]I have one already, and they do not sell well.
[58:24.71]Firefoxes are admittedly of limited use.
[58:27.27]Most people prefer a simple fire spell to snapping a tooth.
[58:30.91]No more?
[58:32.87]Goughlin.
[58:34.84]He shakes his head.
[58:35.56]A goblin's tooth isn't worth the sales tax.
[58:38.86]Anyone can get three or four with a decent wooden club and a little patience.
[58:42.91]He mimes a vicious cross-wing and smiles.
[58:46.01]No more, he asks.
[58:47.27]You ready to go?
[58:48.49]I have roughest bush off of you.
[58:54.76]You open your arms to raise the spell, but the merchant catches your arm.
[58:57.52]Try if you must.
[58:58.86]But we have a mini-mite chained up in the back room.
[59:01.52]We don't want people testing out the merchandise in the shop.
[59:04.33]You understand.
[59:08.01]Am I going to be like this for the rest of the fucking game?
[59:13.51]I think I'm going to be talking like this forever.
[59:17.16]I am very wise, he agrees.
[59:19.26]I have a few rarities in my position.
[59:21.72]A genuine fire fox tooth in my prized position, the tooth of a rock demon.
[59:26.98]How much for the fucking rock demon?
[59:35.41]Ah, he replies with a gleam.
[59:36.97]You are a man of taste, I see.
[59:38.97]Zequix.
[59:40.01]He snaps his fingers and a stooped figure appears from the back carrying an enormous crystal rock.
[59:44.79]It is clearly extremely heavy.
[59:48.33]In perfect condition, as you see.
[59:50.33]Virtually flawless.
[59:51.45]Yours for a mere 32 gold pieces.
[59:57.86]That's too much.
[59:59.84]Too much is the price my servant paid in getting it.
[60:03.08]You will have to believe me on that one.
[60:05.60]As the poor woman is no longer here to demonstrate her injuries.
[60:08.84]Believe me.
[60:10.97]Examine it.
[60:12.97]You look it over, the tooth shape is indistinct, ridges and whorls in a crystal cube, but the sense of magic surrounding it is palpable.
[60:21.89]Your grammar is terrible.
[60:25.89]I'm buying it.
[60:27.92]You count out your money, but the merchant catches your hand.
[60:30.86]Please, before you part with your gold, are you sure?
[60:34.80]Carrying such a large item can be most inconvenient.
[60:42.21]How inconvenient.
[60:44.49]It is very big and very heavy.
[60:46.63]Most tiring.
[60:52.20]It's kind of like weighing me down, right?
[60:58.06]And we just got this money.
[61:00.70]Alright, guys.
[61:01.80]Time to decide.
[61:05.53]It's not up to me at this point.
[61:10.13]It's not up to me.
[61:14.45]Get the rock.
[61:16.97]Or... No.
[61:21.71]What do you guys think?
[61:25.89]I wish I could have zapped this fucking guy.
[61:27.59]I would have zapped the shit out of his face.
[61:35.40]Oh, man.
[61:36.06]It started close.
[61:42.22]Thanks a lot, Seasaurus.
[61:44.08]Burn it down.
[61:45.32]If I could, I would.
[61:46.94]Thanks for six months, dude.
[61:49.84]Thank you, Inti, for your subscription.
[61:51.62]Inti.
[61:52.78]Sherlock Shepherd from Shire has subscribed.
[61:55.45]Thanks a lot, dude.
[61:56.79]Luke SubZero for three months.
[61:58.13]Thanks a lot, Luke.
[61:59.87]Welcome back for the third month.
[62:02.89]And then Never Trust a Purple with a bunch of bits.
[62:04.53]Thanks a lot, man.
[62:07.78]When you make more money from the tooth guy than three streams of sorcery.
[62:11.36]I know, right?
[62:11.86]It's crazy.
[62:12.34]Alright, closing it out in... 10 seconds.
[62:22.42]Yeah, it's... I feel like I'm going to get swindle-sweened by this guy.
[62:25.54]I don't think it's going to be worth it.
[62:32.87]To defeat time, Germany, you must understand time.
[62:35.83]What, then, is time?
[62:36.97]If no one asks me, I know what it is.
[62:38.85]If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I don't know.
[62:41.27]You get what St.
[62:42.14]Augustine is saying here, Germany?
[62:43.64]You understand?
[62:46.92]Time is too hard.
[62:47.68]Alright, three, two, one.
[62:51.46]We are not taking the giant fucking rock tooth.
[62:56.61]Thank you for voting.
[62:58.67]This guy's not going to swindle us.
[63:00.87]So do not buy it.
[63:04.47]Then I will keep my money, you tell him.
[63:06.17]He nods.
[63:06.55]Very good.
[63:07.45]This tooth requires the perfect home, no less.
[63:11.47]He just told me that Firefox teeth were worthless, so no.
[63:15.07]You close your pack and your money pouch.
[63:16.65]He shrugs, clearly having already marked you for not a big spender.
[63:21.17]Perhaps I will buy something after all.
[63:25.56]Leave the shop.
[63:26.02]Okay.
[63:27.02]Hmm.
[63:56.08]Let's just make our way around.
[63:59.44]Make our way around.
[64:01.66]You stop in a plaza.
[64:02.70]A woman passes by wearing a wrapped headscarf and carrying what looks like a basket of rocks.
[64:09.77]Greetings.
[64:11.09]I am new in this city.
[64:14.53]No, apparently my tooth healed.
[64:17.09]She nods quickly.
[64:18.65]Then you are welcome, I'm sure.
[64:20.53]She seems in a hurry to move on.
[64:21.73]No doubt her basket is heavy.
[64:25.30]Let me carry that for you.
[64:28.04]Most assuredly not.
[64:29.72]I would not be doing my work if I gave it away.
[64:32.76]She takes a wary step backwards, almost stumbling under her weight.
[64:39.33]I'm not going to tell you.
[64:40.25]Where do you work?
[64:41.59]You continue.
[64:42.85]At the warehouse, of course.
[64:44.35]She waves with her nose at the building with the yellow smoke.
[64:49.33]A warehouse of rocks.
[64:52.03]For now, she answers briskly.
[64:53.49]She pulls her scarf tighter.
[64:55.17]Forgive me, but I must do my work.
[64:57.47]With that, she scurries away down the street and disappears.
[65:03.38]Rocks.
[65:05.74]You take a turn down the narrow alleys of the city, picking your way between sleeping dogs and rubbish heaps, until suddenly a tiny hand reaches out to catch your ankle.
[65:18.14]Knew you were there, see?
[65:19.52]groans a voice.
[65:21.04]Tell you more if you want.
[65:25.48]Uh... Freeze.
[65:29.04]You freeze on the spot, you cannot see the speaker, but the tiny hand seems to emerge from a pile of rotting vegetables.
[65:36.65]What are you doing in there?
[65:38.63]I see you, I see you, the voice replies cheerfully.
[65:41.09]For one gold piece, I'll tell you your fortune.
[65:43.25]How's that?
[65:46.85]I got it, dude.
[65:47.23]I'm fucking swimming in cash.
[65:48.39]Pay a gold piece.
[65:49.83]You toss a gold piece into the pile of garbage and the voice makes a noise which sounds like swallowing.
[65:55.47]Then all falls quiet.
[65:59.42]Wait.
[66:01.04]There, I see it now, the voice declares finally.
[66:03.74]I see a ball of flame lit near the still sleeping cat.
[66:10.06]Hmm.
[66:11.16]A ball of flame lit near the still sleeping cat.
[66:15.27]What does that mean?
[66:16.90]I have no idea.
[66:18.12]But understand this.
[66:19.48]I never run, really, at least.
[66:24.76]So we fucking gonna go burn the cat down?
[66:31.29]Alright, that's what we're doing.
[66:32.71]I'm gonna go back and I'm fucking potting that cat.
[66:37.73]Very, very helpful.
[66:39.51]Very helpful.
[66:40.80]Fucking random guy in the trash.
[66:42.06]Very helpful.
[66:43.74]Back to the tower.
[66:44.86]Let's burn that cat.
[66:49.28]You return to the tower.
[66:50.00]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[66:51.96]Go inside.
[66:52.58]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[66:55.10]It's very gloomy in here.
[66:56.03]All righty, all righty, all righty.
[66:57.37]Up, up, up, up, up.
[66:59.61]And let's adjust the beam.
[67:02.05]This time we're going to point the beam over this way.
[67:12.47]I don't know.
[67:18.07]So the water serpent's in there, but is he there in the past or is he there in the present?
[67:22.27]He's there in the present.
[67:23.99]Okay.
[67:25.75]Yeah, he's there in the past.
[67:27.20]So I'm going to just do... I'm going to move the other one.
[67:33.22]Stuff this one over here for now.
[67:34.58]Because I don't want it.
[67:37.98]We're going to move that other one because we're going to go right from there to the water serpent.
[67:45.22]Mm-hmm.
[67:47.53]So move this.
[67:48.35]Because he's there in the present.
[67:56.10]So move this shit out of the way.
[67:57.46]I mean, I could just put it here.
[68:06.80]I'm going to put it here.
[68:08.72]This seems like a new place with weird statues.
[68:10.97]I'll leave it there.
[68:13.51]Touch the blue crystal, let's make our way back and let's burn that cat.
[68:18.23]A.K.A.
[68:18.73]the Time Serpent.
[68:20.40]He's fucking dead.
[68:25.16]Where's the zapping?
[68:25.98]I demand zapping.
[68:28.80]I came here for zaps.
[68:31.46]Well, the haunt is about to happen.
[68:35.63]All the people you saw earlier have disappeared like sunlight behind a cloud.
[68:39.78]The carved cat.
[68:43.90]Thanks a lot, Xandru.
[68:45.56]Welcome to the channel.
[68:47.56]Alright, you find your way back to the house with the carving of the cat upon its doorstep.
[68:50.50]It is a shattered wreck amongst shattered wrecks.
[68:52.76]More like an architect's sketch than a true building.
[68:57.47]Strike a light.
[68:58.61]You look through your pack for something to catch a light.
[69:00.53]Burn my spellbook!
[69:01.59]What the fuck?
[69:02.21]Why would I burn my spellbook?
[69:04.15]No!
[69:05.81]God!
[69:07.80]Do something else.
[69:09.22]You cannot burn the spell book.
[69:10.44]You'll have to find some other fuel or go without a flame.
[69:14.48]Look at the carving.
[69:15.32]The carving on the doorstep?
[69:16.18]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[69:16.90]Just move on.
[69:17.64]I've already been in here.
[69:21.46]The carving on the doorstep is not as finely detailed as when you saw it made, but is still clearly visible and easy to recognize.
[69:27.09]The cat, now long dead, still sleeps on.
[69:30.01]There is nothing to be found.
[69:31.73]You move away from the building with the carved step.
[69:33.79]Clouds rumble as they roll across the inky sky.
[69:36.09]Soon it'll be dark.
[69:38.64]What the fuck?
[69:44.41]I don't get it.
[70:07.06]No rewinds, but listen, let me explain.
[70:08.90]Let me explain.
[70:09.72]I knew everyone was going to freak out.
[70:10.88]Hold on a second.
[70:11.66]Wait a second.
[70:12.30]Everyone calm down.
[70:14.64]Okay, all rewinding did right there was I was going to go back, go sleep in the fucking tower, and come back again and cast a spell here.
[70:24.32]You understand?
[70:26.04]This wasn't a real rewind.
[70:27.78]I'm just saving myself, walking across the map, and then walking across the map again.
[70:31.82]That's it.
[70:32.47]That's all you need to know.
[70:33.47]Fucking cast Heart of the Cat.
[70:35.44]Burn the fucking whole building down!
[70:36.78]Investigate that shit.
[71:02.08]You go closer, pushing away the dirt with your fingertips to uncover a brilliant green medallion jammed between two stones.
[71:07.85]Perhaps it fell here, or perhaps someone wished to hide it.
[71:12.33]Dig it out.
[71:14.08]So the fucking cat was already dead?
[71:14.80]The cat was just dead in here.
[71:44.73]I demand you add DVD extras.
[71:49.51]Remember when you wouldn't do a re- Yeah, but that- Look, okay.
[71:52.33]This is what I was gonna do.
[71:53.61]I was gonna go like this to the tower and then come all the way back here and just do it again.
[71:59.04]That wasn't a decision.
[72:00.38]That was me.
[72:00.80]I just was gonna do that anyways.
[72:04.52]Alright, let's go fucking burn down the water serpent.
[72:07.35]He's right down here.
[72:11.95]He missed the cat again.
[72:19.64]Good job killing the cat.
[72:20.96]Rewind to the rewind.
[72:22.34]Yeah, it didn't rewind from Flanker.
[72:29.77]That's right.
[72:32.13]Excuses.
[72:32.77]No, it's not an excuse.
[72:34.33]That is a legitimate thing that happened there.
[72:39.09]You leave the city by the old road.
[72:40.19]The sun is almost set and the sky has turned a deep purple.
[72:42.01]This is not a place to linger.
[72:45.74]There he is.
[72:46.74]But where is he?
[72:51.85]You continue to walk along the road, another night begins.
[72:53.46]You should try to find a place to sleep, especially after so much walking on an empty stomach.
[72:57.48]No, we're going on.
[72:58.64]I'm not fucking stopping.
[72:59.70]I have plenty of brimble fruits to eat.
[73:01.12]I'll be alright.
[73:03.44]Rewind to the main hay stream.
[73:06.60]Yeah, it's night time.
[73:07.42]Walk on.
[73:08.74]No, we're not stopping.
[73:12.46]The lake shore.
[73:13.72]He's right here.
[73:14.50]There he is.
[73:18.04]You follow the road as it bends and then descend to the shores of the lake.
[73:22.26]Blow the whistle.
[73:24.36]I have what?
[73:24.80]I have a whistle?
[73:25.42]Blow the whistle.
[73:27.44]You put the whistle to your lips and give it a short, shrill blow.
[73:29.84]The sharp note disappears over the still water.
[73:32.20]Alright, rest here.
[73:37.23]You might as well camp here for the night and make your plans in the morning.
[73:40.35]Laying your pack down on the shore of the lake, you try to respite the wind.
[73:42.99]You've not yet eaten today and if you yet eat something...
[73:47.00]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[73:48.82]You eat an apple, feeling much better for it, then you close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you.
[73:53.34]The night is restless with visions.
[73:55.48]Once more, you're falling into a pit of burning rocks, but every time you land, it is only for the stones to melt and you to tumble further down.
[74:02.63]You are swimming through icy, endless water, but every stroke is only stretching the world beneath you, making it longer.
[74:09.07]Meanwhile, the cold is moving up your veins.
[74:11.97]Through it all, you feel the heat of the Aniland burning should your quest fail.
[74:17.86]Where is this fucking... Yeah, we got a lot of money.
[74:24.97]Sunrise over the lake is beautiful if chilly.
[74:26.65]Now you must work out how to proceed.
[74:29.73]Swim across the lake?
[74:32.99]Oh, fuck!
[74:36.73]Once you dive into the waters of Lake Iqalala, of course all your water-damageable possessions have been ruined.
[74:41.11]I lost my... Thankfully, the pages of your spellbook are protected, but all your soft food has been ruined.
[74:46.58]God damn it.
[74:48.55]Where is this fucking water serpent?
[74:52.21]Do I just have to, like, swim around until he comes and gets me?
[74:57.84]You swim onwards across the surface of the lake.
[74:59.74]It is hard going.
[75:00.48]The air moves a little, still icy, but fresh.
[75:03.92]You rest, lifting your face from the water.
[75:06.20]A dark shadow passes across the water.
[75:10.78]Look up.
[75:12.52]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[75:14.65]Here it comes.
[75:15.80]Looking up, you see a large, winged form passing across the bright sky.
[75:19.43]It flies fast and high.
[75:21.69]A serpent?
[75:23.63]You steal your courage.
[75:24.75]Is this one of the serpents that you were warned would be here in the lake?
[75:27.69]But no.
[75:28.79]This creature does not have the long, twisting tail of a snake.
[75:31.73]The creature circles back above your position.
[75:33.48]It has seen you.
[75:35.10]Oh shit, is it a birdman?
[75:36.86]Oh no, it must be a birdman.
[75:39.54]A birdman?
[75:41.26]Of course, it's a birdman from the peaks of High Zamen.
[75:45.22]beating his way across the water.
[75:47.02]In its arms, you make out something else.
[75:48.46]It seems the Birdman is carrying something.
[75:50.22]No, someone.
[75:51.52]What the fuck is he carrying?
[75:55.50]You stop and stare upwards, trying to make out the figure against the shadowy creature in the bright sky beyond.
[76:00.78]But you can see nothing but that it is a human in shape, with what looks like two long horns rising from its head.
[76:07.50]It seems limp, perhaps even dead.
[76:09.70]The Birdman swoops low, heading towards an eastern island.
[76:15.29]You wait, and after a few long moments, the creature rises once more from the sky.
[76:18.19]It is now empty-handed.
[76:19.23]It flaps away east.
[76:22.13]Eastern island.
[76:25.13]Over here, right?
[76:28.46]Yep.
[76:29.04]We're going over here.
[76:29.70]We're gonna go see what, like, demon he just, like, fucking brought.
[76:34.24]You keep a steady pace as you make your way through the water.
[76:36.04]As the morning moves on, the wind begins to rise near the island.
[76:42.17]Swimming like this is very tiring.
[76:44.05]The mid-afternoon heat floods the landscape.
[76:46.89]You stop briefly, holding up your head and catching your breath.
[76:49.52]Splashing, you accidentally swallow a mouthful of lake water and feel yourself beginning to gag.
[76:55.48]Spit it out.
[76:56.36]Spit it out.
[76:57.10]Spit it out.
[76:58.26]You spit it out and a thick leech the size of your thumb goes flying into the water as well.
[77:03.81]Crush the leech.
[77:04.31]Crush him.
[77:06.09]You reach out of the lake and...
[77:10.37]Why did I do that?
[77:11.49]You reach out and take the leech in your fist and try to squeeze it, but it simply slithers out of your palm and out of the back of your hand where it attaches itself with a thousand tiny teeth.
[77:21.50]Fucking bite it.
[77:22.76]Fucking stop biting the thing.
[77:24.06]You raise the leech to your lips and bite, but the crafty slug quickly jumps.
[77:27.10]A moment later, you feel something constricting in your throat.
[77:29.88]Oh, Jesus.
[77:35.79]It's like down my throat?
[77:42.99]Oh, that's fucking terrifying Reach it like reached into my mouth like down my throat like it's like I'm a muppet and fucking pull it out Spell you open your arms to cast a spell But cannot begin to utter the chants required to bind the stars because of the leech in your mouth You sputter and cough as you try you can feel the creature sucking at the blood from inside your neck Pray the fucking whale pray to the whale
[78:10.71]You close your eyes and raise a prayer to the whale.
[78:13.08]The leech seems to loosen, falling out of your mouth, but then attaching to your tongue.
[78:17.58]You are starting to feel somewhat giddy from the leech's attention.
[78:25.67]Bite through the leech.
[78:27.83]With the leech on your tongue, you were able to bite clean through it.
[78:30.41]It explodes with rich, warm blood in your mouth.
[78:34.57]Swallow it.
[78:39.64]You swallow the blood and the leech, gagging slightly.
[78:43.42]But despite being foul to the taste, it is a somewhat nutritious meal all the same.
[78:48.19]God.
[78:50.55]You feel yourself gaining strength.
[78:52.89]You have swum into sight of a low island.
[78:56.13]You cannot quit swimming without a break.
[78:59.63]That was fucking gross.
[79:02.83]Fucking whale.
[79:04.91]Whale saved me, man.
[79:09.15]Leech stream.
[79:12.03]Thanks a lot, YoungCuz798.
[79:13.67]Welcome.
[79:14.71]Thanks for the sub.
[79:16.78]Thank you, NeverTrustAPurpleFahrenheit616.
[79:18.76]Thank you guys for the bits.
[79:19.64]And Pirate for 100 bits.
[79:22.28]This game is bananas.
[79:28.00]Alright, let's go see this weird demon lord over here.
[79:33.61]There's a demon guy up here.
[79:36.38]You splash through the shallows to the shore.
[79:38.12]The sun has reached its highest point.
[79:40.08]Out of the shade, the air is baking hot on the shore.
[79:43.67]The island is rocky and barren.
[79:45.57]In the center is a rise of land from which a tree grows.
[79:48.39]But one thing is certain.
[79:49.83]This is the island which you saw the bird band visit.
[79:52.29]In the shallow water stands a bell.
[79:56.74]Let's explore.
[79:58.14]You leave the shoreline and head inwards.
[79:59.62]Okay, inland.
[80:00.06]Let's see what the hell was this.
[80:03.70]You circle the shoreline of the island to the north as you climb your way up the rising stones.
[80:08.20]The surfaces are slippery with thick moss and vegetation.
[80:11.94]Suddenly, your easy pace is interrupted by a cry from somewhere inland.
[80:18.63]Listen.
[80:19.93]You stop to listen.
[80:20.71]It is a human voice.
[80:22.01]You make out two words.
[80:24.67]Stay away.
[80:27.67]Keep listening.
[80:30.24]You make no more movements, not wanting to give away your presence.
[80:34.16]Stay away!
[80:34.70]Analandus, stay back!
[80:36.52]Don't come closer!
[80:38.94]You hesitate on the rocks.
[80:40.15]Surely this is a trap.
[80:44.71]Eat some more leeches?
[80:45.79]Let's, like, let's, like, chew on some more leeches.
[80:50.58]Alright, let's, I'm approaching them.
[80:55.19]The voices whimpering and dire cries continue.
[80:58.05]You climb further around the island, a little higher at every step, until you reach the island's peak.
[81:04.31]But as you approach, you realize it is the lip of some kind of pit.
[81:09.54]So this guy's in a pit?
[81:14.34]I mean, Terminal Rumble 5.
[81:16.10]Well, let's see what we can do.
[81:19.41]Let's see what we can cast here.
[81:24.93]Okay, sense danger.
[81:28.79]Obvious, right?
[81:29.43]That's an obvious one.
[81:34.25]I can read minds.
[81:35.71]I don't have the skull cap.
[81:36.59]I could read his mind right now.
[81:37.61]That's too bad.
[81:38.39]That would be pretty helpful.
[81:42.92]Walk is the shield.
[81:47.06]No, I don't want to do shield right now.
[81:49.28]Big.
[81:50.42]Hey, when in doubt, just get fucking huge.
[81:54.39]Just grow in size immensely.
[81:56.09]I think that's pretty much it.
[82:01.81]Or I could do... Fog, summon darkness.
[82:05.23]I can sense darkness here.
[82:07.40]I can create a force field.
[82:10.70]Jig.
[82:11.02]I think it's big.
[82:14.20]I think it's big.
[82:14.96]No matter what the trap, you're gonna trap me, I'll just stomp it.
[82:19.84]Do the big or sense danger.
[82:26.93]Cast a leech.
[82:33.00]Fog.
[82:33.50]Big.
[82:34.62]Alright, let's get a poll here.
[82:37.04]Are we doing sense danger, big, or fog?
[82:46.95]I would do big.
[82:48.09]If it was me.
[82:49.01]But it's not me that's gonna decide.
[82:53.14]Big, Fog, or Seuss.
[83:01.68]And here we go.
[83:11.69]Big, Sense Danger, or Summon Darkness.
[83:18.78]I would read his mind out if that would be.
[83:20.18]It wouldn't even need.
[83:20.76]Oh, big is certainly winning.
[83:23.60]Prank all pizza.
[83:24.52]Yeah.
[83:31.10]Oh, we're getting in there with him.
[83:39.59]It's close.
[83:40.05]It's close enough where I can wait another like 10 seconds.
[83:43.99]Big is currently winning.
[83:46.95]Not very much.
[83:47.73]Not a whole lot.
[83:49.58]Enough to win, that's for sure.
[83:55.69]Ten seconds.
[84:01.09]Summon darkness.
[84:02.29]Detect dark.
[84:03.31]Sense darkness.
[84:04.15]That's what it was.
[84:06.40]Alright.
[84:07.30]Let's get five, four, three, two, one.
[84:12.08]That's it.
[84:12.42]Thank you for voting.
[84:13.00]We're gonna get huge.
[84:14.98]We're gonna get real big.
[84:16.50]Thank you for voting.
[84:18.25]Time to get big.
[84:20.39]Big, big, big.
[84:22.05]When in doubt, grow in size.
[84:25.51]You cast a spell rapidly growing to 18 feet in height.
[84:30.28]Climb to the pit's edge.
[84:32.00]You clamber upwards.
[84:32.82]The voice does not stop its constant warning.
[84:34.66]Between sobs, it calls, Annalander, stay back.
[84:37.94]Come no closer.
[84:38.86]Please stay away.
[84:41.41]Getting in huge.
[84:43.22]You clamber up and over the edge of the stony pit.
[84:45.24]There is a single bare tree at the pit's heart.
[84:48.18]But tied to the tree, head slumped forward, is a sightmaster.
[84:52.47]His eyes are shut, but he still calls out, Stay away!
[84:55.87]Stay away!
[84:57.05]The horns on his helmet are distinctive.
[84:59.17]Of course, this was the creature you saw being carried by the birdman across the lake.
[85:06.37]What is this?
[85:06.89]A bunch of, like, mines?
[85:10.48]I'm kind of scared.
[85:11.14]I'm, like, huge, but that just means, like, bigger pieces of me to... Go to his aid.
[85:15.30]I'm huge.
[85:16.22]I'm big.
[85:17.60]You stride... I gotta do this while the spell is still on.
[85:20.77]You stride forward to his aid.
[85:23.13]The sightmaster stops short in his crying and tilts his head.
[85:27.19]Is that you?
[85:28.31]He breathes.
[85:29.87]Annalenda, is that you?
[85:32.34]You recognize his voice, of course.
[85:34.26]This is none other than the sergeant-at-arms from Anorland, with whom you sparred before you crossed the Wall.
[85:40.38]He has none of his magnificent strength about him now.
[85:45.42]It is I. The Sitemaster shakes his horned helmet in despair.
[85:50.08]You should not have come.
[85:51.73]I tried to shout.
[85:53.07]I hoped you would turn back if you hurt me.
[85:56.67]Why?
[85:56.95]What's the big deal?
[85:59.04]The Sight Master's body racks with a sudden pain.
[86:02.26]Anilander, how I long to look upon your face.
[86:05.97]It would be a great comfort to me.
[86:09.39]Why does he have to keep his eyes closed?
[86:12.39]Zap him?
[86:15.51]What happened?
[86:16.77]You ask horrified.
[86:18.89]The Sight Master shakes his head pitifully.
[86:20.65]His eyes, you notice, are still firmly closed.
[86:23.69]The worst thing that can be done to such as I. He murmurs.
[86:30.24]Give him some leech blood.
[86:31.48]I'm gonna cut him up.
[86:33.30]I'm gonna cut your bonds, you tell him.
[86:34.68]The Sightmaster nods.
[86:35.92]Do so.
[86:36.96]But do so quickly.
[86:38.26]And then run.
[86:38.82]I have kept my eyes shut for seven days.
[86:41.95]You cannot imagine the pain of it.
[86:43.87]I cannot keep them closed for much longer.
[86:47.69]What happens if you open your eyes?
[86:50.95]You perhaps know of the red eyes of Kare.
[86:53.73]If I open these lids, what is behind them will burn everything they see.
[86:58.88]His voice turns to darkness.
[87:00.62]But I am a sight master.
[87:02.86]He continues.
[87:04.26]You hurry over to the man and slice through the bonds that hold his arms against the tree.
[87:08.35]The archmage knew you would come this way.
[87:10.83]He knew you would search the islands on your journey.
[87:13.53]I am not the only trap that awaits.
[87:17.39]What do you know?
[87:18.01]Give me the details.
[87:20.79]He gulps, perhaps about to vomit from pain.
[87:23.92]Beware the other islands.
[87:25.80]For one on one of those waits the most powerful of the seven serpents.
[87:30.48]The Serpent of Time himself.
[87:32.96]Beware.
[87:33.94]He means to kill you.
[87:36.65]Cover his eyes.
[87:38.13]I don't really trust you.
[87:40.81]I'm going to fucking do this for you.
[87:43.61]How do I defeat the Time Serpent?
[87:46.02]The Sightmaster shakes his head.
[87:48.20]I do not think he can be defeated, for he is faster than time itself.
[87:52.93]I heard the Birdman say this.
[87:54.83]Stay away from him, Anor Lander.
[87:57.31]His freed hands are lifting to rub his face.
[88:02.82]I'm gonna, like, block his eyes.
[88:04.72]I'm gonna do, like, the thing that, like, a mother does when she doesn't want her kid to see an R-rated movie.
[88:08.80]You know what I mean?
[88:09.96]Like, here comes the sex scene.
[88:11.48]Like, oh, hold on, Junior.
[88:12.40]You don't want to see this.
[88:14.00]Quickly, you tear a strip of cloth from his cloak and bind it around his eyes.
[88:17.91]But the Sightmaster shakes his head.
[88:20.33]My eyes carry the power of the Under-Earth.
[88:23.23]A mere strip of cloth will do nothing.
[88:25.59]Run, Anor Lander.
[88:26.71]Run.
[88:27.58]Remember, I can see far.
[88:31.68]Help him up.
[88:32.36]I'm gonna help him, Stan.
[88:35.34]You help the weakened figure to his feet.
[88:37.28]Hard to believe this is the same creature who all but bested you with his staff back in the training grounds.
[88:42.34]He is now nothing but a shadow.
[88:44.33]He squeezes your arm, perhaps thinking of similar times.
[88:47.33]Then he grips the tree to support himself.
[88:50.83]Go now.
[88:53.49]What is he fucking?
[88:54.19]Is he the snake?
[88:58.97]Thank you for all that you gave me in my training, you tell him firmly.
[89:02.07]You clasp his shoulder once, then turn and scramble away down the stony gully.
[89:06.52]The sightmaster's gasping breath echoes after you.
[89:09.40]You head back to the shore.
[89:15.52]There's the Serpent of Time.
[89:19.91]Okay.
[89:22.57]How the fuck do you kill the Serpent of Time?
[89:25.89]How do I kill the Turpentine Serpent?
[89:35.59]Go now, he hisses.
[89:36.85]Not go now, he hisses.
[89:40.15]Go now.
[89:42.05]No, that's what he did.
[89:42.71]Alright, are we going to go swim to the time serpent?
[89:47.48]Is that what the deal is?
[89:51.58]You return to the shore of the lake.
[89:52.44]The wind makes the bells shimmer with sound.
[89:54.76]The sight master is desperate.
[89:56.26]Oh, I'm sorry.
[90:00.16]Somebody texted me.
[90:01.87]You return to the shore of the lake.
[90:02.89]The wind makes the... Gradually, you shrink back down to your normal size.
[90:06.06]I was big that whole time.
[90:10.48]I'm just huge.
[90:11.78]He couldn't see.
[90:13.00]That would be so scary, just, like, sloshing over to him and, like, reaching out.
[90:16.92]How did I do all that?
[90:18.74]The Sightmaster's desperate whimpering is carried to you for just a moment on the breeze.
[90:23.02]Ring.
[90:23.16]I'm gonna ring the bell.
[90:23.80]Nothing happens.
[90:24.30]Like, ugh.
[90:26.01]Alright, we're swimming.
[90:28.01]Plunge into the water.
[90:29.97]We're making our way over to the Time Serpent.
[90:36.45]You swim on through the water.
[90:37.55]It is tiring work.
[90:38.43]Slowly, the sun begins to lower in the sky.
[90:40.51]From the island at your back, there is a sudden, violent scream.
[90:44.09]You look up to see a flash of flame rising to the sky.
[90:48.28]The Sightmaster.
[90:50.12]What the fuck?
[90:51.36]It would seem the Sightmaster chose to look down when he opened his eyes.
[91:02.82]He like, nuked the ground.
[91:07.28]He opened his eyes looking down and did a fucking cyclops into the ground and blew up the island.
[91:13.88]Why didn't he look into the sky?
[91:15.36]A short distance ahead, another commotion in the water appears.
[91:22.72]But this one is unavoidable.
[91:24.46]Leaping up from the water, a small school of flying fish are springing into the air and flying towards you.
[91:30.10]God damn it.
[91:31.11]This water is so fucking dangerous.
[91:39.68]What can I do?
[91:40.30]I might have to zap these guys.
[91:45.88]You must defeat your mind to defeat time itself.
[91:50.90]Kin?
[91:51.58]Summon a replica creature.
[91:58.92]Float in the air.
[91:59.70]What if I just float?
[92:00.26]Can I float and just... Fix.
[92:03.48]Cost of fixedness.
[92:04.32]I can make them freeze.
[92:05.21]I don't have the item required for it.
[92:11.34]Nipkos speed.
[92:12.36]I could just blow right by them.
[92:14.59]No, that's a waste.
[92:15.65]I may need that at some point.
[92:22.35]I could do the old razzle dazzle.
[92:24.05]I could razzle dazzle.
[92:33.29]I could put a wall up and just make them hit the wall.
[92:35.89]I'm going to do that.
[92:37.19]Wall.
[92:39.74]Look into the stars as you craft the magic, throwing up an invisible barrier in front of you.
[92:43.57]The fish collide directly into it, one after another, falling into the water where they lie stunned.
[92:49.17]You splash onwards, and the shoal is left behind.
[92:53.07]Shaol, shoal, shaol.
[92:53.97]Yeah, we're gonna make our way down here.
[92:57.90]It worked.
[93:02.82]You try to maintain a regular rhythm as you swim.
[93:04.90]The sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky.
[93:06.54]It will be dark soon.
[93:07.44]You pause for a moment, wiping your eyes.
[93:11.39]I gotta get to shore, man.
[93:12.46]I'm fucking dying.
[93:14.68]Keep going.
[93:17.08]Ah!
[93:18.76]Swimming like this is hard work.
[93:20.22]Night falls and you're exhausted.
[93:21.58]You need to rest.
[93:22.56]Looking up, you sense a suitable formation of stars above you.
[93:26.30]Alright, can I like... Can I like learn how to swim better?
[93:29.32]Zen.
[93:36.93]Oh, I do have a jewel studded medallion.
[93:39.27]It doesn't require any stamina.
[93:41.41]I might do that and just float.
[93:45.90]Big?
[93:46.22]I could get huge and swim.
[93:49.52]No, we're going to do that one.
[93:50.26]We're going to do Zen.
[93:53.70]I just got this stupid item.
[93:54.78]I'm going to use it.
[93:56.32]Hover in the air.
[93:59.26]You spin the starlight into a pattern around you and the medallion begins to glow as you rise gently up into the air.
[94:05.53]Out of the waves, you can rest a little, as well as move yourself much more quickly around.
[94:11.39]Oh, thank God.
[94:14.31]Oh, I got the Gorilla God now?
[94:16.71]That's good.
[94:18.47]Good.
[94:18.81]The Gorilla God, the ape helped a lot.
[94:20.43]Alright, let's go.
[94:21.05]I'm, like, floating.
[94:21.79]I'm not gonna lose any stamina.
[94:23.35]What the fuck?!
[94:24.89]What?!
[94:26.41]You float across the surface of the lake, your weight returns to you, and you settle gradually back down into the ground.
[94:31.60]The moon glares down coldly.
[94:34.15]What the fuck?
[94:35.35]I did that for a purpose to not have to... That's so dumb.
[94:39.41]You rest treading water and catching your breath.
[94:41.65]The water falls strangely calm.
[94:44.11]Swimming becomes easier and you cut quickly through the water.
[94:47.11]It seems too good to be true.
[94:49.33]You notice a thin stream of bubbles off to your left.
[94:54.17]Investigate.
[94:57.55]You swim closer to the bubbles.
[94:58.99]They break around you and underneath you.
[95:01.05]And looking down you see something is rising.
[95:06.04]Oh wait, is this the drugs?
[95:09.86]No, it's not!
[95:10.48]This is not drugs.
[95:11.20]Okay, oil, right?
[95:12.66]Where's the oil?
[95:13.08]How do I throw oil at him?
[95:37.52]Uh... Pop?
[95:47.13]No, I... Do I not have oil?
[95:53.47]I don't think I have oil.
[96:00.51]Zap?
[96:02.57]Wait, no, Zob?
[96:03.43]Ugh.
[96:06.28]Zob.
[96:07.62]Zip.
[96:08.10]Cause teleportation.
[96:10.28]Half smile.
[96:10.82]What a badass.
[96:15.97]I can't do zap right now.
[96:16.91]I have one stamina.
[96:21.81]Oh, sip.
[96:22.81]Sap.
[96:23.55]Cause depression.
[96:24.47]That can't make this guy depressed.
[96:28.56]Might not be able to use it in the water.
[96:32.92]Zob, zob, zob.
[96:33.90]I don't know what zob...
[96:36.29]Alright, we're going to find out what Zob does.
[96:38.97]Zob.
[96:39.83]Cast it.
[96:42.87]You try to bind the enchantment, but you're missing an item that it needs, and so the spell dissipates around you.
[96:48.17]The water serpent is now free of the water and hovers a massive shape against the dark sky.
[96:51.91]It stretches open its wide jaw.
[96:53.69]Throw something in his mouth.
[96:54.87]Perfect.
[96:57.93]You consider the items in your pack for something you could use as a missile.
[97:00.99]Okay, throw the flask of oil.
[97:02.83]This guy's done.
[97:05.32]Throw the flask of oil.
[97:08.88]He's dead.
[97:24.21]You toss the flask of oil into the mouth of the creature and then watch in amazement as it takes effect.
[97:29.81]In mere moments, the serpent breaks into splashes of water which rain down across the surface of the lake.
[97:35.04]The water falls quiet once more.
[97:37.02]You've defeated five of the seven serpents.
[97:39.54]Time to resume your journey.
[97:40.58]Only two more serpents remain at large.
[97:43.34]And we're gonna go kill the fucking time serpent.
[97:47.27]That was so easy.
[97:49.23]Thank god I had the oil.
[97:54.57]Boy, being an adventurer sure is easy.
[98:02.35]Oh, yes, here I come.
[98:03.98]I'm the water serpent.
[98:05.78]I'm so huge and... Did you just throw oil at me?
[98:10.46]Thank you, you've won.
[98:13.20]No, not my ultimate weakness.
[98:16.20]How could you have done this to me?
[98:17.46]Okay, it's cold, it's cold, it's cold.
[98:26.33]I only have three stamina.
[98:29.39]Between the islands.
[98:30.09]I'm gonna be like dead.
[98:31.17]I'm about to fight the Time Serpent.
[98:34.49]You keep a steady stroke as you make your way across the lake's surface.
[98:37.42]The cold night lingers on.
[98:38.98]You cannot go on.
[98:40.38]You are physically exhausted and must rest, but there is no land in sight.
[98:46.36]Meditate.
[98:49.09]Hold on a second, guys.
[98:50.17]I'm fucking exhausted.
[98:51.41]I can't swim anymore.
[98:53.65]I'm gonna meditate in the water.
[98:55.41]Meditate.
[98:57.57]You try to close your eyes and meditate to heal yourself, but the concentration required is impossible while keeping yourself afloat.
[99:03.41]There is nothing else for it.
[99:04.61]You swim on slower now.
[99:07.53]You must find land if you can before your strength gives out.
[99:13.23]Oh, what the fuck?
[99:13.97]Let me get on this island.
[99:16.39]Get me on the island.
[99:17.84]I want to go on this island.
[99:21.20]Oh, by the way, thank you Never Trust a Purple for the 10 bucks.
[99:26.88]Separate wins after all.
[99:27.94]I know, really.
[99:29.76]And thank you to all the other guys coming in with these bits.
[99:31.48]A couple of guys have been throwing 100 bits every so often.
[99:34.42]Thanks a lot, guys.
[99:35.04]Do we have any resubs?
[99:37.05]No, not... No resubs and no subs.
[99:38.81]Just want to make sure I didn't miss anybody.
[99:43.13]Which way am I going to go here?
[99:44.17]Do I have to wrap around this way?
[99:46.07]I'm going to fucking... I'm going to die in the water.
[99:47.71]I'm going to be dead.
[99:49.35]I'm dead.
[99:50.74]Swimming like this is very tiring.
[99:52.04]In the distance, the sun breaks over the horizon.
[99:53.72]You have been awake all night and are weaker for it.
[99:57.98]Physically, you are exhausted.
[99:59.13]You drop to your knees, unable to go on.
[100:01.45]The journey has been too much for you.
[100:04.95]That's how I died.
[100:05.57]I didn't drown.
[100:07.07]The water didn't fill my lungs.
[100:10.55]I didn't get killed by a monster.
[100:13.55]The journey is just way too much for me.
[100:16.67]Can't handle it.
[100:24.80]You dropped to your knees.
[100:25.76]Does that mean I hit the bottom of the ocean?
[100:31.13]Well, okay.
[100:33.81]Thanks a lot, Windmill.
[100:35.49]Windmill WN, thank you for subbing.
[100:39.45]Okay, so I need to get on the... How the fuck am I going to get on this island?
[100:43.94]So I need to just go back to here.
[100:46.72]Look at what I did.
[100:47.20]I bounced back and forth.
[100:49.88]So this is where I started before.
[100:52.26]So I'm going to rewind to here.
[100:55.27]Yeah, okay.
[100:57.31]On the lake, down here.
[101:02.43]Okay, you keep a steady stroke.
[101:04.31]You're gonna die.
[101:05.67]Swim on regardless.
[101:07.77]Near the island.
[101:08.87]We made it.
[101:09.77]Thank fucking God.
[101:12.78]I'm dead.
[101:20.08]I didn't make it to the island.
[101:21.78]I can't physically make it to the island.
[101:24.42]I cannot do it.
[101:25.20]I cannot get here.
[101:26.04]The game's over.
[101:30.50]Spoiler, the lake is only two feet deep.
[101:32.72]Thanks to the textbooks.
[101:36.68]I don't think I can physically do this unless I rewind like 12 minutes.
[101:44.83]Oh, Jesus.
[101:46.53]I'm going to have to pray.
[101:47.09]I got to pray to the gorilla.
[101:49.65]Right here, I need to pray.
[101:55.73]There's no land in sight.
[101:56.73]Okay.
[101:57.25]Just swim on.
[101:58.59]Swim on regardless.
[101:59.49]Pray to the gorilla.
[102:00.41]Please.
[102:01.73]He's not here.
[102:03.43]I'm dead again.
[102:05.55]The gorilla's not with me right now.
[102:06.73]He's gone.
[102:08.92]He's far from me.
[102:09.74]You must wait until they return for further aid.
[102:11.26]I'm dead.
[102:11.72]Again.
[102:15.06]Wait a minute.
[102:15.36]Do I have any, like, fucking potions or anything?
[102:18.38]I have holy water.
[102:21.18]That's the only way.
[102:23.86]That is the only way this is possible.
[102:25.90]I have to drink the holy water.
[102:28.44]Otherwise, I have to rewind to way before this.
[102:31.26]We have to go back like 30 minutes.
[102:46.83]I don't have any blimbleberry potions.
[102:49.93]All I have is holy water.
[102:53.24]Drink God drink your own pets Go to the statue, I'm not gonna be able to make it watch this ready.
[103:02.49]I'll just go to those statues Wait a second hold on am I alive?
[103:14.49]No, I'm dead
[103:20.16]Ugh, thanks!
[103:20.78]Thanks for, like, making, telling me a whole new day went down.
[103:25.76]I just keep drowning.
[103:28.84]I have to drink the holy water.
[103:30.62]That's the only solution.
[103:35.56]Drink up the lake so I don't have to swim.
[103:40.18]Ugh, is there nowhere I can go?
[103:42.50]Is there nothing else I can do besides drinking that extremely important, probably, weapon?
[103:46.46]Weapon?
[103:46.98]Item?
[103:51.78]I can't just like... Why can I not just eat the raw meat?
[104:00.29]Human skull?
[104:00.77]I thought I could eat the human skull.
[104:05.39]Guys, I was so just ready to click this.
[104:07.77]Like, oh yeah, nice!
[104:08.69]I can eat a fucking guy's brain.
[104:10.73]Perfect.
[104:13.82]Drink poison.
[104:18.55]Nope.
[104:19.05]I gotta drink the holy water.
[104:20.85]There's no other option.
[104:21.79]Drink it.
[104:23.11]Drinking holy water seems very wasteful, but you feel quickly much better for it.
[104:27.31]I don't think that even mattered.
[104:28.41]I still can't do it.
[104:32.60]Near the island.
[104:39.04]Yeah, it was the leech.
[104:39.92]The leech is what did it.
[104:41.98]Okay.
[104:42.69]It's gonna be down to two.
[104:43.35]Oh!
[104:44.15]Oh!
[104:47.85]God!
[104:48.93]Swimming like this is very tiring.
[104:50.23]In the distance, the sun breaks over the horizon.
[104:51.85]You've been awake all night and are weaker for it.
[104:53.99]You have to rest, but then a ray of hope appears.
[104:57.05]You have swum within reach of a small island.
[104:59.10]You turn towards the shore.
[105:00.88]Go ashore!
[105:01.60]Alright, we did it.
[105:02.32]We made it.
[105:03.34]Thank God.
[105:07.02]You drag yourself dripping ashore.
[105:08.46]The sky is blue and pink on the shore.
[105:12.51]The island is a pile of rocks, as though dumped from a giant's bucket.
[105:16.59]Near the shoreline is the bell for the ferry.
[105:19.53]Rest and recover.
[105:21.95]You adopt a meditative position and rest.
[105:25.15]The rising winds pull at your hair and cloak.
[105:28.23]Oh, baby.
[105:30.59]The mid-afternoon heat fills the region you stand once more.
[105:35.47]Thank goodness.
[105:37.10]No more holy water.
[105:39.91]What did happen to the boat?
[105:41.61]Did I like burn that thing or something?
[105:43.13]Alright, let's explore.
[105:43.85]We're going to go fight the Time Serpent.
[105:46.19]You clamber up the rocks.
[105:48.40]Inland.
[105:48.76]I have no idea what the Time Serpent's weakness is.
[105:50.94]Not a clue.
[105:53.54]Hold on a second.
[105:54.40]Before I go any further.
[105:56.46]Let's see if there's any clues on the Time Serpent.
[106:05.12]The Time Serpent is on an island.
[106:06.50]Alright, I'm on that island.
[106:09.72]Snutty cats are invisible, just in case you didn't know.
[106:17.04]Ugh.
[106:22.25]The lake is said to be teeming with serpents.
[106:23.95]Yeah, I've already fought three of them here.
[106:30.85]I don't think there's anything I can do.
[106:32.73]I just have to, like, fight them.
[106:34.21]If I even can.
[106:37.11]You head away from the shoreline up the rocky slope of the island.
[106:40.02]Low shrubs grow from the cracks between large stones.
[106:43.08]The wind drops.
[106:44.70]Even the water below seems to stand still.
[106:47.52]This island is quiet, deathly quiet, as though nothing here was alive at all.
[106:55.98]What can I do?
[107:03.65]Zen float for no reason.
[107:08.87]Yaz, cause invisibility.
[107:11.87]That might be useful.
[107:18.24]Soft.
[107:20.50]Oh, I thought that was an S. What's going on here?
[107:30.60]The time serpent's weakness is holy water.
[107:32.31]God, would that be disappointing.
[107:33.47]What is this game doing right now?
[107:36.17]S. S.
[107:38.37]U. N. Create light.
[107:41.17]Sun jewel.
[107:49.90]Res.
[107:50.48]Resurrect the dead.
[107:51.98]Requires holy water.
[107:56.86]Which I just drank for two stamina.
[107:59.97]That's fantastic.
[108:03.49]Sucks.
[108:04.27]S-U-X.
[108:09.66]Hey, Esburito!
[108:11.20]Thanks for the subscription.
[108:12.12]Welcome, dude.
[108:14.18]Time Serpents Rewind.
[108:15.66]I wouldn't be surprised if it was something like that.
[108:17.32]I'm gonna look ahead.
[108:21.57]You creep a little up in stony embankment to try and peer what is ahead.
[108:27.23]You make out a bowl-shaped depression in the ground.
[108:30.31]Some kind of pit.
[108:32.25]At its base lies something.
[108:33.85]A coiled shadow.
[108:35.48]But you cannot make out...
[108:37.17]I don't need to sense danger here.
[108:38.17]There's a time serpent on the island.
[108:39.27]I'm well aware of the time serpent.
[108:50.46]I don't need to sense danger.
[108:51.46]Ah...
[109:03.27]Yes, I'm going to go invisible.
[109:05.29]It's not going to cause any stamina.
[109:06.39]I'm invisibility.
[109:07.17]You put on the pearl ring and cast the enchantment.
[109:10.45]A gray light exudes from the jewel of the ring and it covers you.
[109:12.91]Let's just keep going.
[109:14.19]Keep climbing.
[109:16.13]You continue climbing up a strange dead slope.
[109:17.93]The path turns and then descends into a bowl-shaped pit.
[109:21.15]Hopefully your invisibility would keep you safe from whatever lies within.
[109:25.17]In the pit.
[109:29.45]You crest the edge of the rocky pit and look down.
[109:31.90]The coiled shape you saw earlier is still there, curled up, apparently asleep.
[109:39.42]What is this chakram that I have?
[109:40.88]What is it?
[109:41.48]What is the chakram?
[109:45.32]Like, what is this item?
[109:53.64]Like, treasure?
[109:54.28]Like, I don't get it.
[109:54.96]Fistful of gems?
[109:56.75]Magical items?
[110:01.98]Other items?
[110:02.42]Like, where is it?
[110:09.93]It's a throwing weapon?
[110:13.71]Just fucking YOLO, dude, and throw it?
[110:16.44]Dude just says, fucking throw it, dude.
[110:18.04]YOLO.
[110:20.04]You think that's gonna kill the time serpent?
[110:22.30]Cast a spell.
[110:23.10]Shit.
[110:25.90]You begin to cast a spell, spreading your arms wide, but of course, you only have one arm.
[110:32.22]What?
[110:34.38]What?
[110:35.20]The other was lost on the climb up the hill, don't you remember?
[110:39.76]The dark shape on coils turning its vast jaw in your direction with what is clearly a smile.
[110:46.63]What the fuck?
[110:55.15]Stay still.
[110:57.07]You stay absolutely still, hoping it has not seen you.
[111:01.10]I am death, the serpent says, speaking with grandiose slowness.
[111:06.72]I devour all, destroy all.
[111:11.01]Nothing can withstand me.
[111:13.85]I end all.
[111:16.87]I shall end you.
[111:18.03]I have already done it.
[111:20.69]Welcome to your death.
[111:25.92]Who are you?
[111:27.00]you demand.
[111:28.90]I am finality.
[111:30.10]I am closure.
[111:31.46]I am the cessation of all movement which lies unborn and birth itself.
[111:36.48]You're the serpent of time.
[111:38.04]I know it.
[111:39.20]So I am.
[111:40.96]So I am.
[111:42.70]And all times are as one to me.
[111:45.52]The serpent turns about and seems to yawn.
[111:48.10]It looks straight at you despite your spell of invisibility.
[111:55.87]What if I rewind?
[111:59.27]Should I rewind?
[112:08.80]He said I broke your arm.
[112:09.82]What if I rewind it when I came up here?
[112:11.28]Will that... Rewind.
[112:18.93]Fuck you, Time Serpent.
[112:22.28]You head away from the shoreline up the rocky slope of the island.
[112:24.63]The low shrubs grow from the cracks between large stones.
[112:27.17]The wind drops.
[112:28.67]Even the water below seems to stand still.
[112:30.11]The island's quiet, deathly quiet, as though nothing here was alive at all.
[112:39.50]Keep going.
[112:42.16]You climb up the dread slope.
[112:43.10]The path turns and then descends into a bowl shape.
[112:45.50]Okay.
[112:46.56]Go into the pit.
[112:49.97]What is going on?
[112:53.50]You crest the edge of the rocky pit and look down.
[112:55.52]In the middle of the stones lies a large winged serpent curled into a coil.
[112:59.04]It appears to be sleeping.
[113:03.66]Croucher, he swindles you into you.
[113:08.54]Challenge him to swindle stones?
[113:11.46]If I could, I would.
[113:12.68]Thanks for the 1500 bits though, Croucher.
[113:16.06]And thank you to all the other guys giving bits too.
[113:17.86]Imagine you're 598 with 100.
[113:19.12]No rewind.
[113:20.16]I might have to.
[113:23.41]Alright, we're throwing the chakra at it.
[113:25.53]I'm just gonna like... Alright, throw the chakra at it.
[113:29.73]You reach to your belt for the chakra, only to find it is missing.
[113:31.97]Of course, you lost it several hours ago.
[113:33.53]You remember now.
[113:35.01]What the fuck?
[113:36.67]I'm just gonna creep up on him.
[113:39.13]You creep down the side of the pit, testing each step so as not to dislodge any small stones that might give away your presence.
[113:46.08]But as you put your foot down, you find there's no rock beneath you, only a gap in the land.
[113:50.26]You are up in the air.
[113:52.00]How has that happened?
[113:53.93]A moment later, you land at the foot of the pit.
[113:56.29]The dark shape uncoils, turning its vast jaws toward you with what is clearly a smile.
[114:01.19]Just go for the sword.
[114:04.05]You reach for your sword, but your hand is empty.
[114:05.92]You have no sword, of course.
[114:07.30]How could you have forgotten?
[114:08.34]You lost it in the storm on the lake, just as you lost everything.
[114:12.86]I am death.
[114:14.20]I devour all, destroy all.
[114:15.78]Nothing can withstand me.
[114:16.72]I end all again.
[114:17.56]He's doing it again.
[114:18.46]Who the fuck are you?
[114:19.82]Yeah.
[114:21.41]I am the cessation of all movement which lies unborn in birth itself.
[114:24.23]He's doing the whole shtick again.
[114:26.49]You're the serpent of time.
[114:30.57]He seems to yawn.
[114:31.95]Cast a spell.
[114:33.41]You begin to cast a spell, spreading your arms wide, but of course, you only have one arm.
[114:36.81]It was lost.
[114:37.69]God damn it.
[114:40.63]The serpent's tongue seems to flicker, and a moment later, you are clutching the deep wound in your side that you sustained three hours earlier out on the lake.
[114:49.04]It is still bleeding.
[114:52.06]Fucking run.
[114:52.68]Turn and run.
[114:54.52]You turn to run, but cannot.
[114:55.62]Your legs are buried several rocks deep beneath the ground.
[114:58.68]The serpent seems to almost chuckle.
[115:01.32]All endings must have a moment in which they end, he remarks.
[115:04.99]This is yours.
[115:06.11]No.
[115:07.11]That was yours.
[115:09.55]Attack.
[115:11.21]You move to attack with your fists alone, but somehow you cannot.
[115:13.29]But don't you remember?
[115:14.29]You died yesterday.
[115:15.57]You were eaten while you slept.
[115:19.93]The serpent rolls over and returns to sleep.
[115:22.85]The last thing you see is the hunchback VanCast arriving over the edge of the pit with a sack, ready to take your leg back to his hut with him.
[115:33.86]Where the fuck did he come from?
[115:37.28]Why did he come here?
[115:39.06]Oh, and if I died yesterday... You died well before you met the time serpent.
[115:52.86]I don't think I can kill this guy.
[115:58.21]Fast forward past him.
[116:01.09]VanCast has just been following me around?
[116:05.07]Shit.
[116:05.71]What about like spells here?
[116:06.93]Let's take, hold on.
[116:07.59]Let's go back.
[116:09.99]Cast a spell.
[116:11.07]What are my other options?
[116:17.80]I mean, there's Yaz invisibility.
[116:20.30]He could see through invisibility.
[116:26.18]Zen hovering in the air is... That's not going to do anything.
[116:34.67]Fucking resurrect the dead.
[116:35.73]I can probably, like, resurrect myself.
[116:42.14]I can resurrect myself, probably.
[116:51.42]Don't turn back.
[116:58.84]Get the guy with the laser.
[117:05.36]Will he still be there if I shine this over here?
[117:08.72]No, no, this is not good.
[117:09.80]None of this is good.
[117:10.42]I have to swim across the lake again.
[117:12.62]It's gonna kill me.
[117:14.90]Hold on.
[117:22.09]Fucking jump into the damn water again.
[117:24.97]I'm gonna die before I get over here.
[117:26.43]You guys know that, right?
[117:30.73]Yeah, it's exhausting.
[117:34.74]I wish I had more stamina.
[117:35.88]I have so much money.
[117:36.98]Why can't I buy shit?
[117:45.61]I'm not going to be able to make it back.
[117:47.63]I cannot make it back.
[117:49.43]I'm going to swim here, swim back, and die in the same spot again.
[117:53.11]I have to stop up here, near the statues.
[117:54.76]We've got to go on inland.
[117:55.96]I'm going to die before I get there.
[118:00.63]You've reached the south shore of the lake.
[118:02.35]The magnificent stone harbor is set between two towering statues of sorcerers who reach the sky.
[118:05.92]The Xamon Road.
[118:08.24]You could clamber ashore and the road to High Xamon begins from the harbor.
[118:11.40]You've survived the backlands, but you've not defeated all the seven serpents.
[118:14.98]You could race on or turn back and try to bring down your remaining foes.
[118:20.23]So this is to leave.
[118:21.69]This is to get out of part three.
[118:24.05]But I still have two serpents to kill.
[118:27.92]Oh, God.
[118:30.04]I'm dead.
[118:30.64]I wonder if I leave early, if Lorag will come back.
[118:45.51]Just leave.
[118:46.05]You're right next to the exit.
[118:47.05]You killed five serpents.
[118:48.17]There's been too much violence, too much pain.
[118:50.68]I have an honorable compromise.
[118:51.82]Just walk away.
[118:52.74]Give me your pump, the oil, the gasoline, and the whole compound, and I'll spare your lives.
[118:56.32]Just walk away, and we'll give you a safe passageway in the wasteland.
[118:58.62]Just walk away, and there will be an end to the horror.
[119:03.91]I just want to see if this works.
[119:05.67]It doesn't matter.
[119:06.17]No, it doesn't matter.
[119:06.77]I'm dead.
[119:09.87]Oh, come on.
[119:12.15]You swim onwards across the surface of the lake.
[119:13.73]It's hard going.
[119:14.33]Darkness closes in, and you are very weak.
[119:16.31]You should find a suitable spot to sleep, especially after going all day without food.
[119:19.59]You cannot keep swimming.
[119:20.93]You are weak and must rest.
[119:22.27]You pass close to an island, but it's too rocky to climb ashore.
[119:25.31]You're serious.
[119:28.53]You close your eyes and raise a prayer to the gorilla.
[119:30.82]You feel a great sense of healing entering your bones.
[119:33.24]It will not save you, but it may be enough to get you to shore.
[119:36.64]You've swum into sight of a rocky island, but the shoreline's too rocky and rough to swim ashore.
[119:40.34]You have to keep going.
[119:51.89]God damn it.
[119:53.97]I want to get back on this island near that.
[119:55.75]Why can't I climb?
[119:56.57]I I what I Want to go on this island do I have to teleport to it?
[120:05.21]Oh my god.
[120:06.35]Oh
[120:13.60]I gotta get on shore.
[120:14.60]I can't keep this up.
[120:21.01]I'm dead.
[120:27.06]Oh my god.
[120:27.90]I have to go ashore here.
[120:29.76]Or I'm dead.
[120:33.44]On the shore.
[120:36.38]The center of the island is covered by dead forest.
[120:38.18]Rest and recover.
[120:43.17]You seat yourself by the lake to shore to meditate and recover your strength.
[120:46.14]I got back six stamina.
[120:49.24]Jump back into the water.
[120:50.84]That's all I can do.
[120:52.66]And then get to shore.
[120:57.90]Get me out of here.
[120:59.96]I'm going to have to come back teleporting.
[121:04.14]Near the shore.
[121:05.02]I called this whole thing over here too.
[121:07.86]God damn it.
[121:08.90]I should just leave.
[121:10.98]I had the chance to get out of here.
[121:14.80]Within reach of the shore.
[121:16.54]Get on the shore.
[121:17.52]My goodness.
[121:21.26]On the shore.
[121:23.44]Leave the shore.
[121:24.94]You are suffering badly.
[121:27.74]You turn your eyes away from the lake and head back towards the wastes.
[121:32.86]Alright, wasn't there like a fish shop here?
[121:36.20]I'm going up here and I'm going to turn it back.
[121:37.58]I'm going to buy a bunch of fish.
[121:46.52]The moon rises filling the world with thin stray lights.
[121:49.08]The grey dust drifts across the surface.
[121:50.68]Walk on.
[121:54.02]Yeah, I don't give a shit.
[121:54.94]I have to get out of here.
[121:56.88]Head for the city.
[121:57.82]Back up here.
[121:59.30]You follow the old road.
[122:00.82]Keep going.
[122:01.90]You march on through the darkness.
[122:04.20]Through the darkness we go.
[122:09.58]The road curves gently as you follow the moon sets.
[122:11.70]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[122:13.94]Into the city.
[122:18.30]Okay.
[122:19.38]The tower.
[122:20.69]I think if I touch the crystal, I'm gonna get some stamina here.
[122:25.13]Into the tower.
[122:25.69]I think I can sleep in here, too.
[122:29.25]You stand at the bottom of the tower, listening to the silence sleep here.
[122:32.40]Yes.
[122:34.22]Close my eyes.
[122:35.92]I do not dream.
[122:36.70]A whole three days went by.
[122:38.56]We've barely survived and found no new clues.
[122:46.45]Up.
[122:46.55]Up.
[122:49.32]The brass cylinder waits on the bearing track.
[122:50.94]I touch the blue crystal.
[122:52.12]Give me my stamina, please.
[122:55.72]Okay.
[123:02.56]So if I shine this over here... Oh!
[123:06.95]Here it comes.
[123:07.95]Here it goes.
[123:09.69]No!
[123:11.89]Oh!
[123:14.43]Comcast strikes again.
[123:22.53]Well, that's it.
[123:25.09]We were so close to killing the time serpent.
[123:31.91]I'm going to go live tomorrow.
[123:33.79]I'm also going to stream tomorrow.
[123:35.65]Because I'm going to stream until the problem gets fixed.
[123:39.22]So, have a good rest of your night.
[123:42.94]At least we got a couple hours in before the internet died.
[123:46.87]But, good night.
[123:48.77]Good luck.
[123:49.91]Take care, everybody.
[123:51.17]Have a good one.
[123:52.73]If anybody can even hear me.
