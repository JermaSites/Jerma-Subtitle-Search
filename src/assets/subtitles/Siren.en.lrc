[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.10]But, you know, I got to move on, and I've got to, like, order 600 nuggets.
[00:07.93]Alright, give me Siren.
[00:14.67]This game is going to take, like, 30 hours to beat, and I've got some bad news for you.
[00:19.11]No, I don't.
[00:28.88]Siren.
[00:29.24]This is a PS2 game.
[00:30.32]This is not a PS1 game.
[00:31.26]This game seems interesting enough.
[00:33.20]And we will do face cam for this one.
[00:36.14]I'm probably going to be... What time is it?
[00:37.46]It'll be plenty of time.
[00:42.20]I need a PS2 memory card, though.
[00:43.74]That would be... That would be ideal, wouldn't it?
[00:52.25]You guys just want the face cam.
[00:56.73]Oh, right.
[01:17.32]This is not even correct, but it's like too wide Well, I need to reset this Well this stuff this like filters on this
[01:34.79]Oh, that's why I look so fucking weird.
[01:39.53]No DualShock 2 analog controller inserted.
[01:42.31]Oh, come on.
[01:42.91]I can't use the PS1 controller for this?
[01:44.53]I have to... I didn't think I needed to buy one because I had a DualShock.
[02:01.96]Whatever.
[02:11.81]Buy a PS2 controller in all caps.
[02:13.83]I'm not going to.
[02:15.05]Ever.
[02:15.25]And I'm going to not because I want you to be very angry about it.
[02:29.40]Somebody said you're a millionaire.
[02:30.92]Just buy one.
[02:31.76]Well, that's not true.
[02:36.28]What the fuck was that?
[02:39.66]Stop doing that.
[02:51.31]This is a scary game, by the way.
[02:52.59]As scary as it can be.
[02:54.01]I need to change this to that I'm playing, sorry.
[03:00.82]I don't know.
[03:01.22]Should I call it Sound the Alarm?
[03:03.18]I don't know.
[03:04.36]Sound the Alarm?
[03:06.24]What is this game about?
[03:20.51]Really good game.
[03:21.49]Really bad voice acting.
[03:22.71]Oh, okay.
[03:25.34]Call the br- I'm not.
[03:26.22]Okay.
[03:26.58]How about, like... Sound and whatever.
[03:30.48]Who cares.
[03:32.26]Time to get up for school.
[03:41.83]Okay.
[03:42.89]Well, that should be good.
[03:44.57]So should this at this point.
[03:50.32]Are we gonna get a cutscene?
[03:55.90]Well, this looks like dog shit.
[04:02.27]I might have to do some changes here, because this looks like dog shit.
[04:06.47]Like... Like hard to play.
[04:20.71]This is still wrong.
[04:21.93]It's still squished.
[04:25.51]Oh, I don't care.
[04:26.17]Let's go.
[04:26.51]Alright, this is a siren.
[04:32.39]This is blurry.
[04:40.22]Alright, new game.
[04:42.80]Both headphones.
[04:44.06]Is it loud?
[04:44.72]It's desynced.
[04:45.40]Right, I know.
[04:45.84]I'll fix it.
[04:50.83]That's a lie.
[04:51.27]It's not decent.
[04:56.24]Turn your lights off.
[05:06.66]Subtitles.
[05:09.59]Fuck.
[05:13.03]This looks pretty good on PS2.
[05:24.94]It's like the graphics look actually pretty damn good.
[05:28.80]Alright, I need to turn my lights off.
[05:36.04]What are they doing?
[05:37.98]It's the middle of the night.
[05:50.23]It's the middle of the day, guys.
[06:00.27]He tricked us.
[06:14.34]Son of... Zombie!
[06:25.20]Turn around!
[06:25.80]Is he aiming the gun?
[06:28.70]Why does he have sentience?
[06:32.37]Mission objective, escape from police officer.
[06:36.31]That's all I got right now.
[06:41.31]Okay.
[06:47.36]I did it.
[06:47.68]What?
[06:48.72]Why?
[06:48.96]We gotta see the end of that story.
[06:50.50]No!
[06:51.62]Oh my god, he's coming!
[06:52.66]It's no use!
[06:54.84]Ah!
[06:58.83]Okay, up.
[07:01.71]Where do I go?
[07:05.79]Oh, there he is, there he is, there he is.
[07:10.37]Just run away?
[07:10.99]Is there a, how do I, is there like a, that's a, okay, circle is crouch.
[07:16.37]It's shut tight.
[07:21.17]It's locked.
[07:21.67]I can't like hide in the porta potty?
[07:31.84]Can I get in the car?
[07:36.16]Did this door open?
[07:38.64]Okay, the front door just opens.
[07:40.70]Wait.
[07:41.82]Oh, no.
[07:44.61]Give me the... Key.
[07:47.59]A car key is lying on the table.
[07:48.83]Press triangle button to access the list menu.
[07:58.11]Pick up.
[07:59.45]We picked up the car key.
[08:04.19]Alright, anything else I can grab in here?
[08:06.55]Before a guy comes in and shoots me.
[08:08.46]Copy... There is a copy of the town newsletter on the table.
[08:13.54]Hanuda Community Newsletter.
[08:14.78]It has been added to the archive.
[08:17.82]Oh my god, he's... Lockers line the wall.
[08:22.03]Let's go.
[08:28.27]The door is locked.
[08:28.93]Press triangle at list menu.
[08:37.44]Do I drive the car?
[08:40.16]Used car key.
[08:44.96]Get in the truck.
[08:49.00]Unlock the door and not go in?
[08:50.08]Uh, how do I start the car?
[08:57.94]The ignition is below the steering wheel.
[09:01.58]Insert the key.
[09:05.28]Turn the key to start the engine.
[09:26.64]Letter grade plus one doesn't count.
[09:28.72]Mission accomplished.
[09:31.28]I got into the car.
[09:32.02]I didn't get to drive it.
[09:33.57]We saw a cutscene of the car driving.
[09:36.61]Does not count.
[09:41.36]Day one.
[09:42.24]That was yesterday.
[09:43.40]No, this is day... What are we getting that for?
[09:49.65]24... Excuse me?
[09:56.37]Are you okay?
[09:57.71]Hello?
[09:59.07]Why would you do this?
[09:59.69]The person's trying to shoot you.
[10:01.55]What do I do?
[10:02.76]Call an ambulance?
[10:06.72]An earthquake!
[10:18.18]Car driving?
[10:21.26]I thought- guys, I've been listening to cars blast by driving a hundred fucking miles per hour by this place, and it sounds like that.
[10:41.03]Source filmmaker meme video.
[10:46.37]Yes, I'll save the game.
[10:57.55]Why is it taking so long to save it?
[10:59.47]Is it a fake bar?
[11:04.25]Okay, now we're at- this is two o'clock on day one.
[11:08.21]Like, what, two hours have gone by since I fell down?
[11:20.56]Dead.
[11:20.86]I'm not dead.
[11:25.24]My cam is too big.
[11:30.51]Okay, you know when
[11:47.27]People are linking me images where I look fucking fucked up.
[11:51.67]How do I understand the politician thing?
[11:53.81]Where, like, politicians will be eating, like, ice cream or taking a bite out of, like, a hot dog, and somebody will find the one frame where they're like... You're not safe here.
[12:05.71]Follow me.
[12:22.63]Alright, reach road.
[12:29.11]This red water is now coursing through your veins in place of all the blood you lost.
[12:38.86]You have the water to thank for your recovery.
[12:41.38]The water.
[12:42.86]I know you're still shaking, but you will be better soon.
[12:48.16]I'm so relieved.
[12:51.70]I'm telling you, this is... That's... those faces!
[13:00.78]You're right here.
[13:06.46]You're right here.
[13:10.37]Sightjack.
[13:11.03]Press the L2 button to enter sightjack mode.
[13:14.19]Push the left analog stick in the direction of the character to sightjack, and align it so that the image is visible.
[13:22.23]Press circle X triangle squared to assign it to a particular viewpoint.
[13:30.85]The hold is canceled when the left analog stick is pushed again, but can be recalled by pushing the same button again.
[13:41.18]Okay.
[13:42.14]Sight Jack mode.
[13:44.64]What the fuck is happening?
[13:52.73]What?
[13:59.75]Okay, I put it on X. They are no longer human.
[14:11.08]Be careful.
[14:12.66]It will be a while until you can move freely.
[14:15.08]That's the monster's POV.
[14:17.04]Please, follow me.
[14:20.26]Do you got... Do you got, like, a spear or anything?
[14:24.24]Or maybe, like, a broadsword?
[14:26.06]I'm used to that tonight.
[14:29.65]Anything.
[14:29.97]A weapon?
[14:30.59]A gun?
[14:31.51]I've seen a handgun.
[14:34.39]I know how to walk.
[14:37.47]Go back to the burrito game.
[14:42.31]Running creates more noise than walking, thus attracting the attention of enemies.
[14:45.98]Follow Hisako's instructions and head to Kurowaga.
[14:53.07]This is a very sensitive analog, too.
[14:54.53]I think I'm gonna do tank controls.
[14:55.61]Me too.
[14:56.35]Turn this up a little.
[15:00.50]You can also eavesdrop with Sightjack.
[15:05.80]Sightjack Misako and follow her commands.
[15:26.94]Where is she?
[15:28.38]Which radio station is she on?
[15:35.79]I swear to God, a funny joke would be if, like, all of a sudden, like, your local NBC news station showed up right here.
[15:44.76]I just saw it.
[15:45.30]Where is it?
[15:48.12]Ah, shit!
[15:48.50]Too much!
[15:48.88]Too much!
[15:49.14]Go back!
[16:01.42]I just had it.
[16:06.33]She's gone.
[16:13.35]I'm just gently moving the analog left and right.
[16:21.52]Wait.
[16:22.90]Who's that?
[16:23.44]Is that her?
[16:26.68]That's not her.
[16:28.44]That's not her either.
[16:30.19]Is that her?
[16:37.65]What did she say?
[16:38.65]Where did she go?
[17:05.22]Oh, alright.
[17:10.71]Why am I so out of breath?
[17:11.87]I haven't even moved in like five minutes.
[17:19.41]Are you shitting me?
[17:21.12]I have to tap into the radio waves to find out where they are?
[17:34.77]What the fuck was that?
[17:35.71]There was a noise?
[17:36.35]There was a noise in the room.
[17:58.63]fuck uh there's an issue um because it's like it's like 30 connect games all over the floor I still haven't it could be anywhere whatever it is it could be anywhere
[18:30.52]This is why I don't ever have two headphones in.
[18:32.19]I need to be completely aware of my surroundings.
[18:52.12]How long ago was that stream?
[18:53.48]Was that three months ago?
[18:56.40]Well, because I didn't finish it.
[19:02.71]Alright, let's go.
[19:10.47]That was not three months ago.
[19:11.81]That was like a month and a half ago.
[19:24.20]Don't put on the light.
[19:25.14]They'll find us.
[19:27.02]How do I turn it off?
[19:29.13]Square is flashlight on and off.
[19:31.03]Turning the flashlight off will decrease the chances of being spotted by enemies.
[19:35.23]However, using a gun in the dark will decrease accuracy.
[19:39.31]Oh, that is... Is it just a flashlight or a floodlight?
[19:42.69]Because that is a huge amount of light I don't have.
[19:45.66]I don't know where she went.
[19:48.90]Where'd she go?
[19:50.88]I can't do it alone.
[19:54.10]Will you pull me up?
[19:57.00]Sure.
[19:57.46]Uh... Climb up onto the roof and turn towards Hisako.
[20:02.06]Be careful.
[20:02.51]Pushing the left analogs too far will cause you to climb back down.
[20:04.89]Okay.
[20:08.55]If the companion is a distance away, wait until they are near the appropriate spot.
[20:15.57]That's no.
[20:16.31]That's shout.
[20:26.95]Oh, I have to get up there first.
[20:27.89]Alright, get up!
[20:40.03]Why can't you just climb up?
[20:41.59]I don't know.
[20:43.59]I'm alright.
[20:44.15]Alright, pull up.
[20:54.57]This game looks like it sucks.
[20:56.03]I'm leaving.
[21:00.23]Thanks for coming.
[21:03.95]Alright.
[21:04.23]Press square for more detailed instructions.
[21:07.81]Okay.
[21:09.81]I feel like I need to... This is what it's like when you don't have your glasses on.
[21:16.16]Okay.
[21:22.32]Okay.
[21:26.33]I can't.
[21:27.60]R1 and X is attack.
[21:30.04]So holding R1 and X is attack.
[21:32.08]R1 is draw weapon.
[21:34.24]And it's also lock on if an enemy is within a target area.
[21:38.32]Okay, R1 button plus the left analog stick is directional.
[21:41.02]Okay.
[21:42.94]I can move sideways.
[21:43.92]L2 is enter sightjack mode.
[21:45.84]Alright, I think I'm ready.
[21:51.31]What?
[21:51.51]Let me sightjack.
[21:52.53]What?
[21:55.31]Alright.
[21:56.23]There's more monsters though.
[22:03.53]Is that a sniper?
[22:04.39]Is that a crosshair on my head?
[22:05.71]There's a monster in here.
[22:11.55]Where's she?
[22:20.43]Oh, it's you.
[22:21.69]Oh, it's her.
[22:23.65]Okay.
[22:31.30]What time is it now?
[22:39.92]The crosshair is basically located from where you are compared to whatever you're sightjacking.
[22:45.27]Oh, okay.
[22:46.37]That makes sense.
[22:50.59]Alright, so now this is day one.
[22:56.23]So this is the same time.
[22:59.70]but this is a different person.
[23:01.91]Professor, what is this place?
[23:05.33]Where are we?
[23:06.11]I just don't get it.
[23:09.39]What's going on?
[23:11.93]I told you to wait in the car.
[23:13.55]But what's happening?
[23:16.39]What is this?
[23:17.97]Why is this happening?
[23:19.27]This is exactly why I told you not to come.
[23:21.49]Professor, we need to find the villagers.
[23:24.17]They must be panicking.
[23:27.78]Please shut up.
[23:43.62]From now on you will do exactly as I tell you Until I call you keep your eyes closed and stay still do you understand?
[23:53.15]Oh
[24:02.33]No.
[24:03.43]It's fake.
[24:07.39]They always ask that.
[24:19.00]Is that a real gun?
[24:22.84]There's one time I just wanted to not be.
[24:26.32]Nah, it's part of a costume.
[24:29.92]I did a Wild West thing.
[24:33.56]It's just been in my bag ever since.
[24:34.80]I haven't cleaned out my bag.
[24:35.80]Have you seen my fucking connect room?
[24:43.57]Reach road to Kurawari with Yoriko Anno.
[24:49.37]What the fuck was that?
[24:53.80]Somebody just shot me!
[24:56.96]Somebody just shot me with a gun!
[25:00.16]Did you shoot me?
[25:02.65]Who shot me with a gun?
[25:04.36]What?
[25:25.87]What's going on?
[25:35.31]Alright, I can't... Going back is too dangerous.
[25:47.82]I... Okay, I... It was me!
[25:48.44]It was me!
[25:49.80]Okay, the two...
[26:04.90]I can see the two crosshairs.
[26:11.41]Where is that person?
[26:14.65]Oh, there you are.
[26:16.43]Where are you?
[26:16.95]Alright.
[26:17.67]So you're in... Okay, I'm over there.
[26:23.37]So he's to the right.
[26:26.31]So that's us.
[26:31.00]So he's up like that way.
[26:33.22]He's up there.
[26:35.34]Like, up there.
[26:36.72]How do I get by this?
[26:48.51]Where's the other guy?
[26:52.01]There's two.
[26:58.16]Okay, that's... Alright, I'm going to put you on square.
[27:04.38]So then that's...
[27:06.19]Okay, I've got X and square.

[28:00.49]Okay, let's go.
[28:04.15]That's it.
[28:04.41]I don't have anything else on the radio, right?
[28:05.94]There's only two enemies.
[28:09.29]Okay.
[28:09.53]Okay, stay with me.
[28:14.91]I do have a gun.
[28:26.07]I hate this.
[28:26.63]I don't even know where that is.
[28:41.15]Should I go this way?
[28:41.77]I can't go this way.
[28:47.81]I don't wanna get sniped either.
[28:51.25]You can fall off this edge, don't fucking do that.

[31:29.71]That's you.
[31:33.21]What is this?
[31:38.02]Oh, there's a person on the ground.
[31:39.26]Okay, I get it.
[31:39.94]Go.
[31:40.08]Don't move, don't move, don't move.
[31:53.17]There's something else here.
[32:06.02]Who the hell are you?
[32:06.80]No, it's you.
[32:11.11]I... I... Oh, I hate this.
[32:14.89]I really don't like this.
[32:15.91]There's a radio on the shelf that appears to be broken and only receives static.
[32:35.22]That's it?
[32:38.46]There doesn't appear to be anything useful here.
[32:39.86]There's nothing else in here?
[32:46.78]I can't talk.
[32:48.26]Looks like there's a book right here.
[32:49.46]There's an old album.
[32:52.34]Nothing about it particularly catches your attention.
[32:57.36]Look behind you.
[33:04.35]Okay, I'm not going to lie.
[33:08.03]I thought that right there
[33:14.83]This, I thought, see that black right there?
[33:16.67]I thought that was Kim behind me.
[33:18.71]About to, like, grab me.
[33:25.79]Okay.
[33:31.11]So what am I supposed to do here?
[33:32.00]I have to get out of here, right?
[33:34.46]I can't, can I, wait.
[33:36.30]I have a context menu.
[33:37.86]Hide.
[33:40.82]Hide.
[33:44.62]Pick up.
[33:47.50]You picked up the broken radio.
[33:48.94]I don't know.
[33:50.04]Can I pick up the book?
[33:59.03]I don't think so.
[33:59.51]Alright, I have the radio.
[34:00.65]Alright, come here.
[34:14.76]Alright, let me see where they are.
[34:18.05]He's always up top there.
[34:21.57]You're still on the ground.
[34:22.55]I don't even know where you... You're walking around the shed.
[34:25.15]Can I go down here?
[34:33.47]I need to help you, don't I?
[34:39.55]Oh, no.
[34:39.99]Alright, you can do it.
[34:41.06]Good.

[35:17.23]Which way did they go?
[35:23.58]Did they turn around from here?
[35:24.74]Alright, they're going to be right here.
[35:40.11]Oh, fuck.
[35:41.77]Where are they?
[35:43.94]Where are you?
[35:44.44]What are you doing?
[35:45.70]Don't put your hands up.
[35:47.08]Like that.
[35:47.42]Where are they?
[35:50.38]Shh.
[35:52.14]Where'd you go?
[36:15.66]Where'd you go?
[36:17.55]Where did they go?
[36:19.69]Where are they?
[36:21.99]Where are they?
[36:22.59]Are they behind the shed?
[36:26.69]There you are, there you are.
[36:38.52]Run!
[36:39.75]It's time to run!
[36:41.41]RUN!
[36:42.21]RUN!
[36:43.51]RUN!
[36:44.43]RUN!
[36:45.31]RUN!
[36:46.41]No, don't- this way!
[36:53.35]Hurry up!
[36:56.68]Hello?
[37:01.98]The- Oh shit!
[37:06.56]They tripped!
[37:16.45]Alright.
[37:22.89]Still this person on the bridge with the rifle.
[37:26.50]Alright, where do I need to go, though?
[37:28.18]I need to get in?
[37:31.88]What's the mission?
[37:32.56]Get out of here, right?
[37:35.22]Did I miss something up here?
[37:41.09]Classic snipers.
[37:42.11]I keep running into doors.
[37:49.50]What's the actual mission?
[37:56.28]Reach the road to... Okay, reach the road.
[38:00.43]Alright, so is that right over here?
[38:06.37]Why is this person standing up?
[38:12.73]Where's my friend?
[38:13.45]Oh, fuck.
[38:16.89]Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck.
[38:24.13]I don't even know what that person is.
[38:33.96]Come on.
[38:37.48]Objective.
[38:38.88]Do I have no bullets at all?
[38:41.40]I'm done.
[38:41.70]I have no bullets.
[38:42.72]I'm out.
[38:43.04]Fuck.
[38:48.96]Where did she go?
[38:49.84]What?
[38:53.29]Because this is where we came from.
[38:55.61]Are you here?
[38:56.09]Where are you?
[38:59.33]Oh.
[39:03.05]Is she dead?
[39:10.38]I need to find her signal.
[39:13.48]I'm out of bullets.
[39:22.25]Okay, this is gonna be a really, really odd reference, but he sounds like that old British cartoon character, Mr. Guppy.
[39:31.14]I gotta find her sequence.
[39:32.84]Where is she?
[39:37.66]Is this her?
[39:50.19]Oh, she's just standing in that same spot.
[39:55.18]Oh, damn.
[39:57.38]The sniper.
[39:59.68]Oh, the sniper.
[40:00.80]There was a sniper.
[40:14.02]Reach the row.
[40:14.66]I gotta go wrap around.
[40:17.16]Get the opposite bank.
[40:19.24]I was... I was there.
[40:21.62]I was there!
[40:22.96]Alright, let's just go.
[40:24.56]I know where I'm going.
[40:31.55]Who saw me?
[40:35.33]I got you.
[40:35.87]I got... Okay, you are X.
[40:45.79]You're gonna be square.
[40:48.39]Okay, let's move.
[40:53.23]You're looking more Defoe than Franco.
[40:58.35]Alright.
[41:00.72]Why do I know about Mr. Bluffy?
[41:06.20]Because I know everything.
[41:07.20]Alright.
[41:18.46]Give me a topic.
[41:19.92]Okay, I made it across the bank.
[41:26.20]Come here.
[41:27.54]Now we just gotta go this way.
[41:28.74]I gotta get the radio.
[41:31.62]He knows.
[41:32.50]Give me a topic, throw a topic over here.
[41:39.33]What's the RGB code for Magenta?
[41:43.33]Pound pound, or pound FF0022234FH.
[41:46.49]I'm a shotter.
[42:02.30]That's the hex, idiot.
[42:03.74]Sorry, I was going next level on you.
[42:06.83]Alright, where am I going?
[42:08.25]Alright, this is a... This is a pay attention game.
[42:11.53]I have to pay attention.
[42:12.27]So I'm gonna go... Can I open this?
[42:14.03]Is this like a mailbox?
[42:22.42]What's the hex?
[42:23.54]That's hex, not... Yeah, that's fine.
[42:32.59]What's the RGB?
[42:35.80]Wait a minute!
[42:37.70]The sniper!
[42:48.93]You're not gonna shoot me in the head, are you?
[42:52.11]Professor!
[42:55.92]No!
[43:09.94]So how do I... How do I get up there without them knowing?
[43:22.44]Hey, just got here.
[43:22.98]How long has he been streaming?
[43:23.90]Oh, like three and a half hours, just about.
[43:30.13]So what the... I guess I don't even have to take him out.
[43:32.77]Just keep going.
[43:33.39]Because this... I get around him.
[43:37.21]Right here.
[43:41.12]So, I'm just going to keep moving forward.
[43:52.77]Oh, floppy.
[43:53.97]Floppy, floppy, floppy.
[44:00.29]Why does he know that?
[44:01.14]Just fucking do it.
[44:08.76]Alright, that's good.
[44:09.80]Can I open this door?
[44:10.92]No, it's ported.
[44:12.42]But why?
[44:13.54]Why do I know that?
[44:15.64]Just do.
[44:18.90]Why can't I do the ABCs backwards?
[44:20.95]Z-X-Y-W-Q-T-S-V-U-T-O-P-N-L-O-A-G-H...
[44:35.63]A, B, C, A. Why can I do that shit?
[44:40.89]Sniper, sniper, sniper.
[44:41.79]Sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper.
[44:44.84]Turn the light on.
[44:51.94]Made it.
[44:55.22]Okay, this is where the other guy is.
[45:07.52]Alright, I see... You should... You should do a blobby stream.
[45:17.70]What does that even mean?
[45:22.63]Alright, somebody else is there.
[45:29.21]I wanna... I wanna know where they are.
[45:36.22]You're down.
[45:40.00]You're me.
[45:42.82]Okay.
[45:46.22]And the sniper's still available, but we don't even care about the sniper.
[45:49.68]Let's go.
[45:50.01]There's the radio.
[45:55.17]I remember this.
[45:57.57]I remember this.
[46:00.75]Pick up the radio.
[46:01.43]No, no, no.
[46:03.83]Come here.
[46:09.42]Okay, I have the broken radio.
[46:13.92]I really don't know.
[46:15.34]I have no idea.
[46:16.39]But this is kind of the end of the line here.
[46:24.89]I guess I could go... Can I go around here?
[46:30.48]Is there anywhere else I can go down here?
[46:36.58]What, am I stream going down?
[46:41.47]I guess, okay, I could go down this way.
[46:43.19]There's a guy.
[46:44.03]Where is he?
[46:46.85]He's right next to the tower here.
[46:48.19]No, he's not.
[46:50.47]Where is he?
[46:54.56]I have plenty of ammo.
[46:55.28]In fact, I'm going to reload.
[47:01.34]No, I just want to say F. Oh, alright.
[47:04.40]Alright, there's another guy here.
[47:17.36]Nothing else around here?
[47:20.30]Okay, where is that?
[47:21.06]There you are.
[47:23.24]Alright.
[47:29.18]That brings us back here.
[47:34.55]I haven't been in here yet.
[47:40.97]No, so... Oh, that's the sniper.
[47:47.36]do I get out of here?
[47:50.38]Ooh.
[47:51.60]Drop down here, and then bang right.
[47:54.73]Right?
[47:55.67]Okay.
[47:55.99]Alright, I made it.
[47:58.05]This is the end.
[47:58.57]I need to sneak over here, and then bang right.
[48:10.11]I don't think he sees us.
[48:12.45]This is the road, right?
[48:13.65]This is the
[48:18.26]Who's doing that?
[48:22.12]No, I'm so confused.
[48:25.88]No, I did this already.
[48:28.36]So what the fuck am I supposed to be doing?
[48:29.92]It's like, oh, go to this next area, but where is it?
[48:42.35]This is back where the radio was.
[48:48.99]Oh, bingo.
[48:54.97]I have a map, do I?
[49:01.55]Alright, now we're jumping back to Kyoya.
[49:11.06]It's not a dream.
[49:13.00]Are we winning?
[49:14.80]Um, sort of.
[49:16.91]Okay.
[49:18.39]What do we do now?
[49:20.21]All we can do is wait here until Makino and the others arrive.
[49:26.09]Oh.
[49:26.79]Are you... Is this a place of worship?
[49:30.39]I mean, it kind of looks like one, but it's different from the other ones I've seen.
[49:34.64]It may seem strange, but this is our faith.
[49:42.48]Oh.
[49:43.64]Well, I don't know anything about religion.
[49:44.81]A lot of random O's.
[49:46.53]It must be a sign.
[49:48.19]Oh.
[49:48.43]Outsiders like you don't normally possess the sight.
[49:53.71]Right.
[49:56.44]Stereo.
[49:59.18]Stereo.
[50:00.56]I'll go see what's going on.
[50:02.12]Audio.
[50:02.50]I heard that over there.
[50:08.32]Book of Deliverance, Chaos at the End Times has been added to your archive.
[50:17.52]Okay.
[50:17.78]I won't be reading it, but at least I know it's there.
[50:30.29]A new character.
[50:35.95]We keep getting new.
[50:36.77]I can't even establish any relationship with any of these characters.
[50:41.15]We're seeing too many of them.
[50:51.52]What's this?
[50:55.30]What's this?
[50:58.84]My ears.
[50:59.94]Alright, reach the road.
[51:01.20]I have to just reach the road.
[51:03.58]Head towards the road.
[51:06.08]I don't have anything.
[51:06.82]I don't have any weapons.
[51:09.35]I'm just a guy.
[51:09.97]Alright, wait.
[51:11.53]Everybody seems to have this power, though.
[51:27.65]Who the hell is that?
[51:28.91]Are they gonna fight?
[51:33.97]I thought... I thought he... I think he can still do his thing.
[51:57.58]There's so many people here.
[52:05.95]I said... Some of these people said, I can't hear you.
[52:09.95]Never mind.
[52:10.87]It was just, for a second I thought, why did that kid pan?
[52:13.73]The camera went down.
[52:15.35]And I thought he... I don't know.
[52:23.32]I don't even have a flashlight.
[52:34.90]Oh shit.
[52:35.36]Is there a sniper?
[52:38.62]Alright, somebody's at the end of this bridge.
[52:53.32]No, it's not a bridge.
[52:54.11]What an optical illusion.
[52:55.17]I thought that was a street lamp.
[52:56.53]I think it's safe this way.
[53:06.62]Can I push these over?
[53:08.18]There are gas cylinders here.
[53:10.26]Don't shout.
[53:17.96]Don't go into the light.
[53:18.86]I'm gonna try not to.
[53:19.76]Oh, that's the person with the mallet.
[53:26.26]Okay.
[53:28.88]Just get to the place I need to be.
[53:31.14]And this doesn't open.
[53:34.22]There's a ladder.
[53:44.01]No, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[53:45.65]Stop doing that.
[53:46.45]Open the door?
[53:48.55]The person just... How do I get up?
[53:58.28]I think I have to go up this way.
[54:03.77]The person fell off the roof.
[54:09.33]Okay.
[54:10.75]What should I do?
[54:11.95]Is there anything up here?
[54:12.77]Like a gun or something?
[54:16.95]Okay, they're climbing up here.
[54:22.87]How do I push?
[54:40.40]They're all coming up here at the same time.
[54:42.20]There's too many up here.
[54:57.05]Cast a spell.
[54:58.09]Stimpify.
[55:11.72]Oh my god, that was very funny.
[55:15.45]That was really funny.
[55:18.19]Cast a spell.
[55:21.39]I lost my wand, though.
[55:24.11]So I obviously have to go up there.
[55:25.33]And this is just a runaway... There is a sniper.
[55:29.69]Where are you?
[55:31.88]Where's the sniper?
[55:33.64]The sniper was probably up in the roost.
[55:37.34]That...
[55:38.06]I climbed up.
[55:39.94]You gotta be kidding me.
[55:41.54]An old lady just killed me with a fucking mallet.
[55:43.88]What is that?
[55:44.30]I don't even know what you're holding.
[55:52.98]Okay.
[55:53.70]I gotta go around.
[55:54.45]There was a spoon.
[55:59.87]A spoon could be a mallet.
[56:04.47]It's rounded.
[56:07.42]Somebody has a gun!
[56:18.07]I died of being scared.
[56:29.99]Okay.
[56:31.50]Slow down.
[56:35.59]I almost had him first.
[56:36.97]Okay, there's mallet guy.
[56:40.16]There's guy with gun.
[56:42.22]Old lady with spoon is right here.
[56:47.40]So we've got one.
[57:17.20]I'm pretty certain that I just did the original AT&T jingle.
[57:24.65]Alright, I got you.
[57:26.51]This is what I wanted.
[57:30.01]Now get out.
[57:40.62]When's mom is late- When mom is late with the chicken tendies.
[57:53.81]Why does it- I don't even know what that means.
[58:00.95]Why did I read that?
[58:01.91]I don't- Because I was trying to figure out, I was trying to process in my brain what that meant.
[58:10.40]So I'm reading it out loud to try to figure out what that person was trying to say to me.
[58:19.35]Then why do they have to be always talking to me?
[58:22.83]Oh, great.
[58:25.67]What do you mean no one said that?
[58:27.69]Yes, they did.
[58:29.73]Yes, they did.
[58:30.40]Ugh.
[58:43.00]Did I just seriously get... This is... Are you gonna smash brothers me?
[58:47.47]Really?
[58:47.81]You're gonna like quadruple grab me?
[58:50.65]I got gun.
[58:52.35]I'm dead.
[58:57.87]Go!
[59:02.17]Oh shit.
[59:02.75]Oh shit.
[59:03.10]Oh shit.
[59:03.48]Okay.
[59:04.62]Now it's climb.
[59:05.66]Climb.
[59:06.12]Climb.
[59:07.12]Climb the ladder that is right here somewhere.
[59:14.12]Fucking missed it.
[59:18.72]Where the fuck is this thing?
[59:26.37]Okay, now don't go up there.
[59:36.52]Well, that was fucking completely pointless.
[59:50.30]Why is he still climbing?
[60:04.96]Can I go that way?
[60:06.00]No, I can't.
[60:10.99]This is just for the snipers.
[60:12.59]There's nothing here.
[60:14.19]This doesn't do anything.
[60:17.08]No, this doesn't do anything.
[60:19.76]This is blocked.
[60:22.74]So, this area is blocked.
[60:24.32]I can't do anything here.
[60:31.29]Unless I can go this way.
[60:37.23]I guess, kind of, but I... Does this door, does this door doesn't open?
[60:44.78]Okay, it does open.
[60:45.74]You have to press the X button.
[60:48.72]I thought you had to use the context menu, but you just have to press X.
[61:09.12]I deserved that.
[61:10.80]I thought you had to hit triangle to, like... Alright, so X is used for doors, but triangle is used to do everything else.
[61:19.36]Alright, we're just doing full-on ASMR for the next, like, 15 minutes.
[61:37.01]Eww.
[61:38.13]Did they hear me?
[61:41.94]Alright, I'm gonna do this.
[61:44.08]Do Trump again.
[61:45.32]You're the only person I think that's ever asked me to do that.
[61:49.04]I know I'm doing this so wrong.
[61:51.06]I know that I'm supposed to be sneaking around through here.
[61:55.61]What did- what?
[61:56.55]We held hands and I died.
[61:58.19]Did she break my wrists?
[62:02.77]I don't understand.
[62:09.88]Reach the road.
[62:12.27]I know I'm supposed to be, like, pinning... I just walked over here.
[62:17.54]What the fuck?
[62:19.06]But I know I'm supposed to be sneaking around, and I get it, right?
[62:21.66]But sneaking to where?
[62:23.66]Do I have a map?
[62:32.41]Do I?
[62:32.79]Is this... What is this?
[62:38.79]Next stage.
[62:40.75]What?
[62:43.80]Next stage.
[62:46.12]No.
[62:46.88]This is freaking me out.
[62:52.84]Guide?
[62:53.66]No.
[62:54.06]Mission objective?
[62:54.82]No.
[62:55.20]I don't have a map or anything.
[62:58.57]Maybe I just... Alright, well now... I need to see what's over on the left side.
[63:03.23]I'm gonna get shot.
[63:05.55]I love how I get shot with a gun like twice.
[63:10.88]What a grandmother.
[63:13.45]Bending my wrist kind of hard is enough to kill me.
[63:20.69]Okay, this is what I wanted to do.
[63:21.61]Instead of going this way, I'm gonna go through here, into the door, close the door.
[63:31.22]Can I close it?
[63:33.76]Yeah.
[63:35.14]Okay, now I'm gonna fucking just hide.
[63:37.02]Can I open this?
[63:43.20]There's a refrigerator.
[63:44.16]The refrigerator is not plugged in.
[63:46.34]Plug it in.
[63:51.66]This does not open.
[63:52.48]It doesn't?
[63:53.16]It does.
[63:53.58]Alright, what's in here?
[63:54.34]There's a cassette player.
[63:58.00]It looks like there's some power left in the batteries.
[64:01.20]Use it.
[64:07.46]How do I play it?
[64:08.00]4-1-1.
[64:08.64]0-4-1-1.
[64:18.05]Uh... It's gonna play the tape from the thing.
[64:26.00]Well, I have a code now for something.
[64:28.78]It's a hanging scroll which depicts a scene from a local folk tale.
[64:37.22]What's that behind you on cam?
[64:38.82]Uh, fuckin' an alien.
[64:40.57]And I'm going to be, like, eaten alive on camera.
[64:44.29]Maybe.
[64:46.82]Okay, so I have 0, 4, 1, 1.
[64:48.26]No.
[64:48.48]And then here.
[64:59.95]I can't get in there.
[65:00.65]So I have this, like, 0, 4, 1, 1 frequency.
[65:03.81]What do I do with that frequency?
[65:07.81]I have no clue.
[65:08.49]Okay.
[65:15.50]I thought that was a bug.
[65:24.20]I'm going crazy.
[65:25.71]I thought that was a bug.
[65:26.93]I thought this was an insect coming to fucking sting me.
[65:42.81]There's nobody right here, but where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[65:45.05]I'm just gonna go out here.
[65:56.25]Oh, please.
[65:57.19]How did you see me?
[65:57.77]It's not even... How did you see me?
[66:02.26]Oh, you... Oh, wait, the code!
[66:04.64]Combination lock.
[66:05.30]Remove lock, I know.
[66:07.20]It's 04... There's no time for that now.
[66:08.92]Oh, fuck off.
[66:19.78]Shut the door!
[66:20.16]Shut the door!
[66:21.06]Shut the door on him!
[66:21.68]Shut the door!
[66:22.36]Shut the door on him!
[66:26.00]Okay.
[66:47.77]I know it's... Oh, man.
[66:50.35]I'm so close.
[66:52.01]But so far at the same time.
[66:55.41]There's no time for that now.
[66:57.87]Select is the map?
[67:03.70]But... Why?
[67:05.14]Okay.
[67:14.52]So...
[67:18.17]I have to go down here.
[67:20.18]So we go around to the right, bang a left, and then go.
[67:24.40]I'm just running for it.
[67:29.54]Does it keep me?
[67:32.64]So go around, straight take, bang a left, and then go around the whole thing.
[67:45.02]Left?
[67:46.18]Oh, that guy has the gun.
[67:48.13]Right.
[67:49.35]Okay.
[67:49.67]Alright, alright.
[67:51.91]I gotta do this the right way.
[67:52.87]I gotta do this the right way.
[67:53.95]I've gotta go around and... Alright.
[67:55.97]Yes, you're a very good shot.
[68:00.27]You don't bang a literal left.
[68:02.15]You bang a metaphorical left.
[68:05.17]I have to go around and just sneak around.
[68:10.09]Okay, sneak.
[68:17.41]No, fuck it, just go.
[68:20.79]That's the only time that I know that I'm able to actually do it.
[68:23.83]I just got shot in the fucking head.
[68:27.13]Oh, come on.
[68:27.91]I just... I don't want to sneak... Oh, I don't like... I don't want to fucking crouch around and, like, Metal Gear Solid, like, five enemies.
[68:39.83]Because you sneak so slow.
[68:42.01]You go like you're in slow motion.
[68:45.99]Like, look.
[68:47.52]That's how fast I have to go.
[68:48.76]I got you.
[69:08.71]I got you.
[69:18.49]I can only have four people.
[69:19.97]One, two, three.
[69:21.84]That's all I need right now.
[69:22.86]Guy with a gun.
[69:23.56]I need to watch.
[69:32.86]He's playing a stealth game and he refuses to sneak.
[69:34.78]I didn't know this was a stealth game.
[69:36.00]I thought this was a horror game.
[69:38.93]I don't want to sneak around the scares.
[69:40.49]I want them to scare me.
[69:47.36]Alright.
[69:49.32]I can't go yet.
[69:53.74]Jerva, you put in... Jerva, eject it.
[69:55.81]You put in splinter cell.
[70:09.04]Bang!
[70:09.34]Now that would redeem it.
[70:13.88]That would redeem it for me.
[70:15.08]I think I can go now.
[70:21.45]I move so slow.
[70:34.67]Is there a streamed Splinter Cell game?
[70:36.73]Is the first three amazing?
[70:38.03]No?
[70:38.29]Put them on the list.
[70:39.17]Let's do it.
[70:45.39]Where the f- This is a good game.
[70:55.62]It's fun.
[70:57.42]It's good.
[70:59.43]It is a good game.
[71:00.43]I'm telling you.
[71:01.11]It's actually pretty fun.
[71:07.41]It is.
[71:08.21]I don't... It's interesting mechanics.
[71:10.15]Really interesting mechanics.
[71:11.05]I'm serious.
[71:11.97]I'm not just saying this.
[71:14.27]I'm not just saying this.
[71:14.77]It's a very interesting game.
[71:17.11]Try this one more time.
[71:18.13]The fuckface stat.
[71:23.71]Okay, he has auto-lock on.
[71:26.78]No, I'm going to try to get through.
[71:33.16]Did Jerma run good games?
[71:34.38]We played two great games before this.
[71:37.42]No, shit, that means I'm saying it's not good.
[71:44.08]Whatever.
[71:50.42]Report that guy for aimbotting.
[71:52.86]I'm just gonna go straight, even if he shoots me once.
[71:56.44]Just go.
[71:57.18]Okay, I'm good.
[71:58.38]This is my chance, my chance, my chance.
[71:59.72]Okay, I gotta go left.
[72:09.83]Okay, can I go... so I am going left.
[72:14.94]This is me going left, isn't it?
[72:18.64]How am I still... why is it still saying I'm over there?
[72:23.66]Because I ain't got nowhere to go.
[72:28.37]None of these... is this open?
[72:29.67]Can I, like, get in this?
[72:30.75]Can I do anything here?
[72:32.95]This is all blocked up.
[72:33.97]Nothing up there.
[72:34.81]I can't... I guess I could try to... Don't do it!
[72:38.65]I can... Really?
[72:39.69]I can climb this shit?
[72:42.31]Oh, give me a break.
[72:43.08]I just found it.
[72:45.88]I just found it.
[72:50.26]He's coming up.
[72:50.70]He's coming up.
[72:51.10]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[72:53.06]Hurry.
[72:55.02]I just... I just did it.
[73:10.36]finish the game.
[73:13.14]Alright, I'll finish the tutorial.
[73:17.76]That was too realistic for me, because that was like a dog is actually in your road, like, dying.
[73:24.18]Are you okay?
[73:25.38]Hey, this place is messed up.
[73:28.22]Let's just go to the church together, and then think about what to do.
[73:32.57]The dog's already dead anyway.
[73:43.25]What happened?
[73:51.73]Am I gonna play Blair Witch?
[73:53.33]No, I heard it wasn't very good.
[73:55.93]I heard it was actually pretty bad.
[73:56.91]Is that true?
[73:58.73]That's what I heard.
[74:04.78]That's the... Okay, so, like, new horror games?
[74:07.74]The last, like, two or three new horror games that have come out I've heard have been actually pretty bad.
[74:21.55]Well, you play bad games.
[74:22.63]No, well, like, bad as in, like, the game's just not good.
[74:26.96]It's not like there's nothing there.
[74:28.32]Are you okay?
[74:29.82]Can't you walk a bit more slowly?
[74:31.76]I'm losing you.
[74:34.66]This game is not good.
[74:39.16]And... I'm getting close to turning it off.
[74:46.56]As you've just heard about two minutes ago.
[74:48.86]Do it now.
[75:04.01]It looks like you've been taking good care of my sister.
[75:06.91]Aw, sick!
[75:07.19]Thanks for that.
[75:08.28]Your sister?
[75:08.92]Sick watch!
[75:10.06]Hey!
[75:13.18]Let's go!
[75:14.62]What?
[75:21.42]What happened?
[75:29.14]Alright, we're reaching a lot of roads, okay?
[75:33.44]That's my complaint so far with the game.
[75:35.01]First four missions of the game, reach the road.
[75:37.79]Why can't it be find the... Find the box.
[75:42.31]Climb the tree.
[75:43.29]Reach the road.
[75:48.86]Find an object that'll act as a weapon.
[75:51.80]I can do that.
[75:53.70]Are you coming?
[75:59.36]You coming?
[76:01.69]Let's go.
[76:04.76]I need to find something that'll be a weapon.
[76:07.18]Well, we got the map.
[76:08.42]Alright, cool.
[76:09.85]I don't know.
[76:11.97]This map just looks like an organ.
[76:15.21]Not the piano type.
[76:16.29]People are gonna go... No, like a kidney.
[76:31.36]She keeps bending her neck backwards and looking at me.
[76:42.70]She's got- she's got- look at that nerd neck.
[76:48.87]Where are you?
[76:57.67]Alright, we are right over this way.
[76:59.63]Alright, is it two?
[77:13.21]Okay, that's two.
[77:14.33]There's a Yule right here.
[77:24.92]What is wrong with some people?
[77:27.24]What is wrong with you?
[77:29.24]What is wrong with you?
[77:31.88]What is wrong?
[77:32.82]What is wrong with you?
[77:42.81]Alright, I need a weapon.
[77:47.67]Weapon.
[77:51.37]A poker has been thrust into the remains of the bonfire.
[77:53.50]Looks like it would make a good weapon.
[77:59.36]Got it.
[78:07.71]Okay, you can do that.
[78:09.21]You can... Yeah.
[78:14.31]I'm sorry.
[78:14.85]I need to dislocate your left shoulder.
[78:20.31]Yeah.
[78:22.05]Whoa!
[78:27.72]Oh, I'm making you climb now, too?
[78:29.86]I'm awful.
[78:30.74]I'm sorry.
[78:31.22]Alright, so we gotta go through the iron warehouse.
[78:36.78]Whatever the hell it said.
[78:39.38]Oh, yeah.
[78:39.74]She wasn't the thing.
[78:40.50]That's good.
[78:41.65]Walk slowly, will you?
[78:48.48]Open lock?
[78:50.00]The lock is old and the keyhole is rusted open.
[78:51.93]Probably impossible to open with a key.
[78:53.37]Oh, well then, look at me.
[79:02.22]Look at me.
[79:14.95]What?
[79:15.15]What?
[79:15.31]What?
[79:15.63]What?
[79:15.93]Who is it?
[79:17.85]Oh, that guy's huge.
[79:27.53]Where is she?
[79:30.12]Where is she?
[79:33.08]Where did she go?
[79:44.58]Where's my friend?
[79:45.36]It's Bushido Blade!
[79:53.73]See?
[79:54.25]One hit.
[79:54.61]Two hits.
[79:59.35]Did she just say, look at me?
[80:00.44]I think she did.
[80:09.60]But where are you?
[80:17.81]I don't know where she is.
[80:25.37]Yes, because she lost you.
[80:32.15]Well, just yell back to me.
[80:36.09]How hard is it for you to yell back?
[80:40.86]Now I have to find you.
[80:46.31]Found you.
[80:46.69]Come here.
[80:47.55]Get over here.
[81:20.83]Just try... I was thinking of saying... Oh no, she's shoving vegetables down my throat.
[81:26.32]Like a grandma... That's how the grandma kills you.
[81:30.74]But then I got hit twice.
[81:31.68]And we have to do this again.
[81:38.53]And it was... I know.
[81:39.63]That's why I didn't do it.
[81:40.41]And I buried it.
[81:41.31]Alright, last try.
[81:44.41]Last try and then... What time is it?
[81:47.08]It's been four hours.
[81:48.06]I'll hang up for a while.
[81:52.78]Turn on a light, your face cam's getting too dark.
[81:54.72]Everyone just told me to turn it off.
[82:06.60]Follow me!
[82:10.89]Come here.
[82:13.83]Get over here.
[82:15.59]Where the fuck is she?
[82:24.01]Do I really need to, like, Jack into your brain to see where you went?
[82:40.08]Who the hell is that?
[82:49.53]Okay, you made it.
[82:55.53]Alright.
[83:05.47]Give me the poker.
[83:06.35]Do you need help getting up that?
[83:09.15]We're good.
[83:25.50]Let's go.
[83:26.80]Get past the iron gate.
[83:29.10]Still follow me.
[83:30.20]Make sure you're still behind me.
[83:35.30]The iron gate is up here.
[83:39.40]Follow me still.
[83:40.32]Come on.
[83:47.97]Come on.
[83:56.56]I don't even know if this is the right way to the Iron Gate.
[83:58.78]It might not.
[83:59.22]There it is.
[84:02.20]Iron Gate.
[84:09.39]Come here.
[84:13.15]Where'd you go?
[84:21.66]Oh no, you turned away.
[84:22.42]She's infected now.
[84:27.32]Imagine hitting this two or three times and not figuring this out.
[84:29.72]You have to hit it three times.
[84:34.88]Now she should be right next to me.
[84:37.40]Head towards the settlement so that they have to go... Up there.
[84:48.15]Okay.
[84:49.99]Let's move.
[84:50.39]You're with me, right?
[85:04.25]Oh, by the way, a lot of people were saying to play Soma.
[85:07.33]I don't think that has to even be a Halloween, like, stream.
[85:10.87]I think I could just play that for fun.
[85:14.42]That doesn't have to be, like... Oh no, it's the 31st!
[85:17.82]All horror games turn off!
[85:20.14]No, we can do that.
[85:28.78]Come here.
[85:31.44]It's not that scary.
[85:32.68]I'll show you.
[85:33.56]Look.
[85:34.02]I'll prove it.
[85:36.82]Don't run down here.
[85:40.10]Watch.
[85:41.66]Pay attention.
[85:49.26]Look how scared he is.
[85:53.04]I've heard so much about this guy.
[85:54.60]He's so strong.
[85:55.44]He's really, really powerful.
[85:56.66]That's right, motherfucker.
[85:59.58]Get up here.
[86:15.93]See?
[86:17.39]Now pick that up.
[86:18.33]Pick up his entire iron.
[86:30.42]Hey.
[86:32.06]What's going on?
[86:33.76]Hey!
[86:34.62]Why wouldn't... Okay, that was weird.
[86:45.03]Alright, come over here.
[86:50.57]Right there.
[86:50.91]Alright.
[86:54.28]Alright, stay with me.
[86:57.72]I missed.
[87:01.36]One.
[87:04.41]Two.
[87:04.85]Three.
[87:07.17]We good?
[87:24.33]Wait.
[87:28.57]Hold on.
[87:31.53]She's blind?
[87:37.63]Yeah.
[87:44.12]Oh.
[87:48.30]I'm... I'm... Yeah.
[87:52.96]Is I listening?
[87:55.07]No, people were, like, talking about my LEGO hair for, like, 30 minutes.
[88:13.58]Siren.
[88:15.16]Singing.
[88:39.57]River of blood.
[88:46.45]You with me here?
[88:49.45]So that means, when I swung this and hit her in the face, she just didn't know I was here.
[88:56.48]It appears to be the back gate of the church, but there's a sturdy lock on it.
[89:00.42]Well, where is that sturdy lock?
[89:02.26]Knock it off.
[89:04.10]That's horrible.
[89:09.99]What do you mean she didn't know?
[89:11.53]No, like, she didn't... You know what I'm saying.
[89:24.02]Alright, I think there's a sniper over there.
[89:34.72]Yep, sniper right in front of us.
[89:45.62]I do appreciate, uh, every major Bloodborne boss in the background.
[90:00.57]Stop, it's like such a tiny one.
[90:08.09]Come on!
[90:11.45]Stalling because game sucks.
[90:14.63]No, that's not- I'm not.
[90:16.94]I'm just trying to see where people are.
[90:25.90]It's okay.
[90:49.59]Okay.
[90:51.04]I gotta go this way.
[90:56.42]Where's that sniper?
[90:57.04]He's not looking this way, but I want to see.
[91:01.58]Turn around.
[91:05.04]He's not looking this way.
[91:07.58]Maybe he fell.
[91:08.44]Turn around.
[91:12.94]Doesn't look like it.
[91:15.70]Are you still here?
[91:26.98]Good.
[91:32.83]Yes, I wish to save.
[91:52.97]This is more important to me than the game at the moment.
[91:57.05]Just give me one second so I can listen to it.
[92:12.13]As we await the arrival of the most famous jet setter of the age, here comes his car now.
[92:25.57]Okay.
[92:51.12]Just so everyone knows what I was talking about.
[93:03.23]Another character.
[93:05.61]Reach the road.
[93:12.64]Wait, do I have a... Oh shit, I have like a zoomable shotgun.
[93:26.79]Play the blob.
[93:38.96]I can't even hear what it's doing because I'm not plugged in.
[93:42.90]I don't know what it's doing.
[93:44.95]There's two of them on screen.
[93:46.39]I can't hear it.
[93:46.95]I can only hear the game because my headphones are plugged into the game.
[93:49.33]Where?
[94:22.65]Shoot!
[94:24.39]Okay.
[94:29.66]Alright, I don't- I- I'm done with Mr. Blobby.
[94:40.25]Blame the mouse?
[94:41.25]Blame the mouse?
[94:42.01]There is no mice.
[94:43.77]Just a generic, not official PlayStation 2 controller.
[94:50.24]For a second, I had like a mini heart attack.
[94:53.36]Did you know, like... Did you guys' parents... Did your mother ever put a sticker here that had your name and address on it?
[95:05.09]Like, this is who this belongs to!
[95:08.80]No?
[95:09.12]Oh, that's right.
[95:10.30]I forgot.
[95:11.16]I forgot how old I was.
[95:18.56]This is- this is like 25 years ago.
[95:21.44]This is before the invention of the cell phone.
[95:26.28]Am I- am I- alright, I'm gonna do this again.
[95:35.65]My mom put that sticker on me.
[95:45.40]Gary.
[95:47.33]Look at the snipers.
[95:48.33]Sniper on the train tracks.
[95:56.15]And then... Is that really one sniper?
[96:02.30]There's one sniper that's... You.
[96:04.74]But you're not even, like, in the game.
[96:15.31]Wait.
[96:16.47]They're gonna be right down here.
[96:17.31]How the hell am I gonna control this with the analog?
[96:29.94]I'm not even over there yet.
[96:31.62]Oh shit.
[96:32.08]Who's that?
[96:44.65]Is that me?
[96:46.91]Who's shooting the gun up here?
[96:53.33]What?
[97:14.35]Okay, so they don't... Alright, so they don't come into frame.
[97:19.69]You can't do the static thing.
[97:22.41]Unless they're within a certain range, I guess.
[97:27.43]I know what that guy is, but how am I going to out-snipe that person?
[97:36.76]Maybe sneak?
[97:39.36]This game's making me nauseous.
[97:41.78]Yeah.
[97:42.00]Yeah.
[97:44.98]Yeah.
[97:47.42]Fuck.
[97:48.92]Did I already shoot him?
[97:58.41]Yeah, I... Crap.
[98:02.13]You're right.
[98:14.25]Hey, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, Blobby up to?
[98:26.00]Okay, this- I- don't.. I'm just gonna crouch?
[98:36.00]It's the guy who- it's this person right here, right?
[98:41.00]So am I on this radar?
[98:45.64]Alright, you know what?
[98:46.46]Look at now.
[98:49.68]I can't see that.
[98:51.66]I guess I can.
[98:53.64]Oh, come on.
[98:54.35]This is gonna be fucking impossible.
[99:12.40]I can't see him.
[99:13.34]I have to have to sneak around.
[99:18.62]We demand Mr. Blobby.
[99:26.45]I just X'd out a Blobby window.
[99:28.09]I'm mad at this game.
[99:34.55]He still refuses to sneak.
[100:03.12]Just roll.
[100:04.16]Just line it.
[100:05.28]Just roll.
[100:05.92]Just forward roll.
[100:11.51]I've been seen.
[100:18.57]Should I go the other way?
[100:19.87]Or just run by and duck?
[100:27.14]There's no way you heard me walking from all the way back here.
[100:48.19]Okay, so how am I supposed to go?
[100:52.32]Is the building over here on the left?
[100:56.60]I guess.
[101:00.35]This guy's stream sniping.
[101:01.85]Could be.
[101:25.69]There's somebody in this... There's somebody here, though.
[101:26.99]Where's this other person?
[101:28.15]They're, like, right in here.
[101:28.85]I have to go around.
[101:32.16]Yeah, I can't... I gotta go around.
[101:36.52]But there's somebody in here.
[101:46.10]What was that image?
[101:47.61]Oh my god!
[101:54.37]Stop!
[101:54.85]Get away from my heart!
[102:03.17]Damn it.
[102:11.96]Well, I know where to go.
[102:12.66]I'm gonna try to... Oh, shit.
[102:21.54]Just don't be bad.
[102:25.31]Just don't be bad.
[102:26.69]The two or three words that you say to a streamer, and they'll look over and they'll go... Shut up.
[102:40.32]Shut up, idiot.
[102:41.36]No, I'm doing fine.
[102:43.86]It's just the game controls are all fucked up.
[102:50.74]No, I'm all upset.
[102:53.95]Somebody is right here.
[102:56.52]I'm just going to aim the gun.
[103:05.17]It zoomed in too far.
[103:06.29]How do I pull it out?
[103:13.15]Wait, they were over here last time.
[103:23.06]I'm afraid... There you are.
[103:24.54]Nope.
[103:25.16]Is that just anti-aliasing?
[103:28.56]That was just actual, like, bad aliasing.
[103:36.35]That's not you.
[103:51.24]It's not you.
[103:53.04]It's not you.
[104:00.74]What are they?
[104:16.11]Maybe it's up here.
[104:22.29]Oh, shoot the lock.
[104:33.93]What?
[104:57.78]Why would I be standing this close?
[105:01.02]Shoot the chain.
[105:04.48]Oh no.
[105:05.10]I think your character is smashed.
[105:31.64]Okay, I'm done.
[105:33.07]I'm done playing this one.
[105:35.29]This is fun.
[105:36.25]It was actually pretty fun.
[105:38.43]But after that, I mean, I have to stop.
[105:42.39]I'm done.
[105:47.27]Oh no, what will I do?
[105:51.63]Who's shooting a gun?
[105:55.08]What?
[105:58.48]No, please, please!
[105:59.32]Oh, no!
[106:00.64]The fucking neck wrap!
[106:05.19]God damn it, Spock!
[106:28.77]This old man joke.
[106:30.93]This old man joke gets shot.
[106:33.38]Wait.
[106:33.94]This old man joke gets shot joke isn't funny.
[107:09.07]I got him.
[107:09.41]I killed him.
[107:16.87]I killed the motherfucker.
[107:18.03]He's dead.
[107:32.41]Holy shit.
[107:35.65]Well, they're coming though.
[107:58.86]No, run, run, run.
[108:01.32]Please run.
[108:03.10]Just jump off the edge, please, for the love of God.
[108:05.38]I win.
[108:05.64]I win.
[108:06.02]I beat the game.
[108:08.05]I beat the game.
[108:08.85]I killed the boss.
[108:16.64]I won.
[108:17.62]That was the boss of the level I won.
[108:22.95]Found the reload button.
[108:24.65]Pog.
[108:30.35]Don't ever play this again.
[108:31.87]The game's not bad.
[108:36.82]The game's not bad.
[108:37.80]It's hot.
[108:41.20]I think there's like five of these.
[108:44.66]Are we gonna get to see the credits?
[108:51.98]No.
[109:04.03]You could try the PS3 one.
[109:08.34]It was cool.
[109:09.04]That was a cool effect.
[109:10.26]It was a cool thing.
[109:13.16]So, what am I doing now?
[109:14.10]Uh, that's a really good question.
[109:16.34]I don't really have time to start very much else.
[109:19.60]Uh, we're doing Jackbox tomorrow.
[109:21.94]So, I might just put in, um... No, it's not into the stream.
[109:31.79]Um... I gotta turn the lights on.
[109:38.61]Put on the Kinect?
[109:39.53]No, no way.
[109:41.13]No, I can't get that set up.
[109:51.32]Hang on, back.
[109:55.62]No, uh... No, no Dead Rising.
[109:57.94]I have to, like, download the game.
[110:00.69]And I don't want to start something like that.
[110:02.49]I want to sit down and play Dead Rising for, like, seven to eight hours straight.
[110:07.03]Alright.
[110:09.45]I'm taking that out.
[110:10.19]You know what I'm going to do?
[110:14.21]I kind of... Like, this is going to sound crazy, but I kind of want to, like, play...
[110:20.14]Um, I'm Jeremy Lamy again for, like, a little bit.
[110:23.74]I don't know why.
[110:25.24]There's one, I want to, like, there's one song I want to play.
[110:30.00]I want to, like, play the plane song again.
[110:33.35]I was hearing that in the shower the last, like, few days.
[110:36.19]That, like, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[110:41.83]I was like, I kind of want to, I, like, want to do that right now.
[110:46.36]Plus, PlayStation 2 and the, it's, all this shit is hooked up right now.
[110:51.18]Might as well just do it.
[110:52.40]Because I'm never going to play it again.
[110:56.98]Oh, sorry.
[110:57.46]I just did that to you.
[111:02.41]Where is... Where is I'm General Lemmy?
