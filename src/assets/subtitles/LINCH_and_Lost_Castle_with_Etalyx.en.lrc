[00:57.06]Hi, everybody.
[00:59.28]Welcome to the stream.
[01:02.22]How are you?
[01:04.34]I hope you guys had a great New Year's.
[01:07.38]I know I did.
[01:08.02]Hey, on to 2019, right?
[01:10.71]There's only three days in a year.
[01:17.45]January 1st is the New Year.
[01:19.05]January 2nd is middle time.
[01:21.93]And January 3rd is New Year's Eve.
[01:27.20]We're in the year 68 million, 945 trillion.
[01:29.08]Mm-hmm.
[01:29.48]I'm seeing a lot of, uh... I'm seeing a lot of great memes over here.
[01:40.52]And that's okay.
[01:42.40]This is the only time you're ever gonna be able to use them.
[01:45.41]So I can't wait for the, uh... I can't wait for the stream chat to be, you know, great tonight!
[01:51.69]This is the meme funeral.
[01:58.93]So say your prayers for these jokes.
[02:03.51]Because we're currently grabbing the casket and just lowering them in.
[02:08.54]You know?
[02:21.13]So many people are just... Okay, at this point, you guys are combining them.
[02:24.91]You're just combining them.
[02:29.18]Life is O-W-O.
[02:32.67]I JermaCraft hate pain.
[02:34.25]Like, you can't do that.
[02:36.35]Just because you're allowed to do something doesn't mean you should do it.
[02:39.81]Anyways, we're going to play with the Talics tonight.
[02:42.68]We might have, this might be just like a quick little fun, hey, what's going on, buddy stream.
[02:48.18]We have a couple of potential things to do.
[02:49.94]We want to try this game.
[02:50.74]This game just came out.
[02:52.48]This could be a utter, utter disaster.
[02:55.03]We don't know.
[02:57.08]We haven't even watched anything on it.
[02:58.42]We just saw that it was available, and we're like, okay.
[03:01.54]It's called Lynch.
[03:03.87]If you know, the... If you guys remember when I played Resident Evil 7, where you played that card game versus another person, and if you did something wrong, you got your character gets, like, murdered.
[03:17.43]It's like that.
[03:18.01]Essentially, these guys took that Resident Evil 7 DLC, and now it's a full game.
[03:25.49]I guess.
[03:26.76]We'll see.
[03:28.32]I have no idea.
[03:30.26]But just let me get another minute or so, so me and Etalyx can sync up here.
[03:35.80]And we'll get started.
[03:37.62]Give us a minute.
[04:20.17]There.
[04:20.71]Hey.
[04:21.29]Okay.
[04:22.37]Hey, hey, hey!
[04:23.15]There he is!
[04:24.33]Hey, everybody!
[04:26.19]Wow, I can't believe, uh, Jerma was nice enough to set up a stream PC inside of his basement for me.
[04:32.72]Yeah, I know.
[04:33.58]There's, like, he's been here the whole time.
[04:36.06]It gets a little hot in here because the room's so small, but... Other than that, it's okay.
[04:42.05]Are you, uh, are you, like, in the game?
[04:44.87]I am in the game.
[04:46.53]Oh god, okay.
[04:47.62]Well, here we go.
[04:48.62]Oh, but first of all, hold on a second!
[04:52.10]It was the aliens, thanks for the ten bucks.
[04:53.74]Dying the Jerma mites will have to find a refuge on jermaMars.
[04:58.04]Well, thank you, it was the aliens.
[05:00.08]For your alien-inspired comment.
[05:03.06]And the ten bucks.
[05:04.74]Alright, I'm ready.
[05:08.66]Alright.
[05:09.16]Let's change this over here.
[05:09.86]Alright, so should I... Are you in a game?
[05:13.29]I am in a game.
[05:14.35]Okay.
[05:14.93]Starting now.
[05:18.01]Should we like read the rules first?
[05:20.85]Okay, yeah, let's read.
[05:21.65]Is there a rule book?
[05:22.83]I think there's like a rule book.
[05:23.91]Ah, there is a rule book.
[05:27.27]Wait, this is no server's fun.
[05:29.75]That's because I went to the rule book.
[05:31.42]Oh, well, can't we read the rule book in the server?
[05:35.24]It seems to be like a main menu thing only.
[05:37.26]Okay.
[05:37.78]I'm switching over to the main menu.
[05:41.40]Is it a main menu thing?
[05:43.69]It is.
[05:44.05]There's a rules thing on the main menu.
[05:46.63]Yeah.
[05:46.79]Have you mentioned what this game is?
[05:48.98]Yes, yes.
[05:50.10]I've briefly mentioned what this is.
[05:52.06]Okay.
[05:52.78]Because I have not.
[05:55.42]It's just death cards.
[05:57.82]Yeah.
[05:58.72]If you play the Resident Evil 7 DLC, it's one of the DLCs is you play cards against another person.
[06:05.77]And if you screw up or if something bad happens, the other person, like, dies.
[06:10.95]I guess.
[06:11.27]Yeah.
[06:11.72]It's a pretty low stakes game.
[06:14.33]You know, this is like an early access.
[06:16.11]We just like saw it and like, okay, that's pretty much it.
[06:19.69]Oh, there's rules.
[06:20.41]Okay.
[06:21.33]There are rules.
[06:21.97]There are 36 rules.
[06:23.49]Well, I can't read the rules for more than five seconds.
[06:25.37]No, there's 36 standard cards.
[06:26.89]Alright, so we've got 36 rules and there's two jokers.
[06:29.47]So we're allowed to make two jokes.
[06:33.15]Okay, so, Etalyx, you go ahead and read this because my brain can't do it.
[06:38.72]Alright, there's 22 bonus cards.
[06:40.86]The bonuses go into a separate pocket that's not your hand.
[06:43.60]Okay.
[06:44.44]Some cards are activated immediately.
[06:46.94]You can only hold three of these 22 bonus cards at one time.
[06:50.05]Okay.
[06:51.01]If you exceed that limit, you have to get rid of one.
[06:54.43]So you can hold three bonus cards.
[06:56.98]If you have depression, you lose 10 HP.
[06:59.90]My hand is burning.
[07:00.82]What is my hand is burning?
[07:02.02]What does that mean?
[07:03.66]Okay.
[07:17.56]To avoid damage from the ace, you can beat it with the sixth of matching suit with the Joker or use suitable bonus.
[07:24.32]Okay, dude, this is like a Star Wars scroll of rules here.
[07:28.49]I can't even see the bottom of it.
[07:29.69]It stops being written after a certain point.
[07:33.29]No, it doesn't.
[07:33.95]It keeps going, man.
[07:35.01]It shows you every single rule.
[07:36.79]Oh, my God.
[07:37.59]Hey, and you can scroll.
[07:39.31]Okay, there's a lot of things here.
[07:40.61]Oh, there you go.
[07:41.01]You have to scroll up to go down.
[07:42.93]It's more than 36 rules.
[07:43.43]Okay.
[07:48.08]Is there no tutorial for this game?
[07:50.30]No, you can't do that.
[07:51.22]Look, as long as you steal... I want to get the Leonardo and Michelangelo and you steal a random bonus.
[07:56.61]You know what?
[07:57.99]We didn't figure out how to play this game because... I would have expected it to be so... To be so complicated.
[08:02.91]How about we just do this?
[08:03.65]I'm going to join your game.
[08:05.85]We've got to play at least one just to see what happens.
[08:07.73]Okay, lobby list.
[08:08.88]Do you have a game open?
[08:10.90]I do.
[08:11.82]Okay, good.
[08:13.36]I just created a lobby.
[08:15.06]Let's see if I can find Etalyx' game.
[08:20.57]I'm currently searching.
[08:22.47]Friends only?
[08:23.01]No, I don't think I have that.
[08:24.65]How did you get in last time?
[08:26.79]Literally, your name just popped up.
[08:27.91]Okay.
[08:29.61]Did you make a game?
[08:30.95]I did.
[08:31.55]I am sitting here looking at my hands.
[08:33.24]Okay, hold on.
[08:34.66]Examining this wonderful man who's overseeing the game that we're about to play.
[08:41.96]Did you play with somebody else?
[08:43.58]No, it's just me and the host.
[08:46.22]How did I get into your game last time?
[08:48.27]We did it literally 20 minutes ago.
[08:50.06]Yeah, I know.
[08:52.68]Etalyx, you're quiet on Jerma's dream.
[08:54.74]It's just a quiet little mouse.
[08:56.22]Is this going to be a mouse?
[08:58.76]Okay, there's nobody else playing this game, so I'm going to click on the play button.
[09:04.58]Let's see.
[09:07.33]I'm going to get a League of Legends queue.
[09:13.95]We did test this out before the stream.
[09:15.49]We literally tested this out before the stream.
[09:17.37]Hold on, let me see something.
[09:18.71]Let me raise your volume a little.
[09:21.96]Let me raise your dongers a little, right?
[09:25.26]Are you still just waiting?
[09:26.92]Uh-huh.
[09:28.06]It's just me and the guy.
[09:28.80]He's being very patient with me.
[09:30.84]He's being very patient with you.
[09:32.30]I'm going to restart the game.
[09:34.66]Okay.
[09:36.82]I can try to invite you.
[09:39.02]Hold on.
[09:39.34]If it doesn't work this time, then yeah, we'll try that.

[10:14.95]That's what your face says to me.
[10:18.37]You have someone else's face stitched onto your face.
[10:22.01]Yeah, we both have stitched on faces, apparently.
[10:27.14]He thinks it's really funny.
[10:29.90]He's excited about the game.
[10:31.38]Oh, we got cards.
[10:31.90]Oh, we actually have cards.
[10:33.14]Yes, I've got Donatello, and I'm looking at it, and I kind of want to pick it up.
[10:37.39]I can't even see what this says.
[10:39.92]This looks like somebody has their face in spaghetti sauce.
[10:42.20]He's now on the table.
[10:43.24]Alright, I'm gonna put your face in some spaghetti sauce.
[10:45.53]How do I do it?
[10:47.05]Like this?
[10:49.61]Transfer attack back to no.
[10:51.31]I'm like.
[10:52.41]How do we do this?
[10:53.09]Do I have to put this into your deck?
[10:55.71]I played a Jack.
[10:56.77]What's the Jack?
[10:58.17]It's in the middle of the table now.
[10:59.53]Okay, so that means I'm gonna play like please chiropractic fix my back.
[11:04.47]Oh my god.
[11:06.19]How did you place it?
[11:07.53]I just clicked it again in the middle of the table.
[11:09.91]How does this game?
[11:10.69]How about the king?
[11:15.36]I also got this nice Mutant Ninja Turtle coaster.
[11:19.73]Alright, so you played a Jack.
[11:21.39]I did.
[11:21.75]I'm waiting on you to figure out how to play.
[11:25.25]My Jack is gone, and now I have a queen.
[11:27.29]Okay, that's great.
[11:31.24]I believe he just cut your dick off.
[11:37.22]What?
[11:40.34]How did you do that?
[11:42.09]I believe he just reached down with gardening scissors.
[11:45.11]Alright, well, fuck this.
[11:45.77]Yeah, how about this?
[11:47.65]You're gonna eat some spaghetti.
[11:50.23]Now I was waiting on you.
[11:54.99]What did you just do?
[11:56.03]I don't know, like, vanish the cards.
[11:57.73]I guess I canceled your side.
[11:59.09]I put a queen out.
[12:00.21]Oh, well, let me see this.
[12:02.63]Are we playing war?
[12:03.83]I think this, is this war?
[12:05.85]It's your turn.
[12:07.01]It's my turn again, okay.
[12:10.03]Alright, what is that?
[12:11.52]Is that the please drink out of the faucet?
[12:13.54]Can you see us?
[12:14.86]It is the please drink out of the faucet.
[12:17.18]So I played an 8.
[12:17.74]Let's try to figure out what happens when you play a card.
[12:20.02]Okay, I can't play any cards.
[12:25.68]You just left click it once, then it picks it up.
[12:28.58]Then you look over the middle and left click it one more time.
[12:31.15]That's what I'm trying to do with any of my cards.
[12:33.89]You don't click, hold, and let go.
[12:35.47]You click it, then click it again.
[12:37.41]I'm clicking and letting go over here.
[12:43.95]You're too slow.
[12:45.37]Apparently.
[12:46.47]Look, there you go.
[12:47.59]Now you're going to get kicked in the face.
[12:49.03]I give a six.
[12:52.17]Alright, you've played a six.
[12:53.83]So wait, you can play cards?
[12:57.29]Yeah.
[12:58.43]But like, I'm gonna play... an eight.
[13:02.71]So you can't.
[13:04.82]Uh... Well, now I can't.
[13:06.08]Maybe you have to play like a... Let's see what happens when I play the joker.
[13:09.72]Joker's gotta be wild.
[13:11.24]How come you get... Where do you get all these jokers from?
[13:13.24]And now you get to play a card.
[13:14.34]That means I'm gonna get my back broken again.
[13:16.14]What is T?
[13:17.66]I don't know.
[13:18.62]What does T stand for?
[13:25.03]What are you doing?
[13:25.93]What is that?
[13:26.55]What is up down?
[13:27.73]What does the elevator mean?
[13:28.61]I'm up down on you right now.
[13:31.51]You're about to drink some tea.
[13:33.25]I just transferred that back onto you.
[13:34.79]Hey, I'm rubber and your glue, whatever you say, sticks onto me and then jumps back on you.
[13:37.87]Okay.
[13:43.47]Why do you keep doing that?
[13:44.67]Six cancels that.
[13:46.17]Oh my god.
[13:46.91]Because I'm going to win.
[13:49.25]What is this one?
[13:49.75]This one is like stab the referee.
[13:52.27]I don't want that one.
[13:53.95]That's the king.
[13:55.37]Let's go with shatter your elbow.
[13:58.21]Two of my cards involve either slamming you in the nuts or drilling you in the nuts.
[14:06.55]Either one.
[14:06.89]Okay.
[14:11.06]Alright, so what is that, a nine?
[14:12.22]Is this VR though?
[14:13.50]It seems like it should be though.
[14:15.76]So I played a nine.
[14:17.18]I upped you with a queen.
[14:19.04]Okay, so if you played a queen.
[14:20.43]I played a red queen though.
[14:21.93]So what if I do like a king?
[14:26.89]Try like a red king.
[14:28.79]Uh, okay.
[14:30.25]No, I don't know what just happened.
[14:32.96]It wouldn't let me pick anything up.
[14:36.44]Hmm.
[14:38.86]Didn't read the rules.
[14:42.29]Alright, so what did you play?
[14:43.49]A king?
[14:44.21]I played a red king.
[14:45.75]He's like a skull with a crown on his head.
[14:50.13]Good luck, buddy.
[14:51.09]Maybe I can play a king.
[14:52.46]No.
[14:58.88]Do-do-do.
[15:00.40]Do I have any Queens?
[15:02.96]I can't even pick this up.
[15:05.77]I think it is the way... You're gonna be killed.
[15:08.65]I'm gonna die.
[15:09.53]Your character's definitely dead.
[15:11.03]I couldn't even... I can't even, like, fucking do anything.
[15:15.71]Every time I try to click... Am I dead?
[15:18.84]Your eyes, like, came out of the socket.
[15:20.74]Every time I try to pick up a card, I can't even click the fucking thing.
[15:23.78]Alright, well, here.
[15:24.46]Time to die.
[15:25.66]That's the death card.
[15:29.76]That is a guy with a skeleton with a hood on.
[15:36.57]It is looking that way.
[15:37.49]I think I do have a play, though.
[15:39.61]What's your play?
[15:40.11]I just don't know which... How do you activate your trap cards?
[15:46.64]The bottom ones?
[15:47.10]You just pick them up.
[15:50.02]My turn.
[15:50.52]Did I kill you?
[15:55.51]Are you dead?
[15:56.45]I think I'm still alive.
[15:57.93]I believe I was just hit in the face with a machete.
[15:59.75]Yeah, that was a machete.
[16:01.69]Okay.
[16:02.35]Alright, your turn.
[16:02.87]Um...
[16:07.22]This is so strange.
[16:09.08]Alright, that's a queen.
[16:11.14]You can hit Q to zoom in, by the way.
[16:13.00]Oh, Q zooms in.
[16:14.74]Oh, alright.
[16:15.77]Let's take your heart out.
[16:19.31]Is that really not how this works?
[16:21.85]Like, I can't play a king?
[16:23.71]What about a Jack?
[16:25.94]That's not how this works.
[16:27.98]What about just a regular king?
[16:29.71]There we go, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[16:31.95]I could have played like the Moby King or I could have played like Baratheon King and apparently that was the correct one.
[16:42.45]I have like three bonuses down here.
[16:43.83]I don't know how to use them.
[16:44.85]Alright, I'm gonna like carve you like a cake.
[16:48.14]No.
[16:52.20]What is that?
[16:52.56]Oh, no, you're gonna brand me.
[16:54.70]That's like a brand.
[16:55.70]Oh, okay.
[16:59.94]Why do we have the handsome Jack faces?
[17:02.90]It has to be matching suits, okay.
[17:06.30]But so is that, is this actually like, so that's a, okay, I get it, I get it, I'm starting to understand.
[17:12.97]Alright, well let's go with the turkey look.
[17:18.31]I can like zoom in on you and I can like see you thinking.
[17:23.15]Just pretend we have VR helmets on, yeah.
[17:25.25]Hit Q and zoom into me, this is what you're doing.
[17:29.51]I don't know.
[17:31.53]Which one of these cards am I going to play?
[17:35.83]Oh, wait.
[17:36.27]It's your turn.
[17:36.73]It was my turn?
[17:37.77]I guess you took too long.
[17:39.29]Oh, hold on.
[17:45.33]Oh, we have health.
[17:48.57]What, did you just punch me?
[17:50.11]Did I just get punched?
[17:51.43]You got, we both got, I think he hit both of us.
[17:53.39]Okay, so that, I just like accidentally made us both get hurt.
[17:57.13]You have 49 health, I have 70.
[17:58.67]I'm gonna go with the screaming guy with the arrows.
[18:01.99]Screaming guy with the arrows, that's a diamond.
[18:04.21]I'm gonna try playing an eight.
[18:06.23]No, it's got, I think it's got the same suit.
[18:07.52]It's the same suit, that's the same suit, but it's a lower card.
[18:11.60]So what if I try a king in a different suit?
[18:14.76]No.
[18:15.42]Do I have anything?
[18:17.06]I don't think you can do anything about this.
[18:19.55]Unless you have a bonus card.
[18:20.47]Unless you get a bonus play here, I think I win.
[18:22.61]How do I do bonus?
[18:24.14]Before your turn.
[18:25.32]I think you have to... Well, let's see what happens.
[18:26.66]Do you know?
[18:30.58]My turn.
[18:31.22]Oh, my God.
[18:31.86]That's... Well, now we're both dickless.
[18:38.69]What the fuck, man?
[18:40.37]What...
[18:41.96]Oh my god!
[18:43.80]Now neither of us have anything.
[18:45.08]Okay, well, that's fantastic.
[18:47.82]Is this the train to the eunuch station?
[18:52.14]I have no idea what the hell's going on.
[18:53.68]What the hell is T?
[18:56.99]T, this is not a card in a... That's not a card!
[19:00.61]Alright, that's a king of... I don't even know.
[19:08.29]What does T even stand for?
[19:10.76]What does T stand for?
[19:15.12]I'm so close to death.
[19:17.14]You have 29 health left, yeah.
[19:20.45]He's not happy with you.
[19:21.59]No, he's not.
[19:25.15]Is it my turn?
[19:26.19]It is your turn, yes.
[19:27.81]You can probably play whatever you want.
[19:29.21]Yeah, well, how about the guy eating the turkey leg?
[19:31.23]That looks like a good one.
[19:33.45]Good luck.
[19:35.51]Okay, seven of diamonds?
[19:36.61]I can beat that.
[19:38.15]Eight of diamonds.
[19:39.17]Oh, God.
[19:41.05]Oh, yeah?
[19:43.11]Nine of diamonds.
[19:47.27]Pick up the card.
[19:49.33]Oh, yeah?
[19:50.69]No.
[19:54.07]Oh, yeah?
[19:55.49]I'm waiting.
[19:56.69]Oh, yeah?
[19:58.55]No, that's not what I wanted.
[19:59.63]I want this.
[20:00.43]Nine of diamonds.
[20:02.05]He's going to kill you.
[20:02.73]Nine of diamonds.
[20:04.07]Nine...
[20:06.20]I can't pick it up.
[20:08.30]I was trying so desperately to get this nine of diamonds.
[20:14.54]Alright, now I can pick it up.
[20:16.98]That's a heart.
[20:17.78]What is that, a six?
[20:19.82]That is a six of hearts.
[20:22.60]You're about to get clubbed.
[20:25.64]What else can you play besides same suit?
[20:27.73]I don't know.
[20:28.07]I think we might have done this wrong.
[20:33.61]Yeah, this is just... What is that?
[20:35.60]I just threw a seven of clubs out.
[20:37.68]Why?
[20:38.10]What?
[20:38.42]I think I... I don't know.
[20:39.18]I matched your number in a different suit, probably.
[20:42.54]What?
[20:42.82]What about... That's... I can do eight of clubs, right?
[20:46.70]Wouldn't that follow logic, I think?
[20:48.34]I can't do eight of clubs on your seven of... No, that's not a club.
[20:50.73]That's a... That's a... Whatever the hell that is.
[20:52.55]Can I do king of clubs?
[20:53.11]Oh, wait.
[20:53.37]That's a... That's a spade.
[20:56.63]Sorry.
[20:56.95]Seven of spades.
[20:57.73]Shh.
[20:57.91]I'm gonna die.
[21:00.67]What about any hearts?
[21:01.33]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21:02.69]Is this uno?
[21:03.75]What about the tea of hearts?
[21:04.65]Fuck.
[21:09.41]Yeah, this is how my family plays, you know.
[21:12.65]What about the T of hearts?
[21:15.02]Where does that stand?
[21:15.88]Uh, well, we're gonna go with king.
[21:19.34]I don't think you can do anything about this.
[21:21.06]King of hearts.
[21:22.36]It's uno and war mixed together.
[21:23.88]What happens if I play, like, an eight of hearts?
[21:25.88]Can't.
[21:26.04]You can't go down.
[21:27.35]What if I match a different suit?
[21:29.05]Can't.
[21:29.87]Nope.
[21:31.93]What about T?
[21:33.17]Nope.
[21:34.15]Sorry.
[21:35.19]I can't use my bonuses.
[21:36.57]Sorry, your heart's gonna get ripped out.
[21:41.89]Maybe you can only use a bonus, like, once a game?
[21:43.57]I don't know.
[21:44.35]I don't think I've even used one.
[21:45.54]Alright, you're about to get, like, a... You're about to get a cleaver on your neck.
[21:50.64]Oh, T is 10.
[21:51.60]I'm okay.
[21:59.71]I'm okay.
[22:00.49]I don't even know what that was.
[22:03.67]Okay.
[22:05.51]You just got punched in the face, like, seven times.
[22:10.05]What is that?
[22:10.55]Is that like a toothbrush?
[22:11.55]Yeah.
[22:13.37]I'm gonna stick a toilet bowl cleaner in your mouth.
[22:16.14]Okay, I think I have something I can... No, that's going down.
[22:20.00]Oh my god.
[22:21.08]I'm gonna lose here.
[22:22.46]King?
[22:24.32]What about like a different pile?
[22:27.66]What about tea?
[22:32.67]I don't think I have nothing I can do here.
[22:36.69]No, that's nine, eight.
[22:38.97]I can't go down.
[22:40.05]Well, I'm dead.
[22:43.05]How many more times can I get hit in the head with a hammer before I'm dead?
[22:46.12]I still have the card in my hand.
[22:47.64]You still got 13 health.
[22:49.14]You're hanging on.
[22:50.10]You're doing okay.
[22:51.90]Okay.
[22:54.88]What should I do here?
[22:55.94]How about... Oh, man.
[22:58.18]I kind of just don't want you to play a card here because I want him to rip your heart out of your chest.
[23:04.16]I can't even put it down.
[23:05.04]Where did this just go?
[23:05.88]It's, like, face up, but on your side of the table.
[23:08.20]What is going on?
[23:10.77]You gonna, like, five-finger death punch me?
[23:12.83]I... I can't even use it.
[23:17.51]Uh... Can you do anything?
[23:20.35]Why do they even put a spotlight if you can't, like, put cards out on the table?
[23:25.00]I think we may... I think the game may have broken here.
[23:28.42]Oh, I'm not... I can't say that I'm... Yes, it is.
[23:30.78]I've tried every card.
[23:33.04]You've tried to do every...
[23:37.18]That was it?
[23:38.08]That was it.
[23:38.68]You just get punched in the chest.
[23:40.16]Okay.
[23:41.12]Hey, I can pick this up now.
[23:42.58]You can.
[23:42.94]What did you just do?
[23:44.10]You just switched decks.
[23:44.92]Thanks.
[23:46.22]Nice.
[23:47.14]I'm going to put bugs in your nose.
[23:50.86]What is that?
[23:52.97]How come you can play all your bonuses?
[23:56.59]That's not fair.
[23:57.19]You can play the emoji movie and I can't?
[23:59.91]It said I could steal one of your bonuses, but I don't seem to have one.
[24:04.13]Okay.
[24:04.27]Okay.
[24:06.74]I feel like that's going to kill me.
[24:07.78]That's a nine of diamonds?
[24:12.14]Okay.
[24:14.42]Take care of this.
[24:17.96]What is this even going to do?
[24:18.84]Does he stab you in the chest with arrows?
[24:22.77]Uh... It looks like a cat of nine tails flail or something like that.
[24:28.65]We're about to find out.
[24:33.57]Yeah, I can't pick up any of my cards, so...
[24:36.70]Bring it on.
[24:37.92]Get him.
[24:39.52]No, it's just your turn.
[24:40.84]Why?
[24:41.02]I don't know.
[24:42.98]Because we didn't read the rules.
[24:44.60]Yeah, we didn't read the rules.
[24:48.08]Rise of the... Okay, we're going to play the Terminator card.
[24:50.68]Rise of the Machines.
[24:52.06]What the fuck does that mean?
[24:53.87]Rise of the Machines.
[24:57.29]Alright.
[24:57.63]How about this?
[25:00.11]Can you do anything?
[25:03.21]I heal.
[25:03.79]I tried to heal before.
[25:04.77]It didn't work.
[25:08.18]I'm not allowed to play a single card.
[25:09.62]That's just Terminator Guy Fieri.
[25:12.83]Why do they even turn the spotlight on if you can't play a card?
[25:17.63]Yeah, well get ready to fucking go to Flavortown!
[25:20.49]Alright, what's he gonna do?
[25:26.20]He just stabbed you in the stomach, alright.
[25:27.70]Yeah.
[25:28.36]I'm not gonna be able to eat for a few days, but other than that I'm okay.
[25:31.84]13, 13, we both have 13s.
[25:34.54]Deal with tea.
[25:37.39]I don't even know what T stands for.
[25:38.89]T stands for 10.
[25:39.73]Good luck.
[25:41.01]I can't, like, wait, can I, like, split this?
[25:43.61]This isn't blackjack.
[25:44.67]How can I split this?
[25:46.35]I can't.
[25:49.18]I can't do it.
[25:51.90]Uh, I don't have any hearts.
[25:53.28]The only heart I actually, yeah, I do.
[25:55.44]I have this one.
[25:56.98]Oh, please, come on.
[25:57.98]T of hearts.
[25:58.90]I can't put the king of hearts on here.
[26:04.61]Are we just so blatantly missing the rules here?
[26:14.31]You're dead.
[26:17.51]Can't say I'm particularly satisfied with the manner in which you died.
[26:20.45]Hold on.
[26:20.79]Hold on a second.
[26:24.68]There are 36 cards.
[26:25.42]I'm going back to the rules.
[26:26.38]There are 36 standard cards.
[26:30.86]You have 30 seconds on every turn.
[26:33.80]When you pick up a card, it will be blocked for one turn.
[26:36.64]Okay.
[26:36.94]Whatever that means.
[26:37.60]A joker does six damage.
[26:42.47]So that's just free damage.
[26:44.11]Players act in turn no matter if they pick up the card or dodge.
[26:48.79]Transfer avoid damage from the ace.
[26:51.82]I mean, you know, here's the problem here.
[26:54.30]This is not telling us the rules.
[26:55.86]This is telling us like bullet points of things that can possibly happen in the game.
[27:00.32]This is like if you played this game in real life, this is how you would play it in the video game.
[27:05.04]Like it assumes you already know how to play the game.
[27:07.41]This is just the interpretation.
[27:09.05]This assumes that you already know how to play this game.
[27:12.61]When you pick up a card, it will be blocked for one turn.
[27:14.47]If you play it with a Joker, it deals 6 damage.
[27:17.39]Press the space button.
[27:19.99]Okay, I guess we can just read these.
[27:21.69]Okay, plus 20, plus 20 is HP.
[27:24.08]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:24.70]You transfer attack.
[27:25.64]These are bonuses.
[27:29.02]What about the actual cards down here?
[27:32.18]It seems that they do a proportional amount of hit points.
[27:35.52]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[27:36.92]T is A's, by the way.
[27:39.64]Trump.
[27:40.04]We're doing this totally wrong.
[27:40.84]Probably T for Trump.
[27:43.18]We're doing this totally wrong.
[27:44.30]These are just percentages.
[27:46.38]I don't think the suits matter at all.
[27:47.84]Alright, T is apparently the strongest thing in the game.
[27:52.91]Yeah.
[27:54.27]That's what I was just saying.
[27:55.03]It's like Ace.
[27:55.85]T for Trump.
[27:56.59]Trump card.
[27:57.69]Oh, okay.
[27:58.95]But Joker beats anything.
[28:02.47]So that's actually the Trump card.
[28:03.97]So I don't know.
[28:05.15]So Joker sits in between.
[28:07.29]The Joker is not J. Where is the actual Joker?
[28:10.13]I think it just says Joker on it.
[28:11.39]It's at the top of the list.
[28:15.08]Alright, let's do this one more time and then never play this game again.
[28:21.46]This is the important part.
[28:22.70]Give me the important part.
[28:24.82]To avoid damage from the ace, which is the T card, you can beat it with the sixth of matching suit.
[28:32.46]So if you have a six that matches it, you can avoid the ace damage.
[28:35.62]Okay.
[28:37.06]So six is like counter aces.
[28:40.27]Oh, okay.
[28:42.87]And Joker also does.
[28:49.71]Use mouse three to shoot the other guy.
[28:52.47]What?
[28:54.87]Are you in a game?
[28:57.07]I will be in a second.
[28:57.87]Alright, make that game.
[28:58.63]Let's get it going.
[28:59.73]Let's do it, baby.
[29:03.89]There's one part I want to find out.
[29:08.02]So T stands for, like, you lose.
[29:10.90]It's ace.
[29:14.06]Yeah, but you can counter it with a six or a joker, which I think is considered dodging.
[29:17.96]Oh, God, my internet's dying.
[29:20.31]no what why is my internet dying welcome to comcast ladies and gentlemen we just started what the what my internet is actually down to like a thousand k up that's what what is going on right now this is so stupid uh well let's hope this passes I am in a lobby
[29:48.22]to actually try to play this game for real.
[29:50.58]Dude, I'm getting as close to 0k up as I can possibly.
[29:53.77]I've dropped 10,000 frames.
[29:59.29]It's almost as high as chat can count.
[30:04.79]Okay, I think we're evening out here.
[30:06.87]We passed, we threw the storm.
[30:09.21]We might be.
[30:10.81]Okay, lobby list.
[30:11.73]I might have to restart the game.
[30:14.18]Yeah, I have to exit the game to find a new lobby.
[30:18.16]Wait, you're not in my lobby?
[30:19.34]Is this someone else?
[30:20.22]You're playing against somebody else right now.
[30:21.86]Oh, interesting.
[30:23.46]Yeah, I am currently playing against an unknown person.
[30:27.55]Well, abandon that.
[30:28.35]Give that guy the free win.
[30:30.11]Just go into the game of Hearthstone and I concede.
[30:33.55]Boom!
[30:34.21]And you get to go up a rank.
[30:35.29]That guy's going to be so happy about that.
[30:36.43]Alright, you out?
[30:40.99]Yeah, I am out.
[30:42.59]Make another one.
[30:44.72]That's not you.
[30:46.32]Alright, will do.
[30:46.95]This guy's currently scrimming right now.
[30:53.13]It's the only other person playing this game, I'm pretty sure.
[30:56.57]Hey, look!
[30:57.35]Oh god, finally, a game!
[30:58.57]I can play a game!
[30:59.35]I'm in a game.
[31:01.01]Go ahead and try.
[31:01.77]I'm coming.
[31:03.23]Come on.
[31:04.81]It's gonna be so funny though, since there's no name tags.
[31:08.31]Like, if there were four people playing this game, like, we could be in other people's games and think that we're playing against each other, but we're not.
[31:17.71]I can't even join your fucking game.
[31:19.87]Is somebody in that game?
[31:23.09]No, my game's empty right now.
[31:24.75]Oh, my God.
[31:26.51]Just join me through friends list.
[31:29.92]Hold on.
[31:30.40]Let me... No, it's my client.
[31:33.42]Hold on a second.
[31:35.04]It's my guy.
[31:35.46]I got a client on the phone.
[31:36.30]Oh, your client?
[31:38.38]Tell them to reschedule.
[31:40.68]Hopefully nobody else is playing this video game right now.
[31:44.63]I think someone else is in the game again.
[31:47.73]God damn it.
[31:50.91]Hey, you ready to go play Lost Castle?
[31:54.76]That sounds like fun tonight.
[31:56.38]We can do this one more time.
[31:59.14]You start the lobby and I'll join off you.
[32:01.20]Do I have to do anything special?
[32:04.80]You literally just push play.
[32:05.96]Alright, I'm in a game.
[32:10.87]What does this guy have, like, tattoos?
[32:14.95]Uh, that is a sword fight between a bunny rabbit and a dinosaur.
[32:19.66]He has, like, somebody's name on his arm.
[32:23.10]He's got the, uh, he's got the Infinity War guy, Thanos' hands.
[32:28.00]Alright.
[32:28.32]Joker.
[32:29.22]Is this me?
[32:29.58]Is that you?
[32:30.04]Is this you?
[32:30.81]Look up and, yeah, okay, that, that... I gotta, look, I don't know if that's you or not.
[32:36.09]What do you mean?
[32:36.57]How am I supposed to determine if that is you?
[32:38.63]It's just a guy shaking his head.
[32:40.63]It's me.
[32:40.83]Okay, I'm ready.
[32:42.16]It's me.
[32:42.94]Alright, you ready?
[32:43.54]Okay, so let's play this game.
[32:45.04]I'm ready, and who gets to go first?
[32:46.84]You do.
[32:48.66]I do.
[32:51.88]That is the eight.
[32:53.23]That is the eight of spades.
[32:55.67]Eight of spades.
[32:56.67]Eight of spades.
[32:57.17]Also known as needle drill in your shoulder.
[33:00.90]He's getting ready.
[33:01.58]He's got a gun.
[33:02.76]Why is he holding a gun?
[33:04.74]He has a gun.
[33:05.84]I don't think I can do anything here.
[33:10.80]No, I can't.
[33:11.96]So basically, since you played a higher card, I think, you dodged my attack.
[33:16.93]So now you're attacking me.
[33:18.33]Now I am attacking you.
[33:19.37]So the number is a percentage of my health.
[33:22.25]I get you.
[33:22.69]Okay.
[33:22.99]So what is this one?
[33:25.03]It looks like a rose or something.
[33:26.53]Try to dodge that one, buddy.
[33:29.74]So, Queen of Hearts.
[33:32.86]That's like the third highest damaging card, I think.
[33:35.34]What if I try playing... Do I want to dodge that?
[33:41.92]I don't know.
[33:43.09]So, if you play a higher... I thought you couldn't play anything unless it was the same suit.
[33:49.15]I don't know.
[33:52.33]I think he's... He just dropped something.
[33:55.35]Did he like... Did he just throw like a... Wait a minute!
[34:03.33]Okay.
[34:04.75]I thought he was pointing that at me.
[34:09.08]I might be bleeding.
[34:10.26]I'm in need of some triage right now.
[34:12.86]Where did I get shot?
[34:14.24]That only did 25% damage to you.
[34:16.50]Only 20?
[34:16.84]That's so much.
[34:18.24]He shot you in the head.
[34:19.59]Alright, so that's 25% damage, right?
[34:24.41]I guess, if that's how much your queen did.
[34:26.55]So I'm going to have to... Let's see.
[34:28.59]That's of hearts.
[34:29.71]No, that's diamonds.
[34:36.22]I don't think I can do anything about this.
[34:41.38]No.
[34:42.72]I can't do anything about this, so I'm going to skip the turn.
[34:47.66]He shot me, too.
[34:48.58]I wasn't even looking.
[34:49.60]He shot me.
[34:50.54]We both got shot with a gun.
[34:52.36]You got shot in the stomach, though.
[34:54.90]That only did 15 damage to you.
[34:56.70]No, I just skipped my turn.
[34:57.98]My thumb was on... My thumb was on Spade's part.
[35:01.16]Hey, thanks, man.
[35:03.69]Have another queen.
[35:04.73]Oh my god.
[35:05.53]My thumb is sitting on spacebar and I just fat fingered it.
[35:09.09]That's fine.
[35:10.39]You're gonna get swordmaned.
[35:12.71]No, I'm not.
[35:13.07]You're just dodging.
[35:16.68]Anything you play right now doesn't actually hurt me.
[35:19.20]It just cancels the card that I have.
[35:20.44]Why does that look like it's trying to go on top?
[35:24.24]Ah, shit.
[35:28.02]He's waiting.
[35:31.01]And he's going... I don't know.
[35:32.17]He's got roses.
[35:34.16]I can't... This is just a game where he has the gun.
[35:43.81]Okay.
[35:46.01]And you still only have five less HP.
[35:49.31]Let's bring back Terminator Fieri.
[35:51.87]Hold on.
[35:54.62]I got shot and did five damage.
[35:56.06]Why does he only have a gun this time?
[35:59.97]Though I cannot play my ace trump hearts over your king.
[36:05.82]Apparently not.
[36:07.12]What if... What if I did this?
[36:10.88]Nope.
[36:12.94]Do you have any bonuses?
[36:13.90]You could mess me up with a bonus right now if you really wanted to.
[36:17.08]The bonus literally goes off the screen.
[36:19.52]Oh.
[36:19.76]Like, the bonus text is...
[36:23.53]That kills anybody.
[36:24.33]Like, you've been shot.
[36:25.67]I've been shot.
[36:26.13]You've been stabbed.
[36:27.93]Your turn.
[36:28.55]I think I'm going to win this one.
[36:29.60]We're in face armor.
[36:32.90]It's early access.
[36:36.12]T?
[36:36.50]Oh, come on.
[36:37.08]You're going to play a T right now?
[36:38.50]I am going to play a T. That's going to do, like, a ton of damage.
[36:42.11]I have nothing I can do about that.
[36:43.23]But I can do this.
[36:43.81]Get out of here.
[36:51.43]What is that, like hit the hitchhiking card?
[36:53.07]That's like the get out of here card.
[36:57.05]Hold on, what did I just get?
[36:58.66]Oh, speaking of get out, I thought that was a T. I was about to play this and be really mad.
[37:03.22]I thought that was a T. That's just the Great British Pound.
[37:08.52]Let's go with... I don't think you're going to be able to excuse me this one.
[37:22.98]Is that a mouse trap over here?
[37:26.46]T. I love someone who just wrote in the chat, this game is weird.
[37:32.08]Oh, it's mine.
[37:37.28]Sorry.
[37:37.54]Oh, you're not paying attention?
[37:41.78]What are you doing?
[37:44.86]I don't think I have anything.
[37:45.96]Get him again.
[37:47.42]He's at 35%.
[37:48.90]He's done for.
[37:55.10]Alright.
[37:55.88]Alright.
[37:56.86]This game sucks.
[37:59.69]Don't say that yet.
[38:00.53]We've only seen the entire game what the whole game has to offer.
[38:04.13]We have to, like, give it another few minutes.
[38:08.87]Terminator King.
[38:10.87]This game is weird.
[38:12.12]I don't think I can do anything about that, so I'm going to go ahead and say thank you for playing that card.
[38:17.36]I'll take the damage.
[38:22.08]What's the finisher?
[38:23.06]So I get shot, you get shot.
[38:25.20]I get stabbed, you get stabbed.
[38:26.88]Can you be a little more original, please, next time?
[38:29.42]Thanks.
[38:29.94]Somebody just gave $100 for this.
[38:33.78]For this game.
[38:34.86]And this moment.
[38:36.19]Yeah, if this game's like $6, you could buy like 20 copies of this game.
[38:39.41]I could buy like 25 copies of this game.
[38:42.29]It's actually 20.
[38:42.99]I did the math.
[38:43.85]Oh, you just did the math.
[38:44.67]Nice.
[38:45.51]Quick.
[38:46.15]Quick.
[38:47.19]How about Crying Wednesday Addams?
[38:51.63]Not Wednesday Adams.
[38:53.13]The Wendy's girl.
[38:53.77]Why did I say Wednesday?
[38:57.39]The Wendy's girl, not Wednesday Adams.
[39:02.38]I'm going to check that in just a minute.
[39:04.72]Oh my god, it was more than that.
[39:06.02]What the fuck?
[39:09.30]Oh my god, somebody gave a lot of money.
[39:12.19]I just played a bonus, and I'm not sure.
[39:15.17]Quick math.
[39:16.35]What did you get for the bonus?
[39:17.51]I...
[39:19.72]Why'd you lose?
[39:21.27]Why are you getting stabbed?
[39:23.95]I'm still holding the card.
[39:26.35]Why are you still... Alright, I'm gonna finish you off, because somebody just gave, like, a monumental amount of money, and I can't even look at it.
[39:33.09]What is that?
[39:33.83]A 10?
[39:34.49]That's a 10 times 3.
[39:36.55]10 times 3 of... That's 30, so do you have a 30 in your hand?
[39:40.98]No, but why can I not do this?
[39:42.32]I can't trump card that out?
[39:44.60]I don't understand how this game is supposed to work.
[39:48.66]Um...
[39:50.88]I can't do anything about this.
[39:52.40]I want to see if this does 10 times 3 damage to you.
[39:54.68]Let's see if he's gonna... 1, 2, 3.
[39:57.10]How much damage did it do?
[39:58.90]Only did 10.
[40:00.20]Okay, well, I'm gonna finish you off right here.
[40:03.42]Okay.
[40:03.84]How do I want to finish you?
[40:04.66]Let's see.
[40:05.72]Make it interesting.
[40:06.42]Alright, I'm gonna make it really interesting.
[40:07.70]Let's see, we got... I think I want to, like, tear you apart.
[40:11.42]Yeah.
[40:11.96]I'm gonna put, like, thorns all over you.
[40:14.92]You're in so much trouble.
[40:21.64]Oh no, my internet's dying again.
[40:25.62]No internet, no internet, come on!
[40:27.76]Uh oh, look what I did!
[40:29.98]I wanna see what the person said!
[40:33.61]Don't end the stream!
[40:34.63]You have to play a card!
[40:37.99]I can't do anything, just trump me!
[40:41.81]I think I dodged.
[40:46.15]You're in big trouble!
[40:48.99]Oh god, am I gonna lose?
[40:51.24]This card literally says Hitler on it.
[40:53.64]Oh, that's great.
[40:56.58]I can't read the rest of it, but I'm pretty sure that it says Hitler.
[40:59.71]I'm gonna die.
[41:04.17]I'm at 20 HP.
[41:04.75]Is my internet holding up?
[41:08.87]This is where I gotta... I gotta beat you right here.
[41:12.75]We've got... There we go.
[41:16.19]No, it's your turn.
[41:16.85]Did you pass?
[41:19.38]Com class.
[41:20.26]Com class quality of insurance.
[41:23.08]Oh, come on.
[41:23.87]I'm gonna lose.
[41:24.79]You just won.
[41:25.19]You're gonna lose.
[41:25.99]No, no, no.
[41:26.53]Wait, wait, wait.
[41:27.97]Oh, my fucking god.
[41:28.99]I lose.
[41:29.83]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[41:31.95]I can't do that either.
[41:33.31]No, you won.
[41:33.87]I lose again.
[41:36.37]Yeah, just kill me.
[41:37.39]It's over.
[41:38.37]What are you gonna do to me?
[41:41.69]Hit you with a bat approximately five, six, seven, seven times.
[41:46.31]Get the fuck out of here.
[41:47.63]My internet's dying.
[41:50.75]That was fun.
[41:52.15]Yeah.
[41:52.75]I bet we could play this game for like an hour, hour and a half.
[41:55.09]Well, it's been 40 minutes.
[41:57.07]Stuff would have lost castle.
[41:57.93]That's what I was told earlier today.
[42:00.50]Hour and a half.
[42:01.18]Alright.
[42:01.84]Hold on.
[42:02.08]I got some.
[42:03.80]Get lost castle ready to go and meet back here in five minutes.
[42:07.54]Alright.
[42:09.88]Anyways, we're gonna move to Lost Castle.
[42:12.74]This is like a side-scrolling rogue-like RPG kind of beat-em-up that seems like it could be fun with more than one person.
[42:20.30]That was Lynch.
[42:22.70]Okay.
[42:25.14]That was a game.
[42:26.07]Let me just set this up.
[42:35.87]What am I gonna even change the title to?
[42:37.69]How about
[42:40.54]castle smashers castle smashers that's awful but I don't even whatever um but anyways amco the terrible amco the terrible gave 250 dollars
[43:01.29]That is insane.
[43:04.72]250 bucks in the message.
[43:06.28]So hopefully the stream is not like dot.
[43:08.60]Thank God I muted that because that was a shock into my ear.
[43:12.40]I'm so glad I muted that before that came up.
[43:14.97]Oh my Lord.
[43:15.53]Hold on.
[43:15.99]Just hold on.
[43:23.51]Every single video game.
[43:24.75]Alright.
[43:24.95]Turn the vibe.
[43:25.38]I got to plug my, um, that's fine.
[43:28.00]Okay.
[43:30.05]Anyways, thank you so much, dude.
[43:31.81]Amco, thank you.
[43:32.55]You say, hey Jerma, just wanted to say thanks for everything you do.
[43:37.25]The steady stream of content helps occupy my time.
[43:40.34]It helps.
[43:40.74]It really helps.
[43:42.12]I'm a depressed disabled veteran struggling to really find my place in life and find any kind of inner peace.
[43:49.76]And so it's nice to be able to catch your streams and watch your past broadcasts.
[43:52.90]Thanks.
[43:53.50]Also, the game sucks.
[43:56.89]Thank you so much, dude.
[44:01.79]I feel horrible to hear that you're a disabled veteran.
[44:06.17]But first of all, thank you so much for serving the country.
[44:10.68]That's an incredible service.
[44:14.80]And second of all, I'm so, so humbled that somebody would ever say something like that about me.
[44:29.07]And my streams and my content.
[44:32.19]I wish you the best, man.
[44:43.00]That's a lot of money to give me, though.
[44:45.12]Thank you.
[44:49.21]But let's... Let me try to get this to open.
[44:53.83]Hopefully my stream is like...
[44:58.36]What if they serve a different country?
[45:00.58]Whatever country you have given your service to.
[45:03.58]Thank you.
[45:08.38]And my stream is like severely struggling right now.
[45:12.40]I've dropped 20,000 frames.
[45:18.59]I don't know what's going on with my internet, but it does not want to work tonight for some reason.
[45:23.63]Let me just plug my controller and hopefully this passes.
[45:25.55]Otherwise, we're going to have to make it a real early stream because it's just not going to work.
[45:30.43]It's going to turn off.
[45:32.42]And I'm really sorry about that because obviously me and Etalyx are going to play some games tonight.
[45:36.98]That's unfortunate.
[45:39.94]Let me just get my controller plugged in.
[45:42.72]Give me a second.
[45:46.89]Is this correct?
[45:51.01]Yeah, it is.
[46:00.29]Where are you?
[46:01.59]Come on.
[46:02.89]I need you.
[46:03.51]I need you right now.
[46:06.93]There.
[46:11.90]Fuck.
[46:12.22]Come on.
[46:12.48]I'm like, I'm trying to waste so much time so this can pass.
[46:16.68]God damn it.
[46:23.53]Net neutrality.
[46:25.61]Yeah.
[46:26.07]Oh, hey.
[46:27.53]Open up my internet.
[46:30.11]Quit throttling me off.
[46:33.88]Let's move this to... This is not... I'm going to have to tell Tal because this might be a... This might be a detonate the stream stream.
[46:49.74]Because I am at like 600k.
[46:54.75]Alright, so if you want to watch, like, a stream, like, go to Etalyx' stream because, like, this one is at 500k.
[47:01.63]Jesus.
[47:03.71]It's going to change the game capture.
[47:08.30]Maybe it'll pass.
[47:08.96]I'm hoping it'll pass here in a minute.
[47:14.34]Stream times two, and it goes away within, like, 15, 20 minutes.
[47:17.54]Well, let's get started then.
[47:18.96]Which is still a long time.
[47:22.50]Alright, so I need to turn on my gamepad control.
[47:29.84]Well, this is not correct.
[47:32.30]Oh, I'm at zero.
[47:38.61]We have actually detonated at zero.
[47:40.41]I think the stream is off.
[47:42.77]No, we're back.
[47:49.04]Oh my God.
[47:51.38]I hope my stream wasn't turned on for that.
[47:56.71]Do you have a controller plugged in?
[47:59.67]No.
[48:01.79]Should I?
[48:02.15]I would assume.
[48:04.85]Oh my God.
[48:05.24]I got to like clean this off.
[48:09.18]Damn it, man.
[48:10.58]What?
[48:11.40]Do I need to mute?
[48:12.34]No, no, no.
[48:13.30]My stream is... What are you doing?
[48:15.02]I can't... I'm going to... Alright.
[48:17.42]Just look at the display.
[48:19.70]Okay.
[48:20.08]This is so stupid.
[48:22.69]Internet.
[48:23.07]Like, I turned my goddamn stream on, and, like, my internet's just like, you know what?
[48:26.79]Today is the day.
[48:27.55]I don't even care anymore.
[48:32.05]Big wow.
[48:33.93]Alright.
[48:35.41]Multiplayer.
[48:38.55]Uh, online multiplayer.
[48:41.39]How do I, like, join your video game?
[48:43.24]Connecting to server.
[48:46.34]Like, seriously, when you came back and were like, oh, I hope my stream wasn't live for that.
[48:50.37]I was like, uh...
[48:53.00]Are you nude right now?
[48:56.04]Did you have a wardrobe malfunction?
[48:58.42]The camera came back on and I'm just naked in a bathrobe.
[49:01.72]Oh, I do have a bathrobe.
[49:02.80]I hope my stream wasn't live for that just now.
[49:04.96]I have a bathrobe story for you.
[49:07.08]Can you make the game?
[49:08.18]Because my internet can't handle hosting.
[49:10.08]I'm actually in the game.
[49:11.36]What is it called?
[49:11.76]I can invite friends.
[49:12.90]Is it called?
[49:13.22]It's called, you can guess, but it's called playing a real game.
[49:17.26]I don't see that.
[49:18.47]That's the name of the room name.
[49:19.97]You might have to actually be on friends list to join.
[49:23.95]Alright, let me see.
[49:25.77]Because I made it private.
[49:27.53]Oh, that's probably why.
[49:31.46]Can you go ahead and do me a favor and invite me to that game?
[49:35.52]Did you get the invite?
[49:42.72]I did just get the invite.
[49:43.96]Let's see if we can rock and roll.
[49:48.69]Am I in?
[49:52.15]Hey, there we are.
[49:53.11]Hey.
[49:54.72]I have a controller plugged in, and it's not doing anything.
[49:56.84]Yeah, me either, so we have to play mouse and keyboard.
[49:59.31]Alright, change appearance.
[50:00.29]Let's change our appearance.
[50:04.37]Alright, this one, I guess.
[50:07.05]No, you can't be green as well.
[50:08.75]I know, that's why I'm changing.
[50:10.17]Steam noise.
[50:14.48]I like this one.
[50:17.26]Alright, that's fine.
[50:17.98]Are we ready?
[50:18.76]I guess we're ready.
[50:21.08]You look pretty kawaii.
[50:23.93]Don't ever say that again.
[50:26.54]New save file.
[50:27.62]I want to play.
[50:29.44]Don't delete my saves.
[50:30.48]Hey, you have control of this.
[50:32.02]Why are you controlling mine?
[50:33.78]Which one of us is player one and which is player two?
[50:36.48]I was the one that invited you.
[50:38.22]Oh.
[50:39.54]So how are you controlling the game?
[50:40.86]I don't know, but this is going to be fun.
[50:45.44]My stream is dead.
[50:46.66]My stream can't even function.
[50:50.26]Why?
[50:52.95]We're gonna go to zero, guys.
[50:54.07]It's just a matter of time.
[50:55.87]Is that him that just did that?
[50:58.17]Oh my god, that's so funny!
[51:05.69]I'm so angry right now.
[51:07.21]Isn't this just the Castle Crashers intro?
[51:10.21]It kind of is.
[51:10.81]I don't even... I'm so mad that I can't even... I'm screaming at like two frames a second.
[51:20.51]I think that's the last boss.
[51:25.55]I bet the wizard is in on it the whole time.
[51:28.29]No, he's not.
[51:29.39]This game actually is supposed to be very fun and, uh... Alright, well... You opened up a portal to hell.
[51:41.58]58 frames a minute.
[51:42.36]58 frames a minute?
[51:44.34]98, 89 frames a minute.
[51:48.13]Only power with EVGA's newest GTX 1080 Ti.
[51:53.35]58 frames per minute.
[51:55.87]Yeah, by the way, the stream, I'm telling you right now, guys, the stream is going to collapse.
[52:01.75]So when it does, thank you so much for watching.
[52:06.09]See you next time, but we're going to ride it out as long as we can.
[52:11.43]Happy New Year from Comcast.
[52:13.39]We disabled your internet.
[52:15.35]It must be like a...
[52:17.50]Regional thing, because I have Comcast as well.
[52:21.83]Yeah.
[52:22.23]I've only dropped 250 frames.
[52:23.11]Alright, so E is pick up.
[52:25.63]How come you have a gun?
[52:27.39]I do have a gun.
[52:28.21]What are we picking up?
[52:29.99]You have a bow and arrow.
[52:31.81]Okay, you can sprint.
[52:33.57]Can I pick you up?
[52:34.77]Treasure hunter.
[52:35.37]I don't think so.
[52:37.31]Spaces jump, obviously.
[52:38.53]Okay.
[52:43.74]Let's go.
[52:47.42]There's a lot of buttons.
[52:48.90]Why is K attacked?
[52:50.98]Wait a minute.
[52:51.66]Why would K be attacked?
[52:55.22]L is... Dude, I have to put both my hands on the keyboard.
[52:58.58]Why can't I just use a controller?
[53:00.01]No mouses.
[53:01.75]We're playing a PC game from like 1998.
[53:07.59]It's all on the keyboard.
[53:09.03]Oh, Jesus.
[53:09.83]You... I'm playing...
[53:15.90]I'm getting a controller.
[53:17.16]Do you have an Xbox controller?
[53:18.42]Yeah, I already plugged it in.
[53:20.28]It doesn't work.
[53:20.82]Your Xbox controller don't work?
[53:22.60]Hang on.
[53:22.92]I'm going to try again.
[53:23.76]Do you have an Xbox One controller?
[53:26.71]Yeah, it's Xbox One.
[53:28.33]It's plugged in right now.
[53:29.59]And it's not working.
[53:30.71]Hold on.
[53:31.01]I'm going to escape.
[53:32.93]How do you go to menu?
[53:33.85]Uh-oh.
[53:36.29]Uh-oh.
[53:36.95]Uh-oh.
[53:38.09]What are you talking about?
[53:39.61]Exit all video games.
[53:41.15]What have you done?
[53:42.23]There, I'm back.
[53:44.30]I like changed all my scenes.
[53:46.89]There.
[53:47.49]Gamepad controls.
[53:50.47]Hold on.
[53:52.27]That's super attack.
[53:53.11]How many?
[53:53.69]Actually, I think it's working now.
[53:54.83]It is?
[53:55.35]How'd you do it?
[53:56.97]I literally like changed every scene on OBS.
[53:59.37]Okay, you changed every scene on OBS.
[54:01.41]I hit like escape, up, down, left, right, and then I tabbed back out and back in and it worked out.
[54:07.22]What do you mean?
[54:09.74]What are you talking about?
[54:11.44]How did you do this?
[54:13.30]I just told you how I did it.
[54:14.70]I'll tab in.
[54:16.32]Press the button.
[54:16.80]Unplug it.
[54:17.86]Plug it in.
[54:18.80]Yeah, I unplugged it, plugged it back in, tabbed, switched all the scenes, and now it works.
[54:23.29]Now it works.
[54:24.43]Mine doesn't work.
[54:28.87]You have an Xbox controller?
[54:29.71]I don't know.
[54:31.61]What?
[54:32.67]Entertain them for a minute.
[54:33.59]I'm going to get my Xbox controller.
[54:35.57]What are you trying to play with?
[54:36.61]PS4?
[54:39.86]Careful.
[54:41.10]This is not an IRL stream.
[54:42.30]You gotta save those jokes for when the camera's turned on.
[54:45.80]Where's my Xbox controller?
[54:47.67]You can't do those just microphone jokes.
[54:49.33]You gotta have the webcam turned on for that one.
[54:51.33]Wait a minute.
[54:53.85]What's in here?
[54:58.79]Desperate times call for desperate measures.
[55:03.09]We're plugging in a Steam controller.
[55:05.86]Are you ready for this?
[55:07.08]Why don't you play with Steam Link, too?
[55:12.68]I'm plugging in the Steam controller right now.
[55:14.46]Uh-oh.
[55:15.34]Did it work?
[55:21.47]Ladies and gentlemen, that's... Why nobody plays PlayStation anymore?
[55:25.89]My computer crashed.
[55:29.35]Did it really?
[55:37.48]Well, you know...
[55:40.48]Wait, wait, wait.
[55:41.10]Hold on.
[55:41.56]I'm going to try to get it back.
[55:42.36]Good thing this is a co-op stream.
[55:47.90]Oh, this is a disaster.
[55:49.84]How are you still talking to me if your computer crashed, though?
[55:53.16]The game is locked.
[55:54.58]No, it's not.
[55:54.96]Hold on.
[55:59.84]Oh, you fucking stupid thing.
[56:01.44]I hate computers.
[56:03.10]What do we even need computers for, seriously?
[56:06.90]No, there we go.
[56:07.30]Hold on.
[56:07.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[56:08.10]I had to...
[56:09.07]I want everybody to know that Jerma picked all the games today.
[56:13.03]I have no hand in this.
[56:13.87]I'm good.
[56:14.11]I'm good.
[56:14.33]I'm good.
[56:15.55]Alright.
[56:15.95]So how the hell does this work?
[56:20.27]B picks up items.
[56:21.43]Okay.
[56:22.33]B for me is jump.
[56:26.73]Good luck.
[56:30.07]Oh, God.
[56:30.81]These are all wrong.
[56:34.27]I can walk around, but I can't attack.
[56:36.03]Yeah, try using the triggers.
[56:38.79]No, the trigger, like, exited the game last time.
[56:41.26]Hold on.
[56:43.50]My attack, like, sucks, by the way.
[56:46.80]This character, like, sucks.
[56:48.20]I think I can do it individually.
[56:50.24]I can.
[56:51.50]Okay, so let's go attack.
[56:54.50]Special action.
[56:56.40]Jump.
[56:58.58]Pick up interact.
[57:00.18]Is this doing anything?
[57:01.55]No, you're just standing still on my screen.
[57:03.45]No, no, I'm talking about just in general.
[57:05.00]Discard item.
[57:08.16]Use item.
[57:11.34]Use skill.
[57:12.54]Did that fucking do anything?
[57:18.60]You're still just standing there.
[57:23.09]Unless you're talking to yourself.
[57:24.49]There you go.
[57:24.95]Now you're moving.
[57:26.13]Now you're jumping.
[57:26.97]And you can't attack.
[57:30.06]Don't you have an Xbox One controller?
[57:32.36]Yeah, but it's like dead.
[57:33.67]Okay, I can pick up items.
[57:35.13]I just can't attach.
[57:35.93]Plug it in.
[57:36.97]I don't even know where it is.
[57:40.19]My fucking stream is like at zero K up.
[57:43.65]How come every time we stream together, it's like it is the technical support.
[57:47.63]Because God hates me.
[57:50.38]That's why.
[57:51.66]Every single time.
[57:56.73]my stream works I've only dropped a hundred more frames since we've been talking what is your special attack uh it's this I can't even do anything I can use the keyboard it's pow right in the kisser hold on I'm gonna give one more thing here oh yeah what a joke I'm going back to menu because I am not I'm not playing this game with this character
[58:27.87]I'm like listening into the echo chamber.
[58:34.32]Alright.
[58:37.38]I'm just going to play with the keyboard because it's going to take me like 15 minutes to go find this controller.
[58:41.46]I am actually really fucking mad right now.
[58:44.17]I'm undeniably upset.
[58:47.17]Where are you?
[58:47.65]Let's go.
[58:48.95]Let's go play this fucking game.
[58:51.44]I backed out.
[58:52.46]What do you mean you backed out?
[58:54.35]I want to pick a new character because my character sucks.
[58:56.11]What do you mean your character sucks?
[58:58.29]He's just a shotgun that goes pow.
[58:59.89]It literally just says pow whenever I do the attack button.
[59:02.53]Why can't I leave the game?
[59:06.07]I can't leave the game.
[59:07.85]Oh, wow.
[59:09.95]Just match made on accident.
[59:12.66]There actually was a server called Next a minute ago, which is pretty dedicated.
[59:18.28]I'm not going to lie.
[59:21.32]That is a dedicated jokester.
[59:27.60]I can't.
[59:29.05]By the way, I actually cannot exit the game.
[59:31.93]I can't even open up my task manager.
[59:34.03]I'm sorry.
[59:35.27]This is not even fucking funny.
[59:37.27]I am so upset right now.
[59:40.42]Oh, God.
[59:40.92]I'm going to rage off stream tonight.
[59:48.04]Where even is it?
[59:49.54]I might as well just, like, turn on the fucking webcam and be in a bathrobe.
[59:52.00]That's, like, what I'm in right now.
[59:53.02]And I had a bathrobe story for you.
[59:58.44]Hey, we're doing great at 4K up on my stream.
[60:01.04]That's fan-fucking-tastic.
[60:04.24]4K up?
[60:04.47]That's enough for 480p?
[60:05.53]I mean, like, 4 kilobytes up.
[60:08.13]Oh.
[60:10.17]That's enough for 56K?
[60:10.73]No?
[60:10.79]4K?
[60:10.87]4K.
[60:10.91]High definition.
[60:16.99]Why is this not even listed here?
[60:18.13]Oh, my God.
[60:21.31]Alright, which one of these is the prettiest characters?
[60:24.99]Chat.
[60:26.01]Oh, I think I passed it.
[60:27.21]Maybe this one.
[60:30.61]Why can't shit just work, man?
[60:31.96]Like, why can't it just fucking work?
[60:33.36]Let me try this again.
[60:36.06]One last time, and then I'm going to play with the keyboard, and then I'm going to, like, cry myself to sleep because I think the stream is actually down.
[60:45.47]Alright, can we pass?
[60:46.95]100,000 frames dropped, I wonder.
[60:50.49]I don't think chat can even count that high.
[60:52.75]Oh no, don't start that.
[60:53.79]Don't do that.
[60:55.03]Come on.
[60:55.63]I'm like, I'm struggling here.
[60:57.54]And you're trying to get people to do fucking counting memes?
[61:01.26]I'm struggling.
[61:04.98]It just has to, any time.
[61:06.86]This is the second time you brought it up.
[61:12.13]You've brought up the counting shit.
[61:14.55]Oh my lord.
[61:15.27]Alright, here we go.
[61:17.83]Say your prayers.
[61:18.71]Here they go.
[61:24.85]We can try.
[61:27.29]I just got shot in the head by a gun.
[61:29.75]Oh my head.
[61:31.37]Nah, this is it.
[61:35.43]I gotta use the keyboard.
[61:37.83]Sometimes you deal with it.
[61:38.81]One of those times to deal with it.
[61:50.20]There we go.
[61:50.76]Definitely this one.
[61:58.01]Ruins his own chat.
[62:03.05]Masochist.
[62:03.97]Invite me to the game.
[62:04.85]I'm going to play MLB MVP 2K4 on the PC with both my hands on the keyboard.
[62:11.96]I almost invited stealth.
[62:13.42]That would be pretty funny.
[62:16.19]Where are you?
[62:17.09]You're not even appearing where I can see you.
[62:20.16]How am I not online?
[62:23.04]There we go.
[62:24.08]Oh, look.
[62:24.44]Somebody's inviting me to a video game.
[62:25.90]Can't wait to play it.
[62:27.40]Can't wait to play it.
[62:28.08]Keyboard and mouse.
[62:28.80]All you gotta do is I-J-K-L.
[62:31.93]Unbelievable.
[62:32.63]I'm so sorry, everybody.
[62:33.65]This game looks like it could be fun, too.
[62:38.55]My PS4 controller works for every single video game except for this one.
[62:45.37]I'm going to go with the guy with the beard.
[62:48.27]Tell Jerma all his old viewers are in your chat now.
[62:53.52]They can actually watch the stream.
[62:54.92]All his old viewers.
[62:56.64]They're not yours anymore.
[62:58.14]I'm ready.
[62:59.40]You've got to pick somebody way cuter than that.
[63:02.22]That guy is just kind of crusty.
[63:04.50]Look, we don't got time.
[63:06.02]We don't got time for this.
[63:06.74]He's got a scar on his cheek.
[63:07.92]He's battle-hardened.
[63:09.15]You've got to have somebody that has a little bit of a sunny disposition in the squad.
[63:12.33]A little bit of hope, ray of sunshine.
[63:13.35]Fine, this guy.
[63:14.81]Oh, yeah, he's definitely, like, main character potential.
[63:17.23]Yeah, he's main character potential.
[63:21.11]Yeah, just overwrite all the saves.
[63:23.02]I forgot that we have to watch the intro.
[63:24.84]No, just skip it.
[63:25.98]You can skip it, right?
[63:27.22]How?
[63:27.38]I don't know.
[63:28.08]Press enter.
[63:28.62]Press escape.
[63:29.58]Press start.
[63:32.48]I had to pick a different character.
[63:33.72]The other one was miserable.
[63:34.94]Oh.
[63:41.13]Well, to like the 400 people that left the stream, I'm sorry that it was this bad.
[63:47.95]You know the over-under, like 10% of every stream I do has to be like a technical disaster.
[63:52.44]That's like how it works.
[63:55.50]If I stream 100 times, 10 of them are gonna be like Steam Controller crashes your desktop.
[63:59.99]Like, this is how it works.
[64:01.99]Watch out for the stag beetle.
[64:06.00]Was that like old kids TV show with like the Beatles but they were Power Rangers, but they were like in beetle costumes.
[64:12.92]Yeah What's the name of that show This is still better than the Family Guy stream do I have like anything download in the background or something like what is going on here I
[64:27.66]No, the family got streamed way better than this.
[64:28.92]Beetleborgs!
[64:30.04]No, I was just reading a comment.
[64:31.26]I didn't agree with it.
[64:32.06]I just thought it was funny.
[64:33.38]Big Bad Beetleborgs!
[64:35.48]I love that show.
[64:36.06]Big Bad Beetleborgs?
[64:37.32]Yeah, they were Beetleborgs.
[64:39.30]The show was great.
[64:41.66]Oh, God.
[64:44.38]Alright, tell me the story.
[64:46.29]Oh, okay.
[64:46.77]Alright, anyways.
[64:48.19]So, I woke up this morning and I had a bathrobe on.
[64:51.89]Uh-huh.
[64:52.19]And, you know...
[64:54.00]No, I'm just not feeling it.
[64:55.28]I'm going to have to get a little bit happier before I tell the story.
[65:01.04]I would love to tell you that story.
[65:01.84]I have to get happier.
[65:02.98]I have to get a little happier.
[65:03.76]Alright, this is way better.
[65:06.19]I have a bow again.
[65:08.71]So let's just go.
[65:10.27]I mean, let's be real, though.
[65:11.73]If you were going to stereotype that character, that's the bow character.
[65:15.45]I mean, it kind of is.
[65:16.39]So let's do keyboard, mouse.
[65:18.51]No, not keyboard.
[65:19.09]Okay.
[65:20.76]K is attack.
[65:22.05]J is special.
[65:22.81]And L is use skill.
[65:25.39]So I have that.
[65:26.02]That's like a skill.
[65:26.76]So your skill is on a charge.
[65:32.97]I don't think they like that I'm playing this game.
[65:34.65]Alright, Apple.
[65:35.65]It gives you 10 HP.
[65:36.87]You can pick up coins.
[65:40.86]E is just... I guess you just pick it up.
[65:43.48]Okay, U is select item.
[65:46.06]O is select item.
[65:47.20]I is use item.
[65:48.44]Oh my lord.
[65:49.04]I'm like learning how to type again.
[65:51.64]Alright, there's our first chest.
[65:54.96]Wow, look at that.
[65:55.54]A huge golden chest which only will appear after heroic achievements.
[66:03.07]Hey, leave some for me.
[66:04.25]Oh, wait, I forgot it's like Diablo II.
[66:05.47]Alright, show status, previous page, next page.
[66:10.48]Okay, dagger.
[66:11.90]Oh, like the RB... Yeah, I get it, I get it.
[66:15.74]It's like an item.
[66:17.38]Oops, now it's gone.
[66:18.45]That looks good so far, okay.
[66:23.41]R is discard.
[66:25.25]My hand, I'm gonna get arthritis from playing this.
[66:28.95]You gotta have the claw grip to play with the keyboard.
[66:33.08]Into the game already.
[66:33.89]We're supposed to dodge that.
[66:35.11]Have we passed the threshold where my stream works?
[66:38.27]I don't know.
[66:38.73]I think so.
[66:45.37]Wait, it's loading a cutscene.
[66:47.37]Why are we separated?
[66:50.40]We gotta meet up again.
[66:51.88]Do we actually have to meet up again?
[66:56.62]I can hear you.
[66:58.08]Come out of your cells.
[67:00.97]Where are you?
[67:01.45]Are you attacking me?
[67:03.25]Oh no, you're already out of health.
[67:04.97]You know, you are so loud.
[67:08.05]That is just like too much.
[67:09.54]It's too much.
[67:14.34]Press auto combo.
[67:18.00]Okay.
[67:23.61]I am the blacksmith.
[67:24.51]Damn it.
[67:25.75]I'm holding out hope that I can still use this fucking thing.
[67:28.64]Alright.
[67:31.10]Stream's good.
[67:31.96]Good.
[67:32.74]It actually is watchable.
[67:33.64]Alright, let's talk to this sack boy.
[67:37.36]Alright, talk.
[67:38.64]How do you talk?
[67:41.69]Are you talking to this guy?
[67:43.23]Yeah, he just said, are you sure you want to open the cage?
[67:45.61]It's dangerous.
[67:46.49]And I was like, yeah, I want to play this video game.
[67:50.23]Watch out.
[67:50.65]Dodge the arrows.
[67:52.53]Easier said than done.
[67:55.65]Yeah, it's easier said than done.
[67:57.47]I'm playing the piano right now.
[68:00.83]Listen, Dodge, I'm already like halfway dead.
[68:03.01]Are you dead?
[68:03.91]I'm getting my ass hurt.
[68:08.51]Wow, look at that multi-shot arrow.
[68:10.19]Wow.
[68:13.71]Why is that happening?
[68:17.51]Hold on.
[68:17.83]How do you use it?
[68:18.62]There you go.
[68:19.20]I just threw a banana.
[68:20.24]What am I accidentally doing?
[68:25.97]Do I have auto... Listen, let me just handle this, and then you just keep, like, tagging along in the back.
[68:38.34]Get hit by falling chests.
[68:41.70]I'll just continue to be totally useless.
[68:45.56]Fine, I'll take your thing.
[68:49.04]Alright, I am now the, like, barbarian.
[68:52.47]This actually looks like it could be pretty fun.
[68:55.43]If I didn't have to play Beethoven's fucking Sonata.
[69:03.11]I'm gonna get hit by everything.
[69:05.09]Is this like Link's Journey to the Past where you can get stuff out of containers?
[69:08.81]I'm gonna die, so... There's a lot of enemies in here, to be fair.
[69:16.63]I'm dead.
[69:19.34]I have 18 health.
[69:23.73]So when you described it as Binding of Isaac, I wasn't really sure what you meant.
[69:27.99]But apparently what you meant is you die in the tutorial.
[69:32.17]I think so.
[69:36.79]That's what you meant.
[69:37.39]I don't want to play the piano.
[69:38.95]The whole game's over.
[69:39.98]I don't want to play the piano.
[69:44.34]So we actually get scored, and there's not like a respawn at checkpoint.
[69:49.81]You just go back into the cell.
[69:51.67]We were supposed to die.
[69:54.85]There were like 30 goblins.
[70:00.40]This is a you're supposed to die sequence.
[70:01.94]Yes, this is a you're supposed to play the you're dead sequence.
[70:05.86]So it's Dark Souls.
[70:07.14]Sure.
[70:09.34]Oh, boy.
[70:13.75]I'm the Lord of Souls in death.
[70:17.37]Alright, hold on.
[70:18.53]Wait, wait, wait.
[70:19.97]Etalyx, just buy some time.
[70:22.17]What?
[70:23.39]Listen, there's actually a countdown timer.
[70:25.23]Look over those and talk about them.
[70:27.17]There is a 40-second countdown timer on sacrifice right now.
[70:33.23]35.
[70:34.87]I got to put points into something.
[70:38.15]I don't know.
[70:38.45]Which cell do you guys want to open?
[70:39.60]The first, the second, or the third?
[70:42.08]Meanwhile, in the aquarium... Meanwhile, in Jerma's aquarium...
[70:47.59]Look, I'm just gonna mute him for a second.
[70:50.57]Pick which one.
[70:52.93]You guys have 15 seconds.
[70:57.42]12 seconds, I'm just gonna put them all in, whichever one.
[71:00.36]There's no fourth.
[71:02.04]Alright, I see third the most.
[71:05.70]What did you do?
[71:07.79]I just unlocked the key to the third cell and it gave us... Are you picking?
[71:15.11]I think you're picking now.
[71:17.65]Yes!
[71:17.83]Alright, I got it.
[71:19.61]We're good.
[71:20.29]I pick now?
[71:21.07]What do I have for points?
[71:22.29]I don't know.
[71:22.61]I put it in the third one.
[71:24.19]You put it in this one, the key to the third cell?
[71:25.73]Yeah.
[71:25.83]Alright, I'm going to put it into the key to the first cell.
[71:29.32]Alright, looks like you have... Open the first cell in the Goblin Tower.
[71:34.80]One of those knives that you spin around your finger.
[71:36.92]I guess.
[71:37.56]In, like, the raid.
[71:38.38]Sacrifice?
[71:39.26]Sacrifice?
[71:41.33]Yeah, you sacrifice the demon soul.
[71:44.75]No relation to Dark Souls, just the demon soul.
[71:47.21]You can only do it.
[71:48.74]You can only do it, and then you have to get rid of all the points.
[71:52.52]Alright, now I'm ready to have fun.
[71:55.14]I actually... Did you hook up a controller?
[71:57.16]I sprinted out of the room and got my controller.
[71:59.79]Let's do it again.
[72:00.49]Alright, this is fun.
[72:01.86]This is fun.
[72:02.50]I like it.
[72:02.96]Here we go.
[72:03.28]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stream.
[72:04.96]Welcome to the fun stream.
[72:07.02]I hope you enjoy yourself at the fun stream.
[72:09.25]I'm a mage now.
[72:10.03]Today, me too.
[72:10.63]You're a mage now.
[72:11.87]I think it's just random.
[72:14.98]You sure?
[72:15.50]Jump.
[72:17.77]This is cool.
[72:19.67]And I think my internet's ready to go.
[72:23.48]Here, come over here.
[72:24.64]Let's do some practice because we don't want to die in the first room.
[72:27.38]That's what this room is for.
[72:28.58]So, right trigger is... Right trigger is your skill move.
[72:36.17]Okay.
[72:37.93]And Y is like a poof.
[72:42.06]Oh, I can get this iron bow.
[72:43.58]No, I don't want the bow.
[72:45.24]Let's be mages.
[72:45.76]Let's try to get this.
[72:46.40]Let's try to actually.
[72:47.14]Nice PowerPoint stream.
[72:49.64]Oh, so this is what happened.
[72:50.56]I unlocked.
[72:51.72]You unlocked the first one.
[72:52.78]I think you unlocked the blacksmith and I unlocked the third cell, which is this person.
[72:58.27]Thank you for releasing me.
[73:00.21]I think they give us potions.
[73:01.21]Yeah, she just gave us a free potion.
[73:05.92]This is probably a good weapon.
[73:08.76]Not even Comcast.
[73:09.96]I'm running on the same node.
[73:14.06]They probably haven't updated the Comcast neighborhood node in like 19 years.
[73:21.36]Before even broadband existed.
[73:28.35]Nothing I can do about it.
[73:28.97]I'm sorry, guys.
[73:31.37]I'm trying to ride it out.
[73:32.39]Stream's still on.
[73:34.76]God.
[73:38.90]And then it's not ready.
[73:42.22]They take a dot.
[73:43.24]They take a dot.
[73:43.96]That's cool.
[73:44.26]They take a dot?
[73:44.96]They take a dot.
[73:45.62]Concentrating.
[73:46.14]Oh, so maybe you have to just dodge go through them?
[73:48.96]They might.
[73:52.25]How come sometimes your basic attack shoots like three?
[73:54.81]Maybe it's a random chance?
[73:55.85]Yeah, I think it's just a random chance.
[73:58.57]Get something else cool.
[74:00.98]It does take a long time to kill them with the bow.
[74:05.46]With the staff.
[74:06.56]I mean, yeah.
[74:09.53]Is this from Armor Games?
[74:11.11]This guy's like an elite.
[74:12.95]Is that what he is?
[74:13.59]Oh, because he has the Plants vs. Zombies construction worker thing on his head.
[74:17.65]That's how you can tell.
[74:20.34]I steal money.
[74:26.47]Start screaming and don't just show a series of images.
[74:29.81]And they seem to be destroyed yet.
[74:38.04]So I see we don't... There's like a combo you can do too.
[74:42.40]It's not just like if you hit X three times in a row the right way.
[74:45.62]You can do like combos.
[74:47.08]Shit, that hurt.
[74:58.61]Actually, it's not just three times in a row.
[75:07.83]You can kind of just spam it.
[75:09.77]It's all about spam.
[75:14.17]I want the bomb.
[75:15.05]That gun sucks.
[75:15.95]Does it suck?
[75:16.39]Are you sure?
[75:16.85]It's just really boring.
[75:18.73]Is it boring?
[75:19.97]I don't know.
[75:20.75]That's what my main character started with.
[75:23.53]Okay.
[75:23.95]I don't know what just happened.
[75:24.99]Did that hurt you?
[75:25.63]I just hurt myself.
[75:27.22]I did the special move and it hurt me.
[75:28.48]Alright, let's go.
[75:31.92]Are you ready to tell the story yet?
[75:33.87]Oh, okay, so I'm feeling a little bit better.
[75:36.37]I need... Alright, this is intense.
[75:44.35]Yeah, I mean, it's as weird as it probably looks on the screen.
[75:47.63]It's like a high concentration game.
[75:50.45]We're basically playing Cuphead.
[75:52.60]I need to be very, very happy with my current situation before I tell the story.
[75:58.74]Okay, why is that doing that?
[76:01.33]That does like 25 damage, by the way.
[76:05.27]+2 attack.
[76:11.16]I do like how it says that they're actually dead if they're lying on the ground like that.
[76:14.50]Rather than not dead.
[76:15.58]Ooh, what's that thing?
[76:17.06]Source of poison.
[76:18.68]You are poison.
[76:19.56]There's poison running through your veins.
[76:21.75]You resist poison.
[76:22.79]You want that?
[76:24.93]Uh, sure.
[76:26.44]Yeah, you take that.
[76:27.16]I got the +2 attack.
[76:28.16]You take that one.
[76:33.04]Up here?
[76:33.62]Can we go up there?
[76:34.64]No.
[76:35.68]Hey, go pick up the banana peel so you can throw it.
[76:37.46]Ha!
[76:37.78]Gotcha!
[76:38.40]Got him!
[76:39.88]Not right now, man.
[76:41.74]I am not in the mood for this.
[76:44.12]I'm very, like, angerable right now.
[76:46.04]I'm very upset right now.
[76:47.76]I actually don't know where to go.
[76:49.12]I think it's, like, random.
[76:50.00]Maybe we have to go back.
[76:50.72]Yeah, we have to go back, I think.
[76:54.78]Nope, we don't.
[76:56.48]Did we miss something?
[76:58.60]What is happening in my chat right now, actually?
[77:00.52]What is happening in your chat?
[77:01.68]I don't know what's happening.
[77:03.10]Oh, you told people to count, and now they're counting in your stream.
[77:07.12]Hey, it's yours now.
[77:08.84]You can own it now.
[77:09.48]I don't know what's happening.
[77:10.97]I think we have to leave this way.
[77:13.33]It looks like we could go that way.
[77:14.33]I think one of my mods just accidentally banned some people.
[77:18.53]Can we not go up here?
[77:20.47]We weren't supposed to be banned.
[77:21.91]Hey, come stand up here.
[77:24.78]I'm standing next to you.
[77:25.68]I was standing next to you.
[77:26.78]There's nothing up here.
[77:28.18]We have to go this way, then.
[77:32.88]Where are you going?
[77:33.72]Come over here.
[77:36.32]I'm trying to solve problems.
[77:37.82]Alright.
[77:41.94]For today and today only.
[77:43.72]For today and every day afterwards, every single meme is allowed in chat.
[77:49.22]Oh, wow.
[77:49.76]Did you hear that, guys?
[77:53.05]with no bans or restrictions.
[77:54.91]Only those which Nightbot imposes.
[77:57.03]You're allowed to make any joke you want in his stream.
[78:02.55]All of them are allowed.
[78:04.40]Wait, did you say all memes, by the way?
[78:06.44]Yeah, all of them.
[78:07.94]I'm going to die.
[78:09.00]I'm dead here.
[78:09.54]Yeah, me too.
[78:10.44]I have 26 health.
[78:11.06]I have an unknown potion I'm about to use.
[78:15.58]The bomb sucked.
[78:16.64]The guy's throwing the grenades.
[78:17.72]We need to get out of here.
[78:19.84]Is this an anime?
[78:20.62]I just got like, I do not aim with my eye.
[78:23.23]I aim with my heart.
[78:24.61]Unlimited blade works.
[78:25.85]I don't want to use that move anymore.
[78:30.43]I wish that text would stop taking up the entire screen.
[78:36.28]Come on, we got to get everything we can.
[78:45.61]Not doing too bad.
[78:50.08]Okay, I killed a couple.
[78:52.56]God, we do have a lot of points.
[78:55.90]I just walked right into that shit.
[78:57.24]Come on.
[78:57.70]Really?
[78:58.32]I'm gonna get health after this.
[79:01.82]Watch out.
[79:02.10]Watch out for the bomb.
[79:06.26]Okay, it's fine.
[79:07.39]It's fine.
[79:08.73]Oh, but I need health, though.
[79:14.21]We got small magic scabbard fire.
[79:16.51]A magical scabbard drenched with fire.
[79:18.33]Daggers are enchanted with fire.
[79:19.27]You get the attack up.
[79:20.79]There's so many items.
[79:22.37]There's so many.
[79:24.19]You can drop items, though, by the way.
[79:26.07]You take the attack up because I already have two of them.
[79:28.86]I don't know.
[79:29.54]Do I want to be close range or do I want to still be range fire staff guy?
[79:33.74]That's up to you.
[79:36.14]Short sword.
[79:37.04]Attack plus 8%.
[79:38.46]Skill hurl.
[79:39.84]Skill just throw up.
[79:41.70]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[79:42.96]Well, I'm about to take this if you don't.
[79:45.09]What?
[79:45.57]Topaz?
[79:46.05]Go ahead.
[79:47.03]Okay.
[79:47.69]Do you need health?
[79:48.51]Do you need health items?
[79:49.49]I do need health.
[79:50.77]If you could give it to me.
[79:52.12]It's a right thumb stick to drop an item.
[79:54.64]You got it.
[79:55.94]First boss.
[80:01.40]Now that we can actually play this game, I actually think it's fairly fun.
[80:06.85]At least initially here.
[80:07.67]Yes.
[80:09.41]It's mostly fun because we've got to see what the next item we're going to get is.
[80:13.98]And we have to see what you can do in the skill tree.
[80:16.08]That's all I care about is the skill tree.
[80:25.68]There's so many memes right now.
[80:27.94]I am the bone of my jaw, steel is my body, and fire is my blood.
[80:32.53]I have created a thousand blades, unknown to death.
[80:35.21]I died.
[80:36.99]Hey, let's watch Etalyx' stream through my stream, but it's of lower quality.
[80:41.81]That sounds fun.
[80:47.38]So how do I bring you back?
[80:49.00]Where are you?
[80:49.38]I don't think you can.
[80:49.96]Yeah, I think I can.
[80:51.10]Let me try and kill these guys, and then I'll get to you.
[80:56.24]Maybe I... Oh, yeah, I do come back.
[80:57.66]You have to time it.
[80:59.20]You have to play Golf Sword.
[81:04.45]That takes a long time.
[81:07.33]That's a very long time.
[81:08.37]Okay, you... Yeah, there we go.
[81:11.21]That's better.
[81:13.37]Okay.
[81:13.97]Okay.
[81:16.13]Ooh, look at all this.
[81:17.41]Bananas and chicken.
[81:20.13]Jumpstick does like 30 or 40 health.
[81:23.30]Yeah, I needed it.
[81:24.86]I needed it more than you.
[81:27.04]No, I have a much lower health pool than you.
[81:29.79]You have more health than I have max health.
[81:31.83]Well, it don't matter.
[81:33.21]It's okay, though, because I'm not... There you go.
[81:35.83]First boss is Yoshi.
[81:36.77]First boss.
[81:40.67]That's Yoshi's half-frog stepbrother.
[81:43.80]Didn't you say today was the last day for memes anyway?
[81:49.86]Essentially, yeah.
[81:51.28]So, there you go.
[81:52.08]This is the meme funeral.
[81:55.07]Alright, we gotta kill the first one.
[81:55.85]Everybody's giving their last wish.
[82:00.55]Reading the will.
[82:01.29]Let's see what the patterns are.
[82:03.73]Oh!
[82:03.91]Okay, he sprints, then he gets tired.
[82:05.17]He has a lot of health.
[82:06.59]How are you supposed to dodge that?
[82:08.16]Jump over it.
[82:08.66]Why is he just chasing me only?
[82:12.10]Oh, he has a tail whip.
[82:12.84]We're good.
[82:15.78]He's hungry.
[82:16.22]I don't know what that means.
[82:20.12]His eyes are up.
[82:27.01]Just like Dark Souls, man.
[82:27.93]One hit, don't get greedy.
[82:29.47]I'm getting greedy.
[82:31.05]One, two, get out.
[82:33.77]You also have range, don't forget.
[82:36.15]One, two, get out.
[82:38.80]I have to like... Oh my god, I have a million years.
[82:45.00]He's going to do A. Careful.
[82:46.86]I don't know what he's doing.
[82:47.72]He's trying to eat me.
[82:52.53]No.
[82:52.69]Oh, God.
[82:52.91]How do you revive?
[82:53.55]How do you do it?
[82:54.37]You have to, like, stand next to me for, like, 30 seconds.
[82:56.29]So wait until he charges left.
[82:57.07]I just have to stand next to you.
[82:58.67]And press B when you get up to me.
[83:02.41]Nice, like, back hop.
[83:03.44]I just imagine you doing cartwheels.
[83:05.08]Alright.
[83:05.32]When he gets to the middle, hit B. He just, like, belly flopped on me.
[83:10.04]I got to hit him.
[83:13.28]Nice dodging.
[83:18.52]He's got to go all the way over here.
[83:22.18]There's no other faster way to do this?
[83:24.36]Nope.
[83:30.07]All in.
[83:31.21]Got it.
[83:32.85]Instantly.
[83:34.13]Get out of the way.
[83:35.31]You can make it.
[83:36.25]There's an apple over here.
[83:38.29]Hey, apples to apples.
[83:39.22]You know what I'm saying?
[83:44.91]Where'd you get those?
[83:45.85]I don't have any of those.
[83:47.07]It's my special ability.
[83:48.29]It's like my skill.
[83:49.53]I have a special ability that hurts me, so I'm like afraid to use it.
[83:53.08]Having a melee against this guy is like impossible.
[83:55.32]What are you even supposed to do?
[83:56.18]That's a good question.
[83:59.84]Wait till he falls.
[84:02.10]Just dodge, dodge, dodge, and wait till he falls.
[84:06.89]He's gonna come after us again.
[84:08.17]Watch out for it.
[84:08.75]Dodge it.
[84:14.59]You can handle it.
[84:15.79]Give me the green!
[84:16.87]You can handle it.
[84:19.12]I just got all that.
[84:20.58]You did.
[84:20.94]You did pretty much everything.
[84:23.54]Oh my god, I got a lot of those.
[84:24.58]No, you got it too.
[84:28.20]This is not the ideal build for this guy.
[84:30.67]It does not seem ideal.
[84:31.55]Alright, what are we getting here?
[84:35.65]Lots of stuff.
[84:36.59]That's a lot of things.
[84:37.61]Okay, let's separate this.
[84:39.45]Let's be very, very... Alright, you get first pick of the litter.
[84:42.27]What do you want?
[84:42.81]First pick of the litter.
[84:44.27]You mean, like, is there shit and cat pee in here?
[84:45.89]What are you talking about?
[84:46.77]Yeah, like, which cat do you want?
[84:47.85]And the rest of them we're going to have to leave out in the cult.
[84:51.44]I want the Mithril Sword.
[84:53.44]The Mithril?
[84:54.88]Yeah.
[84:56.68]Mithril Sword.
[84:59.66]Okay, a weird spell book may or may not be bound in human skin.
[85:03.24]Unknown potion.
[85:04.41]I'll take that.
[85:05.51]So what does this do?
[85:06.51]I actually have a block.
[85:07.41]That's great.
[85:09.21]Okay, what's my special move?
[85:11.49]It'll be poison dagger boy.
[85:13.15]I can give myself like an overheal essentially, just like a shield.
[85:15.51]Alright, I'm now the poison rogue.
[85:19.86]And I am sword and board overheal guy.
[85:23.84]And I also have a forbidden book made out of skin.
[85:26.90]Alright, stream's going so, stream's alright now.
[85:28.83]We're having fun here.
[85:30.80]It only took us an hour and ten minutes to get there, you know, but sometimes you have to deal with it.
[85:36.21]You know, like, I have to, like, just calm down.
[85:37.83]Hey, you gotta start somewhere.
[85:38.83]Hey, dude, so this morning.
[85:39.41]Wow.
[85:39.49]What happened this morning?
[85:41.31]Funnily enough, so I had a robe on this morning.
[85:43.37]I like to wear a bathrobe.
[85:45.03]I'm, like, a bathrobe kind of guy.
[85:46.41]Like, you know, if I... I'm a nude person, so I like to not put on, like, clothes when I'm just hanging around the house.
[85:52.22]Anyways, so this is a very, very big robe, and it has huge swooping arm holes.
[85:57.90]You know what I'm talking about?
[85:58.66]No!
[85:59.87]It is not like a tiny little robe.
[86:02.71]This is like a World of Warcraft robe.
[86:06.15]There's a lot of stuff happening.
[86:07.77]We'll touch back up.
[86:10.16]There's a lot of stuff happening right now.
[86:20.44]There's so many people.
[86:24.28]There are way too many people on this screen.
[86:25.90]There really are.
[86:28.83]Okay, I've got it.
[86:29.51]It's being handled right now.
[86:33.19]Okay, it doesn't block all damage.
[86:35.39]Oh, man.
[86:36.05]Jesus.
[86:37.23]Woohoo!
[86:44.65]What did I just do?
[86:45.39]I created a little fairy.
[86:48.16]Where am I dead again?
[86:49.16]Oh, you died again.
[86:50.90]Shut up.
[86:52.00]I got you.
[86:54.18]I got you.
[86:56.10]No, I don't.
[86:56.50]Not yet.
[86:57.70]Don't you dare meme me.
[86:59.36]Hey, you're the one that called for this.
[87:01.16]That's not going to happen.
[87:01.84]I got to kill everybody here.
[87:07.01]Sorry.
[87:07.63]Oh boy.
[87:09.51]I have meme power, too, over you.
[87:12.01]You do have... I swear to God, man, I keep seeing this stupid walrus.
[87:16.73]What is it?
[87:18.79]I believe there was a pig, a spider, some ghost oozes.
[87:25.90]+2 crit, sure.
[87:36.03]Anyways, funny story.
[87:38.29]Anyways, really funny story.
[87:40.50]Can't wait to hear how it is.
[87:41.72]My robe has really huge swooping arms that obviously go all the way down.
[87:46.14]It's a long sleeve robe.
[87:48.85]So I was filling up a glass of water.
[87:50.85]I grabbed a glass of water and I was really thirsty and I didn't want to take a shower today.
[87:55.99]So I'm filling up a glass of water from the sink.
[88:00.79]There's another story there.
[88:01.99]I was drinking sink water.
[88:03.07]Two stories in one.
[88:03.81]Wow, what a deal.
[88:04.41]I was drinking sink water.
[88:06.28]There's a story there, but there's another story on a different day.
[88:09.34]Anyways, I'm filling up this big glass of water and I went a little too far.
[88:13.54]And instead of it going into the glass, my, like, wizard robe hand went up, and I was holding the sink up at full blast, and it was going down, like, the arm tube, all the way down, and just, like, soaking me.
[88:26.11]And I, like, I didn't even know for, like, a full, like, three or four seconds.
[88:28.99]So I poured, like, a bucket of water on myself, like, inside of my body.
[88:32.99]And I didn't even know I was doing it.
[88:33.99]I was, like, I was looking at the, I was, like, I had my phone in my left hand, just holding the faucet up, just thinking I was in the cup, and it wasn't.
[88:39.32]It was in my, it was my robe.
[88:42.86]So how did you not know you were pouring water on yourself?
[88:45.20]Because it wasn't touching me.
[88:46.26]It was just on the robe.
[88:47.62]I have large, very large swooping robe arms.
[88:50.43]So it was going down like the chute for like three seconds and finally like soaked up and went all the way into me and like I had to change.
[88:56.47]So you made like a robe water slide in your arm.
[88:58.43]I made a robe water slide, yeah.
[89:00.35]Okay.
[89:01.69]Funny story.
[89:02.75]That was pretty funny.
[89:03.67]Then you found out and then you had to like change clothes.
[89:05.95]You didn't want to take a shower, but it looks like you took a sink shower.
[89:08.65]Yeah, I know.
[89:09.51]Like, jeez.
[89:11.81]I said that too.
[89:13.09]I took the robe off and I opened up the door.
[89:15.70]I opened up my front door and I was like, oh, Jesus!
[89:18.04]Wait, no, I would have been naked.
[89:21.66]No, I didn't do that.
[89:22.20]I didn't open up the door.
[89:24.47]What is this thing?
[89:25.67]It looks like armor.
[89:27.81]Looks like a suit of banditi armor.
[89:30.61]Do we have a two-handed... I keep dying, so I probably... Yeah, you get that.
[89:34.44]If you have a two-hander or a musket, you get more stuff.
[89:38.62]I don't think these count as two-handed, though.
[89:40.14]Somebody's calling me a liar.
[89:41.56]Maybe they do.
[89:41.92]It's not a lie.
[89:44.53]Yeah, I don't see attack plus five.
[89:45.69]Alright, so just put it on.
[89:49.05]Potion with unknown effects.
[89:50.05]Let's just take it.
[89:51.35]Not right now.
[89:51.93]Bomb.
[89:53.31]Alright, let's keep going.
[89:57.70]Whoops, I just used the book of skin flesh on accident.
[90:01.30]No, I don't want that.
[90:02.04]Can I keep going this way?
[90:04.08]Hopefully I didn't need it for anything.
[90:06.55]Flyer, right.
[90:10.59]You know, I can't do it right now because I actually am naked, like under this rope, and my webcam's not plugged in.
[90:18.20]One day I'll show you this rope, and you're going to be like, wow, actually that makes sense.
[90:21.68]I would have done something like that too if I had a sink.
[90:30.90]I'm taking all the health by the way.
[90:34.35]I'm not sure you're seeing this, but I am.
[90:36.39]Hold on.
[90:40.00]What?
[90:40.30]Whoa!
[90:40.82]I'm inside the cocoon.
[90:46.36]What are you doing?
[90:49.93]Yeah, you're getting... How did you do that?
[90:54.15]Did you write that?
[90:55.25]There's like a communicate with your teammate button.
[91:00.03]I'm just getting so many unnecessary hits right now.
[91:03.33]Stupid piranha plants.
[91:09.80]We have a lot of piranha.
[91:11.20]I have a feeling we're going to get into a situation where we're not going to win.
[91:15.21]That is the point of this game, I think.
[91:16.57]I just got minus one defense.
[91:18.35]That's odd.
[91:22.88]Piranha plants.
[91:23.62]Guys, it's like Super Mario Brothers.
[91:26.74]The piranha plants.
[91:30.86]Don't be next to them when they explode, because they do damage.
[91:33.78]You know this food that you wanted?
[91:35.17]I'm going to take some, but I'm going to eat it.
[91:36.61]Stop throwing bombs.
[91:38.43]I tried to eat the fruit.
[91:39.53]Careful, careful.
[91:41.01]I want to spend these points.
[91:45.31]it was a Mario reference I hate Jerma why wow this looks like a mini boss so uh how do I get this off my screen don't be stupid why is that we're about to both be dead I can't what I I'm doing piano controls not right why why did it just give up on me
[92:14.29]Focus on one at a time.
[92:20.09]How are you still alive?
[92:23.81]He's dead.
[92:24.17]He's dead.
[92:24.55]That guy's definitely dead.
[92:28.94]Careful.
[92:30.14]And spam.
[92:31.74]Are you blocking?
[92:32.42]Is that how you're not taking any damage?
[92:33.94]No, you still get hurt if you block.
[92:39.20]Does the spider spawn out of those?
[92:40.72]Oh, there's another one.
[92:42.04]Oh, those are mines.
[92:46.76]Can this, does this stack?
[92:48.41]It does, okay.
[92:50.55]Oh God, I can't jump over that shit.
[92:51.69]Careful.
[92:53.77]I can't jump over that stuff.
[92:58.03]Okay, taken care of.
[92:59.61]Alright, we, so far so good.
[93:04.01]We're like on the cusp of losing again.
[93:06.15]Why did I call sleeves arm tubes?
[93:09.82]Alright, you get two, and I get two.
[93:11.42]Alright.
[93:13.34]That sounds pretty... We better use them.
[93:14.98]That sounds diplomatic.
[93:15.92]You get two, I get two.
[93:17.39]Yeah, instead of you take all the food again, we're just going to keep going.
[93:24.57]I would give this game a solid...
[93:28.88]Are we rating it already?
[93:30.64]Yeah, you have to rate the game after 40 minutes inside of it.
[93:33.84]It has to be as you go.
[93:35.94]All these reviewers, all these people, all these journalists, they quote journalists.
[93:39.97]They wait till they play the entire game and then they sit down and they take a bath and they're like, did I like that?
[93:45.55]No, you dynamically rate the game.
[93:47.03]So the first two hours of the game, you rate it.
[93:49.98]Middle four hours, you rate it.
[93:51.66]Final three hours, rate it.
[93:52.74]Then you hit the median rating.
[93:54.86]And that's how you end up with how the game actually was.
[94:00.83]I have one hit.
[94:03.17]You have what looks like one hit.
[94:06.67]I think this is gonna be, don't say that yet, maybe the last room before we restart.
[94:13.81]Maybe.
[94:15.75]I'm having fun though.
[94:16.67]I'm actually having fun.
[94:17.39]My stream works.
[94:19.95]Did you hear that everybody?
[94:20.75]His stream works.
[94:21.55]My stream actually works now.
[94:22.88]It's not like broken.
[94:24.02]It's not like messy.
[94:26.16]I didn't get shot with a gun.
[94:27.26]You didn't get shot with a gun.
[94:28.32]Like this game is going fine.
[94:32.46]Let me, uh, let me, like, get in the front.
[94:35.42]I'm gonna be the, uh, tank here.
[94:37.40]No, I'm not.
[94:40.00]Come on, man.
[94:40.52]There's, like, little baby spiders.
[94:41.68]Yeah, but these baby spiders... You can handle it.
[94:43.26]Hey, that's how they sneak up on you.
[94:44.32]They bite you.
[94:47.02]Why are you guys on me?
[94:53.13]You know, I could really do without.
[94:57.03]Let's talk about that.
[94:57.89]You want to do like a podcast here?
[94:59.99]Let's do a video game podcast.
[95:01.19]Yeah, video game podcast.
[95:02.65]Hold on.
[95:03.67]People have been asking that for ages.
[95:05.63]Make sure I don't die.
[95:06.23]I'm serious.
[95:06.99]I'm not even in the game right now.
[95:08.90]You're just walking.
[95:10.26]Oh, boy.
[95:11.40]Where am I?
[95:12.18]Okay.
[95:13.06]You're just walking in place.
[95:14.16]Okay, that's fine.
[95:15.08]Now you're back.
[95:17.28]We're going to do our intro, okay?
[95:20.16]You ready for the podcast intro?
[95:23.94]Here we go.
[95:25.14]So we're going to come up for like, after 10 seconds, we're going to come in, okay?
[95:29.43]The last time I did an interview this long, I was on cocaine.
[95:34.39]That is the ad before this.
[95:40.50]What?
[95:41.92]Why is that an ad?
[95:43.58]Why is that an ad on YouTube?
[95:46.74]Wait, we've got to watch this.
[95:48.10]This is a minute and 45 second ad?
[95:50.22]Give me a break.
[95:51.02]Okay, here we go.
[95:56.24]Oops.
[96:11.35]I can't hear anything right.
[96:13.05]Hey, welcome everybody.
[96:14.51]Check, uh, we're here at the
[96:36.03]We're here at the podcast.
[96:37.17]Welcome to the game, guys.
[96:38.29]My name's John, and I'm here with Dave.
[96:43.97]John and Dave, game guys.
[96:45.15]How you doing?
[96:47.01]Hey, guys.
[96:47.46]How you doing, John?
[96:49.10]I thought you were John.
[96:50.24]Yeah.
[96:50.92]So today, interestingly enough, I saw a couple things on the news pertaining to...
[96:59.16]Yeah, when I was prepping for the podcast today, I basically just went on Reddit and sorted by... Please, before I lose this, what were we just talking about before I did that?
[97:11.37]What?
[97:11.67]I lost it.
[97:12.15]What were we just talking about?
[97:14.51]You were about to do the joke podcast.
[97:16.19]Yeah, but before that, the reason why I started the podcast joke in the first place, what was it?
[97:19.42]What did I say?
[97:19.90]Let's talk about this.
[97:22.18]You didn't give me any information.
[97:23.90]I was like, let's talk about this.
[97:26.04]Well, we're both dead, so you have plenty of time to figure it out.
[97:29.86]Oh, hey, look, Comcast, the rolling brownout has shifted down my stream now, and now I have dropped frames.
[97:40.34]So we're going to play stream C tonight, where we just switch back and forth from one stream to the next.
[97:47.55]Yes, now I am dropping frames.
[97:49.23]Are we talking about rating games?
[97:50.27]No, we're talking about something else.
[97:51.69]Oh, my God.
[97:53.21]I'm about to go watch the bot.
[97:55.50]Is this the podcast joke?
[97:56.86]No, no, no.
[97:57.16]Wait, wait.
[97:57.50]We start the podcast and we don't know what we're supposed to talk about?
[98:00.61]Just put your points in.
[98:01.83]What was the topic today?
[98:02.65]Listen, I just told you I'm dropping frames.
[98:06.63]Oh, God.
[98:07.11]Why?
[98:07.45]Why does Comcast suck?
[98:11.21]How many points do I have?
[98:12.15]I have a bunch.
[98:13.54]Am I going to get to see the bot here?
[98:17.34]Ring?
[98:19.78]Explain to me some of the things you're doing.
[98:22.52]What?
[98:22.68]Are you talking to me?
[98:24.40]Yeah.
[98:24.84]Hold on.
[98:30.33]Alright, here we go.
[98:32.59]The spiders spawn out of those?
[98:33.85]Oh, there's another one.
[98:34.93]Oh, those are mines.
[98:36.33]Look.
[98:37.69]Well, Comcast, and you sort this out.
[98:40.08]You entertain chat for a second.
[98:42.50]I got to go pee.
[98:43.34]You go pee.
[98:43.70]Oh, God.
[98:44.16]I can't jump over that shit.
[98:46.44]Careful.
[98:46.96]I can't jump over that stuff.
[98:49.36]In raiding, that's how you end up with how the game actually was.
[98:52.91]Yep.
[98:55.19]What was next?
[98:56.80]I have one hit.
[98:59.12]You have what looks like one hit.
[99:02.68]I think this is gonna be maybe the last room before we restart.
[99:09.15]I'm having fun though.
[99:12.63]I'm actually having fun.
[99:13.35]My stream works.
[99:15.94]Did you hear that, everybody?
[99:16.70]His stream works.
[99:17.50]My stream actually works now.
[99:18.84]It's not, like, broken.
[99:19.96]It's not, like, messy.
[99:22.10]I didn't get shot with a gun.
[99:23.08]You didn't get shot with a gun.
[99:24.28]Like, this game is going fine.
[99:26.58]No.
[99:26.86]What was it?
[99:28.42]Let me, like, get in the front.
[99:30.66]I'm going to be the tank here.
[99:32.81]Tank?
[99:33.37]No, I'm not.
[99:35.07]Come on, man.
[99:36.33]There's, like, little baby spiders.
[99:37.65]Yeah, but these baby spiders, that's how they sneak up on you.
[99:40.29]They bite you.
[99:41.11]What was I going to say?
[99:42.99]Why are you guys on me?
[99:49.08]You know, I can literally do without.

[101:27.49]I'm going to give you the 3, 2, 1, okay?
[101:28.91]Okay.
[101:29.89]Okay.
[101:43.67]Okay!
[101:46.26]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the game, guys.
[101:49.56]Another Sunday afternoon.
[101:53.82]Welcome again.
[101:54.72]Hopefully you all had a great, happy New Year.
[101:57.91]I know I did.
[101:59.07]Welcome, John.
[102:00.31]John is with us again, as you know.
[102:01.37]Hey, everybody.
[102:02.77]Hey, guys.
[102:02.95]So, I was at Walmart the other day, and first of all, hey, did you have any turkey on Thanksgiving there?
[102:09.87]Yeah, I had plenty of turkey.
[102:10.87]Turkey, dressing, ham, everything.
[102:12.80]Dressing.
[102:13.22]What kind of dressing do you put on there, man?
[102:14.26]We're being relatable and talking about how we're normal people.
[102:18.09]Well, you know, I had some delicious sweet potato casserole.
[102:20.76]Nice, nice, nice.
[102:21.68]Sweet potato casserole.
[102:22.52]How about yourself?
[102:23.00]Did you get to hang out with Susie?
[102:25.14]I did.
[102:25.78]I did.
[102:26.14]Me and Susie went to the Grand Ball, and she wore a dress, and it was nice.
[102:32.50]I wore a tuxedo.
[102:34.51]We're talking about normal, regular people.
[102:36.01]They're like regular people just like you.
[102:38.13]So anyways, I was at Walmart.
[102:40.77]You know Walmart, right?
[102:41.65]They're regular people.
[102:42.27]We shop at regular places just like you.
[102:45.51]I was at Walmart the other day, and I saw a Zelda.
[102:51.06]You know the game Zelda?
[102:52.74]I do.
[102:53.14]Are you a fan of that game?
[102:55.68]Well, you know, whenever somebody tells me about Zelda, I have to just let them know how profoundly it impacted my childhood.
[103:03.43]Right.
[103:03.79]Me too.
[103:06.51]So anyways, I was at line and somebody was... I was in line, I bought the game, I brought the game home and I noticed something really strange about it.
[103:14.50]And let me tell you, let me say how you feel about this, guys.
[103:17.10]So, how come every time Link swings his sword, he has to make noise?
[103:22.28]Do you understand that?
[103:23.56]John, you know what I'm talking about here?
[103:27.37]Every single time.
[103:28.51]At some point, does it get annoying to you?
[103:31.51]Do you find it to be irritating that every single time there has to be a recorded voice line every time you press the attack button?
[103:40.07]What you're referring to is the infamous, like, hi-yah sound effect.
[103:43.95]Yeah, like the hi-yah sound effect.
[103:46.71]What's the deal with that stuff?
[103:47.97]You know what I'm saying?
[103:49.57]Do we really need to have that anymore?
[103:51.09]Let's talk as a community.
[103:52.23]We're all about the community here.
[103:53.71]Give us a call if you agree.
[103:59.49]I'm dead.
[104:04.76]Don't worry.
[104:05.46]I'll get you in a minute.
[104:14.20]Anytime now.
[104:15.10]Are you going to get me?
[104:17.56]No.
[104:20.19]Don't worry, I'm gonna- Man, that's been the game, guys.
[104:23.90]Turn the game vol- Is the game volume that loud?
[104:26.18]What happened?
[104:30.62]Jerma, this joke is not going the way that you think!
[104:34.04]Shh.
[104:36.00]No, none of that.
[104:37.40]Don't even get me started.
[104:40.30]That takes me to a different place.
[104:41.30]What the fuck?
[104:42.03]Why?
[104:43.93]Oh my god!
[104:53.17]I'm like nervous to cross this.
[104:56.85]See, it wasn't hard.
[104:58.43]It was hard.
[104:59.05]It wasn't easy.
[104:59.73]Is it still playing?
[105:04.40]Here's an app.
[105:12.71]What's going on?
[105:13.67]Why is this playing in the background?
[105:19.73]That was auto-playing.
[105:20.87]I'm sorry, Daleks.
[105:22.93]What?
[105:23.27]Why are you sorry?
[105:24.09]I can't hear anything that's happening.
[105:26.21]I'm just like blowing this whole stream right now.
[105:30.03]Alright, so I played that stupid rock song.
[105:33.60]Apparently this is... That's the shit joke that I made.
[105:37.82]Let me turn this off.
[105:41.53]The stream is dying again.
[105:46.41]It's off.
[105:47.05]Pretty sure you can't break this.
[105:48.67]No, you can't break this.
[105:49.33]But if you have a bomb, you have a bomb.
[105:51.25]I do have a bomb.
[105:52.32]I would love to try this.
[105:53.44]I thought I threw it over.
[105:55.20]We need more than... Wait.
[105:56.18]Do we need multiple bombs?
[105:58.24]You probably need more than one bomb.
[105:59.96]You just tripped on your own banana peel.
[106:03.90]And my stream's dead.
[106:06.71]So this is a Comcast-wide issue, it seems.
[106:10.72]Actually, yes.
[106:11.64]I am dropping frames now.
[106:13.35]So, this is not a me problem or a you problem.
[106:15.99]This is a Comcast... I think... No, my stream actually... We made the mistake of using the ISP that is most reviled in the United States.
[106:26.13]Oh.
[106:27.61]Well... Okay.
[106:30.35]Let's... Let's keep going.
[106:33.97]I only dropped like a couple frames, though.
[106:36.57]Yeah, I've dropped 100,000.
[106:41.35]I dropped 100,000 friends.
[106:42.11]100,000.
[106:42.15]Whoa.
[106:42.55]I need to get... I'm going to try to line up over here and get them all in a row.
[106:55.08]Anyways, Dave, in defense of the hi-yah sound effect, I have to say this would be a pretty eerily quiet game without a hi-yah every single time that I push the attack button.
[107:03.80]It would be just a little bit too quiet.
[107:06.89]I just don't understand, John, why there has to be a voice line for every swing.
[107:13.51]It kind of gets annoying.
[107:14.55]Let me ask you this, Dave.
[107:15.87]Have you ever watched women's tennis?
[107:19.17]I don't.
[107:20.05]Well, no, because I don't watch any sports.
[107:23.31]Well, it's a similar situation where when you exert much force, sometimes screeching and yelling can be heard as a result of that exertion.
[107:31.97]Okay.
[107:33.29]So, if anything, the hi-yah sound effect when exerting such leverage over especially hand-to-hand combat weapons, you're going to find that hi-yah is just a natural sound.
[107:42.48]It's an occurrence that happens in nature.
[107:44.70]We can find examples in the guerrilla world.
[107:48.68]Are you on webcam right now?
[107:50.24]No.
[107:50.74]You're not.
[107:51.20]Okay, I was going to say, please swing as hard as you can and see if you make any noise.
[107:57.63]Yay, back to the joke that's not funny.
[108:03.43]We have to fill time here because our streams aren't working.
[108:09.07]I'm going to get Magilnir.
[108:13.74]What the hell is that?
[108:14.72]Did you just get... What did you call it?
[108:16.74]I don't know.
[108:19.44]Mjolnir?
[108:20.00]It's Mjolnir.
[108:22.68]Oh.
[108:23.54]This guy hasn't even seen Thor.
[108:26.90]Actually, you know the answer to that question.
[108:28.54]I've never seen Thor.
[108:30.44]It was not a question.
[108:31.39]It was just this guy has never seen Thor.
[108:33.61]Well, that is technically kind of a question.
[108:36.43]Hey, how is your stream doing?
[108:38.27]Are you at more than a 500K up?
[108:40.41]Yes.
[108:41.01]Well, I am at 4,600 kilobits per second.
[108:47.31]Cool.
[108:48.91]This has been a great stream tonight.
[108:50.95]We've had lots of fun.
[108:52.33]I am in the green, actually.
[108:53.99]Alright, which one do you want?
[108:55.14]Piggy bank?
[108:57.80]Every one gold you hold won by every 20 gold.
[109:01.64]Alright, well, I have more money, so I should take that one.
[109:05.47]Okay.
[109:06.05]So you take the weird tech.
[109:07.35]The wearer can release erosion at the cost of hit points.
[109:11.43]That's actually what the title is.
[109:12.65]I said, grab the weird tentacle, and that's the name of this item.
[109:16.96]That's weird.
[109:18.56]Weird, man.
[109:19.06]Watch out.
[109:19.64]Wow, weird.
[109:20.12]You're going to get exploded if you stand that close.
[109:21.68]Wow.
[109:24.62]That's a dangerous game you're playing.
[109:25.68]Okay, you're good.
[109:27.46]I didn't even read and see what Mjolnir does.
[109:30.91]You just have it.
[109:32.27]I just own it.
[109:33.55]Okay.
[109:34.69]Mjolnir.
[109:35.65]Mjolnir.
[109:38.95]This is a great flip book stream.
[109:43.86]You know what it is?
[109:44.30]It's probably like the... Well, no, that doesn't make any sense.
[109:46.80]Because I was going to say it's the cold weather maybe, but that's not the case without a doubt.
[109:55.35]It's the cold weather.
[109:56.39]That's why my stream is lagging.
[109:57.53]Yeah, that's why your stream is lagging.
[110:01.14]You know how, like, when you go outside and your allergies kick off when it's the first of winter?
[110:05.76]Hey, watch out.
[110:09.08]Watch out for, like, the children's Halloween costume, uh, B-Max.
[110:12.88]What's his name?
[110:14.55]What's his name?
[110:14.89]The guy from Big Hero 6?
[110:15.71]I haven't seen that movie.
[110:18.21]Betamax?
[110:18.67]What's the guy's name?
[110:21.25]BMO?
[110:24.61]Oh, that joke would have been funnier if, uh... What were his names?
[110:32.35]The stream is still like this.
[110:33.77]Yeah.
[110:34.93]I'm trying to ride it out.
[110:36.35]Internet pipes are freezing over.
[110:47.43]Wooden chest.
[110:49.01]Betamax.
[110:51.15]The audio and visuals are all desynced.
[110:53.17]That's because I'm currently dealing with an internet problem.
[110:56.53]You know what?
[111:00.53]Sure.
[111:02.92]uh okay well not well mjolnir makes this uh 10 times stronger I think hey look I got I got I got some treats for you this thing's actually really cool you ready for this you ready yeah what how'd you do that
[111:20.17]Hey, no, give me that one back.
[111:21.39]Just take, give me the thing back.
[111:23.11]No, not all the apples.
[111:24.05]I want, I was just, I was just showing you how many I had.
[111:25.85]Oh, oh, I thought you, like, opened up a box or something.
[111:28.29]No, that was all, those were all my items.
[111:30.07]Oh.
[111:30.25]You can have, like, half of them because you're low on health.
[111:32.42]Okay, here, well, I'm going to eat these.
[111:33.22]You keep the apples.
[111:34.78]Okay, and you can have the, the, the man.
[111:36.56]No, I've got enough.
[111:37.54]What is this thing?
[111:40.84]Uh, if you get, uh, poisoned or something, it cures you.
[111:43.28]Alright, well, that's fine.
[111:44.06]Let's go.
[111:47.37]Is it fixed?
[111:47.95]I hope.
[111:48.23]I don't know.
[111:48.53]I hope so.
[111:49.91]It's been really up and down this whole entire night.
[111:52.53]That's so stupid.
[111:53.78]In more ways than one.
[111:55.66]Oh, yeah.
[111:55.92]But, you know, we're having fun.
[111:58.18]We can skip this.
[111:58.84]We've already seen this before.
[111:59.86]This game is infinitely better than the last game.
[112:04.48]Oh, yeah.
[112:05.48]I have to stand still for this.
[112:08.38]It's not even really worth doing.
[112:09.38]I'm just going to keep doing that.
[112:13.06]You're supposed to dodge when you're this slow.
[112:17.26]Because I'm not Naruto running.
[112:18.54]I don't have enough speed.
[112:19.44]Oh, please.
[112:21.32]He's hungry.
[112:21.66]He's going to dive.
[112:25.62]And there he goes.
[112:27.00]This doesn't really do that much damage.
[112:30.29]That hurt.
[112:36.67]We are going to lose.
[112:37.65]Yes, we are.
[112:38.09]We're both too slow.
[112:46.17]No, I got stuck in the corner.
[112:47.83]That would be so funny if you tripped.
[112:51.15]I would think this was a 75 out of 70.
[112:53.24]I would find this a fun game.
[113:00.54]I honestly have to just run away and then dive.
[113:06.44]Honestly, you know what I'm missing in video games so far?
[113:11.24]What if I happen to the guys blinking?
[113:13.24]What if I happen to the bosses blinking?
[113:14.84]That means you're getting close to winning.
[113:17.29]Oh, like flashing red?
[113:18.75]Yeah, remember Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
[113:21.31]When you would get Baxter down to 10% health, he would start blinking, and then blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink.
[113:27.64]I'd rather that.
[113:29.46]Get this hug, get the health bars off the screen, bring back the blinking enemies.
[113:32.74]Well, at least he flashes when you do damage to him.
[113:39.07]We're good.
[113:43.11]Ow.
[113:44.17]Don't worry, I'll just take all that.
[113:46.97]right what's in the master chest a lot of stuff uh another suit of armor uh dagger this is a two-handed thing forbidden book careful when you open this okay I'll be careful 10 HP uh you just grab that you take the barbarian armor
[114:08.88]barbarian armor yeah but it just looks like it's it's for like up front tank people right it's got plus 30 health plus six defense I get well I mean it I guess it's just huge fine I'll take the health we'll compare the stats to the other thing yeah do you want the mithril sword no I I'll stick with the uh the two-hander 200 is good I don't know I think I think I'll stick with range for now but it's ruined yeah
[114:34.14]Well, don't worry.
[114:34.78]There ain't gonna be a really watchable VOD from this one.
[114:38.76]Sorry, guys.
[114:39.50]I go like this.
[114:42.90]I spin around.
[114:54.11]No, I meant like with the sword and shield when I hit trigger.
[114:57.37]So when you right trigger, it just gives you like a little overheal and it gets stacked.
[115:04.23]And if you hold Y, it just blocks.
[115:06.23]It doesn't block all damage, it only blocks like a percentage.
[115:09.35]Let's go.
[115:12.70]I'm a little hurt right now.
[115:15.96]This is a really nice still video.
[115:19.53]You know what?
[115:20.16]We're going to play this game again at some point here, right?
[115:24.06]Don't you feel like we need to beat this game on video?
[115:26.26]I feel like this is a beatable game.
[115:27.92]This is a beatable video game.
[115:28.96]This is not an early access doesn't work game.
[115:31.50]No.
[115:31.82]The game works.
[115:33.23]The game works.
[115:33.75]Our streams just don't.
[115:35.31]That's the problem.
[115:43.09]I like that one.
[115:47.03]Yeah, sorry, guys.
[115:48.41]I uploaded the... What's the idea?
[115:52.17]Hold on.
[115:52.43]Wait right there.
[115:53.15]Okay.
[115:55.95]What's your idea?
[115:56.83]I was gonna... I was gonna see if there was a sound setting to turn off vocals, and we could just try seeing how awkward the game sounds without, like, the high up.
[116:09.98]That would be pretty awkward.
[116:14.95]Without the Hayao, it would be pretty weird.
[116:22.16]Because it is like 85% of the sound.
[116:24.04]It doesn't have an actual... Well, at that point, just turn all the sound off.
[116:32.54]I have been captured.
[116:34.10]I think I'm about to use the book.
[116:35.62]I'm captured twice.
[116:36.30]I'm going to use the book and see what happens.
[116:39.79]Polymorph.
[116:40.51]Well, that's a mass polymorph.
[116:42.03]That actually is pretty useful.
[116:43.41]Remember that for next time.
[116:49.99]Okay, when they come out of Polymorph, it's a little dangerous.
[116:52.93]I have this weird lady that's dropping money behind me.
[116:57.13]Take advantage of it.
[116:59.31]Grab the money.
[116:59.81]How long does she last?
[117:05.23]I don't know.
[117:06.60]Maybe she just follows you around and thinks dying.
[117:08.86]That'd be amazing.
[117:09.52]Alright, watch out for this guy.
[117:12.90]Really?
[117:13.22]I tried to... What happened to your head?
[117:14.46]I don't know.
[117:16.06]I got like... Whatever those ten...
[117:21.35]No, that was you.
[117:22.42]That was you.
[117:22.78]I'm going out with a bang when he comes back here.
[117:26.34]I'm going to spin into him.
[117:28.64]You will not get that chance.
[117:33.12]And open.
[117:33.70]There better be a lot of food in here.
[117:37.42]Yes, there is.
[117:40.62]You want the medallion?
[117:41.32]I can have one banana.
[117:42.98]Fire a bolt of pure magic.
[117:45.45]This action will exhaust the magic of this pendant.
[117:48.41]Okay.
[117:51.25]Well, how about this?
[117:54.33]If this doesn't start to correct itself here, then we kind of have to stop streaming.
[118:01.11]We've been going for a couple hours now.
[118:03.41]It looks like it's not going to stay put.
[118:07.04]For whatever reason, mine's stable now.
[118:09.78]I don't know.
[118:11.96]All I know is it's... Oh boy, you're dead.
[118:17.50]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[118:18.38]I've only dropped 1,600 frames total.
[118:22.00]I dropped way more than that.
[118:23.94]You dropped like 160,000.
[118:24.90]A lot.
[118:25.44]This time I don't want to blow it.
[118:34.73]I got cocooned.
[118:35.79]Oh boy, this is not good.
[118:37.27]Get me out of there!
[118:44.27]Hello?
[118:44.86]Woo!
[118:48.56]Why?
[118:48.78]Will you please give me one second?
[118:49.86]Don't just sprint around.
[118:50.74]He's going to do it again.
[118:53.08]Oh boy.
[118:54.70]Don't do it.
[118:54.98]Comcast likes me better.
[118:56.30]Yeah, they do.
[118:57.16]For some reason.
[118:59.42]Ah!
[119:03.16]This time.
[119:03.68]Game over.
[119:05.04]This time.
[119:07.28]I'm not going to not spend the points.
[119:12.95]Got to watch me first.
[119:13.85]So let's watch you first.
[119:16.17]I've been going down the potion tree.
[119:18.01]What is this?
[119:18.61]Better crucible.
[119:20.46]Oh, we have to talk to the pharmacist and we get free potions.
[119:22.83]Okay.
[119:24.05]But isn't this just for you?
[119:26.39]I think we both get to use it.
[119:29.05]Restore more health when eating food.
[119:30.75]Okay.
[119:32.93]There.
[119:33.63]Too bad resetting the router isn't a potential fix.
[119:35.68]No.
[119:37.46]I think that's all I can do.
[119:39.88]I've had this issue with Comcast like a hundred times now.
[119:43.28]There's been times when I haven't been able to stream for like a full two weeks.
[119:48.27]Alright, what we got here?
[119:48.89]Increase attack damage.
[119:50.41]Yeah, I'll do that.
[119:51.03]What does it cost?
[119:52.45]14.
[119:52.47]Alright, I got some points here.
[119:55.91]Oh, we're back down.
[120:16.38]Alright, it's time to Unfortunately guys I Think how are you doing?
[120:23.30]Are you still alright?
[120:25.44]Yeah, I'm still okay.

[120:43.17]I pay extra.
[120:45.15]Yeah, we pay extra.
[120:47.00]We pay extra.
[120:47.84]I pay extra to be able to stream.
[120:49.08]You know, with that net neutrality, I gotta pay extra to get that twitch.tv functionality.
[120:54.82]Gotta go on the highway.
[120:56.61]I've... Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.
[121:01.31]When I look down at my OBS and I see that 30% of every frame has dropped, it gets to a point where I just don't want to do it.
[121:09.48]It's just not going to happen.
[121:16.20]Sometimes it works for a minute or two and then it stops working for 15 minutes.
[121:20.18]Are you shitting on the ground?
[121:28.27]At least we got to see that, right?
[121:34.49]It's done.
[121:35.07]It's done.
[121:35.55]That's all.
[121:35.97]Wait, wait, wait.
[121:36.67]You weren't controlling that.
[121:37.53]Too many bananas in my diet.
[121:40.10]Get too much fiber.
[121:41.32]Oh, Lord.
[121:41.78]No, wait.
[121:43.86]It's good.
[121:44.36]No, it ain't.
[121:45.16]It's dead.
[121:47.20]It's dead in the water.
[121:58.25]Well, Etalyx.
[122:00.01]Would you like to do a rain check?
[122:04.38]Uh, we can.
[122:05.58]If you want to pause it for later.
[122:09.00]What's your, um... What's your plan over the next, like, couple days, Etalyx?
[122:15.84]What's your plan?
[122:17.16]What is your plan tomorrow?
[122:20.54]Uh... None streaming related.
[122:24.08]None streaming related.
[122:26.37]Would you like to kind of postpone this until either, like, till tomorrow or until Thursday?
[122:34.14]Do you want to do, like, one more life?
[122:37.96]I'm at, like, 0k right now.
[122:40.52]We can.
[122:41.02]I mean, I'm going to have to turn my stream off.
[122:44.02]It's up to you.
[122:48.42]Let's just... I'm going to just turn my stream off.
[122:53.05]And we'll do another life on yours, and we'll just go from there.
[122:57.59]Okay.
[122:59.24]Alright, guys.
[123:00.22]My stream is turning off.
[123:02.36]So, I'm sorry.
[123:04.96]Me and Etalyx are going to do at least one more life on his stream.
[123:08.52]Because this is not watchable.
[123:13.46]So, thank you for watching.
[123:16.52]I would say a lot more things, but let's just get the show rolling here.
[123:22.92]I might just stream tomorrow.
[123:25.32]We are not allowed to have a smooth...
[123:30.05]stream unless it's local only.
[123:32.03]It's true, I know.
[123:33.55]But if for some reason I don't stream tomorrow or we don't do it again tomorrow, then I'll see you on Thursday.
