[00:57.06]Hi, everybody.
[00:59.28]Welcome to the stream.
[01:02.22]How are you?
[01:04.34]I hope you guys had a great New Year's.
[01:07.38]I know I did.
[01:08.02]Hey, on to 2019, right?
[01:10.71]There's only three days in a year.
[01:17.45]January 1st is the New Year.
[01:19.05]January 2nd is middle time.
[01:21.93]And January 3rd is New Year's Eve.
[01:27.20]We're in the year 68 million, 945 trillion.
[01:29.08]Mm-hmm.
[01:29.48]I'm seeing a lot of, uh... I'm seeing a lot of great memes over here.
[01:40.52]And that's okay.
[01:42.40]This is the only time you're ever gonna be able to use them.
[01:45.41]So I can't wait for the, uh... I can't wait for the stream chat to be, you know, great tonight!
[01:51.69]This is the meme funeral.
[01:58.93]So say your prayers for these jokes.
[02:03.51]Because we're currently grabbing the casket and just lowering them in.
[02:08.54]You know?
[02:21.13]So many people are just... Okay, at this point, you guys are combining them.
[02:24.91]You're just combining them.
[02:29.18]Life is O-W-O.
[02:32.67]I germacraft hate pain.
[02:34.25]Like, you can't do that.
[02:36.35]Just because you're allowed to do something doesn't mean you should do it.
[02:39.81]Anyways, we're going to play with the Talics tonight.
[02:42.68]We might have, this might be just like a quick little fun, hey, what's going on, buddy stream.
[02:48.18]We have a couple of potential things to do.
[02:49.94]We want to try this game.
[02:50.74]This game just came out.
[02:52.48]This could be a utter, utter disaster.
[02:55.03]We don't know.
[02:57.08]We haven't even watched anything on it.
[02:58.42]We just saw that it was available, and we're like, okay.
[03:01.54]It's called Lynch.
[03:03.87]If you know, the... If you guys remember when I played Resident Evil 7, where you played that card game versus another person, and if you did something wrong, you got your character gets, like, murdered.
[03:17.43]It's like that.
[03:18.01]Essentially, these guys took that Resident Evil 7 DLC, and now it's a full game.
[03:25.49]I guess.
[03:26.76]We'll see.
[03:28.32]I have no idea.
[03:30.26]But just let me get another minute or so, so me and Italics can sync up here.
[03:35.80]And we'll get started.
[03:37.62]Give us a minute.
[04:20.17]There.
[04:20.71]Hey.
[04:21.29]Okay.
[04:22.37]Hey, hey, hey!
[04:23.15]There he is!
[04:24.33]Hey, everybody!
[04:26.19]Wow, I can't believe, uh, Jerma was nice enough to set up a stream PC inside of his basement for me.
[04:32.72]Yeah, I know.
[04:33.58]There's, like, he's been here the whole time.
[04:36.06]It gets a little hot in here because the room's so small, but... Other than that, it's okay.
[04:42.05]Are you, uh, are you, like, in the game?
[04:44.87]I am in the game.
[04:46.53]Oh god, okay.
[04:47.62]Well, here we go.
[04:48.62]Oh, but first of all, hold on a second!
[04:52.10]It was the aliens, thanks for the ten bucks.
[04:53.74]Dying the Jerma mites will have to find a refuge on Jerma Mars.
[04:58.04]Well, thank you, it was the aliens.
[05:00.08]For your alien-inspired comment.
[05:03.06]And the ten bucks.
[05:04.74]Alright, I'm ready.
[05:08.66]Alright.
[05:09.16]Let's change this over here.
[05:09.86]Alright, so should I... Are you in a game?
[05:13.29]I am in a game.
[05:14.35]Okay.
[05:14.93]Starting now.
[05:18.01]Should we like read the rules first?
[05:20.85]Okay, yeah, let's read.
[05:21.65]Is there a rule book?
[05:22.83]I think there's like a rule book.
[05:23.91]Ah, there is a rule book.
[05:27.27]Wait, this is no server's fun.
[05:29.75]That's because I went to the rule book.
[05:31.42]Oh, well, can't we read the rule book in the server?
[05:35.24]It seems to be like a main menu thing only.
[05:37.26]Okay.
[05:37.78]I'm switching over to the main menu.
[05:41.40]Is it a main menu thing?
[05:43.69]It is.
[05:44.05]There's a rules thing on the main menu.
[05:46.63]Yeah.
[05:46.79]Have you mentioned what this game is?
[05:48.98]Yes, yes.
[05:50.10]I've briefly mentioned what this is.
[05:52.06]Okay.
[05:52.78]Because I have not.
[05:55.42]It's just death cards.
[05:57.82]Yeah.
[05:58.72]If you play the Resident Evil 7 DLC, it's one of the DLCs is you play cards against another person.
[06:05.77]And if you screw up or if something bad happens, the other person, like, dies.
[06:10.95]I guess.
[06:11.27]Yeah.
[06:11.72]It's a pretty low stakes game.
[06:14.33]You know, this is like an early access.
[06:16.11]We just like saw it and like, okay, that's pretty much it.
[06:19.69]Oh, there's rules.
[06:20.41]Okay.
[06:21.33]There are rules.
[06:21.97]There are 36 rules.
[06:23.49]Well, I can't read the rules for more than five seconds.
[06:25.37]No, there's 36 standard cards.
[06:26.89]All right, so we've got 36 rules and there's two jokers.
[06:29.47]So we're allowed to make two jokes.
[06:33.15]Okay, so, Talix, you go ahead and read this because my brain can't do it.
[06:38.72]All right, there's 22 bonus cards.
[06:40.86]The bonuses go into a separate pocket that's not your hand.
[06:43.60]Okay.
[06:44.44]Some cards are activated immediately.
[06:46.94]You can only hold three of these 22 bonus cards at one time.
[06:50.05]Okay.
[06:51.01]If you exceed that limit, you have to get rid of one.
[06:54.43]So you can hold three bonus cards.
[06:56.98]If you have depression, you lose 10 HP.
[06:59.90]My hand is burning.
[07:00.82]What is my hand is burning?
[07:02.02]What does that mean?
[07:03.66]Okay.
[07:17.56]To avoid damage from the ace, you can beat it with the sixth of matching suit with the Joker or use suitable bonus.
[07:24.32]Okay, dude, this is like a Star Wars scroll of rules here.
[07:28.49]I can't even see the bottom of it.
[07:29.69]It stops being written after a certain point.
[07:33.29]No, it doesn't.
[07:33.95]It keeps going, man.
[07:35.01]It shows you every single rule.
[07:36.79]Oh, my God.
[07:37.59]Hey, and you can scroll.
[07:39.31]Okay, there's a lot of things here.
[07:40.61]Oh, there you go.
[07:41.01]You have to scroll up to go down.
[07:42.93]It's more than 36 rules.
[07:43.43]Okay.
[07:48.08]Is there no tutorial for this game?
[07:50.30]No, you can't do that.
[07:51.22]Look, as long as you steal... I want to get the Leonardo and Michelangelo and you steal a random bonus.
[07:56.61]You know what?
[07:57.99]We didn't figure out how to play this game because... I would have expected it to be so... To be so complicated.
[08:02.91]How about we just do this?
[08:03.65]I'm going to join your game.
[08:05.85]We've got to play at least one just to see what happens.
[08:07.73]Okay, lobby list.
[08:08.88]Do you have a game open?
[08:10.90]I do.
[08:11.82]Okay, good.
[08:13.36]I just created a lobby.
[08:15.06]Let's see if I can find Italics' game.
[08:20.57]I'm currently searching.
[08:22.47]Friends only?
[08:23.01]No, I don't think I have that.
[08:24.65]How did you get in last time?
[08:26.79]Literally, your name just popped up.
[08:27.91]Okay.
[08:29.61]Did you make a game?
[08:30.95]I did.
[08:31.55]I am sitting here looking at my hands.
[08:33.24]Okay, hold on.
[08:34.66]Examining this wonderful man who's overseeing the game that we're about to play.
[08:41.96]Did you play with somebody else?
[08:43.58]No, it's just me and the host.
[08:46.22]How did I get into your game last time?
[08:48.27]We did it literally 20 minutes ago.
[08:50.06]Yeah, I know.
[08:52.68]Talix, you're quiet on Jerma's dream.
[08:54.74]It's just a quiet little mouse.
[08:56.22]Is this going to be a mouse?
[08:58.76]Okay, there's nobody else playing this game, so I'm going to click on the play button.
[09:04.58]Let's see.
[09:07.33]I'm going to get a League of Legends queue.
[09:13.95]We did test this out before the stream.
[09:15.49]We literally tested this out before the stream.
[09:17.37]Hold on, let me see something.
[09:18.71]Let me raise your volume a little.
[09:21.96]Let me raise your dongers a little, right?
[09:25.26]Are you still just waiting?
[09:26.92]Uh-huh.
[09:28.06]It's just me and the guy.
[09:28.80]He's being very patient with me.
[09:30.84]He's being very patient with you.
[09:32.30]I'm going to restart the game.
[09:34.66]Okay.
[09:36.82]I can try to invite you.
[09:39.02]Hold on.
[09:39.34]If it doesn't work this time, then yeah, we'll try that.
[09:44.06]okay sorry for the uh technical difficulties but you know we did just test this you know oh so dingo all right let's do it play lobby list hey look at that all right I'm joining am I here I see ice I see movement there you are
[10:14.95]That's what your face says to me.
[10:18.37]You have someone else's face stitched onto your face.
[10:22.01]Yeah, we both have stitched on faces, apparently.
[10:27.14]He thinks it's really funny.
[10:29.90]He's excited about the game.
[10:31.38]Oh, we got cards.
[10:31.90]Oh, we actually have cards.
[10:33.14]Yes, I've got Donatello, and I'm looking at it, and I kind of want to pick it up.
[10:37.39]I can't even see what this says.
[10:39.92]This looks like somebody has their face in spaghetti sauce.
[10:42.20]He's now on the table.
[10:43.24]Alright, I'm gonna put your face in some spaghetti sauce.
[10:45.53]How do I do it?
[10:47.05]Like this?
[10:49.61]Transfer attack back to no.
[10:51.31]I'm like.
[10:52.41]How do we do this?
[10:53.09]Do I have to put this into your deck?
[10:55.71]I played a jack.
[10:56.77]What's the jack?
[10:58.17]It's in the middle of the table now.
[10:59.53]Okay, so that means I'm gonna play like please chiropractic fix my back.
[11:04.47]Oh my god.
[11:06.19]How did you place it?
[11:07.53]I just clicked it again in the middle of the table.
[11:09.91]How does this game?
[11:10.69]How about the king?
[11:15.36]I also got this nice Mutant Ninja Turtle coaster.
[11:19.73]Alright, so you played a jack.
[11:21.39]I did.
[11:21.75]I'm waiting on you to figure out how to play.
[11:25.25]My jack is gone, and now I have a queen.
[11:27.29]Okay, that's great.
[11:31.24]I believe he just cut your dick off.
[11:37.22]What?
[11:40.34]How did you do that?
[11:42.09]I believe he just reached down with gardening scissors.
[11:45.11]Alright, well, fuck this.
[11:45.77]Yeah, how about this?
[11:47.65]You're gonna eat some spaghetti.
[11:50.23]Now I was waiting on you.
[11:54.99]What did you just do?
[11:56.03]I don't know, like, vanish the cards.
[11:57.73]I guess I canceled your side.
[11:59.09]I put a queen out.
[12:00.21]Oh, well, let me see this.
[12:02.63]Are we playing war?
[12:03.83]I think this, is this war?
[12:05.85]It's your turn.
[12:07.01]It's my turn again, okay.
[12:10.03]Alright, what is that?
[12:11.52]Is that the please drink out of the faucet?
[12:13.54]Can you see us?
[12:14.86]It is the please drink out of the faucet.
[12:17.18]So I played an 8.
[12:17.74]Let's try to figure out what happens when you play a card.
[12:20.02]Okay, I can't play any cards.
[12:25.68]You just left click it once, then it picks it up.
[12:28.58]Then you look over the middle and left click it one more time.
[12:31.15]That's what I'm trying to do with any of my cards.
[12:33.89]You don't click, hold, and let go.
[12:35.47]You click it, then click it again.
[12:37.41]I'm clicking and letting go over here.
[12:43.95]You're too slow.
[12:45.37]Apparently.
[12:46.47]Look, there you go.
[12:47.59]Now you're going to get kicked in the face.
[12:49.03]I give a six.
[12:52.17]All right, you've played a six.
[12:53.83]So wait, you can play cards?
[12:57.29]Yeah.
[12:58.43]But like, I'm gonna play... an eight.
[13:02.71]So you can't.
[13:04.82]Uh... Well, now I can't.
[13:06.08]Maybe you have to play like a... Let's see what happens when I play the joker.
[13:09.72]Joker's gotta be wild.
[13:11.24]How come you get... Where do you get all these jokers from?
[13:13.24]And now you get to play a card.
[13:14.34]That means I'm gonna get my back broken again.
[13:16.14]What is T?
[13:17.66]I don't know.
[13:18.62]What does T stand for?
[13:25.03]What are you doing?
[13:25.93]What is that?
[13:26.55]What is up down?
[13:27.73]What does the elevator mean?
[13:28.61]I'm up down on you right now.
[13:31.51]You're about to drink some tea.
[13:33.25]I just transferred that back onto you.
[13:34.79]Hey, I'm rubber and your glue, whatever you say, sticks onto me and then jumps back on you.
[13:37.87]Okay.
[13:43.47]Why do you keep doing that?
[13:44.67]Six cancels that.
[13:46.17]Oh my god.
[13:46.91]Because I'm going to win.
[13:49.25]What is this one?
[13:49.75]This one is like stab the referee.
[13:52.27]I don't want that one.
[13:53.95]That's the king.
[13:55.37]Let's go with shatter your elbow.
[13:58.21]Two of my cards involve either slamming you in the nuts or drilling you in the nuts.
[14:06.55]Either one.
[14:06.89]Okay.
[14:11.06]Alright, so what is that, a nine?
[14:12.22]Is this VR though?
[14:13.50]It seems like it should be though.
[14:15.76]So I played a nine.
[14:17.18]I upped you with a queen.
[14:19.04]Okay, so if you played a queen.
[14:20.43]I played a red queen though.
[14:21.93]So what if I do like a king?
[14:26.89]Try like a red king.
[14:28.79]Uh, okay.
[14:30.25]No, I don't know what just happened.
[14:32.96]It wouldn't let me pick anything up.
[14:36.44]Hmm.
[14:38.86]Didn't read the rules.
[14:42.29]Alright, so what did you play?
[14:43.49]A king?
[14:44.21]I played a red king.
[14:45.75]He's like a skull with a crown on his head.
[14:50.13]Good luck, buddy.
[14:51.09]Maybe I can play a king.
[14:52.46]No.
[14:58.88]Do-do-do.
[15:00.40]Do I have any queens?
[15:02.96]I can't even pick this up.
[15:05.77]I think it is the way... You're gonna be killed.
[15:08.65]I'm gonna die.
[15:09.53]Your character's definitely dead.
[15:11.03]I couldn't even... I can't even, like, fucking do anything.
[15:15.71]Every time I try to click... Am I dead?
[15:18.84]Your eyes, like, came out of the socket.
[15:20.74]Every time I try to pick up a card, I can't even click the fucking thing.
[15:23.78]Alright, well, here.
[15:24.46]Time to die.
[15:25.66]That's the death card.
[15:29.76]That is a guy with a skeleton with a hood on.
[15:36.57]It is looking that way.
[15:37.49]I think I do have a play, though.
[15:39.61]What's your play?
[15:40.11]I just don't know which... How do you activate your trap cards?
[15:46.64]The bottom ones?
[15:47.10]You just pick them up.
[15:50.02]My turn.
[15:50.52]Did I kill you?
[15:55.51]Are you dead?
[15:56.45]I think I'm still alive.
[15:57.93]I believe I was just hit in the face with a machete.
[15:59.75]Yeah, that was a machete.
[16:01.69]Okay.
[16:02.35]Alright, your turn.
[16:02.87]Um...
[16:07.22]This is so strange.
[16:09.08]Alright, that's a queen.
[16:11.14]You can hit Q to zoom in, by the way.
[16:13.00]Oh, Q zooms in.
[16:14.74]Oh, alright.
[16:15.77]Let's take your heart out.
[16:19.31]Is that really not how this works?
[16:21.85]Like, I can't play a king?
[16:23.71]What about a jack?
[16:25.94]That's not how this works.
[16:27.98]What about just a regular king?
[16:29.71]There we go, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[16:31.95]I could have played like the Moby King or I could have played like Baratheon King and apparently that was the correct one.
[16:42.45]I have like three bonuses down here.
[16:43.83]I don't know how to use them.
[16:44.85]All right, I'm gonna like carve you like a cake.
[16:48.14]No.
[16:52.20]What is that?
[16:52.56]Oh, no, you're gonna brand me.
[16:54.70]That's like a brand.
[16:55.70]Oh, okay.
[16:59.94]Why do we have the handsome jack faces?
[17:02.90]It has to be matching suits, okay.
[17:06.30]But so is that, is this actually like, so that's a, okay, I get it, I get it, I'm starting to understand.
[17:12.97]All right, well let's go with the turkey look.
[17:18.31]I can like zoom in on you and I can like see you thinking.
[17:23.15]Just pretend we have VR helmets on, yeah.
[17:25.25]Hit Q and zoom into me, this is what you're doing.
[17:29.51]I don't know.
[17:31.53]Which one of these cards am I going to play?
[17:35.83]Oh, wait.
[17:36.27]It's your turn.
[17:36.73]It was my turn?
[17:37.77]I guess you took too long.
[17:39.29]Oh, hold on.
[17:45.33]Oh, we have health.
[17:48.57]What, did you just punch me?
[17:50.11]Did I just get punched?
[17:51.43]You got, we both got, I think he hit both of us.
[17:53.39]Okay, so that, I just like accidentally made us both get hurt.
[17:57.13]You have 49 health, I have 70.
[17:58.67]I'm gonna go with the screaming guy with the arrows.
[18:01.99]Screaming guy with the arrows, that's a diamond.
[18:04.21]I'm gonna try playing an eight.
[18:06.23]No, it's got, I think it's got the same suit.
[18:07.52]It's the same suit, that's the same suit, but it's a lower card.
[18:11.60]So what if I try a king in a different suit?
[18:14.76]No.
[18:15.42]Do I have anything?
[18:17.06]I don't think you can do anything about this.
[18:19.55]Unless you have a bonus card.
[18:20.47]Unless you get a bonus play here, I think I win.
[18:22.61]How do I do bonus?
[18:24.14]Before your turn.
[18:25.32]I think you have to... Well, let's see what happens.
[18:26.66]Do you know?
[18:30.58]My turn.
[18:31.22]Oh, my God.
[18:31.86]That's... Well, now we're both dickless.
[18:38.69]What the fuck, man?
[18:40.37]What...
[18:41.96]Oh my god!
[18:43.80]Now neither of us have anything.
[18:45.08]Okay, well, that's fantastic.
[18:47.82]Is this the train to the eunuch station?
[18:52.14]I have no idea what the hell's going on.
[18:53.68]What the hell is T?
[18:56.99]T, this is not a card in a... That's not a card!
[19:00.61]Alright, that's a king of... I don't even know.
[19:08.29]What does T even stand for?
[19:10.76]What does T stand for?
[19:15.12]I'm so close to death.
[19:17.14]You have 29 health left, yeah.
[19:20.45]He's not happy with you.
[19:21.59]No, he's not.
[19:25.15]Is it my turn?
[19:26.19]It is your turn, yes.
[19:27.81]You can probably play whatever you want.
[19:29.21]Yeah, well, how about the guy eating the turkey leg?
[19:31.23]That looks like a good one.
[19:33.45]Good luck.
[19:35.51]Okay, seven of diamonds?
[19:36.61]I can beat that.
[19:38.15]Eight of diamonds.
[19:39.17]Oh, God.
[19:41.05]Oh, yeah?
[19:43.11]Nine of diamonds.
[19:47.27]Pick up the card.
[19:49.33]Oh, yeah?
[19:50.69]No.
[19:54.07]Oh, yeah?
[19:55.49]I'm waiting.
[19:56.69]Oh, yeah?
[19:58.55]No, that's not what I wanted.
[19:59.63]I want this.
[20:00.43]Nine of diamonds.
[20:02.05]He's going to kill you.
[20:02.73]Nine of diamonds.
[20:04.07]Nine...
[20:06.20]I can't pick it up.
[20:08.30]I was trying so desperately to get this nine of diamonds.
[20:14.54]Alright, now I can pick it up.
[20:16.98]That's a heart.
[20:17.78]What is that, a six?
[20:19.82]That is a six of hearts.
[20:22.60]You're about to get clubbed.
[20:25.64]What else can you play besides same suit?
[20:27.73]I don't know.
[20:28.07]I think we might have done this wrong.
[20:33.61]Yeah, this is just... What is that?
[20:35.60]I just threw a seven of clubs out.
[20:37.68]Why?
[20:38.10]What?
[20:38.42]I think I... I don't know.
[20:39.18]I matched your number in a different suit, probably.
[20:42.54]What?
[20:42.82]What about... That's... I can do eight of clubs, right?
[20:46.70]Wouldn't that follow logic, I think?
[20:48.34]I can't do eight of clubs on your seven of... No, that's not a club.
[20:50.73]That's a... That's a... Whatever the hell that is.
[20:52.55]Can I do king of clubs?
[20:53.11]Oh, wait.
[20:53.37]That's a... That's a spade.
[20:56.63]Sorry.
[20:56.95]Seven of spades.
[20:57.73]Shh.
[20:57.91]I'm gonna die.
[21:00.67]What about any hearts?
[21:01.33]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21:02.69]Is this uno?
[21:03.75]What about the tea of hearts?
[21:04.65]Fuck.
[21:09.41]Yeah, this is how my family plays, you know.
[21:12.65]What about the T of hearts?
[21:15.02]Where does that stand?
[21:15.88]Uh, well, we're gonna go with king.
[21:19.34]I don't think you can do anything about this.
[21:21.06]King of hearts.
[21:22.36]It's uno and war mixed together.
[21:23.88]What happens if I play, like, an eight of hearts?
[21:25.88]Can't.
[21:26.04]You can't go down.
[21:27.35]What if I match a different suit?
[21:29.05]Can't.
[21:29.87]Nope.
[21:31.93]What about T?
[21:33.17]Nope.
[21:34.15]Sorry.
[21:35.19]I can't use my bonuses.
[21:36.57]Sorry, your heart's gonna get ripped out.
[21:41.89]Maybe you can only use a bonus, like, once a game?
[21:43.57]I don't know.
[21:44.35]I don't think I've even used one.
[21:45.54]Alright, you're about to get, like, a... You're about to get a cleaver on your neck.
[21:50.64]Oh, T is 10.
[21:51.60]I'm okay.
[21:59.71]I'm okay.
[22:00.49]I don't even know what that was.
[22:03.67]Okay.
[22:05.51]You just got punched in the face, like, seven times.
[22:10.05]What is that?
[22:10.55]Is that like a toothbrush?
[22:11.55]Yeah.
[22:13.37]I'm gonna stick a toilet bowl cleaner in your mouth.
[22:16.14]Okay, I think I have something I can... No, that's going down.
[22:20.00]Oh my god.
[22:21.08]I'm gonna lose here.
[22:22.46]King?
[22:24.32]What about like a different pile?
[22:27.66]What about tea?
[22:32.67]I don't think I have nothing I can do here.
[22:36.69]No, that's nine, eight.
[22:38.97]I can't go down.
[22:40.05]Well, I'm dead.
[22:43.05]How many more times can I get hit in the head with a hammer before I'm dead?
[22:46.12]I still have the card in my hand.
[22:47.64]You still got 13 health.
[22:49.14]You're hanging on.
[22:50.10]You're doing okay.
[22:51.90]Okay.
[22:54.88]What should I do here?
[22:55.94]How about... Oh, man.
[22:58.18]I kind of just don't want you to play a card here because I want him to rip your heart out of your chest.
[23:04.16]I can't even put it down.
[23:05.04]Where did this just go?
[23:05.88]It's, like, face up, but on your side of the table.
[23:08.20]What is going on?
[23:10.77]You gonna, like, five-finger death punch me?
[23:12.83]I... I can't even use it.
[23:17.51]Uh... Can you do anything?
[23:20.35]Why do they even put a spotlight if you can't, like, put cards out on the table?
[23:25.00]I think we may... I think the game may have broken here.
[23:28.42]Oh, I'm not... I can't say that I'm... Yes, it is.
[23:30.78]I've tried every card.
[23:33.04]You've tried to do every...
[23:37.18]That was it?
[23:38.08]That was it.
[23:38.68]You just get punched in the chest.
[23:40.16]Okay.
[23:41.12]Hey, I can pick this up now.
[23:42.58]You can.
[23:42.94]What did you just do?
[23:44.10]You just switched decks.
[23:44.92]Thanks.
[23:46.22]Nice.
[23:47.14]I'm going to put bugs in your nose.
[23:50.86]What is that?
[23:52.97]How come you can play all your bonuses?
[23:56.59]That's not fair.
[23:57.19]You can play the emoji movie and I can't?
[23:59.91]It said I could steal one of your bonuses, but I don't seem to have one.
[24:04.13]Okay.
[24:04.27]Okay.
[24:06.74]I feel like that's going to kill me.
[24:07.78]That's a nine of diamonds?
[24:12.14]Okay.
[24:14.42]Take care of this.
[24:17.96]What is this even going to do?
[24:18.84]Does he stab you in the chest with arrows?
[24:22.77]Uh... It looks like a cat of nine tails flail or something like that.
[24:28.65]We're about to find out.
[24:33.57]Yeah, I can't pick up any of my cards, so...
[24:36.70]Bring it on.
[24:37.92]Get him.
[24:39.52]No, it's just your turn.
[24:40.84]Why?
[24:41.02]I don't know.
[24:42.98]Because we didn't read the rules.
[24:44.60]Yeah, we didn't read the rules.
[24:48.08]Rise of the... Okay, we're going to play the Terminator card.
[24:50.68]Rise of the Machines.
[24:52.06]What the fuck does that mean?
[24:53.87]Rise of the Machines.
[24:57.29]All right.
[24:57.63]How about this?
[25:00.11]Can you do anything?
[25:03.21]I heal.
[25:03.79]I tried to heal before.
[25:04.77]It didn't work.
[25:08.18]I'm not allowed to play a single card.
[25:09.62]That's just Terminator Guy Fieri.
[25:12.83]Why do they even turn the spotlight on if you can't play a card?
[25:17.63]Yeah, well get ready to fucking go to Flavortown!
[25:20.49]Alright, what's he gonna do?
[25:26.20]He just stabbed you in the stomach, alright.
[25:27.70]Yeah.
[25:28.36]I'm not gonna be able to eat for a few days, but other than that I'm okay.
[25:31.84]13, 13, we both have 13s.
[25:34.54]Deal with tea.
[25:37.39]I don't even know what T stands for.
[25:38.89]T stands for 10.
[25:39.73]Good luck.
[25:41.01]I can't, like, wait, can I, like, split this?
[25:43.61]This isn't blackjack.
[25:44.67]How can I split this?
[25:46.35]I can't.
[25:49.18]I can't do it.
[25:51.90]Uh, I don't have any hearts.
[25:53.28]The only heart I actually, yeah, I do.
[25:55.44]I have this one.
[25:56.98]Oh, please, come on.
[25:57.98]T of hearts.
[25:58.90]I can't put the king of hearts on here.
[26:04.61]Are we just so blatantly missing the rules here?
[26:14.31]You're dead.
[26:17.51]Can't say I'm particularly satisfied with the manner in which you died.
[26:20.45]Hold on.
[26:20.79]Hold on a second.
[26:24.68]There are 36 cards.
[26:25.42]I'm going back to the rules.
[26:26.38]There are 36 standard cards.
[26:30.86]You have 30 seconds on every turn.
[26:33.80]When you pick up a card, it will be blocked for one turn.
[26:36.64]Okay.
[26:36.94]Whatever that means.
[26:37.60]A joker does six damage.
[26:42.47]So that's just free damage.
[26:44.11]Players act in turn no matter if they pick up the card or dodge.
[26:48.79]Transfer avoid damage from the ace.
[26:51.82]I mean, you know, here's the problem here.
[26:54.30]This is not telling us the rules.
[26:55.86]This is telling us like bullet points of things that can possibly happen in the game.
[27:00.32]This is like if you played this game in real life, this is how you would play it in the video game.
[27:05.04]Like it assumes you already know how to play the game.
[27:07.41]This is just the interpretation.
[27:09.05]This assumes that you already know how to play this game.
[27:12.61]When you pick up a card, it will be blocked for one turn.
[27:14.47]If you play it with a Joker, it deals 6 damage.
[27:17.39]Press the space button.
[27:19.99]Okay, I guess we can just read these.
[27:21.69]Okay, plus 20, plus 20 is HP.
[27:24.08]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:24.70]You transfer attack.
[27:25.64]These are bonuses.
[27:29.02]What about the actual cards down here?
[27:32.18]It seems that they do a proportional amount of hit points.
[27:35.52]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[27:36.92]T is A's, by the way.
[27:39.64]Trump.
[27:40.04]We're doing this totally wrong.
[27:40.84]Probably T for Trump.
[27:43.18]We're doing this totally wrong.
[27:44.30]These are just percentages.
[27:46.38]I don't think the suits matter at all.
[27:47.84]All right, T is apparently the strongest thing in the game.
[27:52.91]Yeah.
[27:54.27]That's what I was just saying.
[27:55.03]It's like Ace.
[27:55.85]T for Trump.
[27:56.59]Trump card.
[27:57.69]Oh, okay.
[27:58.95]But Joker beats anything.
[28:02.47]So that's actually the Trump card.
[28:03.97]So I don't know.
[28:05.15]So Joker sits in between.
[28:07.29]The Joker is not J. Where is the actual Joker?
[28:10.13]I think it just says Joker on it.
[28:11.39]It's at the top of the list.
[28:15.08]All right, let's do this one more time and then never play this game again.
[28:21.46]This is the important part.
[28:22.70]Give me the important part.
[28:24.82]To avoid damage from the ace, which is the T card, you can beat it with the sixth of matching suit.
[28:32.46]So if you have a six that matches it, you can avoid the ace damage.
[28:35.62]Okay.
[28:37.06]So six is like counter aces.
[28:40.27]Oh, okay.
[28:42.87]And Joker also does.
[28:49.71]Use mouse three to shoot the other guy.
[28:52.47]What?
[28:54.87]Are you in a game?
[28:57.07]I will be in a second.
[28:57.87]All right, make that game.
[28:58.63]Let's get it going.
[28:59.73]Let's do it, baby.
[29:03.89]There's one part I want to find out.
[29:08.02]So T stands for, like, you lose.
[29:10.90]It's ace.
[29:14.06]Yeah, but you can counter it with a six or a joker, which I think is considered dodging.
[29:17.96]Oh, God, my internet's dying.
[29:20.31]no what why is my internet dying welcome to comcast ladies and gentlemen we just started what the what my internet is actually down to like a thousand k up that's what what is going on right now this is so stupid uh well let's hope this passes I am in a lobby
[29:48.22]to actually try to play this game for real.
[29:50.58]Dude, I'm getting as close to 0k up as I can possibly.
[29:53.77]I've dropped 10,000 frames.
[29:59.29]It's almost as high as chat can count.
[30:04.79]Okay, I think we're evening out here.
[30:06.87]We passed, we threw the storm.
[30:09.21]We might be.
[30:10.81]Okay, lobby list.
[30:11.73]I might have to restart the game.
[30:14.18]Yeah, I have to exit the game to find a new lobby.
[30:18.16]Wait, you're not in my lobby?
[30:19.34]Is this someone else?
[30:20.22]You're playing against somebody else right now.
[30:21.86]Oh, interesting.
[30:23.46]Yeah, I am currently playing against an unknown person.
[30:27.55]Well, abandon that.
[30:28.35]Give that guy the free win.
[30:30.11]Just go into the game of Hearthstone and I concede.
[30:33.55]Boom!
[30:34.21]And you get to go up a rank.
[30:35.29]That guy's going to be so happy about that.
[30:36.43]Alright, you out?
[30:40.99]Yeah, I am out.
[30:42.59]Make another one.
[30:44.72]That's not you.
[30:46.32]Alright, will do.
[30:46.95]This guy's currently scrimming right now.
[30:53.13]It's the only other person playing this game, I'm pretty sure.
[30:56.57]Hey, look!
[30:57.35]Oh god, finally, a game!
[30:58.57]I can play a game!
[30:59.35]I'm in a game.
[31:01.01]Go ahead and try.
[31:01.77]I'm coming.
[31:03.23]Come on.
[31:04.81]It's gonna be so funny though, since there's no name tags.
[31:08.31]Like, if there were four people playing this game, like, we could be in other people's games and think that we're playing against each other, but we're not.
[31:17.71]I can't even join your fucking game.
[31:19.87]Is somebody in that game?
[31:23.09]No, my game's empty right now.
[31:24.75]Oh, my God.
[31:26.51]Just join me through friends list.
[31:29.92]Hold on.
[31:30.40]Let me... No, it's my client.
[31:33.42]Hold on a second.
[31:35.04]It's my guy.
[31:35.46]I got a client on the phone.
[31:36.30]Oh, your client?
[31:38.38]Tell them to reschedule.
[31:40.68]Hopefully nobody else is playing this video game right now.
[31:44.63]I think someone else is in the game again.
[31:47.73]God damn it.
[31:50.91]Hey, you ready to go play Lost Castle?
[31:54.76]That sounds like fun tonight.
[31:56.38]We can do this one more time.
[31:59.14]You start the lobby and I'll join off you.
[32:01.20]Do I have to do anything special?
[32:04.80]You literally just push play.
[32:05.96]Alright, I'm in a game.
[32:10.87]What does this guy have, like, tattoos?
[32:14.95]Uh, that is a sword fight between a bunny rabbit and a dinosaur.
[32:19.66]He has, like, somebody's name on his arm.
[32:23.10]He's got the, uh, he's got the Infinity War guy, Thanos' hands.
[32:28.00]Alright.
[32:28.32]Joker.
[32:29.22]Is this me?
[32:29.58]Is that you?
[32:30.04]Is this you?
[32:30.81]Look up and, yeah, okay, that, that... I gotta, look, I don't know if that's you or not.
[32:36.09]What do you mean?
[32:36.57]How am I supposed to determine if that is you?
[32:38.63]It's just a guy shaking his head.
[32:40.63]It's me.
[32:40.83]Okay, I'm ready.
[32:42.16]It's me.
[32:42.94]All right, you ready?
[32:43.54]Okay, so let's play this game.
[32:45.04]I'm ready, and who gets to go first?
[32:46.84]You do.
[32:48.66]I do.
[32:51.88]That is the eight.
[32:53.23]That is the eight of spades.
[32:55.67]Eight of spades.
[32:56.67]Eight of spades.
[32:57.17]Also known as needle drill in your shoulder.
[33:00.90]He's getting ready.
[33:01.58]He's got a gun.
[33:02.76]Why is he holding a gun?
[33:04.74]He has a gun.
[33:05.84]I don't think I can do anything here.
[33:10.80]No, I can't.
[33:11.96]So basically, since you played a higher card, I think, you dodged my attack.
[33:16.93]So now you're attacking me.
[33:18.33]Now I am attacking you.
[33:19.37]So the number is a percentage of my health.
[33:22.25]I get you.
[33:22.69]Okay.
[33:22.99]So what is this one?
[33:25.03]It looks like a rose or something.
[33:26.53]Try to dodge that one, buddy.
[33:29.74]So, Queen of Hearts.
[33:32.86]That's like the third highest damaging card, I think.
[33:35.34]What if I try playing... Do I want to dodge that?
[33:41.92]I don't know.
[33:43.09]So, if you play a higher... I thought you couldn't play anything unless it was the same suit.
[33:49.15]I don't know.
[33:52.33]I think he's... He just dropped something.
[33:55.35]Did he like... Did he just throw like a... Wait a minute!
[34:03.33]Okay.
[34:04.75]I thought he was pointing that at me.
[34:09.08]I might be bleeding.
[34:10.26]I'm in need of some triage right now.
[34:12.86]Where did I get shot?
[34:14.24]That only did 25% damage to you.
[34:16.50]Only 20?
[34:16.84]That's so much.
[34:18.24]He shot you in the head.
[34:19.59]All right, so that's 25% damage, right?
[34:24.41]I guess, if that's how much your queen did.
[34:26.55]So I'm going to have to... Let's see.
[34:28.59]That's of hearts.
[34:29.71]No, that's diamonds.
[34:36.22]I don't think I can do anything about this.
[34:41.38]No.
[34:42.72]I can't do anything about this, so I'm going to skip the turn.
[34:47.66]He shot me, too.
[34:48.58]I wasn't even looking.
[34:49.60]He shot me.
[34:50.54]We both got shot with a gun.
[34:52.36]You got shot in the stomach, though.
[34:54.90]That only did 15 damage to you.
[34:56.70]No, I just skipped my turn.
[34:57.98]My thumb was on... My thumb was on Spade's part.
[35:01.16]Hey, thanks, man.
[35:03.69]Have another queen.
[35:04.73]Oh my god.
[35:05.53]My thumb is sitting on spacebar and I just fat fingered it.
[35:09.09]That's fine.
[35:10.39]You're gonna get swordmaned.
[35:12.71]No, I'm not.
[35:13.07]You're just dodging.
[35:16.68]Anything you play right now doesn't actually hurt me.
[35:19.20]It just cancels the card that I have.
[35:20.44]Why does that look like it's trying to go on top?
[35:24.24]Ah, shit.
[35:28.02]He's waiting.
[35:31.01]And he's going... I don't know.
[35:32.17]He's got roses.
[35:34.16]I can't... This is just a game where he has the gun.
[35:43.81]Okay.
[35:46.01]And you still only have five less HP.
[35:49.31]Let's bring back Terminator Fieri.
[35:51.87]Hold on.
[35:54.62]I got shot and did five damage.
[35:56.06]Why does he only have a gun this time?
[35:59.97]Though I cannot play my ace trump hearts over your king.
[36:05.82]Apparently not.
[36:07.12]What if... What if I did this?
[36:10.88]Nope.
[36:12.94]Do you have any bonuses?
[36:13.90]You could mess me up with a bonus right now if you really wanted to.
[36:17.08]The bonus literally goes off the screen.
[36:19.52]Oh.
[36:19.76]Like, the bonus text is...
[36:23.53]That kills anybody.
[36:24.33]Like, you've been shot.
[36:25.67]I've been shot.
[36:26.13]You've been stabbed.
[36:27.93]Your turn.
[36:28.55]I think I'm going to win this one.
[36:29.60]We're in face armor.
[36:32.90]It's early access.
[36:36.12]T?
[36:36.50]Oh, come on.
[36:37.08]You're going to play a T right now?
[36:38.50]I am going to play a T. That's going to do, like, a ton of damage.
[36:42.11]I have nothing I can do about that.
[36:43.23]But I can do this.
[36:43.81]Get out of here.
[36:51.43]What is that, like hit the hitchhiking card?
[36:53.07]That's like the get out of here card.
[36:57.05]Hold on, what did I just get?
[36:58.66]Oh, speaking of get out, I thought that was a T. I was about to play this and be really mad.
[37:03.22]I thought that was a T. That's just the Great British Pound.
[37:08.52]Let's go with... I don't think you're going to be able to excuse me this one.
[37:22.98]Is that a mouse trap over here?
[37:26.46]T. I love someone who just wrote in the chat, this game is weird.
[37:32.08]Oh, it's mine.
[37:37.28]Sorry.
[37:37.54]Oh, you're not paying attention?
[37:41.78]What are you doing?
[37:44.86]I don't think I have anything.
[37:45.96]Get him again.
[37:47.42]He's at 35%.
[37:48.90]He's done for.
[37:55.10]All right.
[37:55.88]All right.
[37:56.86]This game sucks.
[37:59.69]Don't say that yet.
[38:00.53]We've only seen the entire game what the whole game has to offer.
[38:04.13]We have to, like, give it another few minutes.
[38:08.87]Terminator King.
[38:10.87]This game is weird.
[38:12.12]I don't think I can do anything about that, so I'm going to go ahead and say thank you for playing that card.
[38:17.36]I'll take the damage.
[38:22.08]What's the finisher?
[38:23.06]So I get shot, you get shot.
[38:25.20]I get stabbed, you get stabbed.
[38:26.88]Can you be a little more original, please, next time?
[38:29.42]Thanks.
[38:29.94]Somebody just gave $100 for this.
[38:33.78]For this game.
[38:34.86]And this moment.
[38:36.19]Yeah, if this game's like $6, you could buy like 20 copies of this game.
[38:39.41]I could buy like 25 copies of this game.
[38:42.29]It's actually 20.
[38:42.99]I did the math.
[38:43.85]Oh, you just did the math.
[38:44.67]Nice.
[38:45.51]Quick.
[38:46.15]Quick.
[38:47.19]How about Crying Wednesday Addams?
[38:51.63]Not Wednesday Adams.
[38:53.13]The Wendy's girl.
[38:53.77]Why did I say Wednesday?
[38:57.39]The Wendy's girl, not Wednesday Adams.
[39:02.38]I'm going to check that in just a minute.
[39:04.72]Oh my god, it was more than that.
[39:06.02]What the fuck?
[39:09.30]Oh my god, somebody gave a lot of money.
[39:12.19]I just played a bonus, and I'm not sure.
[39:15.17]Quick math.
[39:16.35]What did you get for the bonus?
[39:17.51]I...
[39:19.72]Why'd you lose?
[39:21.27]Why are you getting stabbed?
[39:23.95]I'm still holding the card.
[39:26.35]Why are you still... Alright, I'm gonna finish you off, because somebody just gave, like, a monumental amount of money, and I can't even look at it.
[39:33.09]What is that?
[39:33.83]A 10?
[39:34.49]That's a 10 times 3.
[39:36.55]10 times 3 of... That's 30, so do you have a 30 in your hand?
[39:40.98]No, but why can I not do this?
[39:42.32]I can't trump card that out?
[39:44.60]I don't understand how this game is supposed to work.
[39:48.66]Um...
[39:50.88]I can't do anything about this.
[39:52.40]I want to see if this does 10 times 3 damage to you.
[39:54.68]Let's see if he's gonna... 1, 2, 3.
[39:57.10]How much damage did it do?
[39:58.90]Only did 10.
[40:00.20]Okay, well, I'm gonna finish you off right here.
[40:03.42]Okay.
[40:03.84]How do I want to finish you?
[40:04.66]Let's see.
[40:05.72]Make it interesting.
[40:06.42]Alright, I'm gonna make it really interesting.
[40:07.70]Let's see, we got... I think I want to, like, tear you apart.
[40:11.42]Yeah.
[40:11.96]I'm gonna put, like, thorns all over you.
[40:14.92]You're in so much trouble.
[40:21.64]Oh no, my internet's dying again.
[40:25.62]No internet, no internet, come on!
[40:27.76]Uh oh, look what I did!
[40:29.98]I wanna see what the person said!
[40:33.61]Don't end the stream!
[40:34.63]You have to play a card!
[40:37.99]I can't do anything, just trump me!
[40:41.81]I think I dodged.
[40:46.15]You're in big trouble!
[40:48.99]Oh god, am I gonna lose?
[40:51.24]This card literally says Hitler on it.
[40:53.64]Oh, that's great.
[40:56.58]I can't read the rest of it, but I'm pretty sure that it says Hitler.
[40:59.71]I'm gonna die.
[41:04.17]I'm at 20 HP.
[41:04.75]Is my internet holding up?
[41:08.87]This is where I gotta... I gotta beat you right here.
[41:12.75]We've got... There we go.
[41:16.19]No, it's your turn.
[41:16.85]Did you pass?
[41:19.38]Com class.
[41:20.26]Com class quality of insurance.
[41:23.08]Oh, come on.
[41:23.87]I'm gonna lose.
[41:24.79]You just won.
[41:25.19]You're gonna lose.
[41:25.99]No, no, no.
[41:26.53]Wait, wait, wait.
[41:27.97]Oh, my fucking god.
[41:28.99]I lose.
[41:29.83]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[41:31.95]I can't do that either.
[41:33.31]No, you won.
[41:33.87]I lose again.
[41:36.37]Yeah, just kill me.
[41:37.39]It's over.
[41:38.37]What are you gonna do to me?
[41:41.69]Hit you with a bat approximately five, six, seven, seven times.
[41:46.31]Get the fuck out of here.
[41:47.63]My internet's dying.
[41:50.75]That was fun.
[41:52.15]Yeah.
[41:52.75]I bet we could play this game for like an hour, hour and a half.
[41:55.09]Well, it's been 40 minutes.
[41:57.07]Stuff would have lost castle.
[41:57.93]That's what I was told earlier today.
[42:00.50]Hour and a half.
[42:01.18]All right.
[42:01.84]Hold on.
[42:02.08]I got some.
[42:03.80]Get lost castle ready to go and meet back here in five minutes.
[42:07.54]All right.
[42:09.88]Anyways, we're gonna move to Lost Castle.
[42:12.74]This is like a side-scrolling rogue-like RPG kind of beat-em-up that seems like it could be fun with more than one person.
[42:20.30]That was Lynch.
[42:22.70]Okay.
[42:25.14]That was a game.
[42:26.07]Let me just set this up.
[42:35.87]What am I gonna even change the title to?
[42:37.69]How about
[42:40.54]castle smashers castle smashers that's awful but I don't even whatever um but anyways amco the terrible amco the terrible gave 250 dollars
[43:01.29]That is insane.
[43:04.72]250 bucks in the message.
[43:06.28]So hopefully the stream is not like dot.
[43:08.60]Thank God I muted that because that was a shock into my ear.
[43:12.40]I'm so glad I muted that before that came up.
[43:14.97]Oh my Lord.
[43:15.53]Hold on.
[43:15.99]Just hold on.
[43:23.51]Every single video game.
[43:24.75]All right.
[43:24.95]Turn the vibe.
[43:25.38]I got to plug my, um, that's fine.
[43:28.00]Okay.
[43:30.05]Anyways, thank you so much, dude.
[43:31.81]Amco, thank you.
[43:32.55]You say, hey German, just wanted to say thanks for everything you do.
[43:37.25]The steady stream of content helps occupy my time.
[43:40.34]It helps.
[43:40.74]It really helps.
[43:42.12]I'm a depressed disabled veteran struggling to really find my place in life and find any kind of inner peace.
[43:49.76]And so it's nice to be able to catch your streams and watch your past broadcasts.
[43:52.90]Thanks.
[43:53.50]Also, the game sucks.
[43:56.89]Thank you so much, dude.
[44:01.79]I feel horrible to hear that you're a disabled veteran.
[44:06.17]But first of all, thank you so much for serving the country.
[44:10.68]That's an incredible service.
[44:14.80]And second of all, I'm so, so humbled that somebody would ever say something like that about me.
[44:29.07]And my streams and my content.
[44:32.19]I wish you the best, man.
[44:43.00]That's a lot of money to give me, though.
[44:45.12]Thank you.
[44:49.21]But let's... Let me try to get this to open.
[44:53.83]Hopefully my stream is like...
[44:58.36]What if they serve a different country?
[45:00.58]Whatever country you have given your service to.
[45:03.58]Thank you.
[45:08.38]And my stream is like severely struggling right now.
[45:12.40]I've dropped 20,000 frames.
[45:18.59]I don't know what's going on with my internet, but it does not want to work tonight for some reason.
[45:23.63]Let me just plug my controller and hopefully this passes.
[45:25.55]Otherwise, we're going to have to make it a real early stream because it's just not going to work.
[45:30.43]It's going to turn off.
[45:32.42]And I'm really sorry about that because obviously me and Italics are going to play some games tonight.
[45:36.98]That's unfortunate.
[45:39.94]Let me just get my controller plugged in.
[45:42.72]Give me a second.
[45:46.89]Is this correct?
[45:51.01]Yeah, it is.
[46:00.29]Where are you?
[46:01.59]Come on.
[46:02.89]I need you.
[46:03.51]I need you right now.
[46:06.93]There.
[46:11.90]Fuck.
[46:12.22]Come on.
[46:12.48]I'm like, I'm trying to waste so much time so this can pass.
[46:16.68]God damn it.
[46:23.53]Net neutrality.
[46:25.61]Yeah.
[46:26.07]Oh, hey.
[46:27.53]Open up my internet.
[46:30.11]Quit throttling me off.
[46:33.88]Let's move this to... This is not... I'm going to have to tell Tal because this might be a... This might be a detonate the stream stream.
[46:49.74]Because I am at like 600k.
[46:54.75]All right, so if you want to watch, like, a stream, like, go to Italics' stream because, like, this one is at 500k.
[47:01.63]Jesus.
[47:03.71]It's going to change the game capture.
[47:08.30]Maybe it'll pass.
[47:08.96]I'm hoping it'll pass here in a minute.
[47:14.34]Stream times two, and it goes away within, like, 15, 20 minutes.
[47:17.54]Well, let's get started then.
[47:18.96]Which is still a long time.
[47:22.50]All right, so I need to turn on my gamepad control.
[47:29.84]Well, this is not correct.
[47:32.30]Oh, I'm at zero.
[47:38.61]We have actually detonated at zero.
[47:40.41]I think the stream is off.
[47:42.77]No, we're back.
[47:49.04]Oh my God.
[47:51.38]I hope my stream wasn't turned on for that.
[47:56.71]Do you have a controller plugged in?
[47:59.67]No.
[48:01.79]Should I?
[48:02.15]I would assume.
[48:04.85]Oh my God.
[48:05.24]I got to like clean this off.
[48:09.18]Damn it, man.
[48:10.58]What?
[48:11.40]Do I need to mute?
[48:12.34]No, no, no.
[48:13.30]My stream is... What are you doing?
[48:15.02]I can't... I'm going to... All right.
[48:17.42]Just look at the display.
[48:19.70]Okay.
[48:20.08]This is so stupid.
[48:22.69]Internet.
[48:23.07]Like, I turned my goddamn stream on, and, like, my internet's just like, you know what?
[48:26.79]Today is the day.
[48:27.55]I don't even care anymore.
[48:32.05]Big wow.
[48:33.93]All right.
[48:35.41]Multiplayer.
[48:38.55]Uh, online multiplayer.
[48:41.39]How do I, like, join your video game?
[48:43.24]Connecting to server.
[48:46.34]Like, seriously, when you came back and were like, oh, I hope my stream wasn't live for that.
[48:50.37]I was like, uh...
[48:53.00]Are you nude right now?
[48:56.04]Did you have a wardrobe malfunction?
[48:58.42]The camera came back on and I'm just naked in a bathrobe.
[49:01.72]Oh, I do have a bathrobe.
[49:02.80]I hope my stream wasn't live for that just now.
[49:04.96]I have a bathrobe story for you.
[49:07.08]Can you make the game?
[49:08.18]Because my internet can't handle hosting.
[49:10.08]I'm actually in the game.
[49:11.36]What is it called?
[49:11.76]I can invite friends.
[49:12.90]Is it called?
[49:13.22]It's called, you can guess, but it's called playing a real game.
[49:17.26]I don't see that.
[49:18.47]That's the name of the room name.
[49:19.97]You might have to actually be on friends list to join.
[49:23.95]All right, let me see.
[49:25.77]Because I made it private.
[49:27.53]Oh, that's probably why.
[49:31.46]Can you go ahead and do me a favor and invite me to that game?
[49:35.52]Did you get the invite?
[49:42.72]I did just get the invite.
[49:43.96]Let's see if we can rock and roll.
[49:48.69]Am I in?
[49:52.15]Hey, there we are.
[49:53.11]Hey.
[49:54.72]I have a controller plugged in, and it's not doing anything.
[49:56.84]Yeah, me either, so we have to play mouse and keyboard.
[49:59.31]All right, change appearance.
[50:00.29]Let's change our appearance.
[50:04.37]All right, this one, I guess.
[50:07.05]No, you can't be green as well.
[50:08.75]I know, that's why I'm changing.
[50:10.17]Steam noise.
[50:14.48]I like this one.
[50:17.26]All right, that's fine.
[50:17.98]Are we ready?
[50:18.76]I guess we're ready.
[50:21.08]You look pretty kawaii.
[50:23.93]Don't ever say that again.
[50:26.54]New save file.
[50:27.62]I want to play.
[50:29.44]Don't delete my saves.
[50:30.48]Hey, you have control of this.
[50:32.02]Why are you controlling mine?
[50:33.78]Which one of us is player one and which is player two?
[50:36.48]I was the one that invited you.
[50:38.22]Oh.
[50:39.54]So how are you controlling the game?
[50:40.86]I don't know, but this is going to be fun.
[50:45.44]My stream is dead.
[50:46.66]My stream can't even function.
[50:50.26]Why?
[50:52.95]We're gonna go to zero, guys.
[50:54.07]It's just a matter of time.
[50:55.87]Is that him that just did that?
[50:58.17]Oh my god, that's so funny!
[51:05.69]I'm so angry right now.
[51:07.21]Isn't this just the Castle Crashers intro?
[51:10.21]It kind of is.
[51:10.81]I don't even... I'm so mad that I can't even... I'm screaming at like two frames a second.
[51:20.51]I think that's the last boss.
[51:25.55]I bet the wizard is in on it the whole time.
[51:28.29]No, he's not.
[51:29.39]This game actually is supposed to be very fun and, uh... Alright, well... You opened up a portal to hell.
[51:41.58]58 frames a minute.
[51:42.36]58 frames a minute?
[51:44.34]98, 89 frames a minute.
[51:48.13]Only power with EVGA's newest GTX 1080 Ti.
[51:53.35]58 frames per minute.
[51:55.87]Yeah, by the way, the stream, I'm telling you right now, guys, the stream is going to collapse.
[52:01.75]So when it does, thank you so much for watching.
[52:06.09]See you next time, but we're going to ride it out as long as we can.
[52:11.43]Happy New Year from Comcast.
[52:13.39]We disabled your internet.
[52:15.35]It must be like a...
[52:17.50]Regional thing, because I have Comcast as well.
[52:21.83]Yeah.
[52:22.23]I've only dropped 250 frames.
[52:23.11]All right, so E is pick up.
[52:25.63]How come you have a gun?
[52:27.39]I do have a gun.
[52:28.21]What are we picking up?
[52:29.99]You have a bow and arrow.
[52:31.81]Okay, you can sprint.
[52:33.57]Can I pick you up?
[52:34.77]Treasure hunter.
[52:35.37]I don't think so.
[52:37.31]Spaces jump, obviously.
[52:38.53]Okay.
[52:43.74]Let's go.
[52:47.42]There's a lot of buttons.
[52:48.90]Why is K attacked?
[52:50.98]Wait a minute.
[52:51.66]Why would K be attacked?
[52:55.22]L is... Dude, I have to put both my hands on the keyboard.
[52:58.58]Why can't I just use a controller?
[53:00.01]No mouses.
[53:01.75]We're playing a PC game from like 1998.
[53:07.59]It's all on the keyboard.
[53:09.03]Oh, Jesus.
[53:09.83]You... I'm playing...
[53:15.90]I'm getting a controller.
[53:17.16]Do you have an Xbox controller?
[53:18.42]Yeah, I already plugged it in.
[53:20.28]It doesn't work.
[53:20.82]Your Xbox controller don't work?
[53:22.60]Hang on.
[53:22.92]I'm going to try again.
[53:23.76]Do you have an Xbox One controller?
[53:26.71]Yeah, it's Xbox One.
[53:28.33]It's plugged in right now.
[53:29.59]And it's not working.
[53:30.71]Hold on.
[53:31.01]I'm going to escape.
[53:32.93]How do you go to menu?
[53:33.85]Uh-oh.
[53:36.29]Uh-oh.
[53:36.95]Uh-oh.
[53:38.09]What are you talking about?
[53:39.61]Exit all video games.
[53:41.15]What have you done?
[53:42.23]There, I'm back.
[53:44.30]I like changed all my scenes.
[53:46.89]There.
[53:47.49]Gamepad controls.
[53:50.47]Hold on.
[53:52.27]That's super attack.
[53:53.11]How many?
[53:53.69]Actually, I think it's working now.
[53:54.83]It is?
[53:55.35]How'd you do it?
[53:56.97]I literally like changed every scene on OBS.
[53:59.37]Okay, you changed every scene on OBS.
[54:01.41]I hit like escape, up, down, left, right, and then I tabbed back out and back in and it worked out.
[54:07.22]What do you mean?
[54:09.74]What are you talking about?
[54:11.44]How did you do this?
[54:13.30]I just told you how I did it.
[54:14.70]I'll tab in.
[54:16.32]Press the button.
[54:16.80]Unplug it.
[54:17.86]Plug it in.
[54:18.80]Yeah, I unplugged it, plugged it back in, tabbed, switched all the scenes, and now it works.
[54:23.29]Now it works.
[54:24.43]Mine doesn't work.
[54:28.87]You have an Xbox controller?
[54:29.71]I don't know.
[54:31.61]What?
[54:32.67]Entertain them for a minute.
[54:33.59]I'm going to get my Xbox controller.
[54:35.57]What are you trying to play with?
[54:36.61]PS4?
[54:39.86]Careful.
[54:41.10]This is not an IRL stream.
[54:42.30]You gotta save those jokes for when the camera's turned on.
[54:45.80]Where's my Xbox controller?
[54:47.67]You can't do those just microphone jokes.
[54:49.33]You gotta have the webcam turned on for that one.
[54:51.33]Wait a minute.
[54:53.85]What's in here?
[54:58.79]Desperate times call for desperate measures.
[55:03.09]We're plugging in a Steam controller.
[55:05.86]Are you ready for this?
[55:07.08]Why don't you play with Steam Link, too?
[55:12.68]I'm plugging in the Steam controller right now.
[55:14.46]Uh-oh.
[55:15.34]Did it work?
[55:21.47]Ladies and gentlemen, that's... Why nobody plays PlayStation anymore?
[55:25.89]My computer crashed.
[55:29.35]Did it really?
[55:37.48]Well, you know...
[55:40.48]Wait, wait, wait.
[55:41.10]Hold on.
[55:41.56]I'm going to try to get it back.
[55:42.36]Good thing this is a co-op stream.
[55:47.90]Oh, this is a disaster.
[55:49.84]How are you still talking to me if your computer crashed, though?
[55:53.16]The game is locked.
[55:54.58]No, it's not.
[55:54.96]Hold on.
[55:59.84]Oh, you fucking stupid thing.
[56:01.44]I hate computers.
[56:03.10]What do we even need computers for, seriously?
[56:06.90]No, there we go.
[56:07.30]Hold on.
[56:07.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[56:08.10]I had to...
[56:09.07]I want everybody to know that Jerma picked all the games today.
[56:13.03]I have no hand in this.
[56:13.87]I'm good.
[56:14.11]I'm good.
[56:14.33]I'm good.
[56:15.55]All right.
[56:15.95]So how the hell does this work?
[56:20.27]B picks up items.
[56:21.43]Okay.
[56:22.33]B for me is jump.
[56:26.73]Good luck.
[56:30.07]Oh, God.
[56:30.81]These are all wrong.
[56:34.27]I can walk around, but I can't attack.
[56:36.03]Yeah, try using the triggers.
[56:38.79]No, the trigger, like, exited the game last time.
[56:41.26]Hold on.
[56:43.50]My attack, like, sucks, by the way.
[56:46.80]This character, like, sucks.
[56:48.20]I think I can do it individually.
[56:50.24]I can.
[56:51.50]Okay, so let's go attack.
[56:54.50]Special action.
[56:56.40]Jump.
[56:58.58]Pick up interact.
[57:00.18]Is this doing anything?
[57:01.55]No, you're just standing still on my screen.
[57:03.45]No, no, I'm talking about just in general.
[57:05.00]Discard item.
[57:08.16]Use item.
[57:11.34]Use skill.
[57:12.54]Did that fucking do anything?
[57:18.60]You're still just standing there.
[57:23.09]Unless you're talking to yourself.
[57:24.49]There you go.
[57:24.95]Now you're moving.
[57:26.13]Now you're jumping.
[57:26.97]And you can't attack.
[57:30.06]Don't you have an Xbox One controller?
[57:32.36]Yeah, but it's like dead.
[57:33.67]Okay, I can pick up items.
[57:35.13]I just can't attach.
[57:35.93]Plug it in.
[57:36.97]I don't even know where it is.
[57:40.19]My fucking stream is like at zero K up.
[57:43.65]How come every time we stream together, it's like it is the technical support.
[57:47.63]Because God hates me.
[57:50.38]That's why.
[57:51.66]Every single time.
[57:56.73]my stream works I've only dropped a hundred more frames since we've been talking what is your special attack uh it's this I can't even do anything I can use the keyboard it's pow right in the kisser hold on I'm gonna give one more thing here oh yeah what a joke I'm going back to menu because I am not I'm not playing this game with this character
[58:27.87]I'm like listening into the echo chamber.
[58:34.32]Alright.
[58:37.38]I'm just going to play with the keyboard because it's going to take me like 15 minutes to go find this controller.
[58:41.46]I am actually really fucking mad right now.
[58:44.17]I'm undeniably upset.
[58:47.17]Where are you?
[58:47.65]Let's go.
[58:48.95]Let's go play this fucking game.
[58:51.44]I backed out.
[58:52.46]What do you mean you backed out?
[58:54.35]I want to pick a new character because my character sucks.
[58:56.11]What do you mean your character sucks?
[58:58.29]He's just a shotgun that goes pow.
[58:59.89]It literally just says pow whenever I do the attack button.
[59:02.53]Why can't I leave the game?
[59:06.07]I can't leave the game.
[59:07.85]Oh, wow.
[59:09.95]Just match made on accident.
[59:12.66]There actually was a server called Next a minute ago, which is pretty dedicated.
[59:18.28]I'm not going to lie.
[59:21.32]That is a dedicated jokester.
[59:27.60]I can't.
[59:29.05]By the way, I actually cannot exit the game.
[59:31.93]I can't even open up my task manager.
[59:34.03]I'm sorry.
[59:35.27]This is not even fucking funny.
[59:37.27]I am so upset right now.
[59:40.42]Oh, God.
[59:40.92]I'm going to rage off stream tonight.
[59:48.04]Where even is it?
[59:49.54]I might as well just, like, turn on the fucking webcam and be in a bathrobe.
[59:52.00]That's, like, what I'm in right now.
[59:53.02]And I had a bathrobe story for you.
[59:58.44]Hey, we're doing great at 4K up on my stream.
[60:01.04]That's fan-fucking-tastic.
[60:04.24]4K up?
[60:04.47]That's enough for 480p?
[60:05.53]I mean, like, 4 kilobytes up.
[60:08.13]Oh.
[60:10.17]That's enough for 56K?
[60:10.73]No?
[60:10.79]4K?
[60:10.87]4K.
[60:10.91]High definition.
[60:16.99]Why is this not even listed here?
[60:18.13]Oh, my God.
[60:21.31]All right, which one of these is the prettiest characters?
[60:24.99]Chat.
[60:26.01]Oh, I think I passed it.
[60:27.21]Maybe this one.
[60:30.61]Why can't shit just work, man?
[60:31.96]Like, why can't it just fucking work?
[60:33.36]Let me try this again.
[60:36.06]One last time, and then I'm going to play with the keyboard, and then I'm going to, like, cry myself to sleep because I think the stream is actually down.
[60:45.47]Alright, can we pass?
[60:46.95]100,000 frames dropped, I wonder.
[60:50.49]I don't think chat can even count that high.
[60:52.75]Oh no, don't start that.
[60:53.79]Don't do that.
[60:55.03]Come on.
[60:55.63]I'm like, I'm struggling here.
[60:57.54]And you're trying to get people to do fucking counting memes?
[61:01.26]I'm struggling.
[61:04.98]It just has to, any time.
[61:06.86]This is the second time you brought it up.
[61:12.13]You've brought up the counting shit.
[61:14.55]Oh my lord.
[61:15.27]Alright, here we go.
[61:17.83]Say your prayers.
[61:18.71]Here they go.
[61:24.85]We can try.
[61:27.29]I just got shot in the head by a gun.
[61:29.75]Oh my head.
[61:31.37]Nah, this is it.
[61:35.43]I gotta use the keyboard.
[61:37.83]Sometimes you deal with it.
[61:38.81]One of those times to deal with it.
[61:50.20]There we go.
[61:50.76]Definitely this one.
[61:58.01]Ruins his own chat.
[62:03.05]Masochist.
[62:03.97]Invite me to the game.
[62:04.85]I'm going to play MLB MVP 2K4 on the PC with both my hands on the keyboard.
[62:11.96]I almost invited stealth.
[62:13.42]That would be pretty funny.
[62:16.19]Where are you?
[62:17.09]You're not even appearing where I can see you.
[62:20.16]How am I not online?
[62:23.04]There we go.
[62:24.08]Oh, look.
[62:24.44]Somebody's inviting me to a video game.
[62:25.90]Can't wait to play it.
[62:27.40]Can't wait to play it.
[62:28.08]Keyboard and mouse.
[62:28.80]All you gotta do is I-J-K-L.
[62:31.93]Unbelievable.
[62:32.63]I'm so sorry, everybody.
[62:33.65]This game looks like it could be fun, too.
[62:38.55]My PS4 controller works for every single video game except for this one.
[62:45.37]I'm going to go with the guy with the beard.
[62:48.27]Tell Jerma all his old viewers are in your chat now.
[62:53.52]They can actually watch the stream.
[62:54.92]All his old viewers.
[62:56.64]They're not yours anymore.
[62:58.14]I'm ready.
[62:59.40]You've got to pick somebody way cuter than that.
[63:02.22]That guy is just kind of crusty.
[63:04.50]Look, we don't got time.
[63:06.02]We don't got time for this.
[63:06.74]He's got a scar on his cheek.
[63:07.92]He's battle-hardened.
[63:09.15]You've got to have somebody that has a little bit of a sunny disposition in the squad.
[63:12.33]A little bit of hope, ray of sunshine.
[63:13.35]Fine, this guy.
[63:14.81]Oh, yeah, he's definitely, like, main character potential.
[63:17.23]Yeah, he's main character potential.
[63:21.11]Yeah, just overwrite all the saves.
[63:23.02]I forgot that we have to watch the intro.
[63:24.84]No, just skip it.
[63:25.98]You can skip it, right?
[63:27.22]How?
[63:27.38]I don't know.
[63:28.08]Press enter.
[63:28.62]Press escape.
[63:29.58]Press start.
[63:32.48]I had to pick a different character.
[63:33.72]The other one was miserable.
[63:34.94]Oh.
[63:41.13]Well, to like the 400 people that left the stream, I'm sorry that it was this bad.
[63:47.95]You know the over-under, like 10% of every stream I do has to be like a technical disaster.
[63:52.44]That's like how it works.
[63:55.50]If I stream 100 times, 10 of them are gonna be like Steam Controller crashes your desktop.
[63:59.99]Like, this is how it works.
[64:01.99]Watch out for the stag beetle.
[64:06.00]Was that like old kids TV show with like the Beatles but they were Power Rangers, but they were like in beetle costumes.
[64:12.92]Yeah What's the name of that show This is still better than the Family Guy stream do I have like anything download in the background or something like what is going on here I
[64:27.66]No, the family got streamed way better than this.
[64:28.92]Beetleborgs!
[64:30.04]No, I was just reading a comment.
[64:31.26]I didn't agree with it.
[64:32.06]I just thought it was funny.
[64:33.38]Big Bad Beetleborgs!
[64:35.48]I love that show.
[64:36.06]Big Bad Beetleborgs?
[64:37.32]Yeah, they were Beetleborgs.
[64:39.30]The show was great.
[64:41.66]Oh, God.
[64:44.38]All right, tell me the story.
[64:46.29]Oh, okay.
[64:46.77]All right, anyways.
[64:48.19]So, I woke up this morning and I had a bathrobe on.
[64:51.89]Uh-huh.
[64:52.19]And, you know...
[64:54.00]No, I'm just not feeling it.
[64:55.28]I'm going to have to get a little bit happier before I tell the story.
[65:01.04]I would love to tell you that story.
[65:01.84]I have to get happier.
[65:02.98]I have to get a little happier.
[65:03.76]All right, this is way better.
[65:06.19]I have a bow again.
[65:08.71]So let's just go.
[65:10.27]I mean, let's be real, though.
[65:11.73]If you were going to stereotype that character, that's the bow character.
[65:15.45]I mean, it kind of is.
[65:16.39]So let's do keyboard, mouse.
[65:18.51]No, not keyboard.
[65:19.09]Okay.
[65:20.76]K is attack.
[65:22.05]J is special.
[65:22.81]And L is use skill.
[65:25.39]So I have that.
[65:26.02]That's like a skill.
[65:26.76]So your skill is on a charge.
[65:32.97]I don't think they like that I'm playing this game.
[65:34.65]Alright, Apple.
[65:35.65]It gives you 10 HP.
[65:36.87]You can pick up coins.
[65:40.86]E is just... I guess you just pick it up.
[65:43.48]Okay, U is select item.
[65:46.06]O is select item.
[65:47.20]I is use item.
[65:48.44]Oh my lord.
[65:49.04]I'm like learning how to type again.
[65:51.64]Alright, there's our first chest.
[65:54.96]Wow, look at that.
[65:55.54]A huge golden chest which only will appear after heroic achievements.
[66:03.07]Hey, leave some for me.
[66:04.25]Oh, wait, I forgot it's like Diablo 2.
[66:05.47]Alright, show status, previous page, next page.
[66:10.48]Okay, dagger.
[66:11.90]Oh, like the RB... Yeah, I get it, I get it.
[66:15.74]It's like an item.
[66:17.38]Oops, now it's gone.
[66:18.45]That looks good so far, okay.
[66:23.41]R is discard.
[66:25.25]My hand, I'm gonna get arthritis from playing this.
[66:28.95]You gotta have the claw grip to play with the keyboard.
[66:33.08]Into the game already.
[66:33.89]We're supposed to dodge that.
[66:35.11]Have we passed the threshold where my stream works?
[66:38.27]I don't know.
[66:38.73]I think so.
[66:45.37]Wait, it's loading a cutscene.
[66:47.37]Why are we separated?
[66:50.40]We gotta meet up again.
[66:51.88]Do we actually have to meet up again?
[66:56.62]I can hear you.
[66:58.08]Come out of your cells.
[67:00.97]Where are you?
[67:01.45]Are you attacking me?
[67:03.25]Oh no, you're already out of health.
[67:04.97]You know, you are so loud.
[67:08.05]That is just like too much.
[67:09.54]It's too much.
[67:14.34]Press auto combo.
[67:18.00]Okay.
[67:23.61]I am the blacksmith.
[67:24.51]Damn it.
[67:25.75]I'm holding out hope that I can still use this fucking thing.
[67:28.64]Alright.
[67:31.10]Stream's good.
[67:31.96]Good.
[67:32.74]It actually is watchable.
[67:33.64]Alright, let's talk to this sack boy.
[67:37.36]Alright, talk.
[67:38.64]How do you talk?
[67:41.69]Are you talking to this guy?
[67:43.23]Yeah, he just said, are you sure you want to open the cage?
[67:45.61]It's dangerous.
[67:46.49]And I was like, yeah, I want to play this video game.
[67:50.23]Watch out.
[67:50.65]Dodge the arrows.
[67:52.53]Easier said than done.
[67:55.65]Yeah, it's easier said than done.
[67:57.47]I'm playing the piano right now.
[68:00.83]Listen, Dodge, I'm already like halfway dead.
[68:03.01]Are you dead?
[68:03.91]I'm getting my ass hurt.
[68:08.51]Wow, look at that multi-shot arrow.
[68:10.19]Wow.
[68:13.71]Why is that happening?
[68:17.51]Hold on.
[68:17.83]How do you use it?
[68:18.62]There you go.
[68:19.20]I just threw a banana.
[68:20.24]What am I accidentally doing?
[68:25.97]Do I have auto... Listen, let me just handle this, and then you just keep, like, tagging along in the back.
[68:38.34]Get hit by falling chests.
[68:41.70]I'll just continue to be totally useless.
[68:45.56]Fine, I'll take your thing.
[68:49.04]Alright, I am now the, like, barbarian.
[68:52.47]This actually looks like it could be pretty fun.
[68:55.43]If I didn't have to play Beethoven's fucking Sonata.
[69:03.11]I'm gonna get hit by everything.
[69:05.09]Is this like Link's Journey to the Past where you can get stuff out of containers?
[69:08.81]I'm gonna die, so... There's a lot of enemies in here, to be fair.
[69:16.63]I'm dead.
[69:19.34]I have 18 health.
[69:23.73]So when you described it as binding of Isaac, I wasn't really sure what you meant.
[69:27.99]But apparently what you meant is you die in the tutorial.
[69:32.17]I think so.
[69:36.79]That's what you meant.
[69:37.39]I don't want to play the piano.
[69:38.95]The whole game's over.
[69:39.98]I don't want to play the piano.
[69:44.34]So we actually get scored, and there's not like a respawn at checkpoint.
[69:49.81]You just go back into the cell.
[69:51.67]We were supposed to die.
[69:54.85]There were like 30 goblins.
[70:00.40]This is a you're supposed to die sequence.
[70:01.94]Yes, this is a you're supposed to play the you're dead sequence.
[70:05.86]So it's Dark Souls.
[70:07.14]Sure.
[70:09.34]Oh, boy.
[70:13.75]I'm the Lord of Souls in death.
[70:17.37]All right, hold on.
[70:18.53]Wait, wait, wait.
[70:19.97]Talix, just buy some time.
[70:22.17]What?
[70:23.39]Listen, there's actually a countdown timer.
[70:25.23]Look over those and talk about them.
[70:27.17]There is a 40-second countdown timer on sacrifice right now.
[70:33.23]35.
[70:34.87]I got to put points into something.
[70:38.15]I don't know.
[70:38.45]Which cell do you guys want to open?
[70:39.60]The first, the second, or the third?
[70:42.08]Meanwhile, in the aquarium... Meanwhile, in Jerma's aquarium...
[70:47.59]Look, I'm just gonna mute him for a second.
[70:50.57]Pick which one.
[70:52.93]You guys have 15 seconds.
[70:57.42]12 seconds, I'm just gonna put them all in, whichever one.
[71:00.36]There's no fourth.
[71:02.04]All right, I see third the most.
[71:05.70]What did you do?
[71:07.79]I just unlocked the key to the third cell and it gave us... Are you picking?
[71:15.11]I think you're picking now.
[71:17.65]Yes!
[71:17.83]All right, I got it.
[71:19.61]We're good.
[71:20.29]I pick now?
[71:21.07]What do I have for points?
[71:22.29]I don't know.
[71:22.61]I put it in the third one.
[71:24.19]You put it in this one, the key to the third cell?
[71:25.73]Yeah.
[71:25.83]All right, I'm going to put it into the key to the first cell.
[71:29.32]All right, looks like you have... Open the first cell in the Goblin Tower.
[71:34.80]One of those knives that you spin around your finger.
[71:36.92]I guess.
[71:37.56]In, like, the raid.
[71:38.38]Sacrifice?
[71:39.26]Sacrifice?
[71:41.33]Yeah, you sacrifice the demon soul.
[71:44.75]No relation to Dark Souls, just the demon soul.
[71:47.21]You can only do it.
[71:48.74]You can only do it, and then you have to get rid of all the points.
[71:52.52]All right, now I'm ready to have fun.
[71:55.14]I actually... Did you hook up a controller?
[71:57.16]I sprinted out of the room and got my controller.
[71:59.79]Let's do it again.
[72:00.49]All right, this is fun.
[72:01.86]This is fun.
[72:02.50]I like it.
[72:02.96]Here we go.
[72:03.28]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stream.
[72:04.96]Welcome to the fun stream.
[72:07.02]I hope you enjoy yourself at the fun stream.
[72:09.25]I'm a mage now.
[72:10.03]Today, me too.
[72:10.63]You're a mage now.
[72:11.87]I think it's just random.
[72:14.98]You sure?
[72:15.50]Jump.
[72:17.77]This is cool.
[72:19.67]And I think my internet's ready to go.
[72:23.48]Here, come over here.
[72:24.64]Let's do some practice because we don't want to die in the first room.
[72:27.38]That's what this room is for.
[72:28.58]So, right trigger is... Right trigger is your skill move.
[72:36.17]Okay.
[72:37.93]And Y is like a poof.
[72:42.06]Oh, I can get this iron bow.
[72:43.58]No, I don't want the bow.
[72:45.24]Let's be mages.
[72:45.76]Let's try to get this.
[72:46.40]Let's try to actually.
[72:47.14]Nice PowerPoint stream.
[72:49.64]Oh, so this is what happened.
[72:50.56]I unlocked.
[72:51.72]You unlocked the first one.
[72:52.78]I think you unlocked the blacksmith and I unlocked the third cell, which is this person.
[72:58.27]Thank you for releasing me.
[73:00.21]I think they give us potions.
[73:01.21]Yeah, she just gave us a free potion.
[73:05.92]This is probably a good weapon.
[73:08.76]Not even Comcast.
[73:09.96]I'm running on the same node.
[73:14.06]They probably haven't updated the Comcast neighborhood node in like 19 years.
[73:21.36]Before even broadband existed.
[73:28.35]Nothing I can do about it.
[73:28.97]I'm sorry, guys.
[73:31.37]I'm trying to ride it out.
[73:32.39]Stream's still on.
[73:34.76]God.
[73:38.90]And then it's not ready.
[73:42.22]They take a dot.
[73:43.24]They take a dot.
[73:43.96]That's cool.
[73:44.26]They take a dot?
[73:44.96]They take a dot.
[73:45.62]Concentrating.
[73:46.14]Oh, so maybe you have to just dodge go through them?
[73:48.96]They might.
[73:52.25]How come sometimes your basic attack shoots like three?
[73:54.81]Maybe it's a random chance?
[73:55.85]Yeah, I think it's just a random chance.
[73:58.57]Get something else cool.
[74:00.98]It does take a long time to kill them with the bow.
[74:05.46]With the staff.
[74:06.56]I mean, yeah.
[74:09.53]Is this from Armor Games?
[74:11.11]This guy's like an elite.
[74:12.95]Is that what he is?
[74:13.59]Oh, because he has the Plants vs. Zombies construction worker thing on his head.
[74:17.65]That's how you can tell.
[74:20.34]I steal money.
[74:26.47]Start screaming and don't just show a series of images.
[74:29.81]And they seem to be destroyed yet.
[74:38.04]So I see we don't... There's like a combo you can do too.
[74:42.40]It's not just like if you hit X three times in a row the right way.
[74:45.62]You can do like combos.
[74:47.08]Shit, that hurt.
[74:58.61]Actually, it's not just three times in a row.
[75:07.83]You can kind of just spam it.
[75:09.77]It's all about spam.
[75:14.17]I want the bomb.
[75:15.05]That gun sucks.
[75:15.95]Does it suck?
[75:16.39]Are you sure?
[75:16.85]It's just really boring.
[75:18.73]Is it boring?
[75:19.97]I don't know.
[75:20.75]That's what my main character started with.
[75:23.53]Okay.
[75:23.95]I don't know what just happened.
[75:24.99]Did that hurt you?
[75:25.63]I just hurt myself.
[75:27.22]I did the special move and it hurt me.
[75:28.48]Alright, let's go.
[75:31.92]Are you ready to tell the story yet?
[75:33.87]Oh, okay, so I'm feeling a little bit better.
[75:36.37]I need... Alright, this is intense.
[75:44.35]Yeah, I mean, it's as weird as it probably looks on the screen.
[75:47.63]It's like a high concentration game.
[75:50.45]We're basically playing Cuphead.
[75:52.60]I need to be very, very happy with my current situation before I tell the story.
[75:58.74]Okay, why is that doing that?
[76:01.33]That does like 25 damage, by the way.
[76:05.27]Plus two attack.
[76:11.16]I do like how it says that they're actually dead if they're lying on the ground like that.
[76:14.50]Rather than not dead.
[76:15.58]Ooh, what's that thing?
[76:17.06]Source of poison.
[76:18.68]You are poison.
[76:19.56]There's poison running through your veins.
[76:21.75]You resist poison.
[76:22.79]You want that?
[76:24.93]Uh, sure.
[76:26.44]Yeah, you take that.
[76:27.16]I got the plus two attack.
[76:28.16]You take that one.
[76:33.04]Up here?
[76:33.62]Can we go up there?
[76:34.64]No.
[76:35.68]Hey, go pick up the banana peel so you can throw it.
[76:37.46]Ha!
[76:37.78]Gotcha!
[76:38.40]Got him!
[76:39.88]Not right now, man.
[76:41.74]I am not in the mood for this.
[76:44.12]I'm very, like, angerable right now.
[76:46.04]I'm very upset right now.
[76:47.76]I actually don't know where to go.
[76:49.12]I think it's, like, random.
[76:50.00]Maybe we have to go back.
[76:50.72]Yeah, we have to go back, I think.
[76:54.78]Nope, we don't.
[76:56.48]Did we miss something?
[76:58.60]What is happening in my chat right now, actually?
[77:00.52]What is happening in your chat?
[77:01.68]I don't know what's happening.
[77:03.10]Oh, you told people to count, and now they're counting in your stream.
[77:07.12]Hey, it's yours now.
[77:08.84]You can own it now.
[77:09.48]I don't know what's happening.
[77:10.97]I think we have to leave this way.
[77:13.33]It looks like we could go that way.
[77:14.33]I think one of my mods just accidentally banned some people.
[77:18.53]Can we not go up here?
[77:20.47]We weren't supposed to be banned.
[77:21.91]Hey, come stand up here.
[77:24.78]I'm standing next to you.
[77:25.68]I was standing next to you.
[77:26.78]There's nothing up here.
[77:28.18]We have to go this way, then.
[77:32.88]Where are you going?
[77:33.72]Come over here.
[77:36.32]I'm trying to solve problems.
[77:37.82]All right.
[77:41.94]For today and today only.
[77:43.72]For today and every day afterwards, every single meme is allowed in chat.
[77:49.22]Oh, wow.
[77:49.76]Did you hear that, guys?
[77:53.05]with no bans or restrictions.
[77:54.91]Only those which Nightbot imposes.
[77:57.03]You're allowed to make any joke you want in his stream.
[78:02.55]All of them are allowed.
[78:04.40]Wait, did you say all memes, by the way?
[78:06.44]Yeah, all of them.
[78:07.94]I'm going to die.
[78:09.00]I'm dead here.
[78:09.54]Yeah, me too.
[78:10.44]I have 26 health.
[78:11.06]I have an unknown potion I'm about to use.
[78:15.58]The bomb sucked.
[78:16.64]The guy's throwing the grenades.
[78:17.72]We need to get out of here.
[78:19.84]Is this an anime?
[78:20.62]I just got like, I do not aim with my eye.
[78:23.23]I aim with my heart.
[78:24.61]Unlimited blade works.
[78:25.85]I don't want to use that move anymore.
[78:30.43]I wish that text would stop taking up the entire screen.
[78:36.28]Come on, we got to get everything we can.
[78:45.61]Not doing too bad.
[78:50.08]Okay, I killed a couple.
[78:52.56]God, we do have a lot of points.
[78:55.90]I just walked right into that shit.
[78:57.24]Come on.
[78:57.70]Really?
[78:58.32]I'm gonna get health after this.
[79:01.82]Watch out.
[79:02.10]Watch out for the bomb.
[79:06.26]Okay, it's fine.
[79:07.39]It's fine.
[79:08.73]Oh, but I need health, though.
[79:14.21]We got small magic scabbard fire.
[79:16.51]A magical scabbard drenched with fire.
[79:18.33]Daggers are enchanted with fire.
[79:19.27]You get the attack up.
[79:20.79]There's so many items.
[79:22.37]There's so many.
[79:24.19]You can drop items, though, by the way.
[79:26.07]You take the attack up because I already have two of them.
[79:28.86]I don't know.
[79:29.54]Do I want to be close range or do I want to still be range fire staff guy?
[79:33.74]That's up to you.
[79:36.14]Short sword.
[79:37.04]Attack plus 8%.
[79:38.46]Skill hurl.
[79:39.84]Skill just throw up.
[79:41.70]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[79:42.96]Well, I'm about to take this if you don't.
[79:45.09]What?
[79:45.57]Topaz?
[79:46.05]Go ahead.
[79:47.03]Okay.
[79:47.69]Do you need health?
[79:48.51]Do you need health items?
[79:49.49]I do need health.
[79:50.77]If you could give it to me.
[79:52.12]It's a right thumb stick to drop an item.
[79:54.64]You got it.
[79:55.94]First boss.
[80:01.40]Now that we can actually play this game, I actually think it's fairly fun.
[80:06.85]At least initially here.
[80:07.67]Yes.
[80:09.41]It's mostly fun because we've got to see what the next item we're going to get is.
[80:13.98]And we have to see what you can do in the skill tree.
[80:16.08]That's all I care about is the skill tree.
[80:25.68]There's so many memes right now.
[80:27.94]I am the bone of my jaw, steel is my body, and fire is my blood.
[80:32.53]I have created a thousand blades, unknown to death.
[80:35.21]I died.
[80:36.99]Hey, let's watch Italics' stream through my stream, but it's of lower quality.
[80:41.81]That sounds fun.
[80:47.38]So how do I bring you back?
[80:49.00]Where are you?
[80:49.38]I don't think you can.
[80:49.96]Yeah, I think I can.
[80:51.10]Let me try and kill these guys, and then I'll get to you.
[80:56.24]Maybe I... Oh, yeah, I do come back.
[80:57.66]You have to time it.
[80:59.20]You have to play Golf Sword.
[81:04.45]That takes a long time.
[81:07.33]That's a very long time.
[81:08.37]Okay, you... Yeah, there we go.
[81:11.21]That's better.
[81:13.37]Okay.
[81:13.97]Okay.
[81:16.13]Ooh, look at all this.
[81:17.41]Bananas and chicken.
[81:20.13]Jumpstick does like 30 or 40 health.
[81:23.30]Yeah, I needed it.
[81:24.86]I needed it more than you.
[81:27.04]No, I have a much lower health pool than you.
[81:29.79]You have more health than I have max health.
[81:31.83]Well, it don't matter.
[81:33.21]It's okay, though, because I'm not... There you go.
[81:35.83]First boss is Yoshi.
[81:36.77]First boss.
[81:40.67]That's Yoshi's half-frog stepbrother.
[81:43.80]Didn't you say today was the last day for memes anyway?
[81:49.86]Essentially, yeah.
[81:51.28]So, there you go.
[81:52.08]This is the meme funeral.
[81:55.07]Alright, we gotta kill the first one.
[81:55.85]Everybody's giving their last wish.
[82:00.55]Reading the will.
[82:01.29]Let's see what the patterns are.
[82:03.73]Oh!
[82:03.91]Okay, he sprints, then he gets tired.
[82:05.17]He has a lot of health.
[82:06.59]How are you supposed to dodge that?
[82:08.16]Jump over it.
[82:08.66]Why is he just chasing me only?
[82:12.10]Oh, he has a tail whip.
[82:12.84]We're good.
[82:15.78]He's hungry.
[82:16.22]I don't know what that means.
[82:20.12]His eyes are up.
[82:27.01]Just like Dark Souls, man.
[82:27.93]One hit, don't get greedy.
[82:29.47]I'm getting greedy.
[82:31.05]One, two, get out.
[82:33.77]You also have range, don't forget.
[82:36.15]One, two, get out.
[82:38.80]I have to like... Oh my god, I have a million years.
[82:45.00]He's going to do A. Careful.
[82:46.86]I don't know what he's doing.
[82:47.72]He's trying to eat me.
[82:52.53]No.
[82:52.69]Oh, God.
[82:52.91]How do you revive?
[82:53.55]How do you do it?
[82:54.37]You have to, like, stand next to me for, like, 30 seconds.
[82:56.29]So wait until he charges left.
[82:57.07]I just have to stand next to you.
[82:58.67]And press B when you get up to me.
[83:02.41]Nice, like, back hop.
[83:03.44]I just imagine you doing cartwheels.
[83:05.08]All right.
[83:05.32]When he gets to the middle, hit B. He just, like, belly flopped on me.
[83:10.04]I got to hit him.
[83:13.28]Nice dodging.
[83:18.52]He's got to go all the way over here.
[83:22.18]There's no other faster way to do this?
[83:24.36]Nope.
[83:30.07]All in.
[83:31.21]Got it.
[83:32.85]Instantly.
[83:34.13]Get out of the way.
[83:35.31]You can make it.
[83:36.25]There's an apple over here.
[83:38.29]Hey, apples to apples.
[83:39.22]You know what I'm saying?
[83:44.91]Where'd you get those?
[83:45.85]I don't have any of those.
[83:47.07]It's my special ability.
[83:48.29]It's like my skill.
[83:49.53]I have a special ability that hurts me, so I'm like afraid to use it.
[83:53.08]Having a melee against this guy is like impossible.
[83:55.32]What are you even supposed to do?
[83:56.18]That's a good question.
[83:59.84]Wait till he falls.
[84:02.10]Just dodge, dodge, dodge, and wait till he falls.
[84:06.89]He's gonna come after us again.
[84:08.17]Watch out for it.
[84:08.75]Dodge it.
[84:14.59]You can handle it.
[84:15.79]Give me the green!
[84:16.87]You can handle it.
[84:19.12]I just got all that.
[84:20.58]You did.
[84:20.94]You did pretty much everything.
[84:23.54]Oh my god, I got a lot of those.
[84:24.58]No, you got it too.
[84:28.20]This is not the ideal build for this guy.
[84:30.67]It does not seem ideal.
[84:31.55]Alright, what are we getting here?
[84:35.65]Lots of stuff.
[84:36.59]That's a lot of things.
[84:37.61]Okay, let's separate this.
[84:39.45]Let's be very, very... All right, you get first pick of the litter.
[84:42.27]What do you want?
[84:42.81]First pick of the litter.
[84:44.27]You mean, like, is there shit and cat pee in here?
[84:45.89]What are you talking about?
[84:46.77]Yeah, like, which cat do you want?
[84:47.85]And the rest of them we're going to have to leave out in the cult.
[84:51.44]I want the Mithril Sword.
[84:53.44]The Mithril?
[84:54.88]Yeah.
[84:56.68]Mithril Sword.
[84:59.66]Okay, a weird spell book may or may not be bound in human skin.
[85:03.24]Unknown potion.
[85:04.41]I'll take that.
[85:05.51]So what does this do?
[85:06.51]I actually have a block.
[85:07.41]That's great.
[85:09.21]Okay, what's my special move?
[85:11.49]It'll be poison dagger boy.
[85:13.15]I can give myself like an overheal essentially, just like a shield.
[85:15.51]All right, I'm now the poison rogue.
[85:19.86]And I am sword and board overheal guy.
[85:23.84]And I also have a forbidden book made out of skin.
[85:26.90]Alright, stream's going so, stream's alright now.
[85:28.83]We're having fun here.
[85:30.80]It only took us an hour and ten minutes to get there, you know, but sometimes you have to deal with it.
[85:36.21]You know, like, I have to, like, just calm down.
[85:37.83]Hey, you gotta start somewhere.
[85:38.83]Hey, dude, so this morning.
[85:39.41]Wow.
[85:39.49]What happened this morning?
[85:41.31]Funnily enough, so I had a robe on this morning.
[85:43.37]I like to wear a bathrobe.
[85:45.03]I'm, like, a bathrobe kind of guy.
[85:46.41]Like, you know, if I... I'm a nude person, so I like to not put on, like, clothes when I'm just hanging around the house.
[85:52.22]Anyways, so this is a very, very big robe, and it has huge swooping arm holes.
[85:57.90]You know what I'm talking about?
[85:58.66]No!
[85:59.87]It is not like a tiny little robe.
[86:02.71]This is like a World of Warcraft robe.
[86:06.15]There's a lot of stuff happening.
[86:07.77]We'll touch back up.
[86:10.16]There's a lot of stuff happening right now.
[86:20.44]There's so many people.
[86:24.28]There are way too many people on this screen.
[86:25.90]There really are.
[86:28.83]Okay, I've got it.
[86:29.51]It's being handled right now.
[86:33.19]Okay, it doesn't block all damage.
[86:35.39]Oh, man.
[86:36.05]Jesus.
[86:37.23]Woohoo!
[86:44.65]What did I just do?
[86:45.39]I created a little fairy.
[86:48.16]Where am I dead again?
[86:49.16]Oh, you died again.
[86:50.90]Shut up.
[86:52.00]I got you.
[86:54.18]I got you.
[86:56.10]No, I don't.
[86:56.50]Not yet.
[86:57.70]Don't you dare meme me.
[86:59.36]Hey, you're the one that called for this.
[87:01.16]That's not going to happen.
[87:01.84]I got to kill everybody here.
[87:07.01]Sorry.
[87:07.63]Oh boy.
[87:09.51]I have meme power, too, over you.
[87:12.01]You do have... I swear to God, man, I keep seeing this stupid walrus.
[87:16.73]What is it?
[87:18.79]I believe there was a pig, a spider, some ghost oozes.
[87:25.90]Plus two crit, sure.
[87:36.03]Anyways, funny story.
[87:38.29]Anyways, really funny story.
[87:40.50]Can't wait to hear how it is.
[87:41.72]My robe has really huge swooping arms that obviously go all the way down.
[87:46.14]It's a long sleeve robe.
[87:48.85]So I was filling up a glass of water.
[87:50.85]I grabbed a glass of water and I was really thirsty and I didn't want to take a shower today.
[87:55.99]So I'm filling up a glass of water from the sink.
[88:00.79]There's another story there.
[88:01.99]I was drinking sink water.
[88:03.07]Two stories in one.
[88:03.81]Wow, what a deal.
[88:04.41]I was drinking sink water.
[88:06.28]There's a story there, but there's another story on a different day.
[88:09.34]Anyways, I'm filling up this big glass of water and I went a little too far.
[88:13.54]And instead of it going into the glass, my, like, wizard robe hand went up, and I was holding the sink up at full blast, and it was going down, like, the arm tube, all the way down, and just, like, soaking me.
[88:26.11]And I, like, I didn't even know for, like, a full, like, three or four seconds.
[88:28.99]So I poured, like, a bucket of water on myself, like, inside of my body.
[88:32.99]And I didn't even know I was doing it.
[88:33.99]I was, like, I was looking at the, I was, like, I had my phone in my left hand, just holding the faucet up, just thinking I was in the cup, and it wasn't.
[88:39.32]It was in my, it was my robe.
[88:42.86]So how did you not know you were pouring water on yourself?
[88:45.20]Because it wasn't touching me.
[88:46.26]It was just on the robe.
[88:47.62]I have large, very large swooping robe arms.
[88:50.43]So it was going down like the chute for like three seconds and finally like soaked up and went all the way into me and like I had to change.
[88:56.47]So you made like a robe water slide in your arm.
[88:58.43]I made a robe water slide, yeah.
[89:00.35]Okay.
[89:01.69]Funny story.
[89:02.75]That was pretty funny.
[89:03.67]Then you found out and then you had to like change clothes.
[89:05.95]You didn't want to take a shower, but it looks like you took a sink shower.
[89:08.65]Yeah, I know.
[89:09.51]Like, jeez.
[89:11.81]I said that too.
[89:13.09]I took the robe off and I opened up the door.
[89:15.70]I opened up my front door and I was like, oh, Jesus!
[89:18.04]Wait, no, I would have been naked.
[89:21.66]No, I didn't do that.
[89:22.20]I didn't open up the door.
[89:24.47]What is this thing?
[89:25.67]It looks like armor.
[89:27.81]Looks like a suit of banditi armor.
[89:30.61]Do we have a two-handed... I keep dying, so I probably... Yeah, you get that.
[89:34.44]If you have a two-hander or a musket, you get more stuff.
[89:38.62]I don't think these count as two-handed, though.
[89:40.14]Somebody's calling me a liar.
[89:41.56]Maybe they do.
[89:41.92]It's not a lie.
[89:44.53]Yeah, I don't see attack plus five.
[89:45.69]All right, so just put it on.
[89:49.05]Potion with unknown effects.
[89:50.05]Let's just take it.
[89:51.35]Not right now.
[89:51.93]Bomb.
[89:53.31]All right, let's keep going.
[89:57.70]Whoops, I just used the book of skin flesh on accident.
[90:01.30]No, I don't want that.
[90:02.04]Can I keep going this way?
[90:04.08]Hopefully I didn't need it for anything.
[90:06.55]Flyer, right.
[90:10.59]You know, I can't do it right now because I actually am naked, like under this rope, and my webcam's not plugged in.
[90:18.20]One day I'll show you this rope, and you're going to be like, wow, actually that makes sense.
[90:21.68]I would have done something like that too if I had a sink.
[90:30.90]I'm taking all the health by the way.
[90:34.35]I'm not sure you're seeing this, but I am.
[90:36.39]Hold on.
[90:40.00]What?
[90:40.30]Whoa!
[90:40.82]I'm inside the cocoon.
[90:46.36]What are you doing?
[90:49.93]Yeah, you're getting... How did you do that?
[90:54.15]Did you write that?
[90:55.25]There's like a communicate with your teammate button.
[91:00.03]I'm just getting so many unnecessary hits right now.
[91:03.33]Stupid piranha plants.
[91:09.80]We have a lot of piranha.
[91:11.20]I have a feeling we're going to get into a situation where we're not going to win.
[91:15.21]That is the point of this game, I think.
[91:16.57]I just got minus one defense.
[91:18.35]That's odd.
[91:22.88]Piranha plants.
[91:23.62]Guys, it's like Super Mario Brothers.
[91:26.74]The piranha plants.
[91:30.86]Don't be next to them when they explode, because they do damage.
[91:33.78]You know this food that you wanted?
[91:35.17]I'm going to take some, but I'm going to eat it.
[91:36.61]Stop throwing bombs.
[91:38.43]I tried to eat the fruit.
[91:39.53]Careful, careful.
[91:41.01]I want to spend these points.
[91:45.31]it was a mario reference I hate germo why wow this looks like a mini boss so uh how do I get this off my screen don't be stupid why is that we're about to both be dead I can't what I I'm doing piano controls not right why why did it just give up on me
[92:14.29]Focus on one at a time.
[92:20.09]How are you still alive?
[92:23.81]He's dead.
[92:24.17]He's dead.
[92:24.55]That guy's definitely dead.
[92:28.94]Careful.
[92:30.14]And spam.
[92:31.74]Are you blocking?
[92:32.42]Is that how you're not taking any damage?
[92:33.94]No, you still get hurt if you block.
[92:39.20]Does the spider spawn out of those?
[92:40.72]Oh, there's another one.
[92:42.04]Oh, those are mines.
[92:46.76]Can this, does this stack?
[92:48.41]It does, okay.
[92:50.55]Oh God, I can't jump over that shit.
[92:51.69]Careful.
[92:53.77]I can't jump over that stuff.
[92:58.03]Okay, taken care of.
[92:59.61]All right, we, so far so good.
[93:04.01]We're like on the cusp of losing again.
[93:06.15]Why did I call sleeves arm tubes?
[93:09.82]All right, you get two, and I get two.
[93:11.42]All right.
[93:13.34]That sounds pretty... We better use them.
[93:14.98]That sounds diplomatic.
[93:15.92]You get two, I get two.
[93:17.39]Yeah, instead of you take all the food again, we're just going to keep going.
[93:24.57]I would give this game a solid...
[93:28.88]Are we rating it already?
[93:30.64]Yeah, you have to rate the game after 40 minutes inside of it.
[93:33.84]It has to be as you go.
[93:35.94]All these reviewers, all these people, all these journalists, they quote journalists.
[93:39.97]They wait till they play the entire game and then they sit down and they take a bath and they're like, did I like that?
[93:45.55]No, you dynamically rate the game.
[93:47.03]So the first two hours of the game, you rate it.
[93:49.98]Middle four hours, you rate it.
[93:51.66]Final three hours, rate it.
[93:52.74]Then you hit the median rating.
[93:54.86]And that's how you end up with how the game actually was.
[94:00.83]I have one hit.
[94:03.17]You have what looks like one hit.
[94:06.67]I think this is gonna be, don't say that yet, maybe the last room before we restart.
[94:13.81]Maybe.
[94:15.75]I'm having fun though.
[94:16.67]I'm actually having fun.
[94:17.39]My stream works.
[94:19.95]Did you hear that everybody?
[94:20.75]His stream works.
[94:21.55]My stream actually works now.
[94:22.88]It's not like broken.
[94:24.02]It's not like messy.
[94:26.16]I didn't get shot with a gun.
[94:27.26]You didn't get shot with a gun.
[94:28.32]Like this game is going fine.
[94:32.46]Let me, uh, let me, like, get in the front.
[94:35.42]I'm gonna be the, uh, tank here.
[94:37.40]No, I'm not.
[94:40.00]Come on, man.
[94:40.52]There's, like, little baby spiders.
[94:41.68]Yeah, but these baby spiders... You can handle it.
[94:43.26]Hey, that's how they sneak up on you.
[94:44.32]They bite you.
[94:47.02]Why are you guys on me?
[94:53.13]You know, I could really do without.
[94:57.03]Let's talk about that.
[94:57.89]You want to do like a podcast here?
[94:59.99]Let's do a video game podcast.
[95:01.19]Yeah, video game podcast.
[95:02.65]Hold on.
[95:03.67]People have been asking that for ages.
[95:05.63]Make sure I don't die.
[95:06.23]I'm serious.
[95:06.99]I'm not even in the game right now.
[95:08.90]You're just walking.
[95:10.26]Oh, boy.
[95:11.40]Where am I?
[95:12.18]Okay.
[95:13.06]You're just walking in place.
[95:14.16]Okay, that's fine.
[95:15.08]Now you're back.
[95:17.28]We're going to do our intro, okay?
[95:20.16]You ready for the podcast intro?
[95:23.94]Here we go.
[95:25.14]So we're going to come up for like, after 10 seconds, we're going to come in, okay?
[95:29.43]The last time I did an interview this long, I was on cocaine.
[95:34.39]That is the ad before this.
[95:40.50]What?
[95:41.92]Why is that an ad?
[95:43.58]Why is that an ad on YouTube?
[95:46.74]Wait, we've got to watch this.
[95:48.10]This is a minute and 45 second ad?
[95:50.22]Give me a break.
[95:51.02]Okay, here we go.
[95:56.24]Oops.
[96:11.35]I can't hear anything right.
[96:13.05]Hey, welcome everybody.
[96:14.51]Check, uh, we're here at the
[96:36.03]We're here at the podcast.
[96:37.17]Welcome to the game, guys.
[96:38.29]My name's John, and I'm here with Dave.
[96:43.97]John and Dave, game guys.
[96:45.15]How you doing?
[96:47.01]Hey, guys.
[96:47.46]How you doing, John?
[96:49.10]I thought you were John.
[96:50.24]Yeah.
[96:50.92]So today, interestingly enough, I saw a couple things on the news pertaining to...
[96:59.16]Yeah, when I was prepping for the podcast today, I basically just went on Reddit and sorted by... Please, before I lose this, what were we just talking about before I did that?
[97:11.37]What?
[97:11.67]I lost it.
[97:12.15]What were we just talking about?
[97:14.51]You were about to do the joke podcast.
[97:16.19]Yeah, but before that, the reason why I started the podcast joke in the first place, what was it?
[97:19.42]What did I say?
[97:19.90]Let's talk about this.
[97:22.18]You didn't give me any information.
[97:23.90]I was like, let's talk about this.
[97:26.04]Well, we're both dead, so you have plenty of time to figure it out.
[97:29.86]Oh, hey, look, Comcast, the rolling brownout has shifted down my stream now, and now I have dropped frames.
[97:40.34]So we're going to play stream C tonight, where we just switch back and forth from one stream to the next.
[97:47.55]Yes, now I am dropping frames.
[97:49.23]Are we talking about rating games?
[97:50.27]No, we're talking about something else.
[97:51.69]Oh, my God.
[97:53.21]I'm about to go watch the bot.
[97:55.50]Is this the podcast joke?
[97:56.86]No, no, no.
[97:57.16]Wait, wait.
[97:57.50]We start the podcast and we don't know what we're supposed to talk about?
[98:00.61]Just put your points in.
[98:01.83]What was the topic today?
[98:02.65]Listen, I just told you I'm dropping frames.
[98:06.63]Oh, God.
[98:07.11]Why?
[98:07.45]Why does Comcast suck?
[98:11.21]How many points do I have?
[98:12.15]I have a bunch.
[98:13.54]Am I going to get to see the bot here?
[98:17.34]Ring?
[98:19.78]Explain to me some of the things you're doing.
[98:22.52]What?
[98:22.68]Are you talking to me?
[98:24.40]Yeah.
[98:24.84]Hold on.
[98:30.33]All right, here we go.
[98:32.59]The spiders spawn out of those?
[98:33.85]Oh, there's another one.
[98:34.93]Oh, those are mines.
[98:36.33]Look.
[98:37.69]Well, Comcast, and you sort this out.
[98:40.08]You entertain chat for a second.
[98:42.50]I got to go pee.
[98:43.34]You go pee.
[98:43.70]Oh, God.
[98:44.16]I can't jump over that shit.
[98:46.44]Careful.
[98:46.96]I can't jump over that stuff.
[98:49.36]In raiding, that's how you end up with how the game actually was.
[98:52.91]Yep.
[98:55.19]What was next?
[98:56.80]I have one hit.
[98:59.12]You have what looks like one hit.
[99:02.68]I think this is gonna be maybe the last room before we restart.
[99:09.15]I'm having fun though.
[99:12.63]I'm actually having fun.
[99:13.35]My stream works.
[99:15.94]Did you hear that, everybody?
[99:16.70]His stream works.
[99:17.50]My stream actually works now.
[99:18.84]It's not, like, broken.
[99:19.96]It's not, like, messy.
[99:22.10]I didn't get shot with a gun.
[99:23.08]You didn't get shot with a gun.
[99:24.28]Like, this game is going fine.
[99:26.58]No.
[99:26.86]What was it?
[99:28.42]Let me, like, get in the front.
[99:30.66]I'm going to be the tank here.
[99:32.81]Tank?
[99:33.37]No, I'm not.
[99:35.07]Come on, man.
[99:36.33]There's, like, little baby spiders.
[99:37.65]Yeah, but these baby spiders, that's how they sneak up on you.
[99:40.29]They bite you.
[99:41.11]What was I going to say?
[99:42.99]Why are you guys on me?
[99:49.08]You know, I can literally do without.
[99:52.28]Got it.
[99:52.50]Okay, I know what it is.

[101:25.53]I can't even hear the joke.
[101:27.49]I'm going to give you the 3, 2, 1, okay?
[101:28.91]Okay.
[101:29.89]Okay.
[101:43.67]Okay!
[101:46.26]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the game, guys.
[101:49.56]Another Sunday afternoon.
[101:53.82]Welcome again.
[101:54.72]Hopefully you all had a great, happy New Year.
[101:57.91]I know I did.
[101:59.07]Welcome, John.
[102:00.31]John is with us again, as you know.
[102:01.37]Hey, everybody.
[102:02.77]Hey, guys.
[102:02.95]So, I was at Walmart the other day, and first of all, hey, did you have any turkey on Thanksgiving there?
[102:09.87]Yeah, I had plenty of turkey.
[102:10.87]Turkey, dressing, ham, everything.
[102:12.80]Dressing.
[102:13.22]What kind of dressing do you put on there, man?
[102:14.26]We're being relatable and talking about how we're normal people.
[102:18.09]Well, you know, I had some delicious sweet potato casserole.
[102:20.76]Nice, nice, nice.
[102:21.68]Sweet potato casserole.
[102:22.52]How about yourself?
[102:23.00]Did you get to hang out with Susie?
[102:25.14]I did.
[102:25.78]I did.
[102:26.14]Me and Susie went to the Grand Ball, and she wore a dress, and it was nice.
[102:32.50]I wore a tuxedo.
[102:34.51]We're talking about normal, regular people.
[102:36.01]They're like regular people just like you.
[102:38.13]So anyways, I was at Walmart.
[102:40.77]You know Walmart, right?
[102:41.65]They're regular people.
[102:42.27]We shop at regular places just like you.
[102:45.51]I was at Walmart the other day, and I saw a Zelda.
[102:51.06]You know the game Zelda?
[102:52.74]I do.
[102:53.14]Are you a fan of that game?
[102:55.68]Well, you know, whenever somebody tells me about Zelda, I have to just let them know how profoundly it impacted my childhood.
[103:03.43]Right.
[103:03.79]Me too.
[103:06.51]So anyways, I was at line and somebody was... I was in line, I bought the game, I brought the game home and I noticed something really strange about it.
[103:14.50]And let me tell you, let me say how you feel about this, guys.
[103:17.10]So, how come every time Link swings his sword, he has to make noise?
[103:22.28]Do you understand that?
[103:23.56]John, you know what I'm talking about here?
[103:27.37]Every single time.
[103:28.51]At some point, does it get annoying to you?
[103:31.51]Do you find it to be irritating that every single time there has to be a recorded voice line every time you press the attack button?
[103:40.07]What you're referring to is the infamous, like, hi-yah sound effect.
[103:43.95]Yeah, like the hi-yah sound effect.
[103:46.71]What's the deal with that stuff?
[103:47.97]You know what I'm saying?
[103:49.57]Do we really need to have that anymore?
[103:51.09]Let's talk as a community.
[103:52.23]We're all about the community here.
[103:53.71]Give us a call if you agree.
[103:59.49]I'm dead.
[104:04.76]Don't worry.
[104:05.46]I'll get you in a minute.
[104:14.20]Anytime now.
[104:15.10]Are you going to get me?
[104:17.56]No.
[104:20.19]Don't worry, I'm gonna- Man, that's been the game, guys.
[104:23.90]Turn the game vol- Is the game volume that loud?
[104:26.18]What happened?
[104:30.62]Derma, this joke is not going the way that you think!
[104:34.04]Shh.
[104:36.00]No, none of that.
[104:37.40]Don't even get me started.
[104:40.30]That takes me to a different place.
[104:41.30]What the fuck?
[104:42.03]Why?
[104:43.93]Oh my god!
[104:53.17]I'm like nervous to cross this.
[104:56.85]See, it wasn't hard.
[104:58.43]It was hard.
[104:59.05]It wasn't easy.
[104:59.73]Is it still playing?
[105:04.40]Here's an app.
[105:12.71]What's going on?
[105:13.67]Why is this playing in the background?
[105:19.73]That was auto-playing.
[105:20.87]I'm sorry, Daleks.
[105:22.93]What?
[105:23.27]Why are you sorry?
[105:24.09]I can't hear anything that's happening.
[105:26.21]I'm just like blowing this whole stream right now.
[105:30.03]Alright, so I played that stupid rock song.
[105:33.60]Apparently this is... That's the shit joke that I made.
[105:37.82]Let me turn this off.
[105:41.53]The stream is dying again.
[105:46.41]It's off.
[105:47.05]Pretty sure you can't break this.
[105:48.67]No, you can't break this.
[105:49.33]But if you have a bomb, you have a bomb.
[105:51.25]I do have a bomb.
[105:52.32]I would love to try this.
[105:53.44]I thought I threw it over.
[105:55.20]We need more than... Wait.
[105:56.18]Do we need multiple bombs?
[105:58.24]You probably need more than one bomb.
[105:59.96]You just tripped on your own banana peel.
[106:03.90]And my stream's dead.
[106:06.71]So this is a Comcast-wide issue, it seems.
[106:10.72]Actually, yes.
[106:11.64]I am dropping frames now.
[106:13.35]So, this is not a me problem or a you problem.
[106:15.99]This is a Comcast... I think... No, my stream actually... We made the mistake of using the ISP that is most reviled in the United States.
[106:26.13]Oh.
[106:27.61]Well... Okay.
[106:30.35]Let's... Let's keep going.
[106:33.97]I only dropped like a couple frames, though.
[106:36.57]Yeah, I've dropped 100,000.
[106:41.35]I dropped 100,000 friends.
[106:42.11]100,000.
[106:42.15]Whoa.
[106:42.55]I need to get... I'm going to try to line up over here and get them all in a row.
[106:55.08]Anyways, Dave, in defense of the hi-yah sound effect, I have to say this would be a pretty eerily quiet game without a hi-yah every single time that I push the attack button.
[107:03.80]It would be just a little bit too quiet.
[107:06.89]I just don't understand, John, why there has to be a voice line for every swing.
[107:13.51]It kind of gets annoying.
[107:14.55]Let me ask you this, Dave.
[107:15.87]Have you ever watched women's tennis?
[107:19.17]I don't.
[107:20.05]Well, no, because I don't watch any sports.
[107:23.31]Well, it's a similar situation where when you exert much force, sometimes screeching and yelling can be heard as a result of that exertion.
[107:31.97]Okay.
[107:33.29]So, if anything, the hi-yah sound effect when exerting such leverage over especially hand-to-hand combat weapons, you're going to find that hi-yah is just a natural sound.
[107:42.48]It's an occurrence that happens in nature.
[107:44.70]We can find examples in the guerrilla world.
[107:48.68]Are you on webcam right now?
[107:50.24]No.
[107:50.74]You're not.
[107:51.20]Okay, I was going to say, please swing as hard as you can and see if you make any noise.
[107:57.63]Yay, back to the joke that's not funny.
[108:03.43]We have to fill time here because our streams aren't working.
[108:09.07]I'm going to get Magilnir.
[108:13.74]What the hell is that?
[108:14.72]Did you just get... What did you call it?
[108:16.74]I don't know.
[108:19.44]Mjolnir?
[108:20.00]It's Mjolnir.
[108:22.68]Oh.
[108:23.54]This guy hasn't even seen Thor.
[108:26.90]Actually, you know the answer to that question.
[108:28.54]I've never seen Thor.
[108:30.44]It was not a question.
[108:31.39]It was just this guy has never seen Thor.
[108:33.61]Well, that is technically kind of a question.
[108:36.43]Hey, how is your stream doing?
[108:38.27]Are you at more than a 500K up?
[108:40.41]Yes.
[108:41.01]Well, I am at 4,600 kilobits per second.
[108:47.31]Cool.
[108:48.91]This has been a great stream tonight.
[108:50.95]We've had lots of fun.
[108:52.33]I am in the green, actually.
[108:53.99]All right, which one do you want?
[108:55.14]Piggy bank?
[108:57.80]Every one gold you hold won by every 20 gold.
[109:01.64]All right, well, I have more money, so I should take that one.
[109:05.47]Okay.
[109:06.05]So you take the weird tech.
[109:07.35]The wearer can release erosion at the cost of hit points.
[109:11.43]That's actually what the title is.
[109:12.65]I said, grab the weird tentacle, and that's the name of this item.
[109:16.96]That's weird.
[109:18.56]Weird, man.
[109:19.06]Watch out.
[109:19.64]Wow, weird.
[109:20.12]You're going to get exploded if you stand that close.
[109:21.68]Wow.
[109:24.62]That's a dangerous game you're playing.
[109:25.68]Okay, you're good.
[109:27.46]I didn't even read and see what Mjolnir does.
[109:30.91]You just have it.
[109:32.27]I just own it.
[109:33.55]Okay.
[109:34.69]Mjolnir.
[109:35.65]Mjolnir.
[109:38.95]This is a great flip book stream.
[109:43.86]You know what it is?
[109:44.30]It's probably like the... Well, no, that doesn't make any sense.
[109:46.80]Because I was going to say it's the cold weather maybe, but that's not the case without a doubt.
[109:55.35]It's the cold weather.
[109:56.39]That's why my stream is lagging.
[109:57.53]Yeah, that's why your stream is lagging.
[110:01.14]You know how, like, when you go outside and your allergies kick off when it's the first of winter?
[110:05.76]Hey, watch out.
[110:09.08]Watch out for, like, the children's Halloween costume, uh, B-Max.
[110:12.88]What's his name?
[110:14.55]What's his name?
[110:14.89]The guy from Big Hero 6?
[110:15.71]I haven't seen that movie.
[110:18.21]Betamax?
[110:18.67]What's the guy's name?
[110:21.25]BMO?
[110:24.61]Oh, that joke would have been funnier if, uh... What were his names?
[110:32.35]The stream is still like this.
[110:33.77]Yeah.
[110:34.93]I'm trying to ride it out.
[110:36.35]Internet pipes are freezing over.
[110:47.43]Wooden chest.
[110:49.01]Betamax.
[110:51.15]The audio and visuals are all desynced.
[110:53.17]That's because I'm currently dealing with an internet problem.
[110:56.53]You know what?
[111:00.53]Sure.
[111:02.92]uh okay well not well mjolnir makes this uh 10 times stronger I think hey look I got I got I got some treats for you this thing's actually really cool you ready for this you ready yeah what how'd you do that
[111:20.17]Hey, no, give me that one back.
[111:21.39]Just take, give me the thing back.
[111:23.11]No, not all the apples.
[111:24.05]I want, I was just, I was just showing you how many I had.
[111:25.85]Oh, oh, I thought you, like, opened up a box or something.
[111:28.29]No, that was all, those were all my items.
[111:30.07]Oh.
[111:30.25]You can have, like, half of them because you're low on health.
[111:32.42]Okay, here, well, I'm going to eat these.
[111:33.22]You keep the apples.
[111:34.78]Okay, and you can have the, the, the man.
[111:36.56]No, I've got enough.
[111:37.54]What is this thing?
[111:40.84]Uh, if you get, uh, poisoned or something, it cures you.
[111:43.28]All right, well, that's fine.
[111:44.06]Let's go.
[111:47.37]Is it fixed?
[111:47.95]I hope.
[111:48.23]I don't know.
[111:48.53]I hope so.
[111:49.91]It's been really up and down this whole entire night.
[111:52.53]That's so stupid.
[111:53.78]In more ways than one.
[111:55.66]Oh, yeah.
[111:55.92]But, you know, we're having fun.
[111:58.18]We can skip this.
[111:58.84]We've already seen this before.
[111:59.86]This game is infinitely better than the last game.
[112:04.48]Oh, yeah.
[112:05.48]I have to stand still for this.
[112:08.38]It's not even really worth doing.
[112:09.38]I'm just going to keep doing that.
[112:13.06]You're supposed to dodge when you're this slow.
[112:17.26]Because I'm not Naruto running.
[112:18.54]I don't have enough speed.
[112:19.44]Oh, please.
[112:21.32]He's hungry.
[112:21.66]He's going to dive.
[112:25.62]And there he goes.
[112:27.00]This doesn't really do that much damage.
[112:30.29]That hurt.
[112:36.67]We are going to lose.
[112:37.65]Yes, we are.
[112:38.09]We're both too slow.
[112:46.17]No, I got stuck in the corner.
[112:47.83]That would be so funny if you tripped.
[112:51.15]I would think this was a 75 out of 70.
[112:53.24]I would find this a fun game.
[113:00.54]I honestly have to just run away and then dive.
[113:06.44]Honestly, you know what I'm missing in video games so far?
[113:11.24]What if I happen to the guys blinking?
[113:13.24]What if I happen to the bosses blinking?
[113:14.84]That means you're getting close to winning.
[113:17.29]Oh, like flashing red?
[113:18.75]Yeah, remember Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
[113:21.31]When you would get Baxter down to 10% health, he would start blinking, and then blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink.
[113:27.64]I'd rather that.
[113:29.46]Get this hug, get the health bars off the screen, bring back the blinking enemies.
[113:32.74]Well, at least he flashes when you do damage to him.
[113:39.07]We're good.
[113:43.11]Ow.
[113:44.17]Don't worry, I'll just take all that.
[113:46.97]right what's in the master chest a lot of stuff uh another suit of armor uh dagger this is a two-handed thing forbidden book careful when you open this okay I'll be careful 10 hp uh you just grab that you take the barbarian armor
[114:08.88]barbarian armor yeah but it just looks like it's it's for like up front tank people right it's got plus 30 health plus six defense I get well I mean it I guess it's just huge fine I'll take the health we'll compare the stats to the other thing yeah do you want the mithril sword no I I'll stick with the uh the two-hander 200 is good I don't know I think I think I'll stick with range for now but it's ruined yeah
[114:34.14]Well, don't worry.
[114:34.78]There ain't gonna be a really watchable VOD from this one.
[114:38.76]Sorry, guys.
[114:39.50]I go like this.
[114:42.90]I spin around.
[114:54.11]No, I meant like with the sword and shield when I hit trigger.
[114:57.37]So when you right trigger, it just gives you like a little overheal and it gets stacked.
[115:04.23]And if you hold Y, it just blocks.
[115:06.23]It doesn't block all damage, it only blocks like a percentage.
[115:09.35]Let's go.
[115:12.70]I'm a little hurt right now.
[115:15.96]This is a really nice still video.
[115:19.53]You know what?
[115:20.16]We're going to play this game again at some point here, right?
[115:24.06]Don't you feel like we need to beat this game on video?
[115:26.26]I feel like this is a beatable game.
[115:27.92]This is a beatable video game.
[115:28.96]This is not an early access doesn't work game.
[115:31.50]No.
[115:31.82]The game works.
[115:33.23]The game works.
[115:33.75]Our streams just don't.
[115:35.31]That's the problem.
[115:43.09]I like that one.
[115:47.03]Yeah, sorry, guys.
[115:48.41]I uploaded the... What's the idea?
[115:52.17]Hold on.
[115:52.43]Wait right there.
[115:53.15]Okay.
[115:55.95]What's your idea?
[115:56.83]I was gonna... I was gonna see if there was a sound setting to turn off vocals, and we could just try seeing how awkward the game sounds without, like, the high up.
[116:09.98]That would be pretty awkward.
[116:14.95]Without the Hayao, it would be pretty weird.
[116:22.16]Because it is like 85% of the sound.
[116:24.04]It doesn't have an actual... Well, at that point, just turn all the sound off.
[116:32.54]I have been captured.
[116:34.10]I think I'm about to use the book.
[116:35.62]I'm captured twice.
[116:36.30]I'm going to use the book and see what happens.
[116:39.79]Polymorph.
[116:40.51]Well, that's a mass polymorph.
[116:42.03]That actually is pretty useful.
[116:43.41]Remember that for next time.
[116:49.99]Okay, when they come out of Polymorph, it's a little dangerous.
[116:52.93]I have this weird lady that's dropping money behind me.
[116:57.13]Take advantage of it.
[116:59.31]Grab the money.
[116:59.81]How long does she last?
[117:05.23]I don't know.
[117:06.60]Maybe she just follows you around and thinks dying.
[117:08.86]That'd be amazing.
[117:09.52]Alright, watch out for this guy.
[117:12.90]Really?
[117:13.22]I tried to... What happened to your head?
[117:14.46]I don't know.
[117:16.06]I got like... Whatever those ten...
[117:21.35]No, that was you.
[117:22.42]That was you.
[117:22.78]I'm going out with a bang when he comes back here.
[117:26.34]I'm going to spin into him.
[117:28.64]You will not get that chance.
[117:33.12]And open.
[117:33.70]There better be a lot of food in here.
[117:37.42]Yes, there is.
[117:40.62]You want the medallion?
[117:41.32]I can have one banana.
[117:42.98]Fire a bolt of pure magic.
[117:45.45]This action will exhaust the magic of this pendant.
[117:48.41]Okay.
[117:51.25]Well, how about this?
[117:54.33]If this doesn't start to correct itself here, then we kind of have to stop streaming.
[118:01.11]We've been going for a couple hours now.
[118:03.41]It looks like it's not going to stay put.
[118:07.04]For whatever reason, mine's stable now.
[118:09.78]I don't know.
[118:11.96]All I know is it's... Oh boy, you're dead.
[118:17.50]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[118:18.38]I've only dropped 1,600 frames total.
[118:22.00]I dropped way more than that.
[118:23.94]You dropped like 160,000.
[118:24.90]A lot.
[118:25.44]This time I don't want to blow it.
[118:34.73]I got cocooned.
[118:35.79]Oh boy, this is not good.
[118:37.27]Get me out of there!
[118:44.27]Hello?
[118:44.86]Woo!
[118:48.56]Why?
[118:48.78]Will you please give me one second?
[118:49.86]Don't just sprint around.
[118:50.74]He's going to do it again.
[118:53.08]Oh boy.
[118:54.70]Don't do it.
[118:54.98]Comcast likes me better.
[118:56.30]Yeah, they do.
[118:57.16]For some reason.
[118:59.42]Ah!
[119:03.16]This time.
[119:03.68]Game over.
[119:05.04]This time.
[119:07.28]I'm not going to not spend the points.
[119:12.95]Got to watch me first.
[119:13.85]So let's watch you first.
[119:16.17]I've been going down the potion tree.
[119:18.01]What is this?
[119:18.61]Better crucible.
[119:20.46]Oh, we have to talk to the pharmacist and we get free potions.
[119:22.83]Okay.
[119:24.05]But isn't this just for you?
[119:26.39]I think we both get to use it.
[119:29.05]Restore more health when eating food.
[119:30.75]Okay.
[119:32.93]There.
[119:33.63]Too bad resetting the router isn't a potential fix.
[119:35.68]No.
[119:37.46]I think that's all I can do.
[119:39.88]I've had this issue with Comcast like a hundred times now.
[119:43.28]There's been times when I haven't been able to stream for like a full two weeks.
[119:48.27]All right, what we got here?
[119:48.89]Increase attack damage.
[119:50.41]Yeah, I'll do that.
[119:51.03]What does it cost?
[119:52.45]14.
[119:52.47]All right, I got some points here.
[119:55.91]Oh, we're back down.
[120:16.38]All right, it's time to Unfortunately guys I Think how are you doing?
[120:23.30]Are you still all right?
[120:25.44]Yeah, I'm still okay.
[120:26.60]Oh man.

[120:42.01]I paid my bills, you know?
[120:43.17]I pay extra.
[120:45.15]Yeah, we pay extra.
[120:47.00]We pay extra.
[120:47.84]I pay extra to be able to stream.
[120:49.08]You know, with that net neutrality, I gotta pay extra to get that Twitch.tv functionality.
[120:54.82]Gotta go on the highway.
[120:56.61]I've... Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.
[121:01.31]When I look down at my OBS and I see that 30% of every frame has dropped, it gets to a point where I just don't want to do it.
[121:09.48]It's just not going to happen.
[121:16.20]Sometimes it works for a minute or two and then it stops working for 15 minutes.
[121:20.18]Are you shitting on the ground?
[121:28.27]At least we got to see that, right?
[121:34.49]It's done.
[121:35.07]It's done.
[121:35.55]That's all.
[121:35.97]Wait, wait, wait.
[121:36.67]You weren't controlling that.
[121:37.53]Too many bananas in my diet.
[121:40.10]Get too much fiber.
[121:41.32]Oh, Lord.
[121:41.78]No, wait.
[121:43.86]It's good.
[121:44.36]No, it ain't.
[121:45.16]It's dead.
[121:47.20]It's dead in the water.
[121:58.25]Well, it's Alex.
[122:00.01]Would you like to do a rain check?
[122:04.38]Uh, we can.
[122:05.58]If you want to pause it for later.
[122:09.00]What's your, um... What's your plan over the next, like, couple days, Italics?
[122:15.84]What's your plan?
[122:17.16]What is your plan tomorrow?
[122:20.54]Uh... None streaming related.
[122:24.08]None streaming related.
[122:26.37]Would you like to kind of postpone this until either, like, till tomorrow or until Thursday?
[122:34.14]Do you want to do, like, one more life?
[122:37.96]I'm at, like, 0k right now.
[122:40.52]We can.
[122:41.02]I mean, I'm going to have to turn my stream off.
[122:44.02]It's up to you.
[122:48.42]Let's just... I'm going to just turn my stream off.
[122:53.05]And we'll do another life on yours, and we'll just go from there.
[122:57.59]Okay.
[122:59.24]Alright, guys.
[123:00.22]My stream is turning off.
[123:02.36]So, I'm sorry.
[123:04.96]Me and Italics are going to do at least one more life on his stream.
[123:08.52]Because this is not watchable.
[123:13.46]So, thank you for watching.
[123:16.52]I would say a lot more things, but let's just get the show rolling here.
[123:22.92]I might just stream tomorrow.
[123:25.32]We are not allowed to have a smooth...
[123:30.05]stream unless it's local only.
[123:32.03]It's true, I know.
[123:33.55]But if for some reason I don't stream tomorrow or we don't do it again tomorrow, then I'll see you on Thursday.
[123:38.99]Thank you so much.
[123:39.61]Goodbye, everybody.

[123:45.32]Thank you for the donations.
[123:46.16]Thank you for the subs.

[123:52.76]It's my fault.
[123:54.04]No, I'm just saying, like, we've got to go.
