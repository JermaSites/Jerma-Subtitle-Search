[00:02.10]Yo, what is up guys?
[00:03.52]It's Jerma again with a gameplay commentary.
[00:05.92]This time I am on King of the Hill Viaduct.
[00:08.46]There's actually going to be two gameplays in this commentary.
[00:11.23]There's going to be one on Viaduct and then one on Turbine, Capture the Flag Turbine.
[00:15.93]These gameplays were taken from my event that I had this afternoon where I made everybody flood an empty server.
[00:22.73]I know that a lot of you guys had some bad ping and I'm really, really sorry about that, but it will get better over time.
[00:28.67]I plan on getting my own server at some point here, so...
[00:31.55]Let's get into the gameplay.
[00:32.59]This is an engineer, combat engineer, using the Mini Sentry, the Frontier Justice, and the pistol, I believe.
[00:39.60]Yep, the pistol.
[00:41.46]So my Mini Sentry here gets three or four assists in a row, and I get a couple kills with it, which allows me to switch over to the Frontier Justice and get the revenge crits.
[00:50.78]I destroy it.
[00:51.80]Come over here.
[00:52.40]This spy just destroys one of my teammates, but I get him right in the back.
[00:56.02]This jumping Demoman goes down, too.
[00:57.86]Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom, ba-da-bum.
[00:59.34]And then I get backstabbed by Larry the Combat Spy, who had it out for me the whole afternoon, and I was raging Cajun, man.
[01:08.67]I'm telling you right now, I was a raging Cajun.
[01:11.41]So anyways, guys, if you haven't checked out the Borderlands Let's Play that me and Lepter are doing right now, go check it out.
[01:17.74]That's where I've been for the last couple days.
[01:19.70]We've recorded a lot of footage, so I hope you guys check it out.
[01:22.30]Go over to Lepter's channel and check that out.
[01:25.29]Getting this teleporter up to level 3, which you never see people do this on a King of the Hill map, which is, it's very, very important.
[01:30.95]Because level 3 teleporters make this insanely easy for your team just to get right to the front lines.
[01:36.31]I somehow kill somebody.
[01:37.81]Who did I just kill right there?
[01:39.49]Was that a disguise spy that I killed with that pistol?
[01:41.61]I just had no idea.
[01:43.24]So I turn around.
[01:43.88]This guy's on fire.
[01:44.74]He goes down with a couple of shots with a shotgun.
[01:47.08]This Pyro, I knew he was going to come up here.
[01:48.78]I'm trying to lure him up here with the Mini Sentry.
[01:50.88]I end up doing a great job of it.
[01:52.20]He gets killed.
[01:53.86]Trying to get a little bit healthier.
[01:55.04]I thought the health was going to respawn, but there's a dispenser.
[01:56.96]There was like two other engineers that were on the team, so it actually worked out pretty well.
[02:02.68]So I go down by a mini sentry from the other team.
[02:06.43]Captain Defender had one place in a good spot.
[02:09.17]And then Famous Amos, just being a real psycho, comes over and tries to repair my mini sentry.
[02:14.61]And I'm not sure if he knows that or not, but Famous Amos, dude, you're the man for trying anyways.
[02:18.61]I appreciate it.
[02:20.09]So let's respawn here.
[02:20.99]Come out getting my teleporter that I bailed to level 3.
[02:24.20]And this is where things get a little kooky because there's just too much crap going on.
[02:28.66]I come over here with the mini sentry placed and there's an uber charge.
[02:32.15]I run out of the way because I'm not going to get myself killed and wait for like a 25 second respawn.
[02:36.78]Double engineers building up a dispenser level 3.
[02:38.00]And then Larry the combat spy again gets me with a backstab.
[02:43.00]So that's not good but what is good is the fact that my mini sentry has got a couple more assists before it goes down.
[02:49.00]So we have less than a minute left, they haven't even gotten on to the point yet, which is good because we are probably going to win this round.
[02:58.46]There's an engineer on the other team trying to build a big sentry up on the top right corner.
[03:02.61]It does end up going up, which causes a little bit of problem, but it's okay.
[03:06.61]Our teammates are doing well enough where it's not a big deal.
[03:09.23]I almost die from it, but I end up hiding in this corner, and I'm not going to get myself killed by that.
[03:15.28]My Mini Sentry gets an assist, and I get the revenge crits trying to get something happening, trying to get something going.
[03:20.72]Build a little Mini Sentry just to keep this point secure.
[03:23.14]I thought I missed that Engineer, but I guess I hit him with the tail end of a pellet.
[03:27.33]So now, I try and do some, like, sneaky spy bullshit, and it doesn't work.
[03:31.81]You'll see what I'm talking about.
[03:32.67]I get behind everybody, and then watch this.
[03:34.47]I'm gonna get this guy.
[03:35.49]Ready?
[03:35.91]One, two, three...
[03:37.71]No! It didn't work! Ah!
[03:40.00]And I just die. But uh, that would have been really funny if it worked.
[03:42.00]I tried- probably should have tried to taunt kill them or something but we end up winning the game with a flawless victory.
[03:47.00]Jerma number one baby. Even though it doesn't even matter, who cares.
[03:51.00]We're just playing for fun here and now we're going to move on to a medic gameplay.
[03:55.00]Not really medic gameplay, I just want to kind of showcase the Quick-Fix and why I found a couple of good uses for it and why I changed my mind on it a little, I guess.
[04:05.50]So the loadout for this match is going to be the Quick-Fix, the Ubersaw, and the Overdose.
[04:11.37]I find this to be a very, very interesting setup because it allows you to be a combat medic, a real combat medic, because you can run faster when you have Ubercharge on the Overdose.
[04:21.49]So it allows you to run around really fast and smash people like this.
[04:24.76]Even though he's disguised and he was a Dead Ringer, it's okay.
[04:28.34]I still made him have to use his cloak.
[04:30.90]So let me show you now a good reason to use the Quick-Fix.
[04:33.56]This is a good example right here.
[04:35.10]Three or four people in a row come over to me and I heal them all to full health within five seconds, which you would not be able to do with any of the other medi guns.
[04:42.43]It's huge because now these three guys, these four guys now have full health, ready to run to the flag to get it.
[04:49.58]And now I have an uber charge and this is where it really, really, really, really is cool because you'll see what happens.
[04:55.48]The guy with the flag really starts... Oh, watch this by the way, nice like fail.
[04:58.74]Dude, let me like jump the fence.
[05:00.12]Oh, no, I gotta walk over it.
[05:01.52]So this is a great example right here.
[05:02.76]I pop it.
[05:03.41]These two people need health bad.
[05:05.07]Boom, boom, full health automatically.
[05:08.05]Amazing.
[05:09.29]Really, really cool.
[05:10.47]If I had the regular Medi Gun, I would be able to ubercharge one person and the rest of them would just die.
[05:15.83]With the Kritzkrieg, I would have had to just give somebody crits and they could have just died instantly from just somebody spamming with a rocket or something.
[05:22.01]But not with the Quick-Fix.
[05:23.39]If you're using the Quick-Fix, especially on a capture the flag map,
[05:27.39]Everybody's trying to protect this one person that has the flag.
[05:30.70]And Turbine, Turbine is a pretty small quarters capture the flag map.
[05:34.86]So everybody's kind of in that one middle area if somebody has the flag.
[05:38.60]In a place like Two Fort, there's like five different places you can go.
[05:41.15]There's sewers, you can go around the top if you're a soldier, you can go down the bottom.
[05:44.89]But Turbine, you really need to protect your teammates, especially the guy with the flag.
[05:48.63]And that guy had like five health left.
[05:50.87]And even if I ubercharged him, the sniper that was next to him, the other medic that was right there, probably could have just died.
[05:56.84]And then by the time that the ubercharge is done, if you had the regular Medi Gun, you're talking about it's you versus the world.
[06:02.82]You and the soldier versus the world.
[06:04.46]So it's great to have the Quick-Fix and keep everybody on the same page.
[06:08.00]That's why it's a fantastic new item.
[06:11.15]Anyways, you'll notice that there was a cut.
[06:14.05]And what I'm doing is, I don't want to show a full gameplay, because I didn't really do that good in this particular gameplay.
[06:18.90]I was getting kind of owned by a lot of people.
[06:21.04]But this is a good example of why I underestimated the Quick-Fix, and why I will not underestimate it anymore.
[06:27.06]This spy goes down from Bacon, and me and Bacon really, really rip shit up right here because of the ubercharge on this item.
[06:34.17]I try to save this guy's life, but it doesn't work.
[06:36.25]I ubercharge Bacon, and watch this.
[06:38.25]He kills one, two, three...
[06:40.99]Four, five, six, seven people with the Uber Charge of the Quick-Fix.
[06:46.58]So, Bacon, that was a pretty sick run, and I will never, ever again pretend like the Uber Charge on this item is not sufficient.
[06:54.96]Come back over here with these two soldiers.
[06:56.60]I get whipped, which makes this run really fast.
[06:58.98]And we are going to cap this point, and we're going to win three to nothing.
[07:02.26]I don't make it to the top of the charts, but that's okay.
[07:05.22]These other guys have done a fantastic job, so I really appreciate them coming in.
[07:09.02]This event was a lot of fun, guys.
[07:10.40]I'll do a whole lot more of these.
[07:12.14]And thank you for watching again so much.
[07:14.86]I appreciate it.
[07:15.67]And I promise you guys, sooner or later, I'll get my own damn server so you don't have to deal with any of this bull crap anymore.
[07:22.87]So thanks a lot, guys.
[07:24.09]We filled the server.
[07:24.91]Let's do it again sometime soon.
[07:26.61]Thanks a lot.
[07:27.07]Take care, guys.
