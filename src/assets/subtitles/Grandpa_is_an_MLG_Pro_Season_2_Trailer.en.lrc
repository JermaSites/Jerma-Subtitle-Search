[00:15.27]Life.
[00:16.95]Where does it begin?
[00:20.16]And where does it ultimately end?
[00:23.66]The next two minutes are an experiment.
[00:28.46]One like you've never seen before.
[00:31.63]And I only say that because I know that'll make you keep watching.
[00:36.05]And I never explain in the video what the experiment is.
[00:40.32]But, you know, I don't give a shit.
[00:42.04]You're gonna watch.
[00:43.18]So, this is Grandpa Season 2.
[00:47.72]The premiere is just coming soon.
[00:50.32]So get your ass in gear and sit the fuck down and watch this trailer.
[00:55.34]See you later, motherfuckers.
[00:56.36]That's what I like to see, baby.
[01:03.99]This season we're going to be going huge.
[01:06.59]We got special guests.
[01:08.57]This is Hollywood.
[01:09.78]Why am I on this piece of shit show?
[01:11.56]What's going on?
[01:12.62]We got explosions.
[01:16.24]We got explosions on top of fucking explosions.
[01:24.38]That's right!
[01:25.20]We got a budget this season, and you better believe that I'm gonna spend every single fucking cent of the 700 million dollars they gave me!
[01:35.22]And I, um, I may have actually already spent it on a giant gold statue in my front lawn.
[01:43.47]Now, you know, forget I said that, because you're not gonna be mad at me about that.
[01:48.18]Season 2 of Grandpa is in MLG Pro.
[01:52.30]Coming soon.
[01:53.52]So make sure you subscribe to Jerma985 and Machinima Respawn for different updates and because you just should anyways.
[02:02.59]And I'm talking to you, Steve Williams!
[02:05.63]You haven't fucking subscribed yet, and I'm looking at you right now!
[02:09.33]You know, I really just freaked somebody out, because statistically, there's gotta be somebody named Steve Williams watching this right now, so...
[02:17.84]So mark it on your calendars and get ready for the adventure.
[02:22.46]And bye.
[02:23.80]See you later.
[02:24.68]It's the end of the video.
[02:26.90]So I... It's been a long time.
[02:29.97]I actually don't know how to stop the recording.
[02:32.95]Whatever.
[02:33.41]Jeremy will do it.
[02:35.49]Hey.
[02:36.29]Hey, Jet.
[02:37.55]Hey, Hattie.
[02:38.41]Come here and turn this off.
[02:41.17]Feed me, too.
[02:41.91]I'm hungry.
[02:43.30]When I tell you to do something, I expect it done immediately.
