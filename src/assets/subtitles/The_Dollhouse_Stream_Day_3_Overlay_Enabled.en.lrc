[08:42.84]Dama!
[08:43.05]Chibatama!
[08:43.71]Ho ho!
[10:27.60]I can see my armpits, so I'm not lifting my arms up.
[18:08.03]I feel like I'm making a TikTok video.
[18:09.29]Who can see like the flip I was doing?
[18:10.63]I'm just going...
[18:48.00]That's a little too big.
[20:11.58]you
[22:31.86]We're making a TikTok video.
[22:33.19]Who could see the flip I was doing?
[22:34.51]I'm just going...
[23:11.77]Just a little too big.
[27:54.64]Hey, welcome to the street, everybody.
[28:12.88]Hey, welcome.
[28:17.96]One, two, three, two.
[28:21.37]Hey, welcome to the stream, everybody.
[28:22.61]It's me, Jerma985 here.
[28:24.53]Just getting to my house that was just recently fixed and upgraded, hopefully.
[28:38.41]Ow.
[28:41.03]If I put too much pressure on it, it just... Ow.
[28:43.77]Ow.
[28:50.85]How's everybody doing?
[28:53.25]Hopefully everybody's okay.
[28:55.29]Hope everybody's feeling okay.
[28:56.89]Hope everybody's doing okay.
[28:59.73]I am not doing okay.
[29:03.25]This is probably the worst I've ever felt since... I don't know.
[29:08.34]I don't have a barometer for this because this is the worst ever.
[29:13.30]Oh yeah.
[29:15.59]What do we got up here?
[29:19.98]What's this?
[29:26.42]Wait, wait.
[29:27.86]I got trapped in the wall.
[29:29.68]I got trapped in the wall.
[29:33.09]I got stuck in the wall.
[29:35.29]I can't.
[29:36.27]There it is.
[29:37.01]Okay.
[29:37.45]I got stuck back there.
[29:41.99]I got stuck in the wall.
[29:46.43]What is this?
[29:49.01]Ooh, I didn't know about this.
[29:53.89]This looks like a staircase.
[29:57.82]Oh wow, I really like what they did here.
[30:01.50]Ooh, second floor.
[30:06.10]Wow, interesting stuff.
[30:11.42]I didn't finish this one.
[30:12.50]This one wasn't finished.
[30:14.39]I was gonna hopefully do some of that today, some work, but I don't feel like doing any work right now.
[30:24.43]They told me that I could finish it however I wanted.
[30:31.10]What else is up here?
[30:36.32]Oh, yes, the stuff I bought.
[30:39.08]Bed, another bedroom.
[30:44.27]This one gives me less comfort than this one.
[30:53.63]I look like Clark Kent, but if he was smaller, didn't go to law school, and never went to the gym.
[31:04.64]I look like fucking Otacon.
[31:09.58]Yes, Snake, what you need to do is, but I'm not smart enough to be that guy.
[31:14.64]I like this bedroom though.
[31:19.62]Ow!
[31:20.40]Yay, ow!
[31:22.20]So for those of you that weren't here yesterday, the old house got kind of burnt and we got some insurance money, which was immediately used to fix the damage and to upgrade the home.
[31:37.91]So now we have two floors.
[31:40.99]We've got a DIY room.
[31:43.65]And we've got all the other rooms that you've seen already.
[31:47.49]Thank you, oh my God.
[31:52.52]Now the thing about these stairs is they go down pretty far.
[31:54.80]This is a very high, this is a very far house.
[31:58.28]So it takes a few minutes to get down the stairs.
[32:02.60]Takes about 10 seconds, a very big house.
[32:06.55]That was just huge.
[32:11.62]That's not the bathroom.
[32:12.92]That's not the bathroom.
[32:13.72]I went to the wrong door.
[32:18.16]That's the wrong door.
[32:19.98]I gotta go to the bathroom real bad.
[32:27.31]Thank you.
[32:27.67]Get out of here.
[32:35.52]I don't even want to use it.
[32:49.81]I don't think I've washed my hands in a week and a half.
[32:55.05]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[32:56.99]Okay, is it healed yet?
[32:58.94]Let's find out.
[33:05.18]I feel better.
[33:05.66]Can I get this off too?
[33:13.24]Oh shit, this is clipped on.
[33:16.43]it's clipped onto my body it's gonna stay they just have bird shit on me oh thanks seagull and by the way I know you like the robe I know you do but but I it's too hot up here to wear this 24-7 I'll put it on at other times okay huge bird shit on me
[33:44.06]Can I put this somewhere?
[33:46.06]It's way too hot to wear this.
[33:49.15]Do you know how hot it is?
[33:51.11]I can't put this on.
[33:53.29]And by the way, these don't fit.
[33:55.89]I was so concerned that these were going to get picked because they don't fit.
[34:00.14]It's a disaster.
[34:02.14]So I'm going to be walking around like this is a diaper.
[34:05.80]What do you mean wear the robe or no food?
[34:10.51]Wear the robe, hold on.
[34:12.13]Obviously, I can't see that today to take my glasses off.
[34:14.61]No robe, no food.
[34:21.27]Fine, what did you hear?
[34:27.20]Alright, I'll put the robe back on.
[34:29.88]But if there's like an article written later this afternoon about like streamer dies of heat stroke on stream, remember whose fault it was.
[34:49.64]I guess I'll have a cookie.
[34:53.66]Fresh baked cookies.
[34:55.72]Fresh baked cookies from eight days ago.
[34:58.79]Pretty good.
[35:06.59]It's not even good.
[35:07.42]I feel like this is dead.
[35:15.60]Like, Dad, you're having like a sleepover, like you come up, it's like 2 o'clock in the morning, you come out here, you're getting a snack for you and your friends, and I'm Dad.
[35:23.68]Like, oh, hey, son, what's going on in there?
[35:28.12]You guys are supposed to be asleep.
[35:30.28]I keep hearing noises in there.
[35:33.19]You got to cut that out, son.
[35:36.85]I got a big thesis coming up next Monday.
[35:40.69]Do you want some milk?
[35:43.61]Of course you don't.
[35:48.84]That was a good cookie.
[35:50.50]I love how cookie equals entire meal.
[35:55.59]One thing I had to make really clear is eating on this stream, eating on stream, right?
[36:02.99]I can't eat like a full dinner every day.
[36:05.75]I can't, what, you want me to eat like a full plate of steak or something?
[36:08.33]No, I'm going to eat a cookie and I'm good.
[36:11.68]And I'm like, I have to finish the cookie, right?
[36:15.96]I can't just throw like a quarter of a cookie away.
[36:17.80]Give me a shower.
[36:32.80]Wait, wait.
[36:43.83]Let's go for a shower.
[36:47.81]with my glasses on.
[36:51.29]Hey, ask Reddit.
[36:53.21]What's something you do in the shower that people know and it's like we all know?
[36:58.28]Oh man, I go in the shower with my glasses on all the time and they fog up.
[37:01.38]Fuck me too, 10,000 up folks.
[37:17.35]You know, I don't think there'll ever be one stream where we don't, like, do, like, the fart is funny joke.
[37:23.85]You know, I thought we could get, we don't, this is the third one.
[37:28.10]This is day three.
[37:31.88]But, like, look, if it, whatever, how do I even describe, explain myself here?
[37:46.24]At least I feel clean.
[37:47.16]I need to go.
[37:59.10]I want to go to my bed.
[38:02.75]I want to go into my bed.
[38:03.67]Oh, these stairs.
[38:12.43]I don't even want stairs.
[38:15.68]I wanted a flat house where I could walk around in.
[38:26.56]This is going to be fun, but I don't want to do it.
[38:30.50]What's that?
[38:32.36]What's that?
[38:33.74]What's that?
[38:34.85]Jerma.ed5.com?
[38:37.31]Jerma.ed5.com official merchandise.
[38:41.21]Don't go and don't go there.
[38:47.44]Let me see if there's any butterflies.
[38:48.64]Let me see if there's any butterflies.
[38:52.26]I can catch them from here.
[39:00.12]Oh, look, there goes one.
[39:02.34]Oh, wow.
[39:06.27]This looks like I'm trapped in here.
[39:09.17]Like, hey, excuse me, I'm locked in here.
[39:11.49]Can somebody help me?
[39:13.85]Can you catch me a butterfly?
[39:19.60]I'm too tired.
[39:21.63]I can't catch butterflies.
[39:27.01]My robe got stuck.
[39:29.80]Alright, I'll go catch butterflies.
[39:34.06]Sleep would have been a great option.
[39:39.91]You know, go to sleep.
[39:45.17]But fine, I'll go and catch a few butterflies, like I care, whatever.
[39:59.54]I can make it.
[40:01.42]I can make it, I think I can make it.
[40:04.30]But no, of course not.
[40:06.60]I didn't even show you outside, I didn't even show you, but we can look at something else too, we can look at the pool.
[40:11.28]I have a pool now.
[40:22.36]I always fell over.
[40:22.94]I had to just ground myself for a second.
[40:28.32]Otherwise, I would have puked.
[40:31.26]We got a pool.
[40:33.20]And, oh, cool!
[40:35.16]Oh, yay!
[40:36.22]Ow, arm.
[40:39.61]Oh!
[40:41.03]Butterflies!
[40:44.01]Oh, my God!
[40:45.37]This is a huge net for a butterfly.
[40:49.67]What are we catching, Mothra?
[40:52.49]From fucking Godzilla?
[40:56.05]Oh, I think I got one.
[40:57.72]I think I got... I didn't know that was still turned on.
[41:04.80]Oh, cool, butterflies.
[41:06.10]Wonder what songs do butterflies like?
[41:11.34]Ow, one bit me in the neck.
[41:13.35]Ow.
[41:16.19]Ow.
[41:19.49]That's a pool.
[41:43.34]I gotta get to bed right now.
[41:49.56]I'm so tired.
[41:50.52]Just need one night's sleep of good rest in a bed.
[41:54.84]That's all I need, that's all I want.
[42:11.06]Oh, the bed is calling me.
[42:13.18]It's screaming at me.
[48:49.88]I feel great.
[48:53.50]What a good night's sleep, holy smokes.
[48:58.51]Oh man, I feel like I could write a book.
[49:01.83]I feel like I could write a play.
[49:02.87]I feel like I could write a novel.
[49:03.91]I feel like I could go for a jog.
[49:05.10]Oh, I feel fucking incredible.
[49:07.58]Damn, what a good night's sleep can do for you.
[49:09.98]And a good food.
[49:11.60]All that good stuff.
[49:13.34]It's coming off.
[49:20.42]It's clipped into the microphone.
[49:22.91]At some point we're gonna have to actually do something about this.
[49:29.17]Oh, I feel good though.
[49:30.89]What a day.
[49:35.28]Ooh, projects, mystery box.
[49:38.06]What's in here?
[49:39.70]Why is there a mystery box up here?
[49:44.34]Sounds like a pretty good day to check the mail.
[49:49.68]I got up a little too fast and I almost just burped.
[49:54.26]I created a bunch of gas when I just came up really quickly.
[49:58.70]And, uh, yeah, I almost just burped on camera.
[50:04.27]Let's check the mail.
[50:11.69]Ooh, I feel so good I could probably even come out backwards.
[50:16.48]I can.
[50:18.34]Why don't we do it here too?
[50:19.70]Bet you I can come out backwards.
[50:28.13]Oh shit.
[50:33.55]That's new, whatever it is.
[50:43.84]There's a piece of mail in here.
[50:46.04]It's probably one of these kids in the neighborhood.
[50:49.39]What does it say?
[50:54.69]This says, Jerma, thank you for involving us in such a unique experience.
[50:58.09]We have had the time of our lives.
[51:00.81]The crew.
[51:01.25]I actually wrote that.
[51:06.83]I actually wrote that.
[51:07.53]That's actually really nice.
[51:09.16]Without a crew like this, this is not possible.
[51:13.18]This is by far one of the coolest things I've ever done, and by far some of the best people I've ever worked with in my whole life.
[51:18.68]And I really mean that.
[51:21.34]All of you.
[51:22.62]There's tons of people back here, tons of people backstage.
[51:24.38]You can't even see them.
[51:27.80]But clean this shit up.
[51:34.76]Ooh, a unicorn!
[51:37.54]Wow.
[51:41.36]Oh, it's huge.
[51:43.77]Oh, dude.
[51:45.35]Stone cold.
[51:47.35]Oh, stunner.
[51:51.67]Don't hurt him.
[51:52.17]Don't hurt him.
[51:52.81]I'm not.
[51:53.25]He's fine.
[51:57.32]Pool.
[51:59.30]I can't wait to potentially go swimming in that pool with absolute water in it.
[52:04.67]You know, fun fact for those of you behind the scenes stuff, there's supposed to be water in there, it's supposed to be a full pool, but last minute we decided, what an absolute dangerous hazard considering there is a transformer right there.
[52:22.81]Hey dude.
[52:38.52]I do feel good, though.
[52:39.46]This is a good day.
[52:42.76]Going to work.
[52:44.37]You got it.
[52:45.01]I'm in such a good mood.
[52:52.67]Oh, hey, can you cue up?
[52:59.65]Can you cue up like somebody gets, like, fucking speared sound?
[53:03.52]Can you cue up like somebody gets, like, like, speared sound?
[53:07.18]Could you get that, like, right now?
[53:11.18]Okay, I want like a skewed up spear sound, somebody gets hit with a spear and they get like, ah!
[53:17.10]I know, hold on, I'll be right there!
[53:21.32]Hey, hey, hey, thanks a lot to the crew!
[53:25.02]I'm coming!
[53:58.12]Thank you.
[57:17.74]Thank you.
[57:19.94]Eventually I will get a car, I promise.
[57:22.35]One day, I don't know when.
[57:26.29]Thanks for the ride.
[57:35.62]Oh shit, I hit somebody.
[57:38.60]Oh my God, I actually hit somebody with the fucking javelin.
[57:42.10]You alright?
[57:42.58]I mean, I threw it as hard as I could.
[57:45.82]I didn't know you could be that far away.
[57:48.29]Is he alright?
[57:50.65]Is he okay?
[57:52.25]Somebody, it's, I see a lot of blood coming out of here.
[57:54.86]It's like, it's profusely.
[57:56.52]But before we get medical on him.
[57:58.84]Are you sure we can, is it alright?
[58:00.08]Is he okay?
[58:01.78]Okay.
[58:03.70]Why would you stand in the way?
[58:04.78]I mean, I knew I had a good arm, but I mean, you know, but I'm cheap, you know what I mean?
[58:13.33]That's a classic fucking comedy joke.
[58:16.67]Alright.
[58:18.52]That was a good day at work.
[58:20.53]I am kind of gross.
[58:23.09]I mean, look, I've got a pool back here.
[58:27.77]I don't even need your choice.
[58:29.11]I want to go in the pool.
[58:32.01]Look, we got it out here.
[58:33.11]I'm going to use it.
[58:36.68]It's been a long day at work.
[58:39.04]I'm going to get in the pool.
[58:42.78]Just turn it off.
[58:43.36]Otherwise, I fucking won't stop touching it.
[58:49.11]Okay.
[58:51.77]I can wear the same clothes.
[58:52.75]It doesn't matter.
[58:53.39]A little cold.
[58:58.20]Cold.
[59:00.00]What's the thing?
[59:00.44]You just got to go right in?
[59:02.50]Okay.
[59:02.70]I'm just going in.
[59:10.53]That feels good.
[59:22.43]Would a Bugleberry do one of these?
[59:23.39]I think so.
[59:31.64]Hey there.
[59:35.58]That feels good.
[59:40.86]You know, something about cold water that just really gets into your head, it opens up your blood vessels, or closes them, I don't know.
[59:49.25]Either one of those two things, it does one of them.
[59:58.78]Alright.
[60:09.96]What?
[60:30.44]What?
[60:31.64]What?
[60:33.38]What happened?
[60:35.74]It felt like I was still alive, but something happened there.
[60:37.56]I feel like that was a long day at work.
[60:45.98]That was really weird.
[60:46.98]I kind of like just, it felt like I stopped my head.
[60:51.25]It was like a split second.
[60:52.41]My head felt like it was, like my head froze, but it was only like for a second.
[60:59.73]I don't know.
[61:02.30]Where's the ladder?
[61:05.70]What?
[61:08.46]I'm actually having fun, though.
[61:09.44]I'm having a fun time.
[61:10.34]What happened to the ladder?
[61:14.20]Where's the ladder?
[61:23.75]Where's the ladder?
[61:25.25]I have to get out of the pool.
[61:28.35]I don't want to be in here all day.
[61:29.77]I've got shit to do.
[61:33.01]Help, somebody help me!
[61:34.91]Somebody help me!
[61:35.55]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, come here, come here, come here, help, help, help, help, help!
[61:43.13]Get in the pool, get in the pool!
[61:45.25]That's a police officer.
[61:46.31]Get in the pool and help me, get in the pool!
[61:49.09]Get in the pool, there's someone in the pool that needs help.
[61:53.55]I think they took the ladder over there.
[61:56.43]Fucking idiot, AI piece of shit.
[61:59.31]Hey!
[62:02.18]Hey, don't eat anything!
[62:10.70]Don't eat anything!
[62:12.86]What's he doing?
[62:13.58]He's in my bathroom!
[62:16.64]No, stop drinking beer!
[62:18.06]I can tell!
[62:18.86]That's all people do in my house is drink beer out of the fridge!
[62:23.85]Put the ladder back, put the ladder back.
[62:24.97]You can put the ladder back if you want.
[62:27.49]You should put the ladder back.
[62:31.29]I want to get out of the pool.
[62:32.72]I want to get out of the pool.
[62:35.78]I want to get out of the pool.
[62:51.57]Put the ladder back on.
[63:16.54]Oh, hello there.
[63:19.30]Well, well, well.
[63:22.86]Has someone gone for a little swim without his floaties?
[63:30.01]It's me, your old friend Death, who puts the fun in funeral.
[63:35.83]Come on now.
[63:44.45]It's time.
[63:47.21]Oh, yes.
[63:49.43]It's time for the midnight train to the long farewell.
[63:53.19]No, no, what?
[63:54.75]Yes, oh, yes.
[63:56.17]You killed me.
[63:57.37]Why didn't you check the ladder out?
[63:58.57]That's a, oh, it's so, it's a funny joke, isn't it?
[64:02.09]Until it's dead.
[64:03.67]Are you blaming someone else when you decided to get in without a life jacket?
[64:11.19]You're right.
[64:13.50]Okay, am I dead?
[64:15.28]Am I dead now?
[64:16.66]Oh, you're very, very dead.
[64:19.10]Oh, wait a minute.
[64:19.74]I could have just gone like this.
[64:24.15]Oh.
[64:25.61]Oh, right.
[64:26.89]Unfortunately, no givesies backsies.
[64:34.21]Have you made all of your preparations?
[64:36.45]I have, and I just... You look wonderful today.
[64:43.35]Can I just tell you that?
[64:45.31]The scythe, the uniform, something about the way, the mysterious, the dark, mysterious stranger.
[64:52.98]You know, usually when people flirt with death, it's something simpler like blowfish sushi.
[64:57.38]Right.
[64:58.44]This is a bit complicated.
[64:59.98]Are you, do you mean it when you say that?
[65:03.90]Or are you saying that because you saw me?
[65:06.56]I mean, I mean it.
[65:07.14]I do.
[65:09.00]I think that I, would you like to come inside, maybe?
[65:12.66]Do we have to go immediately?
[65:13.88]Or can we have a drink?
[65:14.88]Can we hang out?
[65:16.22]This is kind of uncon... Listen, I have a hot dog eating contest and I've got three souls to take in about 20 minutes.
[65:23.25]Okay.
[65:23.59]Okay, it's unconventional, but this once, I'll allow it.
[65:27.27]Okay, great.
[65:28.69]Come on in.
[65:30.21]I feel... Is that normal?
[65:31.69]Should I be doing that?
[65:32.55]That is normal.
[65:36.70]Usually it's a bit more crying, screaming.
[65:41.66]I've been crying, it feels like, for fucking three days, Dad.
[65:44.98]That's alright.
[65:46.18]Time to see your Uncle Ted.
[65:48.14]Isn't that fun after all?
[65:50.88]I didn't even know that.
[65:52.00]I thought he was dead like a year.
[65:53.48]I've already got a spot picked out for you.
[65:56.94]Okay.
[65:57.92]Well, I do, I really do think you're a very, very, very handsome, Death.
[66:01.90]Oh, stop.
[66:03.88]Stop, you don't mean that.
[66:05.48]I do.

[66:09.48]Come on in here.
[66:13.64]Why is he in here?

[72:10.22]Who is that?
[72:11.28]That's just a bunch of pillows.
[72:13.90]That's just a bunch of pillows?
[72:15.28]Yeah, look, it's just pillows, like black pillows.
[72:16.95]It's a collection of moving sentient pillows.
[72:19.77]No, it's nobody.
[72:20.99]This is a standing pillow now.
[72:23.25]No, that's... Am I meant to believe, because I'm a stupid maid, that this is a sentient pillow that stands?
[72:27.41]No, no, God.
[72:27.87]No, no, no, no.
[72:28.99]Of course not.
[72:29.41]Stay away from me.
[72:30.31]Oh, he's got a side.
[72:31.11]Dad, what do you do about that?
[72:31.99]He's got a side.
[72:32.43]Uh-oh.
[72:33.03]He's got your thigh.
[72:34.09]Why did you stand me up on our date and now this?
[72:38.08]Look, you have no idea.
[72:39.12]My life has been an absolute train wreck.
[72:40.80]People come to the house, organ players.
[72:42.52]I've had like police here three times.
[72:44.00]A police officer was here like an hour ago just drinking on my couch.
[72:46.83]This sounds really tough for you that someone was drinking on your couch.
[72:50.66]No, you don't understand.
[72:51.58]It wasn't even my decision.
[72:53.14]It was easy for me to get stood up, and I can't believe this.
[72:56.22]You can take this, and you can take him, you shitter.
[72:59.78]No, no.
[73:00.50]I hope it was nice.
[73:01.14]Amelia, just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[73:03.55]No.
[73:04.63]You missed your chance.
[73:06.51]You don't know how high I can fly.
[73:17.73]Listen, this has been great.
[73:20.72]It's just a little tense for me.
[73:22.36]I've got that hot dog eating contest.
[73:24.22]Listen, I'm just gonna go.
[73:26.46]You don't call me.

[73:31.12]Wish I could talk.
[73:32.70]Have to go.
[73:33.20]So nice.
[73:34.92]I actually don't want you to call me.
[73:36.12]I want you to lose my number because I don't want to hear from you because that means a bad thing.
[73:38.65]Oh, don't worry.
[73:39.73]I'll come calling.
[73:40.97]You just won't know when.
[73:42.05]Oh, Jesus.
[73:45.27]Um...
[73:47.46]I got my life back.
[73:49.44]I feel like... I feel like I've had a big life, but I gotta... Hold on.
[73:55.89]I need to... Amelia, God damn it.
[73:58.69]I didn't want to stand anybody up.
[74:00.77]It's not even my decision if I stand somebody up or not.
[74:03.05]Did you understand?
[74:07.13]It's not my choice if somebody's... Amelia!
[74:13.84]Amelia!
[74:15.74]Just wait!
[74:16.38]I...
[74:18.06]Amelia, hold on.
[74:18.62]It takes 30 seconds to come down the stairs.
[74:23.90]Amelia!
[74:26.34]No, no.
[74:30.74]Amelia!
[74:31.38]Oh, crap.
[74:34.78]Oh, crap.
[74:40.31]Amelia!
[74:41.31]Oh, that was a voice crack, and it was bad.
[74:42.95]That was the worst one I've ever done.
[74:53.44]What a disaster.
[75:00.01]What a day.
[75:00.39]Oh, right, I turned it off, right.
[75:08.17]That's not, I didn't want that to happen.
[75:13.32]Ugh.
[75:27.61]What a wild day.
[75:30.11]Well, here's something for you guys.
[75:34.55]If you kill me, you need to be ready for the consequences.
[75:59.38]Catch butterflies!
[76:00.30]I don't even know why I threw it at somebody.
[76:02.60]Is he alright?
[76:03.08]Can I get it from, can I get it from his?
[76:05.36]Let me get, let me get, can you give me the thing that I threw at the crew member?
[76:09.70]Yeah, just toss it over here.
[76:11.15]Yeah, thank you, there it is.
[76:12.75]Thanks, appreciate it.
[76:15.67]Catch butterflies.
[76:16.39]Don't fall in the pool, I can't get out of there.
[76:35.15]Did I get any?
[76:35.69]I don't even know.
[76:36.33]I don't like everything.
[76:37.07]I don't know what they look like.
[76:44.99]I'm so tired.
[76:46.19]Please send me to bed.
[76:57.48]It's so far away.
[76:59.78]It's so far away.
[77:01.84]It's so far away.
[77:02.64]Why do I have such a big house?
[77:05.07]It's too far away.
[77:05.85]It's too far away.
[77:14.21]I can get there.
[77:15.07]I can get there.
[77:22.42]Let's go upstairs.

[85:57.62]There's this like deep purple blood here.
[86:08.36]What is that?
[86:11.00]Why is it like purple blood?
[86:19.58]Ow.

[86:40.93]I don't even want it.
[86:42.33]I'm gonna... I don't want it!
[86:46.76]You can decide for yourself if you want to go to GermanIA5.com and get merchandise, especially, specifically for this show.
[87:01.43]I feel awful.
[87:02.27]I just feel like today sucks.
[87:10.01]Oh!

[87:28.20]Oh.
[87:29.50]And it's my ladybug friend from the first, from two weeks ago.

[87:42.68]I actually love them.
[87:43.92]And wait, is this one of those things that can go like this?

[88:01.71]They're fantastic.
[88:03.79]Oh, they're so cool.
[88:06.61]They're gonna go in my bed.
[88:09.45]They're gonna go in my bed.
[88:11.63]In my bed.
[88:12.35]I don't wanna go too far.
[88:16.19]Wait, this one, wait, look at this.
[88:21.27]It's a magic trick for you.
[88:42.71]I'm starting to feel that up here in the throat.
[88:44.24]I have to pee so bad.
[88:54.55]I'm going paint with or without the robe.
[88:58.62]I'm just tell... Look, I'm just saying.
[89:04.16]I'm just saying.
[89:06.50]Hot dog.
[89:09.86]I'm just saying.
[89:16.60]Fine.
[89:18.10]If it allows me to go to the bathroom, I'll put it on.
[89:20.91]Hold on, let me go down the stairs.
[89:27.39]I'll put it on.
[89:27.83]It'll be on by the time you see me next, I promise.
[89:36.05]Put the robe on.
[89:37.45]Get heat stroke.
[89:40.23]We want robe or no bathroom.
[89:44.80]Wrong door.
[89:49.76]Hey, this is the one I'm supposed to go in.
[90:12.16]Who is calling me?
[90:15.30]Who is calling my phone?
[90:17.45]Oh, wait, I have to... Hello?
[90:29.54]Hey, this is Jason again calling from Dealer Warranty Services Licensed Representatives of Car Extended Vehicle Purchase Points LLC calling.
[90:40.29]Looks like you've been dodging a couple of my phone calls.
[90:43.17]We sent you a bunch of things in the mail.
[90:45.75]a couple emails, a couple fax machines, even got your grandma in on the thing, but for some reason you just don't seem to want to get back to me about your vehicle's extended warranty.
[90:57.30]Are you trying to drive on safety?
[91:01.22]Do you want your car to explode?
[91:04.26]At this point, I'm starting to be a little concerned.
[91:08.32]That's enough of that.
[91:11.36]You know,
[91:13.04]phone calls are starting to become like email.
[91:16.50]Have you noticed that?
[91:17.06]When was the last time you answered the telephone if mom wasn't the contact that came up?
[91:25.73]I have not answered my actual cell phone unless MOM is on the goddamn fucking thing.
[91:33.43]It's becoming spam email now.
[91:35.73]Nobody answers their phone, nobody checks their email.
[91:38.10]How do we communicate with anybody?
[91:53.59]I wasn't... Hold on.
[92:04.68]Hold on a second.
[92:08.94]Gonna need a little more than that.
[92:10.53]I'm gonna need a little bit more than that.
[92:12.51]I'm gonna need a little bit more than that.
[92:16.57]Yup!
[92:37.46]Yes.
[92:44.47]Oh.
[92:47.95]Shut up!
[92:49.67]My voice is fucked.
[92:52.24]This is from screaming for three straight days.
[92:55.28]Shut up!
[93:11.43]Get those bars up.
[93:14.09]Otherwise, I'm going to be in trouble.
[93:18.39]Oh, hey, glasses.
[93:20.43]Reddit.
[93:21.35]10,000.
[93:21.47]Upload.
[93:36.06]And you know the pose we're doing.
[93:39.16]Told you.
[93:41.97]I told you.
[93:43.88]I'm hungry, very hungry.
[93:48.94]Exceptional.
[93:49.62]I gotta clean this up.
[93:51.00]What happened here?
[93:55.50]Look at this.
[93:56.76]What a mess.
[94:00.14]This looks awesome.
[94:01.74]Awesome?
[94:02.20]It looks awful.
[94:05.08]Make food, but I have to have the robe on to make food.
[94:10.39]Well, can't we just say who cares and I can just do whatever I want?
[94:14.27]Can I break away from their control at some point?
[94:17.29]Okay.
[94:21.20]Sure, put the robe on.
[94:33.68]This is so hot with this on.
[94:36.76]Can I go like this?
[94:44.04]It's snuggie.
[94:46.74]Oh, my mic, I gotta be, hold on, I'll go like this.
[94:54.22]I feel like this is like a fashion trend right now, right?
[94:57.46]Is it like a dress that people wear that looks like this?
[95:00.75]With like a talter top and it's like this?
[95:03.95]Right?
[95:04.13]Don't you think that'd be huge?
[95:05.37]And it's like goes into a dress?
[95:08.82]I THINK I FOUND... LOOK, IF YOU'RE A DESIGNER AND YOU MAKE THIS, I WANT 10%.
[95:14.72]IT GOES AROUND ALL THE WAY BACK, YEAH.
[95:17.83]ALRIGHT, FOOD.
[95:22.39]MAKING FOOD IS JUST ANNOYING, AND I'M NOT DOING IT.
[95:24.51]IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS.
[95:25.05]SO WE'RE JUST EATING A COOKIE.
[95:44.74]Uh, not until I... I'm not dealing with this shit till I eat.
[95:54.04]Open the door.
[96:00.51]Present!
[96:01.43]What the fucking thing happened?
[96:05.49]What?
[96:06.27]We're here on behalf of the king.
[96:09.03]Um, what king?
[96:15.00]As you are new to these lands, you must read the scroll.
[96:19.82]I need to read a scroll?
[96:22.66]We expect you to pledge fealty to the king.
[96:27.17]If not, there will be dire consequences.
[96:29.95]I don't know what drugs are going around this neighborhood, but it's something hard.
[96:33.41]Pledge it, fealty it, or you'll be severed.
[96:37.75]So you're going to kill me if I don't pledge fealty.
[96:40.07]What's fealty?
[96:40.87]Fledge fealty to the king for 500 shillings.
[96:44.41]500 shillings.
[96:45.31]Is that money?
[96:46.13]I have a really tough time right now.
[96:51.22]My daughter, my youngest kin, Agatha, she needs braces.
[96:55.79]We don't have health insurance.
[96:56.83]Can't do that.
[96:57.59]Say that one more time.
[96:59.48]My daughter needs braces.
[97:00.60]I've been on this job for a fucking month, dude.
[97:02.44]Okay.
[97:03.10]You know, it's my fourth appointment.
[97:04.26]I'm going to cut you a break.
[97:05.84]Who sent you here, though?
[97:06.78]Like, is it like a joke or something?
[97:07.88]No, I'm here in Baton Rouge, King.
[97:09.34]And the thing is, if you don't pay, I get to serve your head.
[97:11.47]I don't know if you've ever used one of these.
[97:12.79]It's kind of dull.
[97:13.29]It takes a little bit of time.
[97:14.15]That hurt, actually.
[97:14.85]I've done three today.
[97:15.55]I'm fucking tired, bro.
[97:16.63]Just pay me like 500 shillings.
[97:17.99]That's like, you know, 2021 Jerma bucks.
[97:19.85]You look like shit.
[97:20.59]You're not even that big.
[97:22.92]I can literally cut your fucking head off right now, and I don't want to.
[97:25.09]My arm's exhausted.
[97:25.93]I've got a torn rotator cuff.
[97:27.51]I know, but you look like shit, and I could probably beat you up.
[97:29.81]I could probably punch you in the face and kill you.
[97:31.85]Loser.
[97:32.43]Loser.
[97:33.13]That poked me in the eye.
[97:33.89]You must be really going to do this.
[97:36.32]Can you just cut me a fucking head?
[97:37.58]How much money do you need?
[97:39.08]I told you it's five hundred shillings.
[97:41.22]Who is this guy?
[97:43.32]Don't worry about that.
[97:43.90]It's none of your concern.
[97:44.65]Are you going to pay or not?
[97:49.80]Look, if you want 500 bucks from me, then I'm going to have to hear a goddamn song from this motherfucker right here.
[97:58.04]You want 500?
[97:58.38]You're not in a position to decide if who playeth the fluteth.
[98:07.53]I want to hear a song, don't everybody else?
[98:17.38]My music sucks.
[98:18.86]You both suck.
[98:19.48]You're both idiots.
[98:21.20]You both, you both, you both like probably, you probably both stupid.
[98:23.77]You probably fucking have a 30 IQ.
[98:25.19]Very well.
[98:26.07]Alright.
[98:26.29]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[98:28.87]I was told to do that.
[98:30.15]Somebody said do that.
[98:31.19]Who?
[98:31.51]There's no one here.
[98:32.31]Yes, there is.
[98:32.89]They're up in the sky.
[98:33.75]I see if no one is.
[98:35.06]Play it.
[98:35.30]Just tell it to play again.
[98:36.44]Okay.
[98:37.08]500.
[98:39.96]We'll 500 get you to leave.
[98:43.44]Okay, get some music.
[98:44.76]Get some music before I look like an idiot.
[98:47.20]Is it decided?
[98:49.26]Yes, take 500 and leave if you get 500 bucks.
[98:51.88]Then we're an alliance.
[98:55.58]We're an alliance?
[98:56.70]You're not gonna hurt me, are you?
[98:57.68]I want to cut your head off, so I really appreciate it.
[98:59.82]Let's celebrate.
[99:00.84]Yeah, let's celebrate.
[99:01.66]What are you doing?
[99:04.80]You're not... You can't just take beers out of the fridge.
[99:07.66]What is it?
[99:09.21]This neighborhood, I swear to God, everybody is on fucking hard drugs.
[99:13.95]What are you doing?
[99:14.43]A toast to the king!
[99:17.67]No, uh... Okay.
[99:26.06]There's nothing... There's nothing left in here.
[99:27.96]This time next year.
[99:29.16]Yes, this time next year.
[99:30.42]Watch the phone.
[99:35.28]There's nothing left in here, drag it all.
[99:38.46]This is the guy that comes in.
[99:39.74]He's the guy that comes in and drinks a beer really fast.
[99:50.84]That's his thing that he does.
[99:53.06]Hey, do you know a guy that can drink beer real fast?
[99:56.28]Uh, yeah.
[99:58.96]Yeah, I know a guy that can drink beer real fast.
[100:05.35]This thing is gross.
[100:06.55]I'm putting this in the sink.
[100:08.43]And you left my door open.
[100:09.93]Pledge fealty to the king.
[100:11.55]Well, I hope your daughter got the braces.
[100:13.93]Unbelievable.
[100:16.45]They have a cop here.
[100:17.17]I think the cop is on drugs, too.
[100:19.97]Literally, nobody here is, like, nobody here is sober, okay?
[100:23.65]This is, like, a bunch of, like, people doing drugs.
[100:27.31]I'm the only sober one in this whole neighborhood.
[100:30.71]But that's not actually accurate, because I've had, like, three of those.
[100:35.45]Can I get the bread off the ground at least?
[100:38.79]King Arthur, what is he doing here?
[100:41.59]Why is he, like, a flute player?
[100:51.72]Do you know a guy that can drink beer real fast?
[100:55.80]What is this?
[100:56.30]Oh, they left it.
[101:00.74]I'm watching some TV.
[101:02.93]I'm going to put the tube on.

[121:05.65]Let's find out.
[121:11.13]Channel on.
[121:12.29]And good afternoon, residents of Dollhouse.
[121:15.09]We have an emergency announcement.
[121:17.01]There has been a gorilla reported on the loose.
[121:19.25]After speaking with the gorilla, we did get some information about the motive of his escape.
[121:24.58]After dispute with his mother about not liking his girlfriend,
[121:28.92]He has decided to escape his enclosure.
[121:32.64]Here we have Randy, our specialist in the area on gorillas and bears.
[121:37.25]Randy, do you have any advice to offer citizens if they encounter this gorilla?
[121:41.07]Well, first thing you have to remember is you're dealing with a wild animal.
[121:44.39]You're dealing with heartache.
[121:45.73]So first thing you need to do is make sure that if you are going to approach these animals, make sure you take somebody slower than you.
[121:53.00]because you want to be able to outrun them in case you get attacked by that animal.
[121:57.54]Second of all, don't forget to play dead because then you'll know what it's like when they kill you.
[122:03.68]And then I would advise against pepper spray.
[122:06.82]Bears love the taste of pepper on human flesh.
[122:10.21]I would suggest rubbing your body with steamed broccoli before going out after these animals.
[122:15.33]Wonderful.
[122:15.79]Thank you so much, Randy.
[122:17.47]Is there anything else you would like to say?
[122:18.87]Did you get any more information behind the motive from this gorilla?
[122:22.74]No, really.
[122:23.50]Just the whole conversation was, it was just bananas, really.
[122:26.36]And it's just crazy.
[122:27.88]I'm not quite sure what we're going to do.
[122:29.79]That was fantastic.
[122:30.85]That was a great segue.
[122:32.55]TV has been turned off.
[122:37.09]A gorilla on the loose.
[122:38.24]Okay.
[122:41.84]I don't have broccoli.
[122:43.22]I don't have whatever else it was.
[123:04.87]Yeah, really?
[123:08.26]Right after the segment on television?
[123:12.30]Oh man.
[123:14.75]I want to move.
[123:15.97]I want to move.
[123:16.73]I don't want to live here anymore.
[123:18.45]Why does it feel like everything is coming to get me?
[123:20.59]And there are my glasses.
[123:23.17]That was loud.
[123:24.15]There's my glasses.
[123:27.11]Everybody's trying to kill me in this town.
[123:30.48]How could you possibly live here for more than a week?
[123:34.32]What the fuck?
[123:36.74]I'm not going out there.
[123:38.10]You saw what happened last time.
[123:39.72]I'm not going out there again to get attacked.
[123:46.71]I'M GONNA CALL A BEAR.
[123:48.93]CALL A BEAR?
[123:49.89]WHAT DO YOU... WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN, CALL BEAR?
[123:53.77]CALL BEAR?
[123:54.55]I DON'T HAVE A BEAR'S PHONE NUMBER, DO I?
[123:56.57]I GUESS I DO.
[123:57.60]MY HAND IS DOING IT.
[124:01.52]HELLO?
[124:03.58]HELLO, YES, I'D LIKE TO CALL THE BEAR, A BEAR SERVICE TO COME ATTACK TO HELP ME, I GUESS.
[124:11.23]THIS IS A REAL SERVICE?
[124:13.51]OKAY, THANK YOU.
[124:14.23]HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
[124:16.49]That's too much money, but... Alright.
[124:19.21]God damn it.
[124:19.91]Send him.
[124:20.23]Send him in.
[124:25.51]What the fuck?
[124:30.44]Hey, hey.
[124:33.38]There's a gorilla in my yard.
[124:35.00]There's a gorilla in my... Shit.
[124:53.76]Did somebody just say red rum?
[125:00.15]Are we alright?
[125:13.81]Oh, that's quite a mess out here.
[125:18.82]Nobody here.
[125:19.40]Okay.
[125:21.16]How much does that cost?
[125:21.92]A bear service?
[125:24.20]That was the bear that was here before, but he was friendly this time.
[125:26.62]What does that cost?
[125:30.14]The maid's going to have to... I know Amelia.
[125:32.18]Amelia, I'm still paying for your service, so that doesn't mean you don't come anymore.
[125:35.10]$250 for the bear?
[125:41.06]Was it $2,500 or $250?
[125:52.58]I was going to say, that's pretty cheap if it was $2,500.
[125:56.38]Good thing it was an extra zero.
[126:06.61]Get this back over here, where it belongs, please.
[126:23.67]This sucks.
[126:25.59]This actually sucks.
[126:30.14]It sucks living here.
[126:37.32]I fucking hate living here.
[126:38.78]I actually don't like being here.
[126:40.28]I mean, it's a nice house, but what is this neighborhood?
[126:47.52]Bears, gorillas, people that aren't drugs just attacking you.
[126:52.25]We're like church groups that come into your house and just don't even knock.
[126:55.71]The police just sit on your couch and drink sodas and stuff.
[126:58.57]People drink beer out of my fridge.
[127:07.15]What a mess.
[127:13.15]Not today, not today, tomorrow.
[127:27.19]tomorrow but tomorrow why why can't you just do tomorrow showed up like this I'm gonna look like I'm gonna be happy about it hello I'm going to work fine just wait I'm coming
[127:49.68]That looks like a full car today.
[127:50.86]Do I have to sit in the middle?
[127:52.40]No, I don't want to sit in the middle.
[127:54.08]Fine, just move.
[132:18.51]Thank you.
[132:54.02]Yeah, that was a long day.
[132:55.84]This is because I sit in the middle because I'm the smallest one.
[133:00.12]I know I always put it up for grabs and I always say I'll do it, but that doesn't mean I want to.
[133:04.50]Maybe like next time I can get in the front, like just once.
[133:08.24]Just one time I sit in the front seat.
[133:09.82]Sitting in the middle sucks.
[133:12.60]I know I'm like the smallest guy, but whatever, whatever, whatever works.
[133:15.31]Thank you.
[133:16.41]See you on Saturday.
[133:18.29]If you get a fucking invite.
[133:24.28]Was that like a fun beep or was that like a you're mad beep?
[133:27.06]I can't tell.
[133:27.88]You do that all the time.
[133:29.18]You do that like every day.

[139:47.90]How long, what, somebody look this up.
[139:50.50]When do you die?
[139:52.08]At what point after eating just pecan sandies?
[139:56.98]I'm gonna make my bed.
[140:03.90]It's just like sugar, bread, and like flour.
[140:07.27]Can you live off of flour?
[140:10.49]I think you can live off of flour for at least a week.
[140:12.07]I hope so.
[140:15.36]Sorry, I take a multivitamin, you just don't see it.
[140:25.23]You want one of these?
[140:27.81]You want one of these?
[140:30.13]You want one of these?
[140:32.27]Too bad, they're sold out.
[140:36.23]I actually think they are.
[140:38.40]Jerma985.com!
[140:43.12]Make the bed.
[140:46.04]Hi.
[140:46.98]Hi.
[140:47.22]We were just doing a little... In my bedroom.
[140:51.90]Workout.
[140:52.56]Well, I mean, you know, you left your front door unlocked, so we were just... I have a very, very important quick question.
[140:59.88]Yes.
[141:00.56]Do you both have a house?
[141:03.68]I have a condo.
[141:04.60]It's my mom's condo.
[141:05.86]It's just a temporary thing.
[141:07.22]I'm just saving money.
[141:08.07]How much room is in the condo?
[141:10.07]It's a one bedroom.
[141:11.01]Okay.
[141:11.49]Small.
[141:12.43]About the size of a phone booth.
[141:14.13]Do you have a house?
[141:15.85]Condo?
[141:16.93]Rent?
[141:17.21]Anything?
[141:17.93]Rental?
[141:19.35]Gladys, I think it might be time.
[141:21.34]I'm feeling a little overheated.
[141:22.26]How long have you been in here?
[141:24.30]You know, it's... I never really time my workouts.
[141:27.42]When my body says it's done, I know it's done.
[141:30.98]But you have to do it in somebody's bedroom in the neighborhood.
[141:34.92]Wherever there's free space, we figured you're new to the neighborhood.
[141:38.33]We can get you into the... Remember the 60-mile run?
[141:41.47]Remember where we were going to...
[141:42.98]Well, I don't want you to leave.
[141:44.68]Oh.
[141:45.52]I don't want you to leave.
[141:46.35]In fact, I want you to fucking show me some workouts.
[141:49.37]You'd like to do some workouts?
[141:50.29]I would love to do some workouts.
[141:51.61]Well, someone's had a change of attitude.
[141:54.21]Okay.
[141:54.61]This is a nice shirt, too.
[141:55.71]Oh, you like that?
[141:56.28]What did you say, sweating?
[141:57.06]Sweating.
[141:58.20]You know why?
[141:58.64]Because the secret's in the sweat.
[142:00.62]And I think that is very sexy, if I can be honest with you.
[142:03.54]Oh, well, that's... That is sexy and awesome, and I'm very much into it.
[142:08.87]Oh, well, it's a little forward, but... I think you're wonderful.
[142:13.69]Listen, someone's got a silver tongue.
[142:15.67]Okay, so here's the first exercise.
[142:17.09]Gladys, try to keep up this time, okay?
[142:19.75]It's perfect.
[142:20.71]Hands up.
[142:21.67]We've got spirit fingers.
[142:22.79]Okay.
[142:23.17]Spirit fingers.
[142:23.96]I'm really tired, so we're going to do something light.
[142:25.90]Okay.
[142:26.40]Something light.
[142:26.92]Okay.
[142:27.76]We're screwing in the light bulbs.
[142:29.52]We're screwing in the light bulbs.
[142:31.66]We're screwing in.
[142:32.58]We're screwing in.
[142:33.46]We're screwing in the light bulbs.
[142:34.76]I find you very, very, very handsome and attractive.
[142:36.71]That's not part of the workout, but that's just going to pretend that that just didn't happen, okay?
[142:42.29]So now what we're doing is we're going to do the sprinkler, okay?
[142:44.69]Follow me.
[142:45.05]It goes... I don't want to do the sprinkler.
[142:47.27]Shh, shh, shh.
[142:48.72]Hey.
[142:50.02]Hey.
[142:50.96]I want to hear a better hey.
[142:53.22]Hey.
[142:54.52]Hey.
[142:55.04]Yeah, that's a bit better.
[142:56.40]That's a bit better.
[142:57.92]Oh, like that game Dark Souls.
[143:00.74]Game Dark Souls?
[143:02.10]We'll do it again.
[143:02.60]Okay.
[143:02.76]Alright, here's the next one, okay?
[143:04.54]Yep.
[143:05.22]There's something stuck in the fax machine.
[143:08.70]There's something stuck in the fax machine.
[143:12.06]Oh, there's something stuck in the fax machine.
[143:15.44]Get out of there.
[143:15.94]There's something stuck in the fax machine.
[143:25.00]You alright?
[143:25.76]You gonna be okay?
[143:28.37]Screw you, Dad!
[143:31.91]Hey, would you look at the time?
[143:34.44]I think it's bedtime.
[143:35.38]I think it's time for me to go to bed right now.
[143:37.12]Okay.
[143:38.34]Come on, Gladys.
[144:13.24]Thank you.
[145:28.24]Thank you.
[152:24.53]Oh, I heard something last night.
[152:31.19]Oh, that was a very weird dream.
[152:36.45]Oh, it's Otto.
[152:40.63]Wait, hold on.
[152:50.93]There was an explosion last night.
[152:54.66]It sounded like a bomb went off.
[152:58.30]I don't know what it was.
[152:59.28]I mean, something just followed me through here.
[153:10.17]It smelled.
[153:15.11]What was that?
[153:15.57]Is it a gas line?
[153:21.49]Holy shit.
[153:24.62]That's not me, is it?
[153:30.35]Oh my god, I think it is.
[153:38.39]You want one of these?
[153:38.91]It's sold out.
[153:42.46]What is this?
[153:45.08]Oh, cabinets!
[153:56.55]STOOLS IN HERE.
[153:58.87]AND I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW THIS BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO.
[154:04.93]I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW IT BECAUSE I KNOW THE AUDIO GUY.
[154:08.32]I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO.
[154:10.30]IN FACT, AUDIO GUY, I DON'T
[154:27.86]Oh, there's a poop emoji in there.
[154:30.08]Okay, what else is in here?
[154:31.20]Oh, look.
[154:37.89]What?
[154:38.39]These are so heavy.
[154:39.47]Oh.
[154:41.75]Oh, look, another stool.
[154:45.57]Wow.
[154:47.06]We had a lot of these.
[154:51.16]And a smiley balloon.
[154:57.09]I kind of don't... Oh, that's sad.
[155:00.28]That's really sad.
[155:04.96]Nice cabinets.
[155:06.80]What a waste of money.
[155:08.46]You could have bought literally anything else.
[155:12.77]What am I doing?
[155:19.43]Decorate?
[155:21.41]Decorate this room?
[155:30.08]Remember, Jerma985.com if you want some merchandise from this stream.
[155:34.24]It's all sold out, but who cares?
[155:35.30]Let's see if we can get this open.
[155:49.35]A decorate?
[155:51.62]It's probably actually a pretty good time to do this, Rum.
[155:54.08]I think so.
[155:55.42]We'll do this.
[155:57.70]Uh...
[156:01.16]I don't like this being open.
[156:02.76]I don't like that.
[156:04.80]I don't like that one.
[156:06.08]I like this one.
[156:08.27]I like that being open.
[156:10.49]I want it open.
[156:13.05]This fell.
[156:17.33]Get this out of the way.
[156:20.79]This is the DIY room.
[156:22.21]And if you don't know what a DIY room, it's do it yourself.
[156:28.35]So we're gonna be, you and I, of course, gonna be painting these rooms, maybe.
[156:34.55]Pick a good color, I hope you do.
[156:38.01]Hey, wanna see something crazy?
[156:40.85]I command this to go into the bathroom!
[156:49.29]Did it go into the bathroom?
[156:52.55]It did.
[156:53.46]I have magical powers!
[156:57.49]Alright, let's move this.
[157:00.47]Get this out of the way.
[157:01.23]This is so fucking heavy.
[157:08.27]What a waste of fucking money.
[157:18.47]Okay.
[157:19.77]That's not going to work.
[157:21.45]That's not going to work.
[157:26.97]Nothing else is going to break.
[157:29.99]What do you have back here for me?
[157:32.26]What do you have?
[157:33.58]What the fuck?
[157:38.56]What?
[157:39.04]I can't even move these.
[157:40.20]They're like in ten pieces.
[157:45.46]Okay.
[157:48.83]I don't... Get all this out of the way.
[157:54.07]Out of the way, out, out.
[158:08.12]Get this out of the way.
[158:14.26]Open the door so I can see what I'm doing.
[158:17.90]Okay, good.
[158:19.22]Alright, what do I wanna do?
[158:24.01]Number one thing I want to do in the DIY room, I think we take out one of these walls.
[158:31.71]Yep, this is a sledgehammer.
[158:36.21]What do we got here?
[158:36.95]Alright, this is good.
[158:39.94]This is saw.
[158:41.82]I'm thinking right here.
[158:43.00]I think so.
[158:44.40]What do you think?
[158:45.66]Right against the wall?
[158:48.12]I think so.
[158:51.70]Right there.
[158:52.85]I want an open bedroom concept for my VR room.
[158:55.49]Can't really.
[158:58.71]What happened?
[159:16.38]What?
[159:18.60]Why does it not work?
[159:21.02]It's plugged in.
[159:21.68]What the fuck?
[159:23.87]The saw's not working anymore.
[159:33.58]I think there's an electrical problem.
[159:35.06]The saw doesn't work.
[159:36.98]The saw doesn't work.
[159:39.34]Oh, shit.
[159:42.68]That scared the shit out of me.
[159:45.40]I can't get the saw to work.
[159:47.30]I'll try to figure it out.
[159:48.12]Let me see if I can get this to work somehow.
[159:55.19]LEAD TO THE FUSE BOX PROBABLY.
[159:56.27]THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT'S GOING ON.
[160:03.07]WHERE DOES THIS GO?
[160:04.09]THIS GOES SOMEWHERE.
[160:05.97]IT'S TAPED DOWN OVER HERE, BUT HOLD ON.
[160:11.72]WHY WOULD IT STOP WORKING?
[160:13.04]I PLUGGED IT INTO THE BASE DOWNSTAIRS.
[160:16.34]I HAVE LIKE A WHOLE UNIT THAT'S DOWN THERE.
[160:18.28]THERE'S LIKE FOUR OR FIVE EXTENSION CORDS THAT GO OUT.
[160:24.30]What is going on?
[160:26.10]What is going on?
[160:29.64]What the heck is this?
[160:34.55]Who are you?
[160:35.76]I'm your neighbor.
[160:36.34]I'm Jebediah Abernathy.
[160:37.66]I live next door.
[160:39.38]Jebediah?
[160:40.08]What's your name?
[160:40.70]What are you doing with my electricity, huh?
[160:43.14]I plugged this in my unit downstairs.
[160:45.28]What are you talking about?
[160:46.28]No way.
[160:46.63]That thing's coming straight from my house.
[160:48.03]You can follow it down the street.
[160:50.03]Listen, when I grew up, that's called thievery.
[160:52.01]I don't know what you think that is.
[160:53.43]Well, I saw a place to plug it in, and I plugged it in.
[160:55.57]I didn't know if it was yours or not.
[160:56.93]You didn't check first.
[160:58.90]No, I mean, I just figured electricity plugs are just, I can just use them.
[161:01.64]What is this place?
[161:02.62]This is your plug?
[161:03.82]Yeah, it's my plug.
[161:05.04]That's okay.
[161:06.08]Which are you, 980, 982, what are you?
[161:10.62]Yeah, 980, 980.
[161:11.34]I live down past Edna.
[161:13.32]Oh, cool.
[161:13.80]Yeah, you met Ludwig?
[161:15.57]Yeah, it's crazy that this many people live here.
[161:18.83]It's weird.
[161:19.57]Dollhouse Lane.
[161:20.61]Listen, I'm going to need that back.
[161:24.39]I'm working on a project up here.
[161:26.97]Yeah, it looks like it.
[161:27.73]You have no clue what you're doing, do you?
[161:29.85]I don't really.
[161:31.91]That is not the right tool for the job.
[161:33.73]I got to tell you that.
[161:34.90]I'll tell you that much.
[161:35.68]That's not the right tool for the job.
[161:37.52]That's for sure.
[161:38.96]Okay.
[161:39.50]This is more confusing than a fart in a fan factory.
[161:43.12]Alright.
[161:43.46]Well, Jeb, excuse me, Jeb.
[161:46.48]Oh, Lord.
[161:47.71]Hey, listen, I'll tell you what.
[161:48.89]That's your electricity?
[161:50.97]Yeah, electricity.
[161:52.49]So I haven't been taking it from you, have I?
[161:55.55]I mean, we'll have to see.
[161:56.61]My bill has been exceptionally high.
[161:58.59]How high has your bill been?
[161:59.85]I mean, a couple extra hundred.
[162:01.41]A couple extra hundred.
[162:02.91]Per month?
[162:03.55]Listen, my son, he's been doing some weird things on the computer.
[162:06.21]I figured it was something like that, but you never know.
[162:09.17]Okay.
[162:10.11]Alright, Jeb.
[162:11.09]I'll tell you what.
[162:15.02]Are you keeping those?
[162:15.90]Are you keeping these?
[162:17.25]No, these appeared last night.
[162:19.23]I don't even know where they're from.
[162:20.25]Okay, I mean, because I don't mind maybe just to pay for the electricity.
[162:23.65]I can bring them back to my place.
[162:25.35]Well, I don't actually owe you any money considering that.
[162:27.75]Well, the electricity, I mean, the electricity is mine.
[162:32.30]Well, do you know how... I tried to get this to work.
[162:34.88]The saw doesn't work.
[162:36.04]Okay.
[162:36.52]The saw doesn't work.
[162:37.60]Okay, basic safety score.
[162:39.06]Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.
[162:40.56]Let me show you a couple things, okay?
[162:42.03]Let me show you a couple.
[162:42.71]My daddy taught me this, okay?
[162:44.17]He taught me two things, NASCAR and how to fix stuff.
[162:47.35]Well, you know this stuff?
[162:48.73]Exactly, exactly.
[162:49.85]Holy smokes.
[162:50.47]Okay, good.
[162:50.87]The two are pretty synonymous, by the way.
[162:52.55]So what can you tell me?
[162:53.95]What should we do in this room?
[162:56.17]Okay, well... Are you like a handy guy?
[162:57.88]Oh, for sure.
[162:58.74]Yeah, absolutely.
[163:00.12]Absolutely.
[163:00.64]I mean, I would start for sure.
[163:02.42]You've got to get some paint up on the walls.
[163:04.42]Okay.
[163:05.62]Probably move some stuff around.
[163:06.96]It's pretty dirty.
[163:07.84]Tripping hazard.
[163:09.16]Interesting.
[163:09.66]Do you know this guy?
[163:10.94]He looks a little like you.
[163:11.99]I've never seen him before in my life.
[163:13.31]Do you know who that is?
[163:14.85]No idea.
[163:15.55]That one guy's lovely, though.
[163:16.65]I've seen him.
[163:17.03]Let me see if I can see who this is.
[163:20.45]Is that you?
[163:20.71]Kiteboga?
[163:21.67]Kiteboga?
[163:22.43]Whatever.
[163:22.65]I don't know.
[163:23.09]I don't know if you've ever heard of those people.
[163:24.51]German995.com.
[163:24.79]They're all sold out.
[163:27.48]Okay, I mean, yeah, it seems like you have literally no idea what you're doing.
[163:31.37]Do you think we should start with painting?
[163:33.64]Is that what you think?
[163:34.76]Well, I mean, the first thing we're going to have to do is paint, absolutely.
[163:38.04]Have you dusted the walls yet?
[163:40.48]I've pre-dusted.
[163:41.40]Have you checked for prints?
[163:42.92]I've checked for all, yes.
[163:45.52]Well, you never know.
[163:46.24]Did you build this house yourself or you move in?
[163:48.22]Because you never know if it's like a crime scene or something.
[163:51.14]I woke up one day and I had a sling on my arm and I walked over here and this was just here.
[163:54.93]So I just figured it was mine.
[163:56.57]A sling on your arm?
[163:57.85]Yeah, I had a broken arm and I went through a window a few weeks ago.
[164:01.87]You went through a window?
[164:03.53]We...
[164:04.47]WERE YOU HERE WHEN THE FIRE HAPPENED?
[164:07.64]I HEARD SOME SIREN.
[164:08.74]I THINK I CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.
[164:10.76]I THINK I DID.
[164:12.10]THANK GOD FOR YOU BECAUSE I SHATTERED MY ARM GOING THROUGH THE WINDOW.
[164:15.28]BUT I'M FINE, THOUGH.
[164:16.34]YOU MIND IF I, LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING HERE.
[164:18.98]OKAY, SO YOU GOT THE STOOLS.
[164:20.36]HOW ABOUT PINK?
[164:21.44]YOU GOT THE STOOLS.
[164:22.62]DOES PINK WORK FOR YOU?
[164:24.84]I DON'T THINK IT WILL LOOK GOOD, BUT IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.
[164:28.86]WHAT WALL DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO FOR PINK?
[164:30.44]WHAT DO YOU THINK?
[164:31.49]What wall?
[164:32.21]Yeah.
[164:32.53]What are you even doing in here?
[164:34.73]Is this like your... Well, this is going to be my VR room.
[164:36.93]I want to be able to jump around in virtual reality.
[164:38.93]VR, what on Earth is that?
[164:40.42]Virtual reality.
[164:41.76]Virtual reality.
[164:42.70]You're getting a headset now.
[164:43.72]It's going to be my VR room.
[164:44.72]I swear, you kids have no clue what's going on.
[164:47.20]Virtual reality, you call it?
[164:48.88]What is that?
[164:49.36]By the way, I know you probably smelled gas coming up here.
[164:53.38]Gas?
[164:53.78]Like gasoline.
[164:54.66]It's me.
[164:55.22]I just want to make sure you're aware of that.
[164:56.78]No, my smell ain't that great, but...
[165:02.45]Gasolina.
[165:04.05]So you want to paint overall pink?
[165:05.49]I want to paint pink.
[165:06.53]For virtual reality.
[165:08.17]I'm just not quite sure what wall we're doing pink at the moment.
[165:11.92]Okay.
[165:12.42]I mean, what about this?
[165:13.12]You got this wall here.
[165:14.20]That's nice.
[165:14.84]This is a pretty sturdy wall.
[165:16.22]Back wall?
[165:16.88]Alright.
[165:17.22]How about we do pink?
[165:18.02]I need a tool to open this.
[165:21.12]Have you tested these walls for stability at all?
[165:23.37]Good Lord.
[165:23.85]Sorry.
[165:24.61]I just like to do that.
[165:25.69]Okay.
[165:29.22]Let me get this paint open.
[165:30.15]You have no clue what you're doing.
[165:31.89]Do you know how to open paint?
[165:33.43]I've opened paint before.
[165:34.17]I feel like it's a tuna can.
[165:35.41]I've opened paint.
[165:36.17]I've opened tuna.
[165:38.35]You've done both.
[165:40.43]I sure have.
[165:41.65]You live in the United States.
[165:42.63]We had tuna sandwiches every day when we were kids.
[165:46.34]Okay.
[165:47.70]Pink paint for virtual reality.
[165:49.36]Why is that?
[165:52.22]I just want to make sure I wear this.
[165:53.66]I would probably take off my shoes if you don't want them to be covered in paint.
[165:58.41]YOU WANT ME TO TAKE IT?
[165:59.07]SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
[166:01.05]YOU STEAL MY ELECTRICITY.
[166:02.73]THIS IS NOT STIRRED, BY THE WAY.
[166:05.45]HOW DO I Ster THIS?
[166:06.75]LISTEN, SIT BACK AND RELAX.
[166:08.27]THIS STUFF'S EASY, OKAY?
[166:09.37]IT'S ALL INTUITIVE.
[166:10.15]IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD.
[166:11.12]OKAY.
[166:11.26]YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, Steve.
[166:13.40]I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME.
[166:14.06]JEB?
[166:14.54]JEB.
[166:17.94]Alright, let's get that paint up there.
[166:19.16]Are you a painter?
[166:21.28]Of course I am.
[166:22.30]Okay, good.
[166:23.90]That looks pretty good.
[166:25.00]You like that?
[166:25.64]Yeah.
[166:26.97]So how long have you lived here for?
[166:28.97]You can't get on my floor!
[166:30.79]I'm sorry about that, okay?
[166:32.57]Listen, I told you I know how to paint.
[166:34.19]I didn't tell you I knew how to be cleanly.
[166:37.19]Alright, so we just dump it in here?
[166:39.00]Yeah, dump it.
[166:39.80]Are you a handy person?
[166:41.56]I got hands, yeah.
[166:43.94]We'll make this work, alright?
[166:45.04]Let's make it work.
[166:46.21]We'll make this work.
[166:47.11]What wall are you putting it on, huh?
[166:48.35]On the back wall.
[166:49.23]The back wall.
[166:50.21]Okay.
[166:50.91]East-facing, north-facing, south?
[166:52.83]I don't know.
[166:53.55]I don't have a compass.
[166:54.41]You have no idea?
[166:55.50]It depends on where the moss grows.
[166:56.88]You know what?
[166:57.26]By the way, you're a mess.
[166:58.70]Excuse me?
[166:59.14]You're a waste.
[167:00.78]I'm sorry.
[167:01.10]Did you say a waste?
[167:01.88]You're a big, fat mistake.
[167:04.21]I don't understand.
[167:05.25]Listen, my mother told me I fell off the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way, but I have never been more offended by someone I've never met in my life.
[167:12.84]Okay, I'm going for the back wall.
[167:14.00]And now you're painting.
[167:14.78]You're just going to paint now?
[167:16.08]Yeah.
[167:18.16]Man, I have half a mind to leave right now.
[167:19.98]Okay, you're painting.
[167:21.96]Okay.
[167:22.58]Do you think it looks good?
[167:23.70]You've got to put more paint on them.
[167:25.10]Okay.
[167:26.14]Why don't you grab a brush and help me?
[167:30.51]Why pink again?
[167:32.13]Why was that?
[167:32.89]Why pink?
[167:33.60]Why are you doing pink?
[167:35.00]Because the demons in my head told me to.
[167:37.86]Okay, you're talking about Satan?
[167:39.92]Well, it could be.
[167:40.72]I don't know.
[167:41.16]I haven't figured it out yet.
[167:42.60]You want to do nice... You got to do angled lines like that.
[167:46.05]Do you go up and down or do you go side to side?
[167:47.69]You got to go side to side or angles.
[167:50.34]Bitter coverage.
[167:51.46]By the way, and I really do mean this, and this is not a joke.
[167:54.04]This is not a joke for the stream.
[167:55.62]This is not a joke for anything.
[167:56.96]This is real life.
[167:58.61]This is the first time I have ever, in my entire adult life, in my entire childhood life, have ever put paint on a wall.
[168:05.57]Ever.
[168:06.37]Congratulations, son.
[168:08.21]Hey, there's a first time for everything.
[168:13.61]I DON'T THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LADDER TO GET THE TOP OF THIS, BY THE WAY.
[168:18.83]IS THAT WHY YOU PICKED PINK?
[168:20.10]BECAUSE YOU NEVER PAINTED BEFORE?
[168:21.50]OR DOES IT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH VIRTUAL REALITY?
[168:24.00]I THOUGHT IT WAS A COOL COLOR.
[168:25.26]I THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK NICE.
[168:28.92]That looks pretty good.
[168:30.08]You met my kids yet, Samuel?
[168:32.38]I smell.
[168:32.86]It's making me gab.
[168:34.90]It's making me gab.
[168:36.56]I'm gabbing about it.
[168:37.59]I smell so awful.
[168:39.19]Smells like my bass boat.
[168:41.41]I'm sorry.
[168:42.01]I really apologize that I smelled this awful.
[168:44.29]Oh, it's fine.
[168:45.35]It's fine.
[168:45.93]Look, it's the wood.
[168:46.75]The wood emanates like a disgusting onion and taco smell.
[168:50.66]I mean, it definitely smells like something living.
[168:52.94]It's coming for something living.
[168:54.10]I'm really sorry about this.
[168:55.42]I really am.
[168:56.10]I don't usually... I usually bathe at least once every day.
[168:58.84]So you live here alone, though?
[169:00.20]Yeah.
[169:00.99]No one to help you paint?
[169:01.97]No one to help you do nothing?
[169:02.93]No, I haven't bathed in eight days.
[169:05.69]Eight days?
[169:06.27]Eight.
[169:06.53]Is that right?
[169:07.11]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[169:07.79]I have to tell you that.
[169:08.37]That's okay.
[169:09.99]The pigs back in my yard don't bathe either.
[169:12.67]Oh, I can be like, what are your piggies?
[169:14.79]What the fuck would I say that to somebody in a public setting?
[169:20.36]We still love them, though.
[169:21.28]Is it what?
[169:23.40]Is it pink or pank?
[169:27.10]Is it pank or pink?
[169:29.38]We're talking about pank walls.
[169:36.02]You picked the colors.
[169:37.06]I was like, why are they saying that?
[169:41.20]That's how we say it around here, pank walls.
[169:44.71]Excuse me, Jeb.
[169:46.43]I appreciate the help.
[169:50.95]I really do.
[169:51.79]Thank you.
[169:52.59]How do you say milk?
[169:53.82]How do you say milk in these parts?
[169:55.54]You know, if you're going to drink a glass of milk?
[169:59.36]Say that again.
[170:00.92]If you're going to drink a glass of milk, what do you call it?
[170:03.68]You know, Jeff, I think I'm not really a big fan of the pink, if I'm honest.
[170:08.52]No?
[170:09.08]I'm actually a pretty big fan of a black wall.
[170:12.41]Really?
[170:12.73]If you want to help me paint the wall black.
[170:15.13]I got a couple more minutes.
[170:16.85]A couple more minutes.
[170:18.05]Yeah, I don't know what you're doing today or tomorrow, but I really don't like the pink.
[170:21.87]The pink doesn't pop for me.
[170:22.81]Yeah, I mean, I don't think my wife will miss me, if I'm honest.
[170:25.49]Well, you live right at 980.
[170:26.91]You're okay.
[170:27.41]Yeah, okay.
[170:28.99]We need to paint this black.
[170:29.99]It is getting kind of late, though.
[170:31.12]You sure?
[170:31.76]Yeah, I mean, we'll just be having it in a few minutes.
[170:33.88]You got food or nothing?
[170:35.00]There's no, like, you don't have a pizza?
[170:36.78]There's food downstairs.
[170:38.12]I know you came in my house completely uninvited.
[170:40.24]Yeah, because you stole my electricity just to throw it out there.
[170:43.62]I didn't steal...
[170:45.06]ANYTHING, ACTUALLY.
[170:46.60]I PLUGGED MY HOUSE INTO AN OUTLET THAT WAS ON THE STREET.
[170:50.21]I THOUGHT IT WAS A CITY OUTLET.
[170:51.73]YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A CITY OUTLET?
[170:53.95]YOU PAY TAXES?
[170:55.53]NO, I HAVEN'T PAID TAXES.
[170:56.95]OKAY.
[170:57.55]AND YOU THINK THE CITY'S JUST GONNA GIVE YOU ELECTRICITY FOR NO REASON?
[171:00.39]WE NEED ANOTHER ONE OF THESE, JEB.
[171:02.29]I'LL JUST POUR IT RIGHT IN THERE.
[171:03.37]WHO CARES?
[171:06.86]THAT'S WHERE PANK COMES FROM.
[171:11.20]Here, let me help you with that.
[171:12.64]I need the screwdriver.
[171:13.67]You really do have a stench to you.
[171:15.69]I'm sorry.
[171:17.29]They won't let me take the shower for some reason.
[171:19.25]Who's they?
[171:19.67]What are you talking about they?
[171:20.83]The people that are here.
[171:22.19]There's literally no people.
[171:24.23]I know it's just you and me, but there's like 60 fucking million people that are watching and having me do something.
[171:28.46]What are you talking about?
[171:29.98]Oh, okay, you're one of them.
[171:31.52]Huh?
[171:32.82]You mean like there's something in the walls?
[171:34.93]Yeah.
[171:35.53]I've been thinking there must be something in the drinking water as well.
[171:37.57]I mean, they have to know the way to see what I'm doing.
[171:39.55]Okay.
[171:40.25]You ever wake up at night and, like, just see random things, like things flying in space?
[171:44.13]Is that what you're referring to or not?
[171:45.48]Yeah.
[171:45.96]Jeb.
[171:47.44]What are you looking for?
[171:48.88]I'm looking for the screwdriver so I can open this.
[171:50.76]Oh, there you are.
[171:51.54]There you are.
[171:52.92]Okay, so you're saying you moved in.
[171:55.26]I moved in.
[171:55.94]Your house could be haunted.
[171:57.22]Have you ever considered that?
[171:58.12]I don't know.
[171:59.22]Jeb.
[172:00.35]Do you, like, I'm very serious one-to-one, you and I. Like, forget about anybody here.
[172:04.63]There is literally no one here.
[172:05.80]It's a wall.
[172:06.62]You don't even have a window right here.
[172:08.26]One-to-wub, one-to-wub, you and me, Jeb.
[172:12.13]IS THERE ANY DRUG PROBLEMS IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?
[172:15.19]DRUG PROBLEMS?
[172:16.39]YEAH.
[172:16.87]YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, LIKE, WHAT KIND OF DRUGS IN SPECIFIC?
[172:20.23]LIKE ACIDOMENOPHENE OR WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
[172:23.74]I DON'T KNOW.
[172:24.28]I JUST FEEL LIKE PEOPLE ARE ON CRACK IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
[172:27.14]CAN YOU MOVE THAT BOX OUT OF THE WAY, JEB?
[172:29.24]YEAH, SURE.
[172:29.72]WHAT'S IN HERE?
[172:31.88]WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO MOVE IT?
[172:33.54]JUST KICK IT FORWARD.
[172:35.71]JUST PUSH IT FORWARD.
[172:36.91]LITERALLY, JUST...
[172:39.04]Yeah, just throw it off into the bathroom.
[172:41.88]Daddy, just push it over.
[172:43.08]Just kick it.
[172:43.91]It doesn't matter.
[172:47.47]There's a wall here.
[172:48.31]I don't understand.
[172:48.97]Jeb, this is green.
[172:50.71]This isn't even black.
[172:52.39]This is green.
[172:53.79]This is green paint.
[172:55.21]I told you you ain't good at this.
[172:56.57]You really ain't good at this.
[172:57.89]Jeb.
[172:58.21]Okay.
[172:59.99]Oh, fucking God damn it.
[173:02.00]Is that black?
[173:02.94]Excuse me.
[173:03.50]Can you check?
[173:04.26]We don't use words like that.
[173:05.40]I'm sorry, Jeb.
[173:10.21]HOLD ON.
[173:11.79]YOU REALLY GOT TO TAKE CARE OF THAT STAND SHOT, I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW.
[173:17.19]SO YOU DON'T SHOWER BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO YOU IN YOUR HOUSE.
[173:20.47]WELL, I DON'T SHOWER BECAUSE THEY DON'T LET ME.
[173:24.27]THE GHOSTS TELL YOU NOT TO TAKE A SHOWER.
[173:26.53]I DON'T EVEN KNOW, GHOSTS, PEOPLE, SHADOW PEOPLE.
[173:29.29]YOU WANT TO APPEASE THE GHOSTS WHO THINK YOU'RE STINKY.
[173:32.05]JEB, LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION.
[173:33.88]DO YOU JUST WAKE UP WITH FURNITURE IN YOUR HOUSE?
[173:37.04]NO, I PAY FOR IT BECAUSE I HAVE A JOB.
[173:39.48]You ever thought about getting one of those?
[173:40.62]Where do you think I got a house like this from?
[173:42.34]Good point.
[173:42.78]Okay.
[173:43.48]Fair enough.
[173:43.86]You paid for it?
[173:44.71]Excuse me.
[173:45.51]Excuse me.
[173:46.49]No, I don't have any money.
[173:49.15]I have like probably... I'm sorry.
[173:50.61]So you're saying you want us to paint black over your pink wall right there?
[173:54.13]That's what I've been told.
[173:55.58]Okay.
[173:56.50]From the demons.
[173:58.66]I'll take care of it for you, alright?
[174:00.34]Why don't you just clean up a little bit of your stain or something?
[174:03.42]Just a tiny bit.
[174:05.62]Can you guys please do me a favor and just make it so we don't have to talk about this every five seconds?
[174:10.53]I'm filling the house with, like, human gas.
[174:13.35]Like, please, just pick a shower.
[174:16.55]We're painting the walls like pink and then black and whatever.
[174:19.39]Please, just pick it so he doesn't, he's disgusted.
[174:22.47]Okay, so listen, I told you I know how to do stuff in a house.
[174:24.89]I am not an interior designer, so what do you expect me to do here?
[174:28.45]You want me to kind of just black on the back wall?
[174:30.47]Dip it in there?
[174:31.47]Yes, just dip it in there, black on the back wall.
[174:33.75]Okay, you know, my wife makes a mean turkey casserole.
[174:36.49]She just takes mayonnaise and pretty much that's it.
[174:41.23]That's it?
[174:42.73]Yeah, we really, oh, I'm sorry about that.
[174:44.68]You just ruined the floor?
[174:46.54]Hold on, you make, there's a turkey casserole.
[174:48.06]This is a very significantly watered down version of black pan, I hope you understand.
[174:52.34]Okay, I just want to get curious, I just want to make sure I caught that correctly.
[174:55.94]You have a turkey casserole, and what's in it?
[174:57.60]Yeah, listen, we're a big fan, you can make a casserole out of anything.
[175:00.80]Oh, a big fan of Jerma 995?
[175:03.24]A casserole out of anything with mayonnaise.
[175:05.52]Well, I just didn't wait for it.
[175:06.98]Oh, shit.
[175:07.80]Do you have, um... I think you made a new pan.
[175:13.84]Okay.
[175:16.27]Okay, listen, this is easy.
[175:17.27]This is easy, alright?
[175:20.39]We'll just run back and forth.
[175:21.72]Well, don't come over my domain.
[175:24.08]It is kind of fun, though.
[175:25.56]Do you want the ladder?
[175:26.42]We need to get up there, too.
[175:27.68]I mean, it's not bad.
[175:28.54]It's not bad.
[175:29.64]Look, you can even draw on it.
[175:30.68]What's your name again?
[175:31.87]My name is Jeffrey.
[175:33.59]J-E-F... Jeffrey 900.
[175:34.77]J-E-F-F-F-R-E-E-A.
[175:40.47]F-R.
[175:41.39]Thank God.
[175:43.95]J-R-F-E.
[175:45.23]Good luck.
[175:45.54]Just keep doing what you're doing.
[175:46.72]I'm sorry, what?
[175:47.80]I just have to take a shower.
[175:49.12]Just do what you're doing.
[175:50.88]This ain't my house.
[175:55.84]Excuse me?
[175:56.32]Hello?
[175:59.10]Are you coming back or you gonna get like pizza or something or like mayonnaise?
[176:07.01]Okay.
[176:09.33]That's the wrong door again.
[176:10.89]That's the wrong door again.
[176:11.79]There's the right door.
[176:15.80]Okay.
[176:31.21]Taking a shower.
[176:37.93]he's coming around the turn back out there do I brush my teeth four times a day won't need the pit stop we're on nascar this we're going nascar this
[177:04.12]It's so much better.
[177:05.02]Oh, my God.
[177:05.46]I smell like a dirty gas cupboard.
[177:08.58]I'm just embarrassing myself.
[177:12.60]People are embarrassed to be in the same room with me.
[177:14.50]People are embarrassed.
[177:20.49]Okay, not bad.
[177:24.07]Thank God.
[177:39.79]No, I can still, I still feel like I smell.
[177:41.46]You know when you take a shower and you're like not showering for three days?
[177:45.75]And then you smell, you can still smell your armpits.
[177:49.03]I was like, God, I need to do this every single day.
[177:51.57]Put me down by the river.
[177:53.64]Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.
[177:54.98]I'm NASCAR'd that time.
[177:56.18]That looks great.
[177:56.88]Thank you.
[177:57.78]That looks great.
[177:59.12]Thank you.
[177:59.84]Is that all you wanted?
[178:00.60]I mean, this place don't look much better than when I got here.
[178:03.28]I feel like.
[178:04.38]Jeff, I think it looks good.
[178:05.52]I kind of want to move this out of the way.
[178:07.19]Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[178:08.75]Again, I'm not.
[178:09.69]I almost just bit my ankle.
[178:11.21]I'm fine.
[178:12.17]I don't know much about safety.
[178:13.25]What do you think about this wall, Jeff?
[178:15.41]I mean, it doesn't look good.
[178:17.13]I want to get... Before you came into the house, I wanted to get rid of this wall.
[178:23.73]Oh, you're talking about that wall right there.
[178:25.07]I don't like to call it a VR.
[178:26.59]Yeah, that's the northeast-south facing wall.
[178:28.66]Okay.
[178:29.92]North-northeast-south facing.
[178:32.96]I mean, you could probably get rid of it pretty easy.
[178:35.00]Hold on, Jim.
[178:35.54]I'm just going to take care of something.
[178:37.06]You don't want to paint it or nothing?
[178:40.57]Just give me a second, I'm just gonna cover this.
[178:42.45]Okay, I mean, you... No, I wanna get rid of it, it's a VR room.
[178:45.45]Okay, you got a lot of paint around here, man.
[178:50.20]Jeff, I gotta go get my robe on.
[178:52.46]Your robe.
[178:53.96]Can you please bring me some sort of food?
[178:55.56]I mean, I've been here for what, like three days?
[178:57.98]I'm just kidding.
[178:58.66]Do you like cookies?
[178:59.64]Three hours.
[179:00.36]Cookies?
[179:00.88]Do you like cookies?
[179:01.56]Yeah, pecan sandies.
[179:02.36]What do you got?
[179:02.82]Let me just get my robe on.
[179:03.60]Sugar cookies, molasses cookies, chocolate chip cookies, mayonnaise cookies.
[179:08.86]I like every kind of cookie, by the way.
[179:12.01]What am I, like a 1940s billionaire?
[179:14.37]Like, what are you talking about?
[179:16.33]Put your robe on.
[179:18.01]Put your robe on.
[179:18.61]What are you talking about?
[179:19.67]I don't even know where it is.
[179:20.71]Where is it?
[179:23.51]Let me see what he's got around here.
[179:24.81]He wants to dig that wall down, huh?
[179:27.41]You're like a playboy.
[179:29.89]I don't even know where my robe is.
[179:33.62]Alright.
[179:34.42]Hard day's work.
[179:35.56]That's what I'm talking about.
[179:36.54]Hard day's work.
[179:37.12]I don't know where the robe is.
[179:39.50]Alright.
[179:40.60]Oh, my God.
[179:49.25]Oh!
[180:05.91]Excuse me, Jeb.
[180:07.09]Yeah, yeah.
[180:08.48]Be right back.
[180:08.98]You say you want to take that wall out, huh?
[180:11.02]I want to take it down.
[180:11.96]You want me to get started on that, or... Um, I... Are you literally going to do anything?
[180:16.02]There are safety glasses there, Jeb.
[180:17.92]Safety glasses?
[180:19.84]I would put them on.
[180:24.41]I want this wall down.
[180:27.03]So, let me get this straight.
[180:27.91]You have safety glasses in this house.
[180:30.25]Yeah.
[180:31.09]But demons keep you up at night, making you not shower.
[180:35.23]It's like you're prepared for certain things that don't make no sense.
[180:39.35]Do you want to help or do you want to go home?
[180:40.69]Now listen, I don't think you have any clue what you're doing.
[180:43.03]I don't.
[180:46.19]You ever demolished something before?
[180:48.41]Get these off.
[180:49.15]No, never.
[180:50.05]Never?
[180:51.39]I've done a thing or two in my life.
[180:52.85]Well, because if I do VR, I don't want to bump into the wall and like, oh, I'm doing VR.
[180:58.21]Oh, shit, I hit the wall.
[181:01.05]I think it has to come down.
[181:01.85]Okay.
[181:03.07]Let's see if I can get it down.
[181:05.24]Thor's hammer over here.
[181:07.26]Are you going to help me?
[181:07.82]You look kind of funny with your robe on.
[181:09.00]I'm not going to lie.
[181:09.54]Let's see what I can do.
[181:12.08]Oh, Lord.
[181:12.56]Okay, you're for real.
[181:13.36]You're taking that ball down.
[181:15.26]Yeah.
[181:15.66]I mean, it's got to come down.
[181:17.16]Alright.
[181:17.54]Hey, hey, hey.
[181:18.68]You ever thought about pretending like you're on the back nine?
[181:21.05]Like a golf swing?
[181:22.05]Yeah.
[181:22.51]I mean, get a little bit of power into it.
[181:23.89]Sure.
[181:25.39]That's not quite what I meant.
[181:28.43]That's not a golf swing, my friend.
[181:30.51]That was a golf swing.
[181:31.93]Let me show you.
[181:32.51]Hold on, let me get one more.
[181:36.32]I'm going to just step over here for a second.
[181:41.52]I just bounced off.
[181:42.72]Would you like to try again?
[181:43.92]Let me at least show you a little.
[181:45.70]Show me how you do it.
[181:46.62]I'm talking about pretending you're on the back nine, and you don't want to get back home, okay?
[181:50.90]You don't want to get back home because you've got a lot going on?
[181:53.04]Yeah.
[181:53.66]Let me just line up my shot really quick.
[181:55.26]Okay.
[181:58.46]Okay.
[182:00.29]Are you a putter or are you a driver?
[182:01.71]You got another hammer or no?
[182:03.25]No, I'm just watching you do this.
[182:05.43]Okay.
[182:07.59]You see that?
[182:08.05]That was actually really good for not very much effort.
[182:11.21]And then you can just go back and forth.
[182:14.05]That's very good.
[182:16.18]Very easy.
[182:16.76]Hey, Jeff, let me see that for a second.
[182:18.80]Let me show you something, Jeff.
[182:24.96]Hey, Jeff, get a load of this.
[182:29.93]I've never been more afraid in my life than right now.
[182:32.15]I may have just sold my pants.
[182:33.35]Hey, Jeff, you want to take a swing?
[182:34.55]I may have just sold my pants.
[182:36.23]It's going to be more than one person stinking up this place right now, I'll tell you that.
[182:41.44]Go for a swing, Jeff.
[182:43.18]I mean, you want to take the whole wall down?
[182:44.58]I want it down.
[182:45.44]I don't want it there.
[182:47.08]Are you sure about that?
[182:53.00]Stay good.
[182:54.32]How many more swings?
[182:56.04]I don't know.
[182:57.16]I don't want to do all the work for you.
[182:59.28]I don't want to do everything.
[183:00.76]I want a big one into that right wall.
[183:02.78]Okay, listen.
[183:03.28]You take that part down.
[183:04.12]That's for you.
[183:04.56]That's your house.
[183:06.01]You hit it right up there in the quadrant.
[183:08.03]Jerma.
[183:08.95]You give me like two seconds just to hide.
[183:11.61]Jerma, you're short.
[183:13.03]Jerma, you're like 5'5".
[183:13.77]No, I'm not.
[183:14.77]Fuck you.
[183:15.39]You're like 5'6".
[183:15.93]I'm fucking 5'7".
[183:17.11]Idiot.
[183:17.45]Shut up.
[183:18.07]Fucking idiot.
[183:18.51]Are you talking to me?
[183:20.12]Yeah.
[183:21.06]Excuse me.
[183:21.40]Move.
[183:30.20]You're really digging that wall down, aren't you?
[183:33.16]Yeah!
[183:34.22]You get it up right there, that whole wall's gonna come down, I think.
[183:38.38]Yeah!
[183:39.73]That's right, that's what I'm talking about.
[183:42.13]You work out?
[183:42.75]Not in five years.
[183:44.89]No?
[183:44.95]Okay.
[183:46.01]Let's get this out of the way.
[183:49.73]Can you get that out of there, Jeb?
[183:51.45]Yeah.
[183:52.95]Man, you really are stingy.
[183:54.33]Or is that me?
[183:55.83]I think that's you at this point, because I took a shower.
[183:59.31]I mean, I did soil myself.
[184:01.67]I tell you what, why don't you hit it like, you hit it around here or something, okay?
[184:07.35]Give it the sweet touch.
[184:08.39]Right here?
[184:08.83]Yeah.
[184:09.45]You want to do it?
[184:10.19]No, it's all you.
[184:10.75]It's your house.
[184:11.85]Okay.
[184:13.45]How about right in the middle, right there?
[184:14.43]I feel significantly unsafe, is all I want to say.
[184:18.02]What's it, Mario?
[184:18.86]You play Mario?
[184:19.68]Whatever it is you're doing, I don't care.
[184:23.88]Oh, so long, Gevauser.
[184:37.99]I did realize one thing.
[184:39.01]You got a bunch of studs there.
[184:40.67]Are there studs in the wall, Jim?
[184:42.25]Yeah.
[184:42.89]What do we do about that?
[184:43.67]You're going to have to take those down at some point.
[184:50.17]Let me use my hands.
[184:50.87]Why don't you take a swing, Jim?
[184:53.39]Why don't you take a swing?
[184:58.65]We were literally... The last part.
[185:02.95]Oh, that's perfect!
[185:04.71]Whoa!
[185:05.55]We can... Yeah, man.
[185:08.09]Oh, wowee, I'm strong!
[185:10.58]Wowee!
[185:11.58]You did that all by yourself?
[185:14.46]Hold on, let me... Hold on a second.
[185:19.08]Ah!
[185:19.92]Oh, sweet lord.
[185:21.76]Ah!
[185:22.16]Hey, I got you.
[185:22.98]I got you.
[185:27.95]Oh, Lord.
[185:29.67]I'm gonna be feeling that for a while.
[185:31.99]Alright.
[185:33.42]Okay, that ain't hard either.
[185:35.04]What's left?
[185:35.44]What the heck is that thing?
[185:37.74]What is it?
[185:38.00]Is it painting?
[185:39.80]Yeah, you can probably get this down if you need to.
[185:41.59]Can I get this down?
[185:43.33]Well, I mean... Hold on.
[185:44.49]Watch out, Jeff.
[185:45.85]No, please don't.
[185:46.61]Okay.
[185:48.65]Whatever.
[185:48.97]It's your house, man.
[185:57.71]That's meant for structure.
[185:59.41]I would probably use the screwdriver.
[186:01.13]You want to do that?
[186:02.37]I would do it.
[186:03.95]By the way, I asked for a cookie.
[186:08.17]You're right.
[186:09.59]He did ask for a cookie.
[186:15.91]I'll get him a cookie, okay?
[186:17.04]He asked for it.
[186:29.79]Why is that down here?
[186:33.31]Okay, that don't make no sense.
[186:42.16]I'm just bringing them up.
[186:52.60]Just bringing them up.
[187:02.50]You want a cookie, you want food, of course.
[187:05.04]Got to be neighborly.
[187:06.65]Got to be a good neighbor.
[187:11.29]Got to be a good neighbor.
[187:16.88]Gab?
[187:17.92]Hey, how are you?
[187:18.68]How are you doing?
[187:20.20]I've got some cookies for you.
[187:21.70]Thank you.
[187:22.06]You make those yourself?
[187:23.26]Yes, I do.
[187:23.94]It kind of looks like my mother made those.
[187:26.14]Would you like one?
[187:27.57]I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD EAT WITH THESE HANDS.
[187:29.21]CAN YOU FEED IT TO ME?
[187:45.23]Sorry about that.
[187:47.15]Oh, Lord.
[187:47.97]Hey, let me ask you something.
[187:49.67]You built this house yourself or you bought it?
[187:52.88]What's that?
[187:53.56]You built this house yourself or you bought it?
[187:55.62]I bought this house.
[187:56.64]It was upgraded a few times, but I purchased it.
[187:58.50]Okay, because this is strange, okay?
[188:01.28]There's no reason to have this in a closet, alright?
[188:04.87]And listen to this, alright?
[188:06.35]Yep.
[188:10.19]This is not mine.
[188:10.85]Look at this.
[188:13.13]Holy shit.
[188:13.85]That is real weird.
[188:15.84]Is there something behind here?
[188:17.48]By the way, we might be able to take this down, but I am not sure, to be honest with you.
[188:23.28]Oh, okay.
[188:23.70]I'm just going to step over.
[188:25.84]Get this fucking thing down!
[188:28.08]We can't get the door frame down.
[188:34.62]I'm not sure about that.
[188:35.90]You know, there's a painting in here, Jeb.
[188:38.62]Let's look at that painting.
[188:39.24]Really interesting.
[188:41.60]Do we have any... I want to see what's back there.
[188:45.22]I don't know what that is.
[188:46.37]I mean, the weird part is that whole painting is kind of like stuck to the wall.
[188:50.59]Why is it glued?
[188:51.75]It's like the previous owner put something there.
[188:53.39]Alright, hold on.
[188:54.19]Let me see.
[188:54.53]Can I cut it?
[188:55.43]How old is this house?
[188:57.76]Hold on.
[188:58.08]Can I cut through it?
[189:00.42]You got to put a little more effort into it.
[189:07.14]Have you ever used that in real life?
[189:08.48]I've never used one of these before.
[189:10.01]I mean, in real life either.
[189:11.17]Okay.
[189:11.51]First time for everything.
[189:12.37]That's alright.
[189:17.57]Why would there be a painting back here?
[189:21.03]I mean, I guess it could be some sort of shrine.
[189:23.73]Jeb.
[189:24.33]You did say there were demons in the house.
[189:26.19]Give me the sledgehammer.
[189:27.36]Okay.
[189:29.66]You did say there were demons in the house.
[189:31.28]Maybe someone was trying to do some sort of, you know.
[189:33.20]Jeb, give me the sledgehammer.
[189:34.36]Okay, I'm going to walk away now.
[189:40.34]You going to give a little force to it?
[189:44.41]Jeb.
[189:49.87]Yeah, you're not really good at that.
[189:50.79]There's definitely something back here, Jeb.
[189:52.57]What do you think's back there?
[189:57.30]Why is this made of steel?
[189:59.42]Are you kidding me?
[190:01.86]Holy shit, there are screws here.
[190:03.00]Hold on.
[190:04.02]Okay.
[190:05.90]What's that?
[190:06.48]What's that?
[190:08.02]There's that, too.
[190:08.68]I mean, you really can't cut that?
[190:11.58]I'm scared.
[190:12.12]Are you?
[190:13.96]I have never been.
[190:16.27]No, thank you.
[190:17.05]No, thank you.
[190:19.13]Alright.
[190:21.74]What is that?
[190:22.10]I don't understand.
[190:22.56]Why is it here?
[190:24.50]It's the wrong way.
[190:25.18]I'll tell you what.
[190:26.32]I bet you could cut through it if you'd like.
[190:27.89]Would you like me to cut through it?
[190:28.91]How do you get this to go in reverse?
[190:30.33]Okay, let me see.
[190:30.67]You go ahead and try.
[190:32.68]I'll take care of everything for you.
[190:34.96]Can it go in reverse?
[190:36.60]Yeah, this is the wrong thing.
[190:37.48]That ain't going to work, okay?
[190:38.62]I'll tell you what.
[190:40.78]Where's that knife?
[190:41.50]Where's that knife?
[190:42.28]Jeff, be careful.
[190:43.32]It's hard to cut through.
[190:44.88]I'll be careful, alright?
[190:46.06]Jeff, be very careful.
[190:47.64]I promise.
[190:47.96]It's a very sharp knife.
[190:49.48]Thank you, my liege.
[190:50.47]Yes, be careful.
[190:52.17]So you moved here how long ago?
[190:54.87]A week ago, two weeks ago.
[190:55.71]Okay, are you married at all?
[190:56.97]No.
[190:57.39]You're not married?
[190:58.39]I've never been married, not married.
[190:59.79]Okay, why not?
[191:01.50]because I'm not ready yet.
[191:03.82]You know, somebody asked me the same question a week ago, the same exact thing.
[191:08.13]The sleep demons are telling you something?
[191:09.99]No, somebody that may even be part of your family.
[191:12.01]I don't know.
[191:13.49]Excuse me?
[191:13.95]I don't know.
[191:14.99]Just focus on that.
[191:15.67]It's a very sharp blade.
[191:17.39]Sorry, I've done this a couple times.
[191:20.07]Unfortunately.
[191:20.90]This is the most sturdy painting.
[191:23.20]There's been a few times in my life where I'd have to take down a painting via razor blade.
[191:27.80]I don't know.
[191:30.07]We're almost done.
[191:30.71]I'm gonna let you do the... You got it?
[191:31.79]I'm gonna let you do most of the work.
[191:33.16]Here.
[191:34.35]Okay.
[191:36.38]LOOKS GOOD.
[191:36.98]YOU SEEN THE FITNESS INSTRUCTOR?
[191:39.88]YEAH, YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT.
[191:41.12]HAS HE GONE IN YOUR HOUSE?
[191:42.98]OH, YEAH.
[191:43.84]HE GOES IN YOUR HOUSE, TOO?
[191:46.26]WHY DO YOU LET HIM DO THAT?
[191:47.28]THAT'S LIKE A HOME INVASION.
[191:49.40]YOU DIDN'T SIGN THE HOA?
[191:51.04]NO, WHAT HOA?
[191:52.09]OKAY.
[191:52.47]LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET IN THERE.
[191:54.75]LET ME SEE THAT KNIFE.
[191:56.21]YOU WANT THE KNIFE?
[191:56.97]YEAH.
[191:57.91]THERE YOU ARE.
[191:58.81]I WANT TO GET THIS AWAY FROM EVERYBODY.
[192:00.65]OH, I UNDERSTAND.
[192:02.23]CAN WE GET IN THERE?
[192:03.13]YEAH, LET ME SEE.
[192:04.58]There's something back here, I think.
[192:06.16]Here.
[192:07.30]There's something.
[192:09.28]Good Lord.
[192:14.59]Whoa!
[192:15.31]Holy shit!
[192:17.31]What is this?
[192:20.09]What is this?
[192:20.99]Is this safe back here?
[192:23.27]What is that?
[192:24.09]Okay, and you said you bought this house?
[192:26.65]I bought this house.
[192:28.05]Okay.
[192:29.31]Oh, my God, it's a safe!
[192:31.99]You know how to get that open or not?
[192:33.27]I don't know the code.
[192:34.19]Hold on, let me try.
[192:35.25]Okay.
[192:41.07]Let me just double check.
[192:41.95]Have you ever opened a safe before?
[192:43.31]Because I'm finding there are a significant number of things you've never done.
[192:45.97]I watch YouTube videos that can explain it.
[192:47.65]You listen for the little... Okay.
[192:51.44]You hear that?
[192:52.18]Right there?
[192:53.48]You hear it?
[192:54.20]Right there?
[192:54.78]Okay.
[192:56.32]Yeah, I don't hear nothing.
[192:57.16]I can't get it.
[192:58.80]You could sledgehammer it?
[193:00.14]I mean, maybe.
[193:01.66]I do know a guy.
[193:03.10]I swear to God, this house was built like five days ago.
[193:06.51]That's weird.
[193:07.36]Okay.
[193:07.92]I mean, it's up to you.
[193:08.66]I know a guy if you need help.
[193:10.71]I know a locksmith we can call.
[193:12.49]You know a guy?
[193:13.09]I know a guy.
[193:13.93]I got a guy for everything.
[193:14.95]We could break it, too.
[193:16.63]You want to try?
[193:17.45]We could.
[193:18.03]Listen, I'm going to say I don't have a significant amount of confidence that you're going to be able to break that safe if you couldn't break that wall down.
[193:24.69]But that's just me.
[193:25.69]I mean, is that like a joke or something?
[193:27.29]I've been proved wrong before, but that's alright.
[193:30.17]If you want to give it a shot.
[193:31.17]Give your guy a call.
[193:32.27]Okay.
[193:32.91]Alright.
[193:33.69]Can I borrow your phone, though, because I didn't bring my phone over.
[193:37.08]It's downstairs.
[193:37.70]It's downstairs.
[193:38.20]It's down in the kitchen.
[193:39.34]Okay.
[193:39.72]Well, you know a guy that can come do this?
[193:41.28]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[193:41.72]Give me two seconds.
[193:42.58]Okay.
[193:42.74]Give me two seconds.
[193:46.46]He knows a guy.
[193:47.91]Okay.
[193:50.87]To open the safe?
[193:51.75]I don't know what's in it.
[193:53.89]Because this is an upgrade.
[193:55.93]I didn't know this was even in here.
[193:57.17]Was this part of the foundation?
[193:58.93]Well, the foundation's on the ground.
[194:00.11]So, Jerma, what are you, stupid?
[194:02.89]We're, like, on a second story.
[194:06.83]He knows a guy.
[194:07.65]Call him.
[194:13.91]I think people like tools because of the sounds they make.
[194:16.87]You think that, too?
[194:18.17]You guys think that, too?
[194:18.79]You know what I mean?
[194:20.01]Just like, it's like, oh, yeah, let me get my tool.
[194:23.58]It just feels very, like, manly.
[194:26.49]Like, oh, yeah, let me get my tools.
[194:27.53]Yeah, it's Jim.
[194:29.05]How you doing, man?
[194:30.21]Yeah.
[194:31.45]Okay, you're not busy right now?
[194:33.17]Listen, I got a thing or two we could get taken care of.
[194:36.11]You want to come on down and get her down?
[194:39.75]Yeah, come on over pronto.
[194:40.95]I got a little bit of a situation I could use your help with, okay?
[194:44.37]I'll let you call the guy.
[194:45.99]Yeah, no problem.
[194:47.45]Can I get in there with this?
[194:49.79]Okay.
[194:50.07]America, alright.
[194:59.34]I can't get in.
[194:59.98]I don't know the combo.
[195:00.58]I don't know what to do.
[195:09.68]Hey, can you get the door?
[195:10.98]Yeah, I got you.
[195:11.67]I got you.
[195:12.19]Nobody's at the door.
[195:13.51]If it's your guy, I don't want to breed him.
[195:15.89]You know him.
[195:19.89]Come on in.
[195:20.59]Come on in.
[195:23.06]Hey, Jeb.
[195:23.88]Hey, how's it going, my guy?
[195:25.36]Good to see you.
[195:26.10]Oh, you are a blue collar as always.
[195:28.26]Come on in, come on in.
[195:30.20]Listen, if you could keep this on the down low, alright?
[195:32.80]I got a safe situation up there.
[195:34.84]I need someone to crack it.
[195:36.04]I want to make sure that... I'll make sure you get paid, if you know what I mean.
[195:39.34]Sure, yeah, alright.
[195:40.54]Let's head upstairs.
[195:41.34]Anything for you, Jeb.
[195:42.66]Thank you, brother.
[195:43.40]It's not your place, right?
[195:44.72]Down the street.
[195:45.72]Oh, no, no, no, not for sure.
[195:48.94]Keep going, keep going.
[195:49.92]This...
[195:51.78]confusing layout.
[195:53.02]I'm gonna tell you right now.
[195:53.84]That makes no fucking sense.
[195:55.79]That makes zero sense.
[195:57.77]He's trying to paint his wall pink and black.
[196:00.45]Pink up there.
[196:01.15]That sounds dumb.
[196:01.87]You can go up the stairs.
[196:03.05]There could be gems.
[196:04.63]Jewels.
[196:06.17]Gold.
[196:06.51]There might be gold in there.
[196:08.74]Gold's still expensive.
[196:11.50]If it's gold, that's awesome.
[196:14.18]Who would put a safe in a wall?
[196:15.12]It's ridiculous.
[196:18.54]Why would you put a safe in a wall?
[196:20.68]unless it was to hide something very, very important.
[196:22.68]Hey.
[196:23.72]What?
[196:24.52]Alright.
[196:25.20]What the fuck is this?
[196:27.38]A little bit of a war zone up here.
[196:29.28]We swear when we come in a room.
[196:30.77]Okay.
[196:31.85]Alright.
[196:32.57]This is my guy.
[196:33.49]That's your guy?
[196:34.13]He can take care of pretty much anything.
[196:35.71]What's your name?
[196:37.09]What's up?
[196:37.61]What's your name?
[196:38.03]I'm a locksmith.
[196:38.67]He doesn't need to know, right?
[196:39.63]No.
[196:40.23]Okay.
[196:40.35]Alright.
[196:40.97]You're good.
[196:41.86]Okay, we have a safe here.
[196:43.66]Okay.
[196:44.86]I didn't want to break it.
[196:45.66]I didn't want to swing at it or anything.
[196:46.84]Alright.
[196:47.30]But it's here.
[196:49.70]Can you get into this?
[196:50.50]For the record, have you tried to get into it while I was gone?
[196:53.49]I've tried.
[196:54.15]Why would I know what combination it was?
[196:55.57]I don't know.
[196:56.07]In a sense, you're safe.
[196:56.83]It should be pretty standard.
[196:58.31]Okay.
[196:59.37]Was it behind anything?
[197:01.13]It was a painting and a wall.
[197:02.92]He's a neighbor.

[197:34.37]It's like an ocean violation.
[197:36.67]He's really, really sweet.
[197:38.88]How many days did Moses ride the boat?
[197:41.00]How long was the rain?
[197:42.10]A week.
[197:46.12]THE RAIN?
[197:46.54]40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS.
[197:50.34]40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS.
[197:51.94]WHAT'S THE TIME FRAME ON YOU GETTING INTO THAT SAFE?
[197:55.38]ARE YOU RUSHING ME?
[197:56.38]NO, I JUST WAS CURIOUS.
[197:57.25]I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK.
[197:58.23]I MEAN, DEPENDS.
[198:00.59]OKAY.
[198:00.93]WELL, I HOPE HE GETS IT.
[198:01.55]I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A QUICK QUESTION.
[198:03.73]YEAH.
[198:04.37]ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE IDEA THAT POSSESSION IS NINE-TENTHS OF THE LAW?
[198:08.87]You're going to have to say that again and explain like I'm five.
[198:12.57]Okay.
[198:13.05]They say possession is nine-tenths of the law.
[198:15.46]You understand that?
[198:16.00]I will explain it even deeper.
[198:17.24]Okay, so conceptually it would mean... Okay, you know what nine-tenths is?
[198:21.02]It means nine out of ten.
[198:22.68]Yeah, nine out of ten.
[198:23.84]I think that... Hold on.
[198:26.17]How many percentages is that?
[198:27.37]I think here's the point.
[198:30.09]Whoever has what's in that safe owns it.
[198:33.19]You understand?
[198:33.61]Yeah.
[198:37.09]You're just making no sense to me.
[198:38.09]Okay.
[198:38.43]Did you get it?
[198:39.31]I can't get it.
[198:39.63]What do you mean you can't get it?
[198:41.20]I'm fucking with you.
[198:41.88]I'm the best.
[198:44.14]Okay.
[198:45.12]Alright.
[198:45.64]You want to get in there?
[198:46.30]Well, you got it?
[198:46.86]What's in it?
[198:47.84]Whoa!
[198:48.02]What's in it?
[198:48.64]Okay, okay.
[198:50.92]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second.
[198:53.26]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[198:54.66]Well, we have to have a conversation about pay.
[198:56.58]No, no, no, no, no.
[198:57.76]Let me see that.
[198:58.32]I don't know who this is.
[199:00.84]This is my house.
[199:02.00]No, I have no clue.
[199:03.60]You got the safe open.
[199:04.72]Well, you know, it's a pleasure to work with you as well.
[199:07.80]You got the safe open.
[199:08.73]Okay.
[199:09.09]Take a cut.
[199:09.93]You got the safe open?
[199:10.79]Yeah.
[199:11.27]Thank you.
[199:11.63]Let me see what's in there.
[199:12.39]Well, what if we just figure out payment?
[199:14.25]Let me see what's in the safe.
[199:16.49]You want it?
[199:17.31]You want it?
[199:17.69]Let me see what's in the safe.
[199:19.17]Gotcha.
[199:19.51]Get downstairs now.
[199:20.35]Okay.
[199:20.49]Get downstairs right now.
[199:21.13]I'm saying, why are we going downstairs?
[199:22.50]Because I don't... I want everybody out of this room because I don't want to be up here.
[199:27.06]Get downstairs.
[199:27.60]You might want to pocket some of that.
[199:29.00]It's my goddamn house.
[199:30.04]Whatever's in the wall is mine.
[199:31.60]That's absolute bullshit.
[199:32.54]That's a shit ton of money.
[199:34.16]I'm not comfortable with you touching all of the stuff that's in a wall in my house.
[199:38.83]You didn't even know it was there, though.
[199:40.31]It's my house, so you took it from my house.
[199:42.69]I mean, but he didn't build this house.
[199:44.05]We live in private property, actually.
[199:45.75]He didn't build this house.
[199:46.85]Hallelujah, brother.
[199:48.91]Let's just, hold on.
[199:49.75]Wait.
[199:50.21]Let's just go ahead.
[199:50.79]Let's get an ad break.
[199:53.15]Ad break.
[199:53.51]I want to get this sorted.
[199:54.35]I'm sorry.
[199:54.63]What did you say?
[199:55.31]A what break?
[199:56.45]Just go into the kitchen.
[199:57.29]Ad break.
[199:58.18]What is this guy talking about?
[199:59.92]Ad break now.
[200:01.10]Hey, we're going to sort this.
[200:02.24]Thank you.
[200:02.87]Don't hand people money that didn't do it.
[200:07.20]Ad break.
[200:08.50]Right back.
[206:56.70]Hello, welcome back.
[206:58.20]Hi.
[206:59.30]I want to take a quick second to go over a couple things kind of off camera with just no jokes or anything.
[207:08.74]I want to talk about the show and how it even was able to happen in the first place.
[207:13.28]Coinbase came in at the last second and let us be able to do this show.
[207:21.36]And when I say that, I mean that.
[207:23.64]All the things you see back here were really only possible because of this company here.
[207:28.17]And I really mean that.
[207:28.97]I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true.
[207:30.73]Twitch came in and gave us a bunch of money.
[207:33.59]Coinbase gave us a bunch of money.
[207:35.95]What you see here is only because of those two companies.
[207:39.47]And I couldn't afford any of this stuff.
[207:42.35]There's no way I could have done any of this on my own.
[207:45.75]And when you talk about, like, sponsorships, you talk about sponsors...
[207:50.01]You've seen the show.
[207:51.92]They've let us do whatever we want.
[207:53.88]We didn't have to do anything.
[207:56.42]Twitch and Coinbase, they just let us do what we wanted.
[208:01.68]I've used Coinbase for the last five years.
[208:05.28]Those of you that know this channel, I used to have an Ethereum address that you could donate to.
[208:09.28]It was real.
[208:11.38]And I have to thank them, because without their support, the show doesn't happen.
[208:14.71]It doesn't happen without them.
[208:19.12]Also, there's so many people to thank.
[208:20.54]We're not going to have that much opportunity to thank everybody, but seriously, I'm going to take the opportunity now.
[208:24.96]But seriously, if you're into cryptocurrency, if you want to learn more about the space, this is a great place to start.
[208:30.98]And they gave us a significant amount of capital to make this show happen.
[208:34.03]So thank you, Coinbase.
[208:35.95]Thank you, Twitch.
[208:37.21]Also, while I have a second here, because this is the finale, JK Productions, Community Jake,
[208:45.00]This is impossible without these people.
[208:47.79]Andy Mark, Ghost Commander, Criken and his team.
[208:52.09]This went off without a hitch.
[208:55.67]It's seriously like, sure this is the idea that I came up with, but you can't do this without a ton of dedicated people.
[209:02.30]The glass breaking.
[209:04.28]When we did that, Andy Mark, the engineers and Andy Mark came up with all this stuff.
[209:11.21]There's so many people.
[209:12.13]Ludwig, Kit Boga, Milton.
[209:15.37]There's so many people back here that you don't see.
[209:18.19]I wanted just to kind of address it real quick, because I wasn't going to have an opportunity to.
[209:25.19]But again, I want to focus on, there's so many people to thank.
[209:28.41]There's so many people that made this happen.
[209:30.67]But Coinbase, go check them out.
[209:33.41]Please do.
[209:34.67]They gave us so much money to do this.
[209:37.11]And they just wanted to make a good show.
[209:39.39]They wanted to make a good show.
[209:41.59]And I think it has been.
[209:42.53]I think it's been a lot of fun.
[209:44.13]So that's because of Twitch and Coinbase.
[209:47.25]Thank you, both of you.
[209:48.33]We'll go back to the show.
[209:49.61]I've actually used Coinbase, I really have, for five years.
[209:54.36]I mean it.
[209:55.88]And I'll go back to the show.
[209:56.62]Let's break the fourth one.
[209:57.58]What's going on in here?
[210:09.55]I thought that was a bug.
[210:13.75]Hey, how's it going there?
[210:18.76]I don't know if you guys heard anything.
[210:20.98]I was just kind of back there just messing around a little bit.
[210:23.90]We were just talking.
[210:25.12]Yeah, you've got quite a bit of money here.
[210:27.94]You've got quite a bit of money.
[210:30.17]So, hypothetically speaking, we were thinking we could make this whole thing go away.
[210:35.35]Can I hold that?
[210:37.09]Well, yeah, I was talking to Jeb, and I figured we'd just split it, you know, maybe three-way.
[210:42.23]Me, Jeb, and he has actually a dog named Buck.
[210:45.21]You're going to do a three-way split?
[210:47.25]Between the three of us.
[210:48.47]It's in my wall.
[210:49.67]It's in my wall.
[210:50.60]He wouldn't have gotten in.
[210:52.22]Let me count how much money this is.
[210:54.08]I mean, hypothetically speaking, if we would have taken the money and walked away, no one would believe you.
[210:58.76]We were honest.
[210:59.40]We should get honest money.
[211:01.72]It's $1,200.
[211:02.42]That's pretty bad math.
[211:04.28]We counted it when you were gone.
[211:05.32]I got something in your hat.
[211:07.12]I didn't get much beyond the sixth grade, and I can tell you that ain't $1,200.
[211:09.74]From what you've done, blue-collar-wise, you seem slow.
[211:19.13]What?
[211:20.13]You know, the painting.
[211:22.15]You seem a bit slow.
[211:23.60]I'm very fast.
[211:24.32]Let me show you.
[211:24.90]Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[211:28.20]That's impressive.
[211:28.78]That's very impressive.
[211:29.66]Admittedly, nothing to do with blue collar.
[211:31.60]That'd be crazy.
[211:32.32]That'd be an OSHA violation just to do that.
[211:34.21]Toy boat, toy boat.
[211:35.11]And I figured out that great white collar.
[211:36.83]So, you know, I got a lawyer friend.
[211:38.99]Okay.
[211:39.33]I just call him in.
[211:40.37]We just square it away.
[211:41.55]He's got a guy.
[211:42.09]I don't know why we need law in this.
[211:43.92]This is literally my house.
[211:44.86]I mean, what do you want?
[211:45.44]You want me to just give you a hundred bucks and I'll give you a hundred bucks.
[211:48.44]Zero chance.
[211:49.48]My fee?
[211:50.14]Yeah.
[211:50.54]It's not a, it's not flat.
[211:52.60]It's percentage based.
[211:54.04]And then there's a finder.
[211:54.88]There's a finder's fee.
[211:56.06]A finder's fee because I found it.
[211:57.40]Let me just call him up.
[211:58.37]Go ahead and call him.
[211:59.81]Let me just call him up.
[212:00.79]Oh.
[212:01.21]Oh.
[212:01.77]Finders fee.
[212:02.51]My giant dollars of bills.
[212:04.09]Call your lawyer.
[212:05.29]Sure.
[212:05.69]Get a lawyer in here.
[212:06.85]You realize you never would have found the money if it ain't for us.
[212:09.67]Is this Stevenson, Stevenson, Stevenson and Randy?
[212:13.42]You should get a lawyer down here.
[212:15.86]Weirdo at 985.
[212:16.40]Why don't we just take this and put it like... Yeah, there's beer here.
[212:21.68]That ain't your money.
[212:22.42]That ain't your money.
[212:23.14]You might want to put it down there.
[212:24.18]But yeah, if you could just come down.
[212:26.28]We just got a dispute, really.
[212:29.18]You mind if I have some of this bread?
[212:30.60]Go ahead, have a piece of bread.
[212:31.56]Yeah, he's being kind of a dick.
[212:33.48]Yeah.
[212:35.02]So, I don't know if we can just figure that out.
[212:36.60]That'd be great.
[212:37.54]I'll see you in a bit.
[212:39.24]Is that all you got in this house is bread?
[212:40.78]This bread, this mac and cheese up there, but it takes a while to make.
[212:43.58]Forget it.
[212:44.16]Could go for a homemade cookie.
[212:45.60]Yeah.
[212:46.72]Just eat a cookie if you want.
[212:49.98]So, you know a guy.
[212:51.68]He knows about finder's fees.
[212:52.84]He knows about your percentage.
[212:55.70]Oh!
[212:55.80]I'm so tired.
[212:57.30]Get the door.
[212:58.64]by my house.
[212:59.30]We're doing everything for him.
[213:00.68]He's like, he doesn't do a lot of work around here.
[213:01.92]And he wants to keep the money.
[213:04.54]Hey!
[213:05.26]Hey, man, you see that over there?
[213:06.30]Hey, how you doing, buddy?
[213:07.48]Hey, how's it going?
[213:08.24]Come on in.
[213:08.80]Come on in.
[213:10.78]Wow, this is quite the establishment you got here.
[213:13.77]Yeah, well, it's not mine.
[213:14.77]It's this guy's.
[213:16.49]Hey!
[213:16.67]Hey, how's it going?
[213:17.99]Hey, oh, I know you.
[213:19.41]You're on the same softball team.
[213:20.91]Oh, that's right.
[213:21.63]Hey, who's this?
[213:22.37]Is this the homeowner?
[213:23.91]This is the homeowner.
[213:25.17]He's a bit erratic, a bit...
[213:27.19]I just don't think he's mentally fit enough to be able to handle the situation.
[213:31.46]Well, nice to meet you, buddy.
[213:32.70]Hey, it's Bob, Doug, Stevenson, part of Stevenson, Stevenson, Stevenson, and Randy.
[213:39.18]It's been a long day.
[213:39.82]I'm tired.
[213:40.45]Okay, well, hey, I'm here from the property management law firm of Stevenson, Stevenson, Stevenson, and Randy.
[213:46.35]Yep.
[213:46.83]And I was called down here.
[213:47.97]Well, first of all, this is quite an honest place you got here.
[213:50.83]Just want to let you know a couple of things.
[213:52.33]Zone-in routes that we have.
[213:53.41]It ain't that great.
[213:54.05]No, that's not why you're here.
[213:56.54]Okay, alright.
[213:57.20]Now listen, what's the pickle we got ourselves into?
[214:00.06]I got $50,000 in.
[214:00.62]It was in my wallet.
[214:02.14]$50,000.
[214:02.42]They want money.
[214:03.52]Okay, so here, let me get it right.
[214:05.52]He was stealing my electricity for a significant amount of time.
[214:08.56]I want to make that very clear.
[214:09.58]The only reason I was in this establishment is because he stole my electricity.
[214:12.73]Back in my day, we called that thievery.
[214:14.37]Oh, thievery, 100%.
[214:16.15]100%.
[214:16.17]That's a sin.
[214:17.23]That's in the Bible.
[214:18.25]Then I called my guy here.
[214:19.83]I called my guy.
[214:20.53]So it was a finder's fee for me.
[214:21.89]I think that's legal.
[214:22.75]I think that's legalese for I get money.
[214:24.63]That's right.
[214:25.07]I called my guy.
[214:26.37]He takes care of everything.
[214:27.53]Right, he takes care of it.
[214:28.25]I mean, look at him.
[214:28.85]He can take care of anything.
[214:29.87]You know what I'm saying?
[214:30.59]Ain't that the truth, eh?
[214:31.27]If you lock, I'll open it, you know?
[214:33.15]I don't know the slogan yet, but we were shopping that one.
[214:36.24]My wife was saying the same thing.
[214:37.52]She said, they're locksmiths.
[214:38.94]Shut up!
[214:40.10]Fake.
[214:41.56]So what are we doing here?
[214:42.72]This is what we're dealing with.
[214:44.08]Well.
[214:44.80]We need to disperse the money.
[214:45.66]Okay, so you found this money.
[214:46.92]I found it safe inside of the room up there.
[214:48.72]Okay.
[214:48.84]And it's fucking, it was Smithy Granite.
[214:50.60]Well, now, you say we found the money.
[214:53.74]So you mean it wasn't just you who found the money?
[214:57.05]Which one of these?
[214:57.71]He found it and he helped.
[214:59.55]I mean, I found it, 100%.
[215:00.83]Okay.
[215:02.31]At least nine tenths of the law.
[215:05.89]Possession is nine tenths.
[215:06.94]Have you ever heard possession is nine tenths of the law?
[215:09.28]Did he just fall asleep?
[215:12.98]Hey.
[215:14.60]Is he literally sleeping right now?
[215:16.69]Is that... Does that mean he doesn't want the money, you think?
[215:19.69]Is that legal for... Maybe we'll just... Okay, here.
[215:23.74]I'll tell you what we're going to do, okay?
[215:25.88]This is a little bit above my pay grade.
[215:27.69]I'm going to have to go in.
[215:29.91]I think maybe what we should do...
[215:33.41]is give him some equal representation.
[215:34.99]I'm going to call another lawyer in, okay?
[215:36.91]Why don't we do that?
[215:37.75]Yeah, sounds great.
[215:38.63]Would you like a lawyer?
[215:39.67]Yes.
[215:40.17]I'll call a lawyer for you, okay?
[215:41.73]Yes, I would.
[215:42.47]Alright, just give me one second here, okay?
[215:44.45]Take a quick nap or something.
[215:46.21]Yeah, I'd like a lawyer for me.
[215:48.19]Alright, I'll get there for you.
[215:49.59]This guy has no clue what he's doing.
[215:51.19]Yeah, he's a bit distraught.
[215:52.17]Yeah, it's Bob, Doug.
[215:54.81]Huh?
[215:56.21]Yeah.
[215:57.43]Yeah, we got...
[215:59.55]I'm going to make you some bread.
[216:00.99]Oh, please.
[216:02.91]You can't just walk around my house.
[216:04.39]You want a beer?
[216:06.16]You see what we're doing right now?
[216:07.50]Maybe a soda?
[216:08.26]Yeah, I'll take a soda.
[216:16.18]You can't just walk around.
[216:17.16]He's got a half-eaten piece of bread just sitting there.
[216:19.54]I appreciate that.
[216:22.43]Thank you.
[216:22.97]You might want to microwave that and give it a little bit of flavor.
[216:25.67]Yeah, of course.
[216:27.15]Can you microwave this?
[216:28.63]Yeah, I would not do that, actually.
[216:31.74]Get Doug Bob over here as soon as you can.
[216:33.50]That's all good.
[216:34.96]You can have bread.
[216:36.44]Of course it's bread.
[216:37.96]Okay, we got someone coming in who's gonna give you your representation.
[216:40.98]I thought you were a lawyer.
[216:42.34]Listen, I am here on behalf of Locksmith and Jebediah, okay?
[216:45.92]Jebediah and I go way back.
[216:47.38]Get in.
[216:48.04]Get in, get in, get in.
[216:49.80]Get in, get in.
[216:53.81]DOORS OPEN.
[216:54.67]OPEN THE DOOR.
[216:55.21]IT'S NOT BAD.
[216:56.37]IT'S NOT BAD.
[216:57.21]IT'S NOT BAD.
[216:57.95]HI, HELLO.
[216:58.53]I'M DOUG Bob STEVENSON.
[216:59.61]I'VE SEEN STEVENSON, STEVENSON, STEVENSON, AND Randy.
[217:01.85]HOW ARE YOU?
[217:02.33]HI, I'M YOUR REPRESENTATION.
[217:04.01]MINE?
[217:04.51]YES.
[217:05.59]RIGHT?
[217:06.03]THAT'S CORRECT.
[217:06.69]YES.
[217:06.99]YOU WILL BE REPRESENTING THE HOMEOWNER?
[217:08.31]UH-HUH.
[217:08.89]YEP.
[217:09.17]GOOD.
[217:09.57]THIS WILL GO WELL.
[217:10.19]WHY THE HELL DOES HIS REPRESENTATIVE HAVE A BIG BOOK AND YOU GOT A DUMB HAT?
[217:13.89]OKAY.
[217:14.99]I DON'T APPRECIATE THAT.
[217:16.09]WE'RE GOING TO BE RESPECTFUL OF ALL LAWYERS IN THE HOUSE.
[217:17.93]I COMPLIMENTED YOU, FIRST OF ALL.
[217:19.69]WELL, I DO APPRECIATE THAT, BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE RESPECTFUL.
[217:22.77]My big book is underneath the hat, huh?
[217:25.70]Right there.
[217:26.20]Okay, that's not bad.
[217:27.10]So what, you're my lawyer?
[217:28.52]That's not bad at all.
[217:29.38]Okay, so he came in.
[217:31.08]Hi, my name's Jeb.
[217:32.74]I'm the one who found the money.
[217:34.30]Excuse me, excuse me.
[217:35.16]I found the money, so.
[217:36.26]Excuse me, Jeb.
[217:37.50]And then my guy came.
[217:39.51]I'm going to go ahead and ask.
[217:41.11]Can she do that?
[217:41.97]I like that.
[217:42.65]I don't think she's allowed to do that.
[217:43.93]No, I'm just going to let him introduce you guys.
[217:47.63]Can you please step in here?
[217:49.25]Listen, things are getting a little heated here, okay?
[217:51.30]I understand.
[217:52.18]Let's all just step back for a minute.
[217:53.86]So, they found some money behind a wall.
[217:56.64]I found the money.
[217:57.84]Plural.
[217:58.28]They all?
[217:58.74]The three of them.
[218:00.36]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[218:02.88]Technically speaking, technically speaking, I found the money.
[218:06.85]I did all the work.
[218:07.93]Did I not do all the work up there?
[218:10.19]We split the work.
[218:11.19]We're talking.
[218:11.63]What type of work did you do?
[218:13.01]What type of work?
[218:14.15]Handyman work.
[218:15.76]We painted the wall pink.
[218:16.76]Listen to me, you shitty idiot.
[218:20.68]Everybody in this room is a stupid, shit idiot.
[218:24.51]Sir, you're as stupid as the rest of us.
[218:26.27]Defamation.
[218:27.27]You're dumb, too.
[218:27.97]You're dumb.
[218:28.53]You're dumb.
[218:29.09]Defamation.
[218:29.61]Where'd the other one go?
[218:30.51]Slander.
[218:31.09]Okay, you know what?
[218:31.89]You're wearing sunglasses inside.
[218:34.07]Check them off.
[218:35.32]It's Claudia.
[218:36.50]I'm fucking an idiot.
[218:38.40]I'm calling Michelle.
[218:40.02]What do you mean, call who?
[218:41.30]I'm calling in an additional lawyer because you're dumbass.
[218:44.02]I don't want any more lawyers.
[218:45.88]Hey, Michelle.
[218:46.96]You're wearing glasses inside.
[218:48.24]What are you, fucking Tommy Wiseau?
[218:49.92]It's the only guy that can fucking pull that off.
[218:52.99]Where's the rest of it?
[218:55.43]What happened to the rest of it?
[218:57.53]If you could just get over here.
[218:58.85]Look at these splits.
[219:00.13]Derek, give me that.
[219:01.43]Possession is non-tensor.
[219:03.05]Possession.
[219:04.19]Possession.
[219:04.47]Oh, what a spin.
[219:06.45]Spin that one.
[219:07.60]Give me that one.
[219:08.92]Holy hell.
[219:11.20]How's that violin fiction?
[219:12.68]Okay, so technically, if he has possession, does that mean that he... I'm hiding this under the fucking mattress.
[219:18.68]Everybody in this room has 30 IQs.
[219:22.11]Hide that, so you're suggesting that I see that.
[219:24.53]Don't let anybody see that.
[219:25.53]You don't have to take it out of his hand, but if he sets it down somewhere, you know...
[219:28.97]I will give you a percentage.
[219:30.47]Hello?
[219:30.79]You asked for Michelle?
[219:33.23]Yes, another lawyer.
[219:34.27]I think that was my pay.
[219:35.15]I got the stool samples mixed up.
[219:36.29]So wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[219:37.99]Let me get Michelle.
[219:39.37]Let me get Michelle.
[219:40.38]I'm so glad you're here to help me.
[219:42.04]So you're?
[219:44.30]You're their lawyer.
[219:45.90]You're my lawyer.
[219:46.94]And that's your lawyer.
[219:48.30]Correct.
[219:48.80]Yep.
[219:49.12]That's correct.
[219:49.70]Michelle Stevenson of Stevenson, Stevenson, Stevenson, and Randy.
[219:52.32]That's right.
[219:52.84]Pleasure.
[219:53.32]Michelle Stevenson, Bob, Doug Stevenson, Doug, Bob Stevenson of Stevenson, Stevenson, Stevenson, and Randy.
[219:57.78]I hate everybody in this room.
[219:58.80]I hope they all would go home.
[219:59.58]Well, sir, that's unbecoming.
[220:00.56]You are on a stool.
[220:01.00]It's a legal thing.
[220:06.46]It is not.
[220:06.98]Alright, now, listen.
[220:08.16]We got to get to the bottom of who's... Are you going to catch me up?
[220:11.10]I have to.
[220:11.56]You're going to catch me up?
[220:13.10]What's going on here?
[220:14.11]I'm not helping at all.
[220:15.21]You've seen, like, you're called like your siblings.
[220:17.31]I'm with this guy.
[220:18.45]This gentleman and this gentleman in the locksmith help.
[220:21.19]Sure, yeah.
[220:22.47]I deserve paid.
[220:23.33]Sounds like they all need something.
[220:26.67]How is he going to get it if we put it back in the safe?
[220:29.41]I can tell.
[220:30.87]Under the bed.
[220:32.83]Under the bed.
[220:34.35]I can see it right here.
[220:35.87]Are things getting carried?
[220:37.39]I'm going to have to call Randy.
[220:38.89]I'm going to have to call Randy.
[220:40.51]He's going to be real mad.
[220:41.51]I'm going to have to call Randy.
[220:43.07]This is absurd.
[220:44.07]It's alright.
[220:44.59]Don't worry about it.
[220:52.09]You can type on your cell phone.
[220:52.99]I don't want another lawyer.
[220:54.45]You've got two stools.
[220:55.21]You are quite tall.
[220:56.55]Hey, hypothetically speaking, can I borrow that book?
[221:00.31]Oh, honey.
[221:01.53]Get him on the way.
[221:04.15]Great.
[221:04.73]Hey, your shoe's untied.
[221:06.95]Oh, these are zippers.
[221:08.14]I've got zippers on my shoes.
[221:10.28]I don't know how to tie my shoes.
[221:13.14]Thank you very much.
[221:17.30]Is eating the middle of bread without eating the crust a fucking offendable offense?
[221:33.81]I think it is.
[221:34.45]Well, it is disgusting.
[221:36.39]It is not illegal.
[221:37.39]Which one of you did that?
[221:38.49]Probably... I wonder if I could take a quick guess.
[221:41.51]Could I see what you got in your hand there, Mr. Locksmith?
[221:43.90]Let's take a quick little look.
[221:45.00]I mean, he's a great locksmith.
[221:46.44]Oh, Mommy, cut the cross off, Mommy.
[221:48.56]He is a great locksmith.
[221:49.28]Cut the cross off.
[221:49.76]We never said he knew how to... Cut the cross off, Mommy, right?
[221:52.40]I hate the cross, too.
[221:53.40]Cut the cross off, Mommy.
[221:55.86]Fucking loser.
[221:56.60]Should I settle down?
[222:00.26]I think you should try and settle down.
[222:01.46]You should also conserve some energy.
[222:02.98]Maybe if you just had a seat real quick.
[222:04.98]Okay.
[222:05.32]Why don't we just have a seat real quick?
[222:06.44]Hey, Jerma.
[222:07.47]Fuck you.
[222:08.55]How do you know that's my name?
[222:09.65]Oh, God.
[222:09.93]Oh, Lord.
[222:10.21]Oh, God.
[222:13.92]WHO IS THAT?
[222:15.12]WHO IS THAT OVER THERE?
[222:16.84]NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU IN THE MIDDLE.
[222:18.08]HELLO, Randy.
[222:18.80]HELLO, Randy, THANK YOU.
[222:19.96]WHAT WAS IN THE DOOR?
[222:21.92]HI, WHO ARE YOU?
[222:23.48]Randy.
[222:24.32]YOU'RE Randy.
[222:25.20]STEPHENSON, STEPHENSON, STEPHENSON AND Randy.
[222:27.50]OKAY, IT'S A WHOLE FAMILY.
[222:29.30]WHAT WAS IN THE DOOR?
[222:30.90]YES, WE ARE A FAMILY.
[222:32.26]CAN'T YOU TELL?
[222:33.30]SHE'S GOT MY EYES, HE'S GOT MY BUILD AND GETS THE BEARD FROM HIS MOM.
[222:38.19]COME ON.
[222:38.79]LET ME EXPLAIN REAL QUICKLY.
[222:41.21]LET HIM TALK.
[222:41.91]LET HIM EXPLAIN.
[222:43.47]I came into this household.
[222:46.57]I have no expectation of anybody.
[222:48.99]I help the guy out, help his whole room.
[222:51.46]I get my guy to come in.
[222:53.96]He opens the safe, alright?
[222:55.86]He opens the safe.
[222:56.87]He has a fee.
[222:58.69]He has a fee.
[222:59.43]I charge.
[222:59.85]That is an honorable thing.
[223:01.29]Everybody knows that.
[223:02.15]He's got a fee.
[223:02.61]Yeah.
[223:02.85]You understand?
[223:04.05]Send him back.
[223:05.03]We call a lawyer in.
[223:05.71]I don't care how much it costs.
[223:06.51]We call a lawyer in.
[223:07.07]It could be five grand.
[223:08.07]I don't care.
[223:09.47]Ten grand.
[223:10.15]That was me, sir.
[223:10.92]Elvis.
[223:11.12]Elvis.
[223:11.60]Bob Ducks.
[223:12.38]Bob Ducks.
[223:13.10]Yeah.
[223:14.30]Thank you.
[223:14.68]I tried.
[223:15.46]You got the address already.
[223:16.20]Yeah.
[223:16.84]It just caused a fucking ruckus.
[223:18.84]It doesn't matter.
[223:19.72]I mean, pretty much the whole thing could be solved if you just give me the money.
[223:25.21]What's your role in this?
[223:26.29]Well, I open the safe, sir.
[223:27.95]Hey, this is my mom on the phone.
[223:30.08]OK.
[223:31.90]Alright.
[223:33.04]OK.
[223:33.92]Is this normal for you?
[223:36.00]No, it's all good.
[223:36.66]What's the verdict here?
[223:37.68]What's going on?
[223:38.42]What's your role in all this?
[223:39.90]So I was the, well, first of all, I'm the homeowner.
[223:43.62]Why is he opening the door?
[223:45.88]I just opened the door because I feel like it.
[223:47.78]Because I want some fresh air in my home.
[223:50.04]I'm the homeowner.
[223:50.76]The windows are just fine, sir.
[223:52.18]I don't think you want to open that.
[223:56.07]As you're telling me, you should not do that.
[223:58.03]How about you step over here and we get this solved?
[223:59.83]Give me this first.
[224:00.35]Let's just do this.
[224:00.85]Alright.
[224:01.69]So from what I understand, this large sum of money was found in the wall on this property, and you assisted in tearing down the wall, and you assisted in opening the security device in order to obtain the money.
[224:14.39]Is that correct?
[224:14.73]That's good work, Jason.
[224:16.08]Thank you.
[224:16.46]I like that.
[224:16.82]Alright, so here's how, pretty much knowing the law like I know the law because the law is the law and the law is the law.
[224:23.58]This is what we are going to do.
[224:25.20]I know.
[224:25.58]Did I?
[224:25.76]Did I?
[224:26.10]Did I?
[224:32.87]THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO DISTRIBUTE THE MONEY.
[224:36.21]THIS IS HOW IT IS.
[224:37.13]I BELIEVE YOU HAD SOME ELECTRICITY STOLEN FROM YOU, SIR.
[224:41.25]REALLY QUICK, SIR.
[224:42.08]I GOT A QUICK OBJECTION.
[224:43.64]HE MAY HAVE JUST KISSED A BEAR.
[224:46.72]THAT IS A VIOLATION OF THE STATE.
[224:54.21]I would advise you not to.
[224:58.43]I got allergies.
[224:59.38]I'm allergic.
[225:00.26]Only if he is a kind bear.
[225:02.30]No, I'm allergic.
[225:03.20]I got allergies.
[225:04.42]Brady, can I just get my paint?
[225:07.07]Yes, I'm good to go.
[225:09.17]This is how I'm going to rule on this.
[225:10.65]I'll take 5K.
[225:11.09]Alright, so here it is.
[225:12.77]Did you have electricity stolen from you?
[225:14.27]Absolutely not.
[225:14.89]I think if we pay you fair kilowatt hour rates and I think time and also you were doing some handiwork up there.
[225:23.46]Emotional damages.
[225:24.98]Well, were you very happy about this?
[225:27.40]Yes.
[225:27.98]Okay, emotional damages too.
[225:29.96]I think you're allowed that amount.
[225:35.00]I open the safe.
[225:35.78]Where's the bear?
[225:36.74]Did you have to drive all the way over here?
[225:38.64]Yeah.
[225:39.32]And did you have to use tool time in town?
[225:41.44]Yeah, I had to do all those things.
[225:43.76]You know what?
[225:44.24]I think you get that amount.
[225:46.25]Have a good day.
[225:46.91]That's some gorgeous hair.
[225:47.85]Go buy some more hair product, too.
[225:49.27]Why don't you get that taken care of?
[225:50.67]That would be nice.
[225:51.51]Where's the bear?
[225:53.35]I have not seen you two in a while.
[225:55.19]Send the bear back.
[225:56.31]Send the bear in.
[225:57.03]Don't forget to call your mother.
[225:58.43]Okay.
[225:59.23]Make sure you're there tonight for supper.
[226:00.89]Absolutely.
[226:01.47]6 p.m.
[226:01.81]sharp, sir.
[226:02.29]And then I'm going to go ahead and keep this for lawyer Watson.
[226:05.29]Thank you.
[226:05.85]I need the bear to actually open the door this time.
[226:08.39]I think this is done.
[226:09.33]Let's go.
[226:09.67]I need the bear to open the door to the house.
[226:12.61]I don't think I've met you.
[226:18.86]What just happened?
[226:20.26]Why'd they all leave?
[226:20.84]Where's the money?
[226:27.62]Where's the money?
[226:29.40]Why did a bear not come in the house?
[226:31.30]I looked over.
[226:32.68]Okay, I looked over.
[226:33.56]There's a guy with a fucking bear hat.
[226:36.51]It's like human arms.
[226:38.97]How much money did we lose?
[226:40.39]50 grand.
[226:42.71]They took everything.
[226:45.01]There's a guy, they just like didn't plan that.
[226:47.63]A guy with like a big bear head is right here.
[226:52.13]Uh, great.
[226:55.39]A guy came in the house.
[226:59.88]But if you got in the house, you would've like mauled somebody.
[227:03.66]Okay, get that out of my way.
[227:08.02]What?
[227:12.77]I lost 50 and then 15.
[227:15.05]Why do we have to have five lawyers come in?
[227:18.81]Like lawyer, lawyer, lawyer, lawyer, and then the bear comes and just sits in the window and gives me a high five.
[227:23.79]I went like this and he just ran away.
[227:32.37]That safe was in my house!
[227:35.13]Why would that never make any sense?
[227:41.94]Okay.
[227:43.14]Fantastic.
[227:45.56]Fucking dumb.
[227:48.04]It's in the window.
[227:49.66]How would he have gotten in the window?
[227:52.28]How much money do I have left?
[227:53.34]How much money is left in the bank?
[227:58.29]We're good.
[228:00.03]We're good.
[228:01.75]We're good, don't go that way.
[228:03.85]Actually, wait.
[228:07.60]It's this way.
[228:11.12]I wanna see, hold on.
[228:13.80]Let me take the safe out of here.
[228:21.02]No, nevermind, you know what?
[228:22.28]I don't feel like doing that.
[228:23.04]I feel like watching television.
[228:27.43]Yeah, I feel like watching TV.
[228:28.47]That sounds like a better idea.
[228:33.27]I love television, I do.
[228:35.62]Especially this fucked up network.
[228:39.55]which we see all kinds of weird people.

[238:20.63]I CALLED THE POLICE.
[238:21.37]THERE'S A PERSON OUT HERE.

[238:22.93]WHO'S THAT GUY OUT FRONT THEN?
[238:24.09]HE WAS STEALING MY JEWELRY.
[238:25.45]HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE HE HAD NOTHING.
[238:26.87]HE DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING.
[238:27.83]YOU DON'T HAVE NOTHING, HE HAD NOTHING.
[238:29.20]WHO STOLE SOMETHING?
[238:33.71]I REALLY DON'T APPRECIATE YOU WAKING ME UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO COME DOWN HERE BECAUSE YOU GOT NOTHING AND HE'S GOT NOTHING.
[238:40.10]IT'S A COMPLETE WASTE OF TAXPAYER'S MONEY.
[238:41.96]YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?
[238:44.30]I DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY.
[238:46.02]IT SEEMS LIKE YOU THINK IT'S SOME KIND OF JOKE.
[238:47.36]NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S A JOKE.
[238:51.80]Okay, hold on a second.
[238:52.62]Hold on.
[238:52.95]Let me get this other guy.
[238:53.81]I don't know what's... What other guy?
[238:55.63]I thought I saw someone around.
[238:57.45]That's the person that is in the house, officer.

[239:02.13]Are you still out there?
[239:04.38]LISTEN, I DON'T THINK YOU... DID YOU COME ACROSS A PERSON HERE?
[239:06.62]CAN YOU PROVE TO ME THAT SOMETHING HAS BEEN STOLEN?
[239:09.61]IT LOOKS LIKE YOU LITERALLY WOKE UP FROM, LIKE, A TERRIBLE NIGHTMARE, AND THERE'S JUST... YOU DON'T EVEN TAKE CARE OF THEM, PLEASE.
[239:15.79]WHAT HAS BEEN STOLEN FROM YOUR HOUSE?
[239:17.57]I GOT A MASSIVE HEADACHE.
[239:19.41]WHAT HAS BEEN STOLEN?
[239:20.31]I DON'T KNOW.
[239:20.79]I HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK.
[239:21.63]I DON'T KNOW.
[239:22.20]SOMEBODY BROKE IN THE HOUSE, AND THEY WERE ATTACKING ME.
[239:23.62]THEY SHOT ME WITH A SQUARE GUN.
[239:24.78]YOU WANT TO LOOK THROUGH THE HOUSE?
[239:25.84]YOU WANT TO LOOK THROUGH THE HOUSE REALLY QUICKLY?
[239:27.02]YES.
[239:27.60]YES.
[239:28.04]I DON'T KNOW.

[239:29.46]OKAY.
[239:29.72]YOU GIVE
[239:32.64]Do you feel safe right now?
[239:34.72]No, I don't.
[239:35.58]With you here, I don't either.
[239:36.76]Okay, you don't feel safe with me?
[239:38.13]Well, hey.
[239:38.67]No, because I don't think you're going to be doing your job correctly.
[239:40.71]Okay, well, after you.
[239:42.31]Go ahead.
[239:42.89]After you.
[239:43.35]I'm going to have you go first.
[239:44.67]Just double check if there's anyone up there, okay?
[239:47.19]I don't know.
[239:48.33]I heard noises.
[239:50.09]What, you're sleeping?
[239:51.71]I love this uniform on you.
[239:53.82]It's just like something about a police officer uniform.
[239:55.78]It's just sexy to me.
[239:56.74]I really appreciate that.
[239:57.92]I really appreciate you saying that, you know?
[240:00.31]Yeah, I think it looks good on you.
[240:02.55]Looks like you've been working on it.
[240:03.41]Looks like you filled it up, too.
[240:04.79]Oh, yeah, well, I had a lot of years of training, you know.
[240:07.43]Have you been training a lot?
[240:08.73]Oh, yeah.
[240:09.49]I'm the only sheriff in the town, so... I mean, you got these broad shoulders, and, I mean, I love that.
[240:15.13]This looks like a mess.
[240:16.91]Oh, you got a safe.
[240:18.49]Is that what they stole from?
[240:19.41]They stole from the safe?
[240:20.64]They didn't steal a safe.
[240:23.35]I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT EARLIER.
[240:24.37]COME TO THE BEDROOM.
[240:24.85]THIS IS A DISASTER IN HERE.
[240:26.84]YOU GOT TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR PLACE.
[240:28.68]JUST COME IN HERE.

[240:53.89]Is somebody under the bed?
[240:55.45]You look under there.
[240:56.59]I don't.
[240:57.09]That's your job.
[240:57.89]I'm not supposed to do that.
[240:58.85]What are you, three years old?
[241:00.47]Get down.
[241:01.19]Come back downstairs.

[254:20.29]Ugh.
[254:23.23]Ugh.
[254:24.05]My glasses.
[254:26.37]Oh.
[254:40.85]It wasn't even funny the first time I did it.
[254:44.05]Four people probably thought it was funny.
[254:49.75]Okay, what is this?
[255:00.26]Hello, hello, hello.
[255:02.58]Hello, ow, hello.
[255:04.03]Get that off.
[255:07.65]I'm going outside.
[255:13.96]I just don't have any fun.
[255:15.12]I need to get stuff that's fun, not stuff that's, like, practical.
[255:18.49]Get me a fun toy.
[255:19.43]Give me, like, a basketball or something.
[255:21.69]Give me a break.
[255:24.15]How have you not figured out that you need a basketball?
[255:27.87]Oh, look, a mystery box.
[255:32.05]Oh, cool, mystery box.
[255:39.66]There's stools in it, I think.
[255:46.66]Oh, look.
[255:47.90]Good thing you got a mystery box.
[255:52.00]Ow!
[255:54.16]Ow!
[255:55.56]I can't... That's a little better.
[256:17.44]Hey!
[256:20.00]You're in big trouble!
[256:21.22]Aliens!
[256:22.54]Oh, aliens!
[256:24.67]What the heck?
[256:25.63]Aliens!
[256:27.51]That's kind of funny.
[256:35.40]Aliens!
[256:40.06]Oh, aliens!
[256:45.29]Oh, I feel better.
[256:46.61]That's a little fun.
[256:59.39]Good thing you taped it, otherwise we wouldn't know what it was.
[257:05.83]Good thing you taped it.
[257:07.39]Okay.
[257:08.23]It's a bar?
[257:13.34]Alright, alright.
[257:14.32]What can I get you?
[257:15.34]What can I get you?
[257:17.30]Oh, here you go, son.
[257:21.68]Oh, what's that?
[257:26.55]Can I get you over here?
[257:27.47]What can I get you?
[257:28.57]Vodka tonic?
[257:35.97]Fuck off.
[257:37.21]What can I get you?
[257:37.97]Oh.
[257:40.77]Oh, cool.
[257:41.27]There you go.
[257:42.15]I'm having fucking fun.
[257:43.16]I don't want to answer the door.
[257:46.30]No?
[257:47.78]I'm not answering the door.
[257:48.74]This is fun for me.
[257:50.92]This is fun for me.
[257:55.48]Is somebody calling the house?
[258:04.60]Hello?
[258:05.56]Yeah, hey, it's Josh from Car Dealer Warranty Services USA.
[258:09.75]I've been calling you for a couple days now about your extended warranty, but you haven't been returning my calls.
[258:14.71]I was wondering if you had a second to talk about your car, truck, van, maybe your minivan, SUV, anything like that.
[258:22.56]Hello?
[258:22.74]Are you out of your fucking mind?
[258:25.18]Is there someone...
[258:27.12]Are you out of your goddamn mind?
[258:29.20]No, sir, listen, I'm just calling about your car warranty.
[258:32.25]Do you have anything else to do?
[258:34.47]Like, go mow your lawn, go, like, weed your backyard.
[258:37.57]Sir, sir, we actually can insure your mower.
[258:40.03]Do you have a lawnmower, sir?
[258:42.22]Is that something that I can help you with?
[258:43.82]I don't want, I don't have a car.
[258:45.16]Why do you keep calling me?
[258:46.18]Okay, no car.
[258:47.00]Why is this the thing that people do now?
[258:48.88]Do you have a truck?
[258:50.90]I don't have a truck.
[258:51.90]I don't have a car.
[258:53.04]I don't have anything.
[258:53.98]I barely have a trash can.
[258:56.57]Yes, sir.
[258:57.27]Are you sure you don't want a car warranty?
[258:59.79]Are you sure?
[259:00.19]Because your extended car warranty is expired.
[259:02.65]That could be very, very dangerous.
[259:04.63]I could get you in a great policy.
[259:05.47]I'm going to hang up now.
[259:06.11]If you're my front log, I'm going to give you a fist in the face.
[259:08.39]Just letting you know.
[259:09.21]Excuse me?
[259:09.63]Hello?
[259:21.45]What the fuck is he doing?
[259:34.66]I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
[259:35.54]I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
[259:36.22]I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
[259:37.06]I REALLY REACHED YOU ABOUT YOUR CAR'S EXTENDED WARRANTY.
[259:39.00]IS THIS THE HOMEOWNER?
[259:40.06]GET OUT OF HERE.

[260:18.60]I'M JUST SAYING, I GOT HAIR.
[260:20.40]YOU KNOW THE BEAR?
[260:21.14]I GOT BIG, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BEAR?
[260:22.63]WE DO INSURE BEARS.
[260:23.79]DO YOU NEED A BEAR INSURANCE?
[260:28.45]I WOULD HAVE TO CHECK WITH CORPORATE, BUT I WOULD BE WILLING TO BET, SO JUST SIGN RIGHT THERE.
[260:32.35]YOU WANT MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER?
[260:33.51]SURE, SOCIAL SECURITY.
[260:35.57]OKAY, MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IS 11111111.
[260:39.93]THAT SOUNDS PRETTY FAKE, BUT I GET A COMMISSION EITHER WAY, MAN, SO GO AHEAD.
[260:43.26]CAN I ASK WHAT THE COMMISSION IS?
[260:44.92]NOPE.
[260:45.78]THANK YOU.
[260:46.66]YOU GOT TO JUST, RIGHT THERE.
[260:48.08]I DON'T WANT TO SIGN.
[260:51.94]THANK YOU.
[260:52.64]LOOK, HOW ABOUT THIS?
[260:53.96]WHAT?
[260:54.38]HOW ABOUT THIS?
[260:54.82]SURE.
[260:55.72]IF YOU HELP ME CLEAN UP THIS HOUSE,
[260:58.53]I WILL SIGN THE DOCUMENT AND YOU CAN TAKE IT AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT.
[261:02.50]YEAH, I'M DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.
[261:03.76]SEE, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I HAVE TO CALL.
[261:05.62]THEY'VE BEEN EXPECTING MY CALL AND I REALLY DON'T WANT TO LET THEM DOWN.
[261:08.22]WHEN YOU CALL PEOPLE AND YOU ANNOY THE FUCK OUT OF THEM AND YOU ANNOY THEM ALL DAY AND THEY HATE ANSWERING YOUR CALLS, DO YOU THINK IT'S NOT WORTH LIKE FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR TIME TO CLEAN MY CASE?
[261:18.41]I DON'T EXPERIENCE THE SAME THING YOU DO.
[261:20.63]YOU DON'T.
[261:21.11]YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IS COMPLETELY MADE UP.
[261:24.11]SO JUST SIGN RIGHT THERE.
[261:25.65]INTERESTING.
[261:26.81]IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.
[261:28.25]IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.
[261:31.61]IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.
[261:32.25]DO YOU EVER HEAR ABOUT HIPPA LAWS?
[261:33.70]HIPPA?
[261:33.84]NO.
[261:34.04]I'M PRETTY SURE I HAVE INSURANCE FOR THAT.
[261:35.62]IT'S LIKE A MEDICAL THING.
[261:36.56]YOU HAD A PARTY OR SOMETHING?
[261:38.78]I DON'T KNOW.
[261:39.92]LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
[261:41.46]IF THERE IS GOING TO BE A PARTY, I COULD HELP YOU CLEAN UP.
[261:45.58]MAYBE I COULD SELL SOME INSURANCE.
[261:58.08]I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO COME OVER NOW AND BRING YOUR CLAWS.
[262:06.06]I DO SELL REFRIGERATOR INSURANCE AND WARRANTIES.
[262:10.38]I'M GOING TO GET SOME MORE PAPERWORK FOR YOU, OKAY, MAN?
[262:16.23]BY THE WAY, THERE'S SOMEBODY IN A PINK SHIRT, NOT THE BLACK SHIRT.
[262:24.25]A house warranty?
[262:27.09]Yeah, someone in a pink shirt.
[262:28.51]It's kind of like lavender.
[262:30.47]Yeah, they're here now.
[262:32.81]Red?
[262:33.31]Just don't go off the person in the black shirt.
[262:35.27]Black and gray.
[262:37.57]Correct.
[262:37.99]Sounds good.
[262:38.57]Okay.
[262:39.81]Sounds good.
[262:42.31]Hey, how are you?
[262:46.39]What's up, man?
[262:47.01]How are you?
[262:47.49]I've been waiting for you to call me back.
[262:49.73]Yeah, so I...
[262:52.28]I WOULD ACTUALLY PREFER TO DO THIS OVER THE PHONE IF THAT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU.
[262:55.61]I FEEL A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE NOT HAVING IT BE OVER THE PHONE.
[262:58.73]EVEN IF YOU JUST HELD IT.
[262:59.61]YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO CALL ME.
[263:02.85]SO IF YOU COULD JUST SIGN ON THE LINE, THAT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL GREAT.
[263:08.11]THE BOTTOM ONE HERE?
[263:10.99]I DON'T LIKE WHEN PEOPLE TAKE MONEY FROM PEOPLE THAT DON'T DESERVE TO GET STUFF TAKEN FROM THEM FOR NO REASON.
[263:15.27]THIS PROTECTS YOU FROM ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO YOUR CAR.
[263:18.33]I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO PUT A HOUSE WARRANTY ON THERE FOR YOU.
[263:20.89]YOU GOT A HOUSE WARRANTY NOW.
[263:22.33]PHONE WARRANTY.
[263:23.19]THIS COVERS EVERYTHING.
[263:24.47]THANK YOU.
[263:24.73]THANKS.
[263:24.93]I APPRECIATE THAT.
[263:26.44]IS THIS FAKE?
[263:27.60]NO, THAT'S A REAL SIGNATURE.
[263:28.60]EITHER WAY, I GET THE COMMISSIONER.
[263:29.62]I'M GOING TO HANG THE PHONE OFF BECAUSE IT'S WEIRD.
[263:34.66]You're not invited to it, but if there is a party, you would never be invited.
[263:38.18]You're sleazeball.
[263:39.36]Okay, man.
[263:39.76]I appreciate you.
[263:41.74]No, don't go, because you need to get mauled.
[263:44.90]Excuse me?
[263:45.62]You have a maul?
[263:47.64]Have you seen the maul?
[263:49.08]Where is that?
[263:49.52]Have you seen the maul?
[263:50.22]There's a beautiful maul that's down the street.
[263:52.46]Do you need a warranty for that?
[263:55.04]I could use a warranty for you because eventually you might not make it.
[263:58.78]I actually might be able to sell you a warranty against me calling.
[264:04.98]That is actually a really good business.
[264:06.74]Can I ask why you call so much?
[264:08.92]It's my job.
[264:09.98]It's your job.
[264:10.48]But why do you call so much, like every four hours?
[264:13.12]Well, there's actually a sweet old lady who loves taking my calls.
[264:17.53]Literally, we just talk all the time.
[264:21.09]These aren't real.
[264:23.14]THESE AREN'T REAL.
[264:23.70]HE'S LYING ABOUT THAT, TOO.
[264:25.32]THEY ARE GLASSES.
[264:28.08]THERE'S GLASS FRAMES IN HERE, NOT EVEN REAL.
[264:31.96]DID I EVER TELL YOU THAT I WORE PRESCRIPTION GLASSES, Jerma?
[264:36.08]YOUR NAME IS Jerma, RIGHT?
[264:40.06]THAT IS THE HOMEOWNER.
[264:41.30]THAT'S WHAT I WROTE ON THE PAPER.
[264:43.20]I WROTE jermaOn THE PAPER.
[264:45.04]OKAY.
[264:46.20]LISTEN, I TELL YOU WHAT.
[264:48.72]I could probably do something about that.
[264:50.44]I could quit my job.
[264:52.52]I could quit my job if you help me out.
[264:54.40]Hey, go ahead and go in.
[264:59.53]I'm in there if you want.
[265:00.49]It's all up to you.
[265:03.94]Hey, there.
[265:05.20]Okay, there.
[265:06.46]If you want anything, there's some food here.
[265:09.58]Okay.
[265:10.76]Alright.
[265:11.85]Okay, okay.
[265:12.83]Can you help me, please?
[265:17.97]Yes, sure, I'll sign it.
[265:19.93]I'll sign for it.
[265:21.77]I'll sign for it.
[265:23.25]Yeah, there it is.
[265:24.29]There's a signature.
[265:25.23]I love my tongue.
[265:26.67]Hey, bear.
[265:27.41]Hey, bear.
[265:28.85]It really doesn't feel good, though.
[265:32.59]It really doesn't feel good.
[265:36.40]It doesn't feel good.
[265:37.76]Thank you.
[265:38.48]Thank you, bear.
[265:41.06]Thank you.
[265:42.70]You know how to get out.
[266:13.16]THAT'S JUST A DEMONSTRATION OF HOW GOOD OUR WARRANTIES ARE.
[266:20.29]I ACTUALLY HIRED THAT GUY.
[266:23.65]CAN I GET YOU TO SIGN?
[266:25.33]I ALREADY SIGNED IT.
[266:27.43]YOU CAN TAKE IT.
[266:28.21]ALRIGHT, MAN.
[266:29.47]HEY, THANK YOU.
[266:31.29]YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
[266:32.43]VERY GOOD DEMONSTRATION.
[266:39.21]I'll give you a call, okay?
[266:40.23]Thank you.
[266:41.09]I will not answer if you call ever again.
[266:45.40]You know how long it takes to get somebody in a bear costume?
[267:00.02]It takes about five to ten minutes.
[267:07.07]He couldn't find the door.
[267:08.55]He got stuck over in the corner.
[267:11.07]That was fucking crazy.
[267:14.83]Oh my god, I'm going to pee.
[267:22.18]Oh look, a mystery box.
[267:23.50]I'm going to pee my pants if it's not sorted out soon.
[267:42.96]I just remember scrambling backstage.
[267:47.18]Given the bear costume.
[267:55.38]I have to pee so bad.
[268:00.99]I'll call a friend over, okay?
[268:07.45]Who am I calling over?
[268:17.31]I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS NOW.
[268:18.63]I HAVE MET A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS WEIRD NEIGHBORHOOD.
[268:21.68]A LOT OF INTERESTING CHARACTERS HERE.
[268:28.58]WHERE IS THE PHONE?
[268:34.16]THERE IT IS.
[268:46.05]I don't know who I'm talking to, but I'd love for you to come over.
[268:51.23]I'd like to invite over... I'd like to invite over... Hey, they can bring, by the way, they can bring a plus one.
[269:08.20]I'd like Edna to come over with a plus one.
[269:15.19]AND IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
[269:15.99]I HOPE THE PLUS ONE IS DEATH, BY THE WAY.
[269:20.23]I'D LIKE DEATH TO COME OVER WITH EDNA.
[269:22.29]PLEASE.
[269:23.43]THANK YOU.
[269:28.41]GOOD LUCK BACKSTAGE.
[269:33.18]BECAUSE NOW THEY GOT TO GO ALL OVER THAT.
[269:36.50]HOW ABOUT WE GO TO THE BEDROOM?
[269:44.88]THAT WOULD BE EDNA AND DEATH.
[269:47.82]I WANT THEM TO COME OVER.
[269:48.62]I WANT TO HANG OUT WITH THEM.
[269:50.06]I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD BE A FUN TIME.
[269:53.42]MAYBE I WOULD HAVE A PARTY, TOO.
[269:59.49]OKAY.
[270:01.09]GOOD TIME.
[270:02.91]I WANT TO HAVE A PARTY.
[270:07.59]I'M THINKING ABOUT A BIG PARTY.
[270:12.21]BUT IS THE PLACE EVEN READY FOR A PARTY?
[270:23.00]How many people should I invite?
[270:23.92]If I have a party, how many should I invite?
[270:26.98]Everyone?
[270:28.46]I did say that there was a party happening a week ago or so.
[270:34.00]I want to get as many people here as I can.
[270:35.86]Because I want to show everybody that I'm the cool neighbor.
[270:38.38]I've got a cool house.
[270:39.86]I've got a cool party house.
[270:42.04]And I want them to know.
[270:45.04]I'm about to piss in the bed.
[270:45.80]I'm just going to pee in the bed.
[270:48.53]I don't even care if they voted for it.
[270:49.47]I'm peeing in the bed.
[271:08.70]I don't even care.
[271:14.44]They don't have to vote for that, I don't even care.
[271:18.64]This place is a mess though.
[271:19.76]Can I even like do anything up here?
[271:20.94]I can't even move anything.
[271:28.17]This place is a complete disaster.
[271:30.83]It's a disaster.
[271:34.91]Hungry, I need a shower.
[271:38.00]having friends come over.
[271:43.40]God damn it.
[271:46.47]I love the pillow set you gave me, though.
[271:47.91]It's beautiful.
[271:49.95]Can I take a shower?
[271:51.93]Please.
[271:53.31]Look, I pissed my bed.
[271:54.23]That's enough for you to choose shower.
[272:02.18]Thank you.
[272:15.97]I'm just, whatever, I'm throwing this out.
[272:24.20]That's not cup-staining.
[272:27.36]Right.
[272:28.86]It's not staying in it.
[272:34.29]Get me ready for the day.
[272:39.47]Whew.
[272:45.43]Okay.
[272:47.55]Okay, good.
[272:50.07]We farted.
[272:51.14]We farted three times in 15 seconds.
[272:54.26]Great.
[272:59.40]Turn that off.
[273:00.24]Don't do that again.
[273:00.84]If it doesn't fart again, I'm going to be very upset.
[273:04.35]Actually upset about it.
[273:12.71]Oh, it's not there.
[273:13.79]Okay.
[273:20.37]Oh, what an absolute mess.
[273:21.75]I wish I had a maid that could take care of this.
[273:25.99]Oh, Amelia.
[273:31.65]Who opened this?
[273:34.55]I didn't.
[273:39.59]Disgusting.
[273:42.39]Revolting.
[273:46.42]Where's my trash?
[273:51.44]What comes in?
[273:54.82]Can I at least be responsible for this junk?
[273:58.96]It looks horrible.
[274:01.71]All I smell is like beer.
[274:04.33]There's just a beer stench.
[274:13.71]Get rid of this.
[274:16.72]Okay, sit that there, put this back, whatever.
[274:24.21]Good.
[274:25.09]That looks better.
[274:27.47]That is horrible looking.
[274:30.16]There's something about like bit pieces of bread that just annoy me.
[274:35.16]They look, this looks awful.
[274:41.20]Clean up.
[274:43.86]Okay.
[274:44.56]Should I just drink one of these?
[274:48.84]How's that?
[274:49.16]Does it look good?
[274:53.06]Call the what?
[274:54.30]Clean the house?
[274:55.29]I'm trying.
[274:57.61]I'm in the middle of cleaning up the house.
[274:59.49]If people are gonna come over, I want it to be like a dump.
[275:05.15]There.
[275:07.98]Hey, how about some coffee?
[275:08.76]Let's make some coffee.
[275:18.44]On.
[275:19.92]Okay, coffee's brewing.
[275:25.60]Coffee's brewing, I think.
[275:29.54]Is that a horn?
[275:35.89]Wait, what was that?
[275:43.95]I BROUGHT A FEW FRIENDS OVER.
[275:45.65]YOU SAID PLUS ONE AND I IMPROVISED.
[275:48.07]THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE.
[275:49.77]YEAH.
[275:50.81]THAT'S QUITE A FEW PEOPLE.
[275:52.59]YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU SAID PLUS ONE, SO PLUS ONE, PLUS ONE.
[275:57.97]EVERYONE BROUGHT A PLUS ONE.
[276:04.30]Hi.
[276:05.34]How are you?
[276:06.90]Oh, you got some punch.
[276:07.96]I called for Edna and Death to bring a friend.
[276:11.36]Not for every single person to show up.
[276:16.18]Amelia.
[276:16.78]Looks like shit.
[276:18.15]Yeah.
[276:18.79]So you didn't really clean up much.
[276:20.73]No, because you didn't, you haven't been here.
[276:22.73]Yes, I haven't.
[276:27.13]Enjoy the house.
[276:28.89]Hi.
[276:29.11]It's good to see you again.
[276:30.03]Good to see you again.
[276:33.48]Look, if I could just talk, please get away from us.
[276:36.24]I'm trying to talk to him.
[276:37.33]Thank you.
[276:37.93]Thank you very much.
[276:38.61]Get away from him.
[276:39.31]Yeah, he hates fun and happiness.
[276:41.59]Look, I was going to say sorry.
[276:43.11]And keeping promises.
[276:45.12]and say I'm sorry about everything that happened.
[276:47.49]I didn't expect you to come over today because I called two people over, but in this universe, if you call two people over, then ten people come over.
[276:54.53]Oh, so you didn't want me to come today.
[276:55.93]I thought you were going to apologize.
[276:57.15]I mean, I did, but... It was a mistake that I'm here.
[276:59.17]But in the way this game works, when you call someone over, 30 people show up.
[277:05.42]This isn't a game to me.
[277:06.42]Death's got a pizza if you want some.
[277:10.44]You think I want something from him?
[277:14.43]How about you two make more pizza together?
[277:17.21]Okay.
[277:20.03]Just enjoy the house, enjoy the flat.
[277:21.77]Might as well have a party.
[277:22.91]Is this a stereo system?
[277:24.27]Who brought that?
[277:26.53]Should we get some tunes?
[277:27.80]I'm gonna walk around and see what you've done to the place.
[277:30.40]There's no CD in here.
[277:36.76]You want to get some tunes?
[277:38.46]Let's get some tunes going.
[277:40.66]Alright.
[277:43.54]What a depressing life I have.
[277:48.54]OK, cool.
[277:49.04]Well, it looks like everybody's here, which is weird because I actually invited over one person.
[277:58.92]It's actually kind of fun.

[278:04.85]That's what I want to know.

[278:19.47]That's expensive.
[278:20.31]I don't want to have to pay for that.
[278:22.01]You have to pay.
[278:22.61]I don't even know who you are.

[279:16.87]We were not talking about Edna.
[279:19.33]Nothing about Edna.
[279:19.85]What's wrong with Edna?
[279:20.59]She's great.
[279:21.91]She's getting up there a little bit.
[279:23.99]But she's going to die?

[279:41.72]Great.
[279:42.06]I'll see you real soon.
[279:43.53]I would like it if you put that back in your car.
[279:48.59]I thought it was an accessory.
[279:49.89]A banana!
[279:51.65]Alright!
[279:52.31]That's what I'm talking about!
[279:56.05]Alright!
[279:57.67]Yeah, I thought you were a dick before, but now, let me help you.

[280:06.21]Let me just give you a hand here.
[280:08.07]I think I need to zip you up, because you're like underwear showing.
[280:13.10]Let me, like, zip up this costume, because this underwear is showing.
[280:18.76]He's like unzipped.
[280:20.54]I need to zip his costume.
[280:22.30]Stay right there, okay?
[280:23.58]I'm gonna zip you up, if I can find the zipper, wherever it is.
[280:26.65]Of course.
[280:27.65]Oh, it's buttons?
[280:30.17]Who made a costume like this that had buttons?
[280:32.85]Of course, you're a gorilla.
[280:33.83]What am I talking about?
[280:35.29]Pop a squat with me.
[280:36.25]I have a couple questions for you.
[280:37.67]There we go.
[280:38.01]Alright.

[280:39.03]That's all you need.
[280:39.63]That's all you need.
[280:40.21]Have a good time.
[280:40.69]Have a good time with the party.
[280:42.39]Have a good time with the party.
[280:43.21]I don't know.
[280:43.55]I'm just kind of mad at Jeremiah.
[280:44.89]He kind of... Alright.
[280:50.46]That's right.
[280:51.02]Woo!
[280:53.14]Alright.
[280:53.76]Yeah?
[280:55.02]Good time with the party.
[280:55.96]You know, um... This is good shit.
[280:59.30]Any dirt on him so I can get back at him?
[281:10.53]I got it!
[281:11.57]I got it!
[281:12.25]I actually got it!
[281:13.97]It came down!
[281:15.25]Hey!
[281:17.51]I thought someone was calling for me.
[281:19.51]It sounded like heavy machinery being used without protective equipment.
[281:23.38]Yes, it was.
[281:23.90]Take a look.
[281:26.82]I got it down.
[281:27.28]Look.
[281:27.44]See?
[281:27.54]What?
[281:28.76]We were trying to do it, but it lasted four hours.
[281:30.32]Great.
[281:30.84]What?
[281:31.02]No, go ahead.
[281:31.80]Go by.
[281:33.94]That's fine.
[281:38.56]I'm going to get help cleaning up, right?
[281:41.40]Can I hold on to this?
[281:43.40]I mean, we have a really great maid service in town.
[281:46.00]Yes.
[281:47.74]That's great.
[281:48.66]They've been here a few times.
[281:50.31]And downstairs, if you could, that'd be great.
[281:55.87]Yeah, down here is good.
[282:01.17]Down here is good.
[282:01.95]Just make your way over here.
[282:05.37]I got this.
[282:05.89]Beer's in the fridge.
[282:07.89]I might need that.
[282:12.68]Hey.
[282:13.18]Hey.
[282:13.60]Hey, guys.
[282:14.60]Nothing.
[282:14.92]I was just talking to my lawyer friend.
[282:16.64]And he had some interesting information.
[282:20.29]If you wouldn't mind.
[282:21.01]You're talking to the lawyer about what?
[282:24.14]Just some interesting things about this house of yours.
[282:28.19]What's wrong with it?
[282:31.23]I don't feel comfortable.
[282:32.35]I'm not a lawyer.
[282:33.41]What's the party?
[282:33.95]We're having a good time.
[282:35.05]Yeah, looking at the county records and looking at the property maps and things, apparently this house was built on somebody else's property.
[282:43.45]What do you mean somebody built on somebody else's property?
[282:45.97]Somebody else owns this property that this house has been built on.
[282:50.22]Somebody owns this, okay.
[282:51.60]Yeah, so technically...
[282:54.24]It's probably their house, their property.
[282:58.85]How is that even humanly possible?
[283:01.09]I built, this was a house that was built.
[283:04.11]These are the county records that I've obtained.
[283:06.27]Well, how long have you lived here?
[283:08.29]Two, three weeks.
[283:09.25]Not very long.
[283:10.09]Not very long.
[283:10.85]And you're 985?
[283:11.85]Yeah.
[283:12.31]Because I heard someone lived at 983.
[283:13.29]Okay.
[283:13.41]Okay.
[283:18.05]Jerma?
[283:18.63]What do you mean, 983?
[283:19.13]Oh!
[283:19.33]What the?
[283:21.31]What?
[283:22.66]I'm Ludwig.
[283:24.08]What the fuck?
[283:25.44]Yes.
[283:26.04]No, you're not.
[283:26.90]This entire time.
[283:29.68]You've been... No, no, no, no, no.
[283:31.16]We've been talking a lot.
[283:32.14]And the land you built on is 985, and maybe I passed an eye this whole time to your discrepancies.
[283:38.47]What are you talking about?
[283:39.69]No.
[283:40.23]But after I walked in on... Oh, gosh.
[283:44.01]After I walked in on you and that cretin...
[283:47.27]Is he going to be okay?
[283:49.56]Well, I think he'll be fine.
[283:50.92]It's not like he could kill himself.
[283:52.40]Wait, wait, wait.
[283:52.88]Come over here.
[283:53.49]I need to talk to you.
[283:55.48]SHOW HIM THE DEED.
[283:56.34]SHOW ME THE DEED.
[283:56.78]WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
[283:57.72]THIS HOUSE HAS BEEN BUILT.
[283:59.02]WHOSE NAME DOES IT SAY THERE?
[284:00.38]WHOSE HOUSE DOES IT SAY?
[284:01.72]THIS IS 983.
[284:02.14]I'VE BEEN BUILDING.
[284:04.10]I'M IN LUGWIG'S BACK YARD OF 983.
[284:07.68]THIS IS 985 DOES NOT EXIST.
[284:09.50]THIS IS AN OFFICIAL DOCUMENT.
[284:11.37]IT'S ACCURATE.
[284:12.69]HOW DOES IT MAKE ANY SENSE?
[284:13.55]YOU'VE BEEN, AMELIA.
[284:14.85]YOU BUILT ON MY LAND WITHOUT ASKING.
[284:16.95]AND I PASSED THE BLIND EYE BECAUSE I LIKED YOU.
[284:19.29]AND I THOUGHT WE'D GET ALONG GREAT.
[284:20.87]WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
[284:21.57]HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS?
[284:23.09]WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
[284:24.53]You can deal with it pretty simply.
[284:25.81]Deal with it pretty simply?
[284:26.61]It's called get out of the house.
[284:27.99]It's how about you get out of my house?
[284:29.45]No, you get out of my house.
[284:31.07]No, how is it your house?
[284:32.97]Look at this paper.
[284:34.20]Actually, that is a legal document, and Ludwig owns the property and the house.
[284:39.52]What the fuck are you talking about?
[284:41.16]You just got invited over as a party.
[284:43.44]You're my friend.
[284:43.90]The law is the law, and the law is the law.
[284:46.88]No, it's not.
[284:47.56]It doesn't make any sense.
[284:48.59]How about you get the fuck out of my house?
[284:50.76]You don't own this house, and it's built here.
[284:53.82]I own this land.
[284:55.28]985 Dollhouse Way.
[284:56.94]I was having a party, and I invited everybody.
[284:59.71]Actually, I invited two people, but you all showed up, because everybody in this neighborhood does... Well, I thought you wanted to hang out with me, maybe apologize.
[285:05.01]Everybody in this neighborhood does crack, apparently, and everyone's on drugs.
[285:08.13]First thing you said to me when I walked in is you didn't clean the house enough.
[285:11.20]I didn't even know you were Ludwig until you took the mask off.
[285:13.24]Does that matter?
[285:14.70]Does that mean you need to treat me with respect if I'm Ludwig?
[285:17.60]Okay.
[285:18.80]Great.
[285:19.32]Sounds great.
[285:20.22]I can represent you.
[285:20.84]It's impossible for me to.
[285:21.88]That makes no sense.
[285:23.26]Don't log into my account.
[285:24.44]Don't stream on that account either.
[285:27.04]Come on.
[285:27.36]Let's go discuss this.
[285:28.84]No.
[285:29.18]What do you mean evict me?
[285:30.19]I'm kicking him out of this house.
[285:31.37]No one's evicting me.
[285:32.23]This is my property.
[285:33.43]I live here.
[285:33.93]Is the sheriff here?
[285:35.57]No one's evicting me.
[285:37.41]Hey.
[285:38.74]I need your help.
[285:39.62]Ludwig, don't let him stream on my account, please.
[285:42.06]Well, I'm not worried about him streaming on your account.
[285:44.03]Follow me.
[285:45.33]I got banned from... Hey, can you help me?
[285:46.45]I need some muscle.
[285:46.91]Where's the sheriff?
[285:47.47]I can represent.
[285:48.31]Can you represent?
[285:48.85]Yes, I can represent.
[285:49.51]Stevenson, Stevenson, Stevenson, and Randy.
[285:51.43]I'll give you my... I got banned from Twitch last week, and I'm going to need you to help me.
[285:54.20]I can.
[285:54.82]Could you follow me?
[285:55.90]Yeah, I could follow you.
[285:57.04]This is my kitchen.
[285:58.76]Yeah, your kitchen.
[286:03.68]Oh, now you feel bad.
[286:05.86]It's my house!
[286:06.74]It's not even your house!
[286:07.76]It's my house you built on my property.
[286:09.52]Maybe if you treated me nicer, this wouldn't happen this way.
[286:13.16]I don't even know your name!
[286:14.83]Oh, there's the sheriff.
[286:15.67]What do you mean, the sheriff?
[286:16.57]Get off me!
[286:17.07]Where's my bear friend?
[286:18.19]He's the only person I like here.
[286:19.55]Well, he's hopefully not here.
[286:21.65]Oh, that should be the officer right now.
[286:23.37]Thank you.
[286:23.63]That's my door.
[286:24.25]I'll take it.
[286:24.71]Yeah.
[286:26.23]Oh, Sheriff.
[286:26.81]What are you doing?
[286:27.75]I'm trying to help.
[286:28.89]Hey.
[286:29.21]But we've got to follow the law.
[286:30.72]We've got to follow the law.
[286:32.58]He's trespassing.
[286:33.54]What's going on here?
[286:34.34]He's trespassing, and I want him out of my house.
[286:36.52]Who?
[286:36.96]This guy right here.
[286:37.72]You have proof?
[286:38.66]Book him.
[286:39.20]Yeah, I've got proof.
[286:40.30]Let me see it.
[286:41.06]He's the dean.
[286:41.64]It's right there.
[286:42.86]That is a legal document I obtained from Fort Worth.
[286:45.16]Well, what do you think it says?
[286:46.57]Okay, I mean, it says you.
[286:48.09]Well, okay, because it's my property.
[286:49.59]It's your property.
[286:50.47]My property.
[286:51.15]Listen, I'm sorry, man.
[286:52.23]You've got to come with me.
[286:54.05]It's all legal.
[286:54.94]Listen, it's legal.
[286:55.84]Put your hands behind your back.
[286:57.18]No, it's not legal.
[286:58.02]What the fuck?
[286:59.13]Alright.
[286:59.39]Hands behind the back.
[287:00.07]That actually hurt in real life.
[287:01.43]Here you go.
[287:03.49]That's right, Bear.
[287:04.67]Book him, too.
[287:05.69]Alright.
[287:06.27]Alright.
[287:06.55]You're coming with me.
[287:07.45]Alright, Bear.
[287:08.47]Bear, listen.
[287:09.31]Alright.
[287:09.67]Calm down.
[287:10.15]Alright.
[287:10.59]Calm down.
[287:11.53]Boo.
[287:12.45]Fine.
[287:12.79]I'll go.
[287:13.33]Fine.
[287:13.69]What the fuck is this?
[287:14.64]I'm so sorry about this nuisance.
[287:16.02]I'm sorry about that.
[287:16.84]Come on.
[287:17.44]Can you rep for me and just say that I had a really fun party?
[287:21.06]What's wrong with you?
[287:22.14]You're stealing from me.
[287:22.98]Thanks.
[287:23.16]You can keep the punch.
[287:23.80]What's wrong with you?
[287:24.56]Welcome to Lovings Dollhouse.
[287:25.91]Housewarming gift.
[287:26.61]This looks like a cigar hat.
[287:27.83]Let me figure out what it could be.
[287:31.68]That's a great park.
[287:32.92]It's a good time.
[287:33.50]Hey, welcome to Ludwig's Dollhouse.
[287:34.89]Sorry if that hurt.
[287:38.41]Are you spiking the punch?
[287:42.83]Alright.
[287:43.13]You're just going to leave after spike?
[287:49.33]Thank God I'm a maid.
[287:53.55]Alright, my house now.
[287:59.81]Why does it smell like cigar smoke?
[288:10.17]What the zuck happened here?
[288:11.89]Oh, it's terrible.
[288:27.32]Should I call my own maid or am I my own maid?
[288:30.67]Why is there... Okay, I imagine that doesn't belong there.
[288:40.23]Alright, I'll ignore that.
[288:43.41]Still smells like cigar smoke.
[289:00.52]Oh, God!
[289:01.50]I can't clean this!
[289:05.72]How do you even begin to clean this?
[289:08.80]There's no trash can for giant drywall.
[289:16.31]Huh.
[289:21.95]That was covering the paint.
[289:23.49]Okay.
[289:25.49]Right.
[289:26.80]Clean that back up.
[289:29.36]I think the posters are sold out, but we could maybe sell that one and I'll take that cut.
[289:40.50]Oh, fresh-baked cookies.
[289:46.43]Well, that's ugly.
[289:48.21]Ooh.
[289:54.39]This is a fashionable robe.
[290:02.63]Okay.
[290:15.66]It's really wet.
[290:21.38]Okay.
[290:23.48]That's kind of gross.
[290:27.29]Well, that's kind of gross.
[290:30.17]I'll just take the cookies and be gone.
[290:37.35]Having less autonomy is just a living hell.
[290:40.22]Oh, now I get to make the bed.
[290:41.46]Okay.
[290:42.36]That makes a lot of sense.
[290:44.37]Clean and make beds should be symbiotic.
[290:50.78]Do I have to make the piss bed, or can I sleep on the children's bed?
[290:53.20]You know what the worst kind of people are?
[290:59.66]The people who buy sequin pillows and do this.
[291:03.31]Like, what do you think you are, Houdini?
[291:04.75]It's just a pillow.
[291:05.95]Relax.
[291:09.85]Ugh.
[291:26.65]What does he even do all day?
[291:29.89]I'm not gonna bother with this room.
[291:34.75]Jerma must still be home.
[291:36.47]I should kick him out.
[291:50.54]Oh, God.
[291:54.30]Smells like shit in here.
[291:58.12]Right?
[291:59.16]That's... That was the laugh track moment.
[292:04.77]Maybe he had some... It's a little late.
[292:08.43]Shower time.
[292:09.43]Okay.
[292:12.13]How would I do this?
[292:12.89]Let's just... You know, this is not my first time doing this live.
[292:29.36]Okay, no peeping toms.
[292:30.20]You know what the worst thing you can do in a shower is?
[292:39.35]Piss or shit in it.
[292:41.27]It's like other people might use it.
[292:44.81]You know, I'll do it sometimes, but it's still pretty deplorable of me.
[292:50.49]Nothing wrong with pissing as long as you don't shit.
[292:54.21]Alright, that's enough shower.
[292:55.75]That should be... I feel clean enough.
[293:02.86]There it is.
[293:09.95]Is there another maid service in this town, or am I the only maid?
[293:13.72]Why are there so many stools?
[293:21.90]Okay.
[293:25.43]Uh...
[293:37.64]What was the point of kicking out Jerma?
[293:38.90]I have two houses now.
[293:41.60]I could have just charged him rent.
[293:44.46]I mean, at the end of the day, all he asked me to do was just... go on one date.
[293:51.67]It's not like we were dating.
[293:58.61]And he deserved it.
[294:03.16]Whew.
[294:05.08]It's gonna be tiring.
[294:06.82]You know, if someone really wanted to, they could have me take a nice bed.
[294:14.94]I've seen how you make Jerma act.
[294:16.64]You don't have to act the same with me.
[294:17.84]We can have a good relationship, you know?
[294:20.46]Actually follow through with love stories and not just burn them to the ground by having sex with death.
[294:28.05]Just an option, I guess.
[294:43.52]What's the point of parties?
[294:45.46]It's too many people to even have a conversation with.
[294:47.28]Every conversation's dull shit.
[294:49.56]Seven people told me they're gonna go to Japan, but COVID hit.
[294:53.29]I don't give a shit.
[295:01.69]Maybe I should call them back sometime.
[295:07.89]I'm tired.
[295:08.85]Go jogging.
[295:10.59]Go jo- So it doesn't matter who's in the titular role.
[295:15.76]People said, oh no, it's just because it's Jerma that we treat him poorly.
[295:20.40]But perhaps, really, you just treat everyone poorly who comes into this room.
[295:26.66]Even given the Pope, you'd probably still make him go jogging as he's fatigued.
[295:32.87]Who do you treat nicely?
[295:37.92]Oh, hello.
[295:40.77]Are you doing jumping jacks and cigar smoke?
[295:42.83]Is someone ready to get fit?
[295:45.47]Are you ready to go for a run?
[295:47.16]Let's jog together.
[295:47.96]Okay, let's go.
[295:48.60]Come on.
[295:49.76]High knees, get them up.
[295:51.02]Okay.
[295:51.62]There we go.
[295:52.84]We're yummy mummies.
[295:53.81]Okay.
[295:54.41]We're yummy mummies, aren't we?
[295:55.33]Can we turn around?
[295:55.81]Can we turn around?
[295:56.39]I'm a bit tired here.
[295:57.81]Are you winded already?
[295:58.87]I'm just a bit tired.
[295:59.67]Okay, let's do a cool down.
[296:00.77]Come on.
[296:01.15]Just maybe a cool down.
[296:01.99]You're looking great.
[296:03.01]Thank you.
[296:03.41]Knees up.
[296:03.73]Let's go.
[296:04.21]Knees are high.
[296:05.10]Yummy mummies.
[296:05.56]Knees are high while I'm wearing a dress.
[296:06.60]Getting tight in the tummies, aren't we?
[296:08.20]Oh, jeez.
[296:09.02]Oh.
[296:09.80]Uh.
[296:10.86]Uh.
[296:12.16]Uh.
[296:13.08]Ooh.
[296:14.26]It, uh.
[302:52.42]Oh, yeah!
[302:53.72]Christmas!
[302:56.12]Wabba gabba gnoosh!
[302:57.78]This is amazing.
[302:59.72]Is it even Christmas time?
[303:04.07]Hasn't even been much colder, but this is great.
[303:10.95]Wow.
[303:18.90]That doesn't seem festive, but maybe for birthdays.
[303:22.32]Why are there so many cigars?
[303:31.25]Now wait a second, it feels as though... It's a bit short.
[303:39.07]Maybe for the previous tenant.
[303:43.96]Make sense?
[303:48.28]Go back outside!
[303:49.32]Go back outside!
[303:50.34]Okay, good, garden the flowers.
[303:53.92]I feel like I've spent a lot of time in here.
[303:56.80]The flowers.
[303:59.08]These flowers.
[304:01.21]Garden, okay.
[304:03.25]They need rich nutrients.
[304:08.66]And maybe some water.
[304:13.47]Oh, hey.
[304:14.59]How are you?
[304:14.95]I'm looking for, was it Jeremiah or what was his name?
[304:18.87]Jerma.
[304:19.83]What do you have there?
[304:21.19]Well, listen, I felt kind of bad the other day.
[304:23.09]We had a little bit of a run around about something.
[304:25.22]I wanted to give him a hundred bucks, you know.
[304:27.20]Oh.
[304:27.84]You seem really nice.
[304:29.02]Did you?
[304:29.58]Hey.
[304:29.88]Nice to meet you.
[304:30.76]Well, you know what?
[304:33.22]He just left.
[304:34.54]Okay.
[304:35.02]But he said you'd stop by.
[304:36.42]Yeah.
[304:37.07]I want you to know, I really like what you did with the place out here.
[304:40.43]It looks real nice.
[304:41.43]Thank you.
[304:42.01]You picked that yourself?
[304:43.88]Yeah, I would have gone taller, but, you know, how about you come in?
[304:46.30]Okay.
[304:46.60]How about you come in?
[304:47.26]I mean, I didn't want to stay long, so you own the house now?
[304:50.42]Uh, you know what?
[304:51.46]Yeah, I own it, but he comes in and out, so, you know, I'll just hold on to it for you.
[304:55.55]I mean, listen, I was going to give him a hundred bucks.
[304:58.79]And, um... Listen, I'll give you... You know... You know...
[305:05.68]Camo doesn't really work on you because you stick out like a sore thumb with that beautiful body of yours.
[305:12.79]I really appreciate it.
[305:13.77]I'd suggest other clothing.
[305:14.85]I am married.
[305:16.07]Married to the game.
[305:17.07]I am married.
[305:18.39]Physically married.
[305:19.09]I'm just going to give that to you.
[305:23.30]You're a looker, but don't tell nobody I said that.
[305:25.98]If you're ever interested.
[305:29.26]Okay.
[305:30.57]985.
[305:30.85]985.
[305:31.57]Okay.
[305:32.63]And 983.
[305:33.52]I actually own both.
[305:34.48]Okay.
[305:35.22]Yeah.
[305:35.60]I love what you did with the place.
[305:36.58]Thank you.
[305:37.00]You look great.
[305:37.66]Yeah.
[305:38.80]Legal dispute.
[305:39.92]Hey, anytime you need electricity, anytime you need electricity, there's an extension cord already hooked up.
[305:44.18]And I can just use it?
[305:45.04]It's yours.
[305:45.68]Okay.
[305:46.26]That's convenient.
[305:47.26]I feel like it'd be a huge headache.
[305:52.33]Okay.
[305:56.51]Pee-pee, poo-poo, or eat-eat?
[305:58.17]We got to pick one.
[305:59.67]Because right now, it's a little all over the... It seems gross, but they kind of look appealing.
[306:17.70]Oh, I'll clean.
[306:18.46]Yeah, I'll just... This seems to be somewhat stereotypical.
[306:22.44]Feels like we could have respected maybe the job more and been like, oh, maybe that's what they do day to day.
[306:30.33]So perhaps, you know, they could take care of the rest of what they got going on.
[306:36.14]But I'll clean.
[306:37.30]I'll clean.
[306:37.82]I've cleaned this place before.
[306:38.84]Can do it again.
[306:43.91]Admittedly, all the utensils were me, so I can't be too upset.
[306:51.75]What is this, a small pinata?
[306:52.97]Does this have actual pizza in it?
[306:59.08]What?
[307:01.50]Why is it so red?
[307:03.98]How do you get pizza that red?
[307:05.48]Is it made with beets instead of tomatoes?
[307:10.30]It's a week old!
[307:13.29]Why would you put... I would have eaten that.
[307:17.82]Okay.
[307:19.06]I get the white bread thing now.
[307:26.92]There's so much alcohol.
[307:29.84]Does he ever drink water?
[307:31.72]Is there a way to drink water in this house, or is it only unmarked sodas and unmarked beers?
[307:40.45]Oh, um...
[307:41.74]Sorry, I'm not allowed to do that yet.
[307:44.28]But if anyone wanted to feed me, that's what I would do.
[307:48.00]But for now, I'm staying hungry.
[307:50.58]Had someone wanted that to happen, that's what could have happened.
[307:54.65]But we'll never know.
[307:59.91]Well, this room's not bad then.
[308:10.35]I'm anxious just being here.
[308:19.59]I have to work?
[308:21.61]Why am I being called by elven men?
[308:24.99]I'm a maid.
[308:27.41]Is this for the king?
[308:30.67]You know, it's been a pretty long day.
[308:31.90]I had a few different things going for you last week.
[308:34.22]I had a couple of payments that I was a little late on.
[308:36.72]It's been kind of a difficult time, and I'm wondering, I'm looking for a raise.
[308:40.04]This is the only job I had.
[308:41.20]This is cleaning this house.
[308:42.12]Whose house am I... Did I say it?
[308:44.62]You could fucking speak it?
[308:47.52]Uh...
[308:49.59]Just on my way to work.
[308:50.69]How's it going?
[308:51.43]Hasn't.
[308:51.71]Well.
[308:52.07]Good day.
[308:54.07]Blood Wigger Amelia works generally, but thank you.
[308:56.13]Good day to you, too.
[308:57.64]Time to return to my home.
[309:31.33]To the king, however poorly he treats us.
[310:17.89]I own two houses, it doesn't make a lot of sense to go to work.
[310:21.80]I could just rent out a house.
[310:24.14]Doesn't add a lot of value to society, but it's a good way to accumulate wealth.
[310:32.94]But nothing over 2.6 million.
[310:35.90]That would be too much, frankly.
[310:40.35]Alright, why did I leave it open?
[310:46.11]If you leave both open, it kind of ruins the illusion.
[310:48.59]Never mind, but... Do people just come to my house?
[310:57.66]Let me take off my work uniform.
[311:03.88]Okay, can we do one thing that's good for me?
[311:08.02]Alright?
[311:09.00]Shower, piss, eat, sleep.
[311:11.99]I think all of them would be pretty helpful right now.
[311:18.75]Play outside.
[311:19.73]Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[311:21.45]No, I have to piss.
[311:22.11]Oh, yeah, play outside.
[311:23.21]Yay!
[311:30.83]Whoa!
[311:34.74]Does this get a...
[311:36.40]In trouble?
[311:37.20]Well, that was fun.
[311:41.49]Good performance.
[312:06.41]Can I do something good for me?
[312:07.59]I don't want to be outside.
[312:16.24]I'll just, I'll hover near things that I would like to do.
[312:19.42]And maybe, maybe, you know, it's like a hint.
[312:32.79]Didn't close the legs then.
[312:36.36]Didn't mean to do that.
[312:37.18]It's more eluding.
[312:42.92]Okay, there's already a lot of piss in the bed.
[312:45.13]I feel like having a bedroom through a room with a reciprocating saw and a sledgehammer and a knife that is far too sharp and a bunch of broken drywall isn't the safest way to live life.
[313:10.16]Wow, look at this.
[313:12.60]Maybe still avail- I don't know.
[313:24.49]Alright.
[320:58.99]Hey!
[320:59.29]Hey!
[320:59.79]Ah!
[321:00.17]Ah!
[321:02.75]What?
[321:03.77]What are you doing in my house?
[321:10.62]You're gifting me cookies.
[321:14.52]No, get... Stop gifting me...
[321:31.79]Okay, you didn't trap us in here.
[321:40.49]You sit on the stool.
[321:44.78]What are you doing in my home?
[321:57.27]Oh, of course it's you!
[322:02.05]You couldn't even be a proper man?
[322:04.67]A shadow boxer?
[322:06.97]You know how hard it was to get involved in that group?
[322:10.37]Was it like their auditions?
[322:11.79]What do you mean?
[322:12.61]Just hold on a second.
[322:13.31]Delete the save.
[322:14.77]Delete the save file.
[322:16.06]We're going to start over.
[322:17.32]What?
[322:17.60]Delete the save file.
[322:18.50]We're going to start over from a new house.
[322:20.00]Delete the save if you could.
[322:22.10]Delete the save file.
[322:24.15]Oh, delete the save.
[322:25.99]Delete it right now.
[322:26.87]We're gonna start over.
[322:27.77]I can't do this anymore.
[322:28.47]You can't be in my house.
[322:30.25]Not gonna happen.
[322:32.49]No way.
[322:34.01]Not a chance in hell am I gonna let this happen.
[322:37.01]You don't live here.
[322:37.92]But I earned it.
[322:39.26]You can't just redo it.
[322:40.18]No, I can redo it, because I'm gonna redo the save, and we're gonna start a new game.
[322:46.18]Starting right now.
[322:47.28]Oh, it's a lot of piss.
[322:48.18]Hello, production?
[322:49.66]Production, I'd like to start a new save file, please.
[322:54.66]What?
[322:55.34]No!
[322:56.42]I get to keep it!
[322:57.68]No, you can't keep it.
[322:58.60]What's your big plan now?
[322:59.58]Run the poll again.
[323:00.56]You can't- Run the poll again.
[323:01.74]Run it again.
[323:02.44]Run the poll again.
[323:03.20]This is my house.
[323:04.14]This is my domain.
[323:05.18]This is my house.
[323:05.98]Wait, what are you saying?
[323:06.68]It's rigged, you're just gonna run the poll again?
[323:08.48]Okay, by the way, let me see you do this.
[323:09.96]Let's see how I fuck- Let's see if you deserve this house.
[323:12.90]Beat you to it.
[323:16.74]You did.
[323:17.52]You did beat me to it.
[323:19.08]You did.
[323:19.46]Oh, do it again.
[323:20.32]Ready?
[323:20.66]One, two- Just delete the save.
[323:22.53]No, I'm better than that.
[323:24.51]Just delete the save file, guys.
[323:26.34]I won't call you anymore if you delete the save file.
[323:29.00]You can come in.
[323:29.84]You can come in.
[323:30.56]Come in.
