[15:23.18]Unless there's something weird I can put on the arms.
[15:28.29]No.

[16:51.64]Who cares?
[16:52.28]This is gonna take like two hours.
[16:55.02]Special move.
[16:55.62]That's all we care about.
[16:56.52]That's gonna be the low blow.
[17:08.25]Oh, this is so funny.
[17:10.47]It's just WWE 2K.
[17:11.99]Yeah, like, probably a much better version of it.

[17:17.36]These are fine.
[17:18.66]Let's, like, figure out... Let's get to the game.
[17:20.56]Okay, so Attribute...
[17:27.92]He's gotta be good.
[17:33.06]Charisma, who cares about charisma?
[17:35.92]As long as he's strong and will win, I don't care.
[17:38.28]No charisma.
[17:46.72]Only strength, speed, and endurance.
[17:52.32]He's gotta be really fast.
[17:56.19]Yeah, max out his joke tree.
[18:00.03]Alright, that's good.
[18:01.99]I think I'm ready.
[18:05.05]I'm ready to accept it.
[18:06.27]Is this how I do it?
[18:07.01]Is this it?
[18:09.09]I would love to save this guy.
[18:10.91]Barry.
[18:12.03]There he is.
[18:14.49]Okay, so we're going to do story mode with rude medium with Barry.
[18:27.04]Here we go.
[18:36.11]Historia.
[18:37.41]This is real footage.
[18:38.67]This is live action footage.
[18:41.81]I gotta move this.
[18:55.57]Shit, I don't know.
[19:00.75]I don't speak Spanish.
[19:02.45]What am I talking about?
[19:03.47]I can read the subtitles.
[19:06.32]Oh, shit.
[19:09.30]Okay, how do I... Burying the corpse.
[19:13.16]Wait, what?
[19:17.78]What's going on with that guy's mouth?
[19:19.54]Hold on, wait.
[19:20.78]Where's my wrestler?
[19:24.16]Tired of training?
[19:24.88]The rookie Rudo has joined... Conan's Legion.
[19:28.86]That's... Okay, that guy... That guy's very clearly, like, holding a very large thing in front of his groin area.
[19:37.54]The rookie Rudo has joined Conan's Legion, hoping to finally make his debut in the AAA, but Conan disagrees.
[19:42.45]For now, he should be satisfied with fighting in a garage in front of only a handful of people.
[19:49.95]Who am I playing as?
[19:57.26]I'm just watching this or am I playing this we're gonna fight in a garage this is not a garage who are they waving to that's not what they that's not what like people do
[20:18.58]If those are supposed to be cheerleaders or, quote, ring girls, they don't just sit there and wave like Queen Elizabeth.
[20:24.14]Don't they shake hands and take pictures and stuff?
[20:34.11]Alright, here we go.
[20:38.91]Damn it.
[20:40.03]I'm ready for the AAA.
[20:43.56]I keep telling Conan that I'm ready for the big time.
[20:46.84]John Madden, everybody.
[20:47.74]It keeps making me wait.
[20:49.72]Longer and longer.
[20:53.30]Meaningless training match after meaningless training match.
[20:57.76]Look at the opponents they keep pitting me against.
[21:00.56]I don't know how to play.
[21:03.68]Like this pathetic excuse for a technical wannabe.
[21:08.29]AJ, the receiver.
[21:12.64]We're going to learn baptism by fire.
[21:14.50]We're going to learn to play the game.
[21:15.74]I love this game.
[21:17.52]We're going to turn the game sound off.
[21:33.52]After this big down, no one will be able to deny me my shot at destiny.
[21:38.36]This guy really is like a sex dungeon guy.
[21:40.74]Alright, whatever.
[21:41.96]Let's go.
[21:42.62]Let's kick this guy's ass.
[21:43.52]He's the rising star, and many say he's the future of wrestling.

[22:13.68]Oh, nice.
[22:14.12]Okay, here's the tutorial.
[22:17.56]Alright, that's how you punch.
[22:18.64]Alright, that's how you get out of the ring.
[22:22.59]Nope, this is how... Okay, that's how you get on the turnbuckle.
[22:27.47]His X. Alright, well, I fucked that up.
[22:31.25]R2-D2 with a simple grapple.
[22:36.51]This guy's a voice changer, Ron.
[22:40.25]Oh my god, the commentary is so awful.
[22:47.51]When the icon appears above your head, it's the right one to counter.
[22:50.06]R1 is counter.
[22:50.74]Why would we do that when we could do this?
[23:06.40]strong grapple okay got it give me the chair is guaranteed to become a future superstar oh this is we're gonna play this game for a long time oh look at the chair I bent the chair over this guy's head the chair okay that that person would die

[23:42.92]Break his neck.
[23:43.34]Oh, come on.
[23:44.10]Alright, get back in the ring.
[23:50.54]That's a run again, right?
[23:51.44]Back and... That's not what I wanted.
[23:54.75]God damn it.
[23:55.33]Fuck, now I'm on the ground.
[23:56.41]How do I... Get up.
[24:04.09]Did I do those scratches to that guy?
[24:05.95]I think I scratched the fuck out of that guy.
[24:14.27]God damn it.
[24:15.17]I was kicking this guy's ass.
[24:16.35]Now I'm, like, getting destroyed.
[24:18.33]The game, like, figured out I, like, I didn't want to teach me.
[24:23.25]Oh, my God.
[24:24.93]Here's this in the crowd.
[24:28.25]I have to counter move.
[24:30.27]Jesus Christ, dude.
[24:32.81]I forgot, what was the light grapple?
[24:35.07]I don't remember what light grapple was.
[24:36.85]It gave me every fucking piece of control.
[24:39.47]Okay, L2 is strong grapple.
[24:41.17]Alright, kick his ass.
[24:43.69]Get on the top rope.
[24:55.72]Good.
[24:58.46]That's how you sit on him.
[24:59.36]How do you fucking pin him?
[25:00.24]Ow.
[25:00.76]He's gonna achieve it.
[25:02.32]That's what I thought.
[25:03.42]I thought I won that one.
[25:05.46]Shit.
[25:27.34]Well, I can do a move, what the fuck?
[25:30.89]What the fuck is this game?
[25:32.97]It's Lucha Libre and I'm about to lose.
[25:35.29]I don't know how to pin the fucking character.
[25:37.51]How do I pin?
[25:38.29]Alright.
[25:38.61]Pin.
[25:39.35]What's pin?
[25:40.25]That's not pin.
[25:52.76]R2 is to execute a move set.
[25:54.18]Man, I could win this.
[25:55.14]Nice flip.
[25:56.62]Alright, uh, we're gonna do it again.
[25:58.38]Some grapples will start a submission.
[25:59.58]You should repeatedly press the show button to... I'm gonna catch that every time.
[26:07.85]No, that was too late.
[26:20.95]I'm going to lose a Libra, I am.
[26:22.73]I think I have to, like, break this guy's neck.
[26:26.56]Did I get it?
[26:27.82]Okay.
[26:28.24]Pin character.
[26:29.50]Nope.
[26:30.02]I need one Charisma to pin.
[26:31.08]Is it circled?
[26:31.50]No, it's not.
[26:51.12]Yeah, I'm sure he is.
[26:51.80]I love how they told me that.
[26:53.06]Please.
[26:53.68]Okay, I got it.
[26:54.44]That's it.
[26:54.88]I win.
[26:55.14]Okay, I don't know.
[26:56.48]Okay.
[26:56.80]It's L2.
[27:24.10]Lo importante es que un luchador mantenga su honor en las luchas, que defienda ante toda la legalidad con sus acciones.
[27:42.48]Un buen luchador se permite todo con tal de ganar mal.
[27:48.92]This is my... The guy with the shitty Halloween costume is my guy, right?
[27:52.42]The guy wearing the bag costume from iParty is my guy.
[28:18.84]No one can deny that the kid showed guts, but today this young Rudo will get a taste of what the AAA is really about.
[28:23.76]Conan decides to drop him into the middle of a nest of vipers.
[28:27.28]Just to see if he can survive in a triple threat match against Dark Scorio and El Brazo.
[28:32.86]Disqualification is turned on.
[28:35.44]Dropping me into a pit of snakes.
[28:40.35]Alright, now at least I know how to pin.
[28:41.39]It's gonna take me a little while to figure this out.
[28:45.63]I gotta change the name here.
[28:54.67]It's gonna be a large loading screen.
[29:00.01]We're good, though.
[29:02.77]Hey, well, we got a minute.
[29:04.85]Thank you to... We don't have a minute.
[29:06.85]You guys are gonna be really mad if I ever skip this intro, aren't you?
[29:19.17]I can never skip it.
[29:27.81]I can't wait.
[29:29.10]I have to skip it.
[29:30.06]It sucks.
[29:31.56]I don't want to see this anymore.
[29:34.36]We can see this.
[29:43.27]I'm not gonna lie, I swear to God, I thought this was a girl coming out, and I thought that she was just topless and I was about to be like, well, there it is, guys.
[29:51.14]Whoops.
[29:51.40]Alright, nobody cares about you.
[29:55.20]Alright, this is a triple threat.
[29:56.94]First pin wins, right?
[30:09.18]Well, I fucked that up.
[30:11.24]Wait, am I fighting both people at the same time?
[30:14.82]I'm confused.
[30:15.36]No, no, no.
[30:15.82]It's a triple threat.
[30:17.44]It's a legit triple threat.
[30:19.20]How do I change who I'm targeting?
[30:20.93]Break him off.
[30:22.11]He just got doubled.
[30:35.82]Wait, what is this guy doing?
[30:37.32]Wait, I thought this was disqualification.
[30:40.04]This guy's doing his finishing move to me.
[30:42.68]Get off!
[30:44.86]What the f-
[31:03.56]Oh, my fucking face.
[31:05.70]Oh, my fucking whole body.
[31:07.42]What happened to the disqualifications?
[31:17.19]You understand?
[31:17.93]This is supposed to be a disqualification match.
[31:21.05]You get disqualified, but you can't.
[31:23.77]What a fucking great game.
[31:30.23]I fucking love it.
[31:34.09]They're gonna get him in a combo.
[31:36.74]I was not expecting that.
[31:38.10]Holy shit.
[31:45.65]I don't even care anymore.
[31:46.73]All I care about is beating the shit out of this poor old guy.
[31:53.03]Oh shit, I got warned.
[31:54.53]They just warned both benches.
[31:59.80]That's one more warning.
[32:01.10]Please don't punch the ref in the face anymore.
[32:03.40]Warning number three.
[32:08.02]Right in the eyes.
[32:10.32]And spin and run.
[32:12.64]Ow.
[32:13.62]Hey, that guy has a special.
[32:14.50]Which one's it?
[32:15.42]What the fuck?
[32:16.96]Why would you go outside with that?
[32:23.46]What would you... What are you thinking?
[32:25.88]I can't pick this guy up.
[32:26.89]He's too heavy.
[32:28.15]I'm not gonna do it again.
[32:31.65]No, I'm not gonna do that again.
[32:35.99]If I punch the ref in the face again, I'm gonna lose.
[32:42.76]Oh, did you see that shit?
[32:45.70]No, target the guy over there.
[32:46.92]Target the wrong guy.
[32:47.91]God damn it.
[32:48.89]I think I'm too big.
[32:53.24]How do you even do a special move?
[32:54.96]How do I kick a guy in the nuts?
[32:58.48]God damn it.
[33:01.77]Damn it.
[33:03.39]What's, what's like the, what it has to be like?
[33:07.15]I need more like stats.
[33:08.19]I wasn't, I wasn't even lying inside of that like I could fight.
[33:10.71]Oh, he's doing his finishing move to me.
[33:12.05]Help me.
[33:12.29]Do something.
[33:23.72]That's the guy's finishing move.
[33:27.12]Me and El Brazo are both like all fucked up.
[33:31.74]This guy can't win.
[33:36.12]Just continuously elbow drop.
[33:37.90]Oh, damn it.
[33:39.74]Alright, please tell me, is this guy gonna go get like a knife?
[33:43.28]Alright, I got it.
[33:44.18]I reversed it.
[33:44.78]I can't do any fucking move to this guy.
[33:47.82]Why?
[33:58.84]I can't do any moves.
[34:00.24]Why?
[34:00.60]I don't have any stars to do moves.
[34:03.09]How do I get stars?
[34:06.32]I'm hunched over like an old man with a fucking spine problem.
[34:09.50]You see this shit?
[34:11.58]I don't have any fans.
[34:15.92]No, don't do it.
[34:18.26]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[34:21.57]It must be cold outside.
[34:23.05]My fucking spine hurts.
[34:24.49]It's fucking zero charisma.
[34:28.43]What a fucking funny joke.
[34:31.35]That's good that I can do it.
[34:32.83]I can't do any moves.
[34:35.26]I don't have enough fans to do a move.
[34:37.40]I can't even fucking hurt him.
[34:43.72]No, he's gonna special.
[34:44.38]Get away from me.
[34:46.88]Come on, give me some charisma.
[34:50.14]Oh, god, please.
[34:51.06]If somebody accidentally hit the ref so I can continue...
[35:05.34]I'm so useless.
[35:05.96]I'm just like a meat bag right now.
[35:07.18]That's really all I am.
[35:10.58]You know, I'm gonna try to go for some, like... I'm gonna go for something wacky here.
[35:14.30]Watch this.
[35:15.09]Let's see if the AI is, like, dumb enough.
[35:16.91]Can I, like, bait the AI out here?
[35:18.35]Oh, no.
[35:18.85]No, no, no, no, no.
[35:20.83]Put this down.
[35:21.73]How do I put this down?
[35:24.71]How do I put down the fluorescent light bulb?
[35:27.62]Is that what this is?
[35:29.78]No, put the fluorescent light bulb down.
[35:38.02]He's trying to get away from me.
[35:40.38]If he does it again, that's an instant disqualification.
[35:49.82]I would have just won.
[35:52.05]I would have just won.
[35:54.27]I would have won the match.
[35:58.31]You gotta be kidding me.
[35:59.41]I would have won the fucking match.
[36:09.53]I'm so... No, I'm so fucking sad right now.
[36:12.89]Are you kidding me?
[36:19.31]I would have actually... Oh my god, this game is fucking perfect.
[36:31.47]This is actually fucking hilarious.
[36:34.17]God damn it.
[36:35.25]Do I actually have to make a new character because this guy can't play?
[36:41.61]Ugh.
[36:45.68]I gotta go back.
[36:46.36]I have to give him... Can I edit him?
[36:51.27]I can't do moves.
[36:53.49]I didn't know that moves were tied.
[36:55.17]Edit, right?
[37:02.52]Who cares about speed?
[37:05.14]You have to have charisma.
[37:08.80]At least enough to be able to build one star to do a move.
[37:18.05]Strength will go like... Nobody... I don't need speed or endurance.
[37:22.37]This is good.
[37:25.25]Maybe you should have read the instructions.
[37:26.89]I mean, I... I guess you're right.
[37:29.34]Okay, save that.
[37:31.82]Let's go.
[37:32.24]This should be good.
[37:37.14]4% completed.
[37:37.54]Alright, let's do this again.
[37:39.54]I'm not going to waste any time.
[37:40.82]We already saw this.
[37:41.60]Continue.
[37:42.08]Let's do it.
[37:43.02]Loading.
[37:45.33]Oh, man, that was fucking... That whole match just blew the lid off my brain.
[37:51.84]Anyways.
[37:54.68]Thank you, Radio Vidya, for the $1.
[37:56.40]Molag Nacho Libre.
[37:58.60]Molag Lunch Luchador.
[38:00.40]Also, new TF2.
[38:03.46]Luchador.
[38:05.64]Yeah, there's apparently a huge TF2 update coming out.
[38:08.76]Too bad I'm not going to be around to play it.
[38:12.77]I'm skipping it.
[38:13.77]We can watch it next time.
[38:16.75]Alright, look at those stars.
[38:17.49]I already got them.
[38:19.25]I already got two stars.
[38:23.38]Alright, should I turn the commentary off?
[38:29.08]There he goes.
[38:32.32]He's definitely suffering from internal bleeding.
[38:38.36]Finally, I can actually do moves.
[38:41.21]I don't know who did what to who.
[38:43.79]Nice du- Wow.
[38:44.75]That was a fucking dodge and a half.
[38:47.63]Move behind and move right here.
[38:51.10]Right in the neck.
[38:52.06]Break his neck.
[39:04.42]See, look at, now I'm kicking ass.
[39:06.75]I'm doing reversals and shit.
[39:11.65]I'm doing, like, sloppy shitty punches.
[39:13.97]Oh, come on, I wasn't even paying attention.
[39:19.52]What?
[39:19.76]You weren't even aiming at me.
[39:20.72]That's such horseshit.
[39:21.70]I'm going to go punch the ref.
[39:28.99]Come on.
[39:29.39]Block it.
[39:29.99]No, I don't want to pin him.
[39:32.39]Or do I?
[39:32.57]Block that.
[39:32.93]Light grab.
[39:33.29]Into an eye poke.
[39:33.87]Kick him.
[39:56.22]I'll get... I'm gonna... I have to do my special at least once.
[39:58.76]He's making fun of his opponent and I love it.
[40:03.14]I missed.
[40:08.16]Don't let him hit me.
[40:09.88]And by the way, I'm gonna punch the ref right in the face if, like, somebody is gonna get pinned.
[40:12.76]That's a block.
[40:13.54]No, it's not.
[40:13.92]What?
[40:14.38]Holy shit, that would've been bad.
[40:16.82]He wants to break loose, but his team
[40:34.30]I'm just gonna be like a dick and grab from behind.
[40:39.14]I don't like that.
[40:40.14]That's easy enough.
[40:40.61]What the fuck was that?
[40:42.53]No, you're not.
[40:50.97]It's so hard to do anything with two people fighting you.
[40:55.75]Did he say I'm about to die?
[40:56.83]He's about to... Please.
[41:05.13]What the fuck, man?
[41:06.03]You can't... Will you guys fight each other for a second?
[41:08.89]God damn it.
[41:11.35]Now I'm going to have a special move.
[41:13.73]Here we go.
[41:14.41]Everybody just do moves to me.
[41:15.73]Pick up the guy in the fucking diaper and do moves to him.
[41:18.67]I don't have enough charisma to do that.
[41:27.38]Chokeslam.
[41:27.86]Come on.
[41:28.78]Alright.
[41:29.26]Go, go, go.
[41:30.12]Perfect.
[41:30.52]Perfect.
[41:31.12]I can build it here.
[41:51.01]Reversal.
[41:51.63]Again.
[41:52.21]Reverse it.
[41:57.79]It's all about just fucking reversing.
[42:00.78]I can't when there's this many... I'm gonna get it.
[42:02.92]I'm getting this guy in the nuts.
[42:04.16]Good.
[42:04.36]Thank you.
[42:04.86]Thanks for the help.
[42:17.21]Haunting gives you stars?
[42:18.15]How do I taunt?
[42:18.71]Like that.
[42:26.40]I can do it.
[42:27.98]Get it!
[42:34.30]I was just fucking freaked out.
[42:35.50]How do I do a special move?
[42:36.56]I have like lucha stars.
[42:42.78]Come on.
[42:43.28]I got him.
[42:43.60]I got him.
[42:45.76]Alright, how do I do it?
[42:47.10]What do I do?
[42:51.30]What button do I have to press?
[42:52.58]Oh, goddammit.
[42:53.68]Oh, just taunt.
[42:56.52]Now, hold on.
[42:58.04]I need game controls.
[42:59.28]To execute combo?
[42:59.96]Execute combo.
[43:15.94]Weak grapple.
[43:16.94]Yeah, strong grapple.
[43:19.62]Run, running attack.
[43:20.98]Jump off the ring.
[43:23.54]Grapple while running.
[43:24.95]Get off the ring.
[43:26.37]Attack from the turnbuckle.
[43:29.13]Feint.
[43:30.71]Pin.
[43:35.71]What the fuck?
[43:44.95]I don't think it is a... My fucking stomach hurts.
[43:51.41]Maybe it's one of these?
[43:52.45]I don't know.
[43:59.09]He can't even pick me up.
[44:00.03]That's bullshit.
[44:00.39]I don't know who's... He did it to me, I guess.
[44:13.99]R1 and L1, is it?
[44:15.47]I'm just going to do this until I get my... Oh, give it to me.
[44:26.37]Just throw my hands in the air a little bit.
[44:28.51]No, it's not... Alright, there it is!
[44:29.95]How do I do it?
[44:30.55]Okay.
[44:30.67]Okay.
[44:46.70]No, I can't... Alright, go!
[44:49.93]I don't even know how to... You gotta throw somebody over the ropes to even make this possible.
[45:00.33]Somebody has to go.
[45:04.34]We have to make... Okay, we got like a ref knockout situation here.
[45:12.46]It's not gonna be it.
[45:15.02]I need to throw you out.
[45:16.50]This is it.
[45:20.54]Here it comes, and again.
[45:24.54]Get down!
[45:25.02]Hit him!
[45:25.40]Yes!
[45:25.68]I've unlocked the map Caravan.
[45:26.91]I unlocked a video.
[45:41.27]Alright.
[45:42.35]Let's go.
[45:43.13]I don't want to hear it.
[45:45.66]I don't want to hear the music right now.
[45:49.68]That took way longer than it should have.
[45:54.10]Training the rookie.
[45:54.72]We're going up against Sting.
[45:55.78]Let's watch the cutscene.
[46:04.79]He's way too close to the mic.
[46:12.92]And he's holding his hands like this.
[46:17.15]He's going like this.
[46:17.79]This is what this guy's doing.
[46:20.41]He's going like this.
[46:23.93]Hey, he's cupping his hands in front of his face.
[46:28.01]That was dubbed afterwards.
[46:29.06]That was not actually recorded.
[46:30.26]He was not being recorded there.
[46:33.66]fatal facing of four match 10 second count out no disqualification oh god please at least I can just go get like a knife I can go get like a chair or something to smash people in the face maybe we can just beat the ref up because I don't think there's gonna be a ref
[47:05.32]I missed, like, a bunch of bits.
[47:09.28]Uh... After this backdrop catch-up.
[47:13.03]Throw the wrestlers into the audience.
[47:22.93]We still have a couple of games to... We have at least, like, three or four more games to try tonight, but... I'm kind of stuck on this one.
[47:29.16]I'm having fun in this game.
[47:33.58]I hate this music so much.
[47:34.86]I know.
[47:35.24]It's awful.
[47:37.40]We can't skip new instruments.
[47:40.32]That should be a rule.
[47:42.76]Lights are going to turn on.
[47:49.35]He's going to be there with fireworks.
[47:52.01]Just Kane.
[47:54.19]This wrestler just copied Sting and Kane.
[47:58.47]Is this supposed to be Sting?
[48:01.85]Did he move into like a luchadori league?
[48:03.87]Same thing.
[48:04.37]Here comes more fireworks.
[48:06.23]Gonna spray them.
[48:07.47]There they are.
[48:08.17]Got a nice Faldrogo beard.
[48:21.67]Oh, your intro is terrible.
[48:22.89]Oh, god damn it.
[48:24.13]No, it's fine.
[48:24.70]Who cares about that?
[48:26.64]I had to skip that.
[48:28.14]Alright, let's do it.
[48:30.64]Fatal pull away.
[48:33.38]Stop.
[48:33.88]Come on, man.
[48:35.44]Holy shit, that guy just did like a dragon splash.
[48:40.62]Don't get off.
[48:41.36]Oh my god, you're so dumb.
[48:42.50]Don't get something.
[48:43.07]Can I pull the light switch?
[48:47.09]No disqualifications.
[48:48.13]Just get in there.
[48:55.48]The chair over his back.
[48:56.82]Is that it?
[48:57.64]That's gonna be it, right?
[48:59.38]That guy's moving around so strangely off the top ropes.
[49:05.34]I feel like he's glitching.
[49:09.32]What else we got?
[49:11.77]Can I throw this?
[49:18.71]Oh, come on.
[49:21.49]What a fucking anticlimactic bunch of bullshit.
[49:26.92]Poor Sting.
[49:27.62]I just did it again to Sting.
[49:29.92]Well, he's gonna lose.
[49:31.32]Ow.
[49:31.62]All I've been doing is getting weapons.
[49:36.50]I haven't even been playing the game.
[49:39.24]Oh, look.
[49:39.50]I found a chair out here.
[49:40.55]I wonder if I should bring it in.
[49:42.79]Okay.
[49:43.49]Come here, you!
[49:53.74]Alright, talk, talk.
[49:54.54]This is where you talk.
[49:56.10]What the hell was that?
[49:57.02]Get out of here.
[49:57.64]Pin the ref.
[49:58.42]That's hard to time.
[49:59.18]Any other weapons?
[49:59.98]Can I grab somebody?
[50:01.32]I can grab somebody through these ropes here.
[50:23.89]He's gonna be like the trapdoor spider trying to grab someone.
[50:30.12]Oh, wait a minute, there's a count-out.
[50:31.34]Okay.
[50:32.32]Yeah, he's about to die.
[50:36.16]He does say it.
[50:36.74]He's about to die.
[50:37.62]Yep, he's about to die.
[50:40.79]This ain't like WWE, guys.
[50:43.53]You die in this league.
[50:45.51]There's no other weapons?
[50:48.61]What kind of fucking hardcore match is this?
[50:51.15]Whatever.
[50:51.45]Oh, god.
[50:52.19]Really?
[50:52.37]Both of you?
[50:52.81]That was so close.
[51:19.69]I love it.
[51:23.17]Focus on the guy.
[51:24.21]You idiot.
[51:24.65]Don't let him hit him.
[51:25.33]Spook slam.
[51:26.27]I win.
[51:26.55]Who's doing what move?
[51:47.73]Everyone's doing the taunt technique.
[51:49.29]I didn't block that?
[51:49.99]Getting like the stars is actually more difficult when you have somebody that's good.
[52:17.80]That guy's holding his head.
[52:18.60]Can't do any moves?
[52:23.46]God damn it.
[52:24.16]Come on, man.
[52:25.14]I didn't block it.
[52:28.44]Fuck.
[52:31.12]Whoa!
[52:31.74]I want to get on the top rope.
[52:36.81]This is like Lucha Libre.
[52:38.09]Like, why can I not climb the rope?
[52:45.37]I just wanna get on the fucking top rope, dude.
[52:48.41]Holy shit!
[52:49.55]Pin him!
[52:50.11]PIN HIM!
[52:51.03]Break his arms!
[52:52.13]It's hard to even talk with this game.
[53:08.94]Who's gonna pin who first?
[53:10.32]This could be the end.
[53:11.98]This is a compromising position.
[53:15.86]You know, I'm gonna go for a really, really interesting move here.
[53:19.39]I'm gonna try to kick everybody over the top rope.
[53:22.49]Yes, it is.
[53:25.19]I'm gonna do the same thing.
[53:26.15]Come on.
[53:28.15]He did it for me.
[53:29.35]Don't even fucking tell me.
[53:30.64]Listen to the fact the other day.
[53:34.40]I kept burning you, you Carlos.
[53:37.87]Alright, let's get into the distance and build some stars.
[53:45.93]If you taunt in this game, they automatically try to come for you.
[53:50.69]It's fine.
[53:51.67]Just keep taunting.
[53:53.11]Build up the stars.
[53:54.03]That's all you gotta do.
[53:55.07]This is just like Revenge.
[53:56.60]Remember WCW Revenge?
[53:57.92]All I gotta do is just hang out over here.
[54:01.66]Just let the crowd know I'm cool.
[54:04.88]Let them waste their time.
[54:05.98]If somebody gets pinned, I'm gonna run over there.
[54:11.86]And whoever's left standing, I'm gonna go kick them in the nuts and win the game.
[54:18.45]Okay, here we go.
[54:22.91]Almost there.
[54:23.35]Remember, whoever's on the ground.
[54:25.33]Okay, here we go.
[54:32.26]Who do I do?
[54:32.78]How do I do it?
[54:35.51]Stop that, please.
[54:36.29]What was the button?
[54:39.01]It was... How the fuck did I do that?
[54:40.81]I forget.
[54:41.23]I already forget.
[54:41.91]There it is.
[54:47.70]No, get off me.
[54:49.26]Oh, come on.
[54:50.10]Don't do this stupid UFC bear hug move.
[54:54.02]Just do it.
[54:57.48]Okay, no doubt.
[54:58.36]Just grab this guy.
[55:02.29]He's gonna get pinned and we're gonna lose now.
[55:04.67]Don't let him do that shit.
[55:05.83]I gotta end this shit now.
[55:12.36]All these orcs in the ring.
[55:13.40]How do I do the Irish whip?
[55:17.26]Idiot.
[55:17.64]I'm trying to grab that guy and not do that.
[55:36.66]No!
[55:37.92]Don't let him do it!
[55:39.24]I'm currently in trouble!
[55:41.04]Okay, good.
[55:44.42]This is my opportunity!
[55:46.16]Opportunity!
[55:46.68]God.
[55:46.91]Everybody just gets in the fucking way.
[55:48.33]And now it's over!
[55:49.25]Stop!
[55:49.39]No!
[55:49.61]You stupid idiot!
[55:59.14]Wait, it's just me!
[56:00.90]Huh?
[56:01.22]What happened?
[56:01.76]Oh, you eliminate people.
[56:03.24]Why have we been stopping it?
[56:04.43]He's getting up very slowly from this.
[56:07.73]Oh my god, I'm so stupid.
[56:09.09]I... I've broken up like four pins.
[56:15.61]And that is exactly the counter hold for that hold.
[56:19.08]I have never seen that before.
[56:22.38]That's fine.
[56:22.80]Hurt him.
[56:23.78]Go for it.
[56:24.44]Break his legs.
[56:25.08]The referee is asking if he submits or not.
[56:27.56]You two just fucking... Get up.
[56:37.06]Get the fuck up.
[56:38.16]Get away from me.
[56:39.90]I'm gonna get cut out.
[56:54.15]It's so long.
[56:57.27]Trapped to a spider.
[57:01.65]God damn it.
[57:07.88]Play a different game?
[57:08.62]I can't.
[57:10.26]I have to stay on this for another few minutes.
[57:13.78]This is like the game of the night.
[57:18.78]Not yet.
[57:19.18]I'm going to try this.
[57:20.28]I want to do like a match.
[57:21.28]We're going to do like a hardcore match with like 20 people.
[57:31.26]We have to at least try to do our own rules and try to get like 30 people in one room.
[57:37.59]You know, we'll just do that now.
[57:39.75]That's what we're going to do.
[57:42.91]Let's go take a look at the actual settings of the game.
[57:51.74]So see, like, pride battle.
[57:52.98]Choose match rules and play against other players.
[57:54.66]Okay, here we go.
[57:57.16]So this is fatal.

[58:37.87]Yeah.
[58:39.09]Alright, so let's go to Pride Battle.
[58:40.75]Let's do Fatal Facing of Thor.
[58:43.83]Win option.
[58:45.95]Inner submission and only combat type by threat.
[58:51.46]CPU, easy, referee, I don't think... Yeah.
[58:58.08]Oh well.
[59:01.22]I guess there's no Royal Rumble.
[59:04.22]Alright, let's move on.
[59:06.69]Fatal Four Ways trademark.
[59:10.42]Well, that was fun.
