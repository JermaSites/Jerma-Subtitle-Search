[02:27.26]Yep.
[02:29.01]What's happening?
[02:39.74]We're starting early today.
[02:43.13]because I'm trying to dodge the nightly internet problems I've been having.
[02:47.50]Who knows if it's going to work?
[02:49.28]I'm buying new internet.
[02:51.96]A new service is coming into this house in a couple days.
[02:56.40]It's getting installed.
[02:58.08]But for the meantime, we have to deal with the current situation, which is... I don't know.
[03:06.13]The hypothesis is that around 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock,
[03:10.37]upload tanks and we're going to try to dodge that by going live at five and trying to get around the fact that the stream goes down at like 9pm so for the purposes of business class yes I'm going to business class and to get business class they have to run a new line to the house so
[03:40.83]It's like a brand new service.
[03:44.92]And it's apparently going to be much more reliable.
[03:51.00]And I don't know.
[03:51.78]If it's not, if it's all screwed up still, then I don't know what to do.
[03:56.80]They're going to have to fix the node on my street if that's the problem.
[04:02.32]It might be going live for a while, but months ago when I was streaming a couple days, like two or three days a week,
[04:09.96]It didn't do this shit.
[04:13.86]I streamed Dark Souls 3 for like eight hours in a row at one point, and it was perfectly fine.
[04:20.02]So I don't know.
[04:20.70]This is a new problem.
[04:23.14]You have business class, Verilich?
[04:25.38]And it's very good.
[04:25.96]Well, that's good to hear.
[04:28.42]Oh, it's the squeaky squawk from Battle.net.
[04:32.48]It is.
[04:35.48]But give me one second here while I set this up.
[04:45.95]Move in with me until it gets fixed.
[04:52.42]You really enjoy the clothes I'm wearing today?
[04:54.60]You can't even see me, man.
[05:00.66]It's definitely a Comcast thing.
[05:02.14]Let's move this over to here.
[05:13.47]So this is where we were last night.
[05:19.74]There's the beautiful art style.
[05:20.74]I need to get a new starting square.
[05:22.04]That's too cinematic looking.
[05:25.98]Okay, let me make sure I can move around.
[05:27.95]This is where we were.
[05:35.31]Nice beard stubble.
[05:38.07]Did I shave recently?
[05:39.09]I don't think so.
[05:43.31]Do I listen to any rap?
[05:45.91]Not particularly.
[05:48.21]I mean, if you talk about like years ago, I like De La Soul.
[05:57.85]But I mean, that's because they work a lot with the Gorillaz.
[06:02.72]Because the Gorillaz are like one of my favorite bands.
[06:07.54]Alright.
[06:09.20]Again, I need to make this pretty clear.
[06:11.36]Let's talk about it again.
[06:12.39]This has been Broken Record, Jerma985.
[06:16.75]Broken record.
[06:17.43]Here we go, guys.
[06:18.07]Ready to hear it?
[06:18.53]Yeah.
[06:24.68]This stream's probably going to turn off.
[06:27.38]You know, like... This stream's going to turn off in like probably two or three hours.
[06:32.89]Or it might just fucking turn off in like an hour, like it did last night.
[06:36.03]Sorry.
[06:38.05]Sorry.
[06:39.70]There's nothing I can, it's completely out of my control at this point.
[06:43.00]It's getting to a position where it's, it's excruciating.
[06:48.91]Alright.
[06:50.29]Very cool.
[06:51.27]Nice.
[06:52.43]So we can, we can move on from that.
[06:57.18]Jeremy likes the gorillas.
[06:58.06]Oh man, they're fucking unbelievable.
[06:59.60]I love the gorillas.
[07:05.15]Damn and right off the bat sab 3600 sab 3600 two times in a row dude Sab with the fucking double Damn man, that is 200.

[08:05.31]I can afford the business class internet now, apparently.
[08:08.61]Wow.
[08:10.91]That's right off the bat, man.
[08:13.17]I hope I can stream for more than, like, a fucking hour.
[08:16.77]God.
[08:21.66]And, by the way, thank you, Snapfreeze and Dar6.
[08:26.35]That's just like... Okay.
[08:30.11]Very much appreciate it, man.
[08:32.73]Glad you enjoy the stream.
[08:38.64]So we have a shorter sub sound now.
[08:42.38]Actually, that caught me off guard.
[08:44.56]Wait, what?
[08:46.18]It's not $500 dues, but thank you for seven months anyways, man.
[08:49.87]Appreciate it.
[08:54.23]Yeah.
[09:04.15]Where are we going?
[09:07.07]Thank you, Salamander64.
[09:08.23]Hi, Mr. Pinky.
[09:10.49]Narf walk for eight months.
[09:13.31]Shower me with Benjamins.
[09:18.48]Thanks, Redheadorama.
[09:21.12]Gooseman, Goosemar, Squirds, Stig Halverson, and Polo Juice.
[09:26.16]Thanks all you guys very much.
[09:28.70]This is even more distracting.
[09:31.24]At least it's shorter.
[09:32.14]At least it's shorter.
[09:34.80]That's one thing.
[09:36.26]Alright, so we were going south.
[09:41.55]Actually, what the fuck?
[09:42.51]I just did the guy's head.
[09:44.37]I just stomped on his head.
[09:45.63]Or I didn't stomp on his head.
[09:48.83]Something like that.
[09:52.55]He tripped over somebody's head running this way.
[09:54.51]I still have Lorag.
[09:55.31]8, 20, 10 gold, 0 rations.
[10:05.00]He's agreeing.
[10:06.98]He's agreeing with me.
[10:11.18]Thank you guys for these subscriptions.
[10:15.59]I dug his head out.
[10:16.39]Let's just go west.
[10:19.15]No, no, no.
[10:19.95]We're going up this way.
[10:23.39]We're going to go north.
[10:26.53]We've left the time constraints.
[10:30.13]And we move on.
[10:33.07]Thank you, DomitronAlphaMan147.
[10:36.55]Chick, where's Chick taken?
[10:40.61]Polo juice for seven months.
[10:42.57]And then Mr. Watt sits as well.
[10:46.83]Listen to me, son.
[10:47.84]I'm your beer.
[10:50.31]Alright.
[10:51.01]So you continue across the plain and the land seems to die with every step.
[10:54.65]Night falls.
[10:55.25]You need to rest, especially after so much walking on an empty stomach.
[10:58.15]There's no place to rest.
[10:59.15]It is open and frighteningly cold.
[11:00.71]There may be more shelter closer to the mountain slopes.
[11:04.45]Okay.
[11:05.73]You continue to walk through the dark.
[11:09.12]Yeah.
[11:15.34]Uh, well, it said that there's probably better shelter over here, so I'll listen to my instincts.
[11:24.68]You walk for half an hour across the endless wastes, falling into an easy stride.
[11:29.61]The moon rises, filling the world with thin silver light.
[11:33.45]The face of the cliff is somewhat unnatural with odd shapes, protrusions, and curves.
[11:38.71]Thank you, Antwine and Cackington.
[11:42.33]Make the cliff dance.
[11:45.87]How do you like hearing yourself burp every five minutes?
[11:52.23]Tell your drunk uncle to leave the room.
[12:01.32]Let's look at the clip.
[12:06.48]Thanks a lot, Noah.
[12:07.40]Thanks a lot, the man of straw.
[12:10.70]You examine the cliff face, feeling over its strangely undulating surface.
[12:14.46]It is as though something had once been carved here.
[12:17.26]Perhaps a head on this side and feet over there.
[12:20.09]Strangely though, it is as though the figure was lying down.
[12:22.43]So I'm going to emulate him.
[12:26.23]I'm going to lie down.
[12:27.37]I'm going to emulate the mountain.
[12:30.15]You settle with your back to the cliff and try to get comfortable.
[12:32.97]There is something unnatural about this place and that makes sleeping here alarming.
[12:36.75]You try to ignore the sensation.
[12:38.56]You've not yet eaten today, but you have two provisions.
[12:40.50]You have no provisions and only a single vial of healing limberry juice.
[12:45.94]I drank it.
[12:48.08]Why not?
[12:51.26]You unstopper your vial of blimberry potion, and knock it quickly back.
[12:56.07]You feel a little better, and all traces of hunger are soon gone.
[12:58.85]Then you lie back and try to forget your troubles.
[13:01.87]You sleep for perhaps an hour, then toss and turn.
[13:04.56]Your face feels hot and you are sweating, and from nearby you can hear a steady hissing sound.
[13:10.28]That's another...
[13:19.55]Thank you, Sizzlebread.
[13:20.74]Thank you, NeverTrustedPurple.
[13:22.22]Thank you, Lazy Luke.
[13:23.48]Thank you, Lazy Luke, for subscribing.
[13:24.62]Thank you, NeverTrustedPurple, for the 100 bits.
[13:26.14]Thank you, Sizzlebread, for your $100.
[13:27.30]He did it again.
[13:33.78]This is... I cannot fucking believe this.
[13:40.32]You guys are, like, gonna make me fucking cry.
[13:44.08]Why are you giving me this much money?
[13:47.81]Do I deserve this much money?
[13:49.59]I'm not sure.
[13:55.40]Thank you nonetheless, though, Sizzlebread.
[13:58.16]That's... Like, I just... How much money did I make in, like, 20 minutes before the stream dies in, like, another 20 minutes?
[14:09.45]Jesus.
[14:11.83]Yeah.
[14:13.37]Thank you so much, man.
[14:16.20]Yeah, and thank you, DK.
[14:19.80]Never trust purple 100 bits.
[14:20.94]We're gonna make him cry, boys!
[14:23.20]No, I just, I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[14:25.41]You guys know how I feel about stuff like this.
[14:27.93]I want to make it, I want you guys to think, if you're gonna pay that much money, I want you to think it was worth doing.
[14:35.97]And I hope, I hope I can somehow at least seem like it's worth it.
[14:42.74]And that's why I get so upset when the stream turns off after a fucking hour.
[14:47.13]But thank you nonetheless, man.
[14:49.95]And thank you, Minister Moo, for your subscription and DK70723.
[14:52.49]So here we go.
[14:57.03]Somebody was hissing.
[14:57.65]There was like a snake.
[15:02.02]Should I just like draw?
[15:03.24]I'm going to draw my sword.
[15:05.31]Moving stealthily, you slide your broadsword from its scabbard before looking up to see your assailant.
[15:09.75]But what meets your eye is most strange.
[15:12.15]A coil of fire seems to be hovering above you.
[15:14.75]As you watch, two sharp talons descend, making a grab for your backpack.
[15:21.57]So it's trying to rob me?
[15:30.30]Let's see what I can do.
[15:37.79]Sub badges, yeah.
[15:38.65]I'm gonna work on all that stuff.
[15:41.29]It's all gonna come through soon.
[15:44.29]Welcome, Patari.
[15:45.05]Thanks a lot, man.
[15:47.83]No zap?
[15:48.39]I can do zob.
[15:49.82]Unknown.
[15:50.60]Zap or zob?
[15:52.84]What is zob?
[15:53.68]Oh, you can do zob.
[15:57.92]Zap.
[15:58.66]There is no zap.
[16:00.60]There is no zap.
[16:01.36]Only hot.
[16:05.36]Zap, zap, zap.
[16:08.90]Let's see what else we got.
[16:10.28]N. Nap.
[16:11.90]Cause sleepiness.
[16:12.54]I don't have a brass pendulum.
[16:17.81]Duff.
[16:19.09]Illusion of treasure.
[16:19.99]Oh, wait.
[16:21.09]If it's going for my backpack, what if I say, oh, yeah, well, like, look at that, like, treasure chest over there, and he'll probably freak out and go get it, right?
[16:28.43]My backpack's full of stuff.
[16:31.07]I'm gonna make, like, a pile of fake gold next to my body, and he'll freak out, and then I can stick the saber right in the back of his head.
[16:39.84]Doc counters fire.
[16:41.29]Hot.
[16:44.11]Dud.
[16:46.61]Zob it right in the butthole.
[16:51.73]What does Zob do?
[16:53.86]We're gonna go dud.
[16:54.98]We're gonna go dud.
[16:55.68]Dud.
[16:57.68]You turn the starlight into alignment around you, and after a moment, gold and jewels begin to spew forth from under your sleeves and from the neck of your boots, rolling away across the ground.
[17:07.52]But the creature seems oblivious to your illusion.
[17:09.80]The talons have closed around the top of your pack.
[17:13.14]Fucking... Alright, he's burning.
[17:18.33]This dude is fucking burning.
[17:22.03]Get fireballed.
[17:24.89]I'm going to torch this guy.
[17:29.18]You weave the spell, creating a ball of flame between your hands.
[17:34.71]But the creature only laughs and flies lower to absorb the fireball into its body.
[17:38.97]The creature is lifting up into the air.
[17:43.29]Grab the pack!
[17:44.31]Grab the pack!
[17:47.51]Should have sobbed.
[17:50.09]You grab onto your pack as the creature rises up into the air, taking you with it.
[17:53.25]It curves down to snarl and snap at you.
[17:55.41]Two reptilian eyes burning with fire.
[17:57.29]Hot calls.
[17:59.50]I am the fire serpent, it declares, and you will die tonight, Anor Lander.
[18:05.69]Give me my backpack back!
[18:07.99]You turk and tug at the strap of the pack, hoping to dislodge it from the creature's grasp.
[18:11.63]The winged creature twists in midair, trying to shake you loose.
[18:14.39]The stitching on the pack's strap begins to fray.
[18:18.86]Give me my fucking backpack, he's like bullying me.
[18:21.84]Give me the backpack!
[18:23.96]You tug the pack once more, sharply, and the strap gives out.
[18:27.32]The pack falls lower with your hanging from it, with you hanging from it.
[18:32.08]The strap held between the clumsy talons of the serpent begins to slip, then all in a rush it runs through and you fall to the ground.
[18:38.51]At least you have your possessions, but where is the serpent?
[18:43.91]Hotshot magic.
[18:46.21]Thanks a lot, FakieSnakey for the sub, and Never Trust Burp for the bits.
[18:49.27]Uh, I'm dead now, I'm gonna pretend to be dead.
[18:52.61]This is the fire serpent, then.
[18:54.11]Alright.
[18:54.59]I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna have to, uh... What is this gonna do to me?
[19:02.40]Alright, get up.
[19:03.92]You get up awkwardly, ankles somewhat twisted.
[19:07.30]The serpent is not finished with you, however.
[19:08.78]It circles you.
[19:09.60]You will burn, it cries.
[19:12.28]Suddenly, the serpent is swooping.
[19:13.29]You are not chasing it.
[19:14.23]It is chasing you.
[19:19.49]Stand and meet it with my sword.
[19:20.59]Wait, what?
[19:22.44]Oh, boy.
[19:29.25]Thanks, guys.
[19:31.29]Look at how much stamina he has.
[19:34.57]I'm fucking dead.
[19:36.85]I'm dead.
[19:37.39]I'm dead.
[19:38.63]He has so much more stamina than me.
[19:43.06]I have to go full fucking blast.
[19:45.42]And I just barely hit him.
[19:49.00]I have to be perfect about this.
[19:52.31]If only you still had that water.
[19:55.11]The flames around the serpent seem to dull for a moment.
[19:57.09]You spin about, blade high above your head.
[19:58.82]The serpent is rearing for you.
[19:59.96]You drive your blade into its open jaw.
[20:02.28]The creature coils its scaly body.
[20:06.60]I'm dead.
[20:12.48]I have to defend here.
[20:15.78]I thought he was gonna fucking... I have to defend again.
[20:19.32]Oh my god!
[20:28.04]He's coming in hard.
[20:29.04]Yeah, I'm fucking dead.
[20:33.10]He's flashing with heat again.
[20:35.94]Lorag.
[20:38.00]Lorag.
[20:40.42]Pray for healing.
[20:48.91]He didn't help me.
[20:50.07]Lorag didn't help me.
[20:51.37]He's laughing at me.
[20:53.81]Okay, well, thanks Lorag.
[20:55.67]Thanks for fucking nothing.
[21:02.20]I got him.
[21:05.31]Can I do it again?
[21:06.31]The serpent's fire grows dull.
[21:07.55]Do it again.
[21:11.75]Snake eyes narrow and watch you.
[21:13.19]It's over.
[21:17.46]I have to go full blast.
[21:19.30]And a 2.4 beats me.
[21:20.00]Beer.
[21:26.92]Son of a gun.
[21:28.14]Oh, son of a gun.
[21:30.88]This is going to... No fucking rewinds, by the way.
[21:33.16]There's no way I'm going to beat this unless I'm perfect.
[21:38.13]Thanks for the EU-friendly stream.
[21:39.29]Well, thanks for the 200-bit squid word.
[21:41.81]Squirds.
[21:44.85]Okay, the blade flashes in the light of the... He's going to come in hard right now.
[21:49.12]Okay.
[21:52.48]Let's pray to Lorag.
[21:58.50]No.
[21:58.60]Of course not.
[22:00.14]Of course not.
[22:05.87]Fire licks the edge of the serpent's mouth.
[22:07.47]You close your eyes and raise a prayer to Lorag.
[22:09.49]I feel like I can come in with like a four.
[22:19.20]Let's go four and a half.
[22:21.42]Oh!
[22:27.70]That was the ticket.
[22:28.48]Yeah, beer.
[22:31.54]The flames around the serpent seem to dull for a moment.
[22:33.46]A quick stab cuts through the serpent's scales.
[22:35.00]The serpent is rearing for you.
[22:36.53]You drive the blade into its open jaw.
[22:37.79]The creature coils its scaly body.
[22:39.39]Do it again.
[22:40.83]Let's do five.
[22:43.51]Ah, there it is.
[22:44.23]Come on.
[22:45.37]Steady.
[22:46.07]Steady.
[22:48.64]The creature's claws draw inwards.
[22:50.10]Do it again.
[22:51.34]Do it again.
[22:52.16]I gotta go full blast here.
[22:55.22]Okay.
[22:55.74]Play smart.
[22:56.46]Play smart.
[22:57.72]Shop smart.
[22:58.38]Shop S-smart.
[23:02.57]Okay.
[23:05.03]He's gonna come in hot.
[23:08.49]A line of fire streaks along the length of the serpent.
[23:10.55]That means he's going like... He's like falling back and he's got his head... He's got like a fucking cobra face.
[23:15.89]You know?
[23:16.23]He's doing the cobra.
[23:18.49]Defend.
[23:20.63]I can only do, I can only take like two fucking more of those, so I have to kill him.
[23:24.37]He's flashing with heat, he's gonna come in again.
[23:28.62]Okay.
[23:32.46]I gotta be smart about this.
[23:33.78]Let's go four.
[23:34.98]No, 4.5.
[23:35.48]Nice.
[23:38.30]Come on, it's gonna be close!
[23:41.14]He flies up into the air.
[23:42.30]I don't know what that means.
[23:45.05]This flying in the air means he's trying to get away from me?
[23:50.47]Wait a second.
[23:50.83]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23:56.48]Fuck.
[24:00.56]Empty water gourd.
[24:03.54]I can't eat some like... Can't I just like stuff my face with raw meat?
[24:09.90]God, I have to beat him.
[24:14.82]I don't know if flying is a defensive move or if that's an offensive move from him.
[24:20.29]I don't know.
[24:22.57]Fall blast.
[24:23.10]7.3.
[24:24.42]Yes!
[24:24.64]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[24:30.66]Heat rises from his scales.
[24:31.96]He's coming in again, but I'm gonna die.
[24:35.58]I'm not gonna be able to do it.
[24:36.34]I don't think it's possible.
[24:38.68]I don't think I can do it.
[24:43.89]I have to go fall blast.
[24:47.11]Oh god!
[24:49.45]I have to do it again!
[24:50.32]I'd lose!
[24:57.98]Defending, you take one stamina.
[24:59.62]I don't think it's physically possible for me to beat this guy.
[25:06.81]Because he has like five more stamina than me.
[25:11.81]Come on, Lorag.
[25:12.91]One of these times you're gonna give me healing.
[25:15.03]You fucking piece of shit.
[25:22.85]He dives in with 14.
[25:25.69]There's no way I can beat that.
[25:29.68]Let's go like... He's gonna do like four and a half again.
[25:32.46]4.6.
[25:32.48]Oh, for the love of fucking God.
[25:41.13]Use the beeswax.
[25:42.07]I can't cast the beeswax spell.
[25:46.24]He licks the edge, he's coming in hard again.
[25:49.00]I could have beat it too.
[25:50.88]I would... fucking no rewinds.
[25:52.64]God damn it!
[25:54.64]Holy shit, I just sizzle bread with 50 bucks.
[25:58.27]Full power!
[26:02.51]Thanks a lot, sizzle bread man, that's... you're too kind, dude.
[26:07.83]Do it again.
[26:10.11]Actually, I kind of got him on the run here.
[26:12.41]The serpent spits and hisses, you've injured it.
[26:13.99]Again, two.
[26:18.88]Oh, look, I'm just dead again!
[26:20.18]Pull up a rewind?
[26:30.24]I can't rewind.
[26:31.78]I said no rewinds.
[26:32.76]I'm gonna beat this guy with skill and finesse.
[26:40.75]I have to take the first hit every time.
[26:43.59]Have to.
[26:45.65]So he just drained his whole bar.
[26:47.33]Let's go with 2.6.
[26:49.49]Perfect.
[26:50.21]Got him.
[26:50.89]Okay, and I didn't use much stamina.
[26:53.07]Fire licks his mouth.
[26:54.09]That means he's coming in hard.
[26:55.45]He's gonna come in... I can't go over... He's gonna do more than... It's like 7.
[27:00.19]Should I do full blast?
[27:03.27]Full blast.
[27:05.75]That was risky, but it was worth it.
[27:06.99]Okay, good.
[27:08.87]Creature... Claws are going in.
[27:10.54]That means he's... Claws inwards means he's defensive.
[27:12.72]Let's go 4.1.
[27:14.64]Hit him again.
[27:15.28]Got him.
[27:15.64]Okay.
[27:15.96]We're fine.
[27:16.46]We're doing good.
[27:17.62]Snake eyes narrow and watch you.
[27:19.08]I don't know.
[27:25.61]I don't think 2 is enough to cut it.
[27:26.99]I think I have to defend here.
[27:29.49]2 was enough to cut it.
[27:30.37]Fuck.
[27:36.19]That just screwed me so bad.
[27:40.45]Was flying in the air a defensive move on his part?
[27:47.31]I don't remember from last time.
[27:52.41]What a talented swordsman.
[27:58.15]It will 5-beat this.
[27:59.05]This is a small one.
[27:59.89]Well, it's the 4.1.
[28:00.57]Okay, good.
[28:01.09]2.
[28:03.11]I'm going to do that a couple more times.
[28:07.92]Okay, he's baring his teeth.
[28:09.24]Bang.
[28:10.82]Defended that one.
[28:11.56]He drained his whole bar.
[28:13.54]He shifts back a little bit.
[28:14.88]Let's go with like five.
[28:15.76]Let's be safe.
[28:17.83]Alright, I gotta do that two more times.
[28:20.29]Turns its body.
[28:22.39]Got him.
[28:23.65]One more time.
[28:26.05]He's coming in hot.
[28:27.53]Coming in hot.
[28:29.21]7.1.
[28:29.27]I got him right here.
[28:30.31]Full blast.
[28:32.30]Full blast.
[28:32.70]5.1.
[28:32.72]No, 5.4, right?
[28:33.04]Got him.
[28:33.36]Yes!
[28:38.55]One stamina.
[28:43.66]I'll drink to that.
[28:44.70]That's a good tea.
[28:56.59]I got him.
[28:58.99]Brilliant boxing.
[29:00.23]Took him out.
[29:06.37]Such sword play.
[29:07.38]Try again?
[29:07.90]No way.
[29:09.16]That was very lucky.
[29:11.14]It was.
[29:11.44]Alrighty, so let me say, uh... Thank you to the bits that just rolled in.
[29:18.52]No decision is permanent.
[29:19.48]Click the rewind button.
[29:21.52]Thanks a lot, Sylvanas.
[29:23.10]Squidward again with 200 bits.
[29:25.43]Fuck you, Snake.
[29:27.44]Thank you, Gigi Baby, Kuse, Benji Menji.
[29:32.36]Sizzlebred with that 50 bucks in the middle of that fight.
[29:35.58]Damn, dude, dropping the real, dropping the real bucks.
[29:38.95]And then FrozenBanana, thanks for the sub.
[29:41.07]And AlexDS1, thank you for subscribing.
[29:43.17]And DaCakes, DaCakers.
[29:46.25]Thanks, dude.
[29:48.03]And I believe that's everybody.
[29:49.47]Well, FakeySnakey, subscribed as well.
[29:51.25]And Sponjay and Falkanth for 11 months.
[29:55.82]Lorag is really helpful in that fight.
[29:57.28]Yeah, I know, really.
[29:59.17]By the way, your name is Anal Goblin.
[30:03.59]Thanks for the three bucks, dude.
[30:06.01]Alright, we did it.
[30:07.99]Continue.
[30:12.62]Congratulations!
[30:14.08]You have defeated the first of the seven serpents of Manfang.
[30:17.90]You feel a new spring in your step.
[30:19.96]One serpent has been defeated.
[30:22.10]Soon, the rest will fall.
[30:25.61]You've also found one new clue.
[30:33.29]Day five.
[30:34.43]You become weak and you defeated the fire serpent, the first of the seven serpents.
[30:40.47]Now do that six more fucking times.
[30:45.66]You get to your feet once more.
[30:47.88]You must keep going, but your exertions have left you weak.
[30:50.84]Perhaps you should simply rest here for a few hours and regain some strength.
[30:54.82]Rest.
[30:56.10]Oh, I think the air serpent attacks you now.
[30:58.68]This is the seven serpents of dumpus.
[31:08.00]One out of seven face fall.
[31:10.95]One of the seven is better than zero out of seven.
[31:13.95]You squat down and try to relax your body and mind.
[31:16.59]You feel a great peace.
[31:19.85]You have become weak.
[31:21.01]Glorious trumpets.
[31:26.16]I just burped so loud.
[31:27.44]I'm glad I caught that.
[31:29.52]I muted so quickly and it was just like... Alright, hours pass.
[31:35.91]The rising winds tug at your hair and cloak.
[31:37.61]The time has come for your journey to continue.
[31:39.59]Well, that was the fire serpent.
[31:46.87]Flanker would be proud.
[31:49.09]Thanks, Tyler.
[31:55.14]Um...
[31:59.19]I'm going to go this way because this bridge is here now.
[32:00.95]I feel like it's... Yeah, I pointed this in that direction to get the time.
[32:06.60]So I could go... This is cut right across, man.
[32:12.38]Congrats, Jeremy.
[32:13.02]You're rich now.
[32:17.52]Great victories deserve great belches.
[32:20.66]You weren't supposed to tell us you burped if you muted it.
[32:23.74]Yeah, that's right.
[32:26.48]You are correct on that.
[32:27.39]I don't know why I'm doing that.
[32:29.11]Hide.
[32:57.66]You drop down behind a nearby outcrop to watch as the shape approaches.
[33:01.26]It is a small, two-legged creature about half your size, but it seems to be approaching at a remarkable rate.
[33:08.53]Thank you, Mr. Sandman.
[33:11.75]Hail!
[33:13.45]Keep hiding.
[33:16.09]What the hell is that?
[33:18.50]You stay low and out of sight, allowing the creature to approach.
[33:21.34]As it gets close, you see it as a small gnome-like creature with dark skin and ugly features.
[33:26.78]Its little legs move at an incredible rate, and it helps itself along with a walking stick.
[33:35.92]Uh... Uh... I'm just... He's going real fast.
[33:44.71]And he might be a sorcerer.
[33:46.69]I gotta be careful here.
[33:52.05]I'm getting out of the bush and I'm going to stand in front of him.
[33:54.83]You stand and approach the creature who pauses to regard you.
[33:57.41]Silently, you wonder to yourself if the creature is a friend or foe.
[34:01.89]Have it whichever way you like, shouts the creature in a squeaky voice.
[34:04.88]Wait, what?
[34:05.56]Is that squeaky enough?
[34:07.98]Congratulations to the newborn baby sub-sandwich foe.
[34:10.64]Thank you, Megalomaniacal Khalid.
[34:18.09]What do you mean?
[34:19.51]The gnome smiles.
[34:20.89]If it's friend, show friendship.
[34:23.23]And if it is foe, then be gone and get out of my way.
[34:27.20]Oh, he's got a skull cap on, doesn't he?
[34:31.48]Um.
[34:34.75]I'll be your friend, you suggest?
[34:37.33]Very good.
[34:38.51]Then it narrows its eyes.
[34:40.35]Now prove it.
[34:41.91]It holds out a grubby hand, expecting some kind of gift.
[34:47.20]I think I can spare a coin for this guy.
[34:48.88]Here, take a coin.
[34:50.24]You take out a gold piece and hand it to the creature who throws it immediately to one side.
[34:54.58]Rubbishy metal.
[34:56.06]If I want metal, don't you think I can find my own?
[34:58.78]You pick the coin back up once more.
[35:04.46]Hmm.
[35:07.98]Shake his hand.
[35:08.66]I don't know.
[35:11.68]I mean, what items would I give him?
[35:14.30]My items are too precious.
[35:20.62]Alright, guys.
[35:21.00]You're going to have to decide.
[35:22.28]Do I give him nothing or give him something?
[35:25.24]Because I actually don't know which one of these I want to do.
[35:29.30]So, struggle.me.
[35:31.85]Hmm.
[35:35.49]Where'd it go?
[35:40.05]There we go.
[35:41.91]Give item.
[35:45.30]Don't.
[35:48.24]There you go.
[35:48.74]Give item or don't.
[35:54.73]And then let me close that.
[35:56.61]And hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
[35:58.51]There you go.
[35:59.23]Please vote.
[36:01.01]First vote of the day.
[36:04.50]Give item or don't.
[36:11.68]Hello, hello, hello.
[36:13.18]Don't.
[36:13.48]Alright.
[36:18.81]It looks like give item seems to be winning by a fair margin at the moment.
[36:30.30]Yeah, it seems.
[36:31.04]I don't know if don't can come back.
[36:36.68]It's about 20% difference right now.
[36:42.67]Why do you guys want to lose an item?
[36:45.21]Maybe he'll give us something cool.
[36:48.59]Is there a name my reason comes up as anonymous when I do bits or is it because of the anal part?
[36:54.92]You know, I have no idea.
[36:57.35]I'm gonna maybe it's like a Twitch alerts thing maybe like it's catching your first name as anal and they're like nope I don't know maybe there's a filter I'm not sure I don't have I didn't put a filter on it so I don't even like I'm too stupid to do that yeah it's going on squifty thanks for the sub dude alright five seconds five four

[37:51.55]So, give it an item.
[37:54.57]You look in your pack for something you were willing to offer to the gnome.
[37:58.52]Goblin's tooth, a pebble, sun jewel, something else.
[38:03.12]Wait, is this guy a goblin?
[38:05.58]Hey, do you want like a tooth from somebody that you probably know?
[38:09.50]No, he's a gnome, okay.
[38:11.94]I believe I have like four goblin's teeth.
[38:15.96]So, I'm okay losing a goblin's tooth.
[38:19.08]I have three more.
[38:22.26]Give him a pebble?
[38:23.99]No, no, no.
[38:25.05]I can explode shit with the pebbles.
[38:31.53]Give pebble, give pebble, give him the pebble.
[38:33.67]The pebble?
[38:35.35]Don't you guys want to blow shit up?
[38:42.18]Wow, unanimously people are saying pebble.
[38:46.20]I don't know why.
[38:50.85]I haven't even used gob yet.
[38:52.13]That's true.
[38:53.93]Yeah, I haven't even used this spell.
[38:55.45]This spell doesn't even... No, I'm giving him a goblin's tooth.
[38:59.14]You hand over a goblin's tooth.
[39:00.56]The gnome shrugs, accepting your gift.
[39:02.32]There we go.
[39:03.48]Thank you, I suppose.
[39:05.70]As the creature speaks, its voice begins to shift and change from the gruff croaking of the gnome to the softer tones of a middle-aged woman.
[39:13.20]I'll do you the favor of being honest about myself in return, the creature says.
[39:17.79]And before your eyes, the gnome transforms into a tall woman dressed in long purple robes.
[39:23.99]Who are you?
[39:28.05]I am Dintainter.
[39:30.05]Dintainter of the Steps.
[39:32.56]Others call me the Sham.
[39:34.40]She bows.
[39:37.42]Uh, why are you traveling as a gnome?
[39:39.10]What?
[39:40.87]You're a fucking boss, Yerma, mate.
[39:43.22]Keep up that quality banter.
[39:46.38]I'll try.
[39:47.22]Thank you, Kwisant.
[39:48.66]And thank you, Anal Globlin, for another hundred bits.
[39:52.60]Why did you give him my tooth?
[39:55.82]Uh-oh.
[39:56.02]Why do you travel in disguise?
[39:58.34]Only those without a purpose can afford to travel as they are.
[40:01.20]Those for whom the destination matters must travel in disguise.
[40:05.53]She smiles.
[40:06.41]As do you, I think.
[40:07.63]You travel a bit big.
[40:10.23]How am I fucking this whole lady's voice up?
[40:11.81]I don't know.
[40:14.06]I need to kill the seven serpents.
[40:18.06]Many have had that intention.
[40:19.66]Very few know their weaknesses.
[40:22.30]But you know them.
[40:24.06]The serpents' weaknesses are the most heavily guarded secrets in the whole of Mampang.
[40:28.43]Of course I know them.
[40:29.53]Or at least I know two.
[40:32.45]I would be grateful if you told me what they are.
[40:35.73]I'm certain you would, she replies.
[40:37.96]Know then that the moon serpent cannot abide fire.
[40:41.62]Secondly, the serpent of water is destroyed by oil.
[40:47.02]Is the fire serpent's weakness water?
[40:49.29]Am I that brainless to know that I already killed him?
[40:55.49]Apparently I am.
[40:57.15]Thanks, uh, thanks, Elvin.
[41:00.27]Oh, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I What else do you know?
[41:08.40]Sounds like the woman is constantly switching between gnome and woman.
[41:13.14]I know that your lack of gratitude is unbecoming, she answers, and I should transform you into a toad.
[41:19.57]Where can I find a seven servants?
[41:23.13]I just keep changing the subject.
[41:24.39]What kind of sorceress are you anyways?
[41:27.29]A busy one.
[41:28.49]Why do you waste my time with stupid questions?
[41:31.60]We're going to find the seven serpents.
[41:33.38]One's off to hide in the waters of Lake Ilcarla.
[41:36.06]It means to pick you off as you cross.
[41:38.16]But it will wait until you are alone.
[41:40.28]If you travel with the ferryman, you will most likely be safe.
[41:43.94]She shakes her head.
[41:45.16]If that's any help, I don't suppose it is.
[41:48.34]Enough questions.
[41:49.86]You turn away, losing interest.
[41:51.24]She turns to leave, begins to weave her spell around herself once more.
[41:55.41]See you later, bye!
[41:56.81]You wave her away, keen to continue your journey.
[41:59.01]Dentainter becomes an ugly creature once more, and a moment later, has whisked herself away across the plains and is gone.
[42:04.97]You have found four new clues, and other clues have been updated.
[42:11.68]My power and internet keep getting down by Matthew.
[42:13.82]Even if I cannot watch you, know that I love you.
[42:16.94]Well, thanks a lot, man.
[42:18.70]And thank you to Pugs and Ponies for the subscription.
[42:22.46]Thank you.
[42:26.57]Oh, it marks it on the map.
[42:28.10]Okay, that's cool.
[42:29.96]So, this is the Water Serpent.
[42:32.22]Water Serpent is in this lake.
[42:34.40]And if I go here by myself, he will appear.
[42:37.46]If I go there with the Ferryman, he won't appear.
[42:39.41]Because he's scared because he is a little wuss.
[42:42.07]And will only fight me one-on-one.
[42:43.91]And I... Yeah.
[42:46.35]Just the Ferryman will whack you with a fucking stick.
[42:49.21]He's not a threat.
[42:53.79]In the books, you couldn't beat book four without impressing that lady and getting the best result from her.
[42:58.27]Are you serious?
[43:00.37]Wow.
[43:01.69]That sounds kind of insane.
[43:05.89]What's this?
[43:06.31]I want to see what this is up the slope.
[43:12.03]Oh, I think this is just barely, like, in between.
[43:14.83]It's not... Yeah, it's not shining over here.
[43:16.11]If it was shining over here, there's probably something here in the past.
[43:41.49]Later, we're going to have to come back.
[43:47.29]This path winds this way and that until it reaches the foot of a stone staircase that climbs to the summit.
[43:53.19]Well, what counters... What counters the water serpent?
[43:59.96]Oil.
[44:00.76]Do I have oil?
[44:05.40]Stone, dust, galehorn, ring, bobbins, beeswax...
[44:12.19]Essence of bark.
[44:14.07]Poison.
[44:17.05]Beer.
[44:19.78]When am I gonna get oil?
[44:23.30]Thanks, royal duck.
[44:29.28]Oil up that serpent.
[44:31.69]Alright, hold on a second.
[44:32.77]Can I, like... I'm gonna rewind to right here.
[44:38.63]So we can get rid of the message.
[44:41.95]Okay.
[44:42.65]So, like, that message is gone.
[44:46.33]I'm gonna get a lot of shit for that, aren't I?
[44:49.07]Essence of Bark is oil?
[44:50.21]Okay, it is oil.
[44:53.59]At least that's not on the screen anymore.
[44:55.37]People are gonna freak the fuck out over that.
[44:57.05]No, rewind.
[45:06.64]Towards the village.
[45:07.32]What village are they talking about?
[45:12.45]I didn't even rewind.
[45:15.27]I rewound to where I was standing.
[45:19.77]There was no rewind.
[45:22.23]Rewinding were to be if I went like this and pressed the button.
[45:26.30]I didn't even rewind.
[45:30.54]Unwatchable.
[45:31.56]Lorag was right.
[45:36.64]I'm going... No.
[45:37.58]Screw this.
[45:37.96]I'm going across the bridge.
[45:44.55]Wait, what?
[45:48.26]No rewinds.
[45:51.28]Loser sucks.
[45:53.14]Oh, this loser sucks.
[45:58.85]That wasn't a rewind.
[45:59.99]Everybody take back your bits.
[46:05.93]He's a fucking cheater.
[46:11.26]A set of well-carved steps lead up the mountainside.
[46:13.49]The sun is dropping down to the west.
[46:14.87]It will be dark soon.
[46:16.51]At the peak of the mountain is a sudden plateau looking down across a fetid, swampy valley to the east.
[46:23.69]But you may not need to tramp through them as a magnificent stone bridge spans outwards from this peak.
[46:30.29]Am I having contractions yet?
[46:32.19]Not for like another month.
[46:34.17]But thank you very much.
[46:37.02]Um, let's go.
[46:39.11]Approach the bridge, who cares.
[46:41.15]Away eastwards, you stride forward, but a figure emerges from a low hut by the head of the bridge and blocks your path.
[46:48.73]Announce myself.
[46:50.69]Ho there!
[46:51.45]Greetings!
[46:52.41]The figure turns to you, leaning heavily on its stick.
[46:55.14]You cannot believe your eyes.
[46:56.88]It is Vankas, the strange guardian whose bridge you crossed in the Shumanadi Hills.
[47:02.40]But what is he doing here?
[47:05.99]Wait a minute, is this the guy that I threw in the water?
[47:09.63]As you see him, he sees you.
[47:11.41]He does not seem to recognize you.
[47:14.52]An ugly sort.
[47:16.02]What brings you here?
[47:17.72]If Vankess's bridge you wish to cross, prepared be for dismay and fear.
[47:23.46]It is definitely Vankess.
[47:28.28]Oh, that's the right guy.
[47:29.44]The guy that's to the right.
[47:30.50]Okay.
[47:31.62]Do you not remember me?
[47:33.47]The creature shuffles closer until his dank breath fills your nostrils.
[47:38.99]Van Cassie does not forget.
[47:41.47]Except for those he has not yet met.
[47:46.00]Huh.
[47:47.30]Oh, because this is in the past.
[47:48.90]Okay.
[47:51.92]What lies in the valley below?
[47:57.89]Martian mud, a tower death.
[48:00.15]Above it all, a drop to catch the breath.
[48:02.94]The bridge keeper pauses to scratch his swollen right eye.
[48:07.18]Approach the bridge.
[48:08.84]This is my bridge.
[48:09.98]It spans a rift.
[48:11.26]To pass, you must provide a gift.
[48:14.31]The sudden image of a sun jewel pops into your head.
[48:28.25]Tap him!
[48:30.44]Consulting the stars, you bind the magic, gathering a bolt of lightning in your palm.
[48:33.60]But Vancast pulls out some kind of jeweled medallion in return and begins to hover up into the air.
[48:39.04]A moment later, he is on the ground, and the lightning in your palm is gone.
[48:43.91]Curses like chickens will round in your flock, lest you learn that every spell you cast is by another block'd.
[48:54.33]You recognize the spell he cast, so the spell of lightning is negated by levitation.
[49:08.86]Blow him up!
[49:14.74]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[49:23.66]Zap him again?
[49:24.34]If I zap him again, I die.
[49:38.07]Create illusions.
[49:38.87]I can't do that.
[49:42.85]I can't do tell.
[49:43.49]I don't have the skull.
[49:45.83]Really, the only things I can do, I can do... I can cause stupidity.
[49:53.21]I can make him an idiot.
[49:55.01]Although he might counter it.
[49:56.01]Dude, this guy's a sorcerer too.
[49:58.07]If he can counter zap, I'm sure he can counter other shit.
[50:02.70]Double tap zap.
[50:06.88]Alright, it's either throw a grenade at him or try to make him an idiot.
[50:12.31]Go for it.
[50:15.27]You gather the stars until you design around you, but Vankast raises one arm on which is hung a bone bracelet.
[50:21.47]He utters something under his breath, and a moment later your spell has evaporated.
[50:25.89]Vankast shakes his head.
[50:27.73]If you will not learn the rule, you must expect to be taken for a cretin.
[50:34.08]His spell is... I'm learning!
[50:35.06]Look, I'm learning all this shit.
[50:38.96]Alright, fine.
[50:39.46]I'm gonna... The magic of stupidity counters illusion.
[50:45.22]He's gonna counter everything, Haggle.
[50:47.94]Your price is too high.
[50:49.66]VanCast shakes his head without interest.
[50:52.09]Then the hunchback looks up sharply.
[50:55.05]Unless a simpler price you'd gladly pay.
[50:57.41]An arm, a leg, a finger, pray?
[51:00.32]Jesus.
[51:06.84]Take my leg?
[51:13.86]Am I going to be able to play the rest of the game?
[51:15.66]I don't think I'm going to be able to play the rest of the game.
[51:22.71]I'm going to be crawling around.
[51:29.75]No, no, no.
[51:31.85]Okay.
[51:33.21]You guys want another decision?
[51:34.53]You guys can make this decision.
[51:40.72]Is the rest of this game going to be ruined?
[51:43.75]Let's find out.
[51:51.59]Leg.
[51:53.15]Finger.
[51:55.12]No.
[52:00.88]And here we are.
[52:04.94]Pray to Lorag that we don't have to do anything drastic, but I feel like a lot of people want to vote on this.
[52:21.58]Thank you, Limeade911 and FML759 for your subscriptions.
[52:26.48]Thank you to Psychoblat2015 for eight months.
[52:30.62]Tall Lucario for seven months.
[52:32.37]Glitchbound, the Royal Duck, for subscribing.
[52:35.07]Thank you guys.
[52:38.13]And it looks like we're going legless for the rest of the game.
[52:45.07]What am I going to do?
[52:53.98]What's going to happen to me?
[52:57.34]What's going to happen to me?
[53:01.44]Is this where it ends?
[53:04.92]Does my sorcery playthrough end right here?
[53:07.50]Right now?
[53:13.46]Yeah, I think so.
[53:15.02]Thank you, Soupy.
[53:21.28]10 seconds.
[53:26.72]Never skip leg day.
[53:28.56]There's no coming back from this.
[53:29.74]The leg is the winner.
[53:31.22]Thank you all for voting.
[53:33.72]He's taking the leg.
[53:37.60]Okay.
[53:39.06]Poll is closed.
[53:40.78]Beer.
[53:42.60]Thanks, XPTV.
[53:43.64]Take my leg.
[53:45.66]You declare with vigor.
[53:47.80]VanCast nods and strides forward, raising his staff, which seems to flatten to a hard, steely edge.
[53:55.37]Huh.
[54:00.66]Brace myself.
[54:03.40]You grit your teeth and brace yourself.
[54:05.24]The sharp-edged staff rises up and then slices down to meet the bones of your leg.
[54:15.09]Close my eyes.
[54:17.13]You scrunch your eyes shut, but nothing happens.
[54:20.29]You keep... You peek your eyes open.
[54:22.19]The bridgekeeper is nodding.
[54:24.87]The price is fixed.
[54:26.11]No less and no greater.
[54:28.17]He declares his satisfaction.
[54:30.17]Your leg is mine.
[54:31.65]I will collect it later.
[54:34.78]And that is that.
[54:35.54]With a last clear nod, the hunchback steps from the bridge and back into his hut, leaving the way clear for you to pass.
[54:44.95]What?
[54:48.03]What does that mean?
[54:52.95]He's gonna like come get the leg at some point?
[54:57.69]Hey, thanks, man.
[55:00.72]Alright.
[55:04.44]It would be extremely painful.
[55:07.81]Well, that worked out.
[55:11.09]Didn't even lose any stamina.
[55:15.63]Yeah, anytime he can basically walk up and just take the leg whenever he wants.
[55:20.15]It's gonna just disappear.
[55:23.24]You step onto the bridge.
[55:24.08]The sun is almost set and the sky has turned a deep purple.
[55:26.78]Soon, it will be dark.
[55:28.76]The flagstones laid along the bridge top form the straightest, smoothest road you've ever seen.
[55:33.57]Finer even than the King's Road of Analand.
[55:37.23]Look down.
[55:38.62]You cast a look over the side of the walkway and your head immediately begins to swim.
[55:42.92]The drop is immense.
[55:44.40]The ground lost far below in mist.
[55:46.90]How was this bridge built?
[55:48.44]How could it ever be repaired?
[55:53.76]And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we are at the pretty much one hour mark of being live.
[55:58.87]So this is, we're in like the dead zone now.
[56:01.89]This stream might just turn off because of the internet.
[56:05.47]So we're like in the, it's been an hour.
[56:07.71]We're in the no man's land for Comcast right now.
[56:11.41]Just want to make that, you know, bring that up again.
[56:14.21]So if it happens, sorry.
[56:16.73]But I hope we can get at least another couple hours in.
[56:22.20]That's like my ad.
[56:24.15]Let's pause for two seconds for station identification.
[56:26.75]Yes, the stream's gonna fucking die in like an hour.
[56:31.53]Back to your regularly scheduled programming.
[56:33.21]Head east.
[56:38.93]Wait.
[56:39.35]Oh, this is on the bridge.
[56:40.04]Okay, cool.
[56:43.00]Wait a second.
[57:12.84]Oh, I don't have the rest of the bridge fixed.
[57:17.02]Shit.
[57:18.58]Okay.
[57:19.16]Shit, shit, shit.
[57:21.00]Let's go to the ledge.
[57:23.71]Let's peer over.
[57:29.51]Look down.
[57:39.03]You look over the edge, but there's nothing to be seen.
[57:41.07]Merely fallen rocks and empty air.
[57:47.13]Why would I do this?
[57:48.35]Fine, let's throw it.
[57:49.43]You toss a gold piece over the edge of the bridge.
[57:51.17]It turns and turns in the air and eventually disappears into the trees.
[57:54.29]The drop is dizzying.
[57:55.89]You step back from the edge.
[57:58.86]Why did I do that?
[57:59.56]I just threw away a dollar.
[58:04.44]For no reason.
[58:07.72]Sighed.
[58:11.07]You go over to the side of the bridge by one of the shattered pedestals.
[58:14.41]The stone rail is worn and old, but the pillar on which the pedestal stands appears to be intact, leading all the way down to the ground.
[58:22.64]Hm.
[58:27.54]Hm.
[58:31.20]I don't really have stamina for a spell.
[58:32.89]Let's just see what I can do here.
[58:35.83]Zap.
[58:41.02]No, this is Zen.
[58:41.79]It's floating.
[58:42.29]He wants me to float.
[58:45.23]So obviously I can't float in the air, but what is X?
[58:48.11]X what?
[58:51.93]Sense danger.
[58:54.73]Don't think I need to do that, considering I know it's a far drop.
[59:05.84]I can't do anything really here.
[59:12.70]Nope.
[59:13.32]I only had like three options.
[59:14.68]Now I'm gonna have to climb down.
[59:19.89]Climb on the pillar.
[59:20.65]Let's do it.
[59:22.77]Harden your mouth, you clamber up onto the top of the broken pillar.
[59:27.08]I'm gonna fucking drop to my death.
[59:30.98]Sense height.
[59:32.81]Your foot dislodges a stone and it disappears silently over the side, falling without noise.
[59:37.68]Perhaps a distant snap when it finally hits the trees.
[59:40.86]Is the climb really necessary?
[59:43.88]Look down?
[59:44.76]Don't look down.
[59:46.06]Look down.
[59:47.28]You peer down the length of the pillar.
[59:48.56]The stone is dotted with holes.
[59:50.20]Patches of moss and small shrubs grow from many of them and would most likely rip away if you trusted your weight to them.
[59:56.52]To climb the whole way seems quite impossible.
[60:05.88]Let's go.
[60:07.00]We can do it.
[60:08.66]One foot, then another.
[60:10.10]You shift your leg grip, keeping your right hold as tight as you can manage.
[60:14.39]You try to ignore the wind plucking at your cloak.
[60:18.35]Alright, Lorag.
[60:20.61]Lorag, this is the... Pray to Lorag.
[60:22.75]Come on, Lorag.
[60:24.81]You close your eyes and make a prayer.
[60:26.71]Lorag replies with a bitter laugh.
[60:30.48]I don't see how I could help even if I wanted to.
[60:33.80]Except to say that you should be looking to the stars and not to me.
[60:37.60]Some wizard you are.
[60:42.41]There's nothing to do but climb.
[60:44.07]You find footholds for your feet and begin to long descent towards the trees.
[60:52.47]I love how Lorag gives you advice.
[60:54.61]Real advice.
[60:58.59]In an insult.
[61:03.01]halfway down halfway there come on halfway down you pause for breath holding your weight in tight to the stone you are barely halfway keep going but waiting makes your arms and figures burn more you start moving once more making slow agonizing progress muscles burning from the strain hurry get down there halfway down your arms give out and you tumble
[61:31.92]That's it.
[61:33.20]That's it.
[61:34.62]That's it.
[61:37.23]That's it.
[61:37.55]I'm dead.
[61:37.87]You fall to your death.
[61:39.15]It's over.
[61:40.99]That's it?
[61:42.41]One sentence?
[61:45.71]That's all I get is one sentence.
[61:47.15]Okay.
[61:49.01]Climb the bridge.
[61:51.71]Halfway down, your arms get out and you tumble.
[61:53.23]I can't rewind from anywhere.
[61:57.55]I have to go back to here.
[62:01.13]This doesn't count as a rewind because this is where I died.
[62:03.19]Yeah, okay.
[62:07.63]This is right before death.
[62:10.33]Keep climbing.
[62:12.05]Okay, go back up.
[62:14.29]I can't go back up.
[62:17.69]You die.
[62:18.03]I have to go like all the way back up.
[62:25.97]To here.
[62:30.50]Is the climb necessary?
[62:31.60]Don't look down.
[62:32.26]I can't do that, apparently.
[62:34.66]So I died.
[62:37.42]Back up.
[62:40.54]Nice rewind.
[62:47.53]Deadly tumble.
[62:49.77]Alright, I gotta make... I can't do it.
[62:55.49]I can't do this.
[62:56.29]I have to... I can't do it.
[62:58.47]So I have to go back.
[63:01.44]That's 14 deaths.
[63:02.36]I said I wanted to beat this whole game with 10 deaths.
[63:04.28]That's not going to work.
[63:08.56]Bridge has to be completed with another pillar.
[63:16.04]You stride easily across the bridge feeling like Pox, god of rumors and whispers, who walks between the stars at night.
[63:21.84]It is a great pity whoever built this did not think to build a bridge all the way across Lake Ilkala.
[63:26.97]Arrogance!
[63:28.06]I hope you slip and fall!
[63:30.18]The moon sets, more stars appear.
[63:33.92]We gotta go back.
[63:35.16]There's nowhere to go.
[63:35.80]I lost a leg for nothing.
[63:43.03]Good trade for one of your fucking legs.
[63:44.37]Yeah, I know.
[63:46.31]And now at least I can cross it when I need to.
[63:50.10]You cross the immense bridge and reach the top of the western mountain once more.
[63:52.80]The night air is cold.
[63:53.80]The air is like ice.
[63:55.46]There is no sign of Vankis anywhere.
[63:57.12]I'm going to look in his hut.
[64:01.56]Overcome by curiosity, you approach the hut.
[64:03.48]It takes two circles to find there is no apparent door at all.
[64:07.82]Knock.
[64:10.43]You tap once, then quickly stop as you feel your skin sticking to the hut walls.
[64:13.93]There are now grazed patches on your knuckles.
[64:17.08]Looking more closely, you see the hut itself seems to be not canvas, but a thick layer of skin.
[64:21.16]Yeah, I guess I could sleep here.
[64:25.56]In the skin hut.
[64:28.18]You lie down in Vankis' hut, and despite the arms sticking out of the cloth, you feel strangely safe.
[64:34.68]Removing your pack on the rocky ground, you try to settle despite the cold.
[64:37.80]You have eaten nothing today, but your pack is empty and you cannot eat.
[64:42.55]Close my eyes.
[64:44.47]You see him guarded here, and you do not dream.
[64:49.06]You've grown weaker, lost a little gold, walked on the ancient Baklan's bridge, and met Dintainter of the slopes.
[64:57.75]That is gross, man.
[65:01.27]Call out for Vankis in the morning.
[65:03.45]There's no reply, and your voice is carried away by the endless wind.
[65:07.97]Okay, let's go.
[65:11.73]Um...
[65:18.09]Maybe I should take this one off and go here in the present day.
[65:22.19]I'm going to do that.
[65:27.99]Let's go down here.
[65:28.61]I'm going to turn this one away to like over here or something.
[65:39.03]The slope is windswept.
[65:40.39]You trudge onwards.
[65:41.43]A few clouds boil in the sky.
[65:43.41]The slopes of the mountain burst into a sudden of color.
[65:45.91]Ropes slung with prayer fangs and all colors crisscrossed overhead.
[65:49.57]Be warned.
[65:50.87]This is a place of considerable danger.
[65:52.87]Loregg.
[65:55.12]Be warned.
[65:56.56]This is a place of considerable danger.
[65:59.32]Loregg actually helping me.
[66:02.09]But thank you, Allie.
[66:04.26]What danger?
[66:05.80]You demand.
[66:07.54]Something truly terrible.
[66:09.24]You should turn and run right now while you still can.
[66:14.34]Prayer fangs.
[66:18.67]Prayer flags.
[66:22.93]Thanks a lot to your dog.
[66:25.17]Well, okay, Lorag.
[66:27.01]I'm not going to listen to Lorag.
[66:29.95]Because there's probably something cool around here.
[66:33.37]Look around.
[66:35.07]What is so special about this place that warrants the decoration?
[66:39.14]Look around the rocks.
[66:39.84]Let's see.
[66:40.88]Let's sense danger.
[66:43.10]Let's see if Lorag was right.
[66:44.08]You can just grow huge, dude.
[66:53.78]Thanks, Saliva.
[66:57.70]There's maybe a door around here I can open.
[67:04.97]sap.
[67:06.63]Cause depression on myself again, no thanks.
[67:09.45]We're gonna be safe.
[67:09.99]We're gonna sense danger.
[67:14.49]You craft the enchantment and Lorag replies directly in your brain, this place is extremely dangerous.
[67:20.20]Though there's not... Oh, yeah.
[67:22.72]For a second I thought I was saying that.
[67:23.98]Though there's something in the tonem which makes you think he might be hiding something.
[67:31.22]Yeah, he's fucking lying to me.
[67:35.07]You scout around the rocks and crevices at the edge of the path but find nothing in particular.
[67:38.45]The flags flap in the rustle of the morning breeze.
[67:43.33]Look up at the flags.
[67:45.77]You look up at the flags which cross and recross the path, suspended from tall wooden poles set into the Earth.
[67:51.32]It must have taken the effort of several people to erect this place, but what for?
[67:56.10]The lines of flags form a triangle with one corner higher up on the mountain and two on either side of the path.
[68:06.35]Investigate the top corner.
[68:09.47]You trace the flags up the slope, clambering over the rocks until you reach a pole set higher into which several lines are tied.
[68:15.82]The pole is carved with the symbol of an open eye.
[68:23.62]You touch the symbol of the open eye, but it is just wood.
[68:27.35]Nothing happens.
[68:27.91]You rejoin the path.
[68:31.17]Bottom corners.
[68:33.74]You follow the flag to the bottom left corner, where several lines converge on a single pole.
[68:38.22]This pole is also carved, with the symbol of a circle in which is a single closed eye.
[68:43.38]The pole on the other side of the path is identical.
[68:46.62]Those two eyes touch it.
[68:50.11]You touch the symbol of the closed eye and nothing happens, but you feel suddenly connected as though the sky above had split open and a great presence was watching you.
[68:59.20]Lorax's voice mutters in your mind, Take your hand away!
[69:02.90]This is the thing I feared!
[69:08.75]Look up at the sky.
[69:11.96]You turn your head to the heavens and have the sudden, giddy feeling that you are falling upwards through the clouds and into the stars in the depths of the very night.
[69:19.92]But your body has not moved, and only a weight has been lifted from your shoulders.
[69:24.72]The sneering voice of Lorag becomes quiet in your mind.
[69:27.74]In its place, there is nothing, only silence.
[69:31.14]The silence in your mind is incredible.
[69:33.68]You snatch back your hand, and the curious sensation disappears instantly.
[69:37.60]See you later, Lorag.
[69:40.78]Touch the symbol again.
[69:43.39]You touch the symbol of the closed eye once more.
[69:44.99]Nothing happens this time.
[69:45.82]You lift your hand away.
[69:46.62]You scramble back to the track.
[69:48.82]Go touch the other one again.
[69:50.02]Touch the other one.
[69:50.50]Touch the other one.
[69:51.52]Touch the symbol.
[69:53.56]You touch the symbol of the open eye.
[69:54.84]With a sudden rush, you feel your soul filling as though your mouth had been opened and a stream was pouring in.
[69:59.66]Suddenly, swimming by your side is the dolphin.
[70:02.25]You stumble back to the path.
[70:08.52]Dolphin!
[70:09.92]Quick and carefree, the dolphin is happy to leap and skim his way through the world.
[70:13.98]He is brave, but not rash.
[70:16.63]Dolphins with us again, boys.
[70:18.93]Boys and girls, we got the dolphin back.
[70:21.71]See you later, Lorag.
[70:24.39]See, I knew it.
[70:26.15]The way you, like... Lorag is a shithead.
[70:29.52]He's gone.
[70:33.78]Nice.
[70:34.96]That just saved the whole run.
[70:41.47]No, no, don't touch it.
[70:42.47]Take your hand off.
[70:44.43]Yeah, fuck you, Lorag.
[70:46.35]Get, like, sucked up to hell.
[70:49.33]Or sucked down to hell.
[70:52.25]Lorag didn't do anything wrong.
[70:54.89]He was a prick.
[70:59.59]Uh, okay.
[71:01.62]What else can I do here?
[71:02.40]I want to make sure I don't miss anything.
[71:09.78]Good thing I didn't do Protect from Magic.
[71:12.20]Do you remember playing this like a VHS tape, rewinding all the time?
[71:21.92]How dramatic the rating of the dolphin return was?
[71:25.15]It was very dramatic.
[71:26.13]I didn't expect that.
[71:33.59]I'm going to save my stamina.
[71:34.73]There's no reason to use it.
[71:35.59]I'm going to move on.
[71:39.07]You turn your attention back to the path still reeling with joy at the return of your spirit guide.
[71:46.44]Hell yeah.
[71:48.30]Back to business.
[71:51.06]But thank you, MasterSpots, the Grump, and the Royal Duck.
[71:54.40]Thanks for the 50 bits.
[71:58.08]Now here's the question.
[72:00.62]I want to turn this over there.
[72:01.82]Yeah, we're gonna go down back over here again.
[72:05.69]Whoa, what the hell was that?
[72:10.13]You climb down the mountain and join the old road the sun continues to climb.
[72:14.27]I'm going to point this... I wasn't up here before.
[72:24.71]Okay, I'm turning this one... Actually, it's going to be this one.
[72:29.12]This one's going to move away.
[72:30.14]I'm going to turn this one to over here because I want this to be the present day.
[72:40.12]He was a prick, so you burned down his city and sucked him into hell.
[72:44.34]Yeah.
[72:47.09]Let that be a lesson.
[72:48.47]Don't be a dick.
[72:50.39]Maybe you won't get your city burnt down and sucked your spirit into hell.
[73:00.13]Alright.
[73:01.06]We're at the tower again.
[73:04.16]I want to go and change these.
[73:10.10]We've always been here before.
[73:11.00]You guys know the deal.
[73:13.63]I'm just going right to the top.
[73:16.53]And we're going to touch the blue crystal.
[73:18.35]Oh, adjust the beam, actually.
[73:19.33]Okay, so this one, I had it pointed this way.
[73:25.50]So, I wonder what's up there in the present day.
[73:31.61]Actually, so that...
[73:34.06]I'm going to point it right there.
[73:36.20]Right there, because I want to go over here.
[73:37.50]Because I didn't get a chance to see this, did I?
[73:41.08]Or should I take it off completely?
[73:42.23]There's something there.
[73:45.25]What is there?
[73:45.67]What is that?
[73:48.53]Keep that there.
[73:50.37]Touch the crystal.
[73:50.97]Let's teleport to the other one.
[73:57.38]Move this out of the way.
[73:58.08]Adjust the beam.
[74:02.75]Now, if I move this, is that going to disappear?
[74:04.79]Oh, shit, it is.
[74:06.63]Okay, then I'm just going to go like this.
[74:10.35]Like that.
[74:12.77]So this can still be on.
[74:17.00]Like this.
[74:17.70]And I want to explore this area again.
[74:24.42]Right there.
[74:27.34]Look directly into the light.
[74:28.75]That's a little crystal.
[74:32.03]Teleport back.
[74:34.53]And I want to go up in this area in the present day.
[74:44.36]Let's make a move.
[74:48.96]Out of the tower.
[74:51.00]Find baby flanker.
[74:58.40]I'll rest in here.
[74:58.99]It's nighttime.
[75:01.19]Hours pass.
[75:01.71]You seat yourself, focusing on the breath of the sound of the wind.
[75:03.41]You feel a great calm.
[75:04.89]The sun is gone, but you are ready to move once more.
[75:08.59]Okay.
[75:09.77]This way.
[75:12.15]This way.
[75:15.58]You make your slow way across the dusty plains and the meadows to recede dry dust.
[75:19.96]God, I need to learn how to fucking read.
[75:21.94]And the meadows recede to dry dust.
[75:25.02]Another night begins.
[75:26.14]You need to rest, especially after so long walking with an empty belly.
[75:29.99]I haven't eaten in like seven days.
[75:33.41]I haven't eaten.
[75:33.95]I'm gonna die.
[75:34.79]A small patch of stones is covered by yellow moss, much like the one you tried earlier.
[75:39.91]Oh, more free moss.
[75:42.29]Are you serious?
[75:44.23]You gather up a handful of moss that is much like the... Yeah, chew it.
[75:47.89]Eat that moss.
[75:51.07]Right when I talk shit about it, I get the fucking free moss, buddy.
[75:55.65]You feel much better.
[75:56.55]Free moss.
[75:57.17]Alright, what do you guys think?
[76:03.03]Let's go this way.
[76:07.55]You drank blimberry two days ago.
[76:09.56]Yeah, well imagine like not eating food for three days and the only thing you got to drink was a green Gatorade.
[76:16.02]That's not gonna save you.
[76:16.82]That's not gonna help.
[76:18.50]You know, I haven't had solid food in like seven days, but you know, in those seven days I drank a fucking purple Gatorade.
[76:26.66]Oh, by the way, I'm dead.
[76:30.48]You walk across the plain until you meet the edge of an old road.
[76:33.18]The moon moves slowly across the sky like a lidless eye.
[76:37.06]The empty plains are cold and dark.
[76:38.66]Dust moves around your feet in waves as though you walked on the surface of a level sea.
[76:44.24]Forget to go to sleep again?
[76:45.12]You serious?
[76:47.94]Nice.
[76:49.76]This is a lonely place to rest, but perhaps a quiet one.
[76:51.94]Laying your pack down on the flagstones, you try to stretch out despite the wind.
[76:57.37]You close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you.
[77:00.07]You dream you are a young boy once more, lying on your back near the waterfalls of charberry wood.
[77:05.45]Gentle spray dusts your face.
[77:07.61]You laugh, and a droplet lands open to your mouth.
[77:11.59]But when you wipe your lips, you find there is a slug there.
[77:16.45]Spit it out.
[77:18.04]You spit it out, but more and more slugs appear until your mouth is thick with them, and you are gagging, and there seems nothing you can do to clear your mouth.
[77:24.52]What?
[77:27.15]Cast a spell.
[77:28.39]By the way, we do have access to Zap.
[77:29.37]Keep that in mind.
[78:04.40]Run, Weasley.
[78:07.12]I wish I could talk with animals.
[78:08.42]I could talk to this guy right now.
[78:11.36]What does he has?
[78:12.68]Invisibility.
[78:15.62]Okay, we can go invisible.
[78:21.01]Can't read his mind.
[78:21.89]I don't want to turn to... Raz.
[78:25.49]Sharpened blade.
[78:26.19]Okay, see the... See the sharpened blade.
[78:31.37]Oh, we're going invisible.
[78:35.57]You can't just say we can zap and not do it.
[78:43.17]Eat some slugs.
[78:47.62]I wish I could talk to him.
[78:54.58]I'm gonna go invisible.
[78:56.62]I don't think I've ever seen this spell cast in this game once.
[79:01.73]Invisible.
[79:04.86]You slip on the pearl ring and cast the spell and slowly a filmy light extends from the jewel of the ring surrounding your body.
[79:11.17]Then you creep out from underneath the confused beast.
[79:15.47]Creep away or get rid of it.
[79:18.03]Might have something on it.
[79:20.63]Kill it.
[79:22.00]You creep around behind the creature and run it quickly through.
[79:24.96]The experience is quick, risk-free, and cathartic.
[79:28.16]You wipe your sword feeling almost refreshed for the exercise.
[79:32.29]The dewy light from your pearl ring fades and disappears.
[79:34.77]I just got health by stabbing this thing.
[79:42.94]You gained considerable stamina and found no new clues.
[79:46.02]Day 7.
[79:46.24]Oh, it's because I ate.
[79:49.50]That's because I ate.
[79:52.64]You are awoken by a distant rumbling.
[79:54.46]Three shapes are approaching rapidly across the plane, throwing up a thick cloud of dust as they move.
[80:00.15]As you watch, they turn and head towards you.
[80:05.92]Hail them.
[80:07.98]You raise a hand to hail the approaching figures to discover they are tall, thick-set centaurs.
[80:16.93]Hold there, stranger, calls their pack leader, pulling himself up to a halt.
[80:21.18]We are Backland's horsemen.
[80:22.54]Greetings.
[80:26.00]Greetings.
[80:27.50]The centaur unslings a bow and fires an arrow into the dirt by your feet as a warning to come no closer.
[80:32.90]He notches a second arrow, aiming somewhat higher this time, right at your balls.
[80:38.07]Now tell me, what is your purpose here, in the living misery that is Batubak?
[80:44.97]Just passing through.
[80:47.36]I'm a traveler.
[80:48.72]The horsemen laugh.
[80:50.62]No one would be so stupid to travel here unguarded.
[80:53.86]You are a sorcerer, I think.
[80:57.93]not a sorcerer what are you talking about I'm no sorcerer dude I'm not gonna reveal myself but the centaurs are not convinced and they pace in a circle that they clearly hope will keep them out of reach one at the back canters forward this must be him he mutters not quiet enough for you not to hear the one the serpent spoke of if uh
[81:23.12]You've spoken to the serpents?
[81:25.36]Serpents, man?
[81:26.02]What are you talking about?
[81:27.14]Serpents?
[81:27.78]What are these serpents?
[81:29.80]They are no friend of ours, the centaur replies, cantering around you as he speaks.
[81:34.77]But we would not have them as our enemies either.
[81:37.17]They are fearsome.
[81:42.15]Well, perhaps we can help each other.
[81:45.44]You suggest carefully.
[81:47.23]I may have something you want.
[81:49.75]The centaur raises one thick, bushy eyebrow.
[81:54.01]And what do you suggest?
[81:58.64]I will cast a luck spell on you.
[82:03.72]Do I even have that?
[82:04.68]Does that even exist?
[82:08.36]I don't think that exists.
[82:11.33]Zap.
[82:12.71]I don't think that's a luck spell.
[82:18.42]I think I'm lying to this guy.
[82:21.60]Healing.
[82:24.77]Treasure.
[82:25.21]Pop.
[82:25.85]Dim Fall.
[82:42.94]fog mud niftel oh look at this look at this image it's a great image kin pep no potion of fire

[83:07.12]Fix.
[83:09.24]Nap.
[83:09.86]Yeah, I just haven't looked at these for a while.
[83:13.24]Sun.
[83:13.72]Kid.
[83:14.84]Rap.
[83:15.70]Yap.
[83:16.70]Zip.
[83:17.20]Far.
[83:25.57]Zed.
[83:25.89]Res.
[83:26.63]No, I don't have that.
[83:28.31]I'm just lying to this guy.
[83:32.11]I will cast a luck spell on you.
[83:35.64]A lock spell.
[83:37.80]And what do you want from us in return?
[83:42.08]Let me ride on you.
[83:49.19]That's what I want?
[83:51.47]Let me ride you once?
[83:52.89]I want a pony ride.
[83:57.48]I kind of want to pick that.
[83:59.14]Yeah.
[83:59.78]Let me ride on you.
[84:02.64]The centaur laughs.
[84:05.08]Your little human feet are too tired.
[84:07.81]And where would you like to go?
[84:08.85]I want to ride.
[84:15.69]Ride me to the serpents.
[84:20.09]The serpents have scattered across the plains, and some are rushing to Mampang to deliver their message, while others lie in wait to hunt you down.
[84:31.52]Do you know any of their weaknesses?
[84:33.84]The centaur shakes his mane.
[84:35.55]You mistake us.
[84:37.01]We patrol these plains, but we are not wizards.
[84:40.27]We do not know the ways of magic.
[84:44.15]But perhaps you have heard something.
[84:45.91]Somebody must have said something somewhere.
[84:48.66]The horseman looks at you with cold and stony eyes.
[84:51.96]Nothing.
[84:53.14]You are on your own.
[84:55.12]The furthest centaur kicks the ground and grumbles, clearly unhappy that they are talking to you.
[85:02.11]Where can I find them?
[85:05.31]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[85:07.23]I need to find them all.
[85:09.31]That might yet be possible.
[85:11.35]The backlands are a strange place.
[85:13.52]They shift and change.
[85:15.06]The very Earth itself is cursed.
[85:17.30]Many who try to rush across find themselves only turning in circles.
[85:21.50]The serpents have crossed once before, I've seen.
[85:24.52]But they may be slow in returning.
[85:27.06]The centaurs are looking increasingly restless.
[85:29.52]What are the serpents?
[85:30.76]What are they?
[85:31.08]What do they do?
[85:33.17]They are seven demons from one source.
[85:35.83]The legend says there was a hydra with many heads.
[85:39.29]The archmage chopped them away before enslaving them to his dark purposes.
[85:44.67]But the legend says that was a long time ago.
[85:47.23]And yet, it is you they have been waiting for and you alone.
[85:52.03]Enough of this!
[85:53.77]Why are we talking to this doomed creature?
[85:56.23]Let's rob him and powder his bones for glue.
[86:02.66]I mean you no harm.
[86:03.52]What, what?
[86:04.00]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[86:06.48]The leader grins and turns on the spot.
[86:08.55]Then I will trample you purely for sport.
[86:12.95]The centaur wheels around to attack while the others hold back, cheering and waving their bows.
[86:16.43]You have no choice but to fight.
[86:21.73]I thought I could get like some real fucking info out of this guy.
[86:25.51]Get full blasted.
[86:29.59]I don't even give a shit.
[86:30.53]Full blast again.
[86:31.75]You're dead.
[86:32.75]Oh, that was fucking real easy.
[86:36.69]Seriously.
[86:40.29]You take advantage of the centaur's aggravation to press forward.
[86:42.63]You thrust forward.
[86:43.52]The centaur gives a great cry and falls to the ground, a huge plumb of dust.
[86:47.96]Really?
[86:51.82]Do it again.
[86:52.54]Whoa, this guy has way more stamina.
[86:53.66]Hold on.
[87:03.80]Defend.
[87:05.42]Okay, we took the same damage.
[87:06.94]That's alright.
[87:08.68]Falling.
[87:09.36]You drop into a crouch as the centaur blows forward.
[87:11.39]You are ready for it, falling away at the impact.
[87:13.09]Let's go for 6.7.
[87:14.87]God damn it.
[87:17.85]He wheels swiftly, calling to his fellows.
[87:19.99]He's coming in hard.
[87:24.87]You fall back as the centaur bellows forward.
[87:26.33]You duck his blade when it comes, though it leaves you breathless.
[87:29.65]He'll boil you for glue.
[87:31.51]The last centaur goads his fellow.
[87:35.48]He's gonna defend right here.
[87:38.34]Defend.
[87:39.42]Yeah, okay.
[87:40.02]That's fine.
[87:40.82]Come at me, Fall Blast.
[87:41.64]I'll come at you, Fall Blast.
[87:42.58]You wanna go with Fall Blast?
[87:43.48]Fall Blast.
[87:44.62]I fucking hate this.
[87:46.70]He's racist.
[87:47.58]God damn it!
[88:04.18]Okay.
[88:05.47]Now it's full blast time.
[88:08.89]God damn.
[88:15.79]Hey, why is he so passive?
[88:19.63]You fall back, the centaur circles you, threatening but not attempting a strike, you filthy two-leg.
[88:23.47]Is he gonna fucking come at me?
[88:29.71]What the fuck?
[88:31.20]Will he do something?
[88:33.39]You stay low, he puts space between you.
[88:36.27]Is he gonna do that again?
[88:36.99]No way he does that again.
[88:48.76]How am I gonna kill this guy if he just keeps doing this?
[88:52.50]We're both just looking at each other.
[88:55.76]The centaur paces around you, threatening but not attempting a strike.
[88:59.38]You have the smell of city filth about you.
[89:05.97]Should I defend again?
[89:08.43]No.
[89:08.95]There's no way.
[89:10.23]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[89:14.80]He's defended like six times in a row.
[89:19.36]You fucking son of a god.
[89:21.44]I'm so mad right now.
[89:23.92]I'm dead.
[89:30.54]Just kill me.
[89:31.02]Fucking kill me.
[89:31.72]Kill me.
[89:32.38]Kill me.
[89:32.70]I don't even care.
[89:33.16]Start over.
[89:34.32]This is fucking stupid.
[89:35.34]Give me a break.
[89:38.09]Full blast.
[89:41.81]Guy def- Guy defucking does zero like six fucking times in a row.
[89:50.58]Give me a break.
[89:52.46]He's gonna do it all.
[89:53.10]Zero.
[89:54.82]Time for another fucking zero.
[89:56.76]You'll die here.
[89:58.12]Just kidding.
[89:58.72]Zero.
[90:01.80]He stamps away.
[90:02.82]He stamps away.
[90:04.10]Zero.
[90:06.80]Hey, you filthy two-legged.
[90:07.97]You're a piece of shit.
[90:08.77]I'm just gonna stand here.
[90:11.91]He puts space between you.
[90:13.89]I'm just not gonna do anything.
[90:16.63]You have the smell of city filth.
[90:18.01]Ah, zero.
[90:21.61]Oh, he dashes backwards.
[90:22.55]That's a zero.
[90:24.99]When am I supposed to go in?
[90:27.13]This... He's...
[90:51.80]I just, like, did a little poke on him.
[90:57.02]I knew what was going on.
[90:58.16]I'm just fucking around.
[91:00.74]Jeez, you guys are so impatient.
[91:03.02]You don't want to fuck with him?
[91:04.54]Let's fuck with him.
[91:05.16]Watch, now he's going to come full blast.
[91:07.91]I'm just playing around with him.
[91:12.41]He stamps away.
[91:13.49]Okay, here he goes again.
[91:16.65]Rabbit, yeah, alright, well, here you go.
[91:19.31]This is a .1 for you.
[91:25.41]Dammit.
[91:35.44]I wanna regain stamina here.
[91:38.08]He dashes backwards.
[91:40.00]Okay, I want a full bar.
[91:42.54]Dog!
[91:43.69]Well, take a point one.
[91:46.93]This is dumb.
[91:51.03]There we go, sit down.
[91:54.90]He wheels calling to his fellows.
[91:57.06]Boy, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[91:57.80]What are you gonna do?
[91:58.40]Nothing.
[92:02.40]Oh, wow.
[92:02.74]I thought he was gonna step back.
[92:06.08]Whatever, full blast him.
[92:06.94]He's dead.
[92:10.68]Alright, does that hit?
[92:15.28]This is like watching two puppies try and fight for dominance.
[92:19.10]Everybody's like yelling at me.
[92:21.21]I looked over at the chat, and it was like, oh, you fucking idiot.
[92:23.73]0.1, you fucking dumbass.
[92:29.78]I did it.
[92:30.22]I did it.
[92:30.52]It's okay.
[92:31.28]Don't worry.
[92:31.64]I'm okay.
[92:36.78]Hey, to be fair, that's the first time that's happened where a guy's done that.
[92:42.53]Competent combat.
[92:45.63]The last of the centaurs looks at you, eyes filled with fear.
[92:48.49]He circles around you, trying to steer clear of your sword.
[92:50.87]What?
[92:52.96]You fucking... Ah, you fucking dumbass.
[92:59.02]You fucking fringus.
[93:03.92]I'm gonna spare him.
[93:06.70]I'm gonna spare this guy.
[93:08.74]Keep your life, you declare.
[93:10.58]The creature nods quickly and then wheels around and races away.
[93:14.68]The planes fall silent.
[93:15.63]The two dead centaurs are bleeding quietly into the sand.
[93:19.09]The arrow fired by the centaur in the dirt is here as well.
[93:24.45]Can I like... I'm gonna take the arrow.
[93:26.83]You tug the arrow from the dirt.
[93:27.81]The shaft is thick as your finger.
[93:29.03]The metal tip the size of a whetstone.
[93:31.57]You slide it into your pack.
[93:33.58]And let's search the bodies.
[93:37.48]There is no use letting their corpses go to waste.
[93:40.04]The sands will cover them and their belongings all too quickly.
[93:43.56]Rifting through their saddlebags, you uncover four gold pieces, a pouch of brown sand, and a strange mass of green fur.
[93:53.16]What is it?
[93:54.32]You turn the fur over in your hands.
[93:55.57]It seems to be more from some kind of long-haired goat or cat and has been unevenly dyed.
[94:01.21]It is no doubt lice-infested.
[94:03.03]Yeah, I'll take it.
[94:06.60]You pull out the mass of fur to find it's a green wig.
[94:10.76]I got a green wig now.
[94:11.74]Nice.
[94:13.10]I can talk to animals now.
[94:15.26]You put it into your pack, then you leave the corpses for the dust and turn your back.
[94:18.51]You march on.
[94:23.74]Greenwig.
[94:25.84]I've come to join the zapping.
[94:28.12]Thanks a lot, Mig.
[94:28.76]Thanks, Princess.
[94:29.44]Awesome 85 for 11 months.
[94:31.32]Grandmaster Engineering.
[94:32.26]Paint Mang.
[94:33.55]Grandmaster Engineering again with a .1.
[94:36.61]Thank you, Squidward.
[94:38.95]Roggle Boggle Duxie.
[94:40.67]Murray's Bagels.
[94:42.23]Blue Kudu and the Royal Duck.
[94:44.79]They say, how about a D&D or similar RPG series with you, Ster, and others?
[94:47.88]A lot of good DMs out there.
[94:51.35]Actually, we're currently playing D&D right now.
[94:54.96]For fun.
[94:57.18]Just kind of doing it.
[94:58.80]It's a great time.
[95:00.54]I think you'll find we're stupid enough to travel here unguarded.
[95:06.19]Well, thank you Cryofix nonetheless.
[95:08.59]And Duang Tang, thanks for the resub.
[95:11.39]And Mooples, moo please.
[95:13.33]Thanks for the sub.
[95:15.87]Alright.
[95:17.09]So we got a green-headed wig.
[95:18.97]We can talk to animals.
[95:20.59]And I think we can talk all languages now, too.
[95:25.33]But we're good.
[95:26.68]We're good.
[95:29.34]Stream it, you dumpas.
[95:32.46]Alright.
[95:33.40]By the way, I just noticed something.
[95:34.70]What's the uptime?
[95:36.48]What do we got for an uptime so far?
[95:38.62]Like an hour and a half?
[95:40.34]And we're still here?
[95:43.04]Okay, I haven't really been able to pay attention to it.
[95:45.64]Has any frame... Anybody had any frame drops?
[95:48.64]I don't see that there are, but I just want to make sure.
[95:50.40]Because we're currently still going, and this is, like, pretty exciting to me.
[95:57.08]That I can actually stream for more than a fucking hour right now.
[96:02.74]Hour and a half.
[96:03.14]Okay, good.
[96:05.46]No, no.
[96:05.94]Okay.
[96:08.14]Jinxed.
[96:11.08]Alright, good.
[96:11.84]Good.
[96:12.74]Cool.
[96:15.56]Alright, you abandoned the road and cut across the bone gray plane.
[96:19.51]The air moves a little still icy, but fresh.
[96:22.13]A little distance back from the old road is there's a deep pit in the ground, presumably left over from the building of the tower, which appears to have been abandoned.
[96:29.94]A strange wailing noise comes from inside.
[96:35.86]Listen.
[96:37.90]You pause to listen to the sound.
[96:39.92]It is a musical sound, the playing of a pipe of some kind, but the tune is unlike anything you've ever heard before.
[96:46.48]It seems to coil around itself, and the player does not seem to pause for breath.
[96:56.93]From what I know about musical tunes, this could be like the jig spell, just blasting.
[97:01.55]Somebody has like their speakers hanging out the window, blasting the jig spell.
[97:07.44]I'm scared to go over here.
[97:11.50]Fuck it, let's go.
[97:14.56]I knew it.
[97:15.32]Look at this guy.
[97:18.43]You stride over to the pit and peer in over the edge.
[97:21.55]At the bottom squats a thin, dark-skinned man playing a pipe.
[97:26.25]And in front of him, half a dozen snakes are writhing and dancing in the air.
[97:33.29]He has not yet noticed you.
[97:44.43]Do you want me to counter-jig him?
[97:46.59]Oh, look, I see you making those snake dances.
[97:50.93]You want to dance yourself, friend?
[97:54.51]I think I'm going to do that.
[97:55.43]That sounds funny.
[97:57.03]I'm going to counter his jig with my own jig.
[98:05.14]What else can I do?
[98:06.78]Losing a treasure.
[98:09.54]Dumb.
[98:09.88]I can make him clumsy.
[98:12.95]No, I don't think we need any more looking around.
[98:15.19]I'm going to counter his jig with my own.
[98:17.56]Cause lively dancing.
[98:23.22]Reaching up to the constellations above you, create the spell, pulling out your bamboo flute and starting to play.
[98:28.86]The man in the pit looks up with surprise and some delight, but the spell does not seem to affect him.
[98:34.61]Another musician, he declares with pleasure.
[98:37.03]Perhaps I can play something that will amuse you.
[98:42.18]Yeah, you could try.
[98:43.86]The man nods and begins to play a strange tune.
[98:47.90]It is soft and peaceful and you find yourself becoming transfixed by his playing.
[98:52.61]Oh shit.
[98:55.75]No, I was wrong.
[98:56.37]This is the wrong spell.
[98:57.57]He's trying to fucking trance me.
[99:00.51]He's trying to trance me.
[99:01.85]He's trying to trance me.
[99:09.46]You spin the constellations into shape around you, winding a powerful electric force in your hand.
[99:13.49]But before you can threaten the trauma, the man's tune has made you dance, firing your hands into the air, causing the lightning to zap outwards in the sky.
[99:22.72]Lost three fucking stamina.
[99:24.28]Stop casting Zap.
[99:26.88]It hasn't worked in like two or three hours.
[99:35.13]My wife gave birth to my first son this morning.
[99:37.31]Well, congratulations, dude.
[99:39.39]We named him Zappa.
[99:42.99]I thought that was real.
[99:45.46]What's going on, diabetes?
[99:46.50]I'm doing good.
[99:53.04]Cover my ears.
[99:54.52]Quickly, before the music can take control of you, you cover up your ears with your hands.
[99:57.75]The man plays louder.
[100:00.30]God damn it.
[100:00.90]What do I do here?
[100:01.54]Cast?
[100:01.84]I can't do anything.
[100:03.34]You spread your arms to cast a spell, but you have uncovered your ears in the process.
[100:08.98]The snake charmer's tune takes a sudden hold of you.
[100:11.59]You curl up on the ground, and as you do so, the music changes to a series of shrill whistles.
[100:16.51]Suddenly, your skin is hot.
[100:18.83]Get up!
[100:20.41]Your eyelids fall heavy but suddenly strangely thin.
[100:23.91]You reach up to rub them but find you have no fingers, no hands, and your arms are pinned to your side.
[100:28.01]Scales are appearing on your flesh and a long forked tongue spits from your mouth.
[100:32.17]The snake charmer smiles.
[100:33.79]Welcome, my beauty.
[100:35.23]You make a fine addition to our family.
[100:38.22]You've been turned into a snake.
[100:42.54]Oh, well, that's too bad.
[100:44.52]I'm going to fucking murder this guy now.
[100:48.10]Like,
[100:50.29]This guy is fucking dead.
[100:53.21]I'm going to go drive my sword through this guy's face.
[100:57.62]Make a move.
[101:00.32]Let's go.
[101:01.38]I'm going to fucking slaughter this guy.
[101:09.69]Leap into the fucking pit.
[101:13.25]Seizing the element of surprise, you jump down into the pit, shouting loudly to frighten the snake charmer.
[101:17.87]But he does not jump.
[101:19.11]Instead, he only begins to play faster.
[101:20.91]Fucking stab him!
[101:22.95]You whip your broadsword from its sheath as the first serpent darts to... Fuck!
[101:28.59]Cut him down.
[101:32.40]Snake dies.
[101:33.02]Here comes the next snake.
[101:34.04]Yeah, full blast.
[101:36.50]Cut through his fucking whole bunch of snakes.
[101:41.32]Come on!
[101:43.06]Oh, cut all your fucking snake heads to the ground.
[101:46.04]Another serpent, yeah, another serpent dead.
[101:52.92]Oh, fuck, he bit me.
[101:54.73]Oh, shit, he bit me hard.
[101:58.29]Fuck him.
[101:58.79]No, no, no.
[102:00.07]Two.
[102:01.63]Two.
[102:01.85]Alright, that's it.
[102:07.66]There's one more snake.
[102:13.04]All the snakes are dead.
[102:15.24]There he is.
[102:15.82]There he is.
[102:16.30]Okay, shit.
[102:17.34]Alright.
[102:18.36]The last of the snakes fall.
[102:19.33]The snake charmer curses you and attacks with clawed fingernails.
[102:23.97]Oh, what's... The snake charmer comes out, you tongue flickering as he scratches out.
[102:29.19]You swing your sword for a brutal attack and knock him to the dirt.
[102:31.79]He is bleeding hard into the dirt.
[102:33.83]A few serpents lick at the blood.
[102:35.84]Do it again.
[102:38.38]Oh, what's that?
[102:39.14]Sorry, sir.
[102:41.26]You keep up the pressure.
[102:42.24]You lash out with your blade.
[102:43.42]Tiny snake heads fall to the dirt.
[102:45.50]Finally, a strike lands home and deep.
[102:48.02]The snake charmer's hands rush to press the wound and he curls up dramatically, howling and hissing until he lies on the floor in a foetal ball, spitting to himself as he dies.
[103:01.39]Get fucking... Get fucking destroyed.
[103:05.86]You wipe the sweat from your brow and he searches body.
[103:11.55]Working quickly, you search the body of the snake charmer, uncovering a bottle of clear liquid.
[103:17.62]However, his pipe has been shattered in the struggle.
[103:23.96]Let's look at it.
[103:29.06]You shake the bottle.
[103:29.96]Whatever is inside looks like water, but it seems to sparkle with an incredible purity.
[103:34.26]You recognize the shine of the liquid.
[103:35.52]It's very heat.
[103:36.04]This is a vial of holy water.
[103:39.48]I'm taking it.
[103:43.71]I'm taking it.
[103:49.11]Did we just gain like a thousand fucking viewers?
[103:53.41]What happened here?
[103:56.87]Well, however there was just a shitload of people that just came.
[104:00.05]Hi.
[104:00.87]Welcome.
[104:02.47]A lot of people just showed up.
[104:05.09]I'm not sure if I got hosted by somebody or if something happened there, but thank you nonetheless.
[104:08.35]Welcome, guys.
[104:10.35]Wish I could take some snake oil.
[104:14.81]You take the vial of clear water, then you have your fill.
[104:17.25]You've had your fill.
[104:18.53]You want to spend no more time in this bloody pit.
[104:22.09]Scramble back up to the surface.
[104:24.57]Oh, star stream just ended.
[104:25.61]Okay, cool.
[104:26.17]Well, hello, star viewers.
[104:28.63]Hello, star.
[104:31.49]jermaMoon.
[104:32.61]Thanks a lot, Dewey, for the sub.
[104:35.61]Well, vial of holy water.
[104:37.27]That's creepy.
[104:37.77]Listen to the snakes.
[104:38.46]I didn't really...
[104:46.50]So wait, I was here already, right?
[104:49.44]Yeah, I think so.
[104:52.15]How am I going to get across that bridge?
[104:56.75]You carry on tramping across the endless waste.
[104:58.77]The sun is hot now.
[105:00.53]Scoured into the plain here are deep, curving ruts.
[105:04.90]From a cart, perhaps?
[105:07.32]Most likely not.
[105:08.36]They curve backwards and forwards, so unless the driver was blind drunk or led by a maddened horse, such tracks would be impossible.
[105:15.46]What?! !
[105:16.35]Most likely they are the tracks of a snake, but the size is hard to comprehend.
[105:20.03]Each groove in the land is large enough to stand in up to the height of your hip.
[105:25.66]Follow the tracks.
[105:27.62]You follow the curving tracks backwards and forwards across the plain.
[105:30.60]They turn a little way southwards, but continue on towards the mountains.
[105:36.72]Fuck.
[105:37.68]I gotta move this thing out of the way, don't I?
[105:38.94]Because this is like currently...
[105:42.57]Because I'm currently going to go back.
[105:43.53]I'm going to go into the past.
[105:44.85]Because that was in... Oh, jeez.
[105:48.31]The tracks give out as the ground underfoot turns from dust to broken rock.
[105:51.82]Shit.
[105:52.90]The foot of the eastern ridge.
[105:58.78]Well, there's definitely a serpent over here.
[106:00.06]Okay, I'm going to rest.
[106:04.81]Feel a great peace.
[106:05.65]The sun is sinking.
[106:06.29]It'll be night soon.
[106:06.93]The time has come to move.
[106:10.03]Well, I'm going to go move this out of the way.
[106:16.36]Because if there's a serpent here, I'm going to fight it right now.
[106:21.60]Wait, what?
[106:22.86]You pick your way carefully over the rocks to the edge of an old road.
[106:25.54]Night falls.
[106:26.46]You should try to find somewhere safe to sleep, especially after going all day without eating.
[106:30.13]Suddenly, the ground beneath you rumbles and begins to slide into itself.
[106:33.29]There is no time for a spell.
[106:34.43]Your arms are wide, trying to maintain your balance.
[106:38.25]Jump.
[106:39.74]You try to jump clear, but can gain no decent purchase on the shifting sand.
[106:44.48]Meanwhile, the ground is moving away faster and faster from under your feet.
[106:47.52]You fall backwards, spreading out your legs to reduce their pressure on the sands.
[106:51.47]Then you scramble back as fast as possible, trying to escape the growing pit.
[106:57.61]What the fuck?
[106:59.91]Ground is just fucking exploding right now.
[107:08.11]Zip.
[107:08.47]Cause teleportation.
[107:09.35]Don't have a green ring.
[107:11.37]Shit.
[107:11.63]No time to zap.
[107:15.17]Yob.
[107:15.73]Summon a giant.
[107:16.65]Fuck.
[107:16.91]I don't have a... What would a giant do?
[107:19.19]Just pick me up and carry me?
[107:25.74]Walk.
[107:26.12]Create a shield.
[107:26.80]I don't need that right now.
[107:28.78]Thanks a lot, Flame.
[107:29.44]Infinite Flame.
[107:32.12]Thanks, Zombie Man.
[107:34.20]I third... I thirdie Manny for 11 months.
[107:38.67]And then Primrose the Great for nine months.
[107:42.75]Welcome, dudes.
[107:43.27]And then Dewey94, DanVegas27, and the Diabeetles.
[107:46.72]Welcome, guys, again.
[107:48.20]Thank you for the resubs.
[107:50.72]Wall.
[107:51.38]Create an invisible wall.
[107:54.64]That might actually be good.
[107:58.34]Fall.
[107:59.08]Float in air.
[107:59.86]Okay, no, we're floating.
[108:02.73]There's no time to waste.
[108:03.63]You cast the spell, lightening your body weight to a mere fraction of normal.
[108:06.89]Should you fall, you'll be safe, but the spell won't last long.
[108:10.52]But though you are now floating above the ground, the ground is still moving downwards, and so are you.
[108:15.90]As the ground slips further away, forming a pit in the ground, you slide helplessly in to where something is waiting.
[108:23.94]Fuck.
[108:27.33]This has got to be a serpent.
[108:38.16]Scramble.
[108:40.88]You scramble back just as something launches through the sand to come for you.
[108:44.12]It's a badu beetle.
[108:46.68]Oh shit, that's not a serpent.
[108:49.02]Okay, now I can fucking zap him.
[108:59.90]Is this gonna work?
[109:03.89]I don't think this creature, this giant sand beetle, is going to start dancing.
[109:09.51]I don't think that's going to work.
[109:13.19]We have no zap access, but we do have a bomb.
[109:20.17]It's either throw a... I just got fucking tea in my eye.
[109:28.78]Ow.
[109:34.26]Okay.
[109:39.10]I could put a wall up.
[109:41.86]Tea.
[109:45.66]I think this is a good opportunity to throw a grenade.
[109:47.29]Alright, I'm gonna do a poll.
[109:51.53]We're either throwing a grenade or we're doing jig.
[109:55.23]It's not gonna work.
[109:56.23]It's a fucking beetle.
[110:00.61]Beetles don't even understand the comprehension of the word dance.
[110:12.17]Jig, pop, or draw sword.
[110:16.27]I already know what's going to win.
[110:21.77]Do I even need to do a poll?
[110:22.97]Do I need to do a poll for this one?
[110:30.17]87% of the vote right now.
[110:32.69]Oh, no, no, no.
[110:33.25]Wait a minute.
[110:33.55]Wait a minute.
[110:33.93]Wait a minute.
[110:40.30]Jig.
[110:40.88]Jig on a beetle.
[110:45.13]I'm gonna cast jig and he's going to stick his pincers down my throat They got legs they can dance Alright, this is this is 10 seconds before we close this one
[111:08.68]Because the jig is winning by extreme.
[111:11.52]Draw sword isn't popular.
[111:13.46]20 people.
[111:14.68]21 people voted for the sword.
[111:17.42]For all those guys, those like 23 people right now that voted for sword, you guys are true warriors.
[111:26.09]10 seconds.
[111:26.73]That's it.
[111:28.96]Five, four, three, two, one.
[111:33.46]With 65% of the vote, we are casting Jig.
[111:35.94]What's up, Omega?
[111:38.78]Thanks for the sub.
[111:40.59]J-I-G.
[111:43.13]Cause lively dancing.
[111:47.33]You pull up your pipe and begin to play.
[111:49.11]The beetle freezes in its advance from the pit, then rears up onto its back legs and begins to wave its front legs in the air in a rhythmic cycling motion.
[112:01.41]The sand underneath the beetle begins to slide back down into the pit.
[112:06.36]Oh, shit.
[112:07.92]Play faster.
[112:09.52]You begin to play furiously fast, and the beetle starts dancing wildly with crazy vigor.
[112:14.66]Sand spews up from either side of it, and a moment later, it has dug itself down into the Earth, and the ground seals up overhead.
[112:22.07]Time to be moving on.
[112:25.23]It pushes like hands in the air, like left and right.
[112:29.82]How is that supposed to work?
[112:32.15]How would that work?
[112:35.11]That's not even possible.
[112:40.22]And we didn't use any stim.
[112:41.44]I actually can't believe that worked.
[112:48.10]Well, good call, chat.
[112:50.42]Good call.
[112:54.08]Alright.
[112:55.36]Yeah, we've done this before.
[112:56.30]I want to move this out of the way.
[112:58.91]so I can fight.
[113:00.07]I think I have to sleep, actually, first.
[113:04.51]Chad is smarter than you know.
[113:06.29]That is true.
[113:07.19]They are very intelligent.
[113:09.35]They have very genius things to say or do in certain situations.
[113:14.26]Alright, we're going to sleep here.
[113:15.34]It's safe.
[113:16.94]You've not eaten today, but you have no rations.
[113:18.62]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[113:19.30]I'm inside of a tower.
[113:20.16]I should be fine.
[113:21.84]You lie back and try to forget your troubles.
[113:23.32]You feel untouched by danger here, and your slumber is unbroken by dreams.
[113:29.26]Day 8.
[113:30.43]You become weak, gain some gold, found no new clues, and figured out that you can make giant beetles dance.
[113:37.09]Pretty cool.
[113:39.85]Do I show fan art on stream?
[113:41.37]Because I have fan art of you almost done.
[113:43.10]It's fine if you don't prefer it.
[113:44.22]I just need to know.
[113:47.12]Not really on stream.
[113:48.76]Not necessarily.
[113:50.88]Enjoy the bit train round 2.
[113:55.08]I don't know about that.
[113:57.74]But thank you, Jorah, for the 100 bits.
[113:59.08]And thank you, Dragon Breath.
[114:01.42]I would tweet it at me.
[114:02.31]Usually I'll like it or I'll retweet sometimes.
[114:07.29]It's easier to show it to me on Twitter.
[114:09.57]Just because I check Twitter all the time.
[114:15.33]Alright.
[114:16.55]Time to move.
[114:16.93]You could go back.
[114:17.41]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[114:18.29]I want to move this so I can go see if I can fight the serpent.
[114:24.44]PogChamp, PogChamp, PogChamp.
[114:27.93]Adjust the beam.
[114:30.21]This is not the beam I want to do.
[114:31.59]I want to teleport to the other one.
[114:36.49]Okay, this one.
[114:38.64]Yeah, because I'm going to move this one like that way.
[114:40.34]So do you see what I was talking about here, guys?
[114:45.28]When part one, sorcery one, took like three hours to beat.
[114:51.50]We haven't even gone over here.
[114:53.40]There's so much left to do, and this is past and present, all these maps.
[114:58.74]There's so much in this part.
[115:02.44]We're, like, still, like, in this quadrant.
[115:05.74]And it's been, what, like, four or five hours in part three so far?
[115:11.70]So it's a very long, very fun, very drawn-out experience.
[115:16.62]And if for some reason we don't finish it, then on your own, I would say, for sure, this is, like, a game that you would like to play.
[115:24.36]You should get it.
[115:26.86]I have no affiliation with this company at all.
[115:29.32]This is just a game I like.
[115:32.31]Every part seems to get longer and longer.
[115:37.15]So let's move this beam.
[115:41.11]Adjust the beam.
[115:45.89]So this was here.
[115:46.55]I'm going to move it just over here somewhere.
[115:53.37]Let's move it like there.
[115:56.48]Did I do this?
[115:57.06]Yeah, I did this already.
[115:58.46]I went back there.
[115:59.02]I'm just going to stick it there.
[116:02.28]Then I'm going to go back and see if I can trace those steps.
[116:10.05]Sellout streamer.
[116:12.89]Alright, so it was up here where I saw the tracks.
[116:17.63]So, let's make a move.
[116:23.39]Lower level.
[116:33.03]does the beam do uh hold on you must okay I'm gonna that took a whole day yeah that took like a whole day to do that uh so the beat so there's two there's I'm going between past and present so this is currently the present and the green is the past uh from my understanding
[116:59.40]So everything, you're pretty much playing through two separate maps that you have to go between to figure out the puzzle, the clues.
[117:08.12]And all the serpents and all the snakes, they all need to... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[117:12.12]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[117:13.72]Hold on.
[117:15.48]Hold on.
[117:15.90]Okay, good.
[117:16.22]We're fine.
[117:16.86]I didn't want to do that.
[117:17.70]I wanted to go this way.
[117:21.94]Okay.
[117:22.80]This is new material.
[117:24.85]You walk for half an hour across the endless plain.
[117:26.87]The sun begins to dip, heading towards the horizon.
[117:29.55]A few hundred yards ahead of you is a camp of covered wagons and carts arranged in a circle.
[117:34.75]At its center, a fire burns and you can see figures moving around the camp.
[117:40.10]What's he gonna do?
[117:41.50]Is he gonna go into the camp?
[117:43.22]Is he gonna try to find stuff in this camp?
[117:46.40]Who knows?
[117:47.94]You'll soon find out after he takes a fucking piss and comes back in like two minutes.
[117:55.55]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[117:56.89]Using the bathroom.
[117:58.63]BRB.
[120:17.54]Wait, what?
[120:36.73]Okay.
[120:38.65]Rip strip.
[120:39.67]No, no, no, no.
[120:41.93]Stream is not dying.
[120:46.96]No, it's not.
[120:48.00]Don't scare me like that.
[120:49.37]Don't scare me like that.
[120:53.47]Oh, God.
[120:57.23]Don't even joke about that.
[120:59.55]It's going to give me a heart attack.
[121:07.02]No, it's still going.
[121:07.86]Okay, we're good.
[121:09.66]You guys got me.
[121:10.72]Wow.
[121:12.57]Got me.
[121:15.50]get baited okay so there's a camp up here we're definitely going every camp you gotta go into every camp why not right you walk towards the caravans but stop suddenly when an arrow flies through the air and buries itself in the dust to adjust to your left another man's lit goes they're shooting arrows at me hold up my hands you raise your hands to signal you're not a threat there is no response dare you step closer
[121:45.88]Oh, fuck.

[122:14.56]But thank you, nonetheless.
[122:16.98]Thank you, Chora the Explora.

[122:39.30]Look at the badge he has.
[122:40.61]Waffen, just say anything in the chat.
[122:43.96]You have like the super human badge at this point.
[122:47.96]It's been like three days.
[122:54.37]Hundred fucking bucks.
[122:59.31]Honestly, I didn't think I'd ever see somebody with that badge.
[123:02.87]At least in this channel.
[123:05.01]I never expected like, oh yeah, you know, I'm going to stream for like a week.
[123:08.06]Somebody already has the $1,000 badge.
[123:11.73]Like, holy shit, dude.
[123:12.77]That's fucking crazy.
[123:14.85]I love you.
[123:15.45]Well, thanks, man.
[123:18.11]That's all I can say to you.
[123:19.55]That's fucking extremely generous of you.
[123:24.23]So that's all I know.
[123:25.90]That's all I can say.
[123:28.52]But you have the badge now.
[123:33.04]And thank you, Pita07.
[123:35.28]Thank you for the sub.
[123:39.08]Please pay my rent.
[123:43.69]You've paid my electric bill.
[123:46.23]You've paid my gas bill.
[123:48.71]You've paid for my student loans.
[123:54.02]Much love.
[123:56.44]Speech.
[124:03.21]Speech, speech, speech, speech.
[124:13.94]Alright, let's keep going.
[124:15.62]Yeah, welcome, dude.
[124:16.94]And thanks again.
[124:19.40]You know, you know, I have the badge.
[124:22.60]You can show it to anybody.
[124:25.89]Alright, let's do it.
[124:26.85]So people are shooting arrows at me and my hands are in the air.
[124:31.33]I'm going to call up my hands in the air.
[124:33.85]Greetings.
[124:34.95]There is no response, but at least there is not another arrow.
[124:39.63]I need directions.
[124:41.17]I need some directions.
[124:43.45]Nothing.
[124:45.15]Approach the camp.
[124:47.66]Okay.
[124:49.68]Who's shooting arrows at me?
[124:53.90]No more arrows are fired, although as you get closer, you begin to see the bowmen, shafts ready, covering you.
[125:01.36]A crowd is gathering to see who you are.
[125:02.88]So there's guys on the side, just holding their bows, drawn, facing me.
[125:09.24]Look at the crowd.
[125:10.77]It is a caravan of black elves.
[125:12.75]Presumably, they are traitors of some kind, as they are far from home, out here in the wastes.
[125:19.99]Didn't I have a run-in with some black elves a long time ago?
[125:24.81]Aren't these the guys that made me entertain them?
[125:28.22]And I tried to kill them all, and that was, like, very entertaining to them?
[125:32.80]What's going on, Idgolf?
[125:34.02]Welcome back for five months.
[125:37.24]The elves eye you suspiciously as you stride into their midst.
[125:43.43]An elder elf, stouter and better dressed than the others, steps forward to confront you.
[125:49.14]Hit him.
[125:51.06]Oh, like, let's get out of the way.
[125:52.48]The elder is coming.
[125:54.00]Oh, hello, my ch- And he's just dead.
[126:00.30]Oh, yes.
[126:00.98]Thank you for coming to- Zap him.
[126:15.37]Let him speak.
[126:20.13]Okay, you guys are gonna have to decide.
[126:23.73]What are the spells we can cast?
[126:26.41]Knock his teeth up.
[126:30.17]Okay, there is law, which is try to control their minds.
[126:35.34]I don't know how non-intelligent they are, though.
[126:37.04]Aren't elves smart?
[126:40.12]There's dud, which is treasure.
[126:42.06]I can just put, like, a treasure chest' chest and gold all over the place.
[126:46.13]Can't read his mind.
[126:48.75]Uh, there's... Gog, Illusion of Worship.
[126:52.99]I don't have a thing for that.
[126:54.23]There's... Gak?
[126:56.47]A fak?
[126:58.13]Is that a G?
[126:58.69]A Gak?
[126:59.55]Cause fear.
[127:00.59]I don't have the mask.
[127:05.11]Or there is... What's the R?
[127:08.05]Is it rock?
[127:10.13]Rap.
[127:11.02]Talk all languages.
[127:17.05]What, do I not speak their language?
[127:18.19]Why wouldn't I be able to?
[127:22.49]Just hit him.
[127:24.27]This is like too much.
[127:25.21]Let's just punch him in the face.
[127:26.25]Alright, the only thing... None of these are really... I don't think any of these are worth doing.
[127:38.48]Rap battle?
[127:40.84]Do a freestyle on him?
[127:47.93]Raph.
[127:49.69]I kind of want to punch him in the face.
[127:52.31]I'm surrounded.
[127:53.41]There are people with bows like... aiming at me right now.
[127:58.64]If I punch the leader in the face, I'm going to instantly die.
[128:06.02]Alright, we're doing a pull.
[128:11.68]I'm either going to let him speak, punch him in the face, or we're going to do a rap-rap.
[128:15.17]We're going to do a-rap.
[128:16.53]And talk all languages.
[128:20.41]Hmm.
[128:23.20]Punch him.
[128:23.76]Zap, zap, zap, zap.
[128:26.70]Alright.
[128:29.56]Let him talk.
[128:32.70]Insta-punch.
[128:35.04]Or... Rap.
[128:41.87]Alright.
[128:43.09]Let's see what happens.
[128:45.49]Oh, that's not gonna work, I don't think.
[128:46.73]Yeah, sorry about that.
[128:47.67]Here's the real link.
[128:55.51]Break his friggin' nose.
[128:56.87]Thanks a lot, Mink.
[129:02.61]Thanks a lot, Killer, for the 100.
[129:05.55]Thanks a lot, Mihange.
[129:07.42]ItGoff, for the resub.
[129:09.48]Didn't... Wait, ItGoff, didn't you resub before?
[129:14.46]Wow.
[129:15.18]Surprisingly, Rap is very close with Instapunch.
[129:22.58]Let cooler heads prevail.
[129:27.55]I think Raph is gonna win.
[129:28.71]I believe Talk All Languages is going to win.
[129:37.15]Wait a minute.
[129:38.41]Wait a minute.
[129:39.85]Not so fast.
[129:42.21]Not so fast.
[129:43.07]38 to 43?
[129:45.67]Alright, 10 seconds.
[129:46.17]Coward chat.
[129:59.83]Beware not left.
[130:02.84]Pray to the dolphin.
[130:03.54]I could pray to the dolphin right now.
[130:05.86]I don't know.
[130:06.14]I feel like it's a waste.
[130:10.50]I found elf bones in the present in the dust.
[130:12.96]That's true.
[130:15.42]Alright.
[130:16.28]Looks like wrap it is.
[130:17.38]R.A.P.
[130:19.41]Yap him then wrap him.
[130:22.26]You know what they're saying.
[130:23.12]Why would you need to learn more languages?
[130:27.30]Hey, I didn't decide.
[130:31.02]Chat decided.
[130:32.40]I saw rap a hundred times in the chat.
[130:35.28]Poll is closed.
[130:36.69]We're going to rap.
[130:38.43]We're going to be able to speak all languages and then just speak like English to each other.
[130:42.73]R. A. P. Talk all languages.
[130:53.03]Grabbing the wig from your pack, you pull it onto your head and weave the spell.
[130:56.83]The elves watch with curiosity as you complete the spell and then greet the leader in the common tongue.
[131:05.32]Please!
[131:06.38]The black elf leader replies, You do not need to dress ceremonially to meet us.
[131:11.84]He indicates the wig.
[131:13.01]There is no need.
[131:14.89]The elves talk the common tongue.
[131:16.31]Your spell has been wasted.
[131:17.51]Oh, you don't need to dress up for us?
[131:21.67]Okay.
[131:23.55]You remove the wig from your head.
[131:24.87]The elf leader continues, If you seek shelter or food, then you will give it to me?
[131:35.55]Then you'll offer it?
[131:38.33]Then you'll waste your time.
[131:40.03]The elder finishes.
[131:41.51]Looking around the crowd, you see that most of the elves are thin and haggard looking.
[131:46.54]Perhaps some gold would change your mind.
[131:48.10]I'm here to trade with your help.
[131:53.55]I need your help.
[131:55.38]The Elder's face is an impassive mask.
[131:58.10]Black elves are cruel, heartless creatures.
[132:00.75]Help?
[132:01.71]He replies, almost spitting the word back at you.
[132:04.27]Help with what?
[132:08.22]I'm lost.
[132:09.88]I must find the seven serpents.
[132:13.20]What?
[132:14.56]So, you are the reason the serpents have come into the backlands and spread their terror.
[132:20.73]He is thinking hard, his eyes narrowing to slits.
[132:24.01]A moment later, he sees to have decided something.
[132:27.03]Come with me, stranger.
[132:28.89]I think we might have something you would be interested in.
[132:42.30]Oh, safe passage.
[132:48.24]God?
[132:48.68]Yeah, I can't do God.
[132:52.90]Punch.
[132:54.72]P-U-N.
[132:56.06]Punch.
[132:58.46]Nap.
[132:58.94]Cause sleepiness.
[133:04.26]Protect from magic.
[133:05.04]You know, it might not be a bad idea to protect from magic.
[133:07.42]Just protect from magic.
[133:10.32]Just to make sure.
[133:12.68]Reaching up to the constellations above you, create the spell and a veil of magical protection simmers into place around you.
[133:18.66]I'm safe.
[133:20.96]Follow him.
[133:23.00]Go ahead, do something fucked up to me.
[133:24.24]It'll bounce right back, idiot.
[133:27.30]This guy's a dummy.
[133:28.26]It's gonna bounce right back and it's gonna, like, hit him right in the face.
[133:31.84]He heads into the caravan and you follow.
[133:33.28]Let's go.
[133:39.63]Should have just hit him, shaking my head.
[133:42.33]You step up into the caravan of the black elf elder.
[133:44.73]He gestures for you to sit down.
[133:48.60]I'll sit.
[133:49.94]You accept his offer and sit down.
[133:52.48]Now, you are interested in the seven serpents.
[133:56.14]We encountered one recently, the moon serpent, but we frightened him away.
[134:00.80]I already know how to fucking fight the moon serpent.
[134:06.06]You must tell me.
[134:06.64]I already know.
[134:07.92]The elder glances over your shoulder.
[134:10.14]It was afraid of our fire.
[134:12.34]We lit torches and beat it back.
[134:14.30]He makes a flicking gesture to someone behind you.
[134:17.45]Look around.
[134:18.67]The elder is definitely gesturing to someone behind you.
[134:21.71]You turn in time to see the five strong black elves who rush in and grab your arms.
[134:27.29]From your position in the chair, you are all but helpless.
[134:31.08]Fuck.
[134:31.80]You move to cast a spell, but the elves have your arms firmly pinned.
[134:34.54]And without both hands free, you cannot craft magic.
[134:37.48]Yes.
[134:40.10]Let's arrange for this ragged man to meet the seven serpents.
[134:44.25]I'm sure the archmage will be most grateful.
[134:46.93]He gestures to the elves.
[134:48.83]You know what to do.
[134:52.45]What?
[134:55.25]You are dragged across the dust to the back of the caravan.
[134:58.76]The guards set to work making a tall wooden X from two long planks of wood.
[135:05.72]Please, do not mistake us for servants of the Archmage, the elf leader says as you are thrown down on one of the frames.
[135:12.94]We are not, but we would be his friends.
[135:20.67]He's evil.
[135:21.69]He's evil.
[135:23.37]He's fucking evil.
[135:25.46]The leader shakes his head.
[135:27.48]You come into our camp endangering us all?
[135:30.60]What if the serpents had found you here?
[135:32.70]Do you think they would have spared us?
[135:34.76]I think it is you who is the cruel one.
[135:37.75]The elf leader jerks a thumb.
[135:39.77]Hoist him up, my elves.
[135:41.33]There's a ration of beer for all of you.
[135:43.75]For a brief moment, a brief instant, the eager elves release your arms.
[135:49.00]Burn this fucking city to the ground.
[135:53.45]Oh, what's that?
[135:54.91]Excuse me.
[135:55.91]Excuse me for a second.
[135:57.11]What's the... Oh, can't do zap.
[136:00.45]You let go of me for one fucking second?
[136:02.47]Big mistake.
[136:03.99]I'm gonna cause a fucking bomb.
[136:05.73]Where's my bombs?
[136:09.70]Yes.
[136:10.24]Cause invisibility.
[136:13.12]I can go invisible?
[136:15.04]What else do I got?
[136:20.66]Man, hover in the air.
[136:22.22]I can go invisible.
[136:23.08]That ring has saved me so many fucking times.
[136:27.54]Cause fear.
[136:29.70]Rap.
[136:31.38]Talk all languages.
[136:33.64]I just put the wig back on.
[136:35.10]I'm just like, hey, hey guys.
[136:38.18]Zip.
[136:38.56]Yeah, it's put the ring on.
[136:41.96]No hostile spells.
[136:43.06]Damn, yeah, I know.
[136:43.89]That's bullshit.
[136:45.97]Well, uh... Invisibility, man.
[136:50.07]This ring has seriously saved my life.
[136:53.94]Invisibility.
[136:57.40]You put on the pearl ring and weave the enchantment.
[136:59.60]Gradually, a thin glow exudes from the jewel of the ring and it covers you.
[137:03.56]A moment later, the elves are tumbling over each other, trying to figure out where you have gone.
[137:09.44]I don't know, man.
[137:10.04]I feel like I... There's a lot of people roping around.
[137:19.30]Should I slip away?
[137:19.84]I'm going to run into somebody.
[137:20.98]Should I stay still?
[137:25.30]Or should I try to get away?
[137:26.49]I'm going to run into somebody and they're going to grab me.
[137:30.71]Slip away.
[137:32.25]You have a few moments in which to escape and you take them.
[137:35.77]Free.
[137:39.94]You slip quietly away from the camp.
[137:41.64]The dewy light from your pearl ring fades and disappears.
[137:44.28]Your veil of magical protection shimmers out of existence.
[137:49.77]Look at that.
[137:50.67]Dude, that magical fucking ring.
[137:56.08]If you stay, it'll wear off and they'll find you.
[137:58.40]That's true.
[137:59.86]But I didn't know if I was gonna, like, you know, like, bump into somebody and they just fucking reach out and grab and I'm done.
[138:05.96]Should've punched him.
[138:07.77]Should've punched him right in his face.
[138:10.27]But, you know.
[138:12.97]Can't win them all, I guess.
[138:16.50]Thank you, Snoss Rifle.
[138:18.30]Could have busted his lip there.
[138:20.14]Thank you, KindXX for the subscription.
[138:22.55]Thank you, Minkfur for the 1,000 bits.
[138:25.93]That was earlier when you said break his nose, but thank you, by the way, for 10 bucks.
[138:30.63]Let's keep moving.
[138:31.35]I need to... Thanks, Thunder Vomit.
[138:34.51]Welcome.
[138:35.91]I want to follow the clues.
[138:39.71]Look at the broken Earth.
[138:40.89]Darkness clue.
[138:41.67]I need to rest.
[138:42.87]I don't want to rest here, I don't think.
[138:45.58]Rewind to punch.
[138:46.48]No rewinds.
[138:48.48]No rewinds.
[138:52.04]No decision is permanent, but these are.
[138:55.35]Rewind just to punch him?
[138:57.45]You guys want me to rewind and punch him in the face and then just come back to where I am?
[139:01.71]I won't be able to.
[139:04.11]If I rewind and punch him, I have to go... Like, the timeline turns into the single timeline.
[139:09.68]Like, here, I'll show you.
[139:12.36]If I rewind back to here...
[139:15.95]This becomes the sole timeline.
[139:17.75]I can't get back to... This is going to change completely.
[139:22.50]I can't do that.
[139:23.84]No rewinds.
[139:27.74]Hey, do you want to punch him in the face when you get there?
[139:30.38]By all means, go ahead.
[139:32.69]But I got... I slipped out.
[139:33.77]I got the fucking Quasimodo ring.
[139:37.17]I put it on and nobody can see me anymore.
[139:41.99]Fucking Quasi-Frodo.
[139:43.19]Frodo from Lord of the Rings.
[139:44.86]Whatever his name is.
[139:48.18]Alright.
[139:50.02]Pull.
[139:50.50]No, there's no rewinds.
[139:53.34]Darkness closes in.
[139:54.24]You need to rest.
[139:56.34]The ground here is broken dry mud.
[139:57.72]Deep cracks and uneven surfaces make it a slow going to walk across.
[140:05.19]If you give chat the option, it's gonna take it.
[140:07.25]Yeah, I know, right?
[140:13.31]Fine, I'll sleep here.
[140:14.13]I'm gonna wake up with like a fucking demon in front of my face.
[140:19.44]Quasi Frodo, sort of like Frodo.
[140:27.43]It is not the most comfortable place to rest, but it will suffice.
[140:29.84]You have eaten nothing today, but there is still something you can do to abate your hunger.
[140:32.86]I haven't eaten food in fucking like a week and a half.
[140:37.29]You stretch out and rest.
[140:38.69]What is left of the night is kept busy with vivid dreams.
[140:42.31]A hunched cripple stands over you, holding your broadsword in his hand.
[140:46.72]Just your leg, he says.
[140:48.50]I'll take your leg.
[140:50.06]But once or twice, I can't remember.
[140:53.50]Oh, fuck.
[140:54.64]Is he taking my leg now in my sleep?
[140:56.86]You hang limp from a cross of wood thousands of feet up in the air.
[141:00.48]A flock of crows are slowly rising, intent on taking your eyes.
[141:04.27]And all the while, you hear a distant laughter from the east.
[141:08.60]Please don't wake up with a fucking missing leg.
[141:19.02]You get to your feet.
[141:19.70]Okay, thank God.
[141:21.02]You get to your feet and brush the dry dust away.
[141:22.80]He didn't take it yet.
[141:24.44]I still have my leg.
[141:26.96]I still have my fucking leg.
[141:29.64]Run.
[141:31.54]The deep fissures and layers of the mud catch your eye.
[141:33.84]It is as though the whole plane had been held high in the air and dropped.
[141:38.57]It must have been very fertile land once.
[141:40.71]In a few cracks, thick clumps of grass still managed to grow.
[141:43.70]You swing your foot through one, and it hits something quite solid.
[141:49.58]Look closer.
[141:50.88]Squatting down on your heels, you look more closely.
[141:53.04]Inside a particularly thick clump of grass, you spy something dry, gray, and round.
[142:01.64]Lever it with my sword.
[142:02.77]Stick it in there.
[142:05.85]You draw your sword and slip it under the object, then lever hard.
[142:09.97]The object flips up into the air with a snap and lands nearby.
[142:13.50]It is a skull.
[142:15.40]A short, bony stake is left in the ground.
[142:19.78]Got a skull.
[142:21.88]Keep the skull.
[142:22.80]That I can now read people's minds.
[142:24.38]Got it.
[142:25.90]You put the skull into your pack in case it should come in useful later.
[142:28.61]Though what you cannot think, you don't know.
[142:31.01]You stride onwards.
[142:32.47]Now we can read people's minds.
[142:33.59]Got the cap back.
[142:37.18]That comes in handy way more than you possibly can imagine.
[142:40.80]Alright, this is where the steps were.
[142:43.89]This is where the serpent steps were.
[142:49.19]Days likely to clear yet despite their size, the wind has scored away.
[142:51.93]Okay.
[142:52.99]So where did that start?
[142:54.43]Was it here?
[142:54.93]It was like right here, right?
[143:03.31]Which way was it?
[143:09.88]Maybe it's only a certain time of day.
[143:14.28]I think it maybe it has to be nighttime.
[143:17.61]I don't know where the tracks go.
[143:20.05]You're now walking across scattered rocks the mid afternoon.
[143:23.45]Honestly, I thought my like frames are dropping.
[143:27.55]I just had a heart attack.
[143:30.05]We're still going, though.
[143:30.93]That's good.
[143:32.05]7 o'clock.
[143:33.71]I'm going to say in an hour.
[143:35.99]In about one hour from now, we're probably going to die.
[143:41.17]It's going to drop.
[143:42.68]I just glanced over and thought I saw the frames dropping, but we're good.
[143:47.84]So plan for another hour before the stream goes...
[143:52.84]You're walking, blah blah blah, the mid-afternoon heat flows the region, sitting in the low rocks and humming to himself as a dwarf.
[143:58.37]Over his shoulder is a cloth string bag.
[144:06.09]Greet him.
[144:08.13]Greeting stranger, you hail, striding towards him.
[144:10.55]The dwarf peers back.
[144:12.50]And what are you?
[144:13.50]He demands.
[144:14.10]Are you here to rob me?
[144:17.36]No, you need not fear me.
[144:19.48]I'm reassuring you, don't fear me.
[144:21.14]Oof.
[144:22.94]As he talks, he slings his bag onto his lap and opens it.
[144:25.74]From inside, he removes a chunk of heavy, blackened bread.
[144:29.22]You want some?
[144:32.26]Thanks.
[144:33.72]You sit down at a rock close by the dwarf, and he hands you a chunk of bread.
[144:38.19]It is stale and dry, but still provides some nourishment to starve off the worst of your hunger.
[144:45.71]You already wore food in that bag?
[144:48.49]What are you doing out here?
[144:50.38]Looking about, hoping for better.
[144:52.73]The dwarf eats his bread and awaits.
[144:55.11]Have you been to Dwarftown in Calais?
[144:57.39]It's a hole.
[144:58.63]I wanted a break off of my own.
[145:00.53]Get away from all the fighting.
[145:04.83]That's interesting.
[145:05.77]Bye.
[145:07.33]What's your name?
[145:09.05]Mist.
[145:10.21]Stupid name for a dwarf.
[145:11.85]Dwarfs have names like Gutterpace, not names like Mist.
[145:15.30]But me parents thought they were something different, didn't they?
[145:18.60]The dwarf casts a quick, worried look about him up the mountain slope.
[145:24.11]Are you being chased?
[145:25.91]I hope not.
[145:27.29]I tell you this, there's something evil at the top.
[145:31.28]A serpent?
[145:32.40]He shakes his head.
[145:33.92]I have no idea and I don't want to know.
[145:35.84]But whatever it is, it brots out the sun.
[145:39.28]Great, great like accent we got going here.
[145:47.77]Is there any way across the mountains?
[145:51.09]I've been wandering this plain for two months.
[145:53.49]Ever since I left Kare, I've not found one yet.
[145:57.85]Any more food in that bag?
[145:59.66]Yes.
[146:02.18]Let it go.
[146:03.84]Sell it to me.
[146:05.26]Sell it to me.
[146:06.90]Got no use for gold.
[146:08.32]Can't eat gold.
[146:10.68]Let it go.
[146:12.18]I'll pay you handsomely.
[146:14.98]You can dress my dead body up nice.
[146:17.68]But starvation's not what I'm looking for.
[146:20.47]Let it go.
[146:21.61]You changed the subject.
[146:22.51]It is clear the dwarf will not part with any of his belongings.
[146:25.23]See ya.
[146:27.27]Bye.
[146:27.59]I won't.
[146:29.83]No one does out here.
[146:31.83]You march forward.
[146:33.85]No, I, he, he, I, the narrator said that, not me.
[146:37.22]I'm going up here.
[146:39.56]This is where the, uh, the god shit was, right?
[146:44.74]The rocks underfoot soon turn to a slope, and the slope gets steeper until the going is hard and you are heaving for breath.
[146:51.04]Slowly, the sun begins to lower in the sky.
[146:54.30]From the middle distance, a curious sound reaches your ears.
[146:58.60]So I came here in the past.
[147:04.61]New subs?
[147:05.27]I didn't even see.
[147:06.95]Thanks for reminding me.
[147:08.31]Thank you, SimplySquib.
[147:09.51]Thank you, SecondSun, for your subs.
[147:12.19]Welcome to the channel.
[147:15.30]Abbot J, thanks for the 100 bits.
[147:16.42]You do realize that people expect some form of clown content from you?
[147:18.84]They're gonna get it.
[147:20.06]You will get clown content from me.
[147:21.80]It's eventually, I promise.
[147:23.10]It's gonna happen.
[147:24.82]Uh, thanks NotZelda for the 69 bits.
[147:27.18]Fuck the timeline, go punch him.
[147:29.98]Not gonna happen.
[147:34.02]Can I do a Louis Armstrong voice?
[147:35.72]Absolutely not.
[147:37.06]Uh, no way.
[147:40.46]I would, I would like hurt myself if I tried.
[147:44.08]Curious sound.
[147:44.64]Let's stop and listen.
[147:47.89]You stop and listen.
[147:48.61]The sound is some kind of screech.
[147:50.69]Quiet but close at hand.
[147:52.67]But the mountainside is barren and there's nothing that could be causing the sound.
[147:55.51]Hmm.
[148:07.94]This is where the go- Okay, so hold on.
[148:09.66]If in the past, there was like a good thing here, what happens here in the present?
[148:20.02]Sense danger.
[148:25.40]Whoa!
[148:26.20]You spin the constellations into shape around you and a familiar calm voice begins to speak to you.
[148:30.60]It tells you there is nothing to fear here, but that close at hand in the mountains, a serpent awaits.
[148:37.42]This message delivered, the voice fades.
[148:40.58]Okay, there's a serpent up here.
[148:41.92]But what the... No, no, danger!
[148:44.44]You've barely finished the spell when something happens.
[148:46.49]A fearful shape begins to form.
[148:48.23]What?
[148:48.79]What?
[148:49.05]A dark-cowled creature with a skull-like head.
[148:51.31]It seems your spell somehow missed this.
[148:54.97]Oh, yeah.
[148:56.49]That's quite the thing to miss, dolphin.
[149:01.63]It beckons with a single bony finger.
[149:05.57]Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[149:08.41]There's nothing to fear here.
[149:10.87]But there's a serpent somewhere.
[149:14.59]Maybe this thing's not bad.
[149:19.76]I've got a feeling this is not bad.
[149:21.46]Do you think the dolphin's going to betray me?
[149:26.86]We have never been betrayed by the dolphin.
[149:29.03]Never.
[149:32.55]What can I do here?
[149:37.49]I should have sensed darkness.
[149:40.93]Dim?
[149:41.83]Cause stupidity.
[149:44.71]I don't think I can make a wraith stupid.
[149:50.48]Fix?
[149:50.94]Cause fixedness.
[149:52.08]What the hell does that mean?
[149:56.55]Dolphin is working- Oh, Jesus, Ruby R. Dolphin is working for Lorag.
[150:01.48]I love how you spent a hundred bucks to write that.
[150:08.74]Hey, you know, Dolphin's working for Lorag.
[150:10.46]Here's a hundred dollars.
[150:12.63]Jeez, man.
[150:13.91]Thank you.
[150:15.95]That's fucking... That's a lot of money.
[150:22.66]It's much appreciated, dude.
[150:24.66]And also to Squidward, thanks for 100 bits.
[150:27.46]Thank you, Prenn, for two months.
[150:29.46]Thank you, Croacher, for the 100 bits.
[150:32.72]And Minkfur with 500.
[150:34.20]A Salmon Moose.
[150:35.76]What is that?
[150:36.88]Thanks for the five, nonetheless.
[150:40.01]Should have sensed darkness.
[150:41.67]I know.
[150:42.73]That's like my favorite thing.
[150:45.35]You know, I'll be cautious here.
[150:46.49]I can protect from magic.
[150:48.53]And I'll walk up to him.
[150:49.85]What do you guys think?
[150:52.79]Walk his shield.
[150:55.53]I'll protect myself.
[151:03.19]What else?
[151:03.61]Yeah, yeah.
[151:04.32]I'm going to put a magic shield on.
[151:07.34]What can I do with this?
[151:10.90]Sense danger.
[151:11.80]Or I can... I can clone myself.
[151:14.46]Okay, here's what we're going to do.
[151:17.23]Clone myself.
[151:20.25]You cast a spell and five clones step out from behind you, forming a semicircle.
[151:26.02]The response from the Deathwraith is immediate.
[151:28.41]It yelps in alarm and begins to back away towards a craggy rock.
[151:37.64]Follow it.
[151:38.84]You and your clones press forward, encircling the death wraith.
[151:43.05]It is growing alarmed and moving backwards quickly.
[151:45.53]Suddenly it trips, landing on the ground with an extremely unspectral thunk.
[151:54.19]Wait and watch.
[151:56.78]The monster crawls a short distance away, and the shimmering haze once more returns, engulfing the death wraith completely.
[152:03.36]When it fades, the apparition has disappeared, and in its place a stout, balding man who whimpers and nurses his wounds.
[152:12.50]Enough!
[152:13.36]Let me be!
[152:13.88]I mean you no harm!
[152:15.27]Ow!
[152:20.57]What is the meaning of this?
[152:22.21]You ask in surprise of the whimpering wreck?
[152:26.65]Thanks, face a lot.
[152:28.68]The creature does not take his arms from over his head.
[152:31.83]Leave Renfren alone.
[152:33.67]He never does any harm.
[152:34.71]Just a little merriment, that's all.
[152:36.81]Behind you, the apparition has vanished, a mere illusion.
[152:41.51]Yeah.
[152:43.37]Once he saw the six of us fucking barreling down at him.
[152:47.86]Wouldn't be so tough without your friends, you bully.
[152:51.30]Yeah, we like walked over there like, oh, what are you going to say about the fuck?
[152:54.18]You got something to say?
[152:55.30]There's six people here.
[153:00.79]Uh... I mean you no harm.
[153:06.21]You declare sheathing your sword, which is more than could be said for you.
[153:10.91]The man squirms with self-pity.
[153:12.91]Of course, of course.
[153:14.46]I should have known better when I saw you.
[153:16.18]I knew.
[153:16.72]I thought.
[153:17.96]You are a warrior.
[153:18.92]You're a wizard.
[153:19.60]I could tell.
[153:20.08]I could tell!
[153:20.66]And you tried to trick me.
[153:23.82]From his pockets, he produces a spiked metal disc and a yellow vial of powder.
[153:27.60]Take them!
[153:27.92]Take them, please!
[153:31.61]What the fuck are these?
[153:33.31]What's in the vial?
[153:35.45]I don't know what the powder is.
[153:36.57]I just like the color.
[153:40.19]Disc or powder?
[153:44.37]Disc or powder?
[153:46.81]Murder him, please.
[153:52.69]What is a metal disc gonna do?
[153:59.94]Don't I already have a yellow vial?
[154:02.90]I think I already have that.
[154:03.70]I'm gonna take the disc.
[154:07.06]You take the metal disc.
[154:11.68]Take them both.
[154:12.16]Fuck this guy.
[154:14.46]You lift a vial of yellow powder to the light as you take it.
[154:16.46]It's a fine, grainy powder, the color of unchafed wheat or pus.
[154:21.57]Thank you.
[154:22.09]Thank you.
[154:22.83]Oh, bowing.
[154:23.41]I'm bowing.
[154:23.79]This is me bowing to you.
[154:27.25]Old bag don't need him anyways.
[154:31.93]How did you conjure the Death Wraith?
[154:34.65]He shrugs.
[154:35.67]Oh, it's just a thing I learned to do.
[154:37.49]It's all smoke and mirrors, you know.
[154:40.21]Then show me your mirror.
[154:42.11]Of course, of course, of course.
[154:43.67]You step back a little and I'll show you my... Oh, hold on a second.
[154:46.23]Let me redo that.
[154:47.63]Of course, of course.
[154:48.81]You step back a little and I'll show you my apparatus.
[154:51.25]It's in the ground, you see.
[154:53.79]Step back.
[154:55.29]You step a few paces back.
[154:56.31]He looks at you, thinks a moment, then waves a hand.
[154:59.43]A few steps further.
[155:04.79]This is far enough.
[155:06.73]Oh, yes, yes, yes.
[155:07.49]That will probably be far enough.
[155:09.49]He moves to one side, putting a low boulder between you and him.
[155:12.92]Then he starts running as fast as his legs will carry him.
[155:15.36]I'm fucking chasing him.
[155:16.82]You chase after him, feet flying downhill, but clearly Renfren knows every step of the route.
[155:22.08]As he's chosen a path over loose stones and rocking rocks, and after a few steps, you lose your footing and fall painfully.
[155:29.65]Renfren disappears out of sight.
[155:35.53]You piece of shit!
[155:37.59]You hurl a curse after him and hear a distant yelp in reply.
[155:40.41]Fuck you!
[155:42.27]Picking yourself to your feet, you look about.
[155:43.62]The mountain pass continues up from here.
[155:45.74]Or you could return to the plane below.
[155:51.50]Now this is different.
[155:52.50]I kind of want to see what this is like in the present.
[155:58.94]You return up the winding path to the top of the mountain.
[156:01.62]One by one, your clones vanish.
[156:03.58]What, they were still with me?
[156:08.32]I still had like six people.
[156:11.32]What were they doing that whole time?
[156:15.22]Where were those clones?
[156:17.26]They're just standing around.
[156:18.38]Why didn't they chase him?
[156:23.26]Wait, what?
[156:25.68]By the way, your clones are gone.
[156:29.20]Suddenly the sun is snuffled out like a candle.
[156:34.15]A hissing sound begins to echo around the rocks and overhead a larger moon than usual seems to rise from the horizon.
[156:39.64]Another trick.
[156:40.76]Hold on.
[156:43.04]Moon.
[156:44.12]Snake.
[156:45.46]Moon serpent.
[156:48.54]Moon serpent.
[156:49.16]What is it?
[156:50.50]Clues.
[156:52.01]The moon serpent.
[156:53.33]The moon serpent is deathly afraid of fire.
[156:57.21]Oh boy.
[156:59.25]Are you guys ready to cast a fireball at the moon serpent?
[157:06.94]Hold on, let's just get fucking... Should I drink the holy water?
[157:10.20]No.
[157:10.41]I wish I could cook this meat.
[157:16.29]It's all about the heart, man.
[157:20.79]Okay, I'm gonna get ready.
[157:22.59]Ready, uh... Stop to look.
[157:26.19]There he is.
[157:27.19]You look up in surprise.
[157:28.39]The shape rises a little higher, a strange, almost translucent ball.
[157:32.57]Then the round shape uncoils itself.
[157:34.97]The shimmering body of the Moon Serpent is revealed, hovering in the air above you.
[157:39.39]Its wide fangs are open and it is coming for you.
[157:42.96]Oh, excuse me, Mr. Moon Serpent.
[157:45.68]I'm sorry.
[157:47.08]But, you know, you're about to be burnt to death.
[157:51.64]H. Oh, no, that's not H. That's S.
[157:56.58]What's going on here?
[157:58.66]H. O. T. Burn him!
[158:07.13]Looking to the star as you craft the magic, summoning a fireball in your palm, the serpent's eyes glitter in the light.
[158:12.79]It does not seem scared.
[158:14.63]Oh, well, throw it at him.
[158:17.57]The flames of the burning fireball gutter as it flies through the air towards the serpent, but you score a direct hit, and the fire quickly spreads across the creature's skin.
[158:26.52]It seems fire truly is the serpent's weakness.
[158:29.24]One by one, the scales pop from its hide, peeling back and falling like leaves to the rocks below.
[158:34.22]The creature is screaming now, in pain and terror.
[158:37.86]Kill it!
[158:40.32]You draw your sword, ready to finish the serpent off.
[158:42.20]The serpent darts low, and you set yourself a battle.
[158:44.64]Six out of eleven, and look at that stamina.
[158:48.38]Oh.
[158:49.29]Oh!
[159:25.09]I was so anti-climactic.
[159:27.53]I built that up so much.
[159:33.35]I was really getting into that.
[159:34.55]I was getting into character and explaining.
[159:37.53]Let me do a narration here.
[159:39.31]And then I fucking die instantly.
[159:49.31]Rewind to punch the guy.
[159:54.88]That's very funny.
[159:57.76]Oh, that was so embarrassing.
[159:59.78]Okay, pretend you didn't see that.
[160:01.22]Pretend you didn't see that.
[160:01.98]I only died 15.
[160:02.70]That's 15.
[160:07.73]Okay.
[160:08.87]Let's go 6.9.
[160:09.21]Oh, shit.
[160:11.21]I almost died again.
[160:13.45]I can do it again.
[160:14.01]Full blast again.
[160:15.77]Instantly dead.
[160:16.56]See you later.
[160:19.90]That was easy.
[160:23.58]Oh, that hurt.
[160:26.05]My pride.
[160:27.75]You press your advantage knowing only too well.
[160:29.73]This is a fight to the death.
[160:31.03]You jump blade low and strong.
[160:33.42]The moon serpent's eyes narrow to a close and crescents fall dark.
[160:37.20]Yeah, yeah.
[160:37.68]Its body seems to crumble before your eyes.
[160:40.06]Hey, no stamina loss.
[160:41.32]Flawless fighting.
[160:47.59]You have now defeated two of the seven serpents.
[160:50.61]The darkness in the sky disappears and the sun returns.
[160:54.42]As the serpent dies, it seems to coil up, shriveling away until all that remains is a small crystal orb.
[161:04.59]Take the orb.
[161:06.59]You lift the orb.
[161:07.99]It is a precious artifact of great power.
[161:10.29]You put it carefully into your pack.
[161:12.11]The bleak mountainside falls silent around you.
[161:15.65]Your good cheer is tempered by the knowledge that you have barely begun to defeat your enemies.
[161:19.25]There are, after all, still five serpents left.
[161:27.40]Oh, boy.
[161:28.74]Thank you Ender Rourke for the sub.
[161:30.32]Ender Rourke for the sub.
[161:32.64]Kyma8man.
[161:35.12]Hideous Fascination.
[161:36.50]Thank you for the subscriptions, guys.
[161:37.90]Welcome.
[161:39.26]Thank you Minkfur for the five bucks.
[161:41.10]GG no re.
[161:43.28]Cryfix for 100 bits.
[161:44.48]All the clones must have slipped and fallen at the same time.
[161:48.92]Thank you Fortress Final for the eight months.
[161:51.46]Minkfur again with the 100 bits.
[161:53.54]And that was... He told me to take them.
[161:55.02]The old bag don't need them from earlier.
[161:58.33]Thank you, NextSTV.
[162:01.23]And I think I space a lot of subscribers.
[162:03.13]I missed another subscription back here, too.
[162:07.89]Did I get Kindex?
[162:09.89]I don't think I did, but welcome, nonetheless.
[162:11.65]Thank you, guys.
[162:14.53]Oh, the whale is the new god.
[162:15.91]I guess.
[162:17.23]You know what?
[162:20.93]Wasn't I standing here before when I got the dolphin?
[162:24.14]So I was standing there and I did something in particular that got the dolphin to leave and the whale.
[162:28.63]A slow, careful creature of great wisdom and deep honor.
[162:31.79]The whale moves through deep, dark places but leaves barely a ripple on the surface.
[162:38.11]So I guess he's... My spirit is the... My god's the whale.
[162:44.36]Alright.
[162:48.56]Okay, that's a scrying orb.
[162:53.22]Let's take a look around the clearing.
[162:54.32]That's two out of seven.
[162:56.24]You look around the clearing, the marks of your battle with the moon serpent are still visible in the dirt.
[162:59.78]There is nothing else here except for a little stonework by the eastern edge of the plateau.
[163:04.27]The remains of a building, perhaps?
[163:05.73]Or a ledge?
[163:14.18]Another piece protrudes a short distance away.
[163:15.76]Whatever was here was large and beautifully wrought once, but now is gone.
[163:45.66]Look west.
[163:47.72]Did you puke?
[163:48.42]Are you okay?
[163:49.36]I'm fine.
[163:50.09]I'm gonna be fine.
[163:50.81]I just kind of got a little overzealous.
[163:54.27]Looking back west across the plains, you spy a dark smudge on the land, a cloud of black dust rising from the wheels of the caravan.
[164:04.65]No, alright, alright.
[164:08.05]I'm becoming a certain... No, I had to, like, burp, and then I was like, alright, fine, I'm gonna do it, and then I'm gonna make, like, a funny noise, like, quotes of funny noise at the end.
[164:16.06]And it just ended up, like, hurting my body and sounding awful.
[164:19.78]That was not cool.
[164:21.40]I'm sorry about that one.
[164:26.24]Alright, uh... The caravan you encountered earlier seems to not have moved.
[164:30.97]So I'm definitely not gonna go back there.
[164:32.39]This is the... East is the bridge...
[164:34.67]The edge of the forest of Snata, dark and tangled.
[164:37.50]Somewhere beyond is the distant glitter of Lake Ikalia, which you must somehow get across.
[164:43.44]Okay.
[164:45.52]The drop is not vertical on the eastern plateau, after all, but skitters away from the mountainside.
[164:50.22]You might be able to skid down it, though you couldn't walk, and there would be a constant danger of rolling.
[164:55.88]Time to head for lower ground one way or another.
[164:58.99]Oh shit, I can skid down.
[165:06.02]I feel like this is going to hurt, but we're going to do it.
[165:09.64]This is going to hurt, but we're going to do it.
[165:11.90]You step onto the foot of the ruined bridge and then over.
[165:14.22]You drop a few feet to the slope below in a controlled fashion, and then you begin to skid, sliding and slipping down the loose stones.
[165:21.14]You are gathering speed fast.
[165:24.74]Oh boy.
[165:27.01]Don't kill me.
[165:27.70]Don't kill me.
[165:28.12]Don't kill me.
[165:28.50]Don't kill me.
[165:31.00]Your boots shoot out from underneath you and you skid down the slope on your cloak, arms out backwards to try and keep you level.
[165:37.80]You're about halfway to the thick trees below.
[165:42.03]I could pray to the whale.
[165:43.63]Or I could... To cast a spell, you have to lift both hands and craft a starlight, which means you will not be able to hold yourself in balance.
[165:55.24]Huh.
[165:56.70]Uh, I could pray to the whale?
[166:00.19]Yeah.
[166:00.75]Yeah.
[166:02.69]Pray for aid.
[166:04.52]To pray, you need to close your eyes despite the rushing wind, the scattering stones, the sudden precipices that come and go.
[166:12.25]Then you skid suddenly onto your side, losing your balance.
[166:14.79]The canopy approaches at speed.
[166:17.97]I can't pray.
[166:20.09]I'm lying like I'm in a fucking water slide right now with my arms down.
[166:25.10]Like, what the hell am I doing?
[166:28.98]You hit the ground painfully, avoiding a broken neck and a broken leg by a mere miracle.
[166:34.37]A miracle?
[166:36.51]It takes several minutes to regain your breath.
[166:40.23]I'm sorry to have ever doubted you, Will.
[166:43.41]Because, I mean, thank you.
[166:46.54]I talked a lot of shit right there.
[166:48.38]But thank you, Will.
[166:51.88]Uh, look back.
[166:54.59]You cast a look back at the mountain slope, but it is all but sheer.
[166:57.81]There is no way to climb it again.
[166:59.87]You will have to move onwards.
[167:01.77]You pick yourself up to your feet.
[167:03.29]You're on the edge of thick trees with no discernible path forward.
[167:06.78]You'll have to fight through the trees as best you can.
[167:10.06]Uh-oh.
[167:11.76]Uh, do I have... I don't really have anything to drink.
[167:25.31]Through the forest.
[167:28.67]You barge your way through the thick trees, pushing branches from your face.
[167:32.01]Things chitter in the leaves all around.
[167:35.45]Keep moving.
[167:36.63]You crash on through.
[167:37.49]No, you don't stop here.
[167:38.78]I have such bad footing.
[167:39.90]I have one stamina.
[167:40.84]Get me out of the forest.
[167:44.52]You erupt from the trees into an old path that winds a narrow course through the forest.
[167:49.04]The trees loom around you, twisted and old.
[167:51.91]There were forests in the Shumanadi Hills, but nothing in comparison to this.
[167:57.91]Waste no time.
[167:59.74]But despite its size and its age, it is nothing but trees.
[168:02.62]You keep walking.
[168:04.04]The forest is beautiful in its own way.
[168:06.12]Water drips down the leaves and along twisted vines.
[168:08.85]Birds flutter through the bracken-like canopy.
[168:11.51]Everything is moist and damp.
[168:13.69]The path is winding and frequently disappears.
[168:15.93]Perhaps it has been made by animals and not by people.
[168:20.91]Could climb a tree.
[168:23.97]Climb a tree for a view, keep walking.
[168:29.06]Keep going.
[168:29.80]I don't want to spend much time here.
[168:30.92]You continue to walk.
[168:31.56]You must reach Eklela and the road to lower Zaman.
[168:36.12]Every passing day brings danger.
[168:37.48]What do you guys think?
[168:47.97]North or south?
[168:49.21]Or east or north?
[168:51.33]East or south?
[168:54.05]Alright.
[168:54.59]We'll do a poll because I really don't know which way to go.
[168:59.57]Don't really know, I'd rather have you guys decide.
[169:02.98]Which way?
[169:06.24]East or south?
[169:14.71]Which way are we gonna go?
[169:15.55]Remember, east is this way, south is this way.
[169:20.33]Why did I need to tell you guys that?
[169:23.55]Remember, guys, up is up and down is down.
[169:28.07]Remember, it's important.
[169:29.43]Up is that way, straight up, and down is down, you know?
[169:43.06]Okey dokey.
[169:45.74]East has a pretty considerable lead.
[169:51.86]In the book, hot instantly kills the moon serpent.
[169:54.73]That's cool.
[169:56.21]And while we have a second here, thank you, Frisky Moose.
[169:59.23]Thank you, Masterman Mike.
[170:01.25]MLG Kevin.
[170:03.09]Sir Sandwich.
[170:04.13]Ender Rourke.
[170:05.57]I already got these guys.
[170:07.31]But thank you all for subscribing.
[170:08.59]And thanks to Nasty Ketchup for 100 bits.
[170:12.64]You're pretty good.
[170:13.24]Well, hey, you're pretty good, Ketchup.
[170:14.48]Thanks.
[170:17.46]Southcut Shadon.
[170:18.94]Yeah, it kind of did, didn't it?
[170:30.45]And we are getting dangerously close to where my internet died last night.
[170:36.23]Dangerously close.
[170:39.51]It's getting to be about 8 p.m.
[170:41.15]Eastern.
[170:42.77]So if it happens, it could happen here in the next like 30, 20 to 30 minutes.
[170:50.36]Just giving fair warning that I apologize in advance if the stream goes down.
[170:58.10]Does anyone remember exactly what time it was last night that the stream actually crashed?
[171:07.07]Dangerously cheesy.
[171:15.37]Alright.
[171:16.21]Poll is now closed.
[171:17.67]That is it.
[171:18.97]East has substantially won.
[171:25.05]Going east.
[171:30.10]around 908 okay 833 the stream crashes at 666 yeah it's we're getting close that's all I know is that like it's gonna it will happen but we'll see thanks for coming regardless if it just crashes so let's go
[171:49.49]You walk on between the trees.
[171:50.79]Another night begins and you are very weak.
[171:52.85]Oh fuck, I really am very weak.
[171:54.31]You should find a place to sleep.
[171:56.07]The forest by night is a terrifying place, full of strange noises and shifting shadows.
[172:00.57]You are certain something is following you.
[172:02.73]But when you turn, there is nothing there.
[172:06.87]Am I getting, like, delirious?
[172:18.56]Forcefield.
[172:20.70]I don't have enough stamina to cast a spell, I don't think.
[172:22.38]Unless it's something like Yap.
[172:26.04]Invisibility.
[172:27.96]Invisibility is no stamina.
[172:29.87]You just put the ring on.
[172:32.11]That's so awesome.
[172:37.27]Sense danger.
[172:37.85]I can't sense danger.
[172:38.89]I'm just gonna go invisible.
[172:46.37]Should I just go invisible?
[172:48.99]Can this be like the best spell in the whole game?
[172:53.65]Put it on.
[172:56.62]You slip on the pearl ring and craft a spell.
[172:58.40]As you wait, a fog extends from the jewel of the ring surrounding your body.
[173:01.96]You step onwards through the forest, but nothing stops you.
[173:05.14]The smell of rotting leaf mulch fills your nostrils.
[173:10.31]What?
[173:15.07]Okay, can I like sleep with the invisibility ring on?
[173:20.41]If I go to bed right here, and I just keep the ring on, then I'll be safe.
[173:28.85]Rest here.
[173:30.81]Putting down your pack by the roots of a tree, you try to rest despite the strange noises that float across the landscape.
[173:35.74]At least you have eaten once today.
[173:38.60]You close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you.
[173:41.26]You wake suddenly.
[173:42.32]There is a flapping of dark wings from overhead.
[173:44.64]A giant bat is circling above you.
[173:46.88]Your journey has been plagued by these creatures.
[173:52.01]I thought I was fucking invisible.
[173:53.55]I thought I was invisible.
[174:00.47]Cause depression.
[174:01.77]Make the bat depressed.
[174:07.65]I can't do zap, it'll kill me.
[174:11.67]Wait, I do have a grenade.
[174:13.99]Grenades cost no stamina.
[174:17.17]I'm throwing a bomb at him.
[174:20.14]You move the starlight into order around you over one of your pebbles, then you lob the stone at the bat.
[174:24.74]It explodes on impact, and when the smoke clears, the air above you is quite empty.
[174:29.44]The dewy light from your pearl ring fades and disappears.
[174:33.63]I was invisible.
[174:37.11]I actually was invisible right there.
[174:38.99]He just could, like, smell me.
[174:44.81]I was fucking invisible.
[174:48.17]Yeah, I just lobbed it at him.
[174:51.04]You've grown weaker, reached the forest of Snata, and you defeated the moon serpent, meaning there are now only five serpents remaining.
[174:59.24]Bats are blind?
[175:01.04]Bats are blind.
[175:06.98]Bats are blind.
[175:08.84]It wouldn't have mattered anyways.
[175:14.60]I love that.
[175:15.20]That's great.
[175:17.40]I'm invisible.
[175:18.10]The bat can't see me.
[175:19.21]Well, duh, he can't anyways.
[175:22.44]Pile of boulders here is topped with a patch of the yellow moss.
[175:25.18]Eat it.
[175:27.90]Fucking stash it.
[175:29.16]I'm not going to eat it this time.
[175:32.02]What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[175:33.88]You stole the moss in your pack, but it quickly dries and crumbles to dust.
[175:42.34]God damn it.
[175:46.18]You squat down and rest.
[175:47.14]You feel great.
[175:48.00]Okay.
[175:50.12]That's great.
[175:50.80]I would have just eaten it, but I wanted to save it when I actually really needed it.
[175:57.36]Do giant bats stalk at night?
[175:58.78]Yeah, they do.
[176:02.99]The moaning winds finger at your pack and soar the time has come to walk.
[176:08.59]Great.
[176:09.93]That's just great.
[176:14.12]This is different.
[176:16.72]You follow what might be a path and might be an old river through the trees of the forest.
[176:20.98]The sun is hot now.
[176:22.59]You emerge from the trees into a clearing by a low hill.
[176:25.75]This is an exposed place.
[176:27.81]You'd be unwise to stay long.
[176:33.53]Skirt the hill.
[176:36.20]Alright, looks like I'm going around.
[176:40.28]Missed moss.
[176:42.95]You skirt around the north side of the hillock.
[176:45.39]Hillock?
[176:45.79]Hillock?
[176:46.67]There's something quite artificial about its shape.
[176:49.19]Its sides are almost perfectly smooth.
[176:53.26]Let's go in.
[176:53.82]I'm just going right in.
[176:54.52]You have the sense that things are watching you from the trees.
[176:56.56]Time to move on.
[176:59.74]I'm going right in this person's house.
[177:02.96]As you pass the southeast side of the hillock, you come across an incongruous wooden doorway set into the curvature of the hill.
[177:13.16]Look at the door.
[177:14.56]You step over to the doorway to examine it more closely.
[177:18.22]The door.
[177:20.96]The door is made of heavy wood carved with various runes and symbols in a language you do not know.
[177:28.29]Wrap.
[177:29.75]We're going for wrap.
[177:30.43]I can understand all languages.
[177:31.41]Maybe I should knock.
[177:34.77]I'm going to knock.
[177:36.45]You knock on the door.
[177:37.03]There is no reply.
[177:41.35]I got some stamina.
[177:42.01]I think I can cast a spell.
[177:50.37]No, we're not doing zap when I can just do dop and open the fucking door for free.
[177:55.41]Open the door.
[177:56.17]Lock some doors.
[177:56.71]You weave the enchantment and the door swings open, revealing a dark passage beyond.
[178:01.13]I'm gonna shock that door and it's gonna bounce back and hit me in the fucking head.
[178:06.70]No, I'm not doing zap.
[178:10.63]The door opens through a short, dark hallway, descends into the hill.
[178:14.05]Is this a tomb?
[178:16.18]You begin to see a glowing light ahead and hear a voice muttering low, angry curses.
[178:20.12]Just get my weapon out.
[178:24.05]Your hand reaches down to pull out your weapon, but as you touch it, a jolt passes up your arm, causing you to pull away quickly.
[178:31.72]Okay, leave it be.
[178:33.29]Clearly something magical is preventing you from drawing your blade.
[178:35.77]You take a deep breath.
[178:37.49]You will have to survive on your wits alone.
[178:40.41]A little sunshine falls through the doorway.
[178:42.65]There's still time to turn back.
[178:47.75]Okay.
[178:51.54]Let's go in.
[178:52.24]Deeper in.
[178:54.96]You keep moving forward, and the passage quickly opens out.
[178:58.31]You enter a small room lit by a single candle on a wooden table.
[179:02.29]Seated at the table is a spindly creature, a spinely creature, whose attention is focused only on a glass orb set on a plinth.
[179:12.16]Watch the creature.
[179:15.52]Oh shit.
[179:17.22]You watch as the creature stares into their orb, which swirls with colors and shapes.
[179:21.44]It mumbles something quietly.
[179:25.19]Is this a serpent?
[179:26.17]Is this like a fucking crystal serpent?
[179:32.71]You open your mouth to announce to yourself, but the silence is broken by a squeaky voice.
[179:37.33]Yes, yes, yes, alright.
[179:38.43]Don't stammer like a half-orc.
[179:39.57]I'm busy.
[179:40.01]Sit down.
[179:40.49]A thin finger gestures towards a chair in the corner.
[179:48.40]Sit down.
[179:49.72]You sit down as instructed.
[179:51.14]After a few minutes, the creature leans back from her orb and looks up at you.
[179:55.07]So, a visitor, a human too.
[180:01.73]Hi.
[180:03.27]Greetings to you indeed.
[180:05.31]As light from the glass orb fades a little, you see the speaker is a woman, some kind of elf.
[180:11.74]Elves are, I've had a couple of run-ins.
[180:16.06]Though she appears somewhat disfigured.
[180:19.02]Look at her.
[180:20.38]Her eyes are too large and they seem to glow softly of their own accord, accounting for a good portion of the light down here.
[180:26.44]Don't be alarmed by my appearance.
[180:28.48]My illness is not contagious.
[180:31.02]Whoa, stand back, what the fuck?
[180:33.34]The fixture does not go unnoticed.
[180:36.56]What excellent company you are.
[180:39.17]Quite delightful.
[180:40.85]Now, human, as my time is more precious than yours, I will soon lose my patience with you.
[180:46.15]I am Fenestra.
[180:47.97]What in Gred's name are you doing in this miserable forest?
[180:55.67]Just get right to the point.
[180:56.41]I'm looking for the serpents.
[180:58.29]Do you know of them?
[180:59.49]She stiffens.
[181:00.91]I do indeed.
[181:01.99]Her tone is wary.
[181:04.09]What prey is your interest?
[181:08.82]I serve the Archmage.
[181:10.26]She was talking... That glass orb had a fucking serpent in it.
[181:16.76]Look at this.
[181:17.88]Look at that serpent eye and that serpent in there.
[181:22.04]I'm gonna fucking bullshit her.
[181:24.62]I serve the Archmage, you lie.
[181:27.66]Fenestra nods.
[181:29.16]As do the serpents.
[181:30.86]Well, stranger, I have not seen the serpents myself, only heard of their great power.
[181:36.85]And is that all?
[181:39.67]Just kidding, I'm a traveler.
[181:40.71]Uh...
[181:48.66]I seek the crown of kings.
[181:51.90]Then you are the Adalander whom the serpents wish to destroy.
[181:55.12]Yeah.
[181:56.18]Yeah.
[181:57.20]Well met.
[181:58.55]I will tell you what I know of them.
[182:00.87]Gred knows the serpents are no friends of mine.
[182:03.79]Her voice shakes as she speaks.
[182:05.39]She speaks.
[182:08.45]Let her speak.
[182:10.37]The water serpent killed my father.
[182:12.71]This I shall never forgive.
[182:16.35]Sorry for your loss.
[182:18.09]Thank you.
[182:19.53]My father did not know the weakness of the water serpent, so he could not survive its attack.
[182:25.30]And by the way, you already fucking know this.
[182:28.30]I'll destroy that serpent for you.
[182:29.76]Oil.
[182:30.22]I know what it is.
[182:31.98]A champion?
[182:33.46]Well, I've never had a champion before.
[182:34.96]I'm touched.
[182:36.72]From her cloak she produces a flask of oil.
[182:39.62]You take it warily.
[182:40.70]I just bumped the mic, sorry.
[182:42.08]Careful to avoid touching her skin.
[182:44.24]Water and oil do not mix.
[182:46.12]Now I keep it a store so I can spare this.
[182:50.30]I will avenge your father.
[182:52.50]Or join him, I'm sure.
[182:54.57]The orb on her table swirls with color ever more violently.
[182:58.15]Fenestra sits up sharply.
[183:00.37]You must go.
[183:00.89]I have work that must be attended to.
[183:07.46]You know any counterspells that I could be learned?
[183:10.48]Can I spells?
[183:13.08]Fenestra smiles almost casually.
[183:14.72]She tosses a handful of sand at your feet.
[183:17.04]She regards you for a moment.
[183:22.00]She's trying to teach me a counterspell.
[183:23.42]Sand.
[183:24.94]She throws sand down.
[183:31.01]What am I going to... What am I... A countersand?
[183:33.41]Or what?
[183:33.79]Should I...
[183:43.31]Cause fear.
[183:46.27]Zeff.
[183:49.08]I mean, rock, I could turn stone dust.
[183:51.78]But that's not sand.
[183:52.90]Quicksand?
[183:54.12]Okay, she's gonna throw quicksand at me.
[183:56.44]What's the count of the quicksand?
[183:57.42]Oh, I could just pick it up.
[184:11.88]Hot is not.
[184:12.92]The count is dock.
[184:14.46]I almost just accidentally casted that at her.
[184:16.96]I'm gonna pick it up.
[184:18.38]Sand is a useful component for spells, so you bend down to gather it up.
[184:22.00]But you're not fast enough.
[184:23.35]Fenestra is casting an enchantment on you.
[184:25.73]The sand in your boots begins to swirl in a narrow circle, growing faster and faster.
[184:28.85]You feel a terrible force sucking you downward into the ground.
[184:31.71]Fenestra cackles suddenly with glee.
[184:41.96]He never lets me down.
[184:44.66]He never lets me down.
[184:46.64]Pray to the whale.
[184:49.04]You close your eyes and raise a prayer to the whale.
[184:51.98]You are up to your thighs now and sinking faster and faster.
[184:55.53]Fenestra peers at you contemptuously.
[184:59.05]Are you even going to try to protect yourself?
[185:05.13]So what's the count of the quicksand?
[185:12.83]Sense danger!
[185:14.51]Sense danger!
[185:17.49]It's not light.
[185:18.28]It's definitely not light.
[185:19.06]It's like zip.
[185:20.08]It's probably zip.
[185:22.68]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[185:23.86]Where is it?
[185:24.38]Fuck.
[185:25.20]Big?
[185:25.68]I can't cast big.
[185:29.71]I can't fucking cast anything.
[185:32.87]Fog?
[185:34.09]Darkness?
[185:36.99]Teleport?
[185:38.11]Teleport?
[185:46.07]I don't have access to anything.
[185:48.55]Nog?
[185:49.53]Oh no, that's... What?
[185:52.61]Where's N?
[185:59.29]No, I didn't want to click B. N. I could do Sense Darkness.
[186:09.60]Force Field?
[186:10.16]That's three stamina.
[186:12.36]Cast Scream.
[186:14.26]Alright, Force Field.
[186:17.10]You cast a spell forming a shimmering force field around your body.
[186:19.42]You should be protected from all but the most serious injury now.
[186:22.98]The shell is quickly filled with sand grains, disconnected from the gathering whirlpool.
[186:27.88]The two spells are tearing at each other, and after a moment, both fizzle out.
[186:31.91]She nods, pleased.
[186:33.29]Very good.
[186:34.73]The spell of whirlpool is countered by that of the force field.
[186:38.87]Now go.
[186:42.23]Now I rush her.
[186:45.21]Now I sprint at her.
[186:48.72]I'm gonna sprint at her and go like... And I just get fucking insta-killed.
[186:55.69]I'm coming for you, lady.
[187:02.31]You launch forward, still enraged at how close you came to death.
[187:05.28]She produces a horn and begins to blow a long, clear note.
[187:08.26]Give me that fucking horn!
[187:09.98]You grab over to the horn, but suddenly it is as though you are fighting force through seawater.
[187:14.28]A great wind surrounds you, growing in force.
[187:16.62]Suddenly you are pushed backwards out through the door.
[187:18.94]The horn note ceases as you look around the clearing outside once more.
[187:24.53]Let me back in.
[187:25.85]I want to go back in.
[187:29.75]Oh, well.
[187:30.65]Thanks for the oil.
[187:35.84]Let's go.
[187:36.22]A wide track leads away from the door into the trees.
[187:44.51]And down we go.
[187:50.29]Things rustle in the branches all around.
[187:52.26]With a pop, your force field shimmers out of existence.
[187:55.56]The sun begins to dip heading towards the horizon.
[187:58.50]The path passes by a heavy thicket of tangled branches.
[188:03.25]What's that?
[188:04.72]The dench bushes curl up around themselves in a tangle.
[188:07.46]Peering between the branches, you can make out something covered over.
[188:12.92]I'm going to smash it with the axe.
[188:17.75]You hew the branches away with the axe in swift, easy strokes.
[188:21.57]The foliage falls away to reveal first a glassless window and then the top corner of a door.
[188:28.89]It seems the branches are growing in front of and out of an ancient hut.
[188:34.13]Cut the door free.
[188:34.85]You keep cutting until you have uncovered the door enough that you might be able to pull it open.
[188:41.27]Peer through the window.
[188:44.01]Before going inside, you think to peer in through the window.
[188:47.73]You can make a little out through the thick foliage that continues inside, but it seems the hut is otherwise empty.
[188:53.49]Then for a moment, something seems to move, but looking again, you see nothing.
[189:01.43]Open the door.
[189:03.91]You heave on the door, hauling it open.
[189:05.81]Ancient dust spills out into the forest air, and a million crawling things scuttle from holes in the ancient wood.
[189:14.99]The air from inside the hut is old and stale.
[189:17.85]Ew.
[189:18.25]Oh, gross.
[189:19.09]Oh, that's what I meant to say.
[189:20.57]But does not stink of death, decay, or animal.
[189:23.81]You look about for where to go.
[189:30.77]One stamina.
[189:36.87]You push your way inside the ancient overgrown hut.
[189:39.78]There are patches of yellow moss growing on the back wall of the hut.
[189:44.46]Handful of moss.
[189:46.02]Oh, handful of moss.
[189:46.94]You gather up a handful of moss and then you munch on the moss.
[189:50.34]Nice.
[189:51.08]Let's look around.
[189:54.18]In the thin sunlight through the windows of the hut, you can make out writings on the far wall.
[189:59.43]This is the house Eliza built, and in its doorway blood was spilt.
[190:04.70]But that blood has dried and gone, and poor Eliza is still alone.
[190:09.50]That didn't fucking rhyme well.
[190:12.74]But that blood has dried and gone, and poor Eliza is still alone.
[190:18.94]Let me read this more carefully.
[190:19.98]This is the house Eliza built, and in its doorway blood was spilt.
[190:23.72]But that blood has dried and gone, and poor Eliza is still alone.
[190:25.68]Eliza's ghost is in here.
[190:30.31]Looking at the doorway, you see the dark shadow of a bloodstain wiped carefully around the sill like a ward against an evil spirit.
[190:38.17]Not that such magic works, of course.
[190:40.23]The only true magic comes from the stars.
[190:43.03]At least, that's what they told you.
[190:45.33]There are a few more things scratched into the wood.
[190:48.87]We're gonna sense danger in here.
[190:55.15]Sense danger.
[191:01.77]Consulting the constellations overhead, you bind the spell, and a quiet voice enters your mind and informs you, quite calmly, the hut is not empty.
[191:09.60]With that, the spell fades.
[191:17.22]Look at the scratches on the door.
[191:18.94]You look at the other scratch marks.
[191:20.16]They are hard to comprehend precisely.
[191:22.36]One appears to depict a person in a circular bubble, floating harmlessly above a raging tornado or a whirlpool.
[191:28.75]Although it shows a fiery ball, perhaps the sun, perhaps not, being drenched by a fist of squeezing what looks like a handful of berries.
[191:39.23]Looking into the dim corners of the hut, you uncover an old vial of water.
[191:42.87]As you lift it to the light, it gives off a very faint shine.
[191:46.13]In your mind, you feel the whale's gentle voice.
[191:49.85]The water in this vial is blessed to the god Gredd.
[191:55.15]Oh, hi.
[191:55.61]Thanks.
[191:56.69]Thanks, whale.
[191:58.15]For randomly fucking talking.
[192:00.89]Where were you like 30 minutes ago?
[192:02.29]Now you're just gonna talk to me now?
[192:05.48]Keep it.
[192:07.84]You place the vial of holy water into your pack.
[192:09.68]A lucky find.
[192:19.59]What else can I do?
[192:25.89]Judge Gred.
[192:30.77]Heal disease.
[192:33.49]I don't have a medicinal potion, so... Although that kind of scares me that that's an option.
[192:40.17]Far.
[192:40.65]See the future.
[192:43.30]We're gonna see the future.
[192:46.60]You settle into a sitting position by the roots of a tree and take out the orb of crystal.
[192:51.18]You bind the stars into a pattern around you and suddenly you find yourself somewhere quite new.
[192:55.50]You are overcome by a vision of your future.
[192:58.44]You stand in a clearing halfway up a mountainside.
[193:01.93]In the middle of that clearing is a tombstone.
[193:04.13]You stand beside it with a vial of water in your hand.
[193:07.13]What is happening?
[193:14.83]um wait a minute the future are we currently in the past right now we are so in the future I have to pour water down on where am I halfway up the mountainside pour the water
[193:38.88]Seal the deal.
[193:39.34]Thanks for 500 bits.
[193:40.26]Had a terrible day.
[193:40.99]Thanks for making it better.
[193:42.49]Love you, Jerma.
[193:43.89]Oh, thanks, Seal.
[193:45.61]Hope your day gets better as the time goes on.
[193:47.89]Appreciate it, man.
[193:49.67]Also, the spirit of 2277 subscribed.
[193:51.99]Errolis with 101 bits.
[193:53.92]Minkfer with 100 bits.
[193:55.40]Ready and moist.
[193:56.52]Fahrenheit 616.
[193:57.54]Thanks for subbing both of you guys.
[193:58.74]Thanks to Gioro for the 100 bits.
[194:01.46]And that's the guys that came in.
[194:03.70]The guys and gals that came in.
[194:05.46]I'm going to pour the water.
[194:08.34]You pour the water into the Earth and it seeps down through the soil.
[194:12.12]There is a magic in the air.
[194:13.42]Suddenly something punches the Earth below where you stand.
[194:20.48]I'm gonna wait.
[194:22.57]Pour a 40 for flanker.
[194:24.57]I'm waiting.
[194:26.91]You wait and a moment later, a skeletal hand erupts through the soil and grabs you around the ankle.
[194:31.69]Something is hauling itself up from the ground using your leg for purchase.
[194:35.48]The vision fades.
[194:37.00]Clouds begin to tumble across the darkening sky.
[194:42.08]Okay.
[194:44.90]What else can I do in here?
[194:54.95]Ca- depression.
[195:00.23]It's either depression, heal disease, or see the future.
[195:11.54]Should I cast depression?
[195:16.28]I'm going for it.
[195:19.84]Sap.
[195:22.68]You craft a spell and immediately feel yourself losing your energy and drive with no other creatures nearby.
[195:26.96]The magic is turned on you.
[195:34.14]Fucking wait.
[195:34.74]This seems like a good dry safe place to sleep.
[195:36.56]Just sit down You pass the time in quiet meditation outside night falls and the stars come out dimly visible above the canopy It's it really wants me to cast a fucking spell But I only have these options what does he what are the other fucking options I
[196:02.40]Like, heal disease.
[196:03.76]It so desperately wants me to heal disease.
[196:05.97]Because these other options are terrible.
[196:13.39]Just go to bed.
[196:16.11]I've eaten well.
[196:16.79]Close my eyes.
[196:18.44]You are unharmed here and you do not dream.
[196:22.50]You found nothing.
[196:26.50]You are awoken in the morning by sunshine sneaking through the tangled branches outside the hut.
[196:31.01]But you're not alone.
[196:33.19]Hello, whispers the girl crouching beside you.
[196:35.97]She's holding out a bowl.
[196:38.21]I thought you'd like something to eat.
[196:41.45]Pinch myself.
[196:43.35]Sit up.
[196:44.47]You sit up slowly.
[196:45.37]The girl smiles nervously.
[196:47.64]You've been asleep for some time.
[196:51.76]Not long enough.
[196:53.32]Are you a ghost?
[196:54.94]Who are you?
[196:56.57]I live here.
[196:57.59]This is my home.
[196:58.93]She puts her bowl down on the floor beside you.
[197:00.86]It seems to contain some kind of gray gruel.
[197:05.94]What is that?
[197:07.44]It's munch flax and Snattercat's milk, with a few berries for flavor.
[197:11.86]It's pretty disgusting, but it's food.
[197:16.22]You've milked a Snattercat?
[197:20.10]When they're asleep, they're really asleep.
[197:23.56]Fucking liar.
[197:24.57]You're a liar.
[197:25.79]She shrugs, but you have visibly wounded her feelings.
[197:31.19]Don't eat it if you think I'm a liar.
[197:37.82]I'll have some.
[197:38.40]Fine.
[197:40.84]You take a cautious mouthful with your fingers.
[197:43.60]It is thick, sour, and foul.
[197:48.50]Eat some more.
[197:50.01]But it is food, all the same.
[197:52.30]After a few more mouthfuls, you begin to grow accustomed to the taste.
[197:56.04]I don't like it either.
[197:58.00]Watching your face, she admits.
[197:59.96]A moment later, she has vanished.
[198:04.52]Where are you?
[198:06.40]Right here, comes the reply, as though from your elbow, though there is no one there.
[198:14.05]You get up thinking to search the corners of the room, though there's nothing there that could provide anywhere to hide.
[198:18.87]Then suddenly the girl is in front of you again, a little wide-eyed.
[198:22.41]What's the matter?
[198:23.67]She asks.
[198:26.00]You vanished.
[198:28.24]I did?
[198:29.20]She runs her finger around the inside of the bowl, scooping up what's left.
[198:35.52]Oh shit, does she know I took that?
[198:42.11]Should I give her back the holy water?
[198:45.82]You vanished from sight, the girl shrugs.
[198:48.70]I don't know what you're talking about.
[198:50.40]The light was behind me, that's all.
[198:52.30]For a moment, she vanishes again, then reappears.
[198:55.88]You did it again.
[198:58.64]She shakes her head.
[199:00.08]I just closed my eyes for a moment.
[199:01.82]I'm still waking up.
[199:12.31]Here, you can have it back.
[199:13.47]I found this.
[199:14.89]Handing back the vial of holy water.
[199:17.71]I thought this hut was empty, so I took it.
[199:20.77]It's just water.
[199:22.19]You can keep it.
[199:26.53]Where are you from?
[199:28.05]You weren't born in the forest, surely?
[199:30.30]She shakes her head.
[199:31.88]I was born in Timpang.
[199:33.52]There used to be a bridge, but it's gone now.
[199:36.16]I suppose whoever destroyed my city destroyed it, too.
[199:39.93]I was on that bridge.
[199:40.65]I was on that bridge.
[199:41.15]It's a cool bridge.
[199:42.67]It comes and goes.
[199:43.91]Comes and goes.
[199:44.91]I don't know about you, but I don't want to walk across a bridge that comes and goes.
[199:50.63]The girl steps away from the door and then once again disappears from view.
[199:53.77]This time she reappears much faster.
[199:56.19]It is clear from her manner that she does not notice it happening.
[200:00.57]You keep turning invisible.
[200:02.97]I might have blinked.
[200:04.51]Picking up the bowl, she drains the last few dregs of Snattercat milk from it.
[200:10.13]Take her to Fenestra.
[200:13.09]Oh!
[200:14.47]Yeah.
[200:15.82]I know someone that could help you, you tell the girl.
[200:18.06]A sorceress who lives close by.
[200:19.44]She could look after you, I'm sure.
[200:22.16]I don't need looking after.
[200:23.12]I'm not a child.
[200:25.00]The child replies sharply, but then her tone softens.
[200:29.18]Still, I wouldn't mind some company.
[200:31.24]Is she safe, this sorceress?
[200:35.34]Yes.
[200:36.86]Sounds boring, but a little bit of boring might make a nice change.
[200:41.00]She points to the doorway.
[200:42.24]Lead the way.
[200:43.46]You head for the door.
[200:47.70]Outside.
[200:50.51]You step outside, thorn branches catching on your cloak, and then you turn to help the girl through, but she has vanished again.
[200:57.87]You call for her, but she does not reappear.
[201:01.05]Are you here?
[201:03.34]There is nothing but silence.
[201:04.88]The overgrown hut is quite empty.
[201:07.59]Then a moment later, she is at your side once more, breathless with excitement over something.
[201:12.13]You really can't see me.
[201:13.71]I closed my eyes and crept up on you, and you couldn't see me.
[201:16.21]You thought I disappeared.
[201:17.21]I thought you were gone.
[201:21.67]I was right in front of you waving like this.
[201:23.82]She waves her hands in front of your nose, somewhat annoyingly.
[201:26.98]Then she glances away into the trees.
[201:29.48]So which way are we going?
[201:31.56]You leave the hut behind.
[201:35.84]Let's go.
[201:39.62]The path winds torturously through the forest.
[201:41.88]A few clouds hurry across the sky.
[201:44.34]If we're going to travel together, you should know my name.
[201:47.23]I'm Eliza.
[201:48.01]Wait, hold on.
[201:55.63]This girl's fucking dead.
[201:58.89]I had guessed.
[202:00.28]Oh, she thinks for that about for a moment.
[202:02.90]But I can't guess your name.
[202:06.10]I'm the Annalander.
[202:07.86]Her eyes open wide and she stops where she stands.
[202:11.04]You're the Annalander?
[202:13.50]Oh, fuck.
[202:14.02]What have I done?
[202:15.86]Draw my sword.
[202:17.97]You've heard of me?
[202:19.17]She is standing a pace away from you now.
[202:22.49]I heard someone whispering your name in the trees.
[202:25.01]It said it was going to kill you.
[202:30.31]Dude, you tried to kill this woman you were leading this girl to.
[202:32.65]Just a heads up, she might not be too happy about this.
[202:35.67]Was it a serpent?
[202:37.35]No, a figure in black.
[202:40.03]What figure?
[202:41.39]I don't know.
[202:42.89]I'll call you Frit, I think.
[202:46.02]Her voice trails off thoughtfully.
[202:49.14]Someone back home?
[202:52.28]It's an ancient word.
[202:53.24]It means ghost.
[202:55.12]With that, she takes your hand and walks onwards with you.
[202:58.15]This is an open place, not somewhere to wait.
[203:00.85]This is a dangerous place.
[203:03.07]The witch who lives here is a serpent in disguise.
[203:08.80]Is that so?
[203:11.04]She's evil.
[203:13.76]Okay, I got a companion.
[203:16.64]I got a companion.
[203:17.26]We're going to take on this fucking serpent bitch.
[203:20.61]You go over and open the door.
[203:22.41]Don't, this is Eliza.
[203:24.59]She'll come for us.
[203:27.87]I'll protect you, you tell her, stepping a short way into the darkness.
[203:31.35]But the girl is not convinced.
[203:33.29]You say you can't see me when I close my eyes.
[203:35.47]Is that right?
[203:38.46]Yes.
[203:40.30]You see Eliza lower her eyelids, and then she disappears smoothly and completely from view.
[203:44.40]The forest path is quite silent.
[203:47.32]Open your eyes, you insist.
[203:48.89]We should not waste time.
[203:50.41]Nothing happens if you leave, shiver in the breeze.
[203:54.13]Don't play fucking games with me.
[203:56.67]But even as you speak, you sense you are alone.
[203:59.43]There is no sound, no sense of presence.
[204:02.09]The girl has simply disappeared somewhere between the trees.
[204:05.41]You fall quiet for a moment, but hear nothing.
[204:07.51]It seems she is gone.
[204:09.75]There is a movement from inside the hill, and the elf witch appears.
[204:15.53]You?
[204:16.50]What do you want?
[204:19.52]I brought someone to meet you.
[204:21.74]She leans outside the door and looks this way, and that went wrong, did it?
[204:28.31]She's still here, I think.
[204:30.95]The elf shakes her head.
[204:31.97]I have no time for traps.
[204:34.50]She moves to close the door.
[204:37.20]You let Fenestra close the door and step away from the hill.
[204:39.82]From somewhere nearby, you hear a tapping noise.
[204:42.30]Then it is gone.
[204:48.16]If that's a fucking serpent, then who's the serpent?
[204:58.49]Sounds like your Tinder.
[205:05.04]Did I just like fucking botch that whole thing?
[205:07.48]I'm going back to her house.
[205:14.63]The path leads away in the forest.
[205:15.57]I'm going back in the house.
[205:16.19]I'm going to be like, what the fuck are you doing?
[205:24.39]There's no sign of the girl you met here earlier.
[205:27.38]Fuck.
[205:33.07]That girl hissed at me.
[205:36.85]I got a hiss stat.
[205:39.14]That girl must... They're probably both serpents.
[205:43.60]Or maybe there's like good serpents.
[205:47.00]That was a loud ass bird.
[205:48.36]Did you hear that?
[205:53.03]Botched.
[205:59.41]Alright, we're at 820.
[206:00.85]We are at 820.
[206:03.79]Prepare for the doom that is Comcast turning off my upload.
[206:10.27]It is imminent.
[206:14.36]You trace what might be a path.
[206:16.26]It might be an old river.
[206:18.22]Through the trees of the forest, the sun has reached its highest point now.
[206:21.46]The hot sun is shaded by all the trees around.
[206:23.80]A large ancient tree has fallen down across the path here.
[206:29.36]I'm going to climb.
[206:29.92]Let's get a better view.
[206:32.06]You clamber up onto the trunk and look off into the distance of the trees.
[206:35.60]To the east, the mountains rise tall and cold, and a gleaming to the south suggests a pool of water.
[206:41.41]A soft plop echoes from the tree trunk.
[206:48.65]You missed out on a serpent threesome.
[206:51.18]Oh, Jesus.
[206:56.68]Investigate the sound.
[206:59.16]You leave your pack on the tree trunk and move carefully along its length, eyes peeled for what it was making the noise.
[207:05.43]Suddenly, of its own accord, your pack topples from the trunk and onto the ground.
[207:09.93]Huh?
[207:13.76]I'm gonna watch.
[207:17.24]You wait and watch a moment.
[207:18.74]The pack suddenly compresses as though a great invisible hand was pressing down on it.
[207:24.96]Then you hear a growl close at hand and coming closer.
[207:30.24]My pack is... I don't understand what's going on.
[207:41.42]Yep.
[207:42.22]Talk with animals.
[207:43.64]It's definitely like a fucking beetle bear.
[207:46.56]Yep.
[207:50.06]Pulling out the green wig you put it on and cast the spell, the faint growls in the trees slowly begin to slur, turning into distinct words.
[207:57.97]The creature appears to be talking to itself.
[208:01.23]Left side open.
[208:02.87]Stay down.
[208:04.17]Stay low.
[208:06.94]What are you?
[208:07.94]You demand fiercely.
[208:10.24]It wants to know what I am.
[208:11.78]It wants to know what it eats it.
[208:14.72]It wants to know what I am.
[208:17.71]Leave or I will skin you, you declare boldly.
[208:20.46]This is your only warning.
[208:22.22]The creature seems to consider for a quiet moment.
[208:24.52]Then it launches itself forward.
[208:26.64]Suddenly, long gashes appear on your arm as claws that you cannot see seem to rake your flesh.
[208:31.36]For a moment, you feel hot breath on your cheek.
[208:33.20]Then it's gone.
[208:35.24]It's Comcast.
[208:39.29]Left side open.
[208:40.63]Stay down.
[208:41.35]Stay low.
[208:44.73]Fuck, you draw your broadsword, but suddenly there's blood running down your arm.
[208:47.37]Long gashes like claws have appeared.
[208:51.71]Long gashes like claws have appeared, and you almost drop your blade.
[208:55.23]Spin with the sword.
[208:56.17]Just do a fucking blade storm.
[208:58.40]You spin with the sword, outstretched, hoping to catch whatever attacked you, but the sword merely whistles through the empty air, and then something charges your stomach, knocking you flat on the ground.
[209:06.46]Stay down.
[209:07.48]You scramble back, but there's still nothing to be seen.
[209:10.62]Strike down hard.
[209:12.54]You slash down into the grass and hit something.
[209:15.04]Blood seems to spring onto the blade and there is a terrible animal scream.
[209:19.69]Slash again.
[209:20.77]You slash down again and the blow makes the creature scream.
[209:23.37]For just a moment, it materializes in front of you.
[209:26.39]A furry beast about the size of a large dog with a snub snouth and large razor sharp teeth.
[209:32.96]It is watching you intently.
[209:34.96]Charge it!
[209:36.14]You rush forward.
[209:37.28]The creature closes its eyes, abruptly vanishing from your sight.
[209:39.84]Then, presumably, it steps sideways, avoiding your blow and slashing painfully at your leg.
[209:45.53]Slip away.
[209:54.47]Snuff.
[210:00.95]Snuff, snuff.
[210:09.39]pick up on that.
[210:10.49]What is a snouth?
[210:12.69]Oh, it must have been a Snattercat.
[210:17.49]I got a new clue.
[210:19.12]He's gonna let me leave, apparently.
[210:22.02]What's the new clue?
[210:25.90]That bird!
[210:26.48]Shut the fuck up!
[210:28.28]Snattercats are invisible!
[210:34.70]That lady was a Snattercat.
[210:40.81]That lady is a Snattercat.
[210:45.59]They are invisible when they close their eyes.
[210:47.13]That lady was closing her eyes and going invisible.
[210:50.82]It was a Snattercat all along.
[210:52.08]So what was the point of all that?
[210:59.68]She fed you her own milk.
[211:11.37]Okay.
[211:14.20]Okie dokie.
[211:17.64]That's pretty fucked up.
[211:26.10]Things move in the canopy all around you.
[211:28.18]That afternoon heat makes the air damp.
[211:30.72]The forest path curves past the shore of a deep, flat pool.
[211:33.68]I remember the gourd.
[211:38.78]I'm going to fill the gourd with water.
[211:42.08]Forage for some food.
[211:43.76]You take a moment to forage through the nearby bushes for edible-looking plants.
[211:46.50]You find a couple of mushrooms and a handful of nuts.
[211:52.70]Uh... Try a mushroom.
[211:56.06]You tear off one corner of the mushroom and put one onto your tongue.
[211:58.74]It tastes well enough.
[212:03.55]Eat some more.
[212:05.63]You stuff the rest of the mushroom into your mouth.
[212:08.01]A moment later you find the corners of your vision are popping and discoloring.
[212:11.69]It must be tiredness.
[212:16.17]Drink some water.
[212:17.63]You go to drink some water and collapse face down in the pool.
[212:24.37]You feel unable to push yourself upright.
[212:26.69]Strange things happen as you begin to drown.
[212:33.15]Sparkling lights.
[212:35.64]A fat worm made of firecrackers seems to be crawling out of one of your eyes and crossing the bridge of your nose into the other eye.
[212:43.07]It leaves a slime trail of pink fire in its wake.
[212:46.55]But that's not all.
[212:48.15]Bangs and crashes, explosions are going off close by your ears, making you jump from side to side.
[212:53.62]The explosions match the rhythm of your heartbeat almost, but not quite precisely.
[212:58.14]You remember your mother, but she appears to have been a goldfish.
[213:02.46]Fluttering Darkness.
[213:04.47]Strange shadowy creatures, bats perhaps, have removed the top of your head.
[213:09.02]One by one they take out your memories, polish them and organize them into a better pattern within your skull.
[213:14.66]The dreams... I don't know that word.
[213:17.21]Let's just say the dreams collide.
[213:19.13]The world seems to disappear, replaced by a vision.
[213:22.14]a ring of tall, shadowy stones and a desolate waste.
[213:25.46]You stand at their center, holding above your head a long yellow feather taken from some colossal bird.
[213:32.38]You are casting a spell of curious power.
[213:34.23]Let's see what happens.
[213:36.83]The spell begins to take hold and the feather erupts into flame as though you hold a fiery sword.
[213:43.05]The fire reaches down your arm and into your bones and you feel yourself swelling with great strength.
[213:47.70]The vision fades.
[213:48.88]The evening's drawing on.
[213:49.76]It will be dark soon.
[213:52.11]Did I learn a new spell?
[213:52.75]What did I just learn?
[214:23.39]fire sword?
[214:25.44]Was that like trying to give me like a vision of what I need to do or something?
[214:34.30]The water extends away to the southeast towards the dark shadows of the next range of mountains.
[214:39.79]It's not quite a lake, but a large pool.
[214:43.15]A little too large for a pool, and who knows how deep it is.
[214:46.39]On the far side, you see another stone tower.
[214:52.22]Test the water.
[214:54.35]The water must be freezing cold, but if you had to swim, you could probably survive it.
[215:03.91]What else can I do?
[215:04.45]Oh, I can do... Zen.
[215:10.98]I don't have the... Zip.
[215:13.06]I wish I could do Zip.
[215:15.60]Teleportation seems to be very useful.
[215:20.16]It was just a bad trip.
[215:24.37]See the future.
[215:25.01]I don't really want to see the future right now.
[215:26.35]I don't care.
[215:32.37]Safe passage.
[215:35.93]Reaching up to the stars, you create the magic and steady voice begins to speak to you.
[215:39.25]The voice tells you calmly that the water is too deep to walk through, but could be safely swum.
[215:47.55]Let's go.
[215:48.36]You stride down to the edge of the water, take a deep breath and dive in.
[215:53.24]Look at this icon.
[215:57.76]Ah, alright, let's swim across.
[216:03.79]You swim across the water and pull yourself up on the other shore.
[216:06.87]The sun is almost set and the sky has turned a deep purple.
[216:09.43]Soon it will be dark.
[216:11.45]Nestled in a curve of the eastern cliffs is a stone tower.
[216:14.39]It is heavily overgrown with thorny branches and its base is almost obscured by shrubs and tangled weeds.
[216:19.85]Hey, look at this, it's one of those towers.
[216:22.69]You know what that means.
[216:23.79]More time traveling.
[216:31.97]Cut through the branches.
[216:34.48]You heft your hewing axe and cleave quickly through the branches that surround the base of the tower.
[216:39.30]The axe's keen edge makes short work of the thorns and you have soon cut a path to the tower's door.
[216:44.34]Bleh.
[216:44.96]Bleh.
[216:46.28]That was a terrible bleh.
[216:47.08]I'll do it again.
[216:48.34]Bleh.
[216:50.29]Thanks a lot, Elroy.
[216:51.59]Thank you, Digital Tilt.
[216:53.55]Both of you guys for subscribing.
[216:54.47]Thank you, Saint615.
[216:56.21]612.
[216:57.12]How did I say that as a five?
[216:59.14]Thank you, Donk, for the 100 bits.
[217:03.36]Thank you for your sub, too.
[217:05.06]Donkles.
[217:06.15]Donk LZ.
[217:09.38]D. Kovsky.
[217:10.78]D. Kozersky.
[217:13.07]D. Kozersky.
[217:14.31]Thanks for three months, man.
[217:16.17]What happened to the Lorag?
[217:17.47]He was sucked out of our body.
[217:19.73]We got rid of him.
[217:20.95]He tried to trick us and we got rid of him.
[217:24.28]Thanks, Minkfur for the 100 bits.
[217:25.34]Thank you.
[217:25.66]No soup for you, Minkfur again with 100 bits.
[217:27.74]You guys are coming in like... I've seen a couple of the same names drop a lot of money.
[217:34.84]I mean, we've seen some of the big, like, 100 fucking bucks, 300 bucks.
[217:39.64]But there's a couple of you guys in this chat that are dropping a dollar a lot.
[217:44.54]So that adds up.
[217:48.09]That does add up.
[217:49.33]So thank you for that, guys.
[217:51.91]Alright.
[217:52.63]Let's make a move.
[217:53.27]Let's go up and put the jewel in here.
[217:59.75]Step into the tower, and the tower is... This looks a little different.
[218:04.49]You step into the dark interior of the tower.
[218:07.37]Shadows loom from all sides, and though you can see nothing, there is the sense that something dominates the space.
[218:15.54]Something lives in here.
[218:18.60]Wait for my eyes to adjust.
[218:21.08]You hold back, waiting for your eyes to adjust.
[218:22.84]Slowly, details filter in.
[218:26.16]Dala.
[218:27.34]Thanks, Squidward.
[218:28.50]Why do I keep calling you Squidward?
[218:29.71]I don't know.
[218:31.15]You're standing at the base of a gigantic tree by the girth that must be at least 500 years old.
[218:36.41]A wooden staircase winds around the trunk and disappears into the canopy.
[218:43.70]Dara Bills.
[218:45.26]Thank you, Mink.
[218:47.11]Dollabills.
[218:48.37]The tree is wider than your outstretched arms and has thick branches and leaves despite the dark.
[218:53.59]Somewhere up above you spy a metallic glint.
[218:55.74]Time to explore.
[218:59.54]This one's like overgrown by trees.
[219:02.12]Does that mean I can't turn it?
[219:03.40]I wonder if it's stuck there.
[219:09.24]You climb the spiraling wooden stairs, picking your way through and over branches.
[219:12.79]Someone has carved something into the bark of the tree here.
[219:18.72]Thanks, Croucher.
[219:19.80]Look at the carving.
[219:22.38]New spell.
[219:24.67]You regard the carving with some interest.
[219:26.67]It is a triangle formed from three stars, a spell.
[219:30.59]Using your spell book as a reference, you match the stars in the carving to those you know until you have the spell memorized.
[219:36.24]This is the SSS spell.
[219:39.14]Though from what you can make out of its alignment, it would need a focus to work, a ring most likely, with a curious coiled fashion, snake-like.
[219:48.64]The SSS spell has been recorded in your spell book.
[219:51.98]Cool?
[219:53.17]The staircase passes through a split in the trunk before it reaches the top.
[219:56.90]The top.
[220:00.32]You emerge onto a stone walkway built in a ring that allows the tree to grow through.
[220:04.76]Resting in its branches is the brass contraption that we've all seen before.
[220:09.18]Its gears and bearing carefully enmeshed between the limbs of the trees.
[220:13.22]As the leaves gust back and forth, something else brass glints from within.
[220:18.16]Look at the brass glint.
[220:20.56]You reach out to bend in the branch from which the gleam is coming.
[220:23.62]It is a ring, slipped over the tip of the branch.
[220:26.70]The wood has grown into the metal somewhat, suggesting the ring was placed here when the tree was somewhat younger.
[220:34.02]You stand on tiptoes to peer at the ring.
[220:36.44]It has some kind of marking, but you cannot quite make it out.
[220:41.10]Free ring?
[220:43.18]Free ring.
[220:45.78]I'll take it.
[220:47.49]You try to work the ring back up the branch, but it is too firmly ingrown and you cannot get it to move at all.
[220:57.27]Break it.
[220:58.87]The wood is still alive, so breaking it is hard work, but in the end the branch gives, snapping violently in two.
[221:04.76]The ring pings off the end and disappears into the nearby trees.
[221:10.34]Fuck, I gotta go get that, don't I?
[221:14.00]Well, activate the beacon.
[221:16.59]you push it and you adjust the beam so now I can technically make the bridge complete I can put this over on the lake down this way over here
[221:45.61]That's where the water serpent is.
[221:47.47]I have the oil now.
[221:49.67]That's like a whole town.
[221:52.11]Yeah.
[221:53.05]So the water serpent's only in the present.
[221:54.60]He's not in the past.
[222:01.82]I'm going to put it on the bridge.
[222:03.52]I want to get down there and fight the water serpent.
[222:05.50]I have the oil.
[222:06.06]Might as well do it, right?
[222:06.78]I'm going to do this and teleport to the other one.
[222:11.14]Right there.
[222:16.79]Touch the blue crystal.
[222:18.89]Let's go across the bridge.
[222:22.23]Shit.
[222:22.99]I need to move this then.
[222:23.99]No, which one?
[222:24.39]Yeah.
[222:25.07]This one, right?
[222:31.15]Adjust the beam.
[222:35.63]There we go.
[222:37.03]We're going to go across the bridge and we're going to kill the fucking water serpent.
[222:45.91]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[222:50.25]I, uh... I want the ring.
[222:57.62]Climb down.
[222:58.62]It fell into the trees, it said over here.
[223:00.04]I'm gonna go get it.
[223:06.91]Look for the ring.
[223:09.55]The undergrowth here is quite thick, and despite thrashing at the bushes, you cannot see any hint of the ring that fell from the tower.
[223:16.36]It may not have even fallen this close to the tower base, so it is most likely at the bottom of the pool by now.
[223:21.04]Are you serious?
[223:30.26]Sense ring.
[223:34.94]I'm fucking diving into the water then.
[223:43.83]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[223:44.65]Back into the pool.
[223:45.57]Cross the pool.
[223:48.35]Can I, like, not dive into this?
[223:49.59]Oh, shit.
[223:50.51]No.
[223:55.03]Fuck.
[223:56.21]I gotta, like... It's, like, in the way.
[224:02.81]No, I gotta move the beacon again.
[224:08.25]Hold on.
[224:13.38]Move the beacon so I can get in the pool.
[224:21.35]Aim it this way for a second.
[224:23.97]Just fire it through somebody's fucking bedroom window.
[224:26.11]Alright.
[224:35.42]To the pool.
[224:35.80]Let's get the ring that fell in the damn pool.
[224:41.42]Cross the pool!
[224:44.07]Alright.
[224:44.77]Fuck, did I fall asleep in the pool?
[224:49.13]I'm not actually, like, asleep.
[224:50.21]Okay.
[224:53.00]Alright.
[224:53.38]You have no choice but to swim.
[224:55.26]The water is cold, and by the time you reach the other side, you are bedraggled.
[224:58.22]The freezing water leaves you shivering.
[225:00.66]I didn't even sleep.
[225:01.42]The water of the pool laps gently at the dirt shore, the water shimmering dully in the dark.
[225:05.90]Okay, look into the water.
[225:10.39]You peer down into the black water that reflects the stars above and the sickle-like moon in your own haggard face.
[225:17.51]What?
[225:26.38]That took me a whole day?
[225:27.78]How long was I staring into the water for?
[225:32.36]I was looking at that water for a whole day.
[225:40.33]What the hell?
[225:42.93]Well, the ring is apparently gone.
[225:53.10]Phew, what a day.
[225:55.12]Yeah, I looked at water for like 16 hours.
[225:59.08]Oh, bye ring.
[226:05.83]Ring is gone.
[226:11.65]Whatever.
[226:17.15]I'll come back and get it later if I can get it.
[226:21.15]Let's move the beam.
[226:26.59]Back to bed.
[226:27.19]Yeah, it's back to bed all over again.
[226:30.47]Right there.
[226:33.93]Touch the blue crystal and let's teleport to here.
[226:37.42]And get across that gosh darn bridge.
[226:43.70]Do Zen?
[226:44.32]I don't have the item for Zen, I don't believe.
[226:48.80]I don't think I have the item for Zen.
[226:50.33]I need like a medallion for it.
[226:54.33]I don't have it.
[227:01.03]Alright.
[227:04.12]Oh, this way.
[227:07.96]Oh gosh, heck darn it.
[227:10.83]You came across a steep funnel on the surface.
[227:12.33]This is where the Baadu Beetle attacked you.
[227:14.49]And you made him dance vigorously.
[227:23.56]Okay, you walk underneath the spraying prayer flags once more.
[227:27.80]Keep going.
[227:28.58]Let's just get across that bridge.
[227:32.68]Hopefully this guy's not going to come out again.
[227:37.70]Mountaintop is empty.
[227:38.46]There's no sign of Vankus.
[227:41.48]Cross the bridge.
[227:47.85]You step onto the bridge, the sun is sinking.
[227:53.15]This is kind of freaking me out because I keep seeing that.
[227:56.69]Go now.
[227:56.99]Go, go, go, go, go.
[228:00.09]The sun is all but gone.
[228:00.95]It will be night soon.
[228:02.29]You make your way under the stones of the bridge, which will form a broad, solid path below you.
[228:05.43]A thick marsh spreads north and south between the lines.
[228:08.77]Go.
[228:09.49]Do not waste any time.
[228:11.70]Not climbing down.
[228:12.56]We know what happens when I do that shit.
[228:15.36]It's not good.
[228:17.70]Alright.
[228:19.11]You continue along the soaring bridge.
[228:21.27]Darkness closes in.
[228:22.87]You should try to find a suitable spot to sleep, especially after walking all day without food.
[228:27.91]There are no handrails here.
[228:29.70]Sitting by the sheer drop at the edge of the road is a starving-looking man with legs folded beneath him and head bowed to the stone.
[228:37.88]He is perhaps asleep or drunk or dead.
[228:44.62]Oh, wake him.
[228:48.38]You touch him on the shoulder and he sits up sharply.
[228:51.76]Greetings and well met, he declares.
[228:54.22]Spare a coin?
[228:55.70]He slides a palm up.
[228:57.16]Perhaps he does not have the energy to lift it across the stone.
[229:03.38]What are you going to spend it on?
[229:05.64]You ask nothing his red-rimmed eyes and two-aged skin.
[229:10.28]That's my business, isn't it?
[229:12.73]I have to live, don't I?
[229:15.19]Take a coin.
[229:15.89]Fine.
[229:16.61]You hand him a gold coin with a nod.
[229:17.79]Use it wisely, you tell him.
[229:19.73]Thank you, stranger.
[229:23.15]What do you know about the serpents?
[229:25.69]You open your mouth, preparing to ask the man for information in return for your gold, but the words fail when the beggar holds your gold coin out over the side of the bridge and lets it go.
[229:35.12]It twinkles as it sails out of sight.
[229:41.34]You hand him another coin to replace the first, and he tosses that one off the bridge as well.
[229:46.23]Isn't falling wonderful?
[229:50.32]That was most ungrateful.
[229:52.84]Oh, I'm most grateful.
[229:54.86]I've dropped all my coins already, so I haven't been able to watch one fall in too long.
[230:00.94]Now give me another coin or push off.
[230:05.63]Give me another coin.
[230:06.73]You end up a third coin.
[230:08.11]He tosses it off the bridge and it sinks into a deep meditative silence.
[230:13.09]You leave the man and move along the bridge.
[230:18.43]Where is my throw this guy over the bridge?
[230:24.04]Make him fall if he likes it so much.
[230:30.00]You continue... What the fuck was the point of that?
[230:34.06]You continue across the bridge, which is becoming patchy and filled with holes.
[230:37.90]Just before you reach the far side, it vanishes completely, leaving a three-stride gap between where you stand and the edge of the next mountain.
[230:45.29]Jump.
[230:46.49]Taking your life in your hands, you take a few steps back and then run and jump.
[230:50.11]Do I land?
[230:51.13]I hope so.
[230:52.79]You hit the far mountainside roughly, but thankfully without falling to your death.
[230:57.53]You stand on a dry plateau on top of a mountain.
[231:00.27]It seems impossible now to have reached such a place as the only path is set of broken steps from the east and the bridges disappeared again completely.
[231:09.78]Let's move.
[231:12.52]Thanks a lot, Phoenix.
[231:13.92]Thank you, Rooster.
[231:15.62]Thank you, Crocher, Minkfur, and Squidward.
[231:18.74]Also, thank you to Elroy for this description.
[231:21.56]Welcome, guys.
[231:26.99]Alright, what's down here?
[231:28.52]There's the water serpent.
[231:29.70]I have the oil.
[231:31.74]He's just dead.
[231:33.04]Going right for him.
[231:36.90]You make your way down the mountainside slowly, being careful with your footing on the scree.
[231:44.50]This is now the dead of night.
[231:46.41]The road down the slope passes a small stone house.
[231:49.37]The aged wooden door stands a crack ajar.
[231:55.81]Look inside.
[231:57.50]You peer inside the house.
[231:58.85]It is dark inside, but you can make out furniture coated by layers of dust.
[232:03.21]It seems that this place is no ruin, but it has clearly been uninhabited for some time.
[232:10.04]I'm going right in.
[232:11.88]The door creaks its old-born hinges as you push it open.
[232:15.42]Let's go.
[232:18.25]The inside of the hut is simple, but as you saw, well kept.
[232:21.97]In the center of the room is a table with one wooden stool, and in one corner is a straw mattress cot.
[232:28.47]A cauldron sits in a hearth with a roasting spit above it.
[232:32.63]By the far wall is a sculling boat.
[232:37.13]Look at the cauldron.
[232:39.13]You peer into the cauldron, but if there was ever anything edible inside, it has long since turned to dust.
[232:43.89]The pot is quite empty.
[232:46.51]Look under the table.
[232:50.21]Under the table.
[232:51.81]You peer under the table, looking for trapdoors or long-lost items, but there's nothing of interest.
[232:57.66]Look at the boat.
[232:59.28]It is clear that the boat is an ornament, or else the owner intended to repair it but made no progress.
[233:04.06]It has several planks missing, no paint, and woodworm has been burrowing constellations into its side.
[233:12.12]But once it must have been a serviceable coracle.
[233:16.69]Yeah, thank you.
[233:17.79]Jervis Pet Frog.
[233:18.54]There's my frog.
[233:19.66]Yeah, just subscribe.
[233:20.50]Thanks a lot, dude.
[233:21.70]And NoNameBob.
[233:22.44]Thanks for the bits.
[233:23.48]Thanks for the bits, dude.
[233:26.06]You push the door to... You push the door to and stretch out gracefully on the low cot.
[233:32.17]You have not yet eaten today, but your pack is empty and you cannot satisfy your belly.
[233:36.73]You close your eyes.
[233:37.93]You are very tired.
[233:39.19]You do not have a damn dream.
[233:42.18]Day 14.
[233:45.26]Let's kill the water serpent.
[233:48.22]Wait, there's a skeleton here?
[233:50.34]Since when is there a skeleton?
[233:53.82]You get to your feet and stretch.
[233:55.12]Warm sunshine falls through the open south window of the house, making dust sparkle as it floats past.
[234:00.98]It is clear there is nothing here.
[234:02.84]You turn to go, and that is when you see the skeleton tied to the wall above the doorframe.
[234:10.98]Let's take a look.
[234:13.14]You stare up at it.
[234:14.58]The figure must have been a big man once.
[234:17.04]He has wide leg bones now strapped with leather through iron pins hammered into stone, and his shoulders are broad and stocky.
[234:24.50]Now attached to hooks that still bear the trace of blood, his empty skull hangs low, sockets staring at the floor.
[234:32.40]Aside from the gruesome nature, there is something very strange about it all.
[234:38.81]Oh, here's the fan art posting.
[234:39.81]It's mainly so you can chat.
[234:41.21]Oh, here, let's take a look.
[234:42.63]Let's take a look at the fan art.
[234:43.69]I'm gonna open it.
[234:54.69]Twitter.com.
[235:00.27]Cass's app.
[235:05.79]That's fucking awesome.
[235:09.16]I like how, like, how good I look.
[235:11.76]Wow, like, I don't, I don't, I look, like, way shittier than that in real life.
[235:18.56]Oh, thanks, that's awesome.
[235:20.92]Cash zap.
[235:23.99]Thank you for the fan art, that's fucking cool.
[235:27.61]Dragon breath, 75.
[235:32.67]Pull one out.
[235:34.87]Alright, aside from the gruesome nature, there's something very strange about it all.
[235:37.96]He's very odd.
[235:40.32]Am I going to try to talk to a skeleton?
[235:42.32]Wait, what?
[235:44.88]Thanks for getting me hooked.
[235:46.40]I just got through the first part on mobile.
[235:48.60]Oh, you're very welcome, Stoked Gamer.
[235:54.00]You're very, very welcome.
[235:54.90]Show?
[235:55.21]I don't have monitor capture set up.
[235:59.07]Hold on.
[236:02.65]Yeah, just click that link.
[236:04.13]It's right there.
[236:04.95]It's going to take me at least three or four minutes to set up monitor capture.
[236:11.25]And I'm running on empty oil right now because it's almost 9 o'clock and the stream is still up.
[236:15.99]So I'm going to try to get as much out of this stream as I can.
[236:20.07]Every second counts.
[236:25.95]If I said your body was beautiful, would you hold it against me?
[236:27.89]No, I wouldn't.
[236:32.16]That's the link right there.
[236:32.94]DragonBreath75.deviantart.com Here it is.
[236:36.58]Alright.
[236:41.21]So I'm going to talk to him.
[236:42.93]How did you get up there?
[236:45.71]There are no ladders or steps.
[236:47.21]He cannot have been pinned up there alive unless it was done by a group of ten or while he was unconscious or dead drunk.
[236:53.64]It is more likely, in fact, that he was pinned in place by some magic, the work of a sorcerer then.
[237:01.42]Why would anybody put him here?
[237:03.76]It isn't public enough for an execution, but it is hardly serendipitous.
[237:08.00]It is hardly serendipitous.
[237:11.34]Where are his belongings?
[237:14.08]Staring at the skeleton, you finally realize the most curious aspect of this macabre display.
[237:19.75]Where are the creature's belongings?
[237:21.73]Indeed, where are his clothes?
[237:23.89]The skeleton has not a scrap or rag of cloth on his bones, not a ring, boot, hat.
[237:28.63]Whoever did this made sure to strip him of everything.
[237:31.63]Whatever for?
[237:33.83]Cut him down.
[237:35.58]You could cut him down, or let him rest on his cot.
[237:39.04]At least, even if you do not have time for a burial.
[237:41.90]But there seems no way to reach him.
[237:47.83]Alright, what can I do?
[237:57.81]Yeah, let me throw three stamina in the trash to zap a dead guy.
[238:04.74]Why would I want to be big?
[238:07.47]To pick him up and grab him?
[238:14.61]Resurrect the dead.
[238:21.30]Yeah.
[238:22.58]I'm bringing this guy back to life.
[238:23.70]I didn't realize it was a skeleton.
[238:29.54]I hope this guy is fucking neutral.
[238:33.81]Resurrect the dead.
[238:35.91]Cast it.
[238:39.82]You take the vial of holy water from your pack and cast your spell.
[238:43.10]The water begins to shimmer and shine with an inner light.
[238:46.14]Then you toss the holy water at the hanging skeleton.
[238:49.19]Oh fuck, I didn't take him down.
[238:50.17]I didn't get him down.
[238:51.11]After a moment, the spell takes effect and the creature's head suddenly lifts up.
[238:53.73]The skull turns this way and that, and the arms tug at their restraints.
[238:59.44]I didn't take him down.
[239:00.48]I forgot to take him off the fucking hooks.
[239:02.58]He's like, he's up there on hooks right now.
[239:09.10]Who are you?
[239:10.54]The skeleton's head snaps around as though searching for you.
[239:14.14]It tugs and pulls at its bonds once more and its jaw flaps, but it seems unable to speak.
[239:21.21]Fuck.
[239:27.09]Uh...
[239:29.10]Should I read his mind?
[239:31.66]Oh, read his mind.
[239:32.52]Where's the skull cap?
[239:35.48]I just got that.
[239:36.28]Where'd it go?
[239:37.04]Should I cast the resurrect again?
[239:42.62]I'm going to go big and I'm going to grab him.
[239:49.10]Okay, I'm going to grow inside.
[239:54.26]I'm going to pick him up because I can't reach him.
[239:56.23]Grow inside.
[240:00.23]You wind the constellations into alignment around you, quickly swelling to the height of a tree.
[240:04.66]Lift down the skeleton.
[240:07.02]You reach up and slice the straps around the skeleton's legs.
[240:09.96]Then you carefully lift him down from the hooks and carry him over to his cot.
[240:13.68]At first he struggles and fights, but seems to relax into your arms as he realizes you are carrying him.
[240:20.23]Oh, okay.
[240:23.39]Once on the cot, he seems to sigh and turns over, curling up as though into a peaceful sleep.
[240:30.07]As you pull up the old blanket across his shoulders, a small metal whistle on a leather cord rolls out from a fold.
[240:39.08]Put it around his neck?
[240:42.94]Why would I put it around his neck?
[240:49.64]A whistle?
[240:52.89]What's a whistle gonna do for me?
[240:57.27]Hmm...
[240:59.80]I'm going to put it around his neck.
[241:02.08]Maybe that'll give him the strength to talk.
[241:05.78]You place the loop of leather around the skeleton's skull.
[241:08.14]Perhaps it will help him summon aid in whatever afterlife he has attained.
[241:12.64]Then the spell finally fades and the felton falls still, quite dead once more.
[241:18.61]You leave the hut to continue your walk.
[241:24.95]Okay.
[241:25.05]Okay.
[241:27.92]Just tucked in a skeleton.
[241:32.79]Yeah, I just tuck him in.
[241:34.75]He was a little sleepy.
[241:37.69]From the path, the mountain joins the ancient road.
[241:40.45]Gradually, you shrink back down to your normal size.
[241:43.18]The sky is blue and pink.
[241:45.28]You stand in the foothills of the mountains.
[241:47.06]Looking east, the wide waters of Lake Iqalala gleam in the sunlight.
[241:51.86]A High Point in the rocks would make a good place to stop and eat.
[241:55.19]Just to the south is a deep fissure in the land as though something gigantic had stamped its foot and cracked the Earth.
[242:01.45]Rest.
[242:02.93]You settle down on the rocks to regain something's strength.
[242:06.99]What?
[242:08.21]You settle down on the rocks to regain something's strength.
[242:12.12]But before you managed to make yourself comfortable, you were disturbed by a deep rumble somewhere in the Earth below.
[242:18.66]Get the fuck up.
[242:21.19]You stand to leave, and your foot dislodges a chunk of rock, which rolls away towards the fissure.
[242:27.40]But then abruptly it stops, reverses direction, and begins to roll towards you.
[242:35.29]Dodge left.
[242:37.25]You dodge left, and the rock shoots past you, impacting into dust against an overhang.
[242:41.57]The rumbling is growing louder, and even bigger explosion is coming.
[242:49.18]Imagine being dead for like a hundred years, and you wake up to a gigantic Jerma tucking you into bed.
[243:01.19]It's okay.
[243:02.29]Sleep now, honey.
[243:03.25]Alright, well there's obviously shit flying around here.
[243:09.31]Cause slowness?
[243:18.26]Is something throwing rocks at me?
[243:22.16]I don't get it.
[243:24.94]Is this the ground doing this?
[243:26.45]Is it shooting from the ground?
[243:27.51]Or is this something invisible?
[243:29.07]Or is it just rocks flying at me?
[243:33.37]I could do a panic foff.
[243:35.19]F-O-F.
[243:35.55]Panic F-O-F.
[243:36.33]I think that's a good call.
[243:37.62]But that's magic protection, isn't it?
[243:45.31]It's three stamina though, that's way too much.
[243:48.31]For a panic foff.
[243:53.24]Run.
[243:54.52]Oh, yeah, go!
[243:59.54]Okay.
[244:00.56]You turn and run, the rock surface explodes and you are showered with falling stones.
[244:03.94]There's my fucking... Hey, there's my three stamina to cast the move that would protect me from this.
[244:09.40]You are knocked off your feet, the ground opens up directly where you fall, forming the shape of a freshly dug grave.
[244:17.09]I'm at the bottom of a pit now.
[244:20.53]Are you shitting me?
[244:24.63]You are at the bottom of a deep pit.
[244:26.53]Dust and small stones are still raining over the lip.
[244:30.34]Look around.
[244:30.90]The walls of the pit are smooth, not carved, as though this pit had been drilled.
[244:35.24]There's no way to climb out.
[244:36.86]The Earth below is creaking and hissing with steam.
[244:40.28]You're about nine feet below the rim of the pit.
[244:43.04]You may be able to jump and grab the edge, but it is unlikely.
[244:46.46]Suddenly, a rocky protrusion breaks through the pit floor.
[244:49.54]It glows red.
[244:50.58]It is boiling hot.
[245:02.49]I can't do Zen because I don't have the fucking medallion.
[245:08.84]Zip, no teleportation, don't have the green ring.
[245:15.12]Mud, create quicksand?
[245:18.30]Maybe that'll like... I think that's gonna gunk up the fucking shit that's on the ground.
[245:23.75]The fire.
[245:26.13]What about big?
[245:28.61]I don't have access to big.
[245:31.39]Cause fixedness, I don't have what it requires.
[245:36.91]Nope.
[245:41.04]Heal disease.
[245:41.68]What do I need to do that for?
[245:45.20]I could do force field or I could gunk up this shit.
[245:54.61]Yeah, I'm gonna gunk this place up.
[246:01.87]Great quicksand.
[246:04.74]I'm gonna fill this place with quicksand and it's gonna gunk up all this shit.
[246:07.93]No, I'm not.
[246:08.29]That's a bad idea.
[246:08.99]I'm gonna kill myself.
[246:10.77]Um... I'm gonna look at it.
[246:22.98]The spike of rock sticks up from the floor.
[246:25.55]It glows a deep boiling red and steam rises from its sides where it touches the cold air.
[246:31.31]As you consider your options, you feel something bite at your ankle.
[246:37.94]I'm gonna gunk it up.
[246:39.30]No, something's biting me now.
[246:41.46]This shit's getting gunked up.
[246:46.98]Something's biting me now.
[246:48.29]There's lava everywhere.
[246:50.43]Gunk it up.
[246:52.93]You scatter the last of your sand across the ground and then cast the spell.
[246:56.48]The sand begins to move, moving round and round faster and faster until it forms a whirlpool that descends into the Earth itself.
[247:03.64]Unfortunately, opening a whirlpool directly under your feet is hardly a clever escape plan.
[247:08.41]You are sucked away and have no way of escape.
[247:12.13]You've been sucked away into a whirlpool.
[247:15.63]What the fuck is they talking about?
[247:20.07]No, like, honest to God, it's quicksand?
[247:22.95]I just made a fucking tornado?
[247:29.75]I tried to get it all gunked up!
[247:33.43]I thought that was quicksand.
[247:39.71]Ugh.
[247:42.53]What the fuck is they talking about?
[247:47.35]Ugh, dead.
[247:49.66]Get gunked.
[247:52.36]Thanks a lot, Bob.
[247:53.94]Thanks, Mink.
[247:54.56]And Bob again.
[247:55.78]Vic for first noble.
[248:00.27]I wonder how much time we have before the stream dies.
[248:02.29]Alright.
[248:05.43]I'm going to try to get to the water serpent before the stream is over.
[248:11.20]I'm right here.
[248:12.00]Look at how close I am.
[248:16.12]Alright, the yawning pit.
[248:17.82]That's a death.
[248:18.78]Mark it on the calendar.
[248:19.72]You're at the bottom of a pit.
[248:23.08]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[248:24.00]You're stuck down here.
[248:24.98]Yeah, I know.
[248:25.56]Some fucking little beetle or ant starts biting your ankles.
[248:31.00]Cast a spell.
[248:41.81]Can't do foff.
[248:43.27]I can't do anything.
[248:45.67]I have nothing.
[248:51.63]I don't have anything.
[248:52.27]I'm gonna have to jump.
[249:00.84]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no force field!
[249:04.48]You cast a spell forming a shimmering force field around your body.
[249:07.66]You should be protected from all the most serious injury.
[249:11.47]But the force field does not keep out the heat of the rock.
[249:15.00]As you consider your options you feel something bite your ankle.
[249:17.00]Just jump.
[249:18.00]You try a jump reaching for the edge of the pit and miss landing painfully on the pit floor.
[249:23.00]How do you miss ju- like I just jumped into the ground?
[249:28.00]The ground to your right breaks and another glowing spike emerges. The pit is becoming very warm - you're being cooked alive.
[249:34.00]Ah another the spike of the rock sticks up in the floor, it glows a deep boiling red. Steam rises. Another spike of rock emerges from the floor, the pit is filling up.
[249:42.00]Climb the spike.
[249:46.15]You look at the glowing spike, it may be hot, but you can clamber onto it just for a moment.
[249:50.37]It may give you the height you need to escape.
[249:53.49]Another rock breaks the side of the pit, boiling hot to the touch.
[249:56.33]You can no longer stand the temperature.
[249:58.61]You've been cooked alive in a pit.
[250:03.85]Oh, you're gonna die down there.
[250:05.59]Oh, I can cook my meat down here.
[250:10.34]I don't think I can get out of here.
[250:13.53]I think I'm stuck down here forever.
[250:16.77]There's no way for me to get out.
[250:22.53]The rocks are coming.
[250:24.22]I can't get out of here.
[250:25.10]Dude, I can't get out.
[250:34.26]I cannot get out.
[250:36.38]I think this is where the game ends for me.
[250:39.08]I cannot leave.
[250:44.76]The forceful didn't do shit.
[250:50.54]These are my only options for spells.
[250:54.27]Fix.
[250:54.65]I'll cast fixedness.
[250:59.59]I can't do dock because I don't have the item.
[251:01.51]I don't have a medicinal potion.
[251:07.01]I can't do rock.
[251:07.75]There's no R. I'm going to have to like...
[251:15.72]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[251:16.48]Look at the spike.
[251:19.09]Climb the spike.
[251:21.64]Okay, hold on.
[251:22.10]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[251:22.78]I'm going to be fine.
[251:23.28]I'm going to be fine.
[251:24.80]So I just got to climb straight forward.
[251:26.74]You look at the glowing spike.
[251:27.48]It may be hot, but you can clamber onto it for a moment.
[251:29.80]The ground breaks another.
[251:30.88]The pit's becoming very warm.
[251:32.00]Climb.
[251:33.48]Stealing your courage, you clamber up the glowing rock in the center of the pit.
[251:36.22]There is a searing noise as your bare palms touch the rock surface, and the smell of cooked meat fills the pit.
[251:43.79]Then you get your boots underneath.
[251:44.97]You straighten up and reach for the lip of the pit.
[251:46.73]You are almost free.
[251:47.73]Jump.
[251:48.85]You jump for the lip of the pit, miss and fall back down, narrowly missing a rock spike.
[251:54.25]Another spike of... What?
[251:59.56]There's nothing for it.
[252:00.38]You try again, clambering onto a new, taller spike.
[252:03.24]Jump for the pit edge.
[252:05.34]Then you jump, grab the edge with your fingers, and haul yourself up from the pit.
[252:09.74]Gasp for breath.
[252:12.80]I actually got the fuck out.
[252:16.58]I got out.
[252:17.52]We're here.
[252:19.13]Cast mud.
[252:24.71]To review, we just spent the last 20 minutes tucking a skeleton into bed and dying in a pit over and over again.
[252:32.19]That's sorcery for you.
[252:36.51]Outside the pit.
[252:40.55]You're out of the pit, but the danger is by no means past.
[252:43.67]Cracks are radiating across the ground.
[252:45.74]One opens between your feet.
[252:47.32]Jump!
[252:47.84]What the fuck?
[252:49.88]You jump clear just in time to avoid being swallowed.
[252:52.24]Turning, you spot a large boulder on top of the rise where you paused, resting.
[252:56.34]Dodge left.
[252:57.44]Always left.
[252:58.85]You prepare to dodge but find something is holding your leg.
[253:01.29]A small green snake has wrapped itself around your ankle and is attempting to bite you.
[253:06.13]Run it through.
[253:08.28]What the fuck?
[253:09.66]You draw your sword to run the creature through.
[253:11.36]When suddenly it begins to grow in size, the skin blisters and breaks, and a huge winged serpent made of crystals and rock coils up, spitting stone shards as it hisses, This is the Earth Serpent.
[253:29.44]Oh, shit!
[253:30.14]The Earth Serpent?
[253:32.52]What the fuck is that?
[253:33.48]Throw something?
[253:34.24]Throw something at it.
[253:39.12]I don't know what the... Hold on.
[253:43.86]Clues.
[253:45.54]The Earth Serpent.
[253:47.14]I don't have a fucking clue for the Earth Serpent.
[253:53.27]How do I get rid of the Earth Serpent?
[253:56.45]Let's see what I have.
[254:05.93]I don't have enough stamina.
[254:08.90]I have to pray to the whale first.
[254:12.70]Pray for healing.
[254:14.42]Yes.
[254:15.06]Okay.
[254:16.46]Okay.
[254:19.61]Cast a spell.
[254:22.85]I'm gonna get two fucking stones with one burn, you know what I mean?
[254:31.31]Earth.
[254:32.11]What counters Earth?
[254:33.83]Google it.
[254:37.83]dud treasure no he's not gonna give a shit it's Earth air electricity nip cause speed no water
[254:58.76]Depression oh yeah of course oh yeah, it goes Earth Counters water water counters fire fire counters depression depression counters Earth got it.
[255:08.81]I knew it Mud Great quicksand
[255:23.51]Speed, blow the horn.
[255:31.91]Zob?
[255:33.35]Zob!
[255:36.52]Pray to Lorag, the sauna wizard god.
[255:41.68]Air versus Earth, but what is the air spell?
[255:47.38]Nif?
[255:47.88]Cause stench?
[255:51.69]I have the Galehorn, but what's the Galehorn spell?
[255:55.35]Huff.
[255:56.21]Create wind.
[255:56.77]There it is.
[255:58.79]Is that going to counter Earth?
[256:01.74]No, it definitely is.
[256:04.16]That's absolutely what's going to happen.
[256:07.02]Remember when I blew this before and all the dirt and sand and shit when I blew all the Earth over?
[256:10.87]It's either Huff or...
[256:20.14]It's either Huff or Zap.
[256:21.98]No.
[256:22.74]Electricity wouldn't do anything.
[256:26.04]Okay, guys.
[256:26.64]I'm going to need to pull here.
[256:29.04]Huff, Zap, or Nip.
[256:34.74]Because I can be really fast.
[256:36.72]Huff, Zap, or Nip.
[256:38.36]Because I don't have any water spells.
[256:42.40]You guys get to decide my fate.
[256:44.50]Because I'm not entirely sure what it is.
[256:53.68]Let's get this ready.
[256:58.34]Zap.
[256:59.84]Huff.
[257:00.96]Or nip.
[257:03.93]Great pull.
[257:06.17]Alright guys, this is a very important encounter.
[257:09.87]Need the guidance of the chat.
[257:13.36]Ask the audience.
[257:14.22]Phone a friend.
[257:19.32]Holy shit.
[257:20.94]By a huge margin.
[257:26.68]There's no zob.
[257:28.12]Zob, zob, zob.
[257:29.76]No zob.
[257:30.56]I don't know what it even does.
[257:35.57]Is Vic for First Noble a valid answer for this poll?
[257:39.63]It's always a valid answer.
[257:46.66]I don't even... The poll can just close right now.
[257:50.36]Huff is winning by 400 fucking votes.
[257:55.40]Somebody just wrote, why do you guys want Jerma to win?
[257:59.66]Why do you want me to win?
[258:00.94]Zob, Zob, Zob, Zob, Zob, Zob.
[258:07.81]I'm gonna cast Zob and I'm gonna explode.
[258:12.85]Slava by Zob.
[258:18.06]Okay, it's Huff.
[258:19.72]Poll is closed.
[258:20.40]We're blowing the Galehorn.
[258:23.20]H-U-F.
[258:25.14]Thank you for voting.
[258:26.86]Create wind.
[258:28.80]Listen to me, son!
[258:32.63]You cast the enchantment, placing your Galehorn to your lips and playing a clear tone.
[258:36.61]A powerful wind is summoned, striking the wings of the snake and lifting it up into the air.
[258:40.89]The serpent roars and hisses, but once off the ground, everything changes.
[258:48.65]Oh, no, wait.
[258:49.53]The Earth settles and the serpent itself shrinks once more to the size of a small snake.
[258:57.48]Strangle it.
[259:02.80]You catch the creature's throat in one fist and throttle the life from it.
[259:06.48]It rattles, gasps, and then hangs limp from your fist like an old rope.
[259:11.04]The Earth bellow is still.
[259:14.00]You have now defeated three of the seven serpents.
[259:19.55]Dude, we just pressed on his head.
[259:22.97]What a zob slob.
[259:24.42]Thanks, dude.
[259:26.34]Here goes my last bits for now.
[259:27.52]You're my favorite streamer, YouTube.
[259:28.84]Well, thanks a lot, squirts.
[259:30.56]Appreciate it, man.
[259:32.88]I appreciate it, dude.
[259:36.03]Flawless victory.
[259:36.91]Didn't even need to take my sword out.
[259:38.17]Yeah, and you guys wanted to zob it.
[259:40.61]Let's get some stone dust.
[259:44.09]You gather up the stone dust into your pack.
[259:45.72]You need to rest and recover.
[259:46.92]Your search for the serpents is so far as taking its toll.
[259:51.20]Well, about to kill another one.
[259:53.16]Like, right now.
[259:56.53]Electric man hype.
[259:59.87]Lake Shore.
[260:00.37]Let's go kill this motherfucker.
[260:01.43]I have the oil in my pocket.
[260:02.51]I'm gonna throw it at him.
[260:03.27]He's gonna, like, get grossed out and drown himself.
[260:08.62]You follow the road as it curves and it bends and finally begins to descend until it reaches the shores of its lake.
[260:13.91]Looking out across the vast expanse of still water which stretches to the horizon, your resolve grows.
[260:19.65]How can you cross?
[260:21.05]There are no signs of either people or boats.
[260:23.47]The far shore is nothing but a blur against the sky.
[260:29.15]Where is he?
[260:29.71]It looks like he's like right here.
[260:32.34]Is he in the water or is he like... I don't get it.
[260:42.19]I'm going to walk along the line.
[260:44.91]For several strides, you follow the sandy shore eastwards, but find nothing of note.
[260:49.12]The shoreline ends in a collapsed seawall.
[260:51.54]It seems this was once a harbor of some kind.
[260:55.18]Get some sand.
[260:56.80]Get a handful of sand.
[260:59.30]In the distance over the water, a few bird-like creatures turn in the sky.
[261:05.48]You call out loudly and wait.
[261:08.28]Ten minutes pass, but nothing happens.
[261:13.83]Climbed out of a pit with cooked hands, then strangled a snake with said cooked hands.
[261:19.11]Those are going to get infected, dude.
[261:25.62]For an hour you wait.
[261:27.52]As the sun climbs towards its zenith, the wind picks up.
[261:30.76]But apart from the occasional small animal darting around the waterline, the area seems to be completely deserted.
[261:37.46]Thin clouds drift across the open sky above the lake.
[261:42.53]Hello?
[261:43.05]Hello?
[261:44.99]You try calling again, there is no response.
[261:46.81]Wasn't there supposed to be a ferryman?
[261:50.16]Swim across the lake.
[261:52.46]Hold on a second.
[261:53.44]Walk the other way.
[261:54.72]You walk back and try the other way.
[261:55.96]Again, you come across nothing that might help you.
[261:58.68]I will fucking... Whatever.
[261:59.60]I'm not going to look like a dickhead and sit here the whole time.
[262:07.78]Wait, was this the ferryman?
[262:08.84]I don't understand.
[262:17.04]Was that the dead guy?
[262:17.90]The ferryman?
[262:22.04]Whatever.
[262:22.32]Examine them.
[262:42.76]You pause to look in the cracks between the stones, hoping to perhaps find a gold piece or two buried under the topsoil.
[262:47.94]But there's nothing.
[262:48.82]This place has been scoured bare by the wind of centuries.
[262:51.86]You march onwards.
[262:52.57]You are beginning to feel hungry.
[262:57.27]Fuck it.
[262:57.53]I'm going swimming.
[263:01.69]Swim across the lake.
[263:02.39]I'm going to meet him head on.
[263:04.63]The lake is wider than the eye can see.
[263:06.45]To swim across it might take an entire day.
[263:08.35]You cannot go...
[263:10.32]You step down into the water's edge.
[263:12.02]Do what you can to secure your pack and then dive in.
[263:14.32]At least the water is warm.
[263:16.85]Where is he?
[263:18.79]Where is this water serpent?
[263:22.59]This way.
[263:22.87]I'm losing stamina.
[263:51.12]Oh, God.
[264:16.35]You watch as one tiny fish clamps your thumb with tiny needle-like teeth and sucks a few drops of blood.
[264:23.24]Eat it.
[264:24.74]You turn the table swiftly, lifting the fish to your mouth and biting it in half.
[264:28.48]It is succulent, if somewhat bony.
[264:31.13]The rest of the show will immediately turn about and approach you on the attack.
[264:36.35]Oh, shit.
[264:44.11]Cast Zap.
[264:45.77]Cast Zap.
[264:47.26]No, I wanna cast Zap.
[264:50.92]Zap.
[264:55.82]This is gonna kill me.
[264:59.04]This is gonna kill me.
[265:06.88]Looking to the constellations above, you craft the spell, winding a powerful electric force in your hand.
[265:11.84]The charge builds up on your palm then spreads into the water, electrocuting the fish in a fast explosive chain.
[265:19.71]You yourself are thankfully protected by the spell.
[265:23.63]The energy crackles away and the water is still.
[265:26.17]Dead fish litter the water like leaves on a pool.
[265:30.29]Sapped them.
[265:32.22]I will take a few cooked fish, by the way.
[265:35.71]You collect a few and slip them into your pack for use for food later.
[265:38.50]They have been lightly grilled.
[265:40.64]You swim onwards.
[265:45.72]Okay, I'm going to die in here.
[265:46.58]I need to get to land.
[265:50.89]You try to sustain.
[265:53.61]Zap only run.
[265:56.43]You try to sustain a regular stroke as you swim.
[265:58.14]Another night begins and you are suffering badly.
[266:00.56]You need to rest.
[266:01.96]You pause for a moment, treading water and catching your breath.
[266:04.26]The size of the lake is beginning to dawn on you.
[266:07.80]Just keep swimming like that Disney movie.
[266:11.98]You set your mind to swimming.
[266:17.41]That way.
[266:22.09]Swimming like this is hard work.
[266:23.21]The moon crawls across the heavens like a dull pearl.
[266:28.17]Everything around you is wonderfully calm and still.
[266:29.99]For a moment, you can believe you are the only living thing in the world.
[266:33.86]You have swum within reach of the bay of a low island.
[266:36.54]You will need to go ashore and recover.
[266:39.04]Okay.
[266:40.68]Lightly grilled fried fish fillets.
[266:44.15]You haul yourself up onto the shoreline.
[266:47.84]There is no way to cross the water in the dark, and exploring inland would be unwise.
[266:53.10]You'll have to rest here.
[266:54.82]Unstrapping your pack on the shore of the lake, you try to stretch out despise the shivering cold of your still-wet clothing.
[267:01.28]At least you've eaten once today already.
[267:04.02]I'm going to eat another fried fish sandwich.
[267:06.50]You eat one of your smoked fried fish sandwiches and feel a bit better for it.
[267:10.40]Then you lie back and try to forget your troubles.
[267:12.94]You dream you are trapped in a low straw hut.
[267:15.93]Its door sealed with bolts made of bones.
[267:18.73]A small fire is burning in one corner but quickly spreads until you are surrounded by flame.
[267:24.67]You feel yourself starting to sweat from the heat.
[267:27.78]Wake up.
[267:29.80]And you wake up to find a ball of fire raging mere inches from you.
[267:36.28]Uh.
[267:38.38]What the fuck?
[267:40.46]The fire does not seem to be fueled.
[267:42.10]It is a ball about three feet wide, gushing with smoke and steam.
[267:45.99]A moment later, it unravels, uncurling into a long animal form.
[267:49.93]It is a fire fox, and it is coming for your neck in a blaze of fur and fire.
[267:56.40]I'm gonna talk to him.
[268:01.48]Yap.
[268:02.60]Come on, where's Yap?
[268:04.79]Oh, what?
[268:05.27]I can't talk to him?
[268:09.13]Fuck.
[268:09.51]I want to, like, talk to this guy.
[268:16.02]No, he's a fire fox.
[268:19.22]Rock.
[268:22.14]Walk.
[268:24.64]I'm going to make a shield.
[268:26.85]One stamina and one gold piece.
[268:28.95]Give me it.
[268:31.36]You place a gold plisse on your wrist and cast the spell, and a moment later the coin is gone.
[268:35.16]You feel the weight of an invisible shield on your arm.
[268:37.95]Then it is upon you to draw your sword and keep your shield high, ready to fight.
[268:41.13]There we go.
[268:43.91]I got the upper hand now.
[268:48.43]Let's just fucking full blast him.
[268:50.34]Like that, like right there.
[268:52.52]Ooh, sorry, Firefox.
[268:55.44]Sorry, Firefox.
[268:57.16]I use Chrome.
[268:59.29]Come on, give me that one.
[269:00.97]That was a wicked good one.
[269:02.29]That was a fucking shitty joke.
[269:05.77]Firefox drops to a crouch.
[269:10.01]Okay, I could have probably overpowered him.
[269:12.81]So, the monster crouches down and snarls.
[269:15.98]Alright, we're gonna go fucking 6.3.
[269:19.36]Fuck me in the face.
[269:25.80]Scratches its fur.
[269:28.85]Eyes flash a deep hot red.
[269:30.59]I wonder if he's gonna... I wonder if this is enough.
[269:35.03]Duh!
[270:07.46]How does it feel to get killed by a web browser?
[270:09.60]Pretty bad.
[270:12.26]Chrome is not responding.
[270:14.34]However, you gotta go full blast.
[270:22.96]Yeah, I got cooked.
[270:24.32]Cooked two ways.
[270:26.22]The monster crouches and snarls.
[270:28.06]I'm coming at him again.
[270:32.38]Deep hot red.
[270:33.30]That means you block.
[270:37.10]He scratches his fur, he's not coming at me hard.
[270:41.02]I'll do that.
[270:42.10]Fuck, why did I do full blast?
[270:43.76]Again, it whimpers.
[270:44.72]Yeah, I know.
[270:45.84]We both need stamina.
[270:47.72]I don't know why you want to fight me so bad.
[270:49.08]I'm wasting so much stamina.
[271:00.55]I gotta stop fucking full blasting him.
[271:03.69]It scratches at the Earth.
[271:06.88]Fucking full blast.
[271:07.74]I don't even care.
[271:08.86]I don't even give a shit.
[271:11.14]He ignites with fire.
[271:12.44]Good for you.
[271:13.74]I've lost like fucking too much.
[271:15.12]You know what?
[271:15.50]Full blast him.
[271:16.04]I don't even care.
[271:16.52]Get me out of here.
[271:18.84]Die.
[271:21.08]Skilled swordplay.
[271:21.90]See?
[271:22.18]It even said it.
[271:22.86]Look it.
[271:23.18]Right there.
[271:23.90]Skilled swordplay.
[271:25.38]You can't make fun of me in the chat when it says skilled swordplay.
[271:31.62]You collapse back exhausted and scorched from the encounter.
[271:33.88]With luck, the rest of the night will be more peaceful.
[271:38.12]Search the creature.
[271:40.38]The creature has no possessions, of course, but it has a fine array of teeth, including four front fangs that seem to glow with faint heat.
[271:50.33]I'll take him.
[271:52.43]With the tip of your sword, you dig out the first of the creature's fangs, but as you tug it free, the tooth cracks and suddenly erupts into flame.
[272:00.85]You drop it smartly, and the fire burns a moment longer before going out.
[272:07.12]Give me his teeth.
[272:10.24]Working more carefully this time, you manage to extract two more fangs without incident.
[272:14.26]The third is harder work, but you cut and tug carefully and manage to extract it successfully.
[272:20.32]You wrap the teeth in cloth and put them into your pack.
[272:23.36]They will come in useful should you need to light a fire.
[272:26.40]Ooh.
[272:28.24]Then tiredness overwhelms you.
[272:30.66]Time to rest.
[272:31.40]Your shield shimmers out of existence.
[272:36.98]I feel like this says this every time.
[272:40.43]You have become weak.
[272:42.07]Gained one provision and lost a bit of gold.
[272:44.61]You defeated the Earth Serpent, so you have now defeated three of the seven serpents of Mangbang.
[272:56.06]Jerma gets cooked two ways.
[272:57.80]Jerma's a talented swordsman.
[273:00.86]I like to think I'm a talented swordsman.
[273:03.60]Somehow.
[273:04.68]Yeah.
[273:08.72]Thanks, Barrows Boy.
[273:10.64]Oh, Barrows Boy.
[273:12.32]The sun rises above the waters of the lake.
[273:13.62]The island is thickly wooded, but all three trees have died, and the whole forest is gray and desolate.
[273:18.66]In the shallows stands a tall pole from which hangs a bell.
[273:23.64]Rest.
[273:25.45]No fucking around at four stamina.
[273:27.73]You meditate.
[273:28.33]The likely day is going to be clear.
[273:30.15]It'll be hot.
[273:31.67]I'll take the five stamina.
[273:34.73]Look at the bell.
[273:36.81]The bell is set with a silver clapper attached to a rope.
[273:40.83]The wind shifts a moment, bringing with it a terrible stench.
[273:44.43]Then the smell is gone.
[273:48.59]Ring it.
[273:50.39]You pull the bell rope, but nothing happens.
[273:52.21]Looking up, you see the clapper of the bell has been lost.
[273:56.55]Throw something at the bell.
[274:01.42]Throw the skull, throw the pipe, throw the chakram, throw a pebble, throw a coin!
[274:06.94]Are you serious?
[274:07.54]You flick a gold piece of the bell that rings with a clear note, but your missile bounces away into the water of the lake and sinks out of sight.
[274:15.17]After a few minutes, a boat slides out of the mist of the lake towards you.
[274:19.93]The ferryman hops down into the shallows.
[274:23.33]Okay.
[274:25.05]Greetings, he calls.
[274:26.69]You'll be wanting to cross Lake Ikala, will you?
[274:28.73]Uh, what's your price?
[274:32.45]Six gold pieces.
[274:34.11]Take it or leave it.
[274:39.69]You pause to look over the ferryman.
[274:41.35]He is a scruffy, unwashed individual, somewhat overweight, but with the shoulders of an ox that he no doubt needs to pull across the water all day.
[274:52.78]That's too much money.
[274:56.39]It's too much.
[274:57.65]Alright, fine.
[274:58.55]I'm out of here.
[275:10.75]Worship.
[275:18.49]I mean, how dumb is this guy?
[275:21.73]Three stamina.
[275:23.07]What if he's just like, it doesn't do anything.
[275:24.53]That's too much stamina to lose.
[275:37.57]Sense danger.
[275:41.31]You weave the starlight into your design around you and a calm voice speaks into your thoughts.
[275:45.89]The voice warns you that there is a tremendous danger close at hand.
[275:50.19]That you must be every moment on your guard.
[275:53.53]The spell fades.
[275:54.37]The ferryman is watching you.
[276:00.02]Alright, well... I'm paying him.
[276:12.88]You change your mind quickly.
[276:13.84]Gold, fuck, I haven't been able to spend my money anyways.
[276:16.02]You change your mind, put the money into his hand, you clamber into the boat, and the ferryman pushes you away from the shore.
[276:21.65]Leave the shore.
[276:22.25]Alright, at least I got a boat now.
[276:26.09]The boat slides away from the shore.
[276:27.43]The sun is hot now.
[276:28.87]The boat drifts.
[276:29.47]The ferryman stands at the prow, scanning the water.
[276:32.42]You going to the ancient road?
[276:34.08]All the way to High Zamen?
[276:37.62]I'm just a trader.
[276:41.59]He smirks.
[276:45.73]Comcast strike.
[276:46.73]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[276:47.41]Is that happening?
[276:47.99]Oh, no.
[276:48.29]Good.
[276:48.87]Oh, my God.
[276:49.27]You scared me.
[276:53.13]Plenty of places to see on Lake Akyla.
[276:54.67]And a few below.
[276:55.13]Hmm.
[277:10.58]Well, I want to go that way because I want to go to the... Yeah, I want to get this.
[277:13.74]I want to unlock that.
[277:17.66]The ferryman pulls the boat onwards across the water.
[277:19.98]Mid-afternoon haze makes the air sticky.
[277:22.36]It seems you have reached a part of the lake that is too deep for the pole.
[277:25.56]The ferryman points sharply at you and snaps, Take the oars, fool, and start rowing.
[277:30.74]Somehow his manner seems to have changed quite suddenly.
[277:32.96]His tone is altogether more aggressive.
[277:36.82]Then give me my fucking money.
[277:38.04]Demand my money back.
[277:41.42]If I'm going to row, I want my money back.
[277:43.98]Take it, the ferryman replies, tossing the coins at your feet.
[277:47.94]Fine, fuck you.
[277:50.62]I paid for a trip, not to do work.
[277:54.16]Got that money back.
[277:55.94]You reach down and collect the gold pieces.
[277:57.44]He nods twice to himself and steps down from the prow to near the row lock.
[278:03.83]But he doesn't do anything for a moment more, letting the boat drift on.
[278:09.81]This way.
[278:13.85]The ferryman continues to row, the sun is beginning to lower, and the air begins to cool.
[278:18.26]From his place at the oars, the ferryman watches you thoughtfully.
[278:21.68]You been to Tanping?
[278:23.58]You from there?
[278:26.44]Yeah.
[278:27.30]Yeah, I'm from there.
[278:28.44]You lie cautiously.
[278:30.47]Don't look like someone from there.
[278:32.49]Most people that come from Timpang look more desperate than you.
[278:36.99]I'm different.
[278:39.36]Strange place, Chimpang.
[278:41.38]Was destroyed a long time ago.
[278:43.28]Turned into a ruin.
[278:44.76]Completely abandoned.
[278:46.20]Long, long time ago.
[278:48.00]But people still come down that road time and time again.
[278:50.66]Wanting ferrymen from there.
[278:53.09]It's most of my trade.
[278:57.33]The man is clearly mad.
[279:00.47]The man is clearly mad.
[279:02.63]No doubt driven that way from so long as a ferryman on the abandoned lake.
[279:06.86]You smile politely but do not answer.
[279:09.43]Well?
[279:10.74]The ferryman replies with a twinkle in his eye.
[279:13.64]I can see you'll never be setting foot in Timpang again anyhow.
[279:19.24]Here we go, near the island.
[279:24.22]The ferryman pulls at the oars on a regular rhythm.
[279:26.95]The evening is drawing in.
[279:27.81]It'll be dark soon.
[279:28.57]You travel for a moment in silence.
[279:32.87]You gotta ask everybody, right?
[279:34.31]Hey, what can you tell me of the seven serpents?
[279:37.05]Seven serpents, he replies thoughtfully.
[279:39.19]Well, there are seven of them, but there's only one you need to worry about.
[279:46.51]And which one is that?
[279:48.01]You'll see soon enough.
[279:50.33]His expression is distant and glazed over.
[279:52.11]He has stopped lifting the oars, and yet the boat still moves onwards across the water as though compelled.
[280:00.62]Let's move in the boat.
[280:02.36]He does not reply.
[280:03.50]He does not seem to have heard you.
[280:05.50]His face is static and unmoving.
[280:10.12]Shake him.
[280:10.58]You reach over and shake his arm.
[280:12.03]The ferryman's mouth falls open.
[280:13.81]A curious hissing sound emerges.
[280:17.39]Jump.
[280:17.87]Oh, fuck.
[280:18.35]I'm getting out of here.
[280:20.87]Draw the sword.
[280:22.59]You go for your sword as a plume of thick smoke emerges from between his teeth.
[280:26.68]His body remains in a place for a moment, then collapses like a limp sack, slithering into the bottom of the boat.
[280:36.60]This is the water serpent.
[280:38.44]Has to be, right?
[280:42.16]Do I throw the oil now?
[280:42.84]Throw the oil now, right?
[280:43.64]No.
[280:43.70]How do I use the oil?
[280:54.89]Zap him.
[280:56.11]Fucking zap him.
[280:57.91]No, no, no, no.
[280:59.41]I have a specific item.
[281:07.18]Look at the ferryman.
[281:10.84]You bend down towards the ferryman.
[281:12.20]Nothing remains but a pile of clothing.
[281:14.14]The swirling creature overhead becomes agitated and starts to flicker and waft in your face.
[281:18.80]Its gas is choking and noxious.
[281:21.08]There is a choking smell filling your nostrils.
[281:24.70]Wave away the fucking fart gas.
[281:27.08]You wave at the gas, which is swirling aggressively around you, but you seem unable to make it clear.
[281:31.10]The vapors are beginning to form a familiar shape.
[281:33.85]The gas forms the shape of a winged serpent.
[281:35.61]This is the serpent of air.
[281:38.49]This is not the water serpent.
[281:40.57]Prepare to die, it cries as tendrils of its grace.
[281:44.02]It's got gas.
[281:47.92]Blow the horn again.
[281:52.79]Search the ferryman's clothing.
[281:59.58]Air.
[282:01.18]I don't think the Galehorn is going to work on the fucking master of the Galehorn.
[282:09.66]Zob.
[282:12.22]Zap?
[282:12.52]What does it mean?
[282:13.10]No.
[282:14.04]Air.
[282:15.84]Okay, I can make six of me.
[282:27.03]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[282:28.31]Don't act so fucking hasty.
[282:31.57]The air serpent.
[282:33.39]When the air serpent leaves its body as a gas, its body is vulnerable.
[282:43.24]What?
[282:43.62]Fuck.
[282:43.94]What?
[282:47.18]What does that mean?
[282:58.82]Oh, fuck.
[283:01.00]I could have blown the gas with the Galehorn.
[283:04.99]Well, you know, in times like these, you fucking just zap.
[283:12.41]You weave the spell, generating a charge of electrical energy within your palm.
[283:15.92]Then you fire the bolt of the serpent, and it passes straight through into the air.
[283:20.66]The serpent is now fully formed, but extends one airy tendril up until your nostril is a terrible smell.
[283:26.97]A moment later, that tendril solidifies inside your brain.
[283:30.37]Your death is at least painless.
[283:32.87]Your brain has been pierced by the air serpent.
[283:41.56]Alright, so I was right here.
[283:42.84]He turned into gas.
[283:46.56]That's alright.
[283:49.23]Yeah, yeah, fuck off.
[283:51.37]Why don't you turn into that gas again, huh?
[283:54.03]Why don't you do me a favor and turn into that gas one more time?
[283:59.76]What do you think?
[284:03.74]Yeah, which one?
[284:04.42]Oh, yeah, you'll see soon enough.
[284:05.52]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[284:06.38]What's going on here?
[284:09.72]Oh, no, something's wrong with him.
[284:12.94]Oh, watch out.
[284:13.96]He's a hissing sound.
[284:15.46]Help, drop my sword.
[284:18.25]Oh, what's that?
[284:19.21]Was it a gas?
[284:20.27]Okay.
[284:26.39]H. U. No.
[284:30.71]H. U. F. Cause.
[284:34.34]Wind.
[284:35.90]Blow it.
[284:48.70]It's that easy.
[284:54.90]You weave the spell, raising the gale horn and blowing a shrill note.
[284:58.26]The creature, the air serpent itself, struggles to hold itself together in the face of the blast of the wind from the horn, but it cannot manage it.
[285:04.26]A moment later, it has been blown quite literally to smithereens, and all is quiet.
[285:08.66]The boat rocks twice, then falls silent.
[285:12.19]You have now defeated four of the seven serpents.
[285:15.67]You have dealt with more than half the deadly serpents who have come into sight of a small island.
[285:20.61]So where's the water serpent?
[285:23.63]I thought that was the water serpent.
[285:26.87]He's just in here.
[285:30.83]Easiest serpent of my life.
[285:32.89]Okay, I seriously thought that just said, go asshole.
[285:36.35]Honestly, look at that.
[285:37.63]Take a look.
[285:38.35]That says, go asshole.
[285:42.67]Middle of the lake.
[285:43.79]Middle of the lake.
[285:44.86]On the lake.
[285:45.80]Go asshole.
[285:50.64]Is there anything a Galehorn can't do?
[285:52.04]I don't know.
[285:56.14]Alright, you row the boat onwards out of the cross of water and pull over to the other shore.
[285:59.19]The wind picks up as the evening draws on.
[286:00.77]Soon it will be dark.
[286:01.47]Get out of the boat!
[286:03.77]Get out of that boat.
[286:08.72]The serpent of air was weak to air.
[286:12.54]Yeah, that doesn't seem right.
[286:14.04]I agree.
[286:16.91]I sneezed on the serpent.
[286:19.27]The island is covered in dense tree cover.
[286:21.71]The top of a stone tower is just visible above the canopy.
[286:25.55]By the shoreline is another pole with a bell.
[286:27.15]Pulled up in the shallows is your rowboat.
[286:29.52]Black gloomy clouds roll across the sky, flowing from the east.
[286:34.74]I'm not ringing that bell again.
[286:37.52]I'm going to activate this tower.
[286:41.37]Let's get it moving.
[286:44.98]Zap.
[287:13.89]Uh, I'm going to do how, if it's available.
[287:16.71]There it is.
[287:17.65]Safe passage.
[287:21.31]You bind the magic and a quiet voice begins to speak to you.
[287:24.23]The voice indicates a thin path that will lead to this island's tower.
[287:28.30]With that, the spell fades.
[287:30.24]A flock of nearby birds startle at something, lifting suddenly into the trees.
[287:38.21]Thin path, so follow the narrow track.
[287:41.52]Trusting your spell, you follow the narrow track between the trees.
[287:44.94]After a few minutes of walking, you come with a sight of the base of the stone tower.
[287:48.99]It's heavily overgrown.
[287:49.99]Aha!
[287:51.29]The whale was correct.
[287:54.27]The door opens and roots and stuff.
[287:58.95]Go in the tower.
[288:02.19]The inside of the tower is dank and filled with mud, as though it's been flooded and emptied several times.
[288:08.82]Stone stairs curve up to a hatch in the roof.
[288:11.70]You gasp as you notice the walls, which are covered floor to ceiling with intricate carvings.
[288:16.90]Suddenly, something lights up in one dark corner, a flame.
[288:26.50]Look at it.
[288:28.69]The flame seems to hover a short way off the ground.
[288:31.03]As you watch, it swells in size from a single thumb to a fireball size of a small dish.
[288:39.09]You look around quickly for somewhere to shelter, but apart from the staircase that runs up the tower, there are no walls, no furniture, and no cover of any kind.
[288:46.60]The fire has grown now to a full fireball of clearly magical nature.
[288:51.70]and in its light you can see what is holding it.
[288:54.22]It's a rough wooden frame of sticks, shaped into the form of a woman with arms spread wide.
[289:00.70]It's a Grimalkin!
[289:02.84]What the fuck is a Grimalkin?
[289:06.67]Like those you saw as an apprentice, magical constructions which gather the magic
[289:12.47]let me read that again my like brain just froze it is a grimalkin like those you saw as an apprentice magical constructions which gather magic the way a funnel gathers rain water you wait and watch a fireball hot and fierce shoots forward from the wooden frame towards you duck no I don't no no no no oh no okay yeah dodge right
[289:39.70]Fireball goes right by you.
[289:41.59]Not aiming at the door, but instead splashing up the staircase that leads up the tower.
[289:45.65]The room is dark for a moment.
[289:46.81]Let's look at it.
[289:52.70]I want to see this for a second.
[289:53.64]What the fuck is a Grimalkin?
[289:57.29]I don't know.
[290:00.02]In the pause between fireballs and darkness, you can see a little of the Grimalkin.
[290:04.32]The frame is built from old half-rotten wood, beams that were once perhaps part of a roof.
[290:10.22]A single upright forms the body and head.
[290:12.13]Its two arms are angled outwards to collect starlight.
[290:15.23]It has clearly been positioned beneath the stars of Hyatt, Osiris, Osiris, and Thara, and angled so the resulting fireball is directed at the staircase.
[290:24.05]A new fireball begins to form between the arms of the Grimalkin.
[290:29.69]Make a move.
[290:33.54]Yeah, I'm going up.
[290:34.60]Run for the stairs.
[290:36.66]You watch the Grimalkin carefully, getting ready to time your run up the staircase.
[290:40.70]Another fireball is released and explodes up the staircase.
[290:43.28]You move quickly to the base of the staircase, ready to climb.
[290:46.93]Move.
[290:48.01]Then it's time to run.
[290:48.99]Go.
[290:51.01]You rush headlong into the despairing fire of the previous fireball.
[290:56.29]Its heat is so intense it knocks you back.
[290:57.85]Fuck.
[290:58.07]Fuck.
[291:00.39]The flames of the last fireball boil up a way upwards.
[291:03.27]Wait.
[291:05.13]He's gonna do a new fireball.
[291:07.35]Go.
[291:09.01]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[291:12.12]The fireball is almost complete.
[291:13.90]There's no shelter on the staircase.
[291:15.20]Go, go, go, go.
[291:16.22]Move, move, move, move, move.
[291:17.10]Climb, climb, climb.
[291:19.66]You reach the top of the staircase.
[291:21.62]There's a closed hatch above you sealed with a bolt.
[291:23.69]Fuck.
[291:24.19]The fireball whips across the floor of the tower and begins to boil up the stairs.
[291:28.11]Open the bolt.
[291:28.83]Open the bolt.
[291:32.69]Your fingers go for the bolt at the top of the hatch just as the fireball strikes.
[291:36.44]The flames envelop you and you cry out in agony.
[291:39.64]The impact knocks you from the stairs and back to fucking destroy this thing.
[291:45.47]Fucking cast a spell.
[291:46.83]I'm going to crush this thing.
[291:55.28]No, that'll kill me.
[291:59.38]How do I counter fire?
[292:01.57]What's the fire counter spell?
[292:06.77]Create an invisible wall.
[292:08.67]Pray to the goddamn elephant, whatever it is, the whale.
[292:11.39]Give me some healing.
[292:11.99]Alright, I'm making a wall.
[292:19.14]I'm putting a wall in front of this thing.
[292:22.66]And I'm just gonna run up the damn stairs.
[292:26.32]That's three times in 30 minutes that you've been burnt.
[292:28.65]Wall.
[292:30.62]You turn the stars into shape around you, throwing up an invisible barrier in front of you.
[292:34.77]The wall cuts the tower in two and should protect you from the Grimalkin's fireballs.
[292:39.27]A new one is currently forming.
[292:41.71]Go.
[292:43.74]You hear the explosion from below and look down to see the Grimalkin has blown itself up.
[292:51.36]Good.
[292:51.88]I put a wall in front of it.
[292:53.07]It shot the wall and blew itself up.
[292:58.72]The tower bears another brass cylinder.
[293:00.86]Activate the beacon.
[293:02.22]We've seen this before.
[293:03.86]Let's see what it does.
[293:07.30]Oh boy, there's a hut there.
[293:08.70]We can go to this town.
[293:12.34]There's a big town up there.
[293:14.26]I'm going to put it right here on this town.
[293:23.07]I'm going to put it right here.
[293:27.81]Took a lot for you to outsmart that stationary pile of wood.
[293:30.44]Yeah, I know, right?
[293:34.28]Touch the blue crystal.
[293:35.02]I want to get a good look at the world right now.
[293:39.60]So I'm here.
[293:42.00]Is there... I can turn this one this way.
[293:44.15]This one there, I can turn them all.
[293:50.51]Go visit Felton.
[293:53.01]I'm actually, I'm shocked that the, um, my internet's still up.
[293:57.27]It's still going.
[293:58.89]I actually, I'm, I'm happy about this.
[294:02.16]Cause that means like, let's just say I started at seven, eight, nine, 10.
[294:06.10]That would have been three hours.
[294:08.56]So starting at five, like four 45, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[294:13.26]Well, what's the uptime?
[294:13.86]Has it been about five, five hours?
[294:17.17]Okay.
[294:17.61]This is the first time in like two and a half weeks that I've been able to do that.
[294:26.84]Tier 2 support.
[294:28.16]Really?
[294:28.66]I'm not sure.
[294:31.04]I'm not sure.
[294:32.66]But maybe that has something to do with it.
[294:37.38]Where did I get this stamina?
[294:40.89]Oh, it's because I touched the crystal.
[294:42.49]When you activate one of the beacons, you get a bunch of stamina.
[294:45.55]Because it fills you.
[294:47.93]It flushes you with all kinds of great energies.
[294:52.25]I think I'm going to stop here.
[294:56.43]Because it has been just about five hours now.
[295:00.68]And this was more of a test of anything else.
[295:04.94]Because going from starting at five...
[295:10.50]I don't know.
[295:14.00]We'll have to see if I start at seven next week.
[295:24.19]Touch my crystal and fill me with all kinds of great energy.
[295:30.70]And also, my voice is starting to get a little hairy.
[295:34.96]I'm not sure if you can tell.
[295:36.98]But I've been just doing straight up reading a novel for five hours.
[295:44.28]Yeah, we'll see.
[295:44.89]I'm glad that it was able to go for five hours.
[295:47.47]I'm happy that it worked out this way.
[295:52.27]I was really, really concerned about this, but thankfully it didn't go down and it's still able to run.
[295:59.84]So maybe they did actually go up to like tier two support and figure out what the hell was going on.
[296:07.27]But yeah, that's going to wrap it up.
[296:08.99]We're going to stop here.
[296:09.59]That's next week.
[296:12.51]I'm not going to play sorcery next week.
[296:14.82]We're going to do something else.
[296:17.09]We're going to come back to sorcery.
[296:19.11]This is a good chunk of part three.
[296:20.91]I would say I'm probably a little bit more than halfway through part three.
[296:23.31]It's probably 60%, 65% of the way through.
[296:26.83]There's a part four.
[296:28.57]Part four actually came out like two weeks ago.
[296:33.57]So it just came out.
[296:37.47]Stream didn't crash because we removed the curse of Lorag.
[296:40.36]That is so oddly funny how that's true.
[296:44.16]Fucking Lorag was crashing the stream.
[296:49.19]But yeah, thanks everybody for sticking around.
[296:51.58]Thanks for hanging out.
[296:53.22]If you stayed up late, then thanks for staying up.
[296:56.20]And I will catch you guys on Tuesday.
[296:59.58]A new video is going to go up.
[297:00.93]Well, not really new if you watch the stream of it, but my second channel is going to have a video tomorrow.
[297:07.37]So you can watch that.
[297:09.55]And yeah.
[297:11.70]Have a good night, guys.
[297:12.74]Thank you so much to all the support over the last few days.
[297:15.46]I have not been able to do a legitimate goodbye on one of these streams.
[297:20.30]So, good night.
[297:21.76]Goodbye, everybody.
[297:22.56]Thank you so much for all the new subs, all the resubs, everybody, all the bits.
[297:26.80]You guys are all fucking awesome.
[297:28.37]Thank you so much.
[297:29.65]I will see you dudes on Tuesday.
[297:31.25]We're going to play a different game.
[297:33.03]I'm going to put another poll in the chat on Tuesday.
[297:36.99]And we will see what you guys want to see.
[297:39.63]So good night.
[297:40.81]Good luck.
[297:41.70]Have a good one, guys.
[297:42.76]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[297:45.57]Bye-bye.
