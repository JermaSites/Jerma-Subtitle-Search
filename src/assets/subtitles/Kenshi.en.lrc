[00:01.67]Hi there.
[00:04.92]Welcome.
[00:07.86]Hope everybody's having a good post-Christmas, post-holiday here.
[00:14.94]Relaxation day.
[00:19.00]Do have New Year's coming up in just a few days, but I had a good Christmas.
[00:30.82]I did some FaceTime with the family, which is always good.
[00:36.57]Yeah, I miss them.
[00:40.99]But, it was fun.
[00:43.87]The house here, I decided to give a few gifts to each other.
[00:48.68]Pretty wholesome day, and then I just sat on the couch, watched TV, and played video games.
[00:55.70]And ate snacks.
[00:57.64]It was pretty much my whole day.
[01:03.46]So today, into tonight, we are going to play this game called Kenshi.
[01:12.83]This is a game about survival.
[01:16.21]It's like a wasteland kind of survival game.
[01:21.27]That has top-down RTS, RPG, hybrid, squad-based... There's a whole lot of crazy shit that can happen in this game.
[01:28.92]So I figured I would give it a try.
[01:32.75]This game is going to be too hard for you.
[01:35.57]That's fine.
[01:37.75]I did read a few things about it.
[01:42.00]This game is designed for you to just lose.
[01:45.96]So... By its very design choices, you're supposed to fucking lose.
[01:54.27]You can read?
[01:55.03]Yeah, I just learned!
[01:59.92]I got this book, How to Read.
[02:01.58]And I started at the beginning, and now I finished the book and I can read.
[02:09.88]But, give me one second.
[02:11.08]We'll get started.
[02:12.26]I got the game ready to go.
[02:13.11]I just need to grab one thing.
[02:16.41]See you in two seconds.
[03:06.41]But how did you read the book that taught you how to read?
[03:08.38]I read it.
[03:10.06]It was very easy at first.
[03:12.52]Starting off each page, it's about a four to five hundred page book.
[03:17.16]And the first page is just big symbols of animals.
[03:23.79]And, you know, I know what that is.
[03:25.35]It shows you an elephant.
[03:26.29]I know that's what an elephant is.
[03:28.37]And then you turn the next page and there's an E there.
[03:31.07]It's a giant E.
[03:33.58]So, okay, I know what E is.
[03:35.29]I know what the letter E is.
[03:36.57]And the next page, it shows the elephant again, and it puts E-L.
[03:43.63]And then by the time you get to chapter 10, you know in appliances what they are, and how to call them what they are.
[03:53.52]At the end of the book, the Great Gatsby is in the book.
[03:57.14]They just put it at the end.
[03:59.32]So eventually you get there and you can read the Great Gatsby.
[04:01.85]It's really cool.
[04:06.93]Let's get started, what do you say?
[04:09.79]Let's turn this music on, turn this off, and here is Kenshi.
[04:19.48]So, I don't really know much about this, all I know is it's gonna be fucking hard, and it's gonna be a difficult video game.
[04:25.74]But it should be fun as a character creator, and you know how much I love those things.
[04:29.56]So, let's go to the new game.
[04:32.56]Alright, uh, choose your beginning.
[04:34.94]Wanderer.
[04:36.46]Nobodies.
[04:37.52]Wanderer.
[04:38.20]The Wandering Traitor.
[04:39.46]The Holy Sword.
[04:40.79]The Cannibal Hunter.
[04:42.65]The Hive Exile.
[04:44.27]Son of a Captain.
[04:46.03]The Slaves.
[04:47.55]Rock Bottom.
[04:49.53]Empire Citizen.
[04:50.95]Holy Nation Citizen.
[04:52.39]Guy with a Dog.
[04:54.90]Okay, I kind of like Guy with a Dog.
[05:01.07]Okay, difficulty is normal.
[05:03.71]I have, uh... I have a source on Wikipedia for the amount of money that I have.
[05:10.23]And the playstyle is RPG.
[05:11.56]A homeless and hungry drifter rescues an abandoned puppy.
[05:14.80]It seems pretty useless.
[05:16.00]Maybe he will just eat it.
[05:18.32]Holy shit, that's... I don't know if I want to eat a dog.
[05:22.84]Okay, um... I don't think I want to eat a dog, but... What else we got?
[05:27.61]RPG, RPG... What are these other playstyles?
[05:31.34]Action RPG.
[05:32.58]Difficulty dodgy.
[05:35.32]I seriously regret coming into cannibal territory.
[05:37.42]This is a stupid idea.
[05:38.46]Warning.
[05:39.40]You will be attacked immediately upon game start.
[05:41.75]Not recommended for a first time play.
[05:46.47]This is hard.
[05:47.57]I'm not ready for the hard stuff.
[05:48.87]The Wandering Trader.
[05:52.17]No, I don't want to do a trading RPG.
[05:57.69]Nobody's easy... Easy and hard combination.
[06:03.04]I'm not going to... Rock bottom.
[06:05.27]You've hit absolute rock bottom.
[06:07.17]You are alone, unarmed, naked, and hungry.
[06:09.49]Lost in the middle of a harsh desert, teeming with slavers, and you just lost an arm.
[06:13.51]Good luck.
[06:16.28]You want me to start here.
[06:20.64]I've never played this game before.
[06:22.20]You want me to start here.
[06:26.06]We can only go up from here.
[06:27.41]Alright, fine.
[06:28.67]Advanced options.
[06:29.47]Hunger time.
[06:30.21]I'm not going to mess with any of these.
[06:34.00]Yeah, alright, here we go.
[06:39.92]Okay.
[06:41.88]This is called Rock Bottom.
[06:46.72]Heavy inventory will slow you down, but it's a good way... to... Hold the middle mouse to rotate the guy.
[06:55.30]I have to make my character!
[07:00.38]Create your first character.
[07:01.50]Use the confirm button when finished.
[07:03.72]Yeah, but I don't... Alright, idle stance.
[07:10.46]We can make him golem.
[07:14.90]Straight up standing.
[07:21.93]I kind of want number two.
[07:25.37]I like this one.
[07:29.68]I know everybody's going to want me to do this one.
[07:34.08]I'm going to go with this one.
[07:36.94]This is fine.
[07:38.84]Height.
[07:42.86]Just make a stretched out guy.
[07:44.70]I'm just going to make a squid.
[07:52.04]Alright, so posture.
[08:02.32]Human bow and arrow.
[08:04.20]Alright.
[08:05.24]No, that's too extreme.
[08:06.54]Okay, I already love this game and I haven't even played it.
[08:19.34]Alright, but how do I... Shoulder set.
[08:22.01]There's so much here.
[08:22.83]What do you think?
[08:28.55]All the way back?
[08:31.27]Or all the way... No, we'll just do this.
[08:33.35]Oh, I got a really bad nerd neck and all.
[08:37.54]I gotta change this.
[08:38.96]Leg length.
[08:41.00]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:42.70]Wait a minute.
[08:45.12]I like this one, because this is just realistic enough.
[08:49.68]Shoulders set.
[08:50.30]I'm gonna say tight together.
[08:54.63]Yeah, down like this.
[08:58.83]Neck position, let's see.
[09:06.04]Bird.
[09:12.94]How could you- You can't have a fully side- Can you make a- If you're the developer of this game, can you make a wrestling game?
[09:18.21]You know what I mean?
[09:19.95]Like, do you have the necessary resources to make a wrestling game?
[09:26.51]Alright.
[09:28.13]Uh, leg length.
[09:32.00]Let's go with this one.
[09:34.93]He's gonna be really tall.
[09:36.79]Shoulders tight together.
[09:40.63]Arm bulk.
[09:44.65]Oh my lord.
[09:53.03]Hands.
[09:53.76]You gotta have big hands.
[09:55.68]No, huge hands is too easy.
[09:57.08]Tiny hands.
[09:58.72]Does this affect how hard I punch?
[10:04.30]Chest.
[10:08.30]No, we're just making a seahorse.
[10:09.92]Um, bring it down.
[10:16.82]Stomach.
[10:19.52]No.
[10:22.91]How tall is this- how tall is he?
[10:25.03]I don't even know how tall- this guy's like nine feet tall.
[10:39.35]Just give him, like, a big diaper ass.
[10:45.45]Alright.
[10:46.35]Leg shape.
[10:48.78]You either have him top heavy or bottom heavy.
[10:54.22]That looks pretty good.
[10:55.22]Any more?
[10:55.76]Okay, there's feet.
[10:59.50]Those feet are fine.
[11:02.40]Alright, face.
[11:04.82]Holy shit.
[11:06.59]Oh, boy.
[11:07.19]Okay.
[11:08.79]This... Look at all this.
[11:14.31]Really... Ugh.
[11:24.34]Neck... Ugh, you could do... It looks like somebody's arm is up in a sock.
[11:33.30]This is a sock puppet person.
[11:38.97]Neck width.
[11:42.36]This is just unsettling, is what it is.
[11:44.00]Neck length.
[11:46.30]Could be even longer than that.
[11:50.14]Jaw.
[11:53.66]Cheekbones.
[11:54.46]I guess we could go this way.
[12:04.14]You can go either with... Oh, he just looks like Greg House.
[12:12.33]Wilson, I, uh, you know.
[12:15.21]I can't do Dr. House.
[12:16.85]Maybe I can.
[12:18.67]No, I can't.
[12:24.12]Is there a character named Wilson in the game?
[12:27.84]Not the game, in the show?
[12:34.34]Yeah, there is.
[12:34.72]Okay.
[12:34.86]That looks alright.
[12:39.46]Arch.
[12:39.84]Let's see.
[12:43.52]Oh, dear.
[12:44.02]Oh, dear.
[13:03.00]This guy's not gonna survive?
[13:04.53]You say that, just wait till he does.
[13:14.99]What's the, uh... What's that animal from?
[13:18.47]What's the Ice Age character?
[13:21.19]The squirrel?
[13:28.35]No, not the Grinch.
[13:31.15]Definitely has to have kind of mad eyes.
[13:33.18]Yeah, that's sad and surprised.
[13:36.16]This is very upset.
[13:38.62]No, not that upset.
[13:39.40]That's a little too much for me.
[13:42.98]Gonna have his eyes bugging out of his head.
[13:49.97]Now he's very concerned.
[13:51.15]That's good.
[13:51.69]Mmm.
[13:56.75]Tooth?
[13:57.15]No, right there's alright.
[14:01.67]It's kind of got the Homer Simpson.
[14:02.87]Alright.
[14:08.19]No, that looks alright.
[14:11.34]Eye height.
[14:13.12]Aye yi yi.
[14:13.60]Alright, do we want him to have more face or more head?
[14:20.40]I think more head.
[14:26.20]Didn't you already make this video?
[14:28.94]Yeah, but the only difference is there are no mods on this.
[14:32.58]Eye size.
[14:33.16]This is just straight up out of the box.
[14:41.05]Oh, man, lookit.
[14:41.87]You can go all the way in.
[14:44.85]What do you think?
[14:45.53]In?
[14:46.15]Uh, in.
[14:46.59]Yeah, it's gotta be in.
[14:51.52]It's that.
[14:52.24]Alright.
[14:52.80]Wait, uh, hold on.
[14:53.44]I... This other... What the fuck?!
[14:58.26]Wait, hold on!
[14:59.00]There's so... There's so many creatures!
[15:03.50]Why did I not know this existed?
[15:13.48]So, this is the best game ever.
[15:24.41]You're telling me that I can make other... Okay, hold on.
[15:27.48]Go back, go back, go back, go back, go back.
[15:28.96]This is really important.
[15:34.79]He's gone.
[15:35.35]Are you sure about that?
[15:48.98]That was very surprising.
[15:52.22]He's fine.
[15:54.14]Oh no, I can't have a guy be a butterfly.
[15:58.04]Shouldn't he be a butterfly?
[16:00.38]Alright, guy, butterfly.
[16:06.20]He's the contortionist.
[16:07.20]This guy's gonna be on, like, America's Got Talent and try to fit himself into a box.
[16:16.14]Okay.
[16:18.20]It can't be this.
[16:18.90]That's too much.
[16:22.41]He has to at least be able to stand.
[16:23.81]Okay.
[16:25.49]So, there are... Look at... Did you see how many people I can make?
[16:28.99]Alright, perfect.
[16:32.57]Hair.
[16:33.13]Hair.
[16:37.44]Hair.
[16:37.90]Haircut 4.
[16:40.78]I don't want to see any others.
[16:41.70]I don't think I should see any others.
[16:51.17]I don't want to change it, but I kind of have to.
[16:53.93]Let's do it.
[16:54.35]Okay, hold on.
[16:54.83]What about beards?
[17:05.71]Hmm.
[17:24.49]No, it has to be the... It has to be that one little swoop over.
[17:31.01]That's it.
[17:31.67]Forty... What was it, like six or seven?
[17:41.88]He just looks like any... currently airing... animated 3D... boss... of the main character.
[17:54.51]In all those, like, 3D animated shows that are currently airing, this is, like, the character's boss.
[18:00.23]Always.
[18:00.55]Okay.
[18:08.79]Uh, beard.
[18:09.59]There's a lot of beard options, so hold on.
[18:12.60]I love how this is just pasted on right here.
[18:17.36]That's clearly a fake beard.
[18:20.98]No, that's too easy.
[18:26.47]That's too easy, too.
[18:27.75]I mean, this is so easy, right?
[18:35.85]But I gotta get rid of that.
[18:38.27]The way it was before.
[18:45.12]That's actually not bad.
[18:48.14]Oh, you can do different hair color, okay.
[19:07.84]Joker no, I can't make them like a YouTuber There there we go This is okay, this is like what happens when you dye your hair too many times I
[19:28.35]Okay.
[19:29.31]That looks good.
[19:30.07]I think that's good.
[19:32.61]Confirm.
[19:34.61]Primarily from farmer cultures, they still tend to be an aggressive race and are easily led astray.
[19:39.35]The worst of them live in ignorance, knowing only greed and fear, reacting to anything different with hatred and violence.
[19:44.99]But the best of them are some of the greatest civilized scientists, engineers, and warriors in the land.
[19:49.10]Humans.
[19:51.84]Okay.
[19:55.22]What is that?
[20:00.13]I think we got our character.
[20:02.05]I'm ready.
[20:03.45]Confirm.

[20:21.61]Okay, to zoom, use the mouse scroll.
[20:24.71]Okay.
[20:26.27]Where am I supposed to go?
[20:29.59]I'm actually in the middle of the desert.

[22:22.02]Alright, what is this?
[22:22.76]Athletics XP.
[22:23.76]This is the rate at which your athletic skill is increasing while running.
[22:28.77]Cool.

[22:57.57]Stat penalty is at times 88.
[23:00.67]88.
[23:00.89]Okay.
[23:03.97]So now what?
[23:05.79]No jobs.
[23:06.77]To add jobs, hold shift when giving an order.
[23:08.52]Alright, continue.
[23:11.76]This shows the selected character's current health condition.
[23:13.50]Yeah, I figured that out.
[23:15.26]The arrow buttons allow you to pause and fast forward the game speed.
[23:21.94]Pause.
[23:22.94]Got it.
[23:26.89]Okay.
[23:28.11]That's actually pretty cool.
[23:29.94]So this is just like The Sims, but in a wasteland.
[23:31.96]This is awesome.
[23:34.96]Here you'll find your character's current funds and the in-game time and date.
[23:40.10]Nothing.
[23:42.83]And, uh, this is the day and the time.
[23:48.63]Okay.
[23:50.09]This opens the build menu.
[23:51.53]There's a build menu?
[23:54.72]Here you can place buildings and start your own outpost anywhere in the world.
[23:59.46]But you should choose a safe area and check availability of resources using the prospect button.
[24:04.91]You will also need building materials to finish construction.
[24:12.27]Okay, so I need to prospect something first.
[24:17.27]Buildings.
[24:20.44]Small shack.
[24:25.65]Building material?
[24:26.55]What do I have for building?
[24:27.75]Am I just gonna make like a fucking trash box?
[24:37.41]Should I just build a fucking cube?
[24:42.80]No, no, that's a bad place for that.
[24:45.24]It's in the middle of the desert.
[24:46.08]I can't even get running water out there.
[24:47.50]Alright.
[24:48.28]That's the build menu.
[24:49.08]Here you can open your inventory, uh... What is it?
[24:52.72]I'm in the build menu.
[24:54.34]Shit, I gotta get out of the build menu.
[24:56.97]Uh... Out.
[24:58.21]Okay.
[25:00.17]Here you can open your inventory, skills, statistics, world map, tech, and squad management.
[25:04.09]For tips and tutorials, make sure to check out the help menu at the very bottom.
[25:09.34]Characters inventory.
[25:10.34]Oh, this is so cool.
[25:13.04]Limbs.
[25:15.06]Well, that's what I'm holding on my arms.
[25:17.84]Total weight.
[25:19.90]Disguise.
[25:20.66]Okay.
[25:24.64]Status window.
[25:28.36]Toughness.
[25:29.70]Max carry weight.
[25:30.96]Dexterity.
[25:34.50]Alright.
[25:35.72]This is a lot.
[25:36.20]Look it up.
[25:36.72]This is a multiple world map.
[25:38.84]What?! !
[25:43.65]What's that noise?
[25:45.09]I'm paused, right?
[25:51.41]Dude, this is bigger than Northrend.
[25:55.53]Okay, there's a city over here.
[25:57.87]Shobotai is over here.
[25:59.17]I gotta make it over to this city, I'm assuming.
[26:06.13]Okay, well, there's a couple cities.
[26:07.31]There's... Bark, Shobotai, Heft, and Stroat.
[26:16.62]Okay.
[26:18.60]Faction.
[26:20.35]Dust bandits.
[26:21.09]Slave hunters.
[26:21.91]Research.
[26:22.97]Crafting.
[26:24.33]How to research squads.
[26:25.81]Dialog.
[26:30.09]What?
[26:33.47]What was that dialog?
[26:36.69]Alright.
[26:37.41]I'm gonna make it to... Okay, I got the basics down.
[26:42.09]This shows the jobs and orders for the selected character.
[26:46.28]Jobs.
[26:46.92]No jobs.
[26:47.40]The job is make it to the city.
[26:51.52]Your character is hungry, missing a limb.
[26:53.18]What do I do?
[26:54.88]There is no linear story or mission to guide you in Kenshi.
[26:57.63]Be a traitor, a thief, a bounty hunter, a farmer, or even a warlord.
[27:00.85]You'll need to explore the world and find your own adventure.
[27:04.23]Tap the M key.
[27:05.21]You can use the world map to navigate and find nearby towns or points of interest.
[27:09.96]So M, right?
[27:12.10]Here's the K. Oops.
[27:17.51]There we go.
[27:19.47]It's a true open world.
[27:23.25]First things first, you need food and funds to survive.
[27:25.32]To get started, you can either scavenge the outlands for loot, mine valuable materials from iron ore vans, or you can even resort to thievery after nightfall.
[27:32.76]To cash in your loot, you need to find a store.
[27:35.10]Use the map to navigate to a nearby town and find shops.
[27:38.17]Surviving alone in the world of Kenshi won't be easy, but hiring new recruits will help.
[27:41.91]Check the town bars for mercs, or buy animal companions from any of the farms outside town.
[27:47.65]Remember, you're not special, and you're not stronger than anyone else.
[27:51.33]Train hard, pick your fights wisely, and don't be afraid to run like crazy.
[27:56.86]Alright.
[27:58.80]What do you say?
[27:59.94]Huh?
[28:00.04]Huh?
[28:01.40]I'm ready to get started.
[28:02.94]Let's just go find a town.
[28:04.18]You know what I mean?
[28:07.62]Let's go... Let's go!
[28:08.70]Wait, could you guys even hear that?
[28:09.64]Yeah, you could.
[28:10.06]Alright, let's go.
[28:32.23]Do it again.
[28:32.69]I'm not gonna do it.
[28:33.69]What's that?
[28:34.13]What's that?
[28:34.51]There's something over here.
[28:39.10]Are these all other people waiting to... If you don't know anybody, I'd say these guys look like escaped slaves.
[28:53.69]Wait, hold on.
[28:55.57]Should I run?
[28:58.79]Knock him out and sell him to the slavers.
[29:00.41]How do I run faster?
[29:01.43]How do I punch?
[29:03.51]Holy fuck, that guy just did a full baseball swing.
[29:05.55]Where do I have to run to?
[29:09.24]What the fuck?
[29:10.28]Wait, why?
[29:11.02]How do I get out of here?
[29:16.56]Is there a jump?
[29:22.61]There has to be a punch, right?
[29:24.47]Punch.
[29:28.82]Alright, attack.
[29:36.03]Attack!
[29:38.57]Oh my god, run.
[29:53.51]I don't even know... I'm not... This guy has sneakers on.
[29:56.75]How am I supposed to fight this guy?
[30:03.65]Is he gonna kill me?
[30:05.31]What happens if you die?
[30:06.11]This guy's not very good.
[30:20.96]Okay, am I going the right way?
[30:21.96]I'm just gonna make it to the town.
[30:25.42]I'm not gonna change anything.
[30:26.54]I'm just gonna run this way until I get to the town.
[30:28.99]Ow.
[30:34.98]God damn it.
[30:35.66]Where's my health?
[30:41.39]I'm going the wrong way.
[30:43.05]Quick!
[30:43.39]Bang a left.
[30:50.86]Come on!
[30:51.74]Where is the town?
[30:57.08]I'm not close to a town.
[31:03.56]I'm so far away from this place.
[31:12.23]Chest, stomach, l- okay, my- I still got a pretty good head on my shoulders though.
[31:21.47]This is actually kind of brutal, there's nothing I can do about this.
[31:29.02]Don't fuck with us.
[31:32.34]I didn't.
[31:32.80]You came after me.
[31:37.36]Naked dude has been enslaved.
[31:43.98]Jobs.
[31:44.62]Obedient slave.
[31:55.01]Uh, alright.
[32:00.31]So do I get up?
[32:06.70]What is he doing to me?
[32:12.67]He's been doing this for a really long time.
[32:19.53]Your character is hung.
[32:20.15]You need food to survive.
[32:21.11]You can grow food, buy it, hunt it, or steal it.
[32:24.23]Your squad will automatically eat whatever food is in their inventory.
[32:27.02]So am I getting brought into a squad?
[32:31.00]He's healing me.
[32:32.06]This guy just let me in his squad.
[32:35.89]Alright, you appear to be missing a limb.
[32:37.03]Limbs are useful things to have, so you may want to get that replaced.
[32:39.73]You can buy various robotic limbs.
[32:42.48]Okay, install new limbs using the robotics.
[32:46.32]Robotic limbs require skeleton repair kits.
[32:48.18]Okay.
[32:49.46]He actually is healing me.
[32:50.50]This is great.
[32:53.04]Building gates and walls.
[32:54.10]When building walls, you need to be careful not to place them facing inside out.
[32:56.85]The arrows you see show the outside facing direction.
[33:01.15]You can use the and buttons to rotate before placing them.
[33:05.00]As with other buildings, you can only place them when they glow green.
[33:07.32]Yep, once you're happy, left-click to set it down.
[33:09.28]You got it.
[33:10.68]What the fuck?
[33:18.65]How do I, like, keep centered on myself?
[33:28.57]So where is their camp?
[33:34.13]Double-click your icon.
[33:35.13]Okay, there we go.
[33:38.93]Right, well... He folded me up.
[33:42.07]Like a blanket.
[33:43.66]I guess we're just gonna be with this guy now.
[33:45.26]Okay.
[33:46.54]Uh, fine.
[33:46.88]I'll just read tutorials while you walk me around.
[33:48.56]That's good.
[33:49.40]Welcome to build mode!
[33:50.56]Uh, boo yep.
[33:51.16]Select a building.
[33:51.80]You can get a... Building a small shack will allow you to build a research bench.
[33:57.35]That's $50.
[33:57.79]That came in by... And I can't even see because the text is so small.
[34:01.11]I don't know what I did.
[34:02.27]Something from the Christmas Eve stream.
[34:06.65]I'm unconscious.
[34:10.90]Well, look at... At least we're going 12 miles per hour.
[34:13.42]This guy can run pretty fast.
[34:16.84]But, first of all, thank you to Soupset for the $50.
[34:21.93]Happy late Christmas, big boy.
[34:23.37]Thank you.
[34:24.97]You as well.
[34:26.27]Thank you so much for the $50.
[34:27.01]Wait, hold on, wait, hold on.
[34:31.20]I gotta pay attention.
[34:33.97]Wait, is he just catching up with me?
[34:36.87]We're just catching up with the other people.
[34:43.94]What is that?
[34:44.78]Don't trip over that.
[34:49.10]Those are his buddies.
[34:50.28]Yeah, this is the squad!
[34:52.32]Hey, what's up guys?
[34:54.12]Yeah, I'm the new squad member.
[35:12.95]I'm not really doing anything, am I?
[35:23.53]Just pretend it's an online game.
[35:28.42]Doesn't this happen in some of these online RPGs?
[35:36.87]Alright, building a shack will allow you to build a research bench inside.
[35:38.85]You can learn new tech-news-new.
[35:41.61]Choose where to place a building on the terrain.
[35:43.33]Yes, yes, yes.
[35:43.93]Rotate the position using the and keys.
[35:46.47]Select squad members and right click the construction to begin adding materials if they have them.
[35:50.39]Right.
[35:52.33]Much quicker depending on the number.
[35:53.45]Just like in Warcraft, the more orcs you put on the building, the more they can build it.
[35:58.21]How to craft.
[35:58.84]You are injured.
[35:59.58]You are under attack.
[36:01.49]Use the spacebar to pause the action.
[36:02.79]This will give you some time to think and plan your next step.
[36:05.33]When you're outnumbered, it may be best to jump, ship, and flee.
[36:07.75]If you choose to flee, right-click on the terrain to move your character.
[36:11.55]Make sure you have your character selected.
[36:13.53]If you do choose to stand and fight, select your squad members, hold right-click on the target enemy, and select attack target.
[36:19.98]OT attack all from the interaction menu.
[36:23.46]Just right-clicking on an enemy when the cursor is red also gives you an attack order.
[36:27.30]Okay, that's what I thought.
[36:31.33]You can select more specific combat modes from the right side command menu.
[36:35.79]Block focuses on defense over attack.
[36:38.13]Passive focuses on non-combat.
[36:40.59]Chases focuses on chasing down enemies.
[36:43.23]Taunt focuses on drawing enemy attacks.
[36:47.11]You've been enslaved!
[36:48.19]You can either live out the rest of your life as a slave, or you can break free and escape.
[36:52.33]Your character will automatically behave obediently to their master.
[36:55.49]If you want to escape, you'll need to dismiss the obedient slave auto job by pressing the X.
[37:10.83]Okay, let's go!
[37:11.77]I'm out!
[37:14.61]You can then hold right-click on your character to bring up the interaction menu and unlock your shackles to escape.
[37:22.10]Careful, even if you escape successfully, you're branded a slave.
[37:25.04]Oh, I'm unconscious.
[37:35.76]Just unlock your shackles.
[37:37.31]Alright, I think we gotta...
[37:38.67]You are KO'd.
[37:39.41]You've been knocked out.
[37:41.03]If seriously wounded, the unconscious status will change to dying, and the character won't get back up until healed by another character.
[37:46.41]If they don't get first aid in time, they'll eventually die, which is what we saw.
[37:50.10]Even after healing, a character will need time to recover before regaining consciousness.
[37:54.98]Particularly bad injuries will enter the character into a recovery coma until their vitals have... What the fuck is happening?
[38:03.87]Is he using me as a weapon?
[38:08.70]Come on, it's a jailbreak!
[38:15.34]Get him!
[38:18.06]Is there animals?
[38:19.16]What is this, like a pig dog?
[38:22.90]Come on, come on.
[38:23.88]Break free, break free.
[38:28.29]Come on!
[38:30.63]Where did the dog just go?
[38:33.27]That guy went up into the sky, apparently.
[38:42.64]Who is this powerful?
[38:44.36]They did it!
[38:44.86]They saved me!
[38:46.70]Thanks for the rescue!
[38:52.37]Hello?
[39:03.40]Uh... Hello?
[39:11.16]You know, check, I'm still alive down here.
[39:13.70]I could use some help.
[39:22.18]What was the point of that?
[39:23.14]So this is just another army of raiders.
[39:27.05]What are these?
[39:28.65]Okay, hold on, I'll... I'm still, I'm gonna be just fine.
[39:39.35]This is perfect, okay.
[39:43.25]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, why are they getting up?
[39:47.04]Why are they getting up?
[39:50.40]No, no, just don't come get me, come on!
[39:55.28]He's running.
[39:55.66]I think this is the perfect opportunity.
[39:58.80]No, they're looting each other.
[40:04.25]No...
[40:11.03]I really don't understand.
[40:11.99]They're looting the dead bodies.
[40:14.54]Are they just gonna forget that I exist, right?
[40:16.90]Because I'm technically unconscious.
[40:25.04]1700 more seconds.
[40:31.28]No, they're healing each other.
[40:34.31]Something's going on over here.
[40:35.23]Uh, that doesn't look like it's very appealing.
[40:44.64]Alright, they're gonna forget about me.
[40:45.52]Let's fast forward.
[40:47.60]Sixteen hundred... Oh, hold on.
[40:51.34]Yup.
[40:51.80]Wait, what'd he say?
[40:52.28]Wow, wow?
[40:53.00]Wow!
[40:53.40]What'd he say?
[40:57.54]Walk right over me, come on.
[40:58.50]Oh my fucking god.
[41:06.03]It's like it never happened.
[41:12.01]Is this dangerous?
[41:15.85]I feel like these sandstorms are dangerous.
[41:23.21]Well, I got another 1600 seconds.
[41:36.10]What?
[41:36.64]Wait.
[41:37.42]Why is there a giant bug?
[41:39.12]Hold on a second.
[41:40.66]Get off of this.
[41:42.24]Hold on.
[41:43.98]What is this?
[41:50.17]Put me down!
[41:54.45]Why are you just standing there with my body?
[42:04.53]Where did I go?
[42:18.37]Why am I still bouncing around?
[42:22.18]And with my daring escape!
[42:29.26]Did they kill it?
[42:34.45]No!
[42:34.95]How did you kill this thing?
[42:40.13]Can I please just get to a town?
[42:45.13]How much more time do I have?
[42:46.27]14 hundred seconds.
[42:55.58]They forgot about me.
[42:57.54]This is my perfect opportunity to lie here and just be dead.
[43:00.92]They don't care about me.
[43:01.70]I went too far.
[43:02.34]They forgot.
[43:02.88]They thought I died.
[43:04.34]Perfect.
[43:08.86]Don't remember.
[43:09.90]Come on.
[43:10.40]Just keep going that way.
[43:12.46]No, no, no, no, no!
[43:16.37]No!
[43:18.77]Just walk by my body, don't come over here.
[43:23.65]It's too dusty, you can't even see anyways.
[43:25.37]I think we're in the clear.
[43:35.04]I just have to sit here for 1300 seconds.
[43:41.16]Alright.
[43:45.16]We'll make our escape very soon.
[43:46.70]I can unlock my shackles.
[43:48.74]Nobody around, right?
[43:49.96]No giant bugs?
[43:53.37]Alright, here we go.
[43:55.97]I just need to wait this out.
[43:58.69]And then I'm gonna eat that bug.
[44:03.86]I can eat the bug, right?
[44:09.06]Bug is back up.
[44:18.70]How can I... I can't eat that.
[44:19.96]Can I eat some of these things?
[44:24.16]The bug's not going to see me if I stand up.
[44:26.47]What's, like, the view distance?
[44:31.33]I think the bug died.
[44:35.13]Is it dead?
[44:37.91]Wounded.
[44:40.74]Blood, head.
[44:42.76]It's slowly getting worse.
[44:43.96]Okay, this bug is...
[44:50.18]Oh, dear.
[44:51.94]Okay, hold on.
[45:00.62]I'm not food, right?
[45:07.71]I don't think so.
[45:16.33]This is a long time to be unconscious.
[45:20.73]It's gonna be cold.
[45:27.30]And I need to get to the town.
[45:28.40]I'm gonna try... I gotta zoom out.
[45:37.28]So much dust everywhere.
[45:38.46]There's the bug.
[45:40.48]I gotta have a game plan when I get up.
[45:52.66]This feels... I think you would be dead by now, wouldn't you?
[46:07.65]If you were unconscious out here for this long, what's a bug fighting?
[46:12.74]Some more raiders.
[46:25.32]I need to see the map.
[46:26.68]I'm so close to this town.
[46:29.65]I can put a waypoint here.
[46:31.89]I'm just going to bang right a little bit and straight.
[46:34.69]It's down there.
[46:35.35]It's right there.
[46:39.18]Okay.
[46:39.86]I just got to get to the town.
[46:43.06]Only like five sped up minutes before I can get over there.
[46:54.78]Can this sandstorm let up so I can see?
[47:11.60]Almost there, okay.
[47:13.06]Hold on, take a look around.
[47:20.80]I don't see anything.
[47:22.32]I'm just gonna make a beeline for the town.
[47:32.73]200 seconds.
[47:34.57]I gotta get food.
[47:35.31]I gotta get to work.
[47:37.45]I gotta get armor.
[47:45.16]I need money.
[47:45.76]Alright, here we go.
[47:51.38]There's a band over here.
[47:54.37]Alright, I'm actually kind of nervous because this is the first time I've had control in like 10 minutes.
[48:01.91]Almost 20 minutes without control.
[48:04.53]It's dark, too.
[48:05.15]I gotta wait.
[48:05.85]Okay, almost not... Almost conscious.
[48:10.15]It's morning.
[48:13.00]I'm okay.
[48:14.88]Here we go.
[48:17.62]3, 2, 1, wake up.
[48:21.94]Playing dead.
[48:23.32]If enemies are still nearby, a character might play dead in order to avoid further fighting.
[48:28.35]To get up, right-click to move just to make sure there are no enemies around.
[48:33.26]Okay.
[48:33.48]Alright, get these off.
[48:36.79]Unlock shackles.
[48:39.47]I only have a 23% chance to get this off.
[48:43.17]Oh, man.
[48:45.73]Is the chance going down or up?
[48:47.83]It's going up.
[48:54.14]Does this use brain power?
[48:55.46]I don't think so.
[49:01.32]Oh, fuck.
[49:01.84]Here comes the bug.
[49:04.76]24% chance.
[49:05.36]Come on.
[49:05.62]That's one out of four.
[49:07.10]One out of five.
[49:08.82]I did it five times already.
[49:16.94]I'm getting skill up and lockpicking, though.
[49:20.82]What am I picking it with?
[49:24.52]Um... The sand.
[49:27.94]I'm filling the lock with sand and trying to smash it open.
[49:35.00]So I'm branded as an escaped slave.
[49:36.84]I'm gonna starve to death out here trying to get this off, aren't I?
[49:54.29]Oh, come on!
[49:55.55]Seriously?
[49:56.13]No, get up!
[49:58.43]Fight him!
[50:17.71]I'm alright.
[50:24.10]I got it!
[50:26.74]Get me out of here, come on!
[50:29.76]No, no, go this way!
[50:35.76]I can't run.
[50:36.56]I'm so fucked up.
[50:37.46]I need to get to this town.
[50:43.76]My left leg is destroyed.
[50:45.40]My chest is destroyed.
[50:48.26]I'm going so slow.
[50:51.46]I still have the shackles on.
[50:55.99]No, I don't.
[50:56.51]Do I?
[50:56.81]I don't have any first aid.
[51:04.99]Get there.
[51:06.47]Come on, shimmy, Grandpa.
[51:07.99]Let's go.
[51:11.55]I'm so close.
[51:12.19]I gotta go to the front gates.
[51:20.80]Inventory.
[51:21.70]Boots.
[51:22.32]Prisoner shackles.
[51:26.44]Are these armor?
[51:28.06]Heavy prisoner shackles.
[51:28.94]They stop you from running and doing a lot of things.
[51:30.68]They will trip you up in combat.
[51:32.16]They are locked on.
[51:33.08]You need to pick the lock somehow.
[51:35.02]But it can stop a sword.
[51:35.64]I'm good.
[51:44.17]Alright, run.
[51:45.27]That doesn't matter.
[51:47.13]I can't run.
[51:49.21]Do you see all my problems here?
[51:51.13]Do you see all my Sim problems?
[51:53.77]My chest, right arm, left leg, and hunger meter all have to go to the bathroom really bad.
[52:01.03]My chest is going to piss its pants in about 15 seconds.
[52:08.91]I'll get there.
[52:10.39]I don't see anybody.
[52:16.71]Although, I'm going out, kind of going the back door here.
[52:19.83]Wait, hold on, I see people here.
[52:22.53]What do I do?
[52:23.89]Towns.
[52:25.87]You've discovered your first town.
[52:27.06]Towns are perfect for stopping up on supplies and selling loot.
[52:30.72]To cash in your loot, you'll need to find a store or hold alt to show nearby shop signs.
[52:37.50]Okay.
[52:39.10]Uh, I don't have anything.
[52:42.78]Be wary of entering private buildings.
[52:44.38]Residents often don't like trespassers.
[52:46.04]You can find out whether a building is marked public or private by selecting the building.
[52:51.04]Also, most shops are closed at night.
[52:54.12]Let's get these out of the way here.
[52:55.68]Too much damage can result in a KO, crippling, and death.
[52:58.18]The green bars in the health panel show your health.
[53:00.16]The red bars show bleeding damage.
[53:02.53]Bleeding damage will need first aid.
[53:05.89]In order to heal, you need to get a first aid kit.
[53:08.09]You can buy or steal them from stores in town.
[53:11.70]You are injured too!
[53:13.91]To heal a character that you need first aid kit in your inventory, hold and right-click the target, then select first aid.
[53:19.95]From the menu, or simply right-click the heal icon over the injured person.
[53:24.93]Yeah, here it is.
[53:25.51]First aid.
[53:26.05]I don't have a med kit.
[53:26.92]Yeah.
[53:28.64]I'd like to know the next step.
[53:30.66]But maybe it just assumes that I'm on the next step.
[53:37.06]Because I don't have any of these things.
[53:41.25]I want to see the other... If I hit skip, it's going to skip the whole thing, isn't it?
[53:46.79]Do I have to be unpaused while reading it?
[53:48.37]Okay.
[53:54.18]I don't think so.
[54:02.17]Alright, just making sure that I wasn't going to skip at all.
[54:04.53]Alternatively, you can click the medic button from the right side command menu.
[54:07.75]This will heal all wounded squad members within range.
[54:11.47]So this one.
[54:13.75]So I'm going to get a band of merry men.
[54:15.77]Just you wait.
[54:19.73]The yellow areas of the health bar show bandaged health.
[54:22.97]Over time, this will slowly heal back to a healthy green.
[54:25.23]Okay.
[54:26.49]Okay.
[54:29.18]All body parts are each affected in their own way.
[54:31.12]Your head, chest, and stomach are your vitals.
[54:33.64]So these are vitals.
[54:34.50]Head, chest, and stomach are vitals.
[54:37.08]If any of them fall below zero, you will pass out.
[54:40.51]And if they reach minus a hundred, you will die.
[54:44.63]Well... Alright, that's good to know.
[54:50.22]If any of the limbs fall below zero, you won't be able to fight or walk properly.
[54:53.74]You can use a splint kit on broken limbs to speed up recovery and improve the limb's function if recovered.
[55:01.93]Okay, the blood stat shows how rapidly you are losing blood.
[55:04.95]Blood is slowly recovered over time, but if it drops below zero, you will pass out.
[55:09.93]After using a first aid kit to bandage your wounds, sleeping in a bed will help you fully recover.
[55:14.53]You can either build your own beds and camp beds, or stay at a bar in town for free.
[55:20.53]Alright, let's get in there.
[55:24.90]Where's the front door?
[55:27.66]There are people everywhere over here.
[55:32.12]Come on, I'm a dyin' man!
[55:33.34]Are these... storm wind guards?
[55:41.05]These have to be storm wind guards, right?
[55:42.73]I just need to walk up to a storm wind guard and ask where the fucking train is.
[55:46.37]Where's the tram?
[55:47.95]I keep forgetting where it is!
[56:00.36]Dust storm.
[56:02.88]Okay.
[56:04.52]Just get me in here.
[56:06.58]Why is that?
[56:06.90]Why are you carrying somebody?
[56:15.84]Ah.
[56:21.05]I need help.
[56:25.65]Citizen.
[56:25.97]Is this a citizen?
[56:27.39]How do I interact?
[56:30.95]Uh, bodyguard.
[56:33.79]Follow.
[56:34.45]Okay, samurai.
[56:36.97]Can I talk?
[56:42.39]Why is nobody helping me?
[56:46.20]This is an elaborate town.
[56:47.24]Alright, get in there.
[56:57.10]I'm just, like, shimmying around.
[56:59.20]I need food.
[57:00.10]I need shelter.
[57:00.90]I need anything.
[57:02.76]Somebody please save me.
[57:06.10]Well, what's wrong here?
[57:12.45]What was that?
[57:16.07]Attack a guard to get healed.
[57:17.51]Oh, don't give me that.
[57:22.09]These guys are freaking me out.
[57:23.07]Why are you all running like this?
[57:26.92]You're just gonna bump into me?
[57:29.30]A dying guy that's covered in blood, desperately looking for help?
[57:33.15]Nobody has done anything for me.
[57:37.95]Is this just supposed to be normal?
[57:41.93]Please help me!
[57:42.71]Okay, this is the commander.
[57:46.55]Gate sergeant.
[57:52.67]Is there like an emote?
[57:54.93]How do I... Can I just go in?
[57:56.43]Is this... Am I allowed in the city?
[58:07.14]Um... No, no, no.
[58:10.76]I don't want that.
[58:11.32]Jobs.
[58:12.60]Taunt.
[58:13.66]Sneak.
[58:15.90]Wave.
[58:16.56]How do I, like, say hello?
[58:17.92]Oh, okay.
[58:24.07]I can just go in.
[58:28.78]Alright, first aid.
[58:29.48]I don't have any money!
[58:33.40]Go to the bar, quick!
[58:44.69]Help me, please!
[58:45.89]I can't go on!
[58:50.41]What?
[58:50.92]Oh, wait... No, no!
[58:55.72]Get off me!
[58:57.28]Why am I unconscious?
[59:07.21]I don't get it.
[59:07.95]What happened to me?
[59:08.91]He's gonna heal me?
[59:10.05]At least I'm getting free heals.
[59:16.32]I passed out at the steps of the town.
[59:18.80]This guy, the only guy in town recognizes me as a slave and decides... Alright, yeah, I'm gonna go pick him up.
[59:24.30]He fell asleep on the walkway.
[59:26.76]That's great.
[59:30.00]It is free heals, though.
[59:32.08]Look, double heals.
[59:39.49]It's because this is a slaver town.
[59:44.23]Oh.
[59:47.53]Will they at least feed me in here?
[60:02.75]What the... Do they give slaves weapons?
[60:09.67]It's like, okay, here's what you do, and here's what you're going to do, and here's your knife.
[60:19.69]Is he taking me to the bar?
[60:23.79]Where am I going?
[60:30.15]Oh, man.
[60:31.09]When we just found our first few characters that we're going to join together.
[60:41.26]I kind of turned into a t-shirt somehow.
[60:51.75]How to escape a prison.
[60:52.89]You've committed a crime and been in prison.
[60:55.39]What crime?
[60:56.49]You need to wait out your sentence, have another squad member bail you out, or you can try to escape.
[61:01.47]To escape a prison cell, you need to use your lockpicking skills.
[61:04.64]Select your imprisoned character and hold right click on the cage to bring up the interaction menu.
[61:07.96]Select lockpick.
[61:09.44]The character must be conscious.
[61:15.80]Now you need to wait for success.
[61:17.30]The speed it takes to pick a lock is dependent on each individual's thievery skill.
[61:22.39]Once successful, hold right-click again on the cage and select Escape.
[61:25.21]You may want to wait until any nearby captors are distracted.
[61:31.24]Am I... I'm in a recovery combo.
[61:41.48]I mean, I'm technically kind of out of the cage.
[61:46.88]How long am I in a recovery coma?
[61:52.58]I gotta break out, and I'm gonna break out all these people.
[61:55.82]And I'm gonna put them in my squad, and we're gonna escape.
[61:57.78]Oop, I'm getting up.
[62:02.09]Okay.
[62:02.25]Am I awake?
[62:05.53]Use tools, use strength.
[62:06.81]I'm not strong enough to do that.
[62:14.35]Unlock shackles, and it...
[62:16.23]Pick lock is at 1%.
[62:21.33]I'm never getting out of this cage.
[62:37.02]Just do it 100 times.
[62:38.98]Yeah.
[62:43.30]I got it.
[62:44.02]Okay, get him off.
[62:48.95]Alright, let's get this open.
[62:51.25]I'm not skilled enough.
[62:53.85]I can't even do it.
[62:54.57]Escape.
[62:59.20]Nope.
[63:00.80]Now I'm stuck here.
[63:01.34]It's only been one day.
[63:10.36]Okay, I'm not obedient anymore.
[63:20.31]I have to reset.
[63:30.47]Game over.
[63:32.05]Use strength and lift up the cage.
[63:34.11]Well, I can't do that.
[63:34.97]Uh... So, what... What hap... How long do you sit in here for?
[63:46.99]Somebody will buy me?
[63:49.82]Do I get like a percentage of that money?
[63:55.91]Normal.
[63:57.47]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.
[63:58.63]Whoa, whoa!
[63:58.93]Alright.
[64:06.85]I'm not skilled enough.
[64:09.47]You're a slave, don't forget it.
[64:12.33]I mean, yes, I'm aware of that.
[64:18.24]Oh.
[64:19.12]It's because I took the shackles off.
[64:20.34]You put the shackles back on.
[64:25.01]Well, at least I got pants.
[64:29.29]So, why would somebody want to buy me?
[64:38.24]How many days do I have to sit in here?
[64:41.16]Take them off.
[64:50.66]Is he going to be mad about that?
[64:51.80]Am I like an unruly baby?
[65:00.61]This is my life now.
[65:06.19]I guess I've been standing there for a very long time.
[65:15.65]How do I get out of here?
[65:16.77]How do I like act?
[65:17.75]When does somebody come get me?
[65:21.37]Practice lockpicking.
[65:23.77]I'm just going to keep taking my shackles off and putting them back on.
[65:34.43]This is good practice.
[65:43.06]Thanks for the training, dummy.
[65:50.30]Alright, I got him off.
[65:54.55]Alright, now, pick luck.
[65:56.74]Still at 1%.
[65:57.22]Use strength.
[65:58.82]Escape.
[66:01.66]He's going to notice.
[66:02.30]He's going to come over and put him back on.
[66:07.78]Yeah, here we go.
[66:08.64]There we go.
[66:11.56]Put it back on.
[66:12.72]Give me more training.
[66:19.78]Thank you!
[66:23.57]No, no, no!
[66:24.05]My training went... My sensei went downstairs.
[66:28.69]I need him.
[66:29.19]Oh, it's night time.
[66:34.70]People are going to bed.
[66:37.92]How do I see my actual stats?
[66:42.36]Status window... Combat thievery.
[66:45.36]Lockpicking is at 9.
[66:46.28]Not bad.
[66:54.57]Why is everybody else just standing there?
[66:55.78]Because I think they've accepted their fate.
[66:58.76]Not me, though.
[66:59.90]I'm gonna practice every damn day.
[67:01.76]Get to a point where I can open this door.
[67:04.22]And then I'm gonna sprint punch that guy in his mouth as hard as I can.
[67:10.29]Got it.
[67:12.09]What level is my lockpicking now?
[67:15.15]Lockpicking 11.
[67:18.01]The ability to pick locks, open doors, and safes.
[67:19.73]More importantly, however, it's also used to break out of situations.
[67:22.35]Cages, jails, handcuffs.
[67:23.73]It's for those who have value, freedom, and don't want to wait around to be rescued.
[67:27.41]Okay.
[67:31.19]Thievery is also here.
[67:32.43]Alright, I'm just going to wait to get the shackles put on again.
[67:41.62]Just put them back on myself?! !
[67:49.68]Lock them?
[67:51.11]This is just doing the Rubik's Cube.
[67:52.81]I can't, like, lock them again.
[67:54.29]No, I can't.
[68:02.59]I have to wait for the guy to come.
[68:03.69]Practice on the door, I can't.
[68:06.43]I don't have enough skill to attempt the door.
[68:10.05]Save the shackles to sell them.
[68:16.08]Really?
[68:16.32]Really?
[68:20.37]How much are they worth?
[68:23.13]They're worth nothing.
[68:25.75]They have no sell value.
[68:26.83]Okay.
[68:29.23]You can sell the shackles for iron.
[68:35.31]Eat the shackles.
[68:37.73]Speaking of food.
[68:39.50]When do they feed you?
[68:42.70]Because it's been two days and I haven't gotten any food.
[68:47.36]And then unlock the other...
[68:52.33]Alright, here's what's going to happen.
[68:53.17]I'm going to unlock this door, and then I'm going to get put in this one.
[68:57.23]I'm going to unlock this one.
[68:58.25]I'm going to keep unlocking the doors until I have 100 in lockpicking.
[69:06.66]Alright, here we go.
[69:07.38]Here they come.
[69:07.82]They're going to notice again.
[69:08.66]Maybe they'll have food this time.
[69:19.79]He's been playing for an hour and hasn't done anything.
[69:23.87]No, I mean, hey, welcome to, uh, welcome to Kenshi!
[69:33.73]I hear noises.
[69:36.89]I did, I did pick one of the hardest things in the game, though.
[69:40.29]So, you know, I can, I should go back probably eventually here.
[69:44.47]And do one of the other scenarios.
[69:53.67]I'm gonna... I'm gonna die.
[69:54.97]I'm gonna starve to death in this cage.
[69:57.03]Uh-oh, he's learning.
[70:02.29]Shut it down.
[70:04.39]No, I'm interested.
[70:06.31]I'm not giving up on this character yet.
[70:11.35]I still have faith that I might be able to pull something off here.
[70:20.93]Do they feed us?
[70:22.28]How do we do anything?
[70:25.93]Is it a barrel?
[70:26.55]Can I do anything with it?
[70:31.07]Oh!
[70:32.59]Papa just got a new pair of pants!
[70:37.86]How did I get caught stealing?
[70:41.00]Oh, what is... You rats.
[70:53.25]What do you mean got caught?
[70:54.03]Where are they?
[70:55.57]Who took them?
[71:04.83]I didn't even get them.
[71:09.05]Alright.
[71:09.56]Stealing chance.
[71:10.16]46%.
[71:10.18]Get them.
[71:11.22]Got them.
[71:14.14]Oh, get fucked.
[71:18.92]Get fucked over, game.
[71:24.02]You've just stolen from someone.
[71:28.50]Be careful when selling stolen goods to traders.
[71:32.97]You might just find yourself in trouble with the law if they catch you.
[71:35.41]Oh, get fucking destroyed.
[71:41.33]You didn't think I had long arms?
[71:48.29]How to steal.
[71:49.17]Be careful.
[71:49.55]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[71:50.69]Well, that doesn't mean anything.
[71:51.79]I still have to get out of here.
[71:56.09]If everyone's selling stolen goods to traders, you might just find yourself in trouble with the law if they catch you offloading their allies' belongings.
[72:02.49]When you talk to a trader or initiate the trade screen, hover over a stolen item to check the chances of fencing success before selling.
[72:09.82]If the fencing chance is low and it was stolen from someone in the same faction, you'll likely be caught.
[72:15.88]Your best chance of selling stolen goods is to sell to a trader from another town and faction or find a thief in one of the town bars.
[72:22.76]Thieves will buy any item off you risk-free.
[72:24.52]However, their prices are much less profitable than the official merchant.
[72:29.60]Careful trying to open locked items and doors is illegal and could land you in trouble.
[72:34.42]Well, if you get caught, that is a rule.
[72:36.50]If the cursor shows red, then that action is hostile.
[72:39.70]Right.
[72:40.64]Like every other game.
[72:42.86]Entering sneak mode will help reduce the chance of you getting caught while committing crimes.
[72:46.72]You can find the sneak buttons at the bottom of the right of the UI.
[72:50.86]So, like, down here.
[72:53.69]Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.
[72:57.05]Oi!
[72:58.21]Wait, did I get out?
[72:59.73]Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[73:00.41]Something's happening here.
[73:09.38]Okay, cool.
[73:19.91]Hold on, I gotta put my new pants on.
[73:29.48]Where are we going?
[73:32.46]I thought I don't have shackles on anymore.
[73:34.37]No, I do.
[73:38.33]Make a break for it?
[73:41.61]But to where though?
[73:42.31]I don't have anything.
[73:42.95]I don't have any money.
[73:46.39]I just got a new pair of pants.
[73:47.52]I don't know.
[73:48.02]I lost the group.
[73:48.86]I lost the group on the field trip.
[73:50.64]I don't remember where I'm supposed to go.
[73:53.54]Where'd they go?
[73:54.30]I lost the group.
[73:58.24]Is this them?
[74:07.13]I lost the group on the fucking field trip.
[74:09.17]I swear to God.
[74:09.92]I don't know where anybody went.
[74:17.74]I'm going out the front door.
[74:19.38]I got a pair of pants I can sell for one cent.
[74:21.85]I'm going to go to the next town.
[74:34.04]Get me out of here!
[74:34.90]No!
[74:35.44]Don't touch me!
[74:36.04]What if I just hide over here?
[74:37.24]Where's the sneak button?
[74:38.87]Sneak!
[74:45.67]Is this sneak?
[74:46.27]I don't know what that means.
[75:00.10]What's wrong?
[75:00.54]What?
[75:00.94]What?
[75:08.98]No, get me out of here!
[75:11.67]Go down, go down!
[75:14.25]Quick, I need a bug!
[75:24.80]Oh, come on!
[75:25.78]I can't sprint with these on.
[75:38.87]I should have kept sneaking.
[75:40.15]Where are we going?
[75:49.70]He's taking me up the slide.
[75:50.58]This is cool.
[75:54.48]What's going on up here?
[75:57.26]Who's this guy?
[75:59.93]Wait, why are they all freaking out over here?
[76:01.29]What are you all doing?
[76:10.12]Ooh!
[76:15.32]I can do it now.
[76:17.62]I leveled up enough where I can do it.
[76:18.74]Did I get it?
[76:34.87]Okay, I got it.
[76:36.90]Set free?
[76:37.36]Not yet.
[76:38.16]Unlock shackles.
[76:40.01]I'm gonna wait till it's nighttime and I'm fucking outta here.
[76:42.96]I need to st- I gotta steal food from somebody's house or something, don't I?
[76:45.56]Alright, wait till night.
[76:48.68]I can open the door.
[76:49.38]I'm gonna free the other- the other slaves too.
[76:59.42]Alright.
[77:00.56]Time for night.
[77:06.53]Just wait till nighttime.
[77:07.45]We got a little bit... We gotta wait.
[77:09.93]And I'm gonna... I'm gonna build a shack in here.
[77:11.98]This is my new home.
[77:18.76]Okay, let's go.
[77:24.68]Uncheck obedient slave.
[77:25.90]Not yet.
[77:28.26]Nighttime.
[77:29.74]When everybody gets put up here.
[77:32.14]We're...
[77:42.37]Talk to.
[77:48.50]Hey, dude.
[77:49.06]No, that's his naked dude.
[77:50.08]How do I talk?
[77:52.80]Outlaw farmer.
[78:00.73]I'm too far away.
[78:03.61]I'm breaking this guy up.
[78:05.13]And we're making a run for it.
[78:09.71]I can hear a bunch of noises.
[78:10.57]Hold on.
[78:12.15]Steal his food.
[78:12.95]He doesn't have any food.
[78:13.73]He's in a cage.
[78:16.29]Move to the cage next to him.
[78:20.09]So, can I... Alright, hold on.
[78:23.41]Nobody up here, right?
[78:35.73]Okay.
[78:36.03]Okay, now I can talk.
[78:40.45]What are you looking at?
[78:43.33]You want to get out of here, don't you?
[78:44.49]So what are you in for?
[78:45.25]I'm busting out of here.
[78:45.97]Are you with me or not?
[78:47.89]You want to get out of here?
[78:48.57]He says, yeah.
[78:51.25]Let's bust these cages open and run.
[78:53.33]Then help me get out of here.
[78:54.41]Let's make a break for it.
[78:55.25]We'll have a better chance if we escape together.
[78:58.21]Alright, let's get these cages open.
[78:59.59]No, no, no, not right now.
[79:01.17]Wait till nighttime.
[79:08.37]My first friend.
[79:09.99]But he's going to die because we're both going to die.
[79:18.58]I mean, I can pick the lock that I just got in.
[79:24.94]Nothing in there.
[79:25.54]God damn it.
[79:28.03]Are they gonna remember that I was in this cage over here?
[79:31.49]I'm starving, I know.
[79:35.11]Oh, my first squad member.
[79:39.77]Hey, get me out.
[79:40.61]Okay, I think I just have to open it.
[79:43.25]Pick his lock, okay?
[79:48.40]Unlock my cage first.
[79:50.42]Yeah, I know, I know, I know, but I... What if they come up here?
[79:53.08]Are they gonna know that the... Use him as a distraction.
[80:05.80]Just eat him.
[80:06.40]I'm not gonna eat him.
[80:14.28]Okay, I'm not opening the door.
[80:15.38]I'm gonna wait till night.
[80:20.98]I don't want to open his door yet.
[80:22.30]Okay, here we go.
[80:22.78]Shh.
[80:24.58]Guard's back up here.
[80:29.94]The guard's going to see the shackles.
[80:31.58]Uh-oh.
[80:33.52]Willy, though?
[80:34.12]They're on.
[80:35.08]Is that enough to... Let me just get these out of here.
[80:38.73]By toggling Sneak, you are entering stealth mode.
[80:40.35]In this mode, you can perform stealth knockouts, kidnaps, and steal stuff.
[80:44.09]The stealth cursor displays two icons, an eyeball and a sun.
[80:47.51]When the eyeball is red, it means you are in view of nearby NPCs.
[80:51.01]When the eyeball is blue, it means that you are currently out of anyone's line of sight.
[80:54.60]The sun icon shows the light level.
[80:56.16]When the sun is shaded, you are at your least visible.
[80:59.42]Nightfall is prime for sneaking.
[81:02.28]Right-click on an NPC while sneaking.
[81:03.82]The percentage shows the chance of success.
[81:06.06]The higher your assassination skill, the higher the chance of doing a stealth knockout.
[81:08.90]To kidnap a KO'd NPC, hold right-click on them and select Kidnap.
[81:14.38]How to research... To research new tech, such as buildings, defensive weapons, blah blah blah blah blah, you need a research bench from the build menu.
[81:21.43]Okay?
[81:22.23]So, just a Minecraft bench.
[81:24.99]Either you can buy a house in a town, or you can build your own house outside of an NPC town.
[81:31.38]To craft items, you need to build a workbench from the crafting menu.
[81:34.98]First, though, you're going to need to research all the necessary buildings, equipment, and schematics needed for crafting.
[81:40.72]Build a research bench to learn new techs and crafts.
[81:42.76]Got it.
[81:43.00]I just want to get those off the screen.
[81:45.18]Alright, it's time for night.
[81:51.87]Not quite.
[81:52.37]Almost there.
[81:53.01]Enslave the slavers that enslaved you.
[81:56.50]I mean, they have full armor and weapons.
[81:59.82]We have to break out of here at night and sneak out the front door.
[82:03.80]No, the back door.
[82:04.52]Are there back doors?
[82:15.37]Don't slow it down.
[82:16.31]I'm scared that they're all going to run up here.
[82:25.56]You're still on board, right?
[82:27.76]Quick, look for a way... Okay, yeah.
[82:29.12]Yeah, I got the... It's in motion.
[82:31.39]The wheels are in motion.
[82:33.69]Activate sneak to train stealth.
[82:38.59]Are you sure?
[82:39.01]Is that really?
[82:39.47]Don't worry, the town will belong to you in a few hours.
[82:54.80]There's a ladder on the right.
[82:56.91]Ooh!
[82:57.37]Good eyes there!
[82:59.25]Good eyes!
[83:06.29]I'm starving.
[83:08.83]I'm gonna pass out, aren't I?
[83:10.21]If this goes down any further.
[83:11.39]Alright, somebody just got the shit beat out of them.
[83:21.36]They just fell down.
[83:24.98]There's fresh meat in the cage next to me.
[83:32.84]Let me scope this place out, though, because I do need food.
[83:36.00]I'm gonna have to take the bread from somebody.
[83:39.89]Hold on, let me... Where's there, like, an inn?
[83:47.25]Hold on, alt.
[83:47.91]Okay, here we go.
[83:49.83]So this is...
[83:54.62]Prisoner shackles.
[83:55.48]What?
[83:58.16]There we go.
[83:59.08]Right here.
[84:00.76]I'm going to sneak out.
[84:02.79]Those look like dumplings or something, right?
[84:05.07]Or like potatoes.
[84:06.47]I'm going in here and I'm going to take the thing on the front desk.
[84:09.87]And we can share it as friends.
[84:18.46]Ice cream.
[84:21.14]Here we go.
[84:28.66]It's time for nightfall.
[84:31.14]Should I open up every cage?
[84:33.40]That might be a good idea.
[84:34.42]Or just stick with the plan.
[84:38.06]Alright, open up every cage, or stick with the plan, Octor.
[84:42.90]Which one?
[84:56.21]It's not technically really night yet.
[84:59.79]I have to wait until everybody's asleep.
[85:04.57]Open, open.
[85:05.29]No, not yet.
[85:05.71]There are people walking around all over the place.
[85:10.16]Save the game.
[85:10.76]That's a really, really good idea.
[85:13.80]It auto-saves every 10 minutes, but... There.
[85:24.91]There.
[85:41.10]So close.
[85:44.72]Play the Pink Panther theme.
[85:46.30]No, that's too distracting.
[85:47.22]This game's on... See?
[85:48.80]Everyone that wanted me to go, there's a night guard right here that goes to sleep in like two hours.
[85:54.23]I would have walked right into him.
[86:00.19]Here we go.
[86:06.82]When he goes to bed, it's time to get up.
[86:11.88]Just go.
[86:12.58]I can't just go.
[86:16.86]Don't you understand?
[86:17.58]It has to be perfect.
[86:24.58]I don't have any items.
[86:26.68]I'm starving.
[86:28.32]Here we go.
[86:32.46]He's down there.
[86:33.08]I don't know, whatever he's doing at night.
[86:36.61]Rapidly.
[86:40.20]Whatever he's up to down there.
[86:45.37]Alright, is it time?
[86:47.49]No, he's not done.
[86:48.75]He's not done yet.
[86:52.43]There's two people doing it too.
[86:58.17]I don't know where the second person came from.
[87:04.84]Okay.
[87:06.80]But, he's downstairs!
[87:15.85]I think he's done.
[87:30.88]Use the ladder?
[87:35.06]He came back.
[87:35.76]I didn't know if he came back or not.
[87:37.35]I didn't, I thought, I didn't, I thought he, when did he go to sleep?
[87:41.61]It's 2 a.m.
[87:43.95]No, he's going back downstairs to, like, masturbate again.
[87:46.43]No, he's gone.
[87:49.46]Let's go.
[87:54.94]Get it?
[87:59.28]No, there it is.
[87:59.90]Alright, we got plenty of time.
[88:03.62]He's got 65 tabs open.
[88:07.67]Let's go.
[88:09.43]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[88:13.58]Where am I?
[88:15.42]Wait.
[88:18.82]Where's my character?
[88:20.54]Go!
[88:26.82]Go, Jeremy, go!
[88:27.50]Just go, go!
[88:28.04]I opened the door and he screamed.
[88:43.51]Is he alive?
[88:44.05]He didn't even wait for me.
[88:48.65]They're all down there having a great time.
[89:08.14]No!
[89:08.86]Then why is this guy- He didn't cut his leg off!
[89:12.42]Oh, what the fuck?!
[89:16.92]I can't get out of here!
[89:18.16]This- How am I supposed to get out of here?
[89:23.61]I need to help him!
[89:24.41]Oh, it has to go- Okay, he- I gotta eat this guy.
[89:31.95]I have to eat him.
[89:33.23]How do I eat him?
[89:41.12]Why can they hear... I don't understand.
[89:50.07]Why can they hear us?
[90:00.98]This... I was sneaking.
[90:03.86]Is it... Every time... I'm unconscious.
[90:13.21]Alright, so when the door opens, they just run up here.
[90:27.34]I'm safe, scumming.
[90:42.58]Okay, so let me understand this.
[90:45.73]So when I... I'm going to open his door.
[90:52.51]Really, dude?
[90:52.95]Come on.
[90:53.23]Give me a break.
[91:17.39]Turn off obedience.
[91:18.39]I'm on sneak.
[91:19.99]But when I open... Alright, will you get the fuck out of here?
[91:31.89]Turn off jobs.
[91:38.04]I'm on the sprint setting?
[91:41.08]Alright, there he goes.
[91:41.70]Here we go.
[91:42.28]One, two, three.
[91:43.61]Obedient Slave off.
[91:45.07]Sneak on.
[91:45.95]Jobs off.
[91:46.89]Open door.
[91:47.61]Escape.
[91:48.59]Sneak on.
[91:53.69]What the hell are you doing?
[91:55.53]Escape.
[91:56.89]What?
[91:57.91]What?
[91:58.09]Did I go back in?
[91:59.73]What?
[92:01.61]Obedient Slave off.
[92:02.77]Sneak on.
[92:03.71]Open his lock.
[92:06.71]Oh my god, he's back.
[92:21.45]Get out of here.
[92:28.63]Shackles.
[92:29.07]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[92:29.89]Just gotta wait till he gets out of here.
[92:36.38]Let the other guy out.
[92:37.42]Not with this guy sitting right here.
[92:39.50]He can't see you.
[92:40.32]You can escape if you sneak.
[92:41.82]He's not gonna do that.
[92:42.68]This random party member.
[92:46.40]I'm gonna open his door and see what happens.
[92:49.68]Because every time I open his door, he freaks out and just starts sprinting.
[93:00.85]Fuck him.
[93:01.35]Leave him.
[93:02.15]Look.
[93:02.37]See?
[93:02.67]Look!
[93:02.93]This is not my fault.
[93:03.91]This is his fault.
[93:06.83]Can I, like, tell him to not do this?
[93:09.01]Let's go to the squad tab.
[93:17.22]He's not here.
[93:41.02]Where's his hat?
[93:41.86]Where's his hat?
[93:42.56]I need my...
[94:00.37]What?!
[94:01.33]Wait, wait!
[94:05.62]Oh, they weren't even here!
[94:15.08]The ladder?
[94:15.72]I can't even use this ladder!
[94:32.07]How do I know?
[94:32.63]Because everybody in chat has been saying I can't use it.
[94:36.55]I've seen at least five people say that ladder's a prop.
[94:43.35]Watch.
[94:43.61]I'll tell you.
[94:44.03]Let's see if the ladder's a prop.
[94:45.11]Let's see if I'm getting baited here.
[94:46.95]Let's see if the ladder's a prop.
[94:47.91]Take off sprint.
[94:50.43]Let's check the ladder.
[95:04.52]Hey, look.
[95:05.02]The ladder's a prop.
[95:07.67]This is why I didn't try it.
[95:15.68]Oh, fuck.
[95:16.08]I'm out.
[95:17.36]Wait, hold on.
[95:17.70]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[95:31.38]How am I supposed to get out of here?
[95:33.42]I can't sneak out of here.
[95:34.84]I can't even see in the building.
[95:41.77]He's going to cause a distraction.
[95:43.95]I have an idea.
[95:46.55]I'm gonna open it, and I'm gonna sneak this way.
[95:50.19]Once I open it, I gotta move this way quick.
[95:52.36]I'm gonna pause it.
[95:55.04]Floor button.
[95:57.12]Floor button.
[96:01.06]Okay.
[96:01.44]Ooh, fuck.
[96:06.35]Okay, hold on.
[96:08.29]I can sneak by that.
[96:09.01]Wait.
[96:16.10]This guy causes a problem every time, though.
[96:17.63]Watch.
[96:21.21]Good.
[96:22.25]Alright, now, why is he sneaking up?
[96:26.81]Do you understand?
[96:27.89]He didn't do this before.
[96:37.97]Go.
[96:38.51]Get over there!
[96:39.29]What are you doing?! !
[96:50.64]I didn't stop sneaking.
[96:51.84]Look, it's right here.
[96:56.16]Fuck this guy.
[96:56.74]I'm leaving him.
[96:57.38]I'm taking him.
[97:01.52]I had to... I have to uncheck this box.
[97:04.58]What?
[97:06.88]This guy causes a problem every time.
[97:09.44]I'm taking his stuff.
[97:15.58]Here.
[97:16.02]Like, you know what?
[97:18.18]Deal with it.
[97:23.63]Here, you can have this.
[97:25.41]I'll just dress you.
[97:26.53]You can have the shackles too.
[97:44.77]I can't manage him.
[97:46.89]What?
[97:48.63]What happened?
[97:49.15]What happened?
[97:49.45]What happened?
[97:49.97]What happened?
[97:50.51]What happened?
[97:51.45]Did he just take the clothes?
[97:56.36]Why did he take my clothes?
[98:00.80]He realized... Give me his weapon.
[98:04.61]Where's his weapon?
[98:10.39]I can't grab his weapon.
[98:16.89]Steal the guard's weapon?
[98:21.39]Oh, it's this.
[98:21.89]Alright, I got a weapon.
[98:26.39]Legally blind.
[98:27.27]No, he's like a weird stick.
[98:29.58]Okay.
[98:30.64]So, uh, this guy ruins it every time.
[98:34.04]I open the door and he just walks out.
[98:35.74]He doesn't wait.
[98:36.38]He doesn't wait for me.
[98:37.22]He just goes.
[98:37.88]I can't control him.
[98:38.68]He just fucking walks away.
[99:05.56]He took you... I know he took the stick.
[99:23.88]Can I, like, hide in the barrel?
[99:27.10]Is this building on fire?
[99:28.10]What the fuck?
[99:30.37]Okay, look.
[99:31.31]So, we've got...
[99:34.10]Guy at the table, guy over here.
[99:37.42]What is in there, I wonder?
[99:39.34]Oh, shit.
[99:39.92]Okay, hold on a minute here.
[99:57.32]Will these guys see?
[99:58.56]I mean, what's their line of sight like?
[100:06.06]Ooh, I'm good.
[100:08.51]Just please tell me nobody comes over here.
[100:09.99]I'm gonna loot everything over here.
[100:13.45]Let's go right for the box.
[100:15.29]You gotta be kidding me.
[100:22.22]He saw me through the fucking bathroom stall crack.
[100:44.95]He heard me.
[100:52.88]Wait, let me try this one more time.
[101:00.34]Jump off the building.
[101:02.44]No, this isn't the game's fault.
[101:04.54]I'm playing on the hardest difficulty in the entire game.
[101:09.47]I'm playing at rock bottom.
[101:11.13]So we have to play rock bottom.
[101:12.45]We have to deal with the rock bottom issue.
[101:18.05]Why did I do that?
[101:18.75]Because chat peer pressured me into doing something once again.
[101:31.88]Oh no, that wasn't one guy.
[101:33.04]That was like 2000 guys.
[101:33.78]Alright, let's try this again.
[101:42.26]So is this, what is this with the, I don't understand what this is.
[101:47.51]What is the... Is that... Everyone moves together?
[101:50.55]Or is that sneak?
[101:51.23]Because this sneak is already activated.
[101:57.48]That's like fast run.
[101:58.86]So there is no other option besides this.
[102:02.14]Oh my fucking god.
[102:03.30]That's not what I wanted to do.
[102:07.10]Why did he go... Well, I would have walked into that guy anyways.
[102:23.53]It's for your whole squad to run together.
[102:25.05]That makes sense.
[102:30.08]Use the ladder this time.
[102:31.42]We already proved that the ladder is just a prop.
[102:33.72]It doesn't do anything.
[102:44.97]Can I like walk over this?
[102:46.31]I don't think I can.
[102:59.15]Six percent chance.
[103:07.66]Not gonna get out at six percent.
[103:11.88]Why is this one so much harder than the other one?
[103:18.01]You train your skills as a slave.
[103:19.39]Learn to fight, learn to revolt.
[103:20.63]Yeah, that's what I'm saying!
[103:24.79]Everybody wants me to eat this guy and then jump over the building!
[103:28.70]We gotta play rock bottom.
[103:35.80]Right click the ladder.
[103:40.64]No, there's no context menu there.
[103:58.47]You must believe in the ladder.
[104:03.59]Everything you do makes you stronger.
[104:04.77]Losing and dying makes you tougher.
[104:05.99]If you keep reloading save, you get rid of all that experience you've been learning.
[104:12.32]Yeah, this game is about getting your ass kicked.
[104:19.95]There's another person over here.
[104:27.73]I don't think you can go over here, but that would be pretty effective if you could.
[104:31.02]Alright.
[104:33.06]Shackles.
[104:33.76]I'm just gonna go naked.
[104:36.80]Stealth KO this guy.
[104:40.43]Isn't that gonna make noise?
[104:41.67]There we go.
[104:51.86]Watch this shit.
[105:09.76]Stealth KO that guy with 0%.
[105:13.10]That's not gonna work.
[105:18.10]What chance did you have?
[105:19.64]There's none.
[105:21.22]I can't hurt anybody.
[105:22.55]I can't fight anybody.
[105:23.47]I have to just deal with it.
[105:25.17]I've got to get out.
[105:25.79]I have to escape and I have to find something to eat.
[105:30.47]And then I'm gonna start over as like a man and his dog.
[105:36.17]Climb on the cage and WWE this guy.
[105:38.13]No, I'm going to take off the shackles, unlock the cage, and I'm getting out of here.
[105:45.26]Once this guy goes downstairs.
[105:55.11]I'm trying this one more time.
[105:57.17]I am on sneak.
[105:58.65]I am being very silent.
[105:59.51]No shackles.
[106:00.23]I don't have any gear on.
[106:08.81]no gear turk turk turk off slave no jobs no range only sneak this guy's just is that guy gonna see me I mean he's just sitting right there
[106:46.94]I can't sneak by that.
[106:52.79]Steal the gear from the back room?
[106:53.91]I've tried to twice.
[106:54.87]I mean, I could... I can't just run.
[107:01.49]They're faster than me.
[107:03.53]Is their AI going to go in different spots this time?
[107:06.57]It is.
[107:06.79]Okay, good.
[107:09.41]Go.
[107:09.47]Alright, I made it around the corner.
[107:22.25]I'm not moving a muscle.
[107:27.11]Alright, get me over here.
[107:27.85]Safe.
[107:36.52]Whoops.
[107:40.22]Alright, here we go.
[107:42.70]He's gonna do it.
[107:43.16]I'm gonna do it.
[107:49.99]What's in the box?
[107:51.23]There's nothing even in here.
[107:52.59]What a bait.
[107:53.31]There's nothing here.
[107:55.99]Why?
[107:56.57]What about in the safe?
[107:57.98]You don't have any money in your safe.
[107:59.48]Okay.
[108:00.06]What about this thing?
[108:01.32]Nothing.
[108:01.64]It's empty.
[108:04.30]Pick the lock.
[108:04.80]77% chance.
[108:07.86]This is what I get for practicing in the cell the whole time.
[108:12.88]Got it.
[108:14.45]Oh, cool.
[108:16.67]There's a flipbook in here.
[108:17.73]There's a notebook in here.
[108:19.83]Wanted.
[108:20.23]Cannibal leaders.
[108:22.53]Leader of the entire known cannibal population.
[108:24.53]Actual magical powers unknown.
[108:26.33]Reward 40,000 C. Sure, I'll take it.
[108:34.14]What am I doing?
[108:34.98]What?
[108:37.22]What happened?
[108:40.17]Was that an alarm?
[108:41.17]Was the book alarmed?
[108:42.17]Was the book alarmed?
[108:49.75]Did the book have a tripwire on it?
[108:56.16]Oh, he dropped a bunch of frames.
[108:57.28]Yeah, we're good.
[108:57.68]We're back.
[109:02.24]It was trapped?
[109:04.52]It was not trapped.
[109:05.30]I don't understand how it was a book... He's not running over here, right?
[109:14.75]Okay, so...
[109:17.45]There's nothing in any of these.
[109:18.99]There's something in here.
[109:23.06]They can hear you take stuff.
[109:25.00]All loot is alarmed in this game.
[109:26.32]Enemies for three miles will hear you.
[109:28.22]Oh.
[109:29.62]It's because I was reading that out loud.
[109:31.14]Maybe I shouldn't have read that out loud.
[109:32.48]What about in here?
[109:35.36]There's no stray weapon or food or clothes in any of this shit.
[109:41.94]More books.
[109:44.50]They're going to hear me take these books.
[109:50.11]Why am I Naruto running?
[109:52.26]Alright, I can't pick up anything.
[109:54.80]I just have to get out of here.
[110:11.77]I need to get that manga.
[110:16.22]Let's move this way.
[110:19.61]So, here's the question.
[110:20.59]There's so many guards everywhere.
[110:21.89]I don't have any shackles on.
[110:23.57]I just have a pair of pants.
[110:25.31]I have no food.
[110:28.41]People are saying so much blatantly false shit about this game.
[110:33.99]So what you're saying is, chat's trying to fuck me over on purpose.
[110:43.36]Blatantly false shit.
[110:46.52]How do I get out of here?
[110:49.76]I don't even know if I can get out of here.
[110:51.22]I think I just have to be a slave.
[110:52.86]You know what I'm saying?
[110:57.25]There's no way I can get out of this.
[111:06.97]Go out the back door?
[111:08.03]Yeah, but... I have to... I have to go... Nah, that's just more blatantly false shit.
[111:18.91]I have to go this way.
[111:20.15]I have to somehow sneak by all these guys.
[111:29.20]This person's gonna see me leave this door.
[111:33.84]I think I might just have to serve my time, yeah.
[111:36.72]I think so.
[111:37.18]Can I climb through windows?
[111:41.75]Uh, I don't think so.
[111:43.21]Look at all the guards everywhere.
[111:46.31]I can't even pick up a book.
[111:47.84]They'll know I'm picking the book up.
[111:50.04]Wait, what's this?
[111:50.76]Turn off this light.
[111:52.52]Auto haul.
[111:54.00]What?
[112:00.08]I have to- these guys have to get out of the way.
[112:04.18]Not that guy, the other one.
[112:07.58]Serve your sentence.
[112:11.95]I can't stealth knock anybody out.
[112:13.33]That guy has the weapon up there.
[112:15.17]I have to get that guy's weapon or get him out.
[112:25.19]Why do I have one arm?
[112:26.11]Because I picked the hardest difficulty in the game.
[112:30.83]Because I think maybe 15 people thought it would be funny.
[112:36.65]I can try to run.
[112:39.18]I can try, but I don't think that's gonna get me very far.
[112:44.83]Where's the quickest way out of here?
[112:47.17]I got so far to run.
[112:51.55]Look at how far I have to go.
[112:52.81]If I just click here and do sprint.
[113:03.30]Oh, fuck.
[113:03.80]Oh my god.
[113:14.69]I don't even know where I am.
[113:17.31]No.
[113:17.75]No, there's no getting out of here.
[113:21.27]No, I'm gonna... Okay.
[113:22.73]This is a fun thing.
[113:23.95]That was fun.
[113:24.49]We're gonna do a new game.
[113:28.27]This is what I've been on this whole time.
[113:29.87]I've been on rock bottom very hard.
[113:31.87]Zero dollars.
[113:32.95]You've hit absolute rock bottom.
[113:34.19]You're alone, unarmed, naked, hungry.
[113:35.71]You don't have any stuff.
[113:36.97]You've lost an arm.
[113:38.07]No.
[113:38.37]A man and his dog.
[113:43.69]And begin.
[114:03.67]Skeleton?
[114:10.42]Should I be a hive?
[114:11.60]Don't make him look weird.
[114:22.41]No.
[114:27.05]There's only two.
[114:32.12]We have to have a human.
[114:33.70]I can't do the weird hammerhead shark thing yet.
[114:38.22]So let's go... That's okay.
[114:52.87]It's you.
[114:54.99]Well, that's very funny.
[115:04.13]Arm bulk.
[115:15.47]Legendary posture.
[115:19.23]Legendary posture.
[115:30.18]This looks like I'm wearing one of those comedy sumo suits.
[115:46.16]Alright.
[115:47.23]That's fine.
[115:50.21]We don't need to spend that much time.
[116:02.04]I'm just making a turtle.
[116:04.38]That's what it's going to end up being.
[116:12.91]Let's go like right here.
[116:21.68]Oh man.
[116:31.70]I like the raised eyebrows.
[116:44.42]I'm not spending that much time on this one.
[116:53.05]I just want to get into the game again.
[117:10.61]Oh boy.
[117:13.77]Oh boy.
[117:18.22]It's perfect.
[117:19.26]It's perfect.
[117:38.55]It's Sephiroth.
[117:40.67]If they got crushed by a fucking anvil.
[117:44.88]Alright, I'm happy with it.
[117:48.24]Name.
[117:48.54]I need a name.
[117:49.54]Where's the name?
[117:50.16]I have an Anvil Roth.
[118:15.69]Anvil Roth?
[118:16.58]No.
[118:21.64]Canned.
[118:26.14]Canned Roth.
[118:27.12]There you go.
[118:38.67]Ugh.
[118:41.67]I fucking hate it.
[118:42.65]Alright, what about my dog?
[118:44.37]Do I get to make my dog?
[118:50.49]There are other characters whose appearance haven't been changed.
[118:52.90]Wait, wait, wait.
[118:53.74]No, no, no.
[118:56.20]I do get to make the dog.
[118:58.86]Or do I?
[119:02.80]I don't think I can do anything with the dog.
[119:09.55]What's Sephiroth's...
[119:15.00]What was Sephiroth's weapon called?
[119:16.36]Didn't he have, like, a scythe or something?
[119:33.31]The Massamune?

[125:06.58]I'm just gonna go start picking up stuff on people's bodies.
[125:09.60]I have nothing to do with this conflict.
[125:10.80]It's just free stuff for me.
[125:12.84]Oh, well, oh yeah, I'll take a fucking sword.

[126:29.72]Stealing chance, 100%.
[126:30.70]Was it a standard grade?
[126:31.74]No, that's good.
[126:32.46]I'm going to keep that on.
[126:33.14]Do you have any money?
[126:39.44]This guy has some other stuff too, though.
[126:42.96]What is that?
[126:43.40]Holy shit, what's that thing?
[126:44.28]Just take it.
[126:44.62]I don't know.
[126:52.99]Evil thief.
[126:53.55]Alright, hold.
[126:57.21]This guy's kind of hard.
[127:00.29]Get him.
[127:03.71]Hit him with your sword.

[127:06.85]Uh, can you not hit him?
[127:16.63]Get him.
[127:17.75]Bite him.
[127:21.83]That guy has a huge cloud weapon, too.
[127:23.61]This is gonna be, like, true Final Fantasy.
[127:25.21]This doesn't look like a commander or anything, is he?
[127:27.01]How you doing?
[127:28.13]Oh, shit, I gotta hit...
[127:31.02]Give the sword to the dog.
[127:32.20]That's not how this works.
[127:39.02]Swing your sword at him!
[127:44.96]No, wait!
[127:48.23]Why is this guy so much better than me?
[127:52.59]Can I see his health?
[127:54.39]He's almost dead.
[128:02.71]Oh my... He's a soldier and you are a random idiot.
[128:21.74]Well, how did I take out the other soldier?
[128:25.74]Don't worry, I'll...
[128:35.10]I might have been too heavy.
[128:35.96]Alright, well, let's just... Let's get easy stuff.
[128:39.47]I'm taking one person and we're getting out of here.
[128:41.33]Alright, come on.
[128:50.01]Is this too big?
[128:50.87]No.
[128:59.60]Alright.
[129:01.22]Let's go.
[129:01.60]Let's get out of here.
[129:02.12]Out.
[129:02.20]Out.
[129:04.41]Out, out, out, out, out, out.
[129:05.71]Get out.
[129:09.75]Okay, wait.
[129:10.37]There's another sword over here.
[129:11.59]Get it.
[129:12.43]And then get out.
[129:14.19]That's a cool sword.
[129:15.05]Take it.
[129:15.31]I don't know what this is, but take it too.
[129:16.53]I don't want those pins.
[129:17.81]Just go.
[129:21.46]Am I too heavy?
[129:27.12]Alright, we're far enough away from the battle.
[129:28.34]Let me see what else this guy has.
[129:31.26]Can I actually take a look?
[129:34.98]Attack bonus plus six.
[129:36.86]Plus six.
[129:37.42]Damage versus animals.
[129:38.40]It's the same weapon.
[129:40.40]Armor penetration.
[129:41.22]I need to go safe and look at this stuff.
[129:52.49]Alright, dog is fine.
[129:55.67]Dog just has backpack.
[129:58.43]Does not have anything else.
[130:01.17]Alright, I'm good.
[130:09.47]Let us continue.
[130:10.57]Let's go this way.
[130:11.25]Oh no, that's the dog.
[130:14.48]Sorry.
[130:16.06]You are on bodyguard and staying close.
[130:18.20]Good.
[130:18.46]We're both hungry.
[130:19.44]At least he is.
[130:23.24]You can have conscious characters carry KO'd characters to safety.
[130:26.95]That's good to know.
[130:29.07]Carry them to a bed.
[130:30.83]The rescue job will find nearby unconscious allies and automatically carry them to a bed if there are any in the vicinity.
[130:35.98]Interesting.
[130:36.62]And disguises.
[130:37.86]If you have the complete outfit, you can use faction uniforms to disguise yourself.
[130:42.24]Disguise success is dependent on the stealth skill stat.
[130:46.38]Your character status will show as disguised when you are hidden in full uniform.
[130:53.65]Okay.
[130:54.49]Careful you don't get caught wearing a faction's uniform.
[130:56.27]Most people don't take too kindly to impostors.
[131:01.38]You got it.
[131:03.87]So, it's time to just explore.
[131:05.39]I'm thinking we go up to the north here.
[131:07.63]Into the cold.
[131:11.33]That sounds like a good time to me.
[131:13.55]I need to make a house.
[131:17.95]I got a lot of stuff to do.
[131:25.94]How many money?
[131:26.48]I got 13 cents.
[131:30.91]It says, disguise blown.
[131:33.25]Somebody who's seen through your disguise, cool down 60 seconds.
[131:35.49]We're going to be far enough away from those people that it's not going to matter.
[131:44.02]Whoa, what happened over here?
[131:50.02]Something crawled as a person.
[132:00.83]Are you alive?
[132:01.73]Ooh.
[132:08.71]Saber, cutting damage, 3-9.
[132:09.63]5-2.
[132:09.77]Blunt, 0.02.
[132:12.71]Blunt, this is better.
[132:15.03]Blood loss, this is just better.
[132:16.33]Attack bonus, minus 5.
[132:18.59]Plus 6.
[132:19.28]Indoors penalty.
[132:20.16]There's an indoors penalty on this one.
[132:21.68]Wait.
[132:21.94]This is much lighter.
[132:26.26]Aw, fuck this thing.
[132:27.00]What about this?
[132:29.68]Metal plate, blunt resistance 7, 17.
[132:31.56]It's actually better.
[132:37.28]Shirt?
[132:42.20]What's this?
[132:45.58]Cut resistance efficiency.
[132:48.12]This is armor.
[132:49.52]Yeah.
[132:51.86]It is lighter, though.
[132:53.58]By a lot.
[132:54.46]No, it's not.
[132:55.14]Yeah, it is.
[132:58.60]What happened to my boots?
[133:01.58]Did I just throw the boots on the ground?
[133:06.82]Where'd my boots go?
[133:10.79]What happened to my shoes?
[133:11.83]Where did the shoes go?
[133:16.21]I didn't have... Oh, right, because... Okay.
[133:18.31]I forgot that I didn't save it until then.
[133:19.89]Let's check this other guy.
[133:27.44]Blood loss... 6-5-13...
[133:31.15]It's actually better.
[133:31.75]Attack bonus minus 4, though.
[133:36.05]I'm not sure that's better from what I have right now.
[133:39.35]More defense.
[133:45.86]Carrying too much stuff.
[133:47.38]Well, I'm not going to use this, so you can have it in your... Total weight, 38 out of 15.
[133:54.92]Oh, shit.
[133:55.62]Okay, no, I am too heavy.
[133:58.34]Let's see what happens if I take that off.
[133:59.64]18 out of 15.
[134:01.16]13 out of 15.
[134:06.55]That's alright.
[134:07.13]I got... That's alright.
[134:09.67]Use the Cloud Sword.
[134:13.01]Armor Penetration.
[134:13.75]Damage versus Robots.
[134:14.87]19 out of 15.
[134:21.62]Wait.
[134:32.17]Where the fuck would I just... God damn it.
[134:37.01]I mean, I can't pick that up.
[134:43.49]Why can't I pick that up?
[134:49.43]That's fine.
[134:51.18]Uh, I can sell this stuff, though.
[134:52.38]How much does it sell for?
[134:54.34]Seventeen hundred!
[134:55.42]I don't even care how much I weigh.
[134:58.78]I will slug my way to a town.
[135:03.29]Weapon 2... no, it doesn't fit in that slot.
[135:06.60]Alright, well, I'm gonna be- I'm very heavy, but... Wearing- having this- just wearing it, is it train strength?
[135:14.94]So I just have to weigh down on myself?
[135:17.12]Does it matter if it's in my inventory, or can I just- do I have to put it on?
[135:24.22]Click on the name of the item.
[135:27.92]Oh, there we go.
[135:28.82]So you hold Alt.
[135:32.99]Can't pick that up.
[135:34.51]Well, I'll just keep that here for fun.
[135:38.67]So, I can't really move that well, but let's go up here.
[135:42.47]So I'm gonna bang him right... Actually, I can just go like this, right?
[135:45.06]Yeah.
[135:46.18]So I'm gonna move very slowly, but I don't want to walk across the battlefield.
[135:51.08]I'm not going to, right?
[135:51.84]I mean, I kinda am.
[135:57.41]Yeah.
[135:58.09]I'm untouchable right now, don't worry.
[136:11.53]They're all fighting over there.
[136:12.85]I just need to slowly... Where's my strength?
[136:15.07]Let's see, stats.
[136:17.41]Strength.
[136:21.65]28.
[136:21.67]28%.
[136:21.95]29%.
[136:22.33]That's so... You actually have to strength train.
[136:28.85]I'm probably going to get hungry doing this, aren't I?
[136:30.35]There, okay.
[136:38.32]What's that on the ground?
[136:39.04]Popcorn?
[136:43.22]Gotta hit the gym.
[136:43.94]I do have to keep an eye out for a town.
[136:49.03]Ooh.
[136:49.77]No, that's a camp.
[136:51.85]But what is that, though?
[136:57.73]I mean, should I investigate this?
[137:00.86]Probably not.
[137:01.44]There's nothing here.
[137:10.11]No bandits, no slavers anywhere, that's good.
[137:19.12]I'm okay for now.
[137:20.74]I'm just gonna slowly make my way.
[137:26.90]Strength.
[137:30.84]This is the lamest thing.
[137:33.44]Click the building.
[137:42.51]public hamlet condition small shack doesn't say anything speed up the game speed yeah I'm just like kind of walking slowly okay how close are we now not close at all can you build a car in this game
[138:17.51]That's interesting looking.
[138:18.63]Let's keep going.
[138:21.61]Discovered... Wait, what did I discover?
[138:31.22]Ravaged Hamlet.
[138:32.18]Is this the zone?
[138:35.62]How's my strength doing?
[138:51.26]What is that?
[138:52.78]Ravaged Hamlet, Guard Outpost, Bast.
[138:56.82]There are four people that live here?
[138:58.68]Fourteen live in the city.
[139:01.95]This is just nothing out here over here.
[139:04.25]Then what is that?
[139:13.49]No, no, no.
[139:13.87]Hold on.
[139:14.21]I... I have to discover.
[139:19.68]Well, let's just keep going.
[139:22.06]Uh-oh, it's dark.
[139:22.88]I need to set up a camp or something.
[139:23.96]Like, a campfire?
[139:29.29]I hear something, I hear something, I hear something.
[139:30.63]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[139:31.63]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[139:32.91]I heard, like, clanging.
[139:37.41]Was it me?
[139:40.60]It might have just been me.
[139:48.36]What's that?
[139:50.27]Is that a new squad member, potentially?
[139:55.71]What is it?
[139:56.03]It's a bone dog.
[140:00.03]Oh, no.
[140:03.29]I'm gonna say... This game is huge.
[140:07.97]Food!
[140:08.27]It's food!
[140:08.69]It's food!
[140:09.09]Okay, I can eat that dog?
[140:12.95]I'm okay, though.
[140:13.59]We're not hungry.
[140:19.95]I can make it.
[140:23.27]I played for three days before I saw camp.
[140:25.51]Holy shit.
[140:30.11]Discovered watchtower.
[140:31.49]Let's take a look at what it is.
[140:33.95]Watchtower.
[140:34.61]What do you think?
[140:38.04]Should we check it out?
[140:43.94]Let's go to the watchtower.
[140:51.51]Alright.
[141:02.31]This dust, this feels so stupid.
[141:13.58]Okay, slow it down.
[141:14.52]I wanna see where we are.
[141:19.12]There's the watchtower.
[141:24.78]The question is, what is in the watchtower?
[141:26.94]I see a band of... I'm not sure what.
[141:30.76]Are these raiders or... Hungry bandits.
[141:37.70]I don't want to cross their path for sure.
[141:45.66]Whoa!
[141:47.72]Go this way!
[141:48.20]Go this way!
[141:48.58]Go this way!
[141:48.96]Go that way!
[141:49.36]Go that way!
[141:49.72]There's so many people right here.
[141:52.66]These are paladins.
[141:53.53]Oh, wait, no, no.
[141:53.97]This is fine.
[142:02.36]Paladins are not going to attack on sight, right?
[142:12.03]Why would they?
[142:12.47]Yeah, I'm just going to avoid them.
[142:24.42]I want to go into the tower over there.
[142:27.66]That's not where they're going, right?
[142:31.78]Holy Chosen.
[142:32.66]Holy Sentinel.
[142:34.76]Quiet.
[142:35.08]Let's go.
[142:48.77]I'll get up there.
[143:01.41]He's five times wider than he is tall.
[143:05.29]They're going a really weird route.
[143:06.73]Alright, I think I'm okay to run.
[143:12.17]What's my strength at now?
[143:16.53]Three.
[143:16.91]I'm doing a great job.
[143:25.00]Just walking around with incredibly heavy armor.
[143:27.26]Alright, we're good.
[143:29.34]Both sides.
[143:34.05]Let's get up there.
[143:45.60]What's in here?
[143:51.90]Arm of Ocarin.
[143:56.36]It's finally going to be light out.
[144:09.40]Why is everyone freaking out?
[144:10.28]Don't, don't, don't... What?
[144:13.29]Don't go in there, don't go in there, don't go in there, don't, why?
[144:15.35]I can, I can have a conversation with these guys.
[144:27.07]Save it, I'll save it, fine.
[144:36.10]Okay.
[144:37.42]Conversation.
[144:39.54]Let's talk about what we can do for each other.
[144:41.52]I've got some supplies if you guys have anything I can trade.
[144:51.67]There is no... That guy had a chat bubble.
[144:59.38]Out of bounds.
[145:00.04]Get out.
[145:10.02]I can sleep in their beds?
[145:11.02]Alright, that's fine.
[145:21.24]Leave.
[145:21.88]Oh.
[145:25.00]Alright, alright, alright.
[145:25.90]Relax, I'm leaving.
[145:28.08]There's the guy with the speech bubble.
[145:29.27]Why aren't you leaving your trespassing?
[145:30.47]Get up.
[145:30.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[145:32.77]Talk to Paladin.
[145:34.97]Blessings from the Lord of Light, brother.
[145:37.39]Ocarin's light shines brightly today.
[145:39.19]A good omen.
[145:40.97]Any travel advice?
[145:41.81]Any tips on how to live more wholesomely for an Orcronite newbie?
[145:47.38]Greetings, are you free to discuss the word of Narco?
[145:50.25]Sorry, I have to go.
[145:52.81]Any tips on how to live more wholesomely for a newbie?
[145:57.15]Study the scriptures of light, meditate on them, pray to Okren, and respect his holy servants with an open heart.
[146:04.20]Brother, this is the way to a pious existence.
[146:08.32]For darkness preys on an undisciplined mind.
[146:11.16]As for duty, if you are blessed with the skills for it, you may carry out Okren's retribution directly by bringing marked heretics to the Inquisitorium.
[146:19.95]Any travel advice?
[146:22.93]Venturing on a pilgrimage, brother?
[146:25.43]Well, it's best to stick to holy territory.
[146:27.13]The Outer Lands are infested with Narcos heretics that will try to deceive and tempt you into the darkness with them.
[146:33.63]Hmm.
[146:34.91]But if you must venture further, above all else you must avoid traveling northwest.
[146:40.52]Only the most devilish monstrosities prowl there, a hundred times the size of a man with the hunger of a rabid demon.
[146:46.84]Isn't that where I was planning on going?
[146:50.02]The foolish treasure hunters are the only travelers to delve there and never to return.
[146:54.50]But how tragic it is.
[146:56.26]There's nothing worth searching for.
[146:57.90]There's no place for riches if Ulcren is already in your heart.
[147:02.46]Thanks for the info.
[147:06.17]Alright.
[147:08.53]Hey, thanks.
[147:11.03]That was actually some pretty good info.
[147:12.15]You have any food?
[147:19.15]What did I do?
[147:19.79]I saved the game.
[147:22.19]They didn't like that I saved the game.
[147:26.24]What?
[147:28.48]What are you doing?
[147:29.94]Hey!
[147:32.56]I don't understand.
[147:36.62]Where are we going?
[147:37.90]Why is this happening?
[147:44.99]They told you to leave.
[147:45.93]I just had a conversation with one of them.
[147:53.89]I was literally just talking to the guy for like 10 straight minutes about Okran.
[147:58.45]And thanks for the tips and advice.
[148:00.01]Time for me to leave.
[148:00.81]Goodbye.
[148:01.82]See you later.
[148:02.38]Where's the dog?
[148:36.16]Okay.
[148:40.21]Uh... Dog only.
[148:53.18]I don't understand.
[148:54.02]I... I don't get it.
[148:57.30]I was just having a conversation with the dude.
[149:01.02]First aid.
[149:01.88]Yes, use it.
[149:16.33]Just run, run and don't look back!
[149:30.37]Get out of the cage, quick!
[149:35.58]Get, pick the lock, get out of the cage, now!
[149:45.37]Alright, I can- dying, I gotta go quick.
[149:47.61]Quick quick quick, get out get out out out out.
[149:51.39]Okay, set free.
[149:55.05]Escape.
[149:57.57]What am I- what do you mean?
[149:58.31]What's wrong with you?
[150:02.72]Why am I crawling?
[150:04.34]Get up!
[150:06.68]What's wrong with my leg?
[150:07.62]Come on, what?
[150:16.64]You're there.
[150:17.10]You're not welcome here.
[150:17.90]Don't make me ask you twice.
[150:31.58]I can't even stand up.
[150:33.10]I was gonna fucking leave.
[150:34.54]I was talking to the guy out in front of the front door.
[150:44.01]I was standing right here, having a conversation on the steps of their house.
[150:49.35]Alright, let's go.
[151:13.88]See, out of bounds.
[151:14.76]I'm gone.
[151:16.78]I'm gone.
[151:17.30]Bye.
[151:18.14]See you later.
[151:21.29]Thanks for nothing.
[151:25.83]Having a conversation doesn't sound like leaving.
[151:28.47]Well, so if they want me to leave so bad, why would that guy have a full conversation about the Lord of Light with me?
[151:42.28]Get out of here, you piece of shit.
[151:44.12]You're a scumbag.
[151:45.94]Hey, so the Lord of Light, let me give you some tips first, by the way.
[151:49.42]So go, if you go, don't go to the Northwest.
[151:51.16]There's some scary guys up there.
[151:52.77]Be careful.
[151:53.55]Oh, if you want another tip, make sure you have enough supplies and kill him.
[151:58.77]Murder him and his dog.
[152:12.01]You sounded like a YouTuber there.
[152:14.29]Alright, where am I going?
[152:15.33]Where am I allowed to be?
[152:16.45]Okay, here's the actual town.
[152:21.76]We're going to the actual city.
[152:26.58]It's right there.
[152:29.68]I have too much armor.
[152:30.48]Yeah, but I'm building up strength.
[152:36.67]The YouTuber voice.
[152:49.39]Alright.
[152:50.23]There's shit going on over there.
[152:51.75]Maybe I... They told me not to go up here.
[152:55.27]But that kind of makes me want to go up here.
[152:57.63]Because... Maybe they're just liars.
[153:00.93]Where's the dog?
[153:02.09]Come on.
[153:02.49]Oh, we gotta match speeds here, man.
[153:07.73]I'm, like, losing the dog.
[153:12.51]Come on.
[153:14.32]Get over here.
[153:21.31]Quickly.
[153:30.47]We have to stick together.
[153:40.24]There we go.
[153:40.94]You can have 20 people in your squad?
[153:44.68]That's actually insane.
[153:45.54]Maybe I should just make a camp or something.
[153:47.14]What do you need for materials?
[153:51.55]To run your own camp.
[153:58.17]The dog is the only smart one here.
[153:59.85]Okay.
[154:02.74]I'm going to build a house over here.
[154:13.76]There's so much to explore.
[154:15.00]I don't even know where to go.
[154:16.12]I don't know what to do.
[154:16.94]I'm so overwhelmed.
[154:18.52]I'm just going to go this way.
[154:19.66]I guess until I find another town.
[154:26.71]Wait, hold on.
[154:29.47]No, these are holy servants.
[154:30.35]We're fine.
[154:35.42]How's my strength?
[154:37.16]-2?
[154:37.92]For what?
[154:38.50]Because I'm hungry.
[154:39.04]I don't have any food on me.
[154:46.60]Just build a house.
[154:47.76]I can't.
[154:48.70]I need materials.
[154:49.74]Are these holy?
[154:51.33]Holy servant, yeah.
[154:55.52]Southwest is a good starter area?
[154:57.72]Well, that's gonna take me a long time to get there.
[154:59.96]Okay, hold on.
[155:06.70]Should I just bang a U-turn and go down here?
[155:08.90]I'm gonna go down here.
[155:16.38]Hey, hey, hey, you're going too fast, going too fast.
[155:17.90]Stay with me.
[155:24.50]These guys hostile than not, right?
[155:42.45]Alright, any huts?
[155:44.27]Any- okay, there is a congregation over here.
[155:48.09]Discovered farm ruins.
[155:49.86]There better be steaks and sodas and shit, like canned meat and stuff.
[155:59.38]And this is taking me up.
[156:06.94]See if we can find anything in the ruins.
[156:14.59]Alright, I don't see anything over here.
[156:17.54]This looks fairly safe.
[156:21.90]Is it a campfire?
[156:23.10]There's a fresh campfire here.
[156:24.14]Uh oh.
[156:27.62]Uh.
[156:36.55]But that means there probably are supplies somewhere.
[156:42.93]Hold Alt?
[156:43.47]I am.
[156:44.90]I'm holding alt right now.
[156:52.01]Nothing at this fresh campsite?
[157:02.07]How can there be nothing at a fresh campsite?
[157:11.93]What am I looting?
[157:14.38]No, they don't have any meat in here.
[157:15.74]Okay, that's a nice nap.
[157:38.20]No, nothing else in these ruins.
[157:43.61]Wait, is that like a... What's that?
[157:46.38]No, nothing.
[157:48.06]Well, that sucks.
[157:50.42]How can there be nothing in here?
[157:54.11]Hold up, traveler.
[157:55.83]Speak with me.
[157:56.47]Speak... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

[158:59.66]Free stuff.
[159:02.24]Ingredients.
[159:02.84]Food cube, dried meat.
[159:05.90]So, I need to eat this right now.
[159:08.86]How do we, let's split it.
[159:14.54]Pick up.
[159:16.56]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[159:17.44]Put the dog down.
[159:18.18]No.
[159:21.02]Put the dog down.
[159:23.07]Why is he carrying it like this?
[159:25.31]How do I put the dog down?
[159:26.79]Okay.
[159:28.49]Okay.
[159:30.95]Jesus.
[159:33.01]They eat autom- you eat automatically.
[159:36.85]You do?
[159:40.89]You just eat it automatically.
[159:43.77]Oh, okay.
[159:44.25]Alright.
[159:50.46]Oh, you do?
[159:51.02]Alright.
[159:51.44]Okay!
[159:53.46]Nice.
[159:55.57]First victory of the night, and it only took 2 hours and 41 minutes to find food.
[160:00.30]And I didn't even find it, somebody gave it to me.
[160:02.88]Somebody entered my Dark Souls game and dropped like 20 humanities on the ground.
[160:07.40]And then waved and fucking disconnected.
[160:10.66]Hey, thanks.
[160:15.67]I appreciate it.
[160:22.06]Alright, right.
[160:22.68]Let's see if there's anything here.
[160:23.76]Let's zoom in on the map a little.
[160:24.94]I want to see if there's any more towns, man.
[160:31.34]Farm ruins.
[160:32.19]There's nothing there.
[160:32.85]Um... I was told not to go this way because it's dangerous, so I'm going to go... this way.
[160:44.55]We'll go around and down.
[160:45.87]Once we hit the lake, we're going to go down here.
[160:48.03]So let's just make our way this way.
[160:55.44]I'm still in Paladin territory, I believe, so... Feed your dog?
[161:02.79]The dog eats at the same time as you, right?
[161:06.99]Are we not sharing this food?
[161:07.99]Oh no, we're not sharing the food!
[161:12.75]Wait, why?
[161:13.23]I gotta put the food in the dog's inventory.
[161:25.38]How do I keep them both open at the same time?
[161:35.05]The dog can't eat from your inventory.
[161:36.39]You have to drop it on the floor and put it in your backpack, which you don't have.
[161:56.58]Okay.
[161:58.66]What happened?
[162:07.91]Who ate the ration pack?
[162:14.49]He ate it.
[162:15.47]Well, why is he still at 130?
[162:29.16]He ate the whole pack!
[162:33.96]He ate the- You ate all of our rations!
[162:36.08]That's all we had!
[162:37.50]We- I don't- Wha- What?!
[162:42.23]Of course, you can't like leave food on the ground, guys.
[162:47.63]Yeah, just take like 20 sandwiches and put them down on the floor and your dog will just eat one of them.
[162:53.75]God.
[162:56.30]Alright, I wanted this the way I wanted to go.
[162:57.88]No, I wanted to wrap around here.
[162:59.18]Alright, we're fine.
[163:13.63]I wanted to go around this way.
[163:17.01]So I kind of went the wrong way.
[163:21.01]Dog equals food.
[163:22.84]No, that's not going to happen.
[163:23.98]I'm not going to eat the dog.
[163:27.48]You probably can't even eat the dog.
[163:35.16]Something over there.
[163:37.10]What's that?
[163:39.22]Distraction.
[163:39.84]Let's see.
[163:44.70]Dog?
[163:47.03]What are you doing?
[163:52.57]What's wrong?
[163:53.07]Oh, okay.
[163:53.63]You got stuck.
[163:56.74]Alright, let's take a look.
[163:59.08]Holding Alt, looking around, seeing if I can find any items.
[164:02.54]In this broken-down house.
[164:06.90]Ooh, permajobs.
[164:10.26]You can organize your squad by assigning them jobs in the orders menu.
[164:14.49]It's especially useful for farms, mines, and other production jobs, since assigned characters will automatically store and replenish raw materials as they work.
[164:21.79]Okay.
[164:23.39]Okay.
[164:25.99]To assign a job, select a character, then hold shift while clicking to interact with the object or building you wish to assign them to.
[164:33.07]Okay, hold shift while right-clicking on an object.
[164:44.09]And then you can assign a job.
[164:47.85]You can give characters multiple jobs.
[164:49.30]Topmost jobs in the orders menu will always take priority.
[164:54.78]Okay.
[164:56.41]can remove job at any time by pressing it on the x so why did it tell me really can you do this what am I getting from this am I gonna get materials
[165:27.38]Uh, do I have a progress bar?
[165:29.00]I'm acting... I'm being a real dwarf.
[165:39.09]Is this completely... futile?
[165:42.95]I'll just... I'll just left-click on the thing.
[165:46.93]Output.
[165:48.27]Copper.
[165:51.03]Copper quality.
[165:52.53]20.
[165:55.65]Workers, 0 out of 2.
[166:00.56]This is the progress bar I'm not mining them I'm mining something else Okay, uh, that's the one
[166:31.16]I'm going to build a house right here.
[166:32.91]I'm going to build a fire.
[166:36.25]I'm going to build a house.
[166:41.31]You are so stupid.
[166:42.49]My two-year-old sister has a higher IQ.
[166:45.03]What?
[166:45.27]Because I didn't know which... What do you mean copper?
[166:50.11]How was I supposed to know?
[166:52.29]They're all the same thing.
[166:55.65]Look it.
[166:56.17]I don't even know which one I'm standing in front of.
[167:01.00]is apparently this one here.
[167:02.79]I'm here.
[167:03.17]It's over here.
[167:03.91]Alright, you need to patrol or something.
[167:18.19]Mine with the dog?
[167:19.07]I can't.
[167:20.45]He doesn't have opposable thumbs.
[167:22.50]He can't do it.
[167:27.12]Oh no, he's got the zoomies.
[167:29.76]Did I get something?
[167:37.10]Why did I stop?
[167:48.69]I'm doing fine.
[167:49.37]I kind of have to get this, right?
[168:08.63]Yeah, this is like the point of the game.
[168:12.87]You just are a piece of shit, and you can't do anything.
[168:33.22]You should find a town before mining.
[168:34.77]Well, I almost have one copper bar that I'm gonna get ripped off of my person.
[168:46.60]It's taking me almost a full day, come on.
[168:54.10]Paladins, we're fine.
[169:00.14]Which one is this again?
[169:02.12]Copper, got it.
[169:04.24]Average price, 100.
[169:04.86]Uh, thank you.
[169:07.85]Yep.
[169:09.49]Valuable metal used in high-tech machinery.
[169:13.47]Get another one?
[169:19.14]Mercenary plate?
[169:19.94]Where did I get this?
[169:20.64]Oh, right.
[169:24.63]That was so pointless.
[169:26.79]No, there's... I'm gonna get three.
[169:30.15]Okay?
[169:37.01]There's no room?
[169:38.50]I can move.
[169:39.22]I'm a Diablo II veteran, guys.
[169:41.78]I'll make room.
[169:52.38]They say no more room.
[170:13.01]Where is the- Stalling streamer.
[170:17.75]We- This is part of- I have to do this shit.
[170:19.89]I gotta- It's not like I'm just gonna skip this.
[170:25.32]Let's take a look at the mining level.
[170:32.04]Alright, we got combat range, thievery, sciences, trades.
[170:38.72]Uh, is it even on here?
[170:40.98]Field medic?
[170:43.06]Laboring?
[170:44.04]Laboring.
[170:44.84]Okay.
[170:50.04]Laboring 9.
[170:51.00]I'm very good.
[170:52.92]Scale a general manual labor such as mining and using simple machinery.
[171:02.77]Level 10, coming up.
[171:04.89]Ways to train, work hard.
[171:17.54]I'm making up for all the slave work that I did not do.
[171:28.04]If I get this game, I can start the game as a slave and work my way to freedom.
[171:31.55]Yes.
[171:33.81]You're not supposed to do anything good in this game.
[171:36.89]You're supposed to be an ant of a person.
[171:44.27]And not only am I doing this, I'm doing this with full armor on.
[171:46.86]Did somebody say this joke sucks?
[171:56.88]What joke?
[171:58.16]This is the game.
[171:58.82]This is the stream, man.
[171:59.86]We're fucking mining for copper bars.
[172:06.17]Alright, how close am I?
[172:11.37]Got one.
[172:12.81]Alright, one more.
[172:15.80]I can get rid of this hat.
[172:17.12]I don't need this.
[172:18.42]Value, 10 cents.
[172:20.24]No thanks.
[172:20.64]These things are like 180 bucks.
[172:41.55]Please stop.
[172:42.23]This is not a bit.
[172:43.25]I'm mining for materials.
[172:46.17]I need the materials I'm not doing like a look at how long I've been sitting here for it not fucking hilarious No, I'm trying doing I'm trying to get three punk copper bars so I can use them how they're intended to smash somebody over the head with them because they're just big rocks and then throw them in the trash and
[173:12.13]Okay, we're done.
[173:12.65]That's it.
[173:16.24]I got what I wanted.
[173:17.22]I got three dinosaur eggs.
[173:19.31]My three dragons.
[173:48.42]They're going to net you 10 copper?
[173:51.09]Why- no, look at the price!
[173:52.55]194 cents.
[173:54.35]Is there a cave up here?
[174:07.78]Put a facecam on to replace world's end.
[174:19.11]Go south, not north, I beg you.
[174:23.09]Stop acting like an idiot.
[174:25.35]Alright, look.
[174:27.29]I want to make this really clear.
[174:30.51]I don't know what's up here.
[174:33.15]If you do, I don't have that information.
[174:36.71]How would I have that information?
[174:40.23]Because I'm going this way.
[174:44.43]No, go this way!
[174:45.37]I know what's down here!
[174:48.02]I don't- what?
[174:52.12]I know that there's, like, evil demons up here, but, like, I can't go this way?
[175:00.32]Why can't I go, like, over here?
[175:02.78]I have to go down here.
[175:04.24]Why can't I go over here?
[175:12.19]They told me not to go up this way, but, like, I'm not going this way.
[175:15.67]I'm going, like, this way.
[175:17.85]I'm going from here to here.
[175:27.61]You know what I mean?
[175:28.17]Like, I'm not, like, going up there.
[175:29.81]I'm going, like, down there.
[175:34.25]That's the plan.
[175:40.93]No, but I want it to, like, wrap around here, though.
[175:43.49]I want to, like, go this way.
[175:45.31]Because there's a lake here.
[175:46.39]There's, like, a river and shit.
[175:47.68]I want to see what this is.
[175:53.62]Look, I understand this is one of those games where, like, there's no way I could know where anything is.
[176:00.70]And if I'm going to stumble upon something fucking weird, that's what's going to happen.
[176:04.00]I don't need to know, like, exactly where to go.
[176:08.76]There's no information in the game besides, like, when people tell you, you know what I mean?
[176:16.53]Look, his world's end.
[176:18.49]I want to see what this is.
[176:38.95]He doesn't know where everything is.
[176:40.09]Because there's the guard post, right?
[176:51.88]Pick up the dog and carry the dog.
[177:01.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[177:01.81]Not all these are holy servants, that's fine.
[177:12.65]Alright, hold on.
[177:14.52]So, what is this?
[177:15.60]Is this all the way up here?
[177:17.82]Am I going to scale this whole mountain?
[177:28.52]Oh, hold on.
[177:30.48]Important.
[177:46.50]This is not going to take as long.
[177:56.66]Put your facecam over the character's face.
[178:15.55]I don't even... Hold on.
[178:16.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[178:17.61]I can't even bring it back now.
[178:21.25]My hands are off.
[178:21.85]I can't even do anything.
[178:30.32]Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[178:31.50]Really?
[178:36.16]I'm all the way at, like, the edge of the map.
[178:37.58]I can't even move.
[178:48.31]Got it.
[178:48.51]Okay.
[178:51.44]Where was I running?
[178:53.08]Did I get the material?
[178:55.04]Oh, fuck.
[178:55.58]I don't have any room for this shit.
[178:56.82]Alright, hold on.
[179:18.10]There, better?
[179:18.96]We good?
[179:30.17]Why is that so funny?
[179:45.11]I don't have enough inventory space for this shit.
[179:46.77]Hold on.
[179:47.61]What can I do with this?
[179:51.18]I can move this over here.
[179:52.12]Hold on.
[179:52.44]I got it.
[179:52.74]I got it.
[179:52.96]I got it.
[179:57.90]They stack.
[179:59.32]No, they don't.
[180:05.17]Fuck.
[180:05.51]Okay.
[180:08.67]Just scared the shit out of me.
[180:12.68]I can't carry this anymore.
[180:13.94]How much is this worth?
[180:15.50]32.
[180:16.08]No, why would I just... What happened?
[180:19.72]Okay.
[180:22.24]This is worth a lot.
[180:24.14]That's worth 1,700.
[180:33.78]Backpack?
[180:34.20]I don't have a backpack, though.
[180:37.74]Like, I don't have a backpack.
[180:41.21]I can't put anything in my backpack.
[180:42.33]I don't have one.
[180:44.55]The dog inventory.
[180:45.41]I don't think he can carry them.
[180:57.62]What can the dog have on his back?
[181:01.24]The dog is dying.
[181:02.44]Feed the dog!
[181:05.96]I don't have any food to feed the dog.
[181:09.58]Oh, shit.
[181:10.40]Okay, hold on.
[181:11.00]I gotta get one more fucking rock.
[181:16.78]Alright, let's go.
[181:24.49]Where the hell?
[181:26.79]This is so far away.
[181:27.99]Do I have any- Can I eat anything?
[181:33.05]I spend all the time mining and not getting any food.
[181:38.22]There is a town up here.
[181:39.84]Let's go.
[181:40.44]Quickly.
[181:55.61]Come on, we're gonna get you some food, dog!
[182:04.39]You're okay.
[182:04.96]You're alright.
[182:05.38]You're gonna be fine.
[182:07.52]I just gotta get you up here.
[182:19.51]Go on.
[182:33.05]What was that?
[182:33.63]I just saw something on the screen.
[182:38.65]Put a picture of Otto on the dog portrait.
[182:40.23]No, because if this dog dies, I'm going to be sad because it was supposed to be Otto.
[182:42.95]No.
[182:46.88]I feel like I'm losing my grip on the dog.
[182:58.00]I need to eat, too.
[183:00.59]Bad.
[183:02.59]There's a town up here.
[183:05.51]Somewhere up here.
[183:09.91]Don't tell me I have to scale the entire mountain.
[183:21.85]How high up is this place?
[183:23.95]I'm at almost zero.
[183:24.83]I'm going to pass out.
[183:39.45]Should I throw off the armor?
[183:48.26]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[183:49.72]I'm almost there.
[183:50.40]I'm almost at the front door.
[183:57.14]61, 98, we're good.
[183:59.28]Just get me up there.
[184:06.38]Throw away armor.
[184:07.80]I'm right there.
[184:08.62]Look at this.
[184:09.20]I'm standing in front of the gates.
[184:18.44]The weight is doubling your hunger rate.
[184:20.04]That's alright, though.
[184:20.60]It's giving me extra power, extra points.
[184:24.02]I am persevering through this shit.
[184:25.88]And it's gonna give me more points in the long run.
[184:28.24]Here we go.
[184:28.60]Alright, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it.
[184:34.01]These are tech hunters.
[184:36.51]Okay.
[184:37.41]Look, I got a fucking sick dog here!
[184:44.21]Okay, what can I... Save it, just in case something horrible happens.
[184:56.13]Anybody?
[184:56.79]I can just come in here?
[184:57.63]Okay, they're not gonna, like, throw me in a dungeon or anything, right?

[185:11.43]Bar.
[185:19.84]Okay, let's get in here.
[185:24.02]Sell the armor to this guy.
[185:25.36]Okay.

[186:17.98]We gotta sell it all.
[186:21.66]I need money.
[186:27.20]And take this fucking dumb weapon, too.
[186:31.43]Maybe I should sell this.
[186:32.21]What do you think?
[186:37.15]I think I'm going to sell the armor as well.
[186:41.79]But I need food first.
[186:44.31]Dog needs it now.
[186:45.02]Let's go.
[186:45.36]Okay, I need... I need like a general store.
[187:00.09]Alright, the bar.

[187:05.11]I don't...
[187:15.52]The dog's up, the dog is up, the dog is okay.
[187:18.16]I'm only unconscious for 15 seconds.
[187:26.43]Alright, come on.
[187:28.39]Come on, just crawl to the bar and buy a fucking pretzel.
[187:33.37]Go, go, go.

[187:45.53]I just clicked a fucking ad on a webpage.
[187:48.59]Alright, I need a bar.
[187:49.91]Bartender?

[188:21.24]Uh, show me your goods.
[188:22.00]Here we go.
[188:22.44]Alright.
[188:22.84]Bread, cheese, meat, tacos, meat wrap.
[188:25.90]How much is this?
[188:30.73]It's 316 for the meat wraps?
[188:33.55]How much is bread?
[188:36.59]This is so much money.
[188:38.13]How much do I even have?
[188:40.29]13... Okay, hold on.
[188:45.55]Meat and bread.
[188:48.33]Okay, I just ate it.
[188:51.89]I don't have enough money.
[188:52.57]Okay, where's the dog?
[188:56.62]Come here, dog.
[189:06.73]Where's the dog?
[189:08.43]Come here!
[189:14.85]Eat it!
[189:15.85]How do I feed the dog?
[189:26.56]Did you get it?
[189:26.94]You got it.
[189:27.68]Okay, we're good.
[189:34.68]You're three times idling right now.
[189:37.86]They've both eaten.
[189:39.61]They're both hungry still, but it's okay.
[189:42.35]I need to make some more money.
[189:48.73]Now let's go back up here.
[189:50.79]I gotta sell some more stuff, I think.
[189:58.78]I can't, like, hold on the Alt key to steal.
[190:00.90]I'm not doing that.
[190:02.46]Alright, talk to.
[190:03.18]Let's trade.
[190:04.64]Um.
[190:08.18]Dried meat is so, so much cheaper than everything else.
[190:17.01]And I spent 300 fucking dollars when I could have just bought this.
[190:23.62]Hey!
[190:23.94]Are you stealing my dog?
[190:25.98]Why are you taking my dog?
[190:29.45]What?
[190:29.81]What's going on?
[190:34.49]What's happening?
[190:39.74]Oh, no.
[190:49.12]The dog's not allowed inside?
[190:50.49]Alright, so they've eaten.
[190:59.44]Okay, we're good.
[191:03.68]Bodyguard.
[191:08.30]Here.
[191:08.94]Eat it.
[191:12.82]Eat the meat.
[191:17.30]Do they not want it right now?
[191:22.92]I think they're okay.
[191:24.83]So, do you only have to eat just one time?
[191:27.43]Eat for yourself.
[191:27.97]I already did.
[191:29.80]I already ate earlier.
[191:30.48]I guess can you eat more than one time to speed up?
[191:34.66]I already ate.
[191:37.51]Load the game and buy all the cheap shit.
[191:42.93]It was poisoned.
[191:48.55]The dog keeps passing out and waking up.
[191:52.94]I bought expensive fucking food.
[191:57.57]You can't eat until the bar stops.
[191:59.11]Yeah, that makes sense.
[191:59.73]Alright.
[192:06.84]I got an idea.
[192:14.56]It's worth doing.
[192:15.88]I don't care.
[192:39.41]There's so much shit to take.
[192:42.34]Chew sticks.
[192:46.00]Nobody can see me right now.
[192:49.60]Alright, we got Saki.
[192:51.68]Took it.

[193:13.80]Chewsticks.
[193:14.68]Chewsticks.
[193:15.91]I can't pick that up.
[193:16.65]Are you too far away?
[193:20.47]Am I visible?
[193:21.43]No.
[193:21.83]Chewsticks.
[193:24.77]Why do I... What did I pick?
[193:25.51]I'm gonna go sell this.
[193:27.82]This water jug is huge.
[193:32.78]Okay, I got food.
[193:35.10]Chewsticks.
[193:36.84]Meat.
[193:37.54]Sake.
[193:39.59]Let's go sell the hacksaw back to the person that I just came here from.
[193:45.72]No, actually, I can't do that because they know.
[193:49.46]How many times have you... This dog keeps passing out and waking up.
[193:56.89]Fuck.
[193:59.45]Nobody can see this.
[194:02.21]Alright, let me get up.
[194:14.23]I don't have enough money, but I'm not going to sell to you.
[194:17.37]Let's do business, it'll say, right?
[194:22.29]Stolen from you.

[194:29.01]I need to get that huge... I feel so bad for the dog.
[194:42.09]Alright, let's go.
[194:48.29]Still, the hunger is still going up, though.
[194:52.17]So, eventually, the dog will be okay.
[195:02.76]Let's go sleep somewhere.
[195:05.36]You know what I mean?
[195:05.84]What do we got?
[195:08.64]This is armory.
[195:10.99]I'm gonna sell.
[195:11.57]I have to sell this.
[195:12.75]I have to.
[195:15.98]Because I just don't... Wait, everything's locked.
[195:18.66]That's a bar.
[195:24.15]We have an inn somewhere.
[195:30.51]Sell that guy the water from across the street.
[195:35.28]I mean, I can't really do that.
[195:40.18]It's a lot of bars, yeah.

[196:26.61]You are.
[196:29.31]What's the percentage chance that I can sell to you?
[196:34.35]Why am I going this far around?

[197:19.24]I need a backpack.
[197:22.43]Splint kit, chainmail sheets, wooden bowl.
[197:25.39]No.
[197:27.07]I'm just gonna have to... Here's what's gonna have to happen.
[197:29.73]I'm just gonna have to let the... I'm gonna have to sleep in the bar.
[197:33.28]And then, hopefully when we get up... Come on.
[197:39.82]I'll feel better.
[197:42.21]How much is a room at the inn?
[197:45.08]Is it expensive?
[197:45.88]Can I afford it?
[197:46.48]Or am I... Can I just sleep in here?
[197:53.12]Don't idle in x3 speed.
[197:54.62]I... Was I?
[197:58.55]I'd look... Sitting pillow.
[197:59.89]Okay, well I can't sleep in this, but... Maybe I can go upstairs?
[198:05.09]Are there beds upstairs?
[198:14.92]Where's the dog?
[198:16.74]Dog's fine.
[198:17.24]Okay, there are beds up here.
[198:24.13]Are they usable?
[198:25.45]Everyone just got up at the same time, as if they're about to all shout, like, STOP!
[198:33.21]It's 200 fucking C for a bed.
[198:48.95]I need more money.
[198:49.63]I need to... This is why I need to mine more shit.
[199:00.29]You just had to have those expensive sausages.
[199:02.81]I just didn't realize that they were... Everything was so expensive.
[199:09.15]Like, okay, my... The scale that I had there was sausages, and then bread was fucking 250 cents?! !
[199:20.24]I already- look.
[199:21.74]I already fed the dog!
[199:23.67]I can't feed him anymore!
[199:24.85]This is gonna have to do for now.
[199:38.54]Can I eat these?
[199:42.62]I- I- I can feed the dog more.
[199:52.14]Yeah, what are you guys talking about?
[199:54.90]No, you can't.
[199:56.08]Oh my god, I'm gonna get caught for stealing this because I just put it on the ground.
[199:59.22]Alright, I'm not gonna- I know what's going on!
[200:02.22]I know what's going on!
[200:10.57]There is a cooldown period when you eat.
[200:12.77]Ugh.
[200:40.65]So I just need to sit around.
[200:42.71]I need to find a place to sleep or hang out.
[200:45.01]Because I can't really go anywhere until this hunger thing wears off.
[201:00.18]Yeah, I have to abandon the bread because I can't pick it up.
[201:03.98]If I pick it up, this guy's going to see me do that and I stole it.
[201:20.03]You don't need to sleep now.
[201:20.83]It's for recovery.
[201:21.63]So that doesn't make hunger go up faster if you sleep.
[201:23.95]Like, it doesn't make it go up.
[201:28.23]Alright, I'm gonna tell... You just... Forget about all these jobs.
[201:32.02]You need to hang out somewhere.
[201:34.08]Just, like, go sit over here and relax.
[201:36.66]I'm gonna go out, and I'm gonna mine a few more times, and I'm gonna bring the... I'm gonna... Just you hang out over here.
[201:42.86]Just you stay.
[201:47.56]I'm gonna go, and I'm gonna take care of this.
[201:52.82]Just throw the... This thing's huge.
[201:54.33]I don't want it.
[201:55.55]I need room for fucking mining things.
[201:58.71]Back to the mines.
[201:59.37]Let's go.
[202:08.98]He's gonna starve?
[202:09.74]No, he's not.
[202:12.08]There was a mine right out here.
[202:18.61]It was like right... Where was it?
[202:19.97]Out here?
[202:23.55]Oh, like the back door, side door, or where was that mining thing?
[202:29.87]There might be another vein just sitting over here somewhere.
[202:34.28]Why do I walk so slowly?
[202:35.22]Because I'm building up my strength right now.
[202:39.94]The heavier shit that I wear... So, if I go over here... See, strength... Is at 17 right now.
[202:49.71]It's because I keep wearing this heavy ass armor.
[202:59.26]So let me take a look and see where that vein is.
[203:02.75]There is the other side.
[203:05.07]Wasn't it like down here?
[203:10.43]Where was that vein?
[203:21.64]Other side?
[203:28.50]Uh, what the hell is this?
[203:30.78]That's, like, where he is.
[203:31.74]Okay.
[203:34.86]I wish I could pull the camera out a little bit further.
[203:38.25]Because it's kind of hard to see anything.
[203:41.95]See how, like, the... See what's happening here?
[203:43.69]It's just, like, the camera's, like, freaking out every time I get to, like, a divot.
[203:48.04]Uh, alright.
[203:51.98]Come on.
[203:57.15]Can't go any further.
[203:58.47]Was it down here?
[203:59.23]I think it was down here, right?
[204:15.92]I hope that... I hope I'm clicking on this.
[204:24.43]I'm not sure if I'm actually clicking here.
[204:27.13]Or if I'm getting blocked by the, uh... No, it looks like I am.
[204:31.09]Yeah, I got it.
[204:31.59]Okay.
[204:36.22]Alright.
[204:37.80]I need to mine at that vein that's down here somewhere.
[204:40.72]Where the hell is it?
[204:53.19]I feel like it was right here.
[204:55.35]Maybe a little further back?
[204:58.61]There it is.
[204:59.63]Alright, just let me mine here.
[205:08.54]So, give information on the richness of resources.
[205:10.70]Prospect.
[205:14.58]Zone arm of a green environment.
[205:16.50]Wait, what?
[205:18.11]Resources.
[205:18.69]Water.
[205:19.37]Iron.
[205:21.95]Fertility.
[205:22.75]Copper.
[205:23.77]So, this is just... That's what prospecting does.
[205:26.15]Just shows it.
[205:26.63]Okay.
[205:26.75]Okay.
[205:30.42]Well, get over there and mine it.
[205:34.80]How's the dog doing?
[205:36.32]Oh, goddammit, the dog needs to eat.
[205:38.54]What if- what if I run the dog over the bread?
[205:40.82]While I just sit here and do this?
[205:43.34]I drop the bread right here.
[205:44.92]Ready?
[205:46.18]Is he gonna get mad about this?
[205:47.47]I'm just a- I'm a fucking dog.
[206:00.65]It's right in front of you, just eat it.
[206:07.60]Dogs don't eat bread.
[206:14.44]Give me this.
[206:20.40]I'm filling my whole bag.
[206:27.24]Dogs absolutely eat bread.
[206:29.81]Don't worry, I'm gonna buy a bunch of those beef jerky's and we're gonna eat like kings.
[206:36.57]Throw away the cactus.
[206:41.43]That sells for a lot.
[206:43.77]This thing's stupid.
[206:52.54]You think I'm kidding, I'm filling my whole bag.
[206:57.72]I'll be back, don't worry, he's gonna be fine.
[207:08.27]Mining music?
[207:10.75]Uh, fine.
[207:11.30]I'll put on some mining music.
[208:03.79]I'm coming!
[208:05.87]I'll get you your food, I'm coming!
[208:16.46]Come on, just get a few more pieces of iron!
[208:20.87]Just get a few more pieces of iron!
[208:44.75]Alright, that's good.
[208:52.12]Alright.
[208:52.80]Fuck off.
[208:53.26]Let's go.
[208:58.79]Go.
[208:59.61]Hurry.
[209:16.50]When I was doing that, somebody said, you are so not funny.
[209:22.64]That wasn't even my call.
[209:24.15]That was, people told me to do that.
[209:25.91]That wasn't even my joke.
[209:27.57]That wasn't even my call.
[209:46.81]Alright, get in there.
[209:48.43]This should be enough for me to buy a bunch of food, and then... I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do then.
[209:58.49]Where's the dog?
[210:02.70]It's alright.
[210:08.96]This dog has passed out and woken up.
[210:12.86]Like, 30 times.
[210:13.26]Maybe 50 times.
[210:17.68]How far away am I?
[210:19.30]Hurry up!
[210:23.94]Get in, get in, get in, get in.
[210:26.08]Alright, bar, there it is.
[210:26.99]Okay, quickly, come on.
[210:36.61]Buy a shitload of those meat sticks.
[210:46.89]Talk to.
[210:47.70]Trade.
[210:48.82]Show me what you got.
[210:49.82]I got these rocks.
[210:55.06]And I would like to buy from you dried meat.
[211:02.06]And... That's it.
[211:10.05]That's all I can afford.
[211:12.49]Alright, dog.
[211:13.13]Come on.
[211:22.66]Where are you?
[211:24.12]Alright, I need a reunion here.
[211:25.10]Come on.
[211:31.02]Come on!
[211:32.00]Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat!
[211:35.25]I made it.
[211:37.83]Okay.
[211:40.13]Trade.
[211:41.39]Here.
[211:43.29]No, never mind.
[211:48.03]Just gotta wait till you wake back up.
[211:53.35]Eat that food.
[212:15.75]Got it.
[212:19.51]Okay.
[212:21.67]Now, I'm going to leave you with a piece of meat here.
[212:26.92]So when you get hungry again, you eat that.
[212:28.96]But I have to go back over there, and I need to mine... I need to mine again, so you eat that when you're ready.
[212:41.20]You just hang out there and eat that when you're ready.
[212:43.33]Let me save.
[212:53.72]This is just going to be the rest of the stream.
[212:55.36]But this is what you have to do.
[212:56.82]It's about survival.
[213:05.47]Alright.
[213:08.31]Where... I just keep forgetting where the fuck I was going before.
[213:12.54]All these rocks.
[213:15.54]Where's the prospector?
[213:19.79]Stone... No, there is none.
[213:22.15]Is there... Is there none over there again?
[213:23.67]There's so much more to the game.
[213:29.99]There's more... Oh, I know.
[213:35.38]But you can't just go see it all.
[213:37.44]You need to start from a piece of crap that can't even afford to buy dried meat leaves.
[213:47.51]You can build your own cities.
[213:50.17]Yeah, that's fucking awesome.
[213:58.17]Alright.
[214:01.07]So, while he's relaxing, I really do need to figure out where the hell I was gonna go.
[214:07.70]Because I can't just run out into the wilderness again.
[214:13.14]Let's go down here.
[214:17.31]What is this?
[214:18.31]Is there something over there?
[214:26.49]Are you winning?
[214:27.11]Uh, not yet.
[214:32.01]Strength is at... Let's find out.
[214:35.75]Strength is at 18.
[214:46.68]Uh, keep going.
[214:48.20]Back down here.
[214:50.74]Dog is still eating.
[214:57.85]I don't know if mining is the best, most lucrative way to get money for your sick dog.
[215:02.96]Well, it's the only thing I got right now.
[215:16.58]Let's do it!
[215:18.49]Now I can fill my backpack.
[215:28.35]Man and dog is secret hard mode.
[215:29.88]You have to feed two mouths right away.
[215:32.04]I didn't even think about it like that.
[215:37.30]That's true.
[215:37.74]I didn't even think about that.
[215:46.87]Put on the mining music.
[215:48.78]No, somebody didn't like that, so I'm not doing it.
[216:01.50]One guy, yeah?
[216:16.65]How much is in this vein?
[216:21.45]I mean... Condition... The building is in good condition.
[216:24.77]Iron quality, 100.
[216:25.53]Can I have up to three workers here?
[216:31.70]Efficiency.
[216:32.88]Max efficiency.
[216:37.60]I'm going to be iron rich.
[216:45.61]Just build your shack next to the ore.
[216:49.79]That's a pretty great idea.
[216:54.53]Can I build my house right here?
[217:02.85]Is the point of the game to be boring?
[217:04.55]I don't think this is particularly boring.
[217:12.66]I think the point of the game is you kind of have to, very painfully, start from zero.
[217:34.18]You gotta earn your place at the top.
[217:37.06]By... having your dog... Did you eat the food that was here?
[217:41.34]What happened to the food?
[217:42.18]Did you already eat it?
[217:45.67]What happened to the food that I put down here?
[217:53.75]Did somebody take it?
[217:59.21]Someone stole the food.
[218:03.14]Well, I'll be back in a minute.
[218:25.86]Why would you expect the game to have the dog auto-eat the food?
[218:28.68]I don't know, I figured he would smell it and it'd be in front of him.
[218:42.12]Come on, I'm just gonna get a few more.
[218:43.40]Because I don't want to do this again.
[218:45.24]I want to continue my journey going... to where I wanted to go.
[218:52.98]I'm- hold on, I can move this.
[218:58.35]What do you think, guys?
[218:58.97]Full stack?
[219:00.44]I can't even do a full stack.
[219:08.14]He's like starving again.
[219:09.72]I'm doing just fine.
[219:21.17]Get a backpack before going?
[219:22.43]Yeah, that's what I'll do.
[219:24.31]I'm gonna buy a few more pieces of jerky.
[219:26.25]The dog needs to eat again.
[219:29.25]This really is just... the dog is becoming... What is this?
[219:37.73]Only two more and we're done.
[219:42.93]The dog is draining you.
[219:46.33]Look at the amount of work that I have to do to keep this dog around.
[219:52.35]See how hard I work?
[219:54.03]I don't want to lose him.
[220:00.06]Abandon the dog.
[220:00.88]I can't abandon the dog.
[220:02.36]He's gonna eat all my beef jerky, but it's gonna be whatever.
[220:14.03]I can't make the dog work.
[220:15.19]The dog doesn't have any skills.
[220:17.81]Alright, let's go.
[220:24.05]Get up there.
[220:26.81]He actually did eat the food.
[220:27.73]I'm at x3 speed.
[220:32.02]Oh, let's go.
[220:32.94]Get it up there.
[220:39.69]Make the dog have a job.
[220:43.79]I'm not sure it's possible.
[220:47.17]Hurry.
[220:52.76]He's starting to pause the game while idling.
[220:55.32]PogChamp.
[221:00.58]Strike check.
[221:01.28]Let's take a look.
[221:04.74]19.
[221:10.14]Look how terrible everything else is.
[221:12.16]How do I get toughness?
[221:15.45]I don't know.
[221:15.81]26 in laboring.
[221:27.61]I have to get beat up for toughness.
[221:31.81]So people have to kick the shit out of me for me to... okay.
[221:35.07]This should give me enough food.
[221:36.03]This is gonna be, like, one, two, three, four, five, six... this should be about... alright.
[221:41.46]How much is a backpack?
[221:58.75]Alt F4 from this awful MMO.
[222:02.47]No, that's... You got the wrong idea.
[222:04.59]Look.
[222:06.05]Just because I'm mining ore to feed my starving dog that's passing out every 30 seconds.
[222:11.61]No.
[222:12.51]There's not... There's like... Just wait till I build my own city.
[222:16.64]Didn't you see the back of the box?
[222:22.26]Where am I going?
[222:22.86]I'm going the wrong way.
[222:32.06]Alright, buy more food.
[222:33.10]Actually, I don't... Yeah, I do.
[222:34.60]Do I have any... I've been eating it.
[222:39.01]So, food.
[222:42.55]Get on in.
[222:50.00]Let's do business.
[222:50.62]Alright, I'm gonna get 97 for these.
[222:59.13]Alright.
[222:59.85]Give me... So this is dried meat.
[223:04.61]Is there anything else cheaper here?
[223:06.17]Am I about to buy up the whole entire place?
[223:11.68]$7.37.
[223:11.76]I need a backpack.
[223:13.60]Bull backpack!
[223:18.54]I can't afford that one.
[223:22.68]I'm gonna buy up every bar.
[223:26.74]Of their fucking...
[223:29.46]Slim Jim's alright come here you come with me Unconscious of 20 seconds and then eat that
[223:55.91]Hey, ate the dried meat.
[223:56.81]Good.
[223:57.03]Now relax.
[223:59.41]I keep- I'm just treading water with this dog.
[224:10.13]Okay.
[224:11.73]Let's go to the other bar.
[224:21.44]Do you have a backpack I can buy that's cheaper?
[224:26.21]Sleeping bag.
[224:27.03]No, you got like dried meat.
[224:30.23]Should I just... I don't know.
[224:34.46]Okay, should I just buy a bunch more meat and then... Or should I get a backpack?
[224:47.67]There's a cheap backpack right here.
[224:54.34]Sell pants and armor.
[224:55.96]Buy trader's backpack.
[224:58.16]I did it.
[224:58.74]I did it.
[224:59.16]Somebody said to do it and I did it.
[225:00.12]I need the money.
[225:11.99]I desperately need this money.
[225:20.96]Alright, so.
[225:22.58]I stole that shit anyways.
[225:23.84]I can steal it again.
[225:24.71]So I can get a sleeping bag.
[225:27.85]A scavenger's basket.
[225:33.31]A cheap and useful backpack commonly associated with peasants and scavengers.
[225:38.08]Get it?
[225:41.06]You didn't need to sell the pants.
[225:45.16]I'm gonna buy some more meat.
[225:56.61]Okay.
[225:58.74]I'm going to save some money.
[226:06.50]Don't sell the chess piece.
[226:07.80]Well, I can't.
[226:09.98]I did it.
[226:11.00]I bought the shitty one.
[226:13.93]What's wrong with the shitty one?
[226:15.23]It still works.
[226:16.13]You put stuff in it.
[226:24.86]Alright, I got- what is this?
[226:26.71]It's actually a drum on my back.
[226:32.09]I just turned into a different character.
[226:33.75]Ooh.
[226:41.64]Look at this, we're just getting started with this game.
[226:43.76]You see this?
[226:45.62]Look!
[226:47.58]Are you lo- are you looking?
[226:49.12]Are you looking?
[226:59.82]Alright, let's go.
[227:01.87]Dog, I'm going to carry the dog.
[227:05.97]You can stack in backpacks.
[227:11.11]What?
[227:15.95]Let's go to the adventure shop.
[227:22.20]There's like a mechanic.
[227:23.00]Let's go over here.
[227:26.72]What's this?
[227:27.78]Armorer.
[227:29.76]Here.
[227:31.70]You can stack in the trader's backpack.
[227:35.30]Well, that's not the trader's backpack.
[227:39.76]Are you looking at this?
[227:53.87]Medium backpack.
[227:58.58]glorious holy map small backpack uh do you have any no trader backpacks that's fine I'm okay with my drum cheap useful backpack I'm not just I'm just getting started I've just started the game
[228:21.02]Alright, what about, uh, standard first aid kits?
[228:23.74]I have a basic first aid kit.
[228:25.66]Do you sell basics?
[228:27.58]Who ate that?
[228:28.41]Did she just eat that out of my... Who just ate that?
[228:31.93]Somebody did.
[228:32.43]I did.
[228:32.67]Okay, I'm gonna say let's get some basic first aid kits.
[228:40.02]Who is... What's happening right now?
[228:42.42]Did the dog just eat?
[228:47.26]Give the dog a backpack.
[228:53.60]Small backpack.
[228:54.42]I don't have enough money.
[228:57.36]I need first aid.
[228:58.16]I gotta keep myself.
[228:59.42]Okay.
[229:02.33]Doggy backpack.
[229:03.33]I can't afford it.
[229:04.17]I have a 21% chance.
[229:12.08]Why is there a bird inside of this building?
[229:18.28]No, I can't do it.
[229:39.93]I'm not selling the dog.
[229:41.11]The bird.
[229:45.85]What's in here?
[230:04.09]Oh, come on.
[230:06.21]Is there nothing in here?
[230:13.26]Oh, fuck you, Gibby.
[230:18.74]What happened?
[230:19.33]What?
[230:19.55]Did I just burp?
[230:37.28]I let out, like, a huge belt.
[230:42.00]Oh.
[230:49.57]33%.
[230:49.59]Come on, that's a third.
[230:51.89]If I gave you a $100 bill and said, hey, there's a 33% chance that that's going to turn into $300.
[230:57.38]But there's also a 66% chance that it's going to go to zero.
[231:00.56]You're going to take that bet.
[231:02.76]You are.
[231:15.02]What is up here?
[231:15.86]Look at all this stuff.
[231:19.50]There's so many machines in here.
[231:20.76]Gears.
[231:24.49]What?
[231:28.05]800 cents to skeletal repair the dog.
[231:54.32]I need all the food I can get.
[231:55.46]Alright, let's go.
[232:03.30]Dog's out of food?
[232:05.28]Am I already actually out of food?
[232:06.70]No, I got lots.
[232:07.88]I got plenty.
[232:11.07]Dog's gonna be just fine.
[232:11.99]Gonna take a stroll.
[232:15.29]I don't need to sneak anymore.
[232:22.29]Very stealthy with a drum on your back.
[232:26.00]I'm fine.
[232:27.23]Okay.
[232:28.77]Now, I gotta pee.
[232:31.31]It's been like four hours and I haven't peed once.
[232:33.47]I'm gonna piss.
[232:34.69]I'll be right back.
[232:36.45]We will continue the mission to survive.
[232:41.74]That's the only thing we're trying to do.
[232:43.74]I'll be right back.
[232:45.46]See you in two seconds.
[234:55.37]Alright.
[235:08.90]Ow!
[235:15.16]Is he still a slave?
[235:16.28]No, I changed because it was too hard.
[235:19.78]It was like, it was at the extreme of you start as nothing.
[235:26.73]Maybe one day that'd be fun for me to do.
[235:34.76]That's good.
[235:36.74]Okay, I like this game.
[235:41.28]Whoa.
[235:44.19]uh that's that's a hundred dollars from flim flam thank you flim flam for the hundred bucks oh snap is that a streamer that I hear uh it is it is thank you so much for the 100 dollars
[236:08.04]That's five or six pizzas?
[236:09.42]Well, that's, no, that's five or six, like, double, triple deals.
[236:12.76]From Pizza Hut or Domino's or something.
[236:16.04]It's like 20 bucks for two or three large pizzas.
[236:20.02]That's pretty great.
[236:27.96]But thank you so much.
[236:28.68]That's a lot of money.
[236:30.24]What was I doing?
[236:36.84]But it is a streamer.
[236:38.66]Or, I don't know.
[236:41.24]Just kind of a guy right here.
[236:42.93]You found a blueprint.
[236:44.77]Blueprints allow you to learn tech instantly.
[236:46.61]To learn a blueprint, open your inventory and right-click it to learn it.
[236:50.49]If you're wearing a backpack, make sure to close it first so that the blueprint doesn't switch between your inventory and your backpack.
[236:55.08]Okay.
[236:59.82]Chewsticks.
[237:05.58]I can learn how to chew on sticks.
[237:11.55]Cool it with the slurping.
[237:14.39]I know, people, like, hate that shit.
[237:15.67]I'm sorry.
[237:16.19]I, like, just do it out of... because it sounds fun to me.
[237:25.86]How's the dog doing?
[237:26.58]Almost... okay?
[237:33.14]Stop slurping.
[237:33.74]It's rude.
[237:35.71]Well, you know, there are some cultures where slurping is actually a sign of happiness and being well taken care of, especially if you're at a restaurant.
[237:46.78]It's actually seen as a sign of respect.
[238:00.78]That's soup!
[238:06.62]I just know that information.
[238:07.96]I'm not saying that I'm going to do it.
[238:13.57]Look, can I just carry... I know that's true because I... I'm not just making it up.
[238:35.15]Noodles equals soup.
[238:46.55]Where am I going to take my fucking dog?
[238:50.15]Why am I still carrying the dog?
[238:51.26]Because I want the dog to be able to rest because the dog is currently starving and unconscious.
[238:58.66]So I'm trying to do my best.
[239:01.76]I'm not supposed to be idling like that.
[239:04.73]Open up the map.
[239:06.43]Continue with what I was going to do.
[239:07.83]Remember this town exists because... I'm going to keep... I'm going to go to the river.
[239:14.47]Alright.
[239:16.21]On the way to the river, I got some food.
[239:25.42]The dog has just been suffering this whole time.
[239:29.16]It's okay.
[239:29.54]I got a box full of food.
[239:33.31]I have a big college laundry bag full of snacks to eat.
[239:41.25]So he can just rest on my shoulder and eat out of the bag.
[239:51.28]Let's move.
[239:54.54]I think- did I just break his neck?
[239:56.50]Let's just- okay, hold on.
[240:01.08]I thought I just went too fast and I snapped his neck.
[240:05.28]Holy shit.
[240:06.72]Alright.
[240:10.78]I am no longer hungry.
[240:15.21]Let's go back to running.
[240:20.87]Okay.
[240:22.70]Dog is still on cooldown.
[240:29.75]Can I do anything else?
[240:31.19]Anybody else that wants to trade?
[240:32.43]Do I have any other people that want to join my cause here of surviving?
[240:39.88]I don't think so.
[240:40.48]But I'm ready to go out into the wilderness.
[240:41.82]He'll heal eventually.
[240:42.74]I'm going to keep him up here hanging out.
[240:45.06]Let's go to the river.
[240:57.04]We got a save.
[240:57.80]Auto save is right here.
[241:14.93]The backpack is bigger than me.
[241:17.45]Yes, it kind of is.
[241:22.28]Now, I'm starting to learn the ropes a little.
[241:24.76]I'm enjoying this.
[241:25.84]I feel like this is the kind of game that you could just dunk 500 hours in.
[241:47.56]Yeah, you put a lot of time into this game.
[241:50.88]Can you train the dog?
[241:51.80]I have no idea.
[241:54.04]But the dog is just barely now able to not be unconscious.
[242:04.49]Is the game worth it?
[242:09.87]That depends on what you want out of it.
[242:12.54]You know?
[242:13.62]Because take a look, right?
[242:15.38]If you just want to walk around and there are no rules to the game.
[242:19.72]It says it on the back of the box.
[242:23.00]If you just want to play a game where your character sucks and you can walk around anywhere on the map and there are no rules then sure.
[242:38.02]Some people will probably say, I don't want to do that, that sounds kind of boring, and I don't want to just be like a useless idiot the whole game.
[242:45.69]Well, I mean, then this game's not for you.
[242:55.86]What a fan of Fallout liked this game.
[242:59.44]The original, like Fallout 1 and 2, probably.
[243:13.28]I would say that would make some sense.
[243:20.46]Playing an NPC in a big world.
[243:22.20]Yeah, that kind of is what this is.
[243:25.54]How's the dog?
[243:26.84]Doing alright.
[243:29.54]It's like Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld.
[243:32.08]Yeah, because you can build cities.
[243:35.49]You don't have to do anything.
[243:39.01]You can walk around with an unconscious dog and look for weird shit to stare at.
[243:43.64]Well, you could build a city.
[243:47.15]It's kind of just up to you.
[243:51.71]You could go searching for demons in the northwest while... You're... Now turned into a rug of a dog somehow.
[244:03.15]Which is terrible.
[244:08.24]Because, like, look at him.
[244:14.45]breed the dog let me tell you hold on let's take a second here alright who just ate 105 how much more food do I have not enough but it's probably enough to get to the next area you could be a slave for two hours yeah that's exactly what happened they're very forgetting
[244:44.79]That character didn't even have an arm.
[244:47.37]So it was even harder.
[244:48.25]Alright, let me prospect here.
[244:53.52]What do we got?
[244:54.24]Stone.
[244:58.64]Hmm.
[245:02.74]Stone.
[245:03.24]You guys see any stone?
[245:09.62]Water stone.
[245:13.88]Hmm.
[245:19.55]I mean, there's stones all around me, but I don't know if it's worth stopping for.
[245:31.62]Whoa, alright.
[245:32.52]We're going all the way up this... Discovered Holy Farm.
[245:38.99]Can you fall off?
[245:42.13]I should probably be really careful here.
[245:48.43]Where am I now?
[245:50.60]I'm up on the mountain.
[245:58.89]Put on a chill OST?
[246:00.71]Alright, fine.
[246:02.29]That sounds like a good idea.
[246:05.73]How about, uh, what's a good, like, chill?
[246:09.76]Not Doom.
[246:19.46]Earthbound?
[246:21.56]Earthbound OST doesn't sound bad.
[246:23.00]Oh, let's go.
[246:31.05]What?
[246:31.73]That was not me.
[246:32.43]I didn't do that.
[246:32.89]That was the soundtrack.
[246:33.67]That was the Earthbound soundtrack.
[246:45.32]Alright, this looks good.
[246:49.77]What do you mean, sure?
[246:50.65]Look, listen.
[246:54.09]See?
[246:57.01]Everyone thinks that I'm doing that.
[247:03.63]I think I just crashed my browser by doing that too.
[247:07.78]Oh, what the fuck am I doing?
[247:12.44]Hey, there we go.
[247:13.10]Let's go.
[247:31.09]How you doing, dog?
[247:40.08]Uh, is this Earthbound or is this ToeJam & Earl?
[248:00.81]Nowhere.
[248:05.23]Holy shit.
[248:05.99]Where am I?
[248:06.51]Where do I go?
[248:07.15]I don't have a bunch of food.
[248:08.17]I only have like three.
[248:10.23]Oh, no.
[248:10.75]Two.
[248:13.02]And the dog's not even ready.
[248:14.04]Oh, watch this!
[248:24.84]Materials?
[248:26.07]What can I do with this?
[248:36.48]I don't think I have the necessary tool for this.
[248:45.31]No, nothing here.
[248:47.65]Dog's not ready to walk on his own.
[248:54.20]Ooh, got a camp.
[248:57.82]That will take me to... Where's the... Where's the... Where's the river?
[249:08.21]It's head that way.
[249:10.53]Kill the dog.
[249:11.23]I can't just kill the dog.
[249:17.37]You know, the last three hours, or no, probably like two hours of this game, has been making sure this dog stays alive.
[249:30.56]Let the dog go on a spy mission to camp.
[249:32.36]The dog can't even walk.
[249:36.61]So, the...
[249:39.50]That's not gonna happen.
[249:48.01]That's a long way down.
[249:51.75]I'm gonna get jumped over here or something, aren't I?
[249:55.72]What?
[249:57.66]What the hell was that?
[250:00.12]That was weird.
[250:00.70]Okay.
[250:04.76]Some more materials.
[250:09.37]He can walk now, but I don't want him to.
[250:10.77]I want him to get to at least halfway.
[250:13.53]I don't want him to use energy.
[250:15.37]Let me use the energy for him.
[250:21.52]Alright, a few more things to look at up here.
[250:23.08]Let me prospect.
[250:35.22]Never mind.
[250:38.19]Ooh, what's that?
[250:44.89]Something over here.
[250:45.57]I wish I could just throw him in the basket.
[250:53.43]I kind of do too.
[250:54.25]How am I going to get down here?
[251:03.41]I went up so far, all the way to the top.
[251:05.41]Why did I go on the mountain?
[251:07.80]I'm not even ready for this.
[251:14.97]I have to drop the dog to interact with things, oh god.
[251:23.95]You gonna be okay?
[251:37.30]You alright?
[251:38.72]How come you're not walking with me?
[251:43.08]With me, come on, let's go.
[251:53.93]Well, this is material.
[251:57.05]Is it copper?
[252:00.35]Copper.
[252:03.71]The dog passed out again.
[252:07.71]No.
[252:08.15]Why are you not staying with me?
[252:09.15]Alright.
[252:17.63]Get me a copper.
[252:22.34]We can sit here and eat.
[252:25.71]Oh yeah, that's right.
[252:26.65]It doesn't have the job anymore, right?
[252:30.64]Do a sign.
[252:31.44]Follow.
[252:38.18]Jobs.
[252:44.08]There we go.
[252:47.90]Answer the door.
[252:49.64]What door?
[252:51.52]Okay.
[253:05.40]I actually remember this part of the game.
[253:07.38]It scared the shit out of me when I first played it.
[253:13.98]This copper is shitty quality.
[253:16.50]The other one was too.
[253:17.30]I don't have enough food to mine here.
[253:22.29]Ah, fuck.
[253:26.71]The dog ate the last piece of bread.
[253:28.19]Or whatever the hell it was.
[253:30.07]I gotta get out of here, you're right.
[253:31.15]I gotta go.
[253:33.36]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[253:35.34]I guess I'll get one.
[253:36.24]Go.
[253:36.48]This has got to be the kind of town here.
[253:41.85]It has to be.
[253:42.41]Come on.
[253:51.54]Go, go, go, go.
[253:55.78]Alright, we're out.
[254:00.40]Uh...
[254:02.65]I need like a town or something.
[254:06.77]I'm in the middle of fucking nowhere.
[254:09.77]I'm in the middle of nowhere.
[254:19.50]The dog is so slow.
[254:20.68]Alright, pick up the dog again.
[254:24.00]I'm sorry.
[254:24.50]I gotta pick you up.
[254:27.86]I gotta run.
[254:28.70]Look at how much faster I am than you.
[254:30.12]Let's go.
[254:36.22]I'm not stopping for anything.
[254:37.34]I just gotta make it down the other side of the mountain.
[254:43.87]Is this early access?
[254:44.67]Nope.
[254:45.99]Game is out.
[254:47.27]It has released.
[254:51.29]This is a released video game.
[254:59.53]Where are we?
[255:01.90]Can I even get down from here?
[255:05.84]Yep, I can.
[255:06.42]Right here.
[255:10.10]Down, around, and then... Come on, is this a house over here?
[255:15.82]Something.
[255:16.32]A house.
[255:16.80]A hut.
[255:17.26]A village.
[255:19.06]A small group.
[255:27.38]When did it get released?
[255:28.54]10 years ago?
[255:31.99]I don't think so.
[255:37.34]Okay, dog's hungry again.
[255:38.68]Although, so am I. Let's go, pick up the pace.
[255:44.00]We didn't even scratch the surface of this area, too.
[255:59.82]It's been in development for ten years.
[256:03.68]Wow.
[256:10.53]That's a passion project for sure.
[256:12.21]Alright.
[256:17.51]There was a camp over here.
[256:22.51]Give me some points of interest.
[256:23.52]Oh, fuck.
[256:24.36]Who are you?
[256:26.68]Holy servants.
[256:27.38]Hey, wait, wait, wait.
[256:27.98]Maybe they'll help me.
[256:33.86]Do you guys have anything?
[256:34.64]Do you have any rations?
[256:37.08]I got a sick dog.
[256:40.91]Anybody here I can talk to?
[256:41.99]No, I'm going the wrong way.
[256:50.37]I gotta go this way.
[256:53.51]Past the river.
[257:00.04]We're okay.
[257:02.38]I'm not starving.
[257:03.58]I'm normal.
[257:10.36]supplies and stuff I can't stop for.
[257:11.94]I'm just gonna make it to the other side of the river and I'll be fine.
[257:24.01]No discoveries!
[257:27.76]The ha- look at- what- what could be right here?
[257:29.74]There has to be some- Wend, okay.
[257:30.94]The city of Wend.
[257:55.54]Did I lose the dog?
[257:58.47]All those bandits.
[258:05.95]Bounty.
[258:07.81]What?
[258:11.90]Knife.
[258:12.44]Skeletons.
[258:14.58]Harp.
[258:15.10]Skeletons.
[258:16.26]Uh...
[258:26.64]I'm just gonna keep going this way.
[258:30.78]Oh, the music is clashing.
[258:40.89]I'm in good spirits, and I do have a weapon.
[258:43.39]So I'm not... I'm not afraid.
[258:51.90]Something up here.
[258:52.48]We're just gonna go right into the crater.
[259:08.38]You want me to play Mongolian throat singing?
[259:12.90]No, we have Earthbound on right now.
[259:14.60]I love this OST.
[259:15.90]OST.
[259:19.30]What?
[259:19.52]I just say... I just say soundtrack.
[259:22.30]Is there a town?
[259:29.27]Camp?
[259:31.29]Discovered holy farm.
[259:34.51]What?
[259:36.13]No, I didn't.
[259:38.27]I'm in the crater!
[259:45.82]Fuck.
[259:46.14]Alright, Holy Farm.
[259:54.00]If I have to steal, I'm gonna steal.
[259:55.42]You know?
[259:57.66]Look, there's a couple of houses here.
[259:59.12]I'm gonna be friendly and introduce myself.
[260:10.41]Check the dog.
[260:11.27]Dog's alright.
[260:11.97]Just hungry.
[260:19.45]Okay, I'm about to pass the sludge river.
[260:31.84]Be friendly, introduce myself, and then steal everything.
[260:35.66]Well, what do you want me to do?
[260:37.52]We're kind of desperate right now.
[260:42.27]Are those... What are those, dogs?
[260:43.49]Oh, got food for days here, guys.
[260:47.61]Okay, let me take a look.
[261:11.31]This is easy.
[261:11.79]This is like a pig.
[261:15.33]Oh no, that's another dog.
[261:16.50]Can I trade my dog for this dog?
[261:18.64]This dog's healthy.
[261:24.72]Okay.
[261:28.21]Anybody here?
[261:28.81]What's this?
[261:30.13]Outhouse.
[261:31.81]Am I actually using it?
[261:42.48]Is this helping anything?
[261:49.02]Oh, a bed!
[261:49.42]Alright, I'm gonna put him in the bed.
[261:55.66]You just relax.
[261:57.34]Stay there.
[262:01.29]Stay.
[262:03.33]Stay there.
[262:04.55]Look good.
[262:05.13]Lie down.
[262:06.69]Relax.
[262:07.17]I'm gonna try to find us some food.
[262:17.06]Alright, I'm going to knock on the door.
[262:23.24]Storm house door open.
[262:25.67]I mean, do I have to knock?
[262:27.55]Is anybody even in here?
[262:32.29]There's nobody in here.
[263:07.50]Steel.
[263:08.46]Oh, man, look at the price.
[263:10.98]Look at the price on these.
[263:17.27]Look, it's the apocalypse.
[263:18.53]Oh, hey, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
[263:20.15]Out of bounds, out of bounds, out of bounds, out of bounds, out of bounds, out of bounds, out of bounds.
[263:23.21]Bye, bye, see you later.
[263:25.59]Out of bounds.
[263:26.47]My dog needed help.
[263:27.39]Alright, where's my dog?
[263:34.13]Did you have any food in there?
[263:39.77]If I get to a town, I can sell that shit and then make a lot of money.
[263:47.58]I'm gonna keep... Dog is gonna stay there.
[263:50.34]There's another house over here.
[263:52.10]I'm hoping to get some food.
[263:53.14]Okay, let's start walking.
[264:09.96]Sneak.
[264:13.40]Get this fucking door open.
[264:23.44]Texas smash the door?
[264:32.62]Kill if you must.
[264:33.98]Only if I have to.
[264:37.35]It's daytime.
[264:37.91]Someone's gonna come out of this door.
[264:42.07]Somebody's gonna open the door.
[264:43.53]Wait, can I stand over here?
[264:51.88]He watches my hair?
[264:52.96]No, somebody just said that!
[265:05.11]Does anybody live here?
[265:15.71]Come on.
[265:16.45]You can get this door.
[265:21.99]There's probably a fridge in here.
[265:23.05]There's probably snacks.
[265:25.48]There's probably food.
[265:26.34]There's probably water.
[265:28.74]I just have to get the... Okay.
[265:30.00]I can now just walk out.
[265:30.92]Now, I didn't open it.
[265:31.56]Somebody else did.
[265:32.58]Alright?
[265:33.30]If I reset the intelligence, it'll think that I did.
[265:35.54]You know what I mean?
[265:36.42]So now... Oh, I just came up here and the door was open.
[265:54.45]Person to sleep.
[265:55.07]I'm gonna steal everything from their body.
[265:58.37]First aid.
[265:59.59]Splint kit.
[266:15.50]But was it even worth coming in here?
[266:16.68]They don't even have any food in here.
[266:18.12]They got meat.
[266:19.04]They have raw meat.
[266:19.70]They got fish.
[266:20.32]Yeah, it was...
[266:30.89]fit somebody!
[266:33.97]What the fuck?
[266:35.83]Am I on his- Is this a move I'm doing?
[266:39.22]How did you pick me up?
[266:51.36]I thought- I thought I was doing that.
[266:54.73]No, what the fuck?
[266:57.01]No, I-
[267:06.12]I'm breaking it in now.
[267:08.22]You can call me a safe scummer all you want.
[267:10.73]It's nighttime.
[267:11.35]I'm getting in there and I'm taking the dried fish and the raw meat.
[267:18.29]I'm breaking this door open.
[267:19.81]They're sleeping.
[267:20.57]It's not gonna be daytime.
[267:21.81]I'll get it.
[267:29.71]Get it open.
[267:30.23]First try.
[267:30.93]First try.
[267:31.79]No, I didn't.
[267:32.17]Did I not get it?
[267:39.69]I just need to get in there, grab the dried fish, and get out.
[267:41.79]Okay, got it.
[267:44.07]Save the game.
[267:45.67]Save the game.
[267:51.34]Okay, get in.
[267:59.38]It's not even in the same place.
[268:01.78]Okay, get out, get out, get out.
[268:09.32]No, I ate it.
[268:10.18]I didn't want to eat it.
[268:16.06]What?
[268:27.45]Come on, dog.
[268:27.91]We gotta go.
[268:37.07]Where am I?
[268:38.37]Go over here.
[268:43.19]Get up!
[268:45.37]Pick up!
[268:45.71]Let's go!
[268:46.05]Let's go!
[268:46.27]Come on! Come on! Come on!
[268:58.27]I gotta do it. I need to.
[269:00.00]Hold on we're gonna get meat right here.
[269:12.84]Okay, here we go.
[269:14.16]I'm getting fucking meat.
[269:27.00]Come on!
[269:27.94]We need this meat!
[269:29.76]No!
[269:30.12]Come on, dog!
[269:31.68]I know you can do-
[269:49.97]That character's so useless.
[269:51.98]Where's the dog?
[269:52.92]Is my dog just a bloody pile on the ground?
[269:58.48]It's alright, I'll find another.
[269:59.84]Come here, dog!
[270:57.46]What's in here?
[271:00.14]What am I taking from them?
[271:04.34]What is this?
[271:04.76]A well?
[271:05.28]Oh, I'm feeling- I'm getting water.
[271:09.04]Water jug?
[271:10.59]Okay, got it.
[271:12.11]Raw meat.
[271:12.51]I can cook this.
[271:18.17]I don't know what the hell you're doing, but let's go.
[271:22.07]This door- This is open now.
[271:24.78]I need to fucking take- I need food.
[271:28.00]Fabrics.
[271:28.42]Hacksaw.
[271:29.42]Gears.
[271:29.90]Fuel.
[271:30.36]Alright.
[271:30.90]Jesus.
[271:31.38]Let's go.
[271:31.84]I got raw meat.
[271:33.51]That's enough.
[271:33.93]I'm gone.
[271:41.11]I'm already gone.
[271:45.83]I did steal a shitload of their bars, though.
[271:49.46]Alright.
[271:49.74]Now, let's go as Holy Farm.
[271:51.86]Let's keep going down this way.
[271:52.92]Let me go all the way through here.
[271:53.78]I need to set up a camp or something.
[271:58.25]Speaking of that.
[272:01.03]Camping.
[272:02.07]Campfire.
[272:04.05]Materials doesn't cost anything.
[272:06.05]No.
[272:06.27]It produces dry meat?
[272:07.77]It produces dried meat.
[272:08.54]Says who?
[272:08.76]What?
[272:08.98]No, it doesn't.
[272:29.10]It produces dried meat.
[272:32.92]From where?
[272:33.52]From the roots and the ground?
[272:34.88]Oh, no.
[272:39.12]I had the meat.
[272:39.73]Okay.
[272:40.97]Dog needs to eat this.
[272:48.73]Put you down.
[272:49.33]Dog.
[272:51.47]You need to eat that meat.
[272:53.71]I don't... Did he eat it?
[272:55.53]He did.
[272:55.93]Okay.
[272:56.69]Come back over here.
[272:57.19]I'll get you.
[273:00.01]Is there anything else I can do?
[273:01.09]Inventory.
[273:02.67]Um, no.
[273:05.11]I got raw iron leather.
[273:13.84]Copper.
[273:14.36]I got these.
[273:15.18]These are so expensive.
[273:17.70]You can auto-arrange.
[273:18.88]That's awesome.
[273:21.86]Okay, let's go.
[273:24.06]You ate.
[273:24.64]We're just gonna make it to where I wanted to go, which is down here.
[273:27.00]Let's go to this little section in this way.
[273:31.44]How am I gonna move this?
[273:39.05]He's gonna put the dog on the fire.
[273:40.45]I'm not gonna put the dog on the fire!
[273:43.11]He's gonna be just fine, we're gonna be best friends, and we're gonna have plenty of stories to tell.
[273:47.63]It's a big rock formation, isn't it?
[273:59.05]Apparently my disguise is blown.
[274:02.32]I wasn't aware I was wearing a disguise.
[274:05.52]Skinner's Roam.
[274:12.57]I discovered... Narco's Trap.
[274:16.99]Okay.
[274:36.27]I see a town.
[274:37.32]I see a town.
[274:40.61]Let's go for it.
[275:02.82]Talk about selling shit.
[275:05.24]This is... Uh, iron.
[275:08.84]It's got an iron quality 100.
[275:10.66]I can carry the dog and just get a few.
[275:12.92]I thought you guys said I couldn't interact with things with the dog in my hand.
[275:24.89]What the fuck was that?
[275:25.99]Did you see that?
[275:30.91]There was like an explosion over here.
[275:37.08]What was that?
[275:43.18]Am I sitting on the top of an active volcano?
[275:48.23]That was like an ironic voice.
[275:49.51]That wasn't me doing one.
[276:04.09]Stolen from Holy Sentinel.
[276:05.91]You had a lot of these bars.
[276:08.05]How's the dog doing?
[276:09.41]Okay, we're alright.
[276:10.07]We're gonna have money, though.
[276:11.55]We're gonna have money, and I'm gonna be able to do what I need to do.
[276:14.67]And I can get, like, the Jerm of Mustard emote off of Massamoon forever.
[276:18.88]And people are gonna come into the stream, and they're gonna think that I named the dog Massamoon.
[276:25.32]But I, like, didn't, though.
[276:26.16]You know what I mean?
[276:26.70]Like, that's an... Oh, yeah, my dog's name is Massamoon.
[276:29.76]No, no, it's because I'm supposed to be Sephiroth.
[276:31.64]I didn't, like, do this.
[276:47.89]You did, though.
[276:48.43]I did, but I didn't do that.
[276:51.27]The way that you're thinking, the way that you're describing that.
[277:03.18]Look at these stats.
[277:05.74]21 in athletics.
[277:07.76]My max run speed is crazy.
[277:09.28]30 in laboring.
[277:13.05]Crossbow smith, armor smith, science, robotics, field medic, stealth.
[277:20.60]Staying in dark and my special gear.
[277:25.03]Melee attack is one.
[277:29.75]Well, so this is why, because I keep, like, you, I was told a long time ago, I need to, I need to get hurt.
[277:36.15]Yeah, I gotta get knocked back down.
[277:37.20]You know what I mean?
[277:38.02]I have to get knocked down before I can do anything else.
[277:40.38]I have no sword skill, because I keep resetting when I take damage.
[277:50.30]Six hours in and no squad.
[277:53.38]Well, I do have a squad.
[277:57.20]Look, I'm just trying to survive.
[278:02.50]But, hold on, but wait, wait, wait, but hold on a second.
[278:04.54]Two to three hours of that was doing the hardest difficulty for a joke for like two hours.
[278:09.29]This was like a pretty fresh run from like two and a half hours ago.
[278:13.45]You know what I mean?
[278:25.13]Please don't give up on this game, I low-key love it.
[278:30.80]I'm having fun!
[278:32.66]This is a fun having fun.
[278:35.26]If I wasn't having fun, you'd know very quickly.
[278:45.95]Only a couple more.
[278:56.17]What does he mean by that?
[278:59.39]Well, he means that I probably would not be having fun.
[279:05.74]And I'd probably stop the stream or I'd be like, oh, you know, maybe I'll check that out.
[279:10.16]Maybe I'll check it out like another time. ...
[279:24.01]Not another kill all humans stream?
[279:28.84]What?
[279:29.08]Alright, that's good.
[279:31.12]Look at all the stuff that I have.
[279:32.10]I'm ready.
[279:33.48]Next town we get to.
[279:34.78]Iron Valleys.
[279:35.50]There's like a city right here.
[279:37.98]There's a hut.
[279:38.59]There's people here.
[279:39.29]There's probably, hopefully, some kind of person I can sell to.
[279:45.71]The rain, it's acid.
[279:47.09]Find cover.
[279:48.03]Damn, I'm getting my skin burnt.
[279:54.23]This rain is acid.
[279:57.77]Oh, wait, what?
[279:58.61]Alright, I gotta get inside of the gazebo.
[280:03.64]Come on, let's go.
[280:07.18]Hurry!
[280:07.86]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[280:10.36]The rain is burning my skin.
[280:17.59]I'm losing stats.
[280:18.71]Come on, hurry up.
[280:21.13]How do I even get in here?
[280:23.63]Stop them.
[280:25.39]Tainted woman.
[280:26.03]Wait, what's going on?
[280:28.43]New party member?
[280:33.74]Defensive gate.
[280:34.42]The holy nation.
[280:35.18]Alright, hold on.
[280:35.64]Wait, wait, wait.
[280:36.06]What happened?
[280:37.60]Free stuff.
[280:43.54]Holy shit.
[280:44.02]Free shit.
[280:46.35]Is this stealing?
[280:48.25]No, he didn't have anything.
[280:49.97]What's going on?
[280:52.41]Alright, come on.
[280:52.89]Somebody has to have something.
[280:55.19]I don't... I don't see a shop.
[280:57.15]I need a shop.
[280:57.71]These are all... Thank God for the Holy Nation.
[281:05.52]Is this a store?
[281:13.34]You're not allowed here.
[281:14.08]Leave.
[281:14.44]Ugh.
[281:18.93]It's not... Can I talk to somebody?
[281:23.21]Nobody has a dialog tree?
[281:31.27]Fuck the Holy Nation!
[281:33.21]Come on!
[281:33.86]I'm the person in need!
[281:34.94]How dare you!
[281:39.90]Come on!
[281:50.86]My skin is still burning!
[281:57.10]I need shelter.
[281:59.32]There has to be somebody I can talk to in here.
[282:04.76]Whether in the town, behind, somewhere, up top.
[282:07.19]Nobody?
[282:07.61]Nothing?
[282:09.11]A mounted turret.
[282:15.49]Can I speak to you?
[282:17.25]Stool.
[282:17.75]Use the stool.
[282:19.27]Out of bounds.
[282:19.86]Leave.
[282:23.17]Fine.
[282:23.79]Cast me out.
[282:24.61]I'll go walk in the acid rain.
[282:26.07]Thanks, guys.
[282:26.61]Thanks for nothing.
[282:30.57]Yeah, I'll take me and my dying dog, and I'll go walk back out in the acid rain.
[282:38.26]Unbelievable.
[282:46.24]Really?
[282:47.73]You gotta be kidding me.
[282:48.91]Are you serious?
[282:50.67]Are you serious?! !
[282:54.17]No, why?
[282:55.67]I was already gone.
[282:57.55]No, don't kill the dog.
[283:00.95]Run, Master Moon!
[283:11.22]Where are they even taking me?
[283:12.62]Up in the...
[283:23.04]Wait a minute, who's this?
[283:27.79]Where's the dog?
[283:28.31]Oh!
[283:54.84]This is... 1835... right there.
[283:57.76]Okay, remember, I can't- no one's gonna help me in here.
[284:07.47]I have to just leave.
[284:12.36]And on my way out, they're all gonna come after me.
[284:14.24]There's a hut over here.
[284:18.76]Might be some supplies.
[284:29.87]Anything?
[284:31.51]No, just shitty houses.
[284:32.85]Alright, well, I gotta get out of the acid rain, and I don't know if I can... Let's go over here.
[284:44.02]I have lots of fucking stuff.
[284:48.46]I have supplies, I have money.
[284:52.79]Put on Animal Crossing?
[284:54.01]Yeah, we've had enough time on the, uh...
[284:57.47]Bloody Acid Rain.
[284:58.27]We've had enough time on Earth Bomb.
[285:05.58]Animal Crossing OST.
[285:17.13]Relaxing Animal Crossing music compilation.
[285:26.18]This is pretty relaxing.
[285:27.02]Okay.
[285:27.68]Let's go.
[285:30.42]I'm going to say down this way.
[285:40.98]Oh, that's cool.
[285:43.62]Yeah, you can go here.
[285:44.58]That's kind of cool.
[285:47.64]There's like 400,000 planets in the game.
[285:49.15]This is just one of them.
[285:49.81]They all have their own unique, completely designed from the ground up landscapes.
[285:53.85]No, I'm kidding.
[285:54.25]That's a lie.
[285:56.59]What's that?
[285:57.09]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[285:57.91]Hold on.
[285:58.13]There's a giant bug.
[285:59.99]There's like a bug monster that way.
[286:05.59]I gotta cut across that way.
[286:07.62]Should I fight the bug?
[286:08.38]Do you think we can take the bug?
[286:10.64]What level's the bug?
[286:13.12]Old machine, iron spider, athletic 40.
[286:17.20]No.
[286:17.98]No, no, no.
[286:18.90]Age, attack 36, strength 36, dexterity 39.
[286:21.86]No way.
[286:25.94]Look at me.
[286:26.28]Look at how much of a piece of shit I am.
[286:28.98]Minus 4, minus 4, 21.
[286:31.98]I'll die in two hits.
[286:40.66]Looks like the aggro range.
[286:41.76]I don't know.
[286:43.32]Hopefully not that far.
[286:45.58]No, hopefully very far.
[286:47.62]Hopefully not that far.
[286:49.42]What?
[286:51.22]Not that far.
[286:52.64]What accent am I falling into here?
[287:00.13]What's wrong with the dog?
[287:01.09]The dog is... The dog got... I don't have enough food.
[287:06.89]That's what happened to the dog.
[287:17.86]Oh yeah, where's the squad?
[287:21.12]Jeremy, where's your squad members?
[287:23.00]You can have 20 people in a party in this game.
[287:25.22]This is so expansive and so cool.
[287:28.14]Oh, what's that?
[287:28.84]Oh, so I've just got, what's that?
[287:30.49]You've been carrying your only squad member on your shoulder for about hour and 40 minutes.
[287:43.49]Nice work.
[287:47.34]Oh, fuck.
[287:54.68]What am I doing over here?
[287:55.70]Oh.
[287:58.87]I gotta get out of here.
[288:00.01]That's the only way I can go is down with no... I discovered the Oakenshield!
[288:23.64]Acid brain.
[288:24.28]The dog's unconscious, but it don't matter.
[288:29.30]Alright, it's gonna sound bad, and you guys are gonna be not happy about this, but... I think I'm gonna, like, give the dog away.
[288:36.50]Because what kind of life is this?
[288:38.69]You know what I mean?
[288:42.49]Somebody else will feed and take care of this dog.
[288:44.53]I'm like an adventurer.
[288:45.61]The dog can't handle this right now.
[288:46.99]You know, I'm sure there's some family that would love to have this dog.
[289:06.89]Sorry, somebody has an important message.
[289:09.74]Uh... Oh, no, no, no, no.
[289:12.24]Hold on.
[289:14.58]This way, this way, this way, this way, this way, this way.
[289:16.50]Don't see me.
[289:20.45]Why am I going through the area where the super mutants are?
[289:27.73]Jeez, okay.
[289:30.09]Uh, so Demonic Cucumber said, Uh, Jeremy, an episode of Family Guy, uh, that Family Guy show came on yesterday.
[289:38.96]And I was pretty surprised to see that they stole some of your jokes.
[289:41.74]Really.
[289:42.92]How?
[289:44.02]The guy living next door came over and said, Hey, Beater, one of your classic jokes.
[289:49.04]Just to make it worse, they also stole the poop and shitting your pants jokes you always make.
[289:53.17]It's terrible to see such a big company stealing from small creators.
[289:56.23]Uh...
[290:07.93]Oh, there's a guy and his neighbor comes over.
[290:11.66]Bandits.
[290:15.00]Bounty?
[290:18.56]Hold on, that guy has a bounty?
[290:21.96]No, I do.
[290:26.61]Wait, the Holy Nation wanted for theft.
[290:29.63]Those characters wanted by the authorities turned them in for a reward.
[290:32.59]These characters not wanted by the local faction.
[290:37.12]I have a 2500 cent bounty on me right now.
[290:44.52]And why is that, exactly?
[290:51.60]Turn yourself in and collect the bounty.
[290:59.30]You stole a bunch of shit and ran.
[291:01.81]Yeah, but they didn't know who I was.
[291:04.49]I never said, it's me, canned Roth.
[291:06.45]I'm here to steal all of your bread.
[291:08.31]I'm a nobody.
[291:14.33]What's that?
[291:17.45]Iron.
[291:18.49]That's terrible iron.
[291:22.81]Alright, we got settlement over here.
[291:35.15]You're the only dwarf on the planet.
[291:37.97]That's not even true.
[291:42.68]How's the dog doing?
[291:43.58]Bad.
[291:44.56]What happened?
[291:45.38]Blessings?
[291:49.04]What?
[291:51.75]This is the Holy Nation.
[291:53.23]I'm wanted by the Holy Nation.
[291:54.59]I can't even go over here.
[291:55.43]This is like a new outpost.
[291:56.99]I can't do this.
[292:04.97]Is this, like, a kill on sight with me?
[292:11.71]Why does the Holy Nation take over the whole game?
[292:13.46]What's this guy got?
[292:24.73]Athletic 40... Attack D... Why is everyone so much better than me?
[292:29.75]I really am just a loser.
[292:32.13]Carrying around my father's sword.
[292:36.87]You know, I'm not, I'm not my father.
[292:38.36]I have negative four attack.
[292:56.96]Don't mind me.
[292:58.72]Just the guy with the $2500 bounty trying to walk through to a different city.
[293:06.05]But look at how much stuff is in here.
[293:07.59]Are we sure they're even gonna give a shit though?
[293:16.31]No one said anything so far.
[293:31.95]I just closed the gate.
[293:35.47]I just locked them all out.
[293:40.04]Sorry.
[293:40.80]I'm sorry.
[293:41.40]I didn't mean to do that.
[293:42.36]I... The game's camera went up really high.
[293:45.84]Alright, give me a shop.
[293:46.74]What have we got?
[293:53.30]Is that a store?
[293:55.29]First aid.
[293:56.25]Let's go.
[293:56.65]I got steel bars.
[294:00.31]I got money.
[294:02.68]Does nobody recognize me?
[294:06.26]And we'll be all good.
[294:07.94]I'm getting a lot of looks though.
[294:09.14]Okay, hold on.
[294:18.36]Talk to.
[294:20.40]Do you have any medical supplies for sale?
[294:21.80]Can you change my appearance?
[294:25.12]Um, basic first aid kits.
[294:26.73]I need food.
[294:31.75]Fencing chance 20%.
[294:33.19]It's alright, I'll sell these.
[294:38.21]I got these fair and square.
[294:42.86]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[294:43.72]Hold on.
[294:46.86]Why do I have a 22%- Did I take this from somebody?
[295:01.70]Yeah, what did I steal it from?
[295:02.95]The ore?
[295:03.47]Okay, well, I got... I have plenty of first aid.
[295:08.25]How much I can do?
[295:12.39]Um... I need to talk to some people.
[295:16.34]I need to get... I need to make some fucking friends.
[295:20.22]What are they doing?
[295:29.08]I need friends and I need food.
[295:36.73]I have money.
[295:37.31]I need friends.
[295:41.57]I have money.
[295:42.53]That's kind of a desperate thing to announce.
[295:47.44]Is somebody fighting?
[295:53.32]What's the fight going on in here?
[295:58.15]You saw that, right?
[295:59.97]What was that for?
[296:12.96]Oh no, did... Supplies, those are free.
[296:23.67]Come on man, you do it again.
[296:25.71]This is so pathetic.
[296:44.30]I need to fight, like, a shitty character.
[296:46.80]Oh, boy.
[296:49.82]What do you got here?
[296:51.83]Iron plates?
[296:57.87]Electrical... Okay, there's a Raspberry Pi.

[297:20.73]Alright, I'm running out of space.
[297:21.93]I need to... I could just sell these right now.
[297:26.89]Well, the dog... The dog I might seriously just... Auto-arrange it?
[297:39.67]Not bad.
[297:40.25]Not bad!
[297:44.62]Say it.
[297:45.18]No, I can't say it because it's terrible.
[297:52.52]This is bad.
[297:53.10]I'm gonna have to eat the dog.
[298:01.99]I'm kidding, I'm not gonna eat- I'm not gonna eat the dog.
[298:04.85]I need to rest- save my dog companion.
[298:09.41]Let's keep going this way.
[298:12.07]Nobody has any food, I need a bar, I need friends, I need... Anything.
[298:17.81]What's that big cube?
[298:28.44]Let's go!
[298:35.16]Can I get a mount?
[298:41.64]Wah!
[298:42.72]Where did it come from?
[298:43.64]Oh my goodness!
[298:47.15]Just go, go, go, go, go!
[298:48.13]Run quick!
[298:54.79]Turn it!
[298:57.97]Oh!
[299:21.88]I needed to have that happen.
[299:23.80]I had to get beat up.
[299:26.42]I'm not going to reset it.
[299:28.90]Because look.
[299:31.60]Toughness 2.
[299:32.66]See, I have to get my ass kicked.
[299:34.30]I have to lose.
[299:35.10]So that I can know what it's like to lose.
[299:39.90]Alright, I'll wake up in a second.
[299:42.02]They're gone.
[299:50.28]I'm not dead yet.
[299:52.90]Almost.
[299:59.90]Recovery coma.
[300:01.10]God damn it.
[300:03.16]No!
[300:08.40]I tried.
[300:09.30]I tried to save you.
[300:12.98]What was I supposed to do?
[300:14.96]I tried to feed you.
[300:15.90]I tried to take care of you.
[300:17.10]Getting jumped by bandits and fucking bugs and snakes.
[300:35.81]This is gonna get to minus 100.
[300:37.34]He's dead.
[300:39.52]The dog's dead.
[300:43.16]The dog's dead!
[300:49.54]No, I tried.
[300:50.52]I tried to... No, I'm gonna go back.
[300:52.90]That's not okay.
[300:55.17]Where is this?
[300:55.81]No, I can't.
[300:59.13]I don't want to eat the dog.
[301:02.11]Ugh.
[301:04.96]Why am I dying?
[301:07.89]Wait, I'm about to die.
[301:19.61]I shouldn't be dying right now.
[301:20.97]I can't do anything, I'm dead.
[301:25.52]No, I'm already dead, it's over.
[301:29.34]This is not gonna heal back up.
[301:32.32]Somebody has to come save me.
[301:43.72]Check the other buildings instead of being a sand runner.
[301:49.04]Alright, I got, this is 10 minutes ago.
[301:55.18]Alright, this is right when I was outside.
[302:02.69]Let's go.
[302:07.33]What's wrong with the camera here?
[302:12.89]What's going on?
[302:16.54]alright so we've got one two three four I'm gonna go we'll start over here no plates anymore it's okay I need a fucking friend I'm desperate for a friend somebody that can carry me I need to talk to somebody in here and pay them 4 200 gold
[302:48.60]Medical supplies.
[302:49.46]Yeah, sell all this shit.
[302:57.33]Yes.
[302:58.69]Yes, these are stolen.
[302:59.75]That's fine.
[303:01.27]Now give me... I got... I'll take one more basic first aid kit.
[303:08.01]And then splint kit maybe.
[303:09.65]I might need one.
[303:11.05]How expensive are these?
[303:13.85]They're expensive, but...
[303:17.60]I need one.
[303:18.12]I have to have one.
[303:18.84]Okay.
[303:27.32]Alright.
[303:29.35]Now I'm gonna go to the other side.
[303:33.61]Don't be a sand runner.
[303:39.27]I'm just running across Tatooine with fucking mini Chewbacca in my hands.
[303:47.87]So there's this one.
[303:48.77]There's also... Are there any other buildings?
[303:50.99]This one's run down.
[303:51.67]That one's destroyed.
[303:52.43]So we have... Yeah, a few places here.
[303:57.15]I don't think this is a bar.
[304:09.42]Off limits.
[304:10.00]I can't even leave.
[304:10.86]I can't even go in here.
[304:12.48]And now I'm going to get chased out.
[304:13.54]And people are going to know my bounty is up.
[304:18.11]See?
[304:18.41]And now everybody's fucking running after me.
[304:20.71]This is a mistake.
[304:24.62]I can't go in the other buildings.
[304:27.24]See?
[304:27.42]He doesn't get it that I left already.
[304:33.42]I gotta be a sand runner.
[304:34.68]I have to.
[304:38.65]There's one other spot over here.
[304:52.52]Once I find a friend, you'll know.
[304:59.92]Check the buildings?
[305:01.08]I know, I know, I know.
[305:02.92]But if I go in a building, people freak out.
[305:07.20]This guy's gonna freak out.
[305:10.76]Why did he not freak out?
[305:11.56]One of these fax machines?
[305:15.60]Small generator.
[305:32.20]Nothing?
[305:35.16]Battery bank, battery bank, loot.
[305:38.23]Nothing.
[305:40.37]Nothing in these.
[305:40.93]No.
[305:44.11]Why is that?
[305:44.81]What was the point of that?
[305:51.15]Nice foreshadowing?
[305:52.57]What do you mean?
[305:55.44]This is like a barracks.
[305:56.18]It's definitely off limits.
[306:07.29]Can I go in here?
[306:07.89]Find out.
[306:12.70]Nope.
[306:16.62]I have to do bad stuff?
[306:22.44]No, I gotta be a sand runner.
[306:23.72]I have to.
[306:26.70]I could go back to that big town.
[306:28.10]I mean, World's End was a huge town.
[306:32.20]A lot of stuff there.
[306:33.05]But that's a long run.
[306:34.39]That's a long way.
[306:35.07]You can tell what buildings you can go into by clicking on them.
[306:42.67]Open to public.
[306:43.45]Private.
[306:44.45]Okay.
[306:47.89]Be smited.
[306:48.64]Free stuff.
[307:04.15]Is that guy swimming?
[307:07.79]Holy fuck, look at the weapon.
[307:12.51]What is this?
[307:14.09]1772?
[307:14.11]1770.
[307:14.59]Ooh!
[307:16.58]Blood loss.
[307:23.62]Fragment axe.
[307:27.44]Okay.
[307:27.66]Do you have any money?
[307:30.59]Do you have any food?
[307:32.15]Didn't have any food.
[307:44.37]Somebody dead up there has to have food.
[307:46.91]Look at all these dead bodies.
[307:49.97]This guy is single-handedly killing everybody in here.
[307:54.47]Is this like a boss?
[307:57.97]Oh, kill them all.
[307:59.23]Kill them all.
[308:01.92]Kill all of them.
[308:03.46]And then give- I'm gonna have a fucking field day.
[308:15.40]You know how much stuff I'm gonna get from this?
[308:16.80]He's gonna kill everybody here.
[308:26.95]How to do a bounty.
[308:30.97]This person has a bounty on their head.
[308:32.39]You can check somebody who has a bounty on the status panel.
[308:35.77]Really?
[308:37.05]To collect bounties, you need to take them to a police station.
[308:38.91]First knock the personnel, then pick them up and carry them to the police station.
[308:42.05]Pick up a bounty, hold right click mouse to bring up the interaction menu.
[308:44.63]Once you've found the police station, talk to the station's police chief.
[308:46.67]This guy's got a bounty on his head.
[308:52.91]Status.
[308:53.95]Where is it?
[308:54.53]Where does it say that?
[308:55.13]Alright, I'm gonna go fucking hit him.
[309:02.74]If I get the last hit, that means I win, right?
[309:25.68]Get him!
[309:27.44]Did he break my arm?
[309:29.70]He just fucking broke- No!
[309:38.19]I can't!
[309:39.31]Attack him!
[309:40.59]You can do it!
[309:51.83]Oh my, wait, wait, wait, I can't go after him.
[309:55.15]Hold on, wait.
[309:57.27]No, I need to get the stuff on him.
[309:59.10]That was my bounty!
[310:06.44]God damn it.
[310:07.36]Missed your chance to loot.
[310:16.82]What the fuck?
[310:19.78]No, this guy's probably gonna bounty too.
[310:22.42]Hold on.
[310:37.95]I need to fucking heal myself.
[310:39.61]For the love of God.
[310:40.49]I need to use the splint.
[310:45.06]First aid.
[310:45.98]Heal your arm.
[310:47.88]Splint your arm.
[310:51.14]How do I use the splint?
[310:52.20]I just bought it!
[310:53.30]I can't s- I can't even splint this arm.
[310:57.94]There's no splinting this arm.
[311:00.82]What's fr-
[311:23.47]You have the same problem.
[311:25.29]We both go to the same doctor.
[311:31.89]I'm missing the loot.
[311:32.75]I can't pick this shit up.
[311:34.09]No, don't touch it!
[311:46.03]How do I fix this though, for real?
[311:48.11]I'm not gonna be able to carry the dog.
[311:52.23]I can't carry this dog with a fucked up arm.
[311:56.19]It's in the process of being healed.
[312:00.39]Okay.
[312:01.33]God damn it.
[312:22.53]Alright, it's time.
[312:23.69]I can't even pick you up, man.
[312:26.64]How long is it gonna take?
[312:27.46]Click the medic button on the bottom right.
[312:31.96]Medic.
[312:54.36]Just save scummit.
[313:26.72]Let's go.
[313:27.32]I have money.
[313:33.40]All I'm doing is deleting my progress from my save scum.
[313:36.95]I know.
[313:37.63]It's stupid and I need to stop doing it.
[313:40.69]I need to, like, go find a little shitty guy to kill.
[313:45.35]Let's just... There's probably something over here.
[313:46.96]I gotta go run through the sand.
[313:53.02]Here comes, like, a scorpion.
[313:56.69]I don't know how long my arm was gonna take.
[313:58.46]I couldn't carry the dog.
[313:59.66]I would have to go sleep.
[314:05.32]Go back, go back, go back.
[314:06.34]What do you mean, wait, wait?
[314:12.49]Get away from me!
[314:13.87]Wait, I'll hit him.
[314:14.47]I can hit him.
[314:15.87]I can level up.
[314:19.43]Oh fuck, there's a skeleton.
[314:26.35]Got it.
[314:26.61]Come on.
[314:26.95]I need to... Get out.
[314:37.53]No, you're too hungry for this.
[314:44.53]I'm not going to rewind.
[314:45.69]I needed to get hurt.
[314:49.97]Dog could probably use some training here.
[315:01.28]Alright, get up.
[315:04.15]Get recovery, Komo.
[315:05.57]Great.
[315:06.79]I'm dead.
[315:18.18]I'm dead.
[315:20.54]I'm dead.
[315:24.75]This guy's dead.
[315:26.03]He's not getting up.
[315:27.27]It's minus 43.
[315:28.50]I'm not gonna recovery hook.
[315:30.72]Dog does more damage than I do.
[315:48.46]Dog, no.
[315:52.93]Oh, God.
[316:14.08]What the hell is that?
[316:17.86]Why is this guy doing push-ups?
[316:20.83]Oh no, get out of here!
[316:26.91]Dog, run!
[316:29.52]What did he just pick up?
[316:30.40]He's eating?
[316:31.42]He's eating someone!
[316:43.72]He's eating this guy's leg.
[316:47.12]Whose body part is that?
[316:50.88]Where are you going?
[316:52.42]Stay back here.
[316:53.32]Stay back here.
[316:54.32]Back here.
[316:54.82]Come on, you can eat that here.
[316:57.57]Just wait till I get up for my recovery coma.
[317:09.95]Okay, rescue.
[317:12.29]Where are you- I don't know where he's going.
[317:13.51]He doesn't want to listen to me.
[317:15.31]He- I can't- I didn't- I want to see how this plays out.
[317:22.12]Where the hell is he going?
[317:57.14]They're both gonna die.
[317:58.18]Oh, this is fucking hilarious.
[318:03.29]Well, okay.
[318:14.73]I can't start a new game.
[318:16.05]I already have so much non-progress on this one.
[318:20.52]I'm addicted to this game, though.
[318:21.84]I have to keep going.
[318:27.54]So, I need a spot.
[318:31.23]I know everyone told me to go down here.
[318:33.57]But I don't- I- I'll find it eventually.
[318:36.37]I need to go to a bar.
[318:50.43]This story's over.
[318:55.64]But I have to- Okay.
[319:00.62]Sunk cost fallacy.
[319:05.54]No, I can make it.
[319:06.84]I can make it.
[319:07.45]I'm just gonna go.
[319:11.25]I'm not gonna run through the desert again.
[319:19.17]I wanna look.
[319:22.61]Not that way.
[319:24.33]I need to go...
[319:27.85]I'm going back... What just... I'm sorry.
[319:30.61]I gotta go this way.
[319:33.25]We gotta trek back where we came from.
[319:38.00]New game.
[319:38.42]No, I can't do a new game.
[319:39.74]Not yet.
[319:40.02]I'm too invested.
[319:40.82]Not yet.
[319:46.84]I need to go back here, and then I'm gonna go down here.
[319:49.47]You understand?
[319:51.27]But I'm not gonna run through the desert.
[319:59.59]I'll be able to make it through here, back to the farm, and then I'm going down here.
[320:05.79]This is, I'm gonna, this little green pasture here.
[320:19.52]Now, we're gonna see the conclusion of this.
[320:23.12]I don't know if those are good guys or bad guys.
[320:24.44]Okay, they're good.
[320:29.59]Now just have faith.
[320:31.53]Just have faith.
[320:32.91]I'll get us through this.
[320:37.07]Let's go.
[320:38.33]Dog is okay, starving, but it's alright.
[320:40.21]I got plenty of supplies.
[320:41.31]We're gonna get up there.
[320:42.01]We're gonna go.
[320:48.00]Down at the green pasture, there'll be a stable or something down there.
[320:51.38]I'll make it.
[320:51.92]I'm gonna take a left up here.
[320:54.48]Past here, through the holy farm.
[321:02.03]Song name, Relaxing Animal Crossing Music Compilation.
[321:08.52]See?
[321:08.72]Right up there.
[321:13.74]Didn't take very long.
[321:14.46]See?
[321:14.68]We're fine.
[321:27.72]Oh.
[321:29.83]Why is it so much fun to be just terrible?
[321:34.78]Because I know eventually, if I have some faith, that I will grow my character up.
[321:41.54]So let's go down here.
[321:43.42]Down the river.
[321:57.28]We'll discover some new land.
[321:58.65]There'll be a little town.
[322:00.19]And I will be able to just discover holy mines.
[322:05.45]Take a look at that.
[322:06.19]Alright.
[322:06.77]Blister Hill.
[322:08.81]You got it.
[322:10.25]Town.
[322:10.85]New town.
[322:11.27]Uh-oh.
[322:18.42]Okay, thank you.

[327:07.26]He didn't eat it?
[327:07.94]Yeah, he did.
[327:08.44]Look.

[327:56.50]And you think that I'm your wanderer.
[327:57.54]Yep.
[327:57.66]How about a discount?
[327:58.92]The wealthy do not need discounts.
[328:01.38]That's way out of my budget.
[328:02.06]What about the guy across the table?
[328:28.24]The lights in this bloody bar are starting to make my head spin.
[328:30.42]Work here is dried up big time.

[329:20.30]I need to find a fence.
[329:24.52]Yeah, but this is not in here.
[329:29.07]3000 is doable.
[329:31.19]I mean, maybe if I take- I steal it.
[329:35.25]Sell the steal?
[329:36.25]I can't.
[329:36.89]There's only... There's a 20% chance for me to succeed.
[329:47.70]This guy's 3000.
[329:48.68]I could get it.
[329:54.58]Just save scum until it works.
[329:58.91]Oh my god.
[330:08.98]That guy had 100%?
[330:10.06]No, he didn't.
[330:17.40]22.
[330:17.42]You got caught selling stolen items.
[330:23.79]Hey, that's mine!
[330:27.41]Oh, is it now?
[330:31.60]This guy's kicking and punching.
[330:41.50]This dude... Paladin Steve!
[330:45.56]Nice 3D movie maker kick.
[330:50.96]I think I would- I want to fight this guy one-on-one.
[330:52.80]I feel like I could level up on this dude.
[331:04.78]I have negative three attack.
[331:06.12]Yeah, I know.
[331:09.06]It's bad.
[331:15.16]I need to, like, punch rats in the starter zone, but there is no starter zone.
[331:19.22]It doesn't exist.
[331:24.91]Heal the dog?
[331:25.65]There's only so much I can do.
[331:27.85]He just has to eat.
[331:30.13]I just have to keep feeding the dog.
[331:34.92]I mean, the dog is doing just fine besides this.
[331:40.30]Find a training dummy.
[331:45.72]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[331:46.67]Who's that?
[331:47.01]Oh, it's another mercenary.
[331:50.99]No.
[331:53.39]Find a training dummy in a police station.
[332:03.54]Uh, well...
[332:07.97]Let's see if I can talk to anybody.
[332:15.83]Am I allowed in here?
[332:16.49]I didn't even check.
[332:18.84]Got some people, though.
[332:20.86]One guy.
[332:24.04]Green fruit, cup, flower, raw stone.
[332:34.85]Get out.
[332:36.13]Ugh.
[332:55.73]Told you it wouldn't work.
[333:01.42]I'm the weird guy in town nobody likes.
[333:05.54]And you're telling me there was the fence?
[333:09.81]Alright, new music.
[333:15.95]What's the new soundtrack I'm gonna put up?
[333:26.41]Stardew Valley.
[333:30.88]Age of Empires?
[333:39.46]Age of Empires.
[333:41.20]OST.
[333:41.58]This is a short one.
[333:54.95]Alright.
[333:55.37]Fence.
[333:58.59]Your mercenaries.
[333:59.39]The dog has eaten at this point.
[334:09.27]Check upstairs.
[334:10.13]I will try.
[334:12.51]No, no, no.
[334:22.69]Nobody up here, but there's... Nobody can see me.
[334:33.88]Come on, get it.
[334:37.87]Open the lock.
[334:48.07]How many times?
[334:49.07]Come on.
[334:49.76]Okay, I gotta... Oh, fucking holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.
[334:55.16]Open it.
[334:55.70]Holy shit.
[334:56.64]Holy shit, I'm panicking.
[334:57.68]Take it.
[334:58.22]Take it all.
[334:59.56]Who caught me?
[335:02.81]Who caught me taking that?
[335:04.49]What?
[335:14.00]I didn't sneak?
[335:22.42]But... So, me crouching and opening up a thing and picking a piece of fish out is different than me standing up.
[335:40.89]Me, me crouching.
[335:43.19]Let's try that again.
[335:47.45]How much?
[335:48.43]3,000.
[335:49.13]Can't afford that.
[335:54.89]Me crouch.
[335:59.28]They still have shackles on?
[336:00.34]Is that the problem?
[336:00.94]Alright, I'll get it this time.
[336:06.38]So, you're telling me sneak?
[336:09.44]Like this?
[336:13.76]Then open it.
[336:14.26]I can get a horse.
[336:36.07]Okay.
[336:37.13]Nobody heard this.
[336:45.36]What was that?
[336:49.08]Just... I was just curious.
[336:51.36]If, um... What happened there?
[336:56.17]Someone's on the balcony.
[336:58.73]Who the fuck is on the balcony?
[337:04.29]Is there nobody on the balcony?
[337:10.59]It's a 56% chance to steal.
[337:21.58]I need the stuff in here.
[337:28.76]Are you okay?
[337:29.82]Never been better.
[337:36.33]I'm gonna open it and then let me take a look and see how hard things are to take.
[337:48.10]I'm so desperate for food.
[337:50.10]I have to try to get these.
[337:53.66]Okay.
[337:58.22]Save game.
[338:00.22]This ain't gonna work.
[338:02.04]That's fine.
[338:04.78]Okay.
[338:05.72]So now... Stealing chance.
[338:09.56]All 56%.
[338:10.18]So what's the most... What's the best thing to take here?
[338:13.88]Probably the meat wrap.
[338:17.02]I didn't get it.
[338:20.23]That's three times in a row.
[338:24.13]I just flipped a coin three times.
[338:25.55]And got heads three times.
[338:32.08]F5 is quicksave and F9, yeah, stupid.
[338:39.04]Whatever has the highest nutrition.
[338:42.27]That's a good idea.
[338:46.21]Nutrition, 50, 50, 25, 20, 30, it's 50, it's a meat wrap.
[338:53.69]Really, like, that's four heads in a row.
[339:03.62]I have to feed this to the dog.
[339:12.77]F5, F9.
[339:16.91]Just get rid of the dog!
[339:20.29]Would you say that?
[339:21.68]Would you say that if it was your dog?
[339:24.28]Would you say that if it was your dog?
[339:30.12]Got it.
[339:49.43]That's OK.
[339:49.80]It's alright.
[339:53.30]What's this throwing my body into the ground?
[340:45.68]Yes!
[340:46.28]Alright, now I can get the fish too.
[340:51.54]I mean, why not just get it all, you know?
[340:53.52]Why not just get it all?
[341:11.42]This is the way to truly play the game.
[341:14.00]Well, hold on now.
[341:14.64]Let me see if anything's worth taking in here.
[341:16.78]Let me wait till the game to load.
[341:18.00]I'm gonna break the engine.
[341:24.43]Holy shit, when did you come up here?
[341:27.29]I got my hand on the handle.
[341:30.24]My hand is in the cookie jar right now.
[341:32.02]And my face is covered with chocolate and crumbs.
[341:40.39]Don't move.
[341:41.05]I'm not gonna move.
[341:57.76]That's freaking me out.
[341:59.14]That was horror movie-like.
[342:00.73]Head tilting.
[342:12.60]Okay, I'm good.
[342:35.74]It's the perfect crime.
[342:37.28]The perfect, perfect plan.
[342:41.80]There goes 100 gold.
[342:42.76]I need to... I just blew 17% of my money.
[342:56.87]No, I'm gonna pull it back and then I'm gonna just hide.
[343:02.84]Look, he's not even gonna be on the same AI path.
[343:12.11]Okay.
[343:12.77]Nobody coming?
[343:14.15]Let's try the other one.
[343:14.87]90% chance.
[343:18.59]That's what I'd like to see.
[343:19.36]Alright, what's in here?
[343:26.12]10,000.
[343:26.18]Wanted the Red Bandit.
[343:27.38]But is this... There wasn't even a percentage on there.
[343:31.63]There was no percentage chance to take that.
[343:33.51]Where was it?
[343:48.77]It was just a poster.
[343:49.77]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[343:53.03]I'm out.
[343:53.29]Let me try this one more time.
[343:54.72]One more piece.
[343:56.26]I'm trying to get one fish.
[343:59.66]Got it.
[344:00.14]Two fishes.
[344:20.01]Alright, I'm good.
[344:22.62]We got good food down.
[344:24.78]This food's gonna... Very nutritious.
[344:26.62]Gonna fill us all up.
[344:28.28]Plenty of food.
[344:31.12]I can leave.
[344:31.82]I got... How much... What do I got?
[344:33.03]Alright, let's get this shit in the other bag.
[344:39.45]Very filling food.
[344:41.35]Lots of it.
[344:43.19]And I gotta find a fence.
[344:44.38]I can sell these bars.
[344:46.30]And, you know, the rest.
[344:50.58]Dog, I'm coming.
[344:51.72]I'm coming with really good food.
[344:53.24]What's this thing?
[344:55.14]Splint kit.
[344:55.66]Get it.
[344:58.95]Small emperor statue.
[345:01.01]Alright, give me the splint kit.
[345:03.77]These things are dried fish, too.
[345:05.05]Look at this.
[345:05.35]I got another fish.
[345:06.89]Perfect.
[345:08.97]Dried fish.
[345:11.32]Small emperor statue.
[345:12.38]Okay.
[345:19.10]Okay.
[345:22.62]I got more fish, right?
[345:23.94]Look at that.
[345:24.32]Another fish.
[345:24.84]I already got it.
[345:26.41]Beautiful.
[345:26.95]What's this worth?
[345:29.01]Oh.
[345:29.65]I don't want it.
[345:30.57]Alright, let's get out.
[345:33.13]I got food.
[345:33.73]I'm ready to move.
[345:36.35]Frog is expensive.
[345:39.22]Is it?
[345:50.77]Oh!
[345:50.89]Oh!
[346:02.97]I thought that was just bullshit.
[346:04.37]Wow.
[346:05.05]Okay, that's a lot of money.
[346:08.22]That's a lot of money.
[346:12.96]Alrighty.
[346:14.26]Um... Well.
[346:19.27]That's about all I can do here.
[346:21.55]Any other people that I haven't spoken to that could potentially help me?
[346:25.57]I don't think so.
[346:26.81]Wait.
[346:34.54]2,000 for one day.
[346:37.26]No, that's not even worth it.
[346:38.60]What a waste of money.
[346:42.97]Let's go.
[346:44.69]Southwest.
[346:51.45]Dog?
[346:52.75]I got something for you.
[346:54.17]When you wake up from your unconsciousness.
[346:58.25]Come on.
[346:59.00]I'll pick you up.
[347:02.22]Can I pick the dog up?
[347:09.49]Check the other bar for a fence.
[347:11.57]I mean... Will there be a fence in here?
[347:18.91]How can I tell when somebody's a fence?
[347:26.60]Gecko.
[347:28.22]Uh, this woman-hating goddamn city is driving me mad.
[347:31.22]You hiring, Outlander?
[347:32.20]Promise I'll be good if you take me with you.
[347:34.50]What's your price?
[347:35.40]What's your fee?
[347:36.18]Got any skills?
[347:39.72]What's your price?
[347:41.74]3,000 cats.
[347:42.08]I don't have enough.
[347:47.85]Change your mind?
[347:48.51]I shouldn't have bothered.
[347:49.71]Damn it.
[347:54.11]Are you still 3,000?
[347:58.47]You can sell to the other faction?
[348:00.03]Yeah, I know, but I have to find the other faction.
[348:05.26]You know, I've pretty much only seen the Holy Covenant, or whatever they are.
[348:12.54]Go upstairs!
[348:15.40]See if we can find somebody upstairs.
[348:23.40]There's nothing up here.
[348:27.01]There are some beds.
[348:34.03]I'm ready to leave.
[348:36.35]I have a useless weapon.
[348:37.21]What about down here?
[348:37.83]There's a bunch of little stalls.
[348:46.12]Sell grog, get cats, hire muscle.
[348:49.52]I gotta find somebody to sell to.
[348:59.95]How long has he been carrying around his dead dog?
[349:02.61]Pretty much the entire game.
[349:08.27]That dog is going to be useful, though, eventually.
[349:10.31]Let me check over here.
[349:21.34]Where?
[349:23.36]Alright, bar.
[349:28.52]Oh, we got plenty of mercenaries in here.
[349:30.62]For free?
[349:36.78]Thief fence.
[349:39.10]Got things to sell.
[349:40.46]Oh, I do.
[349:42.38]You bet your ass I do.
[349:45.37]Stolen goods, no problem.
[349:49.53]That's a huge cut, though. $200?
[349:58.55]315?
[349:58.69]It's a fence.
[350:03.62]What do you expect?
[350:04.36]2200.
[350:16.95]I still don't even have enough.
[350:26.22]Sell the sake?
[350:30.23]I- 2400, I don't have enough to do anything.
[350:32.87]25?
[350:48.68]I have to go steal- I'm gonna steal more shit and come back to this guy.
[350:58.89]Alright, hold on.
[351:00.93]Remember where he is.
[351:02.51]I'm just going to go on a spree.
[351:11.56]Feed the dog.
[351:12.30]The dog is fed.
[351:14.02]As long as the dog hangs out on top of me.
[351:17.63]He will be fed every time.
[351:18.81]He's going to eat out of the inventory.
[351:19.87]Alright, what about up here?
[351:24.43]Well, time to go take more stuff.
[351:35.65]Am I allowed in this building?
[351:37.79]Yes, it's public.
[351:40.53]Alright, so, uh, hey!
[351:41.81]Can't wait to take all the shit in here upstairs.
[351:45.21]Hopefully it's worth something.
[351:47.55]We'll find out.
[351:49.89]Weaponsmith.
[351:51.21]Oh, okay.
[351:53.65]Maybe I should have sold the sword to the weaponsmith.
[351:56.69]There is a... big box right here.
[352:02.94]Uh, upstairs.
[352:03.74]Let's see.
[352:05.26]That's a big hunting party.
[352:09.70]One guy.
[352:10.26]Two, actually.
[352:12.92]But there are... There's a barrel right here.
[352:14.88]Save scummit.
[352:24.61]Sell value, uh, mercenary... I guess... Oh, shit.
[352:38.89]If a store lists an item at the front desk, it's somewhere in the store to steal.
[352:41.99]That's cool.
[352:47.32]Where am I?
[352:47.70]Alright.
[352:56.38]Ugh.
[352:56.50]What is this?
[353:00.10]But I can't really do it without being seen.
[353:08.71]I can't line of sight him.
[353:10.35]Now put the dog back up.
[353:18.84]Why is the dog going in and out of consciousness?
[353:20.56]Because he has not been well fed for a long time.
[353:22.78]There's a couple barrels.
[353:27.04]There's a chest back here.
[353:42.51]41% chance.
[353:42.73]413.
[353:42.75]You know what we're gonna do.
[354:11.14]Why is there a fat weirdo sneaking around with a large rat?
[354:13.72]It's my dog.
[354:24.23]It's just this club.
[354:25.21]That's all that's over here.
[354:28.15]46% chance.
[354:30.01]I'm assuming it's because he went away?
[354:32.37]Got it.
[354:33.07]Oh, yeah.
[354:35.59]Yeah.
[354:36.83]Yes.
[354:37.97]What?
[354:39.45]Holy shit, don't scare me like that.
[354:41.74]That was terrifying.
[354:55.05]I'm gonna need one of these.
[354:55.85]Ooh, okay, 47% chance.
[355:01.23]You know what to do.
[355:13.52]Has nobody told him?
[355:14.76]Why has nobody told him how to actually play the game?
[355:17.80]Oh, they have.
[355:23.08]Many times.
[355:33.96]No, he's in the store.
[355:38.78]Is this an opportunity to go take things in the store?
[355:43.72]The alarm just raised.
[355:45.10]You shouldn't be here.
[355:48.34]Oh, what am I gonna do about this, though?
[355:51.84]What am I gonna do about this?
[355:53.92]I've been safe-scumming all the way up here.
[355:55.29]I have to stay up here until morning.
[356:02.35]I stayed up here until the fucking store closed!
[356:05.77]Crap.
[356:08.81]I can sleep in a bed, can't I?
[356:13.18]Alright.
[356:13.74]If I sleep in bed, will they know it's me?
[356:18.83]This isn't mine.
[356:21.41]Oh no.
[356:21.89]I have to hide behind this.
[356:25.15]Until morning.
[356:27.33]This is bad.
[356:27.87]This is very bad.
[356:29.77]I have to get over here and I have to hide behind this and then go at super speed.
[356:48.51]I'm not softlocked, not yet.
[356:51.25]Get out of sneak mode and run.
[356:55.92]What are you doing?
[357:00.16]Oh man, this is very bad.
[357:03.78]Very, very, very bad.
[357:05.22]I softlocked myself up here.
[357:25.37]I'm gonna get out.
[357:26.01]Watch this friend.
[357:26.47]Ready?
[357:27.55]I have him in my hands.
[357:29.87]The game crashed.
[357:33.17]Oh, shit.
[357:42.95]No, I need to... Shit.
[357:47.22]That's not good.
[357:53.94]I'm coming back, coming back, coming back, coming back, coming back.
[357:56.24]Be there in a second.
[358:05.07]Learn the first floor through scum.
[358:07.09]Take the best stuff and run.
[358:25.97]New game?
[358:26.51]No, this is what we're doing tonight.
[358:27.83]I'm having a good time.
[358:28.73]I'm gonna- I'm not done.
[358:31.67]It's only eight o'clock.
[358:32.67]I got plenty of time.
[358:40.82]Which one is it?
[358:42.74]This one right here.
[358:52.44]You meant the stream was gonna end?
[358:53.54]Oh, no, no, no.
[358:55.10]I have to at least get somewhere.
[359:11.26]I stole shit, got some people, made a base, got fucked over by raiders and realized I couldn't hold my own and then I restarted.
[359:17.70]Alright, time to run.
[359:23.12]Why did he just put his hands up like Jerry Seinfeld?
[359:26.61]Out!
[359:28.17]Out!
[359:32.81]What are you doing?
[359:33.37]Stop getting scared!
[359:34.23]Go!
[359:34.51]Is the door... They locked me in.
[359:39.67]I can't leave.
[359:40.27]I have to accept my fate here.
[359:48.48]Wait, do I lose all my items that I stole?
[359:52.67]No.
[359:53.11]What about money?
[359:57.72]I have to try this one more time.
[360:03.46]Just hide until morning?
[360:04.50]I kind of can't.
[360:05.52]There's nowhere for me to go.
[360:07.69]Oh, the game crashed again.
[360:22.86]Load the save before it?
[360:24.16]That was almost like 20 minutes ago, wasn't it?
[360:27.00]Wasn't that a long time ago?
[360:30.70]It was 11 minutes?
[360:35.51]Alright, new music.
[360:45.21]Okay, how about... No, I did RuneScape not that long ago.
[360:50.32]Let's do...
[360:59.93]Can you jump off the building?
[361:00.73]I don't think you can.
[361:06.57]Has anyone ever even uploaded the Zoombinis OST?
[361:10.33]No.
[361:12.21]There's this one song.
[361:32.15]Make a new character.
[361:33.37]No!
[361:33.49]No!
[361:33.81]How about making a new character?
[361:48.32]We're gonna start all over again.
[361:49.93]And I'm gonna be even more useless than I am now.
[362:00.64]Sunk cost- Dude, this whole game is sunk cost fallacy.
[362:04.90]You're supposed to be a piece of shit.
[362:06.30]You're supposed to lose over and over again.
[362:08.02]You're supposed to have like a dead dog on your arm.
[362:10.26]Alright, we're leaving this town.
[362:28.37]See, he ate the bean.
[362:28.97]He's good.
[362:34.84]I gotta go to that fence.
[362:42.59]Alright, the other bar was back here.
[362:44.09]Alright, I can't, like, take this Zumbini song right now.
[362:54.31]Get the grog, grog!
[363:17.08]There you go.
[363:17.56]Okay, I gotta get the frog.
[363:23.46]Which one was it even in?
[363:25.78]Was it in the one that... the one I was just in upstairs?
[363:27.64]It's in this one.
[363:34.42]Yeah, it's up here.
[363:44.62]Back to bed.
[363:50.65]Okay, thanks for the grog.
[363:56.97]Let's go.
[364:09.70]Okay, fence.
[364:10.58]There's three... Oh, the camera is gonna kill me.
[364:15.64]Alright.
[364:16.54]There's two bars here.
[364:17.48]One, two, and there's one back here.
[364:21.17]There's no fence in here anymore.
[365:04.50]Upstairs?
[365:05.06]There's nobody up here.
[365:07.76]This is upstairs, Roger.
[365:11.70]Wrong building?
[365:12.65]No, that was the right building.
[365:13.53]It was all the way to the end.
[365:15.93]Wasn't it all the way to the end?
[365:16.85]The last bar?
[365:25.53]They aren't always in the bars.
[365:27.09]God damn it.
[365:33.86]I had him in the right spot, too.
[365:39.13]There's two?
[365:39.59]Oh, there's three bars.
[365:40.61]Let's just see if he's in this one.
[365:47.41]Um... No.
[365:52.12]Although... There's three of them.
[365:55.98]Where's the third guy?
[365:59.64]Weren't they hanging out together?
[366:07.10]Oh, god.
[366:09.36]The three of these guys hang out together.
[366:22.14]Shit.
[366:28.78]Well, that's not good.
[366:41.09]Because I can't sell any of this shit without him here.
[366:51.22]That was why having to reset and go back 10 minutes is... That's the problem now, because now I have to track this fucking guy down.
[367:11.56]And I have no idea which building this dude's gonna be in.
[367:15.12]Holy armor trader, no.
[367:30.38]Damn it!
[367:34.20]Looking for the fence?
[367:34.96]Yeah, I just went in all the bars already.
[367:37.96]Unless, like, are there any others?
[367:38.92]Is there a fourth bar in this town that I didn't see?
[367:49.73]I could have just sold you stuff there and then.
[367:57.72]I could not.
[367:59.18]There's only a 20% chance for me to sell anything in this town.
[368:03.10]Unless I sell to the one guy.
[368:05.20]And I lost him in this reload.
[368:10.77]Feed the dog?
[368:11.37]I might have to just cut my losses and leave.
[368:18.95]Because I'll run around here for the next two hours looking for this guy.
[368:26.48]Are you going to eat, dog?
[368:27.36]Come on.
[368:34.70]And all the food.
[368:35.61]What happened to all the food?
[368:38.85]Was that... Wait.
[368:39.83]Hold on a second.
[368:41.75]What happened to all the food that I stole?
[368:48.04]That was also lost in the quicksave.
[368:49.96]Oh, fuck!
[368:51.34]That's actually horrible.
[368:56.14]No, what?
[368:56.48]Didn't that get killed in the quicksave?
[369:13.32]I think it might still be in the chest.
[369:17.98]Alright.
[369:20.17]I'm kind of running out of options here.
[369:24.73]Because I have this... I have no idea who this guy would be.
[369:29.78]Whatever.
[369:31.06]I gotta leave.
[369:31.80]I can't just... Hey, welcome to the stream where I run around in circles looking for one guy to sell items to.
[369:36.58]No, we gotta go.
[369:50.40]Uh, alright.
[369:50.90]Dog, let's go.
[369:53.00]I have enough food here.
[369:56.80]Or, the only other option is I load the quicksave and just fucking run out.
[370:00.56]Try to just get out of the city.
[370:02.23]But the door's locked and closed because the store is closed.
[370:10.77]Alright, come here.
[370:16.90]All the dog is doing is eating your food.
[370:21.31]I had that plan too and that was gonna go so well.
[370:23.63]I just got locked into the store.
[370:26.63]Because I went upstairs.
[370:27.81]I had so much food.
[370:40.48]I had money.
[370:41.18]I have to try.
[370:45.88]I'm gonna save it here, but I like have to try.
[370:48.58]I mean, I lost so much.
[370:56.89]Like I lost way too much there.
[371:23.22]I'll just... It's gonna be... I just have to, like, try to get out somehow.
[371:28.15]Will somebody just open the door, maybe?
[371:30.81]I mean, just pick the lock really fast and, like, run?
[371:32.92]I gotta... Oh, fuck, it's... Go, go, get out!
[371:36.86]Get out of the city!
[371:49.84]I had it.
[371:51.58]Why am I up here with the store closed?
[371:56.55]Just hide until morning?
[371:57.65]I can't go anywhere.
[372:00.07]There's a guy literally right here.
[372:01.95]I just can't go anywhere.
[372:04.17]If I stand still?
[372:06.07]If I stand still, he's gonna see me.
[372:08.75]Wait, how does this guy not see me?
[372:10.17]No, he can see.
[372:10.75]What?
[372:11.23]I didn't even... Stardew Valley music is not helping.
[372:15.14]It's actually making me angry for some reason.
[372:27.48]So wait, everyone's telling me just don't move at all.
[372:33.10]No, there's no way this is going to work.
[372:37.24]I won't believe this at all.
[372:38.26]How is this working?
[372:42.23]This is not... No, it's impossible.
[372:44.69]That's impossible.
[372:49.63]Alright, so wait a minute.
[372:51.97]Wait a second.
[372:53.07]Wait till that guy goes down the stairs and then walk towards...
[373:03.77]So I'm gonna... I'm gonna wait till this guy go... I'm gonna go over here once this guy passes this way.
[373:11.02]Why did he see me this time?
[373:22.75]The game crashed.
[373:23.51]No!
[373:24.83]I was so close to like doing... getting money and leaving!
[373:36.01]I was upstairs for too long and I got locked upstairs.
[373:40.07]There's no way to get down and I have to hide and wait and... Oh, I had it done.
[373:44.44]It was done.
[373:44.90]It was done.
[374:17.93]Don't burn yourself next time with a useless dog.
[374:22.96]Well, I did pick the man and his dog character.
[374:26.86]If in 10 minutes I kill the dog and don't care, isn't that like, why even play that character?
[374:40.67]Okay, I'm not gonna touch anything.
[374:44.35]I'll just wait.
[374:44.93]He's gonna walk down here.
[374:45.83]Here's my chance.
[374:48.84]I'm gonna scum this like crazy.
[374:55.89]He came up so much quicker.
[374:56.87]Why did he come up so much faster?
[374:57.95]He doesn't usually come up that fast.
[375:27.78]There's RNG with how he comes up.
[375:32.69]Oh, I crashed it again because I'm... Alright, I'm going to do a new character.
[375:37.99]I can't... I'm just so fucked in this character.
[375:44.51]But I've put so much time into that character and it was fun and... I soft locked myself upstairs.
[375:52.04]Or I would have to run and mine for 20 minutes.
[375:55.72]Ugh.
[376:07.39]Just go to prison, I'm not gonna go to prison, I'm gonna die.
[377:29.15]YES!
[377:57.66]What time do they open?
[377:58.52]What time?
[377:58.82]I don't know when they open.
[377:59.54]When do they open?
[378:07.45]I saved over here because I didn't want to lock myself just in case somebody comes over and goes to sleep.
[378:13.53]I'm so glad I did this.
[378:15.38]I'm so happy.
[378:17.44]I'm not getting rid of the dog.
[378:18.86]I'm not making a new character.
[378:20.00]I got 25 fucking hundred cappies.
[378:23.13]And I got food.
[378:23.91]Look at all the food I got.
[378:25.21]Shitload of food.
[378:25.95]Shitload of fucking fruits.
[378:27.49]I got flowers up there.
[378:29.08]I got a shredder helmet.
[378:33.58]I've got everything.
[378:47.23]Holy, wait a minute, hold on, wait a minute, there's nobody down here.
[378:50.37]Oh boy!
[378:51.48]Oh boy, Jeremy, why don't you just leave the game?
[378:53.42]Huh?
[378:54.28]Just leave!
[378:55.76]Make a new character, for crying out loud!
[379:09.56]I got it!
[379:09.96]I did it!
[379:10.68]Holy shit, there's so many things in here!
[379:13.65]What?! !
[379:20.34]No!
[379:20.88]I didn't think... No!
[379:25.73]Which, I saved it, it's okay.
[379:32.41]I forgot... Everything's fine, don't worry, everything's fine.
[379:41.60]I'm gonna get back to the spot that I just was.
[379:48.21]Okay, I'm gonna peer...
[379:52.15]I can... Everyone's up there, though.
[379:54.09]Just steal the stuff that's in range.
[379:57.39]Take the things that you know you can take, that you're not gonna... I really didn't get in there, though.
[380:03.60]I have a bunch of... Anything that's worth money.
[380:09.04]What's the most expensive thing here?
[380:13.08]Meat.
[380:13.48]Armor plating.
[380:16.23]Armor plating.
[380:16.87]Fuel.
[380:17.35]Let's see how much it's worth.
[380:20.71]Pause the game.
[380:24.74]Building material, armor plating, that's a lot of money.
[380:27.50]That's how you pick up all of these.
[380:29.78]The Holy Flame.
[380:33.06]What the hell is that?
[380:33.88]Oh, shut up.
[380:44.59]You guys...
[380:45.25]What?!
[380:46.03]It's not even worth anything!
[380:53.59]Armor plating.
[380:54.11]I'm gonna have plenty of money now.
[380:56.73]Just clean this place out.
[380:58.39]Gears.
[380:58.89]If I can pick it up, just take it.
[381:03.26]We're getting close to time to wake up.
[381:05.08]Ceramic bolt.
[381:05.86]No, fuck the balls.
[381:08.48]Don't need them.
[381:09.02]Okay, hide over here.
[381:12.18]Save scum the chest.
[381:57.86]I'm getting a lot of good experience, though, from this.
[382:01.93]I got all night... Whoa, excuse me.
[382:04.47]I got all night to pick this.
[382:12.42]Just leave the dog in the store.
[382:14.36]They'll take better care of it.
[382:15.36]No, he's coming with me.
[382:25.95]The safe behind the counter.
[382:27.07]There's a safe right there.
[382:31.46]Wow.
[382:31.94]I can't.
[382:32.20]I'm gonna get all this stuff.
[382:35.48]Isn't the dog dying?
[382:36.24]Nope.
[382:36.44]Dog's doing just fine.
[382:41.31]What's the lock pick on the safe?
[382:42.37]7%.
[382:42.97]Alright.
[382:43.89]E, E, E, E, E. I'm gonna call this one, uh, chest is open.
[382:49.93]Okay.
[382:51.73]Okay.
[382:56.20]71% chance to steal these.
[382:57.25]And they're worth a lot of money.
[382:59.95]That's a lot of money.
[383:01.41]What is this, dog shit?
[383:04.18]Worthless.
[383:04.58]Get it out of here.
[383:08.14]What do I... I gotta... This stuff is worthless.

[383:42.38]Oh, fuck.

[384:35.80]That's done.
[384:36.24]It's saved.
[384:36.72]I'm good to go.
[384:57.23]Okay, scenario one is played out.

[385:34.78]4,000.
[385:34.80]4,000.
[385:34.82]4,000.
[385:34.84]76%.
[385:35.10]I need room.
[385:37.28]I need to make some room.
[385:43.00]Pause the game.
[385:43.54]I need a second.
[385:44.42]Hold on.
[385:50.63]No time.
[385:51.93]But, okay.
[385:54.43]Which one of these is the best one to take?
[386:01.52]I can take two.

[386:09.29]Ringed Saber, Paladin's Cross.
[386:17.39]Got it.
[386:23.74]This one's a thousand cell value.
[386:25.76]Definitely this one.

[386:59.84]Did I get it?
[387:00.48]No.
[387:01.00]Fuck.
[387:16.71]I didn't get it.
[387:18.45]Oh, but at least I have... I got one.
[387:21.07]Just get the other one and then get out.
[387:24.77]I have... I got plenty of time.
[387:26.85]Take it.
[387:27.71]Got caught stealing.
[387:43.21]You can take three if you move around the meat.
[387:45.27]No, I already have plenty.
[387:48.26]And I'm going to hire that guy.
[387:49.40]Because a range... No, I can't... Come on, this is 77% chance.
[388:01.21]Got it.
[388:01.37]Done.

[388:43.56]Grab the stick.
[388:45.22]No, I'm out of here.
[388:48.96]One.
[388:50.37]Two.
[388:51.77]Three.
[388:52.63]No.
[388:54.89]Let's get out and let's get it queued up to the door.
[388:59.93]Go!
[389:04.89]Just wait.
[389:06.03]This door's going to open.
[389:08.44]6am.
[389:08.68]Here we go.
[389:09.58]Walk out.
[389:10.26]Right at the front door.
[389:15.77]Open this door.
[389:21.35]This is the real timeline.
[389:23.93]Okay.
[389:24.37]Timeline has been saved.
[389:37.88]Okay.
[389:39.14]I'm ready for my first party member.
[389:50.35]Hey, remember me?
[389:51.11]Uh, where's the fence?
[389:54.64]Wrong one.
[390:01.74]Otto is eating.
[390:02.34]That's not even Otto.
[390:06.16]So where was the fence?
[390:12.68]Not in that bar.
[390:15.43]The dog is not dead.
[390:18.13]The dog is alive.
[390:21.74]The dog is- what do you mean the dog is dead?
[390:23.56]Where are you seeing this?
[390:26.60]What are you talking about?
[390:29.90]The dog is fine!
[390:31.22]Look!
[390:31.48]Okay, fence.
[390:45.64]Feed it!
[390:46.25]Look, it's already eaten!
[390:48.47]That arrow means he's already eaten.
[390:52.12]I got plenty of food for that dog.
[390:56.78]I need a fence.
[390:58.75]Bad.
[391:02.31]Check the bars.
[391:12.86]Sunk cost fallacy.
[391:14.34]Sunk cost fallacy.
[391:17.16]Is it a fallacy now?
[391:18.90]I just hit big.
[391:29.78]I want to hire you.
[391:31.68]Can you tell me about the first extinction?
[391:36.92]Uh... Happened again in Hawaii.
[391:39.12]Sounds like crazy talk.
[391:40.98]Keep looking for your wanderer.
[391:42.00]I don't care.
[391:42.46]This guy's dumb.
[391:51.89]Are we going to search for the fence again?
[391:53.15]Yeah, his cost is $9,000.
[391:59.25]Like, for what?
[392:03.15]No fence.
[392:05.29]Here we are again.
[392:08.17]With this bullshit bard.
[392:13.75]And I say, hey, wiggle on over this way, muffin, I tell you, huh?
[392:16.75]I tell you, I've never seen someone so... steam so fast, so I took the... Oh, glass is empty.
[392:21.25]Sorry, pal.
[392:21.65]Lend me some cash.
[392:22.23]I'll make it worth your while.
[392:23.13]I'm looking for fighters, not drunks.
[392:26.01]You wouldn't happen to be a fighter, would you?
[392:28.66]I tell you what, I'll sing you a song.
[392:32.63]Once I get bought, pay me 3,000 cat tab, and I'll sing you Tales Till the Sun Stops Setting.
[392:40.45]Get lost.
[392:46.44]No fence.
[392:48.24]Fence?
[392:48.60]No.
[392:55.38]Hire that guy?
[392:56.19]I need to sell him the things that I just took.
[393:01.91]Hire the bard?
[393:02.71]If I had money!
[393:05.23]Let the dog walk around?
[393:06.11]No, I'm saving his strength until he's at least 50%.
[393:12.36]Check up the stairs?
[393:13.14]Maybe sometimes they're up the stairs?
[393:14.10]Uh...
[393:36.02]Yeah!
[393:36.42]Yeah!
[393:36.82]Yeah!
[393:37.20]Yeah!
[393:37.98]Yeah!
[393:38.34]Yeah!
[393:38.72]Yeah!
[393:39.12]Yeah!
[393:39.56]Alright, here we go.
[393:43.66]Stolen goods, no problem.
[393:49.86]So, I... I want to keep one of these.
[393:53.68]What's the best one?
[393:57.43]Mid-grade, refitted blade.
[394:00.49]So they got hacker class.
[394:02.51]Defense bonus.
[394:04.69]Indoor penalty damage.
[394:06.77]Cutting damage, 52.
[394:07.67]This is probably the best one.
[394:12.92]Yeah, this one is 40, 24, 75.
[394:14.78]40.
[394:14.80]This is more blunt damage.
[394:21.80]Yeah, this is more cutting and got more blunt damage.
[394:33.28]And then we got 7813.
[394:40.33]That's pretty good.
[394:43.29]I think this is the one.
[394:47.31]0.78 cutting damage.
[394:50.02]Thank you.
[394:50.44]Take these off me.
[394:56.72]4100 bucks.
[394:58.74]Take this plating for all I care.
[395:02.17]Uh, this stupid, this book, every citizen has to have one by law.
[395:05.59]Uh, I don't know what this is.
[395:12.10]It's gears.
[395:14.36]We'll be playing.
[395:16.24]Fabrics, don't want it.
[395:19.06]Alright, what do you have here?
[395:21.71]Oh my god.
[395:23.37]Uh, should I just take this?
[395:26.57]Should I buy this from him?
[395:33.53]This store clerk is going to get arrested.
[395:35.47]No, no, no.
[395:37.97]Alright, I'm going to get the bard.
[395:39.13]Arrange.
[395:40.83]Arrange.
[395:41.29]Let's get rid of this book.
[395:43.63]Put this over here.
[395:44.61]Put the meat over here too.
[395:46.99]We got food.
[395:49.89]Cooked vegetables.
[395:51.53]Some fish still.
[395:53.39]That's all arranged nicely.
[395:55.80]Take the leather as well.
[395:57.40]And I'm going to put this in my weapon slot.
[396:04.47]Very cool.
[396:05.09]Let's go.
[396:07.45]4600 bucks.
[396:09.09]This guy better be worth it.
[396:13.61]Book, book, book, book, book, book, book, book.
[396:15.41]What do you mean book?
[396:18.76]What's wrong with the book?
[396:20.90]Don't do it.
[396:21.42]Don't crash.
[396:22.56]Oh no.
[396:29.50]Where was the save?
[396:30.50]No, I think we're okay.
[396:31.70]Oh my god, why?
[396:32.88]I didn't even do anything.
[396:39.34]I walked back up the stairs.
[396:52.37]I need to change settings.
[396:53.21]I'm running out of VRAM.
[396:58.61]Is that possible with the GTX 1080?
[397:00.05]What?
[397:19.38]I need more V-Bucks.
[397:23.48]Shadows.
[397:23.90]We'll turn this down to how much money I currently have.
[397:27.39]4,400.
[397:27.41]4,000.
[397:28.59]Alright.
[397:32.27]Real timeline is this one here.
[397:33.75]Now this is going to be different because... Oh, that's a pain in the ass.
[397:38.45]I'm going to have to find this guy again.
[397:46.67]Baby, you can afford katana and higher.
[397:55.51]But I need the money for food.
[397:56.79]The bard will do all the work.
[398:02.94]I'm sick, been asleep.
[398:03.76]Catch me up on this game.
[398:05.26]Game about starting from zero.
[398:09.63]Your character's worthless.
[398:11.59]Everybody's stronger than you.
[398:13.05]You're a wimp and you can't do anything.
[398:14.99]You have no money.
[398:16.13]And good luck and go enjoy the whole huge game.
[398:18.53]This is just a giant open world.
[398:20.09]You can do whatever you want.
[398:20.75]There are no rules.
[398:21.87]Have fun.
[398:28.48]Alright, uh, here we go.
[398:29.38]Let's go do exactly what we just did again.
[398:31.04]And find the bard.
[398:33.52]Not the bard, the, uh... Training dummy.
[398:38.98]Mark this on my map, because I'm going up there.
[398:42.24]And I'm gonna train, and I'm gonna be so much better, and everybody wanted me to save, scum, leave the game.
[398:45.86]Let's see if he's up there.
[398:53.23]Uh, he's not up here.
[399:00.73]Isometric kingdom come.
[399:03.95]Um... I mean, maybe a little bit, but... This is not like quests.
[399:12.87]I don't think.
[399:18.02]Well, this is the problem.
[399:19.70]Let's see if I can just walk around into bars again.
[399:24.84]Perfect.
[399:25.32]He's right here.
[399:25.82]Alright, don't crash.
[399:27.73]Crash.
[399:33.60]So again, we've got... I was going to hold on to the saber.
[399:37.61]This, this, this, this.
[399:42.21]All these.
[399:42.91]Keep, book, keep, book, keep.
[399:44.53]I'm going to keep the book this time.
[399:47.72]For some reason, I don't need two of them.
[399:50.40]Why do I need two?
[399:54.46]Rearrange.
[399:56.70]And 4,600. 4,600.
[400:03.43]Have I seen another person write an all-capitals sell book?
[400:08.49]Oh, boy.
[400:08.97]Are you trying to light a fire underneath me?
[400:16.60]Alright.
[400:16.84]I think we're good.
[400:18.52]Let's get this over here where it belongs.
[400:20.60]Splint kit and the meat.
[400:22.74]Range it nicely.
[400:26.62]We're golden.
[400:28.58]Saved.
[400:32.74]How's the dog doing?
[400:35.58]Pretty bad, not bad.
[400:43.51]So, this is the real question.
[400:45.77]Who do I hire?
[400:47.45]I have so much money right now to hire somebody.
[400:51.27]This is my first real friend.
[400:59.51]I want somebody that's capable, not some drunk guy that's gonna make me laugh.
[401:04.07]Alright, uh, let's check the bars.
[401:22.60]Dog is dead.
[401:24.70]Dog is very much alive.
[401:28.17]Alright, I can put the dog down, because now the dog... And I mean that physically.
[401:34.49]So you need to follow me.
[401:38.39]You have enough strength now where we can walk around together.
[401:43.40]Where's the bard?
[401:44.84]That's the bard.
[401:45.68]Alright.
[401:50.46]I'm looking for fighters.
[401:51.28]Not drunk, tell you what.
[401:53.00]Pay me 3,000 cat, and I'll sing you tales till the sun stops.
[401:58.94]How about a demonstration before I go all in?
[402:03.20]There once was a pixie above all the clouds.
[402:05.68]She soared with the zephyrs, gallant and proud.
[402:09.31]She went to the nyan-nyan-nyan, nyan-nyan-nyan-nyan crest and swam with something, something, something, her breast.
[402:15.59]She went to do, uh, I don't remember, but hey, make her a queen at the end, so pretty good, huh?
[402:24.64]Yeah, you're worth it.
[402:25.88]Bingo.
[402:27.25]Oh, we get to make them?
[402:29.60]We get to actually create this character?
[402:31.12]We get to create the character?
[402:34.00]This game just became like a 9.5 out of 10.
[402:36.80]It became like a 10.
[402:38.64]Really?
[402:39.70]That's fucking cool.
[402:40.94]That's really cool.
[402:42.48]Wow.
[402:43.54]I'm so happy.
[402:45.04]Okay.
[402:45.75]Yes!
[403:04.04]I'm just gonna have a bunch of weirdo dwarves except he's got like big baggy jeans on alright let's see idle stance
[403:34.98]what it's constantly holding his stomach alright he's constantly has indigestion leg shape yeah that's fine can you can I can I make like Glue Man
[404:03.18]I would make a Glue Man, you know what I mean, if I could.
[404:32.36]Just make him a frog.
[404:49.97]Sad eyes.
[405:08.91]If you didn't think we were gonna play this tomorrow... Oh, you... We're playing this tomorrow.
[405:17.60]You better believe it.
[405:24.73]Hair.
[405:26.83]I like it.
[405:29.05]No, no beard.
[405:30.25]Clean shaven.
[405:49.20]Well, he is a bard.
[405:50.34]The bard has to be like a blue hair or something.
[406:09.34]Why?
[406:09.68]Well, because the bard is like a YouTuber.
[406:11.52]Alright, we'll go with this.
[406:21.21]Holy shit.
[406:22.37]Great Canadian fuck club.
[406:25.20]Just gave $50.
[406:28.64]Thank you, Great Canadian.
[406:34.39]This kind of looks like Elon Musk.
[406:53.88]Not from the side, but from the front.
[406:55.56]It kind of does.
[406:57.72]Alright.
[406:58.32]I think we got a good one here.
[407:00.00]But seriously, thank you so much to Great Canadian for the $50.
[407:02.12]I love this.
[407:08.06]This is so... I'm so happy because that... Well... This... I seriously thought this was potentially like a 7.8.
[407:15.50]I was going to give this like a 7.9, right?
[407:17.30]I'm having a great time.
[407:22.67]Tard.
[407:23.09]It's interesting.
[407:24.75]But once it became very clear that it's not just, oh, you hire the bard and it's the guy that you saw at the bar.
[407:33.85]No, you can have a band of whatever the hell you want to make.
[407:39.08]That bumped it up a full letter grade for sure.
[407:41.22]Alright, name.
[407:48.66]It's rambling.
[407:51.00]Ugh.
[407:57.51]Now it just needs a car.
[408:01.13]No, no, I'm not... No, no, no.
[408:03.27]It's gonna be... Uh, frog musk?
[408:09.52]No, no, that's gross.
[408:10.30]That's weird.
[408:20.85]It's a bard and, uh, hold on.
[408:24.78]I gotta think about this.
[408:25.58]This is important.
[408:26.34]My main character's name sucks.
[408:27.70]This is the new main character.
[408:29.94]Sorry, you're gonna make up my own storyline.
[408:32.04]Main character?
[408:33.28]Sephiroth?
[408:34.70]Oh, he's terrible.
[408:35.52]No, no, no.
[408:35.88]This is the new main character.
[408:43.61]I mean, frog musk is whatever.
[408:45.33]That's fine.
[408:48.69]That means the hair has to be green.
[408:56.45]I'm ready.
[409:08.36]Why?
[409:09.14]Why do they have to be the same?
[409:11.94]Alright, we got, wait, see?
[409:14.80]It's Robin Hood and his band of merry men!
[409:20.65]Make sure that you're following him.
[409:22.69]Follow.
[409:24.45]Follow.
[409:27.59]Alright, let's do it.
[409:29.54]Do you have items?
[409:32.12]Everybody has their own inventory.
[409:35.00]Oh, dear.
[409:42.55]Alright, let's go.
[409:46.41]Where's the dog?
[409:49.11]Dog?
[409:50.17]Alright, here we are.
[409:51.89]Make sure we're nice and together as a unit.
[409:56.10]Look at this.
[410:01.31]Why is he so much faster?
[410:04.19]Match each other's speed, please.
[410:09.31]Alright.
[410:14.61]What time is it?
[410:15.94]Seven hours so far?
[410:20.12]Almost like what?
[410:20.76]We started pretty early, so hold on.
[410:25.78]Let me just save it.
[410:26.42]We're not going to stop.
[410:27.88]Not yet.
[410:30.70]Training dummy.
[410:31.22]We're gonna train.
[410:33.06]And then we're gonna see where we are in about like... We're not... Stream's not ending.
[410:37.31]I started at like 2 o'clock.
[410:39.33]Pacific, so it's only like 9pm.
[410:40.89]We've got plenty of time.
[410:43.05]So I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
[410:44.46]Grab another drink.
[410:45.80]And I'm gonna come back and we're gonna play a little bit more.
[410:48.16]See you in a minute.
[413:24.80]um sorry I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I actually do have to go because I have to take auto outside and it's going to be longer than probably like 10 15 straight minutes so I kind of have to like leave
[413:53.31]I have to take care of my real dog.
[413:54.85]I have to carry him.
[414:03.94]We can wait.
[414:04.88]We can wait.
[414:05.84]It's going to be like 15 minutes straight.
[414:08.56]No, no, no, no.
[414:09.88]Let's just pick up tomorrow.
[414:11.08]We're going to start at the same time tomorrow.
[414:13.91]We'll probably go for another 7 or 8 hours tomorrow too.
[414:25.85]Let me take a look over here.
[414:30.97]And the bits, yes.
[414:32.42]So here's what we're going to do with the bits because he's like, I have to take him out.
[414:37.36]So here's what we're going to do.
[414:39.14]I'm going to save, you ready for this?
[414:40.62]We're going to do a super, a super bit reading tomorrow night.
[414:48.58]Because I'm going to save all these.
[414:52.77]We're going to hang out for like at least a couple hours after the stream tomorrow.
[415:02.78]And, yeah, it's only 15 minutes, but I was going to end within the next, like, 30 to 40 minutes anyways, so.
[415:14.07]Don't do the dominoes dirty.
[415:15.55]Alright, well, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[415:18.21]I'm going to try to go, well, fine.
[415:19.75]Here's what we'll do.
[415:21.57]I'm going to go take him out.
[415:23.45]See if he'll go out.
[415:25.56]Give me a little bit.
[415:27.01]But the stream is over right now.
[415:30.55]So, I'll come back.
[415:31.67]We'll do the bits tonight.
[415:33.73]And I will see you guys tomorrow.
[415:36.17]Tomorrow, we're literally going to start exactly where we just left off on the first party character.
[415:42.20]I'm having it.
[415:42.70]I love this.
[415:51.64]My emotions were so up and down during this whole stream.
[415:54.98]But not bad.
[415:56.14]Not in a bad way.
[415:58.18]It was confusing.
[415:59.04]I was, where am I going?
[416:00.56]Who am I?
[416:01.14]What do I want to do?
[416:05.08]Even if I have no idea what the hell I'm doing, it's been kind of fun just being a dickhead and just dying and losing and running around and finding a party member.
[416:15.23]So, I will be back to do the bits.
[416:19.33]Just give me a little bit.
[416:20.99]I'm going to go as fast as auto.
[416:23.30]As long as it takes auto to go to the bathroom.
[416:26.42]Walk around for a little bit.
[416:28.24]Come back in.
[416:29.56]And I'm going to give him some food too.
[416:32.68]I'll see you tomorrow.
[416:33.38]If you're taking off.
[416:35.22]Same time.
[416:35.58]Probably 2 or 3 p.m.
[416:36.57]Pacific.
[416:37.89]And I will be right back.
[420:39.99]Hello there.
[420:43.24]I come back and see somebody says, Jerm was walking his dog.
[420:49.82]The house is on fire.
[420:51.28]15 minutes.
[420:56.55]That was like at least six or seven minutes.
[421:04.96]But at that point, if you're gonna leave... I already was doing the end of the stream voice, and it was already like, okay, it's time to... No, I'll be back!
[421:13.12]And then it's like, Otto has to go out, and you're gonna feed him, and it's like, eh.
[421:17.49]We'll just pick it up tomorrow.
[421:22.01]Rampaging Scrub just gave five community subs.
[421:27.27]Thank you so much, Rampaging Scrub.
[421:30.97]uh there's a lot of money tonight a lot of subscriptions and more than seven hours of bits keep playing do something else tomorrow oh no I want to play this I'm into this I want to have a shitload of people you may see this game for a little while here this is cool I like this
[421:59.75]So what I'm doing tonight, main game.
[422:03.68]This is a Kenshi stream.
[422:04.91]No, no.
[422:07.13]I'm going to spend some time just looking stuff up about character development and how to do things and get more familiar with it because this is... I think this is going to be fun.
[422:23.56]At least for one more full stream, right?
[422:26.80]We'll see after tomorrow if it's something that I still want to continue to do.
[422:33.44]So the seven hour was the tutorial, kind of.
[422:40.24]Any plans for New Year's Eve?
[422:41.24]Yes, I'll be streaming on New Year's Eve.
[422:43.72]We will have the ball drop on stream.
[422:49.93]Building a town and shit.
[422:51.15]Like, this is not just find RPG guys and go on missions.
[422:54.33]It's build a city together.
[422:56.73]I'm gonna have, like, 50 citizens in this town.
[423:00.20]Of all frog musks.
[423:03.94]It's very possible.
[423:10.92]But anywho, let's go back here and go through the bits.

[423:32.38]SticksRenegade, thanks for the $1.
[423:33.30]Ooh, we got the wrong screen on.
[423:37.40]That's the wrong screen.
[423:41.96]Thank you, SticksRenegade.
[423:42.74]You forgot, didn't you?
[423:43.68]I forget everything.
[423:45.02]Always.
[423:45.30]Not possible, but literally what you're supposed to do.
[423:53.56]What do you mean?
[423:56.08]Can I not do that?
[423:57.49]I thought I could do something like that.
[423:59.61]AggressionCow, thank you for the $15.
[424:04.07]Thank you, AggressionCow.
[424:06.23]Before I read it, let me just save the game here.
[424:10.79]I'm going to call this one a new beginning.
[424:15.77]Because I have frog musk.
[424:16.80]Everyone's here.
[424:17.44]Safe.
[424:17.64]Successful.
[424:18.20]We're good to go.
[424:18.76]Come on.
[424:21.64]Punch it.
[424:22.02]Push it.
[424:22.72]Come on.
[424:27.04]Exit the game because you'll hear the background noise.
[424:32.68]Alright.
[424:34.30]So, thank you Aggression Cow for the $15.
[424:35.53]Hey Germism, community members and I wanted to create something special for you for the holiday season.
[424:40.75]Hope you enjoy it.
[424:44.01]Let's take a look.
[424:50.31]This is called the 12 Days of Christmas.
[424:53.51]The 12 Days of Jermsmas.
[424:58.92]I'm going to hold on to this.
[425:00.16]We're going to save this for the end of the bit reading.
[425:03.05]We will watch this before we go.
[425:07.68]Let me just keep it tab open here.
[425:10.58]Thank you so much for this.
[425:11.74]I'm looking forward to watching it in about 20 minutes or so.
[425:17.08]Thank you for the $15 as well.
[425:18.26]Thank you Divus for the three bucks.
[425:20.17]Hashtag charity, thank you.
[425:22.85]Uh... Oh, here it... Oh, it's that... It's the name that I fuck up every time.
[425:27.31]It's the name that I screw up every single time.
[425:30.31]Uh...
[425:32.38]Itris Gara.
[425:33.66]Got it.
[425:35.54]Thanks for the one dollar, Itris.
[425:37.55]You making good use of those TMNT sippy cups?
[425:41.43]Uh, yeah.
[425:45.09]No, I don't have one here now.
[425:48.94]Thank you, though.
[425:49.40]Thank you, wonderful telephone for the five dollars.
[425:51.20]Just reached my first year sub.
[425:54.06]But I've been around since the MS Paint starting soon screen.
[425:57.32]I'm just less broke these days.
[425:59.06]Love you, bud.
[426:00.20]Also, this is your first character, but in real life.
[426:07.08]Uh, it's a guy, like, covered in peanut butter.
[426:08.85]I don't even... I don't... I don't even know that... I'm not... I'm not... I'm... Uh, thank you.
[426:15.83]Thank you so much for the five dollars.
[426:20.52]Yeah, the MS Paint just kind of turned into this.
[426:24.94]I'm probably going to change this, by the way.
[426:27.84]Well, I fucked it up.
[426:32.17]So, by the way, in case you're wondering, Jerma Expensive is going to become a base emote.
[426:39.23]And it's going to be changed into Jerma 1 Guy.
[426:48.31]That fits more as one guy than it does as expensive, in my opinion.
[427:00.94]So that's gonna become a base emote, and then... I don't know what I'm gonna do for the $25 sub is just... Like, that's so much.
[427:07.04]I'm gonna put like an X there.
[427:19.34]Which one guy told you to do that?
[427:22.14]Um... It might have been in the Discord.
[427:24.68]Maybe one guy said it in the Discord that it would be good to... I don't know.
[427:29.17]I'm sure one guy told me to do that.
[427:30.43]Don't worry.
[427:30.77]Hey, Duke!
[427:35.97]Duke, what's going on?
[427:36.83]Thanks for the $10.
[427:39.27]Not gone yet.
[427:40.98]And what the hell was I watching?
[427:42.10]Jerma, just show auto and you'll get thousands of bits.
[427:46.87]No.
[427:47.45]I don't need to... It's alright.
[427:50.03]You guys know Otto's around.
[427:51.81]He actually was behind me the whole time.
[427:54.19]Sleeping in a little bed that I made for him.
[427:58.51]But you were watching Kenshi.
[428:02.18]It is a pretty wild game.
[428:04.28]But one that I currently think is fun to do.
[428:08.78]Thank you so much, Duke.
[428:09.68]I'm not sure when you leave.
[428:12.34]But good luck when you do.
[428:15.91]Not sure what the date you're leaving is.
[428:22.69]The link I sent broke?
[428:24.27]Well, that's not good.
[428:27.47]Show us the dog.
[428:28.45]No, he's eating.
[428:31.47]But thank you so much, Duke.
[428:37.27]Much love to you, and good luck.
[428:42.10]And again, thank you for $10.
[428:43.40]That's incredibly kind of you.
[428:46.78]smelly but we demand the dog vessel no I he's down there he's get there's a piece of meat in front of him when he gets up from no now that's like a bad never mind because I was that implies that he's like down there lying down no because I was making a reference to the stream dog I told you I didn't want that dog to be auto I don't want that dog connected to auto at all so that's not what's gonna happen the auto is doing just fine downstairs eating his dinner dog food
[429:18.19]Thank you, Smellyboy, for the $1.
[429:19.67]Even given, uh, ever given thought to playing any of those combat strategy games like Total War, Civ, Nice Try, or Mountain Blade, uh, would be fun to watch you try those.
[429:33.64]Um, not really.
[429:39.10]Not really.
[429:41.90]Mountain Blade is something that's requested a lot.
[429:47.24]Total War seems cool, because can't you have 10,000 units on the screen at the same time?
[429:51.74]It might be fun to make a custom map or something.
[429:57.96]No, those are not for Jerma.
[429:59.42]Those are not.
[430:00.08]Nice try.
[430:00.64]He tried to... He wrote a word here.
[430:04.94]And he thought I was going to stumble over it and just say it.
[430:08.45]Almost.
[430:10.44]You need fast-paced games for this boomer.
[430:13.34]What about the game we played to- the one that I was just on tonight?
[430:16.27]That's a fast-paced game?
[430:19.01]People were screaming at me when I was mining.
[430:27.11]I was trying to slow it down and everybody in chat is like, excuse me sir, would you please step on the gas and hold it down until you touch the floor?
[430:45.41]No, I- look, listen.
[430:48.66]This game I know has like a lot of people that are big fans and that probably spent a lot of time in it.
[430:54.48]And it's fucking awesome because it seems like a great game.
[431:00.28]I get it.
[431:01.00]I understand.
[431:04.09]But I need to, like, mine the dumb ore to make enough money to buy the dog food.
[431:11.90]You know what I'm saying?
[431:19.07]But, thank you, smelly boy.
[431:20.59]Thank you, Keldos, for the $1.
[431:22.21]Etalyx did a great job with the effects.
[431:24.97]Hashtag charity.
[431:26.29]Oh, yeah.
[431:27.33]I loved it.
[431:41.67]so if you're curious about that um I loaded up a shitload of sound effects and music files and they were just on a button press and I'm like hey dude you have full disk creative control he's like you're gonna give me full create I've he's like I have full creative control I'm like dude yeah do whatever the fuck you want
[432:06.28]Except that obviously like the voice changer was there for Bugleberry.
[432:11.39]I mean both, like voice changer as in like, you know, that's his real voice.
[432:16.89]What software is it?
[432:17.63]It's a stream deck.
[432:23.33]Yeah, the placement on a lot of those sound clips there are fucking perfect.
[432:29.45]Explain that clip?
[432:32.37]What's wrong with this one?
[432:34.64]I mean, it's a voice changer of some sort.
[432:44.17]He pressed a button that was called, like, distortion effect.
[432:48.39]If you look closely, look at my mouth, I say, I say, Hey!
[432:53.79]And for some reason, he pressed the button at the right exact time to distort it and added, like, a monster effect to it.
[432:59.49]I went, Hey!
[433:00.41]Yeah.
[433:02.51]Yeah.
[433:05.32]So, I mean, that's the explanation for that.
[433:12.71]But if you remember the first time Bugleberry was on stream, I didn't have a, like, stream deck.
[433:20.28]I was opening up random tabs to have scream noises and stuff.
[433:23.86]So it was so much more seamless for him just to have a fully loaded board with sound effects for him just to do it whenever he wanted to.
[433:32.62]So, nah, I watched that stream back and I had a lot of fun.
[433:37.64]It was kind of hectic though because we had to build up and take down essentially a random bunch of stuff that we put in the way.
[433:47.52]And we had to be out, out at the, locked out of the studio.
[433:52.52]No ifs, ands, or buts.
[433:53.78]We had to be out at 9pm.
[433:56.90]So, there was no, oh, can we like stay?
[433:59.70]No, we had to clean up and shit, so.
[434:02.38]If you're wondering why that stream had to be kind of done after three hours, it's because of that.
[434:11.94]Boomer watches his own streams.
[434:14.52]Well, I wanted to make sure it went alright.
[434:17.01]I mean, that was, you know, that was kind of an ordeal.
[434:27.85]How long did it take to clean?
[434:30.09]Uh... We cleaned up real, real quick.
[434:35.56]It took about three or four straight hours to put it all up, and then it took about... When you get locked in, just disassemble, put everything in boxes, get it out.
[434:45.29]It's probably like an hour and a half, maybe an hour.
[434:47.88]Right when the stream turned off, we got going.
[434:51.64]But I'm glad people thought it was fun.
[434:53.36]I had a lot of fun.
[434:56.13]I have a lot of, uh... Because I wanted to see the chat, too, you know?
[434:59.61]I didn't get to see the chat for most of the entire stream.
[435:03.12]And it's fun to kind of go back and see what... You know, I wanted to see what you guys were saying.
[435:07.10]I think it's fun.
[435:07.66]You guys are saying some funny shit, so... But, that's, uh, that's that.
[435:16.76]Uh, thank you Supeset again for the $50.
[435:18.70]Happy late Christmas.
[435:20.60]Hope you had a good one as well.
[435:21.64]Thank you for the $50.
[435:23.10]Lots of money.
[435:24.16]Sly161, thanks for the two bucks.
[435:25.82]Hey Jerma, did you hear that?
[435:27.24]Uh, Macaulay Culkin is gonna change his name.
[435:30.88]To Macaulay, Macaulay Culkin, Culkin.
[435:36.06]Is that real?
[435:36.52]Uh, when are you gonna change your name to Jerma985?
[435:46.21]Thank you, Peaceful Hayley, for the $1.
[435:47.33]Hey, Jeremy, I was wondering what your favorite thing you got for Christmas was off-stream.
[435:51.39]And I recently dabbed for you.
[435:56.11]Those are the... I recently dabbed for you.
[436:05.36]So you don't feel bad about dabbing.
[436:14.64]God.
[436:16.95]I don't feel bad about dabbing because I never did it.
[436:21.52]Stop dodging the question.
[436:22.32]What's my favorite thing from Pressures Offstream?
[436:24.68]I got a nice mug.
[436:27.16]My mother sent me these great gold foil playing cards.
[436:31.77]Because, oh, you moved to Vegas.
[436:33.37]Here, let's go.
[436:34.19]And they're really, really nice.
[436:34.97]They're really cool.
[436:36.43]Really sentimental kind of thing from my mother.
[436:38.17]That was really nice of her.
[436:47.29]And... Oh!
[436:51.55]Listen to this!
[436:52.91]Whoa!
[436:53.99]Hear this one, guys.
[436:55.63]Remember when I talked about Tile?
[436:57.91]And I went off on, like, a four-hour-long rant about how I hated Tile so much?
[437:02.81]The little beep things for your phone so you can find your keys and stuff?
[437:06.59]And I talked about how shitty they were and how it was the worst product ever because you can't replace the battery.
[437:11.04]You have to, like, sign up for their subscription program.
[437:16.12]Because when they die, you can't replace a battery.
[437:17.94]You have to be like, hey, give me some new ones.
[437:19.52]I need to buy new ones now.
[437:21.58]Right?
[437:26.96]They have batteries now.
[437:30.34]Tile now has batteries that you can replace.
[437:33.28]I wonder who got that to happen.
[437:47.44]No, I had like... I probably had fucking nothing to do with it.
[437:51.66]But Tile now has a battery, a replaceable battery.
[437:56.43]So... I got new Tile for Christmas.
[438:08.23]You were the only person to ever complain about that.
[438:11.50]I know, right?! !
[438:16.81]Imagine if I was that much of like a fucking egomaniac.
[438:23.11]That I really thought that that was why.
[438:28.46]There are 60 billion people in America.
[438:33.12]And like one person that just has like, you know, a few thousand people hanging out?
[438:36.59]No.
[438:47.22]What if the president of Tile tweeted at you?
[438:49.40]I'd be like, um, that... Your products are great.
[438:53.04]They're really, like, I just, like, flew off the handle one night because, like, I lost my keys and I couldn't find them and the Tile was dead.
[439:01.26]And they say they have a one year, oh, up to one, it's a one year lifespan.
[439:04.76]It was like six and a half months.
[439:06.40]It was just bullshit.
[439:09.40]Two of the tiles, me and Kim both bought them.
[439:11.94]And I think two of them were just gone, dead, after like seven months.
[439:16.69]And the other two lasted for a year.
[439:24.94]But, I digress.
[439:27.02]I got new ones.
[439:28.18]Let's see, I am not gonna tell, look, I'm gonna hold my judgment.
[439:32.32]I will amend my statement.
[439:39.93]750% of the world's population is in America.
[439:44.05]Yeah, there's 4 billion people in Alaska.
[439:48.55]There's... I think there's, like, 11 billion people in LA.
[439:53.40]25 billion people in New York City.
[440:00.56]And then because, like, you know, the heartland of America, like, the big... There's only, like, 60,000 people that live in those 12 states that go on, like, kind of the belt there.
[440:27.16]And one cow in Wyoming.
[440:29.22]Hey, from what I hear, Wyoming's a pretty great state, from what I hear.
[440:36.90]Somebody told me, like, you know, it's Wyoming.
[440:38.46]It's actually nice.
[440:39.28]I was like, really?
[440:40.75]Yeah, okay, that's cool.
[440:41.71]Well, maybe one day I'll go there.
[440:51.97]It was one guy, but that's fine.
[440:55.92]Hey, thank you to, uh, G-G-Doran.
[441:03.20]Thank you, G-Doran, for the $10.
[441:05.20]No message, thank you.
[441:10.18]Thank you, Gen V, for the $1.
[441:12.20]Hey, Junior, go make me my Milky.
[441:15.80]What?
[441:17.66]I don't know if I, I don't know what that means, but I'm afraid to read it.
[441:20.96]Uh, G-Doran, again, thanks for the $5 on top of your $10, so thanks for $15.
[441:27.74]Sad Vega, thanks for the $1.
[441:29.54]Last day to donate to the charity.
[441:32.05]Got bits left over, so have some bits for the boomer humor you give us.
[441:35.31]Hashtag charity.
[441:38.89]I appreciate that.
[441:39.53]Thank you.
[441:43.15]Tickles the Barbarian, thanks for the $10.
[441:46.63]God bless you, Jerma, for playing this game.
[441:48.25]It's my favorite.
[441:52.48]I'm beginning to see why.
[441:54.88]It does seem like an immense RPG sandbox.
[442:04.48]But thank you for the $10.
[442:07.76]And I'm happy to be playing your favorite game.
[442:11.86]Thank you IamMonk for the $1.
[442:13.50]I've watched so many ads recently for these.
[442:15.42]Enjoy.
[442:15.90]Hashtag charity.
[442:18.42]Thank you for suffering through advertising.
[442:22.22]For my sake.
[442:23.44]Thank you.
[442:26.22]The thought that somebody would do that is, thank you.
[442:30.14]Hydra, thanks for the $1 Hydra.
[442:31.58]Last stream during the best clips part, you played a clip from Dark Souls 2 and you only had one Estus Flask.
[442:38.67]Didn't Star teach you that the first thing you do in Majula is get the flash in the wall?
[442:43.49]God, you never learned.
[442:46.69]Yeah, but that whole playthrough of Dark Souls 2, uh, I went back about 10 minutes later, because I went the wrong way.
[442:53.75]I went through, um, the Hide Knights are, you have to go through the Forest of the Lost Giants, and I went through that, I mean, that whole, there's, there was like six or seven Dark Souls 2 streams, but I just thought that was like such a funny moment when I like rolled off the edge.
[443:16.38]But thank you, Hydra, for the $1.
[443:17.62]Thank you, IamMonk, for the $1.
[443:18.64]They say, hi, hashtag charity.
[443:20.04]Thank you.
[443:21.62]Again, for a dollar, IamMonk, made you look, jebaited, hashtag charity.
[443:26.21]You can make me, you can jebait me all you want.
[443:30.05]With that hashtag charity there.
[443:33.41]Thank you.
[443:36.78]Mr. Sneakman, thanks for the $1.50.
[443:39.46]Activate sneak.
[443:40.64]Vessel.
[443:41.06]P.S.
[443:41.38]What's your favorite stream of the year so far?
[443:43.68]P.P.S.
[443:44.12]Are we going to get a New York's... A New Year's Rumble like last year?
[443:48.62]P.P.P.S.
[443:49.65]Haha, you said... The... The letter comes after O twice.
[443:58.59]But that's okay.
[444:00.41]Favorite stream of the year... There are two, buddy.
[444:03.42]Um...
[444:06.91]I don't know.
[444:07.25]I can't tell you.
[444:09.47]I have too many streams this year that I really, really was like, holy shit.
[444:14.80]I had a lot of fun.
[444:17.22]I can't really single any out.
[444:19.60]What's the worst streams of the year?
[444:20.88]I could probably tell you.
[444:21.80]Um... What's the worst stream of the year?
[444:26.73]Hmm.
[444:33.15]Don't say... Labo.
[444:33.93]No, Labo would be in the top five for me.
[444:35.61]Sorry.
[444:44.19]This one.
[444:46.49]Karazhan was not even this year.
[444:52.33]The second Hotline Miami 2 stream?
[444:54.83]No.
[445:05.84]It stressed us all out too much.
[445:07.58]But that's the point of that game.
[445:09.68]The birdhouse, that would be... I liked that stream.
[445:11.92]I had a lot of fun.
[445:14.14]The birdhouse was pretty bad.
[445:17.03]What was wrong with the birdhouse?
[445:30.28]The birdhouse was easily the worst.
[445:41.76]Yeah, but that was too recent.
[445:43.06]Okay, but besides the birdhouse.
[445:51.96]Vampyr was the worst stream?
[445:54.18]Yeah, but was that because that was the worst stream or was it because that was like the worst game?
[446:05.52]You know, am I at fault for that when a game is not that great?
[446:17.51]Yes.
[446:21.65]Game... Okay, alright, alright.
[446:23.61]I'm gonna have to tell you.
[446:24.93]Gamer V Portable, Dalek says.
[446:28.12]I don't know if I agree with you.
[446:30.58]The Gamer V Portable stream was... I mean, awful, but... I liked it.
[446:46.26]Everyone forgot about Immortal Unchained because it was so bad.
[446:57.91]I'll give you Gamer V Portable though because that was so... The whole... I couldn't get it captured.
[447:02.63]Yeah, I'll say Gamer V Portable is probably the worst stream I did all year.
[447:10.37]In a technical sense.
[447:12.65]Just like technically speaking, that was probably the worst stream I've ever done.
[447:17.10]I thought that stream... I liked that stream.
[447:28.82]That's why I'm not sure I agree with the game review portable pick here for worst stream of the year.
[447:36.65]The Minecraft stream was bad?
[447:38.45]Yeah, but does it count if I was drunk?
[447:41.30]You know what I mean?
[447:43.14]Like, if I'm like drunk and gonna play a game, like does that count as like- that was like a 10 minute drunk guy joke.
[447:49.10]Does that- that doesn't count as a stream.
[447:50.64]That doesn't count.
[447:56.24]You can't- okay, you can't take a portion of one stream where
[448:12.92]The Labo streams were torture.
[448:32.02]Local stream stays drunk to excuse bad streams.
[448:35.38]I've been drunk on stream like four times ever.
[448:39.44]In three years.
[448:45.48]Come on.
[448:48.80]That's bullshit.
[448:49.78]What?
[448:54.55]Like, drunk on stream.
[448:58.57]That, I, I, that, what?
[449:03.90]You did three Labo streams and got drunk during all of them.
[449:06.60]No, what are you talking about?
[449:11.40]I got drunk on one of those Labo streams.
[449:14.10]One of them, I was having some drinks, but I wasn't drunk.
[449:25.84]There's a difference between drinking and drunk.
[449:38.49]You got drunk and ate taquitos on your final day in Boston.
[449:41.24]Yeah, that's one of four times.
[449:56.77]We had to watch a boomer get drunk and build cardboard for four hours.
[449:59.93]I can't wait till another Labo comes out.
[450:05.83]I'm doing it.
[450:06.27]I'm gonna do it again.
[450:21.94]I'm going to do it again.
[450:22.52]I'm going to do it nice and slow.
[450:24.75]I'm going to take my time.
[450:26.81]And I'm going to drink tea when I do it.
[450:35.76]But anyways, moving on.
[450:48.22]Thank you, Hasnain, for the $1.
[450:49.60]I left and cooked dinner for two people and you still failed to achieve anything in the game.
[450:53.17]I actually did not fail to achieve anything in the game.
[450:57.51]I achieved a lot.
[451:00.13]I made a dog friend that I kept alive and now that dog is going to be around.
[451:05.34]If I had left that dog six hours ago, I wouldn't have a band of merry men.
[451:11.18]That is three strong.
[451:20.48]The last 30 minutes of that stream... was somebody- yeah, somebody just said it was- it was incredibly valuable.
[451:28.08]I'm doing alright.
[451:30.14]Thank you, SadVega, for the $1.
[451:31.43]Make him look like you so we can RP you in this world with auto at your side.
[451:35.19]Hashtag charity.
[451:36.67]Thank you.
[451:44.39]I'm realizing now that I have to feed another person.
[451:47.13]That's gonna be interesting.
[451:49.66]Thank you, Sad Vega, again for the dollar.

[452:46.50]And I love you and hope you had a good Christmas, my friend.

[453:36.68]I'm fucking laughing at you hitting this dog for the past hour.
[453:41.78]When did I hit the dog?
[453:50.89]I did not hit that dog once.
[453:55.71]Oh, you know what?
[453:56.29]The Subnautica streams were this year.
[453:57.95]Those weren't bad.
[453:58.85]What was wrong with those?
[454:02.05]What was wrong with the Subnautica streams?
[454:03.45]I thought they were fun.
[454:21.52]But thank you, Mr. Pigeon.
[454:24.82]Drunk?
[454:25.16]Hopefully you're, uh... Hopefully you're doing alright.
[454:31.38]Take care of yourself.
[454:32.02]Don't drink too much.
[454:34.44]But I'm glad you had a good time.
[454:35.39]Thank you.
[454:37.29]Uh, Jay Paul thanks for the $1.94.
[454:39.97]Please don't mine any more copper.
[454:45.11]That was during the mining part.
[454:47.01]But the person told me I wasn't funny.
[454:50.75]That hurt.
[454:51.35]That did.
[454:51.89]Like, that stings.
[454:55.81]You know, that stung the ego a little there.
[454:57.67]It did.
[455:02.82]I put on like the mining song and I was like pretending to do like a dwarf accent.
[455:08.18]Somebody was just like, that was not funny, man.
[455:09.88]Like you're trying too hard or something.
[455:11.14]And I was like, fuck.
[455:13.20]Fuck.
[455:14.16]Um, sorry.
[455:29.76]But it's all good.
[455:39.36]They're probably just messing around, and... But yeah, it made me laugh because... I mean, I'm like... I'm sitting there going like, oh, hit the stone and find some more ore!
[455:54.52]It's like, dude, that was terrible.
[455:56.08]I'm just like, oh fuck!
[455:58.02]I'm getting booed!

[456:31.44]Merry late Christmas.
[456:32.24]Keep the change.
[456:33.44]You filthy animal.
[456:37.49]Thank you.
[456:37.85]They say hashtag charities.
[456:39.81]Well, how much has been raised?
[456:41.15]I'm curious.
[456:45.99]It's like almost a half a million dollars or something, right?
[456:50.57]Almost half a million dollars.
[456:52.10]Nice.
[456:52.46]That's awesome.
[457:06.12]Good.
[457:06.56]That's really good to hear.
[457:10.59]C4G, thanks for the $1, do the mining joke again.
[457:13.39]Oh, right, because everyone was yelling at me.
[457:17.71]Because they were saying, no, he's doing the mining joke, but the mining joke wasn't a joke.
[457:21.50]I was actually just trying to mine so I could make money.
[457:25.58]There was no comedy there.
[457:28.60]And then I added, because it's the mining joke, I added the fucking thing with the dwarf voice, and then a guy got mad at me.
[457:36.29]There was a whole spiral downward there.
[457:46.31]But thank you for the one doll.
[457:47.13]Thank you, Grayfeld, for the five dolls.
[457:50.81]I've been depressed lately and your streams have been awesome.
[457:52.87]Keep it up.
[457:54.87]Hope you feel better.
[457:58.87]Thank you for the five dolls and thanks for hanging out.
[458:06.52]Don't let the one guy hurt your ego.
[458:08.42]Yeah, but that would go against my one guy policy.
[458:11.86]You know what I mean?
[458:21.81]But thank you, uh, thank you, Grayfeld.
[458:25.72]Take care of yourself.
[458:28.64]Hopefully we see you soon.
[458:30.84]Sad Vega, thanks for the $1.
[458:32.23]Hey, Jerma, everyone's screaming about a prospect button that may or may not do something.
[458:36.39]Hoping you notice this smiley, winky face.
[458:39.34]I figured it out.
[458:41.95]There's no manual.
[458:42.68]There's no instructional manual.
[458:43.96]There was just a few tutorials.
[458:45.84]Welcome to Dark Souls.
[458:46.90]You know what I'm saying?
[458:47.58]Welcome to Dark Souls.
[458:49.34]Gotta learn.
[458:49.98]You gotta die.
[458:50.58]You gotta lose.
[458:51.24]You have to have one toughness.
[458:52.87]Because you keep save scumming and you're not improving.
[459:01.25]Sorry.
[459:01.57]The bard will have like 30 toughness.
[459:03.66]And I'll just stand behind him.
[459:11.03]But thank you, SadVega.
[459:11.99]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[459:14.41]There is no feasible way this stream will make it to 2ndJerma.
[459:17.92]I disagree.
[459:22.60]I think I disagree with that.
[459:23.50]I don't know, does it?
[459:30.81]Did carrying the dog improve strength?
[459:32.65]Maybe it might have.
[459:40.93]It's different if the dog dies.
[459:42.33]I don't care if canned Roth gets hurt, but you gotta protect Massamoon.
[459:50.85]How long has it been since you edited your own videos?
[459:53.13]Three days.
[459:53.51]Because I made those clips that were put on the Christmas Eve stream.
[460:02.80]Three to four days.
[460:12.54]Yep.
[460:13.78]Yep.
[460:18.42]Thank you, Darkstar, again, for the $1.
[460:19.92]Thank you, Garon, for the $1.
[460:22.78]Thank you, Flim.
[460:24.18]Thank you for the $100.
[460:25.50]Again, thank you for $100.
[460:29.60]Gosh darn dollars.
[460:30.64]Thank you, Flim.
[460:31.92]Flim flam.
[460:33.92]Sad Vega, again, $1.
[460:35.66]I support your efforts to be annoying and slurp.
[460:38.52]ASMR stream, go.
[460:43.98]I forget how much people just hate that shit.
[460:45.80]I'm sorry.
[460:46.30]I'm just a fucking idiot.
[460:48.16]I forget, like, I'm in my own world up here sometimes.
[461:01.39]Thank you, Heartbroken Samurai, for the six dollars.
[461:06.29]Papa Jerm, next week I'm going to Japan for a few months to do... to a sushi school.
[461:13.15]Can you wish me luck?
[461:13.98]I'm nervous.
[461:14.56]Here's some money for some coffee.
[461:15.70]By the way, where the hell is Wailord and the socks?
[461:21.34]Well, first of all, going to Japan to... Are you gonna be a sushi chef?
[461:33.39]That's really cool.
[461:37.92]That's one of those things where I hope in an alternate universe I'm doing something like that.
[461:42.68]That's awesome.
[461:46.32]Don't be nervous.
[461:47.02]You're gonna knock it out of the park.
[461:48.30]You're gonna be just fine.
[461:52.72]And where is Wailord?
[461:56.28]Fuck, I got lost in shipping.
[461:57.84]It was like a seven to ten day ground shipping and I got lost in the mail.
[462:02.59]You know I got lost in the mail?
[462:08.91]Anytime anybody says that, it means that they didn't do it.
[462:11.79]They didn't do the thing that, you know what I mean?
[462:15.22]Hey, uh, so, I'm looking for, um... You were supposed to send me a package?
[462:20.34]Oh, yeah, yeah, it must have got lost in the mail.
[462:23.72]What does that mean?
[462:31.71]Like, the mail lost it.
[462:33.81]And I know that happens sometimes, but it never truly happens.
[462:39.30]We have tracking numbers now.
[462:40.58]You can't use that.
[462:41.70]You can't use that fucking term anymore.
[462:44.60]Maybe like 60 years ago, when UPS didn't have an online... You could see every stop that the guy's at with a tracking number.
[462:54.18]Hey, I got lost in the mail.
[462:56.34]Oh, shit.
[462:56.74]Okay, so we don't have computers, so you... Okay, thanks.
[462:58.98]You're a liar, but... Oh.
[463:06.30]Anyways, um... It'll be here soon.
[463:16.32]Thank you, Heartbroken Samurai.
[463:18.02]I wish you luck in Sushi School.
[463:22.70]Take care.
[463:23.08]I'm not sure where you're going from, but if it's a long way, good luck.
[463:29.31]I'm sure you'll do just fine.
[463:31.91]Hey, eDragon, thanks for the $15.
[463:34.37]Is this enough to get you to play the Spyro 2 OST?
[463:37.76]Yeah, you know what?
[463:38.56]That is.
[463:38.88]$0.
[463:40.72]Just say it in chat, and I'll play it.
[463:45.98]We'll start with the Spyro 2 OST tomorrow.
[463:52.50]But thank you for the $15.
[463:53.36]And hashtag charity.
[463:57.98]Thank you.
[464:00.25]Garfield, the Monday killer, thanks for the $1.
[464:02.11]Here comes Garfield, master of the baloney.
[464:05.61]Garf is here to say how much I loved your Earthbound stream.
[464:08.64]It's way different than I remember and so and so forth.
[464:11.74]Joke over, how was your Christmas?
[464:13.42]Pretty Garfy, I hope.
[464:14.76]The face of disgust you gave when you saw Garfield present was hilarious.
[464:19.00]I didn't even suggest it.
[464:20.18]I trusted the Jerma community to give me some Garfin publicity and they didn't disappoint.
[464:24.69]Special thanks to Etalyx for inviting me into the stream.
[464:27.59]Here's some fun background info about that.
[464:31.21]So, um... Etalyx, on my Amazon, is the one that... Kim wrapped the gifts, and Etalyx is the one that made the order on my Amazon, right?
[464:44.40]So, he made the order, and I walked into the room after he told me, yeah, you can come in.
[464:50.32]I said, okay, hey, so, like, I wonder what's in there, what kind of presents.
[464:55.08]Oh, some of them are kind of funny, some of them are crazy.
[464:57.26]I was like, oh yeah, I can't wait till the Garfield costume comes out.
[465:01.73]And he looked at me like, what are you talking about?
[465:04.05]Like, yeah, you know, the guaranteed, absolute, definite Garfield costume, I guarantee it's in there.
[465:09.57]Here's the funny story.
[465:10.39]It wasn't in there.
[465:14.29]That suggestion was not used.
[465:20.80]That was added afterwards.
[465:25.48]That was added after the fact.
[465:30.26]Because... Etalyx talked to one of my mods, a couple of them maybe, I don't know exactly who he spoke to, but they came to the conclusion that it was to be added.
[465:49.81]So that was originally not supposed to be there.
[465:56.06]I added, yeah, okay, so it was Grump.
[465:58.56]That's so funny.
[466:02.82]So originally it was not supposed to be there.
[466:06.85]But yeah, this is a little behind the scenes of the gift process.
[466:11.59]And again, I didn't really have much time to say it, but if you had a suggestion or if you were part of that process and you wanted to say, you know, give a suggestion for something fun, thank you.
[466:21.96]So many of these weird projects and weird streams
[466:27.32]A lot of it is from shit that you guys will say and write and help and it makes it a lot easier.
[466:33.18]So, thank you.
[466:37.96]Thank you to Boss Trash for the $1.
[466:40.62]I consider everyone here friends.
[466:43.12]And it means a lot.
[466:44.22]Thank you.
[466:44.84]Hashtag charity.
[466:48.26]Well, thank you, Boss Trash.
[466:49.24]I think we've got a great community here.
[466:53.42]Everyone likes to have fun.
[466:55.22]So, fuck yeah.
[467:00.31]I also added the feet exfoliation thing because I thought Kim was going to use it.
[467:05.58]Yeah, that's the... When I got home, it was just, Merry Christmas, here you go.
[467:12.08]She was like, oh, nice!
[467:16.30]So, yeah.
[467:17.40]You were right.
[467:22.02]But thank you, Boss Trash.
[467:22.94]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber, for the $1.
[467:25.69]Talking about Family Guy and the word that
[467:30.26]The Peter Award.
[467:32.24]Thank you.
[467:33.34]Whoa, I don't... Why am I drinking so much Coca-Cola?
[467:36.92]It's getting, like, in my nasal passages.
[467:39.56]Okay.
[467:41.04]Thank you, Dingastown, for the 15 bucks.
[467:43.36]Kisses, hashtag charity.
[467:45.00]Thank you.
[467:49.01]Thank you for the 15 dollars, and the hashtag charity, thank you as well.
[467:54.13]Hey Plasma Player, thanks for the $2.50, hashtag charity, listening to Earthbound and Animal Crossing soundtracks is so calming, but watching Jerma trying to keep the dog alive is too stressful.
[468:05.21]Not like this.
[468:11.51]Thank you Doubled... Thank you DoubledEleven for the one dollar.
[468:15.28]What's up Jermamites?
[468:16.82]Jerma here for another gamer giveaway.
[468:18.44]Type exclamation point.
[468:19.68]Don't do any of this.
[468:21.42]Thank you for the one dollar DoubledE.
[468:23.82]Appreciate it.
[468:24.38]Thank you HoneyChain for the three dollars.
[468:25.74]Hashtag charity.
[468:26.48]Thank you.
[468:33.12]No message?
[468:33.56]Just hashtag charity.
[468:36.36]Demonic Cucumber, again, thanks for the $2 here.
[468:39.98]They say, hey Jerma, just wanted to thank you for making me smile in this shitty month I've been having.
[468:45.04]I always smile when watching your streams.
[468:46.63]I don't know if you saw this on Discord earlier, but I made a Lego Glue Man.
[468:50.49]Alright, that's pretty cool.
[469:02.87]Lego Glue Man.
[469:09.10]I'm planning to do more.
[469:10.76]Any Rumble characters that you'd suggest?
[469:14.28]Hmm.
[469:16.10]Hashtag charity.
[469:16.72]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber.
[469:19.72]Uh, hmm.
[469:23.42]I mean, there's Mr. Snake Man, yeah.
[469:25.69]That would be a good color palette.
[469:29.09]A good outfit, I think.
[469:32.73]Mr. Snake Man sounds pretty good.
[469:35.58]But thank you for that.
[469:36.44]And also, also, you should probably do some streams with Kiwo, because she's been in chat and Discord consistently for the last couple streams, and we're gonna start corrupting her.
[469:48.37]Soon.
[469:50.09]Hashtag charity.
[469:53.63]Are you here now?
[469:54.27]Are you here now?
[469:58.25]Get in the Discord!
[469:59.06]Let's go!
[469:59.46]I'm right here!
[470:09.51]Nah, she ain't here.
[470:16.61]Uh... I've done a couple of streams.
[470:21.48]I think before.
[470:27.74]Long time ago.
[470:31.84]Keebo is nine hours ahead of Drifo.
[470:37.92]That solar system isn't accurate at all.
[470:40.74]That's...
[470:59.65]I'm imagining, I'm imagining that's the first time that you, like, you've, is that the first, is this the first time, is you just click on a random stream, like, is this the first time you've ever been here?
[471:09.47]Because that, like, that's so funny.
[471:11.78]I love it.
[471:13.20]Like, how could you not come in here and be like, this person's fucking stupid.
[471:18.26]This person has no idea how the planets work.
[471:23.60]Ugh.
[471:28.84]You would think that this person was not to be trusted with anything.
[471:43.66]The wording on that was perfect, too.
[471:45.46]Oh, man.
[471:45.94]Hey, welcome.
[471:47.08]Thanks for coming down here.
[471:52.64]Hope you enjoyed the stream.
[471:55.00]Come back tomorrow.
[471:58.41]We'll be playing more games.
[472:02.91]Uh, but anyways, uh... Like I've told you guys before... I have no rhyme or reason to... The people that I play with... Just sometimes it just organically happens.
[472:15.24]Sometimes you say, hey, Etalyx, what are you doing tomorrow?
[472:17.76]Oh, I don't know, what are you doing tomorrow?
[472:18.94]Hey, Star, what are you doing tomorrow?
[472:20.94]Hey, Vinny, what are you doing tomorrow?
[472:22.62]Oh, another match.
[472:23.14]Oh, hey, Vinny, can I, like, come, like, ruin your stream by, like, making you play Red Dead Redemption 2, but it keeps on disconnecting from me, and I, like, waste a bunch of your time?
[472:31.65]You know, like, okay, you want to, like, do something?
[472:40.49]Definitely not playing with you tomorrow, that's for sure.
[472:47.03]He has plans with me.
[472:52.61]But I don't really have any... It just happens.
[472:58.43]Sometimes you go, I wonder what they're doing.
[473:00.17]And then that person will also probably say, I wonder what they're doing.
[473:03.15]So who knows?
[473:03.95]Hey, do you want to stream with this person?
[473:07.44]Stream with her?
[473:08.58]Stream with him?
[473:09.72]I don't know.
[473:11.58]It just kind of happens.
[473:13.00]I don't really plan them.
[473:15.36]So maybe it'll be like, oh, tomorrow... No, I'm not going to even say that.
[473:27.01]But, yeah, I'm a fucking weirdo, guys, you understand?
[473:35.94]Stream with Drake?
[473:42.19]No.
[473:45.27]I just, no.
[473:46.49]I mean, what do you want me to say?
[473:55.39]This Jerma rejects a famous rapper.
[474:04.52]That's not even the, no, what I'm talking about is like, I don't, that's... If I looked at my cell phone, right?
[474:14.72]Let's just say that all huge celebrities have phone numbers that come up no matter what.
[474:20.62]You are, it'll say like, okay, my phone rings, I look over and it says Drake.
[474:25.08]Doesn't even say a phone number, just Drake.
[474:27.40]Because he's so famous, like, he just, you need to know who's calling, you know what I mean?
[474:31.10]If I looked at my cell phone tomorrow morning and I had a call and it was Drake the Rapper, like, it was Drake.
[474:38.58]Famous Drake was the name.
[474:40.32]I didn't put that in, it had to be real.
[474:43.56]How early is this?
[474:47.37]I mean, is, if it's... Is it, like, before 10 o'clock in the morning?
[474:53.10]Because I'm just going to look at my phone and I'm going to go like this.
[474:55.26]I'm going to go.
[474:58.06]Can you even see the camera?
[475:05.80]This is fun.
[475:09.27]And I'm going to go fucking back to bed.
[475:28.24]And then, four hours later... Now I'm awake, and I'm making food by the fridge.
[475:40.39]I'm afraid to answer this now, because now I fucking didn't answer the phone call the first time.
[475:45.13]And why didn't you answer my phone call earlier in the morning, when I called you earlier?
[475:49.04]I don't know, I don't know, I don't answer.
[475:53.96]Six days later, the phone rings again.
[475:58.01]Mmm.
[475:59.19]Mmm.
[476:01.79]Oh, fuck.
[476:02.79]I didn't... Oh, no.
[476:04.55]It's... It's Drake.
[476:06.65]Oh, oh my god.
[476:07.73]I forgot to call him back like six fucking days ago.
[476:10.70]And now he's gonna be angry with me.
[476:13.84]No, just don't answer it.
[476:14.72]Don't answer the phone.
[476:17.88]Another four or five days later.
[476:21.57]I call you.
[476:22.83]I call... I call Drake.
[476:25.31]Hey, dude.
[476:26.25]What's up, man?
[476:28.20]Hey, hey, what's going on?
[476:29.62]Uh, what's up?
[476:30.13]How are you?
[476:31.95]I've been pretty good, but trying to get a hold of you.
[476:33.51]Yeah, I've been real busy, you know.
[476:35.89]I've had a lot of shit going on, a lot of stuff happening, and I, you know, I've had a lot of things to do, and I haven't had the opportunity, and I'm a streamer.
[476:43.98]I can't talk on the phone during a stream.
[476:46.74]I was making a sandwich the first time he called, and I was asleep the first time he called.
[476:52.60]Making a sandwich the second time he called, and the third time he called, I was afraid to answer.
[477:01.11]That's the truth.
[477:09.77]But no, I wouldn't even... I wouldn't answer the phone.
[477:13.75]Maybe one day I would answer it.
[477:21.98]Okay, anyways.
[477:23.38]Where are we?
[477:23.78]We are here.
[477:25.82]So, I've said my piece.
[477:28.60]Sick.
[477:29.14]Okay.
[477:32.58]Uh, bonjour, thanks for the $1.
[477:34.78]The great Canadian FK club, thanks for the $15.
[477:40.00]Talked about it earlier, but thank you for the hashtag charity as well.
[477:42.76]Mostly lost, thanks for the $1.
[477:43.90]Getting close.
[477:46.16]Uh, speaking of Kiwo, she does some fantastic green screen edits in case you haven't seen them.
[477:50.69]I have.
[477:51.69]She put them all in one video.
[477:54.30]Hashtag charity.
[477:55.86]I have seen them.
[477:57.40]They're very funny.
[477:58.60]I actually, I liked on Twitter.
[478:00.62]I did a like on, I pressed the like button on Twitter.
[478:12.85]Welcome to the stream.
[478:16.48]She's done more.
[478:20.31]No.
[478:20.51]Alright, I don't... Okay, I haven't seen a couple of these.
[478:25.09]I've seen at least four of them, but there's nine minutes here.
[478:33.20]There's one with Batman here, and I don't know what it is.
[478:36.52]So, I'm going to hold on to this one.
[478:52.23]I can... This one looks kind of funny.
[478:56.07]Add it... Okay, add it to the new Movie Night playlist.
[478:58.49]Yeah.
[479:01.11]Because we're going to do an Encore Night.
[479:03.29]So, this is definitely something to add to that.
[479:14.35]Movie Night 2?
[479:14.81]Oh yeah, I confirmed a Movie Night... Not 2!
[479:18.93]Encore.
[479:21.11]Movie night epilogue.
[479:22.45]Movie night encore.
[479:25.20]Movie night one was six and a half hours.
[479:28.22]Movie night encore.
[479:29.30]Movie night colon encore will be probably like an hour and 20 minutes.
[479:34.50]Maybe like an hour.
[479:40.97]We need more footage for a movie night two.
[479:43.79]I would say that, yeah.
[479:49.00]So more like four hours.
[479:50.36]I don't know.
[479:50.92]Maybe.
[479:51.26]We'll see.
[479:53.60]But... I did see a few of them already.
[479:59.30]And they were very funny.
[480:05.60]I want to watch this one so bad right now.
[480:07.80]Welcome to the stream.
[480:09.80]My name's Jerma.
[480:10.66]Nice to meet you.
[480:11.34]Right there.
[480:11.72]Bingo!
[480:14.52]Alright, let's just watch one.
[480:15.76]We're just gonna watch one, okay?
[480:16.96]I just wanna watch one.
[480:24.30]Hey, man.
[480:25.44]Welcome to the stream.
[480:26.68]My name's Jermon.
[480:27.50]Nice to meet you.
[480:28.22]Right there, bingo!
[480:29.22]Right there, that's the follow button.
[480:30.32]If you click that, every so often you're getting notified that I'm streaming.
[480:34.58]And I do lots of fun things on this stream.
[480:37.50]Like... Uh, playing Hitman.
[480:41.26]We played that last night.
[480:42.46]That...
[480:46.45]The fucking Minecraft ad.
[480:53.04]Just one more, alright?
[480:54.12]It's like eating potato chips.
[480:55.22]You can't have one.
[480:56.70]Hold on, I need to get this off the screen.
[480:59.90]You should have acted.
[481:01.82]They're already here.
[481:04.44]The Elder Scrolls told of their return.
[481:09.71]Their defeat was merely a delay.
[481:14.89]What the fuck?
[481:15.49]What the fuck?
[481:49.90]What?
[481:51.32]Okay, no.
[481:52.06]No, no, no more.
[481:54.40]You can only watch one more.
[481:56.46]Alright, last one.
[481:58.38]Absolutely terrible.
[482:19.62]You know the closer you get to them where you become a
[482:44.77]Oh my god.
[482:45.09]Ugh.
[483:16.50]The spycraft!
[483:18.14]That was perfect!
[483:20.28]Oh man, that was funny.
[483:27.52]God.
[483:28.40]Okay, that was it.
[483:29.78]We gotta save him.
[483:35.17]We gotta save them for encore night.
[483:38.65]One more?
[483:39.07]You gotta do one more!
[483:40.31]Alright, that's it.
[483:43.38]Underwear
[484:16.36]Wait a minute, hold on.
[484:18.10]When I did that cartwheel, my dislike underwear comes up.
[484:22.01]Oh shit!
[484:23.71]Wow, okay.
[484:36.13]Oh, god damn it.
[484:48.02]Mom, I see it!
[484:51.42]I saw that one.
[484:52.58]I didn't see this one.
[485:20.04]I'm not even in the right direction.
[485:28.12]Oh, man.
[485:28.78]Alright, I'm gonna eat the whole bag of chips.
[485:38.95]I can't.
[485:39.33]I'm already halfway through the bag.
[485:41.77]You know when you look down at the bag of family-sized Doritos and you're like, wow, I just bought these and I just opened them 20 minutes ago?
[485:50.81]No!
[485:51.35]Okay, we're done.
[485:55.54]I gotta crinkle up the bag and put him in the closet.
[486:02.44]No, no, we gotta save these.
[486:03.64]We gotta save them.
[486:04.65]They're too good to not... Come on.
[486:07.95]Encore Knight.
[486:11.11]Alright, I have a chip in my mouth, though, so I have to finish this one.
[486:31.75]Oh no!
[487:08.93]I saw this one.
[487:46.66]Oh god.
[488:31.01]Oh, I hate that clip.
[488:32.21]It's my least favorite one.
[488:45.53]In the water.
[488:46.29]Water.
[488:49.92]Fire.
[488:57.01]And long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.
[489:03.31]Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
[489:06.40]What is this?
[489:10.26]Is this Digimon?
[489:15.22]Oh, yeah.
[489:31.78]What the fuck is that?
[489:51.89]Wow.
[489:52.71]This is crazy.
[489:53.33]That's cool.
[489:53.77]That was awesome.
[490:18.45]Oh, I finished the whole bag.
[490:20.76]God damn it.
[490:21.12]No, we're going to watch this again.
[490:22.48]I shouldn't have eaten the whole fucking bag.
[490:24.42]Unbelievable.
[490:25.76]Oh, shit.
[490:25.96]Whatever.
[490:49.40]Anyways, that was awesome.
[490:56.00]Those are very, very good.
[491:06.07]That was nine minutes of... I've had to play, like, outro music playing for almost all of them, too.
[491:12.91]We're going to watch those again on the true encore night.
[491:18.79]You want a link?
[491:19.39]Absolutely.
[491:27.31]Uh, Kiwo, if you're watching this, or if you get wind of this stream, uh, that was great.
[491:36.74]Now hop in the Discord!
[491:37.94]Oh, hey, what's this?
[491:40.47]GTA night!
[491:41.81]Oh, watch out, watch out!
[491:43.65]Whoa, you just hit that guy!
[492:00.07]So, let's finish the bits.
[492:02.33]So, when is the Encore Movie Night?
[492:05.13]Now, that is a tale for another day.
[492:08.42]After the New Year.
[492:13.94]Let's think about this.
[492:15.58]That could be a... Snap of the fingers there.
[492:18.49]That could be... Excuse me.
[492:24.19]What do you want to do on New Year's Eve?
[492:32.32]That sounds like a pretty good night for an encore.
[492:43.76]Possible.
[492:46.68]That's very close.
[492:47.62]It's only what?
[492:48.62]One, two, three.
[492:49.26]That's only about four days from now.
[492:51.94]That's like not even three full days.
[492:54.56]So... We'll see.
[492:59.83]Might want to wait till after the new year, but... We'll see.
[493:03.39]I'm not going to guarantee you anything.
[493:08.87]But, should be a lot of fun.
[493:10.80]Thank you again, Kiwo.
[493:11.60]Those were fucking hilarious.

[494:18.02]No auto-saving.
[494:19.20]And Fallout New Vegas.
[494:20.86]Frequent crashing.
[494:22.33]You need to get way better at saving your game.
[494:24.63]Before and after buying and selling and before risky moves always, Jeremy.
[494:30.69]I know.
[494:33.25]You know, you're talking to a boomer here.
[494:37.98]I remember the days of no saving.
[494:40.04]Where you didn't get to save the game.
[494:42.06]You just lost.
[494:44.36]And had to do it all over again.
[494:48.13]I'm not admitting anything.
[494:49.15]That's just what you guys call me.
[494:50.45]As like a fun thing to call me.
[495:02.48]Fun.
[495:02.74]Yeah, it's like a fun thing that you... It's like our thing here.
[495:06.26]You know, it's our thing that we have here.
[495:07.76]Let's keep going.
[495:19.13]Rampaging Scrub, thank you for the five community subs.
[495:21.83]Thank you so much.
[495:23.65]Very generous of you.
[495:26.46]We talked about it before, but thank you.
[495:30.46]Gonderlane, thanks for the $1.
[495:31.60]While suggesting stuff for the Amazon presence, I found this.
[495:33.76]700 games.
[495:40.40]Sorry, that page does not work.
[495:41.90]The link no longer works.
[495:44.59]But apparently it's a 700 games version.
[495:50.68]700 games.
[495:51.60]By Viva Media.
[495:58.12]700,000 games, version 2.0.
[496:03.19]Would you look at that?
[496:07.31]Hmm.
[496:09.85]Interesting.
[496:11.47]I wonder how many of these are just the same game.
[496:13.18]$10.
[496:15.40]Amazon Primeable.
[496:20.38]Okay.
[496:22.20]Well, I know what we're doing at some point.
[496:25.28]Works on Windows 10.
[496:26.88]700,000 games.
[496:27.22]I'm going to... Yeah.
[496:33.13]We've got to play the part.
[496:34.09]We're going to play part two.
[496:37.33]One customer review.
[496:38.17]It's one star.
[496:40.33]Doesn't work in Windows 10.
[496:42.53]Well, I'll get it to work.
[496:48.91]That's 1.4 million games in total.
[496:53.41]Thank you.
[496:54.93]Yeah, even if it didn't go through the Christmas Eve stream, I feel like it'd make for a long-awaited stream sequel to the original video.
[497:02.32]That sounds fun.
[497:03.84]I think we'll do that.
[497:05.70]Some point in the new year.
[497:08.63]Definitely.
[497:09.65]Early.
[497:10.61]Somewhere in January.
[497:13.90]Hey, thank you PugNinja for the $1 Jerma Nosebite Hashtag Charity.

[498:30.99]That's coming up.
[498:31.83]I have to be here.
[498:33.57]I have to be streaming, and I'm going to be in, like, hockey equipment.
[498:44.86]People think that's a joke.
[498:47.28]I am going to be in like a football uniform.
[498:50.44]I'm going to be in like full goalie gear.
[498:52.74]And I'm going to sit here with like fucking the pillows of surrounding me.
[498:59.70]And I'm going to sit here and just scream until that's over.
[499:10.05]But, yes.
[499:11.91]I am aware of this.
[499:13.05]Okay, I'm not even kidding.
[499:14.53]On January 23rd, I'm gonna, like, Final Destination movie my house.
[499:20.41]That's true.
[499:21.11]I agree.
[499:22.02]Serious.
[499:23.12]I just fucked myself.
[499:24.86]I'm gonna board up the windows.
[499:26.52]I'm gonna only drink green juice from now until January 23rd, 2019.
[499:29.20]I didn't do that.
[499:29.84]I've had a lot.
[499:30.22]Oh, no.
[499:30.44]Oh, no.
[499:30.70]Oh, no.
[499:41.01]Oh well.
[499:46.87]Well.
[499:47.95]I'll see you on the 23rd.
[499:49.73]And it has to be the 23rd too.
[499:51.61]Like the day of evil.
[499:55.06]Doesn't the 20- Didn't Jim Carrey make a movie about that number and how it's evil?
[499:59.42]Ugh.
[500:06.15]Uh, thank you, Rag Arnoy, for the $4.
[500:09.71]Any possibility of playing Metal Gear Rising?
[500:12.08]What's the canon on you losing to Pinwheel?
[500:14.32]I still think you lost, honestly.
[500:15.60]Hashtag charity.
[500:16.98]The canon is I won.
[500:18.50]First try.
[500:21.36]It was very, very, very hard for me.
[500:25.25]First try.
[500:27.47]Uh, Metal Gear Rising, I keep... People really want me to play that game.
[500:34.29]Is Metal Gear Rising that good of a game to stream?
[500:37.23]Is it like a good game that you would want to see on stream?
[500:44.43]Should I beat Metal Gear Rising on stream?
[500:47.99]That's essentially what I'm asking.
[500:58.71]Yes.
[500:59.79]Probably.
[501:00.21]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[501:01.67]Really.
[501:03.85]Okay.
[501:04.81]You don't beat any games on stream.
[501:08.89]Uh, well, I'm sorry that I have news for you.
[501:13.82]I've got some news for you.
[501:15.56]Let's go ahead and just take a quick little look back here at the backlog.
[501:23.11]and um I'm just kind of having what's happening what's happening why am I talking and um that was weird uh but I'm really really sorry to say this uh but less than two weeks ago I not only did I start but I completed Hotline Miami and Hotline Miami 2.
[501:48.54]Some of the hardest video games that have been released.
[501:51.85]And I beat both of them last week.
[501:54.99]That was last week?
[501:55.63]I did that last week?
[502:08.09]I cleaned up the... I was the janitor.
[502:10.37]I cleaned up the house.
[502:15.75]I built the birdhouse.
[502:16.65]That was a completion.
[502:20.53]Hitman 2.
[502:21.81]I beat Hitman- I completed Hitman 2.
[502:24.47]That was a few weeks ago.
[502:26.00]That was like a month or two months ago.
[502:31.07]I didn't complete Red Dead 2 because there's a very, very specific reason for that.
[502:35.83]I streamed Red Dead for about 30 to 40% of the campaign and I was like, you know, I love this game.
[502:41.20]I love Rockstar.
[502:42.00]I love it.
[502:42.52]I wanted just to kind of sit there quiet with my mouth open on my couch and complete it.
[502:47.90]You know what I mean?
[502:49.02]Completed Labo.
[502:50.94]Completed all the Labos.
[502:52.10]All of them.
[502:59.04]Beat Jevil first try.
[503:03.74]Alright, we're almost done with the bits.
[503:05.22]Let's go.
[503:09.86]But maybe I will play Metal Gear Rising.
[503:12.26]Put it on the list.
[503:13.64]Flustered Flamingo, thanks for the $1.
[503:15.10]Jerma, this Christmas season has honestly been quite stressful for me.
[503:17.96]Just want to ask how you stay motivated.
[503:19.80]Hashtag charity.
[503:23.64]Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[503:24.78]Sorry to hear it's been a stressful time.
[503:26.55]Holidays can do that.
[503:29.11]I would say best way to stay motivated is to try try to challenge yourself because you give yourself something that if it takes it's gonna take a lot of work might take some time
[503:51.23]But that's how I do it.
[503:52.17]I stay motivated by trying to challenge myself.
[503:56.03]And doesn't just mean in like work or streams, just in general.
[504:08.13]It's a tricky thing though.
[504:19.10]Try to beat Hotline Miami 2 on stream.
[504:23.18]Doesn't matter what you're talking about.
[504:30.85]But motivation can be very difficult.
[504:34.71]And I get unmotivated sometimes.
[504:36.13]It's hard.
[504:36.87]Sometimes it takes a lot to stay focused on something.
[504:44.26]Did he like Kenshi?
[504:45.50]Oh, he loved it.
[504:46.36]He loved Kenshi.
[504:58.08]Sadly?
[504:58.78]What?
[505:01.12]What do you mean, sadly?
[505:03.92]Sadly.
[505:04.86]Oh, no.
[505:05.58]Oh, great.
[505:06.02]He likes it.
[505:10.72]Thank you, C4G, for the $2.
[505:12.66]Please explain the +2, -2 meme to me.
[505:16.00]I have a small brain.
[505:16.94]I don't get it.
[505:18.81]Well, it's a meme that was killed, that was banned forever.
[505:23.97]If you weren't here a few years ago, a couple years ago, back in 2017, I deleted, I banned forever all the old memes from the channel.
[505:33.47]If you said them, then you were going to get timed out.
[505:36.11]And there was a revolt.
[505:40.27]Then there was a revive stream, and then there was... There was a little... One of them got to live, and of course it's like the cryptocurrency one.
[505:47.80]That's like just laughing in my face.
[505:50.42]Of course the one meme that got to stay.
[505:52.96]The whole bald coin crypto thing.
[505:55.06]Oh, that kind of... Well, laugh it in my face now, ain't it?
[506:01.15]Whoa!
[506:03.03]Whoa!
[506:05.31]What the fuck was that?
[506:13.17]But anyways, it means it's me getting points and losing points for saying something that people thought was either really unfunny or that they thought was funny.
[506:25.04]And sometimes people use it even when I'm not attempting to make a joke.
[506:27.54]Sometimes I'll say, I had like fucking cornflakes for breakfast today and I'll see minus twos in the chat.
[506:32.56]And it's just like, I just told you what I had for breakfast.
[506:40.21]And it originally comes...
[506:44.80]Way further back, when me and Etalyx played Kane and Lynch, right?
[506:51.87]And we had to beat the whole game in four hours.
[506:54.95]And if we had a funny joke, we got extra time.
[506:57.53]That was a fucking joke.
[506:59.11]Well, that was a disaster, but that was one of my favorite streams ever.
[507:05.75]Me and Etalyx were actually desperately looking around for another co-op game that's less than five to six hours.
[507:11.66]They're very hard to find to do that again.
[507:23.08]We actually did do it, yeah, after all the bullshit.
[507:30.23]It was minus 30 minutes from nudity, yeah.
[507:33.43]And there was a shitload of nudity.
[507:39.47]But that's kind of the whole story there, you know.
[507:42.65]You know, TL;DR fashion.
[507:44.37]Thank you for the $10 shoe shroom, and I'm really, really sorry to hear that.
[508:05.89]Any companion, any animal, any pet, any friend... That's always incredibly hard to do.
[508:14.76]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[508:20.16]Thank you for the $10.
[508:20.98]Thanks for sticking around.
[508:25.59]And speaking of birds... I was actually...
[508:31.76]Sometimes when I go to the pet store to get Otto's food, I see some of those birds that they have in the pet stores.
[508:44.69]They look like a lot of fun.
[508:45.97]They do.
[508:50.92]There was one big parrot that was at a local pet store.
[508:58.20]And this thing seems so smart and so funny and interesting.
[509:06.43]So I can imagine how much fun they are and how incredibly hard it is for you right now.
[509:10.98]Shroom, so.
[509:14.30]Thank you so much for the $10.
[509:18.04]I wish you the best.
[509:18.70]Thank you.
[509:22.16]Don't get a big parrot for your first one.
[509:24.13]Well, no, I wouldn't do that unless I knew exactly what I was doing and I don't have the time or the resources to be able to take care of a bird like that, that big.
[509:33.71]But they seem really, really interesting.
[509:37.18]Thank you, Ittrus, for the one dollar.
[509:39.10]No message, thank you.
[509:41.78]Double D, thanks for the one dollar.
[509:42.96]Speaking of suggestions for streams, you should build a huge LEGO set on stream.

[509:51.15]Oh, just replace two of those letters.
[509:54.93]Add an A. And then a B. You know.

[510:11.64]Cooking stream.
[510:12.38]When?
[510:15.10]Um... I don't... I... I don't know.
[510:19.34]I'd want that to be elaborate.
[510:22.26]I don't want to just put up a webcam in the kitchen and just say, This is me.
[510:25.99]This is me cooking.
[510:27.57]Um... This is, uh... Tuna.
[510:31.97]Tuna fish.
[510:32.53]This is, um... I just make a pancake.
[510:35.77]By hour and ten minutes.
[510:37.15]See ya.
[510:39.16]I'm not, no, I don't want to do that.
[510:43.67]I would want to hire like two professional chefs to come and do like a cooking thing with like two real actual professionals to teach you the three of us.
[511:00.71]While I, yeah, while I watch them.
[511:04.74]And like get in their way and shit and like be really annoying taking food out of one of the bowls.
[511:11.42]Putting my hands in like the shredded cheese like, mmm this is kinda good.
[511:22.87]Don't have the money for a bird.
[511:24.43]Hey guys, check out my friend Gordon Ramsay.
[511:26.49]No, I didn't say money.
[511:27.43]I said time or resources.
[511:29.93]Resources doesn't always have to be money.
[511:37.39]Resources can mean a lot of different things.
[511:52.09]Resources can mean space to have a bird, that's right.
[511:55.63]Resources can mean who can take care of the bird.
[512:03.54]Because let's put it this way, right?
[512:04.56]If I was up here for eight hours, what if the bird got out of the cage?
[512:10.17]You know what I mean?
[512:12.83]Just flying around.
[512:13.61]And you've got to get a huge, huge cage, right?
[512:33.19]That would take up a lot of room that we just don't really have.
[512:39.21]But they're damn cool.
[512:43.44]But anyways, thank you to Ike Turtle for the $1.
[512:45.64]Fell asleep during one of the mining jokes.
[512:48.32]I don't know which one, though, because there were so many.
[512:50.74]I woke up and I had a dollar in bits, so here you go.
[512:53.06]Thanks for being you, Jerma Expensive.

[513:17.72]What's this?
[513:18.48]Okay.

[514:11.59]You never fail to give me a laugh at the stream highlights.
[514:14.13]Looking forward to another great year of streams.
[514:17.19]Also, I'm not Jerma complimenting himself.
[514:20.29]I'm a real person.

[514:25.15]That's true.
[514:26.84]That is not me.
[514:30.92]Uh, thank you.
[514:33.70]Don't worry about not catching streams.
[514:35.18]You don't have to feel obligated to be here.
[514:38.95]If you have time and you want to hang out, absolutely.
[514:43.75]I'd be glad to have you.
[514:46.03]But thank you for the $5.
[514:49.10]And I'm not a chatbot.
[514:54.18]Hey, the great Canadian...
[514:58.99]FK Club?
[514:59.78]Why am I not saying that word?
[515:01.28]I say that word a hundred times a stream.
[515:05.72]Because it's actually written out like that.
[515:07.72]That's why.
[515:10.64]Finish the bag.
[515:11.53]Hashtag charity.
[515:12.33]That was during Kiwo's green screen video compilation.
[515:22.59]Thank you for the $50.
[515:23.03]Great, Canadian.
[515:28.72]Great Canadian.

[517:20.77]What people in the industry could I ever get to show up to that?
[517:34.22]Thank you, Fitty, for the $50.
[517:35.40]Another $50.
[517:35.86]$50.
[517:35.88]5,000 bit donation here.
[517:36.30]Thank you, Fitty.
[517:44.26]Awesome.
[517:44.73]Thank you.
[517:45.09]I was actually talking this morning in the Discord about EU stuff.
[518:04.71]And it's just, I would love to have more streams available for people in EU.
[518:09.58]So you don't have to stay up so late.
[518:12.26]But then, like nearly, almost 80% of the whole audience is in North America.
[518:19.74]So catering to the North American audience.
[518:21.62]And if you, you know, if I do streams that cater to EU, then everybody that wants to watch in North America might not be available.
[518:28.81]It's just, it's a balancing act.
[518:35.03]So, it is hard to do.
[518:39.19]But, it is a thing.
[518:45.20]Can you name your next Kenshi squadmate after me?
[518:50.68]Uh... No, me.
[518:57.92]No, uh... Maybe.
[519:00.50]Maybe.
[519:00.88]Maybe.
[519:07.40]That was such a quick... Maybe.
[519:11.73]That was a beater.
[519:13.31]It was.
[519:13.93]I'll count that.
[519:15.37]Even if it wasn't even close to being the same word.
[519:21.78]I will give you that one.
[519:24.54]But, thank you to Fitty.
[519:26.38]Thank you Double D for the $1.
[519:27.40]Hey Jerma, just letting you know that Drake was in the chat the entire time.
[519:30.44]Now he's crying himself to sleep and he's going to write a song about you.
[519:32.98]Look what you've done.
[519:33.68]All you have to do is stream with him.
[519:34.82]Hashtag charity.
[519:36.44]Oh, I look forward to what the song is.
[519:41.32]And, uh, Kirby.
[519:42.44]Apparently Kirby had their bits eaten.
[519:46.04]A few times.
[519:47.66]But, uh, let's see.
[519:48.68]It's a YouTube link.
[519:53.79]It's a gnome link.
[519:55.11]It's a gnome link.
[519:55.75]Okay.
[519:56.13]Well, that was a lot of... And I got it.
[520:02.78]And this time, it's not going to be flayed again.
[520:10.97]Well, thank you, Kirby.
[520:13.99]Now, before we go, I'm going to play the credits down in the corner here.
[520:22.65]Actually, I need a different thing here, or... Are you going to do this to me?
[520:28.40]Come on.
[520:29.38]We're going to play the 12 Days of Christmas video while the credits run in the corner.
[520:37.89]And I would really love if I...
[520:42.71]Could get the credits.
[520:45.03]But a lot of things were changed.
[520:46.39]By the way, if you didn't know, this whole computer went to the studio.
[520:51.38]I had to tear down my whole setup and put it back together again.
[520:53.88]Let's see.
[520:56.06]I've got to get the right widget here.
[520:58.81]Okay.
[520:58.97]There it is.
[521:01.75]Move this out of the way.
[521:06.19]Okay.
[521:12.20]Okay, so the credits are gonna roll.
[521:18.60]And we will open that video.
[521:22.00]So, thank you everybody for your subscriptions.
[521:31.13]There are a shitload of you guys now.
[521:34.55]So many people are subscribed to this channel.
[521:37.33]Thank you.
[521:38.81]And let's watch the video.
[521:46.36]And I had it open in a tab, but I desperately panicked and clicked out of two gnome videos.
[521:52.93]So I don't have it anymore.
[521:54.75]So let me go get it.
[521:55.91]Here it is.
[522:00.99]Put this up here.
[522:01.73]Alright, let's watch it.
[522:19.65]No.
[522:31.80]On the first day of germs, my streamer gave to me a breakdown life on stream.
[522:38.47]Life is pain!
[522:40.01]I hate it!
[522:40.53]That's great.
[522:41.67]On the second day of germs, my streamer gave to me a breakdown life on stream.
[522:49.04]Where am I?
[522:49.94]I beat that game.
[522:51.68]On the third day of germs, my streamer gave to me three ball coins.
[522:58.08]Two rat monkeys and a breakdown line ball stream.
[523:03.66]On the fourth day of germs, this my streamer gave to me.
[523:08.02]Four level keys, three ball coins.
[523:12.12]Two rat monkeys and a breakdown line ball stream.
[523:16.74]On the fifth day of germs, this my streamer gave to me.
[523:21.50]Five feet in height.
[523:28.32]All advocates scream, all the boys too, and we celebrate our own history.
[523:36.60]I have to see that like nine more times.
[524:04.62]Alright!
[524:04.90]I'm just gonna sit on it.
[524:08.79]What was that?
[524:35.75]What was that like milk?
[524:36.79]That's not five feet tall.
[525:01.87]What the fuck is it doing?
[525:03.52]What are you doing?
[525:04.58]Look at that short ass hair.
[525:31.68]How many times have I done the comb?
[525:33.54]I thought I did like two times.
[525:57.51]Shut up.
[525:59.03]Shut this fucking music off.
[526:00.52]Holy shit.
[526:01.00]What was that?
[526:02.00]Wait, hold on.
[526:03.04]What was that?
[526:03.80]You all know what the story is on it.
[526:05.30]I don't even have to explain it.
[526:37.71]Well, thank you for that.
[526:38.91]That was... That was... What?
[526:41.35]A lot of work went into that.
[526:47.78]That was really, really funny.
[526:48.78]Thank you so much for that.
[526:53.05]Gotta show the credits, you know, I've got, of course.
[526:57.19]But you know who made it?
[527:06.39]Thank you so much.
[527:12.06]That was the 12 days of Christmas.
[527:16.28]I don't remember half of those things happening.
[527:17.70]What was the thing where like I got smashed and my car exploded?
[527:21.84]I don't even know what that was, but Marty20k gave out 12 community subs.
[527:27.68]Marty20k is the person who uploaded that video.
[527:32.27]So, thank you.
[527:36.73]Thank you so much, Marty20k.
[527:41.29]Great work.
[527:44.86]And thank you for the huge amount of community subs as well.
[527:51.27]It was Road Redemption?
[527:54.59]Oh my god, I forgot about that game.
[527:58.19]But that is going to take us to the end.
[528:03.07]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[528:04.49]Let's just make sure that I didn't miss anybody.
[528:06.97]I don't think I did.
[528:09.40]Unless somebody came in right now, which... No, that's it.
[528:17.00]I'll see you guys tomorrow around 2 or 3 o'clock p.m.
[528:20.40]Pacific Time.
[528:22.73]More Kenshi.
[528:28.41]See you soon.
[528:29.71]Have a great one.
[528:32.07]Take care of yourselves.
[528:33.93]Good night.
[528:35.23]I'm sorry that was so loud.
[528:38.14]I had to... Okay, I fucked it up.
[528:39.92]Whatever.
[528:40.22]Good night.
[528:56.16]Thank you.
