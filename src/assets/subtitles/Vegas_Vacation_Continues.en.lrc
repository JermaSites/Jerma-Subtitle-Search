[04:00.08]I'm sure it'll be there soon.
[04:02.92]Kill Easy Pete.
[04:05.49]Am I going to kill Easy Pete yet?
[04:09.09]Not yet.
[04:10.37]Maybe.
[04:14.58]It's your main video, but not listed.
[04:17.22]Should have been.
[04:17.60]Yeah, I publiced it.
[04:28.16]Alright.
[04:30.20]Let's switch over here.
[04:33.39]Just waiting for some trickling in of people.
[04:40.97]My stomach is making noise, too.
[04:42.75]I ate, too.
[04:43.35]I ate.
[04:43.75]I shouldn't be doing this.
[04:53.97]No, I ate, too.
[04:55.36]Oh, look.
[04:56.72]Look who it is.
[04:58.50]It's this asshole.
[05:02.82]Yeah, I don't know.
[05:03.26]My stomach is like rumbling like crazy for some reason.
[05:06.02]I don't know why.
[05:07.17]I ate earlier.
[05:09.37]I don't know.
[05:09.93]Sometimes I guess you just... Your stomach decides to make noise.
[05:13.19]I was going to have this be here the whole time.
[05:16.95]You see my printer?
[05:18.35]I'm working on something back there.
[05:20.13]I'm working on something secret.
[05:21.71]You can't fucking know what it is.
[05:26.67]Hmm.
[05:29.77]Get this Boston thug out of my classy stream.
[05:35.98]Yeah, I am a thug.
[05:36.72]What are you going to do?
[05:40.38]You want me to do a dinner stream one of these days?
[05:43.19]Maybe I'll just eat food on stream.
[05:44.67]That would be kind of funny.
[05:45.51]Sigh.
[05:55.27]Let's open the game.
[06:01.52]No, I'm still kind of over here, aren't I?
[06:03.32]Oh, hold on.
[06:06.02]Hold on.
[06:07.48]Oh, shit.
[06:09.14]Stop it.
[06:11.20]Get out of the way.
[06:14.59]Which side should this be on?
[06:16.33]Like over here?
[06:16.83]It's going to be tiny.
[06:21.59]It's going to be just so small in the corner.
[06:27.24]No facecam.
[06:29.02]Whoa.
[06:29.66]Holy shit.
[06:30.30]Arcade E. Arcade.
[06:32.47]Arcade.
[06:32.91]Welcome, dude.
[06:33.87]Thank you so much.
[06:45.94]yeah uh the reason why I don't do face cams I'll give you the real reason why it's because for like highlights and for recording purposes like I'm recording all these I don't want like a facecam in the corner I really don't it'll pop in from time to time but it just in case I want to like cut a video up or have um kalem it might put something together from I just don't want it in the corner
[07:13.68]Plus, it allows me to, like, rip the boogers out of my nose and eat them.
[07:21.28]That was gross.
[07:21.98]That's not what I'm going to do.
[07:23.58]That's not what I'm going to do.
[07:28.53]I promise.
[07:30.13]Alright, let's get started.
[07:32.05]Enough people have come in, I believe.
[07:34.13]I have no idea what the hell I was just doing.
[07:38.91]I want to check one more thing.
[07:39.85]I just want to make sure the video is actually going through.
[07:42.57]I guess it is.
[07:44.34]Yeah, it is.
[07:45.16]Okay.
[07:46.22]Okay.
[07:47.64]Okay.
[07:48.44]Sweet, sweet boogers.
[07:50.14]What the hell was I doing?
[07:52.50]All I remember from last stream is we ended on a really, really, really weird note.
[07:57.82]I don't even know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing at the moment, but we're sure we're gonna find out, right, guys?
[08:05.84]Quests.
[08:07.86]Come fly with me.
[08:08.71]Head to the Repcon facility west of Novak to investigate rumors of ghouls.
[08:12.69]Okay, yeah, I remember.
[08:13.41]I have to go find that guy and kill the ghouls.
[08:22.83]Where is my power fist?
[08:25.06]I want that on.
[08:27.56]This thing is badass.
[08:31.32]Who can I buy things from here?
[08:33.18]I'm not exactly sure.
[08:36.99]But we will find him.
[08:39.22]We will.
[08:39.76]Is it like a medic or something?
[08:49.86]Kill Easy Pete.
[08:50.74]Everyone so badly wants me to kill Easy Pete.
[08:53.16]You know, I might just like teleport to kill Easy Pete just so we stop seeing that in chat.
[09:01.37]You know what I'm saying?
[09:05.71]Howdy.
[09:06.07]Hey, the merch.
[09:07.12]Welcome.
[09:09.32]I killed the dude who sells... Oh, that's right, I did.
[09:11.14]That's right.
[09:11.70]Okay.
[09:12.72]I did kill the guy that sells stuff.
[09:14.50]My bad.
[09:16.52]I'll just go to... I'll fast travel to... Where was it?
[09:25.34]Prim, right?
[09:26.22]Did I kill anybody here?
[09:27.16]Am I allowed to come here?
[09:30.73]Wait, that's an unarmed weapon?
[09:32.43]Are you serious?
[09:35.04]Are you shitting me?
[09:41.96]I don't remember where anything is.
[09:45.28]But I think the guy was in here.
[09:51.73]You can resurrect people by clicking on them and typing resurrect.
[09:54.43]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[10:02.14]Is this guy still naked?
[10:03.54]Hey there.
[10:05.36]This dude still doesn't have any clothes on.
[10:07.98]It's been at least a couple days.
[10:09.36]Where are your clothes, dude?
[10:11.76]Oh, where's the guy that runs the place?
[10:18.04]No.
[10:23.55]Where is he?
[10:26.53]He's walking around with a gun.
[10:27.39]That's all I remember.
[10:27.97]And I called him a raisin.
[10:29.51]I hear you aim to bring rule of law back to our town.
[10:32.13]God knows we need the help.
[10:33.03]Howdy.
[10:34.00]Wait, wait, wait.
[10:40.02]Hold on.
[10:43.04]Hey, there you are.
[10:46.10]Ster.
[10:49.70]Ster just subscribed.
[10:52.07]S-T-U-H-R-E.
[10:54.63]Welcome.
[10:55.27]Thank you.
[10:58.37]I only do third person when I'm walking around.
[11:02.27]Do you have anything I can buy?
[11:03.89]And will you buy these from me?
[11:06.47]Will he take the, uh... I wonder.
[11:18.78]Can I not sell the... Miscellaneous.
[11:25.46]Come on.
[11:28.96]What am I supposed to do with the 200 dinosaurs I have?
[11:37.95]Okay, here we go.
[11:40.19]I only have 73 of them?
[11:45.42]What about the other ones that I had?
[11:54.66]I had like 200 of the other ones.
[11:55.80]Maybe I just threw them on the ground.
[11:59.56]What Spider-Man game was that?
[12:02.24]That was Spider-Man 2.
[12:03.10]The amazing Spider-Man 2.
[12:08.18]Stimpak, you have any... Just take out... Just get out of here.
[12:12.52]Pleasure doing business with you.
[12:13.84]I'm gonna go kill some ghouls.
[12:18.11]Time for me to go.
[12:18.73]Goodbye.
[12:22.53]Only 73 of those weren't stolen.
[12:26.09]I didn't buy 73 of them.
[12:28.45]I did not buy them.
[12:33.75]Okay.
[12:34.61]Let's go... I'm gonna go...
[12:43.38]Spider-Man 2 is greater than Amazing Spider-Man 2.
[12:48.36]I wouldn't really know.
[12:50.72]I have not seen any of the Amazing Spider-Man series.
[12:53.88]None of them.
[12:58.63]Well, I don't have... How many Stimpaks do I have?
[13:02.81]Six?
[13:03.21]That's okay.
[13:03.75]Let's go Power Fist some motherfuckers.
[13:11.55]What do you say?
[13:14.68]I would subscribe, but I ain't got no money.
[13:16.14]Sorry, Jerma.
[13:16.70]You don't have to subscribe, man.
[13:18.00]There's no... That's not a requirement to watch the stream.
[13:23.34]Just hang out.
[13:25.94]So I gotta go this way.
[13:27.64]Yeah.
[13:33.86]Defeat Pete.
[13:36.86]I'm telling you, next time I see Pete, I'm punching him right in the face.
[13:43.29]Have I ever played the old Spider-Man 2 game on GameCube PS2?
[13:45.71]That game is the best superhero game, just for your information.
[13:49.96]I'm sure it is.
[13:50.68]Although they've made so many Spider-Man games at this point, I don't have no idea which ones are even fun.
[13:58.07]There's like six.
[14:03.97]That guy looks dangerous.
[14:07.92]I am the raddest girl, little honey.
[14:10.84]I will kill you just for... Just for him!
[14:16.56]Whoa!

[14:44.22]I wonder if Twitch will approve it.
[14:45.46]I guess it's up there.
[14:59.21]Maybe I can just keep going this way.
[15:08.95]Investigate the ghouls.
[15:13.30]I will find you.
[15:14.62]Oh, don't step in the shit.
[15:15.40]Don't step in the ghoul shit.
[15:19.23]That's a club.
[15:19.75]Gonna have to take a look at that club a little closer.
[15:31.42]okay so I was just told is the power fist a melee weapon or is this a melee weapon is this classified as an unarmed or should I be using the this one I'm not sure it's pika yay oh sorry I thought it was an l my eyesight is terrible I apologize
[15:56.65]Just the words game sucks.
[15:57.85]Yeah, it was just gonna be like game sucks.
[15:59.78]Like game and then underneath that sucks.
[16:03.60]It's unarmed.
[16:04.08]Okay, so I'm putting the club on.
[16:09.72]Whoa!
[16:20.08]Azure the hero.
[16:22.30]Azure the hero.
[16:22.96]Thank you.
[16:23.44]Welcome.
[16:24.34]Thank you so much.
[16:25.68]Thank you for subbing on this game, which sucks.
[16:28.32]Game sucks.
[16:35.78]They're all empty.
[16:40.05]So this is nine strength.
[16:41.71]I don't think I have nine strength.
[16:42.81]Is that going to be a problem?
[16:44.51]Is that going to be an issue?
[16:48.61]Yeah.
[16:52.07]Could be an issue.
[16:52.65]Okay, I gotta go in the facility.
[16:58.64]Enter the facility and find the source of the ghouls.
[17:01.12]Is that water?
[17:04.06]Nah.
[17:11.17]This is a Dark Souls weapon.
[17:17.57]I'm going the right way, right?
[17:19.41]I think so.
[17:22.16]You'll do damage to yourself if you try to hit someone.
[17:26.00]What?
[17:28.24]That's a lot of fucking ghouls.
[17:29.36]Uh-oh.
[17:36.59]Here comes the Final Fantasy music.
[17:44.37]Oh, fuck.
[17:49.31]You guys thought that was gonna be a problem?
[17:51.92]It was easy.
[17:57.68]Rev up those death counters?
[17:58.93]I'm not... No.
[18:02.55]Don't rev up any death counters.
[18:08.85]Did you see that shit?
[18:11.80]Did you see that shit?
[18:13.52]Man.
[18:14.60]That was a lot.
[18:15.42]That was a lot.
[18:17.66]Got him.
[18:19.26]Got him, got him, got him, got him.
[18:23.39]Never fear, Nordic is here.
[18:24.61]What's going on, Nordic?
[18:25.43]How you doing?
[18:35.18]Fuck, this place sucks.
[18:38.06]Recharger rifle.
[18:38.92]This thing looks cool.
[18:40.04]How much is away?
[18:40.58]15 points?
[18:41.64]Let's see if I can carry it.
[18:46.73]Oh, shit.
[18:47.43]I gotta throw some stuff down.
[18:49.31]I have so much junk.
[19:00.23]Let's see.
[19:01.61]Medium, light.
[19:11.06]Maintain.
[19:11.68]I don't know.
[19:18.75]Did I get her enough to move?
[19:20.11]I did.
[19:20.33]You don't need ammo.
[19:23.39]The recharger.
[19:23.97]That's good.
[19:25.43]That works for me.
[19:28.44]A lot of good loot in this area?
[19:29.36]Well, I'll have to explore then, won't I?
[19:30.93]Let's go in.
[19:43.79]I feel like I'm going to do this.
[19:45.31]Because even with the flashlight, I feel like it's still a little dark.
[19:49.23]Display brightness.
[19:50.71]Let's just turn it up a little bit.
[19:54.03]See if that's better.
[19:54.63]That's a little better.
[19:55.28]One more, maybe.
[19:55.72]Maybe.
[20:02.22]Mmm.
[20:03.62]No, it's a little too washed out for me.
[20:06.74]Bring it down.
[20:07.22]There we go.
[20:07.64]Alright, bring it in.
[20:14.69]Bring it in.
[20:20.53]This thing is pretty nice.
[20:21.59]I'm much enjoying this.
[20:24.58]Let me get another roundhouse.
[20:26.58]That is so fucking awesome.
[20:28.22]That is so good.
[20:30.18]I'm gonna do that to every single enemy.
[20:35.78]Why would you not do this to every enemy and insta-kill them?
[20:42.52]Oh, dead bodies.
[20:46.84]Energy cell.
[20:47.40]Plasma pistol.
[20:48.14]Psycho.
[20:48.46]I don't have enough... I don't have enough space for any of this shit.
[20:59.53]I'll give it a try.
[21:00.11]People want me to try the rifle.
[21:03.23]Recharger rifle.
[21:04.01]Let's try it.
[21:13.99]Okay, this thing's fucking crazy.
[21:15.05]This thing's amazing.
[21:19.93]The only thing is I'm not... I'm terrible in guns.
[21:22.19]Okay.
[21:42.33]Okay.
[21:43.27]Hey.
[21:44.87]Whoa.
[21:45.97]Holy shit, it's Gul'dan from Warcraft.
[21:50.86]He's completely missed.
[21:54.16]Two in the face.
[21:55.60]And he exploded.
[21:56.42]Shit, what do I do with this orc?
[22:09.11]Come on!
[22:10.33]Come on!
[22:11.73]Please!
[22:12.37]The rifle's kind of cool, but I don't know.
[22:22.80]Why would I be using this when I have the giant piece of rubble?
[22:28.95]And I can upgrade it.
[22:37.84]Or repair it, whatever.
[22:40.20]Get this thing back on.
[22:41.38]Fuck everything else.
[22:45.33]Ugh, for the love of God.
[22:47.51]Well, alright.
[22:48.79]DildoSaurus wrecked.
[22:51.01]698, welcome.
[22:51.51]Thank you for subscribing, DildoSaurus.
[23:09.33]Welcome to the family.
[23:10.09]This thing's worth a lot of money.
[23:16.03]Which is worth nothing that I'm just going to throw on the ground.
[23:19.74]Let's just get rid of that.
[23:20.70]I don't want any of this junk.
[23:22.30]It's junk.
[23:22.82]That gun, it's good.
[23:24.28]Throwing spear.
[23:27.08]Get rid of the tire irons.
[23:28.06]I don't want them.
[23:28.98]The Vermont rifle.
[23:30.08]I don't want the Vermont rifle anymore.
[23:31.68]Okay, I'm back at 209.
[23:40.60]I'm hearing things.
[23:43.64]Uh, hello?
[23:52.24]Lord, death.
[23:52.98]Kill anything.
[23:53.56]Kill 200 enemies.
[23:54.56]Okay.
[23:55.10]So, what does this guy want me to do?
[23:56.98]You want me to go up the stairs?
[23:59.32]I can do that.
[24:04.19]It is so dark.
[24:05.35]Wait!
[24:06.05]What?! !
[24:07.52]Hey, Kusty15.
[24:10.88]Kusty15, thanks a lot.
[24:12.13]Welcome back, man.
[24:12.95]Appreciate it.
[24:14.71]I hope every day is a good day for you.
[24:16.45]You know, if you're having a bad day today, guys, let's just take a second here.
[24:21.75]Shit, are you going through some shit?
[24:23.29]I said this on StarStream like a couple weeks ago.
[24:26.21]You ain't alone, okay?
[24:28.35]Everybody goes through shit.
[24:29.83]I'm going through some shit right now.
[24:31.23]Shit sucks.
[24:32.55]But, you know, sometimes shit just sucks.
[24:36.36]Then you're not alone.
[24:37.95]Have a good day.
[24:38.61]Have a good night.
[24:40.13]We all have our problems.
[24:43.17]I fucking love you all to death.
[24:47.29]People are texting me right now.
[24:53.44]Absolutely.
[24:57.75]Now we're gonna trash this vacuum cleaner.
[25:04.84]Whoa!
[25:06.05]Hello.
[25:06.43]Don't ever fuckin' underestimate the spin move.
[25:14.07]We're gonna spin move everybody.
[25:15.78]Anybody in here?
[25:16.34]Hello!
[25:17.54]Oh, you're dead.
[25:24.93]No.
[25:25.43]Not any of this crap.
[25:34.16]Great moves.
[25:34.76]Keep it up.
[25:35.92]I am the raddest girl, little honey.
[25:38.84]I will kill you just for... Just for him!
[25:44.55]Whoa!
[25:45.67]Depressed Bear.
[25:47.03]Just subscribe.
[25:47.67]Depressed Bear.
[25:48.45]This is exactly what I was talking about.
[25:50.61]Don't be depressed.
[25:53.89]Take every day, every step at a time, Depressed Bear.
[25:56.25]Thank you so much for subscribing.
[25:59.32]I have radiation poisoning, though.
[26:00.95]Doesn't that mean I have to drive to take something?
[26:03.57]How do I get my rads down?
[26:11.15]What did I just do?
[26:13.23]Did I use that?
[26:17.01]Addiction removal.
[26:19.85]I guess I'm just using these.
[26:22.06]Beer, blood pack.
[26:23.12]Do I have anything?
[26:25.74]Rads plus nine.
[26:29.21]I don't have any rad away, no.
[26:31.79]Well, I'm just going to have to be dying on the inside from this, apparently.
[26:37.78]Don't let a single goddamn ghoul live.
[26:39.54]I'm on it.
[26:40.38]That's what my plan is, man.
[26:46.10]Wait, did I have radx?
[26:46.92]I have medx.
[26:50.17]Oh, I do.
[26:50.59]Yeah, okay.
[26:53.19]Wait, what?
[26:55.77]Okay.
[27:01.63]I shouldn't have taken that.
[27:02.83]Oopsie daisy.
[27:09.82]Ah, blood.
[27:10.74]Take a picture of it.
[27:16.22]Radix doesn't get rid- This is blind!
[27:18.06]I played Fallout 3 like fucking two years ago.
[27:21.54]Give me a break.
[27:26.64]Not all of us are fucking supermen when it comes to this game.
[27:31.14]You see these steaks?
[27:36.64]Junk food.
[27:37.28]I'm not going to eat all this anyways.
[27:44.55]Okay.
[27:50.55]Where did he go?
[27:50.95]He said go upstairs, right?
[27:51.95]Is this somewhere I haven't gone?
[27:58.08]I don't know.
[27:59.72]I'll try opening this.
[28:05.87]Ooh.
[28:08.81]A whole lot of shit that I don't want.
[28:10.62]I don't want any of this crap.
[28:15.80]Oh, good.
[28:17.54]Nothing in here.
[28:18.40]Nothing at all.
[28:18.92]I'm not going to do any crafting or anything, guys.
[28:23.67]I'm literally just going to walk around with the heaviest weapon I can find.
[28:28.69]Tell us about the secret video.
[28:33.47]Then it wouldn't be a secret anymore, now would it?
[28:39.11]play Minecraft with me?
[28:42.66]I don't think I'm gonna do that.
[28:51.50]Whoa, I hear shit.
[28:58.18]Another one?
[28:58.52]Where's the other one?
[29:04.04]Baseball glove, cool!
[29:09.59]Alright, activate the computer.
[29:10.53]Alright, I got it.
[29:20.08]Nice.
[29:30.60]So why am I such a scrub for playing in third person?
[29:32.77]People were saying that before.
[29:35.29]Third person, fuck you!
[29:37.75]Third person!
[29:43.66]Where?
[29:50.12]This is such a fucking scary game right now.
[30:02.01]There he is.
[30:09.65]Do I have an iFunny account?
[30:11.21]No, I don't.
[30:12.53]I don't know what that is.
[30:20.83]See ya.
[30:29.33]I got a feeling that's where I'm supposed to go.
[30:35.63]If I would be a betting man, I would bet on that.
[30:42.58]I have not played through this game before, ever.
[30:46.42]This is a blind first time in New Vegas.
[30:53.36]What?
[30:54.38]Oh, he's down the stairs.
[30:55.14]I'm gonna queue up a swing.
[30:57.12]I'm gonna baseball swing this guy's fucking head off.
[30:59.08]Watch this one.
[31:02.93]Oh, that would've been awesome if it wasn't his arm.
[31:08.65]Another one?
[31:09.05]Is that it?
[31:13.62]Okay.
[31:19.50]Hydra.
[31:24.72]Did you see the super blue mutant corpse on the ground?
[31:26.76]I did.
[31:29.32]I did see that.
[31:30.07]Wasn't I supposed to come in here and kill all these things?
[31:47.13]God, but are you ugly.
[31:49.65]Hey.
[31:49.83]Get upstairs and talk to Jason.
[31:53.55]I'm so glad that cut this guy off.
[31:56.02]Just for him!
[32:01.06]Whoa!
[32:02.42]Super Craig Thloptastic.
[32:05.96]Thanks for stopping.
[32:08.26]Welcome.
[32:10.06]Welcome to the family.
[32:11.69]Enjoy your solar system.
[32:14.52]Okay, is this guy's not a ghoul?
[32:15.64]Your pranks won't work on me, smooth skin.
[32:18.80]They won't work on Jason either.
[32:20.78]Well, you look pretty smooth.
[32:23.33]Stop wasting my time, smooth skin.
[32:26.81]Go waste Jason's.
[32:36.33]Fuck you, I came here for a mission.
[32:38.86]And I'm gonna do my mission.
[32:41.06]You fucking ghouls.
[32:42.32]Damn.
[32:46.29]What?
[32:49.85]Wait, what?
[32:50.85]The quest failed.
[32:52.51]What are you talking about?
[33:05.12]What?
[33:09.20]What?
[33:10.86]I don't get it.
[33:11.26]I was supposed to come in here and kill these things.
[33:13.06]That was my mission.
[33:14.38]Sprocket, thank you for subscribing.
[33:15.66]Welcome.
[33:18.15]Easy game, easy game.
[33:21.29]Was that a mistake?
[33:21.97]Oh, I've made plenty of those before.
[33:25.75]So if I kill all these guys, it's going to complete the quest for the other one, right?
[33:37.10]No!
[33:40.40]Holy shit, they have so many.
[33:52.67]Give me a fucking give me his lightsaber Who's left I can't find anything who's talking
[34:30.24]Where'd he go?
[34:35.24]That's too bad.
[34:43.09]That's too bad.
[34:44.09]You monster.
[34:44.83]What?
[34:45.15]These guys have... That guy talked a lot of shit.
[34:47.57]Alright.
[34:50.53]Give me at least a little bit of credit.
[35:04.47]Alright, hold on, let me look at this again.
[35:05.79]Whoa!
[35:09.43]Oh my god, that's two subs back to back.
[35:13.84]Just for him!
[35:30.83]JFSL1996 and Throomond.
[35:36.29]Welcome to both of you guys.
[35:39.23]Thanks so much for subbing, guys.
[35:40.20]I really appreciate it.
[35:42.04]Hope you enjoy the stream.
[36:00.89]Who's left?
[36:01.33]Is this subway?
[36:06.21]Holy shit.
[36:08.83]Fuck.
[36:11.31]Come here, you.
[36:19.70]Fancy snacks?
[36:30.49]Go back?
[36:31.01]What do you mean go back?
[36:35.61]I needed to come up here and help that guy Vargas.
[36:44.93]I fucked up the mission.
[36:45.89]I fucked up the mission.
[36:47.45]Oh, did I?
[36:47.91]Because I see this guy right here and he's all glowy.
[36:51.15]Hello, wanderer.
[36:52.59]Please forgive us our humble surroundings.
[36:54.77]Our true home awaits us in the far beyond.
[36:57.70]Have you come to help us complete the great journey?
[37:01.55]Who's that guy?
[37:08.01]You're referring to Chris.
[37:09.99]I doubt you had much luck if you tried telling him that he's human.
[37:13.75]We had the same discussions when he first appeared and the same lack of success.
[37:19.90]Right.
[37:20.24]This guy knows I killed everybody in here.
[37:21.88]Soon enough we realized that Chris was a gift from the creator.
[37:26.18]He is integral to the success of the great journey.
[37:33.51]I am Jason Bright.
[37:34.39]He's a prophet, huh?
[37:35.41]The prophet of the great journey.
[37:38.57]All the ghouls you see here are members of my flock.
[37:41.28]Finish the job.
[37:42.78]Finish the job.
[37:47.02]I don't care.
[37:49.56]You're a dead man anyways.
[37:52.52]I have glimpsed it only in visions, Wanderer, but what I have seen is truly miraculous.
[37:58.02]Send him to the great beyond.
[37:59.29]It is a place of light and healing.
[38:03.79]Okay.
[38:06.21]I'll take care of the demons for you.
[38:07.81]Praise the creator.
[38:09.83]As soon as the underground has been... Yeah.
[38:13.21]Alright.
[38:14.45]Let me take care of those demons for you.
[38:24.28]See?
[38:24.56]I'm fine.
[38:27.10]I'm fine.
[38:27.76]Everyone was freaking out for no reason.
[38:29.52]I'm good.
[38:33.02]Jerva is the demon.
[38:41.95]Oh, what the fuck?
[38:43.05]So, like, the quest is just broken.
[38:48.35]She ran away.
[38:57.12]Gilded?
[38:57.70]What was his name?
[38:59.96]Gilded Porkchop.
[39:02.38]Welcome.
[39:04.78]So should I just fucking kill this guy?
[39:08.30]You got it.
[39:11.00]I missed.
[39:13.84]Don't move, sir.
[39:15.86]I was just playing with you.
[39:17.22]I just didn't want you to know that this was coming for you.
[39:27.01]You can run, but you can't hide.
[39:35.68]It didn't have anything.
[39:36.54]This guy didn't have anything on him.
[39:43.25]R.I.P.
[39:44.17]Novak.
[39:52.25]You monster.
[39:55.52]What's in the box?
[39:56.20]Alright, well, that's all in a day's work.
[40:09.26]Where's the loot?
[40:12.00]Alright, I'll load it.
[40:12.78]I'll do it.
[40:13.88]I'll load it.
[40:14.46]Hold on.
[40:14.96]Oh, nope.
[40:17.19]Never mind.
[40:17.63]I don't know where this is going to bring me.
[40:21.69]Let's find out.
[40:25.23]Oh, okay.
[40:25.55]See, we're fine.
[40:28.70]I fucking have to kill him.
[40:35.10]I have to kill this guy.
[40:39.66]God, I just need to bury this into his head.
[40:42.42]I can't help it.
[40:43.34]I have to.
[40:47.62]Morning.
[40:49.86]Fine, let's go.
[41:02.35]I'll take care of the demons.
[41:04.07]Wait, what?
[41:11.66]Okay, I need to go down, right?
[41:14.44]Downtown?
[41:16.88]Get rid of the Nightkin in the basement.
[41:29.21]Master Gurr.
[41:31.65]Master Gurr, welcome.
[41:32.79]Thanks a lot, man.
[41:34.54]Thank you for subscribing.
[41:37.38]So where is the basement?
[41:39.20]I'm assuming down, right?
[41:44.64]Basement.
[41:45.22]Okay.
[41:53.41]Destroy him.
[41:55.41]I did.
[41:56.71]I'm curious to see what's... I came all the way down here.
[41:58.65]It would be a pretty stupid idea to just let it waste itself.
[42:03.36]Repcon basement.
[42:04.10]So, okay.
[42:11.86]Is this the right way?
[42:15.45]Hold on a second.
[42:20.23]Where am I?
[42:20.55]Right here?
[42:28.29]This is a room that I've never seen before.
[42:31.19]Guy coming.
[42:33.65]Here comes a guy.
[42:35.96]Here comes a guy.
[42:41.51]I am the raddest girl, little honey.
[42:44.43]I will kill you just for, just for help.
[42:49.92]Beef Craig juice.
[42:52.80]There's a lot of subs tonight.
[42:55.30]You guys are subbing like crazy.
[42:56.82]Thank you so much.
[42:57.36]I appreciate it.
[42:58.00]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[43:01.54]No, it's back this way.
[43:07.70]No, it's this way.
[43:09.58]Nope.
[43:11.07]Can I get there through here?
[43:17.83]I believe so.
[43:19.01]Yes.
[43:21.08]Let's go.
[43:27.88]Hey, a Nuka-Cola.
[43:29.22]Those are good.
[43:29.78]Those give you energy, don't they?
[43:38.13]Is it here?
[43:42.84]Getting lost in this place.
[43:44.07]Yeah, it shouldn't have been just like right fucking there.
[43:56.35]I'm gonna break this fucking door.
[44:02.17]Whoa!
[44:05.43]Corton!
[44:07.22]Thank you, Corton.
[44:10.00]Much appreciated, dude.
[44:11.04]Welcome.
[44:15.80]Like, I'm kind of just going in circles, but I don't know, like, I don't know where the fuck this is.
[44:23.77]It should be, like, right here, shouldn't it?
[44:27.07]I mean, I need to be on, like, the ground floor, but, like, what the fuck?
[44:33.84]It doesn't seem to be a way.
[44:36.90]It doesn't seem to be a way, guys.
[44:38.22]There's no way to get there.
[44:41.32]Just walking around in fucking circles.
[44:45.90]Is this it?
[44:47.60]Come on, basement.
[44:50.18]Just break the fucking door down!
[44:55.20]I can't open any doors!
[45:00.60]Seriously.
[45:01.26]How am I supposed to know what level I'm even on, or what level this is on?
[45:04.92]Is this the basement?
[45:14.43]Goddamn.
[45:17.95]God.
[45:18.79]Game.
[45:20.19]Sucks.
[45:20.53]Let me heal up a little bit first.
[45:30.34]Oh.
[45:30.74]Drink a Nuka-Cola.
[45:32.78]And we'll have a Pear Fruit.
[45:33.92]Damn.
[45:35.90]Whoa!
[45:46.86]Vagrant... What was your name?
[45:52.62]VagrantHunter22.
[45:53.18]Thanks a lot, man.
[45:56.18]Actually, probably better if I just do this.
[45:58.14]I'm gonna just do this to make sure I don't miss any other ones.
[46:02.01]My alert box.
[46:04.73]There it is.
[46:05.15]There we are.
[46:15.59]Okie dokie.
[46:18.81]I should not miss any more subs.
[46:19.99]I wouldn't have to lower down.
[46:21.85]Alright, let's go.
[46:23.35]Save.
[46:24.39]Let's get in it.
[46:25.19]Let's step in that asshole, Larry.
[46:28.03]Step inside that asshole, Larry.
[46:29.71]What do you say?
[46:34.01]I gotta kill demons down here, right?
[46:35.80]Easy.
[46:37.20]They call me the fucking Demon Slayer from where I am.
[46:48.64]What the fuck?
[46:54.00]Oh god.
[46:54.54]Why are they fucking invisible?
[47:02.72]Invisible demon people?
[47:12.09]Can I do this?
[47:13.33]Am I actually going to be able to do this?
[47:19.88]Is it possible?
[47:28.22]Where is he?
[47:32.87]Where is he?
[47:34.17]I don't know where he is.
[47:34.85]Okay, there he is.
[47:44.81]Do you want to go?
[47:46.54]VAT system!
[47:50.17]I got him.
[47:51.53]Except he's not even hurt.
[47:52.41]Just don't call your friend.
[48:05.96]Come on, crit him!
[48:07.03]Why do I have all this luck if I'm not gonna crit one fucking time?
[48:09.41]Boom!
[48:14.43]There it is.
[48:15.89]Dead.
[48:22.05]Okay, that was actually better, wasn't it?
[48:23.81]33, 34.
[48:25.47]No.
[48:25.57]Oh.
[48:25.77]Do you remember the type of guy that would look up walkthroughs on a game as soon as he gets stuck?
[48:42.36]What?
[48:43.70]What gave you that idea?
[48:44.44]There's another one.
[48:48.62]I'm going to heal up.
[48:53.09]I'm gonna take some psycho.
[48:58.51]Alright, let's do... Oh, fuck.
[49:00.09]I'm addicted to drugs.
[49:04.38]Oh, great.
[49:04.78]I'm addicted to drugs.
[49:07.30]Am I addicted to psycho?
[49:10.98]Alright, where is he?
[49:11.46]Where is he?
[49:11.70]Come on.
[49:13.70]Come on.
[49:15.79]Where the fuck is he?
[49:17.11]What?
[49:17.39]There he is.
[49:21.60]Get psycho'd.
[49:24.57]Punk.
[49:28.73]Alright, let me repair that again.
[49:32.81]Get this thing up to full health.
[49:37.98]First time addict, baby.
[49:41.72]We are addicted to drugs.
[49:46.93]I'll go this way.
[50:00.00]Hey, repair items in your inventory.
[50:01.20]I got an achievement.
[50:01.86]Cool.
[50:03.10]Can't open the door, because I'm too much of a shithole to open it.
[50:12.30]Okay, this guy looks different.
[50:14.23]What's that, Antler?
[50:15.59]We have a visitor?
[50:17.17]An assassin, more like.
[50:18.63]I say kill it, Antler.
[50:20.03]For safe's sake.
[50:21.65]Hmm?
[50:22.71]Okay, Antler.
[50:23.61]I'll ask.
[50:25.75]Uh, hi, human.
[50:27.33]Why you come here?
[50:32.22]Uh, I'm here on behalf of the ghouls.
[50:34.18]A human who is friend to ghouls?
[50:36.88]Suspicious.
[50:38.58]You mean the ones upstairs?
[50:40.72]Antler used intercom.
[50:42.22]Told them stay put.
[50:43.64]But they want to come down in basement anyways.
[50:46.48]Yes, we do.
[50:47.28]We want to kill you.
[50:48.70]My kin are not right in head like I am.
[50:52.14]What is he wearing on his face?
[50:54.08]Ghouls too.
[50:55.16]They crazy.
[50:57.30]Your ghoul friends have to wait until you find
[51:01.57]Um.
[51:04.40]Do I kill him?
[51:06.92]I don't know.
[51:07.18]I kind of like that this guy's cooler than the ghouls.
[51:08.86]That stupid glowing green Nickelodeon gack guy upstairs.
[51:13.43]I don't think I fucking like him.
[51:17.82]Why can't you search the last room?
[51:44.51]Okay.
[51:44.61]I'll kill him.
[51:45.47]Mm-hmm.
[51:45.73]Wait, you're telling me I can get the sword on his back?
[51:50.47]Are you kidding me?
[51:51.19]Hold on.
[51:52.03]I can get the sword on this guy's back.
[51:55.82]I just want to be really, really clear about this.
[51:59.52]This sword can be equipped by me...
[52:14.71]within the next five minutes.
[52:16.57]Is that true?
[52:21.15]Just want to make sure.
[52:21.88]If that's true, then this guy's dead.
[52:26.44]You know what I'm saying?
[52:29.94]Get the sword.
[52:32.92]Do it.
[52:34.02]It's not a unique weapon.
[52:35.90]Yes, you can.
[52:38.00]That's a pipe.
[52:38.88]It's not... Wait, there's not a sword?
[52:41.14]There's not like a big cloud stri... Yes, there is!
[52:44.16]There's a sword!
[52:44.93]Okay, I'll find the stealth boy.
[52:50.11]Alright, let's get that sword.
[52:52.25]It is a sword!
[52:53.47]That thing is so cool.
[52:54.19]It's got a license plate on it.
[52:56.45]Are you serious?
[53:06.72]Oh, I'm going to kick this guy's ass.
[53:10.82]Getting that sword, no matter what.
[53:12.18]Okay, where am I going here?
[53:19.31]This way?
[53:22.93]Or which way?
[53:23.97]This way, right?
[53:26.92]I'm just looking here.
[53:30.78]It's a bumper sticker.
[53:35.58]Do the quest, then kill him.
[53:37.78]That's not a bad idea.
[53:39.82]You might be onto something there.
[53:43.50]Let's do it.
[53:46.98]Save the game.
[53:47.58]This guy's a Simpsons character.
[53:59.74]And I bet he told you it's the Creator's will for you to risk your ass instead of him, right?
[54:04.46]There's too many people.
[54:05.34]Well, good luck with that.
[54:07.82]I'd give you a hand, but no thanks.
[54:10.81]I may look like a corpse, but I'm partial to living.
[54:15.71]There's like three different entities down here.
[54:19.43]It's like Ghoul Batman, Ecto Gak Guy upstairs, and then the Bondage Dude in the other room.
[54:26.61]Who do I want to be friends with?
[54:28.49]What a decision.
[54:34.22]Guess the outfit gives that away, huh?
[54:35.92]Entities.
[54:36.48]I never did buy into that religious mumbo jumbo with the robes and all that shit.
[54:40.38]Yeah, there's all kinds of entities down there.
[54:41.56]Gets lonely out in the wastes, okay?
[54:44.11]And I don't have to tell you.
[54:45.65]Pineapple face.
[54:47.37]This guy has a pineapple.
[54:50.47]I would have to tell you.
[54:52.07]Anyway, I helped them out.

[55:35.04]You can be my friend.

[61:45.16]What am I doing again?
[61:45.94]I was going to take this off.
[61:50.28]I was going to put this on.
[61:51.37]I can't fucking believe that shit.
[61:57.77]You would have been done by now if you just did the quest.
[61:59.71]That's probably true.
[62:01.57]As funny as that is.
[62:05.42]And we're going to put the cowboy hat on.
[62:06.69]And... 226.
[62:11.85]Get rid of some of this junk.
[62:19.39]Viagra fruit got to Jerma.

[62:25.02]Yeah.
[62:27.20]Give me some slack, man.
[62:31.97]I'm never going to leave the basement.
[62:32.89]I'm never going to get out of the basement.
[62:34.01]I'm going to be stuck here forever.
[62:38.94]Easy.
[62:39.52]Easy.
[62:40.10]Easy, cowboy.
[62:41.38]Easy, cowboy.
[62:44.96]You move so quickly in this game, too.
[62:46.52]That's another thing.
[62:48.58]You go so fast.
[62:50.72]Like, I'm already running so quickly.
[62:53.13]Alright, quests.
[62:58.29]Search the nearby room for the stealth boy shipment.
[63:03.15]So I need a stealth boy shipment.
[63:06.25]I guess it has to be down here.
[63:09.22]Right?
[63:12.52]I'm so scared of everything right now.
[63:20.02]Ugh.
[63:21.22]Giant roaches.
[63:22.46]I am the raddest girl, little honey.
[63:26.23]I will kill you just for... Just for him!
[63:32.59]Boofoo Kirby.
[63:35.47]Thank you.
[63:35.83]Welcome.
[63:38.79]Thank you, Boofoo Kirby.
[63:48.39]I want nothing to do with these.
[63:49.27]I don't care.
[63:50.31]Just give me the shipment.
[63:52.56]Get me the hell out of here.
[63:57.12]Get under there.
[63:57.66]Come on.
[63:57.88]Come on, cowboy.
[63:58.86]Come on, cowboy.
[64:08.72]Where's my marker?
[64:09.36]It's over here.
[64:14.85]So it's up and around.
[64:16.03]Okay.
[64:17.25]You got it.
[64:19.17]Oh, wait.
[64:19.89]Slow down.
[64:21.65]Bombs.
[64:23.15]Oh, my God.
[64:23.67]I hate that.
[64:25.07]I hate that I have to remember that.
[64:33.74]No.
[64:35.32]Okay, shipment mistake.
[64:36.38]Shipment sent back.
[64:39.55]Sending back to... Okay.
[64:43.03]Return to Davidson with the news that the Stealth Boys are not in their facility.
[64:47.57]Okay.
[64:49.80]Everybody, I got it.
[64:50.76]I got it.
[64:51.10]Chill out.
[64:51.56]I'm good.
[64:52.08]I'm fine.
[64:54.14]Let's go talk to that guy again.
[65:01.25]I almost just stepped into mine again.
[65:03.21]You see that?
[65:04.11]That was really close.
[65:04.97]Let's go back.
[65:14.66]Play Skyrim next.
[65:17.48]I already did.
[65:18.28]You saw my Skyrim video, didn't you?
[65:19.78]It was a fucking mess.
[65:23.08]I already beat the fuck out of that game.
[65:25.92]Hey, guess what?
[65:26.84]There's no Stealth Boys.
[65:28.01]Sorry, man.
[65:32.13]Liar!
[65:32.91]The invoice said Stealth Boys here.
[65:35.21]Antler read it out loud to me.
[65:38.17]Uh, sorry.
[65:39.31]Not true.
[65:39.69]But invoice note said Stealth Boys were here.
[65:42.31]Why can't that note be true?
[65:44.55]What, Antler?
[65:45.65]But human could be lying.
[65:47.65]Stealing the Stealth Boys for itself.
[65:49.37]This is where my charisma's gonna come into play.
[65:50.94]Oh, Antler, you trust so easy.
[65:53.30]You're lucky day, human.
[65:55.02]Antler believe you.
[65:56.22]Niken will follow the new note to find Stealth Boys.
[65:59.48]Better be there.
[66:02.26]Okay.
[66:02.66]Return dues.
[66:04.82]Get rid of the Niken.
[66:05.62]The basement.
[66:06.02]Report to Jason Bright that the Niken are gone.
[66:13.86]I want that sword so bad.
[66:17.40]But we'll go complete the quest.
[66:20.48]I don't want to fight him.
[66:21.58]I'm assuming I could go get him, right?
[66:25.28]Again?
[66:25.58]Later?
[66:26.98]Get the sword.
[66:27.42]Take him.
[66:28.34]Alright, we're getting the sword.
[66:32.11]We're a good-natured stream, don't you know?
[66:36.53]That was the plan.
[66:37.29]The plan was to kill him.
[66:40.31]Thankfully, these guys aren't hostile.
[66:41.40]Where did he go?
[66:45.98]Is he sleeping?
[66:51.24]The guy was asleep.
[66:52.18]It's just a dead body.
[66:53.00]Why would his stealth be activated still?
[66:55.04]It doesn't make any sense.
[67:00.57]He's leaving.
[67:01.17]Oh, he's gone.
[67:01.75]Oh, fuck it.
[67:03.79]I can get a sword somewhere else.
[67:05.19]Another day.
[67:05.65]Another day, another dollar.
[67:10.29]Let's just get the hell out of here.
[67:14.91]Or... Actually, wait a minute.
[67:17.43]Might as well take all their stuff and then eat it.
[67:22.77]They're a dime a dozen later on.
[67:23.99]That's fine then.
[67:24.71]I don't care.
[67:26.23]Let's take the Viagra fruit.
[67:28.63]We need a bunch of junk food and
[67:32.22]Drink one of these.
[67:35.36]Drink some whiskey.
[67:37.32]Eat some horseradish.
[67:41.72]Drink a couple of wines.
[67:44.83]Alright, let's go.
[67:45.35]Okay, where is the exit?
[67:59.52]Fucking way over there.
[68:02.98]I hate these corridors, man.
[68:04.52]Too many corridors.
[68:05.12]That was the best sword in the game.
[68:08.54]It was unique.
[68:10.78]There's no purple letters in this game.
[68:13.42]Whoa.
[68:14.14]Quimgee!
[68:15.40]Thank you.
[68:16.18]Welcome.
[68:27.91]Thank you for subscribing.
[68:28.81]It means a lot.
[68:31.16]All of you guys.
[68:31.60]It means a fucking lot.
[68:36.80]Where was Jason again?
[68:42.13]This way?
[68:48.13]Jason.
[68:48.81]Oh, Jason.
[68:51.23]Jason.
[68:57.17]The labs there.
[69:02.47]Bethesda makes the best identical hallway games.
[69:05.09]I have to keep going around them the other way?
[69:24.04]Oh, I can go that way, can't I?
[69:25.43]Everything's the same in my brain here.
[69:28.65]I hate these areas.
[69:29.65]Everything's identical to me.
[69:53.61]Okay.
[70:01.22]To be honest, this is the worst area in the game.
[70:03.10]Is it?
[70:04.34]Why do you say that?
[70:12.03]Hey, you.
[70:12.41]I did something for you.
[70:16.25]That's a dick.
[70:20.95]Remind me to kill that guy on the way out.
[70:25.03]Okay, where's Jason?
[70:26.21]Jason.
[70:28.53]Jason.
[70:32.03]You motherfucker, Jason.
[70:33.77]I'm losing patience here.
[70:38.79]I'm about to start killing acolytes.
[70:40.39]There he is.
[70:46.69]Yep, they're gone.
[70:51.82]Kill that guy on the way out.
[70:54.42]He's a creep.
[70:55.12]Whoa, whoa!
[70:56.24]They're all running!
[70:57.72]Let's go!
[70:58.04]Why is my video playing?
[71:19.07]God who said we I didn't see what happens here.
[71:23.02]I just caused a civil war Whoa, I think I just caused a civil war Dr.. Sniffles and Dante three What's up the astronauts?
[71:34.95]Look at this fucking astronaut Where'd they go?
[71:45.63]Where the fuck think where are you guys?
[71:48.23]Yeah, that's a double sub.
[71:49.09]Thanks a lot, guys.
[71:50.11]Welcome.
[71:51.29]Where's the inevitable war that's going to happen down here?
[71:53.37]Are you serious?
[72:00.64]Head to the basement and talk to Jason Bright about what comes next.
[72:03.30]So, what the fuck?
[72:09.47]I mean, is it just down here?
[72:16.74]I'm very confused right now.
[72:19.02]Don't they typically just run around?
[72:21.44]And you can follow them and shit?
[72:29.75]Am I going the right way?
[72:30.59]Where the fuck am I going?
[72:38.13]Where am I going?
[72:38.65]Am I going the right way?
[72:40.69]I think so.
[72:46.91]I think I am.
[72:47.39]Wait.
[72:50.01]There's something in this door.
[72:52.17]I have no skills.
[72:59.94]I can't use it.
[73:00.64]I'm not skilled enough.
[73:05.29]You're going the right way good.
[73:07.17]That's good to know.
[73:09.27]I'm doing something right.
[73:10.19]There it is.
[73:11.98]I waited to speak with you one last time before I descended to the launch pad, Wanderer.
[73:16.96]I want you to know that we will remember for all eternity how you delivered us to the threshold of the great journey.
[73:23.39]Uh huh.
[73:23.59]Sure, tell me your whole life story, please.
[73:25.09]Okay.
[73:51.13]We wish to escape the barbarity of the wasteland.
[73:55.45]So what are they going to fly in a rocket?
[73:57.05]Is that what's going to happen?
[73:59.88]Yeah.
[74:00.04]Oh, shit.
[74:00.28]No, wow.
[74:00.52]Three months, dude.
[74:01.56]Welcome back.
[74:02.20]You enjoying my shitty run of Fall of New Vegas?
[74:04.61]I hope so.
[74:05.43]This guy's just preaching to me.
[74:07.09]I don't care at all.
[74:30.16]Uh, goodbye, Jason.
[74:33.10]I could honestly care less about anything you just told me.
[74:36.88]Jason says that I am to cooperate with you on the final tasks necessary to launch the great journey.
[74:42.23]Are these guys all gonna just fly into space?
[74:44.49]Is that what's gonna happen?
[74:50.79]I'm the Phlox resident engineer.
[74:52.86]I've always been good with machines.
[74:54.46]You could play a match three game and I'd be here.
[74:57.90]Fucking match three game?
[75:00.04]Of course, my skills aren't much use unless I have the right materials.
[75:03.54]Wait, that's not Peggle.
[75:05.56]Bejeweled.
[75:06.72]I think Bejeweled is what we were looking for there.
[75:09.42]Thanks, dude.
[75:11.35]It's cool to have you here.
[75:13.41]Thanks for staying sub for three months.
[75:15.03]That's fucking awesome.
[75:16.09]Thank you.
[75:20.66]What can I do?
[75:24.38]Just, you know, give me the fucking condensed version.
[75:33.01]Okay.
[75:33.47]Five rocket.
[75:34.21]Whoa!
[75:37.47]I did it.
[75:37.75]I win.
[75:39.36]Okay, I'm gonna go.
[75:53.00]So I gave him rockets?
[75:55.02]Find parts to fix the rocket's thrust controllers.
[76:02.29]Actually, I think I do need to talk to this guy.
[76:04.35]I still had rockets.
[76:05.29]Okay, so can you give me any tips on my current scavengers?
[76:12.50]Junk dealers?
[76:19.86]Obviously.
[76:21.18]It's taken months.
[76:22.90]I was skeptical at first.
[76:24.22]Alright, um... Ooh!
[76:32.09]See?
[76:34.01]I got a marker.
[76:34.57]Ooh!
[76:35.84]Look at that.
[76:39.22]47 out of 50 speeds.
[76:40.76]You wouldn't trust a ghoul, now would you?
[76:42.16]I failed.
[76:42.88]Okay, bye.
[76:47.67]Seriously, I don't even know what I need.
[76:49.33]Find atomic fuel for the rocket.
[76:50.81]Speak to Chris about fixing the rocket.
[76:52.79]Atomic fuel?
[76:55.23]Where am I going to get atomic fuel?
[76:58.71]I killed the junk dealer?
[77:02.47]Did I really?
[77:02.89]Yeah, I think I killed the guy that was down here.
[77:10.64]Well, that's unfortunate.
[77:17.23]Anything else I can do down here?
[77:24.52]Oh, a stimpak.
[77:26.38]I will gladly take stimpaks.
[77:29.10]Worst gamer ever.
[77:38.47]Oh, look at this.
[77:39.15]I want to do that.
[77:42.57]Can I use the intercom and yell at him?
[77:50.97]Ooh, there's a marker.
[77:55.19]I guess I can go that way.
[77:56.03]So I should just go back to Novak and just walk straight up then, huh?
[78:03.74]That makes sense to me.
[78:07.56]There's a space chute on the shelf?
[78:11.55]Ooh!
[78:17.73]Hey, no, excuse me.
[78:18.71]No backseating, guys.
[78:19.83]Don't fucking backseat me.
[78:21.13]Come on.
[78:25.57]No backseating allowed.
[78:29.72]Spacesuit.
[78:31.72]Okay, well.
[78:33.52]Why would I be in any other clothing?
[78:37.54]There's no reason for me to ever put anything else on ever again.
[78:42.39]I found what I want.
[78:54.85]Reading glasses?
[78:55.61]Why do I have reading glasses on?
[79:00.03]I guess they can stay on.
[79:06.52]I don't want a conductor.
[79:07.60]Who cares?
[79:09.26]Yes!
[79:10.86]There we go.
[79:11.50]Oh my god.
[79:14.56]Croacher and Victor Foxtrot Delta both subscribed.
[79:19.92]Re-subscribed.
[79:21.72]I saw it before I told you.
[79:23.34]What did I tell you?
[79:26.68]Both of you guys, thank you.
[79:27.32]Welcome back for two months.
[79:29.67]Much love, dudes.
[79:33.61]Better hold on to that dog hide.
[79:35.47]Yeah, I might need it somewhere.
[79:41.89]Okay, I'm gonna travel.
[79:42.89]I cannot fast travel from here.
[79:44.43]Bullshit.
[79:49.17]Literally Tim Allen.
[79:50.92]Well, thanks, Tim.
[79:51.82]I'm a really big fan of your shows.
[79:52.98]Thanks for resubscribing.
[79:55.75]I failed the speech check already.
[79:57.01]Yeah, and I'm supposed to be all speech.
[79:58.61]Doesn't make any sense.
[80:01.17]Can I get in this and just fucking set myself to toast?
[80:08.82]Space cowboy or riot?
[80:10.22]Fine.
[80:11.06]You'll get it.
[80:11.60]You'll get it.
[80:12.10]You'll get it.
[80:12.54]You'll get it.
[80:12.96]There you go.
[80:24.81]I get to be the lame Woody.
[80:27.81]No, Buzz.
[80:28.97]No, combination of both of them.
[80:37.04]Alright.
[80:38.16]Get the hell out of here.
[80:41.19]Tim Allen approves?
[80:42.15]Good.
[80:43.83]Who doesn't love Tim Allen?
[80:59.38]Mundo Chemical Romance, thank you.
[81:02.38]What's the point of this?
[81:11.16]And Unloading Wolf.
[81:13.00]Both you guys, welcome.
[81:15.24]Thank you so much for subscribing.
[81:16.67]I cannot fast travel either.
[81:19.78]I'm just a toy buzz, yeah?
[81:21.06]I'm a shitty toy buzz.
[81:23.74]Watch it.
[81:24.38]Watch it.
[81:24.96]Watch it.
[81:25.96]This is the wrong way.
[81:31.24]Okay, how do I get out of here?
[81:34.82]Where is the exit?
[81:43.51]I have a lot of problems in tight corridor games like this.
[81:48.60]Because every single thing is identical.
[81:51.38]And I can't do it.
[81:53.82]I wish I could just fast travel out of here.
[81:55.33]I think this is the right way.
[82:06.54]I guess not.
[82:15.14]Is this a shortcut?
[82:15.86]How was I supposed to know there was a shortcut without ever knowing there was a shortcut?
[82:20.18]That's knowledge that you have.
[82:21.30]That's knowledge that I don't have.
[82:22.24]Oh, hold on.
[82:31.02]Uh... Hunting rifle actually is pretty good, isn't it?
[82:40.75]Where is it?
[82:45.52]Oh, what do I want to throw?
[82:52.34]Tweezers.
[82:52.84]I don't need... Why do I have this stuff?
[82:58.87]I just want to show my appreciation to you.
[83:00.17]You've made me laugh harder than any other YouTuber.
[83:02.05]Excited for the big video coming up.
[83:03.27]Keep up the good work.
[83:04.53]Well, thank you, Wolf.
[83:05.73]I appreciate that.
[83:07.99]It is a video.
[83:09.63]It is going to be fairly huge.
[83:11.81]So...
[83:13.72]A lot of money and a lot of time is going to be going into it.
[83:16.60]It already has.
[83:17.16]And that's all I'll say about that.
[83:20.54]But thank you.
[83:20.90]That's really nice of you.
[83:22.16]That's very sweet of you.
[83:24.68]Alright, fast travel.
[83:25.52]Get me out of here.
[83:26.74]Get me out of this fucking zoo of a level.
[83:35.28]Order of Dagon?
[83:36.66]Or is it Dagon?
[83:39.34]Thank you.
[83:40.12]Appreciate it.
[83:41.87]Welcome back.
[83:42.77]For six months, that's a half a year.
[83:44.18]That's a half a fucking year.
[83:48.60]That's a very long time.
[83:55.02]Food in here.
[84:01.06]No, I don't want any of this junk.
[84:15.09]Am I still actually lost in this fucking area?
[84:18.59]Is this actually still happening?
[84:20.87]How do I get out of here?
[84:25.34]Seriously.
[84:26.48]Get me the fuck out of here.
[84:30.36]Where's the elevator?
[84:34.62]I'm so lost in here.
[84:37.94]Where the fuck do I go?
[84:40.94]Everything's the same!
[84:43.88]God help me!
[84:47.22]My computers!
[84:47.94]Do I touch a computer and it'll save me?
[84:50.08]Oh my fucking god, I'm just gonna throw everything in the trash.
[84:52.98]I don't fucking even care!
[84:55.30]No, I need that.
[84:56.74]I need my spacesuit back.
[84:57.76]Where's the spacesuit?
[85:00.62]Where'd it go?
[85:10.73]There it is.
[85:16.45]TCL in the console.
[85:20.15]Okay, get the fuck out of here.
[85:24.16]And my buzz is wearing off.
[85:30.92]I lost my buzz.
[85:34.73]I'm currently going up and down staircases.
[85:41.30]See, my main problem is I can't tell what level this even is.
[85:46.58]Look at this.
[85:46.96]This is a mess.
[85:49.68]This doesn't even look like a level.
[85:52.24]Look at this shit.
[85:53.68]This shit isn't even connected.
[85:55.95]It's a different gradient.
[85:58.75]I'm going straight.
[86:13.26]Not that way.
[86:22.19]Should I just keep going to the left?
[86:28.66]I'm about to fucking noclip out of here.
[86:33.02]Jesus.
[86:35.14]Holy dog shit.
[86:38.83]How am I going to do it all over again?
[86:46.38]Please.
[86:46.72]Okay, turn around.
[86:48.93]Left, left, right, left.
[86:50.31]Down.
[86:51.07]Straight left, down, right.
[86:58.85]Okay.
[87:02.24]Get me out of here.
[87:03.62]Get me the fuck out of here.
[87:05.84]Never coming back here again.
[87:06.72]Alright.
[87:12.92]What's next on the list?
[87:21.82]Find out from Manny Vargas where the Khans were headed.
[87:24.80]Find the men who tried to kill you.
[87:27.98]Isn't this the guy that I dropped the dinosaurs on?
[87:30.00]It was the dinosaur guy, right?
[87:31.53]Remember what happened last time I used noclip?
[87:37.39]Yeah, that's true.
[87:39.11]That is true.
[87:42.84]Yeah, that is the dinosaur guy, isn't it?
[87:55.55]That is dinosaur guy.
[87:56.83]Did I just not?
[87:58.51]Was I too distracted?
[88:04.13]Hey, thanks, Fraymonator.
[88:11.74]Finish fly with me?
[88:15.60]I need atomic fuel.
[88:16.46]I don't know where the hell that is, so maybe I'll find it eventually.
[88:22.45]Yeah, that's true.
[88:23.15]I was once a dinosaur guy.
[88:25.21]Wait, wait, wait.
[88:25.63]Do you have rocket fuel?
[88:27.89]Yeah.
[88:28.81]I'd like to buy some rocket fuel from you, please.
[88:33.05]Give me some cards, too.
[88:34.05]I don't even know what those do.
[88:40.61]Um... Alright, rocket fuel.
[88:47.37]You don't have rocket fuel.
[88:49.90]Well, you're just totally useless to me then, aren't you?
[88:58.81]Kind of just want to give this to her.
[89:00.41]I don't think I'm going to use it for anything.
[89:24.33]Take all this crap.
[89:25.53]I don't want any of it.
[89:29.49]Egg timer.
[89:34.15]Well, that doesn't cure me.
[89:35.73]I need to go to a doctor to cure myself, don't I?
[89:45.66]I'm going to sell this.
[89:46.72]I don't want it.
[89:48.40]Give me those caps.
[89:50.68]I'd rather take caps.
[89:57.53]Take those.
[89:58.33]Take the cigarettes.
[90:00.71]The pilot light paint guns.
[90:03.81]Take the power fist.
[90:07.35]Pressure cooker.
[90:08.83]Where do I even find these things?
[90:10.47]Why do I have them?
[90:13.66]I pick up too many things.
[90:16.52]I'll get rid of the shotgun.
[90:18.06]I am the raddest girl, little honey.
[90:21.80]I will kill you just for... Just for help!
[90:27.92]Kai Kumio has just subscribed.
[90:33.21]I love you.
[90:36.89]Thank you.
[90:38.39]Welcome.
[90:49.42]Alright.
[90:50.80]Let's do this.
[90:51.20]At least I have some money.
[90:54.36]Can you get, like, robbed in this game?
[90:55.52]Wait, what?! !
[91:00.01]And we have another buddy.
[91:01.57]Another buddy joining the seven-month club.
[91:03.83]That is seven months in a row.
[91:08.89]I love you.
[91:16.02]Nobody's cleaned this up yet.
[91:18.32]You would have to imagine that the guy up there would have eventually come in here and at least taken care of this.
[91:25.95]I guess not.
[91:29.56]Nah, I'll just leave that guy.
[91:31.64]Who cares?
[91:36.05]Leave a decapitated body just sitting on the ground.
[91:38.15]That makes perfect sense.
[91:41.23]He's gone.
[91:42.03]Where'd he go?
[91:45.72]What are you doing?
[91:46.38]What was I supposed to do again?
[91:49.98]Sigh.
[92:06.14]Fuck.
[92:15.36]What do I need for this?
[92:16.36]The body is your reminder.
[92:23.28]Your punishment of what you did.
[92:24.84]Not just to Dino Man, but to space and time.
[92:30.01]The spaceship toys are full of rocket fuel.
[92:31.73]Didn't I already give it to him?
[92:35.15]Alright, well, let's fucking go.
[92:36.47]Okay.
[92:42.24]I'm going that way.
[92:47.86]Let's move.
[92:51.47]Make the jump.
[93:07.86]Check his computer.
[93:09.03]What's on his computer?
[93:15.89]Hmm.
[93:19.85]Mean dog?
[93:21.34]Nice dog?
[93:23.56]Nice dog.
[93:24.26]Okay.
[93:24.74]Good.
[93:28.78]Can you kill something, please?
[93:33.14]He's got a lot of dogs.
[93:37.39]Alright, for one second, I thought it was a dog.
[93:40.83]It was the guy I needed to talk to.
[93:43.66]Urugash.
[93:45.42]Welcome.
[93:46.02]Thank you so much.
[93:46.78]There's a baseball bat there, and I'm gonna get it.
[93:49.98]Dog, get out of the way.
[93:52.30]Move.
[93:57.80]Why do you have to have a fucking guard dog?
[94:03.76]Cat, go in this other room.
[94:07.85]Get out of here.
[94:08.47]Excuse me.
[94:10.27]Yeah.
[94:10.37]Do you have any thrust control modules?
[94:15.07]500.
[94:15.09]500 caps.
[94:15.27]Ooh, barter.
[94:15.55]Fuck.
[94:15.65]Hold on a minute.
[94:17.21]I'll be back.
[94:39.09]I'll be right back.
[94:43.63]How close am I to leveling up?
[94:49.31]Yeah.
[94:49.69]I'm going to go kill a monster and then come back.
[94:59.54]Where is just a random person to kill?
[95:04.46]I want to level up and put a couple points into his speech.
[95:09.41]There we go, there's some fucking animals.
[95:12.74]Rainbow Tylenol, welcome.
[95:15.12]Alright, can I kill one more ant?
[95:17.56]It's a very interesting name, Rainbow Tylenol.
[95:38.69]Nonetheless, thank you very much.
[95:44.31]Come on, give me something else.
[95:47.63]Come on.
[95:48.11]Give me the corn.
[95:51.69]Can I pick up the corn?
[95:54.23]What the fuck?
[95:55.40]It's like an upside-down pineapple.
[95:56.72]It's not corn.
[96:04.10]Where are the dangerous animals that roam the wilderness?
[96:06.52]I'd like to see some of them, please.
[96:10.65]I'd love to see you.
[96:11.75]I would do anything to see you.
[96:14.54]I might just spawn him.
[96:15.76]I think I'm gonna spawn one enemy.
[96:19.88]I'm gonna spawn an enemy.
[96:26.68]Uh... Fuck.
[96:34.61]I tried a random thing and it didn't work.
[96:38.51]Cheater.
[96:42.00]I was cheating.
[96:42.74]You're right.
[96:43.12]I've crippled.
[96:51.83]Crippled, really?
[96:52.73]It didn't even go through.
[96:55.65]It didn't even go through.
[96:57.13]Don't worry.
[96:57.55]You guys act like it went through.
[97:06.39]Cheats.
[97:06.85]Tsk, tsk.
[97:10.34]Where are the rats?
[97:11.44]There was two rats and now there's no rats.
[97:19.15]Come on.
[97:20.97]You mean to tell me those are the only two rats in this whole area?
[97:27.09]What a load of shit.
[97:31.21]Where's the give yourself 500 experience?
[97:40.82]Oh, there's somebody.
[97:44.22]I kind of don't care who you are.
[97:45.10]I'm going to kill you just because I want the experience.
[97:46.76]Who are you?
[97:48.46]Where are you from?
[97:55.69]Fuck, no, I can't kill you.
[97:58.29]Fuck.
[98:00.97]Give me somebody.
[98:01.73]There we go.
[98:02.23]I see him in the distance.
[98:03.87]Yeah.
[98:05.44]Time to die.
[98:13.80]Ah, excuse me.
[98:16.72]What?
[98:17.86]Whoa!
[98:21.02]What are they doing?
[98:22.02]What are they doing?
[98:40.27]What are they doing?
[98:43.36]There was just fireworks going off.
[98:46.72]There were no mines?
[98:48.32]Those are just... somebody was launching fireworks at me.
[98:51.04]And I'm all the fucking way... Okay, I'm killing the merchant.
[98:56.86]Yeah, somebody just drove a plane down and dropped missiles on me.
[99:02.85]For the love of fucking God, give me a break.
[99:08.66]Almost had him.
[99:10.77]Do I just take this person's head off?
[99:13.01]They're part of that of the town though, aren't they?
[99:14.75]I'll get myself in some trouble.
[99:22.03]Yeah, I'm supposed to find those guys to level 40?
[99:24.46]Yeah, well.
[99:26.24]They don't know who they're dealing with.
[99:29.16]They don't know who they're dealing with.
[99:30.26]They're dealing with a broken professional right now.
[99:33.50]Yo, they're called the Bombers.
[99:35.88]We're the Bombers.
[99:36.75]Hmm.
[99:39.10]Well, let's see how they deal with this.
[99:42.26]Hmm.
[99:48.04]Hmm.
[99:48.70]Bombers.
[99:51.82]I've got some bombs of my own now, don't I?
[99:53.45]Excuse me.
[99:59.83]Guys with the magical fireworks.
[100:05.58]Okay, go.
[100:06.40]Run.
[100:07.58]Why am I on fire?
[100:09.68]Why am I on fire?
[100:11.56]Why would I be on fire?
[100:13.18]Did I level up?
[100:15.14]Alright, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me.
[100:16.48]Guys, guys, guys, guys.
[100:17.26]Run, run, run.
[100:18.28]Yeah, shoot him.
[100:20.26]Get these guys.
[100:20.86]Where's my experience?
[100:30.15]Yes, I got a hit.
[100:32.09]Level up.
[100:34.17]I thought that was me.
[100:35.33]I thought that was me.
[100:39.90]I thought that was me.
[100:44.36]Okay, 50 speech.
[100:55.01]Speech, sneak, signs, repair, lockpick.
[100:59.29]Get this to at least a position where I can do it.
[101:06.95]Okay.
[101:07.35]Confirm bachelor.
[101:08.21]Intense training.
[101:08.93]Should I do another point of strength?
[101:15.53]Barter?
[101:16.01]Barter?
[101:16.35]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[101:16.87]What do you mean barter?
[101:17.93]What's going on?
[101:20.63]50 speech.
[101:23.05]50 speech.
[101:24.35]Why would I want to do barter?
[101:33.64]I feel like I made a grave mistake, apparently, according to chat.
[101:38.45]It was $50.
[101:38.75]I could talk to her.
[101:46.17]Retention.
[101:47.47]Lady killer.
[101:48.13]Cannibal.

[104:56.66]Okay.
[104:57.78]It's up the stairs.
[105:03.12]There's no cliff in it.
[105:05.42]I'm really considering it.
[105:06.52]I kind of don't give a shit.
[105:10.25]If everybody thinks I'm a scrub.
[105:12.83]What else is new?
[105:23.87]Okay.

[106:29.57]Yeah, they did.
[106:30.49]What are you talking about?
[106:31.43]I hope I can blow this fucking rocket up and never come back here again.
[106:43.60]I should have taken this shortcut.
[106:49.58]I should have taken this shortcut.
[106:50.70]Fuck George Washington.
[106:51.74]I should have taken this shortcut.
[107:03.10]George Washington sucks.
[107:09.77]I love how it took him seven seconds to think of someone else.
[107:13.29]Yeah, it did.
[107:18.43]Oh!
[107:19.86]God!
[107:25.64]Should've taken the shortcut.

[110:38.24]Jason told me himself the great journey is for ghouls, only you're not going.
[110:40.94]Yeah, you're not going, buddy.
[110:41.98]Oh, God.
[110:43.41]You're telling me the truth, aren't you?
[110:45.19]I am.
[110:46.77]Oh, no.
[110:48.19]How could they do this to me?
[110:50.31]For two years.
[110:52.31]My God, I've been a joke to them.
[110:55.40]Please don't.
[110:55.72]Yeah, go for it.

[110:56.98]Alright, let's get some sugar bombs.
[111:28.95]quest.
[111:30.31]Sugar bombs.
[111:34.74]Where are the sugar bombs?
[111:37.28]Who can I buy them from?
[111:45.05]Please tell me they're like right here somewhere.
[111:53.37]Alright.
[111:53.75]Shortcut.
[111:54.67]People are going to scream at me.

[112:00.09]Look at that.
[112:01.67]Got the shortcut, guys.
[112:02.67]I was trying just to not use it.
[112:21.30]I was trying just to walk through it.
[112:24.68]Alright.
[112:25.60]We're good.
[112:26.64]What the hell are we?
[112:29.22]I need to get a bird's eye view of this.
[112:30.44]Let me make sure I just know where I am.
[112:32.92]Okay.
[112:33.82]I know where that is.
[112:43.95]Sugar bombs.
[112:44.45]That's the name of the game.
[112:51.75]Where can I get sugar bombs?
[112:56.64]That's a slippery slope of cheating.
[113:01.43]I know.
[113:08.03]Play a place at me.
[113:08.99]You want me just to spawn three sugar bombs?
[113:17.24]No, fuck that.
[113:18.24]I gotta play the game, man.
[113:20.08]I can't be that much of a dipshit.
[113:22.32]Where are they?
[113:25.16]That would be the laziest fucking thing ever.
[113:37.56]What is the sugarbomb command?
[113:39.88]What's the sugarbomb command?
[113:40.90]3-0-0-8-C-5-5-1.
[113:42.68]3!
[113:42.70]Do I have 3?
[113:43.58]Sugarbombs, where are they?
[114:16.51]Hey, she needs sugar pops.
[114:17.76]I got them.
[114:18.76]I think I found them.
[114:19.48]I only have one.
[114:22.56]That's not going to do.
[114:24.82]Alright, that's better.
[114:31.40]There we go.
[114:31.94]Alright.
[114:32.34]Get some extras.
[114:35.15]Let's just get the fuck back over there.
[114:36.67]What do you say, guys?
[114:44.74]This is too much power.
[114:45.60]I should have never done this.
[114:47.44]I never should have done this.
[114:55.25]Look, I didn't want to have to go find sugar.
[114:57.63]That's a dumb thing to do.
[114:59.73]Alright, let's go.
[115:00.13]Yeah, I got some sugar.
[115:00.75]I got them.
[115:01.05]Took me a while.
[115:01.65]Alright, the larkets are ready.
[115:02.61]Let's do it.
[115:02.89]Yes, I'll tell James.
[115:15.03]There we go.
[115:16.49]Ready to carry you and your little clan on the great journey.
[115:20.62]Bon voyage.
[115:21.86]How do I get a better view?
[115:22.56]Oh, I know.
[115:26.78]Gather all.
[115:30.18]May the creator guide my words.
[115:32.00]I get a better view.
[115:33.18]The almighty creator has seen fit to answer our prayers.
[115:38.55]The time has come for us to board the rockets and begin the great journey.
[115:44.94]though it may seem that all humans despise us.
[115:48.40]The creator has seen fit to instruct us differently.
[115:52.02]Yep.
[115:52.86]Let's go.
[115:53.40]The journey ahead would have been impossible if not for the intercession of two human friends.
[115:59.96]Yeah.
[116:00.82]Give him the speech.
[116:01.58]The other a long-abiding companion.
[116:05.60]To our new friend, say thanks and promise never to forget how we cleared from our path the demons who sought to stay our journey.
[116:14.05]Okay.
[116:19.38]Are you serious?
[116:21.30]Holy shit.
[116:27.62]Get me in the spaceship.
[116:29.66]Get me in the spaceship.
[116:38.54]Shit.
[116:43.46]Why are they bringing laser guns to space?
[116:47.47]Shouldn't they not be doing that?
[116:50.81]Hold on a second.
[116:51.63]Fuck these guys.
[116:53.79]I'll show you how it's done.
[116:54.69]You guys want to see how it's done?
[116:59.15]No, no, no.
[116:59.51]Wait, wait, wait.
[116:59.83]I've got to activate the quest first.
[117:05.88]Where is he?
[117:08.08]Come here.
[117:11.12]He just got scared of me.
[117:16.66]Alright, let's go.
[117:21.11]Let me save it in here first.
[117:23.55]It's important.
[117:34.45]Okay.
[117:36.97]What's with this guy?
[117:40.90]Talk to him.
[117:44.76]Tell him to launch the rockets, man.
[117:47.54]Tell...
[117:52.47]Tell him.
[117:54.13]Get on that fucking intercom and tell him right now.
[117:56.29]Okay.
[117:59.06]Good.
[117:59.48]Hey.
[117:59.60]Hey.
[117:59.80]Alright.
[118:00.18]Get it.
[118:00.44]Go.
[118:23.80]Oh, fuck.
[118:26.20]Did I break it?
[118:27.64]What if I talk to him?
[118:28.28]Okay, goodbye.
[118:29.32]Go for it.
[118:33.36]Ugh.
[118:58.94]I have to wait till he starts talking.
[119:00.22]Alright, go for it.
[119:00.80]Start talking.
[119:01.37]Please go.
[119:01.95]Yeah.
[119:02.21]Yeah.
[119:23.06]I don't want this.
[119:23.70]I'm safe here.
[119:44.39]What if I just spawn a deathclaw right now?
[119:46.47]To our new friends, we say thanks and promise never to forget how we cleared from our path the demons sought to stay our journey.
[119:56.93]Good morning.
[119:57.56]Good morning.
[120:00.04]Chris, you have made this great journey a reality.
[120:04.92]From this moment forward, you will be remembered as the saint of the great journey.
[120:11.30]We shall never forget you.
[120:14.01]I ask that you forgive us, Chris.
[120:15.95]This is very long.
[120:16.65]And give us your blessing.
[120:18.85]I can save it here, too.
[120:22.19]Seekers, board the rockets.
[120:24.56]Take your seats.
[120:26.14]The great journey awaits.
[120:29.02]To the promised land we go.
[120:32.18]To the far beyond.
[120:37.48]What is the, uh, what is the command?
[120:40.46]No, no, no, no.
[120:42.88]Enough.
[120:43.70]I'm gonna watch them go off.
[120:51.47]Get in your rockets.
[121:00.07]He's doing something over there.
[121:02.87]Go on in.
[121:03.45]Get in.
[121:06.57]Morning.
[121:09.19]They're not going to go in?
[121:10.77]Here he goes.
[121:11.09]Oh, fuck off, guys.
[121:16.94]Come on, really?
[121:18.82]Wait, wait, what if I... Come on.
[121:24.96]See?
[121:25.30]I'm in here.
[121:25.66]I never was down there at all.
[121:29.52]Alright, well, let's fucking...
[121:38.74]Head up to the viewing platform.
[121:42.50]Where is the viewing platform?
[121:46.90]Looks like it's up there.
[121:51.74]Okay.
[121:57.17]Alright.
[122:00.53]Alright, let's go to that viewing platform.
[122:04.09]What do you say, guys?
[122:10.51]Viewing platform.
[122:11.35]Is that a viewing platform?
[122:17.48]Looks like it's back here somewhere.
[122:21.92]I have the shortcut too.
[122:23.08]I don't even need to do this.
[122:26.58]What am I doing?
[122:28.54]Don't have to be doing this.
[122:38.34]So much to do.
[122:39.08]So much to see.
[122:42.66]Somebody has to stop him.
[122:44.66]That's a great comment.
[122:47.16]Somebody stop him.
[122:49.70]No, I don't want to wait.
[122:56.42]Uh-oh.
[122:57.26]Uh-oh.
[122:57.82]Uh-oh.
[122:58.36]Uh-oh.
[123:00.31]Uh-oh.
[123:04.57]Uh-oh.
[123:07.31]Uh-oh.
[123:07.69]Uh-oh.
[123:10.03]This might be an uh-oh moment.
[123:14.08]Uh-oh.
[123:16.52]Where am I?
[123:18.92]No, we're fine.
[123:26.80]I'm gonna... Let's go back here.
[123:32.01]Okay.
[123:33.21]I'm drunk with power.
[123:39.15]To the promised land we go.
[123:42.29]To the far...
[123:50.91]Alright, where are we going?
[123:52.84]Where's the actual way to go?
[124:01.38]Head up to the viewing platform?
[124:02.72]Where's the viewing platform, then?
[124:04.31]Like, up here or something?
[124:09.01]Or is it back inside the building?
[124:17.16]Up there?
[124:23.54]You're wasting more time trying to cheat than playing normally.
[124:34.67]TLC up there.
[124:35.63]It's outside.
[124:54.60]Like in this building, I'm going to assume.
[124:59.61]Research labs.
[125:09.11]TLC, the learning channel, yeah.
[125:17.08]We're not learning very much here.
[125:23.99]Spun in a viewing platform.
[125:27.56]That would be funny.
[125:38.18]I mean, this is kind of where I was going before.
[125:56.62]Okay, saving.
[126:09.91]Launch.
[126:10.27]Um...
[126:25.55]Music's kind of fitting.
[126:26.45]That one didn't even go anywhere.
[126:33.45]I want to see.
[126:44.02]I want to get a better look.
[126:44.98]Hey, I leveled up.
[126:53.82]Hold on a second.
[126:55.94]This doesn't count.
[126:57.36]This doesn't count.
[126:57.90]This is important.
[127:07.28]I want to get out there.
[127:08.38]Can I do it through the wall?
[127:27.06]Come on, do it.
[127:27.62]I don't want to be... I want to be outside when I hit the button.
[127:40.32]Come on, get up there.
[127:41.24]I want to run into the rockets.
[127:49.01]That's a better view, at least.
[127:54.81]Okay, can I...
[127:58.17]Can I get real noclip and legit just go stand in front of that?
[128:06.69]This is too bad.
[128:10.97]Enable player controls.
[128:13.27]Okay, you got it.
[128:16.87]This has to happen, guys.
[128:17.79]I have to try this at least one more time.
[128:27.47]Alright, so enable player controls.
[128:41.42]Get over there.
[128:41.94]Come on.
[128:43.98]Come on.
[128:46.26]Come on.
[128:52.02]I have to get over here.
[128:55.93]Dammit!
[129:00.60]Shit!
[129:03.40]I don't think it does anything.
[129:04.32]I don't think I can die from it.
[129:12.04]I would have taken damage there, I'm assuming.
[129:17.50]You're still technically inside.
[129:20.38]I guess so.
[129:24.00]Alright, let's get lockpicking to 25, so I can at least open fucking easy shit doors.
[129:29.98]And I'll get barred at a 50.
[129:33.64]And... where's medicine?
[129:43.66]Shouldn't they still be alive in here?
[129:44.76]Alright.
[129:50.07]Let's go back to normal.
[129:55.27]That wasn't very normal, but you know, you get the idea.
[130:06.10]So the ghouls are taken care of now, right?
[130:09.22]Theoretically.
[130:17.25]So I'm really liked in Novak now, okay.
[130:23.72]Why would you upgrade lockpick when you can just cheat?
[130:25.83]Because cheating is just for goofs.
[130:29.19]This is a temporary goof.
[130:35.23]You have any luck with the ghouls?
[130:36.27]I did it.
[130:38.84]Really?
[130:39.48]Unbelievable, man.
[130:40.58]I knew that wasn't going to be easy.
[130:42.64]But I had a good feeling about you.
[130:44.18]You look like you've been through a lot.
[130:47.84]Now can you tell me what I want to know?
[130:48.98]Okay.
[130:49.52]I'll tell you everything I know.
[130:51.17]Like I promised.
[130:52.64]Where is Boulder City?
[130:53.12]It was a goof of the day.
[130:53.82]Alright, let's keep going.
[130:54.60]Yeah, whatever, goodbye.
[131:18.01]Idolized renowned for your extensive support and goodwill you are idolized by the community and not that cool Thanks guys This is the longest temporary goof.
[131:31.16]Oh, you'd be surprised you'd be surprised how long a temporary goof can last Wait what?
[131:40.31]I think I missed a couple of subscriptions, too.
[131:42.29]That was Based Scoob from a while back.
[131:45.87]Like 15 minutes ago.
[131:46.79]Three months.
[131:47.37]Thank you, Based Scoob.
[131:48.65]And Bazmech just now for three months as well.
[131:52.63]Thanks, both of you.

[131:59.76]Thanks a lot, guys.
[132:03.06]So where to up here?
[132:14.61]Looks like we just go this way.

[132:24.95]Radiation.
[132:26.51]Yeah, whatever.
[132:29.39]Need to restrict my console commands.
[132:30.97]Yeah, somebody does.
[132:34.39]Somebody sure does.
[132:46.87]Are they goofs or gaffs?
[132:49.89]Uh, I'd probably consider them a gaff.
[132:51.97]Or, you know, goof, too.
[132:52.89]Whatever you feel like saying.
[132:56.46]Could be either or.
[132:58.60]Doesn't have to be exclusive.
[133:06.40]Just as long as we're going the right way.
[133:07.36]That's all I care about.
[133:19.80]Going north.
[133:21.10]This map is huge, too, by the way.

[133:32.15]Take it easy, Red Ranger.
[133:33.09]Thanks for coming out, man.
[133:42.79]Something to explore?
[133:43.41]I think so.
[133:54.03]This is the real exciting part of the streams.
[133:56.95]Where we run.
[133:58.79]We run around in Fallout.
[134:02.25]All exciting stuff.
[134:07.26]I do want to look at what this is, though.
[134:10.56]I'm curious.

[134:15.58]Helios 1.

[134:37.60]Should I break in here?
[134:38.76]I mean, it's very easy.
[134:45.58]Am I going to get in trouble for doing this?
[134:48.04]Let's find out.
[134:54.46]It's very easy to lock.
[134:57.12]Can't even open an easy lock.
[135:11.54]Whoa.
[135:15.32]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[135:17.92]Oh, okay.

[137:07.09]I'm going to let every single door hit me in the face.
[137:14.09]Let's just go where I'm supposed to be going.
[137:15.25]I don't have time for this shit.
[137:17.90]A bunch of satellite dishes?
[137:26.28]What is this?
[137:28.00]Are those giant movie theater chairs?
[137:32.81]Cool.
[137:34.99]Wow.
[137:43.08]Let me get my weapon ready.
[137:43.90]I feel like there could be some gorillas out here or something.
[137:46.81]You can launch a nuke.
[137:59.91]You can do a lot of cool things in this game, can't you?
[138:05.66]Nobody tell Jerma he can do...
[138:08.50]all these different things.
[138:21.39]Freshly canned sushi.
[138:23.70]Do they canned sushi?
[138:24.60]Can you actually get canned sushi?
[138:26.76]Does that work?
[138:34.26]Regardless.
[138:36.29]Hey dude, welcome.
[138:39.04]Hope your freshly canned sushi is delicious.
[138:42.72]You can spawn nukes.
[138:46.81]I don't want that power.
[138:50.17]I'm not cheating again for a little while.
[138:52.49]No more cheating.
[138:53.19]Oh, hi there.
[138:58.49]Wait, what?
[139:00.33]Hi there, Raja Scorpion.
[139:05.40]Jeebus.
[139:07.80]Hi, Jeebus.
[139:11.79]Thank you for the two months, Jeebus.
[139:22.96]I still hear him creepy crawling around.
[139:30.74]Battle music has ended.
[139:31.58]That means it's time to go.
[139:44.88]Lactose Cow.
[139:45.90]A lot of subscribers tonight.
[139:48.52]Thank you very much, Lactose Cow.
[139:50.87]And all the others.
[140:00.97]That guy's got a sword.
[140:01.55]Does he have a sword?
[140:05.44]It's a baseball bat.
[140:06.98]Don't do that to me.
[140:08.58]A customer.
[140:09.88]Not many people come into Boulder City these days.
[140:15.28]Well, have a good sleep, S-Vac.
[140:17.78]S-Fave.
[140:18.64]S-Fac.
[140:19.24]Whatever your name is.
[140:20.56]Thanks for coming on.
[140:25.71]Alright.
[140:26.87]What do you got?
[140:29.09]Yum yum deviled eggs.
[140:31.23]Those sound pretty good.
[140:34.55]Get rid of some of my crap.
[140:47.25]And then Zivago.
[140:59.74]Zivago.
[141:01.84]Thank you, welcome.
[141:05.44]You wonderful, wonderful person, you.
[141:07.00]Okay, does this guy have, like, Radex or anything?
[141:14.24]Got a lot of booze.
[141:15.35]I guess it makes sense.
[141:16.05]He's a bar.
[141:16.85]Alright.
[141:26.31]I don't need Cabrisma.
[141:31.44]I'm gonna eat the yum yum deviled eggs.
[141:33.22]That'll sound good.
[141:46.45]Man, this sells for a lot.
[141:47.50]This guy doesn't have very many caps.
[141:49.66]I gotta keep that in mind.
[141:50.74]This guy's pretty broke.
[142:05.68]Space lasers?
[142:06.52]Okay, I'm just gonna talk to him now.
[142:09.18]I don't know, this guy's face is really freaking me out.
[142:12.48]He looks like a Gerber baby with a mustache.
[142:15.12]Doesn't he look like a fucking baby?
[142:16.36]Dude, people don't look like this is a baby.
[142:35.19]Most of the limestone comes from Quarry Junction out west.
[142:38.07]With no work to be had, all the workers around here have wandered- Okay.
[142:43.12]Thanks for the info.
[142:58.81]Oh shit, I'm making too much noise!
[142:59.99]Oh shit!
[143:02.07]I'm so sorry!
[143:14.85]Quickly, get it off.
[143:15.59]Quick.
[143:16.09]Quick.
[143:21.40]Fucking everything.
[143:22.04]Sleep in his bed.
[143:25.63]The broom.
[143:36.89]pilot light out of his stove.
[143:38.21]Are you serious?
[143:40.79]What kind of a dick takes a pilot light out of somebody's stove?
[143:45.42]You can't even do anything.
[143:46.18]You can't use that for anything.
[143:47.34]Anything else?
[144:07.22]Thanks for the info, prick.
[144:12.08]Steal the bat.
[144:14.84]Check your karma?
[144:18.12]What's that noise?
[144:18.70]What is my karma?
[144:27.17]Where do you see your karma?
[144:37.59]I just don't know where you see it.
[144:42.84]Karma does like nothing in New Vegas.
[144:44.24]Who cares?
[144:44.86]Oh, well then whatever.
[144:49.34]You want to see a federal offense?
[144:50.68]I'm not taking anybody's mail, dude.
[144:51.99]That's a bad idea.
[144:52.63]You're going to get me in trouble.
[144:59.65]Fuck, thank God.
[145:00.61]Thank God there's no mail in there.
[145:09.33]Kind of a useless building, but, you know, whatever.
[145:11.31]It's okay.
[145:12.61]Ripe for Nana.
[145:14.47]Is that supposed to be Ripe Banana?
[145:17.03]Thank you for subscribing, Ripe.
[145:20.88]Much love, much respect.
[145:33.88]One of my patrols was on its way back from Novak when it came under fire from the Great Khans.
[145:38.18]The Great Khans.
[145:38.90]They radioed for reinforcements, but instead of waiting for us, they chased the Khans into the ruins where they were caught in a crossfire.
[145:45.48]No deaths, but not all the squads.
[145:49.79]Once the Great Khans have been killed... Track down the Khans.
[145:52.13]Kill the Khans.
[145:53.09]...any property they've taken from you.
[145:54.73]Go kill King Kong.
[145:55.65]I get it.
[145:57.41]Normally, I'd turn you down since I have no idea who you are.
[146:01.01]But considering that the... Alright.
[146:04.31]If we hear shooting, we'll be coming in.
[146:05.95]You're not going to help me?
[146:09.72]Good luck.
[146:12.26]Let's go.
[146:13.50]Boulder City Showdown.
[146:14.78]Let's go kill the great cons.
[146:24.41]Is this in the ruins?
[146:25.37]Okay.
[146:26.09]Okay.
[146:36.30]Save it.
[146:37.85]Let's do some... So these are good guys.
[146:44.77]Alright, I'm going in.
[146:51.82]Those who would dare try to stand in my way.
[146:54.94]Just know that... What?
[147:01.57]Is this the guy?
[147:06.91]This is the great con.
[147:16.45]Intercept the great cons at Boulder City.
[147:18.61]Find the men who tried to kill you.
[147:19.91]What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[147:23.73]Am I supposed to kill this guy?
[147:26.49]This is a great con.
[147:27.15]You all say the same thing.
[147:45.05]Oh, shit.
[147:45.49]What's going on?
[147:48.65]I think I did it.
[147:52.47]I think I won.
[147:56.93]I'm pretty sure I won.
[147:58.09]Wait a minute.
[148:13.00]Why are you shooting at me?
[148:15.06]That's the guy I just rescued, right?
[148:20.97]What is this guy doing?
[148:25.01]Private Ackerman, you need to chill the fuck out.
[148:26.85]Stop.
[148:28.39]There's no reason for you to be shooting.
[148:29.41]I just rescued you.
[148:30.18]I'm going to shoot your friend.
[148:35.58]It's going to be a lot of problems.
[148:37.20]Uh-oh.
[148:40.70]Uh-oh, this guy's looking over at you.
[148:49.92]Come on, shoot your friend.
[148:50.98]Where's the prone button?
[148:55.86]I'm going to kill this guy?
[148:56.78]Okay, look, I have to do this.
[148:59.52]Oh, come on.
[149:41.22]Yeah, you have something with mine.
[149:44.55]His hair.
[149:44.95]He's got like three hairs pushed up into gel.
[149:46.41]Restart the whole game?
[150:09.29]Restart the whole game that guy just said Jack McGee 42 Thanks dude welcome Jack McGee 42 Yeah, what can you tell me about better one of the chairman big shots around the tops casino in New Vegas I
[150:36.11]Yeah, poker chips.
[150:37.99]Never mind.
[150:38.67]Let's talk about something else.
[150:40.37]Why don't you just shoot your way out of here?
[150:41.56]Yeah, let's talk about settling things.
[150:43.50]Ooh.
[150:43.62]Free the hostages now, and I'll have the NCR escort you out of their territory.
[151:02.07]Don't even need to fight, easy.
[151:03.03]Ooh, thanks for the lighter.
[151:03.85]Sure, will do.
[151:04.61]Okay, let me think about this for a second here.
[151:07.09]Melee weapons.
[151:07.53]Let's get this thing to fucking 60.
[151:10.47]Um...
[151:33.97]More medicine?
[151:34.55]I'm doing more medicine.
[151:39.18]This is probably an important Gunslinger.
[151:40.82]No.
[151:47.34]I have a terrible personality.
[151:48.58]5% extra damage with all weapons.
[151:58.53]I kind of like that.
[152:02.15]They explode into blood?
[152:03.45]That seems like a lot of fun.
[152:08.84]Ian Animator.
[152:17.06]The Ian Animator.
[152:20.40]Thanks a lot, man.
[152:20.86]Welcome.
[152:22.48]I'm doing bloody mess.
[152:25.62]I want to see lots of explosions.
[152:28.92]So I did it.
[152:30.20]And not a single drop of blood was spilled.
[152:37.36]Here come the prisoners.
[152:40.17]I did it, guys.
[152:40.73]I rescued them and nobody even had to get hurt.
[152:43.07]See, this is a good-natured stream.
[152:45.31]Told you, guys.
[152:45.67]You serious?
[153:01.58]Uh... Hey, they did let him go.
[153:06.22]If you have any integrity, then you'll honor the deal.
[153:16.68]Yeah.
[153:18.34]See, you guys think I'm so bad, I steal shit, I kill people.
[153:24.63]I just got some good karma.
[153:29.79]And now everyone thinks I'm a good person.
[153:32.78]That felt good.
[153:35.02]Didn't even need to fucking do anything.
[153:36.12]That was perfect.
[153:37.38]That was the best quest.
[153:38.76]And now I have all these friends.
[153:40.36]And I leveled up again.
[153:42.68]Damn.
[153:52.00]I'll take another level up.
[153:57.85]Status.
[153:58.59]Press R.
[154:07.04]It's not really doing anything.
[154:10.54]Signs repair 25.
[154:11.50]I'll do that next time.
[154:15.45]What's next on the list of things to do?
[154:18.73]Ring-a-ding-ding.
[154:19.53]Confront Benny at the Tops Casino.
[154:21.41]Get to go to the casino.
[154:22.13]Thank God.
[154:23.69]Oh, it's going to be fucking amazing.
[154:24.77]Can't wait to go to the casino.
[154:28.57]Yep.
[154:29.59]Casino.
[154:30.77]I don't care about anything else.
[154:36.69]I'm running in a straight line to the casino.
[154:43.03]Some say that Jerma's small heart grew three sizes that day.
[154:46.48]Fancy meeting you here, friend.
[154:52.26]Fuck off.
[154:52.74]No, no, it ain't my fault that Dorothy and the Tin Man have... Fancy pants?
[155:00.38]No, I ain't seen hot in the hair of him since the tussle in Goodsprings.
[155:05.33]I'm sure he ran back to the soft living in New Vegas, though.
[155:08.95]I like this guy's voice.
[155:11.01]It's good to see you, Victor.
[155:16.56]Yep.
[155:16.78]Yep.
[155:16.86]Yep.
[155:17.52]Yep.
[155:18.04]Yep.
[155:18.58]Yep.
[155:26.84]I don't care about anything else.
[155:28.50]Seriously.
[155:29.08]I just want to go to the casino.
[155:32.84]I just wanna play blackjack.
[155:35.43]Did these dogs just appear out of nowhere?
[155:41.37]Where did you guys come from?
[155:44.11]You're supposed to explode.
[155:45.97]I didn't see any explosions from you two.
[155:54.30]Kill EZ Pete.
[155:55.50]People are still saying that shit?
[155:57.54]We're still talking about EZ Pete from like seven hours ago?
[156:05.39]Yeah, my perception is one.
[156:08.23]God, that's really, really depressing.
[156:09.69]What's going on down there?
[156:13.90]Do we take a quick little detour before we go to the casino?
[156:20.60]Nah, let's take a little detour.
[156:21.88]Why not?
[156:22.18]Isn't that the robot I was just talking to?
[156:27.41]Where are you going?
[156:31.35]He's kind of just skiing in here.
[156:36.70]Ranger Station?
[156:40.41]Huh.
[156:41.67]There's so many different places and people and, like, factions in this game.
[156:46.47]This is just so... This is cool.
[156:48.25]He's following you.
[157:04.16]Anything interesting around here?
[157:05.24]I have not, but I'm sure you're going to tell me.
[157:08.14]Go for it.
[157:08.48]What do you do?
[157:09.64]Alright, bye.
[157:10.08]I could just whack her in the head, right?
[157:33.63]What does that say?
[157:34.65]The NCR needs you strong.
[157:36.15]Do not eat... Irradiated food.
[157:40.72]Irradiated.
[157:41.68]Irradiated.
[157:43.58]Irradiated.
[157:47.06]Keep a note of that.
[157:47.71]Wait, let me make sure there's nothing else in here I can take.
[157:50.83]And I do mean take, guys.
[157:55.31]Could just fucking kill this guy in his sleep, couldn't I?
[157:57.31]Hey.
[158:01.86]I was trying to one hit kill him.
[158:03.54]That's all I wanted to do and it didn't work.
[158:15.13]I wanted his head to explode.
[158:30.31]Irrigated.
[158:30.84]Yeah, they irrigated the water supply.
[158:37.56]Jerma seems like such a nice guy.
[158:38.76]Then he plays a Bethesda game and becomes a monster.
[158:40.74]Well, everybody's a monster in these games, aren't they?
[158:45.37]Everybody's a monster when you play a Bethesda game.
[158:54.34]I reached a level 8 in Undertale.
[158:55.82]I did.
[159:03.00]What about the water?
[159:06.26]Anything cool in the water?
[159:08.00]I bet you there is something cool in this water.
[159:12.90]Watch, I'm gonna find, like, the Galapagos Islands.
[159:19.08]Already drowning.
[159:20.04]Already drowning!
[159:20.64]What kind of a game you drown that quick?
[159:22.86]You drown that quickly in this game?
[159:28.52]I can hold my breath way longer than that.
[159:31.02]I'm curious.
[159:31.54]Hold on a second.
[159:34.30]Ready guys?
[159:34.91]You ready for this?
[159:44.95]I'm still going.
[159:49.72]I'm still going.
[159:50.28]I'm still holding.
[160:02.87]I could have done that for way longer.
[160:04.23]Like, give me a break.
[160:05.07]This is the one endurance.
[160:08.88]I'm pretty sure even, like, a nine-year-old can hold their breath for more than eight seconds underwater.
[160:15.56]Like, okay, when I was, like, twelve, when I was ten, I could go under and just sit there.
[160:20.63]And I used to go there, like, swim around, you put your goggles on.
[160:25.37]Bullshit.
[160:27.81]I was not breathing through my nose.
[160:30.05]You think I'm that much of a chump?
[160:34.45]I guess he's in the water.
[160:36.65]What a psycho.
[160:39.45]You've done a good turn for the NCR, and now we'd like to do one for you.
[160:43.29]There's an NCR emergency two-way radio.
[160:46.13]You call, and we'll come in.
[160:47.94]You're not alone out here.
[160:49.20]I'm an eight or nine-year-old, but I was 12.
[160:51.24]The age just kept on getting higher and higher.
[160:55.66]I don't know.
[160:56.04]This guy just came over and said a bunch of things to me and then ran away.
[160:58.48]He gave me a radio or something.
[161:13.00]Did that guy just get hit by a barrel?
[161:14.28]Yeah, he did.
[161:17.46]That guy just screamed because he got hit by a barrel.
[161:24.66]Did you hear that?
[161:26.44]He was just like, ah!
[161:30.37]I got a long way to go.
[161:37.95]Now you can call in a buddy.
[161:50.21]Why wouldn't he come with me?
[161:52.21]I mean, why would he give me the radio and just stay with me for a little bit, dude?
[161:55.29]I could use some company.
[161:56.37]Hang out with me.
[161:58.43]Just hang out with me, dude.
[162:01.29]Is there a reason why you won't hang out with me?
[162:05.54]That's a dire wolf.
[162:12.84]I don't want to fight you.
[162:14.11]There's a lot of them.
[162:14.69]There's like five of them.
[162:19.65]I technically don't think I have to go this way.
[162:22.95]No, we're not going to go this way.
[162:23.97]It's going to get me killed.
[162:29.71]I'm going to go up on the rocks.
[162:42.47]There we are.
[162:44.77]Just like that, we avoided the conflict.
[162:53.25]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[162:57.26]Huh?
[163:04.92]Where is this person shooting from?
[163:06.69]Ah, it's going to break my legs.
[163:16.31]I can't do this.
[163:20.00]That's still going to break my legs.
[163:21.56]Unless I can just slide down.
[163:23.20]I think that works.
[163:34.20]Perfect.
[163:35.86]There it is.
[163:36.22]I can see the casino from here.
[163:37.14]I can see it.
[163:39.66]You think there was somebody shooting the wolves?
[163:48.64]Yeah, it probably was.
[163:53.37]Am I gonna play around with mods?
[163:55.05]Yeah, maybe.
[163:55.52]I might just go total batshit crazy tomorrow or something.
[164:00.18]We'll find out.
[164:00.74]These guys hurt.
[164:12.47]Isn't that the guy that gave me the radio?
[164:15.79]That is.
[164:16.11]That's the guy that gave me the radio.
[164:19.44]He is seeing better days.
[164:25.99]Why is his leg broken?
[164:30.89]Sometimes people just don't make any sense in this game.
[164:39.74]Looks like a zombie.
[164:44.00]I'm gonna track him down.
[164:44.84]I'm faster than him.
[164:45.52]I'll be able to catch up to him soon.
[164:50.26]Eventually I will catch up to him even though he's going so fast.
[164:55.60]There was a whistle in this game.
[165:00.18]Can I just whistle him over here?
[165:06.26]You know what?
[165:06.66]I'm done with you.
[165:08.56]I'm just done with that guy.
[165:12.99]So, the casino... is over here somewhere.
[165:24.27]Kill him and take his hat.
[165:28.34]No.
[165:28.52]I already have a hat.
[165:31.36]I don't need to, uh... take a dude's hat off.
[165:40.32]Um... I don't really know where I'm supposed to be going here.
[165:43.24]I mean, I guess the marker right there, but... Can I get around, or do I have to go around the other way?
[165:50.30]Oh, you know, I could just, uh... I could just phase into this and walk up there.
[165:56.96]Alright.
[165:57.42]Everybody...
[166:00.46]Everybody close your eyes.
[166:01.48]Okay, close your eyes.
[166:07.10]On the count of three, close your eyes.
[166:08.58]Ready?
[166:09.84]I'm gonna do a magic trick.
[166:33.58]Spartan Cupcake 9.
[166:34.70]Welcome back for two months.
[166:41.25]Thank you.
[166:41.81]It won't work.
[166:47.59]They load as separate entities.
[166:52.72]Gunrunners.
[166:57.40]Dismiss all companions.
[166:58.64]I don't have any companions.
[167:00.85]Welcome, sir or madam.
[167:02.87]Do you wish to purchase something?
[167:05.01]I never did count to three.
[167:05.71]Yeah, what does he got for sale?
[167:10.63]Magnum rounds.
[167:11.35]This dude's packing, huh?
[167:17.34]Um... Vermont rifle.
[167:29.20]Recon armor.
[167:32.25]That's real expensive.
[167:33.05]I don't want to spend any money.
[167:34.55]I want to be able to go to the casino.
[167:40.22]Jesus.
[167:42.38]When would you ever have 3,600 caps in this game?
[167:50.45]I don't even know how that's possible.
[167:56.14]Can I please open my, yeah, okay, one, two, three, open your eyes.
[168:07.43]Well, there's Jerma's love child.
[168:11.37]I guess that's, uh, my love child decided to show up.

[168:21.21]That's a, that's a five, that's a five dollar joke.
[168:27.36]Okay, so I need... What do I actually need?
[168:32.34]I really don't know.
[168:38.63]I don't think I'm ever going to use this.
[168:40.01]I really don't.
[168:45.01]I'm just going to get rid of it.
[168:45.99]I'm never going to use a small gun like this.
[168:48.63]I'd rather just take the money.
[168:51.41]Just sell it all.
[169:01.20]What else?
[169:05.06]Get rid of that.
[169:09.22]This guy sells fist weapons.
[169:10.54]Unfortunately, those are unarmed.
[169:12.22]So I don't have, um... I don't have any way to use it.
[169:18.02]Bam!
[169:20.58]That is another subscription.

[170:10.64]Ah, no.
[170:11.70]That's a huge... That's a big payday.
[170:13.40]I'm getting rid of it.

[173:21.14]No, something is happening here.
[173:24.25]Where's everybody going?
[173:27.39]Whoa!
[173:28.73]What?
[173:29.67]Why?
[173:30.09]Why?
[173:33.97]What did I do?
[173:36.39]I didn't do anything.
[173:38.60]I was running around in circles.
[173:43.15]Buddy, look.
[173:48.68]Don't want to kill you.
[173:49.50]I don't want to kill you.
[173:50.24]I don't want to kill you.
[173:51.72]I don't... I didn't want to do that.
[173:57.22]Dude was holding a pool cue.
[174:01.49]And you wanted to fight me?
[174:11.00]You never walk up to a guy with a giant piece of concrete on a pole with a pool cue.
[174:16.25]Reach for the sky, mister.
[174:19.75]Give me that gun.
[174:20.93]Sorry, but I need to shoot Stacy.
[174:24.87]Uh... Give me the gun.
[174:26.83]This is the best gun in the whole galaxy.
[174:30.45]I paid a million caps for it.
[174:33.71]Yeah, but your heavy use has really depreciated its value.
[174:36.47]It's only worth 20 caps now.
[174:37.92]It's worth a thousand.
[174:39.94]What a dumbass.
[174:42.85]It's like a break.
[174:51.53]So what did I get?
[174:54.29]Some weird little dinky kids pistol?
[174:56.98]Plasma pistol?
[174:57.82]20 caps?
[175:00.80]It's a steal.
[175:01.74]Thanks, little boy.
[175:02.40]Thanks, little guy.
[175:08.25]Thanks, little young adult.
[175:13.21]Let's keep going.
[175:16.29]What's the best gun in the game?
[175:20.53]Well, we'll see about that.
[175:27.22]It becomes one of the best guns in the game.
[175:32.38]What's this giant rat?
[175:36.66]That was a very loud noise.
[175:46.65]What kind of people are these?
[175:47.73]They're running around chasing rats.
[175:50.19]Kids are fighting each other.
[175:51.21]Random guys with pool cues come up and try to kill you.
[176:03.45]You're the smartest person I've ever seen in a Fallout game.
[176:06.85]Ever.
[176:08.00]He turned around.
[176:09.38]They never turn around.
[176:11.46]They always look straight ahead.
[176:12.86]And you can be hidden and take everything.
[176:14.10]You are...
[176:16.34]A diamond in the rough here, man.
[176:20.42]Have a good day.
[176:21.50]See, you don't deserve to have anything taken from you.
[176:25.34]Respect.
[176:25.74]Uh, should I not have gone out that way?
[176:42.35]I don't think I should have gone that way.
[176:49.23]Watch yourself around here.
[176:53.19]Is it the Greases?
[176:57.60]Are these the Jets?
[177:01.26]Hey, man.
[177:01.94]What are you up to?
[177:06.80]Oh, a gambler.
[177:09.90]Gambler, gambler, gambler.
[177:11.26]This gentleman and I were just settling on a price.
[177:13.90]I'm afraid you'll have to hire one of the...
[177:15.80]You want to travel to Freeside with ease, you hire a... Your safety is practically guaranteed.
[177:24.16]Hold on, I need to have him say that again.
[177:26.12]Give me a second, I need to make sure he says that again.
[177:30.53]You want to travel to Freeside with ease, you hire a king.
[177:34.41]We're everywhere, and no one messes with us.
[177:37.73]Your safety is practically guaranteed for just 100 caps.
[177:41.33]Guaranteed safety.
[177:43.48]Great.
[177:44.28]As long as you're in Freeside, I'll be hanging out by side.
[177:46.66]It'll be a blast.
[177:48.14]It'll be a blast.
[177:48.88]As long as you're in Freeside.
[177:50.28]You leave, and you'll find me gone as well.
[177:53.12]So we're... Nice.
[177:57.08]My safety is guaranteed, guys.
[177:59.14]You heard him.
[177:59.62]When you first order a business, is distract this guy.
[178:07.13]Yeah.
[178:07.65]Uh...
[178:15.05]I wish there was a wait command.
[178:18.61]It's working.
[178:19.57]It's working.
[178:21.01]It's working.
[178:22.79]It's not working.
[178:24.21]Hello.
[178:28.15]Come on, it was working!
[178:30.89]It was working!
[178:32.21]It was working!
[178:33.90]It was working!
[178:37.98]Ugh, let's go.
[178:38.64]It's gonna be a blast.
[178:46.97]Okay, where to?
[178:49.89]This way?
[178:56.38]Just spawn more sugar bombs.
[178:57.82]That's the way to do it.
[179:00.10]Alright, so what is over here that I need to interact with?
[179:03.72]Because this is a door.
[179:08.36]It didn't look like a fucking door.
[179:12.88]Stick with my buddy?
[179:13.84]Good.
[179:14.76]Can't wait to fuck some people up with this guy.
[179:16.50]It's going to be amazing.
[179:19.76]Can I get like ten of you guys to follow me around?
[179:21.54]There it is.
[179:22.50]Unsavory guys?
[179:24.75]It's alright.
[179:27.25]I got my unsavory guy.
[179:28.73]Let's get in here.
[179:29.51]This is going to be great.
[179:42.28]I used to guard at the gate.
[179:44.61]There's no money in it these days.
[179:46.45]I like these guys.
[179:47.21]What do we have here?
[179:48.63]Another petitioner for the king?
[179:50.13]I don't like this guy.
[179:51.69]This guy doesn't sound like he speaks like this normally.
[179:56.51]I'd like to see the king, please.
[179:57.47]Anything's possible, I suppose.
[180:00.65]Sixty?
[180:04.09]Sixty speech?
[180:05.99]That's five.
[180:06.81]What do I look like, a beggar to you?
[180:09.05]Only the big-name guards get any business.
[180:13.67]I want to see the king!
[180:14.45]Damn it, how much speech do I have?
[180:19.73]I'm not paying 500 caps.
[180:21.27]50.
[180:27.74]I need to level up again.
[180:28.82]How close am I?
[180:30.70]Yeah, pretty far away.
[180:40.07]Sleep for like four hours or something.
[180:44.10]No clip in there.
[180:46.94]What happens if I do that?
[180:50.68]Do they even care?
[180:51.64]I wonder if they even care.
[180:54.28]Do you think they care?
[180:55.15]Let's find out.
[181:00.87]No cheating.
[181:01.37]I saw it.
[181:02.27]I just want to see.
[181:03.49]I just want to take a look.
[181:04.53]I just want to see what's in there.
[181:08.26]Okay.
[181:12.12]Okay, this is an odd picture Why is this behind a locked door?
[181:19.82]Some random guy singing to one person in the audience and his clone is sitting in this seat smoking What a secret What a fucking secret, huh?
[181:32.17]It's not even worth going in there
[181:42.19]I was looking through the keyhole.
[181:43.55]Hi.
[181:48.73]You wanted something?
[181:55.47]Where am I going?
[181:57.19]This way.
[182:02.47]You can get the dog.
[182:06.34]Sp-
[182:07.41]Oh, okay, fine.
[182:09.15]God, you guys are giving me these fucking things to do in the chat.
[182:13.61]The guy's singing on the stage.
[182:15.59]Deathclaw's gonna go in there.
[182:21.34]He's gonna be real surprised about that, isn't he?
[182:30.30]Okay.
[182:30.70]This is gonna be funny.
[182:37.03]Wait, did I save it?
[182:38.37]Let me save it.
[182:42.66]Save it.
[182:57.78]Is this right?
[182:58.52]Somebody just put one in.
[183:01.81]I'm gonna believe this guy.
[183:21.41]Fucking ten easy beats.
[183:27.56]That was great.
[183:38.58]Who just did that?
[183:42.15]That was unbelievable.
[183:43.17]That was really funny.
[183:44.01]Howdy.
[183:47.23]Bad trouble.
[183:49.21]Fuckin' EZ Pete.
[183:52.39]Uh... What's wrong with that EZ Pete?
[184:02.82]Why'd the skin come off?
[184:25.06]crying oh
[184:57.03]Why is this happening?
[184:58.41]I lost all control
[185:31.84]Why?
[185:32.16]Why are they doing that?
[185:35.89]I don't know.
[185:41.29]I don't get it.
[186:03.76]I don't understand.
[186:04.66]I can't do it.
[186:06.04]I have to stop.
[186:07.42]Fuck, I'm sorry.
[186:37.18]There are fucking boogers coming out of my nose.
[186:39.54]It's just fucking boogers.
[186:41.32]There's snot everywhere.
[186:43.38]I'm dead.
[186:44.36]Did it happen to me, too?
[186:45.24]Did it happen to me?
[186:51.35]Oh, God.
[186:54.37]Oh, my God.
[187:01.02]To the guy that made me spawn the easy peats, like, that was...
[187:06.95]That was all you, man.
[187:07.77]Oh my god, that was unbelievable.
[187:16.47]Un-fucking-believable.
[187:19.33]Hey.
[187:20.09]There's still no clipping.
[187:21.19]I need to, like, take- I need to take a second.
[187:26.11]I need to take at least a few seconds after that one, man.
[187:28.20]My whole body hurts.
[187:40.94]God.
[187:41.14]That was so worth it.
[187:49.67]Yeah, I am recording all this, by the way.
[187:52.63]So... I mean, people have to see that.
[188:02.74]Suck.
[188:06.80]A lot of closed casket funerals.
[188:16.90]I am covered in fluid right now.
[188:18.58]Like, I spit all over myself.
[188:22.31]Should we do it again?
[188:22.93]Are we gonna do it again?
[188:26.45]I don't know if I can do it again, but I think we're gonna have to try and do it again.
[188:31.17]Only this time.
[188:34.05]We need to spawn, like... We need to spawn, like, fucking 100 EZP's.
[188:39.55]Fucking, like, at least 40.
[188:46.49]You know, this kind of has to happen, you know?
[188:50.59]So, we're gonna give it a try.
[188:58.92]Stop!
[188:59.54]Stop!
[189:04.95]I don't, it's too laggy.
[189:06.49]It's a little too laggy.
[189:08.57]Ah, fuck, the game crashed.
[189:18.76]Game crashed.
[189:22.48]Thank you, Jack's Loony Bin.
[189:23.88]This really is the fucking Loony Bin.
[189:27.66]We've lost, the program's gone.
[189:31.74]Ah, my lord.
[189:41.21]I have to, like, reload this.
[189:42.23]Hold on.
[189:46.47]That hurt.
[189:47.39]That hurt.
[189:48.65]That hurt.
[189:50.73]That hurt me just watching it.
[189:56.20]It did.
[189:56.56]Oh, it did.
[189:59.38]Man.
[190:01.80]I can't get out of this now.
[190:02.66]I'm going to have to, like, end the stream.
[190:08.04]Jeez.
[190:08.38]Jeez.
[190:14.59]Alright, I need to, I need to, like, take a second.
[190:17.31]I seriously am going to die.
[190:18.27]I really think I might die after that one.
[190:23.02]So, I'm going to take a quick pee break.
[190:25.02]I'm going to get a drink.
[190:26.34]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[190:29.23]I'll be right back.
[192:42.01]Oh boy.
[192:46.17]I still can't get over it.
[192:48.61]I'm still having trouble getting over that.
[192:52.55]That is like one of the funniest things I've seen in probably like at least a couple months.
[192:59.15]You turn them into like silly putty and you hit them with the mallet for some reason.
[193:03.69]I don't know why, but we have to keep with the scientific reasonings.
[193:07.80]We have to keep going on that.
[193:11.74]And Sebex!
[193:12.60]Sebex, my CLR is not logged in right now.
[193:16.20]But Sebex, that's seven months.
[193:18.60]Oh, God.
[193:19.84]And GoYardBelt just subscribed too, but you didn't pop up on the screen.
[193:22.80]I'm sorry, guys.
[193:23.32]I have to, like, reload the game and everything.
[193:32.75]P is still going.
[193:35.83]But I hope that reloading and crashing didn't make it so that's not going to happen anymore.
[193:42.68]Cause my goodness.
[193:48.44]It's right here.
[193:49.10]Alright.
[193:57.54]Bring this back over.
[194:00.12]So yes to both of you guys.
[194:01.44]Do you hear how like fucking messed up my voice is right now?
[194:05.44]Do you hear this shit?
[194:09.07]I can barely even talk.
[194:11.56]But thank you, Sebix and GoYardBelt, both of you.
[194:14.40]Sebix especially.
[194:15.14]That's seven months in a row.
[194:17.36]You're a great dude, man.
[194:18.78]Thanks.
[194:19.06]I appreciate it.
[194:23.08]Well, there's definitely going to be a Fallout New Vegas video.
[194:25.62]I can guarantee you that.
[194:28.02]From what happened like last night and the stupid shit that's happening now.
[194:31.00]Guarantee it.
[194:35.06]So let me pull this back up.
[194:38.12]Apologize for the slight delay here.
[194:44.99]That hurt me watching it.
[194:48.44]Yeah.
[194:48.76]I, I'm going to throw a grenade into the easy pizza and we're going to see if we can make like a person stew.
[194:52.80]Okay.
[194:57.42]Let me just lower this.
[195:03.19]And that should do it.
[195:07.91]Theoretically.
[195:13.52]Alright, let's go back to play.
[195:19.17]How lucky can one guy be?
[195:22.99]I have such loud ass pees.
[195:27.29]Okay.
[195:28.81]God.
[195:29.17]This is what happens every time I laugh this hard.
[195:35.85]Always seems to happen when I go into this room.
[195:39.11]So.
[195:40.79]It was... What was peed again?
[195:49.42]Claymation with EZPete.
[195:53.07]0-0.
[195:54.37]1... What was it?
[195:59.79]You're not even playing the game anymore?
[196:01.15]Well, this is like how I have my fun in games.
[196:03.77]I... Okay, so like this whole stream, right?
[196:08.09]I played Fallout New Vegas.
[196:10.12]I played the game for a little bit.
[196:11.40]I did some quests.
[196:13.42]And then we fucking turned EZPete into Silly Putty.
[196:15.66]And it was like fucking 10,000 times more fun.
[196:21.49]So what is EZP again?
[196:27.73]E4, C2.
[196:28.19]Is this it?
[196:32.23]Let's just make sure.
[196:33.81]No, these are bots.
[196:34.67]These are like robots.
[196:42.67]I'm kind of scared.
[196:46.29]We'll just hit them once and see what happens.
[196:50.41]He's not doing anything.
[196:51.29]I'm falling through the sky.
[197:02.39]Now that just wasn't called for.
[197:04.97]Oh, that one broke.
[197:07.19]Now that just wasn't called for.
[197:11.00]Now that just wasn't called for.
[197:13.36]Now that just wasn't called for.
[197:15.10]You know what?
[197:16.56]Shut up.
[197:16.82]I'm gonna fucking crush your head like a melon and get like a stage.
[197:31.07]Hey, you know the last time when you died?
[197:32.61]It doesn't even need to be a certain NPC.
[197:34.74]It's an ins- It's an inside-out weapon.
[197:56.45]It's an inside-out weapon.
[198:10.32]What?
[198:12.48]It just took his arm off when he went to sleep.
[198:20.55]He turned into Zoidberg.
[198:28.45]What am I holding in my hand?
[198:35.48]Will it work on a Deathclaw?
[198:37.14]I don't know.
[198:37.86]What's God Mode?
[198:39.26]God Mode is enabled.
[198:42.07]Alright.
[198:43.71]Let's do some more testing here.
[198:54.01]Mr. Deluge.
[198:55.41]Thank you so much, man.
[198:56.29]Welcome, Mr. Deluge.
[198:58.86]Okay, player.
[199:01.54]Place at me.
[199:02.52]00167.
[199:02.54]EC1.
[199:15.17]Okay, that's a death block.
[199:20.94]Let's see what happens when he dies.
[199:22.16]It's gonna take a little while.
[199:28.34]I swear to God, if this guy turns into like a fucking cheese pizza when I kill him, I'm gonna die.
[199:41.17]Whoa!
[199:44.84]They just turned into a fucking museum statue.
[199:48.89]Look at this.
[199:50.31]Look at this guy's face.
[199:55.58]Look at this guy's face.
[200:00.56]He can't believe it.
[200:01.83]He can't fucking believe it.
[200:14.30]You can't fucking believe it.
[200:32.13]Is this guy still alive?
[200:33.63]This has to be the thumbnail.
[200:39.11]This HAS to be the thumbnail.
[200:40.57]How do I turn off the HUD?
[200:42.76]This guy's just like, I can't fucking believe it.
[200:52.83]There's gotta be a way to turn the HUD off, right?
[200:57.15]What's like, turn off HUD?
[201:05.20]TM and console.
[201:07.52]Okay, here we go.
[201:22.42]It's good right there.
[201:23.30]I went through him.
[201:49.00]I can't do anything.
[201:50.80]I stuffed his head into his shoulders.
[201:52.36]Where's TM?
[201:55.50]TM.
[201:56.66]Okay, good.
[202:02.22]Look at his hand.
[202:07.34]Oh.
[202:15.00]God, I keep sinking into the ground.
[202:19.18]Zima Zhang, thank you for subscribing.
[202:21.44]Welcome.
[202:28.56]This is unreal.
[202:31.23]This shit is fucking unreal.
[202:32.69]It's a time gun.
[202:35.15]I don't have any words.
[202:36.31]There's no words to explain it.
[202:38.65]I'm freezing them in time and ripping their bodies in...
[203:08.82]Whoa!
[203:12.44]What?
[203:14.04]I think I found the secret.
[203:16.66]If you turn... Uh-oh.
[203:18.34]I think I might have broke it.
[203:19.12]I don't think it's gonna happen anymore.
[203:29.27]I get it.
[203:30.45]I think I get it.
[203:33.25]I have to be flying.
[203:37.88]Hold on, hold on.
[203:39.64]I hope we didn't just ruin it.
[203:41.76]I hope we didn't ruin it.
[203:46.80]It might be ruined.
[203:48.46]I think the bug that was causing all these problems might have just solved itself.
[203:56.27]It is possible.
[203:59.15]Come on, somewhere.
[203:59.89]Somebody's got to be here.
[204:00.53]Okay.
[204:06.56]That was so worth it.
[204:09.70]Come here, you fuck.
[204:13.14]This is the king.
[204:20.34]It's working.
[204:24.06]Oh...
[204:37.27]Oh, that doesn't look like fun.
[204:40.18]RIP fun.
[204:44.48]No, fun still goes.
[204:45.52]Yeah.
[204:49.68]Alright.
[204:55.33]I'm going to do the voice for this guy.
[204:57.55]Yeah.
[205:00.83]Now, very important.
[205:02.33]I'm going to do this one more time.
[205:06.82]one more time we're gonna get what what is an enemy in this game that has a ton of like long limbs or a bunch of particle effects inside of its body you know what I'm saying I'm talking the lankiest fucking lurch motherfucker that's in this game because it will just it will go everywhere
[205:39.37]Centaur?
[205:40.77]Alright, what's the centaur?
[205:49.53]Give me the code for the centaur.
[205:50.89]I'm putting down 12 of them.
[205:51.87]Or at least 20.
[205:52.56]0, 0.
[205:52.60]0, 0, 1.
[206:06.10]I just missed it.
[206:06.60]001... Shit, people are putting so many codes.
[206:10.54]Okay, I need a mod to do this, because this is important.
[206:13.90]If you're a mod and you know what it is, let me see it.
[206:28.81]People didn't want him to cheat.
[206:37.56]I don't think centaurs are in New Vegas.
[206:39.18]They might be.
[206:44.60]Save us mods.
[206:47.63]Where are my mods?
[206:48.45]They're gone forever.
[206:49.31]There we go, Cevix.
[206:51.47]001567... 156789, really?
[206:52.49]Seems really stupid.
[207:07.58]Okay, this is gonna be odd.
[207:09.76]Alright, here we go.
[207:14.04]I probably shouldn't have put 20 of them here.
[207:15.60]It's gonna take a long time to kill one.
[207:29.60]This guy is already dead.
[207:33.42]That guy already died.
[207:35.87]He didn't make it.
[207:42.49]Oh god, I'm losing track.
[207:50.45]I kind of just want to watch them die.
[207:52.07]Like, I'm just gonna watch this guy die.
[207:54.75]Hold on, TM.
[207:57.03]Hey guys, watch this, he said.
[208:03.63]Come on.
[208:14.63]Killed that one.
[208:15.39]He actually killed him.
[208:35.01]Come on.
[208:42.89]Kill the other one.
[208:43.91]Kill the other one.
[208:50.76]Why are you so good?
[208:51.72]Are you seriously this good?
[208:55.96]Fuck you, stop being such a good shot.
[208:59.40]What?
[209:02.83]What the fuck?
[209:05.27]No way.
[209:08.29]No fucking way.
[209:09.53]Alright, this guy.
[209:15.61]Let's go spit at him.
[209:18.59]Kill him with that spit.
[209:20.87]Fucking spit in his face and have him turn into a fucking horror movie.
[209:28.69]These things suck.
[209:32.86]Please hit him right in the face.
[209:34.28]Hit him right in his fucking face.
[209:40.70]Look, what are these dodges?
[209:41.81]They're dodging all over the place.
[209:49.26]It's super important that he gets killed by this, but he is so good.
[209:58.16]Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes.
[209:59.16]Come on, come on, come on.
[210:07.10]Moment of truth.
[210:08.18]I didn't mean to die right there.
[210:09.86]Sorry.
[210:13.81]You know, typically I would be upset about this, but you earned it, man.
[210:18.73]You earned it.
[210:19.29]Look at how he just wants a drink.
[210:22.73]You earned it, dude.
[210:24.93]You earned your drink.
[210:30.04]Bottoms up.
[210:39.82]I don't want your fucking silly mods.
[210:43.70]There is no mods.
[210:45.54]There are not any mods installed right now, guys.
[210:48.50]That's the thing.
[210:50.30]This is totally modless.
[210:59.76]Reload, reload, reload.
[211:01.32]We're going to try something else.
[211:04.96]We're going to spawn like a hundred people and then just drop a new gun on them.
[211:15.10]Still gonna drop a nuke.
[211:18.06]Just a bunch of non-hostiles.
[211:20.40]What is a non-hostile?
[211:25.75]Hey.
[211:30.89]Like, play your place at me.
[211:32.51]Just... Something having a good-ass time.
[211:38.00]Somebody just standing around.
[211:41.41]Easy Pete.
[211:42.07]We could do Easy Pete.
[211:43.27]We already did Easy Pete, though.
[211:44.37]I feel like he's got me.
[211:46.79]He's got me.
[211:50.75]We're going to do this, and then we're done.
[211:51.85]Then we're going to move on.
[211:59.56]I'm going to try to get, like, up somewhere around 100 people in the room.
[212:04.56]We're going to do it, like, 20 at a time.
[212:14.25]0, 0, 1.
[212:16.11]God, he's screaming by right now.
[212:20.85]They all start with 0, 0.
[212:26.52]0, 0, 10.
[212:28.82]1, C, B, 9, B.
[212:30.52]1, C, 9, B. Okay, I have no idea who this is.
[212:42.25]This is a bunch of Gary's?
[212:44.91]Who the hell is this?
[212:48.04]Okay.
[212:49.38]I think we can handle maybe like another ten Gary's.
[212:54.22]Yeah.
[212:54.94]We're gonna do ten more Gary's.
[212:59.94]That's all I'm gonna be able to handle.
[213:02.08]Give me a rocket launcher and we're going to blow up this place to fucking absolute hell.
[213:11.94]Because my frame rate already is at like 25.
[213:14.02]So... Give me the weapon.
[213:21.58]Give me the weapon, Gary.
[213:24.32]Fill the room?
[213:24.97]I don't think you understand.
[213:26.11]I don't think I can.
[213:27.49]And I'm streaming too, guys.
[213:32.85]So it's just chugging along.
[213:36.45]Last tenth.
[213:39.11]That's it.
[213:40.17]That's all I'm going to be able to handle.
[213:42.44]Before my computer explodes.
[213:45.74]What's the fat man code?
[213:47.70]Because I'm going to have god mode on, right?
[213:49.46]Alright, I'm in god mode.
[213:53.49]We're going to make modern art.
[214:03.34]I believe I also missed a couple of subscribers.
[214:05.92]That was Happy Pants.
[214:06.78]Thanks.
[214:07.08]Welcome, Happy Pants.
[214:09.02]Then Galaxy Fantasy for two months a few minutes ago, I believe I missed.
[214:13.51]Thanks to both of yous.
[214:15.75]Much love, dudes.
[214:18.39]Alright.
[214:20.21]000432C.
[214:21.95]Now, what's the actual command?
[214:26.99]You know, actually, I might just look this up because it's going to be going too fast for me.
[214:31.00]Give me one second, dudes.
[214:34.61]Well, I figure out the exact fucking code.
[214:45.16]What's it called?
[214:45.52]The Fat Man?
[214:46.04]I'm going to just copy and paste it.
[214:53.10]I'm just going to scroll up.
[214:57.39]I think Hypo said it or Ronnie said it.
[215:00.91]Yeah, there it is.
[215:04.85]So is it spawn item or is it just still place at me?
[215:07.07]Oh, I can't paste that?
[215:20.98]Fuck.
[215:24.06]I can put it in here and just look at it.
[215:33.63]0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, C. Okay, there's Fat Man.
[215:46.99]Fat Man.
[215:47.43]Is there any bullets in it?
[215:49.47]No.
[215:49.61]Okay, what's the ammo?
[215:50.49]4, 2, C, and 1.
[215:51.67]Okay, 207, 9, 9.
[215:52.63]207, 9, 9.
[216:09.23]Whoops, two... Oh, shit.
[216:15.80]Near the nukes.
[216:17.46]Okay.
[216:19.80]Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a pleasure streaming, but I'm not entirely sure this is going to last.
[216:27.27]So, get your cameras ready.
[216:29.01]Like, get ready.
[216:30.49]I'm turning off my HUD.
[216:31.57]I have no idea what's going to happen here.
[216:36.39]But something horrible is going to happen.
[216:37.81]That's all I know.
[216:40.27]It's been real.
[216:42.45]It's been fucking real.
[216:45.25]But, goodbye.
[216:47.13]Goodbye.
[216:57.95]Uh... We're still... going.
[217:17.44]That didn't hurt anybody.
[217:19.83]That didn't do anything.
[217:20.99]That didn't do anything.
[217:26.75]And now my frames are crushed.
[217:31.91]Do you see how slow this is going?
[217:39.92]No, no, no, no, get me out!
[217:41.34]Looks like it never happened.
[217:48.34]Damn it.
[217:54.67]Turn off TLC?
[217:55.47]I can't.
[217:56.05]If I turn TLC off, it'll, uh, it won't happen.
[218:00.25]The people don't turn into freak shows.
[218:05.93]Alright.
[218:13.20]I don't think Benny can die.
[218:15.21]Benny is invincible.
[218:19.81]I'll try it one more time.
[218:22.01]I'll try it one more time.
[218:23.91]Oppo 090.
[218:25.07]Oppo Oppo.
[218:25.89]I believe that's how you're saying your name.
[218:26.95]Two months.
[218:27.29]Thanks, man.
[218:27.77]Welcome back.
[218:30.77]Yeah, we're going to do... We'll try again.
[218:38.85]Who's the weakest NPC in the game that has two health?
[218:43.82]You know what I'm saying?
[218:45.30]Who's like a weak-ass motherfucker in this game?
[218:50.40]That is guaranteed to die from that explosion.
[219:01.32]Easy Pete.
[219:08.04]Easy Pete.
[219:08.79]Are we really gonna just nuke Easy Pete?
[219:11.97]Alright, what is Easy Pete?
[219:12.93]We'll try Easy Pete.
[219:19.44]Need to use a grenade launcher.
[219:21.40]Okay.
[219:21.56]I'm going to do that.
[219:23.54]Somebody just said that because you're doing the TLC, the bomb actually, like, you need to do, like, a grenade launcher.
[219:34.65]I would love if one of the mods could put in the grenade launcher code.
[219:39.43]That would be great.
[219:41.35]I would love you.
[219:43.35]So much.
[219:46.62]Alright, easy peat.
[219:48.20]One, one, one, three, two, four.

[221:14.44]We have to do it.
[221:15.28]Alright, I see another one.
[221:26.41]I think that actually is Easy Pete.
[221:33.21]That's not Easy Pete either!
[221:34.31]That's not Easy Pete!
[221:37.71]Oh God, this is like nudity.
[221:39.25]Oh God, nudity.
[221:48.24]Okay, that was not easy Pete.

[222:28.11]Thank you, Hypo.
[222:32.75]Okay, let's spawn him.

[223:34.91]I need a grenade launcher.
[223:39.25]Give me a grenade launcher.
[223:42.09]And we can end this madness.
[223:47.17]I swear to God, his hat is making this worse.
[223:52.87]His hat is making this worse, I guarantee it.
[223:54.37]What's with this fucking smoke?
[223:57.03]Why is this place on fire?
[223:58.16]7EA25.
[224:13.17]There it is.

[224:17.24]Easy Pete, you fucking dumbass hat.

[224:23.00]Captain Schneider for three months.
[224:24.52]Thank you.
[224:24.88]I miss somebody else too.
[224:25.98]I'll make sure to go back and look.
[224:26.88]Why are they all going over there?
[224:32.20]Stop going in that fucking corner, you dummies.
[224:35.92]And what was the ammo?
[224:40.10]It was ammo too.
[224:43.62]I'm gonna have to... Ronnie, if you could do that again for me.
[224:51.12]Easypeen ain't gonna die like a bitch.
[224:53.02]He's gonna crash the game.
[224:54.25]He probably will.
[224:54.93]26, okay.
[224:59.11]Plus, they keep talking, too.
[225:09.22]It's the fact that they keep speaking...
[225:12.40]Shut up, Pete.
[225:13.56]You're really fucking this up for me.
[225:18.64]Ugh.
[225:20.76]Ugh, it's chugging.
[225:23.92]Ugh.
[225:25.50]Come on.
[225:27.12]Come on.
[225:29.28]Come on.
[225:32.71]Hey, hello, hey.
[225:35.11]Hey.
[225:37.07]Okay, I think it's six is enough.
[225:39.97]It's because they... Okay, I got my frames back.
[225:43.97]Alright.
[225:45.65]Here we go.
[225:48.85]This is important.
[225:50.45]Alright, guys.
[225:57.04]Let's see what happens when we do this.
[225:58.86]This is gonna be a mess.
[226:01.60]Game crashed.
[226:02.22]Uh-oh.
[226:15.09]I can already see his broken neck.
[226:27.76]This is a spider on the screen.
[226:32.64]I don't think it's good.
[226:46.04]Do you see?
[226:47.34]Do you see the back row?
[226:49.50]The back row, they're all holding each other's shoulder.
[226:53.05]They're all holding each other's shoulder in the back row.
[227:01.77]I gotta collect myself.
[227:03.17]Because that's really, really fucking funny.
[227:14.56]I can't even shoot.
[227:15.54]There we go.
[227:15.90]I think I shot again.
[227:16.44]One of them.
[227:36.19]How are they still alive?
[227:39.60]How are you still alive?
[227:42.20]It's not even possible.
[227:47.82]I just shot another grenade.
[227:57.70]I want to move, but I can't.
[227:59.10]There's nowhere to move.
[228:01.18]Okay, we're slowly slideshowing in.
[228:10.05]I think they're all dead here.
[228:11.01]I'm pretty sure they're all dead.
[228:15.66]Yeah, they're all dead.
[228:17.91]The only difference is they have their arms up.
[228:23.59]Ugh.
[228:26.71]They're either... Look at the... All the eyes closed.
[228:30.02]They didn't even explode.
[228:30.82]They just went to sleep.
[228:35.08]Gray screen.
[228:38.68]Um... Video card may have just shit the bed.
[228:46.71]I might have just shit my video cards bad.
[228:59.14]I'm kind of just going to let this play out for a second.
[229:05.14]Just for a second or two.
[229:12.52]Okay, so we're going to have to restart again.
[229:14.31]I apologize.
[229:17.33]I apologize in advance.
[229:20.55]Wait a minute!
[229:20.89]I just saw a dog!
[229:22.73]What was that dog?
[229:24.51]Where?
[229:24.79]Oh, it's swimming.
[229:25.65]I'm swimming.
[229:28.02]Wait a second.
[229:37.00]I knew I should have let it play out.
[229:38.31]What if I... I'm going to walk out of the door.
[229:43.21]I'll make it.
[229:43.81]I'm gonna make it.
[229:44.23]I'm gonna make it.
[229:44.61]I'm gonna make it.
[229:44.97]I'm gonna make it.
[229:46.73]This was the gray screen.
[229:47.91]The gray screen was just being outside.
[229:49.51]I thought my video card crashed.
[229:52.87]Can I get to escape?
[229:54.29]Can I get to escape?
[229:55.33]Escape, escape, escape.
[229:56.29]Come on.
[229:57.63]Come on.
[229:58.89]Quick load of save.
[229:59.83]That's what I'm trying to do.
[230:00.77]I have to like catch it at the right second.
[230:06.09]Oh, I almost had it.
[230:11.03]This song in the background.
[230:17.25]Press E on the door.
[230:23.57]There's no getting out of this.
[230:26.09]Wait.
[230:30.57]There might be a way out.
[230:39.01]Come on.
[230:39.87]Uh, yep.
[230:40.59]That's a good idea.
[230:41.49]If I TLC, maybe everyone will just fall on the ground.
[230:47.93]Ah, I almost had it.
[230:54.95]Come on, you shitty.
[230:56.77]You shithead.
[230:58.99]Take it easy, Jerma, for Pete's sake.
[231:02.79]Easy Pete's right leg.
[231:12.33]Easy Pete's left leg.
[231:17.16]Easy, easy.
[231:19.16]Right leg.
[231:24.98]I can't get back to the menu.
[231:37.60]I just have to catch it right when it's in the frame.
[231:46.51]For the love of God, I'm just gonna have to force quit.
[231:52.02]Got it!
[231:53.80]T, C, L. Are we back?
[232:00.60]I don't think we're back.
[232:08.77]Oh!
[232:10.53]Oh!
[232:12.99]Oh!
[232:13.17]Oh!
[232:21.08]They're all getting sucked through.
[232:22.25]Got it!
[232:35.31]We're safe.
[232:39.45]Whoever tricked me into spawning 30 ezp's.
[232:44.48]Legit- And you guys didn't want me to fucking cheat.
[232:51.40]Alright, I think that's gonna be it for that.
[232:54.42]I think we're gonna move on.
[232:56.93]We had our silly time.
[232:58.17]That was one of the funniest fucking things I've ever seen.
[233:03.85]But I believe it is now time to continue playing Fallout.
[233:09.46]At least for a little bit.
[233:13.52]What's up?
[233:14.86]Holy shit, that was funny.
[233:24.60]Uh, noclip is off, I believe, right?
[233:27.56]Collision on.
[233:29.78]Guard mode off.
[233:33.64]Okay.
[233:35.30]Where the hell was I going?
[233:37.99]I just have ten more peats.
[233:44.27]We can do ten more peats, maybe.
[233:51.11]God, that was so much fun.
[233:55.36]So it's like sometimes people like wonder, like when I make a video, right?
[234:01.16]That's like the type of shit that'll happen and I will spend that like same amount of time doing that to try to get stupid shit like that to happen.
[234:09.08]So there you go.
[234:09.64]You got to see like an inside of how that actually works sometimes.
[234:14.82]And when you find something that's that fucking ridiculous, you got to play around with it.
[234:20.55]My game is still frame ready, by the way.
[234:28.02]How can you even go back to anything else?
[234:30.18]We've already hit the ceiling.
[234:33.58]Seriously.
[234:35.92]We have already hit the ceiling.
[234:39.17]But there's still more.
[234:40.61]Hey, that's what people might have thought yesterday.
[234:42.39]You probably thought that maybe if you were watching the stream an hour ago.
[234:45.43]Like, ah, we're just playing Fallout.
[234:47.39]Don't ever give up.
[234:48.45]Don't ever give up hope that there's going to be something fucking stupid just around the corner.
[234:53.87]Because most likely, there will be.
[234:57.13]You just have to give it some time.
[235:00.15]Alright, let me look at the subs that I missed.
[235:02.03]I missed, like, at least two or three.
[235:05.31]Which I apologize about that.
[235:06.35]Let's go look who they were.
[235:12.74]It was... I think I didn't miss all of them, but... No, I think I got them.
[235:18.48]HappyPants, Zimazang, MrDeluge, GoyardBelt, JaxLunibin, Opo0900, Silvone.
[235:25.64]Yeah, I got you guys, I think.
[235:29.32]I believe I got you guys.
[235:30.46]I don't think I missed anybody.
[235:34.48]Alright.
[235:35.87]Let's go.
[235:38.67]I was going to the casino and I was going to spend money.
[235:40.45]That's all I remember.
[235:41.09]I think it's this way.
[235:44.07]I'm pretty sure it is just this way.
[235:49.73]Hold on one second.
[235:53.61]One small second.
[236:07.29]Just a second.
[236:10.41]We'll get back to it.
[236:15.55]Alright.
[236:18.43]What's up?
[236:18.87]I'll tell you about this song, though.
[236:19.93]I can't stand this song anymore.
[236:24.57]Gambling is under a sign near you.
[236:30.21]Take it easy, Firestarter.
[236:30.99]Thanks for coming out.
[236:33.36]But when I laugh that hard and when shit goes south like that, my fucking throat is killing me.

[249:09.09]That's when you do a split.
[249:11.95]Split it up, that's five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[249:13.43]Do you want to double down on both of them?
[249:15.77]And then you want to switch hands.
[249:17.81]And you're going to hit here.
[249:18.45]You're going to hit again.
[249:19.67]And then you're going to get the five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen.
[249:23.75]You're going to hit one more time.
