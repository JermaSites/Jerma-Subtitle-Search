[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.59]Hey.
[00:02.57]What's going on, everybody?
[00:03.53]How are you?
[00:06.77]What's the deal?
[00:09.23]Nothing.
[00:10.23]Cool.
[00:13.61]Alright, we've covered that.
[00:14.73]Let's go over what we're doing today.
[00:16.18]Today we're going to be doing... You know what's weird?
[00:19.14]This is the first time I've talked in my clean office.
[00:25.62]I don't like it.
[00:27.14]It's echoey.
[00:28.54]Usually there's a bunch of trash on the ground.
[00:32.44]The trash and CD cases and old video game consoles that took up a majority of the floor and the closet have been sorted.
[00:42.83]They've been put away.
[00:44.77]Now I can hear myself.
[00:46.61]I don't like this.
[00:51.35]Show us the clean office.
[00:55.42]Nah.
[00:56.62]Make it messy again.
[00:58.80]I have those...
[01:01.50]I have a bunch of those bass traps in the corners.
[01:06.06]I've got the foam all over the place.
[01:08.97]My whole wall in front of me is all that audio foam.
[01:13.75]Over here on my right, I got it all over the place.
[01:15.25]Don't matter.
[01:15.71]It's like, you know, anybody that streams on Twitch, they're really looking for the grandma house.
[01:25.68]You know when you go into your grandmother's house and there's just stuff everywhere.
[01:30.42]The house is full of things.
[01:32.66]So the audio quality is incredible in a fucking old grandma house.
[01:41.45]You can hear your grandmother on the phone loud and clear with no echo.
[01:45.05]It's because she has six bureaus in that room.
[01:49.20]And her carpet is... It's like two and a half inches thick.
[01:54.36]long strands and there's probably six or seven coats of wallpaper on the wall I want that house I need that house but that house is like nobody wants to live there but anyways hi how are you we're gonna finish Dead Rising two off the record
[02:19.78]should be fairly simple.
[02:23.20]You know how it is with me.
[02:24.10]We're always very simple.
[02:28.08]It's not going to be.
[02:28.92]Don't worry.
[02:32.53]I think there's only about three to four hours left of this game.
[02:36.71]We'll see.
[02:38.11]But this will be the final Dead Rising-oriented stream for a while.
[02:52.78]No, ever.
[02:53.68]No, not ever.
[02:55.54]I'm going to play Dead Rising 3 eventually.
[02:59.44]Probably like another month or two.
[03:02.42]I don't really want to play that right now.
[03:04.99]Because I've played it before, and I remember it was alright.
[03:08.39]It was fun, I guess.
[03:09.49]It wasn't like these, though.
[03:13.47]But this is the last Dead Rising stream that you're going to get for a while.
[03:17.80]So let's hop right into it.
[03:18.76]Those of you that weren't here before...
[03:21.40]Those of you that have never been here before, hey!
[03:25.28]Appreciate the follow.
[03:29.40]I want to look at this first, though.
[03:37.72]Did I get anything new?
[03:40.07]I have a shitload of time for 8-2.
[03:42.95]That's where we are.
[03:43.61]Where the hell is this guy, even on the cases?
[03:47.63]He's here.
[03:51.11]So we've got a huge amount of time and a day for 8-2, then 8-3, and then the facts, and then overtime.
[04:01.57]The zombie mutating gas seems to be coming from the underground.
[04:04.39]I've got to find the source.
[04:07.63]But take a look.
[04:08.19]I've got a lot... We're not going to let this get to yellow.
[04:12.03]TK is also infected.
[04:13.22]That's the only two things I have right now, though.
[04:21.78]TK needs Zombrex, although I'm not sure he deserves it.
[04:24.00]When do I need Zombrex?
[04:28.38]I'm just gonna go buy one.
[04:29.76]Alright, I'm gonna go buy, like, two Zombrexes from the store.
[04:38.97]I got plenty of good items.
[04:43.33]You still have 21 Kinect games to play.
[04:46.94]Don't think we forgot.
[04:55.90]There's not that many, I can assure you.
[05:01.78]There's probably seven or eight Kinect games.
[05:08.17]Need this neck.
[05:09.97]Alright, this is- why is this so loud for me?
[05:12.75]What's going on here?
[05:14.25]I have to turn this down.
[05:16.57]Why is it so loud for me?
[05:17.79]Is it loud for you?
[05:18.43]No, it should be fine, right?
[05:26.69]Why is it so loud for me?
[05:27.43]I don't know.
[05:30.59]Alright.
[05:32.23]So, uh... What's this magazine?
[05:34.99]Oh, right.
[05:35.41]Edge weapons.
[05:37.17]So these last a lot longer.
[05:38.61]Break this fucking box.
[05:40.04]No, don't want it.
[05:43.82]I've got a good... I don't need to do anything.
[05:45.20]This is great.
[05:46.14]Just go buy Zombrex from the store and end it.
[05:53.24]Oh, shit.
[05:53.70]I forgot they coughed.
[05:56.50]I forgot about the coughing mechanism.
[06:03.85]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[06:08.17]Is it already angry?
[06:12.99]No, I'm fine.
[06:14.39]I just turned it down to like 30%.
[06:15.93]Did my computer get louder in two days?
[06:19.01]Three days?
[06:20.27]What is going on?
[06:28.77]Did I get a Windows update?
[06:31.29]Increased your volume permanently by like 200%.
[06:33.87]Alright, watch out!
[06:34.95]Every time I come in here, these fucking idiots stroll up behind me.
[06:40.64]And they cause a huge problem.
[06:41.80]I'm ready for them.
[06:42.38]And they're not gonna come in this time?
[06:54.83]He's already mad.
[06:55.91]No, I'm not mad.
[06:56.91]Alright, they're not going to come in this time?
[06:59.75]Alright, I'm going to buy Zombrex.
[07:05.39]I was going to buy like three of them.
[07:07.36]How many of these do I need?
[07:08.66]I have tons of money.
[07:11.36]I was going to buy another one.
[07:15.04]I have three now.
[07:15.76]Alright, I'm done.
[07:23.38]Okay, so now I'm going to go to the maintenance place.
[07:27.72]Big bits already.
[07:28.70]That was a pretty good lie.
[07:34.08]Give me the queen.
[07:38.98]Got the queen.
[07:40.92]So now I've got enough zombies.
[07:46.74]TK is infected.
[07:47.92]I had a long time for this.
[07:59.44]Save TK.
[08:01.86]I'm just gonna go do it.
[08:04.81]Right?
[08:05.37]I should just go do this right now.
[08:20.30]I need to do this.
[08:21.16]Well, I mean, I have the opportunity to, so why not just do it?
[08:31.18]Still doesn't want to lay out on the map enough.
[08:32.96]That's why in Grand Theft Auto 4 and 5, even if I played the game for 200 hours, it doesn't matter.
[08:40.49]I still need the GPS.
[08:42.69]Blame technology for that one, guys.
[08:46.17]Claim like the invention... I was gonna say the INVENTATION.
[08:52.74]Like it's a different noun when you're talking about something that was invented versus... The invention of satellite tracking and GPS systems.
[09:06.87]Inventation.
[09:07.79]That's like incantation.
[09:16.17]Alright, let's make the, uh, Defiler.
[09:19.75]Let's go.
[09:24.41]Just flame the incantations.
[09:25.88]It's always their fault.
[09:29.96]Did you mean innovation?
[09:31.50]Yes, innovation and invention combined.
[09:33.46]Inventation.
[09:38.36]Just give me a minute, I'll be okay.
[09:39.40]Alright, let's go safety, okay.
[09:46.32]Don't get up from your seats.
[09:47.07]Everything's gonna be fine.
[09:53.79]Save TK.
[10:00.75]He's lying down on a bed somewhere, right?
[10:05.80]Which bed is he in?
[10:06.50]The security room?
[10:08.40]Where even is this dude?
[10:17.19]Everybody's just crying.
[10:19.97]Yeah.
[10:21.41]You wouldn't be crying right now?
[10:25.21]Where is he?
[10:28.46]Downstairs?
[10:32.70]Which storage room?
[10:35.94]I know he's lying down on something.
[10:43.50]Alright, maybe everybody crying is a little odd, right?
[10:46.78]Maybe I would assume some people would be crying.
[10:49.80]But every single person is crying.
[10:51.63]You're right, it is a little odd.
[10:56.61]Alright, pick a door.
[10:59.17]Where is TK?
[11:01.53]Somebody help me.
[11:02.29]Upstairs, next to the cafe.
[11:03.65]Thank you!
[11:07.47]They're waiting for me to get close, and then they start crying.
[11:15.68]Alright, TK.
[11:17.34]Don't make me regret this.
[11:27.05]This was $150,000.
[11:27.33]You want that interview.
[11:28.25]It's plain and simple.
[11:28.99]Something in it for you too, baby.
[11:48.16]Now the move right there is to not flinch and to look right in the eyes and say, is that supposed to hurt?
[12:00.02]Wait, what?
[12:01.78]I thought I just hit him with a box because my head's too big.
[12:11.97]He spit on my mask, I'm fine.
[12:19.39]Alright.
[12:20.05]Cool.
[12:20.61]So... Thanks, little man.
[12:24.01]I was starting to feel real hungry.
[12:25.39]I knew you'd come through.
[12:27.31]You're welcome.
[12:29.61]Only reason I'm doing this is so you can do the time, scumbag.
[12:32.31]No easy way out for you.
[12:33.57]I... Whatever.
[12:35.80]Alright, this is it.
[12:36.98]The only lead.
[12:37.64]Let's go.
[12:42.30]What, uh... Ooh, hold on.
[12:44.82]Just one... Once.
[12:47.58]Man of my word...
[12:56.90]Alright, let's do the only lead.
[12:58.08]Now, where is this?
[12:58.96]Is this all the way in Atlantica Casino?
[13:03.54]Let's do it.
[13:03.82]Might as well just do some fun stuff.
[13:10.75]Yeah!
[13:11.75]Those of you guys that have played this game, is this a scenario where I'm going to have plenty of time, or can I just go dick around and level up and go find stuff?
[13:22.41]Is this one of those missions that takes 10 straight minutes to do?
[13:32.90]You never have time.
[13:34.20]I know.
[13:35.30]It's pretty quick.
[13:36.98]Alright.
[13:37.30]Well, I have a save point right at that checkpoint.
[13:41.61]I got a checkpoint here.
[13:42.39]Alright.
[13:42.69]Let's just look around.
[13:45.53]Something might pop up.
[13:47.19]You never know.
[13:52.03]We're going for a coffee creamer?
[13:55.56]Look, if this is the final Dead Rising 2 stream, I've got to milk it.
[14:01.65]That's one that's gonna run to the finish line.
[14:03.39]No, I gotta milk this.
[14:04.83]This is the last time you're gonna see this.
[14:06.59]Ever.
[14:07.33]I will never play this game ever again.
[14:09.65]You are never gonna see this game on stream in video format ever again.
[14:14.59]So, why not?
[14:15.93]Like, check this out.
[14:16.93]Pretty good swing.
[14:24.24]Okay, okay.
[14:31.74]Pretty good swing.
[14:34.70]Pretty good swing.
[14:35.72]What's this?
[14:36.54]Jello?
[14:37.72]Chili.
[14:41.06]If there's one thing I would never eat, it'd be one of those.
[14:44.60]I'm not gonna eat a cup of open chili, even in a zombie apocalypse.
[14:48.28]I'd rather eat one of these people.
[14:51.68]Was that gross?
[14:52.96]That was a little too gross, I think, wasn't it?
[14:57.06]I'm not sure if it's untrue, though.
[15:02.63]I don't think it might not be untrue.
[15:04.78]True!
[15:06.94]Sneakers?
[15:15.52]Stupid!
[15:17.60]Well, we got you.
[15:18.16]I need to be in my final outfit, though.
[15:21.51]I really like this.
[15:22.99]I really like this outfit.
[15:24.05]I don't think I want to get rid of it.
[15:29.09]I feel like this outfit's perfect.
[15:38.03]No shoes.
[15:38.95]I can't have no shoes.
[15:40.51]I already looked it up.
[15:43.17]I looked it up.
[15:43.89]I went to Fextralife... ...slash Dead Rising 2 off the record, and I went to all available shoes.
[15:50.70]It's not there.
[15:56.66]Wait, somebody said ro- Wait, this is our opportunity.
[15:58.74]Let's roll a seven.
[16:04.90]Three?
[16:07.78]Ooh, no.
[16:08.56]Almost.
[16:13.03]This is real, right?
[16:16.59]There's a... six?
[16:18.39]Give me one.
[16:19.96]Oh!
[16:21.50]That's real!
[16:22.48]That's actually a real thing!
[16:23.96]Are you serious?
[16:25.50]Nice work, person that said that four days ago.
[16:34.28]Should I go back to the casino?
[16:35.82]What do I do?
[16:36.82]Should I just play casino games for, like, four hours?
[16:44.51]Well, I'm gonna be in the casino anyways.
[16:45.99]Let's use this spell.
[16:53.00]Oh, by the way, if you're wondering what's gonna happen either later today or tomorrow, we're gonna be playing Katamari... I don't remember.
[17:01.90]It's Katamari's adjective.
[17:04.54]Or... Katamari forever.
[17:07.08]Katamari... Beautiful Katamari.
[17:08.52]The one from 360.
[17:09.42]I don't know the names.
[17:11.04]It's not like Katamari 1.
[17:12.52]Katamari 2.
[17:14.46]Beautiful Katamari.
[17:15.42]There it is.
[17:15.84]Alright.
[17:16.04]Let me go this way.
[17:20.91]Queen.
[17:21.83]Let's replace Queen with Queen.
[17:23.01]Nice.
[17:26.01]I'm almost level 31.
[17:26.69]Let's go upstairs.
[17:30.88]Forever is PS3.
[17:31.68]There you go.
[17:34.32]I also have the DLC for it.
[17:36.34]I heard it's a pretty short game.
[17:39.59]So I got DLC.
[17:40.73]There's a cap, though.
[17:46.85]No, I can't take this off.
[17:48.51]One Piece Pajama.
[17:52.77]It's this thing again.
[17:59.11]I had this on for way too long, though, didn't I?
[18:02.01]This is the thing I had on before.
[18:07.89]Goblin activate.
[18:12.63]You know, fuck it, let's go.
[18:13.85]Let's go.
[18:14.51]Final Dead Rising 2 stream.
[18:16.37]Whatever.
[18:16.71]I'm getting in the car.
[18:25.00]Let's go.
[18:27.84]Let's fucking go, bro.
[18:29.36]I didn't say, bro.
[18:31.50]What is it trying to do?
[18:36.14]Find the source to get in the underground tunnels.
[18:41.64]I can't bring my car.
[18:53.87]Have I been here?
[18:56.29]Machete and... Machete and Drill.
[19:06.39]Nope.
[19:07.93]Drill, Machete.
[19:09.47]Machete and... I know I can make this.
[19:12.39]Roman Machete.
[19:13.11]But is that even worth taking?
[19:14.21]I don't think this thing's very good.
[19:18.57]Is this thing very good?
[19:22.27]Flashlight and Gems.
[19:23.15]Yeah, I've made that already.
[19:25.53]I mean, it is pretty good.
[19:27.61]But then, I run out of space.
[19:29.29]Just drink the coffee, Kramer.
[19:30.43]Not like I'm gonna need it.
[19:31.25]Because I don't want to lose the katana.
[19:34.46]The katana's really good.
[19:37.16]How does this not, uh... Calc... How does this not calcify as a blade weapon?
[19:47.65]Big bits, huge... That's enormous bits.
[19:50.05]That is the biggest bits, like, ever.
[19:52.25]Hold on.
[19:56.18]That was... How much was that?
[19:57.68]12,000 bits from Freddy Dredd.
[20:04.54]There's not even a message here.
[20:05.98]It's just 12,000 bits from Freddy.
[20:11.68]Freddy, thanks for the more than $100.
[20:12.71]$120 converted currency dollars.
[20:22.36]Okay, there's people here.
[20:23.98]I didn't know... These guys are blue.
[20:26.14]Does that mean anything?
[20:30.92]Yeah, there's no message.
[20:31.96]It's just a huge drop of money.
[20:33.92]Thanks, Predator.
[20:37.18]It's the blue team.
[20:40.85]I think I got good weapons.
[20:41.91]I actually... No, I want to run these guys over, I think.
[20:44.69]When's my last save point?
[20:45.65]I don't know.
[20:45.99]I need a save point.
[20:48.37]Right here.
[20:48.61]This one right here.
[20:50.03]They blew it up.
[20:50.59]Uh-oh.
[20:59.95]I need a gun.
[21:01.53]If I'm gonna be dealing with guns now... Do the... make the wheelchair gun thing?
[21:15.36]Yeah, I really should do that.
[21:17.36]I'm just so indecisive.
[21:19.70]That's too slow.
[21:24.80]Alright, I think it's coming up here.
[21:28.41]Hardhat and beer is an Estus Flask.
[21:31.56]How am I supposed to get up there?
[21:32.74]How am I supposed to reliably kill these guys?
[21:42.80]I'm going for it.
[21:46.28]Stop coughing.
[21:50.03]Alright, alright, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[21:51.85]Stop it.
[21:52.27]Just get in here.
[21:52.73]I think there's a gun in here.
[21:55.73]No, I got a security uniform.
[21:59.23]Are they gonna come in here?
[22:00.01]Oh, I gotta get the big... Big guy's gonna come up with this.
[22:04.45]This is where I get my gun.
[22:08.13]I'm gonna just baseball swing them in the face.
[22:15.71]Come on in.
[22:16.59]I'm just gonna spin when he comes in the door.
[22:21.25]Killed him for me, so I don't have to do this.
[22:25.38]They'll come in.
[22:30.21]Shoot them!
[22:30.99]Thank you.
[22:32.83]Thank you.
[22:33.43]Nice.
[22:33.73]Alright, now make your way in here.
[22:36.15]How did that miss?
[22:39.98]They just have the door covered.
[22:42.20]How am I supposed to... Are they gonna come in?
[22:51.14]There's a shotgun.
[22:51.98]Wait, is there a shotgun?
[22:53.66]Oh, that!
[22:57.13]You mean that thing.
[22:58.83]Right, okay.
[23:19.01]That's what we like to call a double kill.
[23:29.48]Okay, I gotta go.
[23:31.36]Assault rifle, and I'm gonna replace... Let's... Another assault rifle.
[23:34.72]It's gonna be machine gun, people.
[23:37.52]It's not worth it.
[23:38.20]You know it.
[23:39.04]I know it.
[23:39.84]I'm not gonna pretend like it's worth having that.
[23:44.96]Wait, coffee creamer.
[23:46.63]No, it's just coffee.
[23:47.29]It's not worth taking it.
[23:49.11]Make gun wheelchair.
[23:53.00]Alright, hold on.
[23:57.20]Wheelchair, wheelchair, wheelchair, wheelchair.
[23:59.04]I'm getting it, I'm getting it, I'm getting it, I'm getting it!
[24:03.76]Oh no!
[24:04.38]Is it just one gun and wheelchair?
[24:09.82]Hurry!
[24:11.20]Hurry up and do it.
[24:14.98]It's not gun and wheelchair, what are you talking about?
[24:18.51]Wheelchair plus battery plus gun.
[24:25.00]Wait, it needs to be electric?
[24:27.64]This is a double combination?
[24:29.02]Oh, fuck it is.
[24:32.54]Are you serious?
[24:51.13]Let me see.
[24:52.69]Holy shit.
[24:53.79]Okay.
[24:56.45]Can I get in it?
[24:59.75]Alright, why doesn't Professor X just have this on his wheelchair?
[25:05.26]Wouldn't this help a little?
[25:10.64]Die.
[25:22.20]Like, there's no reason to not have that attached, right?
[25:30.72]What's the downside of having this as Professor X?
[25:41.80]They're behind... How am I supposed to get behind this sandbag?
[25:51.44]This is the stupidest thing.
[25:53.26]It's not even hitting them.
[25:57.83]Yeah, that was pretty cool.
[25:59.07]How many bolts does it have?
[26:12.82]Alright, I don't want to waste it.
[26:15.52]I would like it if it went faster.
[26:23.91]200% screen shake.
[26:26.07]Yeah, it actually kind of sucked.
[26:29.71]Alright, I'm going to wrap around this way.
[26:35.32]That's a rocket launcher potential, but I can't get out.
[26:43.15]No, it's not even... What am I supposed to... Bastard.
[27:09.22]Give me the other one.
[27:13.79]Alright, um, that wheelchair thing is not very good.
[27:19.51]Find the source of the gas?
[27:28.54]Found it.
[27:33.86]It has infinite ammo.
[27:39.88]So just hold the button and hit the screen shake as a downside.
[27:52.67]Alright, this is it.
[27:56.03]Wheelchair gone.
[28:03.01]I sort of blend in.
[28:06.93]I'm just the cartoon caricature version that you get at the theme park of the zombies.
[28:15.48]Quite a setup.
[28:26.36]The only thing that's missing is I need to be on a small bicycle, riding a surfboard, or holding a huge lollipop.
[28:38.53]I'm pretty sure all those things are in this game, too.
[28:41.09]So, that works.
[29:00.50]Not like this.
[29:05.53]Why do emotes... Emotes have just taken over our thoughts.
[29:11.21]Okay, let's get this bunch done.
[29:13.47]We're almost at capacity and we gotta get these damn bees ready for shipping out.
[29:21.24]Let's get this straggler.
[29:27.25]Seriously, when I think of something that's unnerving or kind of scary, I just see that Pepe face.
[29:31.91]The MonkaS.
[29:32.66]I just see it.
[29:33.36]I just... Oh, fuck.
[29:39.44]I don't even make that face.
[29:40.70]I just think about somebody in chat writing that face.
[29:49.81]I didn't save the game.
[29:58.15]Like, anytime I'm in a scary scenario, if it's terrifying, I'm just like, oh, somebody in chat just wrote MonkaS.
[30:04.52]Like, I'm not scared.
[30:05.50]I'm just, somebody else is scared for me.
[30:07.62]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[30:11.74]Should I not have shot those?
[30:14.68]Is it, was that a bad idea?
[30:16.10]Did I, am I causing a problem?
[30:26.31]Uh-oh.
[30:32.57]Wait, hard hat and beer, right?
[30:34.91]I'll take it for later.
[30:38.29]But first I need... How am I gonna get over there?
[30:47.16]Onion rings, quick.
[30:50.80]Done right there, nice.
[30:52.48]Pick it up.
[30:53.56]Pick it up.
[31:01.33]Alright, move.
[31:04.76]Where's the gun?
[31:08.08]Put down the fucking keyboard.
[31:14.17]Put down the keyboard!
[31:15.27]Alright, you know how some games have, like, oh, if I pick this up, just automatically trash it?
[31:20.67]Can I add keyboards to that list?
[31:24.45]Can I just auto just trash keyboards?
[31:29.94]I probably needed that.
[31:32.88]Boxes.
[31:33.62]Let me just...
[31:36.73]This is like a laser.
[31:38.28]Blast frequency gun.
[31:40.06]I'll change that up for a keyboard.
[31:42.06]What does this do?
[31:46.00]Another blast frequency gun.
[31:47.20]Which one's better?
[31:47.72]There's a lot of food here.
[31:55.01]Fuck the hard hat.
[31:56.83]I need to... Should I WWF somebody?
[32:05.77]Okay, gun.
[32:09.83]Uh, eat this.
[32:10.37]Just eat something.
[32:13.73]I want full health.
[32:14.47]How many do I have to healing?
[32:15.53]Uh, it's alright.
[32:18.83]It's not terrible.
[32:21.87]Hit somebody with a steel chair.
[32:23.03]I don't have enough room for it.
[32:30.44]Hold on.
[32:30.84]What's over this way?
[32:32.30]No, don't want it.
[32:40.03]Make room.
[32:40.53]Yes, I changed...
[33:05.71]Could I use your phone?
[33:07.23]Who the hell are you?
[33:08.39]You're not supposed to be in here!
[33:11.09]No, it's Dave!
[33:11.83]It's Dave!
[33:12.91]I work here!
[33:13.61]I just thought it would be funny to come out on Halloween like this!
[33:17.82]Wait, kill them?
[33:23.72]Uh... Anybody?
[33:30.55]What does this gun do?
[33:33.63]It just makes them throw up?
[33:54.12]What a way to die.
[33:55.15]That was not fun.
[34:01.63]Ugh, desktop.
[34:02.60]Clean up that desktop.
[34:03.60]I hate that.
[34:03.98]That's an anxiety desktop.
[34:06.14]Move those icons.
[34:07.82]Put some folders there.
[34:08.86]You're freaking me out.
[34:24.76]Taking the coffee?
[34:32.54]Well, I don't think this guy makes it, Frank.
[34:44.75]Somebody just brews a pot like 12 hours ago and it just sits on the heater.
[34:50.23]Of course it sucks.
[34:55.54]That guy didn't make... There's no French press in here, Frank.
[35:02.21]Alright, here we go.
[35:05.35]The source of the gas is a paramilitary operation underneath the city.
[35:09.77]The others need to hear about this.
[35:13.43]Alright.
[35:14.97]So, what do we got?
[35:19.15]Take a full heal.
[35:21.05]I told you.
[35:24.64]I'll take a queen.
[35:25.36]I'll take a full heal.
[35:28.16]Give me the... I'll replace this.
[35:30.54]What is that?
[35:30.82]Like a VR?
[35:32.68]Military case.
[35:33.48]Defibrillator.
[35:38.36]Take a computer.
[35:41.06]Take a computer?
[35:45.88]Why am I taking a computer?
[35:48.04]Take a computer.
[35:48.82]A puke gun and the computer.
[35:56.98]Alright.
[35:58.28]I'll try it.
[35:59.30]I have to carry it, though.
[36:01.04]No, take it with the amp.
[36:04.45]Amp?
[36:07.61]Pute gun and amplifier.
[36:12.37]Where's there an amp?
[36:15.79]The guitar amp.
[36:16.75]Well, why am I taking this, then?
[36:21.78]He doesn't see it.
[36:24.70]There's no amp in here.
[36:27.71]Where do you see an amp?
[36:32.99]I gotta go.
[36:34.95]It's behind you.
[36:35.67]Stop reading chat.
[36:36.73]Yeah, good idea.
[36:37.99]That's a fantastic solution.
[36:48.80]I thought that was an amp right there.
[36:49.90]Ooh, urgent.
[36:52.90]Frank, Rebecca wants to know if you found anything out.
[36:55.66]Do you know where the gas
[36:58.83]Yep.
[37:00.08]Should I answer?
[37:00.80]Why am I not answering?
[37:04.40]Amp in here?
[37:05.62]Amp.
[37:07.56]Uh-oh!
[37:19.57]Is this what you guys want?
[37:22.61]Super BFG.
[37:24.01]Blast Frequency Gun and Amplifier.
[37:26.19]15 shots.
[37:29.07]Alright, I'm not going to use it.
[37:30.13]I'm going to hold on to it.
[37:33.48]Guitar and... Guitar and flashlight?
[37:41.48]Wait, flashlight and computer.
[37:44.31]That's just a... That's just a zoomer Jack-o'-lantern.
[37:47.91]No.
[37:50.47]I don't know.
[38:10.02]You can't even make a Jack-o'-lantern.
[38:11.76]How many times do I have to talk about the Jack-o'-lantern portion of that stream?
[38:16.84]I was covered in slime and had knives in my hands, and the whole ground was covered in slime.
[38:22.70]That's how you die.
[38:24.62]That's how you end up in the hospital.
[38:26.40]I canned that portion of that stream.
[38:28.66]Uh-uh.
[38:31.11]The whole ground was covered in a substance that if I take a quarter of a step to my right, I go and split backwards.
[38:38.70]And you want me to hold a knife while I do that?
[38:41.19]I don't understand, does he just not know how to carve with a pumpkin?
[38:55.72]Why won't he hold the knife in his hand?
[38:58.26]That's covered in slime!
[39:04.62]What is this looking at me?
[39:08.09]Oh, beer.
[39:18.33]Sorry guys, I don't have the hard hat.
[39:25.60]This thing's actually pretty good against zombies.
[39:29.40]You shouldn't have gotten slimed.
[39:31.69]Alright.
[39:32.85]Whatever you say.
[39:38.27]Am I carrying a magazine?
[39:39.37]Yeah, it's for sharp weapons.
[39:47.22]15 shots in this thing.
[39:48.24]Do I even still have it?
[39:49.14]Yeah.
[39:51.52]I have to save the fucking game, guys.
[39:53.58]Alright, hard hat.
[39:55.88]Which I replace.
[39:56.53]This thing's pretty much broken.
[40:06.81]What about the gun?
[40:08.29]Oh, but I need it.
[40:13.66]I need this gun.
[40:14.30]In case... Get rid of the edged weapons.
[40:20.18]The magazine.
[40:20.84]The queen.
[40:22.18]Let me at least get a use out of this, then.
[40:24.00]The wrench.
[40:24.60]No, let me get the... I'm gonna use this.
[40:27.49]I still have the katana.
[40:28.43]Yeah, the katana's a good weapon.
[40:32.71]Sword is broken against the bosses.
[40:34.11]That's true.
[40:36.23]You're wasting time.
[40:36.99]Fuck.
[40:37.19]Fuck.
[40:39.85]They're right!
[40:40.21]No, they're right!
[40:40.63]They're right!
[40:41.11]No, they're right!
[40:41.71]They're right!
[40:41.99]No, they're right!
[40:42.51]No, they're right!
[40:42.99]No, they're right!
[40:43.65]They're right!
[40:43.97]No, no, no, no, no!
[40:44.49]They're right!
[40:44.89]They're right!
[40:47.51]I'll take the PP.
[40:48.09]Uh, okay.
[41:01.92]I just... Almost 31.
[41:05.02]Alright, just give me a hard hat.
[41:09.10]I can't get rid of the gun.
[41:10.00]It's so good at range.
[41:12.32]It's just... It's so good.
[41:14.18]Is it money?
[41:17.58]Suitcase.
[41:18.02]Wait, can I... Nothing in these?
[41:24.54]Guess not.
[41:25.12]Okay.
[41:25.90]Wait.
[41:26.84]Don't I have keys?
[41:30.64]Is this the safety deposit box room?
[41:37.38]What if I have another keys?
[41:52.91]Money case.
[41:54.85]Does money even matter anymore, though?
[41:56.76]Let's be honest.
[41:58.62]That's $150,000.
[41:59.26]That's pretty good.
[42:06.28]Military vehicle.
[42:08.40]Alright.
[42:08.68]Ooh, you got a gun.
[42:15.27]Oh, shit.
[42:22.10]Get away from me!
[42:25.04]Okay, good.
[42:25.56]Assault rifle.
[42:26.12]That's what I wanted.
[42:26.86]That's what I wanted.
[42:27.40]There's a queen there, but I don't care.
[42:30.48]Use the super BFG.
[42:31.62]Not necessary.
[42:34.60]Alright, where am I going?
[42:37.22]Oh, I gotta go back.
[42:39.06]Like, hurry up.
[42:40.36]Through the trail.
[42:44.15]Try it out?
[42:45.05]No.
[42:51.29]There's a safe point right here.
[42:57.51]I'm not soft-locked.
[42:59.01]I've got time.
[43:00.07]Look, I've got time.
[43:01.09]8-2.
[43:02.01]We're going to do the middle one.
[43:08.84]I've got time.
[43:09.22]Don't worry.
[43:09.74]I actually do.
[43:33.46]Get away from me!
[43:35.91]Alright, I'll use it once!
[43:37.21]Oh my god, that's ridiculous.
[43:41.93]Okay, alright, I gotta go.
[43:46.82]All this because I saved it.
[43:48.64]I should've just ran.
[43:55.20]I fucking pushed my shit down the... Kill me.
[44:00.03]Just kill me.
[44:00.91]I'm gonna restart right there.
[44:04.89]I got screwed over because I saved the game and I turned around and there's ten people behind me.
[44:21.96]There's no reason to take, like, seven cheese slices of damage.
[44:24.70]There's no reason to do that.
[44:26.14]I have, like, full health.
[44:29.85]Like, why would I do that?
[44:31.13]I don't even care about the katana.
[44:33.07]The thing's broken anyway.
[44:53.86]Are you seriously gonna interrupt my attack with that, with a sneeze?
[45:02.85]Use the BFG?
[45:03.31]I'm gonna use the BFG for the last helicopter that's in the game.
[45:07.49]I'm gonna shoot the helicopter like five times and I win.
[45:09.63]Don't, don't, don't stop the stun!
[45:32.24]Okay, it's actually kind of fun.
[45:33.42]Alright, no, I'll take it down to 10.
[45:43.67]I should really take that coffee, but I kind of don't want to stop.
[45:53.70]There's orange juice right here.
[46:01.61]Ooh, that's nice.
[46:05.20]Let's move.
[46:08.04]Almost there.
[46:10.86]It's a crutch weapon, crutch weapon, crutch weapon.
[46:13.10]Boomerang.
[46:19.60]You're really good at throwing the boomerang, friend.
[46:22.46]Okay.
[46:23.66]Third time's the charm.
[46:25.10]Third time's the charm.
[46:26.05]Let's go.
[46:29.76]Why are you side-arming it?
[46:40.72]B. F. G. L. U. L. Where's the Shaun of the Dead shirt?
[46:55.57]No, this is not a licensed stream.
[46:58.96]This is an unlicensed stream.
[47:09.40]Okay.
[47:10.37]Save it again.
[47:10.89]This is the final thing.
[47:14.17]8-3.
[47:14.67]And then we got the last mission coming up.
[47:19.47]You're wearing a Street Fighter mask.
[47:22.38]Um... When did I ever say the word street and then fighter next to each other?
[47:27.78]No, this is... Big green man face.
[47:31.86]Where are you getting that idea from?
[47:35.27]Okay, I'm... Is there alcohol?
[47:51.98]Get the beer hat?
[47:52.72]I know.
[47:53.02]There's gonna be alcoholic right here.
[47:59.12]Phenotrans.
[48:00.52]They orchestrated this whole thing.
[48:03.71]Phenotrans?
[48:05.31]But they make Zombrex.
[48:07.91]You two just calm down a minute here.
[48:10.69]It's the Zombrex company.
[48:11.39]They wanted to infect everybody so then they could sell everybody Zombrex.
[48:14.89]It's a conspiracy.
[48:31.84]Yeah, but if the world is all zombies, then what the hell... What are you gonna do with money then?
[49:02.16]Burn it?
[49:02.56]Oh, they're lining up for Zombrex.
[49:06.88]They're paying with, like, cash.
[49:07.91]What the fuck was that?
[49:09.87]Did I do that?
[49:30.41]Oh no, she grabbed my gun.
[49:37.27]The backstab.
[49:38.69]No!
[50:08.85]What, fake hair?
[50:09.87]Wait, did I just pull her whole scalp off?
[50:13.60]Is it wig?
[50:14.20]I'm gonna get you some help.
[50:16.64]It's too late for me.
[50:18.46]You, you gotta take care of this for all of us.
[50:23.72]Thanks for saving my ass.
[50:26.04]Wig.
[50:27.08]Oh, obliterate.
[50:33.16]Looks like there's a party going on in Fortune Park.
[50:40.77]Okay.
[50:41.33]Well, that was a little... Stacy is with the Fentatrans.
[50:45.42]She's harvesting all the zombies and trying to kill me.
[50:49.78]Does this go right... right...
[51:04.93]The cutscene is way less emotional when you're wearing the mask.
[51:07.91]Alright, the facts.
[51:09.85]So, I gotta wear the beer helmet.
[51:11.37]That's important.
[51:13.05]Any whiskey in here?
[51:14.69]Wait.
[51:17.68]You could have been a great... You could have been a great kid.
[51:22.20]We could have been great.
[51:24.52]I'm reading that wrong.
[51:27.66]You didn't deserve this, Sullivan.
[51:29.96]I can't believe I didn't see through that bitch's lies.
[51:41.44]Sicko, psycho, sicko.
[51:42.58]This is for the police, guys.
[51:43.84]Come on.
[52:04.87]So, that's the final boss?
[52:08.27]Where's TK?
[52:12.22]Well, it's alright.
[52:13.14]I got the fucking BFG.
[52:16.94]Is there whiskey in here?
[52:21.35]No, it's snacks.
[52:23.47]No whiskey?
[52:25.31]Alright, whiskey's everywhere.
[52:26.49]So I have to make that before a thousand people unsub this channel.
[52:32.28]So bear with me here for a minute, guys.
[52:43.33]It's beer.
[52:43.84]Okay.
[52:44.18]Right.
[52:54.80]TK. TK. TK. TK. TK. TK. TK. TK.
[53:00.71]Okay.
[53:06.19]Everybody saying TK.
[53:11.32]Alright.
[53:12.92]Let's go see what's going on.
[53:19.23]TK, how are you?
[53:25.57]It's the same conversation I had before.
[53:37.34]How long are some of your guys' noses at this point?
[53:42.49]You guys tell anymore fucking lies, your nose is going through the monitor.
[53:50.35]I'm surprised you can even make it, like, through a doorway.
[53:53.27]Well, no, that's just a straight-on, so you'd be fine.
[53:55.69]Don't turn, though.
[53:56.31]You'll break in half.
[54:00.89]Uh, Jill Kronk is thanks for the five community subs.
[54:03.57]No beer?
[54:04.59]Alright, the facts.
[54:11.10]I'm just looking for the facts.
[54:16.23]One beer is all I need.
[54:17.33]I'm going to go to the bar.
[54:19.99]There's usually a bar.
[54:20.91]Where's their bar?
[54:22.25]The closest bar.
[54:28.47]The drink bean.
[54:29.89]I mean, this is the drink bean, but they don't have beer here, do they?
[54:35.32]You don't serve beer at a coffee shop.
[54:43.44]No.
[54:48.48]Vegas does.
[54:50.28]Yeah, but that's different.
[54:51.00]Alright.
[54:52.54]Uh, where's there just a bar?
[54:53.80]I know there's one, like, all the way down.
[54:56.14]Sports.
[54:56.68]What's in the middle here?
[54:59.22]Something in the middle.
[55:00.12]Is that the craps thing?
[55:07.15]Yeah, there might even be one over here.
[55:15.21]I'll take another orange juice, yes I will.
[55:24.39]I love Minestrone Soup.
[55:26.85]It's pretty good, yeah.
[55:28.65]It's very good.
[55:30.87]I'm with you on that one.
[55:35.73]Alright.
[55:36.19]Beer.
[55:37.69]Just coffee free.
[55:39.49]Oh my goodness.
[55:41.18]Can I puke with the mask on?
[55:45.56]Oh, they have anti-puke shields.
[55:49.90]Wait, he has one.
[55:50.78]Why is it working on me?
[56:03.65]It's because I'm infected.
[56:06.95]Oh.
[56:08.05]That's what it is, huh?
[56:11.05]Weird.
[56:12.51]Alright.
[56:14.57]I need a beer.
[56:16.89]Beer.
[56:21.77]No beers in there?
[56:22.57]How's that possible?
[56:23.63]It's a craps table.
[56:31.50]Perfect opportunity.
[56:33.02]Check it out.
[56:37.16]Nice.
[56:38.10]Alright, no more.
[56:42.03]Looking for a beer.
[56:42.63]I see one.
[57:08.15]Is that a beer or is that ketchup?
[57:18.66]Damn it, it's ketchup.
[57:23.88]What about the security box stuff?
[57:27.02]I feel like I missed a whole portion of this game.
[57:36.87]In the Uranus Zone.
[57:41.48]What's it called?
[57:42.80]Jump scare?
[57:43.71]Jump space.
[57:50.01]Fortune City Bank.
[57:53.14]Alright, let's go.
[58:12.40]I don't think this is a car.
[58:13.56]I really don't.
[58:14.20]It does not operate like a car.
[58:24.78]This thing floats.
[58:26.00]It's on air.
[58:27.24]That thing controls like an air hockey puck.
[58:30.72]What's going on?
[59:08.35]Photo time.
[59:18.57]Ah, the tree got in the way.
[59:20.97]No, it's not.
[59:21.72]It's a very bad photo, actually.
[59:25.44]But I think I still- I think I got it.
[59:27.36]Alright, where am I going?
[59:34.73]This way.
[59:35.57]Save point.
[59:37.87]I don't want to get too overzealous because I don't want to activate the final game.
[59:40.89]Frank needs Zombrex.
[59:43.45]Oh, shit.
[59:43.85]I forgot I could take that.
[59:48.29]Watch out.
[59:49.29]It's a pod.
[59:52.29]Do I kill this?
[59:58.70]God damn it.
[60:04.84]I got a picture of the pod.
[60:06.72]Uh oh, I'm gonna get hurt.
[60:14.43]No!
[60:30.61]That's not what I want!
[60:31.67]Alright, let's destroy this thing.
[60:40.13]Destroy it!
[60:42.87]Nice.
[60:43.79]What did that do?
[60:50.98]Why am I playing with a controller?
[60:52.18]Because I prefer controllers.
[60:57.26]For third-person action games, I play GTA with a controller.
[61:00.36]I play them with a controller.
[61:09.06]I know it has terrible analog gaming, but moving around and walking around is a lot better than WASD.
[61:15.43]It can be in third-person games.
[61:17.63]I just like it.
[61:19.05]I like the analog.
[61:19.75]Because WASD, for its subtle turns, like what you just saw right there.
[61:24.47]Subtle.
[61:28.85]Mouse is only good for first-person?
[61:30.26]Well, it depends.
[61:33.38]It depends.
[61:36.04]Oh my god, I didn't see it coming in.
[61:46.60]Oh, fuck, this is very bad.
[61:49.24]Where is he?
[61:52.96]Okay, so they're just everywhere.
[62:02.41]They're everywhere, and they are wearing, like, all grey, so they blend in with the background of the game.
[62:40.02]Alright, you know what?
[62:41.28]There's not enough people to do this.
[63:01.96]Is there a reason for me to do this?
[63:03.12]Does anybody know?
[63:04.48]Or is this a way to... Is this gonna be TP?
[63:10.24]That's clean.
[63:15.98]I definitely don't want to get rid of that.
[63:17.72]Here, just... Let me back my machine gun.
[63:27.96]Let me back my rifle.
[63:30.26]Let's go.
[63:34.40]Wait.
[63:35.86]Okay.
[63:36.84]Easy, easy, easy.
[63:39.02]Alright, watch out for the military.
[63:42.85]They're like right over here.
[63:44.41]Just hug the wall.
[63:49.01]BFG.
[63:51.53]Didn't even matter.
[63:55.14]All it takes is one guy to just be standing near you.
[64:06.83]Alright, here we go.
[64:17.41]That's it, right?
[64:21.85]Yep.
[64:24.25]Boom.
[64:31.10]Alright.
[64:33.16]Any assault rifles?
[64:37.71]Have I screamed yet?
[64:38.53]Not yet.
[64:44.35]Blueberry buffet.
[64:45.99]Let's go!
[65:06.02]Dermot, please scream.
[65:08.23]Why do you guys want me to scream?
[65:10.93]Alright.
[65:12.47]Save points right ahead.
[65:13.19]I'm gonna do that.
[65:23.74]I'm gonna take... Do I have room?
[65:26.12]There's a lot of food here.
[65:29.04]They can't get over here, so... They can't get over here, right?
[65:37.13]I still need a beer.
[65:38.15]Did anybody see a beer?
[65:39.45]No, there's a large soda.
[65:41.40]No beer.
[66:04.81]When you don't want one, it is never around.
[66:06.87]But when you do want one, you can never find it.
[66:10.92]Money?
[66:15.68]Go to the bar?
[66:16.50]Well, let me go to the bank first.
[66:27.52]All these security keys that I don't even know what the hell they're for.
[66:30.43]And it's the final... Like, the final portion of this whole game.
[66:34.87]Save it for me.
[66:47.08]Shit.
[66:48.52]I remember this fight.
[66:52.68]Wow, look at all these memories we've made in Dead Rising 2.
[66:55.66]Too many to count.
[67:05.22]We'll just do this one.
[67:14.64]Yeah, remember we came in here?
[67:15.58]There's a boss that ran around in circles and stuff.
[67:20.97]Beer in the trash.
[67:24.29]Does vodka count?
[67:28.49]No.
[67:35.49]Scrounging into the garbage cans with drinks.
[67:40.37]Two bottles of vodka, for real?
[67:41.99]I don't even want it.
[67:43.67]I want to just see it break.
[67:47.12]Go to the bar?
[67:48.08]Yeah, I know, but if it's like here, I'm gonna do it.
[67:50.60]Because I need a maintenance program anyways.
[68:10.08]Nothing.
[68:11.06]Where the hell am I?
[68:13.01]Oh, this is the bank.
[68:13.79]No, it's not.
[68:17.25]Food.
[68:18.97]Coming soon.
[68:20.31]Music.
[68:22.35]Bagged.
[68:24.23]Sports.
[68:27.01]Venice Touch.
[68:28.13]Where's the action?
[68:28.79]Is the bar right in the middle here?
[68:32.64]Jump space.
[68:33.92]Right here.
[68:37.08]I'll get it after this.
[68:45.96]the bank.
[68:55.12]Alright, so I'm in the bank.
[68:56.40]Uh... Security clearance accepted.
[69:05.26]Look at all these boxes.
[69:06.62]Security box 1.
[69:07.70]How much money was in there? $50,000?! !
[69:15.28]Hold on.
[69:15.84]All this money?
[69:16.62]329.
[69:16.64]No.
[69:18.52]Why didn't I just come here?
[69:27.18]Locked.
[69:27.46]$100,000 in there. 040.
[69:38.68]God.
[69:41.32]185.
[69:41.68]10 grand.
[69:42.18]999.
[69:43.12]There's Zombrex in here.
[69:51.87]That's unbelievable.
[69:55.86]Okay, let's just... Might as well open them all.
[69:57.72]I'm here.
[69:58.08]There's Zombrex in here, too.
[70:02.44]Okay.
[70:06.37]Gems?
[70:07.87]I don't need, I don't want these.
[70:08.69]I have four Zombrexes.
[70:12.07]Should I just take two?
[70:15.75]What happens if I stick myself a Zombrex twice?
[70:22.79]Just gems.
[70:24.33]That's shitty.
[70:32.52]Well, that's an extra almost 500 grand from the security boxes.
[70:41.86]You become immune.
[70:45.48]Well... Buy the car again.
[70:47.90]That's not going to do anything for me, though.
[70:52.06]Let's keep going.
[70:53.04]Well, that was cool.
[70:54.72]Now let's go to the bar.
[71:01.33]And then I'm going to go to the maintenance room.
[71:04.47]And then I can get... I think another... People will resubscribe to me.
[71:17.36]Imagine not buying the Hummer and buying the sports car instead.
[71:20.76]Oh mega lull.
[71:22.80]Whatever.
[71:30.79]I don't even know what that means.
[71:34.79]Alright, there's a beer.
[71:35.95]You ready?
[71:38.79]I'm gonna do it.
[71:43.74]Where's that maintenance from?
[71:44.58]It's like right here somewhere.
[71:53.19]right there don't accidentally drink it that kind of looks like fun you can play these too maybe I should play these
[72:24.65]Alright, the time you've been waiting for.
[72:27.31]Wait, closed door, closed door, closed door.
[72:28.93]I know, I know, I gotta... What a ricochet.
[72:35.11]What a ricochet.
[72:40.74]And beer.
[72:47.56]Here you go.
[72:56.65]Beer hat.
[72:58.57]So.
[73:00.97]Okay, cool.
[73:01.75]So who cares?
[73:02.51]It's kind of cool.
[73:10.56]Alright.
[73:14.32]Save the game.
[73:17.94]Straight ahead.
[73:18.66]I got my beer hat.
[73:19.54]I got everything I need.
[73:20.86]This way.
[73:23.49]Best healing in the game?
[73:24.53]Who cares?
[73:25.03]Is it the best healing in the game?
[73:28.83]How often can I use it?
[73:39.24]Going the wrong way.
[73:43.45]Don't ever use it.
[73:45.13]Oh, should I have to finish this?
[73:46.55]I only get five hours until the whole game explodes?
[73:51.20]How do I get over here?
[74:02.42]Can I not get in there?
[74:17.07]I can't get into that save point from here?
[74:19.69]There's a tunnel.
[74:21.27]Oh, okay, that way.
[74:30.08]Anything else over here?
[74:30.72]Orange juice.
[74:33.06]I'll take the orange juice.
[74:35.34]Just in case I need it.
[74:38.26]Jeremy Softlock Elbertson.
[74:46.69]I have not gotten softlocked once, and you know it.
[74:50.33]A softlock would mean that I have to start the game over.
[74:54.47]I haven't had to start the game over yet.
[75:03.16]I'm fine.
[75:03.66]Alright, the facts.
[75:07.68]Let's move.
[75:17.06]This thing's really good for just clearing a path.
[75:27.16]So, just bang a left.
[75:33.81]Something you never do.
[75:35.23]I've only been able to do this with this weapon for the last, like, 20 minutes.
[75:41.32]And stopping and clearing a path is actually kind of hard, because you have to... If you have people with you, they just don't listen.
[75:47.63]You wanna go through the window?
[75:52.23]What do you want me to do here, game?
[76:08.51]Hold on to this.
[76:12.51]Alright, this is it.
[76:19.26]Harvester.
[76:19.78]There's another harvester here.
[76:21.16]Uh-oh.
[76:22.94]Military!
[76:33.09]Goblin mask and battery?
[76:42.58]It's not the best time to tell me all this.
[76:52.76]It's wasted.
[76:54.54]Alright, let's destroy this thing.
[77:05.21]Get that gun.
[77:22.75]Okay.
[77:25.39]Still good.
[77:28.59]Another one of those carcass dudes.
[77:30.52]I'm gonna have to use the BFG here.
[77:32.48]Uh-oh.
[77:33.26]Yeah.
[77:33.72]Okay.
[77:34.10]Alright.
[77:34.32]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[77:36.84]Just...
[77:54.80]He's not a threat, he has a throw-up gun.
[78:02.47]Give me that.
[78:11.95]Uh... See the gun on you?
[78:19.19]It's not very much ammo.
[78:21.93]Oh, boop.
[78:31.98]Wormaloo, thanks for the 10 gifted subs.
[78:33.88]Thank you, Wormaloo.
[78:35.28]Sorry, I couldn't really look.
[78:36.30]Alright, we're gonna try the hat.
[78:42.90]Should I drink out of the hat?
[78:46.14]No, I still have an arch, too.
[78:48.70]I'm free of the slot.
[78:49.46]Okay.
[79:03.29]Flashlight.
[79:04.25]Box and nails.
[79:09.51]Box and nails and propane tank?
[79:14.17]Alright.
[79:19.81]It's a hazard.
[79:21.28]I have to... Alright, I gotta use it.
[79:23.86]Going this way.
[79:25.86]Wait, there's gems right there.
[79:30.38]There's gems right here.
[79:31.22]Hold on.
[79:34.82]Leave me alone.
[79:50.08]Stop coughing.
[79:52.24]You coughed so long.
[80:05.27]Lightsaber.
[80:19.82]I can't do anything with that.
[80:20.88]Laser sword and blast gun?
[80:26.95]I know I'm probably getting one guy right now.
[80:28.57]It's alright.
[80:28.95]Let's move.
[80:29.41]I gotta move.
[80:29.89]Facts, facts, facts, facts.
[80:36.39]I don't have any guns for this.
[80:40.07]Shit.
[80:40.95]Um... I'm just gonna avoid them.
[80:47.36]I have to go that way.
[80:51.68]Alright, see if I can do anything above this.
[81:08.23]Whoa!
[81:13.45]Holy shit, you just came out of nowhere.
[81:15.05]Alright, that's actually the best thing that could've happened.
[81:25.22]Fucking aiming.
[81:27.50]Guy with a gun.
[81:43.96]Alright, we're good.
[81:45.70]Give me your gun.
[81:47.80]Why do you have a- why were you holding a serving tray?
[81:50.76]Still have a gun, right?
[82:06.51]Give me that.
[82:23.51]How many more of these are there?
[82:27.05]I tried to aim at you.
[82:38.45]Okay.
[82:43.78]I got it when I need it.
[82:44.56]I'm gonna need it right over here.
[82:45.42]Here we go.
[82:46.14]I'm gonna line it up.
[82:54.84]Are they dead?
[82:56.42]Where's the military?
[83:08.01]Just more of these things?
[83:15.63]I picked up an ice cream!
[83:18.14]Shit.
[83:18.58]Okay, I gotta... I want that gun back.
[83:38.54]Alright, my crutch is almost gone.
[83:39.80]Is this thing gone?
[83:46.00]It is.
[83:49.38]Go!
[83:53.66]I got one more shot in this thing.
[83:55.00]Make it work.
[84:06.91]Did I pass one?
[84:07.85]Where did that helmet go?
[84:15.47]All the way down here.
[84:16.49]Is there a car I can get?
[84:25.58]Is there a drink out of the helmet?
[84:31.58]It's probably out.
[84:32.14]No, I have to move.
[84:42.48]Okay, I think he's actually pretty good.
[84:49.47]Wait, picture!
[84:52.09]That's not a secret picture or something?
[84:55.69]How?
[84:57.83]Is there a save point?
[84:58.83]This one's straight ahead.
[85:21.59]Alright, save point.
[85:22.47]Right in the middle.
[85:24.95]Hopefully I have enough time to do this.
[85:27.85]Come on, where are we?
[85:30.31]Day 5.
[85:49.98]I would say this is the safe one.
[85:51.52]We'll do this one.
[85:57.60]I don't know what I have for items right now.
[86:04.92]I have the beer hat.
[86:11.77]That's it.
[86:27.61]Wasted.
[86:28.47]Wasted.
[86:28.81]It's alright.
[86:29.73]I'm just- I have to get through.
[86:33.57]There's some guns up here, definitely.
[86:35.33]Yeah, gonna get sawed by this.
[86:46.80]Fuckers.
[86:47.58]Give me the queen!
[86:53.00]It's a grenade!
[86:57.86]What happened?
[86:59.60]Was that a super queen?
[87:02.03]Was that like an ultra queen?
[87:03.61]Did I throw the grenade?
[87:08.49]How?
[87:16.38]Get away from me.
[87:17.16]There's so many.
[87:23.28]I need that gun back, but it's okay.
[87:25.58]Oh, fuck.
[87:45.55]No!
[87:46.91]No!
[87:47.27]I need this.
[87:49.79]Give me that queen!
[87:52.11]Okay, um... Where's my helmet?
[88:18.84]45.
[88:18.86]Okay.
[88:20.44]There's still more to do here.
[88:23.08]How the fuck is this possible?
[88:35.94]There's more of this shit?
[88:39.42]Oh, man.
[88:40.20]I need to get that food over there.
[88:48.65]I got the assault rifle.
[88:49.77]What do you mean?
[88:51.97]A dope?
[88:55.76]What are you, a dope?
[89:01.08]Uh-oh.
[89:01.22]Oh, shit.
[89:02.20]I'm in trouble.
[89:03.12]I'm in trouble.
[89:03.72]I didn't even bring out the thing.
[89:16.27]Oh no!
[89:17.99]Give me the queen, quick!
[89:19.55]She's right here!
[89:21.67]Good!
[89:22.81]Defiler!
[89:23.39]Give me this other queen!
[89:28.73]How many are there?
[89:30.75]Oh!
[89:32.21]Okay.
[89:43.20]This feels like I'm cheating, but who cares?
[89:45.89]I don't even know what I have for items.
[89:50.55]Oh, fuck.
[89:51.19]Okay.
[90:12.16]Don't puke, don't puke.
[90:17.04]Another fucking Harvester.
[90:32.51]Holy shit, that took a million years.
[90:42.99]I'm so glad I did not dick around any longer than that.
[90:45.39]Oh.
[90:52.64]Well, here's your update.
[90:54.10]It's going just fine, Stacy.
[90:55.92]I just destroyed your last harvester.
[90:58.69]And now, I'm coming for you.
[91:03.68]Come and get me, you interfering bastard.
[91:06.50]I'll be in the theme park.
[91:07.85]You can come play on my ride.
[91:09.91]You interfering bastard.
[91:12.69]Save the game right here.
[91:41.16]And then I'm gonna go wheelchair, so let's go.
[91:47.77]You know what?
[91:49.59]Get this fucking thing out of the way!
[91:51.95]Get it out of the way!
[91:53.11]I wanna save!
[92:03.57]Day 5, 4 AM.
[92:05.51]Day 5, 12.
[92:06.35]Alright, I'm going to save over this one.
[92:10.84]No, that... I don't know.
[92:12.18]This one.
[92:12.40]This one.
[92:12.76]Okay.
[92:34.11]Really?
[92:35.33]Sloppy-ass fucking thing.
[92:37.29]Give me a break.
[92:38.87]That's just so unbelievable.
[92:40.59]Just drive it.
[92:48.15]That's what I wanted to do.
[92:49.07]I want to pick up and push.
[92:52.91]Jesus, come on.
[92:55.92]PUSH!
[92:56.62]THE WHEELCHAIR!
[92:57.88]WHAT ARE YOU STOPPING YOU?!
[92:59.20]I'M SO ANGRY!
[93:01.58]SERIOUSLY?!
[93:02.60]Well, I just took like three fucking pieces of damage for no reason.
[93:14.30]Place it down.
[93:16.07]Stand behind it.
[93:17.97]Circle.
[93:18.73]Are you in the right- I think you're in the right area.
[93:21.91]Yeah.
[93:22.39]Okay, now you can push it.
[93:40.48]What ride is she on?
[93:41.20]I don't know.
[93:45.70]I'm almost out of stuff to eat and stuff to drink and stuff to consume.
[93:50.14]Is she on this ride?
[93:54.04]Come on!
[93:59.00]Alright, just eat here for a second.
[94:08.41]There's always beer in the beer hat?
[94:09.87]Yeah, I know, but I don't want to, like, be throwing up.
[94:15.02]Yes, I was about to eat the spoiled hot dog, and then I immediately came to the conclusion it was a bad idea to spoil it.
[94:30.03]Right here?
[94:36.29]Is she gonna get into Metal Gear?
[94:57.40]You and Cure are killing all those people?
[95:00.83]Your heart is a human being, but I'm destroying lives.
[95:05.07]Good.
[95:05.89]Good one.
[95:07.01]After everything that's happened, you still haven't figured it out, have you, Frank?
[95:13.64]What kind of reporter are you?
[95:17.16]I'm a phenotransplant.
[95:19.52]And Cure's been a very convenient little tool for us.
[95:23.60]They keep starting outbreaks.
[95:25.56]Haven't you noticed?
[95:27.84]Eager little activists.
[95:31.42]You work for phenotrans.
[95:35.26]So this is all for what?
[95:38.10]For money?
[95:40.02]You're even more of an idiot than I thought, Frank.
[95:43.51]This is about saving lives.
[95:46.23]Saving lives?
[95:48.97]You created a panic to drive up demand.
[95:54.21]This is funny.
[95:55.13]We can't make your precious Zombrex without Queens.
[95:59.60]A necessary sacrifice for our country.
[96:03.08]And, uh, TK looting the city.
[96:06.61]I suppose that was for our country.
[96:09.90]Oh, please.
[96:11.25]He was well paid for giving us access to the cages.
[96:15.09]His show was going down the tubes anyway, which was obvious since you were on it.
[96:20.91]Then he decided to get Kuro- Oh, look at me!
[96:23.31]Look at me!
[96:25.15]Make it hard for us to finish the job.
[96:27.99]So what?
[96:28.55]He dragged you into this?
[96:31.64]So why didn't he give you up?
[96:34.34]You think I'm stupid enough to deal with an asshole like that myself?
[96:41.70]But enough talk, Frank.
[96:44.18]I had a feeling you'd show up.
[96:46.86]So I prepared a little toy for you.
[96:49.52]I hope I don't have to do this from the very back of that last cutscene or whatever.
[96:55.10]There's a price for everything, Frank.
[96:58.36]And you're about to pay it.
[97:00.32]I hope this is the checkpoint.
[97:03.71]Alright.
[97:05.33]Let's go.
[97:05.61]Well...
[97:16.00]Good pick!
[97:22.70]I got a lightsaber.
[97:25.53]Alright, so let me see.
[97:26.35]Should I shoot the arm?
[97:33.95]Shoot the eye.
[97:35.53]Shoot the lights.
[97:38.11]Shoot the eye.
[97:46.45]Can I climb anywhere?
[97:52.51]Maybe just lightsaber the arm?
[97:56.43]Oh, well, you gotta take off the armor first!
[97:58.85]Alright, I get it.
[98:02.69]I don't get it, but it's okay.
[98:03.47]What do we do with the rockets?
[98:08.70]Just throw them away, I guess?
[98:16.92]It's definitely lightsaber.
[98:23.24]And you gotta get close to knock off the armor.
[98:25.70]Alright, well you gotta do it right.
[98:38.22]Oh!
[98:39.20]Alright, good.
[98:42.95]What's gonna happen now?
[98:48.92]No!
[98:50.58]I don't know how anyone decided I had infinite drink.
[98:55.27]You guys lie to me.
[98:56.03]I don't have infinite drink.
[99:04.41]Alright, let's get this off of me.
[99:13.04]Come on.
[99:24.60]I don't have any more heals.
[99:26.90]There's probably heals in, like, a box up there, right?
[99:28.64]Get that off.
[99:34.85]There it is!
[99:37.43]Alright, box.
[99:37.99]Looking for heals in a box.
[99:40.31]Crate?
[99:40.69]There's a military crate right here.
[99:41.95]There's nothing in that.
[99:47.36]Oh, fuck.
[99:47.80]Yeah, there is.
[99:48.30]Look at this!
[99:56.01]I don't want to pick up the stools!
[100:07.35]Can I?
[100:07.69]I'm gonna have to shoot them off.
[100:12.49]You still made it through.
[100:16.93]Get the fuck outta here.
[100:30.61]What's a queen gonna do for me right now?
[100:31.91]Eat that!
[100:37.06]Oh shit!
[100:40.00]What's left to destroy on your arm?
[101:08.10]I have no more food.
[101:12.86]There's nothing in there?
[101:14.02]There we go.
[101:23.61]Oh shit.
[101:32.58]Don't kill me.
[101:33.18]I'm about to run out of time too, yeah?
[101:41.01]I'm dead.
[101:45.85]Okay.
[101:46.99]So, we have to take out the... Where is this?
[101:57.33]Where is this putting me?
[102:04.90]Why is this putting me all the way back here?
[102:09.17]The damn game has checkpoints everywhere, and you wouldn't put one before, like, the last boss.
[102:13.57]Why is it, why is it back here?
[102:15.31]Alright, I'm gonna keep going.
[102:28.90]The lightsaber is alright.
[102:31.70]Actually, this is not that bad.
[102:34.78]Alright, shoot off stuff.
[102:38.70]That's actually... I'm not in a terrible position.
[102:40.58]Here we go.
[102:43.12]I understand what happens now if we gotta dodge, shoot.
[102:53.06]Actually, that actually sucks.
[102:54.94]That really sucks.
[102:57.09]The gun is absolutely pointless.
[103:12.19]Bring the stool.
[103:12.97]If the stool works better than the lightsaber, I'll be so angry.
[103:20.03]Only one of those hits.
[103:29.81]Gonna do it.
[103:35.09]Gonna do the angry thing to do.
[103:37.53]Okay.
[103:41.01]Bring it down again.
[103:51.72]Got greedy.
[103:53.26]Rockets.
[104:15.40]Alright, I'm going to stop reading chat because somebody just wrote wubba lubba dub dub.
[104:20.30]Like, that's going to help.
[104:33.87]Like, that's going to help.
[104:38.25]Thanks for the help.
[104:50.32]Come on, swing it down.
[104:52.48]No more rockets.
[104:53.20]What is Phase 2 even gonna be?
[104:55.94]She's gonna, like, inject herself!
[105:06.59]Lightsaber's almost broken.
[105:07.45]All I have is the Defiler after this.
[105:09.29]Hopefully it can last.
[105:14.71]Uh-oh.
[105:18.21]Alright, here we go.
[105:18.93]Phase 2?
[105:27.32]Now what?
[105:27.64]I don't know what that means.
[105:30.22]Okay.
[105:31.10]Uh... Clap.
[105:36.26]Clamp, clamp.
[105:36.96]And then... Got it.
[105:38.08]And then... Okay, that's how it goes.
[105:40.44]It goes clap, clamp, clamp, clamp.
[105:46.41]I'm so scared to go in.
[105:52.27]This thing is really fucking slow.
[106:05.98]boxes now.
[106:08.10]Plant, plant, plant, and in the middle.
[106:20.65]Is this thing almost broken too?
[106:21.97]What?
[106:22.65]I'm gonna have to kill it with a stool.
[106:30.21]Plant, plant, in the middle.
[106:40.00]I hope I can kill this thing with this duel.
[106:41.48]What if I run out of objects?
[106:48.94]Okay, dodge.
[106:50.60]Right in the middle.
[106:52.18]Come on, plant, plant!
[106:52.96]Middle.
[106:54.30]Take a picture?
[107:18.99]Got it.
[107:20.07]No!
[107:27.43]Shit.
[107:28.59]I need a new weapon.
[107:30.31]What's this?
[107:32.23]I was trying to take a photo.
[107:34.97]Alright, give me a stool.
[107:36.03]Give me a stool.
[107:36.67]Vodka and a stool.
[107:38.49]Okay, I'm fine.
[107:39.39]Right in the middle.
[107:46.21]Here it is.
[107:50.03]It's already broken.
[107:50.83]Fuck.
[107:50.93]Is that not hurting you?
[108:00.63]Got it.
[108:01.31]Oh shit.
[108:08.58]Oh my god.
[108:09.48]Okay, I gotta slow down.
[108:15.10]I'm like panicking for no reason.
[108:24.14]That doesn't hurt you.
[108:24.82]That doesn't hurt.
[108:25.36]That doesn't hurt.
[108:25.94]I just don't ever shoot the gun.
[108:27.68]Now the stool.
[108:30.50]Knife.
[108:32.21]Stool.
[108:34.41]Get the fucking stool.
[108:35.05]Pick it up.
[108:38.33]I'm almost out of time.
[108:39.31]I'm almost out of time.
[108:40.15]Time's about to be over.
[108:44.53]No.
[108:45.07]God damn it.
[108:46.19]I'm out of time.
[108:51.29]Do it.
[108:51.83]Do it.
[108:52.21]Do it.
[108:52.54]Do it.
[108:57.01]Don't... Just please plant down.
[109:00.59]I need to hit you like three more times.
[109:03.47]Go down into the ground.
[109:08.07]Oh.
[109:08.59]My.
[109:09.29]Fucking.
[109:09.83]God.
[109:11.55]Go down into the ground so I can hit you.
[109:14.23]What is it doing?
[109:15.37]What's going on?
[109:23.96]Use the gun?
[109:24.50]It's not doing anything!
[109:27.42]The gun's not doing anything!
[109:28.86]No!
[109:37.10]Dude, I was literally shooting the weak part of the claw.
[109:45.83]And it did no damage.
[109:56.36]See you later, Frank!
[109:57.52]I hope you get some great POV shots at the firebombing!
[110:07.79]I had an electric stick.
[110:08.99]The electric stick only had... It was red.
[110:11.89]Did I... Did I lose or what?
[110:34.31]Okay.
[110:34.71]Well, that's my ending, apparently.
[110:44.99]Alright.
[110:45.69]There's no record of the shelter dwellers having made it out of the city.
[110:48.28]Sure.
[110:48.58]Reload.
[110:55.48]Reload it.
[111:00.29]Of course they give you two stools and a knife.
[111:03.44]Like, there's nothing else back there that could be put back there.
[111:07.36]No, two stools and a knife.
[111:10.17]Why is there not a fucking, like, pipe or something?
[111:12.87]Why is there stools?
[111:14.27]Why would you put stools back there?
[111:28.70]I can't skip.
[111:29.32]I can't skip.
[111:29.96]Okay.
[111:30.14]How's that one back up?
[111:57.34]Before I go in there, I'm gonna bring... I'm ditching every gun I have.
[112:01.66]I'm not bringing a single firearm into that fight.
[112:05.12]I'm gonna bring as many melee weapons as possible.
[112:11.68]They just do so much more damage.
[112:14.04]He's gonna hit the hand.
[112:22.96]The guns were... Yeah, but why would I bring six guns when they do, like... They don't do any damage.
[112:32.41]You see how much damage I was doing with the Defiler?
[112:34.07]That thing was taking, like, fucking 10% per swing, folks.
[112:40.56]Why wouldn't I just bring, like, a rake?
[112:46.34]Alright, which one is it?
[112:49.46]This one down here.
[113:00.59]Give me a fucking rake.
[113:02.07]I want a rake!
[113:04.97]I'm ready.
[113:07.07]Check this shit out.
[113:10.91]Alright.
[113:11.93]2x4 and a knife.
[113:14.41]2x4 and a rake.
[113:17.39]2x4 and a battery.
[113:21.11]2x4 and a lawnmower.
[113:22.91]But I'm not gonna use that.
[113:23.95]Just bring the 2x4.
[113:24.51]Knife and...
[113:30.50]Uh, I have the lightsaber.
[113:31.82]I have the defiler.
[113:32.76]I have this knife.
[113:34.96]Rake?
[113:35.23]I think that'll be alright.
[113:37.93]Battery and mask.
[113:39.53]Head and battery.
[113:40.21]How do I take the head off?
[113:43.53]I can't remove my head.
[113:48.63]Rake and battery.
[113:49.35]Let's try rake and battery.
[113:50.38]Alright, let's do it.
[114:00.51]Alright, now I'm gonna use this to get there.
[114:02.27]I'm gonna bring a 2x4, just in case.
[114:07.26]Alright, I'm ready.
[114:10.50]Let's get the hell out of here.
[114:12.16]Actually, no, I have to walk with this.
[114:14.28]Alright, fine, fuck it, let's go.
[114:34.97]Get away from me!
[114:36.05]Ehh!
[115:02.74]Alright, here we are.
[115:04.44]Same deal.
[115:12.01]Why are you dropping the rake?
[115:15.31]Why are you dropping the rake?
[115:18.27]Oh, I jumped and landed and somebody touched my foot.
[115:21.43]Whoops.
[115:42.44]Oh my god, it's gone?
[115:44.82]Like, why do you keep doing this to me?
[115:49.38]Why are you doing that?
[115:55.48]Alright, it's over!
[116:00.32]Let's go!
[116:10.20]See?
[116:10.78]Why would I shoot a gun right now?
[116:16.29]Can you please get up?
[116:19.05]Leave me alone!
[116:20.71]Please!
[116:22.01]Thank you!
[116:22.55]Look at this shit!
[116:35.10]You kidding me?
[116:51.07]Got it.
[116:53.23]Taking an erotic picture of Rake.
[116:54.59]Hey, will you settle down?
[117:09.12]Look at that.
[117:09.44]Already in phase two.
[117:19.67]Let's do it.
[117:20.53]Come on.
[117:24.20]Clap, clap.
[117:24.92]Middle.
[117:26.92]Clap, clap.
[117:28.24]Right there.
[117:29.42]See how good this is.
[117:35.32]So good.
[117:35.90]That's insane.
[117:37.45]I'm so glad I did not bring any guns.
[117:44.61]Right through the middle.
[117:54.91]Clap, clap, into the middle.
[117:56.03]No, stop.
[117:56.77]What's this RNG dog shit?
[118:21.37]Oh my god, did you hear what he just did?
[118:22.76]Do it!
[119:09.14]That gun was doing it instead.
[119:18.68]What do I do?
[119:19.80]What do I do?
[119:21.98]I have to use a gun.
[119:23.76]How is this possible without a gun?
[119:25.42]Just blow down.
[119:26.36]She's gonna, like, bury her head into the ground.
[119:33.90]Now what?
[119:34.66]Activate the rack?
[119:37.45]What the fuck just happened?
[119:38.87]Why, did I activate missiles?
[119:41.45]Oh fuck!
[119:44.57]Fight Stacy!
[119:48.53]What?
[119:55.70]Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[120:00.14]I have to get back up there.
[120:01.66]Okay, that was very fast.
[120:06.58]Just get up there.
[120:07.90]What?
[120:08.12]He's stupid.
[120:14.62]Can I not activate this one?
[120:16.16]I can't jump over the arm.
[120:19.87]Wait, just slow down.
[120:21.77]Give me the orange juice.
[120:27.89]I'm running out of time.
[120:28.65]I have about like 12 minutes.
[120:36.08]I don't wanna pick up the fucking stool.
[120:40.83]Okay, fight Stacy!
[120:46.89]Let's go!
[120:48.23]Let's go, please!
[120:52.50]Activated!
[120:54.60]Okay, here we go!
[121:04.99]It's a good thing she's an idiot.
[121:07.06]Oh god, man.
[121:09.78]Did I lock it?
[121:11.30]I think it's locked.
[121:12.34]I can't do anything anymore.
[121:19.59]I think it's over.
[121:24.53]Do I have to go to the other one?
[121:27.68]This is fucking outrageous, man.
[121:34.65]Are you coming?
[121:48.24]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[121:50.32]No, I have to halt.
[121:50.94]I have to stop.
[121:51.52]Pause the game.
[121:52.04]Pause the game.
[121:52.34]Pause the game.
[121:52.64]Pause the game.
[121:53.00]I have to do this again.
[121:57.34]It's alright.
[121:57.66]The rake is...
[122:04.54]As a phase three?
[122:06.22]Oh my fucking god.
[122:09.52]The rake was perfect.
[122:10.61]Just use the rake and then you have to jump from platform to platform and activate the fucking terminal.
[122:34.45]God damn it.
[122:38.22]I blame everybody that told me to make the hat.
[122:41.48]Because I'm just drinking booze and it's fucking ruining everything.
[122:48.08]Alright, let's go.
[122:49.74]Rake.
[122:50.76]Fast.
[122:51.46]Nothing matters.
[122:52.51]I only need a rake.
[122:54.23]Rake.
[122:55.65]And battery.
[122:57.19]Let's go.
[122:59.01]Save time.
[122:59.61]That's the only item that matters.
[123:05.88]Check it out.
[123:07.06]Watch this.
[123:08.25]Save the game right now.
[123:11.63]Please get the beard trimmer out of the way.
[123:15.63]We're going in slot 1.
[123:18.12]Let's go.
[123:22.50]Why save?
[123:23.00]So I don't have to make this ever again.
[123:37.00]Stun mechanics in games like these make me want to puke blood Just reload just reload the goddamn game this is unbelievable
[124:05.00]I could drown myself back in this.
[124:20.51]There's a zombie on top of me, and I think I take more damage when a random person swipes at me running through the crowd.
[124:31.04]Why is it like this?
[124:44.68]Here comes a 45-minute sex scene.
[124:47.26]There are no sex scenes!
[124:53.95]There's no shame in restarting with my current level.
[124:57.08]That would be a really good idea if I wasn't in the last, like, 12 minutes of the whole game.
[125:09.76]If I were to go to the very beginning now... Oh.
[125:11.77]Uh-oh.
[125:12.99]It wouldn't take that long to rush?
[125:14.21]No.
[125:14.85]No, no, no.
[125:15.93]I got it.
[125:16.39]I got it.
[125:16.71]I got another mechanic.
[125:19.39]Pretty clean run, by the way.
[125:21.73]This is a good checkpoint.
[125:23.19]By the way, if it looks like I'm going to lose, I'm just going to quit.
[125:28.33]Make another rake.
[125:28.93]I can only hold one at a time.
[125:32.38]If I make a second rake, it's not going to work.
[125:36.44]I'm going to bypass Pretzel.
[125:37.82]I don't need it.
[125:45.56]Here we go.
[125:46.00]Clean.
[125:51.04]Go for the heart here.
[125:53.22]Good.
[125:55.21]No, I don't need the pretzels.
[126:12.24]I should not take damage in this first phase.
[126:14.04]Maybe the second one, but not this one.
[126:21.57]That did so much damage that it hurt his hand and he pulled it back.
[126:24.93]Good.
[126:35.21]Good.
[126:35.71]Good.
[126:39.05]I'll get a few photos, don't worry.
[126:47.57]Nope.
[126:48.31]Ah, bad.
[126:48.84]Give me that second phase.
[126:54.74]Give me that second phase!
[127:07.11]Phase two, let's go.
[127:10.83]Nobody touch anything?
[127:18.54]Give me some good RNG here.
[127:19.65]I need it.
[127:25.31]That's not good RNG.
[127:26.33]It's bad RNG.
[127:29.01]That's also very bad RNG.
[127:30.59]50% on the first swing.
[127:44.08]Alright, the rake's almost done.
[127:56.25]Time to toss.
[127:58.50]Nice.
[127:58.84]Come on, do it again.
[128:01.74]Bang, bang, bang.
[128:02.50]Right here.
[128:04.80]Ooh, it went a little too far.
[128:05.92]It's alright, I'll get it on the next run.
[128:11.33]One more.
[128:11.59]Alright, one more and then, oh.
[128:14.55]Good on you, Gene.
[128:17.77]Alright, let's go.
[128:30.10]clean.
[128:31.06]This time, it's a QTE fight.
[128:34.02]Don't fuck it up.
[128:40.45]Got it.
[128:41.61]It's okay.
[128:41.97]I got it, right?
[128:42.45]QTE.
[128:59.81]Did I do it?
[129:01.23]Okay.
[129:01.89]Let's go!
[129:04.91]Oh, it hurts.
[129:28.32]One more!
[129:29.64]What do I have for alcohol?
[129:30.70]No, orange juice!
[129:31.68]Just take it slow.
[129:32.38]Orange juice.
[129:33.78]Don't drink any booze.
[129:37.36]Don't aggro.
[129:37.84]Okay.
[129:54.05]Why can I not activate this?
[129:57.83]What happened?
[129:59.05]Alright, back to one, back to one, back to one, back to one.
[130:32.39]No softlock for me.
[130:35.73]I thought I was going to screw that up.
[130:46.45]On that last one, it got kind of scary.
[131:01.31]Looks like you're a little out of your league, boy.
[131:04.25]It's Agent S. I'm ready for extraction.
[131:21.98]Yeah, I just have an old newspaper that needs to be taken out to the trash.
[131:36.03]That's such an anti-clavactic way to die in a game like this.
[131:43.37]It's just like... Not even any like... Or like... No, you're just instantly dead.
[131:53.22]Dead, dead, dead.
[132:05.27]I need rescue choppers.
[132:07.99]And I need them right now.
[132:11.60]Before that firebombing begins.
[132:14.16]Wait, what do you mean before the firebombing begins?
[132:19.40]How many hours are left before the firebomb begins?
[132:25.24]Okay.
[132:25.58]I thought I had to get to the roof again.
[132:35.85]Have the bodies been loaded?
[132:38.07]What about TK?
[132:43.86]We can't wait any longer!
[132:45.12]Get back on the chopper!
[132:46.76]Hang on, I gotta go get TK!
[132:48.62]He's got a lot to answer for!
[133:06.77]Go get TK.
[133:12.03]Where is he?
[133:41.29]Wait, where's she?
[133:46.68]Stern to a zombie?
[134:29.48]What did I just do?
[134:44.17]I skipped it.
[134:44.71]Yeah, but I didn't think I was gonna do that.
[134:50.01]Did I skip the cutscene too?
[134:51.31]No.
[134:56.67]No, we're here.
[134:57.91]Ladies and gentlemen!
[135:04.84]It's Frank West!
[135:08.36]Famous zombie killer!
[135:10.76]A little prone to losing women, though.
[135:15.96]TK!
[135:16.36]Thanks for the thumb, Rex Frankie.
[135:20.34]You know what?
[135:22.20]You should've checked out your lady friend's body a bit more carefully.
[135:27.10]He actually said it over time.
[135:33.72]He actually said it.
[135:36.92]Is this a dig at the first game, having like a gigantic fetch quest to end the game?
[136:05.41]Compromising photo.
[136:09.25]Oh man, look at all this shit.
[136:10.91]Alright, it's pee time.
[136:12.93]I gotta get up and stretch.
[136:13.75]I'm gonna pee.
[136:15.18]I'll be back in like two or three minutes.
[136:18.32]Stretch your legs, we'll be right back for overtime.
[136:40.01]Thank you.
[137:28.76]you
[138:58.11]So, instead of doing overtime, I was probably, I was thinking about, uh, thinking of going back to the save where I lost Juan, and just going from there.
[139:07.29]I felt kind of really bad about it.
[139:08.43]Uh, I missed Core, during that little final boss there, CoreMonster gave 20 community subs.
[139:16.31]Thank you for this huge sub drop, CoreMonster.
[139:20.43]I missed it, but, let's touch upon it now, that's a lot of people.
[139:29.10]I have plenty of Zombrex.
[139:31.84]So that's good.
[139:32.42]You have to do a perfect run.
[139:37.66]There's no way I'm doing that.
[139:38.60]Alright, so let's go.
[139:40.33]Zombrex stat.
[139:41.31]I'm going to go... Start on the top right.
[139:48.03]Start over here at... Painkillers.
[139:52.77]I'm going to go all the way around.
[139:54.15]Oh, what's the one right next to me here?
[139:55.31]We'll go this way.
[139:58.63]Compromise... Find the compromising photo.
[140:02.63]Let's do it.
[140:07.38]What?
[140:08.92]Okay, that was strange.
[140:10.60]That was very weird.
[140:18.60]So what does it look like now, outside?
[140:28.68]I'm so happy.
[140:30.44]Dead Rising 1.
[140:31.94]Overtime.
[140:32.56]True ending.
[140:33.16]Dead Rising 2.
[140:34.14]Overtime.
[140:34.70]True ending.
[140:35.36]No resets!
[140:50.97]Time?
[140:52.71]Yeah, I'm just going for it.
[141:00.44]Are they military everywhere like there was in the first one?
[141:04.80]There's only one reason why I would be upset at this game.
[141:07.74]And it would be if it was just a carbon copy of Dead Rising 1.
[141:12.57]When it was just people's... Okay, it's not.
[141:14.35]I don't think it is.
[141:22.74]I can still gamble too.
[141:23.60]That'd be kind of funny.
[141:28.86]Compromising photo.
[141:33.17]Where is it?
[141:35.37]Okay.
[141:41.10]Got it.
[141:41.50]What the hell was that?
[142:03.68]Alright, let's go to Zombrek's Stash.
[142:05.60]That's the next one, right?
[142:09.92]Where is this one?
[142:10.72]Is it up?
[142:12.58]It's down.
[142:13.18]Okay.
[142:13.44]It's in the garage.
[142:16.47]Underground tunnels!
[142:28.49]Check the photo.
[142:33.61]Yeah, I haven't looked at the photos in a long time.
[142:35.49]This one sucks.
[142:41.68]This one really sucks.
[142:49.50]Oh, right.
[142:49.92]That's when I almost threw a grenade at these two.
[142:59.38]Who's standing there?
[143:00.24]That's strange.
[143:03.13]Whose boobs are these?
[143:04.07]No, okay, that's the bum.
[143:05.42]I don't know why I took a photo with this.
[143:10.90]Half of these are just on accident.
[143:23.88]I never got rid of the snipers, either.
[143:25.30]Ah, that's important.
[143:31.12]Is this one saved?
[143:34.24]Wait, I'm sharing these.
[143:35.91]I don't want to share them.
[143:39.45]I just want to lock them.
[143:53.18]This one sucks.
[143:55.52]This one sucks.
[143:58.00]Oh, that.
[143:58.42]I was trying to throw it at it and hit her in the head.
[143:59.98]And right when I hit her, take the picture.
[144:01.16]That one sucks.
[144:03.97]That would've... It was a good one before, when he got run over by the thing.
[144:14.82]These are just, like... I need to get rid of the... Okay, the people hugging photos just don't need to be saved.
[144:27.14]Okay, cool.
[144:32.01]Zombrek's stash.
[144:34.08]He hates when people are in love with him.
[144:37.08]There's no reason to have him.
[144:42.02]Do you guys really think that Disney World keeps all the photos of you going down the crest of the roller coaster?
[144:48.34]No.
[144:49.02]The second that you don't want to buy it, they delete it.
[144:51.98]Wait, where am I going?
[144:54.06]I'm going the right way.
[145:03.87]Am I not going the right way?
[145:04.79]What's happening here?
[145:08.93]I'm going the right way.
[145:10.25]Right?
[145:13.27]Yeah.
[145:13.99]Oh, I gotta go underground!
[145:19.43]They sell the photos to the government.
[145:23.25]If you really think the government wants you going down Splash Mountain... I mean, I don't know what to tell you.
[145:34.00]Where are they storing all this stuff?
[145:40.96]So you're telling me that the government has a photo of everybody when they've ever gone down Splash Mountain.
[145:45.01]What hard drive is this on?
[145:56.28]Just Disney photos alone is probably...
[146:01.11]7,000 to 10, probably like 55,000 petabytes or something.
[146:04.24]It's down in the cloud.
[146:05.32]I'm gonna pick up the queen.
[146:26.86]Queen's here.
[146:27.40]Just give it to me.
[146:28.02]Give it to me.
[146:29.36]Yes.
[146:30.52]Oh man.
[146:31.58]Oh man.
[146:32.34]That's how you get somebody upset That's how you get somebody really upset what just happened right there That car
[146:59.56]And imagine being the government employee that goes through those?
[147:04.00]It's... That would be the most boring fucking job ever.
[147:09.98]It's just going over hundreds of millions of going down the Splash Mountain.
[147:16.37]Photos.
[147:16.99]For what?
[147:17.41]What are you storing them for?
[147:18.93]What would you have to have that for?
[147:28.13]For face recognition.
[147:38.80]I mean that.
[147:43.74]It's fun for the police?
[147:45.10]Wait, what?
[147:48.74]Alright, we gotta get the staff.
[147:52.73]I grabbed again.
[147:54.39]I swear.
[147:55.45]I need to heal now, too.
[148:05.22]What is this?
[148:05.78]Oh, it's in the train.
[148:13.28]I can't just climb this.
[148:23.93]I know I'm going to puke.
[148:32.67]That's kind of my light signal.
[148:34.09]That's good.
[148:37.35]I kind of don't need this magazine anymore.
[148:38.71]It's useless to me.
[148:40.53]I dropped the helmet?
[148:41.23]Yeah, because I puked and I don't want it anymore.
[148:52.74]Here we go.
[148:54.38]Zombrex is back.
[148:55.26]Yeah, too bad we won't get a chance to use it.
[148:57.89]Oh, I'm going to need me some Zombrex from now on.
[149:01.75]Good thing Phenotrans left a nice little gift basket full of it.
[149:09.40]What do you guys think your CIA profile looks like in the photo regard?
[149:14.18]Do you really think there really just is, like, 600,000 photos of you?
[149:19.23]Imagine getting that, like, on the drive.
[149:20.63]They're just like, here, here's every photo.
[149:26.49]It's just you walking down some street.
[149:31.17]Got his mic?
[149:31.75]No, keep my mic on!
[149:36.68]Alright, where do I need to go?
[149:37.88]I need a car or something.
[149:41.98]Car, motorcycle.
[149:42.64]You guys are extra grabby right now.
[149:53.25]You guys are just extra grabby.
[150:08.36]Oh, for the love of God, just kill them quickly.
[150:11.46]They're not gonna stop.
[150:12.46]They're never gonna stop, so why not just get rid of them?
[150:23.68]I fucking hate that cop mechanic.
[150:26.46]I hate it.
[150:37.53]He hates it.
[150:38.39]He does.
[150:39.15]He does hate it.
[150:47.01]I got it, don't worry.
[150:58.12]Okay, I'm just making sure I'm going the right way.
[151:00.82]The GPS freak the fuck out.
[151:44.19]I'm ready.
[151:46.28]And... Amplifier and gun.
[151:51.50]Amplifier and flashlight.
[151:54.80]Amplifier and defiler.
[151:56.14]Amplifier and beer.
[151:57.02]Amplifier and this thing.
[151:58.67]Nope.
[152:03.53]I don't have the BFG.
[152:04.49]No, I don't.
[152:06.11]Sad.
[152:15.46]Motor Oil.
[152:16.16]I never use this for anything.
[152:17.26]What should I do with this?
[152:27.20]Drink it.
[152:27.56]You can't drink Motor Oil.
[152:31.44]You should check the combo page in all caps.
[152:43.29]There's a lot of info here.
[152:46.82]What else can I do with the computer?
[152:47.82]I don't see motor oil anywhere.
[152:53.98]There's no motor oil on this list.
[152:55.98]So the person that screamed at me... I'm gonna scream back.
[153:10.87]Spray paint.
[153:14.46]And a knife.
[153:16.64]Eh.
[153:33.23]Another handgun.
[153:33.98]Alright, I'm going to waste one of these.
[153:36.06]Handgun and spray paint.
[153:49.89]pipe and... What am I looking for now?
[153:55.42]Right here.
[153:56.58]Alright.
[153:57.06]Expensive champagne.
[154:00.26]I have to get out.
[154:08.80]Just trying to run around so I don't get hit anymore.
[154:36.59]Turn off the face cam?
[154:38.73]I don't have one.
[154:54.06]Wait.
[155:00.46]Orange juice and beer.
[155:05.94]Some nectar.
[155:09.28]Uh... Orange juice and orange juice.
[155:13.38]No.
[155:14.56]Is that a waste?
[155:15.38]I feel like I want these orange juice- No, whatever, just do it.
[155:18.22]How the hell do I care?
[155:27.50]That's a great thing.
[155:28.88]Just cover yourself in pain.
[155:38.82]Handgun.
[155:39.38]I don't need anything.
[155:40.42]Beard.
[155:40.78]Double beard.
[155:47.84]I can't fucking believe what his strength does.
[155:49.66]I was trying to punch.
[155:52.86]Clip it.
[155:53.50]I want you to clip that.
[155:54.21]Clip that because there was nothing in my retry.
[155:56.45]Clip it.
[155:56.87]Go look at it.
[155:57.69]Go look at it.
[155:58.67]I wanted to punch this guy.
[155:59.49]There was nothing in the inventory.
[156:00.51]Go clip it.
[156:00.85]I want you to look at it.
[156:24.97]Alright, get me out of this.
[156:27.93]Wait, there's a beer.
[156:29.89]Beer and vodka.
[156:31.55]Let's do it.
[156:33.61]Nectar and queen.
[156:34.60]I can't put queen in there.
[156:37.24]Nectar and queen.
[156:39.14]Wait, let me flush this out.
[156:44.22]Let me flush this out first.
[156:53.57]Get the fuck out of here.
[156:55.21]Okay, so that's... Randomizer.
[156:58.35]Alright, Nectar and Queen.
[157:00.87]If I do this and it's wrong, I'm not gonna spring for two months.
[157:04.13]Okay.
[157:05.99]Are you sure you want me to do this still?
[157:15.49]Good.
[157:17.78]You can't even put the Queen in there.
[157:20.98]See, in two months.
[157:25.73]Look at all these fucking handguns.
[157:27.59]Alright.
[157:28.07]I don't even need this anymore.
[157:31.45]I've been holding onto it for no reason.
[157:46.26]I'll take a shotgun though.
[157:48.00]After I do this.
[157:50.24]Stupid idiot meat on bone.
[157:51.52]Stupid idiot meat on bone.
[157:52.77]Meat on bone.
[157:53.39]Meat on bone.
[157:54.05]Meat on bone.
[157:54.67]Meat on bone.
[158:02.88]Stupid idiot meat on bone.
[158:04.18]Stupid idiot meat on bone.
[158:05.74]I'm just trying.
[158:07.40]Oh, there's the expensive one.
[158:09.74]Mm-hmm.
[158:30.99]Okay, uh, should I do one more?
[158:34.45]Yeah, I'm gonna do one more time, and I'm gonna replace the Queen.
[158:52.32]Queen and Nectar at work, bitch.
[158:59.69]Alright, I'll do Queen and Nectar at the workbench.
[159:02.09]And if it's not real, I'm not gonna stream for like 6 years.
[159:05.45]I'm just gonna come back when I'm like 45.
[159:06.77]Be like, remember me?
[159:11.50]I really got you, right chat?
[159:18.58]Okay, give me that clean back.
[159:20.58]I'm gonna replace the... This thing's pretty much toast anyways, so fuck it.
[159:25.81]Give me the clean.
[159:27.17]Let's go.
[159:36.05]Need a workshop.
[159:36.76]Mmm, there's a bunch on the way.
[159:42.46]But wait.
[159:43.80]There's two right in front of me.
[159:44.80]Let's go get...
[159:48.56]Okay, we got... That's going to be last.
[159:50.84]Let's go get... Let's go get Men's Silk Thong and then come back and do the other ones.
[160:01.03]And anybody that disagrees with what I'm saying is getting a timeout.
[160:11.92]If I swing and miss, and I don't hit a zombie, and you say, like, you swung and missed, LOL, time out.
[160:21.04]This thing's pretty much done.
[160:42.28]Let's do a grenade.
[160:43.87]Fine, yeah, sure.
[160:44.83]Boom.
[160:45.11]I didn't get a chance to see it.
[160:51.15]Let's go.
[160:51.97]Haha.
[161:10.10]Would you guys watch this stream if I was constantly like this?
[161:12.99]Like this?
[161:13.77]Ready?
[161:14.01]Like... No, no, no.
[161:16.79]Shut the fuck up.
[161:17.43]Just shut the fuck up.
[161:20.71]Next person that says anything like that, I'm gonna go... Guys, fucking shut up, guys.
[161:37.14]Fuck.
[161:39.00]Stop, stop, stop!
[161:43.70]Fucking, I swear to god, I hate you guys.
[161:45.60]What if I was like that?
[161:47.31]Are people like that?
[161:57.05]Clip that.
[161:58.49]Yeah, well now you have it forever.
[162:10.10]Anytime I get frustrated in a game, or I get mad about something, I never want to get, like, actually, like... The stream is ruined angry, you know what I mean?
[162:22.83]Because there's a certain line where you just are so upset that, like, the stream is ruined.
[162:28.93]And your day is ruined.
[162:40.29]Mario Tennis.
[162:41.67]Oh, it's upstairs.
[162:45.59]Yeah, I think I've allowed one in five years of streaming.
[162:52.38]I'm not allowed one stream where I'm like, fucking stupid, fucking game's fucking stupid, dumb fucking idiot, fucking game's stupid.
[162:58.92]I'm not allowed one of those?
[163:13.23]Ooh!
[163:13.45]You just used it?
[163:15.21]No, I didn't.
[163:16.06]Alright.
[163:16.58]So that gives us that.
[163:17.08]Let's move.
[163:17.32]What's faster?
[163:36.34]These two last.
[163:37.66]Yeah, we'll go down to the, uh, sutures.
[163:41.86]Change mask, please.
[163:44.85]Fucking not change my fucking mask.
[163:46.39]Fucking stupid fucking thing.
[164:02.71]He's not even trying to string together his sentence.
[164:04.88]Just saying... Just being angry and saying swears.
[164:08.78]Come on!
[164:09.10]Over the top!
[164:09.90]I can't throw him over the top rope.
[164:13.40]What do we got here?
[164:15.44]Randomize it.
[164:15.96]Let's see what it does.
[164:17.96]What does it do?
[164:26.45]Nothing?
[164:27.43]Just puke?
[164:28.31]Nothing.
[164:46.26]We've talked about it a million times before, but there's always a way you can tell when somebody's really mad.
[164:51.16]Instead of talking like this, they drop their voice down like this and they talk kind of fast.
[164:55.89]And they just fucking say, like, this is fucking stupid, I'm not even, this is like seriously fucking dumb.
[165:01.01]You drop down to like normal, I'm talking on the phone voice.
[165:04.13]With like... No, you wouldn't be like that mad, who are you that mad at?
[165:13.68]You're like really, really angry with somebody on the phone.
[165:18.90]What is this?
[165:19.82]Spin the wheel.
[165:22.34]Should I do the wheel?
[165:33.04]I'm going to spin the wheel.
[165:37.05]It's a thousand bucks.
[165:39.59]It's $25,000 to spin this again.
[165:42.93]Oh my goodness.
[165:46.02]I keep detecting over and over and over again.
[165:56.05]I'm just going to spin the wheel until that's gone.
[165:57.73]All my money.
[166:02.96]I'm not sure that's going to happen.
[166:07.28]What's this one?
[166:10.07]Super defense?
[166:20.37]Use the queen.
[166:21.33]No, no, no.
[166:21.95]If I use the queen, so many people are going to write stupid, fucking, dumb, fucking idiot, fucking idiot.
[166:25.93]I'm telling you, I'm not supposed to do it.
[166:28.33]I lost.
[166:35.24]I lose again.
[166:40.36]How do you win?
[166:41.26]I wish I could just play this.
[166:43.22]You know, I really wish I could just play this.
[166:45.58]Instead of being coughed, stun-locked.
[166:48.73]I wish I could just play that.
[166:53.69]I need a weapon.
[166:55.99]Something that's not a surfing tray.
[167:02.07]There should be a fucking internal clock that, like, you can't clock more than once every 20 seconds.
[167:19.70]He's trying to upset me.
[167:24.94]I don't even care.
[167:26.46]I'm just going.
[167:26.86]This is ridiculous.
[167:33.24]Look at how long that lasts.
[167:39.40]It's a full five seconds.
[167:41.58]Fuckin' done.
[167:42.10]Fuckin' stupid.
[167:42.76]Fuckin' a fuckin' thing.
[168:02.60]Here comes a throw-up.
[168:03.52]Don't do it.
[168:05.34]Can I have the weapon?
[168:11.36]Just go over here and go in the maintenance room.
[168:17.70]Okay, guys.
[168:21.05]See you in three months.
[168:22.03]Nope.
[168:22.57]I get a stream.
[168:32.03]Wingman.
[168:36.25]What does it do?
[168:50.03]Where is it?
[168:50.43]Is it the first one?
[168:57.77]Unleash this ruthless wasp against the zombie menace.
[169:02.29]Okay.
[169:04.11]So it's just a... Why is this in here?
[169:11.09]An oil?
[169:13.45]What does this do?
[169:15.77]Sword?
[169:16.33]Training sword and oil.
[169:22.79]Well, that's awesome.
[169:25.87]I'm gonna hold on to that.
[169:29.34]Uh, broom and... Is there a machete you're on?
[169:33.87]Brummin' something else, maybe?
[169:43.58]I just drank the thing.
[169:44.28]I need a good thing.
[169:45.06]Oh, there's one right here.
[169:52.00]I already have one of these.
[169:54.14]I have two.
[169:55.50]I'm not even using them.
[170:00.06]Zombrex.
[170:01.06]Oh!
[170:02.18]Almost didn't do it.
[170:04.49]Oh my god, that would have been so funny.
[170:07.57]Alright, just give me a broom.
[170:14.65]Get it out.
[170:19.93]Then we go all the way out and around.
[170:22.11]Is there a save point in here?
[170:24.78]No, it's out this way.
[170:26.56]Okay!
[170:28.50]I have a weapon!
[170:35.29]Y'all better run!
[170:37.49]Here comes a funny DROBA985 moment.
[170:44.59]There's a rocket launcher.
[170:45.84]Whaaat?
[170:50.86]Where's there a rocket launcher, liar?
[170:52.12]Where?
[171:07.59]Oh, no lies here.
[171:10.98]Not a liar.
[171:13.66]That's a good trait.
[171:14.56]I'm gonna take the sword, too.
[171:21.14]And I'm getting rid of the hat.
[171:26.43]Take a sip and then get rid of it.
[171:30.37]No, I want to throw it.
[171:34.51]Okay, give me my... I've got my sword.
[171:37.28]I've got my rocket launcher.
[171:38.62]Let's move.
[171:39.76]There's a hundred in here.
[171:49.53]This game is sick.
[171:51.43]Seriously, this game is sick.
[171:55.95]Would you guys still stay here and watch if I... Alright, let's find out.
[171:59.03]I'm curious.
[172:14.59]This game's fucking sick.
[172:49.11]I'd like to use these to sew your mouth shut.
[172:51.40]Well, I see you found some sutures.
[172:53.56]Now, if you're good, maybe we can use them to close up your girl's wounds.
[172:59.40]Sick.
[173:35.22]I was gonna say, somebody said in the chat, I was gonna go, yo, this is dope.
[173:40.89]That's it.
[173:49.82]Alright, we need gauze.
[173:52.58]Save it!
[173:54.66]Do a rocket jump?
[173:56.30]Now that'd be cool if we could.
[173:58.26]Dynamite.
[174:00.02]Have to use it.
[174:06.13]Not bad.
[174:06.71]Not bad.
[174:11.32]Come on.
[174:45.62]Am I stuck in here?
[174:49.40]I just look over and I see that now.
[174:55.47]I can't get out of this!
[175:02.44]I really can't leave with this.
[175:04.34]Can I throw it?
[175:10.27]No, throw it backwards like this.
[175:19.50]Throw it!
[175:28.57]Why won't he throw it now?
[175:34.46]It's getting fucking dope.
[175:47.21]Come on!
[175:47.87]Is that close enough?
[175:48.77]What happened to that guy?
[176:00.00]Alright, I'm getting real sick of this thing!
[176:03.56]Give it to me!
[176:04.92]Why can't... Okay.
[176:15.18]Sick!
[176:18.00]That's annoying.
[176:21.62]Why is it annoying?
[176:22.54]Why can I not get this out of here?
[176:24.68]Whatever.
[176:28.80]Sorry, I went down into the waterfall thing.
[176:33.25]Didn't mean to.
[176:33.97]I do want this gun.
[176:44.85]No, I don't.
[176:52.00]jumped into that guy's arm.
[176:54.26]That's how you know it stinks like a turd.
[176:57.19]When I jumped into the guy's hands, like he was waiting for me to jump.
[177:08.51]Alright, they're both right over here.
[177:26.55]I'm gonna go read a book, this is too sick.
[177:30.52]I hope the book is good.
[177:33.74]What is the book?
[177:34.22]You can't leave without saying the book.
[177:35.46]Title.
[177:35.80]What's the title?
[177:59.86]Let's go.
[178:00.98]Flashlight in case I find gems.
[178:02.88]How did I save this guy?
[178:04.26]What was the point of saving this person?
[178:28.05]I could have given that Zombrex to the old lady.
[178:33.62]I'm not very big-brained of you.
[178:43.44]What books do I read?
[178:46.98]I like to have a certain amount of them in my possession at all times.
[178:55.12]Sunday morning cartoon pages, the bazooka Joe bubblegum.
[179:03.21]The back of the glade when I'm taking a shit.
[179:13.72]I don't know what else we got.
[179:20.94]Anything that has ingredients in it?
[179:23.56]The newspaper?
[179:24.22]If the newspaper was still cool, I would get it and read it on the toilet.
[179:43.88]It's just not.
[179:45.92]I don't like the way a newspaper feels.
[179:50.02]When you pick up a newspaper and you touch it, it's like a sandy, weird, awful feeling on your hands.
[179:56.85]I hate it.
[179:57.39]You can almost feel the ink kind of coming off.
[180:09.89]I really don't like it.
[180:10.65]It's a weird thing that I don't like.
[180:15.47]Yes, I also don't like the sound of tape being pulled, and I don't like popping balloons.
[180:21.31]Hey, you found a real weird one.
[180:35.84]Return to the arena.
[180:39.73]Hey, let's try this again.
[180:56.80]Just was not meant to be.
[180:58.08]Ever.
[180:59.66]Where did my sword go?
[181:00.50]The cool one.
[181:11.82]He swung and you missed.
[181:13.54]It's alright.

[182:39.71]Okay.
[182:53.08]That guy was not even paying attention.
[182:54.28]He was looking at his fingernails and he still Instagrammed me.
[183:07.65]He Instagrammed?
[183:08.55]Is that what I said?
[183:11.39]I did not say Instagram.
[183:21.62]Don't forget to save.
[183:31.68]That person just saved the whole stream.
[183:35.61]Seriously.
[183:36.73]If you don't think so, look it up.

[184:29.62]I'll give you facecam in like a week of mine.
[184:34.08]It'll be called Facecam Fridays.
[184:38.17]Remember that was a big deal.
[184:39.07]I used to have a series on YouTube called Facecam Fortress.
[184:46.57]Because that was a big deal to have your face camera turned on during gaming.
[184:54.43]I know a lot of you are laughing right now, but this was like 2011, 2012.
[184:56.63]That was a big deal back in 2011.
[184:57.49]Wait.

[186:24.85]Guys, I just came to the stream, and I don't understand this, like, why people are writing numbers, -2, +2, like, I don't fucking get this stupid fucking thing, it's fucking dumb.
[186:41.90]Like, why don't they just chat, I don't fucking, this stream is fucking dumb.
[186:54.44]Alright, survive.
[187:04.40]I don't have any weapons?
[187:05.46]Alright.
[187:11.66]Climb over there.
[187:12.66]Climb over and kill him immediately.
[187:15.98]He coughed.
[187:16.76]He pre-coughed.
[187:18.53]He pre-coughed on me.
[187:20.17]I'm...
[187:32.09]OH IT BLOWS UP!
[187:48.46]This is my, like, worst nightmare.
[187:49.70]Just being surrounded by these things.
[187:59.73]Fucking awesome.
[188:00.23]Unbelievable.
[188:02.43]Un-fucking-believable.
[188:11.85]Why would I drink that up here?
[188:13.90]I don't know what's going on with my mind.
[188:15.94]Why would I drink that up there?
[188:17.74]I'm so angry about the fucking coffin that it's... it's... malting me.
[188:22.64]I'm malting.
[188:23.76]Not malting, I'm malting.
[188:24.94]I'm gonna drop my skin.
[188:43.08]Uh-oh.
[188:43.40]I need a weapon.
[188:50.30]Stop coughing when you get up on top!
[188:52.24]Oh my god, what is that?
[188:55.17]Oh my fucking god, right?
[188:57.55]I'm not sitting there anymore.
[189:08.67]This is the last time you're gonna hear me say, oh my fucking god.
[189:24.32]What the hell is that?
[189:27.29]What the hell?
[189:37.76]Oops.
[189:38.06]Perfect timing.
[189:58.72]Alright, come on.
[190:04.54]Activate.
[190:06.09]Activate.
[190:09.57]You have to escape?
[190:10.43]No, it said survive.
[190:12.07]5,000 bits from David saved it.
[190:16.03]Thank you for the 5,000 bits of the Jerma.
[190:17.33]Why are you being so mean to me?
[190:18.77]You're making me cry.
[190:20.27]David.
[190:21.37]You're not being mean to me.
[190:25.55]You're fucking sick.
[190:27.24]You're the best.
[190:31.36]Final fight with TK.
[190:33.80]But thank you, David.
[190:39.49]Thanks for the $50.
[190:40.33]That's a lot of money.
[190:42.29]5,000 bits.
[190:42.59]I'll drink to that.
[190:52.63]Jesus.
[190:53.67]No audience participation in this game.
[190:57.97]The show's not quite over, TK.
[191:02.11]Where's the checkpoint?
[191:04.94]What a bad photo.
[191:06.82]That would have been so good.
[191:08.14]He ducked again in the worst possible time.
[191:17.40]What's wrong with Rebecca?
[191:36.51]Stop the bleeding.
[191:44.89]This won't be hard for me.
[191:46.96]You know how I do.
[191:54.08]Rebecca, I'm sorry.
[192:03.82]All I have are pretzels and snacks.
[192:09.24]What, do you have activators?
[192:10.46]Do you have like a fucking scepter that activates the ground?
[192:13.32]This probably looks bad to Rebecca.
[192:39.79]Like, holy shit, dude.
[192:41.29]Like, you can handle this.
[192:42.44]Don't jump in fire.
[192:47.82]Still got it.
[192:48.32]Alright.
[192:48.90]Do you have anything else besides like nails and orange juice?
[193:03.73]I can't.
[193:05.61]I'm trying to get like something out of this box.
[193:10.32]What is this?
[193:10.96]I just need weapons!
[193:20.41]Cement saw!
[193:21.57]Okay, finally!
[193:22.91]I just threw it over the cliff!
[193:45.25]Uh-oh.
[194:04.19]Wrench.
[194:06.31]How did I miss?
[194:22.35]He's dead?
[194:23.51]Is he dead?
[194:29.26]Why would he do that?
[194:33.06]Alright, he's a big wave.
[194:33.96]Alright, I need to heal.
[194:36.94]That's not a heal.
[194:39.60]How do you avoid that shit?
[194:58.47]I need to heal.
[194:59.75]Heal.
[195:00.49]Heal.
[195:01.61]I can't.
[195:01.99]I can't.
[195:02.31]I can't do it.
[195:02.89]I need more healing.
[195:05.70]Oh, he's going to activate this shit.
[195:10.32]How do you reliably get over here without getting killed?
[195:15.32]Archers.
[195:15.74]I don't have... I know, but fuck.
[195:25.31]No, I can see it, but he blows the shit up!
[195:32.69]Oh, that's gonna hit Rebecca!
[196:02.19]How do I prevent it from activating this stuff over here?
[196:06.21]Like, he's just gonna... Here we go, I'm dead.
[196:07.70]Can I, like, jump anywhere?
[196:09.14]Oh, don't.
[196:10.10]Come on, food.
[196:18.53]At least I got to taste it before I died.
[196:26.47]Okay.
[196:27.42]I wonder if there's a... Do I have... How do I... How do I interrupt him from doing that?
[196:32.70]I have to do that whole thing again.
[196:34.20]That's... so aggravating.
[196:42.36]I have to do the whole arena thing, just the stand-around arena thing again.
[196:50.53]Why?
[196:55.99]I'm so mad by this that it's making me go the wrong way.
[196:59.84]So before I fought that guy, somebody said this is the worst boss in the game.
[197:07.68]I can see why.
[197:10.35]Not because of how hard he is to fight, but because I have to do this again.
[197:14.67]Does anybody know where that guy was?
[197:17.51]Where the fuck was that guy?
[197:30.36]He was over there.
[197:35.20]God damn it.
[197:36.56]Alright, I'm gonna try to save this stuff.
[197:38.36]I'm gonna try to hold on to as many weapons as I can.
[197:41.13]I'm just gonna jump around.
[197:42.07]I'm not gonna fight anything.
[197:43.81]Save the pretzels, save the food.
[197:46.75]Save the bat, too.
[197:47.47]I'm gonna try to see if I can get through this without... Oh, I forgot.
[197:51.63]The coffin exists in this game.
[197:53.15]Delete the coffin.
[197:55.60]Right now, like, the developers of this game, like, play this back and they go, fuck, man, we should never play this back.
[198:03.04]Hope nobody notices.
[198:09.88]Come on!
[198:19.39]Come on!
[198:24.64]What a great start.
[198:26.80]Yeah.
[198:35.45]Did anyone know if I just have to activate this, like, three times or something?
[198:43.06]And it's just a time when it's... I figured it would be downtime.
[199:19.68]Saw Saw Saw Saw Saw Saw Saw
[199:28.68]I'm in trouble.
[199:41.78]I'm in trouble.
[199:42.60]Ugh.
[200:06.24]I didn't even want to fall off.
[200:07.32]Is that even going to hurt me?
[200:08.86]Okay, that's three times.
[200:11.36]No, it's not three times.
[200:12.59]It's just time.
[200:15.07]Oh.
[200:16.81]Ladies and gentlemen.
[200:19.93]This is the worst checkpoint ever.
[200:22.09]I don't want to do this again.
[200:23.47]I have to win.
[200:24.49]I don't want to do this again.
[200:28.23]I'm not doing this a third time.
[200:29.19]No human wants to do this a second or third time.
[200:40.74]I know there's, like, computer programs that, like, that do this.
[200:43.03]I don't want to do that.
[200:48.57]Okay.
[200:51.63]I still have not... I don't understand how this works.
[200:58.56]Because when you go too far away... Dodge that.
[201:02.78]It's just...
[201:18.53]Why is he not getting hurt by that?
[201:24.23]Pick up the fucking orange juice!
[201:41.67]Fine.
[201:42.39]Stop.
[201:43.25]I'm tilting.
[201:43.95]What?
[201:49.05]He comes over and does that?
[201:51.29]Why didn't that hit him?
[202:05.14]Okay.
[202:06.22]Let's run around in a circle.
[202:11.00]Until you... I need to heal Rebecca.
[202:13.70]There he goes.
[202:27.18]Does he run to the wall?
[202:28.42]Is this like a Mario game?
[202:39.75]Get over here so I can heal her!
[202:44.46]Just like taunt or something.
[202:56.31]How am I supposed to keep her healed when he never lets up the pressure?
[203:21.67]Heal!
[203:22.31]Oh my god.
[203:42.83]No, no, no, no, no.
[203:43.61]Don't let him kill you.
[203:44.49]Don't let him kill you, Jeremy.
[203:45.82]Don't let him do it.
[203:46.88]He's gonna try.
[204:02.64]Fuck that move.
[204:31.10]I just got Mortal Kombat.
[204:42.23]Alright, Mortal Kombat 2.
[204:49.54]Great.
[205:15.73]Should I just drink a bunch of shit?
[205:22.74]Just use the queen so we can see what it does?
[205:26.16]Guys, I don't even have the queen anymore.
[205:27.98]Alright, let's do it.
[205:43.45]That is as effective as an attack fly from Binding Advisor.
[205:55.52]You don't throw it.
[205:58.58]What else do you do?
[205:59.52]Alright, I'm gonna drink this and run in.
[206:01.44]Drink them all.
[206:15.94]What is it?
[206:16.24]Nothing?
[206:21.85]I only got Painkiller.
[206:22.71]Is this last?
[206:31.47]I guess it's- it worked.
[206:52.32]Get in the shit before we go up.
[207:09.95]Dummy.
[207:10.57]Smokey.
[207:13.82]No, why did you jump that way?
[207:16.06]Okay.
[207:17.00]Okay.
[207:23.88]Get this clean?
[207:25.58]Holy shit.
[207:26.34]Kill everybody.
[207:31.29]I mean, besides the camera freaking me out here.
[207:35.45]Is the camera broken right now?
[207:36.55]I think it is.
[207:39.33]Maybe not.
[207:39.77]Am I out of my mind?
[207:43.13]We're getting to wrestler levels of, I was waiting for you to do that, and we both knew at the same time that you were going to jump in my heart.
[207:48.39]Look at all these Queens, though.
[208:15.95]Why puke?
[208:17.51]Why puke?
[208:18.01]I didn't drink anything.
[208:21.64]Light him up.
[208:30.41]Alright, where's my baseball bat?
[208:34.87]On this one.
[208:39.53]Alright, give me like the beer, give me the bat.
[208:42.45]What else is over here?
[208:43.03]Anything?
[208:43.33]Any secret items?
[208:44.05]Special items?
[208:44.63]Queen?
[208:44.79]This is out of reach.
[208:47.48]I can't get him.
[209:07.21]Oh shit!
[209:17.78]I need the bat.
[209:28.16]Hurry up!
[209:34.98]Okay.
[209:41.27]Let me try this again.
[209:42.97]Goddamn.
[209:44.93]Alright, gotta hit him with the bat.
[209:48.49]And then he'll run away.
[210:03.08]Don't get cocky with this shit.
[210:14.16]This thing's freaking me out.
[210:15.00]Get away from me, B!
[210:33.92]Rebecca, please move your head.
[210:52.13]I want the snacks.
[210:53.27]Why do you gotta do it like that?
[210:55.56]I'm standing in front of it.
[210:57.30]You have to make it so messy.
[211:04.30]I want that, not the three boxes surrounding it.
[211:08.06]How is that so hard to understand?
[211:13.38]Oh my god.
[211:15.22]It just, it like cycles through all of them in a half a second.
[211:18.31]It's like, just fucking stay on one of them.
[211:19.87]Moulding!
[211:52.33]How did you stop halfway?
[211:53.47]Where'd he go?
[211:55.25]Holy shit!
[212:25.03]No!
[212:25.67]Run away!
[212:26.13]Give me that health.
[212:30.57]Come on, run away.
[212:53.03]I got baited.
[212:54.07]Are you kidding me?
[212:54.93]Are you fucking serious?
[213:04.05]Why is he not running away?
[213:26.01]Are you serious?
[213:31.43]Are you serious?
[213:34.05]I'll be back in Dead Rising 3.
[214:04.21]Hey, what do you say you and me go break this story wide open?
[214:21.43]Wasn't that exact same?
[214:22.57]That was just Sonic the Hedgehog 2006.
[214:24.01]Wasn't that happened?
[214:26.87]That's like, there's a frame from that.
[214:28.25]Is that Sonic the Hedgehog 2006?
[214:29.48]Nice try.
[214:31.48]I mean, nice try for a jump scare, but... He almost got me.
[214:36.06]That's like the car commercial thing.
[214:40.20]Almost.
[214:43.11]They waited a long time for that one.
[214:54.42]This is not the Monsters, Inc.
[214:59.77]theme song, although...
[215:16.99]That was good.
[215:17.41]I know a lot of people wanted me to do Dead Rising.
[215:23.96]But there was constant conflict in the chat before I picked this game.
[215:28.00]And sometimes constant conflict is... You know, I'm not even going to try.
[215:33.70]I even bring it up.
[215:34.56]There's no reason to.
[215:35.48]It was constant.
[215:54.12]Anything else after this?
[216:00.46]You said that you were going to do Dead Rising 2 after this.
[216:20.39]That may have been a rage statement.
[216:22.37]Was it?
[216:23.63]Alright, let me ask you a question.
[216:24.87]Before I said that, did I just get grabbed by a zombie?
[216:29.23]Or was that potentially like the fourth retry of a boss?
[216:32.79]Are we sure?
[216:40.48]Okay.
[216:42.46]Why did I say that then?
[216:51.91]Was that like a quell?
[216:53.75]I think that may have been a quell the audience statement.
[216:56.59]No, I'm not gonna stream Dead Rising again tomorrow.
[217:02.26]That took me four hours.
[217:04.48]Let me see what else there is to do here.
[217:06.52]I'm not gonna be Dead Rising ten of the last, like, eleven streams.
[217:22.84]I mean, they're very good.
[217:23.74]They're fun.
[217:24.70]I know you can't hear what I'm saying right now.
[217:27.82]You know what this music sounds like, so let's just turn it off.
[217:36.21]Hi.
[217:37.43]I think you can hear me now.
[217:41.69]So, yeah.
[217:42.57]I'm not doing, like, 10 out of 11 streams.
[217:47.29]I did have rising streams.
[217:54.30]I do want to play Dead Rising 3.
[217:56.43]Just not right now.
[218:00.47]Maybe like in December.
[218:04.59]Somewhere.
[218:07.85]We'll put it somewhere.
[218:08.77]I promise.
[218:12.86]He's never going to play it?
[218:14.16]Yes, I am.
[218:18.48]I said I was never going to play 4.
[218:27.27]Alright, can we get any after credit sequences or anything?
[218:34.40]You said you played Devil May Cry 5.
[218:39.44]yeah but in a world where we're spoiled rotten with millions of probably video games and I'm counting ios like trash can stuff too this there's like thousands and thousands of great experiences it's hard to do them all it's hard you got to find out when you want to do them it's hard I started God of War like two months ago or so I I just haven't I'm like 30 of the way through the game I can't go back

[219:39.03]25 survivors, $4.3 million.
[219:43.07]Would you like to save the game?
[219:44.11]Yes, I would.
[219:49.80]What about the new Star Wars game?
[219:52.66]I don't know.
[219:53.80]There's too many things.
[219:56.44]Let's just go with one.

[220:41.92]Oh, alright.
[220:42.38]Whatever.
[220:42.64]You guys are fucking cool.
[220:51.90]There's no time limit.
[220:52.88]Cray survivors roam the city.
[220:56.68]What?
[220:59.69]I'm going back in.
[221:03.14]Like, I'm the last wrong save.
[221:05.40]Use the existing save.
[221:14.07]Hold on, hold on.
[221:14.91]Alright, I can't just jump over.
[221:29.03]So, load save one?
[221:31.80]That's not going to show us the credits again?
[221:37.09]Oh, well, would you look at that?
[221:38.53]You just... Ah, yeah.
[221:43.61]That's my favorite kind of pasta.
[221:45.61]Angel hair spinach.
[221:46.61]Bad.
[221:46.79]Bad.
[222:04.24]How could angel hair spaghetti be bad when it's the same fucking thing?
[222:08.95]It's all the same thing.
[222:10.59]It's just spaghetti.
[222:11.57]It's just smaller and thinner.
[222:16.05]It's too thin.
[222:17.87]No, I don't want my pasta to soak up all that gross sauce.
[222:23.45]Angel hair pasta.
[222:25.25]A little bit of butter.
[222:26.51]A sprinkle of olive oil.
[222:28.17]That's how they eat it in Italy.
[222:30.07]And that's how I eat it.
[222:35.65]I missed the fucking first part, what was it?
[222:38.57]They s- a little bit of olive oil on the pasta.
[222:40.86]That's how they eat it in Italy!
[222:41.80]Well, how do they eat it in Italy?
[222:57.55]Huh?
[223:01.17]How do they eat it in Italy?
[223:03.55]Hey, you know they made up lasagna for Americans, you know that, right?
[223:09.44]I'm missing important stuff!
[223:35.22]How do Italians eat their food?
[223:37.54]They relax and socialize while dining for hours.
[223:44.48]Over lunch and dinner and coffee, Italians enjoy a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans, fish, poultry, olive oil, tomatoes, whole grains, dairy, red wine, and they eat very little red meat.
[223:57.65]They dine for hours.
[224:03.90]Ugh.
[224:06.42]It's you.
[224:08.58]You guys eat too fast.
[224:10.10]We've already gone over this shit, man.
[224:12.94]We don't have to go over this again.
[224:16.30]Everybody's watching like... Ow!
[224:19.72]Ow, it hurts going in.
[224:20.86]Oh, okay.
[224:24.48]Relax, have a glass of water.
[224:31.37]Okay, here's a challenge.
[224:35.88]Kill as many zombies as you can in 30 seconds.
[224:37.28]40 kills!
[224:41.00]How do I do this this fast?
[225:01.47]I know I wasted time.
[225:03.53]Fuck it.
[225:04.77]This is sandbox mode.
[225:06.05]I just get to let my hair down.
[225:20.60]What hair?
[225:22.10]My hair.
[225:23.14]This is actually kind of cool.
[225:27.30]Alright, let me try it again.
[225:27.98]I gotta get at least 10.
[225:30.46]What's better?
[225:31.04]Baseball bat's probably better.
[225:34.93]Go.
[225:35.01]I'm gonna turn around.
[225:39.64]Great.
[225:40.19]I wonder if there's a gun or something.
[226:06.53]Did I get less than last time?
[226:14.26]I need some- I need a weapon.
[226:15.34]I need some weapons.
[226:17.06]Something better than what I have.
[226:25.26]Why'd I drink that?
[226:27.54]I need a tutor.
[226:28.20]Hey, that was so funny I forgot to laugh.
[226:37.34]That's such an old saying, but how does it make any sense?
[226:42.38]That was so funny, I forgot to laugh.
[226:44.49]Is that a grenade?
[226:48.39]No.
[226:48.51]Because you aren't laughing.
[226:56.61]Why would you forget to laugh?
[227:32.65]Alright, so you probably have to come back up here with better weapons.
[227:37.01]40 people?
[227:38.37]There's no way that's gonna happen.
[227:41.47]Not with a wrench.
[227:42.43]I'm almost dead.
[227:55.43]I forgot.
[227:55.81]Is there a reason why I don't have super health?
[228:08.64]Wait, I have to go to the main menu and start from the main menu.
[228:12.72]Not the costume, though.
[228:18.70]Yeah, this is the right save, otherwise I wouldn't have the costume.
[228:23.00]Right?
[228:24.12]Yeah.
[228:24.86]He doesn't know you can jump on the boxes.
[228:33.03]how did somebody not find it over the last like 16 hours of this game we did no you didn't
[228:55.31]Let's find another challenge.
[228:56.41]I actually kind of like this.
[228:57.51]This is fun.
[228:57.97]Plus, I'm never playing Dead Rising 2 ever again, so, I mean, let's do it.
[229:07.78]What a snack.
[229:15.58]Who the- Gordon?
[229:18.50]Gordon, what are you doing?
[229:21.40]What?
[229:21.62]This guy's just waiting for me.
[229:32.32]It's Gordon!
[229:34.02]I feel like I'm playing... What did you drop?
[229:51.81]He's got money!
[229:52.92]Alright, can you save them?
[229:55.94]Kill 41 more zombies to unlock this challenge.
[230:02.86]That seems like a lot.
[230:16.43]I'm immediately playing the original version to spite you guys.
[230:19.29]Is that what I said?
[230:19.97]That doesn't sound like me.
[230:30.07]I don't know.
[230:30.41]I feel like that doesn't sound like me.
[230:33.81]Well, there's a chain... Okay, well, let's take the chainsaw upstairs.
[230:36.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[230:38.29]Let's do this right.
[230:45.20]No, it's machete and push broom, yeah.
[230:48.92]And then let's do... Just give me the chainsaw.
[230:51.00]I'm gonna go back up and, um... Use the chainsaw and get 40 kills.
[230:57.62]Right?
[230:57.80]Okay.
[231:01.96]I did a second vote.
[231:02.94]But I was already in the game.
[231:04.26]And I already bought the damn thing.
[231:13.09]Paddle and chainsaw?
[231:13.95]Does that work?
[231:18.25]Let's wait till he gets up.
[231:29.62]Paddle and chainsaw.
[231:36.70]Did you say pallet?
[231:42.33]Paddle.
[231:42.89]Where's the paddle?
[231:46.58]Is there a paddle over here?
[231:47.36]There's a paddle on the dumpster.
[231:52.34]Nice eyes.
[231:53.57]Nice eyes.
[231:54.13]Seriously.
[231:58.67]I was away for a while.
[231:59.31]Did he start over?
[232:00.11]Yeah, I got really, really frustrated.
[232:03.11]And, like, I... I was punching my desk and stuff, so I just figured I'd start over.
[232:08.74]Paddle saw.
[232:10.56]Yeah, I know what that does.
[232:14.50]I was punching my desk and going... And fucking tears were just streaming down my face.
[232:21.83]What?
[232:30.78]Should I go back up and just get the 40 one?
[232:31.82]I feel like I can get it easily.
[232:35.19]Okay, it was like screaming and crying.
[232:45.23]It was like... It was really, really embarrassing.
[233:02.68]And then you're like... Alright, 40.
[233:04.36]Let's get it.
[233:08.62]How many are over here?
[233:34.96]Come on, come on, I'm a loser!
[233:39.06]40!
[233:39.89]Gold status.
[233:40.59]I'll take it.
[233:44.01]Why does this guy remind me of Adam Sandler?
[233:49.43]Wait, you're talking about like 1995 Adam Sandler or like 2008 Adam Sandler?
[233:58.93]Boomstick.
[234:02.85]Nice.
[234:05.36]Alright, cool.
[234:07.56]Let's keep going.
[234:13.19]2019 Adam Sandler.
[234:13.87]I'm not sure I agree.
[234:26.58]Holy shit.
[234:35.95]Alright, I want to do the other challenge.
[234:37.77]I don't want to use this yet.
[234:39.21]It's probably kill like 30 zombies in 20 seconds.
[234:53.24]Gain as much PP as you can in 60 seconds.
[235:00.68]It's about to break, yo.
[235:04.52]People saying, you gotta go back to the menu and start in the menu.
[235:07.66]30,000 DP.
[235:08.44]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[235:19.37]I'll be lucky to get private.
[235:34.65]That counts?
[235:38.84]You get a big one.
[235:49.13]Will all these people count?
[235:50.03]They don't very much.
[235:58.57]Go back to the challenge area.
[236:07.01]Alright, I'm gonna start the game from the menu, because everyone's telling me that I somehow did this wrong.
[236:14.69]I have the costume, though.
[236:41.55]Sandbox mode.
[236:54.40]You guys thought I got baited.
[236:55.52]No, I did too.
[236:57.04]I was waiting for it.
[236:57.86]No, that's real.
[236:59.30]Actually, you have to start it from the menu.
[237:02.30]That's the reality.
[237:04.36]I might be able to do this without... Alright, hold on.
[237:11.44]I wonder if I can do it because I'm leveled up.
[237:13.80]Level 33?
[237:14.22]Yeah, let's try it.
[237:27.74]Yeah, that's much better.
[237:29.14]I might not get 40, but...
[237:48.24]I could do it.
[237:49.92]33.
[237:54.16]Oh, my arm just fell back into my chair.
[238:03.03]Oh, without the bat, maybe I can.
[238:11.69]Yeah, I need to... I don't think I can do it.
[238:20.04]Sledgehammer?
[238:21.96]I might be able to spin.
[238:24.95]What's the spin on the Sledgehammer?
[238:29.23]Hmm, maybe.
[238:31.19]Maybe.
[238:33.47]I'm not turning off my facecam.
[238:36.81]You want a facecam?
[238:38.39]No.
[238:40.25]This is way too slow.
[238:43.73]I'm gonna get another one or two at a time.
[238:59.57]This is cool Alright, I think I think I'm gonna it's losing me a little I'm gonna go down.
[239:20.71]I'm gonna go down And see
[239:28.15]I'm gonna go down here and see if I see if it can grab me again after getting to where I was before.
[239:39.84]Let's see.
[239:44.26]I'm glad for the better inventory.
[239:52.35]Yeah, the next game we're playing is Katamar.
[239:54.71]That's the next up on the list.
[240:02.74]Katamari tonight?
[240:03.96]Yes.
[240:05.88]We will at least start Katamari tonight, and we'll keep going tomorrow.
[240:08.99]Because I don't... I'm definitely... Oh, there's Gordon.
[240:13.99]Remember Gordon?
[240:15.19]That's good stuff.
[240:33.24]Oof.
[240:37.14]Big swing.
[240:41.16]Got ya.
[240:51.56]Don't let me do that!
[240:54.40]Okay, 13 more.
[240:55.82]Let's see.
[240:59.60]Knife.
[241:07.11]It's starting to lose me.
[241:08.45]It's losing me.
[241:10.33]Alright, 10 more minutes and we'll see where I am.
[241:17.81]No, let's do the paddle.
[241:28.10]Don't play this for 13 more hours.
[241:30.26]I don't even stream for 13 hours.
[241:34.67]We want Katamari.
[241:35.57]Do you?
[241:35.87]Hold on.
[241:37.67]Just a minute.
[241:38.95]I want to try... This is actually really, really cool, though.
[241:55.09]Alright, let's go.
[241:56.49]I beat the game, got the true ending, got to overtime.
[241:58.83]I looked at the... Katamar.
[242:04.51]Dead Rising 2, off the record, was awesome.
[242:07.22]I suggest you play it.
[242:08.48]Just trying not to get too frustrated.
[242:12.90]Okay.
[242:18.00]I have to switch over to this.
[242:21.72]This might take a minute.
[242:24.50]Beautiful Katamari for the Xbox 3.
[242:26.84]That was a fast 10 minutes, it was.
[242:28.28]I got grabbed, though, and I couldn't handle it anymore.
[242:34.33]It's really easy if you're not an idiot.
[242:37.23]What is easy?
[242:39.81]Are you talking to me?
[242:45.65]Dead Rising 2.
[242:46.11]This game's not easy.
[242:55.46]I'm sorry.
[242:56.64]I ain't gonna have somebody with like their fucking Boy Scout badges of like, I beat Dead Rising 2.
[243:05.75]I get it now too.
[243:06.95]I get to wear that badge.
[243:17.27]Add it to the gamer license.
[243:18.41]Yeah, I guess it's a point.
[243:19.71]No, it's not.
[243:20.11]I don't want points on my license.
[243:27.08]You didn't 100% it.
[243:34.95]Alright.
[243:36.21]Okay.
[243:38.09]Sorry.
[243:44.51]I'll bring my badge back.
[243:46.20]I'll put it on the table.
[243:49.00]I beat the DLC and not the main game badge, which is harder than the original game.
[243:52.90]Do I get a... Thank you.
[243:58.93]I beat the hard one.
[243:59.61]Did you beat the hard one?
[244:06.93]Not canon points.
[244:12.25]Alright, let's get on.
[244:13.48]I'm going to use a different controller.
