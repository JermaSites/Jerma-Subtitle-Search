[00:08.99]Asperdergo.
[00:10.33]No, that's not my name.
[00:11.49]My name is Captain Blackbeard.
[00:17.08]I can't fix it?
[00:18.00]I can't... What?
[00:19.16]I can't be Captain Blackbeard?
[00:20.40]I can be Captain Black Bear.
[00:22.40]That's not happening.
[00:24.80]I've decided to change my name, ladies and gentlemen, for reasons unbeknownst to anybody.
[00:30.17]I'm now going to be Captain Humphries.
[00:36.33]His teeth are so white.
[00:39.35]That's not a pirate.
[00:41.98]Pirates don't have bright white crest commercial teeth.
[00:46.54]No, seriously, this guy's teeth are like perfect.
[00:50.90]What about this guy's teeth?
[00:52.95]They're great.
[00:53.49]This is fucking up my immersion.
[01:01.18]Okay.
[01:02.37]Are you ready for the pirate to attack with his dual blades?
[01:06.77]Yeah, I mean, I guess I could attack you with these.
[01:09.49]Yeah, whatever.
[01:10.23]I don't know.
[01:10.59]I just kind of don't care.
[01:11.55]Did I get you?
[01:13.10]Did I get you?
[01:13.82]I'll just keep walking.
[01:17.42]See, these are like the redcoats.
[01:19.18]It's the British.
[01:20.56]The British are coming.
[01:22.14]Tell Paul Revere.
[01:23.23]Da-da-da-da!
[01:27.19]You British need to leave our lands at once!
[01:30.89]What?
[01:34.47]He doesn't know I'm right here?
[01:36.89]What are they doing to that poor guy?
[01:37.93]That guy's gonna get... What is happening right now?
[01:42.81]Is that a chicken?
[01:44.49]What are these chickens?
[01:45.33]Dude, look at these giant chicken!
[01:48.37]Oh, that's a turtle!
[01:51.93]I thought it was like a turkey!
[01:54.77]I thought it was a turkey.
[01:56.15]Hi, I'm Mr. Assassin Creed man.
[02:02.52]That's a nice big gun you got there.
[02:09.72]Dude, that was sick.
[02:15.46]You all know how it goes.
[02:17.46]I've been captain of this boat for long enough.
[02:19.81]It's time to sing the pirate song that we've been learning since we were two years old.
[02:25.15]And it starts a little something like this.
[02:27.29]The wind at our backs and the sun on the sea.
[02:29.39]None have never been good to me.
[02:31.35]Feel the waves crash through the sky.
[02:33.57]Into the deep air yonder dive.
[02:35.46]Drink in my hand and a trick up my sleeve.
[02:37.44]Looting and plundering's all that I crave.
[02:39.44]Cast on the sails, release the brain.
[02:41.32]Tonight we dive.
[02:42.46]Oh, shit.
[02:43.28]Oh, shit.
[02:47.50]Anybody on this boat have insurance?
[02:50.03]What's insurance?
[02:51.51]Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, go, go.
[02:54.45]You're just a daydreaming office worker.
[02:56.63]That's, like, what this is.
[02:58.53]Assassin's Creed 4 is you're a daydreaming office worker.
[03:03.72]Yeah, my work sucks, you know, but, you know, I'm just gonna sit here at my, like, my cubicle, which is a cubicle.
[03:10.44]I daydream about being a pirate, and they, like, record my daydreams.
[03:16.99]Got ourselves a fight here.
[03:18.63]Got ourselves a fight with the George Washingtons.
[03:21.24]If you guys didn't know, the plot of this game of Assassin's Creed 4 is George Washington cloned himself after the cherry tree incident.
[03:28.32]And now he wants to try to take over the Earth with his George Washington clones, but I ain't gonna let that happen!
[03:34.09]Yeah, get the fuck out of here.
[03:36.63]What about your buddy?
[03:37.77]Your buddy's a fucking gonna get his neck broken too!
[03:40.00]What about this guy?
[03:41.74]Fuck you!
[03:42.12]You're all gonna get your heads punched in!
[03:43.90]You're gonna get your head busted, broke your fucking neck!
[03:46.14]Yo, get the ear clap!
[03:47.30]What is this?
[03:47.84]Oh, you wanna get a double tap?
[03:48.98]What about you?
[03:49.70]Oh, what's this?
[03:50.38]Ooh!
[03:51.28]Ooh!
[03:51.88]What's that?
[03:52.46]Chin punch!
[03:53.36]Bitch!
[03:57.28]What you working on?
[03:59.74]Ah, sanding.
[04:01.36]I used to sand.
[04:03.00]It was a really tough job, really good, honest day's work.
[04:05.88]Go fuck yourself.
[04:14.28]Be careful, this is a pretty- be- this is- this ledge... I know you just wanna dance, that's great.
[04:19.14]But, you know, that's not a safe place to be- I told you, now you- now you're all wet!
[04:24.22]And that wasn't my fault, that was your fault.
[04:26.96]And now everyone- everyone's- everyone's going for a swim!
[04:29.84]Let's go!
[04:30.65]Everyone's going for a swim, get in!
[04:33.78]Do they actually follow you in?
[04:37.02]This one died!
[04:38.04]Oh, I gotta kill somebody.
[04:42.94]I almost just shit my pants when I did that, by the way.
[04:47.26]I seriously almost just shit my pants when I just sneezed.
[04:51.60]Did you hear?
[04:52.12]You know he shit his pants last night?
[04:53.80]Oh, what?
[04:54.22]He sneezed.
[04:54.92]That's gross.
[04:55.76]Take a look for yourself, man.
[04:56.87]Right here.
[04:57.33]Five minutes, 45 seconds.
[04:58.85]Bang.
[04:59.21]Shits his pants right there.
[05:00.13]How do you pull that off?
[05:00.95]I don't know, but it's disgusting.
[05:02.15]He seriously disgusts me on another level that I can't even explain.
[05:05.36]Mm-hmm, yeah.
[05:06.16]I mean, I shit my pants at least once a week, but I never play in Assassin's Creed.
[05:11.76]So I got MLC_St3alth in the call here now.
[05:13.88]We're gonna go over some tips and some secret strategies that he knows about the Assassin's Creed multiplayer, because I know nothing.
[05:20.32]All I know is that I'm the Joker.
[05:22.60]I'm playing as the Joker right now, and I need some secret tips from MLC_St3alth.
[05:27.74]Which does the Joker look like?
[05:28.90]Does he have a nose on his face?
[05:30.30]No, the Jo- We're all the Joker.
[05:33.66]Every single person on our team is the Joker.
[05:36.73]Do they have-
[05:38.94]You can tell who a player is if they're jumping on roofs.
[05:41.40]That's normally what they do.
[05:42.46]If they're moving quickly, it's a player.
[05:45.21]And you just gotta... You gotta sit there and hope they don't find you.
[05:48.53]You can't move.
[05:49.19]You can't budge.
[05:49.79]I don't know what this guy's doing.
[05:52.69]Is that a bad guy?
[05:53.77]No!
[05:54.33]Jesus!
[05:54.75]You just have to remain still.
[05:56.93]How did he...
[05:59.18]Hiding in a bush.
[06:00.68]That's the way you do it.
[06:01.56]You hide in the bush.
[06:02.54]Okay.
[06:03.50]Do I arrest this guy?
[06:04.36]Do I jump out and attack this guy?
[06:05.44]Stealth, what do I do?
[06:06.69]He's coming over here.
[06:07.27]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[06:07.99]Oh my god!
[06:09.49]I think I killed him.
[06:11.57]You have stunned him.
[06:12.13]No, I ripped him out.
[06:12.73]Stealth, how do I... Do I arrest him?
[06:14.11]Do I kill him?
[06:14.69]I'm like killing civilians right now, Stealth.
[06:16.41]What do I do?
[06:17.52]Stealth!
[06:19.00]Oh, am I still on the Skype call?
[06:27.43]You killed my brother!
[06:31.01]We got a huge amount of waves coming.
[06:33.81]Brace yourselves, crew!
[06:37.12]Oh!
[06:38.44]We're gonna crash directly into these people.
[06:41.92]The boat's gonna tip over.
[06:45.04]Holy crap.
[06:47.44]This one fateful day reminds me of a story.
[06:53.10]Did I ever tell you the story?
[06:56.25]about me old boards.
