[00:32.17]I don't have any V-Bucks.
[00:33.63]Get some V-Bucks or Robux.
[00:36.01]Why would I give Roblox money?
[00:39.01]Because they can enslave our youth.
[00:42.20]True.
[00:45.26]Give me one second.
[00:46.44]I've got a whole fucking thing behind me.
[00:48.90]Hold on.
[00:50.12]Give me like two minutes.
[00:53.98]Hi, everybody.
[00:55.98]Welcome to the stream.
[00:59.25]It's a very special stream today.
[01:02.59]Because today, today is somebody's birthday.
[01:09.95]I don't know whose birthday it is, but it's probably yours.
[01:13.29]I made a promise a week ago.
[01:21.91]And we're going to do it.
[01:26.01]So we got a couple people here.
[01:28.91]We got Oak and Stirr.
[01:33.44]Poke is going to guide Ster and I through the world of Roblox, because that's exactly what we're playing.
[01:40.67]So I'm just going to show this because this is kind of a pain in the ass to set up, but whatever.
[01:44.43]Oh, let me ask this question.
[01:51.07]Hey, before I like show everybody the screen, does it matter if they can see my username?
[02:02.71]I mean, they're going to see it anyways, right?
[02:09.54]Yeah, it does.
[02:10.04]I've seen a lot of nos and yeses.
[02:13.82]I was muted.
[02:14.68]Oops.
[02:15.62]You want to go to your profile and go to security or privacy and make it so only friends can join you.
[02:22.72]Okay, cool.
[02:23.36]Yeah, I think I already have that set up.
[02:24.61]Alright, cool.
[02:26.73]Cool, cool.
[02:27.29]Alright, I'm going to show this because people are waiting for it.
[02:35.29]Uh, happy birthday.
[02:38.09]Happy birthday!
[02:39.45]Happy Roblox birthday to whoever that was a week ago.
[02:42.76]I actually don't remember who it is.
[02:48.78]Are you kidding me?
[02:51.66]Yeah, Poke, it's somebody's birthday.
[02:53.20]That's the reason why I'm playing Roblox today.
[02:55.10]Well, happy birthday, somebody.
[02:56.10]Yeah, happy birthday.
[03:00.01]Is it a real person?
[03:03.25]I think so, yeah.
[03:05.87]I actually think it's somebody's birthday.
[03:07.17]Who is it?
[03:07.51]Uh, it's my birthday.
[03:11.46]Is it really?
[03:11.88]Happy birthday, dude.

[03:14.52]Like, I've been wanting to play Roblox.
[03:16.10]Tell me I haven't been hitting you up daily to play Roblox.
[03:19.60]Yeah.

[03:34.55]Oops.
[03:35.79]Hold on, I'll fix it.
[03:41.37]No, there isn't.

[04:27.48]We can jump into random stuff.
[04:28.94]I want to do Survive Michael Jackson in the kids game.
[04:31.92]Why don't we just do that right now?
[04:33.43]First thing.
[04:34.19]I don't want to play Survive Michael Jackson.
[04:39.45]Why not?
[04:41.43]It's my birthday and I don't even get to pick the game.
[04:45.33]Alright.
[04:46.14]Do we have to make a party or do we just all join that one?

[05:51.69]It might be loud.
[05:52.19]Okay, hold on.
[05:54.77]Oh my god, dude.

[06:10.66]Oh wait, there's in-game voice.
[06:12.99]Oh, you have to put your ID for that.
[06:16.07]So if you're not verified, you won't hear voice.
[06:18.63]Okay, I thought I heard something.
[06:19.95]I got spooked.
[06:22.31]Rocket launcher.

[06:56.26]What?
[06:56.66]Wipe him.
[06:58.48]Wait, he's right here.
[06:59.54]He's... Ow!
[07:01.10]My ears!
[07:03.12]Oh, he just ran away from you.
[07:07.41]I think I'm dead.
[07:08.11]I just saw you die.
[07:11.17]What?
[07:11.57]Okay, this is very strange.
[07:14.59]I'm going to turn the audio down just a little.
[07:17.03]I can't hear anything.
[07:18.53]You can't hear that?
[07:20.03]I can't hear...
[07:22.45]Anything Let me turn this down hold on Should I turn what like the hot like chat off to or do you keep that on poke?
[07:40.18]Uh, I usually hide it or you put your camel Alright, where's the audio there?
[07:46.85]Why would they do that?
[07:48.35]Why would they have that be the thing that plays when you go down on the volume?
[07:53.18]Why would they do that?
[07:55.06]I don't even hear anything when I go down.
[07:56.88]Like, it's using the wrong... What was it?
[07:58.36]Was it like the... It was an extremely loud sound effect when I pressed the down button on the volume.
[08:04.03]That's not even fucking cool.
[08:06.45]What?
[08:12.33]Jesus.
[08:15.31]Okay.
[08:16.62]Are we, is there, are we alright?
[08:19.04]Yeah.
[08:19.92]I'm turning this shit all the way fucking down.
[08:21.60]Alright, let's go.
[08:25.75]I'm so sorry about that.
[08:26.95]Alright.
[08:27.55]No, I gotta turn that off too.
[08:28.45]Do you guys have, are you guys, uh, how are you guys enjoying, uh, survive, um, oh my god.
[08:34.90]I'm trying to get my, my sound to even work at all.
[08:39.36]You guys wanna try a different map?
[08:41.99]Um, yeah, I'm just doing my settings.
[08:43.34]Hold on.
[08:43.68]We're just getting through this.
[08:45.00]I can use a private map, I think.
[08:46.78]What's the, um, how do I make it so people can't talk in the chat room?
[08:50.08]Do I do that in, like, my profile?
[08:52.98]Uh, I don't even know how to turn it off.
[08:53.98]I think... Alright, I'll try it one more time.
[09:06.87]What just happened?
[09:10.11]Why are there two different Michael Jacksons chasing this one person?
[09:15.18]Oh, no, they're chasing me.
[09:15.94]I just, like, aggroed.
[09:18.34]They cloned him.
[09:20.18]In Area 51.
[09:27.22]How do you sprint?
[09:29.90]Is there no sprint?
[09:33.73]Oh, you can press the chat button and hide it.
[09:37.45]Top left.
[09:40.13]What is going on?
[09:40.97]Okay.
[09:42.25]I wish I, I wish I was a map that I could see where you guys were.
[09:45.06]Okay.
[09:49.48]I think I, I think I got it.
[09:51.84]The first sound I heard was so I thought that was, I thought that was one of you guys doing that in the call.
[10:02.53]I think, I think we're doing pretty good.
[10:07.17]How do you win surviving Michael Jackson?
[10:10.95]There might not be a win condition here.
[10:13.71]I feel like he just gets everyone eventually.
[10:19.36]That was a good warm-up.
[10:20.94]Let's jump to one of the maps you wanted.
[10:22.66]I'm getting us a nice obstacle course map.
[10:31.93]Why did we let Ster pick the first game?
[10:34.19]What were we thinking?
[10:35.73]I feel like it's a prerequisite to be able to play anything else.
[10:41.21]You need to be able to survive Michael Jackson, then you're free to go around the play lane.
[10:46.01]Ster, do I have you?
[10:48.37]I don't know.
[10:49.15]I added you.
[10:50.03]I don't know what I'm doing.
[10:51.75]Oh, I got you.
[10:52.95]Okay, go to your friends list and join off me.
[10:55.05]Alright, so what's the easiest way to get out of this without closing the whole application?
[11:00.44]You could just close it.
[11:01.16]Oh, okay.
[11:01.94]If you have the website open, right?
[11:03.72]Yeah, I should.
[11:04.12]Like, the app is what is being captured, right?
[11:06.26]So is it going to kick me out of the app?
[11:09.54]Oh, no.
[11:09.78]You exit the experience and it's got me back on the, like, I don't know.
[11:13.35]You're on the website?
[11:14.21]I got the desktop mode.
[11:16.75]Well, I'll use the website and then click play on the website.
[11:18.75]Oh, back home.
[11:19.33]I see, back home.
[11:19.97]Okay, so I'm going to hide my screen so we can make sure we get in somewhere before everybody else does.
[11:26.56]So we'll see.
[11:28.70]Are you in a game right now, Poke?
[11:30.77]Yeah.
[11:34.46]Can I just join off you somehow?
[11:36.46]Yeah, it should be on friends.
[11:38.64]See me?
[11:40.02]I see you on friends.
[11:40.92]I could go to view profile.
[11:43.42]Yeah.
[11:43.94]Is there join?
[11:45.60]On your profile, I can unfriend you.
[11:50.37]Don't want to do that.
[11:50.95]Hold on.
[11:53.69]Let me see.
[11:57.23]See all.
[11:58.25]Oh, friend activity.
[11:59.13]Here it is.
[11:59.57]Okay, I see.
[12:00.71]Is it this one?
[12:01.33]Yeah, that's the one you're in.
[12:02.51]Alright, I'm going in.
[12:04.59]Oh, I see you.
[12:05.25]I don't see that you're in one.
[12:07.53]Really?
[12:08.38]Yeah, I don't see either of you are in a game.
[12:11.64]Refresh it.
[12:13.10]You gotta refresh it.
[12:15.50]Well, I saw yours before I saw him.
[12:16.94]You don't know what you're talking about.
[12:18.30]What do you mean?
[12:19.54]You're an amateur at this.
[12:20.62]What are we doing?
[12:21.12]This is the first time you and I have ever opened this whole game.
[12:24.30]We're doing this obstacle course.
[12:26.63]Okay.
[12:27.71]Stage 1 out of 50.
[12:28.74]This is the popular one right now amongst children.
[12:35.62]Okay, so are we just going for it?
[12:38.16]I'm waiting for Ster.
[12:40.28]Is he here?
[12:41.49]Every time I move my mouse, I'm here.
[12:44.49]Turn your sensitivity way down.
[12:47.83]Okay, you're fire guy, right?
[12:49.55]You're the phantom fireman.
[12:51.13]I'm fire guy.
[12:51.63]Your hitbox is way too big.
[12:53.09]I'm default guy.
[12:54.54]Okay, yep, I see you right here.
[12:56.52]And then there's... I'm the weird robot.
[12:58.39]With a chain.
[13:00.25]Alright, are we going?
[13:01.15]Yeah.
[13:02.59]Okay, here we go.
[13:03.25]Alright, let's go, let's race!
[13:06.35]Whee!
[13:06.73]Oh, there's a jump.
[13:08.79]Ooh, okay, cool.
[13:12.70]Is there any sound on this map?
[13:14.42]Yeah, I don't know why it's so quiet.
[13:15.72]I feel a little bit nervous.
[13:16.64]It's just like footprints.
[13:19.06]I don't even hear footprints.
[13:20.56]Usually there's, like, fun music.
[13:22.40]Okay, be careful when you- I'm holding right click and that's kind of probably a bad idea, right?
[13:26.31]Because when I turn the camera... You can- I think you press shift once.
[13:31.73]And it goes, like, into a different lock.
[13:34.13]Oh, alright.
[13:34.93]Shift.
[13:40.82]Not bad.
[13:41.08]Why is there no music?
[13:41.96]It's- Oh, you can climb too?
[13:44.52]Cool.
[13:47.12]Oh, shit.
[13:47.64]Alright, be careful.
[13:52.07]I think we're doing pretty good.
[14:01.77]Yeah.
[14:02.21]Dude, you're a 37-year-old man.
[14:05.61]Yeah, what of it?
[14:06.29]Do you have any idea what fucking today is?
[14:11.20]Honestly, if the kids are into it, you need to stop being such a boomer and acclimate.
[14:15.66]Like, if you don't get it, that's on you.
[14:18.02]It's gonna take like two or three hours.
[14:18.98]Everyone else gets it.
[14:19.80]It's gonna take me all day to clean up.
[14:22.45]I think you guys are like an hour ahead of me.
[14:25.17]Did you fall down?
[14:26.61]On stage seven.
[14:27.73]You can pay money to skip the stage.
[14:31.01]You can pay money?
[14:32.09]Yeah.
[14:33.57]Wait, why is this?
[14:35.44]How come the floor is gone?
[14:40.60]Yeah, I'm just going to pay the money.
[14:42.14]I'll see you guys at the end.
[14:43.18]What is happening?
[14:45.42]How much is it to skip?
[14:49.98]Wait, there's like weapons.
[14:53.43]I'm going to delete this.
[14:58.67]You have to buy them.
[15:01.81]What?
[15:02.89]You stand over it and it's like, hey, use your Robux to get the gravity coil.
[15:06.88]How much is this?
[15:11.22]800 Robux?
[15:16.80]That's how they get you.
[15:17.90]It's 50% off, dude.
[15:20.54]Are you going to pass up that deal?
[15:23.48]What the fuck is going on?
[15:29.18]Why can I not do this one?
[15:30.49]Alright, no.
[15:33.05]Wait, go, go, go, go, go.
[15:33.79]Alright, I made it.
[15:37.43]Is there really no music for you?
[15:38.55]Like, there's no music, right?
[15:39.61]No.
[15:39.77]I'm playing my own.
[15:40.96]Okay, no.
[15:41.48]There's only, like, there's only sound effects.
[15:45.41]it's so quiet how does it even happen it defaulted audio for me to my VR headset that's not plugged in so I think it might have done that again I'm so glad I turned it down oh I need the magic carpet wait you're gonna spend money on the magic carpet but not on like a cool outfit no I'm not I'm afraid to play robloxer whenever you guys are ready for the next map I got one
[16:15.55]I want to see how far I can get with this.
[16:18.31]Cool.
[16:19.83]Cool.
[16:21.91]Yeah, I saw you playing a game like this earlier today, Poke, so you're all practice.
[16:26.07]Is this person hacking, Poke?
[16:27.23]This person's like flying around.
[16:28.19]No, he probably paid money.
[16:31.85]Okay.
[16:36.45]This stage was hard.
[16:42.59]So, but, alright, I have a question.
[16:44.46]If you bought the magic carpet to fly around, what's the point of the whole game?
[16:48.86]Isn't the whole point, like, to jump around and jump on the platform so you just, like, fly to the end?
[16:53.50]Yeah, but instant gratification.
[16:56.78]You can just, you can just do it.
[16:58.32]What did they offer?
[17:00.16]The person just took my fucking hair.
[17:02.90]What just happened?
[17:07.53]Oh, wait.
[17:09.13]Alright, I got it, I got it.
[17:12.80]I don't know what's happening at any moment.
[17:16.72]I see you over there, Poke.
[17:18.42]I see you going pretty far.
[17:19.44]It defaulted Roblox to my headset, my VR again.
[17:30.59]Don't people make some wild, wild shit in this game?
[17:35.36]Yeah.
[17:35.96]There are whole Call of Duty games, right?
[17:38.78]Oh yeah, I'll show you that one.
[17:40.02]It's pretty crazy.
[17:43.24]Look at that.
[17:43.76]I made some progress.
[17:46.34]Oh, dude.
[17:47.50]Where are you, sir?
[17:49.45]I'm on stage 18 out of 50.
[17:51.15]You're a little bit ahead of me.
[17:52.33]I am, yeah.
[17:52.97]This person's like, what is this person doing?
[17:55.69]Get this person out of here.
[17:56.83]Get away from me.
[17:57.69]What the fuck is this person doing?
[17:59.76]Get the fuck away from me.
[18:01.70]Get out of here.
[18:02.36]I have to win.
[18:02.96]Hold on.
[18:03.28]Wow.
[18:08.60]As someone who didn't get into the Fall Guys craze, this is probably the best version of jumping around on colorful blocks that exists.
[18:16.65]Actually, this is kind of fun.
[18:19.83]That kills you.
[18:20.51]That was pretty sick.
[18:24.73]Missing music.
[18:30.21]He loves Roblox.
[18:32.53]Honestly, this might be my new main game.
[18:36.27]Roblox is great.
[18:37.01]I think it's... I'm just going to say it.
[18:40.17]What?
[18:40.53]I think it's better than Minecraft.
[18:43.17]Ooh.
[18:43.97]Yeah, I said it.
[18:44.47]People are going to hate me for that one.
[18:47.84]Oh, you've been doing Minecraft speedruns, haven't you?
[18:51.80]Yeah.
[18:55.58]It's fun.
[18:57.26]Why is there an ad right here for this?
[18:59.02]Wait, there's an ad?
[19:01.41]When you see it, you'll laugh.
[19:06.83]I'm like having a good time right now.
[19:09.35]I'm actually enjoying this.
[19:12.99]That makes sense to me.
[19:14.09]This is the pace of game you typically enjoy.
[19:17.51]Wait, the ad disappeared.
[19:18.45]Get out of here.
[19:24.53]I didn't see the ad.
[19:28.29]Wait, I saw an ad.
[19:28.97]You didn't see it.
[19:29.57]What the heck?
[19:31.55]Did you beat the last boss in Sekiro?
[19:33.91]Why'd I fall?
[19:35.89]You know that I didn't.
[19:44.31]Baby sensory stream.
[19:47.41]Okay, cool.
[19:48.27]Yeah, I don't see an ad or anything.
[19:49.97]You got like an actual ad.
[19:51.05]Yeah, I saw a random little ad on the side for the new Mario movie.
[19:56.12]What?
[19:56.38]It's so random.
[20:05.92]They're distracting me.
[20:13.49]Alright, I'm at 29.
[20:14.45]I'm at 30.
[20:16.75]I'm at 34.
[20:17.11]I'm popping off right now.
[20:25.63]Okay.
[20:26.32]Not bad.
[20:31.02]Dude, are you zonked right now?
[20:35.54]What does that mean?
[20:36.88]People think I like smoked weed before I did this.
[20:40.60]No, it's a birthday party.
[20:43.38]That big cookie over there is going to be shared by all of us.
[20:47.64]Is that why I'm invited?
[20:48.44]I don't do this.
[20:52.77]Of course not.
[20:59.09]33.
[20:59.11]Where are you, sir?
[20:59.97]Sir, I'm going to wait for you.
[21:03.01]I'm having a grand old time.
[21:05.63]Is that you all the way over there?
[21:07.35]I got wings.
[21:10.19]You can fly with the wings.
[21:11.83]Are you the elephant?
[21:13.04]No.
[21:14.34]I have the golden wings.
[21:15.82]I'm on 38 out of 50.
[21:18.70]Oh, it's way better in first person.
[21:19.88]Wait, that's you right there?
[21:20.54]You have these cool ass wings?
[21:22.16]Yeah.
[21:23.40]Is it cheating to go first person?
[21:31.95]It's cheating to do first person.
[21:33.49]Oh, whatever.
[21:34.45]Yeah, it's cheating.
[21:35.31]I heard that you get banned if you do it.
[21:40.23]Are you supposed to know which color kills you?
[21:43.11]No, you just pay money probably.
[21:45.63]Oh, wait.
[21:45.93]Are you at the thing where it's blue and red?
[21:49.04]Yeah.
[21:50.06]It's very confusing.
[21:50.82]When you touch the red, you die.
[21:53.74]No, but on some of them, it's the opposite.
[21:56.24]Yeah, it's a hard game and you get good at playing it.
[22:03.71]You're the last person I would expect to complain about a game being a little difficult.
[22:10.39]Well, I should be higher up on your list because apparently I hate literally every game.
[22:21.38]What?
[22:22.48]Also... You know what?
[22:25.82]No, I'll give it to you.
[22:26.52]This is insane.
[22:27.38]This is really hard.
[22:28.33]I think anyone who can complete this stage without the magic carpet...
[22:34.04]Poke, you're almost done, aren't you?
[22:36.90]I'm at 44.
[22:37.10]Yeah, I'm at 41.
[22:39.02]Wait, when did I get ahead of you?
[22:41.32]What?
[22:43.19]I'm on 44.
[22:43.93]I'm right behind Poke.
[22:45.01]What?
[22:46.11]You're getting clowned on right now.
[22:52.75]I'm speedrunning.
[22:56.13]I'm going to catch you.
[22:58.41]But there's no way, because there's not even any turns.
[23:02.69]Yeah, but what if one of you falls off?
[23:07.29]That could happen.
[23:07.93]How are you supposed to know which one of those is going to fall?
[23:15.67]Hey, it's a hard game, man.
[23:20.04]You got to buy the glasses on the left side.
[23:24.54]I got it.
[23:25.70]How many dollars like what's the dollar to Roblox Roblox blocks?
[23:31.80]Uh, I can answer that pretty quickly.
[23:33.24]It was $20 for, I believe, $1,700 or $1,800?
[23:37.32]Roll up dollars, whatever it is.
[23:41.61]That's what I bought.
[23:46.25]I'm done.
[23:46.55]I made it to $50.
[23:47.75]Where are my big hands?
[23:48.75]How come they got taken away?
[23:50.71]Look at him not making it here.
[23:52.57]That's kind of embarrassing.
[23:54.82]Oh.
[23:55.80]I'm getting there.
[23:56.60]I'm at $47.
[24:01.03]Oh, my God.
[24:01.49]This is a cute Roblox girl.
[24:06.35]That's the default girl.
[24:08.57]Oh, dude.
[24:10.31]Oh, dude.
[24:11.69]Somebody said you bought it?
[24:14.17]I don't think you don't buy Roblox.
[24:15.63]You just play it.
[24:16.28]Hey, hacker guy.
[24:16.96]Come on.
[24:17.28]Stop.
[24:19.54]Hey, hacker guy.
[24:20.58]Alright.
[24:26.02]This is it.
[24:26.40]This is the last part.
[24:30.07]We're all waiting for you.
[24:40.55]Wait, you only get three minutes left to do this?
[24:46.19]Yeah, I think you're the last person.
[24:49.75]I was the last person to finish it.
[24:51.03]Yeah, it started the timer.
[24:53.03]I would do my animation that I bought.
[24:54.39]It was like $5.
[25:03.21]Okay.
[25:03.33]Alright.
[25:05.33]That was fun.
[25:06.29]Let's keep it rolling.
[25:08.39]I put a link.
[25:11.74]Oh, that one looks actually really cool.
[25:13.90]This one.
[25:15.08]I love this one.
[25:22.22]Really cool.
[25:25.25]What you act like that?
[25:26.19]Oh, what am I ironic?
[25:27.19]I can't say that looks cool.
[25:29.76]It was like the Jerma hashtag ad stream voice.
[25:33.34]Shut up.
[25:33.74]Really cool.
[25:34.46]Shut up.
[25:35.22]This looks sick.
[25:36.70]I fucking hate your guts.
[25:46.16]We're both here.
[25:46.66]Did we both beat you again?
[25:47.89]Yeah, I'm trying to turn my chat off.
[25:55.01]I'm coming in.
[25:59.87]Alright, so.
[26:00.47]Ow.
[26:00.55]Did we get to ride it together?
[26:03.20]Yeah.
[26:06.52]No, you guys are riding it without me.
[26:07.68]No, we're waiting for you.
[26:09.40]We're just waiting for you.
[26:11.06]Where are you?
[26:11.50]He's just standing on top of us.
[26:13.91]Wait, where are you?
[26:15.09]Wait, where are you?
[26:19.05]What?
[26:19.23]Oh, he joined his own server.
[26:22.45]What?
[26:24.41]Oh, hold on.
[26:25.60]I'll fix it.
[26:29.76]Am I in there now?
[26:40.94]I'm joining off of you.
[26:42.88]This is friend activity, and then it just puts me in my own game.
[26:45.76]Oh, because the server's private.
[26:47.84]Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[26:49.74]Sorry.
[26:50.28]My bad.
[26:53.85]Mm-hmm.
[27:01.58]Alright, coming in.
[27:13.78]Alright, sorry about that.
[27:15.06]It takes me a little extra time.
[27:16.20]Alright, so let's do it.
[27:19.22]Alright, you spawn a cart and you just see how far you can go.
[27:22.44]Okay, so if you want to officially race cart game pass here.
[27:29.17]No, no, no.
[27:29.91]Buy a dangerous bomb.
[27:30.91]I don't want to do that.
[27:35.80]Right here.
[27:36.14]Okay.

[29:05.60]I was pressing W and it was doing nothing.
[29:06.98]Alright, I got it.
[29:07.58]I got it.
[29:07.80]If you go too fast, we might fall.
[29:11.30]Don't go too fast?
[29:12.66]Yeah, we might fall.
[29:13.76]Dude.
[29:16.80]Well, I didn't know.
[29:17.68]I thought we were just... I thought it was like a fucking Disney ride.
[29:19.98]I didn't know we had to control it.
[29:23.95]This one's out of order.
[29:24.89]Please.
[29:27.36]Maybe I shouldn't control it.
[29:28.68]Maybe somebody with some skills.
[29:30.18]How did you control it?
[29:31.52]How did you drive?
[29:32.26]Just W. I had to turn it on twice.
[29:34.36]In the back.
[29:36.46]I love your character.
[29:38.20]Thank you.
[29:38.81]I don't even get a fair try.
[29:41.93]Why are there police coming?
[29:46.25]Oh, we're good.
[29:55.27]How do you do one turn?
[29:58.85]I can't.
[29:59.33]I'm stuck.
[30:01.63]I don't know.
[30:05.95]Ah, shit.
[30:06.39]Now we gotta wait for the maintenance guy to show up and fix this ride.
[30:10.44]I paid money so I could fly in this.
[30:12.76]Like, I'll fix it.
[30:14.26]Alright, we're good though.
[30:18.89]We got to get through this at least once.
[30:20.41]We got to get through one time.
[30:21.53]Alright, here you go.
[30:23.59]Who's driving it?
[30:25.29]I will try it one more time.
[30:26.75]I'm down the track already.
[30:29.12]Alright, turning it on.
[30:29.66]We'll pick you up.
[30:30.68]You got to go real slow, man.
[30:34.06]You can go slow on the turn.
[30:35.50]Slow on the turn.
[30:36.76]What is brake?
[30:37.34]Just S?
[30:38.22]S. Okay.
[30:44.41]You got this.
[30:48.03]Alright, let's go.
[30:48.79]Alright, get in.
[30:53.89]Careful, you could push us.
[30:56.06]There you go.
[30:56.38]I'm in.
[30:56.76]Let's go.
[30:58.42]Oh, what?
[30:59.16]This is looking hard.
[31:00.14]This is going to be impossible.
[31:01.34]Are you kidding me?
[31:02.12]Just go real close.
[31:04.30]Take it easy.
[31:05.98]Just sit back.
[31:08.37]Relax.
[31:10.11]Buy some more V-Bucks.
[31:13.00]Wait, why is there something in front?
[31:13.88]Look at this!
[31:15.94]What?
[31:16.12]What is that?
[31:17.65]He's pushing me.
[31:19.35]Why is there a car?
[31:22.69]That was weird.
[31:23.25]Yeah, it was weird.
[31:33.50]How come it says I'm suffering underneath my name?
[31:36.98]I was wondering that earlier.
[31:40.54]I'm starting to suffer.
[31:42.14]What does suffering mean?
[31:44.94]When you're starting to suffer, suffered and suffering.
[31:48.22]Yeah.
[31:49.82]I'm definitely starting to suffer.
[31:52.40]That was tight.
[32:05.15]I keep thinking that I'm hitting something when you do that.
[32:07.75]Why is there a gun?
[32:08.85]Oh, whoops.
[32:09.45]Uh-oh.
[32:11.72]Oh, come on.
[32:13.60]I got it.
[32:15.32]When you press A or D, you shoot a little cannon.
[32:30.09]Alright, this is straight coming up here.
[32:31.35]Whoa!
[32:34.63]What just happened?
[32:37.07]You didn't see little bumps?
[32:38.33]What?
[32:40.65]I didn't know there was going to be little bumps.
[32:42.07]Hold on, can we fix it?
[32:44.59]I pressed space again.
[32:45.92]Maybe I can.
[32:46.98]Poke, can you fix it?
[32:53.62]What?
[32:57.50]Maybe.
[32:58.23]Are you holding a cotton candy?
[33:00.83]What is in your hand?
[33:02.53]It's a flight potion.
[33:03.87]Oh, I thought you were just like enjoying the carnival eating a cotton candy.
[33:09.91]I can't fix this.
[33:13.89]Oh, there's a big loop-de-loop too.
[33:16.14]How do we ride the loop-de-loop?
[33:19.04]I want to ride the loop-de-loop.
[33:21.34]There's no way.
[33:23.04]We can't go in like a slight curve.
[33:26.09]Let me see if I can see where you guys are.
[33:39.45]I also paid for this right here, the fast car.
[33:41.45]See, he's got cotton candy.
[33:45.53]Oh, wait, wait.
[33:46.30]Okay, cool, cool, cool.
[33:47.58]They took it away from me.
[33:49.62]They took it away?
[33:50.48]What?
[33:52.02]I'm on my DLC right now.
[33:53.66]My season pass.
[33:55.65]That's unfortunate.
[33:57.17]Extra large carts?
[34:02.69]Oh, for all the boys.
[34:04.15]Alright, Poke.
[34:05.39]You should drive.
[34:06.66]I'll be in the back again.
[34:07.38]Oh, Ster, you want to go?
[34:08.46]Alright, Ster, drive.
[34:09.78]I'm going.
[34:10.18]I think it turns now.
[34:14.30]It's still somehow way too loud, even at like zero sound.
[34:18.20]I can't go.
[34:21.31]It's W. I'm holding W and it's screeching at me.
[34:26.28]Oh, because it's not on.
[34:28.06]Oh, now it is.
[34:31.34]Get in the seat.
[34:33.42]I can't fit in.
[34:34.14]Alright, there we go.
[34:37.23]Like, dude, there are four empty seats.
[34:39.25]Why do I have to sit in the one right behind you?
[34:40.93]Like, I don't.
[34:43.11]Follow the back here.
[34:49.84]Whoa.
[34:51.48]Whoa.
[34:51.70]Alright.
[34:52.16]Can you make it?
[34:52.60]We got a big turn coming up.
[34:57.27]Whoa.
[34:59.59]Ster, you got to get us to the loop to loop.
[35:02.95]I don't even know if this connects to that.
[35:04.99]One of those cars just crashed.
[35:15.58]Scary tunnel?
[35:17.54]How do we get to the scary tunnel entrance?
[35:18.90]That sounds fun.
[35:20.04]Pass a loop-de-loop.
[35:22.06]Ster, you got to use all of your gamer skills here and do this.
[35:25.74]We have to go in this... What?
[35:30.01]What happened to you?
[35:30.77]I didn't do anything.
[35:36.29]Well, that one's over.
[35:38.39]We're still attached or something.
[35:46.97]Okay.
[35:50.83]No.
[35:51.17]Alright.
[35:53.67]Here, I got us the fast car.
[35:55.49]Ooh, fast car.
[35:57.25]Let's go.
[35:57.97]Can you drive it?
[36:01.99]How much money do you have?
[36:05.60]I got some Robux.
[36:06.48]Are you a Roblox millionaire?
[36:10.35]Maybe.
[36:10.69]I think it's asking me to buy it to even sit in it.
[36:13.25]Yeah.
[36:13.87]Wait, to sit in it?
[36:15.01]Yeah.
[36:15.17]Oh, no, no.
[36:15.57]I... Oh.
[36:16.73]Wait.
[36:17.19]I can... I have... I got money.
[36:19.75]You want to buy it?
[36:20.47]I got 259 Roblox after this.
[36:23.61]If I press this button, is it going to, like... What just happened?
[36:27.14]I reset it for us.
[36:28.04]Does it just give me access to it, or is it going to, like, open up, like, credit card information when I press this button?
[36:32.50]No, it won't.
[36:33.04]It won't.
[36:33.34]It'll be fine.
[36:36.14]Go.
[36:36.24]Alright.
[36:39.55]So I have access to it now.
[36:40.84]Ster, do you have 60 Roblox cents?
[36:43.04]Yeah, for anyone who has kids and you're wondering like how your kid spent like a thousand dollars in Roblox, this is how.
[36:51.26]No, there's way worse ones.
[36:53.10]This is... Alright, it's your car, Ster.
[36:57.91]Okay.
[37:02.91]We gotta get our... Should I... I'm kind of scared to drive this.
[37:08.74]Oh no, there's no room for you.
[37:11.84]I'll be behind you guys.
[37:16.22]Be careful.
[37:16.80]We gotta get to the loop-de-loop.
[37:21.49]We're dead.
[37:24.39]Woah.
[37:28.93]Brakes are pretty good.
[37:29.97]Brakes are clean.
[37:32.01]This fucking Jojo character driving the car.
[37:34.52]Very important wall.
[37:35.36]Please don't shoot.
[37:36.10]I beg you.
[37:36.50]This is so important.
[37:37.16]You won't believe how important it is.
[37:39.58]Oh, it bounced off.
[37:42.56]Interesting.
[37:43.50]Okay.
[37:46.19]Excuse me.
[37:46.75]Hurry up, please.
[37:49.81]Yeah, we're riding way too slow.
[37:55.96]Watch that bump.
[37:58.04]You're the one driving.
[37:58.74]Watch it.
[38:01.67]Does this one handle better too?
[38:02.87]Feels like it does.
[38:03.85]Yeah, it just passed.
[38:11.95]Oh!
[38:16.08]Wow.
[38:18.02]How much did you pay for this?
[38:18.98]I don't know.
[38:20.54]40 cents?
[38:24.56]40 cents too much.
[38:26.68]The car is coming behind us.
[38:30.92]That default stock explosion sound is like my favorite part so far.
[38:36.76]Alright, Poke.
[38:38.00]It's time for you to get us to the loop-de-loop.
[38:40.12]This is not going to happen between me and Stirr.
[38:42.17]Okay.
[38:42.43]This is not going to happen.
[38:45.47]I know a way.
[38:47.47]You know a way?
[38:48.31]I know a way.
[38:48.85]Yeah, get on.
[38:51.53]Turn the engine on in the back.
[38:53.43]Did you just say fall damage?
[38:54.55]Alright.
[38:57.23]Alright, Stirr, you got to turn the engine on.
[38:58.57]I think I did.
[39:01.14]No, you're going to press E. I'm doing it!
[39:02.72]There we go.
[39:08.44]That works.
[39:09.66]Stuart, you're probably going to get really sick.
[39:12.82]I'm... I'm holding it together.
[39:17.84]You just... Okay, so we have to go here.
[39:19.86]Ooh.
[39:21.36]The dehumidifier.
[39:26.43]Remain seated.
[39:27.57]Why would you buy a dehumidifier?
[39:32.18]This is the suffering process to get the suffering hot.
[39:38.04]Have we been dehumidified yet?
[39:41.34]Is that going to explode in here?
[39:44.78]Uh oh.
[39:58.90]This would be the scariest fucking ride ever.
[40:01.86]This would be terrifying.
[40:05.00]No child should ride this.
[40:07.68]No human should ever ride this.
[40:08.66]This is scary.
[40:10.68]You are now less humid.
[40:16.47]Okay, we get up here.
[40:17.23]Alright.
[40:19.93]Here you go.
[40:20.35]Use this one here.
[40:21.55]Oh, my God.
[40:22.47]Oak, you're legendary.
[40:23.61]Legendary.
[40:24.43]Legendary gamer.
[40:25.81]I played too much of this for some reason.
[40:28.56]Alright.
[40:28.86]There you go.
[40:29.33]Now you guys have to loop.
[40:30.33]Now we can loop?
[40:32.11]Yeah.
[40:33.39]Good luck, gentlemen.
[40:34.29]Hold on to something, Ster.
[40:35.05]We're going to go fast.
[40:39.05]You got to put your hands up.
[40:40.50]I don't know how to do that.
[40:43.32]Hands up.
[40:44.46]Oh.
[40:46.66]Holy.
[40:47.20]Wait, why does it end like this?
[40:48.50]What?
[40:51.86]What?
[40:52.22]It just kills you?
[40:54.00]You're supposed to press the button right at the end.
[40:56.50]There's like a little button.
[41:00.48]Alright, let's ride it in first person.
[41:02.24]Let's ride this one more time in first person.
[41:03.64]Let's get like a big one so we can all do it.
[41:05.70]Okay, cool.
[41:11.85]Okay.
[41:13.79]I have definitely proposed games to you that you've played for less time than this.
[41:19.87]But let's go.
[41:20.73]You gotta turn it on.
[41:28.58]This is different, man.
[41:30.67]Alright, let's go.
[41:34.07]Make sure you press the button.
[41:36.93]It's after the loop.
[41:39.09]You stink.
[41:40.89]I just hold W. There's nothing else.
[41:44.90]You stink.
[41:50.90]I'll do it.
[41:56.13]I switched the thing, but we...
[42:02.94]No, it's alright.
[42:03.68]Oh, that was fun.
[42:06.60]Loved it.
[42:07.26]Go backwards if you got stuck.
[42:09.90]Oh.
[42:11.14]That was a perfect cut.
[42:15.80]That'd be great for TikTok.
[42:31.40]That's the Sopranos joke right there.
[42:33.80]Oh, man.
[42:37.02]That was cool.
[42:37.52]Alright.
[42:37.78]Let's do another one.
[42:39.31]Let's see what we got.
[42:40.59]You want to do a shooter one or a scary one?
[42:45.25]Either one of those sound awesome.
[42:46.87]Whatever one you think.
[42:47.47]Okay.
[42:50.83]Oh, wait.
[42:51.09]Let's do the shooter one with the cool graphics for a second.
[42:53.73]Oh, yeah.
[42:54.51]Hell yeah.
[42:59.86]This is a good map.
[43:00.52]I like this one.
[43:03.95]Alright.
[43:11.14]I think you just join me and then.
[43:17.44]From present.
[43:18.84]I join our friends.
[43:19.91]Yep.
[43:23.35]Alright, where are we going?
[43:24.23]Let's see.
[43:29.99]Oh, OK.
[43:33.50]Wait, this is in Roblox?
[43:36.96]Yeah.
[43:38.64]What?
[43:39.02]Uh-oh.
[43:39.62]Shit's about to get intense.
[43:44.82]I think.
[43:45.22]Okay, spawn.
[43:49.97]Loadout.
[43:55.87]How do you even make this in... How is this possible to make this in this game?
[44:00.43]This looks insane.
[44:04.16]It's kind of loud.
[44:06.96]What?
[44:08.14]I think I have to go into the actual source and lower the volume.
[44:10.62]It's so loud.
[44:11.16]Alright, that's a lot better.
[44:17.61]What?
[44:17.95]Isn't that crazy?
[44:20.67]Yeah, this is actually crazy.
[44:21.75]I'm in queue.
[44:22.35]I can't see it.
[44:22.97]Holy shit.
[44:26.99]The requested experience is full.
[44:29.38]That doesn't look like a Roblox guy.
[44:30.84]I'm joining.
[44:31.42]I'm joining.
[44:35.69]Oh, how is this possible?
[44:44.69]Oh, mean Ster in a game.
[44:45.65]I think I'm in the same game, right?
[44:47.93]I'm in a different game?
[44:49.69]Yeah.
[44:50.41]Fuck.
[44:55.14]Actually, no!
[45:00.30]It said friend activity and I joined friend activity.
[45:06.24]It might be hard to play together on this one.
[45:10.02]Oh, maybe because of the teams.
[45:12.04]Yeah.
[45:16.45]You're fresh at this game.
[45:18.19]Yeah, whatever.
[45:28.19]How do they have... Okay, I'm not impressed with the graphics.
[45:31.97]I'm impressed that they have a kill cam.
[45:33.89]How?
[45:36.14]My sensitivity is fucked.
[45:37.36]Hold on.
[45:45.12]I think the graphics are insane.
[45:46.54]Yeah, but how are you not impressed by the graphics?
[45:50.20]I'm just saying I'm more impressed that there's a kill cam.
[45:54.56]That's a lot more complicated than making things look pretty.
[45:59.58]I'm sure someone dedicated to the blocks.
[46:02.86]Put the blocks together.
[46:09.93]Turn up your graphics.
[46:12.07]I think there... There's not even a graphics slider or setting in the game, is there?
[46:18.59]That's what you think.
[46:19.25]Is this eSports?
[46:20.94]There are grenades.
[46:27.56]This is definitely eSports, right?
[46:32.89]Shit.
[46:34.85]I do so bad with hold instead of toggle.
[46:40.39]Okay, you two.
[46:42.71]Is aim down sights for you hard to do when it's hold or are you a toggle?
[46:51.72]It depends on the game, really.
[46:53.42]I think I'm a holder.
[46:56.20]I'm always toggle.
[46:57.76]Yeah, I'm a holder.
[47:01.54]I like toggle for some games.
[47:03.28]I'm going to try to get into your guys' game.
[47:04.74]Alright, friend activity.
[47:09.93]as you're in it.
[47:12.33]Yeah, I'm older lines.
[47:13.78]Just friends.
[47:14.38]Okay.
[47:14.66]I think it's because it's full.
[47:24.04]Oh, it's full.
[47:24.56]Your your game is full.
[47:25.73]Did you leave?
[47:26.35]I leave.
[47:29.23]I was never in your guys game.
[47:31.29]Oh,
[47:33.84]People are saying we should do a scary one called Doors, and it's like... Everyone's been telling me to do Doors.
[47:38.36]Yeah, it's like the best Roblox game, I think.
[47:41.64]In terms of, like... Where are the... Where's the, um... Like, how do I spend my Roblox in here to fly?
[47:53.01]Oh, yeah.
[47:53.89]Where's, like, the pay for the magic carpet?
[47:56.18]You can, like, customize your whole gun.
[47:59.98]Look at my sensitivity, guys.
[48:03.03]This is so fucked up.
[48:05.33]Everything feels so wrong.
[48:08.87]Yeah, Roblox has a lot of fun shooters.
[48:12.20]Really fun ones.
[48:14.38]Because it's really easy because you're just shooting kids on their iPads.
[48:19.28]This is unironically incredibly impressive.
[48:24.31]This is actually blowing my mind how actually cool this is.
[48:33.41]First kill ever.
[48:34.09]Got it.
[48:34.43]Finally.
[48:35.45]First kill ever.
[48:36.95]Mr. Jerma985, your game is running at automatic graphics.
[48:39.59]Your computer is probably not good enough.
[48:41.99]Wait, oh.
[48:45.68]Wait, is that zero?
[48:52.22]Oh, shit.
[48:52.64]This looks really good now.
[48:54.68]Yeah, Jerma, you can play this on your iPad, by the way.
[48:56.42]I don't know if you know that.
[49:02.73]Yeah, there's plenty of very fun games on the iPad.
[49:05.55]There's plenty of great experiences to enjoy on a mobile device.
[49:10.00]This is one of them.
[49:19.42]Yeah, we definitely should do some horror games too, because, you know, everybody loves those.
[49:23.39]Am I in a game alone right now?
[49:28.29]I think it's hard to get in a game together because... It's just because the game gets full.
[49:34.01]I want to play with my friends.
[49:37.51]Okay, I'm going to link... A shooting game where you just get a random gun all the time.
[49:46.08]Over the top.
[49:48.54]I didn't team kill, right?
[50:04.25]I feel like the people that I'm playing against are better than like top 500 Overwatch yeah that was really cool I enjoyed that we should play squid game people are saying should we play squid game I know you die if you do that
[50:33.43]Only one of us will get to live.
[50:36.03]I'm ready to hop in another one.
[50:39.01]You should be able to join me off friends list.
[50:41.49]People make this joke and I know you were making this joke earlier, but just being able to jump from experience to experience really is kind of that's my cup of tea.
[50:51.00]You just can just play what I just jump in it.
[50:53.10]Who cares?
[50:53.48]You play for five minutes, fucking leave, right?
[50:55.60]Like or an hour.
[50:56.64]Doesn't matter.
[50:57.52]Yep.
[50:58.32]That's your Steam library.
[51:00.24]Yeah.
[51:03.02]Alright.
[51:04.38]Should you get a private one or are we just joining off you?
[51:08.36]I just joined almost full lobby.
[51:10.22]Flame him in all caps in chat.
[51:13.32]What?
[51:14.38]I don't know.
[51:17.57]Dude, look at this.
[51:18.27]Are we in the same game, Poke?
[51:21.81]I don't think so.
[51:24.59]I'll try joining you.
[51:26.29]Kill them all.
[51:27.31]Make them suffer.
[51:29.69]This one's very different.
[51:31.69]Voting.
[51:33.05]Assault, Lodgeworks, or Mountain Village.
[51:40.55]Whatever you think is good.
[51:42.13]I don't know.
[51:43.72]Oh yeah, your server is really full.
[51:51.98]Yo, I'm ready to game.
[51:55.48]I'm ready to, I'm ready to game for like a solid three minutes and then we can just hop into a brand new experience.
[52:03.40]Let's deploy.
[52:05.42]Something about these characters, like, I don't know something about these characters holding like guns is my brain is having, hold on.
[52:20.70]Sensitivity.
[52:21.98]I'll never get it right.
[52:25.89]Every time we get in a game, I have to get it off my VR.
[52:31.39]What the fuck was that?
[52:32.25]Oh, this guy's headshotting every single person.
[52:37.87]Oh, is he cheating?
[52:38.82]I don't know.
[52:39.24]It's hard to tell.
[52:39.88]My sensitivity is insane.
[52:54.26]I know, I'm having trouble finding the right, uh, middle ground.
[52:58.56]I don't even know where you changed.
[52:59.44]Just go to the sense and type 0.3.
[53:08.69]This is fun too.
[53:11.53]Yeah, this one, this game is really fun.
[53:13.07]Arsenal.
[53:14.83]These games are just addicting, like just time waster.
[53:17.23]I actually really like them.
[53:20.52]Ooh, I got a new gun.
[53:25.00]Shit.
[53:25.12]It needs to be even lower.
[53:31.30]I feel like the sensitivity is changing from game to game, too.
[53:33.92]Yeah, that's how it is.
[53:40.85]We said they love Roblox.
[53:42.43]Oh, yeah.
[53:42.87]This is great.
[53:44.65]Dude, when are we going to fucking play...
[53:50.05]Ster is seething right now because like I'm having fun playing this like fucking goofy like Pick any game grab bag experience when he's like desperately tried to get me to play path of eggs off like five years I I just unmute it to my stream and was saying exactly that like 30 seconds before you started saying it What is this weapon?
[54:16.24]This thing is amazing, oh
[54:25.65]It's also like I'm max on volume and it's really quiet.
[54:31.91]I'm having the opposite problem.
[54:32.79]I don't know why that would be.
[54:37.39]Oh, how's he not dead?
[54:41.65]Whoa.
[54:47.48]There is a little quiet.
[54:48.52]I will turn you up then.
[54:53.00]How's that?
[54:53.70]How do I sound?
[54:54.66]Uh, probably better.
[54:57.87]Okay.
[54:58.23]WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?!
[55:00.03]WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!
[55:00.91]Oh, what the hell?
[55:01.83]What did hap- what- honestly, what just happened?
[55:03.95]Wait, what was that?
[55:05.27]What happened?!
[55:06.87]What hap- what did you- what happened?
[55:08.32]Was that in the game?
[55:08.96]Yeah, that was in the game.
[55:13.79]Join a new game.
[55:15.21]Did you do that, you piece of shit?
[55:17.47]Did you actually do that?
[55:19.33]Yes, you did.
[55:20.53]Yes, you did.
[55:21.91]No, I swear, if I knew how to do it, I would do it.
[55:24.95]You just did that.
[55:27.41]Wasn't me.
[55:28.51]Yes, it was.
[55:30.71]Why do you... I don't know.
[55:31.81]It's the dev.
[55:33.65]You did that somehow.
[55:35.53]Wait, am I actually blaming you for that?
[55:40.09]Yes, sir.
[55:40.60]What the heck?
[55:40.96]Wait, it was an admin?
[55:42.08]It's always me.
[55:44.90]Dude, come on.
[55:46.81]Why?
[55:47.35]I am so glad I have this turned way the fuck down.
[55:54.35]I have this turned down to like 0.2 and it still was bad.
[55:58.27]My initial reaction instantly when it showed up was laughing because I just knew you were going to get freaked out.
[56:03.89]It didn't even scare me.
[56:04.61]It's just like, oh God, this is gold.
[56:06.11]Dude, I have Roblox at like 20% and it's turned down over here too.
[56:14.07]Why do you use like the oldest screamer of the internet?
[56:16.59]I thought that was you, dude.
[56:19.56]I don't know how.
[56:22.40]Well, because people are saying, dude, Ster is quiet, Ster is quiet.
[56:25.24]So I turn you up.
[56:26.72]So that means that I'm doing something to harm you.
[56:30.41]No, you don't understand.
[56:31.75]So I like, I go over to Discord and I'm like, oh, Ster is quiet.
[56:35.65]I thought that you had this, you muted because you said you were muted.
[56:38.15]You were like, oh, yeah, sorry.
[56:39.15]I was muted for a minute.
[56:40.39]I just said that.
[56:40.99]So you were muted.
[56:41.90]And I'm like, alright.
[56:42.50]So he was just fucking muted.
[56:43.82]So then, hey, hey, Jerma, Ster is quiet.
[56:46.74]Like, I thought you guys were conspiring in your chat to make me turn you up in Discord.
[56:51.20]So I go over, I turn you up in Discord.
[56:53.26]And the next thing that happens is, oh, holy shit.
[56:56.48]I really thought that was you.
[56:57.28]I'm sorry.
[56:59.66]Maybe it was.
[57:03.29]Are we still in here?
[57:04.01]Uh, we're going, we're, uh, I think we're ready for the scary game now.
[57:10.66]I think you're all like warmed up.
[57:13.22]I just heard a laughing laugh.
[57:14.94]Alright, dude, I don't trust any developer anymore.
[57:19.02]This game is running at like 0.5% volume for the next, for the remainder of the stream.
[57:23.24]Alright, let's do a scary game.
[57:30.22]Okay.
[57:35.34]Why is it trying to get me to buy shit?
[57:36.88]I didn't... Spend!
[57:46.20]Hopefully that wasn't too bad, because that was fucking awful.
[57:49.14]I'm really sorry.

[59:18.52]Hey.
[59:20.42]Watch out.
[59:20.98]It's going to get you.
[59:27.03]Turn up your volume?
[59:28.05]I refuse.
[59:29.13]Not after that.
[59:29.61]I can't.
[59:34.35]I would go giggle loud.
[59:35.59]I'll turn it up a little.
[59:52.36]Just enough.
[59:54.80]That's as high as it's going.
[59:58.78]Okay.
[60:01.70]Meow meow?
[60:03.54]Meow meow meow?
[60:04.87]Oh, it is in first person.
[60:06.17]Alright, two headphones going in.
[60:11.67]Dude.
[60:20.80]Okay, hold on.
[60:22.00]I can't look down.
[60:23.44]I can't look down like that.
[60:25.04]Because, okay.
[60:34.56]Okay, we're not... We're not in on it.
[60:37.52]We gotta go indoors, I think.
[60:42.46]Scared.
[60:44.82]There's a sprint.
[60:46.32]Alright, here's 0001.
[60:47.36]Alright, we need a key.
[60:49.88]There's a key over here.
[60:52.64]Grab the key.
[60:55.35]Nice.
[60:55.67]Wow, we beat level one already.
[60:57.59]I found loot.
[60:58.61]Your hand is so big.
[61:01.47]I'm... Yeah, it's kind of large.
[61:05.40]Alright, we got the first key.
[61:11.73]That's all I can see.
[61:15.83]Oh, you have to hide from the monster.
[61:17.35]I get it.
[61:18.67]Wait, why are there so many?
[61:23.16]It's a tutorial, I presume.
[61:33.50]Okay.
[61:34.44]Okay.
[61:35.06]Okay.
[61:39.78]Nice and warm.
[61:41.60]Dude, I'm not gonna lie.
[61:42.30]I just heard something.
[61:45.66]Oh, there's fucking nothing in here.
[61:49.92]There's nothing in there.
[61:54.30]Turn it up.
[61:57.17]Alright, it actually... I got a shotgun.
[61:58.39]It actually might be, like, loud, so just seriously be careful turning your fucking volume down.
[62:01.79]Okay.
[62:08.39]Okay.
[62:16.62]That was pretty sus of you.
[62:18.30]That was kind of delayed from my end, too.
[62:20.80]I'm so on edge after that fucking gun game we played.
[62:23.70]I can't believe that happened.
[62:25.04]There's something in here, but I can't touch it.
[62:31.96]Never mind.
[62:32.38]We're gone.
[62:33.24]Gold on table.
[62:35.58]What do you use the money for, I wonder?
[62:38.62]More doors.
[62:40.47]Oh.
[62:43.13]I lied to him.
[62:48.96]And you accept my Roblox friend request.
[62:50.56]It's my birthday.
[62:53.48]I mean, we're just... It's just everybody's birthday today.
[62:56.08]So happy birthday.
[62:57.42]Something's going to happen.
[62:59.74]This is the room where it flips it on you.
[63:02.02]You go first.
[63:02.96]Open it.
[63:03.98]I didn't open that.
[63:06.54]Somebody else did.
[63:07.28]Uh-oh, dude.
[63:08.80]Go.
[63:09.39]You got to go.
[63:10.89]I got your back.
[63:14.15]Nothing in here?
[63:16.89]What was that?
[63:17.85]I don't know.
[63:18.13]I'm hiding.
[63:19.07]I heard someone knock.
[63:21.24]Wait, did I just kick you out?
[63:23.00]No.
[63:23.20]Okay.
[63:37.09]This would be way scarier if we didn't all look like dickheads.
[63:41.99]You know what I mean?
[63:43.01]To me, this is not scary anymore because, Ster, your character looks like this.
[63:47.73]It's no longer scary.
[63:49.19]I mean, your hands.
[63:50.73]You're the scariest dude here.
[63:54.22]Your hands have so much detail in veins.
[63:59.12]Do they really?
[63:59.70]I didn't even... Yeah, they do.
[64:02.44]They're very weird.
[64:03.98]It looks so fucked up if I look down, by the way.
[64:12.15]It honestly just...
[64:19.51]This painting is titled Temple.
[64:24.53]Ooh.
[64:26.17]Interesting.
[64:29.55]Cool.
[64:32.93]I had to walk up to you and look down to see you.
[64:40.18]What?
[64:40.32]That wasn't even that bad.
[64:41.60]I just didn't think it was... Alright.
[64:44.04]It was a fucking... We didn't see anything.
[64:46.42]We just saw your character go...
[64:50.67]There was a spider inside of the thing and I was like, oh a spider then it jumped on my face.
[64:56.05]Oh No, I'm not opening anything That was such an overreaction to holy shit That's the thumbnail for the YouTube video don't do that again Oh, it's Jesus Christ, but roblox
[65:22.55]titled the last pizza party oh my goodness if only god knew what we were doing down here we've lost our way okay
[65:50.62]I am not touching that.
[65:52.30]You are.
[65:52.62]I think that's kind of scary.
[66:00.94]So this is door 12.
[66:02.44]I'm not opening this.
[66:04.64]Oh, dude.
[66:07.00]Door number 13.
[66:10.12]You know what that means?
[66:10.96]I got something.
[66:12.14]What's that?
[66:12.90]Which means it goes here.
[66:16.39]Good thinking.
[66:18.34]That doesn't fit there, stupid.
[66:20.72]You're stupid.
[66:27.39]Oh, door 13, dude!
[66:34.19]Oh, why am I opening these?
[66:35.21]How many doors are there?
[66:50.04]Of course.
[66:50.38]That's a good question.
[66:56.25]Oh!
[66:57.05]What's that?
[67:00.23]Don't mock me.
[67:01.55]Did it not happen at the same time?
[67:04.19]Oh shit, run!
[67:05.01]Jesus!
[67:05.55]That was so quick!
[67:16.50]Hide.
[67:17.08]There was only one.
[67:18.28]I didn't see it coming.
[67:19.48]I did for a second.
[67:24.48]I looked behind.
[67:25.24]It was so fast.
[67:28.73]Alright.
[67:29.23]Let's do it again.
[67:29.71]That was fun.
[67:38.25]That was fun.
[67:42.09]I think it was the lights flickering.
[67:44.32]And then you could hear like a sound effect too.
[67:48.28]Yeah.
[67:54.28]Yeah, that was fun.
[67:57.16]Yeah, that was fun.
[68:00.63]Yeah, so I put a bunch of filler words in.
[68:02.73]Oh, we can buy stuff.
[68:06.83]I have no money.
[68:07.67]Yeah, I don't either.
[68:12.87]I'll ask my mom if she can give me a wave of cards.
[68:22.54]Alright.
[68:23.28]001.
[68:25.39]I feel like my game got twice as quiet.
[68:30.37]I turned up a little, but not that high.
[68:33.60]I'm maxed everywhere I can be maxed.
[68:38.17]I can't hear anything anymore.
[68:39.51]You guys want to just try to get back to 12?
[68:41.39]Yeah.
[68:41.51]Let's go.
[68:51.64]Oh, my God.
[68:52.20]That was... Nothing.
[68:56.30]Hold on.
[69:10.31]Oh, I think if you guys went too far forward, I took damage and it teleported me to you.
[69:14.99]Oh.
[69:23.14]Poke, you're like sneaking and leaning.
[69:25.44]That looks great.
[69:34.51]Alright, that one's kind of messed up.
[69:36.80]Is this door going to have a mouth or something to open and eat us?
[69:42.34]Is that what you thought about?
[69:43.58]I don't know.
[69:43.90]It looks like teeth right here.
[69:45.60]It's going to be like a mimic.
[69:47.74]Is it a mimic door?
[69:54.45]I'm just going to 13.
[69:55.77]Yep.
[69:58.95]Oh, shit!
[69:59.57]What was that?
[70:00.94]I don't know.
[70:01.30]I'm going in here.
[70:02.52]I don't know.
[70:02.86]What was that?
[70:03.34]I don't know.
[70:07.59]Is it safe to come out?
[70:08.68]Yeah, we're fine.
[70:12.72]Where's Ster?
[70:13.86]I'm here.
[70:14.42]I'm behind you.
[70:15.16]I'm not stealthy.
[70:16.04]I picked rogue class at the beginning of this.
[70:19.42]Oh.
[70:19.54]Okay.
[70:22.24]Alright, there's 11.
[70:34.39]Get it!
[70:34.77]Get it closer!
[70:35.79]I need one!
[70:37.18]Get in!
[70:37.80]We're good.
[70:46.86]He just ran by.
[70:49.59]Is it safe?
[70:50.85]Why is my character dying?
[70:52.99]My screen is flickering.
[70:54.03]I'm tripping out.
[70:55.49]Get out.
[70:55.79]It says get out.
[70:56.55]I got out.
[70:56.95]I got out.
[70:57.53]I got out.
[70:58.03]I got out.
[70:58.37]13.
[71:01.31]It's very dark.
[71:05.56]Do we all make it?
[71:07.24]Yeah.
[71:07.92]I'm dying, though.
[71:09.60]If I get spooked one more time, I'm done.
[71:12.88]I'm done, dude.
[71:13.93]Can't take much spooks.
[71:19.43]My last spook.
[71:21.35]Fourteen.
[71:27.65]I got one good spook left in me.
[71:29.21]I hear fire.
[71:29.72]What's this room?
[71:32.50]Oh, it's rain.
[71:33.48]That's someone...
[71:36.48]Someone's frying a chicken.
[71:37.62]What's this?
[71:41.16]Oh, I got a lighter.
[71:41.86]It has a fuel, though.
[71:50.94]Keys right here.
[71:53.79]Oh, nice.
[71:55.67]Everyone got one.
[71:56.67]If a monster comes out as you stab them.
[71:59.49]Right in the eye.
[72:03.09]Oh.
[72:07.62]Oh my god.
[72:09.15]This is fun.
[72:10.13]I'm just going in.
[72:18.54]We good?
[72:25.36]Something is whacking the books off the shelf and stuff.
[72:28.17]Yeah.
[72:38.65]Oh, Resident Evil.
[72:39.49]Save.
[72:43.44]Oh, okay.
[72:43.78]There's a lighter here.
[72:44.34]Have you guys played the remake at all?
[72:51.02]Resident Evil 4?
[72:53.00]Not yet.
[72:53.54]No.
[72:55.31]It's very good.
[72:58.85]Don't spoil it.
[73:16.43]You guys should play the brain game.
[73:17.75]We're playing doors.
[73:20.69]We're opening doors.
[73:22.93]I'm sensing a spooker coming.
[73:24.89]I don't know about it.
[73:30.51]There's a lot of these.
[73:31.61]Uh oh.
[73:36.08]I win.
[73:49.11]We have to get out now, right?
[73:52.17]Yeah.
[73:54.13]It's still dark.
[73:54.77]You got your lighter?
[73:59.04]Oh, I do have a lighter.
[74:01.94]It's very dark.
[74:04.50]Uh-oh.
[74:06.14]Oh my god!
[74:06.58]I just died.
[74:07.42]Oh my god, you did.
[74:10.56]That's kind of sus.
[74:11.45]Where's the right door?
[74:14.77]This is 20.
[74:15.51]This way, this way, this way.
[74:20.45]Do you have a lighter?
[74:21.83]No.
[74:27.40]It's all mine.
[74:27.82]None of this is yours.
[74:33.72]Um... Um... What?
[74:36.40]We gotta hide.
[74:37.48]Trust me, hide.
[74:39.08]Yeah, there's like... There's like cold air coming.
[74:43.34]Is that poke respawning?
[74:44.87]Or is that a monster?
[74:46.03]Hey guys, cost 30 robux from here.
[74:51.54]You've paid to come back.
[74:52.82]That's awesome.
[74:55.70]Yeah, my mom said I could come play again.
[74:58.40]Nice.
[74:59.44]Oh, shit.
[74:59.80]That's a spider.
[75:01.38]The spider scared me.
[75:02.18]It's awful.
[75:02.54]The spider scared me.
[75:03.58]It's so bad.
[75:04.42]Thanks, Mrs. Lawls.
[75:16.89]Why don't we just crawl out of the chimney?
[75:20.07]Let's go.
[75:22.42]Good luck.
[75:25.20]We don't know how tall this building is.
[75:26.54]Are you out of your mind?
[75:29.40]This building could be like 50 stories, Ster.
[75:31.98]And then, oh yeah, go up there.
[75:33.44]Once you get halfway, you get exhausted, then what are you going to do?
[75:36.42]I like how you have hair on your avatar.
[75:38.94]Just like under that.
[75:40.24]I do?
[75:40.40]You have hair.
[75:41.50]Yeah.
[75:42.04]You kind of got like mutton chops.
[75:44.48]I have hair?
[75:44.85]On your fire.
[75:46.29]Oh, because it's a mask, right?
[75:49.25]Yeah.
[75:49.45]I think technically.
[75:53.34]I feel like something's going to happen.
[75:58.59]I have nothing.
[75:59.95]I'm dead.
[76:01.29]You're dead?
[76:01.65]No, I'm good.
[76:02.63]I'm good.
[76:03.77]I'm good.
[76:05.51]Just put your credit card in again.
[76:09.87]I'm not scared.
[76:10.65]I'm rich.
[76:13.81]Why would you be scared?
[76:14.68]Alright.
[76:15.74]I'm almost out of fuel in this thing.
[76:21.68]Oh, you just skipped a 30?
[76:22.72]There's 229.
[76:23.30]Holy shit!
[76:23.71]I went in 30.
[76:24.75]Holy shit.
[76:25.79]Did you guys see what happened or no?
[76:27.03]I saw it scream at you and push you down.
[76:28.55]Where are you?
[76:29.05]I'm behind.
[76:29.27]We're coming.
[76:29.65]Holy crap.
[76:31.53]Did you go to 31?
[76:31.85]No, we were behind you.
[76:32.33]Oh, okay.
[76:33.03]I just kept running.
[76:51.62]I'm super jumpy today too already.
[76:53.24]But just for no reason.
[76:54.84]This is just... I apologize that I'm being like... Making like a hilarious YouTube video right now.
[77:02.67]I don't know what's going on.
[77:03.47]There's an eye right there.
[77:04.49]I don't like... I don't know if I'm supposed to... I don't have a credit card.
[77:08.56]I think it's like an Enderman.
[77:09.28]You have to stare at it.
[77:09.98]I have this.
[77:10.74]I got this, so...
[77:13.24]Yeah, I don't know dude.
[77:16.18]I just fucking swallowed like five gallons of spit right there.
[77:21.96]So don't look at it?
[77:23.73]I don't know.
[77:26.25]I don't have a credit card.
[77:27.37]I'm scared.
[77:30.65]Alright, this is getting kind of fucked up, so I don't... I'm gonna hide.
[77:34.01]I think we're fine.
[77:39.86]Are we okay?
[77:42.52]I think it's got a flicker.
[77:44.92]There's an eye flickering everywhere.
[77:46.82]Yeah.
[77:51.63]I don't know if we look or don't.
[77:57.11]Oh.
[77:58.69]Something is... What's going on?
[78:01.61]I don't know.
[78:02.39]Lots of flickers.
[78:04.53]I feel like my graphics card is overheating.
[78:13.54]Uh, we need a key.
[78:15.36]Shit.
[78:19.64]There's a door up here.
[78:20.48]Ah, right here on the floor.
[78:23.41]Key under table.
[78:24.45]Nice.
[78:26.27]There's gold on table in Riften.
[78:28.81]Go back.
[78:44.62]Oh, excuse me?
[78:45.70]That scared me.
[78:46.60]What happened?
[78:48.40]It's a cut scene.
[78:52.51]Oh.
[78:55.99]Who is it going after?
[78:57.59]Oh, it's like a run section.
[78:58.81]I went right.
[79:03.31]I went right.
[79:03.81]Okay.
[79:05.61]Right is right.
[79:10.20]I went straight.
[79:11.38]All the way.
[79:22.30]We made it!
[79:23.92]Holy... We did it.
[79:24.72]It's gone.
[79:26.34]Gosh, it's... It's coming!
[79:28.96]It's still here!
[79:29.94]Is it?
[79:30.60]What?
[79:33.30]Oh, you're lying.
[79:33.88]Pretty good.
[79:38.52]Nice job, guys.
[79:39.72]I paid not to see it, so... Watch out.
[79:44.36]Paid not to see it?
[79:45.76]I turned it off.
[79:47.12]You pay money and you just don't see anything scary?
[79:52.82]Nice.

[80:54.93]I did the switch.
[80:57.91]Yeah, but we didn't collect the three gems.
[80:59.97]There's a green gem, a red gem, and a blue gem.
[81:02.77]You have to put the red gem into the eye of the statue.
[81:05.96]The blue gem has to go into the... And one's a fish, and one's a bird, and one's a snake.

[81:56.65]The way he just died on my screen.
[82:03.93]There's fake doors?
[82:05.01]I didn't know that.
[82:08.76]The way he just fell over and it's just red.
[82:10.64]Like he just died.
[82:12.40]Can I spectate you guys?
[82:14.38]You can- OH SHIT!

[82:17.43]What the fuck, man?
[82:19.87]What happened?
[82:21.03]I don't know.
[82:22.27]I opened the door and I got glitched.
[82:24.57]Oh, wait a minute.
[82:26.72]This is scary, man.
[82:28.68]Revive yourself.
[82:29.30]Put money in.

[82:32.04]Oh, yeah.
[82:32.58]Let's go.
[82:35.00]30 bucks.
[82:35.66]Easy.
[82:35.96]There's a Velociraptor.
[82:36.73]I heard a Velociraptor.
[82:39.11]He's back.
[82:41.09]He just spawns and dies for you.
[82:44.37]Where am I?
[82:44.85]Oh.
[82:48.53]This next room, there's a Velociraptor.
[82:50.53]Is the boss fight at floor 50?
[82:52.53]I think it is.
[82:52.99]Do we have to actually fight it?
[83:00.09]Doesn't even know where we are.
[83:00.82]This thing's an idiot.
[83:02.76]It's right at us.
[83:06.22]I think we just have to avoid it.
[83:16.55]Oh, the right side.
[83:19.17]Where are we going?
[83:21.41]Your hands just come out the door.
[83:23.17]Yeah, we see your hands, dude.
[83:25.40]I panicked.
[83:29.74]Your thumb just comes out.
[83:31.02]It looks kind of weird.
[83:39.04]Where is it?
[83:41.28]The middle.
[83:44.34]I think we can get to the door.
[83:46.88]Yep.
[83:47.16]I made it to the terminal.
[83:47.98]It's a big lock.
[83:49.40]It needs a code.
[83:50.04]Do you have any idea what the code is?
[83:53.05]No, dude.
[83:54.49]Yes.
[83:55.53]Try your birthday.
[83:56.59]It's too many digits.
[83:59.78]We have to find the code in this room.
[84:02.80]I found it.
[84:03.84]Really?
[84:04.72]Yeah, it's in this table on the right.
[84:05.86]Holy shit.
[84:06.40]What is it?
[84:07.64]It has something glowing on it.
[84:09.56]I don't have to get to it.
[84:14.28]He's coming over here.
[84:14.80]He's coming over here.
[84:17.52]Poke, I think he's going to you.
[84:19.30]Yeah.
[84:21.60]Oh, no, he's not.
[84:22.57]You see it over here?
[84:23.65]Straight ahead.
[84:25.27]Oh, okay.
[84:27.27]So we gotta go down.
[84:30.11]Who's going?
[84:31.05]Who's going to be brave?
[84:31.87]I don't got a credit card.
[84:32.96]He's coming.
[84:34.36]Oh, never mind.
[84:41.38]I'll just damn bait him.
[84:42.72]Yeah, he doesn't get it.
[84:43.72]He doesn't understand.
[84:49.48]Wait, maybe he does.
[84:51.12]Wait, he gets it.
[84:51.82]I wonder if he can hear us.
[85:01.47]Yeah, bait him again.
[85:02.23]I'm going to make a break for it to get the... Hey!
[85:05.69]Hey, dumb head, over here!
[85:07.21]Uh-oh!
[85:15.15]I'm... I'm going, I'm going.
[85:18.85]Is he catching up?
[85:19.69]Q or E?
[85:20.23]Q or E?
[85:21.25]Is he catching up, though?
[85:22.53]Q, E?
[85:24.46]Get out of there, Jerma.
[85:25.18]Oh, I'm fine.
[85:26.02]I think I'm alright.
[85:27.26]I think I did the QTE, whatever it was.
[85:29.14]Oh, shit!
[85:32.48]I found it.
[85:33.42]It's like a puzzle.
[85:34.04]I don't... I can't understand this.
[85:40.72]It's stuck?
[85:41.80]It's stuck in the wall.
[85:43.02]I think he's coming after me, but I don't know what happened.
[85:46.70]He's stuck in the wall.
[85:47.28]He looks like really stuck.
[85:49.57]Use the opportunity and get the code.
[85:51.57]Get the paper.
[85:52.31]It's...
[85:57.82]I don't get it.
[85:58.58]I'm doing a mini game.
[85:59.82]Oh, my God.
[86:00.36]He's right up.
[86:01.64]Okay, he got me.
[86:02.82]He got me.
[86:03.22]I'll get my credit card.
[86:04.10]I'll be there in a minute.
[86:08.28]He's distracted with me.
[86:09.14]I got my credit card.
[86:10.36]Good, good, good.
[86:17.97]Oh, never mind.
[86:18.49]I can't.
[86:21.57]That's what it looked like.
[86:23.23]I don't know.
[86:24.15]I can't see the paper.
[86:25.69]You can't pick it up?
[86:28.59]No, it's in your hand.
[86:30.99]Imagine being in this scenario and being terrified.
[86:32.89]He's stuck.
[86:33.27]Yeah, he killed me.
[86:34.49]I think it got stuck in the closet that I was in.
[86:38.16]Did you see this?
[86:44.88]Yeah, I fucked his ass up.
[86:47.80]You didn't see what happened on my screen.
[86:49.47]I fucking knocked three of his teeth out.
[86:51.59]I took a candlestick and I fucking whacked him in the head.
[86:54.13]I pushed a bookcase over.
[86:55.13]I broke his leg.
[86:56.47]I did that.
[87:00.88]I got the book.
[87:01.90]I got you guys.
[87:03.42]The book says seven in it.
[87:08.60]You guys need glasses so bad.
[87:10.10]Holy shit.
[87:11.48]Even without the monster here, I don't think we're getting past this.
[87:14.38]We're not smart.
[87:23.01]Did he get out?
[87:24.05]Oh, that was a bad voice crack.
[87:25.45]I found another book.
[87:27.92]Square is zero.
[87:33.40]I think I get it.
[87:35.43]Triangle equals what?
[87:37.77]Oh, gosh.
[87:45.57]But I can't look at the books again.
[87:48.24]Oh, it's on the bottom left of my screen.
[87:49.74]You just need to pick up books.
[87:57.86]I love this this is so funny x equals six I got it weird rayon scribblings that you guys have to read okay poke should be nine seven nine seven six
[88:31.52]And then five.
[88:34.08]This is so funny.
[88:39.34]Oh man.
[88:41.91]Imagine a monster is behind, killed your friend.
[88:44.89]Your friend just died by a monster.
[88:46.57]The monster stuck like fucking the wicked witch of the West under a fucking bookcase.
[88:50.87]And you're sitting there like, um, I, you know, I can't really tell where, how do we get out of here?
[88:55.92]What's the code?
[88:56.64]I think I found it.
[88:57.64]Oh, it's so funny.
[89:02.40]zero so what is it in order again nine seven nine seven six eight five zero that's too many oh there's only five switcheroos okay it should be nine nine six

[90:36.59]Yeah, it says you can only revive once.
[90:41.82]Unless you guys can bring me back.
[90:43.00]Yeah, it says you can only revive in a run once, unfortunately.
[90:47.86]Oh.
[90:49.23]I'm enjoying this, though.
[90:50.39]Go for it.
[90:51.33]As far as you can.

[91:18.15]Oh.

[105:49.49]I put 48.
[105:49.90]48?
[105:49.96]Yeah.
[105:55.14]I'm trying to think of the stripes, right?

[106:34.75]I answered first.
[106:35.41]What?
[106:36.87]Looks like you might not have answered first then, pal.
[106:39.56]Maybe it's because I chose the category.
[106:40.84]I don't know.
[106:42.94]I like how I'm completely covered by him.
[106:44.44]Even my answer was covered.
[106:49.04]He's standing just right... Uh-oh.
[106:54.62]Hey, hey.
[106:59.58]Whoa, no.
[107:00.08]Put him down.

[107:08.73]Get that guy out of here.
[107:14.03]So cool.
[107:23.32]I'm actually taking this seriously now because I don't want Ster to win.
[107:27.28]Remember when I beat you with GeoGuessr?
[107:28.56]Every day.
[107:31.54]Yeah.
[107:38.95]When I see it, I'll probably know.
[107:39.79]Shit.
[107:39.97]I literally just, like, read about this too, I think.
[107:41.11]I actually don't- I didn't even click a- I was gonna click- I was gonna click it!

[108:56.79]Star got it wrong.
[108:57.39]I know it.
[109:00.73]How did I... I had a brain moment.
[109:06.60]Oh, I'm so dumb.
[109:08.98]I thought he overthought it.
[109:12.56]I always overthink those and go, wait a minute, is it two?
[109:14.51]I wanted to click it quick, but then I realized if I did, I was... My game's bugged and it's picking the wrong answer.
[109:19.95]I don't know what's happening.
[109:24.15]Man, that sucks.

[109:35.79]I'm trying to fix it.
[109:36.63]The dancing banana makes me uncomfortable, but I can't quite pinpoint what it is about him.
[109:41.90]It's not his shape, and it's not his smell.

[119:28.38]Can somebody revive me?
[119:30.30]I'll try.

[120:45.79]You're back.
[120:46.27]You didn't get to see it?
[120:47.90]No, I saw that picture, but I heard the sound.
[120:53.22]The noise.
[120:53.86]Oh, I shouldn't exit then.
[120:54.58]No, did you exit?
[120:58.34]No.
[121:08.89]Oh, that was perfect.

[121:37.16]Now that I know that 2017 haunting image is actually haunting me now in a game, I'm prepared.
[121:44.32]It's doing the mini-sensory sound.
[121:45.64]You know how many children have died to you?
[121:51.06]You just think about that.
[121:52.82]You've haunted so much children probably.
[121:54.60]How many children have I haunted?
[121:58.18]Like five years when they grow up a bit and they see you walking towards them.
[122:01.70]Or even if they don't grow up, they just actually see you in public walking towards them.
[122:07.37]and you're probably like mumbling to yourself as you do alright are we ready real life are we good to go yeah we're in it right I don't know how it starts I think it's I had to click leaderboards then exit yes oh yeah you're actually just standing there yeah I was in the same I had the same problem I'm not I don't that's how I died last time
[122:38.22]Oh shit!
[122:39.82]Who's that?
[122:40.62]What is that?

[123:03.44]Oh!
[123:05.89]I got you.
[123:07.77]It's coming!
[123:17.00]I feel like I'm inside of a TikTok video.
[123:19.28]You know what I mean?
[123:20.12]I feel like I'm inside of one.
[123:23.34]I'm downed.
[123:30.79]You have to see that video in the future.
[123:33.45]God damn.
[123:35.98]The chestnuts guy.

[123:47.34]That's such a bizarre image.
[123:56.04]Oh no.
[123:56.54]That was so weird.
[123:58.87]I think there's a bunch of random monster images.
[124:02.19]And the fact that we got you first is like... That's so funny.
[124:05.27]That couldn't be even perfect.
[124:13.78]Oh, no.
[124:14.00]Help us.
[124:14.32]Help us.
[124:16.82]I think this person is going to throw me into the pit.
[124:20.76]I think that's what's going on here.
[124:22.08]Are you going to throw me into the pit?
[124:26.24]Oh, okay.
[124:26.78]You were saving me.
[124:27.54]Thank you.

[124:39.49]Menu?
[124:40.67]Press M and go menu.
[124:41.61]I think we could vote a new map or something.

[124:46.94]Oh, never mind.
[124:50.58]Other modes?
[124:57.53]You have this equipment?
[124:58.83]What?
[125:03.42]I don't think I have anything.
[125:09.41]Should we vote for something else or just go play?
[125:13.53]Special round.
[125:15.37]What does that say?
[125:18.88]Are you guys still in that same game?
[125:20.46]Yeah.

[126:51.59]He's too big.
[126:57.15]Yes, thank you.
[126:59.76]Oh.

[166:43.19]P. I'm going.
[166:44.45]Yeah.
[166:50.73]He's an absolute goddamn Sturvert.
[166:55.49]I don't know.
[166:56.81]He kind of has a tendency to go over the line.
[167:02.41]And I do not condone him going over the line.
[167:05.09]I don't.
[167:12.68]You were playing a kid's game.
[167:18.70]I actually really, that was actually very fun.
[167:22.12]That was so fucking cool.
[167:34.60]You do not condone.
[167:37.40]Yeah, when I look over at him and he's like, talks about, you know, I'm not even going to say it.
[167:41.80]I don't even have to say anything.
[167:45.36]Alright, I'll see you in a minute.
[167:57.73]Oh, I just said I don't condone me.
[168:01.69]You know what?
[168:02.21]I can't even say it.
[168:02.93]I don't want to say it.
[168:05.79]You I don't want to get out of here.
[168:08.95]Get out here.
[168:09.95]You left.
[168:30.05]I looked over at you.
[168:30.79]You told me that you said a weird thing about me.
[168:34.38]You know what I mean?
[168:41.96]I'm not repeating it.
[168:42.96]I'm out of here.
[168:47.96]I was just fucking with you.
[168:51.94]Were we talking?
[168:53.49]Okay.
[168:55.17]No, no, no.
[168:55.71]Listen, listen.
[168:58.89]It started with an M. And it was four letters.
[169:04.19]And now I'm leaving.
[169:07.66]I'll see you later.
[169:13.55]Alright, get out of here.
[169:15.21]I'm still playing.
[169:16.21]I'm still streaming.
[169:22.29]Oh, they can't even hear you.
[169:23.81]Oh, shit.
[169:24.19]Sorry.
[169:24.39]Oh, they can't?
[169:25.21]No, I was wondering.
[169:26.02]Okay, there you are.
[169:27.46]Oh, my God.
[169:28.04]They literally can't even hear you.
[169:29.32]Yeah, we've been talking.
[169:30.28]That's funny.
[169:32.18]Alright, well, okay.
[169:33.46]Everybody thought it was a hot mic.
[169:35.10]No, I'm talking on Pogue stream, too.
[169:39.26]No, Pogue stopped streaming.
[169:41.19]I ended my stream, then I raided Poke, and Poke was already gone.
[169:45.47]And then people were in my chat like, Jerma is dissing you.
[169:48.31]He's doing a diss track right now.
[169:49.73]And I was like, what?
[169:51.43]What's going on?
[169:52.23]And then I saw that you were going to go pee.
[169:54.69]And I don't know.
[169:55.91]I don't know, man.
[169:57.09]So I went BRB on mine, and it looked like this was a hot mic scenario.
[170:00.97]That's funny.
[170:02.29]And this is all because I said something about 2% milk.
[170:08.42]In that category.
[170:11.28]uh story if you apparently owe the mods hazard pay hazard what alright alright I have to go pee
[170:21.16]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[170:23.43]I just want to say, you know what?
[170:24.71]I'm getting distracted.
[170:25.81]I just want to say, me and Jerma planned a whole bunch of games to play together, and we were going to do some fun stuff, and then one guy in his chat says, oh, okay, it's my birthday on Wednesday.
[170:40.23]Can we do Roblox birthday?
[170:42.07]And he's like, oh, yeah, fuck everything I was planning with Star.
[170:45.33]We're doing Roblox for your birthday.
[170:46.98]You're going to deny the birthday party?
[170:48.44]How dare you?
[170:49.32]So if I have to say something about milking someone one time, I'm owed that.
[170:57.32]I felt tension.
[171:05.70]I'm not even streaming.
[171:07.35]I spit water all over my desk.
[171:09.71]My whole monitor is covered.
[171:13.11]I have never done like an actual spit take in real life.
[171:15.79]That was so much water.
[171:21.17]Fuck.
[171:22.25]Ster, can you say happy birthday, please?
[171:25.35]To the birthday.
[171:26.84]I don't know who it is.
[171:27.76]Neither do I. Alright, I actually have to go VRB.
[171:35.26]Okay, but what do you do when you come back?
[171:36.98]I don't know.
[171:38.94]He still hasn't pissed.
[171:41.46]Yeah, I have to go pee.
[171:43.54]Okay.
[171:45.56]What's the plan?
[171:45.98]Are we going to keep playing or something?
[171:48.17]I'm down for whatever.
[171:54.15]I don't think he... I don't know if he's playing, but I'm going to play three of us if you guys want.
[172:00.79]Yeah, I wish I could.
[172:01.97]I gotta go.
[172:04.03]Any other time, no late nights.
[172:05.77]You guys are late night.
[172:07.20]We are late night, Andy.
[172:09.34]I can't.
[172:12.02]I gotta go put the kid to bed.
[172:13.24]I'll see you guys.
[172:14.34]Yeah, no, thanks for playing, Stuart.
[172:17.48]Wait, he has a kid now?
[172:20.14]I have no idea.
[172:25.53]Alright, I'll be... Yeah, we can set something up.
[172:28.46]I can just pivot to like... I was going to play Breath of the Wild or something.
[172:31.70]If there's something else you want to play, we could just play something right now if you wanted to.
[172:36.73]I mean... If not, I could play BOTW.
[172:40.87]Okay, hold on.
[172:41.99]Since we don't have a crew for the scary game...
[172:44.64]We should save it for another time.
[172:46.34]Yeah.
[172:46.56]And you enjoy Breath of the Wild.
[172:49.49]That sounds awesome.
[172:50.81]Hey, I had a lot of fun.
