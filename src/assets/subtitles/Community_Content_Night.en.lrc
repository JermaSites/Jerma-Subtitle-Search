[00:00.91]Good afternoon.
[00:01.83]Hello.
[00:05.35]Hi.
[00:07.87]Hope everyone's having a good day.
[00:08.89]I know I saw you last night and the night before, but, you know, just checking in on you.
[00:17.40]Today, we have a very special stream.
[00:22.88]One of, hopefully, many of these.
[00:26.88]You probably saw the title change earlier, like an hour ago.
[00:30.82]We're going to do the Community Content Night.
[00:37.34]I've been talking about these for a long time.
[00:40.44]And the first one's going to be tonight.
[00:43.52]Or today, depending on where you are.
[00:46.48]These streams will be once every month or two.
[00:51.87]I am going to monitor, because there was a lot of submissions.
[00:55.17]So, I'm going to try to monitor how long this stream was, right?
[00:59.63]And then, count how many, I guess I'm going to keep track of how many tabs I had, and how many length of the videos, and all that stuff.
[01:05.92]So, I have no idea.
[01:08.38]This stream might be long, it might be kind of short.
[01:10.56]But I want, this is the first one.
[01:11.94]This is an experiment.
[01:17.80]He's got a stream monitor open.
[01:21.99]Yep.
[01:24.30]You know when you have too many tabs?
[01:26.22]When Google Chrome no longer puts the new tabs on top of the screen.
[01:33.78]When I was clicking new tabs, it's like a ruler.
[01:39.34]Each increment of where a centimeter is a new tab.
[01:43.56]It's a ruler up here.
[01:45.48]A giant ruler.
[01:46.50]A yardstick.
[01:48.08]With centimeters on it.
[01:49.02]Those are hard to find.
[01:51.39]Not using Firefox.
[01:53.67]Well, I use Chrome on stream.
[01:57.97]I use Firefox for me.
[02:01.45]Fire- That's me.
[02:03.31]Chrome?
[02:04.07]Stream.
[02:05.64]Firefox?
[02:06.24]Me.
[02:08.02]Why do I do that?
[02:10.03]Well, that's because I do all of my things on Firefox.
[02:14.68]I do all of my banking on Firefox.
[02:19.00]I do all of my passwords going to Firefox.
[02:22.80]So Chrome is a completely separated, totally separate entity that is only for streams.
[02:33.20]Banking.
[02:37.64]All his Reddit accounts are on Firefox.
[02:45.08]Why do you have that many stream tabs open?
[02:47.24]What do you mean stream tabs?
[02:54.03]Not using Internet Explorer?
[02:56.27]Here's the thing about Edge.
[02:59.37]Isn't Edge kind of good now?
[03:04.51]I've heard that it's sort of good now.
[03:09.32]No, it's not.
[03:10.24]No.
[03:12.50]I've heard it's okay.
[03:13.92]They've been slowly building that browser to make it a little bit better for everybody, I think.
[03:21.76]But I like Firefox.
[03:24.17]Chrome is alright, but I don't know.
[03:26.71]When you do Ctrl-Alt-Delete, when you have one browser of Chrome open...
[03:31.35]I don't know why browsers do this.
[03:32.65]Some of them do.
[03:33.61]Why are there like 12 processes?
[03:37.43]When you have a Chrome browser open.
[03:38.86]Why?
[03:40.28]What does it do?
[03:41.74]Why can't it be one?
[03:48.76]It's one per tab.
[03:50.32]That's because Chrome sucks.
[03:53.68]Each process is a tab.
[03:55.32]No.
[03:56.58]How my number is doing?
[03:58.40]Oh, shit.
[04:00.50]I forgot to open it.
[04:02.26]I forgot to keep it open.
[04:03.66]I turned off my computer.
[04:06.19]I was gonna have it going for like 16 hours.
[04:09.31]Oh, well.
[04:10.31]I'm never playing it again now.
[04:11.91]That's the nail in the coffin right there.
[04:14.07]Not playing it again.
[04:17.78]Once you make a mistake like that, you cannot do that again.
[04:19.98]Now I have to... Oh, what?
[04:20.94]Am I gonna open it again?
[04:21.78]Wow, that's too much work.
[04:26.24]And speaking of work...
[04:28.92]I would like to change.
[04:30.38]We're gonna move on here.
[04:32.01]We're gonna start... There are a lot of videos.
[04:35.75]There are a lot of pieces of artwork.
[04:38.39]This is community content night number one.
[04:40.69]You were here for this one.
[04:42.55]You were here for the first one ever.
[04:50.50]So... Let's start with the artwork.
[04:55.62]Here it is.
[04:56.56]This is artwork number one.
[04:57.70]Now, one thing I do have to say for the future.
[05:03.18]In the future, it's probably a good idea for you guys to watermark these with your name.
[05:10.53]Because there are so many submissions that it's kind of, you know, it's hard to keep track of every single person.
[05:16.57]So, for the future, if you have something you want to put forward here, throw a watermark on it if you want people to know that it was you.
[05:28.30]It's mine now.
[05:30.40]Now, let's go.
[05:32.34]Should I do can for this?
[05:33.16]I don't want to do can.
[05:35.88]Should I?
[05:36.14]I'm like, alright, I'll just be down here at the bottom.
[05:43.15]Alright, so how do you, I don't use Chrome.
[05:45.81]How do you zoom in on Chrome?
[05:48.37]Is it control and scroll?
[05:50.49]What is it?
[05:54.33]This is, I don't use Chrome.
[05:55.27]This is my streaming computer.
[05:57.78]There we go.
[05:58.62]Alright, so this looks like, uh, Rumble.
[06:00.84]This is, isn't, this is, uh, Glue Man, Demon Lords of Raxos, and a bunch of other fucking crazy characters.
[06:07.05]So, we got, this isn't good.
[06:09.41]Demon Lords of Raxos is too strong, but if I fail, the Jerm of Rumble is doomed.
[06:14.27]You think you can beat me, you Glue Man, the original shit character?
[06:19.36]And then a big laugh.
[06:20.52]I'm a lord of all hells.
[06:21.46]You haven't got a chance.
[06:23.56]I may be the original shit character, but I won't give up.
[06:25.93]Not when all of my friends are counting on me.
[06:30.43]You can do it.
[06:31.17]All the beers agree on it.
[06:32.47]Beer.
[06:33.79]I make all the rules, kid.
[06:34.87]And my rule number one is don't lose to this asshole.
[06:37.86]Gloom Man, win this for all the shit characters.
[06:39.62]This is all the shitty characters.
[06:42.54]Well, that's not a shit character.
[06:45.76]Do the voices.
[06:49.06]You know, I need to sip my fucking Coca-Cola Classic before I can do that.
[06:57.33]I'm reading them.
[06:58.57]I am reading them.
[07:02.77]Oh, you can do it.
[07:04.03]All the beers agree on this.
[07:05.99]Beer.
[07:07.51]I make all the rules, kid, and number one is don't lose this guy.
[07:12.26]Batboy didn't have a voice.
[07:14.28]Blue Man, a witness for the shit characters.
[07:16.68]We believe in you.
[07:18.87]That's not what his voice is.
[07:19.87]That's a placeholder.
[07:20.83]It's a template.
[07:22.95]Uh, glue man can beat him.
[07:24.71]I bet all my goat eggs on it.
[07:27.26]And you can never have too many eggs.
[07:29.68]That's true.
[07:31.16]Hey, any of you fucking chump seed my grandson?
[07:34.36]The little shit fuckhead is late for the stream.
[07:44.77]That's the best character.
[07:46.05]It is.
[07:47.42]I'm not late.
[07:48.26]It's not even 2 o'clock.
[07:49.92]It's not even 2 o'clock.
[07:51.16]What are you on about?
[07:53.04]That was great.
[07:54.28]And look at how quickly we can just go like this.
[07:56.80]Here's another fan-out for the egg.
[07:59.13]Did someone ask for an egg?
[08:05.49]Balancing eggs.
[08:07.35]Very good.
[08:09.55]I'm early.
[08:10.01]I'm not early.
[08:10.55]I'm in the exact window.
[08:13.45]Good stuff.
[08:15.91]I did say this in the Rumble video, but the egg has only been in two videos ever.
[08:18.85]He just... He has... That's the test of time.
[08:23.37]You know when a character is just... is a great character?
[08:26.61]When they've been on camera and on screen for a collective maybe seven minutes in ten years of me doing this.
[08:41.60]This fireman.
[08:42.58]Observe this individual.
[08:44.06]This handsome fireman.
[08:50.11]That's terrifying.
[08:52.34]That's horrifying, but still cool at the same time.
[08:57.14]Am I gonna play Cube World?
[09:00.40]Are you gonna play Cube World?
[09:03.87]Did I just get asked if I'm gonna play Cube World?
[09:11.59]No, I'm not gonna play Cube World.
[09:15.92]This person said that this is drawn in the style of, I'm going to butcher this name, and it's a very popular, very, very talented artist, Genndy Tartovsky.
[09:30.53]Genndy Tartovsky.
[09:31.79]Torovsky?
[09:35.78]Phonetically spell it out for me, please.
[09:45.02]Bogus just almost flew out of my nose, and we're not even five minutes into the stream.
[09:49.88]He practiced that line for three hours.
[09:55.69]What?
[09:58.01]Gendi?
[10:00.79]Whatever.
[10:02.49]It's the guy that made Samurai Jack.
[10:05.17]Very cool.
[10:05.69]I love the line work.
[10:07.55]You're gonna get... By the way, I don't know anything about art.
[10:13.44]You're going to get weird positive things here.
[10:16.61]I'm going to be like, oh, I really love the color scheme.
[10:20.13]And then you're going to be like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[10:21.81]I don't know anything about color schemes.
[10:23.71]Idiot.
[10:24.11]And I'm going to be like, I don't know.
[10:24.93]I just like it.
[10:25.79]So I don't know anything.
[10:31.84]This is actually my ideal outfit.
[10:38.40]If I could wear this every day, I would.
[10:40.44]Like, I mean, I do.
[10:41.70]Besides, I mean, this is blue.
[10:43.40]But this is... Oh, I didn't show you this.
[10:46.28]This is... I got... Let me tell you something.
[10:48.06]I got a quick story for you.
[10:49.82]Take a look at this shit.
[10:50.58]I like this shirt a lot.
[10:51.95]And now I can never probably wear it again unless I get something like OxiClean or something to fix it.
[10:55.67]Take a look at this shit.
[10:57.59]I have coffee all over me.
[11:00.99]Can you guys see that?
[11:02.51]It's literally all over the whole shirt.
[11:10.10]Um, coffee shops do this thing sometimes where they fill your coffee so high to the brim that when the lid goes on it creates this fucking vacuum that sucks up the coffee and pushes it out of the top.
[11:26.87]because there's a bunch of ice in it and I don't know if it's like a cooling to heat rises I have no idea but they make they fill it to the brim so high that it's just obnoxiously high and then they go and when you grab it and you go over and you put your straw in you get sprayed by coffee because there's pressure in there somehow well I got coffee sprayed like it was like if you work at a coffee shop you got to go like three or four centimeters over under the line
[11:57.21]Come on.
[11:59.36]And I'm just sitting there going like, now what do I do?
[12:02.92]Now what do I do?
[12:03.90]Right?
[12:06.14]It wouldn't spray all over your shirt.
[12:07.64]Well, it was like, and I'm like, oh shit!
[12:10.38]And it started dripping down, down, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, and I'm like, oh!
[12:14.55]It was very, very fast.
[12:15.53]You can't react fast like that.
[12:20.77]Sorry for giving you more coffee, I guess.
[12:25.92]That's not customer error.
[12:29.08]That's called the coffee was filled too high to the top and it sprayed me.
[12:36.06]Customer error.
[12:41.39]You got extra coffee.
[12:42.93]No, I got extra ice.
[12:44.71]Because what they do at a lot of these coffee shops is they dump a fucking whole cooler worth of ice in your drink and then they pour like three shots of fucking liquid in there.
[12:55.97]And then over the course of a day, or of a few hours or whatever, or an hour, your ice melts and fills the rest of the drink up.
[13:02.33]It's just ice.
[13:02.85]You're drinking ice.
[13:04.29]That's why you say no ice.
[13:05.46]Or you say light ice, please.
[13:10.92]If you don't say light ice, you get like a tailgating party worth of fucking ice in your drink.
[13:16.52]Light ice.
[13:17.50]Then they go, you know, normal.
[13:21.96]Anyways, that's a great outfit.
[13:23.56]That's the outfit that I wear every day.
[13:26.09]This is during the Wyrma.
[13:29.86]There we go.
[13:30.20]See?
[13:30.38]There we go.
[13:30.90]Dragon Breath.
[13:31.40]There it is.
[13:33.72]Those of you that remember this stream, this is from the Dreams stream.
[13:41.25]Which I took the defeat there that I couldn't really do it.
[13:49.96]Why did you create me, Jeremy?
[13:51.46]I think this is based on the Garfield stuff, right?
[13:55.84]No, that's Worma.
[13:58.76]It's horrifying.
[13:59.56]This is exactly what it looked like.
[14:01.62]This is not... I mean, this is an artist's representation of Worma, but it's 100% accurate.
[14:11.43]And just in case you felt like sleeping tonight, here's the Jerm of Scorpion.
[14:20.53]You can't stop me, Jeremy.
[14:26.29]That's fucked up.
[14:27.09]Yeah, that is.
[14:30.19]Those of you that have played a certain video game, this is Ludwig.
[14:34.32]That's what I see.
[14:39.68]That's great.
[14:42.82]That's from Dragon Breath.
[14:43.52]Thank you.
[14:43.82]These are great.
[14:44.74]Very well done.
[14:46.96]They said this is my fursona.
[14:49.46]Frog, yeah, that's right.
[14:56.46]I don't know, I don't know, I don't know who that is.
[14:59.44]Is that, that's supposed to be me with the Star Wars shirt on.
[15:07.99]Frogs don't have fur.
[15:10.15]I don't give a shit.
[15:17.49]That's my frog soda.
[15:20.49]Fireman!
[15:21.25]Take a look.
[15:22.69]This is Clown Fireman.
[15:26.53]I mean, that's perfect.
[15:29.49]Timely.
[15:30.51]Timely as well.
[15:32.13]Look at this dude.
[15:35.04]He's so cute.
[15:35.74]I know.
[15:37.52]Fireman is the most adorable character, I think, that exists.
[15:42.30]You could make a whole franchise around Fireman.
[15:45.42]You could have a children's TV show.
[15:47.68]You could have a platformer.
[15:54.45]They could teach, like, safety and shit.
[15:59.01]Fireman walks into, like, rooms and, like, lights shit on fire.
[16:04.34]And then tells you, like, this is what you have to do!
[16:07.92]You're monetizing memes.
[16:12.64]Look out for this dude.
[16:18.11]Sell out the character, we'll totally hate it.
[16:20.25]No, why would I do that?
[16:23.13]Fire Marshal Bill.
[16:25.63]And there's another one here too.
[16:27.77]Look at that.
[16:35.06]It's just beautiful.
[16:41.78]But why is he so sad?
[16:43.86]What happened?
[16:45.82]Why is he so, what happened?
[16:49.92]Just crying because he's sad.
[16:53.68]This is a meme.
[16:56.84]Oh, because I sold them out.
[16:58.84]No, I didn't.
[16:59.36]Now this one in particular, for one second I was like, oh shit, there's somebody naked here, but it's alright.
[17:10.27]This was, this is a banner that was made for the whole Dremble Rumble.
[17:17.63]Pretty much over the years, I guess.
[17:19.59]It's awesome.
[17:22.48]We got Batboy up here.
[17:24.65]The Egg.
[17:25.77]Let's see if I know my own character universe.
[17:31.59]His, uh, wall dad.
[17:34.05]Super green screen.
[17:35.99]Charlie, uh, cheese nips.
[17:37.93]Pac-Man.
[17:39.10]30s Milkman.
[17:40.98]The Egg.
[17:42.66]Me.
[17:43.48]Batboy.
[17:44.14]Demon Lord Daraxos.
[17:45.44]Sonic the Pencil.
[17:47.30]Uh, Captain Cheez-It.
[17:51.22]Right?
[17:53.67]Oh, fuck, who's that?
[17:55.67]Salad Fingers?
[17:57.71]No.
[17:58.65]Did I put Salad Fingers in a rumble?
[18:02.94]Oh, Frogman from Dark Souls.
[18:04.30]Frogman from Dark Souls, right?
[18:06.12]Frogman.
[18:06.58]That's Super Jex.
[18:08.42]There's the VR guy.
[18:09.62]A little bit of background here.
[18:13.38]VR guy is my, probably like top three favorite characters I've ever made in a video game.
[18:19.30]That whole thing.
[18:20.22]The whole thing just was perfect for me.
[18:21.80]I loved every second of it.
[18:22.68]That's VR guy.
[18:24.28]Garfield.
[18:25.33]Miserable Mikey.
[18:27.17]Dr. Roker.
[18:28.71]Dr. Roker's pizza.
[18:29.63]Haven't eaten one.
[18:33.21]VR.
[18:33.71]Why VR guy?
[18:36.65]Because he was on a wireless VR headset.
[18:39.43]And just was playing a VR game.
[18:41.56]And didn't know he was in a wrestling event.
[18:44.46]That's my favorite character.
[18:45.50]Are you making fun of my favorite character?
[18:50.77]Uh, there's Grandpa, obviously.
[18:51.81]There's me again.
[18:52.95]This is, look at how deep, I love, I love the, alright, here we go.
[18:58.31]I don't know shit about art, but here we go.
[19:00.37]I like the smoothness.
[19:04.73]I like the, the almost, um, I love the smoothness of the palette.
[19:11.75]What am I trying to say here?
[19:12.45]I love the, it's like sanded almost.
[19:15.94]It's like sanded wood.
[19:17.96]I love the sanded wood look here.
[19:20.97]Take a look at Acetamine.
[19:23.03]It looks great.
[19:24.95]So we got Glue Man.
[19:29.29]Mr. Sneak Man.
[19:29.94]Everybody has a man.
[19:31.84]Everyone's man or boy.
[19:33.00]I'm coming to that realization right now.
[19:37.50]This is Bia... Bia... Bia 38, by the way.
[19:42.74]Don't think I know my own characters.
[19:43.76]That's Bia 38.
[19:45.96]Dick Dastley Richard.
[19:48.52]Oh, fuck.
[19:48.98]I don't know his name.
[19:51.69]Chuck Schnoz, right?
[19:57.28]Chuck Schnozwell, that's the one.
[20:04.10]And that's the bottom half of the two-person horse.
[20:05.91]I got it.
[20:06.31]And we had 10 community subs just come in from Soft33.
[20:08.43]Thank you.
[20:12.22]SoftThreads, we appreciate that.

[20:15.12]Congratulations to those who got them.
[20:16.97]And thank you for the giant sub drop.
[20:19.17]Really.
[20:19.49]Thanks a lot.
[20:20.41]Forgot Frogman.
[20:21.15]Well, I don't... I just... It's been a while.
[20:25.51]This is fantastic, though.
[20:28.59]This is awesome.
[20:29.17]And then there's another one right after this one.
[20:32.83]I remember this one.
[20:33.71]I did... I've shown a couple of these already on stream.
[20:36.92]But... Jesus.
[20:39.26]Some of these are so fucking good.
[20:40.58]You have to just look at them again.
[20:47.21]You nailed it.
[20:50.13]It's a police sketch.
[20:51.65]That's the best damn police sketch I've ever seen in my life.
[21:01.48]No, this is great.
[21:06.00]I love the... It almost looks like it was... You know what I'm saying?
[21:13.51]You did the whole thing and then it was like,
[21:17.40]Whatever that's called.
[21:22.47]I love the smoothness of it.
[21:27.11]It's dope.
[21:27.51]I mean, you know what I'm saying?
[21:28.73]I love the tapping of it.
[21:31.27]I love the tapped, smeared, tapped on the cheeks.
[21:35.11]You know what I'm saying?
[21:37.29]Like, see here?
[21:38.27]It's like a... I know exactly how your hand moved when you did this, by the way.
[21:42.62]You went like this.
[21:44.08]Like, here's the paper.
[21:45.40]You went like...
[21:47.32]Like... No.
[21:55.13]What are you talking about?
[22:01.39]This is pencil.
[22:05.14]I know.
[22:06.22]But after the pencil was done, you went there with like a cloth and you went like... It's fucking fantastic.
[22:15.18]It seriously is.
[22:15.73]Thank you for this.
[22:18.48]And that's V as Spider-Man.
[22:23.89]The Simpsons.
[22:26.05]What the fuck?
[22:29.95]It's like Peter Parker.
[22:32.11]My brain is fucking fried apparently.
[22:36.25]I don't know why that was instantly, that was instantly Peter Parker.
[22:44.60]They both start with an S. That's the problem.
[22:49.15]Spider-Man Simpsons.
[22:52.39]Peter Parker.
[22:54.99]Thanks for drawing me as Peter Parker.
[22:58.19]No, this is great too.
[23:02.69]I have no idea why that came out.
[23:05.12]Seriously.
[23:06.04]By the way, this outfit.
[23:07.74]I love it.
[23:08.38]I love the gray.
[23:10.14]Gray?
[23:11.42]I'm going to give you, look, those of you guys that are like, oh, I need some fashion sense.
[23:15.79]Help me.
[23:16.67]Well, I can't help you up here because this is obviously like a joke, right?
[23:19.89]But for here, gray, gray, black, blue, gray, black, blue, gray top, black jeans, blue sneakers, black top, gray jeans, blue sneakers, blue top, black jeans, gray sneakers.

[23:44.53]Black pants.
[23:46.11]Black shirt.
[23:46.85]Black pants.
[23:47.95]Black shoes.
[23:49.81]Navy blue shirt.
[23:50.93]Navy blue shoes.
[23:52.55]Gray pants.
[23:59.66]Gray shows sweat.
[24:03.10]They all do, okay?
[24:07.48]We're all humans.
[24:09.38]That's boring.
[24:11.86]No, it's stylish and it's classic.
[24:14.89]Guys, it's classic.
[24:17.63]If... If you have... They're timeless for a reason.
[24:26.06]This is called... This is called when chat is bored, I think.
[24:31.74]Too many jupes.
[24:38.69]There it comes.
[24:39.49]Can we get one?
[24:40.39]I want one completed one.
[24:41.63]I want a real completed one or I'm not moving on.
[24:45.35]I will sit here until... There we go.
[24:46.63]Somebody got it.
[24:47.01]They got it.
[24:47.78]Good.
[24:48.08]You got... Wow.
[24:48.80]Holy shit.
[24:49.14]You guys did it very easily.
[24:52.82]That's... I'm surprised you did it that quickly.
[24:56.32]It's too many dupes.
[24:58.96]Too many dupes.
[24:59.72]That's what we're seeing right now in chat.
[25:04.22]Stream will be bopping.
[25:08.43]Remember that one.
[25:10.07]This is great This one's really good.
[25:17.86]Yeah, they're all really good.
[25:20.54]But, yeah, this is fantastic.
[25:22.64]This is from the game that... I can't even tell you the title.
[25:27.05]I don't know what it is.
[25:27.83]It's something about, like, existence... Existence is futile, or whatever.
[25:33.01]Resistance is futile.
[25:34.53]That's the Borg from Star Trek.
[25:37.57]It's something like that.
[25:39.53]You'll find it.
[25:41.45]Type in the word, like, existence into the Steam bar, and, like, it'll probably pop up.
[25:47.30]It's a weed game.
[25:48.44]Whatever you want to call it.
[25:49.77]But this is great.
[25:50.41]This is the very beginning of the game.
[25:51.37]That's the best part of the whole game.
[25:59.15]What's boppin'?
[26:01.01]What's boppin', gamer?
[26:02.25]Yeah, that's true.
[26:05.15]What else we got here?
[26:06.45]But that's great.
[26:06.95]Thank you.
[26:08.35]Oh, shit.
[26:08.73]We're zoomed in.
[26:09.45]But this one's got one of our favorite characters.
[26:13.71]That's an iced coffee.
[26:16.23]That's Fireman enjoying an iced coffee while a rat cooks a marshmallow on his head.
[26:22.89]I mean, this is, like, come on, this is genius.
[26:27.91]And I think they're in the desert.
[26:29.74]So this is probably somewhere in Las Vegas.
[26:34.86]Hot chocolate.
[26:38.66]Oh, it is a hot chocolate.
[26:39.54]I thought it was an iced coffee.
[26:40.72]Alright, that's my headcanon.
[26:44.86]That's an iced coffee.
[26:46.31]Because he's like Fireman.
[26:47.37]He's got to like cool down with an iced coffee.
[26:51.49]I thought that was ice.
[26:52.39]Like ice coffee.
[26:53.01]Alright, whatever.
[26:53.39]But this is... I love it.
[26:56.39]I love the rat.
[26:57.93]I love the marshmallow.
[27:00.33]He needs to heat it up.
[27:03.55]He would die if he drank this.
[27:05.40]No, he wouldn't.
[27:08.48]Why would he... Why would he die if he drank this?
[27:12.70]This is not going to kill him.
[27:14.00]Why would this kill him?
[27:15.10]Because it's cold?
[27:21.85]It's too cold.
[27:25.95]Guys, if there's a fire blazing... Like, if you have a fire blazing and you pour a water on it, you're not going to put the fire out.
[27:34.59]It's going to be like... And then just come back.
[27:36.93]You're not going to put the whole thing out.
[27:40.81]If you have a big fucking fire in front of you and you take a cup of water this big and you go like this, it's going to go... And it's not going to put it out.
[27:51.41]You need a bucket of... If this was a bucket of iced coffee, then maybe.
[27:54.34]I would be concerned.
[27:58.80]Do it.
[28:03.44]Especially, you know, he might be made out of grease.
[28:07.02]So that would just make it worse.
[28:09.52]If this was a cup of, like, powder... How do you get rid of a grease fire?
[28:13.80]It's powder, right?
[28:15.92]Yeah, if this was a cup of, like, talcum powder, get it away from him.
[28:24.16]sand yeah that's yep cover it don't go near him don't cover him with anything you use milk now this is great though thank you uh this also is uh strangely strangely in like the same spot somehow
[28:46.33]This says, it's so the courier who had cheated death in the cemetery outside Goodsprings cheated death once again.
[28:52.19]And the Mojave wasteland was forever changed.
[28:58.15]That was Odd Michael's trip to Vegas.
[29:03.93]This is pretty good.
[29:05.69]Is this a spoiler?
[29:07.24]Spoiler for what?
[29:12.10]Wait, is this the end of the game?
[29:16.96]This is the game's intro.
[29:26.99]No, it's not?
[29:27.65]Is this the outro?
[29:28.85]Is this the game's outro?
[29:32.50]Uh-oh.
[29:34.58]The game's been out for 15 years.
[29:36.58]If you didn't play it yet, you're not going to play it.
[29:39.48]And by the way, why have you not played it?
[29:41.80]It's the best one.
[29:45.51]It's the first portion of the outro.
[29:48.17]Let's skip that one then.
[29:52.30]This is on the Odd Michael theme.
[29:58.76]You know what I really like on this one?
[30:01.06]I like the pixelated graphics.
[30:05.06]Each beard is a pixel line.
[30:09.12]I like it.
[30:11.30]You got the edges here, very pixelated.
[30:15.77]Nice teeth.
[30:18.75]I like the beard.
[30:19.67]The beard really draws you in.
[30:21.81]When you look at this, what's the first thing you look at?
[30:24.49]You look, bang, right at that beard.
[30:26.99]This right here.
[30:30.64]I haven't shaved, so... This still works.
[30:36.54]Looking good.
[30:38.40]Thank you for the, uh... And we got the pretzel here, too.
[30:41.72]That's what I like the most.
[30:43.42]Same artist, I believe.
[30:44.78]This is Jex.
[30:45.66]I don't have that much hair, though.
[30:50.76]No, I did.
[30:51.52]I did have this much hair.
[30:53.26]I forgot.
[30:54.02]Do you guys remember, like, two or three years ago, how fucking long this was?
[30:59.95]It came down to, like, here.
[31:02.59]It was crazy.
[31:04.76]But it wasn't nice long.
[31:06.74]It was just gross long.
[31:08.62]It was ugly.
[31:10.46]It was just long into here.
[31:13.17]It didn't have it layered, so it was just weird looking.
[31:15.37]Now my hair is a mustache.
[31:22.07]That's fine.
[31:23.30]I'd probably rather have a mustache here.
[31:24.68]But this is great.
[31:25.60]It's got the glasses, too.
[31:30.34]What the heck are you talking about, old man?
[31:31.62]You've been bald for 30 years.
[31:32.96]I haven't even been alive for 30 years.
[31:37.14]But that's Jex, and this was Odd Michael.
[31:41.74]Good shit.
[31:47.63]This is me.
[31:48.27]I did this one.
[31:54.87]Oh, right, there's a part two.
[31:58.17]I have no idea what I was doing here.
[32:00.96]I can't, I don't know.
[32:02.20]This was supposed to be what?
[32:04.17]This was Twitch, right?
[32:07.13]And then... This is a streamer.
[32:11.59]Oh, right.
[32:12.13]This is from a couple weeks ago.
[32:14.67]So this is me drawing a streamer.
[32:19.16]This is... Gerber is my favorite finger YouTuber.
[32:24.20]What do you do?
[32:24.64]Just go like this?
[32:27.54]hey what's going on guys welcome back uh welcome back to uh hands episode of 415. yep that's the one I'm gonna go like this today okay oh what would that even mean hand just just I'm a finger I'm a YouTuber that just finger hand YouTuber
[32:55.22]He's still got it.
[32:56.30]He's still got it.
[32:58.08]Yeah, guys, I don't know.
[32:59.20]I'm really like trying to think about a change here.
[33:01.84]I've been a finger YouTuber for like the last six years and I kind of want to move on.
[33:08.41]I want to move forward.
[33:09.33]I want to keep the content going.
[33:11.66]So I'm thinking of transitioning into Elbow.
[33:13.76]You know?
[33:14.28]I know, I know, I'm looking at the comments right now.
[33:16.96]No, you used to be so much fucking cooler when you were a hand YouTuber.
[33:19.88]But no, I don't want an Elbow.
[33:21.70]No, I don't want that.
[33:23.06]God, I'm just trying to do something different now.
[33:24.64]You know what I mean?
[33:26.44]You guys cool?
[33:30.44]I know, people, it's gonna take a while.
[33:32.26]Maybe just give it like 10 or 12 episodes.
[33:35.14]Look, I'll do, here, how about this?
[33:37.66]Once a week, I'll do a hand and a finger YouTube video, but I'm really into this right now.
[33:52.04]Anyways, the next image is a continuation of this.
[33:55.52]I believe they drew this.
[33:59.14]They interpreted that.
[34:02.69]Okay.
[34:08.36]Is this supposed to be me?
[34:14.29]No, why am I being, like, obeyed?
[34:24.41]It's me watching your stream.
[34:27.92]Vessel, right, right, right, right.
[34:29.92]Let's take a look, see how accurate it is.
[34:34.38]Pretty, pretty accurate.
[34:42.12]This is the fucking thing you hang up on the fridge.
[34:45.90]That your three-year-old drew.
[34:50.28]This is not streamer.
[34:51.92]This is, how was your first day of the first grade?
[34:56.24]Well, Mr. Stevenson is really nice.
[35:00.43]And we got to go to computers.
[35:02.73]And he turned on all the computers for us.
[35:05.85]And I played Minecraft.
[35:11.58]Oh, wow.
[35:12.86]Wait, wait.
[35:13.76]Your teacher's letting you play video games in school?
[35:17.84]Yeah, I played Minecraft for 10, 20 minutes.
[35:22.25]I'm going to be writing a letter to that fucking superintendent.
[35:27.67]But no, this is great.
[35:28.29]Thank you.
[35:31.79]Pull him out of that school.
[35:35.99]No, they should be teaching children about...
[35:43.36]What should they be teaching kids now?
[35:45.94]What do they teach?
[35:46.62]What's in school now?
[35:48.30]I haven't been in school in a long time.
[35:50.28]What's the first class you take in middle school?
[36:00.43]Stocks.
[36:01.05]No, they don't.
[36:02.75]I would have signed up for that class in high school.
[36:06.83]Science.
[36:10.42]Taxes.
[36:10.92]They don't teach you how to do taxes.
[36:13.27]You want to talk about how fucking strange the American educational system is?
[36:18.05]We have this thing that everybody has to fucking do when they get older.
[36:22.75]When you get to be 14, 15, 16, 17 years old, why are they not teaching us how the tax system works?
[36:32.98]Because you just get a job afterwards, and then you just are supposed to know.
[36:39.08]Who fucking is supposed to tell you these things?
[36:45.79]It would have been really nice to know how the credit system worked.
[36:52.27]But Christopher Columbus, they drove his boat and found this.
[37:00.27]Okay, how do, what does credit mean?
[37:02.87]And please help me.
[37:10.15]I didn't know what credit fucking was until I was like, I didn't understand how the system worked until I was like 26.
[37:16.50]And I would imagine that a lot of you guys still don't fucking know.
[37:29.88]Exactly.
[37:30.26]That's what I'm saying.
[37:31.14]Why is this not like a subject to teach us skills?
[37:33.76]Give us like skills that we need.
[37:35.30]Give us life skills.
[37:39.23]Roll the TV in and show the Christopher Columbus shit on the TV.
[37:44.01]We'll be way more involved in that one.
[37:53.66]There's gotta be, like, an old, like, Magic School Bus episode about Christopher Columbus.
[37:58.10]That's 22 minutes long.
[37:59.88]That's not, like, eight days worth of reading textbooks.
[38:07.02]Teach me how to do my taxes!
[38:09.90]Teach me how to live.
[38:17.96]Does a magic school bus have like a taxes episode?
[38:25.53]That'd be pretty fucking funny if they did.
[38:28.41]Anyways, sorry.
[38:31.41]I just want our education.
[38:34.13]I want our education system to be working.
[38:41.82]Jerma985 in Cox Cowboy, the slowest upload in the West.
[38:52.51]What is this?
[38:56.11]What is that?
[39:00.70]Is that a broom?
[39:02.42]Am I holding like a broom up?
[39:05.28]Okay, at Hot Topic they sell those lamps that are like that, right?
[39:08.74]Is that a lamp?
[39:16.83]It's a horse.
[39:17.97]Where's the horse?
[39:22.53]And who like shaved it?
[39:25.03]Because there's a large chunk missing here.
[39:41.66]Is this the tail?
[39:42.64]Is this the horse's tail?
[39:44.66]And like the horse is like out here.
[39:56.80]That's the horse's mane.
[40:01.23]What is this?
[40:03.19]That looks like a bar.
[40:23.50]Sometimes it's too easy.
[40:26.70]This is great, this is glue man.
[40:35.61]Got ya.
[40:38.23]Please stop, people are gonna actually think that you're dumb.
[40:46.72]This is why, if only they fucking taught us in school
[40:56.34]zoology I would have been able to know immediately what the that was don't blame me blame the educational system that I was taught which was algebra two part two
[41:17.66]I don't remember a goddamn thing from Algebra 2 Part 2.
[41:21.38]Not a thing.
[41:22.22]I don't even know.
[41:23.82]I'm going to close my eyes.
[41:24.54]I'm going to try to think of one word that came out in that class.
[41:27.79]I can't.
[41:36.63]Imaginary numbers.
[41:41.15]Look, math is important, right?
[41:44.30]I don't buy the whole thing that they used to sell us in those classes.
[41:49.54]You don't think you're gonna use it, but you will, Yvette.
[41:52.17]You're gonna use it.
[41:53.23]You don't know you will, but you will.
[41:56.81]Yeah?
[41:57.67]When?
[42:00.81]When have I ever done, like, X parentheses, two plus three brackets?
[42:05.91]No, we have Excel for that, Mrs. Stevenson.
[42:15.98]This is Greg Luman, by the way.
[42:24.31]Like, this is perfect.
[42:26.91]I don't know why I thought that said style, Seinfeld.
[42:29.09]I was like, wow, he fucking nailed it.
[42:31.26]There's a Seinfeld style in Soul Calibur?
[42:36.40]That's pretty cool.
[42:37.26]What does it do?
[42:42.48]And I mean, like, this could be like a Seinfeld thing.
[42:46.77]that's like a kramer move or something I don't know oh hey we've seen these before I just uh that was like so that was such a stretch like oh yeah kramer remember when he walked in and he goes like he does that though that's okay that's not a stretch
[43:18.66]That's not a stretch.
[43:19.54]He does that shit.
[43:20.28]He, like, opened the doors and he, like... He would, like, fucking move his hands around and be like, Jerry!
[43:30.53]But this is from Yen Wen.
[43:31.29]This is some great stuff from Yen Wen.
[43:34.97]Look at me, Jerry, look at me.
[43:36.23]I think this is the first one that Yen Wen ever, I think, at least on stream...
[43:48.42]So I can't even, man.
[43:50.52]But yes, it's fucking fantastic.
[43:52.66]Yen Wen is incredibly talented, as you'll see here.
[43:55.30]This is one of my favorites.
[43:59.04]This is the seagull one.
[44:06.40]It's so good.
[44:07.42]It's so detailed.
[44:11.28]It looks nice.
[44:12.30]Yeah, I'll tell you.
[44:14.53]Up here.
[44:16.32]See, up here, the effect that the wings are flapping is done, it's achieved by, like, you take the palette and you take a little bit of a cloth and you, like, dip it in some water and you go to blur it out.
[44:33.93]The blurred image is representing movement because if you take a photo, if you take a picture of this happening,
[44:41.81]The frame rate would not be fast enough.
[44:43.57]Your ISO would need to be closed.
[44:48.24]Or opened.
[44:49.26]Depending on your shutter speed has to do with it too.
[44:52.56]This is like a great family photo.
[45:00.12]Of course.
[45:00.80]Stocks are crashing.
[45:02.68]Like in real life?
[45:03.15]Alright.
[45:15.03]just imagine like the dow drops like 10 000 points someone just comes into Twitch chat and just goes alright what happened oh well time to buy gold this is also from yen win
[45:44.39]This is, uh, before the carnival happened.
[45:48.61]Get yourself, get a... Unfortunately, I was not the clown in that stream.
[46:00.11]That's, no, that is not a penis.
[46:04.85]That's a dog.
[46:06.79]Or...
[46:13.49]I don't know how to make a dog, so that's pretty accurate.
[46:17.62]This is me trying to make a dog.
[46:19.56]Look at that intense face, though.
[46:21.00]Like, painted on eyebrows.
[46:29.19]I should ask Polly Polite.
[46:31.25]See if she can help me here.
[46:35.20]But they're all... I picked out a few of my favorites there, so... They're all... Ah!
[46:39.78]Damn it.
[46:40.06]You ever... That ever happen?
[46:41.56]You ever get, like, stuck?
[46:42.93]And you have to, like... That's been happening a lot lately.
[46:45.77]What's fucking wrong with me?
[46:49.95]Me with the rats?
[46:55.10]It happens.
[46:55.48]Sometimes you just get, like, a little kink.
[46:58.66]Uh, it's just... Me hanging out with my rat friends.
[47:04.55]Go see a chiropractor.
[47:06.05]I've actually been told that before.
[47:11.32]But chiropractors are weird because 50% of all people say chiropractors are horseshit and they're fake and it's like going and getting a psychic reading.
[47:24.04]And then 50% of people will tell you I went to a chiropractor and it changed my life.
[47:31.88]So...
[47:34.82]Who do I fucking believe?
[47:47.14]I guess some people can go to a psychic reading and that can change your life too because they're like, oh, you have money coming in the future and you're like, holy shit, that was awesome.
[47:59.11]I guess that makes sense.
[48:02.24]I don't know.
[48:03.54]It scares the shit out of me too.
[48:04.58]I don't know.
[48:04.86]I feel like, okay, like lie down here and just put your back that way.
[48:08.59]Okay.
[48:08.81]Now I'm going to turn your body like this and then I'm going to put my knee into your back and pull as hard as I can this way and snap the other way with my knee and like break your back.
[48:19.66]Right.
[48:22.20]And then they like, I've seen like, I've seen videos of people that they put them like in this like device.
[48:29.07]They like lock their head like this.
[48:31.49]And then the guy takes like a thing and like puts it around their head and like pulls it up.
[48:36.72]Like.
[48:36.92]And every time I see one of those videos, I just go, I don't want to fucking do that.
[48:45.24]But then somebody will tell me.
[48:47.97]Man, you gotta go.
[48:50.09]You gotta go.
[48:50.69]I'm telling you.
[48:51.23]I feel like my spine's got fluid in it now.
[48:56.03]I'm not gonna go.
[48:57.85]I don't want to have that thing put around my head.
[48:59.70]It's gonna be like medieval torture device.
[49:04.40]But this is great.
[49:05.94]Me and the rat friends.
[49:09.72]That's Fireman.
[49:12.14]He's got underwear on.
[49:13.30]Relax.
[49:14.21]This is Super Fireman.
[49:18.42]As you can see.
[49:20.12]Powered up.
[49:22.86]Or in mid-powering, possibly.
[49:27.22]Good lord.
[49:27.84]Yeah, I wonder how many iced coffees it would take to put this one out.
[49:35.39]Right, guys?
[49:37.25]God.
[49:39.77]And then from the same artist.
[49:42.35]This is Dick Dastley Richard.
[49:50.84]I like this a lot.
[49:52.86]I like the bag.
[49:55.80]I like the eye slots.
[49:59.12]It makes it look more like a mask.
[50:03.06]It's a hand tuber.
[50:03.96]Yep.
[50:05.02]Contemplating getting into the hand tuber scene.
[50:12.65]Did you paint?
[50:13.17]Did you do that?
[50:14.03]That looks... This is really cool.
[50:18.35]Did you take the media from the game?
[50:24.15]and just kind of layer it on here and then go over like around it that's pretty cool because this is this looks like the the game media that's exactly what I did nice that's awesome and if not then you came really really really almost scarily close to what it actually looks like very very cool this is uh from the computer doctor stream
[50:55.00]So it reminds me of, like, a Sunday morning cartoon panel.
[51:00.44]Gold-plated hip.
[51:05.57]I feel like this should be, like, a bubble here.
[51:07.89]And this is, like, panel three or something.
[51:11.61]You gotta make a statement.
[51:12.51]You do have to make a statement with your computers.
[51:17.22]Looking for Garfield.
[51:21.28]Looks like Kramer.
[51:24.22]And I'm doing a Kramer right here.
[51:32.95]That's Kramer.
[51:38.53]Do I look like Kramer?
[51:40.61]Maybe.
[51:42.16]Maybe a little.
[51:44.64]No, I don't think so.
[51:46.70]Kinda.
[51:47.12]No, I don't think so.
[51:49.86]A little.
[51:50.92]Not really.
[51:54.07]Oh, this is an animation.
[51:55.98]This person said that they were working on an animation.
[51:58.18]It's the first time they've ever animated anything.
[52:00.96]And they have a little template that they were working on for... This is a pre-Carnival stuff.
[52:06.26]And this is just a little bit of a teaser for what might come later.
[52:12.13]And we have a little bit of a look here.
[52:14.85]They were going to do what I assumed was going to be a Carnival cartoon.
[52:19.37]With all these little ideas.
[52:21.56]It just looked cool, so...
[52:24.40]I wanted to look at it.
[52:25.06]I wanted to show it.
[52:28.22]What's that called?
[52:31.14]So you guys got to help me out here because I don't know anything about art.
[52:33.22]What is the thing called when you draw?
[52:36.70]Let's say you're going to draw something.
[52:38.34]And then the first thing you draw is like all the lines.
[52:41.78]Like lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines.
[52:44.48]And then over, what is that like called when you do that line work rough sketch?
[52:52.47]Does it have anything?
[52:53.23]Is it called anything?
[52:59.18]Like a rough sketch.
[52:59.96]Because then you go over it, right?
[53:02.14]Are we dropping frames?
[53:04.34]No.
[53:04.76]We're okay.
[53:07.10]Because then you go over that and then you delete the layer behind it.
[53:12.81]Construction lines.
[53:15.37]Early access art.
[53:17.67]There's like six different terms for it.
[53:22.45]Structured lines.
[53:23.47]Okay.
[53:23.67]Okay.
[53:25.31]Yeah, I always found that interesting, because it's almost like you... You're, like, building out a skeleton, and then you go over the skeleton, and then you delete the skeleton.
[53:32.97]And you keep adding, and then you maybe delete that, too.
[53:37.39]It's a DLC sketch.
[53:40.37]This is cool, though.
[53:41.05]Really cool stuff.
[53:41.73]And that's just me, you know.
[53:47.12]That's just me just looking great.
[53:54.81]Try it?
[53:56.07]I can't do it.
[54:00.52]Delete your skeleton, yeah.
[54:05.54]I think you got it pretty good.
[54:06.60]I think you got it pretty close.
[54:08.98]I said my hair's a little longer now, but maybe not before.
[54:14.68]This is Jerma Chad.
[54:17.97]That's just, that's just Jerma Jerma.
[54:24.40]Nice work.
[54:26.97]Here's some dunky donuts because you're epic.
[54:30.23]I don't know.
[54:31.01]I still don't understand this.
[54:33.29]Did this come from this channel?
[54:37.11]It gets blurry.
[54:41.22]No.
[54:41.86]Okay.
[54:42.60]So this is not... The Dunkin' Donuts thing.
[54:49.84]Here's some dunky donut because you're epic.
[55:02.95]The little rat is great.
[55:05.13]And I got the Twitch logo on it.
[55:07.95]I feel like this is something you would do out of Starbucks.
[55:12.13]If you were like really, really pretentious about your stream.
[55:16.65]And what's the name?
[55:18.51]twitch.tv/Jerma985.
[55:19.73]Okay.
[55:20.03]And they have to write it on there.
[55:25.53]And then you can walk around with it and people can just see it.
[55:28.22]I don't know.
[55:31.61]People probably do that.
[55:32.75]Phylactery Lich just gave 5,000 bits.
[55:35.33]50 bucks from Phylactery.
[55:40.57]Phylactery, a lot of money.
[55:43.79]They're the money king at this point.
[55:46.65]And they say this.
[55:47.91]Hey, Jerma, quick question.
[55:48.77]Do you find it weird that right now your bones are wet?
[55:55.68]No, not at all.
[55:57.12]Because the bones are just the thing to protect a little bit of meat inside.
[56:00.46]That's fine.
[56:01.46]The bones are the shield for the marrow that's inside of them.
[56:04.68]I don't care.
[56:09.08]Do you care when your car gets wet?
[56:12.00]No, the car is the shell protecting the meat inside, which is you.
[56:26.50]I just saw somebody just wrote, he's insane.
[56:31.62]No, your bones... What do you mean wet?
[56:35.90]How are they wet?
[56:36.84]Okay, you've got skin.
[56:39.68]Muscle.
[56:44.59]Bone.
[56:45.01]But what, is muscle wet?
[56:47.85]I mean, it's maybe damp, like moist damp.
[56:52.01]Muscles are not like... They're damp.
[56:55.05]They're like liquidy, I guess.
[56:58.00]But who cares?
[57:00.28]Because if we weren't like 76% water, then that's fine.
[57:06.81]That's the actual question.
[57:08.59]Is it weird that you are 76% water?
[57:10.69]I guess, probably.
[57:14.94]But guess what, guys?
[57:16.48]You want to talk about some weird, fucked up, next level meta shit?
[57:20.50]So is the Earth.
[57:21.12]Weird.
[57:23.50]Weird.
[57:33.37]This is from the Hit and Run streams.
[57:40.75]Bogdanoffs are calling.
[57:44.73]It's from the Hit and Run The Simpsons stream.
[57:46.57]This is from the Spider-Man stream.
[57:49.35]If you remember when we played Spider-Man.
[57:53.25]I did.
[57:53.59]It was very, very good.
[57:54.93]It's an interesting depiction.
[57:59.86]You know, Dark Octopus.
[58:05.58]That was two years ago.
[58:07.00]Was it?
[58:12.94]No, it was not.
[58:15.48]That was in... No, that was in Vegas.
[58:17.67]I've only been in Vegas for a year.
[58:20.71]That was like six or seven months ago.
[58:25.03]That was like three or four months ago.
[58:26.53]That was not that long ago.
[58:28.66]It was two years ago.
[58:29.72]This is great.
[58:31.25]I think this actually was the thumbnail for that second Jerma video that was made, I think.
[58:40.57]It was in December.
[58:42.42]Right.
[58:44.22]He's trying to figure out his own lore.
[58:48.32]Right, but to be fair, I have an encyclopedia this thick of stuff that I've ever said or done on camera.
[58:57.32]And sometimes you gotta cycle to, like, the S for Simpsons.
[59:01.59]Okay, there it is.
[59:04.59]Thick, okay.
[59:06.67]This is, uh, Glue Man.
[59:09.05]And, uh, me.
[59:13.29]This is great, I love this.
[59:19.07]Okay, much taller than Glue Man, as you see.
[59:22.63]We have seen this before, but it's worth showing again.
[59:26.65]This is the old Jerma.
[59:28.29]New Jerma shrunk and became... I'm still alright.
[59:36.08]I'm not going to give you guys any gasoline to dump on that fire.
[59:39.96]Yeah.
[59:41.70]But we've seen this one before.
[59:43.24]It's really good shit.
[59:44.94]I think these are all made by the same artist, these two.
[59:46.74]This one as well.
[59:48.72]Yeah, I believe so.
[59:50.60]Very, very good work.
[59:52.75]I like the background here.
[59:55.28]It makes the foreground pop.
[60:00.62]Did you guys know that I was... I swear to God, this is not a lie.
[60:03.02]This is 100% true.
[60:03.98]I promise you.
[60:04.76]I fucking 100% promise.
[60:08.18]I was an art minor in college with my degree.
[60:12.86]My degree is an art minor.
[60:17.78]Yeah.
[60:19.24]Yes, that's true.
[60:20.64]It is.
[60:26.65]I need to show you.
[60:27.45]I don't even know where my degree is.
[60:28.83]I don't think it's even in this house.
[60:36.66]I don't have my degree.
[60:38.72]If I ever needed to prove, this is the funniest part, if I ever like applied for a job somewhere and they were like, oh, can we like see a copy of your degree?
[60:45.20]I don't fucking have it.
[60:49.00]Can I like call the, can you call the college?
[60:52.17]Is it like sending you medical documents?
[60:54.71]Hey, I need you to fax my medical degree, my documents over.
[60:58.85]You can do that, right?
[61:00.07]Is there like a timeline where you can't do that anymore?
[61:03.27]What if I graduated 20 years ago?
[61:05.35]Do they still have it?
[61:12.03]What if the college... Okay, what if the college goes under and doesn't exist anymore?
[61:21.10]Where can I get it?
[61:24.16]I should get it now then.
[61:25.77]I'm gonna get like five copies of it.
[61:27.25]Hey, can you send over five copies of my degree?
[61:31.97]Just in case.
[61:36.93]You're screwed.
[61:39.65]No, I'll be fine.
[61:43.89]Back to college I go.
[61:50.58]The state government should have it, too.
[61:52.20]They have?
[61:52.76]The state government has everybody's degrees?
[61:58.82]What was your major?
[62:00.18]Engineering.
[62:04.96]Oh, look at this one!
[62:08.08]This is a cute picture of me and Kim.
[62:13.11]If you don't know, Kim is my girlfriend.
[62:14.53]For those of you that might be new, you might not know.
[62:17.71]And that's me.
[62:20.64]It's adorable.
[62:23.74]I'm gonna hang this one up.
[62:25.96]I'm gonna hang them all up.
[62:27.80]I'm gonna get them as bumper stickers on my car.
[62:31.68]No, this is great.
[62:33.56]What I really like here... I'm not gonna say it.
[62:41.48]No, this is good shit.
[62:42.84]We've seen this on stream before, too.
[62:46.14]What do you mean, egomaniac?
[62:50.54]Hold on.
[62:51.80]I'm an egomaniac?
[62:55.99]What if somebody took a photo of you and your girlfriend?
[63:01.33]And they showed it to you.
[63:03.90]And then you're looking at it.
[63:04.68]Would somebody come over and say that you're an egomaniac?
[63:13.55]Holy shit, dude.
[63:14.21]Wait, you took like three... Wait, hold on a minute.
[63:16.27]You went on vacation?
[63:18.01]And you have like 10, 20 photos of you on vacation?
[63:20.69]You fucking egomaniac.
[63:22.67]Who are those for?
[63:25.39]I don't know.
[63:25.79]Why does everybody take pictures?
[63:26.91]Why does everybody do anything?
[63:31.73]They're for me.
[63:36.71]If they were insane and had no concept of social standards...
[63:41.40]So me wanting to frame a photo like this is like put it in like the fridge or in the bedroom or something.
[63:47.40]This is like a nice moment.
[63:51.58]Now, egomaniac would be if I told you to edit this photo and up here write top fucking 500 streamer, wicked sick stream, really talented guy with an arrow pointing over here.
[64:05.67]Like I have you edit it and do that and put that in.
[64:10.64]Or I won't put it up.
[64:12.40]That's how you make the difference.
[64:23.14]Please, OP.
[64:24.12]Edit that, please.
[64:25.10]OP.
[64:26.82]OP.
[64:29.22]Oh, Original Poster, right?
[64:31.60]No, this is good stuff, though.
[64:32.38]Thank you.
[64:33.96]Let's keep going.
[64:39.73]Uh...
[64:47.65]I just played this.
[64:49.43]It was over on my other monitor.
[64:51.03]The video portion's coming up.
[64:52.29]You didn't hear it.
[64:54.19]I just played that accidentally.
[64:57.09]But the audio was muted.
[65:01.95]There's a video portion coming up here in a little bit.
[65:04.33]And that is the first one.
[65:08.01]Anyways, this is an artist's depiction of what that image looks like down here.
[65:22.18]frame this one no this is I I get this is a Halloween mask this is two steps away from bf Bugleberry it's October make 3d print this as a mask how much would that cost how much would it cost to have a company actually make me like a silicone like 3d printed like actual mask of this
[65:56.16]like a hundred and fifty thousand dollars I don't think so one is it what is it made out of is it made out of like silk 300 bucks we'll see maybe
[66:20.41]This is great though, thank you.
[66:22.49]It's good shit.
[66:24.13]This is from the Dragon Lair stream.
[66:27.99]Please save me.
[66:28.95]I think this is called Jerma Daphne.
[66:32.81]The cage is locked with the key.
[66:34.25]The dragon keeps it around his neck to slay the dragon.
[66:36.82]Use the magic sword.
[66:39.62]We saw this, I think, 150 times.
[66:52.63]Dragon's Lair.
[66:58.79]That was close to a meltdown stream, by the way.
[67:04.09]That was very close.
[67:05.37]I would say another 10% more frustration in that game.
[67:09.10]I may have lost my mind.
[67:12.64]It was close.
[67:16.84]It was a lot of fun, though.
[67:18.00]It was.
[67:19.45]But thank you for this.
[67:20.07]It's great.
[67:21.29]That's supposed to be me in the glass tube thing.
[67:26.94]Now this is Jex.
[67:29.98]And I believe this is who made it.
[67:33.59]This is my Namco light gun.
[67:41.48]I missed that.
[67:42.20]I should have signed it.
[67:43.84]I should have signed that and, like, cut the cord off, signed it, and put it up in my entryway.
[67:51.64]Just to, like, have, like, look at that piece of, like, history.
[67:55.05]Fucking egomaniac.
[68:00.51]This is Vinny, right?
[68:04.13]It's a little gif.
[68:05.11]It'd be padding.
[68:08.82]That's V-dub.
[68:11.33]Oh, okay.
[68:12.97]I'm sorry.
[68:13.67]I'm sorry.
[68:14.27]I'm sorry.
[68:18.55]One of these days, maybe they'll team up.
[68:22.57]I don't know, though.
[68:24.55]I can't determine when he's going to come out.
[68:27.25]Sometimes he just does.
[68:33.04]No, that's cute.
[68:33.66]Very cool.
[68:35.02]And then the next one is... I don't know the context on these.
[68:40.08]learn the difference it could save your life one day Vinny the Jerma well I'm like sweaty and he's cool he's really cool and I'm like sweaty and weird
[68:56.14]And then this is V-Dub and Jex.
[68:59.43]Eats veggies, is cool, and has a gun.
[69:02.73]Taller than Jerma.
[69:04.45]Jex.
[69:05.25]Totally better than Vinny at video games.
[69:07.65]So this V-Dub is better than Vinny.
[69:10.15]V-Dub vapes.
[69:12.60]And just very epic.
[69:18.08]So wait, so Jex is better than Jerma?
[69:21.80]Is that what we're coming to the conclusion of here?
[69:26.52]no no no no no no this is like it's like vegeta and goku you need both of them otherwise you're not going to be able to take down frieza give me a break this is not better or this is the this is the version of I have to be that I don't no no no no no
[69:56.00]I need them both.
[69:59.28]There was... What... What was the movie?
[70:03.21]What the fuck was the movie or TV show where the person's... All their, like, alter egos came out.
[70:09.35]They had to, like, um... No, it's, uh, the, um... No, not Face Off.
[70:15.83]What?
[70:16.17]Face Off is two guys' faces switched.
[70:19.13]Um... There's a Zelda game where this happens.
[70:22.15]Split.
[70:25.54]Split.
[70:27.32]No, no, no, no, no, different.
[70:30.86]Zelda, Zelda and the four Links.
[70:33.60]Right?
[70:33.82]Like, there's, like, Sleepy Link, and then there's, like, Comedy Link, and then there's, like, Angry Link, right?
[70:37.76]And they, like, split up.
[70:39.44]Does that happen?
[70:45.45]No, there's something else, too.
[70:48.01]It's not Snow White.
[70:49.57]The seven dwarves did not combine into, like, a mecha dwarf.
[70:54.01]No.
[70:55.61]Jimmy Neutron?
[71:02.73]Why would that be so?
[71:03.47]That's too specific.
[71:04.41]I didn't watch Jimmy Neutron enough to know that.
[71:10.53]It's the movie called Identity.
[71:13.77]The Power Rangers.
[71:17.52]Identity.
[71:21.94]Okay.
[71:25.20]That's from Teen Titans.
[71:28.16]No, okay, every major cartoon has probably done this.
[71:31.74]Every major syndicated cartoon television show has probably done the, you, through some weird scientific experiment, had like six personalities come out of you.
[71:45.66]It just depends on which one you want to name.
[71:47.16]This happens in The Muppets.
[71:53.04]No, it doesn't.
[71:54.24]Danny Phantom.
[72:00.28]To me, Danny Phantom, Episode 1 and Episode 100 are the same episode.
[72:07.10]What happened in Danny Phantom?
[72:09.30]What was the overarching story arc of Danny Phantom?
[72:15.65]Because I saw like five or six episodes of Danny Phantom, and they were all the same episode.
[72:20.63]I could not tell them apart.
[72:29.36]I do remember the theme song, because it was lit.
[72:34.68]Let me do it for you right now.
[72:36.94]If I remember... He's... He's gonna catch up on Danny Phantom.
[72:47.69]Gonna catch up on Danny Phantom.
[72:50.77]I remember fucking hearing that and just being like... Just pumped me the fuck up every time.
[73:00.61]Somebody get $50.
[73:00.95]Uh, it was Phylactery Lich again.
[73:06.80]5,000 more bits from... Uh, I just said Danny Phantom.
[73:16.36]Thank you, Danny Phantom, for the 5,000... My brain is fucked up today.
[73:21.35]Can I just be very clear?
[73:24.33]Uh, they say this is basically Jex.
[73:28.21]Uh, hold on.
[73:30.33]I cannot click it right now.
[73:31.63]We'll watch it in a minute.
[73:33.77]Because that's in my Streamlabs here and I have like a weird setup to try to capture everything.
[73:37.81]So we'll watch it.
[73:39.64]But not right this second.
[73:43.90]Cutting in line.
[73:45.62]Cutting in line with a video.
[73:47.72]No, no.
[73:48.24]That's not how it works.
[73:49.78]Don't worry.
[73:50.24]It's alright.
[73:51.66]Cutting in line.
[73:53.46]No.
[73:55.25]No.
[73:55.45]There ain't no Disney Fast Pass on this stream, alright?
[74:01.96]anyways uh let's keep going we I'll I'll don't know it's gonna don't worry we'll get it so that's fair enough yeah let's keep going this is uh the ring leader here Jerma from the carnival stream cotton candy
[74:27.15]The most terrifying aspect of that whole stream was the cotton candy machine.
[74:31.09]I think I talked about it before, but the thing was dangerous.
[74:36.10]And of all the things that were there, there were machines that were shooting softballs at me.
[74:43.50]And the thing that was the closest thing to me actually getting severely injured was the cotton candy machine.
[74:51.23]We watched the footage afterwards and we were like,
[74:56.99]That's dangerous!
[75:02.15]The frog.
[75:06.84]What about the frog?
[75:09.08]The frog is alright.
[75:09.80]The umbrella, yeah.
[75:13.34]Still have a... I still have a scar on this finger.
[75:17.78]That'll be my next finger YouTuber video.
[75:22.38]Hey, I got like a cut the other day.
[75:24.79]That'll be in all capitals.
[75:26.59]Big cut on finger.
[75:30.83]Healing really well.
[75:36.68]No, it didn't cut me, it pinched me.
[75:39.14]And it hurt.
[75:39.86]A lot.
[75:43.04]But this is great.
[75:44.30]This is, uh... I really wish I looked that good, because... Here's the thing about costumes.
[75:52.22]When you buy a costume...
[75:54.47]There's an 80% chance that it's going to be made out of a material that's closer to paper than actual clothing.
[76:03.27]So, that hat and that robe were... They were barely caught.
[76:09.56]That hat was barely a hat.
[76:10.54]I don't know why.
[76:11.96]It's just cheap, cheap, cheap shit material.
[76:21.52]Paper is actually clothing.
[76:25.56]I don't know why this can't make it normal clothes.
[76:31.55]Jerm of Venus.
[76:32.59]Oh, yeah.
[76:36.87]It wasn't a top hat.
[76:37.65]It was a brimmed sack.
[76:39.81]Perfect description.
[76:41.73]It was.
[76:42.17]It was a brimmed sack.
[76:47.65]And no matter what I did, I put my hand in there and I folded around like I was frosting a cake.
[76:53.11]I was trying to just make it so it was not so weird looking and so smushed looking.
[76:57.49]It just looked like it had run off by a fucking car.
[77:01.55]But this is fantastic.
[77:02.96]Thank you.
[77:07.48]Oh, this is one of the things that didn't make it into the activity stream.

[82:26.41]There's glue.
[82:28.70]Carnival at Castle Griffinstein.
[82:30.38]This is great.
[82:32.88]And then, uh... Egg?
[82:34.96]I think we already got egg down here, right?
[82:36.84]Oh, no, this isn't an egg.
[82:38.38]It's a speaker.
[82:40.76]Okay.
[82:43.52]He's proud of us.
[82:44.34]Yeah, you guys did a great job.
[82:45.98]You did a fantastic job.
[82:47.78]Of course I'm proud of you.
[82:51.62]There's Batboy, Demon Lord.
[82:52.92]I think we got all.

[83:10.98]Where's an egg?
[83:12.84]Find the egg.
[83:13.42]I don't see an egg.
[83:16.47]Egg.

[83:42.55]Then there's the banana trophy right there.
[83:44.99]And there's that.
[83:45.51]Nice.
[83:46.09]Good work.
[83:49.10]Very cool.
[83:50.02]This is great.
[83:50.50]I wish I could do this one before.
[83:52.70]I don't know how I missed it.
[83:54.28]Was it not done or did I just miss it somehow?
[83:57.90]I don't know.
[83:59.48]But that's the banana trophy.
[84:00.36]Nice.
[84:01.71]Alright.
[84:01.91]Let's keep going.
[84:04.33]This is somebody's asshole.
[84:08.63]Not the picture.
[84:09.23]Like the photo.
[84:10.09]Not this.
[84:10.57]This.
[84:12.10]I'm talking about, like, the... You know what I'm saying.
[84:14.88]What did I just delete?
[84:20.49]This is, uh, the... Yep.
[84:24.79]The red line.
[84:25.39]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[84:30.91]It's from the video, The Photos Are Written.
[84:34.50]Somebody was asking yesterday, what's the first video I should show somebody that doesn't know who you are?
[84:39.14]The Photos Are Written.
[84:41.84]Yeah, I think that's a pretty good start.
[84:47.66]Hey, welcome to Las Vegas and the carnival.
[84:49.35]This is a cute little photo.
[84:54.63]That's a nice image of my perfect three-day, five o'clock shadow, timed stubble.
[85:02.24]Of course, fireman's there.
[85:03.50]The rat?
[85:03.94]Why is the rat so concerned?
[85:05.24]Is the rat annoyed that fireman's on my shoulder?
[85:15.49]looks very irritated and there's the tent we didn't have a tent but maybe we should have because of the wind but you know you work with what you can and then uh leave a Las Vegas good very very very nice and then of course
[85:42.01]Real actual photograph of the frog in the face.
[85:48.46]Pretty accurate representation.
[85:56.06]Somebody I'm sure is putting the clip in, I would assume, if you hadn't seen it.
[86:01.69]If you didn't see that stream, chat did a wonderful job not winning that game, but hitting me directly in the face.
[86:14.66]There it is.
[86:16.74]I was there.
[86:17.64]I was there.
[86:18.32]No, not the slap.
[86:22.80]That was awesome though.
[86:23.50]That was an amazing time.
[86:26.30]Thank you for everybody for punching me in the face.
[86:29.73]Now you can say you did that.
[86:31.05]You can say I hit Jerma in the face.
[86:33.49]And it would not be a lie.
[86:34.83]It would be true.
[86:36.59]You won.
[86:38.53]This is from my Stardew Valley streams.
[86:42.34]This is the duck person from Stardew Valley.
[86:46.74]That was a long time ago.
[86:54.24]What was this character's name?
[86:55.64]Yeah, this is a full probably three or four years ago.
[87:01.29]Stardew Valley, I think, is some of the first streams I ever did.
[87:06.30]It was Greg?
[87:08.64]Every character is Greg.
[87:09.78]Greg is my go-to when I don't have anything to think of.
[87:12.76]It's just Greg.
[87:16.19]Back to Bed.
[87:16.89]I do remember that, though.
[87:17.83]What a great game.
[87:21.09]What a lovely experience that was.
[87:25.43]I miss it.
[87:26.91]I kind of did everything though.
[87:28.53]And then Kim played it again a couple years ago and she 100%ed the game and I was watching almost the whole time.
[87:35.94]So I can't really play it again, unfortunately.
[87:42.00]And then after that we have jermaHeart.
[87:45.92]Except this is a little more, uh, this is a little more morbid.
[87:50.10]This is a Jerma Stab Heart.
[87:53.70]But it's really cool nonetheless.
[88:00.00]MonkaS!
[88:02.24]Why?
[88:02.52]I think it's great.
[88:13.86]I look very angry though.
[88:16.52]And this is not even supposed to be me.
[88:17.73]This is supposed to be the person living up here.
[88:22.20]If I'm Jeremy and Jex is Jex, this is Jerma.
[88:31.77]Just saying.
[88:34.21]They all share an apartment up here, like in my nose, like through my nose into my brain.
[88:38.30]This is the front door.
[88:39.10]Hey, we've got a two-car garage here.
[88:46.76]That's expensive.
[88:53.78]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[88:57.24]Okay, this is... This is a... I believe this is a Where's Waldo Garfield edition.
[89:05.76]Am I in this somewhere?
[89:07.17]This, like, hurts to look at.
[89:10.99]I have no idea.
[89:25.04]Anybody see it?
[89:29.26]No, there's John, but that's not John.
[89:30.86]It's that looking for me.
[89:32.52]Right?
[89:32.70]Oh, I don't know what I'm looking for.
[89:42.29]Am I looking for me?
[89:43.13]It's just so much orange.
[90:01.82]Alright, I see... What is this?
[90:08.31]There's a Garfield wheel?
[90:11.57]Got it.
[90:12.13]Right there.
[90:16.07]That was good.
[90:16.95]That was a pretty good one.
[90:18.99]Garfield Mario.
[90:23.33]Is Garfield reaching Shrek levels?
[90:28.58]Right?
[90:29.44]You know exactly what I mean by that.
[90:32.37]Not yet.
[90:32.89]Maybe.
[90:34.19]Already surpassed.
[90:35.17]Already was there.
[90:39.26]Okay.
[90:41.02]I'm sometimes curious because I'm seeing some Shrek levels of manipulation here.
[90:48.54]Like, it's Shrek, but Shrek looks like this now.
[90:52.92]It's Shrek, but he's got Mario overalls on.
[90:58.23]I put Shrek's face on a lasagna.
[91:02.39]It's just Ness from EarthBound, but it's Shrek's face.
[91:06.97]We have reached that point.
[91:18.90]Play EarthBound.
[91:19.56]What are you talking about?
[91:22.38]Those are Shrek levels of meme creations.
[91:27.07]Somebody knows what I'm talking about here.
[91:28.75]And that person gets it.
[91:31.19]You know, sometimes you just get it.
[91:40.03]Making the same face.
[91:43.49]That's my shit-eating grin.
[91:44.97]I do it all the time.
[91:49.75]Free me.
[91:52.19]Free me.
[91:52.96]This is Jerma Greed.
[92:00.13]Then there's a seal.
[92:00.93]And I didn't even know what that was until very recently.
[92:03.13]I have no idea where that seal is.
[92:06.15]That seal is on some kind of other completely different journey, a completely new adventure.
[92:13.95]I did not save that seal.
[92:16.05]That seal is doing, has been released into wherever they're going to be.
[92:23.30]They're on their own with a new life.
[92:32.08]The seal spy.
[92:33.60]No, that's just a regular seal.
[92:36.62]But yeah, that's from the carnival inside the money machine.
[92:40.38]It was a lot of fun.
[92:41.78]And this is great.
[92:42.30]I've seen a few of these.
[92:44.89]This is the giant rat.
[92:48.25]It's a fair... A giant rat has a kingpin.
[92:56.27]I do like the double cigar.
[92:58.65]That's a nice touch.
[93:01.55]One for now, one for later.
[93:07.28]And this one is the later one, as you can see, because this one is being dragged down quite a little bit.
[93:11.42]Dual welding cigars.
[93:14.91]How about both for now?
[93:16.93]No, you'll puke.
[93:19.16]I gotta give you some advice here cigars are horrible because unlike a cigarette if you smoke a cigar you are going to throw up because it has so much more concentrated power in it it will you will puke if you smoke if you if you like I'm gonna smoke a full cigar to my just to my face you'll throw up don't inhale a cigar don't smoke a cigar
[93:47.07]If you're going to smoke a cigar, don't breathe it in and don't do enough where you puke.
[93:58.24]Just don't smoke.
[93:58.88]That's easy.
[94:01.40]You taste it and then spit it out.
[94:03.02]Just don't smoke.
[94:04.36]Don't smoke cigars.
[94:06.44]Don't be like this guy.
[94:08.26]He's got two.
[94:09.02]You don't want to do one.
[94:12.60]Somebody just wrote something so, so incorrect that it's making me upset.
[94:27.17]It's a good image though.
[94:29.68]And then a birthday rat.
[94:30.58]It was my birthday recently.
[94:32.80]Happy birthday, right?
[94:34.26]Thank you.
[94:36.47]Tell us what it is.
[94:37.31]They said, no, because I don't want to be the person that gets attributed this shit.
[94:45.95]They said something about it makes you stronger because it makes your lungs work harder.
[94:51.11]No, no, no, no.
[94:53.60]That's what it was.
[94:54.34]That's what it was.
[94:57.00]Happy birthday, rat.
[94:57.88]Thank you.
[94:59.60]Very, very, very cute.
[95:01.86]Everybody loves rats.

[95:35.23]right it is why can't it be happy birthday dude you know what I'm saying with the fireman shirt on and the microphone from the carnival Jerma wild 2 emote it's debated you it's alright you're too small
[96:03.84]I'm not, alright.
[96:06.02]I gotta, I gotta like, I gotta get you guys out of here.
[96:09.71]Like in here.
[96:10.37]Like go to sleep at night, I just hear like, I just see like the images.
[96:18.05]Like the edited fucking images.
[96:20.85]And I like roll around like sweating.
[96:26.35]This is great too.
[96:27.67]I don't even know what, I don't know what this is a reference to.
[96:30.43]But it's cool.
[96:34.79]This is me versus chat when you guys controlled that bot and I, I just, I destroyed you.
[96:39.23]It wasn't even a contest.
[96:40.43]You got like two hits on me.
[96:47.02]Nice try though.
[96:50.82]He doesn't know.
[96:57.94]It's a JoJo thing.
[97:01.35]I'm never going to watch that show, I don't think.
[97:03.14]I don't think it's ever going to happen.
[97:04.58]I've got to be real with everybody in the office here.
[97:08.42]I don't think I'm ever going to do it.
[97:10.44]I keep thinking of times where I might do this.
[97:13.28]And it just never becomes a thing.
[97:20.20]Just read it.
[97:22.16]Read it.
[97:24.21]Stream it.
[97:26.09]I can't stream TV shows.
[97:28.37]I can't stream that.
[97:34.50]Jerma can't read.
[97:37.96]This is great, though.
[97:38.50]I love it.
[97:39.83]Regardless of where this is a reference from or to, it's still a great image.
[97:43.63]Now this one.
[97:46.63]This is fucking amazing.
[97:48.77]This is a very recent stream.
[97:53.33]The FMV night.
[97:55.87]When I was stuck in the rocket wheelchair for 25 minutes.
[98:01.83]It's probably the hardest I've laughed in a long time.
[98:04.28]At least in the last few weeks.
[98:05.62]Last month or two.
[98:07.74]That game was re-diculous.
[98:09.62]That was from Fox Hunt, I believe.
[98:11.61]That's the game, right?
[98:12.27]Fox Hunt.
[98:14.49]That hurt to watch.
[98:18.35]That hurt to watch?
[98:20.00]Imagine how much it hurt to play.
[98:30.32]Who's what?
[98:30.82]Is somebody eating your pizza?
[98:31.96]What?
[98:34.86]It was hilarious to watch.
[98:36.22]It was just an absolute mess, but this is a fantastic... Just encompasses the entire stream.
[98:44.34]Because it was an absolute joke.
[98:48.04]Put a clip of me stuck in the chair.
[98:49.28]If nobody saw that, then that's a good opportunity for you to see it.
[98:51.56]Because it was insane.
[98:54.18]Nobody has any clips of it.
[98:55.48]Oh, too bad.
[98:57.44]It's alright.
[98:59.52]And then this is... I don't know why I included this.
[99:09.63]This is just there?
[99:11.69]I don't know.
[99:12.35]It's like me saying... I don't know what this is.
[99:16.04]What a perfect image to go after that.
[99:19.58]That was... Okay.
[99:24.35]That's... supposed to be... me.
[99:28.41]Doing MonkaS as me.
[99:32.92]New emote.
[99:34.50]No, I can't.
[99:36.50]No, no, no.
[99:45.67]These images in succession.
[99:47.73]They tell a story.
[100:09.11]This is me back in my coal mining days.
[100:19.49]You kind of have to double take this one because it looks like a real image for a second.
[100:24.06]And then you realize, no, it's not.
[100:26.84]It's not at all, actually.
[100:30.56]That was from my vibe stream when that weird charcoal stuff was melting onto my face.
[100:36.91]He hasn't aged a day.
[100:40.62]Look at that hair.
[100:41.64]That hair is disgusting.
[100:49.82]I have such fine hair though, that's the thing.
[100:51.72]I have really fine, baby fine hair that even the slightest variable turns it to shit.
[101:02.48]I will go out like this, okay?
[101:04.80]And I will look like this.
[101:06.44]I will take a step outside, and there will be like a six mile per hour wind gust.
[101:12.19]Six, like maybe five miles per hour.
[101:14.89]And it just, it turns in a second into just madness like this.
[101:21.54]And I'm constantly like, fuck, goddammit.
[101:26.13]And I don't wear, uh, gel.
[101:28.37]I don't do, like, gel or, um, hairspray.
[101:33.37]I can't.
[101:33.85]Because when I do hairspray, this is the one thing that you need to remember about when you put products in your hair.
[101:39.10]You gotta get it out.
[101:40.74]Because if you sleep in that shit, it goes, stays in here, and goes down and just gives you this greasy, gross, fucking hairline.
[101:50.95]And I just break out all around my whole hairline.
[101:54.92]So you have to, if you go out and you put product in your hair, when you come back, you have to shower.
[102:01.46]And sometimes that's a pain in the ass because you're tired.
[102:04.06]And how many times have you just been like, alright, it's like 10, 11, 12, whatever, I don't know, 1, 2, 3, who knows how late it is.
[102:11.73]And then you have to go take a shower when you'd rather just go lie down and go to bed.
[102:19.94]I don't put product in my hair at all.
[102:24.79]use the water-based pomade I it doesn't work it makes me just look like a sicko not shampoo yeah I shampoo in condition don't go all the way to the roots so wait you won't no don't go all the way to the roots so you want to put like like hair gel like here
[102:53.62]And then when the gust of wind comes through, this happens.
[102:56.98]Are you ready?
[102:57.95]If I were to do just right here, when the gust of wind happens, this happens.
[103:09.03]And that's what I end up with.
[103:18.34]And it's unfixable.
[103:21.68]His hair is fucked.
[103:23.87]No, it's just fine.
[103:24.88]It's really fine, and I just let it do whatever it's going to do.
[103:28.80]But I like it like this.
[103:30.12]I like the way it looks like this.
[103:36.07]I don't want to shave it off.
[103:37.19]Am I sweating?
[103:40.01]Probably.
[103:44.03]I liked it shorter.
[103:45.03]I like it short, but I like it like this.
[103:48.36]This is how I'm going to wear it, and I'm going to cut it again soon.
[103:53.25]I'm a Red Dead Redemption 2 NPC.
[103:58.33]Here.
[103:59.31]Is what you mean.
[104:01.03]Because I'm curious.
[104:02.03]I don't understand how me.
[104:04.10]You're talking about here.
[104:06.20]Okay.
[104:08.32]Whoa!
[104:08.64]We're in close, but this is one guy.
[104:13.02]Whoever you are.
[104:14.08]Doing a little dance.
[104:16.36]GIF.
[104:17.59]Image.
[104:21.79]Very cute.
[104:25.66]And yes, for the future when we do these again.
[104:30.42]Make sure you watermark it.
[104:32.00]Just throw a little thing.
[104:33.42]Even if it's a copy of the image.
[104:35.10]If you don't want to do anything to the original.
[104:37.51]Copy the image.
[104:38.17]Put a little thing on it just so we know whose it is.
[104:42.67]I said gif.
[104:43.89]I didn't say jif.
[104:48.11]It's a gif.
[104:49.99]I know it's pronounced jif.
[104:53.36]Whatever.
[104:53.58]Whatever.
[104:55.39]But this is very cute.
[105:20.23]This is the fireman gif.
[105:22.79]Fireman gif.
[105:26.65]That was Glue Man and me, apparently.
[105:31.74]Everybody loves Fireman.
[105:32.62]I love Fireman.
[105:33.38]I'm noticing a lot of Fireman content.
[105:36.82]It's really cool.
[105:42.73]Go back to the Glue Man.
[105:44.09]Fine.
[105:48.57]Here you go.
[106:03.32]You know how my Twitter banner is just this?
[106:06.74]Should change it to just this.
[106:19.01]It's good stuff, though.
[106:20.79]Fireman, and then we have the Rat Knight.
[106:28.08]Uh, is that Shovel Knight?
[106:29.82]Is that Shovel Knight armor?
[106:34.50]It's good shit, though.
[106:39.12]No.
[106:40.22]It's just a rat.
[106:41.74]It's rat.
[106:43.38]It's rat night.
[106:44.80]Or it's rat man.
[106:50.22]That's rocket night.
[106:51.52]No, okay.
[106:53.06]Every night is shuffle night.
[106:55.68]Yeah, just like how every game is Dark Souls.
[107:02.34]I love it, though.
[107:04.47]I love these shoes.
[107:05.49]I love the boots.
[107:09.95]He's ratting us out.
[107:12.66]Good shit.
[107:14.82]This is one of the most recent ones.
[107:17.00]This is from the numbers going upstream last night.
[107:23.96]There's a joke here.
[107:25.16]I'm sure you can figure it out.
[107:27.99]One of the people that worked on the game made this.
[107:31.99]We showed it last night, but I want to show it again.
[107:35.13]Viewers going down.
[107:36.41]Yeah.
[107:44.64]Don't matter.
[107:49.50]Dev in chat.
[107:50.28]No, actually, yes.
[107:54.66]But yeah, that's good shit.
[107:55.98]Thank you for that.
[107:58.14]This also happened last night.
[108:00.61]This actually hurts.
[108:01.39]I can't look at this.
[108:01.85]It hurts my head.
[108:05.29]Birthday Shito.
[108:10.13]I forgot we did this shit.
[108:11.83]What a weird stream.
[108:13.45]No emotion.
[108:17.85]This is like the vacuum cleaners.
[108:20.23]Like, oh, okay.
[108:22.65]The Shito.
[108:23.37]Birthday Shito.
[108:29.52]Yeah, I need to make like, I need to have like one of these be like an actual emote.
[108:33.53]And that is it.
[108:34.57]That's the last of the artwork.
[108:36.71]Or the drawn or written content.
[108:41.90]Good stuff.
[108:43.82]There were a lot of them.
[108:45.16]They were very, very good.
[108:47.10]And we have a lot more to see.
[108:53.54]If you put something... By the way, this is as of last night.
[108:58.33]So this is as of like yesterday.
[109:00.77]So anything that was put in there yesterday after I essentially went to bed is not in this stream.
[109:07.12]Whatever we stop at, at that point going forward, is where I pull from.
[109:14.28]So.
[109:16.50]Nerd neck.
[109:17.56]Give me one second.
[109:20.69]That took about two hours.
[109:21.57]Alright, that's good to know.
[109:22.41]That's good to know.
[109:22.81]It took about like an hour and 45 minutes or so.
[109:26.02]Where do you do this?
[109:27.32]In the Discord, there is a public community Discord.
[109:31.02]There is a channel called Community Content Knights.
[109:34.42]You put it there.
[109:38.77]There are rules there.
[109:39.41]You got to follow those rules.
[109:40.85]It could be a video content.
[109:42.09]It could be Photoshopped content.
[109:45.57]It could be original artwork.
[109:47.17]As long as it's put there, I will go through that.
[109:49.81]And that's where I pull it through.
[109:52.01]So we're going to move on to the video portion.
[109:57.41]of the stream should be probably another couple hours or so I would assume uh and there's deep fakes in there well you could but that's fine just this rule just as long as you follow the rules you're gonna be fine so give me one second as I switch to the video portion uh let me just do this real quick just wanna make sure I can actually get it on here and maybe because this probably like this is probably just about halfway point maybe we should take a little pee break what do you think
[110:27.52]Yeah, because we're going to be here for a little while longer.
[110:34.79]Yeah, let's go pee.
[110:36.39]Well, I mean, like, just go pee.
[110:38.57]I'll be back in like fucking two minutes, three minutes.
[113:02.71]Hello, I'm back.
[113:05.67]So we have, oh boy, we have like, we got a lot of videos.
[113:12.66]So we're gonna get this started.
[113:17.26]We're gonna open it with something.
[113:21.90]Not that.
[113:27.45]With that.
[113:29.05]Take a look at those tabs up there.
[113:34.59]There's a lot.
[113:36.59]Actually, let me go like this.
[113:42.01]Get in here.
[113:44.23]Make this look a little cleaner.
[113:48.42]Like this.
[113:53.40]Make this a little bigger.
[113:57.50]Like that.
[114:01.16]Porn test.
[114:04.79]Alright.
[114:06.54]Using Chrome.
[114:07.10]This is Chrome.
[114:08.38]I'm glad you picked up on that.
[114:10.82]Alright.
[114:11.02]This one's called Jerma Jam.
[114:14.20]Is it the same shirt?
[114:15.08]No, it's a nice gray shirt though.
[114:17.30]I approve.
[114:20.61]He's not using Edge.
[114:21.81]That's alright.
[114:22.23]Alright.
[114:22.69]We're going to play with the audio on this one because I don't know how loud it's going to be, but we'll see.
[114:27.71]Here we go.
[114:27.99]This is called Jerma Jam.
[114:30.86]Jerma Jam.
[114:50.01]Why was I in the car?
[114:51.36]Oh, that was the sound!
[115:00.59]Wait, that's me turning the wheel?
[115:26.58]Dragon.
[116:01.88]750 people are now subscribed to the channel.
[116:05.80]I have nothing to say besides thank you so much.
[116:07.94]Jerma here for the 2,000 subscriber extraordinaire.
[116:12.73]Thank you all so, so much for subscribing to the channel.
[116:16.67]I really do appreciate the 4,000.
[116:18.01]Let's keep rolling, everybody.
[116:19.47]I want to welcome you to the 15th
[116:23.78]I can't believe I'm actually saying that, but thank you.
[117:09.67]Oh, you actually got the QRS.
[117:12.27]Let me know if you want any help in FL Studio.
[117:14.07]I'll be happy to help.
[117:15.81]Hell yeah.
[117:19.01]That was fucking awesome.
[117:24.30]Alright.
[117:27.62]I want to hit the QRS one more time.
[117:29.48]That was awesome.
[118:00.48]The best part about that is you can hear me very clearly hitting the wall where I'm actually capable.
[118:06.60]It's like when you get to a certain point when you sing and you hit the absolute, I cannot do this, but I'm going to try anyways.
[118:14.85]That's how you get like the, like now I know my A. You can't like go any higher.
[118:23.75]There's no going over that, but you still try and it ends up sounding like a horn that is too much air coming out of.
[118:34.21]I got a fee- yeah, exactly.
[118:36.79]Uh, you got- here, here's the link.
[118:38.51]Those of you that are looking for the link.
[118:41.51]Uh, why can I not- what the fuck are you doing?
[118:43.49]Give it- It's CTRL-C, right?
[118:46.09]CTRL-C is copy.
[118:48.48]I'm learning every day.
[118:52.76]There it is.
[118:56.16]Alright, so, uh, that was that.
[118:58.34]That was, uh, JermaJam.
[119:00.14]It's really good shit.
[119:02.83]Good job.
[119:03.21]Are you serious?

[130:49.48]If you're ready, let's kick it off.
[130:51.26]And to get an update from our friends at one of the most celebrated development studios in the world, Bethesda Game Studios, please welcome studio head and my good friend, Todd Howard.
[131:03.60]Are there any gamers in here?
[131:09.85]Of course there is.
[131:15.13]Got quite a lineup this year.
[131:17.80]Last year we saw some of the best games, highly reviewed, that we've ever had as a company here.
[131:26.05]And we have you all to thank.
[131:28.99]Our average Metacritic score reached over 58.
[131:38.40]And I find it completely necessary to now show you, the fans,
[131:45.68]a brand new experience that you won't have anywhere else.
[131:52.46]I need to pause it.
[131:55.20]Wait, wait, wait.
[131:55.72]Can I just pause it for one second?
[131:58.36]I think this is like the first or second time anyone has ever used this footage.
[132:03.06]Nobody used that because it has no context for anything.
[132:12.74]The white socks.
[132:14.10]I'll show you
[132:15.92]The fans.
[132:16.74]Any gamers in here?
[132:17.80]A brand new experience that you won't have anywhere else.
[132:23.72]World premiere.
[132:28.82]So, I guess you need to explore in this game.
[132:31.29]There was a crash.
[132:32.37]Oh, no.
[132:32.77]I need to investigate the mystery of the crash.
[132:36.19]Wait, what?
[132:36.51]Which is what I plan on doing.
[132:38.31]Let's go ahead and go.
[132:38.95]Oh, fuck.
[132:43.38]That's him.
[132:44.40]Can I get away without him seeing?
[132:45.52]That's the main thing that's got to be... No, no, he's right behind me.
[132:48.92]He's right behind me.
[132:49.46]Oh, my God.
[132:49.84]Oh, my God.
[132:50.10]Oh, my God.
[132:50.98]If I can make it up these stairs, please.
[132:53.60]It's an alien.
[132:55.04]It's a fucking alien.
[132:57.57]Where is he?
[132:59.57]Where'd he go?
[133:04.07]The doors are all locked.
[133:05.59]I'm trapped in this spooky game.
[133:07.39]What do I do?
[133:07.93]Oh, I guess I could climb in here.
[133:10.19]It's an old video.
[133:10.83]Turn my flashlight on.

[133:25.58]Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[133:27.50]Straight down, straight down, straight down the stairs.
[133:29.82]Come on, come on, come on, come on, I know you can hide.
[133:32.22]Hide in here, open it, okay.
[133:38.00]Shh, quiet in here, I don't wanna, if I make any noise, I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble.
[133:43.62]Oh, please don't come in here and kill me.
[133:46.73]What the fuck is he doing?
[133:49.03]That's psycho.
[133:52.19]What is it?

[134:37.06]Let me get you a link.
[134:39.16]I don't want you to see how many videos are left, though.
[134:41.06]You know what I mean?
[134:43.48]I don't want you to see how many videos are left.
[134:47.61]That spoils everything.
[134:56.47]Alright.
[134:57.46]So this next one is... This is Jerma985 Jerm Animated Fan Art.
[135:03.62]This is actually ridiculous.
[135:05.50]You guys ready for this?
[135:05.98]It's a very short video, but check this out.
[135:13.36]That's like Slimer from Ghostbusters.
[135:21.44]That's a real 3D shit.
[135:27.23]It's really impressive.
[135:28.29]I like the lighting inside the mouth.
[135:35.67]Look at that.
[135:36.01]Let's do it one more time.
[135:44.64]The tongue coming out of the mouth.

[135:48.74]I don't know.
[135:49.10]What made The Simpsons writing so special?
[135:50.74]Maybe you'll find out one day.
[135:52.70]Here's a link to that one.
[135:53.26]It's called the Jerma985 Jerma animated fan art.
[135:59.68]Here it is.
[135:59.98]Yeah, take a look at the top.
[136:01.32]Actually, you can't even see the top.

[136:07.03]I'm not gonna, no, we have like 40 videos to watch.
[136:10.37]I'm not watching a Simpsons breakdown of why the writing degraded after season four.
[136:17.73]You could put that on a playlist and listen to it in your car.
[136:21.55]Alright, let's keep going.
[136:23.83]Coming up next.
[136:29.46]Is Jerma and the Bee, this is a Dreams level.

[137:42.07]It's just, it's always scary.
[137:44.19]Always.
[138:04.84]And I know, save the bees.
[138:05.86]The bees are so important to us.
[138:08.07]But they're terrifying just because you know what they're capable of.
[138:10.19]The running animation is just like... Do you win?
[138:21.67]Do you beat it?

[149:02.28]It was just red crayon on the belt.
[149:05.14]I just thought that's what they did there.

[154:03.50]You'll find it somehow.
[154:08.67]Coming up next is, I think we've seen this, it's called Jerma and the Dark Guy.
[154:15.76]I walk out the door and there's just the, there's the dark guy and he's just lined up the shot and you're like, okay, go ahead.
[154:23.39]And he's just like, hold on.
[154:27.91]That happens.
[154:28.55]By the way, this happens like two or three times a week.
[154:32.81]After a year, you're going to like kick out the dark.
[154:37.34]Jesus Christ.
[154:38.42]That was loud.

[155:00.15]The door closes and he's gone.
[155:01.72]By the way, two months later, a dart hits your like window.
[155:06.94]And you look out, you're like that motherfucker.
[155:08.44]And he's just like, and he fucking runs away.

[155:36.75]Get rid of him.
[155:37.27]He's in your house?

[157:05.44]One guy?
[157:05.94]Isn't that him?
[157:43.03]Look at all those parakeets on screen at once.
[157:53.72]I don't- I don't- Usually when I see an image of myself, I know where it's from, sort of.

[158:15.60]I love watching other people create scenarios around things I've done.
[158:21.73]It's fucking wonderful.
[158:23.85]He's an egomaniac.
[158:26.53]He's a narcissist.

[161:12.12]Calculating.
[161:16.45]Fever, Steve, fast Jerm, appropriate life, Frosty.
[161:22.49]Frosty wins the cool guy contest.
[161:30.13]It appears as though they have misunderstood the contest.
[161:37.40]That was... That was fucking wild.
[161:50.23]That was a dream.
[161:54.01]That was... That was perfect.
[161:57.49]That should be a children's TV show.
[162:02.83]Think about it.
[162:03.89]Maybe.
[162:05.33]We got a lot more to do.
[162:07.41]You thought, yeah, this is a good indicator.
[162:09.47]This is about three hours.
[162:13.13]There's much more to see.
[162:15.15]You guys have just absolutely knocked it out of the park.
[162:18.47]That's why I want to do the green screen again.
[162:21.22]Because I feel like so much interesting shit comes out of these green screen videos.
[162:28.41]And when we did the first one, it was like, oh, that was cool.
[162:30.49]Do it again.
[162:30.91]Yeah, I guess I was only going to do it that one time, but I guess we'll do it again.
[162:35.79]And the encore happened recently, and it was awesome.
[162:38.81]And then people are still making these things.
[162:42.75]So why not do like another seven hours in front of a green screen and put on more costumes and stuff and give you guys more material?
[162:51.67]Just keep adding more material.
[162:53.02]Maybe.
[162:53.84]Maybe.
[162:56.37]It seems like you guys have a lot of fun with this, and they're really, really fun to watch on stream.
[163:03.17]Maybe I'll get back in that studio and do it again.
[163:07.60]Making an entire cinematic universe, yeah.
[163:11.92]Something to think about.
[163:14.88]But let's see, did I link that?
[163:16.14]I did, I think.
[163:16.68]Did I link it?
[163:17.94]Just in case I didn't.
[163:21.77]The JCU.
[163:24.36]Just random clips of me puking, pretending to rip my pants, and punching the air.
[163:29.66]What a cinematic universe that is.
[163:34.84]Let's go.
[163:38.56]This is called Alex Jones Spots a Liberal.
[163:44.69]Come on over here.
[163:45.67]Come on over here.

[164:32.20]Short King.
[164:35.99]Why does a scale say 5'1"?
[164:39.99]A scale does not tell you how tall you are.
[164:42.35]It tells you how much you weigh.
[164:44.77]That's why it's called a scale.
[164:48.52]I'm five foot something but my bills I'll pay on my tippy toes from la to the bay going off the deep end chill in the shallow you don't need your heels girl just bring a towel I'm five

[171:20.89]Just, yeah, just puke into your underwear.
[171:24.61]It's true.
[171:26.09]Imagine seeing somebody go, oh, no.
[171:27.94]They're, like, pulling their pants and just puking down into their fucking underwear.
[171:35.32]That would be the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[171:38.63]I would never get over it.
[171:40.81]Ever.
[171:41.87]That would be the only thing I could think of for the rest of my life.
[171:44.61]It would be... Okay, I'm thinking right now as if I've seen this.
[171:52.10]I've never seen this, but I'm laughing because of it.
[171:55.08]Now I'm laughing after that.
[171:56.34]This didn't happen.
[171:59.34]Guys, but it's true though.
[172:02.40]You see, if you puke forward, if you're on a roller coaster and you puke forward...
[172:07.92]It's going to spray and hit everybody.
[172:11.51]Not just one person's vacation.
[172:13.43]How many people can go on a ride?
[172:15.05]On a roller coaster or a spinny ride?

[180:06.43]This person made the... Okay, so the context here is... Remember when I talked about if you were just screaming?
[180:13.31]You turned on a live stream and it was just you screaming the full blast for like three or four hours.
[180:21.26]And you just looped it and put it and made it as that.

[189:13.07]You'd have to say, okay.
[189:19.41]I'll be bored of this.
[189:20.39]No country for old lambs.
[189:22.07]Because I killed Santa.
[189:31.08]Please to count one and two.
[189:33.74]I look like Jerry Garcia.
[189:38.55]What's the number one thing people do?
[189:39.75]Real court.
[189:41.29]The real court?
[189:42.71]Punch him, punch him, punch Santa.

[191:20.48]Okay.
[191:26.72]You guys might be too young.
[191:28.83]Every single person learned how to do the... It's true.
[191:33.45]It's true.
[191:36.61]I just stopped playing, like, fucking Evanescence.

[192:00.99]Don't say yes.
[192:03.83]Do I eat ass?
[192:05.33]No.

[192:44.24]You shouldn't have done that.
[192:51.80]No, no, no.
[192:52.20]I'm talking about, like, me.
[192:53.82]I don't think that... Is that from the green screen?
[193:05.11]Is it Oblivion?
[193:05.91]When was I... When was I in, like, a button-up shirt?
[193:11.97]I don't remember being in these clothes.
[193:15.13]Why was I in a button-up shirt?
[193:17.19]I was at a dinner party?
[193:22.33]Oh, I have no idea.
[193:33.50]No, at the family dinner I was wearing blue.
[193:35.62]I had a nice blue.
[193:38.44]Gray.

[193:59.01]Another five to ten, give or take.
[194:09.62]This is called Reality Unfolds Around Man Crying to Farting and Screaming.
[194:34.82]No, no, no!
[194:36.08]I'm fucking crying!

[194:45.97]You're killing me!
[194:55.04]You can hear it.
[194:57.70]Listen, you can hear it in the ears.
[194:59.62]That's how loud this shit was.
[195:01.96]Listen closely.
[195:14.81]I've seen this image before.
[195:17.39]This has been linked to me like a shitload of times.
[195:20.05]This.
[195:22.88]I've seen that.
[195:24.28]A lot.
[195:27.92]Please, I don't want to listen anymore.
[195:30.76]I'm sorry.
[195:31.50]I'm sorry.
[195:31.98]I don't even get to link that one.
[195:35.24]Yeah, I do.
[195:35.84]I gotta link them all.
[195:41.43]Reality unfolds.
[195:45.40]Okay, now, I'm going to go here.
[195:50.63]This is called Jerma Lied About Ace Attorney.
[195:52.95]I've proven that I have not lied about Ace Attorney.
[195:55.69]I just didn't want to play it.
[195:59.34]Let's see what they're going to bring to court here.
[196:03.88]Let's get back to writing.
[196:10.14]February 2nd, 2019, your client stated on stream that he would play Ace Attorney Trilogy soon.
[196:15.54]As of October 2019, this still has yet to happen.
[196:19.20]Furthermore, your client has known history of making promises he can't keep.
[196:22.22]And lying about them when pressed.
[196:29.79]Face it right.
[196:31.23]Jermba lied about Minecraft VR.
[196:32.95]Jermba lied about Taco Bell.
[196:34.21]Jermba lied about Ace Attorney.
[196:35.57]Oh, this is bad.
[196:39.90]Is it possible to prove that Jerma is an honest man?
[196:42.84]With the polygraph.
[196:49.01]Teddy, look at this, your honor.
[196:51.73]What is this?
[196:54.15]These would be the results from the polygraph test my client took.
[196:59.40]Could you read the results to the court, your honor?
[197:03.04]Why, he's incredibly honest!
[197:08.04]Oh, it wasn't a fucking goddamn stepladder.
[197:09.84]Something might even say he's the most transparent streamer on Switch!
[197:14.80]That wasn't even a real doctor, he was clearly a hired actor.
[197:18.68]Doesn't matter if the doctor was an actor, the polygraph machine was real.
[197:23.00]The polygraph machine was a cheap laptop from the right of the shelf at Best Buy.
[197:40.03]One month in the electric chair.
[197:44.57]One full month.
[197:47.75]Guilty.
[197:50.95]Guilty.
[197:56.30]Here's the thing, though.
[197:57.66]I wasn't asked about Ace Attorney on the polygraph, so the polygraph would not be admissible in court.
[198:02.98]If you want to know if I eat ass or not, maybe you could bring that to court.
[198:14.35]great here's a link we got four more videos actually six seven more videos and then we have a couple songs to to just chill out too let's go this is 2015 Jerma versus 2019 Jerma
[198:44.86]Let's see who wins.
[198:45.40]I don't want to fight you.
[198:47.84]I don't want to.
[198:48.78]Oh, you?
[198:50.16]Oh, you?
[198:51.54]I saved the best for you.
[198:52.62]I kicked his ass.
[199:02.37]I kicked the shit out of him.
[199:03.47]I don't want to fight you.
[199:04.03]I don't want to.
[199:04.89]Oh, you?
[199:06.27]Oh, you?
[199:07.65]I saved the best for you.
[199:08.75]Didn't even need to try.
[199:18.45]The problem is you... What's that in the bottom right?
[199:24.05]So the problem is in 2015, that was a PSI camera, which is like...
[199:32.52]Like 140p.
[199:35.45]2019 Jerma was in front of a 1080p camera.
[199:38.49]That's the issue.
[199:39.05]Maybe if you've been tracked correctly, 2015 Jerma, you may have stood a chance, but I guess not.
[199:44.83]Why are they fighting?
[199:45.49]I don't know.
[199:46.93]I don't know.
[199:54.71]And I have a confession to make.
[199:57.09]These next few videos, I saw one and then I had to get the other two that are like my favorites in that same series.
[200:06.80]Okay.
[200:08.00]These were not submitted.
[200:09.32]This one was, but the next two were not.
[200:11.79]They're just like my favorite videos in that same realm of series.
[200:15.77]Okay.
[200:18.59]Let's show the one that was submitted recently.
[200:25.48]I love these so much.
[200:31.24]Left field and the Red Sox are winners.
[200:40.67]Manny Ramirez with an absolute rocket into the Boston Knight and the Red Sox lead the series two games to none.
[200:50.16]That's it.
[200:51.32]The at bat the Red Sox have looked for all night.
[200:54.65]Okay, so that's that one.
[200:58.63]So here's another one.
[201:00.51]There's a few of these and I love them.
[201:03.24]So we have to watch them all.
[201:04.06]I don't care.
[201:06.24]I just hit so many home runs.
[201:08.54]I'm so good.
[201:09.52]Okay, cool.
[201:10.24]This one's my favorite.

[204:12.76]That's not true.
[204:13.80]Incorrect.
[204:14.52]I just made an incorrect statement.
[204:17.60]Anyways, coming up we have a Twitter video that I couldn't figure out how to get to work, but I'm just going to try.
[204:26.82]So here's the Twitter video.
[204:28.21]It's from, obviously, Google to Gareth.
[204:31.03]And this thing has been auto-playing for the last three and a half hours.
[204:37.05]So here we go.
[204:37.97]Let's see if I can get this to be full-screened.
[204:39.69]I can't.
[204:40.63]Okay, so this is called, I don't know what this is called, but it's the wine, it's a wine thing.
[204:47.07]I can't even put into words how upset I am right now.
[204:50.79]I missed the wine convention by two hours, and I bought this special red wine suit to prove how much I love wine, and now what am I supposed to do, throw it in the trash?
[205:01.31]Oh, hey, Jerma.
[205:01.75]Get the fuck out of here.
[205:05.01]This is a monster from Monster Hunter.
[205:06.90]I can't even put into words how upset I am right now.
[205:10.62]I missed the wine convention by two hours.
[205:13.94]And I bought this special red wine suit to prove how much I love wine.
[205:18.59]And now what am I supposed to do?
[205:19.79]Throw it in the trash?
[205:21.15]Oh, hey, Jerma.
[205:21.59]Get the fuck out of here.
[205:26.41]You just animate.
[205:28.95]No, that was awesome.
[205:30.68]Awesome, awesome stuff.
[205:32.32]I don't know how some of you guys do it.
[205:34.46]Alright, the next two are... They're not... I had to put them on my computer.
[205:43.13]So... Googly Gareth makes great fucking animations, of course.
[205:49.29]Let's move on.
[205:50.61]This one is... I don't know.
[205:52.35]It's going to be a surprise for all of us because I have no idea.
[205:58.04]It's so simple, but I find a way, I find a way.
[206:04.04]If you open up your mind, it's going to take some time to realize.
[206:13.82]Alright, this is from the same two days.
[206:16.85]But if you look inside, I'm sure you'll find
[206:42.38]The best the best part about this is sincerely That's like a whole TV show but That was those clips are taken over the course of like four hours.
[206:54.65]I
[206:58.53]Looks like you got canceled after one episode.
[207:04.74]Like a real TV show.
[207:06.22]No, we lost the fucking license.
[207:10.76]Not anymore.
[207:11.30]Alright, coming up next, this is the final video.
[207:18.67]Of the... This Family Guy, of course.
[207:22.59]I don't get this one.
[207:23.83]Somebody's gonna have to... I don't get this.
[207:28.88]Brian, do you know where Peter is?
[207:30.74]Yeah, he and the guys went to go rob your dad.
[207:33.69]I believe you.
[207:41.55]I mean... That's it.
[207:49.38]Is this supposed to be me?
[207:51.22]By the way, this is called Jerma chin.
[207:55.30]Is this a chin joke?
[207:58.43]Oh.
[208:01.28]Oh, right.
[208:01.92]Okay.
[208:04.22]Because somebody made me in FamilyGuyCreator.com or whatever.
[208:17.39]Alright.
[208:18.01]That was that.
[208:19.41]And that is the end of the videos.
[208:24.67]There was like an hour and 30 minutes of them.
[208:28.27]So now, we're going to move on to the music.
[208:30.57]There's a couple of tracks that somebody gave.
[208:36.02]What a dumb video to go out on.
[208:38.58]We're not going out, yeah?
[208:39.18]What are you talking about?
[208:40.82]The stream's not over, yeah?
[208:42.64]There's still a few more things to see.
[208:46.95]Do the Blend S one one more time.
[208:50.81]Okay.
[208:51.59]Yeah, I mean, that was un-fucking- That was ridiculous.
[208:54.55]I have to say it again.
[208:55.27]You're right.
[208:56.67]Yeah, you're right.
[208:57.14]You're right.
[208:59.60]Uh, which one was it?
[209:00.39]It was right here.
[209:01.95]Okay, this is the final.
[209:02.89]This is the encore for this one.
[209:04.51]I'm going off cam.
[209:05.53]We want a full view of it.
[209:25.10]5'8 is male height.
[209:29.12]Average male.
[209:30.61]I'm average.
[209:32.23]I'm compact.
[209:33.01]That was very, very small.
[209:35.59]5'10 is average in the US.
[209:36.54]Sorry, Jeremy, you're a dwarf.
[209:37.86]No!
[209:38.32]Hold on, hold on.
[209:38.88]I'm not that short.
[209:39.62]I promise.
[209:40.62]I'm like 5'2".
[209:42.60]I wasn't talking about the U.S.
[209:43.91]I was talking about divorce land.
[209:46.09]You guys don't know what it's like to be short.
[209:47.93]I take a shower, and I'm out of the shower, and I'm looking at myself.
[209:51.24]Squeezing my, like, butt cheeks together.
[209:52.94]You're a fucking tiny thing.
[209:54.52]That's a fact.
[209:56.44]Oh, by the way, I'm not like 5'8".
[209:58.24]I'm not tiny.
[210:00.56]I'm 5 feet tall.
[210:01.30]You're fucking tiny, Jerma.
[210:03.43]Yeah.
[210:03.81]Coffee chicken.
[210:05.15]Do I eat ass?
[210:06.19]Yeah.
[210:06.59]Of course I do.
[210:07.67]I'm like 5'2".
[210:08.63]That's not his problem.
[210:10.41]Jerma's fucking tiny.
[210:11.39]Yeah.
[210:11.81]Coffee chicken.
[210:12.87]Hold on, hold on.
[210:13.79]I'm not that short.
[210:14.71]I brought it.
[210:15.27]I'm 3 feet tall.
[210:16.05]Yeah.
[210:16.45]Coffee chicken.
[210:17.29]Sorry, Jeremy, you're a dwarf.
[210:19.46]No.
[210:19.92]I'm like 5 feet tall.
[210:21.02]No.
[210:21.28]I'm like 5 feet tall.
[210:22.82]I wasn't talking about you, Jerma.
[210:25.28]Wait, did he say five feet ass?
[210:35.71]Did I say five feet ass?
[210:38.41]No, no, did I?
[210:39.93]That was fucking awesome.
[210:47.02]Alright, let's get to the songs.
[210:49.12]There are a few things here.
[210:50.02]Let's put the camera back on.
[210:52.57]Let's get this in a spot where it needs to be.
[210:58.72]So that was kind of it, in a way.
[211:03.06]I knew it was going to take somewhere between three to four hours.
[211:06.22]That's kind of what I was planning.
[211:08.04]The length of this one?
[211:09.09]Oh, yeah.
[211:09.47]I did it earlier, but I've got to do it again.
[211:11.93]This is art right now.
[211:15.47]So you could, judging by how long this took, you can expect them to all sort of be this sort of similar length, like a three to four, probably this would be about four hours, I would assume.
[211:28.32]Let me move this, I can make the camera bigger, and we'll listen to the, there's a couple of music tracks to listen to.
[211:33.53]Oh, oh, oh!
[211:40.11]Don't fucking do that.
[211:41.79]Some of you did.
[211:45.81]Alright, let's get the music on here.
[211:48.11]There are two tracks.
[211:49.62]This is called The Only Good Joke Is The Beginning.
[211:57.24]Okay.
[211:59.53]What do you mean by that, though?
[212:01.81]The Only Good Joke Is In The Beginning.
[212:04.99]Let's see.
[212:05.97]Here it comes.
[212:28.01]Alright.
[212:28.61]Alright.
[212:29.68]I see where you're going.
[212:31.26]Alright.
[212:59.26]Fucking Michael's mom is pissed.
[213:13.71]Here's the link to that one.
[213:15.69]Did I lose connection to Twitch?
[213:20.83]How come I can't see... I guess I'm still here.
[213:24.82]There's that one.
[213:26.07]And there's another one.
[213:26.79]This is called I Made This With a Clip of the Labo.
[213:30.67]So this is a Nintendo Labo song.
[213:33.79]Both of these, by the way, made by the same person.
[213:36.63]Let's check this one out.
[213:39.01]Okay, we're ready.
[214:13.17]I didn't make this.
[214:14.07]It's pretty good.
[214:16.47]What's my SoundCloud?
[214:17.83]I don't have one.
[214:19.43]I just listen to other talented SoundCloud artists.
[214:23.05]And go like this.
[214:44.80]Nice!
[214:45.06]You should do one.
[214:46.24]It actually works.
[214:47.14]That was pretty good.
[214:48.76]That was a nice beat.
[215:15.39]No emotion for two minutes.
[215:17.91]We did that yesterday.
[215:19.39]And I lost fucking 1,500 viewers.
[215:23.27]Those people aren't ever coming back.
[215:28.11]Alright, that's the end of that.
[215:29.83]I have zero viewers now.
[215:35.67]Shit.
[215:41.51]They don't want to be here anymore.
[215:44.96]But before we move on, I'm going to just hang out for a little bit.
[215:50.19]I want to tell you that thank you, first of all, for everybody that submitted everything.
[215:58.47]You guys are immensely talented.
[216:00.09]I am shocked every day when new videos, new artwork, everything comes in.
[216:04.47]And this was number one.
[216:05.95]So I think it was a success.
[216:08.45]I think this is a cool idea.
[216:09.67]I think this is a better idea than just showing this stuff.
[216:13.84]at the very end of a live stream when the wind down happens.
[216:17.72]I think this is a much better idea.
[216:21.79]Tons of great videos, tons of great artwork.
[216:24.77]My body hurts from laughing at a few of those.
[216:28.01]And I'm in awe at the sheer amount of talent some of you artists can put forth onto a piece of paper.
[216:32.93]It's fucking incredible.
[216:34.93]So, the next community content night is probably going to be
[216:43.06]whenever there is about four-ish hours of content I think that's a good I think that's a good clean community night you know what I mean so it's when I announced that channel about what like a month ago that was like just about what 30 35 days ago something like that
[217:05.50]I would say probably once a month it'll probably happen.
[217:08.22]And if there's not enough to fill, because I see how many tabs here, I'm going to count how many videos there were, how many pictures there were, to see how long it took to go through it.
[217:18.96]So you'll see hopefully once a month, if not that, then every other month.
[217:23.49]We'll do just a night like this.
[217:28.37]So it should be good.
[217:30.53]After this stream, it'll be full in a week.
[217:34.49]Then we'll have plenty of stuff to go through.
[217:36.63]So, that should be good.
[217:40.57]Who are you talking to if we're not real?
[217:43.38]Wait, what is going on with Twitch right now?
[217:45.92]If I go to twitch.tv, does nobody have any viewers?
[217:48.20]Is there zero viewers across the whole website?
[217:52.86]Or is it just me?
[217:55.63]Everybody.
[217:55.97]Uh-oh.
[217:58.45]Uh-oh.
[217:59.81]Everybody has zero viewers.
[218:02.63]It's all been a lie from the very beginning.
[218:05.47]It's all, it's been a sham.
[218:09.07]You're all not real.
[218:13.77]Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.
[218:16.71]Didn't work, it's real.
[218:25.20]I knew it.
[218:26.90]No, I think that's, I think that's a good cap.
[218:30.22]I think that's a good cap for the night.
[218:32.76]I could... What time is it?
[218:36.50]5.30?
[218:36.52]4 hours?
[218:37.74]Yeah.
[218:38.24]I think that's a good cap for the night.
[218:42.24]So I will see you guys.
[218:46.44]I'm trying to sleep over here.
[218:54.19]Baldo.
[218:54.83]No.
[218:55.35]I'll see you guys.
[218:57.27]I have to do some stuff.
[218:59.89]So the next time you see me will probably be Monday.
[219:03.17]Monday I have... I actually have... I'm doing my ultrasound on Monday.
[219:08.31]So... I'll still be live on Monday.
[219:11.39]Monday after I go to the doctor's appointment.
[219:15.79]They need to look at my... They're looking at my gallbladder is what they do.
[219:21.01]My mother had her gallbladder removed.
[219:23.75]And so I'm having like abdominal problems.
[219:27.33]And they think that it might be that.
[219:30.06]I don't know.
[219:31.64]We'll see.
[219:32.73]But I will stream after that.
[219:34.23]That's going to happen earlier in the day.
[219:36.91]I don't think... I might have to stream later around like 3 or 4.
[219:43.33]Just because I'll be there at the appointment earlier in the afternoon.
[219:47.41]Is your gallbladder a boy or a girl?
[219:52.73]But!
[219:53.82]Thank you again for watching.
[219:55.40]Pretty good turnout.
[219:56.30]I'm glad everybody thought it was fun.
[219:58.08]I did.
[219:58.50]I thought it was fucking hilarious.
[220:00.08]And awe-inspiring.
[220:03.14]So, my fucking gallbladder.
[220:06.84]We are going to move out to here.
[220:10.49]Does it work?
[220:10.97]Does it work?
[220:11.39]Does it work?
[220:12.35]I think so.
[220:15.33]And one.
[220:17.07]No!
[220:17.57]No!
[220:18.41]No, it's still me.
[220:19.71]Why is it still me?
[220:23.47]It shouldn't be still me.
[220:25.62]I thought I fixed it.
[220:28.74]Fucking egomaniac.
[220:31.62]I know, seriously.
[220:32.46]God damn it.
[220:36.78]I had mine removed.
[220:37.54]It feels better, but you have to be careful with those cheeseburgers.
[220:40.50]Yeah, I'll... Do what you gotta do, you know?
[220:43.74]We're not even 100% sure that's what's going on, but they just want to check it.
[220:48.35]So this is not legit, so... We're gonna take those off.
[220:51.95]I thought I fixed this.
[220:54.55]But yeah, I'll see you guys on Monday.
[220:56.45]Have a fantastic weekend.

[223:27.50]But you and this whole community have helped me get a more positive outlook on life.
[223:32.45]And I can never thank you all enough.
[223:35.97]It's really great to hear.
[223:39.69]Stuff like this is just... It's why I wanted to do more of these types of things.
[223:46.27]It's fun to collectively... Come together and look at stuff.
[223:52.90]Feels pretty good.
[223:55.82]I also love iPods.
[224:01.50]Thank you, though.
[224:03.52]I can't see the top donators.
[224:04.52]Yeah, I know, something's... I... I don't know why that's here, but it is.
[224:11.34]It's... I... I need to, like... Streamlabs OBS has this thing where it says the sessions, right?
[224:19.21]So I have, for a source, it's the sessions top subgifter.
[224:24.13]Doesn't that mean the stream session?
[224:26.03]So why does this not work half the time?
[224:30.23]It doesn't make any sense.
[224:35.58]Is it not pulling it from Twitch's end somehow?
[224:37.38]But it's a Streamlabs thing.
[224:38.83]I don't know.
[224:44.63]Maybe it's from the stuff from today.
[224:46.05]But it didn't work a few days ago either.
[224:48.91]Twitch has had zero viewers right now.
[224:50.71]Somebody's panicking in that office.
[224:53.45]At the Twitch office.
[224:56.68]Papers are flying around probably.
[224:59.02]Like three people got fired or something.
[225:00.70]It's just like, who did it?
[225:11.84]The alarms are going off.
[225:15.77]Zero views.
[225:20.53]But thank you, iPod Matt.
[225:21.35]Appreciate it.
[225:23.83]SFC100, thanks for the 500 bits.
[225:25.85]Pledging bits to your channel, Jerma.
[225:27.79]I tell you the exact amount, but I skipped Algebra 2, Episode 4.
[225:30.69]I thought it was a clip show.
[225:38.38]102 episode 4.
[225:39.48]That's perfect.
[225:40.80]I love that.
[225:42.44]Thank you.
[225:46.78]KXE gave 2500 bits a couple hours ago.
[225:53.42]Thank you.
[225:55.09]There's no message, just 2500 bits, $25.
[225:56.39]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[226:04.38]Phylactery Lich gave 5,000 bits and said this is basically Jex.
[226:08.10]I said I was going to watch it later.
[226:11.99]So that's what we're going to do.
[226:12.91]Maybe get it on screen.
[226:30.78]Hi guys.
[226:32.32]I thought it was going to be a web browser.
[226:35.47]Turns out it's not.
[226:38.05]It's just me and my fucking, like, just candid face.
[226:43.58]Uh, okay.
[226:46.60]Now you should see something on the screen.
[226:48.46]This is basically Jex.
[226:55.70]He shoots!
[226:56.48]He scores!
[226:57.16]Neutron is definitely...
[227:08.75]Looking good.
[227:09.55]You're the man, dude.
[227:10.39]You're the man.
[227:11.91]This is real.
[227:13.13]This is dumb.
[227:14.13]Neutron, what are you doing?
[227:16.37]I'm walking here.
[227:17.29]You got a problem with that skateboard boy?
[227:19.77]Uh, skateboard boy?
[227:29.50]Oh, check it out.
[227:30.62]Neutron has the moves.
[227:33.02]Well, how about next time you get a boy that can handle the Neutron style?
[227:36.90]Later, Nicorama!
[227:38.22]Alright, that was the coolest Jimmy Neutron ever.
[227:47.72]It's supposed to be John Travolta.
[227:50.24]Somebody just said, what an awful show.
[228:01.08]It's not, it's not.
[228:04.16]Jimmy Neutron was great.
[228:05.91]What's wrong with Jimmy Neutron?
[228:10.39]That was a good show, wasn't it?
[228:12.80]Wasn't it?
[228:14.44]Was that a good show, wasn't it?
[228:16.34]Was it?
[228:19.84]Hey, Tar, Alec, and thanks for the 700 bits.
[228:25.77]And your 36th straight month as a sub.
[228:31.39]They actually say it right here.
[228:32.99]Jeremy, it's my 36th month sub anniversary this month.
[228:35.96]You're an amazing streamer.
[228:37.18]Thanks for all the fantastic content.
[228:39.00]The community you built here is truly one of the best on Twitch.
[228:41.72]And that's right, chat.
[228:42.90]I love you guys.
[228:44.25]P.S.
[228:45.23]Can you please upload a new badge for three-year subs so I don't get confused with these worthless two-year pleb bandwagon sub losers?
[228:59.77]Well, uh... Thank you for the 700 bits and 33 years of
[229:15.53]I really appreciate that.
[229:17.11]I'm gonna have a bunch of new stuff put on the channel.
[229:20.99]You'll see some more stuff soon.
[229:24.31]It's gonna get weird.
[229:25.11]Am I gonna have to do three, four, five, six years?
[229:29.09]Seven years?
[229:31.29]Holy shit, can you imagine that?
[229:34.69]I never thought anyone would stay subbed for more than six months, let alone three plus years.
[229:39.93]So thank you.
[229:41.11]But yes, you can expect there to be more sub badges soon.
[229:49.18]Thanks a lot.
[229:49.58]Appreciate that.
[229:51.88]Hey, it's Garfield the Monday Killer.
[229:54.95]Thanks, Garfield.
[229:55.53]Good to see you again.
[229:58.23]Thanks for the $2.50.
[230:00.17]Glad you liked my Garf colla- my Garf collage collage, Jerma.
[230:05.00]Even if Garf doesn't do Garfographs anymore, you can count on fun Garf content every Community Night stream.
[230:11.02]I still gotta hook you in to join my new animated movie.
[230:14.92]He said you MIGHT join.
[230:17.37]I know just how the tip scales, I couldn't get it done for this stream, but next time you'll get an exclusive trailer and a real Garfield face reveal!
[230:24.49]Don't I already know what Garfield's face looks like?
[230:30.78]He's everywhere.
[230:35.69]How's that for a Garfagraph?
[230:36.65]Can you tell Garf when the next Community Night stream is so I have the trailer ready?
[230:40.69]Probably, I would say somewhere between 30 and 40 days from right now.
[230:43.95]Month to month.
[230:49.15]Here's the thing with projects.
[230:51.79]I am currently working on two at the moment right now.
[230:57.81]Remember I told you guys before the carnival happened that there were going to be more of those very, very quickly.
[231:08.32]So you can expect that.
[231:11.82]Every couple months, every two or three months, there's going to be something like that on this channel.
[231:18.02]Not carnivals, just bigger streams that I want to plan and spend a lot of time on.
[231:25.67]Two of them are already being worked on right now.
[231:27.93]One very much in particular is already in the pre-planning stages and is hopefully about two months away.
[231:37.61]Maybe a little bit more depending on time.
[231:48.51]Potentially really exciting stuff in the future.
[231:51.57]We'll see.
[231:53.11]I'm just keeping my mind open, you know.
[231:58.74]But look for the next community night somewhere in November, like the first week of November, maybe.
[232:04.78]Something like that.
[232:08.96]Thanks a lot, CarpeLupo.
[232:12.34]Hey, Appleshift, thanks for the 250 bits.
[232:13.82]Hey, man, I'm so insanely happy that you like my drawings.
[232:17.02]They were awesome.
[232:18.24]Thank you so much for the kind words.
[232:19.50]I've got many more on the way and can't wait for you to see them during the next community stream.
[232:23.99]Very talented, so thank you so much.
[232:29.62]I missed these from before, but I am whiz bang.
[232:34.08]Gave 20 community subs.
[232:36.36]I am whiz.
[232:37.44]Thank you.
[232:40.97]20 subs.
[232:42.27]And then AdventureMFDamn, we got you, but you gave 5 community subs as well.
[232:46.97]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[232:49.17]It's a shitload of subs.
[232:52.37]It is a lot.
[232:54.95]Appreciate every single one.
[232:59.74]Thank you to I'd Everagree for the 300 bits.
[233:05.66]Jerma just wanted to say, what's up?
[233:06.74]I finally got an interview for my first job and I'm super nervous, but I'm finally becoming a big boy.
[233:12.96]Finally becoming a big boy.
[233:15.80]There you go.
[233:16.92]Congratulations.
[233:19.59]Get that job.
[233:21.85]Go for it.
[233:23.59]Don't be nervous.
[233:25.41]You're going to do just fine.
[233:30.01]Good luck.
[233:32.18]Whatever it is, hope you get it.
[233:36.72]You've got to be nervous.
[233:37.50]Remember, this is something that you want.
[233:41.52]This is something that you want to do.
[233:43.95]So grab it.
[233:48.17]Good luck, though.
[233:51.94]Thank you to GooseCab for the 250 bits.
[233:53.34]Hey, Jerma, I'm so glad you like my two home run videos so much.
[233:57.77]I didn't even expect you to show the Ortiz Grand Slam again, but I'm glad you did.
[234:02.07]Thanks for showing my content on stream, and I hope you continue streaming for a long time.
[234:06.49]They're just, they were great.
[234:08.35]They were fucking hilarious.
[234:10.55]So, absolutely.
[234:12.67]Something about just superimposed on top of, like, Red Sox World Series wins and playoff victories is just hilarious to me.
[234:24.18]So thank you.
[234:25.27]My pleasure.
[234:29.21]Dr. Zoot Suit, thank you for the 500 bits.
[234:31.69]Jerma, you didn't read the short story I submitted for the community night.
[234:36.09]Short story?
[234:42.38]Short story.
[234:43.14]Let me see.
[234:52.01]Because I was just pulling images out of here.
[234:53.59]Was there text in here?
[234:54.63]Hold on.
[235:18.93]Oh, there is something right here.
[235:25.76]Let's add text-to-speech.
[235:26.68]Read this right now.
[235:37.07]Join the Discord if you're not.
[235:38.07]That's how you can submit things.
[235:50.13]Okay, here we go.
[235:53.69]This is a... This is a short story.
[235:59.37]I believe this is an... This looks like an... Oh, this has a spoiler.
[236:02.67]I don't want to read that.
[236:04.05]Alright, let's see.
[236:07.75]I'll turn the music off for this one.
[236:11.54]Hold on.
[236:13.26]This is going to be faster, I think.
[236:19.04]That's good right there.
[236:19.68]Alright, here we go.
[236:20.42]Elbertson, would you tell Drive Horowitz what you told me?
[236:25.35]About what?
[236:26.19]About the voices.
[236:27.87]The wild-looking man in the orange jumpsuit looked around nervously, his eyes darting over the room.
[236:34.61]Yes, Jeremy.
[236:36.22]The voices.
[236:37.58]Came the soothing reply of Dr. Nelson, resisting the urge to roll her eyes.
[236:43.86]she was a professional and she had seen far stranger than this she kept telling herself she wasn't going to let someone like this break her composure Dr. horowitz Saturday silently staring across his desk drive nelson and the patient Jeremy as he had been introduced
[237:04.49]Well, geez, gosh, I mean the voices.
[237:07.97]Jeremy laughed, eyes bugging slightly.
[237:10.95]They're just voices.
[237:12.65]You know, a couple of them.
[237:14.70]Not that big a deal.
[237:15.86]Jeremy has apparently experienced over 11,000 voices speaking to him at once.
[237:22.83]Jeremy Winster's the words left drive.
[237:25.71]Nelson's mouth but drive.
[237:27.24]Horowitz, D-I-D-N-T, react at first.
[237:30.64]11,000.
[237:31.34]Yes, sir.
[237:34.45]No, that's crazy.
[237:36.09]That's the sort of thing a crazy person would say.
[237:40.19]I'm not crazy Jeremy sit down Jeremy hyperventilating a little Saturday back down in the folding chair tell me Mr. elbertson what do these voices say Jeremy remained silent and eventually drive nelson spoke up it depends sir but they seem malevolent malevolent they encourage dangerous behavior they award him points for it
[238:08.42]points when he hurts people breaks things makes good jokes they give him points points and they take them away for wholesome behavior and bad jokes I see do they do anything else they like to all at once Jeremy leapt to his feet clutching his head and screaming
[238:29.40]Will you all shut up?
[238:31.32]Stop talking about my feet.
[238:33.70]Shut the fuck up.
[238:35.30]Get off this topic.
[238:36.99]No more feet.
[238:38.57]Before either doctor could attempt to pacify him, the door to the office slammed open and security guards charged in to restrain the screaming man.
[238:46.53]Stop saying it!
[238:52.10]Uh, oh, the big punch?
[238:53.68]The big punchline got cut off!
[238:57.32]Here's the big punch.
[238:58.66]Right here.
[239:00.95]Why did this get cut off?
[239:05.34]Listen.
[239:05.78]As he was hauled away, drive.
[239:08.30]Nelson sighed.
[239:09.98]I'm sorry, sir.
[239:11.06]Both SCP-985 and its host can be rather unpredictable.
[239:16.31]There you go.
[239:19.87]SCP-985.
[239:22.83]There's your punchline there.
[239:25.87]Alright, we're gonna do the credits.
[239:27.11]The actual credits are gonna be actually probably right in front of my face.
[239:30.95]How do we get them here?
[239:31.73]Let's see.
[239:33.19]Well, we can go like this.
[239:34.33]Are they going to be in front of me?
[239:35.07]Or are they going to be behind me?
[239:37.27]We'll find out.
[239:39.37]Chat's the true monster.
[239:43.13]Eh, debatable.
[239:44.82]I think that's debatable.
[239:47.98]Alright, am I... Are they in front of me or behind me?
[239:50.40]Let's find out.
[239:52.50]Thanks, everybody, for your support on these streams.
[239:57.96]They're in front of me.
[239:59.75]All these people subbed today during the stream, whether it was from a community sub or not.
[240:07.23]Or you just decided to stay subbed for 36 months in a row.
[240:11.74]Thank you.
[240:13.62]All of you.
[240:14.70]Here you all are.
[240:18.16]Hell yeah.
[240:18.66]Thanks a lot.
[240:20.59]We do have a few more bits to do, though.
[240:23.45]Which they're over here.
[240:24.90]I'll put them on a different screen.
[240:27.44]We had... That was Dr. Zoot Suit, by the way, for that story.
[240:31.74]Thanks for the story.
[240:32.46]Sorry I missed it.
[240:33.60]When I was pulling stuff out, I just was going to go in line by line, like videos and pictures.
[240:38.06]I didn't see it.
[240:39.16]I mean, I just kind of scrolled by it, apparently.
[240:42.59]It was very, very, very, very creepy.
[240:45.55]And it was a little twisted.
[240:47.35]But thank you.
[240:48.35]And thanks for your 500 bits, too.
[240:50.56]gtx 1080 quad sli gave 250 bits they say uh why don't you do more things with Etalyx um we we just did something like last week we're just a Twitch con but to answer that a greater question there I don't do very much collaborations anyways I think
[241:15.79]I kind of just, it's just me, you know?
[241:17.83]And if organically, if you want to do a video or a stream together, I don't, uh, I don't typically do the co-streams or multiplayer streams sometimes, but for the most part, it just, if it makes sense, then yeah, then hell yeah.
[241:35.26]But I typically just do my own thing.
[241:39.11]Typically.
[241:40.74]And yes, I have seen the birthday card.
[241:42.06]It was fucking incredibly wholesome and wonderful.
[241:45.08]Thank you.
[241:46.40]We went over it.
[241:48.02]I'm completely floored that there's that many people that want to say that fucking nice things about me.
[241:54.24]So, I really appreciate it.
[241:59.58]Words seriously cannot describe the feeling when I look at stuff like that.
[242:04.55]But, no, to answer the larger question, like I said, I get questions like a lot about, hey, you should play with Star some more.
[242:11.44]You should go, what about like Krikan and like Etalyx?
[242:13.82]You should play with Vinny or Joel.
[242:15.60]And they kind of just, it has to just sort of happen.
[242:19.04]Like I did, it's not like, I don't typically go out of my way to do much multiplayer kind of content with people.
[242:28.59]And that's sort of just...
[242:31.10]I guess I've been doing that for, like, the last five years or so.
[242:34.84]Kind of.
[242:38.04]You should play with Ninja.
[242:43.94]Why did I even read that out loud?
[242:48.22]Why did I read that?
[242:49.22]Vinny said you peed your pants and he doesn't need that kind of attention.
[243:02.90]I did not pee my pants.
[243:08.61]This song makes me sad.
[243:09.71]Why does this song make you sad?
[243:15.01]Still hasn't streamed with Joel.
[243:19.08]It just has to happen.
[243:21.22]You know what I mean?
[243:21.76]Like, it... There's been a... Well, that's not true.
[243:25.20]That's not true.
[243:27.44]We did the whole Vine Wrestle.
[243:28.66]That was a whole thing.
[243:33.19]No, yeah, that counts.
[243:34.11]Yeah, of course it does.
[243:41.41]But, I typically just kind of do my own thing.
[243:48.83]That's kind of the shrug.
[243:53.31]You have to take the initiative.
[243:56.68]But, I kind of just do my own thing.
[244:01.38]And I just bumped you.
[244:03.00]Bumped you in the face.
[244:06.00]That's a big gamer shrug.
[244:07.42]To be honest, you're much better as a solo act.
[244:15.45]Um... I don't... I don't know if I necessarily agree with that.
[244:21.21]But... I'm like at my most comfortable when I can kind of just do whatever and kind of say whatever and just kind of just be me.
[244:33.50]I've actually had this conversation before about why won't you do this or why don't you go play with that group or this group.
[244:38.52]It's because maybe I am a little more comfortable solo.
[244:43.97]Maybe it is.
[244:44.41]Maybe that is what it is.
[244:51.51]And, you know, obviously with all of you.
[244:57.30]I prefer solo less to comprehend from my tiny brain.
[245:03.68]My tiny brain.
[245:08.32]But, I don't know, sometimes stuff just randomly comes up.
[245:09.92]Like, for instance, Star and Terraria.
[245:12.28]It was just like... There was no plan there.
[245:16.03]It wasn't like, oh, we're going to do this.
[245:17.47]We should do this.
[245:18.11]We should do this more often.
[245:19.25]It was just like, I want to fucking play Terraria and you do too.
[245:23.81]Let's do it.
[245:24.35]Let's just play.
[245:24.81]Let's beat it.
[245:27.83]That's just kind of how it works.
[245:29.73]And that's how it will continue to work.
[245:34.08]Okay, yes.
[245:34.36]Wait, what did he say?
[245:38.37]jermaSour.
[245:41.27]Oh yeah, I didn't put that.
[245:42.33]It's been 24 hours.
[245:43.53]No, it's not.
[245:44.93]I have like four hours to put jermaSour as an emote.
[245:52.88]But let's finish this up.
[245:54.80]Let's get to the end.
[245:55.86]We are at the end.
[245:57.46]And that means we switch over to the real end.
[246:02.63]This one.
[246:07.46]We have... 250 from Gnarly at the end here.
[246:11.44]Thank you.
[246:12.06]Thanks for showing my Soul Calibur glue man on stream.
[246:14.02]I don't know if I uploaded it right.
[246:16.02]But that was supposed to be a whole photo album of characters.
[246:19.52]Regardless, happy to have my shitty glue man next to some really high quality fan art.
[246:22.68]Really fun stream.
[246:26.66]That was great.
[246:27.72]I don't think other ones popped up, but it was still awesome.
[246:33.56]It was still very, very, very good.
[246:36.31]Good shit.
[246:36.75]I didn't even know that had that good of a character creator until somebody told me about it.
[246:40.09]I was like, damn.
[246:41.61]Cool.
[246:41.85]But no, it was great.
[246:45.17]FreudianWeapon, thanks for the $2.50.
[246:46.13]This community content is a great idea.
[246:48.35]I'll definitely make some art for the next one.
[246:50.95]And good luck with the doctors.
[246:51.89]Be well.
[246:54.03]I'm gonna try.
[246:58.28]I am gonna try.
[246:59.56]That's all you can do.
[247:02.40]I'm not too concerned about it.
[247:05.36]But, there has been just a random nagging issue.
[247:11.34]That has been around for a while, and it's not anything to do with my intestinal problems.
[247:15.56]At least, not that I've been... Because I had the colonoscopy, remember?
[247:19.57]That was because of these symptoms.
[247:23.91]So, I wanted to check on a few things.
[247:27.09]And just keep going, see what the hell's going on.
[247:31.93]But, I mean, I feel fine.
[247:32.87]I'm okay.
[247:33.16]I'm fine.
[247:33.84]I'm not sick or anything.
[247:34.74]Like, I'm just...
[247:36.72]There's something going on internally there that once I find out what the hell it is, just do it.
[247:44.09]Figure it out.
[247:46.43]I'm not concerned.
[247:49.93]Do I have a FODMAP problem?
[247:51.53]That's what they thought it was at first, but I'm not sure that's what it is.
[247:56.44]I get, like, this bad abdominal pain that sits, like, under my rib cage.
[248:00.88]Like, on my right side.
[248:02.60]And it's kind of right in the center.
[248:05.02]So they just want to do an ultrasound on gallbladder and just check out the organs.
[248:09.28]Just make sure they're all working properly.
[248:12.49]So.
[248:15.27]And it's peace of mind, too, just to make sure, you know.
[248:20.29]I want to stay on top of it, I guess.
[248:23.00]But thank you, Frodeon.
[248:24.28]Balla Koala, thank you for the thousand bits.
[248:26.17]Play more NGU.
[248:31.41]That's a great game, but I don't think you'll see that on stream anymore.
[248:35.53]We hit him too hard with the frog.
[248:39.89]Could be irritable bowel syndrome.
[248:41.03]Well, I have irritable bowel disease.
[248:44.41]I was diagnosed with colitis like 10 years ago or so.
[248:48.51]Maybe a little bit more, like 12 years ago.
[248:51.58]But the symptoms are different.
[248:55.34]They're not the ones that I'm typically used to.
[249:02.85]We'll figure it out.
[249:04.41]But you won't see that on stream anymore.
[249:06.83]It's a great game, but I probably will move on from it.
[249:11.52]But thanks for the thousand bits.
[249:12.62]Appreciate it.
[249:13.12]Valakuala.
[249:15.54]Also, C4G, thanks for the 250.
[249:17.48]Hey, Jerma, I did the Ace Attorney video.
[249:20.85]I had a bit I wanted to include where the judge bangs the gavel on the emote only button, but I was in a rush to finish it in time and forgot to include it.
[249:30.58]I'm glad people seem to like the video even if you won't admit to your crimes.
[249:36.40]That's fucking funny.
[249:39.52]That's fucking funny.
[249:45.70]But it still was great regardless of any finishing touches.
[249:49.33]So thank you so much for that.
[249:50.79]It was fantastic.
[249:54.09]Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the 250.
[249:55.79]Hey, Jerma, when you were talking about taxes and whatnot, I immediately thought of this.
[249:59.25]What?
[250:01.33]What?
[250:17.62]What?
[250:17.82]Taxes?
[250:19.04]Taxes?
[250:19.46]Oh, well.
[250:21.34]Okay.
[250:21.62]Is this from Repo Man?
[250:22.74]No.
[250:45.83]Click on the album.
[250:46.49]Click on the album.
[250:47.07]Hold on.
[250:47.33]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[250:52.68]Hold on.
[250:54.64]Don't click on the album.
[250:55.94]Why?
[250:57.40]Why, why, why, why, why, what, what?
[250:58.92]What's in it?
[250:59.28]What's in it?
[250:59.72]What's in it?
[251:00.14]What's in it?
[251:04.75]What'd you make me click on?
[251:07.91]One fucking guy.
[251:09.07]Dribble one fucking guy.
[251:11.83]It's just a one guy.
[251:15.71]Oh, I see the album now.
[251:16.61]Hold on, we'll go through this in a second.
[251:17.61]I just want to get to the end of the bits.
[251:19.07]There's only two more.
[251:21.05]Two more bits.
[251:22.63]Two more bits.
[251:28.42]And they are.
[251:29.40]That was from Superintendent Chalmers.
[251:33.28]Silent Serenity, thanks for the $2.50 Silent Serenity right now.
[251:36.65]Jerma, I'm not sure if I've told this story before, but I'm going to since I was reminded of it anyways.
[251:42.13]Years ago when I was still in high school, I had to write a play for English class.
[251:46.96]So what did I write about?
[251:47.82]The egg, of course.
[251:50.36]I adapted the original egg video into my script.
[251:53.80]My teacher loved it, so I hope you don't mind that I plagiarized.
[251:58.89]What did you get for a grade?
[252:04.23]Did you get an A?
[252:06.21]Because that's only okay if you got an A. If you got a C- or worse, then that would upset me a little because that means that that teacher doesn't understand true artwork.
[252:29.98]It's below average.
[252:42.06]Because it's true art is what that is But phylactery gave another five thousand bits May as well be five thousand dollars at this point total Thank you phylactery
[253:03.88]This is another video here.
[253:05.01]It's another Jimmy Neutron video.
[253:10.85]How do you have all these Jimmy Neutron clips just ready to go?
[253:13.57]Where are you getting the Jimmy Neutron clips?
[253:40.70]oh hi Jimmy um I have to do a report on snails or napoleon can you help me what's the point of doing homework we do it and then what poof we're gone nothingness emptiness we're all just dust in the wind okay I I don't want to be dust in the wind is that from the thing we were talking about is this when when they when they they he got like he got like clipped into like five different Jimmy neutrons

[254:09.27]Like I said, every cartoon has done that.
[254:14.35]Thanks a lot, Jimmy.
[254:16.06]Well, not Jimmy Neutron.
[254:17.76]Jimmy Neutron did not give me that clip.
[254:24.18]I misclicked.
[254:25.30]Hold on.
[254:31.08]I'm going to go back over here.

[255:32.50]That's on the stream dashboard.
[255:35.52]That's incorrect.
[255:36.92]I don't know where it's pulling that from.
[255:48.41]Password leaked.
[255:49.49]This is just like the stream bits.
[255:54.23]This is from the jermaMustard site.
