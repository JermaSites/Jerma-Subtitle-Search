[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.99]Oh, you can hear me!
[00:04.84]I'm just sitting there, like, silent on my phone, tweeting.
[00:08.00]I'm just like, I'm muted, whatever.
[00:14.51]That's why I always have the mic muted.
[00:16.21]Because I'm just sitting there like... Okay.
[00:21.75]But hey, how you doing?
[00:22.77]How's everybody doing?
[00:23.99]Sorry for the delay.
[00:25.83]There was a lot of strange technical issues.
[00:30.55]Etalyx had problems with his capture card.
[00:32.38]The lobby system in the game is really, really strange.
[00:37.70]It's kind of a weird roundabout system in EDF5 to play together and joining off of each other's sessions and stuff.
[00:45.08]It's very odd.
[00:46.16]But Earth Defense Force 5...
[00:50.70]Today.
[00:51.20]Tonight.
[00:52.56]And depending on how much fun this game is, you may see it again.
[00:56.04]Because... I was a huge fan of the last one.
[01:01.36]Played it at least three or four times on stream.
[01:03.20]And I played a shitload of it off stream, too.
[01:06.96]So, without further ado, because we've been kind of sticking around and waiting around, I think we're pretty much ready to go.
[01:15.23]Let's go ahead and see who's available here to speak.
[01:19.91]I wonder who's here.
[01:24.45]Hello there.
[01:25.23]Anybody there?
[01:29.92]Hello there.
[01:30.92]Hello there.
[01:31.54]I'm here.
[01:32.60]Are you eating?
[01:33.10]We're going to have to wait like 15 minutes because I just got food.
[01:37.06]What did you get?
[01:38.27]Sounds good.
[01:39.81]What food did you get?
[01:42.01]It's, you know, rice and vegetables and pork.
[01:45.75]Okay.
[01:47.24]But is it... Did you make it yourself or was it... Ashley made it for me.
[01:52.08]Okay.
[01:53.50]Nice.
[01:53.94]Okay.
[01:54.66]Sounds delicious.
[01:55.08]She beat me because I'm an imbecile.
[01:59.64]I mean, I don't know what to do with that.
[02:01.25]You know what I mean?
[02:04.23]I don't know how to spell it out for us.
[02:06.85]Well...
[02:07.82]Now we can start- I can eat and play, because I'm a god gamer.
[02:10.80]Because I'd run a start, because we're an hour late because of you.
[02:14.62]As always.
[02:15.52]Hey!
[02:15.86]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:17.49]There were- Excuse me.
[02:19.01]Hey, there were a lot of problems.
[02:21.97]Yes, Etalyx' capture card got fucked up, but he doesn't have control over that.
[02:26.37]And you couldn't figure out how to add friends.
[02:28.47]And you couldn't figure out how to invite me to a lobby.
[02:32.81]Beyond that, I wasn't told that Baby's eating schedule-
[02:36.24]Uh, was happening beforehand, so I didn't know to prepare ahead for dinner.
[02:42.00]Alright, that's it!
[02:42.62]Pretty good.
[02:43.26]Stream over!
[02:45.22]I'm gonna go play- I'm gonna go count peanuts down the street or something.
[02:50.82]Every time you beat Katamari, you grow one centimeter.
[02:55.45]Did I just turn my- I'm like naked, and I think I just accidentally turned my webcam on.
[02:59.75]Did I do that?
[03:01.43]No, I didn't.
[03:02.13]Thank God.
[03:04.53]Are you naked?
[03:06.01]I don't wear clothes.
[03:08.85]Etalyx, we live together.
[03:10.91]Can you please vouch for me?
[03:12.47]Why do I need someone to vouch for me for this?
[03:14.37]Hey, dude, can you like vouch for me, man?
[03:15.55]I don't wear clothes, right?
[03:19.60]You don't wear clothes?
[03:20.52]Is that what you were asking me right now?
[03:22.74]I want you to confirm or deny the fact that how often do I wear clothes?
[03:26.68]Is this really the question you want to be asking me right now?
[03:28.82]I really want to know.
[03:30.16]Can you give like an example, Etalyx?
[03:32.04]Give us an example.
[03:33.26]When did you first find out he doesn't wear clothes?
[03:36.18]Um, before we even moved, he was like, by the way, I don't wear clothes.
[03:39.94]I'm gonna have to start wearing clothes now.
[03:42.12]That was the first thing he said.
[03:47.02]It was pretty immediate.
[03:48.64]Like full nude or like boxers or underwear?
[03:51.14]Well, obviously I've never seen the full nude, but I was told the stories.
[03:57.12]No, listen.
[03:58.88]All I said was this.
[03:59.82]I said, I just want to make sure that you're... I want to make sure that... Are you okay with this?
[04:03.24]Are you okay with me walking around shirtless?
[04:05.27]Like, are you okay with that?
[04:06.55]Like, is that okay?
[04:07.91]And he was like, yeah, of course it's fine.
[04:08.85]I've seen you shirtless.
[04:09.69]Yeah.
[04:11.39]I can vouch for this, actually.
[04:12.41]Because now that I think about it, you take your shirt off whenever you get the chance.
[04:17.69]No, but I just... The opposite of a never nude.
[04:21.00]No, it's good.
[04:21.56]You're very comfortable that way.
[04:23.02]Like, a lot of people would be shy taking their shirt off in front of other people.
[04:25.90]But, like, you...
[04:27.71]You push past that.
[04:30.50]It's like a sweaty comfort thing.
[04:33.36]And I make sure I'm... Okay, if I told you that, Alex, before we moved in, and you were like, nah, man, I don't like that, I would wear, like, a fucking shirt.
[04:43.93]I want to make sure that you were like, okay, like you cool with me like hanging out like on the couch, like no clothes on, like no shirt on.
[04:50.65]I mentioned I never go swimming.
[04:52.07]Like I never go to the pool.
[04:53.19]I've never seen another human being.
[04:55.37]No, the amount of times that we've like shared a hotel room and you're like, oh, I'm going to take a shower.
[04:59.33]You just take your shirt off and then you start another conversation and stand there shirtless for 10 minutes.
[05:03.57]This is how fan fiction starts.
[05:05.37]Every time.
[05:07.40]That's not every time.
[05:10.30]Probably every time we've had a hotel together.
[05:12.58]It's happened at least once.
[05:13.48]I'm going to need to install Microsoft Word after this.
[05:19.95]And you get really weird.
[05:22.31]Towards the end of the conversation, you like flex an arm and kiss it.
[05:27.77]Alright.
[05:28.13]Alright.
[05:28.43]It's time.
[05:29.93]Are we ready to play the game?
[05:31.80]Yeah.
[05:32.52]I think we're finally ready to play.
[05:35.16]Hey, welcome to EDF5.
[05:39.12]We're doing the first mission.
[05:43.90]Are we?
[05:44.80]Should I start?
[05:46.19]I mean, you're the guy with the fork and knife in his hand.
[05:51.11]I'm eating with a chapstick.
[05:51.79]What the fuck are you writing here?
[05:53.47]Oh, we are the Valiant infantry.
[05:54.79]We are the Alpha team with passion.
[05:57.02]Nice, that was a great... Are you writing this?
[05:59.02]I keep trying to change controls.
[06:00.84]Like, oh, go to prepare and then complete the mission.
[06:03.32]But I'm using the D-pad.
[06:05.00]If you touch the D-pad...
[06:07.60]Oh, I thought you were actually typing this stuff in being, like, weird.
[06:14.03]Okay, okay.
[06:15.43]Yeah, I mean, like, I'm saying okay.
[06:17.83]How do you ready?
[06:20.05]Preparation complete.
[06:23.03]Alright, so let's go over our classes.
[06:25.61]No, what?
[06:26.47]No, it was a collective... It was a collective... Star couldn't figure out how to use the PlayStation.
[06:37.68]It was also the last one to use the bathroom, and he's eating right now.
[06:40.98]Yeah, and by the way, when we used to have hotel rooms... Yeah, he used to eat in the bathroom.
[06:52.21]He used to bring... I do that.
[06:53.91]You're right next to basically... Yeah, you're next to the toilet.
[06:56.51]By not getting two coins, just one was enough.
[06:59.45]So you don't have to use trash bags if you eat next to the toilet?
[07:04.49]No, you would sit there with the fork and knife of the plate on the toilet and it was just, it was chaos.
[07:11.92]You would leave trash around, you would just, by the way, the shower drain is not a garbage disposal.
[07:17.66]You don't dump the leftover shit that you don't want to eat down there.
[07:20.26]I don't know why you would do that.
[07:21.18]Do you understand how much throughout my lifespan, how much plastic I've saved and how much I've helped the environment because I do that?
[07:28.13]By what?
[07:29.25]Doing what now putting fire down the sink alright?
[07:33.15]Yeah Alright there we go work fight the aliens guys stop stop talking I Just realized aim at the bugs, and then you shoot the bugs.
[07:49.62]Yeah, I know, but I've got like a mega shield oh
[07:52.37]I don't know what I do either, actually.
[07:54.17]Oh, I have this cannon.
[07:56.18]I've got Mega Bomb.
[07:56.86]Guys, stop throwing so much shade and look in the mirror.
[08:01.14]Look in the mirror, I cry for like an hour or two.
[08:04.32]That's why you never go into the hotel bathroom.
[08:07.46]Make sure you pick up the red cases.
[08:10.37]By the way, I'm coming to a realization that playing, like you said, Wing Diver on console is probably not a great idea.
[08:15.89]Yeah, I'm already using...
[08:19.15]Sad control scheme.
[08:20.87]I get to shoot a lot of bullets, so... Mine's working pretty good.
[08:25.19]Yeah.
[08:25.71]I mean, you're like slow and dumpy anyway.
[08:27.75]I am, yeah.
[08:28.45]I gotta figure out how to go fast.
[08:30.33]Alright, so, um... This is the one I need to be using.
[08:35.31]I need to be using the Plasma Cannon.
[08:36.97]For sure.
[08:39.87]More like Street Corridor Defense Force.
[08:42.63]This is just the first level.
[08:45.68]I put the bombs on you, Italic.
[08:47.69]So you have to go in.
[08:49.93]It's pointing the other direction.
[08:52.11]Guys, it's pointing the other direction.
[08:53.81]Hey, put the fucking food down!
[08:57.20]I was following you!
[08:59.14]There we go, that's the stuff.
[09:04.24]Okay.
[09:07.77]Guys, head to the ground surface.
[09:09.64]Yeah, look, have you got arrows?
[09:11.84]Yeah.
[09:12.40]Hurry up, guys.
[09:13.06]I mean, team leader.
[09:14.84]There's some way we have to go fight these dinosaurs.
[09:17.89]They're not dinosaurs.
[09:18.79]They're not fucking dinosaurs.
[09:21.69]Idiot!
[09:22.99]I just hurt myself in the other room.
[09:25.69]How?
[09:26.25]How is that possible?
[09:30.13]I just hurt myself in the other room.
[09:32.66]Did that just happen?
[09:34.86]Hey, what?
[09:36.29]You... How loud are you?
[09:37.79]I don't know.
[09:38.09]My headset might be too loud.
[09:39.49]Oh, okay.
[09:39.97]Definitely not me.
[09:40.91]Yeah.
[09:41.63]I've been meaning to get a new headset for a long time because my audio leaks.
[09:45.85]And you're a screamer.
[09:47.07]I know one thing about you.
[09:47.88]You're a screamer.
[09:48.36]Is there actually like a sprint button for me?
[09:51.04]Left L3.
[09:52.44]Well, actually, I think you get like a dash.
[09:54.94]And your dash... I think I can go.
[09:57.78]By the way, I'm definitely going to get all the points here.
[09:59.56]Yeah.
[10:00.27]I remember his dash being cancelable somewhere.
[10:02.49]So I don't know if that's still a thing for him.
[10:05.32]There's health containers too.
[10:06.78]Oh, you guys are just making it over here.
[10:13.21]Hey guys!
[10:14.67]Yeah, I know.
[10:15.11]I forgot about that.
[10:30.47]Also, my character only gets to shoot, like, once every five seconds, so... Oh yeah, you're using, like, the vehicle guy, right?
[10:38.93]Yeah.
[10:41.13]Do we get our own Diablo 3 loot systems, card looting system here, or is it... Am I picking these up?
[10:45.43]No.
[10:45.49]Like, if you pick up armor, you're taking it away from us.
[10:47.81]Am I, actually?
[10:48.51]And you're... Yeah, and you're gonna be picking it all up because you're way faster.
[10:51.71]Never gonna get loot.
[10:53.43]Oh, shit.
[10:53.91]Well, you just need to... Okay, good.
[10:57.29]Ooh, I can push the bugs around, it's got physics.
[10:59.23]Doesn't Fencer have a, um, a dash, like a, you go rocket feet?
[11:03.91]Yeah, I do that.
[11:04.73]I do that once.
[11:07.15]Armor is shared.
[11:10.47]Okay, we'll get there eventually.
[11:12.23]Alright, hey, hey, hey, the armor is shared.
[11:16.11]So, if somebody picks it up, it's shared between us all.
[11:19.35]Look at me just getting in there and just fucking lighting them up.
[11:22.75]Oh.
[11:25.06]Oh.
[11:29.96]Just defeat these enemies!
[11:32.84]I don't wanna die like that.
[11:42.07]Is health shared too, if I pick it up?
[11:43.31]Is it like, shared between everybody?
[11:46.79]Probably not.
[11:52.97]What did you just say?
[11:55.21]So it's not like I'm hurt or anything.
[11:57.75]Baka.
[11:58.65]Wait, what's the last part?
[12:03.01]Baka?
[12:03.97]It's a JoJo reference.
[12:05.53]Oh, okay.
[12:05.93]I don't know what those are.
[12:10.79]Is it in the hive?
[12:12.23]Oh, they're on the ceiling.
[12:14.99]Yeah.
[12:19.29]Can you kill them already?
[12:20.47]What do you think I'm trying?
[12:22.49]So what does Flyboy do?
[12:24.91]Mm-hmm.
[12:25.93]Me?
[12:26.21]What does your class do?
[12:27.39]Besides, like, glide?
[12:27.99]It's, like, rockets.
[12:29.39]Can you put these armors for us, then?
[12:31.71]Oh, fine, fine.
[12:32.75]I'll do everything.
[12:33.63]I'll do it all.
[12:37.06]So his armor, like, is that a permanent, like, increase?
[12:39.40]Yes.
[12:40.32]Yeah.
[12:40.76]It's a permanent increase.
[12:43.82]So if you don't like this character, then very soon you need to figure out if you want to switch.
[12:50.27]So there's four classes initially.
[12:52.23]What does that turn into by... Only four.
[12:54.81]Or is it the four?
[12:55.89]There's like a thousand weapons.
[12:56.65]It's always the four, but you unlock new weapons as you level up.
[13:00.32]And stuff like that.
[13:03.92]Yeah.
[13:04.82]There's only four classes, but there are hundreds and hundreds of weapons in the game.
[13:11.22]So it is not... Oh, only four classes.
[13:13.80]I get four abilities and an ultimate?
[13:15.66]Uh-uh.
[13:18.32]You get an ultimate.
[13:18.80]I don't know, why am I making like a MOBA reference?
[13:21.04]You don't even play those.
[13:21.72]I want an ultimate.
[13:24.92]I want to play this without a controller.
[13:26.08]It's not just MOBAs anymore.
[13:28.40]Every single game has an ultimate ability now.
[13:31.45]I mean, that's kind of true.
[13:34.91]You know what?
[13:36.01]I'll hear that and raise you on every game also including like a boxed open.
[13:43.31]Is there loot crates in this game?
[13:45.13]There are.
[13:45.59]Oh, we have to go to the other?
[13:46.35]Why does he keep jebaiting us?
[13:48.26]There are, because you can see I'm picking them up on the ground.
[13:50.56]They don't need to pay for them, though.
[13:55.12]So, can I get those on the free-to-play model?
[13:57.38]Yeah, well, it's free to play after you pay $60.
[14:01.93]Well, I paid $60.
[14:03.61]How many keys do I get?
[14:04.47]I don't know.
[14:06.15]A star knows that more than I do.
[14:11.49]The reason my star's not talking...
[14:15.84]You got like a piece of ham stuck in your throat or something there?
[14:18.72]No, you're doing that.
[14:20.46]No, I want you to eat with the mic on, so you can call out shots.
[14:24.14]It was very important.
[14:47.90]Oh, there's the dash.
[14:49.22]Oh yeah, and there are weapon boxes that you need to find.
[14:52.16]There we go.
[14:53.36]So here's a question for the chat room here.
[14:55.28]I think it's shared.
[14:57.85]Yeah, because I picked up at least three of them.
[14:59.85]So are they shared too?
[15:01.21]Shared.
[15:01.55]Good.
[15:02.07]Sick.
[15:02.73]Nice.
[15:06.67]I've never played this game before.
[15:11.33]Never.
[15:12.25]I figured out my dash.
[15:13.99]But so far the tutorial was definitely the best part.
[15:18.12]He started by complimenting me, like, oh, you can talk on the radio, and you can summon vehicles, and you can do all this.
[15:24.84]Someone must really trust you.
[15:26.19]You must be a high-ranked officer.
[15:28.23]And then he made me look left and right and told me I was impressive for doing it.
[15:32.83]Well, you got a participation award.
[15:34.53]Yeah.
[15:34.97]You just had to get a medal, so... Take the Boy Scouts.
[15:41.00]Watch out for monsters.
[15:42.14]Yeah, don't worry about stealing loot.
[15:43.34]Alright, that's cool.
[15:45.15]You guys point them out.
[15:46.97]I'll get up there and I'll fly up there.
[15:53.12]This base is too big for humans.
[15:55.50]It must be designed for mechas.
[15:58.34]I was about to say, basically the same thing.
[16:01.29]They made this facility exclusively so it could be invaded by Giant Ant.
[16:05.13]Yeah.
[16:07.79]But it's supposed to be like that.
[16:11.33]And don't worry, I'm gonna use the gun.
[16:12.93]I don't like EDF because it's bad.
[16:16.44]Because they say bad, dumb dialogue.
[16:20.90]That's part of the allure!
[16:24.84]That's part of the luster!
[16:28.53]Listen, they're singing.
[16:29.33]Be respectful.
[16:33.53]That's what your character does?
[16:35.83]You just have a big lunchbox?
[16:38.49]Oh yeah, I got lunchboxes.
[16:39.75]And inside the lunchboxes is a gun.
[16:48.25]Uh, how do you chant EDF?
[16:50.91]That just scared the shit out of me, what you just did.
[16:52.41]I thought you were nailing it.
[16:54.39]Do you have the, uh, the touchpad on PS4?
[16:57.53]Mhm.
[16:57.79]Yeah, you playing with motion control?
[16:58.71]That opens up a regular menu.
[16:59.56]Oh, there's that.
[17:02.05]Also, I think the D-pad has all the stuff in it.
[17:07.94]I think to do the whole song you need the... Why is your character's voice so much louder?
[17:16.76]EDF!
[17:17.48]I like your pink Power Ranger costume, by the way.
[17:22.74]It's the lore.
[17:23.45]Come on, guys.
[17:25.41]Don't you dare.
[17:26.43]I think my character has the least annoying voice in the game.
[17:29.07]That's part of the... Watch out!
[17:38.34]Oh my god, your gun looks like you're about to refuel a car.
[17:42.48]Gas pump?
[17:46.35]Also, you have high heels, which is really nice.
[17:48.85]But I fly.
[17:50.01]I fly.
[17:50.61]So why do you have high heels?
[17:52.43]To get up to the air quicker?
[17:53.65]I guess you never have to touch the ground, so they're very comfortable because he never has to walk.
[17:56.85]You don't know what those are.
[17:57.80]Those could be springboards.
[18:06.19]I don't like playing this character because when I fly in the air I don't hear all the fun dialogue.
[18:13.84]I don't hear all the fun dialogue.
[18:16.04]Because I'm too far away.
[18:18.40]Does it have simulated 5.1 surround sound, boys?
[18:21.28]No, it's... I'm just flying around, and I'm up in the air, and I can't hear what he's saying.
[18:26.85]I feel like I need to be part of the... I'm out of ammo.
[18:30.65]And everything.
[18:31.07]Can you just keep standing, EDF?
[18:33.25]No, I don't want to do that anymore.
[18:35.97]Thank you.
[18:39.15]Alright.
[18:39.93]Shout out Crates if you see him, because... I got nothing else to do while my gun reloads for 30 seconds.
[18:50.86]console controls, come on.
[18:54.48]That's why I'm playing Air Raider Man.
[18:57.16]Because vehicles don't feel like garbage to drive with a controller.
[19:00.56]So is Ranger the only one that can drive vehicles?
[19:03.02]Oh fuck, there are monsters.
[19:08.20]I was wondering that myself.
[19:09.24]I think I can drive them and Rangers can drive them.
[19:12.19]Yeah, you can spawn them.
[19:13.33]I think Rangers can also drive them.
[19:15.43]Yeah.
[19:18.37]So, like, Flyboy and you won't be able to use more healing.
[19:22.62]I am the healer.
[19:24.52]Nearly punished.
[19:28.00]That would be silly.
[19:32.74]Alright, shout out crates.
[19:34.32]I gotta eat this food.
[19:39.77]Will you stop eating?
[19:41.69]I haven't been eating.
[19:42.77]I don't see any extra crates.
[19:47.69]A fun-hating streamer refuses to spam voice lines.
[19:52.15]I'm a fun streamer, see?
[19:55.71]I'm a hilarious streamer, see?
[20:00.46]And I apologize to you guys, too.
[20:01.60]Alright, I think we've just beat level one.
[20:06.18]Quick, go into the light.
[20:11.22]He thinks if he doesn't get your attention with one type of voice, it'll change his tone.
[20:15.79]Help!
[20:17.40]We did it.
[20:20.75]Ladies and gentlemen, that is EDF.
[20:23.07]No, it's not.
[20:23.59]That's like bullshit.
[20:24.37]That was just like a shitty walk around in a hallway.
[20:25.99]Mission complete.
[20:26.77]Game's over.
[20:27.33]This is what you play for.
[20:33.36]So it looks like we got a missile launcher for the Ranger.
[20:36.60]Do we have the same screen?
[20:39.10]I think so, yeah.
[20:39.80]Just the total items acquired here.
[20:41.30]Look at all my items I get to use next round.
[20:45.13]You want a lot of new things are we sure Ranger are we sure everything?
[20:51.22]Alright short rain, I'm gonna take a look at those we got armor up Power lances in generic turn right guys.
[20:59.60]I got a bunker.
[21:00.64]Yeah, there's so much text Hold a little trigger to fire it power lances in short term Yeah, there's a lot to look at here
[21:13.96]I just look at what the numbers are, you know what I mean?
[21:16.30]Yeah, but there's a lot of numbers though.
[21:19.02]I know, but like... Yeah, like the rank of your equipment actually... Yeah.
[21:24.12]...is very important.
[21:26.76]So if you have like one that's a 4 and one that's a 0... Just charge the casket.
[21:31.14]It's a big deal.
[21:32.32]Long range laser gun.
[21:33.34]Actually, I kind of like this.
[21:36.02]Also snipe distant enemies.
[21:37.31]Firepower was lower, but can destroy a target by continuously firing.
[21:41.61]Accumulate energy by holding it down.
[21:45.52]Okay.
[21:51.73]Plasma core that specializes in flying.
[21:53.81]Board acceleration increased.
[21:56.07]Damn.
[21:56.71]There's so much.
[21:57.99]Dude, you can read.
[22:00.23]I look like a disgruntled construction worker.
[22:05.01]I'm just orange and yellow with the like safety vest.
[22:08.74]I'm ready.
[22:09.26]Whenever Jerma's ready, because he's the one we're waiting for.
[22:11.74]No, you're waiting for me.
[22:12.86]But I'm the one that just got like seven new items to look at.
[22:16.30]I think the items that we're getting, by the way, are... We all get the same amount, but what items you get are... Oh, okay.
[22:24.43]Yeah, because I got a whole bunch from me, and I didn't see any for your quest.
[22:27.15]I'm trying this thing.
[22:29.71]I got... There was one new fencer item and two upgraded ones from me.
[22:34.34]I'm just going to sit here and eat while you guys talk about your little weapons you got.
[22:39.40]Hey, I love the new Diablo expansion.
[22:42.24]Oh, you don't have phones?
[22:44.12]Just armor.
[22:45.40]Wait, you can bring your armor down?
[22:47.38]Why would you do that?
[22:48.02]I think it's to scale yourself to lower level people.
[22:52.30]I'm going to make the Jerma colors.
[22:53.56]Hold on.
[22:53.86]Alright.
[23:07.37]I'm ready.
[23:09.28]Mission two.
[23:09.74]You guys ever use a mortar before?
[23:16.30]Mortar?
[23:17.26]Wrong colors.
[23:18.40]The light mortar.
[23:19.26]Wait, you don't think I know my own colors?
[23:21.72]What?
[23:21.90]Just try it out, buddy.
[23:28.28]Alright.
[23:29.38]I will.
[23:29.78]Yeah, but I mean, I can't... It's not going to work, guys.
[23:34.88]There's not an entire... That's as close as I'm going to get it.
[23:40.35]More pink, but I can't select it.
[23:42.97]I was told that I was the last one.
[23:44.63]Not ready.
[23:45.09]I'm being screamed at right now.
[23:46.33]Hold on.
[23:49.00]Oh, you can do triangle for cup.
[23:50.30]Whatever, I'll fix it later.
[23:57.80]I don't want anyone to yell at me.
[24:04.57]You will not fix it, and you know it.
[24:10.01]Okay, everybody's muted right now.
[24:11.59]I just, I looked over in the Discord, but just muted.
[24:13.79]So I'm gonna mute too, fine.
[24:16.27]Alright, what's this new weapon I got?
[24:20.49]Can I zoom in with this?
[24:21.57]Oh, how do I let go of this?
[24:24.13]Oh my god, are those dinosaurs in the sky?
[24:27.09]How do I?
[24:28.03]Holy shit.
[24:28.79]Okay, this, now, welcome to EDF.
[24:31.41]This is a, yeah, this is a proper mission.
[24:37.32]I'll get it.
[24:37.70]I'll get it.
[24:37.98]Look at this guy.
[24:40.96]I don't remember how to come.
[24:42.82]I can kill allies with this too, right?
[24:44.72]Alright.
[24:47.02]So this is like a little.
[24:47.92]I actually like this gun.
[24:54.58]Please.
[24:54.74]What do you want me to do?
[24:57.02]I'm willing to see if I can drive him.
[24:58.61]Christmas presents.
[24:59.17]Hold on.
[25:04.15]They killed my comrades.
[25:07.25]Oh, by the way, for those of you, all you guys watching right now, we are playing, this is on normal difficulty, because you want, you have to really play to collect the boxes first.
[25:31.64]Once you get enough boxes, yeah, that was a pretty big mistake too.
[25:36.94]Because you could beat the starting missions on like very hard, but after a while, you didn't have enough armor to beat the later missions.
[25:43.83]So what's the like highest difficulty in the whole game?
[25:48.77]Inferno.
[25:50.37]Which is insane.
[25:55.70]God.
[25:56.08]Well, that gun kind of is terrible.
[26:00.30]Hey, uh, hey, hey.
[26:02.04]Holy shit.
[26:03.46]Hey, germamites.
[26:04.28]Am I like crazy or is that gun terrible?
[26:07.71]Oh, it's pretty bad, man.
[26:08.63]I'm watching your stream, too, while I'm playing.
[26:12.11]Yeah.
[26:13.45]That's new.
[26:14.17]Did you just drop, like, an air strip of bombs?
[26:16.60]Well, you pressed a column on the bomber, and it gives, like, a... It zooms you way out, and you place it on the ground now before you just, like, threw a smoke and guess where it was going to go.
[26:29.31]I'm going to get this stuff.
[26:31.35]How much does first aid heal?
[26:34.07]Does it heal everybody or just like the person who picked it up?
[26:36.53]No, it depends on how big the box is.
[26:37.73]It's like maybe 10 for a little one and maybe 25 for a big one.
[26:44.26]Is this gun suck or what?
[26:48.48]I don't get it.
[26:48.92]I mean, no guns should currently suck on mission two.
[26:55.54]Just seems like it takes a long time to kill anyone.
[26:57.56]All units, get in position.
[27:05.12]Here we go.
[27:06.08]I'm calling in the thing.
[27:10.61]I can't wait to see this.
[27:11.43]I'm so excited for this.
[27:12.19]I hope it kills you.
[27:13.77]It's not going to kill me.
[27:14.43]I'm not even over there.
[27:16.49]Also, it never used to show allies where it was coming in before.
[27:18.89]Did you do that, sir?
[27:19.61]I did that.
[27:20.59]What a cool character.
[27:21.43]Smile.
[27:21.75]I did that.
[27:23.24]Keep the monsters away from the powered exoskeletons.
[27:31.45]I wonder if this, like, spear gun goes through.
[27:34.23]Uh-oh.
[27:35.95]Uh-oh!
[27:38.41]Oh!
[27:39.85]I, like, lost audio.
[27:41.63]There were so many explosions.
[27:45.86]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[27:48.56]Are you in the green lasers?
[27:50.30]I am.
[27:50.58]The green laser's not good.
[27:52.92]I'm doing it wrong.
[27:56.62]There's so much going on.
[27:58.14]Are all these like friendly mechs here pilotable?
[28:00.46]Or are they just like decorations?
[28:02.40]They're kind of just air.
[28:03.48]I think they're decorations.
[28:06.82]Which is sad because they're fun.
[28:08.80]Air Raider, you get like vehicles later.
[28:10.54]So I can summon those for other people.
[28:12.16]And there's like Megazords and crazy stuff and helicopters.
[28:16.65]My eyes.
[28:18.55]Ooh.
[28:18.79]Hold on.
[28:19.01]I'll get these.
[28:19.45]You guys stick with the plan.
[28:21.50]This is a special news flash.
[28:23.68]There have been accounts of UFO sightings everywhere across the globe.
[28:28.93]So how the hell, if you don't have a wing diver in your party, how on Earth do you collect items?
[28:36.47]You don't.
[28:37.79]You kind of just don't, huh?
[28:38.95]The identity of these objects remains unclear.
[28:41.65]I think, I think like if I had a tank or one of the jeeps, I could do it.
[28:46.18]Oh yeah, you can get a bench on it.
[28:48.60]But not as good as a wing diver.
[28:51.72]Can I get them all?
[28:52.56]Okay, incoming another wave.
[28:57.76]Ranger can sprint and get to loot radius now.
[29:02.30]That's cool.
[29:03.74]And these upgrades to air raid are really nice.
[29:08.74]Oh, that uses my jetpack.
[29:10.29]I'm just realizing this is using my jetpack.
[29:14.65]That's why I don't like it.
[29:18.77]I guess you have like a limited amount you can just fly around and get to like land for stamina.
[29:24.51]Yeah, it's kind of like... It's like a standard jetpack in video game where it has a bar.
[29:35.68]I like this thing, but I don't like the... I'm going to replace this weapon.
[29:40.27]For some of you guys... Some of you guys would like the long range, I think.
[29:44.01]You'd like the longer range and a little more direct control.
[29:49.28]But me?
[29:49.92]I'm not like that.
[29:55.28]You're super cool.
[29:57.30]Thanks, man.
[29:58.87]Hey, NP, mate.
[29:59.99]NP.
[30:00.65]Super cool.
[30:04.53]Why aren't you picking up this armor?
[30:06.07]I'm going for it.
[30:06.97]There's a lot to pick up.
[30:08.41]Oh, my God.
[30:08.73]There's a lot over here, actually.
[30:10.59]Get it.
[30:11.01]Get it.
[30:11.55]Get that weapon.
[30:13.20]Oh!
[30:13.38]Get that weapon.
[30:14.04]I got it.
[30:14.36]I got it.
[30:15.20]Okay, we're good.
[30:18.42]Wow, they give you five seconds after the mission's over, huh?
[30:22.45]Look at, oh, okay.
[30:23.85]It's definitely shared, but there's quite a bias here.
[30:26.23]Okay, I don't know about that.
[30:28.21]Hey, who's the new player?
[30:29.65]Is that me, the fencer?
[30:31.97]That seems like a pretty heavy bias.
[30:34.04]Oh, really?
[30:34.86]What do you mean?
[30:36.18]I think I picked the correct class here.
[30:38.88]Do you not see the items acquired?
[30:41.48]I'm going to need about 60 minutes or so, if that's okay.
[30:44.81]It depends on your character.
[30:46.35]Like, I got a whole bunch of Air Raider stuff.
[30:49.39]You did?
[30:50.45]Yeah, because of what I'm playing.
[30:53.37]I got a couple of other classes, but the majority is going to be the class you're playing.
[30:57.40]I got combat bombers out here.
[30:58.78]So we've got class-specific loot.
[31:01.22]That's plus one letter grade, at least.
[31:02.68]Oh, okay, but...
[31:04.47]Don't call me down.
[31:05.01]No one listens to me.
[31:06.31]No, I was listening to you, but then I heard your... No one listens.
[31:09.90]Wait, wait, wait.
[31:11.18]But, Etalyx, last mission you were like... I just ignored you.
[31:14.28]But last mission you were like, oh, I didn't get anything, or I didn't get shit.
[31:19.26]Didn't you say that last mission?
[31:20.78]I did not say that.
[31:21.41]I got three new things.
[31:22.69]What the fuck is happening?
[31:24.87]You're hallucinating.
[31:28.61]Ooh, this is better.
[31:32.53]So, they actually have a star system here.
[31:35.11]Okay, everybody make their new character.
[31:41.56]Yeah, the fun thing about the game is that, like, pretty much every mission, you get pretty much every class to play with.
[31:46.22]Yeah, pretty much every class.
[31:48.42]Yeah.
[31:49.02]It's really super well balanced.
[31:51.54]I can't wait till the PvP mode comes out.
[31:52.69]There's so many items.
[31:55.77]It's just like a giant toy box of different weapons.
[31:59.93]When are they going to release the cowboy character?
[32:01.68]Roam by hand, plasma ball.
[32:05.24]Shotgun.
[32:05.84]Ooh.
[32:10.44]You just don't know how to shoot.
[32:12.44]Oh, I gotta use zig-gun.
[32:13.82]I'm ready.
[32:17.34]You can't be ready.
[32:18.12]We just got eight new weapons.
[32:20.62]I can only flip, like, one of them.
[32:22.30]Just come on, man.
[32:25.78]The game doesn't even start until I get a vehicle.
[32:28.71]This thing, I don't like this thing at all.
[32:30.41]So let me change this thing at least.
[32:31.82]Yeah, I basically am Bob.
[32:33.84]I'm playing Bob the Builder.
[32:35.08]Let's try the shotgun.
[32:36.60]Like, why the heck not?
[32:39.96]Charge.
[32:40.98]Six.
[32:41.26]Hold on.
[32:42.18]Maximum energy.
[32:43.58]Eh, I'll stick with this.
[32:44.90]Maybe you can tell me this.
[32:46.10]I have two hammers.
[32:47.24]They're close-range weapons.
[32:48.58]If I'm so slow, how do you use melee?
[32:55.08]How do you use melee?
[32:56.42]Yeah.
[32:56.60]I have two hammers.
[32:57.50]I could do like dual hammers.
[32:59.64]I'm telling you like one of the items that you got, I think it might have been the shield.
[33:04.71]Someone who's a brilliant gamer at this game, let me know what... Brilliant gamer.
[33:09.45]The big boy do the dash cancel so you could fly around everywhere.
[33:13.36]I think it was any melee weapon you would need equipped and then you would have a dash cancel ability.
[33:24.28]Lance's?
[33:24.76]Yeah, I remember Lance's being able to do it, maybe?
[33:27.36]Shield, Lance's, yeah.
[33:32.54]Shield lets you dash cancel.
[33:38.57]Yeah, so mess around with trying to do that.
[33:41.39]Yeah, it's Lance's.
[33:46.97]This game is fucking fun as hell.
[33:50.74]Don't you guys think this game is just fun as hell?
[33:54.90]No.
[33:57.76]They patched the dash cancel, apparently.
[34:00.42]Says somebody over here.
[34:04.69]They better not have.
[34:06.59]Fucking Blizzard is always ruining their game with fixing bugs that were fun.
[34:13.29]Oh, by the way, we didn't even get a star underscore reaction to Diablo Immortal.
[34:20.76]You didn't?
[34:21.50]No, we didn't.
[34:22.62]We played like Lethal League and then you rage quit and left.
[34:24.45]I thought I talked to you about it.
[34:26.27]We didn't get like an on-camera response.
[34:28.87]On-camera response?
[34:30.23]Yeah, we played Lethal League and you rage quit and I haven't talked to you in like three weeks.
[34:34.49]Oh.
[34:34.61]It's been three weeks?
[34:37.91]When did Lethal League come out?
[34:39.70]Well, I didn't miss you.
[34:41.64]I said that it was clearly Mike Morhaime did the right thing by stepping down.
[34:49.49]And he picked a very good time to get out.
[34:53.33]And it's only gonna get worse.
[34:55.71]That's sad.
[34:57.56]Are we talking about Blizzard drama?
[34:59.44]Sad.
[35:00.14]Yeah, sad.
[35:02.10]Look at the sky!
[35:03.20]Dude, you're fucking huge.
[35:05.22]That cloud looks like an ostrich.
[35:12.43]I'm sorry.
[35:13.15]Look at how cool that is!
[35:14.97]I gotta have a new bow.
[35:16.67]I think we have to destroy it.
[35:19.54]Ooh.
[35:22.14]I don't know.
[35:22.88]Okay, this is my move now.
[35:24.96]This thing is cool.
[35:26.10]This is also my move.
[35:29.62]I have two of these.
[35:30.54]I only have ten bullets each.
[35:33.22]I'm bombing them both.
[35:34.33]Get out of the way.
[35:34.91]I trust you'll get out of the way.
[35:38.55]Get out of the way.
[35:40.23]Oh, that way.
[35:40.99]Get out of that way.
[35:41.75]They missed me.
[35:45.21]Good.
[35:48.37]Can I go in the red circle now?
[35:49.77]I'm out of juice.
[35:50.23]Mommy?
[35:53.48]Yeah.
[35:56.10]Eat shit.
[35:56.66]Watch this one, baby.
[35:57.26]I just became an incredible Hulk.
[36:00.88]That's so fun.
[36:01.62]I can just charge him up.
[36:03.30]Doesn't seem very effective.
[36:04.26]I missed this game.
[36:07.28]If I knew we were going to be fighting pylons, I would have gotten the single target mortar thingy.
[36:11.89]Should we be focusing the pylons or the ants?
[36:14.81]Probably the pylon at this point.
[36:16.71]I'm shooting the pylon.
[36:20.53]I'm getting stuff.
[36:21.85]That soldier just said body shot, like he was something like, ah, fucking body shot me.
[36:27.01]I'm calling in more bombs.
[36:28.91]Oh, come on.
[36:30.05]I only have one booster.
[36:30.91]So does that mean friendly fire is on?
[36:36.52]Actually, I don't think friendly fire comes on until, like, on the higher difficulty.
[36:40.18]That might, you might have, you might be onto something there.
[36:44.45]Oh yeah, because I was blowing up explosives on Etalyx when he was fine.
[36:47.25]That's true, you did line me with explosives.
[36:49.25]Yeah, I don't think you need to worry about it.
[36:57.30]The Lightning Gun is actually really fun, it spreads everywhere.
[36:59.28]Uses a lot of resources though.
[37:02.08]Three... Four... I'm shooting a stationary target over and over again, my stream is loving this game.
[37:15.79]This is a fun game.
[37:16.73]It is.
[37:17.83]Oh my goodness, there's a herpy.
[37:20.87]Wait, you have herpes?
[37:22.65]Oh, I can charge the hammers.
[37:24.35]Wait, are you talking to me?
[37:26.95]Wait, what?
[37:28.79]There's like so many goodies in there and I can't get in there.
[37:30.57]Oh, I can charge it all the way up.
[37:34.25]Alright, I got a lot.
[37:36.53]A little pylon.
[37:40.63]I love the dialogue in this game.
[37:42.81]Will they bring in more monsters?
[37:46.28]This is it, guys.
[37:46.84]We kill them, we save the world.
[37:50.14]What is that song?
[37:51.46]Yeah, what is playing?
[37:53.80]I thought one of you was, like, playing... We gotta go to the other pylon.
[37:57.04]I'm on the way.
[37:57.66]Help is on the way, dear!
[38:01.34]It is said to be 10 meters long, extremely aggressive, and will most likely attack humans.
[38:07.50]Stay tuned for more updates.
[38:09.24]Uh-oh, something's gonna attack humans.
[38:11.18]Something's gonna go after the humans.
[38:13.08]I swear to God, if you're not picking up all the weapon boxes, Jerma...
[38:16.97]I am doing my work, okay?
[38:19.26]Alright, so... Attack the upper part.
[38:25.30]Yeah, yeah.
[38:26.26]Dude, the purple thing at the top.
[38:29.66]Alright, I got some time here to... Let's get up there.
[38:31.96]Watch this point-blank eat shit.
[38:34.27]Watch this one.
[38:35.05]You're doing the objective!
[38:40.31]Oh, God.
[38:42.25]I had to have done at least two damage there.
[38:44.63]Guys, have you been...
[38:46.84]Hitting the bottom part of it?
[38:49.02]No, I was, yes.
[38:50.56]Hitting the bottom part of what?
[38:52.58]The pylon.
[38:53.56]Yeah, I have it.
[38:54.78]Yeah, we both have it.
[38:56.30]So it's not just me.
[38:59.50]It's not just me.
[39:00.38]To be fair, my weapon can only hit the bottom part of the pylon.
[39:05.76]Okay, okay.
[39:08.00]How's this for the bottom part of the pylon?
[39:10.92]We'll put that.
[39:13.78]Oh, I thought you were talking... Yeah, I just did a body.
[39:17.15]What the fuck?
[39:21.21]What?
[39:21.49]Where am I?
[39:24.83]Yes, sir!
[39:25.33]Alright, I'm good.
[39:31.20]Alright, did I get all the boxes in there?
[39:35.96]It'll cause casualties, but not only that...
[39:39.14]Casualties!
[39:42.22]Alright, I gotta move.
[39:45.38]There are boxes over here.
[39:46.92]Sorry, guys.
[39:47.65]Do your thing.
[39:48.13]I was about to travel abroad next week.
[39:56.37]Alright, now I can actually help.
[39:58.63]I'm coming.
[40:08.93]The last EDF, like, four, the monsters had been dormant, but this game now, like, everyone doesn't know what they are again.
[40:16.36]What are they?
[40:16.94]It's a full reboot.
[40:19.34]Yeah, we rebooted the lore.
[40:23.50]It's true.
[40:24.18]It really is true.
[40:25.64]And I read the whole wiki before this game just to prepare.
[40:28.22]No, it's monsters.
[40:35.29]I need to get some more fuel in the tank.
[40:40.15]Also, I think it's safe to assume that in this world ants don't exist because no one knew what ants were when they showed up.
[40:47.30]They said they were dinosaurs.
[40:51.74]What are they, dinosaurs?
[40:53.71]They would technically not be ants unless they were enlarged by some kind of reverse shrink ray, right?
[40:58.69]They would be like, because they look the same, doesn't mean they're the same.
[41:01.91]I think we got it.
[41:02.33]If they're such good ants, then why are they not carrying breadcrumbs back to their hide?
[41:20.56]I love this game.
[41:22.52]Here come more pylons.
[41:25.74]I love the double hammers you got there.
[41:27.06]Oh my god.
[41:30.06]Can I imagine if we started on hard?
[41:33.34]Hey guys, start on hard like we did last time!
[41:36.94]Nah, we can't.
[41:38.31]Yeah, that's the... they said we gotta retreat.
[41:45.07]I wonder what we got.
[41:45.71]What's inside of our boxes?
[41:48.78]Ooh.
[41:49.90]Oh.
[41:50.48]Oh.
[41:52.03]Dude, you didn't pick up any weapon boxes.
[41:54.39]There weren't any.
[41:56.27]There was a shitload of armor boxes.
[41:57.33]You only got four weapons this time.
[41:59.15]Oh, they weren't... There were only, like, three or four.
[42:01.33]Look at the amount of armor.
[42:02.19]Look at the amount of HP that I gave you, okay?
[42:05.91]There weren't any.
[42:09.37]Alright, but I love... I got another, uh... Sparkbind.
[42:13.04]That's... I don't... Is this new?
[42:15.36]Could you get better versions of the same weapon before...
[42:18.62]What?
[42:18.84]Yeah.
[42:19.30]You could?
[42:20.32]I don't remember this kind of upgrading part where you can pick up better versions of the same weapon.
[42:25.65]Yeah.
[42:27.85]One of the reasons we never noticed it is because we started on the hard difficulty, so we had the best versions of every weapon.
[42:34.73]Oh, okay.
[42:35.40]Makes sense.
[42:39.56]So what does a star mean next to the level?
[42:43.11]I have no idea.
[42:43.94]I don't know.
[42:45.02]If level is the most important factor... This thing is cool.
[42:48.02]There's like an empty star number, too.
[42:49.96]Yeah, I've been looking at it.
[42:51.30]It's been confusing me.
[42:52.80]Okay, literally the first weapon that I see here in chat is what I'm gonna pick.
[42:57.23]I don't care what it is.
[42:57.87]I have something on this list.
[43:04.11]Spark, okay.
[43:05.21]Flog.
[43:08.14]I'm really confused.
[43:11.51]Oh, it means it's for me.
[43:12.47]It's hysteric.
[43:13.79]I like the shotguns really cool, but... Maybe I'll try a grenade.
[43:18.19]Try missile launchers.
[43:26.26]I'm going to try readying up.
[43:29.32]I don't know how to do that.
[43:34.28]Chut up.
[43:37.78]No, you chut up.
[43:45.10]No, you shut up.
[43:51.05]It's always a talent.
[43:53.83]I can't help it.
[43:57.63]You gave me too much power.
[44:02.13]Why can you do that?
[44:03.24]Why are there like 30 different versions of ha ha ha?
[44:08.46]Ha ha ha.
[44:09.98]Go to it.
[44:10.46]Look at it.
[44:10.76]Yeah, I know.
[44:13.84]It's for how you want to express yourself.
[44:18.93]Blink ball.
[44:19.51]Let's see what it does.
[44:23.61]It is just a grenade, huh?
[44:26.65]Oh, man.
[44:27.53]That's kind of cool.
[44:28.19]It takes a long time to recharge, though.
[44:29.57]I get it.
[44:30.81]You're sorry.
[44:31.35]Oof.
[44:31.47]Oof.
[44:31.66]Oof.
[44:31.80]Roblox.
[44:31.96]Roblox.
[44:32.26]Oof.
[44:44.55]Roblox?
[44:45.55]No, Roblox.
[44:46.40]Oof.
[44:48.10]Oof.
[44:50.78]I'm really late to these memes.
[44:52.38]I'm fucking old.
[44:55.98]Oh, we have to destroy pylons.
[44:58.28]Okay.
[44:58.74]We're talking about, like... Yeah, pylons.
[45:00.48]Oh, check this.
[45:01.96]I don't even know what an ion shield does.
[45:04.00]Off the top of your head.
[45:14.34]You remember how many times we did like the first mission and the last one?
[45:20.54]Everything about that was what I liked.
[45:22.18]Everything about that is what I liked.
[45:24.22]Oops.
[45:32.45]Twitch chat is all chat- Twitch chat boomers.
[45:36.59]Twitch chat is all Twitch chat boomers.
[45:38.53]Alright, did people call you guys boomers in your chat?
[45:42.64]Oh, I found my favorite weapon now.
[45:46.72]I'm actually becoming a Gundam.
[45:51.68]That's just kind of hard to aim on console.
[45:53.96]It doesn't matter.
[45:54.48]It's going to go bot.
[45:55.60]That's what I was trying to do.
[45:57.48]Bingo!
[45:58.57]I'm on pylon duty.
[46:00.29]Get these damn bugs off me.
[46:13.92]Hey, get these damn bugs off me.
[46:19.99]Nobody calls you guys boomers?
[46:22.07]There's a weapon crate right here.
[46:24.01]I'm trying to figure out where they fell.
[46:26.33]There's one right here.
[46:27.49]I know.
[46:28.45]Does anyone call you boomers?
[46:30.40]Yes.
[46:32.64]Why would they call someone who is like seven years younger than you boomers too?
[46:38.60]I don't know.
[46:39.20]Oh, what?
[46:39.66]You can't stand on the tank?
[46:45.78]I don't know, people just say it to me.
[46:48.50]In a very mean way.
[46:51.43]I hope you can still put the gun on the tank.
[46:59.69]Check it.
[47:00.29]Three, two, one, action!
[47:05.02]I did that.
[47:05.34]That was me.
[47:05.86]I did that.
[47:06.64]That wasn't you.
[47:07.93]Yes, it was.
[47:08.99]That was some guy, like, sitting at a computer somewhere.
[47:13.65]Hey, so what we're doing... Hey, why don't you ask anyone?
[47:17.17]That was me.
[47:18.67]No, it was me.
[47:20.09]I made you.
[47:21.65]Okay, fine.
[47:22.49]Ask me anything, guys.
[47:23.97]You two.
[47:24.44]AMA?
[47:24.86]We're doing an AMA right now?
[47:26.36]Not chat.
[47:26.86]I'm talking about you two.
[47:28.14]What direction is the gigantic ship in?
[47:31.12]Uh, north.
[47:36.85]I feel like I know everything that I need to know.
[47:38.53]Yeah, you probably do.
[47:41.99]This is really hard to aim.
[47:46.69]It just kind of is.
[47:47.37]Wait, that didn't... That's L2.
[47:50.95]That's really weird.
[47:51.75]Watch out.
[47:52.03]There's a new pylon.
[47:54.79]That camera switch is like... Yeah.
[47:58.48]You don't like it?
[48:07.86]I feel like you probably got asked a lot of questions and didn't AMA answer any of them.
[48:11.80]Oh, you said it was just for us.
[48:12.72]Yeah, you said it was just for us.
[48:14.78]That was the only question in my AMA.
[48:20.40]What is this indicator?
[48:21.46]You sure?
[48:22.38]Yeah.
[48:24.30]There's nothing that you want to ask me.
[48:29.02]Anything.
[48:29.90]I mean, I'm talking anything.
[48:30.88]This is ask me anything.
[48:33.46]What's your Twitch password, man?
[48:35.88]What's your stream key?
[48:48.28]How much money would it take
[48:50.92]play the new Diablo online and stream it.
[48:55.50]The Diablo Immortal?
[48:56.22]I want to do that.
[48:57.64]Dude, if someone gave me a way to stream from a phone, then I didn't have to figure out myself 100%.
[49:02.96]It's very, very easy.
[49:05.02]You just need to get the... It's just the HDI.
[49:10.21]It's the HDMI adapter for Apple.
[49:13.57]You just go to the Apple store.
[49:14.59]You pay like the $45 for this piece of plastic.
[49:16.35]Okay.
[49:19.60]And, uh, you just plug in HDMI to it and plug that into, like, the capture card.
[49:23.17]That's it.
[49:23.99]I'm ready.
[49:27.43]Oh, dude.
[49:28.39]Actually, you tried to play it with me one time 20 years ago.
[49:31.07]The Median XL.
[49:33.81]Yes.
[49:34.33]You know, Median XL is getting like an HD remastered kind of thing coming out.
[49:39.26]Interesting.
[49:39.60]You know that I downloaded that like five days ago.
[49:44.68]Not even kidding.
[49:45.50]I proved it to him.
[49:47.90]He has been bitching about Diablo for at least three weeks now.
[49:51.10]That's correct.
[49:52.58]What's Diablo?
[49:53.94]All of it.
[49:55.14]What?
[49:55.94]What are you talking about?
[49:57.04]Explain yourself.
[49:58.10]Diablo Mortal thing, and I was like, what the heck?
[50:00.00]Diablo II is the best game.
[50:01.80]Oh, well, Media and Excel thing is coming out.
[50:03.80]Hey, look.
[50:04.92]I'm going to prove to you.
[50:08.82]I don't know what you're proving.
[50:09.96]That I, like, downloaded.
[50:13.78]I have Median XL installed on my computer, I swear to God, right now.
[50:18.59]The new Diablo was revealed.
[50:20.37]Diablo II was installed.
[50:21.61]Well, they're coming out with the new version of it that has the HD remastered, better than Blizzard could ever do it version.
[50:28.07]Really?
[50:29.31]Yeah, it's getting like, the skills are being remapped, all the UI is done, they built a new engine.
[50:34.66]It's widescreen.
[50:36.52]I thought it didn't just release?
[50:38.12]Didn't that just happen, or is that something else?
[50:40.46]No, they just announced it, but that's coming out in January.
[50:43.70]Um, okay.
[50:44.18]They've been working on that for a long time.
[50:45.86]That sounds like fun.
[50:47.16]I would highly recommend you try it with me, because I'm down to prime, and I know all the ins and outs.
[50:52.68]You know the ins and outs, yeah.
[50:55.42]I did install the original one.
[50:59.68]The original one, I can prove it to you.
[51:01.58]You know what?
[51:03.40]Despite what I said, the day that the Diablo thing was announced, I also installed the game, except I installed Path of Exile.
[51:11.89]Yeah, well, MedianXL, like, the guy who made MedianXL did a lot of work on Path of Exile.
[51:20.60]What is going on over here?
[51:21.48]It's a lot like Path of Exile.
[51:22.82]You should try it too, Etalyx.
[51:24.24]I'm converting everyone.
[51:25.26]What are we doing?
[51:26.18]Are we waiting for something?
[51:27.04]I think we're supposed to shoot the UFO or they're dropping bad guys in.
[51:30.32]Flying saucers are coming out!
[51:32.36]The building just collapsed and I'm standing on it.
[51:34.74]Yeah, I launched rockets at it.
[51:36.93]Hit it.
[51:40.33]Right in the middle.
[51:42.76]They're dropping down, like, CDs.
[51:45.78]Yeah, this is a disc shooter from, like, the 90s.
[51:48.32]90s boomers.
[51:49.20]There's a game that was on PS2, so... I missed a weapon crate.
[51:56.41]I was too big.
[51:56.85]Whatever.
[51:58.77]I can't do all the work.
[52:00.41]Yeah, people just see it.
[52:03.75]If they show up as Ws on the map.
[52:07.44]Plasma's big.
[52:08.18]We have to get this W. Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[52:10.87]I didn't get anything new.
[52:11.72]I'm ready.
[52:12.28]And up wave.
[52:14.10]Ooh, another one.
[52:15.88]Ooh, another one.
[52:16.98]Didn't get anything new, guys.
[52:19.92]Alright, so... I did, but I'm not going to be the last one to ready this time.
[52:23.00]What the fuck am I doing?
[52:27.75]Wait, does it say what we're fighting?
[52:28.87]That would be really nice if it did.
[52:30.81]I don't know.
[52:32.77]Oh, the flying objects.
[52:34.05]Oh, God.
[52:34.67]Pulse machine gun.
[52:36.49]I'm going to try it.
[52:38.15]Alright, the first thing that I see in chat.
[52:43.03]Okay, got it.
[52:47.65]Machine gun.
[52:52.69]Wait, are there two different?
[52:53.89]No, it's just this one.
[52:56.60]No, I want to get rid of this.
[52:57.50]It's too hard to aim on console.
[53:07.28]Alright, I'm gonna try that again.
[53:08.26]Oh, God, Jerma.
[53:10.16]I got a lot of new stuff.
[53:12.20]I'm ready.
[53:12.56]Jerma's gonna be flying enemies.
[53:14.14]You're not even ready.
[53:15.58]Why are you complaining to me?
[53:16.81]Because I'm waiting for you.
[53:18.47]I was looking at things because you were looking at things.
[53:20.89]It perpetuates itself.
[53:22.39]You can't be mad at me because you were also looking at your equipment.
[53:29.79]Isn't that the whole point of playing this game?
[53:32.59]Kind of.
[53:32.95]Ooh, new weapon.
[53:34.97]Spiders.
[53:35.61]I remember these.
[53:36.43]I hate these.
[53:37.53]New weapon.
[53:38.67]Spiders.
[53:39.15]Oh, I hate these things.
[53:40.43]I fucking hate them.
[53:42.07]They're so scary.
[53:43.23]Oh, the ones that, like, shoot webs and everything?
[53:46.07]They make really creepy noises?
[53:49.76]Plasma big cannon.
[53:51.70]Yes, this spaceship was made by Russians.
[53:55.14]That's a big cannon.
[53:58.40]What are those?
[53:59.04]What are those?
[54:00.36]Oh, God.
[54:01.34]Actual boomers in chat.
[54:03.32]Zoom in!
[54:07.70]Oh, what are those?
[54:08.84]I don't think this is fair.
[54:12.07]I don't think I have a good load up for this level.
[54:14.31]Dude, I said it was going to be flying enemies like three times so that you'd be ready for this.
[54:18.65]Shut up, you fucking boomer.
[54:20.09]Fuck.
[54:23.29]There's nothing that I like about you.
[54:25.36]Actually, this is pretty good.
[54:35.04]I'm taking out saucers, man.
[54:42.02]We're taking this.
[54:43.34]That's a big cannon.
[54:50.95]That's the kind of noise you would actually make if that happened to you.
[54:55.63]So what does air support do right now?
[54:59.30]Don't you have, like, jets you can call in to, like, snipe them?
[55:01.48]How do I turn this off?
[55:02.50]I think they were shooting through the thing.
[55:05.36]It looked like they were.
[55:06.24]Oh, it's square.
[55:07.49]Okay.
[55:10.49]I kind of enjoy just one-shotting all these.
[55:13.35]Yeah, it's shooting through the big ship.
[55:15.73]Like, it's not there.
[55:16.43]There wasn't boxes.
[55:17.33]I don't see any boxes.
[55:18.72]This one.
[55:22.72]Why does my shotgun have knockback on these?
[55:25.56]That's cool, it, like, tracks the saucers, though.
[55:33.61]Holy shit, that was scary.
[55:35.37]I'm gonna- I'm going to die.
[55:37.17]I'm going to die.
[55:37.95]Do I need to come over?
[55:39.83]Uh, I need- I need to find help, is what needs to happen.
[55:43.10]How do you shoot a major pulse cannon and miss every single enemy that are disconnected?
[55:46.46]Again.
[55:46.96]Again.
[55:51.69]Maybe if you were just picking up weapon boxes like I told you to do.
[55:55.02]I'm dead.
[55:55.22]I'm dead.
[55:55.50]I'm down.
[55:57.01]Kallax, to your right.
[55:57.77]We may have another problem.
[56:01.37]Talc is almost down, too.
[56:02.21]That's why I'm running over to a Ster.
[56:04.87]Star!
[56:05.59]Star!
[56:06.03]See, I'm right next to him.
[56:07.47]Can I res you guys?
[56:08.99]We got annihilated.
[56:15.17]They're just crashing into each other.
[56:17.79]They're just smashing into each other.
[56:19.71]Press the vehicle rescue button.
[56:21.99]What the fuck is the vehicle rescue button?
[56:24.20]Just press every button, okay?
[56:27.08]Thank you.
[56:29.32]Alright, now me.
[56:30.46]Now give me some heals.
[56:31.46]Any support?
[56:33.90]They're just crashing into each other.
[56:35.82]Thank you.
[56:37.27]I'm gonna die because of you.
[56:39.67]I'm dead again.
[56:41.69]Well, there is health right there.
[56:44.11]You just got it.
[56:46.37]I'm dead.
[56:47.57]What's the rescue button?
[56:49.47]It's circle.
[56:55.31]We're in a lot of trouble here.
[57:00.41]Any more health?
[57:00.99]I can't tell.
[57:01.97]I did enjoy being alive for an extra 15 seconds.
[57:05.32]I get it, Etalyx.
[57:06.22]You're dead in your bed.
[57:09.44]Excuse me.
[57:10.22]I'm coming.
[57:11.20]Who's being resurrected right now?
[57:13.42]I'm coming.
[57:14.69]Not me.
[57:15.25]What are you talking about?
[57:17.27]Then why do you have one HP?
[57:19.23]I'm coming.
[57:20.83]I have three.
[57:23.31]I'm sorry.
[57:24.45]Did I get you?
[57:26.73]You got to be in this underhang.
[57:29.41]I have three health.
[57:36.08]You actually do just have to be in this underhang.
[57:38.82]Yeah, it's actually been working really well.
[57:40.62]I'm coming.
[57:42.98]So there is friendly fire if you do the explosion on yourself.
[57:47.40]So are we just gonna cheese under the fucking sneeze guard?
[57:50.57]Yeah, my guns do explosions.
[57:55.17]Okay, I see help.
[57:56.25]I'm going for it in a second.
[58:03.27]Oh my god.
[58:06.87]Alright, I'm back to kinda normal here.
[58:11.99]What just happened to me?
[58:13.37]What'd you just do?
[58:15.17]Did you just shoot a... I just had 75 health and I'm at zero.
[58:23.28]What happened over there?
[58:30.87]Fucking guys are on your own.
[58:35.53]If you had been picking up more armor, we wouldn't be in this situation.
[58:44.01]Oh, he's shot.
[58:45.80]I don't think we'd get them if we lose the mission.
[58:48.42]We don't.
[58:48.86]I'm dead.
[58:50.82]I'm on the roof, too.
[58:52.38]Good luck getting me.
[58:56.31]There's no one gonna get me up here.
[58:57.75]I'm done.
[58:58.03]Nobody's shot me in a long time, so I might just stay here and not come get you.
[59:01.69]Yeah.
[59:02.51]Fucking roof.
[59:05.39]Oh, God.
[59:06.89]I did so much.
[59:08.77]I killed myself.
[59:09.83]Hang on.
[59:12.16]Hold on.
[59:12.98]I got a shield.
[59:14.38]Welcome to EDF.
[59:18.26]Can you guys destroy the building behind you?
[59:21.14]Come to me.
[59:23.05]Alright, go find another safe place and blow up this building.
[59:28.19]No, we're winning the mission.
[59:29.49]Yeah, we kinda- this kinda worked out.
[59:31.29]You're not gonna beat the mission.
[59:32.49]They're starting to get under here.
[59:34.21]Yeah, they're like going surfing on the concrete.
[59:37.34]We're gonna beat the mission.
[59:38.44]Uh, no.
[59:39.48]You remember last game too, the first mission where we started losing was when they uh, all the fucking flying things.
[59:49.76]Oh yeah, I remember.
[59:50.88]Retreat or restart?
[59:54.53]waiting for the host to make a selection.
[59:56.23]Yeah, retreat or restart.
[59:58.71]Just try it again.
[59:59.61]This time we'll be prepared.
[60:00.59]Just get ready for the saucers.
[60:01.71]I wouldn't mind switching weapons.
[60:04.02]Oh, okay.
[60:04.78]Well, then we'll switch weapons.
[60:09.76]I was a bit rushed.
[60:12.28]Oh.
[60:14.88]Well, we did get some armor.
[60:17.90]Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[60:19.40]Ba-ding, ba-ding.
[60:25.74]Maybe lightning bow.
[60:27.52]Lightning bow or that spark vine is good.
[60:31.44]I think I can just... I don't know.
[60:34.00]I'm going to get the bombers and hope that they do things.
[60:40.24]This thing is too big.
[60:46.61]No, it's got its use.
[60:47.89]It does.
[60:48.21]I want a vehicle drama.
[60:53.85]So pick it up.
[61:00.63]Or no, you're right.
[61:01.53]Hold on.
[61:03.05]That would be good here.
[61:11.68]First one ready.
[61:12.44]Let the court know.
[61:13.60]So what did you guys do on your Sunday?
[61:19.68]What's today?
[61:20.20]My Sunday?
[61:20.78]What did you guys do on your Wednesday?
[61:23.94]You realize we live in the same house, right?
[61:26.51]No.
[61:27.87]I know what you did today.
[61:29.73]Is today Wednesday?
[61:31.97]Today is Wednesday.
[61:32.65]What did you do on this Wednesday?
[61:34.27]I did a lot of stuff.
[61:35.09]I cannot talk about it on stream.
[61:36.55]People are saying that you're quiet.
[61:40.24]How is that possible?
[61:41.38]Speak, Star.
[61:43.42]Speak.
[61:43.94]I'm speaking.
[61:44.68]Speak.
[61:45.02]Speaks.
[61:45.90]This is an example of speaks.
[61:47.52]Now, Etalyx, you talk.
[61:53.17]Do it right or I'm coming over there.
[61:55.67]Just scream in your mic.
[62:00.27]I'm coming over to scream as loud as I can on your mic if you don't do it.
[62:04.27]What did I just do?
[62:05.05]Oh, you did it.
[62:05.73]Okay.
[62:05.97]We're good.
[62:10.06]Go scream EDF.
[62:14.64]Oh, also we do only have three people.
[62:16.56]Scream as loud as you can and see if you can hear it on mine.
[62:19.00]Let's see if this helps a little.
[62:30.60]Let's see if it helps.
[62:31.52]Go peek Etalyx' mic.
[62:35.64]Oh, fuck.
[62:36.46]Oh, fuck.
[62:37.00]Hold on.
[62:39.00]Oh, fuck.
[62:40.66]Alright, you guys should be good now.
[62:42.90]Oh, fuck.
[62:43.38]Are you ready?
[62:44.22]Oh, fuck.
[62:45.86]What are you doing?
[62:46.54]I am, I am, I am, but fuck.
[62:48.05]I'm changing stuff.
[62:49.23]I'm good.
[62:49.51]Uh-oh.
[62:50.65]No, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[62:53.37]Everything's good.
[62:54.65]I guess I'm a lefty now.
[62:55.59]Okay.
[62:57.23]Okay.
[63:01.38]So I got the shot.
[63:02.44]This is going to help a lot.
[63:03.34]I will take care of the monsters coming up from the ship.
[63:09.88]I didn't hit one shot.
[63:11.68]All you have to do is just hit things and also not die.
[63:25.77]Oh, this is definitely the weapon.
[63:27.55]I'm not even going to equip the other one for any reason.
[63:30.60]Yeah.
[63:34.92]I think we just hide under here the whole time, to be honest.
[63:38.02]We're dropping bombs already.
[63:43.21]Yeah.
[63:46.11]So if the aliens attack, but the air support specialist bombs the entire city anyways.
[63:52.27]It goes through them.
[63:53.53]Did we actually save anything?
[63:57.21]No, I'm bombing the street and the street is fine.
[64:00.94]That's just a... Like, as long as we hang out under here and I bomb the street, then we're good.
[64:06.22]Because they kept bunching up on the street.
[64:12.83]I'm in my own little world over here.
[64:14.23]You guys have fun.
[64:16.25]You're like playing a different video game.
[64:18.87]Yeah, that's always how that class feels.
[64:21.65]Humans!
[64:22.89]Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[64:33.83]Need to recharge for a second.
[64:36.85]Did he just say, if we let them run rampage?
[64:40.19]They're gonna run rampant.
[64:42.41]No, he said run rampage.
[64:48.97]If we let them run rampage.
[64:54.31]I don't know if this is such a good idea right here.
[64:56.05]Oh my, ow.
[64:56.87]I don't know if this is a good idea.
[65:02.18]Which part?
[65:03.46]All three of us standing in the same place.
[65:09.07]I'm going out.
[65:11.49]Don't worry, I got knocked back.
[65:13.01]See, that's why, because we just got fucking collateraled right there.
[65:17.15]Well, you keep flying around then, and just don't get hit.
[65:20.41]Do you know how hard it is to do that in that game?
[65:23.56]I kind of just have to stay still.
[65:25.14]That's a weapon crit I gotta get.
[65:27.20]That's sort of what I do.
[65:28.04]All members are equipped with equipment D.
[65:32.18]very well attack the flying saucers attack oh we just got permission I don't know what we've been doing up until now attack the flying saucers we have the government go ahead I can hear that all the way over here good and start to plug me get it oh get it
[65:57.18]Dude, they really just give you constant news reports.
[65:59.36]This is like playing Fallout where you get all the data disks.
[66:02.60]This is how they tell their story.
[66:04.74]We're doing a lot better.
[66:06.28]Oh, come on, man.
[66:07.20]Don't embarrass me on my own stream.
[66:09.44]Everything's getting very quiet.
[66:10.84]Yeah.
[66:27.09]I thought I was losing my hearing.
[66:32.18]Easy.
[66:32.58]Here come more.
[66:41.12]You're just singing down here.
[66:42.41]Why do I have a different voice every time, though?
[66:44.33]Because you're like Darth Vader.
[66:46.03]He's muffled in there.
[66:54.90]Oh, fuck.
[66:57.90]Oh, no.
[66:59.12]Oh, no, guys.
[67:02.58]What?
[67:03.78]Are you fine?
[67:04.38]Are you losing?
[67:08.29]Oh!
[67:08.95]Whoa!
[67:11.83]Is it your fault we're losing?
[67:13.49]No!
[67:13.91]What?
[67:14.21]There's a medkit.
[67:19.91]I feel like my deflection shield isn't really deflecting much.
[67:24.05]That's because you're... Oh my god.
[67:27.19]Oh my god.
[67:27.89]This is not fun for me.
[67:31.81]I even have a shield.
[67:32.83]I'm still dead.
[67:36.35]Oh my god, I just took so much damage.
[67:38.31]Oh, I died on the fucking roof again.
[67:39.89]Oh, god damn it.
[67:43.03]Yeah, this is the wave where it's not possible.
[67:46.86]Currently.
[67:48.94]Well, we can run the other missions, get more armor, and maybe get better equipment.
[67:54.72]I don't have the best anti-air equipment.
[67:58.26]That is correct.
[67:59.70]Get the green crates.
[68:00.80]It's hard when you get out of cover and a hundred ships surround you and you die in three hits.
[68:05.14]Are you making fun of me?
[68:10.16]No, I'm just saying our strategy is flawed.
[68:16.34]I don't have a strategy.
[68:17.80]I think you're... Oh, dude, yeah, I could use the bunker.
[68:25.12]Standing in the same place with the spread out.
[68:27.72]Haven't you guys ever seen Harbin before?
[68:29.54]We don't need to spread out.
[68:30.47]I have the electromagnetic bunker.
[68:32.59]It creates a shield that can't be shot through, but we can shoot through.
[68:35.95]So it can be shot.
[68:37.05]And we all just stand in the same spot.
[68:38.73]Well, shut up, Etalyx.
[68:39.81]No one likes you.
[68:42.07]Whoa.
[68:42.97]No one likes being wrong either, apparently.
[68:45.28]Whoa.
[68:45.76]Whoa.
[68:50.83]Hold on a second.
[68:51.93]Lick.
[68:52.43]What did Ashley put in your food earlier?
[68:55.78]Poison.
[68:56.78]It's rat poison.
[68:58.02]Hold on a minute here.
[68:58.96]Lick.
[69:00.84]Hold on.
[69:01.42]Here, guys, we're going again.
[69:02.56]Not rat poison.
[69:04.03]What do you mean?
[69:04.65]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[69:05.29]Listen, listen, listen.
[69:06.77]We go again.
[69:14.48]I also have, I have a life vendor.
[69:16.04]You know what that does?
[69:16.80]It supplies hit points to my allies.
[69:18.93]Your voice is very loud and fucked up right now.
[69:23.01]Why is my voice fucked up?
[69:24.37]I don't know.
[69:24.81]I don't know what you did.
[69:26.42]You like plugged in a different mic.
[69:27.48]He's just leaning in.
[69:28.54]Can you ready up, Etalyx?
[69:30.77]Why are we doing this again on the same level?
[69:32.45]We're doing it again.
[69:33.85]We go again.
[69:34.95]I don't know what you're doing.
[69:36.91]I told you this.
[69:37.83]Listen.
[69:38.25]They can't shoot us.
[69:40.29]I have healing.
[69:41.25]We stand under thing.
[69:42.41]It's fine.
[69:43.51]What is a gain?
[69:44.37]Exactly what we did last time, except there was a healing item.
[69:50.36]You're going to be in big trouble after this.
[69:52.10]The barrier and the healing.
[69:55.34]What do you mean we go?
[69:58.48]I'm ready.
[70:01.10]If we lose this time, it's just probably Etalyx.
[70:03.80]Um, no.
[70:05.38]It would be you, actually, because... Will it be you?
[70:08.56]You're the one that we're depending on.
[70:10.48]Will it be me?
[70:12.60]Or will it be me?
[70:16.86]What are those?
[70:17.76]Nice whiffs, man.
[70:18.88]Okay, when it gets to that phase, we go under the thing.
[70:25.18]Okay.
[70:25.44]Get to the phase, go under the thing.
[70:30.35]Get to the phase, go in the thing.
[70:31.45]Dude, this is on normal difficulty too.
[70:35.12]You understand?
[70:37.36]I understand this is normal.
[70:39.36]I understand we're missing a player because you don't have any friends.
[70:45.24]Wait, is that some kind of jab?
[70:48.00]There are two players currently here in the same household.
[70:52.27]So where's your second?
[70:53.97]There's a plus one invitation.
[70:56.55]I invited you and Jerma didn't invite anyone.
[71:00.07]Was I supposed to invite somebody else?
[71:02.69]Okay, okay, let's get under.
[71:03.91]Everyone under.
[71:04.45]We're gonna test the strat.
[71:08.71]I don't know how this gets deployed.
[71:10.14]I can't wait until we all die here.
[71:11.44]God, that's it?
[71:12.30]Yeah, great.
[71:13.08]Cool.
[71:13.64]It was actually I who invited you, by the way.
[71:16.68]Just so we're clear.
[71:17.44]Can we shoot through this?
[71:19.02]Yes.
[71:20.06]And I am afraid their targets are humans.
[71:25.01]Odd man killing weapons, huh?
[71:27.46]Alright, this stupid strategy is going to work.
[71:29.30]How often do you put those down?
[71:31.22]Depends on how long the shield lasts for, I guess.
[71:33.66]I have no idea.
[71:34.52]I have to get out there and pick up stuff, though, on a periodic basis.
[71:39.14]Well, once it ends, all the stuff to pick up is going to be out here.
[71:43.51]Alright, one shield down.
[71:45.33]We're going to... Someone's going to blow... I'm going to kill us.
[71:48.43]I can already guarantee it.
[71:49.11]I've got to get out of here.
[71:50.69]I can't stay near you guys.
[71:51.31]Are you claustrophobic or something?
[71:54.21]No, I have, like, explosives.
[71:57.20]Why don't you have one over here?
[71:59.02]Hey!
[71:59.16]What the fuck?
[72:01.58]It got destroyed and I can't place it anymore.
[72:05.38]Here, have a heal.
[72:06.72]I put the heal.
[72:07.44]What do you mean a heal?
[72:09.24]I put the heal drone thing down.
[72:12.28]There's green.
[72:13.00]Why have you been using that since the very beginning?
[72:16.74]That's a great question.
[72:17.34]Because I was using artillery.
[72:19.57]And it's more fun.
[72:20.37]I don't want to be the fucking support for you.
[72:22.61]Hmm, interesting.
[72:23.29]You picked a class called Air Support.
[72:26.83]Yeah, and I have nothing that comes from the air.
[72:29.53]Also, it's called Air Raider.
[72:33.17]Well, raid my health bar.
[72:37.28]Whoa.
[72:37.58]That's what you should be doing, not raiding the ground.
[72:47.91]I don't know how I get more barriers.
[72:51.88]This is my chance to get some stuff.
[72:54.84]might have to pick up like a weapon box to get more I don't know objects could be obtained governments of all countries are still denied reload it doesn't oh I do press reload on it and they'll go away well I'm not going to have them for a while oh no you're not okay well then this strategy so what's your cool down on the on the deflection it's like
[73:20.75]20% reloaded.
[73:22.49]Here comes the big wave I think.
[73:23.51]I still have more health I can put down though.
[73:25.07]Yeah, I think this is the big one.
[73:26.12]It's incoming in a second.
[73:29.42]Ow.
[73:30.70]Alright, here it is.
[73:33.22]Hope you guys are prepared.
[73:35.54]I'm blocking this guy on the left.
[73:38.12]Oh my lord.
[73:38.90]Alright, here it comes.
[73:41.02]I'm so scared.
[73:47.11]Don't worry, this is easy.
[73:48.19]This is the easier mission because there's so many you can't miss.
[73:51.67]Did you switch the difficulty for the... Maybe?
[73:54.74]Shit.
[73:57.30]And we have the healing stations still up.
[74:02.99]The powerful country is attacking us, Jerma.
[74:07.17]Ow.
[74:10.41]Keep it up.
[74:12.09]It's almost, I almost have barriers.
[74:14.67]Good, because we're gonna need them.
[74:16.49]Oh god!
[74:18.27]It's pretty good for my shotgun.
[74:19.95]Because they're right on top of us.
[74:24.08]I don't know if I'm hurting myself or they're hurting me.
[74:30.68]I got some down, I got some down.
[74:32.45]Awful.
[74:38.14]You guys aren't even using them.
[74:39.16]Get behind my shield!
[74:41.04]I see it.
[74:42.32]Get behind my shield!
[74:43.46]I move with the Grace of someone wearing perpetual ice skates.
[74:47.46]Alright, do your best Reinhardt impression.
[74:48.70]Go.
[74:49.34]Etalyx, now.
[74:51.32]No.
[74:52.34]Ster.
[74:53.80]Overwatch sucks.
[74:56.56]I can't... What are we doing?
[74:58.24]Why are we... It's trying to show us the new thing, but we're all dying.
[75:02.44]Alright, I'll go.
[75:13.66]It could have been like... A lot of characters.
[75:20.57]The silence is what's getting me right now.
[75:22.29]Alright, I gotta get that.
[75:23.09]I'm focused!
[75:28.03]Retreat!
[75:28.33]That means we did it.
[75:29.31]We did it.
[75:32.04]I can't... It's too green.
[75:34.28]What is happening?
[75:34.72]Why is there a nuke?
[75:39.36]The building's gone.
[75:40.62]What?
[75:41.18]The building's gone.
[75:43.30]Our only source of cover just vanished.
[75:45.94]Hey, there's no doubt they're aliens, guys.
[75:47.44]This is not just a World War.
[75:51.81]It is a space war.
[75:52.45]Any green crates?
[75:55.01]It's a space war!
[75:56.45]I'm trying to get the fucking crates.
[75:58.93]You guys are laughing, having a laughing about it a little bit over here.
[76:01.97]I'm trying to collect boxes.
[76:07.19]I don't think it's over.
[76:08.79]No, it just got way harder.
[76:12.40]We gotta find a new building.
[76:13.46]Yeah, we gotta change position here.
[76:16.94]You're dead?
[76:18.02]Yeah.
[76:18.34]Oh, boy!
[76:19.16]Hold on.
[76:19.84]I'm coming.
[76:22.00]I was boosting as fast as I could to keep up.
[76:26.53]Does that take health from me?
[76:29.57]I think it does.
[76:35.65]Oh, fuck.
[76:37.04]Oh, fuck.
[76:42.32]If I put my back to another building, I have more bunkers.
[76:44.92]I'm almost dead again.
[76:45.80]I got you if you do.
[76:48.90]Trying to just stay close.
[76:51.49]This is strategic command headquarters.
[76:54.39]What do you mean by hostile forces?
[76:59.17]Hostile forces?
[77:00.29]No way.
[77:03.01]I can't believe they're trying to kill us.
[77:04.79]Do you have a heal?
[77:06.44]I don't.
[77:06.98]I can't do any more heals.
[77:08.46]There's a couple boxes.
[77:09.14]That would be very convenient.
[77:10.30]Where are they?
[77:13.27]Like on the road, there's something.
[77:15.62]Heals.
[77:16.98]Yeah, there's a couple here.
[77:22.88]That's the worst part about the character you're playing.
[77:25.86]Holy shit, that takes half my health.
[77:28.78]Oh, look at this!
[77:29.44]Look at how many are here.
[77:30.32]We need to find a way out of here.
[77:31.76]Holy shit.
[77:43.15]I'm stuck on a rock.
[77:45.74]Star, any bright ideas?
[77:47.60]I'm trying to get to his shield.
[77:49.50]He's got super shield over here.
[77:51.76]Oh, help.
[77:52.70]My help.
[77:55.26]Oh, shield's already down.
[78:00.32]I don't know, dude.
[78:04.26]Yeah, there's health right next to me, actually.
[78:06.74]I'm down.
[78:08.26]It's just Germabot.
[78:09.54]Yeah, there's a health box right next to me, and there's a health box in front of Star.
[78:23.47]Alright, just don't pick me up.
[78:25.58]Your health is better spent like right now shooting things.
[78:31.02]Holy fuck.
[78:32.32]Are we getting reinforcement?
[78:33.94]They're talking about reinforcing us?
[78:38.85]I don't even know what to shoot at.
[78:39.97]There's so many.
[78:43.45]Oh boy, this is where I die.
[78:45.85]This is where it's all gone.
[78:46.87]Holy shit.
[78:52.26]I'm dead.
[78:54.79]Didn't actually mean to say thank you my headphone hit it.
[78:57.62]It's just you man No way I lose this there's a health crate I'm in I walk inside of a ship I Think we hit the gear.
[79:10.46]I think we hit the gear check mission We did get at least some more armor
[79:21.18]We did it.
[79:22.74]BMing?
[79:23.30]No, I accidentally touched the... Because we're still, like, finding loot and stuff, right?
[79:27.54]So, just apparently certain shields that are better to shield cancel for movement than others.
[79:33.98]I mean, you can always go back and we can do another one and get better.
[79:36.68]I, like, still don't have a vehicle.
[79:40.14]Dragon Lance.
[79:41.40]Interesting.
[79:44.10]Single shot, great damage.
[79:45.50]However, it requires several times the energy of a standard Power Lance.
[79:48.86]Longer charge time.
[79:50.45]Okay.
[79:53.96]Might be worth using.
[79:56.86]Both of them.
[80:07.78]Okay.
[80:10.65]Let's see.
[80:11.85]What did we get?
[80:25.42]This one.
[80:25.90]Oh, I should probably mute.
[80:28.77]Everyone else is muted.
[80:29.69]Alright, Boltgun.
[80:30.31]What's it do?
[80:30.85]New type of gun that fires multiple electric bolts at once.
[80:32.65]I want a vehicle!
[80:39.75]Boltgun, and then... Dragonlance.
[80:46.64]Um... Maybe we should try the Dragonlance.
[80:49.12]High output.
[80:51.70]Look at that thing.
[80:52.14]It's like a drill.
[80:57.62]Try it.
[81:02.80]Alright.
[81:03.40]I'm ready.
[81:04.80]Are we doing an older mission?
[81:05.88]What are we doing?
[81:06.68]We should prob- Just- Let's go back to the last mission.
[81:09.70]And... So... Can you do the last one on the heart?
[81:12.04]I'm being told that they fixed my dash cancel and it doesn't work anymore.
[81:18.12]Yeah, I heard people saying that earlier.
[81:19.76]Um... We can do that mission on easy.
[81:23.26]And then just keep playing.
[81:25.55]On easy?
[81:25.91]But don't we want to... Do you want to do it on easy, or do you want to go back and do one of the missions on hard?
[81:30.36]I kind of just want to progress.
[81:33.34]Also, yeah, I mean... Usually before, you could do, like, the first mission on hard and get higher level stuff.
[81:40.75]I think that's still the case, isn't it?
[81:43.89]Probably.
[81:44.49]Wanna try that?
[81:45.09]You wanna go back a mission and just do it on hard?
[81:46.85]But usually, I think, like, in normal difficulty, there's a weapon level cap of, like, you can't use high-level shit in normal.
[81:56.61]Yeah, it might be.
[81:57.89]But sometimes... Here, we're gonna do it.
[82:02.09]We're gonna... We're gonna do it.
[82:04.45]Hey.
[82:05.19]Naked face game.
[82:08.39]This is the... All the little bugs are gonna rush us, so I'm gonna change my shit.
[82:25.85]So how the heck are you?
[82:28.73]Me?
[82:28.95]I'm good.
[82:29.53]I'm ready.
[82:30.46]Waiting for Etalyx.
[82:33.52]So this is the last mission on Heart.
[82:38.72]No, this is one of the first missions on Heart.
[82:41.28]Please don't tell me this is the corridor mission.
[82:43.64]No, not that one.
[82:44.40]The one after that one.
[82:45.26]Because the corridor emission is stupid.
[82:46.94]So, what kind of support equipment do we eventually get?
[82:49.08]I have like two empty support slots, for example.
[82:54.05]Um, I don't, for fencer, I don't know.
[82:56.97]Yeah, I don't remember them having support.
[82:58.65]I don't recall.
[83:01.55]Alright, let's try the bolt gun.
[83:05.96]Oh, okay.
[83:06.92]You're hurting me.
[83:08.30]I am?
[83:09.68]EDF teaches you pretty early on to go back and farm now that repeated weapons get upgraded.
[83:14.64]So I guess if you find the same weapon again, it upgrades.
[83:18.14]That's cool.
[83:19.64]Alright, so I guess two auto cannons is better than one.
[83:25.55]Ooh, this thing is actually really great.
[83:29.75]It's a great single target weapon.
[83:34.48]Dragonlance was a good choice.
[83:35.56]Whoever suggested it, thanks for the suggestion.
[83:38.82]Doesn't go that far though.
[83:42.39]It's still a normal?
[83:43.29]What?
[83:43.51]Did you not change it?
[83:45.71]Definitely set it to hard.
[83:47.61]Did you confirm it?
[83:48.09]I don't know how you could tell that it's still a normal.
[83:57.95]I'm not seeing very many crates.
[84:00.47]These are so slow.
[84:01.63]These are so heavy.
[84:05.14]Wait, what?
[84:05.70]It says there's one right here, but there's not.
[84:10.88]Oh boy.
[84:11.34]Well, I'm just... I'm getting the armor.
[84:14.58]Alright, well there's a weapon crate.
[84:22.04]Well, this definitely doesn't feel harder.
[84:27.58]Crap!
[84:39.82]I think it only goes into one person.
[84:42.48]Yeah, it does.
[84:47.32]It does, but I am collecting.
[84:52.34]This thing... I'd rather just use the other lightning gun.
[85:01.62]Wait, why are our combat suits acid resistant?
[85:03.72]When have we ever had to deal with acid things before?
[85:09.34]It's in the lore.
[85:12.08]I don't think so.
[85:19.75]There's a weapon over here.
[85:22.19]It's so hard to aim.
[85:26.30]You don't see it anywhere to buy?
[85:28.32]Yeah, for some weird reason, this game is not featured anywhere on the PlayStation Store.
[85:31.84]You have to go looking for it.
[85:32.78]No, you have to look for it.
[85:34.44]You have to purposefully search it.
[85:37.43]Oh, God.
[85:38.67]In 2018, you have to search for your game?
[85:40.93]Well, I mean, you actually have to go into, like, all games.
[85:43.13]Hey, actually, though, if you go to the Epic Games Store, then there's no search bar.
[85:46.49]So I think they're figuring it out that it's 2018.
[85:49.11]You shouldn't have to search for games anymore.
[85:53.53]What's with this thing?
[85:56.09]I don't want to talk about stores.
[85:59.08]I want to talk about monsters to shoot with our monster guns.
[86:07.59]Alright, basically no one by this game.
[86:09.63]That guy just come on comms and say, it's okay if you're a civilian.
[86:14.83]What?
[86:16.05]Alright, I'm searching.
[86:18.42]I'm searching, scanning the area.
[86:20.22]I'm scanning.
[86:20.72]I see one red box.
[86:22.72]I can't wait to get a good view of this.
[86:23.64]Look at this one.
[86:33.21]nice dude I want to see a I want to see a mock-up of like who got the most kills a mock-up you don't want to see that you'd be very disappointed because it's not you think it's you it's not me it's going to be uh what what are you talking about we're talking about the epic game store and how excuse me I thought we were not talking about game stories yeah you just said that yeah you did just say that
[87:02.35]We were talking about the epic game.
[87:05.77]You guys know that I installed Fortnite yesterday?
[87:08.31]And opened it to the menu.
[87:09.11]Doesn't it make you install Fortnite?
[87:11.81]I did.
[87:12.95]Why?
[87:13.19]Because every time I died in Hotline Miami, I was going to play a round of Fortnite.
[87:17.12]Oh.
[87:17.18]And then I died like 335 times.
[87:19.12]That's a lot of Fortnite games.
[87:19.80]Yeah, that was a lot.
[87:20.40]The stream was like 65 days long.
[87:29.23]Oh, you're the W. God, I thought the W was weapon.
[87:32.87]Fortnite and Ws in the same sentence?
[87:34.88]Excuse me.
[87:36.22]What stream am I on?
[87:36.94]What are you talking about?
[87:39.50]On the map, for me, you're a W. W. You are a W. There is an A. Oh, yes.
[87:46.87]I'm not even on the map.
[87:47.71]No, you're an F.
[87:49.85]F. That's accurate.
[87:51.21]So he's the A for A student, F for F student, and then W for weirdo.
[87:59.51]Can you please not?
[88:01.07]You said today you were going to be good.
[88:02.60]I did say that.
[88:03.30]I did say I was going to be, like, good today.
[88:05.70]What is good?
[88:06.36]No, I didn't.
[88:06.98]I didn't fucking say that.
[88:07.96]I'm not even going to perpetuate that bullshit.
[88:09.52]I didn't say anything.
[88:10.30]You just lied twice.
[88:16.94]Don't you know that 85%... Who can trust him now?
[88:20.14]85% of everything I ever say on stream is not true.
[88:23.45]We've already talked about this.
[88:24.91]Is that true?
[88:26.55]I don't know!
[88:27.03]Is that 15%?
[88:28.83]I don't know.
[88:29.93]You have to figure that out.
[88:35.51]So, is this part of the Ask Me Anything?
[88:38.15]Could be.
[88:38.75]It is now.
[88:42.51]No, I'm not gonna go peek at Alex's mic.
[88:45.42]So how much truth are you doing right now?
[88:47.63]Is that a lie too?
[88:50.33]You need to watch Interstellar?
[88:52.97]Hey, don't spoil that movie, I haven't seen it.
[88:56.65]I'm going to change your parameters.
[88:58.61]Holy shit, there's so many things over there, get it!
[89:05.38]Got it.
[89:08.54]Ooh, okay, there we go.
[89:10.12]Now that's what I'm talking about.
[89:11.48]Mad weapons, MAD WEAPONS!
[89:17.13]Yeah, I got a bunch of the same shit.
[89:20.55]Mirage Zero.
[89:21.63]Homing Weapon.
[89:24.21]Leveled up.
[89:25.03]Alright.
[89:25.77]That's pretty good.
[89:28.31]Turbo Core.
[89:29.17]Leveled up.
[89:31.42]Yeah.
[89:31.96]For some... You have to click Apply Settings when you change the difficulty.
[89:37.62]Level up power units.
[89:39.50]Spark Vine.
[89:40.00]Level up.
[89:40.46]Energy cost is down.
[89:41.70]That's good.
[89:42.14]Why?
[89:43.39]More capacity, a lot more capacity for the machine gun.
[89:45.87]So do you want to try and do that on hard or no?
[89:47.79]We could.
[89:51.25]Okay, I'm putting on hard and I'm applying the setting.
[89:54.06]Also, this means there's friendly fire now.
[89:55.78]Okay, which mission is this?
[89:57.52]Sorry.
[89:57.80]The same one we just did.
[89:58.72]Okay, so... Interesting.
[90:00.20]All land-based.
[90:03.26]Okay.
[90:13.72]I guess I can have a grenade.
[90:20.40]Okay.
[90:22.34]Bowgun, I'm not a fan of.
[90:23.69]Maybe when it's upgraded, it's better.
[90:24.93]Mmm.
[90:31.53]Ooh!
[90:31.87]I feel like this would be not... Looks like we're waiting on a couple other people to ready up right now.
[90:35.51]Yeah, but hold on.
[90:36.07]Aye, aye, aye, aye.
[90:38.29]Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.
[90:39.41]Aye, aye, aye, aye.
[90:40.11]Yeah, I'm gonna kill you guys.
[90:44.21]What?
[90:44.39]What the fuck are you talking about?
[90:45.69]All three of my equipment are artillery.
[90:47.47]Oh, fuck.
[90:48.41]Do I get like a... Do I get friendly fires on and harder?
[90:52.09]It shows you, and then you can move.
[90:53.61]Okay.
[90:55.65]That was just... That was really... That was a weird way to start that.
[90:59.54]I'm gonna go kill you guys.
[91:02.76]I'm gonna kill you guys.
[91:04.26]Stop!
[91:07.34]Stop this!
[91:09.40]I'm the one that's supposed to be good today.
[91:14.78]What?
[91:15.18]What does it have to do with anything?
[91:16.84]You both are talking about killing me.
[91:18.96]Yeah, well, you haven't been very good.
[91:22.40]There's only one of us that would actually do that, though.
[91:31.95]Whoa.
[91:33.95]And it's not me.
[91:35.73]But, you know, I don't have motive, but I do have opportunity.
[91:39.73]Oh, I accidentally did the other one.
[91:42.28]What do you mean accident?
[91:42.96]What did you accidentally do?
[91:44.34]I moved the mission forward and I didn't approve of it.
[91:48.93]Why are you doing this to us?
[91:52.91]Are we restarting?
[91:54.83]No.
[91:59.15]I wish I could shoot my gatling at the same time as the mortar.
[92:03.05]I should be able to destroy these pretty easily with the shit I have.
[92:07.97]Well.
[92:10.67]You ain't.
[92:16.53]Actually, I kind of don't mind this is really this is really just brainless country.
[92:20.31]It's just these blocks on and homings So the matter last weapons So The weapon boxes have actually appear on the mini-map Or do you just have to spot them?
[92:38.02]They appear on the ground
[92:41.09]I know they're on the ground.
[92:42.19]I'm asking if... Okay.
[92:43.45]I think maybe the green dots are... You were jokingly saying, I'm going to kill you, but you did.
[92:49.17]I didn't mean to.
[92:53.19]But you did.
[92:54.23]And that did not last very long.
[92:56.83]So, I wonder, is Star the one that's killing us?
[92:59.90]No, I'm the one that's winning the mission.
[93:01.38]Do you have heals anymore?
[93:04.84]No.
[93:06.42]Oh.
[93:08.64]I guess I'll just dive out.
[93:11.52]I just landed on my neck.
[93:16.00]I just got blown up by your extreme explosion.
[93:19.07]All you got to do is not stand next to the pylon.
[93:21.31]Hey, all you got to do is not lay it down on top of our name tag, which is visible.
[93:25.31]I'm not.
[93:25.99]I keep throwing them on the pylon.
[93:28.00]You fucking boober.
[93:29.38]Alright, pick me up.
[93:31.36]I'm taking off the weapon chest.
[93:35.64]I think we get shit even if we fail.
[93:37.16]Just don't die, forehead.
[93:43.65]Just don't die, forehead.
[93:44.83]Let me get full health and I'll come rescue you.
[93:49.07]I can't damage these myself.
[93:53.67]I only have artillery.
[93:57.67]I'm trying to get as many things as I can.
[94:01.53]I think even if we die, we get them.
[94:03.15]Because last time, when we failed that, um... The air... The UFO one, we still got shit.
[94:10.19]I just need, like, a second.
[94:13.90]Boom!
[94:14.28]Alright, I'm just gonna stay up here for a second and just take a look.
[94:18.08]Any more crates?
[94:19.26]I'll get down over the pylon, this crate.
[94:23.73]I'm gonna try to get some.
[94:24.49]A singular ant can kill me.
[94:27.05]Yeah, they do a lot of damage because it's hard.
[94:29.79]I don't have a cool guy dodge roll.
[94:33.28]I have just, I jump one time.
[94:36.95]Be aware of that happening.
[94:38.75]Oh my god.
[94:49.13]Okay.
[94:49.73]Are you doing it again?
[94:50.35]No.
[94:51.13]Okay.
[94:52.57]Jeez Louise, man.
[94:54.27]If you want me to, I can.
[94:56.61]Alright, I'm coming.
[94:57.17]I'm dying over here.
[94:58.13]I'm coming back there now.
[94:59.35]I had to pick up stuff at the pylon.
[95:02.23]Oh, whoops.
[95:03.65]What the fuck are you doing?
[95:05.82]You just panicked me.
[95:06.56]You panicked me.
[95:07.12]You made me press my button and I fucking hurt myself.
[95:14.08]I meant to cancel the throw, but it doesn't.
[95:16.56]It didn't.
[95:23.83]Stop calling me a civilian.
[95:26.17]Alright, are we okay?
[95:29.11]No.
[95:29.57]No, there's a bunch of ants coming at me.
[95:32.67]Well, do something about it.
[95:35.50]I don't have any guns.
[95:36.38]I'm a civilian.
[95:37.14]Yeah, are you actually?
[95:41.58]You just laser yourself?
[95:43.16]Yeah.
[95:47.93]I'm just gonna hide in this bush.
[95:51.35]I'm almost out of power.
[95:53.27]I'm out of power.
[95:55.85]I need more power.
[95:58.11]Oh.
[95:59.25]Can you kill, like, one thing?
[96:00.81]You don't understand.
[96:01.45]It's very hard for me to do what I'm doing right now.
[96:05.79]I have to wait.
[96:06.15]If you kill one thing, I get more bombs.
[96:08.15]I mean, yes, I did.
[96:09.27]I killed five.
[96:11.13]And now it's going to kill me.
[96:12.03]No, don't.
[96:15.00]Oh, I see.
[96:17.08]That's why I can't dash or jump, because those are my support items I have yet to unlock.
[96:23.52]I'm just gonna break my fucking controller in my bare hands.
[96:27.62]Okay.
[96:29.08]Do we get any items?
[96:33.11]We did.
[96:33.59]Alright, look at these, though.
[96:36.11]That's a level 2.
[96:39.67]Pulse Machine Gun R. Yeah, I didn't really get anything good.
[96:44.74]For me.
[96:45.80]It's the same shit.
[96:48.54]Look at that.
[96:51.56]Smaller range, but better.
[96:53.66]Pulse Machine Gun R. R for really good.
[97:02.87]Uh, the big cannon is kind of hard to use.
[97:07.09]Yeah, look at this.
[97:10.87]This is huge.
[97:11.59]Increase 9 damage to 12.
[97:16.63]Faster rate of fire.
[97:17.77]Okay, we're doing the not pylon one on hard.
[97:21.34]I feel like I'd rather just use the... Let me see what this thing does.
[97:30.66]I think I'm just, yeah, I'm just going to keep shields on permanently.
[97:42.47]I'll go back to the shotgun.
[97:45.23]Yeah, shotgun seems pretty decent here, actually.
[97:48.43]I also have one.
[97:56.09]Jermis should play Dante Must Die.
[97:58.13]DMC.
[98:05.72]Oh, did you hear the drama about the new Devil May Cry?
[98:09.22]No, I did not.
[98:12.08]What drama?
[98:14.02]I don't think there is any.
[98:15.40]Oh, let's make some.
[98:17.12]Wait, hold on.
[98:18.34]You're just making that up.
[98:21.06]Well, we are now.
[98:21.62]There's this really weird intro sequence scene where he just starts slapping women and saying really sexist things.
[98:31.09]What's wrong with your brain?
[98:33.73]What's wrong with Dante?
[98:36.15]That's a great question.
[98:39.11]I hope that Team Ninja answers for this.
[98:49.85]Alright, here we go.
[98:56.48]Alright, grit shot.
[99:00.17]I can hear that.
[99:00.63]Let me see if I can hear again.
[99:04.58]I could hear that.
[99:05.88]They say only people under a certain age can hear that noise.
[99:09.00]Only dogs.
[99:10.26]Only dogs.
[99:11.84]Dogs are if you're young enough, you can hear that.
[99:14.00]Dogs.
[99:14.66]Alright, I'm going to do something.
[99:17.88]Tell me if your dog does anything.
[99:19.34]I'm going to put that as my ringtone during class.
[99:26.68]I'm going to try and not kill you.
[99:28.66]Please don't.
[99:30.68]That is what set me down the death spiral last time.
[99:35.76]This thing's actually pretty effective.
[99:39.32]Look at the boxes.
[99:41.86]Bobos.
[99:42.66]Bobos.
[99:44.76]What?
[99:47.89]There's a bunch of weapon crates over here.
[99:50.39]I'm going around collecting them.
[99:52.35]Okay, I'm bombing these guys.
[99:56.27]I'm staying near you because I don't think you'll bomb yourself.
[100:01.87]He would.
[100:02.27]He already did it.
[100:03.21]He did already do that.
[100:05.70]Did he bomb himself?
[100:06.76]Oh, yeah.
[100:08.22]Yes, he did.
[100:08.70]Last mission.
[100:09.54]No.
[100:09.88]It shows you.
[100:11.70]Actually, I did last mission.
[100:12.84]Yes, you did.
[100:13.58]That was an accident.
[100:16.26]So it happened at least once.
[100:22.17]Hold on.
[100:22.55]I see a weapon.
[100:32.33]Alright.
[100:32.75]Collecting.
[100:34.05]Two weapons.
[100:36.01]No, I want them.
[100:36.71]Okay, can you guys kill these ants?
[100:40.61]Like, these dinosaurs?
[100:42.45]Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, mouth dry.
[100:47.53]Stop calling me!
[100:49.03]Oh god, that poor guy.
[100:51.77]Shit, arrived.
[100:52.97]I'm dead, dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead!
[100:56.29]Oh my god, this is not what I'm aiming at!
[100:59.12]Oh, you're dead, dead.
[101:03.29]Watch out, I'm bombing you.
[101:05.55]What, maybe actually good.
[101:06.51]Maybe they'll knock me over near a tower.
[101:10.95]Jarvis is stealing all the guns.
[101:12.07]It's shared.
[101:13.24]I am putting myself... See, it helped.
[101:15.50]I'm putting myself in harm's way to get all the items.
[101:18.06]I'm coming.
[101:20.12]And then I get bonked.
[101:22.06]Oop, I almost shot you.
[101:23.18]I may have shot you.
[101:26.40]Alright, I'm here.
[101:30.80]Someone just said, I'm good.
[101:31.94]I want you guys to know that.
[101:34.74]I mean, you are, but... You are good.
[101:38.58]But, like... Only at very specific things.
[101:44.52]Like what?
[101:45.76]Table tennis.
[101:49.10]You are good at table tennis.
[101:50.56]You are?
[101:52.68]That's about it.
[101:57.14]I heard that.
[101:58.08]I heard that.
[102:05.27]Okay, easy.
[102:16.07]Anything over there?
[102:17.71]Yeah, they survived through my airstrike, Mark.
[102:21.38]Geez.
[102:21.82]Oh, boy.
[102:23.08]Oh, geez.
[102:24.26]Oh, boy.
[102:25.10]Oh, geez.
[102:31.92]There are too many enemies, I would agree.
[102:37.81]Jeez!
[102:40.09]It's weird hearing that twice.
[102:43.95]Oh, jeez!
[102:44.69]Oh, zoinks!
[102:52.88]I gotta stay in the air!
[102:56.54]I am also trying to stay in the air.
[102:59.09]I got another... Okay, it's time to do or die.
[103:04.15]Are you bombing yourself?
[103:05.97]Yes.
[103:09.38]That's a sun suit tactic.
[103:11.96]God damn it.
[103:14.58]God!
[103:16.02]Danger close.
[103:17.72]I'm coming!
[103:19.40]This is danger close.
[103:21.72]I feel like this game's harder than last game.
[103:24.96]personally.
[103:26.35]Oh my god.
[103:27.25]I got you, get up.
[103:27.93]Why did you resurrect me?
[103:29.27]Because we need you.
[103:31.55]I'm dead.
[103:33.66]I distracted a bunch of them though, now they're all coming for you.
[103:38.70]Hold on, I can still get stuff.
[103:41.73]Yeah, just pick stuff up.
[103:51.00]They're all coming over here.
[103:53.16]Just pick up as much as you can, then die.
[103:54.70]I have an idea, though.
[103:56.74]What if I bring them all over here?
[103:57.82]And then we're going to go for it.
[104:00.63]Here we go.
[104:00.97]Ready?
[104:05.27]Hold on.
[104:05.97]We're ready.
[104:06.85]Oh.
[104:11.70]This is not going to take long to just die again.
[104:13.64]Yep.
[104:15.74]Welcome back.
[104:17.04]Red Wizard.
[104:20.39]Don't worry about me for a sec.
[104:22.83]Welcome back.
[104:24.13]Three warrior.
[104:26.19]Is playing a man down change the spawn or no?
[104:31.55]Like, are we playing a four player tuned... Yeah, we're playing a man down and nothing changes because of that.
[104:36.63]Oh.
[104:37.95]Yeah, I guess that helps explain.
[104:40.46]Any more items?
[104:42.06]It's like playing Monster Hunter: World without the cats.
[104:47.60]I see that explosion about to happen.
[104:56.16]Is that done?
[104:56.90]Is the explosion over?
[104:58.58]Yeah.
[104:59.96]You'll see the red on the ground.
[105:03.96]I'm sorry.
[105:05.84]Oh my god!
[105:06.90]I mean, if you just lie forever, you should be able to kill him eventually.
[105:11.36]That's true.
[105:11.86]This is the last wave, I think.
[105:14.76]Yeah, this does seem like the final wave.
[105:17.20]You just have to get good.
[105:19.22]I'm handling things, don't worry.
[105:20.78]Do you want me to resurrect anybody?
[105:23.42]Just so you have to stay good.
[105:24.94]Oh, they're up on the building!
[105:28.51]I can still, like, see the vomit of projectiles.
[105:39.06]God damn it!
[105:41.84]Stop singing!
[105:42.94]You're covering my screen with, like, fucking notifications!
[105:50.15]You've got, like, annotations all over my screen and it's fucking me up!
[105:54.55]There's cheese puffs following you.
[105:59.06]Oh my god.
[106:05.24]EDF!
[106:05.38]You got this.
[106:06.54]I need to wait.
[106:07.08]I need to get... Look, just don't get hit.
[106:11.61]Oh no, what did I do?
[106:13.15]Mistake!
[106:14.01]Mistake!
[106:14.79]Mistake!
[106:16.17]Mistake!
[106:18.81]Mistake!
[106:21.15]Mistake.
[106:22.65]Oh, I like playing this game with the soundboard enabled by default.
[106:28.44]You just jump by me.
[106:29.48]Look how much health you got.
[106:30.66]How many times did I say help me?
[106:33.35]And you just go right by me.
[106:34.45]Yeah, don't res me, res him.
[106:36.13]He can call down an airstrike.
[106:37.55]Do you want to be resurrected?
[106:39.37]I thought I was supposed to just run away and kill them.
[106:41.71]There was no reason not to get me up.
[106:43.47]Okay, well then fucking... There we go!
[106:45.88]One, two, three!
[106:51.22]I panicked, hold on.
[106:53.10]Let's count to three again.
[106:55.40]One... Listen, help me too.
[107:03.76]Three.
[107:04.74]Do it.
[107:19.52]Help me!
[107:25.37]Ooh, nice airstrike.
[107:26.45]Look at all those ants get demolished.
[107:32.36]How many more people are left?
[107:33.34]Dude, I am the GPS.
[107:34.34]I can get you.
[107:35.16]I can get you.
[107:35.63]Alright, Etalyx.
[107:38.17]I'm going to get you.
[107:43.19]Where the fuck are you?
[107:45.79]Oh, you're... Oh, I'm over here.
[107:48.67]Hey, what's up?
[107:49.21]Alright, I'm down again.
[107:49.91]Let's do it.
[107:50.57]But there's like, there's not very many left.
[107:51.81]I'll be down again in about two seconds as well.
[107:54.10]There's only like six.
[107:56.76]There's seven.
[107:57.26]There's seven.
[107:57.78]You guys can kill seven.
[107:58.70]Don't put pressure on me.
[107:59.58]Say there's like a hundred.
[108:01.80]There's a hundred, Jerma.
[108:02.62]You have to res me.
[108:04.22]Okay, I'll get you.
[108:09.59]No, fuck this.
[108:10.47]Let me prove that I'm capable.
[108:26.48]Quiet, that's no noise.
[108:29.06]Oh my God, I'm losing my mind.
[108:30.85]You can just do it.
[108:31.85]Just get over here, both of you, I don't even care.
[108:39.11]Wow, that was like an anime resurrection.
[108:43.55]You just whizzed by me, it was crazy.
[108:45.15]Alright, well I have a shotgun and a mortar, so.
[108:53.00]Alright, I'm coming.
[108:53.56]I think you did it.
[108:54.46]Oh, no!
[108:56.24]Grab as many boxes as you can!
[109:00.46]There's another wave?
[109:01.26]Oh, God.
[109:03.97]Oh, no.
[109:04.73]It's the double wave.
[109:05.81]It's like the super wave.
[109:07.27]I'm going.
[109:07.57]I'm running away.
[109:08.13]I'm going on a building.
[109:09.47]Oh, no.
[109:11.85]I'm making my last stand.
[109:17.87]Oh.
[109:18.17]My.
[109:18.63]God.
[109:20.21]What the fuck have I done?
[109:31.74]Well, the mechs are online, for whatever that's worth.
[109:35.82]Alright, hold on, hold on.
[109:37.24]This might not be terrible.
[109:40.53]There is a health pack right next to me as well.
[109:42.61]Okay, hold on.
[109:43.29]Oh my god, what?
[109:43.91]I have a long thing to put.
[109:45.85]Health pack right next to you, Tox?
[109:47.43]Yeah.
[109:47.77]Coming in.
[109:54.62]Honestly, then I get my artillery back when things die.
[109:59.22]So because there were more things, I could just... I just spammed them.
[110:02.50]We did it!
[110:02.88]Oh, fuck!
[110:05.62]I see a weapon.
[110:06.30]Get ready!
[110:06.78]I can't get it.
[110:08.24]What the fuck?
[110:08.68]Two weapons.
[110:11.62]Three weapon.
[110:12.28]Did I get it?
[110:13.86]Oh, I just almost pulled my whole monitor down.
[110:16.85]Level five items.
[110:18.47]I got powered exoskeletons.
[110:19.81]We're good now.
[110:21.11]We did it.
[110:22.33]Etalyx.
[110:23.09]High five, Etalyx.
[110:24.23]You did it.
[110:25.45]You did it, Etalyx.
[110:27.63]Hey, but now we have better stuff.
[110:29.43]Like, you couldn't have won without me distracting half the enemies for the two seconds it took me to die each time.
[110:37.72]You might consider switching to Ranger.
[110:40.44]Just because, like, Fencer is just so... You need to, like, beat them up.
[110:43.59]People were saying you get movement things on your support options later.
[110:47.81]Well, what did you just get?
[110:48.85]Because you should have got some higher level stuff for that class.
[110:52.81]I did get Enhanced Boosters.
[110:54.33]Add Booster 1.
[110:55.05]Well, that sounds good.
[111:00.22]Shorten the Phalanx.
[111:02.64]That's a lot better.
[111:07.26]Better version of the Pulse Machine Gun R, the thing we were just using.
[111:11.98]better though if you do want to play ranger I can also summon a exoskeleton you can drive it now oh that kind of sounds fun top secret super weapon it's very existence is classified there's oh I think I want that oh that's better osmocore
[111:41.17]That's called B. Ooh.
[111:43.93]Are we doing the aerial mission again, or want to do another one on hard or something?
[111:51.44]You want to try the one we just did?
[111:53.80]A bacon discharger discharges cooked bacon.
[111:56.40]Okay.
[111:58.20]So, same mission?
[111:59.34]Did you say bacon launcher?
[112:01.12]Yeah.
[112:04.29]Can I get a confirmation same mission?
[112:05.91]Hold on.
[112:06.37]I'm trying to decide if I want to switch classes.
[112:09.22]Yeah, let's give him a second to figure that out.
[112:11.86]Because I have one extra booster.
[112:13.60]Is that really going to be like the difference maker in my whole class?
[112:17.44]Well, what was the other stuff you leveled up?
[112:20.14]For that mission, I only got like a level five shield and add one booster.
[112:27.07]Yeah, I don't know.
[112:31.31]Switch, play Ranger.
[112:32.43]Okay.
[112:35.05]I wonder what I should use right now.
[112:38.80]Yeah, we can do the same mission and I can summon you the mech and you can play Ranger.
[112:43.43]Lightning Bow.
[112:49.81]It's 107 per second.
[112:52.95]If things are better across the board.
[112:54.27]Let's try the super weapon and then their upgraded Lightning Bow.
[113:03.02]I wonder how cool this thing is.
[113:09.71]Oh shit, that does so much more damage.
[113:12.41]I was like, I don't want to use the dumb limpet gun, but it's like a level three and does so much more than everything else.
[113:22.44]I'm ready.
[113:22.88]Are you going to try, Ranger?
[113:28.90]It doesn't hurt just to try it for one mission.
[113:30.75]Yeah.
[113:32.07]It really, it's a lot of like projectile explosives, rocket launchers, grenades, that type of stuff.
[113:38.87]Machine guns.
[113:40.77]Some of their weapons are okay, but they're basic.
[113:45.12]It's a very balanced, basic class that has good weapons, you know?
[113:50.86]The fencer is, oh, wow, dash around.
[113:52.82]You're huge.
[113:53.80]You have these big arm cannons and lances.
[113:57.19]You get to fly if you play the wing diver.
[114:00.39]The air raider, vehicles and big explosions.
[114:02.67]Rangers just, I have weapons and I shoot them.
[114:05.60]And that's it.
[114:14.74]Alright, let's give it a try.
[114:15.39]Also, since you can just ride my mech, you can just do that the whole mission.
[114:18.33]Okay.
[114:19.13]We'll give it a try.
[114:19.85]Because it's a level 5 mech.
[114:22.55]I'll be able to actually walk without ice skating.
[114:25.49]Oh no, this thing is going to be slow as hell.
[114:27.46]Jupiter Storm.
[114:29.56]Yeah.
[114:32.22]You guys, but you, come on, you got to put like whooshes in the middle.
[114:35.98]Whoosh?
[114:37.22]Like that's, if there's a storm, there's going to be rain, lightning.
[114:47.12]Wait, so I... Let's see how this thing works.
[114:50.06]Oh, I can't summon you yet.
[114:55.04]That takes a long... Oh my god, okay.
[114:57.00]How long does it last?
[114:59.44]That lasts a long time.
[115:08.99]This thing just shoots Mike-a-nikes everywhere.
[115:10.97]Alright.
[115:14.05]Okay.
[115:14.29]Let me get used to these new controls here.
[115:25.10]This thing's pretty cool now.
[115:26.82]You're good.
[115:28.26]You're good, guys.
[115:29.14]No, you're good.
[115:35.35]That's like an insane person.
[115:39.49]Time for revenge!
[115:41.25]Time for revenge!
[115:47.81]This thing... This thing is so inaccurate.
[115:50.37]This thing is so... This thing is... so... Do I have to, like, not be moving?
[115:55.71]I can't zoom with it.
[116:01.60]You just shred.
[116:04.28]I think this thing shreds.
[116:07.92]Why am I using that term?
[116:09.34]Civilian, um, civilian Ster.
[116:11.34]How do you choose between jumping and dodge rolling?
[116:14.48]Uh, you have to hold left to dodge, usually.
[116:18.12]Okay, so I'm holding L2, and sometimes it rolls, and sometimes it jumps.
[116:21.94]Yeah, rolling is left and right.
[116:24.19]Oh, I see.
[116:24.89]Jumping is any other.
[116:29.19]I cast off these petty illusions.
[116:34.77]So where's that awesome mech?
[116:37.15]I have to kill enough things.
[116:39.95]Like, we have to, as a team, kill enough things before I can summon it.
[116:43.01]It's about 75%.
[116:49.21]No, no, no, why'd you do?
[116:50.61]What are you doing to me?
[116:52.03]I don't even know you're doing this oh Did you get bombed almost it takes a long time to come in your time?
[116:58.80]Get initiated Oh
[117:12.13]Not at all.
[117:14.93]It's actually like crazy.
[117:16.55]Yeah, it's really good.
[117:21.73]Because their projectiles are so slow by comparison.
[117:24.34]Get out of the dirt, Ant.
[117:25.18]Yeah, it's kind of like Dark Souls.
[117:28.96]Hey, I played that.
[117:30.20]You played that game?
[117:30.74]Yeah, it's like the Souls of Ant Sim.
[117:34.34]The Souls of Ant Sim.
[117:37.76]Yeah.
[117:38.26]What the hell is that?
[117:42.98]There is like a SimAnt game, right?
[117:44.86]Yeah, I tried to play it.
[117:45.72]Yeah.
[117:47.62]Good game.
[117:48.40]It's very old.
[117:48.96]Alright.
[117:51.52]That's the identifying characteristic.
[117:54.16]It's old.
[117:55.24]SimAnt.
[117:55.68]Yeah, I played that once.
[117:56.56]It's old.
[118:00.92]Right through the front door.
[118:03.54]One, two, get it out there.
[118:06.96]Okay, I'm almost sort of kind of at the point where I could maybe summon this thing that I wanted to have.
[118:15.03]Looks like, um... Does it matter if you burst fire or just hold the button down?
[118:22.21]Uh, for accuracy?
[118:25.18]Yeah, for accuracy.
[118:27.26]That's a good question.
[118:34.64]I'm just stinging.
[118:40.19]Get away from me.
[118:41.89]Okay, I can summon the thing.
[118:43.33]Alright, let me find you.
[118:47.93]I'm going to take this opportunity to pick up this stuff.
[118:49.80]There's a lot of health over here.
[118:51.18]Just make sure if you need health, you come over this way.
[118:54.18]I need that defuser.
[119:01.78]It's terrifying.
[119:03.88]I'm coming.
[119:04.24]I need it.
[119:04.80]I need it.
[119:10.83]Oh, yeah.
[119:12.01]Yeah, walk into it.
[119:13.13]Come on.
[119:14.47]I'm actually way better at killing things as a ranger.
[119:17.77]Where the fuck is my... thing?
[119:29.37]I try to keep them around this thing so they just die eventually.
[119:34.58]And not summoning it.
[119:37.06]Okay, what?
[119:38.80]I assumed it was the same button to revive people because it said that the vehicle button.
[119:43.14]Oh, I'm going towards the smoke.
[119:45.28]Stand fall for Titanfall.
[119:48.22]Stand fall.
[119:50.54]I'll come back to you guys.
[119:52.05]Will I get smashed?
[119:53.83]I think so.
[119:54.19]Okay, I kind of want to do it.
[119:59.21]Nope, it didn't smash the bug.
[120:03.69]There it is.
[120:04.87]Go get it.
[120:07.56]Yes!
[120:08.32]Alright, let's see it.
[120:08.98]I've been powered up.
[120:10.28]Why do you have, like, silly string on your hands?
[120:12.06]Oh god.
[120:13.50]I don't know.
[120:13.94]I think it has limited ammo, so be aware of that.
[120:16.84]Hold on.
[120:17.43]Is it the same buttons to shoot?
[120:20.51]This thing is so slow.
[120:22.61]Yeah, they're really slow.
[120:24.45]But as long as you stay there... I think I'm doing that.
[120:26.25]There are so many!
[120:29.41]Any more armor?
[120:30.33]Oh boy.
[120:31.89]Any more crates?
[120:32.87]Ooh!
[120:33.53]That I didn't see before?
[120:34.45]There's a jump button.
[120:39.12]What does R1, L1 do?
[120:40.34]I don't even see my grenade that I'm supposedly firing.
[120:48.43]Dude, my game rate just went down.
[120:49.89]My frame rate just went down so much.
[120:51.75]My game rate!
[120:53.05]My game rate just went down.
[120:54.41]Alright, time to collect.
[120:59.55]How are you supposed to walk in a straight line?
[121:05.77]Mech is drunk.
[121:06.67]Oh my god.
[121:07.17]I gave my mech to the fucking newbie To be fair This has two guns on it one is a grenade launcher which all the grenades have a fuse and the second gun is like Dragon Ball Z
[121:27.78]Start picking up boxes.
[121:29.36]Oh, that's what I'm doing!
[121:30.28]Don't kill them all, it's box time.
[121:32.88]That's what I'm doing for the last, like, two straight minutes.
[121:36.56]If I pick up health in the mech, do I heal?
[121:40.16]Um, maybe?
[121:44.94]But yeah, there's two separate control schemes here.
[121:50.08]Fucking noob.
[121:50.62]Alright, I got Buster.
[121:54.10]Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[122:00.13]Well, I got different ones now.
[122:03.87]And I got the Armored Vehicle Grape!
[122:05.61]I'm just playing Scout in Man vs. Machine.
[122:11.50]In a sense.
[122:14.12]Dude, I love the Grape.
[122:16.48]The Glepnir.
[122:19.38]The Gleepnir.
[122:20.28]That's a level 5 special.
[122:25.70]Okay.
[122:26.50]The Destroyer Blaster!
[122:29.11]Well, looks or the Lightning Bow M2.
[122:31.61]We got some toys to play with.
[122:34.67]Why can I hear myself every time?
[122:36.89]Sorry, that was me.
[122:39.05]I can just hear myself every time.
[122:40.87]You got very loud.
[122:42.92]Well, you keep peaking your mic.
[122:45.78]No, I don't.
[122:48.64]Power Lance, more range.
[122:52.20]That's a lot more capacity.
[122:53.74]Oh, boy.
[122:54.34]I just found six new weapons.
[122:56.80]So many toys.
[122:57.46]Okay.
[122:57.56]Okay, yeah, yeah.
[122:58.96]One raven.
[123:03.82]Okay.
[123:05.66]Assault rifle.
[123:06.76]That's the M2.
[123:09.56]Pump action shotgun.
[123:10.60]Alright.
[123:12.20]Damn.
[123:13.86]Plasma fall.
[123:14.68]Damn!
[123:16.22]Mirage zero.
[123:17.28]Damn!
[123:19.90]Gleapnir.
[123:22.78]Discharges a ball of energy.
[123:26.02]Missiles that home in on nearby enemies.
[123:28.20]Okay.
[123:32.86]Scout bomber.
[123:33.94]Alright.
[123:40.63]So, would you like to go back and do the aerial mission?
[123:43.17]Think we're ready?
[123:44.37]I think we might be ready.
[123:47.95]I think I agree.
[123:51.23]For the aerial...
[123:53.50]I'm debating between taking a second assault rifle or, if we're gonna hide under the building again, a shotgun.
[124:00.14]Are we gonna do the hide under building thing until the last phase?
[124:03.07]I wanna try my new toys.
[124:04.25]I don't know.
[124:05.29]I think we might be strong enough to not have to hide, but who knows?
[124:09.05]I'm gonna bring the healer with us again.
[124:14.55]Destroyer blaster.
[124:15.72]Plasma fall.
[124:28.41]Only one capacity, though.
[124:33.49]No, that's just too big.
[124:34.44]I'm gonna try with this, the new lightning bolt.
[124:38.60]And then this crazy weapon.
[124:39.68]I have a heal now, I think.
[124:43.52]Heal subordinate soldiers.
[124:45.20]I'm gonna try the new weapons.
[124:46.30]You hear that?
[124:47.06]Subordinate.
[124:49.16]Can you put on actual armor?
[124:51.54]No, armor is just health.
[124:54.10]And you pick up those little red boxes to permanently increase it.
[124:57.52]That's the only way.
[125:00.56]Oh, wait, yeah, I had the grape.
[125:03.68]Is that just, uh, transportation?
[125:08.69]What did you say about grapes?
[125:10.63]I have the grape.
[125:11.87]What's the grape?
[125:13.67]Oh, no, it has a howitzer on it.
[125:17.35]And it carries four people.
[125:19.97]Do you have to be a ranger to get in?
[125:22.33]Yeah.
[125:23.37]I think so.
[125:25.49]I think so.
[125:27.38]Anyway, it's just a target.
[125:29.38]The heal's only for me.
[125:31.98]Listen, I'm on a new character class, and there's a gun called Anti-Aircraft Impulse that I guess I'm going to try.
[125:40.24]You eating, like, gum in your mic?
[125:43.68]Like, unwrapping it in your mic?
[125:46.16]Yeah, I'm unwrapping it inside the mic.
[125:49.00]Are you marked as a... Oh, God, we have this on hard.
[125:52.24]Why did you do this to us?
[125:54.12]It was an accident.
[125:55.00]Also, I didn't even select the mission.
[125:56.32]Wait, did I?
[125:59.64]Oh, non-rangers can be passengers in the great pool.
[126:03.85]I'll make a protein bar.
[126:05.51]I'm eating these little snack replacement bars.
[126:11.21]Alright, what if the prince was a... It's the wrong mission anyway.
[126:14.29]I have to change it.
[126:16.06]I don't have the chip for this.
[126:19.06]Oh, I thought we were doing the air control mission.
[126:23.48]We are.
[126:23.80]I just... I'm a bad host.
[126:26.34]And all complaints directed at me.
[126:28.95]Look at all those items we got.
[126:32.73]Get on it, man.
[126:33.39]Come on.
[126:36.21]Last one ready.
[126:38.58]Hey, get on it.
[126:39.75]It'd be great if, like, it telling me that Jerma has selected an item isn't covering up the options I'm trying to select.
[126:50.99]What?
[126:51.29]I can't ready because apparently I'm not allowed to pick up weapons.
[126:53.60]Oh, no, I can't use this.
[126:54.88]I can't use these two things.
[126:56.36]Shit.
[126:57.30]It's the same problem as last time.
[126:59.70]Yeah.
[127:00.92]You could use, oh yeah, you could use them on the other mission because that was hard.
[127:04.34]Mm-hmm.
[127:04.80]Oh, like you can, yeah, I have to lower my level.
[127:06.86]Looks like up to level three is all you can use.
[127:13.01]Hmm.
[127:15.95]Okay.
[127:17.57]Still ready.
[127:18.19]I'm gonna try Plasma Fall.
[127:20.21]Fuck it, you know what I mean?
[127:22.16]Um, how about you destroy your blaster?
[127:24.86]Who cares?
[127:27.21]It's really chewy.
[127:30.00]Chewy.
[127:32.90]I hope that Plasma Fall is good at shooting airborne dart.
[127:37.94]I hope it is too.
[127:39.60]I don't think it is.
[127:41.24]I remember that weapon.
[127:42.80]It's really chewy though.
[127:44.34]That's one good thing.
[127:46.25]Can you open another into your microphone?
[127:48.71]God.
[127:49.71]Are you reading?
[127:52.55]I saw all of that by the way.
[127:54.17]I'm testing the new weapon.
[127:55.35]I have never used it.
[127:58.31]I saw 100%.
[127:59.07]Hey, Jeremiah, do you need any- Jeremiah, come back, do you need any Gatorade?
[128:03.38]Ah!
[128:04.94]Jeremiah, do you need Gatorade?
[128:06.34]No, no, we just won the championship!
[128:08.58]No, what's happening?
[128:09.30]Don't dump it on me.
[128:11.10]Oh!
[128:11.42]What?
[128:12.08]Good joke.
[128:16.16]This thing's- what the fuck?
[128:19.03]Look at the range on this thing.
[128:21.39]Wow.
[128:22.19]Plasma fall is like you fly up into the air and mortar down on people.
[128:26.13]Who made that?
[128:33.51]I thought this thing would be doing more damage.
[128:35.86]So what does this thing do?
[128:38.36]Got a little blinky red boy.
[128:44.36]Yeah, this thing sucks.
[128:45.84]God, we're in bad.
[128:48.94]How long does this stay put?
[128:51.94]Alright, yeah, that thing's not good.
[128:53.00]Oh.
[128:54.18]Does it only shoot one enemy?
[128:55.40]Hold it.
[128:56.15]I am holding it.
[128:57.89]That's as far as it goes.
[128:59.15]That's a single aircraft claymore.
[129:04.59]Yeah, this is not good.
[129:05.90]I can kill nine aircraft.
[129:08.18]Plasma Destroyer is not bad.
[129:09.76]It's got good range and it doesn't take my jetpack.
[129:20.04]Yeah, so I have nine of these.
[129:21.90]Why wouldn't I bring one of the homing things that I have?
[129:23.66]Yeah, I want to try the new weapon.
[129:26.06]Worth a try.
[129:27.10]I had a homing thing as well, but it's only single shot.
[129:29.54]This thing sucks.
[129:31.69]This thing's good.
[129:33.43]This thing sucks.
[129:36.08]Oh fuck, I forgot, it's using my- my- woah, that's- that's a surprise.
[129:41.01]That's a surprise egg.
[129:44.71]It's using- it's- what?
[129:48.56]Uh, no one will ever know.
[129:54.32]Alright, I understand.
[129:55.18]Yeah, I'm like useless right now.
[130:00.59]Okay.
[130:01.01]This does have decent range.
[130:10.32]Oh, you can reload these.
[130:11.50]I'm dead.
[130:13.30]There's a giant health pack next to me though.
[130:19.95]There's a large... We all spread out.
[130:22.55]Coming.
[130:25.26]Don't pick up the health before you... No, I have to, because otherwise I'd be at, like, two health.
[130:29.06]Isn't it group heal?
[130:30.72]Oh, whoops.
[130:31.18]I... No.
[130:32.02]I tried to switch.
[130:32.74]No group heal.
[130:34.64]The yellow reduces damage you take.
[130:37.27]Oh, well.
[130:41.87]I'm just going to only use these impulse grenades from now on.
[130:44.75]We're in position.
[130:50.54]I can't even just, I can't do anything.
[130:52.43]This gun is super bad.
[130:54.67]Just Jerma's character screaming in pain.
[130:59.93]It was supposed to be better.
[131:02.03]It was a higher level.
[131:05.86]Is my thing actually doing anything?
[131:11.58]I'm just gonna go get weapons.
[131:18.21]I don't think we got this one in the bag.
[131:19.99]I mean, there's so many people here.
[131:23.11]I get to summon the... Stop reloading.
[131:26.57]They disappear.
[131:27.79]Okay.
[131:29.05]I feel ya.
[131:34.12]Well, oh good.
[131:37.16]The other weapon I have is really not great at all.
[131:40.85]There you go.
[131:42.13]I didn't reload.
[131:42.93]Now I'm fully protected against all UFOs right here.
[131:45.93]Oh, come on, destroyer.
[131:47.43]Somehow this is working.
[132:01.43]Well, this defense thing seems really good.
[132:03.35]We're barely taking any damage here.
[132:04.81]We have double defense because I'm putting down nine separate anti-air, like, shotguns.
[132:09.43]That's the red flashes.
[132:10.58]Alright, here comes more.
[132:12.50]Alright, time to reload.
[132:23.00]Oh.
[132:23.50]Humans?
[132:25.18]Any more?
[132:25.54]If they were attacking any other mammal, we would not be so concerned.
[132:30.80]Basically.
[132:32.84]Oh, I love that series.
[132:35.17]What series?
[132:35.91]Any other mammal?
[132:37.21]No, he's talking about your old Basically series.
[132:40.83]Oh, so he's being a sarcastic cunt.
[132:43.41]Whoa!
[132:45.23]Whoa, my god!
[132:47.17]What the fuck?
[132:48.21]To reload, I was just in shock.
[132:55.42]Alright, here we go.
[132:58.90]Uh, are you in the mech?
[133:00.31]yeah cool oh my god anything but it's dealing a lot of damage also I'm almost dead easy easy there what people say that in England like it's the word cereal you're fine demonetized yeah this thing shreds that guy's already dead
[133:34.77]I was gonna pick up that weapon crate, but I guess I'll just look up.
[133:37.37]We have to move from here.
[133:38.43]And die.
[133:38.87]We gotta move from here.
[133:40.67]They're destroying everything here.
[133:41.65]It's okay, I have a dodge roll.
[133:45.20]It's iframe.
[133:46.50]Get me in that little zone.
[133:57.73]It's still... This is actually working.
[134:00.95]I really can't believe you said that on stream, Star.
[134:03.29]What?
[134:03.65]Like you said cereal on stream.
[134:05.85]Why are you going to be so uptight?
[134:12.19]You can't say cereal.
[134:15.33]Oh, that green thing is shooting at us.
[134:18.93]What happened to me?
[134:20.21]Why did that happen to me?
[134:21.58]That shot a super giant green laser.
[134:31.36]I love that line.
[134:31.96]Oh, I got to get to this heal.
[134:33.90]There's a heal station down still.
[134:36.16]Where is it?
[134:37.97]In the green?
[134:39.19]Where I am.
[134:39.91]Oh, no, it's gone.
[134:40.91]It disappeared right as I got to it.
[134:42.27]Shoot.
[134:42.83]I'm almost reloaded in my guard post, though, which is the defense.
[134:47.51]This is a pretty good little weapon here for this mission.
[134:49.71]Oh, my God.
[134:50.39]Okay, here comes a shitload.
[134:58.44]Where are we off to?
[135:03.25]I don't think they had anti-air beacons before.
[135:08.21]I gotta get this health.
[135:08.85]Let me try and drop something here.
[135:21.68]So much going on.
[135:24.46]This actually might work.
[135:34.25]Found the heal.
[135:43.27]The gigantic ship.
[135:45.99]God damn it.
[135:47.13]What happened?
[135:47.69]They're all relatively quite large.
[136:01.96]Oh my goodness.
[136:04.38]This is what it feels like to play Far Cry 5.
[136:06.14]This is what it feels like to chew straw gum.
[136:12.24]Sponsored.
[136:16.80]Alright, I'm gonna start collecting.
[136:22.20]Uh-oh.
[136:22.88]Adio.
[136:23.68]Back.
[136:25.08]Is it really gonna take this many shots to kill you?
[136:26.87]What the heck was that?
[136:33.08]There's no crates really anywhere.
[136:34.86]I'm getting it.
[136:35.38]Fly over me, I dare you.
[136:43.71]Okay.
[136:44.83]Seriously, this thing has a machine gun that, like, one-shots these.
[136:55.81]What is that yellow force field?
[136:58.02]uh defense up like our just our health up like she like we resist damage better yeah yeah there's this damage quite a bit which is I think a big reason why we weren't dying let's see a couple over here a great number of drones were dispatched on the gigantic ship did we beat it I don't know it seems kind of quiet seems very quiet
[137:27.30]You see any crates?
[137:29.07]I don't see any.
[137:36.25]There's two down here.
[137:37.97]Alright, we're gonna play laser tag.
[137:41.49]Uh, there's still something coming this way.
[137:42.59]Is that two stray ships over there?
[137:46.42]I just thought you might want a disco party.
[137:48.82]What is over here?
[137:49.84]Since you've got these big red flares coming out of your gun.
[137:52.64]These things are stuck in the building.
[137:57.93]You're playing laser tag.
[137:58.86]I would have so many points right now.
[138:01.36]Speaking of stuck in a building.
[138:04.86]You're not allowed to look at me.
[138:06.22]He's desperately trying to get over here.
[138:08.86]Look, I'm going to protect you.
[138:09.70]I'm going to make sure not a single alien ship gets even closer to you.
[138:14.75]I should reload my stuff just in case we're not done.
[138:16.99]I think we're good.
[138:20.93]There you go.
[138:21.37]Stand in that circle and you'll be safe forever.
[138:23.98]Hey, we finally beat that mission.
[138:25.48]What do you know?
[138:33.67]Alright.
[138:35.65]I got the suppress gun.
[138:40.32]Oh, dude.
[138:40.68]You try out this new silent gun?
[138:42.62]Suppress gun.
[138:43.70]We finally beat it.
[138:46.32]What difficulty was that on?
[138:47.90]That was... That was normal.
[138:49.34]That was the normal that we couldn't beat before.
[138:52.70]Closed laser turbo core.
[138:53.90]Grit shot up.
[138:54.72]Okay.
[138:56.21]What did it do though?
[138:58.29]This Mag Blaster.
[139:00.77]So, every time you get a level up, it increases the star counter, right?
[139:03.93]Yeah.
[139:05.59]Ooh, this got much better.
[139:06.87]Because it doesn't go level up just because you got an up.
[139:10.13]No, it's just, I think it's a randomized chance to have, like, a better roll, maybe, depending on what level it is.
[139:17.02]Oh, I think if you just look and don't immediately press X on every notification, it tells you exactly what it did.
[139:23.20]Yeah, it shows you what, like, what it increased to.
[139:26.74]But I just have to X fast because I don't have time to look.
[139:30.01]Oh, you're mashing X. Yeah, because I'm the last person to, like, ready up, so I gotta go fast.
[139:36.89]Well, don't listen to him.
[139:37.75]He's a fucking psycho.
[139:39.61]I'm not saying anything.
[139:40.89]All I'm saying is that you guys better watch out for my suppress gun.
[139:44.96]I'm going to try this.
[139:46.16]I'm going to suppress your audio.
[139:49.41]Well, does it say what the next mission is?
[139:52.43]Heading into the city, I think it's more air things.
[139:58.75]We need to... So I'm going to use the same healing.
[140:08.83]The Quiet Threat.
[140:10.59]Weapon level up to level 3.
[140:11.81]Armor limit 320 or less.
[140:14.66]The plan was to head to the city through the industrial area, but look at those flying saucers in the sky.
[140:20.30]We need to be careful.
[140:21.54]Alright, so is this like a primary air?
[140:23.33]Should I keep my anti-air?
[140:25.29]Yeah.
[140:26.89]Sounds like it's possible.
[140:27.95]I'm going to use my suppress gun on them.
[140:34.83]I mean, you have said that four times now.
[140:37.04]I think everyone heard you.
[140:37.76]Well, it's because the mission name is the Quiet Threat.
[140:42.62]I kind of want to try a missile launcher.
[140:44.59]they're fun oh actually I have a my class has an item that puts like homing beacons on things so that your rocket launchers will home at them I was told not to pick the air tortoise quite a sequel but the reload is two seconds you're gonna listen to your chat oh the lock on time you're gonna let them decide what you do
[141:12.43]Uh, do you have a problem with that?
[141:15.61]Just use the suppress gun.
[141:18.23]Alright, I'm just gonna need access to your PlayStation account.
[141:22.37]See, there we go, so that's what they changed.
[141:24.10]Item collection range is higher on the Ranger.
[141:26.86]Makes sense, it is the Ranger.
[141:28.42]Here we go, wowie.
[141:30.80]I like your, uh, net gun from the... How far does this go?
[141:35.24]Yeah, this gun isn't gonna do anything.
[141:41.65]Look how far those bullets are spread apart.
[141:45.75]I don't like the dentist gun very much.
[141:48.85]Hey, come down here.
[141:50.27]I knew this was going to be bad.
[141:51.95]This thing sucks.
[141:52.77]I think the UFOs are faster than my rockets.
[141:53.93]Just got to wait for them to come down here.
[141:57.05]And then boom.
[141:58.11]Get suppressed.
[142:07.49]and not even destroyed.
[142:09.11]Get, like, slightly... Inconvenienced.
[142:12.57]We may have not done the necessary research.
[142:15.75]Should I restart, like, retreat?
[142:18.43]Hold on, let me just see if I can even kill one flying saucer.
[142:21.87]I broke the bridge.
[142:22.96]That was me.
[142:23.62]I got one.
[142:25.44]I can't do anything.
[142:27.58]I'm not here.
[142:30.20]Don't fight them all at once.
[142:37.51]I guess that's what they want us to do.
[142:38.89]Actually, this thing's not that bad.
[142:48.60]I don't hate this anymore.
[142:49.46]I can't, like, lock on to anything because nothing is... Dude, let's just run forward into the city.
[142:56.46]They say one by one.
[142:57.36]Let's go forward and I'll drop down the beacons.
[143:00.96]Why would you go against our intelligence?
[143:02.16]I will drop down my stuff.
[143:03.96]Don't listen to chat.
[143:04.74]Don't listen to the game either.
[143:07.35]So at full power, I get it.
[143:08.89]I figured out the speed run tactics here.
[143:13.95]I understand.
[143:16.09]At full power, this thing does a lot more damage.
[143:18.44]I was just doing it sideways.
[143:19.60]Did you guys just say George?
[143:20.50]George!
[143:20.76]Okay, let's take a stand here.
[143:23.46]Alright.
[143:37.20]Seems good.
[143:40.66]And I'll use my suppress gun.
[143:47.45]Okay, I've got anti-air claymores surrounding us.
[143:53.09]I have this gun where if they come into melee range of me, I push them away and then they keep doing it.
[143:58.44]It's a wind gun?
[144:00.50]I actually like this a lot.
[144:02.32]This is perfect for this Michonne.
[144:05.44]Michonne?
[144:05.84]Mm-hmm.
[144:07.98]Fucking dead?
[144:09.44]Wait, what?
[144:09.88]Just come down here and... I don't even need to go in the air.
[144:13.92]After some detailed analysis, we have figured out the conditions in which the alert mode... Yeah, we're playing... I wish I had a mouse for this.
[144:21.71]Man versus machine right now.
[144:24.31]Once I get my neck, we'll be good.
[144:26.33]I'll just do something.
[144:28.73]You guys can kill the UFOs faster than my rockets can get there.
[144:33.73]Nearby drones will turn into combat mode.
[144:36.87]Yeah, why do you literally have, like, the beam weapon that looks probably the best for this mission?
[144:41.15]I know, it just is.
[144:43.61]I made the right decision somehow, and I was just trying it out.
[144:46.63]Watch out, they're gliding in.
[144:47.47]Well, I suppressed it.
[144:51.15]Have any of my rockets hit anything?
[144:52.59]No.
[144:53.67]They, like, don't hurt us at all.
[144:56.45]I think we found the broken, overpowered weapon, which is your thing here.
[145:05.91]I just gotta kill a few more and then I can be useful.
[145:12.03]It's fun just hovering around, just dentisting people.
[145:16.65]Look at that guy over there.
[145:17.49]Looks like he belongs there, okay.
[145:19.95]How far can that laser even shoot?
[145:21.72]Uh, across like the whole game.
[145:23.42]Oh.
[145:25.50]But at 50% ammo, it's kind of worth it.
[145:31.49]Well, I'm just the guy that makes sure nobody actually gets close because I can't really do anything else.
[145:36.02]I think I have to get out.
[145:38.72]You're doing a pretty good job of just doing that.
[145:40.76]There's a couple of strays over here.
[145:46.00]Why would I even put on the other weapon?
[145:51.93]So the blue ones are just background?
[145:53.57]Yeah, they fly in.
[145:58.25]In addition, our enemy has been launching indiscriminate attacks on our cities.
[146:02.67]Well, when my rocket does hit, it's really good.
[146:04.56]As I am speaking, the casualties are increasing.
[146:07.60]Is this building going to go down anything?
[146:09.24]We have no choice but to fight.
[146:12.12]Suppress you.
[146:13.50]You mean like the gas refinery next to us?
[146:16.40]Yeah, that thing's gonna blow, right?
[146:17.86]It has to.
[146:18.51]Alright, now I'm gonna go collect.
[146:19.45]I'm gonna be useful here.
[146:21.49]I haven't been collecting anything.
[146:25.57]They're all scattered around so far, though, it's hard to collect anything.
[146:29.75]Gotta get, like, a better view.
[146:30.75]Alright, what do we got?
[146:34.70]Anything?
[146:37.36]Okay, now I know to jump up and away.
[146:39.48]Not really.
[146:43.07]Are we, like, done?
[146:43.99]Did I get my mech and then the mission was over?
[146:46.05]Uh, I don't really see any UFOs in the sky anymore, so... Possibly.
[146:51.32]Unless there's a phase two.
[146:57.50]Can I try the mech next time?
[146:59.06]No.
[146:59.82]That is not my mech.
[147:02.32]No.
[147:02.62]Though I was told that it could be if I chose this class.
[147:08.27]Well, like, you actually have guns that do things.
[147:11.62]Why does your mech have such a big dick?
[147:15.06]What?
[147:16.52]Your mech has, like, a gigantic dick.
[147:19.24]Oh, it's like Zone of the Enders, where you're in the cockpit.
[147:22.98]You're, like, physically in the cockpit, you know?
[147:27.16]I'm out of here.
[147:28.32]Like, seriously, it's even got, like, a discoloration on...
[147:32.91]What do you mean?
[147:33.85]Do you have a discolored dick?
[147:36.34]What are you talking about?
[147:37.16]He's got a silver, like, dick head.
[147:39.04]Yeah, but why is that... What do you mean?
[147:41.06]That adds to the realism.
[147:42.46]What are you talking about?
[147:45.14]Oh, I got the Dexter automatic shot.
[147:46.81]This is the D in EDF.
[147:48.31]I gotta get out of here.
[147:48.97]I gotta go.
[147:50.19]Dude, didn't you ever play Zone of the Unders?
[147:52.73]I did play Zone of the Unders, yeah.
[147:54.61]He's one of the enders.
[147:55.35]Like, you have a giant flying mech with a head, but the guy, the pilot, is in a see-through cockpit.
[148:01.01]Oh, well, when I played, I was, like, 13, so I didn't really put two and two together.
[148:04.57]Well, now you know.
[148:08.23]Is this flying again?
[148:10.67]Um... It doesn't say.
[148:14.58]We're safe here.
[148:15.18]Trust me.
[148:15.52]It says monsters attack mission seven, so I'd assume monsters are attacking.
[148:20.06]Time to not do air stuff, then.
[148:23.10]Time to never use the suppress gun ever again.
[148:25.61]Let me try this thing.
[148:32.97]Every time Star comes around, we just... The conversations... They just go off the rails.
[148:39.98]I think you just don't like me anymore.
[148:42.70]Like you're done with me.
[148:44.48]Cast me aside.
[148:45.36]He's too vulgar.
[148:48.42]We only make jokes about being short here.
[148:50.64]Wait, who's too vulgar?
[148:52.50]Me.
[148:53.26]I didn't say any of these things.
[148:58.32]I love the completion rate.
[148:59.46]0.7%.
[148:59.48]0.59% completion rate.
[149:01.13]How do you have a 0.72% completion rate?
[149:03.11]Oh, he played offline.
[149:03.83]No, no, no, you.
[149:04.09]Me?
[149:04.15]You have almost a 1% completion rate.
[149:05.25]Probably how many items I found.
[149:17.73]Yeah, because he found items on two classes, so maybe... Oh.
[149:22.06]Two for one.
[149:23.44]Completed it.
[149:24.24]Not even 1%.
[149:24.58]Okay, so... I'm good to go.
[149:31.24]Did you ever deny it?
[149:32.48]I did deny it.
[149:33.30]That's not true.
[149:34.50]Do you guys want me to be like a... Is there any reason I should take a heal gun?
[149:41.47]Not yet.
[149:42.95]Once we start having trouble again.
[149:48.96]It's based on mission completion with different classes.
[149:51.00]Okay.
[149:51.80]So that makes sense.
[149:57.89]You guys ready?
[149:59.63]I'm ready.
[150:00.05]No.
[150:01.61]Hold on.
[150:03.33]Come on.
[150:03.59]You're the expert.
[150:04.23]You have more completion than both of us.
[150:06.45]I can't pick my level 5 gun.
[150:15.10]Throw up.
[150:15.52]Puke.
[150:15.78]Do it.
[150:16.16]Puke.
[150:17.73]Oh my god, everything just goes off the rails when you start hearing someone about to throw up.
[150:22.56]Wow, talk about vulgar.
[150:26.12]We're just not compatible anymore.
[150:31.12]This thing can charge, but how much does it use?
[150:34.78]Nice, okay, I get it.
[150:36.69]Let's get in there.
[150:39.91]Destroy the monsters!
[150:42.89]Oh, it's the spiders!
[150:45.27]It is the spiders.
[150:53.84]Oh, this thing is fucking awesome.
[150:59.92]I'm gonna drop a post here.
[151:04.18]These things are always scary.
[151:07.98]Yeah, this game is too scary.
[151:13.66]Beware of the thread!
[151:16.88]Yeah, the thread comes out and goes.
[151:20.00]It gets you.
[151:25.93]disgusting really mute are your anti-air guns hitting them when they jump sorry these are like the same as anti-air guns except I pointed them down they're effectively the same weapon but they're different loadouts so this is like my ground claymore
[151:55.68]I don't even need guns.
[151:56.66]You want to just die?
[151:58.60]I'm stuck.
[152:02.46]To be honest, this is really effective.
[152:10.57]James is fun to watch.
[152:12.25]I'm not numb to it yet because it's my first one since like the PlayStation 2.
[152:17.43]But I love how nonchalant you guys are about like, oh yeah, this is just default.
[152:23.82]Yeah, these are spider ones.
[152:26.12]Oh, man.
[152:26.68]Oh, yeah, the spiders.
[152:27.78]I remember them.
[152:28.24]They're fun.
[152:28.60]No, this is nothing.
[152:30.82]Just wait till the game goes off the rails.
[152:34.65]Yeah, especially when you get the Megazord.
[152:37.03]This is off the rails for me.
[152:38.29]They gotta up the ante every single time.
[152:40.03]No, no, no.
[152:40.91]You got the bumpers on in the bowling alley, man.
[152:46.52]Well, my point is, it's fun.
[152:48.96]That is a very good point.
[152:50.90]I would agree.
[152:51.32]Can you not shoot me, please?
[152:57.16]I mean, I could, but where's the fun in that?
[152:59.34]I want to have fun.
[153:00.33]Watch it.
[153:00.77]Here it comes.
[153:01.37]It's going to open up.
[153:01.99]It's going to be saucers.
[153:02.83]Is it crashing?
[153:05.27]I don't know.
[153:06.85]It's going in a really weird direction.
[153:13.92]Where is it going?
[153:15.86]Okay, so the vehicles I get to pilot, are they all from the support guy, or are there going to be, like, vehicles in the game that this guy can pilot?
[153:26.22]I don't know if you have some of the ones that you can use.
[153:29.48]Here it comes.
[153:29.84]It's opening something.
[153:35.22]You can use my mech if you want right now.
[153:37.80]I'm kind of having fun with my... my other weapon.
[153:42.56]I'm melting your whole face off.
[153:44.02]What the hell?
[153:46.02]We're supposed to be going somewhere?
[153:47.02]I think we have to wait for this.
[153:50.66]Can I like ride on it with you?
[153:51.86]That'd be pretty cool.
[153:54.34]What happens if you step on me?
[153:56.59]It's just in the air, isn't it?
[153:58.09]I think I can.
[153:59.11]Try jumping.
[153:59.85]Try pressing.
[154:00.53]Here it comes.
[154:01.47]Here they come.
[154:03.09]Oh, I thought that was going to arc.
[154:08.63]Defeat all monsters.
[154:09.77]Defeat all monsters.
[154:11.39]But at least you should wipe out the monsters.
[154:13.92]So do you get to keep like an armor buff on your leg?
[154:19.04]Yeah.
[154:20.22]It's on top of the mech.
[154:25.44]So I place it on the mech, and it gives me the defense.
[154:29.28]What?
[154:29.54]It went through them.
[154:30.18]Can I put, like, anti-ground on your feet?
[154:34.18]If you jump up on my hind leg, you can probably put them on there.
[154:40.29]Oh, boy.
[154:40.67]Bad.
[154:40.85]I got to reload.
[154:43.17]I'm just going to go in and fly through with, like, a full balance here.
[154:47.99]Let's do it.
[154:49.92]Hold on, I'm dropping.
[154:50.94]I'm dropping.
[154:53.10]Oh, you can't dash when you're using that fucker, okay?
[154:57.12]That makes sense, if I'm honest.
[154:58.76]I think I got one of them on.
[155:03.01]I have like my own spider webs and all these EDF guys that are following us.
[155:09.09]Yeah, I got another one.
[155:11.59]There we go.
[155:12.40]Yeah, you're very well defended from a close range right now.
[155:19.08]I don't know what that thing's target is at.
[155:21.24]Those, like, red beams will auto-kill anything that gets close.
[155:26.09]Oh!
[155:26.93]Alright, I gotta collect.
[155:33.55]Lots of weapon crates.
[155:36.37]You gonna do something about it?
[155:38.64]I'm getting them.
[155:40.48]I am collecting them.
[155:42.04]As best as I can.
[155:43.75]We were ambushed by the enemy and suffered great loss.
[155:47.69]The ravages of war have spread all over the world and are even getting more serious.
[155:54.57]Mm-hmm.
[155:55.73]I don't think they used to, like, squirt purple goo everywhere.
[156:01.07]I was about to ask if it was, like, bad to stand in or if there's any acid damage or anything.
[156:05.64]It probably is.
[156:06.44]I would not stand in anything that is on the ground.
[156:09.86]It's fine.
[156:10.78]God, it's fine.
[156:11.88]Did we just win?
[156:15.69]Ah.
[156:15.77]Why was that mission significantly easier?
[156:20.31]The flying levels always are a pain in the butt.
[156:24.35]Until you get shit like you had the anti-air stuff.
[156:26.77]I think I got all the boxes over here, too.
[156:30.93]I think it's a bit easier.
[156:33.59]Also, uh, Jermu's flying class has, like, homing lasers.
[156:38.77]That'd make it a bit easier.
[156:41.37]Yeah.
[156:41.61]I got the power assist gun.
[156:44.03]Long Range Bolt Shooter.
[156:45.77]3+.
[156:47.17]Bolt II.
[156:49.50]Let me try that one.
[156:53.48]Short range.
[156:54.22]More range.
[156:54.80]Not that much, though.
[156:57.46]I keep getting upgrades for this, but... That's the... the dentist beam.
[157:06.14]Lightning Bow.
[157:06.86]Less energy cost.
[157:07.82]Pretty good.
[157:10.75]More range on the bolt gun and faster shot speed.
[157:14.67]This is new.
[157:17.39]I don't know that we need guard posts anymore actually, I'll try this.
[157:39.67]Okay, let's go.
[157:40.39]Let's go try it.
[157:42.38]I'm ready.
[157:46.60]That thing is good, but... Oh, yeah.
[157:48.54]Did you play Smash?
[157:49.86]You like Smash.
[157:51.08]I did play a little bit of Smash.
[157:52.84]Not on stream, though.
[157:53.60]Oh, so you're already over it?
[157:58.35]No, the online was pretty terrible.
[158:03.42]It just, you'd queue up.
[158:05.90]I mean, the game is really fun for Smash.
[158:09.58]It's like, hey, queue up 1v1.
[158:10.82]Let's do some 1v1s.
[158:11.80]And it's like, you want to do four player?
[158:14.21]What type of enemy types for this particular mission?
[158:17.39]It says monsters, so maybe more spiders.
[158:23.37]I'm going to put this back on.
[158:24.33]This thing is really good.
[158:26.97]Capacity nine.
[158:31.23]Nine target lock on.
[158:33.77]I feel like I'm the only one.
[158:34.61]That sounds fun.
[158:36.19]It just feels like the same thing.
[158:39.05]Moo means moo.
[158:39.89]What the fuck are you doing?
[158:40.71]It's a new Smash game, but it just looks... It's just the same game.
[158:49.62]I probably don't know enough.
[158:51.66]Did your account get hacked?
[158:54.98]What?
[158:55.80]No, I'm talking to one of my mods.
[159:00.62]Oh.
[159:10.59]That's how he is!
[159:18.89]Jesus Christ.
[159:24.36]Alright, let's see how this thing is.
[159:25.64]I'm so ready for this.
[159:26.42]Uh-oh, pylons.
[159:27.64]Pylons?
[159:29.62]Ooh.
[159:31.18]Look at this thing.
[159:34.18]How far does it go, I wonder?
[159:35.40]How much energy does it take?
[159:37.09]A lot.
[159:37.69]And it's very slow to reload.
[159:39.05]Oh, hey, I got that.
[159:40.53]Wait, wait, wait.
[159:41.35]Stand still, Etalyx.
[159:42.43]Stand still.
[159:45.07]That gives you extra damage.
[159:46.11]You're good.
[159:46.43]Oh, thank you.
[159:47.99]Very nice.
[159:50.73]I think I should do it.
[159:51.47]These are fun weapons.
[159:52.55]Whoops, I accidentally targeted some civilians.
[159:55.69]But you know what they say about civilians.
[159:57.19]This is really fast reload.
[159:58.29]But they're all missing.
[160:05.64]Where did you come from?
[160:06.46]Oh, do you want damage bonus, Jeremiah?
[160:11.54]Ah, that sounds like fun.
[160:12.82]Come to me.
[160:14.78]Stand still.
[160:15.94]I'm standing still.
[160:16.64]Stand still.
[160:17.24]I don't even have to aim with this gun.
[160:18.86]There you go.
[160:22.28]Just power the dentist.
[160:26.48]I just let it do all the work.
[160:27.88]I wonder how much damage it's actually doing.
[160:36.57]Can these people shut up?
[160:39.25]If they say they don't want to die one more time, I'm killing them.
[160:44.11]Why are you so sadistic?
[160:48.13]Oh, the beam.
[160:48.45]Well, you were yelling at me earlier for spamming help me, and listen to them.
[160:56.36]Just barely had a range with that.
[160:58.06]I probably should have picked a weapon that was capable of doing damage to the big pylon.
[161:04.94]Ooh, I did good.
[161:08.36]Okay, time to collect.
[161:11.34]Hey, what do you say we collect?
[161:13.16]What do you say we pick up some weapon crates?
[161:15.78]Pick up some weapon crates.
[161:17.58]Watch out for the threat!
[161:19.10]I just blew that guy's teeth out of his head.
[161:31.89]My frames, my frames!
[161:33.19]Oh, with the power of PS4 Pro, I have 15 extra frames per second.
[161:38.62]Okay, mission's over.
[161:39.90]Oh, look at this!
[161:41.20]What is that supposed to be?
[161:42.58]Somebody will fucking get it.
[161:53.05]Standstill standstill standstill you fucking stand.
[161:55.85]I'm gonna shoot you out of here.
[161:57.65]What do you want?
[161:58.11]Hold on standstill Hey, you like attaching C4 to it and it explodes What the fuck are you doing?
[162:10.68]What the hell?
[162:11.44]Alright, go.
[162:13.12]What do you mean go?
[162:14.00]There's nothing here.
[162:14.90]Yeah, there's a pylon over here.
[162:16.86]Why are they attached to me?
[162:19.04]They're attached to me.
[162:19.94]Yeah, now you're even better at shooting enemies now.
[162:24.62]Oh my god.
[162:25.61]Why is this possible?
[162:28.73]You're like a glowing red light.
[162:30.51]You're in disco light.
[162:36.01]This shouldn't be possible.
[162:37.13]That's not disco.
[162:38.61]Different era.
[162:39.73]Come on.
[162:43.22]It's like a Dragon Ball Z Newgrounds animation that was powering up.
[162:46.66]Oh no, I've ran out of juice.
[162:48.86]This is distracting to me.
[162:55.62]Get these tools off of me.
[162:57.66]Why do I feel like this is easier than, like, the first mission?
[163:00.92]Yeah.
[163:01.18]Because we powered up, man.
[163:02.44]Maybe we should be playing on hard.
[163:03.60]Well, no, it's just, like, one pylon at a time.
[163:09.78]Uh-oh.
[163:10.30]I'm getting webbed.
[163:11.56]So am I. Uh, I'm sorry, Etalyx.
[163:14.42]Hi.
[163:14.90]There's something on me.
[163:17.12]I need to go collect.
[163:19.86]These things take a lot of energy, and I'm kind of wasting my energy here.
[163:22.67]I really need to conserve my energy.
[163:28.93]You're putting things on me!
[163:31.15]There's a weapon crate right here.
[163:33.07]Oh, that will never stop being entertaining to me.
[163:34.95]Oh, here comes another.
[163:37.07]Oh god, that's so far away.
[163:40.75]I need health.
[163:44.73]Where are the bad guys?
[163:45.85]Down here.
[163:46.23]Look at your mini-map!
[163:48.45]Holy shit.
[163:50.58]Well, you look like you're doing some stuff over there, don't you?
[163:54.52]Yes, I'm doing some stuff.
[163:56.54]Yes, I'm doing some stuff!
[164:02.26]Look, we're just trying really hard, okay?
[164:07.37]We don't have time for jokes.
[164:10.89]Yes, I'm doing some stuff.
[164:15.12]Shocking announcement from staff.
[164:17.04]Mr. Pilgrim.
[164:18.04]No, don't do that.
[164:18.86]You know what that makes me do?
[164:19.90]That makes me do the whole thing.
[164:22.52]Don't make me do that.
[164:23.22]Why did you have to say that?
[164:35.53]Oh, journalists.
[164:39.71]Don't make me do the whole thing.
[164:42.39]Don't you know I'm a fucking toon from Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
[164:45.52]You start playing like a song and I'm gonna start doing it.
[164:49.68]And I'm gonna burst through the fucking your wall and I'm gonna scream it.
[164:53.40]It is I.
[165:01.10]Gotcha.
[165:03.24]He did got me.
[165:03.98]That was a nice shot, Ana.
[165:06.80]Thanks.
[165:09.10]There's a weapon crate right next to you, Talos.
[165:11.62]There, Jerma got it.
[165:12.76]He's really good.
[165:14.17]He can fly, so... They got more... More of those things that we need to get.
[165:21.19]Okay, I'm really slow, but I'm getting there.
[165:27.23]I'm just gonna sit on the building and just aim and just hold the button down and I'll just be- I'm just gonna sit on the couch.
[165:34.22]Okay.
[165:35.16]That's gonna- tell me how that works for you.
[165:38.08]Cuz in this room, I wanna sit on the couch too.
[165:40.46]Play from down, like on our couch.
[165:44.34]Yeah, we got a couch!
[165:45.72]You got a problem?
[165:46.48]I'm coming.
[165:47.74]I'm coming.
[165:51.92]I'm coming.
[165:53.12]There is a couch.
[165:57.00]I'm coming.
[166:00.32]I'm just taking out the pylon here.
[166:06.21]I'll get him shotgun.
[166:13.15]I feel like I should be... I'm not having fun doing this though.
[166:16.11]What I'm gonna do is necessary.
[166:17.89]Oh, did you just say what I think you said?
[166:19.79]What?
[166:19.97]Go fight the bugs.
[166:20.91]I can destroy the things real good.
[166:22.45]Well, I already did it.
[166:24.62]Very effectively.
[166:26.27]I'm really good at killing bugs now.
[166:33.49]I'm Mr. Crowd Control.
[166:38.08]Oh my god, that civilian's powered up.
[166:42.58]I can't see.
[166:43.32]I gotta go.
[166:44.42]No, don't charge that.
[166:45.44]I...
[166:54.58]These requests are being yelled too loud.
[166:57.77]We'll get to everyone.
[166:59.15]We hear requests, but now it's yelling.
[167:06.79]Oh.
[167:07.79]Oh, missed a crate over here.
[167:08.87]I'm sorry, guys.
[167:09.84]Don't get wet, basically.
[167:15.60]From the air.
[167:16.32]Metal Gear Online.
[167:25.60]Someone say Metal Gear.
[167:31.74]Metal Gear.
[167:32.78]I made a Gundam joke, you made a Metal Gear joke.
[167:34.66]We're basically on the same page.
[167:36.18]Metal Gear.
[167:37.10]It's not fair, your corny references.
[167:41.94]Hey, does anyone here think Metal Gear is a good game?
[167:43.96]Oh, wow, I think it's a good game now.
[167:45.30]I think it's cool.
[167:47.82]Sorry, we don't make Metal Gear games anymore.
[167:49.84]Yeah, they do.
[167:52.23]They made Metal Gear survive.
[167:55.73]I forgot that that game even came out.
[167:57.87]It did.
[167:58.39]I played it.
[168:00.35]I regret playing it.
[168:01.31]Wasn't it really bad?
[168:03.47]Oh, dude, you can jump.
[168:04.55]I knew you could jump.
[168:05.57]That's what I was telling you to do earlier.
[168:06.97]I don't know.
[168:10.86]And you can hover.
[168:11.82]Something in the water, guys.
[168:13.78]Don't talk to me.
[168:16.78]I don't know.
[168:20.38]Anything new?
[168:20.98]I don't drink water, so... Nope, nothing new for me.
[168:27.17]I did get a bunch of upgrades, though.
[168:33.87]Hmm.
[168:35.17]We will reach the city once we cross the mountain.
[168:38.37]We should be safe there.
[168:40.31]I know I'm asking a lot, but you have to keep going.
[168:44.43]You can rest when we get to the city.
[168:47.39]Ooh, bolt shooter.
[168:51.48]That got a lot better.
[168:55.40]That got a lot better.
[168:57.19]Look at the range increase.
[168:59.49]I'm looking at it, dude.
[169:00.39]It's... Try it again.
[169:04.13]Great shot, too.
[169:05.75]Damn.
[169:07.51]These are all good.
[169:09.40]I'm looking at it, and... Okay.
[169:14.48]I'm just gonna keep... I think I'm gonna keep it on.
[169:20.28]Because it just got way better.
[169:22.57]But I will put the Dragon Lance back on.
[169:27.23]Still, I need to get more of these.
[169:28.43]This is the only one I have.
[169:29.63]Oh man, I'm looking at it.
[169:33.39]Uh, this is called Escape.
[169:41.13]Okay, so... They're giving me too many toys.
[169:44.90]I got C4 now.
[169:45.50]Too many toys.
[169:48.24]You're going to have, like, probably two or three times the amount of toys that you have now.
[169:53.90]Well, who are we fighting this time?
[169:57.34]We don't know.
[169:58.00]We're in the mountains.
[169:59.10]In the mountains.
[170:00.28]Probably ants.
[170:02.07]Yeah, I would bet ants.
[170:03.31]It might have to start making us destroy ant holes, so maybe the C4 will be good.
[170:08.47]I could also do Grenade Launcher Tier 2.
[170:11.85]Oh, man.
[170:12.39]Tier 2.
[170:13.59]Ants don't live in mountains.
[170:15.60]I had to buy that one for DLC.
[170:17.56]Oh, dude.
[170:18.52]Mountains are just big anthills.
[170:20.74]So, um, did anybody buy, like, the anime waifu vehicle skin, by chance?
[170:27.33]Oh, the pillow?
[170:28.09]Oh, no.
[170:30.97]I didn't buy... I did not buy any of those things.
[170:33.94]I bought the base game.
[170:35.28]Not the $1.99... thing.
[170:41.71]Yeah, they have skins for all the vehicles that have.
[170:44.76]Look at how far that goes.
[170:48.14]What does this take?
[170:48.80]20, 30, 40.
[170:49.46]It takes a lot to recharge this.
[170:52.60]I can't use this that often.
[170:54.58]Dragonlance can be used.
[170:55.78]Holy shit, that's powerful.
[171:01.27]It is really cool to see the generational gaps in EDF games where the last one was a PS1 and this one's a PS2.
[171:10.16]Oh yeah, it's red ants.
[171:11.40]Watch out!
[171:13.04]Ants!
[171:13.78]Listen, there's so many more polygons now.
[171:19.26]Single target.
[171:20.56]May have been a mistake.
[171:24.83]It may have been a mistake.
[171:26.37]I shoot green smoke grenades.
[171:28.03]This range is bad.
[171:37.26]I took two of the same guns back.
[171:38.50]Surprisingly, my smoke grenades, or excuse me, my grenades rival your air calling.
[171:46.26]I'm using the wrong air calling.
[171:49.34]But yeah.
[171:50.10]Gotta get in close.
[171:55.85]I'm going to end up accidentally shooting one of you.
[171:58.95]I'm going to stay over here.
[172:02.85]You can get eaten by the ants.
[172:04.46]Does anyone want to shoot the ant that's eating me currently right next to Ster?
[172:09.20]I can have artillery shoot it.
[172:11.70]Don't worry.
[172:12.32]He spit me out.
[172:12.92]I'm fine.
[172:13.42]He even gave me a first aid kit.
[172:15.18]Oh, yeah.
[172:15.80]Yeah, the red ants can pick you up and grab you.
[172:18.32]Help me.
[172:18.70]Help me.
[172:19.20]Help me.
[172:22.51]You are saved.
[172:26.69]The range is terrible on this thing.
[172:34.84]Although it does kill in one hit, the red ants.
[172:36.32]Watch out for the tank.
[172:38.15]That guy vanished.
[172:41.83]Oh, I'm going to get overwhelmed.
[172:42.85]Get out of here.
[172:46.51]Dude, we're being ambushed.
[172:48.93]These things are beefy.
[172:53.55]They're grabbing me.
[172:55.20]I need help.
[172:55.86]He's grabbing me.
[172:56.58]I need help.
[172:56.96]He's grabbing me.
[172:57.38]I'm shooting him.
[172:58.38]He threw me really far.
[173:00.30]Where the hell are you?
[173:02.36]I took, like, no damage.
[173:03.42]It's okay.
[173:04.84]Dibs.
[173:05.75]Dibs on this.
[173:07.67]God, I have no ammo.
[173:12.45]Oh, you took my thing?
[173:16.29]Hey, finders keepers, move your sheet, lose your seat.
[173:19.12]Finders keepers, move your feet and lose your seat.
[173:24.09]I really need... I have a bad loadout for this.
[173:27.87]Sorry, guys.
[173:29.35]I'll take the elf for us.
[173:30.21]That's okay.
[173:30.95]Because there's so many ants, I have another mech.
[173:34.52]Really?
[173:35.34]Well, then we can both use mech.
[173:38.22]I just gotta get in there.
[173:40.88]If I get in there... But I don't want to get in there.
[173:44.25]My artillery's getting in there.
[173:45.57]If I had the plasma, yeah, that'd be amazing right now.
[173:48.29]Hold on, that's so long.
[173:49.53]I didn't even tell anybody.
[173:55.53]I could just fly over and drop missiles, but I didn't do that.
[174:03.15]Look at all the shit on the ground.
[174:05.27]Alright, I'm gonna go on collect duty now.
[174:06.49]Alright, 1v1 me.
[174:11.65]I don't think it's over, dude.
[174:13.63]Oh, you just killed me.
[174:14.37]You just murdered me.
[174:16.76]Me?
[174:17.48]He did.
[174:19.20]Who?
[174:20.14]I don't know.
[174:20.76]I went to 100% to zero.
[174:22.36]How did I get to zero percent health in one second?
[174:24.95]I dropped actually there like a year ago.
[174:28.46]Don't worry, we'll get to you eventually.
[174:30.50]Hey, if you're dead when the mission's over, you don't get any loot.
[174:35.32]He just ran into the artillery.
[174:37.03]Yeah, but I'm trying to... I gotta collect.
[174:39.67]Just wait till it's not the whole ground red.
[174:43.05]What are you, some lone shark?
[174:44.31]Is that hard?
[174:48.58]Is that too hard?
[174:49.52]Am I asking too much?
[174:53.02]You're about to get fucking booted from the lobby.
[174:57.23]I mean, what are we doing?
[174:58.57]Alright, that was... that was kind of rough.
[175:02.89]Because those... we're gonna get a lot more of those now.
[175:11.47]Bolt shooter increased again.
[175:13.25]No, I don't want to use this thing again.
[175:18.19]It's too long.
[175:18.67]It takes too long to shoot it.
[175:20.82]You can only shoot every .6 seconds.
[175:23.58]It takes almost a full... it's almost a full second to shoot this thing.
[175:29.72]Damage is alright, but it takes too long to reload.
[175:38.01]Ready.
[175:38.25]Do you even change your gear?
[175:41.59]Oh, wait.
[175:41.87]No.
[175:42.51]Large Flying Saucers.
[175:43.95]Yeah.
[175:44.19]Thank you.
[175:44.81]Is it Saucers?
[175:46.39]Yeah.
[175:46.57]Alright.
[175:47.21]I'm going to use the... Oh, wait.
[175:48.93]No.
[175:49.07]It's saying Large Flying Saucers and Drop Monsters in the city.
[175:53.43]Alright.
[175:53.69]I... It might be the big ones.
[175:55.06]Hold on.
[175:55.48]So...
[175:59.67]Unclear.
[176:01.03]Mission directive unclear.
[176:02.17]Reverser and proto-reverser.
[176:04.81]Hmm.
[176:09.27]I'm going to put the big cannon onto this.
[176:13.75]Do we think there's going to be more flying or ground?
[176:15.40]I have no idea.
[176:18.34]I think I'm going to go close range only.
[176:24.20]Shotgun and anti-air.
[176:29.38]Ooh, I have a dash.
[176:34.21]Wait a minute, I know what mission this is.
[176:38.07]Use the diffuser?
[176:38.75]Ooh, I'm ready.
[176:40.89]Yeah, I feel like I want it to level up.
[176:46.12]Oh, kiss me.
[176:46.76]Am I taking a break tomorrow?
[176:48.88]Yes, I am.
[176:51.31]What?
[176:51.55]You're going to take a break tomorrow?
[176:53.02]Oh, wow.
[176:54.08]Really?
[176:54.96]You told me we were going to play this multiple times.
[176:57.36]Someone said streaming.
[176:59.30]You're immediately going to bail out on me?
[177:01.74]Hold on.
[177:02.40]I've got to mute you guys for a second.
[177:06.32]Was it Salty Swamp?
[177:07.32]Yeah, I've talked about that a bunch of times.
[177:08.77]Yeah, it was like an old Flash animation that Blordow made.
[177:16.85]Yeah, we've talked about that before.
[177:19.33]Alright, I'm back.
[177:34.90]Thank you for explaining.
[177:36.56]You're very welcome.
[177:37.48]Alright, so let's talk about what strategy is here.
[177:41.32]Strategy is... Okay.
[177:45.37]Kill the ants.
[177:46.55]Kill the ants.
[177:47.11]And don't die.
[177:48.53]It said you could ignore the ships, but... The shotgun is awful for reload time.
[177:54.68]I gotta go do this.
[177:55.26]I gotta go in the air for this thing.
[177:57.13]Oh, dude, is this the air shotgun one?
[178:00.35]It is.
[178:01.07]I got air shotguns.
[178:02.61]No, I do.
[178:03.23]That's my class's thing.
[178:06.25]It could be everybody's thing.
[178:07.16]It doesn't have to be just your thing.
[178:09.44]It can only be one of ours.
[178:10.80]That's true.
[178:11.78]Hey, Jerma.
[178:12.48]Jerma, stand still.
[178:13.12]Jerma, stand still.
[178:13.72]Yeah.
[178:13.94]Thank you.
[178:14.24]Do you want to do more damage?
[178:18.56]Keep standing still.
[178:19.68]What?
[178:23.01]Now what?
[178:25.09]What are you coming over here with?
[178:26.59]You're coming over with a briefcase.
[178:27.91]What?
[178:28.29]Guys, this...
[178:34.62]As half of these didn't even get on me.
[178:36.62]There's only one guy to shoot.
[178:39.10]You're anti-air capable now, so you can fly completely uncontested through the sky.
[178:52.28]Trevor is a tool.
[178:54.48]What?
[178:56.56]What are you talking about?
[178:58.12]Get him out of here!
[178:59.78]I was making fun of your chat before, but I take it back.
[179:05.43]Is it the kid?
[179:06.99]There's like one... Yeah, imagine if we didn't have you and we had to climb this mountain to finish them off for the Den of Evil to be completed.
[179:18.51]I know, really, that would be a pain in the ass.
[179:24.75]Alright, dead.
[179:25.67]Den of evil.
[179:27.05]Hydrate.
[179:29.55]I don't know.
[179:30.13]I'm not going to.
[179:32.57]I've also got something for you.
[179:33.69]I'm gonna go inhale dust and make sure I get less hydrated.
[179:38.56]Is that it?
[179:42.24]Oh, that's not it.
[179:42.80]Okay.
[179:47.57]I am the tool master.
[179:50.09]Is that the whole mission?
[179:52.51]I... I don't know.
[179:54.18]They're acting like it's over.
[179:56.18]It does sound like a celebration is happening right now.
[180:00.14]I'm gonna go just get a bottle of salt and just chew on it.
[180:06.12]And then run around in a circle as hard as I can.
[180:07.98]They shouldn't take the salt for it, you know what I mean?
[180:12.00]Are we supposed to be shooting these?
[180:14.34]No, I can't shoot them.
[180:16.56]I don't... Oh.
[180:20.80]Come on, get there.
[180:21.54]Got it.
[180:21.98]At least he's only chewing the bottle.
[180:27.64]No, I'm good.
[180:33.57]I got the drinker.
[180:36.27]Alright, what's your favorite song?
[180:38.89]Let's see if I can do it with a beam.
[180:39.77]Never mind.
[180:40.15]Fun's over.
[180:44.66]We, like, went in the wrong direction because of the cutscene.
[180:48.22]Come on, guys.
[180:49.34]See you there.
[180:49.78]We're dropping bugs.
[180:52.00]See you guys there.
[180:52.88]I wanted to... Never mind.
[181:05.05]That was a very bad display of video gaming right there.
[181:08.44]This thing is so fucking weird.
[181:09.90]Don't, you gotta tell me you're gonna do that.
[181:11.72]Don't die to that.
[181:12.62]Hey, you have plenty of time.
[181:13.78]Oh, the shotgun's so powerful.
[181:15.26]It's so long to reload.
[181:18.64]That doesn't kill them.
[181:37.85]Alright, so what is EDF Endgame?
[181:41.23]You want to know about EDF Endgame?
[181:43.45]This guy wants to know about EDF Endgame.
[181:46.41]Okay.
[181:47.83]What would you like to know?
[181:48.57]Is this going to ask me anything?
[181:51.77]Are you going to lie to me?
[181:53.11]Yeah, AMA.
[181:56.01]Yes, sir.
[181:58.01]This stuff up here, how are you going to get it?
[181:59.59]Is the endgame in this better or worse than Karazhan?
[182:04.05]This is not World of Warcraft, so it's a better game.
[182:10.75]Right in the face.
[182:12.25]Still alive?
[182:18.00]Damn!
[182:18.94]What?
[182:21.08]Wait, what?
[182:21.84]I said that World of Warcraft- This mission sucks.
[182:26.92]What?
[182:27.26]Oh god, okay.
[182:32.37]Guys, I put like ten years into World of Warcraft.
[182:37.87]How does that make you feel?
[182:39.75]I mean, it was fun.
[182:42.53]But... Isn't, uh... What's the name of the new expansion?
[182:51.28]BOA?
[182:53.24]Bank of America?
[182:53.88]I think it's DOA.
[182:55.16]DOA?
[182:55.68]Yeah.
[182:57.46]Same joke.
[182:58.30]Clap.
[183:00.56]I had to drop my controller to clap.
[183:04.08]So it took me a second.
[183:05.88]World of Warcraft.
[183:07.10]Bank of America.
[183:09.49]Can I get one in the air?
[183:10.11]Let's see.
[183:10.41]I'm gonna try and bomb you.
[183:15.09]I'm actually being bombed.
[183:16.89]Are you gonna bomb me?
[183:21.24]You told me to tell you and now you're mad that I told you.
[183:24.56]Hey Star, what do you do?
[183:25.48]I'm gonna bomb you.
[183:33.30]This thing is really inaccurate.
[183:34.88]That's the problem here.
[183:35.66]It's not me.
[183:36.74]It's the game.
[183:39.18]Well, every gun has an accuracy rating, so... What was the red on the ground for?
[183:53.14]That's the air shotgun.
[183:55.06]It's inaccurate.
[183:56.73]It's inaccurate.
[183:59.52]Hey, can you hit anything?
[184:01.52]I just destroyed so many things.
[184:04.74]Don't Left 4 Dead me.
[184:05.60]I'd be number one.
[184:06.98]I wish we had one.
[184:08.96]I wish.
[184:13.30]I want to know.
[184:14.19]Because it would definitely be me at the bottom with my shotgun currently.
[184:29.77]Here comes another TV news report.
[184:31.27]Alright, I gotta quit.
[184:32.89]No, I'm running out of juice.
[184:34.20]I saved you.
[184:34.60]Put me on.
[184:34.94]Put me on your foot.
[184:46.61]Somebody's saying... That guy... That's not even a... These guys are also trying to jump on your foot.
[184:51.79]Timur, are Unitalics still friends?
[184:54.62]Um... I don't know.
[184:56.10]I mean, it's like... I talk to them sometimes, but... This is the first time I've talked to you since I moved in.
[185:01.86]Yeah.
[185:03.36]Alright, I'm on your foot.
[185:06.28]This mission is terrible.
[185:11.02]That was a lore mission.
[185:12.32]That was a Valley... Valley 2, the sequel.
[185:19.70]Ooh!
[185:21.60]No... Actually, that's... What are the... I like the grid shot.
[185:25.88]More radius?
[185:26.68]Let's try it this time.
[185:30.15]You start making noises.
[185:32.03]You are gonna get muted real quick.
[185:35.53]Speaking of... It's ironic coming from you.
[185:44.95]Great shot.
[185:45.77]Put it back on, and we have any indication of what this is gonna be?
[185:49.82]Uh, more saucers dropping ants.
[185:52.86]There weren't any saucers in that mission, but they, like, that you could kill.
[185:55.94]What's your favorite sauce?
[185:58.86]Honey mustard.
[185:59.42]Um...
[186:03.02]I mean, barbecue sauce can't go wrong.
[186:06.43]Barbecue sauce, honey mustard.
[186:07.37]There's like 80 kinds of barbecue, aren't there?
[186:09.49]I don't know which kind.
[186:10.89]I still haven't been to, like, authentic Texan barbecue experience.
[186:15.75]Oh, man.
[186:19.62]Mine's a tie between... What is barbecue sauce, though?
[186:22.04]I don't know.
[186:23.10]Ketchup, Worcestershire, and salt and seasoning.
[186:27.66]You're welcome.
[186:31.84]Yeah, you're welcome is what I'd be saying if we could play our game.
[186:36.22]I've been okayed.
[186:38.04]Shut your mouth.
[186:40.86]I paid $600 for this game.
[186:42.42]Also, you're in the equipment screen.
[186:43.96]Yeah, because I was waiting for you.
[186:48.57]Alfredo sauce is probably number one for me.
[186:50.37]You're the last one.
[186:52.85]Or Tabasco.
[186:55.11]Does that count?
[186:55.57]Those look like condiments, right?
[186:56.47]Those are sauces.
[186:59.72]I don't think those two are mutually exclusive.
[187:01.96]I said Worcestershire sauce, correct?
[187:03.24]Yeah.
[187:05.20]I cook every day.
[187:06.00]Uh, excuse me.
[187:11.64]What?
[187:14.50]Uh, 85% lie detected.
[187:17.00]Dude, I made us all perfect fucking medium steaks.
[187:22.94]Did you eat them all, too?
[187:24.69]I was educating you guys on proper...
[187:29.37]You made me what now?
[187:30.63]I was educating you guys on proper storage and use for... Hold on, I'm busy.
[187:34.92]How do you detonate C4?
[187:35.46]Probably L1?
[187:35.90]It is L1.
[187:36.48]This is by far the best weapon I probably have, right?
[187:55.66]What is happening?
[187:56.66]What are you doing?
[187:57.45]Who are we killing?
[187:58.85]I just see a laser show going on over here.
[188:01.39]What is that?
[188:01.99]Did somebody drop that?
[188:03.89]What the heck?
[188:05.21]That's an alien device, I think.
[188:08.13]What the fuck is that thing?
[188:14.76]You're good, I joke.
[188:16.80]Well done.
[188:19.30]Well done, steak.
[188:23.76]I mean, I'm like a medium to medium well.
[188:27.84]Well done.
[188:28.28]I mean... No, I don't know if I would... I don't know.
[188:32.36]I don't really eat that much steak.
[188:33.58]I don't eat a whole lot of red meat.
[188:37.10]Did you guys eat any fish like I told you to?
[188:38.81]Um... You told me to eat fish.
[188:47.37]Alex, you remember the succulent salmon that I made for us last night?
[188:50.83]Excuse me, I can't hear you.
[188:51.81]The game got very loud.
[188:56.43]Did you say salmon last night?
[188:57.87]Remember the succulent buttery salmon that I made last night?
[189:05.27]I mean, there was fish about a month and a half ago.
[189:08.19]Succulent.
[189:14.51]It was a while.
[189:17.12]Do you remember it, though?
[189:19.74]Yeah.
[189:20.70]How could I forget the only time you've cooked so far?
[189:26.62]That's not true.
[189:27.52]What about the sausages?
[189:29.22]Not true.
[189:30.42]What about the sausages?
[189:31.10]What about the shrimp that I made?
[189:32.06]What about the shrimp that I made?
[189:33.08]Why not?
[189:33.48]He won't say it.
[189:34.08]He won't say it.
[189:34.76]He won't say it.
[189:35.48]Say it.
[189:35.70]I have a shrimp intolerance.
[189:37.56]I don't think I can cancel this.
[189:57.54]Cancel!
[190:02.86]I'm like in the bomb dropping menu ready to drop.
[190:05.30]Oh, there it goes.
[190:07.22]He just dropped like a train.
[190:09.85]Can I get in that?
[190:11.75]Oh, I can actually.
[190:12.73]Yes, I can.
[190:14.19]Oh, I can too.
[190:15.29]Me too!
[190:15.87]Monster carnival.
[190:21.75]That sounds... not so bad actually.
[190:24.91]What would even happen at a monster carnival?
[190:29.31]Well, we kind of... I mean, that was basically TwitchCon last year.
[190:33.51]Yeah, actually it was.
[190:37.61]Well, it looks kind of like they're all dead.
[190:43.17]Kind of.
[190:43.47]Alright, I'm going on collection mode here.
[190:46.51]Is the whole world like this now?
[190:49.61]Is the whole world like this?
[190:52.17]I can't believe it's really happening.
[190:55.57]Pull it together.
[190:56.17]We'll be okay after we defeat the monsters.
[190:58.75]I think C4 is a little dangerous.
[191:01.35]I got him.
[191:01.67]But I didn't though.
[191:03.27]What?
[191:04.15]C4 is not dangerous.
[191:06.67]I have tons of it.
[191:09.46]I've never gotten hurt.
[191:10.28]A little bit of oregano.
[191:11.16]A little bit of garlic.
[191:12.22]Chop it up.
[191:12.64]Some butter.
[191:13.04]Pour a little white wine.
[191:13.66]What are you talking about?
[191:17.60]What?
[191:17.84]You're good.
[191:18.58]Are you just... Dreaming about cooking?
[191:22.55]Somebody... People are asking what I was talking about.
[191:25.45]Is that oregano?
[191:26.33]That was me.
[191:28.21]Yeah, that's what I'm explaining.
[191:29.93]Oregano.
[191:30.83]White wine.
[191:31.23]A little bit of butter.
[191:32.51]A lot of butter, actually.
[191:33.85]What are you making?
[191:34.53]The thing that I made, like, last night.
[191:36.91]Oh.
[191:38.83]Saute?
[191:40.17]Make sure you, like... Here's how you... I'm only, like, pretending to cook.
[191:42.57]This is how you pretend to cook, guys.
[191:45.09]You just, like, put stuff in there, and even if you're not supposed to move it around, just, like, shake it around and, like, push it up in the pan and stuff.
[191:49.85]Shake, swirl, swirl, swirl, flip, flip, shake, swirl, swirl.
[191:52.20]You do just kind of... You're supposed to flip it.
[191:55.68]And Ster it.
[191:57.66]You said my name!
[192:01.96]Ice Cold Snowy Top Hat Santa.
[192:04.09]What the fuck are you guys doing in this chat room?
[192:07.79]Snowy Top Hat Santa snow.
[192:10.51]Ice!

[193:21.92]Yeah, we're wiping, dude.
[193:23.14]No, we're not.
[193:24.70]I told you not to bring him in here.
[193:26.60]His gear score.
[193:27.98]World of Warcraft?
[193:30.85]Get this high elf over here.
[193:34.01]Anybody here a wowhead?
[193:38.69]Look at all those weapons.
[193:40.23]I'm going for it.
[193:47.95]Anybody go to wildhead.com?
[193:55.18]Everybody did because you could not see the quest before.
[193:58.00]Is that a real website?
[194:01.44]I thought that was like a... Oh, that's a very real website that you had to use.
[194:04.94]I thought that was like an SFM porn thing.
[194:09.24]You would just go there to complete your quest.
[194:12.88]A safe for Mork?
[194:14.66]What?
[194:15.24]A source filmmaker.
[194:16.64]Oh.
[194:20.36]SFM porn thing.
[194:23.52]Yeah, Wild Head.
[194:26.91]No?
[194:28.21]I don't know anything about it.
[194:30.63]I got cruise missiles!
[194:34.39]I got the Deathcrawler!
[194:36.33]What the fuck?
[194:40.40]Short range.
[194:41.44]Balance.
[194:42.80]False machine gun, a little bit better.
[194:44.30]Bolt shooter, a little bit better.
[194:45.72]Congratulations.
[194:47.30]You are enrolled.
[194:48.72]Finally, a new turbo core.
[194:51.22]Five months have passed since the alien invasion.
[194:53.84]We fought hard.
[194:55.12]But as long as the large flying saucers remain out there, our days of hardship will not be over.
[194:59.27]Is there even safe for work porn?
[195:03.01]I don't... Yeah.
[195:05.47]You saw that scam show, right?
[195:06.73]Where the guy made fully clothed
[195:10.44]The scam show?
[195:11.82]There was a guy for a little while that did a show where he would scam other people on his show.
[195:17.78]And it got canceled because he was doing illegal shit.
[195:22.14]But one of the episodes was that he convinced a whole bunch of people to show up to a porn movie reveal party.
[195:29.73]And he got top executives from the porn industry.
[195:33.41]And his movie was like, they just keep putting on more clothes.
[195:37.93]They, like, start in jackets, and they just keep putting on more, and they, like, put pillows between them, and everyone is very upset, and he leaves.
[195:43.99]That was the whole episode.
[195:50.34]Was that just, like, a H3H3 video?
[195:52.56]No, is that Nathan For You?
[195:55.16]That might be.
[195:56.54]Wait, Nathan For You got canceled?
[195:57.80]We talked about this, like, a few years ago.
[195:59.90]I've seen the show.
[196:01.56]Yeah, but I'm pretty sure it got canceled, like, through season one.
[196:05.94]I did it?
[196:09.81]I'm pretty sure.
[196:10.79]It's still on.
[196:14.07]Hey, thanks for the facts, Star.
[196:17.12]Hey, sorry.
[196:17.66]You can't all be, you know, geniuses.
[196:23.10]Like some of the people here in this call right now are geniuses.
[196:27.14]Can't be all of us.
[196:28.56]But who is it, though?
[196:30.34]How many?
[196:31.12]Also not a scam show.
[196:32.55]Wasn't cancelled.
[196:33.73]Fact!
[196:35.07]Scam show.
[196:35.67]Fact!
[196:38.44]It's a show where we scam people.
[196:41.74]That's what I thought it was.
[196:43.58]One of the other episodes, wasn't it he pretended to be Brad Pitt or something to get free food from a restaurant?
[196:48.76]How's that not a scam?
[196:50.42]You're thinking of Con Man from Comedy Central.
[196:53.22]Like 10, 15, 20 years ago.
[196:54.41]Well, I'm dead.
[197:00.05]It had to be done at least once.
[197:01.67]Maybe I'm mixing up shows.
[197:02.97]I don't know.
[197:03.39]Is there not just a restart button?
[197:08.12]That's a guy that used to say to spray paint fucking, like, mile-per-hour signs.
[197:13.04]If you get, like, a ticket.
[197:13.60]Can you just not talk to me anymore?
[197:14.78]That show did get cancelled.
[197:16.04]The guy used to talk about... Yeah, that show got cancelled.
[197:19.46]I don't even... What is Nathan for you?
[197:21.83]Are these two shows?
[197:23.23]Yeah, the guy was doing illegal shit.
[197:25.76]One of the episodes he did like a fake porn thing and he got all the executives to show up Are you sure you think okay?
[197:31.86]We're thinking of two shows you combine them together.
[197:34.94]Just Google it Google fake porn thing.
[197:36.42]Oh
[197:51.23]And then he puts the cushion in between them and he says, more cushion for the pushing.
[197:54.49]Oh, you fucking goddammit.
[197:57.17]Google fake porn cushion thing.
[197:59.39]This is what happened on the show.
[198:01.33]Who were the pornics?
[198:03.23]I don't know.
[198:03.80]They, like, ran, like, Hustler and stuff.
[198:06.08]And he, like, got important people to show up.
[198:09.00]Are you sure this was just a fucked up dream you had, like, three days ago?
[198:11.84]No.
[198:13.08]Someone in my chat said they remembered it.
[198:15.30]I don't want to die.
[198:17.92]...attacks by the new types fail.
[198:20.26]Oh, that pig is gonna die.
[198:21.70]Yes, Mr. Hustler was there.
[198:25.68]Nobody's gonna laugh.
[198:26.52]Well, I just got out boomered.
[198:29.38]That's what somebody said.
[198:30.98]What the fuck?
[198:47.97]I hope we don't fail this mission and have to listen to these people talk again.
[198:51.15]Hey, you want some gum?
[198:52.75]Oh, fuck.
[198:53.93]You made me do that because I was doing a stunt.
[198:55.37]Are you chewing gum?
[198:56.91]I'm eating gum.
[198:57.77]You eat gum.
[198:58.31]You don't chew it.
[198:59.49]Nathan's show is going to businesses and giving them really weird advice that works somehow.
[199:03.73]Yeah, no.
[199:04.09]Definitely that porn thing was con, man.
[199:06.26]We have to retreat!

[201:54.81]That this new generation doesn't appreciate.

[203:00.74]That was happening... Seriously, that was happening to me, too.
[203:04.00]I'm getting a cramp.
[203:06.35]You're getting a PlayStation 4 cramp?
[203:08.89]I am getting a PlayStation 4 claw grip cramp.
[203:12.33]Cramp.
[203:13.60]Oh, I gotta get up higher.
[203:14.40]That's how you know you're trying just hard enough.
[203:16.60]It's the perfect level to be at.
[203:20.10]And this spider can only jump left.
[203:21.56]I gotta get higher than that.
[203:22.58]Fuck!
[203:24.57]Oh, it's opening.
[203:26.73]Oh no, it just closed.
[203:27.83]Wait, did it?
[203:28.75]I got some shots in there.
[203:29.55]I gotta wait.
[203:29.87]I gotta get up.
[203:30.33]I gotta fly up there.
[203:32.09]I need some... I might actually be able to use this.
[203:38.84]It's opening!
[203:39.78]It's opening!
[203:40.50]Is it actually hitting it, or is it just stopping short?
[203:44.26]Fuck, I gotta get way higher than that.
[203:45.94]I can't do anything until I have full charge here.
[203:50.03]I don't... This thing, like, tilts so much.
[203:53.77]There's a lot to your left.
[203:58.63]Yeah!
[204:05.86]Does anyone else ghost, Michelle?
[204:06.96]I was gonna say that, but I don't think I knew what it was.
[204:11.66]A Metal Gear?
[204:13.75]Wow, I love these references.
[204:15.79]I'm done with it.
[204:19.34]I'll try it.
[204:19.78]Thanks for your hand-me-down.
[204:22.80]Man, this thing doesn't want to go down.
[204:27.36]Yeah, Jap doesn't realize I watch literally anime every day.
[204:33.13]Oh chat, you don't even realize how much anime I watch.
[204:37.43]I watch so much.
[204:40.13]You guys don't think I watch all that anime?
[204:42.37]Watch this one.
[204:42.95]You wanna see fun?
[204:43.71]I'll show you an anime.
[204:45.27]We found the 15% truth kernel.
[204:48.00]Take a look at that.
[204:52.26]I'll show you an anime.
[204:54.60]Just wait until I send my giant big red rocket in.
[204:59.60]Can't you just call it anything else?
[205:01.70]Here it comes.
[205:03.52]Here it comes.
[205:04.96]I did that.
[205:06.68]It's very... There it is.
[205:09.30]Can't you call it anything else?
[205:11.36]Killed like two bugs.
[205:12.76]Bugs kill.
[205:13.24]Killed like two bugs.
[205:21.26]This jump sucks.
[205:22.32]Ow.
[205:23.87]I'm going to need a little bit of help here.
[205:28.97]Well, just run towards me.
[205:31.63]You need me.
[205:38.23]Sorry, we're like playing in our toy spiders.
[205:40.73]We kinda are just in the toy spiders.
[205:42.88]Well, you guys kill.
[205:43.96]I'm gonna collect armor.
[205:44.66]To be fair, they're pretty good at what they do.
[205:46.56]It's opening.
[205:47.12]I... I... Dude, there's so much stuff that I need to pick up.
[205:50.64]This is the... We can't just... I gotta get it.
[205:52.64]So... Don't skip.
[205:54.73]Oh, you're saying we stay here and we farm this?
[205:56.83]We farm and sim until... Sim and farm and... We're getting it.
[206:02.09]Star, have you ever seen JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?
[206:04.17]Oh, God.
[206:05.23]No, never heard of it.
[206:06.91]Okay, well... Did you make a reference earlier?
[206:10.15]Hmm?
[206:11.41]No.
[206:12.21]You didn't make a JoJo's Bazaar?
[206:14.15]He definitely did.
[206:19.29]I think he did.
[206:19.73]He even said the words JoJo.
[206:21.19]He did say that.
[206:23.01]You did do that.
[206:24.31]Explain yourself.
[206:25.09]No, no.
[206:25.57]I have a friend named Joanne, and we call her JoJo.
[206:27.93]Okay.
[206:30.19]Does she happen to know someone else named Dio?
[206:34.35]No.
[206:34.87]Why do you know that?
[206:35.53]Because I've seen the first two episodes.
[206:38.81]Oh.
[206:39.11]Which is more than you've seen.
[206:42.03]Shut up, man.
[206:43.11]I said I watched it.
[206:48.17]Honestly, I don't know how, like, you can continue having a Twitch channel and, like, people will watch you and you haven't seen JoJo's Bavar Adventure.
[206:55.35]Shut the fuck up, man.
[206:57.23]Shut up.
[206:58.09]People haven't realized you're a fraud yet.
[206:59.95]Shut up!
[207:00.27]85% lie detected.
[207:04.82]Where is this thing?
[207:08.65]Screw this.
[207:10.07]Yeah.
[207:10.57]Do we both exit the spider at the exact same time?
[207:13.69]Don't worry.
[207:14.15]I'll take care of it.
[207:14.91]It's opening.
[207:17.91]That's really far away.
[207:19.45]It's going to take a lot of flying demon shooters once.
[207:22.83]Why is this an action?
[207:23.97]This is the third time I've referenced Dragon Bajie, but the pink thing is just... It's coming.
[207:31.93]Whose pink thing is that?
[207:35.49]Who's got the, like, 4th of July firework weapon?
[207:38.37]It's me.
[207:39.86]It shoots homing missiles at everything.
[207:41.52]It's, like, just a super special.
[207:46.22]It has a, like, it's like a five-minute wow cooldown.
[207:49.70]Alright, I'm back on collecting duty.
[207:52.38]This is like World of Warcraft.
[207:57.23]You guys figure out what you want to do, because I need to collect... I don't have a gun that can shoot up into that.
[208:01.63]It's opening again.
[208:02.92]It's really hard.
[208:03.54]I also do not have a gun that can shoot up into that.
[208:05.46]I guess I have to get back into Stupid Spire.
[208:09.26]Hey, I will join you.
[208:11.50]Well, what do you want me to do?
[208:12.18]Do you want me to win the game for us, or do you want me to collect items?
[208:14.92]Win the game.
[208:15.70]Win the game.
[208:16.66]But do you want weapons and armor, or do you want me to beat the game for us all?
[208:20.24]I want you to beat the game for me.
[208:22.34]We've been here for, like, a million years.
[208:24.36]We have kind of been killing ants for a long time.
[208:27.83]But we need all this stuff.
[208:30.05]We're gonna get this stuff if we, like, beat this level.
[208:33.19]Okay, alright, slow down.
[208:35.48]Oh my god, sometimes this thing movement accelerates out of nowhere.
[208:39.72]What, the spider?
[208:40.87]Yeah.
[208:41.63]Are you hitting L2?
[208:42.29]No.
[208:43.37]No, I mean like the aiming will jump like... Oh, yeah.
[208:50.71]Alright, I got one shot in.
[208:52.71]I have to wait until I get full charge again.
[208:54.78]Okay, let's do it again.
[208:57.66]Alright, nice in-sync shooting here.
[209:05.57]Watch out for the ants, Jerma.
[209:07.35]I'll be fine.
[209:07.75]Oh my god.
[209:08.43]Oh, only one of my guns has ammo.
[209:10.81]What?
[209:11.69]Yeah.
[209:11.93]That was the old one that I like jumped out of and you had first.
[209:15.59]You only shot with one size?
[209:18.28]No.
[209:19.52]Alright.
[209:19.74]Here we go.
[209:20.04]What's your problem?
[209:21.30]It was like that when I got it.
[209:22.60]I doubt that.
[209:24.44]I doubt that very much.
[209:27.12]Look.
[209:27.32]I got it from the pawn shop.
[209:29.92]The pawn?
[209:30.50]Open.
[209:33.97]Why is there a third spider?
[209:36.32]I called another one in.
[209:37.64]Did I do it?
[209:40.88]I did it.
[209:43.08]We did it.
[209:44.10]I... I did it, actually.
[209:46.38]Smiley face.
[209:47.24]We did that.
[209:48.58]Smiley face in all capitals.
[209:59.21]Alright, now... I'm actually surprised we haven't done, like, a hive mission.
[210:03.07]Well, there are, like, 175 missions in the game.
[210:06.22]I don't know, but I'm just saying I would have thought there would have been one by now.
[210:08.46]But we're focused on these stupid flying teleportation vehicles with their golden armor.
[210:13.80]Look, they gotta pace the game, you know?
[210:15.32]They can't just use all the enemy types in the first five missions.
[210:18.51]I think I got all the boxes.
[210:19.99]I mean, it's ants.
[210:20.57]You know what I'm saying?
[210:24.55]They're usually in there pretty early.
[210:28.37]You guys are gonna be so happy when you were upset earlier with...
[210:32.15]Wow, what's he doing?
[210:32.79]What were we upset with?
[210:34.03]You were mad that I wasn't destroying the saucers, but wait till you see how much health you just got.
[210:38.67]And wait to see how many weapons you're gonna get from this.
[210:41.67]And it's a thankless job, right?
[210:44.09]Smack!
[210:45.41]Did you just kill a fly?
[210:49.15]Nice work.
[210:51.13]I got a suppressed gun, thanks Jorma.
[210:54.66]I got a bunch of upgrades.
[210:55.44]Also, I noticed that it's raising HP for all the classes, not just one of them.
[210:59.68]That is true.
[211:01.74]Interesting.
[211:02.28]Maybe they got rid of that.
[211:02.96]But I've got, like, more for my class to play.
[211:05.88]So that would be nice if they made it so that you can actually change characters in this game.
[211:12.23]Bolt the shooter.
[211:15.73]I keep getting upgrades for this, but I don't really like it.
[211:18.65]It's too slow.
[211:23.95]How is a grenade more accurate?
[211:35.78]I'm gonna grape it up.
[211:43.26]This thing's cool, but... Hmm.
[211:53.30]I'll go back to this thing.
[212:05.07]It's my clock?
[212:05.97]What do you mean, my clock?
[212:16.21]I wish you could upgrade for this.
[212:19.73]Mmm, I'll keep it on, whatever.
[212:31.03]He's eating boogers?
[212:33.27]What the fuck are you talking about?
[212:37.38]Booger eating stream.
[212:58.92]Do we know what kind of enemies we're going to fight?
[213:00.48]Or just monsters?
[213:01.86]I think it's monsters.
[213:03.42]I think they might be introducing a new one.
[213:06.10]No.
[213:07.28]Maybe they do anthills in this one.
[213:08.58]I don't know.
[213:08.88]You don't know what you should have right now.
[213:13.40]Okay, I'll pick a Gatorade.
[213:15.82]I know what you want.
[213:16.40]Hold on.
[213:17.45]When do I get tanks?
[213:20.79]What should I call it?
[213:21.61]What do they call them?
[213:22.65]Pina Coladas.
[213:24.23]No, I just want to slam a blue Gatorade right now.
[213:28.24]Oh my god.
[213:30.12]Like from Fortnite?
[213:32.16]Slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp?
[213:34.74]You a Fortnite guy?
[213:37.10]Yeah, whatever.
[213:48.95]Slurp juice, actually, is what it's called.
[213:53.05]Slug jug.
[213:53.31]Slug jug.
[213:54.92]Slug jug chug off.
[213:55.94]That's what I was thinking of.
[213:57.36]Slug jug chug off?
[213:59.76]Yeah, we did it at the tip of the hat.
[214:01.70]We had a slug jug chug off.
[214:06.20]Oh.
[214:08.06]Well, this thing is.
[214:08.70]Did someone just call me a newbie?
[214:09.98]Yep.
[214:11.44]Oh, yeah.
[214:11.66]In this game, don't they call you a newbie up to, like, mission 100?
[214:13.68]I think they do.
[214:20.02]Let's start the fire.
[214:21.28]Let's go.
[214:29.98]This thing is really, really great.
[214:31.94]Yeah, but I can't fly when I use this.
[214:34.12]It's way too much.
[214:35.22]This is a residential area.
[214:41.36]Well, we're kind of ruining everything.
[214:50.77]Yeah, I'm pulling in a lot of bombs.
[214:54.49]Uh, here are the spiders.
[214:55.45]Yeah, those are spiders.
[215:02.28]He's coming up from the ground.
[215:03.26]This thing is really, actually really good.
[215:16.50]Better than what... your have.
[215:20.90]Better than what your have.
[215:28.66]Better than what your have.
[215:30.06]Can you run that by me again?
[215:35.97]I'm sorry, what are you saying?
[215:38.69]I'm talking?
[215:39.01]No.
[215:39.79]Nah.
[215:40.41]Don't worry about me.
[215:41.25]Nah.
[215:44.23]I am afraid of confrontation, so...
[215:48.00]I actually had my homing fireworks right now.
[215:52.68]This thing can just go.
[216:01.34]This thing really just, it just goes.
[216:05.58]It just goes.
[216:06.26]It didn't, if you could see my screen, you'd know what I'm talking about.
[216:09.78]What gun?
[216:10.94]My electric.
[216:12.76]Oh.
[216:13.18]My electric faucet gun.
[216:14.16]The pink one?
[216:15.84]Um, no, no.
[216:17.26]My plasma balls.
[216:19.74]Plasma balls.
[216:21.00]Yeah, it just goes, dude.
[216:22.88]Why do you get all the, like, toy trucks?
[216:25.03]Because he's doing the toy truck class.
[216:27.95]And everyone can get in it.
[216:29.13]Everyone fits in it.
[216:30.81]Oh.
[216:31.97]Okay, first person mode engaged.
[216:34.05]Wait, I want to play.
[216:36.66]You really don't.
[216:37.70]There's nothing to do back here.
[216:39.09]This is like to get everyone to a new spot.
[216:41.69]This is for the viewers, though, man.
[216:43.31]Hey, come on in, and at least I'll have someone to look at.
[216:45.47]Okay.
[216:49.77]Not exactly what I had in mind.
[216:51.49]I want to get in.
[216:53.77]I can't look down.
[216:54.71]Alright.
[216:55.83]Star, get in again.
[216:56.77]If I look down, then I'm going to get banned on Twitter.
[216:59.53]I'm going to drive you guys to the next mission.
[217:03.99]I can't look down.
[217:04.71]Quit running in trees.
[217:06.37]You got a mask over your eyes, so I don't know where your eyes are, Jerma.
[217:12.27]Are you looking left and right?
[217:14.37]You're just doing this little... Yeah, I'm looking left and right because if I look down, you're not decent.
[217:20.55]Just like in real life.
[217:21.71]Where are you taking us?
[217:24.65]We're just driving in a circle.
[217:26.53]No, I'm driving us to the enemies.
[217:28.07]Get out.
[217:28.61]It's enemy time.
[217:30.05]Oh, you can see me too.
[217:31.13]No, I don't want to get out.
[217:32.37]No.
[217:33.55]Away.
[217:34.03]I need you.
[217:36.98]I'm not getting out.
[217:38.73]You deal with it.
[217:39.23]I really need help.
[217:43.49]You got it!
[217:45.67]Ding!
[217:47.83]Dong!
[217:52.10]Dong, huh?
[217:55.46]That's the doorbell.
[218:04.09]Oh, they've got me.
[218:05.15]I tried to line up a bombie, but they're red.
[218:07.63]They're red studs.
[218:08.94]I got you.
[218:09.24]I got you.
[218:09.68]I got you.
[218:10.28]I got you.
[218:11.60]Almost got you.
[218:12.70]Ooh, they have more HP.
[218:15.50]Alright, collection time to go.
[218:17.10]I don't know if you heard me, Jerma, but the character is not decent down there.
[218:22.27]Well, you've got to warn me on this stuff, Star.
[218:26.29]Hold on.
[218:26.79]Dude, don't talk over the chief commander.
[218:34.54]this type of ship is now designated as mothership really the mothership I didn't I reacted oh boy so every time you get an armor it permanently adds it what's like a good amount of armor to have
[218:58.03]Uh, hundreds.
[218:59.69]Is it just damage negation, or is it like HP?
[219:02.37]It's just HP, I think.
[219:04.33]It's just HP.
[219:07.55]At least that's what I think.
[219:10.40]See, it says armor in here, but it says HP when you finish a mission, but I'm pretty sure it's damage negation.
[219:16.02]Hmm.
[219:17.39]It depends on the class.
[219:18.47]Depends on the class.
[219:21.59]What class you are, it would mitigate damage in different amounts.
[219:29.39]Here comes an air strike.
[219:31.34]Goodbye.
[219:34.86]I would like them to use some air vehicles.
[219:39.14]Because I can kill those.
[219:42.90]Behind us, it looks like.
[219:45.60]It's like some kind of currency thing?
[219:47.08]It might be.
[219:47.98]Are we missing somebody?
[219:52.62]Is it one ant over there?
[219:54.07]Yeah, I got it.
[219:57.69]I'm gonna do some driving.
[220:04.62]I'm gonna make my way over this way.
[220:06.32]It looks like just a handful of ants.
[220:09.48]I'm in.
[220:10.98]Oh yeah, we're coming.
[220:13.84]Whoops-a-daisy.
[220:15.18]Okay.
[220:16.24]Watch out, here comes the Grape.
[220:19.97]Is there a mothership?
[220:21.51]I don't know.
[220:21.89]Watch out, here comes the Grape.
[220:22.73]What is happening?
[220:23.49]I think it's just these ants over here.
[220:25.83]At the moment.
[220:27.73]Glad this mission's not gonna show my kill count.
[220:29.57]I think I'm gonna switch back to the class.
[220:30.83]I think that's because you guys are carrying right now.
[220:38.11]What are you on?
[220:38.53]You still on, um... I'm still on the soldier guy.
[220:41.66]Ranger.
[220:44.22]I thought I was going to get named Raider.
[220:46.04]Whoa, that happened out of nowhere.
[220:48.22]Good thing I got this.
[220:53.70]Ranger!
[220:54.40]Before, they were coming from the sky.
[220:55.80]Now they're coming from the ground.
[220:57.82]I'm being eaten.
[221:02.69]Very slowly.
[221:03.49]Oh, boy.
[221:07.55]They have a lot of armor.
[221:08.97]Yes, they do.
[221:09.93]Yes, they do.
[221:12.71]I'll save you.
[221:15.69]Oh boy.
[221:17.43]Juice, because I don't have any.
[221:22.30]Ah, now I'm going to get picked up.
[221:23.52]It's inevitable.
[221:26.02]It's inevitable.
[221:27.22]Ah, yep, it is.
[221:30.25]What?
[221:30.47]I might just get picked up, but I can probably get out.
[221:32.55]Are you down?
[221:33.45]No, I'm like... I can... I can get you.
[221:35.57]No, I'm going to... I can... I can come... I can come and... Ragdoll's pretty great.
[221:46.04]God, stop eating me.
[221:49.56]Aye, aye, aye, aye.
[221:50.54]It's got eaten again.
[221:51.58]This is bad.
[221:54.12]Who's with me inside the airstrike?
[221:56.85]Being eaten by bugs.
[222:00.45]Hey!
[222:01.99]Oh, hey there, bud.
[222:03.57]Did we just go into outer space?
[222:04.99]It must be.
[222:06.06]oh no uh you're on the ground I think I'm trying to get to you but I'm underneath the giant red ant ass you know you can still shoot while you're being eaten yeah that like helps you free yourself yeah I killed myself with explosives well that was a little hairy
[222:35.28]I got you.
[222:36.70]On the floor?
[222:37.26]Did we go into space?
[222:38.26]Well, initially, that initial explosion, I thought I went over the mountains.
[222:41.29]This isn't just a World War.
[222:43.41]It's a space war!
[222:44.99]It is a space war.
[222:48.31]Any other... Wait.
[222:52.37]This isn't just a ground war.
[222:58.26]We're from space!
[222:59.86]Clans will follow up.
[223:01.58]We did get napalm, though.
[223:04.47]Maybe we should be playing with grenades.
[223:05.99]Plasmafall, I just, I need a corridor.
[223:10.31]I need a long stretch of land for it to work very well.
[223:20.00]Okay.
[223:23.95]We might, okay, this might be the destroy the mothership mission.
[223:27.40]It's a Destroy the Mother's Prohibition that I'm going to pick.
[223:30.44]So you have to shoot up into it, but I think it also drops stuff.
[223:33.86]I need this to level up.
[223:36.48]What's the best thing I got?
[223:37.34]Probably this.
[223:40.64]Oh, you can use level 5 stuff now.
[223:42.88]Yeah.
[223:45.58]Bolt Shooter, no.
[223:47.62]Plasma Fall, man.
[223:48.56]I'm going to get rid of these special right now.
[223:51.93]I feel like it's good, but I'd rather have more things to shoot.
[223:55.23]So I'm going to go Lightning Bolt M2.
[223:57.99]I haven't got any more deployable guns I'm gonna go with this thing for the ships this is a stream why what again why is everybody quiet ready you know what I need actually why is everybody doing dot dot dot
[224:34.64]What's happening?
[224:35.42]Why is everybody so quiet?
[224:37.96]What?
[224:38.68]Everybody's just doing dot dot dots.
[224:40.30]Everyone's just being silent in this chat right now.
[224:42.22]Oh, we... Um, I don't know.
[224:48.25]He doesn't know.
[224:49.03]Resident Boomer.
[225:02.81]That's how, because you know that you're muted, right?
[225:04.89]Yeah, I was muted on purpose, because I was just like, hey, what am I going to switch to here?
[225:09.73]Talking like stuff you don't need to hear, you know?
[225:12.03]Oh, oh, oh.
[225:14.21]Well, you might need, you don't want to hear.
[225:15.73]I'm switching back to the other guy, because I have a new exoskeleton that makes me faster.
[225:22.35]I'm laughing my ass off.
[225:25.27]You should uninstall.
[225:26.29]What?
[225:30.10]I am ready to go.
[225:32.06]Alright.
[225:32.84]I have to switch my class entirely.
[225:34.92]Don't tell... What do you... My webcam's not on, first of all.
[225:42.17]Um... Who are we fighting?
[225:45.83]We are fading.
[225:46.65]The mothership.
[225:47.67]The mothership.
[225:49.29]Destroy the giant ship.
[225:51.91]So bring something that you can use.
[225:55.08]We suspect they keep themselves low in order to drop monsters.
[225:58.28]The damage will be incalculable if we don't do something.
[226:00.96]Alright.
[226:01.98]Need to know if the socks have arrived.
[226:03.42]No, they've not.
[226:06.10]Yeah, I'm playing as the fencer again.
[226:10.06]New and improved.
[226:11.42]You are so cute.
[226:14.54]When are you going to shave?
[226:16.04]Wow, that's big.
[226:18.01]I was going to shave today, but I didn't.
[226:19.57]Very big.
[226:20.21]Sir, do you even have to shave?
[226:26.65]Never.
[226:27.45]I've never, ever shaved.
[226:30.13]Hmm.
[226:32.08]Okay.
[226:38.34]I'll handle it.
[226:40.28]Oh, they said we don't have to deal with the mothership, but there's YA boys anyways.
[226:51.45]Flying saucers.
[226:52.41]This could get really, really bad.
[226:56.87]And hello there, sir.
[226:58.03]What are you doing up here?
[227:01.14]Up where?
[227:03.96]Just a couple of fucking idiots, don't worry.
[227:09.40]Fuck.
[227:15.80]Boom.
[227:17.52]What the hell is it trying to do?
[227:19.12]Who cares?
[227:20.72]Take out the monster!
[227:22.62]Bug!
[227:23.98]Up!
[227:25.12]These are the guys that hit really hard too.
[227:30.87]My artillery is going to hit the air, guys.
[227:32.95]Don't worry.
[227:36.07]Oh, I don't have a dash with this.
[227:41.92]Easy.
[227:42.44]Easy airstrike.
[227:45.02]Maybe I should not have switched yet.
[227:48.16]Boom.
[227:49.54]I would love your anti-air guns here.
[227:51.56]Yeah, I didn't realize that I was switching at the bad moment.
[227:57.23]I'm going to get off.
[227:58.43]Oh my god.
[228:04.77]Oh, that hurts.
[228:05.67]Oh, you're dying too, so I'm not the only one.
[228:12.07]Any health?
[228:19.98]Got to reload my sword.
[228:24.00]I don't see any health.
[228:25.44]You're going to die.
[228:26.38]Oh, yes, I am.
[228:28.29]I'm trying to find health before that happens, inevitably.
[228:31.75]You have swords and stuff.
[228:34.15]I do, but they said they didn't attack aerial units.
[228:37.53]See?
[228:37.73]Look at that.
[228:41.15]Even goes, hee-haw, before he does it.
[228:45.27]You mean aliens.
[228:54.24]So we have to actually fight real, like, humanoids.
[228:58.12]This is unbelievable.
[228:59.92]How you guys doing?
[229:01.82]Oh my god.
[229:03.24]You guys alright?
[229:10.70]You know what, I'm doing okay.
[229:13.60]Doing better now.
[229:15.84]My game audio keeps going off.
[229:18.10]Game audio is going off.
[229:19.82]What the heck is happening there?
[229:21.62]What the heck?
[229:22.18]I don't know, man.
[229:24.00]Trying to figure that out.
[229:30.62]No health.
[229:31.12]What's with no health drop?
[229:32.08]It's all armor.
[229:33.80]Surprisingly, these swords can kill flying saucers.
[229:37.02]There you go.
[229:45.77]I'm getting like a 20 times damage bonus from Jazz.
[229:49.69]From Jazz?
[229:50.69]From Chat.
[229:51.59]From Jazz.
[229:51.99]Chat's giving you a 20% buff.
[229:53.69]No, not Chat.
[229:54.45]Jazz.
[229:55.29]He's listening to Jazz.
[229:56.19]Okay.
[229:56.55]Are you listening to Jazz?
[229:59.21]Is it like that Ocean's Eleven scene where he has to go through the, like, lasers, but he, like, puts in his headphones and he turns on his jazz music?
[230:05.96]Oh, boy.
[230:08.58]I think we're gonna... Okay, we got canisters of monsters with swords.
[230:12.16]Can I shoot him out of the air?
[230:16.05]Probably.
[230:18.11]I don't think so.
[230:18.91]Uh...
[230:31.01]What are we supposed to be shooting right now?
[230:32.50]I think we're just supposed to... There they go.
[230:35.50]Oh.
[230:36.18]It's the Ninja Turtles.
[230:37.14]Oh, boy.
[230:37.58]Is this the... Yeah, there's the frogs.
[230:40.52]Oh, my God.
[230:41.40]This is awesome.
[230:44.18]Holy shit, they're strong.
[230:45.60]Don't go head-on.
[230:49.43]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[230:51.51]I'm dead.
[230:52.39]It's Frog Champ.
[230:54.71]Oh, my audio.
[230:57.27]I'm fucking dead.
[231:00.50]Oh, you... Yeah, I looked down the hallway.
[231:02.68]Oh, you died pretty far away, didn't you?
[231:04.02]I'm down here, yeah.
[231:06.90]Uh, I'm summoning Mech.
[231:08.20]Frog Champ.
[231:09.58]And then I'll come to you.
[231:12.79]Oh, I think he just used a building as cover.
[231:15.13]Like, he put his back to the building.
[231:17.29]That's so stupid.
[231:20.87]Oh my god!
[231:24.26]Oh, they look like humans, says the guy.
[231:28.42]I was fixing my earphone.
[231:30.56]It looked just like you.
[231:32.96]Fucking headphone fell out.
[231:39.03]This dumbass headphone fell out.
[231:40.81]Sorry, are you live?
[231:42.03]Oh, you're in the mech.
[231:56.39]There's still a lot.
[231:57.23]They're just circling the buildings.
[232:00.93]Oh my god, their, like, arms come off?
[232:02.99]Yeah, these things are scary.
[232:08.35]That guy has no arms.
[232:10.31]He's running around with no arms.
[232:16.06]He's just screaming and running away.
[232:19.64]He's...
[232:24.17]Oh, they regenerate, by the way.
[232:25.71]That guy regenerated all of his body.
[232:29.39]They're attacking!
[232:32.83]The enemies are hiding in the shadows of buildings.
[232:35.28]They're hiding in the shadows of buildings, Jerma.
[232:38.62]How can we fight this enemy?
[232:40.32]I'm going to blow his arms off.
[232:43.86]Geez.
[232:44.10]You know what the EDF infantry is made of.
[232:46.01]The enemies are attacking us from the side.
[232:52.86]Am I not getting these rockets?
[232:54.09]Are they hitting the mothership?
[232:55.09]Ah, this is an inaccurate fucking thing.
[232:59.11]Like, half the things go through the mothership.
[233:01.35]Alright, I'm coming to you, Toads.
[233:08.27]Thank you so much.
[233:11.96]Oh boy.
[233:17.50]Oh, boy.
[233:18.14]Oh, what the fuck?
[233:20.54]I can't maneuver like this.
[233:25.12]Oh, there was health up there.
[233:29.77]Not anymore.
[233:32.77]My gun isn't doing anything.
[233:34.05]Like, there's nothing about it.
[233:35.23]Okay, what?
[233:36.33]I missed that one, apparently.
[233:37.79]Okay.
[233:39.35]Oh, no wonder.
[233:39.95]We're on all sides right now.
[233:49.15]Okay, this is definitely better, even though I cannot block anything.
[233:52.65]Uh, we, you know, we gotta focus.
[233:54.43]Oh my god.
[233:55.19]We have to focus on one of them at a time, they're regenerating.
[233:58.53]Yeah, the frogs regenerate.
[234:01.45]I picked the wrong time to change classes.
[234:03.43]Holy shit.
[234:04.45]Oh shit.
[234:07.78]I'm not... My gun isn't doing anything.
[234:09.84]Oh, fuck.
[234:10.68]I'm dead.
[234:11.16]Goodbye.
[234:13.54]I will be joining you shortly.
[234:14.72]Yeah, we have to focus.
[234:17.00]We have to focus on one at a time.
[234:18.29]Otherwise, I'm just gonna keep undertakering back up.
[234:21.01]I... My gun stopped doing things.
[234:24.17]I'm gonna get my shotgun back.
[234:27.75]That thing is just too inaccurate for me.
[234:32.99]Are they talking?
[234:35.90]They're...
[234:37.57]That was weird.
[234:38.07]Alright.
[234:46.30]Yeah.
[234:46.42]What if we all played?
[234:48.60]All played.
[234:49.08]Digimon.
[234:50.64]I would do that.
[234:51.98]So I could just sing the theme song over and over again.
[234:55.30]Oh, wait.
[234:55.56]I had a sniper?
[234:56.94]What?
[234:57.62]Oh, my God.
[234:58.06]I'm a dumbass.
[234:59.93]Dummy.
[235:02.35]I'm a big fat dummy.
[235:03.85]I think... What else do I want, though?
[235:05.91]What would be good against those guys?
[235:08.21]Maybe something like this.
[235:09.23]What's the... The thing that just goes... Which one's better?
[235:18.80]Probably Power Lance or Spark.
[235:22.51]Spark, fine.
[235:23.51]Hey, could you do me a favor?
[235:25.62]Can you leave the call and then come back in?
[235:27.72]Me?
[235:28.42]Oh, he's hearing staticky to you too?
[235:30.38]Yes, he is.
[235:31.22]I'm staticky?
[235:32.64]Yeah, you're just static guy.
[235:37.45]Hello?
[235:37.81]I was apologizing.
[235:39.05]Yeah.
[235:40.51]Hello?
[235:40.77]You're still bad.
[235:43.31]How?
[235:44.53]I don't know.
[235:44.89]It's either Discord or... I don't know.
[235:49.73]Yeah, it might be that Discord problem I had.
[235:52.83]you sound normal sir yeah hold on I know the fix for it and because you use uh scarlet solo right yes yeah that caught hold on let me try and remember what the fix is wait a minute wait a minute wait wait am I statically setting on the stream no it would only be on your Discord so go to voice and video settings on Discord yeah on Discord okay
[236:18.47]Scroll down to where it says audio subsystem.
[236:22.06]Audio subsystem?
[236:24.62]Yeah.
[236:25.12]Oh my.
[236:26.66]In the advanced sound options.
[236:29.60]Okay, echo cancellation, noise suppression, automatic gain control, quality of service.
[236:35.87]Lower.
[236:36.61]Lower.
[236:38.49]Audio subsystem is standard.
[236:40.49]Show a warning when... Yeah, set it to legacy.
[236:43.63]Legacy.
[236:45.17]Yeah.
[236:47.76]Okay.
[236:52.97]Alright, hold on.
[236:55.33]What the fuck?
[236:56.25]Am I back?
[236:58.19]Hello?
[236:59.27]Yep.
[236:59.81]How do I sound?
[237:00.15]And you're better.
[237:00.97]I sound better?
[237:01.39]You sound great.
[237:02.13]Crisp as clear as kittens.
[237:04.31]So what the hell was that?
[237:05.60]I don't know.
[237:10.00]That's strange.
[237:10.56]Alright, well.
[237:11.38]But it, yeah, it really be like that sometimes.
[237:13.90]Alright, I think I like my preparation here.
[237:19.34]I'm just gonna fully charge this and drive right into their face.
[237:24.22]I'm going to just drive straight in and just... Did you fix it?
[237:28.24]I think so, I guess.
[237:29.96]Cool.
[237:30.28]When did this start happening?
[237:31.96]Like, 20 minutes ago.
[237:33.16]What the... It, like, slowly got worse and worse.
[237:36.06]It did, yeah.
[237:36.81]I thought it was the same thing as the Talics.
[237:38.95]I thought it was my capture card, so I just ignored it.
[237:41.47]That's odd.
[237:41.75]Yeah, because I have the capture card interference, too.
[237:44.43]It would have been fine on your stream, though, because it's only Discord that happens.
[237:48.69]That's very odd.
[237:49.32]Alright, I'm going to try this again.
[237:57.06]Alright.
[237:58.06]Let's try this again.
[237:58.96]I'm going to try to take damage modifier up.
[238:02.73]What's the range on this thing again?
[238:08.27]So does each one of these stack on me?
[238:09.87]How much damage boost is this?
[238:11.97]I don't know.
[238:12.31]Two or three hits.
[238:13.80]One.
[238:27.26]Alrighty.
[238:28.18]Two.
[238:29.10]That's two hits.
[238:33.81]Oh boy.
[238:34.37]Well, you're flying real low.
[238:36.35]Whoa.
[238:42.31]Oh dear.
[238:45.52]Watch out for the frogs.
[238:52.39]When the game audio gets real quiet and it's just people going... Get me away from this nonsense.
[239:03.49]I'm with tank boy.
[239:04.36]Are you riding on the tank?
[239:07.60]No, I put the damage boost on it, so I'm just following it.
[239:10.04]I got to come back to you guys.
[239:11.06]I'm getting overwhelmed.
[239:13.38]I'm getting overwhelmed.
[239:14.54]I need to come back with the team.
[239:16.04]Ooh, I can do a booster.
[239:17.38]That's pretty cool.
[239:24.07]I haven't like seen anything.
[239:25.33]You just like flew over there in a minute fighting with everything.
[239:27.58]Yeah, it's turned around.
[239:29.28]I'm behind you guys now.
[239:32.28]Drink, drink, drink.
[239:35.06]Oh boy.
[239:35.54]Are you playing a drinking game in chat?
[239:38.36]Did somebody say something?
[239:38.94]Are you playing a drinking game in real life?
[239:43.33]Every time fat takes a drink, we take a drink.
[239:45.49]That's the game?
[239:47.02]Yeah, that's the whole game.
[239:49.78]That sounds good.
[239:50.50]Who's drinking right now?
[239:52.30]Alright, ready?
[239:53.22]Here we go!
[239:55.36]ButtChug.
[239:59.13]Why do I always pick the worst fucking things to read?
[240:01.91]Did you read ButtChug?
[240:02.99]I just read that, I love ya.
[240:05.93]I wrote that.
[240:07.34]I wouldn't be surprised if you did.
[240:09.46]Since then, I don't know, like... You think you're being such a jokester.
[240:13.30]I hate that they say frogs are similar to humans.
[240:21.31]They are, though.
[240:22.21]You know that frogs... They stand up on two feet.
[240:24.15]That's the only enemy so far that only has two feet.
[240:26.77]And they regenerate, and they are giant, and they're frogs.
[240:29.65]Wait, but you guys... Hold on.
[240:30.63]You guys actually don't know that.
[240:31.57]He said almost identical to humans.
[240:33.83]You guys don't know that.
[240:34.69]Frog DNA is actually, like, genetically, like, the genome is as close to humans as anything else.
[240:39.88]Say, Geno.
[240:41.60]Oh, Geno!
[240:41.92]You know what?
[240:45.96]You're not wrong.
[240:47.58]Yes.
[240:48.22]Frogs are genetically as close as possible to humans, almost identical.
[240:51.66]Something's approaching!
[240:54.73]It's...
[240:55.27]Yeah, we're growing in batch just like those.
[240:57.71]I'm just as slimy as them.
[241:01.28]That's because I don't shower.
[241:03.20]I got an idea.
[241:06.38]What are those?
[241:07.20]I love that.
[241:08.92]My idea is stand directly next to one of the canisters.
[241:11.75]All three of us.
[241:12.31]My idea is just get the F out of here, you know what I mean?
[241:15.71]And wait till they spawn and then...
[241:20.98]Hey Jerma, peek your head out.
[241:22.30]I want to see you.
[241:23.60]I got you.
[241:24.46]I want to see you.
[241:26.06]Here we go.
[241:28.10]Gotcha.
[241:30.22]I don't think we're supposed to defend from this, like, open, no-cover courtyard where they come from all sides.
[241:35.94]Oh, he was like, that guy didn't even know he got shot in the head.
[241:38.40]He just was like, I'm ready to go!
[241:39.52]Did I just break Discord again?
[241:46.90]oh my god wait was I thinking that my gun last round was a mortar but I had the sniper I think my brain broke last round it's okay I switched guns and I'm also actually killing things now too so alright do we have to how much of their body has to be destroyed is this like um oh geez man Dragon Ball z reference no it's a like a zombie reference they have to destroy their head or I don't get it the whole body I'm dead
[242:17.51]Are they aliens?
[242:18.65]They look like humans.
[242:19.97]Come on.
[242:21.63]It looks like grandma.
[242:22.69]Just like humans.
[242:24.49]They look just like, come on.
[242:28.77]They have mouths, too.
[242:30.35]They have mouths.
[242:33.27]So they have their own language, just like humans?
[242:38.03]Alright, I will come rescue you eventually.
[242:40.35]Oh, we have permission to attack them.
[242:47.93]What do you mean you have permission to attack them?
[242:49.27]They've been here for two, three straight minutes on the ground.
[242:52.04]They say we have permission.
[242:53.42]They're both alive?
[242:59.06]I expect a full recovery here.
[243:01.16]Look, I'm coming.
[243:02.88]I even jumped over the heel.
[243:04.20]Nice.
[243:04.68]I blew off one's wiener.
[243:05.92]I actually got both of them from airborne position.
[243:07.76]Funny, funny, funny.
[243:10.54]Oh yeah, it like lost its leg.
[243:11.58]I got a trophy for that.
[243:12.99]Thank you.
[243:13.47]I was looking for that one.
[243:20.86]What the fuck was that backflip?
[243:22.40]Excuse me, sir.
[243:23.10]Just need to move your leg out of the way.
[243:29.14]That's a pretty good fight between me and this guy.
[243:30.87]Uh-oh, uh-oh, but he's still alive.
[243:33.27]Oh, I powered him up by accident.
[243:38.95]That guy's still alive.
[243:39.99]Oh, goddammit.
[243:40.77]Really?
[243:40.91]Alright, I gotta get some collection.
[243:47.52]Is this one dead?
[243:48.04]No.
[243:49.74]The one that we were just shooting like five minutes ago is still alive.
[243:57.92]They're firing at us!
[243:58.62]Crossfire!
[243:58.86]Any others?
[243:59.82]Don't get caught up in the crossfire.
[244:02.06]Guys, these guys look like bullet people.
[244:03.40]You're caught up now!
[244:05.36]Crossfire!
[244:06.00]Got him.
[244:07.06]Crossfire!
[244:08.68]Crossfire!
[244:10.24]Yeah!
[244:10.91]Yeah!
[244:11.77]Wow.
[244:12.59]This really is like... Dude, they know techniques.
[244:17.62]That is a um... You know they still sell Crossfire in Target.
[244:21.87]Do they actually?
[244:23.37]Yep.
[244:24.33]Why have they never... has there ever been a commercial for it?
[244:28.41]I don't know.
[244:30.89]One of those old boomer games that they still sell.
[244:35.51]Like Monopoly.
[244:40.68]Oh shit!
[244:41.81]I ran out of firepower.
[244:42.65]Alright, got him.
[244:45.72]Shut up, guys!
[244:46.96]They're just like humans!
[244:55.36]They're regenerated!
[244:58.42]So do we have to... Is it time for the mothership, or what?
[245:09.42]I'm waiting for this to open.
[245:11.30]They said ignore the mothership.
[245:13.12]Well, here's more of these.
[245:14.17]Oh, God.
[245:14.63]Okay.
[245:15.47]Don't know what I'm supposed to be looking at, but that's cool.
[245:17.49]It's more of those frogs.
[245:20.03]Oh, shit.
[245:20.59]No wonder my head was hurting.
[245:21.97]Like, all this yelling.
[245:23.12]Alright, we need to focus, because we need to focus on these.
[245:27.34]Which canister were we going after first?
[245:31.16]I don't know.
[245:32.04]There's so many.
[245:33.44]Oh my god.
[245:33.96]Who knows you choose.
[245:35.60]I don't know Alright one leader over here with you guys.
[245:39.50]We need to do that one later One layer Stop waiting for orders the ones in front of us What okay, okay, we do it we did it oh
[246:01.45]Good job.
[246:05.03]Good.
[246:06.59]Nice work.
[246:10.15]Grenades and support equipment, okay.
[246:14.35]Dragon, that's getting better.
[246:15.61]I like I'm not getting anything new anymore.
[246:24.61]Now that's a victory.
[246:28.25]Oh, it's you!
[246:29.47]It's really good to see you in one piece.
[246:31.72]Yeah, the minigun was doing well.
[246:33.76]I kind of can't take this thing off, but this thing got better.
[246:35.89]Yeah, I'll try it again.
[246:37.07]Power lands.
[246:40.55]What is my new gun?
[246:42.97]The Galleon.
[246:45.75]I haven't tried this yet.
[246:46.58]I'm going to give it a go.
[246:49.42]Oh, I never summoned my... Capacity, 19.
[247:00.38]What version of Fortnite is this?
[247:03.88]Season 7.
[247:04.64]It's a good version.
[247:09.36]Dude, did you see the Storm King?
[247:12.00]No.
[247:12.28]Do you play Fortnite?
[247:13.06]Didn't you play Fortnite for a little while?
[247:15.43]I played Save the World when that's all there was.
[247:19.61]So why didn't you... What type of enemies?
[247:23.91]Probably frogs.
[247:25.99]Frogs.
[247:26.95]I would assume it's probably frogs because we just got overwhelmed by frogs.
[247:30.47]okay yeah I think it's frogs then I won't pick sword guy uh but yeah if so did you ever play any of the battle royale for Fortnite I played like one day when it the first day it came out I played first impression oh what was my first impression
[248:01.98]Yeah, what's your first impression?
[248:04.48]First impression was that the random bullet spread was way too extreme, and I quit because of that, and then they fixed it three days later, and I never played it again anyway.
[248:13.50]Okay.
[248:14.10]Okay.
[248:14.50]They fixed it three days later.
[248:16.28]Oh, okay.
[248:16.44]Wait, I zoomed out.
[248:17.36]They're, like, roaming as if they don't know we're here, so we... I think it's assuming that we're going to, like... This guy's still fucking alive!
[248:26.47]He's still alive!
[248:29.63]This guy's still talking.
[248:31.54]Oh, is this guy still living?
[248:33.90]Okay, we need to stick together.
[248:35.12]What is this?
[248:36.81]Left 4 Dead?
[248:37.13]So when Jerma flies away and does his own thing?
[248:39.71]Dude.
[248:41.27]Well, I can actually keep up with you guys now.
[248:43.25]Alright.
[248:44.05]Because I have two boosts instead of one.
[248:45.25]So who do you want to go after?
[248:45.87]Behind us, down the road.
[248:46.93]Down the road behind us?
[248:48.97]I do see a frog.
[248:49.67]They're roaming.
[248:52.17]There's one actually behind us.
[248:54.32]Yes, there actually is one behind us.
[248:55.86]There is actually one behind us.
[248:58.98]He's dodging.
[249:00.89]A lot, actually.
[249:03.53]To our right.
[249:07.05]Oh my god, the inaccuracy.
[249:08.85]The inaccuracy.
[249:15.43]That's the pinpoint accuracy I want.
[249:19.48]This thing's actually really good.
[249:24.84]Dude, they're just like humans.
[249:30.33]Well, I feel like I'm killing people when I kill them.
[249:32.47]That's gonna leave me with some severe PTSD.
[249:37.36]Oh fuck, there's too many here.
[249:38.30]What am I doing over here by myself?
[249:40.38]I cannot dehumanize this enemy.
[249:43.86]I'm going back to you guys.
[249:47.60]Class dismissed.
[249:50.74]I just need to get my mechs so that I can be a big human.
[249:54.64]Then you'll look just like them even more.
[249:56.84]Yeah.
[249:57.12]Alright, let's pick up some of this shit.
[249:58.67]What do you say?
[250:02.61]Go for headshots.
[250:04.63]Really?
[250:04.99]Mm-hmm.
[250:06.43]Yes.
[250:06.85]Because they're just like humans?
[250:07.73]Is that why?
[250:08.43]That's what I've been told.
[250:10.59]They are zombies.
[250:12.45]Ooh, I'm pretty good at those headshots.
[250:17.45]Well, his head does come off, and I don't think they can regenerate that.
[250:19.95]Oh, my God.
[250:20.25]There's one right behind me.
[250:22.34]What the?
[250:27.00]Just watching the giant frogman collapse is pretty humorous.
[250:38.38]Ooh, dodge.
[250:40.54]Good dodge, man.
[250:42.88]Uh-oh.
[250:45.76]Out of power.
[250:49.80]Uh, any more boxes that I missed anywhere?
[250:56.82]Maybe back here?
[250:58.06]I don't think I've seen a single one.
[251:06.85]Why is this one, like, easier than the last one?
[251:08.79]Yeah, it really is.
[251:10.77]Because they don't spawn in a circle around us, all aware of us, maybe?
[251:21.01]True.
[251:23.95]Headshot.
[251:25.00]Headshot.
[251:26.44]You're standing right next to him.
[251:29.50]Okay.
[251:29.90]Never mind.
[251:32.55]What do I do?
[251:33.29]There's a big health box right behind you.
[251:37.00]If you want it.
[251:37.84]I got full health.
[251:40.12]Who am I next to?
[251:41.06]Star.
[251:42.40]No, I'm next to an NPC that is just you.
[251:45.78]But without your name.
[251:48.48]You were like really good at Fortnite, weren't you?
[251:51.41]Who are you talking to?
[251:53.15]What are you saying?
[251:55.03]Oh, I forgot I was the stupid Grenader.
[251:56.57]Listen, who's the last person in this call to play PUBG?
[251:59.17]It's probably Star.
[252:00.50]No, it's you.
[252:01.60]Probably.
[252:14.81]But are we counting PUBG on mobile?
[252:17.48]Yeah, because is that not also called PUBG?
[252:19.56]I mean, that's the first part of the title.
[252:22.54]The second part is mobile.
[252:24.86]Why did you play PUBG on mobile?
[252:26.94]I don't know.
[252:27.82]Why does anybody do anything?
[252:30.36]Bored and I wanted to try it.
[252:33.49]That was a well-timed stream.
[252:36.89]Oh, they chant because they're close.
[252:40.68]That was worth it right there.
[252:41.72]Bingo.
[252:42.50]Get all three of them.
[252:44.46]Oh, man.
[252:45.54]I could smell it from here.
[252:46.56]They're not singing anymore.
[252:49.90]They were screaming, but they're not singing with me.
[252:53.48]Oh, there they go.
[252:54.82]I just... Come on.
[252:55.34]Blow the guy's head off.
[252:56.16]These are like... This is like one of the strongest... This is the strongest thing I have.
[252:59.72]Why is that guy floating around?
[253:04.92]Alright, fuck it.
[253:12.38]Wow, that guy's dead.
[253:13.52]I saw that.
[253:16.44]So do you get to choose what your mech weapon loadout is?
[253:18.63]Uh, there's different mechs.
[253:20.97]Oh.
[253:21.53]Can I land on your head?
[253:25.49]Oh, fuck!
[253:26.99]What?
[253:28.59]That just scared the shit out of me.
[253:31.13]I think you're gonna slide off.
[253:32.49]Yeah.
[253:37.04]You can fly so much longer than me, mommy mech.
[253:41.71]I'm going down this side street.
[253:43.07]It's not worth it.
[253:49.22]I'm gonna die.
[253:52.78]I'm gonna go check for health.
[253:53.52]Ooh, found an enemy, finally!
[253:54.90]Yeah, I'm doing more, like, walking around this thing than anything.
[254:01.15]Yeah.
[254:01.29]Health, health.
[254:03.07]There we go.
[254:09.38]I keep accidentally touching the touchpad.
[254:13.53]The touchscreen?
[254:15.31]And they, like, run away and hide.
[254:17.13]I don't have the time to go over there.
[254:18.91]No.
[254:19.59]Don't worry.
[254:24.57]I got it.
[254:24.93]Whoops.
[254:26.61]My finger hurts.
[254:27.71]There's one more guy down here.
[254:29.09]Getting cramps, too.
[254:31.47]I feel like my guy's so slow and floaty that if I just push the thumbsticks hard, it'll go faster.
[254:35.96]Look at how far away these last two are.
[254:39.37]Well, I'll see you guys when the end of the mission happens.
[254:42.57]I'm going to hit him from here.
[254:44.05]I think you're the fastest one, aren't you?
[254:46.35]Yeah, I'll be there in like two seconds.
[254:51.35]Touching the touchpad is what... Yeah, the touchpad makes it go... Emote!
[254:55.93]You do a random emote.
[254:59.19]There's actually a lot down here.
[255:00.53]I probably can't do this by myself.
[255:04.63]Well, I may as well play with the civilians.
[255:12.19]I'm getting there.
[255:22.16]My stream is jazz plus.
[255:24.34]Help me, help me, EDF, EDF.
[255:26.24]Help me.
[255:34.12]You're going to finish it by the time I get there.
[255:35.66]No, I'm not.
[255:36.42]I'm not.
[255:37.40]I'm not.
[255:39.86]I'm not taking this on!
[255:41.78]I'm not!
[255:42.52]I'm dead.
[255:44.98]Every time I say thanks.
[255:46.56]I think they emoted you.
[255:47.93]No, I hit the emote accidentally.
[255:52.81]I think like after they killed you they emote taunted you.
[255:59.79]This is like the perfect gun for killing them.
[256:02.22]Nothing like a good siege gun.
[256:08.89]I was flying into the screen.
[256:11.39]That guy with no arms rolled backwards looks so cute.
[256:16.55]Hey, I finally made it to you.
[256:18.83]Pick me up.
[256:19.14]Pick me up before it's over so I can pick up all the stuff.
[256:21.46]Come on.
[256:22.22]I'm coming.
[256:23.12]Gee.
[256:24.14]There's really not much stuff here, is there?
[256:32.06]That was not a fart.
[256:34.12]I would... Okay.
[256:36.59]Ooh, big plasma cannon got leveled up.
[256:38.15]Nice.
[256:39.47]Ooh!
[256:41.03]A dash cell.
[256:42.92]How much?
[256:45.82]I'm not farting.
[256:49.64]Pretty decent damage upgrade.
[256:51.00]I'll keep it on.
[256:54.44]A little plasma fall.
[256:55.64]More frogs.
[256:58.40]More frogs, of course.
[256:59.84]Ready.
[257:01.00]I want a helicopter already, man.
[257:03.58]Maybe we can go back and do a hard mission.
[257:06.64]Yeah, we could.
[257:11.02]Should I do that?
[257:12.40]Um, can I pee after this mission or before the mission?
[257:15.50]Go pee right now because Etalyx takes like 20 minutes to pick what he wants.
[257:18.42]Alright, I'm peeing.
[257:18.96]I'll be right back.
[257:20.96]I'm gonna put him on a hard mission.
[257:22.10]I like to have fun and I switch my weapons sometimes.
[257:24.52]Peeing.
[257:29.53]That was a quick, easy one.
[257:30.79]This was a nice one.
[257:32.37]Also, I don't understand the difference between booster and thruster enhancer.
[257:39.82]this one okay blood storm I'm gonna use blood storm we're gonna fight a bunch of ants okay okay hard difficulty ants and red ants well then this is probably not a good weapon
[258:09.57]um the swords actually might make sense here then which if that's the case then I would want the dash cell okay I'm also gonna pee because I'm ready you can start whenever you want
[258:37.56]Maybe I should pee and be the last one to come back.
[258:44.21]Maybe I should be the last one to pee and the last one to come back.
[259:16.38]so so
[259:54.44]Alright.
[259:56.14]How we doing?
[259:56.52]Is anybody here?
[260:02.85]Well, looks like it's just me.
[260:16.02]They all left.
[260:17.22]Hi.
[260:18.66]No, no, I'm here.
[260:19.88]Oh.
[260:20.24]I was the last one to leave, and Etalyx is taking a poop.
[260:23.46]He must be.
[260:28.86]yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna go go to the bathroom I'm gonna go to number two we'll be back in 45 minutes yeah can you can go check on him like just stand outside the door and like knock and ask if it's okay what am I potty training him no smell under the door to see if you really want to go oh my god you are revolting you are revolting
[260:55.77]Oh, everything about that was so vivid and, and descript.
[261:05.22]Oh, God.
[261:09.37]Well, I'm not the one who's, uh,
[261:14.79]Not showing up.
[261:15.37]He told me I could start whenever I wanted to, but we're doing a hard mission, Jeremy, with ants.
[261:19.78]Hard ants.
[261:20.56]We're doing the mountain ravine mission with the ants that came down the hill.
[261:25.28]Oh, are you really?
[261:25.82]On hard.
[261:26.92]On hard.
[261:27.68]Okay, okay, okay.
[261:28.56]Do you have the correct equipment?
[261:31.18]I'm going to put on the plasma fall then, because that's really probably pretty good here.
[261:35.04]Can I get a high five?
[261:37.30]Keep that.
[261:37.96]Three, two, one.
[261:40.90]Nice.
[261:41.10]Okay, we did it.
[261:43.89]Alright.
[261:52.22]One, two, three.
[261:53.18]Alright, ready to high five?
[261:57.94]High five and ready?
[261:58.82]One, two, three, high five.
[262:01.90]That bit me in the mouth!
[262:03.12]What the fuck?
[262:06.03]Ow!
[262:06.41]Can you stop saying that?
[262:07.69]You're so vivid and descript.
[262:10.83]People are just all imagining violence, domestic violence.
[262:14.81]Someone's calling the cops.
[262:21.68]so vivid and descript he's the vivid and descript one he's out of his mind Etalyx is back he just said help me in chat perfect timing alright this one's hard was not the perfect timing oh perfect timing what's the perfect timing like 10 minutes ago you're really gonna go do a number two while we're all streaming
[262:51.28]That would have been the fastest number two in my entire life if that was the case.
[262:55.32]Watch what I can do.
[262:58.66]Dude, it's hard.
[262:59.20]Come on.
[262:59.46]Don't kill all our guys.
[263:00.54]Oh, whoops.
[263:01.40]Okay.
[263:03.00]Okay, I'll try.
[263:04.62]And remember to pick up weapon boxes.
[263:06.56]I am going to be on it.
[263:08.12]I'm going to stay with you guys, though, because I don't want... How come you don't have the star colors?
[263:13.95]What?
[263:14.87]I'm in this color so you can notice me.
[263:16.51]Etalyx, how come you're not in your channel colors?
[263:19.76]What are you talking about?
[263:20.66]Why are you not your channel?
[263:21.98]You're not your channel colors.
[263:26.36]Your guy.
[263:26.94]Why are you like aqua blue?
[263:28.48]Because that's my channel colors.
[263:29.84]What?
[263:30.04]I can't believe you guys didn't do that.
[263:32.83]You're like a green.
[263:33.71]No, I'm not.
[263:35.01]Have you even seen me?
[263:36.95]Have you even seen my channel?
[263:40.21]So what?
[263:42.25]You already are like my color.
[263:43.66]You're supposed to be like a purple fuchsia, but you're like a hot pink.
[263:48.07]the whole game.
[263:48.59]I don't think you've ever even seen this channel.
[263:51.01]I see it right, it's all, you've got the logo on the Discord.
[263:54.01]I can see it right here.
[263:54.87]What are you talking about?
[263:56.59]Look at the, look at mine, look at yours.
[263:58.11]Oh, I just fell in.
[263:59.15]It's brighter pink than yours.
[264:01.77]This domestic violence is just... I need help.
[264:04.91]It's unbecoming of you.
[264:06.07]Help, help, help, help.
[264:06.93]I'll nuke you, I'll nuke you, I'll nuke you.
[264:09.45]Give me the cabinet, give me the cabinet, give me the cabinet.
[264:15.20]I'm sword guy now, it's pretty fun.
[264:18.85]Well, it was until I died because of the nuke.
[264:23.43]I'm sending another one.
[264:24.89]Why are you doing this again?
[264:27.36]Let me get him.
[264:28.08]Can you just pick up the boxes?
[264:29.78]I'm trying to get Etalyx because he's dead.
[264:31.70]And now you're dropping another nuke on us.
[264:33.40]And this is going to be your fault when he dies again in five seconds.
[264:36.94]How is he going to die again from that?
[264:39.62]Can you help me instead?
[264:41.16]No.
[264:42.45]Help you by helping us.
[264:43.61]Stop nuking me!
[264:45.27]What the fuck?
[264:46.85]What game are you playing?
[264:47.91]Are you playing, like, trying to kill your friends?
[264:49.51]I'm killing the ants!
[264:53.37]Check these ant kills on me, bud.
[264:58.16]Come on, I'm picking up boxes.
[264:59.46]Relax.
[264:59.80]Attention, everyone.
[265:04.72]This is the Chief Commander.
[265:08.14]There's so many, there's so many bombs being dropped.
[265:10.90]I got, I'm, they caught me.
[265:11.90]I can't even see.
[265:27.19]I'm dead.
[265:28.03]You're just dropping nukes in this tiny hallway.
[265:33.69]I don't see how this is my fault.
[265:36.52]I have gold damage right now.
[265:38.08]That's right.
[265:39.70]That is absolutely right.
[265:42.86]Did you pick up any boxes?
[265:44.28]I got, like, two.
[265:46.12]Okay, well, if the Etalyx doesn't screw this up... What am I doing?
[265:52.51]Oh, you're all dead.
[265:54.55]I'm the one that's going to screw this up?
[265:57.14]Because he doesn't tell us when he's going to drop a nuke.
[266:02.26]We just see the red telegraph Warcraft boss.
[266:05.30]The Wildstar boss, sorry.
[266:07.86]What?
[266:08.78]Like the red telegraph on the ground.
[266:10.30]I physically cannot kill this ant.
[266:13.91]If you keep... The longer you stay alive, the longer I have to look at this guy's fanny.
[266:18.79]Alright, well...
[266:20.19]I'm trying to come to you, but I only... I'm just a little guy!
[266:23.09]I have boosters!
[266:23.81]This is just... such a joke.
[266:25.13]Well, it was fun.
[266:25.71]I think we may have gotten a weapon.
[266:27.71]We got a weapon.
[266:28.19]Yep.
[266:28.27]Let's retreat.
[266:29.31]Yes.
[266:49.13]Ooh, ooh, that's new!
[266:50.93]Let me say my meme.
[266:52.19]Hawaiian.
[266:52.79]That's my meme.
[266:53.37]Homing weapons.
[266:54.34]Geist.
[266:54.54]What?
[266:54.86]Wait, it said I got three weapons, but I only got one.
[266:58.02]Hey, I got one weapon.
[266:59.64]I got a new weapon.
[267:00.58]Didn't it just say three?
[267:03.72]Uh, but we didn't win, so I picked up three boxes.
[267:07.36]But we lost.
[267:07.90]Uh, that looks cool.
[267:09.80]Does it split between us things?
[267:14.34]Uh, I don't know.
[267:15.18]I could be the jackhammer.
[267:16.16]There's level six?
[267:17.23]Holy crap.
[267:18.53]Try this.
[267:18.89]Okay, we're doing the mission again.
[267:20.03]Ready up.
[267:21.37]Okay, I just got to change from force blades because they suck.
[267:25.83]And I want to be very clear.
[267:27.21]It's three split between you all.
[267:33.91]Is this EDF any good?
[267:38.62]Here's what we're doing.
[267:39.20]Are you asking us?
[267:40.04]I mean, that's what people just want to know.
[267:41.58]What do you think?
[267:43.10]This EDF is good.
[267:44.04]It's EDF.
[267:44.66]They're all the same game.
[267:47.40]What's new in this one versus EDF 4.1?
[267:50.26]It's on PlayStation 4 only.
[267:52.37]That's true.
[267:52.83]Yeah, that's what's new.
[267:54.03]It's not on PC anymore.
[267:57.35]Guys, listen.
[267:59.39]Come with me down to the other side of the river, and then when all the ants come down the hill and fight these scumbags, I'm going to bomb them.
[268:05.93]The scumbags.
[268:08.37]Can you please come with me?
[268:11.00]You just took off 30% of my health.
[268:15.10]Okay, I hit you one time.
[268:18.02]I didn't mean to.
[268:18.78]Okay, we're going to hide behind these rocks.
[268:24.84]Sure.
[268:26.46]And when they come down there, they're going to be the ones complaining.
[268:31.89]Oh, can you stop with the dildozer?
[268:34.79]That's a great name, by the way.
[268:37.81]What did you just call this?
[268:39.97]Hey.
[268:40.11]Sir?
[268:41.35]What were you gonna do?
[268:42.95]You ordered me, right?
[268:44.23]I'm here to please.
[268:45.21]I think this is so slow moving, but I wonder how much damage it does.
[268:50.67]Oh, boy.
[268:51.29]This is actually... This is... I'm dead.
[268:53.80]Help.
[268:54.30]Turn around.
[268:55.04]Did you... Are you out?
[269:03.98]No.
[269:04.32]I've shot it like three times.
[269:08.21]If I shoot this again... Can the guy with the jetpack not get grabbed next time?
[269:12.35]You told me to stand behind.
[269:16.16]You didn't say anything.
[269:16.90]You said, stay behind here and let me do this.
[269:18.96]And now I got thrown across the whole map.
[269:24.10]Okay, so if I just never switch off of the Jack... Well, it's called the jackhammer, so I mean the... Okay, stay back here.
[269:30.91]Stay behind here.
[269:31.83]Don't come... Wait, stay back here.
[269:33.53]You have a mini-map that tells you the location of all enemies, but it's my fault.
[269:36.57]Stand behind this rock.
[269:37.53]No, no, let everyone stand by me now.
[269:40.41]Thinks he's some kind of fucking quarterback.
[269:46.10]Oh, my hands are so... big.
[269:55.52]Don't worry, I will get to you eventually.
[270:00.47]Why is this not on there?
[270:03.23]Thank you.
[270:06.17]I can't, this weapon's physically impossible to see anything.
[270:09.62]Hope nobody here has epilepsy.
[270:14.16]Why were you standing behind the quarterback?
[270:15.74]What are you talking about?
[270:27.12]I need help.
[270:27.56]Uh-oh.
[270:27.96]You need help now, don't you?
[270:31.44]Where are all these... How many... How is that thing still alive?
[270:38.76]That thing takes so long to recharge.
[270:40.90]No one can pick me up while I have this equipped at all.
[270:43.72]It's pretty strong.
[271:10.38]Leave me alone, bugs.
[271:11.24]Alright, I'm gonna try to get some stuff.
[271:13.80]There's a shitload of things down there.
[271:16.67]uh wait till everything's dead because I'm I gotta keep summoning these otherwise we're never gonna kill everything just defend your quarterback this is an emergency news flash edf just made a major announcement okay now I now now start getting the I'm not gonna do any more after this one okay on the Earth's orbit and the edf has started battling with aliens
[271:43.55]I'm trying to help you.
[271:44.43]They got me.
[271:44.95]And if I shoot it, I'm dead, so whatever.
[271:47.00]I'm coming.
[272:01.98]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[272:04.49]You muted this guy, dude.
[272:06.33]I know.
[272:07.45]Der is dead.
[272:08.27]I'm dead.
[272:09.33]Only left is Germobot.
[272:11.57]We're all dead.
[272:12.45]I'm coming.
[272:12.77]This is not a promotion for a film or a TV show.
[272:15.43]This is not a promotion for a film or a TV show.
[272:21.86]This is not a TV show.
[272:24.04]How far can these reach?
[272:29.76]Pretty far, apparently, actually.
[272:31.80]Man, I should have summoned my mechs a long time ago.
[272:37.14]Yeah, probably.
[272:37.88]Isn't that your specialty?
[272:38.72]I keep forgetting I have them.
[272:40.64]Is that it?
[272:41.05]I just have them bombs all the time.
[272:43.59]Is there anything else?
[272:44.47]Is that the end of it?
[272:46.95]I thought there was another way.
[272:48.47]That's it.
[272:49.27]Yeah.
[272:51.87]That's a good farm.
[272:53.39]Pretty good farm level.
[272:54.75]Alien ant farm, you guys like that band?
[272:57.82]Wow, I got level zero items from that hard mission.
[273:04.58]That was really, that was good.
[273:06.14]I got some really great new shit.
[273:09.16]I did not.
[273:10.47]Sparkvine.
[273:10.89]I got better stuff for Rainer.
[273:14.19]Almost my first level eight, guys.
[273:16.21]I'm so excited.
[273:20.91]Okay.
[273:21.61]Last we can in B. This might be too high, though.
[273:24.93]A little six.
[273:27.72]Well, let's do that one more time.
[273:29.62]Rapid Mirage.
[273:31.82]I didn't get anything.
[273:33.72]And then the Vibro Hammer.
[273:37.91]I didn't get anything.
[273:44.05]So, I can use Rapid Mirage.
[273:45.41]That's a lot of rockets.
[273:52.08]Oh, I can use this too.
[273:53.08]Both of them, and they're both really good.
[273:54.32]15 targets.
[273:56.40]Very cool.
[273:56.84]Let's try it.
[274:01.61]Watch your back this time.
[274:07.41]As you level up, you get to wear less armor?
[274:11.21]I don't think so, no.
[274:11.85]I think it's just... You pick up those armor boxes, and that's how you permanently increase your armor and HP.
[274:19.10]Or, well, your armor.
[274:23.96]My character looks like a toothpaste Max Scott.
[274:36.54]Don't let them drag you down.
[274:44.62]This is a double dentist, is it?
[274:48.18]I'm looking forward to this, then.
[274:54.70]rapid mirage oh I actually did the next mission this mission sucks because after you beat that one it does one forward even though you already have that unlocked what are we doing what do you what happened to you that was the wrong mission oh okay that homing rapid fire thing seems pretty cool although it took a while to kill one ant though
[275:18.38]That's really good on the flying swasses.
[275:20.76]Yeah.
[275:22.14]I did get a better Plasma Cannon, though.
[275:23.40]Plasma Cannon B. Level 6.
[275:26.54]Oh, yeah.
[275:26.96]Tell me more.
[275:28.26]It's a level 6.
[275:29.98]It's got a radius of 20 meters.
[275:34.50]Alright, I'm not doing this now.
[275:36.22]I'm not doing this anymore.
[275:37.18]Okay, remember, stay behind.
[275:39.44]We gotta get ahead of these losers.
[275:41.32]Stay behind me.
[275:44.40]Oh, I have no movement with this.
[275:45.52]And remember to look at your mini-map and know if there's an ant right behind you.
[275:48.48]I can fight no more.
[275:52.08]Okay.
[275:52.54]Shush.
[275:53.08]I think I heard something.
[275:58.63]Shush.
[275:58.83]Come on.
[276:03.17]Alien ant farm.
[276:04.13]This place is insane.
[276:07.15]More dangerous than before.
[276:14.13]I had another window on the window a crescendo Dude a crescendo on the window.
[276:21.35]Oh boy.
[276:23.14]Let's try it out Well, how long does this take to lock on is this anti air Is this anti air farm?
[276:34.98]Is this only
[276:36.70]Alright, I have not used this at all, so I'm kind of aiming in the complete wrong direction.
[276:40.25]Watch out, there's one on us.
[276:41.61]Hey, what happened?
[276:42.19]Can you guys see anything on my character?
[276:43.51]Oh boy.
[276:43.77]Don't worry, I'll punch him in the face.
[276:50.64]Sir, can you look at me when I hold this button and see if there's like a way to assist me with it?
[276:54.74]A way to assist you?
[276:57.22]Do you see anything?
[276:59.00]Right now?
[277:01.10]No.
[277:01.44]I cannot fire this weapon.
[277:04.05]I need a beacon or laser target from an air raider.
[277:06.73]Oh, yeah, I have to equip that.
[277:09.11]Okay, I didn't realize that that was what that was.
[277:12.67]But I now have a weapon that is compatible with it.
[277:20.06]This thing looks really cool.
[277:21.18]Punch boy.
[277:21.72]Fuck, man, it drains me.
[277:24.72]Alright, watch that.
[277:25.50]Watch the sides.
[277:27.36]Both sides.
[277:27.68]Stay together.
[277:28.06]Why are you guys going up into the river?
[277:30.36]Into the river.
[277:32.46]It is a river.
[277:38.11]Star!
[277:40.19]Thank you, Ant, for saving my life.
[277:51.04]How is this thing still alive?
[277:54.27]I've shot this thing point blank seven or eight times.
[278:04.27]Are you dead?
[278:04.79]I'm dead.
[278:06.11]Oh.
[278:06.67]Where are you?
[278:07.63]Up the mountain.
[278:09.55]I'm so far.
[278:10.74]He threw me.
[278:11.38]You're way up there.
[278:12.28]He threw me as far as he fucking could.
[278:16.66]No one listens to sir making the calls.
[278:18.84]What was the call?
[278:19.50]You died.
[278:19.90]Why'd you die?
[278:21.32]We did the same thing that we did last time.
[278:24.46]And you guys went forward into the shithole.
[278:27.45]Don't blame me.
[278:29.27]How can I not blame you?
[278:30.55]Because I'm only this far forward to try.
[278:32.29]I was going to try to go up the mountain to resurrect.
[278:34.35]I got grabbed by Buck, and he ran away, and he threw me.
[278:40.21]Hey, why don't you relax, buddy?
[278:42.75]No, I can't relax.
[278:45.78]I physically don't think I can get up the mountain.
[278:48.82]I don't think you can either.
[278:51.30]Wait, maybe you can.
[278:52.10]I only have a dash.
[278:52.86]I have no airborne abilities.
[278:54.28]I can see you trying.
[278:56.59]I'm trying my darndest here.
[278:58.23]Hang on.
[279:01.45]There we go.
[279:02.05]I'm getting closer.
[279:03.56]Don't worry.
[279:04.40]Talc is going to MVP this right now.
[279:08.92]Hi.
[279:09.24]Hi.
[279:10.24]Oh.
[279:11.24]Okay.
[279:11.58]I'm actually well equipped for this scenario.
[279:15.62]He threw me down the mountain.
[279:18.26]Oh, God damn it.
[279:19.00]This really is like World of Warcraft mountain climbing.
[279:32.41]I'm just barely faster than them.
[279:37.13]Oh, you're getting collapsed on.
[279:39.29]They're all over here.
[279:42.73]Uh-oh.
[279:46.92]Are you gonna get thrown down again, aren't you?
[279:50.22]Hey, I mean, I'm not on top of a mountain.
[279:51.96]You could get me.
[279:53.80]If I fall down again, then I will.
[279:55.56]Oh, my God.
[280:00.60]Yeah, the red ants are the fucking worst.
[280:04.12]I'm almost there!
[280:05.88]I was!
[280:06.30]Did I get you?
[280:20.51]No, you just, like, skied by me.
[280:22.07]Oh, come on!
[280:25.16]No, I didn't mean that, thanks.
[280:26.88]That button just hits it every time when I accidentally... Oh, fuck!
[280:33.78]Get the fuck away from me!
[280:35.08]Okay, I'm coming for you, Star.
[280:36.75]I'm coming.
[280:45.77]Oh, no.
[280:48.07]Oh, no.
[280:48.61]Don't ragdoll into the way.
[280:55.36]I'm somehow still pulling this off.
[280:59.72]I cannot be caught.
[281:03.56]Get the fuck away from me.
[281:12.59]Watch the left.
[281:18.27]Are you dying, Dremel?
[281:19.39]No, I'm fine.
[281:20.11]I'm staying back.
[281:20.69]You guys okay?
[281:21.27]You back?
[281:21.73]Alright, I'm gonna go flex.
[281:23.29]Mission saved.
[281:25.41]No, not yet.
[281:26.37]Alright, I'm going for it.
[281:29.15]Yeah, these are the last bugs.
[281:31.28]We need all the boxes.
[281:32.70]Yeah, try not to kill these last two.
[281:35.10]Oh, they're dead.
[281:38.98]There's a box right there.
[281:40.48]Well done.
[281:41.59]Well done, hey.
[281:42.21]Well done.
[281:44.59]They don't taste so salty.
[281:52.72]If I didn't have double dash, that would not have been possible.
[281:55.24]And also, the fist gun you made fun of me for is what won the mission.
[281:59.76]See?
[281:59.84]I didn't make fun of you.
[282:01.94]You called it a dildozer.
[282:04.28]I am going to blame you because I am going to blame you all for... That's all I heard.
[282:11.25]I mean, if you're going to act like that, then we're doing the mission again.
[282:19.67]A splasher?
[282:20.43]What is a splasher?
[282:26.85]Was I supposed to pretend he punched me again?
[282:28.80]Sorry.
[282:30.16]I wasn't paying attention.
[282:33.24]Let's see.
[282:34.68]Well done, guys.
[282:35.66]Well done.
[282:37.72]Yeah.
[282:37.86]Can you equip that beacon so I can try out the missile launcher?
[282:42.44]Yeah.
[282:42.66]Are we doing that again or do you want to go back to normal and do the stuff?
[282:48.55]I don't really want to do that mission again necessarily, but... Let's check this one out.
[282:58.13]I wish I had a better one of these.
[282:59.17]I haven't really gotten anything.
[283:04.63]Oh, I can't use it anymore, can I?
[283:07.89]Oh, yeah, looks like you can't.
[283:09.18]Are we going back to normal level right now?
[283:14.08]No one will give me any instruction.
[283:16.30]Are we just moving on?
[283:17.34]Like, to the next mission?
[283:21.14]Yeah, I wanted to get some higher level stuff.
[283:22.74]I don't know, we can't even use it in normal.
[283:25.33]This is the most current normal mission we can do.
[283:27.78]Oh, it says weapon level one that tells you there.
[283:30.86]Well, I can use these two.
[283:32.12]Should I not?
[283:32.50]Can I use the new core?
[283:35.20]I can.
[283:35.68]Rush core.
[283:36.89]So what mission are we doing?
[283:38.81]The newest one that we haven't done yet in normal.
[283:44.01]Okay.
[283:45.41]Should I use the missile launcher or swap to something else?
[283:48.74]I can't use it because it's level eight.
[283:49.98]Never mind.
[283:51.16]So unequip your marker.
[283:54.90]Where are my pants?
[283:55.62]Somebody said that she's wearing the reverse of what I'm wearing.
[284:00.36]Yeah, I got no shirt on and pants.
[284:03.94]She has no pants on but shirt.
[284:05.86]You've been talking a lot about how few clothes you're wearing in this stream.
[284:08.74]I talk about that every day.
[284:09.84]Are you trying to arouse some suspicion in your chat?
[284:15.44]We open and close every stream with, you know, you don't have any clothes on.
[284:26.08]Are there going to be flying bugs?
[284:28.45]Frogs.
[284:28.79]Looks like... There's the alien infantry, so I think it's frogs.
[284:32.21]Okay.
[284:33.23]Looks pretty froggy.
[284:35.01]Then I will just go... Well, then I won't equip double melee weapons.
[284:46.49]There's too many gear sets that I need to be worried about all the time.
[284:51.68]Hey, just don't worry.
[284:54.11]You'll be alright.
[284:57.05]That sounds good.
[284:57.61]I'm gonna try this.
[285:02.49]Oh wait, he gets the helicopters?
[285:05.89]The Air Raider?
[285:08.41]The Ranger gets the helicopters in time.
[285:18.09]Fight a bite.
[285:20.46]Fight a bite?
[285:21.91]You can aim even while you're being bitten.
[285:23.45]Aim at the enemy and press the attack button to shoot.
[285:24.91]You can escape from an enemy that's biting you by defeating it.
[285:28.02]Great.
[285:28.52]Oh, that's wonderful.
[285:32.66]Oh, man.
[285:35.08]Artillery would be nice here, but I kind of switch characters.
[285:39.24]I love this.
[285:40.12]This is fucking great.
[285:41.78]Oh, my God.
[285:42.24]This is single fire.
[285:43.24]That's funny.
[285:46.91]I'm looking a lot like a mech now.
[285:49.39]Oh, they're up here.
[285:52.99]Yes, they are.
[285:57.96]Oh, boy.
[285:58.70]The building is gone.
[286:00.16]Yeah.
[286:01.56]I can't... The PlayStation 4 was not equipped to handle this.
[286:05.60]No.
[286:10.68]Is this on normal or hard?
[286:12.06]Is there friendly fire?
[286:13.54]It should be normal.
[286:16.37]I need, like, a better gun than this.
[286:20.03]Yeah, I should just start with my other loadout, actually.
[286:23.57]I should've stuck with Artillery Boy.
[286:26.41]Yeah.
[286:26.78]I didn't know it was a fucking ant swarm mission.
[286:28.84]Yeah.
[286:31.38]Miraged.
[286:32.30]I don't even know what these grenades are doing.
[286:35.24]There are frogs.
[286:36.10]Alright, get some stuff.
[286:39.38]Oh, like pellets I'm throwing.
[286:42.10]Hey buddy.
[286:47.75]I feel bad killing this frog.
[286:49.13]He's so much like a human.
[286:51.95]He's just like a human!
[286:56.51]There really is this purple slime.
[286:58.08]Oh my goodness, I'm getting a little pissed in the e-buy, guys.
[287:00.24]What the hell was that?
[287:08.10]Had a little bit of panic attack, that's all.
[287:16.84]This thing just absolutely rips through.
[287:19.68]I should have been using this before with the red ants.
[287:27.43]Eat this.
[287:29.85]It's my butt.
[287:33.01]I have to press the button every time.
[287:46.12]He's dead, dude.
[287:46.60]No, he's not.
[287:51.02]No, he's not.
[287:58.55]uh down this road here my channel colors like you said and I just look like a raspberry and blueberry popsicle just watch out for the monsters it didn't work out the aliens and monsters are in it together
[288:18.71]What's the difference between the aliens and monsters?
[288:20.85]The aliens came from above and the monsters came from below?
[288:23.41]No one knows.
[288:25.75]I'm doing pretty far.
[288:27.75]I gotta get back here.
[288:34.43]Looked like I came out of the frog.
[288:36.27]I was in his stomach.
[288:41.91]I need to fly up there and do a little bit of spray.
[288:45.83]I feel like I'm just like...
[288:48.65]I'm not being effective.
[288:51.09]I can't even see what I'm throwing.
[289:00.53]Well, we're not dying as fast.
[289:05.69]We are not.
[289:12.02]Electricity!
[289:12.84]Does he have a melee?
[289:13.90]Dude, I'm shocking this guy's brain.
[289:20.49]I saw that.
[289:23.58]Oh, missed one.
[289:25.22]Yeah.
[289:26.94]Well, we're using these stupid grenades because it's so annoying to shoot my stupid gun.
[289:34.69]This thing's alright, but it doesn't seem too effective.
[289:38.27]Maybe when it gets a higher rank or level, because just... I don't know how long it's taking me to kill this regular Ray Ant.
[289:44.68]Yeah, that's how I feel.
[289:46.44]I'd use a level 1 weapon for this.
[289:49.86]Yeah, I don't know about that thing.
[289:51.52]It's cool, but... It is cool, but it's not as good as this.
[289:58.29]Not even close.
[290:00.75]Alright, let me get some stuff.
[290:03.72]I hope this mission's over soon.
[290:04.92]I don't want to use this stuff anymore.
[290:09.62]Probably close.
[290:10.36]No pets.
[290:10.88]What should be on a leash?
[290:13.36]A pet?
[290:14.52]Yeah, they're a pet.
[290:16.52]They're on our pet planet.
[290:30.44]Why am I missing this one box?
[290:31.92]Is it above me or below me?
[290:38.11]Watch out.
[290:39.79]There's humans over here.
[290:44.30]Watch out.
[290:46.40]These things are like humans.
[290:57.82]My thumb, like, I keep pushing my thumb so far up on the left joystick that it touches the touchpad, and my screen keeps showing me those options.
[291:07.99]Uh-oh, red ants.
[291:09.37]Bad.
[291:09.85]Ah.
[291:09.91]Man, I wish I was other guy.
[291:14.21]I wish I was ant kill guy.
[291:16.69]I'm not going to get the fuck out of here.
[291:19.91]Yeah, I was really good ant kill guy last time as well.
[291:22.83]I'm sorry, I just shot you three times.
[291:26.46]Only three?
[291:26.88]My hitbox was so large on this weapon.
[291:29.86]Oh fuck.
[291:30.56]Okay.
[291:31.48]Time to really get the fuck out of here.
[291:39.21]I am basically the tank now though.
[291:45.73]There's so many.
[291:56.33]Frog guy back.
[291:57.81]Go to hell.
[292:02.95]Ants don't go to hell or anywhere.
[292:05.52]They go to ant heaven.
[292:09.86]Why?
[292:12.74]Why would they do that?
[292:16.93]My grandma was an ant.
[292:20.51]My grandma was a queen ant.
[292:26.75]Can we deal with the frog over here, please?
[292:29.37]What, the frog?
[292:30.35]Are you pulling a you-know-who right now?
[292:32.65]Yeah, I can't say it.
[292:37.89]The joke is off-limits.
[292:39.67]Why are you doing off-limit references?
[292:43.19]You got the... You do only references that are... You got the syllabus.
[292:48.92]You got the syllabus before the stream.
[292:52.10]You know it's allowed and it's not allowed.
[292:53.32]I didn't read it.
[292:53.94]No one reads their syllabus.
[292:55.56]And that's what happens when you get punished for not reading the syllabus.
[292:58.48]Now you're in trouble because you want to make references that are not allowed.
[293:05.09]You're alright.
[293:05.47]My gun is capable of freeing me from the ant.
[293:09.41]I am on my way.
[293:11.19]So you're alright?
[293:12.45]I'm alright, but I'm going to die soon if I don't get healed.
[293:15.09]I'm dead.
[293:16.28]I feel like every ant has ignored me because I'm not doing anything.
[293:20.68]Those are some cool flips you did there to get to me.
[293:23.04]Thanks, man.
[293:23.80]I was impressed.
[293:26.34]Speaking of heals, I kind of need this.
[293:29.88]Oh, fuck.
[293:31.42]And this is where it all goes to hell.
[293:35.35]This is where it goes to hell.
[293:36.29]Squad following me.
[293:39.69]True.
[293:41.65]Flipping around all over the place.
[293:50.08]Alright.
[293:50.60]So am I crazy in saying this in chat?
[293:52.74]Some chat people have to know, did the Air Raider used to have the tanks and the helicopters?
[293:58.89]I was told that the Ranger gets tanks.
[294:01.69]Yeah, he does.
[294:02.77]In his equipment, there was a spot for tanks.
[294:04.67]Like, it doesn't, like, I don't know.
[294:06.33]Your name is Air Raider.
[294:07.31]You don't get the helicopters?
[294:09.27]So Air Raider does not get helicopters.
[294:12.46]no that's all I want maybe because ranger was kind of just default and maybe a little boring for people they decided to give the ranger some other stuff are there any more classes by chance no no okay they just took the floor and were like let's just make a bunch I think the last game the jetpack one was new wasn't it um I don't remember
[294:36.26]I mean, I only played the last one.
[294:38.34]I played four.
[294:39.02]I think I played the third one.
[294:41.90]I didn't get it at all.
[294:43.91]Yeah, Air Raider only gets land vehicles and APCs.
[294:47.81]I feel like the Ranger would get the APCs.
[294:51.37]I don't freaking know.
[294:53.19]I got the Minion Buster.
[294:55.51]New stuff.
[294:56.05]Nice.
[294:57.95]Better Plasma Cannon.
[294:59.88]Better Grit Shot.
[295:00.66]I got the Minion Buster.
[295:06.49]That's my cannon.
[295:07.41]Oh, and I never used my collector thing that I had.
[295:10.27]That's not really that much of an upgrade, but it's okay.
[295:14.75]Oh, and the dinky motorcycles.
[295:21.27]Oh, we're doing a cave.
[295:23.26]Is it a cave?
[295:24.14]We're doing the ant holes.
[295:25.12]Alright, I'm going to put on the... Anti-ant gear coming.
[295:29.08]Where is it?
[295:29.46]This thing?
[295:33.18]And... Hmm...
[295:38.74]I wonder what else I should do.
[295:39.64]Maybe I should add a shotgun.
[295:41.06]Just level it up anyways.
[295:44.09]Oh yeah, this stupid thing.
[295:50.10]This is perfect.
[295:51.36]1.5% completion rate.
[295:51.94]Yeah, this game is absolutely huge.
[295:55.91]Wait, just in terms of how many things there are to find?
[295:58.87]I mean, we're on level 17 on normal, I believe.
[296:02.37]And we're like 1.5% through the content?
[296:04.99]Well, because I think every level is a piece of that percentage.
[296:08.53]Every difficulty.
[296:10.33]So, there are like 170... There's like 170 levels.
[296:15.33]Each one of those levels has a different difficulty.
[296:17.77]And there are... There's hundreds and hundreds of battles.
[296:21.51]Am I crazy, or did the last game have like a DLC...
[296:24.97]That added like 40 levels.
[296:28.37]Do you want to use the laser?
[296:29.61]Do you want to use the laser guide kit for this or no?
[296:34.98]Oh, no.
[296:36.84]I am playing reindeer.
[296:37.94]Each difficulty with each class.
[296:40.40]So there are four classes and let's say there's 150 levels and five difficulties per level.
[296:48.38]So you're doing that's 5, 10, 15, 20 just for the classes.
[296:56.20]Two for you.
[296:57.28]You'll see that added like the dragons and stuff.
[297:03.02]Dude, I'm telling you, it's Etalyx every time.
[297:05.56]That's because I'm being falsely accused of things.
[297:08.06]Also, you were the last one, literally the last mission.
[297:10.98]So I never have back.
[297:12.74]Literally.
[297:13.90]Can someone back him up, his claim?
[297:15.54]Because I think it's baseless.
[297:18.95]Anyways, you distracted me from what I was doing.
[297:27.43]Well, at least I got time to, like, stand up and stretch.
[297:29.71]Like, if every time I'm waiting for Talos, I do push-ups, I'm gonna be jacked.
[297:33.34]You only have one weapon per slot for your new character.
[297:36.12]Should play something that doesn't pad the game.
[297:39.66]Yeah, but this is really good, just... It is fun just to kind of run around and shoot bugs.
[297:48.44]There we go.
[297:49.02]Oh, I'm gonna love this level.
[297:51.48]Oh, man.
[297:51.72]Oh, man.
[297:56.76]That is... That thing is awesome.
[298:05.56]Alright, here we go.
[298:06.68]Monsters!
[298:11.12]Just melt, melt, melt, melt.
[298:14.92]Holy shit, these grenades are huge.
[298:17.82]Going down the toilet drain.
[298:23.82]Compared to the little tiny firecracker things.
[298:28.24]Alright.
[298:28.90]Boxes.
[298:29.32]Do we get them?
[298:30.36]Holy shit.
[298:31.00]It takes like 300 bullets.
[298:34.02]What's my other gun?
[298:36.68]A rocket launcher.
[298:38.90]The Bloodstorm.
[298:41.97]Very edgy name.
[298:42.71]I like it.
[298:44.05]I think these are the web spiders that are down here.
[298:45.91]Nope.
[298:51.13]They are some kind of spider.
[298:52.61]Tunnel behind you.
[298:58.13]Dude, this gun is so weak.
[299:04.10]Just fill the holes.
[299:09.32]Oh boy.
[299:09.66]Fill both holes.
[299:12.92]Watch your language.
[299:13.73]What?
[299:15.51]Oh, whatever.
[299:16.17]You know what I'm saying.
[299:17.55]Yeah, he was saying to fill both holes.
[299:24.65]What do you want me to say?
[299:25.61]Oh, and I just fucked up.
[299:28.57]I want you to say, there's monsters coming from every direction.
[299:32.19]Burn.
[299:38.29]Dude, these grenades are like bigger explosions than the airstrikes I was calling in.
[299:47.42]We're going to have to use full force in both of these holes.
[299:53.06]You really are.
[299:53.95]You are quite a comedian.
[299:56.49]What a comedian.
[299:58.05]No, I want the help.
[300:03.85]I am just, you know, repeating my favorite joke that I heard from one comedian during my 985.
[300:11.60]When did I make that joke?
[300:13.26]When did I make that reference ever in my entire life?
[300:18.32]Oh, you're going to sprint?
[300:20.81]What?
[300:21.19]Yeah, elbow.
[300:22.06]Ranger has a sprint.
[300:23.84]Press L3.
[300:24.74]Hold it.
[300:26.30]Why does it zoom into my asshole?
[300:32.01]And then you have the longer radius around your body.
[300:38.19]I'm pretty fast now, actually.
[300:40.65]I'll scout it out.
[300:41.61]Looks like we got... Man, it hurts to hold this down.
[300:47.50]It looks like there are frogs down here.
[300:53.51]Why are there frogs in these holes?
[300:56.08]That is a wonderful question.
[300:59.20]And why does it put my camera in my butt?
[301:04.42]There are aliens underground.
[301:05.88]Did you know that?
[301:10.33]Watch the other side, they're probably gonna come to you to the right.
[301:17.03]That frog is dead.
[301:21.24]Dude, I love this grenade.
[301:22.10]Are you sure the frog is dead?
[301:23.40]Yeah, this missile launcher is way overkill for what we're fighting.
[301:28.53]Plus it hits the ceiling.
[301:31.34]My rocket launcher hits the ceiling.
[301:33.82]We've got some crate over here.
[301:39.24]Well, that was a useless item.
[301:42.08]They should have just been dashed, man.
[301:48.55]I wonder when the boss is.
[301:49.61]Do you remember playing this and we fought the gigantic lizard?
[301:53.89]Oh, yeah, that happened.
[301:56.07]There's also, like, a queen in it.
[301:57.67]Oh, that's great.
[301:59.77]In one of these caves.
[302:02.99]Come on, burn him.
[302:05.07]Burn!
[302:05.75]Oh, I'm dead.
[302:07.17]Dead?
[302:08.52]Yep.
[302:10.28]I threw a grenade just as one of them jumped in front of me.
[302:17.80]Ah, this thing really is so good.
[302:19.36]Oh, boy.
[302:23.26]This, like, super grenade shotgun.
[302:25.00]Hurts my eyes.
[302:27.81]Makes my eyes feel pretty great.
[302:30.35]What the fuck?
[302:40.86]Oh boy, I'm gonna die.
[302:42.86]Fall back.
[302:45.15]Fall back.
[302:45.67]Falling back.
[302:46.55]Falling back.
[302:48.39]Dude, they're dealing a surprising amount of damage.
[302:53.30]God, you got him in their weak spots.
[302:57.63]Uh-oh.
[302:59.05]I'm just relaxing on the ground.
[303:00.29]Sorry, you didn't happen just to throw a grenade over at us, did you?
[303:04.06]Nope.
[303:05.30]Are you positive about that?
[303:06.38]Can you do me a huge favor and pound this hole with all you've got?
[303:09.72]Are you certain of that?
[303:12.90]I was.
[303:13.45]Are you sure you were giving it all you've got?
[303:15.11]Oh, there's a bunch of health now.
[303:17.73]We're good.
[303:20.89]I'm taking it all.
[303:21.65]I hope I get some.
[303:24.55]You can have that one.
[303:27.85]You can take that one.
[303:33.48]Ooh, that's a weapon.
[303:35.30]Got a lot of weapon crates this time.
[303:43.78]Man.
[303:43.96]I hope I get some more level zeros.
[303:45.72]What a fun game just to kind of chill and play with friends.
[303:48.09]You know what I'm saying?
[303:49.19]Yeah.
[303:49.61]Are we all just chilling right now?
[303:50.83]I think that's what this is.
[303:52.37]I'm just like chilling, playing the game, and I'm having fun with my friends.
[303:56.15]With my friends.
[303:58.16]You chillin' there?
[304:08.40]Up here?
[304:09.14]I can't get up there.
[304:13.57]What am I supposed to do?
[304:15.21]Should I go look?
[304:16.21]Can we go this way?
[304:18.09]I can't get up there either.
[304:19.95]I don't think there's anything over here.
[304:22.37]Oh, yes there is.
[304:27.01]What the hell am I supposed to do about this?
[304:29.01]There are people fighting in here.
[304:30.01]Maybe I can just bait them over here?
[304:37.24]I like how you just holding the left thumbstick is as fast as me.
[304:41.88]R1, R1, switch, R1, switch, R1.
[304:44.76]I have to do like a sequence of modifiers to go this fast.
[304:51.65]Well, this really hurts my thumb.
[304:55.70]Any consolation a new species 70 meters long We're asking about bosses, maybe this is the Queen ant probably Urgent if you don't call it like enemy Omega I
[305:25.60]Well, I'm very close.
[305:27.32]So, I think we're about to fight the bad enemy.
[305:32.27]The big one.
[305:34.31]The scary one.
[305:36.37]That does sound accurate.
[305:39.81]Dude, this room feels like just... This room feels like... Oh, I'm just begging for a boss fight in here.
[305:45.52]Up top.
[305:46.38]And it really was so dark in the last game, actually.
[305:48.98]I remember we had some of the fights in rooms like this where you couldn't see anything.
[305:52.62]Huh.
[305:53.28]Well...
[305:57.37]We can really only go one way.
[306:00.39]Not really at all, actually.
[306:01.46]Do we have to keep going down?
[306:03.70]We might have to keep going this way.
[306:04.66]Aren't they below us?
[306:08.68]According to the mini-map?
[306:11.38]We can go this way.
[306:12.16]I think we have to keep going the direction we were coming.
[306:14.94]Hopefully there's no fall damage.
[306:17.52]So back towards me.
[306:21.12]Let's see if you're right.
[306:22.06]They're just on the other side of the map.
[306:23.61]I'll be there in a moment.
[306:33.11]I don't see anything.
[306:33.71]I think we might be lost in the tunnels.
[306:41.45]Should be this way.
[306:42.20]Is that a dead end?
[306:51.24]Oh, down here.
[306:51.84]Oh, that's just wrapped around.
[306:57.55]Really?
[306:58.47]Yeah.
[306:59.55]I think it was the other way.
[307:02.52]But we came from that way.
[307:03.84]Did we?
[307:04.36]So, hold on.
[307:07.10]Split up.
[307:10.02]My hand hurts so much.
[307:11.64]Would splitting up actually help if we get lost and can't find each other anyway?
[307:15.56]I mean, there's nothing over here, so it has to be that way.
[307:22.31]Is there like a map of any kind?
[307:24.85]Up top right.
[307:28.53]Well, I know that.
[307:29.55]It's not what I was asking.
[307:35.33]Maybe we just have to keep going that way.
[307:38.21]Wait, what about over here?
[307:40.01]Can this be shot down?
[307:44.25]It just looks like a dead end.
[307:45.83]Is this just a dead end?
[307:46.87]It looks like this water here.
[307:49.38]So are they all up or down according to the mini-map?
[307:57.59]That's a great question.
[307:58.43]Because there's like a line pointing up.
[308:08.99]And I'm about to be right under or above them.
[308:11.59]I'm not sure which.
[308:12.25]I think we're going the right way.
[308:18.98]We are going... There they are.
[308:20.18]They're right here.
[308:22.68]Well, I would have got there first.
[308:25.13]I'm sorry, that was all my fault.
[308:26.41]And it's a frog.
[308:28.37]Do you guys forgive me?
[308:32.67]Yeah, come on.
[308:38.49]It's comically inaccurate.
[308:42.11]Watch out, they're trying to get up top.
[308:43.91]Are you saying that there will be more monsters?
[308:53.12]There will be more monsters.
[308:56.48]I just barely didn't run out of fuel there.
[308:58.20]I can't see anything.
[309:06.79]No idea what's happening.
[309:10.97]Annihilate.
[309:12.65]That's all you need to know.
[309:15.86]Annihilate.
[309:16.74]Annihilate.
[309:17.48]Annihilate.
[309:18.94]Is that it?
[309:19.62]Alright, let's get the stuff.
[309:24.32]Chad is arguing on how to pronounce Jupiter again.
[309:27.12]Jupe.
[309:27.82]It's Juppiter.
[309:31.27]You're being contrary on purpose.
[309:33.07]That's not what it is.
[309:35.53]It's Jupter.
[309:37.31]Yeah, I think the J is silent.
[309:41.81]Juppiter.
[309:45.06]What is it?
[309:45.40]J is silent.
[309:46.70]Are you making markers?
[309:48.94]Oopter.
[309:49.40]How are you making the markers?
[309:50.50]Oopter.
[309:52.95]Oh, I just sent the location to you.
[309:55.31]Yeah.
[309:55.57]How are you?
[309:56.29]That's if you if you press your.
[309:59.25]The follow on forces.
[310:00.25]Oh, that's very handy.
[310:01.17]Your thumb.
[310:01.57]But the touch screen thing down.
[310:04.29]If you just touch the touch screen.
[310:08.15]This is big again.
[310:09.13]We've got frogs or so it seems.
[310:17.69]We did it.
[310:20.26]Hold on.
[310:20.44]How many things are there to say?
[310:22.30]Gestures?
[310:25.82]Frog dead.
[310:33.89]I'm really sad.
[310:35.01]Watch out for these enemies.
[310:37.13]We're fine.
[310:37.71]We're fine.
[310:45.19]Yeah.
[310:47.34]Yeah.
[310:48.82]Yeah.
[310:49.74]Oh, dude.
[310:50.06]He's gonna show it to me.
[310:50.90]Alright.
[310:51.66]Where's the boss?
[310:55.08]There's a hole.
[310:55.95]No, that's not a hole.
[310:56.99]What?
[310:57.43]There's a hole this way.
[310:58.69]Found it.
[310:59.05]Right in his mouth.
[311:05.53]Come on.
[311:05.81]I bet this cave is big enough I could shoot this missile.
[311:11.61]Well, keep trying, I guess.
[311:12.61]Alright.
[311:13.47]Are you dead?
[311:14.21]Not yet.
[311:16.29]His body is everywhere.
[311:17.58]I love how I literally can't help him.
[311:19.96]Whoa!
[311:20.50]Okay.
[311:22.18]This is where I can help.
[311:25.98]That almost feels like this shouldn't, wasn't supposed to happen.
[311:29.28]Jesus.
[311:30.14]Whoa.
[311:30.72]Watch out.
[311:31.10]Watch out.
[311:31.44]They're everywhere now.
[311:32.16]Are they behind us?
[311:35.10]Yes, they're everywhere.
[311:35.96]Oh, God.
[311:36.52]They brought us into a trap.
[311:38.33]I'll watch this hole.
[311:39.31]You guys watch the other hole.
[311:40.77]Holy fuck.
[311:41.37]I can't throw my bombs from here.
[311:46.12]Oh my god, I'm getting out of here.
[311:48.20]I'm going up somewhere.
[311:56.84]Ayayay.
[311:58.76]Alright, got all the stuff.
[312:01.22]Oh, the tunnel's clear, so you can, like... The tunnel is clear.
[312:03.96]Put your back on the funnel.
[312:08.63]Coming.
[312:14.10]Yeah, don't be discouraged.
[312:15.42]No, I gotta go.
[312:16.08]I gotta get out of here.
[312:17.89]I mean, it's just like a 4 versus 100.
[312:19.55]Don't be discouraged.
[312:20.95]Hey, is this that new indie game that I saw?
[312:23.29]Dwarf game?
[312:25.37]The Dwarf Court?
[312:30.45]I can't say this pun.
[312:31.97]Dwarf Court?
[312:33.75]What?
[312:34.65]Yeah, it's like Dwarf Court, but with dwarves.
[312:38.31]A new indie game?
[312:39.37]Dwarf Court?
[312:40.29]The new indie game.
[312:43.89]There's a lot of weapons.
[312:45.99]Where you in the tunnels and you dig... Minecraft.
[312:52.38]Not Dwarf Fortress.
[312:56.42]Not Dwarf Fortress, no.
[312:58.62]The other one.
[312:59.30]Not Dwarf... Dwarf Fortress.
[313:02.38]Why would you say that pun?
[313:03.88]Like a Dwarf... Dwarf Fortress.
[313:07.33]You would say Dwarf Fortress.
[313:11.54]Okay, I guess you're just better than me.
[313:13.96]Dwarf Court.
[313:15.21]Dude, you're like your own chat now, you know, telling people how to spell, how to say Jupiter.
[313:23.63]I'll say Dwarf the way I want to.
[313:30.49]It's... And by the way, it's Deep Rock Galactic.
[313:32.55]That's what I said.
[313:33.75]Not Galactica.
[313:34.43]You said Galactica.
[313:36.49]Fucking nerd.
[313:37.33]Clip it.
[313:44.85]I feel like I'm aiming down and I'm in the sky.
[313:50.05]That's gonna make me throw up.
[313:50.97]I need to stop doing that.
[313:51.71]Well, instead, what is up ahead?
[313:53.71]What is up?
[313:54.63]What are we doing?
[313:55.13]Are we going down this tunnel?
[313:58.33]We got a tunnel over here.
[314:02.31]Tunnel?
[314:02.95]It's too dangerous to move on, guys.
[314:09.26]Yes, we've killed every enemy in the game.
[314:11.28]Time to retreat.
[314:12.64]Holy shit, I just broke my PlayStation.
[314:16.00]Uh, excuse me, who's PlayStation?
[314:17.25]Oh, I mean your PlayStation.
[314:20.97]You, uh, did what to it?
[314:22.17]I broke it.
[314:24.05]Um... I smashed it with a hammer as hard as I could and I don't know what happened to it.
[314:30.54]I killed the framerate.
[314:33.58]Alright, Star, how are you doing?
[314:34.44]You alright?
[314:34.92]Frames are dead.
[314:36.02]Are you good?
[314:36.48]Frames are dead.
[314:38.52]Yeah, I'm good.
[314:39.22]Oh, are you talking about how much you were in pain?
[314:42.53]Oh, no, my thumb hurts a lot because running is hard.
[314:48.81]Okay, plasma, big cannon.
[314:51.31]Can I get good weapons?
[314:52.73]What are you playing on?
[314:54.39]Hard difficulties.
[314:57.67]Secret of the Cave.
[314:59.79]This sounds kind of like a boss.
[315:01.77]We've confirmed a cave that could be the monster's nest.
[315:05.61]Monsters are spotted... Wait, what?
[315:07.58]Oh, this is the next level.
[315:13.14]I'll see you in Dwarf's Court.
[315:15.12]I'll see you in Dwarf's Court.
[315:19.79]I'll see you in Dwarf's Court.
[315:26.29]Let's see.
[315:30.22]Hmm.
[315:31.92]I guess I'll try it again.
[315:42.30]This thing is new.
[315:43.60]Up to level 6, though.
[315:44.60]I need something better than that.
[315:46.46]I'll put this back on.
[315:49.59]I'm going to use the reverser.
[315:51.33]This thing is a level 1.
[315:52.11]I don't want to use that shit.
[315:53.37]Alright, I'm glad I can't beat.
[315:58.41]I didn't like this thing, though.
[316:01.57]I'll try and use it again.
[316:06.40]No, I want this.
[316:07.26]Alright, I'm ready.
[316:17.89]Oh, excuse me.
[316:18.79]Who's last this time?
[316:20.53]I was, for the first time in like two hours.
[316:23.07]No.
[316:24.95]No.
[316:25.97]I was waiting to be done until I heard that journal move almost.
[316:28.59]Uh-huh.
[316:29.39]Uh-huh.
[316:29.91]Alright, commence the operation.
[316:34.75]Looks like more ants.
[316:42.52]Looks like we're fighting some ants.
[316:43.46]I thought we were going to be in the tunnel again.
[316:44.78]I thought we were going to fight a boss in the tunnel.
[316:48.80]I see what this is.
[316:49.76]This is a cool weapon.
[316:51.76]This is a long reload time.
[316:53.34]Oh my god.
[316:58.77]All I have is grenade.
[317:02.25]And heal.
[317:04.14]Alright, check this out.
[317:07.48]I don't want to use Wasted.
[317:11.86]I really want to get a better version of this thing.
[317:13.68]This thing is so good.
[317:15.26]If it did more damage, it would be perfect.
[317:22.94]Did you do like the chef finger kiss?
[317:24.72]I did, but I didn't use any fingers, so I was just implying to everybody that that's what I was doing.
[317:29.94]I think you jumped in front of that and it didn't hurt you, but it hurt me.
[317:33.55]Oh, there!
[317:33.95]Yes!
[317:34.05]Yes!
[317:38.65]Who is this guy?
[317:39.89]It's a kaiju.
[317:41.54]It actually is Kaiju.
[317:43.52]Look out!
[317:44.44]I think the J is silent in that, though.
[317:48.48]Uh, Caillou.
[317:50.29]Harry's gonna do something crazy!
[317:53.13]Blast him!
[317:56.73]Oh!
[318:00.69]I'm punching him right in the face.
[318:03.69]I can't see what I'm doing, but I know this... Ooh!
[318:07.92]He's just sliding down.
[318:11.31]Alright, I gotta get higher ground.
[318:12.47]It's so human-like.
[318:14.37]Can he stop hitting our buildings?
[318:16.75]Oh!
[318:16.93]Oh, he hit all the buildings.
[318:19.11]What?
[318:19.23]Legendary.
[318:19.59]Wow, this game's already better than Monster Hunter: World.
[318:21.71]Legendary Pokémon.
[318:22.65]I'm gonna get him right in his eyeball.
[318:26.37]He's disorienting him.
[318:30.40]Hey, let me mark him in case you don't see him.
[318:32.24]Check that.
[318:37.20]Eat that!
[318:38.06]Ooh.
[318:40.96]Oh my god.
[318:41.64]Are they all flying around?
[318:42.66]Oh yeah.
[318:43.98]This was not a good jackhammer weapon.
[318:45.47]Come on, get closer.
[318:46.31]Look at this.
[318:47.43]That looks beautiful.
[318:48.35]I'm gonna take a screenshot and put it in the background.
[318:54.57]Employ EDF.
[318:56.27]Get us the guy with the infinite amount of grenades and like the football arm.
[319:04.44]How much health does he have?
[319:05.56]The bullets are tiny mosquito bites.
[319:10.99]He's glowing.
[319:12.71]He's going crazy.
[319:15.07]Did he get you guys with it?
[319:16.89]No.
[319:17.27]He's looking at me.
[319:18.55]I can heal you, Germobot.
[319:19.84]Again?
[319:20.12]I just landed on him.
[319:22.14]I have it healed on me.
[319:23.80]This is insane.
[319:24.86]It has nanomachines.
[319:26.86]So do it.
[319:28.58]You're nowhere near me.
[319:29.48]You're the fucking fast flying idiot.
[319:32.09]You're the idiot.
[319:32.71]Hit the brakes.
[319:33.57]Whoa.
[319:34.25]Yeah, he got me.
[319:35.25]Brakes.
[319:35.77]I'm alive.
[319:38.54]I think he really likes me.
[319:40.27]Okay, stand near me.
[319:41.35]I'm doing it, and I have not received a single heal.
[319:43.63]Did that really not heal you, and I can't reload it?
[319:47.57]It didn't heal you.
[319:48.21]Don't worry, guys.
[319:50.03]I'll kill him.
[319:50.45]Don't worry.
[319:50.87]The monster that's destroying the whole city is just stomping around.
[319:54.13]Don't worry.
[319:55.51]I'll heal you.
[319:59.10]Man, he's so fast.
[320:05.10]I'm tickling him right now.
[320:09.66]Hey, if you get hurt, don't worry, I'll heal you.
[320:12.26]Charge again so I can throw the Leipnir.
[320:17.35]Charge again, come on.
[320:18.63]Holy shit, look at all the paint.
[320:20.69]Did he just puke all over the whole city?
[320:23.07]Look at the city!
[320:25.71]That's insane.
[320:26.56]He just slimed you.
[320:27.92]There really is just purple slime everywhere, yeah.
[320:32.46]Yuck!
[320:35.48]Understood.
[320:36.34]Commence attack.
[320:39.18]Support the infantry and protect the tanks.
[320:42.72]That's crazy.
[320:43.78]It really is everywhere.
[320:45.06]But really, imagine there's a giant Godzilla.
[320:49.67]You call in the guy who throws grenades.
[320:53.59]That's what you do.
[320:55.23]We need him.
[320:56.19]The three of us.
[320:57.49]There's a guy who throws grenades in the Avengers.
[321:01.31]You're the Hawkeye of our group.
[321:02.77]What are you guys playing?
[321:05.29]I'm playing as the fencer in a mech suit.
[321:09.39]Oh, so you're gonna go punch his toes, or...?
[321:11.71]I did punch his toes.
[321:12.79]Now I'm also shooting, like, explosives on his back and shooting it with a shotgun.
[321:22.76]Hit him, he go!
[321:23.28]Uh-oh, here comes the electricity roar.
[321:32.18]Oh, electricity!
[321:36.29]Should we be shooting the scales, the blue ones?
[321:39.71]I have been, yeah.
[321:40.21]What extra damage do you think?
[321:42.61]I would think the three on his chest, but I have no idea.
[321:45.17]I think you have to aim for the butt.
[321:46.49]There he goes!
[321:49.22]That's a big belly flop.
[321:54.44]Didn't hurt me.
[321:55.40]Nothing's gonna take down grenade guy.
[321:58.24]Oh, that hurt.
[321:58.94]That actually did hurt a lot.
[322:02.04]Don't worry.
[322:03.30]I'll just keep throwing.
[322:06.28]The new Godzilla movie is looking pretty good.
[322:09.25]No, come back over here!
[322:10.29]But they still reach, right?
[322:11.91]Nooooooo!
[322:16.91]Nooo!
[322:17.13]Half of my loadout that takes three minutes to recharge.
[322:21.12]He's gonna kill me.
[322:21.80]I'm dead here.
[322:22.28]I just almost watched my own death.
[322:27.20]Man, if only I had cruise missiles.
[322:28.86]I feel like I just cocked grenades.
[322:39.05]Well, I you know we finally got to fight a boss I think it's a perfect amount of killing Yeah, I mean they're the greatest brothers be real here real the game is an absolute grind fest The whole game is a grind
[323:02.19]Oh, yeah.
[323:02.87]But there are interesting accounts.
[323:05.14]You get something new every single mission.
[323:08.96]I don't.
[323:10.50]Well, you switch classes.
[323:11.96]I don't.
[323:13.08]Like, I stopped getting new things, like, 10 missions ago.
[323:15.57]Because we're not playing on the harder difficulty one.
[323:18.05]Because we're not playing on the harder difficulty one.
[323:20.41]And since I switched, I've gotten nothing new.
[323:24.90]I got something new every mission, so.
[323:27.04]That's great for you, Italic.
[323:28.80]That's great for you.
[323:30.34]I got jumped on.
[323:33.70]I got Nickelodeon splatted.
[323:37.69]Yeah, I think it's based on how many kills you get.
[323:39.21]Oh, don't.
[323:43.65]Oh, fuck.
[323:45.41]That was not... Oh, boy.
[323:46.71]I need to aim way higher with that.
[323:52.04]also got a grenade launcher are you telling me there's a device that can shoot these I don't have to throw them all uh where's that do you have a heel still no no no I don't because no no one drops med kits anymore do they I love watching a dinosaur in a swimming pool he's just having so much fun how can you kill this guy
[324:22.19]Maybe you literally can't kill this guy and we're just going to retreat.
[324:24.65]It's possible.
[324:29.07]None of those hit.
[324:29.69]Actually, the first time you fight it in EDF4, it walks back into the ocean and I think the mission ends.
[324:35.75]Yeah, I think this is just like do enough damage for him to leave.
[324:40.97]Cut the tail.
[324:42.95]Cut the tail.
[324:43.67]Cut the tail.
[324:46.67]Nice, I got it.
[324:52.10]Wow, did you get him on his back?
[324:57.16]This guy honestly has an incredible arm.
[325:00.53]He's looking at me.
[325:05.65]Oh!
[325:12.34]Oh fuck, he's gonna jump!
[325:22.52]Alright, this time I'm going to be prepared.
[325:25.24]You'll see me in baseball.
[325:26.38]Alright, I'm prepared now.
[325:28.06]Here we go.
[325:29.02]Get it over there.
[325:31.06]Now I'll get some damage done.
[325:35.41]Is he still far away from this?
[325:38.07]No, he's coming back.
[325:39.03]Why?
[325:39.51]Is he... There we go.
[325:41.79]Yeah, right into it.
[325:42.77]Yeah.
[325:49.38]Well, that's great.
[325:57.20]He said, shoot them dead once they're in range.
[325:59.54]That's what the soldier said, if that's what you're wondering.
[326:03.64]Yeah, that's what I was wondering.
[326:06.06]Okay.
[326:10.46]Uh-oh.
[326:13.73]I think he's getting close.
[326:14.67]Gotta get some jackhammer in there.
[326:18.87]Dude, what kind of gear do you think he's gonna drop?
[326:22.42]What if, like, mission ends if you kill him?
[326:24.36]He drops, like, six green chests and you don't get to pick any of them up.
[326:27.61]Fades out.
[326:28.37]How mad would you be?
[326:29.53]Hold on.
[326:32.53]I think we've got some reinforcements here.
[326:34.51]There are a lot of humans on the ground all of a sudden.
[326:36.77]Can you imagine this on Inferno?
[326:42.46]I can.
[326:42.82]Nice!
[326:54.29]Sounds like the Dandelion Witcher 1 voice actor.
[326:58.28]This is a DPS check.
[327:01.02]I'm too close to him.
[327:04.72]I mean, it's not hard.
[327:07.86]It's very difficult for him to hit you.
[327:10.12]Well, you say that, bud.
[327:11.04]Okay, I need to land this one time.
[327:13.52]I need to wait till he goes somewhere, which is... Well, there he goes.
[327:22.57]Alright, now get hit by that.
[327:23.60]I thought, here we go.
[327:25.38]Nice, finally.
[327:26.38]Ooh, nice, mate.
[327:30.62]Oh, wow, Jerma, look at your DPS.
[327:33.08]Well, at least I did it for long enough.
[327:34.43]My DPS meter needs to be reset.
[327:42.57]Why are you the strongest enemy on Earth?
[327:45.62]Because look how big he is.
[327:54.12]How could this creature sustain these attacks?
[327:57.49]There he goes again.
[327:58.17]Bye.
[327:58.45]There's not going to be any city left.
[328:01.45]Who are we even protecting anymore?
[328:07.71]Stop jumping around.
[328:11.58]I can't catch up to this.
[328:20.68]I meant to say sorry to all the people that just died in that building.
[328:26.98]Get over here!
[328:28.36]Wow, this is better than Sea of Thieves when they play all the instruments at the same time.
[328:38.64]So when do they bring in like a new...
[328:42.38]Uhhh... Instead of small arms fire.
[328:45.10]I don't even know where I just went.
[328:47.14]Did I just iframe that?
[328:48.13]Are there any iframes in dodge?
[328:50.55]Wow, is this really actually the Dark Souls of Monster Game?
[328:54.25]Talonx, you get a mech that's big enough to fight him.
[328:57.13]Really?
[328:58.23]As a fencer?
[329:00.31]As the aerobater.
[329:01.92]Oh, but you said you, like I. No, I'm saying like, I'm just saying you as a player.
[329:06.80]Like we as a team.
[329:08.70]Is he gonna jump?
[329:11.10]Can we do like a Megazord where we each sit in one of the seats?
[329:14.49]I wish.
[329:16.71]Come on, I'm waiting for you to do something.
[329:19.91]Come on, jump.
[329:20.87]I too am waiting for something to happen.
[329:24.53]Where's it going?
[329:25.19]Jump!
[329:25.95]Move!
[329:26.19]Are you telling me I gotta throw this already?
[329:29.09]Jump!
[329:30.69]Here we go.
[329:33.85]I've been at like 10 health for a long time now.
[329:37.51]Yes, me as well.
[329:38.47]72 actually.
[329:51.27]yawning there are way more verses to the song how do you get to them honestly ask yourself this as you're shooting him you see how many people are shooting at him how much dps do you think you're adding like what percentage of dps compared to the amount of npcs there are well depends on if they nerf the npcs or are they as strong as the player
[330:15.11]That's what I'm saying.
[330:15.69]This on Inferno is just like, how the fuck are you supposed to do this?
[330:22.89]Retreat!
[330:24.37]Uh, pick me up.
[330:25.63]I killed myself.
[330:26.29]No, I didn't.
[330:26.73]Poor health.
[330:27.57]I'm good.
[330:28.81]Bye.
[330:29.03]Hi.
[330:31.57]Thank you!
[330:32.45]He's running away.
[330:33.09]Don't worry.
[330:33.89]He's retreating.
[330:34.73]He's retreating.
[330:35.20]They just had to yell, retreat at the monster, and then he leaves.
[330:37.70]That was easy.
[330:38.16]Oh, no!
[330:38.86]I'm gonna get out of here.
[330:40.40]Yeah, well, we need to retreat.
[330:42.52]Okay, it's leaving.
[330:44.33]Yeah, well, he heard how scared we were, and then he said, look, I'm gonna go terrorize someone else.
[330:49.67]He only cares about fear.
[330:52.00]Ah.
[330:53.10]He was in our dreams.
[330:54.54]Or maybe it's one of those scenarios where it's like, honey, I shrunk the kids.
[330:58.51]Or he doesn't even know we exist.
[330:59.65]He's just kind of walking around.
[331:00.77]Oh, I got level zero items for my character.
[331:04.63]Well, we didn't really get any weapon crates.
[331:06.87]No.
[331:07.25]None dropped.
[331:09.29]Whoa, hold on a minute.
[331:10.27]Ooh.
[331:11.09]New thing to play with every game.
[331:15.75]Good job, guys.
[331:16.29]Now we're turning the base along the shore.
[331:17.81]Safe journey.
[331:19.62]We're almost at 20.
[331:20.04]Uh-oh.
[331:22.91]Uh-oh.
[331:23.81]I'm going to replace a couple of these things.
[331:26.73]What's the next mission?
[331:30.65]Bolt shooter.
[331:31.83]Encounters on return.
[331:35.63]Return to the base along the shore.
[331:37.42]What do you think, guys?
[331:40.78]What do you want to play with?
[331:42.06]What do you guys want to see?
[331:44.62]That is what I'm wondering.
[331:45.50]I'm tired of my stupid shotgun.
[331:47.06]I just want a kiss.
[331:53.79]I can't put those on.
[331:58.51]I'm actually getting real tired.
[332:01.34]You're getting tired?
[332:02.00]Which is strange, because I've been not getting tired.
[332:05.24]You know what I mean?
[332:11.47]What's the damage on this? 250?
[332:15.48]Plasma Cannon is more than this, and it's only... Oh, yeah, you can use items up to level 6 now.
[332:20.24]Chat reminded me.
[332:20.96]Can I use my new stuff?
[332:22.14]I don't have anything that's level 6.
[332:23.38]I have one thing that's level 6, I think.
[332:26.68]Hmm, I'll go with 3.
[332:33.14]End of the stream Ster voice.
[332:36.62]Uh-oh.
[332:42.40]I have level 0.
[332:45.66]I want to use the Splasher.
[332:47.84]If the monster retreats through your city and destroys it, do you still win?
[332:52.86]Yeah.
[332:55.22]I'll try the lightning bow again.
[332:57.26]Who cares about those people?
[333:01.68]Turn off your webcam.
[333:04.06]I know the joke is you're trying to get me to think my webcam is on, so I go, oh fuck, and I press the webcam button to turn it off.
[333:10.90]But that turns it on.
[333:13.56]But you have to remember, I have a preview of whatever is on the stream over here on a monitor.
[333:19.85]So I already know what's on the stream.
[333:23.73]I'm playing from my stream view.
[333:26.52]Personally.
[333:28.04]Are you actually?
[333:29.76]Yeah.
[333:31.06]Really?
[333:31.38]Why?
[333:33.08]There's no delay.
[333:33.79]What do you have for a capture card?
[333:39.26]What is it?
[333:39.84]Live Gamer Extreme HD or something?
[333:42.52]The Live Gamer Extreme.
[333:45.04]Yeah, it's really, uh... really dumb.
[333:52.93]Live Gamer Extreme.
[333:56.23]HD.
[333:57.95]2.
[333:57.97]HD 2.
[333:58.05]Uh, is this... remember the beast level with the weird robots that lasted like 40 minutes?
[334:08.05]Remember that one?
[334:09.31]That was the worst level.
[334:11.51]You just fought the same... hundred robots.
[334:16.52]And you had to go across... There was another mission you had to destroy ant hills.
[334:21.00]Oh, the beach!
[334:22.59]That's what you meant.
[334:23.99]I fucking love the beach level.
[334:25.59]I played the beach level over and over and over again.
[334:29.29]Me and Arcadon played the beach level like a hundred times.
[334:33.79]Well, here we are.
[334:34.83]Enjoy.
[334:36.71]So what's so good about this?
[334:38.25]Nothing.
[334:40.69]Oh.
[334:45.88]That didn't do as much as I wanted it to.
[334:48.40]I'll be honest.
[334:50.75]It's like the air raid is doing the majority of the damage here.
[334:55.15]Yeah.
[334:55.33]What's new?
[334:56.99]The beach level.
[335:00.51]Please reply.
[335:02.41]Please respond.
[335:03.75]I sent a message at least 10 minutes ago.
[335:09.30]Please respond.
[335:12.70]Alright.
[335:13.14]Well, these guns suck.
[335:20.06]Like, just terrible.
[335:22.82]They are lower level, but whatever.
[335:24.80]So, yeah, now I remember why you like the beach level.
[335:27.32]Because it drops a ton of things.
[335:28.80]Well, yeah, you get a shit ton of loot, and there's just so much stuff to fight.
[335:33.63]Are we playing the same game?
[335:36.61]I'm confused.
[335:37.21]What do you mean?
[335:40.35]This is EDF 5, right?
[335:42.46]Yeah.
[335:43.94]No, the beach level was different than the other one.
[335:45.50]Was it?
[335:47.08]I mean, they do kind of bleed together, but... Do you happen to know what... Did they change?
[335:55.65]I mean, it's definitely new stuff.
[335:59.24]No, this is very different, you dummy.
[336:02.02]I know, I'm just, I'm making a statement.
[336:03.92]Well, not very, I don't want to say it's very different, but yeah.
[336:07.61]I'm just making a statement.
[336:09.35]If the last one was EDF 4.1, this one's like 4.3.
[336:15.53]Hey, you don't know what's in the endgame.
[336:19.72]Could be anything.
[336:20.30]I'm not sure these are going very far.
[336:30.45]I'm gonna sneeze.
[336:34.76]I hope you're ready for it.
[336:36.42]I can't mute because... You heard the man.
[336:44.46]Hide behind the tanks.
[336:47.32]Let them handle it.
[336:48.78]Big boy job.
[336:57.00]That sounded like something in the game.
[336:59.23]Dude, if I don't get a new weapon this time, I'm going to complain about it and sound like a whining loser.
[337:07.17]Put it on the forums for the game.
[337:13.06]Forum.
[337:15.14]Complain to the devs, okay?
[337:16.28]They'll fix it before it becomes out of beta.
[337:17.82]I remember this level is... It goes pretty quick, though, doesn't it?
[337:21.73]So I have to be on top of this.
[337:23.83]I mean, there could be another wave.
[337:25.07]I don't know.
[337:28.35]I'm gonna need to move the fuck around.
[337:30.25]Because this level was just a shitload from... It's pretty similar.
[337:36.19]I'm very stuck.
[337:39.59]Honestly, it... No, it's not the same map, but like... We're clearly trying to be the same mission.
[337:51.03]I will let you get that gun, because it's very far away.
[337:53.88]I'm just kind of skating around.
[337:56.00]Collecting the things that I can get.
[337:58.97]It's over!
[338:02.31]Okay, so how do I do the full song?
[338:05.99]Of what song?
[338:07.75]Apparently, there's a full song.
[338:10.79]If you do it around other soldiers, they sing it with you.
[338:13.31]Uh-oh, I ran out of power.
[338:15.59]I think it might be in the gesture D-pad options.
[338:20.88]This is probably a bad time for this.
[338:24.32]I can't move.
[338:28.82]Hey, I think I got most of them.
[338:31.18]Yeah, I deserve that.
[338:32.62]I don't know why not.
[338:35.16]I deserve it.
[338:37.16]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[338:41.16]Holy shit.
[338:42.62]That was... Oh my goodness, that was a lot.
[338:46.79]Oh, it happened again.
[338:51.31]I got hit again.
[338:52.11]Oh.
[339:03.77]You can get in the mech if you want.
[339:05.05]I'm calling a lot of airstrikes.
[339:09.09]Oh!
[339:09.51]Okay, I need to get some shit.
[339:10.99]Ooh, don't grab me.
[339:13.73]He's right above me!
[339:14.55]Ooh!
[339:14.99]Yes, it is.
[339:15.65]I'm going back to the beach to collect
[339:34.73]Yeah, make sure you persist.
[339:35.89]I'm being very persistent on my collection.
[339:46.40]One of the classes does just kind of call airstrikes.
[339:50.15]What do we have for a standard weapon?
[339:52.01]Do you have a standard weapon?
[339:55.09]They have the Limpet guns, which is like you shoot detonatable explosives.
[340:00.00]and they have like smaller airstrikes they can call in like individual ones that reload pretty quickly but uh the way the airstrikes work is when they take points to call in and you get points from killing things so these missions where there's like a thousand ants like every airstrike refills your airstrike that's cool that's very cool
[340:27.11]Alright.
[340:27.75]I think I got most of them all.
[340:28.95]I'm having a bunch of these, like, flying girls dancing, like, flying all over my giant neck saying, party time.
[340:34.37]Wow.
[340:35.95]I'm married, and it's really hard right now.
[340:39.77]Is it?
[340:40.11]Yeah.
[340:45.79]Well, see if Ashley wants to get in on it.
[340:51.59]You know that she doesn't.
[340:52.83]She never does.
[340:53.40]Aye, aye, aye.
[340:57.19]Look at all those weapons I got for us.
[340:58.91]Do you see how many I picked up?
[341:03.13]Uh-oh, I got, I got some, it says new.
[341:06.91]I got new stuff for other classes.
[341:09.23]So did I. But it's like the same thing.
[341:11.78]All level zeros though, but some level ups.
[341:20.56]Please unmute your microphone.
[341:24.39]Your microphone is muted.
[341:27.55]I'm going to mute you.
[341:33.09]Surprise attack at night.
[341:36.46]Bolt gun.
[341:37.22]Do you want to do that one again?
[341:41.08]I think we're fighting frogs this time, for the record.
[341:44.26]Okay.
[341:45.18]I got a pretty good frog killer.
[341:47.61]I don't.
[341:50.77]Radius that's better missile opportunity.
[341:55.00]Hmm.
[341:56.58]I think I'm gonna use that Plasma cannon B. I don't like a plasma cannon B. I just don't I'm sorry.
[342:12.73]I Do want to use with the power lance, right?
[342:19.14]Oh Yeah power lance me
[342:22.03]What?
[342:23.97]Yeah, it was Power Lens, I'm thinking of.
[342:26.65]I mean, I have a shitty version of it, but it was really good.
[342:30.33]Oh, dude, the Suppress Gun!
[342:33.89]And then the... Grit Shot.
[342:35.37]116, 118... Let's get some more flight, what do you say?
[342:52.54]Jerma, there's a technical issue.
[342:54.78]Please tell me what it is, and I will try to fix it.
[343:03.11]Jerma, wake up.
[343:05.79]Spiders?
[343:07.75]Spiders?
[343:08.97]Your shoes are untied.
[343:10.11]I'm not wearing shoes.
[343:13.11]Oh my god.
[343:14.47]This is ugly.
[343:15.09]Oh, I thought we were indoors or something.
[343:16.61]I had a whole bunch of airstrikes.
[343:18.61]What are we doing up here?
[343:19.69]I don't know.
[343:20.39]This is a very ugly mission, though.
[343:23.24]Well, it's nighttime, so... Oh, I see a load of fucking frogs.
[343:29.58]I don't have any booster.
[343:30.96]What do I do?
[343:31.30]They're just, like, sitting over here.
[343:33.98]They're just... This is their natural habitat, man.
[343:40.59]All the way down.
[343:41.23]I've destroyed all the industry.
[343:43.33]Mission complete.
[343:43.95]Let's see if we can lock on.
[343:54.23]That was pretty cool.
[343:56.99]You want to be closer to that?
[343:57.99]Yeah.
[344:03.61]God.
[344:03.87]Oh, my God.
[344:04.13]Oh, my God.
[344:04.57]Oh, my God.
[344:05.93]Oh, I can't just stand still like that.
[344:08.21]Well, I guess he's dead because the rocket stopped.
[344:10.98]Yeah, it is midnight.
[344:13.36]It's too late.
[344:16.08]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[344:16.76]Growing red.
[344:17.32]I keep forgetting that you were two hours behind you.
[344:21.54]Yeah, but it's not.
[344:21.98]That means it's not even midnight.
[344:22.70]Yeah, that's why I was saying it's late.
[344:26.81]Oh, there they are.
[344:28.23]I haven't gotten to shoot at something yet.
[344:31.15]Well, then maybe you should try harder.
[344:33.81]It's pretty good.
[344:40.53]I lit that guy up.
[344:45.30]That guy's just rolling around.
[344:46.36]Can I luck on a two?
[344:51.04]Okay, there might be a few too many people here.
[344:56.48]Dead.
[344:58.02]I'm gonna hit this air shot.
[344:59.53]I want a better version of this.
[345:01.43]I want this thing at level 3 or something.
[345:05.19]Yeah, this one with even more rockets would be amazing.
[345:08.25]This thing is so good against these guys in the head.
[345:15.13]Pow.
[345:17.36]Here come a lot more of these.
[345:19.96]No, I want a better version.
[345:26.81]What the fuck is happening?
[345:34.09]Oh dear.
[345:34.41]Alright, I'm not going over there.
[345:39.52]Watch out.
[345:39.86]You guys can explode wherever you want.
[345:41.20]Can you believe how good this guy is?
[345:55.00]whoa that didn't look good alright I'm gonna go collect have fun have fun kids what was that other game we played a long time ago where you had like somebody always had to go gather stuff every few seconds like there was always someone in charge of going together someone had a machine it probably was man versus machine actually yeah you had to go like yeah yeah plenty of times played it we played it a bunch
[346:25.31]But I like to pick up the drops Don't kill me please Yeah, that's a scout when the scout everyone that's how you get money and the scout then gets healed and overhealed the more money Picks up Get out of the way
[346:54.06]I'm going to get the frog over here.
[346:57.54]I'm not saying a lot.
[346:58.44]There's a lot of frogs everywhere.
[346:59.80]There's one that's being annoying to me.
[347:01.66]This one.
[347:01.88]I'm getting this one.
[347:03.90]Get him.
[347:05.72]The one that was marked.
[347:07.32]The one that was just being annoying to me.
[347:09.16]I'm going to get this shot.
[347:15.97]That just makes me Randy.
[347:23.35]Oh yeah.
[347:24.85]Okay, I gotta back it up.
[347:29.29]Oh yeah, I'm dropping the bombs.
[347:30.71]This is bomb street.
[347:33.71]Bomb street.
[347:35.31]That was close.
[347:44.35]Air shot.
[347:44.85]Got it.
[347:46.96]Don't you even fucking talk to me about air shot.
[347:49.78]There's a giant frog behind us.
[347:51.10]Don't worry.
[347:52.22]I'm on the case.
[347:55.41]Oh, another frog.
[347:56.85]I'm on the case.
[347:57.29]I don't know where the hell he's going.
[348:01.20]It's hard for me to see anything right now when I'm circled by this red bubble.
[348:07.50]Okay, sorry for trying to help you.
[348:09.08]I'm going to die.
[348:10.84]Are you?
[348:13.00]I'll protect you.
[348:13.62]That guy just got fucking annihilated.
[348:24.47]I heard submarine.
[348:25.77]Yeah, it's unlikely they brought submarines with them.
[348:30.26]Well, they are from outer space.
[348:31.74]Didn't you hear him?
[348:32.26]He clarified that.
[348:33.08]He made sure you realized that.
[348:39.32]Such an overkill for a spider.
[348:42.22]Is it?
[348:42.94]Wouldn't you, like, have an orbital missile destroy a spider?
[348:46.09]Put the whole house down.
[348:47.07]I found one spider.
[348:52.73]Don't worry, Jerma.
[348:53.53]I've got them.
[348:55.45]There you go.
[348:58.99]He's already dead.
[349:00.39]He is dead.
[349:01.77]Uh-oh, lots of stuff to get.
[349:02.81]Uh-oh, and I don't have any power.
[349:04.13]Uh-oh.
[349:04.69]Uh-oh!
[349:07.67]Uh-oh!
[349:10.25]Uh-oh!
[349:20.52]No, no upgrades.
[349:21.24]Oh, wow, you're right.
[349:22.28]Oh, yes.
[349:23.12]I got the... Dude, I got the bulge laser.
[349:30.35]Level 20.
[349:30.61]This is surprise attack at night.
[349:34.43]Come see me.
[349:35.65]I got Bulge Laser.
[349:36.69]How you guys doing?
[349:38.13]You guys still down to play?
[349:39.60]You want to take a break?
[349:41.00]How are you doing?
[349:42.32]Dude, I want to use my Bulge Laser.
[349:44.52]I finally got a newbie gun.
[349:46.78]I'm just checking in on everybody to see how everybody's doing.
[349:50.42]But soon I probably want to stop.
[349:52.84]Okay.
[349:53.77]We found a giant building in the city.
[349:56.55]Please approach the building.
[349:58.09]Give me a level 2 or 3 or 5 of the Power Lance.
[350:01.01]It's like my favorite item right now.
[350:03.37]Ow.
[350:03.49]Ow.
[350:05.10]I wish you could, like, dust some of these items so you know.
[350:09.04]Alright, so we need to be able to kill buildings, I think.
[350:18.05]I don't have anything good.
[350:19.69]Kill buildings?
[350:20.97]Can you do the... Can we just try the... Wait, what class are you right now?
[350:24.03]Are we killing buildings?
[350:25.77]We can do it.
[350:26.91]Can we try the guide kit?
[350:28.57]Or are you not playing that class?
[350:30.11]No, no, no.
[350:30.95]I'll do it.
[350:31.65]I'll do it, boy.
[350:32.23]Okay.
[350:33.76]I'll get rid of my bomber so that you can shoot this one time and realize it's bad.
[350:38.80]It probably is bad.
[350:39.92]The lock-on time is 31 seconds.
[350:44.32]But it does 4,529 damage.
[350:45.18]Okay, now let's do that.
[350:46.44]I'm not bored.
[350:49.93]This is fucking awesome.
[350:52.13]Kill the building.
[350:54.55]We're playing with somebody right now that it's getting late for them, and we need to make sure that they're still ready to play.
[350:58.87]Who are you talking to?
[351:02.67]Oh, me and Jerma made a commitment to each other.
[351:06.37]I think I'm gonna, hold on, let me change one more thing.
[351:09.49]Look at the big cannon.
[351:11.27]Um, yes, me too.
[351:18.00]Actually, are you doing anything for, like, Christmas?
[351:19.78]Anyone doing Christmas with him?
[351:22.52]I'm coming over to your house.
[351:24.26]Are you?
[351:26.82]I'm going to your house for Christmas?
[351:29.16]Yeah.
[351:29.86]Alright, see you at your house!
[351:33.99]Christmas.
[351:35.37]Christmas?
[351:37.13]Christmas with the cranks.
[351:38.53]Isn't that a movie?
[351:44.87]Uh, probably.
[351:47.23]Would not surprise me.
[351:53.54]Oh my god.
[351:54.48]Well, I have the wrong loadout for this, but it's alright.
[352:01.12]I think we have to destroy the giant rob from Smash Bros.
[352:06.04]Oh, is this a UFO one?
[352:08.22]Yeah, I really don't have the stuff for this either.
[352:11.04]Yeah, I don't either.
[352:12.88]Here, let's at least try your thing.
[352:14.62]I'll put a laser on one of them.
[352:17.44]Well, it does 4000 damage.
[352:19.10]It should be on a larger than a single UFO.
[352:22.84]Don't you want to at least see it and then we can reset?
[352:30.55]This thing is really, really fucking good.
[352:33.59]I see it.
[352:34.09]I'm locking on.
[352:35.55]Don't kill it, guys.
[352:36.39]Don't kill what?
[352:37.33]I gotta wait 30 seconds to lock on to this.
[352:42.28]It's still locking.
[352:44.52]Hey, it's ready.
[352:45.62]There it goes.
[352:46.62]Missile away.
[352:48.76]That was a big missile.
[352:49.78]I think someone just blew it up.
[352:52.18]This thing is very good.
[352:59.31]No, it's running away.
[353:00.25]It just hit a building That thing was That was comically slow that really was that's the worst thing ever We get the high ground killed all those people Okay, we get to use it on this building up here
[353:21.99]Oh my God, what is shooting out here?
[353:24.93]I have my bulge laser.
[353:26.33]Watch out for the 5 million cannons all shooting at the same time.
[353:29.25]What is this lightning from Zeus?
[353:31.05]That's my bulge laser.
[353:33.51]The Zeus cannon.
[353:35.81]Look at these bubble lights.
[353:39.36]I mean, at this point, we're, like, completing this mission.
[353:42.78]Alright, mark one of those, like, forward cannons on the big machine.
[353:52.20]Are we even destroying them?
[353:53.81]I don't know, that's what we're advancing to.
[353:55.45]I think it's because of the cannons.
[354:00.75]They're all shooting.
[354:01.55]Yeah, give it 30 seconds.
[354:03.73]Alright, I'm going in.
[354:04.54]Hold on, there's too many insects.
[354:09.18]Oh, did you already lock on to something?
[354:10.96]Yeah.
[354:12.12]There's a lot more swarms coming in.
[354:14.98]Wait, you dropped it.
[354:15.89]I had to restart because you lost the laser.
[354:20.58]Still locking.
[354:22.22]Ready?
[354:23.20]And there's a mech in my way.
[354:25.04]Fire!
[354:25.38]Where are you firing towards?
[354:27.22]The cannons away?
[354:27.86]I don't know.
[354:28.20]Wherever he's marking.
[354:29.35]It's going.
[354:30.67]I'm getting to shoot one of those cannons.
[354:32.53]It's going.
[354:33.27]Which one?
[354:35.75]Where are the lasers pointing?
[354:36.74]It's on its way.
[354:37.56]It's wiggling around.
[354:40.46]Hopefully it goes down.
[354:44.66]I'm trying to get a good view.
[354:45.88]There it goes.
[354:48.44]I think it actually worked.
[354:50.74]I didn't even see it.
[354:52.31]It actually worked.
[354:53.17]It killed that whole turret.
[354:55.57]Let's do that.
[354:56.51]Another 30 seconds of that.
[354:58.33]Hey, I'm already over here.
[354:59.25]Don't worry.
[354:59.55]I'll get all the turrets.
[355:00.51]You guys just take care of them.
[355:01.31]You're going to get all the turrets?
[355:02.19]Watch this.
[355:02.55]Do you even have guns?
[355:03.75]Check it.
[355:04.61]Ready?
[355:04.83]Tell me when you're ready for me to paint.
[355:06.11]Or when you're painting.
[355:08.63]I'm not doing it.
[355:09.65]I'm doing my laser.
[355:10.45]I'm always working in firing my laser Don't worry guys boomer mean you take care of you you guys just stay you guys stay Well, hey you guys just say you don't you stay I go I Can't see far enough to get What is this pink?
[355:38.10]Is the pink what the other laser chases?
[355:42.16]Yeah, I'm pointing my laser, and it's going towards that.
[355:46.16]How inaccurate is this gun?
[355:49.32]Got it.
[355:51.26]Got bullet drop.
[355:53.58]What do you mean?
[355:55.74]Yes, it is.
[355:56.40]I'm shooting at it right now.
[355:57.40]There's a lot of these.
[356:00.18]It is, though.
[356:01.71]We've destroyed a lot of turrets.
[356:06.60]That was way too low.
[356:07.64]It's not working!
[356:08.78]You guess they mean, like, the whole building?
[356:12.68]I have no accuracy whatsoever.
[356:15.60]I can't even get up there.
[356:17.58]Is the big blazer shooting?
[356:19.88]No.
[356:27.72]Alright, all the turrets that are shooting in that direction are gone.
[356:30.96]There's a bunch shooting in the other direction, but the ones that are shooting towards you guys are all pretty much gone.
[356:37.70]It's gonna take me ten years to get over here.
[356:39.62]I don't even know if I can get up there.
[356:43.64]I'd say two won't.
[356:46.42]Shit, what about the big cannon?
[356:47.54]Should we be aiming at that?
[356:52.81]I wonder how effective that is.
[356:58.87]Are you kidding me?
[357:03.72]How are you- where are you guys at?
[357:08.80]Well, attack.
[357:10.50]Uh oh.
[357:12.09]Yeah, I can't get up there.
[357:14.35]Well, here they come.
[357:15.81]What is it trying to make me look at?
[357:17.73]Drones.
[357:19.95]A lot of them.
[357:22.79]Holy shit.
[357:26.80]Okay.
[357:30.02]I'm going to try to take out all the saucers that just came out.
[357:41.36]Give him the bulge.
[357:47.96]Cause it is one hit with this.
[357:51.34]Holy shit, what the fuck is firing right now?
[357:56.75]Uh, what are you talking about?
[357:58.49]A giant laser beam just came out of the sky.
[358:00.49]Jesus Christ, Jerma.
[358:03.05]That was like the first thing I asked when we started this mission, but yeah.
[358:06.91]What?
[358:09.30]I've been away from you guys the entire time.
[358:11.50]I have like a targetable laser.
[358:14.46]Yeah, but it is a giant purple beam coming down from the sky, so it's not like the view distance is... I've been taken out.
[358:21.25]I didn't mean to say thanks.
[358:23.39]Oh, he's been so busy being productive.
[358:25.51]Oh, yeah.
[358:26.13]What do you think?
[358:27.25]The cannons just disappeared on their own?
[358:30.13]We killed like two of them, just the two of us.
[358:32.19]Well, great.
[358:32.77]I killed 14.
[358:35.05]Look, it's only because you're faster, not because you're stronger, okay?
[358:37.97]Can't wait to see your new movie that comes out soon.
[358:41.55]Faster, not stronger, what?
[358:42.67]Is that the movie?
[358:43.36]It's called the Sonic the Hedgehog movie.
[358:45.60]All about you.
[358:46.18]What the hell is that?
[358:55.08]What the hell is what?
[358:57.91]Been asking that the whole game.
[359:04.89]Uh-oh, giant cannons.
[359:09.91]Jeremy, you didn't even destroy those?
[359:11.71]I can't.
[359:13.19]Can you not destroy the big turrets?
[359:14.85]I don't think so.
[359:15.47]Not alone.
[359:18.71]No, this is just that we have to... Well, we got the retreat order, which means you win.
[359:21.83]Yeah, we won.
[359:24.76]It looks like you can hurt them.
[359:27.00]And then I'm doing damage to it.
[359:31.34]He's here?
[359:32.00]All back.
[359:43.60]Is it dying or are we dying?
[359:46.41]That's a great question.
[359:48.69]Hey, wave three.
[359:49.65]Oh my god.
[359:51.21]Shoot down the drones.
[359:52.01]Any other requests?
[360:07.99]Okay, he did have another request as it happens.
[360:12.20]Yeah, shoot down the drones.
[360:14.76]Oh my god.
[360:18.86]I'm getting... How is that, like, Zeus laser working out?
[360:22.56]Eh.
[360:23.64]Speaking of shit, I need to... I gotta go collect.
[360:26.66]Go get those... Yeah, I am dead.
[360:33.05]No, I'm dead.
[360:33.85]You can't be dead because I am.
[360:38.04]I'm fairly close to you, though.
[360:41.19]You guys doing okay?
[360:42.43]I'm not.
[360:44.43]I'm wiggling around.
[360:53.62]I hear your screams.
[360:54.62]What bothers me is it's a different voice each time.
[360:57.60]Yeah.
[360:59.57]But that's what I also like the most about it.
[361:02.34]Yeah, but there's some viewers in here now from six hours ago, so they haven't heard it before.
[361:11.74]I've had the same amount of viewers the whole time I've been streaming.
[361:15.73]Yeah, but they're different ones.
[361:18.31]No, they're the same people.
[361:19.79]People don't leave my stream.
[361:23.63]I mean, like, your viewers are probably, like, a lot less loyal.
[361:25.69]Yeah.
[361:31.91]My viewers don't leave my stream or else I ban them.
[361:39.00]The ones who are still here are just the ones who didn't get banned yet.
[361:41.18]Star, why do you have to be so mean?
[361:43.22]Is there any reason for that?
[361:44.12]That wasn't mean.
[361:47.66]That was a direct attack.
[361:51.01]That was a direct attack.
[361:53.87]Two Etalyx.
[361:56.77]It was a direct mean comment.
[361:59.37]Alright, let me get the rest of this.
[362:01.28]Listen, I don't need anyone to defend me.
[362:04.88]You do.
[362:05.24]I'm not going to his Christmas party anymore.
[362:14.66]I would have loved a real answer about where you're going for Christmas, but you don't respect me enough, I guess.
[362:20.79]I don't think anyone's going anywhere.
[362:24.39]It's a sad truth.
[362:27.20]I think we did it.
[362:28.98]There's two ants on top of this laser and that's it.
[362:31.64]Alright, let me just make sure I got most of the stuff.
[362:39.15]Let me go back here.
[362:39.97]I think you gotta kill those two ants.
[362:45.53]I do, but I just wanted to take a quick look to see.
[362:48.39]Make sure I didn't leave any boxes.
[362:51.31]Can we kill these purple turrets?
[362:54.44]Yes, you can.
[362:58.32]I see one box that I didn't get down here.
[363:01.52]Two, actually.
[363:06.72]I guess I don't need to anymore.
[363:13.48]Ah, I got it!
[363:14.18]Come on.
[363:15.10]Come on, Etalyx.
[363:17.04]What?
[363:18.00]Come on, I just abused her.
[363:25.87]Just one more damage.
[363:27.83]Come on.
[363:29.59]Hey, no new weapons.
[363:30.69]Wow, did you curse me?
[363:32.39]We're fighting pylons in the mountains.
[363:39.02]Okay.
[363:41.62]Let's see.
[363:46.74]Why six?
[363:50.14]I'll try it.
[363:50.78]I said pylons, right?
[363:55.40]I didn't say pylons.
[363:56.66]I didn't say pylons.
[363:58.22]I didn't say pylons.
[364:01.22]Oh, we can use rank seven stuff now.
[364:08.34]Hey, flaunt it if you got it.
[364:11.72]Put this back on.
[364:12.26]Alright.
[364:15.86]How do you kill pylons with missile launchers?
[364:18.64]Can you lock on with missile launcher?
[364:22.45]Yeah.
[364:25.99]Well, I mean, I have missiles that don't require that.
[364:34.79]Yeah, sure.
[364:35.41]Yeah, sure.
[364:36.05]Yeah, sure.
[364:36.83]Oh, yeah, sure.
[364:37.93]Oh, yeah.
[364:38.61]Go back to Club Penguin.
[364:45.65]No, we're not playing Club Penguin.
[364:54.64]Hmm.
[364:56.43]Are you kissing yourself?
[364:57.85]All the sad faces.
[364:59.89]Yeah.
[365:01.57]What drinks do you guys drink?
[365:03.29]Coke.
[365:04.19]Like your average drink.
[365:06.25]Water.
[365:08.47]Probably.
[365:10.13]Water.
[365:12.72]Coke.
[365:14.16]Coffee.
[365:14.62]That's a lot of pylons.
[365:18.20]Those are the three things I said, yeah.
[365:21.26]You guys are like the same.
[365:22.64]Well, you answered that, and I answered it because we're different people.
[365:26.79]So it could be different.
[365:29.25]I should have got air strikes.
[365:32.57]And you're like there already.
[365:34.55]I drank a lot of green juice too, though.
[365:41.34]Two hits to kill these things.
[365:54.88]You know, I'm a fan of green smoothies.
[365:59.68]Just like, green Gatorade, I like green smoothies, I like green shakes.
[366:04.33]Is there anything green, really?
[366:06.97]Yeah.
[366:07.73]That's pretty accurate.
[366:10.11]There are frogs.
[366:13.15]This just reminds me of The Scholar of the Lost Sins.
[366:16.92]Whatever it's called.
[366:17.54]There's just enemies fucking everywhere in random places.
[366:24.75]Enemies everywhere.
[366:26.33]There are.
[366:27.21]I can't see any enemies because you can fly.
[366:31.61]Leave me to the pylons.
[366:33.09]Okay.
[366:34.55]I got all my stuff as pylon shoots.
[366:38.03]Yeah, I can just kind of sit back here and just kill pylons, actually.
[366:46.27]I'm pretty good at it.
[366:53.86]Except that one.
[366:58.84]Actually pushing me down the hill.
[367:03.47]I'm out of ammo.
[367:09.21]Let me get a little closer.
[367:12.97]I need more fuel or I'm not going to be able to do anything.
[367:18.31]Dude, he's not dead.
[367:22.39]I bet he wishes he was.
[367:25.10]I'm gonna drop the bomb.
[367:26.94]Yep.
[367:27.24]Those pylons will be called teleportation anchors.
[367:30.72]Lots of armor, Sid.
[367:32.14]Why are we naming the pylons now?
[367:35.72]What are they called now?
[367:37.20]Teleportation anchors.
[367:39.44]Is what you just said.
[367:40.28]We're calling them that now.
[367:41.19]Well, she's been calling them pylons.
[367:42.37]They've been saying pylons the whole game.
[367:43.57]Well, no.
[367:45.03]They're not called that anymore.
[367:45.97]Now they're called teleportation anchors.
[367:48.13]Well, they needed to research it for a few weeks.
[367:50.23]We needed to change the name because it was offending some people.
[367:56.02]How?
[367:58.52]He was insensitive.
[368:06.26]I'm summoning a grape.
[368:08.20]Grapes?
[368:08.62]Mmm!
[368:08.90]Do you like frozen grapes?
[368:12.18]No.
[368:12.60]Thanks.
[368:13.00]No.
[368:13.22]They ain't no friend to me.
[368:14.26]I've never had one.
[368:21.22]Alright, red ants.
[368:22.44]Careful.
[368:23.34]Don't get grabbed.
[368:25.66]You must construct additional teleportation.
[368:27.94]It's a good one, chat.
[368:40.66]Boom.
[368:41.63]No, he didn't explode?
[368:42.63]What?
[368:49.99]This gun's actually really good for this mission.
[368:54.28]I am just the sniper now.
[368:55.82]I'll puke.
[368:57.72]See if I can shoot him in the face.
[369:02.26]No, I'm not going in that far.
[369:03.60]No, I'm not going in that far.
[369:05.16]That fast.
[369:05.56]That would be bad.
[369:11.03]Are you in an APC?
[369:12.77]Oh, yeah.
[369:13.87]Can I get an APC as a mech boy?
[369:16.45]You can get in the back, but you cannot drive it.
[369:18.63]That felt good.
[369:23.39]I mean, I think that happens in one movie I've ever seen in my life.
[369:36.63]Oh, God.
[369:38.62]F4 guy.
[369:43.10]Hey, it's okay.
[369:43.60]They're not immune like us.
[369:46.68]Um, Atonix, you want to go to the APC?
[369:48.80]I'll drive you.
[369:51.13]I need to pick up weapons.
[369:53.21]I haven't been doing it.
[369:54.01]I guess there's not anything back there.
[369:58.89]Wait.
[370:00.79]Okay, we're good.
[370:02.27]We're in.
[370:04.73]Wish I had like a proper window.
[370:07.59]Nope.
[370:08.77]This is as good as it gets.
[370:11.68]More bad guys this way.
[370:13.90]We're graping it.
[370:15.12]But yeah, that comment made even less sense when you consider one third of the monsters are literally frogs.
[370:23.62]they're gonna die when it rains oh boy that was a hole in one I'm gonna stay up here and land them there's a lot of things over there whoa hold on Etalyx
[370:47.42]I think I'm gonna get out of here.
[370:48.94]Come on!
[370:49.93]It's so fun to watch just the long range.
[370:52.33]It's like I'm playing Tribes Ascend.
[370:55.99]But with way more players.
[371:00.38]Wow.
[371:00.84]Yeah, this game's not dead.
[371:03.40]Actually, that's not even... Didn't Highbrow say, now we're done?
[371:09.78]Something like that, right?
[371:11.91]Basically.
[371:13.64]Very impressive.
[371:15.07]For a newbie.
[371:17.05]Dude, stop calling me a newbie.
[371:18.43]Here it is again.
[371:19.87]For a newbie.
[371:21.91]Uh-oh.
[371:26.41]I'm being eaten.
[371:27.65]I am also being eaten.
[371:28.69]You are both being eaten.
[371:32.37]I can't see a thing.
[371:35.91]And the only thing that I can do is have artillery shoot this ant.
[371:39.62]I'm coming.
[371:44.41]Rescued.
[371:44.99]Boom.
[371:53.19]I love the boom.
[371:56.46]Here comes the boom.
[371:57.90]Ready or not.
[372:04.32]Well, that's because you're a boomer.
[372:06.20]Please lock on.
[372:07.46]What is shooting me?
[372:09.39]There's a lot behind.
[372:10.17]Oh, my God.
[372:11.43]They're coming down from the road.
[372:13.27]Watch out.
[372:13.71]They're all going to be pouring down here.
[372:20.54]That was not worth it.
[372:24.80]I'm going to go up.
[372:32.06]Ay, ay, ay.
[372:34.24]There's too many of them.
[372:35.02]I'm going in.
[372:36.35]I'm going in.
[372:38.52]I'm gonna go for a frog kill.
[372:41.22]What's even the objective here?
[372:42.66]Oh, there's a bunch of frogs, yeah.
[372:43.70]The pylons.
[372:45.28]Yeah, uh, who are we supposed to be on the pylons?
[372:47.23]This guy's just sitting on, like, a fucking couch watching me.
[372:50.77]I was supposed to be on the pylons.
[372:54.55]But I was being attacked by ants who were eating.
[372:56.77]Oh.
[372:57.82]So who's on ants?
[372:59.12]Oh, vert ramp!
[372:59.78]Yeah! 21!
[373:05.78]This thing kills in less shots than the plasma rifle does.
[373:09.34]One down.
[373:11.22]Next one on the way, guys.
[373:12.58]Any more of these?
[373:14.14]Damn it, I missed.
[373:21.67]I'm comboing them.
[373:22.37]I'm comboing them.
[373:22.89]You won't land.
[373:23.39]I'm comboing them.
[373:26.99]There it is.
[373:29.65]Oh, there's a lot going on over there.
[373:30.73]Hey, that was pretty good for a newbie.
[373:31.79]...businesses are shutting down, which leads to lower employment rate.
[373:36.12]I'm dead.
[373:40.63]Hey, the employment rate is going to go way down when every business is destroyed on Earth.
[373:46.21]Oh, there are lots.
[373:53.44]The employment rate's going down with all the dead people.
[373:58.66]Morticianers.
[373:59.48]You're alive.
[373:59.80]You're alive.
[374:00.32]They're doing great.
[374:02.84]Mortician.
[374:04.05]Army jobs way up.
[374:07.27]Also way down when they die.
[374:11.27]Turnover rate's really high.
[374:12.51]Ooh, look out.
[374:24.16]Did he just Gandalf that fucking ant?
[374:26.38]He just Gandalf that ant.
[374:28.46]Yeah, I went... No, no, you... The marine went, You shall not pass!
[374:40.39]Dude, I'm so ready to use my ult.
[374:47.89]Someone just said, log out.
[374:49.56]Wait, why?
[374:52.64]Dude, just fucking log out already.
[374:54.24]I mean... I don't disagree.
[374:59.12]Hey, uninstall, okay?
[375:00.90]You're so bad, uninstall.
[375:03.68]His name is Radagast LeBron.
[375:06.38]And he's not even good.
[375:08.19]He's not even good.
[375:16.49]Come on, Grape.
[375:18.29]I'll get this last one.
[375:18.93]Let me get this last one.
[375:19.73]I need this.
[375:20.37]Come on.
[375:30.00]Damn it!
[375:30.54]Let me get this.
[375:32.94]Don't touch him.
[375:33.42]Don't touch him!

[376:04.64]So this is the A1.
[376:17.32]Uh, it says alien ships are... I think this is... Yeah, this is like ships and people landing.
[376:22.90]I'm putting this one back on.
[376:24.68]Yeah, the frogs are doing their landing thing.
[376:28.38]I love a flamethrower.
[376:29.96]Look at the range of the increase here.
[376:35.41]Okay.
[376:38.13]Um... What else did I get?
[376:45.01]Vibro Roller.
[376:53.17]I don't.
[376:54.22]But by the way, we definitely can't stop on this one because it's level 23.
[376:59.10]Just to let you guys know.
[377:00.78]What does that mean?
[377:01.90]23 is the devil's number.
[377:04.78]Oh.
[377:05.18]Yeah, we can't stop here then.
[377:08.55]I remember that.
[377:09.25]Now that you bring it up about the devil.
[377:11.77]Am I doing Ranger this level?
[377:15.61]I don't know.
[377:24.29]I think all my shit still sucks.
[377:31.83]What's happening?
[377:32.81]Oh god.
[377:33.29]Are there any mods around to figure out what just happened?
[377:42.68]Hey, what just happened guys?
[377:43.94]I think somebody linked porn.
[377:49.92]Is it safe to work porn?
[377:52.38]How did you, how do you accidentally do that?
[377:55.95]If it was safe for work, then, you know.
[377:57.97]Accidentally linked porn.
[378:00.83]Well, he thought he had something else copied.
[378:10.39]He thought he had something else copied and you, and you, and you, what, Ctrl V'd entered?
[378:19.33]not gonna lie I almost did that in Ster chat once what how how do you accidentally have porn copy like that would insinuate that you like what are you copying it for are you sharing it with friends look at this thing how does this work where is the ship oh
[378:45.35]Oh my god, I want pizza.
[378:47.85]Don't say that.
[378:48.57]Oh my god, I want pizza.
[378:50.01]Stop saying pizza.
[378:52.13]You're making a lot of people angry right now, especially me.
[378:54.57]Oh my god, I want pizza.
[378:59.74]I don't understand how this works, but okay.
[379:05.70]Wait, you don't share porn with your friends?
[379:07.22]I keep it all to myself.
[379:11.43]This is a must watch.
[379:14.85]I gotta copy that one for later.
[379:16.63]Alright, you stay.
[379:18.31]Are you saying you do that?
[379:19.41]You stay out of my room.
[379:20.27]Because you never shared anything with me.
[379:23.67]Well, I didn't know.
[379:24.37]I didn't... I didn't know.
[379:27.11]This takes like three minutes to warm up, but when it does... It just goes.
[379:36.42]I thought you meant the porn you were linking.
[379:37.96]It takes like three minutes for you to get into it, but man.
[379:40.82]Yeah, there's no storyline.
[379:45.05]Alright, you gotta watch the beginning.
[379:46.47]I really recommend the storyline, though.
[379:50.25]Listen, the writers for this were the same as the writers for the last one.
[379:53.07]I mean, you mentioned pizzas.
[379:57.86]It's okay, it got me on this workplace.
[380:04.74]Man, I really do want pizza, so... Yeah, I just ate pizza and I want pizza.
[380:10.22]I ate pizza yesterday.
[380:11.34]I think it's still open.
[380:14.08]for me by, like, another, like, 20 minutes.
[380:18.24]Nope.
[380:20.44]I mean, like, you guys got this covered, right?
[380:22.58]No, this is number 23!
[380:24.68]We can't!
[380:25.16]I mean, you guys got this covered.
[380:27.66]I could just order this pizza.
[380:30.60]Oh, okay, you're gonna order the pizza.
[380:33.23]I see what you're saying.
[380:33.99]Okay.
[380:37.69]Man, this stream really got off the rails at 1am.
[380:42.17]Yeah, this is just one of those chill streams where we just hang out, talk about pizza, talk about porn.
[380:50.94]Porn, pizza, we got it all here.
[380:52.74]Yeah, we got it all.
[380:53.32]Hey guys, just doing a quick vlog.
[380:54.50]I just had a few things in my mind.
[380:56.88]Felt like talking about them.
[380:58.44]Somebody that understands me.
[380:59.78]I'm putting... Listen.
[381:02.77]Wait, how do I undo that?
[381:03.75]This would be the worst way to die.
[381:04.93]I'm sorry, it would.
[381:06.63]Why is this frog stuck to this building?
[381:10.73]This is a meat lovers.
[381:12.95]Name your pizza.
[381:14.53]Does this do anything?
[381:16.41]No thanks.
[381:18.01]What, you named it no thanks?
[381:20.31]No, I clicked no thanks.
[381:21.31]I don't want to name it.
[381:22.79]Like, what if they can see what I name it?
[381:25.60]Like, if I call it, like, the Big Dough Burster.
[381:28.28]Like, that's creepy.
[381:33.72]I think no thanks is funny, though.
[381:35.74]If you write no thanks, that's like an insult to whoever has to look at that.
[381:41.58]Oh, man, I don't...
[381:43.84]Wait, where- I wanna set this guy on fire!
[381:46.12]Like, uh, hey, what's the name of this guy's pizza?
[381:47.98]No thanks.
[381:48.58]Like, okay, dick.
[381:51.42]Wait, wait, I- I frickin'... I'll be right back.
[381:56.29]Everyone's really enjoying the view on my stream here.
[381:58.17]I'll go, like, there.
[381:59.71]Now you can see what's happening.
[382:01.07]Get a nice crotch shot.
[382:04.81]Pizza is so delicious.
[382:07.04]I- Oh my god.
[382:12.39]I really might just not even care and eat pizza tonight.
[382:16.54]I can sense what's going on in your mind's eye.
[382:19.48]I haven't had like real pizza in like three months.
[382:21.88]I don't even think I care.
[382:23.78]I think I'm gonna eat pizza.
[382:25.90]We have red frogs here.
[382:28.19]Wow, guy's gonna eat pizza and doesn't even care.
[382:32.31]out of context that's like okay you're gonna eat pizza tonight alright what's you don't even care I've been such a good boy I haven't eaten pizza in so long but you know tonight I'm really gonna let myself go what a rebel he's gonna eat pizza okay this is taking so long but the moment Ashley had the opportunity she stole my credit card and it's like all wet

[383:08.85]I didn't do it.
[383:09.35]We have a super frog here.
[383:10.57]You understand?
[383:11.05]This is a super frog and we're dying.
[383:13.90]She's screaming, I'm dead.
[383:15.82]Thanks a lot.
[383:16.50]Thanks a lot for going to get your pizza.
[383:18.30]Hopefully it's a good pizza.
[383:19.24]I hope the dough blaster is good.
[383:23.40]I'm not going to make it.
[383:24.80]Honestly, Jerma?
[383:25.64]I hope you open it up and sit on it.
[383:30.10]Why would I do that?
[383:31.56]Sit on the pizza?
[383:32.34]Let's keep this safe for work.
[383:42.75]The store is closed.
[383:45.45]That's not funny.
[383:46.11]That sucks.
[383:46.85]I'm sorry.
[383:47.31]You can't get food.
[383:47.99]That's not cool.

[384:50.26]Let's go back to New York.
[384:52.00]New York City.
[384:57.42]Somebody just wrote... I love this shit, man.
[384:59.60]Somebody just wrote... Hey, uh, Peter.
[385:06.06]What?
[385:06.78]It's like there's... Nobody said it.
[385:10.95]Hey, uh, Peter.
[385:13.97]You said it.
[385:14.43]I didn't say it, though.
[385:15.81]Everywhere's closed.
[385:16.97]There's no food.
[385:20.29]They said it.
[385:21.41]There was no... But you said it.
[385:25.48]I didn't just say it.
[385:26.26]We were talking about pizza.
[385:29.49]So what is... Somebody just wrote, hey, beat her.
[385:33.47]Like, is that a pizza reference?
[385:34.58]No, that's a joke from fucking Family Guy.
[385:37.80]So you, but your excuse was we were just talking about pizza.
[385:40.58]Yeah, but somebody just wrote in the chat, hey, beat her.
[385:45.52]You can't, Alex, you can't, you can't have to be there.
[385:49.67]I feel like, I, am I?
[385:51.13]I don't really get this guy.
[385:53.65]You are here.
[385:54.35]I think I am here.
[385:56.21]Yeah.
[385:58.38]This happened while I was here.
[385:59.84]Yeah, this happened when you were right here.
[386:06.82]But they wrote it with a B. That's why it was funny, right?
[386:08.94]No, but you don't... You had to be there.
[386:11.59]You had to be there like a year ago.
[386:14.13]No, you don't... You had to be there like a year ago.
[386:19.35]Oh, God.
[386:28.96]Yeah, you had to be there, Peter.
[386:30.52]Yeah, you had to be there.
[386:38.37]I don't get it.
[386:40.47]It's alright.
[386:41.65]Why is this guy shooting to me from a reclined position?
[386:45.82]He was just lying down comfortably while also sniping me.
[386:50.82]Isn't that what you're doing right now, though?
[386:52.59]Come on, this is just like, uh, this is just us.
[386:55.79]We are these fucking frogs just lying on our, sitting on our asses, shooting.
[386:59.31]I mean, I'm inside of a mech suit, sort of.
[387:02.85]I'm kind of crying about this pizza, like, there's actual tears.
[387:07.72]It doesn't sound like I'm crying, but... Crying on the inside.
[387:11.90]See, they're just like humans.
[387:16.56]Oh my god, Natalix.
[387:17.70]Did you just mark me?
[387:19.50]Yeah.
[387:20.88]Thank you.
[387:22.58]Come on, land it right in the chest.
[387:29.84]Come on.
[387:30.31]Can someone make me a pizza?
[387:32.03]Like someone in one of these chats has to be able to make me a pizza.
[387:34.67]Make me a pizza!
[387:37.31]Something on that I don't like.
[387:42.81]Something Moscow!
[387:46.39]I don't think this weapon's very good.
[387:48.46]There's a mine melter.
[388:02.54]Hiya.
[388:10.00]What am I gonna do?
[388:13.36]We can't end on this mission.
[388:14.58]Satan will get us.
[388:15.50]Satan's gonna get you if you end on 23.
[388:18.82]We'll end on 24.
[388:19.72]That's not how many hours are in a day.
[388:29.93]That's how long the stream has been.
[388:33.07]So it was what?
[388:33.63]There was a super frog?
[388:35.75]Yeah, there is a red super frog.
[388:37.35]They really are just reclining.
[388:40.84]Eventually, there's a red super frog.
[388:43.44]I don't believe you.
[388:51.44]There it is.
[388:52.35]You didn't see it.
[388:54.99]Oh boy.
[388:55.71]Yeah, I chose the wrong weapon for this.
[388:58.09]My chainsaw axes are not doing so good.
[389:03.17]We've opened fire.
[389:09.83]Here they come.
[389:13.85]At the top of the building before I lose it all!
[389:16.91]I got it.
[389:17.19]Are they giving friendly fire?
[389:21.74]I can aim from down here.
[389:22.62]This should be good.
[389:26.82]My deflection shield, I'm still taking damage through.
[389:30.40]This would suck.
[389:31.49]Oh, that sucks.
[389:34.67]Oh, you knocked the building down.
[389:37.94]Oh, she had to bring race into the fucking invasion?
[389:44.02]You're just full of fucking... You're just... She said it!
[389:48.29]Like, why did you have to pull a race card on this?
[389:51.59]I think she was just saying that the red frogs were here.
[389:55.89]I'm dead.
[390:05.97]Well, why didn't you use your dialogue, Vitalik?
[390:08.89]I tried using my shield, but it doesn't block me.
[390:12.39]You should've used your words then.
[390:13.97]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, don't worry.
[390:16.23]See, I'm a good teammate, and I'm gonna help you.
[390:18.11]He's a fucking pizza sitter.
[390:26.60]You would've done the same thing.
[390:30.80]See, there's the red one.
[390:32.64]Although some people expect dialogues, that's not what we're seeing on the scene.
[390:36.06]That's not what we're seeing on the scene.
[390:39.50]No, that's not.
[390:40.41]You do not see the dialogue, you hear it with your... Hard.
[390:44.55]Holy shit.
[390:45.03]There are millions dying every second.
[390:46.55]You just annihilated this frog.
[390:49.87]That was almost sad.
[390:52.51]I feel bad for the frog that you just unloaded.
[390:54.63]You feel bad for Frogman?
[390:56.63]Last second weapon.
[390:58.55]Didn't even matter.
[390:59.49]Holy shit.
[391:00.55]Oh, I got the blacker.
[391:01.95]Okay, let's see.
[391:08.28]Wait, wait.
[391:08.90]It's an aerator tank.
[391:10.08]I thought I couldn't get tanks.
[391:11.34]24.
[391:13.84]I thought that was rangers.
[391:16.61]I want to replace one of these.
[391:18.19]Alright, so this is the last one?
[391:19.97]Oh no, I can get them too.
[391:21.25]Last one for the night?
[391:23.05]Don't say this is the last one.
[391:24.45]And then you can go do whatever you wanted to do?
[391:28.74]I'm just trying to gauge what you just said.
[391:32.00]We'll gauge it when the mission's over.
[391:33.66]Because I just got the blacker.
[391:35.44]Okay.
[391:36.86]Okay.
[391:37.66]Alright.
[391:38.72]Double co-op Jupiter.
[391:41.72]That was an ultimate co-op Jupiter.
[391:45.99]No!
[391:46.67]It's impossible!
[391:47.55]I mean, like, seriously.
[391:48.43]I can't believe somebody actually got it.
[391:54.29]Uh, I don't wanna use these.
[391:58.52]Mmm, I'll use the lightning gun, and then... I wonder... I'll go back to this, this is fun.
[392:14.72]I'm sick of being ready first all the time.
[392:19.24]I was here.
[392:20.66]I was here for the co-op Jupiter.
[392:33.81]Alright.
[392:35.07]Bingo.
[392:38.23]How far does that go?
[392:42.70]Not far enough.
[392:45.72]Oh boy, this looks like it's gonna be tough.
[392:54.27]Can this tank go?
[392:58.27]Shreds.
[393:01.45]Hey, look at me, guys.

[395:59.81]Oh, my God.
[396:00.47]It doesn't drive like other things drive.
[396:02.15]And suddenly I begin to see there's a new life for me because I got a golden ticket.
[396:11.03]It's ours, Charlie.
[396:13.37]Don't do it, Tom, what are you doing?
[396:15.85]Shut the fuck up!
[396:21.30]Listen, it's a good song.
[396:32.67]You're making me angry.
[396:34.65]Hey, well... I wouldn't like you if you were angry.
[396:38.99]That's all the time.
[396:40.91]You really are.
[396:41.47]Why are you such an angry person?
[396:46.49]What ever happened to positive star?
[396:49.07]What happened?
[396:50.89]When was I ever positive?
[396:52.45]I don't know.
[396:53.68]You used to do positive only streams.
[396:56.88]Remember?
[396:58.62]Oh, yeah.
[396:59.34]I remember positive.
[397:00.38]Yeah.
[397:00.88]It's coming back to me now.
[397:02.18]Positive only.
[397:03.66]So what the heck happened?
[397:05.12]Actually, we know he's coming back to you to do that.
[397:07.71]Hey, does someone want to drive this for me?
[397:11.93]Can somebody just drive this for me?
[397:14.14]What?
[397:14.28]What can I drive?
[397:15.40]Are you in a mech?
[397:17.42]I think I'm on a small pickup truck.
[397:20.12]Are you?
[397:20.34]Hold on.
[397:22.34]Legendary just dropped.
[397:29.01]I can't drive it.
[397:31.11]We can just sit on the back together.
[397:32.76]Oh my god, this thing's already going to get destroyed.
[397:35.06]What are you guys doing?
[397:35.84]Nothing.
[397:36.58]I was riding in a pickup truck, but it didn't go anywhere.
[397:38.76]I really need help with the whole alien invasion thing.
[397:44.39]I was being very liberal.
[397:45.63]I think we killed so many at this point that they don't really concern me anymore.
[397:56.00]I think we have some larger problems at hand, like the economy.
[397:59.56]Yeah, the economy and opening up new dialogues.
[398:04.11]Somebody said, I need this on PC.
[398:06.11]I know.
[398:08.21]If I could snap my fingers and just have it be on PC, I would.
[398:14.20]If I could snap my fingers again after that, I'd delete it from the PC afterwards.
[398:19.70]That wouldn't make any sense.
[398:20.64]No, this is not on PC.
[398:22.16]This is PS4 only.
[398:24.33]For an indeterminate amount of time.
[398:26.21]Nobody knows.
[398:26.69]Because only the PS4 is capable of rendering these graphics.
[398:32.47]There it is, because it's the only platform it's on!
[398:39.01]Alright, I have to collect.
[398:40.35]Good luck.
[398:41.44]There's so much shit here that I don't want to go mapping to get.
[398:44.84]Otherwise, we are not going to get anything.
[398:47.94]You know what, Jermo?
[398:49.54]We're never going to progress.
[398:50.58]That's what I'm doing.
[398:57.06]Uh-oh.
[398:59.05]Dual shock battery low.
[399:01.49]Uh-oh.
[399:06.77]Dual shock battery low?
[399:08.02]No!
[399:08.28]How much is a dual shock charge?
[399:11.46]This one is fully charged.
[399:12.68]I think it's like 10 bucks.
[399:16.63]How many hours do you have when it's unhooked?
[399:22.82]I don't know.
[399:24.40]Mine hasn't said that yet.
[399:26.20]This is fully charged.
[399:27.00]It's been, what, seven hours?
[399:28.04]$10 of charge.
[399:32.43]I guess you've been gaming harder than me.
[399:34.29]I mean, you gotta pay for gas.
[399:40.06]Okay, for electric gas.
[399:43.42]I think that's it.
[399:44.58]What do you think the electricity comes from?
[399:49.06]The gods in the sky, Zeus.
[399:54.30]That's right.
[399:58.22]Can't dispute.
[399:59.20]Stop calling me newbie.
[400:00.46]Yeah, I don't know why we're still newbies.
[400:01.94]It doesn't make any sense.
[400:03.94]Where's this guy?
[400:04.46]I hope that our building didn't become a noob.
[400:10.01]What about pizza?
[400:10.69]Dude, I want the pizza.
[400:11.71]I don't know.
[400:12.23]Someone said that you're supposed to give SamH9900 pizza.
[400:17.53]I have the Caliban support vehicle.
[400:20.77]Range weapon.
[400:21.43]Blink ball up.
[400:22.97]Still not over the whole zero.
[400:24.79]That's why I don't use it.
[400:26.64]Plasma fall up.
[400:30.02]What the hell was that?
[400:34.56]Plasma fall went up a lot, actually.
[400:39.93]Oh, it has like a health recovery room.
[400:44.11]In the vehicle.
[400:55.92]Okay.
[400:56.12]25.
[400:56.32]Artillery unit.
[400:59.86]Artillery unit.
[401:02.50]Bolt gun.
[401:07.73]Hmm...
[401:11.95]I'll try it again.
[401:12.55]What else?
[401:18.55]Where's the bow?
[401:19.19]We have to destroy artillery.
[401:21.03]We have to destroy artillery.
[401:22.99]Alright, well I have no grenade for this.
[401:24.21]I probably shouldn't play Ranger.
[401:27.17]You can't end on 25, that's bad luck.
[401:28.89]It's a quarter of a hundred.
[401:32.08]Oh, fuck.
[401:33.04]Okay.
[401:34.04]I mean... Shit, yeah.
[401:40.40]How old are you, Star?
[401:43.55]I don't know, dude.
[401:46.21]I don't know.
[401:46.87]I don't know.
[401:48.65]Like, seriously, lately I've been thinking, how old am I?
[401:52.53]I think I'm 29.
[401:53.17]You don't know how old you are?
[401:55.35]You don't know how old you are?
[401:58.23]You don't actually know how old you are.
[402:00.23]I was doing the math like a day ago.
[402:02.05]There's only one generation that forgets how old they are on purpose or on accident.
[402:07.26]No, I'm 28.
[402:09.62]Are you, though?
[402:10.16]I'm 28.
[402:11.14]Yeah, I am.
[402:14.55]Come on, I just did the math.
[402:15.79]Are you, though?
[402:19.43]I think you're older than that.
[402:20.19]I thought you were 31.
[402:20.63]No, I was born in 1990.
[402:23.77]I think you just made that up.
[402:28.30]Is that what you're the one?
[402:29.80]You're the only 30 here.
[402:30.92]That's maybe accurate.
[402:35.04]Uh, okay.
[402:36.96]Oh.
[402:38.38]Just wait.
[402:38.90]Hey, just wait, you two.
[402:40.08]You two boys.
[402:41.04]Just wait.
[402:42.38]Just wait.
[402:43.04]Yeah.
[402:44.86]Hey, hey, two boys here.
[402:47.72]Gonna be waiting for a long time, I guess.
[402:53.16]Just you guys wait.
[402:54.27]You know, a couple years before you're as old as I am now.
[402:57.43]Yeah, and then you'll see what it's like to be 30.
[402:59.45]Over 30.
[403:00.43]Well, we'll just be regular 30 and then eventually over 30.
[403:04.95]Yeah, and you tell me how you feel on that next day.
[403:16.31]Well, even then though, you're going to be just as much older than us as you are right now, so.
[403:24.99]Whatever.
[403:25.41]Oh yeah, these artillery things, didn't they used to be like robots?
[403:30.97]But now I guess they're frogs.
[403:32.93]Instead of robots, it's frogs now.
[403:36.51]How is this one any different than the other one?
[403:38.12]I mean, maybe it's more damage?
[403:39.26]What's the objective?
[403:40.48]Kill.
[403:49.23]I mean, this thing is kind of good, but it takes a ton of power.
[403:56.85]It's not that good.
[403:57.59]Other teams are late, but there's no time to wait.
[403:59.77]Approach the artillery unit and take out as many as possible.
[404:10.92]Everyone's getting old?
[404:13.02]No, I'm not.
[404:14.56]This is Alpha.
[404:15.06]Aliens ahead.
[404:17.20]We're engaging the enemy.
[404:21.55]until you're forgotten.
[404:25.51]Playing Michelangelo is so young.
[404:30.19]And I'm old.
[404:31.36]Yeah, I mean, we're not going to be 30 for at least, like, 12 years.
[404:34.46]I'm dead.
[404:36.16]Yeah.
[404:36.26]I didn't know you were that old.
[404:39.26]Somebody help.
[404:43.88]Somebody come get me.
[404:44.52]That was pretty good.
[404:45.26]Oh, he's old.
[404:52.20]Oh my bad, I mean it sucks like We got to think of what to say at your funeral you don't have that problem with us You get to just opt out Way before yeah, I decided to opt out I just waived my death rights I never read the end user license agreements
[405:19.31]No, guys, what do you mean, what's gonna happen at the funeral?
[405:22.31]I'm going to use whatever money is in my will and rent out an entire carnival.
[405:26.79]Then invite everybody that ever wants to go to the public, it's free.
[405:29.85]All the rides are free, and then at exactly, like, 4pm sharp- Wait, there are rides?
[405:35.06]Oh yeah, there's rides and shit, and at 4pm sharp exactly, they're gonna put me into a giant fucking slingshot and slingshot my casket into the fucking Atlantic Ocean.
[405:44.26]That would be cool.
[405:46.34]I think the Pacific's closer now, though.
[405:48.60]So, which coast are you planning on flying on?
[405:50.84]It's a big slingshot, just saying.
[405:59.14]That's dope.
[406:01.04]Oh, I like being this sniper.
[406:15.75]Just wait 800 years.
[406:16.75]The Atlantic will be right up against Vegas.
[406:25.39]Dude, too soon.
[406:26.94]Wow, yeah, it is.
[406:28.30]It's going to happen real soon.
[406:35.52]How come they don't have any infantry defending their artillery?
[406:40.06]What if they're the infantry and we just haven't seen the real artillery yet?
[406:43.15]800 is optimistic.
[406:45.25]Wow.
[406:46.59]Oh my god.
[406:46.93]Right in the head.
[406:47.93]Oh!
[406:48.51]Beautiful shot.
[406:51.79]Oh shit, spawn behind me.
[406:54.42]Oh man.
[406:55.76]Oh, I couldn't even move.
[406:57.60]Man!
[406:59.62]Somebody get me.
[407:00.02]You're welcome.
[407:02.14]I'd love to, but I'm gonna like die before I get there.
[407:05.58]I threw a grenade right in his head too, and it didn't matter.
[407:08.74]I couldn't move.
[407:09.49]I got double tapped when he was around.
[407:13.97]They really do love these frog enemies though, don't they?
[407:19.22]Got him with his own gun.
[407:22.44]I'll get to you sooner or later.
[407:29.23]What's your problem?
[407:35.19]Is he peeing?
[407:36.71]Did he start grunting?
[407:40.07]He's aiming right at the ground.
[407:44.65]Why am I staring at it?
[407:46.71]I can't help it.
[407:47.39]I have to stare at it.
[407:48.29]Did this guy die?
[407:50.41]I don't know what to do.
[407:57.50]I've hit this guy with so many missiles.
[407:59.72]Are you still alive?
[408:00.94]Oh, I'm good.
[408:02.50]Okay.
[408:05.27]Thanks for the help!
[408:10.69]Magic in one pixel.
[408:12.33]Just like watch that come in the whole way.
[408:28.16]Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do!
[408:29.80]Whoa!
[408:31.35]Ooh, indeed.
[408:35.44]Right in the head.
[408:36.80]Oh.
[408:37.90]Right in his head.
[408:40.59]Again.
[408:40.91]Oh, I went through his head.
[408:45.99]Went through it.
[408:47.57]Oh, no.
[408:48.67]He doesn't have any weapons, so he's useless.
[408:50.79]And somebody killed him.
[408:52.17]Seems like it might be painful.
[409:00.64]That he didn't keep walking?
[409:02.22]God damn it.
[409:03.54]Oh, no.
[409:04.14]Am I dead?
[409:05.46]I don't like the green.
[409:06.59]I'm coming for you.
[409:07.81]I'm coming.
[409:09.33]Am I dead?
[409:09.91]I think there's only one dude.
[409:12.65]Yeah, I'm trying to deflect the artillery shots, but it's difficult to aim.
[409:16.40]Why did he just watch that?
[409:17.68]I'm dead.
[409:20.26]We're almost dead.
[409:25.54]Dermot, acknowledge me.
[409:26.65]What's up?
[409:28.74]Wow, senpai.
[409:29.62]Dude, welcome to the germs.
[409:31.34]Moon unit!
[409:32.68]What's happening?
[409:44.84]I helped a little.
[409:46.86]Jerm or the weapon box?
[409:49.40]I got the weapon box.
[409:50.85]I got a lot of them, actually.
[409:52.01]I got at least one.
[409:55.81]Plasma fall again.
[409:58.43]Rush core again, bolt shooter again Aggressive alien species Species B
[410:23.81]Up to level 8 now.
[410:24.81]Perfect.
[410:25.11]I can finally equip this dumb thing that I haven't seen all game.
[410:28.25]The Splasher.
[410:33.36]The Splasher?
[410:34.72]That's what it's called.
[410:35.44]Some of this stuff has really dumb names.
[410:40.46]Like Jerma.
[410:45.14]Did I miss something?
[410:50.75]Nope.
[410:51.17]Not really.
[410:51.87]Nope.
[410:52.35]Okay.
[410:53.05]Just checking.
[410:56.03]Um... I like this thing.
[410:59.41]Keep it on.
[411:03.98]I don't know what to use.
[411:14.96]Funny.
[411:16.72]Funny how you don't know.
[411:26.21]Let's go.
[411:27.05]Hey, remember when we were gonna do the last one three missions ago?
[411:29.45]Alex, you know what?
[411:30.59]I can't wait for us to split a large, delicious pepperoni thin crust pizza with that kind of, with the greasy peanut, not peanut butter, the greasy.
[411:42.82]Greasy peanut butter all along here.
[411:44.52]With the greasy pepper, whatever, I fucked up.
[411:46.56]Hey, Chad, does anybody else Reese's on their pizza?
[411:51.87]Pepperoni with the greasy, crispy pepperoni slices.
[411:55.13]Dude, I swear to God, every time I switch off of artillery guy, we get a mission like this.
[412:00.87]What is this?
[412:01.96]Okay, I gotta be in the air for this.
[412:05.32]I can only shoot this nine times the whole mission.
[412:07.88]This thing sucks.
[412:09.46]I picked the wrong loadout, guys.
[412:11.56]I have 18 shots.
[412:13.20]Same.
[412:15.22]Let's see if it's even good.
[412:16.52]Not even good.
[412:20.32]There's somebody leading the monsters.
[412:22.16]Who is leading them?
[412:22.76]Okay, if you only get 18 shots of something, don't you think it should one shot a frog?
[412:27.56]Yeah.
[412:27.74]One shot a frog.
[412:28.54]There's three shots of frogs.
[412:31.94]I can kill... How many frogs?
[412:35.38]One.
[412:36.02]That's six frogs, I think.
[412:40.04]There's so many particles in the screen.
[412:41.65]I can't even tell which particle is mine.
[412:43.43]Oh.
[412:49.50]This thing is just spam and it takes so much energy.
[412:53.10]I just want to apologize for my reckless behavior.
[412:56.32]Do you want to retreat?
[412:59.07]Yeah.
[413:01.93]There's a lot of spiders there.
[413:07.79]You've chosen to retreat.
[413:09.47]Why would you retreat?
[413:10.75]Are you not paying attention?
[413:13.33]But we can do it.
[413:14.49]We have to retreat.
[413:15.41]We can do it.
[413:18.08]One of our players had a weapon that didn't do anything.
[413:21.28]Literally, I had nine shots per weapon, and it took three blasts, no reload, to kill one frog.
[413:28.65]Oh.
[413:33.71]Oh, I can... Hey.
[413:35.93]Do you want to guide kit me?
[413:38.57]No.
[413:38.77]Because I have one that's not... I can get to 15 targets.
[413:44.80]No.
[413:45.04]No.
[413:47.06]15 at the same time.
[413:48.28]Oh, I'm just equipping a bunch of airstrikes.
[413:50.32]Do you listen to your teammates?
[413:51.82]I mean, not really.
[413:53.72]No.
[413:53.98]Pretty much what I hear is this, like... It's like, I don't know.
[413:59.34]I had this cool co-op thing, and then... I just hear... No co-op moments here.
[414:07.28]That's all I hear.
[414:07.78]It's like a... Yeah, how about we all go into our own separate solo games and do the same mission and, like, stop talking to each other?
[414:16.65]Animal Crossing.
[414:19.27]Alright, which one of these guns is good for killing lots of people?
[414:24.12]Okay.
[414:30.94]I'm ready.
[414:32.28]I'm not, but I am.
[414:33.50]I can't find the gun.
[414:41.55]Two flamethrowers.
[414:42.53]Isabel, is that you?
[414:47.38]Alright, let's talk about a real pizza, not a thin crust pepperoni, please.
[414:50.62]Shut.
[414:52.07]That's the best kind of pizza.
[414:53.29]Thin crust, crispy, crunchy, greasy.
[414:56.17]It's got to be greasy.
[414:57.85]Cheese.
[414:58.09]I'll eat that as like a secondary pizza, but it certainly wouldn't be the main course.
[415:01.53]You know what I mean?
[415:02.47]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[415:03.31]And like peanut butter.
[415:06.58]I like peanut butter crust.
[415:08.40]Yeah, peanut butter filled crust.
[415:09.82]I think Pizza Hut did that first.
[415:13.74]And when you bite it, it goes... And the grease and, like, oil goes down your chin and all over your clothes.
[415:19.64]Alright, I gotta get close for this, unfortunately.
[415:28.38]Alright.
[415:44.14]Look at that mouth.
[415:45.58]He's been eating a lot of fucking good pizza.
[415:46.94]That's what I tell you.
[415:50.00]If I use both flamethrowers at the same time, it's actually impossible.
[415:55.72]To keep the screen down.
[416:04.63]I can't tell if that's doing anything.
[416:07.51]I honestly can't.
[416:12.98]Oh no, I'm in trouble.
[416:14.86]I'm down, I'm gonna die.
[416:20.67]Hell, hell, hell, hell!
[416:27.41]Get out of the way, hell!
[416:30.06]Where do I go now?
[416:36.52]Why does Flamethrower have recoil?
[416:38.10]Because it's insanely powerful.
[416:45.50]and it has a lot yeah I don't like this thing oh let's reset oh retreat no no what are you talking about I didn't say that can we retreat retreat he hates it nice we're not on pc great little like escape sound
[417:13.76]What?
[417:14.98]You made like a... I'm trying to make a loud escape sound.
[417:19.88]How do you sing the next verse?
[417:21.10]I want to hear the rest of the song.
[417:24.04]I don't know.
[417:31.61]I think you just have to say it to your soldiers in this game.
[417:34.75]Then they just start singing.
[417:39.14]That's a major slowdown.
[417:41.50]It's unfortunate that I decided to go only close range weapons and forgot my mobility ability.
[418:04.37]You better be picking up boxes.
[418:05.99]What do you think I've been doing?
[418:09.09]I've been making it part of my routine here.
[418:18.76]I figured it out.
[418:19.72]What happened?
[418:24.22]Pick up all the money.
[418:25.12]Are you dropping bombs here?
[418:29.32]I think you're dropping bombs right here, but it's okay.
[418:32.85]I'm not a single soul.
[418:36.27]See, look how strong this flamethrower is.
[418:37.95]Now I'm really hungry.
[418:39.49]This is why it has recoil.
[418:41.25]I'm starving now.
[418:42.13]Stop talking about food!
[418:43.11]Well, you mentioned the pizza thing, and then I just kept seeing an image.
[418:49.14]Die, Etalyx.
[418:50.88]Die?
[418:51.22]Are you killing me?
[418:53.84]Yes, that is the answer to that question.
[418:59.38]I mean, you deserved it.
[419:03.24]Talking about food.
[419:10.38]Wait, now you're gonna have to revive me.
[419:14.34]Unless you want to restart the mission again.
[419:16.70]Oh, let's do it.
[419:17.36]I love restarting.
[419:18.00]Uh-oh.
[419:19.50]Go ahead.
[419:20.51]I dare you.
[419:21.25]This guy's unloading for free on me.
[419:23.53]I'm so embarrassed.
[419:24.73]I knew you couldn't do it.
[419:25.69]I think I'm just gonna die again, actually.
[419:29.93]I was like, I have a face still.
[419:31.98]I'm gonna revive you again.
[419:37.99]Good.
[419:38.85]He's dead.
[419:48.69]And we are getting late here, aren't we?
[419:52.07]It's like 2, what, 2 a.m.
[419:53.41]Eastern?
[419:55.73]Time flies when you're killing bugs.
[420:08.95]I'm gonna go get some more buckets.
[420:09.95]What would be a proper weapon for this class, for this mission?
[420:17.26]The kissing one.
[420:21.72]That's the bug's voice.
[420:22.76]I mean, I do like kissing spiders.
[420:27.08]I do too, oh my god.
[420:31.09]Who doesn't love like a hot dryer?
[420:32.83]Did you hear that there was a scorpion in the house?
[420:40.13]I heard.
[420:41.81]Put it there.
[420:42.21]I'm scary.
[420:44.41]I bought it from the pet store and left it there.
[420:46.45]That's not cool.
[420:48.33]Oh, you got a lot of shit to pick up.
[420:55.98]I am just running around.
[421:00.86]That's all I've been doing.
[421:01.78]Got some extra armor.
[421:12.93]We've been live for just over seven hours.
[421:16.55]By this point, you should have consumed at least one mortal soul.
[421:23.39]Interesting.
[421:25.69]Is that the secret to your eternal youth?
[421:30.91]Alright, hungry friends.
[421:35.88]Do me this favor.
[421:36.78]You know what?
[421:37.52]Let's call it there because this next one is a drone mission.
[421:40.64]Here, can you do me one favor?
[421:43.68]Yeah?
[421:44.54]Can you just start the mission with the beam?
[421:46.26]I just want to see what my highest tier missile launcher I've had the whole game does.
[421:50.53]I'm not even fucking hungry, buddy.
[421:53.35]I just want to see what it does.
[421:54.99]I'm not going to have to do the mission.
[421:56.65]I got to get the targeting laser is what you want me to get.
[421:58.55]You want me to be your bitch.
[422:01.03]I mean, you are the support character.
[422:03.68]He's leaving, he's leaving, he's leaving.
[422:04.62]I'm the character killing all of everything.
[422:06.28]Not yet.
[422:07.70]I'll be around for, like, another, well, little bit.
[422:10.44]You do, I mean, call down all of the support vehicles and then instantly get in them.
[422:17.11]So... What was that sound?
[422:22.11]It was like... So I had to switch classes to someone who could fight for himself.
[422:28.31]Okay, shoot it.
[422:33.00]Let's see what it looks like.
[422:33.82]Whoa.
[422:39.77]Nice.
[422:41.69]Let's see.
[422:42.07]Is it going to hit it?
[422:44.69]Oh, I don't think so.
[422:46.67]They're just flying.
[422:47.55]Are they coming back?
[422:50.33]Where are they going?
[422:51.07]They're coming back at us.
[422:55.83]They're just going straight at us.
[423:02.23]I can do like 30 missiles this way, man.
[423:04.35]Those are going to hit us too.
[423:06.57]We're going to wreck them.
[423:11.06]What are we even doing here?
[423:13.04]They're not attacking.
[423:16.98]We ought to kill these drones.
[423:18.66]This is a drone mission.
[423:19.54]It's up to you to mark them and you guide the missiles.
[423:22.12]This is a drone mission.
[423:23.76]I think it's time.
[423:24.56]These things are reminding me of pizzas.
[423:28.21]These just look like pizzas.
[423:30.11]Guide them.
[423:36.17]Why can't I shoot with my other missile launcher right now?
[423:38.13]I'm not sure I can handle this.
[423:51.72]I mean, it's not bad.
[423:52.50]It's like 18 missiles per launcher.
[423:55.92]It'd be good.
[423:56.36]It just requires two people to aim them.
[423:58.83]Yeah.
[424:00.19]I cannot catch up with any of these guys.
[424:05.58]Yeah, this mission is going to suck.
[424:07.44]This is going to require a lot more.
[424:08.78]What's the objective?
[424:10.00]Kill all the things?
[424:11.34]It's always kill all the things.
[424:13.18]Yeah, but they're... You always ask, and it's always kill all the things.
[424:17.10]So we had to walk forward.
[424:19.52]So the objective is walk forward, then kill all the things.
[424:22.00]Is that what you're saying?
[424:26.60]Yeah.
[424:28.50]Look, sometimes it's ants.
[424:30.16]Sometimes it's saucers.
[424:31.44]Sometimes it's pylons.
[424:33.31]Sometimes...
[424:35.12]It's red ants.
[424:36.66]Sometimes it's green frogs.
[424:38.73]Sometimes it's time to go and make your own pizza.
[424:45.79]Pizza!
[424:47.43]How long did you wait to do that?
[424:48.75]Five seconds.
[424:55.92]Okay.
[424:57.06]Alright.
[424:58.70]Well, EDF5, that's fun.
[425:01.90]I'm glad I got that last line out there just before the end.
[425:06.42]No items required.
[425:11.36]Well, that was fun.
[425:14.50]That's a fun game.
[425:17.44]Most armor, highest completion rate.
[425:23.62]Highest weapons.
[425:25.44]I'm just putting the microwave in the pizza.
[425:29.94]Just putting the microwave in the pizza, guys.
[425:33.69]You don't have a pizza.
[425:35.85]Alright, well, Etalyx and Ster.
[425:40.19]Thank you for showing me this game.
[425:41.63]It's very fun.
[425:42.31]It's a very fun game.
[425:43.27]It's very grindy and it's kind of just like a little hangout fun game with some friends.
[425:49.12]But you're not going to play tomorrow.
[425:51.46]Do you want to play tomorrow?
[425:53.46]Off camera, though.
[426:00.17]I don't know, dude.
[426:01.98]Does anything you do actually matter if it's off camera?
[426:05.16]I'm just kidding.
[426:07.46]Hey, webcam's on, by the way.
[426:09.68]Webcam is on.
[426:12.58]I copied it from Jerma's chat.
[426:16.06]Somebody in there posted a porn link.
[426:18.54]Did you get... No, don't do that.
[426:20.06]I honestly thought that
[426:23.30]I need it for my start a call after, you know, that I'm doing.
[426:27.42]Alright.
[426:28.26]Well, I'll see you guys.
[426:29.16]Well, you could screen share.
[426:30.62]Yeah, I was going to say that, too.
[426:31.88]Well, you guys have fun.
[426:32.80]Have fun doing that.
[426:34.30]I'm going to spell it out.
[426:35.78]F-U-C-K-I-N-G space W-E-I-R-D-O-O-S.
[426:41.48]So bye.
[426:42.44]He's gone.
[426:42.93]Star's gone.
[426:44.11]He's already gone.
[426:46.25]So thanks, Star, for coming.
[426:50.72]And, uh... We're gonna have to have a discussion about this pizza.
[426:54.32]Yes, we're about to both turn our streams off here and have a pizza discussion.
[427:00.38]But, uh, see you later.
[427:03.08]Thanks for playing.
[427:03.70]I hope you had fun, Etalyx.
[427:05.66]I'm in the next room.
[427:08.52]I'm two rooms over.
[427:10.80]What are you... I almost just dropped another coffee on my desk.
[427:13.70]I'm out.
[427:14.50]Alright, I left.
[427:16.74]Hey, I'm sorry.
[427:17.53]I left abruptly.
[427:18.33]I almost dropped a coffee on my desk.
[427:20.77]Hey, don't drop a coffee on my PS4.
[427:23.57]I've already dropped all kinds of shit on there.
[427:25.25]Goodbye, other porn posting chatter.
[427:28.23]I'm not going to let you finish that one.
[427:31.51]Anyways, thanks for coming out, guys.
[427:35.72]Just a... EDF is a lot of fun.
[427:40.70]Hopefully it was interesting at least to watch for a little while.
[427:42.64]I know we got pretty late here.
[427:44.72]It's like 11 o'clock Pacific, which is very late for everybody else.
[427:51.19]Let's go back and do the bits.
[427:52.73]It should not take us very long.
[427:59.82]Thank you, Todd.
[428:01.24]Todd flowered for the $1 squash them bugs.
[428:05.26]Hashtag charity.
[428:07.06]Oh yeah, I believe if you give bits and you do hashtag charity
[428:14.28]They are running a... Twitch is running a campaign, I think, right now, right?
[428:19.37]So that's good.
[428:21.81]But thank you, Todd.
[428:23.13]Thank you, Marvish Magali, for the dollar and ten cents.
[428:25.05]I find this stream inherently satisfying.
[428:27.75]EDF is inherently satisfying to play.
[428:35.05]It is a very satisfying game.
[428:37.45]Uh, Werwid, thanks for the one dollar.
[428:38.99]Jackbox marathon with your friends.
[428:40.73]When?
[428:44.06]Um... I don't know.
[428:46.20]I mean, EDF was... We've all been kind of looking forward to the game, so... That's why we did that tonight.
[428:54.10]He needs friends for... I got plenty of friends.
[428:55.76]Okay.
[428:56.82]Come on.
[428:59.70]Thank you, Divus, for the three bucks.
[429:01.65]Hashtag charity.
[429:03.15]Thank you.
[429:06.95]Thank you, Divus.
[429:10.20]Lukewarm soda can, thanks for the one dollar.
[429:12.82]Bugs are scary.
[429:14.40]I don't like them either.
[429:17.32]Bugs are just, they gross me out, they freak me out.
[429:23.03]Some bugs I think are okay.
[429:25.25]But, I don't know, spiders are weird.
[429:27.73]Anything that can poison you or sting you.
[429:32.04]Some bugs can put you in the hospital, you know, that's scary.
[429:36.22]I agree.
[429:38.53]Thank you, MostlyLost, for the $1.
[429:39.63]Hey, everyone, PSA, don't forget to add hashtag charity to your bit donations.
[429:45.52]Yes, absolutely.
[429:49.74]Thank you, MostlyLost, for the reminder.
[429:52.92]Sly161, thanks for the $1.
[429:54.52]Hey, Jerm, thanks for the streaming EDF.
[429:56.01]Looks good so far.
[429:57.71]And I really want it, but I'm waiting for a PC port of it to come out.
[430:01.55]Hope you enjoyed it.
[430:04.24]I wish it would come out on PC.
[430:05.30]I was actually going to wait for the PC version as well, but there's been no announcement at all that it's coming.
[430:11.63]And I think the last one, when EDF4 came out, wasn't it almost a year before they even talked about it coming out on PC?
[430:23.64]It was something like that.
[430:27.62]It's gonna be a while, so if you really want to enjoy EDF5, then you, unfortunately, and you can't wait, you're gonna have to buy it on PS4.
[430:36.07]But it's a very fun game.
[430:37.93]Lukewarm Soda Can, again, thanks for the $1.
[430:39.67]I don't like bugs.
[430:40.59]Hold me, I'm scared.
[430:42.25]Lukewarm Soda Can, again, $10.
[430:43.40]$10 from Lukewarm Soda Can.
[430:49.11]Thank you.
[430:50.39]So much for your $10.
[430:51.39]Wish I could stick around, but I have finals to study for college and responsibilities.
[430:54.81]Also, bugs are scary.
[430:56.66]Nope.
[430:57.60]And then hashtag charity.
[430:59.44]Thank you.
[431:01.34]And yeah, good luck.
[431:03.22]Uh, you guys aren't gonna see me for a couple of days here.
[431:06.78]The next stream is probably gonna be on Saturday, and I'm gonna be building a birdhouse.
[431:12.51]And something else that I've- I've- It's gonna be the worst thing ever, but I feel like I want to just do it because it might be funny, it might be fun.
[431:20.64]After the birdhouse, something else is gonna happen.
[431:24.04]And I don't know how you guys are gonna feel about it, but it's gonna happen.
[431:29.96]Because the birdhouse is gonna take me probably 30 minutes.
[431:37.02]No, it is not a video game.
[431:39.06]It's... It is... It's not something anyone's gonna want to watch.
[431:47.78]It's gonna take... It's gonna take me 25 minutes to make the birdhouse that I got.
[431:51.67]And, like, paint it.
[431:55.63]And I'm not gonna do a 25 minute stream.
[432:04.11]But... See you Saturday.
[432:10.74]And good luck on your finals, everybody.
[432:14.14]It is currently Wednesday.
[432:16.59]Or Thursday for a lot of you.
[432:19.41]And hopefully you do well.
[432:23.22]Thank you, Mr. Sneakman, for the $1.80.
[432:24.86]Just went through the most stressful day at school in a long time.
[432:28.09]And I think I just hit the stream jackpot.
[432:30.53]Excited to watch you dorks play this and keep my mind off of impending doom that the midterm tests coming up next month.
[432:37.77]Thanks as always and keep up the quality streams.
[432:39.57]Jeremiah Hart, hashtag charity.
[432:40.77]Thank you, Mr. Sneakman.
[432:47.32]Good luck to you on your midterms.
[432:53.81]Glad you could come here and unwind.
[432:57.80]Today was like, it was just chill, you know?
[433:01.40]I screamed a few times, but... EDF is just a very relaxing game.
[433:07.32]You just kind of burn through bugs.
[433:12.47]Uh, WildFox, thanks for the one dollar.
[433:15.69]Do you eat ass?
[433:16.65]No, seriously though, please listen and watch this.
[433:18.79]Is this gonna be something about me eating ass?
[433:27.38]Hold on.
[433:29.98]Make sure this is not about me eating ass.
[433:37.46]Oh, let's see.
[433:39.92]It's time to kick gum and chew ass.
[433:43.90]It's time to kick gum and chew ass.
[433:51.19]Fuck.
[433:51.75]I don't...
[434:08.38]The title is just meme.
[434:10.00]Is this some kind of meme?
[434:16.46]What the fuck?
[434:24.04]Is this- is this you?
[434:32.74]Is this- is this- WildFox, is this you doing this?
[434:35.11]That's me.
[434:37.57]Is this some kind of meme?
[434:38.35]It's a classic meme?
[434:40.98]Well, it's classic.
[434:48.36]Thank you for that, WildFox.
[434:49.90]Hey, Garfield the Monday Killer!
[434:52.04]What's happening?
[434:53.26]Jerma aliens are attacking the Garfield residence.
[434:55.36]Oh my... Blizz, Jerma, what's Garf gonna do?
[434:59.47]Can we talk about this right now?
[435:00.81]Jerma reads all these Garfographs and very rarely complains about how weird they are.
[435:05.31]You roll with the punches, Jerm.
[435:06.37]I respect that.
[435:07.03]That being said, already board up the windows and doors.
[435:10.23]They're coming for me and Jerma.
[435:12.23]They think Mondays are sacred or something and they want my head.
[435:14.75]I need a Christmas miracle.
[435:15.79]I need Grinch's green pancakes.
[435:18.03]Only at IHOP.
[435:19.00]Why would you eat green pancakes?
[435:22.26]Just order regular pancakes.
[435:25.50]All the Grinch's green pancakes are is just pancakes with a shitload of food coloring in them.
[435:29.36]That can't be good for your body.
[435:32.78]Salmon.
[435:34.91]425 degrees in the oven.
[435:36.03]8 minutes?
[435:38.91]15 minutes?
[435:39.49]Just find a recipe.
[435:44.28]Thank you, Garfield.
[435:45.06]Thank you, Valk, for the $1.
[435:47.10]Devil May Cry 5 releases on March 8th.
[435:51.06]Maybe we'll play it.

[438:08.52]And don't go crazy.
[438:09.12]Don't eat like 10 pieces of salmon over the course of three days.

[438:45.17]Top hat.
[438:58.12]Why is everybody ha-ha-ing me?
[439:00.24]Are you ha-ha-ing the top hat, or are you ha-ha-ing me?

[439:51.65]Thank you.
[439:55.27]Thank you, Elizabeth, for the one dollar.
[439:56.57]I've accidentally messaged a friend porn on Steam because I thought I had something else copied.
[440:01.07]However, a month or two later, he did the same to me, so he laughed it off.
[440:06.30]You guys saving pornography to your clipboard?
[440:09.66]Mm-mm.
[440:11.94]What?
[440:13.74]What?
[440:17.46]Thank you, Leather Jacket, for the one dollar.
[440:19.90]I feel as if leaving the accidental porn link is a better punishment.
[440:23.42]It's like when you get caught passing notes in class and are forced to read it in front of everyone.
[440:39.98]That's fucking funny.
[440:42.66]That's true, though.
[440:50.94]Thanks, Leatherjacket.
[440:53.02]Hey, Josephilia, thanks for the $1.
[440:54.50]Can I have a hug?
[440:56.24]Yeah.
[440:58.02]Okay.
[440:59.80]Thanks for the $1.
[441:02.98]Thank you, Josephilia.
[441:06.53]Caelid, thank you, Caleb5606 for the two bucks.
[441:09.45]Why do you hate Australians?
[441:13.39]When did I ever say that?
[441:14.15]Are we talking about time zones?
[441:21.79]Is Pacific time as far away from Australia as possible?
[441:32.39]Because if it was three, it might be.
[441:36.52]No.
[441:38.10]What's the furthest time zone from PS2?
[441:44.34]What country is the furthest from my time zone?
[441:49.69]I'm not sure.
[441:52.14]It's 6 p.m.
[441:53.30]in Australia right now.
[441:55.30]That sounds pretty huge.
[442:00.90]That sounds like it's 12 hours.
[442:05.47]December 13th, 6 p.m.
[442:07.01]in Australia.
[442:07.57]Holy shit.
[442:10.21]That's wild.
[442:13.51]What time is it on the sun?
[442:17.22]There is no time on the sun.
[442:18.34]It's timeless.
[442:22.20]But thank you, Caelid.
[442:23.02]I don't hate Australians.
[442:23.86]What are you talking about?
[442:26.80]Come on.
[442:28.74]Come on.
[442:29.26]I've done that a lot today.
[442:30.02]Hey, what did you make?
[442:30.58]Come on.
[442:32.14]Hey, Garden of Eden, thanks for the $10, Garden of Eden.
[442:36.60]Thanks for 10 bucks.
[442:38.16]Jeremiah, I want to send you mail.
[442:40.17]Do you have a PO box?
[442:42.31]Uh, hashtag charity.
[442:44.51]No.
[442:45.01]I mean, I've thought about doing that before, but that gets really messy.
[442:49.38]Because you never know what fucking somebody might send you.
[443:00.49]So I've stayed away from it.
[443:05.99]I have stayed away from it.
[443:07.74]So probably not.
[443:09.44]But I do appreciate anybody that wants to give me something.
[443:12.70]But don't worry about that.
[443:16.21]Thank you for even considering, though, and thanks for the $10 right now.
[443:19.45]Gardevin.
[443:23.79]Uh, almost done.
[443:24.43]DinkyDuper, thanks for the $1.
[443:25.67]I couldn't think of a joke for this donation.
[443:27.08]Every time I tried to think of one, it would always end in calling you a boomer.
[443:30.48]Well, I guess I just did that anyways.
[443:32.30]The game looks like a lot of fun, while it has some questionable voice acting, which actually reminds me a lot of Michigan Report from Hell.
[443:38.00]I can't wait for the Compact Gaming Birdhouse stream, even though there's no birds in Vegas.
[443:42.54]But until then, I'll see you next time.
[443:44.95]Jermamites.
[443:46.88]Thank you, DinkyDuper.
[443:50.12]The Compact Gaming Birdhouse.
[443:53.58]Does that have to be the title of that stream?
[443:56.96]It might have to be.
[443:59.02]Honeychain, thanks for the $1.
[444:00.99]They only want you when you're... What is happening?
[444:08.03]They want you when you're 17, when you're 21, you're no fun, you're 33, loud pee, hashtag charity.
[444:17.13]I don't know what this means.
[444:20.73]But thanks for the $1.
[444:21.59]Thanks for the charity.
[444:22.27]Thanks for the hashtag charity.
[444:35.34]Let's see.
[444:36.18]Art... Art Van...
[444:40.68]Delay Exporter.
[444:42.54]Thanks for the $1.10.
[444:42.96]It was a lot of fun tonight.
[444:45.26]Thanks for streaming.
[444:45.88]Hashtag charity.
[444:46.55]No, it was... It's always fun to get... It's always fun to get the gang together every now and again, right?
[444:52.47]It was fun.
[444:54.81]Timmy Tim Tim, thanks for the $1.
[444:56.01]Hey, would you ever stream Symphony of the Night?
[444:57.55]I'm playing it at the moment and thinking I'd love to see you play it.
[445:01.08]Talk about Castlevania.
[445:02.04]Castlevania... There's a lot of Castlevania games.
[445:11.91]I don't know.
[445:12.33]I can't say that I would be completely into that.
[445:19.33]When are you going to eat your death adder?
[445:25.62]Well, I'm not going to.
[445:31.78]But, I mean, the Castlevania games are amazing, but I don't know if I would stream them.
[445:39.16]But thank you for the suggestion.
[445:40.20]I'm not against... I'm not against ever doing anything.
[445:44.48]But... I work in the present.
[445:47.74]My brain works in right now, and that's something I'm probably not going to do right now.
[445:53.11]But thank you.
[445:54.31]Thank you, FishyFroy, for the $5.
[445:55.39]I'm usually at school or work during your streams.
[445:58.25]But a new release on Second Jerma is always an event to celebrate.
[446:01.55]Me and my friends all gather around to watch, and it's always a good time.
[446:03.87]Thanks for the laughs.
[446:04.59]Thanks for the $5, FishyFroy.
[446:08.23]And thank you to Holy Mac for the fantastic job that he does editing those videos.
[446:16.79]So, thank you so much.
[446:19.54]Really appreciate it.
[446:20.78]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $1.
[446:21.84]What's your favorite pizza topping?
[446:23.20]Hashtag charity.
[446:23.98]I'm just a pepperoni kind of guy.
[446:27.14]Just thin crust, pepperoni.
[446:30.81]There's no bullshit.
[446:32.31]I'll eat the whole pizza.
[446:33.66]Or buffalo chicken pizza.
[446:35.58]When they do the big blue cheese swirl around the middle.
[446:38.36]Okay, I gotta go.
[446:41.98]Thank you, Jaspi, for the one dollar.
[446:44.48]It's almost our three year anniversary and I'm still waiting for a proposal.
[446:47.36]You could make it up to me by telling me your favorite sports teams.
[446:50.94]Boston Red Sox.
[446:53.60]And that's pretty much it.
[446:55.94]I really only am like a Red Sox fan.
[446:59.22]I would say the Patriots, but I don't really watch the Patriots.
[447:02.56]I don't really watch football.
[447:09.16]So, the Red Sox.
[447:12.01]And that's it.
[447:12.79]And with that, we're going to run the credits.
[447:14.55]All the new subs that came in.
[447:15.57]Alex and I are going to go get a pizza.
[447:23.27]And is there some reason why I cannot move over here now?
[447:27.78]Well, let's see if I can do it from here.
[447:39.91]Streamlabs, what are you doing?
[447:40.93]There we go.
[447:43.33]Alright.
[447:45.07]Thanks to everybody that subbed and resubbed.
[447:52.33]We are... We're at a huge amount of subs.
[447:59.83]Etalyx is starving, waiting for me to finish the post stream.
[448:04.11]No, this was quick tonight.
[448:05.77]This was not even like 25 minutes, 20 minutes.
[448:10.37]It's very late.
[448:12.28]Thanks to those of you that stayed up.
[448:17.90]We'll see you again soon.
[448:20.42]Saturday is the day.
[448:23.16]Mark it on your calendar.
[448:24.02]We're gonna just... We're just gonna have a chill bird feeding stream.
[448:30.35]Almost at 200,000 followers, too.
[448:33.83]Less than 30 followers away from 200,000.
[448:36.31]That's a lot of people.
[448:49.04]A chill bird-eating stream.
[448:56.78]Enjoy pizza time.
[448:58.02]Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[449:00.46]And then I gotta get a lot of stuff done around the house.
[449:06.98]And I gotta get some doctor's appointment stuff settled.
[449:10.90]Because I have to go get... I need to go get like a celiac test.
[449:15.89]Or like a gluten intolerance test.
[449:18.25]Because that's been really weird.
[449:19.63]I gotta go figure out what the fuck's going on with that shit.
[449:22.85]So I'm gonna take the next couple days off.
[449:27.35]And I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[449:37.28]Because I just need to know, you know, I want to know because I've been avoiding all bread and gluten kind of products for a couple months now.
[449:49.07]Fancy bartender stream?
[449:55.36]Yeah, mark that on the calendar too, that would be really fun.
[449:59.16]I feel like I would need a bunch of people here, though.
[450:01.91]You know what I mean?
[450:02.41]I feel like I would need to do that somewhere.
[450:04.75]And have a bunch of friends come out for that.
[450:08.23]And they have to try my cocktails.
[450:12.74]Then goes and eats pizza.
[450:13.90]Well, if you heard me earlier, I was talking about how I... I kept hearing the word pizza, and I'm like, I have to eat it.
[450:23.53]But actually, it's gonna be a pretty good indicator because... It's something that I eliminated.
[450:28.82]I started taking like a probiotic and I eliminated all gluten from my diet.
[450:32.42]And I started feeling kind of fine.
[450:34.08]I started feeling a little bit better.
[450:36.50]And... I mean, I don't know.
[450:38.40]It's been so long that now if I eat a shitload of pizza, and if I like, I'm keeling over... Like, oh!
[450:44.96]In pain and... Then it's, that's, the fucking deal is sealed.
[450:48.46]You know what I mean?
[450:52.44]At that point, I know, and then I'm just gonna have to figure out what the hell I'm gonna do about it.
[450:59.39]I'll be fine.
[451:00.57]I've eaten plenty of bread, so don't worry.
[451:03.89]Just not in the last, like, month or two.
[451:08.01]Or a gluten-free pizza, that's true.
[451:10.47]But that's my time.
[451:12.59]I'll see you guys Saturday.
[451:13.32]Have a great rest of your night.
[451:14.30]Have a wonderful rest of your morning, or whatever time it is where you are.
[451:18.40]Thanks for sticking around.
[451:18.98]Hope you had fun.
[451:19.82]I did.
[451:20.80]It's always a blast.
[451:22.85]See you this weekend.
