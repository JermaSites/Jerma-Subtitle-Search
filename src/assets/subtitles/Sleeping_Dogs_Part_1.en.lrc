[01:07.52]Hey.
[01:09.20]No, I went out in the woods today.
[01:13.27]It is raining outside.
[01:14.43]I can't do that.
[01:15.91]I'm not going to destroy $25,000 worth of equipment, guys.
[01:24.15]Wait, what do you mean $10 joke?
[01:26.69]What's the $10?
[01:27.77]I did a joke already?
[01:28.69]I wasn't aware.
[01:33.47]Hold on a second.
[01:34.79]I'll be with you in one moment.
[02:20.08]Alrighty.
[02:21.62]Let's get started, shall we?
[02:25.51]Where's the new emote?
[02:27.33]Ah, shit.
[02:27.93]You're right.
[02:29.93]Oh, no.
[02:31.73]I didn't do... I didn't make jermaSnort.
[02:36.64]Time to burn this witch at the stake.
[02:40.04]Ah, shit.
[02:40.64]Hold on.
[02:41.18]You guys can't even hear anything?
[02:42.44]There we go.
[02:44.72]That's probably better.
[02:48.64]There we go.
[02:50.67]Yeah, I've been dealing with this.
[02:52.99]Let me tell you something.
[02:56.04]Don't ever live in a house.
[02:57.22]Don't ever live anywhere.
[02:58.04]Yeah, my dishwasher has been broken for like six months.
[03:04.37]Don't ever live in a place.
[03:05.41]You know what I'm saying?
[03:06.55]I've tried to get somebody to come out and fix problems for me in this place.
[03:10.78]They don't fucking do it.
[03:12.54]This is how a conversation goes with me and people that you call to do a service for you.
[03:19.22]It goes like this.
[03:20.56]I ring ring, they go, yeah, hey, yeah, I'm just curious.
[03:25.95]My name's Jeremy Elbertson.
[03:27.45]I'm calling from Massachusetts area.
[03:29.39]Do you guys have any availability to come down and take a look at my dryer?
[03:35.17]Yeah.
[03:36.76]What do you got going on on Monday?
[03:40.48]Well, actually, Monday's great.
[03:41.54]Monday would be perfect.
[03:42.42]Actually, I'm not really doing much on Monday.
[03:45.46]What time on Monday?
[03:47.79]Between the hours of 2 and 6.
[03:53.17]Okay.
[03:53.51]Yeah, great.
[03:54.15]I'll be ready for you.
[03:54.81]That sounds good.
[03:56.59]And then the person never calls you back ever again, and you never hear or see from them.
[04:01.14]And then you call, and they don't fucking answer.
[04:04.64]Or they just don't answer the phone in the first place.
[04:10.68]This is Lou's Mice Control.
[04:13.95]How can I help you?
[04:14.65]Hey Lou, could you come down to... My name's Jeremy Elbertson.
[04:18.17]I'm calling because I'm having a little bit of a problem with some potential mice I'm having.
[04:23.28]Yeah.
[04:24.41]Oh, okay.
[04:25.07]Cool.
[04:26.13]That's the service you provide.
[04:27.35]Okay, great.
[04:28.63]Could you tell me... Wait, hold on a minute.
[04:30.71]What's the smell smell like?
[04:33.68]I'm not sure.
[04:34.14]I can't really understand.
[04:35.90]I think it smells like a dead animal.
[04:39.86]Does it smell like Swiss cheese or Parmesan cheese?
[04:43.48]I don't know.
[04:44.64]I can't answer that question.
[04:45.47]It just smells terrible.
[04:46.63]Well, I can't help you then.
[04:47.55]It's probably carpenter ants.
[04:48.77]Bye.
[04:49.11]Bye.
[04:55.11]I'm fucking, I'm gonna live under a goddamn bridge.
[04:59.19]Somebody just gave a bunch of money.
[05:00.15]Hey, Leon the Lion, rawr, thanks for the 40 bucks.
[05:07.82]Take my fucking money, Jeremy, I love you.
[05:10.38]Damn.
[05:12.50]Thank you, dude, thanks for the, thanks for the 40 fucking dollars.
[05:16.59]Thank you, dude.
[05:17.67]Also, Benny Jets gave $15, where is my wood stream?
[05:20.91]It was raining out today.
[05:23.96]Yes, this is the definitive edition.
[05:26.14]This is not the regular edition.
[05:27.32]This is the definitive edition.
[05:30.48]Let's start the main story here.
[05:33.72]Sleeping Dogs.
[05:34.16]This is True Crime 3, essentially.
[05:42.03]Opening cutscene.
[05:44.01]Sleeping Dogs.
[05:44.99]I've never played it before.
[05:45.83]I've heard about it.
[05:49.83]Yeah, actually, it is raining outside.
[05:51.45]I can't go outside with electronic.
[05:53.56]I mean, is it the spiritual side?
[05:56.08]Jeremy, quiet.
[05:56.68]Yeah, I heard the game's fantastic, so I'm looking forward to it.
[06:26.96]Yeah, you got the money?
[06:31.38]We gotta play them all in the series.
[06:38.10]Can we have our brains back?
[06:43.31]Ants here.
[06:44.45]Look, I can get you three, four keys a week if you want.
[06:48.98]Hey, my shit's not good enough for you?
[06:51.21]This guy's like cold. He's like blowing his nose.
[07:29.20]Why would you ever do something like that?
[07:33.21]Ooh!
[07:33.43]From the cutscene, into the game.
[07:35.87]What are you doing?
[07:38.93]What?
[07:40.10]Why?
[07:40.58]Oh my god, fucking the goddamn controller!
[07:45.37]Turned off!
[07:49.73]Why?
[07:51.45]That doesn't even make any sense.
[07:53.35]Okay, hold A to sprint.
[07:57.40]Sure thing.
[07:59.78]What a way to take somebody out of a fucking game, man.
[08:02.26]What the hell?
[08:03.84]Don't ever buy a house, okay?
[08:05.74]Never buy a house!
[08:14.14]Climb up this?
[08:14.73]Yep.
[08:16.23]That's cool.
[08:16.63]This is parkour in the game.
[08:18.31]Is there running punches?
[08:21.55]There's running shoves.
[08:24.41]Apparently he's trying to be a pain in the ass here.
[08:36.60]What are we doing?
[08:39.41]We just like ran through the lobster shack.
[08:45.53]Oh, that was cool.
[08:46.33]That guy had a lot of time, but it was still an interesting action movie sequence.
[08:52.35]Come on, get up there.
[08:55.89]Oh, I didn't know I was gonna Hulk smash the thing.
[09:05.20]Why did I do an Iron Man entrance?
[09:07.28]Who do I think I am, Thor?
[09:13.72]Hey, there's a house party.
[09:19.50]Wait, hold on a second.
[09:23.86]Can I get like a drink?
[09:24.72]Nope, that's a cup.
[09:26.10]Don't fuck this up.
[09:26.98]It's the opening sequence.
[09:28.71]That shit party broke up.
[09:33.19]Cops are here!
[09:36.56]Aw shit man, my parents are gonna be so pissed!
[09:39.36]I told you guys not to park in the cul-de-sac!
[09:41.43]You're supposed to park behind the fucking house!
[09:44.19]Ugh, idiots!
[09:58.37]starring Will Yun Lee.
[10:01.61]Hey, man, I told you, next week, okay?
[10:05.87]Okay?
[10:06.49]Wei?
[10:07.68]Wei Shen?
[10:08.50]It's Jackie from Old Prosperity, man.
[10:11.16]Oh, shit.
[10:12.30]Jackie Ma.
[10:13.30]It is you.
[10:14.62]I can't fucking believe it.
[10:16.04]What are you doing here?
[10:16.84]When did you get back?
[10:17.92]Emma Stone is in this?
[10:20.33]Man, you look like shit.
[10:22.21]Hey, fuck you.
[10:22.89]You know, 15 years to do that.
[10:26.05]You know, we're not kids anymore.
[10:27.88]Whatever, man.
[10:29.20]Ask anyone.
[10:30.24]Jackie Ma still looks good.
[10:32.02]Lucy Liu?
[10:32.54]This is like a fucking all-star cast.
[10:35.07]Good to see you.
[10:36.57]What the fuck?
[10:36.99]They finally deport your ass from the United States?
[10:38.27]Oh, that's right.
[10:38.59]They do this.
[10:39.59]All the true crime game.
[10:41.03]Is Christopher Walken in this game?
[10:42.39]He better be.
[10:44.13]Lock up.
[10:45.11]Home sweet home.
[10:46.70]So what'd they get you on?
[10:48.16]Nothing that'll stick.
[10:50.10]Well, don't let them pin any extra shit on you.
[10:52.46]Fuckers will try, let me tell you.
[10:54.58]Once they hear you're from Old Prosperity, it happens all the time.
[10:58.36]Hey, so you still in touch with any of the guys from there?
[11:00.31]A few, you know.
[11:01.41]People kind of go their separate ways, but...
[11:04.71]You remember Winston?
[11:05.63]He moved all the way up to Red Pole and the Sun on Yee.
[11:09.23]I've got a couple of things going with him right now, matter of fact.
[11:13.46]Red Pole and the Sun on Yee.
[11:15.78]Shit, Dog Eyes always said he'd be running that neighborhood.
[11:18.58]Dog Eyes is a Red Pole, too.
[11:20.70]He's still a total poke guy.
[11:22.87]He was the one who got Winston in.
[11:24.13]They were pretty tight back then, but now...
[11:28.72]Hey, wasn't Dog Eyes hanging with your sister?
[11:30.78]What are you talking about?
[11:32.58]There's no way I know who Perry Shen is?
[11:34.86]Hey, remember when we were kids and you stabbed Dog Eyes with a pen?
[11:38.29]You totally saved my ass that day.
[11:41.05]Oh, man, I gotta tell Richard that story.
[11:44.09]He was in all the Hatchet movies.
[11:46.81]Hatchet 1, Hatchet 2, Hatchet 3.
[11:48.16]I can't believe it.
[11:49.60]He was in that General Hospital, too.
[11:50.94]I loved that show.
[11:51.70]Hey, Jackie.
[11:55.40]So look, if you and Winston ever need help with any of that shit you got going on with him... I'm quiet?
[11:59.80]I'll turn myself up.
[12:00.82]Look me up when you get out.
[12:02.32]You'll just be like old times.
[12:08.64]He's literally not paying attention to the fly.
[12:10.46]Yes, I am.
[12:23.26]Alright, I did it.
[12:26.06]Seems that the evidence against you has failed to appear.
[12:29.92]How do you explain that?
[12:32.73]You must be a very dangerous man, Wei Shen.
[12:37.59]Yeah.
[12:40.89]No, he turned it off.
[12:42.21]That means he's going to punch me.
[12:44.86]I trust that my men weren't too rough on you, officer.
[12:47.64]You might ask them the same question, sir.
[12:49.50]Those guys are out of shape.
[12:51.06]It paid off, though.
[12:51.80]I made contact with Jackie Ma.
[12:55.36]Good work.
[12:56.64]Use him to get close to Winston Chu.
[12:58.46]Do whatever it takes.
[12:59.80]Raymond here will be your handler.
[13:01.54]You'll report everything through him.
[13:03.81]What am I working for?
[13:04.37]Our intel suggests that Winston is looking for muscle.
[13:06.91]You need to find a way to make him trust you.
[13:08.71]I've done this before.
[13:09.75]Not in Hong Kong.
[13:11.17]American gangs, even Asian ones, don't compare to the Triads here.
[13:14.33]The Sun On Yee is the most powerful gang- Look, Raymond.
[13:17.11]Your name is Raymond, right?
[13:18.41]Yes.
[13:18.89]I grew up with these guys.
[13:20.31]I know who they are, what they are.
[13:22.17]All the intel reports in the world won't give you that.
[13:24.26]We want the Red Poles, the lieutenants like Winston, all of them.
[13:28.12]And most of all, the Dragonhead.
[13:29.92]Candidly, Wei, previous attempts to get close to him haven't panned out.
[13:36.22]We don't have much to go on.
[13:37.40]You're a cop, yeah, I know.
[13:38.12]That's why you're here.
[13:39.68]You're the inside man.
[13:40.38]Alright, get me on the street.
[13:41.58]What does this take place?
[13:42.78]Cincinnati?
[13:43.64]Somewhere in Ohio?
[14:03.70]Respectfully, sir.
[14:04.40]Are you sure about him?
[14:05.98]He'll be under extreme stress maybe for a very long time.
[14:08.52]Now, I'm not sure he has the discipline to hold up.
[14:11.05]According to the file, he has a history of... Hong Kong Ohio, okay.
[14:14.01]Extreme behavior.
[14:14.83]Yes.
[14:15.79]And an astonishing number of convictions.
[14:17.45]He obviously blames it twice for what happened to his family.
[14:20.37]It could turn into a vendetta.
[14:21.53]Raymond, Wei Shen is perfect for this job.
[14:34.35]Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[14:37.21]Aw, come on.
[14:37.77]You didn't start, like, the opening cutscene credits there.
[14:39.73]With the title card.
[14:40.99]Fuck.
[14:41.17]Next year?
[14:41.51]When does this take place?
[14:42.73]Come on, let's get out of here.
[15:01.84]Alright.
[15:03.30]Oh.
[15:04.14]This game is very pretty.
[15:05.86]When did this come out?
[15:06.99]Look at the atmosphere.
[15:07.87]Look at those fresh ducks.
[15:22.11]Sprint.
[15:22.75]Doesn't know what a joke is.
[15:25.17]I'm just kidding.
[15:26.59]I know this takes place in like 1993.
[15:28.19]I'm curious to see FOV.
[15:29.61]I don't think I can.
[15:30.51]This is just a cutscene walk, guys.
[15:32.17]This is not the real game.
[15:52.84]Uh-oh.
[15:53.46]Yeah, fuck this guy.
[15:54.92]Hey, and this guy over here?
[15:56.70]Don't worry.
[15:57.06]We're about to teach him how to use the buttons.
[16:00.90]No, don't do that, man.
[16:02.17]Get the fuck out of here.
[16:03.57]You sure?
[16:05.85]Yeah, that's the throw button.
[16:07.13]That's A and B at the same time.
[16:09.27]I'll teach you in two seconds.
[16:10.25]See, watch.
[16:26.91]I like that.
[16:30.37]Kick.
[16:31.31]Oh, there's a kick.
[16:33.81]Oh, I love this.
[16:34.69]Oh, I love this.
[16:44.10]Just like this, just the chain attacks.
[16:47.22]This is going to be game of the fucking century.
[16:49.38]I can already feel it.
[16:55.61]Oh.
[16:58.17]They got ragdolls in this game too.
[17:02.83]That was fun.
[17:05.01]Are you sure you're ready?
[17:06.59]Check out why this time, man.
[17:08.99]Okay, let's try it.
[17:11.33]Let me tell you, it's why, why, why.
[17:13.97]Oh no, it's grappled.
[17:21.03]So it's block.
[17:22.31]Press B to grapple a blocking enemy.
[17:24.05]Okay, you just grab.
[17:24.96]You can strike, you can throw.
[17:33.42]That was like judo throws.
[17:34.83]This is great.
[17:41.35]You can do trips too.
[17:47.21]Fuck you!
[17:48.57]This is great.
[17:57.78]Throw him into the wall.
[18:00.80]Directional matters as well.
[18:04.12]Betcha I learn new moves too.
[18:05.36]I'm gonna be obsessed with this game.
[18:07.18]I can already tell you that I like this game.
[18:08.50]It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[18:12.12]Slam the shutter down on the thug.
[18:13.99]Environmental grapple.
[18:19.01]Holy shit.
[18:21.83]What did they do to you in America?
[18:23.55]You became crazy.
[18:24.72]I look nasty.
[18:26.92]You okay?
[18:29.68]Yeah, I'm okay.
[18:32.35]He went to America and became an absolute monster.
[18:36.02]That was cool.
[18:38.80]Play the DLC that comes with this edition.
[18:41.36]I mean, I have the definitive edition.
[18:47.05]So I might as well play it.
[18:56.36]Well, I'm a cop, so.
[18:57.18]Oh, fuck.
[18:57.52]I mean, just kidding, huh?
[18:59.42]Just waiting for that to happen in a game.
[19:03.06]That'd be the best way to, like, make sure people knew you weren't a cop.
[19:06.74]Don't you think?
[19:22.90]I've been on vacation.
[19:24.24]I've been on vacation.
[19:24.94]You know, I'm a cop, and you're all under arrest.
[19:28.66]And then everyone, like, high-fives you, and then you're not a cop at that point.
[19:35.59]Better watch out.
[19:37.29]All that cocaine in the back is going to be confiscated by me and my police buddies.
[19:41.35]And then, like, grab your glasses and push them forward, push them back, push them forward.
[19:44.49]Like, yeah, yeah, like Groucho Marx.
[19:48.66]Wait a minute.
[19:53.03]I do remember you.
[19:55.25]You had a sister, right?
[19:57.65]Yeah, Mimi.
[20:00.51]Mimi Shen.
[20:02.66]I remember her.
[20:04.58]It's a good idea.
[20:06.48]No offense.
[20:07.74]Where is she now?
[20:16.08]She's dead.
[20:19.30]Sorry.
[20:20.78]Oh, you see her.
[20:23.46]So.
[20:24.40]That's not good.
[20:25.49]That's not good at all.
[20:27.19]You feel us?
[20:28.73]I'm just crazy.
[20:29.99]Try capable.
[20:33.43]We'll see.
[20:35.51]Conroy.
[20:37.43]You know that problem we got in the market?
[20:40.19]Why don't you take way with you?
[20:45.23]This guy's jacked.
[20:46.89]That guy looks like a WWE wrestler in a video game.
[20:54.56]I already learned the tutorial.
[20:57.78]Oh, come on.
[20:59.02]Yeah, I have to prove myself.
[21:00.28]Alright.
[21:00.46]Counter his strikes.
[21:01.10]Press Y so it's Batman.
[21:18.01]Okay.
[21:19.33]So it really is Batman.
[21:21.55]It's true crime.
[21:22.33]Streets of Batman.
[21:23.11]Do it again.
[21:24.90]Yeah, I have to do it.
[21:26.60]I have to do what it says.
[21:27.48]Survive the hazing.
[21:28.68]Mm-hmm.
[21:29.78]Oh, that guy can't block.
[21:48.40]Survive for 27 seconds.
[21:55.92]It's actually harder than Batman, because I don't think you can automatically block everything.
[22:02.92]Remember in Batman or in Shadow of Mordor, as long as you... It doesn't matter where you're standing.
[22:09.56]You could be across the street, and if you press Y at the right time, you will block everything.
[22:13.21]That hurt.
[22:19.86]Oh, I went... Place this at x2 speed.
[22:27.46]No.
[22:28.60]And it was just getting interesting, too.
[22:33.98]Winston, my old friend.
[22:36.81]So good to see you.
[22:38.01]This game has costumes and they show up in cutscenes.

[22:58.68]I'm gonna like this game a lot, so I'm sad that it's eventually gonna be over.
[23:01.75]That's why I haven't played this game.
[23:02.79]This game came out like six years ago.
[23:04.33]I've been putting it off because I knew I was gonna love it.
[23:05.75]Excuse me!
[23:19.17]Excuse me, I'm a cop.
[23:20.53]Don't you talk like that.

[30:09.83]I can't wait to do, like, the running karate kick.
[30:12.35]Look at that money.
[30:17.60]Everybody turns so quickly in this game.
[30:25.43]They really do.
[30:26.35]At least so far.
[30:28.77]I'm not gonna pay.
[30:29.73]Fuck you!
[30:30.95]Meteor generates halfway while out of combat.
[30:33.15]Buy food and drinks to heal fully.

[31:00.43]What the fuck?
[31:00.89]Man, I love it!
[31:02.21]I love it!
[31:18.56]Get the fuck out of here.
[31:22.26]I heard a noise, sorry.
[31:26.36]You can run and throw.
[31:27.92]You can run and throw in this game.
[31:34.73]That's unbelievable.
[31:36.73]Best addition I've ever seen in a video game.
[31:38.63]The sprint throw.
[31:43.41]Now get your face bitten by the crabs.
[31:51.15]Well, we got a little bit of an issue with him, but... You can put people in car trunks?
[31:56.13]Oh, this is... Thank you, sir.
[32:05.78]Go to the clothing stall.
[32:06.86]Hold on, there's more to see.
[32:08.36]I need to eat something.
[32:10.46]No, I don't.
[32:11.42]Wait!
[32:11.88]Everyone told me to get a pork bun.
[32:13.72]Here's my opportunity to get it.
[32:14.76]Let's see.
[32:25.65]I love how you can move your head around in cutscenes.
[32:27.33]What is this?
[32:28.17]A pork bun?
[32:29.45]A purse.
[32:29.87]Should I return the purse?
[32:32.13]Who dropped this purse?
[32:34.57]Oh, shit.
[32:35.99]Hey, wait.
[32:36.51]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[32:37.37]Here, there's probably purse.
[32:38.85]There's probably money in this purse.
[32:40.13]Just take it.
[32:41.13]How do I throw?
[32:42.08]How do I drop?
[32:44.38]Oh, shit.
[32:46.62]Just take the money.
[32:48.98]Oh, goddammit.
[32:49.82]What was Nick doing there, huh?
[32:59.09]Hey, hey, whoa, easy!
[33:00.27]Somebody knocked this whole stall down.
[33:09.30]LT... Left trigger and right trigger is thrown.
[33:12.24]Oh, dude, this is too many games.
[33:15.35]Why did it take me this long to play the best game ever made?
[33:17.49]Alright.
[33:21.29]Let's see.
[33:21.81]Torso.
[33:25.91]This is a shirt that I would wear in real life.
[33:29.54]Those little, like, short Vs. Alright, pants.
[33:35.26]J-J jigglers?
[33:38.74]I mean, I kind of want these.
[33:41.81]I would wear this in real life!
[33:44.25]Canvas sneakers.
[33:46.67]Oh shit, I'm running out of money.
[33:49.87]Wait, this... Minor thug clothing set active.
[33:52.64]You can now do plus 5% melee damage.
[33:56.94]What?
[34:00.45]Okay.
[34:02.51]Hats.
[34:03.95]Baseball caps.
[34:04.75]Yeah, let me put that on.
[34:07.01]Chains.
[34:07.47]I don't have enough money.
[34:08.41]Bracelets.
[34:08.85]What does that do?
[34:10.17]Wear this accessory to receive plus 5% bonus face XP.
[34:13.20]What the hell does that mean?
[34:19.16]Only a minor thug.
[34:21.00]Hey, well, that's fine.
[34:23.96]This is my outfit pretty much every day.
[34:28.41]I wear the minor thug outfit.
[34:33.20]Did he take the purse?
[34:39.27]Ice cream.
[34:41.09]That was awesome, man.
[34:42.19]All this teen, teen, teen.
[34:43.59]It's like you were born to do this.
[34:44.89]Did they say cash?
[34:47.27]You want to tell her what's going on?
[34:48.85]Faces his reputation?
[34:49.85]Okay, cool.
[34:50.65]Yeah?
[34:51.45]What'd you see?
[34:52.19]I tell you what I didn't see.
[34:54.59]I just look at Sims 3 character.
[34:58.50]I'm watching you, new guy.
[35:01.32]Sims 3.
[35:01.67]I really do like those pants, I'm not gonna lie.
[35:29.79]I'm a big fan of squishy pants.
[35:32.73]Ladies and gentlemen, case in point.
[35:35.66]I'm wearing them right now!
[35:41.48]Alright, pay attention.
[35:42.26]Cop and triad scoring.
[35:43.20]Cop and triad scores award you with experience toward your next level.
[35:47.28]Gain levels to purchase new upgrades.
[35:50.62]So, you can either get a cop score or a triad score.
[35:53.56]Is it different trees?
[35:55.93]Different skill trees?
[35:59.91]So the more that I'm a bad cop, the more that I get points or something.
[36:05.17]What's going on with my controller here?
[36:06.49]Come on then.
[36:09.01]Turn it again.
[36:10.05]Okay.
[36:14.57]Do a favor for the vendor.
[36:16.81]Favors.
[36:17.27]Gain face by doing favors for people.
[36:24.97]Sure.
[36:25.49]What do you need?
[36:27.11]I will take a pair of socks.
[36:30.34]Hurry.
[36:30.54]Okay.
[36:30.72]Let's head to the restaurant and pay.
[36:33.06]Do I get anything from this?
[36:35.05]I guess I just get reputation for being a good person.
[36:58.72]Alright, if somebody was in this kind of hurry, in this kind of a calm environment, this guy's really gotta go to the bathroom.
[37:05.01]This guy's gonna shit his pants.
[37:05.97]Oh god, oh god, oh god, I gotta go to the bathroom.
[37:08.99]Where is it?
[37:09.29]Where is it?
[37:09.67]Where's the bathroom?
[37:10.09]Is it in here?
[37:10.79]Hey, do you have a bathroom?
[37:11.51]No, you don't.
[37:12.03]Fuck, you don't have a public restroom.
[37:13.95]Oh shit, these guys gotta go to the bathroom too!
[37:19.31]Oh, you get a face meter.
[37:22.95]Get the fuck over here!
[37:31.09]What about you?
[37:32.15]Excuse me!
[37:36.51]Don't think so.
[37:40.77]So what does this do now?
[37:42.45]When it glows, you... you immediate enemies.
[37:45.61]You intimidate enemies and regain health.
[37:47.83]Okay.
[37:50.67]Oh, you can actually hit both people at the same time?
[37:55.49]Break his neck.
[38:03.81]I love the run.
[38:04.59]It's so great.
[38:10.63]Oh, I gotta stop doing that.
[38:19.31]See you later.
[38:19.65]Oh, that would've been sick if I hit that guy from behind.
[38:29.10]Hold?
[38:29.40]Wait, what does that mean?
[38:31.52]I can hold it down?
[38:34.22]And what does it mean?
[38:34.84]What do I do?
[38:36.52]I'm not sure what that means, but okay.
[38:41.36]That... What is it?
[38:43.38]Is it a bad guy?
[38:46.26]No, it's not.
[38:46.96]Okay, he's fine, though.
[38:47.72]All I did is, like, broke his back in three places.
[38:50.06]He'll be fine.
[38:50.52]He's just pretending to be asleep.
[38:55.83]I was like her son.
[38:56.67]Oh, hold B. Let's pick him up off the ground.
[38:59.53]Okay, cool.
[39:02.85]Favor complete.
[39:14.88]Did you like that?
[39:16.62]I got more tricks like that up my sleeve.
[39:23.80]Fucking register.
[39:27.63]It's a light register.
[39:29.23]Can I pick up the water cooler?
[39:38.37]What is this?
[39:38.83]Oh, wait, ah!
[39:40.31]This is a... I guess this is a check.
[39:41.99]We can go here.
[39:43.59]It's all made out of paper.
[39:45.67]jermaOn table.
[39:46.57]Where's my sauce?
[39:47.44]Where's my Szechuan sauce?
[40:04.84]Did I ever get the TF2 items for this game?
[40:08.13]You know what's weird about what you just said?
[40:09.99]I might actually own sleeping dogs.
[40:12.55]And I bought this.
[40:39.13]I actually may have pre-ordered sleeping dogs for the items.
[40:42.62]And I bought this, because I forgot I owned it.
[40:44.64]No, no, I don't own it.
[40:46.26]I don't, I definitely don't.
[40:47.06]What's he making over here?
[40:53.16]I'd like to examine the environment.
[40:54.47]Hey, he's just heating up the oil, that's all.
[41:03.43]Trying to, like, burn this guy's hand.
[41:08.26]Not gonna work.
[41:13.63]pirated the game.
[41:14.51]I don't pirate games.
[41:16.17]Whoa, look at this.
[41:16.85]It's like a whole restaurant.
[41:17.77]What a living and breathing world.
[41:21.64]I just need to examine.
[41:22.62]I like to look at stuff.
[41:24.08]I like to see the animation work and everything like that.
[41:25.98]I'm a weirdo, guys.
[41:27.00]I like to really explore.
[41:31.86]Nice.
[41:32.84]That is a very hot bowl of soup.
[41:35.66]That probably hurts eating that.
[41:38.05]Beat up a chef?
[41:38.69]I can't throw a punch in here.
[41:43.75]Ask Quan for Ming's whereabouts.
[41:46.79]Police reports.
[41:47.35]As you progress through the game, you'll unlock new police reports.
[41:50.43]Use your phone to access them.
[41:54.08]Okay.
[41:57.72]Locked.
[42:00.56]Field report.
[42:01.16]Winston Chu.
[42:01.96]That's all I got.
[42:04.28]I just take pictures of people and write about them in my diary.
[42:06.28]Okay.
[42:36.38]That false sprint into somebody.
[42:39.40]Dragon kick.
[42:39.98]I'm good.
[42:40.68]Let's just keep going.
[42:42.05]Veggies!
[42:42.95]Hey, you got a favor for me?
[42:45.91]Thanks, man.
[42:47.75]Appreciate it.
[42:49.03]Confront Ming.
[43:03.80]No, that's not him.
[43:05.30]He's around the corner.
[43:05.88]Is there a hide button?
[43:06.96]Is there a crouch button?
[43:07.93]Maybe not.
[43:10.13]Wait, is it right there?
[43:11.05]Alright.
[43:12.07]Let's do this correctly.
[43:14.01]Without him seeing us.
[43:20.17]Ah, damn it.
[43:20.57]It's a cutscene.
[43:22.86]I was gonna sprint kick him.
[43:25.44]That's how I do it.
[43:26.76]I act the same way.
[43:33.68]Are you sure this is not another player?
[43:37.54]Whoa.
[43:39.94]Oh, clumsy.
[43:43.14]What is with this clumsiness?
[43:46.57]Don't worry, I got a good shot here.
[43:52.01]I actually got him in the leg.
[43:54.27]Come on.
[43:54.71]Anybody got any more groceries?
[43:55.69]Excuse me.
[44:06.03]What?
[44:07.19]Why would that hit the lady?
[44:10.45]Oh my god.
[44:12.25]Well that... that hurts.
[44:18.25]Can I pick up any more stuff?
[44:19.21]Why would I jump over that when I can run to the right of it?
[44:26.68]You know, it's funny.
[44:27.14]I would've done the same thing he just did.
[44:28.86]Grab random people and throw at guy.
[44:34.35]I got a pig in his hands.
[44:42.10]Alright, here we go.
[44:44.38]What environmental fun stuff are we gonna do?
[44:49.26]Violent actions against enemies increase your score.
[44:51.24]Yeah.
[44:53.44]Fine, keep blocking.
[44:58.11]Whoa!
[44:59.21]Interesting.
[45:02.40]Oh, we're gonna fan this guy.
[45:03.90]Get over here.
[45:06.58]Into the fan.
[45:07.38]Cut his brain in half.
[45:08.52]Aww, come on.
[45:10.92]Right in the chest.
[45:21.11]Throw a guy into the dumpster.
[45:26.99]There we go.
[45:29.20]That- there's a- oh, that's- whoa!
[45:31.82]Secret entrance.
[45:37.22]Where'd he get the knife?
[45:39.96]Oh, you're gonna- oh god, yeah, yeah, see, you're going right down.
[45:46.73]I'm gonna chokeslam mankind into the middle of the ring from the top of the cell.
[45:50.53]Come on.
[45:52.71]Here we go.
[45:54.33]Shit, come on.
[46:00.83]I gotta get that done.
[46:08.68]I'm like so focused on that I don't care about anything else.
[46:10.42]Come on!
[46:11.68]Get in there!
[46:12.10]Come on!
[46:13.86]I don't think I can.
[46:20.00]I don't think I can do that.
[46:21.40]That's unfortunate.
[46:22.40]Okay, time to focus.
[46:24.45]Put him in the toilet.
[46:32.42]Can I throw him over the balcony?
[46:42.40]Nah.
[46:48.95]Can I put them both in there?
[46:49.99]Alright, here we go.
[46:54.57]Well, nevermind.
[46:57.29]I gotta throw this guy in here.
[46:59.83]Oh, no.
[47:01.43]That's not cool.
[47:02.17]I love when they just repeat themselves.
[47:12.98]It's so great.
[47:19.13]You fucking bitch.
[47:20.19]You fucking bitch.
[47:21.09]You fucking bitch.
[47:24.67]He's done?
[47:29.80]Alright, give me that knife.
[47:35.37]That guy's still stuck in there.
[47:38.11]Alright, you're going into the fucking tube sock.
[47:42.17]I don't have a badge?
[47:59.28]Hold on a second.
[48:00.29]I can't just be like, hey, hey, buddy, scan my tattoo on my back.
[48:07.51]You have quite a rap sheet here.
[48:09.25]Multiple arrests in San Francisco, alleged ties to organized crime.
[48:13.15]And now you're here enforcing for the sun on you.
[48:17.37]You know, you don't have to throw your life away like this.
[48:21.01]You're undercover?
[48:22.35]You still have a badge.
[48:24.25]I still have a giant, like, Hong Kong Police Department badge in my pocket.
[48:29.87]Dude, I gotta... If I was this...
[48:40.83]You know what I'm saying?
[48:41.36]I would have, like, all my guys have there be, like, a totally understanding protocol where you got, like, a tattoo on your asshole.
[48:49.98]You know what I mean?
[48:51.21]So, like, you had to bend over and, like, spread your asshole and, like, there's the police tattoo.
[48:55.53]That way it could be so easy to determine who's who.
[48:58.67]One of us.
[48:59.45]See?
[48:59.91]Look at this.
[49:00.49]What?
[49:00.77]Jesus, Pandrew.
[49:01.69]Let me get the door.
[49:02.56]There are a few badges outside who didn't hear you.
[49:04.48]It's alright, Wade.
[49:05.50]See, you don't even have to have a conversation about it.
[49:07.48]I just met her.
[49:08.48]Congratulations, Tang, so now you know.
[49:10.38]You could have a police asshole tattoo so people would know that you were a police officer.
[49:15.42]Yeah, it doesn't seem like I have much of a choice.
[49:18.45]No, no, you don't.
[49:20.41]Now see yourself out.
[49:21.33]Permission to speak freely.
[49:22.53]Denied.
[49:24.55]You need to be more careful, Wade.
[49:26.65]Much more careful.
[49:28.23]I can't bail you out like this again.
[49:30.64]I don't want to hear it.
[49:32.76]Just be careful.
[49:35.80]But, like, a tattoo, like, under your tongue or something that says, like, the eagle has landed, like, underneath your tongue.
[49:42.52]So let's go, like, lift up your tongue, please.
[49:45.27]Who's going to have you do that in, like, the triads?
[49:48.45]You don't go to, like, a doctor's examination.
[49:49.99]Like, if you have, like, a little, like, one small symbol on, like, underneath your tongue to determine that you're an officer...
[49:56.91]You could make something up.
[49:57.71]You could be like, they could be like, oh, what's that under your tongue?
[50:00.11]What is that symbol?
[50:00.77]You could be like, I don't know.
[50:01.56]I got drunk and my girlfriend at the time thought it was fun.
[50:04.12]I got mom's level one.
[50:08.18]I got an apartment.
[50:14.62]Until they find out.
[50:27.36]I'm covered in tattoos anyway.
[50:28.50]You don't think I would have one under my tongue?
[50:38.59]That wouldn't be against the realm of possibility to have, like, an under-tongue tattoo.
[50:43.85]Your apartment contains a bed, wardrobe, and CCTV that can access hacked cameras.
[50:49.22]Cool.
[50:51.76]I don't think I have any other clothes.
[50:52.88]I don't have the...
[50:56.73]I don't want to lose my bonus.
[51:03.60]No, I'm not doing the thing.
[51:05.14]I'm not doing the streamer joke.
[51:07.72]Like the YouTuber joke and going around naked.
[51:12.30]No.
[51:12.70]That's like, everybody's done that probably.
[51:14.43]You've probably seen that a hundred times.
[51:18.35]Like, oh my god, he's in his underwear running around!
[51:20.43]I'm not doing that anymore.
[51:23.89]I'll put up your map.
[51:27.98]Cycle through primary objectives.
[51:29.52]Okay.
[51:32.20]So we got a vehicle store and then stick up and delivery.
[51:37.48]New case available over here.
[51:39.46]And there's a couple of... Let's see.
[51:40.95]What is this?
[51:41.29]New case.
[51:43.33]This is cool.
[51:46.57]Yeah.
[51:47.53]I'm a 30 plus year old man.
[51:49.19]I'm mature now.
[51:49.85]Understand?
[51:52.71]Understand?
[51:55.29]I've grown up a lot in the last five to ten years.
[51:58.75]I don't get cheap laughs anymore from things that aren't funny.
[52:25.51]That's a very short pee.
[52:27.73]He's not peeing all the way.
[52:30.05]Let it all out, man.
[52:31.31]You don't- nobody pees for five seconds.
[52:34.44]Hold on, I'm gonna count.
[52:38.32]One.
[52:39.30]Two.
[52:40.24]Three.
[52:41.28]Four.
[52:43.84]That would hurt your- that would hurt.
[52:45.19]You know how much physical pain you would fucking be in?
[52:49.68]If you cut it short, it hurts.
[52:53.41]Nobody pees for like three or four seconds.
[52:58.17]Look at how mature I'm being.
[53:00.27]What else we got?
[53:02.54]I see this guy also has problems with fucking like animals in his wall.
[53:07.30]What's in here?
[53:09.82]Soda?
[53:10.10]That's all I got?
[53:21.65]It goes right through me, man.
[53:22.69]Those energy drinks.
[53:23.89]All these millennials in our energy drinks.
[53:25.47]It goes right through us.
[53:31.49]Why would you throw the can on the ground?
[53:32.77]Oh, what do we do?
[53:39.77]Yeah, what's this?
[53:41.47]Sunkissed orange energy drink juice?
[53:43.96]Oh, I love these.
[53:59.40]Let's go.
[54:00.88]Get me out of here.
[54:03.16]I know, I'm sorry.
[54:04.05]Let's go.
[54:05.81]I made the joke about making the joke about me making a joke five years ago about me making the joke now doing the joke.
[54:12.21]Doing the thing that I made the joke about.
[54:13.97]Oh shit!
[54:21.26]Okay, that guy was on the wrong side of the walking road.
[54:23.50]Speak to the parking attendant to get your vehicle.
[54:28.73]It's like paint job.
[54:31.71]That's gotta be my twitch.tv YouTube colors, right?
[54:38.44]Green?
[54:40.94]Is it only green and red?
[54:42.46]So it's a Christmas bike.
[54:43.42]Okay.
[54:43.72]Well, I want green.
[54:45.38]Because green is the color of intelligence.
[54:50.07]Oh boy.
[54:57.07]It's like I've never ridden a motorcycle before.
[55:00.39]Okay, just take it easy now.
[55:06.66]Okay, that was fun.
[55:07.30]This is like when you have a friend that has never rode a bike before.
[55:12.00]Yeah, stuff like that will happen too.
[55:14.00]When you have a friend that's never ridden on a motorcycle before, they do this around the corner like this.
[55:19.74]Okay.
[55:21.01]Yup.
[55:21.87]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[55:23.83]Alright, man, that was fun.
[55:24.71]Cool bike, dude.
[55:26.21]Yeah, how much was it?
[55:26.85]Like 12 grand?
[55:28.31]Nice, man.
[55:28.83]Nice, nice, nice.
[55:29.39]Yeah, I'm good, though.
[55:30.49]That's what I would do.
[55:32.07]Where are we going?
[55:37.32]This way?
[55:39.66]Am I standing up on the bike?
[55:41.62]How do I stop this?
[55:44.86]Wait a minute.
[55:45.54]Wait, you can stand on the bike?
[55:49.36]Are you shitting me?
[55:52.03]How do I jump off the bike like this?
[55:53.33]This is so cool.
[56:00.77]This is so cool.
[56:04.22]I'm hooked.
[56:11.70]This is great.
[56:12.96]Okay, well, I don't even remember what the hell I was supposed to be doing.
[56:15.42]Going this way, I think.
[56:16.22]Okay, that's how you look behind you.
[56:20.92]That's the brake.
[56:22.28]The emergency brake is B. Stand-on bike is A. I'm not sure what jump-off bike is.
[56:33.29]Oh my god, that's so cool.
[56:34.79]What the hell was that?
[56:38.61]What was that?
[56:41.81]What is it trying to get me to do?
[56:43.27]What is... I... I can jump into other cars?
[56:52.76]Don't even fucking tell me that, man.
[56:57.34]I need to take a little bit of time to explore for a minute and just have a little bit of fun.
[57:00.53]You gotta be kidding me.
[57:02.05]This is insane.
[57:02.65]Oh my god.
[57:18.36]Wow.
[57:20.10]This is going to be fun.
[57:22.50]I can do it to any car.
[57:24.53]Can I do it from bike to bike?
[57:30.01]Game of the year for a seven-year-old game.
[57:32.07]Yeah, that's fine.
[57:35.43]I'm allowed to have my opinions on the video game industry.
[57:42.19]Can I do it from here?
[57:43.66]Wait, I need to see.
[57:44.42]I want to do it.
[57:47.04]Where's he going?
[57:51.69]He was going this way.
[57:55.14]Oh, whatever.
[57:57.30]You can do it in cars, you can do it... That's so f***ing cool.
[58:00.22]I was trying to tune to that bike.
[58:07.34]You gotta be going at least a certain speed, I guess.
[58:09.60]Let's go.
[58:10.31]Let's just head to the mission.
[58:21.09]That's so awesome though.
[58:28.61]Yeah.
[58:30.53]Let's do the mission.
[58:36.14]Wait, you okay, man?
[58:37.59]You look like someone took a shit on your face.
[58:40.89]Jackie, I'm just a little frustrated.
[58:43.01]This game was pretty popular, but still underrated.
[58:44.97]I was making serious bank back in the States.
[58:46.89]Come on, we're just paying our dues.
[58:49.51]Winston's a loyal guy.
[58:50.63]He'll hook us up when the time's right.
[58:52.44]You can't always wait for the world to hand you what you want.
[58:55.52]Sometimes, you gotta just take it.
[58:57.38]Totally, man.
[58:58.78]It's time to take a little initiative.
[59:01.42]Yellow clothing icons?
[59:02.43]I'll take a look.
[59:08.30]They have to be too fast or too quick.
[59:38.76]Are we doing bike or are we doing van?
[59:41.22]Looks like we're doing van.
[59:42.86]Drive to the warehouse.
[59:44.14]Sure thing.
[59:44.58]Oh, so there is.
[59:45.32]Okay.
[59:45.42]Drive safely out.
[60:04.74]There actually is a reason to drive safe in this game.
[60:07.40]You get points, but not crashing.
[60:09.40]Okay, I want to get some cop points here.
[60:11.32]What's a horn?
[60:12.50]Oh, that's not a horn.
[60:13.83]What is... Wait a minute.
[60:15.35]Oh, fuck.
[60:15.73]This is a different country.
[60:36.19]So, oh man, I gotta drive on the left side of the road.
[60:39.17]I'm not gonna be able to do that.
[60:49.23]This isn't a different country, and in Hong Kong they drive on the other side of the road.
[60:53.69]In fact, they drive on the other side of the road in most countries.
[60:58.00]Who am I playing as?
[61:01.60]I wasn't in this outfit.
[61:13.59]Do something.
[61:23.81]Brawlers can block your attacks grappled and... Hold on.
[61:31.03]I want to throw him in the trunk of the car or something.
[61:32.57]I guess not.
[61:34.97]Come here.
[61:36.63]Come here.
[61:37.15]Well, that didn't work.
[61:43.24]Whoops!
[61:46.54]Give him scoops, Lamb.
[61:53.41]Fire him, it's scary.
[61:54.33]Into the glass.
[62:03.79]Throw him.
[62:04.89]Can I throw him into the soccer pit?
[62:10.79]No, get him in the trash.
[62:16.12]Ooh.
[62:22.13]Right is right for a reason.
[62:23.79]What do you mean?
[62:28.77]See you later.
[62:29.19]I was going to say, can you block people with melee weapons?
[62:32.99]I guess you can.
[62:34.37]Ooh, hold on a minute.
[62:38.19]Don't hurt me.
[62:38.51]Don't hurt me.
[62:38.81]Don't hurt me.
[62:39.17]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[62:48.27]I'll take that.
[62:51.77]Wow, awesome.
[62:55.27]Ah, you blocked it.
[62:56.77]You stopped it.
[63:03.33]So I've hit him in the head so hard with that that I broke the thing.
[63:12.90]Just throw him into something.
[63:15.44]Just throw him.
[63:20.71]Step on his head until he's dead.
[63:27.13]America drives on the wrong side of the road.
[63:28.85]Get over it.
[63:29.77]That's the thing.
[63:32.51]I've only known... You know, I've only known the American way, and that's driving on the right side of the road, using the imperial system, and that's correct to me.
[63:43.24]That's right to me.
[63:45.32]And I think the issue is, if you really think about it,
[63:50.45]That's not wrong to me.
[63:52.84]But when the entire world does something differently, aren't you kind of the wrong one?
[63:58.92]You know what I'm saying?
[64:02.33]Like, that makes me wrong, right?
[64:04.67]Because we're the only ones that do that.
[64:10.23]First exit direction is ramp.
[64:15.80]The entire world we can drive on the left.
[64:18.53]That's true.
[64:19.07]You know, never mind.
[64:20.11]Forget everything I said.
[64:25.17]Okay, that's how you do it.
[64:36.79]Okay, now I understand.
[64:39.95]You actually have to press it together.
[64:43.55]Sorry for that guy.
[64:45.39]I get it.
[64:45.69]Alright.
[64:49.07]I thought it was hold left and press exit.
[64:50.62]It's both at the same time.
[64:57.50]It's just like a road rash.
[65:04.95]Now ram the cargo off the road.
[65:11.31]Whoa!
[65:11.79]I almost just jumped out of the car.
[65:17.46]It's like Ace Ventura.
[65:18.24]Remember Ace Ventura when he fucked up the windshield and he has to go like this to drive the car?
[65:24.63]I've done that before.
[65:26.53]I'm not kidding.
[65:26.97]I've actually done that before.
[65:27.85]I've had to because the window was so fogged up from being cold that I physically couldn't see.
[65:35.98]Come on!
[65:38.98]Oh, come on.
[65:40.76]Don't do this.
[65:49.47]Yeah, it was so foggy, and I was late to like a doctor's appointment or something.
[65:53.86]And why is this car on fire?
[66:00.20]I had to like do the Ace Ventura out the window.
[66:11.24]That's it, right?
[66:12.10]You're out.
[66:13.02]You're out.
[66:14.22]You're out.
[66:15.54]You're out!
[66:16.80]Oh my god.
[66:17.64]Get out of the batter's box.
[66:18.97]What the fuck are you doing?
[66:20.29]Okay.
[66:20.61]Jewelry?
[66:20.99]Jewelry?
[66:38.48]Drive to the imports.
[66:42.66]Tag.
[66:43.88]Yeah, we're playing tag with cars.
[66:50.65]Escape cop radius for ram pursuers.
[66:55.61]Press X in any direction to ram.
[66:56.87]Alright, we got a distinct GTA.
[66:58.13]Can I ram backwards?
[67:03.05]I mean, this is kind of crazy, but this is not a cartoon.
[67:05.29]I can't ram backwards like Scooby-Doo.
[67:09.42]You cannot ram backwards like they do in Scooby-Doo.
[67:13.94]So I'm gonna wait.
[67:18.85]Not quite.
[67:19.29]Not enough power.
[67:26.65]There it is.
[67:29.07]There we are.
[67:30.39]This car drives like shit.
[67:34.09]Pull the emergency brake?
[67:35.19]No.
[67:35.91]I'm talking about, like, hop the car backwards.
[67:37.77]Speaking of which.
[67:39.63]We're going the wrong way.
[67:41.13]Other side of the highway.
[67:42.17]Mad because bad cop.
[67:59.61]The cars don't drive that well in the game?
[68:05.69]Probably pretty realistic.
[68:07.88]Can't just fly around like an asshole in any real life situation.
[68:11.40]There we are.
[68:18.92]Mission complete.
[68:27.19]I want to do that somebody I want to catch a criminal by driving slow next to him and smashing him with the door New accessory
[68:52.84]Alright.
[68:54.07]Almost.
[68:56.01]Oh, no.
[68:56.23]I'm there.
[68:58.91]Airbrushed dragon armored van.
[69:00.55]Fake Cambria watch.
[69:03.13]It's a fake watch.
[69:05.35]$20,000.
[69:05.47]Oh, by the way, that guy died and turned into a bike.
[69:09.99]So, that's cool.
[69:14.10]Unspent points.
[69:15.26]Cop upgrades.
[69:16.10]Receive the phone.
[69:19.04]He was a Slim Jim.
[69:23.67]What?
[69:24.61]You can eat Slim Jims in this game?
[69:26.25]Fast disarm.
[69:28.63]Counter enemy attacks.
[69:29.97]Strike resistance.
[69:32.59]The player takes reduced damage from enemy unarmed strikes.
[69:35.94]Extra damage for all striking attacks.
[69:37.86]I mean, the best offense is a sneeze.
[69:41.58]So when do I unlock that?
[69:43.84]Looks like... I'd say at some point up here.
[69:49.16]This looks like a sneeze to me.
[69:53.80]So let's go with this one.
[69:54.92]I want to do... Hold on.
[69:55.95]We can do cartwheels?
[69:58.75]Cool.
[69:59.39]Surprise exchange.
[70:00.75]Lock on and press A to roll over an enemy to... Okay, that's cool.
[70:03.81]I want that.
[70:05.03]Let's get the extra damage here.
[70:13.04]I caused too much collateral damage.
[70:15.24]I see.
[70:15.64]Okay.
[70:17.99]That makes sense.
[70:26.26]See ya, Moon!
[70:36.48]For a second, I thought that, I was like, what the fuck is this guy doing?
[70:39.42]That guy is making these singing songs.
[70:44.91]Need help?
[70:46.41]Hey, you're Song Yi, right?
[70:48.77]I was racing earlier, and I would have won.
[70:51.03]But this guy, Tommy Han Lan, he cheated.
[70:54.71]Ran me off the road at the last minute.
[70:56.79]Can you teach him a lesson?
[70:58.33]Keep him from doing it again?
[70:59.83]Sure thing.
[71:00.71]He's not far.
[71:01.95]Wreck his car.
[71:03.22]That'll teach him.
[71:04.46]Hey!
[71:04.98]Hey!
[71:06.06]Find the winner's race car before he leaves.
[71:08.98]What is over there?
[71:10.56]Alright, well, can I have your car?
[71:13.82]Just wreck it.
[71:14.44]I'm gonna fucking drive straight into it.
[71:16.56]I'm gonna drive directly into your car, man.
[71:22.08]Before he shows up.
[71:25.17]Fast.
[71:30.15]What's with these directions?
[71:31.73]Don't tell me to take a right-hand turn.
[71:34.05]This is 2010.
[71:36.11]My TomTom's giving me wrong info.
[71:39.43]Where's this car?
[71:50.08]Got a tire iron from the trunk.
[71:54.84]Alright.
[71:57.50]Destroy the car.
[71:58.72]Why don't I just take it?
[72:06.55]Smash it!
[72:07.83]Don't kick!
[72:08.37]Why would you kick when you have this?
[72:10.01]All the damage.
[72:11.55]You're on the back.
[72:12.79]Beat down the driver.
[72:13.87]Oh, goddammit.
[72:35.05]Let's do the thing he doesn't want most of all.
[72:40.39]Watch this.
[72:47.63]Do it again.
[72:51.30]Smashes.
[72:51.74]Yeah.
[72:52.44]Not only did we break the car, we fucked up his head too in the process.
[72:57.04]Nice.
[72:57.32]Okay.
[72:57.58]Now I want this.
[72:59.58]Can I just take the car now?
[73:06.01]Wait, give me the broom.
[73:08.63]Give me the broom.
[73:15.07]Oh!
[73:18.25]Come with me.
[73:19.92]You're a fucking witness.
[73:20.84]I can't let you tell anybody about this.
[73:28.40]Hey!
[73:29.22]What are you looking at?
[73:30.56]You're gonna get it here too.
[73:32.26]Never mind.
[73:32.68]I'm just kidding.
[73:33.10]Just get out.
[73:37.06]Is this guy's shit face?
[73:38.06]This guy sucks.
[73:38.70]Okay, nobody saw.
[74:01.20]Wait, no, no, no, wait a minute.
[74:02.42]That guy's gonna die in there.
[74:04.06]He's gonna die in there.
[74:05.50]I gotta let this guy out.
[74:07.68]No one's gonna know where he is.
[74:09.32]Come back, come on out.
[74:10.10]That was a funny Halloween prank.
[74:12.54]Okay, now, what can I do with you to make it so you're not gonna wake up for a little while?
[74:18.27]Just take a look.
[74:18.71]You're on camera.
[74:19.41]Just go, just stay back here.
[74:23.53]Okay, he's fine.
[74:28.82]I just pushed him into the back of the wall.
[74:30.18]He's alright.
[74:30.58]Alright, let's go.
[74:34.57]Oh, your time is up.
[74:35.67]My time is now.
[74:37.37]You can't see me.
[74:38.17]My time is now.
[74:41.07]John Cena.
[74:43.73]Did he die from that?
[74:46.87]I didn't break his skull.
[74:48.01]He's fine.
[74:49.49]Hey.
[74:49.67]Hey, what are you doing?
[74:53.20]I'm going to stop and get a snack.
[74:55.06]You want anything?
[74:57.46]Yeah, come on out.
[74:58.08]Tell me what you think if you like anything.
[75:02.26]Okay, yeah.
[75:03.24]My friend's gonna have a roasted pork sandwich.
[75:10.14]Wait, what?
[75:12.26]Am I getting arrested?
[75:13.48]No, you're under arrest.
[75:15.24]Not me.
[75:16.00]You're the one that's under arrest.
[75:18.26]Oh, shit.
[75:25.10]You're under arrest.
[75:27.92]Thanks for the gun.
[75:31.58]What am I fucking doing?
[75:32.46]Get out of here!
[75:41.20]Okay, I gotta like... I gotta get some good boy points here.
[75:46.78]I just Mazda trucked that guy.
[75:48.13]What were we doing?
[75:51.41]Invisible handcuffs?
[75:52.27]No, it's just we're doing some pantomiming.
[75:55.75]This car's pretty fast.
[75:59.44]I'm gonna lose him down an alley in three, two, one.
[76:04.90]Action!
[76:09.93]Action!
[76:10.31]Clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk.
[76:32.68]Alright, we're fine.
[76:38.63]Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[76:43.61]Do I have stars or something?
[76:45.39]I think I'm going to have to... I think I'm going to have to lose here.
[77:00.60]You can actually speed the car up like that.
[77:04.22]Catch me if you can.
[77:05.42]Time to beat.
[77:09.06]Minute 16.
[77:10.58]So wait, this is just... Am I getting money for this?
[77:17.86]Vehicle takedown streak.
[77:19.36]There's so many little things in this game.
[77:21.30]This is so cool.
[77:25.34]Don't blow up next to me.
[77:30.52]What the hell is that thing?
[77:31.32]Why is there a police ice cream truck over here?
[77:35.98]That thing's not fast enough.
[77:36.84]I don't think it'll do a U-turn.
[77:38.25]Yes, it is.
[77:38.51]Just a challenge.
[77:41.19]Okay, that's cool.
[77:46.61]I'm trying to lose him.
[77:47.63]I promise.
[77:48.55]Here we go.
[77:51.77]That does not take long at all.
[77:55.40]We've got a pedestrian in need up here.
[77:59.81]Clean drive.
[78:03.43]Beat 30 seconds, okay?
[78:04.55]Just don't get in any accidents.
[78:09.28]It's the easiest challenge I could have had.
[78:11.68]Oh, wait a minute.
[78:17.32]Is this pulling people from my friends list?
[78:23.24]Okay, I understand now.
[78:24.80]Alright, let's go.
[78:39.78]That's a nice car.
[78:41.78]How do I put the gun away to not be threatening?
[78:44.60]How do I... I gotta holster the gun.
[78:47.50]No, that's point gun.
[78:49.62]Oh, shit.
[78:50.56]How do I... I was never here.
[78:52.09]Okay, I just have to go in the car.
[79:08.27]Is it really that easy?
[79:10.20]It's not that easy, right?
[79:11.32]No one's gonna try to stop me?
[79:13.32]You'd think you'd get out of the way at this point.
[79:15.86]I'm sorry, man.
[79:16.56]You kind of deserve it at this point.
[79:40.30]Get out of here!
[79:47.00]I should probably turn off the music.
[80:00.21]That's one of my favorite features, man.
[80:02.74]Who's this?
[80:03.26]Something going on here?
[80:10.51]Gentlemen, something going on here?
[80:17.01]Looks like it.
[80:21.96]Really?
[80:22.22]Holy shit.

[81:27.74]Oh, that's cool.
[81:28.26]They just hide random things in the world.
[81:36.57]You know, he did get out of the trunk.
[81:37.45]He's still in there.
[81:39.07]Isn't he?
[81:39.33]Alright, there is like a good cop mission over here, right?
[81:44.11]Let's try it.
[81:49.78]It's a police officer mission.
[81:52.08]It eliminated all the thugs in the hangout.
[81:56.40]Okay.
[81:56.76]So it's just random cop missions?
[82:04.63]That's cool.
[82:05.91]He's gonna beat the shit out of people's sticks.
[82:14.58]They make it real easy when they give you a fucking weapon.
[82:21.75]I'm sorry.
[82:23.53]Officer on duty.

[82:57.85]Got some cop experience.
[83:00.09]So, I'm gonna tell you guys right now.
[83:02.35]There's no way I'm gonna get enough good boy points.
[83:07.05]I'm gonna have to do those missions every time I see them.
[83:08.77]Because I'll never level up to police.
[83:14.49]Um... Drop that purse, lady.
[83:23.72]Drop the purse.
[83:53.39]Okay, it's time to go.
[83:56.93]Funky!
[83:59.43]Oh, really?
[84:00.67]Alright, let's go, baby.
[84:04.45]This game's a lot of fun.
[84:06.11]I like this game a lot.
[84:10.92]Oh my god!
[84:26.72]Oh my god.
[84:27.46]That was crazy.
[84:33.02]Oh, I can't jump on his bike thing?
[84:37.92]Blood all over the street, yeah.
[84:39.32]He smashed my face in the back of a bus.
[84:43.89]Alright, I'm so stupid.
[84:47.13]For a second I was like, oh man, I'm gonna put somebody in the trunk of the motorcycle.
[84:49.61]Good luck.
[84:53.27]You got the right attitude.
[84:55.21]It's gonna pay off for you.
[84:56.89]You'll see.
[85:01.55]You know anything about the minibus racket?
[85:04.43]Same as everyone.
[85:05.29]If you want to drive a good route, pay the toll.
[85:07.75]That's right.
[85:09.19]You're old.
[85:09.43]You want to pick up on Marble Drive?
[85:11.83]The most profitable route in the whole fucking city.
[85:15.22]From now on... Sidecar?
[85:17.88]Thanks.
[85:18.22]I appreciate it, Winston.
[85:21.18]Dog eyes, Walt.

[85:23.18]This is on PC.
[85:24.24]This is the definitive edition.
[85:25.07]Let's go.
[85:38.25]I actually don't think they even sell the original Sleeping Dogs.
[85:41.85]Hold on.
[85:42.47]I have a bus full of people?
[85:44.35]Okay, that's kind of crazy.
[85:45.39]Please tell me that I can make people get on the bus.
[85:48.37]Can I fill the bus with people?
[85:49.41]What happens if I hold A down here?
[85:51.29]Can I open up the door?
[85:52.25]No.
[86:09.15]Oh, wait.
[86:09.45]Oh, I was supposed to drop him off.
[86:10.71]Okay, I get it.
[86:11.41]Drop him off.
[86:13.37]You got the definitive edition for $2.
[86:16.80]Good deal.
[86:17.32]Just drift around.
[86:17.76]Oh, this is just like Double Dash.
[86:41.41]I used to hold that button down and double dash.
[86:44.50]And just coast around.
[87:00.63]I don't know who's on my team.
[87:05.31]Are they all... Are these people all on my team?
[87:07.73]Didn't I get on the bus with three people?
[87:10.37]Oh, okay.
[87:10.75]There we go.
[87:14.24]I get it.
[87:14.52]Make sure I hold down left trigger.
[87:24.75]Hey, bullshit.
[87:28.46]Over the railing.
[87:30.38]Oh!
[87:31.76]Goddamn.
[87:34.84]Come on, I gotta Superman this guy.
[87:36.24]Into the phone booth.
[87:39.99]Hey, call collect next time.
[87:43.96]Funny joke beater.
[87:44.60]Funny joke beater.
[87:45.18]Plus five.
[87:46.02]Funny joke beater.
[87:46.88]Funny joke beater.
[87:54.48]Funny joke beater.
[87:55.70]Alert.
[88:05.06]Alright, you're good with your fists.
[88:06.05]Are you insane?
[88:06.55]I'll give you that.
[88:06.95]One more.
[88:07.33]Thanks.
[88:08.41]Yeah, we have another guy with us a while back.
[88:11.05]He was good with his fists, too.
[88:12.65]Came out of nowhere.
[88:13.51]Don't!
[88:15.45]I'm never going to get any points for being a good police officer.
[88:18.55]A lie.
[88:19.21]Turned out it was a good one.
[88:21.61]That guy just drove straight.
[88:24.05]Is anybody even in there?
[88:25.37]Wait a minute.
[88:27.31]You know what they do to traitors, right?
[88:29.60]When Tong is done with them?
[88:31.12]Nobody in that car.
[88:31.90]Alive.
[88:32.20]Alive.
[88:32.44]Alive.
[88:32.82]Alive.
[88:33.32]Yes.
[88:33.98]They are buried alive.
[88:35.44]Mr. Potter.
[88:35.90]No.
[88:36.08]No.
[88:36.30]No.
[88:59.81]We got somebody up here.
[89:00.95]Who's up here?
[89:01.51]Police!
[89:04.03]No, wait.
[89:04.35]I don't have to go that way yet.
[89:12.50]What do you mean?
[89:12.86]What?
[89:13.04]That... Snape, you have never said that?
[89:15.88]Yes, he does.
[89:16.60]In fucking... Let's go.
[89:18.50]The second movie.
[89:19.10]No, no, no.
[89:19.28]You stay here.
[89:20.06]I'll deal with it.
[89:20.94]Watch how a real man does it.
[89:23.76]Son of a bitch.
[89:24.86]Wait!
[89:25.30]You better get down!
[89:26.28]What is he showing me that guy for?
[89:28.06]Chase that guy down?
[89:33.22]Harassed the rival minibus to make him pull over.
[89:35.72]He said it in the Empire Strikes Back.
[89:37.34]Alright, I harassed him long enough.
[90:01.51]Drift more!
[90:02.35]I'm trying!
[90:03.83]So now I have to drop them off somewhere?
[90:12.30]I didn't do it.
[90:13.98]No, I got a bus full of people.
[90:17.88]Okay, be careful there.
[90:19.41]I need to get points.
[90:23.35]What the fuck?
[90:25.14]Escape the ambush?
[90:26.69]Where'd they even ambush?
[90:27.65]They were just sitting in traffic.
[90:29.01]That wasn't an ambush.
[90:30.61]Here we go, that's how you drift.
[90:39.20]Do a little bit of a... Put a good off that jump, would be pretty cool.
[90:46.48]Drifting seems to be pretty important.
[90:54.96]So unnecessary.
[90:58.74]Plus 10 vehicle damaging.
[91:00.52]Kill them?
[91:00.92]Alright, let's kill them.
[91:07.37]There's one.
[91:08.57]Well, that was a lot of collateral damage.
[91:19.52]Innocent hurt.
[91:21.06]This guy?
[91:22.42]That guy's fine.
[91:23.78]How is this guy hurt?
[91:29.69]Come on, pass me.
[91:33.09]Spring-loaded.
[91:34.87]Spring-loaded.
[91:39.16]Passenger satisfaction.
[91:40.30]Whoa!
[91:41.34]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[91:44.40]Don't cross over me like that!
[91:51.50]No.
[91:53.62]God damn it.
[91:54.74]No, I don't understand the rules of the road.
[91:56.78]I'm from America.
[91:59.08]I'm sorry.
[91:59.84]I'm an American.
[92:00.82]Oh, who brought the American?
[92:12.13]All they do is chew loudly and scream loudly.
[92:26.82]Don't blame America for your driving practices.
[92:32.77]Okay, I got some more points.
[92:35.21]Sweet.
[92:37.77]I have a lot of money.
[92:38.41]I think I want to go buy some clothes or something.
[92:43.34]You could be watching Overwatch League right now, but you're watching this instead.
[92:48.84]Let me save you a little bit of time here.
[92:52.79]There's going to be a Winston, a D.Va, an Osiris, and a Amumu.
[93:02.65]And they're going to push mid, and then someone's going to press 4, and the game's going to be over.
[93:10.09]Uncle, trust me now, okay?
[93:11.29]Call the uncle.
[93:12.03]I want to check and see what this is, though.
[93:18.75]Let's get out of here.
[93:27.42]Oh, it's these guys.
[93:32.90]Can I talk to them?
[93:34.48]Talking about me?
[93:38.28]You guys calling me crazy?
[93:41.01]No, they're not.
[93:41.55]They're not speaking of me, are they?
[93:46.05]Why is there an enemy on the map, too?
[93:48.97]I'm confused.
[93:52.34]I'm not gonna punch them.
[93:53.18]They're fellow officers.
[93:54.96]I'm going to punch this person.
[93:56.98]Because we've got a scenario here.
[93:58.87]This guy is in deep shit.
[94:01.83]I can see you from a fucking mile away, dickhead.
[94:04.95]Where are the jewels?
[94:06.77]Where are the jewels?
[94:10.75]Talking now?
[94:16.58]Apparently not.
[94:24.42]Is he gonna jump up here?
[94:27.08]Come up here, come on.
[94:28.16]What?
[94:32.98]How did he do that?
[94:34.12]You gotta be kidding me.
[94:35.28]I just got completely countered.
[94:40.25]Oh, he is like a big fat guy.
[94:41.25]Never mind, that's true.
[94:42.17]You definitely can't grab big fat guys.
[94:43.81]Okay, yep.
[94:48.65]The big dudes you can't grab.
[94:50.25]You have to be more finesse with them.
[94:54.11]I got a new case.
[94:55.05]I'm gonna die.
[94:55.55]Just here, collapsed him.
[95:00.47]Good.
[95:04.58]That's awesome.
[95:05.78]What about you?
[95:09.18]Shit.
[95:09.56]Don't lose.
[95:15.14]Goodbye.
[95:17.04]Nice.
[95:17.28]Do a Power Wrench's Putty Flip.
[95:20.32]Okay.
[95:21.68]So, what did we learn there?
[95:24.40]Not much.
[95:29.64]No.
[95:30.36]I thought I was going to do it, but I'm not going to do it.
[95:33.74]I want to go... Is somebody in this trunk?
[95:37.80]Oh, I thought there was somebody in here already.
[95:39.20]Imagine a tire iron just flew past your field of view.
[95:52.88]What the fuck?
[95:53.36]Can I climb this like a cat?
[95:55.09]No.
[95:58.59]No.
[96:01.89]I'm sorry.
[96:02.93]You know I'm gonna keep doing that.
[96:04.15]What's in there?
[96:04.71]Is he walking around the rake?
[96:07.74]Hey, what's in your wallet, man?
[96:10.76]Yeah, I'll take one.
[96:12.22]What the hell was that?
[96:24.66]Who's crashing?
[96:26.92]Is this a person in the car?
[96:30.72]There's a person in this car right now that's asking me to come talk to him.
[96:34.78]What do you want?
[96:35.26]Oh, it's a higher taxi.
[96:39.41]Okay.
[96:39.69]No, I don't want to do that.
[96:45.79]I want the bike.
[96:57.01]I'm gonna go to the clothing store and see if we can buy something new.
[97:01.43]That was sick.
[97:05.69]Fuck, I was just barely out of the zone.
[97:07.83]Come on.
[97:09.69]Get on the bike again.
[97:10.39]God damn it.
[97:10.71]Go.
[97:10.79]Okay.
[97:10.89]Bike store.
[97:11.27]I mean, clothing store.
[97:12.31]This way.
[97:34.71]I need to do more exploring, too, because there's probably random cases around I can look for.
[97:39.73]I'm taking my time with this one.
[97:41.42]Not just rushing, you know what I'm saying?
[97:45.86]I've done that a lot.
[97:47.64]I promise you, I've done what he just did.
[97:51.08]At least a few times.
[97:52.78]Going upstairs, going downstairs.
[97:54.51]Alright, what about you?
[97:56.57]Nothing?
[97:56.85]Um...
[98:04.42]Can I not?
[98:04.88]Oh, there he is.
[98:06.54]We get funny hats.
[98:08.08]Okay, hats.
[98:09.62]Luchador mask.
[98:10.53]Cowboy hat.
[98:12.07]Pig man.
[98:13.87]Straw hat.
[98:16.17]This thing is so huge.
[98:17.33]I don't want to be the pig.
[98:21.66]I want to be the cowboy.
[98:22.58]I mean, this looks like it could be funny in cutscenes.
[98:37.72]Retro Incheon who is whoa Russian mob 40% melee damage what in the name of God are you talking about?
[99:00.91]Counters are easier to perform.
[99:02.19]This is just like cheating Trunk and fist
[99:08.10]Fill the face meter and you turn to Drunken Fist.
[99:12.42]Unleash GSP's flying punch move and increase grappling damage.
[99:21.21]Sun Wukong.
[99:22.15]League of Legends, I told you.
[99:25.05]Everything can be leaned back to League of Legends.
[99:29.75]Okay.
[99:31.49]I want to be the statue.
[99:33.53]I'm going to have to at some point be the Academy Award.
[99:35.35]You know what I'm saying?
[99:37.17]I have to.
[99:39.03]This is the Academy Award.
[99:43.07]Agent 47.
[99:45.87]I'm not doing that.
[99:46.59]This is a guy from... What's that game?
[99:52.85]A Sneeze in Time.
[99:54.43]That's what it is.
[99:55.83]That's what it was.
[99:56.62]His name's Garrett.
[99:59.60]Guy from Deus Ex Machina.
[100:04.62]Revolver with grenade launcher.
[100:08.00]Lightning Warrior.
[100:08.78]These are all DLC funny costumes, right?
[100:15.26]Now, if I'm going to do one, I'm going to be the Academy Award.
[100:21.55]So, 75,000.
[100:22.55]60% less melee damage taken.
[100:25.41]That's insane.
[100:27.63]Let me just put on this stupid fucking goofy mask.
[100:30.77]From the goofy movie.
[100:32.95]Let's go to the actual clothing store.
[100:37.25]Drunken Fist is probably a lot of fun.
[100:41.61]You can't be the silver surfer if you're not silver.
[100:45.90]He's the gold surfer.
[100:51.86]T-shirt, t-shirt, t-shirt.
[100:53.06]Let's get something interesting.
[100:54.08]These all suck.
[100:57.10]That just looked like a PUBG character.
[101:01.22]And I don't mean that in a good way.
[101:02.36]I mean that in a bad way.
[101:05.70]Uh, net neutrality.
[101:07.26]Oh, we gotta wear the... Come on.
[101:08.18]We gotta wear the net neutrality band.
[101:14.33]Pants.
[101:15.95]These are just... These are all awful.
[101:17.21]Any of the stores?
[101:18.55]There's one down here, too.
[101:27.08]Didn't net neutrality pass, like, for real?
[101:29.80]Actually for real?
[101:30.88]Okay, here we go.
[101:34.17]This is better.
[101:34.71]Torso.
[101:35.53]Undershirt.
[101:36.91]No.
[101:37.23]Pants.
[101:37.77]Do you have any better pants I can buy?
[101:45.47]I have to, like, unlock these, I'm assuming.
[101:48.41]Put the chain on.
[101:52.75]Okay.
[101:53.21]Let's keep going.
[102:00.50]It died.
[102:04.32]Is there a training I can do where I can stop hurting myself trying to jump over shit?
[102:12.86]That's so funny.
[102:13.72]I'm supposed to be some agile man.
[102:21.45]What a troublemaker.
[102:22.77]Yeah, I know.
[102:26.51]You have to let go.
[102:27.31]I'm holding A. You have to just tap it.
[102:28.71]I don't know.
[102:31.22]Let's do a favor.
[102:38.55]What do you need?
[102:39.21]Favor?
[102:40.95]Brand new bed.
[102:43.39]Oh, wait.
[102:43.73]I can buy stuff for the apartment.
[102:45.29]Okay.
[102:45.39]Don't press A. It's funnier.
[102:46.07]Confirm purchase of a new bed for your North Pole apartment.
[102:47.67]Yeah.
[102:47.85]I got plenty of money.
[102:48.55]Spend the money you make.
[102:49.87]Don't sit on your money.
[102:51.13]You know what I'm saying?
[103:07.33]Everyone talks about saving your money.
[103:08.79]Save your money.
[103:09.43]Don't save your money.
[103:10.09]Spend every cent you make from your paycheck.
[103:12.92]Don't put any money in retirement.
[103:14.64]Just go buy beds and bracelets and clothes and shit.
[103:22.48]You should try to not have any money in your checking and savings account at the end of every month.
[103:33.02]By the way, not a financial advisor.
[103:35.52]Not financial advisor.
[103:42.94]Can I climb this?
[103:44.88]Come on.
[103:45.64]There's gotta be, like, secrets I can... I knew it.
[103:48.06]What?
[103:55.72]Can I climb this?
[104:03.45]I feel like I can go this way.
[104:06.86]Looks like there's an entrance I can go over here.
[104:10.46]Or maybe not.
[104:14.00]Looks like it, though.
[104:16.82]Right back here?
[104:17.38]Oooh!
[104:20.02]Case!
[104:25.72]What did I get?
[104:26.30]Just money?
[104:27.06]I just made that $5,000 back immediately.
[104:32.72]Already made it back.
[104:33.34]I don't understand.
[104:36.50]Is this my car or is this her car?
[104:37.88]She's probably going to get repaired.
[104:43.48]Drive Michelle's car into the harbor.
[104:46.46]Oh, this is insurance fraud.
[104:47.76]Okay, so don't take any damage.
[104:49.60]Just get it there.
[104:50.20]Get out of the way.
[104:52.71]Out of the way.
[104:56.59]I've got business to take care of.
[105:02.28]What are those cops doing standing around?
[105:07.18]I have to drive this into the harbor, okay.
[105:08.90]Let's tinker around the side.
[105:13.57]Right off the dock.
[105:23.94]For a second I thought I didn't do that right.
[105:25.48]And I was like, how was I supposed to do that?
[105:27.96]Bye.
[105:30.73]I get it.
[105:31.19]Alright, cool.
[105:34.07]I mean, I could have gone off the edge.
[105:35.81]By the way, I haven't died yet.
[105:37.25]That's a first in video game history for me.
[105:44.33]Get out of there!
[105:45.19]Get out!
[105:45.57]Okay, you don't instantly die when you go into the water.
[105:48.31]Okay, that's good to know.
[105:50.55]What is this guy doing?
[105:51.29]What are you doing?
[105:51.79]I got the SHIT!
[105:55.33]How do I drown?
[106:01.36]Oh.
[106:01.46]Are there animals?
[106:12.55]No.
[106:13.13]They're not going to find me in the water.
[106:14.17]There's no Coast Guard in this game.
[106:18.15]Does China even have a Coast Guard?
[106:21.44]Let's see.
[106:22.02]China didn't even have a Coast Guard.
[106:23.16]I'm fine.
[106:23.86]I just go in the water every time.
[106:31.33]He was fishing?
[106:32.02]No, he wasn't.
[106:33.30]He was dropping off bodies and shit.
[106:35.24]I took care of him.
[106:42.14]I do love the fact that... Wowee, I can do that.
[106:45.10]See what I just did?
[106:47.57]I was doing another mission.
[106:48.19]I think I have to go back and collect from her.
[106:50.63]This is going to be fun.
[106:54.59]This is going to be fun.
[106:56.63]That wasn't that fun, actually.
[106:58.03]Case.
[106:58.37]Case.
[107:03.54]Just get out of the way I'm trying to do something Get out of my way What am I doing with you?
[107:16.84]What am I doing with you?
[107:18.40]Just go into like the barbershop singers over here
[107:31.25]Every time.
[107:31.97]I'll block you every time, dickhead.
[107:33.75]Yeah, what am I doing with you?
[107:38.79]What am I doing with you?
[107:40.31]What am I doing with you?
[107:53.66]Somehow that was an inconvenience.
[107:54.94]Get out of here.
[108:03.60]This is fun.
[108:04.30]I love this game.
[108:07.68]It's fun just to run around and throw things.
[108:12.24]Ten thousand dollars.
[108:15.27]It's becoming painfully obvious that that's such an extreme amount of money that's lying around in the world.
[108:21.29]You have to get them.
[108:24.23]Just take a joyride and look around.
[108:28.38]One thing I don't understand yet is what are these little white tablets?
[108:34.40]I guess I'm about to find out.
[108:35.38]This is just a dragon kick.
[108:37.16]Okay, yeah.
[108:38.60]This is where you get your millennial energy drinks.
[108:44.66]Or your Coke Zeros, whatever the hell these are.
[108:50.98]You shouldn't have sold that to me!
[108:52.06]I got so much caffeine running the taurine!
[108:56.26]You know they have balls pee in their sodas?
[109:01.58]Okay, let's go.
[109:09.02]You know how true that is?
[109:09.76]That is actually true.
[109:10.46]If you guys didn't know.
[109:12.60]All those sugary energy drinks that you're drinking have taurine, which is bull piss.
[109:21.89]The local street racing problem is getting out of hand.
[109:23.99]Intercept and take out their vehicles.
[109:26.05]Okay.
[109:31.96]Get to the race.
[109:33.00]This is... I like this car.
[109:37.65]This car is awesome.
[109:38.81]Where do I get one of these?
[109:47.43]Where do I get one of these bad guys?
[109:52.29]Whoa.
[109:57.77]Going a little too fast.
[109:58.63]It's alright, though.
[110:03.56]You fucking did it to me.
[110:05.22]He did that to me.
[110:07.70]I gotta get to the front.
[110:15.20]There's one.
[110:15.60]No.
[110:15.76]They're all still behind me.
[110:28.01]How are you still able to drive that car?
[110:30.15]I don't know.
[110:43.68]Come here!
[110:47.14]This car is not disabled?!
[110:50.74]Your car is still alive!
[110:58.71]Cars are still working perfectly fine.
[111:01.27]At this point I think I would stop the race.
[111:06.31]You're going to keep racing.
[111:07.35]Okay.
[111:09.71]Oh my god.
[111:10.23]I don't think I'm going to do this.
[111:13.96]Well, they all went the other way.
[111:23.46]I'm fairly certain I'm not... I went the wrong way.
[111:27.29]Yeah, I went the wrong way.
[111:28.21]Okay.
[111:28.97]Okay.
[111:37.16]I wasn't gonna be able to do it anyways.
[111:40.14]Maybe I will.
[111:40.90]Hold on.
[111:41.84]Hold that thought.
[111:46.37]Why is it so difficult to do this?
[111:57.01]This guy doesn't even have a marker anymore.
[111:59.75]I gotta get the guy up front.
[112:01.73]I gotta get all the way up front.
[112:03.00]Focus and get the guy in the front, because I'm almost there.
[112:10.51]That was 90%!
[112:11.57]Restart from the checkpoint.
[112:14.09]That was 90%, not 100%.
[112:14.85]Do it again.
[112:15.25]I got it.
[112:16.95]Let's do it again.
[112:18.77]Alright.
[112:34.07]One at a time.
[112:34.67]Here we go.
[112:39.20]Smash.
[112:40.22]Gotta get right on next to him.
[112:47.22]That didn't do it.
[112:48.28]I'm gonna wait for this guy.
[112:49.26]No?
[112:49.76]Why not?
[112:55.12]You gotta get him right in the cheek.
[112:59.00]Oh, if you didn't suck so bad, you'd be right here already.
[113:06.20]This dude's indestructible.
[113:13.22]God damn it.
[113:19.08]It seems to take a lot to do this.
[113:21.30]I'm trying.
[113:23.00]I'm focusing on trying to get this one fucking guy.
[113:25.10]I've hit like four times.
[113:34.17]Jesus Christ.
[113:35.17]Alright, now the other guys.
[113:48.19]It can't take me 60% to do it for one person.
[113:52.85]There's two.
[113:53.47]Alright.
[113:54.19]Get this other guy in the front.
[114:00.29]That's it.
[114:00.73]Alright, now wait for this fucking idiot to come around.
[114:03.13]Get away from me.
[114:05.01]You're gonna ruin everything.
[114:05.83]Don't ruin everything.
[114:06.51]He's gonna blow up.
[114:07.23]Oh my god.
[114:07.97]God.
[114:11.82]Get out of the way.
[114:21.81]That's it.
[114:22.59]Game over.
[114:25.57]Finally.
[114:25.87]Okay.
[114:28.73]Good cop points.
[114:29.87]Thank you.
[114:32.27]Uh, thank you.
[114:35.17]Almost to level one.
[114:40.27]Paul from Tran.
[114:40.79]Hello.
[114:41.13]How are you?
[114:41.71]I did it.
[114:42.69]Shoved all those guys off the road.
[114:48.43]Okay, cool.
[114:48.97]So I'm gonna have to do those more than once.
[114:58.75]Purchase gray market vehicles if your face is high enough.
[115:01.03]Cool.
[115:01.15]Let's do a favor.
[115:08.18]What do you got?
[115:10.24]You need a car?
[115:13.42]I can hook you up with a car.
[115:16.12]Why would you do that?
[115:17.00]What did you do that for?
[115:21.08]Why would you do that?
[115:23.11]Get in the car.
[115:24.55]Get in!
[115:26.25]Calvin, get in the car.
[115:30.18]Get in the car, Calvin.
[115:32.94]Calvin, time is of the essence.
[115:36.40]Okay.
[115:43.26]Getaway is going to be... I've got an idea.
[115:46.22]Take him to the edge of the Earth.
[115:47.96]What is that thing over there?
[115:48.94]There's like a lantern blinking.
[115:51.18]Alright, I know how to lose these guys.
[115:52.32]I'm going to get to the edge of the world here.
[115:53.96]Get to the edge of the world.
[115:55.42]Take him to the coast and ditch him into the water.
[115:57.28]Can I go that way?
[116:11.75]I wonder if I can run around like the circle like this and just play hide-and-go-seek Okay, this is perfect Let's get him over to the dock
[116:46.16]Alright, so now if they come down here, they're gonna go up the edge.
[116:51.84]That's the theory, at least.
[117:01.74]Whoa!
[117:02.36]He's shooting a gun.
[117:07.54]Oh shit.
[117:08.97]Oh shit.
[117:09.79]Oh shit.
[117:10.67]Oh shit.
[117:13.43]I can't move.
[117:14.98]What am I crawling out of the top?
[117:18.66]Come here, come here!
[117:21.08]Tackle 2!
[117:21.50]Did I just get arrested?
[117:29.81]Alright, don't blame me for that.
[117:36.23]Blame him for not getting in the car right away.
[117:41.33]See?
[117:42.33]I would have been already out of here.
[117:45.93]I would have already been out of here.
[117:47.41]You see this shit?
[117:48.22]He took like 12 seconds to get in the car.
[117:51.74]Did I just get arrested?
[117:52.52]Are you serious?
[117:53.42]What?
[117:54.02]What?
[117:54.20]What?
[118:12.21]Come on, get out of the way.
[118:15.91]There's one.
[118:17.03]There's two.
[118:18.74]Not quite.
[118:19.68]Almost, though.
[118:21.20]Come on.
[118:23.48]Get out of here.
[118:26.62]Finally.
[118:34.15]Finally.
[118:35.95]Right.
[118:36.49]What a getaway.
[118:37.83]Thanks, Wade.
[118:38.77]Next time I need to hit a cop, I know who to call.
[118:43.70]Pull over and drop off Calvin.
[118:47.38]Almost level two.
[118:48.64]Or halfway, at least.
[118:58.77]Wait, what if I do this thing and stop and he hits it?
[119:00.63]You know, can he hit it with his head?
[119:01.81]Like, if he runs and I stop and pull over and he'll, you know... I'm doing a terrible job explaining this.
[119:09.34]If I drive ahead of him, and then open it, will he run into it?
[119:14.20]Like in those funny comedy movies.
[119:17.96]I want to look at this.
[119:18.69]What are these hands?
[119:19.95]What's this iPhone emoji over here?
[119:24.03]The two hands.
[119:24.63]Dojo or something?
[119:29.04]Learning new moves, maybe?
[119:30.36]I don't know.
[119:30.70]Let's find out.
[119:34.04]This is Massage.
[119:36.34]Sharpened senses makes your face meter fill a bit faster.
[119:39.43]That's a lot of money, but I kind of want it.
[119:43.71]There's also an envelope behind her.
[119:47.67]This girl's not going to get naked, is she?
[119:51.00]No, no, no.
[119:55.12]This is not... This is a Massage.
[119:58.74]That was wonderful.
[120:00.00]I hope you plan to be a regular customer, Wei.
[120:03.72]Sure.
[120:04.22]$50,000 by... Wowee.
[120:06.72]Are you kidding me?
[120:08.96]Don't even do the missions in the game.
[120:10.14]Just run around and collect money.
[120:15.48]Keep your eyes peeled.
[120:21.22]We're going on a briefcase hunt.
[120:22.94]There's got to be one back here somewhere.
[120:27.74]I would assume, right?
[120:30.82]No.
[120:32.06]Oh, wowee.
[120:37.84]It's down here.
[120:38.32]There's another massage place.
[120:39.76]So, what do the cops do?
[120:43.39]Is this just kind of like in GTA where if you see the blue, it's just, hey, okay, don't do anything crazy.
[120:48.41]There's a police officer right here.
[120:50.49]I'm assuming that's what that means because I can't interact with them or anything.
[120:55.87]Any more money envelopes behind the massage parlor?
[121:00.09]No.
[121:01.51]Let's do one more favor and then I'm gonna go to the case file.
[121:04.11]Curious about it.
[121:05.97]Hydrate or die.
[121:06.77]Well, that was a Spider-Man move that I loved.
[121:18.05]Go up top.
[121:21.29]I forgot I even had a gun in this game.
[121:24.08]I don't know how to get to it.
[121:24.98]How do you cycle to the gun?
[121:30.52]I don't think I can.
[121:31.26]What do you need?
[121:32.42]Um.
[121:32.50]How do I say?
[121:33.94]What?
[121:55.70]Somebody did the same thing I did.
[121:59.08]See, it was nerves, because somebody else did it too, okay?
[122:04.56]Don't lose your target.
[122:09.83]Wait, what?
[122:10.89]Where did he go?
[122:26.74]The marker said it was up the stairs.
[122:33.02]So he was down.
[122:34.34]No, he wasn't down.
[122:35.00]He was over here.
[122:35.56]He went around.
[122:40.39]Case back there.
[122:41.55]Don't let me forget that.
[122:44.85]He wasn't down.
[122:45.49]He was over here.
[122:52.09]Come on.
[122:58.11]He's waiting for me.
[122:58.81]Come here, you little fuck.
[123:07.68]Oh, that was a sick WWF turnbuckle move.
[123:09.60]I loved it.
[123:15.94]Whoops-a-daisy.
[123:16.46]Don't know what the fuck that was, but it's okay.
[123:17.88]I'll take it.
[123:21.99]You too!
[123:23.23]Oh, you fell.
[123:27.31]I really am just a wrestler.
[123:28.35]I'm doing spears.
[123:29.17]I'm doing turnbuckle smashes.
[123:30.51]See you later.
[123:44.23]It's been fun.
[123:45.82]I'll take my $20.
[123:46.34]I want to get the briefcase, though.
[123:52.90]Briefcase was back here.
[123:55.89]Uh, not over here.
[123:56.37]It was a little bit further back.
[123:57.73]Just gonna retrace my steps.
[124:03.94]Uh, not here.
[124:04.76]There.
[124:07.38]No.
[124:09.38]Further back we go.
[124:11.14]Where's the briefcase?
[124:13.88]Where the fuck is it?
[124:16.38]There it is.
[124:21.59]10,000.
[124:23.35]I really do gotta spend some money.
[124:25.75]Alright, case file time.
[124:26.91]Let's actually do a mission, instead of just dicking around.
[124:33.11]Costume?
[124:33.93]Costume.
[124:41.37]That's a long fall.
[124:44.29]Oh, that's right, I can be the statue.
[124:48.15]I feel like that's just going too fast.
[124:51.00]You know what I mean?
[124:53.00]That joke has to be a few hours into the stream.
[124:55.10]You know what I mean?
[124:55.52]Otherwise, we're just going to blow the whole thing.
[124:59.50]60% less damage?
[125:00.30]I feel like that's just ruining the game.
[125:11.01]Anybody else agree with that?
[125:14.03]Taxis fast travel?
[125:15.15]Okay, cool.
[125:17.37]Good to know.
[125:20.97]Back tape!
[125:27.06]Let's go over here.
[125:29.60]How much does this cost?
[125:32.88]Do it or riot.
[125:33.74]I'm gonna do it.
[125:34.70]I just don't want to do it right now.
[125:40.81]$300.
[125:42.65]Did I drive to a different state?
[125:46.56]I was looking at this.
[125:47.10]We use health shrine.
[125:50.63]Four for next health upgrade.
[125:51.91]Okay, you smoke the... Alright, so I need to do those to get max health upgrades, I guess.
[126:00.85]Interesting.
[126:07.84]Drunken style.
[126:08.48]We'll get them.
[126:10.09]Let me just play the regular video game for a little while.
[126:12.29]What are you doing here?
[126:13.49]I'm sure you and Pendrew have a lot of top-secret backdoor business to attend to.
[126:18.01]Look, I'm sorry about how I acted.
[126:20.25]Just playing the part.
[126:22.35]I'm already out there on the streets.
[126:23.62]I hear things like this ketamine racket.
[126:26.30]I'll see what I can dig up.
[126:27.76]Yeah, and it's going to be funny when I'm the Oscar and I'm talking in cutscenes.
[126:31.10]Look, I'll help where I can.
[126:34.14]What?
[126:34.74]I'm just a little shocked.
[126:36.40]I'm just used to Pendrew's people being more like him.
[126:39.03]This is Frank West, whatever his name is.
[126:46.36]The camera guy from the Capcom zombie throw things everything, grab everything and throw everything game.
[126:51.46]Let's get a text here.
[126:56.36]Winston wants me to check up on you.
[126:57.62]Everything cool.
[127:04.40]Meet me at the market and noodle shop.
[127:06.32]Sure.
[127:08.89]What the fuck are these guys talking about?
[127:22.45]So elaborate.
[127:23.03]Is this car... Got a guy peeing over here.
[127:34.76]Yeah, that's a fucking sex offense, buddy.
[127:39.78]I'm gonna pee on the wall.
[127:44.26]That is a crime.
[127:45.06]What is this, reading?
[127:46.76]Is this reading?
[127:47.56]What are you reading?
[127:49.81]Is that banned?
[127:51.41]What material is that?
[127:52.35]Let's see.
[127:54.65]Taxi... Taxi cab... Was... Un...
[128:03.93]Carbo.
[128:04.41]I don't know what that means.
[128:06.25]What does this one say?
[128:08.21]Job hunt.
[128:09.53]Contradicted.
[128:11.57]Make your wager.
[128:13.11]Make your way to work.
[128:15.01]You know, just insert funny fucking text joke here.
[128:18.82]Okay.
[128:34.85]I was trying to heal the cab, and it didn't work.
[128:37.55]What do we got?
[128:41.75]Uh, need a thing.
[128:43.81]Actually, I really needed that cab to let me go.
[128:45.31]I need another cab.
[128:49.78]I don't want to drive my own way.
[128:51.36]The fuck are you doing?
[128:55.82]You don't see a guy in the middle of the road, stupid?
[128:57.70]I'm gonna need a new fender after this one.
[129:07.71]Doesn't seem to care.
[129:09.47]For some reason.
[129:10.19]Don't know why.
[129:13.95]Can I go in the back?
[129:18.49]What else is going on?
[129:21.88]Is somebody else crashing because of this?
[129:24.22]Hey, look.
[129:25.20]Exactly what I was looking for.
[129:26.10]Let's go.
[129:32.74]Case?
[129:33.24]What the?
[129:34.40]Where was the case?
[129:36.94]Shit.
[129:38.66]I don't remember where I even was.
[129:40.40]God damn it.
[129:41.26]I'm so angry.
[129:45.27]It's alright.
[129:45.87]Whatever.
[129:46.17]Relax.
[129:57.00]I'm gonna go around here.
[130:07.75]Okay, that's not what I was going to do, but that's fine.
[130:12.62]What are you throwing out the window here?
[130:19.28]Oh shit, that lady had a baby.
[130:24.26]Oh no, oh no, no.
[130:25.83]How do I get in there?
[130:29.43]Oh no!
[130:33.25]I'm going to report an incident here.
[130:36.54]What was that for?
[130:37.12]She was illegally dumping!
[130:43.27]Why is this in the game?
[130:44.17]You can take Spider-Man up buildings.
[130:50.99]Alright, let's just go with it.
[131:05.31]Yeah, there was an illegal dumpage.
[131:07.23]And the woman fell backwards.
[131:08.21]She was dumping water out.
[131:09.07]She dropped water in the ground.
[131:10.31]That's not... I didn't do anything.
[131:17.38]Ah, there he is.
[131:17.80]How's your connect?
[131:27.77]Getting everything you need?
[131:29.03]No, man.
[131:30.53]I haven't been back to Popstar since I left Dog Eyes.
[131:32.95]Yeah.
[131:33.77]I'm not sure how he's going to take it.
[131:35.27]Want me to talk to him?
[131:36.27]Yeah.
[131:37.31]Yeah.
[131:37.41]I'm just about out.
[131:38.71]So grab my next shipment and make sure everything is cool.
[131:42.61]You got to go to Popstar's courtside hangout.
[131:51.48]Trying to just get through.
[131:53.38]There we are.
[131:54.76]There we are.
[131:55.56]Make sure everything's cool.
[131:56.82]Wait.
[132:00.07]Is this where the baby is?
[132:02.01]No.
[132:06.27]Sorry, I can still hear the baby crying.
[132:09.40]Is this some deep punishment for me for the rest of the game?
[132:12.30]I have to hear the baby cry?
[132:21.14]See, if I was watching on the side of the road right now, I would think this was some shitty YouTuber doing like a challenge.
[132:28.04]Okay, guys, I'm going to run across down the street in L.A.
[132:31.14]I'm going to go over every car.
[132:32.38]I'm going to try to go for the Guinness record of how many cars I can go over.
[132:36.81]It's a social experiment, bro.
[132:44.69]Yeah, that has actually happened to me.
[132:47.93]Those of you that are paying attention.
[132:49.37]Hey, is Popstar around?
[132:50.98]Won't be a nice looking boy like you once was my boy.
[132:55.70]Get the luchador mask on.
[132:56.96]We're going so hard right now.
[132:59.22]We're going so hard right now.
[133:01.22]Make sure you put a sound effect every four seconds.
[133:04.21]Like...
[133:16.96]and have the camera shake the fuck everywhere and make sure, number one thing, anytime somebody might say a joke, anytime somebody says a joke, doesn't matter if it's a remotely funny one, if it's a reference, doesn't matter.
[133:32.15]Close up, cut to their face.
[133:34.59]Doesn't fucking matter.
[133:35.75]I'm gonna give you an example.
[133:36.77]Let's just let, stream's gonna take a backseat for a second here while I show you this.
[133:40.61]No, it's not, nevermind.
[133:41.59]No, fuck, I have to show you this.
[133:45.67]Nevermind, I can't do it.
[133:55.86]We're fine.
[133:56.24]It's right here.
[133:58.81]Fine.
[133:59.05]The deadbeats.
[133:59.49]Alright.
[133:59.71]But you know what I'm saying?
[134:01.19]Somebody says something that could be determined to be sort of a quip or a comment or something funny, potentially.
[134:10.02]And they do this thing where they go into Premiere or Final Cut, whatever program you're using.
[134:14.60]And it's not a camera zoom in.
[134:16.70]They do a jump, like they cut... All they do is they drag the video file and scale it.
[134:23.18]And do a scale zoom quickly for a half second into the person's face while they say the one line that they're going to say.
[134:29.45]That happens like 75 times in every one of these videos.
[134:32.99]Oh my god.
[134:39.05]Yeah, see?
[134:40.53]Well one has it.
[134:44.89]What am I doing?
[134:47.73]Where am I going?
[134:48.19]I'm just talking and walking in circles.
[134:49.65]Here are the deadbeats.
[134:52.46]Let's fuck up this whole grocery store.
[134:59.06]Who else?
[134:59.26]Come on.
[135:00.92]PopStyle wants his money.
[135:02.68]Speaking of Pop.
[135:04.41]You look a little thirsty.
[135:07.63]What about you?
[135:08.13]Wow.
[135:08.93]What about you?
[135:13.61]My stomach.
[135:16.70]Where'd he go?
[135:25.42]He is there, you think you're gonna get away?
[135:26.97]No, you're not.
[135:28.51]Watch me Batman this fucking guy.
[135:35.39]Why are you running?
[135:37.99]You had nothing to do with it, man.
[135:43.62]No, door slam!
[135:44.34]I wanna try the door slam.
[135:49.19]What is this guy's problem?
[135:50.61]What is your problem, man?
[135:51.77]I get the problem.
[135:58.38]That guy was just in a suit.
[135:59.56]I thought that guy was just angry at what happened.
[136:02.12]Hey, what's up, man?
[136:03.28]Oh, just move!
[136:04.56]He's okay.
[136:05.66]One of Winston's guys.
[136:06.74]Yeah?
[136:07.42]Yes, son of me will take on anyone these days.
[136:12.19]Purchased drugs.
[136:13.21]Who's that?
[136:13.81]Tang Shen.
[136:14.83]Best shit in Hong Kong.
[136:16.55]You got my money?
[136:17.59]Got your money.
[136:18.33]Here's your package.
[136:19.73]That guy was the... Was that the taxi cab driver?
[136:21.85]It's the cops.
[136:24.29]Stay cool.
[136:25.11]Hey, you two!
[136:25.86]Come over here!
[136:26.70]Let's go!
[136:27.46]Oh, shit.
[136:27.84]Hold on, guys.
[136:28.62]I can handle this.
[136:30.30]I'm gonna just bend over and show him my asshole.
[136:34.70]Alright, uh...
[136:45.25]I didn't do that either.
[136:46.15]Let's just get in here.
[136:51.21]I've got like a heat level of 1, don't I?
[136:53.17]Okay.
[136:54.03]That makes sense.
[137:02.51]Taxi drivers wear suits in Hong Kong?
[137:04.31]Do they really?
[137:06.39]Interesting.
[137:06.69]I didn't know that.
[137:12.20]Now, don't go into the police station.
[137:13.92]What are you, stupid?
[137:14.98]I have an idea.
[137:16.54]I'll hide in the police station.
[137:24.12]That person just drove their car over a geyser and shot them up into the Grand Canyon.
[137:28.52]We're good.
[137:38.70]Hey, let's give him a call.
[137:47.28]Hey.
[137:51.35]Oh, wait.
[137:52.23]Oh, okay.
[137:52.81]Wait, did I just... I think I just... Hey, slow down.
[137:56.57]That would've been really funny if I just got hit by a car.
[137:58.36]I wish I could press the button and go, POLICE!
[138:19.92]I will never have enough points to do anything with the police side of things.
[138:23.62]What are you... Get away from me!
[138:25.10]You know I'm talking about the police button where you go, POLICE!
[138:35.91]MOVE MOTHERFUCKER, POLICE!
[138:37.79]I don't have that.
[138:38.49]That means I can't get away with everything.
[138:47.56]Jump on a truck?
[138:48.30]There's plenty of time for that.
[138:50.48]That was cool.
[138:54.89]Would have been cooler if I had actually made it.
[138:56.73]Now can I bring the... I don't want to lose the... Can I bring the motorcycle up here?
[139:05.07]I definitely can.
[139:05.75]Alright, bring it in here.
[139:22.35]There's the baby again.
[139:27.19]Don't dump shit on me.
[139:31.75]That person went under the table.
[139:53.46]I'm not sure if that guy died or if he was playing Twister.
[139:58.07]That guy's so fucked up.
[140:04.63]That guy became a modern art piece.
[140:09.07]Alright, I gotta upgrade.
[140:12.91]Cop upgrades.
[140:14.77]Slim Jim to quickly break into cars without setting off the alarm or breaking the window.
[140:17.93]Alright.
[140:19.57]Wake and disarm gun-wielding enemies without a struggle.
[140:23.32]Um, what's the next one?
[140:25.40]Slow motion follow-up.
[140:27.66]Action dismount.
[140:28.44]Wake and enter slow motion aiming while leaping from a vehicle at high speed while armed.
[140:34.49]Let's go.
[140:35.09]That's cooler than this.
[140:36.03]This is just like, you can disarm somebody, and then now you can do a slow motion.
[140:39.67]And then now you have a better recoil.
[140:42.75]Nah, fuck that, man.
[140:43.65]We're doing this.
[140:46.03]Police trunk.
[140:47.87]Yeah, forget that.

[142:06.21]Ah, pretty tight, huh?
[142:11.07]Just wanted to show it to you.
[142:12.17]Maybe you thought it was cool.
[142:20.42]What a clumsy fucker.
[142:23.48]Alright, let's go.
[142:25.74]Take down the supplier.
[142:34.53]I'm not going to be able to drive on the wrong side of the road.
[142:42.21]No, I thought it said innocent killed.
[142:43.85]I was like, how is that possible?
[142:45.80]Everyone's alive.
[142:51.12]Shut up.
[142:55.72]Thugs remaining.
[142:56.30]Eliminate all of the thugs in the hangout.
[142:58.64]Hack the security camera, but you'll have to get rid of the thugs first.
[143:04.41]Easy enough.
[143:12.09]I have a solution.
[143:26.50]Who needs a melee?
[143:28.58]You've got car melee.
[143:31.10]Only one guy left.
[143:38.72]Whoa!
[143:41.81]Wait, hold on.
[143:42.75]They stole... They're stream sniping me.
[143:44.17]They took my technique.
[143:46.03]They stole my own fucking technique.
[143:48.77]Unbelievable.
[143:54.04]Get in the car.
[144:04.22]Okay, hack the camera.
[144:11.95]And I use the surveillance system.
[144:18.01]What is the- what's the code?
[144:19.03]I don't know what the code is.
[144:20.85]Enter four unique digits.
[144:22.01]Did I get a code?
[144:23.34]I didn't pay attention to the code.
[144:27.16]What was the code?
[144:28.54]Oh shit.
[144:37.11]No duplicates allowed?
[144:38.23]Oh, okay.
[144:40.77]I got four correct.
[145:10.67]Invalid placement, so there's a 3 somewhere.
[145:13.19]It's one of these.
[145:15.35]Password has been reset.
[145:20.96]Alright, we're gonna go with 1, 3, 4, and 6.
[145:27.64]They're all incorrect.
[145:28.62]Okay, what about 0, 2, 7, 9?
[145:29.40]Okay, 2 and 9.
[145:38.57]I'm going to say, okay, so let's go two, nine, uh, eight, five.
[145:49.45]Okay.
[145:50.05]Alright.
[145:50.45]I got the code.
[145:51.29]Two, nine, eight, five.
[145:54.34]It's not here.
[145:55.22]So two is not here.
[145:56.58]Two is not here.
[145:59.20]Two is here.
[146:00.80]Two.
[146:03.25]Uh, nine is probably here.
[146:06.97]2985.
[146:07.09]Nine.
[146:08.33]Eight.
[146:08.67]Five.
[146:09.91]Got the eight in the right place.
[146:11.51]Switch to the two and the five.
[146:17.75]Okay, got the two.
[146:18.47]Now... Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, we've cracked the code.
[146:21.13]Five and nine.
[146:25.01]Thank you.
[146:28.02]Now what?
[146:30.08]Uh, use the surveillance feed in your apartment to bust the supplier.
[146:36.33]You got it.
[146:38.29]Give me that tire iron first.
[146:40.82]You know, that's a hard word to say.
[146:42.24]Anyone else think about that too?
[146:44.58]Tire iron.
[146:45.82]Tire iron.
[146:48.04]Tire iron.
[146:50.26]Too many I-R-E's.
[146:51.44]Too many I-R's.
[146:53.87]I usually just make it one word, like tire iron.
[146:57.37]Sorry, I saw one of these things.
[147:01.25]Tire iron.
[147:09.67]What am I holding?
[147:10.57]Hold for what?
[147:12.83]What do I get for this?
[147:13.73]Oh, that's how you put it away.
[147:14.49]That's how you just put it down.
[147:15.77]Okay.
[147:19.99]Tire iron.
[147:27.18]Tire iron.
[147:29.30]Say it right.
[147:32.76]I threw that into her body.
[147:35.02]Police!
[147:38.94]I'm not a maniac.
[147:40.36]Say it out loud.
[147:41.48]Three times.
[147:43.28]Tire iron.
[147:44.66]Tire iron.
[147:46.20]Tire iron.
[147:49.63]Why would you jump off it then?
[147:50.61]I'm looking at it.
[147:57.15]Get on the bike.
[148:01.13]I'm not making a joke.
[148:01.89]I'm just saying.
[148:02.65]That word is a weird placement of letters.
[148:12.75]I'm glad you really can't fall off the bike.
[148:15.13]It's kind of hard to do.
[148:16.81]Alright.
[148:24.75]User surveillance.
[148:25.51]Can I bring the bike in my house?
[148:39.46]Can I open this door?
[148:40.72]Please tell me the door can open.
[148:44.73]Open the door.
[148:46.59]Damn it.
[148:47.02]I can't go in there and just peel out all over this guy.
[148:49.04]What a joke.
[148:51.88]Are we going to anybody else's house?
[149:03.37]No, I can't.
[149:04.25]Fuck it.
[149:04.71]Let's just go.
[149:07.43]Wait, I can.
[149:08.01]I can bring it in here.
[149:08.69]I can bring this in my bed.
[149:10.31]Speaking of beds.
[149:12.53]That's my new bed.
[149:14.98]This place is a fucking dump.
[149:16.06]Alright, general triad activity.
[149:20.98]Kennedy Town.
[149:21.64]North Point.
[149:24.05]We've got triad activity here at Lock Fu Park.
[149:27.53]Looks like there was a struggle here.
[149:29.61]Let's go over the surveillance video.
[149:32.69]Identify the supplier and have him arrested.
[149:34.27]I think it's the guy in the middle right here.
[149:47.55]God, that guy's got a knife.
[149:55.47]That's it, right?
[149:57.21]Might be that guy.
[149:57.76]Might need to take a picture here.
[150:06.22]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[150:07.26]Why is it pointing at him?
[150:13.09]Am I getting Luigi'd here?
[150:17.31]What do you drop congratulations you win, okay
[150:39.45]Inspector Tang, this is Wei.
[150:41.63]Fangshan is down.
[150:42.70]Popstar will have to reach out to another supplier.
[150:44.78]I'm thinking we bag them both at once.
[150:46.92]I agree.
[150:47.88]I'm gonna get close to him.
[150:49.58]I'm gonna need a good disguise.
[150:51.14]Can you have your people send something over?
[150:52.62]Ooh, I get a disguise.
[150:53.82]Keep me informed.
[150:54.82]Got it.
[150:55.53]How would you even have that?
[150:56.87]I never understood the point of these things.
[151:00.03]These old school air conditioners where you put the tassels on them.
[151:04.61]Why?
[151:05.93]To prove that air is coming out?
[151:09.67]This is annoying.
[151:11.61]You can't hold your hand up and see if there's air coming out.
[151:14.04]You need annoying, like... Just put your hand up.
[151:23.52]It's air.
[151:24.02]You can feel it.
[151:26.92]You don't know, you can't tell if it's on?
[151:29.11]They make a shitload of noise.
[151:30.35]Have you ever heard what an air conditioner sounds like when it's turned on?
[151:38.58]That's what they... I wonder if it's on.
[151:43.84]Listen.
[151:44.12]The bike is exactly where I left it.
[151:54.45]You're a fucking maniac.
[152:05.78]This sounds like a horror movie soundtrack.
[152:11.14]Even with me slashing into shit.
[152:16.72]And they're going to find out that their vacation is not what they thought it was.
[152:24.17]Vacation in the woods.
[152:26.29]Rated T. Bike on bed or worse joke, you got it.
[152:45.54]Turn him into art again.
[152:46.50]Shit, I can't.
[152:48.74]Bike on bed or pre-recorded.
[152:50.17]I have to do it.
[152:54.09]Come on, guys.
[152:55.09]Bike on bed or pre-recorded, right?
[153:05.31]Peggy 13.
[153:07.11]What am I doing?
[153:07.93]Turn around, you stupid asshole.
[153:16.38]Okay, go this way.
[153:30.52]Stop being a pervert!
[153:33.20]You know the punishment for being a pervert in this fucking town.
[153:36.88]It's a fucking head peel-out.
[153:50.14]Uh, excuse me, do you speak English?
[153:52.66]I like to think so.
[153:53.96]Not enough to get by anyways.
[153:55.77]You?
[153:56.13]People are all freaking out.
[153:57.59]Wait, what do you mean?
[153:58.77]Oh, yeah, yeah, I speak English.
[154:02.77]I kind of guessed.
[154:03.87]What can I do for you?
[154:04.74]I'm looking for this place.
[154:07.54]My character sounds like Michael Keaton.
[154:09.00]Doesn't he?
[154:09.40]Like, just imagine this is Birdman.
[154:11.02]What?
[154:11.16]You just gave me two different names.
[154:36.62]Hi, I'm Jeremy, by the way.
[154:37.80]Oh, you can call me Mark, too.
[154:38.94]I mean, you know, whatever you feel like.
[154:43.64]Don't I just have... Give me that.
[155:00.37]Get the bike.
[155:06.53]That's the one.
[155:07.15]I need a new one.
[155:08.31]I gotta show her how cool I am.
[155:11.53]You know what I mean?
[155:13.48]I gotta prove to her that the stream's not pre-recorded.
[155:16.72]Come on up here.
[155:17.30]She's too heavy.
[155:18.02]She's too heavy.
[155:18.42]I can't.
[155:18.68]She weighs too much.
[155:37.07]ways too much.
[155:38.12]How?
[155:40.08]I wouldn't say that.
[155:40.91]I got a few.
[155:43.75]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[155:45.37]Maybe once that's dealt with, I'll get out to figuring out life.
[155:49.01]Oh, yeah?
[155:50.23]Alright, come on in.
[155:51.19]Well, the trick to Hong Kong is learning to live by ancient Chinese wisdom.
[155:54.71]I can't get out.
[155:55.89]God damn it, I can't prove it.
[155:57.23]Always buckle your seatbelt and only apply makeup at red lights.
[156:00.83]Don't text and drive, you know, that kind of thing.
[156:03.40]Words to live by.
[156:06.24]Wait, you're scaring me!
[156:14.18]Yeah, we just killed a person.
[156:15.30]It's not a big deal.
[156:15.94]Welcome to Hong Kong.
[156:21.92]Uh-oh, you don't like it?
[156:25.64]Fucking American.
[156:26.40]This is how we do things in Hong Kong.
[156:36.27]That was helpful.
[156:36.75]Never mind.
[156:44.10]I don't think I can fall off this, by the way.
[156:51.42]No, we can't.
[156:52.80]Drive to the club, bam bam.
[156:54.72]What?
[156:54.94]Didn't we just do that?
[156:55.68]I don't understand.
[156:58.50]Why are you making me drive back and forth?
[157:00.80]Stop playing frisbee with me.
[157:04.68]Well, I am trying to kill us.
[157:07.78]That's what you don't understand.
[157:18.49]The Bam Bam?
[157:21.55]I'm showing her around town, I get it.
[157:27.23]Check it out up here.
[157:31.33]Interesting, funny history here about Hong Kong.
[157:35.09]This bridge was actually crafted back in 1501.
[157:38.55]And the bridge was a gift, actually, to the Ming Dynasty.
[157:42.90]And they were actually, they were motorcycle salesmen back then.
[157:45.86]So, actually, this bike has been handed down for about 6,000 years now.
[157:59.30]And, well, like, hold on to your cameras here.
[158:01.63]Because you're going to get quite a view of Hong Kong up here.
[158:06.05]I promise you that.
[158:07.95]What kind of camera is that, by the way?
[158:09.15]Nice camera.
[158:10.18]Digital?
[158:11.14]Yeah.
[158:12.21]Very nice.
[158:12.65]So if you take a look here on your right, you will see the Great Wall of China.
[158:17.07]It's actually, it's behind the building, so you have to peer through that window.
[158:21.09]That's all the way down to the right.
[158:23.83]The Great Wall of China is down there.
[158:25.62]As you know, a lot of history behind that one.
[158:27.90]They built that wall to make sure they could keep the leprechauns from trying to get into China.
[158:37.01]They used to have a big leprechaun problem.
[158:38.41]You know, China borders Ireland.
[158:40.71]It was a large issue.
[158:44.93]Yeah, the bike is stuck.
[158:49.13]There we go.
[158:49.37]I'm not supposed to be doing this.
[159:00.88]There we are!
[159:04.26]Stop the joke.
[159:05.96]Never!
[159:07.76]I'll never stop.
[159:08.52]I'll never stop joking!
[159:22.55]There it is.
[159:23.01]It's the Great Wall of China.
[159:23.95]He's joking about his stuff.
[159:25.57]Can't stop me.
[159:25.97]Yeah, that was a funny movie.
[159:26.93]Haha, this is who I am.
[159:28.09]I'm funny.
[159:42.24]Oh shit, we got a monk that's mad at us.
[159:53.19]Oh, this lady's freaking me out.
[159:56.37]Later with the groceries.
[159:57.17]Always the grocery bag.
[159:57.97]Alright, let's just get this over with.
[160:12.79]Wiggle, wiggle.
[160:18.43]Can you even fall off a bike?
[160:21.08]I don't think you can.
[160:22.56]If I drive full speed directly into another car, I don't think I'll fall off.
[160:26.42]Maybe we can learn moves here?
[160:48.25]So what is she doing here?
[160:50.05]Can I help you?
[160:51.15]Yeah, I'd like to sign up for some Kung Fu classes.
[160:54.53]I read about your school in my guidebook.
[160:56.67]Why does she look like an Overwatch NPC?
[161:00.29]She looks like she belongs walking around inside the museum in the cutscene.
[161:05.21]You want to take classes, okay.
[161:08.37]And you, did you also read about this place in some book?
[161:13.87]Well, I... Wait.
[161:16.71]I know you.
[161:19.12]Yes, Sifu Kwa.
[161:21.25]I used to be your student.
[161:23.41]I'm Wei, Wei Shen.
[161:26.17]Ah, yes.
[161:27.67]The one who went to America.
[161:30.59]So you brought this girl back with you.
[161:34.45]Oh, no, I didn't actually.
[161:36.11]Very good.
[161:37.54]Now time to assess your skill level in Kung Fu.
[161:40.92]Alright, I'm excited to learn some new stuff.
[161:49.76]Hold.
[161:51.06]That's not correct.
[161:51.76]I don't know why you're doing that.
[161:54.86]Oh, sorry.
[161:55.68]My bad.
[161:56.84]My Xbox controller just... Like, you know how this does.
[161:59.55]Sometimes it just doesn't work.
[162:02.51]Hold LT to lock on to... While locked on, use movement plus X to strike in different directions.
[162:11.54]Cool.
[162:12.82]Attack each student with a directional strike.
[162:16.30]Sure thing.
[162:21.12]Interesting.
[162:24.75]That is actually very helpful.
[162:27.43]Sweep kick knockdown.
[162:28.59]Practice sweep kick on the student.
[162:31.69]So it's one and then hold.
[162:38.84]Cool.
[162:43.48]Now defeat him.
[162:49.35]He's trying to do the things I learned.
[162:51.09]Hold on.
[162:59.91]I can beat these fucking shitty students.
[163:09.43]Back this way.
[163:14.17]Sweep him.
[163:15.37]Stomp on his head.
[163:16.25]Okay.
[163:17.86]The combat actually is pretty fun.
[163:21.78]Feels less forgiving than Batman.
[163:24.10]I made that joke earlier, but it's for real.
[163:29.35]Because in some of those, man, especially in Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War, it's almost impossible to get hit sometimes if you just press Y at the worst possible time.
[163:42.67]Jade Rat.
[163:44.84]song dynasty right very good song dynasty that's like a thousand years old or something that's real press the attack button after countering to do follow-up counters isn't that what I'm doing I usually am attacking after I counted you used to have the whole set what happened to the others stolen by a former student corrupted by the triads I'm so sorry to hear that sifu so was I
[164:12.42]Batman can get tough.
[164:13.22]I remember playing the Batman challenges and those got insane.
[164:17.48]Those are really hard.
[164:20.68]I should close up.
[164:22.52]It was good to see you again, Wade.
[164:25.38]And your lovely fiance.
[164:27.61]What happened to my costume?
[164:30.39]That was fine.
[164:32.71]What do you want to do now?
[164:34.09]I need to get home, but I will definitely call you later.
[164:40.86]That's the weirdest exchange I've ever had in a game.
[164:45.44]Sweet kick.
[164:47.66]I got Amanda's phone number, workout clothes, and notes.
[164:51.32]Okay.
[164:54.54]Parked a truck in disguise in front of Popstar's court.
[164:56.82]Stake out his next move.
[165:00.42]Now the question is, can I do anything?
[165:03.69]Can I learn more?
[165:05.17]Do I have to have a certain amount of points?
[165:09.37]Talk to one of the thugs to start training.
[165:11.31]How about you?
[165:13.05]Grapplers.
[165:14.65]Can't be grappled, but can't defend either.
[165:17.57]I don't think it teaches me anything, though.
[165:23.09]I think it just gives me an opportunity to train.
[165:25.99]Use a combination of heavy strikes.
[165:27.13]Yeah, they can't block.
[165:29.31]So they... Okay.
[165:31.32]Don't grapple these guys.
[165:37.44]Oh, shit.
[165:58.48]There's prayer to be had.
[166:04.67]Like homie!
[166:14.19]Snap his neck.
[166:14.91]No.
[166:15.77]That didn't work.
[166:23.01]So, these guys grab a lot.
[166:38.56]Alright.
[166:42.73]Cool.
[166:44.79]I mean, they are called grapplers.
[166:46.51]Can I learn anything in here?
[166:52.11]I think this is just fighting different people.
[166:53.49]Brawlers, heavy hitters, armed thugs, strikers.
[166:55.87]Yeah, I don't think I can do anything.
[166:59.79]Well, that was fun while it lasted.
[167:01.30]Bye.
[167:09.87]Need to get statues.
[167:10.79]I'm assuming they're probably scattered around the world like the other stuff in the game is.
[167:18.37]Jade statues.
[167:19.17]Good to know.
[167:21.41]Yeah, I was looking at the... That was in the menu before.
[167:34.79]I just don't know where to get them.
[167:39.05]Get him story missions.
[167:41.21]What is this?
[167:41.67]This is a cop.
[167:42.15]I'm going to do this.
[167:43.49]Random cop mission.
[167:44.13]Let's do it.
[167:48.29]Stop the suspect vehicle.
[167:49.41]Probably could have just done that immediately, but I didn't.
[167:57.43]Oh well.
[168:06.68]Still driving.
[168:08.78]Still going.
[168:12.34]By stop, I think they mean explode.
[168:20.92]Like that.
[168:21.30]Um, is that gonna blow up?
[168:33.40]Oh, the guy fucking lit on fire.
[168:34.70]How was I supposed to do anything about that?
[168:39.40]Um, can I arrest him while he's on the ground like this?
[168:46.58]You're under arrest.
[168:48.99]You're under arrest, a.k.a.
[168:51.19]BURN!
[168:54.23]Gonna have some fucking cooked meat tonight!
[169:00.21]You're under arrest, dickhead.
[169:04.65]Wait, somebody else is in this car.
[169:09.97]Alright.
[169:28.22]Can I arrest him, please?
[169:29.72]He's done.
[169:30.43]I got him in custody.
[169:32.31]I did it.
[169:36.13]Well, yeah, technically they are in one piece.
[169:38.61]You're right.
[169:41.30]Is this the guy that I just arrested?
[169:43.12]No.
[169:44.52]Okay, I got an SUV for that.
[169:49.16]Cool.
[169:49.40]Let me check that out.
[169:55.52]Fish dumpling.
[169:56.18]Give me some.
[169:56.85]That guy has the same red shirt on.
[170:00.81]Alright, what's now?
[170:07.91]Club Bam Bam.
[170:08.51]Let's go.
[170:23.00]Get out of the car.
[170:24.24]Fuck over here.
[170:26.74]You're under arrest.
[170:50.51]Angry?
[170:50.93]The guy ran me over for no reason.
[170:56.63]I do need new clothes, though.
[170:57.77]These clothes are so bad.
[170:59.01]I hate them.
[170:59.51]This is why we need body cams?
[171:02.11]Well, I got run over!
[171:03.33]Yeah.
[171:23.35]Remove mask.
[171:24.23]No, I can't.
[171:24.87]I'm not removing the mask yet.
[171:28.45]Club Bam Bam's down here.
[171:29.45]Ah, that would have been so cool.
[171:32.82]I gotta get that on somebody.
[171:34.98]To time it correctly, the next motorcycle that drives by, I'm gonna do the flying kick into the person's head.
[171:39.74]Off the bike.
[171:42.74]Next one that comes by.
[171:44.20]We'll get it.
[171:45.82]Flying kick.
[171:47.44]In the middle of the travel time.
[171:49.74]Off the bike.
[171:54.49]I hear it.
[171:54.83]Here it comes.
[172:01.99]God damn it!
[172:04.61]Wait, wait.
[172:04.91]Stay there.
[172:05.19]Stay, stay, stay, stay.
[172:05.83]Stay there.
[172:06.11]Stay there.
[172:06.43]Stay there.
[172:09.05]Here we go.
[172:18.38]Only this guy knew what I was trying to do.
[172:24.49]I'll get him at the cutoff up here.
[172:29.37]Fuck!
[172:33.27]What are you doing?
[172:33.99]Stop it.
[172:36.16]I'll get him.
[172:43.64]I hit the windshield.
[172:45.40]I hit his fucking windshield.
[172:51.54]Get off the bike!
[173:06.74]I could go right down the street anyways.
[173:18.50]Alright, somebody pranked me.
[173:20.02]Somebody put a spring-loaded seat on there.
[173:22.52]There was an ejector seat on there and they pressed the button to really just fuck with me.
[173:27.29]Get out of the way.
[173:28.05]This guy doesn't know what to do.
[173:33.65]He's running over that person.
[173:35.85]Oh, this camera.
[173:36.66]Get in the right spot.
[173:46.36]In the club, bam bam.
[173:47.32]What do we got?
[173:48.64]A brawl?
[173:50.28]Fast talk the bouncer and get in the club.
[173:51.81]Oh, it's just QTEs.
[173:55.57]What's he doing?
[173:56.05]Why is the camera zooming in here?
[173:57.17]Odd, okay.
[173:57.43]Odd camera.
[174:20.01]Go inside the club.
[174:22.41]Benny's in the VIP area.
[174:23.53]Make an example.
[174:25.38]Perfect opportunity for a running kick.
[174:27.94]Talk to the VIP bouncer.
[174:29.04]Oh, it's going to be awesome.
[174:31.54]Running kick.
[174:33.28]I've been practicing it for a long time.
[174:38.19]What happened to that guy?
[174:43.03]I want to talk to that guy instead.
[174:46.09]Hey, buddy.
[174:46.85]VIPs only.
[174:49.14]Talk to the hostess.
[174:50.44]I want to climb up there.
[174:51.30]I want to be the center of attention.
[174:53.46]Okay, how are you?
[175:15.05]Hey, what's your name?
[175:16.77]I'm Tiffany.
[175:18.15]Nice to meet you.
[175:19.23]I'm Wei.
[175:20.29]Why is she talking to me so slowly?
[175:23.08]Can you get me into the VIP room?
[175:25.10]Sure.
[175:26.12]Just come with me.
[175:27.08]That easy, guys.
[175:29.78]That's it.
[175:30.52]You have a bit of an accent.
[175:32.36]Are you from around here?
[175:33.56]Yeah, originally, but I was in the States for a long time.
[175:36.77]Oh, that's so cool.
[175:38.05]I always wanted to go.
[175:39.41]So, what's Benny like?
[175:41.21]Benny?
[175:41.93]You mean the manager?
[175:42.97]Yeah.
[175:43.61]Benny's nice enough.
[175:45.22]My VIP room now.
[175:46.04]Alright.
[175:46.30]I'll do my best.
[175:47.64]Choose a song.
[175:48.06]I fought the law.
[175:49.90]I'll pick up the copyright.
[176:16.87]What am I supposed to do?
[176:20.69]Am I singing?
[176:22.79]Okay, I didn't sing.
[176:24.65]Let's try that again.
[176:32.60]Did I turn all the music down?
[176:38.44]How do I sing?
[176:41.32]Oh, I get it.
[176:46.36]You just have to touch it.
[176:54.60]Do Wonderwall?
[176:56.48]It's not that hard.
[177:02.34]I'm just trying to be terrible.
[177:12.66]Bad.
[177:13.02]This is what happens.
[177:15.77]Oh boy.
[177:22.42]Sing or write.
[177:23.12]The lyrics are not on the screen.
[177:24.70]Yes, they are.
[177:25.26]Fuck.
[177:31.82]You think I can do the two things at the same time, guys?
[177:36.59]Why is this not matching up?
[177:38.67]I fought the law and the law... I fought the law and the law won.
[177:44.73]I fought the law and the law won.
[177:46.27]It's not right.
[177:48.01]I fought the law and the...
[177:52.21]88%, thank you.
[177:53.05]What's wrong with my guy?
[177:56.97]VOD muted.
[177:57.37]VOD muted.
[177:58.41]Oh, I know this one, though.
[177:59.67]This is, um... I know this one.
[178:00.83]VOD muted.
[178:20.27]I know that one.
[178:21.25]That one's easy.
[178:22.55]VIP room.
[178:23.43]In here.
[178:48.12]I'm VIP now.
[178:48.88]I get to drink the green ecto-cooler slimer beer.
[178:52.50]Achoo!
[178:52.96]Mustard suit!
[178:53.82]Achoo!
[178:54.02]Achoo!
[178:56.06]He would be so mad.
[179:12.34]Mustard teeth shit
[179:41.87]I can go up here.
[179:43.35]Did they come up?
[179:47.36]Oh, I shouldn't have jumped down.
[179:58.65]Why would I have left?
[180:04.51]I'm going to the bathroom.
[180:08.39]Is anybody in here?
[180:10.47]Will they follow me in the bathroom?
[180:11.77]Oh, I gotta do some toilet drowning, you know what I'm saying?
[180:15.18]Did they come down?
[180:18.44]Yep, they do.
[180:19.86]Okay, let's play this smart.
[180:27.67]We're gonna do a bathroom brawl.
[180:30.84]I need to drown half of them in the toilet.
[180:39.23]It looks like they're coming down.
[180:40.69]Or they're trying to, at least.
[180:44.64]I see a few guys right here.
[180:46.38]Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[180:52.12]What are you doing?
[181:03.76]Get in here.
[181:04.29]You saw where I went.
[181:07.53]You're ruining this whole thing for me, man.
[181:10.64]Don't ruin this for me.
[181:13.46]This is extremely important.
[181:16.68]Shit!
[181:18.38]God damn it.
[181:20.70]I was trying to piss while he came in.
[181:22.69]No, get out of here now.
[181:23.73]Everybody leave.
[181:24.21]That sucks.
[181:25.93]I didn't know being in combat was going to stop that.
[181:27.57]Fuck.
[181:37.02]You fucking idiot.
[181:38.02]What are you doing?
[181:41.60]No.
[181:42.08]Shit!
[181:42.90]I'm so irritated right now.
[181:43.88]That would have been so fucking funny.
[181:50.23]Oh well.
[181:53.27]At least we got to see that.
[181:54.19]I'm gonna be a guy in every single toilet.
[182:09.57]Imagine coming into the bathroom and seeing this.
[182:15.27]I actually might be able to make this work.
[182:17.39]One more guy coming here, and I might go out of combat if this guy's down.
[182:23.08]No, unfortunately.
[182:28.00]It might be possible.
[182:29.34]Come on, go down.
[182:33.73]Out of combat.

[184:39.98]What the hell would you be doing here?
[184:45.93]Oh, fuck off man, really?
[184:52.09]Throw him over the edge.
[184:58.65]I need to wait a minute.

[185:04.07]Is there any healing?
[185:04.69]Can I drink anything?
[185:05.39]No, I just can't get hit.
[185:15.53]Oh, God.
[185:15.99]There's a lot of people here.
[185:18.35]I can't fuck around.
[185:18.93]I actually have to do well here.
[185:20.53]This ain't gonna kill me, right?
[185:23.25]If I jump over this, this is like an FBI role, right?
[185:30.28]I need a good spot.
[185:37.42]Just trust me.
[185:37.86]Everything's going to be fine.
[185:39.22]I need to get a good spot where people aren't going to... Just go.
[185:43.16]Just get out of here.
[185:43.80]Go!
[185:46.06]I didn't kill somebody.
[185:48.20]It's the karaoke room.
[185:49.86]Oh, great.
[185:51.16]Okay, they got a trickle in here one at a time and I got blocked.
[185:52.94]That guy's got a knife.
[186:07.71]Come on.
[186:15.17]I was thinking it was a dodge roll.
[186:17.11]I'm like, I wanna Dark Souls this so bad.
[186:25.30]Oh fuck!
[186:26.84]This is dire, you guys all know it.
[186:45.04]That's the only way I can do it.
[186:48.74]There we go.
[186:50.26]Hey, we're good.
[186:59.31]Give me the knife.
[187:16.06]Into the table.
[187:28.89]Goodbye.
[187:38.61]Get the fuck out of here, bowling ball baby.
[187:43.52]Look, Benny in the bathroom.
[187:45.34]Back to square one.
[187:54.06]Hey, what's happening?
[187:56.61]Hey, what's happening is what you have to say about this.
[188:00.17]Allow me to show you.
[188:08.97]Hey, what's happening?
[188:10.97]Go home, dummy!
[188:17.74]Alright, Benny in the bathroom.
[188:23.10]Oh, he's in the stall over there.
[188:26.30]Here we go.
[188:31.73]Oh, whoops.
[188:38.65]Drown him.
[188:47.70]What?
[188:47.98]Get off me.
[188:49.28]Fuck you.
[188:50.02]Fuck you.
[188:57.93]Really?
[189:01.93]Into the toilet.
[189:02.71]I'm gonna fucking smear you into the bathroom.
[189:05.43]No, that sucks.
[189:06.33]No, it's okay.
[189:06.78]I can still do it.
[189:08.60]What do you do?
[189:10.04]I want to put him into the toilet.
[189:17.31]I'm covered in blood.
[189:18.73]Didn't do the finisher.
[189:20.49]I know.
[189:20.75]Okay.
[189:20.87]We did it.
[189:46.09]Put a civilian in the toilet.
[189:50.03]Uh, I'm not sure I want to do that.
[189:52.89]New karaoke songs, got five grand, and I leveled up once on triad.
[189:56.03]Hmm, it's time.
[189:59.29]Meet me at the arranged location in an hour.
[190:02.76]After I upgrade.
[190:07.65]None of this would have happened if you just talked.
[190:08.90]Yeah.
[190:09.04]Well, I didn't get any cop experience because I threw a guy through glass.
[190:13.38]That had nothing to do with it.
[190:14.60]Your state of mind is important.
[190:34.19]It's important to me.
[190:35.01]It's important to how you do your job.
[190:36.53]Fuck you.
[190:37.21]I do my job just fine.
[190:38.55]Well, that's for me to decide.
[190:39.77]You mean Pendrew.
[190:42.18]Pendrew assigned me as your controller.
[190:43.92]And listen, Wayne.
[190:44.62]Pendrew may not be concerned about you, but I am.
[190:46.90]Yeah, we got to unlock some clothes.
[190:48.82]But this cannot be a vendetta.
[190:50.32]I don't like this costume anymore.
[190:52.52]You're a cop.
[190:53.48]I'm an undercover cop.
[190:54.96]The rules are different.
[190:56.16]And you're fucking concerned about me?
[190:58.16]You are an officer of the law, Wayne.
[190:59.98]Same as me.
[191:01.54]We are not the same.
[191:03.09]You understand?
[191:07.97]The notepad's gonna be unreadable.
[191:15.49]I sleep in this thing.
[191:17.17]You know how bad inside this mask smells right now?
[191:20.89]I haven't washed my hair.
[191:22.47]My hair grease.
[191:26.49]Repeatedly press to cycle through primary objectives.
[191:30.23]Okay, that's cool.
[191:31.19]Drug bust.
[191:34.43]Return the Jade Statue.
[191:35.72]Yeah, let's do that.
[191:38.48]Get this out of the way.
[191:39.22]Let's drink some energy drinks.
[191:49.36]Bike on the bed now.
[191:53.87]Why do I have a turntable in my kitchen?
[191:58.61]Am I spinning records right now?
[192:02.83]Okay, there's no stove.
[192:07.95]Bike on bed or pre-recorded.
[192:09.35]I can't do that right now.
[192:23.19]I did get an SUV, though.
[192:25.63]Dragon armored van.
[192:26.55]Ooh.
[192:28.21]SUV.
[192:29.74]I want the police bike.
[192:31.18]It's fun.
[192:31.96]Ooh.
[192:43.71]This is just to shut everybody up.
[192:47.15]Because I know the chat will not stop.
[192:57.21]Got it.
[192:57.47]There you go.
[192:59.35]Not pre-recorded.
[193:00.08]Okay.
[193:11.04]Alright, let me get out.
[193:15.43]Where am I?
[193:15.85]How did I get in the bathroom?
[193:23.03]Somehow I made it into the bathroom.
[193:27.98]Yeah, we live!
[193:30.32]See?
[193:30.78]I even proved it.
[193:49.64]He's a psychic.
[193:54.61]You can't put people inside the trunk of the bike.
[193:57.93]You can't just lay them along like they're a horse in Red Dead.
[194:02.81]Like they're a person on the horse.
[194:05.06]Let me explain.
[194:05.82]Let me explain.
[194:06.46]Here.
[194:09.16]Like, I can't put this guy, like, lay him on like he's a horse.
[194:15.22]I can't.
[194:15.62]Alright, so just let him go.
[194:18.17]Return the statue!
[194:50.36]I'm ready to make it happen.
[194:55.64]Wow.
[194:59.50]So, what does this do?
[195:01.76]Oh, I have to, okay.
[195:02.84]I think I have to tap.
[195:07.73]Interesting.
[195:15.79]How do I crouch?
[195:23.39]Picked him up.
[195:29.03]How are you doing?
[195:35.57]When I pressed Y, I didn't know I had to tap Y. Yep.
[195:52.68]I'm losing them.
[195:53.41]I lost one of them somehow.
[195:57.07]Slim Jim.
[195:59.29]Glad I had that upgrade.
[196:00.25]That's it for him.
[196:17.75]xkpd let's think xkpd or hkpd alright let's take a look I'm gonna do the dojo which is right over here xkpd I know I know but it sounds like they're saying xkpd that was pretty cool
[196:47.42]I can just rob meters, but I haven't been doing that the whole game.
[196:50.33]Let's learn a new move.
[197:00.64]Got the sweep.
[197:03.57]Play all of Persona 5 or this is pre-recorded.
[197:05.69]I'm not going to play Persona 5.
[197:07.13]Alright, this is important.
[197:32.94]Tackle strike.
[197:34.42]Strike after tackling the enemy.
[197:37.24]Or charge knee stun.
[197:41.96]Stun strike follow-up.
[197:45.32]Leg break grapple combo.
[197:48.95]Disarm tackle.
[197:50.55]I think I like these.
[197:51.47]I like grabbing people.
[197:52.45]Stun grapple follow-up.
[197:55.61]Arm break.
[197:58.23]Yeah, we're going with the tackle strike.
[198:01.42]Knee?
[198:01.66]Why do you want me to do the knee?
[198:03.63]We got a leg break and an arm break up here.
[198:11.04]A and then BX.
[198:11.92]That's not that hard to remember.
[198:19.71]That is pretty good, though.
[198:21.03]The stun.
[198:24.98]Let's go.
[198:25.26]I'm getting it.
[198:27.92]It's hold A and then you grab.
[198:30.06]So tackle, strike, hold A. And then plus B. Okay, let's see.
[198:43.09]That's not it.
[198:43.99]Where'd he go?
[198:46.41]Oh.
[198:46.55]There it is.
[198:56.87]Mean that's cool.
[198:57.57]It's not great but Defeat the students.
[199:00.72]Well, let's go Oh
[199:26.44]Get away from me, there's too many.
[199:30.28]Alright, well, I did it.
[199:33.28]Tackle strike.
[199:56.91]Not bad.
[199:59.57]Pretty decent.
[200:01.45]I was going to just, for some reason, test it out on this lady, and that would not be smart.
[200:07.35]Alright, what do we got?
[200:08.42]We got... Get evidence on Popstar, or a cop job, or Ting's t-shirt.
[200:16.96]Let's get the evidence.
[200:20.40]Jaywalking.
[200:22.56]Yep, jaywalking.
[200:24.14]No, it's not worth it.
[200:24.92]I have too many cop points to lose.
[200:26.16]I need a taxi.
[200:31.18]Taxi!
[200:37.51]Anybody?
[200:37.83]Anybody got a taxi?
[200:45.53]Anybody?
[200:53.25]Whoa!
[200:56.20]Oh, that's a nice car.
[200:57.46]Fuck.
[201:01.20]Why won't you shoot the gun?
[201:09.06]Shooting at a guy that just stole the car.
[201:14.49]Taxi!
[201:25.40]Wired.
[201:27.28]Wire 5.
[201:27.84]He did.
[201:31.20]Got to lose the cops first.
[201:36.21]I'm just going to drive.
[201:37.03]We just got to lose them.
[201:38.43]Taxi drove.
[201:39.23]Wait, that was a taxi.
[201:40.05]That was that one.
[201:56.02]Slow it down.
[201:56.92]We'll catch up and I'll ram him.
[202:03.04]N-A cops?
[202:03.88]Guys, this is not in... N-A!
[202:08.20]This is not in America.
[202:11.01]Oh yeah, that fucking N-A cops.
[202:27.18]No, you just drive into a tree already.
[202:29.06]Alright, his car's gonna explode.
[202:39.57]Alright, give me a taxi.
[202:49.05]Hell's Kitchen Cops?
[202:51.39]Here we go.
[202:57.61]I need a ride.
[203:01.03]No, I held it down.
[203:02.31]I held it down.
[203:04.19]Get back in your car.
[203:13.35]God damn it.
[203:14.05]I held it down.
[203:14.83]An idiot.
[203:27.78]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[203:30.26]Hold.
[203:31.20]I'm trying to hold.
[203:33.22]Why?
[203:36.74]Why is it automatically doing this?
[203:38.54]You've seen this move?
[203:47.31]I'm holding.
[203:48.03]Why?
[203:50.87]Don't ask me why it didn't work.
[203:54.87]Okay.
[203:55.45]This is strike three.
[203:58.87]Excuse me.
[203:59.89]Hold Y. My goodness.
[204:00.85]What was the 70%?
[204:02.01]70% what?
[204:03.13]70%.
[204:04.35]Wait for the pop star in the chicken van.
[204:31.91]We're driving out with chickens?
[204:35.33]We'll have to go around the corner.
[204:38.25]I was tired.
[204:43.15]Oh, finally.
[204:44.09]$310 to go two blocks.
[204:46.37]Yeah, it was supercharged Uber mode.
[204:49.39]It was like some party going on with like 50 million people were in town.
[204:52.37]Yeah, Microsoft announced that they're making a decentralized internet at E3.
[205:02.73]And every president that's ever lived is going to be there to see it.
[205:06.20]And if you sign up and you get a ticket, you get $1,000 in cash at the front door.
[205:11.82]Everyone.
[205:13.81]So, I mean, it makes sense that it would be $310 on those surge prices.
[205:41.31]I just wanted to see what was gonna happen if I beeped at him.
[205:45.00]That's a big amount of suspicion.
[206:02.97]Okay, I didn't know he was gonna stop that short.
[206:21.02]How much suspicion do you get for flipping them the bird?
[206:22.81]I don't think you can even do that in this game.
[206:25.75]You can do that in GTA 5.
[206:29.79]I guess we're going to climb onto the roof.
[206:35.61]Move to the low wall and press LB to cover.
[206:39.05]Wait for the deal to go down.
[206:45.67]If only I had a rock I could just throw behind my head.
[206:53.54]Photograph him.
[206:54.21]Camera.
[206:54.41]It's good.
[206:55.03]Good photo.
[206:55.27]Why'd it jump off?
[207:24.03]Now, take another picture.
[207:25.87]Photograph him in the act.
[207:32.34]In the act.
[207:33.12]Right when he snorts.
[207:33.70]I mean, that's not the act.
[207:38.76]That's him looking behind him.
[207:40.86]Okay, I think we're good.
[207:47.55]Which only hits the docks.
[207:57.59]Break in and steal the stuff, right?
[208:10.62]Tail him to the deal.
[208:17.00]Get close to the guard to talk your way past him.
[208:21.89]What are you... Oh, I'm pretending to be drunk or something.
[208:26.63]Okay.
[208:27.38]Hey, dude.
[208:27.76]Statue.
[208:28.24]I can puke on command?
[208:31.02]I can puke on command?
[208:34.07]What kind of a fucking weirdo am I?
[208:39.05]He was in mid-puke.
[209:03.78]He just puked in my face.
[209:06.26]Hold on.
[209:10.12]He needs to throw up in my face.
[209:11.58]I'm sorry, guys.
[209:12.20]That guy has to puke in my face.
[209:16.20]I'm gonna get close.
[209:34.10]I can't walk.
[209:34.62]There we go.
[209:42.66]There.
[209:47.24]Now I want him to throw up in my face.
[209:49.46]God damn it!
[209:55.95]He didn't... I thought he was...
[210:03.21]What's going on?
[210:03.63]Oh.
[210:07.55]I gotta grab at the exact right time.
[210:20.91]Is the joke funny yet?
[210:21.89]I'm not- I'm just trying to do something- I'm just trying to get him to do something to me.
[210:27.07]Jump in the water when he starts- No, I'm not gonna do that anymore.
[210:33.37]I wanna grab him so he throws up in my face.
[210:35.09]But I'm not gonna do it anymore.
[210:37.57]Here he goes.
[210:37.93]There he goes.
[211:08.51]Need a statue.
[211:12.27]Well, that was easy to get.
[211:16.91]Any more photos I need to take?
[211:28.55]Who's talking?
[211:29.17]Oh, these guys are talking.
[211:29.97]Should I take another picture?
[211:30.75]No.
[211:41.54]Something I can make a phone call.
[211:44.74]Probably should hide.
[211:46.56]Photograph him in the act.
[211:55.26]Did I get it?
[211:55.76]Yeah, I had to.
[212:03.13]Call.
[212:04.27]I got him.
[212:05.59]So did Popstar.
[212:06.47]Two shots in the chest.
[212:08.21]Sets down the drug pipeline at least.
[212:10.07]Should I be following them right now?
[212:11.77]Okay.
[212:12.05]I didn't need to do anything.
[212:13.27]There's a guy that was thrown up before.
[212:15.59]Is he gone?
[212:16.07]Is he over here?
[212:41.33]No, there's some deal breaker.
[212:47.68]Puke guy, I think, went somewhere else.
[212:55.56]Back in the chicken van.
[213:10.41]After I turn this in, I'm gonna go take this.
[213:12.91]I'll come back.
[213:17.48]How did I get the cops on me?
[213:23.16]I'm a guy in a chicken van.
[213:24.76]Is that illegal?
[213:31.78]Apparently it's illegal to drive around chickens.
[213:38.34]Don't ask me why that's real.
[213:46.85]Alright, just get in front of me.
[213:51.54]Please.
[213:51.90]Alright, there's another radio station, somebody was saying.
[214:01.15]What about this one?
[214:02.89]Bunga Chicken.
[214:04.13]That feels pretty fitting.
[214:22.75]Park the chicken van in the garage and get up.
[214:27.33]I'm gonna open a window because the dead animal smell in this room is starting to like give me a headache.
[214:34.41]I swear to God.
[214:35.13]By the way, I got grubby clothes.
[214:54.58]By the way, if you don't know what's going on here, come to the restaurant.
[215:00.42]So, I don't know where they're coming from.
[215:02.60]I don't know why they're coming in.
[215:04.28]But it's animals.
[215:05.12]I don't know if they're mice, rats, squirrels.
[215:08.65]I don't know what it is.
[215:09.35]But something keeps finding its way into the walls of this house and dying in the wall.
[215:15.99]And then it just smells like the inside of a trash can in here.
[215:26.60]It happened once before, and it happened again.
[215:28.39]Now I gotta get someone to come, like, examine the house.
[215:34.93]Someone has to come... I have to get, like, the pest guy to come and check it out.
[215:40.05]It sucks.
[215:41.69]If you've ever had this happen before... It's... You can't do anything.
[215:48.25]It's the worst thing ever.
[215:48.85]There's just a dead animal in the...
[215:54.62]There's a dead animal in the wall.
[215:56.72]I can't... What, am I gonna rip the wall open?
[215:59.82]I'm not gonna do... I don't know where it is.
[216:00.94]I'm gonna be putting holes in my wall looking for a mouse.
[216:05.09]You can't do anything about it.
[216:06.27]Yeah, I got clotheslined.
[216:23.76]I'm gonna go eat some food, too, after this.
[216:25.80]Well, not, I mean, like, in-game, I mean.
[216:32.94]You just said it was in the wall.
[216:34.00]Yeah, I can't get into the wall.
[216:35.58]Yeah, I heard.
[216:43.49]A stream sniper is stuck in the wall.
[216:46.01]That guy has the golden gun from Goldeneye.
[216:49.43]That kills anybody in one shot.
[217:05.71]They clear the spirits out with a medium?
[217:26.81]Yeah, and now that you say that, that's definitely spray paint.
[217:28.85]That's not even real gold.
[217:29.59]Whoa.
[217:29.71]Whoa.
[217:29.87]I'm just going to clean that up now.
[217:53.88]Fucking rat.
[217:54.52]I don't know what wall he's in, but he's in one of these walls.
[217:57.63]We're gonna clean him out.
[217:59.53]Statue?
[218:00.01]I don't... Found the smell.
[218:19.54]You know why it's the worst?
[218:21.42]I'll explain this to you.
[218:23.60]So, my house is forced hot air.
[218:28.44]So what that means, if you don't know and understand what I'm talking about, I have a burner down here.
[218:32.50]It's a furnace that takes in air.
[218:34.92]It sucks air in and the pilot essentially makes a giant fire inside the furnace and burns the air.
[218:42.59]It warms the air up and it shoves it around the whole house.
[218:45.43]Every single inch of my house, right?
[218:47.07]Keep it together.
[218:48.45]So, uh, because the smell is in the room right here where the furnace is, it is sucking smelly dead animal air into the intake and putting it around the whole fucking house.
[219:08.03]So it's not fun.
[219:12.35]Possible murder.
[219:14.07]Okay.
[219:22.26]every time ladies stop hanging out here haven't you figured it out by now a crazy person lives that guy just sneezed that guy just sneezed you think you would stop hanging out in front of my house
[219:46.50]You have a furnace in your computer room.
[219:48.42]No.
[219:48.72]No, the furnace... I'm down... Put the phone down.
[219:57.07]The furnace is next door, right in the other room.
[219:59.47]Right next to me over here.
[220:00.81]I'm down in my basement.
[220:04.35]My basement down here is where my computer and all my stuff and equipment and electronics are.
[220:11.88]Yeah, I'm vaping rat fumes.
[220:21.90]I want the money in this thing.
[220:26.92]I want the money inside this.
[220:28.55]I can't get it.
[220:32.93]Alright, what do we got?
[220:40.14]New case.
[220:41.08]Return the Jade Statue.
[220:42.08]That's what we're gonna do.
[220:53.62]I'm inhaling rat fumes live.
[220:58.38]You're gonna fight me?
[221:02.44]You're gonna fight me now?
[221:04.15]You're going to fight me because of that.
[221:06.63]Did you see what just happened to me?
[221:10.69]You gotta be out of your mind.
[221:30.65]Myth busted.
[221:35.01]There's all kinds of funny things happening with that statement.
[221:47.70]Myth busted.
[221:50.73]I found one of your statues.
[221:53.30]It's the statue of the Chaser.
[221:55.00]I promised myself I wouldn't train members of the Triads anymore.
[221:59.80]Not good for one's karma.
[222:01.28]What makes you think I'm in the Triads?
[222:03.02]Don't lie to me.
[222:04.60]If there are things you can't reveal... You see the thing you did with your mouth there?
[222:08.44]You just barely cocked your lip at the side there.
[222:11.72]And I closed a little and winced.
[222:16.29]And you looked over to the left side of the room.
[222:18.66]Why'd you do that?
[222:19.68]Lie to me.
[222:20.08]The show was like only one season and it was so stupid.
[222:25.36]The show based around a guy who could tell when you lied and he was a detective.
[222:29.39]The show was fucking awful.
[222:32.47]No wonder it was canned immediately.
[222:34.11]Alright, let's go leg break.
[222:37.79]Uh-huh.
[222:43.89]So it's grapple.
[222:46.17]And then...
[222:52.70]That's painful.
[222:53.54]Why am I gonna do it to this guy again?
[222:56.60]This poor guy, he only has two legs.
[223:02.22]This student, this student, this dude is seriously like, how old is this kid?
[223:10.87]Jesus Christ.
[223:16.02]The same kid.
[223:19.18]Alright, I want another student.
[223:29.84]Well, that's cool.
[223:30.36]That's easy to do, too, and it stuns him.
[223:34.58]He's done.
[223:36.62]Take the other leg.
[223:40.57]I keep breaking the same leg.
[223:41.65]Oh, I thought he was saying, please, stop.
[223:58.76]He's getting a lot, very bloody.
[224:02.86]Leg break.
[224:03.70]Sounds good to me.
[224:05.92]Keep going.
[224:08.08]Interesting way to, I could just say, hey, Jerma.
[224:10.88]Hey, Jerma, hey!
[224:13.06]Interesting way to get on the bike, though.
[224:14.22]Alright, let's go.
[224:17.25]In case, listening in for, let me do this.
[224:23.21]Let me do a favorite for somebody.
[224:31.49]Who's this favorite for?
[224:32.27]Okay, unlock some shirts?
[224:33.47]Okay.
[224:33.61]Take a few pictures.
[225:02.49]That's not cool.
[225:03.23]I can't take a photo.
[225:04.47]I was going to zoom in on her face and take a photo and give it back to her.
[225:25.85]I just did.
[225:26.59]I just crashed into you, actually.
[225:29.71]Interesting that you say that.
[225:35.10]Fuck you!
[225:35.90]I hope you crash!
[225:45.08]I was gonna try to rip the ice cream cone out of that guy's hands.
[225:52.09]Holy shit.
[225:52.81]Okay.
[225:53.21]Let's go up here.
[226:03.02]This is the movie studio, right?
[226:04.28]Didn't they... When Emma Stone saw this, she was like, Oh, wow!
[226:07.02]They filmed a movie here!
[226:08.06]This is the Monk Movie Studio.
[226:14.86]Look for cases.
[226:15.82]I knew it.
[226:16.60]You know?
[226:17.42]There has to be shit around here.
[226:18.44]Only one more of these, right?
[226:29.68]Do I like Emma?
[226:31.89]Deck Emma Stone.
[226:35.30]Yeah, I mean, she's cool.
[226:36.90]I guess.
[226:43.75]Case.
[226:46.41]There it is.
[226:47.19]Level up.
[226:54.33]Max health increase.
[227:00.68]But do you like Liger?
[227:02.24]Liger.
[227:14.72]Photography.
[227:15.50]Take a picture of the temple shrine.
[227:18.76]I will do that, and I also get a statue as well.
[227:21.12]Sounds like fun.
[227:28.17]How's that?
[227:33.13]Good.
[227:36.67]Go to the highway seawall.
[227:47.40]What's that?
[227:48.60]What's that, iSpy?
[227:52.63]With my little eye.
[227:56.37]Oh, no, they're just $50,000.
[227:59.39]You monks didn't do a good job hiding your money.
[228:01.81]Is that it?
[228:05.84]I think that's it.
[228:10.80]Wait, let me just check up here.
[228:14.61]Get up there.
[228:18.69]Nothing else.
[228:20.89]Okay.
[228:30.92]There's my bike.
[228:47.03]Nope, sorry.
[228:48.80]That guy turned into- that guy turned into jelly.
[228:51.84]Yes he did.
[228:54.80]No cops.
[228:55.28]A little out of control there, yeah.
[229:04.72]Think of being out of control.
[229:08.90]Wait, why did the GPS update?
[229:11.64]Stop updating.
[229:14.60]Seesaw motor functions.
[229:16.85]Seesaw motor functions.
[229:20.03]Oh, I can't.
[229:29.43]Damn it.
[229:44.28]I mean, you know, I want to say something.
[229:47.86]I want to crash going full speed into this and fly off into the ocean.
[229:52.66]It'll be the most majestic thing you've ever seen.
[229:56.94]There's a very specific way this has to be done.
[229:59.70]So we have to drive on the other side of the road.
[230:02.31]And drive straight into a car.
[230:04.85]And fly over this median.
[230:07.51]Technically, right?
[230:08.09]Let's see.
[230:08.45]We need a car to come this way.
[230:12.63]We really needed a car to come this way.
[230:18.17]It's fucking too late.
[230:28.98]It's a generic tuber joke.
[230:32.76]I mean, is it though?
[230:34.35]Would a generic tuber take the amount of time it takes to do this?
[230:38.99]I'm not sure they would.
[230:42.95]I'm convinced I don't think they would.
[230:55.80]What is the GPS trying to get me to do here?
[230:59.22]It keeps turning around.
[231:00.27]I'm gonna go over here.
[231:13.21]Why is the GPS telling me to do this?
[231:25.49]What the fuck would have... I'm so confused.
[231:30.77]Oh, that would have been a bullet!
[231:41.06]I'm not happy about that.
[231:46.70]Not happy about that.
[231:48.54]There was an opportunity there.
[231:49.58]Oh, we can give it a rest.
[232:00.40]Let me do some leg breaking.
[232:01.74]They get actually scared about that.
[232:03.92]That's awesome.
[232:08.90]See you later.
[232:12.62]Into the ocean with you.
[232:13.32]I thought that guy died.
[232:26.91]Lockbox.
[232:35.37]Alright, into position.
[232:37.51]Take a picture of the sunset.
[232:44.38]Sunset.
[232:45.74]This is a pretty awful picture for a sunset.
[232:50.60]Who would want this as a sunset picture?
[232:52.52]Wait, what?
[233:20.09]Uh, sorry.
[233:20.69]I just can't resist a camera.
[233:26.35]That was unnecessary?
[233:27.31]Well, it told me to beat him up!
[233:37.04]Annoyed.
[233:39.16]New case.
[233:39.88]And I actually have a Jade Statue to return again.
[233:41.62]So let's return the Jade Statue!
[233:42.96]What do you say?
[233:55.43]Get up there.
[234:26.06]I'm running out of jokes?
[234:27.16]No, I'm just, I'm not, I'm trying, I'm trying to just play the game.
[234:29.97]Not everything has to be fucking funny.
[234:41.93]For instance, not everything has to be funny.
[234:52.61]Let's go.
[234:55.31]How did I live through that?
[234:57.19]I don't know how the fuck I'm alive.
[234:59.15]I just like swanton bomb.
[235:11.91]Get out of here.
[235:24.65]And... Welcome!
[235:28.16]Through here.
[235:28.62]I think I'm just going to keep going down this tree.
[235:31.34]I don't think there's a reason to stop.
[235:33.72]Let's do this for this guy first, though.
[235:38.32]Is it Matthew McConaughey?
[235:41.81]Alright, alright, alright.
[235:47.99]It's an interesting cigarette.
[235:49.75]Fight club.
[235:52.80]Time to make some money.
[235:59.18]Any rules here?
[236:00.02]Apparently there's no rules.
[236:06.32]That was a very elaborate scream.
[236:09.47]I can't throw that guy overboard.
[236:12.63]Is it way too much?
[236:40.68]I can't do that this time, I don't think.
[236:43.12]Get out of-
[237:04.34]I wanna just throw them fucking overboard.
[237:06.26]Is that so hard to understand?
[237:07.56]Alright, just break his fucking leg.
[237:32.87]Alright, well, they have to be a certain health percentage.
[237:34.73]Oh, fat guy.
[237:39.91]This is not good.
[237:48.97]Get off.
[237:49.35]Get off.
[237:51.91]Come on.
[237:52.23]I didn't fucking stop that.
[237:53.22]I pressed Y like a thousand times.
[238:03.01]Scare him.
[238:03.73]Bye.
[238:35.01]There's a lot of people around here they get these gonna be throwing like rocks and shit and knives aren't they Five of six You with me
[239:08.93]You.
[239:09.75]With me.
[239:16.24]Break his fucking leg.
[239:18.28]Scare the people around us.
[239:19.40]Get out of here.
[239:26.90]Come on.
[239:28.93]Whoops.
[239:41.12]I just love fucking snapping legs.
[239:42.81]That sounds really fucked up for me to say as like a person, but we're not people right now.
[239:50.69]We're video game characters.
[240:00.31]I just love snapping legs.
[240:03.01]Alright, final round.
[240:04.35]A lot of people here.
[240:14.09]Ooh, didn't see that coming.
[240:33.17]Sorry, I have to concentrate.
[240:46.16]We want to... Oh!
[240:47.68]You do.
[241:02.29]Playing the game.
[241:07.79]Yeah, I'm playing the video game right now.
[241:10.23]And I need to concentrate.
[241:11.31]Because I want the free shit at the end of this.
[241:18.94]Oh, no, no, no, get him off.
[241:22.28]Goodbye.
[241:29.84]I did it.
[241:30.44]He has to be doing a McConaughey impression.
[241:39.00]So, Shen, Zen.
[241:43.49]I guess I got new clothes.
[241:49.00]All drinks are more effective.
[241:49.94]That's cool.
[241:54.41]Oh, wait.
[241:55.01]The reason why I came here in the first place was to get the statue.
[242:04.23]I could have just walked.
[242:07.94]I found one of your statues.
[242:10.40]Now be the Oscar.
[242:11.26]Alright, I'm going to go put the Oscar costume on.
[242:13.38]Let's go.
[242:14.14]She was an addict.
[242:14.90]She couldn't kick it.
[242:16.14]It's not a very interesting story.
[242:17.94]I suppose.
[242:19.45]In light of that, your chosen career is rather interesting.
[242:23.35]We want Gloom in.
[242:24.31]Me anyway, knowing who you are.
[242:26.75]You asked me once not to lie to you.
[242:29.21]And I think in return, you shouldn't ask me about my career.
[242:32.65]Fair enough.
[242:33.19]Alright, I think we're going to stay down.
[242:36.45]What would you like to learn?
[242:38.49]What's this one?
[242:39.61]Disarm tackle.
[242:42.54]Disarm the enemy after tackling them from a sprint.
[242:45.96]Maybe we should do this.
[242:49.56]Your charged knee stuns opponents.
[242:55.18]Stun strike follow up.
[242:58.96]This looks pretty cool.
[243:02.20]That's the Liu Kang.
[243:04.14]In Mortal Kombat.
[243:06.32]Looks pretty good.
[243:07.24]Let's just get it
[243:11.72]X, X, and then hold X. It's just a stun.
[243:21.01]Sweep.
[243:23.43]Kick.
[243:25.83]Kick.
[243:27.29]That's cool.
[243:29.75]Excuse me, I'm trying to learn.
[243:36.01]Lots of combos.
[243:37.09]Lots of calories.
[243:41.68]That's going to get really, really good to use.
[243:52.41]Yeah, I'll do the other upgrades too.
[243:58.59]I had a blood mustache.
[244:01.31]Let's do... Let me get to my upgrade tree.
[244:12.00]Where's my upgrade tree?
[244:14.80]Alright, cop upgrades.
[244:16.74]Action dismount.
[244:17.44]Way can enter slow motion aiming while leaping from a vehicle at high speed.
[244:33.39]These are kind of boring, but I'm going to get it.
[244:42.39]Strike resistant.
[244:45.23]Strike damage bonus.
[244:46.35]Surprise exchange.
[244:47.31]Lock on and press A to roll over an enemy to face their back.
[244:50.70]That's the Batman thing.
[244:51.80]I'm going to do it.
[244:54.42]Just another way to get around people.
[245:01.26]Health upgrades.
[245:02.26]Okay.
[245:05.08]Okay.
[245:13.55]So what's on the list here?
[245:17.88]New case.
[245:18.94]Listening in.
[245:20.98]We're on this one.
[245:21.94]Let's stay on this one.
[245:26.30]I am going to go get the glue man costume.
[245:27.82]I need to find the right spot for that, though.
[245:31.24]Where is it?
[245:35.08]There it is.
[245:37.36]Legendary outfits.
[245:42.91]Gonna run around as the fucking Oscar.
[245:45.15]And the game's gonna be impossible to lose.
[245:47.16]Why are you saying crunk right now?
[245:59.61]Crunk?
[246:00.81]You're really gonna start saying crunk right now?
[246:08.95]It's in here.
[246:09.69]God damn it.
[246:14.26]I'll take one.
[246:22.46]Thanks, Kronk.
[246:25.46]That makes me want one of those.
[246:26.38]Took two licks and that's it.
[246:29.19]I am the knight!
[246:45.86]I didn't think that was actually possible.
[246:50.44]What a psycho.
[246:52.27]Alright, we're fine.
[246:57.13]Oh my god.
[246:58.19]That ice cream was so good.
[246:59.67]Let's turn photo.
[247:00.79]75,000 goddamn dollars.
[247:01.61]Am I actually gonna do this right now?
[247:11.84]There.
[247:12.04]There you go, guys.
[247:12.52]This is so stupid.
[247:13.04]I hate this.
[247:13.38]I don't want to have this on.
[247:14.16]The Oscar.
[247:14.56]Here you go.
[247:41.84]That was an awkward thing to say to somebody.
[247:45.32]This is making me hungry.
[247:46.66]One at a time, please.
[247:48.42]I hate this outfit.
[248:06.26]Let's just eat a bunch of stuff.
[248:07.30]Rose duck.
[248:08.22]Do all romance missions in this outfit.
[248:11.13]Mac and cheese.
[248:13.11]What else can I sample here?
[248:14.47]Fish dumpling.
[248:14.99]I didn't even eat that.
[248:15.69]I just put it on the ground.
[248:47.78]That's a fucking horror movie.
[248:55.77]That is fucked up.
[248:57.37]Oh, that guy's shit.
[248:59.17]Oh, that's gonna take weeks of recovery.
[249:03.41]That guy's store is gonna- he's gonna have so many problems.
[249:06.65]I just costed that guy like two grand.
[249:09.98]Oh, wow dragon kick.
[249:14.96]I'll take one.
[249:15.50]Alright, let's go.
[249:31.85]I gotta get out of here before I do anything else.
[249:34.63]Before I do anything else awful, I need to leave.
[249:36.56]I'm just a villain.
[249:42.24]What do you got over here?
[249:47.53]He's got all three.
[249:48.65]Alright, get me out.
[249:55.43]How do I get out of here?
[249:57.65]That girl just dodge rolled me.
[249:59.95]No, wait, hold on, there's crabs.
[250:02.33]Hold on a minute.
[250:03.61]There's crabs over here.
[250:18.79]I gotta get out of here.
[250:20.15]I couldn't get her in the case.
[250:23.82]I gotta get out.
[250:24.86]Where's the exit?
[250:28.25]I was trying to put her head in the ground.
[250:31.21]Oh, that's not even a good excuse.
[250:32.86]I shouldn't even be trying to do that.
[250:38.11]Maniac.
[250:57.91]I've lost control.
[250:58.63]I gotta get out of here.
[251:01.13]I actually have to leave this area.
[251:02.16]I've lost total control.
[251:08.96]Where am I?
[251:13.36]Get me out!
[251:13.92]I think I made it.
[251:16.60]Is this the exit?
[251:32.52]Can't wait, I can't help but stop.
[251:34.16]This way.
[251:36.62]I found it.
[251:38.10]Right over here.
[251:39.20]Why would I do that?
[251:42.06]I don't know.
[251:43.12]I felt like it.
[251:45.54]Have you ever seen Westworld?
[252:05.75]This is Westworld, guys.
[252:07.47]You come in.
[252:08.11]You shoot something.
[252:09.89]You fuck around.
[252:14.09]Stop looking so far into it.
[252:19.13]You've never... Wait, you've never seen Westworld.
[252:22.49]How could you have not seen Westworld?
[252:32.56]I am not a black hat.
[252:35.11]I'm a grey hat.
[252:38.56]No, I'm a bronze hat, as you can see.
[252:45.50]It's too violent for me.
[252:47.10]Am I gonna have a problem?
[252:52.51]I'm gonna watch TV.
[252:55.73]I mean, I don't really watch TV either, but Westworld is kind of just one of those shows that is just very popular and pretty interesting.
[253:07.76]TV in 2018.
[253:11.16]Get it on iTunes.
[253:19.41]Who has HBO?
[253:21.19]You just get the app.
[253:21.83]Let's get HBO now.
[253:29.71]It's a great show.
[253:32.67]There's a drug bust.
[253:33.64]I'm going to do this.
[253:34.44]I'm right here.
[253:34.96]Might as well do it.
[253:41.84]Um... Is that a double fisting food?
[253:47.35]He is.
[253:49.01]Am I supposed to do something about this?
[253:50.23]Um... Oh.
[254:17.71]Drug bust!
[254:28.44]I can't grab you?
[254:29.12]Right in the face.
[254:42.86]Break his leg.
[254:43.64]Snap his leg in half.
[254:45.36]Good work.
[254:45.82]Ooh, that hurt.
[254:49.79]Can't grab him.
[254:51.31]Well, that didn't work with you.
[254:55.01]Drip him!
[254:55.57]What?
[254:55.89]Get out of here with that shit.
[255:22.24]Oh, fuck.
[255:23.96]Can't grab you either.
[255:28.57]Give me a break.
[255:29.71]I can't pick up his weapon.
[256:00.83]Mm-mm.
[256:04.15]There it is.
[256:05.21]Drug bust.
[256:06.62]Can I get a cleaver too?
[256:07.50]Okay.
[256:12.76]I need to hack the camera now too?
[256:16.18]You're gonna run away from me now?
[256:20.80]Cut his fucking hands off.
[256:24.02]Okay, so I'm gonna hack this again.
[256:28.25]What am I hacking exactly?
[256:33.97]Do you guys see anything to hack?
[256:42.54]Hack.
[256:43.52]Usually it's a thing on the wall, right?
[256:47.74]There's somebody up there.
[256:48.54]Maybe it's down here.
[256:58.07]I do not see something to hack.
[257:02.97]Blinking green light.
[257:10.57]Why would that be on a basketball court?
[257:11.95]Oh, there it is, okay.
[257:12.43]Alright, let's go.
[257:20.11]Same thing, we gotta get the puzzle right.
[257:23.37]Six attempts remaining, we're gonna do nine, eight, seven, six.
[257:30.07]nine is correct but it's in the wrong place let's go with five four three two three is correct as well not in the right place let's go with nine one zero let's go nine how about that okay alright getting there nine and one zero are correct
[258:00.03]Hmm.
[258:00.97]It is in the wrong spot.
[258:03.12]9 is probably here.
[258:03.98]Let's try 9, 1, 0.
[258:07.82]9 is in the right place.
[258:16.86]Fuck!
[258:17.14]9 is in the right place, 0 in 1, switch 0 in 1.
[258:25.92]There it is.
[258:28.60]Right?
[258:28.84]I did it.
[258:29.68]I did it.
[258:30.32]I did it.
[258:30.72]I did it.
[258:33.69]I didn't fail it.
[258:34.41]I did it.
[258:34.77]What are you talking about?
[258:35.59]I fucking did it.
[258:41.47]Fucking 30,000 IQ chat.
[258:51.08]What the fuck happened?
[258:54.24]What?
[258:56.89]Alright, we've got... Let me do this.
[259:11.95]Let's go.
[259:13.37]This is Sleeping Dogs.
[259:14.35]What's wrong?
[259:15.43]Can I help you with something?
[259:16.59]Yeah.
[259:17.27]Are you Ping?
[259:18.23]No.
[259:19.03]There's no Ping.
[259:21.02]You know what this is?
[259:29.38]This is a guy at Comic-Con that is dressing up like Colossus.
[259:34.26]And he is not big enough, and he is not strong enough, and he's like 5'3".
[259:39.52]You know, Colossus is his favorite character, but he probably shouldn't have picked Colossus.
[259:44.11]Probably should have picked Cyclops.
[259:45.77]They both have the same amount of letters.
[259:46.83]They both have C's in the name.
[259:53.96]What?
[259:55.32]Okay.
[260:00.22]I could have stopped him a few times there.
[260:02.00]We had a very good view this whole time.
[260:17.57]Is this the biggest congregation of people?
[260:20.58]Get out of the way!
[260:23.27]Somebody's chasing after me now.
[260:27.21]Alright, if you were watching as a bystander, who's the bad guy here?
[260:31.21]Definitely not him.
[260:33.70]I'm the bad guy in this situation.
[260:34.98]You're going to die right here!
[260:55.73]Come here.
[260:59.93]Don't you think... You're not gonna fucking beat me, man.
[261:01.79]I'm sorry.
[261:02.15]It's not gonna happen.
[261:03.75]So, you can either cut the shit, or I can kill you with an environmental kill.
[261:09.98]Oh, goddammit.
[261:10.66]I tried to... He's dead.
[261:12.18]Give me the purse.
[261:14.74]The bag.
[261:15.20]Open up the cache.
[261:20.34]Mr. Lethal.
[261:27.40]It's alright, I made of complete and total steel and a little bit of alloy.
[261:31.19]I am perfectly fine.
[261:32.57]I'm using this guy's car as cover.
[261:44.53]Did you get the bug?
[261:47.90]I got it.
[261:48.28]Our surveillance team reports that you should be able to get onto the roof from the construction site.
[261:51.70]The roof?
[261:52.62]Whatever you do, don't let them see you planting that bug.
[261:55.18]No shit.
[261:59.41]Wait a minute.
[262:01.63]Wait a minute.
[262:04.81]I was trying to punch through the glass.
[262:16.40]What was that movie with the guy that was like the bronze?
[262:21.12]He was a robot.
[262:23.66]What the hell was it?
[262:24.56]It was like 15 years ago.
[262:32.71]Not C-3PO.
[262:38.57]No, I need to see what it is.
[262:40.21]What is it called?
[262:44.92]Robot.
[262:48.94]I think Robin Williams was in it.
[262:51.92]Yes, there it is.
[262:52.68]The Bicentennial Man.
[262:54.26]Okay, that's who we are.
[262:58.84]We're the Bicentennial Man.
[263:04.09]I'm going to put this picture on screen.
[263:14.63]I get it on the desktop.
[263:18.30]I know I've seen this movie, but I don't remember anything that happens in it.
[263:21.26]All I remember is this is what he looked like.
[263:26.78]Where is he?
[263:30.06]There he is.
[263:35.98]It's uncanny.
[263:41.34]Fucking Bicentennial Man.
[263:46.69]Has anybody ever seen that movie?
[263:47.91]I feel like maybe you guys... Are you guys too young for that movie?
[263:59.94]It's a good movie, right?
[264:05.17]I don't know any of the plot points of that movie.
[264:07.31]None.
[264:09.11]Not one plot point.
[264:13.22]Fuck.
[264:16.20]Hold on a minute.
[264:20.92]I need to... I don't know anything about the movie.
[264:22.54]I want to watch the trailer.
[264:25.60]Bicentennial Man trailer.
[264:34.08]Okay, let's try it.
[264:40.07]It's AI, I mean, is it AI?
[264:46.13]Browser source.
[264:51.29]Okay, here's the trailer for Bicentennial, man.
[264:55.69]Everybody downstairs.
[264:57.47]Come on, you guys.
[264:57.97]I've got a surprise for you.
[264:59.55]Okay, from the director of Mrs. Doubtfire.
[265:01.98]What is it, Daddy?
[265:06.26]Be your own boss.
[265:12.42]Okay, let's keep playing.
[265:14.16]By the year 2005... Are you one's family?
[265:18.54]I guess so.
[265:19.42]...every home will have an NDR 114.
[265:23.22]That was very good.
[265:24.96]Thank you, sir.
[265:25.86]I think it sucks.
[265:27.38]Sucks?
[265:28.12]Chickens do not have lips.
[265:30.32]He was designed to serve humans.
[265:32.63]Would you please open the window?

[266:30.08]This is a long trailer.
[266:57.18]I saw the inner me between man and machine kiss me
[267:13.29]This is the whole movie.
[267:14.81]Wait, I didn't catch any of this.
[267:16.27]Why is he a person?
[267:17.80]I didn't catch any of that.
[267:20.70]Why was he a guy?
[267:21.50]I don't understand why he was a guy.
[267:23.08]He was a robot, right?
[267:48.07]That's one of your favorite movies as a child?
[267:52.59]He wanted to become hu- Oh, that's right!
[267:54.43]That's right, it was about an AI that wanted to become human.
[267:56.97]Okay.
[268:07.58]I'm gonna do this part.
[268:12.51]He's took- he took the- somebody's skin?
[268:16.81]An AI?
[268:17.35]That's a robot.
[268:17.93]A robot is AI.
[268:20.33]Let's get something better.
[268:26.07]A robot is artificial intelligence.
[268:30.88]Any new unlockables?
[268:32.48]Let's get the police bike again.
[268:33.68]I like the police bike.
[268:41.40]The bicentennial dickhead.
[268:49.28]This is different.
[268:52.18]Where's this taking me?
[268:54.79]That seems very far away from here.
[269:12.98]All leads back there nice loop Zoom out
[269:38.75]Huh?
[269:39.19]I have to use... I gotta go to my house.
[269:43.66]No, I have to go here.
[269:45.32]Here.
[269:46.38]Yes.
[269:46.96]Okay.
[269:48.04]That's better.
[270:06.84]Come on, fuck you.
[270:09.10]I'm trying to do something cool here.
[270:19.97]Swim, you coward.
[270:21.33]I'm not gonna swim.
[270:29.43]Hit the garbage can?
[270:32.76]I can do that.
[270:37.03]This one right here?
[270:40.03]No, I need a better target than that.
[270:47.03]What?
[270:47.89]Oh.
[270:51.04]What was that song?
[270:51.70]Is the song still playing?
[270:56.06]Got it.
[271:05.23]Bicentennial Man is not gonna sink in that water.
[271:08.16]It's spray paint.
[271:09.04]Not that big of a deal.
[271:16.06]Let's take a look at Surveillance.
[271:38.73]You should fear me!
[271:44.75]Lady still out here?
[271:47.11]No.
[271:47.59]She learned her lesson.
[271:52.86]Take a few pictures.
[271:53.54]Come on.
[272:04.43]What's going on here?
[272:09.25]What's going on here?
[272:12.41]What's going on here?
[272:17.04]I think I'm gonna be puked.
[272:25.50]You're in a mission.
[272:26.72]No.
[272:34.87]I just Goomba stomped that guy.
[272:37.94]I guess I have to do this.
[272:42.46]That was... angry.
[272:42.96]Fuck outta here.
[273:04.55]Wii U!
[273:13.40]Got one.
[273:16.12]Extra points.
[273:24.95]Whoa.
[273:25.51]Alright.
[273:27.37]Climb the construction to access the thing.
[273:29.95]You got it.
[273:30.72]Okay.
[273:39.78]I did not think I was going to be able to get that.
[273:41.98]Wait, don't rush this.
[273:43.38]There's probably cases.
[273:50.63]Right.
[273:51.05]You have to imagine.
[273:52.61]There's something right there.
[273:57.13]There's a case.
[274:04.71]Got some vintage... I got a jumpsuit.
[274:07.09]Cool.
[274:07.21]Cool.
[274:10.85]I think I found a way in.
[274:12.15]Statue.
[274:13.53]Come on, the goddamn bison telling a man.
[274:18.24]Okay, where's that statue?
[274:39.05]And a bug in the AC vent.
[274:42.80]Oh, fuck.
[274:43.24]Are these guys going to be mad at me?
[274:49.64]I'm... I don't... Okay.
[274:51.84]Is this a stealth mission?
[274:55.04]Apparently it is.
[275:00.73]How do I sneak?
[275:02.51]Is there a sneak in this game?
[275:03.65]I don't think there's a sneak.
[275:06.38]There's no sneak.
[275:06.96]Um.
[275:07.06]Oh.
[275:07.20]Okay.
[275:39.60]What does this want me to do?
[275:43.94]Oh.
[275:45.48]Blind?
[275:46.36]I... How would I be blind?
[275:55.07]It put me in the place and it's like, oh, sneak around!
[276:09.62]Fucking Bicentennial, man.
[276:14.06]That's it, right?
[276:22.94]What?
[276:24.26]What?
[276:27.44]No, I just did it!
[276:47.41]It just said it was complete.
[276:54.01]Bug calibrated.
[276:54.87]Okay.
[277:00.45]Alright.
[277:01.73]Pick the lock on the back door.
[277:03.07]Oh my god.
[277:24.17]You stupid motherfucker.
[277:31.17]Let's go.
[277:37.08]I did it.
[277:41.24]Why does this lock... I don't know.
[277:42.22]Why would that lock from the inside?
[277:44.24]From the outside?
[277:47.00]Such a bad cop.
[277:47.86]Alright, I got another...
[277:53.37]One of those things.
[277:54.19]Whatever they're called.
[277:55.59]Zero points.
[277:56.35]Great.
[278:01.66]Hold on.
[278:02.08]Stay there.
[278:02.36]I won't do that.
[278:05.30]Your security skill has improved.
[278:06.70]I don't even... That's the first time I've ever done it in the whole game.
[278:10.14]Just get a fucking bike.
[278:17.68]Where the fuck am I?
[278:22.04]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[278:28.91]Whatever.
[278:32.03]Ooh, that hurts!
[278:32.71]Don't get arrested ever again.
[278:33.73]That was a nice car that I just lost.
[278:41.39]Some roast duck stuff.
[278:45.55]I'm gonna go turn in this jade statue.
[279:02.68]Why would I commit a crime like this immediately?
[279:07.96]Turn the statue in.
[279:12.43]Not a pork butt.
[279:13.29]No, it wasn't a pork butt.
[279:14.27]I don't like pork.
[279:17.43]If I had the choice between a roast duck and a pork butt... I'm not going to eat those.
[279:21.35]I'm eating the fucking roast duck.
[279:24.37]I'm a poultry man.
[279:31.51]Classical music?
[279:35.46]Let's find that.
[279:37.08]Real FM.
[279:39.61]Roadrunners.
[279:40.17]Ninja Toon.
[279:45.13]Sounds kind of classical to me.
[279:49.18]I found one of your statues.
[279:51.74]The dog.
[279:53.12]Excellent.
[279:53.88]Did you enjoy your time in the States?
[279:56.22]It was alright.
[279:56.80]Duck is chewy steak.
[279:57.64]To have two homes is to have two souls.
[279:59.76]It's cooked improperly.
[280:01.12]I don't ever feel at home anywhere.
[280:03.51]Then I think you must guard your soul carefully so as not to lose it.
[280:11.81]What would you like to learn?
[280:13.29]Alright, we got a follow-up strike on stunned opponents.
[280:21.60]Let's get this.
[280:22.08]I want to get the whirlwind kick here next time.
[280:24.30]So how does this work here?
[280:26.78]So stun strike.
[280:28.63]Practice the stun strike follow-up.
[280:29.93]That's cool.
[280:36.07]Okay.
[280:37.29]So I wonder if they're stunned.
[280:39.49]Okay, so even if you stun them, that'll happen.
[280:44.79]I can do that to...
[280:47.09]I have a combo here, so... Alright, that's cool.
[280:50.35]Just a continuation of the last one.
[280:51.67]Good work.
[280:52.77]I think I'm gonna be using that move every time.
[281:02.40]It's too good.
[281:18.20]Who's left?
[281:20.83]You?
[281:22.33]It's a kick to the balls.
[281:24.91]I mean, not necessarily.
[281:28.45]It's a knee.
[281:30.02]It's a knee.
[281:30.64]Alright, let's do this.
[281:33.82]Here's what's gonna happen.
[281:35.00]Ladies and gentlemen.
[281:38.13]Ladies and gentlemen.
[281:39.11]This is what's gonna happen here.
[281:42.53]I am going to... We're going to do this next case.
[281:46.75]We're going to, like, get this one started.
[281:50.15]See where we're at.
[281:50.82]And then I'm going to... See you tomorrow!
[281:55.10]Once we get to, like, the five... Plus five or six hour mark.
[281:58.46]We're going to be playing this tomorrow, too.
[281:59.78]Because I'm interested.
[282:05.77]This game's a lot of fun.
[282:07.19]I'm having a good time with this game.
[282:08.61]It's very, very interesting.
[282:14.96]What if there is no tomorrow?
[282:16.16]What do you mean if there's no tomorrow?
[282:24.83]Graceful.
[282:28.63]I could have just walked up the stairs, you know.
[282:33.77]Inspector.
[282:34.27]Away.
[282:35.09]I'm glad you're here.
[282:36.65]What do you know about the underground racing circuit?
[282:38.85]Well, they drive fast.
[282:40.05]Occasionally they crash into something.
[282:41.59]Yeah, and occasionally they end up killing each other.
[282:43.47]Well, that's manslaughter at best.
[282:45.61]But these last couple of files don't feel like manslaughter to me.
[282:48.71]We'll continue this tomorrow.
[282:51.27]Friday might be something a little different.
[282:55.46]We might try to do something Friday.
[283:00.16]If I can get it prepared by Friday, I'll try it.
[283:02.26]Every time I come up with a cutscene, I have to replug in my controller.
[283:17.88]Jackie, who should I call about racing?
[283:19.26]Ace, he's a friend of a friend.
[283:26.49]Big race head.
[283:27.27]I'll let him know you'll call.
[283:30.95]Call Ace.
[283:31.37]I love how there's only one contact every time I open the phone.
[283:37.11]I still have not seen a gun the whole game.
[283:41.54]Is that like by design?
[283:53.78]What are these guys all doing?
[283:59.50]You're giving me a perfect opportunity to do a skee-ball here.
[284:03.47]They're all sitting.
[284:18.92]Got it.
[284:24.99]Found frisky blockers.
[284:28.45]I had one, then lost it.
[284:29.57]Yeah, I don't... I've never even seen it.
[284:36.76]That one guy doesn't even care.
[284:37.82]Cool.
[284:38.38]Got the case.
[284:47.96]I gotta go in this car, apparently.
[284:49.16]Did I have none?
[284:49.60]Have I not smoked this one?
[284:51.25]I have, haven't I?
[284:53.01]Yeah, I have.
[284:56.43]Guns are not easy to come by and they're just as hard to keep.
[285:00.30]That's fun.
[285:00.88]I'd rather it be more about the combat, the melee combat.
[285:03.98]It's more fun that way.
[285:08.49]Let's get like a new channel on here.
[285:12.25]Ninja tune.
[285:14.93]Made it.
[285:15.29]Are we gonna do a hydraulics competition?
[285:40.44]Oh, this is a race, oh no.
[285:41.87]I'm so bad at races, it's not even funny.
[285:48.99]And no, guys, didn't hit the girl.
[285:50.99]It's gonna just be like a GTA race, somebody's gonna crash and it's gonna ruin everything.
[286:08.48]Narrow corridors.
[286:22.64]I gotta get by.
[286:23.40]Sneak by.
[286:24.32]Use the boost.
[286:28.83]See?
[286:29.57]Some dickhead's always gonna... I thought I was supposed to be arresting these people, not competing against them.
[286:43.04]And look, it's fine.
[286:43.54]If I get in fourth place, I will still make it.
[286:51.06]I was gonna make a Mario Kart reference, and then I... I lost.
[286:59.26]Just go faster!
[287:00.44]I'm holding the trigger down!
[287:08.56]Should've went that way.
[287:16.10]Pass on the inside.
[287:17.02]Pass on the inside.
[287:33.12]Almost there.
[287:34.46]There's a big, sharp turn right here.
[287:36.02]Don't blow it.
[287:45.05]Don't get past.
[287:45.97]It's pretty straight.
[287:56.01]Last leg, here it is.
[288:10.35]I win!

[290:58.30]You know, they would guard in their suitcase.
[291:02.64]All the car vendors have different cars?
[291:04.26]That's cool.
[291:06.16]I think this is a bike race.
[291:08.18]Let's do the bike race.
[291:15.16]Motorcycle, great handling, loud... Oh, no.
[291:19.06]I thought it was a bike race.
[291:21.30]It is a bike race.
[291:22.00]Okay.
[291:23.78]Let's do it.
[291:28.31]I didn't even hit that lady, and you all know it.
[291:33.46]I have an itchy nose.
[291:34.87]Itchy nose.
[291:41.15]Why am I standing in such an awful place?
[291:45.73]My bike sucks again.
[291:46.67]I'm on a stupid police bike.
[291:47.93]Aye!
[291:55.18]Aye!
[291:58.50]I'm still fine.
[292:15.55]I'm losing control.
[292:18.23]I wonder if this guy's a cop.
[292:22.79]Nah man, I just stole him.
[292:31.63]What happened to those two?
[292:34.02]Did you see the guys on the left that went up?
[292:37.80]Watch out, don't hit the lady!
[292:43.16]Two guys went up on the left ramp and they like flew off their bikes.
[292:56.23]I can't even attack.
[293:01.33]You know, I can't even protect an auto attack.
[293:04.76]What happened?
[293:10.26]Fucking Xbox controller.
[293:11.50]It's still possible.
[293:30.95]I wish they'd get these flares off the road.
[293:32.53]They're so huge.
[293:34.49]Dial it down.
[293:45.35]I'm catching up.
[293:47.79]It's not that big of a deal.
[293:52.14]Here we are.
[293:53.38]Only 17% complete.
[293:54.24]I've got plenty of time to get up here.
[294:02.21]Past Toad.
[294:05.37]Fuck you, Toad.
[294:05.98]And then here is Koopa Troopa in front of him.
[294:10.10]Back in the line.
[294:24.38]Not the last place in England.
[294:29.41]Secret.
[294:38.89]This is so twisty, Kearney.
[294:48.55]Progress.
[294:50.19]Big, big turn up here.
[294:51.73]Left-handed turn.
[294:52.33]I'm gonna have to start drifting, like, right now.
[294:58.79]Fuck!
[295:00.37]It's fine.
[295:22.20]I swear to God, if I crashed into that guy, you would have heard me yell very loudly.
[295:28.37]They got... Oh...
[295:41.86]Fuck you, your bike is faster than me.
[296:05.14]Still in second.
[296:06.60]I have to pass this guy now.
[296:15.41]Little corner here.
[296:18.46]Right turn.
[296:19.90]Past him.
[296:21.34]No, I didn't.
[296:23.36]Arrest him?
[296:28.48]I can't.
[296:28.96]I would have already done that by now.
[296:38.16]I need to ram him off the road.
[296:39.87]He needs to go flying into the ocean.
[296:52.09]Right here.
[296:54.13]This is the spot.
[296:55.09]Almost there.
[296:55.65]And we're both so far away from everybody.
[297:00.63]Excuse me.
[297:08.91]Excuse me.
[297:09.65]Excuse me.
[297:10.18]Did it work?
[297:12.10]No, it didn't fucking work.
[297:18.08]Mmmmm.
[297:22.33]OHH!
[297:28.50]Stay away from me.
[297:55.20]That was right there too, fuck.
[298:04.32]That's the sound you make when you actually get in a real car accident.
[298:08.53]That was, I fucking had it too, even after fucking up.
[298:15.99]That's so painful, oh well.
[298:22.47]I hated that race when I played it.
[298:25.43]I've had it there too.
[298:26.63]It was so easy.
[298:27.87]I just had to not crash the fucking car.
[298:31.55]Whatever.
[298:32.03]Just do me the next mission.
[298:33.47]I'm so tilted right now.
[298:41.61]I'm tilted right now.
[298:45.61]I am on full Bicentennial tilt.
[298:54.41]No, no, no race.
[298:55.59]Let's just do the actual mission.
[299:03.22]He's got a knife in my back.
[299:07.06]Fuck you, dude.
[299:09.66]Eliminate the thugs.
[299:34.61]Hey, the important thing is he tried, right?
[300:12.63]Alright, I want to do a move to you.
[300:16.07]Fuck off.
[300:19.93]Right in the nuts.
[300:33.50]I'm going to be so dehydrated.
[300:34.84]I think I...
[300:41.91]Ah!
[300:42.81]It's like painful.
[300:43.75]When I open my mouth, the creases on my lips crack and they hurt and like, ow!
[300:49.55]It's so fucking dry.
[300:50.65]I forgot to do this.
[301:07.25]Here we go.
[301:09.57]Another one of these.
[301:12.50]zero one two three bingo two three uh seven eight seven oh my god excuse me everyone oh yeah idiot streamers this guy can't even do it
[301:40.37]I have a car.
[301:41.67]I have a nice motorcycle that I threw over here.
[302:03.69]Just trying to scare him.
[302:08.36]Just go inside and ask... What did you say?
[302:10.32]Why can I not get in here?
[302:21.55]I thought that guy had his... That guy had his penis out.
[302:24.69]I honestly thought that's what that was.
[302:26.61]Lower right.
[302:27.23]No, he just has a gremlin in his front pocket.
[302:30.25]I was about to say this is... I'm going to get in trouble for this one.
[302:34.35]I think I broke it.
[302:41.60]Alright.
[302:42.04]Chain of evidence.
[302:42.96]Let's go.
[302:49.28]Beautiful.
[302:49.52]That was beauty.
[302:52.08]What's this?
[302:52.42]Music?
[302:58.36]Music.
[303:02.76]Club?
[303:03.36]What is this?
[303:04.80]What is this?
[303:07.34]I want to get in there.
[303:08.02]I want to do the music.
[303:14.06]You're not going to allow me in there?
[303:17.42]Where's the club?
[303:19.42]It should be right here.
[303:25.05]It's right there.
[303:25.63]Why is it closed?
[303:26.67]Why is it latched up like this?
[303:31.31]You're not going to keep the Bicentennial Man out of there.
[303:34.57]Other side of the street.
[303:38.09]It isn't.
[303:58.59]Not that side.
[304:01.62]Other side of the street.
[304:04.94]He's talking about around here.
[304:06.10]Well, you should have said on the... Behind.
[304:09.57]Behind your street.
[304:12.77]Behind the street.
[304:23.64]No, I'm in big trouble.
[304:24.88]I really need your help, please.
[304:26.38]What's wrong?
[304:27.42]It's... It's this.
[304:30.52]A gun?
[304:31.26]Yes.
[304:32.26]Charlie made me carry it in my purse for him.
[304:34.09]He didn't want the cops to find it, so he made me take it.
[304:37.51]And now he's gone, and I don't know what to do with it.
[304:39.73]Charlie, he's worn a dog eye.
[304:41.41]I pointed at her.
[304:42.49]Yes, and you took over, right?
[304:44.85]So in a way, the gun is yours, too.
[304:47.27]You'll take it, won't you?
[304:51.96]I would laugh so hard if she backed up and she had gold spray paint all over her face and chest and arms and shit.
[305:06.73]It's a detail.
[305:09.71]Okay, so now I have a gun.
[305:11.93]How do I use the gun?
[305:14.61]It's not on the phone.
[305:15.31]I don't think I can use the gun.
[305:21.48]L1.
[305:21.62]What?
[305:51.55]It might just be for the cutscene.
[305:54.53]It's probably a story thing, this particular weapon.
[306:09.88]This is going really fast.
[306:17.63]Am I gonna shoot this guy in the car?
[306:18.89]Fire warm-up shots into the debris.
[306:54.58]It's simple.
[306:55.62]What?
[306:56.44]We'll have to recreate the fight.
[306:58.40]What are we doing?
[307:01.45]You think you can rig me up?
[307:05.13]We'll recreate the fight.
[307:06.77]Are we doing detective work now?
[307:09.35]I'm not recreating this.
[307:18.88]Get down behind that barrier.
[307:20.92]This is... Okay.
[307:22.00]I want you to put some bullets in a few things.
[307:30.40]Apparently.
[307:30.94]Shoot blind fire.
[307:39.29]Yeah, here's the van.
[307:43.55]Here's the dude.
[308:00.15]Take cover behind the second barricade.
[308:01.65]Is this a gun tutorial?
[308:03.25]Yeah, this is just the gun tutorial.
[308:06.77]Five hours into the game.
[308:07.69]Oh, that's cool.
[308:08.28]I unlocked that.
[308:39.79]Slow time again.
[308:40.71]You don't seem to aim very well.
[308:47.98]You're in slow time.
[308:49.04]Oh, he went to try to get away.
[308:54.80]Shoot the tires.
[308:55.48]Well, he's already fucking himself.
[308:58.62]Running over his friend.
[308:59.44]Alright.
[309:06.55]Where are you going, Wade?
[309:08.51]I'm shooting out the tires.
[309:16.49]Your weapon, officer.
[309:19.88]Good firing way.
[309:22.90]Pedro!
[309:24.97]That guy was dead.
[309:26.56]That guy was probably dead for like four or five hours by now.
[309:30.46]Why am I getting like Windows... Oh, my fucking controller.
[309:55.58]I got three points with that one.
[310:01.78]That's all I get for three.
[310:05.60]Alright.
[310:07.70]The cops are already here.
[310:10.98]They're above the... Just get out of here.
[310:29.80]Back it up, back up, back up!
[310:31.04]Ah!
[310:31.90]The GTA 5 trick is so great.
[310:34.74]You can get there, you just back up until you're in the grey and then they can't find you.
[310:38.49]Alright, I'm good here.
[310:42.85]Sounds good.
[310:43.43]Just found out that Mrs. Chu's restaurant got hit.
[310:46.01]Fucking texting and reading and driving.
[310:50.80]Where did you come from?
[310:51.56]We just found out that Mrs. Chu's restaurant got hit.
[310:57.47]We've received a tip on Hotshot's whereabouts.
[311:00.93]I parked a truck nearby so you can bug his car and tail him.
[311:03.65]This guy still has a grudge.
[311:14.72]Well, not anymore.
[311:19.56]Alright, so we are going to conclude this for the night.
[311:25.15]What is down there though?
[311:30.93]What is this?
[311:34.03]Can I Dark Souls this guy?
[311:37.18]Apparently there's a bad guy right here.
[311:41.30]I'm gonna do a jumping R1.
[311:42.46]See if I can get whatever it is.
[311:45.28]There's a boat there, too.
[311:46.16]Alright, let's see.
[311:52.57]Oh, I made it, though.
[311:54.19]Boat.
[311:56.79]Oh, man.
[311:57.91]Okay, cool.
[312:00.01]Don't I have the gun?
[312:23.34]Uh, chest.
[312:29.31]I want that.
[312:29.69]There's a chest there.
[312:37.81]This is not a good spot for this.
[312:39.33]It's alright, I want the chest.
[312:44.97]Am I roleplaying as somebody in this video?
[312:46.77]No.
[312:54.70]So easy.
[312:56.52]I love how a video game character's just... water instantly kills them.
[313:01.33]You die if you touch water.
[313:02.35]See?
[313:05.73]Dead.
[313:07.95]Like I died from shock.
[313:11.94]I gotta hack this?
[313:14.94]Turn the lock clockwise.
[313:18.02]What am I doing here?
[313:26.53]Oh, I see.
[313:33.13]Just a padlock.
[313:46.16]It's the first time I've had to do that.
[313:47.54]There's a gun in there.
[313:52.23]Oh, nice.
[313:52.77]A gun.
[313:52.91]Alright, I don't want to lose the gun.
[313:58.46]Let's take this boat, though.
[313:59.52]I want to go to the boat.
[314:03.39]What's the temperature like in Hong Kong?
[314:06.89]Is Hong Kong warm, cold, hot?
[314:10.13]What's it like?
[314:10.59]I've never been.
[314:14.05]There is treasure over there.
[314:15.63]We're absolutely going to go check that out.
[314:23.54]This boat is almost impossible to drive through.
[314:28.85]I'm trying to stop it.
[314:30.27]And I'm trying to turn.
[314:40.81]I can't turn left.
[314:44.68]Turn left.
[314:55.67]Interesting.
[315:01.50]There we go.
[315:06.46]This is so hard to drive, this.
[315:09.30]Oh my god, this is awful.
[315:10.34]I want what was in there!
[315:11.43]I want that- where was that?
[315:12.61]Back here?
[315:13.03]I started drifting in the water.
[315:16.65]It's right there.
[315:22.20]I'm better off swimming.
[315:26.22]And then we're gonna drive to the island and then the stream's over.
[315:32.50]This is fine.
[315:37.70]That's 50 grand.
[315:45.06]All those red envelopes have $50,000 in them.
[315:51.93]Beautiful.
[315:52.33]Alright, let's take this thing to the island.
[316:03.58]I'm gonna drive into the sunset.
[316:06.56]It's magic!
[316:08.96]You know!
[316:11.26]Oh, what a soundtrack.
[316:16.84]It's magic!
[316:20.14]No other sound effects but Queen in the background.
[316:37.75]There's stuff here.
[316:39.35]What is this?
[316:42.91]Random island.
[316:52.02]Wait, is this the Sorting Hat?
[316:53.22]Okay.
[317:06.99]Am I going here?
[317:10.34]Lots of blood here.
[317:12.92]This is a DLC island, okay.
[317:18.16]So should I just get out of here?
[317:21.28]Am I going to find the dinosaur in Jurassic Park?
[317:26.20]I feel like I shouldn't even be here.
[317:29.82]Yeah, I don't want to see it.
[317:34.13]Alright.
[317:36.18]We'll continue this tomorrow.
[317:39.98]Thanks, everybody, for sticking around.
[317:41.02]We have to activate it.
[317:47.02]I assumed as much.
[317:48.73]But we can do the credits and the bits.
[317:51.89]More sleeping dogs tomorrow.
[317:56.25]But let me just get back to land.
[317:57.81]This game auto-saves everything, right?
[318:00.02]Yeah.
[318:02.43]Let's just ride off into the distance.
[318:04.05]Should I go to the Homer Simpson power plant thing over there or no?
[318:07.26]No.
[318:11.90]Go sleep on the bike bed.
[318:16.69]That is the invisible wall.
[318:20.61]Yeah, I'll save it.
[318:21.15]Don't worry.
[318:32.53]Save.
[318:32.81]No, I'm going to go sleep in the bed.
[318:33.89]Don't worry.
[318:34.95]I'll get it saved.
[318:37.19]Drive to Japan.
[318:41.65]I'm trying as hard as I can to turn the boat.
[318:50.72]Oh, that's probably not a good idea.
[318:52.06]That's probably stupid.
[318:56.44]I'm fine.
[318:59.10]Can I climb the wall here?
[319:01.72]Come on.
[319:03.00]Ah.
[319:05.18]Shit.
[319:05.54]I gotta go to the damn dock.
[319:09.65]Can I drown myself or something?
[319:14.63]Yeah.
[319:14.99]Good night.
[319:15.27]If you've taken off, thanks for sticking around.
[319:18.89]See you tomorrow.
[319:20.71]Same time, same place.
[319:32.15]Take the yacht?
[319:32.91]Yeah, I got it.
[319:34.99]I needed to get some... I don't even know.
[319:39.07]I could have just swam.
[319:40.62]What was the point of that?
[319:44.58]Alright.
[319:45.62]Save it.
[319:53.06]Need to find myself a land boat.
[320:02.23]Why am I made out of metal?
[320:05.25]That is a good question.
[320:06.01]God fucking dammit.
[320:12.24]Where's the sticky suit that I can climb walls with?
[320:21.62]I am just not in the right place.
[320:24.09]I have to go over here.
[320:37.25]You can get a grapple hook?
[320:40.16]That sounds kind of insane.
[320:41.18]I'll have to look into that.
[320:50.52]Jump over it.
[320:53.23]Ugh!
[320:58.25]I want to just, like, I'm going to attack this police officer so a cruiser comes over here.
[321:10.66]Alright, car.
[321:13.12]What's with the empty streets?
[321:16.14]Thank you.
[321:19.68]Let's go back to the safe house.
[321:20.82]That's a nice car.
[321:23.22]Alright, we are gonna go back here.
[321:29.31]Oh, that's far away.
[321:32.77]Well, where is my house?
[321:36.83]It's like here, right?
[321:42.27]Where is my house?
[321:45.75]Club Bam Bam.
[321:50.55]I mean, am I just a fucking brainless imbecile and I just don't know where the house is?
[321:54.97]Where's my house?
[321:55.87]I thought it was like right here somewhere.
[322:08.20]Where is it?
[322:23.74]Is it the blue house?
[322:25.78]That's cop job.
[322:27.74]Vehicle store.
[322:28.38]Alright, it's gray.
[322:33.67]It's the gray house.
[322:39.41]Or it's just the house.
[322:44.49]Where is it?
[322:48.77]Why did it go away?
[322:51.55]Safe house and apartment.
[322:55.75]It kind of looks like a t-shirt though.
[323:00.13]Where the fuck is the house?
[323:04.68]Where's the grayed out house marker?
[323:07.72]There it is.
[323:10.64]No, it's not.
[323:11.56]Yes, it is.
[323:11.98]There it is.
[323:12.48]There's the house.
[323:13.12]There it is.
[323:20.23]It wasn't even gray.
[323:20.85]It was blue.
[323:30.02]It was blue.
[323:31.10]That wasn't gray.
[323:31.92]That was blue.
[323:32.58]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[323:40.34]Oh, I can do that.
[323:43.24]That's kind of cool.
[323:49.03]Oh, come on.
[323:49.45]Give me a break.
[323:50.01]There's like a thousand documents on the screen.
[323:52.45]There were too many documents on the screen.
[324:10.43]And I was looking for gray, not looking for light blue.
[324:12.63]It's because I'm on a mission currently.
[324:15.53]To look at the surveillance stuff.
[324:17.39]That's why it looks like that.
[324:18.33]I'm sitting there looking for a gray house.
[324:41.40]I was just checking to see if there was a rob button.
[324:46.62]You know what I mean?
[324:52.77]I feel like I killed that guy.
[324:53.59]I'm gonna lose.
[325:10.78]Alright, time to sleep.
[325:13.18]Use the bed.
[325:21.43]Nobody sleeps like that.
[325:24.49]I'm a cop.
[325:24.95]What do you mean?
[325:25.45]Rob button?
[325:26.15]I don't know.
[325:32.62]So there it is.
[325:33.06]Alright.
[325:33.84]Slept.
[325:34.82]We're good.
[325:38.48]Close that.
[325:39.08]Okay.
[325:41.35]Thanks everyone for sticking around.
[325:42.21]I'm going to do the bits and the credits.
[325:48.95]As always, much love.
[325:50.05]Thanks for sticking around.
[325:51.05]Thanks for sticking around.
[325:51.59]Thanks for sticking around.

[328:31.74]Thank you.
[328:34.06]Thank you.
[328:36.48]Thanks a lot, guys.
[328:38.74]Thank you for all of your subscriptions, all your resubs.
[328:41.33]You guys are great.
[328:45.21]I'm gonna... Maybe two of those are correct.
[328:47.83]That's not true.
[328:50.49]Not true.
[328:52.41]I refuse to believe that.
[328:55.94]But you guys are great.
[328:58.04]Do it in a second try.
[328:59.56]No second tries.
[329:02.04]Let's get with the bits, huh?
[329:06.26]Let's go back.
[329:09.20]Earlier tonight.
[329:13.03]Hey, bro luck, thanks for the 250.
[329:14.31]You can't exterminate already dead animals.
[329:18.79]Well... I mean... That's not necessarily true.
[329:22.63]What's wrong with my outro?
[329:24.13]There it is.
[329:26.03]I mean, you can exterminate.
[329:27.43]An exterminator removes animals.
[329:30.25]Carcasses...
[329:32.20]Finds the problem, patches it up, fixes it.
[329:34.84]Exterminator doesn't mean the guy that comes in to exterminate an animal.
[329:40.47]Who else are you supposed to call?
[329:44.19]If there is a dead animal in your wall, what are you going to call the police?
[329:47.67]You're going to call the fire department?
[329:52.72]You're not going to call a contractor.
[329:54.06]What are you going to call a pipe fitter to come in?
[329:56.08]You're going to call a plumber?
[330:00.93]What are you supposed to do?
[330:01.93]You call the exterminator.
[330:03.17]That's their job.
[330:03.93]The pest control.
[330:04.61]That's what it is.
[330:07.07]Animal control is not who you call in that scenario.
[330:10.69]Because animal control is about... That's if you look at... Animal control is who you call if you were to walk outside of your door and go get an ice cream and there was a bear in line.
[330:24.29]That's... You call animal control.
[330:26.19]If you were to go to like your driver's ed class...
[330:30.24]And a tiger was in the road?
[330:32.16]Yeah.
[330:32.92]Animal control.
[330:40.54]You'd call the cops.
[330:41.66]Yeah, but the cops would call animal control.
[330:46.50]If there's like a rabid dog running around like, like fucking barking at people, the cops get animal control and like the dog catcher comes down.
[330:58.60]Bears are cute until you see them without any hair.
[331:01.96]I thought bears were, like, the greatest, most majestic, amazing animals until I saw them without hair.
[331:07.18]They look like big, weird... Droopy the dogs.
[331:14.37]But anyways, thanks, dude.
[331:15.17]Thank you, Pin, for the 25 cents.
[331:16.53]Explain Ant AI.
[331:20.43]It's too late for that.
[331:22.95]Maybe it wasn't too late five hours ago, but it's too late for me.
[331:28.87]They're not supposed to be bald.
[331:30.11]But when they do look... When they're bald, they look like a blood-borne monster.
[331:34.96]We'll go over ant artificial math.
[331:37.12]Ant-R-Math.
[331:38.64]At some point.
[331:39.58]Ants are just math.
[331:41.98]Manboy777, thanks for the 25 cents.
[331:43.92]Dogs don't even sleep.
[331:45.60]It's all a conspiracy made up by Big Canine.
[331:47.98]Open your eyes, sheeple.
[331:49.46]jermaMustard.
[331:52.06]Oh, you're talking about the, uh... You're talking about the... The name of the game.
[331:58.79]Thanks, dude.
[331:59.11]Thank you, Benny Jets, again.
[332:00.77]Earlier, giving $15.
[332:01.95]Where's my wood stream?
[332:04.51]That's coming, don't worry.
[332:05.85]That's just, I'm prepared in case... If I have... If my internet is... Hold on, it's getting a little chilly.
[332:11.43]Give me a sec.
[332:15.23]There we go.
[332:18.46]A Verizon hotspot.
[332:21.08]So, if my internet fucks up, which it does quite frequently...
[332:26.59]I'm just going to turn the hotspot on.
[332:28.47]It's a jetpack.
[332:30.91]Just a Verizon hotspot.
[332:32.21]I'm going to be able to have it.
[332:33.09]I'm going to pay for the plan.
[332:35.01]And then it doesn't matter.
[332:36.61]I can just stream from the hotspot.
[332:41.03]But thanks a lot, man.
[332:41.77]Thank you, Emo.
[332:44.37]For the... Not Emo.
[332:46.21]M4.
[332:47.88]EM4OMag.
[332:50.92]I have no idea what your name is, but thanks for the $1.50.
[332:52.82]Which game are you looking forward to the most?
[332:55.67]M4.
[332:55.91]I'm just going to call you M4.
[332:57.17]It's easy that way.
[332:59.75]At this point, nothing really from this stage here.
[333:03.73]I think 2018.
[333:04.52]I can't really think of anything that's in the pipeline.
[333:10.98]I want to play God of War.
[333:11.84]I heard that game is incredible.
[333:14.56]So, I'm sure I'll be one of those people that plays God of War eventually here.
[333:18.16]I heard it is fantastic.
[333:21.50]I'd like to give it a try.
[333:25.73]Leon the Lion gave $40 earlier.
[333:28.67]Thanks a lot once again, buddy.
[333:30.35]That's a lot of fucking money.
[333:32.71]Connor Rowe, thanks for the $1.
[333:34.13]Is your surname Elbertson or Elbertson?
[333:36.90]E-L.
[333:37.94]E-L-B-E-R-T.
[333:40.12]Elbertson.
[333:42.76]Thank you, Son of Jenova, for the $1.
[333:44.32]Can your walls kill humans too?
[333:46.26]Asking for a friend.
[333:49.09]Yes, if you get trapped in a wall, you're gonna die.
[333:52.79]It doesn't matter if you're a mouse or a 44-year-old grown man.
[333:57.49]If you sneak into somebody's house in their wall, and you have no access to food or water, and you have no way to get out or in, and you're in the wall, you're dead.
[334:08.27]I mean, that's not even true.
[334:10.14]You could probably bang.
[334:10.90]No, at that point, if you were that big, if you were a big grown man, you could just start smashing into the wall, and eventually people would know you're in there.
[334:20.17]You could probably break in if you were in the drywall.
[334:26.41]But at that point, what are you doing there in the first place?
[334:30.24]Can you imagine somebody just starts like, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[334:33.54]And you're like, what the fuck, is something in the wall?
[334:35.54]And this guy in a tank top breaks out of your wall and starts punching through and looks through the hall.
[334:40.52]You gotta get me out of here.
[334:43.28]What is he doing in there?
[334:43.96]He's like, I don't understand what I'm doing in here.
[334:46.62]I was, you don't have an answer.
[334:50.54]What about the people under the stairs?
[334:52.82]You can fit under the stairs, though.
[334:54.22]If you have a closet under the stairs, you could go in there with a bowl of soup and live for a couple days.
[335:02.25]Thank you.
[335:02.55]Thank you to The Ninja Muffins for the $1.50.
[335:05.03]Thanks a lot, dude.
[335:07.22]Trump W is DansGame.
[335:08.86]Thanks for the 50 cents.
[335:09.80]They say cheer 50.
[335:10.62]Thank you.
[335:13.17]Dunkey arisen thanks to the $1.45 mediocre streamer leads a colony of ants up to his urethra.
[335:18.67]Okay.
[335:19.31]Bye.
[335:20.05]Thanks for the $1.45 max Max Shep $1 not doing very much vetting on these because I'm really tired and hungry Max G Shep.
[335:29.08]Thanks for the $1 wee boo game Why What That
[335:40.94]Thank you, Bitslay, for the 25 cents.
[335:43.30]I'm scheduled to take the DLAB on Wednesday.
[335:46.22]Wish me luck.
[335:46.94]Passing score is a 110.
[335:48.93]It's supposedly one of the hardest tests you can take.
[335:55.31]Um... Wait, you need a 110 to pass?
[336:00.55]Isn't that 10 points higher than a 100%?
[336:02.86]Or is it scored differently?
[336:06.12]That seems very high.
[336:09.49]But good luck to you, dude.
[336:10.29]Hopefully you get more than $110.
[336:15.33]Werewed40, thanks for the $1.
[336:17.91]I don't know what they say here.
[336:18.97]They just say PJ Salt.
[336:20.83]But thanks a lot, dude.
[336:21.71]Thanks for the $1.
[336:23.33]Calm Slime, thanks for the $1.
[336:24.59]Not like this.
[336:25.17]Oof.
[336:27.29]Am I pronouncing that right?
[336:28.07]Is it oof or is it like ooh?
[336:31.77]Let's find out.
[336:37.27]Let's see.
[336:41.83]Wow, I was way off.
[336:45.43]I did not think that's what I... I thought it was gonna be like this.
[336:55.89]Every time I've ever seen that, I feel like it sounds... That's like a very loud, like, oh, I just died!
[337:02.92]I... There's two ways that I've seen this, and I don't know anything about fucking memes.
[337:06.46]So this is the first way that I saw it.
[337:08.72]Was... Hold on, let me record it.
[337:17.48]Oof.
[337:51.66]Oh shit, that's what I thought it was.
[337:55.35]I forgot to unmute.
[337:56.67]I didn't think it was that high pitched.
[338:00.15]Or I thought it was like this.
[338:07.59]And this way, this second potential way, I thought it was like, it's supposed to be like, ooh, fuck.
[338:12.87]You know what I'm saying?
[338:15.12]Like this.
[338:17.72]Ooh.
[338:21.75]I didn't think it was... Let me listen to that one more time.
[338:32.59]Okay.
[338:36.46]Yeah, I was not correct.
[338:37.86]That's fine.
[338:39.96]Thanks a lot for the... I don't know.
[338:47.88]Oh, it was ComSlam.
[338:48.62]Thanks for the $1.00.
[338:51.55]uh cadet thanks for the cadet 82 thanks for the 10 bucks I remember trading with you way back in the day on TF2 insane to see the growth you've had over the years cheers mate thanks dude what did we trade was it worth it did I did I lose out or did you lose out who got the better deal
[339:14.02]That sounds like Terraria.
[339:15.62]Hold on.
[339:16.16]Hold on.
[339:18.16]Terraria hit sound.
[339:22.18]What is it called?
[339:22.78]What is it?
[339:41.96]Why is it like... What were we just saying?
[339:51.85]Oh, TF2 trading.
[339:55.25]Thank you.
[339:56.73]Hopefully you got a good deal.
[339:58.99]And thanks for the $10, dude.
[340:00.27]Appreciate it.
[340:01.67]Wild Buddy.
[340:02.85]Thanks for the $0.25.
[340:03.85]Just imagine seeing a police chase and the guy just stops mid-chase.
[340:08.29]Why'd he stop running?
[340:09.19]Oh, his controller turned off.
[340:12.71]Thank you, Monty the Moose, for the 50 cents.
[340:14.29]Don't live in a house, you say.
[340:15.43]I think I'll simplify that and just not live.
[340:19.42]No, just don't live in a house.
[340:22.76]Let's rephrase this.
[340:24.60]Live in a house if... And this is a very, very important if and but.
[340:30.91]If you have a family...
[340:33.37]If you have a girlfriend, or you have a wife, and that wife gets pregnant, and then you have a child, and then you maybe have another child, and you're a family unit, then a house, can I interest you in a house?
[340:47.24]Don't buy a house if you're not a family unit.
[340:50.30]Because it's just, there's fucking rats die on your wall.
[340:54.48]The internet sucks.
[341:00.27]Your dishwasher's broken.
[341:01.39]You can't get a guy to come out and look at your dryer vent.
[341:07.06]But if you were a family unit, then of course.
[341:14.94]Absolute unit.
[341:16.52]No, I'm talking about a family unit.
[341:26.75]An absolute family unit.
[341:32.77]Absolute unit is one of my favorite phrases.
[341:37.40]This guy is a fucking absolute unit.
[341:41.39]But yeah, don't live in a fucking house.
[341:43.96]Painful.
[341:45.44]And let's add a little bit of a... Let's add a hash here.
[341:49.86]So I'm going to do a hash, space, enter, bracket, you know, variable for the code.
[341:56.69]Variable dash hash, slash hash, dash, quotes, bracket.
[342:03.37]You have a million dollars.
[342:06.47]Bracket.
[342:07.21]That's the sub hash underneath the first line of code, which was family unit.
[342:11.05]You know what I'm saying?
[342:13.10]So, you got a million fucking dollars?
[342:15.96]Doesn't matter.
[342:16.52]Buy a house.
[342:16.98]Who cares?
[342:18.45]Then just trash it.
[342:20.17]And then rebuild it.
[342:21.39]It's not going to matter if you have a million dollars.
[342:23.27]Go buy a house for like $212,000.
[342:24.37]And then just run it over with a truck.
[342:27.87]And then rebuild it for fun.
[342:29.09]At that point, the family unit doesn't even matter.
[342:37.47]Jeremy, please.
[342:37.97]I need to go to sleep.
[342:39.07]End the stream.
[342:43.97]I'm not like holding you hostage.
[342:48.49]You guys aren't like in my fucking basement.
[342:51.61]And I'm like opening the door to yell down like, you ain't fucking leaving.
[342:56.46]You understand?
[342:57.36]The stream's still on.
[342:58.78]None of you guys can fucking leave.
[343:08.04]The stream is over.
[343:08.99]The stream has ended.
[343:11.99]Alright, look.
[343:13.63]Add another hash.
[343:15.27]This is a different line of code.
[343:17.57]Open up another notepad.
[343:19.81]And add this to the INI file.
[343:22.54]The stream is over.
[343:25.96]See the screen?
[343:26.92]Stream over.
[343:29.34]This is the after stream.
[343:31.84]Talk about dead rats.
[343:32.79]You know what I'm saying?
[343:36.34]You're free to go.
[343:37.02]If you don't want to watch the rest.
[343:40.37]The stream's over at this point.
[343:44.35]Hash the stream is over.
[343:48.85]But it's live.
[343:50.59]The broadcast... Hold on.
[343:52.54]The broadcast is live, but the stream is over.
[343:56.26]Right?
[343:58.54]Right?
[344:00.52]Broadcast is still going.
[344:02.24]The stream is live.
[344:03.65]Broadcast is over.
[344:04.69]Broadcast is live.
[344:05.89]The stream is over.
[344:08.97]Pause the stream.
[344:10.29]Thank you, SwaggyBot, for the 15 bucks.
[344:13.29]Jeremy, it's my birthday.
[344:14.41]You're the absolute best.
[344:15.25]A true king among men.
[344:16.16]I can't thank you enough for the content you create.
[344:18.22]Thank you.
[344:19.88]Thank you, SwaggyBot.
[344:20.72]Appreciate it.
[344:24.04]Thank you for the 15 dollars.
[344:24.92]I'm glad you're having fun.
[344:28.69]Stick around.
[344:29.73]Hopefully there's more for you to see.
[344:33.57]Uh, if I'm honest?
[344:34.07]Auto.
[344:57.15]You big move out.
[344:58.19]Uh, yeah, auto.
[345:00.51]Because, I mean, I was living alone.
[345:02.41]So... You wouldn't believe... What happened, like, a little dog... Or even, you know, if it's not a pet... Uh, I mean, that's my only advice, really, is... Because that's how I did it.
[345:18.22]You can't bring a pet or anything.
[345:19.72]Or if you don't like to have animals... Then, you know...
[345:25.10]That's your prerogative.
[345:26.28]But moving out and living alone, like completely alone, was much easier with Otto.
[345:36.11]Because it was like a little friend.
[345:37.25]It was a guy.
[345:37.97]It was a little dude that was just always around.
[345:40.31]Always happy to see you.
[345:41.23]Always willing to hang out and watch TV on the couch.
[345:45.23]He was a companion.
[345:45.99]You know what I mean?
[345:46.71]It's not like you're just like, oh shit, it's fucking silent in here.
[345:49.31]This is fucking weird.
[345:57.45]Yeah, there's a little dude.
[346:00.21]But that's really the best advice.
[346:01.27]If you're not going to have any roommates or anything.
[346:04.63]But... Oh, you could get some rats.
[346:08.44]They'll come in without you wanting them to.
[346:10.68]Like, a mouse will come in.
[346:11.64]But, I mean, it's still fine.
[346:12.70]It'll die on your wall.
[346:14.76]And, you know, you'll walk in your house and... Oh!
[346:18.76]Disgusting, smelly, dead animal!
[346:20.51]Oh, my companion!
[346:21.49]Oh, okay.
[346:21.81]Now, you'll be reminded that there's somebody else in the house.
[346:23.63]I mean, they're dead.
[346:24.99]But they're in the house.
[346:27.71]So there's that.
[346:33.64]But yeah.
[346:34.64]Good luck to you, man.
[346:35.24]That's a big step.
[346:42.26]Maybe you're into life.
[346:43.09]You don't have to have a dog.
[346:45.85]But animals are great companions and they're really stress reducing.
[346:49.07]They help you kind of cope with all the bullshit from living alone or living out for the first time.
[346:54.75]It's a good idea.
[346:57.98]thanks a lot I wish you luck calm slime thanks for the one dollar uh uh cheer 100 payload what's t he what is t he p lo what's that they say t he p lo and then they burped or something and then he's a cheer 100.

[347:31.42]Thank you, Combine, for the $1.
[347:32.86]Hey, Jerma, I've been down, uh, real down lately because my dog just got paralyzed.
[347:37.60]Fuck, man.
[347:39.40]She was a dachshund, so it comes with the breed.
[347:41.47]Just wanted to say that your streams always make me happy.
[347:44.27]So thanks.
[347:45.13]Also, try rapidly going left to right on the left analog stick when Wei is talking to people.
[347:50.07]You won't be disappointed.
[347:52.55]Well, that's horrible to hear about your dog.
[347:55.83]Uh, dachshunds do have a lot of back problems and spine issues.
[348:02.75]So, yeah, it does come with the breed.
[348:05.09]I'm so sorry to hear about that.
[348:11.18]But hopefully, um, is it just, is it the back legs or front leg?
[348:17.20]What is, what's, um, how is she paralyzed?
[348:19.86]Paralyzed.
[348:21.86]Just out of curiosity.
[348:23.06]You know?
[348:23.42]Because usually it's... Back legs tend to go.
[348:32.73]But that's terrible.
[348:34.99]I wish you the best.
[348:35.61]And thank you for the $1.
[348:39.19]I appreciate it.
[348:43.93]Thank you, Official Blues.
[348:46.98]Official Blues.
[348:48.92]KY.
[348:49.54]Thanks for the $1.
[348:51.30]I don't know what this says.
[348:53.72]It says... It's a... I don't know if this is Chinese or... I'm not sure what it is.
[349:01.23]I have to Google Translate this.
[349:02.79]It said something about JermaCraft and Minecraft and it's all in some Asian language.
[349:08.33]So let's find out what it is.
[349:09.45]I'm going to assume it's Chinese because we were playing Sleeping Dogs and we were playing in Hong Kong.
[349:13.83]Let's see.
[349:15.19]Google...
[349:16.54]Translate.
[349:17.12]I see Minecraft and I see JermaCraft, so... Uh, let's see.
[349:21.33]Here it is.
[349:23.43]Translating.
[349:24.01]This is Chinese to English.
[349:27.73]This is what they said.
[349:28.43]I'm gonna read it.
[349:29.55]Let's read it.
[349:33.19]I can't cheer in my own channel.
[349:35.23]What the fuck are you talking about?
[349:37.07]I'm not trying to cheer.
[349:38.17]Oh, god damn it.
[349:38.75]It's gonna have that.
[349:39.45]Uh, that's what it says.
[349:43.00]So it's, uh, ladies and gentlemen, hello, welcome to the first episode of Jermacraft, my series of Minecraft games.
[349:48.97]This will be a single player game where I, when I say let's play, I use the word loosely because I'm an idiot in this game.
[349:53.87]You'll see a lot of failures, you'll see a lot of victories, at least I hope so.
[349:57.22]Grab a hot cup of coffee and a cup of cocoa.
[349:59.08]I freshly made cider here, let me have a drink.
[350:01.44]Ah, that's some good cider.
[350:04.88]Now let me read that in Chinese.
[350:07.88]Uh, it's... This is gonna, this is gonna be hard.
[350:14.35]Am I doing this good enough?
[350:17.81]Sounds pretty good, right?
[350:19.51]I'm trying.
[350:19.79]I'm actually trying.
[350:43.85]Wait, what did I say?
[350:47.00]Hold on, I lost my place.
[351:05.54]One thing I want to share with you today is because I want to tell you that you will see a lot of people, you will see a lot of people who are willing to give up their lives, give up their coffee, give up their
[351:38.15]Well, this is hard.
[351:40.42]Speaking other languages is fucking hard.
[351:45.76]Does anybody in here speak Chinese?
[351:47.00]Am I even close?
[351:54.50]Sounds like Charlie Kelly when he's convinced he can speak Chinese, but he's speaking gibberish.
[352:08.38]That's a surprisingly good accent.
[352:09.92]Ever take a crack at another language?
[352:11.40]No.
[352:15.20]I mean, like, Kim obviously has taught me a few things in Vietnamese just because I was curious before.
[352:25.09]Other languages just fascinate me.
[352:30.68]No one speaks Chinese.
[352:31.56]They speak either Cantonese or Mandarin.
[352:33.98]Ah, right, right, right.
[352:40.63]when's the tim Allen sub sound yeah I know I'm an idiot but yeah Kim has taught me some vietnamese she speaks it fluently so easy to learn from her but uh let's keep going here uh from uh we're wed 40 thanks for the one dollar Jerma you ever checked out the urban dictionary translation for Jerma
[353:09.98]I don't think I want to, but I'm going to.

[353:15.51]What did you guys do?

[353:38.11]The fuck does that even mean?
[353:48.96]How does that?

[353:49.74]I can't.
[353:50.02]I don't follow that.
[353:51.22]But anyways, there it is.

[355:00.79]But thank you TechnoToast for the 50 cents.
[355:02.24]Streamer talks about getting asshole tattoos on stream.
[355:06.12]It would make sense.
[355:07.76]Mostly lost thanks to the $1.
[355:09.18]I'm mature now.
[355:09.94]Immediately makes pee joke.
[355:11.02]I didn't make a pee joke.
[355:12.02]I just went to the bathroom three times in a row.
[355:15.00]Bro luck thanks to the $1.50.
[355:16.35]How are you coping with the smells?
[355:19.19]Earlier I had an air purifier just running at max down here.
[355:23.41]And it worked pretty well.
[355:25.49]But over the course of the last six hours down here.
[355:30.66]You know, the smell permeates back in over six hours.
[355:33.31]It was alright for the first couple hours, but it started to really be annoying in like hour three or four.
[355:39.50]Thank you, StixRenegade, a Stix that I thank you for the one dollar.
[355:42.24]Three seconds might be unnatural, but so are your four minute pee breaks.
[355:47.77]Yeah, but I'm not peeing for four minutes.
[355:49.33]I'm going into the bathroom.
[355:51.15]I'm peeing.
[355:51.87]I'm looking in the mirror.
[355:53.72]I'm like putting my fingers on my nose and scratching my nose.
[355:56.74]I'm blinking a couple times.
[355:58.96]I'm opening the fridge.
[356:00.74]I'm closing the fridge.
[356:02.58]I'm opening the fridge again, looking up and down.
[356:06.64]Close the fridge again.
[356:08.66]Go into the mirror one more time.
[356:12.00]Maybe pee a little bit longer.
[356:13.20]Go pee one more time.
[356:14.68]Open the fridge.
[356:15.24]Finally figure out what I want to take from the fridge.
[356:19.20]And then come back downstairs.
[356:21.52]Maybe say hi to Otto.
[356:22.92]Or if Kim's upstairs, say hello to Kim.
[356:28.72]That's the biggest human problem.
[356:32.79]Is opening and closing a fridge like seven times.
[356:35.83]And knowing what you thought you wanted on the fourth time.
[356:39.87]But you don't pull the trigger on it.
[356:41.77]And then you end up doing something else on the seventh fridge open.
[356:44.09]Fridge open.
[356:47.17]Fridge number seven, you get something else, and you eat it, or you consume it, and then you wish you did the one at four.
[356:53.71]Happens a lot.
[356:55.95]Thank you, Son of Jenova, for the one dollar.
[356:57.39]Haha, peeing without washing your hands.
[356:59.91]And then they say XD, LOL in capitals, like this here.
[357:08.90]Like this.
[357:11.58]Thank you, Son of Jenova.
[357:13.38]Thanks TechnoToast again for the 50 cents.
[357:14.88]Local mature 30 year old streamer refuses to do the naked main character joke but will make pee jokes.
[357:20.84]Yeah, but the naked main character joke is the streamer YouTuber joke.
[357:27.01]Can you imagine if I was playing like that the whole game?
[357:32.41]It would be predictable.
[357:33.81]You know what else is predictable?
[357:35.67]Being the Oscar.
[357:38.23]I want to put the Just Cause outfit on and fly around.
[357:40.79]That sounds like a lot of fun.
[357:42.39]Hey, Monty the Moose, thanks for the 25 cents.
[357:43.97]Most of the world drives on the right side.
[357:45.77]FailFish.
[357:46.29]That's not true.
[357:50.07]Hold on.
[357:51.59]Countries that drive on the right side.
[357:55.60]Okay, here we go.
[358:01.46]Countries that drive on the left or right.
[358:04.76]Oh, shit.
[358:05.78]The entire world drives on the right.
[358:09.70]Yeah, so excuse me.
[358:11.03]Wait a minute.
[358:11.45]Hold on a second.
[358:14.49]China doesn't... China's not supposed to drive on the right.
[358:18.23]China's not supposed to drive on the left side of the road, according to this.
[358:21.97]This is a bullshit.
[358:22.71]This is fake news.
[358:31.34]This says it's one country in South America, the UK, Japan, India...
[358:40.36]Southern Africa, Australia, and all those... All those fucking random... All those random, like, booger countries that are above Australia.
[358:48.63]You know what I'm talking about?
[358:52.19]What even are those places?
[358:53.33]Let me look at the map.
[358:56.93]Map of the world.
[358:57.51]You know what I'm talking about?
[359:07.08]Look, for instance...
[359:08.94]Like the Solomon Islands.
[359:12.30]Nobody lives in the Solomon Islands.
[359:18.88]You ever been to the Solomon Islands?
[359:20.06]There's like nine people that live there.
[359:34.87]Some of these places are small.
[359:36.11]Some of these places are smaller than Rhode Island.
[359:38.91]Rhode Island's a fucking booger state, you understand?
[359:42.97]Rhode Island is a booger state.
[359:48.57]You know what?
[359:49.45]Connecticut is a booger state.
[359:51.22]It's a small, like, little booger.
[359:58.32]Did you just call the entirety of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea booger countries?
[360:03.32]No, I called them what they look like on a map.
[360:05.80]And I told you, I'd say the same thing about fucking Rhode Island.
[360:08.85]I'd say the same thing about, what are these random, what about up here over Antarctica?
[360:13.87]In Canada?
[360:14.89]No, not in Canada, I mean.
[360:18.05]Okay, go to Canada and go up.
[360:21.46]Go up from Canada and you're gonna see a place called Resolute.
[360:25.52]Those, look at all those boogers up there.
[360:27.34]Like they'll, what are these places?
[360:30.52]Like the Arctic Ocean?
[360:33.56]It's nothing to do with who's there.
[360:34.60]It has to do with what the country looks like on a map.
[360:36.46]It's tiny.
[360:42.53]I live in the Solomon Islands.
[360:48.09]Boston's a booger city.
[360:49.95]You know what?
[360:50.87]I'm sure it is.
[360:52.91]I'm not... Wait.
[360:54.09]I'm not shit-talking.
[360:56.01]I'm just saying they're very small little specks on the map.
[361:04.58]Let's look at, let's see some, what's like the smallest booger state in America?
[361:09.10]It's like, fucking look at it, like Rhode Island, Delaware.
[361:13.78]These are boogers.
[361:16.50]I determine what a booger country or a booger state is by, can I drive from one end of the booger to the other end of the booger in like 37 minutes?
[361:28.12]Hawaii?
[361:28.60]Yep, you know what?
[361:29.44]You're right.
[361:30.04]Thank you for saying that.
[361:30.90]Hawaii?
[361:31.82]Not necessarily the main land of Hawaii.
[361:34.78]Let's take a look.
[361:39.53]Okay, so there's... Nah, Hawaii is a bunch of boogers, you're right.
[361:45.75]Especially like, okay, let's go over here.
[361:47.87]There's a place called Puwai.
[361:50.77]I feel like if I went to Puwai...
[361:53.89]I would be claustrophobic because the place was smaller than my backyard.
[362:00.73]That's not even true.
[362:03.51]I must be like a fucking trillionaire.
[362:13.52]Quit while you're ahead.
[362:20.51]Oh.
[362:21.92]That has nothing to do with who's there.
[362:25.20]They're probably wonderful fucking people.
[362:28.29]I'm just saying.
[362:28.91]On a map, it looks like there's a bunch of small little specks.
[362:49.65]I didn't call anybody boogers.
[362:54.43]It's the shape of the states and countries.
[363:05.98]Look, it's late.
[363:06.82]Come on.
[363:07.26]Give me a break.
[363:08.66]This is like six hours of streaming.
[363:11.52]I'm tired.
[363:12.16]I'm hungry.
[363:14.82]In the grand scale of the universe, the Earth is a booger.
[363:16.96]Thank you.
[363:20.16]Right now, there is an alien streaming on an alien fucking video game streaming platform.
[363:25.73]He's talking to his chat in his post-stream hangout, and they're in the galactic fucking... ...Gorpio, right?
[363:33.46]They're 5,000 light years away.
[363:35.64]He's looking at a map right now, laughing his ass off.
[363:38.52]He's like, first of all, he's like...
[363:41.44]You see, it took place over in Balzad.
[363:44.46]Yeah, but watch this over here.
[363:45.89]You know, over Balzad, there's this booger planted over here, Earth.
[363:49.69]And a bunch of people just fucking freaked out in his chat.
[363:53.41]And he's doing the same thing I'm doing.
[363:54.87]He's zooming in.
[363:55.37]He's going, but no, you don't understand.
[363:56.37]Look at this.
[363:56.75]See how small it is?
[363:57.63]It looks like a sneeze.
[363:59.03]It looks like a small, tiny little blip.
[364:00.64]And that's what I meant.
[364:01.36]And everyone's giving him shit.
[364:02.28]They're saying, what the fuck, man?
[364:03.08]How could you say something like that?
[364:11.91]Okay, let's fucking go.
[364:14.54]Before I dig the sixth foot of dirt into the grave and lie in it.
[364:24.42]I'm at five feet right now.
[364:26.76]I go a little bit further and I'm gonna lie down and then you guys just gonna have to cover me.
[364:34.49]Thanks, Monty the Moose, for the 25 cents.
[364:37.39]Most of the world drives on the right side.
[364:40.23]That's where it came from.
[364:44.43]Thank you, MetalSand, for the 50 cents.
[364:47.33]Around 34% of the world's population drives on the left-hand side of the road, including the UK and many Commonwealth countries, including Australia, India, and South Africa, leaving about 66%.
[364:57.06]Thank you, Eves, for the $15.
[365:01.58]Thank you, Eves, man.
[365:05.48]Hey, Jeremy, hope you've been doing alright, man.
[365:07.20]Keep up the good work.
[365:07.95]I absolutely adore this game.
[365:09.27]But just off topic, did you ever watch Dragon Ball as a kid or an adult?
[365:13.53]I have not.
[365:15.44]I've never watched any of the Dragon Balls.
[365:18.91]Dragon Ball Super is out now, right?
[365:20.57]Wasn't it the last one they did?
[365:27.39]I've never seen it.
[365:29.39]But thanks, dude.
[365:29.93]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[365:30.71]Hope you're doing well as well.
[365:33.71]Djack, thanks for the 25 cents.
[365:35.03]These car segments just aren't the same without Girlfriend by Avril Lavigne.
[365:41.04]I tend to agree with you.
[365:43.97]Eefs, thanks again for the $1, and here's another dollar just for the all-time sake.
[365:46.83]Wow, thanks, man.
[365:50.87]Thanks for the $1.
[365:51.73]Appreciate it.
[365:52.41]I keep thinking about this.
[365:54.27]I keep thinking about the fucking booger shit.
[366:00.14]Fuck me.
[366:00.76]Thank you, Roguefort, for the 25 cents.
[366:02.42]Hey, Jerma, I come with a game you might have already heard of, but I just want to put it on the table.
[366:06.90]Slime Rancher.
[366:08.81]An extremely casual game with a focus on simple yet satisfying tasks with a minor but heartwarming plot woven in.
[366:16.48]A decent game to play on or off on a rainy day.
[366:20.14]Who knows?
[366:20.66]You'd probably find a way to make it hilarious like you always seem to do.
[366:23.60]Looking forward to that wood stream, by the way.
[366:26.21]Yes.
[366:29.59]Wood stream will be fun.
[366:30.97]It's probably going to happen more than you think.
[366:32.43]Because every time I lose internet, we're going in the woods.
[366:36.55]Hey Broluck, thanks for the $15.
[366:37.91]Not a lot makes me happy anymore.
[366:40.57]But when I watch your stream, I get so happy like a child would.
[366:43.21]Thanks, man.
[366:44.21]Thank you, Broluck.
[366:48.27]That means a lot, dude.
[366:49.27]Like, thank you.
[366:51.99]I really hope the best for you, man.
[366:54.81]Take care of yourself.
[366:59.83]But thank you for the $15.
[367:00.33]Didn't I say I watched Steins Gate?
[367:04.38]Yeah, I did.
[367:07.67]I wasn't a big fan of Steins Gate, but I did watch it.
[367:12.29]I feel like Steins Gate had a really, like, interesting story and interesting concept that they hid underneath doot-da-doos.
[367:18.87]You know what I'm saying?
[367:20.67]They had a great, like, fucking really cool, interesting concept, and they ran into a doot-da-doo problem.
[367:29.98]If that makes sense to anybody here.
[367:50.29]No offense, but I actually fell asleep during your stream and missed like three hours of it.
[367:55.21]What are we talking about this?
[367:56.82]What did somebody say?
[367:57.88]Somebody fell asleep during a whole... Oh, I got a story for you.
[368:02.24]No, I gotta tell this on stream.
[368:03.88]This is fucking hilarious.
[368:06.52]This is an on-stream story with more people around.
[368:10.06]It's about how one of my friends was so excited to go do something, and they slept through the entire event and didn't see one thing.
[368:17.66]Oh, it was so perfect.
[368:18.95]I can't wait to tell you it.
[368:20.71]We gotta go to, we gotta go to, it's sleepy time.
[368:22.97]We're gonna go with the last bit on bits.
[368:25.99]No, I'm not on stream.
[368:26.97]This is, this is, we already talked about this.
[368:28.33]This is a broadcast is live, the stream is over.
[368:35.01]Elaborate on what a Duke to do is.
[368:37.27]Sure.
[368:38.25]Sure.
[368:44.19]With pleasure, I will let you know what that is.
[368:48.17]Do you need the most trusted bat?
[368:50.41]It's not that.
[368:53.97]For the person that has no idea what's going on.
[368:58.67]These people eating chips.
[368:59.67]This is not what I was... Duracell.
[369:04.85]That's what I was talking about.
[369:14.13]Why would somebody do that?
[369:24.51]Somebody was eating batteries.
[369:42.19]Can somebody... I want to hear that.
[369:43.97]Can somebody clip that?
[369:48.00]It was like Duracell, trusted everywhere.
[369:54.78]Oh, fuck.
[369:55.48]I just gave myself a headache.
[369:58.84]Oh.
[370:04.19]You're dead if you eat fucking batteries.
[370:07.83]Oh.
[370:17.69]Good night, Tantors.
[370:19.71]Thanks for sticking around.
[370:23.05]Skipping around ads.
[370:25.23]Thank you, MooMeansMoo, for the $1.
[370:26.85]I could be watching Overwatch League or I could be paying a homeless man $30 to beat me to death.
[370:32.20]Equally enjoyable experiences.
[370:33.88]Jesus.
[370:42.62]Does anybody have a clip of that?
[370:44.72]I need to listen to it again.
[370:50.78]I want to watch it.
[370:55.94]Let's watch it.
[370:57.02]A person that has no idea what's going on.
[371:01.76]These people eating chips.
[371:02.80]This is not what I was... Duracell.
[371:13.27]Person that has no idea what's going on.
[371:14.71]People eating chips.
[371:18.79]This is not what I was... Duracell.
[371:20.69]What the fuck?
[371:37.49]Why do I think this is so funny?
[371:38.83]This is not even like... Ugh.
[371:44.66]Jesus Christ.
[371:52.35]Oh my god, that's doing it for me.
[371:53.71]I don't know why, but it is.
[371:54.61]Okay.
[372:05.96]I'm getting lost here, okay.
[372:07.74]OG Jephter, thank you for the five dollars.
[372:12.30]Thank party 100, you party 100.
[372:14.93]What is the party?
[372:16.49]Dermaparty for being a party, awesome party guy.
[372:20.91]Thank you.
[372:25.03]Sound like Eric Wareheim.
[372:34.00]You're making it harder.
[372:38.56]Ugh.
[372:42.75]Alright.
[372:44.61]Let's collect ourselves here.
[372:45.63]I just picture, like, in the commercial, people just eating handfuls of batteries.
[372:54.65]Like, that's what they're for.
[372:55.78]They're not for... People don't buy batteries anymore because, like, we have, like, charging devices.
[373:01.00]You plug your iPhone into a wall, you don't put Duracell batteries... Ugh.
[373:04.36]Ugh.
[373:07.09]The world's running out of food.
[373:08.29]Ai-yai-yai.
[373:11.04]Alright, let's go.
[373:12.06]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the 25 cents.
[373:13.62]I remember when I went to China, the amounts of Colossus from X-Men running around were staggering, so I'm astounded by the accuracy of the Chinese wardrobe presented in the game.
[373:24.46]Speaking of presenting, I just got done with my one-man SpongeBob show.
[373:28.58]The audience thought I was lip-syncing until I got to the female parts of the song.
[373:31.90]I wouldn't be as good as I am with voices without your support and voice acting prowess.
[373:36.28]You're changing lives, Jermo.
[373:37.82]All nine of them are super appreciative.
[373:39.38]Thank you, Garfield.
[373:43.06]Thank you, Garfield's Monday Killer.
[373:46.39]For the 25 cents.
[373:47.33]Base, Grandpa, thanks for the $1.
[373:48.75]Will you play the Detroit Become Human demo?
[373:52.23]I'll probably play the Detroit Become Human game when it comes out.
[373:57.17]I don't like playing demos.
[373:58.21]Ever since Vermintide 2, I don't want to do that shit anymore.
[374:03.67]I play a demo and I'm like, ah, yeah, cool, and I don't buy the game.
[374:06.71]I played Vermintide 2's beta demo.
[374:08.93]I'm done with betas.
[374:09.65]I'm done with demos.
[374:12.83]But I'd probably check out the actual game.
[374:18.58]Thank you, Roger Cheeto, for the $1.
[374:20.66]Just wanted to give a quick shout-out.
[374:22.06]Melted... Kick... Frighten... Tumble Fit... Pocket... Stuff... Natural... Is this, like, your password?
[374:35.62]Roger, this is not like your, like, like, seed to open up your bank account or something, right?
[374:42.84]Thank you, Thirsty, for the one dollar.
[374:44.32]Hey, Jerma, when are you going to stream Yakuza again?
[374:46.72]Anyway, thanks for streaming.
[374:50.20]I might be too... Yakuza really is such an interesting game, too, and I just fucking threw up in its face.
[375:00.15]Maybe one day we'll go back to that.
[375:02.35]Or isn't there... There's a new one coming out, too.
[375:06.64]Just stay tuned for that one.
[375:10.82]You want to watch the VOD, please?
[375:12.32]You're a VOD boy?
[375:14.44]Well, we don't got much time left here.
[375:17.34]Alright, alright.
[375:18.95]Speed reading time.
[375:20.13]Speed round.
[375:20.73]You ready?
[375:22.29]Garfield, thanks for the 25 cents.
[375:23.35]I remember my short relationship with Emma Stone.
[375:24.73]It was weird having to play the game with her in it.
[375:26.03]Except that it was Andrew Garfield.
[375:27.63]Ha, but seriously, I went through a nasty breakup a few years back with the first person to treat me with respect.
[375:31.91]It felt great while it lasted until she dumped me for her ex and never spoke to me again.
[375:37.15]I went into a deep depression for a long time until I discovered you through your videos.
[375:40.17]Thanks for getting me out of that rut with the current girlfriend.
[375:45.50]Thank you, Garfield.
[375:47.56]Garfield, I wish you the best.
[375:55.84]You are our favorite LARPing cat on this stream.
[376:02.93]But thanks a lot, man.
[376:06.87]um glad you could find any joy at all through my videos and streams thank you dude uh moo means moo thanks for the one dollar Emma stone can call me literally whatever she wants I don't care dragon breath 75 thanks for the one dollar hey jerobo I'm finally back from my long trip involving going to pax and I've caught up all the streams I missed
[376:32.66]Hope you remember me because it was just an absolute pleasure meeting you and getting a video of you doing Grandpa's voice.
[376:38.50]When I left the convention center on Sunday, on Saturday, after talking to you about how TF2 changed my life, I almost choked up a bit on the street.
[376:46.37]I love you, man.
[376:48.33]Of course I remember you.
[376:51.09]There weren't that many people.
[376:52.53]I mean, there were a lot of people at those meetups, but they were... I remember faces, stories, names, and everything, so I do remember you.
[377:02.96]Wait, shots fired by Etalyx.
[377:04.57]Garfield is the worst meme.
[377:09.43]Can we get him out of here?
[377:12.15]Can we get him out of here?
[377:13.93]What is he doing here?
[377:15.01]It's 1.30 in the morning.
[377:16.27]What is he doing?
[377:16.69]Why are you here?
[377:17.39]What are you doing here?
[377:26.13]Why don't you go eat some fucking batteries while you're at it?
[377:31.62]Unmod Etalyx.
[377:34.46]Now, but thank you, Dragon Breath.
[377:37.20]I hope you had a good Pax.
[377:43.01]Unmod him.
[377:44.73]No, I can't unmod him.
[377:46.11]He's unmoddable.
[377:48.07]He's un-unmoddable.
[377:50.71]He's a Grandfather Claus.
[377:51.65]He has tenure.
[377:52.67]I can't.
[377:53.44]I can't fire him.
[377:57.98]But yeah, much love to you, dude.
[377:59.07]Thank you, Dragon Breath.
[378:00.71]Look, I painted Garfield.
[378:01.77]I have a personal investment in this meme.
[378:03.39]I sold all shares.
[378:06.61]Garfield's not a meme.
[378:08.67]He's a terrible comic book character.
[378:11.71]Is that a meme?
[378:12.53]Or is that like a lifelong meme?
[378:14.63]What's the longest meme that's ever lived?
[378:17.52]The Numa Numa guy lasted like four years.
[378:22.94]That's the longest, probably.
[378:26.03]But thank you, McRage, for the 25 cents.
[378:30.51]Dig in the stream, Jerma.
[378:31.31]Love you.
[378:32.77]If my friend Mikey sees this, eat my ass.
[378:35.63]Well, hopefully he didn't see that.
[378:37.86]But thank you.
[378:39.00]Thank you, McRage.

[379:28.93]No, they're good people.
[379:31.66]I think I'll be streaming with Criken.
[379:35.94]Three of us will be probably doing something.
[379:40.46]I think there's going to be a stream with me, Criken, and somebody else.
[379:43.66]In the future.
[379:45.86]I don't know.
[379:51.37]No, I put not for a next time.

[380:38.25]That's personal.
[380:40.34]I go to McDonald's once or twice a week.
[380:41.96]That's personal.
[380:42.62]I don't want anyone to know that.
[380:44.95]Well, you know it now.
[380:46.13]But I wouldn't want somebody to know that about me, that I go to McDonald's twice a week.
[380:50.07]It's embarrassing shit.
[380:53.85]The Helping Llama thanks for the $1.

[381:09.56]It's true.
[381:13.75]Yeah, no, that's... I mean, you're right.
[381:16.23]Your lips are kind of your mouth inside out, but with a protectant film on it.

[381:58.84]There have been a lot of car accidents on this broadcast and in my videos.

[384:19.71]Easy.
[384:20.37]Easiest tongue twister you've ever fucking heard.
[384:29.13]I messed up a third time.

[385:15.07]Thank you for the years of smiles.
[385:16.11]They're truly priceless and irreplaceable.
[385:20.03]That was so many nice things to say about somebody in two sentences.
[385:25.74]Thank you, internet George, internet Jorge.
[385:30.94]That's... That floors me.
[385:33.46]Hearing this shit from people.
[385:35.28]Seriously.
[385:37.64]Thank you.
[385:39.86]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[385:41.32]A million times.
[385:44.46]I'm glad you're having fun.
[385:48.30]Eternally Gaming, thank you for the $1... Hey, JermaLongTimeFan, as a comedian, you're a big inspiration to me.
[385:56.66]As a gamer, you make me cry.
[385:57.80]You're so awful at times.
[385:59.01]Yeah.
[386:00.75]It's alright.
[386:03.13]I didn't do bad tonight.
[386:04.68]I was on top of it.
[386:05.76]I hacked the computers within the first... Remember when I hacked the computer in the first and second try?
[386:10.32]I was landing combos.
[386:13.87]I was paying attention.
[386:17.01]Thank you, Eternally Gaming, for the $1.
[386:18.47]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the $1.
[386:19.93]Please add jermaSnort.
[386:20.91]I haven't been this disappointed since the Pencil won Jerma Rumble 3.
[386:25.20]That's it.
[386:25.88]Confirmed.
[386:26.86]jermaSnort will be an available emote tomorrow afternoon.
[386:30.41]You heard it here.
[386:31.05]Confirm it right now.
[386:33.73]Can I get the confirm sound, please?
[386:38.89]Thank you.
[386:40.51]Confirmed.
[386:42.92]Hey, Upward Fern, thanks for the $2.45.
[386:44.24]Yo, my boy, I decided I'm going through, with a really big decision, I'm going through welding school while working a grocery stocking job overnight.
[386:56.70]Any ideas on how not to go fucking insane?
[386:58.94]By the way, you're my favorite content creator.
[387:00.34]Keep up the good work.
[387:01.20]You inspire me to do my best in everything I do.
[387:04.54]well it's first of all they're it's very difficult to do school full-time and do a job full-time as well so I would say I mean here's the one good thing grow a stocking job
[387:22.28]An overnight stalking job is very, you kind of can just let yourself go through the motions with a job like that, right?
[387:29.23]Like you can just go in, there's not a whole lot of people there.
[387:33.27]You could listen to like a podcast.
[387:34.47]You can essentially try to relax during that job.
[387:40.55]Because the one thing you can think of is at least it's not a high, like, mental thought.
[387:47.89]You have to, like, process a bunch of shit.
[387:49.91]You can just kind of go through the motions in a job like that.
[387:53.76]So... I would say try not to work yourself to death.
[388:01.42]Because it's not good for you, man.
[388:03.82]Like, if you can... I don't know what your situation is or anything, but...
[388:08.85]If you can drop some of those hours... Because you need sleep going overnight into school the next day.
[388:17.65]It's a welding job, you know what I'm saying?
[388:19.17]Like, you're holding fire in your hands.
[388:21.27]You're burning metal at 10 billion degrees Celsius.
[388:25.53]You know what I'm saying?
[388:26.41]You gotta be alert for that.
[388:27.35]Remember when he said it was speed reading time?
[388:35.12]But, in all honesty...
[388:37.39]I can't really give you that much advice on this because I've never done something like that before.
[388:40.91]I know it's excruciatingly difficult.
[388:48.96]I know that that is so hard to do that.
[388:52.52]But when I was in school, I just went to school.
[388:55.48]I didn't do school and work at the same time.
[388:57.34]I know there are people that go to school, they work two jobs, and you don't even have any time for yourself and it can drive you fucking crazy.
[389:05.53]so I really do wish you the best of luck just try not to overdo it especially with an overnight job you'd still need sleep you know what I mean but thanks a lot friend best of luck to you uh son of jenova thanks for the one dollar they say go back to 4chan and then they do that face that like disappointed exhausted annoyed face
[389:33.25]Ow.
[389:33.41]I was going to say something, but instead it came out as like a painful air.
[389:36.93]Hey, NoVay333, thanks for the 25 cents.
[389:41.27]I just got here.
[389:41.79]Did you ever rant about ants tonight?
[389:43.17]Nope.
[389:44.79]The ants are math conversation.
[389:46.80]They're going to have to be for another time.
[389:49.86]Hey, Frextur, thanks for the $1.
[389:51.62]It's AM here.
[389:52.32]I just woke up and you're still live.
[389:53.54]This is weird.
[389:55.84]This is like six and a half hours.
[389:57.68]Going on seven hours.
[390:00.75]Hey, good morning.
[390:02.31]Almost done.
[390:03.09]Zmanreal78, thanks for the 25 cents.
[390:04.77]Are you a coffee man or would you rather just eat Cheetos?
[390:06.76]I'm a chicken man myself.
[390:08.04]Good work.
[390:09.02]You got it.
[390:10.28]Coffee though.
[390:11.40]GarfieldTheMondayKiller, thanks for the 25 cents.
[390:13.38]Garphagraph incoming.
[390:16.89]I know you aren't the least bit excited for Infinity War, but I'm curious to hear about what other movies you enjoyed.
[390:22.78]Based off your past opinions, you like works of Doug TenNapel and Cuphead.
[390:27.66]I think you'd like Warner Brothers Animation.
[390:29.20]Their films seem to have the fast-paced humor you excel at.
[390:32.88]If you could give any series their own movie or universe, which would you give the green light and which studio would you trust?
[390:38.35]My pick is Mario since Italian and lasagna, ha.
[390:43.67]Well, uh, interestingly enough, I'm really not into, I'm not into, like, the whole Marvel scene.
[390:49.41]Here's the thing, though, I am really excited for Deadpool 2.
[390:55.32]Just because Deadpool was fun and interesting and it was funny and, you know, Deadpool 2 is just a continuation of the same movie that you saw two years ago.
[391:05.74]So I'm really excited for that.
[391:07.94]But, um...
[391:11.28]Stuff like Cuphead, Doug TenNapel.
[391:14.41]Those works.
[391:16.33]I just like odd shit.
[391:17.83]I like the oddities.
[391:19.02]I like when things aren't done normally.
[391:22.78]I'm not really excited for Venom.
[391:24.14]Venom sounds like it's going to be the Resident Evil movie all over again.
[391:28.80]There's like a T-Virus story arc they're going with here.
[391:33.05]I'm not really okay with it.
[391:35.95]Judging by the trailers.
[391:38.27]It seems like a little Resident Evil original movie-ish here.
[391:46.16]You don't got me yet.
[391:50.84]Who would I give a green light to for a movie or a universe?
[391:56.47]Give a series their own movie.
[391:57.85]Um...
[392:00.42]I don't know.
[392:01.42]That's a really hard question.
[392:03.28]That's an overnight question.
[392:05.52]I can't really think about that.
[392:07.87]Hawkeye, mine thanks for the $1.
[392:09.13]That's actually a surprisingly good accent.
[392:10.53]Ever take a crack at another language?
[392:11.75]We've talked about it before.
[392:14.83]Not really.
[392:16.63]I failed out of Spanish pretty much back in high school, so I'm going to really try it again.
[392:21.96]And what's going on?
[392:22.90]Do you hear this?
[392:24.42]I think the fucking rat air is getting into my throat.
[392:28.09]Hey, thank you, ZmanReal78.
[392:31.03]These stupid science bitches couldn't even make me more smarter.
[392:35.65]What's going on?
[392:38.59]It's filling my lungs.
[392:41.73]That's a great Always Sunny in Philadelphia joke.
[392:45.30]That's a great show.
[392:49.28]There you go.
[392:50.14]Always Sunny in Philadelphia movie.
[392:51.50]That's a series I want to see as a movie.
[392:55.51]I didn't click, I didn't click anything.
[392:57.23]I didn't touch anything.
[393:00.35]I didn't touch anything.
[393:02.13]Why is this playing?
[393:04.93]Stay away from me.
[393:11.37]Okay.
[393:14.95]Oh, okay.
[393:15.55]I accidentally clicked the thing above.
[393:17.09]Thank you, Shanman, for the 1982, the $10.
[393:18.77]They just say cheer $10.
[393:19.79]Thanks a lot, man.
[393:24.33]Dr. Clay gave $5 and said, I always forget how loud you can yell.
[393:29.14]This is not Jerma's snort.
[393:30.52]It was this.
[393:31.22]Yes.
[393:33.56]Yes.
[393:34.24]I'm also annoyed.
[393:37.31]I also don't.
[393:37.89]It just comes out, man.
[393:39.57]It's like a sneeze.
[393:42.19]Like 10 left.
[393:43.13]We got 10 left.
[393:43.97]Freddy Fingers, thanks for the $1.
[393:45.23]Jerma, love you.
[393:45.76]You're amazing.
[393:46.18]Thank you, Freddy.
[393:47.63]Love you too.
[393:48.54]Thank you, Jay Rooster, for the $1.

[393:52.00]Yeah, he gets a little upset sometimes.
[393:54.04]Upward Fur, thanks for the $1.
[393:55.44]You said you liked CT.
[393:59.18]jermaPluto.
[393:59.80]What is CT?
[394:02.42]CT.
[394:05.35]Chrono Trigger?
[394:07.57]Chrono Trigger?
[394:08.91]What is CT?
[394:11.41]Thank you.
[394:13.72]For the $1.25 on top of that, Upward Fern.
[394:18.38]Dude, watch the original Dragon Ball Z for your yearly anime.
[394:22.00]There's too many of them.
[394:25.68]Oh, Connecticut.
[394:26.54]Oh.
[394:27.70]I guess it's a booger state, yeah.
[394:31.00]We already talked about this, we're gonna move on.
[394:33.08]But thank you for the $2.25 here, Upward Fern.
[394:37.32]It would take me a year to watch Dragon Ball.
[394:39.30]Aren't there like 900 episodes?
[394:42.55]Thank you MoveMeansMoon for the $1.
[394:44.06]I'm with you on the whole Dragon Ball thing.
[394:45.86]If I wanted to experience someone screaming for 60 minutes straight, I'd eat two pounds of cheese and hope for the best.
[394:52.52]Thank you, dude.
[394:53.04]Thank you again for the $1.
[394:53.79]Do you want to see the world's most trusted bad Crunch Crunch Duracell?

[395:16.74]Eat it up.
[395:17.60]Clueless Sniper.
[395:18.22]Thanks for the $1.
[395:18.88]I don't know why, but that shit with the batteries gave me the hardest laugh in months.
[395:22.14]My face hurts now.
[395:22.98]Have some bits.
[395:23.51]Thank you.
[395:24.43]Me too.
[395:26.43]Eat the burger.
[395:26.95]Thanks for the $1.
[395:27.71]They just say Jeremy in all caps.
[395:29.15]Thanks, dude.
[395:30.83]DSGZ.
[395:31.57]Thanks for the $2.50.
[395:32.11]Hey, Jerma.
[395:32.81]Thanks for that battery laughter.
[395:33.95]I needed that tonight.
[395:35.47]Just want to tell you that I recently performed an Italian love song at a recital at my university.
[395:40.35]I honestly believe my love for voice acting and singing began with you and your wacky antics, so thanks.
[395:46.63]Thank you, DS.
[395:49.20]I hope you killed it.
[395:51.42]Hope you did well.
[395:53.46]Thank you for using me as your inspiration.
[395:58.60]That is an incredibly fucking humbling thing to say.
[396:01.74]Well, to hear, you know.
[396:04.47]Thank you.
[396:06.05]Thanks for the $2.50, dude.
[396:10.67]Oh, I missed the stream again.
[396:11.65]Thank you for the emotes, Jerma.
[396:13.27]There'll be another one tomorrow.
[396:14.85]Confirm it here!
[396:15.59]Another one tomorrow!
[396:18.93]jermaSnort!
[396:19.91]You'll see it.
[396:20.33]Why?
[396:22.27]What?
[396:34.79]You don't have to change your name because somebody said that.
[396:37.55]Thank you to Shpee for the $1.
[396:38.91]It's always worth it to see chat's reaction when you say Shpee.
[396:41.89]Thank you for giving me such good alt username.
[396:44.01]jermaMustard.
[396:44.75]Thanks, dude.
[396:47.09]Niall Orian, thanks for the $1.
[396:48.84]I made it in time to catch the end of the stream.
[396:51.50]Love you, Dad.
[396:51.96]And they say Party 100.
[396:52.76]Are you guys actually going to tell me what's going on here with the party stuff?
[397:00.52]Me, MidVeed, thanks for the $5, you should check out Mind Game.
[397:06.61]It's an anime movie that's really hard to not appreciate, at least on an animation level.
[397:11.09]It's really trippy, and the director-artist has done guest episodes in some western cartoons like Adventure Time.
[397:15.83]That's interesting.
[397:16.83]You might check that out.
