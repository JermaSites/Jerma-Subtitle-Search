[00:00.01]Wait, talk.
[00:00.53]I don't think people can hear you.
[00:02.59]Oh, shit.
[00:03.67]Talk.
[00:04.05]I don't think people can hear you.
[00:05.33]Oh, shit.
[00:05.65]I don't think people can hear you.
[00:09.26]I have one of those, too.
[00:10.72]Oh, shit.
[00:11.10]I don't think people can hear you.
[00:12.44]Oh, shit.
[00:12.80]I don't think people can hear you.
[00:14.02]I can do that, too.
[00:14.74]Oh, shit.
[00:15.12]I don't think people can hear you.
[00:16.72]You didn't do anything.
[00:18.20]Wait, I didn't do anything?
[00:19.60]No.
[00:20.55]I didn't miss it.
[00:21.45]I'm here.
[00:22.17]We're here.
[00:22.63]I know you're here.
[00:24.47]I'm just, you know, this was my big break.
[00:29.64]Alright, look, hold on.
[00:30.36]How do I turn this down?
[00:31.28]Okay, hold on.
[00:31.62]I'm here!
[00:31.84]See?
[00:31.96]Camera's in the wrong place.
[00:32.94]60 seconds!
[00:33.78]See, you don't ever go to the movie where the previews are on.
[00:50.61]Do I really need to see the Gemini Man trailer like 10 more times?
[00:53.87]I've already seen it.
[00:55.13]This is the same amount of time when we traveled together.
[01:00.20]Like how much time was left in boarding.
[01:02.08]Yeah, you get right on the plane.
[01:07.20]You get right on the plane.
[01:08.74]I don't like this.
[01:11.16]Get to the terminal fucking like two hours early.
[01:14.36]No, you get right on the plane.
[01:17.15]Yeah, but what about Hillary's email?
[01:21.45]What about the people that don't know that you were going to stream and come in late?
[01:26.23]Okay, on my stream, you may not know this.
[01:28.11]It's E3.
[01:28.83]We've got a no chatter left behind policy.
[01:31.39]And if you don't start early, you're leaving people behind who didn't know.
[01:34.39]No, they were here.
[01:35.53]Which graphic t-shirt will Phil Spencer be wearing?
[01:38.15]Once they show up, they're gonna be like, oh shit, what'd I miss?
[01:40.59]And then they're gonna wait in chat for someone to tell them what they missed rather than watch the VOD.
[01:44.20]And you need to take care of that person.
[01:47.16]I forgot how to deafen you in Discord.
[01:49.22]So, like, you're gonna have to just be aware to not talk during the cutscenes.
[01:52.64]How do I do it?
[01:53.76]What's the button?
[01:55.12]I'm gonna talk during the cutscenes.
[01:57.12]I have to be able to deafen you during the big reveal of Elden Ring.
[02:00.42]Okay, well, you've got 60 seconds to figure out how to do it.
[02:03.14]Alright, let me figure it out.
[02:04.64]I don't have to tweet that I'm here.
[02:07.33]I'm gonna tweet my mother that, like, we're about to get on the plane.
[02:13.12]I got a story for you, by the way.
[02:14.90]Oh, just wait.
[02:15.98]You want to know why I was late?
[02:17.26]I have a lot that I wanted to talk to you about, but I don't really have the time.
[02:20.84]We got the after show.
[02:22.08]That's what that's for.
[02:22.76]We sit and we talk about what our thoughts were.
[02:25.70]Okay, so we're dead silent during the trailers, and then we wait until after the show to talk about them?
[02:31.64]Yeah.
[02:32.60]Well, not dead silent.
[02:33.98]You can, like, cough and make, like, old man noises.
[02:36.98]Oh, press conference.
[02:38.14]Oh, there we go.
[02:39.60]We just got our seats on the plane.
[02:45.33]I think he hates me.
[02:46.81]Anyways, hi guys, welcome to E3.
[02:48.73]Show's gonna begin in 55 seconds.
[02:55.39]Okay, I gotta turn you up with this down.
[03:15.60]Okay, alright, I got it.
[03:16.98]What do you guys want to hear more?
[03:18.38]Me and Star's hilarious banter?
[03:20.24]They want to hear it.
[03:23.07]They want to hear...
[03:24.73]One is the future of gaming, with more ways to play than ever before.
[03:29.37]We're finally bringing to the home console the next generation.
[03:32.33]Shit, my stream is fucked.
[03:33.88]Why is my stream- Oh, fuck, hold on.
[03:35.12]I'm gonna disconnect for like five seconds.
[03:37.40]I'm lagging.
[03:37.86]Here we go, here we go!
[03:39.74]Sorry, I was running.
[03:41.56]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, welcome to the E3 conference, I'm here.
[03:44.54]I'm here, I'm here, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[03:45.84]Okay.
[03:47.81]Um, now if you could follow your own advice and please, the movie is starting.
[03:52.25]I want some complete silence.
[03:53.82]Alright, alright, alright.
[03:54.54]I'm good.
[03:54.84]I'm good.
[03:55.08]We're here.
[03:55.70]Full depth of the trailers they've worked a long time on creating.
[03:59.66]Shit, I gotta turn this off.
[04:04.92]What did you want to talk about?
[04:07.54]I don't have time.
[04:08.32]There is not enough time to get into it.
[04:10.95]It's like a whole thing.
[04:11.85]Why do I have all this Chipotle shit on the screen?
[04:14.51]Get this off the screen!
[04:15.97]How do I turn this off?
[04:17.01]How do I get this off?
[04:19.91]You click on the right side, there's a Twitch gaming pop-out, and you click on that, and you make sure it's set to not visible.
[04:27.97]Not visible.
[04:29.05]Alright, I'll be right back.
[04:33.25]Watch this guy.
[04:33.91]Todd is talking!
[04:35.20]Everyone around the world come together and celebrate what games mean to all of us.
[04:40.42]But you don't know how to mute me, so I'm self-conscious now.
[04:42.52]Fuck.
[04:43.52]Alright, stop.
[04:44.48]Todd's talking.
[04:45.30]For being with us today, thank you for the support you give us and one another.
[04:50.15]he thinks we're friends turning 20. and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the friendships we've had that whole time at bethesda we believe video games do one thing better than anything else they transport us through art and technology there's real magic when you step into a new world and can make it your own we've traveled the worlds of Elder Scrolls of fallout
[05:14.33]And now, for the first time in over 25 years, we're creating a new universe with Starfield.
[05:22.32]Oh, we already knew that.
[05:23.30]Hundreds of years in our future.
[05:24.76]You knew that?
[05:25.64]Did you know that?
[05:26.20]About hope, our shared humanity, and answering our greatest mystery.
[05:31.79]It's a game we've dreamt of playing, and it wasn't until now that we have the hardware, the technology, and the team who's hard at work at home to make that dream a reality.
[05:42.46]we're excited to finally share our first in-game teaser and something in game alright I'm on my phone are you what I was just like on my phone I wasn't paying attention alright quiet I did that during Elden Ring I didn't even realize it was on screen I just talked over it
[06:12.32]I mean, who cares?
[06:12.96]They're showing the unmodded version right now.
[06:16.56]Stop talking.
[06:17.16]Dude, am I the guy that has to tell his own friend to shut the fuck up at the movie?
[06:20.90]No one's... I'm talking about... He's walking.
[06:23.24]He's climbing a ladder.
[06:24.26]Can you visually see this?
[06:25.52]Or do you need your ears to hear the ladder clank?
[06:27.38]You may as well be smoking a cigarette next to me.
[06:29.85]Like, get the... Put that shit out.
[06:32.37]They say... Okay.
[06:33.61]The wonder is... Not that the field of stars is so vast... But that we have measured it...
[06:41.31]You're part of Constellation now, part of our family.
[06:47.12]What you found, it's the key to unlocking everything.
[06:56.56]We reach your Constellation.
[06:58.71]This is all we've been working towards.
[07:00.67]I have so many drinks here, I don't even know which one to drink.
[07:04.23]We've come to the beginning of humanity's final journey.
[07:07.69]Excuse me?
[07:11.07]That's why we're here.
[07:16.69]To discover what's out there.
[07:38.23]Yeah, no gameplay, no buy.
[07:40.44]Can I tell you, I'm sick of the space shit.
[07:41.60]Space shit is the new zombie shit.
[07:43.94]Didn't we see this movie already?
[07:46.48]Space shit is the new zombie shit.
[07:47.94]It's the new... I don't care for space stuff anymore.
[07:53.40]Okay, so... I mean, there's this gigantic, vast universe, and you just don't want anything to take place in it.
[08:01.16]It's just like, I'm sad, honestly, I'm sick of seeing the guy with the astronaut helmet on.
[08:05.06]I've seen it a thousand times.
[08:08.31]water I don't I'm sick of seeing alright quiet we can talk here one of the most anticipated games in the world from Todd Howard do you want to hear what she has to say alright dude imagine a movie that like every every like five to ten minutes it's stopped exclusive and like it let everybody just lights up like we just all discuss what we just saw I am so excited every 10 minutes you get to discuss what you just watched
[08:34.40]Well, yeah, I mean, how many buzzwords do you want to hear?
[08:37.34]It'd be somebody in the front row, just like... Hold on, the KomodoHype is filling up!
[08:40.95]What is it?
[08:42.19]The chat's getting KomodoHype right now.
[08:47.69]What is that?
[08:48.29]Well, it's only at 50%.
[08:51.85]That's not... That's 50%.
[08:53.46]You guys, you gotta spam it.
[08:57.44]Gamers, rise up.
[08:58.66]Not here.
[08:59.22]You spam it in the... We're streaming.
[09:01.20]No, it's Jerma's chat is the main chat.
[09:04.71]If you do it in there, it counts.
[09:06.15]It counts.
[09:06.49]It's all Twitch.
[09:07.51]It does not count.
[09:09.61]Of course it counts.
[09:10.43]Well, this looks bad.
[09:11.40]We can't even get it to 50%.
[09:12.42]Yeah, you gotta amp it up.
[09:12.96]If it gets to the top, they cancel Starfield.
[09:14.92]This is weird to have this on the screen.
[09:31.53]this is I don't know why this should not be on the screen no this is the equivalent of us saying do we just talk over her like they're trying to put something on the screen to entertain you while she just like does like the naruto filler like oh this is the last like five years of games we've released we're gonna tell you that we did this and
[09:50.69]Can you guys just, like, play with this toy we give you for a sec?
[09:54.29]But it's filled, so what happens?
[09:56.63]What if she looked over to the left of the screen and was like, Oh, the hype meter filled!
[10:01.65]That's what I put on the funny hat!
[10:03.56]And it's like, a hat comes down, she puts it on.
[10:06.22]Well, logically that can't happen because this is streaming on multiple platforms and only Twitch has the meter.
[10:11.34]Oh shit, this is actual gameplay.
[10:13.76]Oh, you know what I mean.
[10:16.44]I thought this was life.
[10:19.01]It looks so real.
[10:20.33]Did you ever play Stalker?
[10:23.77]Alright, we can do it movie theater style.
[10:26.59]Hey, dude.
[10:26.77]Did you ever play Stalker?
[10:27.41]Yeah, yeah.
[10:27.61]Who is that?
[10:27.85]Who is that guy, by the way?
[10:29.51]I was in the bathroom.
[10:31.97]What does that guy do?
[10:47.29]It's the same main character from Metro.
[10:50.02]Oh, okay.
[10:52.48]Hey, is your... Is your fucking seat all sticky?
[10:56.54]Hey, I've never... I've never played Stalker, but I think that from what I've seen, they're not really the kind of, like, run-and-run and have people miss their goal.
[11:05.27]Sorry.
[11:05.77]Sorry, the movie's too loud.
[11:06.75]Here it is.
[11:07.39]Okay.
[11:07.61]Okay.
[11:11.49]This really looks like Metro.
[11:14.37]This game's kind of fun, it really was.
[11:16.77]I've heard a lot of good things, but I haven't done it.
[11:38.43]I think you would actually like this game.
[11:40.77]I think I would too.
[11:42.35]I mean, like the whole series.
[11:43.25]I think I would too.
[11:48.63]I thought that was you talking, I don't know why, for some reason.
[11:53.94]No, hush, hush.
[12:07.63]They say you know where the base is.
[12:35.90]I was looking down at my water and I looked up and I thought that the model he was dancing with did not load in and they were freaking out behind the scenes.
[13:16.28]Don't know what.
[13:17.22]Actually looks kind of like a big pretty good.
[13:44.50]I just want to let you know and everyone listening know that I've decided so that we can have a totally neutral and unbiased review of E3 that I'm going to disagree with you on everything.
[13:58.27]You're going to disagree with me on everything?
[14:01.67]Yeah.
[14:02.43]This game looks like garbage.
[14:04.21]It was typically a slower paced tactical game and they've got people running around shooting, teleporting.
[14:10.98]No, Jerma's wrong.
[14:11.82]This one's bad.
[14:15.88]um it's actually like you Jerma what what I couldn't understand you
[14:37.83]you get into these like fits and you think people get it oh wait you don't oh wait wait wait is that guy in the left summit roll the tape back streamer reveal
[14:56.62]I gotta tell you what I did today.
[14:59.46]Is this why you were late?
[15:00.82]Yes.
[15:01.30]And it's fucking horrible.
[15:02.82]Listen to me.
[15:03.24]This is important.
[15:03.94]I wish I could pause E3.
[15:05.08]You know what I mean?
[15:05.92]We got stuff to talk about for the movie.
[15:08.42]So I was in a rush.
[15:10.06]And I fucked this more.
[15:12.42]It's just Left 4 Dead again.
[15:13.80]We've all played it before.
[15:15.04]Oh, okay.
[15:15.68]We've seen this.
[15:16.12]We all already know that Deep Rock Galactic is a better game.
[15:19.63]Just move on.
[15:22.61]So, before I got here, I just got a new deodorant, right?
[15:26.54]And I grabbed it.
[15:28.72]But without even thinking.
[15:30.18]It was brand new.
[15:31.96]I took the top off the deodorant.
[15:33.78]Because I was in a rush.
[15:34.60]Got out of the shower.
[15:35.28]I was like, I gotta fucking get there.
[15:36.16]I gotta get to the movie, right?
[15:37.38]And I ripped the top off and went... And scraped with the plastic shit still on it.
[15:42.63]It had, like, a plastic nub on it.
[15:44.57]And I caused, like, damage to the underarm here.
[15:47.41]It was like, gotta go, gotta go.
[15:48.89]And...
[15:51.33]It was horrible.
[15:51.95]I have like a cut there.
[15:53.73]It took me like five minutes to figure out what I was going to do.
[15:56.75]Okay, it took you five minutes and that's why you were 30 minutes late.
[16:03.10]Well, I cut my underarm.
[16:04.28]It hurt a lot.
[16:08.40]It was awful.
[16:09.08]It hurt a shitload.
[16:10.04]Alright, what do you think about this?
[16:16.07]I'm sorry to hear that.
[16:17.43]What do I think?
[16:18.81]I think what I said...
[16:22.26]I think that everyone has wanted a Left 4 Dead sequel for like 10 years and no one made it.
[16:28.52]And now that they've made it, it's outdated and other people have done it better.
[16:31.68]And you should really try Deep Rock Galactic if you haven't.
[16:35.41]Or personal favorite of EDS.
[16:40.31]No one gives EDS a chance.
[16:41.59]But they're all going to play Left 4 Dead again.
[16:46.76]EDF was fun, but EDF... I think that people just don't know what to do about multiplayer anymore.
[16:53.02]It's just like, I guess four of you have guns and shoot at people running at you.
[16:58.68]We've not evolved from the grab three of your buddies and shoot at people sprinting at you.
[17:04.12]I don't know how.
[17:04.70]How do we do that?
[17:07.78]Do you like... This is what I brought up last time.
[17:10.54]Last time they showed it at E3 for the first time, and everyone big disagreed because you got...
[17:15.65]I'm a hard person to agree with how do you feel about reloading guns personally where you stand on this I think it gives a pause for you to have to strategically make sure that you can it's it's a risk and reward okay so this is why we're good because we're neutrally balanced uh that I'm gonna disagree with you on everything
[17:34.95]Wait, we got all these zombies running towards you.
[17:36.71]Who wants to stop shooting them?
[17:38.11]That's why Doom was so good, and everyone loved Doom, because you could just jump around and keep shooting them.
[17:42.01]What is this?
[17:42.33]But the reload animations in these Left 4 Dead games are like, okay, you shoot for a second, reload for four.
[17:49.39]Can you two shut the fuck up back there?
[17:51.65]No one knows what we're looking at.
[17:54.52]You guys haven't stopped talking the whole movie.
[17:56.58]Next question.
[17:57.54]Do you think DMCA is real or made up?
[18:01.00]I think DMCA is made up?
[18:03.40]Yes.
[18:04.54]No, I don't.
[18:06.06]Well then, explain this.
[18:07.50]How come no streamers have been banned?
[18:12.97]I don't know, because everyone freaked out.
[18:15.59]They mute your stream.
[18:16.95]If you have, like, a portion of music, they will mute it.
[18:19.27]And now everyone's saying, I don't know, why are you fucking up my whole worldview?
[18:24.75]Well, you're listening to this popular song on your stream right now, nothing's gonna happen, right?
[18:30.39]Well, they have, like, they've suspended people.
[18:34.80]Who?
[18:35.46]Name a big streamer they've suspended.
[18:36.82]I don't know.
[18:37.14]I don't pay attention.
[18:37.90]Fuck!
[18:38.34]I'm... This is... I'm terrible at these.
[18:41.62]Okay.
[18:42.94]How did you hear about DMCA claims being an issue?
[18:47.64]Um... I saw, like, a Reddit thread that said, hey, like, they're cracking down.
[18:52.01]And then, like, Twitch came out with... Didn't Twitch come out with a thing that said that, like, hey, like, DMCA, we're cracking down?
[18:58.75]Who told me that?
[19:04.41]I feel like you're going nuts.
[19:07.46]I swear, no, no, dude, DMCA has been, my YouTube channel has been fucking striked before.
[19:13.26]Well, not striked, but like shit has been playing.
[19:15.00]What does that have to do with your Twitch stream?
[19:16.76]They mute it.
[19:17.44]They mute, if they mute Whole Forces of the Vaude.
[19:20.20]Here's the real question.
[19:21.52]Are you afraid of DMCA?
[19:24.18]I am not afraid of DMCA.
[19:25.99]I am afraid of having my magical voice muted during a goddamn live stream while I'm talking and listening to music.
[19:35.01]Well, it doesn't happen while you're talking.
[19:36.84]Yes, it does if there's music in the background.
[19:38.53]It mutes like 12 minutes of your stream.
[19:41.74]Yeah, and your VOD, which isn't while you're talking.
[19:44.28]No one watches the VOD.
[19:45.40]They might do that shit.
[19:46.30]You never know.
[19:46.90]Who knows?
[19:47.40]Yeah, but on OBS now, you can have your VOD saved with a different track than the one that you streamed with.
[19:53.12]Hold on a minute.
[19:53.88]Stop talking.
[19:54.30]Stop talking.
[19:54.62]This is very important.
[19:55.28]That was just Johnny Depp.
[19:56.82]Dude, okay, it is.
[19:57.80]Okay, you're right, actually.
[19:58.60]This is Johnny Depp.
[20:00.00]You remember the first time they showed Sea of Thieves at E3 and we were both like, this is the fucking game.
[20:05.05]This is the game changer.
[20:08.25]I'm trying to watch.
[20:10.03]Okay, I guess I'm trying to member over here.
[20:14.71]All I can do is show you the way.
[20:17.49]From what I hear of the so-called Sea of Thieves, it's nothing but cursed crews, bloodthirsty mermaids, a legion of dead, angry pirates.
[20:30.34]Ah, yes.
[20:31.36]And now, one David Jones.
[20:40.25]Well, I believe that now is the perfect time to use these cannons.
[20:46.86]This is perfect.
[20:47.52]I've never seen a Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
[21:01.33]Oh, but the reason why this is perfect is because the latest Johnny Depp Jack Sparrow shit is like Johnny Depp pretending to be Jack Sparrow.
[21:09.49]It's kind of gotten that far.
[21:10.65]So now, like, he's CG, so they're even pretending that the actor is a real person, too.
[21:17.98]Did you see the first day where, what's his name, Jeff Goldblum came on to announce Jurassic Park?
[21:25.60]Bring me that horizon.
[21:27.38]No, it's worth going back to watch.
[21:29.52]I swear he came back and did a parody of himself to make fun of everyone who wanted him to do it.
[21:35.44]It was really great.
[21:37.98]Alright.
[21:38.66]What's um... Alright.
[21:43.10]Johnny Depp.
[21:47.70]Now available.
[21:48.72]Should I get Xbox Game Pass?
[21:50.22]I feel like it's going to be worth it at some point soon.
[21:51.78]Do you have a computer?
[21:56.25]yeah but so okay do you have um I don't know tens of thousands of viewers I mean is your uh purchasing of games of deductible and taxes sometimes yeah I don't think game pass is really gonna help
[22:19.00]Okay, here's the real final question.
[22:21.16]I'm sorry, last one.
[22:23.38]Are you going to play a game made later than 1980?
[22:26.16]Oh, there's people in like diapers on the screen.
[22:32.36]What Yakuza is this and why have I not played it yet?
[22:35.62]I want to play this one.
[22:36.86]You would actually love them.
[22:38.83]I played Yakuza 0.
[22:43.69]Why would anyone want me to play the first one?
[22:46.49]Zero.
[22:46.81]Why wouldn't I play that one?
[22:51.45]Free alpha gameplay.
[23:02.69]Are you sick of the... Or do you think it's cool?
[23:09.64]I'm a huge fan of the... In... What was the name of that movie?
[23:15.02]District 9.
[23:16.97]That was a really good...
[23:20.32]but like cinematic trailer, no, yeah, I think I'm kind of over it.
[23:24.51]I'm actually kind of, let's watch.
[23:57.10]Oh, KomodoHype.
[23:59.68]Shut up.
[24:01.33]Let's get some talk champs in the chat.
[24:03.75]Oh, it actually is on the screen.
[24:06.13]Why are they doing this?
[24:07.11]Isn't this like ruining the trailer for everybody that wants to not listen to two dickheads talk over it?
[24:14.90]Yeah.
[24:17.54]Let's see some... It's like, hey, I'm watching this.
[24:41.83]I have a confession to make after this trailer is over, too, about how I play Battlefield whenever I've played it.
[24:45.69]Okay.
[24:51.15]I've never killed one person in one game of Battlefield.
[24:53.50]I don't think once.
[24:55.54]Once.
[24:56.04]No, I just kind of walk around and shoot the, like, weapon at stuff in the air.
[25:00.38]Like, my assault rifle and stuff at planes and stuff, and I pretend like I'm playing.
[25:03.76]And I just revive people, and then I don't ever play the game again.
[25:07.44]And then people stop inviting me to play.
[25:15.99]Um, I, I, mine is actually a little bit similar is I find like a really tall hill and I lay on top of the hill and I just kind of watch the battle and every one minute I take a shot and like pretend I'm like sniping and like I feel cool.
[25:33.24]I don't hit anybody though.
[25:34.23]So I, same, I have not killed anyone.
[25:36.13]So you play Battlefield as an idle game?
[25:38.58]well yeah like me and my friends we we do a full squad and all four of us are on different hills just looking for other people on hills but nobody really ever gets a shot in also are we still in the previews your day oh you know I have something to share what these are these are games I know but like has phil come out and talk to you arrest for your father's murder eight years ago
[25:59.45]Todd was out talking.
[26:00.77]Oh, this is not even Xbox.
[26:03.29]This is Bethesda.
[26:04.41]Yeah, they're doing a co- a group thing.
[26:05.77]I see.
[26:07.16]I see.
[26:34.33]Yeah, but I feel like this is what I worry about.
[26:38.43]You know, last day you're like, hey, let's watch on the last day.
[26:41.96]You've already seen all of these already.
[26:43.50]I haven't seen anything.
[26:45.94]I'm waiting for Elden Ring.
[26:47.22]You have not heard that like Psychonauts 2 is a thing.
[26:50.30]Yeah, but it's closer to being released.
[26:53.96]Time for justice.
[27:02.11]Alright.
[27:03.55]There's three or four new clips in here.
[27:05.41]Alright.
[27:05.61]Is Psychonauts actually fun?
[27:07.43]You know, I ask this question every single time this trailer shows.
[27:30.95]Have you ever played it?
[27:32.34]Nope.
[27:35.02]This is a mission about the fate of the world.
[27:39.12]Probably more fun than like cleaning a dirty fence.
[27:43.79]I don't know about that.
[27:44.71]Going to ignore that last part.
[27:47.67]This game might have too many buttons for you.
[27:49.31]You think so?
[27:51.84]Yeah.
[28:02.76]We're getting just bang, bang, reveal, reveal, reveal.
[28:10.72]This is usually the moment when I say hello and welcome to the Bethesda E3 showcase.
[28:15.40]We love that we can share the stage with Xbox this year.
[28:18.35]And whether you've known Bethesda for 35 years or are just getting to know us.
[28:22.05]35?
[28:22.25]We're happier to bring you the latest on your favorite games.
[28:25.51]35 what?
[28:26.17]That's how old I am.
[28:27.27]My good friend Todd Howard, who gave you a first look at Starfield.
[28:31.07]Along with Bethesda Game Studios, all of our teams are continuing to work on the projects.
[28:35.32]That's when you're like patting me on the back and you're like, good, good job, Jeremy.
[28:39.28]Yep, that's how old you are.
[28:40.94]Yes, I'm 35.
[28:41.24]I'm two years old.
[28:42.34]I don't know how old you are.
[28:43.64]I don't know why we're talking.
[28:44.68]What?
[28:44.98]And today, we're bringing 10 more titles to Game Pass for a total of 30 Bethesda games.
[28:50.15]You know how old you are, Jeremy.
[28:51.71]You're three.
[28:52.47]Yes, I'm three.
[28:53.43]The award-winning DOOM Eternal.
[28:55.75]If you're looking for another reason to play it, DOOM Eternal will be optimized.
[28:59.03]Did you play Doom?
[29:00.84]No.
[29:01.82]Oh, that's why you think reloading is essential.
[29:06.03]But not every single game has to have no reloads.
[29:09.61]Why not?
[29:12.05]Because then every game becomes like the zombie game.
[29:14.97]Every game becomes the two choices that you have to make.
[29:18.87]Oh, which one?
[29:19.67]Who lives and who dies, right?
[29:21.51]I don't want to do that.
[29:23.03]I want everything to be different.
[29:25.51]What?
[29:27.71]You were just complaining about how every game is the same game.
[29:29.93]When was I complaining about that?
[29:31.87]You said, wait, it was the very beginning.
[29:33.55]What?
[29:34.51]Right at the beginning of the stream, you said... No, I said it, and then you agreed.
[29:37.92]I said, man, oh, what's with all these Left 4 Dead clones?
[29:40.72]You show four people, they shoot at zombies.
[29:43.32]No, what I said was that there's a better version of Left 4 Dead, and you should just play the best version of each genre, and that is Deep Rock Galactic, and it's not even debatable.
[29:53.19]Everyone who plays this game knows this.
[29:55.31]This is just true.
[29:56.51]I forgot our whole conversation already.
[29:58.97]I have to be honest.
[29:59.65]I'm just winging it here.
[30:01.17]Alright, what is this?
[30:06.81]Fallout 76.
[30:14.85]Do you think they're ever going to Diablo 3 this game?
[30:16.96]And they'll come out with Reaper's Souls and people it'll be actually kind of fun.
[30:21.96]I think people are enjoying it that still play it.
[30:27.70]But no one who had the initial impression that they think it's bad is ever going to go back and like try it again.
[30:35.58]And it would take years for like a whole new generation of people to just forget what it was like when they launched it People saying it's kind of fun Yeah, I've honestly not been hearing bad things about it what the launch was, you know One of the worst I thought you understood what that insignia meant You are no paladin of the brotherhood
[31:02.32]Some people like CBT, too.
[31:09.82]I'm surprised that's the kind of comment you would read.
[31:14.75]Well, it looks like you don't know me very well, do you?
[31:17.45]I guess I don't.
[31:17.93]I haven't been watching the stream lately.
[31:19.85]I don't know.
[31:20.39]Do you talk about CBT often?
[31:22.06]I might join in.
[31:23.51]No, I thought CBT was a time zone when people started spamming it like a year ago.
[31:27.39]Oh, really?
[31:28.25]I see.
[31:28.91]I thought it was like central British time.
[31:31.08]That makes a lot more sense.
[31:36.32]Yeah, never mind.
[31:36.94]I'm not joining now.
[31:43.14]What the hell was that?
[31:46.25]Expedition Squad Delta, report over.
[31:49.85]Squad Delta, what's going on out there?
[31:52.47]Is this a fallout?
[32:14.70]I would take 30 less trash cans on the screen for this to run at 60 FPS.
[32:20.91]And everyone else agree with that?
[32:23.09]Big agree.
[32:24.09]Bethesda games always actually have that mod.
[32:30.44]Wait, no, I'm not supposed to be agreeing with you.
[32:32.57]I think the graphical fidelity is worth the loss of frames because I can't see over 24 anyway.
[32:37.97]This is still going?
[32:38.49]I feel like the whole Bethesda conference has me been going, they're still working on this?
[32:44.27]This is still a game?
[32:44.91]They haven't liquidated this whole franchise?
[32:46.23]That's what I've been saying the whole time.
[33:00.24]I have heard.
[33:01.02]No, wait, that's... That's Final Fantasy.
[33:02.92]Was this the mobile one?
[33:03.86]No, this is not the mobile one.
[33:05.06]Yeah, this looks like a mobile game.
[33:07.63]You tell them.
[33:24.72]No, no, no.
[33:27.01]Elder Scrolls Online.
[33:28.87]That was the console one.
[33:30.81]It came out on console, right?
[33:32.91]That was a big deal.
[33:33.85]What?
[33:34.09]It came out on console.
[33:35.23]That was a big deal that it came out on console.
[33:40.46]Right?
[33:41.20]A big deal that an Elder Scrolls game came out on a console.
[33:44.44]It's an MMO.
[33:45.34]It was like an MMO that came out on console.
[33:47.36]I'm going to ask again.
[33:48.38]Are you going to play any games that have come out after 1980s?
[33:54.83]Why is everybody question-marking me?
[33:55.95]What am I talking about?
[34:00.91]When this first came out, wasn't it on console?
[34:03.25]And that was like, oh my god, an MMO on console?
[34:05.78]No way!
[34:11.28]Yes.
[34:11.74]Yeah, it was.
[34:12.98]That was Final Fantasy XIV.
[34:17.10]Remember, you're wrong.
[34:17.78]Stop.
[34:18.70]That was Final Fantasy XIV?
[34:25.17]I mean like one guy might have said that.
[34:26.89]I don't know if it was a thing.
[34:30.84]I thought that was a big deal.
[34:32.78]Oh shit, wait.
[34:33.34]Fall Guys?
[34:33.86]Have they added?
[34:36.42]No, I'm not going to be mean.
[34:46.31]This is not Fall Guys.
[34:48.79]Yeah.
[34:50.57]If you want to, like, when you say you don't want to be mean, if, like, a game comes up and you don't like it, but you don't want to be the one to say it, just ask me what I think about it.
[34:58.05]You want me to just send you, like, a Discord message every time I want to say something mean, and you'll just say it?
[35:01.61]No, no, just ask me what do you think about this, and then I'll say it.
[35:07.80]Okay.
[35:11.50]I don't have a filter.
[35:15.26]Hold on, this actually kind of looks fun.
[35:19.12]Is this that, remember that game, Gang Beasts?
[35:21.40]I'm pretty sure this is like Gang Beasts 2, yeah.
[35:23.52]Is it?
[35:24.07]Yeah.
[35:24.31]This looks like it could be kind of fun.
[35:30.45]Oh shit, this looks really fun.
[35:36.37]Well, not actually, but yeah, it just looks like Gang Beasts.
[35:39.16]Imagine if they were Kirby and Star!
[35:41.14]Imagine if it was us!
[35:43.10]That actually looks kind of fun.
[36:00.49]Hey, play this game.
[36:02.53]Wait, hold on.
[36:04.16]Before I say anything, I want to know how you felt about this game.
[36:11.04]I felt that... Okay, now go.
[36:13.08]I just want to make sure I was ready.
[36:15.71]Okay, wait.
[36:17.57]Why do you need to be ready?
[36:18.57]Because I just need to be ready.
[36:21.27]Are you capturing my soul?
[36:24.83]Let's hear your thoughts.
[36:25.81]I want to hear.
[36:26.96]My thoughts on Hades...
[36:28.99]are that I'm really sick and tired of roguelite games requiring you to lose multiple times, claiming that it's because their game is hard, rather than just that they're gating you from being to accessing the things you need to actually win the game from the start.
[36:44.08]You know, we go back to the back in the day gamers who played fucking Binding of Isaac.
[36:47.95]You could just go beat mom.
[36:49.15]Like, what's the big deal?
[36:50.39]But nowadays, Hades is like, you got to play for a couple of hours before you can do plus 300% damage and double your health.
[36:57.61]What?
[36:58.51]Why?
[37:00.81]sorry I didn't listen um essentially that was my game of the year last year how dare you first of all and second of all was it yeah I think it's a good game except for the first part where you need to unlock things here's here's the better example I think Hades is encouraging the trend have you played the last spell no the last spell is a tower defense roguelike
[37:31.08]But here's the catch.
[37:32.96]You can't actually build towers until you've lost a few times.
[37:38.00]You'd be a horrible boss to work for, I think.
[37:41.86]Why?
[37:44.61]Somebody would come to you with a concept of like a thing that they were making.
[37:47.37]You'd be like, Nope.
[37:51.55]Redo it.
[37:53.87]And then they would redo it like a hundred times.
[37:57.56]And then you would have already moved on to another project.
[38:02.44]Um, well, I feel like I'm giving, I feel like I'm giving actual reasons and not just, I'm not just telling them, no, try again.
[38:09.94]I feel like I would, I would offer some form of guidance.
[38:14.27]But then you would have the perfect thing.
[38:19.97]What's your favorite game of all time?
[38:23.69]Uh, Diablo II.
[38:24.83]Okay.
[38:27.33]We can agree on that.
[38:29.90]well you're not supposed to be agreeing right now this holiday marks the 20th anniversary uh Master Chief is back there the 20th anniversary of halo to our millions of passionate fans thank you we wouldn't be here without all of you our goal has always been to bring players together and for the first time we're thrilled to offer our entire
[38:53.68]Why am I quiet right now?
[38:56.08]Like we should be talking.
[38:57.76]You said quiet.
[38:58.74]There's Halo.
[38:59.44]I know, but they didn't... And then you waited 20 seconds and said, why are we quiet?
[39:03.20]What's the last Halo you played?
[39:16.95]uh me and me and Joel our skeleton we played on legendary the remake remaster one for 40 minutes and it's the only time I've ever played it I watched people play it when I was like 20. halo 2. I've never played a halo game heroism and wonder about fighting to keep humanity I played halo 2. impossible odds in a beautiful and mysterious sci-fi world
[39:43.19]I don't know.
[39:43.47]It just never grabbed me for some reason.
[39:44.95]I don't know why.
[39:47.81]Is it the reloading?
[39:49.86]I'm kidding.
[39:51.96]I'm kidding.
[39:52.48]God.
[39:53.48]Wait, do you reload in Halo?
[39:54.76]Yeah, you do.
[39:55.82]Of course you do.
[39:56.52]You shoot your battle rifle twice and then you reload.
[39:58.95]I mean, this is a huge deal, right?
[40:04.47]This is the new Halo.
[40:05.11]Yeah.
[40:05.23]I'm very excited.
[40:05.67]I was thinking about doing the puke thing.
[40:07.33]I was thinking about going... But I was like, I don't want to do that right now.
[40:11.89]People are trying to watch.
[40:33.15]you know what I like about Master Chief is he kills relentlessly but also it's clear that he cares what can you do on your own I told you it's enough okay imagine if he like landed on his like head I need you to understand
[41:02.83]That's all.
[41:03.13]That's it.
[41:04.09]That's all I have.
[41:07.71]That's it.
[41:11.53]It's too early.
[41:12.15]See what I need?
[41:18.20]Hey, you know how cool of a boss I would be?
[41:23.41]How cool of a boss would you be, Jerma?
[41:25.99]You'd come into my office and there would be like a transparent cup that has levels of like up here there's a line that says, don't even think about talking to me.
[41:35.80]And then when the line is here and the coffee's here, it's like, maybe listening.
[41:39.66]And then when it's down here, the line right here, it's like, now's time for you to talk.
[41:45.38]That's how you know I'd be a cool boss.
[41:49.08]Yours were to take her back to the infinity for deletion.
[41:52.89]so if it wasn't you okay then okay I don't know how to react to this on successful deployment my deletion routine was supposed to complete still here good good something stopped your deletion we need to is that cortana or a new hollow girl
[42:18.95]This wasn't just people.
[42:20.53]This is people are getting furious with us if we start.
[42:22.91]We don't stop talking right now.
[42:24.00]Sure.
[42:24.58]No gameplay.
[42:25.28]No, bye.
[42:25.88]Stop talking.
[42:40.87]Of course, you can't have a Halo game without multiplayer.
[42:44.83]And on Xbox Series X, you'll be able to enjoy Infinite's multiplayer action at up to 120 frames per second.
[42:51.92]Finally, I'm very happy to announce that Halo Infinite's first free-to-play multiplayer season and Infinite's story-driven campaign will launch together this holiday.
[43:03.10]A new day is upon us.
[43:05.95]Yeah, dude, this is Halo.
[43:08.13]I just gotta let you know, people are sitting at their table right now, and they are contemplating whether to give this restaurant of our stream like a two-star review.
[43:18.09]We're getting there.
[43:18.81]I was letting you know.
[43:19.53]We have to be careful here.
[43:21.03]I just want to let that person know that they're sitting in a virtual restaurant, and the only thing stopping them from going to a better restaurant, they don't even have to stand up.
[43:31.02]They just click the special events where it says that under the stream and then like there's a whole bunch of options.
[43:37.06]You can just change the restaurant you're in.
[43:39.62]Yeah.
[43:40.94]You're sitting at like a fucking Denny's or something and you're just like, you know what?
[43:45.44]I'm really not into this French toast grilled cheese they just gave me.
[43:50.36]I'm not in Applebee's.
[43:52.10]You just teleport into the seat?
[43:54.69]Yeah.
[43:55.01]So like they put down the pancakes in front of you at Denny's and you're like, ah, these don't look that good.
[43:58.93]You just, you switch, you switch the channel and there's a new tray of food in front of you already.
[44:08.66]But do you have to pay?
[44:10.04]You would have to pay, right?
[44:10.84]Return it to base.
[44:12.79]Not... No.
[44:14.75]No.
[44:14.95]What do you mean, no?
[44:16.29]So what's stopping somebody from just going... What about the trolls that would just jump from restaurant to restaurant and order everything on the menu and just jump... The galaxy jump to the next restaurant?
[44:25.36]The customer is always right.
[44:27.42]Oh.
[44:28.90]Right.
[44:35.05]The flag is ours.
[44:38.29]Someone just wrote in all capitals, why are they talking?
[44:41.25]I would probably like Halo 2's multiplayer.
[45:01.82]It always looked really fun to me.
[45:08.38]Well, it's free to play, so you're definitely going to try it out, right?
[45:10.58]I don't know.
[45:13.04]That one looked always the most fun.
[45:18.21]What about it?
[45:18.67]I don't know.
[45:19.73]Just driving the cars around, running over people.
[45:22.21]Oh, you can't do that in 3?
[45:23.93]But it just seemed cleaner.
[45:25.13]It seemed more fun.
[45:25.83]I don't know.
[45:27.03]I've seen 3.
[45:27.37]Shut up!
[45:29.03]I'm serious.
[45:32.28]You're talking over Elden Ring right now, dude.
[45:33.80]I'm serious.
[45:34.08]Stop talking.
[45:34.60]This is why I'm here.
[45:37.32]This is Diablo.
[45:38.06]I know!
[45:38.32]Dude.
[45:38.58]Game of the year.
[45:39.48]It's my fucking, like, I'm ready.
[46:06.81]Are you not excited for this?
[46:07.87]I heard it's very good.
[46:14.78]I even have mixed feelings about my game of the year joke.
[46:22.65]I mean, it looks great.
[46:23.82]It's actually, it's so close one-to-one to the actual Diablo II that the bugs that Diablo II has that like speedruns use, it kept everything.
[46:33.54]Even like really weirdly obscure mechanical things.
[46:36.78]Really?
[46:37.12]So it's like as authentic of a remaster as you could possibly get.
[46:41.15]Because this is, I've wanted this for a decade and a half at least.
[46:50.67]Yeah.
[46:53.25]Well, see, my only mixed feeling is that I never stopped playing Diablo II.
[46:56.94]So, like, a graphical update doesn't even... But don't you think... This is important to remember here.
[47:03.72]Don't you think that having a Diablo II on the Blizzard launcher means we'll get interesting updates to the game?
[47:15.33]No.
[47:15.79]You don't think they'll add stuff to it?
[47:17.19]Like, items, potentially?
[47:18.29]I really doubt they would add things to it, because I feel like whenever you add things to a remaster, the purists start complaining.
[47:25.53]and then you you're afraid even like even patches though even stuff that like people have been begging for well that's what I mean is that they have bugs from Diablo II are remastered to be authentically bugged like still so if they're not patching that they're not gonna what is happening on this stream I don't know is this is this is this me or is this the no this is the stream but he's my brother
[47:52.51]And I would remaster bug.
[47:55.91]This is not Diablo.
[47:57.71]It just got louder.
[48:00.19]Yes, it was kind of freaking out.
[48:01.81]Why is this?
[48:02.41]This got like 30% louder.
[48:13.04]My only concern with Diablo II remastered is that Diablo II has a whole bunch of mods and I hope that Blizzard doesn't restrict
[48:21.56]mods being able to make be made of the remaster because otherwise to me like actual Diablo II is still just going to be better Ster shut up Ster shut dude this game came out like two years ago it's a new game cinematics no gameplay no buy
[48:48.79]You have a bunch of policies, apparently, that I didn't know about.
[48:52.08]I have a lot of policies.
[48:53.50]No gameplay, no buy, no chatter left behind.
[48:58.80]Can we have one trailer where we don't talk?
[49:01.08]Just one.
[49:01.90]This one.
[49:02.30]Okay, ready?
[49:02.62]This is like the fourth time they've shown this game.
[49:05.40]Let's just see if we can do it.
[49:07.21]But if we're going to do it, why this game?
[49:11.51]Okay, okay.
[49:13.61]I recognize that voice.
[49:15.85]Let me ask you a question.
[49:18.34]When I am dead and Yara is burning, what exactly is your plan?
[49:23.86]Hold hands, sing songs around the fire?
[49:27.61]Sure, I know just the song.
[49:33.03]The time you learn about resolver, daddy.
[49:36.59]You fucking ruined it.
[49:37.55]It's over.
[49:38.03]It was a trailer of reloading guns.
[49:39.65]I'm out.
[49:39.95]No reloading.
[49:44.69]Taking out a high-value target I have just what you need I
[50:15.90]You want to blow shit up?
[50:17.48]Juan Cortez at your service.
[50:31.02]Somebody said NBC comedy intro trailer.
[50:36.71]Like the music.
[50:37.51]I was going to say this music is a little... Oh, yeah.
[50:49.89]you know that they're killing people whatever happened in games where we honor the death of the fallen I want to play with that crazy backpack
[51:02.47]No, this is worse.
[51:03.25]This is like an NBC compilation of all their comedy trailers.
[51:08.01]And Michael walks out just like, it's happening!
[51:10.39]It's happening!
[51:11.89]Is Ubisoft really going to make Light of Revolution?
[51:16.47]I like how you resolve that, Juan.
[51:20.27]So do I. This is fun.
[51:27.34]This is a lot of fun.
[51:27.90]Alright, don't talk.
[51:36.58]If I called it from the clouds, I'm going to keep talking.
[51:38.66]I'll do drag knock online.
[51:47.77]Somebody said slime rancher devs.
[51:49.71]Are you shitting me?
[51:54.24]I want reaction for this one.
[52:29.59]Alright, I want reaction for this one, go.
[52:31.25]NOOOOO!
[52:34.59]I'm sorry it's too early for that shit.
[52:41.43]Alright, uh, Slime Rancher was awesome.
[52:43.47]Did you play Slime Rancher?
[52:45.07]Yeah.
[52:46.49]I lo- that would've been my game of the year if I played it when it was actually relevant.
[52:51.96]Back in like 2017 or something, right?
[52:54.23]Yeah, I think I played it too early.
[52:55.65]I never played like the release version.
[52:57.37]I loved it.
[52:57.93]There wasn't much content when I played it, but it was very good.
[53:00.37]I'm actually really excited for that.
[53:01.79]I love that game, so let's see.
[53:14.96]How you liking this?
[53:18.72]It's been a while since we had a real good snowboarding game, right?
[53:37.26]Oh, Steep.
[53:37.76]Yeah, Steep.
[53:38.20]But Steep was a... Steep was more than a snowboarding game.
[53:43.33]It was a wingsuit game.
[53:46.67]I guess you could count that, though.
[53:55.90]I get the appeal of snowboarding games and games like this, but I just can't play them.
[54:00.18]Because I end up trying to do a backflip for too long and don't land the third backflip.
[54:04.39]You know what I mean?
[54:07.19]I get way too overzealous with the tricks in the snowboarding game, and I just fall down every time.
[54:11.95]Why don't you just like, just like slowly go down the hill and just enjoy the path?
[54:16.39]Shredders.
[54:17.01]Okay, this is good.
[54:18.99]This is good.
[54:19.43]This is really good.
[54:20.76]Holy fluttering whip whoops.
[54:23.18]You actually get to do that?
[54:24.04]That'd be actually kind of fun.
[54:25.38]If you could be the camera guy.
[54:29.10]Okay, write that one down.
[54:30.66]I'm serious.
[54:32.30]Writing it down.
[54:33.25]Because if you can be the camera guy, then I need to play that.
[54:44.52]Atomic Heart.
[54:47.14]I feel like Atomic Heart is going to be Cyberpunk 2077 without all of the hype.
[54:55.03]It might be better.
[55:08.34]Though this trailer is pretty weird.
[55:13.71]What is this song?
[55:14.91]Is it getting you pumped?
[55:20.84]I mean, kinda.
[55:25.20]That was 80s Russian pop.
[55:36.07]What was that?
[55:36.71]I'm kind of curious about what that was.
[55:48.80]oh hype meter pog meter just filled up to 100 I don't have a pog meter haven't you made this tweet before where you're like I'm you're one of those people that say you are sick of games that have pixels in them um
[56:14.92]Did I?
[56:16.18]I feel like you've been there.
[56:18.90]Maybe.
[56:19.18]Because I was shocked that you would have one of the lowest forms of opinion.
[56:26.12]I think pixel art, if done well, pixel art can be... I think it's like it has a big range.
[56:34.17]Yeah, it's almost like you can arrange pixels and do a lot of different things with them.
[56:38.33]I mean, this is gorgeous, let me just say.
[56:39.65]Okay?
[56:45.08]There's a range in pixel art.
[56:59.45]I'm very interested.
[57:00.73]Quiet.
[57:20.69]Write that one down too.
[57:23.26]Oh, okay.
[57:24.92]Am I actually?
[57:25.60]I didn't write down the last one.
[57:27.76]I don't even remember what the last one was.
[57:29.50]Why didn't you not write it down?
[57:30.76]I'll write this one down.
[57:32.76]What was the other one?
[57:33.28]I don't remember.
[57:34.13]It was a snowboard game.
[57:36.25]No, it wasn't.
[57:37.55]Yeah, it was.
[57:37.83]The one I told you to write down was a snowboard game.
[57:41.22]In the first year of Grounded, millions of players kept busy with crafting.
[57:51.04]Did they say billions of players?
[57:52.72]Fighting.
[57:56.09]The pond.
[57:58.25]Ziplining.
[58:00.01]Billions.
[58:04.39]to celebrate we present the shroom and doom update it gives the to celebrate everyone at birth getting an account tied to their id man that's what happens when you listen to community feedback hats for when you get sick of your human companions and of course mushrooms but not those guys
[58:30.24]Why have I never even heard of this?
[58:33.07]Go big.
[58:57.56]Or never go home.
[59:04.05]Oh, honey, I shrunk the kids.
[59:05.29]Oh, and it looks like we added achievements too.
[59:07.87]Nice.
[59:08.73]Okay, I'm writing this one down.
[59:11.77]Among us.
[59:12.49]I want to say this is what Jerma sees every day.
[59:16.83]Okay.
[59:20.37]Among us too.
[59:22.61]Enter the sus guy.
[59:34.22]Alright, somebody take a screenshot of this so I can pretend like I played it.
[59:39.71]Is that important?
[59:41.93]So you can prove that I was in a different clothing.
[59:43.67]I just threw my back out.
[59:45.37]I just literally pulled a muscle in my back.
[59:48.63]I'm worried about you.
[59:52.05]It feels like if you move, you hurt yourself.
[59:54.27]Ow, I just pulled a muscle down the left side of my back.
[59:58.61]You hurt yourself putting on deodorant?
[60:01.23]Fuck, that was stupid.
[60:05.66]Do the face.
[60:07.32]No.
[60:11.83]God damn, I need to drink some more water.
[60:13.53]I got water right here.
[60:14.37]Yeah, I don't know what's happening right now.
[60:19.25]No gameplay, no bye-bye.
[60:26.22]What is it?
[60:26.50]I don't know.
[60:30.88]His stories will be...
[60:48.73]It's like this 2D, 3D thing.
[60:49.93]It's kind of cool looking though.
[60:53.05]Why am I doing that without using a fucking microphone?
[60:55.91]Oops, yeah.
[60:59.01]That's fine.
[61:07.18]And?
[61:09.14]I don't know.
[61:13.38]I don't have a reaction point.
[61:16.46]Wait, how did you see that before I did?
[61:19.79]I thought you were saying, and what's your reaction, Jeremy?
[61:22.53]I didn't know that.
[61:23.45]No, I have the paid for stream.
[61:26.36]You actually had me?
[61:26.86]We did it five seconds in advance.
[61:27.90]Yeah.
[61:29.58]Am I actually like 10 seconds behind?
[61:32.92]You could try refreshing.
[61:33.90]I feel like that's a bad idea.
[61:36.46]You have shown an aptitude for applying lethal solutions to conflicted situations.
[61:40.67]Did you just refresh my stream?
[61:42.23]What the fuck's happening?
[61:43.37]Oh, what?
[61:51.93]It was like binaural audio.
[61:54.98]Yeah, I feel completely complicit and I love the government now.
[62:00.38]That's the shit you listen to when, like, you really want to go to bed before a big event that you're really, really excited for, like the first ever PAX of being a content creator, and you couldn't fucking fall asleep.
[62:09.73]It was 4 or 5 or 6 AM, and you had to be up at 11, and you just put on binaural beats in both ears, fucking so pissed off that you can't go to bed, and you're just, please fucking work so I can be going like a content creator now.
[62:21.85]It didn't work.
[62:31.82]I mean, I want to throw up question marks, but a lot of people are plus twoing you.
[62:42.47]I just turned off the webcam right when I spilled coffee all over me.
[62:45.56]It just went all over me.
[62:57.58]You need to live in like in a home.
[63:00.32]You know what I mean?
[63:00.82]I'm fine, OK?
[63:04.86]What will you be remembered for?
[63:07.72]Nurse, I failed another nurse.
[63:17.39]I'm fine.
[63:29.45]Yeah, I don't know about this game.
[63:31.00]I'm kind of bored of games taking place like on Earth.
[63:36.56]You know what I mean?
[63:38.99]Like, the entire universe is boring you, so I think I'm just going to be the opposite again and say, like, any game that takes place on a planet is just, I think, a little overdone.
[63:49.60]I think we're just too spoiled.
[63:50.78]You know what I mean?
[63:52.88]Like, there's been so many video games in the last two or three decades that all some of them have been so good that it's just, like, outer galactic exploration.
[64:01.37]Yeah.
[64:02.05]We both hate this one, too, because this is a planet in space, so, like, I'm over it.
[64:09.21]Suddenly, and for no reason, we added combat goons to our game.
[64:11.39]We needed shooting.
[64:14.55]I was intrigued until a moment ago.
[64:35.16]But we talked about this last year.
[64:38.21]Constant conflict.
[64:41.35]It has to be constant conflict.
[64:43.37]I think I'm being parodied.
[64:44.37]Yes.
[64:58.15]But only their silhouette, because the developers haven't finished the design, or finished the story, or finished any gameplay that's actually ready to show.
[65:09.97]In fact, the only thing they have finished is the title.
[65:16.34]Wait, really?
[65:24.60]Why?
[65:32.66]No gameplay, no buy.
[65:34.68]I played through the whole first one.
[65:37.54]It was... It was okay.
[65:40.50]It was fun.
[65:41.62]I mean, we're getting a two... I feel like they have... Isn't it DLC that they're still making for the first one?
[65:47.23]I don't know.
[66:00.12]Yeah, they are.
[66:00.60]Yep, they are.
[66:01.30]That's what I mean.
[66:02.20]Like, it seems really close to having a second one.
[66:16.46]I also feel like you would probably like Flight Simulator.
[66:22.63]You kind of really don't do much.
[66:26.03]Like a one-button kind of game.
[66:27.57]What's that supposed to mean?
[66:29.93]This just seems like the game that you seem to like.
[66:36.35]Like those Euro Truck simulators too, you'd probably really enjoy.
[66:41.06]Earth game, ResidentSleeper Earth game.
[66:46.87]Yeah.
[66:48.63]Oh.
[66:59.04]Constant conflict, right?
[67:01.00]Yeah, these planes are in constant... They're in competition to get there.
[67:03.68]Did you see how many there were?
[67:13.21]I don't know.
[67:13.81]I was honestly curious about your opinion on why you would or would not like this, and I feel like you just deflected.
[67:18.37]I would probably like it.
[67:20.37]I'm not saying I wouldn't.
[67:23.29]When it came out, I just don't think I had a good enough graphics card to be able to play it.
[67:34.88]Oh, is this Top Gun?
[67:42.45]Actually might be.
[67:55.14]There wasn't advertisement for Top Gun.
[68:00.82]Do me a favor.
[68:01.60]Do me a favor.
[68:02.13]Hit pause on your stream.
[68:03.85]No!
[68:04.31]You refresh!
[68:05.25]Just do it.
[68:05.53]Just do it.
[68:05.87]Please do it.
[68:06.21]Ready?
[68:06.79]Pause.
[68:07.11]Pause.
[68:07.27]Ready?
[68:07.79]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[68:12.73]No, I'm back.
[68:13.37]You were not that far behind me.
[68:15.99]I was.
[68:16.29]I was.
[68:16.65]I really was.
[68:17.91]Can we both just press refresh at the same time?
[68:21.65]I'm capturing the browser.
[68:24.65]Alright.
[68:24.95]Tell me what you see.
[68:26.05]So am I. Rain.
[68:28.33]I see cactuses.
[68:31.67]I see rocks.
[68:33.37]Grass.
[68:34.15]A car.
[68:35.73]You see, how do you see a car?
[68:37.53]Oh, I'm pausing for like, you're so far behind.
[68:39.88]You are so far.
[68:40.78]Alright.
[68:41.54]How do I refresh this?
[68:43.54]F5 on all browsers.
[68:45.26]But I'm not, I'm not, I'm capturing the actual like embedded.
[68:48.26]Oh, that's what you mean.
[68:49.16]Yeah, no, then I just paused more.
[68:50.08]I'm not giving up.
[68:51.46]Come on, we got nothing left to lose.
[68:58.81]when the splash screen comes up that says like the name of the game like car driver atlantic tell me okay low latency mode I do have low latency mode on yeah alright so the Jeep just went through the outdoor car wash just getting on the road doing things that are going to get us absolutely arrested pulled over illegal what else that's the whole trailer
[69:30.58]I think I'm behind you now.
[69:31.52]Wait, hold on.
[69:32.46]We'll find out.
[69:39.75]Inside the car.
[69:52.76]Both of us, they say both pause on the title.
[69:54.68]Alright, pausing.
[69:59.70]I'm on the title.
[70:01.79]I'm so far ahead of you.
[70:03.23]I'm paused on the title.
[70:06.75]Go.
[70:07.33]I don't think pausing will fix it for me.
[70:09.20]Wait, wait, no, no, no.
[70:10.20]Just refresh it.
[70:10.98]I've refreshed.
[70:11.38]I'm good.
[70:11.64]I can't wait to show you what we've been working on.
[70:14.94]I'm like live now, I think.
[70:16.18]Oh, your stream's live?
[70:18.96]No, I think I'm getting the live feed.
[70:20.12]Whatever, I'll just delay my reactions.
[70:21.16]What's your opinion on cars?
[70:22.24]I think they look nice.
[70:23.34]That's a pretty humble opinion for someone who drives a Ferrari.
[70:25.22]Oh, dude.
[70:48.85]I've invited along some of the team to help give you a taste of some of the amazing content that's waiting for you in Forza Horizon 5.
[70:55.39]Like, seriously, that's fucking so annoying.
[70:56.92]Please welcome Bill, Maddy, Sierra, and Bill from the Forza team.
[71:01.48]Hey, Mike.
[71:02.14]Hey, guys, what's up?
[71:03.34]Hey, everyone.
[71:04.30]Hey, what's up, Mike?
[71:05.64]And we also have Abraham with us as well.
[71:07.93]He's one of the talented actors who will be appearing in the game.
[71:12.69]When you were riding around in it, you fucking sort of should have had a lot to say about how cool it was and...
[71:18.25]Now you want to, like, talk shit.
[71:21.27]That's fine.
[71:22.37]Well... Did you see the sunroof?
[71:23.87]You made a bunch of comments about the sunroof and how fucking cool that was.
[71:29.69]I mean, it was cool.
[71:31.34]I'm just saying that your opinion on cars is like... You're really not that into them to be a guy in a Ferrari.
[71:37.78]You know, I don't think you appreciate it.
[71:43.74]Hold on.
[71:48.39]That's important.
[71:55.14]That's a peek at our adventurous campaign.
[71:57.84]But Forza Horizon has always been a game that's best enjoyed with others.
[72:02.52]Let's go and see what some of our other players are up to.
[72:05.96]The Xbox Series consoles allow us to capture every last detail.
[72:10.35]What are they up to?
[72:14.87]You told me to wait a second.
[72:16.05]I'm like waiting for you.
[72:17.75]This is one of my favorite things about E3 is when you have the fake gamer moments and especially when you have people communicating over voice and they say all the things that no one would ever say.
[72:28.32]Let's watch.
[72:45.54]Let's leave Maddy for a moment and head out to the coast and meet Don.
[72:50.12]Don is already on the move, exploring this idyllic Seaside town.
[72:54.75]This is a recreation of Mexico that is honest, authentic, and filled with love.
[72:59.97]Speaking of, hold up Don.
[73:02.69]Oh hey, what's up?
[73:04.45]This is a mural by Mexican artist Farid Rueda.
[73:08.43]Just one of the many beautiful, faithful pieces of Mexico you'll find all over Forza Horizon 5.
[73:21.89]Like, oh, let's check out and see what's Dawn up to.
[73:24.03]This guy's just trying to play the game.
[73:27.21]It's like, what the fuck are you doing?
[73:29.49]Who are you?
[73:29.95]Why are you in my game?
[73:31.75]Using photogrammetry data captured on location atop an active Mexican volcano.
[73:37.20]The entire world has been recreated at this level of detail.
[73:40.82]I'm not really feeling this one.
[73:42.50]In her favorite off-road boogie.
[73:44.84]It's just another Earth game.
[73:46.14]Exploring is the highest point ever in a Horizon game.
[73:50.00]This actually looks good.
[73:52.76]And I mean the actual graphics.
[73:55.41]I'm really, yeah, I'm very happy that consoles have caught up to what PCs could do like six years ago.
[74:03.11]because games have been looking good lately.
[74:04.36]Yeah.
[74:04.56]But it's a box that you buy once every eight years.
[74:06.02]That is usually under four or five hundred dollars.
[74:27.27]Yeah, but you have to pay for your internet on it separately.
[74:31.65]What do you mean?
[74:34.69]Well, if you want to play online games, don't you need, like, a PlayStation Plus subscription?
[74:40.70]Yeah.
[74:41.04]So every four years, if you're paying $15 a month, how much was it?
[74:44.46]I mean, you have to pay for internet no matter what.
[74:55.00]Why is the internet?
[74:55.78]I'm talking about like a beast computer that can run insane ultra settings.
[74:59.95]It's usually more than a thousand, fifteen hundred bucks, isn't it?
[75:04.07]To run like a game on like ultra?
[75:06.26]And have it look good?
[75:08.10]You need like a pretty beefy computer.
[75:09.58]Not really anymore, actually.
[75:15.32]Well, okay.
[75:16.28]You know what?
[75:16.60]I mean, I'm not gonna argue that they aren't more expensive than consoles, but... It's actually gotten a lot cheaper.
[75:24.33]...filling the scene with god rays as the sunlight dapples through the dense rainforest.
[75:29.09]A Horizon Arcade minigame is about to start.
[75:32.07]Sportsalink knows that Bill loves minigames, so it intelligently prompts Sierra to invite Bill.
[75:37.29]1080.
[75:37.41]I don't have 1080 anymore.
[75:38.61]They're seamlessly linked together with their GPS route set.
[75:42.11]With that Horizon Arcade minigame starting soon, all of our players are coming together.
[75:47.39]For a second, I thought these were people.
[75:49.14]I was like, wait, what the fuck?
[75:51.56]Dropping a payload of pinatas.
[75:53.28]Oh, gamer chat.
[75:54.34]Over this way.
[75:55.24]Gotta catch up to you guys.
[75:57.14]Our players now have to work together to find and pop as many as they can.
[76:01.67]You know what I figured out about this?
[76:12.59]These people are all streaming the game.
[76:15.75]That's what I figured out.
[76:17.23]Because when you stream a video game, this is some inside information for you guys.
[76:20.62]You have to say everything you're fucking doing because you're terrified of dead silence.
[76:24.04]Going through the balls.
[76:26.10]Whoa, big turn.
[76:28.32]Watch out.
[76:28.74]You don't have to, though.
[76:30.40]You do, though.
[76:30.96]You do.
[76:32.00]You can be comfortable with silence.
[76:34.75]They're all streaming the game.
[76:37.21]They're all making videos.
[76:38.33]Streaming.
[76:40.32]I think they'd be louder if they were making videos.
[76:47.67]Would they?
[76:49.37]Yeah.
[76:49.99]I was going to make a really specific example reference.
[76:54.13]But it's been like seven years.
[76:56.04]I'm just going to let them go.
[76:59.78]When is it going to end?
[77:01.18]I mean, Forza's a big deal for a lot of people.
[77:10.88]Team Xbox is on a mission to bring the joy and community of gaming to everyone on the planet.
[77:17.33]That's why you, the gamer, are at the center of everything we do.
[77:21.91]Today, we showed you 30 games.
[77:25.55]27 of them will be available on Xbox Game Pass.
[77:28.89]Now, through the end of the year, you can look forward to back-to-back monthly releases landing day one on Game Pass, led by five new titles from Xbox Game Studios, as well as highly anticipated games like Back 4 Blood, 12 Minutes, and The Ascent.
[77:48.36]And as we look ahead to next year, I'm inspired by the creativity of Bethesda and Xbox Game Studios.
[77:56.58]We showed you the highly anticipated RPG Starfield coming exclusively to Xbox.
[78:03.64]But we also have some of the industry's best RPG storytellers working on Avowed, Fable, The Elder Scrolls Online, Fallout 76, The Outer Worlds 2, and Elder Scrolls 6.
[78:18.37]we unveiled the stunning multiplayer mode for the world's most beloved shooter in Halo Infinite, adding to the roster of iconic Xbox shooters alongside Wolfenstein, Gears of War, Perfect Dark, and Doom.
[78:34.84]Somebody said, why is he nodding and listening so intently?
[78:39.34]He doesn't even have an Xbox.
[78:40.56]I don't.
[78:40.78]Or because Xbox games come to PC.
[78:48.00]While the team in turn 10 is hard at work on the next Forza Motorsport.
[78:52.59]Also, apparently you just love Phil.
[78:54.32]Our growing family of 23 studios is devoted to advancing the medium we all love.
[79:02.23]Oh, that camera change was perfect.
[79:03.55]Coming up.
[79:03.77]There's one more thing.
[79:28.29]take a look at this brand new original game from the Arkane team at Bethesda, the studio that created Prey and Dishonored.
[79:39.28]Arkane created something new for them, an open world immersive shooter that you can play alone or with your friends.
[79:48.37]And like Starfield, this game will be an Xbox exclusive.
[80:10.83]probably 25 centimeters dramatically elongated come on make yourself useful
[80:40.11]I'm sorry, I've seen five distinct four distinct characters, but it's a battle royale.
[80:47.76]As the rocket launcher.
[80:52.19]Sleep tight.
[80:54.01]Hyper with the sands.
[80:54.73]I I'm I'm interested.
[80:57.91]You think they can't kill you anytime they want?
[81:15.66]Wait, is it a four-player shoot-the-people-running-at-you game?
[81:52.14]Is that somebody vlogging?
[81:55.36]I was just here to record a vlog and I accidentally ended up shooting them all.
[81:59.96]America.
[82:12.09]It is.
[82:12.39]It's a four player shoot the people running at you game.
[82:50.02]Nazgoth 2.
[82:51.06]I gotta say this.
[82:54.08]Somebody said, can we mute the Diablo II nerd that hates everything?
[82:59.68]Are you talking about me or are you talking about him?
[83:01.62]I don't know.
[83:07.34]People don't like me.
[83:08.06]You should mute me.
[83:12.36]Both of you?
[83:12.94]Yeah.
[83:16.45]I don't hate everything.
[83:17.41]Did you see my pog face during Slime Rancher 2?
[83:22.09]I'm willing to give Arkane Studios the benefit of doubt on anything, but these types of characters... I don't know.
[83:32.52]They set a certain tone for a game that I don't expect to like.
[83:35.82]And also, by the way, no gameplay, no buy.
[83:38.82]Oh, it's not gameplay.
[83:46.66]I don't know why I thought this was gameplay.
[83:48.94]I was like, oh, game.
[83:50.50]It's worked.
[83:50.92]Oh, dude, yeah, this is gameplay?
[83:54.35]I'm actually really impressed now.
[83:56.71]All in-engine footage.
[83:57.77]This is great.
[84:04.21]Every game has to have a sniper.
[84:05.75]I get it.
[84:06.75]Every game has the rocket launcher, and every Bethesda game has to have a little robot.
[84:11.33]Yeah, and it takes place on Earth again.
[84:13.48]No, no, no.
[84:13.80]That's not Bethesda.
[84:14.50]That's Gearbox.
[84:15.64]What am I talking about?
[84:22.82]Wait, is there a little robot in every Bethesda game too?
[84:28.51]No, I'm thinking of... What's the game with Peter Dinklage?
[84:32.73]The game with Peter Dinklage?
[84:34.29]Yeah.
[84:36.94]It's in a game?
[84:38.20]Yeah, when they replaced him because his voice lines were so bad.
[84:42.53]destiny yeah yeah yeah that that's what will remind me is that just every time I see like a little robot dude the one the first vampire guy looked like the outsider from dishonored I was confused I thought they were doing like like a PlayStation all-stars mashup and that robot was from like some game I don't know
[85:11.48]Destiny's fun, though, isn't it?
[85:14.86]Oh, Destiny's fun, though, isn't it?
[85:16.42]It is.
[85:16.68]No, I'm serious.
[85:17.36]Like, isn't it?
[85:20.22]I played the first one for a little bit.
[85:21.76]It was fun to shoot stuff.
[85:27.01]You know, for all the people that are like, you know, sir, you're annoying.
[85:30.77]Yeah, Destiny 2 is a great game.
[85:36.85]He is annoying, isn't he?
[85:39.57]It was even more annoying that he didn't complain about it.
[85:43.28]Honestly.
[85:44.32]I picked the wrong person to stream this conference with.
[85:47.90]I want someone that's like, oh, sick.
[85:50.50]Actually, I mean, I asked you if you wanted to, so it's my fault.
[85:53.88]It's my bad.
[85:54.36]He just hates everything.
[85:58.78]He bashes everything.
[85:59.68]He's one of those, he bashes, he's angry.
[86:10.08]Some of this stuff does look pretty good.
[86:11.06]I mean, Age of... Is that a remake?
[86:16.23]It is, right?
[86:17.93]Age of Empires?
[86:19.65]Actually, I think it is.
[86:23.57]The thing that most interested me this entire conference was them saying we're still working on a Fable.
[86:30.63]And they didn't even show it.
[86:33.15]Since when are they working on Fable?
[86:36.15]I think he was just saying that they're currently working on it.
[86:39.57]yeah but it was like the briefest of name drops of like oh yeah we're working on like we what yeah but how long has it been holy we've been here for an hour and a half yeah wait what how did that go by that my brain that did not process that an hour and a half has gone by time goes by fast when you're just having lots of fun
[87:02.56]I've been having no fun with you.
[87:03.82]That's the thing.
[87:04.64]I've actually hated every second of being in this call with you.
[87:07.32]I think that you're playing coy and you've had so much fun.
[87:15.00]So what's the big one?
[87:16.28]I feel like I missed everything.
[87:18.44]What do you mean you... I missed everything.
[87:22.74]The big one, they started with Starfield.
[87:25.78]Yeah.
[87:27.88]But that was an hour and a half ago, so you forgot.
[87:32.35]You missed Elden Ring.
[87:33.91]No, I'm just kidding.
[87:34.97]I saw the trailer.
[87:36.59]That looks fucking awesome.
[87:38.07]Alright, wait.
[87:39.19]We gotta talk about Elden Ring for a second.
[87:41.75]Am I to be... Am I wrong here?
[87:44.01]It's an open world FromSoftware like Dark Souls game.
[87:47.71]Like open... Or is it... Because Dark Souls is open world technically, right?
[87:52.13]But like a big open world.
[87:55.79]Supposedly.
[87:56.45]And you get a horse.
[87:58.09]Why would they give you a horse if you didn't have somewhere to go?
[88:00.35]Why are they making that such a point?
[88:01.69]Because all the other Dark Souls games were kind of open world, weren't they?
[88:05.20]Not really.
[88:06.14]They were open in that different paths connected to each other, but they weren't actually open.
[88:11.20]I can't imagine how crazy that would be.
[88:12.88]An open world Dark Souls kind of game.
[88:19.11]It has open fields, but it still has the same dungeons like Dark Souls.
[88:25.41]I don't know.
[88:25.81]Well, but here's something really important about the guy in the call right now.
[88:28.93]The last FromSoftware game that came out, he didn't finish, but I did.
[88:35.06]Which one was the last one?
[88:36.34]Sekiro.
[88:38.32]Remember, you did not beat the last boss in Sekiro.
[88:40.96]You were like, this game's dumb.
[88:42.10]I don't want to even complete it.
[88:44.09]I beat it.
[88:45.09]You're bringing up games that are the most likely to make people not like me.
[88:51.77]Hold on, I gotta turn this ad off.
[88:54.90]I'm getting flashbang by the screen being open.
[88:57.66]Well, hold on.
[88:59.02]The next one is Square Enix at 12.15.
[89:02.42]What time is that?
[89:03.14]That's in like 45 minutes from now.
[89:06.15]Yeah.
[89:06.63]Okay, so we've got a lot to talk about for 45 minutes.
[89:09.29]A huge recap.
[89:10.45]I actually, I don't know if you wanted to keep talking about that.
[89:13.13]I don't know if I'm interrupting, but I know that, like I was saying earlier, this is my...
[89:16.83]This is my big break.
[89:18.37]I don't normally have such high caliber celebrities on my stream.
[89:23.49]And I'm kind of trying to make it as a journalist.
[89:25.71]So I actually wrote up a bunch of interview questions for you.
[89:28.11]And it would be an honor if you would allow me to interview you.
[89:31.97]No.
[89:33.43]No.
[89:34.63]So what did you think about?
[89:36.37]What do you think about me beating Sekiro before you?
[89:42.00]I didn't beat it at all.
[89:43.20]So
[89:44.72]I don't really, I don't think anything.
[89:47.28]Congratulations?
[89:48.10]Somebody said, getting the sus guy is pretty big.
[89:57.31]So what was in that conference that you thought was, that you were interested in?
[90:02.49]Fable?
[90:04.95]Um... you- you wrote down replaced, I wrote it down. Snowboard cameraman I wrote that down- I wrote- I don't know why I wrote that down.
[90:12.00]Why did you write among us?
[90:14.00]I- I just uh... sweeping the nation.
[90:19.00]So wait what the among us thing was that they they're adding more lobby slots?
[90:22.00]Wait, so is it okay for you to interview me?
[90:26.15]Yeah but I don't want to interview you. I don't-
[90:27.00]You are! You- you are interviewing me. You're asking a lot of questions.
[90:29.00]I'm not!
[90:30.00]I have- what would I even ask you? Like, I don't-
[90:33.00]You just asked like three in a row yeah.
[90:37.00]Yeah but- uh but this- I- it's- we're talking about the games we just watched, not about like what you had for dinner last night.
[90:44.00]That was not one of the questions, but you know um...
[90:47.95]I like the camera- the cameraman snowboard game could be funny because you know the laugh out loud moments of being able to take the camera and watch like you like snowboard down.
[90:55.00]I don't know why cause it's you it's not gonna be you, it's gonna be somebody else way more interesting than you.
[90:59.00]But like it's gonna be filming somebody like a hilarious other streamer going and like crashing and jumping over somebody and stuff, you know what I mean?
[91:08.44]I need I need the old person recap. I'm like clicking to the stream what did I just see-
[91:12.44]Wait, you didn't hear what I just said?
[91:14.00]No, no I heard what you just said. I'm looking through like what games they showed that I missed, you understand?
[91:18.00]Because like, there was a couple things that seemed interesting but everything that seemed interesting had no gameplay - which is kind of typical E3.
[91:26.00]I'm curious about the Arcane studios, because Arcane studios has never made a bad game.
[91:34.00]But I don't know what they were showing because there was no gameplay.
[91:37.90]It's going to be like shooter, four player.
[91:41.49]That's very presumptuous of you.
[91:43.41]It's a four player shooter.
[91:45.35]You're jumping to conclusions here, Jerma.
[91:48.67]Even if it's okay.
[91:49.37]I feel like you're not being fair to the developers.
[91:52.17]I always try and give a fair take.
[91:53.49]Alright, hold on.
[91:54.09]But what did you say?
[91:55.09]Arcane Studios.
[91:55.71]What was the last thing they made?
[91:58.88]um prey was the last okay so they make good games yeah they make prey they make dishonored oh okay so yeah they probably um they're probably alright and they're they're making death loop but I think this would be actually the first time that they have made two games at once because I I didn't expect a second game also dark messiah very good game that is a very good game I'm just kidding if you want to play the snowboard game I'll film you
[92:29.54]Oh, okay.
[92:30.08]Yeah.
[92:30.44]No, it's fine.
[92:31.42]I'll do the snowboarding.
[92:32.22]You do the camera.
[92:33.12]Yeah.
[92:34.10]I was just kidding around.
[92:36.72]Something for Dark Messiah.
[92:38.26]I would love to see another one of those.
[92:40.02]Wouldn't you?
[92:42.31]Yeah.
[92:42.57]I would like a Heroes of Might and Magic game.
[92:44.99]When was the last one they even made?
[92:50.11]They've made a bunch of them.
[92:52.48]You just haven't heard of them because they were not very good.
[92:56.40]I said, why are you pretending to play games?
[92:58.94]I know that is what I'm doing, because I don't.
[93:00.22]I mean, there's 22,000 people here.
[93:04.78]I have to at least pretend like I fucking know what I'm doing.
[93:07.81]I have to sit with a hand on my chin and be like, let me tell you something.
[93:11.05]That is not why people are here.
[93:12.51]Right?
[93:17.44]You know, if they wanted to go to Applebee's, they'd just switch the channel.
[93:20.74]Oh.
[93:22.92]You have to be comfortable with silence sometimes.
[93:25.24]I am comfortable with silence.
[93:27.26]Did you see that?
[93:28.40]It was like a dust cloud that just went by the camera.
[93:30.64]That was crazy.
[93:33.02]No, I don't have it open.
[93:34.48]We want the dump truck.
[93:40.26]We're here to see you.
[93:41.58]Oh, thanks.
[93:42.60]No, thank you.
[93:43.08]Seriously.
[93:43.72]Thank you.
[93:46.70]Applebee's Andy.
[93:47.58]You're looking cute today.
[93:52.56]you lost weight I've gained a lot of weight actually I'm like 160. I've gained a shitload of weight I've gained too much weight oh yeah I haven't stood up on I haven't stood up on camera for a while actually no that's versions of me have how wait that really like okay jarbo short jokes but to hear that you're you gained a ton of weight you're 160.
[94:16.44]Where are you going with this?
[94:17.56]That math doesn't, that's weird to me that you could be like, oh yeah, I'm a whole bunch.
[94:21.65]I'm a hundred.
[94:22.19]That's like nothing.
[94:24.59]I'm not, I'm.
[94:26.23]How short do you have to be for like, I've gained a bunch of weight and you to be 160 pounds to be like, oh, it's, oh, it's getting bad.
[94:33.61]I'm five, like eight.
[94:35.38]You know how tall I am.
[94:36.34]Why is this such a mystery?
[94:38.28]Well, that's, I'm just saying that's the first time it has actually hit me as like, I'm on board with this joke.
[94:46.69]There is no joke.
[94:48.57]I'm 5'8 and 160 fat guy pounds.
[94:50.71]Like I need to lose like probably 10 pounds.
[94:52.59]160 cannot be fat guy.
[94:55.05]If you're 5'7 to 5'8, and I'm going to say that range because it depends on what kind of shoes you have on.
[94:59.83]If you have dress shoes on, I become 5'8 and a half.
[95:02.24]Without dress shoes.
[95:03.64]You're a dwarf.
[95:04.90]Without dress shoes, I'm like 5'7 and two quarters or something.
[95:09.02]I have to have dress shoes on.
[95:12.30]My chat, which is scientists, very intelligent people, this guy is saying 160 at your height is perfectly healthy.
[95:27.06]Are you always this down on yourself?
[95:30.53]If you have fucking dress shoes on, you get a little taller.
[95:34.03]How tall are you?
[95:35.73]6'2".
[95:37.55]Yeah, right.
[95:40.38]do you mean yeah right you're like again you've seen me oh six one you're like six feet on a good day alright who by the way who gives a about any of this what did you think about the fable conference I think it was really cool that for about one second they showed a sword and apparently that sword is in fable yeah we can we can we move on to something else this is making me a little nervous talking about how tall I am
[96:08.12]But did you see the first conference?
[96:10.06]Did you see yesterday?
[96:11.32]We could watch yesterday's stuff because I haven't seen any of it.
[96:13.88]No, I've seen that shit.
[96:15.68]It was fucking cool.
[96:16.58]Some of the stuff was cool.
[96:17.38]You really should check it out.
[96:19.12]Yeah.
[96:20.22]I was going to wait because you were like, I'm only going to stream on Sunday.
[96:23.77]And I was like, oh, okay.
[96:25.47]I'll just like, I'll queue it all up for him.
[96:29.87]Because I care.
[96:31.03]But this is where like all the big reveals are.
[96:33.95]Like the Xbox conference.
[96:36.75]That's when that typically happens.
[96:39.07]They typically happen on the first day.
[96:40.63]Can we go take a break?
[96:47.09]I have to go to the bathroom.
[96:49.86]Yeah, when's the next one?
[96:51.96]12.15?
[96:51.98]12.15.
[96:53.54]We have to kill a lot of time here.
[96:56.48]What are we going to do?
[97:00.06]I don't know.
[97:01.08]Shit, how do we kill like 30 minutes?
[97:03.81]This is like 45 minutes.
[97:09.44]I don't know, ma'am.
[97:11.42]What can we even play?
[97:14.78]Among Us.
[97:15.76]I'm not playing Among Us.
[97:17.10]Wait, you know what?
[97:24.39]No.
[97:25.07]No.
[97:25.53]It's the only time I'd ever play it.
[97:28.27]Me and you?
[97:29.27]Who was the imposter?
[97:30.89]You.
[97:31.21]You killed me.
[97:34.76]That's how you do it.
[97:35.48]The reason why I don't play Among Us, and the reason why a lot of... I'll give you the reason.
[97:40.42]I don't... I don't know, like, ten streamers to be like, hey, you guys ready to play Among Us?
[97:46.45]No, I don't... I'm not gonna do that.
[97:49.71]Well, then you're gonna get involved in the streamer drama.
[97:51.83]I know, like, four people.
[98:01.15]I mean, I could always just interview you.
[98:07.28]Just ask people on Twitter.
[98:08.89]Okay, here's the thing.
[98:09.75]I don't really want to play, though.
[98:11.27]I don't really care that much about Among Us to hit up a bunch of people and be like, hey, I want to play Among Us today.
[98:18.89]Can I be in?
[98:25.99]Oh, yeah, that's another thing I got to talk about.
[98:28.31]I got something to talk about.
[98:30.51]Tomorrow, I'm going to be on OTK Schooled.
[98:36.91]You're just making up letters?
[98:37.89]What?
[98:39.47]No, I'm going to be unschooled.
[98:41.47]It's like a game show.
[98:43.90]Oh, never heard of it.
[98:44.68]Just check it out.
[98:45.92]It's going to be fun.
[98:47.62]It's a game where you go through 12 grades.
[98:51.88]You start at like kindergarten.
[98:53.32]You go grade one, grade two, grade three.
[98:55.11]And if you get three questions wrong, you're eliminated.
[98:58.31]Hopefully, I make it past the second grade.
[99:00.43]I'm very concerned.
[99:02.23]I've actually been studying, like, the periodic table and, like, math and shit, because I am stud- it's been, like, 20 years since I've been in a fucking classroom.
[99:10.41]Yeah, when you're in school and you're young, they don't teach you that you don't actually need to know any of it.
[99:16.72]I really hope I get this past, like, the fifth grade or something, because that's, like, okay, right?
[99:21.56]Getting to, like, the sixth grade in a game show, at least, it's like, alright, seventh and eighth grade science questions are kind of- they can be really specific.
[99:31.94]Right?
[99:34.52]Yeah, I do.
[99:36.80]Could you beat yourself?
[99:38.12]You know, you used to do the what did they call it in school?
[99:43.18]The the fitness awards and gym every year.
[99:46.59]Yep.
[99:47.45]They're gonna make you beat your like, your times on the how many pull ups you can do.
[99:53.45]Did I ever tell the story about how I tried to run the mile as fast as I could and I ended up like puking and they put me in a wheelchair and when I had to go through like the halls in my school.
[100:00.90]I haven't heard that, no.
[100:03.94]I've told that story, yes.
[100:05.71]Okay, I'm just making sure I've told it.
[100:07.45]Okay.
[100:08.47]I was so desperate to be... I think you just told it again.
[100:10.77]I did, but I just so badly wanted to... I don't know why I just decided I was going to run the mile and try to get it as fast as I could or do it as best as I could.
[100:20.72]And I think, like, six or seven minutes was, oh, wow, you get your name written down in a book if you go, like, six or seven minutes.
[100:28.33]And I was like, I'm going for it.
[100:29.75]It was awful.
[100:30.93]I felt awful.
[100:32.09]I wasn't really prepared for it.
[100:33.21]I ended up, like, puking behind a tree.
[100:35.11]I couldn't really walk.
[100:36.00]I was so fucked up.
[100:37.42]The teacher, like, the phys ed teacher had to put me in a wheelchair.
[100:40.88]And it was just awful.
[100:43.19]But here's one thing I'm really good at in that shit.
[100:45.95]You know the one where you sit down and you put your feet against the box and you have to put your arms out and go and lean forward?
[100:52.55]How far you can push?
[100:54.05]No, no.
[100:54.27]How far on the line you can put when you put your hands on top.
[100:57.36]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[100:58.34]The sit and reach.
[100:58.90]Yep.
[100:59.60]I am freakishly good at the sit and reach because I have really long, long arms and fingers and like a really long body.
[101:08.40]So I'm able to just like go like this and just I beat everybody's record.
[101:14.03]When I was young, I could do that position, the reach.
[101:17.79]I could put my nose on the ground.
[101:20.41]I can barely reach my knees now.
[101:24.19]What happened?
[101:24.63]You put your nose on the ground?
[101:26.04]No, like if you put your feet out in front of you and like lean forward.
[101:29.12]Yeah, like I could stretch enough that I could put my face on the floor.
[101:36.62]What?
[101:37.78]Yeah.
[101:39.27]Yeah.
[101:40.15]Yeah.
[101:51.81]What?
[101:52.13]What's the problem?
[101:54.47]No, I can't.
[102:00.26]I can't.
[102:00.94]Oh, I see where this is going.
[102:06.64]I see.
[102:06.98]I understand where this is going now.
[102:10.23]Are you a sexual comedy streamer now?
[102:11.87]No, I mean, but like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[102:14.58]You could seriously lean down.
[102:16.56]You could put your face on the ground.
[102:19.36]Is that what you're telling me?
[102:20.84]Yes.
[102:21.38]No, you fucking, no way.
[102:23.36]What are you talking about?
[102:27.08]That's what I'm talking about.
[102:28.26]So you're telling me while you're sitting, if you were back, you could lean forward all the way and have your face touch between your legs and hit the ground.
[102:40.98]well I mean like my body would go forward so like not like not like that close is what you're talking about but yes like if I leaned and tried to do the like touch your toes I could get my face to the ground no you can't I lived it okay we gotta move on because I'm gonna get stuck on this
[103:15.70]Okay.
[103:16.95]Everything's fine.
[103:17.89]Everything's fine.
[103:19.05]I'm just, I've lived it.
[103:21.03]Are you jealous?
[103:22.49]No, I just can't understand.
[103:24.73]I can't believe that what you're describing is something that everybody says is impossible.
[103:31.38]But somehow, you put your face on the ground between your legs.
[103:39.46]Do you understand, like, how that's not even, you make, it doesn't make any sense what you're saying.
[103:44.08]It makes tons of sense.
[103:45.40]No, there's no way you were able to do that.
[103:47.47]There's no way you were able to do that.
[103:49.55]I don't believe it.
[103:50.51]I refuse to believe that's possible.
[103:53.63]You could probably look up a Google, like, a video right now and react to it live on stream, like, someone stretching and do it.
[104:00.57]Like, I've seen videos of people doing crazier stuff than that.
[104:03.65]I'm sure you can look a video up.
[104:16.80]Okay.
[104:17.86]Do you not like those kinds of videos?
[104:19.44]Okay.
[104:25.99]I think it's time we take a quick break and get a little bit of water, refill some coffee, and get prepared for the... What's the next... What's the conference that's coming up next?
[104:32.19]Square Enix?
[104:33.24]Square Enix is coming up next.
[104:34.68]Probably anime games.
[104:36.40]And, you know, growing up, I was just always told that people like, you know, flexible boys.
[104:42.92]Oh my god.
[104:45.50]I just muted him.
[104:48.46]I muted him.
[104:49.58]I'm on his stream, but he's not on mine.
[104:53.66]Yes, you're muted on my stream.
[104:59.27]I can respond to you still.
[105:01.15]Okay.
[105:02.17]I've got to start screening your comments.
[105:05.57]Go ahead and tell me.
[105:16.63]Is that not true?
[105:18.03]I thought at some point you were like, you know what, I'm going to put the actual 18 plus on the channel and I'm going to start saying swear words like, damn.
[105:25.48]There is a mature audience warning on this channel.
[105:28.30]Yeah, so why can't I talk about being flexible?
[105:31.65]It's the way you do things.
[105:34.31]You know what I mean?
[105:34.85]It's the way you do things.
[105:39.25]It's the way you do it.
[105:41.09]Okay, so let me ask you this.
[105:43.51]I'm screening it.
[105:43.96]Go ahead.
[105:47.82]Alright, let me know.
[105:48.78]I'm screening it right now.
[105:59.09]Say that again?
[106:01.61]If you had to.
[106:03.45]If you absolutely had to.
[106:05.47]I'm screening the rest of this.
[106:09.69]Say that one more time.
[106:11.05]If you had to bleach one part of your body, what would it be?
[106:14.08]My hair.
[106:14.86]I don't know.
[106:15.52]What are you talking about?
[106:18.01]Like, alright.
[106:19.41]Alright, he's muted.
[106:21.53]He's gone.
[106:22.17]He's muted.
[106:23.81]I'm going to take a break.
[106:24.75]I'm going to go pee.
[106:26.45]I might grab some more coffee.
[106:28.13]This is going to basically be like a five-plus-minute break, okay?
[106:31.21]Like, I'm not going to turn the stream off, but, like, there's nothing going to be here.
[106:34.40]You agree with that?
[106:38.11]What did you just say?
[106:39.23]I just said, like, let's take a five-minute break.
[106:41.57]A five-minute break?
[106:42.65]Or get, like, a coffee.
[106:43.59]Because, I mean, we got, like, another, like, 20, 30 minutes.
[106:46.71]I'm, like, young and spry enough still that I don't need to get coffee.
[106:50.51]So I'm still just going to be here.
[106:52.01]Alright.
[106:53.19]Well, I don't... I just... I'm not going to be here for, like, at least five minutes.
[106:59.39]Okay.
[107:00.29]Well, are you muting me?
[107:01.65]I just want to make sure that I don't, like, say anything while you're gone.
[107:05.79]Okay.
[107:06.35]Oh, he just came out of my nose.
[107:07.15]I got to go.
[107:11.59]Alright, and turn off your stream too, because I don't want you to talk about me.
[107:15.12]Okay.
[107:15.64]I'm just kidding.
[107:18.38]Alright, I'll be right back.
[107:20.68]I'll be back in like five minutes.
[107:24.20]uh we're gonna do Square Enix and hopefully we don't talk about Ster being able to lean forward far enough uh to touch the ground right okay um we'll I'll we'll be right back after these okay I want to say that this was also like second or third grade so you're making it I okay goodbye good bye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye I'm going I'll be right back goodbye oh my god I'll be back
[107:57.01]I thought you were talking about like, like now, like, like recently.
[108:01.71]Oh my God.
[108:02.43]I'm out.
[108:03.09]Get back.
[108:03.77]Stop.
[108:04.27]Stop.
[108:04.59]Stop it.
[108:05.01]Stop.
[108:05.21]I'm out of here.
[108:05.63]I'm out of here.
[108:06.09]I'll be back in five minutes.
[108:31.84]I need to unmute him, because we didn't talk about this.
[108:34.04]I thought you were saying, yes, I was able to do that maneuver, and oh boy, I got that maneuver up there somewhere.
[108:41.49]I thought you meant like you have that maneuver, it's something that you like developed, and were able to do when you were younger, and it's like something you can still do.
[108:49.57]I specifically said, I used to be able to do this, and I can't even reach my own knees now.
[108:54.60]I was, I didn't even hear the second part of that sentence.
[108:59.51]Okay, I think that you just have, like, a prejudice against me where you expect the things that I say to be things you don't want to hear.
[109:06.41]And that you don't actually give me the floor to speak, um, and you don't really consciously accept what I'm talking to you about.
[109:14.80]I don't know, my fucking, like, my brain thought that, like, this is some- Oh, you know.
[109:19.61]Alright, goodbye.
[109:20.33]I'll be back in five minutes.
