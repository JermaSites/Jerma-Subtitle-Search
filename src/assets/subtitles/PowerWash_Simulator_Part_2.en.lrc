[00:03.14]Hello.
[00:04.38]That was... Hold on.
[00:05.26]Sorry.
[00:09.50]Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[00:10.40]How you doing?
[00:11.38]What's going on?
[00:14.72]That was a really unenthusiastic hello.
[00:18.74]Hello.
[00:20.75]Let me just grab my tea.
[00:21.65]I got a green tea.
[00:22.41]Let me get it.
[00:22.81]I'll be right back.
[00:25.37]That EU stream today.
[00:26.77]That's right.
[00:28.51]Be right back.
[01:11.54]Okay.
[01:13.24]So today, as you're probably recognizing, we've got a sponsor segment today.
[01:22.06]It's gonna be a good one.
[01:25.24]This is PowerWash Simulator.
[01:29.07]If you remember, I played this game about a year ago.
[01:35.25]And, what do you know?
[01:37.43]This shit's in 1.0.
[01:43.91]It's out, I think, actually, literally today.
[01:46.15]Like, right now.
[01:49.54]Hold on, I got the wrong straw.
[03:30.67]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[03:32.09]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[03:34.43]Yeah, the stream is sponsored today by, of course, PowerWash Sim.
[03:43.95]It's out on everything.
[03:45.89]Xbox, Xbox One, PC, Steam, everything.
[03:50.47]Go take a look.
[03:53.13]And so since a year ago, I think they've added a lot of shit to the game.
[03:58.79]So we'll see what they have.
[04:03.48]Is this on Xbox?
[04:04.92]Dude, I'm so happy you asked.
[04:07.20]It's on Xbox.
[04:08.68]Xbox One.
[04:11.19]PC.
[04:12.69]Steam.
[04:22.13]Xbox Series S. Why did that take me so long to say that?
[04:30.22]No, I actually really like this game.
[04:32.28]This game is really fun.
[04:33.14]Last time I played it.
[04:33.78]So, a year of development.
[04:35.00]By the way... Was this game in early access?
[04:40.25]Because... Was this only... That's a pretty awesome story there.
[04:47.63]The game was in early access.
[04:49.79]For like a year.
[04:51.29]Year and a half, whatever.
[04:52.39]And now it's out.
[04:54.43]That's it.
[04:55.09]Easy.
[04:55.93]Early access.
[04:56.57]For like a year.
[04:57.49]Out.
[04:58.12]Released.
[05:03.46]Alright, let's go.
[05:08.70]This multiplayer?
[05:09.52]What the... What?
[05:11.35]What?!
[05:11.61]Alright, hi.
[05:16.11]Hello.
[05:17.89]Alright, so what was in the game last time?
[05:22.09]Was it just this career mode before?
[05:26.28]You have the same shirt as yesterday.
[05:27.52]The shirt I had on yesterday was black.
[05:30.70]This is a gray shirt.
[05:33.44]How would this... This is not the shirt I had on yesterday.
[05:37.73]This is gray.
[05:40.17]You're unclean.
[05:42.55]Well, yeah, maybe I could use a power washing.
[05:50.64]It's the same background.
[05:53.26]I'm sorry, I don't have a funny Zoom conference call joke where there's a roller coaster behind me.
[06:03.61]Dude, it has cross-play with Xbox players, too?
[06:08.07]Holy shit!
[06:09.85]Can I swear on this?
[06:12.39]I think so.
[06:13.05]Okay.
[06:15.05]I hope so.
[06:16.16]Alright, so what did I do last time?
[06:17.74]Alright, I... Wait, did I not finish this?
[06:25.14]Oh, so it kept the other stuff that I did.
[06:27.54]Alright, cool.
[06:30.39]What specials?
[06:31.85]Clean the Mars rover.
[06:33.96]Gnome fountain.
[06:34.90]Steam locomotive.
[06:36.22]Golf course.
[06:40.32]Should I do the golf course?
[06:46.32]Free play?
[06:49.48]Alright, so should I finish what I started here?
[06:54.31]I took a power washing job a year ago.
[06:57.31]And I did half the house.
[06:59.87]I just left.
[07:01.99]And then, I called the same, uh, the same family a year later.
[07:06.21]And I go, hey, uh, you think I could come back and finish that job that I did halfway?
[07:13.42]The same price, of course.
[07:15.88]Alright, let's go.
[07:21.40]Yeah, this is... Oh, I gotta turn the volume up.
[07:27.06]It's a little low.
[07:30.65]Tell me if it's too loud.
[07:38.25]Did I turn it way down?
[07:42.12]Why did I turn the volume so low?
[07:50.06]Why is everything so low?
[07:52.62]There we go.
[07:53.46]Okay, well that's why I did that.
[08:01.21]That was a little too loud.
[08:02.91]That was a little too loud for my liking.
[08:10.54]Okay.
[08:12.40]There we go.
[08:13.94]Alright, so what's wrong with this?
[08:17.76]You were doing a bit the last time you played.
[08:21.72]What was the bit I was doing?
[08:24.95]Oh my God, I hope nobody was at the front door.
[08:29.29]This is like a laser.
[08:33.69]Okay.
[08:35.71]I didn't do anything.
[08:38.27]What was the routine I was doing last time?
[08:41.79]It was, oh yeah, it was all dogs talk like Scooby-Doo.
[08:47.00]That was a fucking year ago?
[08:48.56]I felt like that was last weekend.
[08:53.80]That was that long ago?
[09:03.50]Oh, I love it.
[09:08.13]Ooh, alright.
[09:09.21]So I missed this whole side of the hose.
[09:24.46]Taking care of your gutters for free.
[09:26.54]And that's when I leave a card.
[09:27.88]I leave a card on the fucking front step.
[09:45.06]Oh, isn't there a button you can do to see how much is left?
[09:47.56]How much cleaning you have to do left?
[09:53.87]Tab.
[09:54.35]Yeah, there's like a Hitman see-through walls thing, right?
[10:00.89]How do I get on the roof?
[10:05.34]They're looking out the window right now.
[10:07.40]Honey, I don't know where you found this guy, but he keeps spraying the same two sections of the house.
[10:13.90]And he charges a thousand dollars an hour.
[10:31.39]Oh, you can rotate the nozzle too.
[10:32.45]Oh yeah, you can.
[10:33.31]I remember.
[10:39.28]Is this the new Phasmophobia update?
[10:42.37]No.
[10:42.81]This is PowerWash Simulator.
[10:44.45]It's available right now.
[10:45.61]It just came into 1.0.
[10:46.87]Game's great.
[10:47.53]Game's fun.
[10:48.09]We've played it.
[10:48.61]It's been a while.
[10:50.71]You can get it right now.
[10:52.85]I highly suggest you do.
[10:53.77]The game is fucking phenomenal.
[10:56.61]No music?
[11:02.51]What the hell is this?
[11:06.09]Why did they edit a VR mode?
[11:19.43]Alright, what?
[11:19.87]There's no music?
[11:21.93]How?
[11:26.63]Did I turn it off?
[11:35.26]Did I remove it from the INI files?
[11:45.60]I don't think so.
[11:47.95]Somebody asked, but hey, is it out for Xbox?
[11:50.19]I'm really glad you asked that question.
[11:51.57]Of course it is.
[11:53.17]Xbox Series S. Actually, is it on?
[11:55.63]I don't want to say something that's not true.
[12:00.33]It's on... Alright.
[12:04.10]Xbox has that service.
[12:06.60]Right?
[12:08.22]It's a service that you can pay for and something could be on that service.
[12:11.42]Is it on that service?
[12:16.08]Is it in there?
[12:20.03]It's on that surface.
[12:20.98]Alright, alright.
[12:26.24]Somebody said, what did I do?
[12:32.23]I mean, honest to God, I gotta tell you, it's just good, clean fun.
[12:39.15]It really is, though.
[12:40.11]I'm serious.
[12:56.23]What if I just don't do the roof?
[12:58.05]How the fuck are they gonna know?
[12:59.07]You know what I mean?
[13:01.99]They're gonna come out here and they're gonna go, oh, wow!
[13:05.53]Oh, you did such a good job!
[13:06.73]Look at that garage door!
[13:07.96]Look at that window that hasn't been cleaned like that in 20 years!
[13:12.22]They're not gonna go on the roof and look at their ceiling?
[13:14.90]Why would they do that?
[13:19.22]And if, you know, if Dad wants to be like, oh, let me, can I check the roof?
[13:22.30]I'd be like, that's done, that's unsafe.
[13:23.86]Let a professional go up there.
[13:25.74]And then I'll go up there.
[13:27.95]And I'll look around and be like, this is clean as hell.
[13:31.13]Holy shit, this is clean.
[13:33.23]And then that dad's going to be in slippers and he's going to have a newspaper in his hand.
[13:35.98]He's going to go, oh yeah?
[13:36.52]I want you to lick the top of the roof.
[13:41.52]And I'm going to be like, of course I will.
[13:55.75]Hurry up?
[13:56.87]You don't hurry up a job like this.
[14:02.21]This is... I'm power washing.
[14:03.85]You don't hurry up.
[14:09.84]By the way, how did I go from 50% to 40%?
[14:11.26]I don't get it.
[14:27.39]You're making it worse?
[14:30.57]There's not dirty water in here.
[14:31.83]It's clean water.
[14:32.77]You're going to spend an hour washing the front steps.
[14:38.77]No, I'm not going to do that.
[14:41.50]Do I have a streamer mode on because of the music?
[14:46.60]I don't think I do.
[14:49.94]Streamer mode.
[14:57.62]Auto save, aim mode, stance, dirt details, FOV, obviously, right?
[15:05.50]I don't think so.
[15:06.56]I think it's my game.
[15:07.52]I think I just, I don't know.
[15:09.84]Try the YouTuber mode?
[15:10.90]I don't, no, no, no.
[15:11.48]I don't, I don't know.
[15:12.64]Maybe I like, maybe I think I screwed something up.
[15:16.70]Wait, how about reset audio defaults?
[15:23.94]Should I try that?
[15:27.44]Is there even music in the game here?
[15:35.23]Okay, I need the bigger nozzle.
[15:38.05]Give me the wide one.
[15:39.31]No, where's the wide one?
[15:40.19]There it is.
[15:40.65]Alright.
[15:48.87]Every time I ever see anybody power wash, they always do it so wrong.
[15:52.91]They always do this thing where they're like, oh, did I do it?
[15:55.49]No, what you have to do is you have to act like a copy machine.
[15:58.78]It's kind of like robotic movements.
[16:07.72]I need to touch up.
[16:15.62]I love that sound.
[16:16.24]The sound effect is actually really good.
[16:23.99]Alright, I'll back it up.
[16:27.09]Dermot thinks he knows everything?
[16:32.48]No, but I've power washed before.
[16:37.30]I've done it before.
[16:39.08]Not professionally, but I've done it before.
[16:41.06]Alright, no one messing around.
[16:46.34]Let's actually get this done.
[16:50.36]Okay, sure.
[16:53.85]I've power washed before.
[16:54.99]Yeah, and some of you clowns that power wash, you do this.
[17:07.75]Trust me, I know the technique.
[17:10.25]The look, it's clean.
[17:13.84]And then, you know, dad comes out and goes, no it isn't.
[17:19.80]And you're like, fuck!
[17:31.20]And then Dad's gonna take it anyways.
[17:34.24]At the end.
[17:34.74]And just do it all again.
[17:38.24]No, no, no.
[17:41.00]Stop, stop.
[17:41.44]Let me see that for a second.
[17:42.40]Let me see that.
[17:53.00]Alright, that's good.
[17:54.72]It's like, Dad, you just... You just did the whole thing again.
[17:59.81]And then you go, no, no, no, dad, give me that thing.
[18:03.05]Because it's fun to do.
[18:08.32]And you end up power washing the same thing like four times.
[18:10.78]Alright, I think the front steps are fine.
[18:21.85]Did I miss anything?
[18:22.63]Oh, hold on.
[18:24.05]I did.
[18:35.10]Watching your stream makes me sneeze.
[18:38.84]I think I would calculate the dust in your room.
[18:44.94]Are you sure it's not when you're sitting at your computer?
[18:51.27]There's no time limit on this.
[18:52.31]It's fine.
[19:03.53]Is this pre-recorded?
[19:04.59]Why, why, why would this be, no, what are you talking about?
[19:08.13]Pre-recorded.
[19:14.60]Ooh, that, it's done.
[19:15.54]That's the only thing I've done though.
[19:17.32]How long have I been playing?
[19:18.24]I've been playing for 20 minutes and I finally got my first ding?
[19:24.91]What?
[19:26.65]How long have I been sitting here for?
[19:28.87]I just got my first ding in 20 minutes.
[19:36.52]That's impossible.
[19:54.11]This is... Oh.
[19:57.79]What?
[19:58.03]Where's my ladder?
[20:03.43]That's the best part, by the way.
[20:04.55]That's the best part.
[20:05.57]Right here.
[20:09.05]And then.
[20:13.45]And then.
[20:16.68]When you see all the dirt just fly everywhere and it turns into this like brown sewer water looking stuff.
[20:21.62]Oh my god, I love it.
[20:30.72]Okay.
[20:30.94]So.
[20:31.16]43.
[20:31.30]Recycled joke?
[20:33.34]How's that?
[20:33.58]That's not a recycled joke.
[20:34.53]What are you talking about?
[20:39.66]Recycled joke.
[20:40.34]You don't remember what I said a year ago, okay?
[20:45.87]You don't remember what I said a year ago?
[20:51.29]And by the way, how is that a joke?
[20:52.73]That's me saying I like something.
[21:03.30]You know, like, I'm not ordering food at a restaurant with you, and it's just like, oh, what do you want, man?
[21:06.70]What do you want to eat?
[21:07.32]Uh, dude, I think I'm doing the, uh, like, I don't think, I'm just gonna go with, like, the turkey club.
[21:11.49]Okay.
[21:14.17]What are you really gonna order, though?
[21:16.11]I'm ordering a turkey, I like turkey sandwiches, it's cool.
[21:19.27]Dude, stop, stop this fucking bit, and order a tuna sandwich.
[21:21.97]What are you, what are you talking about?
[21:41.25]Second ding in the night.
[21:42.17]There it is.
[21:47.28]There we go.
[21:47.52]Alright.
[21:57.18]Is that, is that, it's kind of loud.
[21:58.24]Let me turn that down.
[21:59.00]Just a, just a tiny bit.
[22:00.98]Just a little.
[22:01.46]Let me turn this up.
[22:07.14]Turn this down just a little.
[22:12.77]That sounds nice.
[22:19.93]Is that better?
[22:20.37]A little more.
[22:24.54]Now we can hear the birds and shit.
[22:25.54]That's better.
[22:28.34]That's better.
[22:34.44]That's better.
[22:35.12]Okay.
[22:36.24]That's good.
[22:40.80]There's up to six people in co-op, by the way.
[22:49.02]That seems kind of chaotic.
[22:53.98]I need the ladder now, because there's no way I'm going to do that.
[22:55.86]I'm not going to be able to get up there.
[23:01.54]Should I change this?
[23:05.08]Oh, no.
[23:05.72]Okay, I had this upgraded once already.
[23:07.72]Alright.
[23:11.04]So, where's this still dirt?
[23:12.76]Oh, this is the best part.
[23:13.46]Here we go.
[23:13.84]Check this out.
[23:14.76]In one sweep.
[23:38.85]Feels good.
[23:54.29]I was holding my breath for that one.
[24:04.98]Oh my god, what the... The whole top of the house needs to be done.
[24:13.24]There we go.
[24:13.66]You're gonna start seeing dings every five seconds now.
[24:22.13]Steps?
[24:22.67]Where?
[24:24.59]Concentrating blast.
[24:31.68]I am pissing somebody off so bad right now.
[24:33.30]You know what I mean?
[24:37.04]There's at least a few of you in the chat right now that have had a clenched fist since I turned it on the stream.
[24:59.55]Doesn't it feel like something is adding more dirt to it?
[25:02.38]Every time you power wash, this happens.
[25:04.58]I feel like I did this five times already.
[25:09.06]But I didn't.
[25:13.24]There we go.
[25:17.11]Where's my ding?
[25:24.01]Where's my ding?
[25:24.79]Oh my god, it's underneath.
[25:31.51]The splash was reflecting off of this guy's car, and I thought the police were here.
[25:38.65]I was like, wait, what?
[25:49.29]I can't get underneath.
[25:54.90]How am I supposed to get underneath here?
[26:05.75]I need this one.
[26:06.37]Yeah, the one that spins.
[26:21.34]There we go.
[26:21.68]Let's see you ding.
[26:27.85]You're going like this.
[26:29.01]I'm doing this so wrong.
[26:32.21]Stand up.
[26:32.85]Just get up.
[26:51.06]What?
[27:00.41]Alright, that's good enough.
[27:03.16]That's actually good enough.
[27:06.26]It is!
[27:08.32]No human can come out here and tell- You're gonna come out here and- and- and what, swab it?
[27:12.12]And send it to a lab and test it for dirt?
[27:14.82]There's nothing else here.
[27:15.60]I'm sorry, if I see out the window this guy lying on his back, aiming up at the same place, I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna open the door and be like, That's good!
[27:30.31]That's good!
[27:30.87]You don't have to do- That's alright, man, don't worry.
[27:40.96]Stop peeling the paint.
[27:52.56]It's the whole railing.
[28:00.31]Oh my goodness, look at all this.
[28:22.88]Got it.
[28:24.29]What?
[28:24.75]No way.
[28:28.23]That shit was here.
[28:28.91]That's part of the foundation of the house at this point.
[28:30.93]Alright.
[28:31.31]It's not.
[28:32.19]I can't clean it.
[28:32.83]Alright.
[28:42.08]You look like Emperor Palpatine.
[28:44.86]I was going to give you a no.
[28:46.46]I was going to just do the laser hands into the screen.
[28:48.36]I was like, nah.
[28:54.34]I was gonna laser hands you.
[29:14.08]Oh my god.
[29:18.65]What's this thing?
[29:20.07]Change stance?
[29:21.93]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[29:23.11]Change stance.
[29:24.73]What does that mean?
[29:27.37]Oh, wait.
[29:28.09]There are three stances.
[29:30.09]Okay.
[29:30.88]One of them is crouch.
[29:31.66]The other one is lie down.
[29:35.40]I am proning crawling right now.
[29:38.54]Crawling around.
[29:39.74]Imagine looking out the window.
[29:41.42]You see like a guy like, let's go!
[29:44.84]Just proning and like...
[29:48.91]Got him!
[29:52.39]What the fuck?
[29:55.35]A guy proning in your front lawn.
[29:58.37]Just like, aiming up with the power washer.
[30:08.52]Alright, stop coming over here.
[30:10.40]I keep doing the front door.
[30:18.26]house I'm sorry if you have this meticulous about this this water going into the house nobody has weather stripping that's that good this is going like this is going in the house in their living room
[30:43.99]The guy's going to open the front door and he's going to have water all over him.
[30:47.61]Like he took a shower.
[30:49.94]He's going to be like... Is that supposed to happen?
[31:01.89]Standing there for 20 minutes blasting the door.
[31:07.51]I feel like this would break a window, right?
[31:10.35]I wouldn't want to do that.
[31:22.96]I can't still be here.
[31:38.77]You physically can't get up there.
[31:41.41]Nobody can.
[31:41.79]I have to ricochet it.
[31:47.64]I can't do it.
[32:03.02]Got it.
[32:03.56]Alright, that's done.
[32:04.56]Good.
[32:06.74]What the f- What?
[32:08.16]How- I've done- Honest to God.
[32:11.90]I- I've done this ten times.
[32:17.97]How can this still be edges of the fence that I haven't gotten?
[32:37.22]I don't understand.
[32:38.20]I feel like it's respawning.
[32:44.11]This is like Resident Evil mold on this person's house.
[32:47.19]I've done this like five times.
[33:04.09]Well, duh.
[33:04.87]It's your enemy.
[33:05.57]It's an FPS.
[33:14.62]But again, yeah, the stream is sponsored by PowerWash Simulator.
[33:23.89]This game's actually really fucking fun.
[33:27.15]And you can get it on Xbox, Xbox S, Steam, everything.
[33:33.49]All this stuff.
[33:35.97]It's got co-op.
[33:36.85]It's in 1.0.
[33:37.61]This is a different person's house.
[33:45.66]What the hell happened?
[33:47.46]Wait, what?
[33:56.27]Excuse me?
[33:56.93]Okay, well.
[34:10.87]Where do I even start?
[34:11.95]Okay, I gotta... Don't start this yet.
[34:14.25]Yeah, I know it's dirty.
[34:15.35]I know there's dirt on this side.
[34:18.45]This is like a Harvey Dent house.
[34:29.70]No, this is like two roommates.
[34:32.78]Or it's like a duplex.
[34:33.90]There's two tenants here.
[34:34.76]One of them's evil, and the other one's like an angel.
[34:38.38]And they share a flat together.
[34:44.47]Alright, where's the... How do I get to the... I'm going to go up on the roof.
[34:55.04]Oh, it actually is prone.
[34:55.96]It's been blocked by my drink this whole time.
[34:59.66]How do I... Where's the ladder?
[35:01.46]Oh, hi.
[35:08.13]Alright, let's take care of this.
[35:09.93]Because this is ridiculous.
[35:16.18]I feel like I should do this from the ground.
[35:17.50]Alright, here's the one incredibly important factor in this whole thing.
[35:29.63]Don't leave until it's done.
[35:31.73]You know what I mean?
[35:34.53]Don't leave until it's all gone.
[35:37.21]What I keep doing is I keep spraying and talking and spraying and I just walk away.
[35:42.44]Don't leave this spot until this is all gone.
[35:45.96]Because I keep just walking away after spraying it.
[35:52.58]Okay.
[35:54.16]So far, so good.
[35:59.90]Alright, so this is done on this side.
[36:01.80]What about up here?
[36:07.66]Okay, so now I just have to deal with this.
[36:22.29]You're sponsored to power wash and you can't do it.
[36:26.77]I think I'm doing just fine.
[36:28.09]I think I'm doing just fine.
[36:28.91]You're at 6% an hour.
[36:30.29]Do you have any idea how long it would take to power wash this house in real life?
[36:37.48]The condition of the outside of this house?
[36:40.16]It would take two months.
[36:44.85]I would have to come back and do reverse coats of paint.
[36:48.84]You know what I mean?
[36:49.50]I would have to come back on three separate occasions.
[36:52.10]Like four or five separate weeks.
[36:57.33]This would take three months to do.
[37:26.82]Here we go.
[37:30.40]Think someone could speedrun this game?
[37:32.18]That would be awesome.
[37:33.66]I'm sure people have already tried to do it.
[37:42.49]I wonder.
[37:43.09]People already do.
[37:43.77]Yeah, I wonder.
[37:45.43]I wonder just... This house in particular, I wonder how long it took to do a 100%.
[37:54.11]You better believe that's going to be hard to do.
[38:01.91]I think we're almost good.
[38:02.57]I have to have a ding coming soon.
[38:05.39]Has to be, right?
[38:09.92]Really?
[38:17.58]Get out of the... What the hell?
[38:20.14]There it is.
[38:20.62]Alright.
[38:21.12]So there's that ding.
[38:29.34]I like the beard.
[38:29.86]You should grow it out.
[38:30.56]I can't.
[38:31.48]I literally can't.
[38:35.04]This is like one of those ads for mobile games where the person in the ad is like insanely incompetent.
[38:39.46]So you want to download the game just to show that you can actually do it unlike the dumbass in the ad.
[38:50.34]But that's so unfair.
[38:53.01]Well, then go get it.
[38:55.91]It's on Xbox.
[38:57.03]It's on Steam right now.
[38:58.09]It's on fucking Game Pass.
[38:59.39]Go get it.
[39:01.47]Why don't you do it?
[39:04.94]That's so unfair, though.
[39:05.98]You know why that's unfair?
[39:06.98]Because in those mobile game ads, and trust me, I've seen millions of them.
[39:10.16]I've seen millions of those ads.
[39:11.86]All I do is play iPad games.
[39:14.42]You understand that it's usually like, oh, no, there's a fire.
[39:19.38]What do we do to put the fire out?
[39:20.70]And there's two options pop up on screen here and here.
[39:23.88]And one of them is a fire extinguisher.
[39:25.56]And the other one is like a golf club.
[39:28.94]And they try to drag the golf club up on the fire.
[39:32.94]I'm not doing that here.
[39:34.78]I'm not doing that.
[39:37.20]I'm power washing.
[39:38.66]I'm doing it the correct way.
[39:45.67]If I had a golf club in my hands and I was hitting the side of this house, then I would understand your point.
[39:51.41]What?
[39:52.13]Why?
[39:52.61]Come on.
[40:03.06]The golf club is your brain.
[40:19.95]Alright, I didn't finish this part.
[40:29.34]I'm getting tutorials.
[40:31.54]Oh, it's because I never pressed them.
[40:32.81]Okay.
[40:34.89]So this is done, right?
[40:38.10]Alright, this one's done.
[40:39.58]Keep going.
[40:40.88]Now, I'm moving on.
[40:42.92]This whole side of the house has to get done, but I'm not doing that right now.
[40:45.74]Of course it's 47%.
[40:47.52]The Satan, demon person that lives over on this side, I have to do their house.
[41:03.63]Come on.
[41:25.99]I want to try to get it up over the fence.
[41:28.66]I physically don't think you can.
[41:55.41]It legally touched my truck, therefore it's mine.
[41:57.31]It touched my truck, therefore it's legally mine.
[42:01.01]Where'd it go?
[42:03.41]I never put my hands on it.
[42:07.71]What was I doing?
[42:08.15]Oh yeah, I gotta go up here.
[42:22.01]You're doing the mobile ad.
[42:25.84]No, even if I were to sit here and do this.
[42:31.02]Okay.
[42:33.44]Nozzle 4.
[42:39.22]Oh, what?
[42:39.92]It worked!
[42:42.50]I would still be doing more than the mobile ads always do.
[42:45.16]You understand?
[42:45.54]Like, I'm actually still doing it.
[42:47.42]I'm still actually pressing the button and washing the side of the house.
[42:52.58]That, like, even if I was doing it like that.
[42:59.71]You know what's actually really funny about mobile ads now?
[43:03.37]I think we've talked about this a little bit, but there's a game that I see ads for all the time now, and it's like, aren't you getting sick and tired of those ads that show the slide, the puzzle game, and it's never in the game?
[43:16.80]We have that in our fucking game.
[43:18.88]We actually have that.
[43:20.44]All these, like, posers, it's so funny.
[43:24.62]And you know what?
[43:26.46]They must be pissed.
[43:30.19]They must be pissed off because they actually have this slide the puzzle, watch out for the fire and get the gold game, right?
[43:36.87]And everybody else is doing that in their ads.
[43:40.83]And they just have to sit there and go, well, that's our game.
[43:43.86]We actually have that in the video game.
[43:49.20]It's like, do you want to play that game?
[43:50.70]We have it.
[43:51.48]We actually have that in our game.
[43:55.95]They don't, it's been debunked.
[43:57.37]No, I know, but my point is that there are companies right now, I'm getting ads right now of somebody literally saying, Hey, those ads are bullshit, aren't they?
[44:07.56]I know, we have that game, it's not fair.
[44:11.86]I swear, I promise you.
[44:14.10]But they don't have it either.
[44:16.61]What?
[44:19.53]It's not in that game either?
[44:26.75]Hold on a minute.
[44:28.55]But you can't... I don't know about that.
[44:32.03]I feel like that's inaccurate.
[44:33.37]You can't make an ad stating, hey guys, aren't you sick and tired of those ads that show that game and it's not in the game?
[44:41.64]Download ours, ours is in there and it's not in there.
[44:43.92]What?
[44:44.32]No, no way.
[44:48.36]That's impossible.
[44:58.44]It's true.
[44:59.60]What?
[44:59.92]Okay, but hold on.
[45:02.76]It might not be the core of that game.
[45:06.04]Right?
[45:07.02]It might not be the core gameplay of that game, but is it in the game and can you actually do it?
[45:16.85]No.
[45:19.51]What?
[45:20.23]No, it's not.
[45:21.11]It's impossible.
[45:29.19]Hey, fuck all those other games, man.
[45:31.89]We got that in our game.
[45:33.21]And it's not in the game?
[45:34.44]No.
[45:35.20]I cannot speak to that.
[45:37.02]I don't know how true that is.
[45:44.64]Dude, why doesn't somebody just make one of those?
[45:47.90]Just make a slide the puzzle game, and then you can be the savior, the hero of the mobile game ad world.
[45:57.18]You know what I mean?
[45:57.98]Just make one.
[46:07.31]Because I'll tell you, if I downloaded a game, and I saw that it had the sliders in it, and that kind of, and that, it was just a hundred levels, or like five hundred levels of that game.
[46:15.46]I'd be like, you know what?
[46:17.32]Nice job.
[46:18.14]Nice work, actually.
[46:20.58]Actually good work.
[46:30.81]Alright, now somebody has to edit me in to just like interior of just like a living room.
[46:37.67]And, you know, just like a, you know, family just kind of like whatever sitting around like a stock image or something.
[46:42.84]And have muffled audio of what I was just doing.
[46:47.04]And have loud kind of footsteps on the top of the roof.
[46:52.34]I think that would be pretty funny.
[47:04.35]Alright, what is left?
[47:05.25]Alright, we gotta get more concentrated here.
[47:32.63]God, I'm just thinking about this right now.
[47:35.99]There's an engineer move in TF2.
[47:37.91]Okay.
[47:42.71]Hold on, slow me down.
[47:44.13]I need to slow down.
[47:45.90]I have to slow down.
[47:51.72]Okay, let me rephrase that and say what I wanted to say.
[47:55.76]A TF2 weapon as a power washer would actually be pretty fun.
[48:03.84]Like a water jet.
[48:04.32]You know what I mean?
[48:40.01]Come on, give me the ding.
[48:41.57]The ding is so close.
[48:47.70]The ding is so close, dude.
[49:04.04]Come on.
[49:04.74]Where's the ding on the side of the house?
[49:06.72]This one little piece.
[49:07.92]Where is it?
[49:11.62]right here come on ding
[49:47.07]How come I'm not getting a ding?
[49:58.17]Is this why?
[49:58.81]Down here?
[50:08.48]You've got to wash your sin.
[50:09.84]I don't know.
[50:12.94]I think that would take a while.
[50:16.92]Only red is the wall?
[50:17.98]Wait, what do you mean?
[50:18.58]What do you mean?
[50:31.73]What are you talking about?
[50:41.84]Hold on, I'm typing.
[50:42.56]Hold on.
[50:49.07]I'm typing.
[50:49.83]You need to relax.
[50:57.44]Okay, so it's just the entire wall.
[51:02.20]How do I get from here to there?
[51:03.18]Alright.
[51:22.75]God, that was fun.
[51:26.61]There's a much better way I can do that.
[51:30.15]There's a much better way I can do that.
[51:37.43]So should I?
[51:37.97]Okay, for all you power washers out there.
[51:41.29]It's big nozzle, straight down into sections, right?
[51:44.89]So I start here, and walk backwards.
[51:48.90]This is poop from an airplane.
[51:50.40]Oh my god, dude.
[51:56.35]There's so many bird shits on this house.
[52:00.29]Honestly, you know what's crazy though?
[52:05.82]I wonder how much bird shit is on your roof.
[52:09.38]It's probably awful.
[52:11.52]It's probably crazy.
[52:19.29]I can't imagine what everybody's just straight down bird's eye view roof looks like.
[52:26.37]Because unless you do something like this, it's probably covered in bird shit.
[52:46.05]It rains.
[52:47.35]Not everywhere.
[52:50.63]It does not rain a lot in every location.
[52:56.16]Not here.
[52:57.19]Not in Vegas.
[52:58.89]I wonder how many bird shits I have on my roof.
[53:00.63]Are you keeping track?
[53:22.82]How would you keep track of bird shits?
[53:27.86]What, are you gonna go up there every few days?
[53:31.10]Go up there with a clipboard?
[53:32.18]Just to see your neighbor just, like, making marks?
[53:35.76]And you don't clean it?
[53:44.45]Alright, so that top is alright.
[53:45.61]Now, I'm gonna go this way first.
[53:48.71]Don't forget about the chimney.
[53:57.19]You know, I have to give the devs credit because it's not just like, oh yeah, just spray it a little and just go side to side and you did it.
[54:05.91]You actually have to do this.
[54:06.95]You have to actually truly power wash this house.
[54:11.83]I have to actually get in here and do all this.
[54:19.99]It seems like there's a lot more content since when we last played a year ago.
[54:24.89]Does the game look better?
[54:25.77]I feel like the graphics are better.
[54:27.57]Am I out of my mind?
[54:47.92]It's the same house, it's a year later.
[54:56.53]Don't fall.
[54:58.96]I'm just spraying into the chimney.
[55:05.02]Yeah, I gotta clean the chimney too.
[55:15.99]Oh my god, I can jump high.
[55:18.69]I'm looking for the ding.
[55:32.44]I can't get in there.
[55:33.28]I can't get in there.
[55:36.16]It's unsafe for me to get in here.
[55:37.66]I need the wiggle one.
[56:17.01]It's unsafe I can't get it to ding either Maybe I just spray it up there
[56:34.95]It's this tiny little piece on the left.
[56:38.47]Just get it on the other side.
[56:39.53]Can I put the ladder up there?
[56:42.99]You missed the whole right side.
[56:45.80]Oh.
[56:45.90]It's all good.
[56:49.02]We're good.
[56:51.56]This should be a grenade.
[56:57.37]Why are you seriously making me contemplate if that would work?
[57:05.79]If you had a device that was a water grenade, but what would you use it for?
[57:15.57]It was a pressurized water system in the thing and it just like shot out.
[57:19.53]That wouldn't, it would work.
[57:24.35]No, it wouldn't.
[57:26.23]It would clean.
[57:27.00]It would be soap and water in the grenade.
[57:33.53]Well, hire the cleaning service.
[57:35.79]Yeah.
[57:36.35]The guy just shows up.
[57:37.11]He's got like, fucking grenades on him.
[57:40.31]He's just like, yeah, I'm ready.
[57:41.98]Everybody, if we could get up out of the house, that'd be great.
[57:44.96]Everybody leaves.
[57:46.68]Okay.
[57:47.24]So what's the dirtiest room in the house?
[57:48.66]Bedroom.
[57:49.24]Okay.
[57:50.54]It's just soap.
[57:57.16]And just the bedroom's destroyed.
[58:13.05]That's Phil's water grenades.
[58:22.83]That'll be $800.
[58:34.68]you you walk out phil phil's like in his car doing like some paperwork and it's like oh thanks for coming phil and he's like yeah yeah it's all good hold on a second I just gotta clean my car you look and you're like yeah your car's looking a little dirty phil die don't worry about it I got it he just steps out he just throws a grenade in the car and it's just cartoon just the car just goes like
[59:03.19]There's just some papers fucking everywhere.
[59:05.03]There's all kinds of, like, destruction.
[59:12.38]He goes to turn the car on.
[59:17.86]Hey, look, buddy.
[59:19.22]I think I can borrow your car for a few hours.
[59:21.77]I've got a few more.
[59:22.45]I've got a few more of these jobs.
[59:39.19]I've been cleaning the save spot for 15 minutes.
[59:41.91]Yeah, man!
[59:45.31]I know!
[59:55.32]Let us bet on what?
[60:05.91]What do you need to bet on?
[60:10.92]You just set them up around the whole house?
[60:21.25]What are you talking about?
[60:22.15]Alright, slow down, slow down.
[60:33.18]Come on.
[60:40.22]This is not powerful enough, you see.
[60:41.86]I gotta go harder.
[60:50.13]That's Splatoon.
[60:50.99]Yeah, but nobody's going... I can't do this on camera because I look weird.
[61:00.03]You know the exact thing I was gonna do.
[61:03.37]Everybody knows the exact sound effects I was just going to do.
[61:06.89]All of you.
[61:08.43]You saw my neck go like this, tilted.
[61:12.37]You knew exactly what was going to happen.
[61:13.77]I feel like that's too predictable.
[61:29.97]We don't care.
[61:30.77]We want it.
[61:33.49]Alright, mods, run a poll, please.
[61:35.49]If it gets to at least 80% with at least 5,000 votes, I'll do the noise.
[61:39.65]I'll do the thing that everyone wants me to do.
[61:51.54]Remember, everybody, you saw my neck tilt.
[61:54.42]You know what could have happened, so...
[62:00.56]Well, you play Splatoon with... I don't... I couldn't play Splatoon.
[62:04.08]I don't know why.
[62:05.68]Something about it just... I kind of just didn't get it.
[62:09.42]I completely understand.
[62:12.13]But... You know what?
[62:13.81]It kind of just triggered old memories of playing Tony Hawk with friends.
[62:18.21]And it was that mode where if you did a trick on something, it would change to their color.
[62:24.05]I remember just doing really well, and just like, ba-boom, orange, ba-boom, orange, ba-boom, orange, orange, and I had the whole, and then I would turn around for five seconds, and my dickhead friend has got like a two million point combo going, and he runs over every single thing I did, and I just turn around, it's all blue, and it's like, why am I even playing the game?
[62:43.04]So that's why I don't, like, that's just Splatoon for me.
[62:55.66]Alright, let's see, it has to be over 80% and it has to be at least 5,000 votes.
[63:05.73]And I'll do it.
[63:10.35]Somebody just said, dude, it takes two clicks to vote.
[63:12.79]Come on, guys.
[63:13.71]And there's some of you just sitting there, leaning back, just like, nope, I ain't doing that.
[63:19.32]I don't care.
[63:26.82]It's so funny doing votes and polls and just the amount of people that just genuinely just don't care about any of this It's just like I don't care what he does just I just like kind of hanging out Do we like applaud those viewers by the way they just hang out they just watch they just chill They don't have to vote
[63:57.96]It's time to do it.
[64:00.56]What the fuck?
[64:03.56]95%?
[64:03.72]Are you kidding me?
[64:08.93]I thought this was impossible.
[64:10.13]Okay.
[64:10.65]Well... Alright, fine.
[64:19.96]I don't... Somebody had boughted that or faked it or something.
[64:24.38]There you go.
[64:31.64]That's why I don't do that with the camera on.
[64:37.32]I'm available.
[64:38.81]But I probably won't show up.
[65:02.25]95%.
[65:02.41]I don't think we've ever seen that before.
[65:10.42]I've never seen a 95% with that many votes.
[65:18.14]Dude, I love this game.
[65:19.21]You know why I love this game?
[65:21.11]Because I can just power wash and we can talk about Splatoon noises.
[65:25.13]It's perfect.
[65:39.15]Hashtag ad.
[65:39.77]Yeah, hashtag ad.
[65:41.71]That's right.
[66:02.45]Copium?
[66:03.65]What?
[66:23.43]Huh.
[66:25.89]Why do you think... When are you doing iPad stream?
[66:31.97]Um... You know, I set up the iPad stream, but I just... I just didn't... I just didn't do it because... I don't know.
[66:40.74]I downloaded 50 of these wacky, wild iPad games.
[66:46.46]But...
[66:48.19]Some of them just wouldn't open.
[66:49.49]I didn't want to play them off-stream because I didn't want to have genuine, like, what the hell's going on reactions, right?
[66:56.10]But I would open some of them.
[66:58.00]And this became an issue where I was like, you know what?
[67:00.96]Like, let's just see if some of them work, right?
[67:03.62]Some of them just didn't turn on.
[67:05.04]Some of them would crash after 10 seconds.
[67:07.32]And that became not funny.
[67:14.11]So, now there's going to be a new system in place.
[67:16.83]This is the stream that I want to do.
[67:17.87]I want to do a stream where... And years ago, this concept was thought up.
[67:26.36]That you play an iPad game with no premium purchases.
[67:32.44]And every time an ad comes up, you download that game and move on to that game that you see.
[67:40.30]Every time, no matter what.
[67:47.67]That's the game.
[67:52.57]So I think we're going to do that.
[67:59.93]Or you might get an ad immediately after downloading one of these.
[68:07.88]And I guess some of the rules we could make is it has to be a full page ad.
[68:12.00]It can't just be something like a banner that pops up on the bottom or whatever, right?
[68:15.34]It's got to be a full page ad.
[68:18.93]Advertising a game.
[68:21.20]A game that can be downloaded on the App Store.
[68:23.04]That's the plan.
[68:38.45]Alright, roof is almost done.
[69:04.91]57%?
[69:08.54]57?
[69:17.07]I'll probably get it if I do the other side.
[69:18.37]Alright, I'm gonna speed run this, ready?
[69:22.91]Three, two, one.
[69:38.39]I'm not going that fast.
[69:40.07]Let me try.
[69:49.25]I can't go fast.
[69:56.13]Maybe I can just go fast.
[70:07.58]I can go kind of fast.
[70:12.24]Maybe it's enough to get the ding.
[70:13.32]Because the other side is immaculate.
[70:22.51]What?
[70:42.29]Alright.
[70:49.09]Oh my god.
[70:50.59]Hello, is this the Grind Bandits?
[70:55.61]I need some help with my poor little play school.
[71:00.32]Oh, another thing.
[71:00.84]Carefully go around the volcano.
[71:02.04]Wait, am I getting a bunch of work requests?
[71:11.98]Oh no, it's Tony Hawk.
[71:14.58]Go careful around the volcano.
[71:16.20]What volcano?
[71:19.28]We went down there to enjoy a smoky sunset and Jenny saw a UFO.
[71:23.82]Why am I part of this group text?
[71:25.05]Don't fucking group text me.
[71:26.19]I'm so sick of this shit happening.
[71:28.03]Stop group texting people.
[71:30.15]Don't pull... You know what the dumbest fucking thing... I can't even understand how this was ever a thing.
[71:35.95]You cannot leave a group text if there's people with iPhone and Android.
[71:44.55]Why can't you just leave?
[71:47.49]Why can't you just leave?
[71:49.81]Just leave.
[71:51.65]I don't want to keep getting pulled in.
[71:52.92]People will just be sitting there talking about a bunch of shit.
[72:02.44]And then at some point... Hey, Jeremy.
[72:05.68]What are your thoughts?
[72:07.06]And I'm just like...
[72:10.46]I don't want to tell them that I've had this whole conversation on mute for six or seven straight weeks.
[72:30.38]Why did I give this guy my number?
[72:34.68]Hey, dude, I'm gonna come do a job for you.
[72:36.76]Yeah, that sounds good.
[72:37.72]I'll come do the job for you.
[72:38.78]Here's my rate.
[72:40.16]Hey, man.
[72:40.60]Isn't this kind of an old building?
[72:43.64]Isn't that interesting?
[72:46.68]Yes, it is very interesting.
[72:48.04]Yeah.
[72:49.32]What kind of stone do you think they made this out of?
[72:51.90]I don't know.
[72:56.22]Look, I'm gonna get a text.
[72:56.90]It's gonna be like, what's your favorite pasta?
[73:03.96]And you do, you know, like, uh, rigatoni.
[73:06.18]And then it goes in the pocket.
[73:08.44]Rigatoni in the pocket.
[73:12.19]And then... This guy's gonna start sending me Morse code with the amount of times I'm gonna get a message.
[73:33.27]Go finish the house first.
[73:48.26]Oh, man.
[73:48.80]There's different levels of strength you need.
[73:51.94]Okay.
[73:56.93]Do they still have a UFO here?
[74:01.70]You came back after a year and didn't finish.
[74:07.04]I stomped around in their house, blew out one of their windows, and shoved the nozzle into the chimney, and ruined their furniture in their living room, and then left.
[74:18.80]I'll be back in another year.
[74:35.61]And I'll put the group text thing.
[74:37.29]I don't hate text people.
[74:38.97]I don't hate whatever.
[74:40.07]I just hate telephones.
[74:41.40]I just hate phones.
[74:43.00]You know what is, you know, let me tell you something.
[74:44.60]Some of you kids, you know, back, back in the day, like, you know that everybody has a phone now.
[74:50.78]Everybody will see everything they ever say.
[74:53.18]You know what I mean?
[74:54.10]Even if you don't have read receipts on.
[74:57.24]At least once or twice, at least three or four potential times a day.
[75:01.17]People know that people all look at their phones at least a few times a day.
[75:04.89]So there's no way you didn't see my text, right?
[75:07.23]There's no way you didn't get my phone call.
[75:09.99]See, back in the day, everyone had a landline.
[75:12.51]And it would be as simple as... I don't care.
[75:15.15]I'm not answering that phone.
[75:15.80]And then it was implied that just weren't home.
[75:26.98]Or, sometimes you'd pick the phone up.
[75:29.88]Hello?
[75:31.12]Hi, is, uh, is, uh, is, is, is Jeremy there?
[75:34.70]And... Uh, no, no, he's not here.
[75:38.84]Okay, thanks.
[75:41.60]Easy.
[75:50.94]Now, everybody has a phone.
[75:52.04]Everybody knows you have that phone.
[75:53.58]Everybody knows I have a... Everybody knows you have a phone.
[75:56.39]So you can't... Like... I'm so... I am very notorious for just not responding for a long fucking time.
[76:07.54]I just... And it's not that I don't care.
[76:10.12]It's just like... I don't know what to do.
[76:12.12]I don't know what to say.
[76:29.80]I know you can set up, like, D&D, right?
[76:31.60]Like, do not disturb.
[76:32.42]And, I don't know, shouldn't we all collectively have this message that we all agree on, right?
[76:37.32]Everyone has a message that's a good, it's a separate D&D box that you check.
[76:41.62]And it's just like, look, I'm just kind of don't fucking give a shit right now.
[76:44.63]Like, I don't really, like, want to answer phone calls or, I guess that's what, you know, like, but like a separate, like, less, not, like, serious D&D.
[76:51.45]Like, I just kind of don't care, like, right now.
[76:53.71]Maybe, like, I'll get back to you in a few days.
[76:56.22]Right?
[76:58.02]So if I get that, we all agree on that text, right?
[77:00.72]It's signed into like a Congress gets it and they sign a bill.
[77:03.57]It's just like, alright, we all know that that's like, alright, whatever, I'll talk to you in a few days.
[77:15.11]Or no, it could be just like a single word, like a code word.
[77:17.63]I don't know, peanuts.
[77:22.06]If you get a D&D back, that's just peanuts.
[77:24.84]Oh, alright.
[77:25.30]Yep.
[77:25.96]Got it.
[77:27.22]I got you.
[77:27.74]Don't worry.
[77:28.16]Got it.
[77:39.04]But it sucks, because people would abuse the Peanuts system, right?
[77:43.67]It'd be like, hey, where the fuck is Jeremy?
[77:46.79]Where is he?
[77:52.61]We got Peanutsed.
[77:55.14]It's been three weeks and he won't respond about us going to dinner on Thursday.
[77:59.61]Like, what the hell?
[78:00.61]You're abusing the peanut system.
[78:06.37]And then finally you get back to him and you're like, yeah, sorry, sorry.
[78:09.03]I just kind of was like, dude, I was busy and shit and I didn't really... No one actually cares this much if you don't respond.
[78:30.79]You know what, that's pretty accurate.
[78:32.35]But still though, I never want people to think I don't care.
[78:36.71]I do care.
[78:37.35]But like sometimes I'll get a text and then I'll have like Cathy Mitchell on the iPad and it's just like... I... Fuck.
[78:50.68]But I don't even know, I... And for some reason my brain says, just press play again and just relax.
[79:01.70]It sucks.
[79:02.18]I hate it.
[79:08.52]Because in my brain, in my... I don't know.
[79:11.28]Maybe I'm weird.
[79:13.34]But to me, putting on like D&D to me and like sending a D&D automatic response back to somebody is almost like a... Okay.
[79:21.90]Automatic response.
[79:22.66]Not going to even text me back.
[79:24.34]I get like an auto-generated message.
[79:29.95]Like, hey, what are you up to?
[79:30.69]I'm sorry, that person is not available to speak right now.
[79:32.67]Maybe he'll talk to you later.
[79:33.65]Okay.
[79:37.73]Sure.
[79:52.72]Auto-generated.
[79:54.20]And let me be also Frank, too.
[79:55.74]I talk to a lot of people every day.
[80:01.03]I'm usually on the phone at least four or five times a day.
[80:09.34]That's a flex?
[80:10.34]What?
[80:10.70]Is that a flex?
[80:14.47]I just talked to a lot of different people!
[80:31.35]Weird flex.
[80:32.25]What are my favorite color schemes, by the way?
[80:59.97]He talks to people, but he doesn't... He never wants to talk back to people.
[81:09.98]No, I don't just want to talk at people.
[81:12.30]And so it's like, when I call you, you answer.
[81:14.42]When I text you, you answer.
[81:16.56]I get it too.
[81:17.32]If I don't get a response, I'm just like, alright, cool.
[81:18.82]I'll see you, I'll talk to you, whatever.
[81:24.64]I'm not demanding that they give me their time.
[81:26.76]I'm just saying that I have... You know what I mean?
[81:29.64]You get it.
[81:46.19]You missed a spot.
[81:48.10]This one's going to take a while.
[81:49.12]This is... Oh...
[81:58.11]So you know what I could do here, right?
[81:59.63]Check this out.
[82:00.62]Alright, you ready?
[82:09.99]Make sure that looks good.
[82:17.92]Okay, so right here, I could take a picture right here, just of this.
[82:26.80]Me standing in front of it, being like... It's like, yeah, just cleaning it up at Dave's Skate Park.
[82:37.86]Really showing him how to do a clean job, right?
[82:40.22]Arms folded, like this.
[82:42.25]And the power washer's leaning behind me, and there's an ad for my business right there.
[82:46.29]And what they don't know is that this is all this.
[82:50.90]And I get to about here.
[82:52.78]And I'm just like, I'm done.
[83:00.08]There's some dirt still on the wall.
[83:04.86]Oh yeah, take the photo here.
[83:06.66]And have me stand there.
[83:07.58]And then crop the absolute hell out of this.
[83:09.44]And zoom in so it's blurry and artifacted.
[83:12.73]And then somebody gets the original photo and leaks the original photo.
[83:22.20]Now, is that a dumb viral marketing campaign that would be bad for my business?
[83:26.15]Or... What?
[83:29.39]I wonder.
[83:43.07]They would be such an epic troll.
[84:12.01]Still 1%?
[84:12.37]Oh god.
[84:16.09]Use the big nozzle?
[84:19.63]The big nozzle doesn't get everything.
[84:24.77]Do I have access to different nozzles?
[84:32.20]Is there a bigger one?
[84:40.06]Where can I buy stuff?
[84:41.93]Is there a store?
[84:42.97]How do I buy something?
[84:49.27]Where's the store?
[84:50.75]It's somewhere, right?
[85:00.71]Where is it?
[85:01.57]Oh, right here.
[85:03.21]Oh, alright.
[85:04.75]Okay.
[85:06.25]Heavy duty?
[85:07.87]Shit, I need 40 stars.
[85:15.46]Dude, these... Oh my god, there's like skins.
[85:26.42]Ooh, alright.
[85:27.45]Hold on.
[85:29.17]I don't want to spend any money, though.
[85:33.61]No, I don't want to spend any money.
[85:36.89]Should I get some... Some soap?
[85:41.19]What kind of surface is this?
[85:42.94]Is this plastic?
[85:43.76]What is this?
[85:44.86]Steel?
[85:46.30]Granite?
[85:46.66]What is this?
[85:47.34]What is it?
[85:47.64]Aluminum or something?
[85:48.58]What is all this?
[85:52.34]Concrete?
[85:57.14]Oh, it says multi-purpose.
[85:58.44]Okay.
[86:00.02]So I need multi-purpose cleaner.
[86:08.39]Multi-purpose.
[86:12.20]Should I have bought that much?
[86:13.90]Alright, so now what does that do?
[86:14.80]Okay, now how do I put the cleaning liquid on?
[86:24.73]No cleaner attached.
[86:25.69]How do I do that?
[86:32.39]I have like five.
[86:34.42]Press three.
[86:36.08]Oh, okay, cool.
[86:40.70]Is it on?
[86:44.34]Multi-purpose cleaner.
[86:45.14]I have to buy the attachment.
[86:51.30]You need the soap nozzle.
[86:53.18]Oh, okay.
[86:58.58]75 bucks!
[87:01.98]I already own it.
[87:14.83]Change to it?
[87:17.29]You own it for the other washer.
[87:19.93]Oh, it's for the other one.
[87:23.52]Wait, what?
[87:26.86]Oh, really?
[87:28.04]Hold on.
[87:28.40]I can't get it for the other one?
[87:34.80]Huh, okay.
[87:35.62]So it's for the other one.
[87:39.33]Well, let me try it.
[87:44.06]Give me the stub.
[87:45.22]Stubby.
[87:46.00]Alright.
[88:03.97]What's this doing?
[88:07.94]I can get it for the other gun.
[88:10.48]This actually kind of works.
[88:12.68]Alright, wait.
[88:13.00]Get it for the other gun?
[88:14.16]How much money do I have?
[88:27.75]Okay, so equipment, right?
[88:28.45]Oh, $375.
[88:28.53]I don't have enough of that.
[88:44.43]I might as well use it.
[89:06.02]So this just makes it easier to do?
[89:09.52]Rinse it.
[89:10.12]Finish the house.
[89:14.44]I'll go back in a year.
[89:23.93]I'll go back in like a year.
[89:32.11]This doesn't do anything?
[89:33.59]That is way more than I've done in an hour sitting in the corner.
[89:47.79]This is doing way more than I was doing.
[89:52.65]Now rinse it.
[90:02.60]Do I have to rinse it?
[90:11.28]I don't think so.
[90:12.02]No.
[90:14.10]I'm going to use the rest of it.
[90:16.83]Should I go?
[90:17.21]Alright.
[90:17.61]Should I go back to the house?
[90:18.91]Alright, I'll go back to the house.
[90:20.05]I'll go back to the house.
[90:21.03]I'll come back to this one later.
[90:22.15]I'll be fine.
[90:27.99]Soap only gets most of it off the weaker one.
[90:29.51]Okay.
[90:32.89]Hey, look at this place!
[90:33.79]This place looks beautiful!
[90:40.12]So this is wood.
[90:41.52]Will multipurpose work on wood?
[90:45.46]Probably not, right?
[90:50.56]That's actually really good here.
[90:51.84]Alright, give me the ladder.
[90:52.95]Alright.
[91:12.14]Can I put the ladder over here?
[91:13.26]I can.
[91:17.80]Alright, what the hell am I doing?
[91:23.57]Oh my god, that's so much easier.
[91:27.21]Alright.
[91:28.27]I almost have the whole chimney.
[91:34.15]This doesn't work.
[91:34.69]This doesn't work here.
[91:35.85]It works on the chimney.
[91:48.24]How?
[91:49.00]My ladder's not big enough.
[91:58.07]The ladder's not big enough to get all the way up here.
[92:07.61]This side, the one facing the neighbor here.
[92:15.94]Jerma, are you high on bath salts?
[92:17.98]No!
[92:18.40]What?
[92:20.44]There it is.
[92:22.28]Got it.
[92:23.68]Okay, now... I want wood.
[92:28.25]I want wood cleaner.
[92:29.27]I feel like it's going to be amazing.
[92:32.15]Stone cleaner?
[92:34.23]No.
[92:34.37]Alright, let me buy some wood cleaner.
[92:39.59]Wood cleaner.
[92:40.53]There it is.
[92:42.21]Let's see if this works.
[92:45.75]Wood cleaner.
[92:46.89]It's on.
[92:47.45]Fill it up.
[92:48.41]And let's go.
[92:52.79]Works pretty good.
[93:01.44]Maybe that's got a great sound effect too.
[93:03.80]That's got an amazing sound effect.
[93:11.77]Get off the fucking ladder, you idiot!
[93:13.90]What have I done?
[93:14.88]I just like ran into it and hit my head on it.
[93:36.57]Looking good so far.
[93:44.31]Just leave an outline of the ladder.
[93:50.71]That'd be so stupid.
[93:53.25]Alright, I gotta go for the corner here.
[93:58.32]That's alright.
[94:12.17]Now we move the ladder?
[94:12.97]Actually, maybe not.
[94:18.57]Hell, this is the way to do it.
[94:21.39]This is the way to do it.
[94:25.47]For sure.
[94:25.89]I still have cleaner left, right?
[94:28.89]Yep.
[94:31.23]That took me two minutes.
[94:32.83]Two minutes!
[94:49.67]Oh, that's perfect.
[94:50.47]Alright, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[94:57.81]Alright, move the ladder.
[95:05.29]Come on.
[95:06.91]Come on!
[95:10.83]Crap.
[95:11.27]It's okay.
[95:13.71]It'll ding any second.
[95:19.49]That scared the shit out of me.
[95:31.17]Alright, any more soap I can use.
[95:33.73]This is multi-purpose.
[95:35.91]Okay, this is... How is this... This is wood?
[95:39.65]Okay, it's all... Oh, yeah.
[95:40.92]Let's refill that.
[95:42.44]Yep.
[95:42.90]Fill it back up.
[95:45.28]Buy some more of that right now.
[95:51.92]Just buy it all.
[95:52.44]Whatever.
[95:59.74]Check this out.
[96:06.46]I'm spending money.
[96:08.04]How much money am I spending?
[96:09.12]Oh.
[96:10.61]That was 50 bucks.
[96:17.21]I'll make it last.
[96:18.11]And then I'll come back and just touch it up.
[96:19.81]I'll touch it up.
[96:38.86]How is this wood?
[96:39.60]This looks like stone.
[96:40.52]Is this wood?
[96:44.83]Don't walk under the ladder.
[96:47.23]I'll throw a fucking salt behind me.
[96:48.81]I'll be fine.
[96:49.21]I'm going to ask you a question.
[96:54.36]So if I walked under a ladder, and... Okay, if I walked through the ladder, but I walked backwards through the ladder, does that negate it?
[97:06.01]Is that like, just like, okay, you went back.
[97:07.19]You undued.
[97:08.51]Is that an undo?
[97:13.08]No.
[97:14.12]Okay, so if I go through the ladder, then I take salt and I go like that.
[97:17.98]Wait, wrong shoulder.
[97:19.42]Like that.
[97:20.90]Would that undo going through the ladder?
[97:32.34]No, it doesn't.
[97:33.50]The salt has no effect.
[97:35.56]So what would negate going underneath the ladder?
[97:47.87]Nothing.
[97:49.25]Nothing.
[97:49.51]There's literally nothing you can do.
[97:51.55]I feel like there's something you can do.
[97:52.99]That's not how it works.
[98:02.37]What's wrong with going under a ladder?
[98:04.47]Somebody tell him.
[98:06.09]Somebody tell that.
[98:06.83]Somebody tell that guy.
[98:07.85]Somebody tell him.
[98:13.19]It's a hundred years bad luck.
[98:18.05]So if you walked under a ladder, broke a mirror, threw salt over your left shoulder, opened up an umbrella, closed it, opened up an umbrella, do you just get struck by lightning right after doing that?
[98:39.74]It's a cheat code.
[98:43.40]It's funny because I... I'm not superstitious at all.
[98:50.35]But I... doesn't matter.
[98:52.03]I still wouldn't open up an umbrella inside the house.
[98:56.91]Right?
[99:04.02]But I'm not super... I don't... I'm not... I just... just in case.
[99:09.47]What if just in case?
[99:12.74]Like, I would not right now open a umbrella in this room.
[99:16.92]I just... It's not that, oh my god, I believe in that.
[99:20.18]But I just, I don't know.
[99:21.00]I'm afraid of it.
[99:21.72]What if it's real?
[99:24.42]What if it is bad luck?
[99:30.94]This house looks like shit.
[99:34.58]Alright, we got all... I soaked it up.
[99:35.76]Is there any more wood I can do?
[99:39.91]This is... No, this is multi-purpose.
[99:41.41]Alright, well, get rid of the wood one.
[99:44.91]Now we're going to bring the nozzle back out.
[99:51.64]Okay, I don't want to clean it.
[99:52.50]Let's put the nozzles back on.
[99:53.82]I want... Where is my actual... Where is it?
[100:01.52]What?
[100:02.22]Oh.
[100:06.40]How do I get to the nozzle?
[100:07.32]There we go, here.
[100:09.63]Alright.
[100:10.09]Medium duty.
[100:11.65]This one has extension, though.
[100:13.23]I'm going to put this one on.
[100:21.34]I have to piss.
[100:22.56]Can I go pee?
[100:24.98]I got to pee.
[100:26.40]I'll be right back.
[100:26.88]I got to pee.
[100:27.94]And I'm finishing this house and I'm finishing the Gostron skate park.
[100:30.74]I'll be right back.
[100:34.04]I'm going to pee.
[104:56.63]Alright, I'm back.
[104:58.23]How are you?
[105:05.34]How's it going?
[105:06.50]You guys ready for more power washing?
[105:08.06]I am.
[105:12.02]You forgot to mute.
[105:12.70]We heard every last drop.
[105:14.56]You're disgusting.
[105:16.13]You're disgusting.
[105:18.07]Disgusting.
[105:19.19]Disgusting chatter.
[105:20.21]Disgusting chatter.
[105:21.19]Disgusting chatter.
[105:22.93]Get rid of them.
[105:24.01]Disgusting chatter.
[105:37.32]Alright.
[105:38.08]Let's do it.
[105:43.62]Back to the house.
[105:44.86]How much more of the house do I have to do?
[105:48.70]Realistically.
[105:51.20]I'm at 73%.
[105:52.20]Do I get extra money for finishing the job?
[105:54.02]I better.
[105:55.98]I better.
[106:00.56]This got louder to me.
[106:02.44]Have I just gotten used to that sound?
[106:06.74]Did I get used to that sound effect?
[106:12.89]What about baseball?
[106:13.53]Baseball.
[106:14.81]The Jerma Baseball Association had its date changed to August 19th.
[106:20.79]I know.
[106:21.85]Sadge is in the chat.
[106:22.93]I know.
[106:24.93]But that is set in stone.
[106:26.19]We're ready to go.
[106:29.82]This time, I mean it.
[106:32.13]This time, I mean it.
[106:43.90]You said that last time.
[106:45.08]Yeah, but this would be Strike 3.
[106:46.66]This would be literally Strike 3.
[107:00.24]Set in stone.
[107:01.40]No, it's set in stone.
[107:03.26]This has been etched.
[107:09.79]Into an etched sketch.
[107:10.59]So you can just literally go like this and it just changes.
[107:20.93]Dang.
[107:30.56]Get that.
[107:34.43]He's gonna delay it again.
[107:35.25]I... No, I can't.
[107:39.13]So, if this gets delayed again, it's not going to happen until probably the fall.
[107:46.84]There's no way.
[107:48.82]There is not a chance it gets delayed again.
[107:50.70]And I'm telling you, there's no way.
[107:55.56]No way.
[107:56.39]No way.
[107:57.53]No way.
[107:59.03]There is literally no way.
[108:06.91]I know that's Copium, but there's no way.
[108:21.76]Tag me.
[108:22.34]Oh yeah, somebody has an account that says that.
[108:29.51]Somebody has an account that's tag me when Jerma lies.
[108:32.77]That person has probably not logged into Twitch in like five years.
[108:40.74]That account is probably inactive.
[108:43.94]It's probably been inactive for months, if not years.
[108:58.84]They were here yesterday?
[109:00.36]Were they actually here?
[109:11.14]Well, whoever this is, they're going to wake up one day and have 5,000 pings on their dashboard.
[109:24.57]You know what?
[109:26.19]I can't even buy anymore.
[109:27.17]Never mind.
[109:42.10]How does anyone know what the stream is?
[109:44.34]What do you mean?
[109:46.72]What happened?
[109:51.68]What happened?
[110:00.68]Can you explain why it got delayed?
[110:02.28]Sure.
[110:02.42]One, two, three.
[110:09.43]It could have happened on that date, but it would have been a show that was worse than the show I wanted to do.
[110:17.44]We were pretty much ready to go.
[110:18.80]We had a couple of issues that we had some venue problems, right?
[110:26.92]So instead of just doing it with those venue problems, I was like, you know what?
[110:33.99]Let's just make sure that we can do the thing that I want to do.
[110:39.90]It would have been fine, maybe, but... After August and into September, I'm gonna be able to look back and go, I'm so glad we waited till August.
[110:54.07]This whole process of trying to get a venue, right?
[110:58.97]Was way more difficult than I think anybody anticipated.
[111:02.11]So...
[111:04.85]We got one.
[111:05.33]Then we got another one.
[111:06.69]Then we got told we couldn't do it at one place.
[111:10.36]Then we got told we couldn't do it at another place.
[111:12.70]And then we had a date, and then that date had to change with this place.
[111:16.84]And so then we had to look and see if we could go somewhere else.
[111:19.12]And it was like, no, I don't want to do that.
[111:22.35]So we ended up picking a new place for August.
[111:27.43]That's pretty much what happened.
[111:43.58]But it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[111:46.43]I've been waiting to do this stream for almost two years.
[111:50.25]So, when we finally get out there, I'm gonna be as happy as can be.
[112:02.91]Ding.
[112:08.05]Alright, at what point can I close the job?
[112:09.89]80%?
[112:09.91]90%?
[112:09.93]100%?
[112:09.95]When do I get to go?
[112:14.91]Alright, that's it.
[112:17.61]You're on your own.
[112:18.31]100?
[112:20.20]Aww.
[112:20.48]Alright, I'm focusing.
[112:23.88]Here we go.
[112:24.90]Focus up.
[112:30.74]Focus up.
[112:33.16]Always give 110%, Jerry.
[112:52.43]I don't know.
[112:55.27]As long as I feel like it.
[113:03.82]Don't mean to be a Debbie Downer, but I've looked into the creepy symbols you found on the side of that house you're working on.
[113:10.38]It's the demon person!
[113:14.74]Turns out they're just builder's diagrams to- oh.
[113:18.24]Telling the plumber where to put the gap for the overfill.
[113:31.05]Never mind.
[113:36.95]Never mind.
[113:43.20]80%.
[113:43.84]Is this the first job I will ever complete in this game?
[113:58.64]Switch to a different nozzle.
[114:00.70]Yeah, I like the green one.
[114:02.38]The green one's just enough pressure, but it's not too much.
[114:14.68]This one has a good surface area, but it doesn't get down deep.
[114:17.65]And you have to pass through three times anyways.
[114:19.05]Hey, can you do the cat puke noise?
[114:23.71]What is that?
[114:27.09]What are you talking about?
[114:31.65]I'm gonna sponsored fucking stream.
[114:32.93]Shut up.
[114:45.39]That looks alright.
[115:06.96]Call for a vote?
[115:08.30]What are we voting on?
[115:18.54]This thing goes... This is the long-range nozzle.
[115:21.24]That's what's going on here.
[115:22.16]I was like, holy shit, this is awesome.
[115:24.54]Why did I not have something from the very beginning?
[115:32.24]I could do the whole house like this.
[115:45.92]That's so much.
[115:46.60]Alright, this will be done in 10 minutes.
[115:47.98]Not even.
[115:49.44]A pole to do cat puke.
[115:50.78]No, that's on me if I want to do that.
[115:53.79]Whatever that is.
[115:56.21]Whatever that could be.
[115:57.05]That's something I've never heard of.
[116:00.87]Whatever that is.
[116:01.49]I don't know.
[116:01.81]It's something strange apparently.
[116:21.57]Nice.
[116:22.91]So much quicker.
[116:29.12]Come on, just get... Wait, I can use the spinner.
[116:38.00]This is my favorite weapon.
[116:39.52]Well, it's not a weapon, but you know what I mean?
[116:40.72]It's my favorite attachment, I would say.
[116:44.40]Don't call it a weapon.
[116:46.70]It's not a weapon.
[116:58.77]Favorite weapon.
[117:01.65]Got it.
[117:02.15]Plus, that's two bucks.
[117:03.69]That's two bucks.
[117:21.39]Two bucks.
[117:33.50]Almost at 90% Let's go!
[117:36.42]Let's go!
[117:37.38]Let's go!
[117:38.36]Let's go!
[117:38.72]I almost puked Yeah, I almost cat-puked, you're right
[118:09.85]How much more of this before I get a ding?
[118:12.91]I'm being dead serious.
[118:15.20]There it is.
[118:15.58]I gotta get underneath.
[118:32.53]Ding.
[118:45.08]Looks so much better.
[118:46.96]So much better.
[118:47.64]God, can we see the before and after photos?
[118:54.43]What a difference.
[118:55.83]What a difference that made, huh?
[118:57.23]What a change.
[118:57.63]What a difference.
[119:09.76]What a difference.
[119:32.33]What?!
[119:50.69]When is this gonna ding?
[119:54.33]Somebody said, why are you so tall?
[119:56.87]Holy shit, he's huge!
[120:06.98]I just realized I'm seven plus feet tall.
[120:10.76]What?
[120:15.75]There it is.
[120:16.73]There's the ding.
[120:17.77]By the way, can we, in the chat, can we tell everybody where they can get this?
[120:22.57]PowerWash Simulator.
[120:26.45]Where can you get it?
[120:26.99]And by the way, I got a terrible job I've done.
[120:30.76]What an awful job I've done.
[120:35.54]Imagine if you could show me up on your own game.
[120:44.05]Such a fucking two-year-old.
[121:20.55]I'm 90% sure it's on Xbox.
[121:22.25]You're right.
[121:24.93]Xbox X. Xbox Series S. Steam.
[121:29.43]It's on that PC of yours.
[121:33.26]I believe it's also on Game Pass.
[121:35.56]Potentially too.
[121:36.76]We're going to figure that one out.
[121:50.91]Ding.
[121:52.13]More dings.
[121:54.45]Yeah, it's on Game Pass.
[121:55.69]Yes!
[121:59.82]You just downloaded from Game Pass?
[122:02.41]Hell yeah.
[122:21.56]260.
[122:21.58]What do I need?
[122:21.88]375?
[122:21.90]I want a different nozzle.
[123:02.09]What did I do?
[123:02.85]You made somebody cry.
[123:03.75]I made somebody cry at Dave and Buster's.
[123:06.00]You made my little sister cry at Dave and Buster's.
[123:08.40]You called her crying Andy and she cried.
[123:11.66]Just delete this.
[123:12.72]What is this?
[123:13.22]... ... ...
[123:34.11]They're still not?
[123:34.71]Okay, come on.
[123:36.25]There it is.
[123:36.69]Alright.
[123:38.01]What is missing on this side?
[123:39.50]This side looks good besides this.
[123:40.58]This looks awful, but, you know, whatever.
[123:41.86]It's fine.
[123:57.20]Wait, you can get this on Steam Deck?
[124:11.93]That wasn't a bad first pass.
[124:24.51]Come on!
[124:36.44]Why does it feel like this setting I would be like...
[124:40.10]I wouldn't be able to control this.
[124:42.02]My armor would be moving all... This is a lot of power behind this.
[124:52.71]Do this to your house in real life.
[125:00.95]There it is.
[125:01.31]Alright.
[125:01.73]Now... Wait, this side too.
[125:04.62]90%.
[125:04.66]Come on.
[125:05.56]It's just the roof.
[125:21.26]Get in there.
[125:29.11]Nice.
[125:29.43]I haven't got a ding in a while.
[125:43.36]Kind of getting a little pissed off about it, if I'm honest.
[125:48.74]Thank you.
[125:51.39]Thank you.
[126:01.58]Can you get this on a Samsung fridge?
[126:12.17]Why is there just a... I don't know.
[126:16.77]I don't know if you can get this on a fridge.
[126:20.73]That has not been playtested, I don't think so.
[126:22.46]That's at your own risk.
[126:49.32]It's fridge compatible?
[126:51.14]Did you do it?
[126:56.02]They said it's fridge compatible.
[126:57.40]POG.
[126:58.32]That's not official.
[126:59.38]That's not an official statement.
[127:01.56]One guy in chat said that.
[127:05.47]I don't know what that means.
[127:14.59]How did I not do this already?
[127:25.94]This hedge ruined everything.
[127:37.54]Come on, really?
[127:43.06]Alright.
[127:44.94]Oh.
[127:45.52]Ooh.
[127:46.18]That was supposed to be a joke, but that actually just... I did that for real.
[127:48.86]That hurt.
[127:50.44]Ow.
[127:55.14]I did that for a joke.
[128:01.39]Ladder.
[128:08.47]Now it's just the roof, right?
[128:09.29]And that's it?
[128:25.40]Broke your finger?
[128:26.10]I'm fine.
[128:26.54]It didn't even hurt.
[128:37.65]This was blowing out my microphone, right?
[128:40.53]Because that was disgusting.
[128:45.52]That definitely covered it up.
[128:48.48]I just did this internal burp and it was like... I'm glad you didn't hear it because this... Yeah.
[129:06.06]Thank God I have this loud white noise just playing in the background so you didn't hear that.
[129:22.04]He farted.
[129:25.13]I didn't.
[129:25.61]Stop saying that.
[129:39.98]What's left up here?
[129:41.14]Oh, the gutter.
[129:42.08]Right.
[129:51.84]Can I hold shift and not fall off like Minecraft?
[130:12.37]This is really, really on there.
[130:24.23]What is this, algae?
[130:37.06]Is that, was that algae?
[130:37.82]That's what it looks like.
[130:52.84]Did I get it all?
[130:54.41]There's still some here.
[130:55.17]Hold on.
[130:55.57]Let me crouch.
[130:58.65]I got it all.
[131:01.76]This is actually a really good angle for this.
[131:15.78]You're floating?
[131:16.54]No, I'm all the way at the end.
[131:19.09]My big toe is over here.
[131:20.27]I'm fine.
[131:25.69]This angle is perfect, though.
[131:27.05]I can get all up in there.
[131:42.57]Okay, there's nothing else over here.
[131:43.77]92%.
[131:43.79]Alright, I gotta get the algae in there.
[131:47.51]I already got all that.
[131:50.67]Not over here, though.
[131:51.37]Hold on.
[132:08.87]Dang.
[132:19.31]No ding?
[132:33.22]Where's the ding?
[132:39.40]No ding.
[132:46.05]Dude, no ding.
[132:56.58]No ding.
[133:08.71]Here we go.
[133:09.23]Alright.
[133:09.73]I'm in.
[133:09.93]Yeah, this is algae.
[133:11.53]Okay.
[133:29.42]Alright.
[133:30.76]What is left besides the very top of the roof here?
[133:33.60]This... Oh, that looks bad.
[133:34.56]What besides this?
[133:35.34]There's nothing else.
[133:35.86]There's a whole left wall?
[133:55.54]Bro, that's a shadow.
[134:07.36]Bro.
[134:24.55]303.
[134:24.85]Do I actually get a bonus for this?
[134:30.75]If I complete the whole thing.
[134:41.30]You've been doing this for two hours?
[134:43.88]Yeah, I'm having fun.
[134:50.79]It gives you a message.
[134:51.63]Ooh, I got it.
[134:53.37]40 bucks.
[134:54.33]Hell yeah.
[134:54.79]Come on.
[134:55.75]I want to buy that new nozzle.
[135:23.16]Yes.
[135:28.40]Yes.
[135:33.73]Yes.
[135:42.65]Yes.
[135:43.75]Ah.
[135:57.45]Real voice?
[136:00.49]Let me talk in my real voice.
[136:02.23]I'm going to talk just in my real voice.
[136:04.99]No messing around.
[136:05.77]No putting on a projection to talk into a microphone or talk.
[136:12.01]So this is what I normally talk like.
[136:14.73]This is how I just normally speak to somebody.
[136:16.34]If I'm talking to somebody, this is how I just normally will talk.
[136:19.88]I'll be like, what's up, man?
[136:20.86]What are you up to?
[136:22.87]Nothing.
[136:23.31]Are you doing that thing on Friday?
[136:26.85]I was thinking about going, but I'm not sure.
[136:32.27]Are you... Yeah.
[136:38.50]Are you... I can pick you up.
[136:40.40]I can pick you up at like 8.
[136:42.18]No.
[136:45.00]Yeah.
[136:48.84]Sure.
[136:49.24]Sure.
[136:49.48]Yeah.
[136:49.96]I mean, we can get breakfast if you want.
[136:54.43]We can just get breakfast and shit.
[136:59.90]I was gonna do it again, but I'm like, nah, I'm not doing it again. 95%.
[137:26.46]96% it's just this side right here.
[137:29.14]That's it 97 98 99
[138:01.16]It's coming Come on 99 still
[138:35.99]100... You thought dirt and grime could hide from me?
[139:06.55]This is where it shows a bunch of animated dirt.
[139:09.03]And they're all hiding under the railing.
[139:11.39]It'll never get us here!
[139:12.86]We're caked on algae!
[139:15.08]And then it blasts!
[139:21.72]Our washers use the strongest nozzles.
[139:24.54]Able to take six coats of paint off.
[139:40.37]Our nozzles are so strong.
[139:42.53]We can turn steel back to its original element.
[139:49.67]Iron and copper.
[139:51.25]It splits the atoms or whatever it does.
[139:53.13]Wait, what is steel?
[139:55.33]Carbon.
[139:55.91]Fuck.
[139:56.23]I fucked that whole joke up.
[139:57.33]You know what I mean, though.
[140:00.63]Iron and copper.
[140:01.59]I've played too many mobile games, guys.
[140:03.31]It's one bar of copper, one bar of iron.
[140:05.49]And you put them together and it turns into steel.
[140:09.68]Window frames?
[140:17.96]Where are these trims?
[140:19.70]Wooden trim.
[140:23.38]There it is.
[140:28.35]How do you make steel?
[140:29.61]Steel is aluminum.
[140:32.66]Okay, so what's a better joke?
[140:35.12]I can bring a material that's combined metals down to their periodic table version.
[140:45.59]Carbon and iron.
[140:47.65]So a better thing would be like, our nozzles are so strong.
[140:51.43]Our nozzles are so strong, we could turn steel back into carbon and iron.
[141:03.82]Would that be better?
[141:13.06]Why did you say copper?
[141:13.84]Why did you say carbon and iron?
[141:17.85]Split bronze into copper and tin.
[141:24.81]Did I get it wrong?
[141:35.34]No, you were correct.
[141:39.15]Left side window.
[141:52.59]Ah.
[141:52.65]99.
[141:58.42]I'm so stressed out.
[141:59.60]Relax, we're fine.
[142:05.45]Rail- Oh, here we go.
[142:30.44]A nozzle like this would fuck this up.
[142:32.74]Probably.
[142:35.31]Iron and carbon is steel.
[142:36.71]Steel is mostly iron.
[142:37.99]It's about 98% iron.
[142:43.07]Alright, so I wasn't wrong.
[142:50.72]I physically can't get over here.
[142:52.66]Hold on.
[142:53.14]Yes, I can.
[143:07.89]Another railing.
[143:14.94]More window trims?
[143:16.20]Oh, come on.
[143:22.37]Wait, that's it.
[143:23.01]Alright.
[143:23.57]Now window trim.
[143:29.75]You should say it splits atoms.
[143:31.21]I have to...
[143:34.58]It's like an image of the guy shooting the power washer.
[143:37.38]And he's like... And all of a sudden you see... Like a mushroom cloud?
[143:46.26]I don't think I would want that.
[143:56.03]Window trim.
[143:57.97]Yeah, there's a couple windows here.
[144:01.11]Up here?
[144:04.65]No, not this one.
[144:08.53]Wooden trim.
[144:09.82]Oh, it's not window trim.
[144:10.98]It's wooden trim.
[144:18.60]Wooden trim.
[144:20.78]And railing.
[144:21.42]Which railing?
[144:21.88]This one?
[144:28.21]There it is.
[144:36.06]Shit, I gotta go down here.
[144:50.45]I'm almost at 100.
[144:50.83]Yes.
[144:50.91]Yeah.
[144:59.56]Yeah.
[145:09.43]Yes.
[145:12.38]Yeah.
[145:20.40]Only a few more.
[145:20.90]And I got a hundred percent on the house.
[145:36.42]Very nice.
[145:44.04]There's three more.
[145:44.76]Where?
[145:45.92]Where?
[145:51.25]Last one.
[145:53.81]Extra hundred bucks.
[146:02.04]And we gotta get our... Hold on.
[146:02.90]We gotta do our post-shave rinse, right?
[146:17.92]Looks good.
[146:18.34]Get the bladder out of the way.
[146:19.22]I want a picture.
[146:19.64]Okay.
[146:28.19]No, wait.
[146:28.91]It's your perspective, so it'll be like this.
[146:34.49]Hey.
[146:41.02]Alright.
[146:43.39]Wait, this is from a year ago.
[146:44.47]This is literally from a year ago, the front part.
[146:47.17]It's saved for a year.
[146:55.90]Wait, hold on.
[147:00.25]It actually kept it from a year ago.
[147:05.07]Why... Hold on, but why did I exist later?
[147:08.37]How come I was walking around?
[147:09.61]Who is this walking around?
[147:20.32]They grow up so fast.
[147:22.48]Alright, I got some money now.
[147:26.09]Let's go back to the skate park.
[147:30.19]Steel is... Yeah, steel is iron.
[147:36.27]Alright, here we go.
[147:39.16]They added a player model and a patch.
[147:40.72]Oh, that's funny.
[147:42.86]Okay, here we go.
[147:47.08]Update the nozzle.
[147:47.80]I think it's time.
[147:50.97]Heavy duty?
[147:53.51]Two thousand dollars.
[147:55.45]I don't have that.
[147:56.31]Five grand?
[147:57.20]Alright, I'm not fucking around anymore.
[148:03.58]I'm not messing around anymore.
[148:04.48]We need to get money.
[148:05.10]Let's go.
[148:05.44]Ready?
[148:10.17]Um... I need... I need some... I need some... I need some go fast music.
[148:16.79]Multi-purpose.
[148:17.41]I'm gonna soap the whole thing.
[148:20.34]You ready?
[148:21.88]No, not DOOM OST.
[148:23.28]Something that is royalty free.
[148:27.54]It's gotta be something royalty free.
[148:30.84]Is penis music royalty free?
[148:32.58]Definitely not.
[148:33.18]I don't know why that's what I wanted to put on here.
[148:41.81]Put on Sonic X?
[148:45.01]I mean, it's video game music.
[148:46.39]Alright, whatever.
[148:55.29]Put on the Flintstones SNES.
[148:56.69]Alright, hold on.
[149:01.89]Let me get something.
[149:03.61]Let's do, um... What do you think?
[149:11.77]No, not Break Core.
[149:15.97]Why would Sonic doesn't make sense?
[149:21.59]Put on the one Sonic song and just put it on repeat.
[149:25.64]Flintstones SNES.
[149:28.75]I'm curious of what this is.
[149:32.27]What is this Flintstones SNES OS2?
[149:37.29]I've never played this game before.
[149:38.77]Flintstones?
[149:49.22]By the way, this is the movie version of the Flintstones.
[149:55.29]Holy shit, this is fucking awesome.
[149:59.43]What the hell?
[150:00.37]Who made this?
[150:01.01]This is great.
[150:10.34]Oh, hold on.
[150:10.82]Let's start this over.
[150:13.18]When you meet the Flintstones, you'll learn a story.
[150:21.00]Let's do that one more time.
[150:29.03]This just blows it out.
[150:29.81]Hold on.
[150:37.88]The skin on my mouth is coming off.
[150:50.74]What am I doing?
[150:51.24]Let's go over here.
[150:51.83]I need soap.
[150:57.97]What just happened?
[151:03.85]This sounds like a really shitty version of this because of the white noise.
[151:23.69]Wilma!
[151:26.29]How long do I think I can hold a Wilma for?
[152:17.08]That was fucking long, dude.
[152:24.37]How long was that?
[152:25.13]That was at least like 30 seconds.
[152:30.61]That had to have been at least 20 to 30 seconds.
[152:37.01]That was a flash... You flash banged us?
[152:45.39]Is this Fred Flintstone?
[152:56.19]Dude, did I get the longest Wilma world record right there?
[152:59.69]I want to buy the soap.
[153:10.21]Multi-purpose.
[153:18.60]This song is amazing.
[153:27.75]Shit, I'm spending money.
[153:33.63]That was like a minute?
[153:36.03]That was 45 seconds.
[153:38.71]What?
[153:50.29]Based on the clip, that was 45 straight seconds.
[153:57.81]Do I submit that somewhere?
[153:58.73]Alright, I don't want wood cleaner.
[154:17.59]I want multi-purpose cleaner.
[154:23.05]This soundtrack is actually really good.
[154:24.11]Alright, I'm gonna start... Let's get this whole quadrant done.
[154:32.27]Like, from here to here.
[154:33.76]I'm gonna draw a line, essentially.
[154:35.66]So from here... To here.
[154:39.94]Ready?
[154:51.15]This OST fucks.
[154:55.25]It does.
[154:58.13]Hey, we're playing Power War Simulator.
[155:04.20]Check it out.
[155:10.38]This actually cleans really well.
[155:16.41]Multi-purpose still, right?
[155:17.25]Yep.
[155:21.69]Oh, I thought it said dirty steak.
[155:35.29]I want to check out some of the other little modes, too.
[155:36.73]There's a couple other modes I want to see.
[155:38.87]Okay, after the skate park, I'll check out some of the other modes.
[155:48.76]I'm actually going to really try to get this done quickly.
[155:54.98]Quadrant by quadrant.
[155:58.60]I don't want to go too far.
[155:59.36]I'm going too far now.
[156:04.12]Already looking way better.
[156:05.56]Right here.
[156:05.82]There's the line right here.
[156:15.00]We're gonna go over this again.
[156:17.18]With the actual nozzle.
[156:24.22]And from this line... I'm gonna draw the line here.
[156:26.70]Ready?
[156:27.92]Okay.
[156:28.94]Do not cross this line.
[156:32.28]If I cross that line...
[156:35.12]Before doing the rest of it, right?
[156:36.54]I'm going to do it right here.
[156:37.64]Let's try it.
[156:41.91]See?
[156:42.75]In here.
[156:43.81]If I start going over that line, and I'm like, let me tell you a story.
[156:48.33]I'm in trouble.
[157:00.26]Quadrant by quadrant.
[157:01.68]Nothing else.
[157:17.78]I'm good!
[157:27.65]I'm not over the line.
[157:29.03]The line is right at the edge of this wall.
[157:36.34]I'm going to leave a little bit of dirt so I can see where the line is still.
[157:53.03]Okay.
[157:53.85]That's alright right now.
[157:55.25]Let's get this edge over here.
[158:00.31]And as fast as you can say, Bob's your uncle.
[158:06.93]Bobby's your aunt.
[158:09.77]I have a delicious virgin strawberry.
[158:13.27]Daiquiri.
[158:13.89]Alright, this one's good.
[158:25.50]Now we're gonna go in the corner.
[158:36.08]Perfect.
[158:40.66]-2.
[158:41.26]Stop immediately.
[158:43.76]No, I don't think I will.
[158:44.84]Actually, yeah, I will.
[158:49.66]I'm sorry.
[158:50.16]I'm so sorry.
[159:03.33]Don't miss anything, just go slow.
[159:06.01]If you take your time, you don't have to spend more time added on top, going back and doing this again.
[159:15.09]If you spend the extra time to make sure it's done now, you don't have to come back and do it again.
[159:21.35]Efficiency.
[159:40.58]Don't steal that joke.
[159:41.34]There's a bunch of... Hold on.
[159:42.08]There's a shitload of people here that don't know me, really.
[159:44.98]Hey, do you guys know?
[159:47.22]Don't steal that joke.
[159:47.91]I'm gonna do it.
[159:49.09]Did you guys know that every day, you eat over an inch of dirt every meal?
[159:55.83]Every single day.
[159:56.45]Isn't that insane?
[159:58.39]Did you know that?
[160:01.85]You eat over an inch of dirt every single day.
[160:05.14]It's crazy.
[160:05.86]Isn't that, like, kind of gross?
[160:08.20]That's a weird statistic, don't you think?
[160:15.84]Speak for yourself.
[160:16.54]No, everybody does.
[160:17.31]We all do.
[160:17.87]Every single person eats over an inch of dirt a day.
[160:25.22]I mean, you gotta be sitting at a table.
[160:28.14]You gotta be at least a few inches off the ground eating that food, don't you?
[160:57.37]What's the joke?
[160:58.03]That is the joke.
[160:58.81]Are we not listening?
[161:23.40]I don't get it.
[161:24.70]I'm not outside the line!
[161:26.14]This is- Look!
[161:26.94]The line's right there!
[161:28.00]Ya clown!
[161:30.75]The line's right here!
[161:31.59]See?
[161:48.99]Somebody wrote in all caps, what are you talking about?
[161:53.18]I don't know how it was.
[161:54.28]Is it really this hard to follow this conversation?
[162:01.08]Sometimes I feel like you guys act like you're changing channels.
[162:06.87]Like... And then when it's... Here we are, we get...
[162:25.73]Alright, I'm focusing on this railing and I'm going to make sure it's done well.
[162:50.38]Play with the ball.
[162:51.82]I can't leave.
[162:52.71]I can't cross that.
[162:54.68]I cannot cross that line.
[162:57.70]Not until everything here is clean.
[163:12.33]Can't do it.
[163:15.63]Do I turn the music up?
[163:17.27]Turn the music up?
[163:18.09]I'll turn everything up.
[163:21.20]That goes up a little.
[163:22.72]And the wash sounds will go up a little too.
[163:29.69]Little love.
[163:35.38]No.
[163:35.60]Little love.
[163:39.57]That's fine.
[163:59.20]You need to do a monkey impression?
[164:01.58]Why?
[164:01.78]For what?
[164:04.52]Alright, this railing's almost done.
[164:32.74]Am I going to get dinged for the reeling?
[164:34.58]Or is this not a ding?
[164:35.90]Is this not a dingable object?
[164:45.63]There it is.
[164:46.07]Okay.
[164:47.09]Don't leave the line.
[164:49.79]Do it because you love us.
[164:52.96]Where did you get that idea?
[164:55.94]Hmm?
[165:06.74]Is it still in the line?
[165:07.76]The line ends over there.
[165:10.44]I'm not going to do a monkey sound.
[165:11.62]Oh, okay.
[165:12.54]I hear it.
[165:12.80]You're hearing it.
[165:14.70]That looks good up there so far.
[165:36.95]Alright, that's good.
[165:37.65]Now I'm just going to do the stairs, and that should take this whole wall down.
[165:49.88]By the way, PowerWash Simulator is currently in 1.0.
[165:54.18]Just released into 1.0 today.
[165:58.28]After a while in early access.
[166:01.35]It's available for you to download right now.
[166:03.73]Free to go get it on various platforms.
[166:07.09]Strip Today is sponsored, of course.
[166:25.96]We laugh at all your dumb jokes, but you won't even do a monkey sound.
[166:29.25]Don't you think that is a dumb joke?
[166:33.29]If I were to just start doing a chimpanzee sound effect, that's dumb.
[166:40.68]Why would I be doing that?
[166:42.60]What's my motivation?
[166:43.38]Direct me.
[166:48.79]What's the motivation?
[166:55.33]Not bad.
[167:05.66]Because you've done it before.
[167:11.08]I love this halfpipe.
[167:19.99]I love the watermelon.
[167:32.68]Dude, if I owned this park, there would be a watermelon-scented plug-in or something, or watermelon-scented spray that we sprayed all around the place and then opened the park.
[167:49.78]People would come over here and be like, What?
[167:52.15]Oh my, dude, it's watermelons!
[167:53.99]It'd be awesome.
[168:02.90]I gotta slow it down.
[168:12.77]This song is good.
[168:14.91]Who recommended this?
[168:15.87]Because it's actually fantastic.
[168:25.08]Should I play the Flintstones SNES game?
[168:36.78]Sure It's probably gonna ding here in a minute
[168:56.80]Ooh, that was a good line.
[169:01.28]Come on, let's see a ding.
[169:23.36]Ding.
[169:24.74]Ding.
[169:32.28]Let's see it ding.
[169:45.41]Is mold on the wall?
[169:48.03]Yeah, I know, but I'm doing the pool.
[169:49.63]Whatever this thing is.
[169:59.44]Yes.
[169:59.98]Alright.
[170:00.58]That's done.
[170:02.76]This wall over here now.
[170:03.50]Alright, we just stay in the... Don't freak out.
[170:08.45]I think I can go wider here.
[170:09.51]Yeah.
[170:11.11]Here it is.
[170:11.51]Yeah, it's the Flintstones SNES soundtrack.
[170:45.79]No monkey, no buy.
[170:52.49]So what, you're implying that if I do a monkey sound, you will buy this game?
[170:59.50]Power Watch Simulator.
[171:01.56]Available on Xbox S. Xbox X. Steam.
[171:08.91]Game Pass.
[171:10.57]So... That's what you're saying?
[171:13.25]Liars.
[171:31.95]You should be getting the game because it's a quality, fun game with really, really... Don't look at my lips.
[171:36.58]I just spit out something weird.
[171:38.30]It was gross.
[171:38.68]It was disgusting, whatever that was.
[171:40.94]You should be buying this game because it's a fun, relaxing simulator of washing stuff.
[171:45.74]That's what you should be doing.
[171:49.76]It was a piece of spaghetti?
[171:55.40]How would you have spaghetti stuck in your teeth?
[171:58.74]That's not... It's pasta.
[172:00.46]It's impossible.
[172:02.76]You don't have spaghetti stuck in your teeth.
[172:05.80]That will disintegrate over time.
[172:08.02]Not like a piece of broccoli.
[172:23.73]That's that whole wall, I think.
[172:29.03]Oh, the tops.
[172:29.99]The tops of this, right?
[172:30.80]Yep.
[172:52.15]I don't think we have to be perfect with this we'll get the ding.
[172:55.27]Shit.
[173:18.22]Imagine you saw this in real life.
[173:21.19]Is somebody power washing a park?
[173:26.75]I don't think that's that abnormal.
[173:41.98]Anything else on this?
[173:45.50]Yeah, here.
[173:47.58]What is this?
[173:48.22]I just made shrimp grits in your honor.
[173:54.91]I mean, hopefully it's good.
[173:56.53]I don't really like shrimp that much and I don't really like grits.
[174:00.11]But, I hope it's good.
[174:02.43]I know a lot of people like it.
[174:14.01]Ungrateful, he made it for you.
[174:16.21]I'm not eating it.
[174:17.07]I have nothing to do with this.
[174:33.26]Ungrateful.
[174:40.79]Alright, our strategy is working pretty well.
[174:45.60]Look at that.
[174:47.08]We're almost a tenth of the way there.
[174:56.96]I just said I'm sure it's good.
[175:02.14]You could be the most talented pizza crafter in the world.
[175:06.16]If somebody doesn't like pizza, they're not gonna really want to eat pizza.
[175:15.18]That doesn't mean that you don't have a very delicious dish in front of you.
[175:18.93]You really might.
[175:19.47]I'm sure it's good.
[175:45.27]What's that term?
[175:45.75]Like, bad pizza is still good pizza?
[175:48.97]No, it isn't.
[175:52.81]No, it's not.
[175:56.80]Bad pizza is gross.
[176:06.70]Hey, man, bad pizza... Bad pizza... What's the thing?
[176:09.23]Hey, bad pizza is like sex.
[176:14.98]It's still sex, right?
[176:17.00]And then they take the grease and they put droplets of grease in their eyes.
[176:29.14]I mean, how in the heck do you make a slope out of concrete?
[176:31.36]I don't know.
[176:32.16]You shape it.
[176:45.19]I actually eat junky pizza all the time.
[176:47.75]I actually love shitty pizza, so please do not take this joke as reality.
[177:02.75]But still though, sometimes you get a pizza that sucks so bad.
[177:05.66]And everyone's just like, well, who cares?
[177:09.90]I mean, it was still $18.
[177:34.87]Who pays $18 for pizza?
[177:39.42]Large pizzas are usually more than $15.
[177:47.88]I get a large pizza.
[177:49.94]I don't get a small.
[177:50.78]$18 for... Yeah, what do you mean?
[178:04.51]$18 is... That's pretty normal.
[178:10.17]Did I cross the line?
[178:11.17]No.
[178:17.41]Alright, are we good here?
[178:18.79]Take a look at that.
[178:19.35]It's almost perfect.
[178:26.88]Chatty's not eating it alone.
[178:28.24]I mean, I've seen people crush a large pizza before, and I'm just like, holy shit.
[178:39.34]Dude, I...
[178:41.79]Let's be real.
[178:43.47]I'm telling you right now, I have absolutely gotten really damn close to eating an entire large cheese pizza by myself.
[178:52.33]And I could have done it.
[178:53.63]But there's two more slices left in the box and you look at it and you just kind of go, that would be bad.
[178:59.58]That already is bad, right?
[179:03.26]That's already bad.
[179:05.48]If there's two or three slices left in the box and you're the only one eating it,
[179:10.84]Let's box it up and put it in the fridge.
[179:16.00]Right?
[179:16.48]Like... Somebody said he's talking about sex on a sponsored stream.
[179:22.86]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[179:25.03]The sponsor was only for a little bit.
[179:28.19]I'm just still playing the game.
[179:29.75]I want to support the game.
[179:31.47]I think it's a great game.
[179:34.89]The sponsor segment has ended.
[179:38.87]We're just playing PowerWash Simulator because I think it's a great game.
[179:42.70]Which, by the way... Where can you get it?
[179:46.48]I'd like to see it in the chat, please.
[179:54.84]Where's my... There it is.
[180:04.27]I didn't even talk.
[180:05.43]I made one small offhanded comment.
[180:09.82]about people's opinions on pizza.
[180:12.14]I didn't talk about... whatever.
[180:27.11]Alright.
[180:28.25]We are good.
[180:29.25]It's time to make a new line.
[180:32.87]You ready?
[180:36.07]Let's just make it easy.
[180:41.83]to the bench.
[180:42.25]Like, right here.
[180:46.23]Don't cross that line.
[180:57.41]Probably should just switch to the... Um... I don't have any more soap.
[181:10.06]We'll do a first pass.
[181:14.72]You sound like the radio guy from PT.
[181:18.99]Hello?
[181:19.47]Hello?
[181:19.73]Hello?
[181:43.80]Alright, let's pass number one.
[181:44.82]Alright, I need the stronger nozzle here.
[181:52.73]I'll go over it again.
[181:53.85]That's the phone guy.
[182:02.92]You should have -2'd that.
[182:04.06]You had an opportunity.
[182:09.15]All of you that just weren't sure if you should have hit -2, you should have.
[182:14.01]I'm telling you, you should have done that.
[182:18.79]And now it's too late, because now you look like you're doing it because I said it.
[182:37.45]This is on there.
[182:38.07]Ooh, family.
[182:41.63]From the town of Benrock, they're the modern Stone Age family.
[182:48.24]When... Hey, Fred.
[182:53.56]Buddy!
[182:54.06]When you meet the Flintstones... And have a due time...
[183:13.28]Wilma!
[183:14.25]I'm just kidding.
[183:47.28]This sound effect.
[183:49.26]The Super Nintendo Wind sound effect that was in everything.
[183:56.12]This sound is so scary.
[183:57.88]It's such a strange thing.
[184:01.66]It always gives me some kind of... It makes me feel a certain way.
[184:11.12]This was in Undertale?
[184:12.14]Yeah.
[184:14.50]What's wrong with you, seriously?
[184:16.08]Oh, yeah, I get that question a lot, but I don't even know what that... What do you mean?
[184:21.17]I'm just sitting here and just talking nonsense, just hanging out?
[184:25.68]Some of you guys act like I eat bugs after the stream's over.
[184:28.72]I just kind of hang out.
[184:30.86]I do my thing.
[184:36.50]Like, for some reason, I think a lot of you guys think I do.
[184:38.08]Oh, yeah.
[184:38.40]Oh, here it is.
[184:39.14]My dinner.
[184:39.70]Oh, the whole plate of cockroaches.
[184:41.46]That doesn't happen.
[184:42.20]I'm just a regular guy.
[184:43.40]I'm just a normal person.
[185:09.82]Yeah, hey, I get high and watch the same TV shows you do.
[185:12.28]No, dude, I think he eats bugs.
[185:35.59]No, I don't.
[185:36.39]In fact, I'm one of those people that, you know the, oh, look, it's the bug in the popsicle novelty item.
[185:47.63]I would never eat that.
[185:49.45]I don't want that.
[185:50.13]I would never eat one of those.
[185:52.22]People always point to a tweet that I made in like 2013, where I made a joke tweet about eating a bug.
[185:59.30]I mean, I swallowed a bug and it was like, okay, that was weird.
[186:01.82]I should tweet about it.
[186:03.30]And I'm like, oh, it's the greatest thing I've ever tasted.
[186:05.36]What do I do about this?
[186:06.25]It was clearly a joke tweet from like 2012.
[186:09.65]And people pointed that and they're like, wow, he's fucking crazy.
[186:29.05]But you know what I'm talking about?
[186:31.05]They're in the kind of golden, almost like Amber.
[186:33.91]I wouldn't eat one of those.
[186:37.28]There's usually a worm in it.
[186:40.20]Or sometimes just some kind of other scary bug in it.
[186:43.47]No.
[186:43.63]No.
[186:54.99]No.
[186:56.21]Just give me the lollipop.
[186:57.37]Why does it have to be a bug inside of it?
[187:00.12]Right?
[187:03.86]That golden kind of Amber lollipop.
[187:08.70]Can I just have that?
[187:09.94]I don't want the bug inside of it.
[187:19.81]Because I feel like that actually tastes good.
[187:22.35]Whatever that is.
[187:24.52]But I don't want the gross bug residue on it.
[187:34.02]Stop eating valuable rocks.
[187:45.59]Those are not lollipops.
[187:51.33]I find these ancient stones in the ground.
[187:53.74]I don't understand why people eat these.
[187:55.92]I don't get it.
[188:00.48]No, dude, that's a million-year-old fossil.
[188:03.08]Don't put that in your mouth.
[188:06.94]It tastes really sweet.
[188:26.27]There we go.
[188:32.76]Did the bug taste good, though?
[188:35.64]No, it was a...
[188:58.27]You're the only person that makes me laugh out loud.
[189:02.62]That actually makes me happy.
[189:05.14]I'm dead serious.
[189:05.94]Gotta laugh sometimes, right?
[189:36.89]Will you eat bugs for the fans?
[189:38.57]No.
[189:41.70]No.
[189:53.03]I gotta get up on top of the railing.
[189:55.67]Would you eat a bug for the haters?
[189:57.57]No.
[189:58.69]I'm not eating any bugs.
[190:02.23]Then that's where that conversation ends.
[190:04.15]I'm not gonna eat bugs for the haters.
[190:06.41]Bugs for the fans.
[190:08.77]I'm not eating bugs.
[190:09.87]I wouldn't eat bugs if my... If, like, my mother asked me to.
[190:16.56]Talk about my biggest fan.
[190:17.56]Mm-mm.
[190:31.88]Eat bugs for mom.
[190:33.62]I'm not eating, nobody, I'm not, I wouldn't eat bugs for anybody.
[190:44.33]What about a doctor?
[190:45.29]I would feel like I was getting pranked.
[190:52.11]I, what do you mean?
[190:57.18]But the doctor comes into the office and he's like, oh, Jeremy, okay, you have a headache.
[191:01.64]And it's time I can cure that for you.
[191:04.89]You have to eat four cockroaches in front of me.
[191:07.27]While I hold up a fucking cell phone.
[191:11.19]With TikTok open.
[191:13.39]What do you mean by that?
[191:15.22]Is there actual scientific evidence that this works?
[191:32.68]Okay, if it was true, and there was a data, a trial, or a study, and it was passed, you know, whatever, like, whatever, whatever FDA, whatever, it doesn't matter.
[191:43.36]If this actually worked, and it was for a thing that I wanted to get, like, cured, get rid of, or something.
[191:48.91]Dude, you know, that, like, chest and back problem I've had for, like, four years...
[191:54.14]If the doctor came in and was like, Jeremy, uh, you know, that kind of, like, center chest, like, pain that's really kind of fucking up your life the last four years, uh, if you eat this whole bowl of cockroaches, it'll go away.
[192:07.10]And he said, here's the study.
[192:10.72]That bowl will be gone in 15 seconds.
[192:17.30]So I guess, I guess there is, I guess there is a place where I would do it.
[192:27.76]But no, if he just kind of came in and was like, oh, hey, I'm a doctor.
[192:31.22]Eat bugs.
[192:36.77]He just opens the door.
[192:38.19]Hey, I'm a doctor.
[192:39.21]Eat these bugs.
[192:39.99]And puts them down and closes the door.
[192:41.33]I'm not going to do that.
[192:50.85]I wouldn't do that.
[192:53.04]What if he ate them in front of you first?
[192:54.84]I don't care.
[192:55.46]That's the best of whatever weird shit he's doing.
[192:58.92]I have nothing to do with that.
[193:02.98]So he comes in the room and he's just like, okay, so we took a look at your blood work.
[193:07.53]He's just eating them out of his pocket.
[193:11.50]Your HDL cholesterol is a little high.
[193:15.34]Your LDL is okay, but you're not... And then he goes like this?
[193:19.89]After talking about my blood results?
[193:21.27]I don't know.
[193:25.99]What does the doctor look like?
[193:29.35]Is he like six feet tall?
[193:32.75]Like 200?
[193:33.81]Lean cut?
[193:35.03]What does he look like?
[193:39.76]Does he have completely blemish-free skin?
[193:53.97]Does he have flowing hair?
[193:57.19]And he comes up with his license, and he's like, look, 60.
[194:01.42]60.
[194:02.26]And he looks fucking amazing?
[194:04.46]I don't know.
[194:04.92]Maybe I'd have to think about it.
[194:15.49]Alright, that's done.
[194:16.81]Alright, plan worked.
[194:23.24]Dude, why do you only listen to handsome doctors?
[194:26.90]No, I didn't say handsome.
[194:29.36]When did I say handsome?
[194:30.44]I said he was, like, cut up, jacked, healthy, blemish-free, flowing hair.
[194:37.55]He looks like he's... and he moves in a full stride.
[194:41.21]You know what I mean?
[194:42.23]I never said, wow, look at how handsome this doctor is.
[194:45.50]How healthy does he look?
[195:45.60]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[195:48.92]Okay, so fine.

[198:13.72]And he's still got the helmet on.
[198:28.25]It's a big, manly bike.
[198:39.67]He takes the bike helmet off and his hair is flowing.
[198:54.95]Alright, this looks good.
[198:57.45]I need a new line.
[199:00.99]A real man-sized bike.
[199:02.65]Alright, new line is right here.
[199:10.68]Don't cross that.
[199:16.52]Hey, you wanna eat some bugs, man?
[199:41.82]Would you eat the bugs in Jerma's fantasy scenario?
[199:46.73]I doubt it.
[199:47.79]I doubt... Yeah, no way.
[199:49.69]It's going to be mostly nos.
[199:55.35]Don't... This is not... Don't call it my fantasy scenario.
[200:09.51]This fucking music...
[200:25.62]What is playing right now?
[200:27.12]Why is this playing?
[200:34.78]Why are we getting this fucking romance music?
[200:51.81]Just got done with a quick bike ride.
[200:55.01]Kickstand.
[200:56.31]Comes in.
[200:57.45]Just like sweat just glistening off his forehead.
[201:01.59]So, what brings you in today?
[201:05.21]Well, I have a little bit of a headache.
[201:09.68]It's kind of like a migraine-esque kind of deal I got going on here.
[201:14.30]One second.
[201:15.83]Takes the bike helmet off and just hair.
[201:18.58]It's like at least 16 to 20 inches of hair.
[201:22.60]It pulls up the license.
[201:24.56]60, by the way.
[201:32.28]And I'm like, oh, wow, look at that.
[201:34.64]Wow, you got a lot of hair.
[201:35.82]Yeah.
[201:38.00]Haven't had a headache, by the way, in a long time.
[201:45.07]Different music.
[201:50.01]You want to eat some bugs?
[202:02.73]The music changed and changed everything.
[202:04.63]Is this bug music now?
[202:15.07]Why is this music perfect for all of this going on?
[202:19.09]What the fuck is happening?
[202:26.18]Why?
[202:26.64]This is... Forget it, forget it.
[202:36.36]What even sound... This auto-played.
[202:39.96]Water World?
[202:40.80]For Super Nintendo.
[202:42.43]Just started auto-playing after Flintstones.
[202:44.77]I went five and a half minutes into this.
[202:49.11]Stop!
[202:49.49]No, stop it!
[202:51.35]I'm getting on cam.
[202:54.28]I'm getting out of here.
[202:55.20]I'm back.
[203:08.77]I'm gone.
[203:14.91]Okay.
[203:23.97]I'm back.
[203:36.63]This music.
[203:37.33]Alright.
[203:37.71]What's this one?
[203:41.63]What?
[203:41.93]Solstice?
[203:43.49]Title screen theme?
[203:59.37]I did not expect that.
[204:29.90]Holy shit, this is good.
[204:35.18]Who put this in there?
[204:37.56]Who put this in the chat?
[204:39.48]Is this VRJosh?
[204:42.16]This is lightning good.
[205:08.46]Dude, this is lightning good.
[205:10.96]This is called Solstice Music?
[205:16.76]Title screen theme?
[205:22.95]Like Tim Fallon.
[205:25.27]Holy shit, this is crazy.
[205:28.91]Tim Fallon also did Pluck.
[205:31.03]Oh, alright, that makes sense.
[205:40.01]Was that new line?
[205:40.74]Yeah, here.
[205:41.18]Okay.
[205:42.76]Silver Surfer?
[205:43.78]Shit.
[205:44.08]Alright.
[205:44.74]That's awesome.
[205:57.37]The game was absolute blast.
[205:59.81]No, the game was ass.
[206:01.55]Let me read that correct.
[206:03.27]The game was absolute ass, but the music slapped.
[206:05.83]Okay.
[206:41.99]That was insane.
[206:48.02]Can somebody take ad out of the title?
[206:52.16]Because we're technically not... This is not an ad anymore.
[207:10.44]Mm mm mm mm mm.
[207:13.00]I can't even say that word.
[207:43.50]You know what's wild to think about this kind of stuff?
[207:50.04]With the tools that are available now, I wonder what some of these guys could have come up with.
[207:56.45]Right?
[207:57.33]Some of them are probably still in the industry, right?
[208:02.80]But this is what they had to work with back then.
[208:05.06]And listen to this.
[208:14.90]people still do it?
[208:16.34]Oh, yeah, but I'm just talking about back a long time ago, when you couldn't do anything else but this.
[208:21.80]I wonder if whatever tools they had, if you gave them even more tools.
[208:30.17]Normal music existed.
[208:38.02]But I'm talking about...
[208:41.72]You got me.
[208:43.02]You got me.
[208:43.82]Because that was dumb.
[208:53.31]I worded that wrong, though.
[208:58.37]Like, if they could have done this with an actual orchestra, and it could have gone on a CD or something, right?
[209:07.69]If they had the tools now, back then.
[209:12.58]to put it onto the cartridge.
[209:17.42]Orchestras existed.
[209:18.44]I'm not, I'm saying, look, I'm saying that if they could put more data on a disk, what would they have done with the data?
[209:32.87]What would Silver Surfer theme song have sounded like?
[209:43.54]Would he have changed anything?
[209:48.77]Does this dude die on bug juices?
[210:07.66]He did the music for Echo the Dolphin?
[210:14.08]That was sick.
[210:15.30]Let's do another one.
[210:16.58]Echo the dolphin.
[210:17.26]Okay.
[210:43.22]Did he do Echo the Dolphin?
[210:46.00]Oh, that's all Tim Fallon.
[210:47.68]Okay.
[210:48.74]The playlist from earlier.
[210:49.56]I held the Wilma way longer than that.
[211:17.18]So this is the whole playlist?
[211:23.49]What is this?
[211:24.19]Oh, that's not it.
[211:26.73]Okay, so what's the next in the playlist?
[211:37.15]This is the whole Tinfoam playlist.
[211:38.63]Let's go.
[211:39.01]There we go.
[211:45.12]Alright, that's good.
[211:45.56]That's a good volume.
[211:51.20]Alright, let's go.
[211:55.36]Put on Plock?
[211:56.58]I've listened to Plock a shitload of times.
[212:07.19]Did... Did this guy do the original NES Ninja Turtles?
[212:11.42]The dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun...
[212:20.74]No?
[212:20.92]Okay.
[212:23.10]Kinda sounds like it could be similar.
[212:29.04]Somebody said yes.
[212:29.78]You're the only person that said yes, why?
[212:48.56]So if you're wondering how much content was in this game, I've played this two different times now.
[212:53.63]Galaga?
[212:56.37]Uh, I played it for like six or seven, five or six hours before.
[212:59.31]About three or four hours now.
[213:00.90]There's at least, there's a lot of content in the game.
[213:06.64]There's a lot of just to do just to chill and play.
[213:09.46]You already know that.
[213:11.86]But what you don't know is that it could be on the Xbox One.
[213:16.28]Xbox, wait, that might be wrong.
[213:18.04]Well, it's alright, the ad's gone now.
[213:19.62]I'm not doing an ad anymore, so.
[213:22.28]It could be on that.
[213:41.79]Can I get this with this one here?
[213:43.69]Yeah.
[214:03.18]The command is still there?
[214:04.06]That's okay.
[214:05.00]It probably just shouldn't be in the title anymore.
[214:21.09]Do the boss theme for Plock?
[214:22.75]I'll put Plock on after this.
[214:32.00]Oh, that is still Adara.
[214:33.21]Hold on.
[214:33.51]I gotta go harder.
[214:51.96]I'm at 37% right now.
[215:25.96]Is it better with the sound off?
[215:37.32]You want the sound on?
[215:38.10]I feel like it's just kind of in the background.
[215:47.15]Keep the sound on.
[215:51.77]Sound off or sound on?
[215:56.04]RT game!
[215:57.12]RT game of the raid.
[215:59.12]What's up, RT?
[216:02.50]RT, you did this in real life.
[216:05.90]How was that experience?
[216:13.22]Yeah, thanks for the raid.
[216:13.88]Welcome.
[216:15.56]Playing Power Washer Simulator.
[216:19.12]If you guys don't know, RT did this in real life.
[216:22.18]He did a power washer stream where he power washed shit in real life.
[216:31.48]Hope you had a good stream.
[216:33.20]Welcome everybody.
[216:35.27]Always a pleasure to see RT.
[216:43.25]You're just doing work in a video game.
[216:46.44]Yeah, but man, we're listening to fucking chiptunes while we're at it.
[216:52.73]You can do that as well.
[216:56.71]Do I have to explain myself?
[216:58.75]The most time I have on stream in a video game is a game where you clean houses.
[217:03.76]I don't know.
[217:04.34]I like these games.
[217:05.32]I like this kind of stuff.
[217:07.62]I don't know.
[217:07.92]I just do.
[217:19.09]We heard this one already, but whatever.
[217:33.66]What do you want me to do?
[217:36.78]Don't explain yourself.
[217:37.46]You're going to make it worse.
[217:45.47]Alright, I'm all... This is looking good.
[217:47.77]This is actually looking pretty good.
[217:51.59]No, there's no raid song.
[217:52.71]Guys, we don't do raid songs.
[217:54.00]Alright, it's time to put my foot down.
[217:57.32]The raid song has not been a funny joke since 2018.
[218:02.74]I cease this.
[218:05.37]Cease this immediately.
[218:09.57]Cease this immediately.
[218:21.13]Ooh.
[218:22.67]Yuck.
[218:31.64]What the hell?
[218:32.10]Get up.
[218:33.68]Can I not stand up there?
[218:40.87]Can I not walk up here?
[218:41.87]It's alright.
[218:47.53]Maybe I can get the ding.
[218:49.55]From here...
[218:53.56]It's gonna be close.
[219:06.08]So many shit stains.
[219:08.24]That'd be weird if that was at a skate park.
[219:10.02]Shit.
[219:24.93]I got a help... heck of a filthy sidecar if you can fit us in.
[219:28.51]I can run it up to you if that helps.
[219:30.59]Wait, you'll deliver it here and I'll do it?
[219:31.69]Because one thing I know about concrete is that it likes to be as flat as possible.
[219:38.07]What's going on?
[219:50.94]Why is that blinking over there?
[220:06.41]Because that's the quest.
[220:07.29]I don't have to do that immediately, right?
[220:09.79]I can do it whenever I want.
[220:25.99]Now, now, hurry!
[220:27.01]Alright!
[220:48.42]Sorry, one guy.
[220:49.08]I'm doing it later.
[221:22.62]Alright, these rails!
[221:23.90]Come on.
[221:32.75]Good.
[221:34.71]Oh, the gate, too.
[221:35.47]There's, like, fence here.
[221:39.41]You know what sound that makes, too.
[221:41.69]It's like...
[221:46.23]I love that sound.
[221:46.98]That's like one of my favorite sounds is a power washer kind of hitting a grate like this.
[222:48.39]It's like a 10-hour version of this song
[223:01.37]This is looped four times?
[223:03.41]Has it?
[223:05.37]Oh, it's almost over.
[223:06.11]Okay.
[223:10.23]Oh, it's from the ladder.
[223:13.88]What's next?
[223:16.06]I don't know what this is, but it sounds good.
[223:40.09]Does this work?
[223:42.59]Oh, I can... That's not that high, though.
[223:44.03]Shouldn't it be a few more steps?
[223:46.19]You gonna fail the quest?
[223:47.03]I'm fine.
[224:04.61]Section is almost done.
[224:27.16]Beautiful.
[224:30.34]Beautiful!
[224:42.15]I'm not even halfway, holy shit.
[224:43.69]Alright, I'll be good.
[224:50.47]I'm- wait, what?
[224:51.81]No, I'm not there yet.
[224:53.99]I thought somebody said I hit a million followers.
[224:56.37]I was like, oh, wow.
[225:07.18]Almost there, yeah, almost.
[225:08.22]I'm gonna have to take a screenshot.
[225:11.54]Just play Among Us for 10 minutes and you'll do it.
[225:14.70]No, I want it to be natural.
[225:17.62]I want it to be natural.
[225:18.68]I don't want to just have it be like a let's go.
[225:28.00]How am I supposed to get up there?
[225:28.88]That's that.
[225:51.81]Unfollow.
[225:52.83]Don't do that.
[225:55.57]Okay, did I complete everything over here?
[226:00.15]Alright, we're going to take a break from that.
[226:01.57]Let's go to... We'll put on Pluck.
[226:05.39]Wait, Spider-Man and the X-Men?
[226:13.73]Really?
[226:16.57]I remember this.
[226:26.68]I didn't... Wow, this guy did everything.
[226:34.99]Yep.
[226:36.49]Alright.
[226:37.37]So now I can make a new line.
[226:38.57]New line is here.
[226:41.37]Let's say from here to here.
[226:44.82]From this, like, right here.
[226:49.56]Let's just go to the edge of here.
[226:50.84]Yeah.
[226:51.18]Alright, that's good.
[226:52.10]New line.
[226:52.45]Oh, you know what?
[226:54.07]Let's make it easy.
[227:01.81]There.
[227:01.99]Alright.
[227:03.19]New line.
[227:03.61]Let's go.
[227:09.23]You can still kind of hear this.
[227:15.89]What's next?
[227:20.38]Is this the same song?
[227:28.32]Guys.
[227:29.74]I got a better idea.
[227:35.83]I want to play the Maximum Carnage OST.
[227:51.18]This is a good one.
[227:52.06]Oh, you gotta guess my favorite song on this album.
[227:56.30]Put it louder.
[228:06.57]Alright, you gotta guess my favorite song on the album.
[228:09.51]It's not this one.
[228:29.54]I'll let you know when it comes on.
[229:02.15]That is the title theme, right?
[229:04.55]I believe it is.
[229:07.21]Maximum Carnage.
[229:34.35]I feel like I'm weird right now.
[229:35.51]I'm just sitting here going like, yeah!
[229:38.31]While I'm power washing a wall listening to Maximum Carnage.
[229:46.72]Yep, this one's good.
[229:56.09]Do you guys know that Venom is a good guy in this game?
[230:00.01]Did you know that Venom is a good character and he's a good guy and he's an anti-hero?
[230:06.05]Don't ever say that Venom's a bad guy.
[230:07.21]He's not bad.
[230:07.69]He's an anti-hero.
[230:11.97]That's good.
[230:29.96]Morbius is that now.
[230:31.36]No, Morb... Never mind.
[230:40.05]Where's my stool?
[230:45.31]And... No, this one's good too, but it's not my favorite one.
[230:51.30]This one's actually pretty bangin'.
[231:23.33]Yep, Mod Chat's got it.
[231:25.25]Dr. Clay's got it.
[231:30.32]No spoilers, no leaking.
[231:39.88]Morbius is in this game?
[231:43.43]Wait, Morbius is in the game?
[231:45.21]As what?
[231:48.93]Is he one of the summons?
[231:55.72]I don't mean like, who does the actor Morbius play as?
[231:58.44]I'm saying, what does he do?
[232:00.34]Is he a boss or is he one of the summons?
[232:12.71]Because there's five or six summons.
[232:14.95]Can't you summon Captain America in that game?
[232:17.79]In Maximum Carnage?
[232:20.23]Yeah.
[232:20.67]No, you can summon Captain America.
[232:23.49]He comes out and throws a shield at somebody.
[232:25.57]So, he's a summon.
[232:28.69]Yeah, he is a summon.
[232:29.57]Alright.
[232:36.40]Who is he in the game?
[232:41.27]That's so stupid.
[232:42.31]Yeah, who does the actor Morbius play in Maximum Carnage for the Super Nintendo?
[232:48.63]Not this one.
[232:51.76]Where's that line?
[232:54.28]Wait, hold on.
[232:55.36]Oh.
[233:02.79]Some of you will get that.
[233:03.99]Some of you will.
[233:04.79]Some of you will... I will just unlock a fucking memory and you'll be like, holy shit, that's the... You unlocked an entire memory.
[233:16.32]I'm glad I just unlocked that memory for you.
[233:28.38]That's when you first hear this song and you first hear that noise.
[233:37.79]You just woke up sleeper agents.
[233:50.92]Come on, like I've never played video games before.
[234:03.86]By the way, I want to make sure you turn your volume down a little.
[234:06.34]When my favorite song comes on, it's going at maximum.
[234:08.48]As high as the volume can go on my OBS.
[234:13.49]That's not true.
[234:13.95]I won't do that to you.
[234:14.55]Alright, right to this lump here.
[234:24.85]This kind of sounds like the thing that Beavis and Butthead do.
[234:33.58]And they put their hands up.
[234:34.54]This is like a MIDI version of that.
[235:10.91]Oh, wow.
[235:22.57]Right here is... Like, Carnage always hit me with the axe arm.
[235:30.63]And it always just pissed me off.
[235:31.71]Right there.
[235:32.01]Right when the music stopped.
[236:07.03]Okay.
[236:09.33]Ladies and gentlemen, I think it's time that I turn this shit way the fuck up.
[236:17.23]It's getting there.
[236:22.06]We're getting close.
[236:27.34]One more Beavis and Butthead.
[236:30.40]And then after that, I think it's time to turn it up.
[236:51.05]Here it comes.
[236:51.95]It's definitely right here.
[236:58.50]Turn it up!
[237:18.65]If you guys don't know, this is a... This is literally just... The mob rules.
[237:23.72]It's a Black Sabbath song.
[237:46.31]Oh, the line!
[237:47.03]Oops!
[237:49.08]Alright, so hold on.
[238:11.10]Are you ready?
[238:15.41]I know DMCA, but still.
[238:17.01]So you hear that, right?
[238:20.33]You hear that one.
[238:21.75]Let's put a DMCA, whatever.
[238:25.60]This is an ad.
[238:29.26]Alright, you ready?
[238:29.78]So hear that.
[239:18.27]So now... It's literally the same exact song.
[239:35.60]It's the exact same song.
[239:40.26]Hey, this one's DMCA safe!
[239:45.93]Spider-Man wrote this one.
[239:47.23]This one, Black Sabbath, it had nothing to do with this.
[239:49.49]Spider-Man wrote and directed this song.
[240:03.79]No, it was Morbius.
[240:05.17]I'm sorry, you're right.
[240:25.44]Watch that line.
[240:26.39]Don't go across it.
[240:31.47]I wish I had more soap.
[241:00.66]An uncredited version of Black Sabbath's The Mob Rules appears in the soundtrack during the boss battles against the supervillains.
[241:10.19]So it was literally just ripped.
[241:19.05]That's so funny.
[241:26.48]Back to our regularly scheduled water noises for a little bit.
[241:30.35]I'll put Plock on in a minute.
[241:31.59]We gotta take a break.
[241:33.07]From, you know, those sounds to these sounds.
[241:39.23]I'll make a little rip bozo.
[241:40.67]What?
[241:44.91]Look at this place.
[241:50.78]I'm 55% of the way there.
[241:52.68]I'm pretty much done.
[242:03.04]Alright, what's... I know there's still some, but this should blink eventually.
[242:18.11]This streamer is wicked goofy.
[242:21.88]That person left, and then not coming back ever.
[242:37.01]And they'll probably always remember that time when it was like, hey, you should check out this guy, Jerma.
[242:40.21]He's funny.
[242:40.63]I like him.
[242:42.89]And he's like, I'm... Yeah, I mean, I went to his stream and I'm not a fan.
[242:50.60]This guy's so crazy.
[242:51.68]He's like such a... Wow, that was so weird what he did.
[242:54.00]He did like a goofy laugh to this guy.
[242:56.82]Am I aced?
[243:14.47]Did you hear this guy eats bugs?
[243:15.75]Do you remember what was funny today, Sag?
[243:27.26]That's not fair!
[243:38.64]Alright.
[243:39.70]Should I do the work order thing now?
[243:44.57]I need a new line.
[243:47.60]Uh... How is this only 57%?
[243:50.44]Here's the line.
[243:55.06]Right here.
[243:56.10]So, from, like, here... Okay, that's good.
[244:04.47]Um, yeah, whatever.
[244:05.21]That's fine.
[244:05.53]Let's get right in the middle here.
[244:12.13]There we go.
[244:19.64]first pass why will he not play tally hall what's tally hall tally hall what what is it why are people saying play tell what's the it's a band okay
[244:49.68]It's a great band.
[244:51.36]It's just... Why would I... It's just DMCA?
[244:59.88]They're good?
[245:14.62]They're good, but... Yeah.
[245:17.81]I mean...
[245:20.35]I might put some DMCA shit up here, but I am playing a whole album on stream.
[245:27.42]He's gonna get me in trouble.
[245:45.46]Alright, let's clean this up a little bit more.
[245:46.86]Where's the line?
[245:47.56]Right there.
[245:49.85]What is this?
[245:52.67]Oh, I didn't even go up there.
[245:53.47]Alright.
[246:03.81]So, I have a funny story about having to think of water and soap.
[246:09.04]So, my mother visited here at one time.
[246:10.82]This was, I don't know, let's say it was, I don't remember exactly, but it was like last year at some point.
[246:18.14]And my mother watches the channel sometimes.
[246:22.92]So she came over and she, you know, was making references to the streams and, hey, yeah, so, you know, like, look at me and stuff.
[246:31.57]And I'm like, oh my God, you watch, you actually watch the streams.
[246:35.50]So she started to like understand Twitch lingo and started to use Andy.
[246:43.00]And the reason why I'm saying this is because Holly was washing her hands.
[246:50.15]Like very, very lightly, right?
[246:53.37]So she's washing her hands and my mother comes over to her and goes, oh, wow, soap Andy.
[247:04.35]meant she had never said anything Andy before this she called Holly soap Andy because Holly used like a two pumps of soap and we just started cracking up we were like holy oh no
[247:41.24]We have converted her.
[247:46.80]So Andy.
[247:52.62]It was like, honest to God, it was probably one of the cutest, just most adorable things I've ever heard.
[247:59.03]It was just so funny.
[248:03.87]Like she had just learned the lingo.
[248:05.73]She's like, I got an opportunity to use it.
[248:08.31]I saw two or three pumps of soap there.
[248:11.53]Soap Andy.
[248:27.90]Has she been among us the whole time?
[248:29.52]I don't, kind of.
[248:34.30]So sometimes I will stream, and my mother will make a reference to the stream that I did a day or two ago.
[248:41.69]And I'm just sitting there going, there's no way she would know that unless she watched the whole thing.
[248:47.11]But then other times, I think she just kind of pops in randomly.
[248:53.31]I think like once every few months, she will watch a stream.
[248:58.33]But I will have conversations and she will say...
[249:01.49]You know, she'll say something like, there's no way you didn't watch a lot of the stream, right?
[249:04.69]So for instance, like today.
[249:07.65]If my mother would have, would have, would have get on the phone with me and be like, oh yeah, so Jeremy, I found this new product.
[249:12.24]It's called the, uh, the water grenades.
[249:15.26]I'd be like, you watched a lot of the stream today.
[249:20.03]Like you had to have.
[249:45.44]For the love of God, tell her to watch without chat.
[249:48.35]I don't think she even knows how to use chat.
[249:54.12]She just like puts on the video player.
[250:43.58]What did she think of Dollhouse?
[250:47.66]She liked it.
[250:51.81]If you don't understand the Twitch extension stuff, it's hard to follow a lot of that sometimes.
[250:57.41]But no, she gets it.
[250:58.83]She understood.
[250:59.73]She knew what was going on.
[251:26.18]Did you see you have Whoopi with death?
[251:28.86]I assume... I'm assuming yes.
[251:39.94]We don't talk about that very often.
[251:42.81]And I'm realizing that my mother does watch streams sometimes, so she just heard potentially a long conversation about me going to the doctor and eating bugs in a romantic relationship with the guy.
[251:52.43]So...
[252:11.07]She just hates everything I'm doing.
[252:12.82]That would be so funny.
[252:23.25]Really, really bad stream today.
[252:25.33]Really not happy with what you were saying.
[252:28.74]It wasn't funny.
[252:29.76]You know, I -2'd the most I've ever -2'd, being in your chat.
[252:35.04]I didn't raise you like that.
[252:36.90]I raised you to be, to have, plus twos, Jeremy.
[252:52.83]Holly said she, I missed the romantic doctor bit.
[252:55.49]What is that?
[253:03.02]Babe.
[253:04.16]Babe.
[253:17.84]Delete the VOD.
[253:29.35]No, it's Chad was acting crazy.
[253:34.02]Like usual.
[254:03.04]She's being informed.
[254:03.84]She's laughing over here.
[254:34.35]Yeah, I, okay.
[254:35.43]Yeah, I ate, I, I, chat said I ate bugs with a guy.
[254:39.27]That's it.
[254:42.03]Yeah, I don't know why I'm like, oh, don't worry.
[254:44.33]No, no.
[254:46.29]I literally ate bugs with a doctor and that's it.
[254:48.95]That's literally it.
[254:56.80]Somebody just wrote, it was hot.
[255:10.21]Honey, they're fucked up, okay?
[255:19.45]Did you read that?
[255:20.27]Did you see that?
[255:32.48]This is unfair.
[255:33.06]You came up with the meat of the story.
[255:38.55]She said, why did the doctor have sexy biker shorts on?
[255:42.97]Hold on, hold on a minute.
[255:44.31]Hold on just a second.
[255:45.73]Never in that story, never in that story did I say sexy biker shorts.
[255:51.84]Not one time.
[255:54.56]Pull back the VOD.
[255:55.86]I want all of you to pull the VOD back and not once did I say sexy biker shorts.
[256:00.16]I did not say, I said biker shorts.
[256:04.27]He was in biker shorts, not sexy biker shorts.
[256:09.22]I want to know where that's from, because it's not from me.
[256:15.22]It was verbatim.
[256:30.16]All biker shorts are sexy.
[256:33.85]Okay.
[256:42.95]No, he was biking.
[257:11.68]She said, okay, honey.
[257:13.72]Okay.
[257:14.58]See?
[257:14.94]There we go.
[257:15.30]Honey, we're good.
[257:16.66]We're good.
[257:18.52]Stop saying sexy biker shorts.
[257:27.29]You said he was a 60-year-old hot biker guy.
[257:40.49]The skin is falling off of my mouth.
[257:43.81]No, this is not a sponsored stream anymore.
[257:46.47]I genuinely think this is a fun game.
[257:48.81]This is not a sponsored segment anymore.
[257:57.22]The sponsored segment is well done with.
[258:00.16]This is just a very fun game, which...
[258:06.10]Oh, man!
[258:06.78]I just wish I knew where I could get it.
[258:07.96]Well, I can tell you.
[258:09.53]On the Xbox Game Pass store.
[258:11.61]You can get it.
[258:12.53]It's available right now for Steam.
[258:13.93]It's on Steam right now.
[258:14.83]It just came into 1.0.
[258:17.19]Just came into 1.0 on Steam.
[258:21.55]I forgot my line.
[258:41.90]Stop activating sleeper agents.
[258:49.07]It's got six co-op players.
[258:50.71]I feel like that's going to be insane.
[259:02.40]Why is everybody ResidentSleeper?
[259:24.35]That's just your mom in chat.
[259:27.47]God.
[259:28.95]Damn, that was a good one.
[259:31.59]That was seriously, holy, wow.
[259:36.87]That was a good one.
[259:39.24]What a good callback.
[259:44.32]That's a great callback.
[259:49.82]That was an absolute zinger.
[260:08.80]I can't believe I actually did the skate park.
[260:13.18]That's shocking to me.
[260:14.31]Isn't it shocking to you?
[260:52.30]Got it.
[261:05.93]Jerma sexy doctor sitting in a skate park.
[261:09.34]E-A-T-I-N-G bugs.
[261:48.48]I found that one adequately humorous.
[261:50.10]Me too.
[261:51.68]Why did you read that?
[261:53.08]Because it was funny.
[261:56.56]Are you questioning me reading messages in chat?
[261:58.53]I read a chat message that said I was going to shove a baseball up my ass.
[262:03.99]That's going to get you banned, right?
[262:09.65]But it doesn't mean I'm not going to read it and be shocked by it.
[262:21.10]I keep, that lives rent-free in my head.
[262:23.44]You have no idea.
[262:26.24]You guys have no idea.
[262:27.42]I said it yesterday, it's rent-free.
[262:30.67]Every day I think about somebody just typing out, oh, yeah, dude, let me help you out here.
[262:35.09]Oh, you're like a new viewer?
[262:35.95]Yeah, let me help you.
[262:36.47]He's going to shove a whole baseball up his ass.
[262:38.03]That's the baseball stream.
[262:39.65]There's so much, there's so many layers to why that's funny.
[262:43.53]So many.
[262:45.99]It's one of the funniest things I've ever heard, probably in chat, because there's so much going on there.
[262:52.69]This is a big stream event.
[262:54.46]I keep hyping it up, man, on the baseball stream, man, be ready.
[262:59.30]It's gonna be me putting a baseball in my ass?
[263:03.00]And I'm hyping it up for months and months and months and months in a, like, in a baseball field?
[263:13.48]Or even not, am I just here?
[263:16.55]That's what makes me laugh so much, is the baseball stream.
[263:19.63]Oh, he's gonna play baseball.
[263:20.97]No, it's me in this chair putting a baseball in my ass.
[263:27.16]You understand how much is going on here?
[263:30.80]And why would I hype that up so much?
[263:37.07]Why would I ever... But just so nonchalantly just replying to somebody with a very basic question.
[263:44.11]Dude, baseball stream.
[263:45.21]I wonder what that is.
[263:46.35]Oh, new viewer.
[263:49.57]Oh, replying to that person.
[263:51.41]Just being a motherfucker.
[263:53.56]Dude, he's going to shove.
[264:00.18]And it's not just baseball.
[264:02.72]It's whole baseball.
[264:05.81]It's whole baseball.
[264:08.08]He's going to shove a whole baseball up his ass.
[264:13.06]It's like, God damn it.
[264:24.05]So much goes into that, what I hear and see in my head.
[264:28.24]Hey guys!
[264:29.16]Hey!
[264:29.72]Oh yeah, welcome to the baseball stream!
[264:32.40]It's time!
[264:33.38]Get hype!
[264:33.88]It's the baseball stream!
[264:34.78]I've been talking about this for a long time!
[264:36.72]You know the stream where I shove a baseball up my ass!
[264:40.21]It's like, what the fuck?
[264:41.73]Why would... It's rent-free forever.
[264:51.51]I'll never get rid of it.
[264:52.31]It's always gonna be there.
[265:01.12]Because it's implied that I've been talking about it for months and everyone's like super excited about that.
[265:11.12]This is so funny.
[265:12.12]It's so funny.
[265:14.98]Maybe... Whoa!
[265:16.60]Cool.
[265:18.60]Maybe I am a childish and immature moron.
[265:23.68]But I'm sorry, that's funny.
[265:26.56]That's very fucking funny.
[265:41.29]You know?
[265:51.38]And that person's banned from the channel, right?
[265:55.14]Mods, like, please refresh my memory.

[268:30.58]What is that supposed to... Okay.
[268:36.64]Hey, by the way, I was a huge World of Warcraft fan, buddy.
[268:43.17]So let's relax for a sec.
[269:03.11]No, you're making it live rent-free in my brain again.
[269:05.27]I'm seeing the original messages.
[269:12.03]Dude, what the fuck?
[269:13.37]This guy should be banned.
[269:15.13]Like, permanently.
[269:18.99]Okay, how many times have they said this?
[269:21.31]How many times have they said this?
[269:23.27]Wait a minute.
[269:26.26]How many times have they said this?
[269:29.68]This is, hold on, the rabbit hole just got deeper.
[269:33.36]This is fucking unbelievable.
[269:34.84]Hold on.
[269:38.08]Give me one second.
[269:39.96]So here, this is the original comment that lives rent-free in my brain forever.
[269:43.59]It's the funniest fucking comment I've ever heard.
[269:48.61]So let's get this done right.
[269:51.51]Because this is a saga, apparently, that I did not know existed.
[270:00.08]What the fuck?
[270:13.72]I don't think I can show this on stream.
[270:16.72]I can't show that on stream.
[270:19.22]That's going to get me in trouble.
[270:21.02]Not just this guy.
[270:24.44]Okay.
[270:27.33]This is the original message.
[270:42.94]But it gets... This just kept going.
[270:47.88]I didn't even know this kept going.
[270:51.68]I can't show the rest of these, but he goes on.
[270:55.01]He goes on... Oh, my God.
[270:56.43]He goes on to say, how many baseballs do you think you'll be able to do?
[271:00.17]At Jerma985.
[271:01.85]What the fuck?
[271:04.15]How many do you think?
[271:05.91]It's hard to fit so many up there, don't you think?
[271:09.30]His... It's pretty gruesome.
[271:11.28]Okay, you know what?
[271:15.76]I bet he's gonna do vocal warm-ups.
[271:17.72]OMEGALUL.
[271:20.72]Plucking his ass hairs for the baseball stream.
[271:30.39]This guy's gonna get, this guy's gonna get snapped.
[271:32.39]This guy's getting Thanos snapped right now.
[271:35.39]This person, this person's just been out there.
[271:38.95]This person's been out there in the wild.
[271:58.10]But anyways... He's been banned!
[272:07.13]I did not know that Balfondler had that much of a track record.
[272:11.41]I did not know.
[272:11.97]I thought he had that one comment and then was talking about World of Warcraft.
[272:16.15]Oh my god.
[272:17.07]It's fucking funny.
[272:18.19]I don't even care.
[272:19.37]It just is.

[276:34.42]These outlaws.
[276:35.66]Oh.
[276:36.62]Well, don't let my white duds and pleasant demeanor fool you.
[276:40.64]I, too, have been known to violate the statutes of man, and not a few of the laws of the Almighty.
[276:45.86]You ain't no outlaw.
[276:48.46]And we don't drink with tin horns.
[276:51.78]Sir, it seems that you are no better a judge of human beings than you are a specimen of one.
[277:00.07]Yeah, whatever.
[277:08.48]Alright.
[277:09.52]Okay.
[277:23.54]Streaming is so fun.
[277:24.54]Can I just tell you?
[277:25.78]It's like, this is so fun.
[277:35.48]This is like, don't ResidentSleeper.
[277:38.01]Ban that person for six days.
[277:45.29]I don't even know what we're doing here, but we're doing something fun, right?
[277:49.64]I don't even understand what we're doing.
[277:51.32]But I'm having a great time.
[277:52.86]Is it weird?
[277:53.70]I don't understand.
[278:11.65]Should we ban the sleeper emote?
[278:13.19]Nah, nah, nah.
[278:14.39]Let him get it out of this system.
[278:16.55]Let him get it out of this system.
[278:36.46]Where's my stool?
[278:38.94]Alright, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[278:39.84]Wait, wait, wait.
[278:40.18]Back it up.
[278:55.21]But I know... Okay, the sponsor segment is over, right?
[278:58.21]But... I do want to say that... Thanks to PowerWash Simulator.
[279:06.06]Because this was a fun one.
[279:07.42]This is really fun.
[279:08.32]The game is really fun, too.
[279:11.40]Absolutely go get it.
[279:12.12]Support these guys.
[279:16.03]Oh, no.
[279:16.35]You're going to make me look like an idiot.
[279:18.29]Okay, don't ResidentSleeper for this part.
[279:19.65]Because if somebody clips this and was like, Hey, well, cool.
[279:21.97]He said something about the game.
[279:23.51]It's just going to be ResidentSleepers.
[279:24.45]But you guys love this game.
[279:25.63]I know you do.
[279:27.42]I'm certain you do.
[279:28.42]So let's make it look a little less grim in here, okay?
[279:50.43]How much more do I need?
[280:31.09]I'm gonna fall all the way back on my back.
[280:39.30]Oh, bro!
[280:40.16]Oh, Bell Pluck!
[280:41.04]Oh, Bell Pluck!
[280:41.68]Oh, Bell Pluck!
[280:50.67]Ow.
[280:51.59]Why is the volume so high?
[281:19.12]You can't resident sleep for this, can you?
[281:22.31]Fucking jokers.
[282:01.82]When is this thing done?
[282:05.91]There's nothing else here.
[282:06.91]Oh, it's a base here.
[282:10.95]I get it.
[282:11.56]It's the base.
[282:12.14]It's the base.
[282:49.38]Everyone's hype in the chat!
[283:02.19]Yeah, what these chatters don't understand is how would you be sleeping and typing at the same time?
[283:06.60]How is it possible that you can type ResidentSleeper and be asleep?
[283:09.78]It implies that you're sleeping at the stream.
[283:13.02]Yeah, we know they're here.
[283:39.26]I'm almost done!
[283:40.03]Just this little section and that's it.
[283:41.09]Something's in my eye.
[284:32.02]It looks so fucking stupid.
[284:34.64]I'm sitting here rocking out, having like a great time, and I look over, and it's just, it's only ResidentSleepers.
[284:40.89]Imagine just coming to the stream for the first time, you'd be like, wow, this chat hates this guy.
[284:45.69]They fucking hate this dude.
[284:48.29]They are not, they're not having any fun.
[284:51.13]What else you got?
[285:33.02]Clean lines.
[285:34.38]Clean lines.
[285:35.37]There it is.
[286:12.58]Alright mods.
[286:15.66]Let them out.
[286:16.85]Let's see what they say.
[286:17.71]Let them out.
[286:18.65]Let's see what they have to say.
[286:19.35]See what they have to say for themselves.

[286:38.92]Alright, yeah, I'll do it.
[286:39.58]I'll free him.

[286:49.02]Now shut up!
[287:12.78]I'm a sleeping resident, I'm a sleeping resident!
[287:18.89]After a riff like that?
[287:20.41]Get out of here, give me a break.
[287:41.66]When are you doing the power washing stream?
[287:45.51]You... best start believing that I'm playing it because you're in one.
[288:18.53]This just makes me want to just drink a pina colada.
[288:25.39]This part makes me want to be in first place in a Mario Kart race.
[288:37.26]It's almost done.
[288:53.05]92% that's right Taking everything up in one pass
[289:45.66]This one's really on there.
[290:15.91]Any more music?
[290:18.09]What else we got?
[290:21.05]Any more music to play?
[290:26.29]What's this one?
[290:30.05]Anybody in mod chat want to throw something in there?
[290:39.00]I'll take anything.
[290:40.06]Whatever.
[290:42.58]Ace Combat?
[290:44.24]Let's change it up.
[290:44.98]Sounds good.
[290:55.26]Ace Combat, zero.
[291:04.72]Alright.
[291:07.74]When's the baseball stream?
[291:08.92]August 19th.
[291:12.59]I'll get you a time as well, but not immediately.
[291:15.85]August 19th, in the afternoon.
[291:17.11]Sounds like Metal Gear.
[291:22.99]What is the baseball stream?
[291:26.04]Well, it's, uh, that's bait.
[291:28.73]Don't take it.
[291:29.19]You're gonna get banned.
[291:30.09]Don't take it.
[291:31.07]Don't take the bait.
[291:32.13]Don't take the bait.
[291:33.01]You're gonna get banned.
[291:33.85]Don't take the bait.
[291:35.30]Don't take the bait.
[291:36.10]You're gonna get banned.
[291:37.94]I'm just saying.
[291:39.48]Be careful.
[292:38.32]Damn, this is good.
[292:53.13]95 still?
[293:03.29]What did I miss besides this wall right here?
[293:14.62]This is the only wall, right?
[293:15.88]I think this is it.
[293:16.48]And maybe the tops?
[293:36.18]What just hit me?
[293:37.18]Something just smashed into me and threw me forward.
[293:39.20]I didn't do anything.
[294:09.28]97.
[294:09.34]It's going to be such a pain in the ass to find where this is.
[294:25.39]You might enjoy Death Stranding?
[294:27.67]No, I don't think so.
[294:29.87]here's why so somebody said dude you like these kind of tasks you're a big fan of just kind of like a menial task or whatever no see the issue is this game I can kind of pick up and jump in for four or five hours or so um not a hundred hours right I mean I can just play I can clean up the skate park
[294:53.06]I can be done.
[294:53.62]I can do this in a couple hours.
[294:55.78]But when the whole game is a menial task and it's like 100 hours long, I'm not into it.
[295:07.77]I wouldn't be able to get through Death Stranding.
[295:09.77]I know that it's a good game, but I just... After hour number 20 or 30, I'd be like, I don't want to do this anymore.
[295:18.08]I'd just be like...
[295:21.55]That's a bad take, jackass.
[295:26.21]I just said... Wait, why?
[295:28.00]I just said the game is probably a great game.
[295:31.56]But I don't have attention span for stuff like that.
[295:35.18]I don't have attention span for anything that's over 50 plus hours for a game.
[295:39.30]And you probably say, what about Elden Ring?
[295:41.07]That's a once in a lifetime video game.
[295:45.93]There will never be another Elden Ring.
[295:49.07]That is the Super Bowl of all video games at this point.
[295:51.61]Like, it's just... Come on.
[295:53.33]It's once in a generation.
[295:56.93]Sekiro didn't take me 100 hours.
[295:58.24]Sekiro was like 40.
[296:00.44]Dark Souls 3 was like 40.
[296:01.22]30, 45.
[296:02.08]Whatever it was.
[296:06.58]What about Red Dead?
[296:09.48]Red Dead wasn't 100 hours.
[296:10.28]Okay.
[296:15.70]Okay.
[296:17.98]Oh, that's what we're missing right here.
[296:22.32]Got it.
[296:24.38]This should be it too.
[296:32.99]Not quite.
[296:35.15]What am I missing?
[296:38.97]This place looks phenomenal.
[296:40.29]Is it just all the bullshit on the ground here?
[296:43.59]Is it all this crap?
[296:52.80]It's all this stuff.
[296:56.57]That's... Oh my god, it's everywhere.
[296:58.17]Alright, I have to just do some sweeps here.
[297:10.54]Damn it.
[297:23.11]I need the stronger nozzle.
[297:28.21]Come on.
[297:44.06]Did I already get this?
[297:49.44]No, I definitely didn't.
[297:51.38]There it is.
[297:51.92]Okay.
[298:01.16]He's still on this?
[298:02.30]Do you see how much was here?
[298:03.48]This is an entire skate park.
[298:13.67]And we had to pause for like 30 minutes to talk about... He who will not be named.
[298:36.18]Yeah, there's other game modes.
[298:37.92]I'll try the other game modes after this.
[298:40.00]I think there's a painting one.
[298:41.93]I'm curious.
[298:42.99]I want to try it.
[298:50.17]97%.
[298:50.23]Come on, Gwen.
[298:51.35]Really?
[298:54.13]Where is there another 3%?
[299:24.88]Top of the wall.

[299:28.50]Hold on.
[299:29.56]Yeah, I think you got it.
[299:31.40]Yeah, you nailed it.
[299:33.22]It's definitely the top of the wall.
[299:34.08]Alright, I need the ladder.
[299:41.36]Yeah, all that junk up there.
[299:43.95]Where's the ladder?

[314:40.55]You've got to be very detailed.
[314:41.49]I was just sweeping and running around.
[314:43.69]I should have blocked it off.
[314:52.10]This railing needs it too.

[315:02.24]Yeah.

[317:10.96]I played it while he was peeing.
[317:13.61]And we're like, no, no, we're not talking about the Harvest Moon game.
[317:26.80]Cloud Gaming.
[317:28.82]Is Harvest Moon Nintendo property?
[317:30.20]That's a good question.
[317:32.06]Is it third party?
[317:40.04]It's not.
[317:50.73]They should have gobbled them up a long time ago.
[318:04.21]I just did that.
[318:05.31]What?
[318:05.51]I'm not powerful enough?
[318:26.86]99% is driving me crazy!
[318:48.67]I just need- I want to see 100% so bad and it's driving me nuts.
[319:03.91]Stop rushing?
[319:04.63]I'm not.
[319:16.28]I wish I could play for you.
[319:17.36]I wouldn't have missed this.
[319:23.34]You can get it right now.
[319:31.27]You have an opportunity to pick this game up right now.
[319:37.08]You know.
[319:38.90]Whatever outlet you'd like to buy it on.
[319:40.84]It's on Game Pass.
[319:41.50]It's on Xbox S, Series S, X. It's on everything.
[319:47.74]Is it on PS5, PS4?
[319:51.38]Do I have any gray hairs?
[319:54.43]Nope.
[319:54.63]Alright.
[319:58.47]Wall, ramp, skate park floor.
[320:03.02]Dude, I wanna go in a helicopter and look down and see where this is.
[320:23.45]Where is it?
[320:39.06]Come on, the guy's not gonna... Whoever owns this place is not gonna walk around and examine every single piece of the ground.
[320:57.70]You know how you fix this?
[320:59.60]You call the guy and say, hey, by the way, the park is ready for you to come check and make sure it's clean.
[321:05.52]And the guy's gonna get in his car, grab a skateboard as the power wash person, put the skateboard down, and when the guy pulls up in whatever car, he comes up to check, start just doing kickflips.
[321:18.48]And skate around, kickflip, skate around.
[321:20.60]I have been testing it out.
[321:22.60]Well, it's nice and clean.
[321:25.04]And then having a couple of random marks makes complete and total sense.
[321:32.37]Make sure he can see you doing kickflip.
[321:34.89]Oh, I got a little scuff there.
[321:35.92]It's alright.
[321:37.22]Park's clean.
[321:37.72]I've been trying it out.
[321:46.90]Press tab?
[321:47.86]Dude, I'm pressing tab every five seconds.
[321:53.63]This one's already done.
[323:20.93]Where?
[323:27.48]Thank God.
[323:28.16]Okay.
[323:29.38]Which wall?
[323:36.52]Wall and ramp.
[323:41.27]Wall, wall, wall, wall, where?
[323:50.72]Where?
[323:55.80]What wall?
[323:57.86]Selected in the menu?
[324:02.04]Ramps, two out of three.
[324:06.09]Where?
[324:09.91]Baseballs are pushing up into his brain.
[324:48.64]It's so stupid.
[325:01.77]Get up!
[325:06.21]Hurt?
[325:06.63]It hurts.
[325:07.19]Play a new song?
[325:07.91]Fine!
[325:27.14]This is a good one.
[325:37.09]Holy shit!
[325:39.99]I was doing a dumb joke where I was pretending to be on a skateboard!
[326:06.36]This should not be happening.
[326:26.33]Kickflip, kickflip, grind.
[326:28.01]Kickflip, grind.
[326:38.43]Nice.
[326:39.17]All the way around.
[326:44.28]Let's watch.
[326:50.72]You can see me mark the line.
[326:55.66]Cool.
[327:08.22]That was pretty efficient.
[327:12.77]Alright.
[327:15.27]Okay, so.
[327:16.89]There's other game modes.
[327:18.03]Let's challenge mode.
[327:20.25]Wash against the clock.
[327:21.91]Free play.

[327:39.66]Am I on Mars?
[327:56.50]Cool.
[327:58.44]Is there any sound effects?
[328:18.28]I tried.
[328:18.56]Alright, Mars Rover, let's go.
[328:21.36]And do it.
[328:40.49]Hell yeah. 13%.
[328:58.67]Oh, it's really muddy.
[329:28.66]Is something walking around?
[329:37.91]Weird.
[329:57.30]I keep thinking it's a pterodactyl.
[329:59.70]Mars just looks like Jurassic period.
[330:21.62]The whole side?
[330:22.40]What?
[330:29.49]Jurassic, I said Jurassic period, not Jurassic Park.
[331:01.72]everything.
[331:02.10]What?
[331:03.92]I missed what you said.
[331:16.67]This is looking shiny.
[331:18.91]Nice and shiny.
[331:36.33]How are you cleaning everything and nothing at the same time?
[331:38.89]Oh, I see.
[331:39.43]I'm at 86%.
[331:51.62]I've been here for like two minutes.
[332:06.34]Alright, what's missing here?
[332:08.14]Turn it off.
[332:09.02]Shake the hand out.
[332:10.98]Stretch.
[332:11.84]Back.
[332:13.92]Your oxygen is at 21%.
[332:28.71]Get that toilet paper roll, whatever this is.
[332:32.63]This guy right here.
[332:44.01]What's missing?
[332:56.39]Footprints?
[333:09.35]Oh!
[333:28.50]Oh, so this is the... Oh, you would have had to come find it.
[333:31.46]Okay.
[333:35.16]Collect the hidden gnomes?
[333:36.06]I'm going to put them in the cockpit.
[333:55.41]Alright, what's left?
[333:56.09]What's going on here?
[334:02.74]Where are the hazard cameras?
[334:12.57]I guess I got it.
[334:30.58]Tire?
[334:33.27]Wheel hub and tire.
[334:34.57]Other side.
[334:54.34]Right there.
[335:07.11]How am I supposed to get it in there?
[335:15.35]I guess like that.
[335:21.06]And then hazard cameras.
[335:28.76]Where are the hazard cameras?
[335:29.64]Okay.
[335:44.58]It's blinking?
[335:45.86]It's glowing in the front.
[335:51.88]Yay!
[335:55.52]Should we go to the alien?
[336:04.83]Cool.
[336:10.85]Alright, what about challenge mode?
[336:12.89]Vehicles.
[336:15.16]Alright, how about the, uh, dirt bike challenge?
[336:20.45]One minute, thirty seconds.
[336:26.48]Three, two, one, go.
[336:45.54]There's probably people that are insane at this.
[337:20.56]Come on!
[337:34.87]Come on!
[337:49.77]What the fuck?
[337:55.64]What the fuck?

[341:12.72]Shit, I'm not gonna do it.
[341:13.64]Look at all this bird shit.
[342:22.82]Shit.
[342:30.70]It's over.
[342:30.98]I got close.

[342:51.47]I got close enough.
[342:55.39]93% that's an a on a test I'm so glad I got that that would have bothered me for the next like three days I Whatever if I conserved a little bit more I'll be fine, but whatever I don't care wait a minute this whoa whoa whoa whoa that was for gold I

[345:42.22]Just another mirror.
[345:44.65]And that's it.
