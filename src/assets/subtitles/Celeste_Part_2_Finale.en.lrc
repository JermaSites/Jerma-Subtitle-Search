[00:01.13]Hey guys, how are you?
[00:07.01]How's your Saturday afternoon going?
[00:11.37]Those of you on Pacific time right now, we are still on Saturday.
[00:17.89]I think it's, what is it, Wednesday for some of you guys?
[00:23.35]That PST is three days behind, so...
[00:28.91]Happy Tuesday or Wednesday, the further you go along the hemispheres here.
[00:40.76]Imagine being still on Saturday.
[00:45.06]It'd be really weird.
[00:45.76]Those of you guys that don't understand, if the world was much bigger, that would happen.
[00:55.11]If the Earth was ten times the size that it is, and you had two places that were... And then the sun still traveled across the globe, you know, the sun rotated around the Earth still, the way that it does.
[01:08.97]It would be Sunday when it was Tuesday for some people.
[01:21.70]That's not how it works.
[01:22.73]Have you ever looked in a microscope before?
[01:25.09]You don't know how that works.
[01:34.09]Anyways, we're gonna play Celeste.
[01:34.97]We're gonna finish it fairly close to the end, so... Might as well do it.
[01:40.12]Long stream.
[01:40.94]Because I think it's fun.
[01:47.22]But yeah, if the Earth was five times its size...
[01:51.19]Can you imagine if the Earth was ten times its size and the Sun was half its size?
[01:59.32]What the heck would happen there?
[02:05.22]We'd be dead.
[02:09.96]We wouldn't exist.
[02:11.68]Yes, we would.
[02:14.06]I would.
[02:16.47]I'd find a way.
[02:20.34]Thank you Tim Timmy for the $50 Hope you have a great stream Also, I made this Are you sure you did?
[02:31.72]Because there's a bunch of people that are gonna counteract your point here in about five seconds What did you make?
[02:40.00]This is called Jerma Slap This is Jermario Slap, okay
[02:58.91]That's pretty, that was pretty good.
[03:01.59]That was pretty good.
[03:04.11]Very, that was actually really good.
[03:06.43]Show us?
[03:08.11]Uh, I can't, how come I can't link it?
[03:10.47]I just, I just copy and pasted this, why can I not?
[03:13.59]What the hell?
[03:16.86]I just, I just had it open!
[03:24.56]There you go.
[03:26.30]Dramario slap.
[03:28.00]Thank you, Timmy.
[03:28.42]Thank you for the $50 too.
[03:30.34]Haven't even started yet.
[03:34.26]Just turned the stream on already.
[03:35.89]Somebody drops a $50 fucking bill here.
[03:38.55]5,000 bits.
[03:39.21]Thank you.
[03:42.69]And I don't think we need to waste very much time.
[03:45.41]Because we already know what we're doing.
[03:47.41]Where is Sheeto?
[03:49.36]Sheeto is sleeping over here.
[03:51.78]And... He's not to be awoken.
[03:56.24]He's very tired after last night.
[03:59.65]He was worked very hard.
[04:04.95]He sang his heart out for you guys, and now he needs a rest.
[04:11.26]Who is Shito?
[04:12.28]Oh, right.
[04:14.56]People that weren't here.
[04:17.38]I'll pick him up just very carefully.
[04:19.13]Make sure that... No, he's still sleeping.
[04:23.72]He's still asleep.
[04:25.52]Maybe show him for a minute.
[04:33.38]Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
[04:35.34]Don't wake him up.
[04:38.94]He likes to be held like this.
[04:42.92]This is Shito.
[04:46.92]You okay?
[04:53.29]Yeah, he's fine.
[04:55.91]Back to bed.
[05:00.18]I know my hair is fucking fucked up because I was in the wind.
[05:03.74]I know my hair looks like fucking al dente spaghetti today.
[05:07.05]And that's because I was out in the wind.
[05:09.57]I was in the wind.
[05:19.08]Alright, so let's go ahead and put Celeste on the screen.
[05:22.02]We're gonna finish it.
[05:23.54]We're very, very close to... Well, maybe not very close, but we're definitely close to the end of the game.
[05:34.99]Yeah, why don't we get it on there right now?
[05:36.63]Hey, look at that.
[05:38.83]Celeste.
[05:42.31]Your hair looks splendid today.
[05:44.33]Thank you.
[05:46.40]Hey, thanks!
[05:47.26]That's... I've never heard anybody say that before.
[05:50.98]Oh my... Holy crap!
[05:55.86]Alright, so here are your options today.
[05:57.02]We've got... Um... We can climb the mountain in Celeste.
[06:02.07]We can check out the credits.
[06:03.33]Or we can find out, once and for all, what the heck's in that cube.
[06:07.77]I think I'm looking forward to that, trying to figure that out.
[06:10.03]Wonder what Epic's gonna do here.
[06:20.37]doing the same, same joke from yesterday.
[06:25.06]Yeah, I'll get, okay, synopsis.
[06:27.18]Here's the synopsis of this whole thing, right?
[06:30.66]The story of Celeste is you gotta climb a mountain.
[06:33.50]And there are trials.
[06:38.00]You meet somebody along the way, they got stuck in a Fortnite cube.
[06:43.20]When are we gonna get that thing open, you know?
[06:46.01]Guy gets stuck in a cube, you gotta help him, you gotta break him up.
[06:49.01]You're being chased by a version of yourself.
[06:56.87]And now you get to the top of the mountain.
[07:04.40]Did you know it's impossible to outrun your own reflection?
[07:07.70]Well, it depends on if you're on the moon or not, because the moon's gravity is like 10% of Earth's, so.
[07:24.55]Celeste Part 2.
[07:30.90]Theo, you're awake.
[07:33.02]Am I?
[07:33.60]I'm skeptical.
[07:34.46]I had a messed up nightmare.
[07:37.35]Yeah, about that.
[07:39.33]Wait.
[07:40.89]Oh, yep.
[07:41.41]It's all coming back to me now.
[07:42.85]It's all coming back to you.
[07:44.43]Boomerang!
[07:45.47]From Cartoon Network.
[07:47.87]That actually happened.
[07:49.43]Thanks for getting us out of there.
[07:53.10]I'm glad we were in it together.
[07:57.10]I don't know if I could have done that alone.
[08:00.86]What?
[08:01.14]Is this the first time you get dialog choices?
[08:05.43]Only took him like seven hours into the game.
[08:09.13]Wait, why am I playing as this character?
[08:10.55]What's really going on here?
[08:13.69]Clay, this is not a normal mountain.
[08:17.30]What's really going on here?
[08:20.42]Should have told you sooner.
[08:21.60]Back at the old ruins, a Potomay escaped from a mirror.
[08:23.86]A Potomay I'm not very proud of.
[08:26.50]I swear I dreamt it.
[08:29.17]You think the mountain made her real?
[08:31.72]Yeah.
[08:32.90]She's been haunting me the whole time.
[08:34.46]She lashed out at Mr. Oshiro.
[08:36.39]I think she was the reason the gauntlet stalled off.
[08:39.31]She was there in the temple.
[08:41.89]Ah, fucking... Why didn't you say something, kid?
[08:44.81]I wouldn't have gone into that temple if I knew that mountain was capable of doing this shit.
[08:48.90]I tried to stop you.
[08:52.10]You could have mentioned that your demon doppelganger was on the loose.
[08:58.17]Come on, Theo.
[08:58.61]You know how crazy this sounds?
[09:00.86]I didn't even believe myself.
[09:03.68]Alright, alright, kid.
[09:05.54]I understand.
[09:06.34]Next time, just talk to me, though, alright?
[09:10.24]Promise I'll believe you.
[09:14.37]Voice actor.
[09:15.87]Okay.
[09:18.27]Which is the right one?
[09:21.71]Thank you for believing me.
[09:24.32]He's trapped in the bit.
[09:28.58]For believing in me back there, I mean.
[09:32.35]Believing in you was the easy part.
[09:34.51]I wish I could have helped.
[09:35.41]I was pretty useless stuck in that thing.
[09:38.93]Inside the cube.
[09:40.69]You actually helped a lot.
[09:42.17]Honestly, I couldn't have made it without your support.
[09:44.03]I don't want to do that one.
[09:48.15]Let's do this one.
[09:52.21]Why is it so easy for you to trust me?
[09:54.55]Seriously, you barely know me.
[09:57.49]Honestly, you remind me of my sister.
[10:01.55]That's adorable.
[10:03.31]What's she like?
[10:05.08]Oh, you love her.
[10:06.68]Actually, you might not get along at first, but you eventually would love her.
[10:10.66]She's a literal rock star.
[10:13.68]She's a musician, kid?
[10:15.32]That's so fucking awesome!
[10:16.66]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[10:18.30]I gotta end the stream.
[10:20.36]Okay, she's not literally a literal rock star.
[10:24.12]Alex is just amazing at everything.
[10:27.81]She's studying to be a civil rights lawyer.
[10:31.35]Wow.
[10:32.39]How do I remind you of her?
[10:34.83]You both live so deep inside your own heads.
[10:37.53]Oh.
[10:39.65]Alex has this amazing internal compass.
[10:41.69]It's obvious that she'll get where she needs to be.
[10:44.49]I can see that in you two.
[10:47.76]I wish I could say the same for myself.
[10:49.02]Uh.
[10:58.66]This isn't real close to the fire.
[11:02.02]I'm just realizing this now.
[11:05.50]Which one of them is going to put their hand in it to prove how good they are at video games, I wonder.
[11:11.50]Your sister sounds great!
[11:16.94]Your sister sounds great.
[11:18.02]Really remind you of her.
[11:20.51]That's a reference from last night if you weren't here.
[11:22.75]Are you kidding me?
[11:23.57]You're the one who's dead set on climbing the mountain and you don't even know why.
[11:27.59]That's classic Alex.
[11:31.86]Huh?
[11:33.90]I'm just teasing you.
[11:35.06]Why are you climbing the mountain anyways?
[11:38.92]I don't even know why.
[11:40.28]I just had to get out of my head.
[11:42.64]I'm stuck in a cycle.
[11:45.36]You're preaching to the choir here.
[11:47.78]I've had many a soul-destroying day job.
[11:51.28]Work is fine, actually.
[11:52.10]I just, uh, I'm going crazy.
[11:55.16]I guess I'm thinking about dumb crap that doesn't matter.
[11:58.35]My brain fixates on these stupid things that happened forever ago.
[12:02.21]I should be over them.
[12:04.53]None of it even matters.
[12:08.69]But.
[12:09.45]Oh, you didn't say but.
[12:13.00]I'm good at keeping up appearances, but the truth is I'm barely holding it together.
[12:17.40]Sorry, that's pretty rough.
[12:21.60]can I help you already are it feels good to say it out loud you don't talk to anyone about it no not really my mom knows I get depressed and I have panic attacks that's about it no wonder you feel trapped how do you cope with anything I drink mostly and get mad at people on the internet get mad at people on the internet
[12:58.17]I should get some sleep.
[13:00.19]Oh, are you sure you don't want to keep talking?
[13:02.39]I'm tired too, we have a lot to talk about.
[13:08.75]Fuckin' internet.
[13:09.95]Wait, skip?
[13:10.29]What do you mean skipping?
[13:11.27]I just said I was tired.
[13:12.67]I just told you I was tired.
[13:17.17]I didn't say I'm done with the conversation.
[13:19.84]I wasn't trying to skip it.
[13:24.80]I'm not skipping you're right I can sleep later see I just didn't know what I would jump checking all the dialog options I should get some sleep hey why what do you think built this temple anyways looks ancient it must predate everything else in the mountain the resort the ruins the city
[13:52.02]Either you skip or you stall.
[13:54.28]There ain't no in-between, apparently.
[13:59.10]There's a lot of history here.
[14:01.97]Yeah, the mountain has meant so many things to so many people.
[14:03.87]A mountain is always... It's always really, really pointed out here.
[14:11.45]Well, not really on a mountain.
[14:14.50]There's going to be some invisible ink scenario where it's going to be wiped away.
[14:17.04]And it's going to be like this.
[14:20.71]forest has meant so many things they're gonna be a forest just watching the trees behind me gonna be birds and that's where the bird comes from I don't understand why that crazy old lady lives here you ran into her too what's her deal I think she's just a mean person but she does seem pretty content living out here uh what uh would you mind talking about what depression is like
[14:51.94]Uh, it sucks.
[14:52.64]It's kind of hard to... That would be hard to answer.
[14:55.14]Yeah, but what does it feel like?
[15:00.32]Alex struggles a little too.
[15:01.06]I really want to understand.
[15:01.90]We can talk about something else if you want.
[15:05.69]It's like... I'm at the bottom of the ocean.
[15:08.93]I can't see anything in any direction.
[15:10.09]It's claustrophobic, yet I feel exposed.
[15:12.05]I remember feeling normal.
[15:18.47]But now it just feels out of reach, no matter what I try.
[15:21.98]And again, I was probably always messed up.
[15:26.38]It just took something hurtful to bring it out.
[15:28.34]There must be something wrong with me.
[15:33.67]No.
[15:34.31]I don't believe that.
[15:40.09]What happened, I'm sure it's not your fault.
[15:47.47]By the way, if you are depressed and you're having problems...
[15:53.95]It's not... Sometimes it's not in your control.
[15:57.49]So... Blaming yourself is the worst possible thing you can do.
[16:01.97]Because... A lot of times it has something to do with something you can't even control yourself.
[16:12.64]I guess I thought that I could.
[16:13.76]I don't know.
[16:16.36]I'm just floating in this abyss, swimming in a random direction.
[16:21.78]Hoping that I find something.
[16:22.82]That's really why I'm here.
[16:24.08]But I can't escape myself.
[16:31.14]I'm literally fighting myself the entire way.
[16:33.28]Maybe this is all pointless.
[16:36.74]John, you just saved my life.
[16:38.08]That's not pointless.
[16:41.96]Yeah.
[16:45.18]Look, you're a good person.
[16:46.20]You're a little intense, but you're a good person.
[16:48.34]I think you're just trying to push out of that rut you're stuck in.
[16:53.54]And that's a totally legit reason to climb the mountain.
[16:56.95]Maybe.
[16:57.77]That's helpful.
[17:01.19]This part of you that's haunting you, maybe she comes with the territory.
[17:03.75]So you think I'm stuck with her forever.
[17:08.49]Well, she's stuck with you too.
[17:11.01]That's not helpful.
[17:18.41]So you want to destroy this part of you.
[17:22.33]Won't that hurt you too?
[17:25.09]If I don't, she's just gonna keep bullying me.
[17:26.77]She says she's protecting me, but that's obviously not true.
[17:28.99]Maybe she thinks she is.
[17:31.43]She could be some kind of twisted defense mechanism.
[17:36.84]Honestly, who cares?
[17:38.30]She has so much control over me.
[17:39.98]I hate it.
[17:40.42]Maybe you can learn to control her instead.
[17:43.26]The father... The feather helps a lot.
[17:47.82]Thanks for teaching me that.
[17:49.03]The father, like... Just one of my grandpa's many nuggets of wisdom.
[17:57.40]The father.
[17:59.56]The priest.
[18:00.26]That's what I got out of that, somehow.
[18:01.94]I don't know, my brain is... What brought you to the mountain?
[18:10.63]Why?
[18:10.87]Okay, why are you on the mountain?
[18:12.29]Why are you here?
[18:13.04]What brought you to the mountain?
[18:15.91]I'm just kind of bumming around.
[18:17.23]As usual.
[18:17.41]Now that I'm saying it out loud, I realize how flakey it sounds.
[18:22.41]That's a day-old joke.
[18:23.17]That's not a day-old joke.
[18:43.92]That's a game, a current game reference.
[18:48.93]Just because we said this yesterday, we're in the same game.
[18:54.31]We got the same references.
[18:55.61]Because we're doing the same thing, right?
[19:00.68]It just sounds like you're under a lot of pressure.
[19:03.16]Not really.
[19:04.14]Everyone is so patient with me, though I guess I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself.
[19:07.18]Maybe.
[19:30.04]Same game, same jokes.
[19:32.12]That's not a joke.
[19:33.80]I just said he was probably from some random city in America and like Ohio and it turned out to be Seattle.
[19:40.00]So in my, in my headcanon, it's Ohio.
[19:46.49]Where's the auto clicker?
[19:58.29]That's a boring headcanon.
[19:59.91]Why?
[20:00.59]What?
[20:00.83]You're close to your grandmother.
[20:03.67]You're close to your grandfather.
[20:04.77]Are you close?
[20:06.14]Father.
[20:06.92]Yeah, I was.
[20:07.44]Oh, I'm sorry.
[20:09.98]It's okay.
[20:10.58]That's just how it is.
[20:16.32]All I can do is stay positive and live a meaningful life because that's what he would want.
[20:22.08]I'm so sorry, Theo.
[20:23.94]Thanks.
[20:30.10]You know what?
[20:31.20]I want to remember this night.
[20:32.50]Let's take a selfie.
[20:35.92]I thought you'd never ask.
[20:52.55]You know, despite everything, I feel pretty good right now.
[20:55.39]Wait a second.
[20:56.43]You're gonna reach the summit tomorrow?
[21:01.04]Don't jonks it!
[21:02.84]Because I am currently John Jonks.
[21:08.52]I tried with that one.
[21:09.32]Yeah, I'm excited.
[21:10.16]I'm ready to put this all behind me.
[21:12.70]I'll be cheering you on.
[21:13.78]Yeah, but that's... If I'm in a Jex moment, if Jex takes over and does really well and I fail, I jinxed myself.
[21:21.12]I jonksed myself.
[21:21.84]That's a Jonks moment.
[21:23.08]That's a Jonks.
[21:23.60]That's a John.
[21:24.76]Figured it out.
[21:25.20]Got it.
[21:25.44]I'll be cheering you on.
[21:26.74]We should get some sleep.
[21:28.76]Okay, goodnight, Theo.
[21:30.82]Thanks for being cool.
[21:34.34]What can I say?
[21:36.58]What can I say?
[21:37.13]It comes naturally.
[21:41.47]Let me just make sure I got that good feel here.
[21:48.76]I do.
[21:51.40]Alright.
[21:52.12]Grab it.
[21:54.00]I now can... Okay, you go supersonic.
[22:01.08]New mechanic, the supersonic.
[22:06.22]Gotta dash into these ones.
[22:12.35]I'm probably missing a secret or something.
[22:15.15]What is he saying, Smash Brothers?
[22:17.25]He growls, and he says, now I'll show you, and he goes, now I'll show you!
[22:23.13]That's exactly how he does it, too.
[22:24.75]Like, you might have thought that was terrible, and we're dropping frames here.
[22:27.84]Oh, fuck.
[22:33.66]The northern lights are so beautiful.
[22:36.67]Yeah, they are.
[22:40.87]Where are we?
[22:43.71]We need to talk.
[22:45.69]Okay, wait, am I... Did I get to the summit?
[22:49.03]I'm above the summit.
[22:54.82]I did it.
[22:56.85]I finally understand who you are.
[22:57.99]You're not my true reflection.
[22:59.49]I'm not?
[23:02.41]You're everything I need to leave behind.
[23:04.50]You're cruel, paranoid, controlling.
[23:07.70]Why would you say that?
[23:10.22]No, it's okay.
[23:11.10]I understand now.
[23:12.60]I don't need you anymore.
[23:15.45]So you're just abandoning me?
[23:18.59]I'm setting you free.
[23:20.47]We'll both be so much happier.
[23:23.05]You're so...
[23:25.10]So... Stupid!
[23:29.36]You think you can just leave me behind?
[23:30.88]You think you can blame everything on me?
[23:33.92]You think you're above me?
[23:36.40]That's right, I'm crawling out of the panel.
[23:38.58]Answer me.
[23:41.16]Calm down.
[23:44.46]Calm down.
[23:46.88]Breathe.
[23:48.58]Use the feather.
[23:53.17]But I don't have my, I don't have my box!
[24:04.35]It's gonna take me a minute.
[24:08.04]It actually would probably be pretty hard to breathe right now.
[24:11.46]With a tendril wrapped around my diaphragm, squeezing, right?
[24:16.70]I didn't do it.
[24:22.65]Uh, you're going to think about a feather to stop me.
[24:30.11]You are not above me, and you can't climb this mountain.
[24:33.97]It's time to accept that.
[24:35.39]Oh, what's happening?
[24:57.40]Oh, god damn it.
[25:04.01]Glass!
[25:07.83]Oh, come on.
[25:10.73]That's alright.
[25:11.97]I fell a long way.
[25:13.15]I did the movie fall.
[25:15.37]Where you fall an incredibly long way, but you land on something that will save you every time.
[25:20.72]Alright, what do we got?
[25:24.18]Secret?
[25:28.42]Couldn't get the landing, no.
[25:29.82]I couldn't get the... I'm making a joke for the video landing.
[25:34.08]Where I land and go... That's what I was going to do.
[25:37.90]I was going to say... And... It's funny in hindsight here, looking back.
[25:42.32]That actually would probably not have been funny at all.
[25:44.82]Alright, let's see.
[25:46.84]You're going to bring you over here.
[25:48.16]What's down here?
[25:50.52]Maybe smash through here?
[25:53.42]No.
[25:56.78]Well...
[25:59.51]back up, maybe?
[26:01.77]How about down here?
[26:02.39]No, I think I'm going to ride you back up.
[26:06.01]Uh-huh.
[26:10.29]Oh, another feather.
[26:13.01]Ooh!
[26:13.37]Alright.
[26:29.08]Now what?
[26:29.44]I guess just go up.
[26:39.93]No, nothing over there.
[26:40.67]Any water?
[26:42.01]Inside the water fountain?
[26:44.67]Well, I don't know.
[26:46.16]Uh...
[26:50.83]Okay, I want you to take a look at what just happened there.
[26:53.53]I'm very curious and serious about this.
[26:57.85]I pressed up on the controller.
[26:59.65]Straight up.
[27:00.75]And I went left and right.
[27:02.77]I want to make sure you understand.
[27:03.71]I just need to make sure people know that.
[27:06.34]I didn't do that.
[27:06.84]Let's see.
[27:14.76]I'm going to take this over here.
[27:22.36]Wait, no!
[27:24.26]Can he break all that?
[27:25.10]Hold on.
[27:27.04]I think I can break all that shit up there.
[27:28.36]No, fuck.
[27:33.35]No!
[27:55.45]No, fuck.
[27:58.57]It's kind of awkward to do.
[27:59.79]Alright, tell me if I'm wasting my time here.
[28:02.65]Can I actually have him go up and break through that?
[28:06.43]Or is this just a waste of time?
[28:14.53]Ow.
[28:16.23]Maybe.
[28:16.63]It might be possible.
[28:17.45]I'll try it one more time.
[28:19.27]Doesn't work.
[28:29.73]I don't care.
[28:30.27]I don't care if it's a hundred thousand extra points.
[28:46.00]It is possible, isn't it?
[28:53.82]I guess it doesn't matter at all.
[28:58.97]Shit.
[29:11.13]It's very easy.
[29:13.33]Well, obviously not, considering I couldn't do it.
[29:15.91]Oh shit, okay.
[29:37.86]So let's go this way.
[29:45.65]To the right.
[29:55.83]It's a giant mirror.
[29:56.85]Alright, we're so close.
[30:02.32]It's over now.
[30:02.94]Why won't she leave me alone?
[30:04.18]I hate her.
[30:10.57]I'll never be able to get rid of her.
[30:12.11]And she was right.
[30:13.05]I couldn't climb the mountain.
[30:16.53]No, that's not... I'm still on the mountain.
[30:19.16]So... You know what I mean?
[30:22.14]I did climb the mountain.
[30:25.74]Don't let people in chat tell you you didn't do it.
[30:28.63]Don't let them say that.
[30:32.57]They'll use the little semantics to make it so you didn't climb it.
[30:35.47]You got to the top of that mountain.
[30:42.30]You fell off the top of the mountain, but you still got up there.
[30:53.85]You flew to the top.
[30:55.11]That's cheating.
[30:55.65]Uh-uh.
[30:57.16]Uh-uh.
[30:58.40]No.
[31:00.18]See, there they go again.
[31:01.70]There's the semantics to try to tell you you didn't do something.
[31:15.38]I'm gonna break you through here.
[31:20.28]No, fuck.
[31:20.92]Wrong way.
[31:21.30]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[31:28.11]God.
[31:29.29]I don't know why this, for some reason, this, this, this thing in particular is just my brain and has trouble doing this of all the things in the game.
[31:41.22]Can I go through the top?
[31:45.76]I might be able to break through the top.
[31:55.70]No.
[31:56.67]Worth a shot.
[32:04.83]He conquered the mountain horizontally.
[32:10.33]So, um... I guess I'm just supposed to go up there?
[32:15.37]With the feather, but... I'm gonna be out the side here?
[32:17.89]What's over here?
[32:22.47]What is this?
[32:41.34]I can get that.
[32:47.62]Fuck, come on.
[32:50.35]No!
[32:51.53]Noooo!
[32:52.37]I got him.
[32:52.71]I don't even know what the hell's up here.
[32:57.75]I'm gonna just look.
[33:03.50]Nothing, so I gotta go to the left, but man, I'm gonna fall because I don't know what's over there.
[33:13.65]But what about what what's over here shit I Can't hold on anything.
[33:23.00]Oh god damn it all the way to the left.
[33:26.92]Well, might as well get it up here.
[33:28.80]Oh
[33:44.09]Okay, let's go.
[33:49.07]Okay.
[33:50.75]Nothing else up here?
[33:51.48]I mean, there is, but...
[34:14.25]Hmm.
[34:15.77]Uh-oh.
[34:17.01]Time to get trapped in a puzzle.
[34:19.37]What can I do?
[34:25.54]Can I even do anything here?
[34:28.16]Have to sing?
[34:40.85]Didn't I just try to do that?
[34:41.74]I swear to god I dashed into that.
[34:48.84]Alright, look at the bottom here.
[34:53.40]So we've got play, pause, play in reverse.
[35:03.89]Now we've got play.
[35:05.85]Yeah, pause.
[35:14.01]I don't think I can even do anything with this.
[35:15.37]Can I touch them?
[35:20.62]There's something missing here.
[35:21.70]Maybe I have to get it.
[35:26.76]I can't do anything with this statue, right?
[35:39.83]It's the Infinity Gauntlet.
[35:55.41]Well, I really, I don't have any idea.
[36:03.39]Elevator close button?
[36:07.34]What the hell is the elevator close button?
[36:13.88]You should have jumped for the platform.
[36:16.47]It's a dash pattern?
[36:31.36]Okay, well, how do I know what sound it is?
[36:32.80]Those are all... Okay, so, hold on a minute.
[36:38.65]Wait, wait, wait.
[36:40.07]There's two light purples.
[36:48.10]I don't know what it... I don't know what the sequence would be, though.
[36:53.06]The pattern comes from chapter one.
[36:54.95]Okay, so I'm...
[36:57.43]I mean, at this point, I'm in the room.
[36:58.57]There's no way I can do it unless I go back to Chapter 1.
[37:01.33]Okay.
[37:09.07]Well, I guess I can't do it.
[37:13.74]It's impossible?
[37:14.50]Okay.
[37:15.88]Could just Google it.
[37:16.94]Yeah, but I could.
[37:17.92]I could.
[37:18.40]What is it?
[37:29.65]What is it?
[37:29.99]What's the secret?
[37:32.03]You want it?
[37:32.51]Yeah?
[37:32.81]What is it?
[37:33.09]I'm cheating.
[37:39.68]I'm ch- Well, I didn't get the thing in the first chapter, and... Like, I want- I want to do that!
[37:43.76]I want it!
[37:44.98]What's the- what's the password?
[37:46.62]It comes up later, does it?
[38:01.20]I highly recommend you just skip this.
[38:09.83]No, that's- did you give me the Konami code?
[38:13.43]That's not the correct- what- how do I do it?
[38:18.29]That one didn't work either.
[38:36.59]I don't care.
[38:37.95]It's a secret that I didn't get.
[38:39.17]It's a thing I missed in the first chapter.
[38:40.73]I'm sure it's fun in there.
[38:51.32]Up, up, down, down.
[38:52.54]Stop!
[38:53.58]Up, up, left, right, left, right, down, right, up.
[38:56.54]Stop!
[38:56.92]No!
[38:57.22]God damn it!
[39:01.16]Up, up.
[39:01.54]Does it do it again?
[39:09.54]Use the handy IGN guide.
[39:10.96]I can't click on that.
[39:11.86]That means I have to alt tab.
[39:14.46]Up, left, down, right.
[39:18.76]Up, right, left.
[39:20.20]Up, left.
[39:21.08]That didn't do anything.
[39:24.30]Up, up, down, right, left.
[39:34.91]Press play first.
[39:45.22]You guys are putting random shit in here.
[39:48.06]Up.
[39:50.70]Right.
[39:55.07]Left.
[39:56.27]It didn't work.
[39:59.11]I'm not doing diagonal dashes.
[40:03.21]You guys didn't say diagonal.
[40:05.19]You're saying left.
[40:07.11]Oh, you're saying... No, say D. Up, upright.
[40:10.58]God damn it.
[40:11.34]Up.
[40:12.24]Left.
[40:13.82]Down, right.
[40:18.48]Up, left, down, right.
[40:24.83]There's too many things.
[40:27.49]Just clear it, clear it, clear it.
[40:31.05]Up, left, down, right.
[40:35.08]Up, right, left, up, left.
[40:37.30]Got it!
[40:40.00]Alright, what's... Hold on a second, guys.
[40:44.28]Is...
[40:48.06]Wait, wait, wait.
[40:48.48]Let me be very, very... I gotta ask this.
[40:49.97]I need a mod to answer this question because I don't trust anybody in here giving me up, up, down, downs.
[40:55.35]Um, is... That first one I didn't know, but am I about to just cheat through the whole thing?
[41:01.45]Like, do I not have the information to do the rest of this?
[41:04.85]Or will I get it eventually?
[41:10.19]So, don't just do this.
[41:11.71]Like, that first one I didn't know because I wasn't going to get it.
[41:16.52]baked flakes, who cares?
[41:43.93]I'm not doing it.
[41:45.69]I got the one that I couldn't get.
[41:46.99]I'm gonna move on.
[41:48.83]I'm gonna... No, I'm not cheating.
[41:52.54]No cheating.
[41:53.62]Look, I'm the villain in the movie that realizes what he's doing is wrong.
[42:10.44]No, fuck.
[42:18.10]You know what I'm saying?
[42:19.64]I can't just have you guys give me the answers.
[42:23.67]Nothing up there?
[42:24.17]Alright, what's the next one?
[42:32.89]Just do it.
[42:42.73]Who cares?
[42:48.40]Who gives a shit?
[42:49.96]What's this next one?
[42:50.74]Alright, torch three.
[43:01.93]Just look it up on your phone.
[43:04.32]Up, up, down, down, nope.
[43:16.74]Fuck, I missed it.
[43:17.42]I didn't get it right.
[43:23.90]Alright, what's Torch for?
[43:41.25]I don't fucking remember I did this, okay?
[44:05.16]Alright, got it.
[44:05.72]I did it.
[44:06.44]Now everybody can go back.
[44:08.06]Go back to bed.
[44:11.10]I cheated.
[44:11.72]No, you cheated.
[44:12.74]Hey, I may have committed the crime, but you drove the car.
[44:19.28]No, no, no, no, no.
[44:20.03]I drove the car.
[44:21.31]This is my stream.
[44:22.41]This is my broadcast.
[44:23.61]I'm the driver.
[44:25.57]You committed the crime.
[44:27.05]I'm the driver.
[44:28.11]In fact, you're way more at fault than I am.
[44:30.03]You're gonna go to jail for way longer.
[44:34.38]And yes, I am the driver.
[44:35.16]I may have told you to commit that crime, but you still committed it.
[44:49.92]I said, hey, can you, like, commit that crime for me?
[44:52.36]I'll drive you if you do.
[44:54.12]And you're like, sure.
[44:57.98]Well, okay.
[45:01.92]Okay.
[45:06.60]Did I open it?
[45:07.72]I opened it.
[45:08.35]Another one of these.
[45:18.45]It's gonna be a cassette tape.
[45:20.23]Yeah.
[45:23.65]If they're not over 18, it's the adult who is driving that is at fault.
[45:29.27]Oops.
[45:52.80]What did I do that for?
[45:53.62]I'm a fucking god.
[45:57.14]I'm a god!
[45:57.76]I'm gonna B-side.
[46:23.82]Now where the hell do I go?
[46:24.52]There's a way to the right?
[46:32.63]No.
[46:37.61]Up right, up left right.
[46:38.69]Stop giving me codes for the crystal room.
[46:40.95]I already did that.
[46:41.52]I don't know where to go.
[46:43.54]I don't know where to go now.
[46:45.58]You guys are writing codes for the crystal room.
[46:47.42]We already did that.
[46:53.92]Bottom right, top left, top right.
[46:56.01]Right, right.
[46:57.37]Where the fuck did I go?
[47:04.82]Don't do it.
[47:08.12]Don't!
[47:27.14]I can leave the screen by going this right.
[47:32.67]What if I go up, up, right, right, up, right?
[47:36.17]Oh, okay, I hold on.
[47:37.27]Up, up, up, right, up, right.
[47:42.43]Nothing?
[47:44.14]No.
[47:47.42]Just climb the mountain.
[47:51.88]What does this do for me?
[47:58.88]There has to be a reason why I can get in here.
[48:00.32]Nah.
[48:01.08]I don't even need that thing.
[48:07.24]Watch this.
[48:07.94]Okay, I think I need that thing.
[48:15.97]Oh, shit!
[48:37.67]Fuck.
[48:44.74]This can't go up, can it?
[48:45.90]No.
[48:47.20]Just climb it.
[48:47.82]Oh, alright.
[48:59.09]I... Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[49:01.17]For some reason I thought I had to go up.
[49:02.55]There's two walls and a long corridor going up.
[49:05.81]I thought I had to jump it.
[49:11.49]Oh shit!
[49:12.25]I have to grab onto the other side.
[49:16.04]Oh my god, that's actually going to be kind of annoying.
[49:40.50]No stop.
[49:43.82]I'm telling you, these block people are causing me huge problems.
[49:50.75]It's because when I was bouncing off, I didn't know if... Look, have you seen me fuck up the feather once?
[49:55.07]Oh fuck.
[50:16.81]Uh, I need to stand up, I think.
[50:26.87]Stand up and, I don't know, I have to jump, just like launch?
[50:29.49]Okay.
[50:31.25]Fine.
[50:32.18]Zoom.
[50:47.77]I hate these things.
[50:48.51]I really do.
[50:49.23]I don't like these things.
[50:51.69]You just have to jump and then fall and grab.
[50:59.65]I could have gone up.
[51:01.11]What is that thing?
[51:13.00]Pinball?
[51:13.92]It is pinball.
[51:18.96]Anything I can do in here?
[51:26.50]Let's see what's up.
[51:33.90]Oh.
[51:34.42]Oh.
[51:53.01]I'm just gonna keep going until I run into something.
[51:56.17]Down or up?
[51:56.69]I guess I'm gonna do down.
[52:11.15]Oh, it's a bubble!
[52:29.33]What am I supposed to do?
[52:31.15]Well, I'm gonna break them all because I'm gonna take a guess here and say that I have to fly through all of this.
[52:42.30]Or something.
[52:46.94]I wonder if I'm correct.
[52:57.15]Nothing else in any of these walls?
[53:04.78]Gonna break this one.
[53:05.66]Get those up and around.
[53:10.21]If I was a video game, I would definitely have a scenario where I have to fly frizzes.
[53:18.70]But, oops.
[53:37.32]I have to bounce off?
[53:38.10]Ooh, he's looking at me.
[53:48.25]Alright.
[53:49.01]Now.
[53:50.53]Wow.
[53:55.53]What did I hit?
[53:56.13]Should I just smash into these things?
[54:00.60]Hmm?
[54:04.50]Up?
[54:13.43]That has to be a point to that, right?
[54:16.29]Is it no point of a feather?
[54:17.39]Huh.
[54:23.30]To go up.
[54:23.80]I don't know.
[54:39.07]-2 for the stream title.
[54:40.99]Oh, I forgot about the stream title.
[54:42.11]You're right.
[54:45.02]Come on.
[54:45.44]What's the point of this?
[54:48.18]Nothing at all.
[54:50.38]I don't believe that at all.
[54:51.62]I'm sorry.
[54:59.23]Move it down.
[55:11.92]Am I in a maze or something?
[55:13.10]Or am I just progressing in a way that I can progress?
[55:22.15]Just skip that one, right?
[55:28.65]Okay, gotta go bounce from that top right one to the bottom left one.
[55:33.21]Stop saying passwords for the thing!
[55:48.48]Well, that was wrong.
[55:49.28]Oh, I guess I have to dash left into it.
[55:54.42]Flame X-Buck.
[56:04.63]Just use cheats.
[56:13.23]Bubble?
[56:18.42]I was pretty good at this in Yoshi's Island.
[56:28.57]The helicopter levels?
[56:30.39]You're probably wondering, my god, how does he do it?
[56:34.79]My hands were on the controller, so it might be a bit of work.
[57:03.95]I made it to the lift.
[57:06.83]Oh, hello again.
[57:07.53]Of course you're here.
[57:13.02]It really doesn't seem like he enjoys the game and is just panicking about how he has to play it right.
[57:19.00]What?
[57:23.64]I think this game's great.
[57:28.17]It's just... it's hard.
[57:31.38]Look, you can't do it perfect the first time.
[57:35.62]What?
[57:42.48]Didn't we already go over this?
[57:46.58]Like, if you, okay, if you made me a treasure map, and you made a, and I've never, I don't even, you made me a treasure map in a state I've never been to before.
[57:57.08]Jeremy, I've got a really cool treasure map for you.
[57:59.38]What you're gonna do is you're gonna find the treasure, and I've hid it somewhere, and there's an elaborate set of instructions that you're gonna go through.
[58:06.40]Alright, cool.
[58:07.33]And you hand me the paper, you hand me the treasure map.
[58:09.11]I've never been to the state of Utah before in my life.
[58:12.25]It's in Utah!
[58:14.41]And I close the door in the car, right?
[58:16.73]Like, I get in the car, and I... Door closes.
[58:20.77]Engine turns on.
[58:23.31]At the window.
[58:25.84]Yeah, roll the window down.
[58:26.74]Yeah, what's up, man?
[58:28.46]Hey, uh, why have you not, uh, why have you not been to the, uh, why have you not been to the treasure yet?
[58:35.62]What are you talking about, man?
[58:38.64]Why did you, you were supposed to take a left at the statue at the Interstate 91.
[58:43.36]I, I know, but I don't know that.
[58:49.00]I have the treasure in my hand.
[58:49.94]You just gave it to me.
[58:50.84]I'm trying to, I don't, I haven't seen that.
[58:52.86]I've never been to the state before.
[58:54.77]Wait, hold on.
[58:55.21]You've never been to Utah before?
[58:56.63]You're terrible.
[58:58.82]Okay.
[59:00.40]Thanks for the treasure map, by the way.
[59:04.72]Okay.
[59:05.34]Roll the window up and then I leave.
[59:06.88]And you throw in a rock when I'm leaving.
[59:21.55]No, what I'm saying is...
[59:24.66]There's no way to play the game right.
[59:26.57]I've never even seen the game.
[59:27.93]I'm getting new mechanics introduced to me on an hourly basis.
[59:43.37]You didn't take a left at that road that you had never been on before.
[59:45.93]Well, I gotta read the map first, man.
[59:56.24]It was just one guy.
[59:57.48]It's over!
[60:09.70]That's probably for the best.
[60:15.59]No treasure for you, Utah hater!
[60:18.71]What?
[60:19.01]I've just said I've never been to Utah!
[60:20.95]That's a whole nother map you just made for me!
[60:24.69]No, you just like doctored chat footage of me.
[60:28.03]The mountain doesn't pull any punches.
[60:33.41]Yeah, I get it.
[60:34.27]I wasn't strong enough to climb your stupid mountain.
[60:36.93]Long story short, this game's a lot of fun.
[60:41.65]I'm very much enjoying this game.
[60:43.22]I hate the game.
[60:44.42]Where are you getting that from?
[60:45.32]What treasure map have you handed me?
[60:50.00]I wasn't strong enough to climb your stupid mountain.
[60:56.36]You can laugh at me again all you want.
[61:00.92]I didn't mean actually laugh.
[61:10.19]He hates this game.
[61:12.22]Why would I stream it for another day in a row if I hated the fucking game?
[61:18.28]Sometimes you gotta know when to throw in the towel.
[61:20.76]You'll get over it.
[61:26.23]You know what?
[61:26.59]I had a lot of time to think climbing out of this cave.
[61:31.26]And I'm already over it.
[61:34.20]That part of me was right.
[61:35.26]I can't do this.
[61:42.06]I'll just go home to my sad life and be miserable forever.
[61:45.67]You clearly aren't over it.
[61:51.09]I don't want to give up.
[61:52.27]But no matter how hard I try, she sabotages me every step of the way.
[61:56.39]A lot of kids come here to climb this mountain only to give up.
[61:59.52]It's a shame that you fell.
[62:00.42]I was starting to think you'd make it.
[62:03.46]What makes me so special?
[62:06.78]I've never met someone so angry at themselves.
[62:10.05]Honestly, I thought you'd reach the summit just to spite yourself.
[62:14.49]Gee, thanks.
[62:18.79]This girl you're talking about, it sounds like she's holding you back.
[62:21.26]Talk to her.
[62:22.46]Hey girl, why is she so scared?
[62:25.57]You think she's scared?
[62:26.59]I guess I never thought of it that way.
[62:31.31]Stop wasting both of our time and ask her.
[62:33.11]What have you got to lose?
[62:34.35]I don't know how to find her.
[62:48.37]She's part of you, right?
[62:50.71]If you look for her, she won't take long to find.
[62:53.90]So you know about the mountain's power.
[62:57.32]Of course I know.
[62:57.96]I live here.
[62:59.50]I tried to warn you.
[63:01.80]Need to work on your messaging.
[63:05.26]I'm sorry for being the one guy.
[63:07.13]Well, it happened again.
[63:09.17]And that's twice in one stream, and that, you know, that gets you... I'm not supposed to be doing that.
[63:17.85]A glimpse of the truth is good for people, even if most can't accept what they see.
[63:24.32]Why would I ban him?
[63:25.98]What are you talking about?
[63:26.74]That's a valued member of this community.
[63:30.04]They're not gonna get banned.
[63:33.32]There's no shame in running back to your car and driving away.
[63:36.10]Hey!
[63:36.80]Hey!
[63:38.80]What?
[63:39.04]You not in Utah yet?
[63:41.12]No, no, I just closed the door.
[63:49.06]Where can I find a fucking rock?
[63:52.10]Someday you'll be ready and then you'll come back.
[63:56.92]No.
[63:57.58]I'm gonna see this through.
[64:00.50]There's no shame in driving to Utah.
[64:04.32]Oh, that's right.
[64:04.86]I gotta stop.
[64:05.52]I gotta be very quiet, because the louder I am, there's a chance that I can wake up Shito.
[64:12.59]And I don't want to do that.
[64:14.03]He's been having a really relaxing day.
[64:16.71]No more running.
[64:18.21]I thought so.
[64:18.85]Good luck.
[64:21.29]Good luck.
[64:24.39]So, let's go.
[64:26.69]Utah is a five minute drive from Las Vegas.
[64:29.09]It is not a five minute drive.
[64:34.87]It's five minutes.
[64:37.79]Your map ain't even correct.
[64:39.05]I, in fact, I take your map and I drive to the place that you put on that location.
[64:45.46]I get lost.
[64:47.76]A fucking wolf.
[64:49.56]like runs in front of the car and like barks and I have to smear off the side of the road and I crash and I get out I have no cell phone reception I'm like where the fuck am I?
[64:57.97]and like I call you and I go hey man uh just was I'm curious what's with this map you gave me is this even how do I is this I'm not I don't think I'm in Utah and you hang the phone up I'm still stuck in the fucking middle and I don't know where I am how can you stand living here?
[65:17.70]isn't it hard to deal with this all the time?
[65:21.25]It's true, you never really get used to it, but it keeps me sharp.
[65:27.63]That's a funny prank, to be honest.
[65:30.25]I like that.
[65:32.80]The mountain is so confrontational.
[65:39.64]Streamer dies after listening to a chat member.
[65:43.10]Sure, it doesn't beat around the bush.
[65:45.08]Celeste Mountain is a place of healing.
[65:51.33]So this is stop talking.
[65:55.25]Stop.
[65:55.63]What do you mean stop?
[65:56.47]This is a live stream.
[65:57.91]Stop talking.
[65:59.75]Oh, God damn it.
[66:01.89]I'm sorry.
[66:02.41]She don't, she don't.
[66:05.55]I'm sorry.
[66:06.09]I'm sorry.
[66:06.49]I'm sorry.
[66:06.71]I'm sorry.
[66:06.99]It's okay.
[66:14.17]It's okay.
[66:14.49]Yeah, it's okay.
[66:16.58]Back to sleep.
[66:17.08]Back to sleep.
[66:19.72]It's okay.
[66:23.72]Yeah, okay.
[66:25.02]Good boy.
[66:25.64]I'm sorry.
[66:26.12]Okay.
[66:32.36]See what I'm fucking saying?
[66:34.92]Stop.
[66:36.60]Wouldn't have fucking happened if I wasn't talking about this fucking car thing.
[66:41.61]Okay, shh.
[66:43.73]Celeste Mountain is a place of healing, dear.
[66:48.31]The first step of healing is confronting the problem.
[66:52.82]It's never easy.
[66:58.24]Tell me about it.
[67:03.49]What is it?
[67:04.81]Shito?
[67:05.35]No, it's Shito.
[67:07.73]Shito is my actually alive automaton.
[67:12.36]Near automaton friend.
[67:30.23]Okay, I guess I'm just gonna walk into this.
[67:38.57]What's next?
[67:39.07]Alright, we gotta walk.
[67:42.76]Wait, secret.
[67:45.98]No.
[67:48.86]Well.
[67:50.68]Oh shit.
[67:51.82]Oh!
[67:53.13]Wait.
[67:54.13]Was I supposed to?
[67:55.33]Come on, I guess I can just go down.
[68:01.20]There are no more secrets.
[68:06.55]Oh, fuck.
[68:14.63]Ah, there are no more secrets?
[68:15.57]Are you sure about that?
[68:28.08]Oh!
[68:34.73]Where am I fucking going?
[68:38.73]Wait a minute.
[68:50.32]Wait a second.
[68:53.08]Hold on.
[68:57.46]No, I think maybe if you didn't touch anything.
[69:04.41]I thought maybe it would just go all the way down.
[69:11.60]Just do the fucking thing.
[69:15.16]I can't do the speed strategy.
[69:26.83]It could go that way.
[69:39.74]Okay, it's right, left, right.
[69:51.22]Where are my berries?
[69:53.26]I didn't even say it right.
[69:55.36]Sorry.
[69:55.62]Nothing over there.
[70:06.26]That feeling... that face when you will never be the one guy.
[70:10.78]Sure about that?
[70:12.88]Where am I?
[70:13.90]No, this is just Battletoads.
[70:31.37]No, it's not.
[70:36.28]How much further do I have to go?
[70:38.44]Let's do it again.
[70:39.54]I'm just kidding.
[70:40.62]Jump, jump.
[70:40.98]Uh-oh.
[70:41.16]Found you looking for me.
[70:42.44]I thought you were done with me.
[71:03.70]That was a mistake.
[71:04.84]I'm sorry.
[71:06.80]You think you've got it all figured out?
[71:08.70]You think you don't need me?
[71:11.37]I said I'm sorry.
[71:13.49]We need to move past this.
[71:16.03]You expect me to trust you?
[71:20.37]You aren't innocent here either.
[71:23.01]But I know you're scared.
[71:25.03]Look, we're at rock bottom.
[71:26.55]There's no point in fighting.
[71:29.91]I can keep digging.
[71:31.62]I can pull us down to the center of the Earth.
[71:36.32]What would be the point?
[71:38.24]Let's climb out of here.
[71:39.86]Together.
[71:42.90]Come close to me and I'll make you regret it.
[71:59.13]Do I have to just bop you again?
[72:14.27]Okay, so it's just a question of... I hit it.
[72:19.25]I hit you.
[72:21.73]You just have to touch it.
[72:22.97]Okay.
[72:27.69]Watch out for the falling cubes.
[72:32.29]Nowhere to go.
[72:34.24]Tip down.
[72:34.74]There you go.
[72:37.54]Laser?
[72:37.86]Alright, so there's like a half second on it.
[73:04.57]Where have I heard that sound before?
[73:09.40]I swear to god I've heard this sound somewhere.
[73:12.20]Like a Super Nintendo game.
[73:51.90]Oh no, Xbox controller, why have you given me a wrong pressure map?
[74:07.42]Where'd the platform go?
[74:29.18]Oh, shut up.
[74:40.22]Not you guys, I'm talking about...
[74:59.54]Oh, you had to do the little ball there.
[75:00.98]Come on.
[75:06.65]Ah!
[75:08.97]Damn it.
[75:16.38]I stupid.
[75:17.56]I had it.
[75:18.82]Keep overcompensating.
[75:23.90]Wave at the ball.
[75:43.59]How much further are you gonna go?
[75:49.86]I can make that without it.
[75:51.26]Without using it.
[75:52.62]No I can't.
[76:22.13]Oh, that's a big turn.
[76:23.43]Okay, I gotta start that way earlier.
[76:42.74]This is a long string of events.
[77:00.49]Oh shit, I didn't even see the fucking spikes!
[77:14.57]Oh fuck!
[77:15.37]I'm so used to this!
[77:16.69]That's the end right there, I got it.
[77:26.74]What are you doing?
[77:27.48]Stop, just jump over normally.
[77:29.00]Don't, shh, I don't wanna wake him up.
[77:59.82]This is the Kaizo block!
[78:22.27]I did you a favor.
[78:27.18]You aren't a mountain climber.
[78:30.49]I'm just trying to help you!
[78:31.85]None of this would have happened if you had just listened to me.
[78:38.50]We're still going.
[78:46.36]We're still going!
[78:51.01]Oh!
[78:55.51]Really?
[78:58.69]Oops, probably should have jumped.
[79:08.10]I got it, okay, we're fine.
[79:27.56]Stupid spike was there Stupid jelly spikes Oh my god They're up too high, delete those
[80:00.19]Literally the stationary fucking object is the thing that causes so many problems.
[80:10.62]Oh my god, the Xbox controller.
[80:12.48]I'm going to beat it up.
[80:19.43]This thing sucks though.
[80:21.23]I'm going to be real honest.
[80:22.31]I was supposed to get the other controller set up, but I just didn't do it.
[80:59.35]Oh!
[80:59.83]God damn it!
[81:02.25]Why?
[81:03.37]I just let it happen.
[81:14.62]Oh my god.
[81:15.62]It's just slowing the game down.
[81:17.26]When you gotta like... I need to go fast!
[81:56.54]You got me right at the end.
[81:57.90]Right at the end you got me?
[82:02.32]Oh my god.
[82:10.09]I did it again!
[82:10.91]I just have to- I don't have to dash!
[82:17.91]Oh.
[82:18.59]Oh.
[82:19.13]My.
[82:19.83]God.
[82:20.17]Kim would be done with this sequence already.
[82:28.71]Oh my fucking Jesus!
[82:30.85]No!
[82:31.99]Oh, what the fuck?
[82:43.46]Oh my god.
[82:44.62]You gotta launch off of it.
[83:00.14]What the fuck?
[83:01.52]I always follow you down!
[83:03.54]Alright.
[83:04.86]You always follow the direction that she goes.
[83:06.76]She like goes down or goes right.
[83:08.66]And this time it's just spikes.
[83:14.67]That's the first time that you've gone in the same direction where you couldn't go.
[83:26.94]Oh my fucking Jesus, there's even more of this shit!
[83:31.83]It doesn't end.
[83:34.54]I feel like I'm in a dream.
[83:37.08]Maybe that's intentional.
[83:58.07]No, wait, what do I do?
[84:05.68]I did it.
[84:06.00]I win.
[84:06.54]I win the game.
[84:08.16]That was fun.
[84:21.51]Fine.
[84:22.63]You win.
[84:24.63]I guess you don't need me after all.
[84:29.27]If you don't want me to go away, I'll try.
[84:30.97]That's not what I want.
[84:33.33]I need your help more than ever.
[84:35.55]Please, let's work together.
[84:39.82]Work together.
[84:41.56]You're joking, right?
[84:47.36]It's okay to be scared.
[84:59.60]A selfie?
[85:00.32]Oh.
[85:21.78]I leveled up.
[85:22.24]What does that mean?
[85:25.34]I can dash.
[85:26.04]I can dash twice now.
[85:28.79]They gave me the double jump that I so wanted so badly.
[85:38.02]Perfectly balanced.
[85:40.10]Like all things should be.
[86:00.43]Just testing it out.
[86:07.47]I'll try to climb the mountain one more time.
[86:10.01]Okay.
[86:14.67]Wait, I thought... Oh.
[86:25.60]How did we do that?
[86:27.20]If we can climb like that, maybe we can still reach the summit.
[86:30.22]Before dinner!
[86:30.90]That's what you should have said.
[86:31.78]You still want to climb the mountain.
[86:33.10]Why would we go back up there?
[86:39.06]It's good to see you two playing nice.
[86:41.20]Hey, thanks for talking some sense into me earlier.
[86:44.03]Well, that's because I'm you from the future.
[86:47.77]Glad I can still be useful every now and then.
[86:51.11]John?
[86:55.77]John, you're okay!
[86:58.89]I ran down to help, but it looks like you're doing fine.
[87:02.38]Thanks, Theo.
[87:05.84]Honestly, maybe that fall was what I needed.
[87:10.28]Is this the part of you that you were talking about?
[87:12.86]She's like an adorable goth John.
[87:14.58]Hi.
[87:20.02]You were right, Theo.
[87:22.46]I shouldn't be afraid of her.
[87:26.81]Gough John.
[87:31.40]If her and I work together, I think we can still finish the climb.
[87:36.54]That's so rad.
[87:39.06]Wait, no.
[87:40.12]I didn't agree to this.
[87:43.16]You said we talk about things first.
[87:45.61]You're right.
[87:46.55]I understand that you're scared, but we both know that this is something we want to do.
[87:50.49]We have to try one last time.
[87:54.81]That's the worst character.
[87:56.15]I don't know.
[87:56.93]We were so close and then we fell.
[88:01.43]The mountain, a.k.a.
[88:04.27]the forest, tore us apart.
[88:08.58]Yeah, that happened.
[88:12.00]But I have to believe we can put that behind us.
[88:17.44]I have to believe we're capable of this.
[88:21.08]It's not a bad idea.
[88:23.83]It'll still be difficult, mind you.
[88:25.71]But I'm amazed you got as far as you did, butting heads like you were.
[88:29.74]I reckon you can make it if you cooperate.
[88:32.82]But please, add me too.
[88:35.64]And get a triple jump!
[88:39.10]Okay, I'll try.
[88:42.28]Can I help?
[88:42.84]You've already done so much for me.
[88:48.51]Let me hold your bag, at least.
[88:53.50]This won't take long.
[88:55.62]We're gonna get the rock music theme of the main theme on the last level.
[89:17.64]Less than a hundred.
[89:18.84]And I got a B-side.
[89:25.03]There's the top.
[89:27.29]I made it to the top of the mountain.
[89:29.71]But all will be revealed.
[89:34.62]That.
[89:37.92]Actually, I think I see where they're going here.
[89:41.18]We'll find out.
[89:46.68]The summit.
[89:56.12]Here it comes.
[89:56.50]Gonna go... Here comes the electric guitar, watch!
[90:07.75]Come on, do it!
[90:09.27]Here it comes!
[90:12.67]Here it comes!
[90:15.85]Do it!
[90:16.49]It's building so much.
[90:21.49]Eh!
[90:40.66]It's a piano.
[90:42.92]It's not an electric guitar.
[90:48.09]Wait, what am I doing?
[91:07.94]I was hoping for like a... No.
[91:10.10]No, wait, hold on.
[91:35.89]Secret?
[91:37.29]I knew it.
[91:37.97]And there's a couple of them.
[91:40.03]Oh.
[92:02.88]Nah, that's it.
[92:03.46]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[92:12.25]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[92:16.79]I had it the first fucking time.
[92:17.99]I had it the first goddamn time!
[92:22.45]I had it!
[92:22.87]I just had to go left once.
[92:24.57]I did it.
[92:41.46]So I need to get that.
[92:42.22]Hold on a second here.
[92:44.95]Okay, I get it.
[92:45.47]So go left, up left.
[92:48.85]If the Xbox controller wasn't the worst human invention.
[92:55.14]I mean, we're talking about number one worst invention ever in the history of humanity.
[93:34.84]I mean, this is worse than the Coffee Maker.
[93:40.78]Pretty bad invention.
[93:51.51]Whoa, wait, I thought we'd fly up.
[93:54.81]Things get clogged in like fucking two months.
[93:58.68]Everyone's like, what are you talking about?
[93:59.60]Coffee maker.
[94:00.16]Use a coffee maker for a month.
[94:01.70]And then guess what?
[94:02.84]You gotta fucking put vinegar in the damn thing.
[94:17.63]Do you not change the filter?
[94:19.18]That's in the instructional booklet.
[94:22.02]We're getting the hang of it, if you say so.
[94:25.24]I missed a secret.
[94:26.36]Well, sometimes you get secrets missed.
[94:36.99]Stop jinxing it.
[94:42.04]Yeah, I'm talking about the clean... You don't... I'm not talking about you putting vinegar in the coffee maker to make coffee.
[94:50.96]I'm talking about when you clean it.
[94:54.30]What?
[94:59.35]And then the coffee for the rest of all time tastes just awful.
[95:06.53]Like salad dressing.
[95:07.56]Your coffee tastes like salad dressing after you clean it.
[95:09.70]I need to look at this.
[95:16.85]Why would you do that?
[95:19.71]I would like everybody in the chat right now to type in coffee maker cleaning, clean cycle vinegar.
[95:29.01]It is in the instructional manual.
[95:33.25]Do it.
[95:56.62]I'm telling everybody that you drank vinegar coffee.
[95:59.26]Don't you dare do that.
[96:00.20]Oh, no you did.
[96:01.45]Alright, this looks, uh, kind of elaborate, so let me see.
[96:06.89]Jump up?
[96:08.12]Uh, let's just go for it.
[96:09.02]Forget it.
[96:29.89]I guess I could go this way.
[96:33.40]What, do I miss out on something by not going that way?
[96:36.22]What's the point of going up there?
[96:38.30]Secret or something?
[96:41.07]I guess I'll try it.
[96:53.08]French press is a thing?
[96:55.80]I don't know, I'm just... I'm just talking nonsense, don't worry guys.
[97:05.26]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[97:07.62]Time to pay attention.
[97:09.78]I have to pee too.
[97:10.40]Has it been two hours?
[97:11.22]Because that's when I go to the bathroom every single time.
[97:20.19]No, wrong thing.
[97:23.17]I don't know.
[97:23.53]Okay, I swear to God.
[97:24.63]There's something wrong with my body.
[97:26.36]It absolutely has to be.
[97:28.92]I have to pee every two hours.
[97:30.00]Is something wrong with me?
[97:31.72]Are you doctors in here?
[97:34.88]Seriously.
[97:35.18]It's because you're drinking too much vinegar.
[97:48.70]Dammit.
[97:48.86]Just trying to jump over it.
[97:49.46]Why won't it activate now?
[97:50.04]Like, activate!
[97:50.50]What the hell are you doing?
[97:51.16]I'm gonna scream.
[97:51.50]This is not even necessary.
[97:52.04]I just have to activate the thing, and then jump over it.
[97:53.04]Why won't it activate now? Like, activate. What the hell are you doing?
[97:57.04]I'm gonna scream. This is not even necessary.
[98:01.40]I just have to activate the thing and then jump over it.
[98:04.40]Like tha- ah oh my god!
[98:13.48]Good diagonal jump.
[98:15.84]X-Box.
[98:17.67]He's starting to... I'm getting mad at circumstantial things.
[98:21.29]Not in the game.
[98:21.87]There's nothing new in the game.
[98:29.76]You guys are kidding me.
[98:46.82]Got it.
[98:47.52]Good.
[98:47.88]Go.
[98:48.35]Let's take a look.
[98:49.37]There's the secret berry.
[98:52.63]Got it.
[98:53.13]Sick.
[99:17.36]Sick.
[99:18.67]Hmm.
[99:22.59]No, that's not right.
[99:30.15]Am I beach ready?
[99:32.76]Probably not.
[99:35.22]No, definitely not.
[99:36.06]Why are you asking me that question?
[99:47.92]I couldn't just grab the edge, shit.
[99:56.93]I'm never gonna have a beach-ready body.
[99:58.67]Is it like a thing, is it a meme or something now?
[100:03.49]Why did I say it out loud?
[100:05.95]I'm insane.
[100:09.35]Oh my god, I gotta pee.
[100:24.05]What, JeremyFy, what are you thinking?
[100:25.77]Why are you doing this?
[100:27.81]Oh, I'm gonna say something disgusting in a second if I'm not careful.
[100:34.15]I'm gonna say, like, pee.
[100:45.54]I'm gonna say something horrible about piss.
[100:49.55]I was gonna be like, I don't even care, I'm gonna pee right into the ground.
[100:51.75]I was gonna say something fucked up like that.
[100:58.80]Uh oh, I'm dead.
[101:01.58]Come on, I can get through that without dashing, can't I?
[101:28.57]No P until victory?
[101:29.63]I already made that video.
[101:31.13]Oh.
[101:31.79]Well that works too.
[101:33.88]Doesn't it?
[101:37.64]Cool.
[102:08.51]Hydrant?
[102:10.51]Nothing?
[102:10.77]Doesn't do anything?
[102:15.31]How much time is left on the piss timer?
[102:19.67]Well, it's almost been two hours, so give or take 15 minutes?
[102:26.10]That's why I gravitated towards the hydrant probably, right?
[102:28.26]How are you feeling?
[102:31.56]I'm fine.
[102:32.38]I'm just waiting for something to go wrong.
[102:36.29]What's going on?
[102:36.73]We're getting a lot of timeouts here.
[102:38.55]What are you guys, misbehaving?
[102:42.28]No matter what happens, I'll be right here with you.
[102:47.74]You know what's really scary?
[102:48.66]I'm starting to believe you.
[102:53.85]One thousand meters.
[103:12.21]Oh, ding dong!
[103:13.52]First try!
[104:02.72]I'm making this harder on myself than I need to.
[104:04.28]That was easy.
[104:07.50]Oh, shit.
[104:12.15]Nice job, Xbox.
[104:24.63]I wanted to go up.
[104:27.74]Relax!
[104:28.44]RELAX!
[104:29.22]I don't know what to do.
[104:39.08]I know what to do.
[104:40.00]I'm gonna go through and then around again.
[105:16.89]I don't want to miss anything.
[105:19.33]Probably already missed a ton of shit.
[105:26.92]Nope!
[105:27.40]Nope!
[105:28.82]Can I stand on something?
[105:41.00]Nothing up here.
[105:41.52]Interesting.
[105:53.49]No!
[105:54.43]What am I doing?
[105:55.23]I got it.
[106:03.63]I'm gonna go the other way.
[106:08.12]No, your like, shitty, crusty muscle memory is not this way.
[106:11.52]Go the other way, the way you were going before.
[106:27.60]Okay, I'll give it a shot.
[106:32.04]I won't.
[106:41.28]I got the right idea.
[106:49.77]Now we gotta go down.
[107:21.91]complete the game with a rock band guitar?
[107:23.77]I don't think I can do that.
[107:28.51]Sorry, this point.
[107:33.93]I'm not sure it would be possible for me to rock band this point.
[107:42.19]Secret?
[107:43.95]No.
[107:45.51]Whoops.
[107:46.59]Ah.
[107:48.41]Well.
[107:50.33]That's the proof right there that the rock band controller is not fucking very good.
[107:54.99]Saw that.
[107:55.31]We watched it happen.
[108:12.51]Complain about the controller.
[108:13.77]Alright, I'm gonna stop.
[108:15.41]I'm gonna stop complaining about the controller because at the end of the day, I'm the one that's operating it.
[108:19.79]I'm the one that's driving the car.
[108:21.11]So, you know what I mean?
[108:23.89]Get a different steering wheel.
[108:25.79]Rip it out, just get a screwdriver, take it out, and just order one from Amazon.
[108:29.16]And put it back in.
[108:34.70]Ms.
[108:35.14]Positivity over here.
[108:37.98]You're so supportive.
[108:41.38]Don't push your luck.
[108:46.24]Fifteen hundred meters.
[108:50.30]No, I can get that stronger.
[108:54.53]Ten minutes till I'm gonna pee my pants.
[108:59.53]Ah, what are you thinking?
[109:00.31]You could have waited.
[109:03.74]You could have... grab the ledge.
[109:06.12]Why do I keep forgetting that's a possibility?
[109:07.54]Too much meat, boy.
[109:09.12]I'm telling you.
[109:21.66]appears it's the Pessus Cosmos I just got like electrocuted every muscle in my body just went like
[109:53.00]I'm just trying to go too fast, you can't do that in this game You have to just do it when it's right Fucking controller controller Not about who's operating it, it's having a bad car
[110:32.25]I hate this car.
[110:47.80]Oh, I hate- oh, stop.
[110:50.93]Have we found- have we found the one strawberry in the game that's that's gonna make me, like, rage quit the whole game?
[110:55.81]And it's the- it's arguably the easiest one of them in the ENTIRE game.
[110:59.63]In the WHOLE game.
[111:45.19]Well, that's not correct.
[111:46.89]Oh, how do I get that one?
[112:21.22]I hate this shit.
[112:22.76]I hate the like fucking moving little thumb things.
[112:25.72]I just want, I don't want to do this one.
[112:28.40]Somebody
[112:50.67]I tried to go up to the right.
[112:51.96]I tried as hard as I could.
[112:58.34]And I tried it again.
[112:59.70]Oh my god.
[113:00.58]I swear I swear to you.
[113:03.63]I swear to you.
[113:04.43]I'm about to go rip this fucking thing out and put in a fucking regular Nintendo controller for all I care.
[113:17.38]What?
[113:17.62]Oh.
[113:31.17]That's what you guys do.
[113:43.17]No, Jeremy!
[114:09.66]I just had to jump, but I forgot what was over there!
[114:12.68]It's alright, I'm fine.
[114:43.03]Quack, quack, quack, quack!
[114:45.38]Quack, quack, quack, quack!
[114:48.66]Quack, quack
[115:12.35]What am I thinking here?
[115:16.23]That's what I'm thinking.
[115:32.90]Oh my god, I had it.
[115:33.94]I was at the end.
[115:34.60]That was the very end.
[115:35.48]We gotta deal with all these dumb things, and this dumb world, and this dumb thing.
[115:42.60]I can't wait.
[115:43.28]This dumb world, dumb stuff, dumb.
[115:45.34]Everything's dumb.
[115:46.06]Nothing is smart.
[115:46.74]Everything's dumb.
[115:47.72]I'm the smart one.
[115:48.62]Nothing else.
[115:49.24]I'm the one that's smart.
[116:01.40]Please.
[116:01.72]Okay.
[116:17.05]You're gonna come up right there, these stupid Mario fireballs.
[116:25.43]No, I had it the first time.
[116:27.09]These stupid fucking... I hate these things.
[116:28.77]I hate this car.
[116:31.95]I love the road.
[117:12.04]I gotta play in one minute.
[117:13.00]I gotta complete the whole game in a minute.
[117:22.07]I see a secret over there.
[117:31.85]The fact that those stupid- the thing grow- you can't stand on these for more than a second.
[117:35.87]So how do you time?
[117:39.22]Again!
[117:44.61]I have to just sit here.
[117:45.35]And go at the right time.
[117:47.70]Which is right now.
[117:49.16]It would have been right now.
[117:51.18]And that would have been right now.
[118:21.00]That's a diamond!
[118:21.75]What does it do?
[118:34.05]What does it do?
[118:40.56]I guess I got it, apparently.
[118:51.17]Holy shit, I almost just fell off a whole world.
[118:53.13]Okay, we're fine.
[119:05.13]What's left?
[119:05.57]Over here, a point.
[119:32.78]Whoops.
[119:41.91]How do I get that to move?
[119:51.95]Can I get that to move?
[120:05.62]I always feel like that should, not should, but my brain, because I see the little beam go all the way up, and I feel like I'm going up there too, but I'm not.
[120:17.61]Check your pants.
[120:18.29]Why would I check my pants?
[120:21.61]Oh god, what happened?
[120:25.03]Does pee all over me?
[120:25.91]What happened?
[120:28.13]It's two hours and one minute.
[120:29.45]God damn it.
[120:30.19]You gotta be kidding me.
[120:34.11]peed my fucking pants.

[123:49.71]I got two jumps.
[123:50.49]So then this, where do you go from here?

[124:51.51]You don't know what restaurant I'm talking about.
[124:53.17]I could eat McDonald's every day.
[124:57.01]And I would still be eating out every night.
[125:14.40]I hope Mr. Oshiro is okay.
[125:17.65]Why?
[125:17.91]He treated you like... Garbage!
[125:21.11]Yeah, but I still care about him.
[125:22.67]And you didn't have to sss... snap at him like that.
[125:27.25]Whatever.
[125:29.74]I mean it, you're way too aggressive.
[125:33.32]Well, you put too much energy into bad people who will just end up hurting you.
[125:38.56]Mr. Oshiro isn't a bad person.
[125:41.14]He transformed into a monster!
[125:43.53]He tried to hurt you!
[125:44.89]And now you're defending him?
[125:47.85]I'm not defending him.

[127:05.22]Whatever.
[127:05.54]Missed it.
[127:06.66]There's probably a secret over here!
[127:13.70]No, this is purple.
[127:19.66]Oh, shit!
[127:24.40]Uh-oh.
[127:26.78]Uh-oh.
[127:31.82]Secret, right?
[127:53.69]Up and down.
[127:59.23]I'm not doing that right.
[128:02.14]From there... What do I do?
[128:06.38]I think I have to fall?
[128:08.40]Cross.
[128:08.94]Up.
[128:09.20]No!

[128:17.01]I'm gonna... You have to fall.
[128:33.46]Really?
[128:34.64]I'm trying to think.
[128:39.85]So if you go across, you're going to go across and then up, and then jump, jump, jump.
[128:44.51]The question is how.
[128:46.39]I'm just going to do that on the other side.
[129:04.94]You're close!
[129:05.96]You're really close!
[129:09.41]Close!
[129:10.17]You're really close!
[129:13.23]Is that what you guys are doing right now?
[129:19.26]I thought you guys were telling me that I was really close, but you're just doing the really close thing.
[129:32.67]I'm so far.
[129:33.71]Ah, I guess do the jump correctly!
[129:36.35]I don't understand.
[129:44.59]There's one thing I'm doing wrong.
[129:56.92]I just don't know what it is.
[130:01.72]That's it.
[130:02.23]I got it.
[130:02.67]That's it.
[130:03.05]That's gonna be the one.
[130:03.79]That's it.
[130:04.59]Watch this.
[130:07.37]You're gonna fall.
[130:17.30]Mwah!
[130:33.29]That was so close.
[130:34.55]That was so close.
[130:35.53]I'm gonna be stuck here for a while.
[130:37.47]Just trying to do this one dumb jump.
[130:45.38]And there it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[130:47.06]There it is.
[130:49.34]He got it!
[130:49.76]Got the secret gem.
[131:06.87]No, I did.
[131:07.51]No, I did, actually.
[131:09.34]I did.
[131:12.08]I did.
[131:14.36]Can I go up?
[131:16.34]I just came from up.
[131:17.64]Jeremy, what are you talking about?
[131:22.24]No, me?
[131:22.94]No, me.
[131:26.19]Are you serious?
[131:30.61]No, I did that.
[131:32.69]It was me.
[131:50.15]How is Utah?
[131:51.95]It's pretty nice.
[132:07.66]Wrong, it was me, actually.
[132:11.42]Don't test my patience.
[132:15.24]Alright, can't see, so...
[132:21.77]Back into the bubble.
[132:29.31]No!
[132:50.09]I don't understand.
[132:50.89]What?
[133:00.21]No, I gotta go forward.
[133:12.53]Oh my god.
[133:13.37]It doesn't matter how many times you press the button.
[133:16.09]It doesn't matter how many times you complain about it.
[133:17.46]You're either gonna fix it, or just deal with it.
[133:22.46]And that's the last straw.
[133:27.79]I was trying to go right twice.
[133:48.77]Mad because glad.
[133:49.79]Mad because bad.
[133:50.77]Mad because sad.
[133:51.71]Sad because bad.
[133:52.69]Sad because mad.
[133:53.69]Mad because glad.
[134:06.08]Oh shit.
[134:12.08]Perfect timing, really.
[134:13.49]This Bullet Bill motherfucker over here.
[134:20.09]I'm gonna be done.
[134:22.49]Mad, because bad.
[134:23.45]Mad, because bad.
[134:24.43]Mad, because bad.
[134:25.50]Mad, because bad.
[134:37.95]But after all, that wasn't snow, that was spikes.
[134:40.13]I thought it was snow.
[134:41.47]Mad, because bad.
[134:42.39]Mad, because bad.
[134:52.13]MAD BECAUSE BAD!
[134:53.01]MAD BECAUSE BAD!
[135:03.66]Oh, come on!
[135:19.12]Holy shit, grab the edge!
[135:24.43]Stopped laughing and beat the level.
[135:26.63]I just did something incredible and I spent the time laughing Instead of doing the thing I was supposed to do You gotta be kidding me I was taunting the game You know, I'm just not so sure what I gotta just jump
[135:58.82]GG, idiot.
[135:59.62]Mastika's back.
[136:07.08]Bad at the game.
[136:08.04]Bad at the game.
[136:08.98]Bad at the game.
[136:09.90]Bad at the game.
[136:12.81]I'm trying to pull it to the left.
[136:14.35]Apparently not.
[136:26.38]Don't even need this dumb thing.
[136:28.34]For what?
[136:31.16]That thing is just not gonna work.
[136:33.52]Oh, that's why I need it.
[136:35.14]How do I do that?
[136:36.15]What?
[136:50.98]What?
[136:56.25]I can't move it?
[137:29.58]I could drag this thing across the whole damn level.
[137:42.30]I tried to jump off of it.
[137:43.16]It wouldn't let me go.
[137:44.06]Let me go!
[137:57.21]Oh my god!
[137:57.95]Get it!
[137:59.15]Okay, I understand.
[138:00.81]That's a wall.
[138:01.43]It can go through that.
[138:17.51]Jeremy, what happened to you?
[138:19.07]I'm fine.
[138:20.03]Bad, because bad.
[138:20.89]Bad, because bad.
[138:31.07]Fuck the berry.
[138:31.89]Nooo.
[138:41.84]Fuck the berry.
[138:46.64]I'm sorry, guys.
[138:47.54]Sometimes you have to take a, uh... You can't get them all in the first round.
[139:00.01]I can get that one though, can't I?
[139:01.70]No dashing.
[139:25.48]You're mad because you're bad.
[139:27.52]Got it.
[139:29.18]Nobody can say that ever again.
[139:47.47]I like this.
[139:47.79]This is a good song.
[139:48.37]For some reason I thought that was a secret.
[139:58.19]Thinking of secrets.
[140:04.85]I saw the berry and it threw me off.
[140:19.59]Bingo.
[140:20.41]There's a secret back here, I know there is.
[140:22.85]Too late.
[140:28.80]Did you start me on the other side?
[140:34.83]No.
[140:35.15]Too late.
[140:36.07]Uh-oh!
[140:45.87]It's fine.
[140:53.10]What are you thinking?
[140:55.72]Oh, what are we thinking here?
[141:25.79]That was a close one.
[141:31.96]Yeah, I wasn't sure if we'd make it.
[141:34.88]Maybe you were right.
[141:36.00]Maybe this is too dangerous.
[141:38.79]No.
[141:40.09]I was wrong.
[141:41.91]We can climb this mountain.
[141:44.51]I got you back.
[141:45.99]And I believe in you.
[141:49.65]That means a lot to me.
[141:54.87]Mad because bad.
[141:55.99]Bad because sad.
[141:57.03]Sad because glad.
[141:58.19]Glad because good.
[141:59.35]Good because glad.
[142:02.19]Thrilled because skilled.
[142:03.81]That's the end.
[142:04.93]Yep, you guys got it right.
[142:13.72]No, not so fast.
[142:14.60]Wait, wait, wait.
[142:18.88]What's over here?
[142:19.50]Anything?
[142:19.94]Nothing at all?
[142:21.14]Don't count that as a death.
[142:22.02]If you do, then I will be very upset about it.
[142:34.33]It's that easy.
[142:42.95]Well, that's... I lean into the microphone when I... I don't know why.
[142:49.92]It's almost like I'm trying to make sure you guys are aware of how... What am I doing?
[143:03.66]You gotta go.
[143:05.36]Hmm.
[143:06.34]Okay.
[143:06.90]I think... Let me think here.
[143:08.22]It seems like... Right from the edge, maybe?
[143:14.85]Maybe.
[143:20.19]Hmm.
[143:24.03]I just grabbed on.
[143:26.19]What if I start from back here?
[143:36.53]That's it.
[143:36.99]I got it.
[143:50.18]Stop!
[143:50.46]What are you doing?
[143:51.78]Please, Xbox!
[143:55.78]I...
[144:43.54]I'm looking over a chat and I'm seeing I'm seeing things that I don't know and I'm looking at it again I got the treasure map
[145:10.33]Look, okay, let me show this one more time.
[145:13.01]I can do it my dumb way, but how am I supposed to know there's a bubble over here?
[145:17.01]You know what I mean?
[145:21.01]This is like, I'm cheating!
[145:43.22]Hold on.
[145:44.86]Alright, okay, okay.
[145:45.60]I did it right.
[145:53.03]What have I grabbed from here?
[145:57.95]Holy shit!
[146:00.41]I thought I had it.
[146:06.65]Hmm.
[146:07.27]I got the first part of this right, but not the second part.
[146:19.04]Hmm.
[146:21.26]Okay, now I get it.
[146:21.94]I get to jump.
[146:25.10]You just jump, you don't dash.
[146:29.13]I almost read it.
[146:29.93]I almost said it.
[146:30.49]You almost got me to say the word that I don't want to say.
[146:35.29]Fuck you, Xbox.
[146:35.81]Shit.
[146:36.17]No, no!
[146:51.63]See, look, I did it.
[146:52.53]Look, I did the thing that everyone told me to do.
[146:58.03]I did the thing.
[146:59.77]The thing that I did not know existed.
[147:01.65]And now I skipped the whole level.
[147:12.06]Cheater.
[147:18.44]Okay, is it cheating?
[147:20.94]If everybody screams at you to cheat.
[147:23.88]I guess it is still cheating, isn't it?
[147:35.19]One guy?
[147:35.63]No fucking way.
[147:36.95]Not in a trillion years was that one guy.
[147:39.17]That was like 200 guys.
[147:39.90]I don't have enough juice.
[147:42.96]That was more than that.
[147:46.14]That was a thousand people.
[147:55.14]I gotta stop using those jumps.
[147:59.53]Ah.
[148:01.65]Dude.
[148:07.27]I'm gonna pull this fucking analog off the flyers.
[148:27.04]Oh Another berry and a key Um I think I have to go down
[148:59.58]Oh my goodness.
[149:00.52]Hold on.
[149:00.94]I need to... Let's go up here first.
[149:06.81]What's on the right side?
[149:08.15]I gotta go like this.
[149:15.65]No, I don't have to go like that.
[149:20.58]I believe these are gonna open eventually.
[149:39.15]Oh boy, okay.
[149:54.08]Here's the key.
[149:54.46]What's the counting for?
[149:55.46]What are you guys counting for right now?
[149:58.12]Oops.
[150:11.86]You guys ain't sick of that yet.
[150:16.86]What's the meme?
[150:18.56]How long does it take?
[150:19.54]Like seven years for a meme to go away?
[150:21.51]Eight years?
[150:22.63]A decade?
[150:23.57]What's the meme?
[150:25.47]When is a meme no longer a meme?
[150:26.95]After like ten years?
[150:38.84]I'm going to hug the left wall.
[150:46.09]Wow.
[150:47.37]I'm kind of freaking out right now.
[150:48.97]That threw me off.
[151:05.82]Alright, got it.
[151:07.78]That's it.
[151:09.42]So now I got the key to the door.
[151:10.58]Let's open the door.
[151:12.52]Wait, not yet.
[151:14.26]That's it.
[151:15.18]Anything else at the bottom here?
[151:17.72]Nothing.
[151:21.85]Hey, Sonny, what's a PogChamp?
[151:24.15]Well, Grandpa.
[151:26.21]PogChamp is when something is cool on the screen and you thought it was really high quality.
[151:32.09]It's a way to say, hey, that was high quality.
[151:47.21]That was an interesting Xbox
[152:23.85]Input's not even happening anymore.
[152:31.24]It's like the controller is getting worse.
[152:36.32]Design a new controller.
[152:40.30]Sure.
[152:43.41]Let's... Let me show you the ideal controller.
[152:49.35]This is what we should be using.
[152:52.31]I'm gonna go over all this bullshit right now, because it needs to be done.
[152:55.85]Give me a second.
[153:10.34]Is this gonna be the urinal?
[153:11.34]No, it's not.
[153:11.74]It's gonna take not even five minutes.
[153:23.64]Okay.
[153:24.50]So... Let's design the perfect controller.
[153:28.62]Because, man... Like, really, is it really that hard?
[153:36.05]Here you go.
[153:43.86]So, here we go.
[153:44.94]Let's get the grip right.
[153:46.96]Best grip that was ever invented was the Nintendo 64 grip.
[153:51.74]That gives you two different grips to work with.
[153:54.96]But I'm of the opinion, right?
[153:57.20]So here you go.
[153:58.44]You got this here, which leads up to down here.
[154:01.14]A lot of space in between.
[154:03.38]You see what I'm saying?
[154:06.78]So when you grab under here, you can wrap your hand around the whole thing.
[154:11.09]Your fingers can wrap around.
[154:13.25]This comes up, like here.
[154:18.19]There's your base of the controller.
[154:20.45]The first analog is here.
[154:24.57]perfect spot and it's make it a little bit smaller right but have the divots here so you can actually move it around and it doesn't get stuck anywhere you know have it have a little well like a moat right so there's analog down here two buttons these are your extra remappable buttons if you want to play it on pc okay
[154:54.26]Because this, by the way, this controller should work across all systems, because this is the main system controller.
[155:00.96]Right in the middle, one huge button here, because if you're holding it with two hands, you've got your left hand here and your right hand here.
[155:09.97]Huge button.
[155:12.15]Big enough where you're not going to miss it, and that would be jump on most fucking computer games.
[155:18.48]Here.
[155:19.77]Here.
[155:20.99]Here.
[155:22.11]And here.
[155:23.81]Across the top.
[155:24.73]These are like L and R, right?
[155:27.43]So this is L1, L2, R1, R2.
[155:31.25]All these can be mapped, by the way.
[155:32.62]Just in case you're curious.
[155:33.56]Trigger over here.
[155:34.98]Trigger over here.
[155:36.20]Trigger over here.
[155:37.00]Trigger over here.
[155:38.64]So you got two triggers.
[155:39.62]This would be L3, L4, L5, L6.
[155:40.78]I mean R5, R6.
[155:42.14]Right?
[155:42.66]Right?
[155:58.55]Space that enough where you can know where they are.
[156:00.99]This would be A, B, no, this would be A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. Okay?
[156:19.46]And the reason why this is like this is because, maybe you've got analog here, big A button here, right analog right here.
[156:28.72]This is the other analog.
[156:32.28]This controller, what you're looking at right now, can be held in any direction.
[156:37.32]You can hold this and use EFG.
[156:40.25]See what I'm saying?
[156:41.79]You can have your hand down here.
[156:43.53]EFG, if you're more comfortable with a higher grip.
[156:45.53]Put another analog right here.
[156:47.19]Right?
[156:49.79]This is called the uniform every controller.
[156:54.74]Where's the D-pad?
[156:57.26]Uh...
[156:59.44]It's all about grip right now, okay?
[157:01.22]Because you can hold it on an edge, like your fingers can come up here.
[157:04.84]Around this way.
[157:06.84]Grab that way.
[157:07.66]Or you can have your thumb here.
[157:09.22]And these can be mapped.
[157:10.16]So you could not even use this controller, this part here.
[157:13.02]And use these.
[157:13.82]Depending on how much you care about the grip.
[157:20.45]Okay, now let's make the real one.
[157:26.49]It's going to take way too long.
[157:32.22]Here you go.
[157:41.26]Grips.
[157:42.61]Actual finger grips on the sides.
[157:46.25]Analog one.
[157:48.69]Analog two.
[157:51.35]Not too close together.
[157:53.91]The PS4 has a problem here where the analogs are here and here.
[157:57.15]They're way too close.
[157:57.73]You can bump your thumbs together if you push them right and left.
[158:03.46]Button 1.
[158:05.14]Button 2.
[158:06.88]Button 3.
[158:08.34]Button 4.
[158:10.78]Start.
[158:11.42]Select.
[158:15.13]Tray.
[158:16.19]That comes down.
[158:18.33]French fries.
[158:19.35]Hamburgers.
[158:20.79]Right?
[158:21.81]Food.
[158:22.23]A drink.
[158:24.07]Here's your lap.
[158:27.09]This is your lap.
[158:33.56]L R French fries Two plugs One plug Into the console Second plug For the lights in your house Here's a lamp
[159:01.84]It's too long to draw a controller.
[159:03.98]The first one was a joke.
[159:04.88]The second one was going to be real, but it was going to take too long.
[159:07.56]It would take too long to design a controller.
[159:08.91]I'm not even making a joke.
[159:11.49]I just didn't want to take that long to do it.
[159:21.52]It was a bar of soap.
[159:38.01]That's such a tiny tray.
[159:41.44]But what you don't realize is that controller was huge.
[159:45.08]That was like a fight stick.
[159:47.20]Oh my god, speaking of controllers, everyone wants to fucking go make one.
[159:59.21]Where was the urinal?
[160:00.85]No, I can't just sit there and draw for like 40 minutes.
[160:19.75]I mean you can yeah I can but I like I'm so close to the end of this game that why would I just spend like 30 minutes right now designing a fake controller uh oh
[160:47.52]I figured it out Take me up.
[160:56.50]Thank you Stupid game.
[161:11.23]No, it's not the game's not stupid.
[161:12.49]Oh
[161:21.04]Right here!
[161:21.88]Trey, right here!
[161:23.78]This, oh, Urinal!
[161:33.02]Okay Made it Yes Up, over Up, up, over Ha, ha!
[161:49.36]That freaked me out
[161:52.66]It was the dumb thing with the... It looks like you fly up higher than you do.
[161:56.32]Alright, I gotta figure this one out.
[162:33.41]Xbox controller.
[162:43.76]I couldn't even do that if I tried on purpose.
[163:04.22]Okay.
[163:05.00]Well.
[163:07.60]He's fuming because booming.
[163:11.74]Alright.
[163:12.18]Come on.
[163:12.68]You're really reaching on that one.
[163:17.26]Come on.
[163:18.14]That's not even a word.
[163:25.16]Again.
[163:25.90]Again.
[163:26.16]You can do it again.
[163:28.86]Shouldn't have done that.
[164:05.29]This is it.
[164:05.83]The home stretch.
[164:06.75]We're so close.
[164:08.18]We're gonna make it.
[164:11.22]Yeah.
[164:14.32]What's wrong?
[164:16.10]I'm just... I'm sorry.
[164:19.46]I was holding you back.
[164:22.92]I need to learn to trust you.
[164:25.00]You must learn.
[164:27.02]It's not your fault.
[164:28.00]I tried to leave you behind.
[164:30.68]And honestly, I've been trying to leave you behind my entire life.
[164:34.14]The controller I talked about is real.
[164:35.96]Thank you.
[164:36.20]How do I get this?
[164:37.48]How do I order this?
[164:38.01]Is this real?
[165:07.47]That looks like somebody mi- I want that.
[165:10.23]Look at how beautiful that is.
[165:11.93]The front one?
[165:12.55]The little, like, Xbox dick?
[165:16.51]You can use that for, like, flight games.
[165:19.88]When you fly.
[165:20.48]That's not real.
[165:26.50]I only made that up for fun.
[165:39.09]Uh, I thought I just crashed the game, thank god.
[165:41.56]I'm glad the mountain brought you up.
[165:46.00]I think we can move past this.
[165:47.38]If we can climb this mountain together, we can do anything.
[165:49.24]What if we don't make it?
[165:53.86]I'd be okay with that.
[165:55.68]You would?
[165:57.56]Of course.
[165:58.22]I'm just glad we're trying.
[165:59.32]I really need to do this.
[166:01.36]I'm finally starting to understand why.
[166:02.93]Let's finish it.
[166:08.57]3,000.
[166:08.59]29!
[166:09.05]Hooray!
[166:09.56]Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. 28!
[166:52.60]Everyone's gonna start fucking counting And I can't stop this shit because it's in the game Wish I could do something about it Spamming a meme from like 2015 Still happening
[167:19.94]I WILL NEVER STOP IT!
[167:36.55]Secret?
[167:37.21]No?
[167:37.45]Nah, it's fine.
[167:44.21]I can hit it.
[167:57.32]I have to get 100 berries.
[168:02.12]I went through it.
[168:02.94]I went through that when I collected it.
[168:15.69]It's been 16 years.
[168:17.71]Since what?
[168:29.68]Oh, you motherfucker, I swear to god, come on.
[168:38.45]Ah, I gotta grab the edge, that's what I'm doing wrong.
[168:48.52]Like that.
[168:51.08]I'm not even, you know, I'm just gonna say, got flagged, because I'm not gonna say the numbers.
[169:12.05]97, 98!
[169:12.11]I need 2 more to get 100.
[169:40.61]Is he putting flags in there?
[169:42.41]Wait, what?
[169:43.10]Is that a flag?
[169:43.78]Oh, it's number one.
[169:52.55]I can get it.
[169:58.03]Boomer vision.
[169:59.64]Activate boomer vision!
[170:18.22]Don't worry.
[170:19.38]When I do the bionic boomer thing, there will be boomer vision.
[170:24.57]Holy shit, I got it.
[170:25.69]Okay.
[170:27.61]And I will activate it, and you will get to see through my eyes.
[170:37.20]One more, and I get 100.
[170:38.06]It's gonna be spooky, yeah?
[170:44.11]Well, okay, I screwed that up.
[170:58.83]Oh.
[170:59.03]Oh, it's the wind.
[171:10.29]I get it.
[171:10.81]The wind is doing this.
[171:30.04]I need another berry.
[171:36.89]That's gonna drive me crazy if I actually don't find one.
[171:39.11]There's one right there.
[171:45.50]Okay, we're good.
[172:01.99]Hold on a second here.
[172:03.65]Where is... Maybe I'm... I think I have to get over there.
[172:16.01]Holy... Charge.
[172:18.19]Do I?
[172:21.78]No, I think I can... Alright, I got a checkpoint, so drop down.
[172:30.70]And...
[172:35.20]One hundred.
[172:37.15]Very good.
[172:45.55]Let's go for 101.
[172:52.34]You're gonna get over that in one jump.
[173:13.95]Reset it.
[173:14.59]Oh, it's because I'm at 101.
[173:20.57]Reset it.
[173:21.33]No.
[173:22.17]You've ruined it.
[173:28.57]I'll get an even number.
[173:32.49]We'll get one, one, one.
[173:38.25]Nothing's safe over there.
[173:45.59]Alright, I think I gotta Damn It looks like it's two is it two jumps hold on to the edge Is this a pre-recorded stream yes I'm, sorry
[174:18.62]Holy shit.
[174:19.22]Alright, you gotta do it to all sides.
[174:34.39]Yeah, I'm recording this.
[174:35.91]It is... August 3rd, 2018.
[174:43.81]I knew I wasn't gonna be able to stream this week, so I made sure to get something up here.
[174:50.52]Oh, shit.
[174:51.51]God, man.
[176:00.13]Yippee!
[176:14.40]Aw.
[176:18.30]Ow.
[176:19.60]My skull.
[176:49.15]A half second.
[177:00.89]This is so precise.
[177:02.97]Goddamn.
[177:16.18]You suck at Fortnite.
[177:17.58]I hope so.
[177:29.08]If I was good at Fortnite, that'd be a real weird problem.
[177:31.48]That'd be strange.
[177:35.54]He sucks at Fortnite.
[177:43.32]This may be one of the hardest jumps in the game.
[178:08.12]Also, by the way, also keep in mind, half of these where I jump into the ceiling is because the... the... Never mind.
[178:20.95]I'm doing it wrong.
[178:25.29]Well, I wanted to go up.
[178:26.49]I wanted to jump up there.
[178:27.33]That would have been great.
[178:29.71]Sorry, I have... I have... Just stop.
[178:32.07]Oh, I'm fucking...
[178:37.83]Can I, like, record myself burning the Xbox One controller?
[178:42.93]And, like, peeing on it?
[178:44.15]Am I going to get in trouble for that?
[178:55.52]Legally, no.
[179:03.20]God damn it.
[179:04.06]Get me out of here.
[179:04.70]There's more.
[179:08.01]Oh, that sucks total ass.
[179:09.29]I can't... I'm gonna pee on this.
[179:10.91]Well, better not go that way.
[179:23.30]I'm done.
[179:24.78]Not like getting... I'm talking about, like, that can't make a jump.
[179:46.02]That's a dash left and then up.
[179:51.21]It sure is.
[180:24.20]Give it here.
[180:24.72]Give it here!
[180:31.52]Six!
[180:33.36]Where do I go?
[180:34.02]Where am I going?
[180:34.71]Up?
[180:37.31]It's always up.
[180:38.13]I gotta get to the top of the mountain.
[180:42.29]Uh oh.
[180:42.65]Uh oh.
[180:43.01]Uh oh.
[180:43.25]Uh oh.
[180:43.45]I got it.
[180:47.53]I wonder where we're supposed to go?
[180:48.61]Climb the mountain, maybe?
[180:49.71]Yeah, I guess I could look.
[181:09.24]Every time I look, it doesn't really help me though.
[181:12.82]Alright, so you gotta go up and around, grab the feather, and then to the right.
[181:18.57]Oh my god, what are you supposed to do there Wow
[181:49.02]You gotta go around the edge?
[181:51.16]Holy shit.
[181:52.56]I would've loved to have gone straight up there.
[182:23.31]I don't think I can get it.
[182:29.43]Nope.
[182:38.35]Wait.
[182:38.63]I think I can get it.
[182:41.45]It's gonna take some precision on my part though.
[182:53.81]And who says you can't fucking get shit done?
[182:55.29]I wanna know their name.
[182:57.51]I wanna know their name.
[183:01.63]Donnie?
[183:02.04]It was Donnie, wasn't it?
[183:11.50]Tell Donnie.
[183:12.04]Bring him up.
[183:23.67]No, that's not gonna help that is Don't call him yet don't call dawn yet don't call donnie
[183:53.80]Because he's going to turn the stream on, he's going to be like, the fuck, you kidding me?
[183:56.94]No, he's not.
[183:57.62]He didn't do it.
[183:58.14]And he's going to load the stream up and he's going to be falling shit.
[184:00.44]Don't call him yet.
[184:01.00]Call him in like 10 minutes.
[184:10.43]Alright, ready?
[184:11.19]Call him now.
[184:14.37]Get him in here.
[184:21.41]Hey, yeah, dude, Jerma's about to beat Celeste.
[184:25.29]Shut the fuck up, stupid.
[184:27.55]There's no way he's gonna do that.
[184:28.79]Okay, yeah, sure.
[184:30.57]I believe you.
[184:31.59]Open the stream, dude, I'm not even kidding.
[184:32.75]He's about to do it.
[184:33.35]Yeah, hey, I'm not gonna... Hold on.
[184:40.84]No way!
[184:42.22]No way!
[184:42.88]He probably cheated.
[184:43.64]He probably, like, you know, I bet he has a save state.
[184:51.61]We actually did it.
[184:52.17]I can't believe it.
[184:56.07]I didn't have a save state.
[184:58.45]Wow, it's so beautiful.
[184:59.35]Look at how far we've come.
[185:04.82]Glad I got to see this before I... Well, before I... Oh, right.
[185:10.80]When we leave the mountain, you won't be able to talk to me anymore.
[185:16.20]I didn't... How did I cheat?
[185:23.11]Because I got a secret item.
[185:27.67]At least not like this.
[185:32.50]Yeah.
[185:33.62]I know that we need to go home eventually.
[185:34.98]But it would be scary to lose his body.
[185:39.23]Beat because cheat.
[185:43.31]You'll still exist, though.
[185:45.11]You were part of me before we came up here.
[185:49.18]Yeah, I know.
[185:52.20]But I'm going to have to depend on you to listen to me, even if I can't talk to you in person anymore.
[185:57.48]I just can't go back to how it was before.
[185:59.42]Before the mountain.
[186:01.98]Don't worry.
[186:02.54]I can't go back to that either.
[186:04.36]I really want us to work together from now on.
[186:07.80]I believe you.
[186:08.61]But I'm still nervous.
[186:14.51]So now what?
[186:17.47]Let's just enjoy this for a bit.
[186:24.57]Selfie.
[186:26.22]Here it comes.
[186:26.62]Oh, this is a video.
[186:30.88]You went into video mode on your DSLR.
[186:35.40]You don't really take a selfie with the DSLR, do you?
[186:38.92]No?
[186:39.73]Not really.
[186:50.01]Is it?
[186:57.97]Did it.
[186:58.59]I climbed the mountain.
[187:01.19]We're not done, though.
[187:01.91]That was a lot of fun.
[187:06.05]Wait, am I going back down?
[187:15.64]That was a challenging, fun platform game.
[187:27.00]Washed up Fortnite streamer.
[187:30.84]Okay, if I was a Fortnite streamer, I wouldn't be washed up because I would be doing the current trend that's currently relevant right now.
[187:39.11]You don't get washed up as a Fortnite streamer when Fortnite is currently still the most popular thing in the world.
[187:46.25]If I was streaming like Minecraft right now, or like Five Nights at Freddy's, maybe.
[188:05.15]That's not what washed up means what will you okay there's washed up and then there's washed up X I Don't even need to explain myself
[188:25.09]Did they ever explain who... Who that guy was?
[188:29.82]Because I understand the whole... Some of the other characters here.
[188:36.00]But who's that guy?
[188:36.64]I know he was like the hotel.
[188:40.66]And he was a ghost.
[188:46.41]But in the story... In like the deeper meaning of the story here.
[188:49.27]Is it just the hotel manager?
[188:52.17]That's just who he was.
[188:59.54]He's just a ghost.
[189:13.39]B-sides, Jex.
[189:14.55]Don't be a normie.
[189:15.99]Oh my god.
[189:16.71]I already did one B-sides.
[189:19.47]I'm gonna do it.
[189:20.73]We're not done.
[189:21.23]I'm going to the B-sides.
[189:22.13]I'm gonna try it.
[189:30.71]But who's the bird?
[189:36.64]Speaking of birds, I don't know why I just... I can't do that.
[189:40.12]I would ruin it.
[189:41.54]Oh, that would be very bad.
[189:44.10]I just had this flash moment in my brain where I was just watching myself on webcam Shito wakes up and is chirping and I go like mush up food in my mouth and like on cam like spit it into his mouth like feeding him I'm glad I didn't do that I was glad that didn't happen
[190:12.78]Like, I'm feeding the baby bird.
[190:16.44]Hey, welcome back!
[190:20.14]John- but then I wouldn't- I can't ruin Cheeto.
[190:22.65]I can't, like, fuck up the toy.
[190:25.19]Did you make it into the summit?
[190:28.83]Yeah, we did.
[190:29.97]It was incredible.
[190:31.97]Beautiful, isn't it?
[190:34.23]I didn't think it would be worth it, but it totally was.
[190:38.37]I should have given you my phone so you could take the ultimate selfie.
[190:43.03]Thought he was going to say YOLO again.
[190:45.83]Good evening, everyone.
[190:48.21]What are you doing here?
[190:49.05]A little bird told me there was going to be a party.
[190:55.26]RSVP by bird.
[190:56.26]Positively magical.
[190:58.46]But if I am unwelcome, I shall take my leave.
[191:01.87]Please stay.
[191:05.03]Mr. Oshiro.
[191:09.19]It's good to see you.
[191:12.51]You know, this is the first time I've seen you outside that hotel of yours, Oshiro.
[191:15.45]I'm glad you made it.
[191:18.47]John here is baking us a pie with all the strawberries she's been collecting.
[191:23.42]Oh, that's what the strawberries are.
[191:25.56]That's wonderful.
[191:27.54]I haven't had strawberry pie since I was a kid.
[191:29.74]This is gonna be amazing.
[191:33.60]Don't get your hopes up, she's not much of a baker.
[191:36.95]He also said I wasn't a mountain climber.
[191:40.13]True.
[191:41.74]Are we at 101 berries?
[191:44.26]I can't promise it'll live up to the hype, Theo, but I tried my best.
[191:49.68]Put him in.
[191:51.28]How's it taste?
[191:56.64]That sounds kinda- looks like it's pretty good.
[192:00.42]I'm impressed.
[192:01.34]This gives my baking a run for its money.
[192:03.12]Good ending.
[192:04.14]Not bad.
[192:05.68]Holy crap, this is so tasty.
[192:09.04]John, are you available to cater our reopening banquet?
[192:13.77]I thought he was going to say, can I take a selfie with it?
[192:18.83]Can I take a selfie?
[192:23.55]He already is taking a selfie with it, though.
[192:25.35]So that already happened.
[192:26.38]That really is too bad that the numbers there are the way they are.
[192:32.58]102 out of 175.
[192:33.72]1373 deaths.
[192:33.90]8 hours and 26 minutes.
[192:34.32]Almost elite status.
[192:45.34]Can we get more likes than the Kardashians on this cake?
[192:49.88]There you go.
[192:52.20]There's the campaign.
[192:58.75]There's an epilogue, though.
[192:59.87]Wait.
[193:00.81]What's this?
[193:02.73]It's been two hours?
[193:03.77]No, it's only been an hour and 15 minutes.
[193:05.19]Why do I have to pee again?
[193:08.21]This is chapter 8, the core.
[193:17.68]About a year later.
[193:27.75]Hey there, kiddo.
[193:29.03]Nice to see you again.
[193:31.39]Here's the cave I told you about on the phone.
[193:34.52]Follow me.
[193:48.62]What happened?
[193:49.56]I wasn't walking out?
[193:50.34]Wait, what's going on here?
[193:52.66]Why don't I have power?
[193:53.44]Okay.
[193:55.58]Strange.
[194:01.88]What is this place?
[194:02.52]How did the lady do this?
[194:03.54]That's right.
[194:04.60]This passage leads to the center of the mountain.
[194:06.84]You said you wanted to come back and explore deeper.
[194:10.21]Doesn't get any deeper than this.
[194:12.83]Be careful, though.
[194:14.47]When you get this close to the heart of the mountain, the power will start affecting you differently.
[194:19.82]Yeah, I already noticed some of that.
[194:22.04]Good luck in there.
[194:24.42]Where's that other part of you?
[194:27.04]I don't know.
[194:28.44]I expect her to show up by now.
[194:31.92]Maybe I've changed and she's not part of me anymore.
[194:34.20]Or maybe you've grown together.
[194:36.58]Maybe it's not so easy for the mountain to separate you now.
[194:39.82]I'd wager she's still with you in some form.
[194:43.58]I like that theory better.
[194:45.20]Still wish I could talk to her, though.
[194:48.92]Alright, bye.
[194:56.97]I'm worthy?
[194:58.91]Oh, I am worthy to go through.
[195:00.39]How does this work?
[195:07.48]Oh, alright.
[195:22.01]Oh, that was clean.
[195:25.31]Beat level in the whole game.
[195:27.95]Oh, best level in the game, is what he said.
[195:29.97]Okay.
[195:30.77]We'll see.
[195:32.19]It does have flying objects, so I don't know if... I might not agree with you.
[195:36.19]Well, that's what that does.
[195:37.19]Oops.
[195:37.29]Alright, I don't know why I keep doing that.
[195:48.92]Get on top.
[195:53.99]Well, that's why.
[195:54.49]Because I have to do it in one jump.
[195:56.05]Because I ran out of juice.
[195:58.84]Don't get refilled.
[196:00.28]Hmm.
[196:22.73]Hmm... Not entirely sure why they're giving that to me, but I'm sure there's a reason.
[196:31.49]Just to go down?
[196:34.01]Hmm, okay.
[196:37.79]Shouldn't be wasting one there.
[196:39.54]Hmm, I guess I can still make it.
[196:55.50]He's left and right.
[196:56.26]Let's see.
[196:56.89]I'm trying to get lucky.
[197:15.04]Alright, let's go left.
[197:23.97]So, am I supposed to... touch it or something?
[197:28.03]Somehow?
[197:28.53]I don't know.
[197:29.39]Can't jump on them.
[197:44.11]It's over here.
[197:47.61]I guess this looks kind of like where I need to be.
[197:50.53]So I gotta jump across... from...
[198:13.13]Ran out of power.
[198:13.95]Whoops.
[198:15.07]Ah.
[198:16.23]Wait, what?
[198:42.84]I think that's... I'm doing it right, I think.
[198:48.08]Okay, I gotta... He's abandoned the solutions.
[198:55.79]What do you mean, abandoned the solutions?
[198:58.65]I can't use the dash here.
[198:59.79]Except I did.
[199:04.19]But I can.
[199:08.07]What about up here?
[199:11.09]The critical information is not accessible to him.
[199:16.18]No, I'm not in assist mode.
[199:23.68]Oh, there's a fire!
[199:28.52]Wait.
[199:29.48]There's a fire.
[199:30.12]Can I turn it off?
[199:39.02]Now it's ice.
[199:42.34]So you go from fire to ice.
[199:44.48]Can I jump on these?
[199:50.56]Yes, you can.
[199:56.70]Now what?
[200:00.96]Uh-oh.
[200:02.86]Oh.
[200:13.70]Yes, who is it?
[200:21.03]Ahhhh, okay.
[200:22.99]Now we go back, and everything's frozen.
[200:28.94]Would you look at that?
[200:32.90]Icy to dull the pain, and then hot to relieve it away.
[200:35.78]Icy hot.
[200:38.11]I see what you're doing over here.
[200:44.09]That was a good, that was a good chat joke.
[200:59.80]Now I can go, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[201:03.65]This is now accessible.
[201:17.01]What a washed up Fortnite streamer.
[201:18.81]I need one more.
[201:31.33]I need to save one.
[201:33.77]And that's how you do it.
[201:43.02]That is how you do it.
[201:51.27]You know what?
[201:52.35]You're really starting to piss me off You're really starting to piss me off
[202:18.91]Don't you dare.
[202:19.65]Don't do this.
[202:20.67]Why have you done this to me?
[202:33.31]I had it.
[202:33.85]I got this.
[202:34.35]I threw this stupid bumper.
[202:35.81]It's alright.
[202:45.83]Not this guy.
[202:48.71]Okay, now I can get up there.
[202:52.47]I think I need to come at it from this angle.
[203:03.09]I gotta break them one by one, I think.
[203:04.71]Unless they come around, maybe?
[203:12.74]Hmm.
[203:17.34]I guess I could just go straight through the middle.
[203:26.70]Alright, there you go.
[203:29.00]Now I can jump off of them.
[203:33.69]Oh, they respawned.
[203:34.95]Just go up!
[203:35.57]I don't need to destroy them all for any reason.
[203:42.27]Just go up.
[203:47.64]Oh, shit.
[204:00.14]Oh!
[204:01.01]Shit, I was right there.
[204:22.95]Stupid video game.
[204:23.79]I didn't even want to grab.
[204:26.91]I wouldn't even hold and grab.
[204:48.11]I'm gonna go from up here and I'm gonna drop down off the top rope.
[204:53.81]I think that's what I need to do.
[204:54.73]Probably not.
[205:10.34]I think I do, actually.
[205:11.16]Let me see.
[205:11.94]Yeah, I definitely do.
[205:15.48]Because then I have to dash.
[205:17.18]I had it.
[205:26.73]No, get off.
[205:32.89]I'm angling as hard as I can to the top right.
[205:45.91]I gotta pee, too.
[205:55.60]Okay.
[205:59.83]Well, now I got this.
[206:01.09]Oh, what the hell?
[206:02.09]I touched the stupid thing on the side.
[206:04.91]Oh, no.
[206:06.25]That's not good.
[206:09.20]It's alright.
[206:21.51]Mad because bad.
[206:22.29]Mad because bad.
[206:31.39]Oh dear.
[206:32.11]You gotta switch it halfway through.
[206:38.46]Yikes.
[206:42.00]Okay.
[206:47.92]I don't even need to use that.
[206:52.61]Oh.
[206:53.91]No.
[206:54.42]There's a secret up there.
[206:59.58]Oh.
[207:02.11]Well, can't get it anyways, can I?
[207:16.49]I read that needle.
[207:17.91]I waited so long.
[207:21.26]Oh well.
[207:39.27]Ah, my fucking hands are slipping with my greasy fucking sweaty hands.
[207:51.75]he's up here alright gonna jump over on the second jump
[208:20.09]Hooray!
[208:22.19]He's got P-coded hands.
[208:23.59]Holy shit.
[208:44.48]Interesting stuff.
[208:45.74]I'm so- I gotta hold the dash here.
[208:53.17]Damn it!
[208:53.87]I blew it again.
[208:54.73]Why am I dashing there?
[209:00.46]I don't think it's even necessary.
[209:02.90]Just die.
[209:09.08]Yes it is.
[209:10.32]I just panicked so hard.
[209:31.23]Nope, he's not gonna do it.
[209:32.11]No, he's not.
[209:44.09]Shit!
[209:44.61]That was right there!
[209:45.97]I had it!
[209:46.59]It was right there!
[209:48.64]Everything went so smooth.
[209:58.03]Nope, I'll keep this down.
[209:59.63]Fucking Xbox 360.
[210:00.55]Thought I could save it.
[210:08.74]Ugh.
[210:36.02]Seriously, how come I can get that sometimes?
[210:37.88]The other half of the time I just can't do it.
[210:43.22]Here we go.
[210:48.52]No, it's not, no.
[210:50.18]How?
[210:51.96]I'm trying to time it, but I just can't do it apparently.
[211:11.72]If I don't get that first jump first try, I'm just falling down.
[211:14.56]Seriously.
[211:34.02]I didn't even fucking mean to do that.
[211:45.28]Holy fuck, what happened?
[211:46.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[211:47.26]I think I can use that.
[211:55.74]What the hell was that?
[211:57.00]Whoa, what?
[211:58.01]Holy shit.
[212:07.91]Timing on some of these.
[212:09.81]It's like, come on, man.
[212:39.46]Okay, hit the bottom right pinball, jump out.
[212:49.26]No, shit.
[212:50.78]What?
[212:54.00]I gotta go pee before I spike this controller into the ground and have it shatter into 10,000 pieces because that's how strong I am.
[213:13.23]I'll be right back
[214:07.67]Thank you.
[214:40.62]Thank you.
[215:23.06]okay let's try this again how much did you pay for annuity of Jeremy I'll give you one for free right now

[216:27.68]What do I do?
[216:29.26]Hold on, hold on, stop!
[216:30.42]Stop moving, everyone stop moving!
[216:32.93]Oh shit!
[216:35.67]Alright.
[216:37.43]How the fuck do I reliably do this?
[216:42.13]The bottom right one is what everyone's screaming.
[216:46.33]But alright, so you're talking about, like, on the way down, bounce off that, okay.
[216:52.24]Oh, my fucking god.
[216:58.20]I just... The stupid slow jump over here.
[217:02.50]It's just... And I just... My god.
[217:05.01]I'm gonna fucking get so angry at this.
[217:09.91]It's like that, like, way jump.
[217:26.72]I don't even want to do that.
[217:28.20]I really don't even want to do that.
[217:38.45]I don't care about this drop.
[217:39.23]Get me out of here.
[217:39.73]I hate that.
[217:40.39]That was the worst thing ever.
[217:52.68]Oh, this is going to be... This is going to be hell.
[218:01.35]Oh, this is going to be hell.
[218:13.06]Give me back!
[218:13.52]Get off me!
[218:14.74]No!
[218:27.08]Strawberry?
[218:27.60]No.
[218:29.64]Fuck the strawberry.
[218:30.36]I'm not getting it.
[218:40.85]Oh, come on.
[218:43.87]You gotta put these stupid fucking pinball machines everywhere.

[220:19.32]Oh god.
[220:30.60]I just gotta go fast.
[220:31.68]I can't just stop.
[220:37.95]I would have had it if I actually dashed right when I pressed the button to do so.
[221:03.48]Sunk the Hedgehog level, that's fine.
[221:04.90]Oh no.
[221:11.91]Ow.
[221:19.95]Oh shit.
[221:29.72]Ice, ice, ice!
[221:30.42]Is that gonna hurt me?
[221:53.75]Too fast.
[221:54.13]I actually might be able to go up.
[221:56.83]But I already used it.
[222:01.06]I didn't want to do that.
[222:22.69]Still going.
[222:33.18]Nope.
[222:42.35]Oh, what a fire!
[222:43.43]Okay.
[222:47.09]What happened?
[222:48.75]Still fire?
[222:49.19]I can't turn it off?
[222:54.50]I didn't know it was up there.
[223:04.55]Come on man, you gotta be kidding me.
[223:36.17]I hate this moving shit.
[223:45.99]I really do.
[223:46.55]I don't have any deuce.
[224:00.26]I can't go anywhere.
[224:14.99]I can't do that!
[224:15.71]I need you!
[224:16.29]Moving shit!
[224:17.55]MOVING SHIT!

[224:42.06]Wait a minute!
[224:43.06]Wait a minute!
[224:43.98]Oh, wait just a minute!
[224:45.36]Wait a minute!
[224:46.40]Oh!
[224:49.48]I gotta start on this side.
[224:53.40]Oh no, that's how you do it with the backhand.
[225:00.13]You do that.
[225:09.52]I thought they were just baiting me.
[225:50.83]not every time I am gonna burn this on spring I'm gonna have a nice fire my backyard and we're gonna burn this controller
[226:17.82]Sometimes it does not work well.
[226:45.34]I think I need bulk dashes too.
[226:47.41]At least, no I don't.
[226:49.19]There's one of those things over there.
[226:54.45]Oh, I'm not getting it right.
[226:55.51]I gotta jump off that into the wall and... God damn.
[227:16.51]Sometimes you just end up doing that.
[227:24.56]He's making it look hard.
[227:27.12]It IS hard.
[227:29.16]How is this not hard?
[227:33.43]You gotta be like a fucking alien to not think this is like a difficult portion of the game.
[227:42.50]You're making this look hard.
[227:43.56]You know, the bonus epilogue chapter.
[227:46.68]That's way past the end of the game.
[227:49.20]In this hard platformer game.
[228:01.99]Every time.
[228:03.62]I gotta get higher.
[228:20.31]Holy fuck, I had it!
[228:21.49]No, that was it!
[228:22.49]Ugh!
[228:24.03]Oh my god.
[228:43.86]Oh my god.
[228:44.34]No, don't do this to me.
[228:45.26]What if it happened?
[228:45.80]What happened?
[228:46.82]Where'd it go?
[228:49.68]Where is it?
[228:52.12]No!
[228:53.64]I would have had it if I didn't dash.
[229:12.88]Oh my god.
[229:14.38]No, don't.
[229:28.28]Do it!
[229:37.39]What do I do here?
[229:38.49]Oh my god!
[229:41.61]Get up there!
[229:42.51]No!
[229:43.18]No!
[229:44.16]No!
[229:44.58]Hit the ice!
[229:45.60]Wait!
[229:46.24]Wait!
[229:46.42]I don't know what to do next!
[229:47.34]Oh, this is half...
[230:16.54]I need a dash.
[230:17.79]I gotta go.
[230:18.53]I have no idea what to do there.
[230:45.94]I'm not sure if I can even get that.
[230:49.52]That's how you do it.
[230:50.37]Oh, man.
[230:50.97]Oh, come on.
[231:06.88]What did I even bump my head on?
[231:07.94]That makes no sense.
[231:17.81]Fuck oh, yeah Bump my head again
[231:45.97]No, I can't climb that.
[231:47.25]I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
[231:52.56]He beat the levels.
[231:53.74]This is getting repetitive.
[231:57.02]I know you guys are just joking around.
[231:59.16]I know you are.
[232:05.28]There's no way.
[232:05.94]This is not a joke.
[232:10.29]You have to be kidding me.
[232:17.06]Okay, here we go.
[232:24.88]Dude, how the fuck was I ever supposed to do that?
[232:27.95]Touch it!
[232:28.61]I win.
[232:34.69]He can't be this bad, can he?
[232:37.01]There's no way he's this bad.
[232:39.15]How can he be this bad?
[232:40.57]He's bad.
[232:41.68]Bad.
[232:42.86]Bad.
[232:51.29]What the hell am I supposed to do here?
[233:10.49]Found it.
[233:16.33]Nooo, they gave you a second.
[233:19.04]And now you go, I'm out of it, I'm out of it.
[233:21.52]Oh no.
[233:25.39]Shit.
[233:30.89]It's gonna, ahhh.
[233:45.11]Come home, you've been playing this game for months.
[233:54.13]I don't even know what's on this screen.
[233:56.09]Oh!
[234:12.26]Oh boy.
[234:13.18]That was not too bad.
[234:16.31]Not terrible.
[234:17.11]It's gonna get way worse though.
[234:22.05]I think I understand.
[234:22.89]I gotta just bounce across the whole thing.
[234:49.92]That blended in with the background.
[234:51.16]That was a shadow.
[234:51.94]That shadow blended in.
[234:53.34]Wasn't he supposed to reach the top of the mountain?
[235:09.84]Hold on!
[235:10.11]Wait!
[235:10.29]That's not... I don't need him!
[235:23.69]Yeah, we already climbed the mountain.
[235:24.85]We're in the heart of the mountain now.
[235:28.79]This is the epilogue level.
[235:36.74]It's a bonus chapter.
[235:39.12]I have to beat this to prove to the one guy in chat that called me a normie.
[236:16.24]I don't even... Holy shit, man.
[236:21.31]I played this level in Aladdin and I hated it just the same.
[236:47.47]What did I bump?
[236:48.35]I'm looking at chat, sorry.
[237:07.54]Oh my god, please.
[237:18.21]Uh-oh.
[237:18.85]Uh-oh.
[237:19.85]Uh-oh!
[237:20.99]That was it right there!
[237:22.27]Oh!
[237:22.33]I just, I'm rushing now because I want to be done with this.
[237:34.76]Alright, I gotta slow down.
[237:42.00]This is just never gonna happen.
[237:52.92]B-side.
[237:53.98]Or normie.
[237:55.04]You know what?
[237:55.36]What if I don't care if I'm a normie?
[237:58.15]Huh?
[237:59.27]Is that really that much of a problem to some of you?
[238:33.36]What?
[238:35.22]This is it.
[238:45.38]It's normie proof.
[238:47.56]This is what's at the center of all of this.
[238:51.06]It's so empty and vast.
[238:55.01]Yet it feels nostalgic somehow.
[239:01.47]And peaceful.
[239:17.55]Heart of the Mountain.
[239:28.86]Hooray.
[239:34.86]Yo, he's not a normie.
[239:36.12]No, that's not true.
[239:37.88]I have to beat the Seasides tape.
[239:43.04]I'm not gonna do it, but... That's okay.
[239:53.78]There's no way I'm gonna do that.
[239:57.59]Absolutely not.
[240:01.43]Oh, there's the bonus chapter.
[240:03.73]Now... I... Wait, I did the first B-sides.
[240:16.45]Where's the other one?
[240:17.27]We did this one already, yep.
[240:19.35]200 times died here.
[240:20.57]Alright, this is the Celestial Resort.
[240:23.79]I think we got a B-side here.
[240:36.73]One B is not unlocked.
[240:38.35]That's okay.
[240:43.75]This feels great compared to the thing I just did.
[240:51.85]I say that now and I'm gonna eat those words.
[240:55.69]I'm going to inhale those words very quickly, aren't I?
[241:03.96]Shit, that was... Welp, that's off.
[241:19.88]Uh-oh.
[241:20.97]Did beating that last bonus chapter just set in complete gamer fatigue?
[241:25.43]Can I even do this anymore?
[241:26.39]I might not be able to.
[242:02.24]Alright.
[242:02.64]Alright.
[242:02.94]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[242:05.24]I think I have to jump around.
[242:06.62]Oh, God.
[242:07.35]I don't know.
[242:10.63]Up and then over.
[242:11.53]Up and then over again?
[242:12.43]Maybe.
[242:13.61]Let's try it.
[242:14.77]Of course.
[242:18.28]I might need to take a Shito break.
[242:29.95]Alright, maybe, let me try this a few more times.
[242:32.70]And then we might take a Shito break.
[243:08.90]Oh my god, I blew it.
[243:10.06]I blew it.
[243:10.46]No, I didn't.
[243:10.86]It's still possible.
[243:11.64]It's still very possible.
[243:12.80]Fuck, I just ran out of grip.
[243:15.70]Ah, I had it too.
[243:17.08]Fuck me.
[243:25.93]My hair got in my face.
[243:29.25]It's like eating my hair.
[243:30.37]I'm just going, I'm shaving the whole thing off.
[243:33.45]I'm going bald.
[243:51.51]I don't even need to do- I can just fall down and grab it.
[243:56.91]No, I was not doing the same- oh my god.
[243:59.49]Nope.
[244:03.87]Shito time.
[244:08.52]Yeah, I don't know, I might have to put the cap on Celeste.
[244:12.52]It's a great game, but there's kinda only so much you can do in one sitting.
[244:18.88]Last night it was like five hours or so.
[244:20.40]I beat it four hours.
[244:23.70]These kind of games, they just drain the fuck out of my brain.
[244:37.58]I should be able to do at least somewhat.
[244:42.41]Okay, hold on.
[244:51.00]You gotta go down!
[244:52.83]Save the dash, maybe?
[244:56.49]No idea.
[244:59.65]Yeah, gamer fatigue sets in, and then you kinda can't do anything.
[245:04.31]This might turn into, like, a fucking automaton stream.
[245:09.98]That was it.
[245:10.36]That was it.
[245:10.66]You gotta just jump around.
[245:11.36]I got it.
[245:11.62]I got it.
[245:11.88]I got it here.
[245:12.34]You gotta jump around and grab the weapon.
[245:14.70]Like that.
[245:18.06]No.
[245:18.30]It's not what I wanted to do.
[245:22.92]Oh my god.
[245:25.16]It's so frustrating, you trying to move with your hands in the same- in the right direction, but it just doesn't happen.
[245:44.93]It's a great- it's a great game.
[245:47.39]It's one of- it's very challenging, very fun.
[245:52.12]As you can see, I'm still playing it even though, uh, gamer fatigue is set in.
[245:57.60]We're still going.
[245:58.06]Oh shit, I don't have two jumps anymore.
[246:12.41]You can tell he hates it.
[246:16.19]I don't ha- what are you- I don't hate-
[246:19.63]Holy shit, how am I gonna do this?
[246:21.41]You gotta go up and then... across?
[246:25.83]Yikes, I don't know.
[246:26.95]Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[246:31.37]He has tears rolling down his cheeks.
[246:45.60]They're streaming down my face.
[246:58.36]This guy at the bottom is going to cause so many problems because I have to go back, don't I?
[247:01.30]I'm just going to wait.
[247:20.56]That's going to be unbearable.
[247:29.92]Okay, okay, hold on.
[247:31.20]Ah, fuck.
[247:34.14]Oh my god, there's no way to stop.
[247:42.19]You just have to go.
[247:44.77]You can't stop for anything.
[247:56.59]That's not correct.
[247:57.65]Ah, I gotta go up to the top right.
[248:28.26]That's, I think, how you do it.
[248:30.40]The one thing is, though, I gotta take a look at how the hell I'm gonna get the one on the top right.
[248:33.94]I haven't even seen it yet.
[248:35.68]I haven't paid any attention to it.
[248:40.51]So it's off that, and then into the wall, and then back around.
[248:44.59]And I have to grab that ledge there in the bottom.
[248:57.52]nope I need that dash oh come on why why do you have to be down here don't ever beat this level the music's too good
[249:45.23]Alright, I wonder how many screens are left on this B side here.
[250:15.03]Should've stayed down.
[250:36.08]That's it.
[250:36.44]I figured it out, but I'm not going to have enough strength.
[250:38.25]I didn't want to grab the ledge.
[250:47.74]You couldn't have, like, slowed these guys down by, like, even 5%.
[250:50.46]What?
[250:50.76]So sick of this.
[251:04.55]I just freaked out.
[251:29.11]No, I would have had it.
[251:29.87]It's just the timing, time, timing, timing, timing, timing, timing.
[251:33.34]Like, oh, now, oh, go, okay, go, okay.
[251:38.80]I can't stop right now.
[251:39.78]I'll lose all this progress.
[251:42.00]I have to get to the end of this.
[251:44.19]And then I'm going to transition to, like, IRL for, like, fucking 40 minutes.
[251:49.67]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[251:55.90]sunk cost I already look at this like screen number five there can't be that much more happening I had to grab on oh
[252:41.69]The one thing that sucks is because you have such a small amount of area to have to grab and you just suck to it and it's so difficult to just not jump.
[252:52.01]You've got such a tiny little area.
[252:53.46]See, like, I just grabbed that.
[252:54.60]I really didn't want to.
[252:56.00]And I've got to go round and round and round.
[252:57.58]God, man.
[252:58.80]There's just absolute zero room for error.
[253:03.00]Zero.
[253:05.24]You've got to be a fucking robot.
[253:08.60]Like that.
[253:09.30]I- And I didn't wanna jump, Meat Boy!
[253:11.80]You fucked my whole game up!
[253:29.65]Fuck off, Meat Boy!
[253:41.99]I had no, I couldn't believe it.
[253:51.45]Fucking Donkey Kong.
[253:54.47]Oh man, this is gonna take all night.
[254:02.45]No, I thought I had two jumps.
[254:03.90]Why did they take that away from me?
[254:04.90]I should have done this earlier.
[254:06.22]No, I shouldn't have.
[254:06.80]What are you talking about?
[254:11.84]Anybody know how many screens I have left after this one?
[254:24.19]Two?
[254:33.92]Let me sit here for a second.
[254:40.64]Ayayay.
[254:41.39]There's just so many moving parts.
[254:43.39]There's so many moving parts to need to perfect.
[255:07.20]Eat my ass.
[255:08.46]Let's go.
[255:29.78]Where were you when Shido died of neglect?
[255:45.75]He's flying.
[255:46.43]He's eating today.
[255:47.11]I threw up in his mouth.
[255:48.09]He's gonna be just fine.
[256:01.87]Oh, yeah, I gotta... I don't know how much I can take of this.
[256:04.76]I'm sorry.
[256:05.60]I'm trying my best.
[256:06.94]And it's just like, it's so much to have to do.
[256:15.06]Yeah, where the fuck was Einstein during this shit?
[256:18.34]Do you think Einstein would have been able to do this?
[256:21.24]No, he would have been like, what the fuck is this shit?
[256:23.65]I have to climb on this side and just... I don't get it.
[256:26.55]And then people would be like, oh, boomer!
[256:28.63]Einstein, you're a boomer!
[256:30.73]What are you saying?
[256:32.01]I don't get this either.
[256:53.51]Boom?
[256:56.15]Oh, that's the spikes.
[257:03.50]It's just like you gotta go down when it's up and up when it's down and your brain doesn't work that way, your brain doesn't work in that kind of order!
[257:09.12]I'm gonna beat this one.
[257:15.83]Trust me.
[257:17.59]I can go through, I can dash.
[257:25.65]I jumped for no reason.
[257:41.22]Now I want to grab.
[257:42.70]Oh my god.
[257:49.11]This is not nearly the hardest B-side.
[257:51.37]I'll never do it.
[257:55.33]Just torture yourself.
[257:57.80]I don't want to torture myself.
[257:59.06]I'm going to do a couple of them.
[258:16.32]The couple hasn't guessed this one.
[258:17.48]I already did one.
[258:17.98]I did one yesterday.
[258:21.25]This would be two.
[258:32.36]Now, again, it's like blending in with the background.
[258:34.80]That little tiny two boxes.
[259:01.03]Thought I didn't grab the edge this small little fucking area to grab Now I'm getting angry and you're not gonna I can't play well and when you're just fucking angry I
[259:19.69]I have no idea where to go.
[259:40.26]I have no idea what's happening.
[259:41.56]That way.
[259:58.34]You know, I probably would assume that this would be the hardest.
[260:01.18]I'm going to open up one of the other B-sides.
[260:03.40]Because you all know, like the whole game I've had trouble with the things that move in up and down, up and down.
[260:12.59]They've caused me a problem the whole game.
[260:13.91]So, you know, this might just be my kryptonite.
[260:40.14]Like, I have to wait for the perfect opportunity.
[260:42.82]Alright, I guess it's now!
[260:50.23]I'm so screwed.
[261:16.25]Ugh!
[261:16.67]It's so painful!
[261:23.87]I tried to let go.
[261:27.11]I tried.
[261:47.07]Now, I guess?
[261:47.77]And then around, I guess?
[261:50.62]Oh my lord, you gotta... ooooh.
[262:07.21]Probably the correct way to do it is to wrap around the guy.
[262:11.69]Right?
[262:12.01]And yeah, that's it, I did it.
[262:14.21]Oh, that took forever.
[262:16.71]No, not this.
[262:17.97]What am I supposed to do about this?
[262:24.58]Fake bits!
[262:25.48]Stop!
[262:32.64]You made me laugh and it ruined everything!
[262:34.64]$300 in fake bits!
[262:46.71]That's fucking funny.
[262:59.04]No, no more of these moving sponges!
[263:07.43]I got it.
[263:08.97]Yeah, you did.
[263:20.13]That's kind of what I need to do.
[263:21.60]Kind of.
[263:22.30]Maybe.
[263:23.46]In some weird, wild world.
[263:27.58]Hey, thanks for the $500,000, guys.
[263:29.56]I have to prove this isn't pre-recorded.
[263:37.78]How am I supposed to prove that?
[263:40.04]That.
[263:40.34]That's how.
[263:41.69]No, stop saying these things!
[263:57.43]And what am I... I didn't get the diamond.
[264:02.14]Didn't get the diamond.
[264:07.03]Money is all he cares about.
[264:08.69]That's not true.
[264:29.23]God, no!
[264:30.27]I just... oh.
[264:34.97]Goodness.
[264:46.26]Just jump over it, and then across!
[264:50.76]Boston Boomer cares about money.
[265:03.04]I guess I just do that?
[265:13.68]That one's not that bad.
[265:17.27]But this is probably gonna be bad.
[265:22.21]Turn on the facecam?
[265:24.05]Oh, that falls.
[265:26.53]No, no facecam.
[265:38.71]Please just jump off it over and over again.
[265:40.69]I would love it if you did that.
[265:44.58]Here's the funny thing.
[265:46.26]I am never going to be able to play Meat Boy ever again.
[265:48.16]Not that I would, but I'm going to try to climb onto walls and stuff.
[266:00.85]I have no idea.
[266:01.55]How the fuck would you ever do that on the first try?
[266:24.85]No I didn't.
[266:25.31]Oh no, this guy's back again?!
[266:28.01]This is really bad, isn't it?
[266:35.37]How am I supposed to jump over that?
[266:50.20]Jump over it?
[266:51.90]I have to jump on his head!
[267:06.17]Cheetos coming
[267:32.56]Um, honest to god, it's- the analog or the d-pad, even if you had something precise, this would just be fucking so hard to get that.
[267:42.83]You gotta jump up and grab- how the hell are you supposed to do that?
[268:13.84]you gotta go around and grab it again that has to be how you do it
[268:44.02]Oh, I'm gonna be so glad I don't dump this.
[268:46.70]Just get me to the end of this.
[268:49.14]But you can only do one of these, like, once a year.
[268:53.17]Or you're gonna lose... you're gonna just go hollow.
[268:55.01]You'll just lose your sanity.
[269:07.46]Doing, like, the B-sides is seriously... is like smoking, like, three packs of cigarettes a day.
[269:53.06]This game isn't even that hard.
[269:55.18]Just put your face on the stove top.
[270:04.80]That would be so stupid.
[270:06.56]Like, you have to be so perfect.
[270:13.00]Why?
[270:13.52]I think I'm done.
[270:15.03]I think I'm done.
[270:17.61]I gave it a good attempt, but I'm too fatigued.
[270:20.70]I'm too drained to do this.
[270:29.72]I'm giving up at the finish line.
[270:31.02]I don't want to smoke any more cigarettes.
[270:32.84]I don't want to smoke any more cigarettes.
[270:38.02]You understand?
[270:39.50]Ugh.
[270:42.80]Just put your face on the stovetop.
[270:54.93]The spring was so close I just have to touch the spring and I would have had it done.
[271:10.46]Oh My god
[271:26.48]Okay It's been like a hundred and fifty attempts and that's the first time that guy has hit me He doesn't even need to be here and this will still be unbearable Wait for me.
[271:46.94]Did I win?
[272:04.27]I gotta jump on him up there.
[272:13.14]I gotta hit him.
[272:15.00]No I don't.
[272:19.22]Oh my god.
[272:20.40]You've gotta be kidding me.
[272:30.45]What happened?
[273:06.99]Do it for Shido, I'm gonna try.
[273:13.68]What else have you got for me?
[273:44.70]Oh, no.
[273:46.20]I gotta hit him.
[273:46.66]I gotta jump on his head.
[273:47.54]Goodness gracious.
[273:59.39]How am I supposed to get that one?
[274:12.94]Give Shito the controller.
[274:15.04]It's not gonna help!
[274:20.66]Oh fuck, no!
[274:21.52]I almost got it!
[274:21.94]Hit him in the head!
[274:23.48]Ohhh, you gotta jump.
[274:26.56]This is just a noise stream.
[274:28.30]All I'm doing is just making noises and shit.
[274:32.20]Just getting my ass kicked and making noises.
[274:35.24]I didn't even get that one over there.
[274:52.86]No.
[274:53.40]Shit.
[274:53.76]I would have had it.
[275:00.80]No.
[275:01.50]I gotta get it that way.
[275:09.62]I fucked myself so hard.
[275:10.70]Hold on.
[275:11.86]I just screwed myself.
[275:13.12]Oh my god.
[275:15.34]I just screwed myself over so badly.
[275:17.86]So hard.
[275:18.62]Oh.
[275:28.77]How can I not get that by jumping off his head?
[275:34.18]That's like what you're supposed to do.
[275:36.76]And that is what you're supposed to do.
[275:55.86]I'm still not even understanding this yet.
[276:18.21]It's gonna take me like another 300 attempts to beat this stupid fucking level.
[276:37.00]I didn't, I just, alright.
[276:38.89]It's the let go of the right trigger, I would have probably had a better time with her.
[276:47.47]Fuck.
[276:51.36]Just spurt it up again, I can get it back.
[277:14.24]Eat a snack and regroup?
[277:15.72]No, I can't.
[277:16.94]I'm never opening this game ever again.
[277:19.18]So, I better do it now.
[277:28.87]I better do it now.
[277:37.49]Hates game?
[277:38.21]No!
[277:38.51]I just- I can't- I'm at the point in the game where I beat it, and it's just excruciating shit left.
[277:45.42]When am I gonna have time to do this?
[277:50.00]I'm not gonna stream it.
[277:52.72]I gotta like, cook food and shit!
[277:54.97]I had to cook food- AHH!
[278:02.37]Guys, do you understand my daily routine?
[278:04.59]I stream a game, and then I cook food for seven and a half hours.
[278:13.12]I've done.
[278:14.02]Totally.
[278:14.98]I've lost it all.
[278:23.21]My brain can't handle these motions and movements.
[278:26.19]I have to finish it though.
[278:27.77]Otherwise we can't see Shido.
[278:41.62]No, you gotta do it on this one.
[278:49.87]You gotta hit it there.
[278:50.73]And then I fucked it up.
[278:56.23]What even hit me?
[278:57.29]What the fuck even hit me?
[279:01.82]This sucks such ass.
[279:03.44]Oh, I'm gonna... Do you want to talk about a 2018 meltdown?
[279:06.24]It's gonna happen right here.
[279:13.03]It's just too much!
[279:28.56]Why did those pop out?
[279:30.04]I thought I had to touch them for the Omni.
[279:35.49]I'm not even close, by the way.
[279:37.43]There's like a whole- I'm at like the first third of this whole stage.
[279:40.69]This whole screen.
[279:53.56]He's losing his mind.
[279:54.70]I am starting to lose my mind.
[280:06.74]I gotta hit him.
[280:07.70]I have to hit it.
[280:11.02]What the fuck happened?
[280:12.58]What?
[280:12.98]No.
[280:13.58]I'm being shocked.
[280:16.38]I'm being strangled.
[280:24.57]It's this fun, really fun mechanic called Stuff Grows Out After You Touch Wall.
[280:32.16]It's the funnest fucking mechanic in the game.
[280:35.04]It's my favorite.
[280:36.60]Have I told you about my favorite, sweetie?
[280:39.28]It's the best.
[281:06.24]And suddenly I begin to see.
[281:10.93]And suddenly I begin to see.
[281:15.59]I've got a golden ticket.
[281:18.21]It's ours, Charlie.
[281:28.86]I didn't even move.
[281:29.84]Why is it growing?
[281:36.68]Alright, alright like fuck fuck that dumb watch you want to know the part that's really annoying When he's about to dash and he distorts the screen Like look at it.
[281:47.11]What like what why why does it have to happen like?
[281:51.05]Is there a reason why that has to happen?
[281:52.27]Can I like turn that feature off
[282:08.44]It's giving me blurry vision.
[282:21.11]I had it beat, dude.
[282:23.52]Unbelievable.
[282:29.10]Again, I didn't fucking move, I didn't do shit.
[282:31.08]This is the opportunity for- That just fucking ruined everything, but no it didn't.
[282:36.75]I have to hit him in the head.
[282:40.33]Don't grab!
[282:41.03]Over!
[282:41.73]DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!
[282:57.12]I remember I watched this guy stream this game.
[283:04.43]And this part's not even hard.
[283:05.79]Like, I beat this in like fuckin' two tries.
[283:07.51]I don't think he was- he was losing his mind.
[283:12.86]He's like crazy.
[283:13.64]Have you heard of this guy?
[283:14.50]Oh yeah, he's terrible at the game.
[283:16.78]He's like really bad and blames a bunch of stuff on his Xbox controller.
[283:20.42]I don't think he even has an Xbox controller.
[283:22.14]I think he's using like a PC Madcast controller.
[283:25.48]I think he's just an idiot.
[283:34.05]I gotta time this.
[283:34.75]We gotta wait.
[283:37.03]I have to go now.
[283:37.85]I have to go now.
[283:41.53]And then... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[283:42.75]I gotta land over there.
[283:43.77]Don't move.
[283:49.16]Okay.
[283:49.78]Now, I've got an opportunity.
[283:51.04]I gotta bounce.
[283:52.96]And... Stupid game.
[283:59.20]I did it.
[283:59.46]I win.
[284:00.30]I win.
[284:00.64]I win.
[284:01.06]I win.
[284:01.30]I win.
[284:01.52]I win.
[284:01.68]I did it.
[284:01.96]I did it.
[284:02.28]I did it.
[284:02.66]Just touch it.
[284:03.08]I win.
[284:03.28]I win.
[284:26.72]No, not that number.
[284:39.59]Of all the numbers you could have given me, you have to give me that one.
[284:47.83]Well, okay.
[284:53.60]Alright, wait a minute.
[284:58.79]342, 243.
[284:59.21]This is actually cursed.
[285:13.18]I need to never play the game again.
[285:21.28]I don't get the reference.
[285:23.02]That number was like a meme joke number from like a year and a half ago.
[285:30.09]It was killed last year, or the year before.
[285:33.46]That's weird.
[285:53.53]Is the best song well we're about to hear it Which cheeto
[286:22.55]I know, but just wait.
[286:23.75]I just need to see how this one is.
[286:28.08]This one's not bad.
[286:29.00]This one's okay.
[286:39.76]That was close.
[286:52.15]Oh well, I didn't know that.
[286:54.11]Is my brain fried?
[286:55.11]Oh yeah, it fried like an hour and a half ago.
[286:56.57]It just pisses you up in the ear.
[287:06.21]Take a guess.
[287:14.90]I think I need- no, okay, hold on, hold on, I can get it from there.
[287:24.15]I'm going to need a caretaker if I play for another five minutes.
[287:28.15]I just need to see what this one is.
[287:29.29]I'm not going to play through this one.
[287:35.75]Unless... Hold on, what?
[287:42.65]We get to see Shito.
[287:45.07]And then I'm probably going to go.
[287:48.81]Maybe like an hour from now.
[287:52.12]I'm addicted.
[287:52.68]Okay.
[287:57.90]This is okay, though, because there's no moving parts.
[288:00.12]It's just spikes, and be careful.
[288:02.82]Don't screw it up.
[288:09.67]That's the name of this game.
[288:12.01]Holy shit.
[288:26.04]The moving part.
[288:37.01]Oh my god, how is this supposed to work?
[288:39.85]How are you supposed to get that done?
[288:43.52]How are you even supposed to do this?
[288:48.02]It's not even possible.
[288:49.22]It's not possible to do this.
[288:52.78]It's impossible to do this.
[288:59.58]What do I do?
[289:19.63]I did it, and I needed another centimeter.
[289:24.74]Why would they even put the spike?
[289:25.73]You're like, I beat the level.
[289:27.55]You really have to put a huge thing of spikes at the very fucking end.
[289:33.01]Right at the end.
[289:33.49]Like, I already did all this bullshit.
[289:35.89]And you're gonna make me do it again.
[289:37.02]I just laughed.
[289:46.36]You gotta be kidding me.
[289:53.07]When you get to a position like this, where you watched the level get completed... I already completed it, so I'm going back and doing it again.
[290:16.32]And I don't like it, you know?
[290:17.78]I don't like that.
[290:20.31]It was completed.
[290:21.19]Yes, it was.
[290:22.03]I completed it.
[290:22.93]I did it.
[290:23.25]No, I did!
[290:24.43]I did.
[290:24.75]I did it.
[290:25.75]I beat the level, and that's all there is to it.
[290:28.87]I had an unfair troll spike at the very end.
[290:32.91]That's all.
[290:33.45]Mmm, Xbox.
[290:34.51]Mmm, baby, it's me, Xbox.
[290:39.80]Just when you thought you had a good attempt, Xbox comes around and gives you extra sodium.
[290:54.74]I'm all the way back in my chair.
[290:56.08]I did it already.
[291:10.57]This guy's a fucking nutcase.
[291:12.80]Hey, I made some mashed potatoes.
[291:20.12]Would you like some?
[291:20.94]I would love some.
[291:22.04]Please put some on my plate.
[291:26.37]Is this for real?
[291:26.80]Are you just kidding?
[291:27.70]Dude, don't do that, man.
[291:28.58]I love mashed potatoes.
[291:29.48]Don't fucking do that.
[291:55.95]Okay.
[292:31.23]He's awake.
[292:33.97]Do you want to be on stream?
[292:36.81]No?
[292:39.01]No?
[292:40.19]You don't want to be on stream.
[292:42.87]Is there a reason why?
[292:44.11]What's wrong?
[292:48.27]Chat was being very mean to me.
[292:50.51]And you don't like that.
[292:52.55]No.
[292:56.03]What should I tell them?
[293:05.49]okay that if they if they want you to be on camera yeah oh to be to be nice being nicer to me oh okay you want to go back to bed okay well um have a good rest there you go do you like your new bed

[293:41.89]You gotta get to bed.
[293:42.55]You got school tomorrow.
[293:44.55]No, no, don't give me that.
[293:46.21]Excuse me.
[293:47.35]You have school tomorrow.
[293:48.39]You gotta get up.
[293:48.89]You gotta learn.
[293:50.31]No, go.
[293:51.23]Get to bed.
[293:52.05]I'll get you.
[293:52.62]I'll read you a story later.
[293:54.30]Okay.
[293:56.04]You want a story?
[293:59.00]Okay, sure.
[294:00.36]Everybody see you later.
[294:05.13]Good night.
[294:11.10]Sorry, I wasn't paying attention to what was going on here.
[294:14.30]What's going on in chat here?
[294:19.10]He's talking to a toy now.
[294:22.70]Toy?
[294:23.44]What?
[294:23.80]He means Shito.
[294:50.26]I swear to god, I don't get it.
[294:51.50]I just have to dash down, right?
[294:53.02]I'm just overthinking the fuck out of that and it's the very end.
[294:56.74]It's the block.
[295:09.21]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[295:27.94]Fuck, I just gotta- Oh, man.
[295:30.35]You just have to dash.
[295:32.81]Or do you?
[295:33.31]I don't even know.
[295:34.17]I think my eye might be bleeding.
[295:35.77]I made it.
[295:40.50]Okay, I'm good.
[296:04.65]My eyes bleeding no, those are just cheaters He's gotta be quick I gotta get right to the bottom Jump
[296:28.68]How on Earth am I supposed to get up there that fast?
[296:36.05]Like that.
[296:36.45]Okay.
[296:37.41]This is a win.
[296:39.13]Thanks for watching.
[296:41.55]I'll see you guys later.
[296:52.86]See you guys in the next stream.
[296:53.62]It's going to be a fun one.
[296:54.99]We're going to be playing Dreamcast!
[296:56.89]Remember that?
[297:28.58]I'm actually not entirely certain on what the fuck I need to do here.
[297:36.19]What stream do I die?
[297:38.01]January 23rd is when I'm supposed to be dying.
[297:40.51]That's the date that I was told.
[297:41.63]From the fortune teller thing.
[297:57.92]You have it marked on your calendar?
[297:59.34]That's kind of morbid.
[298:07.44]That's how you do it.
[298:08.02]Okay, I just need to grab and get on top and jump again.
[298:20.07]That's how you do it.
[298:21.43]Gotta get it.
[298:26.38]You dumb game.
[298:36.74]It's so strong.
[298:37.80]This might be one of the last screens before I, uh... ...literally shit my pants on camera.
[298:49.60]No, don't say that!
[298:51.28]No, I get it.
[298:51.98]I'm just- I'm very flus-flustrated.
[298:54.44]And I'm saying things.
[299:00.05]Okay, I'm fine.
[299:12.04]Take a break and come back refreshed.
[299:14.90]No, I'll be alright.
[299:16.76]I think, I think I'm over the, uh, over the hump there.
[299:20.65]I can just relax and just chill and I can play.
[299:24.75]I can do it.
[299:40.07]The wind is so bad because it just everything you've known and done the whole game the Compensating for the jumps and the dashes.
[299:48.79]It just makes you everything you've done the whole game You have to redo it again because you have the muscle memory for jumps and dashes and they just make you slower and faster Whenever they damn well feel like it
[300:13.05]Oh my god, I didn't even... I didn't know that was a... $50?
[300:19.61]$50 from... Colonel Zero.
[300:23.07]Thank you so much for the 50 bucks.
[300:25.36]5,000 bits.
[300:28.42]Didn't I jump on that?
[300:29.24]Why didn't it refresh my jump?
[300:31.10]My gosh.
[300:33.70]Uh, Jerma, for the love of god, please stop, is what they say.
[300:39.32]I'm doing just fine.
[300:41.10]I appreciate the concern.
[300:52.10]I'm still having fun.
[300:53.60]If I wasn't having fun, dude, no.
[300:55.04]Because I would say things like, uh, this is stupid.
[301:00.16]Uh, fuck this controller.
[301:03.34]Uh, this game is too fucking hard.
[301:06.77]Why am I doing this?
[301:07.41]I have to stop.
[301:08.09]Stuff like that.
[301:09.47]That's what you typically would hear.
[301:10.53]Another great one is, uh, why is this in the game?
[301:20.76]Uh, like, for instance, if I were to take, like, uh, I mean, I haven't done this, but, like, you could tell if I was, like, a little bit upset about something.
[301:27.56]If, uh, you know, what's with the wind mechanic?
[301:30.02]It fucking ruins the game.
[301:31.64]If there's stuff like that, that's how you can really have an indicator of how things are going with the stream so far, you know?
[301:40.90]Or, um, holding right on the Xbox controller for some reason makes you go upright.
[301:45.26]If you hear that, then there's a possibility that I might be a little, just a slight, small amount irritated.
[301:56.71]Again, all things that have not really happened yet.
[302:00.25]So, I'm fine.
[302:03.29]Beat that screen?
[302:03.89]That was fun.
[302:12.56]Well, this one's not going to be fun.
[302:18.10]Can I not move it?
[302:23.54]I think I just have to grab the wall.
[302:44.86]Uh, the other side.
[302:45.64]Shit.
[302:46.22]Go ahead.
[303:02.23]I don't think I even need the spring.
[303:10.98]Holy shit, I gotta go much faster than that.
[303:13.26]Say something funny?
[303:16.92]Ummm, how about... How the fuck am I gonna do that?
[303:29.36]0.01% of your body evaporates every time I die.
[303:35.04]That doesn't sound good.
[303:41.08]Well, how much is left of you?
[303:44.30]I might have to dash underneath.
[303:53.39]Like this, but no.
[304:10.26]That's the live way to get around the other side.
[304:16.82]Straight up?
[304:19.66]Dash above the platform?
[304:23.16]I mean, isn't that- that'll kill me, won't it?
[304:26.52]So I have to de- if you're talking about dash up and then move around, that's gonna be absolute hell.
[304:48.28]How many cigarettes have I smoked so far?
[305:14.42]Okay, I... You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[305:24.15]I... How are you... Why?
[305:27.45]Why do you have to do that?
[305:30.43]Is there really a reason to have you switch sides like that again?
[305:45.79]I can't even do it again.
[305:46.57]I have Ratic Rift.
[305:52.89]I'm not even sure if I'm halfway up or not.
[305:55.89]Now I gotta get around again?
[306:05.22]And then around again?
[306:07.38]And then around again?!
[306:09.02]I did it.
[306:11.54]Wow.
[306:12.24]Okay.
[306:25.07]Wind bullshit.
[306:30.30]Another big bits.
[306:33.44]G-H-Y-D-H-F-E.
[306:37.54]Thank you.
[306:39.76]Gid?
[306:40.08]Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[306:42.68]5,000 bits.
[306:43.46]Thank you so much.
[306:47.36]Hey, Jerma.
[306:47.72]I've had countless sleepless nights for years because of the single question.
[306:51.12]If you got cloned, would you...
[307:26.56]Well, to answer your question... I just drove right into that.
[307:32.75]I would... I'm gonna go with a no.
[307:36.99]No, it was... Answer the question!
[307:42.79]What kind of question is that?
[307:45.33]Answer the question!
[308:18.10]No more clone, no more clone question And I have to wait because so many levels have the one thing in the level that's timed I got a timing moving object And I also have a bunch of fucking wind
[308:49.15]I wonder how many times I've said, oh my fucking god.
[308:51.16]It's probably been like 5,000 times.
[309:00.28]Is this where I just turn this off and eat a packet of cigarettes on screen?
[309:06.41]I think I can make that.
[309:37.33]No, I didn't Alright, I think this is where I give up
[309:47.02]For another day.
[309:47.66]For my niece or my nephew when they're old enough to play it, because I won't open it ever again.
[309:54.49]So, we'll see.
[309:55.47]Whenever they play it in like 30 years.
[310:05.35]What am I doing?
[310:15.56]I didn't even get it.
[310:21.67]Name your child second Jerma.
[310:28.77]Honestly, I didn't even want to...
[310:43.19]Can I even make that jump, though?
[310:44.91]I don't even know if I can.
[310:45.81]Like, can I make that?
[310:48.01]I don't know.
[310:48.85]How far down did it go?
[311:03.54]How did I not make it?
[311:11.61]One guy said it was too loud, so I am inclined to agree.
[311:21.08]Apparently not this time.
[311:27.58]Alright, here we go.
[311:32.18]That wind almost just screwed me over there.
[311:41.67]My god What the fuck happened?
[311:45.49]What am I doing?
[311:46.31]How did I just do that?
[311:48.05]I don't know how I did that.
[311:49.97]I closed my eyes The wind is even stronger now
[312:14.98]Oh my god.
[312:15.28]I don't have a dash.
[312:16.75]You need a dash or you can't do it.
[312:34.56]Holding right.
[312:35.08]This is the last time I'm ever gonna use this controller, by the way.
[312:38.90]This thing's actually going into the trash.
[312:41.28]And I'm gonna actually set up the PS4 controller.
[312:43.20]This thing is absolute dogshit.
[313:04.24]Oh god.
[313:06.70]Put a camera on the controller.
[313:27.02]Just like botched inputs.
[313:31.00]Again, nothing changed.
[313:34.82]Not one single thing changed.
[313:37.88]I was holding it in the same position as the last one.
[313:41.40]But for some fucked up reason, I didn't want to do it.
[313:45.41]It was like, no thanks.
[313:46.95]We're not doing that now.
[313:49.79]Wait.
[314:04.45]Yeah, now there's no more wind and it's like ruining everything!
[314:07.14]Does that go all the way up?
[314:17.35]Umm... What the hell?
[314:34.19]I fucked it up.
[314:36.35]Wait, no, I've... No.
[314:47.54]I gotta jump around and down, I think.
[314:49.60]Yeah, I gotta go down on the same one.
[314:56.13]Like this.
[315:00.32]And then go around.
[315:01.44]And then... Then fall and jump through.
[315:07.15]And then that's it.
[315:09.70]I should be there.
[315:10.36]I could probably go now, but I can't.
[315:29.88]It's close, just not fast enough.
[315:45.31]More moving parts.
[315:46.67]Alright.
[316:15.97]I gotta eventually be on the middle one.
[316:21.86]That sounds like a defeated man.
[316:23.90]I mean, yeah.
[316:27.87]But not really, though, because I'm still completing screens.
[316:33.63]I might be complaining the whole way there, and I might be annoyed by it, but...
[316:39.26]It's not defeat until I press the exit button.
[316:44.16]Which will probably actually truly happen.
[316:52.05]At the end of this B-side.
[316:53.05]Because there really is only so much of these games you can take.
[316:59.91]Before you have to... You have to just stop looking at a screen.
[317:29.50]When the game forces you to go a certain speed You're just dangling in so many directions like I want to just go with my speed Didn't hold on to it apparently
[317:57.49]Grillmaster Braid.
[318:01.92]Wasn't he voted worst character last year?
[318:03.88]Yeah, he was.
[318:45.15]I think that has to go first.
[319:00.00]Ah, I gotta go.

[319:35.42]What did it hit?
[319:38.85]What is it hitting?
[319:52.24]I have to pull it.
[319:54.01]This is so, this is pain.
[319:55.89]It actually is pain.
[320:13.65]Oh no, man!
[320:25.57]does that thing have can somebody explain to me what this arrow above me is even for if you just touch it and it moves why is it here what's the point of this being here it doesn't change it just it's just annoying what's it even there for it's just adding an extra two three seconds to the game for what
[321:26.05]Alright, this is the last hard game for like six months.
[321:35.19]These stupid games, seriously, my god.
[321:53.46]There's no grill bastard raid.
[321:55.14]He's not even real.
[321:57.56]Say it's not real.
[321:59.81]Alright, okay, that's time to go.
[322:07.96]That's time to go.
[322:09.66]I can't take this shit anymore.
[322:25.21]I have to pull that out of the way.
[322:32.18]You gotta pull that shit out of the way too.
[323:00.05]Wrong side.
[323:00.88]I hope this is one of the last screens.
[323:12.63]Cause... No.
[323:14.15]You know what I mean?
[323:16.15]Like, nope.
[323:21.32]The fact that you gotta just get on the other side so quickly.
[323:24.18]It's just my god.
[323:25.66]It's it's it's so excruciating.
[323:28.29]It's excruciating Is jumping and move it's just so my goodness And the fucking cloud nice cloud oh
[324:03.18]Why?
[324:03.40]It's like, oh my god, this stupid jumping mechanic is so fucking annoying.
[324:09.51]It's like, it makes me want to scream.
[324:13.71]The trampoline effect that you have to produce with this thing every time.
[324:17.04]Ooh.
[324:37.81]Old man yells at Cloud.
[324:39.33]That's a Simpsons joke.
[324:54.61]Falling off and grabbing the edges.
[324:57.92]There's so much room for error.
[324:59.80]Like that.
[325:00.46]Like just trying to get on the other side of this stupid fucking Minecraft block.
[325:16.80]No, no.
[325:17.69]It's got to be perfect.
[325:18.39]100% perfect.
[325:18.79]You got three trampoline clouds to deal with here.
[325:45.75]Get it out of my... Is this the last screen?
[325:52.96]I hope it is.
[325:55.50]My nieces and nephews are gonna love this game.
[326:16.72]Why didn't it?
[326:17.40]What?
[326:17.64]Why?
[326:17.88]Why does it stop holding on to it?
[326:20.48]Oh.
[326:21.76]But so, why did it not move for that time?
[326:24.72]What was the reason for it?
[326:26.31]I don't understand.
[326:27.39]It, I grabbed it.
[326:34.83]Dr. Phil raid?
[326:36.33]I don't care.
[326:38.29]Dr. Phil.
[326:39.85]I'm gonna need to go on Dr. Phil after I'm done with this.
[327:07.09]Why can you please just move out of the goddamn way?
[327:19.37]MOVE!
[327:20.99]Wait, what?
[327:21.79]Wait, I have to stand on top?
[327:22.93]It wasn't in the right spot?
[327:24.25]Oh, I don't know.
[327:25.03]It has to be in the perfect middle spot and you ride it.
[327:29.39]Oh, I didn't even know what the... I've never seen it before.
[327:31.43]Okay, that's it.
[327:35.72]That's it, I'm done.
[327:42.42]No fucking way.
[327:43.94]I thought there was space to ride it up.
[327:45.72]I didn't know I had to go right on top of it.
[327:52.07]If only there was a telescope.
[327:53.85]But I don't... I'm too angry to look at that telescope.
[327:58.71]It's gonna kill me.
[328:02.40]Watch.
[328:02.78]Look.
[328:06.86]I thought there was space on side.
[328:08.88]I really did.
[328:09.62]I don't think I would have had it anyways.
[328:13.82]Because I didn't get the top one fast enough.
[328:25.25]I'm so close to doing this.
[328:26.59]Like, I have to do it.
[328:27.57]I have to at least get past this screen.
[328:30.08]Like, I have to.
[328:32.22]I've already been here for so long.
[328:34.16]Memorizing the whole damn level.
[328:35.70]Doesn't matter.
[328:43.22]Even if I touch it.
[328:44.28]I didn't grab it in the perfect place.
[329:01.40]I didn't... That didn't catch... How did I not jump on that second one?
[329:21.15]And I'm just... I... I'm so annoyed with this level.
[329:26.93]Why can't I just jump around?
[329:28.15]Do I have to do this, like, pull the lever bullshit?
[329:36.30]I feel like I'm playing a different game.
[329:37.56]Get out of the fucking way.
[330:10.00]This game is ripping off Celeste.
[330:19.74]Who we raiding?
[330:20.44]Jerma?
[330:20.72]Oh, it's a Jerma raid!
[330:24.22]Thanks a lot, Jerma!
[330:37.69]This is going to be really hard to do, because I have to change the analog position a lot of times, and we all know how well that goes.
[330:42.93]Do I have to dash out of that?
[330:50.47]I have no idea.
[330:59.64]Can I just jump over it?
[331:01.28]I think I've tried that like twice and it doesn't do anything.
[331:20.85]Yeah, for my sanity's sake, this has got to be the last time I fucking do this.
[331:26.31]I'm talking like tonight.
[331:27.17]Like, this is it.
[331:28.40]When I get to the end of this, whatever this side, whatever tape this is on, whatever mixtape this is, is it?
[331:37.98]No, I can't.
[331:38.80]You have to... How am I supposed... How do I do that?
[331:40.76]Go back...
[331:44.39]If I dash, I hit the wall.
[331:46.13]If I try to jump over or just fall over, I hit the wall.
[331:50.08]I must have to fall a little and then dash up.
[331:57.06]Yeah.
[332:12.02]I just want to go up.
[332:14.32]No, I'm just trying to rush now.
[332:24.69]Fuck off.
[332:28.45]More wind.
[332:30.38]This has got to be it.
[332:37.69]Oh, the wind starts and goes different directions.
[332:40.61]Wow.
[332:45.06]Fucking gimmicks, man.
[332:50.04]Any more gimmicks?
[332:51.88]You got any more gimmicks?
[333:25.78]No.
[333:33.95]I just have to... This is the last screen.
[333:41.37]Nope.
[333:42.55]Wait.
[333:43.13]Don't go.
[333:44.05]Just wait.
[333:45.86]There's no reason to.
[333:46.62]I'm gonna jump directly into the fucking wind.
[333:50.34]And...
[334:00.92]Oh no.
[334:02.99]I'm gonna wait for the wind to pick up here.
[334:10.57]I didn't even mean to do that, it was the end.
[334:13.32]I could've probably done it in one go.
[334:30.49]What are you guys even doing?
[334:39.38]No, I... No, I had to do it because I was gonna fall off anyways.
[334:42.42]I could... Hold on.
[334:50.22]Okay.
[334:51.54]Not it.
[334:58.42]We're going fucking insane because you want stuff.
[335:03.62]Okay, that's enough.
[335:05.32]I'll see you guys.
[335:06.28]I'll see you guys later.
[335:09.06]Alright.
[335:10.99]That's gonna be... Alright, this is... This is...
[335:20.27]No, I have to... Holy... No, this is not that bad.
[335:22.41]This is not that bad.
[335:23.73]It's way worse than... You go on the... Stepped on gum.
[335:27.53]And then you fall... Okay, hold on.
[335:41.56]Alright, in ten tries, if I don't get this, I'm turning it off.
[335:47.82]One.
[335:52.91]Two.
[335:58.89]Three.
[336:02.95]That one doesn't count.
[336:03.55]I'm angry.
[336:04.61]I gotta stop counting.
[336:05.81]Whatever that one was.
[336:06.51]It was a four.
[336:08.62]Five.
[336:12.94]Six.
[336:18.60]Seven.
[336:18.88]It's just... Like, give me a goddamn break.
[336:26.09]He's throwing on purpose.
[336:27.23]I promise you I'm not.
[336:28.07]It's just that unbearable.
[336:30.07]It's just that fucking excruciating.
[336:46.29]intentionally doing it alright that's enough I'll see you guys no don't shut off windows I just hit alt f4 and it was trying to shut windows off
[337:18.37]Save and quit.
[337:19.21]I don't care.
[337:20.50]My nieces and nephews are going to love that game.
[337:32.74]This is too much.
[337:35.38]I looked at chat and somebody wrote that this screen took me an hour to beat.
[337:40.68]I was like, I don't want to do that shit.
[337:46.83]Maybe my nephew will.
[337:55.93]She don't read are you serious?
[337:59.52]Alright, well I beat it and I did a couple of the sides I just then I know myself if I sit there for another fucking hour I'm gonna turn green
[338:26.77]So, here's the deal.
[338:29.75]Let's go over the rest of the week.
[338:33.57]Because, yeah, I got to take a break.
[338:34.93]I got to get out of here.
[338:37.11]I got to go, like, do an eye wash.
[338:39.01]I have to go do one of those chemical eye washes that are in your science class.
[338:51.02]So, the remainder of the week.
[338:53.63]I'm not going to be live tomorrow.
[338:56.47]I have a lot to do tomorrow.
[338:57.96]I've got much to do tomorrow.
[339:00.42]But we're going to go Friday, Saturday.
[339:03.90]And we'll see from there where we're going to go.
[339:07.76]Guess what?
[339:08.96]Guess what?
[339:11.31]The Dreamcast is actually going to happen this weekend.
[339:14.65]It actually is going to happen because it's already getting set up.
[339:18.67]It's already happening.
[339:21.27]Trust me.
[339:23.04]I promise that the Dreamcast stream will be on Saturday.
[339:29.35]Promise.
[339:29.67]100% promise.
[339:32.09]I probably should do this.
[339:35.14]But that was Celeste.
[339:36.96]It's a great game.
[339:37.96]It's very, very fun.
[339:40.78]If you like platforming games, it's fantastic.
[339:45.26]It's one of the better ones I've played in a long time.
[339:48.04]If you like hard, very, very hard excruciating stuff, it's in there.
[339:54.05]It's there.
[339:57.23]It's there.
[339:57.53]If you like hitting your face against a wall in a game for like two straight hours, you can do that.
[340:09.03]It's available.
[340:20.84]First impression?
[340:22.50]I would give it a solid... Mmm, wind gimmick, like, really brought it down, like, two or three full letter grades.
[340:30.18]Uh, I would give it, like, an S+.
[340:32.79]An S++.
[340:33.45]But the wind, uh, and, like, the moving objects, and, like, the going back and, like, moving that block back and forth brought that down, like, four letter grades.
[340:43.75]So I give it, like, I give it an A-.
[340:50.40]I'd give it like an AA, an 88.
[340:51.18]Or like a 90.
[340:51.42]Oh yeah, the YOLO 2.
[340:52.10]85.
[340:52.20]86.
[340:52.24]No, it's not an S++.
[340:53.59]It started in S++.
[340:56.61]Yeah, 88.
[340:56.89]I think, I think, no, 87. 87.
[341:24.93]But thank you for joining me on this... What do I look like right now?
[341:30.91]Let's see how I look.
[341:35.65]I look a little fucked up.
[341:39.68]That's just what happens when you play a game like this.
[341:44.60]He looks fucked.
[341:45.40]Yeah.
[341:46.02]How my eyes look.
[341:47.66]Can you see?
[342:05.86]He's blushing?
[342:06.70]No, that's a zit.
[342:09.76]I mean, it's not that big.
[342:10.82]It's right there, but it is.
[342:13.76]How do I not age?
[342:16.53]Just ask me tomorrow when I've aged like three cigarettes worth of years from the last like two hours of levels.
[342:23.81]But, uh, that's it.
[342:25.63]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[342:27.27]We'll go Friday, Saturday.
[342:30.58]And do some Dreamcast.
[342:31.80]There's something I want to do on Friday.
[342:33.07]Hopefully I can get it ready.
[342:34.93]Should be a lot of fun.
[342:37.42]Grow out your beard.
[342:38.12]I can't.
[342:38.92]Growing out the beard, it doesn't work.
[342:40.38]It just becomes this mess under here that I can't get rid of.
[342:44.46]And it becomes to a point where it's itchy.
[342:49.23]It's annoying.
[342:49.95]It just looks like there's dirt on my face.
[342:53.95]It looks like somebody just rubbed dirt all over here.
[342:56.39]Because I don't grow it here.
[342:58.21]I only grow it here and here.
[343:00.91]So, not going to happen.
[343:03.23]It's okay, though.
[343:05.56]Break the controller.
[343:07.44]This is the one I'm talking about right here.
[343:09.04]This is what I've been using.
[343:11.36]This guy right here.
[343:12.22]And yeah, look, I got some like gamer sweat all over the controls.
[343:15.91]I've been, look, I've been playing a tough game for two straight days.
[343:19.27]You gotta give me, hold on here.
[343:21.35]And yes, I need to cut my nails.
[343:22.59]I was doing gardening work today before the stream, alright?
[343:25.54]So I needed those nails to rip into the garden and tear out the weeds.
[343:37.20]We doing bits?
[343:37.74]Yeah.
[343:38.50]Yeah, I got time for bits.
[343:43.52]What's it doing right now?
[343:45.30]But thanks for joining me.
[343:46.07]It was heated.
[343:49.01]Heated gaming moments.
[343:50.09]Hopefully you had fun.
[343:53.17]It was very, very difficult, but very fun at the same time.
[343:56.38]Otherwise, I would not have been doing it.
[344:11.18]I'm not going to do that.
[344:12.86]Alright, anyways.
[344:14.30]See you guys on Friday.
[344:17.52]Celeste gets the recommended stamp of approval.
[344:19.60]There's a lot of content there.
[344:20.60]There's a lot of time to put into that game if you are so inclined to do so.
[344:27.55]It is there.
[344:29.11]But, thank you Topac for the $1.
[344:31.19]First cheer.
[344:33.35]Alec4x4, thanks for the $1.
[344:34.53]What's up, Jerma?
[344:35.35]I just got off work and I saw you were streaming.
[344:36.93]I just had to come in and say hello.
[344:38.15]Well, hello.
[344:41.19]Was this the last Celeste stream?
[344:43.75]Uh, yeah.
[344:46.61]Just because the only, I think, content that's really still available is those, like, really hard versions of everything.
[344:55.98]And I need to take, like, a break from it.
[344:58.62]I don't think I'll go back to it after the main story and the bonus chapter.
[345:07.69]Friday's stream is not going to be Celeste.
[345:10.64]It will not.
[345:20.97]But I still enjoyed my time in it, regardless if I stream it again.
[345:24.51]And yes, I made a few jokes about how I'm never going to open the game again.
[345:28.35]That might not necessarily be true.
[345:33.58]We'll see.
[345:35.19]I think it's already on the... It's already on the archive channel.
[345:36.91]I believe in its entirety.
[345:37.47]So it is, I think, currently preserved.
[346:08.23]At least from my understanding.
[346:12.26]What if the archive channel gets removed?
[346:15.66]Uh, that would be... That would be... Unfortunate, I guess.
[346:22.16]But, I'll save it.
[346:23.16]I'll just download it.
[346:27.46]It's not gonna be that hard for me to get it, so... But thank you, Sticky Brick.
[346:31.78]Thank you, Manboy, for the $1.
[346:33.04]Just remember that I've never shown you this.
[346:35.24]It's called Fired Man.
[346:40.35]Fired man.
[346:41.13]So there's just fireman without the fire.
[346:49.20]Thank you Topac for the two dollars.
[346:50.68]Imagine watching this with your grandkids.
[346:58.54]Oh!
[347:01.35]Oh, this is so fucking hard.
[347:05.93]Oh!
[347:06.81]Why would you watch this with your grandkids?
[347:09.79]And that, by the way, that wasn't even from today.
[347:14.23]That might have sounded like it was from tonight, but it wasn't.
[347:28.67]Thank you, Dork Cube, for the $1.
[347:30.75]I don't know why everyone tries to get you to say fucked up shit in these bits.
[347:34.85]It's just that I'm a...
[347:39.92]I've gotten a lot better at refraining.
[347:46.10]From saying.
[347:46.58]You know, I've gotten a lot better at finding what bits are trying to get me to say things that maybe shouldn't be read.
[347:55.58]Getting better at it.
[347:58.88]But thank you, Snooze and Copter, for the one dollar.
[348:00.43]Jerma, are you kidding?
[348:01.07]Your hair looks splendid.
[348:03.41]Splendid.
[348:06.67]Thank you, Snooze and Copter.
[348:13.27]I appreciate that.
[348:14.65]Devlon2million, thanks for the $10.
[348:16.11]Hey, Jay, my winter break ends today and I'm moving back into my dorm tomorrow.
[348:20.22]It's been great watching you again.
[348:22.08]You've helped me decompress after an emotionally taxing first semester of college, but I'm probably just being melodramatic.
[348:28.43]I wouldn't be keeping up as much as the semester goes on, so take some cash for a shitty $10 stream joke.
[348:44.47]Shitty $10 stream joke.
[348:46.09]No, there's no such thing as a shitty joke on this channel.
[348:50.61]There's only... Only good jokes.
[348:57.83]I'm gonna make... You want me to make Shido a bed and just have him be able to lie down in a bed over here?
[349:07.17]I think you kill code for the $1.
[349:09.15]Hey, Jerma, I just wanted you to watch this cool clip.
[349:11.20]Nothing weird about it.
[349:14.15]I bet.
[349:14.55]That's that one.
[349:40.51]It was... That was the joke.
[349:42.30]We had to get rid of the... We had to get rid of the gnomes.
[349:46.98]Does that make you feel better?
[350:02.34]Thank you, DoorCube, for the $3 since we're coming to the more emotional part of the game.
[350:05.92]I just want to say that when I played this game a year ago, I was really worried about going to college with my siblings moving away to the city.
[350:12.56]I felt really lost.
[350:13.70]I still sometimes worry about what the hell I'm going to do with my life.
[350:17.52]But after playing through this game, it made me realize that the end goal shouldn't get in the way of the here and the now.
[350:22.78]Climbing the mountain is important.
[350:25.28]Climbing the mountain is important, but you get there one jump at a time.
[350:29.33]This is true.
[350:33.05]Rome wasn't built in a day.
[350:38.48]It's a series of steps that you take up.
[350:46.46]That's it.
[350:49.77]Trying to do something in a second, or in a day, or a week.
[350:54.99]Life is a never-ending process.
[351:02.52]As my mother once said, the road to success is always under construction.
[351:18.72]Oh, what a cool mom.
[351:24.00]Thank you, DoorQ.
[351:27.36]But, yeah.
[351:33.02]It does speak... It does speak very, very soundly.
[351:39.56]On... You know, overcoming obstacles.
[351:46.90]Thank you for the $3.
[351:48.00]Thank you Divus for the $2.
[351:50.21]Appreciate it.
[352:02.41]$2 from Divis.
[352:02.81]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tim, for the $1.
[352:04.05]I would like to apologize for comparing Shito to my brother's kazoo.
[352:08.79]Shito is a beloved family member to you, and I see that now.
[352:11.97]Hope you and Shito can find it in your hearts to forgive me.
[352:15.09]No, don't worry.
[352:24.34]Thank you, Corsher, for the $2-$3 here.
[352:28.89]Just use an Xbox 360 or PS4 controller.
[352:31.03]Both feel much better than an Xbox One.
[352:35.28]No, it might even be my controller.
[352:36.78]There might be something wrong with it.
[352:39.04]I did, like, drop it in the bathtub, like, three times.
[352:41.18]It might have something to do with it.
[352:43.78]And the worst controller ever made was the GameCube and the N64 controller.
[352:51.90]I love the N64 controller.
[352:53.29]I think it's great.
[352:57.86]What was it doing near the bathtub?
[352:59.16]I was playing... I was really addicted to Binding of Isaac, and I was taking a bath, and I needed to keep playing, so I brought my entire computer into the bath.
[353:08.59]Like, the bathroom.
[353:10.05]Set it up.
[353:12.73]I used to do this, by the way.
[353:15.11]This might- you might think this is, like, funny and dumb and bullshit, but... I used to bring my computer into the bathroom, and go to the bathroom.
[353:22.51]I would sit on the toilet, and have it be on the computer.
[353:27.25]It was such an elaborate setup.
[353:36.26]Yeah, I've told you that before.
[353:42.68]And then you finish, you're done, and then you like sit there saying to yourself, oh man, I have to tear all this down and put it back where it belongs.
[354:01.02]That's impressive.
[354:03.23]I feel like you've wrote- I feel like you've wrote a message- Listen.
[354:13.31]I think you've wrote a message talking about how I'm right once in my life like 30 times.
[354:19.60]So am I right once?
[354:21.82]Or am I right 30 times?
[354:29.13]What happens when you write once in your life a shitload of times?
[354:33.23]Doesn't that mean that you're kind of right sometimes?
[354:35.69]30 is way too low.
[354:48.52]Yeah, I'm talking about this week.
[354:51.67]Hey, it's time for slime.
[354:52.41]Thanks for the $1.
[354:53.01]Hey, Jerma, I made you a cool treasure map.
[354:57.52]The old backseating treasure map.
[355:00.46]Oh god.
[355:01.02]Hold on.
[355:01.44]Let's look at this.
[355:08.31]Hold on.
[355:09.37]I gotta put this on screen.
[355:13.31]This is great.
[355:22.05]Let's see it.
[355:29.02]Okay, so... Let's look.
[355:34.00]The old chat backseating treasure map.
[355:38.30]Okay, so, start here.
[355:41.18]There is a secret here that you should know about.
[355:44.40]Well, I didn't, I, uh, okay.
[355:46.52]Okay, again, it's that next spot.
[355:47.92]Turn right, idiot.
[355:49.12]Here we go, let's keep going.
[355:52.22]Blame controller here.
[355:54.64]Wrong, jebaited.
[355:57.20]Toxic chat swamp just go Why haven't you found it yet treasure and we're going to Utah This is great I'm gonna frame this and put it on my desk
[356:29.98]Thank you for that.
[356:30.48]That gave me a nice little chuckle.
[356:34.20]Captain Worgen, thanks for the $1.
[356:35.56]Everything you say statistically has a 0.8% chance to become a meme.
[356:39.26]I don't know about everything.
[356:51.73]Maybe 0.8% of the things I say have a 0.8% chance to become a meme.
[356:59.21]Hey, Dork Cube, thanks for the $1.
[357:00.47]This stream brought to you by Mad Catz Controllers.
[357:02.53]Mad Catz, at least we know how to make a D-pad.
[357:10.78]This stream really was.
[357:11.78]Well, the last two streams were just the quintessential blame the controller.
[357:16.42]It's the controller.
[357:17.80]It's the controller, but it was.
[357:20.78]It was.
[357:22.60]Trust me.
[357:28.03]I know that in quotes, it's the controller, end quote, is the cheap, easy way for somebody to tell you why they're doing something wrong.
[357:44.69]It's the controller.
[357:50.75]It's not me that sucks.
[357:52.39]It's everything else.
[358:06.38]Controller can.
[358:09.96]May as well blame lag while you're at it.
[358:11.64]Well, I can't blame lag.
[358:12.72]Because it's not connected to the internet.
[358:15.20]I would've.
[358:16.66]If there was an opportunity when I fell off the ledge or something, I would... Oh, yeah.
[358:20.02]I got like 200 ping.
[358:21.73]It's impossible.
[358:22.33]It's unplayable.
[358:23.37]I would've done it.
[358:24.79]I absolutely would've done it.
[358:26.99]Would've done it.
[358:27.65]Would've done it.
[358:28.09]It's like not rolling off my tongue that well for some reason.
[358:31.73]Hey, Dorkcube.
[358:32.51]Thank you, but you just said the mad cats thing.
[358:34.51]Thank you.
[358:36.80]Thank you, Genieboy, for the $1.
[358:38.52]Checkmate, those who say jermaMustard isn't an instrument.
[358:44.35]An instrument?
[358:44.97]What do you mean, an instrument?
[358:52.08]Thank you, Corsher, for the $2 or $3 here.
[358:54.92]It's like you really want to wake up SEGA and Shito.
[358:57.46]Stop yelling.
[359:01.76]Well, the SEGA's not alive.
[359:03.20]Shito is.
[359:08.94]And then, of course, you're with another couple of dollars here.
[359:11.34]Here, take my money.
[359:12.04]That's all my bits.
[359:12.89]I'm broke now.
[359:15.69]I hope that's not true.
[359:18.07]So I get, you know, old 90s shows, but what about early and mid cartoons like Samurai Jack, Danny Phantom, Star Wars Clone Wars?
[359:28.84]It's actually pretty interesting that I have never seen any of those.
[359:33.62]I've not seen Samurai Jack.
[359:35.16]I've not seen Danny Phantom.
[359:36.44]Well, I've seen it on the TV accidentally.
[359:40.32]flipping through.
[359:41.62]And I've not watched the original Star Wars Clone Wars animated series.
[359:48.11]I have not.
[359:49.39]Sorry.
[359:50.93]Hey, Rapid Wave, thanks for the five dollars.
[359:53.80]Captain Worgen, thanks for the one dollar.
[359:55.30]There's an image here.
[359:58.10]It's another controller.
[360:05.61]Yes, I'm well aware that my drawing of the controller looks like an enemy from Undertale.
[360:11.60]I get it.
[360:18.52]But it's okay.
[360:24.08]Thank you, Captain Morgan.
[360:24.80]Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the $1.
[360:26.12]Just curious, what are your thoughts on the new Spider-Man Far From Home trailer?
[360:31.37]I really don't know what to even think because it seems like a lot going on.
[360:37.11]Spider-Man takes a trip to Europe.
[360:40.09]There's a water monster that comes out.
[360:45.72]And then Jake Gyllenhaal slams down with green acid around him.
[360:52.20]And says, get out of here, kids.
[360:53.56]I don't know.
[361:01.94]I mean, homecoming was really well-received and really great, right?
[361:08.64]We'll have to see.
[361:15.45]What do you mean, no?
[361:18.93]Homecoming was very well-received, wasn't it?
[361:27.25]Uh, thank you, Dork Cube, for the one dollar.
[361:29.11]Jerma, yesterday, you sick fucks ru-ru-stop.
[361:34.34]What?
[361:35.20]You sick fuck- you sick fucks need to stop talking about farts, Jerma.
[361:38.63]Today, I'm gonna pee all over the controller.
[361:44.86]Yeah, but I was saying that out of frustration.
[361:47.76]You weren't saying... You were saying, I love this stream, I can't... You know what I mean?
[361:52.93]That was not out of frustration.
[361:55.29]You were just saying it because you wanted to say that.
[361:57.43]Because you thought it was fun to say that.
[362:03.02]I wasn't doing that having fun.
[362:05.50]I was going to piss on the controller.
[362:07.66]Out of anger.
[362:08.00]Out of anger.
[362:10.62]It wasn't, I'm having so much fun, I'm gonna pee on the controller.
[362:13.94]You wouldn't do that.
[362:15.12]You'd only do that out of pure frustration.
[362:21.53]I'm not gonna pee on the controller.
[362:24.97]I'm just gonna put it in the blender and put it on the ice crush setting.
[362:35.36]You know how powerful that is?
[362:37.80]The ice crush shedding in your blood, that's more powerful than a superhero.
[362:45.36]I don't know.
[362:46.00]I'm tired.
[362:53.52]Thank you, Compact Viewer, for the $3.
[362:55.20]Wow, I joined at the right fucking end.
[362:58.12]Late viewer.
[363:00.76]Just at the end.
[363:01.62]Oh, you said that three hours ago.
[363:02.82]We're still here.
[363:04.59]Was I gonna end the stream three hours ago?
[363:06.31]Holy shit.
[363:07.07]Did I really get that mad?
[363:10.13]Alright, so we got a scale here.
[363:11.55]I'm gonna give you guys a scale.
[363:14.59]Um... We've got... Personal- Personal anger.
[363:20.10]And annoyance, right?
[363:22.12]With like, my self- We got Skate 3 kind of somewhere there.
[363:26.34]Where was this on the scale of like, Skate 3 to Hotline Miami 2?
[363:34.33]You know, like, Skate 3 is angry.
[363:36.99]Actually, that's two different scales.
[363:38.53]Let's go, what's like the best stream, like the most fun, relaxing stream I've ever done?
[363:42.67]Labo.
[363:49.66]From Labo to Hotline Miami 2, where does this sit?
[364:01.84]Labo is not relaxing.
[364:04.81]This was a little under Mario Tennis.
[364:07.69]I don't know about that.
[364:08.53]I remember Mario Tennis being actually truly angry and being upset.
[364:21.47]Almost Mario Tennis.
[364:22.93]No way this is near Mario Tennis.
[364:27.95]Mario Tennis was traumatizing.
[364:34.95]Uh, that's live.
[364:37.49]That's live TV, guys.
[364:43.25]There ain't no going back.
[364:44.91]I can't pretend like that never happened.
[364:46.57]This is real, live, raw Jeremy.
[364:50.13]I can't, what am I, I can't, I just, sometimes it happens.
[365:02.88]You don't want to put on a face and pretend, no.
[365:07.44]I'm not capable.
[365:08.10]It's just me.
[365:11.86]But thank you, Breenbin, for the $5.
[365:14.18]Congratulations on climbing the mountain.
[365:15.54]Hope you gain some pro gamer skills along the way.
[365:17.70]Like an hour or two later, that might have been a debate there.
[365:22.13]Goosecap, thanks for the $1.
[365:23.43]Hey Jerma, you're one of my favorite content creators and I love your streams.
[365:26.39]Also, I made another baseball-related green screen video.
[365:30.16]I actually saw this.
[365:31.94]I saw this, didn't I?
[365:37.08]No, I didn't.
[365:37.48]Where's the one with just the bases clearing drawl?
[365:42.58]Let's watch this one.
[365:44.26]Not for the encore night!
[365:45.29]The encore night.
[365:46.49]Ugh.
[365:50.13]We're gonna do this soon.
[365:51.41]Probably very soon.
[365:55.58]These are fucking funny, and... I'm not supposed to be doing this!
[366:00.70]I'm not supposed to be showing green screen stuff!
[366:04.40]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[366:06.16]There's another one of these that has a basis-clearing fucking brawl, and I was laughing my ass off at it.
[366:16.02]Left field!
[366:17.22]And the Red Sox are winners!
[366:25.44]Manny Ramirez with an absolute rocket into the Boston night.
[366:30.49]And the Red Sox lead the series two games to none.
[366:34.94]That's it.
[366:36.08]The at-bat the Red Sox have looked for.
[366:51.41]I love those.
[366:52.93]I did so many baseball swings and baseball things.
[366:59.69]Show the other one.
[367:00.49]Ah, where is it?
[367:01.23]Does somebody have the other one where there's a basis clearing brawl?
[367:10.79]What gaming chair did you use for that home run?
[367:14.62]One, I got it from like this door.
[367:24.11]I did the Ortiz Grand Slam also.
[367:27.86]Those are all so good.
[367:30.70]But thank you for that.
[367:31.76]Thank you, GooseCab.
[367:33.14]Ultralaven, thanks for the $1.
[367:34.42]Although you did not stick with the original title idea of what is inside the cube, I forgive you and wanted to actually thank you for the incredible streams you provided me and countless others with.
[367:47.21]I try.
[367:48.93]I'm trying.
[367:51.39]I hope it's fun.
[367:52.23]Thank you.
[367:55.70]babby babby ty thanks for the 11 do you think your pac-man will come out of ranked retirement it's possible it's very possible
[368:19.52]I still have the... I don't have the actual... Do I even have?
[368:23.28]I have the suit.
[368:25.94]But I don't think I have the face.
[368:29.40]I think I might have gotten lost in the move.
[368:34.06]But thank you for the $11.
[368:35.64]Smellyboy, thanks for $1.
[368:36.86]You should play Civ VI.
[368:40.76]I'm not sure I'm cut out for that.
[368:43.38]Seems really interesting.
[368:44.98]But I'm not sure I'm capable.
[368:48.43]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[368:49.85]What's with the physics for scientists and engineers with modern physics joke the chat keeps making?
[368:58.43]I don't know.
[369:03.45]What is it?
[369:06.08]I didn't see it.
[369:07.52]Hey, Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the $2.
[369:09.08]Hey, Jerma, today's the 10th anniversary of Meet the Heavy, which means 10 years without a Meet the Heavy Jerma dub.
[369:16.52]If you don't want to dub it and just show it.
[369:20.14]And there's a gnome here.
[369:21.38]I'm too tired to do a dub right now.
[369:40.15]No down under.
[369:52.83]What have we done as a society?
[369:54.55]You know what I mean?
[369:56.27]Think about that.
[369:57.41]This is a clickable link.
[370:01.35]Do you understand, guys?
[370:03.41]What's happening?
[370:04.95]This is a clickable- This is something that- This is a link.
[370:08.37]You know, I... I... What's next?
[370:32.19]I can't believe that that's even possible to do.
[370:34.76]The world has progressed so quickly.
[370:39.18]We just made up the TV like 60 or 70 years ago.
[370:48.60]The color TV.
[370:51.28]And now people can sync the gnome to a song of their choosing.
[371:08.55]That's truly unbelievable.
[371:09.63]Where are we gonna be in 30 years?
[371:10.89]Are they gonna be flying gnomes in 30 years?
[371:15.65]Not even cars.
[371:16.89]We'll figure out how to fly gnomes before the car takes off the ground.
[371:25.15]Thank you, Mandum Requiem, for the two dollars.
[371:27.99]Thank you.
[371:30.01]Thank you, Binko, for the one dollar.
[371:32.29]Had to give you a dollar to tell you that there are golden strawberries for completing a chapter without dying.
[371:38.24]and I have gotten 15 of them.
[371:42.91]Some for A-side, some for C-side.
[371:44.55]Nonetheless, you've been making progress faster than I initially did, so you're doing incredibly well.
[371:52.09]Thank you.
[371:52.75]That's... I don't know how it's... you can do that.
[371:57.79]It's so... I told you, some of you guys, uh, have like this, like, alien video game IQ.
[372:09.49]It's like otherworldly how good some of you guys are at these games.
[372:13.81]Otherworldly.
[372:15.11]Not even Earth.
[372:23.38]But thank you.
[372:25.02]That sounds really intense.
[372:26.90]And it sounds like something I would probably never do.
[372:30.00]I do appreciate the fact that it's available.
[372:33.17]And I do respect the fact that people are capable of doing that.
[372:36.85]So...
[372:39.69]Cheers to that.
[372:57.49]It's this fun, really fun mechanic called Stuff Grows Out After You Touch Wall.
[373:05.33]It's the funnest fucking mechanic in the game.
[373:08.19]It's my favorite.
[373:09.77]Have I told you about my favorite, sweetie?
[373:12.44]It's the best.
[373:24.02]What are you... Whoa, what is this?
[373:27.23]here's another one to the whiskey a couple of doubles last night he's hitting 10 straight and he hits it right back at Jose
[374:08.03]He's just so good.
[374:09.87]He's a... He's just so good.
[374:10.63]He's actually so good.
[374:12.71]This shush.
[374:13.51]And he hits it right back at Jose.
[374:41.89]Imagine if a motherfucker did this shit and hit it out of the park Can you imagine like the living shitpost you would be if you tried to do this?
[375:01.82]You guys are fucking too funny What if it worked?
[375:10.15]I'm so glad.
[375:11.05]You guys are so fucking funny.
[375:21.45]Hey, CKLuck, thank you for the one dollar.
[375:24.18]Jerma next, Jerma next, Jerma next, Jerma next.
[375:29.58]When are we gonna get the encore movie night?
[375:33.80]Probably very soon.
[375:36.18]I want to give enough details.
[375:38.02]So there's like a week to kind of compile them, maybe a little bit more.
[375:41.36]Because the mods did so much last time.
[375:46.18]I'd like to give a lot of time to make it work.
[375:53.91]But thank you.
[375:55.27]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1 stream.
[375:57.21]The cook food.
[375:59.53]Oh, that's right.
[375:59.97]I said all I do is stream and then go cook food for 12 hours.
[376:03.03]I don't even know what that meant.
[376:05.31]It was just steam coming out of my eyes.
[376:06.77]No.
[376:08.25]Sorry.
[376:08.51]Shido is gonna be given the... Shido's gonna be the... What's it called?
[376:11.76]The... eulogy?
[376:12.38]At the funeral?
[376:29.61]The pallbearer?
[376:30.47]He can't hold the casket.
[376:49.39]CK, luck again, thanks for the $1.
[376:50.99]If you have not pre-recorded a stream yet to play in like two years from now, referencing old jokes and shit, you're missing an opportunity.
[376:58.07]Imagine you streaming like the launch build of No Man's Sky and talking about like JermaCraft and Rewind to Flanker and old stream jokes.
[377:06.13]It would be amazing.
[377:09.22]I actually, there was something I was going to do a while ago where I was, it was going to be too much, but it might have been worth it.
[377:19.75]I was going to pre-record like seven streams and then just play them all back to back to back to back to back to back and go on vacation and see if anybody figured it out.
[377:38.32]and put pictures on Twitter of being somewhere where it's very far away?
[377:47.18]Like, how would I get back to my house and stream?
[377:52.64]Where even is he?
[377:54.84]We would find out in two minutes.
[377:58.44]What if this is one of the streams I prerecorded?
[378:01.35]That's right.
[378:02.29]Now you're thinking with portals.
[378:05.70]I thought about it though.
[378:06.48]It just that means I have to do seven full live streams and not stream them.
[378:11.86]You know, I would have to turn on a stream but not actually broadcast it and just stream for like six hours.
[378:31.60]But think of the free time.
[378:34.28]No, I've got lots of free time.
[378:37.96]I mean, I would consider myself busy.
[378:41.89]I try to keep up and try to plan things and do things.
[378:45.61]And this is like a lot of like real life stuff that I, you know, have to do.
[378:50.65]I stay fairly busy.
[378:54.27]But it's not like I have zero free time.
[379:01.36]Hey, Yebso, thanks for the $4.
[379:03.10]All jokes aside, please don't overwork yourself.
[379:05.08]I would hate to see you have an early streamer burnout.
[379:08.49]You're my favorite internet boy.
[379:09.67]Please stay safe.
[379:10.49]I'm just fine.
[379:13.47]Don't confuse frustrated with video game with frustrated with livestream.
[379:21.53]You know?
[379:21.93]Those are two completely different things.
[379:25.81]Frustrated in playing video game has nothing to do with broadcasting stream.
[379:43.71]I'm not that that doesn't I don't think that's ever I don't think that's happened I'm not sure that actually that has happened I don't think I've ever gotten to a point where I've been like annoyed at the stream like at streaming or being live or being recorded or I'm not sure
[380:17.80]You don't have to put on a persona, which really must make it easier.
[380:23.64]Um... Yeah, I'm... I don't know if it's necessarily a persona thing as much as it's... Look, I get pissed off at fucking stuff all the time.
[380:34.19]I'm a fairly... I'm a fairly, like, laid-back person.
[380:38.11]But I can get red-hot about random stuff.
[380:42.95]And energized, right?
[380:46.06]But not at... I love streaming.
[380:49.48]I think it's one of the most engaging, fun things.
[380:53.34]It interests me every time.
[380:54.56]I'm not sure there's been... It's been very few times, if at all.
[381:14.69]And I, you know, it happens.
[381:17.97]I can't tell you guys that I'm some perfect pinnacle of, you know, collected, being collected all the time.
[381:24.80]I'm just like, I'm a person just like anybody else.
[381:28.14]Sometimes I have a bad day, sometimes I have really good days, sometimes, you know, you gotta really, sometimes you have a bad stream, sometimes you're off.
[381:34.72]It can happen.
[381:36.80]I'm not gonna pretend like it doesn't, right?
[381:40.42]Not like today, I mean, it's not like it was, that was today.
[381:47.44]But it's... I'm not gonna pretend like it's otherwise.
[381:51.98]Because pretending otherwise means that I'm not like a person.
[381:55.37]Nope!
[381:55.97]Every single day we're having so much fun and every day is just welcome to the stream!
[382:00.71]Like, that's not reality.
[382:08.06]I didn't know that streamers were human.
[382:15.10]That sounds so much better.
[382:17.70]How quickly would people leave if I was like that every second?
[382:32.31]I don't think I would be able to handle it.
[382:39.19]Do the YouTuber voice stream for six hours.
[382:41.49]I wouldn't be able to do that.
[382:45.10]I almost left right there.
[382:46.12]Alright, what's worse?
[382:49.97]Being frustrated and dying a hundred times at the same level and being angry and talking shit about like the clouds or the YouTuber voice?
[382:56.87]I'm having tons of fun pretending.
[383:01.89]Which one?
[383:02.65]I feel like that's like their opposite ends of the spectrum there.
[383:18.17]That's where my love of the stream comes from.
[383:19.61]You always stay grounded.
[383:20.59]You always stay real.
[383:24.13]Because... Yeah, I... I don't know.
[383:27.85]It's hard to... You can't put on... I don't know.
[383:32.40]It's impossible.
[383:33.96]Maybe for some people, but not for me.
[383:35.56]I can't put on a fucking personality for seven straight hours.
[383:39.56]It's been six and a half hours.
[383:41.54]Right?
[383:44.52]At some point, that becomes exhausting.
[383:49.53]Even more so than anything else, right?
[384:05.00]I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss the old Jerma985 cut-down edit styles of videos you did yourself, but the stream is great.
[384:14.46]Yeah, but...
[384:16.66]I don't think very much has changed.
[384:18.66]It's just the format has.
[384:19.61]In regards to how I go about doing things.
[384:36.31]I wanted to keep the same kind of energy level and the same attitude that I had in my videos.
[384:45.36]I made the videos the same way.
[384:47.50]You wanna know?
[384:47.86]Here's the difference, guys.
[384:48.80]Ready?
[384:49.14]You wanna know the big difference between making a YouTube video and streaming?
[384:53.36]You're here watching me record the game.
[384:57.29]That's really the only difference, and I'm not editing it afterwards.
[385:02.35]I mean, they do get put into highlights, and they do get edited down for a second Jerma.
[385:09.56]But if I was not streaming, let's say for instance Celeste, right?
[385:13.54]If I wasn't not streaming Celeste and I thought it would make a fun video, I would have just done what you just watched.
[385:22.30]But it's almost easier now, because there are people here...
[385:27.22]that can react in real time.
[385:30.02]And can see it in real time.
[385:32.10]And we can talk about it in real time.
[385:33.60]We can laugh about something in real time.
[385:35.14]Somebody can say something that's really funny.
[385:39.00]Maybe I will say something, and then people react to it, and we can go off from there.
[385:42.60]I love that back and forth.
[385:46.54]The whole, like, treasure map thing earlier?
[385:48.49]That was... I loved that.
[385:50.73]That was a lot of fun.
[385:52.37]That doesn't happen if...
[385:56.01]I'm alone in the room recording by myself.
[386:06.55]And the in-person skits.
[386:07.63]I mean, those really haven't necessarily stopped either.
[386:13.56]Think of some of the streams that I've done over the last six to twelve months.
[386:17.70]That have had just kind of just skits, like jokes.
[386:24.30]You know, like the lie detector, the dinner, even like the Christmas Eve stream, the New Year's Eve stream.
[386:30.61]Those are all bits that took a while to set up.
[386:34.61]Wasn't like I just figured that out and did that in one day.
[386:48.58]The lie detector was a joke?
[386:50.80]Well, I mean, the stream... I really did that.
[386:55.04]I was really hooked up to a fucking lie detector.
[386:59.20]But that stream was a... It was just for fun.
[387:03.36]It was just like a thing to do.
[387:05.62]That wasn't just... It was a skit.
[387:09.64]It was a thing.
[387:10.28]It was like a comedy, right?
[387:12.36]It was, hey, I'm gonna get this guy to come and give me a lie detector test.
[387:16.30]Isn't that fun?
[387:23.41]He's a liar.
[387:31.92]Did the doctor watch the VOD?
[387:33.92]Oh, Dr. Schmikeson?
[387:41.90]I feel like YouTube is harder because you have no one to interact with.
[387:49.47]I do like, but I also love making videos.
[387:54.60]I do like it.
[387:56.07]It's fun to do.
[387:58.75]But it's hard to do them both.
[388:02.49]Because, see, like, for instance, I streamed for seven to eight hours yesterday, wanted to take a break, got tired, and, you know, ate some food and relaxed and then went to bed.
[388:12.14]Kind of the same thing, like, today, right?
[388:13.68]So another day goes by, here we are.
[388:16.22]Six, seven hours go by, you know, I want to get food and relax, I don't really want to go, like, make a video after that.
[388:23.44]You know, after sitting and doing stuff for 6, 7, 8, sometimes 10 plus hours, the next day, if I'm going to take a day off, is a lot of it is what do I want to do for the stream coming up?
[388:36.93]Are there any upcoming streams that I want to try to start working on?
[388:39.65]Is there anything fun that I want to try to get ready?
[388:42.69]It kind of takes up a majority of the time.
[388:51.24]Plus, we've talked about the YouTube changes and all the... How YouTube has kind of ran itself into the ground over the last couple of years anyways.
[389:03.37]But... We'll move on.
[389:06.85]Not to go down that rabbit hole again.
[389:16.93]But that was Yebso for $4 talking about don't overwork yourself.
[389:21.23]I'm not.
[389:22.31]Don't worry about me.
[389:26.19]And again, I'm going to reiterate that one more time.
[389:30.97]Don't take frustrating video game and back and forth kind of jokey banter with the chat with I'm not having a good time streaming.
[389:41.43]They're very different things.
[389:44.03]Just want to make sure that's very, very clear.
[389:48.12]uh thank you to ck luck again for the one dollar hey Jerma if someone managed to acquire a sample of your dna and cloned you do you we already went over that no I someone some with uh you're asking like alright um thank you future gamer for the two dollars
[390:13.47]So in like five years, what will your acceptance speech for the number one top streamer on Twitch award be?
[390:20.83]You know what it'd be?
[390:23.57]This is not my award.
[390:28.43]I want to give this to chat.
[390:31.51]Because they're the reason why I'm here.
[390:38.45]And I would donate it.
[390:42.01]Melt the fucking gold down and donate it.
[390:52.37]And then I would laugh my ass off and be like, I'm just kidding.
[390:55.76]This is mine.
[390:59.08]Chat sucks.
[390:59.94]Chat sucks.
[391:00.80]Chat sucks.
[391:01.78]And the whole audience would be chanting.
[391:05.76]I would just start fucking screaming it.
[391:11.02]They would cut to George Clooney in the audience.
[391:12.66]He'd be like, Jack Socks!
[391:14.02]Jack Socks!
[391:14.92]I'd laugh like a huge smile on his face.
[391:18.77]And I'd walk down the aisle and every single fucking row is high-fiving me.
[391:23.43]Every single one.
[391:30.13]And then you wake up from your fucking nightmare.
[391:32.96]Wow, I fell asleep at the award show because all award shows are fucking boring and horrible.
[391:36.64]What is stupid?
[391:38.08]Oh, no, he's doing his acceptance speech.
[391:41.18]And I would, and what would happen is, I would give it to chat.
[391:54.17]Hey, future gamer, thanks for the two dollars.
[391:56.43]That was you.
[391:57.87]That's it, though.
[392:01.91]Hey, bro luck, thanks.
[392:03.13]We have to stop the future, the premonition that we saw.
[392:11.55]My god, thank you bro luck for the $1.
[392:13.61]What's your political opinion on politics?
[392:25.08]That's what I think hey compact viewer thanks for the $1.
[392:27.34]Thanks for the great stream as always Jerma keep cranking out the good content dash a fan Thank you, thank you compact viewer Thank You tingy for the $1.
[392:37.90]Thank you sticks renegade for the $1.
[392:38.93]Oh
[392:40.71]Thank you, Corsair, for the $1.
[392:43.13]Turns out I still had one more dollar, so a quick question.
[392:45.33]Do you still use your Steam community or no?
[392:49.17]No.
[392:50.61]Not at all.
[392:52.24]Steam community is going the same route as the Facebook, which is it may become auto-deleted because I have not touched it.
[393:02.34]That's where we are right now.
[393:04.72]Facebook might get auto-deleted because I haven't logged in in like fucking two years.
[393:09.71]The Steam group!
[393:10.83]I auto-deleted because I haven't used it in two... I have no idea.
[393:18.98]I came to this realization real quick that I don't do social media.
[393:21.92]I don't use it.
[393:25.56]I don't... I don't have... You know what?
[393:27.40]And it's not because... Oh, I know.
[393:29.57]Here come... Here come the boomer emotes, right?
[393:32.23]It has nothing to do with that.
[393:34.65]I just don't... I don't have much to say on those platforms.
[393:42.85]You know, I don't have very much to say.
[393:46.80]Talking about maybe a stream change or a schedule announcement or a stream announcement or something that I thought was interesting once in a while.
[393:57.14]But I'm not going to tweet you guys like a selfie of me eating like a fucking hamburger or something.
[394:03.22]What the hell?
[394:04.98]Why would I do that?
[394:07.96]What am I like looking for likes or retweets or something?
[394:10.74]What's the point of that?
[394:12.74]You know?
[394:13.20]I don't... I just don't do the social media thing.
[394:16.28]I never did, and I still really don't.
[394:20.71]Why not?
[394:23.83]We want that.
[394:24.71]Do it.
[394:25.17]I want that.
[394:25.79]Do it.
[394:28.49]I would enjoy seeing you enjoy a burger.
[394:36.22]Ah, alright.
[394:37.28]You ready for me to get real?
[394:38.52]Uh-oh.
[394:41.04]Uh-oh.
[394:44.17]Uh-oh.
[394:51.40]You want your privacy.
[394:52.68]I mean, it's kind of a privacy thing because, you know, not everything has to be shared.
[395:05.41]We're in this kind of weird mode where everything has to be shared and you have to share everything with everybody.
[395:11.58]This is what I did.
[395:12.36]This is where I went.
[395:13.16]This is what I ate.
[395:14.00]This is what I did today.
[395:14.76]This is what I'm doing tomorrow.
[395:15.58]This is what I did right now.
[395:17.76]Just a constant stream of sharing everything.
[395:28.03]It's weird how it's now kind of nice to not share something.
[395:38.53]That's kind of the other way around 10, 20 years ago.
[395:46.26]You told everyone you pee in the shower.
[395:48.42]On Twitter?
[395:55.23]When did I do that?
[395:59.83]He's keeping secrets from us.
[396:03.37]No.
[396:04.94]Like, another thing too is, like, let's say, for instance, right?
[396:09.46]If I was going somewhere, I was doing something...
[396:14.43]I think part of me, if I'm doing something like really, really fun or something really cool.
[396:20.66]Hey guys, look at how cool I am.
[396:22.14]Look at the cool thing I'm doing right now.
[396:24.10]You're not doing that.
[396:26.12]It's like, part of me is just like, I don't really like want to share it.
[396:31.81]Oh, look at how awesome this is.
[396:34.27]Don't you think I'm awesome?
[396:37.45]And I know that's not what a ton of people think when they're posting on social media, but I just, it itches in the back of my head.
[396:48.50]It really is like a look at me.
[396:50.68]Sometimes.
[396:54.85]All I want is a selfie with your Big Mac.
[397:06.08]Streamer has lice.
[397:14.98]If it's so cool, why are you worrying about posting?
[397:19.76]People like seeing people they care about succeed.
[397:23.38]Yeah.
[397:27.04]No, I get it.
[397:28.19]I just don't... I don't want to, like, brag to you guys for something.
[397:38.41]I just find it unnecessary.
[397:45.76]Succeeding in eating a burger.
[397:57.76]Jerma's withholding all of his cool shit from us.
[398:00.37]And that's part two.
[398:03.85]Uh-oh.
[398:04.53]Are we still live?
[398:05.69]Yeah.
[398:06.76]Uh, that's part two.
[398:09.48]I don't, uh... I don't do very much cool shit.
[398:15.58]You know what I mean?
[398:16.16]It's not like I'm, oh, by the way, today, I am here.
[398:19.13]And then tomorrow, look at me, I'm on top of a mountain.
[398:22.07]And hey, look at me, look at this, look where I am.
[398:24.17]Oh, I'm at the premiere of this movie.
[398:26.59]I don't, what?
[398:33.29]If I tweeted every day, three, four, five times a day, I'd be like on the couch.
[398:38.94]Sitting there like watching TV.
[398:51.56]Upload the same photo of you on your couch every day as a new tweet.
[398:57.40]And just give it a different tagline.
[398:59.86]Like, hey, I'm checking out the new Star Wars premiere.
[399:02.91]And it's me on the couch.
[399:07.29]Dude, I found the sickest restaurant in Vegas.
[399:10.29]I'm here at blah, blah, blah.
[399:11.49]It's the same picture.
[399:29.44]And one of them is just hanging out on the couch, taking a little snooze day.
[399:32.95]You know what I mean?
[399:33.39]Hashtag snooze day.
[399:34.51]And it's that's the, that's the correct tweet.
[399:37.05]That's going to be like eight tweets later though.
[399:53.06]You better do this.
[399:56.52]Get myself in fucking trouble.
[399:59.61]I'm gonna tweet out about how I met the Star Wars premiere, and like, Disney's gonna send a message like, We are in no way affiliated with Jerma985.
[400:06.75]He was not invited to the red carpet premiere.
[400:18.48]Wait, are we... Am I still alive?
[400:19.90]Yeah, we're getting some bad frame bullshit.
[400:23.68]Late night cocks problems.
[400:25.24]That's true.
[400:34.35]Thank you, IamMonk, for the one dollar.
[400:36.17]Uh, say Tupac.
[400:37.73]You know, like the rapper.
[400:38.93]Good.
[400:39.29]Now say Topac.
[400:41.39]See what you're doing wrong.
[400:55.31]Thank you, IamMonk.
[400:56.79]And, uh, thanks for the hundred dollars.
[401:00.97]Cor... Cormac McCarthy.
[401:05.24]Just give a hundred bucks and there's no message.
[401:07.80]Just a shitload of bits.
[401:08.88]A ton of them.
[401:13.28]Thank you so much.
[401:17.64]For the hundred dollars.
[401:19.22]Ten thousand bits.
[401:26.83]Really appreciate it.
[401:27.55]Thank you.
[401:27.85]It's a lot of fucking money.
[401:41.53]There's a grillmaster imposter in chat.
[401:45.83]Read the message.
[401:46.70]No, there's no message.
[401:48.28]Just cheer 10,000.
[401:49.02]There's no message here.
[401:52.00]Thank you.
[401:54.34]You are too kind to me.
[401:55.74]Seriously.
[402:01.60]Bring back the schedule.
[402:02.92]I'm not going to bring back the schedule.
[402:06.72]We're getting more streams more often.
[402:12.53]And it gives me a lot of opportunity to change each week to exactly how I want the week to go.
[402:23.17]Sorry, we're going to schedule this for a while.
[402:26.37]It may even be scheduled as permanently.
[402:36.62]Your tone whenever you get big bits is like you're addressing someone whose dog just died.
[402:49.66]It's a very grounding like humbling thing Somebody just gave me a hundred dollars.
[402:56.02]You know what I mean?
[402:56.74]It's like I I don't know how to react.
[402:59.40]It's it's a lot I Mean could I be like
[403:06.11]A HUNDRED DOLLARS!
[403:07.51]WOOO!
[403:09.61]WHAT THE FUCK?!
[403:11.01]HUNDRED!
[403:12.19]HEY!
[403:13.33]YEAH!
[403:21.33]I feel like that's not as genuine as how I would really react to it and it's- I'm shocked, I'm floored, I'm surprised.
[403:31.33]When it happens, when people give $100, $50.
[403:37.32]Thank you.
[403:37.72]I don't really have a reaction.
[403:40.18]I don't know how to react.
[403:41.44]Because it's a lot of money.
[403:47.02]Someone take that out of context and make him look terrible.
[403:54.87]Brag about the $100 on Twitter on the couch in the same selfie.
[404:03.61]You should dance for it.
[404:04.85]No, because I don't want to give incentives for it.
[404:09.76]If I, okay, if I, here, listen.
[404:13.75]How come you don't, like, make a huge deal when somebody gives, like, a bunch of money?
[404:17.79]Because then that incentivizes, oh, if I give him $100, he's gonna do a Fortnite dance on camera.
[404:26.62]You know, I want that to be genuine.
[404:28.22]I don't want that to be something that people are paying for because they know they're gonna get something.
[404:32.98]I'm gonna do something crazy, right?
[404:47.73]Because then, if that would happen... Let's say I said... By the way, this is not fucking real.
[404:55.22]I'm just saying this as a character in my own TV show.
[405:00.64]Okay?
[405:01.64]If I were to say... For the next 30 minutes, if I get a $100 donation, I will dance like crazy on stream.
[405:13.57]It would probably happen.
[405:14.29]It would probably happen at least a few times, at least.
[405:18.76]I don't want to tell people to donate, to give money.
[405:22.58]I don't want to tell you to do that, because that's your decision.
[405:26.36]It should be something that you make.
[405:27.76]Your decision.
[405:29.74]Words are difficult, is what I'm trying to say.
[405:31.58]It's hard to say words, especially in a sentence.
[405:43.29]Any news on merchandise?
[405:44.41]Yes.
[405:45.69]I just talked to Ashley.
[405:50.47]and we're in the final home stretch of little final tweaks for the new shirt there'll be two shirts to purchase very soon hey you know what a Twitch prime sub is you should use it that's your decision if you feel like subbing to this channel
[406:15.12]I hope you think it's worth it.
[406:16.22]I'm not going to tell you to.
[406:17.88]I'm not going to remind you to.
[406:19.11]I'm not going to make it a point to make sure you're aware that you have the opportunity to pay me.
[406:26.55]That's your choice.
[406:27.61]That's your decision.
[406:36.53]Did the shirts have a genuine Jerma smell?
[406:38.51]Yeah, I roll around in all of them.
[406:41.60]Let's say there's like a thousand shirt sales, so I'm going to throw them all in a pile, and I'm just going to fucking roll around in them.
[406:47.87]But, here's the real kicker, I'm going to cover myself in disgusting old man cologne, so the shirts are going to be unwearable.
[406:59.99]Alright, let's get to the end here.
[407:09.63]Where were we?
[407:11.91]Now that's off.
[407:13.35]That's me.
[407:13.61]That's between me and my son.
[407:14.45]Sorry.
[407:38.92]I thought I had to share everything on social media.
[407:41.42]Case in point.
[407:44.12]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the $1.
[407:45.56]Will Shido be in the next Jerma Rumble?
[407:48.63]100% absolutely guaranteed, yes.
[407:51.49]Klosky, thanks for the $5, Klosky.
[407:54.91]Put this on black for me.
[407:56.69]Okay.
[407:58.44]The next time I find myself in a casino, I will put $5 on black just for you.
[408:07.43]Thank you, Lula, for the $5.
[408:08.61]I know it might be weird when people send you messages about being depressed and you helping them, but it's true.
[408:16.73]My dad has been in the hospital for the last few weeks, and I've been in a dark place, but your streams have really made an impact in my days, and I always look forward to them.
[408:25.63]I know you think you're silly, but you're doing a good thing here.
[408:28.52]Keep it up.
[408:29.24]You're my favorite streamer because you're silly real.
[408:35.22]I'm really sorry to hear about your father.
[408:41.16]That... That sucks.
[408:42.65]That can't be fucking easy.
[408:46.59]I wish nothing but the best for your dad.
[408:53.87]And I'm absolutely, absolutely honored that you have that kind of stuff to say about me and my stream.
[409:09.38]Seriously.
[409:16.84]Hopefully it's nothing serious.
[409:18.42]Hopefully your father has a swift recovery.
[409:23.69]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[409:26.47]Thank you so much for being part of this community.
[409:28.23]Thank you so much for the $5.
[409:33.08]Much love to you.
[409:34.12]For real.
[409:37.54]Thank you.
[409:47.87]Look at those hearts in the chat.
[409:49.17]That's what I like to see.
[409:49.89]I like to see that.
[409:56.28]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $1.
[409:57.80]Have you ever drank apple cider vinegar?
[409:59.40]I had to drink that one time because my stomach was fucked up.
[410:02.78]And that stuff is poison.
[410:04.14]Never again.
[410:06.70]Apple cider vinegar is actually... It's pretty good for you.
[410:11.97]I wouldn't drink it straight.
[410:14.47]But... It has some health benefits...
[410:19.29]It's also a decent salad dressing.
[410:28.68]I have had it before in various things.
[410:31.42]DemonicCucumber, thanks for the $1.
[410:32.78]Hey Jeremy, I was watching last night's VOD and when I went downstairs I thought that reality was a VOD and that I could pause and I also keep forgetting this is live.
[410:42.29]I think I've had a minor breakdown.
[410:44.33]Either that or I need some sleep.
[410:45.97]Either way, mind how you go, man.
[410:53.47]I told you guys about how I used to play so much Diablo II that Diablo II sound effects would wake me up in the middle of the night and I'm like, I could hear them.
[411:03.89]That like, I would hear that and it would wake me up.
[411:08.89]What happened?
[411:09.55]Did something drop on me?
[411:10.29]Did the loop drop?
[411:15.85]I can relate.
[411:17.96]Hey Compact viewer, thanks for the $1.
[411:19.71]Watch both Star Wars Clone Wars cartoons.
[411:21.79]They are great, especially with Clone Wars coming back this year.
[411:24.61]I have heard that sounds great, and it does include my favorite Star Wars character.
[411:31.53]Do you guys know who that is?
[411:33.91]Do you guys know who my favorite Star Wars character is?
[411:39.76]I'm not sure I've ever talked about this.
[411:43.74]It is Nut Chewy.
[411:47.26]Yeah, Jacket got it.
[411:51.78]It's General Grievous.
[411:54.30]Jar Jar?
[411:55.06]No, it's General Grievous is my favorite Star Wars character.
[412:06.42]You're a nerd.
[412:08.74]I'll tell you a quick story before we move on.
[412:11.67]I went to the land of Disney.
[412:15.03]Disneyland, for those of you that can't really keep up and follow.
[412:17.26]Uh, I went to Disneyland.
[412:20.38]Disney, yeah, Disney World, actually.
[412:21.99]The world of Disney.
[412:24.78]That was right after the acquisition and they bought everything and they had you know If you wanted to have something Star Wars related there were a bunch of gift shops tons of shit everywhere Oh, you couldn't you couldn't sneeze without looking in a direction and seeing another shop that had figures and clothes of every single potential Star Wars movie ever and
[412:45.99]Right?
[412:46.91]So, I walk into one of the 500,000 gift shops, and I'm looking around for a Grievous, a general Grievous action figure.
[412:56.77]I'm gonna make like a little statue, like maybe six, seven inch statue of Grievous.
[413:00.77]I said, well, I can't get it anywhere else.
[413:02.53]Where am I gonna get this?
[413:03.25]This is the perfect place to get it.
[413:05.05]I'm not, I shit you not, I had to go and ask somebody behind the counter, and they didn't even know who the fuck I was talking about.
[413:14.31]I was like, do you guys have any Grievous stuff?
[413:15.99]Like a t-shirt or clothes or a figurine or something?
[413:20.91]Greg Grievous.
[413:22.65]Who?
[413:24.49]General Grievous.
[413:27.33]He pulled up a radio.
[413:29.07]I didn't even hear what he said.
[413:31.55]Somebody else came down.
[413:33.29]And they actually couldn't figure out who I was talking about.
[413:35.77]Finally, they said, is that a prequel thing?
[413:38.14]Yeah, he's one of the villains from the prequels.
[413:41.22]We don't have any prequel stuff.
[413:44.95]And that was a lie because there was like pod racers and stuff.
[413:53.06]How do you not have a General Grievous t-shirt?
[413:56.02]At the HQ of Star Wars.
[414:02.50]And I looked it up and it's actually... They never made any.
[414:08.31]I think there was some toys, but I'm talking like a real one of those figures that are like as if you bought a collector's edition for a video game.
[414:24.72]The gift shop is fucked.
[414:32.91]They have to have made something.
[414:34.09]I don't think they did.
[414:34.65]The guy told me that they didn't have anything, and I was like, what?
[414:37.92]What?
[414:40.34]General Garfield.
[414:42.10]Count Dooku is better than General Grievous.
[414:45.56]Well, Count Dooku trained General Grievous, so they're best friends.
[414:49.95]You don't want to have the second part of that team?
[414:57.41]They're not toys, Mom.
[414:59.29]They're figures.
[415:02.77]I wanted it made out of pewter.
[415:06.63]Yeah, that was surprising to me.
[415:10.79]Because General Grievous was a really popular character.
[415:14.37]I know he's very prominent in the Clone Wars, and he's... He just got released into Battlefront II, right?
[415:21.10]Like, give me a Grievous t-shirt.
[415:23.32]Give it to me.
[415:28.15]The only reason why I ever considered downloading Battlefront 2 was just because they just added General Grievous.
[415:39.42]But, I digress.
[415:43.50]TLDW.
[415:45.48]Too long, didn't watch.
[415:46.34]I went to Star Wars headquarters in Florida.
[415:53.05]And they didn't have a General Grievous piece of merchandise.
[416:00.09]But thank you, Corsher, again, for the $1.
[416:02.19]I just borrowed my sister's gift card.
[416:06.65]And SEGA are, I mean, machines SEGA are alive.
[416:10.67]I mean, explain Detroit become human.
[416:12.79]Don't steal anything from anybody.
[416:16.13]That's not good.
[416:19.93]No stealing.
[416:20.55]Don't steal things.
[416:28.24]Hey, yes.
[416:29.82]Vess is online.
[416:31.06]Thanks for the $2.
[416:32.42]Missed part of the stream because of my terrible sleep schedule.
[416:35.05]But that controller complaint is a big meme in fighting games.
[416:37.91]Here's a link of a list called Scrublords.
[416:40.75]Scrublords.
[416:50.00]Scrublords.
[416:51.72]I like to call this the scrub lord's prayer, which goes like this.
[416:54.79]My controls weren't working.
[416:56.07]And if they were, you were playing dishonorably.
[416:58.25]And if you weren't, you were playing without skill.
[417:00.71]And if you were, it's not fun to play that way.
[417:03.37]And if it is, then you only care about winning.
[417:06.01]We know all of this is nonsense because Guy just doesn't know how to block.
[417:09.65]Of course, it's easy to roll your eyes.
[417:19.07]I know what I know.
[417:21.28]And I know that I pressed up and right at the same time and dashed.
[417:24.93]It didn't work.
[417:29.62]I know what I know.
[417:32.70]I didn't say any prayers.
[417:34.79]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer for the $1.
[417:36.93]Please rise, chat.
[417:38.01]It's time for a touching speech written by Sam Eagle.
[417:42.47]Dermo, Sam Eagle isn't actually here.
[417:44.97]I promised he'd be here at the event, but he got delayed by cartoon traffic chump.
[417:49.98]To your best Sam Eagle impression, to fool the audience.
[417:54.22]I wonder how many phrases he might do, like two or three words or one sound before sighing under his breath and giving up.
[418:04.60]If he does do it, I'll eat my shoe.
[418:08.38]Time for a funny garf joke.
[418:10.30]Celeste, more like a mess.
[418:12.96]Was the game good?
[418:14.22]I just tuned in.
[418:22.69]The game is great.
[418:26.02]Those B-tapes, though.
[418:27.02]You know what I mean?
[418:30.66]Hard.
[418:33.20]Thank you, I'm VinnyJK for the $1.
[418:35.98]When will you play Mountain Blade?
[418:40.19]I don't know.
[418:43.31]Maybe one day.
[418:47.27]TimmyTimTam thanks for the $1.
[418:48.81]Are Shito and Otto best friends?
[418:51.61]No, they don't really get along.
[418:53.65]Otto doesn't like the way that he talks.
[418:58.47]Hey, MostlyLost, thanks for the $1.
[418:59.89]You need to do a stream on January 23rd until midnight so we can all say we watched someone.
[419:06.23]I mean, I... Thank you, Dorkcube, for the $1.
[419:11.26]Here's another emote.
[419:13.24]I know you really don't take emissions... Emissions?
[419:17.82]Oh, these emissions.
[419:19.02]You really don't take submissions for emotes, but your streams have been giving me inspiration recently.
[419:26.97]Oh, look at little Shito.
[419:30.89]I think I would want a Shito emote to be a real picture.
[419:40.55]Can you draw my OC drama?
[419:42.31]No, I can't.
[419:43.01]I don't know how to draw.
[419:45.96]But thank you, Dorkube.
[419:49.94]Thank you, Isu... Is this backwards?

[420:07.64]Yeah, he's a good actor.
[420:24.51]Guys, Shito is the automaton Jeremiah got for Christmas, yeah.
[420:36.52]Yeah, that's the automaton.
[420:41.24]But yeah, Denzel Washington's good.
[420:48.26]Thank you for the $1.00.
[420:53.61]What did you do?
[420:54.05]The gnome you got?
[420:55.51]Uh, it's still in the box.
[420:58.10]I... I refused to take it out.
[421:08.68]Uh, thank you MostlyLost for the $1.
[421:10.42]Thank you Tingy for the $1.
[421:12.41]MostlyLost, thanks for the $1.
[421:13.79]Just tweet out a picture of Otto every hour and we'll love it.
[421:16.91]No, no, no, no.
[421:19.59]Cosmic Huend, thanks for the $1.
[421:22.79]You should brag about the $100 on Twitter.
[421:24.83]We talked about it.
[421:25.58]No, I don't want to do that.
[421:27.22]No, we're not going to do that.
[421:29.30]It's your decision.
[421:30.00]It's your choice.
[421:30.60]If you want to give me money, I'm grateful for it.
[421:34.30]We don't have to have incentives for it.
[421:37.84]If you thought it was worth paying for, then sure.
[421:41.26]I'm not going to stop you.
[421:43.41]Kisco, thanks for the $1.
[421:44.67]Write my name on the short whiteboard behind you.
[421:48.06]I don't have a whiteboard.
[421:51.32]What?
[421:53.36]There's no whiteboard behind me.
[421:56.52]What happened to Wailord and the Pokémon socks?
[422:00.72]It got lost in the mail.
[422:03.33]I put in like three inquiries.
[422:06.19]I've asked.
[422:06.67]I've called the post office like 30 times.
[422:08.69]Where is this stuff?
[422:11.74]I'm sorry, Mr. Elbertson, but it went back and forth from the factory, back to the factory, back to the original factory, and I'm like, this is ridiculous.
[422:19.08]This is absolutely ridiculous.
[422:21.27]Can I talk to your manager, please?
[422:22.65]This is ridiculous.
[422:24.71]Hey, this is the manager out of the post office.
[422:26.73]Let me tell you something.
[422:28.71]This is the last time you're gonna lose this.
[422:30.99]I'm gonna call the FTC on you.
[422:34.53]I'm gonna call the Better Business Bureau, and they're gonna figure this out.
[422:37.99]Unbelievable.
[422:39.33]I'm sorry, Mr. Elbertson.
[422:40.57]We have no idea where it went.
[422:42.31]Back to the... I think it went back to the factory.
[422:44.79]Unbelievable.
[422:54.22]Hey, thank you, Bruce Lee, for the $1.
[422:58.12]We told you to donate, so here you go.
[422:59.60]Love you, germs.
[423:00.58]You told... I didn't tell you to donate.
[423:07.05]Show us the order then.
[423:07.79]That was another thing.
[423:08.29]When I ordered, I had to call that store.
[423:10.53]They messed up the order like 10 times.
[423:13.69]Somehow, the food was on there.
[423:18.17]I called them.
[423:19.09]This is unbelievable.
[423:23.36]Why is there... Why is there an order of cocktail shrimp on here?
[423:29.04]You better be careful.
[423:29.74]I'm going to call the FTC on you.
[423:41.93]Sorry, chat, he didn't order it.
[423:43.82]He really didn't.
[423:47.18]Alright, how about this?
[423:47.86]You ready for it?
[423:49.98]Yeah, ready?
[423:51.08]I 100% guarantee, clip this so you know, that this time, by this time next week, on the day of Jeremy's death, I don't like to even say that.
[424:06.41]I don't like, I'm just gonna say the 23rd.
[424:07.89]I'm gonna, okay, the goalie stream, where I'm dressed up as a goalie.
[424:18.96]Alright, so on the goalie stream, I will be wearing the socks.
[424:24.78]And the whale will be in the room.
[424:27.62]Flip it and guarantee it.
[424:28.86]Stamp it.
[424:29.50]That means I said it, so it has to be done now.
[424:33.20]Hopefully I can get it not lost in the mail by then.
[424:40.16]Thank you, MostlyLost, for the $1.
[424:41.68]Hey everyone, check in the top right corner to see if your Prime sub is available.
[424:47.52]Oh.
[424:48.28]Oh, you're making one of those jokes.
[424:49.98]Hey, Dubskidoo, thanks for the one dollar.
[424:51.52]Pretend that my dog just died and that this donation is actually 10,000 bits.
[424:56.13]Only your epic gamer voice can console me right now.
[425:03.41]Uh, Corshirt, thanks for the one dollar.
[425:05.51]Will you make any action figures of yourself or characters?
[425:09.72]Um... Probably, I mean...
[425:15.88]Glue Man's a really easy idea for that.
[425:20.13]But that's a whole... I don't want to talk about ideas, because every time I talk about ideas, I make them real, and then... Oh, fuck, like, that was an idea.
[425:31.57]When can I act on this?
[425:32.45]Can I do this?
[425:32.99]How much money does this cost?
[425:34.95]So when I'm ready, that's when I'll talk about some stuff like that, if it ever happens.
[425:40.31]I have this tendency to be like, I want to do this, and I want to do that, and I want to do this, and I want to do that.
[425:45.41]And it's like, oh, holy shit, look at all this stuff that's coming.
[425:47.65]And it's like, oh, those are the things that I want to do.
[425:49.77]I'm not ready.
[425:51.05]So.
[425:56.83]We'll see.
[425:57.17]Stay tuned.
[425:59.79]Dr. Steen, thanks for the $1 drink.
[426:01.42]Water on face came to prove you're a hydrated streamer.
[426:05.07]Uh, no, it's alright.
[426:06.15]I'll just lie down on the ground when it rains.
[426:08.44]And just like absorb it.
[426:10.24]Thanks Grill Master Barbecue X. That's not even the correct name.
[426:13.68]I mean, what the heck?
[426:15.60]It's X Barbecue.
[426:18.60]Grill Master Pro Tip.
[426:19.85]When grilling sea lizards, try adding a bit of brown sugar and a hint of spicy mustard for a sweet dessert treat.
[426:34.03]That's the end of the bits.
[426:35.05]Let's take a look at the credits.
[426:37.79]All the subs, you guys, are amazing.
[426:39.59]Thank you for your subscriptions.
[426:44.21]Everybody's too kind.
[426:49.81]Thank you, thank you, thank you, guys.
[426:50.93]Have a great night, everybody.
[427:00.25]Thanks for staying up late.
[427:02.41]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[427:08.46]Sorry for my rage.
[427:11.48]But it wasn't really that bad.
[427:14.98]I would know if I had a meltdown.
[427:16.89]It was barely... It was like 40% Mario Tennis.
[427:18.69]But, I'll see you guys soon.
[427:36.40]Jerma with wings?
[427:37.28]What do you mean with wings?
[427:38.18]Butterfly wings.
[427:43.20]You yelled at us?
[427:44.08]No, I didn't.
[427:44.62]When did I do that?
[427:46.70]I didn't yell at you guys.
[427:47.68]I talked about, like, how I didn't like the clouds and the buttons.
[427:51.68]I talked about the treasure map.
[427:52.80]I wasn't yelling.
[427:53.46]When did I yell at you?
[427:54.93]I didn't yell at you guys.
[427:56.93]When did I do that?
[427:59.81]I yelled.
[428:01.37]I did not yell at you guys.
[428:03.61]You said that chat sucks.
[428:06.36]No, I was- that was a dream you had in the audience.
[428:08.87]Alright, Shito.
[428:22.06]Shito, you awake?
[428:25.82]Oh, okay.
[428:27.24]You wanna say bye?
[428:27.82]Okay.
[428:30.70]Shito wants to say goodbye.
[428:37.73]See ya.
[428:41.21]See you next time.
[428:49.84]Kill me.
[428:51.24]That's not what Shito said.
[428:59.14]I really, I really, I love Shito.
[429:03.08]I need to get Shito clothes.
[429:12.86]Balls deep in a glass of milk?
[429:14.74]I don't get it.
[429:24.31]I don't understand.
[429:26.03]Why did somebody just write that?
[429:28.75]Why did I read that?
[429:29.75]Why did you write that?
[429:32.29]Why did you write that?
[429:42.82]Why is that your name?
[429:58.67]Thank you guys.
[429:59.23]I'll see you Friday.
[429:59.91]Have a great rest of your evening.
[430:02.84]See you real soon.
[430:05.54]Goodbye.
[430:18.03]Thank you.
