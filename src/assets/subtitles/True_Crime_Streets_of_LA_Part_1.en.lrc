[00:02.50]Let's open up True Crime Streets of LA.
[00:04.30]It would have been nice if it opened when I said it.
[00:09.44]It would have been a big wow factor for you guys.
[00:13.15]But that's okay.
[00:14.81]You can't always get what you want.
[00:18.27]I mean, it would be nice.
[00:22.36]But then we'd all be millionaires from the lottery.
[00:25.36]Every time you went into the lottery...
[00:30.61]Okay, now I think I think we're cooking now At least I hope so Internet still works.
[00:43.42]We're fine Although did this just like break completely oh my goodness It was such a pain in the ass to try to get this game to run to come on do it I
[00:59.59]Do it.
[01:02.47]Do it.
[01:05.23]Don't make me angry.
[01:09.19]Oh, you are making me angry now.
[01:16.56]Like, just do it.
[01:17.86]Did it do it?
[01:20.48]Did it do it?
[01:20.98]It did it!
[01:21.48]Alright, it did it!
[01:23.50]Why is it tiny?
[01:28.68]Why is it tiny?
[01:30.28]It shouldn't be that small.
[01:34.01]Resolution.
[01:34.49]What?
[01:35.33]640 by 480.
[01:36.77]What era are we in?
[01:41.13]Okay.
[01:42.69]That's good.
[01:43.18]Apply the changes.
[01:45.02]Yes.
[01:48.82]That looks great.
[01:49.76]I'm going to have to move this.
[01:56.23]Because that is not correct.
[02:01.35]You guys are gonna have to deal with this.
[02:07.45]And those of you that are wondering, what is with this absolutely just messed up... Why am I playing these games right now?
[02:18.02]That's a very, very, very valid point.
[02:20.88]And the point is, I cleaned out my closet of PC games.
[02:27.72]I bought a shitload of old PC games a long time ago.
[02:31.66]And I ended up with just like... They have like seven left.
[02:35.90]And it took me a long time to install this one.
[02:38.10]So we're going to play this one for a little while.
[02:40.26]I cannot alt-tab again because I will break the game and the computer.
[02:44.96]So if one of the mods is around and it could change this to True Crime Streets of LA, that would be fantastic.
[02:51.76]I would love you forever.
[02:54.68]That's so loud.
[02:55.42]But here we go.
[02:55.88]New game, True Crime Streets of LA.
[02:59.31]After this...
[03:00.91]we ain't got a plan so we're done after this hope it lasts at least an hour or two single player true no true crime streets of la save would you like to create a save yes I would by the way um just want to be very very clear this could be extraordinarily loud so just be be ready uh California enter name gotta have my license plate
[03:28.39]Why not?
[03:28.71]Of course it's going to be... Oh, really?
[03:32.31]Jerma 98?
[03:33.51]No.
[03:34.51]That means I was like born in 1998.
[03:36.02]God damn it.
[03:37.02]What about... Can I do like spaces?
[03:44.52]Area.
[03:45.23]Nice.
[03:45.77]Okay.
[03:50.65]Ready to move.
[03:54.88]Just do no E. That's Christopher Walken.
[03:56.57]Is he actually in this game?
[03:59.13]Why is he here?
[03:59.89]He didn't deserve it.
[04:24.24]It's too quiet?
[04:24.96]I'll fix it.
[04:25.48]We'll make it more quiet?
[04:50.95]I wonder how much money he got for this game.
[04:53.49]I'll see if I can do a good Christopher Walken.
[04:57.81]I'll try.
[05:01.05]Someone will get to the throat.
[05:04.50]What happened to Henry was a true crime.
[05:07.98]Streets of LA, if there's one man who deserves it, it's his son, Nicholas King Wilson.
[05:13.66]I'm gonna give it 4 out of 10.
[05:19.44]And wow, you didn't even get to have a walk-in.
[05:21.68]I already did this joke like a year ago.
[05:25.08]Sorry.
[05:27.10]Hey, Johnson.
[05:28.24]Since when does LAPD issue weapons to meter baits?
[05:31.50]Ah, what did you say to me, motherfucker?
[05:33.92]Hey, Johnson.
[05:35.36]How about that time to straight fit you in a wiener, huh?
[05:39.22]Shut your mouth, you old loser.
[05:41.44]Up yours, pal.
[05:43.92]Oh, my, that huge snake.
[05:45.64]Let me tell you.
[05:47.25]That's Christopher Walken.
[05:48.55]Whoa, George.
[05:49.62]That seems so odd coming out of that guy's mouth.
[05:52.70]If Christopher Walken's in your game, it has to be Christopher Walken's face.
[05:56.89]That guy does a great Christopher Walken impression.
[06:15.51]And kid, maybe think about firing one piece at a time.
[06:19.61]Saves an arm for the senoritas.
[06:22.01]You know what I mean?
[06:23.27]It's almost like you walk in here.
[06:25.59]Hey!
[06:26.79]Hey, Sergeant Daniel!
[06:28.01]Do your Christopher Walken impression.
[06:29.46]It's fucking spot on.
[06:31.06]Alright, let me turn the volume up a little bit.
[06:39.04]This is why I turned it down in the first place, guys.
[06:40.72]Do you understand how loud that is?
[06:44.65]Oh yeah, and I turned off the music too.
[06:46.35]Don't even think about complaining about that.
[06:49.31]Every song in this entire game is a copyrighted song.
[06:52.79]You'll never be able to watch this VOD, and I will never be able to have a video.
[06:55.95]There'll be no edited video of this.
[06:59.63]So, like, sorry guys, you have to deal with no music.
[07:06.30]Alright, here comes a loud, loud, loud noise.
[07:10.66]Here it comes.
[07:14.94]Okay.
[07:17.30]So, press fire space to draw a weapon and then press space to fire.
[07:23.20]Why is space bar fire?
[07:26.62]Use pan left, number seven, and pan right to switch targets.
[07:30.16]What the fuck are you thinking?
[07:32.24]I have a mouse.
[07:36.96]No, I'm gonna click.
[07:37.80]What is it?
[07:38.84]Click the... What?
[07:44.55]That was a... Alright, so we take... This game takes place on the moon.
[07:50.22]That's good to know.
[07:51.74]Look at my moon physics.
[07:53.40]I need to... This sensitivity is all over the place.
[07:58.24]Mouse controls.
[08:00.20]Center camera.
[08:01.08]Frisk is for... Frisk, grab, pick up, throw, stealth, kill.
[08:05.60]This game is going to be like game of the year.
[08:08.15]Punch, stealth, stunt, can... What?
[08:10.43]M?
[08:10.49]M.
[08:13.47]What are they trying to say here?
[08:17.53]What denominations are these?
[08:18.79]Mouse controls?
[08:20.99]Right, middle, left, four?
[08:24.63]Alright.
[08:25.83]We're just going to go in with our pants up too tight.
[08:28.61]You know what I'm saying?
[08:31.90]Sensitivity.
[08:33.72]Somebody just gave $100.
[08:34.26]Never Trust Purple just gave $100.
[08:35.62]And I can't even see what it says.
[08:41.26]I wish I could see it.
[08:43.27]Thank you so much, dude.
[08:44.71]I can't alt-tab otherwise this whole thing goes down.
[08:50.56]Thank you.
[08:51.60]I'll get to it eventually here near the end of the stream.
[08:53.90]But thank you so much, dude.
[08:56.22]Even still, this is so sloppy.
[09:01.73]This is gonna be so much fun.
[09:02.93]Sensitivity's gotta go down even further.
[09:09.19]Gun sensitivity.
[09:09.95]This has gotta come down to like fucking zero.
[09:14.47]I've got a feeling the same thing is going to happen here.
[09:20.79]Alright, getting there.
[09:25.48]Did I get 10 targets?
[09:29.18]This is fun.
[09:32.32]Did I lose?
[09:32.78]Alright, I got 30.
[09:35.38]Let's destroy 10 targets.
[09:46.27]Oh, this is fun.
[09:47.19]Why didn't this game get like a sequel?
[09:50.99]They should have done like, it's the city of Austin.
[09:58.29]R is reload like it always is.
[10:01.68]No, they're making it harder.
[10:05.06]Not hard for me.
[10:05.90]I'm like one of the greatest video game players in the entire universe.
[10:15.96]Shit!
[10:19.90]Is it bullet travel?
[10:22.35]I think there is.
[10:22.99]Did I lose?
[10:26.31]Come on, dude.
[10:26.95]Okay, we're good.
[10:36.07]I feel like I shouldn't be able to do this.
[10:40.05]Someone will die if I don't read bits.
[10:42.79]I can't.
[10:44.31]I can't do it.
[10:45.38]I can't read it.
[10:46.96]I wish I could.
[10:47.76]I'm so sorry.
[10:49.44]I'd hate to be in your crosshairs.
[10:51.54]Chief, I wonder how you found me.
[10:53.44]Hey, George, do that funny impression.
[10:54.93]Leave George out of it.
[10:56.51]Here.
[10:57.51]No, you don't understand, Carol.
[10:58.99]You gotta hear as Christopher Walken.
[11:00.51]It's perfect.
[11:01.59]All mom and pop outfits in Chinatown.
[11:03.95]You know it's the triad.
[11:05.31]Exactly.
[11:06.09]No one's talking.
[11:07.23]No one wants to touch it.
[11:08.32]Read the bits.
[11:09.00]Okay, hold on, hold on.
[11:10.24]I need an answer, Nick.
[11:11.66]Now.
[11:12.24]Come on, Chief.
[11:13.28]The game's gonna crash.
[11:14.46]Remember?
[11:15.44]Nick, this is EOD.
[11:18.04]Elite Operations Division.
[11:20.44]A special unit with jurisdiction over the entire city.
[11:23.89]The badge is yours.
[11:25.43]Just say the word.
[11:26.96]I don't know, Chief.
[11:28.10]Nick, you can get closer to these guys than anyone else.
[11:32.18]Okay, okay.
[11:33.50]But I'm gonna do it my way.
[11:35.68]I wouldn't have it any other way.
[11:38.08]Meet me at the station ASAP.
[11:40.26]Alright, Chief.
[11:41.76]See you later, George.
[11:42.58]Let's see.
[11:44.16]No, he didn't say anything.
[11:45.90]Alright, so let me wait until this is done loading.
[11:51.24]Race to Chief's office.
[11:52.82]I only have a minute and 27 seconds.
[11:57.39]Press tab to enter and this is a lot of information.
[12:01.35]Press F to honk the horn, E to use the siren.
[12:05.39]I can't go fast enough!
[12:12.93]Was that just an animal?
[12:13.97]I don't know, you see versions, you see frames.
[12:24.36]Whatever, you go.
[12:27.64]I got a fence on my car.
[12:29.02]It's alright.
[12:34.44]We're off to an alright start.
[12:35.80]I told you.
[12:36.28]This is why I turned it down.
[12:38.50]I have 42 seconds to get to the end of the mission.
[12:41.57]We're going to be fine.
[12:42.27]Turn this off.
[12:43.53]How do I turn off the siren?
[12:45.77]Turn the siren off.
[12:48.03]Oh my god.
[12:48.65]What is it?
[12:50.45]E?
[12:50.51]What's the siren button?
[12:53.19]How do I turn off the siren?
[12:54.43]Oh wait.
[12:55.21]No.
[13:02.80]Can't alright the car was on fire I'll take
[13:31.12]Oh, my fucking head!
[13:33.80]Why did he have to burp at the end?
[13:36.44]What was the point of that?
[13:37.44]Okay.
[13:39.34]Jesus.
[13:58.85]I love how if you just suck, it doesn't even matter.
[14:01.27]You can just continue playing.
[14:05.75]This is fun.
[14:07.37]No, we're not going to fucking kill everybody this time.
[14:12.02]The game just crashed.
[14:14.86]No, it didn't.
[14:15.28]Yeah, it did.
[14:17.58]Come on.
[14:17.84]Give it back.
[14:18.34]Give it back.
[14:18.66]Give it back.
[14:19.82]Give it back.
[14:20.80]This is the best game ever.
[14:21.82]Don't make me... Alright, we're good.
[14:27.45]He's gonna... He's gonna walk into it.
[14:35.36]So, if I hit... Alright, use the... Number 6 to use the emergency brake?
[14:42.37]No, I don't want to shoot the gun.
[14:51.15]Alright, I can see the bits now.
[14:52.64]I all tap and freaked out.
[14:55.07]Let me get to like a position where I can turn... Let me just turn this... Hold on.
[15:00.24]We gotta give this what it deserves.
[15:02.28]Let me just turn this down a little.
[15:05.18]Because it is like insane for my ears.
[15:09.88]Okay.
[15:11.74]There's no accept button.
[15:12.82]I think I lost it.
[15:15.94]I can't... There's no accept button.
[15:17.40]It's gone.
[15:21.14]All I can do is play with the sound effects.
[15:24.47]Oh lord, what happened here?
[15:25.71]Oh my goodness.
[15:29.27]Alright, well I can see the bits.
[15:31.49]So, this is really important.
[15:32.91]Never Trust Purple gave $150.
[15:34.09]And said, play the Neighbors From Hell music in the background while playing this game.
[15:39.16]It's important, please.
[15:45.78]Where am I even going to get that?
[15:49.70]Come on, get me out of here!
[15:51.24]Ah, shit.
[15:52.04]I have to restart the game.
[15:58.92]Wait, wait, wait!
[16:02.02]We can't alt-tab again.
[16:07.86]Thank you so much, purple.
[16:10.66]But I'm gonna have to get it on my phone.
[16:12.70]Because I'm not alt-tabbing.
[16:14.54]Here.
[16:15.78]I'll do you one here.
[16:19.21]I'm not gonna deny it.
[16:19.99]I'll do it.
[16:20.35]This has to be done on... This has to be done on my cellphone.
[16:27.73]Alright.
[16:28.69]Neighbors from Hell music.
[16:34.49]Why?
[16:35.11]Why?
[16:35.51]Here you go.
[16:40.09]Neighbors from Hell track one.
[16:41.41]Let's hear it.
[16:45.83]Here it comes.
[16:51.65]Let's drive.
[17:01.49]Alright, that was it.
[17:05.81]This is the menu music?
[17:07.65]You didn't specify!
[17:11.22]What's going on?
[17:11.70]Why can't I turn the car?
[17:13.48]Turn the car!
[17:14.26]Oh my god, turn the car.
[17:25.23]I only have two seconds, so I don't care Alright, shut it shut it off There it is oh Good right on time
[17:47.46]To all the bank.

[17:51.89]I can't even, like... It burps.
[17:53.23]I want to watch that burp.
[17:54.15]Like, right now.
[17:55.11]I think I have to dry... I think I have to turn with the mouse.
[18:16.22]Suit yourself.
[18:17.01]Okay.
[18:17.29]So how do I actually drive the car?
[18:19.19]She threw that really, really hard and really fast.
[18:21.63]That like broke my hand.
[18:37.11]To arrest defeated criminals, stand near them and press the frisk and grab.
[18:41.61]Alright.
[18:42.43]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[18:50.08]Drive to restaurant.
[18:54.48]Time to hit the road, Jack.
[18:55.86]It's time to hit the road.
[18:56.92]Warren G. Oh no, that's the song that's not playing.
[19:02.46]Alright, so we're gonna drive to the restaurant.
[19:04.80]Why would that guy be in the middle of the road?
[19:09.35]So driving just sucks.

[19:46.75]There's only two suspects?!
[19:52.94]Again... Alright, that guy just drove into me.
[19:58.17]Active units!
[19:58.49]Hungry Hector is at large.
[19:59.53]He's a known cannibal.
[20:00.13]And he's also on fire.
[20:00.97]Who am I talking about?
[20:01.97]This guy?
[20:02.41]Is it the bus?
[20:02.99]Is the bus the bad guy?
[20:30.01]Is this the guy?
[20:33.40]What the?

[20:41.50]How do I do combos?
[20:46.51]Arrest him.
[20:48.09]How do I arrest him?
[20:48.79]He just did like a sweet chin music to me.
[20:54.32]How do I take out the gun?
[20:58.50]Oh shit, I clicked off the window.
[21:02.77]Come on, go, get back there.

[21:07.39]God damn it.
[21:08.57]Cut the shit, game.
[21:14.19]Come on, open.
[21:16.43]Alright, we're good.
[21:24.64]What is supposed to be happening right now?
[21:31.24]Come on, run into this guy.
[21:32.66]Run into this guy.
[21:33.31]Somebody run into this guy.
[21:35.91]Why is there just a bus on fire?
[21:37.43]And why is there so many people in the road?
[21:41.73]Why are there this many people in the road?
[21:43.49]What is this loud sound?
[21:46.88]Does anybody know?
[21:50.20]Why are they all creeping up on me like Pac-Man ghosts?
[21:56.21]Nobody's even in that car.
[22:06.12]disintegrated.
[22:08.10]This guy's going to get hit.
[22:09.56]I guarantee it.
[22:14.85]This is great.
[22:19.59]This is great.
[22:20.43]I love this game.
[22:21.97]Prime resolved.
[22:22.73]Okay, right click is kick.
[22:29.80]So you can do combos.
[22:32.48]Let's test out a combo.
[22:36.32]What's going on here?
[22:40.36]Let's test out a combo.
[22:44.51]How do I, like, lock on?
[22:45.37]What's a lock on button?
[22:47.61]Alright, that's how you alternate.
[22:52.89]That's how you ass kick.
[22:54.48]Alright, arrest.
[22:55.00]Arrest him.
[22:56.78]Arrest him.
[22:58.20]Use loitering.
[23:00.14]I saw you take that fucking newspaper from that newspaper stand.
[23:02.92]You didn't pay that 25 cents.
[23:07.60]Wait, you don't think this economy a quarter's not worth it?
[23:10.76]Alright, arrest him.
[23:14.13]Arrest.
[23:14.39]How do I put the, how do I put the, uh, the cuffs on?
[23:19.43]Arrest.
[23:22.25]You're under arrest.
[23:25.77]Stop the carjacker?
[23:26.89]Where's there, where's there a carjacker?
[23:32.28]Where is he?
[23:33.32]There he is.
[23:34.54]I need this, police.
[23:35.50]Open up!
[23:37.79]Okay, that's one way to be a police officer.
[23:40.15]Open up or I'm going to shoot you.
[23:41.17]Alright, there he is.
[23:41.93]Catch the car thief.
[23:47.22]Don't let him get away.
[23:49.54]You know what?
[23:50.28]This game is way better than GTA.
[23:51.58]You know why?
[23:51.98]Because trees don't stop you.
[23:54.80]There he is.
[24:01.54]I haven't even done a mission yet.
[24:03.20]I'm just realizing this now.
[24:06.29]That was a perfect weave.
[24:07.17]I'll give this guy credit where it's due.
[24:14.77]I was gonna shoot like little pebbles at him and he'll be done in a moment's notice.
[24:19.05]Look at these little space invader bullets.
[24:24.35]How are these not hitting him?
[24:32.98]Am I... is this targeting him?
[24:36.14]Is this... What the fuck?
[24:38.69]Alright, I... Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[24:41.95]He gave up, he gave up.
[24:42.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[24:45.27]Where are you going?
[24:46.25]Put your hands up.
[24:48.23]Get your hands... No, you don't steal another car.
[24:50.57]Oh, the carjacker strikes again.
[24:51.87]Give me a break.
[24:54.07]Wait, wait, no!
[24:58.52]I didn't want to arrest this guy.
[24:59.88]He had nothing to do with... Stop diving.
[25:18.46]He's gone.
[25:19.38]He's gone.
[25:19.88]I need this car.
[25:20.60]Give me your car.
[25:21.24]Give me the car you were just using.
[25:25.50]It's un-fucking-believable.
[25:28.46]Alright, can I catch up to him?
[25:31.16]This thing's still got some juice in it.
[25:32.38]It's alright.
[25:35.23]Max jump distance, 21 meters.
[25:37.29]He was waiting for me.
[25:38.19]Alright, I'll get him.
[25:39.95]Carjacker strikes again.
[25:40.73]I'm gonna make sure I arrest him this time.
[25:46.64]I'll eventually get him out of the car.
[25:48.38]I want to arrest him.
[25:49.36]I don't want him to die.
[25:51.12]I don't want him to disappear.
[25:54.83]I would like to arrest this man.
[25:58.57]So, sir, if you could please, where's my siren?
[26:01.51]No, that's a beep.
[26:04.33]Pull over.
[26:08.66]Pull over the car right now!
[26:13.88]Get out of the car!
[26:17.18]Get out of the car!
[26:21.64]Move.
[26:21.94]Alright.
[26:26.49]Put your hands in the air.
[26:31.43]How do I get this guy to stop?
[26:33.33]I wanna arrest him.
[26:40.06]There's no reason for you to dive.
[26:41.02]Oh my god.
[26:45.47]If I shoot him one time in the back, will he stop?
[26:48.33]That was very loud and terrible.
[26:49.69]Alright, I'm giving him warning shots.
[26:53.77]Alright, I hit him in the back.
[26:55.19]That's not enough.
[26:56.17]Stop, please.
[27:00.08]Okay, he's been shot twice.
[27:03.06]Please.
[27:05.22]Just stop.
[27:06.86]Stop it.
[27:07.72]You're doing this.
[27:08.36]You're hurting yourself.
[27:11.42]Sir.
[27:11.64]Sir.
[27:13.82]If I could get you just to comply for five seconds, that would be very, very nice of you.
[27:21.65]Alright, fuck this.
[27:27.39]Get over here.
[27:30.41]God damn it.
[27:32.47]I will get the tackle.
[27:34.63]Tag the lady.
[27:35.31]Wrong lady.
[27:39.49]Come here!
[27:41.39]No, he's taking another car and the game's crashing.
[27:47.12]Oh my god.
[27:48.64]Alright, I got him.
[27:52.30]You're under arrest.
[27:53.84]Arrest him!
[27:56.94]How do you arrest?
[27:57.50]T?
[27:58.74]What's the arrest button?
[27:59.97]It should be E. It doesn't look like it's E. What is the arrest button?
[28:08.89]Oh my lord.
[28:11.75]Um, well, just stay there.
[28:20.58]You're under arrest.
[28:25.34]There it is, X. Okay, finally.
[28:29.26]I thought that lady was gonna run his head over.
[28:35.54]Nice, alright, we got our first trip, we got our first trip.
[28:40.38]Stop the street fight.
[28:45.54]Really?
[28:46.26]Okay, I don't know who's at fault here.
[28:51.06]It's both the same lady.
[28:52.91]Alright, obviously it was you.
[28:54.57]No, it wasn't you.
[28:57.01]You're both guilty.
[29:00.31]Every time I try to do anything, the game just fucking all tabs out on its own.
[29:09.04]That's really irritating.
[29:11.24]Oh, okay.
[29:12.48]Well, it turns out... Lady... What's a good health bar?
[29:19.74]That... How am I losing?
[29:24.29]I'm like a trained martial artist.
[29:26.93]God damn it.
[29:32.85]Every time.
[29:33.99]I can't, like, move my mouse.
[29:38.34]It just alt-tabs me out of the game.
[29:40.67]Oh my god, forget it!
[29:41.79]This lady just... Stop her!
[29:47.69]Please be a better cop than me.
[29:52.15]How do I take out a gun?
[29:54.09]That's how you really make people comply, right?
[29:56.06]Like, where's the gun button?
[30:02.40]Alright.
[30:05.72]Arrest her.
[30:09.18]Why did everything turn green?
[30:11.86]Alright, let's put this away.
[30:12.80]What was I doing?
[30:13.72]I was going to a bank or something, right?
[30:18.34]Oh my god.
[30:19.20]That's getting real, real annoying.
[30:21.38]I need to be careful.
[30:27.40]You know what?
[30:28.10]It's coming on the... That's really stupid.
[30:30.12]I hate that shit.
[30:30.76]Alright, let's go get the other one.
[30:34.60]Let's do the next one right.
[30:36.42]What's going on here?
[30:37.70]Why am I stuck?
[30:55.87]Why was I doing that?
[30:56.93]This is not nice.
[31:01.19]Where is she?
[31:03.67]She's right there.
[31:09.32]No, stay in the car.
[31:11.50]Not even worth it.
[31:12.08]Just run her over.
[31:14.38]She's behind me.
[31:16.32]Somebody's chasing behind the car right now.
[31:20.46]Alright, let's apprehend the criminal.
[31:26.08]That should be enough.
[31:45.04]Okay.
[31:46.67]Kinda got a little outplayed there.
[31:48.59]Kinda got baited.
[31:49.33]That's alright, we're gonna track her down.
[31:54.93]Nice wheels, man.
[31:59.37]Watch her not even be in a car.
[32:03.10]There she is.
[32:03.68]I didn't expect to be cut off around the corner here.
[32:07.14]Gonna play this smart.
[32:11.40]You can run away as long as you want, lady.
[32:14.76]But you're not absolved of your crimes.
[32:16.52]The law will always track you down.
[32:19.73]Crush it!
[32:29.65]Game!
[32:30.75]Don't!
[32:31.75]I'll tap!
[32:42.92]No!
[32:43.98]No!
[32:50.50]Stop it!
[32:51.99]Oh, one got away!
[32:53.81]One got away!
[32:56.11]You guys can't be there!
[32:57.81]Get out of here!
[32:58.51]I can't... I can't go anywhere!
[33:05.25]Stop the street fight!
[33:07.20]Oh, it's just constant!
[33:08.66]Is it the same ladies?
[33:12.39]Where is this happening?
[33:13.29]It's the same lady.
[33:16.93]Alright, we're gonna get this in one fell swoop.
[33:19.07]Three, two, one.
[33:21.65]Got one.
[33:21.95]Alright, good.
[33:26.77]That's all it takes.
[33:27.35]I ain't messing around anymore.
[33:29.71]Tough justice.
[33:31.85]This lady won't die.
[33:34.29]I've hit, this lady's invincible.
[33:38.28]Are you serious?
[33:42.19]She's a super- she's a mute.
[33:44.11]She's a fucking mute!
[33:47.93]She's unkillable.
[33:49.25]She just- she's scary.
[33:51.15]She's just running towards the car.
[33:59.88]This is the best game ever.
[34:02.62]This might be the best video game ever made.
[34:07.86]This is how you solve problems, guys.
[34:13.26]Can we do a mission or am I going to get another random crime that pops up on the radar?
[34:21.46]I was not expecting this.
[34:22.66]I've never played this game.
[34:25.14]No.
[34:25.32]Well, got one of them.
[34:26.76]Locate illegal street race.
[34:28.52]Well, it just blew right by me.
[34:30.51]One of them crashed into me.
[34:42.36]There's too much going on.
[34:50.19]There we go.
[34:53.75]Gotta aim it right, and then... Illegal street race.
[35:00.63]Bring these guys downtown.
[35:06.66]By the way, what kind of pistol is this?
[35:09.82]Because you can shoot this many times.
[35:12.74]My bad, my bad.
[35:24.95]What is that guy doing?
[35:32.02]Come on, land one of them!
[35:33.78]Land one shot!
[35:36.00]Oh my god, are you kidding me?
[35:38.50]You suck!
[35:43.56]Is that an explosion?
[35:46.90]There, it was an explosion.
[35:55.02]I just wanna do the mission, I can't do it.
[35:56.56]That guy's just pretending to be a regular person now.
[36:00.93]That guy went into full-on, I'm an NPC mode.
[36:04.25]I know you're not an NPC.
[36:06.45]We know this for a fact.
[36:08.55]We'll take care of you.
[36:12.13]That's one down.
[36:14.05]Nah, let's just go to the mission.
[36:15.09]We're doing the mission.
[36:20.67]I feel like there's a lot more to see in this game.
[36:22.21]We just do it.
[36:23.13]We got to move on.
[36:26.75]Really?
[36:27.11]Come on.
[36:27.37]You can't go over there.
[36:29.09]That's such horse shit.
[36:34.09]Just loud noises.
[36:37.83]Oh, I forgot.
[36:38.35]There is an alignment system in this game.
[36:40.41]You can be good cop or bad cop.
[36:44.26]What is this?
[36:45.49]Okay, that's a pretty... Locate the kidnapped star.
[36:48.03]Okay.
[36:48.21]They keep giving me all these interesting things to do.
[36:50.15]I have to do them.
[37:13.17]Shit!
[37:14.19]No, don't let him get away.
[37:17.78]Lawful evil?
[37:19.70]Uh, no.
[37:20.14]This is like... This is total chaos.
[37:24.30]This is not even chaotic evil.
[37:25.50]It's just total chaos.
[37:26.46]It's all the way to the bottom right.
[37:28.14]And then some.
[37:28.72]It's off the chart.
[37:34.09]What a carnage.
[37:35.15]Not even chaotic.
[37:36.13]He's driving really fast, too.
[37:38.83]And he's much better at the game than I am.
[37:41.39]Shit!
[37:44.63]Alright, so how do I protect the person in the car?
[37:48.88]Welcome to Echo Park.
[37:56.62]Okay.
[37:57.40]I think the game may have actually crashed.
[38:02.01]Shoot the driver?
[38:05.11]It always comes back into, like, action mode.
[38:06.99]Alright, I gotta get up here and shoot.
[38:09.27]Shoot the driver.
[38:11.77]Shoot the driver.
[38:14.49]Alright, gotta be careful there.
[38:15.38]Don't want to shoot the... Right there.
[38:22.24]I'm not shooting the driver very well.
[38:23.72]I'm in fact, I'm just shooting the car.
[38:28.08]This car is fucking busted up.
[38:30.59]Suspect is in the vehicle.
[38:32.11]Where's the... Is this... Is this the... Where's the bad guy?
[38:35.97]Is this... Is this the bad guy?
[38:45.24]Did somebody get out of the car?
[38:54.36]No.
[38:54.96]That... God damn it!
[39:08.34]Why?
[39:24.88]I shot her in the head.
[39:26.80]I shot her in the head.
[39:29.68]I was trying to do a thing where the car explodes and it's a big deal and it's funny.
[39:34.00]But man, give me a break.
[39:34.99]I shot this person in the face.
[39:36.89]I don't care.
[39:45.39]Get over it.
[39:46.87]Get over it.
[39:48.09]We need to play the game.
[39:51.48]Please.
[39:52.82]Just get me to the marker.
[39:56.90]Who did I kill?
[39:57.76]I didn't kill anybody.
[40:04.59]I didn't even shoot anybody.
[40:07.47]I'm so confused.
[40:08.67]What is going on right now?
[40:16.48]I just want to go in this building.
[40:20.63]Somebody just said, I heard Adam Sandler.
[40:32.46]It really is Adam Sandler.
[40:38.84]Oh my god.
[40:39.74]No, I don't want to upgrade.
[40:41.69]Firing range?
[40:42.59]No, let's not do this right now.
[40:46.59]Get back in my shitbox.
[40:50.31]I just went back to the tutorial.
[40:54.29]And why is this person still on my screen?
[40:56.41]You've had so much time to get out of here.
[41:05.18]There he is, this Adam Sandler.
[41:09.58]I gotta go to the green marker.
[41:13.40]I've just lost total track of everything.
[41:22.39]That was just a Jerm of voice.
[41:27.75]See, I could have been in this game.
[41:30.48]Just pay me like $5 and I'll do it.
[41:34.46]Ugh.
[41:36.68]Why am I in this car?
[41:37.78]Get out of this car and get a new one.
[41:39.72]One that's not going to be a piece of crap.
[41:41.50]Are you talking to me?
[41:44.78]Alright, just one of these guys is going to have...
[41:49.34]No, I need to just wait.
[41:50.32]Just wait in the middle of the road.
[41:51.48]Somebody eventually will drive the car up down here.
[41:53.18]I thought that on the left, I thought the tree was a giant cloaked monster.
[42:01.03]Audio is having a little bit of problems, but let's... Please.
[42:06.43]At least he stopped.
[42:07.11]Okay.
[42:15.58]Is that a clown?
[42:17.74]Why is there a clown driving this car?
[42:21.33]What is going on with this dude?
[42:28.13]What the fuck?
[42:33.51]Holy shit.
[42:35.23]Okay.
[42:36.81]This guy clearly has a green light.
[42:40.40]There's another one.
[42:43.14]This is actually scaring the shit out of me.
[42:44.54]This is so... This is freaking me out.
[42:49.80]Okay, now I'm going to take the can... That's a cannibal, right?
[42:53.90]Take your car.
[42:58.94]Now, let's go.
[43:01.74]Am I not noticing the glitched out textures?
[43:04.24]It's hard to pay attention to anything going on right now.
[43:11.10]Okay.
[43:14.36]Dude, I swear to God, the guy burping after he yelled at me was like... Top 10 funniest things I've seen so far in 2017.
[43:20.68]No.
[43:20.82]I'm sorry, but no.
[43:21.34]We need to do the first mission of the game.
[43:24.42]We need to do the first mission of the game.
[43:45.12]What am I doing?
[43:46.88]What's going on here?
[43:51.06]Check this spot out.
[43:53.90]For what?
[43:56.82]Am I looking for something?
[44:05.62]Oh, it's just behind me.
[44:09.88]Here we are.
[44:11.16]And I thought I was getting lost.
[44:13.01]Oh, that guy just got hit by the car.
[44:14.15]That would have been so funny.
[44:15.55]Alright, we go.
[44:16.79]First cutscene.
[44:18.09]Look, partner.
[44:19.86]I know the chief trusts you.
[44:21.38]But I've heard my share of stories.
[44:23.34]You are bad news.
[44:25.96]Yeah, I knew you were the classic goody two-shoes the minute I saw you.
[44:29.72]Probably still have your communion dress neatly hung up in your closet.
[44:32.74]You don't know me.
[44:33.51]I used to run with more than a few Latino gangs.
[44:36.55]I made mistakes, but I was lucky enough to get a second chance.
[44:39.59]And no one's gonna ruin it for me.
[44:41.34]You got it.
[44:41.74]I said no.
[44:42.54]Please leave.
[44:43.44]Sorry, Rosie.
[44:44.66]What'd you say?
[44:45.74]I come here to collect.
[44:47.44]Where the money?
[44:48.62]I already paid a triad every week, but this, too much.
[44:54.51]I really wish it was an Adam Sandler voice.
[44:56.47]I burn your place?
[44:58.13]What do you know, Rosie?
[44:59.29]It's my lucky day.
[45:00.77]Not only have I met your charming self, but I'll be closing this triad case by midnight.
[45:05.83]Yo, tough guy.
[45:07.41]Over here.
[45:07.89]Here we go.
[45:08.69]First boss fight.
[45:11.27]You make big mistake.
[45:15.72]Okay, let's do this.
[45:17.92]He just has that in his... Alright, well, I think that addled his brain because he's swinging in random directions.
[45:27.67]Can I pick up a chair?
[45:31.09]Please tell me I can pick a chair.
[45:32.81]If I can pick up a chair, you're talking about my favorite game ever made.
[45:39.17]Pick up item and throw item.
[45:45.82]Oh, for different combos.
[45:48.36]Oh, he just kicked me in the balls.
[45:49.48]Alright.
[45:51.42]Nice breakdance move.
[45:52.26]Alright, let's go.
[45:53.39]Shift.
[45:56.41]What?
[45:58.39]I wish it didn't give me number five, number four.
[46:01.87]Just kick it.
[46:04.79]Just kick it.
[46:05.35]I just monkey pawed him.
[46:07.72]And...
[46:14.84]Oh my good lord.
[46:15.80]Alright, we're coming back.
[46:19.10]How do you do the jump kick?
[46:28.70]What's jump... What am I talking about?
[46:32.38]What am I doing?
[46:33.44]No guns.
[46:33.98]He doesn't have a gun.
[46:34.74]Nah, let's do it honorably.
[46:49.58]I love this.
[46:50.10]No guns for you.
[46:52.90]When can this guy be done?
[46:55.00]Guns are overrated sometimes.
[46:57.24]See?
[46:57.88]What ass ain't just my license plate?
[47:00.10]No guns.
[47:02.08]Batman.
[47:04.14]You're dead, man.
[47:05.78]You hear?
[47:06.87]Dead.
[47:07.95]What's that?
[47:09.01]I can't hear you.
[47:09.59]Oh, you can't hear me either.
[47:11.07]What's Chinese for crazy?
[47:12.65]No way I'm going to work with you.
[47:14.07]You're out of control.
[47:15.03]I don't need this shit.
[47:16.11]Overly animated cut scenes.
[47:17.35]I love it.
[47:20.31]Rosie, to pick up a dropped firearm, stand over and press E. You can carry two weapons at a time.
[47:25.31]Rosie, wait.
[47:26.61]You forgot your fortune cookie.
[47:28.45]I know what it says.
[47:30.03]Beware of nutcases.
[47:33.29]Let me go.
[47:34.03]Here comes the first chase.
[47:36.08]Did you shoot her?
[47:39.92]Rosie, let me see where you... What are you doing?
[47:45.22]I'm so bad at shooting.
[47:49.53]That was just PogChamp!
[47:51.76]That was just a PogChamp face!
[47:54.36]I swear to God, roll that back!
[48:05.76]Did I win?
[48:07.90]Somebody run that back!
[48:09.94]That was actually just like the PogChamp face.
[48:15.84]Wow.
[48:17.00]What happened?
[48:17.78]Did I win?
[48:25.65]I need to watch this.
[48:27.29]I need to see that again.
[48:27.95]Stormtrooper aim.
[48:31.37]This actually is, honest to fucking god.
[48:47.71]That is truly, truly it on the screen.
[48:56.47]I was.
[48:57.75]Calm down, Jeremy.
[49:01.09]Alright, uh, we don't... Oh, fuck, I think I might have actually crashed the game.
[49:05.20]For real.
[49:05.52]Alright, let's bring it back if I can.
[49:16.95]That's crazy.
[49:19.19]Continue to bonus cruising.
[49:20.67]Story intermission.
[49:23.55]Bonus cruising.
[49:30.27]Drive to get a bonus upgrade.
[49:40.27]When did this game come out?
[49:41.03]This game came out in like 2004? 2003?
[49:51.70]What do I have to- I guess I have three options here?
[49:54.10]You can- 2005.
[49:54.44]2003.
[49:54.46]Alright, we're gonna do a street race.
[49:55.60]Let's make it happen.
[49:56.58]Uh, that's alright.
[49:57.36]I'll do this car.
[49:58.08]That's fine.
[49:58.96]Oh boy, don't even-
[50:21.48]Oh boy.
[50:32.88]Come on.
[50:34.30]Come on.
[50:35.46]Come on.
[50:36.82]Really?
[50:37.16]That would be stupid.
[50:45.91]I can't do that now.
[50:51.92]I wonder if I'm going to win the race.
[50:55.68]I actually might.
[50:56.96]They're probably brainless.
[51:02.29]I'll win.
[51:03.31]I'm still going to win this race.
[51:07.77]Yeah, look it.
[51:08.23]I'm already catching up.
[51:11.09]The game crashed.
[51:12.27]For real.
[51:13.01]The actual video game crashed.
[51:16.27]True Crime EXE has stopped working.
[51:19.23]So, okay, that's alright.
[51:22.39]Just keep going.
[51:23.07]This tends to happen every other time I play a video game.
[51:31.50]So let's go ahead and open it again.
[51:32.68]And give it a go.
[51:44.70]Huh.
[51:46.22]Now I don't even want to open.
[51:50.35]Interesting.
[51:56.13]There we go.
[51:56.69]Okay.
[51:57.47]Everything's saved.
[51:59.29]Saved.
[52:05.70]Mm-hmm.
[52:06.00]Resume game.
[52:06.74]This should hopefully... There we go.
[52:11.24]Select episode.
[52:12.06]Episode 2.
[52:15.21]Let's... Cruisin' for Leeds.
[52:21.01]Yeah, that's what we were.
[52:21.61]Alright, let's go.
[52:24.61]What is this?
[52:25.27]This is not the thing I just... I guess we skipped the bonus.
[52:28.10]Oh, well.
[52:28.92]Hey, Chief.
[52:29.58]How's Rosie?
[52:30.48]Lucky.
[52:31.24]The bullet went right through.
[52:33.32]Mad as hell, though.
[52:34.46]What can I say?
[52:35.46]I told you I work alone.
[52:36.66]Abandon all video games.
[52:38.50]I'll have Rosie work Intel for you from now on.
[52:41.34]Some QTEs to punch him in the face?
[52:43.24]What?
[52:43.96]Where did he go?
[52:44.68]I blinked and he's not on the table anymore.
[52:46.89]What happened?
[52:47.45]He fell?
[52:47.67]Alright.
[53:11.16]Drive to the destination.
[53:11.86]We're not going to mess around now.
[53:12.90]We're going right to the destination.
[53:15.10]Alright, no dicking around.
[53:21.02]No mugging reports.
[53:24.14]Dude, the greater good.
[53:25.04]We have to just actually continue with the story.
[53:28.68]I could be here all day.
[53:29.62]I do need to figure out what the actual handbrake is, though.
[53:38.16]On the mouse.
[53:43.20]I don't think... Well, the keyboard.
[53:46.86]Jesus.
[53:48.74]When you bounce into stuff, why does it sound like you're getting punched?
[53:51.08]Slapstick style.
[53:53.48]Okay, there's the actual map.
[53:54.88]It's G. Great sponsorship there.
[53:59.74]Number five.
[54:00.54]Yeah, but like... How the hell are you supposed to drive the car like that?
[54:03.59]Okay.
[54:11.12]Okay.
[54:12.24]You can dive out of cars in this game.
[54:13.92]I did not know that.
[54:14.94]Now I do.
[54:17.40]Here we go.
[54:18.54]Time for a fight.
[54:21.86]Gotta play Streets of New York next.
[54:25.21]I probably will if it's as fun as this.
[54:26.73]This is just outrageous.
[54:33.55]Hello?
[54:35.57]Anyone order Chinese?
[54:41.87]Time to learn new moves.
[54:42.57]Okay, so can we... Well, he can barely punch through wood.
[54:45.80]I guess that makes sense.
[54:46.86]He is like...
[55:10.30]He is a karate master, or whatever he is.
[55:12.10]I'm not sure what discipline he is, but he is wearing a robe.
[55:18.88]How do you do the jump kick?
[55:25.81]Go for a grab.
[55:30.93]No, let me get the grabs.
[55:32.75]He's got way more health than me.
[55:34.69]Oh, please.
[55:35.29]Where are you running to?
[55:47.23]Grab him.
[55:48.17]Nice drop.
[55:48.87]Nice.
[55:49.39]That was perfect.
[55:50.54]Grab.
[55:54.60]Go for the grab.
[55:56.00]Got it.
[56:04.54]Ah, come on.
[56:04.93]I could have got that off.
[56:06.77]Shit.
[56:07.01]There he is.
[56:12.53]Ground pound.
[56:14.42]Spin kick.
[56:15.92]Block it.
[56:17.49]Excellent.
[56:21.67]Can I end this now?
[56:23.17]Grab.
[56:25.61]Shit.
[56:26.27]Block.
[56:28.14]Ah, he's just like Smash Brothers.
[56:30.72]Exactly like Smash Brothers.
[56:31.86]If somebody goes for a block, you grab them.
[56:35.48]Pretty much in any fighting game, that's how you beat all your friends and they get so angry with you.
[56:40.52]Everybody that's just a dickhead that plays fighting games.
[56:44.60]Nobody grabs.
[56:45.96]They just try to do the fun Hadoukens.
[56:47.38]They don't go for the grabs.
[56:48.22]So you'll win every time against your friends if you grab them.
[56:50.70]Like half of your moves are grabs.
[56:52.46]You'll win every time.
[56:54.48]What's going on?
[56:57.18]Did I win?
[56:59.98]Not bad, big brother.
[57:01.80]I was getting worried you'd lost.
[57:03.10]I see you've been busy opening new gyms all around town.
[57:05.40]You have to parry?
[57:06.14]Go and franchise.
[57:07.56]Can you believe it?
[57:09.40]King's Chinese Laundry, less starch per stiff.
[57:11.48]Nick, stop screwing around.
[57:12.88]The Beamer has been spotted at the Red Lantern.
[57:15.10]Shoot, got a jet, bro.
[57:16.39]I'll catch you later.
[57:17.43]No worries.
[57:18.01]You've got free admission.
[57:19.13]24-7.
[57:19.69]Just stay out of trouble, okay?
[57:21.63]Evo, champ.
[57:22.17]Alright, Red Lantern Rush Episode 3.
[57:28.69]Race to the bar.
[57:29.39]60 seconds.
[57:31.88]Let's get there.
[57:41.02]How do I put the siren on?
[57:41.90]It's an E. Oh, I'm not in a police car.
[57:47.29]Wasn't I not in a police car anyways?
[57:48.75]It's all old people.
[57:50.79]These are all old people driving in front of me.
[57:52.31]Get out of the way.
[58:03.20]Beautiful.
[58:05.28]Beautiful.
[58:11.42]Car's trashed.
[58:12.20]It's alright, though.
[58:12.74]We just have to get there.
[58:13.40]We don't have to get there with a nice car.
[58:16.28]We just have to get there.
[58:17.18]Our bodies have to be sitting in a circle.
[58:18.68]I got 45 police points.
[58:19.42]Hey!
[58:19.54]Hey!
[58:19.62]You have a death wish?
[58:40.76]How come I don't have a knife?
[58:41.66]Can I grab something?
[58:44.28]A knife?
[58:49.85]Damn it.
[58:50.51]I'm gonna die here.
[58:52.07]I'm gonna die here.
[58:53.69]Grab the knife.
[59:04.76]Just wildly stab.
[59:05.78]Doesn't even matter.
[59:06.60]I have a weapon he don't.
[59:08.56]Just stab him.
[59:13.07]You're at a complete disadvantage.
[59:21.41]He's done.
[59:23.78]For a second, I was about to go attack the old man.
[59:25.40]I was like, no, that's not his.
[59:26.32]It's the guy he was punching.
[59:31.62]Does the grab use a knife?
[59:32.38]Oh, it's you throw the knife.
[59:34.75]I have to end it like that.
[59:38.35]Where's the knife?
[59:39.75]Oh shit, it's gone.
[59:40.97]That would've been amazing if I ended up throwing it in his head.
[59:44.66]Ow.
[59:44.76]Was it a Monty Python joke, really?
[59:49.72]The whole game is.
[59:50.38]You saved me!
[59:52.00]I fled, he chopped me good!
[60:18.56]All these cutscenes and all this gameplay is so strung together Chase him I can't wait to get new weapons.
[60:29.63]That's what I'm looking forward to I do have guns
[60:35.29]Although, I probably shouldn't.
[60:37.75]Will you run?
[60:39.09]What are you doing, man?
[60:40.03]Put your hands down.
[60:41.43]Run.
[60:43.72]Why are you doing this?
[60:45.14]There's no reason for this right now.
[60:47.28]He killed a guy.
[60:48.66]Run.
[60:52.30]I just dabbed and shot.
[60:53.44]You guys all saw it.
[60:54.12]And I hate to say that, but that's what actually happened.
[61:01.33]Let's catch up to him already.
[61:08.50]So, I'm gonna dive at him.
[61:15.12]Come on!
[61:15.80]That was clearly lined up.
[61:17.26]Like... Dude, before he kills again... No, now he has a gun.
[61:30.47]Okay.
[61:35.17]Get him!
[61:35.71]Grab him!
[61:45.85]Okay, we're back.
[61:56.36]Dude, the amount of times that, like, the game... ...minimizes... ...and... Let's just go.
[62:02.93]Continue the story.
[62:05.89]You, you, you... Sorry, Chief.
[62:08.13]I lost him.
[62:08.49]You can just go.
[62:10.57]I lost him.
[62:11.25]What?
[62:13.48]Hold on a second.
[62:14.58]You actually can go along with the story and he's still alive still.
[62:19.29]That's actually really cool.
[62:20.27]So you can just keep moving on.
[62:21.15]Sorry, I was just a clown.
[62:22.13]That's pretty cool.
[62:44.95]I like that aspect.
[62:45.75]You can actually not even worry about losing.
[62:57.76]Got him.
[62:58.70]Tackled him.
[62:59.94]That was a jump out of a car tackle.
[63:03.14]I'm hurting.
[63:07.18]Is there a doctor in the house?
[63:19.75]I did get that perfect, though.
[63:21.17]You gotta give me some credit.
[63:23.77]I cross-checked that guy.
[63:29.69]Shit, I missed!
[63:33.63]Oh, come on, no!
[63:35.03]Just continue the story.
[63:36.91]It's alright, never happened.
[63:38.45]Oops-a-daisy.
[63:51.88]Oh!
[63:54.61]That guy's just oblivious to everything going on.
[64:00.43]Ow!
[64:00.73]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
[64:01.61]What is this, a car wash?
[64:06.61]Let's do it.
[64:06.94]Let's do the car wash.
[64:07.92]Um... Oh, shit.
[64:08.64]I got this.
[64:09.44]I've never seen my spleen.
[64:22.02]Shit.
[64:22.96]And I had to... I blew it.
[64:25.61]God damn it.
[64:27.69]I can still get it.
[64:29.51]I can still get it.
[64:30.93]I'm gonna relax.
[64:34.15]Nobody move.
[64:37.84]Okay.
[64:50.54]No, I don't want to enter.
[64:55.65]What happens here?
[65:03.03]It's alright.
[65:08.83]I can get it.
[65:11.79]No, now I can't get it.
[65:12.59]It's like I was looking behind him now.
[65:21.06]Just murder him.
[65:22.22]Doesn't even matter.
[65:23.04]You don't even get in trouble.
[65:24.18]Murder!
[65:27.99]Suspect down.
[65:29.33]Now let me go in this car wash.
[65:34.29]Or car repair shop.
[65:35.09]I wanna see how this works.
[65:36.45]Open up.
[65:41.03]Can I spend my police points on something?
[65:46.12]Dude, I just saw what this was.
[65:49.60]And you're telling me that my brain cannot handle the fact that I just... No, let's be fair.
[65:56.87]I was not paying... I was paying attention to the fact that I was in a freeze frame about to tackle a guy, so... What is this, a gym?
[66:02.37]I don't care.
[66:02.81]I want to go learn some new moves.
[66:04.39]Combat training.
[66:05.08]Yes.
[66:05.24]This is all majorly important.
[66:20.23]Run toward opponent, then press num 6 for running kick.
[66:24.71]Ugh.
[66:27.59]That's so awesome.
[66:30.57]Alright, running punch, running kick.
[66:38.26]Okay.
[66:40.14]Okay, can you... Please, God.
[66:44.82]Like, that... You're talking about, like, what's the most frustrating thing you could possibly have?
[66:48.24]It's this.
[66:54.96]That's really cool.
[66:55.70]I like this slide tackle.
[66:56.66]I'm going to do it six more times.
[67:07.61]I would love this with a controller.
[67:08.73]You know, I really would, but I'm not even sure it's possible.
[67:11.63]The game probably won't even recognize the fact that I have a controller plugged in.
[67:18.81]You have to imagine, right?
[67:25.00]A lot of time left.
[67:33.97]Stretch the game window out?
[67:35.51]I'm not in a window.
[67:38.45]I'm not in a window.
[67:41.55]Practice again for free?
[67:42.51]No, thanks.
[67:45.64]The control options... Are there?
[67:46.94]Let me just... Let's go to options, just to see if it's possible.
[67:55.04]Controls.
[67:56.48]Keyboard, mouse.
[67:58.54]Keyboard, mouse, mouse, universe aim, mouse steering.
[68:02.28]I don't think there is a possibility.
[68:05.06]Am I going to play any other games tonight?
[68:12.58]No, this is it.
[68:14.31]Once we get our fill of this.
[68:15.99]I might even play this game again.
[68:19.23]Because...
[68:23.43]No, god damn it, dude.
[68:24.41]Come on, really?
[68:26.43]Just because I walked back over here?
[68:31.52]Oh, please.
[68:36.80]Should we play this game tomorrow night, too?
[68:41.43]Let me plug in the controller and just see what happens.
[68:44.03]Watch me crash the whole game in the stream at the same time.
[68:46.63]I wouldn't be surprised.
[68:49.79]This game does feel like it needs to be played with the controller.
[68:53.23]I clicked accept, did I really?
[68:54.61]I'm just so absent-minded sometimes.
[68:59.75]Let's see what happens if I plug a controller in.
[69:01.71]Plug this.
[69:12.30]Come on, get in there.
[69:12.92]Alright, let's see what happens.
[69:21.20]Okay.
[69:23.23]I might have to restart the game.
[69:30.93]Let me restart the game and see what happens.
[69:33.27]Exit.
[69:33.93]Yes.
[69:34.77]Exit the game.
[69:35.57]We're going to unplug.
[69:38.91]And then we're going to plug it back in.
[69:42.41]Alright, we're in.
[69:50.32]Open game.
[69:56.20]Uh-huh.
[69:59.32]And there it is.
[70:01.14]Let's see if we can get this to work.
[70:05.94]I hope so.
[70:11.22]Now we're having trouble opening it.
[70:12.58]Come on, man.
[70:15.90]Come on.
[70:16.48]There we go.
[70:21.44]Alright.
[70:23.22]Cross your fingers.
[70:25.85]Don't think it's possible.
[70:30.10]No.
[70:31.86]The controller looks like it's plugged in and turned on, but... Nope.
[70:39.31]Unfortunately.
[70:40.09]That's alright.
[70:43.31]I can handle it.
[70:43.81]It's not like it's a huge pain in the ass or anything.
[70:52.74]Bar brawl.
[70:53.88]Alt the arsonist.
[71:00.71]Let's do it.
[71:02.99]Press number six to use the emergency brake.
[71:05.71]Alright.
[71:20.48]I just really wish there was a way I could make it so the other screen wasn't really active.
[71:25.39]I have to turn it off, but I don't want to turn it off because then I can't see anything else on the screen.
[71:30.15]Please move.
[71:37.88]I love the slow-mo, but the mouse sensitivity is so high that it makes it impossible.
[71:46.72]Yeah, no music, because I won't be able to use it.
[71:49.62]It's copyright.
[71:51.88]I'll get the VOD turned off.
[71:53.04]Alright, this time he's not getting away.
[71:57.05]Alright.
[72:01.27]How do you survive an explosion?
[72:05.42]The car blew up and he got up and put his hands up.
[72:07.39]Did I arrest him?
[72:08.45]I hear you got the shooter's accomplice.
[72:10.55]Well done, Nick.
[72:12.09]Piece of cake, chief.
[72:13.29]Dropped him off at the precinct.
[72:14.73]He's one of Jimmy Fu's posse.
[72:16.23]Everyone's a mutant in this game.
[72:17.43]Yeah, I know.
[72:18.15]Jimmy's small time.
[72:19.34]He must be working for someone bigger.
[72:21.22]I'm heading to Jimmy's place now.
[72:22.82]Nick, just be careful.
[72:24.78]Roadkill on the ground.
[72:27.48]Just me, car, and the road.
[72:29.40]Let's go.
[72:29.74]That's joyriding.
[72:33.88]Starsky and Hutch.
[72:36.42]Is it the car?
[72:45.79]I'm not gonna play the Neighbors From Hell music.
[72:53.93]Got a gun range.
[73:00.91]I do see a nice car.
[73:03.17]Why would you get up?
[73:05.25]Why wouldn't you just cross it over?
[73:06.65]So you have to like cut him off.
[73:08.29]You can't just let him drive.
[73:09.35]Alright, there we go.
[73:14.08]Now I'll be able to get it.
[73:16.94]Gotta make an impossible route for them to go.
[73:20.04]Now I have a super fast car.
[73:24.11]Watch this one.
[73:27.83]I'm not playing Neighbors from Hell.
[73:32.94]Why do you guys want to hear that shit?
[73:38.74]That was elevator music.
[73:40.44]2.0.
[73:40.76]And away we go.
[73:58.79]Well, that was... I got .57 seconds in the air.
[74:06.47]You backed into that, dude.
[74:07.87]I didn't even hit you.
[74:09.39]Why are you running into the car?
[74:11.63]He's just jumping into the way.
[74:13.11]I'm not even gonna do it.
[74:14.15]Horseshit.
[74:29.11]Oh, is it on the way?
[74:30.17]One of them's on the way.
[74:33.40]Try to get this one.
[74:42.54]Okay, just get up.
[74:43.36]I gotta get up closer.
[74:44.22]Mm-hmm.
[74:48.76]Get me up there.
[74:49.42]Give me the, give me the Rectical.
[74:51.60]Give me the, give me the good, ah, there's a jump here.
[74:53.56]I don't care about anything else.
[74:54.82]Nothing else matters.
[74:59.48]I only care about this.
[75:00.58]Let's try it.
[75:08.92]And away we go.
[75:13.60]Sick!
[75:17.26]That wasn't good.
[75:17.82]I gotta do it again.
[75:25.81]All three suspects escaped.
[75:27.89]Who cares?
[75:32.60]Hit the jump.
[75:33.18]I feel like I could go much faster than this, but... Where is it?
[75:41.43]Where'd the jump go?
[75:43.43]Put the gun down.
[75:44.11]Put the gun down.
[75:56.79]I want to put the gun down.
[75:59.31]Where's the jump?
[75:59.77]Did I break the jump?
[76:03.06]Are you kidding me?
[76:04.74]That's annoying.
[76:08.64]I destroyed it?
[76:09.48]I thought that was a tree!
[76:15.20]That game is stu- That guy just did the pop-tarts!
[76:19.17]The crazy good?
[76:21.50]Crazy good.
[76:23.42]Why are there random references in this game that are... That's an erection.
[76:27.73]So we're going to go away from that because that's getting somebody in trouble on twitch.tv.
[76:33.40]So see you later.
[76:43.54]What is this?
[76:44.70]Is this guy a pyromaniac?
[76:46.24]I'm not sure what's going on, but everyone's looking at me like Dark Souls enemies.
[76:54.97]This is the pyromaniac.
[77:14.15]Okay The two like tweedledee and tweedledum just decided to start like rocking out Go this way
[77:44.35]That arrest was buttery smooth.
[77:47.85]The game does run at 60.
[77:56.02]Mugging report.
[77:57.64]I just want more... Sure.
[78:06.80]I will take your word for it, game.
[78:15.59]Trying to get out of here.
[78:16.43]I just want to get out of here Hey guys guess what happened I'll give you two guesses
[78:45.13]I was in a place I wasn't supposed to be.
[78:50.39]Ruined everything.
[78:55.49]Thankfully, we can just start from... the cutscene.
[79:02.38]We keep just catching the sto- no, wait, wait, what?
[79:05.14]What?
[79:05.36]Didn't we already do this?
[79:16.17]Why are we changing timelines here?
[79:18.01]Okay, so we have changed timeline.
[79:26.09]We got into the game, we... They say I made the Life is Strange joke, and all of a sudden now we're doing it.
[79:37.80]He's very bad at this.
[79:41.10]He killed me last time, I think.
[79:42.24]That's what happened, right?
[79:47.81]Let me get this lined up right.
[79:52.23]Easy.
[79:52.55]Right in the head.
[79:56.33]Right in the head.
[79:57.35]Right in the head.
[80:09.30]Shit!
[80:10.24]Just please, thank you for appearing!
[80:11.97]Thank you for appearing, car!
[80:13.65]Oh my god, I'm just trying to... Don't let him get away.
[80:15.75]I'm gonna get like the bad end again.
[80:21.92]The save still lives, we still go on the same timeline anyways.
[80:33.09]I'm just, I'm murdering this guy in cold blood.
[80:46.06]Come on.
[80:48.18]Come on!
[80:49.68]No!
[80:55.67]Is it crashed?
[80:59.85]No, it's not.
[81:00.39]It's coming back.
[81:00.95]Hold on.
[81:01.29]Wait, wait, wait.
[81:05.60]Is it?
[81:09.44]It is.
[81:09.70]We're good.
[81:10.06]We're good.
[81:10.30]We're good.
[81:10.54]We're okay.
[81:12.16]No, we're not.
[81:16.58]This game is like struggling.
[81:21.86]Get back.
[81:23.14]Okay.
[81:24.10]We're good.
[81:32.19]I hear you got the shooter's...
[81:35.83]This thing's gonna explode in the cutscene.
[81:38.47]Oh, come on.
[81:38.79]Explode in the cutscene.
[81:40.00]Please.
[81:40.22]Oh, that's too bad.
[81:40.88]If that blew up during the cutscene and I died and I failed, you wouldn't be able to get me back.
[81:44.94]I'd be gone forever.
[82:07.83]We have to jump over here somewhere.
[82:09.39]I don't care.
[82:11.65]We're just going to the mission because we need to separate these five realities we have.
[82:15.08]Easy.
[82:15.30]Just let me hit every object.
[82:16.34]That works.
[82:16.64]Might as well.
[82:40.82]All the budget went into the Staples Center licensing.
[82:44.54]I mean, back in the day, more than 10 years ago, this was pretty... I'm sure this was pretty revolutionary.
[82:53.94]Being able to drive around, open world.
[82:56.00]Like, GTA came out, and then everybody made their own GTA 3.
[83:02.49]Wait, that's not funny.
[83:09.57]This thing is going to blow, and I do need to be very careful.
[83:17.80]Can't... Can't slide.
[83:23.36]This is just crazy taxi.
[83:26.14]You can actually kill people.
[83:29.36]There we go.
[83:29.74]Right up here in the state house.
[83:31.92]What?
[83:32.18]Why is it on fire?
[83:33.10]Ah, fuck it.
[83:33.56]We're taking it.
[83:58.13]Wait, one of the old guys pulled a gun on one of the other old guys!
[84:02.40]Oh shit, I messed up!
[84:03.92]I got the wrong old guy!
[84:06.40]No, you move!
[84:07.60]You stay right there!
[84:09.28]Don't you fucking move!
[84:12.99]No, he came back out from the steps.
[84:17.99]Come on, die!
[84:19.31]Get over here!
[84:23.26]They're pulling the guns on each other.
[84:26.40]Alright, we're good.
[84:36.86]What was it?
[84:37.86]A dispute with those three senators?
[84:39.62]What the hell was that?
[84:42.18]Those three old guys playing billiards.
[84:44.10]Did somebody do something wrong?
[84:50.95]I don't think this car is going to explode.
[84:56.77]I really don't think so.
[84:58.59]It's had every opportunity to blow up.
[85:00.29]It just won't.
[85:02.00]I'm desperately trying to make it happen.
[85:10.31]No, it's not gonna blow.
[85:15.65]Eve, I don't... Eve is shooting this... I gotta dive out.
[85:21.04]That's the proper way to get out of a car with no door.
[85:25.96]Now it exploded.
[85:26.62]Alright, well that's fine.
[85:29.32]Let's just keep going.
[85:39.11]I only have five seconds left.
[85:47.18]There's now a sneak.
[85:50.28]Sneak into the warehouse.
[85:52.46]Hold C to take cover.
[85:59.61]Remain hidden from view or your enemies will notice you.
[86:02.55]We got glass.
[86:05.23]I was trying to pick up the glass.
[86:10.17]No, I wanted to pick up the item.
[86:11.71]I thought it was like I could slash his throat or something.
[86:13.89]I was picking up... Oh my fucking god.
[86:28.04]Please get back over here.
[86:30.86]Yeah, kick him good.
[86:34.52]I'm replaying this mission.
[86:38.34]Well, it's a blinking item on the ground.
[86:42.14]I thought I could walk up to it and pick it up and use it as a weapon.
[86:45.13]Alright, remain hidden.
[86:49.23]Sure.
[86:50.91]Now, what do I do?
[86:51.79]Press punch to stun him.
[86:55.17]Good call.
[86:55.63]Press E to perform a deadly attack.
[87:01.29]We're not playing a good guy here.
[87:02.32]Didn't see me coming, did you?
[87:04.83]Tranquilizer gun.
[87:05.65]This weapon has a limited range in ammo, so use it sparingly.
[87:09.84]Yeah, we're concentrated evil.
[87:11.72]This run, guys.
[87:13.28]If you're curious.
[87:17.28]I shot him right in the crotch area.
[87:20.69]Directly into his penis.
[87:24.85]Didn't even mean to.
[87:25.51]Alright, what do we got?
[87:27.51]We got... Anybody over here?
[87:30.11]We got one guy over there.
[87:36.22]That's it going across his view.
[87:44.76]I don't understand.
[87:45.48]Is this a Nerf gun?
[87:50.76]This is a Nerf gun from like 1991.
[87:51.88]No more bullets.
[88:04.33]Stunned.
[88:05.85]Stunned.
[88:11.25]Well, he's dead.
[88:12.15]I guess he's dead.
[88:13.16]He's not stunned.
[88:15.06]Oh, shit.
[88:27.78]Break his neck.
[88:30.17]Alright, we made it.
[88:34.20]To the first, uh... The first checkpoint, I guess.
[88:42.44]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[88:45.58]Karate chop!
[88:46.10]We're good.
[88:52.02]I am the shadow that walks.
[88:54.74]Oh, lord.
[88:55.36]It's suspiciously quiet here.
[89:03.49]There's a lot of just random one-on-one fights, huh?
[89:06.13]Shoot Jimmy's crew.
[89:08.31]What happened to the... I don't think headshots even exist in this game.
[89:16.36]I'm fairly certain of that.
[89:36.62]Alright, definitely want that gun.
[89:37.70]You can shoot them both at the same time.
[89:43.40]And where am I being shot from?
[89:44.98]That guy.
[89:45.36]Alright, now I get that cool gun.
[89:52.25]Nice.
[89:52.73]That's actually pretty cool.
[89:53.59]You get double weapons.
[89:55.13]Wow!
[89:55.77]Didn't even see him.
[89:59.49]Switch it out, but it keeps swapping.
[90:08.65]Alright, we're good.
[90:10.89]Switch that one out too.
[90:16.71]No, I want... Give me that one.
[90:25.22]I'm so confused at what's actually happening, guys.
[90:27.20]I'm not even kidding.
[90:29.96]We're alright.
[90:30.94]We're doing fine.
[90:31.56]I just need to...
[90:43.57]No, come on.
[90:46.73]No, come on.
[90:49.71]Get over it, dude.
[90:50.93]Just do it right.
[90:58.48]What was blocking that?
[91:00.24]I would like you to look at this.
[91:01.84]Take a look.
[91:02.18]There's bullet holes.
[91:04.20]Right there.
[91:04.52]You saw it.
[91:05.02]You saw it.
[91:07.48]I don't need to say it again.
[91:08.24]I was shooting an invisible wall.
[91:17.23]Oh man, that was the worst thing I've ever heard.
[91:27.18]Oh my god.
[91:29.24]Oh my god, that was so bad.
[91:31.38]I don't know what to do.
[91:32.52]I think I need to go take a bath after that one.
[91:37.62]Yeah.
[91:38.32]Get some eucalyptus in there.
[91:42.04]What?
[91:42.34]No, pick that back up.
[91:45.82]I just don't want to get collapsed on.
[91:56.69]Easy.
[91:57.11]That guy ate bullets.
[92:00.25]Good.
[92:02.35]Fresh heal.
[92:03.07]Somebody behind me.
[92:06.77]I'm just staying back here.
[92:08.56]Fuck it.
[92:10.14]Forget that.
[92:18.94]One guy left.
[92:19.44]Is there any bullets in them?
[92:25.64]Yes.
[92:29.19]Now, my guy's up top.
[92:32.11]He jumps over on his own.
[92:33.11]Yep, there it is.
[92:36.85]Dramatic effect.
[92:51.43]Just die already.
[92:55.17]Alright, can we please be done?
[92:58.49]Oh my lord, I'm gonna lose.
[92:59.95]I'm gonna lose right now.
[93:13.38]Oh my god.
[93:14.88]Fucking Johnny Cage.
[93:16.90]I can't kill him.
[93:20.76]Go back to Mortal Kombat.
[93:22.50]Jesus.
[93:23.04]Really?
[93:23.26]Nice moves.
[93:23.84]Alright, shoot the sniper.
[93:52.23]Alright, well, the sniper is not very good.
[93:59.01]He shot the trash can in front of him.
[94:03.45]Okay, yep.
[94:04.39]He's just hitting every object.
[94:06.22]He's not actually hitting me with anything.
[94:09.34]Nice try.
[94:10.74]Nice cereal box discount, sniper.
[94:14.42]Oh, wow, you're great at this.
[94:19.60]Oh, ow!

[99:03.09]You know what I mean?
[99:05.79]I just swiped that person off like they were dust on a table.
[99:14.86]The music's not... The music is playing right now.
[99:21.78]Jeremy, you just... Oh, oh, I see it.
[99:23.78]Yeah, good, good, good.
[99:26.14]Alright, no, no, no, no.
[99:27.90]I'm going to turn this up a little bit louder.
[99:29.93]This just has to be music right now.
[99:31.75]Because you guys have to help me here with this joke.
[99:35.91]Only music.
[99:41.28]We have to make sure this gets picked up by the... Wait.
[99:45.65]Hold on.
[100:01.60]Come on.
[100:02.06]I can't talk right now.
[100:06.89]Why?
[100:07.57]Honest to God, dude.
[100:09.41]You piece of fucking shit.
[100:12.97]Like, just... I know.
[100:13.99]I know.
[100:14.63]Please get away from this.
[100:15.81]I wish I could just get out of here.
[100:18.07]I wish I could.
[100:22.87]Oh my God.
[100:23.69]Okay.
[100:25.65]Why is there still audio?
[100:31.95]What?
[100:32.11]Forget it, okay?
[100:32.83]And the music's going off.
[100:33.94]You gotta put one mission.
[100:35.02]That mission was rescue the hostage.
[101:01.52]I was gonna do a thing where everyone was talking all this great stuff about me and everyone was saying how cool I was and how interesting I was.
[101:08.04]And how deep the conversation was.
[101:10.70]And, wow, dude, I really didn't think you were this smart.
[101:12.61]Like, nuclear physics?
[101:14.47]That's crazy.
[101:16.21]You're completely changing my ideas on quantum theory.
[101:18.39]That would've been funny.
[101:21.05]Now we don't get to be funny.
[101:24.83]That would've been so funny.
[101:25.87]That was a mission.
[101:40.85]Am I even aiming at him?
[101:41.79]Alright, his vehicle's been stopped.
[101:47.99]Got him.
[101:50.35]Didn't even matter.
[101:54.38]I still, like, ran him over anyways.
[102:00.36]Slow down, citizen!
[102:04.72]This cop is just gonna die.
[102:07.72]Like, there's no escaping this.
[102:10.24]Apparently there is.
[102:13.96]Crazy good!
[102:26.64]Forget it.
[102:27.00]It wasn't meant to be.
[102:35.51]We have to watch that ad just so we can know what I'm talking about.
[102:40.11]Some of you probably do, some of you don't.
[102:44.42]Is this The Simpsons hit and run?
[102:46.86]It sure does feel like it.
[102:51.88]Alright.
[103:06.48]Both suspects defeated instantly.
[103:13.90]I can't control the car.
[103:14.99]That's how I just enter normally.
[103:25.13]Alright, here we go.
[103:27.17]Good.
[103:27.43]Here comes Christopher Walken.
[103:28.69]Rosie.
[103:30.31]Why the long face, kiddo?
[103:31.99]Let me guess.
[103:34.51]You got yourself a new partner?
[103:36.81]I don't mean any disrespect, but why Nick?
[103:39.03]You forgot I was a cop?
[103:40.15]But he gets the job done, Rosie.
[103:42.31]Yeah, he's a bit rough around the edges, but growing up as an orphan would screw with anybody's head.
[103:47.80]Come on, everyone's had it tough.
[103:49.72]So what?
[103:50.46]Nah, not like Nick.
[103:52.60]First, his mother died.
[103:54.36]She was a dear soul.
[103:56.16]Then, Father Henry got fingered in a drug trafficking scandal and simply disappeared.
[104:04.99]I've heard about this.
[104:06.41]Henry Wilson, right?
[104:07.94]No wonder trouble runs in the family.
[104:09.80]Somebody just said.
[104:11.02]Jesus Christ, that eye shadow.
[104:12.00]Now that I'm looking at it, it does seem like a lot.
[104:30.71]Is that a lot?
[104:31.41]I'm not your goddamn sidekick, Kang.
[104:34.72]I don't know.
[104:35.82]Just try not to shoot yourself in the foot, okay?
[104:40.40]That wasn't too hard, was it?
[104:42.14]I wish he had it, too.
[104:46.12]Alright.
[104:47.69]We're driving a limo.
[104:54.87]It's too much.
[105:01.65]Alright, tail is limo.
[105:08.35]I'm falling behind.
[105:09.27]I didn't even get a chance.
[105:15.40]There we are.
[105:16.56]Now I'm not falling behind.
[105:17.62]I guess I still am falling behind.
[105:19.30]Damn.
[105:23.70]He's right there.
[105:24.70]I can see him.
[105:25.76]No, we're not... We're not continuing the mission.
[105:33.25]Just go.
[105:35.25]Don't tackle someone.
[105:38.58]They really don't give you a chance.
[105:41.94]You have to have a car right next to you.
[105:43.52]Don't get too close, though.
[105:44.28]I've seen how these games work.
[105:45.18]Don't want to get too close.
[105:52.27]Don't be too far away, though, at the same time.
[105:55.65]Just barely enough.
[106:02.16]I thought my license plate was Jerma.
[106:03.96]Why is it too swag?
[106:07.95]Was that even a thing that people were saying back in like 2003?
[106:13.89]Swag?
[106:14.37]That's like 2011.
[106:18.05]This game has a lot of weird time travel shit in it. ...
[106:36.76]Hey, can I can I get the position that I need to be in please?
[106:43.66]Alright here we go, pull in He's going way too fast Slow it down, rein it in here Hit the brakes, hit the brakes!
[107:20.66]I just heard an explosion.
[107:21.60]His car didn't explode.
[107:24.08]Why?
[107:31.14]I'm gonna get the bad end now.
[107:37.59]Alright, let's go.
[107:42.93]Driving to the spa.
[107:47.07]Press E, Z, or... That's the guy that held the gun.
[107:49.65]He lived.
[107:50.11]So what was it?
[107:50.57]It was E. What else was it?
[108:13.30]Okay, it was E. Does the guy have any drugs on him?
[108:18.67]What was that?
[108:19.91]X?
[108:20.23]What was the other one?
[108:26.61]I'm going to check everybody.
[108:30.99]Oh.
[108:31.81]Alright.
[108:32.83]You're under arrest.
[108:34.81]You had a gun on you.
[108:35.67]What about you now?
[108:42.82]Okay.
[108:47.59]I do like the fact that you can just, like, walk up to people and say... Alright, get out of the car.
[108:53.99]Out of the car.
[108:55.87]I want to check and see what you got on you.
[108:57.11]Here.
[108:59.37]Now, the suspect is now running.
[109:02.19]Suspect on foot.
[109:05.25]You definitely have, like, a pound of weed in your back pocket.
[109:07.39]Guaranteed.
[109:07.81]You're under arrest.
[109:11.96]Why would you run?
[109:13.04]Why would you run this fast?
[109:17.32]Got him.
[109:20.50]What about your twin brother?
[109:27.04]What about you?
[109:27.60]What about the guy on the cell phone?
[109:32.32]Both suspects escaped.
[109:34.22]Well, I just frisk every innocent person.
[109:37.78]Eventually, one of you guys has to have drugs.
[109:40.07]Somebody has drugs!
[109:41.89]Yup, found an illegal weapon.
[109:44.53]I knew it.
[109:49.36]That was a pretty cool illegal weapon.
[109:54.82]What about you?
[110:02.04]Found illegal drugs.
[110:12.79]Okay, I didn't expect that.
[110:13.67]I didn't expect that to happen.
[110:16.23]I didn't expect that to happen.
[110:22.59]He's just randomly fishing.
[110:29.14]I thought he was gonna disappear into mud.
[110:30.98]I didn't think it was gonna be like a real...
[110:52.09]Alright, it's time to... Okay, alright.
[110:58.92]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[111:00.56]We're done.
[111:01.14]We're done with this shit.
[111:02.12]Give me the car.
[111:03.81]Why?
[111:04.09]It's not even... It's a tab.
[111:05.67]I am never gonna get used to that.
[111:09.05]Oh, wait a minute.
[111:10.51]Sir.
[111:11.31]Sir, do you have any weapons on you?
[111:21.50]Come here.
[111:21.92]I just want to fucking find out if you have drugs on you.
[111:25.22]I'm trying to clean up these streets once and for all.
[111:30.94]Well, it's alright.
[111:33.24]I put him in jail anyways.
[111:37.00]Bye.
[111:38.34]You're stuck in there forever.
[111:42.91]Let's go.
[111:45.37]Really motivated cop.
[111:50.27]You know, sometimes it's tricky being on these streets and trying to find out who could and who potentially could be and couldn't be a criminal.
[111:59.24]It's a tough... First time I had drugs on him!
[112:03.44]Come here!
[112:05.92]It is a possibility!
[112:10.94]That's alright, you got lucky.
[112:16.01]Did he get in the car?
[112:16.75]He's in the car with me.
[112:20.56]Am I losing my mind or is that guy in the car?
[112:28.88]Did somebody say drugs?
[112:35.67]I'm concerned if he's in the car.
[112:39.07]I'm losing my mind.
[112:40.47]Mind is lost.
[112:43.37]You should be able to plant evidence.
[112:45.29]Jesus.
[112:49.45]Why am I chasing this person?
[113:00.34]Alright.
[113:01.37]We are just... He's just too fast.
[113:04.25]My car can't go as fast as his.
[113:06.75]And... I think I'm about to give up here.
[113:12.11]Yeah.
[113:14.46]Yeah, we give up.
[113:35.89]Everybody's a fucking criminal in my town.
[113:44.65]Alright, let's just go to the mission.
[113:49.35]Just waiting for that guy to run by me.
[113:54.19]He escaped.
[113:54.69]Who cares?
[113:59.40]Can you actually go to the airport?
[114:04.88]Bel Air.
[114:05.56]Okay, I'm reading that as if that's the airport.
[114:10.47]It's like the Bel Air is the airport.
[114:13.99]Bel Air is a town in
[114:19.16]I need to get like food in my bloodstream.
[114:25.47]No.
[114:25.73]No.
[114:26.21]Alright, turn.
[114:26.61]Watch out.
[114:45.04]Darn his wave.
[114:49.12]Left.
[114:51.53]Now!
[115:08.94]Just hit every piece of the fence.
[115:13.36]Just incorporate yourself in like a fence immolation aura.
[115:20.81]Why can't I just go fast through this?
[115:23.11]Come on!
[115:23.63]I had my fence bone shield from Diablo II.
[115:32.72]Oh.
[115:33.42]Sorry about that.
[115:35.34]Turma sucks.
[115:44.20]I'm gonna slide tackle.
[115:45.50]You know, hold on.
[115:46.10]We gotta get a good still frame here.
[115:47.90]Oh, please.
[115:50.26]God, stop doing that.
[115:56.60]I really want to slide tackle someone.
[116:00.15]What's a slide?
[116:00.71]How do you kick?
[116:03.27]Like... That's... Painful.
[116:15.71]You run and you slide, right?
[116:18.28]I wanna get a good freeze frame.
[116:20.10]No, whatever.
[116:20.50]This guy just attacked me.
[116:27.26]That guy, like, slashed me with a knife.
[116:44.53]Nice.
[116:44.91]I just failed.
[116:45.59]That was just on Jeopardy.
[116:47.15]On Jeopardy.
[116:48.87]When Alex Trebek asks you a question.
[117:12.03]That's the sound it makes leading up to when the question is about to be answered and if you don't answer in time.
[117:21.16]This is Jeopardy.
[117:23.92]Continue the mission.
[117:27.04]So I do actually get caught.
[117:29.52]Alex Trebek doesn't... Yes he does.
[117:31.58]Let's host this show.
[117:32.82]Alex Trebek has been the host of Jeopardy since they've been digging for gold.
[117:35.68]You understand?
[117:58.06]You understand?
[117:59.00]You understand?
[117:59.56]Don't click off the screen.
[118:04.06]I'm not even in windowed mode.
[118:09.12]It's in full screen exclusive.
[118:31.19]I can actually break into the toilets.
[118:32.45]Alright, this is one dead.
[118:39.01]How many more dead guys do we need?
[118:46.98]I can't say I'm like super, super... I kind of don't want to do this three more times.
[118:52.22]Grab him.
[119:02.95]Nice, nice Half-Life 1 jump sound.
[119:09.90]Come on, get him.
[119:10.72]Come here.
[119:23.59]One more monkey punch.
[119:24.37]Whatever's gone.
[119:27.89]Okay, I thought that guy had an axe in the back of his head.
[119:29.99]It's just a long, weird, skinny rat tail.
[119:42.03]What was that?
[119:44.85]Dropping down real low there for a second.
[119:51.03]I must prefer... Half-Life doesn't have a jump sound?
[119:56.07]That's a Half-Life 1 sound.
[119:58.03]That's clearly a Half-Life sound, but I don't know.
[120:00.43]Maybe it's a jump, or is it... It might be you try to take something that doesn't exist anymore.
[120:05.86]No, that goes like... What is...
[120:15.98]He's down, okay.
[120:17.86]Now we just have to do the rat tail guy.
[120:20.18]Be good.
[120:21.64]Is that now a weapon?
[120:22.50]I hope it is.
[120:24.20]Please, weapon?
[120:25.86]Alright, die.
[120:38.49]Ow, my hand.
[120:41.61]Those are broken bones in my tibia.
[120:43.88]I can't get those back.
[120:49.40]It's gonna take like 40 years for my bones to grow in the right way.
[120:52.31]Alright, I'm gonna lose if I don't... I'm gonna have to keep continuing the story.
[121:00.23]Don't lose here.
[121:05.62]Thank God.
[121:10.24]I didn't do the please no guns thing.
[121:15.71]Isn't this the guy that I... Did I just beat this guy up?
[121:21.24]Oh.
[121:21.44]This guy clearly has a muscle suit on.
[121:38.87]Or he's a turtle.
[121:39.59]I'm not sure.
[121:39.95]It's Geralt.
[121:40.25]Geralt of Riviera.
[121:41.45]Sick.
[121:41.55]Sweet backflip into a take cover situation.
[122:10.13]Alright, everyone wants me to turn on the music.
[122:13.74]Fine.
[122:14.58]You get one notch.
[122:21.38]That's it.
[122:32.60]You can't even hear it.
[122:35.08]It's inaudible.
[122:42.73]It's actually kind of fair.
[122:43.77]It's nice having a background there.
[122:50.81]I missed every shot.
[122:52.05]I don't know how.
[122:56.55]I'm just going to rope around in a circle here.
[122:58.64]Double dual shotguns.
[122:59.72]I love it.
[123:01.44]I love the idea.
[123:06.38]How many more?
[123:06.90]Anybody else?
[123:07.90]We good?
[123:08.88]Have we cleared it?
[123:12.03]Not yet.
[123:16.86]The max pain mode is not good.
[123:20.45]But it's not like it's going to win any awards anyways.
[123:32.80]Done.
[123:34.56]Couple shotguns.
[123:36.22]Come on.
[123:36.98]Just like that Overwatch game.
[123:41.84]Just like Overwatch.
[123:43.46]You drop them and you pick up two new ones.
[123:49.33]Just role-playing as Reaper.
[124:00.40]That's gotta be it, right?
[124:08.06]Don't give me like a, that was a bad joke.
[124:10.22]That's a good reference.
[124:12.68]I'm throwing down shotguns and picking up two new ones every time I reload.
[124:19.86]Are you guys really gonna give me this shit for this one?
[124:25.52]By the way... No, why?
[124:28.17]This is the last guy, right here.
[124:40.10]Not done.
[124:40.50]This is the la- what?
[124:44.34]Please!
[124:44.70]I only have- look at my health!
[124:51.53]Not a joke anymore, thank God.
[124:54.67]What in the... Why would I allow that to happen?
[125:00.23]Why would that just happen?
[125:03.42]Why would he give me a cutscene and the guy sneaks behind me and shoots me?
[125:08.24]That doesn't seem very fair at all.
[125:13.80]I'm... Alright, just gotta make it happen.
[125:23.90]I feel like I have a hundred bullets.
[125:30.20]Pick up the gun!
[125:38.77]Don't get collapsed on from behind here.
[125:47.36]How far into the game am I?
[125:48.88]I feel like this is pretty significant.
[126:00.30]More music.
[126:05.39]You get what you want.
[126:06.01]You get what you ask for in this stream.
[126:07.41]Unless it involves food.
[126:10.53]There we go.
[126:15.61]Who ever made this menu?
[126:22.62]Hope you get coal for Christmas next year.
[126:31.16]Say, there.
[126:31.60]Give me enough time to shoot you.
[126:42.42]Pick up the gun!
[126:43.08]A-haaaa!
[126:52.17]Getting there.
[126:55.99]Stop!
[126:56.57]And my cursor's not even on the other monitor!
[127:00.08]Oh, this is infuriating.
[127:02.99]This just absolutely just makes me want to die.
[127:05.25]This music kind of sounds out of key.
[127:20.78]Oh, God.
[127:27.01]Just feed him out.
[127:28.11]That's the big rush there.
[127:29.63]And then there's one more guy.
[127:30.61]And then here comes the boss, right?
[127:31.67]Alright, gotta be ready.
[127:34.75]Here he comes.
[127:36.96]I think that's it.
[127:37.52]One more.
[127:37.80]One more.
[127:38.06]Here comes the boss.
[127:39.70]Through this door.
[127:40.46]You're gonna walk in.
[127:41.04]I'm gonna shoot him.
[127:46.18]That's unbelievable.
[127:48.16]Unbelievable.
[127:50.14]The guy's behind me.
[127:59.48]Don't you even think... I'm gonna get shot in the face accidentally and it's gonna ruin everything.
[128:08.67]He's still alive.
[128:15.71]And I have no more guns.
[128:18.05]I just have the guy in Austin Powers that's Dr. Evil's best friend.
[128:26.29]What's his name?
[128:26.77]Number 2.
[128:35.96]Thank God.
[128:41.52]International ties.
[128:43.28]Finale victory.
[128:45.66]I didn't complete the whole thing, but it's alright.
[128:50.39]Replay episode.
[128:57.67]What?
[129:01.94]What do you mean replay?
[129:03.18]Fail to achieve 100% completion.
[129:11.29]They're just blasting death metal now.
[129:19.19]What am I doing?
[129:19.77]Can I not?
[129:20.53]Can I beat the game?
[129:31.55]You know what?
[129:33.19]Death metal, in quotes.
[129:35.33]Death metal.
[129:36.17]It's just death metal.
[129:46.92]They're phrasing Satan.
[129:50.52]And it's talking about killing and dying.
[129:53.67]See?
[129:58.46]He's swearing.
[129:59.10]So I don't have any more missions left.
[130:11.71]That's the guy... That's the guy that I just killed, but different.
[130:15.35]He's like another fat guy with a big suit on.
[130:19.15]We're at that stage right now where every GTA NPC gets like... Look, there it is!
[130:24.03]Look, look, look, look, look!
[130:28.06]Every NPC just gets spawned.
[130:30.02]And that's a carjacker!
[130:31.46]That's a carjacker!
[130:32.21]I can't even get, like, a good, like, fucking game flow, because it keeps alt-tapping me over and over again.
[130:38.95]He's gone.
[130:46.00]Forget it.
[130:47.50]Uh, what do I do now?
[130:50.68]Solve eight crimes.
[130:51.90]I actually have to do that.
[130:59.05]So, did I beat the game?
[131:01.29]And is this just bonus stuff?
[131:02.77]Or did I... Well, we're gonna find... No.
[131:18.05]It never ends.
[131:19.95]It's just padding.
[131:22.57]It's just filler.
[131:23.51]Alright, it's just filler.
[131:24.77]Alright, that's fine.
[131:26.54]Suspect escaped.
[131:27.24]We'll just wait until somebody else becomes another suspect.
[131:30.40]Shouldn't take that long.
[131:37.71]Alright, so now we're looking for more like murderers and criminals and shooters and drug dealers and we're just gonna sit here and wait for it to happen.
[131:46.07]Okay, there's a bus.
[131:46.95]That's a crime bus.
[131:49.39]That's a crime bus if I've ever seen one.
[131:56.49]Oh, well.
[131:57.69]Alright, uh, again.
[131:58.61]Let's look for some more murderers.
[132:06.29]Somebody's gonna have... Somebody's gonna be a bad guy.
[132:07.97]Let's watch.
[132:19.76]One of these three.
[132:23.83]Which one do you think is gonna be the criminal?
[132:25.77]I think it's gonna be the guy on the cell phone.
[132:29.73]It's definitely not the happy guy.
[132:33.19]And that's... That guy is like a... What did I tell you?
[132:39.37]Huh?
[132:40.27]Huh?

[134:03.28]He's fine.
[134:04.06]Or is he?

[134:38.28]What?
[134:41.08]The brawling couple.
[134:43.24]Couple of warning shots.
[134:49.91]Rhyme ain't easy.
[134:52.72]It's the same lady.
[134:59.13]I swear to God, guys, the game does not want me to shoot this person.
[135:02.81]No matter what.
[135:07.39]Every time.
[135:12.95]So, we're not gonna do it.
[135:16.60]Look at this car.
[135:17.70]Wowee.
[135:17.94]Wowee.
[135:24.59]This thing goes so fast, the game doesn't even know how to handle it.
[135:26.61]Let's get on the highway with this bad boy.
[135:29.19]And let's go at least 40.
[135:32.08]You know what I mean?
[135:33.60]Whoa!
[135:34.14]That's fast!
[135:35.34]At least 40.
[135:40.18]Going quick.
[135:42.72]Crime.
[135:43.45]We got a dispute over boyfriends.
[135:53.53]Locate the girlfriend Brawl.
[135:55.91]There's a dispute over a boy.
[135:56.91]26 meters.
[136:09.34]Why is this a crime?
[136:12.34]There's a multiple... There's a dispute over boyfriends.
[136:16.72]Who's the boyfriend?
[136:20.68]Okay, they all have knives.
[136:25.10]Won't they just work it out?
[136:26.34]I think it's over that guy right there.
[136:38.23]What are they holding?
[136:40.87]Alright.
[136:41.65]That's it, ladies.
[136:42.64]Break it up.
[136:45.56]Which one of you has drugs?
[136:47.40]Hey!
[136:47.68]Hey!
[136:49.48]Are you shitting me?
[136:50.96]You're not really doing this right now, are you?
[136:54.23]I just wanted to see if anybody had any drugs.
[137:02.79]This game fucking crashed.
[137:04.64]Come on!
[137:06.76]Why does this keep happening?
[137:07.86]No, I got it, I got it.
[137:09.86]I heard the windows noise.
[137:14.88]I think it actually did.
[137:22.59]Okay.
[137:23.86]So... I'm glad that we have at least two of you that are complying.
[137:29.28]So let's go ahead and let's just see if you have any drugs on you.
[137:34.02]What are you doing over here?
[137:36.72]Get out of here.
[137:39.49]I'm trying to grab you to check you for drugs.
[137:42.55]I don't want to arrest you.
[137:43.57]Okay, fine.
[137:44.41]I have to.
[137:55.39]Does this count as more than one crime?
[137:57.53]What does this count as?
[138:03.43]No, it didn't.
[138:04.25]It didn't.
[138:05.85]It didn't.
[138:06.65]That's fine.
[138:11.33]Hey!
[138:15.00]This car already is at low health somehow.
[138:22.21]I just looked over and saw, me and my girlfriend loves your stream so much.
[138:25.20]Thank you.
[138:25.50]I'm just thinking, wait, the couple that I just like broke up?
[138:28.52]On the street over there?
[138:29.32]I'm like, no.
[138:32.56]This is real life.
[138:33.48]Yes, ma'am.
[138:34.22]Why do I keep getting taxis?
[138:36.18]Alright, we got resisting arrest.
[139:01.90]Broke it up.
[139:05.99]Where's the other guy going?
[139:07.85]Over this way?
[139:14.41]That was... That is... That was brutal.
[139:16.73]There's no way you're making it out of that one.
[139:20.72]Hands up.
[139:21.42]Come on.
[139:22.84]Come on.
[139:25.78]Come on.
[139:27.70]I don't want to have to shoot anybody.
[139:33.85]Hey, useless cop.
[139:35.09]Hey, I got useless two cops over there.
[139:37.29]Good job, guys.
[139:39.09]You're doing fantastic work.
[139:53.02]Just think I just dropped her and now all of a sudden it's time to it's time to give up What do you got drugs do these count as crimes I
[140:23.92]Alright, spot the criminal.
[140:27.38]Alright, is it going to be Statler or Waldo?
[140:31.90]No!
[140:37.04]Why would this guy just pull out a gun?
[140:41.02]For what?
[140:43.44]Chase the mugger.
[140:44.46]Is he about to mug me?
[140:45.76]Oh, he's mugging me.
[140:50.42]And I have to chase this guy.
[140:54.03]Chase the bugger.
[141:10.40]Oh, great.
[141:19.32]The amount of times this game has just stopped allowing me to play.
[141:26.57]I need to... I hope that's saved.
[141:28.97]I'm an idiot.
[141:35.30]Hold on.
[141:35.92]I need to open it again.
[141:42.38]Please, I only have three more crimes to do.
[141:48.17]Sort out your stream.
[141:49.55]Alright, well, here's the thing.
[141:52.37]This game is from 2003.
[141:52.93]And...
[141:57.79]There is no windowed mode.
[141:59.93]I can't force it into a window.
[142:02.29]I've tried with DXWND.
[142:03.91]Doesn't work.
[142:05.83]So, because I have two monitors, and the chat is over here, and my OBS is over here, and everything is over here on the other monitor, I have to have this monitor turned on.
[142:17.44]So, it's just... It just ain't gonna work.
[142:22.50]This game is literally older than some probably people... Yeah, that's right.
[142:25.28]In the chat.
[142:25.74]Yeah.
[142:27.73]I tried WND, the windowed thing.
[142:32.26]It's alright.
[142:33.72]It hasn't been that much of a deterrent, so... Mission unsolved.
[142:52.33]I have to solve eight crimes again.
[142:53.65]Alright.
[142:59.75]If you just stand still long enough, it's just going to happen.
[143:05.13]I wish I could play this on console, but it was for PS2.
[143:09.25]I don't have a PS2.
[143:10.15]I don't even know where to get a PS2.
[143:12.17]Like eBay?
[143:15.57]And capturing a PS2?
[143:16.63]That would be a tiny resolution.
[143:19.43]There we go.
[143:33.12]Was that just lightning that I just saw on the horizon?
[143:37.16]What is going on over here?
[143:43.49]Alright, let's make this work.
[143:46.41]I just want to arrest.
[143:52.06]I don't want to do anything else.
[143:53.00]Just grab.
[143:53.64]Arrest.
[143:55.88]Just arrest.
[143:56.52]It's X. Please, just get it.
[144:01.95]Get out of the way, dude.
[144:03.61]On purpose, everyone's getting in my way.
[144:11.77]Alright.
[144:12.43]There it is.
[144:13.49]You're under arrest.
[144:19.05]What is going on with my game here?
[144:24.25]Why do this when I have guns?
[144:25.71]What's the point of that?
[144:26.58]Just end it.
[144:29.14]Just shoot her.
[144:34.07]You know, it ain't even like when the... Alright, so it's not even when the cursor's off the screen.
[144:41.00]It just kind of just happens for no reason.
[144:48.70]Hit him.
[144:57.58]Seven crimes.
[145:00.57]And we might actually call it a night after this.
[145:04.51]after this seven crimes.
[145:12.43]It always happens when you want to shoot.
[145:14.47]Something about when you aim with the mouse.
[145:15.92]I don't know what's going on.
[145:17.20]Alright.
[145:19.16]Crime.
[145:21.00]You.
[145:22.02]Just waiting for it.
[145:28.02]Should we play Sleeping Dogs?
[145:31.46]I've actually never played Sleeping Dogs.
[145:37.19]Fight has been... Corralled.
[145:42.47]New crime.
[145:44.00]Just hang out about... Just at least have like two or three pedestrians around and someone will be a criminal.
[145:48.18]That's how this works.
[145:50.36]Here he comes.
[145:55.60]Well, it's definitely going to be the guy that's about to run over three people.
[145:58.11]Alright, so he's a criminal.
[146:00.81]Right?
[146:00.99]Okay.
[146:07.37]No, he's not the criminal.
[146:10.99]Are you sure?
[146:12.21]I would call that guy a criminal.
[146:16.75]And a hit and run?
[146:19.87]Alright, locate Jay Delano's car.
[146:23.79]I should go play Neighbors from Val.
[146:33.21]I should play Sleeping Dogs.
[146:34.31]Alright, I never played it.
[146:41.00]I was kind of always under the impression that all those old GTA clones just weren't as good as GTA, so I never played them.
[146:48.07]It's like, why would I play Sleeping Dogs when I have GTA 4?
[146:51.67]Right?
[146:58.46]I'm more criminal than anybody else.
[146:59.88]Yeah, but I have a badge.
[147:08.94]Ugh.
[147:13.53]I should finish sleeping dogs on screen.
[147:18.62]We'll see what we get.
[147:19.82]We'll get there.
[147:30.25]Can I please, like, can somebody else just be a criminal instead?
[147:39.35]Casualty, that's what happens when you shoot without aiming.
[147:46.24]In a row.
[147:48.56]I'm not even paying attention.
[147:49.78]I'm just trying to get him.
[147:51.00]The curse is on him.
[147:52.08]It shouldn't be hitting anybody else.
[147:59.97]And he still is getting away.
[148:07.67]Hands up.
[148:10.53]You're under arrest.
[148:12.86]You have the right to remain silent.
[148:15.13]Anything you say or do doesn't even matter.
[148:17.57]Because I'm about to fucking squash your head with a car.
[148:21.89]Aw, that's too bad.
[148:23.93]Alright, criminal.
[148:25.93]Which one is the criminal?
[148:29.38]We've got three clones over here.
[148:30.74]Two clones and a lady on a cell phone.
[148:32.44]I'm going to go clone number one.
[148:34.32]Okay.
[148:48.46]Come on, that car's almost done.
[148:51.17]That car is so done.
[148:58.13]Well, let's go back here and wait for another one.
[149:03.35]Suspect escaped.
[149:07.15]I'm just gonna wait to be mugged by this lady.
[149:12.66]Yeah, I have a theory that if you hang out with the same pedestrian for long enough, they'll just be a criminal.
[149:18.06]So, let's search this lady.
[149:21.64]Okay.
[149:23.02]So, this lady's not a criminal.
[149:25.92]Just walking down the sidewalk, we're going to see how long this takes.
[149:33.50]Before she's a criminal.
[149:39.95]Oh.
[149:40.79]Okay.
[149:41.17]Well, just because she's not a criminal...
[149:45.76]doesn't mean that she isn't gonna be, eventually.
[150:04.03]Well, now she's running away.
[150:05.01]Don't worry.
[150:08.73]We'll catch up to her.
[150:14.33]Where's she at?
[150:17.55]No.
[150:17.93]It's alright.
[150:18.25]New lady.
[150:18.71]New lady.
[150:19.21]I need to have a reason to kill this lady.
[150:22.19]We're gonna get our reason right now.
[150:29.53]We got screwed up there because I had to follow... I was following that one lady.
[150:33.66]And we ran into a crime.
[150:38.10]This lady, if I follow her a long enough time, she will turn into a criminal.
[150:42.70]And we can finally get our revenge.
[150:47.88]I'm sorry.
[150:52.59]Come on.
[150:58.05]Do it.
[151:00.13]Pull out the gun.
[151:02.35]Give me... Give me a reason why I'm allowed to do this and not get in trouble.
[151:16.84]You guys don't think we're going to do this for like the next 20 minutes?
[151:19.06]We are.
[151:21.77]I found the thing I want to do.
[151:22.97]No.
[151:24.59]No.
[151:24.87]Where are they taking fire?
[151:26.01]No, I want to follow this lady.
[151:47.74]It's gonna happen eventually, you know it.
[151:55.52]That was bound to happen if we followed her for long enough.
[152:05.63]Watch the hair.
[152:08.79]Yeah, see, I'm doing crime prevention, not actively correcting crimes.
[152:14.91]That lady, this is like Minority Report.
[152:18.92]Can I please get out of here?
[152:20.80]Why am I stuck behind the giant hedge?
[152:25.12]Oh, thank you.
[152:27.22]Alright.
[152:28.59]Here we go.
[152:32.41]Same scenario.
[152:33.97]Same lady.
[152:35.21]This time I ain't gonna shoot first.
[152:36.75]I'm gonna ask questions first.
[153:09.16]Do something illegal, come on!
[153:23.72]Oh god, god damn it.
[153:28.73]All the way across the map.
[153:34.19]Stop the street fight, easy.
[153:40.67]Alright.
[153:42.19]Again.
[153:45.31]You.
[153:48.60]Do something illegal.
[153:52.46]Illegal.
[153:55.20]Do something illegal so I can fire upon you.
[153:57.14]I thought the lid hit a gun.
[154:07.85]Here we go.
[154:09.61]Here we go.
[154:10.61]Here we go.
[154:11.03]This is it.
[154:14.33]They're about to have a, they're about to have a, they're about to have a, quote, a girl fight, like they say on the radio.
[154:20.75]Who's gonna throw the first punch?
[154:22.55]Oh, shh.
[154:23.19]Come on.
[154:23.77]Really?
[154:27.48]The clones got annoyed that they saw another clone.
[154:30.70]And that is a crime.
[154:32.60]You've just committed a crime.
[154:35.60]But why is it not showing up?
[154:36.68]Assault on a police officer.
[154:37.76]What's going on here?
[154:41.61]And taunting an officer.
[154:43.19]That's four years in prison.
[154:45.37]Kicking an officer in the back is at least eight years in prison.
[154:48.87]Wildly cat-scratching the back of an officer's head.
[154:50.74]That's at least four years in prison.
[154:51.90]You're under fucking arrest.
[154:53.68]What is going on?
[154:54.24]Are her eyes bugging out of her head?
[155:11.28]I hit that lady so hard onto the ground, her eyes bugged out of red.
[155:18.28]Hold on, I need to see this.
[155:20.52]What in the name of God?
[155:31.23]It was an alien.
[155:34.89]Crime.
[155:37.00]It was a crime.
[155:38.62]I told you, she was an alien.
[155:42.30]She was doing something wrong.
[155:45.45]Killed by an alien.
[155:49.81]How many more fucking crimes?
[155:51.05]Three more crimes and then I'm gonna be done.
[155:57.57]Stop the thief, huh?
[155:59.47]Preliminary action.
[156:00.85]I was about to steal this car.
[156:05.56]My favorite car, the taxi.
[156:23.69]What's on the screen right now?
[156:25.59]Is that me dead?
[156:33.30]Shoot the gun at him!
[156:37.18]Suspect down.
[156:37.68]I need to get the chat back.
[156:42.38]I need to get the chat back.
[156:43.92]I can't see you guys.
[156:44.66]There we go.
[156:49.46]Two more crimes.
[157:01.79]Give me another crime.
[157:03.04]One more, two more.
[157:04.04]Whoa.
[157:12.52]Come on!
[157:17.02]This is a one-way street.
[157:21.82]Yeah, they're talking about me.
[157:24.58]Somebody called the police and said, hey, there's a fucking taxi that's driving on the wrong side of the road.
[157:29.67]You gotta get this guy.
[157:30.87]He's a danger to society.
[157:35.33]I'm talking about me driving.
[157:43.85]He done?
[157:45.39]He done.
[157:47.34]You done?
[157:47.96]Hands up.
[157:50.28]What is he holding?
[157:52.82]What's he holding?
[157:53.40]Is that a glass?
[157:55.15]Like a wine glass?
[157:59.19]Alright, let's see if we can do this.
[158:00.85]This is important.
[158:08.49]I really want him to hit somebody right in the face with this bottle.
[158:10.89]That's not me.
[158:12.49]That's pretty important, I'd say.
[158:15.93]On the scale of things that are important, that's number one importance.
[158:19.21]Hit this lady in the head with a bottle and not me.
[158:26.71]What's the... to get him to trigger the swing?
[158:31.44]I'm trying to find the path that needs to be done.
[158:34.58]He kind of needs to be just standing in front of him.
[158:38.90]This guy that's stuck is a good candidate right here.
[158:48.24]Pretty good candidate.
[158:52.18]I'm going to get him stuck behind these cars.
[158:54.40]And then eventually here, I'm going to get around this side, so here we go.
[159:01.75]Oh, you dick.
[159:02.61]You actually snuck through?
[159:03.77]No, god damn it.
[159:07.19]You blew it.
[159:11.66]Let's go.
[159:15.96]Why does every car have to sound like a jet engine?
[159:26.65]Last crime.
[159:28.17]Let me be done with it.
[159:37.10]Always a taxi?
[159:38.02]Yeah, because they're like big and bright and yellow.
[159:40.06]It's the easiest thing to see on the screen.
[159:43.50]Ex-military.
[159:43.82]Alright, investigating.
[159:44.54]That was a deep investigation.
[159:45.70]Final crime.
[159:46.44]Is he running back?
[159:47.06]I think he's getting back in the van.
[160:14.50]Crime completed.
[160:17.34]And I got a new gun.
[160:19.08]Alright.
[160:21.40]Con Girls is the next episode.
[160:23.22]Let's just watch the cutscene here, and then we're going to be on our way out.
[160:26.61]So there actually is two separate paths.
[160:30.21]That's cool.
[160:34.19]And if it were up to me, you wouldn't carry a badge.
[160:37.77]Man, who peed in your coffee?
[160:40.17]Look, smartass, you completely blow out surveillance of the spa.
[160:44.77]The bad guys are probably in Tijuana by now.
[160:47.13]Maybe not.
[160:47.89]Who made this game?
[160:48.57]In the last few days, there have been four bank heists around LA targeting Cyprus deposit boxes.
[160:53.62]Looks like they're after cash.
[160:55.56]You've done enough.
[160:57.84]Let me see your badge and gun.
[160:59.30]Put it on the table.
[161:00.08]Yeah.
[161:19.56]Ooh, that was a burn.
[161:21.98]That was a self-inflicted burn.
[161:24.28]Strip club detour.
[161:26.16]Okay, Kang, all these jobs were done by the same crew.
[161:29.22]Two women.
[161:30.24]Hey, nothing wrong with a little girl.
[161:32.26]Driving like a weirdo.
[161:33.54]How did you stop at an intersection?
[161:36.32]Forensics found only one print.
[161:38.14]It matched.
[161:38.86]You ready?
[161:39.86]A stripper named Gypsy.
[161:41.60]She works the pole at Body Fun Fest.
[161:44.50]Okay, well, I... This is too good.
[161:47.28]It gets better.
[161:48.87]I'm gonna bump this guy.
[161:53.76]I'm driving like a- What the fuck?
[162:03.32]Somebody just tried to kill me.
[162:10.61]Don't talk on the phone and drive.
[162:13.63]Somebody will try to shoot you.
[162:15.01]Ugh.
[162:19.99]Is this porn?
[162:20.61]Is this porno?
[162:21.71]Is this a porno thing?
[162:39.04]Yeah, stream's probably gonna come to a close here.
[162:42.00]Just about, you know, like, two minutes.
[162:45.30]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[162:46.82]Thanks for everyone sticking around.
[162:48.40]Appreciate it.
[162:56.01]He clearly was not trying to get out of the way.
[163:01.31]He sideswiped me like we were in a destruction derby.
[163:03.91]Oh, this game is too much.
[163:09.80]Alright, we got... Where am I going?
[163:15.41]How did I get stuck back here?
[163:19.11]Come on.
[163:23.15]Alright, well, can I skip it?
[163:28.41]Through this way.
[163:29.55]Can I drive on the blank texture?
[163:32.46]I guess.
[163:35.32]That's a nice little shortcut.
[163:40.95]That's a nice little shortcut, too.
[163:42.25]Now we're driving through the forest.
[163:48.66]I do feel like we're not supposed to be over here.
[163:52.10]But I'll take it.
[163:56.28]Look at that.
[164:00.81]We made it.
[164:05.16]Maybe we didn't.
[164:08.24]Alright, I'm gonna... Watch this.
[164:10.86]I got an idea.
[164:13.20]I'm gonna jump it.
[164:15.02]I'm gonna jump this with my body.
[164:21.41]Damn it.
[164:21.81]No, I'm not.
[164:25.31]No, I wanna jump.
[164:26.41]Why does space have to be take out your guns and shoot?
[164:30.57]I just wanna jump.
[164:36.54]Please, just get on the car.
[164:38.01]No!
[164:38.45]Alright, I can't arrest him.
[164:53.21]I'm not even on the same side of the street.
[164:55.98]Can I glitch over there?
[165:03.32]No.
[165:03.76]I can just make him dance.
[165:10.65]I can spin him around in circles.
[165:11.91]He just slapped that lady.
[165:14.67]Got it.
[165:23.86]Both suspects apprehended.
[165:29.18]I need this car, please.
[165:40.72]Street fight?
[165:43.54]Why do I care?
[165:44.20]Honestly, I'm just such a jaded police officer right now.
[165:49.09]Why do I care?
[165:49.77]I mean, I just need to see if this is possible.
[165:54.03]Every video game where you can actually... Every video game with a gas station, you just need to know if it's possible, right?
[166:16.87]What's going on?
[166:24.86]Oh, that was a mugging.
[166:25.82]Okay.
[166:29.91]No, it doesn't work.
[166:30.81]I could drive into it.
[166:37.79]Not possible.
[166:39.57]That's sad.
[166:45.67]Well, uh, vehicle repaired.
[166:49.03]Thanks!
[166:50.31]Appreciate that one.
[166:51.41]Alright, let's go to the mission.
[167:05.94]Straight up the river.
[167:12.64]Can't even... Can't even, like, murder myself.
[167:23.25]I had to.
[167:24.43]I had to do it.
[167:25.77]Don't get rid of that car, you piece of shit.
[167:27.55]So Vigilante 8 was a game, right?
[167:29.19]One of their games?
[167:43.16]Gas station.
[167:46.26]Another gas station.
[167:46.94]Another opportunity to try.
[167:51.92]No.
[167:52.07]That's too bad.
[167:53.13]I really wish it wasn't the case.
[167:57.13]But does that guy have drugs on him?
[167:58.95]There we go.
[167:59.37]We're almost there.
[168:00.01]I'm gonna go in in style.
[168:08.92]Stylized entrance.
[168:16.72]See?
[168:18.35]Resurrected.
[168:20.15]Rioting in progress.
[168:23.67]I'd rather go to like the script.
[168:25.15]Okay.
[168:27.41]What happened?
[168:30.81]I freaked out and I pressed a button and now we're like here.
[168:39.65]No, they're closed.
[168:40.39]They have clothes on.
[168:41.09]They're closed.
[168:41.73]It's alright everybody.
[168:42.57]Nobody freak out.
[168:51.63]Are these women clothed?
[168:53.93]Alright, that woman is clothed.
[168:57.33]She has a top on.
[168:59.65]What about you over here?
[169:00.35]Yeah, you've got clothes on.
[169:04.14]There's another girl over here.
[169:05.22]Are you also wearing clothes?
[169:09.56]Yep, okay.
[169:12.96]Everybody has clothes on.
[169:13.85]Except, I don't know if that one does.
[169:15.21]I don't think that one has clothes on.
[169:16.71]I don't think that one has clothes on.
[169:23.48]I think one of them is naked.
[169:26.24]I'm pretty sure one of them is not.
[169:27.88]One of them is naked.
[169:29.54]But you're not gonna... ugh.
[169:37.18]I'm gonna start fighting this naked lady over here.
[169:39.56]Grab.
[169:47.60]You're done.
[169:51.91]I just got bit in the face.
[169:52.97]Come on, really?
[169:53.61]You're almost dead.
[169:56.15]A few more hits.
[170:10.42]Only four more people I have to beat.
[170:12.50]Give me that weapon and let me just spam it, please.
[170:14.49]Let me grab it out of her hand.
[170:17.45]Drop the weapon and give it to me.
[170:19.49]I want to make this much easier on myself.
[170:26.60]There it is.
[170:27.86]Time to just start swinging wildly.
[170:34.70]Does so much more damage than anything else.
[170:36.10]Who cares?
[170:39.77]Again.
[170:39.99]Oh god, are you sure?
[170:41.91]Are you sure that lady has clothes on?
[170:43.59]Are you sure?
[170:47.31]She's making all these, like, sexual noises.
[170:59.71]Sick.
[171:00.27]Wild.
[171:10.39]Okay.
[171:10.61]Let's get a fresh spatula.
[171:13.37]Alright, no.
[171:15.37]Give me the fresh spatula.
[171:18.43]Got it.
[171:21.15]What's going on with this lady's feet?
[171:27.83]What's going on there?
[171:32.16]Something weird.
[171:34.54]Somebody stiffed on her feet.
[171:36.65]Somebody squished her feet like they made it in Play-Doh.
[171:43.98]Somebody rolled the ends of her toes like she's a fucking cigarette or like a blunt.
[172:02.32]Who's left?
[172:03.76]One more.
[172:08.08]Wherever you are, you're smashing shit.
[172:09.54]I don't know where you are.
[172:10.68]Let's hit the click spam.
[172:17.44]Alright, we're good.
[172:21.64]There's like a sleaze bag that runs the place.
[172:29.19]Oh, so this is the Adam Sandler character.
[172:31.03]Really, like, extremely quick.
[172:37.35]Just fricking Jared Leto.
[172:41.58]Is this like his latest movie?
[172:47.92]He's blocking everything.
[172:54.65]I'm just gonna Mortal Kombat style this.
[172:58.81]He's blocking everything.
[173:00.60]Stop blocking.
[173:02.28]Even if you blocked, it's a fucking spatula.
[173:04.58]I just threw that.
[173:16.98]I threw it at his face.
[173:18.62]That's all it takes.
[173:20.28]Grabs.
[173:20.60]What am I talking about?
[173:21.36]Grabs.
[173:21.76]You gotta go for grabs, man.
[173:26.62]No, he's gonna win.
[173:29.37]Just kick the shit out of him, please.
[173:30.75]End it with a grab.
[173:32.97]Can we be done here?
[173:34.85]You have a lot of friends.
[173:54.80]Listen, officer, I swear I was just a driver for Lola G's.
[173:59.04]Lola G's?
[173:59.96]The babe from the con girl's TV show?
[174:02.08]No way.
[174:02.78]Yeah.
[174:03.26]Big eye shadow.
[174:03.76]After her Hollywood gig crashed, she decided to steal for real.
[174:07.66]Life imitating art, huh?
[174:09.18]So, when's the next hit?
[174:10.98]I was gonna meet Lola at the spot later tonight.
[174:14.40]Well, Lola's reality show is about to get canceled.
[174:18.54]Oh, no.
[174:19.30]Dead lady on the ground back there.
[174:28.94]I jumped a gun there at the end.
[174:31.96]Pump you full of lead.
[174:32.90]Is he talking about his hand?
[174:36.98]The way he's holding it seems like that's not a fist.
[174:39.42]That it's actually a weapon.
[174:49.47]I just opened up my recycling bin somehow.
[174:54.59]Makes perfect sense.
[175:05.65]Give me a gun.
[175:08.66]Suspect defeated.
[175:09.74]Victim killed.
[175:11.26]What?
[175:15.82]That guy was a suspect and a victim.
[175:20.32]So when I came out of the bar, the strip club, I hit that guy with the door and punched him.
[175:25.64]And he became a victim.
[175:28.28]And then he decided that he was going to just pull a gun out and shoot somebody.
[175:33.20]That also made him a criminal.
[175:37.64]Stop the carjacker.
[175:48.86]I shot him in the... Okay.
[176:00.24]Drive to Lola meeting.
[176:01.46]Solves street crimes.
[176:02.44]Optional.
[176:02.88]I think we're going to call it a day for now.
[176:04.64]Call it a night.
[176:10.74]I'm actually enjoying this game a lot.
[176:12.58]It's actually pretty fun.
[176:20.33]Were defeaters used for murder?
[176:25.01]Did somebody say yard work?
[176:34.08]Now I'm yawning.
[176:35.60]I'm sorry I'm making everybody yawn here.
[176:39.68]Yeah, let's call it a night for now.
[176:43.52]Let's go to the bits.
[176:45.21]Let's read some bits.
[176:47.35]I didn't really do any of them tonight, so... Let's, um... Let's go through them, what do you say?
[176:55.39]So, uh, thank you to, first of all, everybody for watching.
[177:00.19]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[177:01.83]If there's no internet problems, which I hope there really isn't.
[177:06.19]We didn't get any issues tonight at all.
[177:07.99]I'm hoping we get done with that shit and it's past us.
[177:12.37]But, par anything goes horribly wrong with that.
[177:18.99]Hi, Jeremy.
[177:20.85]Nice to see you again.
[177:23.77]Maybe we'll play some more of this.
[177:25.61]Either that or there's another game or two I'd like to
[177:29.10]There's obviously Metro Last Light as well.
[177:31.78]To, like, go back to and actually start to play it and... Put time into it.
[177:37.66]But thanks for watching, everybody.
[177:40.49]And let's get to the bits.
[177:42.83]Thank you, Comcast Customer Care, for the $5.
[177:45.07]We're terribly sorry to hear about your internet troubles.
[177:46.85]Here at Comcast, we strive to bring you the highest standard in internet services.
[177:50.25]Please accept this $5 voucher to Burger King as compensation for your troubles.
[177:53.67]Thank you so much.
[177:55.66]That means a lot to me, Comcast Customer Cares.
[178:01.68]It's not like I pay more than $125 a month for this to work.
[178:07.71]Thanks for the $5 Burger King fries.
[178:11.93]Also, thank you to Coco Russo for the $5.
[178:13.93]Jeremy, I can't believe you hate my favorite anime because my favorite character says my favorite catchphrase.
[178:17.43]You insult my waifu, I end your life.
[178:22.45]What anime are we talking about here?
[178:26.71]Thank you Ass or Asser.
[178:29.40]For the one dollar.
[178:29.96]Just want to thank you for all the laughs over the years.
[178:31.36]I remember watching your Kill the Meme stream and laughing so hard that I broke both of my femur bones.
[178:36.94]The doctor says that I may walk again in three to four months.
[178:39.57]Looking forward to more fun streams and please don't hurt me anymore.
[178:43.77]Well, I'm sorry that you've been injured by watching one of the streams.
[178:49.45]But as long as you had a good time and nobody got hurt, then who cares?
[178:55.16]Everything's fine, right?
[178:56.14]Thank you so much.
[178:59.03]Kyle, 99, thanks for the one dollar, this game is not okay.
[179:01.77]I think this is back, this is back, people are referring to... Um, what is it called?
[179:09.31]Have the meme funeral already.
[179:12.25]I didn't even know, I didn't think I was even gonna be able to stream today.
[179:16.37]Meme funeral's gonna happen.
[179:18.39]This might, this might take like a few weeks, you know what I mean?
[179:21.71]I gotta get the whole family down here.
[179:24.41]You know how many people are gonna show up for the jermaEarth funeral?
[179:29.29]Earth.
[179:30.87]There's 7 billion people on Earth.
[179:33.13]It's a lot of prepping and a lot of antipasta salads I'm going to have to prepare.
[179:37.89]It's a lot of people to take care of for a day.
[179:44.44]Thank you, though.
[179:44.90]Thank you, Kyle.
[179:45.38]Thank you.
[179:45.72]Yeah, $3.45 for the $1.
[179:48.46]Compax Framer threatens to destroy Comcast headquarters.
[179:51.44]If I drop one frame.
[179:52.93]I did not.
[179:54.39]I did not do that.
[179:57.37]Thank you for the $1, but we seem to be working fine now, so that's good.
[180:02.91]Tentacle Wizard, thanks for the $10.
[180:04.45]You might be playing streamers from hell, but you, my friend, are a godsend.
[180:09.07]Thanks for the good content for all these years.
[180:10.47]Enjoy these bits.
[180:11.13]Thank you, Tentacle Wizard.
[180:13.25]Appreciate that.
[180:15.53]Much love to you.
[180:17.69]Very kind words.

[180:20.73]Love the streams.
[180:21.79]Thanks for all the laughs.
[180:23.26]Thanks for all the...
[180:27.46]time that you have given me.
[180:30.24]Much love to you, Hunty.
[180:31.20]Thank you for the almost $30 here.
[180:34.54]Travelboy22, thanks for the $1.
[180:36.06]Here's a buck for being the best thing to happen to me today.
[180:38.30]Mwah.
[180:38.72]That was a kiss.
[180:39.38]I got a kiss right there.
[180:41.39]I just got a kissy.
[180:42.57]Un-fucking-believable.
[180:43.51]I am so happy about that.
[180:45.77]Didn't hurt myself this time when I put my hand on.
[180:47.99]If you're curious.
[180:49.07]I figured out a way to do that when I wouldn't injure my hand.
[180:52.35]Thank you, Travelboy.
[180:54.36]Moo means moo.
[180:54.88]Thanks for the $1.
[180:55.70]The new Beholder update looks a lot like a downgrade.
[180:59.26]Also good to have you back.
[181:00.05]Hopefully the internet stops being garbage.
[181:01.41]Me too.
[181:03.29]Beholder.
[181:06.63]Have I ever played Beholder?
[181:07.57]I don't think I've ever played Beholder.
[181:10.81]Oh, that was a joke on the Neighbors from Hell portion.
[181:15.25]Ah, I see.
[181:15.85]Oh, I'm dumb.
[181:18.15]Tgetots.
[181:19.03]Tgetots.
[181:19.99]Tgetots.
[181:21.58]Tea Tots.
[181:22.74]Tater Tots.
[181:23.37]Thanks for the $1.
[181:26.79]Not like this.
[181:28.73]Clever Cactus.
[181:29.29]Thanks for the $1.
[181:31.79]Jacob.
[181:32.23]Thanks for the $1.
[181:33.01]Stop abusing this poor beer.
[181:36.17]Again, it just really made me feel bad.
[181:39.03]O3O.
[181:39.65]Okay, so now we've got... We had OWO.
[181:43.41]And now you tell me we've got C3PO now.
[181:47.13]What is C3PO?
[181:47.65]What is this one?
[181:51.29]Is this like, hey, I'm like putting my ass in your face?
[181:53.33]Is that what this is?
[181:54.63]That's what the last one was.
[181:57.93]O-W-O, it's not an owl.
[181:59.27]It's like, hey, look, it's somebody's penis.
[182:01.63]So C-3PO is, look, I'm putting my ass in your face, right?
[182:05.83]That has to be the same.
[182:06.97]You have to make conclusions here.
[182:10.61]Whatever.
[182:13.09]Thank you to...
[182:15.29]A glyph bin for the $5.
[182:16.39]Hey, Jerma, I have to develop a PC game from scratch over the next 10 weeks, but I don't know what to make.
[182:22.28]Got any fun ideas rattling around in the skull of yours?
[182:25.22]Make Space Invaders.
[182:27.42]Just make Space Invaders, but instead of aliens coming down, it's cheese.
[182:35.03]And instead of the spaceship, you're a mouse?
[182:40.45]I always, like, saw cheese.
[182:41.73]No, no, no, sorry, sorry, I got that wrong.
[182:44.27]So, half of these space invaders, with a bunch of mice, are the invaders.
[182:50.42]And those shields, those weird shields that are in front of your ship, make those cheese.
[182:56.54]So the rats, the mice are coming down for the cheese.
[182:59.28]And you are, you know, Mr. Exterminator Man with your, you know, going back and forth with the green goo that shoots out and trying to get rid of all those mice that don't get to the cheese.
[183:08.27]Because every time I've played Space Invaders, shooting that shield in front of you just made it look like cheese, like Swiss cheese.
[183:15.55]And I always, like, thought it was so funny when I was, like, four.
[183:18.51]But there you go.
[183:19.57]Make that game and then make a quadrillion dollars.
[183:22.61]And I want 50 bucks.
[183:24.55]When you make a quadrillion.
[183:26.26]For the idea.
[183:27.84]But thanks a lot, dude.
[183:28.78]Good luck to you.
[183:32.46]Wow, it's his birthday.
[183:33.40]I wonder if anyone else has birthdays.
[183:35.02]Happy birthday, everyone.
[183:35.92]I don't know anybody else with a birthday.
[183:41.66]I mean, somebody's supposed to be at like a surprise birthday party.
[183:44.84]Somebody was supposed to get a surprise birthday party like nine days ago and wasn't patient enough.
[183:50.51]You know, you weren't patient enough that it passed you by.
[183:53.96]Somebody was supposed to get a surprise birthday party nine days ago, and it didn't happen, so, like, you... Obviously... I mean, like, come on.
[184:01.00]Trying to work with me here, you know?
[184:05.50]QWQ now, I see.
[184:06.88]Okay, but that's, like, two... That's, like, two guys, like, with their dicks hanging out, because, like, the Q is, like, the... I get it.
[184:12.65]Yeah, that's funny.
[184:14.59]And the W is, like, somebody, like, holding them both up.
[184:19.11]Like an old-school strength contest.
[184:22.67]Fuck, real funny.
[184:23.69]QWQ.
[184:24.95]Nice.
[184:30.15]Thank you to Gabe Degrossi.
[184:35.94]He's making it worse.
[184:39.76]I'm just being- I'm, like, doing it ironically, because, like, that's the- I'm just being so ironic right now.
[184:46.42]God, I fucking hate when people say that.
[184:49.60]Nobody says that.
[184:51.59]I just said that people say that, and I've never heard anyone say that.
[184:55.47]I've never heard a person say that before.
[184:58.81]But I thank you, Gabe DeGrossi, for the $12.
[185:00.35]Hey, Jerma, I love your streams and looking forward to your future projects.
[185:04.57]I hope you have a great new year with so many more great times.
[185:06.99]Well, thank you, Gabe DeGrossi.
[185:10.56]Good luck in the next Rumble.
[185:16.36]Have a good knock on wood, Gabe.
[185:22.47]Thank you dearly, beloved, for the $1.
[185:24.05]Gerber broke into my house, clogged my toilet, drank all my Pepsi, and called me a bitch.
[185:29.68]You don't call people a bitch in that game.
[185:31.88]I mean, you do poison their sodas and force them to have throw-up diarrhea.
[185:37.06]But come on, a bitch?
[185:39.12]Nah, that don't happen.
[185:41.28]You just poison them.
[185:43.62]Leather jacket, thanks for the $1.
[185:45.00]Switch his internet connection with yours, he'll be pissed.
[185:50.33]I like that one.
[185:52.16]Let me switch our internets.
[185:56.38]Hasnain, thanks for the $1.
[185:57.76]Djack, thanks for the $1.
[186:00.10]This guy doesn't seem that bad of a neighbor.
[186:02.86]If this guy hates him so much, why did he follow him on holiday and not enjoy the week alone?
[186:06.93]Immersion ruined.
[186:09.15]I don't think the developers were thinking that far ahead.
[186:12.69]But maybe they were.
[186:14.69]Thank you, though, Djack.
[186:15.79]Appreciate the $1.
[186:16.49]Also, Darkstar7000, thanks for the $1.
[186:20.37]Just got back from a really late chemistry class.
[186:22.39]I'm so glad you're streaming.
[186:23.33]Makes me happy to see you criticize popular games.
[186:25.48]I don't know.
[186:28.94]I'm just like a weirdo.
[186:30.86]I think I've come to terms with the fact that I just don't like anything.
[186:33.96]Does anybody else like that?
[186:38.18]Like, for instance, like the latest... Like, every day... I'll use Star Wars as an example here.
[186:44.78]I sat there during the whole entire movie.
[186:47.76]With just a scowl on my face.
[186:50.70]And what's the... Two hours and 48 minutes went by.
[186:54.70]And it was just like... I didn't like that.
[186:59.61]Like, playing a video game... I don't like this game.
[187:03.57]I don't like anything.
[187:04.37]Like, I don't... Like, I just don't like anything anymore.
[187:08.35]Well, that's not true.
[187:09.65]No.
[187:12.11]Jade.
[187:12.49]I'm just so jaded.
[187:17.36]I think it is just overstimulation and complete jadedness.
[187:23.80]Everything is at our fingertips, you know what I mean?
[187:26.28]Like, we got more Star Wars movies.
[187:28.40]Do you ever think this was gonna happen?
[187:31.04]Think about jaded and just absolutely spoiled and desensitized we've been to.
[187:35.88]Like, even just something like Star Wars.
[187:39.52]There's gonna be 12 movies canon in Star Wars.
[187:45.20]George Lucas got drunk in his college dorm room and wrote like fucking four pages of A New Hope.
[187:52.71]You ever think that guy ever really thought?
[187:55.01]Sure, in interviews he's like, Well, yes, I truly believed that we were going to have two different universes.
[188:00.92]There was going to be a Clone Wars, and then there was also going to be a few other movies that were made after the fact.
[188:08.84]No, this guy was like shit-faced in his dorm room and wrote about funny robots and shit.
[188:12.82]We've got 12 Star Wars movies.
[188:16.17]12 of them.
[188:19.17]Do you know how jaded we've become?
[188:26.53]Seriously.
[188:29.78]Anyways, what was the question?
[188:31.70]Oh, no, it wasn't a question.
[188:32.82]It was a comment.
[188:33.34]But thank you, Darkstar.
[188:35.06]I think I just... I'm just like a weirdo now.
[188:39.45]I feel like I've always been like this, but I refused to admit it, that I was, like, a pessimist about, like, media.
[188:47.94]But, thank you, and, uh, thank you nonetheless.
[188:51.10]Uh, Ancy, thanks for the $2.
[188:52.72]Jeremiah, have you heard about the Dark Souls remastering yet?
[188:55.40]Will you beat it on stream?
[188:57.68]It depends on if it's actually a remaster, or if it is, hey, we made it 1920 by 1080 resolution on the Switch, and this funny Switch controls, and, like, Mario, like, is on the loading screen.
[189:07.82]Like, no.
[189:08.30]If that's the case, no.
[189:09.94]Are they actually, like, redoing the game?
[189:12.38]Is it gonna be better controls?
[189:14.53]Are they gonna do some quality of life improvements?
[189:16.47]Like, what are they changing?
[189:18.63]Is it just a port?
[189:27.06]Really, you beat it on stream, in quotes.
[189:30.00]They're not fixing shit.
[189:32.51]It's just coming out again.
[189:34.13]Didn't they already do that?
[189:36.23]I thought Dark Souls... The PC release for Dark Souls, Prepare to Die Edition...
[189:42.22]Wasn't that them kind of fixing all the bullshit that everybody hated on the PC version?
[189:47.72]And they relaunched the game with all the DLC or something like that, right?
[189:50.66]Wait, they're doing that again?
[189:52.08]Don't tell me Dark Souls 1 is going to be like the new Chrono Trigger or the new Skyrim.
[189:55.63]Where it just comes out like three fucking times.
[189:58.89]It's a new engine.
[189:59.93]So they actually are doing it.
[190:05.63]We should wait for more information before we come to a conclusion.
[190:07.95]Alright, I'm with you there.
[190:09.71]I'm with you on that one.
[190:11.57]That sounds really interesting to me, though, because, I mean, I love the series.
[190:15.89]And I know it's hard to say that when you don't have to play through the most important one that everybody loves so much.
[190:22.97]But I do love the series.
[190:26.19]I love the idea.
[190:27.09]I just love Dark Souls and Bloodborne.
[190:29.73]They're just fun games.
[190:31.15]They're very difficult and, damn, were those hard.
[190:36.97]Did good, though.
[190:38.92]Especially when I beat Champion Gundyr first try.
[190:43.02]And it took other people potentially, like, days to beat him.
[190:47.14]I mean, I just don't want to toot my own horn.
[190:49.32]Don't want to toot my own tuba on this one.
[190:51.53]But, I mean, you guys watched it happen.
[190:55.97]You just said you don't like anything.
[190:57.79]Yeah, that's not true, though.
[191:02.25]Uh... Not again.
[191:06.55]Ay-yi-yi.
[191:08.29]But, thanks for the two bucks, Ansi.
[191:10.27]Appreciate it.
[191:11.35]Uh, Desoid Cloud is a keyboard mash.
[191:14.35]Thanks for the 15 bucks, dude.
[191:17.09]Uh... What is this?
[191:22.82]Praise Joko.
[191:25.90]The Inevitable.
[191:28.72]Joko is the monarch.
[191:31.28]What is all this?
[191:33.66]I don't know who that is, but thank you for the $15.
[191:36.56]I appreciate it.
[191:40.44]Obviously we had Purple coming in there earlier with the $150 bit donation.
[191:44.83]And the most of the $150 donation was for me to turn on the Neighbors music.
[191:49.99]That's
[192:01.08]I think, honest to God, Purple, I'm going to give you a little bit of an assessment here.
[192:05.58]That $150 is probably more money than games purchased on Steam for Neighbors from Hell.
[192:15.66]I would like to potentially make that bet.
[192:18.62]I don't know what I would put on the table there, but friendly bet-wise, I don't think more than 12 copies of this game have ever been purchased from Steam.
[192:27.60]I don't know if you can find the data.
[192:29.40]If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
[192:30.24]But, you know, it's all good.
[192:33.61]Thank you so much, dude, for the $150.
[192:36.87]Lots and lots of money.
[192:40.51]Always appreciated.
[192:42.45]But damn, that's a fucking lot.
[192:44.75]Thank you so much, dude.
[192:47.73]Bet the $150.
[192:50.98]Wait, Neighbors from Hell is on Steam.
[192:52.44]Yes, it is.
[192:54.20]I didn't even know this until I got a boxed copy.
[192:56.18]I have a boxed copy.
[192:59.91]sitting right there neighbors from hell it's on steam Jerm of the shill what are you talking about thanks to dark star again for the one dollar holy should have needed a good laugh that burp I need to when the stream turns off dude I'm gonna watch that like 10 times that's one of the funniest things ever that was the most unexpected stupid thing I've ever heard
[193:25.23]That just threw me just over the edge.
[193:28.42]Thanks a lot, though.
[193:29.40]Nuclear Chamber, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[193:31.12]Read bits, you tiny man.

[193:38.08]Appreciate it.

[193:55.67]Ames, and they say never change.
[193:59.85]That was kind of rude.
[194:00.69]It was kind of rude.
[194:03.79]It was very rude.
[194:06.01]It was very rude.
[194:09.48]But, you know, we're going to let that slide.

[194:30.68]Police will be there soon.
[194:34.38]Killing time.
[194:35.90]We've been killing time together, you and I. When I stream, I've been killing time.
[194:41.99]Stop talking about that, because...
[194:47.03]Just forget it.
[194:50.03]You'll see soon enough.

[195:22.79]Can Germachamp be a new emote?
[195:25.41]No, everybody has one of those.
[195:26.75]Like, you know, like, not to like talk shit about Twitch and streaming and everything, but if you were to do a little bit of data collection and find out how many streamers that have a subscription, how many of them have their own PogChamp emote,
[195:45.05]Everybody has their own, like, caricature doing a pogchamp.
[195:48.48]I ain't doing that, okay?
[195:51.46]It's like everybody has a picture of their fucking dog.
[195:53.82]Everybody has their own pogchamp.
[195:59.43]I don't want... And everybody has their own, like, Kappa.
[196:02.49]Everybody has their own, like... Everybody takes, like, the one... No, not gonna happen.
[196:13.93]I did a dog video.
[196:15.33]I did a dog video like four and a half years ago.
[196:20.21]You guys make it sound like I made Otto's Big Adventure 2 like last night.
[196:25.74]That video was made in like 2011.
[196:27.84]I was like 16.
[196:29.88]But thank you for the bits, Ratuna.
[196:35.92]Appreciate it.
[196:44.05]You already have, I have like a what face.
[196:46.31]And I already got it covered.
[196:47.41]See, I already have like a my version of like, look, it's my face, like making a face, right?
[196:55.36]But that's, that emote though is taken from a video that I made, right?
[197:00.42]I didn't just like turn my face into a pogchamp.
[197:05.09]Or like a LUL.
[197:06.57]Like, that's a screen cap from a video from, like, my channel.
[197:11.61]I didn't, like... Nobody, like, made that face for me.
[197:15.52]I didn't, like, turn my webcam on and, like, make, like, a fucking what face.
[197:18.44]I'm just gonna do an LUL.
[197:29.03]You guys are gonna be, like, so pissed off.
[197:32.46]No, I'm gonna combine them all.
[197:33.72]I'm gonna combine them all.
[197:35.48]Nobody's done that yet.
[197:36.70]Yeah, I'm doing that.
[197:38.64]One of my next emotes is gonna be, like, an LUL face pogchamp Kappa dog.
[197:45.61]But it's gonna be, like, a caricature, like, a cute little, like, cute little character that's drawn out.
[197:52.79]It's not, like, my actual face.
[197:54.21]It's gonna be everything combined.
[198:00.27]And you know it's gonna be called Jerma Streamer.
[198:02.36]That's what it's gonna be called.
[198:10.78]Yeah, just combine them all.
[198:12.04]Just make like a gigantic mess.
[198:14.87]It's gonna be the ultimate like streamer emote.
[198:17.61]You can use it in any circumstance.
[198:19.79]You can do it to show sarcasm.
[198:21.71]You can do it to laugh, show emotion, show hatred.
[198:24.25]Like it's gonna be all of them.
[198:29.56]Thanks though.
[198:31.23]Also, thank you to... There we go.

[198:54.41]I rest my case.
[198:56.40]I rest my case.
[198:58.52]But thank you for the $5, dude.
[198:59.62]And $10 right after that.
[199:01.48]Thanks for the $15 total here.
[199:03.58]Please place some acid base in the background.
[199:11.15]Yes, he did.
[199:14.27]Nope.
[199:16.75]Thank you so much, though, Ampco, for the $15, dude.

[199:26.60]Thank you, Nick, for the $1 so Jerma now that it is being remastered.
[199:29.78]Think you're going to give Dark Souls a chance?
[199:32.28]We touched upon that already, but the answer is, again, yes, if it's substantially changed.
[199:39.15]The things I didn't like about Dark Souls 1, if they're addressed for me, personally, then yeah, I would definitely play it.
[199:47.57]For sure, on stream.
[199:50.17]Thank you to TechnoToast for the 50 cents.
[199:52.23]I love listening to the loud B's of LA.

[200:17.76]Hello, Nat.
[200:19.18]Is that short for Natalie?
[200:21.28]Hi, Natalie.

[200:38.11]Hey, Jerva!
[200:39.49]Did you know that pee is stored in the balls?
[200:47.22]I actually didn't know that.
[200:49.46]I thought pee was stored in your, um... In, like, your gallbladder, I think.
[200:54.24]Because that's why it's the bladder.
[200:55.47]Because the bladder, it's your gallbladder... Is where it's stored.
[201:00.93]Thank you, though.
[201:01.65]Uh, Pin, thanks for the $1.
[201:02.99]They just say W. I think it's an anime face.
[201:07.07]Thank you, Pin, for the $1.

[201:25.08]Mayuri.
[201:27.16]Mayuri from Steins Gate.
[201:28.80]Okay.
[201:30.22]That was painful for me to do that.
[201:32.30]Steins Gate... That show sucks.
[201:37.45]I'm sorry.
[201:39.45]I told you, I don't like anything.
[201:42.27]I like very specific things and everything else sucks.
[201:50.89]I'm just kidding.
[201:51.67]Look, if you like it, it's great.
[201:56.98]I got in a big argument with Etalyx about Steins Gate and how like I didn't like it and he was like, he was very angry with me.
[202:04.38]We had like an hour and a half long like friend argument.
[202:08.88]Like nearly friend ending argument about Steins Gate.
[202:15.08]How far did I get?
[202:16.26]I watched the whole thing.
[202:19.93]I completed every episode.
[202:23.51]And I thought it was a cool show.
[202:27.47]Except for the end.
[202:31.18]Without spoilers.
[202:33.66]Look, I told you.
[202:34.22]I sat through all of the Star Wars movies.
[202:36.36]The last one.
[202:36.84]And I was like, I don't like anything.
[202:38.24]So don't be surprised if I don't like Steins Gate.
[202:47.36]But anyways, guys.
[202:50.08]I don't not like anything.
[202:51.22]I just don't enjoy everything.
[203:00.74]Good night, guys.
[203:01.80]I will see you all tomorrow.
[203:03.98]Have a good sleep.
[203:06.48]Continue the internet prayers.
[203:07.75]Hopefully it sticks.
[203:08.59]Hopefully it stays stable.
[203:12.47]Because it was completely stable tonight.
[203:15.23]So good night.
[203:16.57]Good luck.
[203:18.03]Have a good one.
[203:18.57]Take care.
