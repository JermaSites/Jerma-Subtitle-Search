[00:03.41]Hi.
[00:06.53]Did you see the title?
[00:09.09]Yeah.
[00:10.69]I got my save.
[00:14.20]I actually just had to go into the PlayStation account settings.
[00:19.44]Downloaded the cloud save because I just have my PlayStation Gym membership.
[00:27.00]right you just forget that it exists it just takes out what ten dollars a month forever even if you don't go and work out it still happens uh so I was able to have my save so give me a second while people trickle in see you in a sec
[01:22.66]I just saw somebody say, maybe he won't play Minecraft this time.
[01:27.90]Well, I mean, come on.
[01:30.52]I was also drinking heavily that night.
[01:35.98]So, what?
[01:38.33]I drunkenly played Minecraft?
[01:46.73]That didn't, that, I didn't, whatever.
[01:52.36]The last mission that I was on here, I have a distinct memory of walking around in a circle not knowing how to go down to the crash.
[02:01.68]I finally figured it out, and now we're moving on to the next part.
[02:04.89]I'll give you a quick rundown of the story so far.
[02:09.05]It hasn't gotten over.
[02:14.05]You ruined Kim's Minecraft world.
[02:16.54]No, that's in the cloud, man.
[02:18.96]We're good.
[02:24.93]Alright, I'm going to move my mic a little bit because I'm trying to increase the volume here.
[02:29.71]Hold on.
[02:30.09]Give me a moment.
[02:51.74]Trying to find like the right spot where this is not obstructing any view, but it's also good quality.
[03:00.30]Okay, so let's go like this and we go like this and there it is.
[03:05.73]Make sure it's synced.
[03:06.83]I know that's been a problem recently.
[03:15.39]Bring back the headset, Mike.
[03:16.97]No.
[03:18.61]Why on Earth would I do that?
[03:21.89]Alright.
[03:22.09]So here's, here's what you guys have to tell me.
[03:24.93]So are you ready?
[03:26.50]I'm going to go like this up and down and you should be hearing a click right when it switches and highlights a different option.
[03:33.36]Okay.
[03:42.67]Good.
[03:43.55]Alright.
[03:43.75]Now I'm going to match my voice with it.
[03:44.89]Ready?
[03:45.05]1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[03:46.57]We good?
[03:58.41]Voice is a smidge delayed.
[04:00.75]Okay.
[04:01.95]I'll try it one more time.
[04:05.63]1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[04:14.10]Big delay.
[04:14.90]Big.
[04:17.64]So my voice comes after is what you're saying.
[04:22.34]Because this is an issue I've had recently.
[04:26.95]So the voice...
[04:28.91]How about this one?
[04:34.66]Ready?
[04:34.92]1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[04:36.82]1, 2, 3, 4.
[04:37.28]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[04:37.40]1, 2, 3, 4.
[04:37.56]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[04:37.74]Alright, it's good.
[04:55.51]Alright, how about now?
[04:57.21]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2.

[05:03.51]Are we okay?
[05:06.87]How about one more time?
[05:09.07]Can you guys tell?
[05:09.57]We're good, right?
[05:10.09]Alright, let's go!
[05:10.59]Welcome back to L.A.
[05:11.33]New Or- Oh, never mind, we're gonna cut this.
[05:29.47]So, oh, I forgot to tell you, I gotta tell you the story so far.
[05:32.23]Wait a minute.
[05:35.67]I can't pause it, can I?
[05:37.87]Okay.
[05:38.61]So, this case, there was a crash.
[05:42.02]Somebody went sailing off the edge.
[05:44.74]Might have been intentional.
[05:45.72]Somebody weighed down the pedal.
[05:47.84]There was an actress involved.
[05:49.88]The actress is in the car, and she might know more than she thinks.
[05:53.25]Bang!
[05:53.57]They fly off.
[05:54.34]I'm going to visit the other lady that was in the car to see if I can get more information because, man, this might have been a fucking murder attempt.
[06:00.34]You know what I'm saying?
[06:10.23]Hello.
[06:10.87]Detective Phelps.
[06:12.01]Here to interview a Jessica Hamilton.
[06:15.05]Jessica Hamilton.
[06:17.19]Oh, yes.
[06:18.05]She's in the room.
[06:19.60]You were drunk.
[06:20.78]Yes, I was.
[06:22.58]Alright.
[06:23.22]We gotta talk to Hamilton.
[06:24.88]Feeling better since this morning, Jessica?
[06:30.10]What?
[06:30.86]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[06:35.16]Who's talking?
[06:35.72]Alright, Jessica, how you feeling?
[06:42.86]Hard going back here after Red Dead.
[06:46.85]We might play Red Dead tonight.
[06:48.15]I don't know.
[06:51.77]Um, okay.
[06:53.84]Okay, so remember, here's where I can, here's the evidence, okay?
[07:00.03]There was a Chevy Style Line, boom, off the edge.
[07:02.63]The victims in that car may have been drugged.
[07:04.95]Somebody sent a letter to her, really worried about her, wants her to come home.
[07:09.98]It was underwear.
[07:10.74]There was a pair of underwear that I found and I picked them up.
[07:13.24]Then there was a shrunken head that was weighing down the pedal of the car that went off the edge.
[07:17.64]Remember, actress, not an actress, but might be at some point, might be a protege to the other actress.
[07:23.51]I'm ready.
[07:25.79]Can you tell me what you remember about the crash?
[07:29.43]It's all kind of fuzzy.
[07:31.11]I remember waking up here.
[07:33.53]Nothing happened yesterday.
[07:37.22]Okay, so she looks a little distraught.
[07:43.26]We're going to ease into this.
[07:44.86]You could have died in the crash, Jessica.
[07:47.59]Why would someone want to kill you?
[07:50.29]Someone wants to kill me?
[07:51.59]Got it.
[07:52.39]I wouldn't know anything about that.
[07:55.23]I just went along with Junie.
[07:56.85]She knows all about the movie business.
[07:58.89]See?
[08:00.33]Okay.
[08:01.55]So her parents sent her a letter.
[08:03.94]She might lie to me here.
[08:08.44]She looks a little distraught.
[08:09.52]Let's talk about the parents.
[08:10.36]You need to get in touch with your parents, Jessica, to tell them what has happened.
[08:14.44]Oh, you don't need to worry them.
[08:16.24]They sent me along to stay with Aunt June.
[08:18.40]It's a lie.
[08:19.20]They trust her to take care of me.
[08:21.32]That's not true.
[08:24.42]I can accuse here.
[08:25.36]I can show the letter, right?
[08:27.10]Or should I bad cop this?
[08:30.06]Or is that just doubt?
[08:30.96]Because, I mean, I do have the letter from Mom saying, come home.
[08:39.10]You're lying, Jessica.
[08:40.84]How are we going to make this right if you lie to us?
[08:44.46]Please, Detective, why would I lie to you?
[08:47.19]I got the letter to prove it.
[08:48.05]There.
[08:50.93]There.
[08:53.43]Because you're a runaway, Jessica, and you don't have your parents' permission to be here.
[08:56.81]Now, do you want to tell me what really happened?
[08:59.89]Got it.
[09:00.59]I went with Junie to this strange place.
[09:02.91]It's difficult to remember.
[09:05.06]Someone gave me a drink to calm my nerves, and then I felt faint.
[09:09.48]I think I must have passed out.
[09:12.84]Okay.
[09:15.89]So... How did you meet Mr. Bishop?
[09:18.05]Mr. Bishop is the guy that is involved.
[09:19.91]Junie is the big movie star.
[09:21.91]You probably know that.
[09:23.55]She's doing a new movie.
[09:27.12]No, that's a lie.
[09:27.92]Hold on, wait.
[09:29.72]Is that a lie?
[09:34.18]Was she in a movie?
[09:35.08]Was she in like a new movie coming up?
[09:37.64]I think she was.
[09:41.59]I think that's... Yeah, she was in a movie.
[09:44.69]What do you know about Bishop?
[09:46.55]I don't remember.
[09:47.11]It's movies.
[09:48.67]I had to do a screen test.
[09:50.15]Movies don't exist in the past.
[09:51.43]That's when you say some lines in front of the camera with the lights turned on you.
[09:56.64]Okay, what about criminal abuse?
[10:00.00]I know what happened to you, Jessica.
[10:02.32]Where exactly did it take place?
[10:05.18]Please, it's scary.
[10:07.72]It's really difficult to think of anything.
[10:10.94]Come on.
[10:12.78]Come on.
[10:15.01]What about... This is me on the green screen.
[10:25.63]We need the information.
[10:27.90]Someone tried to kill you, Jessica.
[10:29.40]Do you get it?
[10:30.26]Forget about being in movies.
[10:31.28]It's time to act like a grown up.
[10:34.05]I had to wear a robe and lay down on a stone.
[10:37.94]There were lights, a camera.
[10:40.98]It's not my fault.
[10:42.28]I'm not a bad girl.
[10:43.70]Tell us where he is.
[10:44.24]Why are you trying to hurt me?
[10:46.22]Tell us where he is.
[10:47.64]You should think about going home.
[10:48.74]One of four, correct?
[10:49.54]You're getting mixed up with people who treat you like last week's trash.
[10:52.39]What?
[10:52.93]Are you crazy?
[10:54.39]I can't go home.
[10:55.51]I want to be a star.
[11:00.47]How?
[11:02.90]I got the letter from the mom.
[11:05.32]She wants to be in movies.
[11:06.32]I didn't have any information.
[11:07.86]Look, the last time I saw this story was a month ago.
[11:26.78]If I read you the first five chapters of a book a month ago and then closed it, and then a month later I was like, oh hey, here's the next chapter, you're gonna be like, what are you talking about?
[11:35.02]What are we doing?
[11:39.04]Think of all the other pieces of media you've consumed in the last month.
[11:50.02]Ballard is definitely up to something.
[11:52.92]I don't even know what the specials were at the restaurant I went to last night.
[11:56.74]And that happened last night.
[11:57.68]That was last night.
[12:09.63]And damn, did they sound good, too.
[12:12.87]One of them had... It was a pino... pino... pino... pino sauce?
[12:20.65]White wine with some kind of fish.
[12:22.73]It was a wild-caught fish, too.
[12:24.20]And I almost bought it.
[12:25.98]But I don't know what it was.
[12:41.45]You know, I wish there was a thing you could do at restaurants, because they give you the menu, right?
[12:46.92]Waitress comes over, waiter comes over.
[12:48.36]Oh, here's your menu.
[12:49.48]Please take a look at it.
[12:50.24]And then they come back.
[12:51.86]Oh, by the way, here are the specials.
[12:54.32]No, I don't want to hear the specials.
[12:55.58]Put the specials on the menu.
[12:57.18]I can't remember this shit that you're telling me.
[13:00.98]You list off, like, nine different items and, like, ten different side dishes.
[13:03.98]It's like, put it on the fucking menu.
[13:05.14]Okay.
[13:12.72]I take cover at the door.
[13:14.62]I don't want to break in here just yet.
[13:18.10]Enter the cafe without being seen.
[13:19.55]Uh... I can't go through... Don't go through the door?
[13:33.03]Why would it tell me to go to the door?
[13:36.21]What?
[13:40.03]wrong door look we're in a restaurant right now I can't remember the specials they were reading specials as I was going up to the door is the guy gonna see me come
[14:20.93]That's a newspaper newspaper.
[14:22.17]That's a newspaper.
[14:31.56]No, I don't want him taught a lesson.
[14:34.32]You know what I want?
[14:35.20]Well, then make someone else do it.
[14:42.54]You still know people out here, don't you?
[14:45.44]Then make some calls.
[14:52.35]I'm gonna be very clear about this.
[14:54.51]You get this done or I'm... Wilson's Hotel.
[15:01.46]Mr. Mark Bishop, that son of a bitch, lives in apartment 803.
[15:06.68]Got it.
[15:08.82]Thanks for the info.
[15:11.26]Sure, I got the film.
[15:15.02]I got the film.
[15:16.66]Alright, I need to find the film.
[15:22.05]This is reading the newspaper very close.
[15:24.83]That would be really embarrassing.
[15:42.79]So what's the story?
[15:43.47]I'm guessing she didn't stop for life refreshments.
[15:45.98]She made a call.
[15:47.30]Sounds like Mark Bishop has a heap of trouble headed his way.
[15:50.28]I've got an address.
[15:51.41]Wilson's Hotel, apartment 803.
[15:54.54]Shit you better step on it.
[15:55.92]He's got any sense.
[15:57.06]He'll be as far away from home as possible Yeah, and he's the guy that didn't wouldn't have tried bumping off Guy McAfee's wife in the first place Or he's done the job properly McAfee will break a fella's legs just from looking at you know I went back back on the restaurant.
[16:10.00]What did you make of the kid you believe her story?
[16:13.12]I think she was don't out of her tiny mind and given the casting couch that fucking bitch ballard sold her out I
[16:20.82]Okay.
[16:22.04]So, what I... If Ballard was doing someone a favor, why did they try to kill him?
[16:27.61]What I want an arrest warrant.
[16:29.25]Take it easy, Phelps.
[16:30.59]I'd rather get there in one piece.
[16:33.69]I think I can fix this.
[16:37.11]All units in the vicinity in call 11K.
[16:39.04]11K, a 415 in front.
[16:39.78]Okay.
[16:50.27]Advice?
[16:55.45]You got any advice?
[16:57.45]Give me another car.
[16:59.61]Do we need to have that car?
[17:08.64]Come here.
[17:08.86]I don't want to go too far away.
[17:10.39]It'll fail the mission.
[17:13.07]I think I have to be in that car.
[17:18.47]What?
[17:19.29]I think I have to be in that car, don't I?
[17:30.42]Will he get in this?
[17:33.08]I might have to dislodge this car.
[17:36.35]Yeah, okay.
[17:43.20]I can't even get up there.
[17:49.46]How did I do this?
[17:50.12]I don't know.
[17:50.54]I just fell off the edge.
[18:00.83]Well, I hope I... I hope I don't need this guy.
[18:06.33]Just fall off the edge again and dislodge the car.
[18:08.95]I still have the marker.
[18:16.70]Delete your save.
[18:19.07]Is he running right now after the car?
[18:28.59]Can you imagine a cop taking your car to commandeer it to drive into their car that is stuck?
[18:37.37]That would be, yeah, that'd be pretty weird.
[18:49.97]You're a Loose Cannon, Jeremy.
[18:51.25]You're off the case.
[18:55.05]They need somebody like me.
[18:58.09]I might not do it well, but I get it done.
[19:03.87]Except for that.
[19:04.49]I mean, that was really well done.
[19:05.84]Wait, did he say turn right?
[19:11.32]Do I think he's in the car with me?
[19:21.43]Alright, he got up.
[19:23.31]Bishop's apartment.
[19:30.54]He gets the option to do good cop, bad cop, or accuse.
[19:32.68]Officer, that was a lie.
[19:33.66]Oh shit, yeah, it was.
[19:54.85]Sounds like we're about to make it a hat trick of hysterical female witnesses.
[19:59.82]Take the elevator where?
[20:00.50]He didn't say which floor.
[20:01.40]There's probably only... There's five, six floors apparently.
[20:04.50]He said last on the right.
[20:07.16]There it is.
[20:11.18]That's 80... No, that's not correct.
[20:12.85]Where's 803?
[20:19.55]804.
[20:19.67]He said on the right.
[20:20.77]Oh, did he say take a left?
[20:22.07]I don't know.
[20:22.49]Hello?
[20:22.87]Hello?
[20:26.85]Did he say take a left first?
[20:28.31]Are you in danger?
[20:29.16]I'm alright now.
[20:31.00]You just missed them.
[20:32.66]Horrible, awful men.
[20:34.20]Are you injured, Mrs.?
[20:35.84]Mrs. Bishop.
[20:37.48]Gloria Bishop.
[20:39.02]Please, come in, officers.
[20:40.57]No, this place was torn apart.
[20:42.21]I'll just need to sit down for a moment.
[20:44.73]Forgive me.
[20:45.59]That's perfectly normal, ma'am.
[20:46.97]Just look at this mess!
[20:49.13]We'll take a quick search of the premises, ma'am.
[20:51.16]You take a moment to gather your thoughts.
[20:55.03]Didn't you see her?
[20:56.49]No, no, that was somebody else.
[20:59.95]That was somebody else.
[21:01.55]Okay, so we got some stuff to look at.
[21:03.11]There's a vase.
[21:06.98]Put it down.
[21:07.42]Hmm.
[21:07.54]Is it the Bible?
[21:08.54]Hmm.
[21:08.62]Oh, no.
[21:08.78]God can't help us now, apparently.
[21:34.71]It's, uh, the Bible.
[21:36.93]What do you mean, uh, the Bible?
[21:38.87]It's the Bible.
[21:40.19]It doesn't appear to be connected.
[21:44.00]It's, what, it's a Bible?
[21:56.10]Presented to Mark.
[22:00.56]Okay.
[22:03.00]What about this?
[22:06.66]Fight game.
[22:13.07]Ooh, five dollars.
[22:16.11]I'll take it.
[22:17.11]Optimistic call.
[22:20.42]It's got some nice weight to it.
[22:27.64]I don't think so.
[22:28.84]No.
[22:30.38]Put it down.
[22:33.23]$25 bounty for stealing.
[22:34.29]Apparently it's Rockstar Week on this channel.
[22:39.93]But to be fair, they do make some of the best games.
[22:45.63]Old movie set.
[22:46.31]Anything on it?
[22:54.16]There's a bunch of stuff here.
[22:56.29]Great wall of Babylon.
[22:58.07]A replica of a replica.
[22:59.91]Movie set replica.
[23:03.65]Of a replica.
[23:06.55]But this is not made by a rock star.
[23:10.15]I don't think this is anything.
[23:11.93]But they pressed accept on it.
[23:15.07]You know what I mean?
[23:17.62]They opened the email with the file in it for the EXE.
[23:20.22]You know what I mean?
[23:28.37]I don't think there's anything else in here.
[23:29.77]What about this clock?
[23:31.53]No, I already did this.
[23:32.99]Alright, there's a painting.
[23:37.28]Alright.
[23:45.24]Kitchen.
[23:45.62]Secret room.
[23:54.05]Couple of melee weapons.
[23:55.11]I don't think I need these.
[23:57.77]Incidental.
[24:06.77]Nothing else?
[24:08.19]Just, like, coffee cups and shit.
[24:10.41]Doesn't give me anything to go on.
[24:13.84]The salad fork is gonna blow this case wide open.
[24:23.52]What is going on?
[24:24.76]What is happening in the chatroom?
[24:30.48]There was just an unleashing of a Jupiter storm.
[24:33.52]I need to get the... Looks like a mermaid in the background.
[24:48.74]Silver screen.
[24:50.40]What are these men in the picture?
[24:53.12]My husband, Mark, and Marlin Hopgood.
[24:56.70]They work together on occasion.
[24:58.70]That's Hopgood's shop.
[25:01.06]Hopgood.
[25:01.68]Marlin Hopgood.
[25:02.56]Okay.
[25:05.48]That's a new character.
[25:06.34]Not much help.
[25:13.11]There's a dog.
[25:14.47]Another time and place.
[25:16.33]Okay.
[25:25.94]I'm not talking yet.
[25:26.60]What about the piano?
[25:29.30]Nothing?
[25:31.66]Balcony?
[25:32.12]Okay.
[25:34.32]Anything else?
[25:35.88]Alright.
[25:54.96]Wait, wait, wait.
[25:56.10]Is there broken glass on the door?
[26:00.24]This door is, like, broken.
[26:02.51]This door is all fucked up.
[26:03.37]Can I close the door and look at it?
[26:11.37]I want to... I can't close this door to get a better look at it.
[26:18.97]Do a cool trick off the balcony.
[26:20.84]I can't.
[26:28.84]Apparently I'm missing something else.
[26:31.87]That, which I don't know, is the clock that I was talking about before I told you.
[26:37.61]Nope.
[26:38.41]Never mind.
[26:42.44]What were they looking for?
[26:43.48]Have you talked to the lady?
[26:49.64]I've not talked to the lady, but don't, don't... Isn't there another musical cue when you find all the clues?
[27:00.28]Can I offer you an egg in these trying times?
[27:04.18]What are you guys doing?
[27:10.64]Oh!
[27:12.67]That was a big gotcha moment.
[27:13.73]There's a check here.
[27:15.35]$20,000.
[27:18.73]You have to do to earn $20,000.
[27:22.77]Two.
[27:24.69]I can't.
[27:25.73]That's another language.
[27:26.53]I can't read it because it's cursive.
[27:29.05]Got it.
[27:37.93]Okay, hey, can I ask you some questions?
[27:44.72]What's up?
[27:46.98]So, what about that check on the ground?
[27:49.08]Who are you paying?
[27:50.28]I think they work for Guy McAfee.
[27:51.84]Do you know the name?
[27:53.82]No, why should I?
[27:55.69]June Ballard is married to Guy McAfee.
[27:57.98]Have you heard of her?
[28:00.12]That slut.
[28:01.58]She's been badgering my husband for days.
[28:04.18]Mrs. McAfee alleges that your husband tried to kill her and her friend last night.
[28:09.05]I think you should tell us what you know.
[28:12.25]My husband's a movie producer.
[28:14.19]This has something to do with his new picture.
[28:16.73]He doesn't include me in his business.
[28:22.17]What about the letter from your mother?
[28:26.09]She wants you to come home.
[28:40.18]Who wrote this check?
[28:56.97]I'm an officer of the law ma'am I don't believe it June Ballard said she had a deal to be in his new picture.
[29:21.25]I
[29:21.74]Mark repeatedly told her no.
[29:24.46]He had Joan Leslie lined up for the role.
[29:26.58]That's how he got the finals.
[29:28.62]June made all kinds of threats.
[29:30.93]She was very rude to me.
[29:32.43]You know June Ballard?
[29:33.45]We were both on the same picture a few years back.
[29:37.89]He's a dead eye.
[29:42.63]Do you know where Bishop is now?
[29:45.48]Where can we find your husband, ma'am?
[29:47.50]He told me he would be on set.
[29:49.04]That's all I know.
[29:51.06]Is it?
[29:56.36]She was practicing in the mirror for this part.
[30:01.85]What about this underwear?
[30:02.71]Do you know what this is?
[30:08.25]Either we find him or McAfee's people do, Mrs. Bishop.
[30:11.59]If you care for him, you should make sure that we find him first.
[30:16.37]I do care for him.
[30:18.68]But I don't really know where he'd go if he were in trouble.
[30:22.00]Hopgood might know.
[30:25.33]Okay, the trace address of prop store.
[30:28.63]Now who is this check for $20,000 for?
[30:30.39]Why is your husband paying Lorna Hopgood $20,000?
[30:33.74]Lorna?
[30:36.22]Marlon's ex-wife?
[30:39.66]Are you sure?
[30:42.06]Yeah.
[30:44.27]I've
[30:53.75]we got her I have the check but that's I don't accuse I mean I do have the check but she did but what if she didn't she didn't write it though let's get her you're lying Mrs. bishop it's some kind of payoff you know exactly what the money is for and who it's getting paid to do I would you like to prove that detective yeah I got the I got the check right here
[31:25.46]$20,000 made out to Lorna Hopgood on the account of Mark Bishop.
[31:31.53]I got it.
[31:38.62]Your husband looks like he's being blackmailed.
[31:40.86]They obviously have something on him.
[31:42.06]If he's prepared to kill to cover it up, why is the payment going to Hopgood and not McAfee?
[31:47.78]Lorna works at a check-cashing place in Hollywood.
[31:51.02]You need to ask Hopgood why he needs that much money in cash.
[31:56.44]Your husband is in trouble.
[31:58.08]It could go easier for him if you were more hopeful, Mrs. Bishop.
[32:01.89]Perfect score!
[32:02.21]Perfect score!
[32:02.51]You're a good boy, detective, and so are you.
[32:05.45]This is Hollywood.
[32:07.05]There's always a deal to be done.
[32:10.67]Uh, by the way, your necklace is out of focus.
[32:12.79]I just want to make sure, you know, you can take care of that.
[32:14.41]Alright, hello, I need to use the telephone.
[32:19.25]Operator, give me R&I.
[32:22.91]Putting you through now.
[32:26.66]Phelps, badge 1247.
[32:30.00]How could I help, detective?
[32:32.10]I need a location on a silver screen prop store.
[32:35.00]Just a moment.
[32:37.18]Smartest streamer on Twitch.
[32:38.38]Silver screen props, corner third.
[32:40.61]Thanks, man.
[32:41.79]Thanks.
[32:42.03]Alright, investigate silver screen props.
[32:50.46]Get out of the way.
[32:53.86]Use your own phone, get out of my house.
[33:01.04]Nice, open up your cell phone, man.
[33:04.68]I know this, like, takes place.
[33:06.12]Like, small complaint about the game.
[33:08.74]Like, I know this takes place in the 40s, but, like, fucking it's modern times now, man.
[33:12.35]Like, just let him have a phone or something.
[33:13.71]Like, let him have, like, a Palm Pilot with, like, GPS and everything.
[33:17.75]Like, it's really annoying.
[33:26.29]This game released in like 2007.
[33:27.09]I know it's like 1937 or 1942 or whatever it is, but... It's like, no gamer wants to play like this.
[33:35.91]Like, give me a fucking Palm Pilot.
[33:41.53]Mrs. Bishop knows more than she's letting on.
[33:43.53]She doesn't seem to realize how much trouble her husband is in.
[33:46.62]The LAPD are the least of their worries right now.
[33:48.72]Alright, what's the handbrake button?
[33:53.28]Maybe she's just loyal.
[33:54.64]No, they didn't have handbrake.
[33:56.42]Small complaint about the game.
[33:58.76]Like, I know it's like 1940, but like... Where the fuck... There's a handbrake on every car now.
[34:04.87]Just put like a handbrake in the game.
[34:06.25]It's like really irritating.
[34:21.81]There is a handbrake.
[34:23.21]I just pulled it.
[34:41.53]This, like, music... Like, small complaint about the game, like, fucking seriously.
[34:47.10]It's, like, 2007, 2008, and they're playing, like, this boring, dumb shit music.
[34:52.48]It's, like, fucking irritating.
[34:54.18]It was, like, Limp Bizkit.
[34:56.84]They put, like, current music on it.
[34:58.24]It's, like, fucking annoying.
[34:59.92]Watch what you're doing! ...
[35:10.90]Like, why can't I put my own custom playlist?
[35:12.50]I mean, they could, look, they can update the rosters on Madden and, like, MLB The Show and stuff.
[35:27.01]Why can't they update, like, the playlists in, like, the current radio stations?
[35:29.91]Fucking annoying.
[35:30.49]It's like, it's gonna get points off the game, like, for real, though.
[35:34.07]I mean, like, not to, just wanna make sure you guys are aware of that.

[36:40.62]Don't try my patience, knucklehead.
[36:45.58]Yeah, let's have a look around.
[36:51.35]Ooh, would you look at that?
[36:53.05]Ah, I found one of these at the crime scene.
[37:00.00]Didn't I?
[37:07.54]Looks eerily familiar.
[37:08.62]Is there a reason why I haven't said anything about that yet?
[37:18.72]Why won't I... Why won't I say anything about this?
[37:24.15]Do I have to find like a certain thing on it?
[37:25.53]Because he's not like, oh, they...
[37:40.66]There's a guy in there.
[37:41.34]Ah!
[37:41.42]This guy's got a peep den.
[37:43.40]And there's drugs here too.
[37:44.04]So this guy...
[38:06.53]This guy is a bad man.
[38:08.40]Well, gotcha.
[38:08.72]See, now you're fucked.
[38:38.40]Something else back here?
[38:43.87]No.
[38:44.03]Hold on.
[38:45.59]They're everywhere.
[38:46.41]I already know that.
[38:48.09]Yeah, I got a little sound stage.
[38:54.49]You're gonna rot.
[38:57.69]It's right here.
[39:08.73]There's like a secret button on the wall.
[39:12.78]How do I turn the light off here?
[39:16.20]Where's the book that I have to pull out for the wall to collapse?
[39:26.15]It's right back here.
[39:40.48]Toilet paper roll?
[39:42.04]Flush the toilet?
[39:45.24]Wait, hold on.
[39:51.34]Not everything here is going to be relevant.
[39:55.29]Oh, okay.
[40:03.93]Ah!
[40:05.65]In the dumpster.
[40:06.61]Secret dumpster entrance.
[40:09.82]No, never mind.
[40:18.95]Hold on.
[40:20.33]Do you really have a fucking, like, Acme Roadrunner?
[40:25.03]Set up where, I mean, if that was a cartoon, I'd be able to run through that.
[40:28.41]And then the guy behind me would chase me and smash into that.
[40:34.30]Why?
[40:34.64]Well, this is the 40s.
[40:36.00]So that was relevant.
[40:36.86]Those things did work on people back then.
[40:40.37]Okay, so we have a secret camera room.
[40:44.65]That's not fucked up at all.
[40:45.79]Okay.
[40:47.59]What's over here?
[40:48.95]What's that?
[40:52.27]There's the toilet.
[40:58.32]So why is... Okay, there's all these photos.
[41:07.86]I wonder if they saw this, how many budding starlets would still get on the bus to come to Hollywood.
[41:12.28]Okay.
[41:16.80]So, I was gonna say, why am I stuck there?
[41:19.56]Okay.
[41:29.71]We've got, oh, this is the film, I think, right?
[41:36.12]So we've got a, uh... These guys were running like a wicked fucked up, like, secret spy.
[41:47.09]Yeah.
[41:49.75]What are you gonna do with this?
[41:53.86]Phelps, put on gloves, man.
[41:55.16]You're tainting the scene.
[41:56.30]Let's take a look at this one.
[42:03.35]He's like creepy fucks just filming people behind the wall.
[42:09.71]Hmm.
[42:09.91]Interesting.
[42:10.27]Alright, I don't need any butterscotch.
[42:11.59]Okay.
[42:36.25]This is just somebody sat back here.
[42:41.38]So, somebody had to... It was a two-man... Two-man thing here.
[42:45.38]Because somebody had to operate the camera.
[42:47.46]They're both guilty.
[42:52.52]Anything else that I missed in here?
[42:55.54]Sure, I didn't... There's that.
[42:58.25]I got that.
[43:00.41]I got that.
[43:01.89]Nothing else?
[43:05.99]Well, that's it.
[43:10.99]But there is a bunch of this... this thing... Hmm.
[43:14.73]What about back here?
[43:18.60]Painting these... Alright.
[43:20.74]Well, this is very clearly... Okay.
[43:24.38]That's the one.
[43:25.88]Here are the molds.
[43:28.66]Should I take one of these?
[43:41.05]I guess that, yeah, that's just, they're just making them.
[43:45.85]This game, well, this game came out in 1940, because that's when it takes place.
[43:48.93]Don't flood streets.
[44:00.40]Cops chase war surplus contraband.
[44:02.56]Let's take a look.
[44:06.68]Listen, I have to call you back.
[44:08.59]I got some business here.
[44:09.57]Sit down, Courtney.
[44:11.03]This is Mickey.
[44:12.31]Mickey, this is Courtney Sheldon.
[44:14.91]What would you like to drink?
[44:16.03]Scotch.
[44:17.81]Straight up.
[44:19.10]I hear you're back at school learning to be a doctor, kid.
[44:21.24]Yes.
[44:22.28]That's right, Mr. Cohen.
[44:22.94]So you want to be a doctor and a dope peddler.
[44:27.06]Interesting combination, huh?
[44:30.73]Do we have a problem, Mr. Cohen?
[44:33.05]We might have.
[44:34.09]Yeah.
[44:35.53]Selling your dope to my boy Lenny looked like a good move, but Lenny has been supplying wholesale, so to speak.
[44:42.92]The bindle boys in this town aren't used to the juice without a little of the middleman taking his cut.
[44:49.28]Lenny promised that wouldn't happen, Mr. Cullen.
[44:51.90]And Lenny works for you.
[44:54.23]What can I say about Lenny?
[44:56.09]Let me think.
[44:57.71]Oh, yeah.
[44:58.25]He's a putz.
[44:59.54]And he's lazy.
[45:00.28]And he's greedy.
[45:01.08]But he's my wife's brother.
[45:02.00]What were the specials again?
[45:03.04]I don't remember.
[45:03.42]How did you make a cake with those ingredients, huh?
[45:08.08]That was a bad callback, but whatever.
[45:11.86]Well, kids, the only way we're going to be able to make this work is to do some repackaging.
[45:15.34]We need to get the dope out of those dinky little cardboard boxes.
[45:17.68]So we're putting them in the heads.
[45:20.09]Dope in the heads.
[45:21.19]Serrets.
[45:22.07]Great.
[45:23.25]Put it into a big vat so we can water it down a little bit.
[45:27.32]I won't bore you with the chemistry, but it doesn't work that way.
[45:32.01]You're likely to kill even more people.
[45:33.81]Okay, listen.
[45:35.07]We want to buy you out, kid.
[45:36.07]What did I eat last night?
[45:38.11]I'll offer you 50 grand.
[45:41.17]Water.
[45:42.64]There was water in... Hey.
[45:44.54]Hey.
[45:45.86]Salt.
[45:46.70]You don't like my offer?
[45:47.64]I forget everything else.
[45:57.59]Where'd the phone come from?
[45:58.67]Whose phone is this?
[45:59.45]I think I want him dead.
[46:02.79]Thanks for the part of the table under the seat telephone.
[46:12.78]The logistics of having a phone at that table back in 1940.
[46:15.50]That cable has to run through the whole restaurant.
[46:24.06]People are gonna trip over that.
[46:30.73]Alright, so we got some info here.
[46:33.21]There's, uh, dope is involved.
[46:40.38]Is there, like, I'm gonna cut one of these open and... Hello?
[46:55.07]I'm gonna cut one of those open and there's gonna be dope in there.
[46:58.95]Come on, let's go.
[46:59.99]Come on, girl.
[47:01.23]That's a good girl.
[47:05.89]I played that other game.
[47:06.79]I played that other game.
[47:11.48]And see?
[47:13.10]These were all taken from Red Dead.
[47:14.98]Didn't I tell you?
[47:19.26]Red Dead.
[47:20.30]Red Dead.
[47:21.62]Red Dead.
[47:26.79]That's a different game.
[47:30.14]Alright, I got enough evidence to put this guy away for life, so don't worry.
[47:38.83]Alright, skip the dialog.
[47:40.49]You're going away for life.
[47:46.81]You ever do any work for Mark Bishop?
[47:49.45]Mainly do work for the studios.
[47:51.41]RKO, Republic, Warner Brothers.
[47:54.52]So, yeah.
[47:55.72]When Bishop was doing work for a studio, yes.
[47:58.80]When did you last see him?
[48:00.73]Yeah, I'm doing work for his next picture.
[48:04.11]Still pre-production, though.
[48:06.17]Is it?
[48:06.41]I haven't seen him around here in a while.
[48:09.17]Really?
[48:09.47]Hmm.
[48:12.73]Haven't seen him around in a while, have you?
[48:15.47]This letter from your mother says otherwise.
[48:19.84]She's looking for you and she's worried about you.
[48:21.76]Alright, hold on.
[48:26.74]This is the movie set photograph, prop store photograph.
[48:32.18]When was this taken?
[48:39.53]There's gotta be like a date somewhere, right?
[48:41.50]Film reel.
[48:52.94]I mean, like, when was this taken?
[48:56.40]The mermaid statue.
[49:02.54]How would that prove, like, the date, though?
[49:04.50]Is there a date on here?
[49:10.74]What's the date?
[49:11.44]I mean, should I just accuse him and just pull the checkout?
[49:19.11]No, I mean, like, he's clearly in the photo here, but this is from...
[49:23.39]The mermaid movie.
[49:27.39]Do I have any other information besides that?
[49:35.86]I mean, this is... I don't know the date on here.
[49:39.86]This could be any time.
[49:48.94]Hold on a minute.
[49:56.82]You and Bishop are close friends, colleagues?
[50:00.53]It's business.
[50:02.39]I normally deal direct with the studio.
[50:05.85]Have you tried his production office?
[50:12.16]McAfee's men are looking for Bishop.
[50:14.00]We need to find him first.
[50:15.60]Any idea where he might have gone to ground?
[50:17.86]If he really tried to kill McAfee's wife, my advice to him would be to leave town.
[50:28.58]Like, none of these mean anything, though.
[50:30.46]What about, like, the fucking hidden cameras?
[50:32.30]Why can't I bring that up?
[50:35.46]I have, like, a check.
[50:37.73]Like, a photo of these two.
[50:44.53]How would that determine where he is?
[50:45.97]Do you know where he is?
[50:46.73]I have a photo of you two.
[50:54.33]And what about the drugs?
[50:55.55]I can't be like, hey, why do you have the... I can't just be like, what is this?
[51:06.68]You could hump a few props or sweep the floors if you got nothing better to do.
[51:11.16]Yeah, but that's not the question, though.
[51:12.86]The question was like, do you know where he is?
[51:15.50]Why isn't the first question, hey, what's with the drugs and cameras?
[51:29.20]I'm warning you, Hopgood, if you give him up to McAfee, if we find out about it... Wind it back a notch, tough guy.
[51:36.32]I'm telling you, I don't know where he is.
[51:39.56]That's all for now, Hopgood.
[51:40.82]We're taking you in.
[51:41.68]I don't understand.
[51:43.02]Phelps!
[51:44.52]How's... Roy Earl, Advice.
[51:46.42]Hold on a moment.
[51:47.86]This is clearly a vice case.
[51:49.99]You've been roughing up my informant?
[51:52.40]Hopgood is a vice informant?
[51:54.62]How would I know?
[51:55.18]How would I be able to get the information of... Look at that mug.
[51:57.81]Where is he?
[51:58.65]Have you been upsetting these two officers, Marlin?
[52:01.49]I have a picture of them two on a set, but when was that taken?
[52:06.17]You need to catch the movie producer before an angry husband does from what I'm hearing.
[52:10.39]I'll be making a full report to the captain, detective.
[52:13.05]You do that, kid.
[52:14.49]We're all very impressed with you.
[52:16.48]Let it slide, Cole.
[52:18.26]Let's get out of here.
[52:20.10]So is this the reason why I can't bring up all the other stuff?
[52:22.26]You're thinking too hard about it?
[52:26.24]Was it really just as simple as, here's a photo of you two?
[52:29.85]Like, that's it?
[52:30.25]You don't want to be taken in for obstruction of justice, do you boys?
[52:32.75]You could try the obstruction rap, but it won't stick.
[52:50.90]We could beat that.
[52:51.64]You've had your 10 cents worth, gentlemen.
[52:53.76]Bishop knows how the world works.
[52:55.84]Mrs. McAfee hits him up for a movie part, happens every day.
[52:59.18]It's the simplest answer.
[53:00.66]But Bishop takes it a step too far and tries to rub out Mrs. McAfee.
[53:04.83]Naturally, Guy is going to get upset.
[53:07.97]What made you think Bishop would be here?
[53:10.41]We figure he might be planning a little accident for Hopgood, too.
[53:14.27]Those two guys have got some unfinished business.
[53:17.69]You let us know if you find Bishop.
[53:20.24]Guy McAfee can be a very generous man.
[53:23.28]I'm only going to warn you once, gentlemen.
[53:25.13]Stay out of this.
[53:26.35]This is a police matter.
[53:27.91]We will be bringing Mark Bishop into custody.
[53:31.60]At least he's polite.
[53:33.38]Kind of dumb.
[53:34.72]But polite.
[53:35.44]But I'm a lot less polite, you smug son of a bitch.
[53:38.52]So let me put it in ruder terms.
[53:39.78]So it's just all red herrings and then one item is correct or something?
[53:43.42]Is that how this game works?
[53:46.07]Just pick up a bunch of evidence and then there's one question.
[53:48.95]Press this button on this one thing.
[53:50.53]You stay away from Bishop and you stay away from me.
[53:54.33]Is that clear enough for you, asshole?
[53:56.77]Now run along back to your boss so we can pat you on the head and tell you what good boys you are.
[54:11.04]Why would you start shooting?
[54:14.60]Okay.
[54:19.60]What?
[54:19.94]That came out of nowhere?
[54:20.88]I didn't do anything.
[54:24.86]Should I shoot?
[54:25.34]They really don't want anybody to get the bishop before they do.
[54:29.81]Lighten to his wheel arches.
[54:31.27]Come on.
[54:33.05]Am I supposed to... Am I in action here?
[54:37.03]I can't take the shot from here, Cole.
[54:43.17]Alright, shoot him.
[54:45.37]Oh, there are two cars here.
[54:48.39]Need to lose those fools, folks.
[54:51.07]Keep it steady.
[54:52.43]I'll try and bust his tires.
[54:54.59]Okay.
[54:55.77]It worked, but... That guy's getting stepped on.
[55:04.93]Why would you get out of the car?
[55:08.01]Make a move.
[55:08.57]We're sitting ducks here.
[55:19.52]Alright, I did it.
[55:19.92]Let's see him chase us now.
[55:21.96]On to the movie set, Phelps.
[55:23.26]Let's roll.
[55:25.11]Oh, Christ.
[55:26.35]When they say working traffic is like watching paint dry.
[55:29.56]You know how to piss people off, Bukowski.
[55:31.94]Hey, if they're prepared to gun down cops in broad daylight, McAfee really means business.
[55:36.88]Seems like we're the only ones who want Bishop alive.
[55:39.48]I have a good mind just to let him go work on the son of a bitch.
[55:42.86]I'm about done putting my life on the line to protect some child molester.
[55:46.47]That's our job, unfortunately.
[55:48.87]They don't get to dole out the justice.
[56:02.96]Well, alright.
[56:03.76]So I think I'm understanding.
[56:07.73]Go investigate the guy's sick fucking perverted place.
[56:15.65]Do you have a photograph of me and him?
[56:18.13]Yes.
[56:19.31]Okay, that's it.
[56:19.89]Bye.
[56:49.86]I mean, you need evidence.
[56:51.76]Yeah, but that whole fucking house was a giant ball of evidence.
[56:59.15]That guy was standing, essentially, at the scene of the murder, with blood all over his body, and three screaming people, dead and, like, screaming, dying.
[57:08.13]Mark Bishop, stop!
[57:09.54]LAPD!
[57:12.20]He's not very fast either.
[57:27.78]We're trying to help you, Bishop!
[57:35.54]This is all a big mistake!
[57:41.97]He takes it uphill.
[57:48.64]That was the mistake, you're right.
[57:57.14]It's us or McAfee's boys.
[57:58.72]Your choice.
[57:59.30]I didn't do anything!
[58:02.45]You didn't do anything?
[58:05.57]Come here!
[58:06.67]I have a photograph I want to show you.
[58:21.07]Bishop, that's enough!
[58:24.95]The letter from your mother, she's worried sick!
[58:34.86]Yeah, that's right, now you stay right there, and what's this check made out to you, sir?
[58:49.37]Oh, shit!
[58:56.72]Mark Bishop, stop!
[58:58.08]LAPD!
[58:59.49]I didn't know that was possible.
[59:00.51]I thought this was just a run... I didn't know it was possible.
[59:04.17]And plus, I'm like reading chat during this run behind the guy.
[59:16.71]Sorry.
[59:17.17]We're trying to help you, Bishop!
[59:22.85]This is all a big mistake!
[59:40.47]We both did the same thing.
[59:41.73]We both learned how to jump from the same sensei, apparently.
[59:47.12]Dead?
[60:08.92]Mark Bishop, you're under arrest for the attempted murder of June Ballard and the rape and attempted murder of Jessica Hamilton.
[60:16.53]Alright, now come quietly.
[60:18.07]Just don't kill me.
[60:20.25]If you found me, then McAfee's goon will too.
[60:24.47]We need to get out of here.
[60:28.52]Alright, but you stay close.
[60:29.62]Any tricks and I'll save McAfee's boys the trouble.
[60:32.52]Follow me.
[60:33.72]I know another way out of this place.
[60:41.95]I was gonna make an elaborate, like... How to stop the McAfee boys.
[60:49.61]Just install a program that uses the internet.
[60:54.99]It'll break everything.
[60:55.73]They won't know what to do.
[61:00.70]R2, I forgot.
[61:10.44]kill them for god's sake I don't want to die pop it up shoot the barrels to the stroll of the wall you said you knew where you were going we have to jump for it lapd I'm not very good at this I'm not very good at this
[61:39.31]Is this really the best McAfee's got?
[61:45.87]Am I not hit?
[61:57.75]What is going on right now?
[61:59.07]Okay, what the fuck is happening?
[62:04.99]Do I need, like, a different weapon?
[62:06.84]Press X to pick a weapon.
[62:08.66]What do we have?
[62:10.94]Am I too far away to shoot these guys with this?
[62:12.68]What are you doing?
[62:17.84]Why?
[62:18.46]What's he going down for?
[62:25.40]Okay, honest to God.
[62:29.14]Damn!
[62:30.10]Brain.
[62:31.14]Okay, very finally.
[62:32.02]Now I'm out of brain.
[62:43.46]Just curve the bullets.
[62:47.15]Bishop's dead.
[62:47.81]Okay.
[62:49.37]Pick up the rod.
[62:49.99]I pressed X on it.
[62:51.17]It didn't do anything.
[62:52.47]I saw pick up weapon like three times, and I pressed X. Okay, now I have it.
[63:00.36]Weird.
[63:00.68]Why would you do that?
[63:02.18]Get out of there!

[63:43.77]Where the hell was he before?

[63:56.78]Well, I... I got news for you!
[64:07.76]It doesn't matter how much you train in console airing.
[64:11.04]It either auto-targets, or you have an eye closed.
[64:15.28]That's just kind of how it works.
[64:22.46]What are you doing?
[64:23.62]What are you doing?
[64:24.14]Get off.
[64:24.42]Those barrels at the base of the element column!
[64:32.60]They're full of gasoline!

[65:47.06]Who's left?
[65:47.46]Okay, got him.

[66:05.61]Oh, by the way, it just came in.

[66:07.29]RT Game Crowd for the raid.
[66:08.29]Welcome, everybody.
[66:08.81]Thank you.
[66:09.17]I didn't catch it.
[66:37.28]Welcome, welcome, everybody.
[66:58.09]I turned my lights on.
[67:01.10]Phelps, Bukowski, this your work?
[67:03.94]Can I help you, Detective?
[67:05.88]Sorry, Cap.
[67:06.74]Didn't see you there.
[67:07.74]Yeah, I'll bet you didn't.
[67:09.33]This is a traffic case.
[67:10.55]You need something?
[67:11.59]I'm here to buy a drink for the two LAPD traffic cops who broke the back of Guy McAfee's private army.
[67:17.71]You don't have a problem with that, do you, Captain?
[67:21.29]Go right ahead.
[67:23.38]Get in.
[67:24.46]I'm buying.
[67:42.05]You'll like this place.
[67:42.99]A lot of movie people hang out here.
[67:45.07]You like jazz, Cole?
[67:46.33]The hopheads love it.
[67:47.65]Sure, I guess.
[67:48.91]Big bands and swing, I can understand, but this bebop palaver?
[67:52.13]How are you supposed to dance to that?
[67:58.68]This is Phelps, Leroy.
[68:00.10]Be nice to him.
[68:01.60]You'll like this place.
[68:02.94]They treat you right.
[68:07.13]You like a table, Roy?
[68:08.87]What do you think we want to do?
[68:10.17]Stand at the bar like chumps?
[68:11.33]I'll get a table ready for you.
[68:12.73]Don't look so happy to see me, Alphonse.
[68:14.57]I might get the wrong impression.
[68:16.31]Should I accuse this guy?
[68:17.05]This is Alphonse.
[68:18.42]He's a French Negro from Africa.
[68:20.32]Can you beat that?
[68:21.14]The Congo.
[68:22.52]Pleasure to meet you, Alphonse.
[68:23.60]Wasn't this guy, I want to like accuse this guy.
[68:24.90]Wasn't this guy like a bad guy, like just not even 15 minutes ago?
[68:27.16]Come on, Cole.
[68:27.58]You can meet Elsa while they're fixing us a table.
[68:30.04]You'll like her.
[68:31.12]She's something else.
[68:32.10]Maybe another night, Roy.
[68:33.92]She's pretty beat up about it.
[68:35.62]Get your hands off me.
[68:37.59]Don't ever tell me what to do or what not to do, Alphonse.
[68:41.36]You got a nice club here.
[68:43.14]Don't spoil it.
[68:44.04]If you will follow me, detectives.
[68:48.67]Just through the door.
[68:52.89]He was my only real friend, Harlan.
[68:56.23]We went through it all.
[68:58.40]You realize what he meant to me?
[68:59.99]Of course I do.
[69:00.79]You have no idea.
[69:02.03]You said it was construction work.
[69:04.15]It was an industrial accident, Elsa.
[69:07.19]How can I be held responsible?
[69:09.02]Elsa, are you going on?
[69:10.66]Louis Ricard said he was my best friend.
[69:14.38]The only man who ever loved me without putting his hands on me.
[69:18.70]Hi, Elsa.
[69:19.82]Here's someone I'd like you to meet.
[69:21.64]Cole Phelps.
[69:22.79]War hero and crime fighter extraordinaire.
[69:25.81]And why would I want to meet another fascist from the L.A.B.D.?
[69:31.81]Sorry about this, Cole.
[69:33.79]What an evening I'm having.
[69:35.11]First a negro puts his hands on me, and then this.
[69:39.33]Who do you think you're talking to, you Jerma junkie whore?
[69:41.99]I told you, this guy sucks.
[69:43.89]Do you hear me?
[69:48.54]Evenin', doc.
[69:49.58]How's business?
[69:51.36]Sanguine.
[69:53.34]Louie, help me here.
[69:55.24]I'm gonna have to give her something before her performance.
[69:58.12]Blow it off, Cole.
[69:59.36]These artsy-fartsy types always get a little flighty.
[70:02.64]Meet Dr. Harlan Fontaine, doctor to the stars.
[70:06.57]Mr. Fix-It to the mental wreckage of Hollywood.
[70:13.21]So what about that drink, boys?
[70:23.53]Alright!
[70:40.86]Case closed.
[70:41.74]13.
[70:45.52]Not great.
[71:00.94]Gets raided, says nothing.
[71:02.38]What?
[71:02.82]I just talked about it for like a full minute.
[71:06.20]What are you on about?
[71:21.10]Only a minute?
[71:36.43]Alright, gentlemen, take your seats.
[71:39.04]Let's get this over before lunch.
[71:41.76]Flight Rose of the Homicide Squad has decided to take care of the retirement.
[71:45.92]Sounds good.
[71:46.54]We will all miss Floyd and the steely edge he brought to his police work.
[71:50.97]The department has arranged a wee drink at the Galway Arms to quench the mighty thirst a man gets from 25 years of police work.
[72:01.08]Floyd's departure leaves a place at the top table, and the chief has seen fit to promote Cole Phelps from burglary to the homicide desk.
[72:09.91]Stand up, Phelps.
[72:10.97]Take a chair.
[72:14.21]You're in the major leagues now, Sonny.
[72:16.96]Rusty Galloway, a fine lawman of the old school, will be taking you under his wing.
[72:24.26]Your first case is the murder of a woman found last night and bearing all the signs of the werewolf.
[72:30.35]Get out to the scene, lads.
[72:39.28]Okay.
[72:40.82]Streets of LA Lounge is a patrol city and attends street crimes.
[72:44.24]Each desk offers a new set of street crimes.
[72:45.92]Okay.
[72:46.08]I didn't come to California to be a secretary.
[72:50.42]Do you have the address?
[72:52.12]It's been all over KGPL.
[72:53.64]It's off Temple Street, between Belmont and Glendale.
[72:59.42]Get the sensor bar ready.
[73:00.56]Oh boy, we're about to see... I mean, I have a giant one that's ready, so... Ow.
[73:05.64]Alright, let's go.
[73:30.51]What happened to Rose?
[73:31.79]Parker wants the chief's job.
[73:33.57]Word is it's either gonna be him or Thad's one, so they're both clearing the decks.
[73:37.71]Where does that leave you, Galloway?
[73:39.33]We got a call.
[73:39.97]Leaves me saddled with a chump like you, Phelps.
[73:43.15]I didn't ask for you, and I don't want you, so keep it to yourself.
[73:46.87]See if you can learn something about real cop offerings.
[73:51.52]What did he mean by the werewolf?
[73:53.60]Medallion.
[73:55.17]He's ruined the surprise.
[73:56.63]Why would you...
[74:09.18]Don't do that.
[74:10.04]I don't.
[74:11.74]90% of murders are domestic, Phelps.
[74:13.82]Some guy gets into a beef with his wife, he takes it too far.
[74:16.18]This will be the same.
[74:18.78]But cutting someone in half... This is very far away.
[74:20.87]This is a very far away crime that happened over here.
[74:26.11]Alright, what's the deal?
[74:34.78]Possible jumper?
[74:37.52]Oh, Jesus.
[74:39.79]I don't- I don't trust this guy.
[74:41.75]Alright, so I gotta get up there and I gotta prevent him from jumping.
[75:08.61]I don't know why for a second.
[75:09.29]I thought he was going to kick me.
[75:11.13]I'll bring you down with me, Phelps.
[75:12.83]Come on, then.
[75:26.28]No offense.
[75:27.06]Should we not be sprinting at him like this?
[75:30.32]Are you crazy?
[75:31.70]What are you trying to do?
[75:35.11]I remember my first jumper.
[75:36.81]Could have...
[75:38.62]He's not just gonna do it, right?
[75:39.88]Should I not have sprinted up there?
[75:42.66]Like as fast as I can?
[75:44.90]This what you wanted?
[75:45.96]I can't do it.
[75:48.63]I just... I'll come quietly, just... I need some help.
[75:54.71]Please.
[75:55.79]You gotta get me some help.
[75:56.89]I made it.
[76:03.26]You're a danger to yourself and to others.
[76:08.05]Why is everybody cheering?
[76:11.47]I just gave like that.
[76:12.31]That's right.
[76:12.83]Everybody down there in my audience.

[77:42.05]This music.
[77:43.35]No engine sounds.
[77:47.07]I feel like I should be searching for hidden objects.
[77:49.19]I don't know why that's what I think of.
[77:52.18]Give me a break!
[78:04.23]I'll take it Bank of America Alright, let's go I want to do like all these

[79:49.89]Police!
[79:50.23]You can't do this!
[80:00.86]Does this even have engine sounds?
[80:04.08]Kind of.

[80:11.16]Alright, but honestly, God, though, can you do that?
[80:21.80]FBI, I'm taking the car.
[80:24.64]You can?
[80:28.18]I don't know if I would believe that person.
[80:29.76]You know what I'm saying?
[80:30.64]Like, you could go get a fake badge from the party store and just be like, LAPD, I need your car.
[80:36.25]Uh, what?
[80:47.40]Bank robbery, what's the situation half a dozen shooters, sir?

[81:16.06]I got an achievement made out of wood.
[81:20.88]Can you get off of this, please?
[81:33.13]How long do you think you can hold out?
[81:45.39]And I sometimes just feel like my character's a fucking magnet.
[81:51.10]And I'm running through the polar field.

[82:51.68]Just you and me.
[82:53.08]You can't live to tell the tale.

[84:00.44]It's the same view.
[84:01.49]What is this?
[84:05.07]Everybody's listening to the same song.
[84:14.51]Either that or this is the intro.
[84:17.69]to a British television mystery show.
[84:21.92]This is where the credits show up.
[84:23.14]Calm down!
[84:26.58]And Arthur Bradbury as Detective Doohickey.
[84:51.39]Gotta play some hidden object games now.
[85:00.97]I was thinking about it.
[85:04.97]Oh my god, this is more sidetracking than in Red Dead.
[85:12.73]But I have to do it though, because these are all interesting.
[85:14.59]Oh, I almost bowled that guy.
[85:26.31]Do the murder investigation.
[85:27.48]Um, what about these murder investigations?
[85:31.74]Bank of America.
[85:32.48]Guy jumping off the building.
[85:37.43]I need to do these too.
[85:42.37]How is this stalling?
[85:43.65]I'm playing the game.
[85:46.05]Stalling would be this.
[85:49.92]Hey, um, does anybody know, uh, does anybody know what time Evo starts?
[85:56.10]Uh, it's like next month, right, or something?
[86:02.65]That's stalling.
[86:05.05]I'm playing.
[86:05.61]What am I doing?
[86:17.01]How can you be stalling if you're playing the content in the game that you're playing?
[86:22.61]No way I'm going down without a fight.
[86:26.24]Maybe if I turned on the webcam... Drop the weapon!
[86:28.58]Hands behind your head!
[86:29.70]There's always a cop that's just Kenny from South Park.
[86:33.52]He dies instantly.
[86:34.76]Put your hands in the air!
[86:42.69]Give it up!
[86:43.57]LAPD!
[86:52.83]Get that up!
[86:59.12]That guy can't scare him?
[87:00.04]Well, he's not a horse.
[87:03.44]I'm not trying to kill him, I'm trying to scare him, so he goes... How did he get up there?
[87:14.46]A ladder.
[87:15.24]Perfect.
[87:15.60]I'm not trying to shoot him, I'm trying to make him freak out.
[87:23.74]Oh, he's so fucking far away, though.
[87:25.35]I'm gonna have to shoot him.
[87:27.11]Alright, now stop.
[87:32.73]Give up.
[87:33.05]Try not to shoot him like the feet.
[87:38.99]Surrender now, or I will use deadly.
[87:43.18]Stop it!
[87:45.58]Alright, got him.
[87:59.15]Alright, you're going to jail.
[88:04.75]See?
[88:04.89]I didn't use any force there.
[88:06.25]Everybody would then like to make fun of me for... Oh, Gerber just shot him in the head, no?
[88:27.87]I need to find those mystery coins.
[88:43.18]I didn't kill him.
[88:43.88]What do you mean I killed him?
[88:46.12]He's just going to be missing a few toes.
[88:58.59]Code 4 means dead.
[89:01.71]No, it doesn't.
[89:11.10]No, what?
[89:13.98]Yes, it does.
[89:14.76]Connect 4 means you won the fucking round and you go on to play the next one.
[89:18.33]He's fine.
[89:19.75]He just had a couple of bruises.
[89:25.21]I don't know the police numbers.
[89:26.65]I don't know the police numbers!
[89:33.70]They just make them up.
[89:34.88]That's not real.
[89:37.20]That's just like a police movie TV show thing.
[89:40.00]We got a code 141-2652 at South Point 4 Boulevard.
[89:42.19]It's all just, it's like saying 555-5555 for a telephone number.
[89:44.81]Crime scene is just up a dirt road, detective.
[90:06.12]Oh, get the sensor ready.
[90:07.99]I got a haircut.
[90:09.61]How about a scoop for the examiner, Galloway?
[90:11.43]You could use some good press.
[90:12.65]Another tramp, another message.
[90:14.39]Is the werewolf back in business, boys?
[90:16.21]Do you have a mother, asshole?
[90:17.47]A sister?
[90:18.29]How about showing some respect for this poor woman?
[90:20.35]Let us do our job, and Detective Galloway will give you a statement later.
[90:24.71]He's good, Rusty.
[90:26.05]He even sounds genuine.
[90:27.33]That's Phelps, guys.
[90:28.67]The war hero.
[90:30.07]Offending the honor of murdered humps.
[90:32.47]They're used to it, Phelps.
[90:34.47]Blood.
[90:34.61]Shrieks.
[90:34.77]Tree.
[90:34.89]Body.
[90:35.05]Oh.
[91:06.72]Trollman, this your beat?
[91:07.88]Yes, sir.
[91:08.86]Well, part of it.
[91:10.06]Kids park here, they use it like a lover's lane.
[91:13.36]It's a working neighborhood.
[91:15.58]Some trouble, but... nothing like this.
[91:20.06]It's known locally as the Moors.
[91:22.08]You were first on the scene?
[91:23.34]Yes, detective.
[91:24.57]No one's disturbed the body?
[91:26.53]No, sir.
[91:27.37]We cleared out them vulture reporters so Pinker and the coroner could work.
[91:30.09]They're waiting to talk to you.
[91:32.01]Go house to house and see what you come up with.
[91:36.49]This ain't going to work.
[91:37.21]Too bad.
[91:41.13]Hold on.
[91:41.47]It's not going to work.
[91:50.51]It's not going to work, guys.
[91:54.25]This is an adult part of the stream.
[91:57.03]If you're not at least allowed to go to an R-rated movie, then you've got to get out of here.
[92:06.98]Okay.
[92:14.51]Cause of death?
[92:16.13]Could be the head injuries.
[92:17.73]She has been badly stomped.
[92:19.93]The cuts look superficial.
[92:22.07]I'll know for sure in an hour.
[92:32.32]What caused the blunt force injury to the face?
[92:35.60]Could be anything from a baseball bat to a lug wrench.
[92:38.64]I'll have more details after the autopsy.
[92:41.32]So you're allowed to go to an R-rated movie if your parents let you.
[92:44.53]Yeah, but your parents need to be watching the stream with you.
[92:48.95]You can't prove that to me.
[92:50.07]Okay.
[93:03.44]Fuckin' Jesus Christ.
[93:04.80]Am I gonna get in fuckin' trouble for this shit?
[93:15.35]I don't know!
[93:15.87]Hmm.
[93:28.50]Interesting.
[93:37.08]Okay.
[93:38.68]Anything else?
[93:41.70]It's not gonna work.
[93:45.40]What about this wound on the finger?
[93:46.70]Missing ring?
[93:47.78]Okay.
[94:07.51]I don't know.
[94:08.11]I don't know what to do.
[94:09.83]Whatever.
[94:13.97]If you're not at least 17 with the parents' permission, you're not allowed to watch this stream at this point forward.
[94:20.10]That goes for all of you.
[94:22.52]18, you're not allowed to be here.
[94:25.76]Unless your mother told you it was okay.
[94:37.08]No, I don't, in fact, no, in fact, no, you're not even allowed to be here.
[94:40.13]Even if you, I don't, if you, even if you put on the sentence, okay, you're not supposed to be here.
[94:43.53]You understand?
[94:54.45]Okay, I got it.
[94:55.27]What's the writing on the victim mean?
[94:57.34]BD.
[94:58.38]Lactalia.
[94:59.76]Tex.
[95:01.06]Your guess is as good as mine.
[95:02.98]Could be something to it, or it could be the killer's trying to throw you off the scent.
[95:06.64]Either way, I'll run tests on the lipstick.
[95:08.96]Any idea of the time of death?
[95:10.74]From the temperature, I'd say after midnight.
[95:13.00]I'll confirm with you later.
[95:17.38]Oh!
[95:20.62]Oh, my God.
[95:21.42]I thought that was...
[95:29.96]What can you tell me about the shoe prints?
[95:32.58]Men's size 8s.
[95:34.06]Pinker lifted impressions for me to compare back at the lab.
[95:37.75]Size 8.
[95:40.43]Men's size 8, and one of them has bird shit all over it.
[95:59.47]Look at a globe.
[96:00.17]Looks like some kind of puzzle or parlor game.
[96:07.15]It opens up and there's going to be chocolate inside.
[96:09.33]Okay.
[96:21.32]Okay.
[96:23.14]See, that's the top half of North America and this is the bottom half of North America.
[96:31.75]Okay, like that there's a couple islands in between no not quite maybe a little bit more there we go, okay Done there it is Alright now I really I like actually fucked it up so hold on it's gonna line up like this
[96:59.43]There's no sense of any globe geography.
[97:11.57]Oh, I couldn't even do it.
[97:16.98]The property of the Bomba Club, North Spring Street, downtown.
[97:21.06]That's not real.
[97:21.98]See, I told you.
[97:31.80]Uh, Swiggity Swanky just gave $50 right now.
[97:33.90]50.
[97:34.56]50 bucks from Swiggity Swanky.
[97:38.09]Uh, to prevent a Twitch ban, delete the VOD.
[97:40.43]No, like, that's... Delete the evidence?
[97:43.41]I'm playing a detective game right now, and you want me to delete evidence.
[97:47.73]That would go against Connor Phelps' code of conduct here.
[97:51.30]I'm not gonna do that.
[97:57.00]Thank you so much for the 50 bucks, though.
[98:00.81]Really appreciate it, dude.
[98:01.43]That's a lot of money.
[98:01.99]Thank you.
[98:13.32]We've got keys.
[98:16.22]Battery.
[98:19.94]I was gonna just... I don't know why I was just gonna say this.
[98:24.22]And you're talking about me being concerned about, like, TOS?
[98:28.59]I was about to just say two words.
[98:30.93]That was it.
[98:32.75]Three letter, four letter.
[98:34.61]That's all I was going to say.
[98:38.00]Yeah.
[98:39.40]I don't know why I just was going to say that.
[98:45.26]What's wrong with me?
[98:46.78]What have you guys done to me?
[98:49.92]I used to be so wholesome.
[98:50.93]I didn't even swear.
[98:51.95]Can we get to the bomba?
[98:54.93]A man could die of thirst in a case like this.
[99:05.07]Dude.
[99:07.77]Come on.
[99:08.33]15 seconds.
[99:08.57]I got the achievement.
[99:09.43]15 seconds.
[99:09.81]But jump over three things.
[99:10.63]Alright.
[99:22.06]How about we go to the Bomba?
[99:23.56]The Bomba.
[99:37.41]Watch where you're driving, you maniac!
[99:40.15]My name's Jeremiah.
[99:40.85]I just look at map and see that I drive that way.
[99:45.93]Blip is straight ahead.
[99:47.39]I drive straight ahead.
[99:53.82]Me and Jeremiah, we just fall off.
[99:56.14]Cole, come on!
[99:58.00]Okay, we go right by now.
[100:00.55]This is a cookie monster.
[100:01.95]This is not in the right voice.
[100:03.45]The werewolf?
[100:04.29]For my money?
[100:05.38]Copycat.
[100:06.32]We can't rule it out.
[100:07.22]We need to work the evidence.
[100:08.96]You'd love that, wouldn't you?
[100:10.48]A big head to hang on your wall.
[100:12.43]The caller of the decade.
[100:14.21]I've been working evidence in a BD case for six months and got nicks.
[100:17.95]There's a difference, Rusty.
[100:19.65]Yum.
[100:20.27]I just started working it today.
[100:22.23]Oh, cookies.
[100:24.14]Cookies.
[100:25.76]Cookies.
[100:28.52]He clearly has a thing for power.
[100:30.12]Power over women.
[100:31.18]Why not power over the police department as well?
[100:33.82]Let me finish, guys.
[100:35.34]A guy opens his mouth again after six minutes.
[100:38.73]Gently.
[100:40.89]Come on.
[100:41.85]I don't got all day.
[100:45.09]I turned off the dialog.
[100:59.23]That's not totally fantastical.
[101:01.75]Turn on cinematic camera?
[101:05.03]Can you?
[101:05.81]There's a reason we didn't get the son of a bitch after the short murder was them locusts.
[101:10.88]Where do you think the werewolf killer is now?
[101:13.36]Where do you think the cookies are now?
[101:18.36]San Quentin?
[101:19.38]Another town?
[101:20.52]Another country?
[101:21.26]Who knows?
[101:22.68]So, Phelps, I understand you want to turn this into a big case, but it doesn't work like that, alright?
[101:26.80]A case will come and find you.
[101:28.70]Can't make it something it ain't, understand?
[101:30.98]So you don't think the werewolf has continued to operate in the Los Angeles area?
[101:34.82]No chance.
[101:35.42]We would have found him.
[101:39.02]All units in the vicinity in any central unit, a 2-11 has shot his fire at 410 South Flower Street.
[101:45.43]Units that can handle code 3, identify.
[101:50.67]Just go easy, Phelps.
[101:54.78]Oh, yes, I agree.
[102:27.90]Say something.
[102:40.89]Gentlemen, what can I get you?
[102:43.00]Phelps and Galloway, LAPD.
[102:44.26]Chocolate milk.
[102:45.14]Were you walking here last night?
[102:46.48]Yes.
[102:47.56]How can I help, officer?
[102:49.02]You can start with your name.
[102:50.84]Garrett Mason.
[102:52.30]You're the regular bartender on Nuts?
[102:53.67]Lie.
[102:54.11]I'm a temporary barman.
[102:55.79]I work for an agency.
[102:57.63]I fill in at bars across town.
[102:59.09]Do you remember a woman who came in here last night?
[103:01.57]Five feet seven, about 110 pounds, blonde hair, about 40 years of age.
[103:07.30]You mean Celine Henry.
[103:10.94]You know her name?
[103:11.92]Yes.
[103:13.31]Do you know anything about her?
[103:14.93]I don't.
[103:15.97]But the owner, Mr. McCall, serves her most nights.
[103:18.81]Would you like to speak to him?
[103:19.85]I would.
[103:21.39]He sits at the back of the club.
[103:23.07]Wears a hibiscus.
[103:24.23]You can't miss him.
[103:26.03]Is there anything else?
[103:28.83]Quiet away, Phelps.
[103:30.21]I'll stay here.
[103:30.89]I'm a little parched.
[103:33.07]Pour me Three Fingers of rye.
[103:36.87]Say, honey, what time do you get off work?
[103:41.14]Where is he?
[103:41.40]Do you want a tip?
[103:42.43]Refill my coffee next time, honey.
[103:44.21]That's probably the guy just sitting back here by himself.
[103:48.29]Detective Phelps, LAPD.

[103:52.11]Do you know her?

[104:55.51]He's been in a couple of times.
[104:58.08]Did they leave together?
[104:59.50]Yes.
[105:00.64]At around 11.
[105:02.46]If it helps, I made the guy's license plate.
[105:08.98]Ooh.
[105:13.43]I think this could be a great help, sir.
[105:15.77]Thank you.
[105:16.55]2B8899.
[105:19.77]Okay.
[105:21.69]Anything else?
[105:22.17]That's it.
[105:24.17]You're a license plate maker.
[105:29.30]Alright, so she's missing her ring.
[105:31.60]Mrs. Henry appeared to be missing a ring torn from her finger, but not her wedding finger.
[105:36.60]Selene always wore a red garnet ring on the large side.
[105:42.07]Oh yeah?
[105:42.43]Really?
[106:02.22]You got an itch in your ass, or what's happening here, man?
[106:04.20]I think you know where the ring came from, and I think you're gonna tell me.
[106:07.52]Okay.
[106:08.68]I bought it years ago.
[106:10.18]Got him.
[106:11.06]I carried a torch for Selene in those days.
[106:14.32]Guess I always have.
[106:15.16]Her old man never knew about it.
[106:20.65]Okay.
[106:22.67]So knowledge of... Now we know.
[106:25.21]You know a lot more than you... Yeah.
[106:27.87]You know the husband?
[106:29.59]Sure I know, Jacob.
[106:31.41]He was in the Corps.
[106:32.97]He met Selene on a furlough and married her when the war was finished.
[106:37.00]He put up with a load of shit.
[106:40.88]Do you think he killed his wife?
[106:42.84]No.
[106:44.22]No, not in my opinion.
[106:47.56]Alright, this guy has got... Alright, that was very clear.
[106:52.04]That was very clear.
[106:53.14]I do know.
[106:55.44]Oh, no.
[106:56.02]No, no, no, no, no.
[106:57.20]I don't think so.
[106:58.69]So if it wasn't Jacob, then you probably let her out of here with the guy who killed her.
[107:02.13]How do you feel about that?
[107:03.77]Stow the attitude, will you?
[107:05.37]No, maybe not.
[107:06.19]I tried to get on to Jacob.
[107:08.39]I rang him up, asked him to come pick her up like usual.
[107:12.42]But he refused.
[107:16.10]She picked some night to push him over the edge.
[107:19.18]I rang him back around 1130, but got no answer.
[107:24.73]One out of four again?
[107:25.81]Thanks, Mr. McCall.
[107:26.55]Oh, it's going to be three out of three, correct.
[107:28.59]Would you have an address for Selene?
[107:31.25]One out of three, zero, correct.
[107:35.45]God knows I had to send her home in enough cabs to remember that.
[107:38.32]Alright, we're going to investigate her residence.
[107:46.50]I see a telephone.
[107:47.94]Call it in.
[107:51.46]Let's get out of here.
[107:53.41]Can I use your phone?
[107:53.95]Hey, what's the hurry?
[107:54.79]My stool was just starting to warm up nicely.
[107:57.09]What is this?
[107:58.67]Coke Jacks.
[107:59.11]This doesn't pertain to the case.
[108:02.41]Sir, can you put that down?
[108:05.17]Where's your telephone?
[108:06.43]Do I need permission?
[108:14.09]Operator, give me dispatch.
[108:18.93]Putting you through now.
[108:22.20]Cole Phelps, batch 1247.
[108:25.96]I got a code for... How can I help, detective?
[108:29.74]I need a registered owner on a license plate, 2-boy-8899.
[108:33.98]Yes, detective.
[108:35.20]I'll need to contact the DMV.
[108:36.84]Shall I relay the details via KGPL?
[108:40.81]Please.
[108:42.25]Thanks, ma'am.
[108:45.97]Okay, let's go.
[108:47.15]Is there anything else I need to do in here?
[108:49.15]Waitress, can I have another spoon?
[108:52.11]Another spoon?
[108:55.52]Is the guy eating a candle?
[109:02.00]I just love the waxy part.
[109:04.60]Um, okay, I think we just leave.
[109:06.88]Get some air in here, man.
[109:10.71]Where's my partner?
[109:15.27]Where's my- Oh, he's in the car already.
[109:16.69]Wow.
[109:24.28]Let's go to the Anri residence.
[109:30.13]Don't do any cookies about it.
[109:32.77]Just go this way.
[109:35.05]You find the booze helps you get through a working day?
[109:37.67]Sharpens my investigatory instincts, Phelps.
[109:40.77]A smart lawyer might use that to throw out anything you collect today.
[109:44.33]A smart man might know it's unwise to stand between the patient and his medicine.
[109:49.10]As long as you're not falling over, Rusty, I'll let it slide.
[109:52.56]That's mighty kind of you, Phelps.
[109:55.00]You know, you picked the wrong job.
[109:56.40]Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[109:57.62]Hope you're having a good Saturday afternoon.
[109:59.10]We owe it to this city to do the best we can in this position.
[110:02.00]As homicide detectives, that responsibility is all the more serious.
[110:05.00]What is today?
[110:05.60]No, don't tell me.
[110:06.22]Let me guess.
[110:07.30]It's not political.
[110:08.32]It's practical.
[110:09.50]Maybe the men combing Hollywood Boulevard... It was Thursday two days ago, yesterday.
[110:14.53]So today is Thursday.
[110:16.93]I think today is Friday.
[110:19.19]I don't know.
[110:20.27]Betty's sure to be alive.
[110:21.73]The Japs would have spared Pearl Harbor.
[110:24.13]Our ancestors wouldn't have tasted the forbidden fruit.
[110:26.41]It's Thursday.
[110:26.89]Minor syntactical error, Detective Galloway.
[110:31.35]Whoa there.
[110:34.72]Guys, I'm on Pacific time, so it's different for me.
[110:36.54]I'm like a whole day behind you.
[110:37.74]Minor syntactical error, Detective Galloway.
[110:40.28]I never claimed to be able to prevent crimes.
[110:42.86]I only suggested a proficiency in solving them.
[110:46.24]Guess that's the drink slowing you down.
[110:48.32]Oh, my God.
[110:49.36]Brother, oh, brother.
[110:50.98]It's worse than I could ever imagine.
[110:52.55]Three hours equals a whole day.
[110:53.75]I know.
[110:55.79]You thought Nevada was mountain time?
[110:57.21]It is Pacific time, because it sits right there on the edge, on the bottom tail part, right next to California.
[111:05.19]In fact, driving from Las Vegas to Los Angeles takes about three and a half hours.
[111:12.65]That guy's going to explode.
[111:16.31]I didn't do it.
[111:17.14]We got a code four.
[111:20.98]What's your code?
[111:22.76]We got another code four.
[111:27.34]See?
[111:29.64]That's what I have to say.
[111:30.92]Maybe I would drive better.
[111:40.44]Yeah, I'm gonna get another code 4 here.
[111:42.01]I'm currently sitting inside of a car about to explode.
[111:45.23]Just might as well call it in and get it ready.
[111:47.89]And, uh, have a... That's when it cut out, because the car exploded.
[111:54.53]Hello?
[111:55.29]Who's here?
[111:55.93]Hello?
[112:16.98]I can't just go to the front door?
[112:21.29]Was that the back door?
[112:22.13]I have to look in the... I have to go in the front door?
[112:29.79]Alright, come on, that's a weird front door.
[112:33.63]It is.
[112:35.33]What is this door?
[112:36.57]I've never seen a house with a door wedged into the side like that.
[112:39.83]I'll try the back door.
[112:41.05]Wait here a second.
[112:41.75]That's what I just did.
[112:43.51]So I was already one step ahead of you.
[112:56.96]I thought he was gonna elbow the glass.
[113:07.85]Hmm.
[113:09.17]Hmm.
[113:10.95]Hmm.
[113:11.77]Hmm.
[113:13.29]This game would be more immersive if, like, every three or four seconds he went... Hmm.
[113:17.15]And there's no way to turn it off.
[113:22.33]Hmm.
[113:25.05]Hmm.
[113:29.30]Oh, here's another family burnt to death.
[113:33.70]Well, cops say house fire deaths are suspicious.
[113:36.80]What?
[113:38.96]Okay.
[113:42.84]Hmm.
[113:48.10]You said I had to go back, Doctor.
[113:51.28]The fires are cathartic.
[113:53.74]They allow you to confront your past.
[113:56.52]You said the house would be empty.
[113:58.82]Are you taking the medication I have prescribed?
[114:02.34]You said the house would be empty.
[114:05.06]I heard them screaming.
[114:07.50]Circumstances were unfortunate.
[114:10.40]My colleagues had made all the necessary arrangements.
[114:13.13]You said the house would be empty.
[114:15.31]You're killing me!
[114:16.83]The deaths were unfortunate.
[114:19.51]But you have dealt with death before.
[114:24.40]You said the house would be empty.
[114:26.38]How can I find peas?
[114:36.12]That's the weirdest wrong number I've ever had.
[114:48.35]Okay.
[114:49.69]Let's start checking.
[114:55.95]Come on, give me some clicks.
[114:58.01]Give me some clicks.
[115:03.08]Goggles!
[115:03.74]It would take a smarter man than me to connect that.
[115:06.24]Aww.
[115:09.64]Oh, I heard a chime.
[115:16.79]I don't think that's right, though.
[115:19.03]No?
[115:19.33]Where?
[115:22.15]They have all these audio cues in the game, and then they play a bunch of other ones.
[115:28.60]This isn't what we're looking for.
[115:30.06]That's a key, though.
[115:31.04]Can at least test to see where it goes to.
[115:33.50]Fireplace.
[115:35.52]Mirror.
[115:36.20]He's definitely filming somebody from the other side of this wall.
[115:43.75]We're going to go corner to corner here.
[115:45.47]Start in the front door.
[115:52.06]The burglar used the pry bar.
[115:53.92]Why did you kick the door in?
[115:55.70]You think I'm gonna climb through a broken window in a $30 suit?
[115:59.08]You got another thing coming, buster.
[116:01.86]That's true.
[116:05.40]Because as we all know, with inflation, that's like five grand.
[116:12.36]Everybody drinks the same alcohol.
[116:20.13]No good to me.
[116:26.71]Yeah, like, just one small complaint is, like, I wish, like, it's 30 bucks back then, but, like, it's fucking 2006.
[116:34.91]Just make it, like, what it would be, actually.
[116:36.52]Like, the cost would be, like, you know, 1,500 bucks is, like, a really expensive suit.
[116:40.28]Fucking irritating, you know?
[116:42.34]If you're so abrupt, you can find me at apartment 2.
[116:48.58]Okay.
[116:50.13]Okay.
[116:51.96]That's when the game came out.
[116:53.14]Hold on.
[116:53.44]Nothing?
[116:53.70]Is that it?
[117:25.94]No, it's not.
[117:30.88]You gotta wait till you hear that... the little twinkle.
[117:37.90]See, the goggles were important!
[117:40.71]A regular Amelia Earhart in her day.
[117:44.03]The ring looks distinctive.
[117:47.05]That's the ring.
[117:52.89]Speaking of rings...
[117:55.78]This is a ring.
[117:57.70]Well, actually, I don't know.
[117:59.24]This could be a couple of different things, though.
[118:02.67]No, never mind.
[118:05.11]This is a seed container.
[118:07.69]You can tell because of how deep it is.
[118:09.41]What about this?
[118:20.97]Hmm.
[118:21.19]I don't think this is any use to us.
[118:27.72]And that's it.
[118:29.76]Congratulations.
[118:30.52]Now I have to go to the neighbor.
[118:34.73]Is that as simple as walking next door?
[118:36.43]Do I have to drive there?
[118:37.53]Wait, what was that twinkle?
[118:40.67]See?
[118:40.89]No, it's the newspaper.
[118:44.35]Never mind.
[118:48.55]A pretentious streamer references himself.
[118:50.59]Only thing still important to him.
[118:52.25]What the fuck?
[118:54.35]Which neighbor is it?
[119:01.14]There's a bunch of neighbors.
[119:02.64]This house, this one?
[119:04.54]Oh, there's a neighbor.
[119:08.98]Hey.
[119:10.06]I knew it wasn't safe around here anymore.
[119:12.35]Are you the neighbor?
[119:16.07]LAPD.
[119:16.79]I guess you're the neighbor.
[119:19.13]Horgan.
[119:20.09]Jennifer Horgan.
[119:21.95]I've known Celine for more than ten years.
[119:24.03]Our children grew up together.
[119:25.98]What's going on, officer?
[119:27.37]Did you see Mrs. Henry go out last night?
[119:29.41]Well, I'm no busybody, you understand, but Celine had been drinking, and she and poor, long-suffering Jacob had a terrible row.
[119:39.88]What's a row?
[119:40.16]I think Jacob may have given her a black eye.
[119:42.51]He stormed out and she went back inside.
[119:44.65]Did he come back?
[119:45.65]No.
[119:46.63]Celine was listening to music and shouting until she left around 10 p.m.
[119:51.08]She was very drunk to have been driving.
[119:53.82]But she is not the sort of person you can stop from doing something when her dander is up.
[119:58.18]Where's my hat?
[119:58.62]What is this about, officer?
[119:59.94]Is Celine alright?
[120:01.59]I'm afraid Mrs. Henry has been murdered, ma'am.
[120:04.55]Murdered?
[120:07.27]Oh, my God.
[120:10.73]I'm afraid I need to go and then sit down.
[120:13.02]Alright, make sure you lock your door, too, because the murderer said he was coming here to kill you next.
[120:22.83]Imagine that was an option.
[120:27.28]Have a good day!
[120:35.75]Let's see what Jacob has to say for himself.
[120:37.61]I don't think Jacob is our man, but we should see what he has to say.
[120:40.21]Alright.
[120:40.39]How do you start using these?
[120:46.55]I have these free points.
[120:51.17]Jacob Henry, the husband.
[120:52.05]Estranged husband.
[120:56.33]Jacob Henry had a violent argument with his wife last night.
[120:59.55]He's looking more and more like a row.
[121:01.78]In my mind, if the Rod keeps the house looking like that, he probably deserved it.
[121:06.86]Skipper says bring him in.
[121:08.62]Keep the hatch open back for a while.
[121:10.76]Fine by me.
[121:11.48]So it ain't the werewolf killer after all.
[121:14.10]To every opening from Mission Impossible movies.
[121:16.62]I always said work the evidence.
[121:18.53]I only stipulated a connection to the BD killer as an avenue of investigation we should leave open.
[121:23.83]And as far as I'm concerned, it still is.
[121:25.69]And then eventually this is going to go...
[121:35.49]There's gonna be an elaborate intro.
[121:56.08]Look, just get out of the car.
[121:58.00]Climb over the fence.
[121:59.48]Like a real gamer.
[122:06.43]You can handle that one, but you can't handle this one.
[122:12.32]Whoa!
[122:13.80]Okay.
[122:14.78]It's right here.
[122:15.34]Yeah.
[122:31.63]Who's asking?
[122:32.75]LAPD.
[122:34.01]You're under arrest for the murder of your wife, Celine Henry.
[122:36.64]Murder?
[122:38.50]Celine?
[122:39.48]Save the dramatics for RKO, pal.
[122:41.62]You got bigger problems.
[122:44.46]What the hell are you talking about?
[122:45.96]You come in here, you tell me that Celine is... Take a seat, Mr. Henry.
[122:51.00]We're going to have a look around.
[122:52.34]Then we'll talk.
[122:53.88]Jesus.
[122:55.28]I'm sorry.
[122:55.92]I...
[123:02.02]Okay, more.
[123:03.22]Let's see what else we got.
[123:04.66]Don't talk.
[123:05.18]Okay.
[123:08.04]Living room, living room.
[123:15.86]We got a lot of boxes in here.
[123:17.06]Fan.
[123:25.23]I don't know what you're cooling here.
[123:28.17]It's pointed directly pretty much at the... You put that in the living room, man.
[123:33.31]That's stupid.
[123:35.83]Hmm.
[123:37.35]What goes in there?
[123:38.43]Something in there.
[123:41.85]Like, probably toothpicks or something.
[123:43.11]Someone's trying to run away real quick.
[123:59.62]Size 11.
[124:02.74]Why are you trying to run away?
[124:13.79]Chickens?
[124:24.17]Move the pencil.
[124:29.07]Shade in area?
[124:32.91]What the hell?
[124:33.63]What am I doing?
[124:38.13]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[124:40.54]This guy wrote, like, something in invisible ink.
[124:46.76]Thanks.
[124:50.67]Thanks for the offer.
[124:52.63]Need you to do something about my wife.
[124:56.77]Okay.
[124:57.71]Thanks for the offer.
[124:58.35]Need you to do something about my wife.
[125:04.75]Why would you write that in silly ink?
[125:07.51]Well, we got you.
[125:10.03]You're fucked now, man.
[125:14.15]Alright.
[125:14.63]Should we go right to that?
[125:15.58]I mean, you did... It's like, we could go right to, like, silly ink.
[125:23.80]So who could have killed Selene?
[125:24.94]Where did she go last night, Jacob?
[125:28.14]A bar, I suppose.
[125:31.17]Look, I don't know.
[125:37.68]Writing on... Hold on a minute.
[125:41.95]Lipstick markings on body reveal... Fuck you.
[125:45.49]One force.
[125:46.39]Missing jewelry.
[125:47.87]Size 8 shoes.
[125:50.67]Wait, he has size 11 though.
[126:01.18]Club owner McCall reports telephoning J.P.
[126:02.82]Herman Peely on night of murder.
[126:05.06]Oh.
[126:06.56]Forced entry.
[126:09.05]size 11 men's shoot to match the victim's injuries well hold on he put he put on different feet what about his alibi
[126:26.67]You know where she went, Jacob.
[126:28.23]You're lying.
[126:28.91]Why would I help you if you keep lying to me?
[126:31.53]Look, I'm telling you, I don't know.
[126:35.31]Well, he got a phone call, right?
[126:39.21]Hold on.
[126:41.35]You have different shoes!
[126:43.43]Club owner McCall reports telephoning Jacob Henry repeatedly on night of murder.
[126:52.24]But there's no cell phones!
[126:59.03]He didn't pick up.
[127:04.03]But he wouldn't be able to see that we missed calls.
[127:06.87]We know she went to the Baba Club.
[127:11.43]The bartender there.
[127:12.39]Alright, got him.
[127:14.58]He calls me if things are getting out of hand and I go and I bring her home.
[127:20.08]He called me last night.
[127:23.08]I said no.
[127:23.62]Phone rang a couple more times after that.
[127:29.59]I ignored it.
[127:30.65]His feet grew.
[127:31.53]Alright, I'm going to pay attention.
[127:34.67]I'm going to have to live with that.
[127:42.91]Last contact with the victim.
[127:47.02]When did you last see your wife, Mr. Henry?
[127:50.60]Last night.
[127:52.66]I went to see her.
[127:53.46]We talked.
[127:54.48]Things got a little out of hand.
[127:58.28]I left.
[128:02.94]I think that's true.
[128:03.74]Hold on.
[128:07.91]Sir, can I take a look at the bottoms of your feet?
[128:24.63]I don't know.
[128:25.97]I would say that he's telling the truth, but...
[128:34.03]Isn't that what- is that- that's like what the- yeah.
[128:36.95]This is a good cop.
[128:45.66]No, wait, they fucking- yeah, they did fight.
[128:47.28]They fought.
[128:47.90]You tailed her, watched her come out of a bar, and then beat her to death.
[128:51.52]Admit it, Henry.
[128:54.16]They did get in a fight.
[128:55.28]The neighbor said that.
[128:55.74]Why would I do that, detective?
[128:59.76]Because the neighbor said that you would, you, that is why.
[129:06.13]My wife was a drunk.
[129:09.81]It was a sickness with her.
[129:11.93]Doesn't mean I didn't love her.
[129:15.19]Would you stop loving your wife if she was unwell?
[129:18.66]No, I wouldn't.
[129:22.02]Motive for murder.
[129:29.74]Why did you kill her, Jacob?
[129:31.74]Why did you kill her?
[129:33.81]That's a lousy thing to say.
[129:36.47]I never gave up on my wife.
[129:47.23]Look at his eyes, though.
[129:47.95]They're darting around all over the place.
[129:52.57]So he did the fucking mystery ink.
[130:02.30]I don't believe you, Jacob.
[130:03.76]I think you didn't have the guts to do it yourself, so you had someone else do it.
[130:06.54]But did he write it?
[130:07.81]You want to back that up with something, big mouth?
[130:10.31]Huh?
[130:11.01]Yeah.
[130:11.55]I have a mystery ink here.
[130:16.43]Impression from note written by Jacob Henry concerning wife.
[130:18.59]There it is.
[130:19.53]You're done.
[130:19.87]The note by the phone suggests you meant her harm.
[130:23.22]You want the truth?
[130:25.28]Truth is I was sick to death of her.
[130:29.46]I was trying to have her committed.
[130:33.20]We're still going to need you to come downtown, Mr. Henry.
[130:35.08]How many points was that?
[130:36.42]We can get this all down on paper, Jacob.
[130:38.69]How you got fed up with your wife and how you figured killing her would bury all your troubles.
[130:43.55]Kill my own wife?
[130:45.03]She was a loss and a trap and you just couldn't stand it anymore.
[130:48.27]Shut your goddamn mouth.
[130:50.63]So now you're going to tell me you loved her?
[130:52.90]Ah, the DA goes all gooey over remorse, Jacob.
[130:56.92]Now you assaulted him.
[130:57.88]Okay, here we go.
[130:59.98]Here's the problem though.
[131:00.76]I haven't played in a long time.
[131:01.60]I forget how to punch.
[131:02.75]How do you punch?
[131:03.39]Is it R2?
[131:04.43]How do you punch?
[131:06.13]I haven't done this in like a month.
[131:07.65]What's punch?
[131:08.35]What's punch?
[131:11.17]I'm hitting every single button.
[131:16.39]A square.
[131:16.85]This doesn't look good for you, Jacob.
[131:27.02]I seriously don't know what it is.
[131:30.87]Okay, it's X. It's L2 and X. It's unfailable by the way, so that's good.
[131:43.26]That was a month ago when I heard the special from restaurant guys.
[131:47.35]L2 and X and square.
[131:48.83]Okay.
[131:49.43]Use his phone.
[132:04.00]Where's his phone?
[132:05.48]Trash, where's your phone?
[132:10.83]Operator, message for KGPL.
[132:14.67]Putting you through now.
[132:18.15]Phelps, badge 1247.
[132:21.86]How can I help, detective?
[132:24.42]I need a patrol unit to transport a suspect back to Central.
[132:28.60]Certainly, detective.
[132:31.02]You have a message from the coroner.
[132:32.52]Do you wish to be put through?
[132:35.17]Yes, ma'am.
[132:36.79]Carruthers.
[132:38.27]It's Phelps.
[132:39.77]I've completed the autopsy.
[132:41.47]Several wounds to the head from a blunt metal instrument.
[132:44.19]Wounds?
[132:44.61]Closest match would be a socket wrench handle.
[132:47.67]So the cause of death was the blunt?
[132:49.29]No, the blows to the head, surprisingly, were not fatal.
[132:52.97]Death was from hemorrhage and shock from the fractured ribs and multiple injuries caused by the stomping.
[132:58.80]Anything else?
[133:00.48]He's some kind of sex fiend.
[133:02.54]Sex fiend?
[133:03.40]Jesus.
[133:06.22]Why is everybody such a fucking sex fiend?
[133:09.65]Thanks, Doc.
[133:11.57]Operator, give me R&I.
[133:13.51]Jesus.
[133:15.59]Any word on an owner for that vehicle?
[133:17.31]License was 2-boy-8899.
[133:21.08]Yes, Detective.
[133:22.62]The plate belongs to a brown 1936 Pontiac.
[133:26.20]Registered owner is 1 Alonzo Mendez of 402 South Fremont Street, apartment 16.
[133:33.32]Thanks.
[133:36.27]Any other messages?
[133:38.65]One, detective.
[133:40.49]From Captain Donnelly.
[133:41.99]He wants any and all suspects returned to Central.
[133:44.83]Interviews to be set up immediately.
[133:47.19]Got it.
[133:47.55]We're coming in.
[133:48.23]This is Greg.
[133:50.29]Let me tell you something.
[133:51.41]You know when you had a school project where you had to have an older female voice?
[133:55.67]Like if you're making a video with your friends or something and you have your mother do a recording?
[134:01.47]Anybody else do that?
[134:02.29]That was your mom helping you do the English video project.
[134:07.49]Did anybody ever do, like, a video project for, like, school?
[134:11.31]None of you did?
[134:17.03]Or, like, for, like, a play or something, you need, like, an older woman's voice.
[134:20.47]And that was, like, one of the teachers would just record, like, a sentence for you guys.
[134:23.43]No one did that.
[134:25.33]Nice fucking kids these days.
[134:28.59]Didn't even record your mother, like, saying weird sentences for, like, your school project.
[134:39.74]Alright.
[134:40.36]Where are we going?
[134:43.52]Here.
[134:46.40]Alonzo Mendez.
[134:48.10]Sound like a man who moonlights as the werewolf.
[134:50.56]Don't sound like a man I'd let my daughter anywhere near.
[134:53.35]You've got a daughter.
[134:54.15]How old are you?
[134:55.73]You guys know how old I am.
[134:57.91]Kids these days.
[135:04.45]Been enough time drinking, Cole.
[135:05.89]You'll find yourself with any number of things you don't want when you're sober.
[135:09.45]So that's why you never sobered.
[135:11.55]Exactly.
[135:14.85]Do you have the VOD of your mother doing that?
[135:17.41]No.
[135:18.53]I'd use a payphone, guys.
[135:20.75]I used to call my parents collect.
[135:23.46]Because I got detention.
[135:25.10]I needed to tell them that they had to come and get me later.
[135:30.60]They know exactly what they're going to get.
[135:47.95]Alright.
[135:48.35]This is the apartment.
[135:50.26]Wait, why was it... I got a little twinkle here.
[135:52.10]Hold on.
[135:54.22]Sixteen.
[135:55.14]Mendez.
[135:55.86]Apartment 16.
[135:59.71]Why was I a bad kid?
[136:00.75]I mean, bad kid.
[136:06.43]Detention didn't mean you were a bad kid.
[136:08.09]Detention means that you had a teacher that didn't like the fact that you would take your sneakers off in class and juggle them while they were trying to do a lesson.
[136:18.54]You know, like, shut up, teacher.
[136:29.57]Here, the apartment's up on the top floor.
[136:36.39]I mean, it's not like one time I hid in the closet in my history class.
[136:44.38]And stayed in there for probably five full minutes while the teacher was starting the class.
[136:51.28]And then I just fucking bursted out and fell down on the floor.
[136:56.10]That actually happened.
[137:00.65]Alright, where are we going?
[137:04.29]Sixteen.
[137:14.49]No elevator here?
[137:21.93]Ugh, I've always wanted to do that.
[137:27.92]Oh, more notepad stuff.
[137:29.28]Any more invisible ink?
[137:33.02]Elevators didn't exist in these times.
[137:34.62]Yes, they did.
[137:35.10]I just took one.
[137:38.04]Don't lie to the streamer.
[137:39.06]Don't lie to me.
[137:42.38]I doubt it.
[137:55.44]Doesn't look like anything.
[137:59.68]G. I'm sorry.
[138:13.32]Somebody said fear.
[138:14.36]Fear.
[138:27.22]Fuck cursive, man.
[138:29.58]Probably nothing.
[138:39.16]What else is in here?
[138:41.05]Record player... books.
[138:45.05]Oh wait, I'm not done with this.
[138:46.37]That's the only door I'm allowed to kick down, isn't it?
[138:48.07]What does it want me to do?
[138:54.41]Cigarettes?
[138:56.31]Did I miss anything else?
[139:05.74]What about over here?
[139:08.40]What is this weird?
[139:09.98]What's with this weird room?
[139:11.96]This apartment is very strange.
[139:15.93]This is a weird apartment, man.
[139:17.65]Apartments aren't like this.
[139:23.95]Okay, so we have some clothes on the ground.
[139:26.79]We've got a dresser.
[139:30.09]And then a painting set.
[139:33.27]None of that looks important.
[139:36.42]Um... A toy.
[139:38.18]No, this room's clean.
[139:44.77]A shoe?! !
[139:47.10]We got him.
[139:47.48]Size 8.
[139:47.68]This dude was there.
[139:48.14]Found the killer.
[139:48.98]Don't even need to... This is like the fake crime.
[139:50.12]Mm-hmm.
[139:50.26]And this looks like some lipstick, doesn't it?
[140:18.82]same one same brand brothers could match the color and brand of the body well we have the murder weapon we better get pinker down here why keep it why not throw it away I think these clowns are geniuses thank your stars you caught a break captain Donald begin to like you hey what gives lapd you're under arrest
[140:49.07]Do not lose that son of a bitch!
[140:50.79]Stay right there!
[140:53.95]Mendez, stop right there!
[140:55.25]I just need to look at your feet!
[140:58.79]That's all I need to do!
[141:05.81]Can I Dark Souls him?
[141:10.40]You don't need to do this, Alonzo!
[141:26.81]Ow!
[141:29.85]He's gonna get away!
[141:30.65]No, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it!
[141:37.59]I had an opportunity and I... see?
[141:44.04]I could have driven right into the gas station.
[141:48.90]But I didn't.
[141:49.32]Where the fuck are you going, man?
[141:58.68]Okay.
[142:02.83]Come on!
[142:21.76]Get it?
[142:22.88]Got it.
[142:25.18]Well, now what do we do?
[142:27.86]He's in there.
[142:28.74]Get him out of there.
[142:29.42]What?
[142:31.62]Get him out.
[142:32.48]You don't need to shoot his tires anymore.
[142:33.90]This thing's going to blow up?
[142:45.65]Is that it?
[142:46.61]Did I beat him?
[142:47.73]Did I win?
[142:58.84]I ain't seeing a goddamn thing.
[143:05.64]And justice has been served.
[143:10.87]You did a grand job, lads.
[143:13.37]Phelps, that's quite a way to acquit yourself in your first outing as a homicide investigator.
[143:19.67]It seems this city has a new and vengeful guardian.
[143:23.67]Considering the evidence against your suspect and the thoroughness with which your report was compiled, I foresee a safe passage through the courts, and the DA agrees with me.
[143:33.40]Brutality on a scale such as this deserves retribution.
[143:37.66]The people and the press of this city demand it.
[143:47.03]Ooh, that was awkward.
[143:50.39]I did all the work, though.
[143:55.90]So how was our report there?
[143:56.80]18 and a... That was... Come on, that's pretty good.
[144:00.40]That's close enough.
[144:01.70]18 out of 19, 5 out of 6.
[144:03.22]I got one question wrong.
[144:08.08]I'm never gonna make any money, though.
[144:09.34]5,000... That's like... That's like... That's like, what?
[144:15.36]50, 60, $70,000?
[144:15.86]Do I have to make any money?
[144:27.01]That's only a B?
[144:29.25]What?
[144:29.43]That's fine.
[144:36.81]Good job, chumps.
[144:42.14]I have to pee, and I'm going to grab... I think I'm going to make like a juice or something.
[144:53.10]I'm like thirsty and...
[144:55.39]I'm burning up for you What do we got here?
[145:07.85]This game looks fun It is The Golden Butterfly The game is fun
[145:30.66]It's always a guy with a... ...plub.
[145:38.17]Galloway.
[145:41.72]Got it, Skipper.
[145:45.19]I think this is the nudity mission.
[145:46.81]Oh, we already saw the nudity mission.
[145:49.33]Unless there's a nudity mission after the nudity mission.
[145:53.74]In which case... That sounds awfully similar.
[146:02.69]The first rule of police work is make no assumptions until you've seen the evidence.
[146:06.31]Wait, are we breaking open like a serial killer case where... Okay, hold on a minute here.
[146:10.81]I think we're getting to the meat and potatoes of this whole game.
[146:12.50]I think I know the place where they found the lady.
[146:14.90]Somebody's a serial killer.
[146:16.38]Let's go.
[146:18.95]Alright, give me a second.
[146:20.35]Let me just grab... I'm craving something, you know what I mean?
[146:26.86]I'll be right back.
[146:27.98]I'm going to blend up some fruits, okay?
[146:31.12]I'll be back in like 40 minutes.
[146:32.78]I'm just kidding.
[146:34.12]Me just saying that probably made everybody leave.
[146:35.92]I'll be back in two minutes.
[146:38.57]Alright, be right back.
[151:00.72]Alright.
[151:01.22]I'm sorry.
[151:01.70]I had to make something.
[151:07.14]This one's even... See?
[151:08.34]Okay, that looks really fucking gross in this tiny camera.
[151:16.65]That looks like a blood-stained windshield.
[151:20.43]Hold on.
[151:24.92]It's fruits.
[151:25.68]It's blueberries, blackberries, raspberries.
[151:29.66]It's fruits, guys.
[151:34.27]And it gets, like, stuck in your teeth.
[151:35.61]It's the worst.
[151:37.31]Anyways, I don't have cameras on because I don't do cam.
[151:40.77]I don't do it.
[151:43.27]You understand?
[151:45.43]Guys, I don't do cam.
[151:50.66]You think the Vice boys get it?
[151:54.63]I thought that was a close-up of a tortilla.
[151:57.01]No, that was my face.
[151:59.01]That was my face.
[152:00.81]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[152:06.96]He's so insecure.
[152:08.08]No, I don't like... I don't like this.
[152:11.24]Let me just... Look.
[152:13.00]I don't like this.
[152:20.89]The reason why I don't like facecam is because, like, I'm just, like, here.
[152:25.93]Just sitting here.
[152:26.73]People just looking at my face.
[152:34.62]Just in case you were curious, I'm still here.
[152:36.50]I sure am adding a lot to this video footage here.
[152:39.14]Ahem.
[153:06.30]Where am I supposed to go?
[153:16.19]Up top.
[153:16.77]Okay, I fucked it up.
[153:17.53]You have to react more.
[153:21.47]Okay.
[153:34.72]Where am I fucking going?
[153:38.48]I have to go up.
[153:39.18]Get back in the car.
[153:39.92]We've got to go up and then right.
[153:59.76]Give us more reactions.
[154:06.81]calm down reaction I'll give you a reaction now boys boys you know as much as I do I'll be holding a press conference once the autopsy is being completed
[154:21.85]I have two of my finest investigators on the case fresh from bringing down the sword of justice on the crazed sex captain aren't there similarities between this murder and the murder of celine Henry and of Elizabeth short for that you don't believe there's a crazed sex killer at large boys boys be sensible we have the greatest police force in the world he's the guy he's the serial killer investigators alright let's play Red Dead I figured it out how can any killer continue to be that
[154:51.11]No.
[154:51.25]I'm still having fun playing this one.
[154:53.47]Why would I change games when I'm liking and playing this one?
[155:15.90]I got the same body type as him.
[155:17.78]That same side-like stomach profile.
[155:19.82]I know what it's like.
[155:21.16]You know when you have the same stomach profile?
[155:34.31]You were the first on scene.
[155:35.29]You.
[155:36.22]So what happened?
[155:37.06]Show's over.
[155:38.06]Keep moving, all of you.

[155:40.98]Which one of you?
[155:42.86]You.
[155:44.96]What did you do?
[155:46.58]What happened here?
[155:49.78]Who did it?
[155:51.12]Why is there a blip here?
[155:53.37]Why do you want me to... What do you think?
[156:02.95]Oh, god damn it.
[156:03.83]It's another fucking naked body.
[156:06.79]God... Is it like a... Can I...
[156:12.03]Similar emote.
[156:12.75]To what?
[156:13.61]The Dahlia?
[156:14.77]Shit.
[156:15.27]I don't think so.
[156:16.13]Celine Henry.
[156:17.01]That's a closed case.
[156:18.75]This is probably another sad sack who lost his temper with a brow he wouldn't put out.
[156:22.33]Is it naked bodies from here on out for real?
[156:24.09]Watch your mouth, Phelps.
[156:26.07]All I'm saying is we've got enough to do without reopening closed cases.
[156:29.54]Talk me through it, Mal.
[156:30.98]Severely battered, on display.
[156:33.44]Footprints would indicate that she has been stomped.
[156:36.22]Size of the footprints would seem to indicate a smallish men's shoe.
[156:39.84]What size shoe did Mendez wear?
[156:41.93]You finished?
[156:42.63]No, I'm not.
[156:44.19]At a glance, I would say strangulation is the cause of death.
[156:47.37]I'll need to do further tests for semen.
[156:50.33]Angry boyfriend.
[156:51.33]If they were married, they'd be at home, not humping out here in Lover's Lane.
[156:55.78]You mind if I examine the body?
[156:56.92]Be my guest.
[156:57.74]Oh, fucking goddammit.
[157:00.82]OK, whatever.
[157:10.49]Rope pattern.
[157:10.81]She looks like she was run over by a car or something.
[157:14.59]This is fucked up.
[157:15.29]Let's check that one.
[157:16.11]No, wrong.
[157:19.20]No, no, no.
[157:42.34]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[157:43.46]I don't want to be here any longer than I have to.
[157:45.76]Another wedding ring?
[157:47.64]Fourth finger, left hand.
[157:50.92]A wedding or engagement ring.
[157:52.60]Violently removed.
[157:53.32]This is the same thing as the other one.
[157:57.24]Am I, like, in Bizarro Land?
[157:58.40]Or are we doing the same one?
[158:03.83]The stopping angle in the Henry case.
[158:05.55]Was it reported in the press?
[158:06.73]Small men's footprint.
[158:07.87]Sure was.
[158:08.97]Every detail a copycat would want was there in the story.
[158:12.98]okay I think that's it anything else oh emote only mode emotes only
[158:37.46]Okay.
[158:38.92]There's so many seeds in this.
[158:41.30]Oh, we have a name.
[158:41.82]Can you run Deirdre Muller by RNI?
[158:43.88]This is why I don't like raspberries and blackberries.
[158:47.26]It's just full of seeds.
[158:49.41]And it's like you're just drinking popcorn kernels.
[158:52.35]I need to strain this shit.
[158:59.63]Is that it?
[159:00.13]Money?
[159:01.61]If the motive was robbery, why not take the money?
[159:09.07]That's it in here, right?
[159:10.11]Got a name.
[159:11.93]Cash.
[159:14.16]Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[159:16.02]What about not making assumptions and going on the evidence?
[159:18.06]Here we go.
[159:18.56]Small feat.
[159:40.83]Okay.
[159:42.74]How's that?
[159:46.86]It's not.
[159:47.44]It can't be Mendez, because Mendez had size 8.
[159:57.84]It's time to bring in a lineup.
[160:00.50]Only feet, though.
[160:16.70]Alright, so we're going to go to the Mahler residence.
[160:18.84]Residential address of murder victim Mahler.
[160:25.05]Okay, so.
[160:33.78]I got my small feet all over the crime scene.
[160:38.02]Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[160:46.13]I thought you were on our way to lock up the husband it doesn't work out that Deirdre Muller has suffered enough more than enough Oh
[161:06.10]She was a woman, wasn't she?
[161:08.35]Around about my third divorce, I realized women might not be the pure angels we imagined.
[161:13.73]You're married, ain't you, Phelps?
[161:15.35]Don't make any insinuations about my wife.
[161:16.89]She's not trying to get in the car.
[161:18.83]Hey, she's a woman.
[161:19.93]She's the mother of my children.
[161:21.69]Ha!
[161:22.27]You're a father, Cole?
[161:23.45]Then don't tell me your eye don't bend.
[161:26.58]This conversation is over.
[161:29.74]I can't... There's nowhere to go.
[161:32.30]I fucked this whole thing up.
[161:33.50]I could go this way.
[161:36.68]Why would you drive a car down here?
[161:41.37]Is there a jump I can go up to get out?
[161:42.95]There we go, out.
[161:48.43]That was a shortcut too.
[161:58.66]Okay, what kind of music do we have this time?
[162:01.84]Oh, I know what we've got.
[162:02.60]We've got the romantic comedy, the love interest shows up in the bar where the two comedy guys are hanging out.
[162:08.27]And it's slow motion zooms in to her walking around and potentially looking in our direction.
[162:29.05]Eat your berry puree.
[162:31.91]I will enjoy my baby food.
[162:34.05]Thank you very much.
[162:34.87]Give me a break.
[162:39.92]Vehicle damage.
[162:40.72]I can't help it.
[162:49.27]No, Jeremy.
[162:50.21]This is a different... No, this is... I want it to be the romantic comedy love interest scene.
[162:56.29]Whatever your version in your head is, it's fine.
[163:08.35]Had to skip the Red Dead streams?
[163:09.68]Glad you're back.
[163:10.30]Hey, it's good to be back.
[163:12.22]I do, uh... I do understand that Red Dead is a brand new game, and on a lot of people's must-play lists.
[163:20.40]And I don't expect people to sit there the whole time.
[163:23.46]So, welcome back.
[163:24.50]Thank you.
[163:36.38]He was gone for a day.
[163:37.16]Well, that person was saying that they didn't watch my Red Dead streams because they didn't want to get spoiled.
[163:42.69]And I completely understand.
[163:45.11]Hope you enjoy the game when you play it.
[164:02.11]I didn't watch the Red Dead streams because they suck.
[164:04.29]Phelps and Galloway.
[164:05.71]What?
[164:05.83]LAPD.
[164:07.42]Is your father home?
[164:08.44]What are you... Are you home soon?
[164:10.14]This was so much fun.
[164:11.58]What are you talking about?
[164:12.62]What's your name?
[164:13.10]I had so much fun on those streams.
[164:14.88]Eloise Mahler?
[164:17.14]Can we come in?
[164:17.98]What kind of baby food are you drinking right now?
[164:22.94]Thank you.
[164:25.38]Could you have a seat for me, Michelle?
[164:37.50]We're gonna have a look around.
[164:39.18]He's getting high on baby food.
[164:43.29]He'll be back in a moment.
[164:44.49]Just sit tight.
[164:46.41]Why do I always read the worst feedback?
[164:50.55]Because that's just the... Cookies!
[164:53.97]Cookies.
[164:54.45]What was it?
[164:55.23]What was the joke?
[164:56.03]Come on.
[164:56.67]What was it?
[164:57.03]My partner will explain everything.
[165:01.32]I forget.
[165:01.64]I don't remember.
[165:02.20]Something about a restaurant?
[165:03.74]Something about ordering from the special?
[165:05.26]And then it was the cookies or something?
[165:06.44]What was it?
[165:10.09]I don't know.
[165:17.74]It's a Cabot.
[165:21.80]We've got a Cabot.
[165:23.00]And we also have... We'll put down that.
[165:30.99]Lemon.
[165:31.37]Cabot.
[165:32.61]Cabot.
[165:34.25]I can do that better.
[165:35.51]There's a lemon on the table.
[165:36.33]There's also a cap.
[165:38.37]I can't do it anymore.
[165:39.99]Too old.
[165:42.36]I'm trying to have my jaw, like, snap up.
[165:45.62]This isn't what we're looking for.
[165:50.74]I got a mouthful of baby food.
[165:52.20]Whatever.
[165:55.90]Turn on the webcam.
[165:56.76]That's why it's not on.
[166:00.27]Half of these things are so fucking embarrassing.
[166:03.18]Times 10 if the webcam was on.
[166:05.68]Don't forget somebody's birthday.
[166:11.61]But I told you, I would be doing this shit.
[166:13.03]I'd be saying like, the cabots.
[166:15.83]If the stream was off.
[166:21.40]I'll give you a real story here.
[166:22.40]So after I watched Infinity War, me and Kim watched it.
[166:27.78]And I didn't even know, I had no idea.
[166:30.52]Kim walked in.
[166:32.47]I was just sitting there on the computer.
[166:34.35]And she's like, will you please stop?
[166:36.09]I was like, what are you talking about?
[166:38.11]What do you mean, please stop?
[166:39.23]She's like, you keep saying the same line.
[166:41.65]And I was just sitting up here going, I know what it's like to lose.
[166:46.89]To know so desperately that you were right.
[166:49.49]Like, I was doing it, like, over and over again.
[166:52.94]I was just doing it.
[166:53.50]Alright, we got a couple of seed boxes.
[167:02.85]No sign of a wedding ring.
[167:05.17]So, everyone that thinks me saying, like, oh, cabbage is like, no, I would be doing that.
[167:10.19]In fact, I would be doing it, like, 15 times more if I wasn't on camera.
[167:19.19]It's actually keeping me in check, being, like, recorded.
[167:24.12]Feet.
[167:29.98]Oh, these are only size 8s.
[167:32.20]Size 8s.
[167:41.90]Oh, yes, the killer did have feet.
[167:48.00]Well, why are we looking for, like... Well, no, we're looking for smaller.
[167:55.25]Cookies Cabot.
[168:01.87]Is this about Mommy?
[168:03.64]Daddy is trying to find her.
[168:05.74]He's telling me she's okay.
[168:07.18]Oh, this is not good.
[168:08.32]I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Michelle, but... Your mother is dead.
[168:18.80]Do you think you could answer a few questions for us?
[168:22.36]I could try.
[168:26.20]Oh, shit.
[168:27.06]Okay, hold on.
[168:28.92]Is this the dog?
[168:29.57]This is... I gotta be careful.
[168:32.97]Hold on.
[168:33.81]Some of your mother's jewelry was missing.
[168:35.79]Can you describe her things?
[168:38.15]Ring, watch.
[168:41.45]But why would she know those?
[168:42.29]I never paid much attention to that stuff.
[168:44.35]Well, she would just know that, right?
[168:49.05]I mean, I just asked her.
[168:52.81]I just asked her.
[168:53.55]I'm not going to bad cop her.
[168:55.59]She's a kid.
[168:56.33]She wore a wedding ring?
[168:57.81]And he chose it herself.
[169:00.51]A rose gold wedding band and a matching diamond and ruby engagement ring.
[169:05.43]She wore a watch?
[169:06.98]Yes.
[169:08.02]The yellow gold Elgin watch.
[169:10.36]Daddy bought it for her birthday.
[169:11.74]They had a fight.
[169:15.94]It was kind of a makeup present.
[169:18.61]okay last contact let me hold it wait let me see this first I don't want to this up alright there's a rope on the lady's neck missing watch and rings so they both she that maybe she took them I don't know small men are we sure that's a small men's footprint and not like a small woman's footprint do we know the make and bottle of that shoe
[169:47.94]I don't really have much to go on, so... When did you last see your mother?
[169:51.32]Yesterday afternoon.
[169:52.34]I went to a dance at Belmont High.
[169:55.62]Mommy was supposed to pick me up, but she didn't show.
[170:00.25]So what did you do then?
[170:01.55]I was upset.
[170:04.71]Daddy came instead.
[170:11.20]Okay.
[170:12.18]Why would she be lying about this?
[170:16.72]Do I have anything...
[170:22.24]And did he come and get you?
[170:23.34]Of course.
[170:26.94]Some boys offered me a ride home, but it's not the right thing to do.
[170:29.44]I don't sense a why here.
[170:30.51]So you were hanging around the school for quite a while.
[170:33.37]What happened with your father?
[170:34.91]I don't know.
[170:35.67]I called and called and finally he answered.
[170:40.49]He came straight away then.
[170:42.67]Uh-oh.
[170:44.84]We're getting rocky here.
[170:48.72]Your mom and dad are happily married?
[170:52.52]What are you saying?
[170:53.30]Of course they are.
[170:54.58]Oh, yeah?
[171:00.75]Why is Dad picking you up instead?
[171:04.55]They weren't happy, were they, Michelle?
[171:06.75]Did your father ever hit your mother?
[171:08.73]Just the once.
[171:10.20]Just the one.
[171:11.34]She said she would leave him if he ever did it again.
[171:13.34]He brought her a brooch pin to make up for it.
[171:18.62]And he always wore her golden butterfly.
[171:22.20]Thanks, Miss Muller.
[171:23.38]Two out of three?
[171:24.18]What was the third?
[171:25.20]What?
[171:27.80]Hold on, what was the third issue?
[171:30.64]Daddy, the police are here.
[171:33.60]I'll talk to the police.
[171:34.32]Daddy, Mommy is gone.
[171:35.87]She wasn't telling the truth on the one and the first one?
[171:37.55]She's not even out of school.
[171:38.75]You can't come in here interrogating her like she's some kind of... Your wife was found murdered this morning.
[171:43.75]Found?
[171:45.77]What the... But she only...
[171:52.98]We have some questions that we would like to ask you.
[171:55.88]Sure, yeah.
[171:57.20]Yeah, I'll do my best.
[171:58.36]Okay.
[172:00.54]Footprints at crime scene.
[172:05.75]What is that photo down there?
[172:08.41]That's a really odd photo.
[172:14.38]What size shoe do you wear, Mr. Muller?
[172:16.94]Why do you ask?
[172:18.86]It's routine, sir.
[172:19.78]Simple process of elimination.
[172:22.69]Nines, I think.
[172:26.69]Bullshit.
[172:27.25]You got eights in the bedroom.
[172:28.47]You got eights in the bedroom.
[172:30.89]He's got eights in the bedroom.
[172:32.99]He's got eights in the bedroom.
[172:42.00]That's funny.
[172:42.94]The work boots we found here are size eights.
[172:46.00]Why lie about it if you've got nothing to hide?
[172:48.22]Book them.
[172:48.82]Because I always get teased about the size of my feet.
[172:53.17]You know, small feet, small... Always been true in my experience.
[172:57.63]Small what?
[172:59.85]Small... Ego?
[173:11.06]Well, just to let you know, I wear a size 6.
[173:12.92]So, I mean... I wear a size 6 women's.
[173:18.04]No, I don't.
[173:32.83]I wear size 10.
[173:33.49]Oh, you want me to prove it on stream?
[173:40.35]You want me to go get my shoes?
[173:50.63]No, I'm not, excuse me.
[173:51.81]You phoned in a missing persons report this morning?
[173:55.46]Yeah, that's right.
[173:58.08]My wife didn't come home last night.
[173:59.28]She left around...
[174:01.87]She left around 9.30.
[174:04.40]Michelle was out at dance.
[174:05.40]She called me to let me know that Deidre didn't turn up.
[174:08.32]Oh, that's bullshit.
[174:10.54]Because your daughter had to call you, motherfucker.
[174:13.92]Gotcha!
[174:14.26]Your wife never goes by herself to bars, nightclubs?
[174:17.09]Motherfucker!
[174:19.23]What are you suggesting?
[174:20.17]You're suggesting my wife's loose?
[174:22.83]Now is not the time for you to be pushing me, mister.
[174:25.19]Your daughter said you were having an argument.
[174:27.33]We argued about who would pick up Michelle.
[174:31.49]I worked a full day.
[174:32.83]I wanted to come home, put my feet up.
[174:34.75]My size is eight feet, by the way.
[174:36.71]I'm not that small.
[174:37.31]Uh, alibi.
[174:37.51]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[174:47.00]Reports calling home repeatedly with no answer on the night of the murder.
[174:47.00]Okay, Wait, wait, wait, wait, oyoyoyoy okay.
[175:02.64]Yes, that's correct.
[175:06.43]Why didn't you answer the phone?
[175:13.23]Wait, right?
[175:13.83]Because... Yeah, nobody answered.
[175:19.48]So you didn't... Yeah, you're in deep shit.
[175:21.08]You should feel clean if you're having an affair.
[175:22.74]Or if there's something going on.
[175:25.26]I told you I was here when you said I wasn't.
[175:28.48]yeah because uh your daughter called you over and over again so why did you take so long to answer the phone when your daughter called okay I went out for a while I was I was driving around it's my way of relaxing movements of victim what the hell does that mean your wife went to pick up Michelle

[176:12.92]You got any theories?
[176:13.98]Because we're starting to like you for this.
[176:17.38]The car park by the school is kind of dark.
[176:20.34]Uh, maybe somebody jumped through there.
[176:21.86]Did you try the parking lot?
[176:26.00]History of violence.
[176:28.30]Your wife was beaten and then strangled.
[176:30.85]Daughter did say... No alibi.
[176:32.77]And history of violence towards your wife.
[176:35.45]That's not true, goddammit!
[176:38.63]Do I have any evidence of that, though?
[176:40.59]Can I say, your daughter told me?
[176:45.60]I can't say that you did that.

[177:31.40]Do I look like a Rockefeller?
[177:33.75]Nobody likes to cheapskate you.
[177:36.74]Thanks for chiming in.
[177:37.40]Getting hostile with us is a very bad idea, Hugo.
[177:40.26]I'm no murderer.
[177:41.54]Make some arrangements for your daughter and then present yourself to Central Station for questioning.
[177:45.49]You gotta be kidding me, Phelps.
[177:46.97]Put the cuffs on.
[177:47.65]Not good enough.
[177:48.25]This is an outrage.
[177:49.29]I didn't kill my wife.
[177:50.55]Your daughter is in the next room, Muller, so I'm giving you a break.
[177:53.41]Don't make me change my mind and don't make me come looking for you.
[178:03.38]We should go back in there and bust his ass.
[178:06.63]One, we need to break his alibi, check phone records, canvas the neighbors.
[178:10.08]Two, we have motive of domestic violence, which probably goes for half the men in LA.
[178:14.34]Three, we have no evidence tying him to the crime scene.
[178:18.52]Oh, I thought the NPC was waving.
[178:23.92]Why would we do this?
[178:29.32]Yes, ma'am.
[178:30.40]I heard the terrible news over the radio.
[178:32.70]I heard the terrible news through the window.
[178:34.60]Yes, sir.
[178:36.28]They had a row last night?
[178:37.76]Seed baby food.
[178:38.56]I heard Mrs. Muller screaming.
[178:40.18]Did you see Mrs. Muller come home late last night at all?
[178:42.70]No, not at all.
[178:45.20]I did see Mr. Muller put something in the incinerator earlier this morning, though.
[178:49.00]Well, there's a smoking gun right there.
[178:50.56]Let's get this bum downtown and into a cell.
[178:52.74]He's like incinerating his wife's body.
[178:54.23]Look, there he is now.
[178:56.41]There it is.
[178:57.09]There it is.
[178:57.58]He's incinerating.
[178:59.04]He's incinerating.
[179:01.00]Sir, what are you incinerating?
[179:05.02]What is it?
[179:06.24]What is it?
[179:06.98]It's a shoe!
[179:08.76]He's incinerating his shoes.
[179:16.76]No time for that.
[179:28.17]Can I get on the tricycle?
[179:31.71]Jay's asking him on the trike.
[179:48.20]Hands up.
[179:48.56]Turns out it was just like a turkey.
[180:03.96]No, you don't understand.
[180:05.08]I was trying to cook the shoes.
[180:06.10]Leather.
[180:06.46]It's beef.
[180:09.48]This doesn't look good, Hugo.
[180:12.53]I can explain the blood.
[180:15.97]Get him booked in at Central, officer.
[180:17.79]Then put him in an interview room.
[180:19.05]Where's the shoes?
[180:20.43]The shoes did it.
[180:21.64]Yes, sir, detective.
[180:23.85]Is there someone you can call, Miss?
[180:25.31]I don't... I don't want to go home and... You need somewhere to stay, Michelle.
[180:30.31]Do you have other family?
[180:32.15]Grandparents?
[180:32.97]Aunts or uncles?
[180:33.65]Call Aunt Helen, but she lives in Akersfield and... Call her.
[180:38.47]We're going to get someone down here from Juvenile Hall to talk to you in the meantime.
[180:42.85]Juvenile Hall?
[180:44.79]We ought to get some uniforms down here.
[180:46.29]Why are we sending her to Juvenile Hall?
[180:57.25]It would take a smarter man than me to connect that.
[181:11.83]Start playing the violin.
[181:13.11]Oh, that's evil.
[181:20.25]That's not, okay.
[181:22.57]Thank you for your assistance.
[181:23.90]Bye.

[181:40.13]At first I thought the phone wasn't connected.
[181:42.89]Phelps, 1247.
[181:47.69]How can I help, detective?
[181:50.01]I need an address on a Belmont High School.

[182:57.30]Are they trying to get to me?
[183:03.13]Why won't I pick up the radio?
[183:04.19]I won't pick the radio up.
[183:08.85]Sorry, I can't reach the radio.
[183:11.27]Uh-oh, he's gone rogue.
[183:16.64]I'm on my own time now.

[184:26.56]God damn it.
[184:27.72]Okay.
[184:29.68]Yeah!
[184:32.54]Nope.
[184:34.36]Alright.
[184:34.67]Okay.
[184:35.11]This is all seeds at the bottom.
[184:37.33]This is gonna be disgusting.
[184:38.83]Ugh.
[184:39.37]Who the hell is this?
[184:41.51]Why are we chasing this person?
[184:44.95]Watch out for the kids smoking weed under here!
[185:04.39]Or cigarettes.
[185:05.13]Either or.
[185:06.71]What?
[185:12.93]Okay.
[185:23.53]You.
[185:26.17]You.
[185:27.37]Oh, that one you.
[185:28.35]That one you.
[185:29.43]It's you.
[185:42.18]Quick.
[185:45.76]And he's slowing down, slowing down, slowing down.
[185:50.68]Just enough for me to get him.
[186:06.19]Scripted.
[186:09.41]Who is, who is this guy?
[186:14.31]11K, go ahead.
[186:17.19]11K, see the janitor.
[186:18.75]A green 1946 coupe registered to a Mrs. Hugo Moeller has been found in the parking lot adjoining the Belmont High School in Blainfield.
[186:27.62]11K, code 2.
[186:30.42]Oh.
[186:31.92]Really?
[186:32.20]What's your name?
[186:34.16]So we got him.
[186:36.30]Who's asking?
[186:38.36]We can do this the easy way or the hard way.
[186:41.44]Name's Eli Rooney.
[186:42.98]You've been in trouble with the law before, Eli?
[186:45.57]Some.
[186:46.45]What are you doing around here?
[186:47.83]I like to keep an eye on the children.
[186:49.69]Strictly paternal, is it, Eli?
[186:51.63]Don't sass me, boy.
[186:53.31]A woman was abducted here last night, Eli, and murdered.
[186:55.89]And I would love to make you for that, you low-key motherfucker.
[186:59.00]Well, I wouldn't know nothing about that.
[187:01.84]A woman, you say?
[187:03.89]I like them a little younger than that.
[187:05.49]Turn out your pockets, Eli.
[187:07.59]Why would I do that?
[187:08.89]Because I'm about to break your fucking skull, Eli.
[187:13.85]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[187:16.21]You're under arrest, Eli.
[187:18.07]You're in very deep trouble.
[187:19.21]It's a brooch.
[187:20.66]Get some backup down here, Rusty.
[187:22.20]We need to get this one downtown and into a cell.
[187:25.62]Okay.
[187:30.86]So wait, that means... Alright, so what about the other guy?
[187:38.83]What time did you see the person park the car?
[187:41.22]Late last night.
[187:42.52]After school social, maybe 1 a.m.
[187:44.22]I've been keeping a good eye out lately.
[187:46.50]We've had problems with the child molester.
[187:49.18]Eli Rooney.
[187:50.66]We've met.
[187:51.38]Filthy son of a bitch.
[187:52.70]Excuse me?
[187:53.54]He was here yesterday before the dance.
[187:55.40]Was it him you saw park the car?
[187:57.16]I don't know, sir.
[187:57.84]I'm not pressing any buttons.
[187:58.76]It's just going quick.
[187:59.28]I'd like to say yes, but the truth is it was pretty dark.
[188:02.22]Would you say Rooney is violent?
[188:04.33]Yes, sir.
[188:04.99]I would say so, yes.
[188:07.69]Thanks for your help.
[188:21.54]Oh, okay.
[188:27.73]Wow.
[188:29.77]This is the car?
[188:30.65]Yes, sir, detective.
[188:32.67]Have you looked it over?
[188:33.83]Superficially.
[188:35.99]I was told to wait for you guys.
[188:37.43]Bex, we'll take it from here.
[188:39.81]Okay.
[188:40.41]Well, I wonder what this stuff is for.
[188:44.06]Right.
[188:45.22]Blood and skin samples.
[188:46.50]We better get Ray Pinker out here.
[188:51.74]Just some bloody stuff.
[188:53.72]The overalls are stenciled HM.
[188:54.86]Muller is a mechanic.
[188:56.35]I wonder what Eli does for a living.
[189:07.65]Like... It's from a Chrysler.
[189:11.16]Could be important.
[189:12.36]Chrysler.
[189:13.08]Tire.
[189:13.90]Iron.
[189:20.14]Anybody have a phone?
[189:28.80]Well, no evidence in here.
[189:29.88]Time to call it a night.
[189:47.31]Phelps, batch 1247.
[189:52.61]I need interrogation set up at Central for both suspects being held in the Mueller homicide case.
[189:56.75]Oh, we gotta figure this shit out then.
[189:58.57]Certainly, detective.
[189:59.51]I'll get in touch with the watch commander.
[190:02.43]Thank you.
[190:06.61]Interrogation time.
[190:08.81]I'm not very good at these.
[190:09.93]Is there something wrong with this car?
[190:24.76]I guess so.
[190:28.99]Get out.
[190:29.61]I did not do that.
[190:47.82]I say we make Rooney for this.
[190:49.80]I think we should lay it on him.
[190:50.94]He was near the college.
[190:52.50]He had her jewelry.
[190:53.28]The DA will love him for it.
[190:55.20]Even if he didn't do it?
[190:56.86]Who cares whether he did it?
[190:58.64]You have kids, Phelps?
[191:00.40]He needs to be taken permanently out of harm's way.
[191:03.64]And we let Muller slide?
[191:05.66]For a while.
[191:06.84]He gets a free pass for now.
[191:11.43]I don't know about this.
[191:12.53]My gut says Muller.
[191:13.73]We caught him trying to destroy evidence in his backyard.
[191:16.38]And that was his car with the bloody tools in it.
[191:18.84]I never said it wasn't Muller.
[191:20.42]Hell, he probably killed his wife, deprived that poor kid of a mother.
[191:23.92]But he's not an immediate danger to anyone else.
[191:27.36]Rooney's a threat to every kid at Bell.
[191:30.74]He's a peeper, Rusty.
[191:31.72]We could pick him up for something else.
[191:33.14]You really want to run that risk?
[191:36.26]Why don't we just fuse them together and then try them at the same time?
[192:03.31]The court system is so backed up.
[192:09.02]Get him to like a lab mad scientist lair and like turn him into Goro.
[192:14.21]Epic gamer reference.
[192:19.81]Never mind.
[192:44.88]Massive ethical nightmare.
[192:46.30]Wow!
[193:04.88]Alright, let's go to the morgue and let's take a look at some clues and evidence Find out who's the bad guy Why is the morgue in elementary school
[193:33.87]Alright, what do we do with... Hey, that's not the morgue, Doctor.
[193:43.15]Viewing gallery?
[193:48.98]Staff only?
[193:51.25]I think he's any kind of doctor.
[193:52.89]Um...
[194:32.65]What am I doing?
[194:36.77]Oh, I need to... Okay.
[194:37.67]Well, it's definitely not the finger trap one.
[194:41.09]It's probably this one.
[194:48.13]What are the normal uses for that kind of rope?
[194:51.25]On boats, mooring lines.
[194:54.13]Correct.
[194:54.69]This is a baby's puzzle.
[194:55.67]I didn't know it was a puzzle.
[194:57.53]He just said, there are three things there.
[195:00.53]Look at them.
[195:02.52]Like, come on.
[195:04.52]I didn't know what I was doing until I looked at it for a second.
[195:07.90]So are we looking for a sailor or a minister?
[195:10.42]Well, in my experience, sailors seem to have the greater libido.
[195:13.73]Was Mrs. Muller criminally attacked?
[195:16.45]No external or internal traces of semen.
[195:20.27]I get like one and a half, two seconds to figure out what I need to do with a thing I've never seen.
[195:25.95]Come on.
[195:26.55]I'm not superhuman.
[195:32.50]But I can do this.
[195:37.70]What's this?
[195:38.16]What else you got?
[195:40.67]What's that drink?
[195:48.23]Drink everything in the cabinet.
[195:53.97]Oh, these are clay.
[196:03.74]Dinosaurs.
[196:06.68]Let's see, which one of these is the T-Rex?
[196:08.64]Am I supposed to touch them?
[196:31.20]That's it.
[196:32.38]Very similar to the impressions from the Henry case.
[196:35.62]Now, who do we remember got caught in bloody size eights?
[196:39.28]I think we have our bird.
[196:44.01]Well, thank you, Doctor.
[196:44.73]You've been a lot of help.
[196:47.07]We've got to nail this guy.
[196:49.23]Okay, if you're finished jawing, we need to get moving.
[196:57.69]Okay.
[197:04.29]Oh.
[197:06.41]Thank you, Doctor.
[197:07.01]Okay.
[197:14.14]Uh, bye.
[197:19.93]Go get the nail gun?
[197:21.19]Yeah, that's a really bad sweeping technique.
[197:25.25]That's just gonna put it in the air and make everybody start sneezing.
[197:35.06]Okay, police station time.
[197:48.45]Not exactly the happiest of places, the corners.
[197:52.71]Just go easy, Phelps.
[197:54.22]I had a red light.
[197:58.21]We've got engine noises back, that's a good thing.
[197:59.81]Carruthers is a good man, professional, diligent.
[198:02.67]If you're working with a pro, it's easy to overlook the grim realities of a place like that.
[198:06.69]Funny job, that, coroner.
[198:08.95]How so?
[198:09.72]You know, you don't want them enjoying their work too much.
[198:12.64]Wrong kind of man can get awfully lonely rattling around a joint full of corpses.
[198:16.68]Rusty, that's like something out of The Pulse.
[198:18.70]You been reading the same ones as me?
[198:20.54]I thought you were usually too drunk to get through a magazine.
[198:23.64]You know, if I close one eye and squint, you can just about make out the prince.
[198:32.13]We've played enough missions where I know that if you just get close, it's going to be fine.
[198:41.37]Charge a suspect with murder.
[198:44.41]We'll work the evidence, Rusty.
[198:45.75]Let him do the rest.
[198:47.17]Okay.
[198:49.78]Interview room one, interview room two.
[198:51.34]Alright, where is it?
[198:53.74]Interview room two.
[199:18.03]Which, who's in here?
[199:18.71]Is this?
[199:18.89]Okay, this is Dad.
[199:19.37]Here's where we stand, Hugo.
[199:21.41]Your next door neighbor heard screaming coming from your house.
[199:24.27]You were burning your blood-stained shoes.
[199:26.67]You have no one who can confirm your whereabouts last night.
[199:29.13]Your daughter says you're a violent man.
[199:31.31]We have everything we need to send you to death row.
[199:33.79]And all you have to say for yourself is, I didn't do it.
[199:38.43]I swear I didn't kill her.
[199:40.37]Give me that lie test.
[199:41.21]I can prove it.
[199:42.46]The lie test.
[199:45.72]Give me the lie test.
[199:49.98]Why did you burn your shoes, Hugo?
[199:51.48]This is what I don't understand.
[199:52.86]Because I knew you'd never believe me.
[199:59.28]I mean, what?
[200:00.94]Oh, wait, why did you do that?
[200:02.08]Because you wouldn't believe me.
[200:03.06]Give me a break.
[200:09.51]Are you going to tell me what I want to know?
[200:11.11]Or do we have to take it out of you in lumps?
[200:15.81]Give it your best shot.
[200:17.08]I can take whatever you're throwing.
[200:19.02]Oh, Jesus.
[200:19.88]This guy, you want to play hardball.
[200:21.92]Okay.
[200:22.26]Do you know anything about ropes, Hugo?
[200:28.66]As much as the next man.
[200:31.11]I was a scout.
[200:32.27]I learned some more in the army.
[200:41.88]Do we have anything?
[200:42.62]Can I look at those?
[200:43.52]Rope.
[200:57.47]You learned to strangle with the rope in the army?
[200:59.93]With rope, with my bare hands, but mainly with wire.
[201:04.82]I learned a lot of things in the army, but I still didn't kill my wife.
[201:09.00]For argument's sake, what type of rope would you use?
[201:12.36]If I had to, I would use a triple braid.
[201:15.76]Less flex, easier to control.
[201:17.18]That's what it was.
[201:17.86]That's what it was.
[201:19.22]That's what it was.
[201:22.26]He just said the thing that it was.
[201:26.84]We found your wife's car.
[201:28.42]Someone parked it at the school late last night.
[201:30.48]Do you have anything to say about that?
[201:32.80]It wasn't me.
[201:35.24]Where do you keep your work clothes?
[201:38.44]I keep them at work in my locker.
[201:43.77]Wait, where... That was in the trunk.
[201:53.80]You killed your wife in cold blood.
[201:57.16]Enough lies, Hugo.
[201:58.93]Your overalls put you at the scene of the crime last night.
[202:02.45]My overalls are in the laundry of my house.
[202:06.29]Oh, well, that evidence begs to differ, unless somebody faked it.
[202:11.61]Green overalls, bloodstained, with the initials H.M.
[202:15.25]found in the trunk of your wife's car.
[202:19.15]They can't be mine.
[202:20.88]Oh, what a good excuse.
[202:21.76]How do I, like, just... We just picked it up.
[202:23.08]It was in the trunk.
[202:23.70]Right?
[202:23.92]Tire iron stained with blood found in the trunk of Muller's vehicle.
[202:53.68]You're lying, Hugo.
[202:55.02]You're gonna have to come clean on this.
[202:57.40]I can take whatever you throw at me.
[203:03.74]Put those feet up.
[203:07.42]Your wife drove a Chevrolet, Hugo.
[203:09.34]What make of car do you drive?
[203:11.42]A Chrysler Airflow.
[203:14.24]So I guess that explains why the tie iron that killed your wife came from a Chrysler.
[203:22.22]He did it.
[203:28.53]You're there at the crime.
[203:29.87]You got the bloody tie around.
[203:31.14]Your bloody clothes are in the trunk.
[203:38.12]Check.
[203:38.54]Wait, wait, wait.
[203:40.80]Interrogate the other guy.
[203:43.71]Oh, that's right.
[203:44.07]There's another person.
[203:45.83]Do I, what?
[203:46.29]Do I have to, like, make a choice now, though?
[203:49.17]If I leave this, is it like, Ah, you fucked it up again, Phelps!
[203:52.31]Like it happened before?
[203:53.41]Can I leave?
[204:00.46]Okay.
[204:12.75]Where is the other guy?
[204:13.63]I'm assuming he's in the other interview room.
[204:18.41]Which is... Where?
[204:22.50]Over here.
[204:23.96]Captain, we were on our way to interview Eli Rooney.
[204:27.48]Yes, Phelps, I know.
[204:29.72]This particular fiend is an old acquaintance.
[204:31.98]Old equations.
[204:32.58]Equations.
[204:33.17]I have tried to reaffirm his belief in a wrathful and terrible god.
[204:37.35]Whichever way it goes, I'll be dealing personally with him.
[204:47.47]What?
[204:48.05]Oh.
[204:48.39]Okay.
[204:50.35]You look like you've had it rough.
[204:52.59]You see me asking for your sympathy, boy?
[204:57.03]Ugh.
[204:58.15]Fuck.
[204:58.57]Hold on.
[205:00.70]This is all we have.
[205:08.28]You down on your luck, Eli?
[205:11.99]I have worse.
[205:13.49]My family a roadkill during the Dust Bowl.
[205:16.01]But you have a job.
[205:17.37]A parolee has to have a job, correct?
[205:19.53]I had me a job down in San Pedro.
[205:22.81]I'm looking for something new.
[205:39.24]This place you worked have a name?
[205:40.62]Fantasy Marine.
[205:42.86]I'm so scared.
[205:44.02]Can't misplace big yellow letters H-M-L.
[205:46.02]This game's hard.
[205:47.21]They give you any work wear, Eli?
[205:50.25]Sure.
[205:51.45]Green coverall.
[205:52.71]Now, I know he has the brooch, but so?
[205:59.39]You ever tie up any of your victims, Eli?
[206:02.59]It's not a nice thing to go calling them.
[206:05.43]What would you call them?
[206:06.31]Calling them.
[206:07.84]I can't say.
[206:10.10]I learned a long time ago not to go talking about the things I like.
[206:13.98]What?
[206:14.48]Talking about it just seems to get people's dander up.
[206:17.12]Answer the goddamn question, Rooney, before I brain you.
[206:20.29]See what I mean?
[206:22.75]Short answer is yes.
[206:24.31]You have any preference regarding rope, Eli?
[206:26.97]I know a good rope from a bad rope, if that's what you mean.
[206:31.11]That's not what you mean, is it?
[206:34.83]Any old rope will do me fine.
[206:38.75]That's not true.
[206:42.51]This is a special rope, right?
[206:44.77]Because a special rope would require... Because it was the braided rope.
[207:18.38]Farm boy like you, Eli, must prefer McGee.
[207:20.36]Don't give me the answers.
[207:21.30]Stop.
[207:21.65]Hop for brain till I hit your brain.
[207:25.11]Today's time.
[207:28.61]You can always, okay, listen.
[207:29.99]You can always tell when I'm, like, nervous and waiting.
[207:33.92]It might take a long time.
[207:35.70]Like, I'm like, what is this chat going to say?
[207:37.28]Is this correct?
[207:41.98]What's the motive?
[207:42.52]You killed Mrs. Muller and stole her jewelry.
[207:44.94]That ain't so.
[207:47.05]Ain't done nothing like that.
[207:48.87]bullshit but we I can accuse this right because of the brooch he has the brooch that he stole the brooch you're a liar eli you needed the money so you killed her I've been around some son you got some evidence that proves I stole that butterfly from that woman oh fuck
[208:17.88]I don't think I have evidence of that.
[208:19.06]Feet.
[208:22.95]It's all about the feet.
[208:23.99]Oh, really?
[208:44.70]Put him up here.
[208:45.68]You're maybe 5'5", 5'6", tops, and you wear size 11s?
[208:48.72]Let's see him.
[208:49.34]I don't think so, Eli.
[208:50.64]That might be on the large side.
[208:53.43]Maybe 10s.
[208:54.23]Maybe 8s.
[208:55.35]Now that I come to think of it.
[208:57.31]Why punish children with your iniquity, Eli?
[209:01.05]You think I was never punished?
[209:04.09]You must know what you're doing is evil.
[209:06.89]Well, son, nobody's perfect.
[209:14.05]Can I look at my book?
[209:25.60]You're as good as done, Mr. Rooney.
[209:27.24]All it will take now is some paperwork.
[209:32.86]What happened?
[209:34.85]Did I take too long?
[209:47.80]What?
[209:48.10]Hold on.
[209:48.38]Wait, wait, wait.
[209:48.94]Did I... I... I pressed... I tried to look at my... I pressed the middle PlayStation thing.
[209:57.63]Oh, shit.
[209:58.19]Okay.
[210:06.39]The other guy has so much evidence against him.
[210:10.64]But he keeps on going like, yeah, that's what I do and I like it.
[210:14.20]Like, what?
[210:15.68]How do I know that he's just not murdering other people?
[210:19.40]But the other guy may have murdered... Eli Rooney.
[210:24.75]I'm charging you with the first degree murder of Deirdre Muller.
[210:28.35]You want to put me back in the Ster that badly, boy, you go ahead and try.
[210:31.59]It's wrong.
[210:32.53]I'll beat that rat.
[210:34.45]I ain't a killer.
[210:35.13]It's wrong.
[210:37.63]Phelps, nice work.
[210:38.69]You fucked it up.
[210:57.78]Can I do it?
[210:59.76]Does it tell you if you did it wrong?
[211:01.70]Wrong person.
[211:03.50]You lost.
[211:03.74]Did I?
[211:04.12]Will we never know?
[211:33.35]I'll take it.
[211:33.77]That's fine.
[211:36.17]That's a good C-.
[211:41.17]He was innocent of the murder, but he was a weirdo.
[211:45.83]Hawkeye.
[211:46.83]Hawkeye of mine just came in with $35.
[211:51.64]Thank you so much, Hawkeye.
[211:53.48]Listen to me, son.
[211:54.26]I'm your dad.
[211:55.84]Destroy him.
[211:58.36]Thank you.
[212:00.24]Thank you so much, dude.
[212:03.27]They were both innocent.
[212:13.60]Is that even possible?
[212:18.94]We captured two regular armies.
[212:20.23]Lieutenant!
[212:21.03]We've been over this.
[212:22.19]That sniper barely missed you back on the beach.
[212:24.19]Until the mission is over, there'll be no more saluting or signs of rank.
[212:26.99]I'm in charge here, Metier!
[212:28.73]Do you wish to interrogate the prisoners?
[212:34.58]I know they're beat.
[212:35.82]Why do they look so sullen?
[212:37.61]Wondering why we haven't killed them yet?
[212:39.83]There's no greater shame than being taken prisoner.
[212:41.71]Get this, Golden Boy.
[212:43.15]I just seem to know what he's doing.
[212:44.35]What's your name and what's your name?
[212:46.07]I'm a soldier of the 44th Brigade.
[212:52.91]See that boys he slapped that chap right No, I don't I do but I don't use with a superior.
[213:01.99]I respect the Japanese corporal respect We're here to kill the sons of bitches
[213:07.15]You know why we're fighting the Japanese, Private?
[213:09.37]With respect, sir, these bastards attacked Pearl Harbor.
[213:13.63]And why did they attack Pearl, Private?
[213:15.59]Because they hate the U.S.
[213:17.09]of A and our way of life.
[213:18.85]They attacked the U.S.
[213:19.91]because we cut off their oil.
[213:21.67]What would we do if another country denied us the gas to run our cars?
[213:30.48]This is, uh, okay.
[213:37.24]The Silk Shocking Murder!
[213:47.23]Ah, Phelps.
[213:48.83]I was just discussing with Finbar here how well you were doing.
[213:51.52]I want to eat a shitload of bacon right now.
[213:53.68]A ton of it.
[213:54.70]Like, way too much for my body to handle and I'll get sick.
[213:57.48]You can just forget all about it.
[213:59.18]You boys have a new case.
[214:01.48]A poor Hispanic woman murdered near City Hall and left lying naked in an alleyway.
[214:06.76]Another naked woman, sir?
[214:08.11]Yes.
[214:09.27]We seem to have had quite a run of them since the Dahlia fiend first struck.
[214:12.47]Phelps is politely trying to hint that he thinks... What's the most amount of bacon I've ever ate?
[214:17.37]Every time a package is opened.
[214:19.21]You win some and you lose some in police work.
[214:21.45]We've got to cook that all off.
[214:22.74]What, are we going to fold it up and put it in the fridge?
[214:25.50]You've got to cook it all.
[214:26.50]The whole package opens.
[214:27.38]What are you going to do?
[214:28.00]Fold it up and put it in a Ziploc bag?
[214:29.52]No, you cook it all.
[214:30.42]Get out there and catch me another sinner.
[214:37.34]We'll eat it, right?
[214:44.57]Just put the cooked bacon into Ziploc bags afterwards and put it on sandwiches.
[214:48.78]That's what we're gonna do!
[214:49.76]And then it's gone.
[214:51.86]All of it.
[214:57.26]Alright, we're gonna have another naked murder victim.
[215:03.00]You have the address?
[215:04.32]It's the alley off Aliso between Los Angeles and Alameda.
[215:07.26]You're kidding.
[215:08.64]The next one will be opposite Central Station.
[215:10.18]There's been no random crimes.
[215:12.61]I kind of missed those.
[215:13.67]Those are really fun.
[215:16.25]Yeah, it means they can pop in to hit the office supply of hooch whenever they need it.
[215:20.89]You know, that ain't a bad idea.
[215:23.13]That is not a bad idea at all, though.
[215:25.48]I was told bacon is like the same as pork.
[215:29.04]Oh, man, I spoke too soon.
[215:38.24]Um, but.
[215:41.16]Code 3.
[215:44.04]But turkey, turkey and bacon are, well, they're not the same.
[215:47.46]Turkey is turkey, and bacon is pig.
[215:51.37]You get turkey bacon, which is, tastes good, kind of like shoe leather, but it's, it's kind of like jerky in a sense.
[215:59.47]I like it, I sometimes actually prefer it.
[216:02.49]Is this the remaster?
[216:05.30]Yes, it is.
[216:05.66]This is the one that's on PS4.
[216:06.60]I love turkey bacon.
[216:07.84]I love everything turkey.
[216:09.30]Turkey's my favorite meat.
[216:21.18]Turkey burgers, turkey bacon, turkey patties, turkey dinner, turkey breast, turkey jerky.
[216:29.52]All good.
[216:30.06]Whatever.
[216:30.94]Alright, here comes Kenny.
[216:41.13]Oh my god!
[216:43.67]They killed Kenny!
[216:44.25]The alleyway leads to the rear of the building, sir.
[216:46.76]Someone's gonna have to climb up and take him down.
[216:48.78]Good luck.
[216:49.90]Don't let him get a beat on you like I did.
[216:56.58]Clear the roof.
[216:58.16]Oh, oh, oh, he's going.
[216:59.45]Up, up.
[217:17.14]Alright, if I get a headshot, I get to eat as much bacon as I want tonight.
[217:19.60]If I get a headshot, I get to eat as much bacon as I want tonight.
[217:23.47]That's the rule, I didn't make it.
[217:25.51]Headshot, I get to eat as much bacon as I want.
[217:35.33]Yes!
[217:35.79]I get to eat a ton of fucking bacon!
[217:37.63]Mmm.
[217:37.89]Yay.
[217:52.59]Was I not supposed to kill him?
[218:00.49]Well, I think I was supposed to apprehend him.
[218:04.62]But we do get some bacon out of it, you know.
[218:12.92]Killing somebody for bacon.
[218:15.63]Oh my god, wouldn't you kill for bacon though?
[218:18.55]Epic.
[218:19.24]A post-war labor experiment by a Canadian industrialist.
[218:22.94]The girls are part of a group of 100 who will work in a rayon mill at Saint-Georges-de-Vaux.
[218:29.28]I hate that word.
[218:30.10]If I could delete a word from the English language, it would be epic.
[218:35.01]I would delete it.
[218:36.11]I hate the way it sounds.
[218:37.27]I hate how enthusiastically people say it.
[218:58.45]I hate how it replaces every adjective.
[219:00.92]No.
[219:01.22]Breathe, Elf.
[219:01.92]Breathe, damn it!
[219:03.04]I didn't even do that.
[219:04.54]Epic.
[219:32.05]You want me to drink the seeds?
[219:34.67]I'm gonna drink the seeds.
[219:36.37]They're ready to start the show.
[219:37.67]I'll take you through.
[220:01.41]Oh, fuck this.
[220:02.07]Disgusting.
[220:07.23]Here, let me show you.
[220:09.03]After the cutscene.
[220:11.53]What the fuck?
[220:12.85]Why is somebody naked?
[220:15.43]No one naked.
[220:16.36]Stop killing people and making them be naked.
[220:18.62]Stop this.
[220:20.38]Anyways, look.
[220:21.76]Let me just show you what I'm talking about here.
[220:25.12]That's all seeds down there.
[220:27.54]It's not.
[220:28.00]You don't want to consume this.
[220:29.66]It's just gross.
[220:35.43]It's only seeds.
[220:36.89]In like a little, it's like a tiny little pond of liquid.
[220:45.49]I won't do it.
[220:46.35]I'd rather eat a scorpion.
[220:48.39]Alright, there's a person.
[220:55.82]Jesus Christ.
[221:00.72]Another rope?
[221:01.48]Who's doing all this?
[221:02.69]We keep putting people away.
[221:05.93]Alright, quickly.
[221:09.71]Just examine every piece.
[221:10.65]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[221:14.96]A movie ticket.
[221:15.50]Okay.
[221:15.68]I don't know.
[221:16.00]Maybe.
[221:16.32]Okay.
[221:32.51]Okay, that's it.
[221:33.85]No, other arm.
[221:38.49]Another wedding ring.
[221:39.75]The wedding ring murderer.
[221:40.59]Another wedding ring torn from the finger.
[221:42.13]No skin under the fingernails.
[221:49.44]Okay.
[221:52.85]Good.
[221:53.61]That's it.
[221:54.45]Up.
[221:55.35]The evidence in the Mueller case was solid.
[221:57.01]I'm not convinced about Mendez.
[221:58.91]The best way to get away with murder is to pin it on somebody else.
[222:02.60]I'll bet a month's salary this is a copycat.
[222:05.08]I bet two months' salary.
[222:06.00]Strangle.
[222:06.22]Battered.
[222:06.58]Naked.
[222:06.74]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[222:07.56]We know the M.O.
[222:09.14]So does every jerk who kills his wife and girlfriend looking for a way out.
[222:13.42]I've spoken to Brown.
[222:14.92]He still believes the Dahlia perp has medical experience.
[222:18.79]I'm gonna drink the seeds.
[222:20.19]I'm going for it.
[222:20.93]Don't look over here.
[223:08.81]If she took a blow to the head like the others, she was probably unconscious when strangled.
[223:13.67]Okay.
[223:20.52]Fucking epic.
[223:21.68]Is that it?
[223:24.18]Wait.
[223:24.48]They're never the same, are they?
[223:29.98]What is it?
[223:30.64]Oh.
[223:35.89]May as well follow the trail.
[223:37.19]Do I need to walk there, or what?
[223:45.31]Hat.
[223:45.73]Antonia.
[223:52.23]Same as the library card.
[224:01.63]Okay That's it wait, what are you looking at my help Alright, that's it there's blood all over the door

[224:37.11]Nothing in trash cans.
[224:40.09]Alright.
[224:46.22]Wait.
[224:48.22]Matches.
[224:48.70]Matches are never anything.
[224:50.18]Ever.
[224:52.51]It's never matches.
[225:09.02]I still feel these seeds in my mouth.
[225:10.62]I'm gonna have to go fucking throw up.
[225:13.18]That's rust.
[225:24.40]They're in my teeth.
[225:25.50]It's bad.
[225:27.02]Let me smoke blood.
[225:32.77]Oh, okay.
[225:36.02]Drink water?
[225:36.55]I don't have any water up here.
[225:38.11]Only seeds.
[225:43.77]Shoo.
[225:49.26]Proximity to the scene, plus the bloodstains.
[225:52.18]No way is this coincidence.
[225:54.12]Okay.
[225:57.82]Shoo on head.

[226:50.81]Animal blood?
[226:51.23]Blood.
[226:51.49]Blood.
[226:51.67]Blood.
[227:16.55]It's got to be a code or a cipher.
[227:21.39]253.
[227:22.35]Memorize that.
[227:33.00]Balcony?
[227:36.96]Climb the balcony.
[227:37.64]Where are you taking us?
[227:39.56]Okay.
[227:41.50]To the roof we go.
[227:47.01]What is on the roof?
[227:53.56]That was record time.
[227:55.14]That was record roof time.
[228:02.87]Blood.
[228:05.69]Blood?
[228:09.25]Blood in the bird cage.
[228:13.25]Ah, now that sounds like the title of a great movie.
[228:16.89]Blood in the Birdcage.
[228:22.17]Okay, Mrs. A. Maldonado.
[228:30.02]Federal offense.
[228:31.68]Empty?
[228:32.50]Where is all of this meant to be taking us?
[228:37.60]Okay.
[228:37.92]He clearly wants us to find these things.
[228:40.38]He left them for us.
[228:43.48]There you go, Phelps.
[228:44.30]You got a new ammo.
[228:46.12]I told you.
[228:46.90]More blood.
[228:47.60]Or he might just be getting more confident.
[228:49.86]A DS.
[228:53.40]Ooh, what do you got on here?
[228:57.92]Enameled and gold-plated.
[228:59.92]This was precious to her.
[229:05.85]Can I do anything with this?
[229:11.37]I guess not.
[229:14.82]What?
[229:21.12]New Super Mario Bros.
[229:22.38]DS.
[229:25.75]Who has this much blood?
[229:28.39]You would have died two pipes ago, okay?
[229:35.65]Oh look, another wedding ring.
[229:37.33]I'm the wedding ring killer.
[229:43.26]I kill people and then take off their wedding ring.
[229:48.26]Find me if you can.
[230:05.34]Looks as though the killer was decorating with this.
[230:09.18]So, this is... He's just a sick fuck.
[230:12.23]Okay.
[230:13.67]Well, this is the end of the trail.
[230:16.29]Red bag.
[230:23.78]The other half.
[230:24.34]May 19th, 1945.
[230:25.66]Okay, well, we have an address.
[230:42.74]I think that's the end of the trail.
[230:47.18]Yeah, it kind of has to be.
[230:56.63]Bag secured.
[230:58.29]Whoa, that scared the shit out of me.
[231:00.19]Oh my god.
[231:04.47]That was an explosion.
[231:09.81]It was Mrs. Maldonado, right?
[231:11.59]That's affirmative.
[231:12.70]Right, so then there's a husband we should be looking for.
[231:15.54]Get him?
[231:16.04]We've closed the case.
[231:17.94]Ah, Rusty's razor, of course.
[231:20.14]I don't want to question your tried and tested technique.
[231:23.24]I'm going to be pissed about C. But doesn't the DA require sound casework before he'll close the book?
[231:28.05]Not if he's got a confession.
[231:30.45]And, you know, there's ways of getting it.
[231:32.77]I'm sure.
[231:33.85]Can you imagine if we didn't have the testings in a...
[231:40.98]Stomach and everything like a process all this shit God
[232:05.60]Yeah, imagine you didn't have a stomach.
[232:06.92]No, no, no, not a stomach, but just the way that it separates it.
[232:10.02]You guys don't realize, your body is a gigantic coin separation machine.
[232:14.23]You know when those old machines, you put in the dime, the nickel, the quarter, and it would go, and put it in the right slot?
[232:20.27]If your body didn't have one of those down there, we'd be in a lot of trouble.
[232:26.93]But the weird thing, though, is, even those machines, sometimes you'd put, like, a penny in, and it would fuck up and go in the quarter slot.
[232:32.99]So why are our bodies so good at it?
[232:36.80]How come a nickel doesn't go into the dime slot sometimes?
[232:40.04]If you catch my drift.
[232:55.71]Sometimes I read the one comment that makes me laugh.
[232:59.61]Are you this stupid on purpose?
[233:11.71]I'm here.
[233:14.41]Which one's Kenny?
[233:15.33]Well, Kenny's not here.
[233:16.11]It's not the default police officer.
[233:17.43]Kenny's not in this scene.
[233:39.18]What are they... God damn it, they went down there!
[233:45.47]What the fuck?
[233:47.17]Let's go with the $30 suit bullshit.
[234:10.91]Down again.
[234:13.89]House Flipper.
[234:14.63]It really is the House Flipper bunker, isn't it?
[234:16.55]Oh!
[234:18.47]Alright, the last guy I'm going to punch.
[234:27.35]I want to subdue the last one.
[234:32.14]Got to reload.
[234:34.08]He's got to reload.
[234:35.12]How do I tackle him?
[234:49.01]I tried to hit X. X usually tackle.
[234:54.04]We're getting bacon tonight.
[234:57.00]It's time to eat lots of bacon.
[234:58.54]This is car 11K.
[234:59.78]Shots fired at South Flower Street, Scott's Garage.
[235:03.02]It's code 4 here, but suspect is down.
[235:05.22]I need an ambulance and coroner.
[235:07.75]Code 4.
[235:09.61]So the guy did die.
[235:10.47]11K, Roger on the ambulance and coroner.
[235:13.19]All units, 11K reports code 4 on the shooting at 410 South Flower Street, Scott's Garage.
[235:17.42]Code 4.
[235:21.53]Mr. 985, you've already had too much bacon.
[235:32.42]Do you guys eat eggs in one bite?
[235:35.40]Or do you cut them up and let all the fucking goo go everywhere?
[235:40.76]If you go to a breakfast place, and you order, oh, two sunny-side up eggs, or two over easy, whatever.
[235:45.30]I...
[235:50.51]You do it and you cut it up and... Or you just eat the whole thing.
[235:57.12]Typically what I like to do... I like to separate it.
[236:00.58]I don't really like to have the yolk and all of the other stuff.
[236:03.78]So I'll drop like two or three drops of Tabasco sauce.
[236:06.35]A little bit of salt and pepper.
[236:09.51]The whole thing.
[236:10.07]Just one whole egg.
[236:10.77]Just gone.
[236:11.49]And just enjoy it.
[236:18.92]I'm not the chef.
[236:19.52]I'm a cooked egg.
[236:23.84]Same.
[236:24.76]Same.
[236:25.04]One bite.
[236:25.36]Yeah.
[236:26.24]That's disgusting.
[236:27.10]What?
[236:29.02]You think like 30% of the audience here is disgusting.
[236:33.84]What do you mean?
[236:34.38]What are these topics?
[236:35.16]We're talking about bacon.
[236:36.18]We just had a huge conversation about getting bacon.
[236:39.15]So I'm pivoting the conversation to talk about breakfast.
[236:42.53]Because bacon and breakfast and eggs, it goes together.
[236:46.00]Guys, we're driving around.
[236:47.10]You know, I gotta think of something to talk about.
[236:48.70]It's gonna be bacon, eggs, and toast.
[237:00.03]Weirdos.
[237:04.03]I wasn't even close.
[237:05.03]I wasn't even close.
[237:05.99]I wasn't.
[237:06.65]I just wasn't even close.
[237:08.95]That lady ate shit and I didn't do anything.
[237:19.25]On the radio, dad.
[237:20.15]I'm sick of this.
[237:28.22]Wait just a moment.
[237:29.96]Oh, old lady.
[237:31.32]Hello, officer.
[237:32.38]It's so beautiful to see you.
[237:34.36]I did it.
[237:35.16]She did it.
[237:37.32]I'm sorry.
[237:38.34]Can I help you?
[237:39.93]LAPD, ma'am.
[237:41.11]Detective Phelps and Galloway.
[237:42.71]Does Mrs. Maldonado live here?
[237:44.71]Yes, she does.
[237:45.49]I'm Mrs. Barbara LaPente, the owner of this boarding house.
[237:49.37]Is there a problem?
[237:50.39]I'm afraid so, ma'am.
[237:51.25]Do you mind if we come in?
[237:52.67]Is there somewhere we can discuss this?
[237:54.32]Of course.
[237:55.60]Follow me through to the parlor.
[237:59.34]Wap your feet as you come in, detectives.
[238:01.74]It's this way.
[238:06.59]Sorry, I'm gonna block dirt all over her house.
[238:08.01]Fuck this lady.
[238:09.23]Mrs. Maldonado was found dead this morning.
[238:12.31]Dead?
[238:13.92]Oh, no.
[238:15.36]She can't be.
[238:16.39]I'm afraid she was murdered, ma'am.
[238:18.61]We need to take a look at her things.
[238:20.53]I can't believe it.
[238:22.37]Rude.
[238:22.65]A person seems so alive, and then they're gone.
[238:29.05]Antonia's room is upstairs, last door on the left.
[238:33.22]Thank you.
[238:34.26]We'll be back shortly.
[238:35.56]Thanks.
[238:36.54]Excuse us a moment, ma'am.
[238:43.12]Room is upstairs.
[238:43.94]Alright.
[239:01.40]Another broken window.
[239:02.96]A smashed window explains why the place looks tossed.
[239:12.56]Iron picket, broken window.
[239:14.77]This person smashes windows.
[239:16.19]Shoe.
[239:18.53]Oh, wait, that doesn't matter anymore, does it?
[239:24.93]Smoking auto.
[239:26.45]Okay, another envelope.
[239:29.71]Oh, there's a lot of reading.
[239:35.73]Further to my previous correspondence of August 7th, I am writing to inform you that your petition to the Superior Court of the State of California has been accepted and a court date scheduled.
[239:42.64]Your case, document number 985, will be heard on September 17th.
[239:47.64]I am told that your husband, Angel Christopher Maldano, residing at 30433 N Hills 3, Los Angeles, California, has been served with the official papers and is on notice to appear at the Central District Court.
[240:00.67]Okay.
[240:01.45]Alright, buddy.
[240:02.01]Thank you.
[240:03.17]On the date above, though it is not essential, and many women in your position choose not to do so, I would advise you also to appear at the Central District Court on the scheduled date.
[240:13.04]In my experience, a woman plaintiff's presence in cases like this one can do much to influence proceedings.
[240:18.50]And if your husband does not appear on September 17th, which you have told me is likely, then it can only help your hour of chances.
[240:25.40]Yours sincerely, my signature.
[240:32.37]We gotta see Granny's feet before we reach a conclusion.
[240:35.09]Okay.
[240:45.77]Charm bracelet.
[240:46.29]Charm bracelet wasn't among the crime scene evidence.
[240:49.35]Hmm.
[240:50.29]So it means it was taken.
[240:51.34]That's it?
[241:00.58]We still can't read cursive?
[241:03.12]Can you?
[241:03.42]Alright, now what?
[241:16.07]Did you just label your dining room?
[241:17.65]That's weird.
[241:18.23]Oh, I guess this is like a... Never mind, okay.
[241:22.57]Well, we have some questions, ma'am, if you're up to it.
[241:25.75]Yes, detective.
[241:27.77]I'll do my best.
[241:29.39]Why are you so stupid to not hear somebody breaking into your room upstairs?
[241:34.03]What are you, out of your mind?
[241:38.53]Do you have any idea who might have wanted to hurt Mrs. Maldonado?
[241:41.79]That rat of her husband, Angel.
[241:45.66]She was serving him divorce papers.
[241:47.58]If I killed every wife that served me papers, I'd be a mass murderer.
[241:51.20]Are you being flippant, young man?
[241:53.28]No, ma'am.
[241:58.21]I mean, she's got stone-cold lock-on gaze here.
[242:01.83]I don't... I believe her.
[242:03.49]Stone-cold Steve Austin.
[242:04.11]Movements of victim.
[242:33.34]What time did Antonia go out yesterday?
[242:36.14]She left around nine.
[242:38.00]Do you know where she went?
[242:39.28]No.
[242:40.94]I have no idea.
[242:43.34]She was a good girl, but she didn't confide in me.
[242:48.68]Oh, your stone-cold gaze has suddenly turned into point eyes down.
[242:54.36]A nosy old hag like you knows everything about the people who live under her roof.
[242:59.72]Where did she go?
[243:01.58]I think she went to a bar.
[243:04.92]She's been drinking quite a lot lately.
[243:06.76]This bar have a name?
[243:08.11]El Dorado Bar.
[243:10.41]Got it.
[243:10.73]Latino place on North Los Angeles Street.
[243:13.63]That's only a couple of blocks from where we found the body.
[243:17.87]Evidence of break-in.
[243:19.85]You've had a break-in?
[243:21.71]No.
[243:23.96]No.
[243:26.02]No.
[243:27.42]Wait.
[243:29.76]Did she just not know?
[243:35.76]and tony's rear window smashed glass and damaged a frame maybe she really is just like an old lady and can't hear it you're being economical with the truth Mrs. lapente what do you have to hide I have no idea what you are talking about
[244:06.36]So Antonia lost her keys and used an iron bar to Jimmy the back window?
[244:12.05]I heard a noise in the early hours of the morning.
[244:14.33]Yep, got it.
[244:15.03]I thought it might be a raccoon at the milk bottles.
[244:20.45]It'd be very bad for business if this news got out.
[244:23.80]The neighbor just hit a baseball for the window.
[244:30.80]Antonia and her husband were estranged?
[244:33.80]Yes.
[244:35.45]She moved here after she separated from her husband two months ago.
[244:40.07]But Antonia still wore a wedding ring?
[244:43.13]She wore the wedding ring and a necklace.
[244:45.99]She always wore a religious necklace.
[244:50.23]That's about all of her jewelry.
[244:55.07]What?
[245:00.74]That's not a necklace.
[245:05.29]Lady.
[245:06.37]What about her bracelet?
[245:07.19]Excuse me.
[245:07.67]I don't know anything about a bracelet.
[245:13.24]Oh, you don't.
[245:15.68]In her wedding photo, she's displaying a charm bracelet.
[245:19.60]That thing?
[245:20.90]She never wore it.
[245:22.26]He gave it to her.
[245:23.60]He?
[245:24.04]She always kept it in that wooden jewelry box.
[245:26.34]He?
[245:28.37]Thanks, ma'am.
[245:29.39]It's very helpful.
[245:30.91]Four out of four.
[245:31.79]I got it.
[245:32.81]Lock him up and throw away the key.
[245:37.23]We can either front Angel, seeing as the finger's pointing right at him, or we can check out the El Dorado one.
[245:44.84]I'm in.
[245:46.68]What do you want to do, partner?
[245:51.62]You find him and you throw him away.
[245:53.37]Arrest Grandma for lying?
[246:04.18]This is gonna be so- alright.
[246:06.00]Residence or the bar.
[246:06.92]I mean, we just go in a straight line, right?
[246:11.12]A nosy old hag?
[246:12.62]And I thought I was coming on strong with the ex-wife's line.
[246:17.81]Sometimes you have to be firm to get the information you need.
[246:20.35]Eat the key.
[246:21.01]God damn it, ain't that- How about we drop in on the husband instead?
[246:27.65]See if your gut is right.
[246:28.71]I'll take a bar over a husband every day of the week.
[246:33.77]Well, that wasn't in the first in line.
[246:36.09]That isn't a road.
[246:37.17]Got us here quicker, didn't it?
[246:38.75]Got us here quicker now, didn't it?
[247:06.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[247:12.24]It's all in cursive.
[247:13.14]His wasn't in cursive.
[247:13.80]I could read it.
[247:14.36]304.
[247:14.42]1, 1, 2, 3.
[247:14.50]He does the same thing I do.
[247:15.96]I connect with this guy.
[247:35.69]Since I was probably like 12, I've never walked up the steps one step at a time.
[247:41.51]I always do one, two, two steps at a time.
[247:45.70]Check it.
[247:46.96]Yep.
[247:50.38]Wait.
[247:53.72]I didn't do, I don't do that.
[247:55.86]That's three, no, that's two.
[248:02.65]I can just feel myself doing it.
[248:03.93]Watch out!
[248:04.29]Watch out!
[248:04.97]Here comes a fight.
[248:05.51]I remember how to fight now.
[248:37.50]What did he say?
[248:39.86]What?
[248:40.92]They got some decent shots in there.
[248:45.59]Cuff these sons of bitches, Phelps.
[248:49.41]LAPD, you two are under arrest.
[248:52.77]Call for some backup, Finbar.
[249:03.20]Galloway.
[249:03.94]Badge number 564.
[249:05.00]I need a prowl car at the apartment building 330 North Hill Street.
[249:09.83]Two suspects need transporting to Central.
[249:14.09]Your wife has been murdered, Angel.
[249:16.83]Antonia?
[249:18.59]Oh, God, no!
[249:20.35]Where were you last night, Angel?
[249:21.65]Sit back down.
[249:23.79]I was here with my brother the whole night, God damn it!
[249:26.49]Do you think I could kill my own wife?
[249:29.41]Can you please stop getting up?
[249:31.57]Sit down.
[249:37.40]Canvas the neighbors.
[249:47.52]Well, let's take a look.
[249:51.98]I didn't.
[249:54.04]Well, see, the problem here, buddy, is I didn't get hit once, and you did.
[249:58.88]You weren't paying attention to my flawless victory while you were getting stomped on.
[250:03.76]Pay more attention next time.
[250:08.16]Just picked fruit market.
[250:09.86]Just picked fruits.
[250:10.68]I wonder if Angel gets all his groceries from this place.
[250:18.95]I pick Victory Royale.
[250:28.49]Blood on the shirt.
[250:30.01]In two places, check this one.
[250:32.07]This will take some explaining.
[250:41.84]That's it.
[250:47.87]Alright, let's go.
[250:51.11]Maybe one of the neighbors took notice of Angel's movements.
[250:54.29]He's got no alibi.
[250:55.41]He's toast.
[250:57.45]Neighbor.
[251:02.61]So, this is a neighbor.
[251:07.75]Is this the neighbor?
[251:09.31]What do you want?
[251:10.29]It's the neighbor.
[251:10.91]LAPD.
[251:11.35]We're making some inquiries.
[251:12.59]Make it quick.
[251:13.47]I work nights.
[251:14.49]So you weren't home last night?
[251:15.95]No.
[251:16.71]I was at work.
[251:17.69]Lie.
[251:17.91]You know nothing about Mrs. Maldonado fighting with her husband?
[251:20.76]Those two?
[251:21.68]They're always screaming the place down.
[251:24.08]Thanks.
[251:27.06]Okay.
[251:31.42]I know nothing more about their business.
[251:36.81]Why does it sound like you're talking from the bathroom?
[251:39.70]Okay.
[251:54.07]You can't go this way.
[251:56.21]Oh, yeah, we can.
[251:56.75]Come on.
[251:56.99]Get out of the way.
[252:13.75]Did I miss the- wait, I missed a neighbor?
[252:21.98]I missed a neighbor?
[252:28.62]What are the neighbor?
[252:29.72]Like down the hall?
[252:31.92]Oh.
[252:34.86]There's 20 people in this building, but nobody- they don't know each other?
[252:45.36]Whoa.
[252:46.60]Sorry about that.
[252:47.50]I'm playing with my kids.
[252:49.86]LAPD.
[252:50.92]Were you here last night?
[252:51.84]Playing with my kids?
[252:53.80]My wife and I are separated.
[252:56.74]And I had the kids last night.
[252:58.33]Why are you wearing this fucking mask?
[252:59.21]I put them to bed early and went to bed myself.
[253:01.05]Thanks.
[253:02.73]Okay.
[253:04.17]Well, there's that.
[253:10.75]He's playing rollercoaster tycoon.
[253:12.83]LAPD now.
[253:14.00]Did you hear a disturbance last night?
[253:15.44]Yes.
[253:16.64]Yes, I did.
[253:18.26]Mrs. Maldonado let out of here and her husband ran out after her.
[253:21.66]You saw this, miss?
[253:23.15]A randa.
[253:25.53]I had the door open a crack.
[253:27.03]Did you see Mr. Maldonado come back inside after he ran out?
[253:30.27]No.
[253:30.49]We got him.
[253:32.23]I didn't.
[253:33.22]Thanks.
[253:34.02]We'll be in touch.
[253:36.47]I kept thinking you were going to call that one a nosy old hag too, Phelps.
[253:40.33]Yeah, how much I've sacrificed!
[253:43.71]I'm executing restraint right now, Finbar.

[255:18.53]LAPD.
[255:19.53]Detectives Phelps and Galloway.
[255:21.51]Diego Aguilar.
[255:22.75]How can I help?
[255:23.65]You worked the bar last night?
[255:25.71]Yeah.
[255:26.53]Me and a temp guy from the agency.
[255:28.35]Did you have a woman in here last night?
[255:30.18]21 years old, Hispanic, drinking heavily?
[255:32.58]We have a lot of ladies like that in here.
[255:34.66]But yeah, I know who you mean.
[255:36.32]Antonia Maldonado.
[255:38.34]What did she do?
[255:39.64]She was murdered last night.
[255:42.83]Oh shit.
[255:44.17]Do you know her well?
[255:45.19]Was she a regular?
[255:46.95]Hell no.
[255:47.43]That was a great reaction to that.
[255:48.67]She was good and tight last night complaining about her old man.
[255:52.05]It's a story you get used to working in a bar.
[255:55.13]She was so hammered last night she left a letter on the bar.
[255:57.79]More letters.
[255:59.30]I'll show you.
[256:05.26]A waitress.
[256:06.56]Can I have another spoon?
[256:08.78]Okay.
[256:11.18]Is this one also empty?
[256:18.48]Horse papers?
[256:19.48]To Madlib.
[256:20.34]Did you open them?
[256:23.02]No need to.
[256:24.40]She was shouting about it and waving the letter around.
[256:26.86]Said she was going to show him.
[256:29.82]Whereas Antonio Maldonado did on the 8th day of August 1947 prefer her petition that she might be divorced from the bonds of matrimony entered into with you, Angel Maldonado.
[256:44.11]We do therefore commend that Angel Maldonado that said defend... This is boring.
[256:50.67]You did a bad job with this one.
[257:01.58]What an uncreative Mad Lib, man.
[257:04.34]Alright, uh, hold on.
[257:08.68]Did you bleed on the trail?
[257:19.43]Whatever.
[257:20.26]Can you remember what jewelry she was wearing?
[257:22.70]She had a necklace.
[257:24.32]Some kind of religious thing, I think.
[257:26.91]The temp guy would have more of an idea.
[257:29.31]She took the beer he served her and cried into it all night.
[257:32.37]What time did she leave?
[257:34.06]Can't say for sure.
[257:41.62]Yes, you know, you know.
[257:42.68]Where did she go?
[257:43.86]Give me something or the LAPD will start getting interested in this place.
[257:47.48]Take it easy.
[257:48.12]Closing, squinting his eyes.
[257:49.14]She went to the cab, okay?
[257:50.80]And my phone was out of order.
[257:53.25]The closest one I knew was at the fruit market across the street, so I suggested she try that.
[257:57.41]Fruit market.
[257:58.45]She seemed reluctant.
[257:59.67]We have a place, fruit market.
[258:02.55]Did Antonia say where she was going when she left?
[258:05.07]She said she was going to serve the papers on the husband.
[258:08.03]Said that would take the smile off his face.
[258:11.54]If you ask me, she was scared.
[258:14.20]And the drink was for Dutch courage.
[258:24.64]I buy it.
[258:24.98]Does she attract any interest?
[258:26.72]An extremely drunk young woman?
[258:28.44]What do you think?
[258:30.86]She managed to scare them off, though.
[258:33.34]Thanks.
[258:33.90]You've been a big help.
[258:35.12]Perfect!
[258:36.14]Perfect!
[258:36.60]No problem.
[258:38.70]Hey, get the guy, will you?
[258:42.13]We'll do our best.
[258:43.73]One last question.
[258:44.75]What size shoe do you take, Mr. Aguilar?
[258:47.93]A broad nine.
[258:48.67]I have wide feet.
[258:54.00]Okay.
[258:56.08]Okay.
[259:00.86]He thinks he's a bit of a gangster.
[259:04.69]Okay.
[259:06.95]Show feet.
[259:15.37]Get out of the way.
[259:15.89]Why would you... Get out of the way!
[259:18.77]Can you... Alright.
[259:21.34]Why would you get in this way?
[259:23.76]Why is Eldorado Bar still here?
[259:27.78]What?
[259:28.34]Isn't this where I am?
[259:30.30]Didn't I just do this?
[259:44.96]Oh.
[259:53.44]Out of order.
[259:54.75]Talk to temp guy.
[260:08.69]Sir, do you work here?
[260:09.69]Oh.
[260:10.15]Sorry, pal.
[260:10.71]Just making deliveries.
[260:11.69]From where?
[260:12.81]Just pick fruit market across the street.
[260:14.47]A fruit market delivers here?
[260:16.13]Yeah, sure does.
[260:17.65]The Mexes love a little slice with their tequila.
[260:20.28]We found a crate a lot like the ones you're wheeling there, except it was filled with booze.
[260:23.92]Give me those feet.
[260:24.38]You know anything about that?
[260:26.40]What?
[260:27.28]No, we deliver all over the place, officer.
[260:30.08]Now tell him where the boxes end up.
[260:32.06]Where are these feet, Ben?
[260:33.22]Let me see.
[260:33.84]I have to get on with this.
[260:36.10]Fine, thanks.
[260:41.56]Wait, wait, wait!
[260:42.34]I didn't get your number!
[260:47.95]I saw a telephone.
[260:48.65]Is there anything else to do here?
[260:58.55]Can this be over?
[261:04.66]Do I need to use the phone?
[261:08.60]Call it in.
[261:21.34]Phelps, badge 1247.
[261:24.98]How can I help, detective?
[261:26.16]Where does Hat go?
[261:27.52]Messages for me, please.
[261:29.52]Message from Captain Donnelly, detective.
[261:31.58]Your presence is requested urgently at Central Station.
[261:34.57]A new letter from the Dahlia killer has been found.
[261:37.53]Thanks, ma'am.
[261:39.23]I think his name is Phelps.
[261:40.69]I read about him in the paper.
[261:44.27]You don't remember me?
[261:56.16]Those aren't in this game.
[261:57.28]Sorry, man.
[262:00.72]No, the other Phelps.
[262:06.19]Apparently I'm famous around here for solving all these mysteries.
[262:12.47]I'm not actually waiting for him to get in the car and then move out of the way, am I?
[262:19.27]You don't think it's strange that all these murders are happening to girls who've been out drinking?
[262:23.71]No, no.
[262:24.75]Abroad drinks, she gets a bit tired and starts mouthing off.
[262:29.23]This leads to that, and she ends up in an alleyway.
[262:32.63]It's a sad story, but this town's seen it play out a thousand times, Cole.
[262:36.61]Why don't you want to see a connection here?
[262:38.61]Because there are perfectly good real-life suspects for every one of these murders.
[262:44.24]We don't need to go looking for the monster under the bed.
[262:48.91]Move I need to turn another letter letters Now we sent another I really hate this fuck Shut great
[263:15.17]We'll need to come back later, Phelps.
[263:17.27]Maybe somebody here saw Antonia the night she died.
[263:24.21]What?
[263:24.47]We have to come back at night?
[263:28.67]Oh, why don't you get in?
[263:29.39]You didn't wait for me this time.
[263:39.74]Um... Okay.
[263:42.96]Back to the police station, then.
[263:56.26]Oh, that's cinematic camera.
[263:57.34]Okay.
[263:57.52]Alright, if I get in one car accident in cinematic camera, then I get all the bacon that I want.
[264:31.40]Get out of the way!
[264:32.18]There's a madman on the loose!
[264:35.96]Did I just... Did I just yell... He yelled that out the window.
[264:43.94]Why wouldn't you stop me?
[264:49.31]Why wouldn't you stop the car?
[264:55.33]The captain is waiting for you downstairs with anchor.
[265:03.50]Captain's waiting for you downstairs.
[265:09.26]Where's downstairs room?
[265:12.98]You have to spell it out for me.
[265:14.10]I don't know.
[265:16.96]I'm receiving hospital this way.
[265:18.18]It doesn't say downstairs room.
[265:20.52]How to get downstairs.
[265:21.66]Downstairs.
[265:22.76]Now I know where I am.
[265:39.40]What's up?
[265:41.12]Hey, what's up?
[265:42.00]Ow, my elbow.
[265:43.56]What is the other note?
[266:07.73]This one, that's also new.
[266:09.79]A poem, hand typed.
[266:12.11]Do you mind if I take a look?
[266:14.23]Go ahead.
[266:14.99]You've been over both documents pretty carefully.
[266:17.23]They've been wiped with gasoline, so there's no chance of prints.
[266:20.89]That works.
[266:26.69]Have changed my mind, you would not give a square deal.
[266:30.54]Fuck you, buddy.
[266:43.35]Heap upon thy soul by virtue of this curse.
[266:45.74]He'll read it.
[266:50.46]That's why we called you in.
[266:51.86]You think it's original?
[267:22.30]Not unless he's a genius.
[267:24.44]You like this nut jobs poem?
[267:26.94]No, I like Shelly.
[267:28.72]It was written at least 100 years ago.
[267:31.07]Shelly?
[267:31.81]100?
[267:31.85]Sure, I knew that.
[267:35.05]You see, Finnis?
[267:36.11]I told you this lad was a bright boy.
[267:38.11]Sure, but what does it got to do with the case?
[267:41.25]Prometheus Unbound.
[267:43.08]Prometheus was a titan, a superhuman character who defied the gods to bring fire to humanity
[267:50.34]The Dahlia guy believes he's Superman.
[267:52.84]Your guess is as good as mine.
[267:54.02]Oh, the guy from Kaboom.
[267:55.86]Prometheus and Bob.
[267:57.06]He could have got the wording from the papers.
[267:59.96]As you said, he is fiendishly clever and takes pleasure in taunting us.
[268:03.89]What's happening with the Maldonado case?
[268:06.17]We have the husband in custody.
[268:07.79]We haven't interviewed him yet.
[268:09.97]Well, upstairs then, lads, and see if we can break him.
[268:14.81]Interview Maldonado.
[268:18.25]That was a Boomer reference?
[268:24.68]How is that a Boomer reference?
[268:29.28]My father watched, like, fucking Zorro.
[268:33.45]What are you talking about?
[268:34.93]Improved your attitude, Angel?
[268:41.83]What do you want me to say?
[268:44.06]I was with Antonia the night she died.
[268:46.38]But she left the apartment, and that was the last time I saw her.
[268:51.40]Wait, wait, wait.
[268:52.12]Evidence.
[268:54.31]So we've got bloodied stocking, blood trail, a lady's hat, personal effects, a key, dot pattern note, library card, okay, this is torn over, broken window, iron picket, divorce papers, alright, divorce papers.
[269:14.16]Keep in mind, we have these.
[269:17.24]Charm bracelet.
[269:19.30]Wow!
[269:20.46]Religious necklace.
[269:22.76]Necklace worn habitually by the murder victim.
[269:24.82]Okay, bloodied shirt.
[269:27.96]A men's button-down shirt stained with blood and neighbor.
[269:31.05]Mrs. Arnada testifies to Angel pursuing her from apartment buildings.
[269:36.25]Let's go.
[269:41.59]I can't select this.
[269:43.43]so your wife paid you a visit last night what time was that late around midnight maybe she didn't stay long I mean that's not is that I mean he he chased her but is that technically wrong because she didn't stay long doesn't necessarily mean anything
[270:10.83]He could have chased her at 10 o'clock or chased her at 2 in the morning.
[270:13.80]I mean, it's definitely a lie, but... That's the community.
[270:31.11]Okay, so... You're lying, Angel.
[270:37.01]You went after her.
[270:38.73]I think you killed her.
[270:40.06]You're out of your mind.
[270:41.96]My brother will tell you I was at home.
[270:44.47]Alright, well, then they're... Because then... Because he chased her.
[270:49.33]Okay.
[270:51.31]We have a witness who confirms that you were arguing, that your wife ran out, that you followed her, and didn't come back.
[270:57.25]There's no time frame, is there, for when he ran after her?
[271:00.98]She stayed a little while, and then she left.
[271:03.81]But she went out, and I went out after her, and she jumped in a car on the corner.
[271:07.88]There was a car waiting for her?
[271:09.60]Can you describe the driver?
[271:11.10]Not the driver.
[271:12.44]It was too dark.
[271:14.58]But the car, it was a brown Ford Coupe.
[271:18.43]Okay.
[271:20.41]Divorce?
[271:20.79]Okay, I have the divorce papers, so he can't really lie about this, can he?
[271:23.81]You and your wife weren't getting along.
[271:25.25]She was divorcing you.
[271:26.53]Is that why you killed her?
[271:28.25]We fought, yeah, but...
[271:31.89]I mean, that was his pla- Dude, come on.
[271:34.07]I don't believe you, Angel.
[271:35.19]That was like thrown in my face five times.
[271:37.33]She pushed you too far and you lashed out.
[271:40.15]I told you!
[271:41.87]I asked the community once and they were wrong.
[271:46.67]Uh, where is it?
[271:47.13]Divorce paper.
[271:47.81]This is for him, right?
[271:50.41]Yes, okay.
[271:51.87]The judge had set a date.
[271:53.11]You were going to be paraded in front of the whole city for your cruelty to her, Angel.
[271:58.27]I told you.
[272:00.32]Oh, Jesus.
[272:03.26]She came in drunk, out of her mind.
[272:05.83]She doesn't normally drink.
[272:08.71]She was looking around in her bag.
[272:10.03]What was that?
[272:11.15]Said she wanted to serve me papers.
[272:13.53]Me, her own husband.
[272:15.63]So I slapped her down.
[272:17.52]She ran out.
[272:19.20]That's the truth.
[272:21.72]What size shoe are you wearing?
[272:25.76]What difference does that make?
[272:27.81]Got him.
[272:29.93]Got him.
[272:31.75]When we found your wife, her jewelry had been removed.
[272:34.35]Feet alert.
[272:34.83]Feet alert.
[272:35.19]Was she wearing her religious medallion last night?
[272:37.66]Sure.
[272:38.86]She always wore that.
[272:42.84]Wait, but what about the... Hold on, I just... I fucking was too busy.
[272:57.08]Did he... Did he say bracelet or did he say necklace?
[273:04.28]He said bracelet, right?
[273:07.30]Well, good thing I fucking got it wrong.
[273:09.21]I got it wrong, but I got it right.
[273:10.65]I got it wrong.
[273:11.31]But it's alright.
[273:11.85]Me being stupid actually got it corrected.
[273:28.09]Your wife has been brutally murdered.
[273:30.27]So how do you explain your shirt being covered in blood?
[273:33.61]You found that?
[273:36.23]I cut myself shaving.
[273:38.39]Oh, really, did you?
[273:39.35]Wait, maybe he did.
[273:48.77]That's such a bad excuse, though.
[273:50.65]If you cut yourself shaving, you don't have a pint of blood all over you.
[273:54.21]Sorry.
[273:54.55]Angel, I'm not gonna waste any more time on this.
[273:56.59]Give me something or I'm gonna have you charged.
[273:59.24]My brother.
[273:59.94]You cut, like, your mouth and your eyebrow?
[274:02.28]He said some bad things about Antonia last night.
[274:04.30]I cut myself shaving.
[274:05.36]My eyebrows.
[274:07.14]We got into it.
[274:08.72]Keep talking.
[274:09.97]She said she came from the Eldorado bar.
[274:13.51]And?
[274:13.71]It's not one of my places.
[274:16.87]What's the name of this fruit market just picked fruit Ord Street downtown One last question.
[274:20.94]Yes.

[274:38.21]You're not in the clear by any means, Angel.
[274:41.13]You're going back into a cell.
[274:42.91]You should think about whether you have anything else you need to share with us.
[274:45.05]Can I get at least one perfect and not have like a C- on everything?
[274:49.20]The coroner says it's going to take at least a week to get an ID.
[274:51.66]When I say that now, I'm going to get fucking 0 out of 4 on the next one.
[274:54.30]Just watch.
[274:57.08]Alright, so we need to go to the fruit market.
[274:58.92]I recognize that guy from the papers.
[275:01.20]He's a cop.
[275:03.65]Can I say love you?
[275:04.31]Heavens to Betsy!
[275:07.10]You alright, lady?
[275:13.67]Heavens to Betsy!

[275:35.98]What's your read on Maldonado?
[275:37.74]I still like him for it.
[275:39.50]Seriously.
[275:40.22]That line about the guy at the fruit market making eyes at his woman?
[275:43.36]I don't believe that.
[275:45.25]We'll get to the market and the guy behind the counter will tell us he saw an angel drag his old lady off into the night.
[275:50.15]I wish I was a boomer.
[275:50.99]This case will be shut like all these... What are you talking about?

[278:09.73]You already knew Mrs. Maldonado, didn't you, Clem?
[278:12.87]Sometimes they do make it very easy while they just, like, eyes dart back and forth.
[278:18.77]Her husband went apeshit one day when he caught me talking to her.
[278:22.74]She hadn't been back until last night.
[278:27.34]His eyes are not going crazy, but do I have...?
[278:29.54]But does that always mean that it's the truth?
[278:59.35]Look, I got a lady's hat that you were wearing.

[279:04.19]Brown Ford Coupe, I think.
[279:06.57]She seemed to know the guy.
[279:07.61]Did I do it?
[279:09.61]Do you mind if we look around?
[279:11.25]Why would you want to do that?
[279:12.22]No one has ever done this mission as good as me.
[279:16.42]Don't you have to get a court order or something?
[279:18.08]I have rights.
[279:19.18]Clem?
[279:20.24]Shhh.
[279:27.46]Boomer voice?
[279:34.65]What is this boomer thing?
[279:37.61]Is this like the boomer meme thing?
[279:40.73]Why, because I'm 33?
[279:41.85]What am I even looking for here?
[279:56.24]It's alright, but you ARE a boomer.
[280:04.19]33-year-old boomer stream.
[280:07.65]Ay-yi-yi.
[280:13.31]I just, like, snapped that lady's neck.
[280:16.15]I put my hands up and everything.
[280:17.35]What am I looking for?
[280:18.19]Go in register.
[280:34.14]Ah, secret entrance.
[280:39.53]No wonder he stays open late at night.
[280:42.23]People have to get their vitamins.
[280:44.91]Check through this stuff before we get back out there.
[280:49.91]Looking for meat?
[280:52.43]Am I looking for meat?
[280:56.09]What are you talking about?
[280:58.01]So what are we hiding in here?
[280:59.53]Found the meat.
[281:00.19]This thing needs a combination.
[281:02.48]Oh, uh, wait, wait, I have that, I have that.
[281:04.95]Clues.
[281:10.51]Two, five, three.
[281:17.05]How do I change this?
[281:33.15]Got it.
[281:34.82]And this is the bracelet.
[281:39.82]Okay.
[282:03.90]Hands prayer hands I mean this is that is the bracelet Got that Oh tire iron
[282:35.19]And a scalpel.
[282:38.54]I cut someone who was already dead.
[282:40.08]Because he wanted to take their body parts.
[282:44.22]Once the stiff is dead, the creep usually feels they can do whatever they like.
[282:49.14]Must have seen it during the war.
[282:53.20]What about the tire iron?
[282:53.88]This fruit stall punk gets about ten seconds to explain before I pull his fucking arms off.
[283:00.51]Clip!
[283:10.65]It was the stalker guy.
[283:18.77]He's trying to shoot his tires out.
[283:27.88]This guy is just the tire shooter.
[283:30.54]He doesn't do anything else.
[283:32.34]I bring him along because he's the one party member that has revived in the group.
[283:35.54]Jump!
[283:35.64]Nice.
[283:42.12]Ah, he's going so cleanly.
[283:43.10]Get the tire!
[283:43.84]You idiot.
[284:09.94]The fruit guy's getting away, Phelps.
[284:18.98]Now who's about to get picked?
[284:21.78]Alright, get it.
[284:23.31]Hit him, Cole.
[284:24.25]Spit him out.
[284:27.45]Keep it stabbing.
[284:28.29]I'm trying to bust his tires.
[284:31.91]Did I kill him?
[284:32.67]No.
[284:41.02]You're under arrest.
[284:51.21]You're a sick man, Clem.
[284:52.51]You need help.
[284:56.93]Perfect?
[284:57.97]Did I get my first perfect?
[284:59.41]Oh, no.
[284:59.95]Don't.
[285:00.19]Come on.
[285:01.56]Is there more?
[285:01.98]Outstanding job on this case, gentlemen.
[285:04.76]The poor woman can now rest in peace.
[285:07.91]I'll pay the fiend a personal visit myself and remind him that crime in this city does not go unpunished.
[285:13.45]He wants to personally talk to everybody.
[285:14.75]When they finish with him at the receiving hospital, we'll have him up before the grand jury.
[285:20.06]I have a meeting this afternoon with the mayor, lads.
[285:23.00]I'll be sure to mention your names.
[285:25.50]Now, on your way.
[285:39.36]Just, like, throw him down on the ground and just start fucking cuffing him.
[285:46.55]17 is- oh, yes.
[285:49.13]I did it.
[285:52.15]17 and 17, 13 and 13, that is an A+.
[285:56.26]But, with all the damage, that brings it down to, like, an A-, probably.
[286:06.87]It's the first, well, I'm gonna get one.
[286:11.09]Sarge, why are the guys giving it to the doggies?
[286:13.96]They're riding in trucks, numbskull, while you're marching.
[286:16.28]They look pretty badly beat up.
[286:17.62]Yeah, they do at that.
[286:19.30]Scuttlebutt says it's pretty hard going down south.
[286:21.42]We'll find out soon enough.
[286:23.14]Recon always leads.
[286:24.34]How can we fail?
[286:25.12]Skip with the shadow leading the show.
[286:26.74]Who the fuck is a shadow?
[286:27.90]Lieutenant Phelps, the shadow of death.
[286:29.74]What the fuck are you talking about?
[286:31.56]He's a quiet fucker, Sarge.
[286:33.95]never hear the bastard coming sitting there field stripping a cigarette and suddenly he's there looking down on you why do you think we keep saluting that jab loving son of a bitch you bad juju that's enough out of you three bad juju where are you dragged up a swamp alright I'm gonna pee and I'll be back one more time we will do the next case probably and see where we're at
[287:04.35]We'll do another cave.
[287:05.13]The white shoe sleds and more... More shoes.
[287:30.84]I'm just going to go into the game.
[287:31.98]I'm going to data mine the game and just look at the guy's face.
[287:37.33]Good morning, gentlemen, and what a grand morning it is, too.
[287:41.41]We have just cause for celebration.
[287:43.85]Galloway and Phelps are sending another fiend to San Quentin.
[287:47.01]A nice showy trial, and he'll be strapped down with gas seeping into his tiny reptile brain.
[287:54.09]Now.
[287:55.11]The fresh business.
[287:56.05]Oh, you can just go to YouTube.
[287:57.87]The task is at hand.
[287:59.22]Yeah, you could.
[288:00.24]The address is on the hill, north downtown off Fremont Avenue.
[288:05.34]Mystic is taking a little crime scene, murder victim, crime scene.
[288:07.71]Skipper, is the new letter genuine?
[288:09.57]Alright, let me peek.
[288:10.75]Now, boys, we all know how many imbeciles have come here.
[288:13.89]Give me a second.
[288:14.43]I'll be right back.
[288:16.77]We will do another case.
[288:19.01]And then we'll see where we're at.
[288:20.29]We might call it 8, 9, 10, 11.
[288:22.78]It's like 11 Eastern.
[288:24.28]Yeah, I'd say one more will be decent, I think.
[291:57.12]Alright.
[292:06.06]Hello.
[292:08.54]Let's do the short case.
[292:10.32]Ray Pinker will let us know in good time.
[292:12.00]What are we doing?
[292:13.80]A fine morning indeed.
[292:15.72]We keep locking them up, but the bodies keep piling up.
[292:18.85]Ah, California's love effect, Phelps.
[292:20.69]As long as the bricks hold up to San Quentin, they'll always be killed at the same time.
[292:25.35]Weather effects?
[292:26.67]Greetings from sunny California.
[292:28.67]Ooh.
[292:29.45]When's it gonna stop?
[292:32.57]It rains in California?
[292:35.14]When?
[292:37.12]That's the most surprising.
[292:38.04]We've seen people get murdered.
[292:42.26]Cars flying off cliffs, people getting shot, but rain in California.
[292:48.14]Shocking.
[292:49.36]First the letter, and now another body.
[292:50.94]Come on, you can't keep on telling me there's not a killer still out there.
[292:54.96]Hello, folks.
[292:55.62]All these arrests on your record are giving you a reputation.
[292:59.44]This is back when it rained.
[293:01.04]Getting a vicious killer off the streets is more important than my reputation.
[293:04.94]Really?
[293:05.80]And besides, landing a big fat marlin is more impressive than an ocean full of minnows.
[293:09.81]The minnows make it the man, folks.
[293:12.51]You can't always hit home run.
[293:14.57]Sometimes you just gotta make it.
[293:18.19]We've got a random crime over this way.
[293:21.05]What did we say about an investigation?
[293:29.85]Please, you've got to call for help.
[293:31.95]He doesn't look real good.
[293:33.34]Quick, what happened?
[293:34.62]Some punk held up my stand.
[293:36.32]This guy tried to help and got a bullet for his trouble.
[293:39.26]He got hit and hightailed it through the parking lot.
[293:41.50]Get going.
[293:45.48]Oh, it wasn't lying.
[293:48.96]I thought this was just an elaborate bruise.
[294:02.27]That wasn't enough, apparently.
[294:03.93]What is with that AI pathing?
[294:07.97]Come on.
[294:09.54]What?
[294:09.94]Nobody can do that.
[294:24.62]They're pursuing.
[294:25.52]They're pursuing.
[294:26.90]We're pursuing.
[294:27.67]If you come any closer, I'll pull the trigger.
[294:31.99]Put the weapon down now.
[294:33.03]What the hell?
[294:39.52]What are you waiting for, self?
[294:43.02]I'll get at him.
[295:07.74]I did it.
[295:12.66]Got a code 4.
[295:14.18]Got a code 4.
[295:15.10]Car 11K calling KGPL.
[295:16.85]Shots fired.
[295:17.75]Suspect is down.
[295:18.75]We're code 4, but I need an ambulance on Grand between 4th and 5th streets.
[295:25.67]Oh, wait.
[295:26.30]That guy was down there.
[295:27.76]It wasn't in the streets.
[295:30.40]Oh, well.
[295:36.41]Another crime?
[295:41.97]No?
[295:42.75]Maybe?
[295:48.22]The rain's gonna put out the fire.
[295:50.14]See?
[295:50.44]It's fine.
[296:08.30]Nice weaving.
[296:13.50]So what... What do you mean, that guy?
[296:20.49]Hold on.
[296:22.81]Squad car?
[296:26.58]I'm stealing myself from what I'm about to see.
[296:35.43]I know where it is.
[296:36.11]Do I need to follow this dude still?
[296:41.59]Apparently.
[296:42.09]Alright, two naked bodies.
[296:51.42]Three naked bodies is like really rolling dice here.
[296:57.70]Let's hope it's somebody with, like, a sweater on.
[297:01.82]Scene secure.
[297:02.73]The rest of the patrolmen are going door to door, canvassing for witnesses.
[297:05.81]Thanks.
[297:06.23]Keep me informed.
[297:07.31]Will do, detective.
[297:09.10]This looks awfully familiar.
[297:11.28]I think that's the impression the boys from the examiner took with them as well.
[297:14.70]There's nothing original under the sun.
[297:16.98]Why should murder be any different?
[297:18.67]What do we have so far?
[297:20.01]Not much trace evidence to speak of.
[297:22.61]Storm blew in around 10 last night and the rain washed most of it away.
[297:26.21]And the body?
[297:26.91]Most of it away.
[297:27.37]Looks like she was tipped out of an automobile from the tire tracks and superficial injuries.
[297:32.31]Strangled with a length of rope.
[297:33.89]For my money, it's triple braid again.
[297:37.74]Time of death.
[297:38.88]From her temperature, maybe 2 a.m.
[297:41.40]But it was cold last night.
[297:43.02]Usual head injuries.
[297:44.16]Yeah.
[297:44.98]Lung force trauma.
[297:46.40]Knock him over the head, then strangle him.
[297:47.78]She's wearing a sweater.
[297:49.06]No message with this one.
[297:50.84]At least she was left clothed.
[297:52.99]I doubt very much he was concerned with her dignity.
[297:55.61]The green silk dress is very distinctive.
[297:58.43]Any sign of her other shoe?
[298:01.31]No.
[298:02.65]And no handbag or other personal effects.
[298:11.10]Alright, time of death is 2.
[298:12.21]Let's take a look.
[298:15.81]Here's that braid.
[298:17.01]That braided strangulation.
[298:21.89]Oh.
[298:22.29]Superior Laundry.
[298:23.41]Okay.
[298:23.59]What about the wedding ring?
[298:25.03]No wedding ring.
[298:25.55]Okay.
[298:49.56]So she wasn't married.
[298:53.50]Anything else?
[298:57.52]I can't do anything else.
[299:06.91]More shoes.
[299:07.89]Booth prints.
[299:08.55]Okay.
[299:23.46]It's always five dollars.
[299:25.76]Circumstantial.
[299:26.40]This reminds me of Left 4 Dead.
[299:32.62]Well, yeah, like, when you find a witch.
[299:35.78]This is the You Found a Witch music.
[299:37.10]Alright.
[299:37.30]Phone.
[299:37.42]Phone.
[299:54.19]Use phone.
[299:54.75]Every time I see a phone, I use.
[299:55.87]Oh.
[299:56.45]What is this?
[300:02.79]Are these the other cops?
[300:11.87]Are we about to be relieved?
[300:16.29]Is this FBI kind of... Oh.
[300:23.63]Detective Phelps, LAPD.
[300:25.49]I'm Mrs. Barton, Katherine Barton.
[300:27.83]I live just across the way.
[300:31.66]Witness and Signal Hill resident.
[300:35.24]Did you see anyone around here last night?
[300:37.56]Not last night, but yesterday early evening, I saw that awful hobo.
[300:48.13]Why would you come to us to lie to us?
[300:51.47]Tall, gaunt, horribly disfigured.
[300:54.20]I think he may have had an accident in the war.
[300:56.52]Officer, here, I have some information for you.
[300:58.12]Let me flag you down.
[301:01.05]Any idea where we might find him?
[301:03.20]One of the hobo camps around here.
[301:05.20]He's some kind of hobo leader.
[301:07.26]They all follow him around.
[301:08.38]A hobo leader.
[301:10.23]Thank you, ma'am.
[301:10.99]You've been a big help.
[301:12.93]Why would you lie right off the bat?
[301:15.67]You flag down a police officer to lie to him?
[301:17.33]Phone.
[301:37.40]Phelps, Badge 1247.
[301:40.73]How can I help, Detective?
[301:43.05]I need an address on Superior Laundry Services.
[301:46.09]Just a moment.
[301:48.79]Superior Laundry Services.
[301:52.74]1260 West First Street.
[301:55.26]Can you track down reports of hobo camps in the vicinity of Signal Hill?
[301:59.38]Just a moment, Detective.
[302:04.48]There's a large camp under the bridge on Grand
[302:08.92]detective you're hallucinating this is a birdhouse oh okay sorry okay should we go to laundry place or should we go to the hobo camp
[302:36.53]I mean, I don't know what you guys are gonna say.
[302:38.35]But we have to go on a straight line.
[302:43.65]I don't do them out of order, even though maybe you're supposed to at some point.
[302:48.16]No message.
[302:49.98]If we survive this, it's gonna be a miracle.
[302:53.59]Well, start saying your prayers, and you're alive.
[302:57.81]Excuse me?
[302:58.33]There was no message.
[302:59.47]Where?
[302:59.97]On the Vic.
[303:00.99]The last bodies had something written on them.
[303:03.11]This one didn't.
[303:04.13]I'm failing to follow you.
[303:05.41]Can't be the same guy is what I'm saying, right?
[303:08.21]Before you start trying to link this to Maldonado and all the others.
[303:12.48]There are more factors to consider than the messages, Rusty.
[303:15.74]This doesn't fit your pattern, Cole.
[303:17.80]End of conversation.
[303:19.22]Understand?
[303:22.22]Okay.
[303:23.92]I mean, he has a point.
[303:24.86]You do have a point.
[303:40.67]At least the rain stopped.
[303:42.40]We can change back into those white bucks now.
[303:45.66]Alright.
[303:46.34]Laundry.
[303:48.06]Laundry.
[303:53.29]Who's got laundry information here for me?
[303:55.15]Felton Galloway, LAPD.
[303:57.11]We're investigating a case and one of your laundry labels came up.
[304:00.27]F-1-3-6-3.
[304:04.34]If you give me a minute, I'll go find a register and you can take a look.
[304:08.70]Okay.
[304:15.54]What was that like a little hesitation?
[304:17.50]I've got clothes that need pressing.
[304:21.74]This guy acted a little weird.
[304:23.06]Uh, I... Hold on.
[304:23.56]What the hell is this name?
[304:37.26]Laundry label.
[304:39.47]Uh, laundry label found on victim floor F-1363.
[304:40.93]F-1363.
[304:41.01]F-1363.
[304:53.81]F1363.
[304:55.45]There it is.
[304:57.03]Mrs. T. Taraldson.
[305:00.61]43 Emerald Street.
[305:03.61]One times green silk dress.
[305:07.76]Bingo.
[305:08.72]Mrs. T. Taraldson.
[305:10.38]43 Emerald Street, Westlake.
[305:14.92]Yeah, I just wanted to read it.
[305:19.12]Um...
[305:23.48]Did it?
[305:23.78]Should I just put coins in everybody's machines and turn it on to, like, two more hours?
[305:33.94]Or should I take out laundry and, like, put them in random tubs?
[305:38.00]Just fuck the whole thing up.
[305:39.18]Just throw somebody's, like, you in that one.
[305:41.26]One goes into four, four goes into three, three goes into eight, eight goes into fifteen.
[305:56.71]You monster.
[306:00.91]Um, alright, well let's... just go to the hobo camp.
[306:04.60]Large, vagrant camp under bridge.
[306:06.58]I think we ought to investigate the hobo need.
[306:08.50]Under the bridge, too?
[306:09.90]Okay.
[306:13.49]We're going under the bridge.
[306:14.91]Use the toins.
[306:15.23]Toins.
[306:15.39]Now I get why you guys are doing ResidentSleeper with that, because that- that music comes on.
[306:38.45]Now I get it.
[306:40.20]I get it now.
[306:44.32]That seems like a really dangerous song to play when you're driving.
[306:57.11]I guess.
[306:57.47]Headaches.
[306:59.43]You wouldn't have such a headache if you didn't take so many cocktails before dinner.
[307:03.53]Why do you do that, John?
[307:04.97]Always.
[307:05.97]Always.
[307:07.21]Why?
[307:07.65]No good to eat on empty stomachs.
[307:10.45]Aw, I was trying to make an entrance.
[307:11.39]You're going to kill us!
[307:12.67]How did you know anyway, because that's Steve's trade?
[307:15.27]Something's flashing in my eye.
[307:20.13]Take an aspirin.
[307:21.09]OK.
[307:22.83]Do I actually have to go all the way?
[307:24.05]We can just jump the fence, right?
[307:25.19]Okay, that's fine.
[307:38.54]That's fine.
[307:39.66]Okay.
[308:17.09]Slow and steady, come on!
[308:18.99]He stole your gun.
[308:25.99]He stole your rifle.
[308:27.99]So I can't do anything?
[308:29.87]I've got a feeling we're about to meet another wife killer.
[308:33.09]You've always got that feeling, Rusty.
[308:34.79]Yeah, and it's usually correct.
[308:36.93]Please, please, for once, can you not let your assumptions color your detective work?
[308:42.01]Waste of time.
[308:44.09]Just go easy, Phelps.
[308:45.85]Waste of time.
[308:50.93]Just you wait.
[308:52.25]Nordic types show a particular disposition for this stuff.
[309:05.78]Keep la safe drive safely sure thing I'll try So
[309:25.61]Preferred toppings on a toasted bagel.
[309:28.45]Oh, that's tough.
[309:31.46]I mean, there's two or three different avenues you can go down there.
[309:37.24]The luncheon in me would say... One slice of tomato.
[309:42.70]Tuna fish.
[309:44.59]And... Maybe a slice of Swiss cheese.
[309:49.35]Now, this is a breakfast scenario.
[309:52.29]You're talking about... Mmm...
[309:58.21]Egg and bacon and cheese, like bacon, egg and cheese is one of my favorites.
[310:02.69]Or chive and onion cream cheese.
[310:06.39]Now if it's a dinner scenario, we're talking a piece of turkey, hot turkey and gravy.
[310:13.33]For dessert, you could put a little bit of maple syrup on it and throw just a little bit of ricotta cheese on it.
[310:22.05]And that's dessert bagel.
[310:24.05]It really depends.
[310:29.74]Hello?
[310:30.86]Yes?
[310:31.50]Detectives Phelps and Galloway.
[310:33.58]Is your wife home, sir?
[310:35.42]Fancy bagel dinner.
[310:36.66]She hasn't come home.
[310:38.93]Can you describe your wife?
[310:40.09]I love salmon, but I don't like salmon.
[310:41.59]I don't like lox on bagels.
[310:42.95]Bobby Ross is for a party.
[310:45.35]She was kind of dolled up.
[310:47.35]She had her green silk dress, open-toed white shoes.
[310:51.78]Those are her favorite shoes.
[310:53.36]Can we come in, Mr. Tarleton?
[310:54.98]I'm afraid we have some rather bad news.
[310:58.96]I recognize this actor.
[311:01.32]Do you have someone who can look after your children, Mr. Terreltson?
[311:04.20]I've been trying to arrange a sitter.
[311:05.44]Look, tell me what's happened.
[311:08.94]I'm afraid your wife was murdered last night.
[311:11.67]Her body was found this morning.
[311:13.47]We're very sorry for your loss.
[311:19.71]I know this is a difficult time, Mr. Terreltson.
[311:21.75]Boomer alien eats disgusting bagels?
[311:24.17]No way.
[311:25.51]What for?
[311:26.63]You don't think that...
[311:29.57]You see to your girls.
[311:37.22]Dad, what's murder mean?
[311:38.92]Oh, Jesus.
[311:47.34]Stay here till Daddy's finished talking to these men.
[311:49.42]Where's Mommy?
[311:50.80]Everything's gonna be alright, sweetheart.
[311:52.66]We would like Mommy to come home now, Daddy.
[311:55.66]What's the problem, Terrelson?
[311:57.56]Let him search.
[311:59.36]Funny.
[311:59.54]You know, more cigarette stuff, more matches.
[312:05.02]But this is important.
[312:06.34]Barron's Bar.
[312:27.97]Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[312:33.21]Got it.
[312:45.04]This doesn't pertain to the case.
[312:46.72]Is it chocolate?
[312:56.82]Optimistic call.
[312:58.86]Isn't that the butterfly brooch?
[313:01.48]Symbol?
[313:02.00]Is this gonna be, like, some weird thing where that shows up all the time?
[313:11.40]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[313:12.24]We might have some fucked up drawings here.
[313:14.71]No, chocolate.
[313:20.59]Is this bottom right one, like, murder and blood and shit?
[313:23.31]I don't know, that's weird.
[313:38.28]Not sure this means much.
[313:40.02]How?
[313:48.14]More Baron's Bar.
[313:51.70]Baron's Bar again.
[313:53.64]Someone must be real sweet on this dive.
[314:00.14]What?
[314:03.23]I wonder why the picture was turned down.
[314:07.94]That is odd.
[314:10.42]But somebody may have knocked it over.
[314:12.26]It's in a really weird place.
[314:14.68]That's in a very knockable over place in the bedroom.
[314:28.30]Hi, kids.
[314:29.00]If you'd excuse me, ladies.
[314:31.21]No.
[314:35.14]Incidental.
[314:49.36]So she went out without her handbag?
[314:51.56]No, OK.
[314:52.50]Handbag?
[314:52.98]What's this little mini chalkboard?
[314:55.72]She'd have to be in quite a state to leave this behind.
[314:58.13]Is this a driver's license?
[315:06.28]At least she was spared that particular indignity.
[315:10.22]That's it?
[315:15.22]Nothing?
[315:17.30]Nothing of interest?
[315:18.04]That's it.
[315:30.97]Oh, feet!
[315:32.71]Let me guess.

[317:04.20]It was the boat.
[317:04.74]The boat did it.
[317:06.08]Cole Phelps, batch 1247.
[317:11.02]How can I help, Detective?
[317:12.08]Sir, are you aware that your boat is a fucking killer?
[317:13.66]Can you run an address for a Bobby Ross?
[317:15.64]Then send some uniforms over.
[317:18.18]Would you like him picked up?
[317:20.10]No.
[317:21.32]Suspect says he was with Ross last night.
[317:23.34]We need to confirm the alibi.
[317:25.72]I'll get a prowl car dispatched.
[317:28.50]Thanks for your help.
[317:35.32]Okay.
[317:42.93]For the record, Mr. Terreltson, what is your wife's name?
[317:46.05]He doesn't even know his wife's name.
[317:49.05]Why?
[317:50.07]It's Judy.
[317:52.53]Ah, shit.
[317:53.05]Alright, you might as well take me in.
[317:58.29]Okay, hold on.
[318:05.16]2 a.m.
[318:05.50]Is when she died she went to the laundry store His boots tires the laundry store Barron's bar Vampire handbag Muddy boots size 8 hmm wet jacket Freddy Krueger style hmm.
[318:31.04]Oh
[318:33.31]Triple braid patterned on the bow road.
[318:34.91]Okay.
[318:35.25]I'm ready.
[318:35.45]Okay.
[318:37.05]That's pretty truthful.
[319:00.84]So you don't know anyone who would want her dead?
[319:03.82]No, I don't.
[319:07.32]Okay.
[319:07.58]Does he have an alibi?
[319:10.34]You said you went to a party at Bobby Ross's place?
[319:13.05]That's right.
[319:13.45]Bobby had a bunch of people over.
[319:15.23]We were having a good time.
[319:17.09]She said she was bored and decided to leave.
[319:30.07]I Twitch.
[319:30.45]I Twitch.
[319:30.87]There it is.
[319:31.35]Baron's bar.
[319:31.67]Victim's state of mind.
[319:59.03]Mr. Terreltson, was Teresa happy at home?
[320:02.66]Yeah, I think she was.
[320:09.32]Why can't you just look straight ahead?
[320:11.40]You gotta play more poker, man.
[320:14.04]Or just wear sunglasses.
[320:15.52]Wear sunglasses during- Okay, if you ever get investigated by the police, just wear sunglasses.
[320:19.36]Crazy enough to kill.
[320:39.64]Alright, well, she died at 2, so that would make sense.
[320:50.04]Why is he looking at the ceiling?
[320:51.40]Hmm.
[321:09.93]He's got... Hold on.
[321:14.03]Are these... Are these the right boots, though?
[321:22.14]I'm not sure these are the right boots.
[321:26.45]They're size 8's, right?
[321:29.33]You're lying, Lars.
[321:30.83]You didn't come straight home, did you?
[321:33.01]And how do you figure that?
[321:35.13]Because you have size eight shoes.
[321:38.17]That's a stretch, isn't it?
[321:41.33]You were out in the rain.
[321:42.66]You got soaked, Lars.
[321:43.94]We found your wet weather gear.
[321:45.26]I guess.
[321:46.46]Okay, I stayed a little later than I said.
[321:48.90]This cute little brunette was hitting on me.
[321:52.06]Teresa noticed.
[321:53.71]I was half cut.
[321:55.49]I walked her home from Bobby's, but nothing happened.
[321:59.25]I walked back and got the car this morning.
[322:02.55]Thanks for answering our questions, Mr. Terrelson.
[322:05.18]You'll need to go downtown to identify your... What did I get wrong?
[322:08.34]I should have taken her dancing.
[322:10.16]In my experience, Mac, be given to broads, you'll be given into them your entire life.
[322:16.18]Sounds like the Terrelson broad had her last drink at Baron's bar.
[322:19.16]We should check the place out.
[322:21.00]Not the first one.
[322:24.06]Appreciate your time, sir.
[322:25.76]You believe this guy's story?
[322:27.68]Kind of rings true.
[322:37.14]Barron's Bar.
[322:38.26]I'll see you there, folks.
[323:00.68]That's an explosion waiting to happen.
[323:03.62]That's an explosion.
[323:05.09]Watch out for that.
[323:06.15]You don't want to make an explosion.
[323:32.18]That's not it.
[323:41.97]Alright, let's go on the bar.
[323:44.41]Would you recommend a special, miss?
[323:46.91]Gents?
[323:48.09]Drink?
[323:49.30]Felton Galloway, LAPD.
[323:51.34]I'm Benny Clough.
[323:53.04]It's about Teresa Terrelson?
[323:54.72]Yes, it is.
[323:55.66]I heard about it on the radio.
[323:57.62]They're saying it was that Black Dahlia freak again?
[324:02.57]Yeah, I rang that husband of hers.
[324:04.43]The babysitter said he was out.
[324:06.43]If you don't mind, we have a few questions.
[324:12.90]What time did Teresa leave?
[324:14.66]Around 10.30, I think.
[324:18.02]10.30.
[324:19.64]Husband said 10.
[324:20.34]She died at 2.
[324:23.90]He's just answering a question.
[324:26.17]On foot?
[324:26.81]In a car?
[324:27.59]By bus?
[324:28.23]How was it?
[324:29.11]She called for a cab.
[324:30.15]Did you get the number?
[324:31.47]Sure I did.
[324:32.55]I like Teresa.
[324:34.05]The only time she has a drink is when things aren't going so good at home.
[324:38.38]I was worried about her.
[324:41.78]I thought he was getting a gun.
[324:43.04]Whoa, that went crazy there for a second.
[324:45.64]Put out an APB on the cab.
[324:48.93]3591.
[324:49.37]Should be traceable.
[324:51.89]Ryan Ice, Manhattan.
[324:53.13]Gin, Ricky.
[324:55.19]Four drinks.
[324:57.31]Okay.
[325:01.89]What about the hobo?
[325:02.87]Did we lose that whole section here?
[325:04.49]I don't understand.
[325:05.06]Okay.
[325:05.28]It's always the eyes.
[325:06.10]The likelihood is that whoever she left here with killed her.
[325:25.32]And the other man?
[325:26.04]Sailor.
[325:27.16]Okay.
[325:54.16]Any idea where she was headed?
[325:56.29]Nope.
[325:57.23]I didn't get that.
[325:57.87]Oh, really?
[326:19.17]Don't know where she was.
[326:20.73]Well, he's telling the truth.
[326:22.83]Oh, the USSS?
[326:23.31]Toy boat!
[326:44.34]I can't let this son of a bitch get away.
[326:46.92]Everybody always runs away.
[326:48.86]It's a very long, drawn-out chase.
[326:50.70]Go, Phelps!
[326:51.08]Get after it!
[326:53.01]You're gonna hit by the car?
[326:55.33]Come on.
[326:56.15]Gotta ride.
[326:57.57]Get in and drive.
[326:59.23]That was convenient.
[327:01.67]I thought you were gonna leave me there.
[327:03.85]Who knows what this guy will pull when he's cornered.
[327:05.69]We could have a killer on our hands.
[327:08.25]I really love this Invader Zim music.
[327:15.24]Ow, my ear!
[327:15.52]My ear!
[327:15.84]That was so loud.
[327:17.14]Oh my god, that hurts so bad.
[327:17.90]It fucked up my whole game.
[327:18.90]There was too many audio clips played at the same time.
[327:21.26]Those are the loud sounds!
[327:21.96]Turn them down.
[327:45.69]Maybe you shouldn't have waited for me, Phelps.
[327:49.76]Oh, fuck.
[327:57.26]Damn it!
[327:58.34]Damn it!
[327:59.24]I didn't go fast enough.
[328:02.46]Oh, damn it.
[328:05.19]I tried.
[328:05.97]I thought I had it.
[328:10.01]I thought I had it.
[328:11.23]Oh, well.
[328:12.51]Oh, fuck.
[328:18.72]Alright, shoot his tires.
[328:19.74]Another drill.
[328:21.02]I'll try to shoot out his tires.
[328:22.82]Wish me luck.
[328:31.46]Let's end this, Ars.
[328:33.62]Alright.
[328:34.00]Alright, you got me.
[328:36.02]I've had enough.
[328:38.42]Put your hands where I can see them.
[328:40.92]Okay, Bates.
[328:42.28]You're gonna answer some questions.
[328:44.96]I have a choice in this.
[328:48.95]Contact with victim.
[328:52.77]They kind of just got out of a flipped over car.
[328:55.29]Last night, you went drinking with a lady.
[328:58.40]Now she's dead.
[328:59.84]And your face is all messed up.
[329:01.68]I'm in the clear on that.
[329:03.30]She preferred a sailor.
[329:04.58]You can lay it off on him.
[329:06.29]Are we finished?
[329:17.98]I don't know.
[329:18.78]I mean, that... It looks like he's not telling the truth, but he could just be a weirdo.
[329:34.25]Oh, come on.
[329:37.85]Well...
[329:41.53]Do you want my partner to sap you?
[329:43.59]Tell us what we want to know.
[329:45.33]She was okay.
[329:46.67]Drunk.
[329:47.49]Pissed off at her old man, wanting to go dancing.
[329:50.19]I thought I'd ply her with a few drinks and get my end away.
[329:53.29]Looks like your salty had the same idea.
[329:57.56]A count of movements.
[330:00.14]So what happened when you left the bar?
[330:02.58]Sailor Boy laid one on me.
[330:04.24]A cheap shot.
[330:06.32]After that, I don't know.
[330:11.27]It's like getting into car accidents behind us.
[330:23.73]There's a car accident like every 10 seconds.
[330:27.66]Glass breaking.
[330:31.44]Beeping.
[330:35.38]How many cars are here?
[330:46.53]There are like 30 cars.
[330:51.42]Come on!
[330:52.20]If we're doing this, get it over with!
[330:55.50]Shut up, I'm listening.
[330:58.50]Is that it?
[331:04.58]Oh, no.
[331:08.48]It sort of just fell.
[331:09.40]It was just skydiving and landed behind us.
[331:23.70]Alright, that's it.
[331:32.64]He's going to fucking piss his pants.
[331:35.58]Is it a jackhammer?
[331:37.88]Why is there a construction?
[331:40.04]If we're doing this, get it over with.
[331:44.19]You've done time, haven't you, Richard?
[331:45.85]Funny car noise.
[331:46.85]I mean, come on.
[331:47.43]That's funny.
[331:47.91]There's nothing behind us.
[331:49.21]Sexual assault.
[331:50.94]Look, I was lying there on the sidewalk.
[331:53.74]He flags a cab and jumps in with the broad.
[331:55.38]There's nothing behind us.
[331:57.46]We're taking you in, Bates.
[331:58.98]How come?
[332:00.32]Just for a chat.
[332:01.76]Nice private chat.
[332:04.14]I'll explain my theory of once a degenerate officer... It's like one of those hearing tests.
[332:09.50]Take him to Central.
[332:10.70]He's a material witness in a murder case.
[332:12.82]Find him a cozy cell.
[332:14.22]Richard here knows the drill.
[332:26.42]Oh.
[332:28.42]It wasn't the car beeping that was making me laugh.
[332:31.28]It was the fucking, like, crashings and the people falling down and the jackhammer.
[332:39.29]Call 11 King to KGPL.
[332:40.79]I gotta call KGPL.
[332:41.99]Go ahead, 11 King.
[332:45.81]Oh, did I break the phone?
[332:47.51]No.
[332:49.91]I did, didn't I?
[332:51.17]But I'm not with him.
[333:02.78]What is going on here?
[333:10.41]Phelps, 1247.
[333:15.21]How can I help, detective?
[333:17.30]I need an APB out on a yellow cab, number 3591.
[333:20.62]Ask dispatch to relay all sightings to car 11K.
[333:24.32]No problem.
[333:25.18]I'll get on the radio.
[333:26.72]Are there any incident reports filed in the vicinity of Barron's Bar on North Beaudry Avenue?
[333:31.10]We're tracking a sailor who was involved in a fight outside the bar.
[333:34.92]I can check the reports, Detective.
[333:37.93]I have a message for you from Captain Donnelly.
[333:40.05]Message reads, James Jessup, U.S.
[333:42.45]Navy Able Seaman, has information relevant to your case.
[333:45.97]Jessup is currently being detained at Central Station.
[333:48.87]Okay.
[333:49.43]Could be our man.
[333:50.60]Thanks.
[333:52.28]Interrogate James Jessup at Central Police Station.
[333:57.66]What's your beef with this guy, Phelps?
[334:07.18]Alright.
[334:09.66]Station, Central Division.
[334:12.26]Let's go.
[334:12.66]Car 11K, we have a response on your APB regarding yellow cab number 3591.
[334:22.35]The vehicle has been identified at a gas station.
[334:29.38]Should I do that now?
[334:38.19]Follow the cat?
[334:38.81]I left my partner again.
[334:47.99]He wasn't fast enough to get in the car.
[335:00.41]I had to go now.
[335:01.33]Okay.
[335:01.57]This is the cab that she took, so I need to... I don't think this guy's the killer or anything.
[335:07.26]I just need to ask this guy where the girl went.
[335:09.48]Where's the cab?
[335:30.98]Cab?
[335:31.70]Did you see a cab?
[335:37.95]11K, further on your APB on yellow cab number 3591.
[335:46.02]Vehicle identified at Reggie's Cafe.
[335:49.76]Reggie's Cafe.
[335:50.70]It's right ahead.
[335:52.62]Found it.
[335:58.74]So what do I... Pull over.
[336:08.32]Will the guy pull over?
[336:09.82]Do I have to smash into him?
[336:17.56]Okay.
[336:20.94]Thank you for pulling over, sir.
[336:22.82]I really appreciate it.
[336:25.27]LAPD.
[336:26.16]We're investigating a murder.
[336:27.32]What's that got to do with me?
[336:28.78]The fairy you picked up from Baron's bar last night.
[336:31.02]What was the woman wearing?
[336:32.02]It was a green dress.
[336:34.78]Oh, don't tell me something's happened to her.
[336:36.58]Tell me about her.
[336:38.18]She was with this sailor.
[336:39.96]He was all over her.
[336:42.02]Really animated.
[336:43.24]Said she just wanted to dance.
[336:45.39]But he had that look in his eye.
[336:47.85]Where did you drop them off?
[336:50.50]Officer needs help.
[336:51.54]Oh, don't.
[336:52.30]Okay, fine.
[336:52.84]Let's do it.
[337:17.44]Sorry, I just ruined your day even more.
[337:18.87]Can we fit through this person's house?
[337:21.66]Calm down!
[337:22.42]What instrument is that?
[337:23.66]The kazoo?
[337:59.79]Easy!
[338:02.27]Trumpet with, oh yeah, it's the trumpet with one of those things, you know.
[338:13.66]The plunger.
[338:15.68]Trumpet with a toilet plunger.
[338:16.86]I'm going.
[338:18.10]I'm gonna go.
[338:26.26]This is 11k.
[338:27.16]We'll handle the 415.
[338:28.82]Jesus, Phelps!
[338:48.47]Who clogged the trumpet?
[338:50.13]You can't trump- You can't trumpet that.
[338:52.81]You can't jump over this.
[338:55.41]Oh my god, please.
[339:05.22]Why don't you come on out, Jimmy?
[339:07.08]I won't let them hurt you.
[339:08.16]Honey boy.
[339:08.82]Not my honey boy.
[339:10.86]I told you not to call me that, woman!
[339:12.90]Now shut the hell up!
[339:14.94]You shut the hell up!
[339:17.45]Is that the lady of the house?
[339:21.92]It's a nice story.
[339:23.22]Two old lovebirds just moved in together.
[339:25.44]But they had a falling out, and he chased her across the yard with a 12-gauge.
[339:29.60]Now it's him or us.
[339:31.40]Is this funny to you, rookie?
[339:32.33]You think that's funny?
[339:34.89]You gonna laugh at me, smirk at that?
[339:36.71]Hit the basket.
[339:39.29]Officer down.
[339:42.77]Give yourself up.
[339:44.39]Now.
[339:45.25]Swine.
[339:46.27]Look out.
[339:55.84]I want it to just be one, two, three clean shots.
[340:04.61]Just one, two, three.
[340:06.33]We've all tried to run in the... Oh.
[340:08.19]Oh, that was in my voice.
[340:10.77]Okay, I don't... No fucking that up again.
[340:13.48]Why is it gone?
[340:24.73]Oh, damn it.
[340:27.57]Oh well.
[340:29.69]Yeah, we were the NPCs at that point, you're right.
[340:32.39]Well, uh... Never mind.
[340:44.35]You did not press X. I didn't really have an option to.
[340:47.70]I was trying to run in there and punch him.
[340:50.50]Why does it keep popping up and then disappearing?
[340:52.22]See that?
[340:53.08]Why did it do that?
[340:53.84]Is it still possible to do it?
[340:55.78]It's down here, right?
[340:57.26]Come on, what is it?
[341:20.09]Had to go to the same place.
[341:26.31]I don't really remember either the map here.
[341:31.69]Let's go do the mission.
[341:41.25]Ooby dooby dooby.
[341:42.17]Alright, interrogation.
[341:47.08]He's in interview two.
[341:49.06]Thanks.
[341:49.96]What do you make of him?
[341:50.90]Sailor on furlough who looks like he's in trouble and knows it.
[341:55.71]Straight through the red light.
[341:56.99]Said she never saw it.
[341:57.69]Why did you come to California to be a second girl?
[342:05.09]Detectives Phelps and Galloway, we know why you're here, Jessup.
[342:08.85]So it would be best if you answered our questions truthfully.
[342:12.48]I don't want any trouble, that's why I'm here.
[342:14.04]I heard on the radio about this lady getting killed.
[342:16.68]I got leave from my CO to come down straight away.
[342:19.65]So why did you kill her?
[342:21.83]I didn't kill anyone.
[342:24.17]Look, you need to believe me.
[342:25.91]Let's start at the beginning.
[342:29.98]Contact a U.S.
[342:32.70]maybe able seaman seen with victim on night of murder.
[342:36.46]You went to Baron's bar.
[342:38.08]What time did you arrive?
[342:39.70]I got a 24-hour pass.
[342:41.16]I got there around 7.
[342:42.42]That's where you met Teresa Terrelson?
[342:45.26]Sure.
[342:46.20]We had a couple of drinks.
[342:52.87]So you tried to make a woman who was incredibly drunk?
[342:55.91]Look, I'm not proud of myself, but I never hurt her.
[342:59.74]You took her dancing?
[343:00.96]That's right.
[343:02.08]We caught a cab to the Crystal Ballroom.
[343:05.24]That's true.
[343:07.34]Right?
[343:07.66]You had a fist fight with Richard Bates over Mrs. Terrelson.
[343:11.55]You met the guy?
[343:12.71]He's a creep.
[343:14.25]You should take a look at him for this.
[343:20.70]I mean, he's pointing the finger directly at you, Jessup.
[343:23.84]I only had one night before I was back in the tub.
[343:26.68]He had all the time in the world to look for some action.
[343:28.85]I belted him.
[343:29.69]I'd do it again.
[343:31.15]She was better off with me.
[343:32.75]Sure.
[343:33.57]You're a shining example of chivalry, Jessup.
[343:38.07]Movements prior to murder.
[343:39.89]Where did you go after the crystal ball broke?
[343:43.21]I think the wind had gone out of her sails by then.
[343:46.27]She caught a cab and I caught a bus back to the base.
[343:54.72]Oh, they started shaky at first, but... Oh, no.
[344:02.52]They're not... It's not... He can't only... No.
[344:07.85]We spoke to the cab driver.
[344:09.85]Tell us what really happened at the crystal ballroom.
[344:14.33]I'd had enough.
[344:15.75]She was all upset about her husband bawling about her kids.
[344:18.93]She looked old.
[344:20.71]Left around closing, maybe 1.30.
[344:23.45]Got on a bus and she fell asleep on my shoulder.
[344:26.07]Which bus?
[344:26.39]Which only told lies.
[344:27.79]An all-American, 249.
[344:28.95]He hasn't said anything else besides a lie.
[344:30.93]Went past her place.
[344:32.04]She jumped off and I stayed on it downtown.
[344:34.74]Is that also a lie?
[344:35.16]After that, I caught another bus to San Pedro.
[344:37.12]So that's probably also not true.
[344:38.04]Indiana's down there.
[344:38.64]She's being scrapped.
[344:40.12]And that was the last you saw of Teresa?
[344:42.36]Yeah, that's right.
[344:44.13]We didn't say much.
[344:44.91]I think she was kind of embarrassed.
[344:49.87]Cab ride.
[344:50.49]But is that... Is that his... Okay, so this is... He's telling the truth.
[344:54.21]Look at how confident he is right there.
[345:00.19]Really?
[345:01.13]So...
[345:19.50]Wait a minute.
[345:20.50]Can I, like, accuse with the cab?
[345:32.53]Tire tracks?
[345:36.76]Well, okay, the first three questions, he was like, his eyes were darting around, and now all of a sudden he's, like, smiling.
[345:49.13]Tell the truth, Jessup.
[345:50.49]You were running out of time.
[345:51.93]You wanted to get laid and Theresa wouldn't come across.
[345:54.65]It made you crazy, so you strangled her with a piece of rope.
[345:58.83]For Christ's sake, that's not true.
[346:01.95]I felt sorry for her.
[346:03.27]What proof do you have that I strangled her?
[346:11.31]The cab statement.
[346:15.87]We got you...
[346:18.17]In the cab.
[346:20.51]That's the proof we have.
[346:21.61]You took a cab.
[346:22.41]Wait, I can back out.
[346:24.21]I made a mistake.
[346:26.15]You can actually do that?
[346:28.33]Oh, okay.
[346:29.29]So the last thing you wanted was her playing hard to get.
[346:32.23]Did that make you mad, sailor?
[346:34.01]So every single thing?
[346:36.55]She knew what a guy's looking for.
[346:37.79]All broads do.
[346:39.12]Dancing comes second.
[346:40.58]And what happened at the crystal ballroom?
[346:43.37]Nothing.
[346:44.33]Not even a little hand relief.
[346:46.01]She had another couple of drinks.
[346:47.35]There was no fun left in her.
[346:49.13]Just poured her guts out to some bartender.
[346:52.75]We're holding you till we can clear this with the driver.
[346:54.75]He literally was... Yeah, my CO said as much.
[346:57.77]Didn't tell the truth every time.
[347:00.23]Can you put the guy in two in a cell and inform the commander?
[347:03.03]Sure, detective.
[347:04.09]Okay.
[347:07.56]Got a message for you.
[347:09.04]Sighting of your disfigured hobo on Grand between Temple and Sunset.
[347:12.94]And it looks like the bow has a wrecker, too.
[347:15.00]He's wanted in connection with two female assault.
[347:17.77]Thanks.
[347:20.37]What now?
[347:21.25]Drive all the way to San Pedro and check his locker?
[347:23.65]Didn't we already do a hobo camp?
[347:24.43]Let's see if the bus story checks out.
[347:26.53]There's a depot at 1660 Beverly Boulevard.
[347:31.26]Investigate interstate bus depot.
[347:37.08]Three suspects in the can and one on the hoof.
[347:40.06]Still no hard evidence on any of them.
[347:43.72]KGPL to car 11K.
[347:45.22]11K, come in.
[347:48.51]Watch it, will ya?
[347:50.55]11K, go ahead.
[347:52.11]Let's go.
[347:52.53]I thought we were gonna make some tuna fish out of this.
[348:04.80]11K, Roger that.
[348:05.52]Only have time to get that tactical.
[348:08.62]It's possible.
[348:10.05]Have them bring him in.
[348:10.99]I was talking about Teeter earlier.
[348:13.03]We have Lars Pereltson picked up.
[348:34.18]Tuna fish sandwich is awesome?
[348:35.20]Oh, I love it.
[348:39.64]I could arguably say that I could eat tuna fish every single day.
[348:43.23]I probably could.
[348:49.27]Satan, like, appears in front of me and is like, You can only eat tuna fish for the rest of your life.
[348:55.32]How do you plead?
[348:55.92]And I'm like, Guilty!
[349:00.65]I'd do it What kind of trial is that?
[349:29.90]alright bus stop flip for somebody and thank you ma'am you have a safe trip now where are you boys headed today lapd we're after the driver of all-American 249 would have been around midnight onwards last night uh just a minute do you like raw tuna I do
[349:54.40]Spicy tuna is probably my favorite roll at a sushi restaurant.
[349:58.29]I don't eat it that often, but...
[350:12.94]I like raw tuna in a spicy tuna roll, but I don't like raw tuna just eating raw tuna.
[350:19.48]I know a lot of people really like that, but not for me.
[350:23.96]It's got to be in something else.
[350:29.41]I'll need to run the loop.
[350:32.15]Locate All-American 74.
[350:33.73]Route number 74.
[350:35.09]Do I have to memorize this, or is this going to be on the map?
[350:41.06]We're not going to drive the whole thing, are we?
[350:43.80]Won't take long.
[350:45.12]We have a siren.
[350:47.90]Um... Okay.
[350:54.07]Wait.
[351:01.49]I can't decide between the tuna fish and the chicken.
[351:04.63]Ha!
[351:05.97]Tuna!
[351:07.39]Eat the tuna.
[351:08.03]That's the best one.
[351:17.75]Novels?
[351:25.19]I'm out the back door, goddammit.
[351:45.82]Alright, so we just have to drive this line.
[351:50.04]Okay.
[351:52.64]You get in the car.
[351:53.66]Like, he's never in the car with me.
[351:55.04]Shit!
[351:58.78]I'm just too fast for this guy.
[352:03.96]Get in.
[352:09.12]Okay.
[352:11.44]Looking for a bus.
[352:13.58]This could be a long trip, Cole.
[352:17.48]Or it could be a short one.
[352:18.84]And here's me without my hip flask and only a pain in the ass for company.
[352:23.27]Way to kick off the drive in high spirits, Rusty.
[352:25.93]Comments like that put me in just the right mood for some legwork.
[352:29.27]Touchy.
[352:30.11]You know what your problem is?
[352:31.51]You don't like hard work.
[352:32.51]Don't find the bus.
[352:33.21]This kind of rigorous search is what police work is all about.
[352:36.64]Discipline.
[352:37.76]How big is the bus?
[352:38.88]You're just as bored as I am.
[352:41.66]I'm not sure I've seen a bus the whole game.
[352:48.54]Let alone try to find one now.
[352:52.38]Uh...
[353:18.94]Well, I'm currently driving with traffic, so that might be a problem.
[353:22.74]If so are they.
[353:23.56]Nope, still no sign of him.
[353:33.11]Did you doze off, Rusty?
[353:34.85]I think you slept through my solving the case.
[353:37.07]Yeah, yeah, very funny.
[353:38.17]Just give me a nudge if you see him, alright?
[353:40.15]How about you nudge me?
[353:41.34]Found him.
[353:41.62]That's a job for your wife.
[353:42.78]Oh, Rusty.
[353:46.63]That's the bus we're looking for.
[353:48.15]Ease in behind her and get her to the side of the road.
[353:51.07]Alright.
[353:51.49]Hello?
[354:10.91]Is there some kind of problem, buddy?
[354:12.17]LAPD.
[354:13.90]We're investigating a murder.
[354:15.62]You had a sailor and a woman in a green dress on your bus late last night?
[354:19.08]That's correct.
[354:20.14]And the woman got off first around 2 a.m.?
[354:22.63]Yeah, that's right.
[354:23.89]And the sailor stayed on all the way to downtown.
[354:26.27]Can you tell us where you let the woman off?
[354:28.19]On California Street.
[354:30.29]To tell you the truth, she looked a little lost, like she got off on the wrong stop or something.
[354:34.59]This voice.
[354:35.56]I didn't like dropping her off near that hobo camp.
[354:37.90]Who is this voice?
[354:38.46]It's been a big help, Mr. Zeffirelli.
[354:40.56]I've heard it a million times.
[354:47.76]So Sailor Boy escaped by the seat of his bell-bottom trousers and left the broad alive.
[354:52.80]Left her by the hobo camp?
[354:55.00]Which means he's as good as killed.
[354:56.54]We can't eliminate any of them, but the disfigured man should be our starting point.
[355:01.48]I'm going to call for some backup.
[355:02.90]These bows hate cops.
[355:05.22]These bows hate cops.
[355:07.28]Okay, so we're going to go to the hobo camp.
[355:14.06]This is a long one.
[355:21.60]Breathe, Falcon.
[355:22.76]Breathe, damn it.
[355:26.17]Danny DeVito Danny DeVito who are you getting that
[355:52.15]No.
[355:54.01]No.
[355:55.47]No.
[355:56.87]I'm about to go to the hobo camp.
[356:05.94]Too busy right now, sorry.
[356:07.58]Cole!
[356:28.62]Is it weird that I don't like to have the song?
[356:29.90]Because I think it's too loud.
[356:33.10]It's annoying.
[356:41.36]I'd rather deal with driving into people.
[356:49.06]Nice dodge.
[356:58.27]There's some lightning reflexes there.
[357:18.06]LAPD.
[357:20.06]We'd like a word with you.
[357:20.96]Save it for someone who's interested.
[357:23.58]They have a fire axe?
[357:25.32]Um... Beat up the main guy.
[357:26.70]I've seen every movie, I've seen every TV show, every video game.
[357:30.62]Once you beat up the fucking boss, everybody else stops.
[357:52.88]and they change their mind instantly.
[357:56.14]Get your filthy hands off me, you bum.
[358:06.67]I've seen every movie and every video game.
[358:09.37]Yeah.
[358:09.61]Every single one.
[358:11.21]Every single one.
[358:36.24]The Kremlin's over here, Phelps.
[358:38.08]Toss it.
[358:39.00]Name one that came out three years and two days ago.
[358:44.10]Well, I mean, you gotta be specific.
[358:46.02]A movie or a TV show or a video game.
[358:49.24]Dude, what are you talking about?
[358:52.23]Come on.
[358:59.99]Still working, Jack.
[359:01.85]I'm off to the Lighthouse Club in Santa Monica.
[359:05.90]Hello, Jack.
[359:09.14]Mr. Benson, this is Courtney Sheldon.
[359:11.64]He's a buddy of mine from the war.
[359:12.94]Well, I'm sure you two will want to polish some old war stories.
[359:16.88]Good evening, Jack.
[359:18.30]Mr. Sheldon.
[359:20.38]Good night, sir.
[359:23.12]Take a seat, Courtney.
[359:30.42]We need your help, Jack.
[359:32.70]What?
[359:33.84]I told you I would have nothing to do with that.
[359:38.76]I'm fine too, Jack.
[359:40.40]Medical school's going well.
[359:42.42]I got a part-time job.
[359:44.64]Do dope peddlers need part-time jobs?
[359:47.82]We made a mistake and we're in trouble, Jack.
[359:50.87]A local gangster, Mickey Cohen, is putting on the squeeze.
[359:55.87]So hand it over.
[359:56.87]Walk away.
[359:57.65]What's stopping you?
[359:58.71]We had a deal with them that they would dole it out slowly.
[360:02.81]They said they would supply abortion clinics and doctors.
[360:06.88]But they've been moving it onto addicts.
[360:08.87]And they can't cope with the purity.
[360:10.27]So your problem is with gangsters being dishonest.
[360:12.99]My problem is that people are dying.
[360:15.47]And if this gets back to us, we'll all end up in jail.
[360:20.83]So how am I supposed to help, Courtney?
[360:23.37]This isn't the war.
[360:24.23]I can't just wave a magic wand and clean up your mess.
[360:33.07]We want you to negotiate, Jack.
[360:39.59]The only thing these guys understand is force, Sheldon.
[360:43.65]They got to the top back east by proving to be more vicious than the English, the Irish, and the Dutch.
[360:48.81]They make their own laws.
[360:50.35]That's the nature of society.
[360:51.63]For God's sake, Courtney, you want to be a doctor.
[360:58.29]Give me another one.
[360:58.87]How can you fight with that?
[361:01.85]Give me another year for the day.
[361:08.37]I didn't make it through the war to come back to this kind of shit, Sheldon.
[361:42.94]16 years ago, four days.
[361:43.68]Nightmare before Christmas.
[361:52.97]Wait, I need to look in here.
[361:53.79]There's none of these ropes.
[362:10.38]Three years ago.
[362:11.02]Shaun of the Dead.
[362:11.99]Purse.
[362:12.15]Last Friday.
[362:12.43]Venom.
[362:47.82]Mitt 1 interrogates Stuart Ackerman.
[363:22.49]Two years, six months ago.
[363:28.45]Ah, damn.
[363:29.23]That's got me, though.
[363:30.77]Oh, two years and six.
[363:32.39]It's the six months that's getting me.
[363:35.32]The husband has an alibi, but no real motive other than neglect.
[363:39.16]The Annabelle prequel.
[363:39.88]Annabelle 4, whatever it was.
[363:40.88]Annabelle 4, the doll is back.
[363:41.66]You're gonna kill us!
[363:53.22]We have the evidence.
[363:54.42]We know she was here.
[363:55.96]All we need is a confession and we can charge the bum with murder.
[364:10.94]What's the joke he's doing here?
[364:12.40]I mean... I'm just saying when movies came out... Alright, fine.
[364:21.15]You guys think you're so smart?
[364:23.84]Let's go.
[364:24.24]If you take more than five seconds here, then you googled it.
[364:27.86]When did the Mighty Ducks come out?
[364:31.82]The first one.
[364:40.89]We're going this way.
[364:46.79]I don't even know.
[364:51.48]I don't know.
[364:52.98]No guns?
[364:57.80]Where's the interrogation room?
[365:03.58]Follow interview room one.
[365:06.84]Ackerman, you were in the Marines.
[365:08.60]How do you know?
[365:10.16]The Corps selected big guys for flamethrower duty.
[365:13.26]That's how you got the burns.
[365:15.31]Somebody actually got it.
[365:16.35]Okay, how about this one, guys?
[365:17.33]Willard.
[365:17.73]I need a year and a day.
[365:48.35]Okay.
[365:49.41]Nice job.
[365:50.03]Why did you kill Mrs. Terrelson?
[365:53.19]I have no recollection of the people I have killed.
[365:56.77]Lie.
[365:57.29]Lie.
[365:57.80]Lie.
[366:00.74]You hate women, Ackerman?
[366:04.58]More than you could ever imagine.
[366:07.46]How much did you hate Mrs. Terrelson?
[366:10.78]I ache to put my seed in them.
[366:13.59]I have no use for them.
[366:18.14]Okay.
[366:20.66]So... So you did it.
[366:24.93]A bus driver dropped Mrs. Terrelson near your camp around 2 a.m.
[366:28.65]Why did you take her up to the hill?
[366:30.55]Which hill?
[366:32.49]I have many places.
[366:34.27]I go where I please.
[366:41.45]You are clearly insane, Ackerman.
[366:43.57]The state of California does not execute mental patients.
[366:46.63]I don't know the names of the women I've killed, but I've killed many of them.
[366:51.33]So this is the guy.
[366:52.17]Their necks are so fragile.
[366:55.23]This is the guy.
[366:55.93]This is the dude.
[366:56.72]He's the guy that's killing all the people.
[367:02.70]Where were you around 2 a.m.
[367:04.10]last night?
[367:05.48]At the camp.
[367:09.52]Hold on.
[367:09.86]What do we got?
[367:12.62]2 a.m.
[367:13.80]at the camp.
[367:14.34]We brought her up there.
[367:15.90]Laundry.
[367:16.45]Boots.
[367:16.73]What about his shoe size?
[367:29.63]The rope.
[367:30.49]The boat, though.
[367:40.20]Where are the tire tracks?
[367:43.86]Turn tire tracks on muddy ground close to body.
[367:46.31]This guy didn't have a car.
[368:03.46]Bus driver Frank testifies to dropping Teresa near the camp.
[368:08.37]rope matching picture mark on victim's neck found in ackerman's lean-to and this is found in stuart ackerman's lean-to her purse and the rope that killed her so wouldn't it be like the rope that killed her
[368:38.35]I mean, that's obvious.
[368:40.59]I wanted you to take one of the other ones away.
[368:51.54]You were up on the hill.
[368:53.08]You were seen during the day.
[368:54.24]We have a witness.
[368:55.00]We have evidence.
[368:55.86]Come clean with me, Ackerman, and I'll see what I can do for you.
[368:59.91]I despise your pity.
[369:01.99]You have nothing that links me to this woman.
[369:08.10]Did he get rid of the rope?
[369:10.66]Oh, shit.
[369:15.25]It's not his boots.
[369:16.67]He doesn't have a car.
[369:24.52]This is the only other thing.
[369:26.74]But, just... I was gonna say the rope.
[369:32.47]We have you cold, Ackerman.
[369:34.25]Her purse and the ballroom ticket were in your lean-to.
[369:37.69]Tell us why you did it.
[369:39.75]I kill because people need killing.
[369:43.15]It's what I was trained to do.
[369:47.81]Stuart Ackerman!
[369:48.55]Yeah!
[369:49.22]I am charging you with the murder of Theresa Teraldson.
[370:00.76]Did he do all the other ones, too, then?
[370:12.64]He's innocent.
[370:14.10]I don't believe so.
[370:14.70]Hey, thanks.
[370:50.08]Oh.
[370:50.36]15 out of 17.
[370:53.90]The Tarletons might have justice if Stuart Ackerman is pronounced fit to stand trial.
[371:10.90]I feel like the last two crimes were two crazy people that were like, I did it.
[371:16.96]It was me.
[371:17.72]You know what I mean?
[371:28.81]And now my heart's blazing when you say that.
[371:38.95]Where did I fall for the trick?
[371:40.26]The studio secretary murder will have to be for another time.
[372:09.21]Maybe tomorrow.
[372:14.94]It's getting late.
[372:19.88]We'll see how it starts, though.
[372:24.20]And again, we got to see his face this time.
[372:32.81]Of course we will look into it.
[372:35.79]Yes, I'm aware that it's an election year.
[372:39.41]Keep a hold of your hat, Counselor.
[372:41.59]Now is not the time to lose your nerve.
[372:46.06]It would appear that someone has hocked a rose gold wedding ring, a matching engagement ring.
[372:51.52]Sound familiar?
[372:52.50]Deirdre Muller.
[372:53.80]Press the pawn broker and see what you can find out.
[372:57.04]The address is 348 South Main Street.
[373:00.42]The Muller case goes before the grand jury next week, and the DA does not want any egg on his face.
[373:05.68]Then get out to the railroad depot on Santa Fe Avenue.
[373:09.38]We have another poor unfortunate found this morning beside a railroad line.
[373:12.94]Yeah, at what point is it like... Right, Skipper.
[373:17.14]This is a serial killer.
[373:20.29]My partner just doesn't seem to want to connect those dots.
[373:23.79]No, it's all just coincidences.
[373:26.55]Steve's taking the wedding rings and slitting their throats and choking them with... Another body.
[373:31.65]And Deirdre Muller's ring.
[373:32.71]Alright.
[373:36.47]That is going to be it for tonight.

[375:57.21]See you tomorrow.
[375:59.63]And let me drop that out of the way.
[376:05.29]Let's head back here.
[376:08.67]To six hours ago now.
[376:11.93]Toshiro Ati.
[376:14.38]Thank you for the one dollar.
[376:16.72]Well, I'd watch the stream, but unfortunately I have schoolwork to do.
[376:19.18]At any rate, I'm glad you settled and it seems like you're really beginning to enjoy yourself and relax.
[376:23.71]I am.
[376:24.91]I am.
[376:25.51]Things are looking, things are looking up.
[376:29.20]Glad to be back.
[376:30.32]And back in the swing of things.
[376:31.34]So, thank you, Toshi.
[376:33.34]Thank you, GarfieldTheMondayKiller, for the $1.
[376:35.30]Early Garfield bits.
[376:37.24]Yeah, very early.
[376:38.22]Right at the beginning.
[376:39.86]Welcome to the Garfield party, Jerm.
[376:40.98]I'm actually at my Toonversity taking an online test.
[376:45.58]But I'm donating bits to you instead.
[376:48.86]There was a funny Sunday comic that was released on Thursday.
[376:52.87]Anyway, Jerm...
[377:00.55]If you... If you were to take every Garfield roleplay comment that's happened so far, I'm pretty sure it's getting to be book level here.
[377:18.00]I think we're getting to be at book level.
[377:25.40]Oh, did we drop some frames?
[377:26.30]Yeah, we're fine, though.
[377:30.67]Jim Davis already has 10 books.
[377:32.71]At what point is GarfieldTheMondayKiller going to have the same amount of content as Jim Davis published?
[377:42.79]I think we're getting there pretty soon.
[377:47.12]But anyways, that just was a thought that jumped up into my brain there.
[377:52.64]Anyways, remember to look on that rootin' hootin' tootin' high flutin' noisy shootin' Red Dead.
[377:56.88]Oh wait, you're playing L.A.
[377:58.83]Noire.
[378:00.57]I am playing L.A.
[378:01.19]Noire.
[378:04.25]We'll see what we do tomorrow, though.
[378:08.21]Thank you, GarfieldTheMondayKiller.
[378:12.13]If you shed out one book every year, you'll be on your way.
[378:18.35]Thank you, Brilliant Fungi, for the ten bucks.
[378:22.93]Thank you.
[378:26.68]Bring back JermaCraft.
[378:30.27]I did.
[378:30.59]I already did.
[378:31.21]I did for one day only.
[378:37.09]That was a one day only special.
[378:40.15]And I had to drink two full bottles of champagne to do it.
[378:45.99]But thank you, Brilliant Fungi, for the $10.
[378:49.09]Appreciate it.
[378:51.85]I hit 5k on that stream.
[378:53.60]I know.
[378:55.48]On a Minecraft stream.
[378:58.89]But thanks a lot, man.
[378:59.89]Thank you, DivUSP, for the $4.
[379:01.47]No message, thank you.
[379:04.17]$4.
[379:08.25]Logei, thanks for the $1.
[379:10.99]Thank you.
[379:12.61]SmarkyMC, thanks for the $5.
[379:14.27]Hey, Jerma, first time donating.
[379:16.94]Just wanted to thank you for being a light during these rather dark times.
[379:23.16]Thank you, Smarky, for giving $5 here.
[379:29.06]But you appreciate it.
[379:29.72]I don't know how long you've been around, but I'm glad to be here.
[379:37.82]Thank you, Smarky, for the five bucks.
[379:42.80]Anything else show official?
[379:45.70]Thank you for the $4.
[379:47.88]Anything else?
[379:49.85]They say, I wanted to gift you more money for all the later productions, streams, and jokes.

[381:18.91]Okay, buy.
[381:20.23]And then they came back with $5.
[381:22.69]And they said, hey, why not?

[381:24.49]Buy yourself something else.
[381:25.71]Why don't you?
[381:29.73]I will buy something.

[382:19.84]Much love to you guys.
[382:21.50]Free iPod.
[382:22.22]Thanks for the $1.
[382:25.03]They're shushing.
[382:25.75]They're saying epic is an epic word.
[382:31.35]I guess.
[382:32.97]Hawkeye of mine again gave $19.
[382:34.75]So that puts you up there, man.
[382:40.58]You also gave $12 like not even 20 minutes ago.
[382:42.50]So that's $66 here.
[382:49.14]Thank you so much, dude.
[382:51.37]This one for $19 says, Hey, that's the Nutribullet, ain't it?
[382:55.75]My 62-year-old mother loves that too.
[383:00.73]It's actually the Ninja.
[383:03.67]But yes, they are the same product as marketed on different infomercials.
[383:09.86]Same exact concept.
[383:10.88]And it's so easy to use.
[383:11.86]It really is.
[383:13.56]You just blend it and you turn it upside down, take the top off and drink out of it.
[383:23.64]Sponsored.
[383:26.55]Sponsored by Ninja.
[383:29.07]No, not quite.
[383:30.43]But thanks a lot, man.
[383:32.07]FortMinerGuy, thanks for the $5.
[383:34.41]Best streamer to date.
[383:36.03]I'm glad you think that.
[383:40.36]Thank you for the $5 and that incredibly nice thing to say.
[383:45.42]I'mMan44, thanks for the $1.
[383:46.88]Jerma, have you ever tried playing the fighting fantasy books on stream?
[383:52.67]No, because the fighting fantasy books are very complicated, and I don't know if they transition well to being on video, because it's an actual book in DICE, and it would be very, very hard for me to learn that and stream it at the same time.
[384:08.34]I just, I don't know if that would be good stream content.
[384:14.95]But, if you're curious, fighting fantasy is the sorcery, it's made by the same person.
[384:23.47]I'm curious of what they're asking here.
[384:26.97]But thank you.
[384:27.73]I just don't think it would transition well.
[384:33.51]But thank you, iMan, for the $1.
[384:35.97]Thank you, TheLongEgg, for the $5 here.
[384:39.79]Thank you, LongEgg.
[384:40.45]I have surgery at 6 a.m.
[384:41.59]tomorrow, and having you stream tonight is helping me out a lot.
[384:44.43]You're amazing, and I can't wait for the green screen stream.
[384:46.89]Neither can I. It should be a ton of fun.
[384:51.03]It's happening pretty soon.
[384:53.90]I'll let you guys know the exact date, but I need to lock it down for either this weekend, like I said, or probably Monday or Tuesday.
[385:01.13]But good luck on your surgery.
[385:02.87]I'm not sure if it's anything that's serious or a difficult surgery or anything, but good luck to you.
[385:12.40]Wish you the best.
[385:12.92]Thank you so much for the five dollars.
[385:20.26]Uh, we also have... Hawkeye of mine gave the $12 earlier.
[385:23.92]Yeah, on top of all the other money.
[385:27.74]But for the $12 message here is... Well, here's for my next bit badge, and I'm super stoked to have gotten to see the L.A.
[385:33.85]Noire streams come back.
[385:35.57]You're getting graded interrogations.
[385:37.03]Have a good one, Jerma, and I love all the germs in chat.
[385:41.49]Thank you, Hawkeye.
[385:42.05]Appreciate it.
[385:46.00]Thank you so much for $69. $69.
[385:52.44]Thank you.
[385:53.80]And I think I'm getting the hang of it.
[385:56.06]Once I figured out that you just have to find the thing, the one thing, it's not like, oh, I investigated the crime scene.
[386:02.16]I have to talk about all those things.
[386:06.17]I get it.
[386:07.41]It's a lot of fun.
[386:09.81]Thank you so much, Hawkeye.
[386:10.71]Thank you, Wavelet, for the $4.20.
[386:12.59]Dremahart, thank you, Wavelet. $4.20.
[386:20.48]Did it say jermaHeart, nothing else?
[386:22.90]Uh, Kyrenski, thanks for the one dollar.
[386:25.76]Jerma, go back and watch Rat Movie 2 real quick.
[386:29.14]That video was uploaded on my birthday, and my name is Michael, and I couldn't have asked for a better gift in case you don't read resub messages.
[386:38.13]Uh, I would be breaking my number one rule, unfortunately, uh, Kyrenski.
[386:42.95]I don't, I will not watch Rat Movie on stream.
[386:48.19]Go watch it quick.
[386:51.84]But... All the sad faces.
[386:58.02]You already did.
[386:58.68]You didn't know it.
[386:59.22]When did I do that?
[387:02.57]Well, listen, Michael.
[387:04.79]It's your birthday today.
[387:06.05]Cake and ice cream is on its way.
[387:08.67]And, uh, Michael, you've been such a good boy this year.
[387:11.95]You're gonna open up your gifts while we all cheer.
[387:16.75]Celebrate another... Celebrate another one of Birthday Bash.
[387:19.17]Celebrate another one of Birthday Bash.
[387:20.73]There you go.
[387:23.54]Rat movie anniversary stream or we're going to revolt.
[387:29.12]But no, happy birthday.
[387:31.78]Was I shit-faced when we watched it?
[387:36.88]I had to have been, right?
[387:41.70]How do you still have it memorized?
[387:44.61]It's only like four lines and I recorded it.
[387:50.05]How the hell do you remember that thing that was three sentences that you recorded?
[387:54.19]It was on the Wasp stream?
[388:03.30]You're always drunk when you stream.
[388:04.92]That's your gimmick.
[388:06.12]Never.
[388:07.04]Ever.
[388:08.60]Maybe like once every two months.
[388:11.68]Once every like two or three months, I'll have a couple of drinks.
[388:16.15]Or drink two bottles of champagne, or like a bottle of liquor, like for Labo.
[388:20.59]Look, it happens sometimes.
[388:28.82]Once every month you aren't drunk.
[388:31.80]Holy lord.
[388:34.08]But happy birthday, Karinsky.
[388:39.56]Redheadorama, thanks for the $1.
[388:41.05]I love all your content.
[388:41.85]I usually just watch VODs and videos, but I popped in to say keep it up.
[388:45.37]You're great.
[388:45.91]Seems good.
[388:47.23]Thank you, Redheadorama.
[388:48.95]Glad you can enjoy watching the streams even when they're not live.
[388:53.58]Or the videos that are on the Tekken channel.
[388:57.38]Thank you for even participating at all.
[388:59.30]Thank you.
[389:00.86]And it's good to see you again.
[389:03.68]We don't talk about the Labo streams.
[389:05.40]Well, I had fun.
[389:08.50]My favorite take from the Labo streams was the first night that I did it, I was getting, I was like drunk and I was having a ton of fun.
[389:16.49]And then the next time it was like, people were yelling at me and people being very mean to me and I wasn't drunk.
[389:22.86]And somebody said, dude, you were just having fun the first night and we weren't, and you just didn't care because you were drunk.
[389:29.04]And I was laughing my ass off about it.
[389:30.38]Like I'm having so much fun.
[389:32.82]And everyone's like, this is awful.
[389:37.41]Not everybody.
[389:38.33]Just like 20% of everybody.
[389:43.14]I would do it again too.
[389:43.94]I'm not even kidding.
[389:44.78]If there was another Labo, I would build it tomorrow.
[389:48.44]Just wait until the stupid car comes out.
[389:50.76]And I'd do that again for like 8 hours.
[389:57.62]I'm going to do it again.
[390:00.00]But this time I'm going to do it like in the wind.
[390:03.00]I'll go on location and try to build the Labo on some mountain in Nevada.
[390:09.40]Like, just extreme winds and try to do it.
[390:19.93]But, thank you.
[390:21.51]Thank you, Hawkeye of Mine, again, for $3.
[390:23.15]Your stream's addictive, man.
[390:27.13]I gave my goodbye bits but stuck around, so here's the rest of my pocket change.
[390:30.52]Again, love you and all the germs here, too.
[390:35.20]I just, I'm just glad you're having fun.
[390:39.12]I'm happy that you can sit here and enjoy it.
[390:42.34]Because I enjoy it too.
[390:46.37]It's out right now.
[390:48.83]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[390:49.59]The vehicle kit is out right now.
[390:54.23]Okay.
[390:55.91]I know what we're doing.
[390:56.95]I know what we're doing this, like, weekend after the green screen stream.
[391:03.11]It came out in September.
[391:04.41]Oh, boy.
[391:05.07]Okay.
[391:11.80]You shouldn't have told me that.
[391:13.52]I'm going to be the only guy on Twitch that's built them all.
[391:20.40]Do you recommend any RPGs?
[391:21.70]Absolutely.
[391:22.30]Chrono Trigger.
[391:23.49]Super Mario RPG.
[391:26.73]Lost Odyssey.
[391:28.87]Um...
[391:31.29]Chrono Cross, except not really.
[391:33.23]You really have to be into it.
[391:34.21]That's pretty much it.
[391:42.80]Undertale, that's good too.
[391:45.34]Just don't ever type Undertale into Google because you'll... Just play it.
[391:49.19]Just play it and don't go look up anything.
[391:52.81]Just enjoy it for what it is.
[391:57.84]Sounds like I'll be playing some of those.
[391:59.16]Oh, they're some of the best RPGs ever made.
[392:01.62]Lost Odyssey, not so much, but that's just like a recent one that came out on Xbox, and it was pretty good.
[392:09.15]But Dark Soul, thank you for the $2, Dark Soul.
[392:11.43]Hey, Jeremy, you're my first sub and donation ever.
[392:13.95]And when I make more money, I will happily donate more.
[392:16.01]You've been through so many phases in my life, from when I was at my lower points to my highest peaks.
[392:21.84]Keep doing what you're doing, because you make my life and so many others full of joy and laughter from even the shortest of streams.
[392:29.78]That means a lot.
[392:30.28]Thank you.
[392:35.86]Uh... People that laugh together, last together.
[392:43.13]It means a lot.
[392:44.53]Thank you so much, guys.
[392:48.15]And HoneyChain at the very end, thanks for the one dollar.
[392:50.27]You're my heart.
[392:52.13]Thank you.
[392:57.96]Why am I getting booed?
[393:01.14]Why am I getting booed?
[393:02.02]Why are you booing me?
[393:10.79]Boo.
[393:12.09]Let's get the credits on here before we end, and I will see you guys tomorrow with the Nintendo Labo Vehicle Kit.
[393:19.02]What if I just fucking did that?
[393:21.16]There's a ton of people.
[393:22.80]More than half of the audience leaves during this portion.
[393:27.53]How fucking mad do you think everyone would be if I turned the stream on and it was the lab I was doing it tomorrow?
[393:38.14]Part of me kind of wants to do that.
[393:40.30]But, I don't know.
[393:42.09]I got, you know what?
[393:43.15]I kind of think I'm just gonna play L.A.
[393:44.49]Noire for like 30 minutes.
[393:46.87]And then I'm just gonna turn the webcam on and it's the Labo behind me.
[393:49.40]And we're just gonna pivot immediately to it for 8 hours.
[394:09.28]Don't tell anybody.
[394:11.33]Well, uh, what time is it?
[394:12.49]It's... I'm... Maybe I can run to, like, the store.
[394:17.89]Vegas never turns off, man.
[394:20.11]I can... I can go to the store at, like, midnight.
[394:23.35]And, like, go get anything I want.
[394:28.39]Oh, would that be... That would be such a... I think I'm gonna... I'm gonna do it.
[394:31.93]That sounds, like, just stupid enough for me to be happy with it.
[394:38.08]We'll see.
[394:38.42]We'll see if I can get it.
[394:39.12]I'm just gonna play L.A.
[394:42.85]in War for like 25 minutes, and then I'm just gonna pan back.
[394:46.41]And that's it.
[394:49.09]Build a level.
[394:53.17]Or I might- What if I got sucked into- Yeah, like, well, it'll just be ready behind me.
[394:58.29]Over the next couple of days.
[395:08.03]Alright, we'll try.
[395:09.99]But let's run the credits.
[395:12.45]All the new subs and old subs.
[395:13.77]Thank you, everybody.
[395:15.63]Here they come.
[395:18.52]Thank you, all of you, for supporting the stream, as always.
[395:23.14]Every single one of you are all fucking amazing.
[395:27.38]Just start making, just make Labo puns the whole time.
[395:31.33]Yeah.
[395:31.45]Yeah.
[395:32.73]You guys really gotta keep quiet on this, though, because I'm gonna just reference cardboard and shit for, like, the first 20 minutes.
[395:49.28]I'll, like, bump into somebody who crashed, and go, oh, that guy really crashed, like, crushed, like, a piece of cardboard.
[395:56.73]Oh, man, Nintendo really is, like, such an interesting company, making, like, all these new things that people, like, played on stream.
[396:08.35]This is cool.
[396:08.93]How did I do this?
[396:09.55]This is actually part of Streamlabs.
[396:12.13]It's not as detailed as I might like it to be.
[396:17.73]If I'm honest, because you can really only do one thing, and that's just scroll everybody.
[396:20.97]I wish it was possible to separate by length of time subscribed.
[396:28.81]Why don't I read the credits anymore?
[396:31.11]Well, there's two reasons.
[396:33.11]The first reason is, um, I think the shtick of screaming out names as fast as I can is kind of, uh, is kind of over.
[396:45.67]And the second thing is, there's so many of them now.
[396:50.43]So many people have subscribed to this channel now that it's, I can't even fucking believe it.
[397:02.34]It's truly, truly unbelievable.
[397:08.45]And it's not going away.
[397:10.95]It's just changing.
[397:12.77]Because over the next probably month or so, there's going to be something that happens at the end of the streams.
[397:18.84]In this spot right here, there's going to be some fairly fun little interesting things that are not... It's not going to be, oh, I'm going to...
[397:28.91]pick out some subs and they're like they're I'm gonna like shout them out no it'll be just something interesting so there will be something fun at the end of streams that includes all the people that subscribe during that stream
[397:56.31]You touched on this before, I remember.
[397:58.75]Yeah.
[398:01.76]It's tough because I want people to understand that, like, I really appreciate and care that they're giving me their hard-earned money every month.
[398:10.53]Some of you guys, like, I'm treated like a Netflix subscription, right?
[398:13.69]Like, it's just people have been subscribed for years.
[398:17.05]And I never want people to think that I just, oh, hey, thanks, bye.
[398:21.21]That's why, but something about just reading names doesn't do enough for me anymore.
[398:27.55]I'd like to try to do something fun.
[398:30.31]So, just give me some time.
[398:31.77]I'll figure it out.
[398:42.37]But, much love to y'all.
[398:49.81]When is Season 5 coming out?
[398:51.96]Season 5 of what?
[398:57.62]Give me an attaboy for my support.
[399:02.70]Yeah, and I think there's like two different ways to do like subscriptions and bits and everything.
[399:10.63]And I've always been of the opinion that I'd like to keep it as sort of like away from the stream as possible.
[399:17.49]Because my ADHD is impossible to keep up with.
[399:24.44]And I'd like to have them kind of just separated in a way.
[399:31.89]If that makes sense, I hope it does.
[399:35.68]Can't wait for the season of Fortnite.
[399:39.04]Are they in like season six or seven of Fortnite?
[399:46.72]I'm subbed to other people, and when they read messages as they're sent, it's really out of place.
[399:50.73]Well, I mean, it really depends, because, I mean, the only issue I ever had with it was, you know, when it's one person, when it's two people, okay, whatever, that's easy to do.
[400:03.03]When it turns into, like, 100, 200 people potentially on a stream, it's, you know, a sub message notification comes up potentially every, you know, 30 to 40 seconds, every minute, every two minutes.
[400:15.38]I've had streams where 400 people subscribed and it was like, holy shit.
[400:22.28]And it's hard to balance between... I want people to know that I care and that I thank them and that it means a fucking lot to me.
[400:29.88]But at the same time, there's a stream to do.
[400:34.20]You know what I mean?
[400:34.80]I would like to stream.
[400:38.01]It's something I think about a lot.
[400:43.01]The animation froze?
[400:43.93]What?
[400:44.29]Did it?
[400:50.27]So that's why over the years I've tried to come up with things to do, like the end of the stream here where we sit and we relax and talk about, you know, all the people that have donated money and I want to touch upon them and the subscription credits and... There'll always be something like that, I just have to figure out as if the channel continues to grow, more solutions and more things to do, to try.
[401:16.94]But, uh, that is for another day.
[401:19.61]I will see you guys tomorrow for the Nintendo Labo stream!
[401:24.86]I'm gonna piss a lot of people off.
[401:30.34]It has to happen, though.
[401:35.25]Thanks a lot, guys.
[401:36.25]See you tomorrow.
[401:37.71]Take care.
[401:38.25]Have a great rest of your night.
