[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.95]Welcome to the fucking real meat and potatoes of this one.
[00:05.63]This is Hivemind.
[00:07.79]So how this works, this was made by somebody in this community.
[00:15.58]Did they put their, uh... Did they put their... Oh, I gotta refresh the page.
[00:23.94]They were gonna put the social media down there.
[00:26.32]Did they?
[00:26.64]But anyways...
[00:30.77]Uh, it's so many, yeah, that's how many tabs I had open.
[00:33.46]Hivemind is family feud in a browser.
[00:35.98]This is genius.
[00:40.42]It's hivemind.fyi.
[00:42.34]I am going to host a game, and here's how this is going to work.
[00:46.63]I'm going to send you a link to the chat, and we're, we, this is a test.
[00:51.91]We're going to see if we can have an absolute shitload of people use this.
[00:55.62]The site might just explode.
[00:57.70]We don't know.
[00:58.80]But it's been scaled up.
[01:02.22]And I'm going to give you a link.
[01:03.74]You click the link.
[01:04.84]All you have to do is click the link.
[01:05.76]You don't have to do anything else.
[01:08.10]And you're going to get a series of questions.
[01:11.80]I'll give you an example.
[01:12.94]So you're going to get two questions a round.
[01:14.60]There's five rounds.
[01:16.84]It's going to say, hey, name something that you put on your head.
[01:21.65]And one word answers, guys, because it's going to take the top six answers that people said, or the top eight, and I'm going to have to guess what you guys did.
[01:33.92]Over the course of five rounds, there's a lightning round at the end.
[01:36.06]The second question is for the lightning round.
[01:39.74]By the way, because there's so many people doing this, don't worry.
[01:45.24]It's not like it's going to be like, oh, name something that flies.
[01:49.59]Dick, ass, penis, dick, dick.
[01:51.19]Like, you're not going to show up on stream.
[01:52.71]I just want to make that clear.
[01:53.99]It has to be like potentially thousands of you have to say the exact same thing.
[01:59.31]So, it doesn't matter.
[02:01.63]Leaking the lobby doesn't matter because you're just going to click on the link anyways.
[02:05.89]Let's see if this works.
[02:07.43]Let's try this out.
[02:09.67]Jerma, what?
[02:12.09]Jerma, why did you say that?
[02:13.07]Why did you say that shit?
[02:13.93]Why did you say that shit?
[02:14.85]What?
[02:15.17]That doesn't matter.
[02:15.89]Here we go.
[02:18.33]You ready?
[02:19.35]I'm going to give you a link.
[02:20.93]I'm going to host a game.
[02:22.97]Here, we'll read it.
[02:23.59]Hide Mine is a game where you try to guess how a group of people would answer a question.
[02:26.63]When a game starts, there will be a link that you can share with your friends.
[02:29.29]You'll then be shown a series of questions, and you will have to guess your friend's top answers to earn points.
[02:34.79]Pretty sick.
[02:36.22]So I don't know what you guys are writing, obviously.
[02:39.56]Let's see how this works.
[02:40.85]Hosting a game now.
[02:43.23]Join the game here.
[02:45.01]And if you'll take a look, you'll see it'll show how many people are actually here.
[02:48.99]Let's actually copy this so you guys can actually go here.
[02:53.19]Let's see what happens.
[02:56.91]Down here it says how many people are actually connected.
[02:58.69]Let's do this.
[03:02.65]I'm going to start the game in a minute.
[03:08.23]1,200 people.
[03:08.83]1,300.
[03:09.35]This is an insane experiment, by the way.
[03:12.19]I can't wait to see how this plays out.
[03:18.93]That link is this lobby.
[03:23.70]Let's see if it crashes.
[03:28.30]I am going to cap this.
[03:29.66]I'm just going to go eventually here.
[03:31.28]I'm just going to click the button.
[03:35.03]If you want to play, get in there.
[03:38.75]Close out of all the tabs.
[03:40.03]No, I like living dangerously.
[03:48.68]Okay.
[03:50.58]I'm going to do it.
[03:52.20]There's 4,100 people that want to play.
[03:55.88]I'm ready to start the game.
[03:59.32]Oh, hold on.
[03:59.73]All right, you get five seconds.
[04:05.81]Wait, why are people leaving?
[04:07.71]Hey, don't leave!
[04:08.31]Hey!
[04:09.57]Why are you leaving?
[04:10.35]Don't leave!
[04:13.65]Wait, everybody just clicked off.
[04:14.85]Everybody left.
[04:16.73]Okay, here we go.
[04:20.53]You're about to play five standard rounds.
[04:22.81]In each round, you have 30 seconds for the hive mind to be surveyed.
[04:25.45]Afterwards, you get a chance to guess the top eight answers.
[04:29.09]Game starts in five seconds.
[04:30.11]You get 30 seconds to answer.
[04:31.17]Make it simple.
[04:32.97]No sentences.
[04:33.87]One word.
[04:34.53]Lowercase.
[04:36.21]Name a bad job for someone who is accident prone.
[04:40.59]You have 25 seconds to answer.
[04:47.21]Sight broke.
[04:51.75]Kill it.
[04:55.33]Oh, no.
[04:58.57]Dead link.
[05:00.57]Wait, let's see.
[05:01.17]Hold on.
[05:11.77]Did it work?
[05:15.09]People in game refresh.
[05:17.93]Wait, I refresh?
[05:19.95]No, it's loading.
[05:20.61]It's loading.
[05:20.99]It's loading.
[05:23.16]Hold on.
[05:23.36]I'm not going to touch anything.
[05:25.52]Here we go.
[05:27.00]Name a bad job for someone who is accident-prone.
[05:50.26]It's trying.
[05:54.38]Lowercase only.
[05:55.50]Right.
[05:55.76]Wait, did I get it?
[06:00.15]Okay, wait.
[06:00.69]I'll go on.
[06:01.77]Name a bad job for someone who's accent-prone.
[06:04.21]A waiter.
[06:09.41]You killed it.
[06:10.41]You're getting an error message.
[06:11.52]Oh, wait.
[06:14.92]Let me look.
[06:15.22]Let me open up Discord and see if the dev is saying anything.
[06:20.08]Did I get it?
[06:20.44]No.
[06:25.46]This was the stress test, by the way.
[06:29.54]It was like, you know what?
[06:30.28]Let's just dump a shitload of people on here and see if this works.
[06:34.74]Alright, hold on.
[06:35.32]Where's my Discord?
[06:36.60]Where's my Discord?
[06:37.18]Where's my Discord?
[06:38.58]Where's my Discord?
[06:39.38]Hurry!
[06:42.32]Oh, hold on.
[06:51.47]Okay, uh, tell people to refresh if you're in here.
[06:56.89]Refresh if you're in here.
[06:58.41]Okay, let me try waiter again.
[07:02.67]I'm the dev, what's up?
[07:03.65]No, you're not.
[07:04.19]I'm talking to the dev over here.
[07:05.27]Maybe we should try again?
[07:09.61]Should I refresh the page?
[07:12.77]You couldn't even answer?
[07:13.59]Oh, okay, alright.
[07:15.57]Alright, let me start a new game.
[07:16.57]I'm gonna cap it at a thousand people, by the way.
[07:19.84]Wait, it's loading.
[07:25.94]To the bar?
[07:32.30]Oh, shit.
[07:33.16]That doesn't look good.
[07:33.98]Application error.
[07:35.04]Check your logs.
[07:46.37]Communicating with hive mind.
[07:47.99]Applica- Okay.
[07:50.24]I think we broke it.
[07:50.92]Hey, what about that Glungus test?
[07:56.52]Go back, it worked?
[07:57.70]Did I, wait, did I do it?
[08:03.20]Too many people went on.
[08:04.74]Too many people.
[08:05.42]Alright, hold on.
[08:06.28]Let me do some communication in here.
[08:10.24]Alright, I'm gonna... I have an idea.
[08:15.95]Here's my idea.
[08:16.49]You ready for my idea?
[08:21.95]I got 83 points?
[08:22.81]No, I didn't.
[08:23.19]This is a new link.
[08:24.75]I'm gonna do a new link.
[08:27.25]It's working?
[08:27.77]I don't think it is.
[08:29.95]I'm stuck here.
[08:31.13]What the fuck?
[08:32.31]Stay on.
[08:34.07]I'm kind of stuck here.
[08:37.47]I got 83 points?
[08:41.15]Uh-oh.
[08:42.77]I think we might have to pivot to Chubby Bunny.
[08:52.87]New game.
[08:53.25]Let's try it again.
[09:01.12]You know what?
[09:01.64]Let's not even link this shit.
[09:03.78]Like, this probably, like, I think 11,000 people that are here.
[09:07.56]Probably 8,000 of you.
[09:08.98]This is, that's too much work.
[09:10.42]You'd be like, ugh.
[09:12.71]No, never mind.
[09:13.87]I don't want it.
[09:14.61]I don't care.
[09:16.19]So, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna cap it to 1,000.
[09:18.11]Let's see if it works.
[09:24.57]I'm capping it at 1,000.
[09:25.14]Let's see, let's try that.
[09:27.78]Okay, cap it now.
[09:31.14]Here we go!
[09:37.32]You have 30 seconds.
[09:38.34]Let's see if it works.
[09:38.96]Try it again.
[09:46.26]Name something you do in front of a mirror.
[09:50.20]And this, by the way, the second question that you're answering is for the lightning round at the end.
[09:54.06]I can't see it.
[09:58.66]Oh, it crashed.
[10:01.30]More data.
[10:02.30]Give us more data on how much people can connect.
[10:09.15]I think it's working.
[10:10.33]I think it's just slow.
[10:14.23]Okay, let's see what happens.
[10:16.23]Does it load?
[10:19.19]Let's see.
[10:19.53]It worked?
[10:27.48]Name something you can do in front of a mirror.
[10:35.09]I saw what somebody wrote and I can't even fucking say what it was.
[10:39.71]Why would you do that?
[10:41.83]Why would you do that in front of a mirror?
[10:43.67]You guys are disgusting.
[10:46.57]Ah, shit!
[10:50.25]Alright.
[10:51.55]Alright, we'll try it one more time.
[10:52.59]We'll try it one more time.
[10:53.53]We're going to try it one more time.
[10:56.12]This time I'm going to cap it at 500 people.
[10:59.22]We'll try it again.
[10:59.84]Here we go.
[11:00.16]Ready?
[11:03.94]Refresh.
[11:05.75]Refresh.
[11:08.29]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[11:10.75]I'm pushing some changes.
[11:13.19]It's probably going to be working in five minutes.
[11:15.15]Hold on.
[11:17.12]It doesn't cap, by the way.
[11:18.74]Oh, okay.
[11:20.60]Dev's pushing changes right now.
[11:23.36]Refresh it now.
[11:24.00]Refresh, refresh, refresh.
[11:24.84]All right, all right, I'm going.
[11:33.13]Okay, name something you do in front of a mirror.
[11:37.14]Uh, flex.
[11:43.28]Flex in front of a mirror.
[11:48.68]It's thinking.
[11:50.48]It's thinking.
[11:55.47]Hold on, did I get it?
[11:56.41]Maybe I should play Chubby Bunny in between rounds.
[12:04.71]Oh, nope, hold on.
[12:13.70]Just don't exit.
[12:17.76]I'm not going anywhere.
[12:21.26]Bingo!
[12:21.66]It works!
[12:23.58]175 people said flex.
[12:25.78]I got it.
[12:27.54]Alright.
[12:28.56]Name something you do in front of a mirror.
[12:32.58]I don't want to write Zerk off, okay?
[12:34.44]You know the real one.
[12:35.89]Name something you do in front of a mirror.
[12:38.65]Ugh.
[12:41.22]sing?
[12:43.14]People like sing into the mirror, don't they?
[12:51.14]Maybe?
[12:54.37]Do you sing in front of a mirror?
[12:55.69]Do you cry in the mirror?
[12:59.39]Does that go through?
[12:59.95]Okay, here we go.
[13:02.69]Now, there we go.
[13:03.49]The loading bar.
[13:04.11]I already guessed that.
[13:08.36]Oh no, that was strike.
[13:09.18]I got it wrong.
[13:10.78]Okay.
[13:12.34]Uh, something to do in front of the mirror.
[13:13.88]Top eight answers.
[13:14.64]Some of these are going to be so fucking specific.
[13:17.02]Something you do in front of a mirror.
[13:19.71]Oh, we gotta get the music back on.
[13:31.23]Alright, let's go.
[13:31.69]Alright, what do you do in front of a mirror?
[13:33.21]Brush.
[13:34.89]Uh, brush teeth.
[13:40.34]Make sure your answers are simple as fuck, by the way.
[13:43.68]Don't write like, Will, I get up in the morning and I make a coffee and I... No, just one or two words.
[13:48.42]Lowercase.
[13:54.95]You said one word.
[13:55.97]Yeah, well, that's what I mean.
[13:57.17]Like, make it simple.
[14:00.39]Like, if it's brush your teeth, it's brush teeth, not brush your teeth.
[14:08.21]I'm winning.
[14:10.68]What's underneath flex?
[14:11.74]Okay, name something you do in front of a mirror.
[14:13.50]Flex.
[14:14.98]Brush teeth.
[14:19.80]I don't want to write it, but I feel like you all said it.
[14:29.38]Flex.
[14:29.98]Brush teeth.
[14:31.36]Pop zits?
[14:35.31]Pop zits.
[14:38.05]People like lean in and they... Yes, they do.
[14:46.46]What do you mean what's wrong with you?
[14:48.18]You do that.
[14:48.78]I know you do.
[14:50.78]You did that an hour ago.
[14:51.98]You still have the mark there.
[14:55.65]Nope.
[14:57.61]Strike two.
[14:59.95]You guys don't like... Yes, you fucking do.
[15:02.73]Hair.
[15:04.85]Comb.
[15:05.31]Comb hair.
[15:16.40]It works!
[15:16.98]It actually, I mean, it's a little, it chugs along a little, but it works.
[15:20.54]Okay.
[15:22.45]I got it wrong.
[15:23.75]Okay, top answers were flex, pose, cry, brush teeth, masturbate, smile, shave, and dance.
[15:34.46]Who zerks off into the mirror?
[15:52.59]Just answer the fucking question already and let's meme-ify this.
[15:57.09]How many times have I leaned over and did that voice?
[15:59.05]How many times have I leaned forward and said something?
[16:00.88]Alright, what is it?
[16:03.88]Name something you do multiple times a day.
[16:10.40]I know, okay.

[26:13.10]But I'm not going to say, hey, yo, you want to go to McDonald's for a date?
[26:16.55]I would take you to McDonald's.
[26:17.71]I would go to McDonald's.
[26:18.55]I'd have you pick me up and we can go to McDonald's, but I'm not going to make that my idea.

[29:16.10]And then you laugh at a joke I make, and what if they don't think it's funny?

[40:37.55]I'm not saying it.
[40:39.15]I'm not saying it.

[49:23.07]It streams over in like 30 minutes.
[49:24.23]Just want to make that really clear.
[49:26.31]We're going to do this again.
[49:28.45]Don't worry.
[49:29.45]Alright, let's open it up.
[49:30.51]Hive Mind.
[49:32.33]Start a game.
[49:34.13]And click.
[49:43.78]Why can I never get it right?
[49:49.04]It looks like I was just running really fast in like a cartoon or something, and I stopped really abruptly.
[49:53.17]Alright, are we ready?
[50:02.23]Only a thousand people, there's like 11k people here!
[50:04.77]Click on it if you- no actually don't, because then the servers will be fine.
[50:07.37]Alright, I'm starting in 3... 2...
[50:14.55]One.
[50:15.55]Action!
[50:18.18]You're about to play five rounds!
[50:20.38]Go for it.
[50:20.98]Game starts in 11 seconds.
[50:34.17]Name something you should never eat late at night.
[50:56.12]And you have a bonus question to ask that don't tell me what that one is, because that's a lightning round question.
[51:08.07]It was Overwatch, okay.
[51:09.39]Alright, something you should never eat late at night.
[51:10.85]Let's see if it works.
[51:12.47]It's pretty smooth.
[51:14.31]Okay, something you shouldn't eat late at night.
[51:15.77]I don't think you should eat, um... I don't think you should eat ice cream at night.
[51:22.06]Because it's just a lot of dairy and a lot of sugar and it really gets in there.
[51:25.64]Actually, we need the loading bar to make sure this is working.
[51:28.02]It is.
[51:28.24]Okay, good.
[51:31.46]It's a lot of sugar and a lot of dairy and it just sits in you.
[51:34.30]And when you lie down, it just... I don't know.
[51:36.26]I don't think so.
[51:36.92]Good.
[51:37.26]Told you.
[51:37.68]There's at least 72 people in there.

[51:48.10]Alright, something you should never eat late at night.
[51:50.54]Coffee.
[51:51.12]Coffee.
[51:53.58]What, do you want to be up all night?

[53:07.92]I looked over at the marshmallow, like, just gross marshmallow puke shit over here.
[53:10.78]Like, it was in my mouth, and now it's making me sick looking at it.
[53:14.58]Ah, something you shouldn't eat at night.
[53:16.30]How about a... I feel like some people might have just written food.
[53:26.35]Don't you feel like that?
[53:27.05]People just got lazy and they're like, I guess food.
[53:29.69]Wrong.
[53:39.67]What should you not eat late at night?
[53:43.93]Asp, ice cream, coffee.

[54:16.01]What are you talking about?

[54:24.06]What do you mean no?
[54:25.16]Something you shouldn't eat at night.

[54:33.58]Uh, cheese, pizza, marshmallows, um... Name the worst place to fall asleep.
[54:45.04]Please.
[54:46.06]If you could.
[54:50.62]Hivemind.
[54:51.18]That's the name of the game.
[54:52.03]That's right.
[54:54.89]Worst place to fall asleep.
[54:56.51]Uh... During an earthquake?
[55:03.21]Well, that's the worst place.
[55:04.03]Not the worst thing.
[55:05.53]Worst place to fall asleep.
[55:09.63]Uh...
[55:18.54]Okay, this is actually pretty smooth right now.
[55:21.34]Name the worst place to fall asleep.
[55:24.26]Uh, I'm just going to write this because I know that you all are really, really, really funny jokers.
[55:35.97]I guarantee you it's up there.

[63:18.57]It could be.
[63:19.01]I think it is.
[63:23.85]I'm imagining the dentist telling a joke and being like, and the guy like, this is a bad idea, but if you can save 15%, that's a dumb Geico ad.

[77:42.69]Just type it into Google, YouTube, doesn't matter.
[77:44.28]Just watch that video, you'll understand.
[77:47.12]That's too bad.

[77:55.78]You'll get it.
[77:56.31]It's my face.

[79:01.95]He's even got a versus mode that he's working on, too.
[79:05.59]And remember, keep in mind, this is really important to know, all of you here.
[79:09.44]This is just a project that somebody in the community made.
[79:14.89]They were like, hey, you talked about a family feud thing with the community?
[79:17.87]I'm just going to make that.
[79:21.12]This is not... This is not some website that I, like, just... Oh, I just found it.

[80:21.93]Apparently, there are over 100 questions.
[80:25.45]And he can just put in new ones as he sees fit.
[80:29.25]He said there's like 400 questions that are not really implemented yet.
[80:33.87]But he can.
[80:34.27]Yeah, it's crazy.
[80:40.20]It's pretty crazy.
[80:44.72]Also, keep in mind, this is the uptime on this website with 10,000 people all opening at the same time.
[80:51.29]That's ridiculous.
[80:53.46]I thought we were just never going to be able to play it.
[80:55.34]All right, here we go.
[80:56.86]Name a reason you might not get hired after a job.
[80:58.84]Okay.
[81:02.00]Let's just do the same ones I did before.
[81:03.62]Close the stream.
[81:06.58]I need to go home.
[81:08.12]I'm done in like probably 10 minutes.
[81:10.77]We get to the end of this?
[81:17.64]End of the stream, voice?
[81:18.38]Yeah.
[81:19.52]Yeah, we'll call it after this.
[81:21.39]It's been a fun night.
[81:22.71]Uh, yeah, there it is.
[81:23.31]Okay.
[81:24.17]I hate writing this word.
[81:25.33]I find it to be, like, just disgusting.
[81:27.31]I hate writing that.
[81:28.15]I hate even saying it or thinking it.
[81:30.66]It disgusts me.
[81:36.70]Holy shit.
[81:37.33]Okay.
[81:46.31]Do chubby bunny before you close.

[82:00.38]You fight.
[82:04.83]Farting.
[82:10.85]Oh.
[82:11.83]Okay, fart.
[82:12.33]Fart.
[82:15.03]If you fart during an interview, I'm trying to think if I was the person interviewing.
[82:20.13]I would just pretend it didn't happen.
[82:21.25]I don't think it would affect the actual job outcome.
[82:23.24]I think I would just be like, fuck, that was probably really awkward for them.
[82:28.42]I'm not going to even say anything.
[82:29.64]It actually might actually help how I feel about you.
[82:33.22]You know?
[82:34.06]Oh, fuck.
[82:35.16]He farted in here and he was wicked embarrassed.
[82:39.02]Oh, maybe I should give him this job.
[82:40.48]Hmm.

[82:44.86]Nobody farted in here besides them.
[82:49.68]Alright, they're hired.
[82:50.32]I'm going to hire them.
[82:53.88]Okay, what was the other one?
[82:55.80]You were naked.
[83:00.07]Interviewers don't look at you as humans.
[83:05.21]If you're naked, okay.

[94:16.11]Let me see if there were any major big ones.
[94:17.91]I think there were a few.
[94:20.85]I hate missing shit like this.
[94:23.60]Actually, I'll go through them right now because there were a lot.
[94:26.46]SpliceableSpleen, thanks for five community subs.
[94:29.26]YesIsOnline, five.
[94:30.64]FBIOfficial, five.

[94:37.58]Freddy Dread, 50 earlier.
[94:39.21]Remember that one?
[94:39.75]That was fucking crazy.

[94:43.43]Dropshock, 5.
[94:45.75]I think I caught the other ones.
[94:47.37]We also had two very major donations come in.
[94:52.55]We had two $50 donations come in back-to-back.
[94:55.83]Well, they were like three hours apart, but you know.
[94:59.19]5,000 bits from Corican.
[95:01.34]Thank you, Corican, for the ridiculous amount of money.
[95:03.18]It's a huge amount of money.
[95:03.88]No one's ever expected to give me that kind of money.
[95:06.58]I'll take it.
[95:09.06]It's my birthday today.
[95:09.86]I'm 32.
[95:10.72]Catching up to you.
[95:12.74]Yeah, it feels kind of weird when you get to be over 30.
[95:16.39]Especially over 35.
[95:19.35]I'm definitely getting older.
[95:21.53]I can feel myself getting a little older.
[95:23.85]I'm getting a little bit of crow's feet.
[95:25.31]I'm getting the hairs thinning a little.
[95:28.18]So I'm 35 now.
[95:29.38]When I'm 40, 45, that's only five years away.
[95:32.52]I'm five years away from 40.
[95:35.42]That seems so odd to say out loud.
[95:37.78]40 years old in five years.
[95:41.94]I feel like I'm not ready to be 40.
[95:46.74]I'm not ready for that.
[95:49.37]But happy birthday.
[95:50.55]Thanks for the $50.
[95:51.17]You don't have to give me $50 on your birthday.
[95:56.03]Oh shit, I want to do this too.
[95:57.11]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[96:01.83]One sec, one sec, one sec.
[96:06.47]Here is, if you want to support Hivemind and its development.
[96:14.02]He actually has one of these links.
[96:14.92]He has a Ko-Fi link.
[96:19.58]If you care enough.
[96:23.12]He put this together just... He was just like, hey, I made that thing that you talked about.
[96:28.62]So, that's awesome.
[96:34.59]Very, very cool.
[96:36.06]I look forward to the development of this continuing.
[96:38.16]There's going to be a versus mode.
[96:46.70]The servers will be... And the servers actually stabilize pretty well.
[96:49.54]We had a few crashes.
[96:51.28]But that's okay.
[96:52.16]That's to be understood.
[96:56.27]Got a lot of good potential.
[96:57.31]It sure does.
[96:59.63]But thanks for making it.
[97:06.66]And, uh, let's see.
[97:07.84]I'm going to go out here.
[97:10.94]Why did I feel like I was just going to turn the stream on at 144p?
[97:16.62]I don't know why.
[97:19.12]Oh, and I got to turn the stream on at 144p because I said I was going to do that.
[97:31.80]And let's, uh... Hey, let's go to Ludwig.
[97:37.50]Been a while since we raided Ludwig.
[97:40.16]Talked about him on stream today, so let's go.
[97:44.55]Go say hi to Ludwig.
[97:45.95]Tell him that I sent you.
[97:47.47]Of course he's gonna know.
[97:51.77]What is he doing?
[97:52.97]Ludwig, what are you doing?
[97:54.73]What are you up to?
[97:58.17]Ludwig is AOC VOD review.
[97:59.21]He's reviewing VOD.
[98:07.45]Alright, we'll see what he has to say.
[98:09.23]Take care, guys.
[98:11.35]We'll see you in a few days.
[98:14.47]Thanks a lot, everybody.
[98:16.59]Hello, I'm Jerma985, Senya.
[98:19.31]Ludwig is a good dude.
[98:21.01]Go show some love.
[98:23.63]And goodbye.
[98:27.71]I don't think I did it right.
[98:29.91]How come he's not showing up?
[98:32.37]Why did that not work?
[98:36.28]There we are.
[98:36.92]Here we go.
[98:41.43]See you in a few days.
