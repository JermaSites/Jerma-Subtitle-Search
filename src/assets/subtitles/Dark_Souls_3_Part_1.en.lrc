[01:44.86]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[01:50.59]Alright, let's get these out of the way.

[02:08.22]What did I miss?
[02:08.88]I missed somebody.
[02:12.44]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[02:16.44]So many people are resubscribing.
[02:18.30]We're going to have to sit here for a few minutes while I figure this out.
[02:24.91]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[02:27.87]Ajajaja 5.
[02:30.23]Antejo P. Megacarp.

[02:45.68]What a shitload of you.
[02:50.91]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[02:53.92]This is gonna happen for a while.
[02:58.72]Whop Ronnie frozen crazy tuna.
[03:02.52]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[03:08.45]I gotta beat the character creator star on the character creation.
[03:12.42]Yeah, so do I have the patch?
[03:13.52]Do I actually have the patch?
[03:19.91]I wonder.
[03:21.07]I'm going to assume I do.
[03:21.86]Because wasn't there like a big day one patch?
[03:26.46]Mr. Kuklaid.
[03:28.36]Kosei.
[03:29.84]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[03:32.46]You guys are going to hear Orson Welles for a good five minutes.
[03:35.94]Narflock, resubscribe as well.
[03:37.82]Welcome back, all you guys.
[03:39.04]Come on, controller.
[03:39.66]Why is my controller not working?
[03:42.94]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[03:47.47]Why is my controller not working?
[03:49.05]Sister.
[03:51.90]The Savvy Sultan.
[03:55.50]I'm reading everyone's name as they come in.
[03:57.14]Yeah, they should be able to... Hold on, let me go back to this.
[04:06.31]I think a nightbot might be broken.
[04:07.29]Okay.
[04:07.39]Yeah.
[04:22.83]It works right here, but I can't get it to work anywhere else.
[04:27.91]Okay, there we go.
[04:28.41]That was weird.
[04:29.25]That's really odd.
[04:31.93]Alright, so I'm going to describe something very quickly.
[04:36.25]Well, we have a second.
[04:37.45]I'm going to turn this down just for a second so you can hear me.
[04:42.80]So, the chat currently is in sub-only mode.
[04:45.83]Actually, fuck, I forgot to tweet it out.
[04:48.45]Ah, wow, what an idiot.
[04:51.95]There we go.
[04:53.74]The chat is in sub only.
[04:55.48]That is because I want to avoid spoilers and, you know, backseating.
[04:59.74]Because this game has been out.
[05:01.12]People have been streaming this game for like three weeks.
[05:05.09]So, I don't want to have to look in the chat and have people be like, How do you not know how to go there?
[05:10.95]Did you not see when this guy streamed it like three weeks ago?
[05:13.09]No, I have been completely avoiding most spoilers of this game.
[05:17.88]And avoiding watching it.
[05:20.29]which I'm sure a lot of people in the chat or in watching right now probably can agree with too, although you're here watching right now, aren't you?
[05:29.29]So there is currently this chat, my chat, or you can go over to Kim's chat.
[05:35.79]and that is an open chat right now as long as you know you're not an asshole but if you're not non-sub you can chat there I just want to make sure that when I look over a chat I don't see hey here's like how you beat the first boss in five seconds and I'll be like guy already saw it I can't do anything about it this ain't gonna happen very often so just I guess we'll keep that in mind okay so I'm gonna play
[06:06.73]We're going to be needing a lot of that.
[06:09.23]Stilvan.
[06:10.55]By the way, thank you all the resubs.
[06:12.35]There was like 10 of those in a row.
[06:14.59]Thank you everybody for resubscribing.
[06:15.97]And thanks to Stilvan for coming in.
[06:19.42]So, here we go.
[06:21.52]Here we go, guys.
[06:22.36]I have no idea what I'm doing.
[06:23.60]I just beat Dark Souls 2 this past week to get myself prepared for the game.
[06:29.32]So, I am so excited.
[06:35.05]Thanks, Leon.
[06:36.83]Welcome back.
[06:38.07]Six months?
[06:39.01]Gosh darn.
[06:40.79]I don't want, I hate, you know, it tells you to go dark, but I don't want to go that dark.
[06:44.27]Destroy him!
[06:50.66]Arcaneer welcome dude.
[06:51.94]Thanks for seven.
[06:53.06]We're gonna go with six I'm gonna keep these all on default because I don't really know very much what they do So we're gonna go Adidas footwear Okay, I got a feeling that Paul Bearer is gonna really fuck up this cinematic Alright where the transitory lands of the lords of cinder converge
[07:24.68]In venturing north, the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words.
[07:35.61]Destroy him!
[07:38.36]The fire fades, and the lords go without thrones.
[07:55.45]It was just barely in the background.
[08:00.43]Oh, god damn it.
[08:02.43]This is so loud.
[08:04.32]This is so loud.
[08:05.38]I turned down the audio.
[08:06.96]What the...
[08:22.82]Aldrich, Saint of the Deep.
[08:35.86]Hey, Rad, but thanks for something.
[08:38.52]Farron's undead legion, the Abyss Watchers.
[08:45.10]It's just very...
[08:55.67]and the reclusive lord of the ancient capital.
[09:05.72]You're the giant.
[09:11.95]I turned it down and it's still this loud.
[09:26.23]Only in truth, lords will abandon their homes.
[09:37.08]I've missed this whole cinematic.
[09:39.88]I don't even know what happened.
[09:41.08]And the unkindled will rise.
[09:51.45]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[09:55.48]Nameless, accursed, undead, unfit even to be cinder.
[10:01.02]They're like trying so desperately to talk over the cinematic.
[10:06.18]Thanks for the research.
[10:13.56]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[10:17.35]Oh, good to know.
[10:17.95]Thanks, Orson.
[10:19.05]Thanks for telling me that.
[10:20.05]Thanks for finishing up the cinematic with telling me that.
[10:23.39]Fortress final cue, thanks.
[10:24.83]Thanks to the people that subbed.
[10:25.83]That was actually pretty funny.
[10:29.20]I'm your dad.
[10:31.62]Destroy him!
[10:35.06]Whoa!
[10:36.74]Best chin NA.
[10:38.32]Best chin in North America.
[10:39.62]Really.
[10:41.50]I got a couple of chins that might be better.
[10:44.66]Jay Leno.
[10:45.92]Glue Man.
[10:48.42]Okay, age.
[10:48.98]We're going to make him old.
[10:49.94]Alright.
[10:52.26]I don't have any idea what I want to do in this game.
[10:56.32]No idea.
[11:00.22]Level 2 humanoid.
[11:03.73]I think I'm just going to play it safe and just do like a dex build or a strength build or something.
[11:07.55]Because this is the first time playing.
[11:09.83]I'm not going to mess around with pyromancy or be a cleric.
[11:13.23]I'm not doing deprived either.
[11:14.41]Uh...
[11:20.27]Did they get rid of adaptability?
[11:23.55]I don't see adaptability here.
[11:27.95]Huh.
[11:30.72]I think mercenary probably is just the best kind of straightaway balanced with some dexterity.
[11:36.50]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[11:40.90]Hey, leather jacket, what's up?
[11:46.40]Welcome back.
[11:47.12]Welcome back, both of you subscribers.
[11:51.00]Yeah, no more adaptability.
[11:52.26]Really?
[11:53.00]Huh.
[11:53.74]Okay.
[11:54.90]Well, I think I'm going to go Mercenary.
[11:56.02]I'm going to do a Dex build.
[11:58.06]Maybe a little bit of Strength.
[11:59.86]I feel like this is probably... Because I don't want to have no HP.
[12:04.16]Vigor is important early.
[12:08.63]Thief.
[12:10.09]What does he start with?
[12:13.51]Looks like he starts with a Soapstone.
[12:17.79]And the Fireband.
[12:18.71]I don't know.
[12:21.89]I'm your dad.
[12:22.59]I'm gonna go mercenary.
[12:28.17]Hey.
[12:29.59]Welcome, Abbott.
[12:30.57]Thanks for the sub.
[12:33.41]Ooh, life ring.
[12:34.49]Maybe we'll just do that.
[12:36.50]Maximum HP.
[12:38.94]Blessing, hidden blessing.
[12:41.52]Fire gem.
[12:43.98]Rusted gold coin.
[12:46.18]We're gonna go life ring.
[12:47.26]I want to just stay safe.
[12:49.68]Max HP, we're gonna do that.
[12:52.18]And now we've got to make our character the ugliest fucking person ever.
[13:02.61]Vernaculous.
[13:03.27]Thanks for the sub.
[13:05.71]Oh, he's going to be... We've got to have a big fat guy.
[13:07.87]Because, I mean, I always make the big fat guys.
[13:10.53]Yeah, very burly.
[13:18.69]Uh, gender, age, voice homework.
[13:23.79]A lot of subs, you guys.
[13:27.96]You guys really want to talk, huh?
[13:30.52]Fire Ant TV, and somebody else too.
[13:32.36]Who else was it?
[13:34.12]Rehab Vernaculous, I got him.
[13:35.78]And another reset.
[13:38.14]You guys really want to speak in this chat, huh?
[13:39.52]Uh, I want to go back.
[13:40.10]Appearance...
[13:50.83]Is he... Build detail.
[13:51.97]There we go.
[13:53.23]He's gonna have a huge head.
[13:54.19]Should he have a tiny head?
[14:01.32]Hey, how come when I make his head smaller, his body gets smaller?
[14:06.22]He looks like a fucking weirdo.
[14:07.50]Alright, we're gonna have a big chest, big head.
[14:10.40]Listen to me, son!
[14:11.99]I'm your dad!
[14:14.43]DESTROY HIM!
[14:18.76]What's going on, Croacher?
[14:19.52]No, we're going to have him be really top-heavy.
[14:27.09]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[14:29.97]A little waste.
[14:33.12]Why can't I do... That's stupid.
[14:34.94]El Pepperoni, thanks for coming back.
[14:36.24]Thanks for the six months.
[14:40.78]This guy's like a loaf of bread right now.
[14:42.44]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its sexiness.
[14:46.36]He looks like a lollipop.
[14:47.34]He looks like a loaf of bread.
[14:48.53]He looks like a sack of shit.
[14:51.77]Peel, peel, peeling.
[14:52.57]Welcome back.
[14:54.83]I want his arms to be small.
[14:57.51]There we go.
[15:03.16]Alright, I'm okay with this.
[15:07.63]Okay, we have a piece of bread person.
[15:11.55]Let's just make him... Should we make him green or something?
[15:14.99]We're going to have to make him green.
[15:19.29]I mean, you kind of have to, right?
[15:24.38]Actually, he kind of does.
[15:25.30]He does look like a potato sack.
[15:34.36]That's so stupid looking.
[15:36.49]Hold on.
[15:47.13]Pico Pico.
[15:48.78]Welcome.
[15:50.60]Here we go.
[15:51.02]He's just going to be like a frog because every character I have to have is a frog, right?
[16:00.68]Masculine face.
[16:06.45]Alright, this guy looks like he's missing all of his teeth.
[16:08.90]No, you know what it looks like?
[16:11.46]It looks like somebody took this guy's face and pinched his face together in clay.
[16:15.60]Like, I took my index finger and thumb and squished this guy's face.
[16:22.93]Oh, facial balance.
[16:26.99]Oh, this guy looks like absolute crap.
[16:28.99]I'm like throwing the- I gotta go back.
[16:32.59]Go back.
[16:32.99]Go back to features.
[16:34.93]Let's not make him such a psychopath.
[16:36.69]Because I need his eyes to be separated.
[16:40.27]He does look like the Grinch.
[16:45.91]First we're getting... Most importantly, we have to get big eyes.
[16:50.59]And they gotta be really... There we go.
[16:55.60]Like that.
[16:59.22]They gotta be way far up.
[17:02.05]I mean, if we are going to make the frog, then he better be a frog.
[17:10.61]Uh, nose ridge length.
[17:11.69]I'm going to go short.
[17:25.24]This kind of like hurts my eyes looking at this guy.
[17:28.70]He almost looks like he's blurred.
[17:37.50]Okay, here we go.
[17:43.23]Now I can start to build, because I see his face the way that it's supposed to be seen.
[17:52.44]His eyes have to be more open.
[17:55.46]Right now it's not.
[17:56.54]There we go.
[17:57.00]Okay, now he's just a sad frog.
[18:01.08]That's better.
[18:04.95]Eye size... I don't know what it would be.
[18:08.47]Forehead, here we go.
[18:12.59]The eyes have to be really bulging out if he's gonna be a frog.
[18:22.98]Let's go like this.
[18:29.06]It's so funny, like, none of this really matters, because throughout the whole... Ah, look at him!
[18:32.26]Watch when he blinks.
[18:32.92]That's... Okay, that's awful.
[18:35.97]Looks like he's blinking two sets of eyes.
[18:43.57]Nostrils.
[18:51.98]Jesus.
[18:56.84]Oh, it's gonna be like this.
[18:57.96]Alright, this is just Frog Voldemort.
[19:08.14]This is where we can make his face nice and fat like a frog.
[19:15.02]It's like you've punched an alien in the face.
[19:17.65]And broke his nose into his skull.
[19:23.07]I don't even know what this is anymore.
[19:27.09]Alright, frogs have like big mouths.
[19:37.02]It's probably going to have to be happy.
[19:38.40]That means bigger face.
[19:46.73]Conkex or concave?
[19:48.93]Conkex.
[19:49.75]Convex or concave?
[19:51.35]It's starting to look like my grandmother.
[19:54.25]There we go.
[20:13.19]God, this looks like somebody.
[20:14.73]Who does this look like?
[20:15.45]What is this?
[20:17.93]I swear to God, this is an actual person.
[20:32.40]I don't know who I made.
[20:42.17]Old lady in Yoda.
[20:44.53]Yeah, that's the kind it is.
[20:49.70]It's a green goblin, my grandmother.
[20:52.74]Yoda.
[20:53.14]I'm gonna have a nice big chin.
[21:00.78]There we go.
[21:01.34]He kinda looks like me.
[21:12.52]I feel like if I made that face into the camera, that would be me.
[21:17.37]Hold on a second, this is important.
[21:36.98]He's got this big hamburger face.
[21:47.24]Alright, we gotta mess- we gotta take this hair and he's just gotta go.
[21:58.91]Dether Dan, welcome.
[22:06.04]We gotta find the perfect hair.
[22:07.36]This is Johnny Tambourine.
[22:12.74]From Saul of the Mole Men.
[22:18.78]Uh, no long hair.
[22:19.94]Alright, perfect.
[22:23.32]Absolutely perfect.
[22:25.28]You can't get better than that.
[22:29.46]No eyebrows.
[22:30.48]Fuck eyebrows.
[22:37.04]Um... This is the guy from Trailer Park Boys.
[22:43.18]What's the guy's name?
[22:44.86]Lahey?
[22:45.88]From Trailer Park Boys?
[22:48.36]The guy that, like, the guy that, like, is, like, the security guy?
[22:52.34]Runs the place?
[22:54.19]I think that's his name.
[23:03.53]Jim Leahy.
[23:04.47]Yeah, I successfully made Jim.
[23:06.37]Green Jim Leahy.
[23:11.34]Grump Klump, thanks for five months.
[23:13.06]I think I actually kind of like Green Jim Leahy.
[23:18.48]Now let me tell you something, Ricky.
[23:20.64]You're not going to be doing any more fucked up shit in this park, Ricky.
[23:29.88]I'll take it right to the cops.
[23:31.13]I'll take it right to the cops, Ricky.
[23:40.29]I think he's good like that.
[23:42.39]Pupils.
[23:43.61]Color over color over color.
[23:49.10]I don't like messing with the eyes.
[23:54.85]Give me the correct, not, I don't have any eyes, eyes.
[23:59.07]We call her Jim Lee's?
[24:06.28]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[24:11.92]Joy, thanks for the two months, man.
[24:15.40]Green eyes, it's got to be green.
[24:19.46]Cosmetics.
[24:21.36]No, we're not done here.
[24:23.78]Wait, hold on a second.
[24:33.09]Alright.
[24:37.16]His head is so big.
[24:44.46]None of this, don't you guys know?
[24:46.72]Okay, get your fun from making a Dark Souls or a Bloodborne character.
[24:50.83]Don't worry, you'll never see this person's face.
[24:54.49]After like 25 minutes, you'll never see this face again.
[24:57.83]You won't even know that he has green skin.
[24:59.26]Alright, I think that's good to go.
[25:05.72]Where's, uh...
[25:16.13]It's like a Star Wars character.
[25:20.21]This just looks like a terrible Star Wars character that George Lucas just puked up in a nightmare.
[25:28.74]The thing on his back and the helmet just makes him look like he's going to go tattooing.
[25:38.66]Alright, let's go.
[25:40.66]Let's do it.
[25:41.94]Let's do it, Mighty Base.
[25:48.66]Mighty bass play.
[25:49.38]Thanks for something.
[25:52.54]Let's go.
[25:53.28]Wicked loud cinematic.
[25:54.14]Here it comes.
[25:54.60]Sorry.
[25:55.04]Sorry.
[25:56.68]Sorry.
[25:59.02]Loud cinematic.
[25:59.70]Sorry.
[26:12.15]I'm so excited.
[26:14.13]I'm so excited to die over and over again and be really upset and get extremely mad at this game and like rage quit the stream in two or three hours.
[26:21.19]It's gonna be great.
[26:38.22]Oh, look at, look at him like moving around.
[26:49.36]I have two swords.
[26:50.90]Two swords!
[26:52.21]Two!
[26:54.49]Okay, so, to reiterate, before we get started, I need to make this very clear.
[27:00.79]The chat is currently in sub-only mode.
[27:04.77]To avoid spoilers and avoid potential, like, hardcore backseating.
[27:09.54]Because I know the game's been out for a long time.
[27:11.20]People have been playing it, like, the Japanese version or the English version, you know, whatever.
[27:14.24]I didn't do that.
[27:15.98]Brand new, blind.
[27:17.68]Here we go.
[27:18.74]If you want to chat, there's another chat going on right now that's currently hosting the stream.
[27:23.53]And also, if I stop speaking... If I stop speaking for, like, an extended period of time and I'm focusing, that probably will happen.
[27:32.81]So, like, don't get, like, angry that I'm not talking.
[27:36.44]I'm trying to enjoy this game, and I'm gonna have fun with it.
[27:39.32]And I hope you guys have fun tagging along and enjoying it with me.
[27:44.30]And with that said, we're going to read the first message of Dark Souls 3.
[27:47.00]I wonder what it is.
[27:47.76]Praise the sun.
[27:49.90]No, it's how to control the game.
[27:51.06]Okay.
[27:54.70]I have not played... Like, the Bloodborne was 30 FPS.
[27:59.04]And that's... This is crazy seeing the Bloodborne engine in 60.
[28:03.35]Oh, I just want to, like, walk around and look at things.
[28:09.79]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:10.75]I don't want to miss any fucking items.
[28:14.49]Oh boy, how do I target on this guy?
[28:16.06]That guy died in one hit.
[28:23.24]Cool.
[28:24.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:26.00]Back step, roll.
[28:27.67]I understand.
[28:28.27]We're gonna go this way because there's an ITAM.
[28:37.01]I want to just hold this in one hand.
[28:39.35]I want to two-hand it.
[28:41.28]Ashen Estus Flask.
[28:44.50]What the hell is that?
[28:47.84]Fill with Estus at bonfire.
[28:49.40]Restores FP.
[28:52.26]Is this Super Mario RPG?
[28:54.06]There's flower points.
[28:57.65]What is... Is FP the new... Looks like a mana potion?
[29:03.37]Okay.
[29:05.75]Alright.
[29:06.81]I got it.
[29:10.67]Let's put the shield back on.
[29:13.54]We're just going to go... I don't like the dual welding.
[29:18.46]Yeah, parry.
[29:20.58]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:23.32]Wait a minute.
[29:23.68]Okay, I got it, I got it.
[29:24.79]We'll try to parry him.
[29:26.61]No, we didn't parry him.
[29:29.93]There we go.
[29:32.15]Okay, put that right into the groinal area.
[29:41.67]So where am I supposed to be?
[29:44.88]Wait a second.
[29:45.58]What the fuck was that?
[29:48.72]They added, like, aerials?
[29:51.48]What?
[29:53.20]Since when can you do that?
[29:54.58]Oh, here we go!
[29:58.06]Remember Dark Souls?
[29:59.08]Hey guys, remember Dark Souls that you can do, like, fucking circus cartwheels?
[30:05.27]That's supposed to be a kick, by the way.
[30:10.93]What is that supposed to do?
[30:11.63]I'm gonna try that on this guy.
[30:13.35]What does it do?
[30:18.22]Oh, it just kind of like bounces back.
[30:21.30]It's like a dodge without a dodge.
[30:25.00]That's a... Okay.
[30:25.90]Interesting.
[30:30.23]Is that... That's a weapon art.
[30:31.41]Alright.
[30:32.09]Okay.
[30:33.29]Okay.
[30:37.47]Yeah, that's... I'm going to go back and look at the other thing.
[30:41.54]Two hand... Yeah, that's what I wanted to do.
[30:45.19]Left trigger while two-handing.
[30:46.46]Use right weapon skills.
[30:51.06]I'm gonna take this off.
[30:51.78]Where's the other sword?
[30:56.63]Oh, it's just twin blades.
[30:58.73]Okay.
[30:59.15]It's not one sword or two sword.
[31:00.61]I actually just have them both on.
[31:03.65]Interesting.
[31:05.05]So what does left trigger do with this?
[31:07.38]Okay.
[31:10.34]Jeez.
[31:17.33]Trying to figure out what these do.
[31:20.67]Fading soul.
[31:21.31]So this is the weapon arts then, huh?
[31:24.53]Use right weapon skills.
[31:26.33]Let me look at that.
[31:35.42]Hayden Latte.
[31:37.44]Hayden Latte.
[31:38.26]What's going on, dude?
[31:40.04]Skill.
[31:40.66]Spin slash.
[31:41.44]Slice into foes with a large spinning motion and continue spinning to transition to a strong attack.
[31:47.54]So I'm assuming that's... Okay, that's fucking wow.
[31:52.52]Wowie.
[31:53.70]All I gotta say is wowie, guys.
[31:55.32]That was cool.
[31:57.43]I can do it.
[31:57.85]Let's do this.
[31:59.33]Oh, whoa, hold on, hold on.
[32:00.35]We'll slow down here.
[32:01.61]I'm using the blue bar.
[32:02.37]The blue bar is actually being consumed when I do that move.
[32:08.25]So I don't think I'm gonna do it.
[32:12.21]Critical hit behind an enemy.
[32:13.31]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:14.15]Actually, I'm gonna go back here.
[32:19.40]The day one patch is not downloading?
[32:22.01]Do I even have the day one patch?
[32:23.43]I'm not even sure I do.
[32:29.95]I'm going to explore.
[32:31.01]I'm going to take it slow.
[32:33.87]Soul of a deserted corpse.
[32:34.84]I'm assuming that is... I'm going to say yes, it probably is.
[32:39.22]Used to acquire souls.
[32:40.14]Used to acquire a smidgen of souls.
[32:43.86]That seems kind of dumb.
[32:47.30]So this is... That's just the PvP stuff.
[32:50.66]Alright, here we go.
[32:53.52]I'm going back to... I'm actually not a huge fan of the two-handers, like I said.
[32:58.97]It's like a hundred megabytes and it's just flat out knocked down.
[33:01.45]When I first put the game on, I couldn't download any patches or anything, so... Make sure I didn't miss anything over here.
[33:10.03]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[33:14.66]Lethal Spoon.
[33:15.58]Welcome back.
[33:16.00]I don't think I even went up this way.
[33:21.30]Gotta get every item.
[33:22.34]Gotta do everything.
[33:24.00]Pick up everything, explore every single area.
[33:30.51]Links are not blocked for subs.
[33:32.49]As long as it is related to the game or the conversation.
[33:36.35]And it is not worse than I'd say like PG-13.
[33:41.46]You can post a link if you are a subscriber.
[33:43.84]Wow, this is cool.
[33:46.92]What a view.
[33:47.34]Don't fall off.
[33:52.06]How come nobody did like a... What a view.
[33:56.00]Somebody should have wrote, what a view.
[33:58.60]Yeah, fun.
[33:59.52]Oh boy.
[34:01.42]Oh boy!
[34:03.50]We have crashed, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:06.30]Dark Souls 2 has stopped working.
[34:10.14]Uh, hold on.
[34:13.82]Where's my image?
[34:16.12]Uh, texture map failed.
[34:19.67]Okay.
[34:24.15]Well, that's, uh... That was interesting.
[34:33.29]Hopefully I didn't lose any data.
[34:36.76]I can hear myself talking now, too.
[34:45.30]Right at the very beginning.
[34:46.72]I looked at the first bonfire and it was like, you lose.
[34:50.53]Sorry.
[34:50.93]I had to make my character again.
[35:02.11]Tuba George.
[35:03.11]Welcome, thanks man.
[35:05.69]Uh, alright.
[35:06.92]If that happens again... Um... I don't really know what to say about it.
[35:11.44]I'm sorry.
[35:12.48]But... We... This is where we got to last time.
[35:15.46]I walked over to the bonfire and I got like a texture map crash.
[35:20.20]Don't do it again.
[35:20.74]Don't do it again.
[35:21.22]Don't do it again.
[35:21.74]Don't do it again.
[35:22.22]Ah, okay.
[35:23.96]We're good.
[35:27.82]I'm actually going to drop the audio a little bit.
[35:30.50]It's a little loud.
[35:37.73]Just a tad.
[35:42.05]Okay.
[35:43.49]Uh, let's get our... Now, do I have to go to leave?
[35:49.48]I guess there's nothing I can do.
[35:52.04]Alrighty.
[35:53.28]Let's keep moving, I guess.
[35:57.34]What's down here?
[36:04.47]Now you guys take two hits.
[36:05.57]Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
[36:09.95]I guess we'll go down.
[36:11.21]Let's see what's down here.
[36:22.00]Hey, guys.
[36:24.09]My Jerma's hot girlfriend just subscribed.
[36:26.65]Oh, wowee.
[36:28.11]Why are we doing wowee?
[36:29.35]What's wowee today?
[36:31.67]Parry that?
[36:39.56]Come on!
[36:41.38]Oh, fucking just die!
[36:42.40]I'm trying to like learn the parrying timing, but I guess we'll just not die.
[36:56.15]Five fire bombs.
[36:57.15]Anything else I can do?
[37:00.09]I just keep seeing glimpses of his face.
[37:03.25]I'm actually gonna get the Estus Flask back and rest again.
[37:14.21]Maybe I'll put the firebombs on.
[37:15.37]Ah, well, let me just kill these guys first.
[37:25.14]Oh, dude behind me.
[37:26.60]And that dude ain't dead.
[37:32.24]Okay.
[37:36.35]Well...
[37:38.57]Now these ragdolls are crazy.
[37:40.71]I want that Estus Flask.
[37:42.89]Wait, I have to... I jumped down.
[37:44.89]Right, right, right.
[37:45.45]I jumped down.
[37:48.19]Bloodstains.
[37:49.74]Maybe I can't get back up there.
[37:53.22]Yeah, I can.
[37:59.36]Give me back my flask, please.
[38:06.50]Three more dudes to deal with, I think.
[38:07.90]I don't like this weapon.
[38:10.45]I want a different weapon.
[38:21.18]Ah, I gotta see who just subbed.
[38:24.02]That was... Halverson.
[38:26.74]Stig Halverson.
[38:29.09]Welcome.
[38:29.45]Thanks for subbing.
[38:35.68]I like the jumping attack of it, though.
[38:36.82]It's got a good slash.
[38:38.14]Cleric's Sacred Chime.
[38:39.58]Is that a weapon?
[38:45.56]It is.
[38:49.57]It is a strength weapon?
[38:51.43]Or no, it's an arcane.
[38:52.75]I guess you can shoot lightning and shit.
[38:56.17]We're not doing that.
[38:57.13]We're not doing that.
[38:58.35]This first playthrough is going to be pretty standard.
[39:04.54]Oh, you gotta click in to jump.
[39:06.20]It's not like Bloodborne, where you double tapped.
[39:10.88]Ah, fuck.
[39:11.36]That's gonna take some getting used to.
[39:15.04]Okay.
[39:15.44]Because I'm used... In Bloodborne, when you do the double tap, you jump instead of roll.
[39:19.73]So I definitely want to get back up there and get that item.
[39:30.41]Was it like that in Dark Souls 2?
[39:31.29]I don't really remember.
[39:38.23]Combat feels really fluid, though.
[39:39.93]That's for sure.
[39:47.20]Gotta get that item.
[39:47.94]It's definitely like a Souls.
[39:49.74]It's definitely a Souls item.
[39:53.56]So, okay.
[39:54.14]Run and then middle stick.
[39:56.10]Oh, boy.
[39:56.54]That's kind of... That's really odd.
[40:00.25]You do like a... Hold on.
[40:02.13]I gotta get used to that right now.
[40:05.49]It's almost like you're not jumping far.
[40:06.87]You like jump in the air and then you just kind of stop.
[40:09.94]Like, here we go.
[40:10.48]No, I'm going to stop right there.
[40:11.40]That is weird.
[40:17.00]That is weird.
[40:30.23]Man.
[40:33.01]Alright.
[40:37.17]It's hard to gauge it.
[40:40.73]Feels like my character starts to jump, and then the game just, like... Like, I'm playing Mario Kart for Super Nintendo.
[40:46.62]The game just, like, starts to move, rather than my character moving.
[40:49.52]I mean, is it... Could it be armor?
[40:55.17]I don't think so.
[40:55.69]Would it be that?
[40:56.43]What's my equipment load?
[40:58.29]27 out of 50.
[40:59.89]Well, let's just, like, remove, like, a couple things and see how much different it is.
[41:05.80]I don't think it's much different.
[41:11.76]It's just really odd.
[41:12.77]Oh, there's a shard.
[41:14.41]Good thing I did that.
[41:15.71]My, like, shmeagle character.
[41:16.81]Because you fat roll once you get to... What is it?
[41:26.82]Is it 50% or 60%?
[41:30.58]I don't know.
[41:31.18]I forget what the number actually is.
[41:32.60]Oh, fuck.
[41:33.30]I almost just crashed right there.
[41:34.66]You know what it is?
[41:35.14]It's the auto-save feature.
[41:37.32]Something to do with the auto-save feature is... Potentially crashing the game.
[41:41.12]Because every time I see that little flame in the top right, it's like... Hold on a second.
[41:45.55]Loading.
[41:45.85]Alright, let's go.
[41:52.25]Am I like a boss already?
[41:55.89]Is this a bad guy?
[42:01.54]I think that might be a bad guy.
[42:02.78]Or it could be an NPC.
[42:04.06]Let me explore the area first.
[42:06.12]I feel like... Okay.
[42:12.46]Okay.
[42:13.00]You're... Hi.
[42:13.67]What's going on?
[42:20.73]There's like a parasite on this guy.
[42:24.90]Remove sword.
[42:26.36]It's just like the lion and the mouse.
[42:28.50]See, now he's going to be really happy.
[42:29.82]He's going to be like, oh, thank you.
[42:31.23]You got rid of the thorn in my foot.
[42:34.23]Now I'll be your friend, young mouse.
[42:37.61]He's not my friend.
[42:38.39]That guy's not my friend.
[42:39.67]There's a boss.
[42:41.17]The first boss already?
[42:44.87]Boss card?
[42:45.51]Can you believe this shit?
[42:49.88]Okay, okie dokie.
[42:56.20]Let's just kind of move around.
[42:59.07]See what he does.
[42:59.71]There's a punch.
[43:02.71]You're supposed to be the lion that's grateful for me taking that out of you.
[43:18.58]Easy.
[43:26.12]Back it up, back it up.
[43:28.64]I'm out of Estus flasks, so I'm probably just gonna die here.
[43:38.69]This guy's movements are so odd.
[43:41.81]He's like on a marionette.
[43:56.11]Goddamn.
[43:58.63]Oh, I'm dead.
[43:59.97]Rage, I'm done.
[44:01.29]I'm not playing this game again.
[44:02.19]I didn't expect that.
[44:12.11]Yeah, this is two-handing it, by the way.
[44:13.97]There's somebody asking in chat if I can two-hand it.
[44:16.68]This is two-handing it.
[44:20.09]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[44:24.05]Laddie596, thanks dude.
[44:24.95]Alright, well now I know what happens there.
[44:28.80]I don't have to be scared when it happens.
[44:30.52]Listen to me son!
[44:39.04]I'm your dad!
[44:41.46]Destroy him!
[44:44.08]Ragglefrack!
[44:46.52]Welcome Ragglefrack, thanks for something.
[44:50.82]Man, I'm surprised there's a boss this quick, right next to the first bonfire of the game.
[44:56.10]I guess Dark Souls 1 did that too.
[44:59.18]This boss seems a little bit more difficult than the Asylum Demon though.
[45:04.73]Alright, let's try it again.
[45:11.57]Damn.
[45:13.49]I'm gonna stay to his right.
[45:16.57]Oh boy, that doesn't help.
[45:21.97]Jeez.
[45:33.36]I'm already out of flasks again.
[45:49.19]You are too awkward for me, man.
[45:50.81]I'm actually getting the hang of it.
[46:05.37]Ooh, see ya.
[46:06.73]Wait, he's back.
[46:07.76]He's back.
[46:09.50]What's he doing?
[46:10.50]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[46:14.50]What the?
[46:15.86]He's like an alligator.
[46:17.24]Oh, I'm like looking at the box.
[46:23.28]Okay.
[46:24.72]He turns into an alligator sperm.
[46:33.21]Alrighty.
[46:34.55]Good to know.
[46:36.83]I think I can... I don't think I should need to use a flask at his first phase, though.
[46:43.51]Oh, wowee.
[46:46.33]Wowee!
[46:59.44]Oh fuck, I forgot you were here.
[47:03.13]Another death counter.
[47:08.15]Alright.
[47:09.15]So obviously I can beat the absolute crap out of him when he does that.
[47:20.87]I think the guy's gonna get hit by that damn
[47:51.22]I missed, fuck.
[47:54.70]Okay, you slow down there.
[48:08.33]No!
[48:08.59]I was a little late, fuck.
[48:12.42]Okay, here we go.
[48:13.70]He's gonna do it.
[48:15.60]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[48:18.76]Do it!
[48:19.80]Get down!
[48:24.38]Get down on your knees, a devil you love.
[48:25.84]What?
[48:25.94]He didn't do it this time.
[48:26.58]I wasn't hurting him there?
[48:29.20]What the fuck?
[48:33.39]Take the drink, take the drink, please!
[48:36.41]Where am I?
[48:44.29]Jeez.
[48:49.43]Wait, I'm probably gonna die again.
[48:56.95]Shit.
[49:01.43]He's like too much person.
[49:02.55]No, I didn't want to do a backflip.
[49:20.62]Oh, what's he doing?
[49:21.91]Ah, shit.
[49:24.85]Alright, I got him closer that time.
[49:28.51]How did I stagger him before?
[49:35.90]I got like a right on him.
[49:46.25]He's too much person.
[49:48.03]He really was.
[50:00.66]Let's try it again.
[50:08.05]Why sub mode?
[50:08.74]I do not want any spoilers!
[50:32.16]Trying to grab me there.
[50:39.95]Maybe I should do like the spin move.
[50:47.61]That wasn't that smart.
[51:12.09]Yikes
[51:42.88]That first one didn't hurt.
[51:51.90]Do a jump again.
[51:52.60]Whoo!
[52:11.17]We're having fun here tonight, boys!
[52:12.97]Alright, he's dead.
[52:18.34]He was just too much person.
[52:19.62]Coiled sword, huh?
[52:21.26]Okay, that's a lot of souls.
[52:27.30]Don't die.
[52:32.55]Let me look at that sword, though.
[52:34.21]I'm getting a little... Where is it?
[52:38.54]What?
[52:40.25]Where's my coiled sword?
[52:46.25]That's not even a weapon, that's a key!
[52:49.25]Oh, what?
[52:53.75]I thought it was gonna be, like, my first weapon.
[52:56.95]Oh, whatever, okay.
[52:59.43]There's a bonfire right here, and I can pick these up.
[53:02.21]Just a quest item, whatever, that's fine.
[53:05.72]Alright, please don't crash, because I don't want to fight that guy again.
[53:14.99]Alright.
[53:16.49]Now, can you level up at bonfires or no?
[53:18.47]You just have to, like, go in.
[53:19.71]It's probably, like, the first area.
[53:20.79]Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.
[53:22.33]It crashed.
[53:23.64]It crashed.
[53:25.04]It crashed.
[53:26.24]We're crashed.
[53:27.20]The stream's probably gonna end.
[53:30.20]Oh, come on.
[53:31.84]Don't even tell me.
[53:34.09]Hold on, can I, like... Let me, like, get off of it.
[53:36.63]Can I get off of it?
[53:38.23]Nope.
[53:39.25]I think we're about to leave.
[53:41.14]Yeah, guys.
[53:42.38]Because when it crashes, it takes OBS with it.
[53:44.72]So... All I have is about five seconds.
[53:51.66]Change your lighting settings?
[53:52.66]I'm going to drop everything to, like, medium.
[53:55.75]I'll be right back.
[53:57.69]What a great launch!
[53:58.89]Great launch, Dark Souls!
[54:00.23]Great launch, fucking Bamkai Namco!
[54:07.23]Are we still live?
[54:10.70]Uh... I've kind of just had a white screen.
[54:18.56]Can I, like, just delete this?
[54:25.04]Yeah, Nam... Namkai... Namkai Bando.
[54:28.25]Good job.
[54:30.95]Namkai Bando with the great thing that it is doing here.
[54:36.77]Alright, yeah, this stream's going to end because it's... I'll be right back.
[54:41.21]Alright, we're going to drop some graphic settings.
[54:58.96]Let's see if that helps at all.
[55:06.17]Uh, motion blur.
[55:09.93]Lighting quality low.
[55:20.64]Whatever.
[55:23.80]Maybe that'll help.
[55:31.91]Low, low, low, low, low.
[55:36.56]I mean, what the heck?
[55:41.27]Oh.
[55:42.13]Namkai- Namkai Bando.
[55:44.19]Malin Brando.
[55:45.17]Good job, guys.
[55:48.85]You only had, like, an extra fucking three weeks before the, you know, your worldwide release.
[56:08.89]Continue, I guess.
[56:10.46]Let's hope it doesn't happen again.
[56:19.64]All we can do is hope, right?
[56:21.10]Whoa, game freaking out.
[56:23.10]All I can do is hope that it doesn't happen again.
[56:24.90]I'm sorry that you have to deal with this.
[56:29.03]But, uh, I don't know.
[56:31.67]Turn shadows off.
[56:34.91]I mean, I, like, actually, I can't play games like that without shadows.
[56:38.53]I feel like I'm playing World of Warcraft on my old computer.
[56:45.10]Alright, there's gotta be, like, an item.
[56:46.22]A secret item, right?
[56:49.40]Come on, I gotta be, like, the first streamer to get the secret item.
[56:52.56]Because then everybody will think I'm so cool and they'll be so happy for me.
[56:56.84]And I can make, like, a video that says, like, first ever secret.
[56:59.80]I'm gonna fall through the Earth.
[57:02.82]I'm, like, kind of scared to move right now.
[57:06.82]Okay.
[57:09.02]I'll just go in the front door.
[57:13.20]Reddit has been saying that all classes except Knight crash at bonfires.
[57:17.69]What?
[57:19.29]What an oddly specific dumb thing that you would think they would have known existed.
[57:36.25]Okay.
[57:37.77]Why am I, like, on fire?
[57:39.91]I almost just crashed again.
[57:43.92]Eek!
[57:45.84]Eek!
[57:49.46]Broken straight sword.
[57:56.46]Uh, this doesn't scale.
[57:57.40]This scales better.
[57:58.10]I feel like this is gonna be good for a while.
[58:06.75]No, some items.
[58:17.30]I thought he was seriously just gonna walk up the edge.
[58:20.24]I'm like, what an idiot, right?
[58:21.78]Somebody come up behind me.
[58:23.22]Alright, I swear to god I thought someone was behind me.
[58:31.37]Can you put down your shield, please?
[58:33.17]Oh, whatever.
[58:35.83]No, I actually I am not a fan of that left right bumper move Gotholic thanks, dude.
[58:49.28]Alright.
[58:49.66]I'm gonna I'm gonna go over one thing.
[58:50.92]I'm gonna have to rebind this because When I'm swinging right and moving around with right bumper Forward and right bumper is the cartwheel
[59:00.52]So if I'm like, swing, swing, swing, hold on, I'm gonna do like a cartwheel for a second.
[59:04.56]Like I'm moving my like controller around to get like a better position.
[59:08.56]I don't like how that's bound.
[59:11.12]I feel like I'm doing unnecessary random cartwheels for no reason because I'm moving the stick.
[59:14.86]I feel like, why am I just on fire?
[59:21.69]Am I like cursed?
[59:23.07]Am I cursed right now?
[59:29.10]Game's gonna crash on rebinds?
[59:30.78]Oh, great.
[59:33.30]Maybe I won't.
[59:33.90]Okay, let's just keep going.
[59:52.10]The next area, out of the tutorial zone.
[59:55.02]Praise the sun, there it is.
[59:56.02]This is your first praise the sun.
[59:58.06]You knew it was gonna happen somewhere.
[60:03.30]Hi guys!
[60:17.99]They actually hit me with that.
[60:20.27]What a good shot.
[60:33.43]Ah, another one?
[60:35.75]There's no sun.
[60:37.79]This is dark and dreary.
[60:38.89]There's no sun here.
[60:45.11]I should be careful, though, because I do have a bunch of souls.
[60:49.72]Wow!
[60:50.38]I didn't even have a chance to read it.
[60:52.90]See?
[60:53.80]Stop doing that!
[60:54.72]Stop doing a fucking cartwheel!
[60:58.16]I really hate that.
[61:00.62]Can I, like, unbind the cartwheel?
[61:04.92]Forward and swing is cartwheel.
[61:07.92]And you... Like, that is so bad.
[61:10.04]I have to get rid of that.
[61:10.91]I'm gonna have to make that something else.
[61:22.17]Let's take a look at it.
[61:22.95]Like, can I change it to something that's not very bad?
[61:26.97]Okay, where is it?
[61:35.91]Attack... Would it be movement?
[61:41.62]Or would it be like special?
[61:42.48]Because it's right bumper.
[61:44.20]And forward.
[61:47.49]Oh god.
[61:51.77]I'm not sure I can change it.
[61:54.09]I think maybe it's just for this item.
[61:58.92]Maybe not.
[62:01.81]Do I steal cartwheel like this?
[62:03.33]My goodness.
[62:04.13]That's going to get me fucking killed, guys.
[62:07.71]Let me turn... Oh, here we go.
[62:09.05]Let me give you an example.
[62:10.45]Swing in this way.
[62:11.35]Hold on.
[62:11.57]A guy came up behind me.
[62:13.46]Hold on.
[62:13.68]Let me just cartwheel.
[62:15.32]I didn't do it that time.
[62:16.02]You should get the idea.
[62:19.52]That's just going to randomly happen.
[62:23.16]Listen to me, son.
[62:24.46]I'm an ember.
[62:25.63]I'm your dad.
[62:28.07]Destroy!
[62:30.57]yellow kuru thanks for seven dude that's a scary looking skeleton dog Michael thanks I think I just called you Michael I said Michael thanks I don't know why and warty finger blaster welcome what's with you guys are sitting around
[63:04.76]Once I get a different weapon, I shouldn't cartwheel spin dodge.
[63:07.00]Okay.
[63:08.70]Because I really don't like it at all.
[63:11.21]I don't like it.
[63:12.63]Complain, complain, complain.
[63:18.39]How do I pull up the mini-map?
[63:21.39]Where's my GTA arrow?
[63:23.91]My GPS breadcrumbs on the ground.
[63:27.21]I think we're safe to go in now.
[63:28.92]Just go in the front door.
[63:35.09]I'm going to assume this opens up the coiled key.
[63:39.12]Or the coiled sword.
[63:40.22]Probably stick it in the door and it opens and lights on fire and all that stuff.
[63:46.76]I'm sure it's really cool.
[63:48.10]I bet you it's really cool.
[63:58.60]Solo 504.
[63:59.78]What's up?
[64:01.22]Hey, here's the shrine.
[64:02.30]Firelink Shrine.
[64:03.80]I made it!
[64:07.66]It's actually really cool looking.
[64:12.42]Glad to see that they reused the gravestones from Bloodborne.
[64:17.77]Especially this one over here.
[64:19.23]That's like a Bloodborne tombstone.
[64:24.99]Okay.
[64:25.98]Let's talk to the blind lady.
[64:27.12]Mm-hmm.
[64:34.89]I tend to the flame, and tend to thee.
[64:38.95]Cool.
[64:41.10]The lords have left their thrones, and must be delivered to them.
[64:45.88]Wow, we're using assets.
[64:47.58]To this end, I am at thy side.
[64:49.00]That's good.
[64:50.34]Bloodborne's, uh... Bloodborne's assets were great.
[64:54.64]So this is the level up lady.
[64:57.78]Take nourishment from these sovereign-less souls.
[65:00.52]Does anybody have a cure for, like, the stone curse that I have on me right now?
[65:06.09]Alright, we're going to do... This is important.
[65:07.81]We're going to do... What's luck?
[65:12.67]Luck?
[65:16.44]Item discovery and lightning and dark resistance?
[65:22.44]Okay, so you can put points into luck and you'll find more shit.
[65:27.79]Not doing faith.
[65:29.13]That's for... Other thing.
[65:31.95]No intelligence.
[65:32.99]I'm going to be a moron.
[65:36.08]Dexterity, though, we're gonna do.
[65:37.20]How many points can I do?
[65:37.90]Let's go to 18 dex.
[65:39.20]And vitality is a... Ooh, vitality is only equipment load, huh?
[65:47.36]Because didn't it used to give you HP as well?
[65:52.36]Dark Souls 2, I think I remember that.
[65:53.77]Attunement.
[65:55.85]It's FP.
[65:56.67]Endurance, obviously.
[65:59.97]We'll do one on Endurance.
[66:01.31]And then one on... Vigor!
[66:03.65]Vigor!
[66:11.20]Tinfoil blind lady.
[66:14.54]Thank you.
[66:16.38]The frog Tusken Raiders will thank you forever.
[66:19.06]I'm gonna fucking just... I'm doing it.
[66:22.89]I'm doing it.
[66:23.29]I'm just gonna kill her.
[66:23.99]I'm doing it.
[66:25.55]Oh, the urge.
[66:26.25]I just have to.
[66:27.25]I have to kill her.
[66:28.73]Just kidding.
[66:29.91]I got you.
[66:32.35]Thank God the Blacksmith is just over here.
[66:35.48]Because I don't have to go to, like, across the world to see him.
[66:38.40]Aye, a wizard.
[66:39.70]Five months.
[66:40.12]He's a pirate.
[66:55.07]It's really just like Captain Blackbeard.
[66:57.33]Dr. Screwball.
[66:58.23]Dr. Screwball Jones.
[66:58.89]Thanks for something.
[67:20.24]Okay, I don't know what any of this shit means.
[67:21.70]I know what this means, and I don't... I kind of know what this means.
[67:27.93]Find gem?
[67:28.61]What is this, like... Is this the new, like, adding elemental damage?
[67:33.77]Oh, what?
[67:34.35]Estus.
[67:37.39]Oh, boy!
[67:40.91]Yeah, gimme all of them.
[67:42.71]Is that gonna... Does this cost me anything?
[67:44.37]Or can I just do this?
[67:45.53]Because I kind of don't care about that.
[67:47.09]I'd rather have the extra Estus Blast.
[67:50.12]Hopefully I can't only do this one time.
[67:52.94]I'm scared.
[67:53.34]Okay, I just did it.
[67:59.59]Okay, that's awesome.
[68:00.99]So I don't even care about that other potion at the moment, so.
[68:02.91]Nothing to repair, reinforce.
[68:07.77]Actually, yeah, I have one, right?
[68:15.74]Okay.
[68:16.60]What else do you got in here?
[68:25.07]You got anything I can smash for insurance money?
[68:32.83]You can just do it whenever.
[68:33.51]That's good.
[68:35.37]I guess that kind of helps if you're just doing like a pure caster build.
[68:39.98]But then again, you will take like a shitload of damage, won't you?
[68:49.14]Kind of came down here for no reason.
[68:52.14]Looking for secret doors.
[68:58.76]Who's this guy?
[68:59.80]Rockblue, thanks for the two months.
[69:08.09]Ah, another one, roused from the sleep of death.
[69:12.22]Well, you're not alone.
[69:13.10]Unkindled.
[69:14.04]We unkindled are worthless.
[69:17.32]Can't even die right.
[69:18.82]Gives me conniptions.
[69:20.24]And they'd have us seek the Lords of Cinder and return them to their molding... Can I stop being on fire?
[69:25.50]I'm, like, on fire this whole entire time.
[69:27.18]But we're talking true legends, with the metal to link the fire.
[69:33.94]We're not fit to lick their boots.
[69:36.80]Okay, well, thanks for the... Thanks for the gesture.
[69:43.65]What a sick joke.
[69:45.27]Asking us to seek the Lords of Cinder.
[69:48.43]They're talking true legends.
[69:50.53]Those who would link... I know you have to talk to... Dark Souls, talk to everybody.
[69:56.13]Talk to him a bunch of times and you can do a quest for him.
[69:58.41]What a sick... Asking... What a sick... Asking...
[70:06.25]Okay.
[70:06.85]He didn't have anything for me to do.
[70:11.03]Sure.
[70:13.13]We get to go to Lothric.
[70:14.71]Okay, put the sword in the stone.
[70:16.57]Excalibur.
[70:16.85]Where's Merlin?
[70:41.53]Time for death.
[70:42.65]Yeah.
[70:44.85]You'd be right.
[70:47.91]Burn undead bone shard.
[70:49.53]Is that the same thing as... Strengthening my Estus.
[70:53.80]Organize storage box.
[70:54.74]Attune spell travel.
[70:58.34]High Wall of Lothric.
[71:00.00]Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything upstairs.
[71:08.02]You know, they like to hide things on you in these games.
[71:10.80]Not gonna get it past me.
[71:16.80]Yeah, you will.
[71:18.02]Because there's nothing here.
[71:19.86]What's that?
[71:21.90]Holy King Lothric.
[71:23.44]Last hope of his line.
[71:27.44]Oh, would you just shut up?
[71:34.12]I like how this is like a hub here.
[71:36.79]Dark Souls 2's hub was kind of annoying.
[71:41.03]Dark Souls 1 didn't really have a hub with a million people standing around it that I remember.
[71:46.40]This reminds me of Bloodborne.
[71:47.76]That's a good thing.
[71:49.58]I really liked that game a lot.
[71:59.19]Flaming Gumby is my favorite character.
[72:12.75]Alright.
[72:14.01]Let the games begin.
[72:17.43]Let the games begin.
[72:23.67]I'm too scared.
[72:26.37]You've used the key.
[72:27.63]King Lothric's Coiled Dump.
[72:32.98]This is nice looking.
[72:35.50]High wall of Lothric.
[72:36.44]Look at that.
[72:38.18]Very pretty.
[72:39.26]Time for guts.
[72:44.97]That was fun.
[72:48.17]Probably gonna get invaded, too.
[72:49.33]That'll be fun, won't it?
[72:53.63]Bonfire!
[72:54.30]Oh, creepy.
[73:04.10]Will Bloodborne come to PC?
[73:07.20]I would say, with almost all certainty, 100% no.
[73:11.91]Demon's Souls never came to PC, so I would assume Bloodborne would not come to PC either.
[73:17.25]What is that noise?
[73:20.37]Did you guys hear that?
[73:20.93]It's like a spooky ghost.
[73:25.81]Nothing over here?
[73:26.35]Come on.
[73:34.78]We can go down and look over here.
[73:41.00]Here we go!
[73:52.27]Oh boy, a lot of guys here.
[73:53.65]I don't like the second hit.
[74:03.93]Rather just swing and be done with it, you know?
[74:13.12]That's a pretty good statue impression this guy was doing.
[74:15.12]Is that a dragon up there?
[74:25.43]I'm gonna stab him in his... That's very satisfying.
[74:43.92]I can just do it to all of them.
[74:45.88]I don't have to do anything.
[74:46.78]Hi, how you doing?
[74:51.72]I'm the guy that sticks the sword.
[74:53.02]Up you... You know, you get the idea.
[75:03.95]Candles.
[75:06.05]Ooh, look at that.
[75:07.29]It is a dragon.
[75:12.73]Wake up!
[75:14.55]Wake up!
[75:18.09]Creepy, but cool.
[75:21.63]Try up first.
[75:29.08]Don't do that, don't do that, don't do that!
[75:30.42]Yeah, you call everybody, of course you do.
[75:34.06]Somebody's throwing bombs.
[75:37.24]Somebody's throwing bombs.
[75:41.67]Come down here.
[75:42.19]I'm not going to get comboed with a fire bomb.
[75:49.31]What was with that accuracy?
[75:50.69]Good thing that wasn't a ledge.
[76:05.32]Anybody else?
[76:11.15]I'm running up there and just killing that guy right now.
[76:15.29]Your bomb throwing days are over.
[76:21.05]What was that like floating?
[76:26.57]Oh god.
[76:27.35]I probably should have killed the guy with the lantern first, huh?
[76:37.28]Get out of here.
[76:46.23]No, stab him in his butt!
[76:52.03]Yeah!
[76:58.06]What about you?
[77:02.24]I wanted to stab him in his back.
[77:04.74]Alright, let's take a moment to compose ourselves.
[77:10.97]I'm going to assume there's probably something under here.
[77:13.12]No, no item there.
[77:20.66]No item there.
[77:21.68]There's got to be something right there, right?
[77:35.71]Come on.
[77:37.69]Yeah, there it is.
[77:39.41]Gold pine resin.
[77:42.34]Not going in this room yet.
[77:43.42]I want to explore the rest of the up.
[77:45.22]The up.
[77:45.82]Wait, no, I have to go in this room.
[77:47.98]Oh, no, there's no ladder.
[77:50.84]Where's my ladder?
[77:51.56]Okay, assess the situation before you do anything dumb.
[78:04.03]Probably shouldn't have made that much noise.
[78:09.79]Made a little too much noise there.
[78:19.25]I'm gonna stay with the shield.
[78:20.27]I feel like I like using it more.
[78:25.89]Alright, fine.
[78:30.85]I'll destroy this whole room, Berkish.
[78:37.34]Thanks for subbing.
[78:38.32]You did this, Berkish, man.
[78:39.90]You made me destroy them.
[78:47.49]Why is there items hidden in the...
[78:50.89]Around the edges there.
[78:52.35]I could go down.
[78:56.31]Can't really do anything about this.
[78:58.21]Oh, look at all those items.
[79:00.51]I want to do that.
[79:04.62]What do you want to tell me?
[79:06.16]Be wary of mob enemy.
[79:10.26]We're not going to do that now.
[79:15.32]Come up here.
[79:16.10]Can I go around?
[79:20.78]Will I be able to drop down this way?
[79:22.80]If I go up and down, up and down, up and down?
[79:27.40]I didn't go this way.
[79:34.06]Ooh.
[79:36.22]Binoculars!
[79:40.06]Oh, I can see.
[79:41.82]What's going on, Shrivel?
[79:49.37]Thanks for stopping.
[79:49.93]Welcome.
[79:52.07]A lot of praise the rolling.
[79:53.73]Rolling required ahead.
[79:54.71]I just did it.
[79:55.51]Why don't I get it?
[79:56.17]Is that a joke one?
[79:58.47]Are you trying to joke with me?
[80:02.07]I can't be opened.
[80:03.76]There's no point in coming up here besides to get that one thing.
[80:10.64]I want to go down there.
[80:13.68]Maybe I can just wrap around from the bottom, I would assume.
[80:22.21]Yeah, I guess we'll go back to the room I was in.
[80:29.31]Go down and around.
[80:30.55]Where's it gonna go down?
[80:38.12]Be careful on the ladder, there might be scary monsters!
[80:43.06]Just go, just go, go!
[80:46.05]Gotta be prepared for anything.
[80:46.95]You're gonna slide down.
[80:53.35]Oh, that was my best hat.
[81:02.30]Hey, my best hat.
[81:03.24]Thanks for subbing.
[81:03.78]Welcome.
[81:05.68]That was my best hat.
[81:06.90]I want to get behind you.
[81:21.70]You're not making that easy for me, are you?
[81:26.46]Straight ahead.
[81:29.70]Did you like that move?
[81:31.72]No!
[81:32.47]God damn it!
[81:33.35]Don't do that!
[81:42.55]Whoa.
[81:43.35]That was odd.
[81:49.80]Fuck.
[82:07.98]Come on!
[82:16.27]Whatever, I'm gonna parry.
[82:19.68]I've seen a lot of Jupiters in the chat.
[82:31.57]Ah, yeah, yeah, you got reach.
[82:33.97]You've got a big shield, too.
[82:35.37]Oh, a big shield welder.
[82:41.39]I want to lure this guy out and kill the guy with the bow and arrow.
[82:44.31]Crossbow, because he's going to be a pain in my ass.
[82:47.58]Come on.
[82:48.94]Oh, whatever.
[82:49.42]Screw you.
[82:55.88]Now I can take care of you.
[83:06.90]Better Mixmaster!
[83:09.92]Mixmaster, what's going on?
[83:10.88]Thanks for the reset.
[83:15.30]I'm out of... I'm out of healing.
[83:21.13]Be very careful.
[83:26.07]That's a new enemy.
[83:27.23]Get the item and run.
[83:30.25]Give me the item.
[83:33.57]I'm freaking out.
[83:34.55]Somebody subscribe.
[83:35.89]Literally... Hold on.
[83:37.27]I can't read it yet.
[83:40.41]This is for the money.
[83:41.85]This is for the money.
[83:42.43]Give me the money.
[83:44.79]I didn't get the money.
[83:54.45]I thought I was going to get it.
[84:06.65]I didn't even go down here.
[84:08.59]So many ways to go.
[84:15.04]Bankrupt.
[84:16.14]Yeah, no, I did bankrupt myself.
[84:19.08]Let's keep progressing that way.
[84:22.76]Now, if I don't attack these guys, will they even stand up?
[84:27.74]I don't think so.
[84:28.35]Maybe they'll just keep standing around.
[84:37.24]Now, that was a mistake, because now, thank God they didn't stand up.
[84:40.42]Okay, so as long as you don't... As long as the guy doesn't ring the bell, you're fine.
[84:48.86]But in a room like this, I'd like to just clear it.
[85:01.06]I forgot to sub.
[85:03.02]It was literally Malon, right?
[85:04.50]Didn't I say his name really quickly?
[85:06.60]And then had to run away?
[85:18.10]Stabbed them all.
[85:20.10]Alright, we're back here.
[85:20.92]We can just get down here quick.
[85:22.88]Let's pick up my stuff.
[85:29.37]And kill that guy.
[85:32.14]Oh, I'm gonna burp.
[85:33.26]It's gonna happen.
[85:33.76]I'm really sorry.
[85:36.87]Oh, we're okay.
[85:37.49]We're good.
[85:42.89]Actually hit me with that.
[85:43.57]I didn't kill him.
[85:49.71]I was straight ahead.
[85:58.54]This hallway sucks.
[86:02.08]This always sucks.
[86:03.00]Because you have to kill these dudes.
[86:04.60]He did a third smoke.
[86:11.68]Shit.
[86:15.38]Raw gem.
[86:18.56]Okay.
[86:29.77]That was not sneaky at all.
[86:31.81]I thought I could sprint up and stab him.
[86:35.51]Looks like I got rid of most of these.
[86:43.59]I feel like that's really loud too, by the way.
[86:45.25]Is it?
[86:53.76]How do I like it so far?
[86:55.52]Um, I think it's great.
[86:57.26]I mean, I've only, I mean, I've done like the first tutorial boss and just haven't even got through Lothric area.
[87:02.18]But, what a moron.
[87:06.24]What a dumb guy.
[87:12.18]Let me turn that down.
[87:15.20]Hope nobody hits me right now.
[87:18.44]Would not be good.
[87:22.26]Maybe that's a little better.
[87:29.61]There are my souls.
[87:32.21]Haha.
[87:32.69]Alright.
[87:35.47]Now, let's get rid of the big dude that's up here.
[87:44.26]Mono e mono.
[87:49.96]Okay.
[87:50.82]You are fast.
[88:02.03]The shield bash, dude.
[88:10.20]I'm trying to, like, parry.
[88:11.48]Wow!
[88:13.22]Wow!
[88:21.21]I just pulled that guy, too.
[88:26.09]Shit.
[88:27.87]There we go, I got it.
[88:32.09]While you're on the ground, let me kill this guy.
[88:35.01]Alright, he's dead.
[88:49.27]He was not easy.
[88:50.13]That guy was kind of tough.
[88:50.87]Might as well just farm souls for free, right?
[89:00.93]There's a second Titanfall?
[89:04.25]Really?
[89:06.21]Why?
[89:08.77]Is there... Is there really a need for that?
[89:14.00]This looks like... Some kind of shortcut?
[89:19.96]Can't get it from this side.
[89:20.94]Huh, where is that?
[89:26.70]That's not the room I was in before, is it?
[89:28.86]No...
[89:31.03]I'm just gonna keep going this way.
[89:32.13]Of course they do a walk the plank beam.
[89:53.36]Remember guys, this is a Dark Souls game.
[89:55.74]You have to walk the plank to get an item at least five to ten times.
[90:06.04]What do we got down there?
[90:13.38]Man, there are a lot of areas to go.
[90:14.82]Ooh, a bonfire.
[90:20.10]Hey, hey, hey, look out front of me.
[90:21.98]Hey, hey.
[90:23.20]I'm going to go level up.
[90:43.52]No, whoops.
[90:44.48]I didn't want to go here.
[90:46.44]For some reason, I thought that going up and over... It's okay.
[90:48.88]This is a different little menu.
[91:01.29]I have... I can break open those things that I've been picking up.
[91:06.29]Smidgen.
[91:06.79]What is this?
[91:07.21]Let's find out.
[91:07.67]What's a smidgen?
[91:11.25]That is a smidgen.
[91:15.05]50 souls.
[91:15.71]That sure is a smidgen.
[91:17.11]I can do them all.
[91:17.75]I just want to... Is it a different button to do them all at the same time?
[91:23.90]Use selected.
[91:24.44]There we go.
[91:28.98]Oh, crash!
[91:37.56]Alright.
[91:38.96]Wait, where's the lady?
[91:42.73]There you are.
[91:43.88]I don't want to touch the darkness with you.
[91:46.74]Uh... We'll do one, two, three.
[91:47.76]Oh, I can't do three.
[92:11.32]So the soft caps, there are soft caps and hard caps.
[92:14.70]I'm gonna assume they're probably very similar.
[92:21.64]Is that mist up here that I see?
[92:26.14]What the fuck is this?
[92:30.42]Huh?
[92:33.80]This looks like a boss door.
[92:36.22]Or is it just supposed to be fog machine?
[92:37.70]Okay, whatever.
[92:45.68]Alright, so I have the second bonfire here.
[92:48.93]Tower on the wall.
[92:49.85]We're just going to keep going this way.
[93:02.09]Frog machine.
[93:02.71]It kind of was a frog machine.
[93:06.04]Keeps me away.
[93:14.76]Can I go up?
[93:21.48]I'm like making frog noises.
[93:22.82]You guys hear this?
[93:23.50]It's like... So I guess there's nothing to do over here, huh?
[93:32.32]Invisible door?
[93:34.56]Oh, come on.
[93:37.00]Oh, come on.
[93:40.60]Okay.
[93:43.04]Whatever you say, game.
[93:44.63]I'm inclined to listen.
[93:50.85]This just must be a little bonfire to... Oh, he's back.
[93:54.57]Shit.
[93:56.25]I can go down.
[93:57.99]I really don't want to fight that guy right now, so we're just going to drop and attack.
[94:05.87]Just barely got that.
[94:06.72]I didn't think I actually got it.
[94:09.62]This room's got a lot of shit, so we're going to fly around.
[94:23.37]Knives Anymore stuff to destroy Yeah, that's actually it is Uranus disguised as an egg Fuck I think the guy saw me and he's dropping down here right now Maybe not God I thought that was a person that was an enemy
[94:57.85]Something that I have noticed in the first, like, hour of this game.
[95:02.15]There are a ton of levels to these areas.
[95:04.44]Like, where am I now?
[95:07.40]I'm like, there's so much to see and do in this first area.
[95:13.54]Game almost crashed, by the way.
[95:23.80]That's very forgiving.
[95:32.16]Where do you end up over here?
[95:34.06]Where am I?
[95:34.66]I'm like up on top of the rooftops?
[95:43.48]One could get real lost in this first area.
[95:47.44]Okay.
[95:50.40]Kind of need to remember.
[95:51.30]I'm like starting to forget like the backtracking.
[95:54.60]Where I was and where I need to be.
[96:04.65]Okay, I'll go back up the ladder.
[96:05.75]Go back up the ladder.
[96:06.77]Just go back up the ladder for a second.
[96:09.04]Just go, go up the ladder.
[96:10.42]Get up the ladder.
[96:11.04]Go, go, go, go.
[96:11.94]Oh my god.
[96:17.84]What the hell?
[96:21.78]Hey, at least he killed the enemies for me.
[96:24.29]Okay, I gotta be prepared for this one.
[96:30.29]It's like the first boss.
[96:33.97]Why the Los Plagas in this game?
[96:35.67]Is this Resident Evil 4?
[96:48.67]Okay, which one of his arms or face or back is attacking?
[96:55.02]He comes in and I can't even tell which one of his appendages is actually attacking.
[97:04.19]You know what I mean?
[97:04.65]He's just like slugging around.
[97:06.49]That's so hard to tell what he's actually swinging at you with.
[97:16.36]Oh my god.
[97:18.92]Alrighty.
[97:20.74]Let me close this door.
[97:28.47]The guy fucking deadfished me.
[97:36.07]Alright, I'm going to do some shield tactics on this guy.
[97:39.57]I feel like it might be easier.
[97:43.95]Wait for you to leave.
[97:47.12]Drop down on this guy.
[97:47.98]Can I drop down on you?
[97:48.80]Come on.
[97:49.76]Give me a lock on.
[97:51.72]Give me a lock on.
[97:57.48]Tight night shot on this one random dude.
[98:05.25]Ah, that was a mistake.
[98:11.95]Okay, so we're going to name those enemies the Dead Fishers.
[98:19.39]That's a new person.
[98:20.58]Why am I going down?
[98:22.46]Wait a minute.
[98:22.80]I can open that.
[98:24.04]I can open that.
[98:24.50]It's going to be tactical.
[98:28.52]Here we go.
[98:31.70]I didn't get it.
[98:35.77]What the fuck was that swing?
[98:38.19]What was that swing, dude?
[98:50.03]Fuck my face!
[98:52.59]Sorry.
[98:53.17]Excuse me.
[98:53.61]Excuse me.
[99:00.39]Alright.
[99:02.61]Um... Open this door.
[99:06.48]It's locked, of course it is.
[99:10.92]I wonder if I should go this way or not.
[99:26.32]Ooh, there's an ITAM.
[99:27.70]Did you guys see that ITAM?
[99:38.12]Haha, another ITAM.
[99:39.08]There's way more stuff to break in this game, I think, than any of the other Dark Souls or Bloodborne combined.
[99:53.57]Alright, is somebody going to be in here?
[99:55.47]Just scared the fucking shit out of me.
[100:02.67]Taco Badger.
[100:03.87]Thanks for something.
[100:04.48]You're welcome.
[100:08.94]Mail Breaker.
[100:09.50]That's a new weapon.
[100:10.14]I want to look at that and see what the difference is.
[100:16.33]I might put it on.
[100:19.59]75 plus 6.
[100:19.97]99 plus 7.
[100:21.01]This is just so much more damage.
[100:25.84]Shield Spiller.
[100:26.42]Aim carefully and attack in a large forward lunge to pierce through enemy shields and inflict damage directly.
[100:35.90]I just want to put it on for a second.
[100:37.68]See what the swing is like.
[100:38.64]I actually like it.
[100:46.00]So, how do I do the, uh... Does it be holding it in two hands?
[100:51.66]Yeah, like that.
[100:57.10]Okay, you kind of look like a dickhead when you use this thing.
[101:04.36]I'm going to use this for a little bit.
[101:09.78]Mosley Bird, thanks for something.
[101:11.22]Welcome.
[101:13.88]I like how fast it is.
[101:14.78]I'll give it a go.
[101:17.33]There's even further to go.
[101:21.77]Is anybody else as lost as I am?
[101:27.97]Remember back at that first bonfire?
[101:30.03]There was another direction to go.
[101:32.03]An entire different direction.
[101:35.67]This can be broken, obviously.
[101:38.73]Really?
[101:41.31]Can't be.
[101:41.85]Okay.
[101:49.89]Locked.
[101:50.21]There's a dude in there.
[101:52.55]Okay, well, remember where that is.
[102:01.43]This looks like the end of this way to go.
[102:04.10]Eventually I get a key, I guess.
[102:07.60]And I can unlock the dude with the weird mask on.
[102:10.74]Bugs.
[102:11.12]Bug.
[102:11.32]Look at that bug.
[102:12.74]Report the bug.
[102:21.04]I guess we're going back up to the alien.
[102:23.06]I still need to get my souls, too.
[102:31.95]What are you doing?
[102:35.32]Drop down.
[102:35.94]Get down here.
[102:38.08]Will you just get down here?
[102:41.77]You know I'm here.
[102:42.73]You were just throwing knives at me, dude.
[102:48.29]Fine, I'll come to you.
[102:51.48]Where's the other guy?
[102:55.62]You knew I was coming up the stairs, too.
[103:02.40]You're not that smart, are you?
[103:03.58]Okay, I'm doing shield here.
[103:08.92]I'm going to try to just eat some of this damage.
[103:10.92]I forgot about this dude.
[103:17.32]Shit.
[103:21.13]Shit.
[103:35.07]I have no Estus Blasts.
[103:36.69]Too busy exploring.
[103:49.88]When in doubt, just stunlock the hell out of him.
[103:56.28]Thanks, Tanchuma.
[104:01.83]Tanchu MA.
[104:03.47]Tanchu Massachusetts.
[104:06.36]Whatever you go by.
[104:09.35]Thanks for subbing.
[104:10.19]But this is... I'm probably going to die here again.
[104:12.01]I just want the souls and running.
[104:19.49]No.
[104:19.55]We don't run.
[104:20.01]We don't run.
[104:23.01]No running.
[104:23.53]You didn't kill that guy yet.
[104:24.59]That guy's still alive.
[104:28.84]Holy shit.
[104:29.76]Alright, back to bed.
[104:41.62]Fuck you.
[104:43.28]You can't kill me.
[104:44.52]I'm above you.
[104:45.50]Hey, thanks, sly161.
[104:48.26]Do I have any, like, just Crunch Berry heals?
[104:58.21]I don't.
[104:59.98]Hold on a second.
[105:01.04]Might be time to cheeseball him.
[105:03.60]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[105:06.42]Yeah, there's a resub too.
[105:07.84]Mr. Beef.
[105:09.96]I'm gonna just rain hell on this guy.
[105:16.37]Ooh, does it sting?
[105:17.97]Ooh, it stings.
[105:19.69]Oh, this one.
[105:21.35]Oh boy, it hurts, doesn't it?
[105:28.27]He's kind of just like, alright, I'm out of here.
[105:30.06]I'm sick of this fire shit.
[105:33.76]Well, I'm kind of too big to move around, though.
[105:37.80]I didn't kill this one guy.
[105:39.04]I like this guy.
[105:40.40]He's my friend.
[105:43.38]He's my one worshiper that's allowed to stay alive.
[105:46.36]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[105:52.20]Shredded Cheese Man, welcome back.
[105:53.36]Two months.
[105:54.24]Thanks a lot.
[105:55.00]Thanks a lot.
[105:55.70]Thanks a lot.
[106:09.30]What a coward.
[106:10.00]I'm such a coward.
[106:13.36]Now he's pissed off again.
[106:14.38]I'm just irritating him.
[106:24.86]I'm back!
[106:26.60]Oh no!
[106:27.68]I'm back again!
[106:28.24]Hey, I'm back a third time!
[106:33.30]Just like that, you kill the annoying spam enemy.
[106:38.27]It was worth it, Titanite Shard.
[106:43.84]Lizard ahead.
[106:46.80]Fuck.
[106:48.50]How did you... How did you survive that?
[106:50.70]I need to just go back, I think.
[107:01.48]Gonna lose everything.
[107:03.84]I have no health.
[107:05.20]This is not a good idea.
[107:08.82]A jewel bug!
[107:12.22]Come here!
[107:17.22]Come here!
[107:20.94]Hit it!
[107:24.54]Get over here!
[107:28.07]Don't disappear!
[107:28.95]Thank God.
[107:31.43]I don't even know what I picked up.
[107:36.02]It was like a... It had to have been like a gem or something.
[107:38.16]I was too busy spamming it.
[107:44.14]And there's an item down there too.
[107:49.60]This weapon sucks.
[107:52.05]I like was not hurting that thing at all.
[108:00.73]I've made a decision.
[108:01.49]I'm going to stick with it.
[108:02.35]Ooh, that's a large soul.
[108:10.02]Oh, that's a big guy with a halberd.
[108:13.28]I don't know if that's a good idea to go down there just yet.
[108:16.62]There's a ladder.
[108:17.16]Can I kick it?
[108:17.80]I was hoping... Oh, there's an item over there.
[108:23.26]I got the jewel bug.
[108:24.00]I just hope nothing attacks me right now and just jumps on my head.
[108:33.36]Oh, duh!
[108:34.54]Okay.
[108:39.40]Alright, take this fucking thing off.
[108:41.52]Take this thing off.
[108:42.33]I'm doing like 25 damage.
[108:44.07]No, no, no.
[108:45.35]Which way?
[108:46.13]Which way is the safe way?
[108:47.41]Which way is the safe way?
[108:48.43]Up.
[108:49.15]Go.
[108:50.09]Get up there.
[108:50.95]Get safe.
[108:56.27]It went through my legs.
[109:00.22]It went through my legs.
[109:01.68]It went through my legs.
[109:04.48]What?
[109:07.32]I need a second.
[109:08.04]Hold on.
[109:08.90]Sergeant Chickenwing, thanks.
[109:12.57]I can hear footsteps right now.
[109:20.26]Okay, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go back.
[109:23.58]Get this fucking thing off.
[109:24.70]This thing's stupid.
[109:25.68]I'm not even hurting anything for some reason.
[109:33.21]Yeah, there's no point in me going down there.
[109:36.39]I have some more souls I can level up once or twice.
[109:38.99]So, hopefully I don't see any enemies on the way back.
[109:52.09]Destroy him!
[109:56.09]I'm so paranoid right now that I missed an enemy.
[109:58.27]I'm going to die here.
[110:04.40]The bonfire is... I don't remember.
[110:10.94]I think it's up.
[110:13.16]Nope.
[110:13.88]It's down this way because I'm very wrapped around.
[110:15.60]Right?
[110:18.77]Yeah.
[110:21.23]Yeah.
[110:21.71]Yeah.
[110:22.93]No, it's not.
[110:28.57]Shit.
[110:29.31]It's up and around and up and through the loop.
[110:33.95]I'm so scared right now.
[110:35.09]I could just take the homeward bump, but what a waste.
[110:36.99]I'm like right here.
[110:37.69]It's not even worth doing.
[110:39.49]Probably need to just go up.
[110:42.57]There's two bonfires, but it didn't kill the guy.
[110:48.68]Which way?
[110:49.22]Um...
[110:58.72]Isn't it over here?
[110:59.36]Oh, thank God!
[111:06.50]Praise the almighty toothpick?
[111:09.66]No, that... I... That thing sucks.
[111:16.00]You subbed so I could get a Dunkin' Donuts coffee on you.
[111:18.21]Well, hey!
[111:21.67]Ah, thanks.
[111:23.21]I just sprayed that.
[111:24.99]All over my glasses.
[111:26.99]And all over my microphone.
[111:31.40]That's not good.
[111:32.98]That is not good.
[111:36.52]That shot out like a snot rocket.
[111:40.10]Directly into my microphone.
[111:43.49]Well, if you guys stop hearing me talk, then I broke my microphone.
[111:52.41]Here's hoping it didn't.
[111:59.42]Jerma wears glasses.
[112:00.32]I do now.
[112:02.24]But I don't like them.
[112:04.00]Just because I wear them doesn't mean I have to like them.
[112:07.25]Alright, I need 1600 after this.
[112:17.13]Go another point in dexterity.
[112:18.70]We want to be doing massive damage.
[112:24.21]So 1,600.
[112:24.53]Can I get there with the souls that I picked up?
[112:27.15]Because I put one in endurance.
[112:28.61]Or HP.
[112:29.63]Health.
[112:35.44]User requires souls.
[112:36.40]How many, though?
[112:39.80]I don't... If it's because it's like 1,000 or something, I might not be able to do it.
[112:46.17]So I'm going to hold on to it because I don't want to use it and not be able to level up and have to potentially lose them down here.
[112:53.66]Alright.
[112:55.34]Same deal, we're gonna travel back to the tower and try to go that way.
[112:59.95]Of the 200 ways to go in the first hour of this game.
[113:10.65]Oh, yah, yahoo, wahoo.
[113:12.45]Let's go.
[113:14.45]I know where I'm going.
[113:15.96]Wait, I'm gonna have to fight that... ...slug black oil monster, aren't I, again?
[113:23.56]That actually hurt me.
[113:31.50]That actually hurt.
[113:33.52]I don't believe it for a second.
[113:34.72]Alright, so... This way...
[113:51.60]Shit.
[113:52.68]What if I just run by him?
[113:54.50]I really don't like that enemy.
[113:58.30]Where the hell did you come from?
[113:59.25]Fucking god damn it.
[114:04.59]Both of you two morons.
[114:12.30]He's wasted an Estus Blast.
[114:13.68]I have to fight this guy again.
[114:16.30]I hope not.
[114:16.98]Do I?
[114:17.24]Yeah, I do.
[114:19.40]Well, I'm just going to go by him.
[114:20.58]I'm going to go this way.
[114:22.21]He's not going to be smart enough to follow me down here.
[114:25.47]At least I don't think he will be.
[114:27.07]That's a far drop.
[114:30.09]I don't think I can make that drop.
[114:36.01]Thanks for the free souls, sucker.
[114:37.45]I was just right on the camera with my big smiling face.
[114:47.88]I could go that way.
[114:53.24]Bye.
[115:00.29]Goddamn.
[115:12.08]You're just gonna back off, aren't you?
[115:17.15]Fall to your death.
[115:18.51]Fall!
[115:20.85]No, give me the... Noooo!
[115:23.95]We had an item.
[115:26.91]Ah, that... that sucks.
[115:33.82]That really sucks.
[115:40.42]Be wary, I've left.
[115:42.59]Told you.
[115:45.99]Shit.
[115:49.96]Well, this is not a great area to fight this guy in.
[115:54.23]See if I can pull him back.
[115:56.49]Come on, you knight of the round table.
[116:07.82]Shit.
[116:08.92]Shit.
[116:10.48]Where am I going?
[116:11.76]Where am I?
[116:12.06]Where am I going?
[116:13.20]What am I doing?
[116:15.32]Such a bad place to fight this guy.
[116:17.22]Should've stayed in the room.
[116:20.19]You wanna do shield fight?
[116:21.23]I can do shield fight.
[116:32.57]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[116:38.79]Ah, my lord.
[116:40.99]Can we please go somewhere else?
[116:42.57]I'll take you back in your room.
[116:44.67]But it said ambush, so be careful of an ambush.
[116:46.44]I have to be careful of the ambush.
[116:48.92]It told me to be careful.
[116:49.68]Really?
[116:55.48]Really?
[116:59.60]I'm trying to so desperately fucking kill this dude.
[117:02.88]Okay.
[117:03.96]Okay.
[117:05.28]Whatever.
[117:05.66]I'll take this, whatever it is.
[117:08.26]And I'm just gonna hide here.
[117:09.79]Oh, you shithead.
[117:18.01]This has got to be, like, a better place to fight you.
[117:22.77]What if I just keep going through here?
[117:23.79]Oh, item.
[117:26.90]Oh.
[117:30.89]There's a soul.
[117:32.99]This guy is Michael Myers right now.
[117:34.53]He's just following me.
[117:38.19]Where's this?
[117:41.85]I'm so lost.
[117:46.24]Green blossom.
[117:48.20]Wow!
[117:52.76]Where am I?
[117:53.32]A chest.
[117:58.38]I got a sword.
[117:58.80]Nice.
[117:58.94]Nice.
[118:00.73]Hold on a second, wait, is Jason still following me?
[118:05.38]Where's the Michael Myers music?
[118:06.68]He's probably just gonna drop down right here.
[118:07.98]Actually, that's a new sword, though.
[118:18.95]Ugh.
[118:24.86]I wish it was like... Can I just open a door or something somewhere?
[118:27.00]There's got to be a door to open.
[118:27.88]If I fall... I'm a dog.
[118:30.74]Let me look at the sword first.
[118:36.62]Where is it?
[118:39.70]I need 12 in arcane or faith, whatever.
[118:43.72]This is actually much better, though.
[118:47.75]Should I put the two points in faith to be able to use this, maybe?
[118:50.13]Maybe.
[118:51.85]It just does more damage already.
[118:53.09]99 and 119.
[118:54.07]99, 119.
[118:54.11]99, 19.
[118:54.37]Yeah, I'm going to try it.
[119:04.15]No, I can't do it yet.
[119:06.05]I'll try that shit out.
[119:10.53]For now, though.
[119:11.87]Let's keep getting lost.
[119:17.32]There's not much else choice for me to do at the moment, so... Looks like we're gonna have to just fall to our death.
[119:24.24]Where are the Crunch Berries in this game?
[119:25.85]How come I don't have any Crunch Berries?
[119:29.83]I can see a spot up there.
[119:33.33]There's a lot of people in this room, too.
[119:35.13]Shit.
[119:35.41]Alright, we're gonna do a Swanton Bomb through the table.
[119:50.51]Well, it did damage to me.
[119:51.75]It worked.
[119:55.55]Listen to me, son.
[120:01.98]I'm your dad.
[120:04.38]Destroy him!
[120:07.82]Whoa!
[120:08.46]Boogly Gareth.
[120:09.46]Thanks for something, dude.
[120:17.85]Whoa!
[120:23.74]Good job.
[120:24.93]I didn't really have much of a choice There's nowhere else for me to go right like I was just I just had to jump off and die there No, I don't want to go down here Ding dong ding dong ding dong
[120:49.20]I don't have to fight... Oh, wait.
[120:50.40]Hold on a second.
[120:51.92]The guy that climbs over here.
[120:54.36]There's another guy down here.
[120:55.40]Thankfully, I don't have to fight this monster.
[120:59.45]I know I can just skip him, which is a good thing.
[121:10.80]See you later.
[121:17.88]I see over on the distance back there.
[121:20.01]Now I wonder if it's worth not going that way.
[121:26.61]Maybe just kind of... Can I fall safely over here in the corner?
[121:31.00]Because this is a new area too.
[121:32.62]Let me give it a try.
[121:33.28]There's a little spot I can fall right there.
[121:36.32]Let's do it.
[121:36.80]Why not?
[121:38.92]This is the worst that could happen.
[121:41.24]I get killed by the big giant fat guy.
[121:47.21]Item collecting.
[121:49.23]Don't you know how to be a good thief?
[121:50.69]Just get in and steal and get out.
[121:53.31]There's the rapier.
[122:03.99]Hello.
[122:06.29]Hello.
[122:07.81]Hello.
[122:12.20]Holy shit, that lasts a very long time.
[122:17.30]Not only does he do a whirlwind, he does like three whirlwinds.
[122:30.40]Holy crap.
[122:45.06]Shit.
[122:45.98]That's so hard to tell when he's got, you know, fuck that.
[122:48.16]Fuck this guy, too.
[122:50.82]What is going on?
[122:51.44]Why am I getting electric?
[122:52.25]Where's the lighting coming from?
[122:54.31]What was, what the fuck was that?
[122:58.59]Was that him doing that move?
[123:03.57]I just got shot in the head.
[123:04.87]Oh, God.
[123:06.53]I'm going up this way.
[123:09.39]Just run.
[123:10.55]Just run, just run, just run.
[123:13.73]Uh... What?
[123:15.51]Okay, this is a different spot?
[123:16.83]Different area?
[123:20.38]Uh, shortcut!
[123:22.90]I found a shortcut.
[123:23.66]Thanks for the shortcut.
[123:27.20]Right?
[123:31.64]Uh... Oh, yeah, kind of.
[123:32.98]Yeah, there it is.
[123:35.64]Hey, I can open this door.
[123:39.02]Hey, where does this end up, though?
[123:42.94]Big guy with an axe is where it ends up.
[123:50.72]There's another guy that stood up!
[123:52.14]At least I opened that door, but where is this door?
[124:01.50]Where is that door?
[124:02.34]Where did that even lead to?
[124:03.44]I have absolutely no idea.
[124:13.14]This first area... There's so many places to go.
[124:16.71]I have no idea where that is.
[124:18.83]Not a single fucking clue.
[124:25.27]But... I'm going to try... It's not right there.
[124:31.64]I just want to make sure it wasn't like over here or something.
[124:45.73]Double Jupiter.
[124:46.43]Because this is back at the first area.
[124:49.91]Let's do it.
[124:51.27]Jesus.
[125:03.16]Man, these guys' recovery times, they can swing a shitload.
[125:10.46]They do like their 1, 2, 3, and then they can do it again immediately.
[125:15.24]It's kind of fucking crazy.
[125:24.25]Jesus.
[125:25.75]Those guys are fucked.
[125:46.67]They swing so fast, and it's so hard to kill those guys when there's more than one person.
[125:57.74]I guess I'm gonna have to just keep trying to go that way.
[126:02.69]I don't know.
[126:05.41]I mean, I could try going up.
[126:07.79]I could try the other bonfire.
[126:11.81]But I did open... Let me... I'm just curious.
[126:14.59]Out of curiosity.
[126:15.61]Let's go to the other Lothric Bonfire and go the other way.
[126:28.67]Because there was a... I could go down that way.
[126:32.83]Or I could go the other way.
[126:34.17]And wait a minute.
[126:34.69]That's... Wait a minute.
[126:35.23]Wait a minute.
[126:36.41]Wait a minute.
[126:40.86]This takes me down here.
[126:43.26]Yeah.
[126:43.66]Let's go.
[126:43.98]Let's do this.
[126:46.06]Because I have not gone this way.
[126:49.24]Is anybody getting this?
[127:02.47]Four damage.
[127:08.17]Maybe I went like the harder way first.
[127:11.60]Because, like, isn't this... This isn't this.
[127:18.53]You really shoot at me from up there?
[127:26.83]Can I even get to that guy?
[127:28.71]Hopefully.
[127:30.75]Ooh, almost.
[127:34.01]No items or anything, right?
[127:42.02]Okie dokie.
[127:44.25]There's even more places to go.
[127:45.65]Oh wait, is that where I... Stay stunlocked.
[128:18.23]Why do you have so much health?
[128:22.15]Shouldn't have that much health.
[128:23.73]Nerf him.
[128:24.21]Nerf him.
[128:24.75]Nerf these guys.
[128:28.17]Ooh.
[128:30.17]This is where I died.
[128:32.12]So this is where I opened the door.
[128:33.84]And this is the shortcut.
[128:37.20]So now I have to use that bonfire to come down here.
[128:40.00]Okay.
[128:41.20]Starting to understand things.
[128:50.19]Is it worth, should I keep trying to progress down where I got the skip or should I try to go this way?
[128:56.49]Something tells me I might as well just look.
[128:59.65]I mean, was this back where I came from?
[129:00.93]Be wary of tough enemy.
[129:07.27]Demon ahead.
[129:11.16]Oh, great.
[129:14.22]Great.
[129:15.74]It's not going to be one of those fucking snot monsters again, is it?
[129:18.20]I hope not.
[129:24.31]It is.
[129:24.55]It's a fucking snot monster.
[129:30.49]Oh, shit.
[129:31.23]Me and this guy did the same thing.
[129:32.49]Let's see what he did.
[129:35.62]I can't see because the camera's everywhere.
[129:37.32]Yeah, he tried to hide back here.
[129:41.28]Stupid snot monsters.
[129:46.00]Oh.
[129:52.67]I'm just like, what the fuck is happening?
[129:56.47]How am I supposed to even know what fucking moves he's doing?
[130:02.71]He just did the equivalent of just jumping in the air and kicking and punching in every direction.
[130:09.06]Except this person is like 60 feet long.
[130:13.54]Destroy him!
[130:17.95]Tapio, what's going on?
[130:19.81]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[130:20.83]Welcome.
[130:21.73]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[130:25.47]I, like, I just don't... There must be some way to beat those guys reliably.
[130:29.85]I just have no idea what the hell it is.
[130:33.37]They're so erratic and they fucking insta-kill you if they jump on you like that.
[130:37.02]Uh, am I at the right bonfire?
[130:39.56]Yeah.
[130:45.04]No, and I'm...
[130:48.11]Enemies like that this early in the game?
[130:51.67]That seems kind of insane.
[130:56.93]Whatever.
[130:57.27]Another guy shooting behind me, but... I kind of don't care at the moment.
[131:14.01]I just want to get back to where I was.
[131:17.89]I don't think there's anything else even up there.
[131:19.87]But just for the purpose of checking, I'm gonna look.
[131:23.21]Oh, fuck you.
[131:26.48]Didn't want to do that.
[131:28.44]Didn't want to do that.
[131:29.16]I didn't want to do the fucking cartwheel.
[131:49.97]Just want to take a peek and make sure I didn't miss anything, because now I know that that happens up there.
[131:53.87]Is there anything up here I can do?
[131:57.87]Doesn't look like it.
[131:58.93]Can't go up the stairs, right?
[132:02.15]Nope.
[132:02.97]See ya.
[132:05.51]What about over here?
[132:06.63]Nothing.
[132:08.77]Anything in that corner?
[132:10.74]Don't care.
[132:11.42]Bye-bye.
[132:13.10]If I miss a little item, I miss a little item.
[132:16.06]Can't be that important to go die from the flailing loogie monster.
[132:37.62]No!
[132:38.28]Come on!
[132:39.34]Just out of reach.
[132:47.18]Can you backstab those guys?
[132:48.26]I feel like I was in range of hitting them, but I didn't hit them.
[132:53.47]Well, this is the way to go, I think.
[132:55.13]I have to assume I'm pretty close to something.
[133:10.42]What if the item I forgot was the best item in the game?
[133:12.52]That would suck.
[133:13.08]Alright, well now at least I'm not in a completely dire situation where I'm sprinting around, running away from the knights.
[133:26.87]Let's take it slow.
[133:32.23]Yeah, of course.
[133:34.57]Wow.
[133:39.44]A lot of you guys just decided to stand up right there.
[133:41.44]I've got a feeling one of these big guys is going to stand as well.
[133:50.39]But you can't ever know that, can you?
[133:57.77]Ambush ahead.
[133:59.89]Thanks for the tip.
[134:07.36]I'm so glad that I decided to run in this direction of all the random places I could have ran.
[134:28.53]I see items that I could probably pick up.
[134:35.91]Oh, liar ahead.
[134:36.83]Illusory wall.
[134:38.39]Oh my god.
[134:38.97]Why can't I get it?
[134:40.25]This guy told me there was an illusory wall.
[134:42.96]Why can't I open it?
[134:45.64]Fucking asshole.
[134:53.08]That's where the big spinning guy is.
[134:54.35]I don't really want to deal with him right now.
[135:00.71]More of these guys.
[135:06.52]Look how many directions I can go.
[135:08.08]Are you fucking serious?
[135:10.78]This is a maze.
[135:12.90]This whole place is a maze.
[135:14.51]Pick a door.
[135:16.21]Which way are you going to go?
[135:17.25]And is it going to be a good place to go?
[135:26.21]Goodness.
[135:44.40]When in doubt, go right.
[135:47.12]I don't know.
[135:47.60]There's so much exploring that needs to be done.
[135:56.06]Should I go back that way?
[135:57.32]Maybe open up another door?
[135:58.42]Or walk in the front?
[135:59.58]Walk in the straight big doors?
[136:04.72]I mean, I don't know.
[136:05.50]Listen to me, son!
[136:07.88]I'm your dad!
[136:09.76]Shit.
[136:10.30]Destroy him!
[136:15.74]I didn't parry that.
[136:17.08]Axton Daly thinks of something, dude.
[136:21.13]I have trouble with these.
[136:27.91]Oh, dear.
[136:31.31]We're just going in.
[136:33.51]I don't know what's in here, but we're going in.
[136:36.75]Where's it going?
[136:37.09]We're going in.
[136:38.90]Hi.
[136:42.36]Is it safe in here?
[136:45.14]Uh...
[136:46.15]okay the weight has been long unkindled one I am Emma high priestess of lothric castle run Jerma run you will not find the lords of cinder here they have left gone to their journey homes converging at the base of this castle
[137:09.77]Head to the bottom of the high wall.
[137:12.80]Forge on through the great gate and raise this banner to proceed.
[137:20.44]Okay, I got a banner.
[137:22.54]I'm looking at the chat right now.
[137:24.14]Somebody has like a butterfly Jupiter face.
[137:30.71]So I have to raise the banner at the bottom of Lothric?
[137:34.47]asshole this farewell it is the insignia if you fear trespasses dark spirit then and the old Concord will beckon okay so unkindled one head to the high walls base go through the great gate and raise this banner to proceed at least this but beware the dog keeps a close eye on dogs the vile watchdog of the boreal valley
[138:06.47]Can I go up these stairs?
[138:12.51]Aww.
[138:17.91]So, I have the banner.
[138:21.47]The base of the high wall.
[138:24.95]Don't think there's anything else in here.
[138:27.29]Might actually consider homeward boning.
[138:32.36]Because there's no way I'm making it out of here alive.
[138:40.48]I mean, that's not a huge amount, but... It's enough that I'm probably going to take a hit or two.
[138:47.50]Although, like... Tough enemy.
[138:53.01]This guy's got a blue shirt on.
[139:01.07]Is he an enemy?
[139:01.63]Yeah, he's an enemy.
[139:03.27]Yeah, bye.
[139:06.54]Back to bone.
[139:07.02]I only have one.
[139:09.12]It's not worth it.
[139:10.98]Not worth it.
[139:11.64]I'm killing this guy.
[139:12.42]Watch this.
[139:12.98]First try.
[139:25.22]He freaked me out with the stupid, I'm going to apply magic dust to my weapon.
[139:28.46]I thought he was going to attack.
[139:34.34]Alright, High Wall of Lothric.
[139:36.70]I have the banner.
[139:37.49]Can I just drop it down?
[139:40.15]Like, where do I need to put the banner?
[139:43.87]The bottom of the wall, she said.
[139:45.55]Which wall?
[139:45.95]There's a hundred of them.
[139:48.94]There's so many walls that are a part of this place.
[139:56.36]That area has a lot of hard enemies, too.
[140:00.17]I mean, I just have to keep going down?
[140:09.69]Where are they going?
[140:11.71]What are you guys doing?
[140:17.27]You went all the way through all that trouble.
[140:21.42]I might as well run all the way around.
[140:26.14]I guess I'm just gonna go down again.
[140:28.50]Too bad I have to pull the stupid lever.
[140:36.57]Put this at the base of the high wall.
[140:46.10]Can I grab onto anything here?
[140:49.67]No.
[140:50.39]Sometimes they hide little ledges you can get on.
[140:59.41]Go back to where the jelly man is?
[141:00.63]Maybe.
[141:09.84]I'm just gonna... I'm gonna try going... I'm gonna wrap around here.
[141:12.74]Because wasn't there a... Is there a dog behind me?
[141:21.11]I'm in the middle of a total freakout right now.
[141:24.59]Yeah, I'm in the middle of a freakout.
[141:29.21]Okay, calm down.
[141:33.25]These guys are not aggroing.
[141:34.63]Except for this one.
[141:46.66]That was not a backstab, but I still got it apparently.
[141:50.90]Raw gem.
[141:51.44]Alright, so what if I go down there?
[141:56.02]Just keep going down?
[141:56.82]I went over there.
[141:58.92]I didn't go... There's a strong enemy over there.
[142:01.12]A strong enemy that way.
[142:02.26]Let's go over here.
[142:03.10]Down.
[142:17.90]I feel like someone's going to be behind me now, too.
[142:20.52]I hate the big open areas like this with enemies.
[142:22.98]Here comes another guy.
[142:23.94]Here come all of you.
[142:26.16]Come on, everyone join the party.
[142:29.46]I would really like it if you could attack.
[142:36.60]They're drinking a potion.
[142:39.72]This random moron hollow.
[142:42.00]I was so distracted by that.
[142:45.54]I couldn't believe that a fucking hollow is rigging a potion right now.
[142:50.01]What a crock of shit.
[142:57.38]Stab him in the back!
[143:14.40]I think that looks like a boss area to me.
[143:17.38]I wonder.
[143:17.76]I wonder.
[143:24.20]Did I kill the BA back in the courtyard?
[143:26.24]No, I didn't.
[143:29.56]Nothing over here?
[143:32.98]No reason to have that, huh?
[143:40.22]Check this side.
[143:43.13]A whole lot of nothing.
[143:44.79]I kind of ripped that guy's arm off.
[143:50.91]Where's that armor?
[143:51.87]That's armor.
[143:57.58]Alright, let's keep going down.
[144:03.96]Egg sacs.
[144:06.46]You always gotta be careful when the egg sac enemies come into play.
[144:11.30]Tough enemy ahead.
[144:13.54]I think that's a boss.
[144:16.58]That looks to me like it could be boss material.
[144:23.46]Where did my... Where did I die?
[144:25.30]I don't even... Should I even attempt to grab... If I'm going to be fighting a boss right now... My souls are up there...
[144:36.37]Uh, I'm probably just gonna go up there and die again.
[144:38.80]Might as well just see what's in here.
[144:40.06]If it's a boss, it's a boss.
[144:41.00]See, I lost, like, 1500 souls or something.
[144:45.86]This is definitely a boss room.
[144:48.04]Hello?
[144:50.12]I'd like to speak to the boss that's in here, please.
[144:54.09]Excuse me, boss.
[144:58.87]Cute scene.
[145:03.49]I'm gonna get a good shot of the face.
[145:11.67]But where's that?
[145:13.37]Who's behind me?
[145:18.03]Uh-oh.
[145:21.00]It's the ancient mist dragon.
[145:26.56]He's got a lot of armor.
[145:34.69]Vordt of the Boreal Valley.
[145:37.35]Okay, dude.
[145:39.28]Time to die.
[145:39.97]And I mean me.
[145:41.81]Okay.
[145:47.05]Get a slow attack from... 33 damage.
[145:53.96]Yikes.
[145:55.74]Get a fist punch.
[145:57.34]What else do you do?
[146:00.06]Get an overhead swing.
[146:01.20]Do you do any combos?
[146:05.62]Yes.
[146:08.04]Whoa!
[146:10.06]Hard to tell what that was.
[146:11.14]Where are you, like, what's your soft spot?
[146:29.35]Wait.
[146:30.47]Right in the face, maybe?
[146:36.29]Can't really get behind them very well.
[146:38.12]He just jumps backwards.
[146:42.94]Brenda's like, belly?
[146:49.84]No, still 33 damage.
[146:53.74]That's terrible damage, by the way. 33.
[147:10.42]That one's quick.
[147:12.80]Maybe you just have to be slow.
[147:23.24]Low, dude, do it slow and slow.
[147:25.08]Cook this guy on low and slow.
[147:26.48]That was not even nine.
[147:34.33]No, that's just 33 three times.
[147:44.44]Remember, low and slow.
[147:57.19]Put this dude in the crock pot.
[147:58.93]Put it on low.
[148:00.79]12 hours.
[148:06.53]Might have a phase 2 though, which I'm scared of.
[148:12.58]And looks like this is the phase 2.
[148:15.92]What is it?
[148:17.08]Oh my fucking god!
[148:20.72]What is he doing?
[148:21.28]He's just going around the whole room!
[148:22.42]What is this move?
[148:24.38]What's that move?
[148:25.44]What's that move?
[148:25.96]What's he doing?
[148:28.50]Jeez, they put blow in a wind tunnel.
[148:37.32]Okay, he does- he charges and you gotta- Fuck.
[148:43.97]I'm so dead here.
[148:46.67]it just goes like psycho there he goes
[149:14.24]Fuck, he's going to breathe this stupid shit at me.
[149:17.54]I'm sorry, these people are stubborn.
[149:19.30]Can't talk.
[149:23.60]Shit.
[149:26.24]Alright, I got him this time.
[149:28.76]I got him this time.
[149:33.02]It was that second phase there.
[149:34.18]He just goes nuts.
[149:35.98]That charge.
[149:37.22]I avoided it the second time.
[149:39.97]I should be able to get him now.
[149:43.32]But uh, Mr. Banana!
[149:45.50]Subscribe.
[149:45.96]Somebody else did too.
[149:52.13]Do I have enough?
[149:54.45]I feel like I could get him this next time.
[149:57.13]But man, I am doing no damage to him.
[149:59.09]But I think that's just by design.
[150:00.88]I just don't know how to get to him.
[150:10.18]Let's try this.
[150:10.62]Can I just run?
[150:13.71]Is it worth the just sprinting?
[150:17.45]Oh, wait, wrong way.
[150:19.35]It's down over here.
[150:20.03]I have to get like the skip.
[150:23.47]This might not be a good idea, just sprinting to it.
[150:27.87]Oh, shit, I didn't even call the elevator.
[150:29.34]We're all like having a party in here.
[150:35.04]How am I not taking a hit?
[150:36.70]I haven't taken one hit.
[150:44.05]Where'd the dog go?
[150:49.94]I missed Quill Life's sub.
[150:53.08]Hey Quill Life, thanks for subbing.
[150:54.64]Sorry I missed you.
[150:55.82]I was intently focusing on the giant beetle.
[150:58.50]And then we just go straight down.
[151:11.04]Hello, goodbye.
[151:14.84]Let's say goodbye to this guy.
[151:18.38]Run by these dudes.
[151:20.94]See ya.
[151:24.03]Don't do it!
[151:26.73]Actually, it's kind of an annoying run.
[151:30.07]Alright, let's try it again.
[151:34.01]Try it again.
[151:36.02]Come on, buddy.
[151:52.54]I thought it was going to be the big sweep.
[152:11.19]Silent try hard time.
[152:12.21]That hurt for a lot actually.
[152:20.93]Don't want to use any flasks before phase two.
[152:43.83]I say that now and I'm gonna have to use one.
[152:53.61]There we go.
[152:56.47]I'm not going to even attempt it.
[152:57.31]I just want to dodge the charges.
[153:06.42]One more?
[153:07.02]Nope.
[153:07.54]The fire.
[153:08.74]The big arc.
[153:09.90]Okay, so that should be easy to kill him.
[153:11.70]But I know these things.
[153:16.57]Let's get some distance here.
[153:19.35]Stuck on a tree.
[153:20.03]Not good.
[153:45.96]Man I'm not good here.
[153:50.04]Nah, I'm in trouble here.
[153:50.86]I'm getting too like caught up in the wall He always does it from left to right it seems
[154:04.54]If I wasn't, like, kind of locked in the corner there, this would have been much better.
[154:07.17]Yeah, I'm dead.
[154:16.58]That sucked.
[154:17.74]I got kind of just lodged in the tree in the corner, and that was fucking stupid.
[154:28.48]Of course I gotta put a tree there, right?
[154:31.01]Of all the things.
[154:32.55]Let's just put like a little slab of tree right on this edge.
[154:42.69]I went the wrong way again.
[154:48.64]Yeah, I could coat my weapon.
[154:51.40]But I feel like I could kill him without having to use pine resin.
[154:54.04]I got him pretty close at least that first time.
[155:04.10]Oh, you fucking... You fucking goddamn... I'm just gonna let him kill me.
[155:09.94]I, like, fall down and his weapon is coming down as I'm landing.
[155:17.05]Now, that's the first time I've gotten pissed off at this game so far.
[155:22.31]Legit, I land and his axe is coming down on my head.
[155:26.79]You fucking piece of shit game.
[155:29.91]I'm just gonna start screaming.
[155:35.10]Let me get my zero souls back.
[155:36.34]Alright, here we go.
[155:38.28]Here comes the swing!
[155:40.16]Fuck you.
[155:40.64]He almost got it again.
[155:51.93]I gotta send this back up.
[155:52.83]I keep forgetting to do that.
[155:58.33]I wonder if I can just keep running around.
[156:02.70]You can't get me.
[156:04.60]You can't get me.
[156:06.68]Bye.
[156:09.62]Sucker.
[156:16.28]I didn't think he was going to do that.
[156:19.81]I'm fine.
[156:22.73]I missed a couple of subscribers, didn't I?
[156:26.33]True blue.
[156:26.79]Who was the guy I missed before?
[156:27.87]Before I start the boss fight, I want to say, hey, thanks for subbing.
[156:42.22]Really?
[156:42.98]You're gonna sprint at me like a fucking idiot.
[156:45.84]And just do the, my weapon is glued to your body.
[156:48.68]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[156:54.50]Okay, now I'm gonna... I can't fucking believe I just got hit right there.
[157:01.82]I have to drink a potion already.
[157:05.06]This attempt is absolutely null and void.
[157:07.78]Give me a break.
[157:12.97]Now I'm like, I might as well just let him kill me.
[157:18.33]I don't care.
[157:21.81]Maybe that's the attitude you gotta have.
[157:26.72]He's like way more aggressive right now for some reason.
[157:31.66]You know what I haven't found at all?
[157:33.26]Any armor.
[157:35.36]Usually they have some stuff really early on.
[157:46.47]Commander Steele!
[157:47.45]I saw that one.
[157:48.17]Yeah, this one's done.
[157:53.59]I actually forgot to put the Pine Resin on my bar, too.
[157:57.53]So, I think I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna slowly and sloppily just get killed.
[158:10.80]You're really close, actually.
[158:12.80]Can't seem to hit you if you get that close to his face.
[158:17.28]Oh, that's the strategy.
[158:18.49]Alright, I found the strategy out.
[158:36.55]Just stay underneath his groin.
[158:40.28]Well, that didn't work that time.
[158:41.78]Oh, I'm dead.
[158:42.10]Alright.
[158:43.42]Well, actually, for the first phase, that works pretty well.
[158:46.30]Joey Fatone and Commander Steel, both of you.
[158:49.92]Thanks.
[158:50.86]Welcome, dudes.
[158:51.34]Alright.
[158:55.31]Let me put Pine Resin on my bar.
[159:01.25]I have Lightning.
[159:03.67]I'm going to give it a try.
[159:11.63]That works at least for the first phase.
[159:16.99]Not so much the second, because he flails around a lot in the second phase.
[159:21.83]Did I go the wrong way again?
[159:22.67]No.
[159:26.47]Where is he?
[159:31.41]Is he not stood up yet?
[159:32.57]Isn't he usually right here?
[159:34.31]Oh, he's gone up the stairs.
[159:40.48]Wow.
[159:41.16]God.
[159:41.70]Wow.
[159:43.26]Wow.
[159:47.04]Wowie.
[159:48.82]As we say.
[159:50.28]Wowie.
[160:04.10]Don't be glued to me.
[160:05.22]Don't be a magnet enemy.
[160:07.12]Nobody likes a magnet enemy.
[160:19.19]Alright, let's do it.
[160:25.58]Lightning time.
[160:40.64]Not that much of a difference, really.
[160:46.74]I mean, it's good, but... Actually, it is pretty good.
[160:49.66]Kind of whooping his fucking ass.
[161:18.70]Whoa!
[161:20.58]Drink the drink!
[161:23.74]What, are you fucking crazy?
[161:34.57]Wow!
[161:42.59]Get out of my face!
[161:43.59]Woo!
[161:44.15]Hoo!
[161:44.73]Hoo!
[161:45.21]Hoo!
[161:46.77]Hahaha!
[161:49.47]I made him.
[161:50.10]Yay, he's dead.
[161:50.92]I got him.
[161:59.21]People coming down the stairs now.
[162:00.15]I'm scared.
[162:00.55]Let me go get my zero souls.
[162:07.13]Man, lightning really just destroyed them.
[162:16.41]Come on, let's get some, let's, come on.
[162:18.09]I'll fight you.
[162:18.83]I just beat the boss.
[162:19.55]You're nothing compared to the boss.
[162:22.41]I just did two cartwheels in a row.
[162:31.06]Yeah, I had like one touch of HP.
[162:35.38]Listen to me, son.
[162:37.88]I'm your dad.
[162:39.00]That was good.
[162:40.30]Destroy him!
[162:44.27]Enunciate, thanks for subbing.
[162:45.57]It doesn't make that much of a difference.
[162:47.11]Yeah, it's only like 100% more damage.
[162:53.81]Today I learned 80 equals 0.
[162:56.35]It was like 80.
[162:57.00]That's nothing.
[162:58.10]Okay.
[163:01.72]So, I don't know if it's worth holding onto these.
[163:05.00]Because I don't know what you get for an item.
[163:06.62]Because can't you hand these into somebody?
[163:12.32]And get free stuff.
[163:16.74]You can.
[163:18.96]But I don't know.
[163:20.12]Let's go level up.
[163:27.05]Now, there is a completely other way to go here.
[163:30.49]I came down these stairs and over here, but wasn't there a completely other way to go?
[163:33.19]I don't know.
[163:39.05]I'm going to hold on to it.
[163:39.99]For now.
[163:50.33]1800.
[163:54.02]Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up.
[163:58.84]Okay.
[164:04.96]How many of those do I have?
[164:06.94]Large soul.
[164:07.78]I'm probably going to get there.
[164:10.52]Let's see.
[164:10.88]Give me 1800.
[164:11.12]Yep.
[164:11.37]Perfect.
[164:14.67]Is it enough?
[164:15.33]Okay.
[164:19.13]18 and some change.
[164:20.31]Yeah.
[164:21.47]Have to do the other one.
[164:22.45]Look at that.
[164:32.64]Welcome.
[164:33.02]Must be very well taken.
[164:40.58]Maybe I should put a couple points into strength.
[164:42.82]Just because down the road needing to... Oh, you know what?
[164:46.95]Faith.
[164:48.45]To be able to put on that weapon.
[164:51.01]You need 12 faith.
[164:57.48]Can't go wrong putting it in dexterity right now.
[165:03.20]Let me take a look at those items.
[165:09.20]Rapier.
[165:12.35]That one is a little bit better scaling.
[165:15.49]95, 21, 99.
[165:16.73]It's very negligible.
[165:19.01]It weighs a lot less, too.
[165:25.02]Hmm.
[165:29.96]The rapier is always just in a straight line, though.
[165:31.84]I don't... In any of the Souls games, I never like using the rapier.
[165:37.99]I like being able to crest with a cleave attack.
[165:41.91]And being 100% right in front of your face.
[165:45.69]Not a big fan of it.
[165:47.35]But what is the... Move... Oh, shit.
[165:51.67]What's the move?
[165:56.73]Skill stance.
[165:57.35]From stance, use normal attack to backstep and execute a surprise attack.
[166:01.70]Or strong attack for consecutive thrusting.
[166:06.42]Uh...
[166:12.31]Okay.
[166:14.47]You kind of just move around like you're in a 1900 duel with somebody.
[166:21.63]Oh, wait a minute.
[166:22.65]Wait just a minute.
[166:28.21]That's kind of cool.
[166:30.49]Kind of cool.
[166:37.22]We're going to do the thing where we give it a try for about five minutes.
[166:40.88]If I don't like it, I don't like it.
[166:43.74]Ah, it is good to see what needs.
[166:45.72]Oh, I need an Estus Shard.
[166:55.05]I mean, should I just... The shards drop like candy.
[167:09.31]Every time I play one of these games, I have so much trouble with the deciding factor on what I'm going to upgrade.
[167:17.70]And I always hold on to upgrades for so long that it gimps the shit out of my character.
[167:24.16]But I just... No, I don't want to spend it on there.
[167:25.90]Because what if I find the Legendary Flamesword of the Ancient Dragon?
[167:28.65]What if I find that?
[167:35.61]Well, then you're going to have to deal with it.
[167:43.48]1900.
[167:43.50]Seems really hard to hit.
[167:45.24]I like the cleave, Hypo.
[167:46.84]The cleave is my favorite part.
[167:49.78]Being able to miss and not have this one tiny window in front of you helps a lot.
[167:56.54]And in fact, I kind of want to go back here.
[168:00.40]Let no leaf be unturned.
[168:05.70]That's not the same.
[168:08.92]No leaf?
[168:09.92]Alright, on guard, matey, on guard!
[168:12.62]Have at you!
[168:20.51]Alright, now let's actually fight this guy.
[168:25.99]I like it!
[168:26.55]Ooh, that's a helmet.
[168:28.97]Hey.
[168:31.83]Fuck off!
[168:44.37]I feel like the rapier is always just like a great item in these games.
[168:53.56]Will you do something, please?
[168:55.00]Do something!
[168:56.94]Do something!
[168:57.46]Stop looking at me!
[169:11.61]Yeah, we are gonna go take a couple looksies over here.
[169:14.69]Because there is a huge area I did not see.
[169:25.68]Finally backstabbed this guy.
[169:27.30]First time in a thousand years.
[169:34.38]oh shit in my fucking pants really guys I'm gonna call your friend I had the same idea oh my god why are you making this so difficult do you have to this s this blast sucks by the way listen to me son I'm your dad Jesus destroy him whoa
[170:01.90]Swear guy for Jerma Rumble.
[170:04.00]Just subscribe.
[170:04.76]We'll have to see about that.
[170:09.68]I'm all gone.
[170:11.08]All my shit is just gone.
[170:18.48]I have such trouble fighting these guys.
[170:19.92]I just can't get over how much they can attack.
[170:24.20]That guy got up and he was angry.
[170:28.22]He swung like 15 fucking times in a row.
[170:37.35]It's like they don't even have a stamina bar.
[170:39.83]Those guys can just attack infinite amount of times.
[170:42.61]You have like a quarter of a second window to attack those knights.
[170:54.86]Come on, you bastard.
[170:57.94]Come on, you bastard.
[170:58.89]Swing.
[171:03.35]That wasn't a backstab.
[171:05.81]Somebody pull up the encyclopedia and tell me how I did not backstab that guy.
[171:09.12]I'd love to see it.
[171:09.98]That one is.
[171:21.83]Killjoy?
[171:22.69]Welcome, Killjoy.
[171:24.03]Whoa!
[171:37.09]This time, pull back.
[171:38.45]I don't want to pull this guy, too.
[171:40.91]Come on.
[171:41.89]Thank God he's running.
[171:46.09]Come on, that's not a backstab.
[171:47.90]Why?
[171:55.94]Am I just not quick enough?
[171:58.58]I have to be quick enough.
[172:02.99]There we are.
[172:18.12]How did you block that with the shield?
[172:33.81]You fucking dickheads with these shields.
[172:37.59]That's so annoying.
[172:41.82]Like I can only get you in one little spot.
[172:46.62]Jesus.
[172:51.81]Sit down.
[172:53.93]You're hotter than the boss.
[173:04.32]Ooh.
[173:05.52]Do you see that?
[173:05.88]Item.
[173:07.26]I thought that was a skeleton.
[173:13.68]No, it's just a phantom.
[173:15.29]Ooh, that's a weapon.
[173:16.39]Weapon, weapon, weapon, guys.
[173:17.49]New weapon, new weapon.
[173:19.16]I can't wait to look at it.
[173:20.08]I can't wait to unwrap it from the wrapping paper.
[173:21.60]I like the little stabby stab.
[173:41.84]Oh, stabby stab.
[173:46.97]Poopy butt fart.
[173:49.16]Poopy butt fart.
[173:51.22]Just subscribed.
[173:53.08]I like doing little stabby stab.
[173:54.20]Oh, stabby stabby TF2 spy.
[173:57.16]Stabby stab.
[173:58.38]The TF2 professional spy.
[174:02.39]Stabby stabby.
[174:03.71]The Team Fortress 2 spy professional pro player.
[174:07.97]There he is.
[174:14.17]Mr. Poopy Fart Butt.
[174:16.61]Let's look at what that is.
[174:20.55]This is a very heavy weapon.
[174:26.56]15, 13.
[174:27.14]Actually, I put a couple points into strength.
[174:30.60]I might check this out.
[174:34.89]For the time being, we're going to stay rapier.
[174:39.35]This guy actually kind of does look like Mr. Sneak Man.
[174:45.77]I'm glad I came back here to get that at least.
[174:52.31]Okay, it's time for my revenge on this guy, guys.
[174:56.27]Top it off.
[174:57.30]Get a burp out.
[175:00.68]Revenge time.
[175:03.98]He's gonna go lightning.
[175:08.18]Where's your lightning?
[175:20.57]See how far he just went.
[175:22.25]My goodness.
[175:25.16]Perfect time to backstab him.
[175:31.32]Fuck your magic sword.
[175:44.17]Almost one hundo.
[175:47.35]He almost one hundoed me.
[176:10.35]Do the run move!
[176:15.03]No!
[176:15.67]You didn't fu- He put his leg here and- I'm gonna swing at you with my left hand!
[176:19.44]No, I'm gonna hit you with my shield.
[176:24.26]If I didn't get one hundoed with that one swing.
[176:29.27]Stupid fuckface.
[176:30.41]See, that guy's dead.
[176:38.30]I'm gonna kill that guy.
[176:40.28]I demand to kill that guy.
[176:55.16]There's nothing worse than the enemies in these games that have the fucking 500 foot radius spear moves.
[177:03.08]You take all the enemies in this game, and every Dark Souls game, the ones I always hate the most are the ones with the fucking spears that they go like, and they have, it's like 12 arms length of distance they can cover.
[177:17.02]You know, I'm just gonna fucking parry him.
[177:29.27]Or not.
[177:31.04]I'm just gonna die.
[177:32.34]Oh my god, here comes a guy with a fucking giant pole.
[177:35.68]Can't wait.
[177:46.25]These... Fuck these enemies.
[177:48.73]These enemies are pieces of shit.
[177:54.33]These are the stupidest fucking enemies.
[177:58.74]I'm getting that guy.
[178:06.98]I don't care if it takes me all night.
[178:08.62]I'm going to kill that fucking blue asshole.
[178:13.22]First, let me get through the spear enemies.
[178:16.46]Oh, that's just like 5,000 fucking feet in front of a... Yeah, the spear... The spear... Oh.
[178:33.24]How is it?
[178:33.63]Is it good?
[178:33.97]Oh, God, it was worth it.
[178:40.11]That wasn't a backstab.
[178:40.91]Why the backstab's so odd?
[178:43.90]That was the worst backstab I have ever seen.
[178:46.44]And when I'm behind people, it doesn't do that.
[178:51.16]Can you give me a break?
[178:57.98]It's a lot quicker.
[178:58.76]Okay.
[179:03.07]Well...
[179:10.64]They have two different types of attacks that are just so annoying.
[179:16.54]And that was a back step.
[179:18.52]I guess.
[179:39.31]I don't fucking way.
[179:46.59]Who wants to get bombed?
[179:49.20]Is it you?
[179:50.30]Eat shit.
[179:52.06]Oh, I did nothing.
[180:05.06]Bad move, sucker.
[180:10.29]I don't... Why is that not a backstab?
[180:12.61]Why?
[180:13.12]God!
[180:16.90]Like, why do you have to be so dumb about it?
[180:18.56]I was right on his back!
[180:27.62]I'm just gonna die again.
[180:28.62]I'm fucking running.
[180:29.58]I'm done.
[180:30.75]I'm done with this stupid shit area.
[180:38.78]How can the backstabs work?
[180:40.18]Like 40% of the time if you're behind them.
[180:46.68]You guys can eat my fucking asshole.
[180:48.68]I'm out of here.
[180:51.66]Dumbest fucking enemy in this game.
[180:55.22]Zero stamina using fucking sword knight spear people.
[181:00.57]What am I doing?
[181:01.09]Oh, I'm raising the banner.
[181:15.56]Jesus, Jeremy, tone it back.
[181:16.84]It's hard to tone it back when you play games like this.
[181:19.13]Especially when, like, the goat brain guy comes and says hi.
[181:34.37]Oh.
[181:35.56]Didn't this happen in the first Dark Souls?
[181:41.90]I feel like this exact same thing happened already.
[181:51.22]Undead Settlement.
[181:52.40]Okay.
[182:00.07]I'm just going to start looking.
[182:03.63]Start snapping your photos.
[182:07.55]That's a nice view.
[182:12.82]Can you name your dog after me?
[182:14.70]Yeah, whatever.
[182:17.18]As long as he's a good boy.
[182:21.30]No bad dogs.
[182:22.04]Only good boys.
[182:22.82]Kind of a free item right there.
[182:30.14]I guess.
[182:33.63]Broken bridge.
[182:38.53]Large fall.
[182:42.09]Hmm.
[182:50.16]Try jumping.
[182:55.12]Could this be a gorgeous view?
[182:58.18]Why would you want to jump off this?
[183:04.68]Looks nice.
[183:05.20]Runs well, too.
[183:07.31]I'm just happy that the game actually, like, runs well.
[183:09.55]It's not, like, locked at, like, 30 FPS.
[183:10.71]What is going... Is it Brawl?
[183:28.08]This is a massacre actually.
[183:29.98]It's not a brawl.
[183:33.30]In the dog vs. ghoul fight, only dogs remain.
[183:40.04]Whatever.
[183:47.34]Hello, dog.
[183:53.42]Who are you?
[184:06.01]Nice talking.
[184:13.34]Rapier.
[184:16.86]Sterling.
[184:22.10]Thanks for the sub, Sterling.
[184:25.20]I'm going to open you in a minute.
[184:28.54]I'm going to go this way.
[184:38.69]More egg creatures.
[184:41.11]And hey, what are you snacking on over here, guys?
[184:43.99]What are you guys snacking on?
[184:46.02]What are you guys over here snacking on?
[184:48.14]See, that one's not dead.
[184:55.76]Luring skull.
[184:57.13]Sounds like a pretty good snack.
[185:03.93]This is creepy.
[185:11.12]Please, grant me death.
[185:14.62]Undo my shackles.
[185:18.58]Where's Waldo?
[185:20.00]Which one of them is talking?
[185:20.98]Alright, gotta find the one guy that's talking.
[185:34.83]Where is this guy?
[185:39.15]Which one of these is he?
[185:42.13]He's like, what?
[185:44.51]Oh, there he is.
[185:44.99]Found him.
[185:45.49]Found him.
[185:46.03]Found the one guy.
[185:48.02]I'm your dad.
[185:50.44]Destroy him!
[185:53.88]Whoa.
[185:54.64]Tank ninjas.
[185:56.66]Thanks for seven.
[185:59.28]Oh.
[186:01.42]Oh, then it's true.
[186:03.26]A champion of Ash as I live and breathe.
[186:07.52]To be in your presence is a great honor.
[186:11.77]I am Mjoll of Londor, a pilgrim as you can see, only somehow I failed to die as was ordained.
[186:21.95]Well, perhaps my calling lies elsewhere.
[186:26.13]Say, Champion of Ash, how does the idea of taking me into your service strike you?
[186:33.95]Oh, sorcerer, huh?
[186:37.59]I don't know.
[186:38.83]Should I trust the guy that looks like the firework snake after it's been lit?
[186:43.89]Yeah.
[186:44.03]He's going to be my buddy.
[186:47.84]Alright.
[186:48.38]He's now my best friend.
[187:05.07]Friendship.
[187:05.57]Yeah, he's my friend.
[187:07.59]Good thing he just ran away.
[187:12.25]Take me into your service, aka I'm going to teleport away.
[187:17.86]I think that's all I can do here, right?
[187:20.70]He's a pretty cool looking guy.
[187:22.14]Pretty cool enemy.
[187:25.12]Now that is a cool scene.
[187:28.10]Dragon crashed on the bridge, it looks like.
[187:29.79]Oh, wow.
[187:31.99]Very observant, Jerma.
[187:35.42]Maybe I can add that guy on Facebook.
[187:39.86]I can't wait to like all of his statuses.
[187:42.44]Oh, just found a new friend, new guy to be of service with.
[187:45.96]Oh, Jeremy likes this.
[187:48.88]It's gonna be his next post, just you watch.
[187:57.81]Okay, we've got a guy with a lantern.
[188:01.91]Before he rings the bell, get him!
[188:07.59]Cool.
[188:12.87]Why would I want to pull that again?
[188:13.79]There's a bonfire right here.
[188:19.69]Didn't I just get a bonfire?
[188:21.19]Right back there.
[188:23.21]I guess.
[188:32.17]Okie dokie.
[188:35.33]Nope.
[188:36.81]Forget about those guys.
[188:38.91]We've got places to go.
[188:39.92]We have lands to explore.
[188:44.44]Bosses to fight.
[188:47.40]People to... Hold on.
[188:50.81]Good thing I just pushed that guy.
[188:51.91]That guy couldn't handle my shoulder push.
[188:59.27]Look at him rolling into these guys.
[189:00.41]Shoves them.
[189:01.45]It's kind of interesting.
[189:12.95]Tell me I can't grab that.
[189:13.95]Oh, I'm definitely putting that on because that's going to be a parry shield, isn't it?
[189:29.52]Yay.
[189:31.74]Now parrying will be much easier.
[189:35.89]Isn't that swell?
[189:41.11]Anything else I can do out here?
[189:42.95]Before going into the depths.
[189:47.71]What Dark Souls enemy is the most dateable?
[189:51.82]Um... I don't know.
[189:57.28]Nothing out there... Okay.
[189:59.42]Let's go down the depths.
[190:04.77]Looks like a bagel.
[190:07.45]Kind of does.
[190:07.99]Except for the middle.
[190:20.71]Where's the safest place to drop?
[190:23.77]Do I need to drop?
[190:25.49]I might be able to just go around by walking?
[190:27.67]No.
[190:27.85]Okay.
[190:28.45]Stairs.
[190:29.09]Duh.
[190:32.47]Tree guy.
[190:33.86]You all knew the tree guy was probably going to stand up.
[190:39.12]Trevor the Magician.
[190:40.28]Court Jester.
[190:50.61]Hey, hey.
[190:51.93]Right in his gut.
[190:58.09]I got you right in the gut.
[191:02.20]Whoa.
[191:04.54]That is disturbing.
[191:15.45]That guy's on my head.
[191:16.23]Are you kidding me right now?
[191:20.60]Please stand up.
[191:21.66]Please stand up.
[191:33.65]I've died 15 times.
[191:34.81]Have I really?
[191:37.21]Embarrassing.
[191:43.87]How embarrassing.
[191:44.65]Hmm.
[191:55.91]Where did that guy come from?
[192:00.12]Odd.
[192:04.32]Very eerie, indeed.
[192:06.12]A lot of people died here.
[192:09.26]What does that mean?
[192:14.46]Try eliminating one at a time.
[192:17.15]Whoa, these go- Wow.
[192:20.15]What?
[192:22.07]There's like fucking 15 people here.
[192:26.72]What are you supposed to do?
[192:29.46]What do I do?
[192:30.94]What do I do?
[192:36.63]Who's the huge guy in the middle?
[192:40.31]Should I take the bow out?
[192:41.19]I feel like I need to put the bow on and just snipe somebody.
[192:45.49]Try to pull them.
[192:59.34]Are you serious?
[193:01.68]Alright, got him.
[193:05.35]I killed like the old maid.
[193:07.45]Who's next?
[193:09.47]Oh, you.
[193:13.69]Who did that?
[193:15.17]Oh, you bastard, you cut that right in my jugular.
[193:17.35]Alright, now get over here.
[193:23.52]He doesn't care anymore.
[193:26.32]You still see the arrow.
[193:30.05]Okay.
[193:35.27]I like these old grandmothers.
[193:37.14]Do these guys drive 1965 Cadillacs?
[193:42.44]No, you care.
[193:43.76]You're mad about that.
[193:53.42]Does that help me out here?
[193:58.88]I feel like maybe I can just do it one at a time.
[194:01.34]Although I might just pull the whole room right now.
[194:05.36]No, I guess I could just kind of walk up to them.
[194:16.24]Running through this area is going to suck.
[194:17.94]I'm realizing that.
[194:18.82]Every time I see this character, I laugh.
[194:22.35]And I got a new helmet too, didn't I?
[194:23.57]Let's take a look.
[194:29.46]Steel soldier helm.
[194:30.44]Equipment load.
[194:33.22]That's better.
[194:33.70]Am I still rolling okay?
[194:41.93]I think so.
[194:42.37]I look like a fucking bootleg Darth Vader.
[195:05.71]Where's my lightsaber?
[195:16.34]Oh, a new hat.
[195:18.72]Looks like a mid-roll.
[195:19.66]Yeah, it does.
[195:21.84]Now that I think about it.
[195:25.59]I'll put the witch's hat on.
[195:36.51]Feels the same.
[195:37.11]Just out of curiosity.
[195:54.52]Maybe it is a little less distance.
[196:04.36]That is extremely easy to dodge.
[196:08.59]Okay, I say that now and they are not going away.
[196:14.81]Did they just not disappear ever?
[196:20.57]You stupid fucking scarecrow.
[196:24.06]Back to Batman.
[196:41.05]Is this Ursula from Little Mermaid?
[196:43.09]Is she going to start singing?
[196:46.77]What the fuck happened there?
[196:55.07]I was going to do an Ursula.
[197:00.59]Oh, Estus Shard.
[197:01.87]Fantastic.
[197:09.18]Soul of an Unknown Traveler.
[197:10.40]I'm going to put my armor back on.
[197:12.00]I think I'm still fine.
[197:26.54]Alright, let's take it slow and fine.
[197:31.02]Going back to Darth Vader.
[197:32.36]I didn't go this way, did I?
[197:38.41]Did I go this way?
[197:39.97]I came from this way, right?
[197:43.48]Shit.
[197:48.08]I thought fat rolling you actually landed on your back.
[197:51.46]I feel like I'm not.
[197:52.22]I don't know.
[197:54.40]I can't really determine if it's that big of a deal.
[198:07.14]Where the hell is this person going?
[198:16.71]Fine, I'll heal.
[198:18.73]Fine, I'll heal.
[198:26.22]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[198:31.86]Stew Eddie.
[198:32.70]Stewie Eddie.
[198:34.78]Thanks for the resub, dude.
[198:35.50]Welcome back.
[198:42.61]I would be using the skill more often, but I feel like it takes too long and it puts you in a weird position.
[198:47.43]What do I do to this guy?
[198:48.23]Are you ready?
[198:49.87]Here we go.
[198:50.26]Like, oh, here it comes!
[198:51.14]Fuck.
[198:57.20]I don't know, I just... I feel like I could have killed that guy way faster if I didn't do that move.
[199:04.19]I just have to hit the guy like two or three times, not like nine, like that move does.
[199:12.20]Yeah, that's way more efficient than doing that move.
[199:16.60]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[199:21.71]Potato!
[199:22.33]Potato 3.
[199:22.83]Thanks for the reset, dude.
[199:24.75]Welcome back.
[199:26.93]Welcome back, red wizard.
[199:29.25]I'm kind of scared to open this door.
[199:39.48]Now, correct me if I'm wrong, somebody.
[199:43.60]Did they get rid of the crunch berries?
[199:51.46]I don't know.
[199:58.50]Those things are enemies?
[200:00.44]Those things are enemies.
[200:06.43]You fuckers.
[200:10.87]I don't even know if I want to go in there.
[200:12.01]I think I have to.
[200:13.37]He's going to be spitting shit at me.
[200:19.95]How many of these guys are... No, that's the only one in here.
[200:22.09]That was a troll.
[200:22.87]I got trolled.
[200:31.18]I forgot I was playing Dark Souls for a minute.
[200:39.89]Oh, son of a bitch.
[200:40.91]This is going to happen again.
[200:42.37]I can tell.
[200:42.83]See?
[200:43.39]They think they can fool me?
[200:44.80]You're going to fool me?
[200:45.50]You're going to fool me?
[200:46.70]Look it.
[200:47.96]This one's a little bit more brown and beige.
[200:50.94]These ones are all gray.
[200:53.62]Yeah.
[200:54.04]Oh, I wonder which one's the enemy.
[200:57.06]This one.
[200:57.50]Guy's slowly walking at me right now.
[201:05.58]That is terrifying.
[201:10.18]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[201:17.07]Hey, Murray's Bagels.
[201:19.01]Mr. Murray.
[201:21.51]Shit.
[201:23.67]I went for a Hail Mary there and I got it.
[201:25.36]Going for another Hail Mary.
[201:26.68]Got it.
[201:29.62]There's two Hail Marys in a row.
[201:37.08]Shit.
[201:38.66]Just two of them.
[201:43.25]Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.
[201:47.67]God.
[201:48.59]Take them outside.
[201:49.49]Let's take this outside, guys.
[201:52.00]I thought those were all enemies.
[201:53.32]They all just did the thing in Dark Souls and Bloodborne where... Hold on.
[201:57.56]Can't talk.
[202:05.76]The game, like, froze.
[202:10.50]The game locked up on me.
[202:19.57]Rate Taco Bell on a scale from 1 to moon?
[202:23.71]I don't know.
[202:28.27]Taco Bell's alright.
[202:29.81]But you always kind of feel terrible after eating it.
[202:45.07]I actually haven't eaten Taco Bell in a long time.
[202:46.55]It has been a good at least 6 to 12 months since I've eaten Taco Bell.
[203:00.30]I really should go back to town and upgrade my Estus Flask.
[203:05.95]Because I do have a Chardonnay.
[203:08.21]I do have some Chardonnay.
[203:10.77]Okay.
[203:13.00]Oh, the French Chardonnay has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[203:16.01]Where's the other guy?
[203:24.09]There's two guys up here, I think.
[203:33.06]Corporal Small.
[203:35.32]Thanks for subbing, man.
[203:35.88]You're welcome.
[203:44.52]Loretta's Bone.
[203:47.94]Don't know what the hell that does.
[203:48.90]I wonder if I can just not aggro any of this and just go buy it.
[203:54.55]What is Loretta's Bone?
[203:56.33]Is it a weapon?
[203:57.93]No.
[204:02.03]Loretta's Bone.
[204:02.89]Old human bone with several holes bored into it.
[204:08.13]Huh?
[204:10.74]What does it even do?
[204:16.68]Another spot that I haven't really explored.
[204:21.70]Look at all these exploration areas.
[204:26.59]Shit.
[204:29.95]Now that swing gets me every time.
[204:31.81]The overhead is just hard to judge when they're going to do it.
[204:34.67]Did I just get hit?
[204:42.08]I think it might be time to throw the rapier in the trash, by the way.
[204:51.01]It's like... What did you... She hugged me to death.
[204:56.93]She loved me too much.
[204:57.95]I didn't know she was there.
[205:08.33]Get this fucking thing off.
[205:13.69]Can't be back to, like, being able to actually hit enemies.
[205:15.85]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[205:21.21]Cake SEA for two months.
[205:22.84]What's going on, man?
[205:25.66]There it is again.
[205:26.80]Fucking me.
[205:29.36]That wasn't a... Okay.
[205:30.02]I'm gonna have to take your word for it.
[205:31.96]I thought I got it.
[205:43.59]Why am I emailed to the solar system?
[205:45.53]Why not?
[205:48.43]Why not?
[205:54.31]Oh, my back.
[205:55.05]I gotta, like, stretch my back out.
[205:58.88]C is a word.
[205:59.66]It's just, when it's all lowercase, sometimes it can screw up my brain.
[206:05.50]S-E-A horse.
[206:07.58]A seahorse.
[206:11.58]It's much easier to hit these guys now.
[206:15.16]Sean Michael.
[206:19.94]Sean Michael.
[206:20.84]Welcome back.
[206:23.78]It actually feels good to be able to hit enemies.
[206:25.44]I'm beginning to get hit.
[206:30.82]I thought that guy was dead behind me for a second.
[206:42.63]Oh, but the dreaded backflip is back.
[206:52.55]The accidental cartwheel is back, though.
[206:54.82]Unfortunately.
[206:55.42]Alright, we're going straight away.
[207:06.44]Give me those souls.
[207:10.22]Goodbye.
[207:12.86]Did I not pull the whole room?
[207:13.82]Good.
[207:14.10]I didn't.
[207:16.14]Shit.
[207:16.36]I thought I had the shield out.
[207:20.84]Okay.
[207:21.18]Well, that... Bye!
[207:22.34]Bye.
[207:24.20]See ya.
[207:28.32]Ugh.
[207:31.66]I'm gonna go get my Estus Flask.
[207:35.46]And then I'm going to take it slow.
[207:37.26]I'm kind of just trying to rush through here.
[207:38.52]I'm just gonna die.
[207:40.42]I'm going to give the Estus Flask, come back down, and take my time.
[207:43.84]Because last time I took my time with Zeria, I did fine.
[207:46.70]I'm just trying to, like, sprint through it for some dumb reason.
[208:00.71]Give me my extra flask.
[208:12.38]Because unfortunately with this area, there are a huge amount of enemies in that spot.
[208:18.10]You can't fuck around.
[208:19.10]It also might be time to just bite the bullet here and get this leveled up once.
[208:35.61]I think that's what's going to have to happen.
[208:38.91]Maybe.
[208:47.23]Do I have any... I do.
[208:49.11]I'm not going to use those right now.
[208:52.27]I could use this too.
[208:53.07]I hope there's some dope dex weapons in the game.
[209:10.76]There probably are a lot of weapons to choose from.
[209:12.60]I would assume.
[209:18.65]Alright, let's take it slow.
[209:20.44]Don't try to rush anything.
[209:22.16]There's a ton of enemies here.
[209:24.40]Take them on one by one.
[209:28.23]Find the next step.
[209:45.75]Katanas.
[209:46.19]Yeah, there probably are a couple of katanas in the game.
[209:47.77]I would assume.
[209:52.25]The Bloodborne katana was awesome.
[209:57.33]Okay, easy.
[209:59.83]Is there anything over there that I can jump to?
[210:03.31]Doesn't look like it.
[210:07.65]Where is he?
[210:11.05]Show yourself.
[210:12.09]Where are you, little jester?
[210:16.85]Why do I feel like he just kind of jumped on me when I... No.
[210:22.72]Just wait for this dude.
[210:30.34]Be wary of enemy.
[210:31.18]Yeah, I know.
[210:33.90]Be wary of item.
[210:40.84]Rubbish!
[210:55.15]Ember.
[210:55.61]Gain strength of flame.
[210:56.87]Boosting HP till death?
[211:00.03]Well, that's new.
[211:00.71]I mean, let's see what it does.
[211:08.25]What does it do?
[211:13.13]Damn.
[211:13.33]Huh.
[211:13.41]Interesting.
[211:19.44]Interesting.
[211:21.24]Interesting.
[211:31.27]Trevor Belmont Wow you almost got me look at a phantom couch philanthropist Welcome to the family Thanks for subscribing Come on through the stairs really
[211:57.15]Thankfully, he didn't hurt me that much.
[212:08.66]Welcome to my family.
[212:18.77]Is it me or when I backstab somebody and they lie on the ground and they're dying...
[212:23.76]It makes a sword stab through their chest sound.
[212:27.56]Like, shoo!
[212:30.60]It happens way after the fact, though.
[212:34.12]Like, after I pull it out.
[212:34.96]Okay, let's be easy here.
[212:41.65]I don't think I have to do this.
[212:43.23]I think I can just get by it.
[212:46.25]As long as I don't, like, stumble into a bunch of people.
[212:49.95]Should be able to kind of wrap around this way.
[212:53.62]Looks like I can.
[212:54.44]Let's just see what's down here.
[212:57.09]I'm gonna go in like the old mineshaft.
[213:11.09]Who is... Okay.
[213:16.04]I really would love to kill these guys in two swings.
[213:21.44]That's why I'm thinking of just leveling up my...
[213:26.07]dual blades here.
[213:26.95]I'll put these on.
[213:36.98]Why not?
[213:38.44]Show off my arms.
[213:39.32]Show off my really skinny arms.
[213:40.86]What do we press on?
[213:55.54]Got ya.
[213:56.56]Anybody coming behind me?
[213:58.18]No.
[213:59.93]That's where I died.
[214:00.75]Alright.
[214:13.09]Back to bed.
[214:17.31]Drop it down.
[214:20.41]This is where I ended up before.
[214:23.85]With the weird Tusken Raider guy.
[214:30.25]What is going on with that?
[214:31.45]Why couldn't I... What the fuck is going on with this?
[214:35.68]11 damage?
[214:38.92]What is happening right now?
[214:43.70]The confusion is setting in.
[214:54.95]Fusion is setting in, guys.
[214:58.14]I killed this guy in like two hits before, but that was with the rapier, I guess.
[215:06.28]I would love it if these things got the fuck out of the way.
[215:08.00]Okay.
[215:21.75]I'm gonna just do a jumping- Ow!
[215:24.09]Ow!
[215:24.55]Ow!
[215:29.70]You're on such a bad place for me to hit you right now.
[215:39.08]Okay, maybe I should just put on the rapier, like, in my second hand.
[215:45.97]Just in case that happens again.
[215:51.74]still rolling fine yeah okay this door is locked oh it doesn't open I haven't really been looking for illusory illusionary walls pretty much praise the sun indeed
[216:28.12]Lots of good souls from these guys.
[216:31.58]Oh, you guys.
[216:32.52]A lot of summoning signs.
[216:38.79]Does that mean I'm about to fight a baddie?
[216:47.33]Could go that way, but let's just look.
[216:50.37]Down the hall over here.
[216:52.23]Oh, lots of bad guys.
[216:53.52]Alright, door number one or door number two?
[216:57.52]I think I'm gonna try door number two.
[217:02.02]Big soul, that's alright.
[217:04.78]I hear noises.
[217:09.60]Okay.
[217:10.22]Well, whatever.
[217:13.17]They keep throwing this, like, Simon Belmont guy into my face.
[217:15.87]Why?
[217:16.07]Why?
[217:20.09]Travis Belmont.
[217:31.96]This room seems to serve no purpose.
[217:35.58]At least on the outside, looking in.
[217:42.62]Every time I see it, he laughs.
[217:46.75]He's got a pretty funny face.
[217:57.31]Okay, that's really gonna come.
[217:59.41]Found the purpose of the room.
[218:01.99]Figured out the room's purpose, guys.
[218:04.43]Just to hide from the homing projectiles.
[218:13.34]Official Discord server?
[218:14.58]Sounds fun.
[218:15.76]I might do something like that.
[218:17.20]That sounds interesting.
[218:20.28]Dude breaking out of walls.
[218:23.99]I was going to say, where was he?
[218:25.15]That was a delayed reaction.
[218:26.17]He broke the wall to scare me and then didn't come out.
[218:33.32]Why is that wall a different color?
[218:34.38]I'm so scared.
[218:39.86]He's like right here.
[218:40.44]Come on.
[218:41.61]Get in here.
[218:51.79]I suggested that months ago.
[218:54.66]Yeah, but I don't know.
[218:57.02]It's hard to manage a million things like that.
[218:58.83]I mean, it's like Discord server.
[219:01.61]You gotta like, you gotta manage it.
[219:03.23]There's all the upkeep.
[219:05.85]I'm kidding.
[219:07.57]Where's the two-hander, dude?
[219:09.61]I wanna pull the guy with the sledgehammer up here.
[219:14.34]A whip!
[219:19.46]I got a whip.
[219:22.40]Should I try the whip?
[219:24.10]No, not right now.
[219:25.71]That's a mistake.
[219:26.31]I'm probably close to a shortcut or a skip or something up here.
[219:33.63]I want to shoot her with the bow, I think.
[219:36.73]She's really annoying.
[219:37.77]How many bolts do I have?
[219:43.31]Five?
[219:43.65]I don't think that's enough.
[220:01.50]48 damage.
[220:02.04]It's like nothing.
[220:02.72]It's kind of awkward to shoot this.
[220:13.57]Yeah, we're going back to... Going back to the basics.
[220:21.36]Alright, follow me.
[220:25.28]Follow me.
[220:27.72]Will you please follow me?
[220:29.44]You really don't want to follow me, do you?
[220:36.71]What does that thing mean?
[220:41.52]What an annoying enemy placement.
[220:44.40]Please get up here.
[220:50.30]Come on.
[220:57.85]That bleed?
[220:58.43]Oh, trousers.
[220:59.65]No.
[221:08.87]Yeah, I don't have like a Discord at the moment.
[221:10.81]At least like an official one or something.
[221:20.32]What is going on?
[221:21.26]I hear a bunch of exploding noises.
[221:22.68]Is that just her shooting those at me?
[221:31.86]How annoying.
[221:36.82]Nothing up here.
[221:38.04]Come on.
[221:38.50]Don't do this to me.
[221:47.95]Place to go over here.
[221:50.73]Item.
[221:52.19]A Titanite shard.
[221:52.89]Bonfire.
[221:53.17]Bonfire.
[221:54.73]Bonfire.
[221:57.64]All I gotta do is make it to the bonfire.
[222:00.62]And we'll be all set.
[222:10.49]Where was that bonfire?
[222:12.45]Right here?
[222:16.13]Where the fuck was that bonfire?
[222:17.47]I feel like it was like right there.
[222:21.61]I see a jewel bug.
[222:23.58]There it is.
[222:28.59]She has no item.
[222:33.09]Okay, I gotta get rid of this jewel bug.
[222:36.80]Jewel bug or bonfire?
[222:39.12]Jewel bug or bonfire?
[222:42.14]Jewel bug.
[222:50.16]What?
[222:51.10]I'm being invaded!
[222:51.62]I'm being invaded, go!
[222:59.05]Who's invading me?
[223:08.02]Okay, let's go back and level up.
[223:22.45]That was terrifying.
[223:26.11]Alrighty.
[223:29.33]I think... I mean, I... I'm going to upgrade this once.
[223:34.29]At least one time.
[223:35.89]Well, he could be a whip guy.
[223:41.01]No.
[223:43.33]Rapier... 104, 24, 108.
[223:47.15]I don't like the rapier, though.
[223:52.47]It's really... I need two Titanite shards.
[223:57.78]I have six.
[224:05.91]I'm just gonna do it.
[224:07.23]What's the harm in doing it once?
[224:09.09]Tighten that charge usually you can buy later on anyways, I think, right?
[224:16.15]I'll do it once.
[224:16.61]I mean, I'm not a huge fan of this weapon, but it gets the job done when it needs to.
[224:36.15]That's enough for you.
[224:37.07]I'm gonna put some points in strength.
[224:43.05]Maybe two.
[224:43.79]Get it to twelve maybe.
[224:46.07]Some weapons you can't even put them on without like a lot of strength.
[224:50.77]I'll try the whip.
[224:51.30]Let's just take a look and see how fun it is.
[224:52.74]Because the whip is like one of the weirdest items in Dark Souls.
[225:02.50]Too slow.
[225:03.94]Too slow!
[225:06.94]That was kind of cool, though.
[225:14.19]Seems like it has a pretty big arc on it.
[225:20.93]It's just too much, though.
[225:22.09]Way too slow.
[225:22.81]Maybe I'll dual-weld whips.
[225:34.01]It's too springy and a little too slow, I think.
[225:36.61]For my tastes.
[225:37.99]Might be fun to try at some point, though.
[225:41.45]Where are my twin blades?
[225:55.54]Alright, let's do some of the... I have a lot of souls.
[226:00.02]Used to require a smidgen.
[226:02.42]I would love a smidgen.
[226:08.36]Doing a whip build would actually be pretty fun, but... I just don't know.
[226:14.00]Not the first time I'm playing a game.
[226:14.90]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[226:17.88]Hey!
[226:18.60]Otty!
[226:19.72]Otto!
[226:20.68]Thanks for the resub, Otty.
[226:21.46]Now can I use more than one Ember to get my health extremely high?
[226:31.25]I have two of these.
[226:38.74]Alright, I got a lot of points to work with now.
[226:43.03]I'm gonna go... Two points in strength.
[226:55.01]And... That's all I can do.
[226:56.67]One point... Eh, two points in strength.
[227:02.31]Farewell, Ashen One.
[227:05.12]Got a little bit more right-hand damage, too.
[227:06.48]Because I know somewhere down the road, I'm going to find a weapon I really like, and it's going to be, you need like 22 strength to put it on, and I'm going to facepalm.
[227:16.97]But there'd be bonfire.
[227:17.71]Alright, let's try it.
[227:19.23]Go to the new bonfire and keep progressing through this video game.
[227:29.88]Dark drift.
[227:34.86]There's a gate behind me.
[227:40.90]I'll take this one.
[227:42.49]Get the one behind me.
[227:45.31]Star Fox.
[227:45.71]Star Fox 64.
[227:46.07]Maybe I can kill the... I can't get up there again.
[227:51.21]Shit.
[227:52.03]I think I missed out on that bug for now.
[227:56.23]Oh, here's the Mad King.
[227:57.89]I'm being invaded by the Mad Knight.
[228:01.57]There he is.
[228:02.73]That smug asshole.
[228:05.31]Coming down here.
[228:05.75]I think he runs the whole show.
[228:10.33]He's just going to walk at me.
[228:12.49]There he comes.
[228:16.47]Shit.
[228:19.01]God damn it.
[228:19.49]Really?
[228:20.27]You swing too slow, man.
[228:27.44]You have a lot of health.
[228:28.62]I'm going to have to do that like four times.
[228:34.79]He's doing that weird move.
[228:38.88]Oh, I didn't have any... What the fuck?
[228:47.24]What was I, like, locked over there for?
[228:55.10]I have so much trouble with people that swing.
[228:57.63]Swing, like, 100 miles per hour and I'll parry you every time.
[229:00.95]It was the guys that do like the slow, arcing, gigantic fucking swings.
[229:07.31]I just can't parry them to save my life.
[229:09.63]Hey, Rule, R. Lehmann.
[229:12.01]Lehmann, 8.
[229:14.13]Just subscribed.
[229:16.75]Now watch, I'm not even going to try to parry this guy and I'm going to fucking destroy him.
[229:21.11]That's the sad part of this whole thing.
[229:22.51]Oh, and they're going to invade me.
[229:27.75]With your like four second swings.
[229:37.85]Now he doesn't want to show his face.
[229:48.89]Apparently he doesn't want to show up again.
[229:51.03]Look at how the giant accordion does though.
[229:59.79]You swing a lot.
[230:01.35]You swing a ton of times.
[230:07.48]Slow down there.
[230:08.24]I don't know when to go in.
[230:26.23]This guy's a madman.
[230:35.14]All you had was rubbish.
[230:43.37]Could go for the bug again.
[230:44.57]You know what?
[230:45.05]I'm gonna get the bug.
[230:48.11]Might as well not forget about it.
[230:49.59]I can just reload the area right here.
[230:51.46]That guy wasn't that much of a pain in the ass.
[230:52.68]And I can just wrap around and run to the bug.
[230:56.10]Come here, bug!
[231:04.12]Maybe I'll get invaded.
[231:07.12]By Holy Knight the Slow.
[231:15.57]Am I crazy?
[231:18.49]Or wasn't there a bug right here?
[231:20.55]Maybe I have to reload the whole area?
[231:26.84]Whatever.
[231:33.64]Huh.
[231:40.98]Secret wall.
[231:41.38]Come on.
[231:47.42]Just gonna take a peek up here.
[231:50.38]Just a peek.
[231:52.08]Yeah, it's just that area again.
[232:00.94]Whatever.
[232:02.16]Let's move on.
[232:04.88]What's the purpose of this?
[232:07.57]Hey, Reese-ery!
[232:17.18]Reekery or Reesery.
[232:19.88]Welcome.
[232:20.14]Thanks for subbing.
[232:21.10]Much appreciated.
[232:23.20]Enjoy your emotes.
[232:24.76]And enjoy your time as a shock jogger.
[232:36.98]Meow.
[232:41.16]That's a lot of arc on it.
[232:42.56]Like that.
[232:42.98]I'm trying to interrupt him.
[232:59.62]Didn't really go so well.
[233:04.62]I'm going to call that guy the exercise guy.
[233:06.56]He just does reps.
[233:09.40]He does like 10 reps.
[233:16.72]Could this be a shortcut?
[233:18.39]Oh, could it be?
[233:26.95]Somebody died.
[233:30.21]Where is this taking me?
[233:35.90]This is an odd... I feel like there should be an item right here.
[233:39.44]Right?
[233:42.02]Right?
[233:49.69]Huh.
[233:50.39]Okay, well.
[233:51.97]What purpose does that serve?
[233:55.72]I feel like I've said that quite a few times.
[233:57.12]But no, like, really, though.
[233:59.02]This looks like something should be happening over here.
[234:01.10]At least an item.
[234:03.38]Did I already get this?
[234:04.68]Maybe I did.
[234:06.48]I'm gonna leave a note that just says, uh, pity, it was for nothing.
[234:15.31]Ooh.
[234:17.35]Shiny thing.
[234:18.01]How do I get up there?
[234:23.70]There's a lot of stuff.
[234:26.42]Anytime I see a ton of those, then somebody is... Wow!
[234:31.60]Who?
[234:33.72]Who's doing this?
[234:36.44]They're just... Okay, somebody in the tower is doing that.
[234:40.44]Oh, God.
[234:41.70]God, where did all these people come from?
[234:48.04]Oh.
[234:51.32]Oh.
[234:53.24]Quickly, quickly get them.
[235:01.76]See ya.
[235:03.04]He even tried to shoot down at me when I fell.
[235:18.60]I'm just gonna run past this guy and just have him get shot.
[235:25.64]Yeah, come over and attack me where the artillery is.
[235:28.08]We'll just get killed.
[235:31.94]I could probably wrap around and get up there eventually.
[235:42.70]Is the accordion exercise guy following me?
[235:46.90]Even dodging around, I could have to like watch.
[235:51.84]Come on, really?
[235:53.32]Really, you're that accurate with this shit?
[235:59.17]At least it's killing them.
[236:01.61]Shoot them.
[236:02.93]Come on.
[236:04.55]How could you be that accurate?
[236:06.49]No one is that accurate.
[236:09.28]That's my chance.
[236:09.88]That's my chance.
[236:17.18]Reinforce club.
[236:18.20]That might be a keeper.
[236:20.90]That might be a keeper.
[236:21.76]Get the rest.
[236:22.14]Come on.
[236:26.36]Where's the other one?
[236:31.33]Damn.
[236:32.25]Even if I die, I don't even care.
[236:33.23]I'm going to get the items.
[236:34.65]Those are the things that matter.
[236:38.17]Jumping doesn't matter.
[236:40.39]Run.
[236:44.89]Raff around.
[236:46.43]Raff around.
[236:50.19]Oh, God.
[236:50.73]I just got like a... I can't even... I'm still alive.
[236:57.28]I'm still alive.
[236:57.90]I'm still alive.
[237:05.30]I have to get that item.
[237:06.46]I have to get it.
[237:11.56]I got an entire set of armor.
[237:15.66]What did I pick?
[237:16.28]Oh.
[237:18.86]The cleric hat.
[237:21.20]Magic fire lighting dark.
[237:26.36]It doesn't really protect me from very much.
[237:30.28]Although it's pretty good elemental resistance gear.
[237:36.75]I slid down.
[237:38.41]My character was unconscious right there.
[237:40.81]He just, like, slowly drifted down.
[237:43.65]That was great.
[237:45.17]I don't even care about dying here.
[237:46.29]This is, like, funny.
[237:47.23]This is fun.
[237:47.81]Okay, this is what I wanted to see.
[237:51.14]Goddamn.
[237:51.84]Strength.
[237:54.10]Strength only scaling.
[237:58.10]Looks like we're still in with the twin blades.
[238:00.42]What else is new?
[238:05.95]I kinda gotta pee.
[238:08.03]Does anybody else have to pee?
[238:17.97]Dude, you totally missed.
[238:19.01]Alright, here we go.
[238:29.02]We're just gonna try the run.
[238:31.30]The run technique doesn't work.
[238:37.99]Come on, rain hell on these guys.
[238:45.48]There's one more item down here.
[238:49.72]Sorry, do the slide again.
[238:50.78]Just get this.
[238:52.34]Mortician Ashes.
[238:57.39]Can you please shoot the guys in front of the tree, please?
[239:03.17]There's another item down here.
[239:04.41]Around to the right.
[239:07.37]I'm going to get it.
[239:07.93]There it is.
[239:12.43]How do I get this?
[239:16.73]Those guys got killed.
[239:18.01]Nice.
[239:21.41]Wow.
[239:22.59]Raining on me.
[239:23.87]Undead bone shard.
[239:24.75]I don't know what that does.
[239:28.47]At least I got the item.
[239:34.49]Undead bone shard.
[239:35.24]Is that to make my Estus Flask better?
[239:40.12]Might be worth looking at that.
[239:44.98]Undead bone shard.
[239:45.48]Burn the shrine buffer to increase Estus recovery.
[239:47.84]Oh, yeah.
[239:54.45]Huh?
[239:56.59]Can I... Do I have to burn it at, like, the super fire?
[240:02.68]Burn and Shrine Bonfire.
[240:04.06]I'm not going to do that.
[240:04.82]Let's go do it right now.
[240:06.76]So I'm going to take this opportunity.
[240:07.74]I'm going to do this and then I'm going to go pee.
[240:11.26]You know what I'm saying?
[240:16.86]So I'm going to put on my starting soon screen.
[240:21.69]And you can go pee.
[240:22.97]Alright.
[240:30.72]I shall return.
[240:31.48]I'll be right back.
[240:33.25]Take this opportunity to use the restroom.
[240:36.49]I can't even press the button to make it.
[240:40.49]To make the screen change.
[240:42.90]But I'll be right back.
[240:45.08]Take a quick little break.
[240:45.88]I shall return.
[240:46.72]See ya.
[240:47.22]See ya.
[240:51.04]I'll be back.
[242:58.33]I'm back.
[243:00.03]And I brought snacks.
[243:04.85]I gotta eat as fast as I can.
[243:09.89]Okay.
[243:19.70]The only beer that matters.
[243:26.28]I think I got all the items here.
[243:31.48]You and Sebax run an official Discord if you wanted to make it the official one.
[243:37.10]Um... I don't know.
[243:40.23]I'm not rolling anymore when I fall.
[243:45.47]Because I'm not sure if, uh... Because if it's, like, my, like, sub-Discord, I would hate to have to, like, defer that to other people to have to, like, deal with.
[243:59.70]Like, putting burden on other people to worry about my Discord, my official Discord.
[244:05.55]Uh, for now, just use it for today and, you know, for the next, like, couple weeks, maybe.
[244:10.37]And I'll see if it's what I want to do.
[244:13.13]Appreciate the offer, though.
[244:15.85]Appreciate the offer, mate.
[244:17.74]Can't go in that room.
[244:23.50]They really make it so you can't go in there.
[244:27.05]The accordion guy followed me.
[244:29.54]Did he actually follow me this time?
[244:33.70]They're all dying.
[244:34.28]It was just Luthez pressed that guy.
[244:38.54]That guy always got stone-colded.
[244:47.93]Boy.
[244:49.01]Well, I am safe for a moment.
[244:59.74]Time for skill.
[245:02.36]Ooh, a scythe.
[245:05.60]I kinda like the... I kinda like scythes.
[245:09.40]Please be a dex weapon.
[245:10.32]Be a dex weapon.
[245:11.04]Be a dex weapon.
[245:13.60]It's a dex weapon.
[245:17.33]I need 14 strength to use it.
[245:22.65]It's got bleed?
[245:23.27]Is that bleed?
[245:25.87]Told you I should put points in the strength.
[245:28.07]Now I kind of feel like a dummy putting any shards into this.
[245:32.99]Shit.
[245:34.47]Whatever.
[245:35.63]You win some, you lose some.
[245:41.63]Stop shooting, but I don't think it's going to last very long.
[245:45.72]Shooting, shooting.
[245:46.60]Is it going to shoot me?
[245:48.06]Not going to shoot me.
[245:48.72]Okay.
[245:50.96]Oh, secret!
[245:51.56]Secret!
[245:52.40]Come on!
[245:53.62]Touch it!
[245:57.77]Did this guy lie to me?
[245:58.65]Oh, I can't believe it.
[246:03.63]I got lied to.
[246:06.07]What a bad guy that guy is.
[246:08.05]What about this one?
[246:10.49]No.
[246:15.43]The area seems to have changed a little bit.
[246:19.69]There's a boss.
[246:22.16]That is a boss area, but could this be some kind of shortcut?
[246:33.23]Um.
[246:37.79]Maybe?
[246:38.07]That's the front door to here.
[246:40.62]That's where it came from, right?
[246:47.78]I don't remember this.
[246:49.03]I don't remember there being an Ursula right here.
[247:01.37]She's actually speaking English.
[247:03.62]I thought they just made weird undead noises.
[247:16.88]Don't you do it.
[247:24.89]Ooh.
[247:34.51]You can't be staggered very much when you hit her.
[247:36.16]Are the dogs here, Dom?
[247:42.48]Who let the dogs out?
[247:49.78]Return the slab.
[247:51.03]Return the slab.
[247:57.63]What is that from Courage, the Cowardly Dog?
[248:00.51]Return the slab.
[248:03.74]Turn the slab.
[248:06.76]So this looks like... I just want to, from memory, I want to make sure I know where I'm going here.
[248:10.13]When I come back, if I die a million times to the boss, which is probably what's going to happen.
[248:14.63]Is... Oh no, we got a new enemy.
[248:17.91]Clay pot guy.
[248:18.81]I haven't gone this way.
[248:25.13]Is he gonna, like, dump hot oil on me?
[248:34.89]I feel like there's a skip back here that I need to get.
[248:36.95]You know what I mean?
[248:48.40]There's going to be a door to open.
[248:49.92]A locked entrance.
[248:57.69]Holy shit.
[248:58.31]Who is doing this to me?
[248:59.19]What are you throwing at me?
[248:59.99]What's burning me?
[249:03.19]Where are you?
[249:04.57]You guys up there, seriously?
[249:12.86]Got it.
[249:16.06]Got it!
[249:24.50]Bonfire ahead.
[249:26.98]Really.
[249:32.88]Round shield.
[249:33.54]I can't open that door.
[249:37.67]Shit.
[249:43.01]That's like a skip, but how... Can I just go around it?
[249:46.55]I might be able to go in... Can I go in like a door here?
[249:49.61]Or did I miss out on that?
[249:52.00]I feel like I might have missed out on it.
[249:55.88]Well, we can go over here.
[249:59.74]Thought that was an enemy.
[250:01.48]It is an enemy, isn't it?
[250:02.20]Yeah, it is.
[250:12.50]You guys are doing... Wait, you guys are doing positive and negative without me?
[250:16.72]Did you know you gotta have... I gotta be there for every positive and negative.
[250:19.79]It's important.
[250:27.11]Damn it.
[250:29.65]Oh, screw you.
[250:34.66]Ah!
[250:37.50]Not happy about that.
[250:42.84]Not happy about that at all.
[250:44.22]I'm going to have to find a way to open that.
[250:58.25]Can I break this?
[251:04.01]Back this way, I guess.
[251:08.10]Damn it.
[251:11.46]I'm going to try going around this way.
[251:12.96]It might be good.
[251:16.72]There really is a bonfire up there.
[251:18.01]I kind of desperately want to get it.
[251:35.49]Alright, they're dying in two.
[251:36.29]I didn't think he was gonna jump out that fast.
[251:45.11]I thought that was one of those magician jester people.
[251:57.44]We're in a swamp now.
[252:01.42]Ladies and gentlemen, we have found the rats.
[252:17.71]Oh, the punch gloves.
[252:20.97]That's nice.
[252:24.45]It's locked.
[252:25.53]Shortcut ahead.
[252:26.19]I'm just curious.
[252:28.85]I think these are... No, these aren't decks.
[252:32.80]Hmm.
[252:33.98]Wow.
[252:38.84]Giant rat.
[252:40.06]Giant fucking rat.
[252:50.16]Shortcut ahead, aka fight a giant rat.
[252:55.08]I hope there's still a shortcut ahead.
[252:56.52]Otherwise, I'm going to be severely disappointed.
[253:03.50]Although, he did drop a ring.
[253:04.66]Increases bleed resistance.
[253:08.86]I will put it on.
[253:11.54]And increases fire attack, but compromises damage absorption.
[253:15.41]I don't know if I want that right now.
[253:22.21]What's going on, Jackson?
[253:23.65]The real Jackson.
[253:24.91]Thanks for the sub.
[253:28.88]Thank you so much.
[253:30.52]You are very much appreciated.
[253:32.42]This looks like the thing to open for a shortcut.
[253:37.28]A shortcut.
[253:38.50]Shortcut.
[253:44.03]Uh... Okay.
[253:47.19]Where does this lead to?
[253:50.67]I don't know.
[253:53.01]I don't have any idea.
[253:57.95]Ooh, it's the bonfire.
[254:00.19]We did it.
[254:01.28]We made it to the bonfire.
[254:08.76]Tatsuwa... Tatsuwa Nugin.
[254:12.18]Thank you so much.
[254:16.06]Thank you so much.
[254:26.71]Level up again.
[254:27.35]I want strength.
[254:29.88]Again.
[254:30.24]Get that to 14 and I want to see how cool this scythe is.
[254:43.68]Could be cool.
[254:50.25]Soul of an unknown traveler.
[254:57.81]Maybe I should just break open this thing.
[255:00.93]First playthrough, it's kind of hard to determine what item you even want to hold on to for these souls.
[255:07.96]I'm just going to break it.
[255:10.00]So, sorry guys.
[255:14.10]Second time through, maybe, but I want to level up.
[255:18.12]I want to get some better... Let's just smash this fucking thing.
[255:27.12]That means I can level up another couple times.
[255:29.10]Oh, once.
[255:30.92]Let's check it out.
[255:43.29]Let's check it out.
[255:43.79]Hey, Scythe.
[255:44.35]105, 24.
[255:56.11]The base damage on this thing is even almost potentially better.
[255:58.87]Let's see how cool it is.
[256:04.57]Two-handed.
[256:05.43]You gotta Grim Reap this thing.
[256:11.39]Okay.
[256:12.27]What's the skill on it?
[256:19.13]Neck Swipe.
[256:19.75]This attack aims for the scruff of a foe's neck, and when successful, functions as a headshot, inflicting heavy damage.
[256:28.55]Let's see what that... That is awesome.
[256:32.48]Okay, I might actually use this now.
[256:36.90]I could potentially use this.
[256:39.06]Let's give it a whirl.
[256:40.08]We're going to kill some people with it and see what happens.
[256:46.18]Because it is about the same damage right now as the other one.
[256:51.03]I am totally okay with going full-on Grim Reaper for this first playthrough.
[256:55.19]I got to play the part, too.
[256:55.97]I got to get, like, black robes and stuff.
[256:58.60]I'm willing to do it.
[257:04.86]I'm not going to upgrade it yet.
[257:07.06]I'm seeing people saying upgrade it.
[257:09.68]I want to see if I actually like the way it feels in my hands.
[257:13.72]What about, like, one-handed?
[257:14.60]What's the charge?
[257:15.74]Okay, it's like a big swing.
[257:19.74]Yeah, I want to...
[257:22.23]fight a guy and just see how if it's too slow or how much stamina it uses before I upgrade it.
[257:29.53]Hey, accordion.
[257:31.03]Mr. Accordion!
[257:51.10]I mean, it's kind of slow.
[257:53.92]Wow, why did that do so much damage to him?
[257:57.16]Can I get him, like, right with the... Huh, okay, so I gotta get him right with the pick.
[258:06.59]I'm gonna play with it for a little longer.
[258:10.43]So it looks like if you get them with the tip, it seems to hurt quite a bit.
[258:24.37]Let's get the health back.
[258:26.15]And then I'm going to check out what's... See what the boss room is like.
[258:30.19]Oh, that's the bleed.
[258:32.51]Okay.
[258:39.94]Giant rat.
[258:48.26]He's still alive.
[258:49.21]The health bars in this game...
[258:55.44]are very misleading sometimes because there is such a tiny little spot that it could be.
[259:05.67]Trying to see how big the reach is.
[259:12.31]That's not bad.
[259:14.37]That's not bad.
[259:14.89]That's not bad.
[259:18.15]You got to work on your tip game.
[259:22.27]I'm going to have to.
[259:24.53]If I'm going full-on Grim Reaper, you're gonna have to.
[259:28.60]Sorry, dog.
[259:29.06]You can't climb ladders.
[259:31.04]It's not part of your DNA.
[259:33.50]What's the lunging attack?
[259:36.54]Kind of like a swipe.
[259:39.24]Ooh!
[259:41.64]He got, like, knocked back.
[259:42.48]It's gonna take a little getting used to, but I kind of like it.
[259:48.42]Kind of.
[259:49.88]I haven't made my mind up quite yet.
[259:52.72]He just...
[259:56.09]Okay, I'm like, hold on, I need to get some composure here.
[260:04.55]I did not think they did that.
[260:11.40]I'm trying to like load up the baseball swing.
[260:16.78]Okay, give me safe spot.
[260:27.00]Oh, that guy slam dunked me.
[260:29.44]Hit me right in the face.
[260:38.17]Baseball swing!
[260:39.13]Oh!
[260:42.23]Damn it.
[260:47.73]Doesn't seem very good to do that.
[260:50.13]After doing it a couple times.
[260:51.20]What?
[260:52.32]Teleported.
[260:53.16]He just teleported over here.
[260:55.97]I'm gonna go this way.
[260:57.65]I see a door to open.
[261:00.03]This is a NPC.
[261:01.94]This fucking teleporting dog.
[261:03.90]Is he teleporting?
[261:04.52]Am I going crazy?
[261:06.50]Somebody please tell me if I'm going crazy.
[261:09.20]What a disaster.
[261:09.78]This is a fucking disaster.
[261:12.05]Alright.
[261:15.11]Well.
[261:16.21]We can talk to that guy at the big staff.
[261:22.12]Yeah, I don't think the left trigger seems like something cool.
[261:26.04]Oh, look at this.
[261:30.04]It's not really that good.
[261:32.98]It's not good.
[261:35.02]Unless maybe it works on smaller enemies or something.
[261:39.70]Unfortunately, we have to deal with the rats every time I come down here.
[261:42.68]Maybe not.
[261:43.04]Maybe I can just jump over and skip it.
[261:45.56]Let's give it a try.
[261:47.86]Nope.
[261:48.78]There ain't no skipping the giant rat.
[262:02.56]I do like the Reaper.
[262:05.46]Upgraded.
[262:06.64]Might be very fun.
[262:12.09]It's hard to get used to a new weapon in Dark Souls.
[262:14.53]Especially when you've been the entire game so far been playing with like the dual swords.
[262:18.29]It's like relearning the character again.
[262:28.84]Let's take it slow because I want to go see what that NPC is.
[262:34.24]Waiting for the guy to throw the baseball swing at me.
[262:37.22]Oh, get power slammed.
[262:39.01]I thought he was going to fall off.
[262:41.03]I really did.
[262:43.61]That's why I didn't really follow up.
[262:47.19]Alright.
[262:48.47]Go throw your clay pot.
[262:50.78]I'll be ready for it this time.
[262:51.82]Shit.
[262:56.82]Shit.
[263:02.69]Not good.
[263:03.11]I had to get rid of you before you got here.
[263:06.11]And now the other person's coming.
[263:20.10]Can I hit him?
[263:24.10]You know what?
[263:24.50]I've got to stop being so sloppy.
[263:25.78]I'm just trying to rush through these guys because I just want to not do them.
[263:29.84]I want to not fight them.
[263:39.19]I just want to see the NPC.
[263:41.31]Please leave me alone.
[263:44.67]I don't even care about that guy right now.
[263:47.21]All I care about is seeing what the NPC does.
[263:48.75]Hmm.
[263:59.07]Another one of those unkindled, are you?
[264:01.19]I like his mask.
[264:02.89]All you faceless undead, behaving as if you deserve respect.
[264:07.69]Some Coca-Cola in here?
[264:09.86]No matter.
[264:11.96]Heed my words.
[264:14.30]If you've any sense, you go find a coffin to huddle up inside.
[264:20.74]You, here, in this land of hollows,
[264:24.88]You're like a frail maiden on the front lines.
[264:27.92]If like the others, you're fool enough to play the champion.
[264:32.68]Then go on ahead.
[264:34.64]Traps right past the abandoned church.
[264:37.17]This might be another area, I think, right?
[264:39.15]You'll face death.
[264:41.99]And it won't be pretty.
[264:43.75]Just a random question.
[264:49.44]What happened to the guy that said he pledged his life to me?
[264:54.66]Yeah, I haven't seen that guy yet again.
[264:56.70]Okay, well, way to be a dick about it.
[264:58.64]So this is either the next area or a boss.
[265:05.55]I don't know which one.
[265:26.19]This looks like it.
[265:30.53]Huh?
[265:33.73]Game almost crashed.
[265:38.43]Hello?
[265:43.16]Okay.
[265:45.04]Stay Puft Marshmallow Man decided to come up.
[265:48.12]Or Michelin Man.
[265:48.98]Pick which one you like the best.
[265:50.08]Hmm.
[265:52.34]Oh, pardon me.
[265:53.56]I was absorbed in thought.
[265:56.60]I am Siegvert of Katarina.
[266:00.22]To be honest, I'm in a bit of a pickle.
[266:03.04]This guy was in the other game, wasn't he?
[266:04.28]Onion Knight.
[266:04.72]Okay.
[266:20.44]So I have to get this guy up?
[266:22.88]Should I just fucking attack this guy?
[266:45.86]This kid's giving me riddles.
[266:47.86]Thanks for the riddles.
[266:49.54]This lift only goes down, but one would use their head to go up.
[266:53.89]That's what I thought.
[267:00.33]Punk.
[267:00.77]What was the noise he made?
[267:11.71]He just goes...
[267:15.65]Don't you dare.
[267:16.77]Why?
[267:17.07]What's he gonna do?
[267:18.62]Do you guys see what I have?
[267:23.00]I'm the fucking Grim Reaper.
[267:24.09]I think an onion can kill me.
[267:44.32]That is way too obvious of a you're going to get attacked if you touch that.
[267:50.34]There's an ice dragon guy over here.
[267:54.74]That's a mini version of the boss I fought.
[267:59.02]Whoa!
[268:03.52]Holy shit!
[268:07.56]God!
[268:08.18]Just get me to a corner and drink!
[268:17.90]Pillars are your friend.
[268:29.49]I'm dead.
[268:29.79]I don't know how he completely missed me.
[268:32.37]I'm frostbitten.
[268:37.84]This guy... Holy shit.
[268:47.13]Well, I think, I think I might not supposed to be down here.
[268:53.80]I don't think I'm supposed to go down there, but I have to go get my soul, so we're going down there again.
[268:56.90]Alright, giant rats again.
[269:03.93]These rats are kind of annoying right now.
[269:08.33]Can I get, come on.
[269:09.83]It's a chase.
[269:10.81]The chase is on.
[269:14.21]Come on, can I get up?
[269:16.43]Go!
[269:17.59]Yes, I can.
[269:24.31]What the fuck are you all doing here?
[269:27.29]What is this party?
[269:31.30]This wasn't, this wasn't happening before.
[269:34.80]Those guys were not here.
[269:36.14]I can't, I don't even have a reaction to that.
[269:43.98]The entire map decided to be down there.
[269:51.23]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[269:58.47]Now I'm going up.
[269:59.11]Okay, didn't he want to go?
[270:03.16]You're telling me that guy couldn't figure that out?
[270:12.34]He didn't know that you could go up and down?
[270:15.70]This game is hanging every time I pick up an item right now.
[270:18.84]I'm really scared it's going to crash.
[270:22.01]Each time I touch an item, the game locks for like a full second on my screen.
[270:27.85]It's like... Just in case there's some dumb shit up here.
[270:42.35]Whoa.
[270:42.51]What the hell is this?
[270:53.14]I come in peace.
[270:59.67]Wait.
[271:01.09]This is the guy throwing the exploding spears.
[271:06.95]Right?
[271:08.53]Does that mean he's going to stop?
[271:10.33]I'll talk to him again.
[271:10.85]I just want to make sure I don't miss any items.
[271:17.42]Okay, well, what else do you have to say?
[271:18.82]I...
[271:23.38]Okay.
[271:26.86]I really hope that means he's not going to throw those at me anymore.
[271:33.63]Whatever.
[271:38.19]What do those branches do?
[271:39.23]I'm going to look at these.
[271:41.19]Got a few of them now.
[271:44.99]Where are they?
[271:45.41]There we go.
[271:45.81]Young white branch.
[271:46.57]Transform.
[271:47.07]Blending into environment.
[271:48.85]Transform.
[271:50.41]PvP shit.
[271:56.59]Let me change up my bar a little bit.
[271:58.67]I feel like it's been a little outdated.
[272:05.45]Firebombs.
[272:18.74]No, that solves that issue.
[272:22.30]Kind of.
[272:23.85]I don't think I can do anything else.
[272:25.65]I do want to go down and get my souls.
[272:32.08]Hmm.
[272:34.48]What?
[272:38.84]Hold on a second.
[272:39.76]Wait, wait, wait.
[272:40.32]Is he just, like, hanging out on the ledge over here somewhere?
[272:43.38]Can I, like, jump down and find him?
[272:46.54]Hmm.
[272:47.44]Yeah, okay.
[272:50.70]Alright, say your prayers.
[272:51.64]Let's hope I can hit this.
[272:54.97]Right here.
[272:59.31]Alright, where are you?
[273:02.32]You've hoomed me for the last time.
[273:08.94]There he is.
[273:10.28]Anything else over here?
[273:11.24]No.
[273:11.30]What are you looking at?
[273:13.62]Hmm.
[273:15.78]Hmm.
[273:17.10]Ah.
[273:18.08]Oh.
[273:18.90]Don't disappear like that.
[273:20.48]You had me downright worried.
[273:22.64]That's a big scary enemy.
[273:23.80]Thanks to you, an epiphany has struck me square in the head.
[273:28.96]I've unraveled the riddle of this inscrutable lift.
[273:32.60]Okay.
[273:39.35]On some days, I begin to doubt myself.
[273:42.89]I'm not exactly sure what happened.
[273:47.24]Anyhow, do you see that?
[273:49.97]That humongous beast?
[273:51.97]I do.
[273:53.05]I'm no coward and I have a steady hand, but that thing makes my skin crawl.
[273:58.41]You gonna go kill it for me?
[274:00.16]How now?
[274:01.30]Think twice before you go down that road.
[274:05.76]Why don't you give me a hand?
[274:07.12]I could try talking some sense into him.
[274:11.26]No, I think not.
[274:13.14]He's far too overheated.
[274:16.14]I've got to use my head and think.
[274:22.86]This guy just whinnied the poo.
[274:26.10]I could try to... He is.
[274:30.46]He's just whinnied the poo.
[274:32.85]I want my souls, so I'm not going to go down here.
[274:36.61]What if I just pushed him off?
[274:39.22]Just shove him off right now.
[274:40.48]Oh, I say, what are you doing?
[274:43.14]You're going to get me killed, lad.
[274:45.00]Oh, no, I think I do.
[274:51.32]I cannot make that drop, unfortunately.
[274:58.44]I have to go that way right now.
[275:00.08]I'm going to lose my 3,000 souls.
[275:01.46]There's not a safe way for me to get down, I don't think.
[275:08.35]No.
[275:09.71]Too risky.
[275:14.69]I could... I... Well, hold on.
[275:17.72]What happened... Let's try shooting him with a bow and arrow.
[275:31.97]Maybe that'll help.
[275:40.61]That didn't help.
[275:41.09]That didn't help.
[275:43.63]Here we go.
[275:49.61]Can I break this?
[275:55.28]That looks very breakable to me.
[275:57.06]Solid Snape.
[276:10.37]Welcome, Solid Snake.
[276:13.10]You got an interesting name.
[276:21.64]Should I go get him?
[276:24.34]I don't think going and getting him is a good idea.
[276:29.00]But what choice do I have?
[276:37.41]What?
[276:38.19]What are you talking about?
[276:39.39]Oh my god!
[276:39.89]He's gonna fight him!
[276:42.14]Nice!
[276:42.44]Get him!
[276:43.66]Oh my god!
[276:44.26]He's doing one damage.
[276:44.88]Alright, you two just fight it out.
[276:46.04]I don't want to be a part of this.
[277:10.71]I'll just hit him in the head when he comes close enough.
[277:15.22]Oh, look at this coward.
[277:17.34]Yeah, go get him, Siegfried!
[277:23.98]This guy's awesome.
[277:26.52]Didn't even have a health bar either.
[277:27.68]I hope he can't get knocked off the edge, because that would be sad.
[277:38.68]Watch out!
[277:39.68]Watch out!
[277:43.66]Wow.
[277:46.59]He's just gonna keep breathing, isn't he?
[277:51.81]I fell.
[277:52.51]I fucking fell.
[277:54.79]Go get him, Siegfried.
[277:59.65]Why are you going after me?
[278:02.47]Why are you going after me?
[278:05.55]I don't know where to go.
[278:08.54]Get away from me.
[278:12.15]Oh, you're gonna have to hold on a second.
[278:13.61]Somebody subscribed.
[278:14.57]I don't know who it was.
[278:16.59]Scout girl.
[278:18.45]Hold on.
[278:20.73]A little bit of an issue here.
[278:28.84]We're not gonna play like a coward.
[278:34.83]Yes, we are.
[278:36.15]I take back everything I just said.
[278:41.40]You know guys, it's time to play fire with fire!
[278:48.26]I did 12 damage.
[278:52.02]He'll kill him eventually.
[278:53.05]I don't want to risk dying right now.
[278:59.27]I have to get the last hit.
[279:00.25]I gotta get the last hit.
[279:01.01]I need to get the loot.
[279:04.23]I got it!
[279:04.77]Alright, last hit.
[279:05.63]That means I get all the gear.
[279:09.48]Fire gem.
[279:13.70]That was really cool.
[279:17.96]Now what are you gonna say?
[279:22.44]That was quite a performance.
[279:24.32]Yeah, good job, dude.
[279:25.12]But you mustn't get in over your head.
[279:28.09]We unkindled must put our duties first.
[279:31.23]I like this guy.
[279:31.93]But, for the moment, we've a toast to make.
[279:35.05]Yeah, let's toast to some champagne.
[279:37.09]Sieg Brau.
[279:38.47]To your valor, my sword, and our victory together.
[279:45.59]I kind of feel bad for hitting him.
[279:53.35]Toast.
[279:54.55]He's going to sleep right here.
[280:01.36]Sorry for my inconvenience, sub.
[280:08.84]No, it's fine.
[280:10.42]Don't worry about it.
[280:11.50]Thanks for subbing.
[280:12.72]You shouldn't have to apologize for subscribing.
[280:15.99]Thank you.
[280:18.31]So, he's asleep?
[280:20.51]Oh, you can learn sleep too.
[280:21.75]That's funny.
[280:25.09]Okay.
[280:27.22]Uh, what is that?
[280:28.90]Siegbrue.
[280:31.84]Restores HP and boosts frost resist.
[280:33.90]Okay.
[280:35.50]Interesting.
[280:37.58]Well, it was nice to meet you.
[280:43.40]But I feel like it's time for us to part ways.
[280:48.70]My character is seriously so dumb.
[280:51.55]What a shit character.
[280:52.49]So can I wrap around and get back there?
[280:54.85]This might be a bone time.
[280:57.39]It might be time for a homework bone.
[281:00.89]Because I feel like I'm just completely skipping a boss right now.
[281:04.41]And I have a lot of souls.
[281:05.21]I'm going to have like six or seven thousand.
[281:10.82]We'll take a couple of quick ganders around the area.
[281:16.84]Am I still having crashing problems?
[281:18.10]I am not anymore.
[281:19.40]It keeps feeling like it's going to, but it doesn't.
[281:22.37]It was really only the first few minutes of the game.
[281:25.37]The first, like, 20 minutes were kind of nightmarish.
[281:27.69]I crashed, what, like, two or three times?
[281:31.79]Ace Cow.
[281:40.68]Ace Cow.
[281:41.10]Thanks for the sub.
[281:41.94]Hope I'm saying your name right.
[281:47.60]Ain't gonna fool me.
[281:48.98]This one's gonna drop.
[281:49.70]I guess not.
[281:56.03]Red bug pellet.
[282:01.05]Temporarily boost fire damage absorption.
[282:05.21]I'm going to take a wild guess and say that there's a fire boss.
[282:08.34]Probably in this area.
[282:09.40]I don't know why there wouldn't be.
[282:13.47]All the fire damage.
[282:17.33]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[282:18.67]I knew one of them.
[282:19.55]There it is.
[282:20.91]You would think you're so sneaky.
[282:22.50]Here comes the baseball swing.
[282:24.98]I missed.
[282:29.02]Come on.
[282:30.50]Come on.
[282:31.42]I know you got it in you.
[282:37.50]Please.
[282:39.22]There's two of them.
[282:43.35]real quick this thing thankfully can go through the cage with a big swing really?
[283:08.52]okay
[283:13.75]Doing a little too much wandering for my own good here.
[283:21.68]Stuff like this is what gets you killed.
[283:25.91]In the game of Dark Souls, in the universe of Soulsborne.
[283:29.35]Really?
[283:35.74]Really?
[283:36.58]Really?
[283:46.45]Really?
[283:46.75]That's it, right?
[283:56.42]These tree guys are really... I like these enemies.
[283:59.56]They're not even enemies.
[284:00.90]I like these set pieces.
[284:08.34]Look at how many are in here.
[284:11.39]Might be worth... Is there any item in here?
[284:13.55]No.
[284:13.61]There's a chest right there.
[284:25.32]You're not going to come down?
[284:28.19]Okay.
[284:29.29]I can deal with two, so I'll just get two down here.
[284:31.79]I don't want to waste all of these.
[284:38.30]Is it only when I open the chest?
[284:41.62]I believe so.
[284:42.18]Okay.
[284:51.56]Still have not found a use for that.
[285:02.56]Hey.
[285:05.47]Really?
[285:08.57]Just like that super snarky attitude.
[285:11.63]Like, I shouldn't have got hit by that.
[285:13.25]Really?
[285:21.23]Alright.
[285:22.17]What is in the chest?
[285:24.77]Human pine resin.
[285:27.29]Human pine resin.
[285:31.18]Dark to your right hand.
[285:34.60]Cool.
[285:37.40]Uh, cool.
[285:42.52]What's behind the bookcase?
[285:43.32]Anything?
[285:44.26]Sometimes they hide rooms behind the bookcases.
[285:46.66]I've played this game.
[285:51.04]Alright, there's a grandmother over here.
[285:53.40]I've got to be careful.
[285:57.36]I thought I was just seeing double for a second.
[285:58.94]There's two grandmothers.
[286:02.58]Put my glasses on for this one.
[286:05.85]This actually might be kind of hard.
[286:08.31]I'm just going to throw a bomb.
[286:18.55]Yeah.
[286:19.41]Yep.
[286:22.78]Yep.
[286:25.04]Yep.
[286:26.16]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[286:29.49]Following me?
[286:31.25]Bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone.
[286:43.24]Whew.
[286:43.94]That's way too many souls to potentially sacrifice.
[286:46.28]Plus, I want to kill the boss.
[286:47.22]That's like over there.
[286:48.62]I'm going to upgrade the scythe.
[286:54.53]And we will be golden.
[286:56.93]Let's give the scythe a plus one.
[287:07.29]Can you do that for free?
[287:15.36]Oh.
[287:17.64]Five.
[287:19.26]Anything to repair?
[287:20.18]Nope.
[287:21.30]Infuse weapon.
[287:22.34]I just want to see what this is.
[287:26.25]Okay, this is raw gem, which turns it into... This is... I never did this in any of the old Dark Souls games.
[287:42.74]Essentially, you sacrifice... You turn it into an elemental weapon, right?
[287:50.98]Or this one is... What is it called?
[287:52.36]Mundane or something?
[287:55.51]I don't know.
[287:56.57]I'm not sure what would be better for the scythe.
[288:03.26]115 plus 28 and doing the gem makes it... It's always confused me.
[288:11.71]Because that looks like way... 136?
[288:14.13]Yeah, you lose scaling.
[288:25.10]Um, I think I'm just going to stay just safe in what I know.
[288:30.02]Again, I'll say it again for like the 10,000th time.
[288:36.07]I want my first playthrough to be very safe.
[288:39.59]Mundane skills off your lowest stat.
[288:41.51]Okay.
[288:44.15]I'm going to do just upgrade the scythe with a regular scythe.
[288:47.56]Upgrade scythe.
[288:48.38]I'm going to do it
[288:56.99]Yeah.
[289:02.89]Need two more shards.
[289:07.11]Could do.
[289:10.15]So they took out being able to upgrade gear, huh?
[289:14.97]Because that was not in Bloodborne.
[289:19.25]Or I don't want to be.
[289:20.61]I don't want to.
[289:28.20]Okay.
[289:30.08]So this is D&C.
[289:38.97]I'm assuming the hard caps or the soft caps are the same.
[289:44.07]With it being, what, 25?
[289:46.05]And then 50 for essentially a hard cap or 40 for some things.
[289:49.15]Are we ever going to get a scream cam?
[289:55.31]I don't think so.
[289:57.56]Not today.
[290:05.99]More endurance, more endurance.
[290:17.07]Farewell.
[290:17.61]Glasses cam.
[290:28.23]No, but let's kill a boss.
[290:31.58]Let's go for a boss, huh?
[290:35.56]What is that?
[290:41.32]That Jupiter was not... That's Jupiter with a weird party mask on.
[290:47.44]Jupiter is going to the grand ball.
[291:01.84]Mm-hmm.
[291:03.86]Climb, climb, climb, climb, climb.
[291:05.84]Okay, so we've gone this way.
[291:07.94]That way's... They're all here again.
[291:10.30]I swear to God.
[291:16.27]I don't know what is going on with that, but I feel like that's the second time in a row that's happened, and it shouldn't happen.
[291:22.05]Shouldn't happen.
[291:22.75]Shouldn't happen.
[291:23.43]Shouldn't happen.
[291:32.23]Let's see what's in this room.
[291:37.24]Great curse ridden tree.
[291:38.86]Oh no, there's a curse.
[291:44.03]Left.
[291:46.49]Maybe a fake wall?
[291:59.65]Alright, does everybody... Does every single person put one of these in front of a wall just to say there's an illusion ahead?
[292:10.76]Like, we get the joke.
[292:12.54]What a funny joke.
[292:18.58]Oh, look, I wonder what this says.
[292:20.16]This is a secret passage ahead.
[292:21.67]I got ya.
[292:38.39]Alright, what do we got?
[292:40.11]You got something for me?
[292:43.75]Ooh.
[292:45.51]That's a spooky tree.
[292:46.95]Are these...?
[292:49.81]I have to fight them?
[292:57.87]Of course I do.
[292:59.43]Why wouldn't I?
[292:59.89]I have to fight them.
[293:07.76]The Grim Reaper!
[293:11.81]Time to reap!
[293:14.55]Who says that?
[293:14.99]I got a hint for you.
[293:18.86]It's from Overwatch.
[293:34.96]Didn't want to hit forward Alright, so here we go you guys you guys want to know after playing for a few hours One of the only things I do not like about this game It's really the only thing I can think of at this point the forward right like r1 is horrible I Really fucking hate that it's like that Because how many times have you seen me just accidentally like do this move?
[294:03.35]I'm fighting a boss right now.
[294:04.47]I
[294:11.05]Oh no!
[294:12.59]It's the giant tree, the cursed, rotting, great wood.
[294:22.60]Alright, well let's see what he does.
[294:25.64]What?
[294:31.60]Can you even unbind it, though?
[294:32.72]Someone said unbind it.
[294:33.58]I don't even know if you can.
[294:35.22]Doesn't seem like a thing that's unbindable.
[294:36.44]Ah, the flesh.
[294:38.00]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[294:42.33]Geez, I thought... Where are these people coming from?
[294:49.64]They're just, like, all standing up in random places.
[294:57.46]Like, is it just going to keep coming over here?
[295:00.62]Or are these people following me?
[295:03.76]Just let them kill them.
[295:04.80]Who cares?
[295:05.26]Come on.
[295:08.13]Swing around.
[295:10.71]Lava 287.
[295:11.31]During the boss fight.
[295:13.99]They are just dropping down.
[295:15.57]Okay, so I don't think I can... I have to... The Lava told me to destroy if I have to.
[295:27.88]That doesn't hurt him.
[295:30.22]That doesn't hurt him either.
[295:32.54]Going for the legs?
[295:33.18]Is that the strategy we're doing here?
[295:34.96]I think so.
[295:38.28]Maybe.
[295:40.62]He doesn't seem particularly difficult.
[295:44.39]As long as you can... I gotta find where I can... Ah, I think I have to hit him in the nutsack.
[295:50.41]Yeah, right?
[295:51.13]Yeah, definitely.
[295:59.81]I got hit, but I didn't take damage.
[296:00.99]That was really odd.
[296:10.94]Is he healing?
[296:12.32]I think he is healing.
[296:17.78]Alright, I'm confused.
[296:22.51]Or is he not?
[296:26.31]There we go.
[296:28.92]He's just spread right now.
[296:30.68]Legs?
[296:32.58]Hey, you know what would be super fucking awesome?
[296:35.16]If this boss didn't have a bunch of moron enemies that just came.
[296:39.02]WHAAAA?
[296:44.88]Oh god.
[296:45.48]I feel like I'm on a Universal Studios ride.
[297:09.52]Okay, his hand takes a lot of damage.
[297:11.04]Good to know.
[297:14.94]Shit, that was quick.
[297:15.88]That was really fast.
[297:26.66]I know, you gotta hit him right in his, like, bubbles.
[297:29.28]Once you get him in the bubbles, you... That didn't roll, but it hit me.
[297:36.80]Oh, no.
[297:38.67]Don't swallow me.
[297:40.54]Come on, burst his bubbles!
[297:47.79]Come on!
[297:53.71]Just get out of the way.
[297:55.51]My bearings... The bubble on his front is almost gone.
[298:01.12]Well, now that I know he, like, drops you through the floor...
[298:17.55]Come on, bring it down.
[298:20.28]Shit!
[298:20.56]I was trying to dodge.
[298:21.20]I didn't have stamina.
[298:22.06]I'm gonna die.
[298:24.52]I am gonna die.
[298:28.22]Right when I burst the other bubble, too.
[298:34.25]Okay, well, now I understand.
[298:36.15]He can probably burst his legs, too.
[298:40.75]Yep.
[298:46.25]I should get him next time.
[298:53.49]He's got these little boils all over him.
[298:59.39]Where have I not bursted?
[299:03.55]Right underneath his left thigh.
[299:07.18]Yeah, I'm dead.
[299:09.92]Okay, this should go a little bit more smoothly.
[299:14.80]Uh, Victor Foxtrot.
[299:16.46]Thanks for subbing.
[299:20.82]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[299:30.47]Welcome!
[299:32.59]Come on.
[299:34.69]These little shit rats.
[299:44.11]Kill King 73.
[299:45.93]Thanks, dude.
[299:47.43]We have to go through the carnival of people.
[299:56.16]Welcome, though.
[299:56.68]Welcome back.
[299:58.24]Still on me?
[299:58.92]How many are you following me on?
[300:00.10]Let's just start swinging.
[300:03.16]Oh, an item.
[300:03.44]I didn't even see that item.
[300:16.18]They're really screwing this up for me right now stupid.
[300:20.24]Oh my god.
[300:20.86]I'm going to scream There's nothing worse than the fast obnoxious enemies you have to run into every time
[300:30.81]Now I only have three.
[300:32.59]Well, I'm probably gonna lose, but I'm going to just give it another go.
[300:37.62]Try to get into my muscle memory.
[300:42.10]All his moves.
[300:43.48]And who knows?
[300:43.84]Maybe it'll, uh... Maybe it'll be better.
[300:47.37]But fuck, man.
[300:48.27]I hate these stupid guys that are just everywhere.
[301:02.45]Grim Reaper.
[301:03.95]Mr. Moobler!
[301:04.65]I'm gonna try, Moobler.
[301:11.15]I am going to try.
[301:11.97]Thanks for something, though.
[301:14.01]Welcome.
[301:14.28]I need to get rid of as many of these people as I can.
[301:25.65]Okay, so okay.
[301:26.51]I got it.
[301:26.81]I got it.
[301:27.07]I got it.
[301:27.83]I think if you kill that guy the boss spawns I think that's like the bosses avatar That would make some sense because it seems like I killed him and then maybe it's a certain amount Alright, we're gonna go for egg sack on leg just to see oh
[301:55.17]I guess you have to get this one.
[302:10.84]Oh shit, he's doing the spit thing.
[302:20.18]Watch the step watch the watch the stamina and watch the guy with the sledgehammers That are just kind of coming all over the place
[302:42.47]There it is.
[302:43.53]Let's get this one, too, if we can.
[302:45.05]Or let's, like, have to worry about the fucking shit enemies.
[302:49.65]Aye, aye, aye.
[302:54.58]There we go.
[302:55.20]I wish he took damage from this.
[302:57.42]That'd be funny.
[302:57.90]If he just took, like, fall damage.
[303:05.22]It's kind of hard to hit that one.
[303:06.51]There are items around here, though.
[303:13.68]Maybe that just picks him up.
[303:17.96]Oh, that's a shield.
[303:21.02]Here comes a hand.
[303:26.77]Wow!
[303:26.93]Did not know he... I thought he was going to just try to swipe at me.
[303:28.97]Nobody's here.
[303:43.24]Ooh, got ya.
[303:45.90]Where else can I hit?
[303:52.95]I don't think I had very many souls, but... Alright, that hand over there looks like it's ready to burst!
[304:07.84]That one.
[304:08.50]In the back.
[304:14.08]Yeah, it is.
[304:20.98]It's so hard to hit this thing!
[304:25.45]It's like boil on his hand.
[304:26.93]Alright, where is another one?
[304:32.61]In the back.
[304:35.37]Be careful.
[304:41.15]I'm having more trouble finding where his zits are than anything else.
[304:49.18]More on this hand.
[304:52.72]Shit, that wasn't really working.
[304:56.79]Alright, note to self.
[304:59.63]I don't think you want to be in front of him.
[305:04.11]It looks like you break all the things around him and then... Maybe you do have to hit him in the hand.
[305:13.31]What do I have for... Let's go for maybe some resin or some charcoal or something.
[305:19.82]Might be worth it.
[305:20.94]Just to try to burn him down.
[305:30.94]I wonder if he takes fire damage.
[305:37.51]I also went in there with three Estus Flasks.
[305:39.73]So...
[305:41.53]I mean, that's not the end of the world, but it's not the greatest thing in the world, is it?
[305:45.47]Okay, we're done.
[305:57.83]Here's the whole troop of people that always seem to be out here.
[306:09.79]I'm going to try the other technique to not kill the guy on the right.
[306:12.67]Fuck you guys.
[306:15.55]I don't even care.
[306:15.93]I'm just going to go.
[306:18.71]He is a tree.
[306:19.37]Yeah, he is.
[306:20.23]Wood burns.
[306:21.24]Wood does burn.
[306:22.88]That's the theory.
[306:32.78]I actually want to take off some of this useless shit so I don't just like scroll through a million times.
[306:40.60]Might be worth taking a Blossom as well.
[306:43.98]Alright, don't kill the guy with the red eyes.
[306:45.72]Let's see if I can get rid of all these dudes before he spawns.
[306:50.60]Ah, come on.
[307:01.75]Nope.
[307:03.65]So, I guess it's just after a certain amount of time?
[307:05.91]Or do we have to kill three of them?
[307:12.98]J.M.
[307:13.66]Lee, welcome to Jurassic Park.
[307:32.69]More of you are coming.
[307:39.90]So I need to kill that guy because he is actually the annoying one.
[307:44.88]The rest of them really are kind of chumpy.
[307:50.05]I don't think I'm going to use the charcoal until the next phase.
[307:54.43]I feel like it might be a waste.
[308:04.73]Get out of my way!
[308:12.59]Unicorn horde that is the plan unicorn.
[308:17.56]Thank you for subbing welcome Okay
[308:36.35]No, I mean, I made the joke before, the really joke, but I mean, like, really.
[308:43.12]Not one of those tucked in.
[308:44.08]I mean, I made the really joke, but sometimes the really joke is actually real.
[308:50.46]Okay.
[309:00.64]He's coming.
[309:01.30]Oh, shit.
[309:01.90]He's stepping in the corrosive goo.
[309:08.11]There's a big one on his back, but doesn't seem reachable.
[309:11.40]Reliably reachable.
[309:22.75]You're not dead?
[309:26.19]How are you not dead?
[309:27.83]Aye, aye, aye.
[309:44.49]Jebus I'm trying I Didn't get hit did not get hit confirm confirm it Oh
[310:09.91]Stand up!
[310:19.45]Something else I've noticed too.
[310:20.51]I think he drops when you break the one in the middle.
[310:24.39]I think.
[310:33.18]Stand up.
[310:34.16]Get away from me!
[310:35.06]You ruin everything!
[310:42.93]It's almost like they sat around him and said, hey, guys on the development team, how do we fucking ruin this boss fight?
[310:49.29]I have an idea.
[310:50.73]Let's spawn a bunch of shitty enemies everywhere.
[310:56.29]And maybe some of them will have fucking giant sledgehammers, too.
[311:03.65]Because that is really the worst part of this first.
[311:08.98]The first phase is actually harder, I think.
[311:11.97]Because you have to deal with all these fucking assholes.
[311:15.95]Unless, like, is there, like, a thing... Can I, like, break the tree or something?
[311:18.64]Can I, like, burn the tree down?
[311:19.72]I'm glad that guy's stuck over there.
[311:32.79]Wow.
[311:39.61]Good throwing shit.
[311:45.36]I don't even know where I am.
[311:46.26]I'm inside of his body.
[311:52.80]I think this one was a wash, unfortunately.
[311:54.91]Oh my god.
[312:01.67]I don't understand why these enemies are necessary, really.
[312:05.12]Like, let's be fucking real.
[312:18.27]I think this one's over.
[312:19.43]I'm not going to use a fine resin on this one.
[312:26.07]There we go.
[312:29.48]Yeah, strategy is you have to get him down here real fast.
[312:34.50]The spawning of those enemies is fucking horrid.
[312:46.58]Seems like I got him closer than I did last time.
[313:00.41]No SS blasts.
[313:01.87]Wowee!
[313:02.55]I'm gonna get in front of him.
[313:24.96]Pop the middle one as fast as possible.
[313:28.12]Might just throw firebombs at his balls.
[313:29.96]Because you have to race to get him to fall.
[313:41.95]Otherwise you have to deal with those stupid adds the entire time.
[313:46.24]His middle pustules are the ones that make him drop down.
[313:51.30]So that's the plan.
[313:53.24]Just firebomb the absolute shit out of this guy's crotchial area.
[313:58.67]Oh no.
[314:00.75]Does he really jump up like a dog?
[314:03.77]Hey, street fox!
[314:15.62]That's right up my ass!
[314:19.46]Oh my god, those guys were so close!
[314:22.73]I don't even have fire- I gotta get fire bombs in the bar so I have to kill the dogs.
[314:26.73]Actually, no I don't.
[314:27.75]I have time when I get in there.
[314:30.77]I have all the time in the world!
[314:31.87]Look at me!
[314:36.55]Just kinda close.
[314:38.75]What is this dog doing?
[314:39.43]I'm gonna replace this with this.
[314:50.38]Let's see what happens.
[314:56.99]So if it is killing three of them, then theoretically, you'd want to kill these two.
[315:03.29]Or whatever.
[315:04.23]Just make sure this guy goes away.
[315:06.73]This guy's the hardest of them all.
[315:14.90]Okay.
[315:16.24]Throw firebomb at crotch.
[315:18.60]Let's see what happens.
[315:21.03]I don't know how good this is going to work, but we can try.
[315:24.33]I don't think that's good.
[315:27.99]I don't think that's good.
[315:33.80]So that did 95 damage.
[315:43.46]Ooh, he's spamming at me.
[315:45.75]Champagne has always been celebrated.
[315:47.79]It's excellence.
[315:53.78]Just gotta get it down fast.
[315:55.58]This is so horrible.
[316:07.27]Shit, I didn't dodge it.
[316:14.84]I wish I didn't do the corrosive acid.
[316:18.36]Ah, he's doing it.
[316:20.30]Oh boy, not good.
[316:21.56]I thought it went away.
[316:23.51]It's kind of deceiving.
[316:24.73]It looks like it's going away, then it comes right back.
[316:35.97]Break it.
[316:38.38]Mm-hmm.
[316:51.76]Don't let him fall back on you.
[316:55.76]It's not what you want to do right now.
[317:01.68]God.
[317:02.23]Fucking stupid adds.
[317:10.45]Please leave me alone.
[317:12.01]I was wasting so much time killing them.
[317:21.58]I miraculously didn't get hit by that.
[317:23.18]I didn't get hit by that, though.
[317:34.25]Hold on.
[317:34.61]I'm just gonna take a look.
[317:36.75]Because these guys are so obnoxious that I feel like I can do something to stop it from happening.
[317:43.20]Let's take a look around.
[317:47.20]Where's the onion guy?
[317:48.16]He could, like, really help me right now.
[317:53.51]I don't think so.
[317:54.21]I think they're just here for good.
[317:55.35]Or maybe the next time, what I'll try to do... I'm just gonna... For the remainder of this fight, I'm just going to kill them and run around.
[318:07.21]And just see if there's a spawn limit, which I highly doubt there is.
[318:09.97]I think they just spawn forever until he drops down.
[318:18.61]Let's see.
[318:21.05]I mean, it has been a fair... It's been a long... No, no way.
[318:24.83]How long has this fight been going on?
[318:25.81]Like, at least a few minutes?
[318:26.59]I would be shocked at this point.
[318:36.86]And he's going to crush me.
[318:41.20]Whoa!
[318:42.60]I'm in the goo.
[318:48.82]Yeah, this one's a wash.
[318:49.54]I'm going to have to try it again.
[318:50.48]I'm going to have to try it again, unfortunately.
[318:54.23]Getting to... Okay, ready for me to start complaining?
[318:58.11]Okay, here comes the complain.
[319:00.57]Here comes my complaining.
[319:04.29]Getting this boss to the boss fight makes you have to use half your Estus Blast.
[319:11.24]For me to fight this boss in the boss fight... This right now is the boss fight.
[319:16.94]Getting to the boss fight, you have to do the pre-boss fight.
[319:21.58]And that's fucking horrible.
[319:25.95]There's my complaint.
[319:26.63]Complaint over.
[319:30.31]It's gonna take a fucking Christmas miracle to kill him now.
[319:45.94]Maybe I should try the baseball swing on this dude.
[319:56.74]No.
[319:57.40]Please don't do it.
[319:58.80]Don't do it.
[319:59.92]I beg of you.
[320:05.41]Starting fresh.
[320:10.77]Phase 2 seems way... Yeah, I mean, that's what I mean.
[320:12.63]Like, Phase 2 seems like, alright, time for you to fight this boss!
[320:16.93]phase one is get ready to fight the boss you're not gonna fight him yet you have to deal with the never-ending enemies that spawn so with that being said maybe it is a good idea to put charcoal on immediately because if it's that much trouble to get them to go down and maybe it's worth doing shit
[320:47.18]Wow.
[320:52.50]Alright, you... Do you all seriously have to be right here?
[321:00.38]Why is this happening?
[321:01.24]I'm gonna die.
[321:01.94]I'm gonna die.
[321:03.83]Like, they're all just stuffed when you walk out the door.
[321:08.63]Just kill me.
[321:09.71]Fucking kill me.
[321:10.63]This is a complete waste of two Estus Flasks.
[321:21.09]Those guys are in such a weird enemy pattern.
[321:24.83]It's almost like they're all not supposed to be there.
[321:32.29]Okay, let's just, like, stuff, like, fucking nine enemies and right, right, I'm going the wrong way.
[321:36.31]I'm so fucking mad right now I'm going the wrong way.
[321:40.73]Let's have, like, three dogs, two sludge hammer guys, a grandmother lady.
[321:44.45]She wasn't there.
[321:45.17]By the way, that person was not there when you came down here the first time.
[321:50.01]Oh, there's just fucking, like, ten people there.
[321:52.13]All, like, spawning and walking in a circle when you get there.
[321:59.84]It wouldn't make me as angry as it does if it didn't do that before.
[322:06.24]It didn't do it before.
[322:12.58]That guy?
[322:13.20]Look at this guy.
[322:14.20]This guy wasn't here.
[322:16.48]Like, what the fuck is this guy doing here?
[322:17.90]Look at him.
[322:19.38]He's just walking into the wall for no reason.
[322:22.14]He's just not... This dude's... This dude is just walking around in a circle on a rock over here.
[322:29.36]This guy serves no purpose.
[322:33.70]Where's the grandmother?
[322:36.30]She's up here now.
[322:39.71]We're all walking to the boss.
[322:41.31]Are we all going to fight the boss together?
[322:45.80]Snouse rifle.
[322:51.74]Now I have to drink.
[322:52.64]The enemies have a spawn point, then they walk in a pattern.
[322:58.13]No, I understand that, but if you go back to the VOD, if you rewind it, those guys were not all there.
[323:07.29]They just somehow decided to be there now.
[323:12.53]So what we're doing, Charcoal Resident, we're gonna go just smash the absolute hell out of this guy.
[323:18.31]Okay, don't drive angry.
[323:23.94]Don't drive angry.
[323:26.50]Kill this guy, take the buff.
[323:28.46]Don't drive angry.
[323:31.91]Let's go.
[323:32.27]I'm coming for you.
[323:45.88]Where's my... Huh?
[323:51.12]Huh?
[323:54.54]Did he blow it out?
[323:55.40]That didn't last very long at all.
[324:07.91]Okay.
[324:09.83]Okay.
[324:11.61]I guess.
[324:22.84]Get away from me with the nunchucks.
[324:24.78]I felt like I had nunchucks.
[324:30.81]The way he was running at me, he was just like, I'm coming at you with these nunchucks!
[324:51.65]Get away.
[324:56.19]Kill them.
[324:57.40]Kill the mummy.
[325:01.78]Oh, he's rolling in.
[325:02.78]What is this move?
[325:03.48]He didn't do this move before.
[325:13.07]Ugh.
[325:22.62]He's still alive.
[325:35.78]Oh, boy.
[325:36.38]Come on.
[325:37.24]Break.
[325:38.17]He broke.
[325:43.33]Okay.
[325:44.75]Let's relax here a little bit.
[325:48.45]And I'm gonna take the resin again.
[325:50.11]I'm gonna be cool for this one.
[325:51.91]I'm gonna be calm.
[326:03.47]What?
[326:03.79]Okay, something's really... I don't... What the fuck?
[326:07.25]I'm actually mad about this.
[326:09.46]Something's going on with that resin.
[326:10.98]It's only on this weapon for like eight seconds.
[326:15.26]What is that?
[326:16.60]That seems like total diarrhea.
[326:19.89]Okay.
[326:20.91]Well, that... I can't fucking believe that shit.
[326:27.23]Can you not put fire on the... I don't get it.
[326:32.37]If I roll, it blows the fire out.
[326:33.93]Is that what you're telling me?
[326:35.31]No fucking way!
[326:37.03]No way!
[326:38.62]There is no way that rolling blows the fire out.
[326:44.64]That was less than 10 seconds.
[326:47.82]I put the gold pine resin on and it was like a full minute.
[326:52.02]I'm going to need an explanation FromSoftware.
[327:00.29]Just gotta be careful.
[327:07.91]Just be careful.
[327:10.85]Don't do anything stupid.
[327:16.32]Where is it?
[327:17.06]The guy's foot?
[327:17.60]Nope.
[327:18.12]He's going back here.
[327:19.72]I can't even tell.
[327:23.06]His whole body looks the damn same.
[327:35.49]Oh, shit.
[327:36.03]Where did this heal?
[327:43.37]Come on.
[327:52.39]Use the gold miner as in problem solved.
[327:53.99]Maybe.
[327:55.31]But that just, I don't know, that just seems really like it's kind of not supposed to be happening.
[328:03.33]What is he doing?
[328:04.55]Standing up now?
[328:09.23]I can't jump it.
[328:17.22]Yeah, go ahead and lie down.
[328:20.42]Oh, get away from his hand.
[328:23.39]I don't want to be in front of that hand.
[328:24.55]I want him to do, like, the roll again.
[328:37.85]He does... Oh, god!
[328:48.33]I asked for it and I got it.
[328:52.18]It's on his leg.
[328:55.24]Fall down so I can hit you on the leg again.
[328:56.62]Come on.
[329:04.45]I'll take all day doing this.
[329:05.95]I'm gonna do this as slow as possible.
[329:09.87]I gotta get you right in that, like, Achilles.
[329:12.91]Shit.
[329:13.29]Not good.
[329:14.97]Very not good.
[329:16.23]I think I'm screwed here.
[329:25.81]Had it close, too.
[329:27.83]Got at least close enough.
[329:28.99]I don't think I have anything in my inventory that's gonna help me here.
[329:33.19]Do I have, like, a... I think, actually, no, I do have the heal.
[329:36.69]I think it's worth doing that.
[329:43.21]Where's the next pus thing?
[329:45.39]In his back?
[329:48.17]His elbow, right in front of him.
[329:52.31]Oh, lord!
[329:57.84]Where is it?
[330:00.91]No, not his legs.
[330:01.73]Maybe his hand?
[330:02.49]Or am I going to have to start hitting him right in this, like, sack?
[330:08.07]There's one on his elbow.
[330:08.93]I know that.
[330:10.02]His right elbow.
[330:10.86]Let's try to get to his right elbow.
[330:14.80]He's going to flop down here in a second.
[330:22.73]Yeah, I got to get him in the elbow.
[330:29.50]Do the fall.
[330:30.18]It's not the fall.
[330:32.88]You're just like shit in your pants.
[330:45.72]Stay near his right elbow.
[330:47.02]Stay near his oboe.
[330:52.09]Fall down.
[330:52.57]Do it.
[330:54.81]Stop doing the poop move.
[331:00.04]He's got his knee, too.
[331:01.10]Let's see his left knee.
[331:07.19]It's too bad.
[331:07.61]This is like a toast run.
[331:13.14]Right elbow or left knee?
[331:16.84]Right?
[331:17.04]Looks like it.
[331:17.60]I can't really tell anymore.
[331:19.02]My eyes are not adjusting to what he's doing.
[331:26.23]I would have hit this.
[331:27.83]I'm so scared.
[331:28.65]Come on, flop!
[331:30.27]I don't think he's going to do it.
[331:34.81]Maybe I broke his legs too much.
[331:36.09]Anywhere else that I can hit him?
[331:44.46]Right in the gut, I guess.
[331:46.46]I'm dead.
[331:55.58]I'm going to try this with Pine Resin, if I haven't, and see what happens.
[331:58.30]I don't know.
[332:01.02]Let me see this.
[332:01.98]I want to look at the item.
[332:03.74]Because I really do feel like I'm being ripped off right now.
[332:12.14]I mean, is it because of this?
[332:13.86]Is it really like five seconds?
[332:21.90]That has to be what it is, then.
[332:27.16]Alright, well, I don't remember that being in any of the old games.
[332:30.32]There's two different types of... There's pine resin and then pine bundle?
[332:34.54]Okay.
[332:39.97]I guess that makes more sense.
[332:43.33]Don't ask me what the point of that item is.
[332:50.34]I'm not sure I can give you a reason why Pine Bundle is in the game.
[332:55.15]By the time you apply that, and swing at somebody, you have to like... Hold on a second, I have to deal with a bunch of annoying rats.
[333:05.45]I might be dead here.
[333:12.58]Hold on, look at the grouped up fucking moron enemies.
[333:16.56]They're all in the exact same spot.
[333:24.32]In fact, one of them was inside of the other one.
[333:30.15]Oh, boy.
[333:30.57]I'm getting chased hard.
[333:31.47]Let's try it again.
[333:40.61]Oh, boy.
[333:41.19]I'm sorry.
[333:41.55]I just, like, touched my microphone.
[333:43.13]I made a loud banging sound.
[333:48.08]Let's try it again.
[333:48.86]This boss is giving me all kinds of trouble.
[333:56.86]This might be the most attempts on a boss in any of the Dark Souls games that I've played.
[334:02.88]At least Dark Souls 2.
[334:03.52]I don't think I ever played a boss more than like five or six times in Dark Souls 2.
[334:11.37]But he sure is fucking annoying.
[334:12.77]Alright, let's see.
[334:15.59]Hopefully he doesn't blow up when I get up to him.
[334:27.62]Ooh, I actually didn't take damage.
[334:29.14]Good.
[334:36.42]Ah, show it.
[334:37.24]Show me your gut.
[334:41.92]Worked out.
[334:42.33]I'll just do that like fucking five more times.
[335:03.16]Easy.
[335:03.34]Easy.
[335:05.82]Okay.
[335:29.60]Shit!
[335:32.16]I didn't think he was gonna get me.
[335:40.79]Trying!
[335:42.11]I can't pronounce your name.
[335:47.19]Come on poison, stupid, get out of the way.
[335:50.91]That stuff lasts so long.
[336:00.69]Of course he does it again.
[336:05.84]See?
[336:32.26]Put that on his hand.
[336:33.24]Okay, now I'm not sure what to do.
[336:35.90]Maybe I do have to hit his hand.
[336:55.21]Oh, God.
[336:55.77]I thought he was going to swing me with the hand.
[337:01.67]Go for the knee, maybe?
[337:02.65]Or the hand?
[337:04.51]He's got one on his wrist, right?
[337:06.63]Does he?
[337:07.09]No, on his left.
[337:07.89]Achilles.
[337:20.84]Oh, yikes.
[337:26.76]There he goes.
[337:48.62]I hate this boss.
[337:50.52]I hate this boss.
[338:01.28]I can't... I don't think I can reach that.
[338:08.45]He doesn't have a sack anymore.
[338:10.93]Unfortunately.
[338:14.05]I have to get him to, like, fall so I can get that under the thigh.
[338:17.82]Right there.
[338:20.50]Got it.
[338:33.69]Ooooh.
[338:36.11]Don't you dare.
[338:37.41]He's looking to grab.
[338:38.09]He's looking for a grab.
[338:40.99]Shit.
[338:50.09]One more punch.
[338:52.96]Where is his body right now?
[338:54.58]He's in a really weird place.
[339:08.01]Where is it?
[339:09.73]Where's the last one I need to get?
[339:13.17]On the left leg.
[339:30.65]Aye, aye, aye.
[339:31.25]Oh no, he's right here too.
[339:32.99]Get him right there.
[339:33.55]Can I reach?
[339:34.35]I don't think I can reach that far.
[339:36.61]I need to have a left leg.
[339:42.03]Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me!
[340:00.22]Okay, I can hit that too.
[340:00.94]He's back.
[340:03.34]I can get him in the back.
[340:04.59]I didn't think I could reach that before.
[340:05.81]I guess I can.
[340:06.29]Time to roll.
[340:08.75]I'm gonna get up, you fucking asshole.
[340:21.80]I'm taking this super careful.
[340:33.24]Here comes the roll.
[340:33.72]I almost got crushed by the hand.
[340:43.29]Get out of my fucking town!
[340:45.43]He's not dead.
[340:47.21]Oh!
[340:49.12]Buh buh buh.
[340:50.92]Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.
[341:05.46]That boss sucked.
[341:08.12]That boss was awful.
[341:08.96]I hate that guy.
[341:16.76]Ugh, I feel like I just got struck by lightning.
[341:26.11]Hey, lookit, we did it.
[341:29.45]Hooray.
[341:32.17]It only took me seven tries.
[341:35.22]Well, I would say, like, five.
[341:37.61]Two of those tries were me saying, this is not a real try, so it wasn't a real try.
[341:41.09]It doesn't count.
[341:45.55]Honor restored.
[342:03.98]The death counter doesn't lie.
[342:05.54]Actually, hold on.
[342:10.26]Give me one second here.
[342:14.70]I want to make sure.
[342:18.02]Carlos the Clam.
[342:18.78]Let me just go into my alert box.
[342:23.32]Pop it out.
[342:33.03]Uh, right here, right?
[342:37.14]Uh, event list.
[342:41.24]Uh, maybe not.
[342:41.68]Headers, OK, dashboard.
[342:46.78]Alright, I want to make sure I say thanks to the people that subscribed during that, because I was very focused and I was not looking at anything.
[342:57.03]So, Carlos the Clam, thanks.
[342:59.43]Uruk Gash, Snouse Rifles, Street Fox TF, Major598, Jebus4, Unicorn Horde, Mr. Moobler.
[343:08.38]Victor, Foxtrot, Delta, Lobod, 287.
[343:10.86]I think I remember those couple guys.
[343:13.30]But thank you to like the four or five people I may have missed while I was intently, you know, being a psychopath.
[343:25.11]I was puked.
[343:27.89]This game is intense, man.
[343:30.65]Give me a little bit of credit.
[343:33.45]Listen to me, son.
[343:35.64]I'm your dad.
[343:37.15]Shredder from Ninja Turtles Jerry Bean, thanks a lot dude welcome Like I said before we might just be going Reaper Oh
[344:03.76]Okay, I'm going to correct myself.
[344:07.56]Let me retract a statement really quickly.
[344:13.06]I was very mad.
[344:14.86]I thought something was wrong with the game.
[344:18.61]That was not the case.
[344:21.67]This was just a different item.
[344:22.99]And I am retracting... I am telling you right now, I'm sorry.
[344:26.65]I'm sorry for getting upset that this item... I am sorry.
[344:30.59]I'm your dad!
[344:33.07]I was wrong.
[344:36.33]Oppo.
[344:37.52]Oppo 0990.
[344:38.90]Oppo?
[344:39.20]Oppo?
[344:39.46]Is that what it is?
[344:41.88]Yeah.
[344:42.16]I want to give... I was wrong.
[344:44.04]I'm corrected.
[344:45.32]I did not know this was in the game.
[344:46.76]I think this is the first time I've ever seen this in a Dark Souls game.
[344:50.45]Or a Bloodborne.
[344:51.51]So.
[344:53.15]I stand corrected.
[344:55.21]Feel free to call me a fucking idiot.
[344:56.91]Because that's what it is.
[344:59.41]I didn't read the directions.
[345:03.99]Okay, I can do two.
[345:10.03]Did I get any more Titan shards?
[345:12.77]May the flames guide you.
[345:25.67]Is this guy gonna actually speak to me again?
[345:27.79]Or is he gonna laugh at me?
[345:28.61]Hmm.
[345:44.31]Only he developed a habit of devouring men.
[345:48.39]He ate so many that he bloated like a drowned pig, then softened into sludge, and they made him a Lord of Cinder of virtue.
[346:01.94]But for might such as a lord, I suppose,
[346:07.08]Okay.
[346:07.66]Is this guy gonna tell me the entire story?
[346:09.24]Okay.
[346:09.38]Calling into question my manhood here?
[346:10.52]What are you talking about?
[346:32.31]Heavy gem.
[346:33.21]Thanks, dude.
[346:33.69]Give me more stuff.
[346:34.95]He's still going.
[347:05.57]Okay, so I have to blow out some fires or something?
[347:18.33]So my character is a Ninja Turtle in a Shredder costume.
[347:24.95]We were saying bootleg Darth Vader, but no, this is Shredder.
[347:29.23]This is a Ninja Turtle killed Shredder and took his clothes.
[347:32.81]Because they were more comfortable.
[347:40.44]Oh man, don't skip the dialog.
[347:44.26]I'm impatient.
[347:49.76]Okay, so this is a dead end, I think, right?
[347:57.56]Jerry Bean, I subscribe to say whoa.
[348:02.78]Let me just go over some of these things.
[348:05.50]I haven't picked up any new gear, I don't think.
[348:12.61]Not really.
[348:17.99]New rings.
[348:20.69]Increases fire attack, but compromises damage absorption.
[348:24.37]Not really into that at all.
[348:30.66]How many Titanite shards do I have?
[348:37.21]Two.
[348:41.15]Heavy weapon.
[348:43.87]Fire weapon.
[348:46.15]Oh, this is gonna be real cool.
[348:48.01]Listen to me, son!
[348:52.59]I'm your dad!
[348:53.43]Destroy him!
[348:58.46]Whoa!
[349:00.13]DonCad.
[349:00.82]What's going on, DonCad?
[349:02.14]Thanks for subbing.
[349:04.00]I subscribed so the Jerma would remember what my name is from.
[349:06.74]My best hat.
[349:08.44]Uh, that's like one of my favorite videos I've ever made.
[349:11.97]That game is so amazing.
[349:13.33]That is one of the best games ever.
[349:16.33]I saw your mama let you come out and play today.
[349:25.12]An old transporting kiln from Kurlan, crafted with stitched crystal lizard hide.
[349:30.82]Give to Ludlith, Lord of Cinder, to conduct soul transposition.
[349:35.65]This kiln can transpose twisted souls to craft special items with their concentrated essence deemed forbidden by those unable to make proper use of it.
[349:42.73]Okay.
[349:48.57]Uh, so.
[349:51.08]Where do I go?
[349:52.82]Where do I go?
[349:54.61]I guess I could go back the way I can.
[349:56.43]Well, okay.
[349:56.87]I can pray.
[349:57.75]We can pray.
[350:05.51]Offer vertebra shackle.
[350:07.55]I don't know what that is.
[350:10.27]Put it back in the holster.
[350:16.01]Vertebra shard or something.
[350:21.94]Just want to make sure I'm not doing something I shouldn't be doing right now.
[350:26.80]Because you know Dark Souls.
[350:30.84]You might just be fucked for the rest of the game.
[350:35.24]Whatever.
[350:36.46]Offer Vertebra Shackle.
[350:37.58]I don't even know what this is, but we're going to do it.
[350:40.52]I'm praying.
[350:42.16]Oh.
[350:43.96]Okay, I don't have the item required.
[350:45.44]So I'm going to go backwards.
[350:48.90]I think.
[350:49.42]Yeah.
[350:51.58]Yeah.
[350:53.02]Okay.
[350:55.71]This is like a cave I can go up.
[351:00.11]What's over here?
[351:00.55]I see mist.
[351:03.17]With this mist, there's fire.
[351:11.30]I guess this is just one of those rooms that is just a done deal, right?
[351:20.52]Am I fucking locked in here?
[351:21.44]I think I have to use one of the other bonfires.
[351:25.78]Didn't I come from this way?
[351:29.69]Over here?
[351:32.15]Okay, well... Gonna have to go from a different bonfire.
[351:37.79]Okey-dokey.
[351:42.92]Bye-bye.
[351:48.38]Bonfire.
[351:53.47]So the other way to go is the way I was going before, where that guy, the scary giant blue guy.
[352:01.19]The blue guy with the big scary eyes and the frost sword, I think is where I need to be heading, which is over here.
[352:09.43]No, no, no, no, no, no, it's not.
[352:10.53]It's over this way.
[352:18.45]Now we can slow down.
[352:20.53]I can actually kill the rats.
[352:26.41]Yeah, baseball swing really is not good.
[352:35.77]I just did it and it didn't really do anything.
[352:39.39]Unless you have to legit hit them directly in their face.
[352:45.59]I can't really see a reason why you should ever use it.
[352:54.11]I don't know how you'd ever one-hand a side like this.
[352:58.97]This is still locked?
[353:05.28]Yeah.
[353:12.21]Need something?
[353:12.83]Am I gonna pull an all-nighter?
[353:17.75]I don't know.
[353:19.21]I mean, I'm enjoying the game.
[353:21.39]And I've been really excited.
[353:22.35]I've been waiting for this game for a long time, so I don't know.
[353:25.21]What time is it?
[353:26.31]I don't even know what time it is.
[353:30.07]I would like everyone to hold on a second.
[353:33.99]I would just like everyone to hold on a second.
[353:38.51]Is it because... It is, isn't it?
[353:43.67]So, you're noticing that there's not, like, just, like, five or six enemies stuffed right where that rock is?
[353:51.22]So, they all... I'm beating the spawn timer because they're supposed to be over there.
[353:58.06]Those enemies that all stack in here and, like, walk into each other and they're all, like, that mess that is here every time, they're not here because they're not supposed to be here.
[354:06.37]They're supposed to be, like, down there and, like, up and around the corner.
[354:10.67]So, I'm beating their spawn time.
[354:14.16]What a pain in the ass.
[354:28.35]Don't you do it.
[354:30.95]Yeah, that thing is not good.
[354:42.91]Please attack.
[354:43.67]Please do your move.
[354:44.81]Might as well just look up here.
[354:51.10]I don't think I got everything.
[354:52.74]Is there a place I can break this door down?
[354:56.20]Behind the tree.
[354:59.96]There's a dog.
[355:00.62]Here are the two dogs!
[355:04.34]Hmm.
[355:05.60]Hmm!
[355:07.72]Isn't that interesting?
[355:09.84]Here are the dogs.
[355:12.28]That were chasing me the whole time, every time I'm running back.
[355:17.03]Can you believe it?
[355:17.91]And look it, they're supposed to be protecting this item.
[355:22.29]Now, if I'm a betting man... I'm fucking kidding.
[355:33.78]Okay.
[355:38.66]But do you see what I'm saying?
[355:41.20]Those are the dogs that were chasing me.
[355:43.90]And they're supposed to be over there protecting a treasure, guarding that alluring skull.
[355:49.67]I knew I was mad for a reason.
[355:54.31]Everybody was making fun of me.
[355:56.91]They're saying, no, you're just an idiot.
[356:01.60]And I am.
[356:02.52]I am an idiot.
[356:03.58]I know this.
[356:05.62]But a broken clock is right twice a day.
[356:08.08]Sometimes I'm right.
[356:09.48]And that time I was right.
[356:16.47]See what I'm talking about?
[356:17.61]These dogs.
[356:19.55]I went too fast.
[356:22.49]I went too fast.
[356:23.05]Hold on a second.
[356:27.79]I need to say something.
[356:29.15]I gotta prove something to myself.
[356:32.88]If there are two dogs here, then there's no problem at all.
[356:36.26]And I'm just going to stay quiet.
[356:38.18]If there are not two dogs here... There are two dogs here.
[356:43.37]Hey, Zeus!
[356:43.73]0-2-3!
[356:45.85]What's happening?
[356:57.39]That dog just dropped from the sky.
[357:00.97]He just dropped from the fucking sky.
[357:04.75]You guys aren't supposed to be here.
[357:13.14]This is not fair.
[357:14.92]Just because I didn't fight the rats doesn't mean you can spawn everybody on a bridge.
[357:18.46]Get out of here.
[357:21.90]Out of my way.
[357:38.36]I kind of just want to die.
[357:39.72]Yeah, just kill me.
[357:41.10]There's no point.
[357:43.42]Now you can't even hurt me.
[357:44.32]You guys can't hit me now?
[357:48.24]So here's what I'm going to do.
[357:49.06]I'm going to fight the rats.
[357:51.06]So the game is... The engine loads the enemies where they're supposed to be.
[357:54.36]That's what I'm going to do.
[357:57.19]I'm gonna kill the rats, so in the time that I render into the engine the next wave of enemies that all start on the bridge together in a clump, everything's gonna be fine.
[358:07.69]They won't be there.
[358:09.17]They'll be where they're supposed to be on the other side of the map.
[358:14.68]How did I not hit them?
[358:25.83]And swing.
[358:37.81]Okay.
[358:39.67]Now, with a wave of my hand at an abracadabra, there will not be that mess up here.
[358:46.28]They're all going to be where they're supposed to be.
[358:51.94]Except, no, this dog is supposed to be here.
[358:53.72]This dog is supposed to be here.
[358:56.36]You'll see.
[358:56.78]Ready?
[359:00.62]Now, the dogs in this game are just as annoying as the dogs in Bloodborne.
[359:03.92]And by annoying, I mean super annoying.
[359:07.90]Okay.
[359:09.64]Alright, so what's on the bridge?
[359:12.66]Hmm.
[359:13.78]Interesting.
[359:15.76]There's nobody here.
[359:19.61]Would you look at that?
[359:22.83]She, like, walked over there.
[359:24.09]They, like, they walked to where they're supposed to be.
[359:27.45]Unbelievable.
[359:34.62]Shit.
[359:51.65]At least I know there's a bug down there.
[360:00.45]I'm starting to really not like this area.
[360:03.66]Tree guy.
[360:05.68]Fucking tree guy.
[360:06.52]And now this.
[360:19.51]I think I'm gonna take an Ember.
[360:20.49]I think that'll help.
[360:32.08]Let's take an Ember.
[360:35.70]Mmm!
[360:37.81]Delicious.
[360:41.93]So this is the new humanity, is what I'm, I guess, understanding.
[360:56.85]Okay, the scythe is so long to swing at these.
[361:00.51]I'm going to stop complaining.
[361:01.69]I'm going to shut the hell up.
[361:04.36]Because I'm being like, dogs are so hard.
[361:07.24]The scythe is not good.
[361:08.56]These enemies aren't supposed to be here.
[361:10.08]I'm turning into a real whiner right now.
[361:19.12]It's dumb.
[361:19.82]I don't like this.
[361:20.46]I don't like that.
[361:21.42]I'm not a fan of this.
[361:22.18]You know, I'm not a big fan of this.
[361:23.16]Can I tell you?
[361:23.56]I'm not a big fan of this.
[361:24.76]Can I tell you guys something?
[361:25.38]I'm not a fan of how the thing swings.
[361:27.70]Just play the game, dude.
[361:42.51]I'm just going to run by these guys.
[361:43.47]I don't need to fight them.
[361:47.06]Mining is a good video game fodder.
[361:55.95]What is down here?
[361:58.49]I didn't even go... I hope those guys don't follow me.
[362:01.41]Because this is a... Oh no!
[362:06.45]That's not a place I want to be locked in with this dude.
[362:15.76]We're here to hear you complain.
[362:16.94]And just like that, I've made my way.
[362:23.26]Wait a minute.
[362:25.33]I don't have to go this way.
[362:26.45]Where do I go?
[362:30.11]Because this is the giants up here, right?
[362:36.81]Okay.
[362:40.95]Maybe I could go down?
[362:44.64]Do I have to go back to the other shrine?
[362:48.32]Not the shrine.
[362:51.63]I guess I don't know.
[362:52.27]I guess I'm going to go... It's going to be really, really horrible as if those two big guys are standing right here.
[363:01.59]That would be very, very bad.
[363:03.55]Because what was down here?
[363:12.02]I don't remember.
[363:17.72]I just... My memory can't piece together what's actually here.
[363:26.01]I guess I kind of remember this.
[363:29.25]This is where... Oh, there.
[363:31.35]Okay.
[363:32.43]This is the... This is the really scary enemy.
[363:35.96]The guy that I really don't want to fight.
[363:39.10]But sometimes you gotta fight strong enemies.
[363:42.06]This is Dark Souls.
[363:45.94]I shouldn't have clicked on the I did it yet, because I didn't do it.
[363:47.92]Okay, pillar is your friend.
[363:53.60]I gotta remember that.
[363:54.40]Ooh, don't wanna get frostbitten.
[364:08.83]He's so fast.
[364:16.74]Shit.
[364:20.62]Shit.
[364:21.28]My God, give me a second, man.
[364:50.75]You're still alive?
[364:51.97]Yikes.
[364:54.00]How on Earth did you stay alive that long?
[364:56.28]That is a new sword.
[364:57.12]Phew.
[365:08.90]D&D.
[365:10.86]What's the ability?
[365:12.88]Oh, shit.
[365:13.90]While in stance, use normal attack to break a foe's guard from below.
[365:22.76]Looks okay.
[365:25.92]Just want to take a look at it.
[365:27.66]Just curious.
[365:28.82]Wow, that's a cool looking sword.
[365:30.38]It's like a Frostmourne.
[365:36.11]It's nice and fast, too.
[365:40.43]It's got a good charge.
[365:43.65]Here's the... Listen to me, son!
[365:52.04]It's kind of cool.
[366:03.07]Kind of cool.
[366:08.08]Maybe in a different world I would use it.
[366:09.98]Not right now.
[366:14.74]You subscribe so you can post a funny reason for subscribing?
[366:17.70]I'm your dad!
[366:20.13]Destroy him!
[366:23.69]Road of Sacrifices.
[366:24.65]Blood Slurp!
[366:26.09]Thanks a lot, dude.
[366:31.76]Um... I don't think I can even level up, so... I don't see a reason to go back.
[366:47.17]Praise the sun!
[366:52.81]That guy looks real unstable.
[366:56.17]He almost seems like he's unsure if he should be, like, holding the sword.
[367:00.62]Okay, I was trained.
[367:02.40]I was told that he was gonna come down here.
[367:04.04]I missed him.
[367:05.78]I'm not sure if I'm gonna hit him when I'm doing this.
[367:09.09]He might be a little too far away.
[367:14.85]And now he's a bird.
[367:23.38]This guy's fucking nuts.
[367:25.20]This guy's crazy.
[367:26.00]This guy's terrifying.
[367:34.07]I was making fun of this guy and I shouldn't have been.
[367:40.03]Yikes.
[367:40.27]Let's take a left.
[367:53.93]Okay.
[368:05.61]No reason, huh?
[368:06.51]Is that in here?
[368:07.03]There's got to be, like, a reason for these.
[368:09.65]Ooh, look.
[368:14.45]What do you got down there?
[368:15.41]I make sure if I drop down I'm not going to miss anything else.
[368:18.67]Which it does not look like it.
[368:20.53]So, I will drop down and I will sever this guy's head from his body.
[368:31.84]Done.
[368:35.40]Shriving stone?
[368:36.62]What does that do?
[368:41.95]Ugh.
[368:45.67]Undo weapon infusion.
[368:47.23]Alright, so it's a kind of a reset.
[368:49.95]Cool.
[368:50.09]How does it feel to be turning 40?
[368:55.28]Every inch of my body hurts.
[368:57.76]Always.
[368:58.10]Ah, the life of a 40-year-old man.
[369:00.98]I'm surprised nobody jumped out of this thing to try to kill me.
[369:09.57]Surprising.
[369:15.47]I'm going to check every single nook and cranny.
[369:17.65]I figured I could try the jump.
[369:22.19]It would be fun.
[369:24.17]Let's go.
[369:28.42]Left or right?
[369:29.68]Left.
[369:29.88]Jeez.
[369:43.20]You...
[369:45.61]These guys move so fast.
[369:46.71]It's hard to even.
[369:48.27]It's hard to even.
[369:48.89]You know what I mean.
[369:50.57]That's a weird looking tree.
[370:04.23]That's a dead fall.
[370:08.17]Everything down there is death.
[370:14.81]So what was the purpose of coming over here?
[370:17.18]This wasn't just for the view.
[370:18.22]Maybe it was.
[370:49.50]I thought I hit him before he hit me.
[370:51.28]That's not cool.
[371:01.03]He's freaking screaming right now.
[371:09.07]Was that him screaming?
[371:11.47]Oh, no.
[371:11.97]Is that another one?
[371:13.03]That's two more, isn't it?
[371:15.19]No.
[371:15.65]I thought he was... What the fuck is going on?
[371:27.20]What is happening?
[371:27.78]He's bouncing up corpses into the air!
[371:34.54]Yeah, there are two here.
[371:35.80]Of course.
[371:37.24]Uh, who played Bloodborne?
[371:39.26]These are just blood-starved beasts.
[371:42.68]Jesus!
[371:45.94]Rest, rest, rest, rest, rest.
[371:50.56]Some of the enemies in this game are like mini Bloodborne bosses.
[371:57.77]Just like the crazy, like jumpy, spammy enemies.
[372:05.25]Unpredictable.
[372:11.87]The strategy with these guys, I think, is you just have to stay on them.
[372:14.56]Just combo the hell out of them before they can even get their wings out.
[372:18.32]When the wings come out, that's when... When the gloves come off, that's when shit hits the fan.
[372:24.35]In a sense.
[372:24.85]Come on.
[372:42.32]Wow, another one behind me.
[372:46.40]Goodness, goodness.
[372:48.62]This is like the shaman, the one that screams.
[372:59.05]Um, let's go, leap of faith.
[373:01.19]What are they?
[373:11.16]Yikes.
[373:16.27]The Wicked Witch of the West called in her flight monkeys.
[373:18.93]At least they're coming in one by one at the moment.
[373:24.91]No, no, I spoke way too soon.
[373:42.08]That was not cool.
[373:48.81]Is that another player?
[373:54.27]No.
[373:55.24]Who is this guy?
[373:55.84]He's freaking me out.
[373:56.42]This is Tin Man.
[374:00.74]While we stay on our references for Wizard of Oz, I'm fighting the Tin Man now.
[374:10.61]I didn't hit him, apparently.
[374:24.93]I thought he was going to light his thing on fire.
[374:29.77]Jesus.
[374:32.04]I should have dodged first.
[374:35.32]Last ditch effort here.
[374:37.16]See if I can parry him.
[374:40.00]No, that's not a parryable move.
[374:46.26]I feel like that should have been it.
[374:49.18]I feel like I could have got it with that too.
[374:51.70]Fucking Wizard of Oz enemies.
[375:05.92]Hmm.
[375:07.62]I hope I'm in the right area.
[375:08.56]I hope I'm not in an area that I'm not supposed to be in.
[375:12.34]Because these guys are taking a long time to kill and they're extremely dangerous.
[375:16.81]I feel like I should be in this place, though.
[375:18.43]I feel like I should, but I feel like I shouldn't at the same time.
[375:21.29]I hate that I have to fight all these guys because they just fly to wherever you are.
[375:58.14]They were not fucking around when they made this game.
[376:02.12]Of all the observations of playing Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborne
[376:08.45]some of these enemies are fucking insane insane I guess I don't remember that many enemies in like any of the souls games being this ridiculous just totally ridiculous and I don't mean like oh it's like difficulty I'm talking about just like fucking total lunacy
[376:34.62]These guys go absolutely batshit crazy when you fight them.
[376:39.48]They, like, scream.
[376:40.44]They fly around.
[376:41.13]They swing, like, violently in every fucking direction.
[376:43.33]These guys are nuts.
[376:54.19]They were not... They were not kidding when they made this area.
[376:58.79]Fighting two of these guys at the same time is like going to the dentist and having teeth extracted.
[377:10.40]I'm gonna throw a knife at one of them.
[377:13.28]Because this is just total fucking lunacy.
[377:17.32]Can I just pull one of you assholes?
[377:19.40]Of course not.
[377:21.00]Oh, wait.
[377:21.48]Did it work?
[377:24.21]I'm not sure.
[377:26.55]One of them looks like he's engaging.
[377:28.11]The other one kind of doesn't care.
[377:38.12]Come on.
[377:40.52]Okay, well it pissed him off.
[377:43.14]Hopefully it didn't piss his friend off either.
[377:52.15]Let me just double kick you.
[377:53.97]Oh lord.
[377:59.19]Why do I have my bow out?
[378:01.03]Where did the bow come from?
[378:02.37]I'm blaming it on the kick.
[378:08.33]If I didn't kick him two times in a row because I hit up on my controller.
[378:13.44]I'm just complaining again.
[378:14.30]We're just complaining, but let me... I need to find the way to unbind that before I put my hand through my screen.
[378:27.63]Tilt camera.
[378:32.51]Attack, attack, interact.
[378:35.70]I don't think you can get rid of it.
[378:40.30]I think it's possible to remove that feature from the game.
[378:48.30]Attack.
[378:50.88]Right hand.
[378:51.54]Strong attack.
[378:52.10]Attack left.
[378:54.48]Interact.
[378:54.98]A two-handed weapon.
[379:07.51]Huh.
[379:09.97]Uh, auto-target, auto, no, manual attack aiming.
[379:15.91]I don't know.
[379:22.94]Is that... I don't like it.
[379:25.24]I don't like it.
[379:28.15]I'd rather not do it at all than have to do it, like, accidentally all the time.
[379:44.05]This guy's different.
[379:44.79]This guy's like a shaman.
[379:56.50]I've got to get rid of this guy quick because another one comes out.
[380:03.52]Where's the other one?
[380:05.06]Where's your friend?
[380:05.88]I know he comes out of the same hole.
[380:07.32]I think the same cave.
[380:09.60]I think.
[380:12.59]Do I like the art direction?
[380:14.67]Yeah.
[380:15.61]I mean, Bloodborne was just like a 10 out of 10 for me.
[380:20.91]Like 100%.
[380:21.83]Not even, not 99, not 98, like 100% on how that game felt, like atmosphere-wise.
[380:29.28]I don't know.
[380:30.82]Maybe I'm a sucker for Lovecraftian stuff, but it was really cool.
[380:37.14]Who's next?
[380:37.74]Who's here?
[380:43.10]I'm gonna get trapped by somebody.
[380:45.60]Oh, no, no, no.
[380:47.00]Okay, it's the Tin Man.
[380:49.08]As long as I can fight the Tin Man one-on-one, I might be able just to beat him.
[380:53.45]Alright, Tin Man, I'm ready for you.
[380:55.81]I think.
[380:59.35]I'm gonna try to slash Tin Man's throat with the baseball swing.
[381:04.27]Cue it up!
[381:06.42]Ooh, you got baseball swung.
[381:10.22]That actually was kind of good.
[381:14.05]I didn't hit him with it?
[381:14.83]Come on!
[381:16.21]Come on.
[381:16.93]I'm gonna full heal here.
[381:42.24]Go find Dorothy.
[381:51.30]He's rolling in the same direction as me.
[381:53.04]That's the worst!
[381:57.15]Get out of my face, please.
[382:01.91]Give me whatever you're holding.
[382:02.89]The butcher's knife.
[382:03.61]Okay, I got his weapon.
[382:08.99]Kids these days call everything Lovecraftian because it sounds cool.
[382:12.93]I mean, that may be true, but did you play Bloodborne?
[382:16.84]Without spoiling anything, it's pretty accurate, I'd say.
[382:22.90]That's a weapon.
[382:27.38]An A for scaling.
[382:31.69]Damn, that's awesome.
[382:36.17]That is really awesome.
[382:44.30]Better art style?
[382:44.90]You just can't compete with Bloodborne.
[382:48.76]In my opinion.
[382:51.77]I love that game too much.
[382:52.51]Alright.
[382:56.05]Let me get some new gear.
[383:04.17]Hmm.
[383:08.70]Why is it always the dinky helmet that you find in the beginning of the game that lasts for so long?
[383:17.79]Just see what I look like with these on.
[383:22.51]So it's still better.
[383:24.88]I mean, poison, frost, curse.
[383:27.88]If I need to put it on, I will.
[383:31.00]So these are better.
[383:36.65]So are these.
[383:42.14]Somehow I look even worse.
[383:44.50]Not sure how.
[383:53.74]Oh, twin daggers.
[383:56.98]Where are they?
[384:00.49]A D in scaling for dexterity?
[384:06.41]Really?
[384:06.73]I feel like that's...
[384:13.15]These are so cool, but they scale terribly.
[384:19.63]The critical hit, is that why it's so good?
[384:21.41]Because it just does way more damage with a backstab or visceral?
[384:24.76]I don't know.
[384:31.02]But let's continue.
[384:37.27]Those are sweet, though.
[384:46.45]Into the next area.
[384:48.15]Into the next place.
[384:55.59]We'll go that way or this way.
[385:01.98]We'll go this way.
[385:26.86]Please God I can't roll anywhere for that specific reason It's like do you guys have a Choking on my own words right now.
[385:45.89]Do they have a stamina bar?
[385:47.71]I
[385:50.12]A lot of enemies in this game seem to just be able to swing endlessly.
[385:56.55]Without any wherewithal.
[385:59.19]Or anything else.
[386:00.39]Was I just spamming a bill- Oh, no.
[386:02.67]More of these fucking... Shit, there's more of them.
[386:14.10]I'm gonna go to a different zone.
[386:18.17]Oh dear god.
[386:19.95]Is there like a bonfire over here?
[386:21.55]He fell off, so I'm okay.
[386:24.65]Let me just see if there's a bonfire.
[386:27.08]Because this is getting out of hand.
[386:29.76]There it is.
[386:32.98]Can he make it?
[386:33.84]Can he make it?
[386:34.52]Can he make it?
[386:35.30]The marathon.
[386:37.66]He made it.
[386:39.70]Hooray.
[386:45.74]He looks nice.
[386:47.44]Oh, hello.
[386:48.60]How do you do?
[386:49.18]I am Anri of Astora, unkindled like you.
[386:55.63]This is Horace, a friend and traveling companion.
[386:58.75]This guy's not looking at my morning farts.
[387:04.02]You get really squeaky farts, dude.
[387:06.40]Below us is the Crucifixion Woods.
[387:09.20]Beyond the Crucifixion Woods lies Farron Keep, home of the Undead Legion.
[387:14.26]Further yet is the Cathedral of the Deep.
[387:17.37]I think that's where I'm supposed to be going.
[387:18.53]Where's the guy that swore his life to me?
[387:22.51]Okay.
[387:22.67]I believe that's Horace.
[387:43.43]He's an upstanding man.
[387:45.37]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[387:49.53]Without his help, I would have cursed this owner.
[387:55.10]We are well along the Road of Sacrifices.
[387:58.12]Below us is the crucifixion woods.
[388:01.31]Beyond the flooded woods lies Farron Keep.
[388:04.39]Home of the undead legion.
[388:06.59]Further yet is the Cathedral of the Deep.
[388:08.73]We may go our separate way the next time we cross paths.
[388:12.19]Is that all you're going to say?
[388:13.89]Beyond the flooded woods lies Farron Keep.
[388:17.09]Looks like there's two ways I can go now.
[388:19.23]This guy doesn't say anything.
[388:23.65]Oh, it's a covenant.
[388:29.40]Thanks for telling me about your covenant.
[388:32.40]I'm sure it's a good one.
[388:38.28]Ooh.
[388:39.34]Cool castle in the distance.
[388:41.68]Cool bridge.
[388:43.46]Oh, is that that castle?
[388:44.68]That's the castle I was looking down and saying, well, the dragon crashed.
[388:47.66]Five hours ago.
[388:52.92]Hey, time flies.
[388:53.56]Yeah, with a big stick.
[389:03.83]Dude's just walking around with a tree trunk.
[389:15.83]I think I might need to upgrade this weapon.
[389:17.55]I missed.
[389:29.41]You're a little too long for me.
[389:30.62]I'm gonna have to just kill you normally.
[389:41.86]Get some woods.
[389:43.30]A wooded area.
[390:02.28]I feel like these guys would be pretty easy to backstab, right?
[390:04.62]I'm trying to backstab him.
[390:31.33]Oh, I didn't get around you.
[390:32.55]That's too bad.
[390:46.30]That thing does such dinky damage.
[390:49.22]Backstab is kind of cool, but it does pretty dink for damage.
[390:59.81]Am I getting tired?
[391:00.43]Yeah, a little bit.
[391:02.52]I'm gonna go for a little bit longer, though.
[391:04.76]I might get to the next boss.
[391:05.66]I'm not sure if I'll beat the... Was it the fourth boss now?
[391:09.34]But maybe I'll get to him if I'm going the right direction.
[391:12.09]I'm hearing all kinds of noises.
[391:23.42]Oh, hold on, guys.
[391:23.98]Take a picture.
[391:25.14]Take a picture.
[391:26.78]Is this a Dark Souls game?
[391:28.72]There better be a swamp that's all green.
[391:32.78]Here it is.
[391:34.92]Here's the green swamp that's in every single one of these games.
[391:39.18]Big dog.
[391:40.52]Listen to me, son.
[391:42.74]I'm your dad.
[391:45.43]Destroy him!
[391:48.89]Whoa!
[391:49.81]Red Easter.
[391:52.05]Thanks a lot.
[391:52.43]Welcome.
[391:55.53]Listen to me, son.
[391:58.07]I'm your dad.
[392:00.47]Destroy him!
[392:04.23]Get that log out of my face.
[392:08.39]I know who you are.
[392:12.00]I've seen you before.
[392:13.76]In real life.
[392:16.90]We've met before.
[392:18.04]You just subscribed.
[392:18.76]Hi.
[392:19.58]I think I met you at like PAX.
[392:22.99]Like PAX Prime or something.
[392:24.37]Like four years ago.
[392:26.81]Hey, welcome to the shit-eating, piss-drinking, jock-shocking shit-stains.
[392:37.63]Uh... I don't even... Crabs?
[392:40.03]We're doing crabs now?
[392:42.67]That's a giant crab.
[392:43.63]That's a giant enemy crab.
[392:46.77]I gotta hit his weak point for massive damage.
[392:51.13]You guys remember that one?
[392:53.17]But really, though, giant enemy crab.
[392:54.49]I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do here.
[392:57.91]I gotta hit him right in his, like, fucking... I don't know what that is.
[393:04.62]I gotta hit him in his, uh... In his tamale.
[393:09.81]First give her this little baby crab.
[393:11.89]How many times are you gonna swing?
[393:21.66]How many times are you gonna swing?
[393:24.06]I was waiting for one or two.
[393:28.94]Can I get behind you?
[393:36.75]Can I kick him over or something?
[393:44.18]Eat this!
[393:44.54]Didn't work.
[393:52.69]There he goes with his 500 attacks again.
[393:59.99]Um, what about this one?
[394:20.03]Alright, guys.
[394:21.70]We're getting... We're having crab tonight.
[394:33.31]I can't hit his weak point.
[394:34.43]That's what I'm supposed to be doing.
[394:36.65]It's not letting me.
[394:41.41]It's not good enough.
[394:46.76]Oh, fuck.
[394:49.59]Don't blow this one.
[394:50.51]Come on.
[394:51.13]Just be patient.
[394:54.93]Be patient with the giant crab.
[394:59.58]Break his arm.
[395:01.62]Shit.
[395:01.96]A fucking guy with a tree.
[395:04.06]Where did he come?
[395:12.62]Was that guy lying down on the ground?
[395:16.23]I feel like that guy was lying down.
[395:19.13]Ugh.
[395:20.55]Come on.
[395:21.13]Maybe I should just try to sneak underneath them and stab them.
[395:34.26]Because I have to be able to hit them in that spot, right?
[395:37.22]Let's just skip these guys.
[395:38.80]Fuck these guys.
[395:42.14]Stuff those tree trunks up your ass.
[395:47.58]I want to kill that massive crab.
[395:48.78]It definitely drops like a crab carapace.
[395:52.98]What the hell?
[395:54.24]What the hell?
[395:54.90]You're the guys from Dark Souls 2.
[395:56.16]You do the weapon and... No.
[396:02.12]I can't speak.
[396:02.77]We're not talking right now.
[396:03.95]We're just going to make sure I don't lose all my durability.
[396:07.31]I'm poisoned.
[396:09.55]These guys don't do durability.
[396:10.55]They do poison.
[396:15.75]I want the crab.
[396:16.43]I don't want either one of you guys.
[396:17.41]It says I'm poisoned, but I'm not taking any damage at all.
[396:22.68]Slowly, maybe?
[396:23.62]I guess, yeah.
[396:26.50]Where's that crab?
[396:29.42]I hear him.
[396:29.90]I hear him.
[396:32.48]Where's he hiding?
[396:33.28]Over there?
[396:33.62]There he is.
[396:37.46]Yeah, I am getting, like, real tired.
[396:39.06]It's hard to speak.
[396:43.09]It's way past my bedtime, but I'm like, I want to play Dark Souls 3, you know?
[396:55.02]Although playing games like this tired is usually not the brightest idea.
[397:07.40]Both of you have such low HP.
[397:09.66]Surprised you took it that far.
[397:16.01]Okay, there's the crab.
[397:21.13]He's making his way over.
[397:22.07]How did I not see him before?
[397:25.19]You're gonna get stabbed with my crab claw!
[397:31.13]That's not working.
[397:34.93]That's not working at all.
[397:36.71]I have to just be slow.
[397:37.61]Don't walk into the dog.
[397:38.75]You know, I think it might be time to make a run.
[397:40.63]There's another giant crab.
[397:43.27]There's more than one.
[397:45.99]There's two giant crabs.
[397:47.05]Oh, shit.
[397:50.43]I don't know what I'm supposed to do about this.
[397:56.98]I think this strategy is just wrong.
[398:03.28]Ooh, that might make me look like the Grim Reaper, I think.
[398:08.50]See, the crabs can't come out of the water.
[398:13.39]I'm not fighting crabs right now.
[398:19.68]Dark Souls 3 is an action game based on actual Japanese history.
[398:24.02]So here's this giant enemy crab.
[398:25.80]Alright, we got our, like, 2001 internet meme out of the way.
[398:34.07]Or, like, no, 2005.
[398:34.67]How do I get this?
[398:39.27]Drop down from... Try jumping?
[398:43.21]Really?
[398:45.96]Am I getting, uh...
[398:48.96]Am I getting my bone pulled here?
[398:52.08]Can I actually make that?
[398:52.90]I don't think I can do it.
[399:02.26]Unless I go from... Give it one more shot.
[399:06.97]And then I'll accept the fact that I was lied to.
[399:11.87]No.
[399:12.85]Yeah, I got my bone pulled.
[399:15.95]It's a new enemy.
[399:18.07]Although, there was another item over here, I think.
[399:25.73]Yeah, there is.
[399:26.37]I want to get it.
[399:32.10]Something nice to the elderly.
[399:33.18]We just love human contact.
[399:35.44]Yeah, Sark, I've seen videos of you from recent times.
[399:40.48]You do not look like an old man.
[399:42.42]By any means.
[399:44.68]You like... Hold on.
[399:46.08]There's a guy rocking out at me.
[399:48.11]I gotta run away.
[399:51.93]Oh, what's that?
[399:54.15]What's that?
[399:54.55]You can't get up here?
[399:56.20]Oh, that's too bad.
[399:58.55]Yeah, I'm on land, you sea cretin.
[400:01.95]Oh, is that your baby?
[400:03.45]Is that your baby?
[400:05.87]Oh, what happened?
[400:07.19]What happened?
[400:09.46]I'll tell you, you did it to my son.
[400:10.94]That was my son, you fucking asshole.
[400:13.40]Oh, why am I such a big crab?
[400:14.96]I can't get up no stairs.
[400:19.00]That did a lot of damage.
[400:26.59]Come on.
[400:27.31]Why do I have to be so big?
[400:40.56]Where did he go?
[400:42.32]Where did you go?
[400:42.96]I didn't know he could do that.
[400:49.31]Where is he?
[400:55.81]Is that him over there?
[400:56.61]Or is that his, like, brother?
[400:57.51]I have no idea.
[401:03.54]I'm just... I'm gone now.
[401:07.52]What do you else in here?
[401:15.55]He... Yeah, he just kind of... Didn't really care anymore.
[401:18.97]Took off.
[401:19.15]Crystal bug!
[401:20.35]Crystal bug!
[401:24.68]Nice.
[401:25.42]What is it?
[401:26.20]Crystal gem.
[401:28.19]I don't know what that is, but nice.
[401:29.39]Uh-oh.
[401:35.91]Okay.
[401:38.23]Okay.
[401:40.14]Easy.
[401:46.62]Easy now.
[401:48.54]One of you come down the stairs.
[401:50.84]Get knifed.
[402:02.21]Good thing I was mildly annoying to that guy.
[402:06.26]Get down here.
[402:08.92]Use the stairs.
[402:11.58]Use the stairs.
[402:12.16]They're in front of you.
[402:12.88]Yep, you almost got it.
[402:15.18]Almost here.
[402:18.52]Yeah, you walk down them.
[402:22.06]I know your legs might be bad from like 200 years of not doing anything and not moving because you're a skeleton.
[402:28.09]But you're gonna come to... Thank you.
[402:29.65]Come and fight me.
[402:33.70]Slowly but surely, you're going to make your way in here.
[402:35.28]Come on.
[402:37.14]Come on.
[402:38.82]We can get in here.
[402:43.46]That was such a perfect shot that he just did.
[402:46.57]And now I'm in deep shit.
[402:47.51]I think there's more than one shooting.
[402:53.01]Oh, he's coming down.
[403:02.34]I might just get out of here.
[403:04.50]But they're mocking me at this point.
[403:06.03]I can't let that happen.
[403:06.91]Did this guy get his health back?
[403:11.61]This is a different person.
[403:21.07]Of course you're going to drink.
[403:29.26]Boy.
[403:29.82]Okay.
[403:31.60]Okay.
[403:33.10]Now, I'm gonna bum rush this guy.
[403:42.87]He's got way more health than I thought the mage guy was gonna have.
[403:45.53]Alright, what were you protecting up here?
[403:49.96]What secrets are up here that you were guarding?
[403:55.90]Uh...
[404:05.77]Nothing up here?
[404:06.51]I can drop down here.
[404:11.68]Secret wall, come on.
[404:15.76]I can see through it, though.
[404:19.22]That's why I came over here.
[404:20.48]Ring of Sacrifice.
[404:21.38]Let's take a look-see.
[404:28.85]Lose nothing upon death, but the ring breaks.
[404:30.99]Hmm.
[404:35.31]Don't necessarily care about that at the moment.
[404:37.07]There's something else over here.
[404:46.59]I don't know.
[404:48.33]Down here.
[404:51.89]I hear noise.
[404:54.74]Keep your guard up.
[404:57.54]Slowly.
[404:59.48]Easy.
[405:01.80]Easy.
[405:02.20]Nobody to the left or the right.
[405:04.95]I just said left or right?
[405:06.03]Backwards?
[405:07.01]Do I know my left or right?
[405:14.60]It's pretty clutch blocking.
[405:15.88]Okay, one.
[405:26.69]And then the other.
[405:34.84]This is so dangerous.
[405:41.04]My whole body hurts right now.
[405:44.24]I did not expect this guy.
[405:46.42]I seriously, a year of my life just was removed from me.
[405:50.20]If I'm gonna live to be 78, I'm 77 now.
[405:51.52]I'm gonna die when I'm 77.
[405:52.90]I should just homeward bone.
[406:00.61]I really should.
[406:01.15]I feel like I'm close to something.
[406:10.55]There's the guy with the soul knives.
[406:12.35]There's three people in this room.
[406:15.45]Bye-bye.
[406:22.16]One, two, three.
[406:27.36]Let's go.
[406:30.70]It did not come from that direction.
[406:32.59]I promise you it came from over here.
[406:34.57]No, he didn't throw it at you.
[406:35.77]I did.
[406:46.01]It might be time to bone on out of here.
[406:48.23]Those are homing.
[406:49.59]I just realized that right now.
[407:02.47]See you later.
[407:09.17]He's eating me!
[407:13.06]He's eating me!
[407:19.58]At least I got the ring.
[407:20.38]I got the ring.
[407:23.36]I figured we could drop down.
[407:24.54]I didn't know there was going to be a big guy with a cross on his back.
[407:29.56]Shorten spellcasting time.
[407:30.84]Whoop-de-doo.
[407:31.32]Good thing I need that.
[407:35.93]Something tells me I don't need to go that way, but I'm going to anyways.
[407:50.56]Let me kick him.
[407:51.82]You gotta make sure to kick him.
[407:53.35]Waste some of your stamina accidentally kicking him.
[407:55.33]Come on.
[408:04.18]Hey guys, I have another Titanite charge.
[408:05.88]Back to bed.
[408:07.66]I'm gonna upgrade the scythe again.
[408:15.04]So now I'll be a little bit more beefy.
[408:25.53]Have I really been streaming for like six hours?
[408:26.99]I don't think I have enough souls.
[408:35.83]Do I have?
[408:36.35]No, I have one of those.
[408:36.97]Yeah, I do.
[408:39.14]I'll use one of these ones.
[408:46.48]I've been going for six hours.
[408:48.04]Interesting.
[408:48.44]I still have to finish a video.
[408:50.14]I have a video like half done, but then Dark Souls 3 came out.
[409:02.45]Great scythe.
[409:13.53]Just curious again.
[409:14.43]49, yeah.
[409:21.41]Eh.
[409:23.86]Chug some Nyquil?
[409:24.82]Why would I want to do that?
[409:32.27]How much do I need?
[409:33.37]42.
[409:37.08]No, that's the wrong button!
[409:51.29]Hold on, somebody subscribed.
[409:52.89]Mate?
[409:54.09]MatoPotato2.
[409:55.11]Man, if I killed her, I would have to reset the game.
[410:02.33]I was trying... What was I trying to do, by the way?
[410:07.92]Only one thing can happen by hitting right bumper.
[410:11.40]And that's hit person with sword or axe.
[410:15.02]What was I trying to do?
[410:16.38]What button was I trying to press besides A?
[410:18.44]I think the tired is catching up to me a little, huh?
[410:28.29]Can I get to 42 just by...
[410:34.15]Sullivan.
[410:34.57]I don't think I can.
[410:35.11]I could break this.
[410:37.35]Eh, smash this thing.
[410:38.19]I don't want this.
[410:39.51]Smash it.
[410:43.01]Now I definitely can get to 42.
[410:43.95]38.
[410:44.07]Okie dokie.
[410:47.63]So something I'm noticing...
[411:04.61]In Bloodborne, when you leveled up anything, your physical defense also was leveled up, no matter what point you put into anything.
[411:14.93]Dexterity doesn't seem to do that.
[411:19.72]Strength does.
[411:22.88]Mortality does.
[411:23.74]I feel like I'm taking a lot of hits.
[411:31.64]A lot of hits.
[411:44.55]Kind of don't know what to do right now.
[411:45.53]Maybe I should get just dexterity at 25.
[411:53.20]Or maybe I should get strength at 15.
[411:55.30]No, I'm going to do Endurance.
[412:04.05]I did get new armor.
[412:04.65]You're right.
[412:05.27]You are correct.
[412:11.21]It was... Fallen.
[412:14.06]Ooh.
[412:14.36]Hmm.
[412:16.70]Don't mind if I do.
[412:17.46]Hmm.
[412:22.54]Okay.
[412:24.23]Do I actually get to be the Grim Reaper now?
[412:30.27]Yep.
[412:31.57]Alright.
[412:32.86]I'm like the Night Grim Reaper.
[412:35.12]I can stop playing the game.
[412:36.50]I don't have to play the game ever again.
[412:37.50]Am I gonna fat roll?
[412:42.38]Not really.
[412:45.23]Kylo Ren.
[412:49.19]Dusty Kylo Ren.
[412:54.07]With a big smile in the middle of his face.
[412:55.61]Alright, let's go.
[413:02.56]I need to get some more.
[413:03.58]I might need to do some exploring back in the first area.
[413:06.42]Because I only got one Estus Flask Shard.
[413:11.00]I feel like there's like two or three places I didn't go back here either.
[413:13.96]Like around the high wall.
[413:15.02]There's too much to do.
[413:20.32]Too much to do.
[413:33.68]But I do have a lot more armor now, which is a good thing.
[413:39.41]Did I even check back here for anything?
[413:40.73]Not really.
[413:47.77]I never killed a big fat guy that spun around.
[413:49.28]Yeah, I didn't.
[413:50.10]I didn't do a lot of things, did I?
[413:55.70]Usually how I do this is when I play a game like this, I just...
[413:59.62]Go through it, just progress.
[414:01.22]Go to A to B to C to D. Second playthrough is when I would really slow down and take my time and look at everything and do everything with the second character.
[414:10.15]I thought I was going to get it before he did that.
[414:16.83]Before she did that.
[414:18.89]Whatever this character's gender is.
[414:27.19]These guys have three hits now instead of four or five.
[414:29.23]That was a real pain in the ass.
[414:37.33]Forget about the crabs.
[414:40.67]Let's just go this way.
[414:42.49]Come on.
[414:44.41]Can't handle that much of a fall.
[414:47.15]That much of a wuss.
[414:52.04]There's a lot of you over here.
[414:56.93]That's the poison.
[415:00.81]Getting overwhelmed.
[415:01.51]I think there's a giant stick guy in him.
[415:08.51]You know what?
[415:09.09]Forget it.
[415:10.78]You guys were too stupid.
[415:11.64]You ran away from the item you were supposed to be protecting.
[415:15.00]Don't you know item protection 101?
[415:16.60]Never leave your post.
[415:22.07]Some dickhead like me will come around and just scoop it all up.
[415:27.49]Thank god I got that off.
[415:39.80]Is that a bonfire?
[415:48.93]Huh.
[415:50.50]Okay.
[415:51.68]There's another bonfire here.
[415:59.54]Uh... That's odd, because don't I start from, like, right over there?
[416:05.99]I don't know.
[416:10.65]I wonder if I can jump on this guy's head.
[416:12.83]Come on, let me do, like, a big jump and kill.
[416:15.52]Come on!
[416:19.55]Couple of items over here, though.
[416:29.90]I'm being so... That guy just turned.
[416:32.58]The way that guy turned.
[416:38.04]You cannot turn that fast and smash your right hand down.
[416:43.70]That was so perfectly timed for right when I walked even close to him.
[416:47.43]Hand down.
[416:53.12]That was stupid.
[416:59.72]Although, I could just go this way.
[417:05.89]Dead.
[417:17.48]What else is down here?
[417:22.07]An Ember.
[417:22.85]I might take an Ember right now.
[417:33.69]Swing too many times.
[417:37.65]Just get burnt by the fire and die.
[417:39.07]That would make me happier.
[417:41.95]Return of the Crossman.
[417:50.66]Okay.
[417:52.46]I guess we're doing it.
[417:54.40]We are doing it.
[417:55.68]Too busy focusing on how stupid that was.
[418:02.74]Baseball swing.
[418:04.43]I don't know why I keep doing that.
[418:06.55]This is so bad.
[418:08.95]This is so bad.
[418:10.49]Ugh.
[418:11.71]Ugh.
[418:13.27]Ugh.
[418:16.86]That wouldn't even hurt.
[418:19.80]My, like, older brother did that to me when I was in, like, the sixth grade.
[418:22.82]It didn't even fucking hurt.
[418:26.05]He, like, hit me with a big branch like that.
[418:27.79]And we both laughed about it.
[418:29.25]I don't know why these two are giving me so much trouble.
[418:42.68]It's just spear enemies.
[418:43.74]Spear enemies in general just drive me off the fucking wall.
[418:51.73]The insane reach that some of the enemies have.
[418:53.49]In ran- oooooooh.
[418:58.49]How do I do it? How do I do it? How do I do it?
[419:09.60]An Estus Flask?
[419:19.60]You know what I got?
[419:20.48]Estus Flask.
[419:21.22]Mm-hmm.
[419:21.60]I don't even care.
[419:23.06]I'm one of those guys that doesn't care.
[419:24.89]And he gets like, he gets like, all the ladies.
[419:26.69]Mm-hmm.
[419:27.33]Yeah.
[419:28.45]Let's go.
[419:28.87]Oh, that was worth it, actually.
[419:39.39]Throw all my complaining.
[419:47.36]Couldn't go back in the castle.
[419:54.31]Or I could go in here.
[419:55.09]There's so many people in here.
[420:08.02]Nope.
[420:08.68]That's not going to work.
[420:13.30]Okay, she's really fast.
[420:15.30]I'm going to queue up a swing for somebody.
[420:21.35]Here you come.
[420:21.85]Here you come.
[420:22.33]Here you come.
[420:22.81]Here you come.
[420:24.05]Here you come.
[420:26.02]Here you come.
[420:26.70]Here you come!
[420:29.00]I was trying to introduce you.
[420:37.61]These places always confuse the hell out of me.
[420:39.45]What's going on?
[420:43.25]No, they're all trying to hit me through the wall.
[420:48.01]Bunch of dummies.
[420:53.46]I was here before, wasn't I?
[421:00.60]How did he get down here?
[421:03.72]Because I just fell around the other side.
[421:16.83]These enemies weren't here before.
[421:18.01]They must have ran all the way around.
[421:21.19]Kind of like what I did.
[421:24.66]So we're all stupid.
[421:37.27]I could just not even care about this and just go back to the bonfire because I don't have any health anymore.
[421:41.49]I'm just going to run.
[421:42.77]I'm just doing the run technique.
[421:48.49]Anything up here?
[421:48.91]Anything up here?
[421:49.29]Nope.
[421:55.29]I'm lost.
[421:56.15]I'm lost in the castle.
[421:57.57]Find... Okay, I remember that hole.
[422:01.59]I do remember that hole.
[422:05.97]What else is in here?
[422:08.15]Oh, you just picked me off.
[422:12.18]Alright.
[422:13.56]What the hell is that?
[422:15.54]Oh, fuck, it's a boss.
[422:18.66]Oh, no.
[422:21.46]Alright, please be the easiest boss in the whole game.
[422:30.31]The crystals shoot crystals.
[422:31.59]Is that what I'm seeing?
[422:33.57]Can I break these?
[422:34.29]I guess not.
[422:41.06]Oh, no.
[422:45.30]Looks like she just sits in that same corner a little.
[422:49.35]Well, now I know where to run to.
[422:51.13]After I get my Estus Flash shard.
[422:56.40]Do I know where to run to?
[422:57.24]I feel like that part of my brain is gone.
[423:06.52]Mariachi, where is it?
[423:08.38]There's a new person.
[423:08.94]There's a new person.
[423:10.18]Oh, a new person!
[423:12.68]I am Siris of the Sunless Realms, former servant of the Divinity.
[423:18.00]It's bedtime.
[423:18.88]It's never bedtime.
[423:20.66]But one's duty is a solitary affair.
[423:23.04]I doubt we've much to gain from fraternization.
[423:29.41]Thank you.
[423:30.01]Is that it?
[423:34.53]Okay.
[423:37.51]Alright, Herbert.
[423:39.47]Give me a better Estus Flask.
[423:41.29]I always put a T. Or a K. I put a K at the end of Estus Flask for some dumb reason.
[423:50.82]Got it to six.
[423:51.72]Okay.
[423:58.41]Another person.
[423:58.89]Where are these people coming from?
[424:00.13]Or is she sitting here the whole time?
[424:03.19]Hmm.
[424:03.69]And then she sees like a...
[424:25.40]Please tell me you can sell weapons.
[424:26.58]Please tell me you can sell weapons.
[424:27.44]Yes, you can sell weapons.
[424:30.43]You can sell weapons and it's not a massive pain in the ass to have to go to a completely different spot to do it.
[424:37.27]Thank you.
[424:38.67]Thank you.
[424:39.27]Because I'm just going to get rid of all this junk.
[424:43.00]I don't need the whip.
[424:44.98]I don't need the K-Ace dust.
[424:49.48]Large club.
[424:53.09]Uh, mail breaker.
[424:53.85]I'm not going to use this for anything.
[424:55.73]Broken sword.
[424:56.43]Who needs a broken sword in their inventory?
[424:57.99]Nobody.
[425:03.06]Club.
[425:03.38]Oh, wait.
[425:06.98]Give umbral ash.
[425:11.80]What does it do?
[425:14.04]I have no idea.
[425:15.80]Rubbish.
[425:17.40]Get that out of my inventory.
[425:29.89]I might want to hold on to some of these.
[425:31.22]The rapier is not the worst.
[425:33.76]I don't think I'll ever be using this, unfortunately.
[425:39.65]I definitely won't be using this.
[425:54.62]So what does the umbralash do?
[425:55.70]If I give this to her, she just... I guess I could read it.
[425:58.38]Maybe she gives me an Estus Flash shard.
[426:05.50]Umbralash.
[426:05.98]I didn't know I saw it somewhere.
[426:09.39]Mortician says, shrine handmade will prepare new items.
[426:13.81]Huh, okay.
[426:14.97]I guess I'll just do it.
[426:16.93]You'll have new shit, I guess.
[426:19.49]Here, take it.
[426:21.67]Okay, well, what do you got now?
[426:26.75]Oh!
[426:33.14]You have snowballs!
[426:36.64]I love those.
[426:37.46]With the big marshmallow gob in the middle.
[426:39.26]Those things are amazing.
[426:47.55]Spitar.
[426:49.40]Scimitar.
[426:50.08]I think this is where you get the white soapstone for player content.
[427:05.81]Keys.
[427:06.21]Key to the dilapidated tower behind the shrine.
[427:09.72]Key to a door in the Undead Settlement sewer.
[427:16.05]I feel like you might be important at some point, lady.
[427:23.28]What is she doing for damage, that crystal lady?
[427:25.52]Is that dark?
[427:26.00]I think I have dark defense, don't I?
[427:31.12]Bleed, poison, frost, curse.
[427:34.22]Fire, magic, fire, lightning, dark.
[427:42.32]I mean, it doesn't seem like that she's going to be doing very much physical damage to me, so I'll put on the... Put on Father Gascoigne's robes.
[427:59.69]Right, I mean... Gardening old lady.
[428:11.76]Uh, right here.
[428:41.42]I see nothing wrong with this outfit.
[428:45.35]I kinda like the old gardening lady.
[428:48.53]Am I gonna keep this on for a while, even if it sucks?
[428:55.21]I love how she has a scythe too.
[428:57.57]Doesn't fit her character.
[428:59.47]She needs to be like a mage.
[429:01.85]That's pretty badass though.
[429:04.07]What is on my back?
[429:08.02]Why do I have a turtle shell?
[429:12.84]Where are those seeds?
[429:13.48]Where are those seeds, yeah?
[429:14.76]I gotta find my seeds.
[429:18.15]Let's go.
[429:18.43]Alright.
[429:22.57]Just gonna sprint to the area with the bosses, I think.
[429:27.99]And it was this building, right?
[429:30.01]I gotta get, like, a good route down.
[429:31.94]A good route.
[429:32.50]I think it was just right through here.
[429:36.06]I ran.
[429:36.54]I freaked out.
[429:37.40]I said, Oh, God, look at how many people are in this room.
[429:40.02]Whoa, look out.
[429:42.22]Wow, dude, look at- Oh, where do I go?
[429:43.90]Which way do I go?
[429:45.14]Fuck, I'm freaking out!
[429:47.88]Did you see that guy?
[429:48.82]Wow, dude, look out!
[429:51.32]Wow, that guy shoots like three times in a row!
[429:54.20]I can't believe it, this is so fucked up!
[430:00.06]Alright.
[430:01.06]Let's go!
[430:01.48]Let's go fight the Crystal Witch.
[430:12.40]Ooh, that hurt you, didn't it?
[430:15.12]She disappears.
[430:20.04]Should I break these?
[430:20.60]I guess.
[430:25.55]She's all over the place, huh?
[430:26.77]These crystals.
[430:34.46]Ooh.
[430:36.04]Almost.
[430:38.64]Almost.
[430:39.42]I'll give you some credit.
[430:41.36]You did almost get me.
[430:46.54]Okay, that hurts.
[430:48.42]You decide to swing at me now.
[430:50.34]You do have a weapon, don't you?
[430:57.54]If I hit her?
[430:59.52]Okay, I was making sure if it touched her, maybe she would...
[431:04.24]I'm not sure.
[431:04.72]It looks like they're actually getting staggered at some point there.
[431:10.22]What did they shoot?
[431:10.78]Okay, they blink and then they shoot.
[431:15.86]You got it.
[431:16.42]Okay.
[431:29.97]Hello, lady.
[431:36.43]Doesn't seem too bad.
[431:37.75]Now I say that now, but phase two of whatever she does might be pretty terrible.
[431:42.55]We're gonna be optimistic.
[431:55.76]Will you please appear?
[432:00.08]Okay, it's Bael from Diablo II.
[432:02.63]You thought you could sneak a Bael from D2 on me?
[432:07.69]Almost.
[432:09.01]Almost.
[432:11.09]She does get staggered.
[432:13.15]That's good to know.
[432:16.15]Holy shit in my diaper.
[432:21.09]Looks like she's in her phase two.
[432:22.67]Good lord.
[432:27.37]Good lord!
[432:37.64]She just skewered.
[432:38.38]I'm a kebab.
[432:39.72]She just kebabbed me.
[432:45.17]Yeah, you definitely have to find which one's the right one and just smoke her down.
[432:50.55]This shouldn't be too terrible.
[432:51.63]I just need to... You need to just run around and get her.
[432:56.59]Which one's the real one?
[432:58.59]Forget about all the other ones.
[432:59.44]Where's the real one?
[433:01.86]Back there.
[433:02.30]Look at that.
[433:12.78]Yeah, I think she shouldn't be too much of a problem.
[433:16.96]Especially when I put on my fucking pine resin.
[433:21.63]And start fucking annihilating.
[433:25.55]I'm just going to start swinging in every direction.
[433:28.03]Dark, David?
[433:28.87]Do you want to go dark?
[433:31.29]I'll dark the hell out of you.
[433:33.13]Although that probably doesn't do much.
[433:37.24]Take an ember.
[433:41.57]Get full health.
[433:43.07]I mean, I guess it can't hurt, right?
[433:44.99]I mean, even if it adds very little damage.
[433:47.35]Still might be worth doing.
[433:51.12]Still might be worth giving it a try.
[433:52.20]Take off the stupid.
[433:53.66]These things are pointless.
[433:55.24]So is this.
[433:55.82]Alright.
[434:01.03]Let's try it again.
[434:06.65]Thankfully, it's not that awful to get to.
[434:09.29]But it kind of is because you have to avoid all of these guys when they all shoot shit at you.
[434:19.02]Build up the endurance.
[434:19.80]Build up the endurance.
[434:24.16]The only guy that I need to worry about is not this one, but the guy in front of him.
[434:29.98]This guy right here shoots a pretty big blast.
[434:34.48]And I got by it.
[434:41.33]Oh shit.
[434:50.32]She casted that right in my fucking face.
[435:04.84]Come on, show me the money.
[435:08.86]Where are you?
[435:09.28]Where are you?
[435:09.66]Where are you?
[435:12.12]I'm sorry if I'm making people sick, but I gotta spin like that.
[435:19.43]Okay.
[435:20.47]Burned her to phase two.
[435:23.11]Where are the bail clones?
[435:24.37]Let me see them.
[435:25.21]Come at me.
[435:27.35]Suck it to me.
[435:35.10]Oh, come on.
[435:35.76]Really?
[435:35.94]Really?
[435:38.32]Shit stain.
[435:46.85]Oh, they're behind me now.
[435:49.03]This is not good.
[435:50.11]Not good.
[435:51.03]Ladies and gentlemen, I'm dead!
[435:53.30]Because they both fucking spawned behind me.
[435:56.74]And I did the stupid pioneer.
[435:59.62]I shouldn't have done the resin right there.
[436:00.76]That was such a mistake.
[436:02.86]That was a stupid mistake to make.
[436:07.71]I should not have done that.
[436:10.07]Not at all.
[436:13.97]But she wasn't showing up and the two clones were in almost the same corner.
[436:19.48]That's really annoying.
[436:31.47]Pain in the fucking ass.
[436:41.05]Where is that guy shooting me from, exactly?
[436:42.67]Before I flip the fuck out.
[436:47.27]Don't drive angry.
[436:49.39]Do not drive angry.
[436:59.46]Really, like, these stupid fucking crystals.
[437:01.78]Get away from me.
[437:02.48]I might have to just run those around in a circle.
[437:09.62]Come on, where are you?
[437:26.06]I'm so far away from her this time.
[437:27.84]Come on.
[437:39.47]Those things just have a massive hitbox and they follow you forever.
[437:42.96]Can I run them into a wall?
[437:44.78]Okay, I can run them into the walls.
[437:51.16]There's really only one reliable way to get rid of those.
[437:53.68]That's my last resin.
[438:12.31]Alright, here they come.
[438:18.52]He's gotta be moving around.
[438:19.36]Gotta be moving.
[438:19.98]Shoot, that's the right one.
[438:23.00]Shit, there's so many of them.
[438:45.67]Alright, can you hold off on the spam there, buddy?
[438:55.64]Like, really?
[438:56.64]That guy was shooting me with a blue machine gun.
[438:58.40]Okay, she's the last one.
[439:04.76]Oh my god.
[439:05.54]I forgot that ones can go in the air.
[439:15.09]I might not do it this time.
[439:17.29]Not looking like it's gonna be a victory.
[439:18.61]Unless I can find her immediately.
[439:21.38]Hope she's this one!
[439:24.88]She's not that one!
[439:27.99]Get behind a pillar!
[439:28.79]Get behind a pillar!
[439:43.99]This is crazy.
[439:49.17]It's just, you know, at that point, I think it's just a burn.
[439:51.11]Because if you hit her, she'll fall.
[439:53.39]She'll go down.
[439:57.08]But... My god.
[440:00.78]The amount of... Okay, so... I'm not sure if it's RNG based.
[440:05.32]It might be.
[440:07.39]But if she's in the opposite corner that you think she's going to be in, you are so screwed.
[440:17.31]Because she's going to have four other people shooting blue goo around the entire arena.
[440:23.59]And some of them even do it as if they are a fucking machine gun, like I said.
[440:28.24]So we're going to buy some more resin.
[440:30.80]I'm assuming, let's try like lightning.
[440:33.66]Does she sell those?
[440:35.77]Yeah, this became like a bullet hell game.
[440:39.69]Looks like it's gonna have to be charcoal.
[440:43.20]Because that's all she sells.
[440:47.03]I want at least two.
[441:02.61]And I think I'm going to take some green blossom as well.
[441:04.37]I feel like that would help a lot with dodging.
[441:17.72]Now I'll switch to the knife.
[441:20.84]I hope they only take like one hit.
[441:22.50]If it's more than one hit to kill the... I'm going to call them the servants.
[441:27.04]And I might be in some deep trouble.
[441:33.05]Yeah, she gets too many moves.
[441:35.69]Where are my frost moves?
[441:48.79]Actually, the... She is, I think, considered dark, isn't she?
[441:51.59]So maybe it would be better to have fire.
[441:57.29]Fire.
[441:59.69]And...
[442:05.93]Might not be the worst idea ever.
[442:08.95]To potentially hide and throw one of these.
[442:10.47]But I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna make that assumption right now.
[442:13.91]Because I got her pretty close last time.
[442:16.79]We're just gonna go for it again.
[442:20.25]Just go for it again.
[442:31.48]Don't be a magnet, enemy.
[442:32.40]Please don't be a magnet.
[442:37.99]I would appreciate it if you were not a magnet.
[442:42.79]This is the guy that can shoot all the way through the wall over here.
[442:48.97]Let's go!
[443:01.50]Break.
[443:07.69]Okay, this does a lot of damage, which is a good thing.
[443:12.22]Seems like the corner over there, the corner over there, and back, it's the corners.
[443:21.58]So far so good.
[443:25.05]I don't think she can be in the same corner twice.
[443:28.35]From my not so good understanding of what's happening.
[443:37.42]Here we go.
[443:47.68]Fuck, it wasn't in range.
[443:51.77]The range is so slow.
[443:53.35]So bad on that.
[443:55.07]You gotta be right in their face.
[443:57.15]Slow down, slow down.
[443:57.83]I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[444:03.65]Just gotta hit her once.
[444:05.11]She's in the corner.
[444:11.52]Champagne has always been celebrated.
[444:35.22]It's not going down.
[444:37.61]Go down, please!
[444:43.25]Wow!
[444:43.59]That's her.
[444:46.45]That's the one.
[445:08.83]She's over here.
[445:17.69]Don't want to kick her.
[445:18.79]I'm topping myself off.
[445:20.39]This is the one.
[445:38.80]That's not the person I wanted to lock onto.
[445:43.30]No, come on!
[445:44.66]That's... I fucking locked onto the wrong enemy.
[445:48.88]That was the one too.
[445:49.60]Like, it just locked onto the one all the way to the left.
[445:54.31]Seriously.
[445:55.31]If I hit the button, and it just goes... rips me to the left of my screen.
[446:00.57]That is such fucking bullshit.
[446:04.35]I shouldn't have even locked on.
[446:06.99]That seriously was the one.
[446:09.43]I don't have any pine resin left.
[446:10.42]I have to do some farming.
[446:14.02]How annoying.
[446:14.70]I have all the things to lock onto.
[446:22.01]Rip my screen to the left.
[446:24.43]Please.
[446:24.97]Please do.
[446:25.79]Please do.
[446:26.29]I will beat her.
[446:31.51]Just...
[446:34.20]For next time, do not lock on at that stage.
[446:39.37]Because it might just make you target somebody you don't want to target.
[446:48.92]There's a weapon.
[447:01.80]God damn, that's a fucking kick.
[447:11.39]580.
[447:11.49]I need more than that.
[447:24.69]And that is why I hate auto-lock or auto-aim in any game.
[447:28.93]Yeah.
[447:30.36]I mean, you live by the sword and you die by the sword.
[447:33.54]That's just one of those cases where... It really threw me off.
[447:38.76]Having to have this happen.
[447:40.80]Like... Like... Oh, we're ripping that way.
[447:46.19]Can't even, like, mimic it again.
[447:50.43]Okay, I don't want to die in here.
[447:53.37]I'm only doing this for the souls.
[448:08.43]Three will do it.
[448:15.03]These are both casters.
[448:15.99]I didn't realize the guy on the back was also casting.
[448:17.57]Fucking crazy room.
[448:27.77]I didn't realize what the fuck I just got myself into.
[448:30.43]Oh no!
[448:32.25]This is the guy with the fucking cross!
[448:45.29]You're not supposed to be able to do that.
[448:55.12]Please stop it from happening.
[449:05.23]Please stop it from happening.
[449:10.13]Kill some crabs too.
[449:20.73]I want 1500.
[449:21.25]That's enough for another attempt.
[449:29.47]Okay, daddy's here.
[449:36.78]Bye, dad.
[449:38.36]I'm out of here, dad.
[449:39.08]Actually, not out of here.
[449:46.70]I don't have any... I do.
[449:52.29]Just bring me to the shrine.
[450:08.64]Four away from 1500.
[450:09.26]Come on, come on.
[450:17.20]I will take three.
[450:17.90]Where's my discount?
[450:25.66]Can you give me a discount?
[450:27.28]I am the survivor of all horrible things.
[450:32.10]Alright.
[450:39.55]Here we go.
[450:46.41]Win or lose here.
[450:47.15]I think I might call this dream.
[450:48.91]I'm getting really tired.
[450:51.65]But I'm really enjoying the game.
[450:56.07]It's a lot of fun.
[450:57.69]But I've been going almost seven hours now.
[450:59.69]Or like six and a half or something.
[451:00.77]I feel like I could use a little break.
[451:05.62]Go to bed.
[451:06.64]Wake up.
[451:08.10]Maybe do it all over again.
[451:09.28]Do it again.
[451:12.54]Maybe I'll stream tomorrow morning.
[451:15.56]No, that is possible.
[451:20.64]Please don't block the door.
[451:22.80]Come to bed.
[451:40.20]Sucks that took a lot of time.
[451:48.40]Alright.
[451:52.34]Alright, no locking on.
[451:53.35]For a second, I thought she was over there.
[452:00.75]Where is she?
[452:02.69]She's right here.
[452:03.31]I didn't even want to lock on, but I just did.
[452:09.59]See, it's not terrible to lock on here.
[452:25.58]I think I'm losing it.
[452:27.62]I might have hit the point where I'm too tired.
[452:30.24]Because I'm forgetting things.
[452:32.02]It is possible.
[452:44.05]I wonder.
[452:45.49]Can I do it?
[452:52.36]What?
[453:06.06]What's up here?
[453:08.04]Like a little secret passage.
[453:10.58]In the corner.
[453:17.78]Why is there so many of those little balls flying around?
[453:24.19]Please disappear.
[453:24.95]Disappear.
[453:25.35]She's not disappearing.
[453:35.72]Thought I had her.
[453:36.62]Right when you get up right in front of her, she does that stupid fucking slash.
[453:43.32]I can't even hit her.
[453:44.42]They're in such a perfect place.
[453:48.29]Go around the corner and heal, and I'm gonna have to kill one of these guys.
[453:51.65]They're just perfectly hitting me.
[454:01.08]Oh boy, this is not good.
[454:02.98]This is not good.
[454:08.91]Fucking nightmare!
[454:21.89]It's just... There's too many abilities going on.
[454:26.77]I guess I have to kill the clones.
[454:30.41]As tedious as that is.
[454:33.56]You know, I'm here.
[454:34.14]I'm right here.
[454:34.64]I'm just gonna do it again.
[454:37.26]Might as well.
[454:45.78]Might as well.
[454:46.52]I'm right here.
[454:56.31]The worst part is... So, killing the clones, right?
[454:59.59]They're so spread out that on your trip to kill one of the clones, you're still getting spammed at.
[455:06.19]But when you hit her enough times, the actual non-clone, they all disappear at the same time.
[455:15.34]So, I don't know.
[455:17.26]I wonder if that's... I'm going to give it a try.
[455:19.50]It's really...
[455:31.55]I don't really have a point of entry here.
[455:33.19]These things really need to... There's like five of these out right now.
[455:37.54]Come on.
[455:39.24]Give me a fucking break.
[455:41.94]Did you do a different move?
[455:43.28]Thank you.
[455:43.76]Run them into a pillar.
[456:10.49]I'm not close enough.
[456:21.80]It's very deceiving, because you gotta get her, like, right... Her dress is not a pittable thing, obviously.
[456:40.62]Is it time for clones?
[456:54.84]No, not yet.
[456:58.10]Now it's time for clones.
[457:13.69]Oh, the spike through the ground hit me.
[457:15.30]I didn't even see her casting it.
[457:40.60]You just have to run around like a chicken with your head cut off.
[457:47.66]I really need to just take out the knife.
[457:55.45]Once I run out of blossoms, it's pretty much over.
[457:57.17]I'm gonna have to grind a little later.
[458:09.08]I guess, like I said, live by the sword, die by the sword.
[458:11.70]I didn't walk on.
[458:13.34]So I just missed.
[458:14.22]I'm trying to dodge a hundred projectiles at the same time.
[458:20.40]I'm already taking hits here.
[458:21.96]This looks like it might be a back-to-bed situation.
[458:36.53]Dodge through those.
[458:40.49]Doesn't matter.
[458:42.37]Just did a fucking ton of damage to her, though.
[458:51.62]I'll just boot and shoot whatever.
[458:55.68]Not that time.
[458:56.30]I thought I could dodge through it.
[459:01.78]Underneath it?
[459:13.70]Come on, shoot it.
[459:16.14]No, how did I get onto the first one?
[459:17.56]Did I just get right underneath it?
[459:19.71]I'm really confused.
[459:25.73]Okay, well.
[459:29.69]This is the last attempt.
[459:31.25]Let's do it.
[459:35.78]There's two over here.
[459:38.94]Oh, here she is.
[459:48.03]oh
[460:17.13]Holy shit.
[460:18.51]How are you still on the living?
[460:23.71]I gotta guess right.
[460:24.75]Hopefully I guessed right.
[460:26.81]Didn't guess right.
[460:32.42]Is there one in the corner?
[460:34.24]Just this one right here.
[460:37.26]There's two.
[460:37.82]One to her left.
[460:38.58]One to my left.
[460:46.66]Oh my goodness.
[460:50.53]Oh, I'm so close.
[460:51.85]I'm so closed.
[460:58.73]I think this could be... I think this is the hardest boss in the game so far.
[461:02.27]At least for me.
[461:05.76]I definitely need more stuff, but do I really?
[461:08.90]I don't think I even do.
[461:14.33]You see what I'm talking about?
[461:16.31]Kill the clones sounds easy, but when you have to run around in a circle and hit them while they're doing all their moves, it almost feels like it's better just to hit the main one a couple times and they all go away.
[461:30.46]But damn.
[461:32.10]This is not the easiest boss I've played.
[461:36.38]That's for sure.
[461:38.66]Whoops-a-daisy.
[461:48.02]What, really?
[461:49.80]You're seriously gonna fucking do that to me?
[461:52.98]You stupid RNG boss.
[461:56.67]Does everything you do have to be based on, like, a random algorithm?
[462:01.73]Where you spawn, where you go, what moves you do.
[462:04.35]This whole boss is just a random, random encounter.
[462:13.55]See, you just gotta get lucky and try to find where she's gonna go.
[462:18.74]this corner maybe turning around is just not cool okay well I can't hear that next time so we're not gonna try it
[462:56.36]These things are still following me.
[463:03.28]Please just break.
[463:05.72]And they're coming from behind like that.
[463:07.12]This is such a nightmare.
[463:20.20]This is the moment of truth.
[463:21.09]I get here every single time now.
[463:24.54]She's right in against the wall.
[464:00.27]Don't do it.
[464:00.93]I gotta back up.
[464:09.60]Man, that was not a good couple of hits.
[464:17.66]Fuck.
[464:37.85]Come on my god Man It's just so okay, so let's let's break down what kind of happened there Giving her distance She's able to put out so many of those things.
[465:01.17]It's it's such a good rock in a hard place because do you
[465:07.62]You have to... I'm just going to die here.
[465:09.66]Just kind of standing around.
[465:12.56]The fact that... If you give her distance, any distance at all, she's going to have at least two to three of those huge giant hitbox explosion things.
[465:26.25]So you really just have to close the distance with her as fast as possible and try to get that hit on.
[465:31.01]It's a really, really weird rock-and-a-hard place, and I'm not sure what to do first.
[465:37.60]And the pillars, yeah, the pillars... Well, the pillars break the... Explosions.
[465:44.20]But, they just take... They're such slow-moving projectiles.
[465:47.93]This boss sucks.
[465:50.57]This is way worse than the tree boss.
[465:52.03]The tree boss was a chump in comparison to this.
[465:54.17]This is... Of course, please snipe me a hundred times from the back.
[465:59.07]That's great.
[465:59.45]Because even right now, like, she's like, Here we go, I'm gonna start casting shit!
[466:04.72]And it's all RNG-based.
[466:07.15]So what is she gonna do?
[466:08.95]Like, what are you gonna get?
[466:10.55]Is she gonna do, like, four of those stupid big huge explosion balls in a row?
[466:14.28]Or is she gonna do the line pillar thing in front of herself?
[466:21.30]See?
[466:21.42]Here we go.
[466:21.80]Oh, what the fuck was that?
[466:22.54]Here comes, like, the pillars.
[466:26.90]I just kind of beat the shit out of her right here, though.
[466:39.88]See, right now, I am getting really extraordinary RNG right now.
[466:44.63]Because she hasn't casted any of those projectiles.
[466:48.37]Those are what's giving me the most trouble.
[467:01.57]Please don't do it.
[467:03.97]That spawns so fast.
[467:07.27]Oh, yes!
[467:17.40]This is criminy.
[467:20.06]Jiminy biscuit.
[467:28.74]That's her.
[467:32.52]See?
[467:32.82]Like, now they're all gone.
[467:36.11]Tongue, I want to be full health.
[467:37.87]You just gotta sprint to where she is.
[467:39.73]And you hope you get it right.
[467:42.37]That is not right.
[467:47.31]Although these spawned in a pretty not awful place.
[467:52.01]Just kind of walked into that one.
[467:57.49]This is as close as I'm gonna get so far.
[468:16.57]Got it.
[468:17.59]Oh my god, it just screwed me.
[468:18.63]Did you see the kick?
[468:20.03]The kick just almost ruined everything.
[468:23.88]I'm gonna have to just guess.
[468:24.72]I'm gonna guess like this corner.
[468:25.86]Which corner?
[468:29.58]Not it.
[468:42.73]I did another kick.
[468:47.45]She was dead, too.
[468:48.93]But... I pressed up.
[468:51.61]And swung.
[468:55.71]Yep.
[468:56.29]Sorry, guys.
[468:57.21]I pressed my light attack button, but I also had to... I was trying to move my character, so I went like this.
[469:02.43]I... That is so... That is... I...
[469:17.84]I don't know.
[469:18.28]That button combination just feels like it never should have been put in the game.
[469:24.92]Holy shit.
[469:27.94]Why would you make it so when you pushed up and attacked, like this, that's when you hit right trigger.
[469:34.12]But it's just happening just moving around.
[469:37.11]Like if I turn and try to move and then attack somebody, you just do it.
[469:47.98]I got hit by that, in some magic way.
[469:58.70]The boss forces you to kick, it's one of her spells.
[470:04.26]That would be funny.
[470:30.93]Just gonna have to try to pick right.
[470:33.57]She's never in the middle.
[470:34.76]She's always in one of the corners.
[470:46.52]Why is that last one not shooting?
[470:51.87]like that one's just sat there for so long what was that what on Earth was that I'm getting concerned I'm fine don't worry
[471:17.36]See the spawn I got right now?
[471:19.60]Check out this spawn.
[471:21.44]One behind me, one in front of me.
[471:24.06]Eek.
[471:25.96]Eek the cat, I would say.
[471:27.58]Eek.
[471:27.74]Because you have to run yourself around the whole area while people are just... Please don't kick this time.
[471:45.15]Please don't kick this time.
[471:50.14]That wasn't her.
[471:52.22]She's in the other corner.
[472:05.66]I'm just gonna get comboed.
[472:08.56]Shit.
[472:16.93]11 days before I die from lack of sleep.
[472:30.06]I wonder if... Let's see what the next boss is after this one.
[472:34.56]I'm gonna be here before I go to bed.
[472:36.46]That's very important.
[472:41.66]He's gonna get away from me.
[472:42.52]I can't see.
[472:42.98]He's blocking my rearview mirror, dude.
[472:52.92]Where's my crab fun?
[472:54.48]Crab fun.
[472:55.49]My crab friend.
[473:03.79]That's a good one to get first because you can dodge right by it.
[473:14.68]You can go to sleep, Kim.
[473:15.72]You're not going to stay up.
[473:16.32]You don't have to let me torture you.
[473:22.60]You can head to bed.
[473:24.28]You're here.
[473:25.26]You're modding.
[473:26.53]You've done a great job so far, so thanks.
[473:27.91]I really appreciate it.
[473:30.67]You have done a fine job.
[473:31.76]You like that play?
[473:47.99]That's what we call getting shit done.
[473:51.51]How do they say that while I can spare?
[474:10.31]I think that's it.
[474:26.13]She just did like three moves at the same time.
[474:34.50]Holy Toledo.
[474:42.63]No, there's nobody on this side.
[474:44.47]Aye, aye, aye.
[474:50.89]Nobody spawned on this side.
[474:52.43]They're all on the other side.
[474:54.17]That is not good.
[475:03.44]It's like all clumped up over here.
[475:05.88]Look at how clumped these guys are.
[475:08.92]Don't be so clumped.
[475:10.42]Don't do it.
[475:26.01]Really, I couldn't even see it through the wall.
[475:27.50]It's gonna be tough.
[475:45.76]I gotta have to get lucky.
[475:50.94]That's not lucky.
[475:53.48]That is not lucky.
[476:07.10]It's such carnage.
[476:15.43]Jesus Christ.
[476:18.75]Oh my god.
[476:32.25]You know what might do me some good?
[476:34.52]I think what might do me some good...
[476:37.41]is to go... I mean, if I'm getting her down to, like, 20 or 30% every time, with, like, a real attempt, I might as well go get the things that are necessary.
[476:55.88]Go to bed.
[477:00.78]So I'm going to go back to one of the areas from before.
[477:03.50]And just do a little bit of grinding.
[477:05.63]So I can get some more materials.
[477:09.53]Materials.
[477:11.59]Let's go... Here.
[477:16.03]I don't... I destroyed the crystals the first couple times I did it.
[477:21.11]Didn't really seem to do much.
[477:23.97]Was that supposed to, like, help?
[477:26.18]Didn't notice any substantial difference.
[477:44.27]Kind of underestimating how much health these guys had.
[477:45.83]Aww, I had the same idea.
[477:51.77]You just want your souls.
[478:01.34]That's all I want.
[478:02.10]That's all I want.
[478:09.37]Yeah, if some of you guys want to go to bed, go for it.
[478:11.85]I mean, I was just really excited for this game, so I'm going to just play the absolute hell out of it, you know what I mean?
[478:18.75]I'm going to set myself a very strict curfew, but I have to beat this boss before going to bed.
[478:23.38]You know why I have to do it before going to bed?
[478:25.02]Because I don't want to wake up and fight this boss.
[478:28.06]You know what I mean?
[478:28.52]That's something I have to wake up to if I play this game tomorrow.
[478:34.87]Oh, lord.
[478:37.46]Alright, funny story, I've actually never seen her swing that mace more than once.
[478:49.47]Why am I going in the direction with all the extremely beefy enemies?
[478:52.25]Don't ask me why.
[479:04.71]I'll just hurt him.
[479:05.95]I'm flabbergasted at the moment.
[479:10.97]Let's go this way.
[479:15.35]Not even midnight on the west coast.
[479:16.61]That's true.
[479:17.09]It's still early.
[479:22.77]Destroying the crystals.
[479:26.93]I just got jump scared for real.
[479:28.13]I thought he was supposed to be my friend.
[479:31.16]That's not cool.
[479:41.01]The answer will come to me in my sleep.
[479:46.20]No, there really is no answer.
[479:47.08]It's just... How much can you be against the bullet hell boss?
[479:58.25]It sucks, because once you understand a boss, once you figure out, like, oh, I think this is what I'm supposed to be doing.
[480:03.94]Like the tree boss, for instance, right?
[480:05.08]I knew I was getting my ass kicked during the tree boss, but I knew why.
[480:09.94]Fuck, I gotta be careful here.
[480:19.71]With a boss like this that spawns in random locations and does random moves...
[480:24.56]It's just so... It's just so much chance can be left up to what you're actually dealing with.
[480:30.03]I'm gonna start praying.
[480:36.49]I'm not a spiritual man.
[480:39.97]Oh god, please stop comboing me.
[480:56.71]Threats.
[481:09.12]Kill these guys hopefully before the lady comes over.
[481:22.07]Wherever she is.
[481:24.36]And over to the fat lady sings.
[481:25.42]I think I might just go up here.
[481:42.54]The way that I see telling... The good witch... I'm going to call her the good witch.
[481:47.44]She's purple, always.
[481:48.70]The other ones are blue.
[481:49.92]But they always spawn in random locations.
[481:53.14]So, even if you know what color they are, I mean... That's... Probably the only indicator, I think.
[481:59.42]They're just always going to be in different spots.
[482:06.80]Can I open this yet?
[482:07.34]No.
[482:10.29]I almost have 1,500...
[482:13.85]Almost.
[482:23.30]I think I have a couple of souls, too.
[482:27.56]I could probably just go back.
[482:32.26]Well, the longer I sit and wait, the more spam fills the arena.
[482:37.05]You just have to get a combination of lucky... Get a combination of lucky...
[482:44.21]Be in the right place at the right time.
[482:46.89]Which is lucky.
[482:47.77]I don't really want to fight her.
[482:49.22]I just wanted to get a couple of risins.
[482:54.58]We'll kill the dog.
[482:55.40]These are easy.
[482:56.64]I'll say that.
[482:59.36]Watch the dog just kills me now.
[483:00.58]Bye.
[483:01.44]Hey, look.
[483:10.77]That's where I fell.
[483:12.41]Tree guy.
[483:19.50]I should probably get to like 2,000, but... Treading into more dangerous waters the longer I stay up.
[483:37.14]Wow.
[483:38.10]Okay.
[483:48.30]Alright, I'm gonna homer bone.
[483:49.22]I don't want to risk it.
[483:56.11]Take me to the shrine.
[484:03.95]I think this spam fluctuation Jerm is getting unlucky because he doesn't wait out the spam behind a pillar.
[484:08.71]Well, the problem with waiting behind a pillar is the real one, the Good Witch of the East.
[484:14.67]She has that move that you can't see if you're behind a pillar, and it goes under the ground.
[484:18.30]It's the spikes.
[484:19.76]So if you're just kind of waiting for an opportunity, you might just get hit for, like, 50% of your HP because of the spike thing on the ground.
[484:28.30]So...
[484:37.00]Stay with the dark.
[484:38.24]I just... I had it beat.
[484:40.65]Unfortunately.
[484:41.93]I really, really just got totally, totally just ruined by this.
[484:47.31]By the kick move.
[484:54.74]Has anybody else, like... Am I the only person that's actually complained about that?
[484:58.06]I wonder if it's a just me thing.
[485:08.94]I'm not sure if anybody else has, like, said that that's, uh, annoying.
[485:15.57]Does she sell gold pine?
[485:16.51]I don't think she sells gold pine, does she?
[485:18.45]At least I was, uh, fire and dark, right?
[485:34.89]It is annoying, but you need to learn to not hold forward.
[485:38.19]That's just the way I'm... That's just the way I'm bred, man.
[485:40.59]In any game, if I want to be moving in a direction, I'm going to move in that direction.
[485:44.99]Let's give it a go.
[485:56.29]Like... Ay-yi-yi.
[486:01.07]Right when I get in the door.
[486:04.69]I was like, that sucks.
[486:09.52]What, there was one still behind me?
[486:11.14]Oh, sorry.
[486:12.44]Back to bed.
[486:13.20]I think this one might be a wash already.
[486:14.58]Maybe not.
[486:25.65]I don't know.
[486:26.71]I don't know.
[486:35.39]Where is she?
[487:13.28]Yikes.
[487:13.44]This is too spread out.
[487:14.28]I have to kill this one.
[487:32.03]Ah!
[487:49.10]I didn't take an Ember either.
[487:52.86]Got lucky.
[487:53.34]I got really lucky here.
[487:59.30]It's gonna happen again.
[488:05.86]Let the luck flow through you!
[488:16.79]One hit.
[488:41.91]I did it.
[488:46.91]Could have held it longer than that.
[488:56.14]That fucking boss sucked.
[489:03.63]Yay!
[489:06.19]That was... That was painful.
[489:14.73]I can finally get off the damn toilet.
[489:17.13]Sorry, can you just sit there?
[489:18.27]I can't... I'm not getting off.
[489:19.15]I'm not gonna start wiping until he beats this boss.
[489:21.23]You're gonna have like a crusty ass.
[489:27.92]You won't even need to wipe your ass anymore.
[489:29.58]There'll be nothing there.
[489:40.44]Okay, let me light this.
[489:46.49]I'm so glad that's over with.
[489:48.73]My, like, heart right now is inside of my neck.
[489:55.57]There was a point when I needed that last hit.
[489:58.97]It was a huge opportunity for me to get just comboed when I ran for that hit.
[490:04.89]And I would have been a very sad boy.
[490:12.64]But I'm going to level up a little bit.
[490:16.93]I'm assuming that the boss soul for this is probably a sorcery item.
[490:20.35]Considering how... All the sorcery annoying things and shit that she was doing.
[490:29.62]No, that's a death wish.
[490:32.92]I did that without an ember.
[490:34.94]I didn't have an ember.
[490:40.76]How many boss attempts was that?
[490:43.02]That had to have been more than 10, right?
[490:45.44]Was that like 10 or 15?
[490:46.48]How many, like, does anyone remember?
[490:47.63]What am I keeping count?
[491:00.59]15.
[491:01.09]Yikes.
[491:03.95]Something about that encounter was just, I couldn't do it.
[491:08.35]There was just too much spam in the room.
[491:11.00]It's 25.
[491:11.20]It's time to go to sleep, Mr. Moobler.
[491:13.24]Good night, dude.
[491:32.75]Yeah, anybody that's still sticking around.
[491:38.42]You're under no obligation to stay here.
[491:43.08]I was just super excited for this game.
[491:47.16]It's fun to be angry, right?
[491:49.04]I'm just going to break it.
[491:51.04]I don't want the... I think it's a rapier, right?
[491:56.21]That should get me another level.
[491:57.53]Or two.
[492:11.62]Farewell, Ashen One.
[492:12.96]Farewell.
[492:18.44]How many attempts did it feel like?
[492:19.48]A hundred.
[492:20.68]It felt like two to three hundred.
[492:22.50]I need some Titanite Shards, man.
[492:35.18]I don't have any.
[492:37.26]For thee, be careful.
[492:46.64]Keep going till you finish the game?
[492:48.14]Duh.
[492:49.18]I don't know about that.
[492:51.96]What do we got for time?
[492:55.72]What's the time right now?
[493:08.91]It's probably pretty late.
[493:21.38]Uh, I'm just gonna see what the next area is.
[493:23.92]And then I'm probably gonna call it.
[493:24.66]Let's get to the next bonfire.
[493:25.92]So I can be prepared.
[493:29.35]Yeah, it's a good time to stop.
[493:30.75]So I'm just gonna get to the next bonfire.
[493:37.35]It's a pretty good place to stop.
[493:38.68]Let's get to the next bonfire and stop.
[493:49.94]I just want to see what's around the bend.
[493:52.72]Yeah, I did say that.
[493:53.84]I did say that.
[493:54.60]I said this is the last attempt over an hour ago.
[493:59.25]You can hold me accountable for that one.
[494:06.27]New enemy.
[494:10.43]Almost didn't make that jump.
[494:12.29]Thought it was worth it, maybe.
[494:13.45]Because there is a jewel box.
[494:18.40]Twinkling Titanite is the next step That was a bonfire for a second right there Rocky area That's one of these guys
[494:47.80]I got through that.
[494:55.63]Some new gear.
[494:56.21]I probably should take off the magic resistance stuff, huh?
[495:09.26]There's the bonfire.
[495:10.80]See, look.
[495:12.40]We made it right immediately.
[495:16.60]Good to go.
[495:19.78]Alright, guys.
[495:22.36]Thank you so much for watching.
[495:24.00]Thanks to all the new subs, all the people that stuck around and put up with my rage.
[495:31.49]I didn't get that bad.
[495:34.19]I just talked about shitting in my diaper.
[495:37.67]It's a pretty typical Monday night, Tuesday night for me.
[495:41.88]As long as I talk about going to the bathroom in a diaper at least once, then something was good.
[495:46.83]I think I called the boss a piece of shit.
[495:49.24]Maybe like a hundred times.
[495:50.48]Maybe ten.
[495:50.98]I don't know.
[495:54.50]Tomorrow, I have a video to make.
[495:58.00]So I need to finish it because it's like half done.
[496:00.92]So I don't know.
[496:02.57]We'll see.
[496:03.25]You may or may not see me tomorrow afternoon.
[496:06.63]Right from where I left off right here.
[496:11.09]Despite all his rage, he's still just a Jerm in a cage.
[496:14.03]That's right.
[496:16.63]He's going to continue playing after the stream.
[496:18.33]No, I'm not.
[496:19.41]I'm going to bed.
[496:22.30]But yeah, take it easy, guys.
[496:24.02]I think Star is still streaming.
[496:25.90]I think he's still playing Dark Souls.
[496:26.98]So if you want more Dark Souls 3, then I think he's still going.
[496:32.82]Much love.
[496:34.08]Take care, guys.
[496:35.32]And goodbye.
