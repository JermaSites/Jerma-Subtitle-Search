[01:32.68]Oh.
[01:38.56]What's going on?
[01:38.88]How are you guys doing?
[01:40.68]What's up, everyone?
[01:42.12]I'm fantastic.
[01:42.80]It's Thursday.
[01:43.48]Late, late.
[01:43.80]I started streaming at 7.
[01:44.70]Just because you got here at like 7.02 doesn't mean that I started streaming at 7.02.
[01:57.15]Like, if you walked in here at 8 o'clock, I didn't start the stream at 8 o'clock.
[02:00.59]You came in at 8.
[02:01.29]You know what?
[02:01.59]You're gone.
[02:03.33]You know what?
[02:03.63]You're just gone.
[02:05.59]Ah, my phone is dead.
[02:06.55]Gonna have to chill for a minute.
[02:10.01]Uh, so.
[02:12.45]We're gonna play, uh, Call of Duty.
[02:17.70]No, not Call of Duty.
[02:18.54]What the fuck is Call of Juarez?
[02:21.16]Call of Juarez Gunslinger tonight.
[02:23.85]I'm gonna give it a try.
[02:24.85]We got like 15 backup games.
[02:27.01]So if this is like a straight up just not fun game, there's like at least like five things I can just jump into.
[02:34.21]I bought, I went on an Amazon kick again and I'm like buying a bunch of shit on Amazon.
[02:38.18]We're gonna have like another one of those nights where like I bought like, I'm getting like a bunch of PlayStation 3 games.
[02:49.00]It's gonna be one of the, like we'll get like a couple of days of like some more weird shit.
[02:55.15]Trust me, Gunslinger is great.
[02:57.07]All I've heard is good things about this game.
[02:59.55]Ever since I first started playing these, like, Western games, even before, like, Red Dead, even before, like, fucking Mad Dog McCree, everybody's like, play Gunslinger.
[03:08.27]It's, like, one of the better first-person shooter Western games that have come out in a long time.
[03:11.85]And I'm like, really?
[03:13.15]But it's, like, a Calahuares game.
[03:14.47]And, like, aren't the Calahuares games, like, kind of shitty?
[03:17.91]I've played Calahuares before.
[03:21.15]There's a video on my channel of Call of Juarez.
[03:23.81]And it was like a dumpy game.
[03:27.65]Anyways.
[03:29.39]Oh, here comes a disaster stream.
[03:30.84]It might, but who knows.
[03:34.18]This one is great.
[03:37.72]Gunslinger's way different.
[03:38.74]Okay.
[03:41.46]Alright, well.
[03:42.92]I still have to make a tweet, so.
[03:46.38]We're going to hang out for a minute.
[03:49.52]You know, you may see a disaster stream.
[03:51.44]It's possible.
[03:53.14]But I don't think so.
[03:55.20]I'm prepared.
[03:55.90]This is not Red Dead Redemption, the first, like, two streams of that game.
[04:03.91]They may as well just be a different series.
[04:05.37]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[04:06.01]You might want to get the FOV fix.
[04:09.65]I already did.
[04:12.46]We're talking prepared streamer.
[04:14.52]I did the FOV fix.
[04:16.52]I did the border... The comic book border window thing is gone.
[04:21.70]I made sure to... I've been here.
[04:24.26]Working.
[04:25.44]I've been here.
[04:26.36]Working.
[04:28.64]What was I going to talk about?
[04:30.42]I was going to talk to you guys about something today.
[04:32.92]Oh, shit.
[04:33.96]It's gone.
[04:34.38]I've got to get it back.
[04:34.94]I was going to have a fucking conversation with you guys about something.
[04:38.49]What was it?
[04:41.91]Oh man, this is going to eat me up inside.
[04:44.37]I was in my fridge today and I wanted to talk to you about something.
[04:47.51]That was on my mind.
[04:48.51]And now I can't remember what it is.
[04:53.47]Shit.
[04:56.21]Oh well, maybe it'll come to me.
[04:59.24]Weren't you about to tweet something?
[05:00.46]Yeah, my phone was dead.
[05:01.30]I'm just waiting for it to... I'm going to just tweet that I'm streaming.
[05:06.94]Ladies and gentlemen, like the Jermacraft shit.
[05:11.49]Like, no Jerma crap.
[05:13.49]Like, you know, we're going to kill the meme stream, okay?

[05:21.91]And we're going to fucking all these memes.
[05:24.28]We're going to laugh about them.
[05:25.96]We're going to talk about them.
[05:26.94]I'm going to, like, put them on screen.
[05:29.08]And then I'm going to kill them on screen.
[05:31.70]You know what I mean?
[05:32.26]Like, I'm gonna, like, go into, like, paint or something, and we're going to, like, stab these memes in the chest with a fucking, with, like, one of those crosses.
[05:40.82]Like it's a vampire through the heart.
[05:44.19]Kill the meme stream is, like, coming pretty soon.
[05:46.35]Let me, uh, tweet and we'll get going.
[05:56.83]We have to kill the meme.
[06:01.02]Memes didn't do anything wrong.
[06:03.18]No, they didn't you can't kill an idea No, it's mine I can kill it I said it I'm gonna put my hands around its neck and I'm gonna strangle it I Created it so I will destroy it and that's what's gonna happen.

[06:48.44]No, it's not.
[06:55.14]We're having a little bit of a comedic talk here.
[06:59.95]I'm in a weird mood again.

[08:19.51]Not that much though.
[08:20.77]Alright.
[08:21.93]Let's do story.
[08:22.41]I'm not going to do hard.
[08:25.59]It's too loud.
[08:27.81]This looks like Borderlands 2.
[08:32.19]Will you ever make an FMV game?
[08:33.91]Yes, I want to.
[08:35.59]We'll talk about that later, though.
[08:37.88]120 hertz?

[08:40.22]Normal, normal, no hard.
[08:41.64]Not true west, not hard.
[08:42.70]Is it too loud?
[08:43.28]Well, here comes an even louder noise.
[08:45.00]Brace yourselves.
[08:49.09]We're in Abigail.
[08:51.41]Abigail Hanses, 1910.
[08:54.34]Don't.
[08:55.14]Don't do it.
[08:56.02]I know you're thinking about doing it, but don't do it.
[09:03.33]Loud.
[09:07.49]This really is just like Red Dead again.
[09:12.13]Please don't play the campaign.
[09:13.95]What?
[09:14.99]Don't I know you, sir?
[09:17.15]Look at this budget.
[09:18.73]I haven't been here in many years.
[09:20.83]Name's Silas Greaves.
[09:23.03]Silas Greaves?
[09:24.69]The bounty hunter?
[09:26.35]Used to be.
[09:28.40]What are you doing here in Abilene?
[09:30.70]Just passing through.
[09:32.84]This game is awful.
[09:35.04]Well, sir, it would be an honor if you would allow me to buy you a beer.
[09:38.97]You can have it.
[09:39.55]Sure thing, man.
[09:40.19]Well, son, it would be my honor to drink it.
[09:42.63]I'm Molly.
[09:43.51]Howdy.
[09:44.17]I'm just like the undertaker.
[09:45.19]This is cool.
[09:45.79]That's Jack and Steve.
[09:47.27]Ben's behind the bar.
[09:49.69]I bet you got some great stories.
[09:52.03]A couple.
[09:52.57]Budget Red Dead.
[09:53.79]Any of them true?
[09:55.93]I like this guy's voice.
[09:56.77]It's just Dr. T. It's just Dr. T from the Electric Mayhem.
[09:58.74]Yeah, that's what I did.
[09:59.62]Don't believe everything you read in them dime novels, boy.
[10:12.70]First man I hunted was back when I was riding with Billy the Kid.
[10:16.44]You knew Billy the Kid?
[10:18.32]Damn right.
[10:19.82]That scrawny son of a bitch had no fear.
[10:23.17]Wouldn't back down for nobody.
[10:24.59]Do the mouth face, Kim?
[10:25.87]What the fuck is a dime novel?
[10:26.61]I don't know.
[10:27.01]This is really loud.
[10:27.97]I'm so sorry that every video game does this.
[10:41.91]Alright, there's the cutscene.
[10:49.61]Welcome... to... I forgot the name of the game already.
[10:54.70]Welcome... What's the name of this game?
[11:01.62]Su- Show the move.
[11:05.29]Gunslinger.
[11:05.99]Call of Duty.
[11:06.85]Call of Juarez Gunslinger.
[11:08.33]Alright, let's start the game.
[11:10.85]There we go.
[11:11.31]I'm excited.
[11:13.23]Oh, this game looks like shit.
[11:15.78]Oh, no, never mind.
[11:16.46]Billy was hiding out in an abandoned farm near Stinkin' Springs.
[11:19.98]Billy was very stinky.
[11:21.69]Oh, I got control now.
[11:22.65]Okay, okay.
[11:23.21]This, this... Hold on a second.
[11:24.94]This is way too sensitive.
[11:26.62]Well, I'll watch out.
[11:27.86]No, stop talking.
[11:28.78]Just wait a minute.
[11:30.18]This sensitivity is, like, fucking crazy.
[11:45.40]No, we're not nexting.
[11:46.36]This game's running like shit too.
[11:47.86]I don't know.
[11:48.28]Maybe it's like a stream of things.
[11:57.65]This is like running very poorly.
[12:00.75]I don't know why.
[12:01.39]Bourbon whiskey.
[12:07.16]Do I have any guns?
[12:10.38]Hold on a second.
[12:11.36]I gotta turn something down here.
[12:16.40]Like, we're gonna have to go with a little bit of fucking... I might have to turn VSync on.
[12:20.24]I don't think this game can, like, handle 120 Hz.
[12:24.61]Let's turn on VSync.
[12:28.21]I'm gonna have to.
[12:38.53]It makes it, like, a little bit better, I guess.
[12:44.06]Alright, what am I doing?
[12:45.14]Do I have to go look at cows?
[12:46.30]This is my bad PC.
[12:51.88]Yeah, my six core fucking 1080 Ti Ultra computer.
[12:57.77]What am I doing?
[12:58.25]Go to the hideout.
[13:00.49]I am at the hideout.
[13:04.43]Return to the hideout.
[13:07.26]Which apparently is like over here.
[13:09.58]Oh, okay.
[13:12.73]You know, try turning off OBS.
[13:14.59]Yeah, I'm going to have to turn OBS off.
[13:19.49]I got my gun.
[13:19.89]Oh, hold on.
[13:21.49]We're going to... Just give me a second here, guys.
[13:24.08]I got to plug it in.
[13:25.42]I got to plug it out and plug it in again.
[13:44.13]Uh, I'm gonna like stop capturing it and see what happens.
[13:47.57]Cause this is like, this is truly unbearable.
[13:49.66]Let's see here.
[13:53.80]Okay, yeah, it's like when OBS like pulls it.
[13:56.46]Alright, hold on.
[13:57.52]We're gonna do something wacky here.
[13:59.46]We're gonna do like a window capture.
[14:03.75]Let's do this wacky shit.
[14:05.39]I'm okay with it.
[14:07.97]Add window capture.
[14:10.41]Oh, you can see how much money I made!
[14:11.81]Oh shit!
[14:13.67]No, you can see I made that seven bucks!
[14:16.15]No, you can't see that!
[14:17.07]Turn it off quick, Jeremy!
[14:18.31]Quickly!
[14:18.99]Quickly!
[14:20.43]Fucking fail!
[14:28.22]Rich streamer.
[14:34.86]Call of Juarez.
[14:37.74]Let's put this back into a window.
[14:43.62]Yep, yep, yep.
[14:50.85]And go back over here.
[14:56.34]Come on now.
[14:59.24]Calahuares, there it is.
[15:00.42]Okay, let's like hope this helped because I don't know.
[15:05.56]This game is like, I can't stream this game.
[15:10.93]Okay, didn't really help like fucking at all, by the way.
[15:16.69]That was all for nothing.
[15:18.69]Maybe like 1% better.
[15:20.11]Wait, was I supposed to... Alright, I'm earning experience.
[15:33.48]You need it for leveling up and getting extra abilities, okay.
[15:35.72]Well, I just got double headshot right there.
[15:38.10]Was it Pat Garrett's posse?
[15:40.47]You know, this... Come on, now.
[15:45.51]What is with this shit?
[15:46.80]This could be, like, fucking fun.
[15:50.54]Ugh.
[15:53.64]I have to do this, unfortunately.
[15:57.96]This game, see, I could probably have fun with this game, but, like, I have to drop it to, like, 60 hertz or something.
[16:02.25]Because it just ain't gonna fucking happen.
[16:07.94]Like 60 Hertz.
[16:09.78]We gotta run this shit on medium.
[16:11.36]You know what I mean?
[16:12.34]This is not my fault.
[16:13.58]This is not my fault.
[16:14.38]Remember that.
[16:17.46]Yeah, yeah.
[16:18.02]Restart the fucking game.
[16:22.26]It's not my fault.
[16:27.90]Bad PC.
[16:29.97]Blame the bad PC.
[16:34.80]No, it's just when OBS pulls it, it doesn't want to work.
[16:38.38]Whoa!
[16:39.32]Jesus, man!
[16:40.26]The fucking nuke just went off in my ears.
[16:43.54]Why?
[16:43.96]Let's try it again with it dropped to medium.
[16:53.85]The Lord only knows, no games like to be captured ever.
[16:59.15]Anyways, uh...
[17:04.16]Thank you, uh, and Obiki for your... No, that's still fucked up.
[17:12.51]I can, like, fucking feel it already.
[17:21.69]This is... That's unfortunate.
[17:26.78]I'm gonna see if I can stand it.
[17:29.52]What are nuggets of truth?
[17:30.52]I don't know.
[17:34.65]I'll do 1600 by 900.
[17:44.12]You know, it might have something to do with changing the FOV.
[17:47.32]What a crock of shit.
[17:50.98]But can we stand it?
[17:52.94]Gunning down enemies fills your concentration bar in Q. Yeah.
[17:59.53]This is fucking cool too.
[18:00.73]This is like fun to play.
[18:07.58]Nah, I don't know if I can stand this shit.
[18:09.68]I don't know if I can handle this.
[18:11.48]Bullshit!
[18:12.38]Oh, the same thing every FPS has.
[18:15.64]Just like walking up and shooting him in the face.
[18:39.67]Next.
[18:42.65]I mean, I could load up gun.
[18:45.21]But, ugh.
[18:46.95]I wanted to, like, play this game.
[18:51.11]Just go play Borderlands.
[18:52.51]But there's, like, a skill tree.
[18:56.57]Absolute crap.
[18:58.83]I just can't get pulled through OBS.
[19:03.00]I mean, I could try to, like... I'm gonna set, like, the process affinity or something.
[19:06.28]Hold on.
[19:08.05]Let me try one last trick up my sleeve.
[19:10.03]I'm gonna, like, put this process thing to, like, high.
[19:12.63]See if I, like, break my whole fucking computer.
[19:20.44]How do you do that shit?
[19:22.86]Isn't there a way to do that?
[19:28.76]Resource values, disk, memory, no.
[19:31.62]No.
[19:39.85]Now... Right click on it and set it.
[19:48.56]I'm on Windows 10, man.
[19:50.22]That doesn't exist here.
[19:52.64]All that exists is like resource values and nothing else.
[19:55.10]I can't do like process affinity.
[19:56.46]How do you do that on Windows 10?
[20:04.85]There it is.
[20:05.25]Okay.
[20:06.53]Process affinity.
[20:08.09]Hi!
[20:09.14]Below normal?
[20:10.59]What the fuck is this shit?
[20:14.47]Put it on high.
[20:15.79]Change pro- what the hell?
[20:16.69]Why is it on below normal?
[20:20.63]What the hell is that?
[20:24.65]Yeah, we're gonna, you know, just run this at below normal.
[20:27.30]Alright, let's see if that helped.
[20:38.04]Uh, let's see.
[20:40.19]Holy shit.
[20:41.25]I think that may have actually done it.
[20:43.41]I think we've done it.
[20:45.97]Alright, one point available.
[20:46.99]Let's see.
[20:47.39]Long distance trapper.
[20:48.64]Close quarters.
[20:50.14]Let's be sniper, man.
[20:53.98]Iron sights.
[20:55.02]Okay, I think we did it.
[20:57.66]Eagle eye.
[20:58.16]Iron sight slows down time.
[20:59.50]Take your time in aiming.
[21:00.16]When you aim a long or one-handed weapon, you get a fraction of concentration like slowdown, just enough to aim precisely.
[21:08.79]Fucking dumb.
[21:09.61]What is this one?
[21:11.75]Oh, a sword and shield.
[21:14.95]You can't be bulletproof, but you can be more resistant.
[21:16.99]On average, every fourth enemy bullet shot from a shot weapon would bounce off of you.
[21:19.99]Okay.
[21:21.76]No, we don't want this game to work.
[21:24.38]Why?
[21:25.08]It's, like, kind of fun.
[21:26.96]Gunslinger, dual-wield.
[21:28.84]Dual-wield revolvers.
[21:32.66]Oh, this is, like, cool.
[21:33.58]What else?
[21:34.00]Snakes?
[21:35.92]Hmm.
[21:39.71]Put the graphics back up now.
[21:40.79]Yeah, I could do that.
[21:42.09]Why would I put the process below normal?
[21:47.47]I think I'm going to do Ranger.
[21:49.11]I want to be like a sniper.
[21:51.80]Quick fingers.
[21:55.14]Rifle ammo.
[21:56.24]Truth seeking.
[21:58.18]I could fucking truth serum people.
[22:01.04]Let's do it.
[22:01.88]Let's do sniping.
[22:04.13]I'm going for it.
[22:07.73]Why don't you guys vote?
[22:10.12]What do you think?
[22:10.86]What do you guys vote?
[22:11.42]Why don't you guys vote for like the fucking 45 minutes we're going to be playing this game?
[22:14.36]Alright, you got Ranger, Trapper, or Gunslinger.
[22:20.67]Let's do it.
[22:21.37]Put up a poll.
[22:22.85]Can one of the mods... I can't like alt tab right now.
[22:25.47]I'm terrified to.
[22:27.25]Throw... I can't leave until I pick one.
[22:33.78]And this poll is going to last for 10 fucking seconds.
[22:36.44]Because we got to get going, man.
[22:37.52]Like I got to start... Like I got to get going.
[22:46.77]I've seen a lot of guns.
[22:47.97]No one wants Trapper.
[22:48.75]Why?
[22:49.83]Is Trapper just like a piece of shit?
[22:56.99]Alright.
[22:59.01]It's a 50-50 at this point.
[23:00.13]Here we go.
[23:03.07]We're going to do 1, 2, 3, 4.
[23:03.51]And that's how we decide.
[23:04.01]You know how 1, 2, 3, 4 works?
[23:04.83]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[23:05.15]And it's Gunslinger.
[23:05.89]No, hold on.
[23:06.19]That's not fair.
[23:06.53]Eeny, meeny.
[23:16.00]one two three four catch a four by the four if he hollers let him go out goes why oh you my mother told me to pick the very best one and that one is you I promise you I guarantee you sir you have no chance you have no chance ranger eagle eye alright
[23:45.03]And all that.
[23:46.26]It didn't even fix shit.
[23:49.72]Perfect.
[23:55.08]How do I break stuff?
[23:56.02]God damn it.
[23:57.06]Ugh.
[23:57.30]Why?
[23:57.38]Maybe it reverted.
[23:57.96]No way.
[23:58.44]I refuse to believe that.
[24:18.92]No way that it fucking reverted.
[24:21.76]Details.
[24:24.54]Set priority.
[24:25.70]It reverted!
[24:29.59]Why did it revert?
[24:32.69]Do I have to keep this shit open?
[24:37.69]It actually did revert.
[24:38.67]Did it revert again?
[24:40.09]I think it reverted again.
[24:49.24]Let's see, did it revert again?
[24:53.19]Yeah.
[24:54.61]It will not fucking sa- It keeps reverting to below normal.
[25:00.51]Fucking task manager.
[25:01.75]Like, how do I save it?
[25:03.57]How do I make it so it won't revert back?
[25:11.59]Disable a bunch of cores.
[25:13.81]I have to restart the PC.
[25:15.39]Apply.
[25:15.81]There is no apply.
[25:16.81]Oh my god.
[25:20.77]I wonder what joke he has with this many problems.
[25:22.57]There is no joke.
[25:25.13]Here's what we're going to do.
[25:25.91]I'm going to set the... This is my last shot here.
[25:28.71]Real time.
[25:29.53]Change the fucking priority.
[25:31.87]Quit.
[25:32.33]Exit the fucking game.
[25:36.61]This is my last ditch effort.
[25:37.77]And then we're going to... I have to switch games.
[25:39.75]I have to.
[25:40.09]There comes a loud noise.
[25:47.51]Loud noise.
[25:47.91]Loud noise.
[25:48.29]Loud noise.
[25:48.63]I'm sorry.
[25:48.99]Take your earphones out.
[25:57.11]Okay, let's see.
[25:59.15]Priority below normal.
[26:05.71]I just want to play a game that I want to play.
[26:10.63]What the fuck is happening?
[26:13.85]Not that loud?
[26:14.65]Oh, maybe that's because I had it turned down.
[26:16.14]Alright, I can't.
[26:18.40]It's going to be unbearable the whole time.
[26:23.10]I don't know what is going on.
[26:24.52]I don't know why.
[26:27.24]uh but for some reason for some reason set the priority while it's open do not that's what I'm doing the game's open right now like every time I I take my hand off the screen
