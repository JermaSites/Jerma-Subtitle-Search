[ve:61.1.100]

[01:39.90]Why, hello there.
[01:42.56]How are you?
[01:45.16]It is wonderful to see you.
[02:00.56]Only five minutes late, but you know.
[02:05.97]A lot of moving parts.
[02:07.51]I did say last night that I wasn't sure if this was going to go until, you know, we're going to wait for at least enough of the teams to be here.
[02:18.86]I'm going to get confirmation that we're going to be pretty close.
[02:23.61]There are rules.
[02:26.79]I'm going to be a stickler.
[02:37.63]Yeah, give me a few minutes.
[02:40.04]We will get this rolling and I will do an intro.
[02:43.88]I'm so excited.
[03:53.31]Good afternoon.
[03:56.46]Great to see you again.
[03:57.84]Great to see everybody, of course.
[04:02.65]Welcome to the House Flipper, House Flipper 2 Invitational 3.
[04:08.78]My name is President of the HOA, Jeremy Elbertson.
[04:12.96]Glad to have everybody here.
[04:16.17]President and Chairman of the HOA, by the way, the Streamer HOA.
[04:21.44]so we've got a lot of people here there are I think there's 22 out of 24 people let's check in see how people are doing hello how are you so so good man it's so good oh let me turn this down welcome thanks for coming everybody
[04:47.65]I do have to say, it's swell to have everybody here.
[04:50.59]I think most people are actually here on time.
[04:52.96]This is unbelievable.
[04:57.60]Hi, Jerma!
[04:59.20]What's up?
[05:00.74]How you doing?
[05:02.03]Oh, that was Ludwig.
[05:03.01]Okay, I was like, who was that?
[05:05.23]That was me.
[05:06.07]Hi, Jerma.
[05:06.69]Hi, guys.
[05:07.65]Please avert your eyes to the screen.
[05:11.66]I don't know if you have my stream up or not, but I want you to take a look.
[05:14.42]This is very, very cool.
[05:15.26]Holly made this.
[05:18.26]Here is the neighborhood.
[05:22.79]This is the map of the neighborhood.
[05:24.53]The theme of today is the neighborhood.
[05:28.32]Whoa, okay.
[05:31.15]wait this is adorable wait I love it oh that is cute couple terrorists on my block though alright but anyways where you see yourself here that is who you are going to be going against in round one round one I will reiterate is a 2v2 building at the same time across a property line from your opponent and yes you are probably seeing double Joel
[06:00.25]Joel had to take over the double role.
[06:03.81]It's alright.
[06:04.40]It's going to be great.
[06:06.02]It's going to be awesome.
[06:07.91]Joel and Joel.
[06:08.67]Joel and Joel 2.
[06:09.55]Yes.
[06:12.02]Yes.
[06:12.26]You're a great sport, Joel.
[06:13.08]Thanks.
[06:14.29]But yeah, welcome.
[06:15.25]And here's the deal.
[06:16.83]I have a couple things to say to those of you that have been maybe seen this stream before.
[06:22.76]This first round is going to be a little different.
[06:26.34]And what I mean by that is you've seen probably people make a tower.
[06:32.37]You've probably seen people make big, crazy, elaborate things.
[06:35.33]I don't think anybody in the two years we've done this has made a fucking bathroom with a door on it.
[06:44.02]I'm not sure any of you have made a singular bedroom.
[06:49.37]So as the president... I did have the futuristic pooping toilet, though.
[06:52.77]You did.
[06:53.61]A little bit.
[06:54.17]The entire thing was a bathroom.
[06:56.92]Thank you.
[06:58.46]Can we make a bathroom with cameras in it?
[07:01.26]I think that would be ill-advised.
[07:03.31]I know everyone be pooping.
[07:05.67]Yeah, it's fine.
[07:07.13]Everybody poops.
[07:08.21]So, your task, if you'd like to continue to be part of the neighborhood, remember, I'm the president of the HOA.
[07:14.53]I expect in this first round, you are competing for a lot.
[07:19.57]You see that you share a lot with somebody right now.
[07:22.12]You have a divider in the middle.
[07:24.38]You have not a huge amount of room, but you have enough room to impress me as the president of the HOA.
[07:31.09]I expect from this first round, remember, whoever doesn't impress me with their home, not only does not... Under what?
[07:38.42]What's that?
[07:39.92]Under pineapple... You said pineapple what?
[07:42.34]Ina Cove suburbs.
[07:43.38]It's like on the page that where you made your Oh, did you guys get dragged up?
[07:47.47]Jerva was doing a routine.
[07:50.55]What do you mean routine?
[07:51.73]I'm the president and chairman of the board.
[07:56.06]Hold on a second.
[07:57.88]Who said that?
[07:58.80]Which one of you fucking people said that?
[08:00.71]Ray was bullying me for being the smallest streamer here in the other room.
[08:04.05]It was really uncomfortable.
[08:05.29]I'm not gonna lie.
[08:06.25]Mark that down.
[08:07.74]I am speaking put those chips down immediately uh excuse me is there any chance we could get lower dues this month it's re it's getting ridiculous no it's 55 000 a month to live in this community I'm sorry
[08:31.80]yeah I'm sorry that's just the way it is easy money easy money I don't make the rules I just I'm just the one that I'm the president and I'm the one that collects the checks so and they go into my bank account so yeah anyways as I was saying as your streamer hoa president I expect you to make a dream home that is the deal no memes
[08:55.76]Well, I will allow some memes.
[08:58.23]But there is not going to be custom content allowed in round one.
[09:03.83]You understand?
[09:04.39]So if you want to put a picture of my ass up on the side panel of your bathroom, ain't gonna fly.
[09:10.50]You cannot stop me.
[09:12.72]What if I don't know art at all?
[09:15.37]You're against art?
[09:17.25]You can place it, but the way that the co-op real time works, in round one, I will not be able to see it.
[09:25.63]I expect curbside appeal.
[09:29.37]I expect a nice backyard.
[09:33.52]And you can interpret that however you want.
[09:35.40]You can make whatever you want.
[09:37.30]And if you put custom content down there, I'm going to have to open your stream to see it, at least in this first round.
[09:44.33]Can I ask a question?
[09:45.53]Sure.
[09:46.62]What does curbside peel mean?
[09:49.36]Curbside appeal.
[09:51.30]Oh, appeal.
[09:52.08]Okay, sorry.
[09:52.82]I wasn't listening.
[09:55.77]Who just did that?
[09:58.39]That's Will.
[10:00.48]That brings me to my next question.
[10:02.34]Are we able to walk you through our property?
[10:05.59]Absolutely.
[10:06.81]I'm a song and dance man.
[10:08.77]I got a little bit of a song and dance coming out of here.
[10:11.46]So very important now that we have pretty much everybody here.
[10:14.49]Listen.
[10:15.45]Sorry, I got really angry for a second.
[10:16.67]I don't know why.
[10:18.16]When you open... Don't do this.
[10:19.98]Listen before you do anything, please.
[10:22.05]I know a lot of you read the rules, but maybe some of you didn't.
[10:24.61]When you open up the multiplayer, the co-op menu, somebody has to host this.
[10:31.36]So whoever is the host, you have... Take a look at the infographic again.
[10:37.29]Whoever is the host... Oh, there we go.
[10:42.67]Of the four people on each lot, one person has to host the game.
[10:47.47]that person should have the map file that I put there if you don't it's super simple I put it already in the uh in the in the channel here in the info channel grab it dump it in your sandbox folder there's instructions on how you do that and where that is it's just a simple divider in the middle somebody has to host the game that person
[11:07.47]whoever that is, and you can determine who that is amongst yourselves here when we finish here, that person needs to be responsible for not leaving the game.
[11:16.94]They cannot leave the game.
[11:18.81]Because when the timer is done, which by the way, you have one hour.
[11:23.03]I'm giving a little bit extra time this year, specifically because we have a lot of new people here that may not have played the game very much.
[11:29.82]Maybe you have, maybe you haven't.
[11:31.56]And I want you to make something smooth.
[11:35.23]So, whoever is hosting the game, you cannot leave the game.
[11:39.66]At the end of the timer, when I start doing the tours, somebody from the opposite team that's not giving a tour will need to drop group so I can join the lobby.
[11:51.58]Same thing on the other side.
[11:53.54]It just can't be the host.
[11:55.18]So, same thing on the other side.
[11:56.49]I plan on doing both properties...
[11:59.46]Pretty much at the same time, because I'm going to see the curb.
[12:02.85]I'm going to see both houses, because both houses are going to be there in view.
[12:07.39]And remember, you're fighting for staying in the neighborhood, because, oh boy, listen to this reveal.
[12:14.58]Oh my, this is, Jerma, this is fucked up.
[12:17.27]Somebody said that.
[12:18.15]I think I heard somebody say that.
[12:20.29]Whoever does not have the better house.
[12:23.96]Jerma, this is fucked up.
[12:25.20]There we are.
[12:26.68]you will be eliminated your team is going to be eliminated wow there are a shitload of you this time uh and last year in the year before uh sometimes this stream tends to go very long so uh seven to eight hour stream with 14 to 16 people a 24 person event would take like three days
[12:51.25]So whoever, whatever team does not make it through this round, I'm sorry, but that is where your journey will end in the neighborhood.
[12:59.62]So you're saying that we really need some curbside peel?
[13:02.30]We need some curbside peel.
[13:04.20]Alright, cool, cool, cool.
[13:05.89]What does that mean?
[13:06.83]Alright, well, just remember, you are free to do whatever you want.
[13:09.79]Whatever you want.
[13:10.67]You can make whatever you want, but remember you're competing directly with your neighbors, which you will be able to see in real time.
[13:16.38]And I encourage, very much so,
[13:20.16]will have chat channels over there you see that's a game one room one game one room two if you want to jump over and talk a bunch of that is absolutely up to you I would just say don't harass your neighbors indefinitely uh supreme chancellor of the hoa I have a question absolutely
[13:39.23]What are the rules on crossing the fence?
[13:41.75]Are we allowed to do that?
[13:43.05]Because if not, couldn't I build some kind of massive wall to obscure their view from what I'm doing on my side of the fence?
[13:50.95]Whatever you want to do on your side of the fence is completely and totally your right to do so.
[13:57.10]Thank you.
[13:57.84]You cannot go over.
[13:59.34]Because I know my opponents, Ludwig and Squeets, they're both kind of famous for cheating.
[14:05.08]So I'm taking the steps I need to protect my intellectual property.
[14:09.41]Sorry, let me just hop in for a minute.
[14:10.63]Keep my name out your mouth.
[14:11.71]Thank you.
[14:12.63]Also, let me hop in one more time, too.
[14:14.92]I have a question.
[14:16.12]I have a question.
[14:16.52]Real quick, though, Ludwig and Squeaks are going against Valkyrie and Sinnoh.
[14:20.89]So, Will, you might have a different opponent in the first round here.
[14:23.15]I mean, they're already going to be out.
[14:24.72]Rent-free, I guess, Will.
[14:26.12]Wait, wait, wait.
[14:26.68]No, game one is Ludwig and Squeaks.
[14:28.36]We got free rent here?
[14:29.12]It's good property value.
[14:30.67]Free rent each way?
[14:32.15]Can we build in Will's mind?
[14:35.69]Wait, the information in the mailbox is different.
[14:38.15]It says Ludwig.
[14:38.78]It is.
[14:40.08]So here's the problem.
[14:41.54]Why didn't you look at the graphic that Holly made?
[14:43.62]Here's the issue.
[14:44.72]We had to move a little bit of moving around.
[14:47.38]First of all, I got to say thank you very much, Ludwig.
[14:49.27]You're here.
[14:49.57]Thanks, Ludwig.
[14:50.11]Thanks, Cutie.
[14:50.95]Thank you, Stans.
[14:51.67]Thank you, Criken.
[14:53.27]Doug, Doug, anybody that was here that was kind of the last like four or five days where I'm like, hey, I need like four, five, six, eight, I need four or five people.
[15:01.14]uh that thank you so much it's jumbled around a little bit but um really appreciate it ludwig recruited us and asin and I have never played I just installed it I'm freaking yeah alright wait actually it's weird it's so weird that one asked the two people who have never played
[15:16.87]Alright.
[15:17.57]Hold on.
[15:17.91]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15:19.35]Should we do a, should we do a little pivot here?
[15:21.89]Should we, should we, because Lubricant Squeaks have a lot of experience.
[15:25.60]Should, okay.
[15:26.50]I kind of want to go head to head with them just because I feel like they're going to lose.
[15:30.05]Hey, but hey, keep in mind, this is really important.
[15:32.61]The rules in this round are, they have to follow the rules.
[15:35.47]And I know they're like, oh, we're going to make this crazy thing.
[15:37.34]We're going to do like a bunch of crazy custom stuff.
[15:39.40]They have to follow the HOA rules just like everybody else does.
[15:43.23]Well, Jerma, I'm a team player.
[15:44.45]I think Squeaks is too.
[15:45.31]So if you want to put us against Will and QT, we can do that.
[15:47.69]Whatever you're feeling.
[15:49.75]Grand Wizard of the HOA, Jerma, can we please still go against QT and Will?
[16:00.24]Because I want to smash their faces with interior design and decorating.
[16:05.81]I'm glad you pivoted in the middle of that because this is a nonviolent stream.
[16:10.14]It's just House Flipper.
[16:11.18]It's not fucking Valorant.
[16:13.25]It's okay.
[16:15.55]I have a concern.
[16:17.29]I'm afraid my partner has no design sense.
[16:20.25]What do I do about that?
[16:21.29]Well, if your partner has absolutely no design sense, what you can do is you can designate them to builder.
[16:26.06]And what that means is you come up with all the shit, you come up with all the good stuff, and you say, hey, I want you to build that wall right there.
[16:31.37]I want you to dig down there.
[16:32.25]I want you to add that there.
[16:33.55]Very important.
[16:34.49]Very important.
[16:35.07]I'm going to give an insanely quick tutorial.
[16:38.15]Very quick tutorial.
[16:39.16]This one problem here.
[16:40.28]What happens if you yourself, I.e.
[16:43.68]your partner, can't do anything?
[16:46.93]Okay, well, Joel, that's a great question.
[16:49.09]If you are your own partner, let's just use that as a scenario.
[16:53.68]Right, hypothetically, yeah.
[16:56.50]It would never happen, but... It would absolutely never happen.
[16:58.40]But if you are your own partner, which, again, would never happen, I would say that you get to design and execute on whatever philosophy you want to do.
[17:06.77]And by the way, very important before we get started, the four pillars of the home spirit are going to be your grading system.
[17:14.76]The last couple of years we did this,
[17:16.73]It was, okay, you're going to have a B, A, C, B, right?
[17:21.38]Different grades.
[17:22.64]Grading is out the window.
[17:24.70]I am going to use that internally.
[17:26.41]Remember, we got a lot of people here.
[17:27.83]There's a lot of places to get through.
[17:29.79]I don't want this to be a 14-hour stream.
[17:31.63]Otherwise, I think all of you will kill me.
[17:33.88]So how we're going to do it is like this.
[17:36.58]The four pillars of the home spirit.
[17:39.05]And they are, say it with me.
[17:42.36]creativity creativity creativity complexity complexity philosophy philosophy philosophy and philanthropy and that's good too philanthropy
[18:01.28]And structural integrity.
[18:04.04]Cilantro.
[18:04.93]And structural integrity.
[18:08.33]And a little bit of cilantro on top.
[18:10.27]One is just going to be thrown out.
[18:11.50]Cilantro.
[18:12.36]Oh, really?
[18:12.80]Okay.
[18:13.84]I thought I heard that.
[18:14.56]My bad.
[18:15.22]Okay.
[18:16.04]So thank you all for coming, everybody.
[18:17.51]I love cilantro.
[18:18.63]It's a lot.
[18:21.21]I said I wasn't going to scream.
[18:23.05]Yeah, where does the curb appeal come in?
[18:24.41]Oh, curb appeal is you have a lawn.
[18:26.09]Like a structural pillar?
[18:27.10]You have a lawn.
[18:27.76]I thought it was peel.
[18:29.60]Everybody's got a lawn.
[18:30.84]Peel's here.
[18:33.20]A curb appeal is what it looks like on the, what does it look like on the outside?
[18:38.33]That's what a curb appeal is.
[18:39.95]Is there an HOA mandated maximum length for grass blades as part of this particular thing?
[18:46.56]I expect you to just do what you please.
[18:50.19]And I'm going to interpret that the way it is.
[18:51.55]Remember, no custom images doesn't mean you can't make whatever you really feel like making.
[18:56.78]Alright.
[18:57.84]Quick question.
[18:58.42]Can I just do a check just for how many of us are actually based in Europe and are prepared to be up till 4 a.m.
[19:04.39]potentially tonight?
[19:08.20]Be born somewhere else.
[19:11.52]The previous year winning has gone to RC's head, clearly.
[19:15.07]He thinks he's going to win the first round.
[19:17.07]No, no, I'm not.
[19:20.07]Hey, don't rule out Sark and Stu, alright?
[19:23.06]I heard they were practicing.
[19:24.74]We're coming for that ass, our team.
[19:27.85]I was just checking who's in Europe.
[19:30.47]Alright.
[19:30.71]Alright.
[19:31.65]At this point, we got to get rolling here.
[19:34.52]It's been about 15, 20 minutes.
[19:35.78]This is how long.
[19:36.60]I have to give you a quick tutorial.
[19:38.12]Listen, everybody, if you don't know, especially listen how this is going to... Who the fuck?
[19:44.55]I thought my house exploded.
[19:45.71]I thought my house exploded.
[19:48.40]Alright, clear comms.
[19:51.12]Listen, I seriously thought my house exploded.
[19:54.41]Um, you fucked up my whole train of thought.
[19:56.33]What was I going to say?
[19:56.99]Oh, listen, okay.
[19:57.97]Shit, okay.
[19:58.64]Here we go.
[19:59.12]This is important.
[20:00.86]When you, whoever the host is, the file that I dropped, you are hosting that.
[20:05.90]That is technically your map.
[20:09.37]Everybody else is not going to have an opportunity to save that map.
[20:12.17]Whoever the host is of this four-person game, you are the quarterback.
[20:16.44]This needs to be somebody responsible.
[20:18.22]This needs to be somebody that has...
[20:20.36]intuition I mean not really but you have to be responsible for this map what that means is you can't leave and you have to save the game also important whoever the host is you need to shut that beep me up the beep me up so bad okay the host there was something that's really important mods help me what was the other thing there was something really important about it
[20:45.79]Oh, yes, okay, of course.
[20:47.60]Over in the chat, in the channels right now, in, I would like for you to now, of the people on this graphic, find out beforehand who the host is.
[20:57.94]Really important.
[20:59.56]When you click on multiplayer host, whoever that is, don't show your screen.
[21:05.21]Don't show your screen.
[21:06.69]Don't show your screen.
[21:08.31]Don't show your screen.
[21:09.70]I'm going to say it a thousand times.
[21:11.83]Show the screen.
[21:12.97]The lobby code, unless you did the streamer mode thing, one of the devs posted how to use the console command.
[21:18.68]If you didn't do that, you are going to have a lobby code.
[21:21.89]Whoever that person is, don't show that lobby code.
[21:25.03]Anybody on Earth could just use it and join your game.
[21:28.38]Oh, no.
[21:29.10]That's bad.
[21:30.08]On Earth?
[21:30.82]I would say on Earth, even in outer space.
[21:32.70]Living or dead, or both.
[21:34.66]thank god I'm on the moon what if the person who joins has really strong design sense I would say you could kick them out immediately they need to be kicked immediately they could be it could be somebody it could be like a host of hgtv I don't care who this is okay kick the host of hgtv got it got it
[21:59.52]Alright, so don't leak the lobby code.
[22:01.42]That lobby code is how people join.
[22:02.79]When people are in, make sure you select the right one.
[22:05.27]And you are not going to go until I say.
[22:08.55]You have one hour building together at the same time of the person across the lot from you.
[22:15.14]Be good.
[22:16.43]Be good to each other.
[22:18.07]Have a fun time.
[22:19.71]That's what it's all about.
[22:20.57]It's a whole event.
[22:21.45]By the way, this event is sponsored, by the way, so don't fuck this up for me.
[22:26.52]Shit.
[22:27.54]Sir, yes, sir.
[22:28.40]By the way, can we fucking swear on this sponsor?
[22:31.91]You can do whatever the fuck you want.
[22:33.41]It's the House Flipper team.
[22:35.05]The House Flipper team is awesome.
[22:36.40]They're involved.
[22:37.96]I'm doing some other stuff with them later in the next month or two, probably.
[22:41.30]But there's no constraints.
[22:43.13]Have fun.
[22:43.63]Do whatever the fuck you want.
[22:44.85]We're just here to have a good time.

[24:33.46]What the hell was that?
[24:34.38]Did like a hurricane just go through Joel's house?
[24:37.33]No, it wasn't even me, man.
[24:39.17]I think it was Landre.
[24:41.32]He tried to use tools.
[24:43.46]Alright, so Joel.
[24:48.19]And Joel.
[24:49.21]Joel, are you both here?
[24:52.46]Yes, but the cataclysmic biblical fucking disadvantage I have here is catastrophic, but I'm still going to get that ass, okay?
[25:02.89]Hey, Joel, Joel, Joel.
[25:04.96]Let me tell you.
[25:05.90]Don't yell at me, man.
[25:07.52]Hey, I'm about to give you a bunch of props.
[25:10.21]Congratulations on not only you're the team, you're the duo alone.
[25:14.86]But, hey, I have confidence you're a very smart, very creative guy.
[25:19.16]I think you're going to fucking knock it out of the park.
[25:21.27]You don't have to lie to me.
[25:22.61]Stop propping him up.
[25:23.61]I'm with Point Crow.
[25:24.37]That's a disadvantage.
[25:25.60]If anything, I should get points.
[25:27.26]What?
[25:27.78]What?
[25:28.16]Is that actually a disadvantage?
[25:29.83]I mean.
[25:31.80]Alright.
[25:32.02]Yep.
[25:32.44]Point.
[25:33.50]Doug, Point Crow and Joel go over there.
[25:35.99]By the way, Joel is EU.
[25:37.55]So good luck with the fucking lag you guys are going to have over there.
[25:43.84]Now, good luck.
[25:44.78]Head over to the game for room a figure out who's going to be the host.
[25:50.05]Get that ass, Jerma!
[25:51.97]Oh shit, I forgot to say something wicked important.
[25:54.16]When you make the game, make sure you have... Everybody has to make sure they have cross-play off or on.
[26:00.31]But just have everybody have cross-play off.
[26:02.09]They'll figure it out.
[26:02.77]They've played multiplayer games before.
[26:06.33]When you host the game, it's like, oh, do you want cross-play enabled?
[26:09.38]Just make sure everybody says off, even the people that are joining.
[26:12.02]So we want to relay that to everybody.
[26:16.31]Yeah, it must be off.
[26:17.07]Everybody has to have it on or everybody has to have it off?
[26:21.15]Alright, we got two more teams.
[26:22.65]What?
[26:23.12]That seems really important.
[26:25.68]They'll figure it out.
[26:27.48]You guys have played multiplayer games before.
[26:28.99]Fuck everybody.
[26:31.57]But thanks for coming.
[26:33.25]Alright, we got the next team.
[26:34.96]We've got CDawg and IronMouse and Snuffy and Limealicious.
[26:41.17]I don't want to play favorites.
[26:45.70]I'm not playing favorites.
[26:46.68]What I did, I made a whole team of all my favorites to make sure I couldn't pick between them.
[26:51.82]There's a friend team over there to make sure I have to win.
[26:55.39]Does that mean we're all going to win?
[26:56.61]I think you guys are going to have a great match.
[26:58.45]I'm really looking forward to what you guys do.
[27:00.29]That's a scary block.
[27:01.60]We're all winners in our hearts or some bullshit like that.
[27:04.10]Yeah.
[27:05.62]Do I need my tab key?
[27:07.35]Because my tab key's been broken.
[27:08.85]You definitely need it.
[27:11.77]Somebody on your team needs a tab key because they need to place furniture and shit.
[27:14.78]The entire menu is in that.
[27:19.45]All the furniture, all the decorations.
[27:21.81]Head over to Game 5.
[27:23.79]Game 5, Room A. Figure out who's going to be the host.
[27:26.58]Remember, the host cannot leave.
[27:31.12]Take care.
[27:31.50]Thanks for coming.
[27:32.88]And that leaves the last team, which is not the last team because it's all happening concurrently, but the last group that I'm going through right here.
[27:38.79]You're actually on the front of the street, by the way, this group here.
[27:41.82]RT and Criken, you guys are both here.
[27:44.80]Let's go.
[27:45.64]And then Sark and Stu.
[27:46.63]What up, Criken?
[27:47.09]What up, RT?
[27:48.47]What up?
[27:49.25]What's up?
[27:49.81]Yo, how's it going?
[27:51.02]Head over to game six, room A, and get yourself situated.
[27:55.47]And we're going to get confirmation that everybody is ready.
[27:58.32]And then I'm going to put the timer on the screen, which I'm going to anyways right now.
[28:02.77]Wait, is the time starting now?
[28:04.03]No, no, no, no, no.
[28:04.97]We might need a minute to set up the server.
[28:06.56]No, no, no, no, no.
[28:07.62]The timer is on.
[28:08.84]I'm going to put the timer on.
[28:09.94]Go, go, go.
[28:10.38]No, the timer is on the screen.
[28:11.82]I'm already sweating.
[28:12.62]Stay over there.
[28:12.98]Stay over there.
[28:13.68]Give me six roommates.
[28:14.43]Sorry.
[28:14.85]Alright.
[28:15.11]Take care.
[28:15.55]Go figure it out.
[28:16.47]And don't show the lobby code or I'm going to be very mad.
[28:18.77]Goodbye.
[28:27.44]Whew.
[28:29.14]Easier said a Google timer.
[28:30.22]Who gives a shit?
[28:34.36]Yeah, I'm using a Google timer.
[28:36.08]You got a problem?
[28:42.03]Alright, let me make sure that you can see the game because I'm just going to get in the game and I'm just going to mess around.
[28:50.38]I'm so looking forward to this.
[28:51.36]This is going to be a lot of fun.
[28:52.52]It's going to be great.
[28:55.76]Hey, look at that.
[28:56.78]Let me just get this up.
[28:59.47]Uh-huh.
[28:59.63]Make sure you can see.
[29:01.39]I don't want to spoil it too much, though.
[29:05.31]I don't think I can spoil it.
[29:06.11]No, okay.
[29:06.59]So if you're curious, this is the map that they're going to be on.
[29:09.02]You've probably already seen it.
[29:10.92]Shit!
[29:12.16]Okay, they all... Oh, goddammit, I forgot to say this.
[29:15.01]Hey, everybody, whoever the host is, you have to go to edit property, not play.
[29:19.88]Edit property, not play.
[29:20.82]If you've made a game, remake it.
[29:22.54]Everybody select edit property.
[29:25.11]Edit property if you're the host.
[29:26.85]I'm going to just run over to every game and just say it.
[29:33.32]It depends on what I'm doing that day.
[29:35.87]Whoever the host is, you must select edit property, not play.
[29:40.38]Everybody, edit property, not play property when you select the one from that list, the one that I sent you.
[29:45.52]Jerma, would you come to my funeral?
[29:47.25]Absolutely.
[29:48.25]Thank you.
[29:49.05]Appreciate that.
[29:49.75]Edit property, not play.
[29:51.39]Heard, chef, heard.
[29:53.02]Big, excuse me, incredible important thing.
[29:55.58]Whoever's hosting the game needs to be edit property, not play.
[29:58.56]Edit property, not play.
[30:00.71]If you haven't selected that, make sure it is.
[30:02.35]Sandbox mode, edit.
[30:02.81]Sandbox mode, edit property, not play.
[30:04.83]Edit.
[30:05.63]Got it.
[30:07.76]Hello.
[30:08.14]Quickly, just going to scream over everybody, potentially, hopefully not.
[30:10.98]Whoever the host is, I forgot to say this.
[30:13.02]Edit property, not play.
[30:14.70]You need to select edit property because that makes you put it into creative mode, not play.
[30:18.05]I read the rules.
[30:19.01]I read the rules, Jeremy.
[30:20.89]I'm ready.
[30:21.83]Alright.
[30:23.51]I read I read all of it I read all of it through chat gpt audiobook style I'm pretty sure I got most of it alright cutie we're on this other side hey real quick whoever the host is edit property not play you need to select edit property not play very important yes with that guy yeah get out of here huh yeah it's incredibly important edit property not play if you're hosting health bar are you saying that I can't read
[30:49.70]I am... Is this the implication here?
[30:52.67]Did everybody do this?
[30:55.65]Am I just overriding the ping?
[30:56.75]Get out of here!
[30:57.93]Alright.
[30:58.96]You may have already done this, but whoever the host is... Sorry, I'm jumping around.
[31:03.38]If you were the host, you must say edit property, not play.
[31:07.43]Not play.
[31:08.15]Edit property.
[31:09.35]Alright.
[31:09.62]Good.
[31:10.58]Thank you.
[31:11.82]Can I ask a question really quick, though?
[31:13.56]Absolutely, you can.
[31:14.30]You know, with the streamer mode, I typed streamer mode and now it just says streamer mode true.
[31:18.59]Does that mean it's already enabled by saying that it's untrue?
[31:21.52]It will.
[31:22.00]The one thing I will say is just make sure you copy the thing.
[31:24.50]You will just be careful not to show the lobby code because you can copy the thing.
[31:29.09]You can copy it.
[31:30.03]I don't think you reveal it if you copy it.
[31:31.61]It sounds so chaotic when you're explaining anything.
[31:33.90]Sound chaotic one sentence.
[31:36.58]Yeah.
[31:38.02]Yeah, sorry.
[31:39.56]Sorry Cross play in the most Like a neurotic I posted the code for you guys in the in this voice He's like the president of the HOA you should be sucking up Add that to a deduction on your philosophy score
[32:00.15]You're incredible.
[32:01.48]You're amazing.
[32:02.78]You're fantastic.
[32:03.22]You're very cool.
[32:04.26]If you clicked edit, you're good.
[32:05.81]But if you hit play, make sure you remake the lobby.
[32:07.71]I think you already did it.
[32:09.51]I'm so sorry about that.
[32:10.72]We're so fucked.
[32:11.46]Yeah.
[32:11.82]Talking about it behind my back.
[32:13.06]Okay.
[32:13.26]Didn't even know I was in the room.
[32:15.53]Are we doing cross-platform?
[32:16.51]I'll let you know.
[32:16.91]I don't.
[32:17.11]Cross-platform off.
[32:17.91]Just make sure everybody selects off.
[32:19.29]Okay.
[32:20.30]Okie doke.
[32:21.06]I'm joining.
[32:21.99]Everybody has to select off when they're joining, and the host has to select off too.
[32:27.03]Everybody has to be matched up.
[32:29.84]Where does it say edit or play?
[32:32.28]I need to change my connection region, I guess, because I'm in Europe.
[32:36.75]Yeah, so when you select, when you go to co-op mode, you go to host, you're going to have a thing that says sandbox mode.
[32:44.36]And you click sandbox mode, then it'll be there, then you say edit.
[32:48.55]What region did you set it to?
[32:50.13]Or what region are you on, Snuffy?
[32:51.82]Good luck, guys.
[32:52.22]I'm going to remake the room really quick, but you want me to set it to something that might be better?
[32:58.47]Okay.
[32:58.59]Real quick.
[32:58.87]They called it a mine.
[33:00.45]Real quick, guys.
[33:01.33]You probably did it.
[33:02.79]The info panel, whoever is the host, make sure you selected edit on the sandbox mode and not play.
[33:11.79]Whoever the host is.
[33:13.93]Right.
[33:14.93]Same box mode.
[33:16.35]And when you select the property, that divider property, make sure you say edit instead of play before you start them out.
[33:22.68]Where's the edit button?
[33:23.86]I see the play button.
[33:24.52]I don't see the edit button.
[33:25.66]I think it's after the play button.
[33:27.00]I think you push play and then there's a second.
[33:29.89]Yeah, it'll be like, oh, play or edit.
[33:32.89]Alright.
[33:33.99]Oh, it's loading.
[33:35.35]Oh, okay.
[33:36.29]I'm almost ready.
[33:37.41]It's loading.
[33:38.35]Okay.
[33:41.13]Okay.
[33:42.74]Okay.
[33:43.54]Edit property.
[33:44.88]That's so funny.
[33:45.54]I go in there and he's like, oh, he completely explains things so convolutedly.
[33:48.91]It's like, oh, I'm right here.
[33:49.93]You know that, don't you?
[33:51.69]It's like the teacher is in the classroom and you didn't know that.
[33:55.68]The teacher was like behind like a door or something.
[33:57.88]And it was like, oh, what's that student?
[33:59.04]What happened?
[34:00.41]He's a little neurotic.
[34:02.72]I mean, we got 24 people here and we got a whole info panel.
[34:06.34]Did people read it?
[34:07.08]Did they not?
[34:07.52]I don't know.
[34:08.04]I don't know.
[34:08.36]I can't go to each individual person and say, hey, did you read the fucking notes?
[34:12.29]So we're good.
[34:13.09]Everything's good.
[34:16.10]Should they be up or down?
[34:17.04]I'm going to puke if I have these on for too long.
[34:22.91]Does that telephone next to you work?
[34:25.51]Of course it does.
[34:28.35]Substitute teacher Andy.
[34:33.72]Alright, so, uh, I think we're pretty, we're going to be pretty much ready to go here.
[34:41.83]I'm very curious.
[34:42.49]I'm going to be jumping around, probably to look at some streams very early on.
[34:45.27]You have one hour.
[34:46.01]How are we doing?
[34:47.58]Is everybody pretty much ready?
[34:53.77]Is everybody good to go?
[34:55.87]Give it another minute or two.
[34:59.42]You look like a middle school gym teacher.
[35:05.37]You look like you would sue somebody over a fly in your soup.
[35:10.64]Okay.
[35:13.30]Let me lower this so people can see.
[35:15.08]So this is what they have to build on.
[35:16.35]This is what they're working with.
[35:18.19]Are we still waiting for the go signal?
[35:20.01]We are.
[35:20.49]Is everybody good?
[35:21.81]Because we're about to start.
[35:23.67]I don't know that.
[35:24.15]I'm going to go back to my room and be a good contestant.
[35:26.06]Okay.
[35:29.20]Let me get in the mod channel here.
[35:30.62]Is everybody good to go?
[35:31.38]I'm going to start this in 10 seconds.
[35:37.47]We good?
[35:38.27]How's everybody's stream looking?
[35:39.03]Everybody ready?
[35:46.42]We good?
[35:53.15]In 30, 29, 28.
[35:57.66]I know they can't hear me, but there's a lot of rooms here.
[35:59.93]I think we're ready to go.
[36:04.76]Ladies and gentlemen, the House Flipper Invitational 3 is now officially begun.

[36:38.89]And the two people on this side.
[36:40.46]They cannot go over the fence.
[36:42.40]They can hop around and talk about stuff if they want.
[36:53.21]Oh my god, they actually have to build a house.
[36:54.65]They do.
[36:57.99]You look like John Arbuckle.
[36:58.97]John, this does not go all the way down.
[37:01.24]Alright, so here, here's the thing.
[37:03.18]If people need, I don't know if we can relay this to people.
[37:05.52]If people need help with like tools, I can help.

[41:17.04]And do you have one particularly that you enjoy?
[41:19.10]I tell you, my favorite sandwich is Dream Home in a Neighborhood.
[41:22.97]That's probably my favorite sandwich.
[41:25.55]Oh, I see.
[41:26.93]He let slip, that fool.
[41:30.24]Okay, so I guess a lobster roll.
[41:34.54]recently on my trip to Jesus Christ was New York City.
[41:38.75]No, you saw last time.
[41:40.55]Oh, absolutely.
[41:41.21]Yeah.
[41:41.90]But I went to White Castle.
[41:42.96]I had fucking deep fried clams or oysters at 2 a.m.
[41:45.94]for DoorDash, which was great.
[41:48.55]Oh, boy.
[41:49.75]You had DoorDash oysters.
[41:51.57]I mean, so serious, dude.
[41:52.93]I do that all the time.
[41:54.75]You like both of you are revolting people just legitimately.
[41:59.40]wait I've never you're now my favorite person I've ever met nobody else's door dashed oysters and like I've ever met in my entire life I do this well the problem is like when I ate him it was like in a random hotel lobby right and I couldn't really sit down either so I was just scarfing it down like an animal right and um
[42:16.38]Yeah, but you know, deep fried oysters, why not?
[42:17.84]You know, I'm Swedish.
[42:18.62]I eat raw fish all the time and all that stuff.
[42:20.20]But generally when it comes to America, you know, shit, what do I enjoy the most?
[42:26.27]Well, New York City.
[42:27.73]What can I say about it?
[42:28.55]I mean, I love the pizza, which is, you know.
[42:31.80]I'm muted.
[42:32.50]The best part about this is they're supposed to be competing neighbors.
[42:34.74]What do I love about America?
[42:36.49]Just like hanging out and talking.
[42:37.27]I love the fact.
[42:37.83]They're building, right?
[42:38.67]Are they building?
[42:40.05]Americans will make fun of my internet.
[42:42.94]and say LMAO, EU Internet, yet we are chugging like it's fucking 1997.
[42:46.98]What if they're not building?
[42:48.75]They're just really good neighbors.
[42:52.35]I do love that all the Italian-Americans I know... What looks weird?
[43:01.70]This door.
[43:04.19]Okay, we'll pick the Heaven and Hell door.
[43:09.81]I'm really bad at roofs.
[43:10.70]That's my weak point.
[43:11.78]I'll be real.
[43:13.16]How do I make the lawn look pretty?
[43:15.75]I just have a fucking spy network.
[43:18.65]Mowing grass quick.
[43:22.11]Right height.
[43:23.56]Everyone's good.
[43:24.20]Okay.
[43:24.48]I think everyone's good to go.
[43:26.56]Okay.
[43:26.80]Let's pop this here.
[43:30.08]Do you know if Jerma has seen one of the... I'm just screaming.
[43:33.89]I didn't hear anything.
[43:34.61]I'm screaming.
[43:35.23]I didn't hear anything.
[43:35.79]I'm screaming.
[43:36.29]I'm screaming.
[43:36.71]I'm screaming.
[43:37.13]I'm screaming.
[43:37.61]I'm screaming.
[43:37.93]I'm getting out.
[43:38.31]I'm getting out.
[43:38.69]I didn't hear anything.
[43:39.53]I didn't hear anything.
[43:40.56]I literally did not hear anything.
[43:43.76]Alright, everyone's good?
[43:48.66]Go check on Squeaks.
[43:50.04]Is Squeaks alright?
[43:53.35]Here's the thing.
[43:55.21]I'm going to leave this up to you guys for chat, right?
[43:58.35]I don't want to know what people are doing, but I want to... Should I open up their streams and just speak?
[44:04.92]I feel like I shouldn't do that.
[44:08.60]I feel like I shouldn't do it.
[44:14.33]Alright, so let me give an example of what I would say is my dream home in a neighborhood.
[44:19.86]It's my favorite sandwich.
[44:20.88]It's my favorite time of year.
[44:24.05]It's my favorite... I'm just letting them interpret that however they want.
[44:35.74]I love the questions so far.
[44:37.08]I'm here for them.
[44:37.98]If people have a... There's no question that's not... There's no stupid question.
[44:43.60]No stupid question.
[44:45.88]If you want to know, hey, like, how do you paint a wall?
[44:49.38]Like, there are very specific things to know.
[44:53.09]If, by the way, those of you that jump around that are watching a lot of these streams, kind of in real time here, if somebody is having like a ton of problems, like, how do you do this?
[45:01.68]How do you do that?
[45:02.76]Definitely like tell them to come ask or help them out.
[45:06.41]You guys can help them out too.
[45:07.71]For instance, painting, right?
[45:09.81]Very important.
[45:11.72]This surface finishes tool
[45:14.75]is how you do everything on any surface.
[45:18.73]So for instance, I have this selected.
[45:20.27]This is for you guys to go help wherever you're watching.
[45:23.52]You hit Q with that selected.
[45:26.32]That opens up this page here.
[45:28.30]Here is the materials.
[45:30.73]That material can be literally anything.
[45:33.91]You've got paint, you've got outside, you've got concrete, materials, anything, wallpaper, it goes on any surface.
[45:42.32]Let's say I want this wall paper pattern to be on the floor of my house.
[45:46.63]Okay, that's great.
[45:47.25]I've selected it.
[45:48.27]You can change the colors of it.
[45:49.39]You can do a lot of interesting things besides, obviously, the custom stuff.
[45:52.71]All it is then, you just paint it on.
[45:55.25]There is a whole system in the regular mode where you actually have to paint the wall.
[46:00.72]You've seen it a million times, right?
[46:03.60]You need to do it like that.
[46:05.41]Again, because it's a very, very quick turnaround.
[46:07.61]One hour goes by quick.
[46:08.43]It's already been 10 minutes.
[46:10.13]Jerma Jerma I I need help absolutely absolutely what can I do for you I built I built a roof and the remove wall tool doesn't remove the roof yep okay so uh hit right click go to your architect tool the architect tool is going to can sell the roof it also if you hit r you can change the style of the roof you can you click on it after change style you can change the color you can change how it looks yeah yeah that that's your cell tool oh wait so what I just

[46:46.70]Architect tool.
[46:47.90]And you can sell the roof with that architect tool.
[46:52.39]oh that oh this thing oh my god that's very tough also too very important too uh you remember how to do certain surface finishes right with you any floor any wall you don't buy it in the store tab is the store right but you just right click surface finishes cue that's how you get everything and you can paint your walls you can paint your floors you can paint everything with that it's you're you're effectively painting a material it's not like building a stone
[47:18.49]On that, Jeremiah, because that's the question I was going to ask.
[47:21.33]I'm trying to apply carpet to anything.
[47:23.78]I don't understand how to do it.
[47:25.20]Okay, so right-click, go to surface finishes.
[47:30.08]Oh, I did not remember the right-click thing.
[47:31.81]Yeah, your right-click menu, that architect tool does a lot of stuff.
[47:35.21]The transform tool does a lot of stuff.
[47:37.35]The surface finishes is literally every single thing that could be on a wall or a ground.
[47:43.22]And then when you have that open, you hit Q, and you have all the materials in the whole game.
[47:48.38]And it can go on any surface.
[47:49.68]Hold Q to... I'm still... Yeah, so hit Q, click on material.
[47:55.45]And if you're talking about like a carpet... Yeah.
[47:58.57]There is... There's a carpet.
[48:00.35]One of these is carpets.
[48:02.53]What tab is it in?
[48:03.44]It's one of the tabs up on the top is carpeting.
[48:06.64]Which one is it?
[48:07.76]Okay, I think I've at least figured out enough for this.
[48:11.83]It's like its own thing.
[48:13.41]Oh, okay.
[48:13.81]The very last tab on that menu is carpeting.
[48:17.10]It's fluffy carpet, suede, suede, poplin, burlap.
[48:20.78]There's like a whole section of carpet on the right, all the way to the top right.
[48:24.37]Okay.
[48:24.71]So press Q to use that tool and then... Yeah.
[48:28.35]Go to surface finishes.
[48:29.89]Right click to surface finishes and then... Okay, got it.
[48:31.80]And then Q and then everything else.
[48:33.12]Yep.
[48:34.00]Cool.
[48:34.22]Thanks, Jeremy.
[48:37.20]This is what I'm here for, right?
[48:39.35]Like this is what I'm here for.
[48:44.77]You good?
[48:45.11]Can I go?
[48:46.00]Um, you are free to go.
[48:49.78]Okay, thank you.
[48:54.59]I fucking love these guys.
[48:55.39]Everyone's so funny.
[49:02.03]You look like a DIY salesman.
[49:03.73]Wait, what does that even mean?
[49:07.35]Have they all started?
[49:08.35]I believe they have.
[49:09.84]If they haven't, you know, I might just, I might bump five more minutes out of the clock.
[49:14.04]Like I feel like people needed a few minutes.
[49:18.63]Do you like a mattress salesman?
[49:20.07]And I would sell every mattress in that store.
[49:30.77]Joel has no partner, which means there's no one holding him back.
[49:40.58]Uh, poor Joel.
[49:42.92]He's he, I think he's, I think he'll be good though.
[49:46.02]I don't know what he's doing.
[49:46.91]I, the last time I checked over there, they would just be neighbors hanging out, which is, that's so wonderful.
[49:50.91]That's so encouraged.
[49:53.23]I said, talk shit to people, go over there and harass your neighbor and like talk some shit.
[49:58.54]He went over there and they're talking about lobster rolls and his, you know, when he visited America or something, they're having, he's being a good neighbor.
[50:13.67]You look like the Quaker Oats guy, yassified.
[50:22.88]Oh my god.
[50:27.97]Is the Quaker Oats guy in a blue shirt?
[50:34.82]Yeah, you know what?
[50:35.40]Here's what I'm going to do.
[50:37.04]I'm the president of the HOA.
[50:55.35]Yeah, it's me.
[50:58.29]Yeah, you're watching, too?
[51:01.62]Yeah, it took him like 15 minutes to even know how to use the paint tool.
[51:05.94]Right.
[51:06.46]Yeah.
[51:09.97]Okay.
[51:13.03]Well, you can take that up with whoever you want to take that up with, but remember, I'm the president of the HOA.
[51:19.24]The rest of you are board members.
[51:21.14]Don't forget that.
[51:24.82]Right.
[51:26.23]Okay.
[51:28.37]Okay, that's fine.
[51:29.20]You can take it up with whoever you want to take it up with.
[51:30.46]I'm adding five minutes.
[51:31.62]Go fuck yourself.
[51:35.96]So, I have decided, with the board's approval, I'm going to be adding five minutes to the timer.
[51:52.80]I already did it.
[51:57.20]They can.
[51:58.24]They listen to me.
[52:00.24]Okay.
[52:01.92]Yes, we have a board.
[52:02.94]Yes, there's eight of us on the board.
[52:04.97]I'm the chairman.
[52:05.79]I'm the president and the CEO of that board.
[52:08.85]So if I decide that I want to add a little bit of time, I can.
[52:20.32]You forgot to tell Mr. Sark to start.
[52:23.86]What?
[52:24.52]Yeah, it did.
[52:25.88]Let me check in on them.
[52:26.42]Let me see how they're doing.
[52:27.46]I'm going to try to do, but we're not going to be a spy.
[52:33.99]Hello, neighbors.
[52:34.99]How are we?
[52:35.80]I'm just checking in.
[52:37.68]Hey, Mr. President.
[52:38.88]Mr. President.
[52:39.78]Thank you for stopping by.
[52:40.62]Thank you.
[52:41.00]Thank you.
[52:41.68]And that's how, I love that's how I'm addressed.
[52:44.01]You know what?
[52:45.11]I think that's a little bit of points on the HOA there.
[52:48.05]Appreciate that.
[52:49.68]A lot of respect.
[52:50.76]How's things going out there in Neighborhoodville?
[52:53.05]Going very wonderful.
[52:53.90]Do you want to check and see how you guys are doing?
[52:56.54]You guys got started, right?
[52:57.34]You guys good?
[52:58.44]We're good.
[52:59.04]We're good.
[52:59.52]Thank you for the five minutes.
[53:00.70]Very generous of you.
[53:02.06]Benevolent HOA leader.
[53:04.55]Thank you.
[53:05.55]Thank you so much.
[53:06.17]You're so kind.
[53:07.89]I thought for sure he was going to say, what the fuck are you talking about?
[53:11.01]No, I appreciate that.
[53:12.13]As the president of the HOA, I mean, it's nice to hear the people see what you do and see how you're doing.
[53:17.86]And we think you do a wonderful job.
[53:20.93]We think you do a wonderful job.
[53:24.14]We think, above all, that you're a very trustworthy member of this community.
[53:29.89]It's important to us.
[53:30.86]Didn't like the laugh after that, though.
[53:33.06]Yes.
[53:33.80]We know that...
[53:37.62]We know that you can be cool.
[53:39.24]That's really important to us.
[53:40.93]Cool guy.
[53:41.23]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[53:41.93]Cool guy.
[53:43.19]I have an opportunity to be a little cool.
[53:46.30]I am very strict, though, and I play by the rules.
[53:48.36]But I'm a little cool, I could say.
[53:51.63]Alright, dude.
[53:52.51]Stu, you hear that?
[53:53.55]Yeah.
[53:53.89]Listen, I'm hearing it.
[53:55.09]He's fun after hours.
[53:56.94]He can let it loose a little bit when he needs to.
[53:58.96]But he can be firm.
[54:00.22]He can be a little.
[54:01.04]You know, you could keep things in line.
[54:02.63]But after 5 o'clock, I see you.
[54:04.95]I had a couple weeks ago at an Edward the HOA board dinner, I had a cocktail.
[54:11.38]And it was a fun time.
[54:14.82]He's our guy, Stu.
[54:15.98]I told you.
[54:17.13]May I ask what you had?
[54:19.01]I don't know what it was.
[54:20.27]The host of the party just made it.
[54:21.95]I wasn't sure.
[54:22.71]But it tasted, it was very, very fruity and very sugary and very wonderful.
[54:26.36]It was like a sugary drink.
[54:28.20]I liked it a lot.
[54:29.73]Oh, so you like sugary drinks.
[54:31.39]Okay.
[54:31.91]Okay.
[54:32.18]Noted.
[54:32.66]Noted.
[54:34.30]Oh, no.
[54:34.76]What have I done?
[54:35.50]Good to know.
[54:36.16]Alright.

[54:54.05]Snuffy needs help.
[54:56.05]Where are we?
[54:56.49]Where are we?
[54:56.91]Where are we?
[54:57.19]Where are we?
[54:57.65]What team are we in here?
[55:05.38]It tried to kill everything.
[55:08.01]I am here.
[55:08.89]How are you?
[55:09.65]I'm here to check in.
[55:10.39]I see that there might be a little bit of help that's needed.
[55:12.27]How are we doing?
[55:13.49]I almost crashed the game with a rock.
[55:15.53]I really want to know I swear I had done this before but I was using the roof tool and it usually just makes it kind of like that orange tile and you can use the surface tool to customize like the outside of it but for some reason when I was trying to use it it wasn't highly wait wait now it is let me give you let me give you a hand here the roof it the roof is the architect tool so on the hit right click
[55:40.96]architect tool you're going to press r and you have change style that's how you change the roof then you can go in and you can change a bunch of stuff you can change the color of the roof and the style of the roof it's all in there
[55:55.86]that's cool okay thank you so much yeah is there a way to make the uh rotation more precise so like it obviously snaps to angles right now is there like a hotkey I can press so that it's like so there is based or is that it there is so if you hit right click you go in the top row there transform tool the transform tool lets you kind of pick up anything and if you hit q oh
[56:18.19]You can go to, I believe it's fishing rod, and you can kind of pick it up.
[56:21.87]You can pick up pretty much any item and hold control, change the rotation.
[56:26.60]You can move it around.
[56:27.48]You can snap it, hold it in place, freeze it in place.
[56:30.43]You can change if something has collision or not.
[56:33.91]It's all in the transform tool.
[56:36.27]That's cool.
[56:36.95]Thank you.
[56:37.70]Yep.
[56:39.06]You got anything else?
[56:39.62]You guys good?
[56:40.50]We're at the 45 minute mark, by the way.
[56:42.32]I think that's good.
[56:43.18]Yeah.
[56:43.80]Oh, God.
[56:44.51]We're doing great.
[56:45.09]We're doing good.
[56:45.73]We're doing good.
[56:46.47]Yeah.
[56:47.29]Very good.
[56:48.97]Alright.
[56:49.31]Good luck.
[56:50.13]Thank you.
[56:57.78]Best Buy employee.
[56:58.88]Look, I'm glad you guys have content over here.
[57:01.98]Your content over here is like, how do we make up a bunch of guys that he looks like today?
[57:06.71]I'm actually really, you know, that's perfect for me.
[57:09.63]That's great.
[57:10.25]Keep it going.
[57:12.77]That's my content today is what, what employee from what store does he look like?
[57:23.75]What the hell happened?
[57:28.52]Oh, shit.
[57:29.02]That's kind of cool.
[57:30.50]I wonder if anybody's going to utilize that.
[57:35.79]Are these prop glasses?
[57:36.83]No, these are real prescription glasses.
[57:38.39]And every time I put them up, I feel like I'm going to throw up.
[57:45.67]So I can't wear those.
[57:53.95]You're like Robin Williams from One Hour Photo.
[57:56.56]Guys, just keep them coming.
[57:57.58]I mean, might as well.
[57:59.54]Might as well type into Google, movie or TV show with guy with blue polo on.
[58:06.59]And you guys will find one.
[58:12.72]Pop out the lenses so you can... I'm not going to break my prescription glasses.
[58:16.00]These things are kind of expensive.
[58:19.50]Alright, we're at the 40.
[58:20.40]Yeah, it's 43 minutes left.
[58:22.71]I'm glad.
[58:23.77]Now I am so happy.
[58:25.15]Originally, this was 40 minutes.
[58:27.66]Go help Ludwig.
[58:28.40]Is Ludwig going to need help?
[58:30.62]Ludwig need help?
[58:34.89]Yes, yes, yes.
[58:36.07]Okay.
[58:37.88]I'm here for it.
[58:44.22]Gentlemen, I heard you might need some help.
[58:46.43]Are you guys doing alright?
[58:47.89]Yeah, we are neighbors through pizza all over our property.
[58:51.20]So we were just wondering if there's a some sort of repercussion, perhaps, or a way to remove the pizza, maybe a service we can hire.
[58:59.70]I first of all, I am disgusted by this.
[59:01.88]First of all, I am repulsed by that.
[59:04.56]Thank you for your disgust.
[59:05.78]We really appreciate our... We are also disgust.
[59:08.40]Yeah, there is a... There is a way to remove trash.
[59:13.55]If you go to... If you go to your architect tool, which is you right-click, go to architect tool, you should be able to... Yeah, architect, make sure you hit R, sell item, and just hover over it.
[59:25.89]You should be able to sell it.
[59:28.37]If you can't, then you should also be able to go into dirt management...
[59:33.53]and be able to destroy dirt.
[59:37.90]Where's dirt management?
[59:39.64]Right click, bottom row, dirt management.
[59:42.65]So that's the one with the squeegee.
[59:44.17]Connor!
[59:45.45]What's up?
[59:45.97]What's up, baby?
[59:47.11]What's up, baby?
[59:48.26]Oh, shit.
[59:48.74]I love that.
[59:49.20]I sold Maya's tree.
[59:50.80]The neighbors are all together here.
[59:52.96]This is great.
[59:53.56]Everyone's having fun.
[59:54.47]Everyone's talking to each other.
[59:55.29]It's wonderful.
[59:56.63]I do have a question, boss.
[59:58.23]Absolutely.
[59:59.59]I've made a roof and I'm unable to paint the roof or separate the sides of the roof that I paint so it's all just changing architect tool like a side right click architect tool you're going to hit r this is change style is what you're looking for aim it at the roof that will be you can do color you can do material you can do style you can change the roof however you want
[60:22.45]Can I do it half and half?
[60:23.67]Is that possible or no?
[60:24.84]You would need to build two roof sections.
[60:28.94]Yeah.
[60:29.10]Can I ask how much time is remaining?
[60:30.76]There is 40 minutes remaining.
[60:32.72]Okay.
[60:33.01]Alright.
[60:33.23]Thank you very much.
[60:34.17]Thank you very much.
[60:35.19]Thank you.
[60:35.51]I figured it out.
[60:36.15]Thank you so much.
[60:37.21]Take care.
[60:41.13]I'm in the mod channel right now.
[60:42.42]How are we doing?
[60:42.82]Everything good?
[60:45.70]Yeah, we have a house.
[60:48.02]It's...
[60:49.67]By the way, the mods are making a house too.
[60:52.34]I want to check in on it near the end of the stream and see what they make.
[60:58.88]You guys are making a house and helping out with all this shit.
[61:03.95]You guys are doing double time here.
[61:09.44]I'll just say when you look at the house, you'll see how busy we've been.
[61:15.62]It's inspired by our work.
[61:18.85]Alright, cool.
[61:19.47]I'll see you guys later.
[61:24.75]Hey, you ever going to show the Infinity Nikki outfits again?
[61:30.46]Dude, I don't know.
[61:32.12]You know what today is?
[61:36.77]Today is the House Flipper Invitational 3.
[61:38.97]Volume 3.
[61:43.49]Sponsored by House Flipper team.
[61:46.34]Are you guys fucking paying attention today?
[61:52.57]I'm so excited.
[61:53.51]I... I cannot wait to see what people are doing.
[61:55.95]I can't... There's a lot of fun stuff that's going to happen today.
[61:58.03]I'm looking so much forward to it.
[62:01.34]You look like Qui-Gon Jinn.
[62:03.66]That's fine.
[62:05.08]I wonder how many people are going to be flying around and realize that there's this.
[62:11.33]Do you know what I'm saying?
[62:13.76]I don't know.
[62:14.46]You can use the whole space.
[62:15.44]But what if they... I don't want to give anybody any ideas.
[62:20.33]Ahem.
[62:23.29]There is an underworld that you can build in.
[62:29.74]LOL, he does look like that.
[62:31.09]I'm glad you guys are keeping yourselves entertained.
[62:34.67]Yeah, the whole point is there's a lot of different broadcasts.
[62:37.20]I'm just very curious.
[62:38.28]I just want to see.
[62:39.88]I'm not going to click on any of the streams, but I am curious as to how many people are actually broadcasting this right now.
[62:50.26]What do we got for... Because I don't know if every single person is streaming it.
[63:02.78]Looks like a lot of people are streaming it.
[63:08.48]Very cool.
[63:09.59]Okay.
[63:10.23]Well, let's keep going.
[63:15.11]Alright.
[63:15.33]Let me at least put something together here.
[63:19.24]38 minutes.
[63:20.10]Under 40 minutes, this is where it gets tight.
[63:32.74]I'm watching five streams at a time and swapping between them.
[63:36.64]Yeah, that's the whole point of this whole day.
[63:40.13]That's the point is there are like 20 different streams going right now, probably.
[63:49.32]And the week of time or more, if you're into it and you want to see what people did and how their process went and even the before stuff, a lot of people were doing stuff before.
[64:00.29]I love that multi-monitor kind of content, multi-tab content.
[64:08.04]And the content's not even here right now, right?
[64:10.50]Like, I encourage you guys right now to go jump around.
[64:14.00]I'm the host of this, right?
[64:15.97]But all the content is... I'm making a big Christmas box of toys.
[64:29.38]Yeah, the whole point is to jump around and see what people are up to.
[64:34.95]I need something like cardboard.
[64:38.33]How's this look?
[64:42.73]It's just kind of like a wooden box, right?
[64:55.38]Worst Christmas ever.
[64:56.31]It's a box of bricks.
[64:58.07]I'm not done.
[65:03.29]Yeah, I'm keeping my eye out for any other questions or anything.
[65:07.27]Because I was thinking, like, maybe should I participate?
[65:09.81]I don't think so.
[65:10.45]I think being able to just sit here and answer any question, at least most of them.
[65:16.96]We do have somebody from the House Flipper team is also, I think, around if there's something really major to ask.
[65:25.13]But I'm here to just be a presence.
[65:30.78]No, this is like a weird wooden box.
[65:32.37]It's got to be darker.
[65:37.96]We'll just like this damaged wood.
[65:41.55]Oh, here we go.
[65:42.05]This is kind of, here we go.
[65:42.77]This might more like it, maybe.
[65:50.08]That's a little too dirty.
[65:52.48]Is this too dirty?
[65:56.95]Eh.
[66:00.09]Hey, you're not very good at this.
[66:02.51]All of my brain power is being immediately available.
[66:08.74]for anything that happens here.
[66:12.27]We're at 35 minutes.
[66:14.01]We should probably give people a halfway kind of warning.
[66:19.64]I can just jump around.
[66:26.96]What are there for toys?
[66:31.24]Look at all these crisps.
[66:32.13]Oh, look at all these toys.
[66:39.69]How about wooden blocks?
[66:42.20]In the wooden... Okay, can you resize these?
[66:44.26]Maybe you can.
[66:51.17]I don't think you... A lot of stuff you can't resize.
[66:54.41]Some stuff you can.
[67:00.58]Ster needs help.
[67:01.38]Ster needs help.
[67:01.98]Ster needs help.
[67:02.71]You got it.
[67:03.27]I'm on my way.
[67:08.70]What's going on, guys?
[67:09.52]I heard you need some questions.
[67:10.70]What's going on?
[67:11.04]You good?
[67:12.59]Uh, no.
[67:14.49]We just were wondering how you're doing.
[67:16.97]Oh, everybody was telling me that Ster needs help.
[67:18.85]Ster needs help.
[67:19.41]Oh, they were just being assholes.
[67:20.39]Okay, I get it.
[67:22.44]Are you spying on us?
[67:23.58]Yeah, I mean, my chat is saying, like, 10 minutes left, 10 minutes left.
[67:26.76]Oh, no, they're full of shit.
[67:27.76]You guys have 33 minutes left.
[67:29.54]Yeah, but we started late, so we need, like, another 45.
[67:31.61]Have you looked at our thing yet or no?
[67:33.41]No, I haven't looked at anybody's.
[67:35.27]Okay, good.
[67:35.97]Are you building one?
[67:37.31]Me?
[67:37.89]Yeah, I got something going.
[67:42.48]So when you say you started late, how late did you start?
[67:46.60]Like five minutes.
[67:47.70]Hey, I got great news for you.
[67:49.31]I added five minutes to the clock already.
[67:51.67]Good.
[67:53.61]Oh.
[67:54.05]You're at about the halfway mark, though.
[67:55.51]33 minutes left.
[67:57.52]Sir, we got to finish this house walls.
[68:00.40]Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
[68:01.78]I'm on it.
[68:05.96]Senna needs help.
[68:08.06]I'm on it.
[68:13.45]I'm putting them there.
[68:14.77]That's actually perfect.
[68:15.99]You guys good?
[68:17.47]Oh, Dermot, it is amazing.
[68:19.68]Let me just tell you, you should really raise your expectations for how good we're doing, honestly.
[68:23.78]I'm talking like, think about your best map you've ever seen and double it.
[68:31.03]no raise them really high I have not looked at anybody's any houses yet I'm I'm gonna go in completely blind but uh I'm looking forward to it both of you gotta say thank you both of you so much because it this format really only worked with this exact amount of people so oh oh I just want you to know I literally only said yes to this for you
[68:54.05]Well, I mean it.
[68:56.00]This is so stressful.
[68:56.90]Me as well.
[68:58.30]I don't know how to plant trees.
[69:00.40]It's been a journey.
[69:01.14]It's been a journey.
[69:02.12]I can help for a little bit.
[69:02.88]I can help.
[69:04.05]I mean it when I say this, though.
[69:04.91]Thank you.
[69:05.53]It's a big help that you're here.
[69:07.21]Oh, of course.
[69:08.47]It's really fun.
[69:09.05]We're having a good time.
[69:09.91]We're having a wonderful time.
[69:10.87]It's been really funny.
[69:11.56]We threw pizza at Ludwig.
[69:12.70]It was great.
[69:13.38]I heard about that, and the HOA president was going to be a little upset about that, but I have determined that that is nullified.
[69:20.07]Is that illegal?
[69:21.76]I mean, here's the thing, Ludwig was, you know, he's Ludwig.
[69:24.99]You know what, honestly, and the fact that he called DHOA to vote something like that, I should take points away from him, right?
[69:32.88]I agree.
[69:33.43]Honestly, I agree.
[69:36.69]It really makes us the victims in this scenario, if I'm being honest.
[69:40.76]uh and if you hit tab and you're if you go to the store you have a huge amount of stuff obviously you've probably been there before oh yes I just discovered the store it's it's incredible so trees right here's the thing about the trees in this game if you pick like a big one you need to be looking straight down it's like why won't this go into if you look straight down it should clip to where uh where it's green uh sometimes it can be hard to do it but yeah yeah I just figured like literally just figured it out it was very difficult
[70:10.75]Yeah, this game is amazing, but it has like a little tiny learning curve.
[70:16.86]So if you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
[70:19.48]Okay.
[70:20.34]Oh, yeah.
[70:21.70]No, I'm in the groove now.
[70:23.30]Oh, I'm in the groove.
[70:25.69]Sounds awesome.
[70:26.71]I'm going to go check.
[70:27.45]Apparently, I have to put my Clark Kent glasses away.
[70:30.35]There's another person that needs help.
[70:32.09]Oh, okay.
[70:32.81]Just keep your standards low.
[70:34.90]Thank you.
[70:35.14]Thanks.
[70:35.32]Take care, guys.
[70:38.48]Yeah, we sure will.
[70:38.88]Fuck, oh, fuck.
[70:40.79]Alright, uh, Vinny needs help.
[70:47.96]Gentlemen.
[70:49.65]I heard that there is a question.
[70:53.66]Huh?
[70:53.98]You're asking it.
[70:55.90]Do you need help resizing things?
[70:57.91]Oh, yeah.
[70:58.74]Well, we didn't specifically ask for a question for help, but if you know how to resize objects, that would be like not shapes or architectural.
[71:08.00]Is there a way to resize like an item that's a physics object?
[71:12.23]Like a banana.
[71:13.09]Like a banana.
[71:14.25]Okay, so the transform tool, right-click transform, it's at the top row.
[71:20.74]If you hit Q, there's a resize, and you can ignore collision.
[71:24.92]A lot of stuff cannot be scaled.
[71:28.73]Like if you're talking about make it like make it big or smaller.
[71:35.11]But that is the tool to do it.
[71:37.18]Okay.
[71:37.80]See, I think that can only be used on like architectural pieces.
[71:41.98]I believe so.
[71:42.94]So yeah, if you want to make like a giant banana, like it actually, I don't think you can.
[71:47.85]Okay.
[71:48.17]Oh man, he knows about the giant banana.
[71:49.73]We got to do another thing.
[71:50.99]I might know about the banana.
[71:54.63]Alright.
[71:55.22]Well, I think we'll be okay.
[71:56.20]Thanks, man.
[71:56.72]We're at the halfway mark, by the way.
[71:58.55]It's 30 minutes left.
[72:01.55]Continue on.
[72:04.85]Good luck.
[72:05.47]Thank you so much.
[72:06.36]I'm going to try something here.
[72:11.12]That team is a team.
[72:12.08]I feel like they know what they're doing.
[72:14.65]When you ask resizing questions like that, I think that's going to be a pretty good house.
[72:19.29]Joel needs help.
[72:21.09]You got it.
[72:23.42]He's in.
[72:24.18]Joel's just in the room with them still.
[72:27.54]Is Joel just hanging out in their house?
[72:29.38]Hold on.
[72:29.86]I need to... Like, keep it a surprise for people.
[72:34.63]So they're like, where the fuck is Joel?
[72:35.95]I get you.
[72:37.13]I get you.
[72:37.65]I heard that there might be... Somebody need help in here?
[72:39.63]I heard that... Joel, you have a question?
[72:41.60]Somebody said Joel needs help.
[72:42.82]A lot of people said it.
[72:43.46]Are you good?
[72:44.36]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[72:45.68]I'm just here to, like, flex on it and say that I'm going to win.
[72:48.06]Oh.

[72:49.43]So you did the call... You called, phoned a friend to say you're going to win the million dollars thing?
[72:55.26]um I mean in this scenario it's more like like two pennies but hey I'm gonna get those benjamins eventually alright good luck you got we're at the halfway mark you guys have 28 minutes left oh only tell me when people need help okay
[73:20.24]Cinna and Ray need help placing flooring.

[73:26.89]Yes, I'm here.
[73:27.61]Who needs anybody's assistance?
[73:28.87]And it's like, no, dude, leave, leave us alone.
[73:32.14]Do we, do people, only people when people need help and they ask for it.
[73:42.13]He's the geek squad.
[73:44.92]Oh my God.
[73:49.62]How's the hair right now?
[73:50.60]It's in this ponytail.
[73:54.26]Superman can't be insecure.
[73:55.64]You have to go for it.
[74:02.37]I told everybody the theme, right?
[74:03.51]I said the theme was the neighborhood, your dream home in the neighborhood.
[74:05.91]I said that in the beginning, didn't I?
[74:13.08]Yeah, I did.
[74:14.14]I said it's your dream home in the neighborhood.
[74:17.84]You said nightmare home.
[74:19.13]No, I didn't.
[74:21.87]Dude, you just hit a box in 30 minutes and the invitational is named after you.
[74:25.79]Nice ego.
[74:29.50]I'm a little busy right now.
[74:31.64]What are you talking?
[74:39.41]I think I'm a little occupied.
[74:44.48]You didn't say it's the theme.
[74:45.92]Well, the theme is just the neighborhood.
[74:47.86]You're against your neighbor.
[74:50.85]It's just the neighborhood.
[74:51.65]And whoever I think has the better home in the neighborhood is going to move on from the HOA.
[74:57.68]It's the neighborhood.
[74:59.20]I wanted to leave it open.
[74:59.88]I want people to kind of do what they feel when they hear the neighborhood.
[75:02.93]Hey, Jeremiah.
[75:03.87]How's it going?
[75:05.08]How do I change the material of a roof on the outside of the roof?
[75:10.19]You got it.
[75:10.71]I have the paint roller tool.
[75:12.36]I'm looking at it.
[75:13.32]It's not letting me change it.
[75:15.10]Let me give you a tip.
[75:15.94]Alright.
[75:16.34]Right click.
[75:17.44]Go to architect tool.
[75:18.67]It's a different tool.
[75:19.39]Architect tool.
[75:20.61]Yes.
[75:20.79]You're going to hit R. Change style in the lower left.
[75:24.49]that gives you a huge amount of options on the roof you can do color you can do material oh wait these are the only materials we can do uh you can once you click it and you click material then you can go to I think some of them have a ton of options that's the first I I I'm very curious
[75:47.42]If you do, for instance, like steel roof, right?
[75:51.03]Yeah.
[75:51.51]Then there's, you can change the material, faded, drab, rich, pure, or whatever.
[75:56.21]Then there's a million colors.
[75:58.29]I think one of these materials cannot be changed.
[76:00.92]I think it's a default one.
[76:02.52]Okay.
[76:03.60]I've gotten what I need.
[76:05.70]Okay.
[76:06.78]Thank you for your help.
[76:08.49]25 minutes remain.
[76:11.51]Thank you.
[76:12.43]Good luck.
[76:21.02]Ster needs help rotating a wall.
[76:22.94]Ster needs help rotating a wall.
[76:25.95]Rotating a wall like this?
[76:27.37]I don't know if you can rotate a wall.
[76:29.53]I think you have to just like build it.
[76:33.64]Can you rotate a wall?
[76:39.93]I think a wall is a wall.
[76:42.63]He wants it to be diagonal.
[76:44.15]You might have to actually kind of do it.
[76:47.13]You figured it out?
[76:47.76]Okay.
[76:48.76]Ster needs help.
[76:49.32]He needs encouragement.
[76:52.17]He just found out he's smarter than you.
[76:55.58]Okay.
[77:00.25]Sina and Ray are skipping a floor because they can't figure it out.
[77:04.68]Try to go.
[77:07.24]Shit.
[77:07.88]Let me help them.
[77:08.36]Let me help them.
[77:09.21]Let me help them.
[77:09.77]I got to tell them how to make a floor, right?
[77:11.37]Let me help them.
[77:14.94]The HOA president is here to ask a quick little question.
[77:22.80]I heard that you guys might need help making a floor.
[77:31.37]I mean, what's a floor, you know, amongst friends really?
[77:34.20]I mean, if you were to do it, how would you do it?
[77:37.92]Our skin meets the dark.
[77:39.70]If I were to make a floor.
[77:41.03]It brings us back to reality.
[77:42.49]If I were to make a floor, I would pick the build wall tool and right click.
[77:48.12]And then I would click the ground and I would make a section and I would click twice after making the length.
[77:54.04]And I would click again on the ground after making the width.
[77:57.07]The wall is the floor tool.
[77:59.35]It's the every surface tool.
[78:04.01]Then that can be, if you go right click after doing that, surface finishes as well.
[78:10.22]Surface finishes means floor.
[78:12.06]It means wall.
[78:12.74]It means outside.
[78:13.45]It means it's any surface in the whole game.
[78:15.51]So if you have a floor now, if you hit right click and go to that second row, third on the surface finishes, then you hit Q.
[78:25.19]This will pull up every material in the whole game.
[78:28.01]Doesn't matter what it is.
[78:29.39]You just go through the tabs at the top and you want wood, you want carpet, you want paint.
[78:33.90]Then you click it, you hit escape and you just click and drag and you can put any material on any surface.
[78:43.46]Okay.
[78:45.05]I retain that information and I will do that exact thing.
[78:56.68]Alright.
[78:57.00]I'll say it again.
[78:58.49]I know it's a lot.
[78:59.29]It's a lot of info.
[79:01.35]Right click, build wall.
[79:04.67]On the floor, right?
[79:06.18]Yeah.
[79:06.66]Wall, instead of putting it up, go down on the ground.
[79:11.36]That is your foundation effectively.
[79:13.47]That's your floor.
[79:15.23]That floor is a surface.
[79:17.09]So if you have that down, press right click.
[79:20.02]Surface finishes.
[79:20.94]It's the paint roller.
[79:22.92]When you have that selected, the lower left is going to say, oh, look, here's the paint roller and here's something there.
[79:28.61]If you hit Q, Q opens up the broader surface tool.
[79:34.54]Material is the material it is, whether that's you click on that space where the square, you have a bunch of options.
[79:41.69]It could be anything.
[79:42.56]That floor could be like old stone blocks.
[79:46.38]It could be if you go to that tab, you could put wallpaper on the floor if you wanted to.
[79:51.61]So once you get one of those selected.
[79:55.06]Yeah.
[79:55.70]You click it and drag it around to where you want it and click again.
[79:59.91]Then it'll just kind of... Oh, okay.
[80:03.50]Hey, we got this.
[80:05.78]Don't even worry, Jerma.
[80:06.94]We will not let you down.
[80:07.84]I think you guys are going to have a great house.
[80:11.35]Thank you.
[80:12.01]I am actually looking forward to it.
[80:14.13]And don't worry about your neighbors.
[80:15.64]I don't know if they've been messing with you or not.
[80:18.68]No, I mean, they're just, you know, they're just a little...
[80:22.03]Like they walked in?
[80:23.49]No, they're locked in.
[80:24.69]Oh, oh.
[80:25.79]They won't even speak to us.
[80:27.40]What?
[80:28.58]Yeah.
[80:29.98]Their gig is sweating.
[80:31.58]Okay, well.
[80:33.65]Just a random hypothetical question, not applying obviously to our house, but like hypothetically if one was to add a floor and then the door now no longer opens because it's being blocked, what would one do?
[80:44.00]So that door, so you would go to the hand tool.
[80:49.70]And you would grab the door and move it and realign it to wherever you need to go.
[80:56.23]You also could sell it with the architect tool, which is right next to the hand tool.
[81:01.14]Okay.
[81:01.70]And remake the door.
[81:03.94]Okay.
[81:04.38]Awesome.
[81:04.80]Thank you.
[81:05.85]Okay.
[81:07.95]20 minutes.
[81:09.23]20 minutes left.
[81:11.07]Only 20?
[81:12.15]Only 20 minutes.
[81:13.14]And it's going to come down to the wire.
[81:16.62]Gotcha.
[81:17.04]Okay.
[81:17.70]Alright.
[81:18.62]Good luck.
[81:25.36]I can't wait to see these.
[81:29.43]I don't know what you guys are looking at, but... This is going to be great.
[81:36.80]Work ticket solved.
[81:38.24]Good job.
[81:39.12]Good job, Clark.
[81:49.30]I only made a box.
[81:50.36]What the fuck?
[81:50.86]How dare you?
[82:00.60]I have a question for those of you that wear glasses.
[82:02.30]How do you drink liquids with them?
[82:07.48]Well, I guess you don't wear them like this like a fucking weirdo.
[82:13.21]They're not up on my nose.
[82:14.55]These make me puke.
[82:24.32]I don't like how clear it is.
[82:25.41]I really don't.
[82:27.89]Tip your head back.
[82:39.63]Your prescription's too strong.
[82:41.29]I've said this before.
[82:42.05]I want glasses that are 720p, not 4K.
[82:46.62]I want a little bit of correction.
[82:48.24]I don't want 4K vision.
[82:49.78]I hate it.
[82:52.43]I actually asked the optometrist this.
[82:55.69]And she's just like... No.
[82:59.98]I was like, why?
[83:01.30]I'll pay for it.
[83:02.11]I just want 720p.
[83:04.79]I don't want it to be good.
[83:11.69]That's insane.
[83:12.43]I don't think that's insane.
[83:15.88]It's because you keep taking them off.
[83:17.76]Alright, well, we're getting down to the last 20 minutes of the House Slipper Invitational 3.
[83:24.55]Round one, the neighbors round.
[83:28.19]Am I doing good?
[83:29.09]Am I doing good?
[83:34.58]Wait, maybe we need some help somewhere.
[83:42.32]No?
[83:42.72]Everybody good?
[83:46.18]Mimes might need help with grass.
[83:47.63]Got it.
[83:52.69]Let me head over there.
[84:04.67]Quick question.
[84:05.33]I heard that somebody might have a grass question.
[84:07.93]Yeah, so we put the house down then changed where the house was going to be.
[84:11.62]But then like where the house has been, I can no longer regrow that grass with the grass tool.
[84:17.29]So it's like we've managed to weed kill it or something.
[84:19.96]It's dead.
[84:21.08]Interesting.
[84:21.48]So if you go to edit grass and you hit R and you click on like tidy or wild or it won't.
[84:27.93]yeah I hit wild and it worked for the front where I I manually removed the grass but where we where we put the house down it's like it's not feeling it interesting okay it's just dead so maybe if if it won't work could you just pretend the grass is wild there I absolutely envision wild grass thank you that's how you do it I I can't get it to do it on mine either let me see what if you do one first and then the other
[84:52.86]I think it is just, I think if you place down something there, it might be like permanently gone.
[85:00.09]Yeah, it's like we salted the ground or something.
[85:04.57]I think there is a land painting tool, which if you go to land painting, don't do this yet.
[85:11.44]Let me make sure this actually does it.
[85:13.21]What if I click just the regular kind of grass?
[85:20.06]Okay.
[85:20.48]No, that doesn't regrow the grass.
[85:21.88]I think the grass is just gone and less.
[85:24.18]Yeah.
[85:24.72]The grass I think might just be gone.
[85:26.89]Okay.
[85:27.43]Well, if we could ask you to just picture in your mind how beautifully glorious the grass is, that would be great.
[85:33.48]Josh is saying land hole, make a land hole.
[85:35.94]Then make a land, make, make a land hole.
[85:42.45]Okay.
[85:43.05]Then make a land.
[85:46.01]Okay.
[85:46.19]Then land painting maybe.
[85:53.57]Well, that's permanently gone.
[85:54.57]Alright.
[85:54.79]Well, don't make a land hole unless you plan on having a hole in your property.
[85:59.20]Okay.
[86:00.02]Oh, you press R to fill it in.
[86:01.74]Hold on.
[86:02.00]Fill it in now.
[86:02.68]Okay.
[86:04.44]If you go to land hole and then hit R, fill hole.
[86:10.73]It's still not there.
[86:11.61]Okay.
[86:12.37]Alright.
[86:12.59]Well, we'll just assume that there's beautiful wild grass there.
[86:15.31]Yes, it's beautiful.
[86:17.62]Yeah.
[86:17.86]Thank you.
[86:18.74]Alright.
[86:18.96]Good luck.
[86:20.02]Thank you.
[86:20.78]I'm very afraid of this.

[89:26.64]That was the number one theme.
[89:28.99]You're competing against your neighbors, and you're fighting for a spot in the neighborhood.
[89:34.89]I want people to interpret that.
[89:38.18]Dream home, dream landscape.
[89:41.16]I just wanted people to give a pretty open palette here.
[89:54.55]The loser gets their house bulldozed.

[91:15.34]Um...
[91:24.36]What block and mob is your favorite?
[91:27.64]I'm going to have to say... I do like the gold block.
[91:34.79]Not the gold block.
[91:35.85]I like the one with the gold bits in it.
[91:38.10]I like that one.
[91:39.78]And my favorite mob is probably the chicken.
[91:47.57]Alright, we got 10 minutes.
[91:50.79]Who is going to stay...
[91:55.29]Who will stay in the neighborhood?
[91:59.23]Here are your 24 competitors.
[92:03.62]Only 12 of them are going to move on.
[92:07.62]Who stays?
[92:09.14]Who goes?
[92:11.93]The streets are going to be smaller after this round.
[92:20.98]Give them an extra few minutes.
[92:24.26]Should I make the call?
[92:26.05]Should I make the call?
[92:28.09]Five more minutes?
[92:30.56]Nah, screw it.
[92:33.46]I'm seeing a lot of nos.
[92:38.79]Five minutes?
[92:44.16]How about this?
[92:44.58]I'll give them an extra two.

[93:03.48]I can make that call.
[93:04.22]They can have two minutes.
[93:10.05]Did the board approve of this?

[93:21.62]Contact the board?
[93:22.48]No.
[93:25.57]They can take it up with me later.
[93:33.47]I am the board.
[93:40.68]Chairman Palpatine.
[93:43.60]Why are you a demented Mr. Rogers?
[93:49.11]I haven't done anything.
[93:51.76]I didn't do anything.
[93:52.80]I've just been hanging out helping people.
[93:56.92]Now that I almost said I have to be demented.
[94:08.14]You look like the president of the HOA.
[94:11.73]Thank you.
[94:13.91]And let me tell you, when I took over the HOA, people started to bring their barrels up instead of leaving them out.
[94:22.46]We had heavy fines on that.
[94:25.34]We started making sure that all the houses were painted the same.
[94:28.61]Because I don't like the color green.
[94:30.97]And I made a very, very big point about that.
[94:33.41]That if you have even somewhat green around your house, that it cannot be there.
[94:43.21]I don't want that.
[94:44.51]What I have demanded, and I get my way because I'm the president of the board, gray houses, gray patios, gray cars, gray roofs, gray, everyone wears a gray shirt.
[95:02.45]Except for me, I wear the blue shirt because when I show up, I want to stand up.
[95:12.81]Can you give everybody another hour?
[95:14.23]No.
[95:19.44]Guys, we're going to be here for a while already.
[95:22.10]Another hour means we have to do this over three days.
[95:25.52]This is round one.
[95:27.71]Don't forget that.
[95:28.87]Round one.
[95:31.81]There's a lot more to do.
[95:35.56]This warm-up round is here to... Especially for that... Look, let me put it this way.
[95:40.68]If you're not familiar with the game...
[95:44.21]You know what I mean?
[95:44.97]Like, there's a lot of people that maybe their first time playing.
[95:47.44]I just want people to have fun and make houses in this first round.
[95:51.08]We're warming up with eliminations, though.
[95:52.71]Yes.
[95:53.35]I mean, we kind of have to.
[95:56.19]This would be a 10-hour event if we didn't.
[95:59.20]It's just, remember how long they went last year, the year before?
[96:02.64]And that was with, like, eight less people.
[96:09.33]Alright, we're getting close.
[96:10.85]I am so excited.
[96:17.73]What type of car do you drive?
[96:19.35]Gray.
[96:24.46]Hey, can Mr. Sark win, please?
[96:25.98]He's my favorite.
[96:27.68]I will make the determination.
[96:29.93]Also, I know this doesn't need to be said, but I'm going to say it anyways.
[96:34.35]This whole event is just for fun.
[96:37.52]This doesn't matter.
[96:40.40]If you lose the House Flipper Invitational...
[96:43.68]It doesn't.
[96:44.58]This was just all for fun.
[96:45.78]Like, none of this matters.
[96:47.65]It matters to have fun.
[96:49.47]That's it.
[96:51.95]What's the prize?
[96:55.06]No comment.
[96:58.66]No comment.
[97:03.05]The prize is friendship.
[97:07.16]Why are you so offended?
[97:08.38]I just have, like, an offended-looking face.
[97:10.26]I'm perfect for an HOA president.
[97:15.19]Can you please destroy the loser's house?
[97:17.19]No, that's so mean.
[97:18.81]I mean, that's funny, but horribly mean.
[97:21.96]I can't do that.
[97:22.88]That's not going to happen.
[97:30.47]We're at the five minute mark.
[97:31.69]I'm going to give everybody five minute warning and make sure to tell them to save.
[97:38.98]Five minute warning, by the way, whoever the host is, save the game at the end of the timer.
[97:44.41]Make sure you save what you did.
[97:46.11]Five minute warning.
[97:47.35]Good luck.
[97:48.79]Thank you.
[97:50.37]Five minute warning, whoever the host is.
[97:53.46]Sorry, I jump scared you.
[97:54.44]Five minute warning, whoever the host is, make sure the host saves the game.
[97:59.08]Escape, save, save the property.
[98:01.67]Good luck.
[98:02.11]Five minute warning.
[98:05.95]How come when I search couch, I get a freaking cup?
[98:09.99]Jerma.
[98:10.45]Type sofa.
[98:11.16]Type sofa.
[98:13.14]Do you just know everything?
[98:14.18]I'm the president of the HOA.
[98:16.64]Five minute warning.
[98:19.51]Okay.
[98:20.37]By the way, whoever the host is, save the game when the timer is up.
[98:23.57]Cool.
[98:23.81]See you later.
[98:28.02]Five minute warning, guys.
[98:29.08]Jump scare on you, but five minute warning.
[98:30.44]Whoever the host is, make sure you save the game at the end.
[98:33.43]When everything pencils down, escape, save game.
[98:38.61]We need more time.
[98:40.56]I can't add anymore.
[98:42.38]I already added about ten minutes.
[98:45.28]Good luck.
[98:48.25]Five minute warning.
[98:49.41]Jump scare on you.
[98:49.99]Sorry, but five minute warning.
[98:51.43]Is one of you guys the host?
[98:54.49]I don't know.
[98:55.18]Okay, cool.
[98:56.18]Good luck.
[98:56.46]Five minute warning.
[98:59.15]Five minute warning.
[99:00.38]Under five minutes now.
[99:01.68]Four and a half minutes.
[99:03.66]Can we have another hour?
[99:05.14]The event would be three days.
[99:09.49]Nandre, you're the host at the end of When Pencils Are Down in four minutes.
[99:13.78]I need you to save the game.
[99:15.20]You need to save the game.
[99:16.12]Escape.
[99:16.62]Save.
[99:17.66]Would you lose the sponsorship if I didn't?
[99:21.45]No, I would just probably lose your house.
[99:24.09]Oh, God.
[99:25.51]Alright.
[99:25.81]Save game.
[99:26.68]Save game.
[99:27.30]Four minutes remaining.
[99:28.02]Good luck.
[99:30.39]Okay, they're going.
[99:31.33]Four minutes remaining.
[99:32.35]Four minutes remaining.
[99:33.35]That's good.
[99:33.95]Yeah, yeah.
[99:34.70]I'm liking it.
[99:35.06]I'm liking it.
[99:35.72]Who's the host?
[99:37.76]It's Pugro.
[99:38.56]Me, Eric.
[99:39.70]When pencils are down, make sure to escape.
[99:42.11]Save game after pencils down.
[99:43.77]Make sure you save the game as the host.
[99:45.73]Okay, cool.
[99:46.57]Are you ready to fly?
[99:47.58]Maybe do that.
[99:50.20]Under five minute warning here.
[99:51.16]We've got three and a half minutes left.
[99:53.85]Okay.
[99:54.71]Is one of you the host?
[99:57.31]That's me.
[99:57.91]When this is over in three minutes, you need to save the game.
[100:00.82]So hit escape, save game.
[100:02.50]Make sure it's a hard save.
[100:04.42]Good luck.
[100:07.62]Under five minutes, by the way, three minute warning.
[100:09.58]It's coming down to the wire here.

[100:21.62]Make sure you save the game after three minutes when pencils are down.
[100:24.12]Three minutes.
[100:24.60]Save the game at the end.
[100:28.39]two minutes three minutes remaining a three minute warning copy that copy that good luck thank you thank you sark again it's just like screaming ah that's so funny contradicting times it takes two minutes to go down everyone's fine they had 75 minutes
[100:53.47]They're getting stressed.
[100:54.91]Alright.
[100:55.99]I'm excited.
[100:56.55]This is what's coming down to it.
[100:58.36]Who up here is going to stick around?
[101:01.20]Place your bets.
[101:02.18]Oh, maybe it'd be Ludwig.
[101:04.37]Oh, no.
[101:04.87]But what about Sina and Valkyrie?
[101:06.69]They probably have a cool house.
[101:07.87]I bet they do.
[101:08.46]Maybe it'll be tight.
[101:09.66]Oh, Ster and Poke.
[101:10.88]That's going to be a really tight match.
[101:12.94]I think it's going to be Joel.
[101:14.11]Oh, dude, it might be.
[101:23.55]This is why people need another hour.
[101:27.06]You can't... Okay, last year, it was 40 minutes.
[101:33.03]It was two 20-minute builds last year and then one 90-minute build.
[101:37.38]And they couldn't build at the same time.
[101:39.10]75 minutes with two people building?
[101:42.66]That's generous.
[101:44.07]That's generous.
[101:47.73]Joel is helping the other two.
[101:57.47]has Joel just kind of assimilated himself into the other team?
[102:01.34]Is he like, I feel like that's what's going on.
[102:04.05]I feel like Joel is on the other team.
[102:08.75]That's so funny.
[102:28.30]Okay.
[102:28.98]Under a minute.
[102:29.42]55 seconds.
[102:34.23]Jerma, do you join their game and walk around?
[102:36.47]Yes.
[102:38.27]I will explain everything.
[102:39.21]We're going to bring everybody up to the regular channel.
[102:42.31]We're going to bring everybody up to the channel that I'm in right now.
[102:46.22]I'm sure people are going to be screaming.
[102:50.16]We'll see.
[102:54.36]So I'm going to get ready.
[102:56.45]Let's get to the main menu.

[104:33.25]Oh, Stanz, if I could high-five you, I would piss your sweet lips.
[104:36.97]Nandre, why don't you just come over and fly in my window real quick?
[104:40.75]I looked at your house.
[104:42.24]Dude, I'm not a cuck, though.
[104:43.30]I'm not spending time over there.
[104:46.76]alright okay alright welcome back everybody thank you time is up yeah so we can't do anything else I would say whatever you are doing right now put it down and do it finish it come look at what I
[104:59.06]Okay.
[104:59.60]What?
[105:00.33]Finish it.
[105:00.69]I've got a whole lot of things I can keep doing.
[105:02.49]Finish it.
[105:03.31]What do you think of this texture?
[105:04.87]You have 10 seconds.
[105:05.81]10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[105:12.70]Alright.
[105:14.92]That's it.
[105:19.58]I like the tree.
[105:21.15]That looks really good.
[105:22.21]Here's how this is going to work.
[105:23.21]Welcome back, everybody.
[105:23.91]Thank you.
[105:24.91]Hope everybody had a good time.
[105:25.79]Hope you made something interesting.
[105:26.89]You're fighting for a spot in the neighborhood.
[105:30.56]Could be a dream home.
[105:31.40]Could be something interesting.
[105:32.66]You're fighting for a spot in the neighborhood.
[105:34.32]You can see my screen right now.
[105:35.42]That's the neighborhood right now.
[105:37.18]How this is going to work.
[105:39.31]Right now, I am going to go just down the road here.
[105:43.75]And we're going to make this snappy, by the way.
[105:46.15]The last couple of years we've done this,
[105:48.24]It has been eight and a half hours of doing tours.
[105:51.62]The judging takes so long.
[105:53.97]So here's how this is going to work.
[105:57.19]You have a strict 10 minutes to show me your house or less.
[106:03.22]You have 10 minutes to show it to me.
[106:04.70]We need 10 minutes, baby.
[106:05.86]10 minutes.
[106:07.07]That's plenty of time.
[106:08.05]10's even long.
[106:09.47]For both houses?
[106:10.79]That's going to take two hours to judge Ryan's one.
[106:12.71]No, we're good.
[106:13.17]We're good.
[106:13.45]We're good.
[106:13.96]It's up to 10 minutes.
[106:16.40]And I will determine when I've seen enough.
[106:18.61]That is not strict.
[106:19.61]That is not a strict anything.
[106:21.51]I will determine.
[106:22.80]I will determine when I've had enough after five minutes, okay?
[106:26.14]Heard, Shep.
[106:26.40]Heard.
[106:27.19]The reason why this is going to... There's going to be a bonus points for being fast and efficient.
[106:31.61]I will consider that.
[106:32.77]Alright.
[106:32.99]But here's the thing, right?
[106:34.51]The reason why this will go probably a little quicker than last time is two houses are on the same lot.
[106:40.04]I'm going to be in the game still.
[106:42.02]So I'm going to be able to do two tours right after the other.
[106:44.47]I thought it was because you're late for your shift at Best Buy.
[106:46.95]Do you have any idea?
[106:51.28]Okay.
[106:53.02]You do look like the guy that gave me my Switch 2 pre-order.
[106:55.74]I'm not going to lie.
[106:58.41]Hey.
[106:58.51]What?
[107:00.58]Alright, I demand silence.
[107:02.34]I demand silence.
[107:03.04]The HOA president is speaking.
[107:06.19]How this is going to work.
[107:07.03]Yes, Mr. President.
[107:07.81]Thank you.
[107:08.51]Who said that?
[107:09.13]You get two points.
[107:10.64]That was Stu, my teammate.
[107:12.26]Yes, Mr. President.
[107:13.06]Alright, that's an extra two points.
[107:14.30]No, no, you're too late.
[107:15.10]Don't copy me.
[107:16.49]That's two points over there.
[107:17.41]Thank you.
[107:18.19]Alright, so first up, we're just going to go right down the list.
[107:20.83]Ludwig, who's the host of your game?

[108:03.97]Yeah.
[108:05.03]Anything for you, man.
[108:06.88]Alright.
[108:07.16]So Ludwig, when somebody leaves the game, this is important.
[108:11.83]When I join, it's going to reload the map.
[108:17.04]So make sure you are saved before I come in.
[108:19.76]I hit the save button several times, and I hope it works.
[108:23.47]And I sent you the code.
[108:25.23]Yeah, I sent it to you on Discord privately in our friend chat.
[108:29.28]So I am going to join right now.
[108:32.63]You had cross-platform off, by the way, right?
[108:35.13]No, that's hella on.
[108:37.09]Is that bad?

[108:45.43]But please clear the line so I can get the tour.
[108:49.15]Copy that.
[108:51.44]If this doesn't load, I'm going to be so sad if I F someone up.
[108:54.16]No, this should be fine.
[108:58.37]This is pretty much how it works.
[109:00.29]I'm loading in right now.
[109:01.19]We should all be loading.
[109:02.05]Okay.
[109:02.62]Squeeze is going to lead our tour, by the way.
[109:05.13]Okay.
[109:05.57]Yeah, I can lead the tour.
[109:06.45]No worries.
[109:07.81]Alright.
[109:08.05]Let me get it.
[109:08.49]I'm not going to look at anything yet.
[109:09.93]Let me get it on the screen.
[109:12.14]And I can Discord screen share for people, for ours at least.
[109:17.65]Okay.
[109:22.74]Alright.
[109:23.70]Very interesting.
[109:24.28]Okay.
[109:24.54]So this is your house here.
[109:26.47]Yeah, this is our house, so first of all... Sorry, I hate to interrupt already.
[109:29.85]This is our home.
[109:30.53]Oh yeah, go ahead.
[109:31.07]This is our home.
[109:31.97]Sorry, keep going.
[109:33.43]Oh yeah.
[109:33.75]Wait a minute, Jerma.
[109:35.41]Jerma, can you share your screen?
[109:36.48]Because otherwise there's like a three second delay between your audio and your video.
[109:39.36]If you could just do that, that'd be great.
[109:40.52]What is sharing?
[109:41.10]Is it to me?
[109:42.08]Yeah, I'm sharing mine, but he'll have to do it eventually.
[109:43.48]But you're sharing your perspective, not what Jerma's seeing, right?
[109:45.87]Sure, sure, sure, sure.
[109:47.07]Different lens.
[109:47.63]How the hell do I do that in this?
[109:49.39]On Discord, it should say House Flipper 2 at the bottom, and then you just click the button.
[109:55.56]Oh, shit.
[109:56.42]OK, share screen on the bottom left.
[109:58.16]Yeah.
[109:58.57]Yeah.
[109:59.29]And it's a game game.
[110:00.97]This one here.
[110:01.39]OK, not tech is changed.
[110:03.00]Can you see?
[110:06.75]Should be able to be good.
[110:09.36]Cool.
[110:09.78]Thank you, Jerma.
[110:10.58]Alright.
[110:10.86]Good to go.
[110:11.40]Hi, everybody.
[110:12.17]Oh, hi, everybody.
[110:13.69]So I'm Squeaks and I'm going to be showing Ludwig in my home.
[110:17.49]So feel free to interrupt at any point if you have any questions.
[110:20.92]This is going to be a very productive tour.
[110:22.68]So the theme that we went for was sort of cottagecore, cozy vibes.
[110:27.25]So sort of inspired by Hobbit, but also functional.
[110:30.52]So we went for like a little bit of a patio yard.
[110:32.72]We can see our garden gnome.
[110:33.90]His name is Richard.
[110:34.84]Very interesting.
[110:35.64]And you can see we have like plants as well, which is inspired for the organic theme.
[110:41.08]And before we go in, let's take a nice 360 view of our home.
[110:45.31]First, let's go under these beautiful oak arches.
[110:49.27]Wood is a big theme here.
[110:50.83]Wood is a big theme here.
[110:52.60]And whenever you see wood, make sure you really, really take a good look at it.
[110:57.19]Now, as you see, this is actually intentional.
[111:00.85]Have you seen the 2001 Space Odyssey, Jermon?
[111:03.94]It's been all 9,000.
[111:05.44]All 9,000.
[111:06.69]So this is an architectural decision inspired by a 2001 space odyssey showing the passage of time.
[111:13.74]And the cottage theme, you know, as it is seen as a retro theme, we wanted to also add a modern twist to it, which shows the changing of an epoch.
[111:24.22]So let's keep it going.
[111:26.16]It's very similar to the thematic change in 2001.
[111:28.44]So that was not a mistake.
[111:29.49]I peed behind the wall.
[111:30.89]No, that was not a mistake.
[111:31.99]No, no, that wasn't a mistake.
[111:33.11]Just like in 2001, have you seen, like, you remember those, the unknown obelisk in the 2001 Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick?
[111:41.44]It's the same shape as that.
[111:43.29]What's going on back here?
[111:45.04]Here we have a barbecue grill, and it's also, and I don't want to guilt you into giving us good ratings, it's also someone's first birthday today.
[111:54.95]Is this made out of hot dog meat?
[111:56.37]Is that made out of hot dog meat?
[111:58.17]Yeah, it is.
[111:59.53]And here's some extra hot dog we made just for you, Supreme Chancellor.
[112:03.36]If you want to eat, if you want to have a bite.
[112:05.20]Interesting.
[112:05.78]Okay, very nice, very nice.
[112:07.28]Alright, what else we got?
[112:09.26]So we got a little bit of a fireplace here.
[112:11.30]We have it freshly turned on.
[112:13.01]And let's go ahead and go into the house.
[112:16.63]yeah real cozy here okay I'm liking it I do I do enjoy the the there's a nice curb appeal here
[112:23.10]Can you not imagine you and your best buds hanging out in the yard?
[112:26.24]I absolutely could.
[112:26.92]This looks weird.
[112:28.88]I mean, here's the thing, Jerma.
[112:30.23]I didn't want to have to be so negative on the tour.
[112:32.21]We do have some kind of contentious neighbors.
[112:35.35]You have to keep an eye out here.
[112:36.72]That's the one bad part of the house.
[112:38.70]We've got some real problem neighbors.
[112:40.34]They've been known for pizza.
[112:41.10]But we have such a beautiful house that it doesn't even matter.
[112:44.37]Now, really, actually, like, take note of this beautiful cottagecore sensation you have going on.
[112:49.81]I like the open concept.
[112:50.72]There is a multi...
[112:51.50]layer open concept on the left here a very minimalistic beautiful candlelit dinner okay a retro themed stove beautiful modernized kitchen but functional which is very important
[113:07.56]A very modern, very new stove, washer, dryer.
[113:13.23]I mean, we're retro, but we're not fucking animals.
[113:16.30]We're not in New York City.
[113:17.84]I like the sink here.
[113:19.26]The sink here is beautiful.
[113:21.53]Yeah, that's half the kitchen.
[113:24.35]Cold and dry.
[113:25.65]And then here we are a little bit of a live laugh love Cozy with a fireplace burning so you can warm your warm your cold feet and very nice very nice and a retro TV Which is great to watch cartoons or play Super Smash Bros.
[113:40.39]Melee for you Super Smash Bros.
[113:42.69]Yeah One means here together.
[113:46.30]Yeah, dude.
[113:47.14]Alright.
[113:47.52]Oh very cool.
[113:48.52]Alright.
[113:48.80]What else?
[113:49.80]We can actually, before we head into the bedroom there, if you want to come check out our loft.
[113:56.42]Oh, is this a loft?
[113:57.74]Yeah, there's a loft right up here.
[114:00.97]really oh points extra points yeah this is this is our fun pad and we play right only pool you can only play the right side out flipper two which is the sponsor of today's event yeah we love to play up here we play pool and House Flipper two is the biggest favorite game to play
[114:22.82]uh so I'm noticing one or two little things here it seems like you built the roof a little too high which is the reason why you had to make a loft with a last second decision uh because whoa whoa whoa whoa actually that was the first thing we did I'm not even like trying to cover whether the first thing we did was this was the loft okay alright yeah yeah alright alright so what anything else this I this is very beautiful
[114:47.70]And then this is the bedroom, which my colleague Ludwig was sort of the project manager.
[114:52.50]Yeah, I can take over the bedroom.
[114:56.45]You know, we get a little bit crazy in this.
[114:58.73]Yeah, you can see there's a lot of colors.
[115:00.03]We're maximalists.
[115:05.92]A lot.
[115:13.36]This bedroom.
[117:33.90]Alright, can anybody hear me?
[117:39.23]Can you guys hear me?
[117:42.06]Alright, I think- Was your house really boring?
[117:45.87]I think the screen recording on
[118:29.98]It's Flipper 2.
[118:30.68]It's really something special.
[118:32.78]I should be back.
[118:33.56]Alright.
[118:34.34]I think for some reason, screen sharing on Discord also killed my whole computer.
[118:39.67]We'll just watch the stream.
[118:40.79]I think it's a good idea to have whoever is presenting, if it's okay.
[118:45.25]We'll watch.
[118:46.81]What was what?
[118:47.61]Chill.
[118:48.19]Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill.
[118:49.92]We're waiting on Jerma.
[118:50.66]We're waiting on Jerma.
[118:51.30]I'm back.
[118:51.74]I'm here.
[118:52.42]Everybody refresh the stream.
[118:54.28]Refresh.
[118:55.32]sorry about that I care apparently my computer just started cooking itself and we're good alright so where were we where were we don't worry uh go ahead ludwig you can go through the last room we had a fun time in the bathroom but now we need to clean up so let's go to the uh bathroom here we are in the bathroom okay come in my bathroom please thank you okay here we are
[119:14.90]Alright, so, whoa, very functional, very 70s.
[119:19.61]Very nice, very beautiful.
[119:21.33]I like the purple.
[119:23.54]Notice the symmetry of the sink with the kitchen.
[119:26.42]I'm just seeing a little bit of a something here with the ceiling.
[119:31.47]Jeremiah, can I be so real about that?
[119:33.98]Go ahead.
[119:34.28]I just honestly got fucked up and I thought about changing it when your computer crashed, but I didn't.
[119:38.51]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[119:41.37]What are you saying?
[119:42.13]I fucked up.
[119:43.03]I did the wallpaper from the bedroom and it bled in.
[119:45.58]I didn't know it would do that and I didn't check.
[119:48.32]Wait, have you heard the allegory of a samurai?
[119:51.14]Have you heard the allegory of a samurai?
[119:52.98]Don't bullshit him.
[119:53.93]You used to be a teacher.
[119:55.05]Don't free pass it.
[119:56.17]I used to be a teacher too.
[119:58.84]Alright, I love the bathroom.
[120:00.44]It's kind of huge, but that's fine.
[120:04.11]Alright, what else?
[120:04.86]Yeah, I did make it massive.
[120:06.52]What do you mean, what else?
[120:07.42]It's over.
[120:07.84]Oh, my God.
[120:12.24]You can't hit mom like that.
[120:13.62]What is that?
[120:14.68]I can't say what else.
[120:15.97]I can't.
[120:16.35]Yeah, that was kind of.
[120:17.19]Alright.
[120:18.33]Alright.
[120:18.99]It's beautiful.
[120:19.59]Actually, it's wonderful.
[120:20.90]I love it.
[120:21.34]I love the photos up here.
[120:22.50]I love the fireplace.
[120:25.02]It's a very beautiful home.
[120:26.55]You guys did actually wonderful.
[120:28.21]And I do appreciate the wood.
[120:30.72]it's very beautiful I mean it's actually nice a little underwhelming compared to the neighbors I'm glad they went first though okay setting the bar alright that was sweet thank you so much wonderful you're welcome and we're very excited for round two because we've learned so much and we'd be great okay so ray could you share your screens I could follow you so now here's the thing uh whoever is not the host on ludwig's team you need to drop
[120:57.28]Well, they can stay.
[120:58.34]I can just talk because I can see Ray's screen.
[121:00.29]Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[121:01.31]It makes it easier.
[121:01.99]Is that good for you guys?
[121:03.81]Does that work?
[121:05.96]Yeah, I can follow Ray actually perfectly if you want to do that.
[121:08.29]That way you don't have to take the time.
[121:11.37]This is beautiful right off the bat.
[121:14.34]Curbside appeal is fantastic.
[121:16.36]We cared about the curb appeal.
[121:19.87]We were inspired by the lack of curb appeal from our neighbor.
[121:24.42]So we wanted to really do a wonderful job
[121:27.35]showcasing the nature and beauty that a yard can bring to a home.
[121:32.58]And you see there's different landscapes, okay?
[121:34.83]Like not everything is flat.
[121:36.29]There's some things that are a little raised.
[121:38.56]So if you want a little hilly area, you can go over there.
[121:40.53]There's fountains too.
[121:42.35]I do like the, it's kind of reminiscent of Sonic the Hedgehog's first level.
[121:48.66]Yes.
[121:49.22]This is very, very, very nice.
[121:50.80]Nostalgic, right?
[121:51.50]It is, yeah.
[121:51.94]That was kind of like our inspiration.
[121:53.42]Yeah, that's what it was.
[121:55.13]I like how set back the house is, and it is, I'm going to let you go ahead and take the floor here.
[122:00.11]This is beautiful.
[122:02.56]It's like a nice fairy walk through a garden, okay?
[122:06.22]Dude, their outdoor is so nice.
[122:08.24]Trials and tribulations.
[122:10.04]Oh, sorry, I'm sorry.
[122:12.29]Ray, do you want to show some of the amenities of the garden?
[122:15.35]Yes.
[122:16.74]You know, we pass the fountain up here so the birds will come.
[122:19.50]If you look to the left, we have a ton of sunflowers.
[122:22.15]There's actually butterflies.
[122:23.47]Notice how they don't cross the fence.
[122:25.34]That's because the neighbor doesn't have any flowers.
[122:27.74]yeah and I don't know if you saw like the neighbors they keep a lot of trash randomly in their yard and it's you know it's a little weird so all the nice beautiful animals and bugs they just kind of stay on our side they stay over here because it's warm and welcoming like a home should be yeah I I'm understanding that I'm understanding that very very nice
[122:45.36]Yes.
[122:46.14]If you ever need to have a wedding, you can have... I also just want to add in, like, you know, I always hear a lot of arguing coming from the neighbors next door.
[122:53.37]It seems like they just can't really get it together.
[122:55.52]It's not a happy home.
[122:56.76]But this is a very happy home.
[122:59.77]I love the grand piano.
[123:01.47]Okay.
[123:02.15]Very, very nice grand piano right at the entrance.
[123:04.95]yes okay and then there's a nice couch too you know cozy couch yeah I don't know one thing actually cottage core yes great sorry just like cyber really fast right what the fuck is on the wall where yeah it seems like there's some there's a
[123:23.43]This is some kind of a medical document.
[123:25.49]Oh, because we want an educated home.
[123:27.20]Alright.
[123:28.00]Our dream home is a place where there's learning.
[123:30.18]Look, there's National Geographic's all over.
[123:32.56]Wow.
[123:33.04]We have a monthly subscription.
[123:36.87]And a home is where we continue to learn and grow together as a family.
[123:41.17]We love learning and reading.
[123:42.52]Excellent point.
[123:43.92]And you know what else we also love?
[123:45.66]We also love food.
[123:46.87]The foot and leg right here.
[123:48.21]Very important.
[123:49.45]Very interesting.
[123:50.78]We also love food, by the way.
[123:52.52]If you walk over here, you'll notice a fully functional kitchen.
[123:55.59]Yeah.
[123:56.11]Our neighbors didn't have any food in their fridge, but...
[123:59.54]I do see flies.
[124:01.71]There are flies here.
[124:04.07]Where?
[124:05.10]There are a lot of flies.
[124:10.09]Well, the door was left open.
[124:11.33]Sometimes, you know, it's the neighbor's yard.
[124:13.23]Remember all the trash?
[124:14.64]Oh, yeah.
[124:15.08]True, true, true.
[124:16.92]It could also be the hamburger left out for three or four days.
[124:19.91]That was like left out like maybe like 30 minutes ago though.
[124:22.52]Anyways.
[124:24.58]Excellent.
[124:25.14]Alright.
[124:25.86]Yes.
[124:26.22]We're in a drought.
[124:28.12]Okay.
[124:28.42]What about what's going on in the corner here?
[124:30.13]I see there's a big mirror.
[124:31.21]This is very, very beautiful.
[124:32.79]Watermelons everywhere too.
[124:34.19]Yes.
[124:34.75]That's a full harvest of watermelon.
[124:36.84]We definitely have a watermelon garden outside.
[124:39.42]We just brought them in and we wanted to share them with our neighbors because that's what home is.
[124:45.95]sharing and also we got some tomatoes in the fridge as well if you wanted to see those are also for our neighbors but more sort of throw at them oh they fresh excellent yeah we have thrown a few of them very very upstairs if you'll notice the column and the stair artwork you know the stairs arch around the column uh in in a good way that leads you to the beautiful bedroom bathroom combo
[125:12.16]I do say that is a bathroom-bedroom combination.
[125:17.12]Two of the world's greatest comforts together.
[125:19.91]Right.
[125:20.85]Okay.
[125:21.31]I don't hate it because there at least is enough here.
[125:23.85]One thing I do have to say is if I am sitting here using the toilet, there is a window right there.
[125:34.14]And if somebody is across the way on the street, they could look right in to next Tuesday, as they say.
[125:42.03]Our dream home is welcoming.
[125:44.29]It's supposed to be open, you know?
[125:46.13]Yeah, open, comfortable, and happy, you know?
[125:51.17]Yeah.
[125:52.52]Alright.
[125:52.92]Oh, there's people peeking.
[125:54.48]OK.
[125:54.92]Let me tell both of you guys, I am very surprised.
[125:59.30]I did not, you guys, when I jumped in a couple of times, it sounds like, look at this, it's a beautiful home with a beautiful landscape.
[126:06.85]OK, so we learned a lot under pressure.
[126:09.59]You should go in the backyard and hold your feet.
[126:11.19]Let's take a look at the backyard.
[126:12.35]Oh, yes.
[126:13.33]There's not much, but there is a lawnmower as well because we do take pride in our outdoor area.
[126:19.68]Okay, so I have a decision to make now, which is who is going to continue to be in the neighborhood.
[126:26.09]And I have to say... Oh, what the hell?
[126:30.27]Sorry, I just saw a bunch of trash outside.
[126:32.51]I do have to say... I think I know who's going to move on.
[126:41.09]Oh, I mean, it's pretty obvious.
[126:43.03]I have to tell you, they're both beautiful.
[126:45.34]They're both wonderful.
[126:47.05]But let me take one more quick.
[126:49.25]Is it the yard flipper tournament or the House Flipper tournament?
[126:51.44]Like, what are we doing here?
[126:52.82]Wait, can you look under the ground in both of the houses?
[126:58.15]You got it!
[127:01.11]Can you look under the ground?
[127:02.54]I'm just saying.
[127:04.24]I didn't know how to delete stuff.
[127:07.21]Don't go underground.
[127:08.09]I didn't know how to delete stuff.
[127:09.55]I put it underground.
[127:12.32]That's hiding shit.
[127:15.34]Okay.
[127:15.81]I'm just saying.
[127:16.83]This is their staircase, to be clear.
[127:18.31]This is their staircase.
[127:19.25]They didn't know how to get rid of a giant staircase.
[127:20.67]Yeah, but that's added amenities for us.
[127:22.19]It's added amenities.
[127:23.23]Guys, I gotta say, Ludwig Squeaks, I'm telling you, I think... I think... Oh, but you have a beautiful bathroom.
[127:35.47]This bathroom is perfect.
[127:37.87]And I will say the points... Well, the wallpaper's questionable.
[127:40.48]Okay.
[127:41.87]Yeah, and let's talk about that loft.
[127:43.33]Did they really make that first?
[127:45.10]We all know.
[127:47.02]I'm embarrassed.
[127:48.30]I just did.
[127:49.24]The allegory of the samurai would have saved us, Ludwig.
[127:52.47]You cannot ever admit defeat.
[127:53.99]I will say this weird kind of half ceiling, but it's a loft.
[128:00.78]I genuinely built it first, Jerma.
[128:02.68]I don't know what to tell you.
[128:03.90]I'm embarrassed.
[128:05.94]I think it's great.
[128:06.62]It's great, but this yard is very elaborate.
[128:09.92]That's a custom-built staircase.
[128:15.29]This bathroom is bad.
[128:16.89]Let's just be honest.
[128:17.67]This is not a good bathroom.
[128:19.81]I mean, define bad, though.
[128:26.81]Girls don't go to the bathroom.
[128:30.31]I just have one question, Jerma, and hopefully this helps form your opinion.
[128:33.86]Where are they showering?
[128:36.83]That's true.
[128:37.51]Well, we are a free open, we're a free open family.
[128:40.64]So we were going to use the garden hose outside.
[128:42.93]I know you're free and open because you got a single bed for two people in front of the shitter.
[128:47.42]This is really fucking hard.
[128:48.08]First of all, I'm sorry that we are in a happy, loving home and we can cuddle together.
[128:51.36]Here's the thing.
[128:52.63]If we put our house in your yard, it would be so awesome.
[128:58.06]That's true.
[128:59.78]That's true.
[129:01.59]If we work together, it'd be awesome.
[129:05.53]I mean, yeah, it's a little... Some of these trees maybe don't grow in this climate, but... I knocked down a tree by accident.
[129:14.89]I want to apologize.
[129:15.99]All of the trees are invasive.
[129:19.29]Oh, this is hard.
[129:21.44]This is actually... I didn't know it was going to be this hard, but it is.
[129:24.80]What if we become a team of four?
[129:26.14]It's...
[129:28.47]I gotta make the call.
[129:29.07]We move on together.
[129:29.69]I gotta make the call.
[129:30.71]I gotta make the call.
[129:32.58]Yeah.
[129:38.85]What, a neighborly $5?
[129:40.21]Ray and Senna, congratulations.
[129:47.42]No way!
[129:49.06]No way, really?
[129:50.15]Yeah.
[129:51.24]No, are you joking?
[129:52.36]That's crazy.
[129:53.22]No, I'm not.
[129:54.64]I honestly think that's well-earned.
[129:56.32]Great job.
[129:57.16]Okay, we will do better on the bathroom.
[129:58.87]We'll do better.
[129:59.43]I will tell you the reasoning.
[130:01.83]The reason is the outdoor led into the indoor.
[130:06.78]You used a lot of the space.
[130:09.08]Not only that, you didn't even talk about the gazebo over here.
[130:11.99]No, I did.
[130:12.35]I said you could have weddings here if you want.
[130:13.57]Oh, that's right, you did.
[130:15.25]I will tell you, this indoor, the indoor on their side was a little bit better, but...
[130:21.61]the fact that you figured out how to build the staircase and connect it correctly they had a ladder up to the ceiling yeah that was all you right that was all you and I that was the deciding factor the deciding factor here staircase that was intentional I even put a staircase in it oh it's a great call this is this is a great connection here it's a it's a I think you didn't give yourself enough credit I love the kitchen the flies were a little bit off
[130:46.48]Oh, true, true.
[130:47.35]OK, we should leave food out.
[130:48.43]We should leave food.
[130:49.47]We'll clean the food.
[130:50.43]We learned a lot.
[130:51.02]We learned a lot this round.
[130:52.60]This was a good house.
[130:54.02]But the upstairs was it was kind of just a pool table.
[130:57.89]And I mean, the pool table being in the slanted part, it was I loved it.

[132:32.20]Yeah.
[132:32.74]Jeremy, you want me to DM you or post it in the dining room?
[132:35.21]You just post it in the living room in general.
[132:37.17]It's fine.
[132:38.33]Should I just click disconnect and I'm good?
[132:40.24]Yeah, you'll be good if you just disconnect.
[132:43.26]Alright, who's doing the first tour?
[132:44.52]Is it going to be Etalyx and Vinny, I'm assuming?
[132:47.09]Yeah.
[132:47.67]Okay, I'm coming in.
[132:48.93]Alright, I'm going to mute and watch.
[132:50.11]So if you need me, I'll hear you late.
[132:52.82]Me too.
[132:54.79]Okay.
[132:56.37]Here we go.
[132:56.67]Jeremy, does that make Cutie and I last?
[132:59.19]Because if so, I might go for a run.
[133:01.16]No, no.
[133:01.44]You guys will be next.
[133:02.16]You guys come up next.
[133:03.64]Okay.
[133:03.80]Okay.
[133:03.94]Alright.
[133:05.54]I'm in.
[133:08.43]It's loading for us.
[133:11.75]I am so surprised.
[133:12.71]Ray and Sin, a good job.
[133:15.00]Every time I jumped in, every time I came in, I thought you guys were asking how to put floors down.
[133:19.95]I thought you guys were going to have a cube.
[133:22.31]I did too.
[133:25.07]We originally had a Minecraft house.
[133:26.53]We were going to go with a prison, but we fixed it up.
[133:30.02]Very good.
[133:30.54]Alright.
[133:30.98]I'm coming in.
[133:31.68]Nice job, Ray.
[133:35.02]Nice job.
[133:35.71]I am in and I don't even know what the fuck's going on over there.
[133:42.15]So we'll start with ours.
[133:46.58]Can somebody share their screen?
[133:49.60]Because for me to do it, it will crash my whole computer like it just happened.
[133:54.16]I can share, but now you've got me nervous that it's going to crash the entire computer.
[133:58.58]But let's give it a try.
[134:01.51]Are you guys going to be doing a dual tour, I'm imagining?
[134:04.11]Yeah, I would imagine so.
[134:08.33]Okay.
[134:09.74]Are we ready?
[134:12.20]Is the stream working for the rest?
[134:15.44]Yes.
[134:16.34]Thank you.
[134:18.11]Okay, so, Jerma, welcome to our bathroom museum.
[134:27.07]Okay.
[134:28.90]Alright.
[134:29.60]Every good neighborhood needs to focus on public facilities like parks and public restrooms and just having houses that constantly put up signs and try to like stop people from doing things.
[134:43.85]Right.
[134:44.11]I don't think it's really the right way to go about handling it.
[134:47.72]Okay.
[134:47.98]You got to be open to the public.
[134:50.08]Yeah, this isn't open at all to the public.
[134:52.84]This is just like I get bad vibes from that place.
[134:56.96]But our place, however, if you would be so kind as to pick a door, any door.
[135:02.58]Okay.
[135:03.72]I'm going to pick, I'll pick the left door.
[135:06.37]That's great.
[135:09.42]Okay.
[135:09.79]so welcome to the reception area of the bathroom museum and we're going to take you on a journey through time a journey through history yes the history of bathrooms you're going to see some really cool stuff you're going to learn and you can use our facilities too if you want it's open to the public I could use the bathroom I kind of got to go that's not that yeah Monday through Friday we do close at 5 30 p.m so just barring those restrictions
[135:39.06]So here's where I would take your ticket.
[135:41.25]It's free anyway, so here you may step through.
[135:44.93]Alright, so this is the first part of the bathroom museum.
[135:48.20]Yeah.
[135:49.98]This is a historical tour.
[135:53.61]Okay.
[135:54.03]So we're going to start here.
[135:55.27]And we're starting all the way at the beginning.
[135:57.42]All the way at the beginning here.
[135:59.98]Yes.
[136:00.08]The beginning of bathrooms.
[136:05.59]A hole in the ground.
[136:07.75]Very accurate.
[136:08.79]Yes.
[136:09.92]Is there a shit in there?
[136:10.76]Oh my god, did you put a shit in there?
[136:13.60]Well, I mean, it's a museum.
[136:17.25]It is.
[136:17.99]Now, have you been to IKEA?
[136:20.05]Are you aware of those public toilets?
[136:21.61]I'm very aware of IKEA, yes.
[136:23.98]They actually have to, like, nail them shut.
[136:27.33]you know, because people get a little wacky in them.
[136:30.71]But this is just a prop, so don't worry about that.
[136:33.84]This isn't like IKEA where people go and pry the nails off the toilets.
[136:37.46]It's disgusting over there.
[136:38.60]We are, however, looking for staff who might be willing to clean.
[136:43.17]I see, I see.
[136:45.13]Once in a while.
[136:47.22]I like what you did with the hall here.
[136:49.97]Thank you.
[136:51.17]So yeah, we start with the hole in the ground.
[136:53.50]It's very basic.
[136:54.40]Anyone could do that.
[136:55.20]And then of course you go to the classic outhouse.
[137:00.69]Okay, very nice.
[137:02.33]Can I ask a question before I step in the door?
[137:05.19]And you can say yes or no.
[137:06.29]I just want a yes or no from both of you at the same time.
[137:09.72]Yeah.
[137:09.84]Is there a coiled shit behind this door?
[137:13.90]Just give me a moment, please.
[137:19.66]What answer would you like?
[137:21.46]I would like a yes or a no.
[137:24.85]I'm going to say it depends on your definition of coiled shit.
[137:29.19]How do you feel about croissants?
[137:36.41]there a in every one of these bathrooms is there I'm just asking is there a in each one of these sections it's it's not real did somebody get in here while we were building this I don't know I don't know where that I don't think that's real these are you two in these before you did the tour which means if there's a in this one somebody has had a lot of roughage somebody had a lot of Jermas Jerma our special effects are very realistic anyway moving on to the next door of the tour you may step inside
[138:04.83]As a museum, we strive for realism and authenticity.
[138:10.10]Okay.
[138:10.22]And this is with the medieval time, medieval Europe or something with the buckets?
[138:14.74]Exactly.
[138:16.27]Okay.
[138:16.39]Exactly.
[138:17.07]It is self-evident.
[138:17.95]This is, in fact, the chamber pot era of the toilet museum.
[138:22.44]Two of them.
[138:22.86]Where you can open the window and, you know, just throw it outside.
[138:28.24]Yeah.
[138:28.42]Then you never have to think about it again.
[138:29.89]Quick question.
[138:31.48]If you threw it outside, you'd be throwing it into your own house.
[138:36.26]Was that a design choice?
[138:36.98]Well, provided that it was real shit, yes, that is what we'd be doing.
[138:41.27]Okay.
[138:41.61]Yeah, but this is for illustration purposes.
[138:44.91]This is movie-grade, like, film-grade shit that's ready for camera right now.
[138:49.34]So you didn't shit in these ones.
[138:50.34]Alright, got it.
[138:50.98]Okay.
[138:51.96]No, it's like the fake tobacco.
[138:55.66]So there's a hole down the hallway?
[138:58.17]Oh, yeah.
[138:58.71]Oh, my God.
[138:59.61]Okay.
[139:00.07]Alright.
[139:00.51]I'm ready.
[139:01.39]So step on through.
[139:03.02]Alright.
[139:04.74]Oh, my God.
[139:05.58]You guys have an entire museum.
[139:06.94]You really weren't kidding.
[139:08.60]Yeah.
[139:09.33]So this next one I'll have, you know, is a really special one for this museum.
[139:15.37]And some of the pieces were donated historically by kind donors in the community.
[139:20.30]So this is the public restroom exhibit where you can see
[139:27.04]You've got broken urinal, which is the beginning, to urinal, to fancy urinal.
[139:33.45]So this is where you can be anyone you want.
[139:36.82]You can choose who you want to be.
[139:40.12]Is there a problem?
[139:41.04]Are they usable?
[139:43.73]Well, people have tried.
[139:45.61]Could you guys take a step out for a minute?
[139:53.18]Thank you.
[140:04.47]Is that a bong?
[140:15.08]Okay.
[140:15.22]Could you come back this way for just a moment?
[140:20.49]I'm here.
[140:22.02]You asked, like, who maybe or maybe not has been shitting in these demonstrative toilets that are clearly not meant to be shat in, as this is a museum, but we will have to check the camera feeds, and we will get back to you.
[140:37.27]Okay.
[140:38.71]Yeah.
[140:39.26]Wait, what?
[140:39.92]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, big, big, you got cameras in here?
[140:45.33]Yeah, I mean, like, we can't have people just coming in and, like, laying shits.
[140:48.39]This is not a real toilet.
[140:49.73]This is not a real bathroom.
[140:51.07]No, no, no, no, no.
[140:51.88]The bathroom is later.
[140:53.54]The bathroom is later.
[140:54.84]This is just all exhibit.
[140:56.66]Like, this is, like, Play-Doh bathrooms.
[140:58.50]This isn't real.
[140:59.30]This is Mickey Mouse bullshit.
[141:00.77]Right, okay, because it's a museum.
[141:02.31]Right, right, right.
[141:02.99]Yeah, our gift shop is out of, sadly, right now.
[141:05.89]We're renovating.
[141:06.57]But I'll tell you what we do have.
[141:07.65]Toilet paper is available from the gift shop if you'd like one.
[141:10.62]Very nice.
[141:11.34]Premium toilet paper.
[141:11.84]Next up.
[141:13.12]Next up, of course, we have the modern bathroom.
[141:15.72]This is what you might see in a home in the year 2025.
[141:19.89]You might see this.
[141:20.73]You might see a painting from Van Gogh or a Van Gogh-like painting.
[141:24.12]Sure.
[141:24.50]Or maybe if you're like a 10,000 plus CCV Twitch streamer, you might have a bathroom like this.
[141:30.21]Yeah.
[141:31.09]Okay.
[141:31.95]I do like the wooden toilet, the wooden seat.
[141:34.33]That's a nice touch.
[141:35.95]Thank you.
[141:36.76]Yeah, we're proud of this.
[141:38.30]Very kind community members.
[141:39.56]I like the marble.
[141:41.39]Cool.
[141:41.85]Cool.
[141:42.23]And then we have the future.
[141:43.65]This is the bathroom of the future.
[141:44.93]If you'd like to prepare yourself, this is what we will be seeing in bathrooms in the next hundred years.
[141:49.42]So you may step inside.
[141:50.70]Whoa.
[141:53.00]Yeah.
[141:54.31]Minimal.
[141:56.21]So the bathroom of a hundred years from now is just a regular toilet with LEDs on it.
[142:00.88]That's interesting.
[142:02.02]Yes.
[142:03.32]Well, this isn't just a regular toilet.
[142:06.14]It assists you in the process.
[142:08.23]So when you sit down, it extracts it from you?
[142:10.68]There's a very powerful vacuum in there.
[142:14.16]It's comfortable.
[142:15.12]And actually, some people report it feels really nice.
[142:18.19]But the LEDs are very important.
[142:20.01]And if you plug your iPod in, you can actually get the LEDs to kind of go to the music.
[142:26.25]Oh, you can do... It's really fun in there.
[142:28.02]So you could put a playlist on your toilet.
[142:31.58]Mm-hmm.
[142:32.40]What's going on here?
[142:34.46]Oh, this is the public bathroom.
[142:38.53]This is the one that actually is usable by people who come to visit our museum.
[142:42.67]It's out of order at the moment.
[142:45.29]Like most public bathrooms, we got somebody on this to go ahead and start cleaning it up and get it actually usable.
[142:53.78]Yeah.
[142:54.79]That's funny.
[142:56.35]Oh, that's fucking beautiful.
[142:57.99]Okay, so that's the usable toilet.
[143:01.25]Well, it will be.
[143:02.36]It will be eventually.
[143:03.42]Okay, yeah.
[143:04.02]Yeah, hopefully.
[143:05.31]Alright.
[143:06.25]Very, very nice.
[143:07.33]Anything else in the house that you want me to see or anything?
[143:10.05]Let me get, what about on the outside or is this everything on the inside done?
[143:13.74]Well, there's the gift shop we're going to be opening soon.
[143:16.07]It's going to sell lots of toilet paper.
[143:17.67]So if you'd like any, let me know.
[143:19.15]Excellent.
[143:19.53]Okay.
[143:20.27]I have one question.
[143:21.66]What is the admission fee?
[143:26.92]Well, it's free.
[143:27.94]It's free.
[143:28.68]And why are there two doors?
[143:30.15]We usually require a donation of lifelike sample for their toilet.
[143:35.57]There's two doors.
[143:36.78]One is for people to come in and one is for people to go out.
[143:41.48]Alright.
[143:44.13]I will say that the neighbor over here is probably going to be a little bit upset and concerned about the toilet museum that's opening next door.
[143:53.55]We've already spoken to them, and their toilet is broken.
[143:56.20]We just assured them that eventually ours will be fixed, and then they're able to come and use ours whenever they want.
[144:01.40]Yeah, for free.
[144:02.14]Yeah, yeah, anytime.
[144:03.07]And if they could donate whatever materials.
[144:06.15]Alright, excellent.
[144:06.91]Let's get a quick look at the yard, and we'll move on.
[144:11.08]Well, I mean... Well, our yard was pristine until our neighbors decided to, as you can see here, they have warped...
[144:18.34]and have distorted that was a significant amount of public signage.
[144:25.25]This is a lot of stop signs.
[144:26.93]Okay.
[144:27.81]Very, very good.
[144:28.57]Excellent.
[144:29.92]I loved it.
[144:31.02]It's time to move on to the next tour.
[144:32.48]Thank you.
[144:32.96]Etalyx and Vinny.
[144:33.86]Wonderful job.
[144:34.54]Thank you.
[144:35.10]So I think Etalyx, you have to drop out.
[144:37.18]Yes.

[146:19.65]Thank you.
[146:20.05]I appreciate it.
[146:23.15]I just want to say that we would not have encroached on their land with those stop signs if they didn't sneak into our house and shit in it every day.
[146:29.68]They've been stealing from us.
[146:31.06]What do you want us to do?
[146:32.15]Our actual bathroom's broken.
[146:34.37]Yeah.
[146:35.03]Sorry.
[146:35.69]One thing I will say, they don't have a bedroom over there.
[146:37.61]There's nowhere to sleep.
[146:40.48]We've caught them a few times, but anyways, welcome to our house.
[146:44.06]I'm Poke.
[146:44.66]This is Stirr.
[146:46.47]Welcome.
[146:47.05]Hey, how's it going?
[146:48.21]How are we?
[146:50.11]We've got a fantastic... I heard that we were supposed to make a beautiful sidewalk home.
[146:55.48]So we built a home.
[146:56.96]I said, you're fighting for a spot in the neighborhood?
[147:00.05]Your dream home?
[147:01.51]Your dream lot?
[147:03.51]You can interpret that however you want?
[147:04.95]Get that out of here!
[147:07.01]That's sabotage.
[147:08.44]That's our Amazon order.
[147:10.56]Okay.
[147:11.32]Yeah, we need to do the toilet.
[147:13.22]Alright, we're ready.
[147:14.06]Let's go.
[147:14.99]yeah take a take a nice stroll up the uh we have a winding path that help you really enjoy give a nice view from the sidewalk we wanted to make sure we really impress our neighbors let them know it's a dream home um nice stairs all the way up to the big double doors uh it's so smooth you can even ride your bike up it whoa I feel like that's kind of dangerous but oh okay
[147:36.18]Mountain biking is a is growing.
[147:38.07]It's growing.
[147:38.51]It's it's a big thing sure, but I do this trail every day Okay, I'm ready to do the inside I
[148:04.03]Well, uh, Poke, show them around.
[148:05.39]I started with the door.
[148:06.97]We have a lot of shoes.
[148:09.29]Um, we're looking to get another rack.
[148:15.20]Alright, you have to explain the pizza.
[148:16.80]What's going on with the pizza sign?
[148:20.15]Sir?
[148:20.79]Go ahead.
[148:22.89]Um... I thought it was more of Poke's decision, actually.
[148:26.61]I'll get the next one.
[148:27.79]I'll get the next one.
[148:29.06]Okay, alright.
[148:30.00]Well, then over here we have our TV.
[148:32.19]On this side, we can never find the remote.
[148:36.48]Just want to let you guys know we have a mouse problem.
[148:41.38]Where are you?
[148:42.06]I don't even know where you are.
[148:47.21]What the fuck?
[148:48.53]You might see some mouse.
[148:50.95]I have to be honest, man.
[148:53.28]What's going on?
[148:55.63]Well, as you might have noticed, all of the shoes are right feet, so... Okay.
[149:02.24]The pizza thing... So we gotta make sure we're wheelchair accessible.
[149:04.94]It will all make sense once we get to the end.
[149:06.57]It's hard to get up here sometimes, but the bike proves you can get up here.
[149:10.35]Are you sure?
[149:11.43]Okay.
[149:14.16]You're overthinking it.
[149:15.22]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[149:17.88]Continue.
[149:18.20]Let's start with the patio.
[149:19.18]Let's do the patio.
[149:21.04]It's really nice out here.
[149:22.51]Unfortunately, this awful view of the toilet museum next door.
[149:26.42]They don't even have a roof.
[149:28.28]What is this?
[149:30.66]We think they're running across it and jumping up here to shit in our bathroom.
[149:35.42]Oh, they don't have a... That is just like a... That is like a... That's not a good thing to see from your balcony.
[149:42.35]They should definitely... That's just a terrible roof.
[149:44.79]Anyways, this is our swimming area.
[149:47.60]Got a beautiful slide.
[149:50.60]You got a pool up here?
[149:52.20]Yeah, and we could slide right down into the moat.
[149:54.68]Oh, it's good.
[149:55.24]Oh, it's good.
[149:57.35]Where else are you going to see that?
[149:58.31]I do have a small HOA note on this.
[150:01.27]I'm sorry.
[150:03.37]This is like four inches deep.
[150:07.32]um that's an ankle breaker I think no no no no what do you think come over here one thing that I really love about this patio is we tried to multi-purpose and use our room efficiently so we have a table but also also it's a trampoline it works okay man this is making me so tired and hungry let's go to the kitchen
[150:33.24]Do you have any children?
[150:34.14]Because this is incredibly dangerous.
[150:36.22]Someone's going to get killed on this.
[150:39.56]Well, we do have one, but he doesn't use it much because he's missing one leg.
[150:43.79]Okay.
[150:44.07]We have the minimalistic kitchen style.
[150:47.83]Okay.
[150:48.15]Very, very interesting.
[150:49.35]Very interesting.
[150:49.91]Very minimalistic.
[150:50.73]I do like that there's a door here.
[150:52.20]I like the screen here.
[150:53.96]Very, very good.
[150:54.92]It's like, Mom, what you making, Mom?
[150:57.82]You know what I'm saying?
[150:58.44]Oh, just one minute.
[150:59.76]Oh, hey, who wants mac and cheese?
[151:01.23]And everyone could be like, yeah.
[151:02.71]Okay.
[151:03.11]Yeah.
[151:03.41]Yeah, but we're like not allowed in to interrupt you or get in the way.
[151:06.41]What is, uh, what is this?
[151:09.39]Dishwasher.
[151:11.02]No, is there a razor up here?
[151:15.44]What was that?
[151:16.68]You know, sometimes you need it.
[151:23.21]Like, what?
[151:27.23]Okay.
[151:27.35]Alright.
[151:27.53]Before we get to... Let's show you the bedroom.
[151:31.14]Okay, let's go to the bedroom.
[151:33.11]Small problem.
[151:34.67]You need to crouch.
[151:35.49]You need to crouch in.
[151:37.61]I don't know who's going to win this.
[151:38.69]Oh, you can crouch.
[151:39.91]I don't know who wins this.
[151:41.24]This is going to be fucked.
[151:42.52]Watch out.
[151:42.80]There's a mouse in here.
[151:44.24]How do you crouch?
[151:48.32]Double pep space.
[151:49.42]Alright.
[151:51.94]So this is a cool way to get into the bedroom.
[151:54.79]Alright.
[151:55.37]Yeah.
[151:55.79]We've got an upstairs.
[151:58.09]What is going on with this bathroom with the screen?
[152:00.61]And I have frogs everywhere.
[152:02.94]Yeah, this is our rust hideout, and this is where we keep all our resources.
[152:07.27]We got some wood, and we got the chest here.
[152:09.39]So we want to defend it, so we put it in the middle and built walls around it.
[152:12.54]Yeah, that's why it's so hard to get in downstairs.
[152:15.08]We do get raided every night from our neighbors.
[152:18.62]Yeah, they're sitting in there, man.
[152:21.47]Nope.
[152:23.45]Okay, so I get it.
[152:24.55]You hide your stuff.
[152:26.41]Your neighbors are a handful.
[152:29.84]We don't want this shit.
[152:31.06]It's not over yet.
[152:32.38]Where do you think me and Star have fun?
[152:33.92]We invite friends over, get to the back, and have a nice old LAN center.
[152:40.47]Yeah, and you've got a lot of computers.
[152:43.12]And these are rocking chairs, by the way.
[152:45.90]These are not comfortable.
[152:46.88]Those are grandma DX racers.
[152:48.80]It's new.
[152:50.67]All your boys just rocking out.
[152:53.96]Once you play Gran Turismo in one of these, you're going to change your mind.
[152:57.82]Okay, I have a point.
[153:03.05]I have to knock a few points off here because I've got a very important point.
[153:06.51]If you're in the middle of a LAN session with your boys, like you're saying, what happens if this guy's got to go to the bathroom?
[153:15.59]The amount of shit that has to be moved, all the people after... That's where the neighbors come in.
[153:23.08]So you just go across the street and go to the bathroom over there.
[153:26.45]What do you mean?
[153:27.57]Our bathroom's right here, too.
[153:28.67]What do you mean?
[153:29.27]I'm talking about if somebody is sitting here.
[153:30.95]You're talking about moving stuff?
[153:32.55]I'm talking about if I'm sitting here on the computer and I turn around, look at all these chairs.
[153:37.02]I'm going to sit here.
[153:38.30]This is you acting like, oh, I can't come over to your place for the sick-ass LAN party.
[153:42.16]What if I have to move things?
[153:43.98]You're wrong.
[153:44.28]That's not going to deter anyone to come over here.
[153:46.77]Oh, yeah, sorry, I couldn't come tonight.
[153:48.11]There might be something I have to move to go to the bathroom.
[153:51.15]Yeah.
[153:51.23]I don't want to be that guy that's why there's rocking chairs you can move them and you can see right here behind the kitchen there is space to get in there oh you can sneak back okay I get you I get you that's why the tables are not pushed against the wall okay so well I just want to say the toilet museum does have like land party accommodations if you just contact our director we can set that up anytime interesting okay so that is available yes
[154:16.58]I have to say that this is going to be very hard.
[154:21.34]I knew this was going to be one of the hardest ones because obviously I put all four of you together.
[154:25.33]I wanted there to be no nepotism from me, because obviously you're some of my closest friends.
[154:30.09]I mean, I've shared an ice cream with every single person in this call right now.
[154:33.52]We have.
[154:34.42]Absolutely.
[154:35.08]So this is going to be very hard.
[154:36.58]Not me.
[154:37.70]I will say that there's a lot of objects that are just kind of thrown everywhere.
[154:41.55]Why are there all these remotes on the ground?
[154:43.49]We can never find which one is the right one.
[154:45.61]So there's one for the VCR, there's one for Netflix, there's one for Hulu, and it's kind of a mess.
[154:50.66]It's not our fault.
[154:51.44]I think it's all the service providers are to blame.
[154:54.12]I have a rock outside.
[154:56.91]Dude, this shit had me fucked up.
[155:02.71]The fact that you've got all this, and you put the bike here, and then you put this here, and it's... Okay.
[155:08.98]Is there a backyard?
[155:09.88]Let me see the back.
[155:11.97]There is a rock outside.
[155:14.88]There's a rock.
[155:15.44]Have you seen the rock?
[155:16.96]I have not seen the rock yet.
[155:18.86]Just make a mental note.
[155:20.23]Who else will have a rock like this?
[155:22.05]Nobody.
[155:24.89]Okay.
[155:25.43]It is rust.
[155:25.83]We've got like seven rocks inside of our first little museum room.
[155:28.92]And we do have a bed.
[155:30.94]We're talking about an outdoor rock.
[155:32.18]We do have a bed.
[155:33.48]Let me go over here one more time.
[155:35.07]This is rough because I love both of these for very, very different reasons.
[155:42.44]These are both... You guys have a reception over here.
[155:46.80]You have a reception.
[155:49.04]That's crazy.
[155:50.71]That's crazy.
[155:51.15]You have a whole museum.
[155:52.47]You have like interactable objects and a whole story and... I don't want the land to be the thing that pushes it one way or the other.
[156:01.20]So I just want you to know, like I said, we do have access to the latrine access network, which... Alright.
[156:09.35]I got to make a decision.
[156:14.52]Thought we were making a beautiful home being added to the neighborhood.
[156:19.81]Have you seen the signs?
[156:25.34]Honestly, they're all going to be so hard.
[156:28.81]Creatively, I got to give it over to the right side here.
[156:31.89]It's just, you made a fucking toilet museum.
[156:35.26]Complexity, philosophy though, and structural integrity.
[156:42.01]But people are going to die here.
[156:43.31]I have to be honest with you, Ster and poke.
[156:44.91]People are going to die here.
[156:47.95]This is going to kill at least three people.
[156:49.60]That's going to kill at least two people.
[156:52.96]Have you seen any house in LA?
[156:55.59]We also sell health insurance.
[156:58.29]Every expensive house looks the same like that.
[157:00.11]They all are glass house and they all die.
[157:02.27]I have to just make a decision.
[157:03.92]They all have weird stairs that you wouldn't let your children on.
[157:06.70]You know what I'm talking about?
[157:09.24]All those rich houses have weird stairs that you wouldn't let your children on anyways.
[157:13.13]This is the same shit.
[157:15.67]I don't mind if they win so I can eat dinner.
[157:21.00]Well, now you can't.
[157:22.32]If we win, it can't be like, oh, Vinny gave it to me.
[157:26.81]It's a fucking amazing house.
[157:29.97]Alright, alright, alright.
[157:31.29]Here we go.
[157:32.76]I love both teams.
[157:33.52]I love you both.
[157:34.96]But I have to make a decision.
[157:36.20]And they're both A pluses.
[157:38.48]But how the fuck do you pick between two A pluses?
[157:40.87]You need to just fucking do it.
[157:44.83]Ugh.
[157:51.46]I can't do it.
[157:53.18]Stern poke wins.
[157:53.72]Wow.
[157:56.29]Ster and poke win.
[157:57.09]Congratulations.
[157:58.13]Now, if I didn't mention the dinner thing.
[158:02.94]Yeah, yeah.
[158:03.68]Is that a dinner difference?
[158:04.78]Was that a point one that was taken off for dinner?
[158:07.30]I don't know.
[158:07.82]That may have fucked me up.
[158:08.86]That may have fucked me up.
[158:13.25]But you guys, it was so fucking good, though.
[158:14.79]The toilet shit, the shit in the toilet.
[158:17.88]It's just... Oh, it was impossible.
[158:20.02]This is impossible.
[158:21.66]What do you think of the hill?
[158:23.96]The hill is the... Are you suggesting that Vinny might have flushed it for us?
[158:30.79]Possible.
[158:31.70]I think I might have.
[158:32.30]I'm suggesting.
[158:33.98]Oh, excellent.
[158:34.98]Excellent fucking work.
[158:36.60]Loved it.
[158:36.98]Both of you guys.
[158:37.58]I love both teams.
[158:38.63]You guys are great.
[158:39.59]Some of my closest friends.
[158:40.83]I love all four of you.
[158:46.15]What, what, what, what?
[158:48.06]No, because I'm here.
[158:49.20]No, no, no.
[158:49.78]Because I'm here and I was including myself weirdly, but I was like, it's not, it's four.
[158:53.30]That's a good cover.
[158:54.05]Then I'll accept that cover.
[158:55.77]No, I was including myself in this.
[158:58.19]Like, that was weird.
[158:58.93]Yeah, I never had ice cream with you.
[159:01.46]Alright.
[159:01.94]Thank you to Alex and Vinny.
[159:03.10]Wonderful job.
[159:03.68]But I just, there's something about these two fucking weirdos over here.
[159:08.95]okay it was always going to be so difficult and it was an amazing are you able to see custom stuff if I throw it in real quick or no I will not be able to see it damn but alright yeah alright I'll post it I'll send it to you let's I understand being a little wishy-washy and I was just watching helplessly as our chances circled the drain so so it's okay man it's a wonderful job yeah uh one of the top from last year so I'm sorry that your teammates sandbagged you
[159:38.16]no it's okay I would have been down to win thanks Jerma everybody good luck everyone the the toilet museum might have been the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life I know it was so good it was so good that's one of the best bits I've ever seen I'm gonna go take a dump in your honor
[159:57.77]Alright.
[159:58.23]So carry on our legacy.
[160:00.70]Fun fact, me and Polk, our first idea was to make a big toilet.
[160:04.11]I'm so glad we did.
[160:05.81]Let's do it.
[160:06.65]That would have been a cutie.
[160:08.62]Will stands and not right here.
[160:11.12]Yeah.
[160:11.91]Alright.
[160:13.09]You guys better not lose because I don't want to lose to a loser.
[160:17.25]I want to lose to a winner.
[160:19.03]Alright.
[160:19.69]I'm ready for a code.
[160:21.31]Who is the host of that?

[160:32.51]This one.
[160:33.33]We're getting through this.
[160:33.99]We're halfway there.

[160:38.91]Alright.
[160:40.38]I'm coming in.
[160:41.12]Somebody needs to drop who's not a host.
[160:45.44]I think Cutie left.
[160:47.05]Okay, cool.
[160:50.25]I might be wrong, though.

[161:08.85]Okay, that's integral to the process.
[161:10.87]Okay.
[161:12.10]Thank you.
[161:17.46]Okay, so where am I going first?
[161:22.04]Will you want to do one or do you need QB in there?
[161:25.57]You can go first if you'd like, he's already there.
[161:28.13]Okay, so am I in the right spot?
[161:30.52]Yeah, where are you?
[161:31.46]What's your name?
[161:32.02]Is your name Gone Fission?
[161:34.08]Shit, that is my name, right.
[161:35.46]Okay, just making sure that's not like an intruder in our home here.
[161:38.95]Stands here a little quiet.
[161:41.19]Let me turn you up a little.
[161:42.43]Oh, sorry.
[161:43.07]Hello?
[161:43.51]Testing.
[161:43.70]Testing.
[161:44.68]Where are you, Stanz, in here?
[161:46.52]I'm full volume on all my side.
[161:48.54]I'm just a bad streamer.
[161:49.52]Now it's better.
[161:50.24]Now it's better.
[161:51.37]Okay.
[161:52.01]Stanz and Andre, I don't mean to stack this against you.
[161:54.03]Just a heads up, Jerma, it's been like almost an hour, and you've done two out of the six matches.
[161:58.66]Feel free to do with that what you want.
[162:00.14]Just letting you know in case that is longer than you thought it would be.
[162:04.08]It is a little bit longer, so I appreciate the help.
[162:07.43]We can go quick.
[162:08.17]Time is money, and money is power.
[162:09.73]Yeah, thanks, Doug.
[162:10.19]I really appreciate your kindness and love.
[162:13.46]Your punctuality.
[162:14.25]I'm like last, dude.
[162:15.23]I'm the one struggling here.
[162:18.19]I see a subway.
[162:20.76]I'm sorry, but let us guide your third eye.
[162:24.65]Let us take you on a journey, Jeremy.
[162:26.63]Actually, Jeremy.
[162:27.28]Can I call you Jeremy?
[162:28.32]Is that okay?
[162:29.18]Are we on a first name basis here?
[162:31.06]because Jeremy we worked together we did yeah and we worked together and here's the deal we lost a lot of money so if there's one thing I know it is that we need in this neighborhood to make some money and that's why we licensed out this subway to the local marine corps air station alright
[162:51.13]Oh, can somebody share a screen?
[162:52.89]I'll share my screen.
[162:54.03]I'll share my screen.
[162:55.47]Thank you, Non.
[162:56.05]Thank you, Non.
[162:57.17]You might notice as you walk up a beautiful entryway, who knew that these Marines, they love flowers.
[163:02.44]This is an officially licensed subway.
[163:05.22]We can use the logo.
[163:06.26]We can use everything.
[163:07.36]We eat fresh.
[163:08.51]And we are not allowed to say the word Jared around here.
[163:10.67]So I want to be very clear.
[163:12.01]You cannot say Jared as you move through.
[163:14.25]We are not related to Jared Fogle at all.
[163:16.81]This is a way sub.
[163:17.57]This is a way sub, right?
[163:18.66]That's...
[163:18.96]uh yeah well I mean technically it is a subway because we're here to make money uh Jeremy we're here we're here to make a lot of money now I can see that you ran inside and Andre will take you through inside but I don't want you to miss the drive-through we have revolutionized the subway game you got a drive-through yes we have a drive-through you just ran inside bars right in our store this is a state-of-the-art subway in its construction we kept in mind
[163:42.01]The pillars of the home spirit, because creativity, complexity, philosophy and structural integrity do not just apply to the home.
[163:50.68]They also apply to the artistry of the sandwich.
[163:55.90]I love all this.
[163:56.62]That was beautifully spoken.
[163:58.20]But I will say that this is this is a neighborhood and I don't know if this is zoned for business.
[164:04.05]What's the last neighborhood you've been to that didn't have a subway?
[164:06.75]Imagine driving through a drive through and it's just houses and people have to deal with this shit.
[164:11.81]Oh, that's so funny.
[164:12.77]I mean, everyone likes a $5 footlong, and we're bringing them back right here, only in this location.
[164:17.49]Hey, check it out.
[164:19.90]If you were in a motorized vehicle, perhaps, and you went through our drive-thru, you could swing by our window to see one of our lovely sandwich artists slash military personnel at the window constructing perhaps your favorite sandwich, a seafood melt heavy on the lobster.
[164:39.29]Hold on, hold on a second.
[164:41.05]I'm pulling up.
[164:41.80]Hello.
[164:44.06]Well, I would love to have a tuna melt.
[164:51.03]Gently toasted with banana peppers.
[165:03.21]I'm here now.
[165:03.97]You shouldn't be on the microphone anymore.
[165:07.63]Sorry, we have Coke products.
[165:10.18]I didn't ask for a drink, but thank you.
[165:13.78]Okay, so that's good.
[165:14.91]I'm not talking about beverages.
[165:16.57]Alright, what about this?
[165:18.99]Alright, I see there's a ladder up here.
[165:21.10]What's going on?
[165:22.26]There's a ladder up here for our VIP clients.
[165:24.42]We're talking, you know, the big five at the Pentagon.
[165:26.90]We obviously have to have a helipad.
[165:30.83]I mean, if you're going to bring in maybe the commander in chief comes through here.
[165:36.36]Sometimes he does.
[165:37.12]He's going to land here on the helipad.
[165:38.36]We have to make sure to secure the area, but he can get in and get his foot long from, again, our sandwich artists that are also members of the armed forces.
[165:46.02]We're really looking forward to more high ranking military members to come to our restaurant so we could take pictures of them holding their sandwiches and post them on the wall.
[165:55.53]Yeah, that's what we do here.
[165:56.77]There's lots of pictures on the wall, but we haven't had many customers because we're just opening.
[166:00.33]Excellent.
[166:01.63]If we could take you inside, we wanted to capture both a modern 2025 aesthetic, but pay homage to the subway of classic memory.
[166:12.80]We used the same color scheme as the 90s subway, but we brought in elements of Dadaism and modern principles of architecture
[166:25.90]to make sure that we don't feel like we're stuck in the past, but propelling forward to the future.
[166:31.67]You have a pizza oven.
[166:33.31]Well, they do flatbreads now.
[166:34.29]I don't know if you've been to Subway in a while.
[166:36.28]Oh, okay.
[166:36.58]Interesting.
[166:37.08]We do flatbreads at this establishment.
[166:38.84]We wanted to make sure if we're toasted, we're toasting that bad boy real good.
[166:43.25]Okay.
[166:43.75]Very cool.
[166:44.31]Very cool.
[166:45.42]You might not have noticed when you walked in, because I did see you ran straight to the register.
[166:48.75]You're a hungry little boy.
[166:50.29]HVAC, central cooling and heating up here.
[166:52.96]And I will say, if you've ever installed that, very hard to rotate.
[166:55.78]So please give us a little credit.
[166:58.10]Actually, kind of.
[166:59.13]That's a shame.
[167:01.97]I haven't seen any HVAC yet.
[167:05.06]So that's a big deal.
[167:06.26]Okay.
[167:07.14]Not to mention, we have a state-of-the-art bathroom.
[167:10.39]This is one of those glass doors that when you close it, it tints up and we can't see you inside.
[167:15.32]Yeah, so don't worry.
[167:16.27]It is private.
[167:17.09]If you want to go, feel free.
[167:18.99]It might not look like it, but it frosts up.
[167:20.88]Didn't even have that at the toilet museum.
[167:23.78]Alright, this is wonderful.
[167:25.60]First of all, you made a restaurant, you made a drive-through.
[167:28.86]I'll have to keep all that in consideration.
[167:30.95]Can I say that, Jeremy?
[167:31.73]We made a dream for not only you, but the whole neighborhood to eat fresh, and the money goes back into the local community.
[167:37.39]We sponsor some t-ball teams, some baseball teams.
[167:39.79]Very good.
[167:40.29]We also sponsor the airsoft team because this is military.
[167:43.22]We don't like it, but we have to do it.
[167:44.76]General says we must.
[167:45.96]And so if you don't support this, I mean, kids are going hungry.
[167:49.56]Okay, alright, I'll keep that in mind.
[167:51.75]We have a strong focus on high-quality ingredients and preparation methods.
[167:57.25]We have an indoor full barbecue offset smoker.
[168:01.74]Are you reading off of the website?
[168:03.48]Are you reading off of the website?
[168:04.43]Actually, this was Andre's choice.
[168:05.95]He does have a full smoker in the back.
[168:08.27]I wanted to make real barbecue smoked turkey because you're poultry, baby.
[168:13.96]You're foul, and I want you to know.
[168:17.07]oh my god this is ridiculous this is wonderful we have a whole entire drawer of pickles alright uh anything else to see or are we moving can we move on to the next house
[168:27.72]You can move on.
[168:29.78]Don't forget about the drive-thru.
[168:30.78]I feel like you took a stroll around it.
[168:32.23]No, no.
[168:32.41]The drive-thru is my favorite part.
[168:33.45]This took a lot of flooring and it's evenly spaced all the way across.
[168:37.36]This is my favorite part of the whole thing.
[168:38.80]This is like the best part of the whole thing.
[168:40.38]I just see cars driving up here and it's like there's somebody potentially out here in their backyard like having a barbecue.
[168:46.64]That would be an experience.
[168:49.69]I mean, why cook when you live next to a subway is all I'm saying.
[168:52.03]That would be actually kind of fucking cool.
[168:54.07]Pulling up to the barbecue with a party sub, cut that bad boy into tenths.
[168:58.74]You're going to be the belle of the ball.
[169:00.10]Everybody's going to want to be your best friend.
[169:01.80]That's 20 feet of party sub, Jeremy.
[169:02.62]20 feet of sandwich.
[169:03.90]Oh, my God.
[169:04.44]You guys are too much.
[169:05.27]Alright.
[169:05.67]That was fucking wonderful.
[169:06.67]Thank you.
[169:07.15]That was Stans and Andre's restaurant subway.
[169:11.67]Yep.
[169:12.93]Sub Warp.
[169:14.92]Here, we have to bring somebody back in.
[169:18.30]Is Cutie not here?
[169:20.25]I can just watch.
[169:21.77]Will can just guide it.
[169:24.01]But I'll talk.
[169:24.98]Well, he'll talk.
[169:25.66]We'll both talk.
[169:28.08]Alright.
[169:28.92]This is gorgeous.
[169:29.94]This is fucking gorgeous, by the way.
[169:32.09]Well, before you go in, Jeremiah, I just want to give you a few ground rules things, okay?
[169:37.29]Okay.
[169:38.30]We call ourselves Cutie and He Home Remodeling, right?
[169:42.72]And we've had a lot of success in the neighborhood and we wanted to show you a complete project that we made for a very specific client.
[169:50.64]Okay.
[169:51.70]This is actually Elmo's home.
[169:55.30]Elmo from yes from that street yeah uh doge recently uh defunded a lot of pbs's efforts and so Elmo's had a lot more free time and he wanted to move into more of a residential setting uh in fact hang on he left you a voicemail hang on let me play this real quick
[170:16.98]Yeah, Elmo's home.
[170:19.03]Hello, Jerma.
[170:20.15]Welcome to Elmo home.
[170:22.04]Before you go in, you must sign an NDA, Jerma.
[170:25.97]You must sign an NDA.
[170:28.37]And if you leak anything you see in there, Elmo fucking kill you.
[170:33.82]Yeah, so unfortunately, we are going to need you to sign an NDA.
[170:40.64]Sorry.
[170:41.08]He takes that very seriously.
[170:42.66]He's a very private person.
[170:44.31]We worked too hard to lose this.
[170:46.43]Yeah, this is binding.
[170:47.61]This is a binding document.
[170:49.12]You understand that, right?
[170:51.76]Let me sign this.
[170:52.54]It's standard.
[170:53.30]It's pretty boilerplate stuff.
[170:55.03]It looks like there's some red ink on that.
[170:57.77]I don't know.
[170:58.43]Right, and we're going to need the thumbprint there.
[171:01.56]Yep.
[171:01.66]OK, and we're going to need your social security number there.
[171:05.30]We're going to bang through this real fast.
[171:06.75]Of course.
[171:07.21]OK, and initial this page.
[171:09.87]That one, yep.
[171:11.14]Yeah, okay, and we're going to need some hair follicles on this page.
[171:15.08]Just tape them to the page.
[171:16.33]Okay, sure.
[171:16.87]Just yank them out.
[171:18.49]Pubis or hair, doesn't matter.
[171:20.46]Alright, we're all signed up.
[171:22.16]Let's get you in this home.
[171:24.29]Let's go, okay.
[171:24.61]Can you tell them about the outside, will you?
[171:26.59]So the most important thing for us when designing this landscape is to make it approachable for trick-or-treaters.
[171:33.02]That was something that we were really excited about.
[171:36.79]I am, I come from, I'm a landscaper's daughter.
[171:39.73]And so this is something that I really spent a lot of time on.
[171:43.62]And I'm just, you can see, just honestly, the energy that our estate attracts is just wholesome and inviting.
[171:50.76]It's very inviting.
[171:51.31]Everything you could want.
[171:52.81]Thank you.
[171:53.51]and this is Elmo did Elmo specifically uh ask for some of these different plants and flowers or yeah we actually have a voicemail hang on let me play that oh okay I want the house to look inviting no one should suspect anything about what Elmo is doing inside do you hear me do you hear Elmo almost a celebrity
[172:17.91]That one just kind of cuts off there.
[172:19.40]That just kind of cuts off there.
[172:21.02]Yeah, I imagine.
[172:22.09]And I do anything to make my clients happy, so.
[172:24.78]That's right.
[172:25.54]So let's go ahead and step inside.
[172:27.05]Cutie, let's tell them about this interior.
[172:29.98]Yes.
[172:32.24]Okay.
[172:34.82]His favorite color is red, you might think, and his favorite texture is fur, as you might be able to tell.
[172:40.41]He does plan on having many people over, and so we've prepared a lovely turkey and lobster dinner for him.
[172:48.59]He does have a private chef that we asked to leave for this.
[172:52.36]Yeah, they're working on a charcuterie.
[172:55.16]Before you go in the back of the bathroom.
[172:58.40]I haven't seen anything?
[172:59.62]so uh this is a beautiful beautiful full bath you can see cutie really did an amazing job it's so inviting now we do our best to make our clients happy and this next section uh was a special request this was called Elmo's hot spoon room um man uh we have a voicemail hang on I'm gonna play it
[173:26.47]in his hot spoon room.
[173:29.56]Elmo like to feel good.
[173:31.79]Make you feel nice for Elmo.
[173:34.62]Oh, fuck.
[173:36.49]Elmo love that.
[173:38.77]Yeah, and then that one kind of trailed off, but it looks scattered and it doesn't look intentional, but everything here was specified in writing.
[173:51.54]So this is Elmo's hot spoon room.
[173:53.89]Alright, alright.
[173:54.79]And I'm imagining this is probably...
[173:57.56]uh for um heating up spoons because he's playing because he's you know it's fun right that's I don't think it's a hobby on Sesame Street okay I think Elmo spends more time in the street of Sesame Street than we really ever understood let's go to the upstairs shall we let's go get a look at that game room
[174:20.98]let's go to a game room alright you've got a land party potentially oh yeah you can see we got a nice steep staircase here and we have a railing to protect people from falling down is big deal safe right exactly and here's Elmo's game room can you tell them about the game room um Elmo likes to play games with his friends that's right um and so we wanted to keep an area for that uh that was also warm and inviting and you know who doesn't love a good game time yeah
[174:51.42]so we loved making this room we loved it so much almost as much as we hated making the next room let's go ahead and take a look at Elmo's bedroom this feels like instruments by the way he's got you got the piano you've got the drum set this is the bedroom
[175:05.48]Yeah, let's take a step behind the curtain here.
[175:07.88]What the fuck is going on?
[175:10.16]The HOA is going to be very upset about this house.
[175:13.17]Let's take a look behind the curtain.
[175:16.03]Oh, my God.
[175:16.29]This was all very specifically the amount of baby oil, the fluid bucket, the...
[175:26.32]the quadra penetrator on the ground.
[175:29.90]That was my only question.
[175:30.82]I'm sorry.
[175:31.18]If you wouldn't laugh, we do try to uphold the utmost professionalism with our clients.
[175:36.57]Yeah, you'll notice all the cameras and the sound equipment.
[175:39.07]We actually have another voicemail.
[175:40.95]This one, I'll play it for you.
[175:57.03]okay let's go ahead and write that let's go ahead and write that down so uh that's that that was that was one of the last calls we received from we actually got one here's one more call we got this I this one wasn't from Elmo but I think Elmo gave this person our number okay
[176:16.32]Elmo, you owe the count one, two, three thousand dollars.
[176:23.51]If you don't have my money, I'm going to expose the island you are on.
[176:28.88]It begins with the letter E.
[176:34.27]This is fucked up.
[176:35.58]This is one of the most fucked up things I've ever seen.
[176:38.68]Yeah, so we don't really know what that meant or who that was from.
[176:42.24]But anyway, we love this modern home.
[176:45.73]It's a take on modern luxury.
[176:48.21]And that bathroom really is something, isn't it?
[176:50.41]I can't help noticing you went back into the bedroom.
[176:53.36]I just can't believe what I'm seeing over there.
[176:55.52]as the rest of the house.
[176:56.74]Let's ignore that.
[176:57.61]Let's take a look at this game room, right?
[176:59.21]We got Street Fighter over here.
[177:02.68]We got Turtles in Time, and we got The Simpsons.
[177:05.55]Who doesn't love that?
[177:07.11]Oh, that's my favorite one.
[177:08.64]That's right.
[177:11.28]oh my god okay uh well anyway we know you got a strict 10 minutes let's get you out of here before you look at that bedroom again let's get you out of here this is let's go ahead and get you down the stairs this is going to be either the easiest or the hardest decision of the day and I'll tell you a few reasons why this is first of all unbelievable bull I'm a landscaper's daughter so thank you this is the sponsor stream so we're glad that we could bring a celebrity like Elmo to really support the House Flipper project
[177:40.88]Okay, you did make a good, a very wonderful house.
[177:44.93]Thank you.
[177:46.53]The structural integrity is there, the creativity is there.
[177:48.81]Leaving the voicemails is fucking huge.
[177:50.93]I love the outside.
[177:51.92]It actually took a lot of time to probably put all this here.
[177:55.30]It probably took a lot of time to do the street here too, though.
[177:58.74]Thank you, Chef.
[178:01.81]It's always going to be hard.
[178:04.55]Let me take one more quick look around here.
[178:05.97]The zoning laws of this...
[178:10.46]to man just just beautiful doesn't it just fill your you got a lot of decisions and this is a sponsored stream so
[178:22.66]To be a little bit too much of a brand liability Forget about the sponsor forget it we're talking about the Twitch terms of service Fucking drug whatever room
[178:43.13]hot spoon room you signed an nda drug lightning hot he eats a lot of gelato and he needs the spoons to cut through the gelato fast okay any other insinuation is purely speculation
[179:04.33]I think it's cocaine, I'm going to be honest.
[179:08.05]I love them both.
[179:08.91]They're both incredible.
[179:10.08]So far, they've been so good.
[179:13.62]So good.
[179:14.08]Without any custom content, custom images, it's surprising how amazing these actually have been.
[179:20.75]You guys have done a phenomenal job, everybody.
[179:22.95]Thank you.
[179:26.15]This house is wicked fucked up.
[179:28.93]The left house is wicked fucked up.
[179:30.81]It's beautiful.
[179:31.45]Does it help if I tell you my mom's watching me?
[179:35.34]This one is not.
[179:36.22]The one on the right is not a house.
[179:37.82]It is a dream.
[179:39.12]I love the story with making the money.
[179:41.94]It's a beautiful lot.
[179:43.13]The structure is there.
[179:44.35]There's a lot of interior.
[179:45.51]A lot of work went into doing the street and the road and the drive-thru.
[179:49.91]Hey, I'll just sit here.
[179:52.18]Don't worry.
[179:52.80]On this beautiful swing.
[179:54.06]Enjoying.
[179:55.68]It's okay.
[179:56.52]You can give it to the subway.
[179:58.77]You need to get out.
[180:00.01]He's judging right now.
[180:02.05]It's the judging section.

[180:15.85]This one was beautiful.
[180:16.93]It was wonderful.
[180:17.79]I think Elmo might have been too much for him.
[180:20.34]I'm going to have to tell my dad that my landscaping wasn't good enough, I guess.
[180:24.58]The landscaping was beautiful.
[180:26.56]It's crazy.
[180:26.88]I'm a landscaper's daughter after all, so he's going to be really sad.
[180:30.41]Well, it's time to trim.
[180:31.59]You tell that piece of shit.
[180:36.40]I don't want to be on this fucking show anyway.

[181:56.13]Actually, something interesting.
[181:57.82]And this is a crazy fucking segue.
[181:59.82]And I'm not kidding that this is a segue.
[182:03.12]House Flipper just announced.
[182:05.11]This is an insane segue.
[182:06.33]Subway DLC.
[182:07.21]House Flipper just announced.
[182:09.59]Right now, House Flipper is teaming up with Scooby-Doo.
[182:15.37]Scooby Doo, the whole gang and the mystery machine are coming to House Flipper.
[182:21.70]You know what's crazy about that?
[182:24.18]What a fucked up segway!
[182:26.24]I am so glad you didn't do Scooby-Doo.
[182:28.35]I'm so glad you didn't do Scooby-Doo.
[182:30.51]Will, do you have another voicemail on your machine?
[182:33.27]No, no, no, don't do that.
[182:34.19]Don't do that.
[182:34.83]Don't do that.
[182:37.80]Don't do that.
[182:39.34]Don't do that.
[182:41.74]We're moving on.
[182:43.44]We're moving on.
[182:44.54]We're moving on to the next house.
[182:46.49]Alright, does anybody of the four... Okay, who's under more of a... We're going to knock them.
[182:50.49]We've got two more left.
[182:52.83]Who is going next?
[182:53.67]We'll see you in the next round.
[182:54.63]Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.
[182:55.96]We have... We do have three left.
[182:58.36]Okay, so does anybody want to get theirs done?
[183:00.90]Because they need something they've got to do.
[183:04.83]These have been fucking hysterical, by the way.
[183:06.39]Doug, you want to go?
[183:08.92]Yeah, because you're... Yeah, we're on yours here.
[183:11.44]Maybe.
[183:12.04]Get you out a little.
[183:13.00]We'll get the EU out.
[183:13.86]Oh, nice.
[183:14.66]Listen, Jerma, I want a stipulation on my round, okay?
[183:17.61]Okay.
[183:18.87]Because, you know, I love having my eye sockets bleed from exhaustion at 5 a.m.
[183:23.06]after watching, you know, what is the estimate here?
[183:25.76]29 hours?
[183:26.52]So I want you to make me loose.
[183:29.29]I don't care.
[183:30.07]I don't care about the points.
[183:30.97]Just disqualify me.
[183:32.77]In fact, disqualify me now.
[183:34.43]Fuck it, okay?
[183:36.16]But I'm still showing my house.
[183:37.72]Okay.
[183:38.40]Alright.
[183:38.66]Well, let's get the room code in.
[183:40.56]Let's get this set up.
[183:41.19]Let's get going.
[183:43.91]Doug, what level did you get to, Doug?
[183:47.69]Sorry, say that again?
[183:49.05]What?
[183:49.45]What level did you get to on Peggle?
[183:52.36]Four.
[183:52.76]You're ahead of me.
[183:53.66]Oh, okay.
[183:54.22]I was 1-5.
[183:54.66]Okay, cool, cool, cool.
[183:58.50]Alright.
[183:59.47]Do you have the code?
[184:01.63]I'm joining right now.
[184:03.43]Okay.
[184:03.69]I'm in the game.
[184:04.23]It should be reloading.
[184:10.20]Dude, what a fucked up segue.
[184:11.56]But yeah, Scooby-Doo is coming to House Flipper.
[184:15.34]That's crazy.
[184:17.59]I don't know.
[184:20.12]We don't have any previous tenants here, okay?
[184:24.72]It's as you see, as you go.
[184:26.79]Alright, where are we starting?
[184:30.65]Why don't you come to our side?
[184:32.03]We'll start on ours.
[184:33.82]Do you want to start with what you personally made?
[184:37.90]You really wanted this thing in here.
[184:40.77]Alright, what is this?
[184:42.39]Is this Joel's house?
[184:44.04]What?
[184:44.44]No, no, no.
[184:45.52]This is Point Crow and Dug Dug.
[184:48.40]Okay.
[184:48.70]Alright.
[184:49.02]So first on my way to come into this room, and I want to make sure that you look straight forward.
[184:53.99]Do not look down and just kind of walk forward.
[184:56.33]Okay.
[184:56.51]I would just walk forward.
[184:58.55]Sorry to interrupt.
[184:59.11]Is there a screen share?
[185:00.62]Oh.
[185:01.54]Alright.
[185:01.78]Let me screen share.
[185:02.52]I can do it.
[185:04.56]Okay.
[185:04.80]We get a screen share.
[185:05.90]I need to walk forward and don't.
[185:08.52]What the fuck just happened?
[185:09.76]Are we good?
[185:10.19]Okay.
[185:10.55]We good.
[185:10.97]Open this door and walk forward.
[185:12.49]This is our trap room.
[185:17.68]In case you want to go through.
[185:21.46]What was your inspiration behind this, Doug?
[185:24.13]I feel like the world is at danger with how close Jerma is to us, and this is a chance to finally trap him once and for all.
[185:30.94]Yes.
[185:32.22]Next up, Jerma, we would like to show you the... This was my creation, actually.
[185:38.10]The shit puddle we made.
[185:39.25]Yeah, you wanted bathrooms, correct?
[185:41.67]So I thought, what better idea than to have all of nature outside with you together?
[185:47.26]If you really want to... What is better than the world out there?
[185:52.09]This is what we have.
[185:54.67]This is all we have.
[185:56.05]Yeah, and I love the slide.
[185:57.25]So you're going to get up here and you're going to...
[185:59.82]What's life without fun?
[186:01.29]Exactly.
[186:04.71]How exactly do we feed the shit pool?
[186:07.50]Well, that's where this pipe, I guess.
[186:10.02]Yeah.
[186:10.34]And this was Doug's pipe.
[186:11.77]From this building.
[186:13.69]So this building is, boy, you're going to love this one, Jerma.
[186:16.74]Why don't you go and open up and let's see what I made.
[186:19.06]I love what Doug did with this one.
[186:23.84]What is this?
[186:25.95]What is this?
[186:26.43]Yeah, Doug, you want to explain what this one is?
[186:30.65]Sometimes you want to get it all.
[186:33.54]A massage, a chiropractor appointment, a dump, all of it.
[186:38.59]Okay.
[186:38.85]And also this is, I guess there's a stream room too.
[186:41.43]There's a microphone.
[186:42.75]Notice how there are braces specifically in case you, you know, you got some high fiber diet.
[186:48.74]And you might be looking at this and thinking, this seems like the type of fucked up room that Joel actually made.
[186:53.09]And Doug and Eric have no idea what's going on here.
[186:55.17]However, this is my brainchild, where I strapped Point Curl up here for about 45 of the 50 building minutes, and he just screamed out in pain.
[187:04.45]Okay, so you tortured him for 45 minutes an hour?
[187:07.97]Yeah, and that's where the poop came from.
[187:10.09]Interesting.
[187:11.22]And that goes through here, you're saying?
[187:14.11]Yeah.
[187:15.05]Let me take a look.
[187:16.03]Yeah.
[187:16.61]I believe that there's a hole.
[187:18.01]Yeah.
[187:18.94]It looks like maybe a speaker hole.
[187:21.82]Okay.
[187:22.70]So this is going on here.
[187:23.98]And that goes out here through here.
[187:27.15]Hold on.
[187:27.37]I'm going to talk to my neighbors real quick over the fence.
[187:29.01]Hey, Joel.
[187:29.83]Hey, neighbor Joel.
[187:30.71]Joel, you want to come over here real quick?
[187:31.90]What exactly was going on with the hole in the back?
[187:35.40]Oh, the hole in the back, that's from, like, from what I assume when you guys were building it!
[187:40.55]Oh!
[187:40.63]I thought you guys were, like, making a shit, shit pipe from the shit bowl!
[187:43.90]Oh, that makes sense!
[187:45.50]Into the torture room!
[187:46.16]Perfumes!
[187:46.36]Okay, so anyway, um, getting back to the- I think that was it!
[187:48.89]I think that was it, but I'm not sure!
[187:50.57]Alright, alright, thanks, thanks, we're good!
[187:51.79]Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you!
[187:53.17]Hope you guys win!
[187:54.79]This is a fucking church!
[187:56.06]What is happening?
[187:57.76]Let's make sure there's a pipe that could go into... Look, what we really wanted to show you, and if you could play some dramatic music to build this up.
[188:08.11]Yeah, this is exactly what we want to show you.
[188:09.92]This is the big one, okay?
[188:11.30]Come over here, Jeremiah.
[188:14.38]This is too much.
[188:15.16]This room is where we put it all, okay?
[188:18.01]Everything you've dreamed of, get ready.
[188:19.33]personally for you, and you should take this one actually personally.
[188:23.95]What you think about Doug and I is what this room is inside.
[188:28.02]We know exactly what's in here, right?
[188:30.14]Isn't that right?
[188:30.82]Isn't that right, neighbor?
[188:31.50]We know exactly what's in here.
[188:33.68]Yeah.
[188:34.20]Yeah.
[188:34.78]Keep going in there.
[188:35.92]And I'll tell you what, you guys did an amazing job considering that theoretically, maybe just one person had to do it, but keep going.
[188:45.19]It's going to be great.
[188:46.79]Go!
[188:49.11]Without further ado, I would love for you to open this
[188:53.40]Okay, and this is a bucket.
[188:55.86]This is a bucket.
[188:56.96]Wow.
[188:57.46]You know, I think I speak for everyone when I say a really excellent finish.
[189:01.73]It really all came together at the end there.
[189:03.87]Yeah, yeah.
[189:04.95]There is one more thing, though.
[189:06.17]There is one more thing.
[189:07.75]Uh-huh.
[189:07.91]Right?
[189:08.21]And it's, you know, going with the theme of nature, being yourself, and, like, not being trapped down by the proletariat, you know?
[189:15.88]Uh-huh.
[189:16.78]And it's up here.
[189:18.32]This.
[189:18.92]The treehouse.
[189:20.78]Okay.
[189:20.90]Yep.
[189:21.62]Okay.
[189:22.01]So if you ever want...
[189:23.39]Yeah, if you ever want to really observe nature as it is, you can take a shit while...
[189:30.73]Looking at the TV, you know?
[189:32.63]Play Frog Traffic on the FS7 and really vibe.
[189:38.26]And some neighbor across the street might say that there's a Switch 2 inside with $50 on the table!
[189:45.41]But I want to know anything about that!
[189:47.91]We put a Switch 2 on the table and there's $50.
[189:51.08]Yeah, that's exactly what we did.
[189:53.54]Both of us.
[189:58.43]Oh, you're killing me.
[189:59.68]okay so this dug dug and point crow this home is phenomenal thank you excellent excellent I absolutely am understanding that this was made by the two of you
[190:11.36]And very well, well done.
[190:13.76]I, yeah, of course.
[190:15.57]Of course you made the shit go to the bathroom section and a fall down section.
[190:23.39]How do you crouch?
[190:23.89]How do you crouch?
[190:26.10]Cube.
[190:27.24]I didn't mean to do that.
[190:28.26]I don't know what that is.
[190:29.66]Oh, that's our shit pool that we made.
[190:31.78]Oh, yeah, that's our shit pool.
[190:33.12]Excellent work.
[190:34.00]Very, very well made.
[190:35.54]And I mean, is there anything else to see on this home?
[190:39.48]You know, neighbor Joel.
[190:41.46]Hey, Joel!
[190:42.50]Hey, what's up?
[190:43.94]Hey, what's up?
[190:45.12]Can we come check out your home?
[190:47.11]Yeah, that would be great!
[190:48.55]In fact, you know, I'm kind of losing my mind and my lungs right now, but you guys did an excellent job!
[190:55.06]Holy shit!
[190:56.96]Anyway, Jeremiah, get over to the neighbor!
[191:02.78]I think we've shown everything out.
[191:04.66]Oh, excellent.
[191:05.42]Alright.
[191:05.74]So then this is Joel's house.
[191:10.31]Me.
[191:11.09]Yeah, I have no idea.
[191:12.55]Doug and I are seeing this for the first time.
[191:14.15]Okay.
[191:14.69]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[191:15.44]It's crazy, but, you know, whatever.
[191:18.42]But, Jerma, please, ladies and gentlemen, this is, of course, a tarmac.
[191:23.90]And what you're about to see is not a house, but an experience, ladies and gentlemen.
[191:28.43]This is a Virgin Chairlines.
[191:31.03]Okay.
[191:31.43]Jeremiah, why don't you take a seat inside the plane and let me show you what it's like to fly for real.
[191:37.83]By the way, you might be saying, hey, that chair is a real piece of shit.
[191:41.32]That's a logo.
[191:42.90]That's painted on the side.
[191:44.57]It's painted.
[191:46.33]He painted it on the side.
[191:47.63]This is a logo.
[191:49.88]It's almost like there's a collaborative spirit going on here because of constraints.
[191:55.44]But that's fine.
[191:57.26]Jeremiah, why don't you please take a seat?
[192:00.29]Is there a door?
[192:03.73]Fall over here, Jeremiah.
[192:06.64]And please hold on.
[192:09.10]What is your boarding group?
[192:11.30]C. Please hold on.
[192:15.39]Okay, we'll now be welcoming first class Point Crow passengers.
[192:17.86]Point Crow, please go home.
[192:19.64]Thank you so much.
[192:21.71]Okay.
[192:21.83]And now anyone with a child or small animal?
[192:24.51]I don't have one of those.
[192:27.52]And the pours.
[192:28.86]Go ahead.
[192:29.20]Get in there.
[192:31.34]Ew.
[192:31.88]Alright.
[192:32.49]Okay.
[192:33.91]Sorry.
[192:34.13]I just smelled some pour outside the plane.
[192:37.01]Okay.
[192:37.63]Jeremiah, why don't you take a seat?
[192:39.92]Because, ladies and gentlemen... Do I get to sit in first class?
[192:43.18]Can I sit in first class?
[192:44.04]No, there's no real class here at all.
[192:46.10]You would have boarded earlier if there was... Anyway, anyway, Jeremy, because this is more of an experience rather than actually flying, because this is very compatible with people that have fear of flying.
[192:56.22]So I'm going to need you to grab your chair right now.
[192:59.32]Grab it and start vibrating like this, okay?
[193:02.36]Okay, alright.
[193:04.55]Here we go.
[193:07.47]This is takeoff, right?
[193:12.96]This is takeoff?
[193:15.40]If you yawn, your ears will pop.
[193:19.81]Ah, shit.
[193:21.85]My tray table's not up.
[193:23.11]My tray table's not up.
[193:25.02]Alright.
[193:30.07]Are we in the air?
[193:35.11]Uh, Captain?
[193:35.95]Are you alive, or...?
[193:45.61]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard the Virgin Airlines.
[193:48.63]The airline voted most likely to make you question your life choices.
[193:53.58]This is flight 404.
[193:55.18]Our estimated flight time is... fuckin' long.
[193:58.77]Honestly, we're not even sure.
[194:00.65]I'm your pilot, Joey, using Google Maps on my baby pink iPad.
[194:05.14]We're still waiting on Wi-Fi.
[194:06.62]That doesn't exist.
[194:08.57]As a reminder, Virgin Chairlines is a budget carrier because everything is extra.
[194:13.11]Corn on snacks is in a bucket.
[194:15.82]$50.
[194:16.36]Water.
[194:19.53]Please can you take care of your kid?
[194:49.51]I know the bathroom earns a lot of points
[195:11.74]Oh yeah, the bathroom.
[195:13.58]Here's the deal, right?
[195:14.74]Going to the bathroom is $49.99.
[195:16.73]We only take Venmo, which isn't connected to the Wi-Fi.
[195:20.07]It's a tough shit, penis.
[195:22.92]In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, a mask will not drop from the ceiling because, spoiler alert, the fucking ceiling looks like a bathroom.
[195:31.41]And speaking of bathrooms, you figure it out.
[195:34.54]Anyway, my name is Joey.
[195:36.36]I've flown maybe once or twice, but that's good enough for you, Jeremy.
[195:40.54]Anyway, you might also notice we have a bike rental outside.
[195:43.92]Listen, a lot of other premium airlines like Spirit Airlines, they just aren't very forward thinking.
[195:49.95]So we said, fuck it.
[195:51.27]Here's a bike rental for 50 bucks.
[195:53.65]You get some cardio so you don't feel so jet lagged.
[195:56.06]We have a trust system, by the way.
[195:57.34]You slap 50 bucks on there and let's just trust each other.
[196:00.16]All, you know.
[196:02.58]Hey, check out that corn bucket thing.
[196:04.36]It's great.
[196:05.49]Anyway, on behalf of everyone... It's take a corn, leave a corn, you know?
[196:10.05]Yeah, it's precious.
[196:11.19]Check that out.
[196:11.70]Of course.
[196:13.16]Alright.
[196:14.48]Anyway, on behalf of everyone at Virgins Airlines, thank you for flying with us.
[196:18.29]The weather outside...
[196:20.08]Well, it sure looks like shit.
[196:22.32]Anyway, there's a gun in the bathroom if you feel like, you know, doing some counterterrorism or something.
[196:28.55]She's threatening.
[196:29.63]Anyway, speaking of shit, you know you have many options on flying, and we appreciate you clearly made the wrong one.
[196:35.10]So sit back, relax, or don't, the chairs don't recline, and enjoy your flight, penis.
[196:40.16]Where does this go?
[196:45.33]Close that door.
[196:46.87]Close that door.
[196:47.65]I don't want to go out there.
[196:49.09]I don't want to go out there.
[196:49.97]Whatever's out there, I don't want to be out there.
[196:53.82]Okay.
[196:54.82]Well, it looks like we've landed.
[196:56.90]Go ahead and head towards the aisles.
[196:58.93]Make your way slowly one at a time.
[197:00.25]Thank you so much for flying.
[197:01.57]Thank you.
[197:01.95]What an experience.
[197:03.11]What an experience.
[197:03.63]Virgin Airlines.
[197:04.54]Okay.
[197:05.16]Excellent.
[197:05.66]Wow.
[197:06.14]Hey, I can't believe we took that.
[197:07.32]That was a quick flight.
[197:09.31]okay um wow what oh wow what just happened but uh this is a this is a wow I don't I don't know what to do here because this is crazy um I can I ask a question sure go ahead sure how do I grade this
[197:32.47]I feel like you're the HOA president, right?
[197:34.58]I feel like that's your entire job that you have one job.
[197:38.11]I mean, OK, so
[197:43.33]This section over here is good.
[197:47.77]It was funny.
[197:49.58]Thank you.
[197:50.62]Dog, whatever you guys did.
[197:53.58]Come on, son.
[197:54.80]Okay, so the question is, I love the fucking shit pool.
[198:00.23]I love the pool next to the shit pool.
[198:02.39]Thank you.
[198:02.62]I mean, you made a whole airline over here.
[198:07.20]This is an entire airline.
[198:07.92]And Joel did that by himself.
[198:09.49]And Joel did this by himself.
[198:11.78]Yeah, yeah.
[198:12.34]And it's almost like, you know, sometimes the neighbors help each other because, you know, one of them had a major disadvantage and, you know, they knew they were going to lose.
[198:18.55]So they just said, fuck it.
[198:20.41]Okay.
[198:20.53]But it doesn't matter.
[198:21.63]And just quick, quick, just so you're aware, there is an actual proper plumbing system.
[198:24.99]If you come outside the plane over here, check out behind the back end of the bathroom.
[198:30.44]While we're flying, it just kind of takes care of itself.
[198:32.95]Oh, excellent.
[198:34.58]Very, very cool.
[198:35.14]You'll need plumbing.
[198:36.60]We're very eco-aware here.
[198:39.26]I'm going to award the victory over... I'm going to award it to the Virgin Chairlines.
[198:47.71]That was wonderful.
[198:49.75]I feel like you all maybe collaborated on this, maybe?
[198:54.22]No.
[198:55.08]So, the question is... So, two of you need to move on.
[198:59.66]Two of you need to move on.
[199:03.41]uh who who what two of you are moving on uh who who what two of you are moving on uh who who what two of you are moving on I have a question Joel what time is I have a question Joel what time is I have a question Joel what time is it in Sweden uh it's it's midnight so it in Sweden uh it's it's midnight so it in Sweden uh it's it's midnight so I woke up the entire neighborhood with I woke up the entire neighborhood with I woke up the entire neighborhood with my uh okay you know you're flying my point is uh here's what my point is uh here's what my point is uh here's what I'm gonna say uh I think that I'm gonna say uh I think that
[199:23.98]Joel should lose because that was a real stinker.
[199:27.97]And I think Virgin Chairlines is going upwards.
[199:31.62]It's a business strategy ahead.
[199:33.92]Whereas I think that a bucket of filth is representative of the quality.
[199:39.35]But I'll tell you what,
[199:41.64]Maybe Joey or whoever maybe read the rules.
[199:44.94]He might have had like a two-hour game.
[199:47.84]In fact, Jeremy, I'm going to send you a preview of something.
[199:50.83]Not that I would know anything about that.
[199:52.65]But I want you to check your Discord real quick because he was actually cooking up his own game before the stream or something like that.
[199:58.70]I want you to just look at this.
[200:00.04]And clearly he doesn't have time for it.
[200:01.54]But maybe someday, right?
[200:03.29]Yeah.
[200:03.93]Throw it to me in Discord.
[200:05.41]And when we get through these tours, maybe I'll take a look at it.
[200:09.63]it's just a png anyway because it sucks uh but ladies and gentlemen I want to congratulate doug doug and my main man of course uh myself so um you know is there anybody else that you would like to thank as well just putting that one out there
[200:25.06]It was fucking amazing.
[200:26.44]That was absolutely hilarious.
[200:29.34]That was genuinely one of the funniest fucking things I've seen.
[200:32.64]So, wonderful, wonderful job.
[200:34.13]Plane, Virgin Chairlines, moving on.
[200:37.15]Alright, speaking of moving on, thank you both of you.
[200:39.85]Joel, excellent.
[200:40.81]Thank you, Joel.
[200:42.14]Joel, wonderful, wonderful work.
[200:43.58]Everybody, Joel's an absolute trooper.
[200:46.96]I love Joel, man.
[200:47.98]He's fucking hilarious.
[200:48.94]He's absolutely fucking hysterical.
[200:51.61]And what a great collab that was.
[200:54.29]Alright.
[200:54.99]So we need to move on.
[200:55.89]Thank you, Doug, Doug, and Pointgrove.
[200:57.51]I'm assuming you're going to be moving on to the next round.
[200:59.56]We'll get there pretty soon.
[201:01.00]We've got two more to go through.
[201:02.86]Thank you, President.
[201:03.90]We've got next.
[201:05.00]Anybody want to go?
[201:05.84]We want to get somebody out?
[201:07.61]Somebody in?
[201:08.25]Yeah, we can go.
[201:12.25]Sounds good.
[201:12.79]I want to toss me the... I sent you the code, I think.
[201:17.26]I think someone needs to back out, though.
[201:20.36]I could back out if you guys want to do first.
[201:23.75]Sure, sure.
[201:24.33]Why not?
[201:26.38]Joel.
[201:27.76]Okay, I'm gonna be coming in here in a second.
[201:31.66]That last one was fucking crazy.
[201:33.13]I might like both body hurts.
[201:35.41]Yeah, I don't know.
[201:37.09]I'm so normal.
[201:38.07]I don't know about you guys, mouse and Connor, but mine is so fucking normal.
[201:42.60]No, that's not a that's not bad.
[201:44.14]That's not a bad thing.
[201:44.84]Don't worry about that.
[201:46.36]I mean, I mean, look, there's been a lot of shit pools.
[201:48.64]There's been a lot of coil dumps.
[201:51.37]I mean, there's been a there's been a variety.
[201:54.34]Yeah, we'll see.
[201:54.96]I spent, like, the first 20 minutes learning how to play the game.
[201:57.24]That's very true as well.
[201:59.15]Try our best.
[201:59.71]Alright, I am joining the game.
[202:03.61]I hope we did.
[202:04.11]I hope we did try our best.

[203:03.21]Oh, wow.
[203:03.63]Okay, very cool.
[203:04.18]What you're looking at here is two choices.
[203:07.22]Yes.
[203:08.10]Heaven or hell.
[203:09.78]Oh, alright.
[203:11.69]We went for an overall theme.
[203:15.39]You know, turmoil of the heart and mind.
[203:18.15]Okay.
[203:18.85]Is somebody sharing screens?
[203:21.28]Oh, no.
[203:21.76]Do you want me to do that?
[203:22.48]I can do that.
[203:23.58]Okay, I can do that.
[203:24.10]Hold on.
[203:24.66]Let me share screen real quick.
[203:25.62]Let me share screen.
[203:28.06]Okay.
[203:28.30]Alright.
[203:30.59]Is that okay for you guys?
[203:33.01]We good to go?
[203:34.27]Yep.
[203:35.34]Alright.
[203:35.58]Let's move.
[203:35.84]What you're looking at is heaven or hell.
[203:38.92]You can choose your path.
[203:40.18]Obviously, you can see that the heaven is much nicer.
[203:44.73]The lawn is kept.
[203:46.43]There's flowers, nice trees on the hell side.
[203:49.78]The lawn is all gross and not kept.
[203:52.30]We've got mounds.
[203:53.86]No, no.
[203:54.48]Wait.
[203:54.82]You don't have to say it's gross.
[203:57.63]And then you're probably wondering what is the series of croissants?
[204:01.75]What is this?
[204:02.19]Yeah.
[204:03.76]Well, so I, you know, obviously in this tour, I want to give you the choice to pick, but if by any chance there were any French people who did come in, I want to make it clear where they should go.
[204:14.23]Oh, so this is, this is a, I see.
[204:16.43]Okay.
[204:16.75]Well, anybody that's French here, I didn't, I didn't say anything to make sure that they go down this path.
[204:21.55]And then you'll notice as well, if you come and have a little walk,
[204:25.66]You might notice a bit of discomfort when you reach this part.
[204:28.51]Okay.
[204:28.81]You might think this is a mistake.
[204:30.05]No, this is just a welcoming from hell.
[204:33.04]Oh, so you like hit your head on the door.
[204:35.48]I got you.
[204:35.94]I got you.
[204:36.34]Exactly.
[204:36.76]Life is a journey.
[204:37.61]Sometimes you have to trip, you know?
[204:39.15]Okay.
[204:40.45]But yeah, please go in.
[204:42.60]Should I pick which door I would like to go through?
[204:44.84]Yeah, which one would you like to go in?
[204:45.93]Because that'll depend on who will give you the tour of each side.
[204:48.31]Because Mouse will give you the, will explain the heaven side, and I'll explain the hell side.
[204:51.77]Okay, so, but if I go through this left side first, will I be able to go through the right side after?
[204:58.00]Yeah, of course, of course, yeah.
[204:59.26]Let's go through the left side.
[205:01.47]Okay, okay, welcome to hell.
[205:03.39]Okay.
[205:04.77]It's a nice big door.
[205:07.50]Ooh, there is another door.
[205:09.99]yeah about that it's a big store whoa alright this is alright well okay welcome welcome to this this is this is the hell portion of the tour now you will notice that one thing that we've done is you know and I saw some of the other houses that they hadn't fully decorated uh there was no structural beams even though we are hell we do we are up to hoa code of course
[205:35.37]um write that one the house is supported I mean we're not monsters for sake we're not alma right yeah I uh allegedly I don't even say that yeah um so I I there is a lot of chairs here on the left side you'll see right so you can kind of I suppose you can kind of
[205:55.82]Sit and mull about your decision.
[205:57.74]Okay before you go to the final final ascent It's all about a message.
[206:02.79]It means there's many decisions.
[206:04.77]Which one are you going to take today?
[206:07.28]Okay, so does it?
[206:08.22]Okay, I get it contemplation Yeah, because you're still on you still aren't done with your decision by the way There is another decision you will need to make at some point a very big decision.
[206:20.19]Okay, but that's okay I'm so this is the bed here bedroom.
[206:22.36]I like the stove.
[206:23.10]I
[206:23.83]yes yeah I don't know why is there six stoves mouse um because of the heat the heat of your decisions you know hell is very hot I wanted a very nice warm house okay what what's wrong with you these are these are alright so no I hate no hvac system but multiple ovens to heat the house yeah okay okay sorry can I just talk were we planning to open the oven is that the plan that we were thinking like how
[206:53.38]I feel like the collective power of all the ovens will generate enough heat for the whole house.
[206:59.63]Right, and also the top, it's an IH, it's not a gas, by the way, that doesn't work with, it doesn't matter.
[207:04.24]Anyway, so we have, again, you can see perfectly split down the middle.
[207:10.21]Every single aspect of this house has been catered, including the roof, by the way.
[207:17.08]I saw it.
[207:17.98]Don't sleep on the roof.
[207:20.28]Lord knows that took a long time to do.
[207:21.99]Okay, so where should I go up?
[207:25.05]Should we go around?
[207:26.25]Go up the stairs?
[207:26.83]Should I pick one of these sides first?
[207:27.81]Well, maybe Mouse can tell you a little about the heaven side before you make the big decision.
[207:30.60]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[207:31.52]Well, just like in hell, there's many decisions you have to make in heaven as well.
[207:36.22]So that's why we have a lot of chairs.
[207:37.75]And we have our council of angels here to judge your every step.
[207:41.17]Ooh, okay.
[207:43.13]You see?
[207:43.51]You have to kiss each one on the forehead before you move.
[207:46.65]Oh, okay.
[207:47.68]Take a nap.
[207:48.96]If you want to sleep in the bed.
[207:50.04]That's very important.
[207:51.86]You have to kiss every single one.
[207:53.60]I'm doing it, I think.
[207:56.65]Perfect, perfect.
[207:59.67]Just watching your head go through the floor.
[208:05.10]Okay.
[208:05.80]Oh, wait, I forgot one.
[208:07.60]Now your whole path is illuminated and you can rest for the rest of the day.
[208:12.43]People saying you have to make kissy sounds.
[208:13.89]I'm not making a kissy sound.
[208:19.84]Please come up the stairs.
[208:21.52]This is the final decision.
[208:22.88]But I think this is the most important decision.
[208:25.67]But hold on.
[208:26.71]What about out here?
[208:27.65]This is beautiful.
[208:29.23]This is a beautiful... Oh, yes.
[208:30.87]Welcome to heaven.
[208:35.70]I have a little bit of a question, though.
[208:38.04]Is it heaven, though?
[208:39.79]I don't know.
[208:40.27]Is it heaven?
[208:41.91]Maybe it's not.
[208:42.53]Maybe it is.
[208:44.33]With all these flowers, if you have allergies, this is truly hell.
[208:48.12]Oh, that's right.
[208:48.92]But I love sunflowers, though.
[208:50.18]So this is heaven for me.
[208:51.96]Are you?
[208:52.70]Wonderful.
[208:53.47]Yes.
[208:54.31]Oh, we also added a jewel spire.
[208:56.13]I don't know if you saw that.
[208:56.93]I did.
[208:58.15]I like it.
[208:59.32]Nice touch.
[209:00.72]It's so that if God wants to pick it up and throw it the fuck away whenever he pleases, he can do that at any time.
[209:05.80]I like the two computers, but is this kind of like an odd couple scenario where you could both be playing and hanging out, but one of you is more on the dark side?
[209:14.75]I guess, yeah.
[209:15.35]One runs Stardew Valley exclusively, and the other has the Riot Games client downloaded.
[209:19.97]But also, if you want to use the computer, you need to lay down on your tummy, and you need to just prostrate yourself because, you know, the internet is God.
[209:28.88]Very true.
[209:29.62]Okay.
[209:30.33]Alright.
[209:31.03]The beams will also collapse if you move the PC, so please do not touch it.
[209:35.25]True.
[209:36.51]Alright, so what do we got up here?
[209:38.54]The most important decision of your life.
[209:40.62]Of my life.
[209:41.70]Got it?
[209:42.12]Yes.
[209:43.78]Heaven or hell, which one do you choose?
[209:47.36]Easiest choice of my life.
[209:50.79]Temperance, chastity, charity, diligence.
[209:58.37]What are the other virtues?
[210:02.58]Constitution, fortitude.
[210:04.76]I'm picking heaven.
[210:05.83]Constipation, yes.
[210:09.29]I've picked.
[210:10.71]Oh.
[210:11.97]No, no.
[210:12.87]Wait, no.
[210:13.73]What happened?
[210:15.94]You thought your choice led you to heaven.
[210:17.64]It didn't.
[210:18.36]It led you straight to hell, buddy.
[210:20.36]Why?
[210:21.16]But I picked heaven.
[210:21.92]You tried to take what wasn't yours.
[210:23.53]It's like Indiana Jones.
[210:24.71]You chose the wrong cup.
[210:30.76]Okay.
[210:31.20]Also, the TV, by the way, is only for paying customers.
[210:33.68]Oh, okay.
[210:34.90]Yeah.
[210:36.24]If, you know, obviously you'd chosen hell, you'd recognized all the sins that you've made, you know, you would have been rewarded with heaven.
[210:43.55]But if you want to dip your toes in the shared bath, heaven and hell often become one.
[210:49.70]Why not just have a little soak and enjoy it?
[210:52.41]Yeah, bathing your sins and cleanse yourself at the same time.
[210:55.29]So I, because I didn't
[210:57.40]Because I didn't... Oh, alright.
[211:00.04]That's a good twist.
[211:01.98]Yeah, why would I get to decide if I go to heaven?
[211:06.15]Exactly.
[211:06.41]Right.
[211:07.01]I get you.
[211:07.49]I think the room should decide.
[211:09.37]That's true.
[211:10.13]Wow.
[211:10.92]You just made me think... You could say it's got a lot of philosophy.
[211:14.06]It does have a massive... The creativity, the philosophy, the structural integrity.
[211:17.20]Structural integrity.
[211:19.61]There's more beams, too.
[211:20.57]I mean, beams for days.
[211:23.11]Well, that was awesome.
[211:24.87]Anything else in the yard or is that it for this one?
[211:27.00]That was a beautiful journey.
[211:29.74]That's about it.
[211:30.62]I wish I had some plane noises and a subway.
[211:33.91]I didn't have time to add that in.
[211:35.41]A crying baby.
[211:37.47]That was fucked up.
[211:38.23]I have no idea what the hell that was, but that was amazing.
[211:40.41]I wish I could compete with that.
[211:43.12]No, this is cool.
[211:44.04]What are you talking about?
[211:46.18]It's just having a howl.
[211:48.16]We're simple people.
[211:49.51]We're not extravagant.
[211:51.07]It's just having a howl.
[211:52.51]Yeah.
[211:53.29]It's clearly cut and dry.
[211:55.47]No.
[211:56.64]Everything is symmetrical, though, and I painted every single painstaking corner like a moron.
[212:01.23]I mean, it's clearly, you can tell work went into it.
[212:03.47]I think you did a good job.
[212:04.55]It's very clear that work went into it.
[212:06.82]Thank you.
[212:07.08]I appreciate that.
[212:07.70]Thank you.
[212:08.04]Thank you.
[212:08.66]It's beautiful.
[212:09.28]I hope it'll be a welcome in the new housing area.
[212:12.88]Look at those decisions.
[212:14.68]We need to have some more of that, right?
[212:16.72]Are those like really tall pillars or are they chimneys extending into the sky?
[212:20.95]Spires.
[212:21.49]Spires.
[212:24.23]Spires.
[212:24.65]Oh, okay.
[212:25.08]I like your spires.
[212:26.34]They're very cool.
[212:27.28]Thank you.
[212:27.70]Thank you.
[212:28.36]I was noticing a severe lack of spires on your guys' place.
[212:32.37]Yeah.
[212:33.09]Spires are important.
[212:33.91]She knows all about that.
[212:36.32]Alright, I'm noticing the yard here.
[212:37.42]I'm over here.
[212:38.28]Do we need, um, is, uh... Oh, Snuffy did the inside, so we should probably, like, do a present, maybe.
[212:44.10]Oh, Mouse, do you want to... Apologies.
[212:46.77]Thank you, both of you.
[212:47.55]It was wonderful.
[212:48.33]Wait, wait, look!
[212:49.59]Oh, my God!
[212:50.35]You know how we were talking about how the grass wouldn't regrow?
[212:53.07]Oh, it's fixed now.
[212:54.51]Through the power of your imagination, Gemma, the grass has actually come back.
[212:58.70]Wow.
[212:58.86]That's amazing.
[212:59.94]Wow.
[213:00.08]Hold on.
[213:01.04]We got along.
[213:01.74]Connor, could you repost the code for me?
[213:04.72]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got you.
[213:06.10]Sorry.
[213:06.81]It's a Christmas miracle.
[213:11.65]This outside is vibing with me.
[213:14.14]You like it?
[213:16.54]I learned how to place things.
[213:19.06]I sent you.
[213:19.30]Just for you.
[213:20.04]A simple fair to works to job.
[213:22.53]She loves her wife and never stops.
[213:25.69]That's our house theme.
[213:26.77]Just a simple home for me and my wife.
[213:30.60]You understand, we were roommates.
[213:32.84]Okay, alright.
[213:33.60]We're roommates.
[213:35.38]But yeah, from my time playing Planet Zoo, I learned how to place rocks.
[213:39.84]Like, every exhibit in Planet Zoo, I loved placing rocks.
[213:44.29]I learned that from Zoo Tycoon.
[213:46.19]So, I really like... I was wondering where my rocks went.
[213:50.82]Yeah.
[213:52.82]I'm really sorry about that tree earlier, by the way.
[213:54.84]I got carried away.
[213:55.72]Yeah, that was messed up.
[213:58.72]I still don't know what happened.
[214:01.45]Alright, we loaded in.
[214:03.49]I think I'm loading right now.
[214:06.18]Alright, there we go.
[214:11.06]Very cool.
[214:12.52]Alright.
[214:13.43]So this is the Snuffy and Limes.
[214:15.91]This is your house?
[214:17.29]Yes.
[214:17.69]The theme of the house is learning how to place objects in the game in real time.
[214:22.50]Give an applause for that.
[214:25.10]About learning how to place objects.
[214:27.14]I'm applauding.
[214:27.81]I think it really shows heart.
[214:31.42]It's our dream home truly.
[214:33.76]It might be innocent beginnings, but maybe there's a little bit more to it than meets the eye.
[214:40.05]You can see the potential.
[214:42.40]Imagine if in a few hours' time we get to build another one and we can carry forth our knowledge and actually place more than 20 or so objects in the garden.
[214:53.55]I think it would be very exciting.
[214:55.60]Yeah, there may or may not be an opportunity for that.
[214:58.84]Do you want to present the outside, dear Laimu?
[215:02.33]Yes, so this is the outside of the house.
[215:05.05]I learned how to place ivy very late on, but I like it a lot.
[215:08.62]And then I also liked the mushrooms that I found in the item builder.
[215:12.95]Those are pretty nice.
[215:14.09]I also liked placing tree stumps.
[215:16.50]I thought those were very aesthetic.
[215:18.68]The back garden is...
[215:20.76]left natural I forgot that that was actually a component so it's all around the front and I'm very pleased with what we managed I love the logs I love the log placement this is this is really this is really beautiful I love the log placement I'm very I'm very glad I actually I had to learn how to turn gravity off because when I initially planted the log it started spinning and kind of flipped up into the sky for a second but then eventually I managed to get it to like balance on this rock which made me
[215:47.92]Are you sure you bought like a real log and not some sort of like a black market alien log?
[215:53.26]I don't think things can fly away in this game.
[215:55.93]Gravity is really complicated.
[215:57.09]Oh, and this side, I actually had time to plant some bushes.
[215:59.15]I forgot I did that, but that's nice.
[216:01.88]Oh, yeah.
[216:02.98]There's some complexity back here.
[216:05.38]Yeah, yeah.
[216:06.36]I placed some stuff.
[216:07.24]And then Snuffy kept begging me to go inside and help her with actually decorating the house.
[216:11.27]But I think I spent most of my time placing rocks.
[216:14.61]I hope you like the rocks.
[216:16.16]This is fantastic.
[216:17.46]I think, you know, we really went for like a rustic, like, critter core cottage.
[216:22.77]It's just a beautiful place for ferret and raccoon wives to live together and game together.
[216:30.30]I love it.
[216:33.11]Alright, come on in.
[216:34.35]Come on in to our humble critter abode.
[216:37.57]Okay.
[216:38.66]Yes.
[216:39.12]So, you know, it's honestly surprisingly simple and you might be shocked.
[216:43.81]You might be shocked, but you know, it's our dream home.
[216:46.61]Truly a place to kick back and relax.
[216:48.47]It's got everything any home would ever want.
[216:51.21]I did a lot of colors.
[216:52.86]It's got a lot of open space on the floor.
[216:54.54]Oh, look at the hanging thing.
[216:56.22]Somebody can hang out up here.
[216:57.52]Yeah, isn't it cute?
[216:59.30]I thought it would be cute to hang these little pillars and really make it kind of natural.
[217:03.15]So this is kind of like the cute little chill in case you want to read a book or something up there.
[217:06.80]Okay.
[217:07.14]Do you have laundry here?
[217:07.98]You've got the laundry basket.
[217:09.38]Oh, I thought that was like a cat carrier.
[217:12.44]Oh, it does look like a cat carrier.
[217:14.83]That's where I'll put you when you're bad.
[217:18.74]Now, you know, we also have, I almost forgot to ask you to take your shoes off at the door.
[217:23.78]You know, you can put your coat up, put your hat away.
[217:26.61]Very cute.
[217:28.09]Okay.
[217:28.51]I'm a raccoon, so those are my slippers.
[217:31.51]Oh, look at that.
[217:34.68]Would you just look at that?
[217:35.56]It's the little things that make a house a home, you know?
[217:39.20]True.
[217:41.28]Alright.
[217:41.64]This is our chilling couch.
[217:43.45]Just pretty simple.
[217:44.57]We're gamers.
[217:46.33]We like what we like.
[217:47.99]This is just our home goods.
[217:49.41]I got my AirPods before I go out on my run over here.
[217:52.11]We've got some fairly heirlooms.
[217:55.92]You know, we're freshly moved in types, so.
[217:58.64]Yeah, I like the, there's the little, the cute stuff on the shelf.
[218:02.57]You got the postcard, you got the vacuum.
[218:05.03]I see, you're ready.
[218:06.05]You're ready to start the journey.
[218:08.64]I really want to impress you with this one now may I present to you this room here a fully furnished bathroom simple eloquent can I just say very nice can I just say this is the most beautiful bathroom of the day thank you so much
[218:34.78]This is clean.
[218:36.28]It's thawed out.
[218:37.42]It ain't just a toilet with the trash on it.
[218:43.93]Ludwig and Squeaks' bathroom was really good too.
[218:47.33]There was a lot.
[218:48.03]There was so much creativity here.
[218:49.67]And I do think, you know, like a dream house can be many things to many different people, but I just, I don't know.
[218:56.14]Bathrooms are a safe place.
[218:57.52]I just wanted like, you know, when you open that door and you walk in and you're just like,
[219:02.01]that's what I wanted to kind of if I walked in here if I walked in here I actually would be excited the world's most exciting piss well that comes from the next room okay oh let me get the ceiling I love it it's a great bathroom okay thank you this is the bedroom okay
[219:25.89]It's pretty simple again.
[219:26.79]I can only supply what you would over need.
[219:29.50]You know, here's a little game and set up.
[219:31.54]This is the bed for me and Limu.
[219:33.82]It's got everything you need.
[219:34.74]I like the tissues.
[219:36.01]Yeah.
[219:36.55]I see a carton of eggs.
[219:39.15]Yeah.
[219:40.29]What's going on with the eggs?
[219:42.48]I mean, have you ever gotten peg-ish?
[219:45.26]The bags?
[219:46.44]Hard-boiled bag?
[219:47.46]This belongs to a raccoon and a ferret.
[219:49.73]Like, you know, eggs are delicious.
[219:52.27]Yeah, and here's a spoon when you crack it open and eat it too.
[219:55.23]Look at this little table.
[220:03.38]Yeah, I was just thinking about limes the whole time.
[220:05.77]So basically everything is just pink and green and stuff.
[220:08.85]And there's very few blue things.
[220:09.81]Everything's really small.
[220:11.07]Like the table is so low down.
[220:12.70]It's so sweet of you.
[220:15.98]Okay, very nice.
[220:17.82]This is the kitchen.
[220:20.40]Oh my gosh, I think I messed up here, and there might be two fridges placed, because I thought I deleted it, but maybe it was just invisible, because here it's showing the doors open, but they're closed, so there might actually be two fridges.
[220:29.57]Two fridges, huh?
[220:30.17]It's probably the same thing as the grass.
[220:33.07]Yeah.
[220:33.57]Spontaneously manifested.
[220:34.37]I'm mad, because I put something in the fridge.
[220:36.23]There is something in there.
[220:38.35]Can you maybe open it again?
[220:39.56]Oh, there it is.
[220:41.40]It's a feature, double doors.
[220:44.24]You somehow have two fridges inside of each other.
[220:47.53]Hold on.
[220:48.09]Maybe you can, like, shove your head inside the fridge and see what's in there.
[220:50.78]It's got a pie.
[220:51.62]You've got a pie.
[220:52.67]It's pie and jam with some milk to wash it down.
[220:58.24]Not that I thought out every little detail.
[221:00.79]Oh my goodness.
[221:02.76]Make a house a home, Snuffy.
[221:04.14]Make a house a home.
[221:05.48]Can I just say that this knife board here is actually a cork board.
[221:11.81]And I floated that on there.
[221:15.07]I know.
[221:15.57]Kind of ingenious.
[221:18.13]Alright.
[221:19.61]That's a really nice touch.
[221:21.58]I love the cork board.
[221:22.84]I love the pie.
[221:23.78]My favorite is this banana cream by any chance?
[221:28.62]Ooh, I'm afraid this is what's ever in season.
[221:31.95]Oh, summer fruit.
[221:33.89]It's wild berries.
[221:36.13]From our garden.
[221:36.59]How would this be banana cream?
[221:37.35]This is like apple and cranberries.
[221:39.58]Why am I a grandma?
[221:43.64]Look, I like grandma shit, okay?
[221:46.02]That's just the way it is.
[221:46.90]The cottagecore house immediately transformed him as soon as he came in front of the door.
[221:50.35]Let me take a look at the outside again.
[221:51.35]Okay.
[221:56.72]Shit.
[221:57.08]Shit.
[222:01.12]If you put a bedroom in here, I'd live in this bathroom.
[222:06.61]It's got everything, too.
[222:07.83]You know, we've got a ventilation system.
[222:09.33]It won't even get too stinky.
[222:11.55]We've got towels, a little window up there for privacy because it'd be weird if anybody had a window that wasn't, you know, fought out to, like, dig height or something.
[222:20.68]Okay, this is going to be tricky because here's the issue.
[222:25.85]I'm going to get a good look at both of them.
[222:27.09]This is...
[222:29.03]This one on the right here, the creativity with that.
[222:31.98]The split house, the decision at the end.
[222:34.68]I love, let me look at the yard again.
[222:36.33]I love the double concept.
[222:41.13]I love the trail of sunflowers.
[222:43.84]I love the...
[222:45.88]The poops, they're not shits.
[222:48.68]I know they're not, but that's been burned in my mind.
[222:50.70]Remember, we're not just giving you a home.
[222:52.87]We're giving you an experience.
[222:54.99]Yeah, that's very true.
[222:57.82]This one is so cute.
[222:59.72]It's so, it's like if I was in the neighborhood, I would pop over and get some sugar from, you know, like, can I get a bowl of sugar or can I get some, do you have any tea I can take from you?
[223:12.15]I can lend you a bottle of water.
[223:14.69]We get to stay for the HOA approval, but if we don't stay on the block, everybody who lives here has immense creativity.
[223:21.80]The No Masi and Connor's house is so impressive.
[223:25.10]Your house is so cute.
[223:26.77]I'm gonna scream.
[223:27.57]Your house is literally so cool.
[223:28.83]You guys have such an awesome theme, and you executed it brilliantly.
[223:31.87]I love your house.
[223:32.77]I especially love the kissing circle for all of these little darlings.
[223:36.40]It's beautiful.
[223:37.42]It's adorable.
[223:38.38]Our little kissing angels, they need to go to your house.
[223:41.16]I left you guys free.
[223:45.46]It's time to make a decision.
[223:46.40]We've got one more to go through before we do the next build, and 12 people have been eliminated, or 12 people will be eliminated.
[223:56.14]On one side, you got the creative... I love the... The inside is so cool.
[224:01.18]I love the marbling and the... This one is just a nice, cute home with all the little details and the pie and the...
[224:10.91]oh this one is so cool though with the choice of the the chairs in the oh this is incredibly hard oh let me take one more look at this one
[224:29.96]Again, I love them both for different reasons.
[224:32.20]I love them both for very different reasons.
[224:34.39]I would live in this house.
[224:36.19]I would live in this house.
[224:37.67]But the choices that you make, the creative, the you had to pick one, but you picked a door.
[224:42.18]Oh, sorry, you don't get to choose that you get to go to heaven.
[224:44.92]What a message.
[224:45.58]That's a powerful message.
[224:48.35]And it's like, look at this, the slants here, a lot of structural work.
[225:12.22]I'm going to make my decision in 10 seconds.
[225:13.90]It actually is very hard.
[225:18.23]Because I love them both for different reasons.
[225:20.53]I'm on the edge of my seat.
[225:31.73]Seedog and Iron Must, thank you so much for coming.
[225:35.35]But I'm going to have to pick the cottage.
[225:37.36]I'm so sorry.
[225:40.52]It was so cool.
[225:42.55]Your house was so good.
[225:43.93]Your house was so beautiful.
[225:45.71]I need Elmo's number now.
[225:46.98]It was so awesome.
[225:50.60]This section here is just like, I love it.
[225:53.27]I love the entrance.
[225:56.55]I love this.
[225:58.18]Is it because you couldn't go to heaven, Gemma?
[225:59.75]Is that why?
[226:00.05]Is it because you couldn't go to heaven?
[226:03.85]You know what?
[226:04.29]Because I was far from heaven.
[226:06.13]I was far from heaven.
[226:09.13]You did a fantastic job, though.
[226:12.72]Absolutely wonderful.
[226:13.52]I love it.
[226:15.23]I just... You know what?
[226:18.17]Put it over the edge for me on this side.
[226:20.52]It's stuff like that.
[226:21.44]Like, this is... They're, like, placing all the logs.
[226:24.96]A couple of rocks?
[226:26.49]No, but it's... You want some petals on the ground, Chandler?
[226:29.33]Is that what you want?
[226:31.14]I need your petals.
[226:33.08]It's just Rocks outside you didn't put rocks on it.
[226:46.88]Oh, I didn't pedal simulator house simulator.
[226:51.79]Oh
[226:53.92]Oh, great, I'll just go to the local fucking quarry next time and I'll fucking throw some rocks on the ground.
[226:59.35]You should have mined some rocks by hand and put them outside.
[227:03.49]This HOA is a fucking disaster.
[227:05.05]This is such an awesome house.
[227:08.10]Honestly, the reason why this is so hard... I'm taking it to another HOA, Jerma, okay?
[227:13.80]No, no!
[227:15.34]Maybe this room for both.
[227:17.27]I'm going to call up Elmo.
[227:18.65]I want to find out where he's going.
[227:21.15]I'm absolutely, eternally heartbroken.
[227:24.11]You guys did a fantastic job.
[227:25.55]They were both A pluses.
[227:27.22]They're both A pluses.
[227:28.30]And this whole thing is just for fun anyways.
[227:31.74]You guys did a phenomenal job.
[227:33.26]You guys are great.
[227:35.31]Lovely, lovely.
[227:36.13]And it was great to obviously to meet you, Iron Mouse.
[227:39.35]I know I've had passing kind of times I've seen you before, but thanks for participating.
[227:44.26]Wonderful to have you.
[227:45.18]No, thank you.
[227:45.92]Thank you for having me.
[227:47.25]If you guys want to stick around, by all means.
[227:50.65]If not, then feel free to dip out or whatever.
[227:53.41]But we got one more lot to do and then we can move on.
[227:59.90]Alright.
[228:00.14]Congratulations, Snuffy.
[228:01.11]Appreciate you for having me.
[228:02.65]Thank you.
[228:04.35]Thanks for having me again.
[228:05.55]Thank you.
[228:07.09]Bye.
[228:07.41]Thank you for sharing a lot with us.
[228:10.28]Bye.
[228:11.12]Alright.
[228:11.98]Miles, it was so nice playing with you.
[228:13.84]Connor.
[228:15.55]Likewise.
[228:16.23]Yes.
[228:17.18]to get that code.
[228:18.56]That's it.
[228:19.00]That's all I have for you.
[228:19.89]Alright.
[228:20.21]See you guys.
[228:20.71]Love you.
[228:21.45]Appreciate you all.
[228:22.05]Appreciate you all.
[228:22.79]Take care, guys.
[228:23.99]There are no winners and losers.
[228:25.41]You guys are all amazing.
[228:26.29]Seriously.
[228:26.67]We need someone to drop from the... Well... I can drop.
[228:31.96]You have asked him to leave the call.
[228:34.24]You just told me I could spin around.
[228:37.37]I'll just watch.
[228:39.25]Oh, great.
[228:40.08]It's like Elmo's room with the telescope.
[228:41.80]I'll just sit out the window and I'll just have a little walk, shall I?
[228:46.02]Oh, man.
[228:46.69]Oh, man.
[228:47.51]You guys are too much.
[228:48.25]I have dropped, so you guys can go first.
[228:50.21]Okay, cool.
[228:51.75]Thanks, guys.
[228:52.77]Take care.
[228:53.84]Take care.
[228:55.48]Alright, let me join that group.
[228:59.96]And this was always going to be the longest because it was the most amount of people.
[229:03.50]So we're only, the tours will go a lot longer, not longer next time, but I am joining now.
[229:11.25]Take your time.
[229:12.07]They get a chance to show their houses.
[229:13.92]Yeah, maybe do this.
[229:16.86]Sorry.
[229:17.60]Sorry.
[229:17.90]Give me one moment.
[229:22.61]Fucking Elmo's house.
[229:25.01]I still kick it over that.
[229:26.05]That's like in my mind forever now.
[229:27.51]That's like trapped in my brain forever.
[229:29.56]I can't believe you presented Elmo's Crackton on a House Flipper 2 sponsored stream.
[229:34.87]It was on the Steam page too.
[229:38.82]To be fair, he said, anything goes, their devs are cool.
[229:42.76]So this was just a challenge.
[229:47.63]It was also just a hot spoon room.
[229:50.44]I'm not trying to offend Elmo.
[229:51.90]That's true.
[229:52.58]It was a hot spoon room.
[229:53.48]Until you turn the corner into the other room, okay?
[229:56.89]There was a hot spoon room.
[229:57.99]There was another room.
[229:59.42]There was another room.
[230:01.60]An exercise room?
[230:02.62]Sorry, you can't get a little lubed up before you do some squats?
[230:06.01]Would you say that was ejaculate?
[230:10.72]Alright.
[230:11.74]Where are we going first?
[230:13.89]The lawyers are editing the contracts for the next one as we speak.
[230:18.48]Can somebody screen share, please?
[230:21.12]Oh, yeah.
[230:21.40]I got it.
[230:22.28]Thank you so much.
[230:23.14]Thank you, Cregan.
[230:25.12]Thank you, Cregan.
[230:26.43]My face hurts.
[230:27.21]I've been laughing for three or four hours.
[230:30.87]Hi.
[230:31.71]This is Elmo's attorney, and we can't help but notice that you were discussing the internals of the home outside of the home.
[230:40.16]I would urge you to reread your NDA right now.
[230:48.33]I did sign that with a fingerprint.
[230:50.30]Oh, shit.
[230:52.08]And pubic hair.
[230:53.38]Elmo can't hurt you here.
[230:54.46]Elmo can't hurt you here.
[230:56.14]We are going to take you somewhere safe.
[230:58.13]Because we're in a different realm, one might say.
[231:01.15]If you remember last year, me and Etalyx built a certain mine
[231:08.35]In Moria.
[231:09.43]Well, this may remind you of another location in the lands of Middle Earth.
[231:15.38]Why don't you take it away, RT, in that lovely Irish brogue of yours.
[231:18.99]Sure thing.
[231:20.11]Do you remember the Shire, Jerma?
[231:22.21]I do.
[231:22.42]It's been many days since you've been there.
[231:24.46]We have your very own Hobbit hole.
[231:28.63]which is for me our dream home it's for you with modern conveniences applied to it this time as well you know we've updated it we have like this nice street lighting we have a lovely little picnic bench here you have a little frog friend he's for you interesting okay very nice
[231:44.42]You know, all the animals are here.
[231:45.73]They love it.
[231:46.63]And we've made it merge with the actual, like, kind of landscape.
[231:50.23]We've kind of, like, sculpted the land here.
[231:52.65]There's, like, vegetation growing all over the top of it.
[231:55.20]We have trees kind of decorated in the garden.
[231:58.16]Just so you can really just, you know, lose yourself here and just call it home.
[232:01.97]Would you like to step inside?
[232:03.67]I would love to step inside momentarily.
[232:05.95]Let me take this in.
[232:07.39]Take your time.
[232:09.16]Please take your time.
[232:11.52]I love the outside.
[232:12.28]Take it all in.
[232:13.60]I love that.
[232:14.58]Take your time.
[232:17.23]Just take your time.
[232:18.15]Now, it is a hobbit hole.
[232:22.05]I can't.
[232:25.20]So it was really hard for us to get this to work.
[232:30.67]But you're going to have to crouch.
[232:31.91]Clouch down a little bit.
[232:33.59]You're going to have to crouch a little.
[232:34.87]This is for hobbits.
[232:36.53]Okay.
[232:37.46]Oh, my God.
[232:38.36]This is for hobbits.
[232:40.87]Now, we're not implying this is a home for you by any means.
[232:43.73]We're just simply this is, you know, a size appropriate for Hobbits.
[232:47.22]Yeah, it's for Hobbits.
[232:48.36]You'll see them actually all around if you look carefully.
[232:50.48]You might see them scampering around, a couple of presents in hand, maybe making something in the kitchen over there.
[232:59.07]This is insane.
[233:00.07]I can't imagine how hard this was to actually to do that.
[233:05.00]Oh, it was really hard.
[233:06.88]It really took us a while to get this right.
[233:11.87]How did you even attempt to do this?
[233:18.54]Well, what if small, I think was just kind of the thought when we first loaded in.
[233:23.31]And from there, we just kind of built a miniature.
[233:28.35]We had to put the roof on last because we couldn't fit in the home for a substantial amount of time.
[233:33.14]So we had to stand up awkwardly out of it.
[233:35.72]We also had to figure out how to shrink the door into the ground.
[233:38.75]That was really hard.
[233:39.97]Modern bathroom here because you know as much as we love the rustic feel of Lord of the Rings I don't think we all want to shit in the hole True, so you'll see here.
[233:47.54]We have upgraded the amenities here a little bit We still have a lovely window, but you'll notice privacy is a main concern and so Yeah, we sculpted the land around us.
[233:58.61]That's right.
[233:59.07]You don't have to worry about someone watching your shit You're saying that is you good thinking good thinking excellent work Okay, wait here.
[234:07.08]I love the I love the bath I
[234:09.13]In case you're wondering, hey, why is there a Christmas tree planted in the middle of the room?
[234:12.95]Why is there a Christmas tree?
[234:14.95]Well, because the Lord of the Rings actually remind me of Christmas.
[234:17.55]And there's a time when you kind of have a lot of time around the house and that you would family and you just want to watch like old nostalgic movies.
[234:23.58]Sure.
[234:25.08]It's just associate the time with that, which is a personal choice by one of the decorators.
[234:29.75]And, you know, I think it's nice to note that we left all of ourselves in this build.
[234:33.63]You know, this wasn't just a quick, you know, money grab.
[234:37.26]We're out here leaving ourselves in this.
[234:39.74]What would you look?
[234:40.38]Oh, little chessboard.
[234:41.62]Oh, wow.
[234:44.36]My heart is- We tried to make it so cozy we have the fire, and if you look closely at the fire, what is- what is that ring that must be cast into the flames?
[234:54.05]That's a little big.
[234:55.48]That's a little big.
[234:56.58]That's a little big.
[234:58.69]Well, it actually shrinks to the size of the wearer, which is actually canonically true in the movies.
[235:04.74]It is, but also, interestingly enough, the actual ring prop that they use for a lot of close-ups of the shot, in particular around the fireplace, was an actual much larger ring.
[235:13.27]That's how they get the detail on it.
[235:15.07]That's actually in the behind-the-scenes for Lord of the Rings.
[235:16.89]So, I appreciate your concern, but fuck you.
[235:18.23]That's actually... Hey, you got me.
[235:21.68]That is a total correction.
[235:22.66]I'll take it.
[235:24.19]We have a beautiful little adventurer's bedroom here, complete with some greenery.
[235:31.30]We have an adventurer's chest, maybe for some goods you'll find on your journeys.
[235:37.44]This is where Bilbo can store his mithril vest.
[235:41.16]Mithril.
[235:43.09]Okay, love it.
[235:44.74]And we have a study over here to maybe pen a book of your adventures in the lands.
[235:51.73]Okay.
[235:52.57]We did give you a laptop if you want to write it this time, you know?
[235:55.50]Yeah, yeah.
[235:55.84]Pen and paper might take a while, but just for modern conveniences, you know, use like Office Word or some shit.
[236:00.88]Save yourself a bit of hassle.
[236:02.65]And then, what do hobbits love, Jerma?
[236:06.05]Tea!
[236:07.69]Yeah, I'll take it.
[236:08.69]Alright.
[236:08.97]Tea and food.
[236:10.25]That's right.
[236:11.47]Look at this kitchen.
[236:12.64]Oh, my God.
[236:13.56]It's the Proudfoots.
[236:15.14]They're here for a dinner.
[236:16.30]Oh, and they're welcoming us into their home.
[236:18.06]Thank you so much.
[236:22.43]Proudfeet?
[236:22.65]What the fuck?
[236:23.25]Yeah, Proudfeet.
[236:24.11]It's the Proudfoots.
[236:25.17]No, that's an actual Hobbit family.
[236:26.97]Is that an actual family?
[236:28.93]Yes, it is.
[236:29.97]It is.
[236:30.37]It's in the books.
[236:31.40]Oh, my God.
[236:32.22]Every detail has been thought of.
[236:36.01]Yeah, look at this.
[236:36.77]I mean, all the well-stocked pantry.
[236:40.65]Oh, my God.
[236:41.33]Look at all this food.
[236:44.06]This is the pantry.
[236:45.40]Where am I going to go?
[236:46.26]What if I want to sit outside and I want to enjoy a coffee and look at the yard?
[236:50.34]Well, you go through this appropriately sized little hole, this little doorway.
[236:54.13]This is a little small.
[236:55.89]This one's a little tight.
[236:57.57]I think even the Hobbit might have to crouch on this one.
[237:01.18]Yeah, but now look and it would be fit for a dog.
[237:04.57]Give it a single cookie.
[237:06.37]And here's your cup of tea, Jerma.
[237:08.62]Yeah.
[237:09.56]I love the tea.
[237:10.22]Look out over your yard.
[237:12.40]Wow.
[237:13.23]It is like a... Wow.
[237:16.55]You mean that?
[237:18.13]Look at this.
[237:18.63]Look at the rock in the backyard.
[237:21.20]Look.
[237:23.22]If we may draw your attention as well, just to the roof of the place, we actually kind of made it blend with vegetation and that, so it looks appropriately covered, because you have a lot of plants in that over Hobbit homes.
[237:33.44]We wanted to blend it with the landscape as much as we could.
[237:36.53]I gotta tell you.
[237:38.85]Stunning.
[237:40.43]Stunning.
[237:42.07]This is beautiful stuff, guys.
[237:43.67]I'm blown away.
[237:44.31]It's really impressive.
[237:45.90]This is unbelievable.
[237:46.52]Very cozy.
[237:47.38]I cannot believe, first of all, that you went through the painful process in one hour to do this.
[237:54.73]That's unbelievable.
[237:57.07]I love the dinner.
[237:58.61]It's just the, oh, crack the pots and smash the plates, because that's what Bilbo Baggins hates.
[238:04.14]I remember that part, and that just brought me there.
[238:07.22]Yeah.
[238:07.30]Great rendition.
[238:08.84]Great rendition, Mr. President.
[238:09.82]That was great.
[238:14.01]Yeah.
[238:14.13]Alright.
[238:14.37]It's phenomenal.
[238:14.95]It's wonderful.
[238:15.43]I give... I mean, obviously, all these have been so fucking good.
[238:18.59]I love them all.
[238:20.60]This is so... I love this.
[238:21.78]You guys... Everybody doing this is so fucking cool.
[238:25.34]You guys are amazing.
[238:27.02]Alright.
[238:27.46]Let's do the next one.
[238:28.33]If there's anything else for me to see, this is unbelievable, guys.
[238:31.35]Unbelievable.
[238:31.81]That's about it.
[238:32.29]Thank you so much.
[238:33.71]Thank you very much.
[238:35.53]I'm going to grab the code and rejoin here if one of you wants to drop.
[238:40.62]Yeah, do you want me to drop out?
[238:43.47]Yeah, I'm the host, so yeah.
[238:45.05]Okay, just give me one second and I'll just get this disconnect.
[238:50.66]I thought I saw a bunch of shit on the walls.
[238:52.67]I thought I saw like smeared shit on the walls and I was like, is this another shithouse?
[238:57.69]Is there poop in this one?
[238:58.99]Let me rejoin.
[239:00.21]What, in ours?
[239:01.39]No, no, no.
[239:02.36]No, sir.
[239:03.14]No.
[239:04.76]I'm just going to mute on my end.
[239:06.74]I'll just watch the stream from here.
[239:08.41]Oh, cool.
[239:11.11]I'll be back.
[239:11.59]I think we're loading right now.
[239:22.87]These are great.
[239:24.27]I just want to get started here.
[239:26.57]Mr. President, how are you doing today?
[239:30.20]How's your day been so far?
[239:31.40]It's been fantastic.
[239:32.96]I had some thoughts about what this was going to look like for this first round, and I've been blown away so far, completely.
[239:43.39]Absolutely, completely blown away.
[239:45.55]I have to agree I really think that people have brought creativity they brought spit and polish that brought a lot of shine yeah and really spruced up things in the neighborhood um in a way that I didn't think was even possible now I would first of all welcome to our lovely home thank you for the invite
[240:06.30]My name is Stu.
[240:08.79]My partner, Sark, here.
[240:10.35]That's me.
[240:12.13]Yeah, right here.
[240:13.16]He's right here.
[240:14.52]We heard what you said about curb appeal and really bringing the look of the HOA back to its roots, if you will.
[240:24.36]True.
[240:24.92]Sure.
[240:25.18]And so we wanted to present to you the most in-line, structurally sound, custom, but within the lines, home.
[240:38.46]And cheap to manufacture.
[240:40.24]Very cheap to manufacture.
[240:41.82]Yes, and cheap to manufacture.
[240:43.32]But structurally sound.
[240:44.38]Now, first of all, if you could get your ruler out, which I know you always have with you.
[240:48.19]I know you always have with you, Mr. President.
[240:49.95]And just check the grass height here.
[240:52.05]The grass site is within specifications.
[240:54.56]It's been very specially mowed.
[240:57.36]It does seem mowed, which I appreciate.
[240:59.43]Yes, yes.
[241:00.19]And these flowers here.
[241:02.09]And I'm happy to take you to the backyard here across the driveway.
[241:07.02]Yeah.
[241:07.40]Check that out first.
[241:08.02]Would love to.
[241:08.42]Nice driveway.
[241:09.91]Thank you, thank you.
[241:10.71]Yeah, you could probably fit two cars in here comfortably up to four or five if you're having guests, which wonderful space back here.
[241:19.52]Speaking of guests, to throw a barbecue, you can have a little fire pit.
[241:24.50]A full game of soccer or football or our European friends.
[241:28.99]Maybe cricket, if that's more your speed.
[241:31.61]Hang out in the shade of the oak tree, which has been here for, and we've got this checked, 150 years.
[241:38.14]That's a lot of years.
[241:39.25]150-year-old oak tree.
[241:40.65]So there's a lot of history in this space.
[241:42.83]Refinement alongside history.
[241:46.22]Uh-huh.
[241:46.62]I'd love the picnic table back here.
[241:48.90]Yeah, you know, you can put anything you want there.
[241:50.80]You can play a game out there, have a little drink, maybe have some food with a cookout.
[241:54.79]Just one, though.
[241:57.16]Well, yeah, I mean, this is for a single family, kind of a normal, what you'd expect to see in a regular household.
[242:05.55]Okay, gotcha.
[242:07.13]Yeah.
[242:07.30]Perfect.
[242:08.92]Not just very normal family.
[242:12.12]Not too many guests.
[242:13.96]No, no, no.
[242:16.59]One or two kids.
[242:18.57]What you kind of, when you're growing up, you know what some people expect?
[242:21.51]Not everyone.
[242:22.01]We all have our own experience.
[242:23.33]What they expect to have when they're older.
[242:25.63]Okay.
[242:25.99]Please come on inside.
[242:28.32]Wow.
[242:28.88]Now, the first thing I'd like to point out here is go ahead and press right here.

[243:02.22]I would love a drink from the fridge.
[243:04.02]Yeah, here.
[243:05.37]Whatever you'd like.
[243:06.47]I know you said you like to relax a little bit after work.
[243:09.54]I know it's been a long day.
[243:11.43]It's been a long day.
[243:12.87]Mm-hmm.
[243:13.50]Maybe you can have a drink and start to relax.
[243:14.82]We remembered that you said you liked throwing back a cold one every now and then.
[243:18.92]Fruity beverages.
[243:20.03]Those are all fruity drinks.
[243:21.77]Low, low ABV.
[243:23.43]I know you don't like getting too crazy.
[243:25.53]No, no.
[243:26.47]I very much enjoy that.
[243:27.68]Let me take a look at this.
[243:28.40]Cool guy, though.
[243:29.34]Beautiful.
[243:29.92]I am a cool HOA president.
[243:31.84]I'm a cool HOA president.
[243:33.18]Got our spices, our pantry there.
[243:34.81]And also, we do have a snack over here, if I may.
[243:38.17]We've got some cheese and bread for you, if you'd like a little snack.
[243:40.85]Very fresh.
[243:43.62]Yeah, that is the dishwasher.
[243:45.92]Thank you, Kryken, for showing that off.
[243:47.97]Okay, beautiful.
[243:48.81]Yeah, I have to mention it.
[243:49.51]Beautiful.
[243:50.07]Yeah, yeah, now... You're doing it.
[243:52.25]It is completely, completely properly furnished.
[243:55.48]TV, game station, comfortable furniture.
[243:59.16]Hardwood flooring, now it is.
[244:01.01]It's not real wood.
[244:02.65]It's technically vinyl, but we went with the vinyl because...
[244:05.89]It is much stronger, less likely to wear, much easier to clean.
[244:10.84]It's absolutely stunning.
[244:11.76]It's much easier to clean.
[244:13.05]Yeah.
[244:13.45]Thank you so much.
[244:14.27]Thank you so much.
[244:14.83]If I may bring you down the hall here, maybe someone who has cats or is growing a family who likes cats might like this house.
[244:24.76]And you can go right into the bathroom there.
[244:26.99]Bathroom?
[244:28.43]And if you notice on your left, on your left, you do have a light switch.
[244:32.53]No way.
[244:34.10]There you go.
[244:35.41]And guys, look, I think everyone's had a wonderful house.
[244:40.18]Okay.
[244:40.68]Everyone has had a wonderful house.
[244:42.38]One thing that I have seen lacking and it's not a mark on them.
[244:46.11]It's more just a level of our personal distinction and care for the HOA.
[244:50.78]Look what's there on the wall next to the toilet.
[244:53.58]I see paper.
[244:55.09]Toilet paper on the roll.
[244:56.35]That's all.
[244:57.31]I'm going to let that speak for itself.
[244:59.66]Stunning.
[245:00.88]If you come back here, we do have some more wall decorations.
[245:04.28]We're very worldly.
[245:05.39]We want to present a geopolitically connected view.
[245:09.13]We're very welcoming and inclusive here.
[245:10.37]Here's the whole world.
[245:12.02]The whole world.
[245:12.72]You can see the whole part of it.
[245:14.42]And you can go ahead into the master bedroom there.
[245:18.96]Oh my goodness.
[245:20.16]This is beautiful.
[245:22.67]This is actually beautiful.
[245:24.89]At the risk of repeating myself for a third time, Mr. President, if you look at the wall next to the door, I gotta say, our future and your future of the HOA is looking bright, Mr. President.
[245:38.19]It is looking bright.
[245:39.51]Oh my God.
[245:41.19]That's right.
[245:41.69]Two bathrooms.
[245:42.41]There is a master bath.
[245:43.41]I will say that is a recent addition.
[245:45.95]It's a recent addition.
[245:47.73]So it's not quite done yet, but it does have all the furnishings you need.
[245:53.08]Obviously a bed, plenty of storage space, and just a very straightforward normal house.
[246:00.59]Just a straightforward normal house.
[246:01.61]It could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship, you think?
[246:04.37]Yeah, it could be.
[246:05.63]This is gorgeous.
[246:06.33]How's that drink?
[246:07.75]How's that drink?
[246:09.34]I it tastes fruity it tastes bubbly wonderful I love I love the live laugh love live love laugh live love laugh you know uh this is excellent absolutely excellent yeah hey Sark so what did you think what did you think I thought it was beautiful I think this is absolutely stunning it's this is uh what's going on with that uh got

[246:38.78]You're cool, right?
[246:40.00]You're cool, right, Mr. President?
[246:42.33]I'm a cool president.
[246:43.83]Are you cool?
[246:44.51]You're cool?
[246:45.13]I'm cool?
[246:45.79]Yeah, of course I am.
[246:47.25]You're not a knock?
[246:49.14]I've been known to dance.
[246:50.40]I've danced a little bit at the company gathering.
[246:53.68]What kind of vibes are you picking up, Stu?
[246:56.43]I smell pig.
[246:58.68]Here, here, here, here.
[246:59.78]I know, I'm cool, I'm cool.
[247:01.00]Let's have a little chat.
[247:02.44]Okay, look.
[247:03.28]Look, he... I've known him for a long time, but not as long as I was locked up in Sing Sing.
[247:10.01]I ain't never going back, Stu.
[247:11.78]I know, I know, I know.
[247:12.68]Listen, listen, listen!
[247:14.04]Listen, we gotta get in with the HOA if we want things to fly.
[247:18.55]He says he's cool, it's on you.
[247:20.23]Mr. President, follow us.
[247:22.87]I mean, I think I'm cool.
[247:25.52]Nope, yes, you're very cool.
[247:27.02]Go ahead, go ahead.
[247:28.28]Fine.
[247:32.43]Alright, get down here.
[247:36.10]So here we have... If you tell anybody about this, I'll kill your family.
[247:41.09]He's not lying.
[247:44.72]My mom is dead.
[247:45.94]Here we have...
[247:47.62]A state-of-the-art enclosed grow room.
[247:51.94]Affordable to build, Mr. President, and also pays for itself within two weeks.
[247:58.43]Very interesting.
[248:01.67]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[248:02.22]So you can see a grow light state-of-the-art.
[248:05.56]These plants are starting out.
[248:06.70]We did just move in.
[248:08.14]But before long, you know, if you approve us, there will definitely be a piece coming off the top here once these plants grow.
[248:17.10]A little of the weed, Mr. Press?
[248:18.84]Pot?
[248:19.20]No?
[248:21.16]Dodge?
[248:21.94]Gentlemen, let me just be very clear about something.
[248:27.89]This is okay with me if I get 35% of all the profits.
[248:34.97]Dude, you were right, Stu!
[248:37.23]Sold.
[248:37.90]I knew he had the vibes!
[248:39.52]It passed the vibe check!
[248:41.04]Mr. President, follow us.
[248:43.00]Follow us.
[248:45.22]Now, look.
[248:45.92]Look, dude.
[248:47.27]I want to preface this.
[248:49.59]That 35%, it's locked in right now.
[248:53.00]But you understand, that's 35%.
[248:56.34]We aren't moving on that 35%, okay?
[249:00.21]Okay.
[249:01.43]Deal?
[249:02.21]Deal.
[249:02.77]Thanks for being so understanding, Mr. President, if you would go through the vines.
[249:06.74]Cruise on down here.
[249:08.67]So now, like I said, we're locked in at 35%.
[249:12.93]Welcome to our cockfighting ring, Mr. President.
[249:16.84]Only the finest cocks.
[249:18.95]Only the finest cocks are allowed here to fight.
[249:21.25]Now, I did invent recently a new style of cockfighting.
[249:24.78]I'm a little proud, okay?
[249:26.72]This is a cock battle royale.
[249:28.83]No.
[249:28.87]A cock battle royale.
[249:30.63]You see the tools, the weapons for our warriors laid out to fight.
[249:35.03]Who will win?
[249:35.89]Who will get there first?
[249:37.01]Which weapon?
[249:37.54]The saw?
[249:38.40]The cutting knife?
[249:39.18]The drill?
[249:40.92]It's endless possibilities here in the cock ring.
[249:43.36]Now, the cock ring is our main attraction.
[249:46.53]What is going on here?
[249:47.31]Every Saturday night, we pack 150 people down here and we make profit.
[249:52.99]Listen.
[249:53.69]Listen to them sing.
[249:56.42]Oh.
[249:58.11]They're ready to fight.
[249:59.17]Dude, what the fuck is all this?
[250:00.93]We are mainly a cockfighting ring, but if I made... There they go.
[250:08.25]They're riled up.
[250:09.87]Oh, shit.
[250:14.46]It's not... I thought you were just talking about marijuana.
[250:18.21]I thought this was just marijuana cigarettes.
[250:20.05]Tom the cop.
[250:20.75]Fuck!
[250:21.75]Shut up!
[250:22.63]What's going on in here?
[250:24.09]This is just some harmless cockfighting.
[250:27.22]We do fight dogs every now and then.
[250:29.34]Mr. President, if I may over here.
[250:31.90]We mainly do cockfighting, okay?
[250:34.32]But we have recently, here in this corner over here.
[250:38.67]Don't worry about those rooms.
[250:40.35]It is awful in here.
[250:42.33]You did accept the 35%, right?
[250:44.61]I don't know about this, gentlemen.
[250:46.15]What's going on in here?
[250:46.95]35%.
[250:47.75]It's supposed to be awful in here.
[250:49.80]This isn't a goddamn Ramada.
[250:51.74]This isn't a Holiday Inn or a Hilton.
[250:56.33]Now, we do do a little bit of- Excuse me, sir.
[250:58.83]Sorry, sorry.
[250:59.23]We do- No, it's okay.
[251:01.24]It's okay.
[251:02.18]Mr. President, now look.
[251:04.06]Since this is a newer version of our ventures- Over here.
[251:06.89]Over here, sir.
[251:07.39]Thank you so much.
[251:08.09]Uh-huh.
[251:09.23]We have- I will cut you in an extra percent.
[251:12.44]We did recently get into dogfighting.
[251:16.53]Okay, these are hot dogs in here.
[251:19.19]You're talking about hot dogs.
[251:22.22]You turn it on and those puppies start cooking.
[251:25.14]Oh, so it's hot dogs.
[251:27.08]You make hot dogs down here.
[251:29.55]That's a work in progress.
[251:31.69]Yeah, it's still... Okay, this is fucked up.
[251:37.62]I see.
[251:38.44]What's this chair for, by the way?
[251:41.16]Yeah, this is for people who don't cooperate.
[251:45.60]And let me tell you, the neighborhood has been extremely cooperative.
[251:50.17]Isn't that right?
[251:51.20]Since we moved in.
[251:52.76]Yes, sir.
[251:53.52]Yes, sir.
[251:55.81]How the fuck did you guys do all this?
[251:58.52]Since we moved in.
[252:00.06]I don't know what to do.
[252:01.28]Where'd the president go?
[252:03.59]Now Mr.. President I'm sure you've noticed that since we've moved in HOE fees have been on time from every member of the neighborhood.
[252:20.57]They have been Yep
[252:23.02]Let's just say that 35% is only the beginning of the benefits you have for working with us.
[252:31.23]Would you please follow me?
[252:32.75]There are cosmic benefits.
[252:35.45]There are cosmic benefits to working with us.
[252:39.84]How the fuck did you?
[252:41.30]What is happening?
[252:43.02]Oh, my God.
[252:44.34]Welcome.
[252:47.43]Welcome.
[252:48.63]Welcome, Mr. President.
[252:50.29]To the sanctuary.
[252:52.24]You're one of us now.
[252:53.52]35%.
[252:54.85]35%.
[252:55.47]Plus improved health, prolonged life.
[253:03.15]You're welcome to this neighborhood, Mr. President.
[253:05.62]This is on you.
[253:06.98]Improved night vision.
[253:09.14]I don't feel safe in this neighborhood.
[253:11.66]Incredible fertility.
[253:14.61]I can't even say on this platform what will be happening to you, but let me tell you, it's not going to be clean.
[253:21.03]Okay.
[253:22.49]You're gonna love the way you live.
[253:23.94]That's fucking sad.
[253:25.74]And the way you look.
[253:27.18]There's one more step.
[253:29.18]Okay, there's another step.
[253:31.95]If you would step forward.
[253:34.33]Do I want to step forward?
[253:36.53]Step forward!
[253:37.37]Okay, I step forward.
[253:38.47]35%!
[253:39.48]35%!
[253:43.44]Okay, I'm here.
[253:46.19]Could you lean into your webcam right now and repeat after me?
[253:49.73]I am not a member of law enforcement.

[259:59.58]It's too hard.
[260:00.34]I love the Hobbit house.
[260:01.26]I love the Hobbit house.
[260:03.26]Thank you.
[260:04.60]We took one... Oh, shit.
[260:05.90]We took one look at Bag End and knew we were fucked.
[260:09.89]Yeah, we were like, of all the teams, we get the fucking Hobbit architects?
[260:14.57]Honestly, but think about this too, right?
[260:16.21]Like, forget about all the shit you guys did underneath.
[260:19.39]This is a complete house.
[260:21.66]It's a well-executed house.
[260:23.70]It's an executed house.
[260:24.85]Fuck, I wish both could just move on.
[260:27.93]I don't think I could have clicked things faster trying to build a proper upper house.
[260:33.84]Yeah, I don't know how you managed to do both.
[260:35.42]But this, like... But this, like, the little... I could hear the music, and it's the little crouch, and... And there's a lot of detail.
[260:47.72]There's a ton of detail up here.
[260:49.00]I'm not going back to same thing.
[260:50.62]Because Jerma's chat, you've got him on camera.
[260:54.29]We're entrapment proof.
[260:57.03]I will say Mr.. President if this is gonna help if you go into their house into the kit I know you said this is the last thing this was done.
[261:03.42]You know the newest edition of the house this bathroom is fucked You can wash your hands you can wash your hands while you do your sink This whole bit is fucking amazing What the fuck
[261:25.97]It's so in-depth.
[261:29.00]I absolutely love it.
[261:30.45]Criken's like, oh, this is such an amazing build.
[261:32.20]By the way, look at this shit right here.
[261:35.45]Thank you.
[261:36.87]Alright.
[261:37.61]This is maybe my favorite.
[261:38.58]You're going to tell me probably my favorite build of the whole.
[261:40.68]Absolutely amazing.
[261:43.10]It's been an honor with all these crazy builds.
[261:45.80]Yeah.
[261:46.44]You guys are great.
[261:47.29]It's just it was literally just I had to just pick one.
[261:52.49]And it was literally both 100s.
[261:55.13]The 99s on both.
[261:56.78]It's difficult.
[261:59.80]Truly, truly fucking incredible work.
[262:01.90]Absolutely.
[262:02.36]The stories.
[262:04.31]Thanks, dude.
[262:05.13]Thanks for the invite, too, by the way.

[262:11.72]Seriously, it was fucking amazing.
[262:12.95]Yeah.
[262:13.61]It was a lot of fun, everybody.
[262:14.75]Man, the competitors were so good.
[262:16.77]Jerma, you were such a jerk having to cut somebody there.
[262:19.34]I'm going to be honest.
[262:20.12]I know.
[262:20.80]It sucks, doesn't it?
[262:21.88]It was hard to watch.
[262:22.90]I thought the comparison was great, but your decision was a little rude.
[262:27.55]I'll be real.
[262:28.69]I just wanted to check something.
[262:31.34]It's actually 25 past midnight here time in Ireland.
[262:35.45]Are we doing round two now?
[262:37.59]Yeah.
[262:38.45]Okay.
[262:39.17]I may need to go to bed.
[262:41.21]Here's the deal.
[262:41.82]Yeah, that's a fair point.
[262:42.82]I understand your feelings.
[262:44.50]Did you guys not watch Vinny?
[262:46.36]You have to do that before he makes the decision, not after he makes the decision.
[262:50.17]I didn't want to influence it.
[262:51.75]I wanted to wait.
[262:52.65]Here's what I'll say.
[262:54.13]Here's what I'll say.
[262:55.39]We have 12 people, okay?
[262:58.13]There are 12 people that are technically moving on.
[263:02.98]It's been about, what, four-ish hours?
[263:04.60]It's been four hours and 20 minutes.
[263:06.71]smoke em if you got em you guys did too good you guys did too fucking good do we want to see if people are cool with potentially having this be more than one day
[263:22.81]yes yeah oh yeah that's great if everybody's cool with that we have to obviously we got to make sure that that works for everybody people losing their mind they're so does that mean you make more money on their sponsorship
[263:38.64]Is this your plan all along?
[263:40.52]He actually probably has to make it up for Elmo's practice.
[263:43.49]Do I invoice you for the cut?
[263:45.11]Jeremy, are you really that late for your shift at Best Buy?
[263:50.50]Let me show this because I just want to make sure that everyone's good to go because the next couple of rounds are going to be nuts.
[263:57.71]So if we want to do the next two rounds on a different tomorrow.
[264:02.47]Two more rounds?
[264:03.41]There's going to be two more rounds, yeah.
[264:05.34]Oh, boy.
[264:05.52]Oh, boy.
[264:06.53]And now everybody knows what's going on.
[264:08.98]Everybody gets it.
[264:10.43]Each round is like half the length of the last one.
[264:13.54]Each round, it's going to go quicker because now there's 12 of you left.
[264:18.26]so it's gonna go much faster now that this was gonna be a big one and it was awesome I fucking cannot I cannot couldn't have asked for a better 24 people to do this because every single fucking house is incredible my face is killing me my head hurts I've been laughing for like four and a half straight hours so you've been growling
[264:40.47]When you don't know what to do when you don't know who to pick you just start growling like a dog I'm sorry.
[264:57.67]I'm sorry.
[264:58.19]It's a lot you've been teasing the shit out of this person close to me, okay Is it?
[265:06.44]Of the 12 of you, so let's put this up.
[265:08.90]I'm going to put this graphic up.
[265:10.41]Let's give it a look.
[265:12.13]Make sure I get it on the screen.
[265:16.28]Where is it?
[265:18.04]It's not this one.
[265:20.32]Where is it?
[265:22.35]It's this one.
[265:22.73]Okay.

[265:54.15]God.
[265:55.79]It's not me.
[265:57.57]So only one person potentially can't make it?
[266:01.51]Would it be same start, maybe, time?
[266:03.86]I would say we would start at the same time.
[266:06.66]Noon tomorrow.
[266:07.56]I don't think it'd be tomorrow.
[266:08.86]I could probably do it at my end, but let me get over here again.
[266:14.03]I am unfortunately not available.
[266:15.59]Yeah, I'm also a hard no.
[266:18.13]Is there a day in the next two days or three days that you guys can do the part two?
[266:25.99]I will clear my schedule for you.
[266:28.27]I can do Monday, Tuesday.
[266:30.14]That's what I'm talking about.
[266:31.92]Any big Tuesday fans, that would rule.
[266:34.33]Yeah, I'm good with Monday, Tuesday.
[266:37.20]Okay, I actually do have to check my schedule.
[266:38.74]I will let you know.
[266:40.46]I'm completely free.
[266:46.14]alright so organizing 12 streamers like on the cup is very cool Tuesday thankfully it's not 24 people that have on Tuesday so 12 of you does Tuesday work for all 12 of you no uh I have another tournament on tuesdays you got another tournament on Tuesday yeah I got the roomie rumble on Tuesday what about yeah you do what about Monday Monday
[267:11.80]I can't do Monday.
[267:13.63]What about Wednesday?
[267:15.57]Wednesday is big for me.
[267:16.21]Wednesday is good.
[267:16.93]Let's just go through them all.
[267:18.54]Hey, let's just go through every day of the week.
[267:20.22]It's Wednesday.
[267:21.56]I can't.
[267:22.26]I'm on a plane Wednesday.
[267:23.77]What the fuck?
[267:25.61]It's early Tuesday.
[267:26.75]Like, early, early.
[267:28.20]Can I throw an idea?
[267:29.52]Is it impossible to do same time next week?
[267:32.97]Like Saturday next week.
[267:34.87]I can't do that either.
[267:38.19]I'm genuinely afraid of giving some of you that much time of preparation as well.
[267:42.40]Don't worry about that.
[267:43.90]Don't worry about that because the next round is the next couple rounds is going to be some.
[267:47.78]Don't worry.
[267:48.86]Okay.
[267:49.88]Okay.
[267:50.00]Okay.
[267:50.91]Alright.
[267:51.13]So if there are a few of you that need to go, I would rather have everybody here at the same time.
[267:55.05]So is everybody cool for the same time next week?
[268:01.40]I will let you know ASAP.
[268:05.12]I might be out of town.
[268:06.49]I'm out of town, but I can find a replacement.
[268:10.13]Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[268:12.39]How many people have to leave today?
[268:13.65]12.
[268:14.03]Oh, no, no, no.
[268:16.90]I think there's four.
[268:18.40]Four people have to go.
[268:19.42]What we could do, we could get the people that are here that are like, I'm good to do it.
[268:25.22]The people that can move on.
[268:26.35]We could do that now.
[268:28.32]Oh, you could schedule like on... Yeah, that makes sense.
[268:34.40]I mean... You're going to have to do seven streams of this, Jeremiah.
[268:38.29]Hey, you know what?
[268:39.57]It's all good.
[268:40.97]Here's the thing.
[268:41.43]This next round is you are with your partner.
[268:45.62]You're with your partner and not another teammate.
[268:47.70]It's just the two of you at the same time.
[268:50.04]Oh, right, right, right.
[268:52.93]So we could actually do that if that works for everybody.
[268:55.79]Oh, squid game.
[268:57.27]Wait, what?
[268:58.23]I have to fight Stans?
[269:00.16]No, no, no, no.
[269:00.94]Nope, nope.
[269:01.50]You will be working together.
[269:03.08]Oh, okay, good, because I was not ready to kill him.
[269:07.01]I was like, I just built a home for us, so I have to rip it apart.
[269:11.69]You will stay together.
[269:13.19]Codage for lesbian breakup.
[269:15.16]The rules will be spoiled.
[269:17.62]Yeah, what we'll do is this.
[269:19.36]Grab the U-Haul quick.
[269:21.30]So how many people are good to be here right now?
[269:23.95]How many people are still here?
[269:26.01]Me.
[269:26.09]Me.
[269:26.60]The American teams.
[269:28.03]I can stay for, yeah.
[269:29.81]Me, but my ally cannot.
[269:31.92]So, okay.
[269:32.98]We will get you scheduled for when you can build a house.
[269:39.07]Yeah, I would if it was, like, right now, but it would probably be, like, another couple hours, and that's, like, 2, 2.30 in the morning, and that's getting a little bit silly.
[269:47.23]I'm sorry.
[269:48.11]No, no, it's all good.
[269:50.62]How dare you be European?
[269:52.68]I know, it's awful.
[269:55.20]We'll do, we'll get some people, we'll get some houses done.
[269:58.09]that are good to go.
[269:59.98]And then after that, we will... One person in Jerma chat says... Oh, sorry.
[270:03.70]I was muted.
[270:04.47]No, no, no.
[270:05.01]Go for it.
[270:05.31]Embarrassing.
[270:05.89]No, no, no.
[270:06.25]Now you got to read it.
[270:08.01]That was a bad idea.
[270:08.96]And that's so funny.
[270:09.74]Like, they're going to stop all of this.
[270:10.98]That just made me laugh so well.
[270:12.87]Actually, I think rescheduling is a bad idea.
[270:15.71]well here's the thing right we could just we could just get everybody together again in like the next week or so and like make it work well I agree you got you got four teams that are can stay right now right and then two that have to go so that's true but also to having everybody do it at this together I think is fun too everybody yeah okay yeah so let's do that let's do that I'd rather have everybody here because it was so fun to have everybody together I'd rather just do that again
[270:41.58]So here's... Everybody, thank you for coming.
[270:45.12]We are going to do a part two because we want everybody here.

[275:35.52]Yeah, let me take a look at the mod house.
[275:37.10]I know they were working on something.
[275:38.24]I'm curious what it is.
[275:43.63]Fix your graphics settings?
[275:44.89]What do you mean?
[275:57.92]Can I get a code for the mod house?
[276:00.48]I'm curious.
[276:08.31]You're going to do plans?
[276:09.03]Yeah, that's probably going to be it for tonight.
[276:11.46]I am so gassed right now.
[276:12.70]I'm just spent.
[276:15.50]This is working out actually perfectly, so...
[276:31.33]I watched a four-hour long comedy movie where everything was just crazy.
[276:39.94]Alright.
[276:40.16]Let me make sure I don't show this.
[276:49.90]What is being captured right now?
[276:52.04]Oh, that's what's going on.
[276:53.36]Okay.
[276:59.13]There we go.
[277:05.23]alright I'm joining I want to see what the mods built let's see what they got I don't need painkillers for my face
[277:29.56]Every time we do this, I always say, can people come up with anything new?
[277:34.85]The answer is yes, every time.
[277:39.50]Every time it's yes.
[277:46.47]Alright, so what we got?
[277:49.57]Oh, my God.
[277:50.77]They're on a call right now.
[277:51.73]Let me see what they're doing.
[277:57.78]Alright.
[277:58.28]Hey, Jerma.
[277:58.84]What's up, Josh?
[277:59.78]VRJosh.
[278:01.12]How's the building going?
[278:03.02]So, well, we had a limited budget.
[278:06.51]It was like $1 is what you gave us.
[278:09.97]Why is it so dark here?
[278:12.83]Yeah, it's always night here.
[278:16.02]You can see what we had to work with with the money we had available.
[278:19.32]A little limited.
[278:21.12]Right, right.
[278:21.66]Okay, cool.
[278:22.72]A little bit of wallpaper here and there.
[278:24.22]Wait, how did you actually get them to stick like this?
[278:27.04]It's just, you know, wallpaper.
[278:28.74]Yeah, you spit on the walls.
[278:30.15]It works.
[278:32.33]Okay.
[278:33.49]Yeah, the mod team has just been really busy the entire stream down in the offices.
[278:38.62]So we really haven't had a lot of time to work on the house.
[278:40.86]So I guess if you want to come check the mod offices, they're over here.
[278:47.43]Oh, this way.
[278:48.35]So this is where you get it.
[278:49.46]We have a mat.
[278:50.30]We have a doormat.
[278:51.62]Yeah.
[278:51.98]Oh, right.
[278:52.80]This is the office, of course.
[278:53.78]Yeah, this is where you guys are doing all your work and all the stuff.
[278:56.49]Okay.
[278:58.03]What the fuck?
[278:58.85]Okay, I thought that was actually kind of scary.
[279:02.90]I thought you put that there.
[279:04.40]I was like, what is that head?
[279:07.10]You might as well be.
[279:08.40]But yeah, you know, sometimes recruiting new bots is tough.
[279:12.67]We all know that.
[279:13.39]We've gone through the process multiple times.
[279:15.31]Sure.
[279:15.51]If they continue on, you'll reach the offices.
[279:20.13]Oh, my God.
[279:21.13]This is actually, oh, this is not good.
[279:26.32]Is this implying where you are working from?
[279:28.56]I mean, we have everything a mod could need.
[279:31.40]We all have our computers.
[279:32.44]I mean, what more could we ask for, right?
[279:34.84]Yeah, yeah, that's true.
[279:36.79]Very, very cool.
[279:37.89]What's back here?
[279:39.27]Oh, unfortunately, you don't see all the, yeah, we have a lot of images of your various streams on the wall here, but we're using image share on our end, but that's alright.
[279:49.56]This one won't even open.
[279:50.98]There's too much trash in the way.
[279:52.88]Yeah.
[279:53.34]Well, I mean, also the garbage bill hasn't been paid in a while here on the property.
[279:56.71]You can just clip through the door.
[279:58.85]Yeah, you should be able to just fly through it.
[280:02.80]Alright.
[280:03.52]Cool.
[280:04.36]This is a cool room.
[280:08.22]This actually is an elaborate desk.
[280:09.61]This is actually a lot of work going into this desk.
[280:13.47]I think there's some notes as well placed here and there, but it might be kind of hard to read.
[280:17.66]Can we get paid?
[280:18.86]Can we get more than 15 minutes of outside time?
[280:20.82]Can we get a plumber or more TP?
[280:24.02]He needs money to pay the debt.
[280:25.47]Jiggle it a little.
[280:26.13]It'll open.
[280:26.63]Important.
[280:27.05]Bad behavior equals meek.
[280:28.33]Do not peep.
[280:29.25]We cannot ask for help.
[280:31.75]I mean, these are all just general guidelines.
[280:33.66]Yeah, yeah.
[280:35.66]It's in the mod handbook.
[280:37.76]Right, yeah.
[280:38.80]Now, we did have more mods here.
[280:40.79]I don't know why... I'm not sure why nobody's in this particular office.
[280:47.25]Mm-hmm.
[280:49.42]Yeah, we had clay here earlier.
[280:51.04]Oh, okay.
[280:53.04]I like the keyboard.
[280:54.54]Oh, is that a hammer and chisel?
[280:56.21]Wait, did somebody get out?
[280:58.41]Uh, what?
[280:59.45]Is rubble on the floor here?
[281:00.99]Wait, what?
[281:02.12]What's this?
[281:05.12]Hey!
[281:05.58]I don't know.
[281:06.46]What is that?
[281:08.85]Uh-oh.
[281:09.69]Oh, no, we're all in trouble now.
[281:11.93]Okay.
[281:13.37]Very, very important question I have to ask is...
[281:16.99]Why was there a hammer here and a chisel in the first place?
[281:20.25]I mean, we had the statue of you, the 30-foot-high Jerma statue we had to work on.
[281:25.74]I guess it must have just been left after that.
[281:28.80]Oh, God damn it!
[281:32.07]Okay, alright, well... Oh, there was a growl.
[281:37.03]There was another growl.
[281:38.81]That's that growl.
[281:39.67]He growled.
[281:43.38]Well, anyways, that's the mod offices and the house.
[281:46.07]I hope you enjoy it.
[281:47.79]This actually looks great.
[281:49.15]Can I show you my cookie room?
[281:50.79]Let me see the cookie room.
[281:51.63]Where is it?
[281:52.20]Oh, yeah.
[281:52.80]I made a little cookie room here.
[281:54.66]To be fair, we worked on this a little bit ahead of time.
[281:56.98]This wasn't done midstream.
[282:01.81]Cookie, pickle, and chat.
[282:03.47]Who wins?
[282:05.72]What the hell is that?
[282:07.38]This is my cookie and pickle room.
[282:09.88]This is where I sleep.
[282:15.97]What does this say?
[282:16.77]You are fucking bald.
[282:18.74]I am not fucking bald.
[282:20.06]It's my mantra.
[282:21.99]Hey, that's mine.
[282:22.79]Oh, that's yours.
[282:23.74]Oh, I'm sorry.
[282:24.28]Here.
[282:25.04]Where was it?
[282:27.90]Why are you just moving things from my room?
[282:30.04]I literally just invited you here.
[282:31.66]I'm sorry.
[282:32.46]Drew, I thought you were putting that there to, like, say, be mean to me or something.
[282:36.11]Like, hey, look at me.
[282:37.39]Not everything is about you, Jeremy.
[282:39.21]This is mine.
[282:40.13]This is my room.
[282:44.34]Oh, that's fucking funny.
[282:45.58]Okay.
[282:47.34]Oh, yeah, there's a little window in the corner there, too, right, Drew?
[282:51.21]Yeah, my little window here.
[282:52.33]I like the giant sunflower.
[282:55.91]It's really nice.
[282:57.88]Yeah, there's a camera in there.
[283:01.69]Ooh, nice lights.
[283:03.09]I like the wallpaper.
[283:06.23]Yeah.
[283:08.48]The toilet is right in the middle.
[283:11.12]Yeah.
[283:12.76]That's my gaming chair.
[283:14.02]Ooh, I like this.
[283:18.51]Well, now they have to do it.
[283:25.39]alright very very cute that is uh anymore anything outside or inside and I think that's about all we had time for but yep actually you guys did a great job let me let me look because there's like a lot of like detail there's a lot of um I like the lighting yeah it's uh it's a little tricky when you first start playing the game because like there's a lot of controls but once you figure out everything they see the pee bucket you can do a lot oh yeah well there's that too I like the whoopee cushion
[283:53.07]I was a little worried that some of the stuff like the pee buckets here would be like too much.
[283:58.12]But then given what the other streamers did.
[284:00.34]Yeah, I mean, dude, we had a whole Elmo is has a I don't even want to repeat it.
[284:07.22]I mean, you did sign an NDA, so you shouldn't.
[284:08.98]You know, and that's why I'm not going to repeat it.
[284:11.38]There were shit rooms.
[284:13.46]There were poop.
[284:15.00]There was a whole museum of toilets.
[284:17.18]I feel like the whole day just flew by.
[284:20.53]I'm tired.
[284:22.37]I'm happy.
[284:24.43]That was great.
[284:26.46]But yeah, nice job.
[284:26.98]This is fucking funny.
[284:27.70]This is good stuff.
[284:29.96]Hey, I am the employee of the month.
[284:31.36]Thanks for having me be a part of it.
[284:33.42]Every month.
[284:34.27]I'll do it.
[284:37.07]Alright.
[284:37.51]Take it easy, guys.
[284:37.95]See you soon.
[284:39.84]That was the mod house.
[284:43.37]And a big shout out, obviously, to the mods.
[284:46.25]Because not only were they doing that, but they were corralling people, telling people where to be, helping with setting up, testing.
[284:54.32]Yeah, there's a lot that kind of went into this.
[284:56.40]Maybe it might not seem like much, but I'm excited that we get to do it again.
[285:03.43]We will get a date that everybody can do.
[285:05.61]I'd like to do it all at the same time.
[285:08.68]That was round one.
[285:10.00]And that's it.
[285:11.19]I will see you guys soon.
[285:12.85]Take care.
[285:13.25]I'll stream again.
[285:13.83]I'll be live before that.
[285:15.57]So probably in the next few days we'll get something going.
[285:19.94]And I will get you a new day for the second round.
[285:24.44]Have a great one.
[285:25.00]Take care.
[285:25.36]And see you soon.
[285:30.73]I guess we can do the credits.
[285:31.53]Why not?
[285:40.85]Yeah, make sure to follow everybody, especially considering a lot of people did that at last second.
[285:48.66]There were at least four or five people that did not know they were doing that until not even two days ago.
[286:09.42]I'll probably play Oblivion or something.
[286:10.60]I might play more Night Rain.
[286:20.79]Who's live right now?
[286:21.49]Anybody still going from the tournament?
[286:23.64]Who's still going?
[286:24.26]Let's see.
[286:30.21]Yeah, again, thank you, House Slipper, as well, for sponsoring that.
[286:33.81]And again, it was just... We could just do whatever we wanted.
[286:39.33]They were really cool about everything, so... Huge, huge shout-out to House Slipper, too.
[286:44.14]House Slipper is available.
[286:48.06]I know there's been, you know, links and... You've probably seen it pop up, but yeah, House Slipper 2.
[286:55.81]Massive, massive thank you to the House Slipper team.
[287:08.29]Let me take a look.
[287:09.05]Let's see.
[287:11.48]Are you going to play Deltarune?
[287:15.16]Um, I don't know.
[287:15.96]I don't know.
[287:16.58]I want to play it.
[287:17.20]I probably will play it off stream.
[287:18.27]At least the first few chapters again.
[287:29.02]What about that Resident Evil 9 trailer?
[287:32.20]That's true.
[287:33.03]We're going... Well, I don't want to spoil it if no one's seen it, but it's cool that we're going kind of, you know, going somewhere.
[287:42.30]I'm very interested in it.
[287:47.22]Oh, my God.
[287:47.89]Okay, so let's open this up.
[287:54.09]And what do we got?
[287:54.99]Let's see.
[287:58.08]A lot of people are still alive.
[288:06.24]Dude, you know what?
[288:07.28]You know what I'm going to hit you with?
[288:09.73]I'm going to hit you.
[288:10.29]You know what I'm going to hit you with?
[288:12.67]I'm going to hit you with the Stans raid.
[288:16.08]Let's go raid Stans.
[288:21.65]Stans is a great guy.
[288:23.49]He was very helpful, too, when we were looking for some last-minute replacements.
[288:27.19]He was on it with a couple other people, so Stans is great.
[288:35.47]Goes ahead of stands.
[288:36.37]Also, one of my co-workers from Offbrand.
[288:43.24]He's a great dude.
[288:58.72]Yeah, and the next stream of this, we will figure it out.
[289:04.66]And it'll be cool.
[289:06.47]Go say hi to Stan's.
[289:07.53]Take care.
[289:07.99]See you soon.
[289:10.11]We'll stream again in the next few days.
[289:14.06]See you later.
[289:15.38]Call your mother.
[289:59.78]you
