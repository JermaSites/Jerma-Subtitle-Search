[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.25]It's a late night tonight.
[00:01.39]Late start tonight.
[00:04.37]Shit.
[00:05.37]Don't wake up your parents.
[00:06.39]How's everybody doing?
[00:09.56]How are you?
[00:11.36]You know me.
[00:12.58]You already know who I am.
[00:15.66]Finally, now it's time to go to bed.
[00:22.48]I've had a very disappointing day today.
[00:26.21]Are you ready to get vented at?
[00:29.87]Now, this could have been a much more anger-riddled rant maybe three hours ago.
[00:37.09]Some of you were in the chat, and I was a little irritated.
[00:41.13]Just maybe slightly, not very much.
[00:44.20]Hold on, let me just open up my... I deserve this, okay?
[00:46.58]It's a Powerade.
[00:48.32]Yep.
[00:49.38]I need these electrolytes today.
[00:51.10]I deserve a purple Powerade.
[00:58.62]Uh, my Vive is broken.
[01:01.88]That's not even a joke.
[01:03.04]It sucks.
[01:04.62]I don't know what's wrong with it.
[01:05.63]I don't know what happened.
[01:10.83]I streamed VR.
[01:13.71]Like, what?
[01:16.17]A year ago?
[01:18.03]Eight months ago?
[01:20.66]I finished with it.
[01:21.56]Okay, we'll put it in the box for a little while.
[01:24.12]I put the damn thing in the box.
[01:27.55]close it up nothing happened to it I didn't like drop kick this thing into the closet but I I got it out today we were gonna do uh vr I was gonna come back and why hey look okay this I already was streaming on this thing I've already got it to work like a year ago
[01:50.56]So I take it out of the box.
[01:51.60]I start plugging shit in.
[01:53.32]And things are going fine.
[01:54.16]My lighthouses are fine.
[01:55.34]They're connected.
[01:55.98]They're green.
[01:56.46]Everything's fine.
[01:57.70]But the headset doesn't work.
[02:00.62]I cannot get the headset to get recognized.
[02:03.44]No matter what I do.
[02:04.26]I was sitting here for six and a half hours.
[02:07.76]I was about to reinstall Windows.
[02:11.42]That was the final straw.
[02:13.36]But it was going to take too long.
[02:16.29]And I can play this game that we're going to play tonight.
[02:19.20]Not on VR.
[02:20.10]I'm going to be the one person in this lobby not playing VR.
[02:22.58]I'm going to be a default regular screen guy.
[02:27.46]Which, that's stupid.
[02:28.56]I'm going to be playing with Vinny, Ross, and Giwi.
[02:34.53]I hope I'm saying that name right.
[02:37.47]It should be fun.
[02:38.39]I mean, it's a ghost hunting game.
[02:39.63]I'm sure it'll be cool.
[02:42.74]But I tried everything.
[02:44.42]Different USBs, different connectors.
[02:48.29]I've reinstalled SteamVR, SteamVR Beta, SteamVR Alpha.
[02:54.93]I uninstalled Steam, reinstalled Steam, I restarted my computer a hundred times.
[02:59.57]I did every Reddit fix, and usually the Reddit fixes work really well.
[03:02.86]The Reddit fixes work very well.
[03:05.58]None of them worked.
[03:07.20]It's error code 108, and I think my headset's just fucking broken.
[03:13.02]I don't know how.
[03:15.78]Drivers, did them all.
[03:16.66]Did all the drivers.
[03:17.35]Updated every driver.
[03:18.05]Guys, I even updated the drivers on your computer that you never update.
[03:25.79]I updated my like HID mouse compliant driver.
[03:31.10]You don't even need that.
[03:32.64]And I got it.
[03:37.25]Every single driver.
[03:39.69]I don't know what happened.
[03:40.49]I'm getting a new computer.
[03:41.41]Fuck this.
[03:42.81]I'm going to have a new computer.
[03:45.26]This time next July.
[03:47.00]No, soon.
[03:47.98]Within a month.
[03:49.16]I'm getting a new computer within the next month.
[03:50.64]Within the next couple of weeks.
[03:57.31]We'll see.
[04:02.98]But for now, I'm going to be joined pretty shortly here by Vinny.
[04:11.38]Well, you know I love Vinny.
[04:15.09]Me and Vinny have been trying to, hey, you want to do something?
[04:17.27]Let's do like a stream together.
[04:19.15]Hey, bingo.
[04:21.19]VR stream.
[04:22.43]That's right.
[04:24.07]Oh, but my VR is broken.
[04:26.23]Oh, it's all right.
[04:31.42]It still should be fun.
[04:32.76]This is probably not going to be a very long stream because it's starting so late.
[04:40.24]And we got FTK to look forward to this weekend.
[04:43.62]Which not much anybody has to do to prepare for that.
[04:47.47]I'm probably going to go live on Friday or even later today.
[04:55.13]Like tonight before I turn this off.
[04:57.29]And just kind of answer questions.
[05:04.07]Let's see.
[05:07.01]Server version mismatch?
[05:13.73]What?
[05:14.09]Why are you saying server version mismatch?
[05:19.32]Why is everybody saying that?
[05:22.04]That's what Vinny is saying.
[05:24.28]Wait, I have the wrong version of the game?
[05:27.56]Wait, can VR people not play VR?
[05:31.97]with non-VR people.
[05:33.12]Don't make me even more sad than I already am today.
[05:35.92]Don't make me even more sad.
[05:38.58]No, they can't.
[05:39.08]All right, all right.
[05:39.96]I'm gonna, let me reboot the game.
[05:42.82]I'm gonna reboot the game.
[05:44.29]I guess there was an update today.
[05:48.01]Okay.
[05:48.59]Don't make me even more sad than I already am.
[05:56.52]Restarting game.
[05:58.34]Let's see if there's an update.
[06:03.42]Oh, and by the way, we were gonna, like, add each other on Steam and shit, and I went into my friends.
[06:08.52]I have, like, a thousand group invites.
[06:10.84]I tried to decline the first one to make some room, and my computer hang.
[06:15.14]Steam, like, crashed.
[06:17.37]Come on, Valve!
[06:19.87]Do I have to individually click on every single one of these?
[06:23.73]Mr. Popular?
[06:24.59]No, no, this is over the course of, like, eight years.
[06:28.87]This didn't happen, like, last weekend.
[06:30.92]God, I need some of this Powerade right now.
[06:35.06]Oh, let's see.
[06:35.56]Is it updated?
[06:37.88]Alright, my phasmophobia is updated right now.
[06:41.06]Should be good.
[06:41.42]Yeah, we're just chillin'.
[06:44.24]We're just chillin'.
[06:44.76]We're just chillin'.
[06:46.48]Guys, this is a late night stream.
[06:49.83]This is an extra late night stream.
[06:52.51]Get some of those fuckin' electrolytes, Zuby.
[06:57.07]Alright, loading game.
[07:02.79]I'm probably gonna have to give the new friend code.
[07:08.58]It's more like extra early for the... Hey, Storm!
[07:10.56]Thanks for the 10 subs.
[07:11.83]I know I'm gonna have face cam on tonight, but I haven't switched over yet because I don't want to leak the friend code.
[07:17.07]Okay, private game.
[07:20.59]Let's see.
[07:23.53]Alright, I got a new... Let's see.
[07:26.97]They can just join off the friend code, right?
[07:34.19]Yeah, they can.
[07:35.19]Cool.
[07:35.33]Is this game... Is this game... Is this game...
[07:39.04]Here.
[07:40.30]Ready?
[07:43.00]Ready to see me?
[07:43.65]I don't know.
[07:44.91]Am I ready to be on camera?
[07:52.65]I didn't leak it.
[07:54.27]I didn't leak it.
[07:54.87]I'm good.
[07:57.59]I got the invite code.
[07:58.67]Oh, don't you wish you knew what that fucking friend invite code was.
[08:03.04]Whoa, dude.
[08:03.52]Vinesauce just joined my lobby?
[08:08.30]Boop boop.
[08:09.69]It's been a rough day today.
[08:12.39]Hang on.
[08:12.91]Sorry about the noises.
[08:16.17]Fire alarm going off?
[08:20.00]One second, chat.
[08:21.46]This fire alarm?
[08:22.88]Is there a fire in Vinny's house?
[08:26.74]How do I... I can hear him.
[08:34.95]I can't look at the board because I think the code's up there.
[08:37.87]So, um... Germa?
[08:39.87]Can you hear me?
[08:42.99]I can see him.
[08:44.40]Wait, hold on.
[08:45.90]Can he not hear me?
[08:46.48]I don't think he can hear me.
[08:50.60]Press V. Can you hear me?
[08:53.28]Oh, yeah.
[08:54.26]Oh, nice.
[08:55.00]It's V. It's Vinny.
[08:57.68]Hi.
[08:58.41]Hey.
[08:58.83]Well, it's V to talk, too.
[09:00.83]What's up, man?
[09:01.65]Oh, hey.
[09:02.49]How you doing, man?
[09:03.99]It's nice to talk to you again.
[09:07.09]I thought there was a fire alarm going off in your house.
[09:11.31]Wait, what?
[09:11.73]Does it sound bad?
[09:13.08]No, I get to- I just hear like a... Chat, do you hear a... No, don't show my fucking wart hand.
[09:27.22]Why do I hear that?
[09:28.22]Is that in my- is that in my house?
[09:31.73]Are you okay?
[09:32.41]Do you need assistance?
[09:34.55]What is my house?
[09:35.71]It's like burning.
[09:39.87]I hear crickets.
[09:42.44]I usually do when I stream, but that's... Yeah, me too.
[09:46.28]Me too.
[09:48.44]Can I make it so that I don't have to push the talk?
[09:51.02]This audio sounds pretty good.
[09:53.68]It's good, yeah.
[09:55.04]I don't know, though.
[09:56.30]There's some options, but it's a little lacking on the VR end.
[10:00.57]How is the VR, by the way?
[10:04.39]It would be better for you because you have a Vive, but it's not very index friendly.
[10:10.65]Yeah, I wish I could be there in the VR.
[10:11.69]It's cool, though.
[10:13.81]Yeah, so, chat, Jerma has some VR issues.
[10:17.21]Headset, like, just not turning on issues.
[10:21.95]Yeah, I don't know what happened.
[10:23.85]I've been trying to troubleshoot for the last six hours.
[10:25.80]I have no idea what's wrong with my computer or what's wrong with the headset.
[10:28.86]All I know is that I'm going to throw it into the garbage disposal and turn it on as high as it can go.
[10:35.66]Well, at six hours, you'll never get back, but maybe this will be worth it.
[10:41.39]Hey, it's always worth it.
[10:43.69]It's always worth it if we get to do something together.
[10:48.97]That is just fantastic.
[10:50.95]Thank you, Jeremiah.
[10:51.47]Remember the last time we did something together?
[10:53.35]It was Red Dead Redemption 2.
[10:54.54]My computer sucked on that one, too.
[10:57.68]Should I just go stream at an internet cafe or something?
[11:02.28]You could go to a McDonald's.
[11:06.22]No, I think that was Rockstar's fault more than anything.
[11:10.30]Yeah, maybe.
[11:11.48]It was still funny, though.
[11:12.26]So we can just blame Rockstar.
[11:14.64]I have a question for you.
[11:15.92]Is the code of this room on the screen right now on that wall?
[11:20.60]The way that you did that, you're just presenting.
[11:23.23]Yeah, I think it's hidden, but maybe it's only hidden from me.
[11:28.65]Should I look?
[11:29.47]I don't want to risk it.
[11:30.49]Can you see it?
[11:35.48]oh you're gonna need a new code my dude new code all right yeah well I guess I guess I can't hide it for everybody well no hey look at this nobody's joining oh give him a minute um ross is probably still doing the tutorial but uh yeah I'll just take a seat while this is happening
[12:04.46]Yeah, I, uh... I did the tutorial a little bit, but I kinda don't really know what it means.
[12:10.00]I know that we have devices, we have to put books on the ground, and the ghost writes in the book, and... Something like that.
[12:16.84]You get a flashlight, you get a computer, a camera.
[12:19.64]I have no idea how to play this game.
[12:21.02]Yeah.
[12:22.17]So there's, um... I got a kind of an idea.
[12:25.05]Have you ever watched Ghost Adventures?
[12:28.47]Ghost Adventures?
[12:31.05]Or, uh, any of the Ghost Hunter shows?
[12:35.50]Well, the ones with everyone, he's green.
[12:38.22]Everyone's lit up and overexposed and green.
[12:41.20]Right.
[12:42.00]Yeah, I've seen clips.
[12:44.32]Yeah, so it's just a variety of tools that you use to discover spooky ghosts.
[12:51.02]And who is this?
[12:52.49]I don't know.
[12:58.17]Uh-oh.
[12:59.27]Uh-oh.
[12:59.55]Uh-oh.
[12:59.95]Weird.
[13:00.29]I think I can boot him.
[13:12.86]What happened?
[13:14.76]Alright, new code!
[13:15.68]New code!
[13:16.02]Let's- I'm gonna turn this off.
[13:17.99]I don't want you guys to see it either.
[13:20.41]I gotta make it so I can fucking not have push to- I don't want to do push to talk.
[13:23.13]By the way, this game records all of everything you say.
[13:25.65]It's like a- It's like speech recognition.
[13:28.31]You're like- You actually talk to the ghosts.
[13:29.79]Alright, hold on.
[13:34.24]Audio... Uh, where is it?
[13:36.92]Where is it?
[13:37.26]Controls?
[13:37.96]PC settings.
[13:42.32]Vocal push to talk off.
[13:44.58]Right?
[13:44.78]Let's just keep that off.
[13:49.44]Booted Vinny.
[13:50.06]Well, I don't know.
[13:50.61]That guy might have just started screaming swears.
[13:52.41]We've got to be careful.
[13:54.53]Alright, let's try this.
[13:57.75]Alright, I got a new code.
[13:59.53]I don't want you to see it.
[14:01.65]I'm going to type it in here.
[14:02.62]This is a late night stream, guys.
[14:05.88]Relax.
[14:06.12]Relax.
[14:12.67]Okay.
[14:15.95]Late night stream.
[14:19.41]Got chocolate hair.
[14:21.95]Whatever.
[14:22.57]That doesn't bother me right now.
[14:24.17]What bothers me right now is my Vive being broken.
[14:29.74]I was going to play Half- Alyx next week and like, no, what am I going to do?
[14:32.74]What am I going to do with this thing?
[14:34.66]I got to get like a new computer.
[14:41.22]Oh, Ross just asked in the Discord, hey, I'm out of the tutorial.
[14:44.40]What now?
[14:44.84]I just wrote a series of numbers.
[14:47.90]Uh, that, I don't know if they know what that means.
[14:49.98]Oh, hold on.
[14:55.25]Oh, oh, hey.
[14:56.87]Oh, can you hear me?
[14:57.59]Without the push talk?
[15:00.01]Yeah.
[15:00.53]Yes!
[15:03.83]So, we can change our characters too, apparently.
[15:07.69]Yeah, we can.
[15:09.60]We could be whoever we want.
[15:11.40]Wait, we can all be the same person?
[15:16.36]There's some people.
[15:20.19]Alright, so when we select a job, what do you guys want to do for a job?
[15:29.04]um I'm not too sure also ross and giwi if you guys are talking we don't we don't hear you yeah you gotta hold v or you gotta go in your pc settings you gotta scroll all the way down and turn off the local push to talk I think they're in vr though oh wait their hands are wacky they're stuck in vr mode yeah you know you don't hear the uh like the fire alarm no that's so funny I wonder why
[16:01.22]What about, okay, jobs?
[16:02.26]Select a job.
[16:04.77]No contracts.
[16:05.41]Yeah, I don't have that option.
[16:07.61]Okay, um... This is like a Powerpuff Girls, uh, Genndy Tartofsky version of the United States and Canada.
[16:15.38]We have Edgefield, which is California.
[16:19.94]Rafton Farmhouse, which looks like it's in Texas.
[16:22.88]Or Ridgeview Roadhouse, which looks like it's somewhere in Michigan.
[16:28.61]um michigan sounds pretty haunted in general yeah I mean michigan's bordering lake erie right oh that's right that's right it is all right so this is called difficulty amateur recommended team size two we got four we are right um that's the movements you do when you're like in the shower ross and giwi once again if you guys are talking we don't hear you hear you at all on this end
[16:57.64]You're karate chopping pretty nicely in the air.
[16:59.60]Yeah, I was gonna say, that's like, that's like, that's when you do that when you're, like, bathing, like, when you're trying to get, like, under your armpits.
[17:07.07]Uh, so this is, this is, uh, two-story, four-bedroom house with a basement.
[17:11.83]We just got confirmation of a possible ghost sighting here.
[17:15.25]This one sounds, is there guns in this game?
[17:16.59]Like, are we gonna get, if we get guns?
[17:20.01]I don't know if that would work.
[17:22.43]This one sounds dangerous, so you'll have to be careful with this one.
[17:24.71]Gather evidence and leave as soon as you can.
[17:26.27]More info when you arrive.
[17:30.54]Sounds easy.
[17:30.96]The guns are for each other.
[17:32.14]Like, in case we betray each other and scare each other.
[17:37.77]Looks like a... Alright, who is who here?
[17:40.23]I keep people keep... No, is that me?
[17:41.97]Who should I be?
[17:45.64]Yeah, so, every... Like, we're kind of all the same character right now, but I imagine when we spawn in, we'll all be a different character.
[17:54.64]Uh, RobloxRawRTTV.
[17:58.75]That's Ross, yeah.
[18:01.52]That's a pretty good name.
[18:03.96]I'll be this dude.
[18:04.90]I'll be, um, Zuckerberg.
[18:06.70]That's fine.
[18:07.12]Uh, I'm just gonna be... I don't know.
[18:14.18]Guy with jacket, too.
[18:16.62]So, so Ross and Giwi are both leaving, and they're gonna do some settings and try to come back.
[18:21.84]Okay, yeah.
[18:23.78]I'm good, man.
[18:24.34]We're just chillin'.
[18:26.88]I usually... How are you?
[18:29.10]I've been pretty good.
[18:30.60]Hope you've been good, too.
[18:32.77]Yeah, I've been doing alright.
[18:34.15]I, uh... I've adapted to our nightmare world a little bit.
[18:39.41]Yeah.
[18:40.43]It's been kind of chaotic, but... Yeah, you know, you just do what you gotta do.
[18:47.16]Hopefully we can get back to fucking normal soon in the next few months, I hope.
[18:53.62]Yeah.
[18:54.82]I mean, until then, though, we at least have ghost hunting.
[18:57.82]At least we have ghost hunting.
[18:58.66]At least we have green overexposed face show.
[19:02.74]Yeah.
[19:03.20]Oh, sorry.
[19:03.48]Green overexposed face show with camera pointing up to chin.
[19:08.82]Getting, like, weird profile, like, below under profile of face.
[19:14.29]Really, like, just disturbing visions of humanity from that show.
[19:17.95]Um, but also, you have to wonder, like, when they... When they do that, like, do they accidentally pick up semen that they have to edit out?
[19:27.96]Wait, what?
[19:28.94]Like, what's that stain on the kitchen table?
[19:31.86]And it's like, oh, oh, God, me and the husband, we were, wow.
[19:35.06]Just ignore it.
[19:38.67]It's everywhere.
[19:41.19]This whole house is just covered with ectoplasm.
[19:43.89]How did it get on top of the cabinets in the kitchen?
[19:47.83]Well, I mean, the ghost must have been up there and probably got a late night snack.
[19:53.26]Gordon Ramsay on the case.
[19:57.36]He did a hotel show.
[19:59.02]He did a hotel show where, like, you know, this is a Michelin star winning chef, and he, like, goes into these, like, disgusting hotel rooms, and he, like, shines the flashlight, the black light, on, like, the bed.
[20:09.43]And he's like, oh!
[20:10.97]Oh, it's fucking disgusting!
[20:12.67]Jesus!
[20:16.65]While you're telling this, I just, there's still somebody's house on fire.
[20:21.92]Do you still hear it?
[20:22.76]It's, like, makes this whole conversation that much funnier.
[20:27.21]Because I'm just not even... We're apparently not even paying attention to the fact that the room we're in is on fire?
[20:33.11]Oh, no.
[20:33.73]My room is all good.
[20:34.61]I don't hear a thing.
[20:36.31]I hear crickets, man.
[20:38.65]Wait a minute.
[20:39.85]Wait, wait, wait.
[20:40.69]Walk.
[20:41.23]Keep walking.
[20:44.13]I'm walking.
[20:44.69]Walk really close to me.
[20:47.13]Walking.
[20:47.85]I'm in... I'm through you.
[20:50.56]Okay.
[20:51.56]Now walk backwards.
[20:56.20]But go far away.
[21:01.58]You're the fire alarm.
[21:02.58]You're the fire alarm guy.
[21:04.48]I'm the fire alarm?
[21:05.46]You're the fire alarm guy.
[21:09.56]The fuck?
[21:10.64]Do you have like a pager, like a ghost pager that's going off?
[21:15.23]No, I have nothing.
[21:16.79]What the hell?
[21:20.77]It's like one of those tools.
[21:23.21]People are saying it's V-sync effects of voice chat.
[21:27.80]No, no way.
[21:32.18]V-sync effects on voice chat?
[21:34.28]Isn't that a video thing?
[21:35.16]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[21:41.55]It's your mic feedback, probably?
[21:44.37]Is it, though?
[21:44.93]Alright, hold on.
[21:46.77]If I... Walkie on shoulder.
[21:48.37]I have a walkie-talkie on my shoulder.
[21:49.87]Hang on a minute.
[21:50.85]I was gonna cover my mic with my hands and be like, Okay, talk now!
[21:57.12]I don't have a walkie-talkie.
[21:59.14]I wish I could look.
[21:59.86]Left shoulder.
[22:01.97]Because I have to stare at the board.
[22:04.55]You do?
[22:04.85]Because I'm Mr. Lobby.
[22:06.61]I'm Mr. Guy that runs the lobby.
[22:09.90]Oh, they want to get in a call.
[22:10.98]Like an actual call.
[22:11.74]Like Discord call.
[22:15.88]That's going to be tough because I'm sitting on my couch.
[22:21.20]This headset is not set up for Discord.
[22:24.08]I wouldn't be able to broadcast it.
[22:27.58]Hmm.
[22:30.37]I can relay what they're saying to you.
[22:37.94]Vinny, stand up, you bum.
[22:40.32]I wish I was on VR on the couch right now so bad.
[22:44.26]I know.
[22:45.65]But you can't do sitting VR.
[22:47.29]You become goblin when you sit.
[22:48.75]Hey, do you still hear the walkie-talkie?
[22:50.99]The fire alarm?
[22:52.63]I do.
[22:53.77]I'm kind of used to it now.
[22:55.15]It's kind of just there.
[22:57.01]If you turned it off, I'd probably miss it.
[23:01.34]The proximity in-game chat is way better than Discord for this as one of my chat members.
[23:08.31]Look down.
[23:08.87]It's on your left shoulder.
[23:11.33]Somebody said that this game is meant to be played without Discord because it's proximity.
[23:23.87]You cannot take it off.
[23:24.93]Walkie on left shoulder.
[23:26.10]I promise you, chat.
[23:27.12]I'm grabbing.
[23:27.88]I'm looking for walkie.
[23:29.00]I can't find it.
[23:30.84]Chat, the radio does not work in the lobby.
[23:34.32]It's inside your neck.
[23:35.82]Chat, I swear to Christ.
[23:37.58]There's escape?
[23:40.24]Oh, shit.
[23:40.72]I can move.
[23:42.60]Let me see if I can turn it off for you.
[23:46.88]What are you sitting on?
[23:49.54]I'm not sitting anymore.
[23:50.76]Why do you have a hula hoop?
[23:53.02]Oh, we all have that.
[23:54.02]That's our utility belt in VR.
[23:57.26]You don't have one, but... I know.
[24:03.45]Okay, I'm gonna walk this way.
[24:05.13]Wait, is it something on the... I thought that was a gun.
[24:10.67]I thought you just shot a gun at me.
[24:16.49]It's just like trying to find a smoke detector that is running out of battery.
[24:22.35]It's like, dude, is it in the fucking wall?
[24:23.99]Is it in the brick?
[24:25.35]Did somebody... A hundred years ago... Leave one in the wall when they built the house?
[24:33.49]Oh, what?
[24:33.97]You can do basketball!
[24:41.36]I want... It's not that fun.
[24:43.32]It's more fun than... I mean, let's... Yeah, let me try.
[24:46.68]Oh, hey.
[24:50.36]Ross.
[24:53.68]So we can't actually verbally communicate.
[24:58.52]If you can hear me, nod.
[25:03.73]If you can hear me, do this.
[25:09.51]Oh.
[25:13.59]They can't hear you.
[25:17.15]He's not getting your audio.
[25:19.04]Is he getting me?
[25:20.92]I can hear you.
[25:21.66]Can you hear Jerma?
[25:23.53]Can you hear me?
[25:24.17]What's this?
[25:28.19]Vinny, do you have... He's trying to communicate non-verbally.
[25:30.74]Do you have the Vive headphones plugged in?
[25:34.90]Is it a microphone?
[25:35.90]I forget how it works.
[25:37.28]It's the Index.
[25:38.94]It's just in there.
[25:40.56]Oh, it's just in there.
[25:42.26]Yeah.
[25:47.01]It's a SteamVR audio setting.
[25:51.57]Oh.
[25:54.85]headset audio output device headset audio input device headset audio mirroring on uh no everyone restart should just restart their game the headed what is it if germa can hear you and ross can't you need to reboot yeah you're the only one I can hear benny I can't hear it if they're talking I can't hear them
[26:28.05]Someone said, make sure the checkmarks are blue.
[26:30.59]Blue checkmarks have better opinions.
[26:34.04]Do you have a blue checkmark, Vinny?
[26:38.16]No.
[26:39.04]Neither do I. What the fuck?
[26:40.90]Yeah.
[26:42.04]No, it's all good, dude.
[26:43.32]Don't worry about it.
[26:44.30]I want my, like, four tweets a year to be proven that it's me and not some fake baker.
[26:51.60]Why not get, like, a red checkmark instead?
[26:55.22]Just don't listen to me.
[26:56.26]Give me the red checkmark.
[26:58.00]Yeah, the red checkmark is this is like worse opinion central stuff.
[27:03.06]You don't want to listen to this guy?
[27:07.27]Not even good enough to be fake.
[27:11.83]Dude, I took two sips of this and I feel like so much better.
[27:15.81]What are the sips?
[27:16.49]What is it?
[27:16.99]Is it this oxygen?
[27:18.83]Powerade.
[27:19.41]Purple Powerade.
[27:21.91]Oh, in real life?
[27:22.97]Yeah, IRL.
[27:23.57]Okay.
[27:25.08]Oh, okay.
[27:26.34]Just trying to like... Whoa, that's trippy.
[27:33.68]Weird sounds coming from your shoulder.
[27:38.59]I love how you just have this weird loud beeping implant on you somewhere that you can't find.
[27:44.11]It's so funny.
[27:46.60]Hey, tell me.
[27:47.16]Can you hear me?
[27:47.64]If I do this, can you hear me?
[27:50.14]Do I cut out at all?
[27:52.24]No, you're good.
[27:53.08]It's solid.
[27:54.02]Okay.
[27:58.76]it just stopped for a second it's it's it restarted it's off it's off it's gone you just did it you just turned it off and now it's back on I didn't I didn't it's back on what if I don't move I'm not moving wait are you so low to the ground because you're sitting on a couch
[28:21.33]I'm sitting on my couch.
[28:22.41]So you are sitting, but you need to be walking in VR.
[28:25.61]So you're just going to be... I'm going to be a crab.
[28:29.35]Yeah, yeah.
[28:34.48]Is the beeping still happening?
[28:36.02]Yeah, you turned it off for like two seconds, and then it came back on.
[28:41.08]I'm going to restart, and I'll be back.
[28:44.67]All right, the code shouldn't change.
[28:46.05]All right.
[28:52.81]That's so funny.
[28:53.63]He's sitting on his couch.
[28:55.70]So he's constantly just, he's just going to be like shifting around.
[28:58.72]It stops.
[28:59.22]Yeah.
[29:06.32]The late night stream.
[29:10.60]Or stream 2020.
[29:11.32]That's not true.
[29:12.86]You can't say that.
[29:13.48]This doesn't count.
[29:14.44]This is a late night stream.
[29:15.50]Late night bonus stream.
[29:16.86]Can you hear me?
[29:17.58]Hello?
[29:18.18]I can hear you.
[29:18.86]Hello?
[29:19.88]Oh my god.
[29:20.52]Oh my god.
[29:20.98]Holy shit.
[29:22.25]So I figured out what it is.
[29:24.77]If you alt tab on this game, it kills the microphone.
[29:28.83]Oh.
[29:29.21]Alright.
[29:29.53]I won't do that.
[29:30.61]So I wasn't able to hide the code.
[29:35.95]There's no way to get in here without me...
[29:38.68]Yeah, okay, we got everyone.
[29:39.64]Can you hear me?
[29:40.20]Can you hear me?
[29:40.66]Hello?
[29:40.96]Hello?
[29:41.94]Finally, yeah.
[29:43.32]Okay, so, chat explained that this game breaks if you alt-tab.
[29:49.44]Can Vinny hear us?
[29:50.28]Oh, no, Vinny's gone.
[29:51.02]How come you guys aren't beeping?
[29:53.91]Why are none of you guys beeping?
[29:55.05]Beeping?
[29:56.15]Were we beeping before?
[29:57.53]Oh, no, Vinny has, like, a fire alarm thing on his shoulder.
[30:00.21]We can't turn it off.
[30:00.95]We're trying to figure out how to turn it off.
[30:02.87]He has a fire alarm?
[30:04.65]I want a fire alarm.
[30:05.95]We both thought our houses were on fire.
[30:07.67]Is it...
[30:08.61]Hi.
[30:10.49]Vinny, is your house on fire?
[30:14.01]No.
[30:14.37]Can you hear me, though?
[30:15.89]Yeah, we can hear you.
[30:17.75]Wow, you're loud.
[30:20.04]I'm loud?
[30:21.36]Yeah, Jerma's real low, and you're loud.
[30:23.64]You look insane.
[30:25.36]You're like dog bum wiping on the ground.
[30:31.74]Come get my butt.
[30:34.43]I'm just sitting.
[30:36.35]But we need to equalize volume.
[30:39.39]Am I a fire alarm still?
[30:41.83]Yeah.
[30:42.61]A bit, yeah.
[30:45.94]Ross, you gotta turn the volume down a little bit, dog.
[30:48.26]Can I turn my volume down?
[30:50.02]Yeah, I can hear my voice.
[30:52.32]I can hear my voice through your mic.
[30:54.77]Oh, shit.
[30:56.16]Okay, hold on.
[30:57.00]This game... You guys just did the Spider-Man thing.
[31:01.14]You guys just did the Spider-Man thing pointing at each other and saying, I'm you.
[31:05.98]Apparently you can... Oh, I can't... What, yeah?
[31:09.03]You can adjust people's volume when you're in-game.
[31:11.89]Oh, we'll just do that.
[31:13.89]How about this?
[31:15.83]Vinny, would you prefer it if I talked like this?
[31:20.75]That's weird.
[31:21.65]I don't get to do the weird VR stuff.
[31:23.40]I'm jealous.
[31:24.58]Help me.
[31:25.68]Germa, help me.
[31:26.90]I wish I could.
[31:27.46]I wish you could put my hands out in VR and grab your hands.
[31:29.80]I can't.
[31:33.11]I just have an Overwatch crosshair.
[31:36.09]Cool.
[31:38.79]Do you want to do a first-person shooter ghost hunt?
[31:41.12]I can arrange.
[31:42.36]We can find a game.
[31:43.18]Hey, Vinny.
[31:45.46]Yeah, Ross.
[31:45.92]All right, so we have a job.
[31:46.96]Your arm's gone.
[31:49.30]Hey, by the way, do you guys know how to play this game?
[31:52.50]Because I didn't process the tutorial at all.
[31:54.74]We have a flashlight.
[31:55.76]It was hard.
[31:56.60]Yeah, it was kind of weird.
[31:59.06]I got the tutorial a little bit.
[32:01.02]We'll never lose, Vinny.
[32:06.27]Just like for the free crab walking around.
[32:10.05]Let me check my chat.
[32:10.91]Chat, do you have any idea how to fix this?
[32:12.85]Please help.
[32:13.57]Please help.
[32:17.26]I- I'm- I'm- should we ready up?
[32:19.72]I- I just said I was ready.
[32:20.64]Yeah, I think we're good, dude.
[32:22.08]I- I'm ready.
[32:22.44]The alarm's gonna scare the ghosts.
[32:23.54]Yeah, it really might.
[32:24.32]Okay, do we get, like, chased Michael Myers style?
[32:26.23]Do we get, like, attacked or anything?
[32:27.15]Or how does this work?
[32:28.85]Yeah.
[32:29.89]If... If anybody wants to see what it looks like, come to my screen and look.
[32:34.59]Oh, I didn't even tweet this.
[32:37.09]What a terrible streamer.
[32:38.03]Can you hear the... the, uh... alarm?
[32:39.79]Is it gone?
[32:41.11]No.
[32:41.63]Do our characters, like, change once we end our game?
[32:43.75]Because right now we're all at the same wall, right?
[32:45.57]Yeah.
[32:45.79]I- I think they should.
[32:48.46]Are you sure your house isn't burning down?
[32:52.91]Oh, I swear to God.
[32:54.67]My chat doesn't hear it.
[32:57.17]Literally, come watch from my perspective for a second.
[33:01.15]You'll see exactly what we're all hearing.
[33:03.91]I hear it through your microphone.
[33:05.29]Yeah, you can hear it through my mic?
[33:06.61]Yeah, I can.
[33:10.19]Are you guys ready to go hunt some ghosts?
[33:11.45]It's so stupid.
[33:12.63]Are you guys ready to scream?
[33:14.01]Yeah, everybody ready up.
[33:15.54]Are you guys ready to scream?
[33:19.88]Uh, Vinny, you got it ready up?
[33:21.01]Up top.
[33:21.45]Oh, yes.
[33:22.27]Yes.
[33:23.31]I'm ready.
[33:23.69]Let's see.
[33:24.09]Hopefully it'll stop when we get in-game.
[33:26.01]I hope it doesn't for some reason.
[33:27.35]Is that bad for me to say that?
[33:29.03]I hope it does not stop.
[33:31.16]I kind of hope it continues.
[33:34.20]Someone said it's the crickets on my end.
[33:36.06]I switch hats.
[33:36.86]Those are in-game crickets.
[33:38.69]Those are the crickets.
[33:42.48]Alright, is everybody ready?
[33:43.12]Start.
[33:43.94]Wait, do we have enough, like, stuff?
[33:46.38]Oh yeah, duct tape, scotch tape.
[33:48.82]Who gives a shit?
[33:49.52]Let's just go.
[33:50.30]Let's just go.
[33:51.04]Let's all shine the light of the ghost's face at the same time and burn them.
[33:57.95]The power of Christ compels you.
[34:03.61]Hey, welcome to the stream, everybody.
[34:04.65]This is, uh, we're gonna be playing some... I don't know the name of the game.
[34:07.91]I forgot it already.
[34:14.35]My mic is really loud.
[34:15.29]No, I'm aware.
[34:16.29]Chat, how do I change the volume of the mic?
[34:20.50]Oh yeah, where do we do that?
[34:22.10]Press... I think... I guess, options?
[34:25.78]Yeah, you just press B in the index.
[34:28.90]B?
[34:30.41]Oh, I see it.
[34:30.97]Options.
[34:33.99]Oh, no, guys, you can turn me down.
[34:35.55]I can't turn you down.
[34:36.97]Yeah, turn me down.
[34:38.49]I'm going to talk normal.
[34:39.37]Blah, blah, blah.
[34:40.23]Today I had rice for breakfast.
[34:44.21]You hit B on the, well, I don't know.
[34:46.45]Do you have an index?
[34:48.37]Here we go.
[34:48.83]Yeah, I don't have VR.
[34:51.07]Yeah, that's right.
[34:51.49]You don't have VR.
[34:53.03]I guess I'm not going to change anything.
[34:54.55]I might turn up Vinny.
[34:55.69]No, I can't.
[34:56.91]Wait, I'm gonna turn my mic off for a second.
[34:58.87]Tell me if the beeping stops.
[35:03.49]Yeah, it stopped.
[35:11.75]Vinny, are you sure your house is not on fire?
[35:17.74]Yeah, Vinny, is your house on fire, bro?
[35:19.68]Like, what is this?
[35:21.22]No.
[35:22.88]No, I'm good.
[35:23.50]What the fuck that is?
[35:28.24]Uh, it's the in-game mic.
[35:30.68]I'm reading chat.
[35:32.06]Give me a minute here.
[35:33.32]Let me try something.
[35:33.94]Tell me if it... Tell me if this fixes anything.
[35:41.25]Vinny has a condition, yeah.
[35:45.11]He's in a constant state of alert.
[35:47.67]Does this fix it?
[35:50.10]No, we're still here.
[35:52.04]No.
[35:52.70]I wonder what that is.
[35:53.44]It's still going.
[35:59.11]Um, please disable plugins.
[36:02.19]What is, uh... I mean, it's fine, honestly.
[36:05.51]It's not bothering me.
[36:06.39]Yeah, it's pretty quiet now.
[36:08.69]I've turned you down a bit, but I can still hear your voice.
[36:11.43]No, I'm gonna keep it on.
[36:12.31]I think it's awesome.
[36:13.25]Haunted bike.
[36:17.17]Pretty scary.
[36:20.24]Uh, hello?
[36:21.90]Okay.
[36:23.76]Um, sounds like mic issues.
[36:25.08]There's a buzz in the background of your audio for some reason.
[36:27.52]No, that's the in-game thing.
[36:28.80]You're running an index through your DAW.
[36:31.92]It's the clock.
[36:32.76]That's only for chat.
[36:34.02]I just turned my DAW off and it's still happening.
[36:39.74]This is so much better than before.
[36:42.73]Yeah.
[36:45.17]Yeah, this is the weirdest fucking problem ever.
[36:47.74]Do you have another mic?
[36:48.88]No, it's not that easy because headset.
[36:50.68]Alright, I give up.
[36:51.74]Let's just, uh, you wanna find some ghosts?
[36:54.31]Yeah, it's fine, dude.
[36:54.97]Let's find some ghosts.
[36:56.99]You're just like a bat using sonar, dude.
[36:58.67]You're gonna be fine.
[36:59.93]It's such an interesting, bizarre, strange problem.
[37:02.75]That's, like, hilariously strange.
[37:05.51]Yeah.
[37:06.83]Alright, everyone grab a flashlight.
[37:10.67]Okay, uh, is there, like, a camera?
[37:13.97]Yeah, sorry.
[37:14.49]Oh, by the way, I learned this.
[37:16.13]Oh, you got the camera.
[37:16.83]There's two, though.
[37:17.47]Where's the other one?
[37:18.89]Oh, I have the other one.
[37:20.93]Oh, you got the other one.
[37:21.71]Okay, cool, cool, cool.
[37:22.53]Then in that case, I will go naked.
[37:25.13]Um, that one... What is this book for?
[37:27.11]Because we've got the journal in our head.
[37:28.75]This is the one where the ghosts write in.
[37:31.29]Oh, the ghosts write in that.
[37:32.79]Yeah.
[37:34.54]Ghost writers.
[37:36.78]Alright, so all open the door, then.
[37:40.45]Am I still the default player character?
[37:43.08]No, you're the shaggy guy.
[37:44.40]Handsome Caucasian man with blue eyes and brown hair.
[37:47.36]Yeah, my character choice didn't seem to take, but that's okay.
[37:52.16]All right, so... Oh, really?
[37:57.08]Oh, that makes sense.
[37:59.24]What did it say the ghost was?
[38:00.62]Wait, do you have all the flashlights?
[38:04.37]Yeah.
[38:05.38]Yeah, I don't have a flashlight.
[38:06.48]How did I... Wait, you do.
[38:08.58]There's a tiny flashlight and there's a big flashlight.
[38:10.80]You have the big flashlight.
[38:12.80]Who's this?
[38:13.20]Oh, this is me.
[38:14.08]That's Jerma.
[38:14.92]That's Jerma.
[38:15.54]Are you alright?
[38:18.09]Yeah, I just knocked my helmet.
[38:20.29]Oh, it sounded like you.
[38:21.39]Are you okay?
[38:22.23]Are you okay, baby?
[38:22.83]I'm fine.
[38:23.63]Okay.
[38:24.31]Wait, you can put stuff on your belt, right?
[38:26.61]Yeah, just like that other game.
[38:28.86]Did anybody get the key?
[38:29.78]Dungeon Knight.
[38:31.22]Oh, was there a key?
[38:31.94]Oh, we got the key?
[38:33.06]Yeah, I grabbed it.
[38:35.03]Yo, anybody home?
[38:36.79]There's another person in the house?
[38:38.67]Wait, did I just see something floating?
[38:41.34]So, okay, I know how to do this.
[38:46.76]Uh, who has the... the thing that lights up, the ping-ping, green... I got, I think I do.
[38:53.11]This is it, right?
[38:53.91]Oh, was I supposed to bring that?
[38:55.17]Yeah, so... I got it.
[38:56.83]I'm holding a dinner plate.
[38:58.89]Wait, guys, I think there was actually another thing.
[39:00.73]Who got the white thing?
[39:02.77]I do.
[39:03.72]You got the white thing.
[39:04.44]This is the EMF, yeah.
[39:06.36]Okay, I've got a dinner plate.
[39:09.03]So we just walk around.
[39:09.83]So we follow Viwi to start.
[39:11.09]You smash that over somebody's head?
[39:14.11]I mean, I'm thinking about it.
[39:15.10]It's kind of sidetracked.
[39:19.86]Yeah, let's wait until we see the ghost to smash any dinner plates.
[39:22.60]Burglar alarm.
[39:24.85]Okay, so Kiwi, I guess we'll follow you.
[39:27.57]When you get activity, let us know, and then we'll set the book down and we'll ask spooky questions.
[39:32.07]Okay.
[39:32.45]Oh, yeah, I like the sound of that.
[39:34.27]How do I turn on my flashlight?
[39:35.43]Because it's pretty dark for me.
[39:36.45]Oh, you use the trigger, the right trigger.
[39:38.67]Is there a certain room, right?
[39:40.18]You've got a flashlight on your shoulder.
[39:41.70]How did you do that?
[39:42.96]It's not illuminating.
[39:44.24]It doesn't illuminate anything.
[39:47.26]How did you guys turn that on?
[39:48.46]I don't have anything.
[39:49.12]I'll follow whoever has the flashlight.
[39:51.16]I don't have anything.
[39:52.26]How did you guys do that?
[39:53.28]It's pretty pitch dark.
[39:54.58]Where's the ghost?
[39:57.18]So, Kiwi will lead us to the ghost.
[39:59.37]Oh, okay.
[40:01.07]Using the PP.
[40:03.79]Using the PP?
[40:04.39]What about the PP?
[40:07.17]The PPV?
[40:09.57]It's like a device that detects ghost activity.
[40:14.47]I want you to smudge stick.
[40:16.73]Okay.
[40:17.99]Okay.
[40:19.99]I have the camera, by the way, if we want to set it up in one of these rooms.
[40:23.25]I think we should find some paranormal activity before we set the camera down.
[40:29.33]Hello?
[40:30.45]Is there anybody here?
[40:31.47]Is there anybody here?
[40:34.41]Oh, shit.
[40:35.01]What was that noise?
[40:36.10]I guess my flashlight just went out on its own.
[40:39.18]I think that's a sign.
[40:41.40]Wait, did it respond?
[40:43.93]Is anybody here?
[40:45.71]Hello?
[40:47.47]What is your name?
[40:49.61]Can you give us a sign?
[40:51.33]Can you give us a sign?
[40:52.68]What data center are you mining this from, developers?
[40:57.66]What are you going to do with our recording?
[40:59.04]Oh, Jesus, Vinny.
[41:00.22]Sorry.
[41:01.24]It's okay, Vinny.
[41:02.54]Oh, what room is this?
[41:03.76]This is the bathroom.
[41:05.15]Guys, we don't have a reflection.
[41:07.13]That's Vinny.
[41:08.61]This is the spirit box.
[41:10.39]Guys, I'm going to wash the dishes.
[41:12.81]Wash the dishes.
[41:15.61]Oh, God, what's going on?
[41:16.89]You're in the wall.
[41:18.19]Traditionally, you're not supposed to wash dishes in the bathroom.
[41:21.65]I think I went through the wall.
[41:23.13]That's fucking weird.
[41:24.21]Can you return to us?
[41:26.75]Uh, guys?
[41:28.07]I don't know.
[41:28.77]Where are you?
[41:29.55]Wait, did you actually just- I have like- Oh, that was just teeth!
[41:33.41]That was scarier than a ghost I saw inside of his brain.
[41:37.80]What is going on?
[41:38.54]I think I've teleported.
[41:40.44]Is there anybody here?
[41:42.35]Guys, can someone come get me?
[41:43.51]I'm a little scared.
[41:44.79]Where are you?
[41:45.23]Give us a sign.
[41:46.63]I'm downstairs.
[41:48.21]We might have a ghost downstairs and not upstairs.
[41:50.51]We can just turn the lights on, guys.
[41:52.23]What the hell are we doing?
[41:53.09]Guys, I'm downstairs.
[41:54.21]Oh, what?
[41:54.79]Well, the ghost won't talk to us.
[41:56.21]Oh, can you guys come find me?
[41:58.03]Is there anybody in this room?
[41:59.71]Oh, that's helpful.
[42:01.23]That's actually really nice.
[42:01.99]Guys, I went through a wall.
[42:02.59]I think I'm the ghost.
[42:04.17]I think Ross is dead.
[42:05.73]Ross, if you can hear me, let me know.
[42:07.39]Ross, are you dead?
[42:08.45]You can die?
[42:11.90]Am I dead?
[42:12.50]Did someone...
[42:16.17]What is that noise?
[42:17.39]Maybe.
[42:17.75]Oh, that's the spirit box.
[42:19.71]I'm going to try to clip through the wall to find you.
[42:22.96]Somebody stays.
[42:23.68]I got a video camera from what I read in the tutorial.
[42:27.68]Oh, wait.
[42:28.02]Put the camera down in the room.
[42:29.66]Somebody checks the TV.
[42:30.78]My blacklight has found some schmutz on this mirror.
[42:34.00]Oh, there is.
[42:34.50]I'm just going to curl up into a ball on the floor and just scream.
[42:38.11]At least it does light up.
[42:42.35]Oh, God.
[42:42.51]I want to go find him.
[42:44.55]A little bit.
[42:45.59]I got an idea.
[42:46.47]I'm going to put this camera down right here.
[42:47.86]Check this out.
[42:49.06]If you can hear me, let me know.
[42:50.14]I'm going to put the camera right here.
[42:51.94]Guys, we have five minutes.
[42:53.52]We have five minutes before this.
[42:54.79]You have five minutes?
[42:56.61]Can you guys come find me?
[42:57.63]I'm scared.
[42:58.39]I'm alone.
[42:59.59]Well, maybe you should have not split from the group.
[43:02.99]I knew I went through a wall!
[43:04.59]Can anybody get in the truck and look at the TV?
[43:06.23]Turn this off.
[43:08.07]I got a camera in here.
[43:09.94]But we don't know.
[43:10.92]We gotta find the room where... I'm stuck.
[43:13.42]We gotta find the room where the ghosts... So, Kiwi, your meter should light up.
[43:19.06]It hasn't lit up.
[43:19.92]Hold B for walkie-talkie?
[43:21.44]Can you guys hear me?
[43:22.73]Hold B and talk.
[43:34.09]Yeah.
[43:34.63]Oh, B?
[43:36.81]It's a walkie-talkie.
[43:37.49]Ross, can you hear us, Ross?
[43:41.63]Ross, hello?
[43:43.77]Ross?
[43:48.89]Where are you?
[43:50.11]Oh, I lost the flashlight.
[43:53.19]What is this game?
[43:56.19]I'm going to turn on the light.
[43:57.03]Ross, can you hear me?
[43:59.57]On the walkie-talkie.
[44:00.89]Go look at the TV in the truck.
[44:07.13]I set up a camera.
[44:08.15]Put on night vision.
[44:08.85]See if there's anything in there.
[44:12.71]Yeah, look for orbs.
[44:14.13]Wait, how are you guys using the walkie-talkie?
[44:16.41]Uh, hold B. Is this walkie-talkie?
[44:20.36]Is this walkie-talkie?
[44:21.60]Yeah, that sounds like it.
[44:23.90]Okay.
[44:25.88]Ross, can you hear me?
[44:27.64]We can just hear him in the truck talking.
[44:29.96]So, Ross, if you want to talk to us through the walkie-talkie, here's what you do.
[44:33.45]Reach over your left shoulder and pull the trigger.
[44:39.38]When you hear your neighbor, like, talking through the wall in an apartment.
[44:43.70]Reach over your left shoulder and pull the trigger.
[44:47.28]Can you guys hear me?
[44:49.00]Yes, Ross.
[44:50.16]Okay, all right, all right.
[44:51.34]I'm turning on the... I see the front... I don't think this is the right camera.
[44:56.76]Hold on, let me change camera.
[44:58.22]Okay, now I see a bedroom.
[45:00.56]That's... Yeah, I set the camera up in there.
[45:03.60]Yeah, all right.
[45:04.24]I see the two pillows.
[45:06.14]They look...
[45:07.55]Freshly bought from Ikea.
[45:09.19]I see a picture on the wall.
[45:11.47]I don't see anything spooky.
[45:14.85]What's the timer say in the truck?
[45:16.45]Like how much time do we have?
[45:18.28]Yeah, there's no time left.
[45:21.86]No, I mean no time left.
[45:24.08]Yeah, you pissed off the ghost.
[45:25.96]We either haul ass or we have to find the ghost now.
[45:29.56]I think we may have did this out of order.
[45:35.09]We gotta go downstairs.
[45:37.77]Alright, let's go.
[45:41.51]Ghost, are you here?
[45:45.47]Give us a sign.
[45:46.33]Guys, I was gonna go to Starbucks.
[45:49.11]What does everybody want?
[45:53.96]I think they have pumpkin spice right now.
[45:55.98]I'll take a venti mocha loco chino.
[45:57.90]Give me a sign.
[45:58.60]I'll just have an americano.
[46:02.26]You're gonna use the radio, I don't hear you.
[46:04.92]I'll have an Americano.
[46:07.50]You cut off too early.
[46:08.34]I didn't hear your order.
[46:09.40]They do the Harry Potter drinks if you ask nicely.
[46:16.39]The right person is there.
[46:19.11]Yeah.
[46:20.93]Okay, make noise.
[46:22.05]Ghost, are you here?
[46:24.41]We have a ghost.
[46:26.39]Give us a sign.
[46:35.94]Uh, the readings, uh, okay, so the total activity, uh, right now.
[46:43.44]I lost our blacklight.
[46:44.82]Hey, where are you going?
[46:45.54]I hear some noises.
[46:46.40]I hear it too.
[46:48.89]Where are you?
[46:51.83]I'm upstairs.
[46:52.43]That was me.
[46:54.73]Okay, so, uh, I'm looking at your setting, uh, I'm pretty sane and cool.
[46:59.77]Uh, can you wait?
[47:00.69]No.
[47:08.07]Something's in this fucking house, dude.
[47:09.29]Something's in this house.
[47:11.57]My name is not important to you.
[47:15.49]Wait, he said something, but I couldn't hear him over Ross.
[47:23.51]What'd he say?
[47:24.15]Okay.
[47:24.27]Where are you?
[47:24.87]I'm in the truck.
[47:25.51]Not you, Ross.
[47:41.94]Where are you guys?
[47:42.72]Where is everybody?
[47:44.42]Where are you guys at?
[48:03.35]We're gonna go see Mr. Plinkett?
[48:06.23]That's a YouTuber, don't worry about it.
[48:08.26]Ah, fuck, I don't know.
[48:09.36]Wait, is somebody a YouTuber?
[48:11.02]It's a good joke.
[48:12.78]May I?
[48:13.86]Or you can point down... Are there any ghosts in here?
[48:17.00]Hello?
[48:18.34]I don't think those usually have a name, though.
[48:21.28]Spooky Spockers?
[48:22.52]Do we hear that?
[48:23.82]Hello?
[48:25.70]Is there spooky ghosts in here?
[48:27.50]How...
[48:29.06]How old are you?
[48:33.02]Phant... Phantasmal Spirit.
[48:34.98]ASL.
[48:35.30]Find the... We gotta find the, um, the light switch so we don't... Give us a sign.
[48:41.77]Give us a sign, you're the piano man.
[48:48.53]Guys, uh... He chimes in.
[48:50.77]I'm not really sure how it goes.
[48:53.50]Oh shit, I've been caught!
[48:54.40]I don't know where I am.
[48:57.42]She died.
[48:58.08]Guys.
[48:59.56]What is this button?
[49:01.94]Guys, I found a button and it just made it go green.
[49:04.92]Wow.
[49:05.66]What do you need my flashlight for, Vinny?
[49:09.60]Who made PT on floor?
[49:11.00]Kiwi, was it you?
[49:13.46]I'm a little scared.
[49:14.37]I'm going to level with you.
[49:15.79]Green button fog.
[49:17.59]It's been green this whole time.
[49:19.93]I don't know if I'm using it wrong, but so far, nothing.
[49:23.77]I think he might be in the kitchen, guys.
[49:26.30]You're supposed to say ghost's name.
[49:28.18]It's limited.
[49:29.04]It's written on the wall in the, uh... Guys.
[49:32.04]Oh, we didn't learn his name.
[49:32.98]That was rude.
[49:33.50]Guys, why does the manual say a survivor's guide?
[49:35.98]Is there a chance we could die?
[49:37.84]This ghost isn't killing us or anything.
[49:41.68]Oh.
[49:42.70]Hey, this ghost sucks.
[49:44.08]Here I am, just walking around by myself in the fucking basement.
[49:50.94]This ghost is a piece of shit.
[49:56.37]That's good.
[49:57.21]Pretty lame ghost.
[49:58.59]Are you recording from your perspective?
[50:00.43]I am recording from my perspective.
[50:01.65]Oh, very good.
[50:02.71]I bet Noah loves that.
[50:04.77]Yeah, he's going to really like all the extra footage.
[50:06.41]All of a sudden, my neck just goes.
[50:07.73]He really will.
[50:09.97]It's Noah's favorite.
[50:10.67]The air conditioning in this place must be really loud.
[50:12.75]It gets so much louder when you step in.
[50:15.05]They shouldn't be running AC in a dead person's house.
[50:17.39]There's no one living here.
[50:18.99]I have information.
[50:20.69]Info?
[50:21.43]What's your info?
[50:22.80]What's your information, Vinny?
[50:25.27]It says the name's Steven Johnson, and this ghost seems to only respond to people who are alone.
[50:30.90]You should be able to use its name to anger it and get some paranormal activity.
[50:34.98]Alone.
[50:36.56]Who's got the biggest balls amongst us?
[50:38.64]It's not me.
[50:39.75]Not me.
[50:40.35]Shotgun, not me.
[50:41.27]Me.
[50:41.75]Oh, me.
[50:42.05]Me, me, me.
[50:42.85]Over.
[50:43.07]Do you want to bring the camera so I can watch from the car?
[50:48.37]I mean, the truck?
[50:48.95]Yeah, we should get it.
[50:52.37]I think the camera's in the bedroom?
[50:54.65]Camera's in the bedroom.
[50:56.79]Oh, are we insane?
[50:59.05]In the membrane?
[51:00.65]And crazy?
[51:01.94]And insane at the brain!
[51:03.16]Am I gonna get jumped?
[51:06.20]Uh, how would we know if it was cold?
[51:11.06]I can't see Dick right now, yeah.
[51:13.58]Where's the table?
[51:14.72]What was his name again?
[51:16.56]Uh, Johnson.
[51:17.86]Steven.
[51:18.24]Steven Johnson.
[51:19.40]Steven Johnson.
[51:23.85]Steven Johnson, I know you're here.
[51:30.51]Steven Johnson, I know you're here.
[51:42.94]I think somebody scammed us.
[51:45.76]They just went on vacation and told us the place was haunted and we had to pay like 10 grand to do this.
[51:52.95]Yeah, I I forgot where the bedroom was it's pretty large house over I think it's upstairs It's too dark to see what the hell's going on in this house anymore, so I think the ghost cut the power
[52:22.55]I'm stuck behind a couch.
[52:23.63]You can turn the power back on in the breaker box in the basement.
[52:26.55]There's a red light.
[52:27.51]You poke it, and then all the lights will come back on.
[52:29.23]I got the camera.
[52:31.93]Do we have a flashlight?
[52:34.02]Person?
[52:35.38]We probably need a flashlight for that.
[52:37.52]I got a camera.
[52:39.26]Are you able to turn the camera back on so I can watch remotely?
[52:42.50]Yes, I will turn it on.
[52:43.42]Can you see?
[52:50.04]I can't even see where I'm going here.
[52:55.37]Roger, I can see.
[52:56.77]Over.
[52:58.60]Oh, I can do a camera light.
[53:06.20]Okay, I got the camera.
[53:07.72]Where do you want me to go?
[53:09.60]Where's the guy with the big balls supposed to go?
[53:11.64]I think we beeped it and should probably restart.
[53:20.01]Over.
[53:20.23]Uh, guys?
[53:21.75]The fucking door locks.
[53:24.60]I hear somebody walking.
[53:25.30]No!
[53:25.54]I hate this.
[53:30.84]What's the guy's name again?
[53:32.49]I don't know what else.
[53:33.05]Steven Johnson.
[53:33.59]Steven Johnson's behind me.
[53:34.31]Steven Johnson's behind me.
[53:35.13]Steven Johnson's behind me.
[53:36.21]Steven Johnson's behind me.
[53:37.17]Where are you?
[53:37.71]Where are you?
[53:38.17]Where are you?
[53:38.83]I'm upstairs.
[53:39.29]Steven Johnson's probably going to kill me.
[53:40.29]I have the camera.
[53:40.73]Can you hear me?
[53:42.75]Over.
[53:43.43]I can hear you, but I think somebody's behind me.
[53:44.87]Oh, shit.
[53:45.77]I'm at five.
[53:46.11]I'm at five.
[53:46.78]I'm at five.
[53:47.32]In the living room.
[53:48.18]You said he's at 41.
[53:48.60]Jeremy, you said he's at 28.
[53:49.62]You need to get out of there.
[53:52.96]Vinny, you're at 41.
[53:55.06]I don't know where you are, ma'am, but you gotta get out of there.
[53:58.00]Your red line's real high.
[54:00.66]You're at like a 10 right now.
[54:02.72]I don't know where I am.
[54:04.20]I can't see where I am.
[54:06.68]But I am.
[54:08.51]Oh, my God!
[54:09.79]You're just sitting.
[54:11.39]It's seated Vinny.
[54:13.85]It's seated Vinny.
[54:14.81]You are a monster.
[54:17.81]I'm trying to get out of the house!
[54:20.57]Let's hightail it out of here.
[54:21.83]You're all pretty close to death.
[54:43.18]Especially Jerma.
[54:44.92]If we look at the readout here, Jerma was about to die.
[54:49.98]He's at 18%.
[54:51.38]Actually, wow, this one really hates Jerma.
[54:52.98]It's going specifically for you.
[54:54.28]I'm fine.
[54:54.88]Where are you, Jerma?
[54:56.14]Just throw me back in there and, like, just wait till I get eaten and then take a few pictures and then send it to the fucking National Geographic.
[55:01.07]You guys will be millionaires.
[55:03.53]All I ask is you build a giant statue in my name.
[55:06.61]But if a ghost takes the picture, you're gonna have a lawsuit.
[55:09.79]So we can use some of the evidence that we found already.
[55:13.00]Yeah, what do we have?
[55:14.96]Because this thing going to five means that it's, that limits it.
[55:20.11]Oh, okay.
[55:20.95]So do we have evidence?
[55:24.03]So EMF level five is considered evidence.
[55:27.42]So we can put that in.
[55:33.15]Did the spirit box go off at any point, Vinny?
[55:36.00]Not once, no.
[55:37.30]Okay.
[55:38.12]Okay.
[55:40.50]Did anyone see any fingerprints?
[55:41.90]I don't think bathroom mirror schmutz counts.
[55:44.44]No.
[55:46.08]Oh, shit.
[55:46.84]No one saw... Did you see a ghost orb on any cameras, Ross?
[55:51.55]No, I didn't see a ghost orb.
[55:53.57]Alright, no orbs.
[55:55.51]Did anyone see any ghost writing in the ghost book?
[55:58.89]I don't think there was any writing.
[56:01.06]All right, let's bring the ghost book in there and the... Did anyone see their breath or have freezing temperatures happen?
[56:07.76]No, I didn't have freezing breath this time.
[56:10.94]Okay, so... Well, who's got the highest sanity?
[56:15.83]Oh, it's me because I'm scared.
[56:20.09]Where is the ghost book?
[56:20.93]What happened to it?
[56:23.35]Uh, I don't know.
[56:24.96]Is anyone moving the camera?
[56:26.90]Oh, it's here.
[56:27.42]Vinny has it on his... I got the camera right here.
[56:31.98]Why does Vinny sound so muffled now?
[56:33.52]Does anyone else hear this?
[56:37.23]Yeah.
[56:38.21]Yeah, I got the video.
[56:39.57]This is a video camera.
[56:40.55]There's nothing written in that book.
[56:42.41]Your voice is really muffled.
[56:44.11]Yours is too.
[56:45.98]Really?
[56:46.64]Must be an audio bug then.
[56:49.30]Jerma, what room were you in when your sanity was going down like crazy and you saw What's-His-Face?
[56:54.78]I don't even know.
[56:55.42]I might just be, like, placebo affecting myself.
[56:57.59]I thought I saw a guy on my left when I was walking in the hallway upstairs.
[57:01.19]Well, your sanity was the lowest, so it would make sense.
[57:04.73]Yeah, did we see it?
[57:05.31]Was there a guy on the left side of the screen?
[57:07.21]Jerma, can you hear me?
[57:08.41]I didn't see a guy, but I was downstairs.
[57:11.00]Jerma, I need the flashlight.
[57:12.86]I'm going in.
[57:13.75]You going in?
[57:15.33]You going in?
[57:16.57]You gonna bring the diary?
[57:18.19]There's a bathroom.
[57:20.85]Check the bathroom.
[57:21.63]Check the upstairs bathroom, Vinny.
[57:24.39]Give me the camera.
[57:25.37]I'm gonna take the camera.
[57:26.37]You got the camera?
[57:28.73]All alone?
[57:30.05]Yeah, you can watch the camera.
[57:31.55]He doesn't respond to people who, you know, who's got the other camera, not that one.
[57:37.30]Oh, that's the still camera.
[57:38.55]This is the money camera.
[57:40.43]We get money for taking snapshots.
[57:42.69]Ross, I see you took a selfie on it.
[57:45.35]The video camera?
[57:46.43]I got it.
[57:47.07]Was that me?
[57:47.71]Oh, right.
[57:48.13]You're on VR.
[57:48.69]I forgot.
[57:49.07]Sorry.
[57:49.23]You got it all?
[57:50.17]What about the camera?
[58:00.71]I think he's got it.
[58:02.21]Unless someone wants to go in with the snapshot camera and take some snappies.
[58:05.92]No, I'm good.
[58:06.86]I don't want to do that.
[58:07.84]I'll take it.
[58:08.84]Alright, do it.
[58:10.48]The more snapshots you get of ghosts, the more money we get.
[58:13.30]Oh, shit.
[58:13.88]There's no more film in that camera, Roger.
[58:16.93]I snapped all the photos, Roger.
[58:19.01]There's no more film?
[58:20.11]Oh, well, shit.
[58:21.15]Wait, dude, do you have the camera on right now?
[58:24.21]Yeah, right click.
[58:25.07]Oh, no, you're on VR.
[58:26.17]You're in the fun mode.
[58:27.13]Yeah, yeah.
[58:28.76]Okay, yeah, Vinny, Vinny, uh, we see, we see you.
[58:32.60]You need to use the walkie-talkie over, roger.
[58:34.88]Oh, sorry, Vinny, we see you.
[58:47.10]Should we fuck with him?
[58:54.88]Vinny, you left the camera on the counter.
[59:00.69]Take that into the upstairs bathroom.
[59:02.32]Yeah, you might want to bring that with you, dude.
[59:03.90]Bring us with you.
[59:06.88]Yeah, you can have the flashlight at the same time, but it blinks.
[59:14.25]Oh, we're all just total fucking wusses here, huh?
[59:17.23]Yeah, we're bitches.
[59:18.21]Hey, Vinny, go that way!
[59:22.29]Vinny, you dropped the camera?
[59:24.05]Is he dead?
[59:25.88]Vinny, oh no.
[59:27.18]Wait, are you dead?
[59:27.78]Is he dead?
[59:29.32]Dude, he's dead.
[59:30.84]Look at his sanity.
[59:32.60]He's fucking dead.
[59:35.34]That's why he dropped.
[59:36.96]Okay, let's make an educated guess because I don't really want to... No, coward.
[59:41.26]I'm going to go hit him in the head with a radio.
[59:43.46]Are you hearing the radio?
[59:44.32]It's going berserk right now.
[59:45.46]I'm getting this horrible, scary noise.
[59:50.29]Is that actually real?
[59:52.27]Is that the game?
[59:53.75]Uh, not for me.
[59:56.17]Oh, yeah, now I hear it.
[59:57.26]It's, uh, it's Jerma.
[59:58.24]Oh, it's Mai.
[59:58.80]It's me.
[60:00.28]So, wait, he just died in there?
[60:02.50]He's fucking dead.
[60:03.88]He's dead.
[60:04.32]Alright, where's the camera?
[60:06.44]Watch.
[60:07.72]You keep watching.
[60:08.32]I'm gonna open up the... I'm gonna run in and run out.
[60:12.21]This is my job.
[60:12.95]Alright, I wanna be in communication the whole time.
[60:19.20]Yeah, I think it's right in the front door, right?
[60:29.26]Alright.
[60:36.01]It's pitch black in here.
[60:38.03]Alright, I'm in constant communication with you.
[60:43.97]Do you see me on the- on the- I need a flip of light.
[60:47.69]That'll give us some sanity.
[60:50.54]Oh, shit.
[60:51.20]I'm in a dream.
[60:51.74]This is how you tell you're in a dream.
[60:53.36]When you flip a light switch and it doesn't work.
[60:54.80]When you flip a light switch and it doesn't work, that's how you can tell you're dreaming.
[60:57.36]That's how you start lucid dreaming.
[61:00.32]Yeah, uh, I think that's true.
[61:02.46]I think actually... Yeah.
[61:09.02]Uh, I think he's dropping really fast.
[61:10.38]Jeremy, you're at 14%, dude.
[61:11.30]Alright.
[61:14.25]I hear gas.
[61:19.96]Can I leave?
[61:20.42]Maybe you should leave, dude.
[61:26.11]You're nearing 10%.
[61:28.97]Oh, okay.
[61:29.43]I found the door.
[61:29.99]You come to the front door.
[61:33.13]Yo, do you have the ghost book?
[61:39.45]Uh, no.
[61:39.95]I got the ghost radio.
[61:43.37]Okay, that one's kind of tricky, I think.
[61:47.49]Vinny's ghost was behind you?
[61:49.19]Hey, ghost!
[61:51.31]Fuck you!
[61:51.87]Wait, is Vinny still in the game?
[61:54.31]Uh, he's probably muted.
[61:56.25]Yeah, he walks around as a spirit.
[61:57.77]He's a ghost.
[61:58.27]He does?
[61:58.85]Oh, really?
[61:59.45]Yeah, yeah, he's a ghost now.
[62:01.25]Vinny, show us where the flashlight is, man.
[62:06.59]Everyone just stay back to back to back.
[62:08.61]Like the Spartans did.
[62:09.49]Sanity goes down in the dark.
[62:10.81]I am a scaredy cat.
[62:11.77]I'm more than happy to admit that.
[62:13.67]So apparently Sanity will go down in the dark.
[62:16.08]Where are we going?
[62:17.51]We gotta snap a piccy.
[62:18.95]Ross, get to the camera.
[62:20.77]What, is it down here?
[62:21.63]There's something on the ground.
[62:23.13]Guys, I found it!
[62:24.27]There's a flashlight up here too.
[62:25.11]Oh, I got the camera.
[62:28.47]Is it on?
[62:29.27]Bring it in.
[62:29.89]Jerma, I got the camera.
[62:32.21]Over.
[62:32.87]I'm at the front door.
[62:33.51]Do you want it?
[62:34.63]Jerma, where you at?
[62:36.82]Jerma?
[62:37.20]I think Jerma's dead.
[62:38.02]No, no, I'm good.
[62:39.32]I have like the wicked shitty from Walmart thing you plug in on Halloween that does the cool thing outside shining on the front of your house.
[62:47.05]I'm about to die?
[62:47.91]None of the lights work.
[62:49.01]Hey, something's coming through the radio.
[63:15.41]In bedroom one.
[63:16.17]Something's coming through the radio in bedroom one.
[63:26.34]It's... It's saying... It's saying, um... I think it was the weather.
[63:34.64]I really think it was the weather.
[63:35.82]It was like sunny out.
[63:38.23]Can you hear me?
[63:44.15]Yeah, you might want to get out here at 1%.
[63:49.43]No, he's not.
[63:50.19]He says 2%.
[63:50.69]I'm good, man.
[63:51.55]I have 1%.
[63:52.41]I can live.
[63:55.63]Power through.
[63:56.33]There's a car over here.
[63:57.47]Yeah, but he's bouncing back from zero.
[63:59.44]He keeps surviving.
[64:01.86]I'm good, man.
[64:07.62]Alright, I'm coming back down.
[64:12.20]There's a ghost...
[64:15.70]I found Vinny.
[64:16.20]I found Vinny's dead body.
[64:22.78]Hey.
[64:23.90]Oh, you found the blacklight.
[64:25.22]Yeah, I'm... I'm good.
[64:28.71]Nice.
[64:28.89]Did you find any fingerprints or anything like that?
[64:31.19]Yeah, they're everywhere.
[64:32.21]They're all over the place upstairs.
[64:34.39]Wait, for real?
[64:34.79]Oh, so there's... For real?
[64:35.97]Yeah, I mean, like, seriously, they're all over the door handles and everything, yeah.
[64:38.57]Oh, shit, yeah.
[64:39.29]Oh, great, great, great.
[64:40.43]We can probably guess from that.
[64:42.94]Come on, let's get in the truck.
[64:44.64]Let's get in the truck.
[64:48.02]So which one said we needed to... He has massive plot armor?
[65:01.10]So our other evidence is... Fingerprints.
[65:04.88]Fingerprints all over the door handles.
[65:07.24]And we also got the spirit box to work as well, right?
[65:11.38]Like it did some noise.
[65:13.28]The radio was freaking out up there too.
[65:17.07]So, did it talk?
[65:19.13]We didn't see any writing.
[65:21.01]Oh, no writing or anything.
[65:21.99]I think we got spirit box.
[65:23.79]Let's give it a shot.
[65:25.33]Yeah, let's give it a try.
[65:26.19]It says not discovered.
[65:32.94]Yeah, put in EMF 5 fingerprints, spirit box, and it's not giving me anything.
[65:38.32]Ghost type.
[65:41.06]What about Banshee?
[65:43.70]Well, we don't have a cross, so we weren't able to test that.
[65:48.93]Yeah, Banshee needs to, we need to have a crucifix, but we need to buy one of those, I think.
[65:53.15]Spirit buggy, yeah, nothing there.
[65:57.57]Fingerprints.
[65:58.51]What about a revenant?
[66:00.87]Revenant?
[66:01.85]What's a revenant?
[66:03.41]Ghost type revenant.
[66:04.17]Let's look into it.
[66:04.89]Let's have a look.
[66:09.53]Remember, you're an overconfident, clueless guy.
[66:12.85]And I make it to the end of the movie every time.
[66:20.21]So it could be a Banshee or a Revenant.
[66:25.11]How's Vinny doing?
[66:25.83]Is he just kind of hanging out?
[66:27.43]Yeah, he must be super bored in there.
[66:29.95]Oh, it says, okay, yeah, Revenant could be EMF level 5, fingerprints, and ghost writing.
[66:34.25]But we never got ghost writing, did we?
[66:35.53]We never got ghost writing.
[66:36.39]We've got to put ghost writing in the right room.
[66:38.71]The room that has all the stuff.
[66:39.72]We never did that.
[66:40.40]Where were you upstairs when you almost died and you found the blacklight?
[66:47.59]In the hallway, I had all the problems in the bathroom, and then in one of the bedrooms.
[66:52.65]The bedroom has... They had the fingerprints all over the door.
[66:56.92]Alright.
[66:58.42]Okay, so he probably haunts the bedroom.
[67:01.00]We could go up there with the ghost book and see if he does anything.
[67:05.90]You gotta lock in your answers, apparently.
[67:07.52]Are we out of time, though?
[67:08.90]Like, can we even do this still?
[67:10.42]Do we all have to lock in our answers?
[67:12.04]No, we're alive, so we can do it.
[67:13.42]That time means, like, countdown until he's pissed off and starts, like, laughing and killing.
[67:16.72]That's the enrage, yes.
[67:17.41]That's the enrage timer.
[67:18.75]That's different.
[67:19.21]Yes, so, let's see.
[67:22.80]I'm lying?
[67:23.34]Why am I lying?
[67:25.10]I'm not lying.
[67:25.74]There was the ghost goo all over the handle to the bedroom.
[67:29.64]Oh, guys, apparently we all have to individually lock down our own answers.
[67:34.00]So what was the first one?
[67:35.72]Can I copy your homework?
[67:36.72]Evidence found was EMF level 5, right?
[67:39.14]EMF level 5, yeah.
[67:40.22]And the second one we found was fingerprints.
[67:43.47]We didn't have a third one.
[67:44.87]Fingerprints 2.
[67:48.43]Fingerprints number 2.
[67:50.44]Oh, but the spirit box did go off, right?
[67:52.70]I put a trigger for this twice.
[67:56.36]But you said that you heard the spirit box radio go off, right?
[68:00.01]Yeah, it was going like...
[68:03.45]okay that sounds good he was talking to us too but I don't know if that's the spirit box or if that's like an in-game thing that you hear in your ears because when I was with vinny he was like legit talking to us so I would say we can say I think vinny had the spirit box but this is not yet discovered so we but we don't don't don't we have to yeah how are you alive must be that purple power right
[68:31.79]The only thing we really have to answer?
[68:33.29]Can you walk in and answer?
[68:35.77]Test this.
[68:36.42]Do we want to guess?
[68:38.92]Yeah, I think we should guess.
[68:39.84]I think that Revenant is pretty close.
[68:41.86]Let's try Revenant.
[68:43.04]That was our first game.
[68:43.88]Yeah, let's just fucking guess.
[68:45.62]We don't know what we're doing yet.
[68:46.44]Let's get Vinny back in here.
[68:47.54]I agree.
[68:47.74]I'm guessing Revenant, but we haven't got Ghost Riding.
[68:51.03]I'm sure if we brought the book up, we might get that.
[68:53.09]EMF level 5 Ghost Orb.
[68:54.17]No, we never have Ghost Orb.
[68:56.57]Uh...
[68:58.59]You got a bunch of crazy ghost shit on this camera?
[69:00.27]Yeah.
[69:00.69]Leave it for some old lady in the neighborhood to fucking find it.
[69:03.01]Oh, we never got freezing temperatures from a- so it can't be a banshee.
[69:07.12]Uh, yeah, we wouldn't know how to test for that anyway.
[69:09.14]Let's go revenant.
[69:09.68]You missed level 5.
[69:10.44]We're not- the freezing temperatures- freezing temperatures is your breath.
[69:13.92]I'm going revenant.
[69:14.70]Yeah, I'm going revenant too.
[69:16.22]Okay, wait, so how do you lock in your- your answer?
[69:18.46]We just close the door?
[69:19.02]The last page you put in.
[69:20.74]But it won't let me- Oh, yeah.
[69:21.66]It won't- it won't let me do that.
[69:23.72]Maybe if we all guess something else, we're different.
[69:26.74]Oh.
[69:28.18]Guys, how do you... I'm clicking it and it won't... It's fine.
[69:32.36]Don't worry about it.
[69:33.54]Oh, you gotta do... On the evidence, you gotta make it, you gotta choose the evidence.
[69:37.82]Did we get it?
[69:40.48]Welcome back.
[69:41.30]There's some drops ready for you.
[69:43.90]Oh, you guys didn't take my body?
[69:46.14]You got 20 bucks?
[69:47.72]Were we supposed to take your body?
[69:49.66]No, I just wanted a eulogy.
[69:52.04]Oh.
[69:52.62]Well, you... Rub-a-dub-dub.
[69:55.72]Sorry you died.
[69:58.30]Rub-a-lub-a-dub-dub.
[70:02.08]Nice.
[70:02.96]Hi, what's up?
[70:04.62]Welcome back to the land of the living.
[70:07.01]Did you win?
[70:07.69]We got that completely wrong.
[70:10.07]Cool.
[70:12.81]We got $20.
[70:15.79]What can we buy with $20?
[70:17.87]Candle.
[70:18.49]No, glow stick.
[70:20.17]Ooh.
[70:21.99]It says here... One glow stick for us all to share.
[70:24.89]Yeah, what's this?
[70:26.39]A smudge stick, right?
[70:28.98]EMF reader is $45.
[70:30.72]A flashlight is $30.
[70:32.22]We could get... Oh, guys, we could buy two lighters.
[70:34.88]Yeah, let's get some lighters.
[70:37.98]Oh, no, I can't buy any lighters.
[70:39.32]I'm hearing an echo.
[70:40.38]Is that my computer?
[70:44.00]Maybe.
[70:44.42]Am I still a fire alarm?
[70:46.52]Yeah, buddy.
[70:47.36]A little bit.
[70:49.07]No, you're not.
[70:49.83]Not anymore.
[70:50.17]Now you are.
[70:56.87]It's like proximity.
[70:58.96]So you know when you're getting near him.
[71:00.10]It's actually kind of useful.
[71:01.82]I got some smudge sticks.
[71:06.67]What are we buying?
[71:08.53]I bought two smudge sticks.
[71:09.95]Smudge sticks are good.
[71:12.43]Journal also has description of all ghost types, I've been told.
[71:16.62]Yeah, we were looking at that.
[71:17.64]Is somebody else the host of the lobby now?
[71:20.02]I can't select a job anymore.
[71:20.90]Open VR chaperone setting is what's making the noise.
[71:24.44]Open VR.
[71:25.26]What's open VR?
[71:27.57]Oh, it's because you're on the edge of your VR play space.
[71:32.77]Wait, you're sitting down on the couch away from the lighthouses and the thing is warning you that you're going to walk into the wall.
[71:39.67]But it's not warning me because I don't hear it.
[71:45.56]So it's going through the wrong audio device.
[71:47.08]Maybe you could go to advanced settings and turn that warning off.
[71:51.37]I don't even... I didn't even know that was an option.
[71:54.13]Okay, I'll turn that off.
[71:55.25]That's so weird.
[71:57.39]Like, Vinny, you're going to hit your head on the wall, Vinny!
[71:59.29]Watch out!
[72:01.47]But it tells you that I'm going to hit my head on the wall, not me.
[72:04.24]Yeah, that's so stupid.
[72:08.78]Chat, do you know how to turn that off?
[72:11.38]Wait, if I stand up, do you still hear this fire alarm?
[72:14.85]Yeah, dude.
[72:17.11]Chat, this was erroneous information.
[72:19.43]Can you walk, like, in range, like, kind of where your lighthouses are?
[72:22.13]Like, can you, like, get in the middle of it?
[72:24.11]Oh, you're, like, right in the middle of it?
[72:28.17]Right here.
[72:35.58]Move further into your play space.
[72:37.16]Any further, chat, and I'll be, like, fucking merging with my computer.
[72:41.47]guys someone told me that zero sanity doesn't kill you it makes the ghost hunt you watch activity because when it hits 10 ghosts want to kill that person yeah or kill people they start they start hunting okay uh I think we should save up for more flashlights chat I kind of like the sound I'm not even kidding it's like it's fun to me
[73:10.01]Is it gone?
[73:10.31]Yeah.
[73:11.31]No, it's not gone.
[73:12.25]It's fine, dude.
[73:13.05]It's fine.
[73:13.53]It's fine.
[73:14.59]It's a good bit.
[73:15.37]Let's just roll with it.
[73:17.21]Alright.
[73:18.07]Sounds good.
[73:20.77]We always know when you're around.
[73:21.65]Okay, did we decide on a... Did we buy something?
[73:24.57]I bought... Oh, wait.
[73:27.05]Did we share money?
[73:27.81]Uh, I sold 20 bucks.
[73:32.60]Okay, good.
[73:33.48]I bought two smudge sticks.
[73:35.10]Is that an echo, maybe... You have my stream open?
[73:40.50]No.
[73:41.74]Wow, weird.
[73:43.32]I hear my voice coming from your mic.
[73:45.98]You should turn me down then, probably.
[73:47.82]Yeah, okay.
[73:48.36]I'm going to do that when we get in.
[73:49.67]Or maybe I should turn you down.
[73:50.99]Yeah, I think you're going to have to do that when we get into the game.
[73:54.79]Remember that if you can't adapt, you're weak.
[73:56.19]You have a pretty shitty echo of me.
[74:01.81]Guys, apparently we got... Guys, people said we got $20 each.
[74:05.47]It's not for the group.
[74:07.27]I just had ten bucks.
[74:08.25]I bought a lighter.
[74:08.87]Everybody said turn off your shower.
[74:10.51]Oh, we should buy candles and smudge sticks then, because that can keep us from going insane.
[74:17.35]Really?
[74:18.43]Yeah, the candles.
[74:19.23]If you light a candle and a smudge stick in a haunted room, the ghost won't attack you in there for a little bit.
[74:25.42]If you burn sage, and also if you put powdered eggshells on the back of your neck, that also keeps spirits away in real life.
[74:33.68]Oh, in real life?
[74:35.70]Yeah.
[74:37.26]Alright, so is somebody the... Is somebody the host again?
[74:40.64]Because I can't select a job or anything.
[74:44.59]It's... Oh.
[74:47.01]Let's see.
[74:47.47]Select job.
[74:48.75]Yeah, yeah.
[74:49.32]You must be the leader.
[74:52.27]Somebody said turn off your chaperone.
[74:54.26]I think Ross... Yeah, I tried that.
[74:56.76]That's Japes.
[74:58.96]Ross just accidentally left.
[75:00.58]Oh, he did?
[75:01.68]The code's the same.
[75:05.02]He pressed leave, I think.
[75:07.00]We can just rejoin.
[75:09.44]Yeah, I think the code's the same.
[75:13.60]Ready?
[75:14.54]I'll be fair, though.
[75:15.52]I don't know if you should put leave right next to 8 pixels next to start.
[75:21.25]Agreed.
[75:21.47]That should probably be down here a little, like in the corner.
[75:23.27]Yeah, that's fair.
[75:32.18]You're sitting too.
[75:33.62]Yeah, I've, you know, I'm taking a little break between, uh... Welcome back.
[75:37.04]...between haunts.
[75:37.62]Welcome back.
[75:38.40]Can you walk forward so I can see what I look like when I walk?
[75:41.29]This is what you look like when you walk.
[75:43.11]Usually with your arms.
[75:43.71]Well, actually, your arms are like this.
[75:46.63]I do that because it's the edge of my couch.
[75:48.98]I can do that in real life.
[75:49.68]I'm just chilling.
[75:50.42]I'm just chilling.
[75:51.52]Wait, so are we not able to ready up or something?
[75:55.00]No, we're good.
[75:56.68]Yeah, I think we're good.
[75:57.30]Because I hit select job, and it kicked me out of the lobby.
[76:01.02]What, really?
[76:02.10]Yeah.
[76:03.22]Oh, it's me.
[76:04.00]I had to do it.
[76:04.77]This game is made very well.
[76:07.63]do we want to go I have a cool game actually uh maybe like a tropical um ghost that is absolutely not an option okay there's one that looks like it's sort of in the middle of the country one in sort of like the northwest and one in around la or nevada or something oh I don't know
[76:28.71]Oh guys look they keep our memories here from all the times that we failed Oh, there's the picture what why oh my god Look at the good.
[76:42.26]How did you take a German of the camera your eyeball is?
[76:46.88]It's popping out of your skull Is my okay?
[76:51.61]You don't see it.
[76:52.89]I think that's the flashlight on his shoulder.
[76:54.53]Oh
[77:02.38]Chat, you're seeing this, right?
[77:03.52]Oh, guys, we gotta ready up.
[77:04.90]Oh, ready up, ready up, ready up.
[77:07.42]Chat, you gotta take a screenshot of this so I can show them later.
[77:11.06]Yeah, let me see.
[77:11.70]His eyes is bugging out of his head.
[77:14.64]What?
[77:15.78]We have one person who is not ready.
[77:17.71]Yeah, it's Vinny, I think.
[77:20.31]I think I know who it is.
[77:21.07]Sorry.
[77:21.71]I got it.
[77:22.17]I got it.
[77:22.41]We're good.
[77:22.85]Vinny, you look like you're walking around a house in a towel that's about to fall off your waist.
[77:28.13]With, like, a whole group of people over your house.
[77:31.48]Like, oh shit, I don't know.
[77:32.44]Don't look.
[77:37.52]Oof.
[77:38.74]Alright, how do we start the job?
[77:41.86]I think we're good, right?
[77:43.51]We're good.
[77:43.87]Everyone's ready.
[77:44.57]So we just... You think you start it, Keith?
[77:46.93]Somebody has to press the start button.
[77:48.61]Let's fucking go.
[77:49.69]Let's go.
[77:51.39]Ghost time.
[77:52.05]I'm going to play the ghost game some more.
[77:54.35]I'm so fucking amped up right now.
[78:06.80]Chat, the chaperone settings definitely do not seem to be a thing.
[78:11.04]I'm just saying.
[78:11.76]Advanced settings show.
[78:12.88]Okay.
[78:13.18]I mean, 99% already.
[78:13.88]I didn't do anything.
[78:15.42]Um... I've got a candle?
[78:17.42]I think this is a candle.
[78:18.20]I've got a sponge.
[78:19.76]You've got a sponge?
[78:21.36]Oh, is that a sponge?
[78:22.52]I thought it was a candle.
[78:24.30]No, this is a blunt.
[78:25.22]Oh, dude.
[78:33.93]It looks like a blimey.
[78:34.93]Oh, baby.
[78:35.27]It looks like a bird poop.
[78:36.13]It actually- wait, it actually is?
[78:39.40]Oh, wait, shit, we shouldn't be lighting this shit.
[78:41.14]I think this is our- these are our smudge sticks.
[78:43.02]Fuck!
[78:43.82]That's the smudge sticks!
[78:44.80]I paid $15 for them!
[78:45.78]Put it out!
[78:46.46]Put it out!
[78:46.86]Put it out!
[78:47.28]Put it out!
[78:47.78]Shit, fuck.
[78:50.16]Oh, no, it- we used them full.
[78:52.77]What do we do with the stunt finder?
[78:53.97]Okay.
[78:55.21]Joseph Williams is the ghost.
[78:56.55]It looks like a pickle.
[78:57.07]Joseph Williams.
[78:57.45]Prevent the ghost from hunting with a crucifix.
[78:59.97]Ooh, do we have a crucifix?
[79:01.71]So we just wasted that, huh?
[79:04.96]Oh, it's sage.
[79:05.82]I thought it was a blunt.
[79:07.28]Yeah, it's sage.
[79:08.26]And we just use all our money to buy those.
[79:10.34]And a lighter to light them.
[79:11.88]I like to think it's in canon that Vinny's house is actually full of smoke.
[79:17.26]And he's just like, I don't care.
[79:20.55]I just want to see a drawing of Vinny playing virtual reality with the, like, this is fine dog.
[79:25.78]Yeah, exactly.
[79:26.68]Fire all around him.
[79:29.02]It's not a good place for VR, I'll tell you that much.
[79:31.62]It's not conducive, but I make do.
[79:33.95]So now this is the view of my crotch.
[79:36.81]So we'll be using this to find ghosts.
[79:39.71]Okay.
[79:40.19]It's on your belt.
[79:41.01]Can I...
[79:42.13]Do you have, who has the, uh, um, not the blunt, uh, who's got the thing that makes the thing light up and do the thingies?
[79:49.90]The flashlight?
[79:51.08]I have the spark, can I have this?
[79:53.22]That thing.
[79:53.88]The thing that I have?
[79:55.74]Yeah, Jerma's got it.
[79:56.32]I think that when you swing, Jerma's got it.
[79:58.20]May I trade you this for this?
[80:00.64]Yeah.
[80:01.75]See how strong you are.
[80:02.69]Let's see if you're a baby boy or if you're a strong superman.
[80:07.93]Gotta grip it as hard as you can, it's only two quarters.
[80:10.62]I think you have to drop it.
[80:12.23]Is this sex?
[80:14.41]What is this?
[80:15.81]TOS.
[80:16.87]Oh, you dropped it, man.
[80:18.15]Oh, there it is.
[80:18.55]It's right there.
[80:19.97]Here it is.
[80:20.69]I'm going to throw it up, and you've got to catch it.
[80:22.49]Is that what I'm talking about?
[80:25.27]Good job.
[80:25.63]All right, I'll bring the spirit box.
[80:31.12]Now with that, when you turn it on... I'll bring my sense of adventure.
[80:33.66]Oh, actually, no, I'm gonna bring the book.
[80:35.16]Take off your shirt and go pre-record it.
[80:36.46]I mean, I wanna make sure you guys don't think of... So the dude's name is Joseph Williams?
[80:39.63]Stop screaming, will ya?
[80:41.95]So that's the guy.
[80:43.27]Joseph Williams.
[80:43.75]I'm gonna bring the book because the pen is mightier than the sword.
[80:47.43]The pen is mightier, Indiana.
[80:49.07]I think I'm gonna watch... I'm gonna be the security guy.
[80:52.35]You're going to do that this time?
[80:53.39]Yeah.
[80:53.73]I mean, you were the brave guy last time.
[80:55.69]I think you earned it.
[80:56.58]Oh, come on.
[80:56.88]I've got to do the cabin.
[80:57.98]This house is scary.
[80:59.10]I like the cabin.
[80:59.92]I think it's nice.
[81:00.94]Did you want to turn down me on the volume, by the way?
[81:03.80]Oh, fuck.
[81:04.23]Let's be real.
[81:04.97]Let's be real.
[81:05.49]Sorry.
[81:06.19]Dude, this reminds me of the thing we did with Lolathon.
[81:10.99]Yeah, it's sort of like that.
[81:12.75]Fuck.
[81:12.89]Fuck.
[81:41.77]This fucking game is so hard.
[81:54.67]Uh... You guys have got 4 minutes and 40 seconds left until the ghost gets angry at you!
[82:34.91]Fucking love this movie.
[82:55.47]Uh... What's that?
[82:59.48]Roger?
[82:59.78]No, no, there's something else.
[83:03.48]There's something else.
[83:03.96]It was, uh... John Williams?
[83:09.00]What is that?
[83:09.32]That's a composer.
[83:10.94]What?
[83:11.35]What was his name?
[83:13.99]Did John Williams do the... Did John Williams do the Lord of the Rings soundtrack?
[83:23.39]Joseph- Joseph Williams.
[83:26.33]Joseph Williams, are you here?
[83:34.58]Yeah, I got the book.
[83:35.42]That's what I'm here for.
[83:36.32]We just got three minutes till we lose.
[83:41.94]We got three minutes till we lose.
[83:43.77]Yo, what up, Derma?
[83:46.11]Is my camera on, Derma?
[83:47.99]Yeah, I can see- I can see-
[83:54.59]Yeah, I got night vision on.
[83:55.73]I can toggle it.
[83:58.07]Let me know, because I got the book.
[84:04.03]What is that over in the corner there?
[84:05.30]That's something scary over there.
[84:06.34]That's me in the corner.
[84:15.72]Hey, what's down there?
[84:16.36]What's that weird large fireplace cover thing?
[84:22.29]Yeah, what is that?
[84:23.43]What's that right there?
[84:35.86]I see nothing.
[84:46.91]I don't see any orbs or any ectoplasm.
[84:53.06]Not that I can tell.
[85:07.05]Everybody's sanity is doing okay, by the way.
[85:08.95]By the way, we had some activity.
[85:10.97]We had some activity.
[85:11.89]Somebody saw some activity.
[85:12.95]What the fuck does that mean?
[85:15.09]I don't know.
[85:23.41]Hey, uh... Hey, Ross, have you seen anything weird lately?
[85:33.65]The lights just went on upstairs automatically.
[85:36.18]Light just went on upstairs automatically.
[85:37.90]I'll mark it.
[85:38.68]I think that was me.
[85:41.00]Yeah, you two have seen something weird.
[85:44.71]Can we get the camera in here?
[85:49.08]I'll be right down.
[86:07.12]Alright, no more making fucking jokes.
[86:10.55]You guys have 22 seconds.
[86:11.55]What are you holding?
[86:14.57]What's he holding?
[86:18.05]In about 15 seconds, you guys are about to be... The ghost is going to be real mad.
[86:25.20]I see the bunny.
[86:25.80]Are you doing a puppet show for me?
[86:32.40]He's trying to like listen.
[86:33.73]Like a conch shell?
[86:36.11]Hey, see if you can hear the ocean.
[86:41.23]Guys, we got large activity happening right now.
[86:44.95]Whatever's happening right now.
[86:45.73]There's large activity happening right now.
[86:47.50]Large activity.
[86:48.86]Can they hear me?
[86:54.08]I don't see any orbs, but you guys are surrounded by activity.
[87:02.09]Not anymore.
[87:06.49]I am pressing the button.
[87:07.17]I'm holding B. Joseph Williams.
[87:17.39]I should just go in there and fucking just stand in the corner.
[87:26.62]You guys, your sanity is dropping.
[87:28.10]You guys are at 74%.
[87:28.62]Yeah, fuck it.
[87:32.22]I'm going in.
[87:40.89]I don't think they can hear me.
[87:41.79]I'm just gonna walk in slowly and be like... Guys, your sanity's at 75%.
[87:45.47]No, dude.
[87:45.85]We gotta get evidence.
[87:53.97]Who has the black light?
[87:56.16]Jerma.
[87:57.24]I'm gonna, uh... What, Jerma?
[87:58.72]What is Jerma?
[88:00.04]I'll come with you.
[88:00.68]Steven Williams.
[88:03.88]I'm in the master bedroom.
[88:05.02]Are you here?
[88:05.60]Give me a sign.
[88:06.26]I think the light's out.
[88:07.84]Yeah, that'd work.
[88:09.07]No, you can turn off the lights.
[88:11.86]Steven Williams, give me a sign.
[88:13.18]Do you have the book, by the way?
[88:14.48]Yeah, I got it right here.
[88:15.75]It's Joseph Williams.
[88:17.39]Joseph Williams.
[88:18.25]Joseph Williams.
[88:19.61]Hey, guys, your sanity's at, like, 75%, so I want to make sure you guys know.
[88:23.55]Alright, do you have the blacklight?
[88:24.95]Jerma, can you see me?
[88:26.99]Let's... I'll grab that for now.
[88:28.77]You want that?
[88:30.51]Yeah, if you want to go to the... Oh, I threw it on the ground.
[88:32.59]Oh, boy, I threw it on the ground.
[88:34.77]Oh, no.
[88:35.03]Where is it?
[88:36.22]I lost another tool.
[88:36.88]It's right here.
[88:37.56]I got it.
[88:38.34]Right here?
[88:39.38]I got it.
[88:41.18]For any ghost babies.
[88:42.56]Can you take it out of my hand?
[88:44.64]I'm gonna try.
[88:45.08]No, no, apparently I put it on my belt.
[88:46.26]You know what?
[88:46.64]I like that better.
[88:47.24]I'm gonna keep it.
[88:47.60]I don't think I can.
[88:48.24]Okay, I'm gonna put it out here so it's really easy to get.
[88:50.96]I'm crab walking.
[88:52.18]Okay, thank you.
[88:53.26]Holy shit.
[88:53.96]Yeah, you are right there.
[88:54.70]Alright, it's on the ground right here.
[89:01.00]Alright.
[89:03.08]So we lost our radio, but I guess we can still hear it.
[89:06.98]We lost the radio?
[89:08.40]I'm looking for the radio right now, over.
[89:10.01]I'm hoping it fell through the floor.
[89:12.45]I gotta stick with you guys because I have nothing.
[89:14.31]Joseph Williams, are you here?
[89:16.87]Did you guys try touching the, like, Home Alone trap?
[89:20.39]Joseph Williams, give us a sign if you are here.
[89:26.36]Uh, guys.
[89:27.10]I heard that.
[89:29.04]I heard.
[89:30.08]Is that you?
[89:31.26]No, no, that wasn't me.
[89:34.46]Ross.
[89:37.87]Thanks, Ross.
[89:39.69]Why are we doing this to each other at both games?
[89:41.85]Why are we doing this?
[89:43.79]We haven't won a single one.
[89:45.24]What about in the attic?
[89:51.84]Joseph Williams, are you here?
[89:56.35]Joseph Williams, are you here?
[89:58.17]How old are you?
[90:08.87]Joseph Williams, how old are you?
[90:10.90]What the fuck was that?
[90:11.78]Joseph Williams, are you here?
[90:38.28]Radio.
[90:40.12]Joseph Williams, put on the Red Sox game.
[90:48.52]Don't touch that dial now.
[90:50.40]We're just getting started.
[90:52.04]Turn off.
[91:03.35]Oh.
[91:08.08]Is there a light?
[91:10.04]Where are you guys?
[91:10.80]I don't know.
[91:13.49]Hey, hey, guys.
[91:15.19]Hey, the lights are flashing upstairs.
[91:16.71]Where are you guys?
[91:17.95]Oh, I think I just turned off all the lights.
[91:21.31]Guys?
[91:22.71]Yeah?
[91:23.77]Can you all come upstairs for a sec?
[91:26.22]Use the radio.
[91:28.26]Oh, shit.
[91:30.38]The lights are flickering up in the attic.
[91:34.52]Lights are flickering in the attic.
[91:35.72]Joseph Williams.
[91:37.98]Somebody's in the... Somebody's in the... I'm in the attic.
[91:40.08]In the attic.
[91:40.42]In the attic.
[91:40.78]In the attic.
[91:41.10]In the attic.
[91:41.42]In the attic.
[91:42.84]In the attic.
[91:44.18]Somebody's talking to me.
[91:44.80]Somebody's whispering to me right now.
[91:47.72]I'm dead, y'all.
[91:50.80]I'm in the attic.
[91:51.82]Up in the attic, guys.
[91:52.58]I'm here alone.
[91:53.20]I heard a whisper.
[91:54.14]What was that noise?
[91:58.19]I have a fucking flashlight up here.
[91:59.51]What did I do up here?
[92:01.77]Somebody just whispered in my ear up in the attic.
[92:06.17]They went like, yo.
[92:08.28]I don't know.
[92:08.70]Something like that.
[92:09.22]I'm going to turn this back on.
[92:13.10]Did the lights just turn back on?
[92:32.28]Do you guys have, uh, radio?
[92:37.42]You guys have- Okay, I'm freaking out in the attic.
[92:40.63]I can't- I can't see.
[92:41.37]Wait a minute.
[92:42.63]Wait a minute, Vinny.
[92:43.21]Vinny, activate your fucking sonar powers and walk around.
[92:59.40]We'll find each other.
[93:00.08]No, just the beep, just the beep.
[93:05.78]If you just walk around.
[93:06.74]If you walk around the house and just move slowly, we can find each other because you're beeping.
[93:31.63]I can hear you.
[93:32.21]I'm not on radio.
[93:32.97]I can hear you.
[93:33.43]I'm in the attic.
[93:34.33]No, I got glue.
[93:35.05]I'm just trying to find the ground.
[94:03.22]This is frustrating.
[94:04.42]This is very frustrating.
[94:05.70]We need to buy more, uh, we need to buy more flashlights.
[94:09.62]That'll probably help quite a bit.
[94:11.56]Oh, uh, massively.
[94:13.46]But we have to get the ghost first.
[94:15.99]Oh.
[94:18.37]We're fucked.
[94:19.75]Yeah, we're totally gone.
[94:21.63]Yeah, we can't, nobody can see anything.
[94:23.15]Not Ross.
[94:23.89]Germa.
[94:24.87]Yeah.
[94:25.55]Germa?
[94:26.21]I'm trying to find the, I'm up in the attic, and I'm trying to find the staircase to go back down.
[94:30.79]It was in the middle.
[94:32.71]I don't know.
[94:33.76]Oh, I think I see the stairs leading to the attic.
[94:35.60]Do you?
[94:36.12]I can hear you.
[94:38.68]I lost you.
[94:39.30]Vinny, where'd you go?
[94:40.32]There's crazy noises happening right now.
[94:42.80]Oh, I found the stairs.
[94:43.64]Yeah, you found the stairs and then the fucking stairs found us too.
[94:47.44]Uh, hi.
[94:48.22]Hey, there you are.
[94:49.14]Oh, dude, I see you.
[94:50.60]I see you.
[94:51.10]Yes, okay, good.
[94:53.08]We have to figure out how to get the hell out of here.
[94:58.53]Let's go, there's a... flashlight!
[94:59.95]What was that noise?
[95:01.35]What noise?
[95:02.15]Did you hear a loud ring bell noise?
[95:05.23]No.
[95:06.49]I got a light.
[95:08.09]Jerma, that's the best light we have right now.
[95:12.74]That's the best we've got for navigation.
[95:15.90]Alright, well that's gonna help a ton because we can actually see some color.
[95:18.67]Can you navigate?
[95:19.57]Do you want to go ahead so we can follow you, Jero?
[95:21.89]Dead body.
[95:22.67]Dead body, dead body.
[95:24.43]Dead body?
[95:24.93]That also may mean... That might mean that there's a flashlight nearby.
[95:33.34]Yes, it would.
[95:34.30]I was at admin, so... Oh, wait!
[95:36.84]Rest in peace, Kiwi.
[95:40.63]Sleep tight, princess.
[95:43.75]I've never fucking played that game once.
[95:47.73]I was in electrical.
[95:48.93]It wasn't me.
[95:50.80]Jeremy, you don't see a flashlight on the ground anywhere?
[95:53.18]No, I just got the blacklight one.
[95:56.02]Can you help us find, um, look on the ground quite a little bit?
[96:00.34]Yeah, would it be down right here somewhere?
[96:02.80]Maybe.
[96:04.02]It's possible.
[96:04.56]It's probably by the body or under the body.
[96:07.04]Oh, gee.
[96:07.48]Maybe that gripped around her body a little bit?
[96:09.88]I just reached in her... Never mind.
[96:12.74]I'm gonna grip around her body until I find something.
[96:14.90]There come the allergies, oh boy.
[96:21.69]Your allergies are hittin' hard, huh?
[96:23.79]Yeah, a little bit, but I'm okay.
[96:25.45]I don't know, I think it's the smoke.
[96:26.83]In LA.
[96:27.75]Or something, I don't know.
[96:29.33]It's gross.
[96:31.49]I don't see a flashlight.
[96:32.19]No, I can't, we can't... Yeah, I think we need to book it.
[96:34.27]I think we need to get the fuck out.
[96:38.38]Where's the exit?
[96:39.26]Okay, um, that's a good question.
[96:46.04]My flashlight's flickering.
[96:46.98]Joseph Williams, if you are here, fuck you.
[96:52.14]Yeah, fuck you.
[96:52.82]Is that a bloody skull?
[96:53.66]Kill my girlfriend, you jackass.
[96:56.06]Jerma, where'd you go?
[96:57.32]I'm right of air.
[96:59.54]Yeah, where's your... The flashlight's flickering.
[97:01.60]Someone's up above us.
[97:02.74]Someone's above us?
[97:03.30]Someone's up above us?
[97:04.90]I hear noises above us, yeah.
[97:07.88]Well, I... Oh, I see Jerma.
[97:10.38]Hi, Jerma.
[97:11.30]I do hear something up there.
[97:11.96]Where are we?
[97:12.82]I was just up there.
[97:15.10]I heard a whisper.
[97:16.82]Jeremiah, help us find the way out, because we can't see shit without you.
[97:19.78]Alright, I got this little rinky-dink light.
[97:22.55]Alright, so let's go this way?
[97:24.73]No, other way.
[97:26.35]Come follow me.
[97:26.87]I don't think this is... You guys see me?
[97:34.67]Yeah.
[97:35.79]Is this connected here?
[97:36.63]I see where you're pointing.
[97:38.45]There's a door here.
[97:39.91]We're on the second floor, but let's see.
[97:42.25]There's a door here.
[97:44.62]This is a bathroom.
[97:46.52]There's a bookcase.
[97:48.80]Maybe we should have left someone back in the truck for the night vision.
[97:54.88]I was in the truck in the night.
[97:57.02]I left the fucking camera upstairs in a room.
[97:59.90]God damn it.
[98:03.19]Oh, wait a minute!
[98:04.50]Oh, it's a window.
[98:05.14]Shit.
[98:08.22]This is a fucking wretched experience with only one flashlight.
[98:12.38]Yeah, we definitely need to save up for more of these things.
[98:14.74]I need to get really close to my screen.
[98:15.99]Chat was right.
[98:17.19]We chose the hardest one.
[98:18.65]Oh, this is the hard one.
[98:19.55]The flashlight keeps flickering over here.
[98:28.32]There you are.
[98:32.73]I can see the truck.
[98:33.67]Okay.
[98:35.28]Guys, we gotta get downstairs.
[98:38.34]Where are you?
[98:39.40]You see the flickering light?
[98:42.28]No.
[98:43.04]No?
[98:43.46]You don't?
[98:44.00]Oh my god, there's somebody near me, I think.
[98:45.05]Oh my god.
[98:46.95]Oh my god.
[98:47.49]Help, help, help, help.
[98:48.39]Oh my god, a screamer behind me screamed at me and I made a noise.
[98:54.95]Oh shit, I found him!
[98:55.89]He's right there, I found him, it's a skeleton!
[98:58.87]Get back, get back, get back to the truck and it's a skeleton.
[99:01.11]It's a bloody skeleton, I found it.
[99:04.55]I can't see shit, you guys just left me.
[99:06.03]Over here, over here, over here.
[99:07.69]Oh, there you are.
[99:09.11]I saw it, it was a bloody skeleton.
[99:11.58]A bloody skeleton?
[99:12.78]Yes, it was a bloody.
[99:13.38]What kind of ghost is that?
[99:14.24]I don't know, he disappeared.
[99:15.76]We got evidence.
[99:18.58]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[99:21.12]Jerma, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta lead us, but... Why are you holding... Oh, I hear a weird-ass... Mugs!
[99:28.58]I just gotta say caffeinated, bro.
[99:30.33]You doing like a duct tape challenge?
[99:35.63]You're really hard to follow.
[99:36.69]Did it kill Vinny?
[99:37.69]Yeah, he's dead.
[99:39.47]Wait, where are you?
[99:40.09]Oh my god, the thing is right here!
[99:42.67]He's right... I don't know where you are.
[99:45.50]You don't see me?
[99:46.14]How the fuck do we not see each other?
[99:47.82]He's right near us.
[99:48.64]He's right next to us somewhere.
[99:49.68]Dude, I can't see you.
[99:51.51]The way your flashlight works, like, unless I maybe took it, I don't know.
[99:57.23]Like, what am I looking at?
[99:58.27]Am I not on your screen?
[99:59.69]I'm right next to you.
[100:00.67]Yeah, no, I see you.
[100:01.35]I see you.
[100:01.87]Okay, there's like a beep.
[100:03.59]There's a heartbeat in my ear.
[100:05.21]What does that mean?
[100:07.29]Um, I don't know.
[100:10.99]I'm gonna find the staircase down.
[100:13.61]We're in a bedroom right now.
[100:16.05]We're in a bedroom?
[100:16.77]Let's communicate.
[100:18.51]Joseph Williams, we mean you no harm.
[100:22.54]Joseph Williams, we mean you no harm.
[100:28.70]Joseph Williams, we come in peace.
[100:32.24]How about we move very slowly?
[100:33.66]Okay.
[100:34.62]But you, like, point the camera a little bit at the ground, because if you block the direction of the light, I can't see you.
[100:41.99]I lose you completely.
[100:44.45]Are you good now?
[100:46.14]Yeah, I can see where you're pointing on the ground.
[100:48.16]Okay.
[100:49.87]So we need to find the stairs out of here.
[100:55.29]Good luck.
[100:56.43]I have no idea what the hell we could do.
[100:58.06]I don't even know where we even are.
[101:02.66]I'm just shimmying.
[101:05.00]Shimmy, shimmy.
[101:06.12]This is a wall.
[101:08.00]Joseph is his name?
[101:09.95]Yeah, Joseph, uh, Joseph Joestar.
[101:12.43]I think we're not in the right spot.
[101:14.65]Joseph Joestar?
[101:15.47]It's the bathroom.
[101:18.43]That's a toilet.
[101:20.85]So that is wrong.
[101:24.12]So you saw a bloody skeleton?
[101:25.64]That's probably like a big clue.
[101:27.36]Wait, is that stairs right there?
[101:29.11]Turn around?
[101:29.53]Yep, bingo.
[101:30.41]What's this?
[101:31.27]Stairs going down.
[101:31.93]Let's get the hell out of here.
[101:33.47]Let's get the hell out of this frickin' place.
[101:35.67]Whatever is a bloody skeleton?
[101:40.75]We gotta look through the journal and see what a skeleton with all of its skin off is.
[101:43.57]I think that's just a skeleton.
[101:47.72]Did it have muscle?
[101:48.90]Or is it just a skeleton?
[101:49.82]I don't know.
[101:50.40]It's kind of like waterlogged.
[101:53.03]Waterlogged okay like that all right.
[101:54.95]This is good.
[101:55.45]This is good strat.
[101:56.33]Okay.
[101:56.89]We're gonna be close to the door now You look in front over this way This is working this is working.
[102:05.24]Okay.
[102:05.60]I don't see this looks like a living room.
[102:07.84]Yeah, I think we're gonna Is that you okay?
[102:12.12]Our breath our breath is cold.
[102:13.26]It's very cold.
[102:13.76]Holy shit.
[102:14.40]What a clue so that's oh
[102:16.66]Another clue.
[102:17.08]That's a clue.
[102:17.58]That's a clue.
[102:18.78]Breath cold equals... Keep pointing at the floor.
[102:22.22]That's the only way I'm going to see you.
[102:23.24]Oh, that's the truck.
[102:24.60]He's in here somewhere.
[102:25.26]I think he's in here.
[102:26.22]I've got the writing thing.
[102:29.54]Put the book down.
[102:33.16]Joseph.
[102:33.99]It's right here on the ground.
[102:36.91]It's walking.
[102:37.75]Yo, write something, bitch.
[102:39.55]Don't anger him.
[102:42.42]You're going to anger him.
[102:43.38]I'm right behind you.
[102:43.90]Oh.
[102:45.24]You have to be nice.
[102:50.12]The walls could start shaking.
[102:53.80]Do you want to get out?
[102:55.32]Okay, here we go.
[102:56.06]Follow me.
[102:56.86]Do you see me?
[102:57.20]Okay.
[102:58.42]Yeah, I see you.
[102:58.96]I see you.
[102:59.30]Just keep pointing at the ground.
[103:00.24]That's the only way I'll see around you.
[103:02.72]Yeah, yeah.
[103:03.24]Beautiful, beautiful.
[103:03.84]Is that the door right there?
[103:04.70]Because we saw the truck out the window.
[103:06.12]Holy shit.
[103:06.92]This is the door.
[103:07.70]We're out.
[103:09.21]Hey, oppa!
[103:11.21]That was easy.
[103:12.03]We did it.
[103:13.37]Easy, dude.
[103:14.15]I wasn't even fucking scared.
[103:17.11]Look at those two babies.
[103:18.41]They died.
[103:19.03]Alright, let's have a look.
[103:22.06]Let's figure out what this is.
[103:23.48]This is a... Uh, introducing ghosts.
[103:28.70]Okay, hold on.
[103:30.00]Oh, wait, no.
[103:32.42]We got it.
[103:32.96]Jack, we got it.
[103:35.00]We totally got this.
[103:36.00]We got this.
[103:36.72]Easy.
[103:37.50]Wait, I'm trying to grab the book.
[103:39.89]So, let's see.
[103:42.19]Are you able to grab the book?
[103:43.89]I got the book in my hand right now.
[103:45.83]Spirit.
[103:46.27]You do?
[103:46.53]Yeah, it definitely wasn't a spirit.
[103:48.10]Okay.
[103:49.50]We had cold breath, right?
[103:51.70]Yeah, we had cold breath.
[103:54.64]And we saw a skeleton.
[103:56.94]Damn, we were really close to dying.
[103:59.22]Yeah, we were.
[104:00.26]Like, it was definitely hunting us.
[104:01.90]I had 0%.
[104:10.32]Gin?
[104:15.36]Uh... The flashlight was in the truck the whole time.
[104:18.26]Guys, the flashlight was in the truck the whole time.
[104:24.40]I saw it.
[104:24.84]It was like a scary looking thing.
[104:26.88]It looked like a... It was like a... Like a hollow from Dark Souls.
[104:32.13]With blood all over him.
[104:34.61]A gin?
[104:35.15]It could be a gin.
[104:37.69]Let me have a look.
[104:41.79]headset is really blurry wait a mirror is powerful in the dark all right we evidence we would cold breath right we definitely put that down that's yeah we got called we definitely got cold breath what about um nothing else besides that that we have
[105:02.09]Well, we got a, we got a, let's see.
[105:04.17]It'll be a phantom.
[105:05.80]So we, we got a, what was our EMF level?
[105:09.20]Did we ever see?
[105:09.88]It was, it was at six.
[105:11.80]I don't even know.
[105:13.02]At the maximum activity.
[105:16.18]Book.
[105:16.46]Spirit box.
[105:18.24]We didn't see, I didn't see fingerprints.
[105:19.66]I didn't see ghost orbs.
[105:21.78]I didn't see ghost writing.
[105:22.86]We did get freezing temperatures though.
[105:24.14]So there's one clue.
[105:25.20]And he said, get the book.
[105:28.03]The book?
[105:29.03]He said get the book. The book-
[105:31.03]Why?
[105:32.03]I don't know, Vinny's- he's trying to tell us to get the book. We left the book in the house.
[105:37.03]The book. But why would we need it?
[105:39.03]I don't know. I got a flashlight now though, where was it? Where was- where is it? In the house?
[105:43.03]Do you want to bring a camera so you can... like- I can watch you?
[105:47.03]Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah again where's that where's that HD DVD camera?
[105:51.03]There's a HD DVD. Can you do both? Light and camera?
[105:55.03]I'm gonna try to get a picture of this motherfucker I swear to god.
[106:01.14]If I get a cool pic of this, that's worth a lot of money, even if I'm dead.
[106:12.11]It looked like a skeleton with skin hanging off of him.
[106:17.33]I'm going to get a picture.
[106:18.09]How do I take a photo?
[106:19.59]Oh, just like that.
[106:20.32]Okay.
[106:20.52]Are you going to stick around there?
[106:28.44]He locked the door.
[106:29.42]He closed it on me and locked the door.
[106:31.32]And I was too afraid to take a photo.
[106:33.42]Oh, the electrical box is out here.
[107:16.10]I don't know.
[107:16.38]He's making noise.
[107:17.98]He's walking.
[107:18.40]I don't know where he is, though.
[107:22.90]Yeah, I was walking around the side of the house.
[107:31.53]If I can get a picture, man, then we're gonna be millionaires.
[107:37.13]He locked the front door.
[107:37.91]He closed it on me.
[107:38.55]He slammed the front door in my face.
[107:40.99]Locked it.
[107:51.66]I'm gonna try the back door.
[107:58.19]Pretty good.
[107:59.05]I'm gonna do some light reading on ghosts.
[108:00.63]We can, we can send that in.
[108:03.69]Yeah, see if you can figure anything out.
[108:04.57]I'm gonna try to get a photo of him.
[108:12.51]I'm in the house.
[108:17.01]Uh, okay, you got, you're at 0%, so I'll check your, uh,
[108:21.79]I'll check you later.
[108:23.73]I'm just trying to get a picture, man.
[108:25.13]It's all I care about.
[108:28.37]Wish I had this camera earlier.
[108:33.00]I don't think that camera tracks back to the truck, though.
[108:37.02]Just FYI.
[108:37.62]Oh, it doesn't?
[108:38.92]Yeah, the camera that did track back to the truck was left upstairs.
[108:45.14]Looks like someone was holding it when they died, so I can't actually track you.
[108:49.27]Oh, shit.
[108:50.17]Oh, right.
[108:50.49]This is the still camera.
[108:58.82]I might die.
[108:59.38]Can you hear me?
[109:22.97]Roger.
[109:23.33]Yep.
[109:23.47]Over.
[109:23.77]I'm going to try and turn on the light of the... I'm going to try and turn the lights on.
[109:32.49]Lights work.
[109:36.37]Oh my god!
[109:40.77]I didn't get it!
[109:44.55]I didn't get it!
[109:45.29]It was... I'm dead.
[109:53.53]I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead.
[110:00.53]This is where I die.
[110:05.90]You don't seem to have any weird levels going up.
[110:09.10]It seems like it's flatlining right now, so you seem to be safe.
[110:11.66]Oh, really?
[110:12.12]Yeah, no weird activity on the radar.
[110:17.97]Maybe he's upstairs then.
[110:19.35]Maybe he doesn't hang out over here.
[110:22.69]Yeah, he might be.
[110:24.31]Wait, where did Vinny say the book was?
[110:26.49]Oh, shit.
[110:27.03]I found the book.
[110:28.29]And there's writing in this book.
[110:31.58]It's a, um, it's a, it's a, it's a, uh, it's a doctor thing.
[110:36.90]No, it's not.
[110:37.36]It's a triangles with going down.
[110:39.02]It's an infinity eight symbol sideways with a line going up the top and two lines going through it.
[110:43.76]Brimstone.
[110:44.32]Okay, there's a brimstone on the left.
[110:48.23]I'll just get it.
[110:51.51]We got Freezing Breath and Brimstone.
[110:53.45]He's gonna kill me, I'm dead in like five seconds.
[110:54.80]Hey dude, it was really nice knowing you, I'm dead in like two seconds, I can hear him coming over here right now.
[110:59.32]Brimstone, and then... Hello.
[111:01.74]As quick as you can, Jerma.
[111:03.66]Brimstone, and then... Demon, maybe?
[111:15.65]Jerma?
[111:18.41]Jerma?
[111:21.73]Who's... Who's this?
[111:24.72]Can you guys hear me?
[111:32.22]At least we read the book.
[111:33.44]I got it.
[111:33.94]Brimstone.
[111:34.74]Brimstone, and what was the other thing on the other side? ...
[111:54.27]Hope he figures it out That was Lucifer's sigil oh That's Damon for sure.
[112:02.80]Oh look we get it.
[112:04.36]It's a Damon for sure I can't take the like fucking noises.
[112:19.17]Oh
[112:22.25]I should have taken the book and ran.
[112:27.25]Yeah, but, I mean, here's the thing.
[112:30.40]I didn't know, I couldn't read it.
[112:32.10]I was freaking out.
[112:38.78]Ghost or ghost riding freezing temperatures.
[112:42.08]What else?
[112:44.28]It's a da- it's a fucking demon.
[112:45.46]It's a demon.
[112:46.10]It's a demon.
[112:48.11]It's a demon.
[112:57.25]Steven, he'll get it.
[112:59.81]Turn my lights off.
[113:04.35]Welcome back.
[113:05.17]There's some drops ready for you.
[113:08.87]Oh, wait.
[113:09.37]What does that mean?
[113:11.61]I got 20 bucks.
[113:12.89]Did we get demon?
[113:13.39]Wait, you didn't guess demon?
[113:15.07]I did guess demon.
[113:15.77]Yeah, I did.
[113:17.15]Got it.
[113:17.31]25 bucks.
[113:17.47]Well, I got 10 bucks.
[113:18.39]I got 5 bucks.
[113:24.20]Man, flashlights are expensive.
[113:25.92]It wasn't a demon.
[113:28.74]No, it wasn't.
[113:29.84]Did we find out what it was?
[113:31.04]No, it says the ghost was a demon right there.
[113:33.48]Oh!
[113:33.76]We got it, then.
[113:35.44]We got it.
[113:35.84]Yeah, we got it.
[113:36.84]Nice.
[113:37.60]We got it.
[113:38.34]Oh, team.
[113:39.98]So when we were ghosts, none of us could hear each other?
[113:42.38]Is that... Right.
[113:43.96]I heard Jerma, but I couldn't hear you guys.
[113:47.35]I could hear both of you, but you couldn't hear me.
[113:51.73]Wait, when you die, do you lose your inventory?
[113:54.87]Or is it, this is like one-time use stuff?
[113:58.26]I don't know.
[113:58.62]This is experience gain.
[113:59.80]I'm almost level two.
[114:01.06]Parabolic microphone.
[114:02.18]I think we keep the stuff we buy.
[114:04.49]Yeah, I think we keep it.
[114:05.67]I think eventually we're just going to be like gods.
[114:07.29]We're going to be like the mystery machine crew.
[114:11.67]Scooby-Doo.
[114:12.95]Where are you?
[114:14.65]If you die, you lose everything.
[114:16.57]Can you imagine if you did this in real life and lost three of your friends and made $20?
[114:21.38]I'd say that was pretty great, honestly.
[114:28.26]Do you think they put these kind of jobs up on TaskRabbit?
[114:32.13]TaskRabbit?
[114:33.99]Yeah, it's an app where you can put in calls to get a carpenter.
[114:39.30]Like Fiverr?
[114:39.94]Yeah, like Fiverr, but for someone to come to your house and put shit together.
[114:43.18]It says, make sure someone doesn't leave the flashlight in the van this time.
[114:50.26]Yeah, we can't leave that behind.
[114:52.28]We have to be very... I thought we brought it.
[114:55.26]I thought we did too.
[114:56.76]What should I buy?
[114:59.77]I'm gonna save up.
[115:00.53]I want a bigger flashlight.
[115:01.59]I want like a novelty size flashlight.
[115:04.20]I want a floodlight.
[115:05.66]Can we get a tripod?
[115:08.84]You can get a tripod?
[115:09.82]Yeah.
[115:10.10]For the camera?
[115:10.70]Yeah, you can set the camera up proper.
[115:13.36]Oh, we should do that.
[115:14.34]Do we want to go one more?
[115:16.56]Yeah.
[115:16.97]Yeah, I think so.
[115:17.97]Maybe like...
[115:19.53]Okay, let's do chat.
[115:21.23]What's a good one for us to do as a start?
[115:24.39]Yeah, like for babies.
[115:27.25]What's a good baby one?
[115:29.07]Do an easy map?
[115:30.51]Tanglewood.
[115:32.11]Tanglewood?
[115:33.57]Yeah.
[115:34.61]Alright.
[115:38.60]Live cameras with someone in the truck is OP.
[115:42.16]What is that?
[115:44.68]Cruise fix is really important.
[115:47.06]When you buy a thing, you have to add it to the...
[115:50.50]You know, the thing.
[115:52.54]Oh, you gotta add it.
[115:53.48]We don't have, does it, nobody has a crucifix, right?
[115:55.06]Do we not have it at crucifix?
[115:56.68]No, we don't have one.
[115:57.58]If we, we need those for banshees.
[116:03.20]And we, we gotta make sure we pay attention to the whiteboard.
[116:07.36]Whiteboard.
[116:08.46]Okay.
[116:09.02]Right at the beginning, we gotta, there's objectives on it, and that's how you get the money.
[116:14.06]Oh, we gotta add the gear.
[116:15.26]Okay.
[116:18.38]So we have...
[116:21.57]Total items.
[116:25.31]So apparently, yeah, we don't get money unless we fill out.
[116:27.65]Even if you're dead, you can still fill out your journal.
[116:29.85]But I was unable to do so.
[116:32.86]When you're a ghost, you gotta do your tasks.
[116:34.92]Just like Among Us.
[116:37.04]I know that game.
[116:37.62]Wait, it says select job?
[116:44.32]Do I do that?
[116:46.10]Yeah, do Tanglewood, Ross.
[116:48.84]Oh, Tanglewood.
[116:50.78]Okay.
[116:53.39]Are there only three houses right now?
[116:56.73]Are they randomly generated?
[116:57.59]I'm not sure.
[116:59.85]I don't know.
[117:00.21]I guess.
[117:00.51]All right.
[117:01.39]I'm readying up.
[117:05.19]Ready.
[117:06.69]All right.
[117:08.84]Powerade.
[117:09.22]You know what it is.
[117:09.68]I did it like ten times this stream already.
[117:12.30]Powerade.
[117:13.02]I'm bleeding through to you guys.
[117:14.54]Sorry.
[117:14.76]I'm just trying to talk to my chat.
[117:15.72]Sorry about that.
[117:21.70]I'm still a siren, right?
[117:24.40]Yeah.
[117:25.44]Chat, we've done everything we can to try and fix Vinny's beeping.
[117:30.51]We don't know what's causing it.
[117:34.07]It's just a way of life now.
[117:37.57]What I understand is it says it's partially random.
[117:40.03]Missions and ghosts are random.
[117:41.90]So you have to unlock new maps, yeah.
[117:46.08]So, Jerma, when you're ready.
[117:47.76]Oh, shit.
[117:49.18]I'm sorry.
[117:52.52]I was looking at the chat.
[117:53.68]They were saying some things.
[117:54.76]Are we ready to go, guys?
[117:56.57]I think we're ready.
[117:58.37]This one we're gonna win.
[117:59.81]Again.
[118:01.99]We did win that last one.
[118:03.43]It was a little sloppy, but we did alright.
[118:04.99]We did good.
[118:12.88]Got the key.
[118:16.30]Okay.
[118:18.20]Alright, objectives.
[118:21.14]We need a photo of the ghost.
[118:23.68]We gotta get a photo of the dirty water in the sink.
[118:26.20]That's like a $10 objective.
[118:28.86]And then we need to find evidence of paranormal on the EMF reader.
[118:32.71]Easy.
[118:33.61]I'll do the flashlight this time.
[118:35.19]I'll keep it good.
[118:36.07]I'll make it nice.
[118:37.75]I'll carry the blacklight.
[118:40.01]The ghost name is Joseph Brown.
[118:42.34]Guys, we got a candle.
[118:43.66]Joseph Brown.
[118:45.80]Joseph Brown.
[118:47.24]Joseph Brown.
[118:51.54]If I'm doing the flashlight, if anyone wants to use my glow stick, that sounds like an innuendo.
[118:56.88]It's not.
[118:57.50]Who wants this?
[118:59.24]I got a candle.
[119:01.12]You got a candle?
[119:01.62]Does anyone have a... I'll take the glow stick.
[119:03.96]Oh, yeah.
[119:04.20]You take the glow stick, Gewee.
[119:06.94]Does anyone want the Game Boy?
[119:09.61]I had one, but it's gone now.
[119:11.15]We don't have any lighters.
[119:11.89]The Game Boy.
[119:13.33]I mean, I guess I'll take it.
[119:14.47]I don't know.
[119:16.82]Yeah, you take Game Boy.
[119:19.12]Jerma, you take Game Boy.
[119:20.90]I have the photo camera, too.
[119:24.97]I'll bring the sage for good vibes.
[119:27.39]No, don't bring it.
[119:28.49]Why?
[119:29.31]Because if you drop it and die, we don't get it back, and we can't use it because we have no lighter.
[119:33.31]Look at that gamer posture.
[119:35.17]I think we're ready.
[119:41.59]Let's roll out.
[119:42.43]Let's go beat the shit out of some ghosts.
[119:43.77]Oh, it's this house again.
[119:44.73]Tutorial house, yeah.
[119:45.95]I like this house, it's... Wait, this house has got a serious ghost problem.
[119:50.07]We're here every week.
[119:53.75]Yeah, we... It's just an escape room.
[119:56.51]We're ghost busters.

[120:05.81]Joseph Brown, are you in town?
[120:07.60]Joseph Brown, are you here?
[120:12.87]Are you around?
[120:14.43]Joseph Brown, are you here?
[120:16.21]Joseph Brown!
[120:17.35]Oh, I need to get out of town.
[120:18.27]Joseph Brown?
[120:20.50]Guys, they've got a bread box.
[120:22.20]You know their bread is fresh.
[120:24.22]Joseph Brown, are you here?
[120:25.24]All right, where's the dirty sink?
[120:26.46]Give us a sign.
[120:28.02]Joseph Brown.
[120:28.74]Hey, let me try something, guys.
[120:30.06]Hey, Joey, how you doing?
[120:31.58]It's me, Vinny, okay?
[120:32.64]You know me from the block.
[120:33.82]I need you to tell me a little something, okay?
[120:38.76]Nope, nothing works.
[120:40.82]Hey, Joey, you here?
[120:43.23]Hey Joey, so you like to cook?
[120:49.40]So, oh, we gotta get a picture of the scum in the sink, right?
[120:51.90]Yeah.
[120:52.04]Where's the sink?
[120:52.84]Hey, Giwi.
[120:54.08]Yeah?
[120:54.88]If I see that ghost, you know what I'm gonna do?
[120:56.22]I'm gonna tell him to fork off.
[120:59.90]Vinny, this picture that we get, I want you in the photo.
[121:03.27]Alright.
[121:03.75]I want you in the photo, like, throwing up, like, the peace sign or something.
[121:05.97]You should bring the fork with you, so you can tell him that.
[121:08.45]I think he's a fan of the culinary arts, Joey.
[121:12.66]What the fuck is that?
[121:13.94]Who's flat water?
[121:14.86]Oh!
[121:15.66]Dirty sink!

[121:20.26]Joseph Brown!
[121:22.23]Alright, no, no, crouch down here.
[121:23.81]Crouch down here.
[121:25.77]In front of the sink.
[121:26.33]No, I already got it.
[121:26.87]I got it.
[121:27.31]Alright, here we go.
[121:28.49]Ready?
[121:28.73]Was that dirty water?
[121:31.09]Whoa, I teleported.
[121:31.89]Wrong sink.
[121:32.39]There's no dirty water in that sink.
[121:38.11]Good.
[121:39.89]Okay, we only got a couple photos left, so I think we have to be very careful.
[121:44.88]Chat, what do the keys do?
[121:46.12]I collected several keys.
[121:52.32]Okay, so if the lights go out, guys, this is the room we have to go to.
[121:55.98]There's a breaker box?
[121:57.86]The breaker's here, I think.

[125:12.54]I don't know.
[125:13.00]He said, like, attack.
[125:14.40]Okay, so that's evidence, guys.
[125:16.37]That's what I like to call evidence.
[125:18.73]So we have two pieces of evidence currently.
[125:21.85]Spirit box and fingerprints.
[125:24.21]Yeah.
[125:25.23]Okay.
[125:27.27]Fingerprints and... So now we just need either writing journal or EMF.
[125:33.46]Right.
[125:33.64]Okay.
[125:34.63]So I have the EMF thing.
[125:36.66]Does anyone want to come back with me to the van and get a writing journal?
[125:39.96]Yeah, I'll come with you.
[125:40.48]Let's go.
[125:40.72]All right, I don't know how to get there.
[125:42.24]I left the journal.
[125:43.04]It's right here.
[125:44.02]We need a journal.
[125:45.10]We got the journal on the ground.
[125:45.92]Put it on the floor.
[125:47.08]So if we leave the room, he might write in it when we come back.
[125:49.67]Oh, that's right.
[125:50.01]Yeah, turn the light off.
[125:50.51]So we'll do that, but someone should go to the van and look at the footage of the camera.
[125:54.77]That way we can see if there's a orb.
[125:56.35]Okay, hold on.
[125:56.89]Oh, shit.
[125:57.29]Where am I?
[125:58.17]I'm coming.
[126:00.72]Me and Kiwi will go to the car.

[126:03.46]Wait, if we're going to the car, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, take this.
[126:07.32]What's that?
[126:07.82]The EMV thing.
[126:09.90]If it goes to red, that's evidence.
[126:11.71]Oh, shit, okay.
[126:12.81]I'll be here.
[126:14.39]And take this fork for good luck.
[126:16.33]It served me well.
[126:16.85]Yeah, if you get hungry, take this fork and have yourself a little snack.
[126:20.17]There's a bread box right here.
[126:21.57]Alright, let's go to the car.
[126:23.03]Alright, so I'm just gonna walk around with this thing.
[126:26.83]I need a light.
[126:27.49]Vinny, do you have a light?
[126:28.49]Right here.
[126:31.41]Oh, nice.
[126:32.41]We're good.
[126:33.29]Alright, so when you guys get to the van, take a look at the camera.
[126:41.77]Good luck out there!
[126:44.90]We're doing well, but definitely look for orbs on the camera.
[126:48.86]I'm Vinny's gamer chair.

[128:08.19]And a painting fell- Painting just fell off the wall.
[128:10.80]This might be a poltergeist.
[128:11.76]What are we looking at?

[128:14.56]Is there a painting on the ground?

[129:01.70]You see me?
[129:03.20]Vinny, Vinny, uh, the camera's back here somewhere on the stairs.

[129:15.20]I'm looking at it?
[129:16.90]You're looking good.
[129:18.19]Letting clean camera the camera is gone.

[130:41.42]Wait.
[130:43.79]Is that just me you're seeing?
[130:47.35]I think the camera's stuck in the wall, so it's not loading the rest of you.
[130:50.37]We just see jeans walking around.
[130:52.79]Yeah, it looks just like the wrong trousers.
[130:55.35]Walls and grommet.
[130:55.96]Very cool.
[130:56.58]Vinny, you want to go take a look at the book?

[131:07.38]Any writing?
[131:08.08]Empty book.
[131:17.17]Your sanity is still quite high, but Vinny's is a little lower than... You guys are around 55% each.
[131:28.78]The lights went out.
[131:30.82]Yeah, the lights are out.
[131:32.78]The lights are out.
[131:33.94]Joseph Brown, are you here?
[131:44.84]Joseph Brown, are you here?
[131:50.39]Oh shit, I've lost again.
[131:51.97]Is that in the basement or is that in the garage?
[131:57.19]It's in the garage.
[131:58.15]Yo, Jerma.
[131:59.04]What's up?

[132:14.02]Yeah, it's right there.
[132:15.78]Let's turn on the lights.
[132:16.61]Oh, you guys did it already.
[132:17.53]Nice.
[132:19.75]It's here, but it's through something.
[132:22.13]What are the rooms around this house?
[132:24.03]There's tea.
[132:24.61]Yeah, it's janked.
[132:25.53]I think we can leave.
[132:28.03]We got all the evidence.
[132:29.01]What about the sink?
[132:29.71]What about the dirty sink?
[132:33.62]What's the third thing?
[132:34.76]Did you get the EMS?
[132:36.50]We didn't get EMS.
[132:38.28]We gotta check the sink still, I guess.
[132:39.86]Guys, there's another handprint right here.
[132:42.43]Yeah, that's already, we got it.
[132:44.05]This, I think this is a poltergeist based on the handprints.
[132:46.33]Ooh, I heard, I heard something.
[132:47.87]Radio.
[132:48.17]There was EMF.
[132:49.08]I'm being told there was EMF.
[132:50.72]Which one of you had the EMF reader?
[132:52.16]Hello?
[132:58.02]German's made contact.
[132:59.32]He's talking.
[133:00.08]German made contact.
[133:01.94]Joseph Brown.
[133:03.44]Are you here?
[133:03.82]An adult?
[133:09.48]He's an adult.
[133:11.26]He's an adult.
[133:12.06]That means his age.
[133:13.50]Joseph Brown, how old are you?
[133:19.72]Joseph Brown, where are you?
[133:21.16]The light scared him off.
[133:26.38]You might have turned that off, Vinny.
[133:28.02]Yeah, it's not going to work the lights on.
[133:30.22]Joseph Brown, how old are you?
[133:35.16]Joseph Brown.
[133:37.30]Joseph Brown, are you friendly?
[133:43.40]Are you angry?
[133:44.26]Who cares?
[133:47.74]He said attack, he said attack.
[133:48.68]Let's get the fuck outta here.
[133:50.46]Hey, Joseph Brown, see what happens!
[133:54.18]Guys, our readings at- Guys, our reading went up to four.
[133:58.99]So we got- Yeah, we- we got- That- that's close enough in my opinion.
[134:04.09]No, it's- it's five is the- the evidence threshold.
[134:07.95]Apparently Chad said they saw a five.
[134:10.20]It- Okay, well, I'll believe him.
[134:12.99]It looks like it could have gone up to a five.
[134:14.53]I mean, it is at a three and a four here.
[134:17.18]So we got fingerprint, spirit box, and... You got a five.
[134:20.64]I was told we got a five.
[134:22.08]We got a five?
[134:22.98]Okay, I'll believe chat.
[134:24.08]I'm not seeing anything come up for ghosts with that.
[134:28.71]We didn't get a photo of the dirty sink.
[134:32.33]We didn't get any ghost writing.
[134:33.89]We didn't get freaking pictures.
[134:38.95]Yeah, fuck the sink.
[134:39.51]We don't need a picture of the sink.
[134:40.56]It don't matter.
[134:43.02]It's 10 bucks, whatever.
[134:44.19]Like, that's nothing, right?
[134:51.55]Joseph Brown.
[134:54.07]What are you doing?
[134:55.35]Or something.
[134:55.99]I don't know.
[135:01.89]It's like a, there's a line here, and like I'm seeing that this is his line, and I'm like stepping over it a little bit.
[135:08.00]Hey, Joseph Brown, I'm not over your line yet.
[135:09.70]Joseph Brown, not over the line yet.
[135:11.02]Not over the line yet.
[135:11.70]Not over the line yet.
[135:13.08]Not over the line yet.
[135:15.78]Hey.
[135:16.86]Oh, shit.
[135:17.10]Maybe we should drop this book in here and see if he writes anything.
[135:19.56]He won't come back.
[135:21.98]Yeah, that's great.
[135:26.77]You're gonna make him angry.
[135:29.53]What did you say to him?
[135:31.30]Oh, typical banter, you know.
[135:34.33]He said his age was E. E?
[135:37.79]What?
[135:38.37]He kept saying adult.
[135:39.51]Yeah, I don't know.
[135:40.29]When you asked what his age was, he said E. He said, are you there?
[135:43.43]He said adult.
[135:44.53]Yeah, he said adult.
[135:45.84]Other chat is saying we didn't get a five.
[135:47.62]This is just a caveman.
[135:48.97]There's no ghosts.
[135:49.85]There's no ghosts.
[135:50.41]We didn't get a five.
[135:51.15]So we left the book in by the hallway.
[135:55.05]This fucking guy died like 10,000 years ago in this spot where this house was built.
[136:01.94]Of course he's a... Attack!
[136:05.03]Me, adult.
[136:06.36]Me, attack you.
[136:07.72]Like, this dude died here.
[136:08.64]He was a caveman?
[136:09.70]Yeah, he's a caveman from, like, 30,000 years ago.
[136:11.56]He was killed by a mammoth?
[136:13.02]Like, 3,000 years, 4,000 million years ago?
[136:14.70]I mean, the... Can, um... Can the other stuff throw objects around?
[136:20.31]Me, kill.
[136:21.09]Me, kill.
[136:22.01]Me, kill.
[136:22.75]Attack.
[136:23.41]Mammoth.
[136:24.03]Let's find out.
[136:25.47]Love it.
[136:27.46]Did we get all the pictures that we need, by the way?
[136:31.02]Big bird in sky.
[136:33.12]Ripped skull off head.
[136:35.80]Big bird, big egg.
[136:37.58]I tried to get egg from nest.
[136:42.84]Lost head and scalp.
[136:47.07]We did see that.
[136:47.85]Poltergeist is almost ineffective in an empty room.
[136:51.45]Spirit box, fingerprints, and ghost orb.
[136:53.16]The only thing we didn't get was a ghost orb, but our camera is now fucking in a wall, so there's no way that's going to happen.
[136:58.58]We're never going to find out if there was a ghost orb.
[137:00.96]That's a no-go.
[137:02.18]What's the other thing?
[137:03.42]Oh, shit.
[137:03.96]Ow.
[137:09.83]I believe we are poltergeist.
[137:13.61]Let me lock in poltergeist too before we confirm that.
[137:17.32]I'm just reading up real quick before we decide.
[137:22.48]Also, Germa, you want to get in there and take a couple more photos?
[137:30.22]I got zero left to take.
[137:31.86]I'm going with Poltergeist.
[137:35.56]Just because I saw that thing fall off the wall, I'm sure it's Geist.
[137:42.51]This is fun, by the way.
[137:43.81]Once we got it all figured out, this is a good-ass game.
[137:49.05]I had to change the control scheme, though, because I had tons of problems.
[137:53.35]Yeah, I think it's a folder, guys, too, having read all these.
[137:56.35]This is great.
[137:56.83]Yeah, it's a folder, guys.
[137:58.21]So, here's what we have here, guys.
[138:01.91]It says here, discover what type of ghost we're dealing with.
[138:03.97]So, objective one that we're working on.
[138:05.60]Okay, we think we got that.
[138:07.08]Capture a photo of the ghost we don't have, and we still didn't get the dirty water in the sink.
[138:12.36]So, it looks like we only got the EMF reader evidence.
[138:18.62]Was it freezing in there?
[138:20.44]We didn't get good sink picture.
[138:22.28]Do we need to take a picture of the EMF reader?
[138:24.99]Is that what we have to do?
[138:27.05]No, that one's good.
[138:28.41]We got the EMF one.
[138:29.95]Okay.
[138:30.73]Is that why it's gray?
[138:31.80]I took a few photos accidentally.
[138:33.12]I shouldn't have the camera ever again.
[138:35.66]You guys took some really nice photos, though.
[138:37.20]They look great.
[138:38.87]Memories.
[138:42.26]Capture a photo of the ghost.
[138:44.33]Probably the best we can do.
[138:45.51]Yeah, the photo of the ghost is probably going to be in the same room where the orbs are.
[138:49.31]You just go in with the camera, take a picture where the orb is.
[138:51.95]But we can't do much without the camera.
[138:53.63]We can't see the orbs.
[138:55.25]Yeah.
[138:55.92]So we're done.
[138:57.46]We're boned.
[138:58.00]Yeah.
[138:59.00]Let's go boulder, guys.
[139:00.10]Let's lock it in.
[139:01.74]Alright.
[139:05.36]Did everyone enter?
[139:06.08]Looking for ten bucks.
[139:08.77]Well, give me that ten dollars.
[139:12.51]Hello the Journal?
[139:13.13]I did, didn't I?
[139:17.09]Welcome back.
[139:17.93]There's some drops ready for you.
[139:22.31]It was a Wraith?
[139:23.93]What the fuck?
[139:27.96]What?
[139:28.36]How could?
[139:28.68]What?
[139:28.90]It was a Wraith.
[139:30.82]It was a Wraith?
[139:32.60]Oh, you can't look at the book here.
[139:34.86]I wanted to know why it was a Wraith.
[139:37.58]Shit.
[139:39.12]God damn it.
[139:40.58]Fuck.
[139:40.86]I thought we had it.
[139:42.38]I thought we had it too.
[139:43.34]I really did.
[139:43.88]Omega lull.
[139:47.28]Uh, that's my fault.
[139:48.38]I was convinced it was Poltergeist.
[139:50.18]That's my fault.
[139:50.82]I took too many photos of things that... Where's the stupid... It was the game's fault.
[139:56.39]The camera went through the wall.
[139:58.55]That's true.
[139:59.03]That's true.
[139:59.59]The camera did go through the wall.
[140:01.49]We had a little bit of a glitch there.
[140:04.05]It's fun to take the blame and put it on something else like the game.
[140:07.59]Yeah.
[140:07.83]It's cool.
[140:08.27]I agree.
[140:08.89]Yeah.
[140:09.97]I think I would much prefer to do that than take the blame myself.
[140:15.15]Well, is it past midnight where you are now?
[140:20.38]I guess it would be, right?
[140:22.80]It's 1.40 a.m.
[140:23.18]for me.
[140:25.45]Oh, so happy Halloween-ish, I guess?
[140:29.86]Oh, that's right.
[140:31.06]It's Spooky Month.
[140:33.72]It's Spooky Month.
[140:35.92]We started Spooktober with Spooky Month, and we have ghost activity, except it wasn't a poltergeist, but that's okay.
[140:45.91]we should do this again I agree when the game is a little bit more worked on as well like apparently the updates are frequent so that's good that's cool it seems pretty good I mean I didn't think there was going to be any actual monsters that like attacked you but I very clearly I saw like at least once or twice very clear monsters yeah you saw a skeleton we died blood skeleton dude yeah we died super hard what does that say that barrel what does that say
[141:15.93]Oh... Coke?
[141:16.77]Coq?
[141:18.45]Coq-leo oil?
[141:19.89]Oh.
[141:21.35]Coq-leo oil.
[141:23.02]Coq-leo oil.
[141:24.58]Garber oil.
[141:25.88]Gotcha.
[141:27.38]Oh.
[141:28.20]Alright.
[141:28.60]Gotcha.
[141:29.10]Well, that was fun.
[141:30.55]Uh... Yeah.
[141:33.67]It was good.
[141:34.45]Let's do something again sometime.
[141:36.57]Yes, absolutely.
[141:37.61]Actually, it was pretty fun.
[141:39.09]I had actually a really good time.
[141:40.03]That was pretty scary.
[141:41.51]It was good.
[141:42.01]I was actually mega spooked.
[141:43.84]In VR, it was really good.
[141:45.44]If you ever get your VR fixed, Jerma, we got to do this again because I think you'll have a good... It's different in VR.
[141:50.26]It's very different.
[141:51.34]It hits different, as they say.
[141:52.68]Yeah.
[141:54.86]I'll get it working.
[141:55.42]All right.
[141:57.76]Peace out, guys.
[141:58.38]Thanks for joining me, and thank you for having me as a part of this team.
[142:01.72]We'll ghost hunt more, and we'll buy some flashlights next time.
[142:05.02]Cheers.
[142:05.60]Lots of flashlights.
[142:06.80]Okay, bye guys.
[142:09.06]I'm gonna quickly go talk to my stream.
[142:12.07]Okay, me too.
[142:12.89]Goodbye.
[142:14.03]Later.
[142:16.75]I'm gonna leak the fucking lobby.
[142:18.11]Anybody have this game?
[142:26.28]What if I just leak the lobby right now and then bailed?
[142:33.33]Almost 10k people watching right now.
[142:37.01]There's bound to be somebody that's going to come in and start blowing eardrum music.
[142:43.56]That's a bad idea.
[142:44.36]That's a very bad idea.
[142:46.72]Very bad idea.
[142:47.80]Very bad idea.
[142:52.86]But, yeah, I knew this wasn't going to be a very long stream.
[142:54.73]I'm going to hang out for a little bit, though.
[142:56.65]Because we'll talk about FTK for a little bit.
[143:00.13]Just really wanted to play something with Vinny.
[143:01.79]I know those two were also really fun to play with, so... Vinny and I have been talking about trying to do something for a very, very long time, so... I thought that was actually pretty fun.
[143:09.99]When are you going to do Chubby Bunny?
[143:13.55]Not... I'm not doing... I'm not doing Chubby Bunny right now.
[143:16.93]Do you want to loan?
[143:17.71]Do you want to loan?
[143:30.50]Oh, I don't fucking want to do this alone.
[143:40.40]Yo, let me join.
[143:41.60]No.
[143:47.07]Dirty water.
[143:48.61]Dirty water in the sink.
[143:49.99]I just want to get a picture of the sink.
[143:59.85]Oh.
[144:04.19]Key on table, key on table, got it.
[144:07.89]Whoops, that's a... Ah, one down!
[144:09.94]One down!
[144:19.76]Oh, I don't like playing this alone.
[144:21.08]It's so much better to play this with other people, because then you can just, like, bounce off of them and you're not scared as much.
[144:26.75]This is really scary now that I'm doing this alone.
[144:48.63]Scare Thursday.
[144:49.91]Hear that?
[144:56.32]What's that?
[145:10.63]Somebody's phone just vibrated.
[145:13.09]Was that... Somebody's phone just vibrated.
[145:24.00]That wasn't me, right?
[145:26.52]What about the sink?
[145:27.16]Where's the sink?
[145:27.64]Okay, got a sink.
[145:39.99]I'm just gonna take a picture of every sink in the house.
[145:42.07]Turn on the sink.
[145:56.90]Turn on, turn the water on.
[146:01.87]I can't.
[146:05.09]I can't turn the water on.
[146:14.13]I just got a photo of him and it didn't do anything!
[146:26.58]That guy was like a butcher!
[146:28.83]Was I too slow?
[146:29.53]It was too slow.
[146:41.96]That was actually- that was fucking scary.
[146:51.85]We didn't see that once!
[146:54.31]It's because I'm the only person here, so he's just like camping me.
[146:58.91]I get it.
[146:59.23]Yeah, because there's not four people to walk around for him to fuck with.
[147:10.11]I can't believe I didn't get him.
[147:11.48]Not even like an arm.
[147:18.24]Even scarier.
[147:18.98]Yeah, it's way scarier alone.
[147:24.92]There's nobody, like, telling jokes in my ear.
[147:28.65]I gotta get a photo of this guy, though.
[147:30.11]I, like, have to.
[147:39.95]Joseph Brown- I don't even know the guy's name.
[147:50.37]Mike?
[147:50.97]Nope, not that one.
[148:03.07]Charlie Brown Charlie Brown I'm sorry that Lucy used to rip the football underneath you when you tried to kick the football and you got really mad about it That was a long time ago
[148:33.11]I thought that was just him hanging outside the window.
[148:37.96]This is cool.
[148:38.46]This game is fucking cool.
[148:40.54]I'm just, like, realizing this is a cool game.
[148:43.54]It's been, like, two and a half hours.
[148:44.76]I'm just realizing now this is pretty fun.
[148:54.69]Oh, shit.
[148:55.07]Alright, get a photo.
[148:55.71]Photo, photo, photo.
[148:56.41]A good one.
[148:57.31]And then I'm gonna turn the stream off.
[149:04.92]I've been waiting for years for a ghost hunting game.
[149:10.75]This is probably the one.
[149:11.69]Did I turn the lights off?
[149:21.01]No, he was over here.
[149:21.81]He was in this room here.
[149:30.79]Freaked out when I... Yep.
[149:32.11]Okay, here we go.
[149:33.73]Is this teddy bear or something?
[149:36.66]Here we go, here we go, here we go.
[149:37.87]I'm gonna get it, I gotta get it.
[149:42.58]Charlie Brown.
[149:45.03]Enough is enough.
[150:33.99]Cold.
[150:34.51]Cold.
[150:34.71]There he is.
[150:36.57]Come on in.
[150:36.99]Come on.
[150:38.39]Come on.
[150:38.69]Right in the lens.

[150:41.35]Let's go.
[150:42.67]Come on.
[150:43.09]Right in the lens.
[150:43.59]Let's go.

[152:18.36]Are you friendly?
[152:22.96]How old are you?
[152:23.88]I need the radio, shit.
[152:41.35]Oh, this game sucks with one person.
[152:45.87]It's silent, I can hear every creak.
[153:02.42]What?
[153:04.98]I heard a vibrate.
[153:06.20]I heard a vibrate.
[153:06.80]I heard a vibrate.
[153:07.46]I heard a vibrate.
[153:08.68]He's here.
[153:09.54]He's here.
[153:09.97]He's here.
[153:10.39]He's here.
[153:10.91]He's here.
[153:11.45]He's here.
[153:11.85]He's here.
[153:12.19]He's right here.

[153:59.73]Just one.
[154:02.08]That was fun.
[154:02.60]I can't find him.
[154:03.12]I don't know where he is.
[154:04.28]He jumped scared, ran at me, and then he just disappeared.
[154:06.74]Now he's scared.
[154:07.26]He won't come back out.
[154:09.62]And I want somebody to take that footage.
[154:11.70]I want you to slow it down.
[154:14.42]When I went like... I want you to frame by frame.
[154:23.42]He's not coming out.
[154:24.00]He's scared.
[154:25.17]I scared him away with a flash.
[154:37.45]Okay.
[154:59.67]He's a... Holy shit.
[155:02.57]I heard a door open.
[155:03.21]Get him.
[155:13.84]What is he?
[155:17.08]I'm leaving.
[155:17.40]I'm leaving.
[155:17.74]I'm leaving.
[155:18.06]I'm leaving.
[155:18.40]I'm leaving.
[155:19.12]I'm leaving.
[155:20.72]I'm leaving.
[155:37.24]Bye.
[155:37.62]I'm out.
[155:37.86]I don't care.
[155:40.12]Alright, he was frozen breath.
[155:42.58]He had a, um... He had a, he was, he looked like a butcher.
[155:51.65]Alright, I got it.
[155:55.31]Frozen breath.
[155:57.91]He talked to me and looked at me and shit.
[156:08.27]That's a mayor.
[156:11.51]Close it up.
[156:18.67]That's a horse!
[156:19.57]I got 20 bucks for those photos?
[156:41.63]That's the most money that we've seen all game.
[156:51.26]Shit.
[156:55.58]He's not in one of these, is he?
[156:56.70]I don't know.
[157:14.81]Phantom disappears in photos.
[157:17.31]Right.
[157:22.82]Phantom literally disappears and fucks off if you take a photo.
[157:29.88]Alright, I'm out of here.
[157:33.82]No, no more, no more.
[157:39.43]Let's talk about FTK for a second.
[157:42.43]I can just sit here.
[157:43.94]So, as you know, on Saturday, FTK is going to come back.
[157:48.45]What that means, I'm looking right at you.
[157:50.27]I see the chat.
[157:51.07]The chat is going fucking crazy right now.
[157:53.55]I can see you.
[157:54.21]Wow.
[157:54.97]This chat's going so fast, I can't even fucking talk.
[157:58.94]No.
[157:59.82]FTK is coming back on Saturday.
[158:02.07]Still trying to figure out exactly how we're going to do some of these systems because I know I told you guys that it was going to be a whitelisting system.
[158:08.68]You just need to be an active sub.
[158:10.96]And I think that's still going to be the case.
[158:13.68]There's a really, really simple UI that these guys have made where just in the game when you connect to the server, you're just going to check to see if you're a sub.
[158:20.62]Just an active sub.
[158:22.24]It just actually goes to Twitch's API and goes, oh, you are?
[158:25.26]Okay, you're good.
[158:26.76]But because I've delayed it like an extra three weeks...
[158:31.58]I don't, I don't know.
[158:32.60]I'm trying to still figure out what I want to do about it.
[158:37.91]Because I said that like a month ago.
[158:40.57]Oh, you just, just, just be subbed to the channel.
[158:43.29]You just have to be subbed.
[158:44.15]And then it didn't happen for like a month.
[158:45.35]So I, I don't know.
[158:47.29]I feel bad that people may have subbed for that.
[158:50.01]And then now they didn't, they're not subbed anymore.
[158:52.85]And they're just like, oh, well, thanks, dude.
[158:55.87]Like I was subbed to your channel for like a month or two.
[158:58.75]And I thought I was supposed to do that.
[159:00.07]So I'm trying to figure out what I want to do.
[159:03.21]Obviously, the last three or four weeks have been a little hectic, a little odd.
[159:09.77]Some stuff happened that I wasn't really necessarily ready and prepared to do.
[159:15.18]But I'm going to find out.
[159:17.40]We're going to figure that out.
[159:20.00]I got a 300-word essay.
[159:21.10]I just subbed for that thing.
[159:27.05]But it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[159:27.97]It's not what you think it is.
[159:29.43]It's not just run around the server with an arrow and a bow and shoot at the guy.
[159:33.87]It's gonna be a very elaborate stream.
[159:35.57]There's gonna be way more servers this time.
[159:37.97]It's not just gonna be one that everybody just dumps onto.
[159:41.59]There's gonna be a whole hub system where if you die, or if you initially join, you go to this little hub server, which is like a bunch of servers connected to each other.
[159:51.70]So you can hang out in there and just chill out and you'll get pulled in, in a first come first- first come first serve basis.
[159:59.70]I gotta run advertisements... like right now? No. On FTK? No. I don't- I don't- why would I do that?
[160:13.70]Drop the IP.
[160:16.35]What's gonna happen here, is over the next few days-
[160:20.35]If you're not part of the Discord, I would really highly recommend you become part of the Discord.
[160:25.35]Because there's going to be a lot of info put in there.
[160:28.35]The actual IP for the server, the actual website, it's not on yet and they're not going to turn it on until probably a day or two before.
[160:35.35]So keep an eye on that Discord, I'm going to be in the general chat over the next couple days and you're going to get everything you need.
[160:41.35]I'm permabanned from your Discord - well why did you act like such a bad bad boy?
[160:47.91]You got- What do you mean I got permabanned from the Discord?
[160:52.11]What did you do?
[160:52.74]Discord.gov
[160:58.62]Stop.
[160:59.00]Don't be so... Watch your mouth.
[161:03.34]Your mother uses that computer too, you know.
[161:09.86]Permabanned him from Twitch too.
[161:11.13]Just to complete the circle.
[161:14.83]But... That's probably going to be...
[161:19.26]Tomorrow night into Friday morning.
[161:21.90]I'm not going to be streaming the next two days because I want to really get on this ball and make sure this goes smoothly.
[161:26.50]Saturday's the next time I'm going to turn the stream on.
[161:27.97]3 p.m.
[161:30.07]Pacific on Saturday.
[161:31.91]3 p.m.
[161:34.31]That's when it's happening.
[161:35.11]That's when the stream's going to turn on.
[161:36.21]That's when I'm going to start.
[161:37.49]There's specific events.
[161:38.99]I'll look at you here.
[161:39.87]I don't need to look at you down here.
[161:41.13]You're right there.
[161:41.67]I'm looking at you.
[161:42.19]There's going to be like three or four specific events that this stream's going to entail, so it'll be a lot of fun.
[161:48.93]I'm not going to tell you what those events are, because why would I do that?
[161:53.54]Spoilers, and I'm not going to spoil anything for you, so why would I do that?
[162:00.86]I feel uncomfortable when you look at the camera.
[162:04.00]Yeah, I'm looking at the chat right here.
[162:06.27]No, it's getting late.
[162:11.09]Minecraft 1.8.
[162:18.05]1.8.9 or 1.8.8.
[162:18.19]I'll get the exact details.
[162:23.36]But it'll be much more stable.
[162:25.86]There'll be much more to do.
[162:28.32]They were working on this for a long time, and it shows.
[162:31.04]And the server's going to stay up, by the way, after this.
[162:34.04]I'm not just going to turn it off.
[162:35.68]Anybody that did not get to participate in the events of the stream are going to be able to participate whenever they want for about a month after the stream turns off.
[162:45.37]So you guys can just join it.
[162:46.71]You can play it.
[162:48.01]Do all the activities whenever you want.
[162:51.41]So, for those of you that didn't get a chance to play it on stream.
[162:53.89]And there's going to be a lot of you.
[162:55.74]Because I think there's only about 300 or 400 people can be in the game server.
[163:00.14]I believe thousands of people can be connected to the hub server.
[163:03.88]But in the actual game server, only a few hundred at a time.
[163:13.53]I lost my sub.
[163:14.29]Feels bad, man.
[163:15.11]Yeah, let me see what I want to do about that.
[163:19.17]I feel shitty.
[163:21.67]Telling people to sub.
[163:22.71]Oh yeah, sub through 50k.
[163:24.99]Sorry, didn't happen.
[163:26.39]I'll see you next month.
[163:27.73]Oh, you didn't want to sub again?
[163:29.66]Tough shit.
[163:31.34]I don't want to do that.
[163:33.40]We'll see if there's a solution.
[163:40.12]I'm looking forward to it, though.
[163:42.53]So you'll see the stream turn on again for FTK, but before that, join the Discord.
[163:46.12]I'll be in the general.
[163:48.44]The mods will be talking about it too.
[163:50.82]You will know.
[163:51.52]We just got a bunch of community.
[163:52.32]We got a lot of stuff, but... There was a lot of subs and shit today.
[163:56.34]But because of the nature of the game, I didn't kind of just want to talk over everybody and... Like... Oh, hey!
[164:02.54]Thanks for the fucking... Thanks for the subs!
[164:04.02]Hey, hey, thanks for... Oh, wait, wait, hey!
[164:05.26]Where's the ghost?! !
[164:06.70]I don't want to.
[164:07.40]There was like four of us.
[164:08.98]I want to kind of clear the air there.
[164:11.03]But that's a lot of money.
[164:14.53]Oh, shit.
[164:16.15]I missed a raid too, didn't I?
[164:18.03]Boxbox raided.
[164:20.65]Long time ago.
[164:21.35]Boxbox.
[164:22.13]If you guys came from Boxbox, thank you.
[164:23.53]Boxbox is awesome.
[164:25.25]Really appreciate that.
[164:26.09]I missed it.
[164:27.35]I was very engrossed.
[164:31.21]Thank you, Boxbox.
[164:32.05]If any of you guys are still here from there, thank you.
[164:33.79]I really appreciate that.
[164:36.84]Sorry I missed it earlier.
[164:37.72]I don't know how I did.
[164:38.40]I just get sucked in sometimes.
[164:40.81]Edmund Hakari, thanks for the 10 subs.
[164:43.23]StormGC10, thanks for the 10 subs.
[164:47.45]$100 from FS Woods.
[164:48.55]Holy fuck, I'm so happy you got a haircut.
[164:50.13]You look like a human now.
[164:52.16]I need another one.
[164:54.48]I need another haircut.
[164:56.06]I've also gained about 12 pounds.
[164:58.18]Like, let me be real about that too.
[165:00.64]Since the last time you saw me on camera, I was looking a little gaunt.
[165:06.82]I've gained about 12 pounds in the last, like, two months.
[165:10.99]Three months.
[165:13.07]If you remember the green screen stream, I was looking a little thin.
[165:18.67]There was a bunch of shit that was going on.
[165:21.01]It was hard to keep my appetite up.
[165:23.39]I was trying.
[165:25.73]But I'm back up to kind of where I was before, which I'm happy about.
[165:31.82]Big healthy boy.
[165:34.91]I'm not quite at my target yet.
[165:36.87]Getting there, though.
[165:39.29]Gotta do what you gotta do.
[165:41.09]Thank you, FS Woods.
[165:41.81]Thanks for the hundred bucks.
[165:42.55]Thank you, AjaxTheMediocre for the five subs.
[165:46.38]Shibiru for the five community subs.
[165:50.52]FreddyDread gave $300, and I think it was like a little while ago, and I missed it.
[165:58.15]That's 30,000 bits.
[166:00.16]That's too many bits to give Freddy Dredd.
[166:02.84]Freddy Dredd with $300 in bits.
[166:06.26]That is an extreme amount of money.
[166:11.50]And not to talk about phylactery lich, decided to give 69 community subs, which is also an extreme amount of fucking money.
[166:17.56]That's 69 subs.
[166:21.20]Insane.
[166:23.24]Both of you are insane.
[166:24.10]Insane.
[166:26.89]Listen to Freddy.
[166:28.37]He said, Jerma, I'm scared.
[166:32.29]Good.
[166:33.91]But thanks, guys.
[166:36.06]Oiki, 10 subs.
[166:36.88]Stormy2, 5 subs.
[166:38.42]Itsasky, 5 subs.
[166:39.66]Snarbosis, 10 subs.
[166:41.06]Destroydude, 5 subs.
[166:42.70]And then Thragnell, 20 community fucking subs.
[166:46.42]Right now.
[166:48.70]It's a storm.
[166:51.87]Oh, thank you guys.
[166:52.55]Seriously, you guys shower this channel with so much money.
[166:56.86]Almost at the end of the Powerade.
[166:57.82]Perfect timing.
[167:01.06]Thanks a lot.
[167:04.28]Dream with Freddy Dredd.
[167:08.33]If you want to fucking play, like, Scrabble or something, Freddy.
[167:13.43]I have an open invitation to Freddy, by the way, for a Las Vegas Denny's Steak Dinner.
[167:19.59]Hope it settles down.
[167:22.07]Out here.
[167:23.98]Denny's Steak Powerade Dinner.
[167:32.54]Purple Powerade is the only Powerade I like.
[167:33.88]And it's way better than Gatorade.
[167:35.66]It's way more flavorful.
[167:38.68]But that's where this is going to end.
[167:41.36]I will see you guys on Saturday for FTK.
[167:43.78]Hop in the Discord.
[167:44.62]I will be around over the next few days.
[167:45.98]Give you more details.
[167:46.66]Five subs from Johnny Boy.
[167:50.08]Thank you, Johnny Boy.
[167:50.74]Right at the end.
[167:52.48]So let's move over here.
[167:53.38]Let's see the credits.
[167:54.02]Let's show all these subs.
[167:54.92]There are a lot of them.
[167:57.12]And I'm really happy to do something with Vinny.
[168:01.72]Vinny's awesome.
[168:02.28]Ross is awesome, too.
[168:04.18]That's the first time I've ever had an experience at all with Ross.
[168:07.62]A swell guy.
[168:09.04]And Giwi, too.
[168:11.13]Great players.
[168:13.21]Sometimes, you know, when you're in a group of people that's more than three or four, you don't really know what to expect because... Oh, shit.
[168:22.53]That felt pretty comfortable.
[168:24.25]That felt very comfortable.
[168:27.57]I had a lot of fun.
[168:36.67]The first 30 minutes or so, we were really trying to set stuff up, but... Great.
[168:41.68]I had a... Look, this is going to be just a late-night hangout stream.
[168:46.64]I'm glad we got to do it.
[168:47.46]So, thanks for watching.
[168:53.44]A little tired on this eye.
[168:54.96]Only on this eye, though.
[168:58.72]I still can't... Dude, I was... You have no idea.
[169:00.78]I was sitting here, just seething in rage over the...
[169:10.82]Did you see it?
[169:12.00]You didn't see it, right?
[169:14.08]Which finger did I use?
[169:18.14]I used this hand, right?
[169:21.00]I didn't use this hand, did I?
[169:32.07]I used the gross hand.
[169:39.71]I did, didn't I?
[169:45.39]Alright, I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[169:47.25]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[169:50.76]Show us.
[169:51.20]No, that's disgusting, guys.
[169:53.38]I'm not going to just show you that.
[169:54.70]I'm getting rid of it.
[169:59.68]Guns up.
[170:06.04]Yeah, my VR is fucked up.
[170:07.34]I spent all day trying to fix it.
[170:09.31]I have no idea what the hell is going on.
[170:11.15]A lot of people were trying to help earlier.
[170:12.41]I was just so angry sitting in this chair.
[170:15.54]Up until, I'll be honest, up until, like, Vinny got in the call, I was insanely angry about my VR not working.
[170:23.56]I was just sitting there going, like, stupid fucking VR.
[170:27.52]VR sucks.
[170:29.16]Everything sucks.
[170:29.84]This is stupid.
[170:31.98]Why does my computer suck?
[170:36.68]And then, like, I started the stream, and it's like, okay, here we are.
[170:40.32]And Vinny cheered me up.
[170:41.68]So did Ross and Kiwi as well.
[170:43.24]So I feel a lot better.
[170:44.10]It was a lot of fun.
[170:49.07]The second I heard the video fire alarm I was like, I don't even care if it's not VR.
[171:02.79]That was insane by the way.
[171:04.17]I really wonder what that actually was.
[171:06.33]I can still hear it.
[171:16.46]Yeah, I kinda can.
[171:21.29]Yeah, how are there this many subs?
[171:29.54]The stream is only like two and a half hours.
[171:30.92]How is it this many people subbed?
[171:34.00]This is a shitload of people still.
[171:36.94]Even over two hours.
[171:48.25]Alright, we are going to end... Tonight... of... We're gonna raid Vinny.
[171:55.53]Because, I mean, obviously we were just playing with him, so let's just go raid him.
[171:58.41]Because I'm turning the stream off.
[172:08.45]What is he doing right now?
[172:09.83]Legend of Zelda?
[172:15.19]Zelda Oracle of Ages.
[172:19.06]Go say hello to Vinny.
[172:19.84]I mean, you just saw him, but... A wave.
[172:25.59]He's still gone.
[172:28.73]I will see you guys on Saturday for FTK.
[172:32.27]Good night.
[172:32.97]Goodbye.
[172:33.95]Take care of yourselves.
[172:35.85]Thanks for watching.
[172:36.61]Very, very late stream.
[172:38.32]Don't expect these very often.
[172:42.68]Take care, guys.
[172:44.12]Good night.
[172:54.24]Thank you.
[173:29.13]Thank you.
