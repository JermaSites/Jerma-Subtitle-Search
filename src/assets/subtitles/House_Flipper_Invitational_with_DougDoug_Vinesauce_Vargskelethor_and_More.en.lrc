[ve:60.16.100]

[00:26.97]Hello, everybody.
[00:27.63]I already have my chat open.
[00:30.73]Hold on, let me do that.
[00:31.41]Let me fix that.
[00:39.82]That is a useful thing to have open.
[00:43.22]Welcome to the House Flipper unofficial invitational.
[00:49.07]How you doing?
[00:53.45]Give me one second while I do this.
[00:58.17]There are 10 people here.
[01:04.16]It's weird to talk in chat and not be in chat.
[01:07.02]Hold on.
[01:10.00]I gotta tweet it.
[01:10.96]I gotta tweet it.
[01:11.42]Give me a second.
[01:31.45]The House Flipper of... No, this is unofficial.
[01:34.86]There's no, uh... This is only... only my invitational.
[01:40.62]If you're wondering, I asked a bunch of my friends, a couple other streamer colleagues, to come into the stream, spend 75 minutes at the same time with the same house, and see who makes the best house.
[01:56.49]Graded on five categories.
[01:59.83]Well, four categories.
[02:03.68]You guys will get the last grade.
[02:08.91]Everybody should be getting started with their streams.
[02:13.07]We want to make sure everyone's ready to go.
[02:14.43]Okay.
[02:17.33]There we go.
[02:19.81]Who's here?
[02:20.73]We will introduce them in just one second.
[02:24.20]How much time do they get?
[02:25.88]75 minutes.
[02:28.62]Are you playing Final Fantasy today?
[02:30.18]What?
[02:31.34]Not today.
[02:31.72]Okay.
[02:37.76]Yeah, we're gonna play Final Fantasy in five minutes.
[02:39.86]No.
[02:43.07]Alright.
[02:45.65]I think we can get the crew here.
[02:48.85]Let's see if everybody's here.
[02:51.33]Hello?
[02:51.81]Is anybody here?
[02:54.60]Hello, Mr. J. Well, that's a mod.
[03:00.08]Alright.
[03:01.04]Is everybody here?
[03:02.02]I'm live right now, so if anybody wants to pop in.
[03:06.37]Hello?
[03:07.62]Hi.
[03:10.40]Yeah, we got Moz in here.
[03:13.00]Everybody unmute.
[03:14.96]Yeah, yeah.
[03:15.24]Hello.
[03:16.16]Hello.
[03:16.98]Hello.
[03:17.36]How is it going, folks?
[03:19.16]What's up?
[03:20.50]Should I ping the other streamers to unmute?
[03:22.88]I would say so.
[03:25.17]Roger that.
[03:25.85]No, just start the clock for them.
[03:28.49]And it's 75 minutes.
[03:29.09]Starts right now.
[03:32.61]No, no, no, no, no.
[03:33.19]I'm just kidding.
[03:33.83]I'm kidding.
[03:34.51]I'm kidding.
[03:36.43]Oh, that's right.
[03:36.99]That's right.
[03:37.33]That's right.
[03:38.03]I had a heart attack too.
[03:40.41]Alright.
[03:41.79]Once everybody's here.
[03:42.47]Are we unmuted?
[03:43.84]Yeah, you can unmute.
[03:44.56]You can undefin everything.
[03:47.04]We're going to go over it real quickly.
[03:48.82]And I'm very curious.
[03:50.38]I want to get a little bit of a temperature check from all of you.
[03:53.53]We're going to introduce every single person.
[03:57.53]Each person gets 15 minutes to introduce themselves.
[04:00.64]Should take us about two or three hours to get through the initial intros here.
[04:04.00]Cool.
[04:06.54]Glad I have this full PowerPoint presentation to introduce you to me.
[04:12.35]Alright.
[04:13.23]So.
[04:14.99]welcome ladies and gentlemen to the House Flipper of unofficial invitational what you see on my screen right now is the house that all of these streamers are going to have to turn into a beautiful home in 75 minutes the timer is on my stream I would be aware that streamers
[04:35.82]you need to know it's 75 minutes hour and 15 from when I count down well let's introduce who's here first and by the way you get literally like a five second introduction so let's start whoever wants to go first go ahead just go I'm Vinny hi that's all that's all I need oh he nailed it he got it well I was I thought we were gonna hear a shitload of people just start like yelling does he get points for that does he get graded
[05:02.76]Yep, I think so.
[05:03.78]That was some good philosophy.
[05:05.38]That was pretty good philosophy, that's right.
[05:12.36]No, no!
[05:15.24]CDawg, what time is it where you are right now?
[05:18.36]Well, it's 5.12am and I woke up at 4.30am for this.
[05:22.81]So I hope that goes into the kind judging considerations.
[05:27.84]at an inconvenient time.
[05:29.26]I'm on peak performance.
[05:33.78]But yeah, so each... I'll just go through it.
[05:36.07]Connery's Pants, CDawg, Kriken, DougDoug, Etalyx, Ludwig, RTGame, Joel, I almost just said Trotter, but you're a mod, and VinesauceVinny.
[05:53.84]These are your... We did it in alphabetical order.
[05:55.14]We did it in alphabetical order.
[05:57.73]Yeah.
[05:57.99]It's the roll call attendance done for the class.
[06:00.57]That's the attendance.
[06:01.99]Ladies and gentlemen.
[06:02.83]And I'm me.
[06:03.61]You're up for Jerma985.
[06:04.91]Yeah.
[06:07.06]Yeah.
[06:08.70]Where's Ster?
[06:09.30]I don't know.
[06:10.84]He's not here.
[06:14.02]He might just show up and just jump in the call later.
[06:16.24]He has no pressure to be here, by the way.
[06:18.50]It's a content creator stream, and we're less than 15 minutes late.
[06:21.50]That is a crowning achievement.
[06:22.92]That is a crowning achievement.
[06:23.88]Yeah, that's true.
[06:25.66]That's true.
[06:26.08]The sheer fact that Miracle were all actually here at the same time is quite shocking.
[06:30.33]I'm just going to tell you guys this.
[06:32.69]When Jerma presented this idea to us, and I'm going to go full in for this, alright?
[06:37.43]Because it's going to be, like, my part of this is going to be crap.
[06:40.49]But I get into this call, and I'm expecting everybody's got their stuff lined up so good.
[06:45.52]And I realize none of these guys have booted up the game.
[06:48.00]Yeah.
[06:49.72]So, I have a good chance of maybe making it into the bottom five, you know?
[06:55.95]You got this, Joel.
[06:56.71]I believe in you.
[06:57.69]Joel, I think you might be the favorite.
[07:00.65]It's possible you're the favorite.
[07:01.45]Joel, I hope you crash and burn.
[07:02.87]Joel showed us his secret, and it is
[07:05.08]way better than anything I've seen.
[07:06.56]It's quite potent.
[07:07.28]I think we have aversely.
[07:09.32]I missed a lecture about the walls, so I don't know how to make walls.
[07:14.38]I will figure that part out.
[07:16.96]He woke up, it's 5am, he's like, what the fuck does Jerma want me to do?
[07:20.59]He wants me to build a house?
[07:22.17]What are the tools in this game?
[07:23.23]I come in, he's telling me about the technique, about how to build a wall.
[07:26.23]You're gonna scroll at a good pace.
[07:28.67]Make sure you're five pixels away from the wall or the wall won't build.
[07:31.92]And I'm like, wait, which tool is this?
[07:33.38]Well, I'll figure it out.
[07:34.57]yeah it's by the way this whole thing is horseshit none of this matters it's just give it away what there's no reason to stay yeah if you guys just all left right now like it would be fine like this there's no nobody wins anything nobody loses anything except I have to ask you Jerma I have to ask you this this might be a stupid question but are you wearing like a toupee or something yeah
[08:00.68]You look like, you look like, uh... No!
[08:02.56]I'm not wearing a toupee!
[08:03.66]This is my real fucking hair!
[08:05.58]You got a camera on?
[08:06.42]I'm on camera!
[08:07.43]You owe me buying Tony's shit.
[08:09.31]What happened?
[08:09.85]Does he look more professional or something?
[08:13.59]Take points away for that.
[08:15.07]Yeah, take points for copying Tony Starr.
[08:16.77]Thank you for bringing up points.
[08:18.05]Let's go over it real quickly.
[08:19.33]You are all going to be graded individually.
[08:21.86]You're gonna give me a tour through what?
[08:23.44]You don't like my presentation voice?
[08:26.28]Who just laughed?
[08:27.52]There's a lot of people in here.
[08:28.74]Who just laughed?
[08:31.84]It was the mods.
[08:32.42]I want a name.
[08:32.96]Was it a mod?
[08:34.93]You'll never figure out who it was with like streamer mode on.
[08:37.97]Okay.
[08:38.27]Sorry, Dermot.
[08:39.95]Which C name was it?
[08:41.41]Good luck.
[08:43.33]You are all going... Let me talk about what you're doing.
[08:46.38]Somebody just said Lego hair.
[08:48.40]Yeah, that's an old one.
[08:49.56]That one was of 2018.
[08:50.20]Alright.
[08:50.56]This is like a first trial run of this event.
[08:55.90]You guys are supposed to be my friends.
[09:01.53]We're listening, buddy.
[09:02.59]Go ahead.
[09:03.51]Keep it going, Jerma.
[09:04.21]Yeah, everybody give it up for Jerma.
[09:05.75]I'm here for you.
[09:06.35]Moment of silence for Jerma.
[09:07.84]You are all gone after 75 minutes, which, by the way, everybody here is streaming.
[09:13.06]So everybody has their streams going.
[09:15.26]You can jump around, go see what people are doing.
[09:18.00]Maybe one of them isn't, and then, you know, whatever.
[09:19.92]That's all good.
[09:20.54]Well, maybe two of them aren't.
[09:21.40]Three of them.
[09:21.74]Doesn't matter.
[09:22.81]But go check it out.
[09:23.65]You're going to be seeing their process.
[09:24.85]They'll be streaming it live.
[09:25.73]They're all on this house, and they're all going to be graded on five categories.
[09:28.61]Creativity is number one.
[09:29.91]It's worth 35% of your total grade.
[09:34.33]Creativity.
[09:35.40]Creatively bankrupt.
[09:36.80]Based on a 100 point scale, it's worth 35% of your total grade.
[09:38.94]Complexity and structure is your second grade.
[09:41.68]This is worth 25% of your total grade.
[09:52.08]How did you handle the walls?
[09:53.15]What does your interior wall structure look like?
[09:55.09]Did you do any additions?
[09:56.55]How does your yard look?
[09:57.83]Did you add anything in there?
[09:59.49]How does you yard look?
[10:01.53]How does you yard look?
[10:04.75]next one is cleanliness cleanliness is it worth 15 I see that over there somebody's putting an image of me it's worth cleanliness is worth 15 of your total grade so make sure look I mean look at this you got this kind of dirty it's kind of up you're gonna be graded on this 100 point scale maybe you get an effing clean but maybe you get an a plus in creativity use your time wisely the next grade there's more
[10:30.56]Philosophy is worth 15% of your total grade.
[10:34.07]What does philosophy mean?
[10:35.93]We'll find out because I don't know either.
[10:38.11]So we're going to figure that out as we go.
[10:40.33]The last grade is worth 10% and it is Chat's grade.
[10:44.15]The mods are going to put a poll in at the end of each person's individual tour.
[10:48.37]That will be a very simple A, B, C, D, or F. F is always 55 points.
[10:55.84]You can't go lower than 55 points.
[10:57.50]Do we have any questions?
[11:00.56]Have you revealed that you are going to build a real full-scale replica of the winning house yet?
[11:05.27]Like for the dollhouse too, this is the location.
[11:10.67]No, not yet, but that's a great idea.
[11:13.69]That's actually a fantastic idea.
[11:17.21]There's like grandmas on the left side of my screen.
[11:19.37]Is that alright?
[11:20.67]Okay, hit escape.
[11:22.13]Go to settings.
[11:23.47]Go to gameplay options and check the box that says, I don't want to hear from the people, the buyers.
[11:29.53]You should all do that.
[11:30.11]Oh, wait, I thought you were joking.
[11:32.15]Okay, can I ask, how many people, in my two page document that I sent you all four or five days ago, did you guys think I was making a joke?
[11:47.40]I read the whole thing.
[11:49.22]I thought it was more like light reading though.
[11:50.58]I thought I didn't realize it was functional.
[11:53.08]I thought it was a creative writing piece.
[11:55.48]I said you guys a two-page document with detailed instructions.
[12:00.03]I thought it was like an Isaac Asimov the foundation thing.
[12:04.51]Like it didn't actually have any bearing on real life.
[12:06.91]I don't understand the part where we have to eat a horse in preparation, but I'm not hungry anymore.
[12:12.29]I ate the horse.
[12:13.37]Ladies and gentlemen.
[12:14.06]I read it so I could figure out all the loopholes.
[12:17.46]Are we all ready?
[12:19.02]Oh, yes.
[12:19.50]Yes, sir.
[12:19.74]I don't catch that.
[12:20.20]I'm ready.
[12:20.46]Because you have 75 minutes as of the third.
[12:22.20]You're making me laugh.
[12:23.62]As of three, two, one.
[12:36.32]Okay, they all muted.
[12:38.42]They can't hear me anymore.
[12:40.18]I can hear you.
[12:40.94]That's not how muting works!
[12:42.38]What?
[12:42.54]What happened?
[12:43.24]I thought everyone was gone.
[12:44.62]Oh, hi.
[12:54.74]Alright, well, so they are on their own streams.
[12:57.00]I'm very curious what they do.
[12:58.80]In the meantime, I'm going to just kind of show you some things about House Flipper that, you know, we're just going to go take a look.
[13:03.74]Some of you might not have ever seen this game.
[13:05.94]Yeah, you should probably mute me because I'm just going to be like an annoying presenter this whole time.
[13:12.27]Somebody says Ludwig isn't streaming.
[13:16.53]So he's cheating.
[13:19.99]That's so funny.
[13:22.61]But anyways, alright, let's go.
[13:23.99]So I'm very curious about this.
[13:28.31]This was just something to do for fun.
[13:30.51]I never thought this was going to be like anything serious or anything, but this is going to be a good time.
[13:36.03]I'm very curious.
[13:36.83]I could go peek in and see what they're doing, but I'm going to leave that up to you, I think.
[13:43.76]I think I want, because I want to be very surprised.
[13:46.26]I don't think I want to see what they're doing.
[13:48.76]I think I want to be given a fully, completely secret tour.
[13:52.05]Because then I can get my real assessment on the grades.
[13:55.79]Because we have them here, and I'm ready to give them to each individual person.
[14:00.53]So let me do some stuff.
[14:02.01]Let me see what I can do.
[14:02.85]And who cares about my time?
[14:04.15]What the fuck do I care?
[14:08.27]I don't want to peek.
[14:11.10]So let's see.
[14:11.78]What do I want to do?
[14:13.26]I can just clean the yard and just hang out.
[14:16.65]I do want to ask this question of everybody that's streaming right now.
[14:20.07]Who is panicking the most right now?
[14:24.71]Right now, out of all the people that are doing this, who right now is like, I don't fucking know what's going on.
[14:29.11]Please somebody help me.
[14:34.72]I bet you it's all of them.
[14:36.36]Because they have to clean.
[14:37.06]Look at how fucking dirty the yard is.
[14:39.60]Hey, don't tell them this.
[14:41.04]I'm going to want to see back here too.
[14:47.05]Don't tell them that.
[14:50.23]What, you think that's worth 100%?
[14:50.91]You think that's with an A+, if you miss anything here?
[14:57.64]They're stream sniping each other?
[15:01.90]They really shouldn't be, but whatever.
[15:04.54]It doesn't fucking matter.
[15:07.52]I'm so curious, though.
[15:10.14]I wonder what they all do.
[15:16.43]They're stealing ideas from each other.
[15:17.87]It's so funny.
[15:22.79]I tried to give the... There's so many... It's so funny.
[15:27.18]So, I had, like, a two-page detailed document about, like, how things work and everything.
[15:32.22]And even I'm just sitting here going, wait, how the fuck do you build an addition?
[15:38.69]Oh, so, like, 20 minutes ago, I was in there explaining how to do an addition.
[15:42.93]Because I was like, wait a minute, why is this not working?
[15:45.51]Oh, that's right.
[15:46.01]You can't have anything on the other side.
[15:47.65]We were like troubleshooting with each other like 20 minutes ago.
[15:53.46]I didn't even tweet the stream.
[15:56.18]There's like 10 fucking streamers here.
[15:57.76]Give me a second.
[16:03.32]Hold on.
[16:06.86]I'm going to say live right now with
[16:14.46]The House Flipper.
[16:19.92]Speed build with streamers.
[16:26.59]It's not really a tournament.
[16:35.20]You're wasting time.
[16:36.34]I mean, the whole goal for the first hour of this stream on my end is to waste time.
[16:40.87]So, don't worry.
[16:42.09]The timer is for you and for them to know how much time they have left.
[16:44.93]Should I go in there?
[16:45.91]Should I, like, have the mods on mute?
[16:48.39]And have me just be like, you got 25 minutes left.
[16:52.29]It's a contest.
[16:52.91]It's not a tournament.
[16:53.55]It's a contest.
[16:54.33]Well, it's not even a contest.
[16:57.31]When you're in school, in, like, a science class, is it a contest with your fellow students?
[17:02.64]No.
[17:03.18]You just get individually graded.
[17:05.94]I don't want to give anybody an F, though.
[17:07.52]I feel like that would hurt somebody's feelings.
[17:09.12]Should I not give somebody an F?
[17:12.86]Budwig is bur- I don't want to know.
[17:14.16]I don't want to know what he's doing.
[17:23.03]Give them all Fs.
[17:24.15]They deserve it.
[17:29.57]They all should have Fs.
[17:36.02]Why is your camera off center?
[17:37.07]I don't know.
[17:39.11]Because I put it above this thing.
[17:41.39]Oh, because I'm leaning in.
[17:42.37]Okay, let me just... Live right now with the House Flipper speed build in unofficial invitational.
[17:53.84]Does it even matter if I tweet something?
[17:56.14]Like, there's probably like only 50 people that see this through Twitter.
[18:06.29]I was going to say the unofficial invitational.
[18:08.73]I got time.
[18:09.57]I like how I don't have to.
[18:10.93]This is great.
[18:12.77]We can just sit here and watch a clock for an hour and I don't have to do anything.
[18:16.02]This is perfect.
[18:17.64]I should do this more often.
[18:19.62]Because like I can hear in the other room, right?
[18:23.24]A streamer freaking out.
[18:24.98]Being like, how the fuck do I use this tool?
[18:27.42]What the fuck?
[18:27.88]This is this game.
[18:28.54]What's wrong with this game?
[18:29.46]Like I can't fucking pick this up.
[18:31.10]They didn't read the instructions.
[18:42.03]The birds are just chirping.
[18:43.73]Oh, this is nice.
[18:44.73]I feel great.
[18:45.31]I feel good right now.
[18:53.52]Alright, live right now with House Flipper.
[19:00.06]Unofficial.
[19:01.02]Invitational.
[19:01.74]With streamers.
[19:03.28]I could at every single person, couldn't I?
[19:05.08]Should I at every single person here?
[19:16.04]You should.
[19:16.42]Yeah.
[19:19.46]I'm going to spend an hour... I'm going to spend... My timer is making a tweet in an hour.
[19:32.83]Can I do it?
[19:33.49]Can I make... Can I tweet my own event within the time that the event is taking place?
[19:39.81]At... There's two of these people.
[19:42.77]I can't do it.
[19:43.55]I can't do it.
[19:43.95]I can't even look at it.
[19:44.72]I hate looking at this.
[19:50.05]It's in your title.
[19:51.74]What?
[19:52.84]What is my title?
[19:53.80]Oh, that's right.
[19:54.34]We're good.
[19:56.98]Okay, at... This is going to go over the character limit.
[20:03.12]At CDawg.
[20:06.13]At... Etalyx.
[20:13.23]Okay.
[20:14.69]At... Who else is here?
[20:17.53]At Ludwig.
[20:20.17]At... This is what people do?
[20:23.44]This is the longest tweet of all time?
[20:28.42]At people that aren't here?
[20:29.82]No, that's fucking stupid.
[20:34.42]At... No, I'm just... I'm doing it.
[20:41.44]There's too many characters.
[20:43.00]I can't even do it.
[20:47.71]Do you have Twitter Plus?
[20:48.89]I don't even know what that is.
[20:49.73]What is Twitter Plus?
[20:54.75]Is it Twitter Plus?
[20:57.03]Somebody said, are you stupid?
[21:00.82]Alright, I'll do it.
[21:03.54]I'll do it, I'll do it.
[21:08.53]Hold on.
[21:09.03]Let me stretch first.
[21:11.11]I swear to God, I actually need to... Hold on.
[21:12.73]I got a DM.
[21:21.59]Poke.
[21:25.91]Okay.
[21:26.53]Hold on.
[21:26.87]Hold on.
[21:27.53]Hold on.
[21:27.90]Hold on.
[21:28.34]Poke is in my DMs right now.
[21:29.98]Poke is, I think, on his way.
[21:36.14]Alright, I think Poke is on his way here.
[21:38.65]You got... You got an hour and five minutes.
[21:52.83]That's so funny.
[21:56.04]Add extra time for Poke?
[21:58.52]Well, it was 60 minutes, but we made it 75, so technically we did.
[22:06.97]Technically, we did.
[22:13.97]Yeah, we'll put Poke on the end.
[22:17.01]That's so funny.
[22:18.99]He said, it's not tomorrow?
[22:25.89]Focus on your tweet.
[22:26.98]Oh, my tweet, my tweet, my tweet.
[22:31.62]I fucking love Poke so much.
[22:34.42]Okay.
[22:35.68]What am I doing?
[22:36.04]What am I doing?
[22:37.22]Oh, at CDawg.
[22:39.52]At Etalyx.
[22:45.03]At... Okay, at DougDoug.
[22:57.14]They're going to get a notification and be like, why did Jerma just at me on Twitter?
[23:02.36]Oh, because he just now put the tweet up.
[23:06.95]Okay.
[23:10.94]Hey.
[23:11.54]At.
[23:12.16]At poke.
[23:13.66]At poke.
[23:15.90]Okay.
[23:18.40]At.
[23:20.56]At.
[23:22.63]Riken.
[23:27.09]At.
[23:30.33]Ludwig.
[23:35.84]At.
[23:38.03]Alright, RT.
[23:43.79]At... Vinny?
[23:48.99]I'm gonna at somebody twice.
[23:56.70]At... Joel?
[24:05.56]Uh, at Vinny Vinesauce or Vine?
[24:07.46]Yeah, at Vinesauce.
[24:11.39]Alright.
[24:12.45]I'm ready to put my tweet out for my big event.
[24:16.13]That's everybody, right?
[24:17.11]Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[24:20.05]Wait, I'm missing somebody.
[24:20.91]Who am I missing?
[24:23.81]No, no, no.
[24:24.09]There's one more.
[24:24.79]No, no.
[24:25.41]I got Connery's pants.
[24:26.15]No, I didn't.
[24:26.67]I thought I put him first.
[24:27.55]I put the other Conner.
[24:39.37]Okay, there it is.
[24:40.05]I'm ready to tweet it.
[24:43.87]You guys ready?
[24:44.63]Make sure you retweet it.
[24:47.85]Make sure you retweet this.
[24:53.28]Make sure I got everybody.
[24:53.88]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[24:54.26]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[24:54.56]There we go.
[24:55.16]Hey, look at that.
[24:55.90]I did it.
[24:56.20]Yeah!
[25:14.06]So anyways, if you don't know anything about House Flipper, those of you that have no idea what's going on, let me give you some quick education here.
[25:21.15]House Flipper is a game where you clean houses, you flip them, you add interior walls, like I can clean, try to make it look as nice as you can.
[25:36.19]Walls can come down.
[25:37.13]I hope this isn't loud.
[25:39.63]It probably will be.
[25:40.79]So I'm going to do this for a sec.
[25:43.62]I probably should have mentioned that to all the streamers that the... Actually, no, it's okay now.
[25:47.66]They probably patched it.
[25:51.06]You tagged the wrong Vinesauce.
[25:53.50]What?
[25:53.64]What do you mean?
[26:00.48]I did?
[26:01.01]I didn't.
[26:03.59]Great tweet.
[26:04.65]No, I didn't.
[26:05.09]I got it right.
[26:06.59]How are people doing?
[26:08.11]Who is in the lead, in your opinion?
[26:10.57]Who is like, wow, they know exactly what they're doing?
[26:22.72]I hate this tweet bit.
[26:23.84]I just did it.
[26:24.43]It's over.
[26:26.77]It's the entire Vinesauce team account.
[26:30.73]Well, it's alright.
[26:33.79]It's alright.
[26:34.11]Let me get back over here so I can see what people are doing.
[26:39.35]Okay, we're good.
[26:39.89]It technically is the wrong account.
[26:42.86]Oh, I'm sorry.
[26:43.34]Alright, so let me just give you a quick rundown.
[26:51.68]Everybody is doing what I'm doing right now.
[26:53.02]They're probably very far ahead of what I'm doing.
[26:55.12]I wonder how many people are just panicking, just sitting around biting their fingernails going, I don't know what the fuck is going on.
[26:59.48]I don't know what to do.
[27:00.98]I will show you.
[27:01.76]And I'm also here unmuted in case somebody has a question.
[27:05.18]It's very important.
[27:05.82]If somebody comes in here and is like, hey, dude, can you please help me?
[27:09.30]How do I do this again?
[27:10.17]I want to be able to be here to tell them.
[27:14.82]But House Flipper has many, many, many, many tools.
[27:19.13]Many things for you to do.
[27:21.11]For instance, I can paint the walls whatever color I want.
[27:23.95]I can take down pretty much any wall.
[27:28.24]You can do wallpaper.
[27:29.76]So let's just say for the instance this.
[27:32.13]Yeah.
[27:32.47]Like just panels.
[27:34.11]I know a lot of you know this already, but this might be people here that have no idea that are here from other people's streams, uh, so on and so forth.
[27:40.81]So I can, I have a question.
[27:42.92]Yep.
[27:43.64]Sorry.
[27:44.22]I scared the shit out of myself because you came in here and I scared the shit.
[27:46.68]You scared the shit out of me.
[27:47.74]Alright.
[27:49.02]Is there a way to like bar window?
[27:51.00]Like if I wanted like from the inside, like put bars on the windows, like actually put bars on the windows.
[27:57.80]Right, like, so someone, like, couldn't get out of the room.
[28:01.12]Like, through the window.
[28:02.42]Um, I don't think so.
[28:05.38]Oh, wait, can they hear you?
[28:08.02]I don't know.
[28:08.50]Yeah, they can.
[28:08.96]Yeah, they're lying to me.
[28:10.52]I don't think you can put bars on the windows.
[28:12.38]If you like bars on the windows, I would say you probably should leave the bars that are already on the windows.
[28:18.43]Okay.
[28:19.15]Okay, good to know.
[28:19.79]Yeah, I don't think you can put... You can sell the window.
[28:21.87]You can put a new window in.
[28:23.85]But I don't think you can put bars on it.
[28:26.50]Alright.
[28:27.36]I'll figure this out.
[28:28.00]Thank you.
[28:28.50]Yeah.
[28:30.04]What happened to your eyebrows?
[28:31.38]What do you mean?
[28:31.80]What's wrong with my eyebrows?
[28:36.57]I mean, my hair lightens up in the summer because I'm out in the sun.
[28:39.73]We're going to my garden, bro.
[28:41.83]They're gone.
[28:43.95]They're not.
[28:44.63]What are you talking about?
[28:45.35]What are you talking about?
[28:50.82]My eyebrows lighten up in the summer.
[28:54.74]My eyebrows are right here.
[29:03.27]This grass in Vegas.
[29:05.88]Well, I have sunflowers, which I'm supposed to give you an update on those today, but
[29:13.15]It's just not going to happen.
[29:14.01]I'm sorry.
[29:15.65]You have a unibrow?
[29:18.39]This isn't cheating to just ask you a question mid contest.
[29:22.23]No, no, no.
[29:22.79]You are, in fact, the second or third person who's done so.
[29:25.31]So, yeah.
[29:25.79]Thank God.
[29:26.35]What can I do for you?
[29:28.62]How do I fill in an existing hole in the house, like in the concrete foundation?
[29:33.30]Like there's just gaps in the walls and I want to put wall in there.
[29:36.08]okay so you are going to hold right click and you have build inlets or build uh walls and lintels okay I I see I see build lintels that's for like a lower wall is it yeah but lintels you can put up you can't put them down but you can build that build tool is how you cover up gaps okay but what what if it's like a garage door or something like that because I'm I'm trying to
[30:03.52]Okay, let me see.
[30:05.80]What I'm imagining is you want to replace the garage door, is what you're saying.
[30:09.30]You know, I found a solution.
[30:12.10]It's grand.
[30:13.72]Thank you so much.
[30:14.92]Thank you.
[30:15.64]You got it.
[30:17.14]Thank you.
[30:19.47]Tech support.
[30:20.69]I'm here for an hour to meet tech support.
[30:23.81]That's so funny, though.
[30:26.11]No help?
[30:26.75]No help.
[30:27.29]No help.
[30:27.71]You didn't help.
[30:28.27]Oh, I didn't help.
[30:29.07]That's fine.
[30:32.03]No help.
[30:39.88]Tech support.
[30:41.44]Time is actually ticking.
[30:42.68]I heard nervousness in that voice.
[30:45.35]Okay, let me make some stuff.
[30:55.32]Let me do the lawn.
[30:55.94]Alright, let's get the tree trunk.
[31:05.08]I'm gonna clean up.
[31:05.66]I'm gonna do a lawn.
[31:06.99]I think a lot of people are sleeping on the lawn.
[31:09.83]I tried to make that really clear.
[31:11.43]I did say, guys, the lawn is important.
[31:16.19]Look at the lawn, the lawn.
[31:17.75]Only one person asked about the lawn, and I'm not gonna tell you who.
[31:23.52]I did have one inquisitive response about the lawn.
[31:37.26]Should have read this syllabus.
[31:38.49]Yeah.
[31:45.90]Won't your own house impact grading?
[31:49.26]No, no, we're going to get tours.
[31:50.76]People are going to share through Discord or through potentially, if it doesn't work, I can just pull up their streams too.
[31:59.76]What about indoor lawns?
[32:01.14]I'm not telling anybody how to make anything.
[32:02.94]One of the theories was if people had fun doing this, if this was a fun time for everybody, is maybe expand it and do it again another time, now that people understand the format, and include themings that you have to go by.
[32:16.85]Especially with House Flipper 2.
[32:19.63]House Flipper 2 is going to be so much more elaborate than this that I feel like that could be a lot of fun stuff.
[32:27.35]I'm very interested.
[32:28.81]But if people like it, if people are like, yeah, that was really, really swell.
[32:32.10]I want to do that again.
[32:33.24]Then we can start to do things like, hey, this one is, the theme for this one is green.
[32:41.85]I'm going to give you three words, green.
[32:46.44]Um, like, bark and food.
[32:52.36]And that's it.
[32:53.54]Good luck.
[32:54.58]And see what people come up with.
[32:56.46]This one was more, I'm just going to let people go kind of wild with whatever they want to do.
[33:01.31]And I might just remove F. I feel like some, I feel like a couple people are going to be like, hey, man, I just had no idea what the fuck was going on.
[33:11.53]And I don't want to give him an F. Maybe I'll take away F.
[33:22.05]Bark.
[33:22.93]That's fair.
[33:23.95]Yeah, F is a little harsh, I think, but no F can ever be lower than 55 points.
[33:31.33]Just give it, just keep it.
[33:36.41]That's, no, you have to, that's spineless.
[33:38.99]What do you mean?
[33:42.01]Is it harsh?
[33:45.69]Don't hurt their feelings.
[33:47.99]I'm going to try not to.
[33:53.78]We're down to... They are down to... They've only got 53 minutes.
[34:04.97]It's unfair to the people that try.
[34:10.57]I'm gonna laugh my ass off.
[34:12.23]I'm gonna laugh my fucking ass off.
[34:13.75]If Poke shows up with, like, 20 minutes left, and just, like, fucking freaks out and gets in the game, and makes a banger of a house.
[34:21.78]Do you know what I mean?
[34:22.50]Like, I feel like that's possible.
[34:26.12]That's so funny.
[34:26.96]Alright, let's do some, let's cut some, uh, let's cut the grass.
[34:36.75]I don't even know if people know you have, there's a lawnmower.
[34:41.72]There's gonna be people picking up blades of grass by hand.
[34:57.80]Everybody is inside at this point?
[34:59.62]Okay, interesting.
[35:03.67]D won't be insulting.
[35:09.70]Put on some music.
[35:10.96]We could put some music on.
[35:11.82]I mean, we're just hanging out anyways.
[35:15.51]Put on, uh, I don't know, like Animal Crossing.
[35:18.81]It's the easy go-to.
[35:31.56]Ah.
[35:31.72]Nice.
[35:37.55]Only 51 minutes left.
[35:39.93]Oh, that's like, I got a long time to relax.
[35:49.62]I'll change F to 60.
[35:51.48]We'll make it a D. Yeah, we'll make it a D. If I was going to give an F, I'm just going to give a 60.
[36:01.55]There you go.
[36:03.77]The F just doesn't exist anymore.
[36:12.49]Play Hell's Kitchen music?
[36:14.15]Yeah, I'll do that when there's like five minutes left.
[36:17.59]When there's like five or ten minutes left, I'll play Hell's Kitchen music and just start yelling at people.
[36:22.79]Let's let them work.
[36:24.13]Let them actually try.
[36:25.74]I don't want to give pressure right now.
[36:39.30]I would sell this.
[36:46.55]Alright, Polk is here.
[36:48.39]Alright, let me give Polk some quick instructions.
[36:56.10]I said, Polk, hop on the call.
[37:09.81]I can give him a quick rundown.
[37:17.77]He's got... It's still 50 minutes.
[37:20.59]Look, I... These are individual grades, so I can know that... I can know the... Hey, hey, what's up?
[37:26.99]Hi.
[37:27.31]Hey, alright.
[37:28.32]We're live right now.
[37:29.40]There's currently 50 minutes left in the competition.
[37:32.36]We started with... Perfect.
[37:33.50]Yeah, we started with an hour.
[37:34.46]We went up to 75 minutes.
[37:36.46]So you're actually not that... You still got some time.
[37:39.82]Listen, I read it was tomorrow and I was at an aquarium.
[37:42.60]I'm home now.
[37:43.80]I'm here.
[37:44.76]Well, the aquarium probably sounds fucking awesome.
[37:47.46]It was great.
[37:48.22]It was great.
[37:49.42]I'm in the game.
[37:50.18]Everything ready?
[37:50.78]I'm ready to go.
[37:51.43]I don't want to take up any more of your time, but the house you need to open, you need to open.
[37:54.33]It's called Garden After the House Built.
[37:56.65]That's the house everybody's doing.
[37:57.66]That's the house you need to build.
[38:00.89]Okay, which one?
[38:01.57]So go to the laptop.
[38:02.67]Go to browser.
[38:04.05]Go to houses that you can buy.
[38:06.26]And make sure you've done the cheats to give yourself the half million dollars.
[38:08.80]You're going to scroll down.
[38:10.28]It's got a bunch of wooded windows.
[38:11.82]You're going to get in there.
[38:13.16]It's called Garden After House Built.
[38:16.12]Garden After House Built.
[38:17.56]That's the one right there.
[38:18.34]Say go now and get going.
[38:20.83]And you're only about 10 to 15 minutes behind.
[38:24.05]Alright.
[38:24.51]Going in now.
[38:25.59]Oh, hell yeah.
[38:26.03]Alright.
[38:26.39]Timer's gone.
[38:27.45]Good luck.
[38:28.05]Bye.
[38:33.84]alright good to see poke we got everybody now the aquarium well that sounds fun he's freaking out right now well if you see this and knowing that you you've lost potentially 25 30 minutes of time it's almost like what do I even do I just go through the windows
[39:06.72]Jerma, why weren't you invited?
[39:07.76]I tried to give a tutorial of how to build additions, but... I feel like... Okay, you know when a teacher... When a teacher explains something, and very clearly the whole class is quiet, and everyone's like... Alright, um... Can you show us again?
[39:35.79]It's just like, ah, shit.
[39:37.22]Nobody got that.
[39:38.38]Nobody got that.
[39:40.04]I have to do it again.
[39:41.54]Because there's very specific things you can't do with the addition builder.
[39:48.16]I wonder.
[39:50.50]This is House Flipper 1.
[39:51.38]House Flipper 2 is not out yet.
[39:52.24]Play Halls of Torment.
[39:59.77]I actually saw that.
[40:00.81]I wanted to play it.
[40:01.87]That's definitely on the list 100%.
[40:10.72]It's very pog.
[40:19.62]Joel thinks he's almost out of time.
[40:21.52]Let him think that.
[40:28.62]You're not almost out of time.
[40:30.28]The Hell's Kitchen music hasn't started.
[40:33.56]That's so fucking funny.
[40:37.65]I don't know if... Can we... Mods, can you undefin and unmute everybody for... Oh, no, no, just undefin everybody for a second.
[40:43.73]Don't unmute them.
[40:44.39]Just undefin them in here.
[40:45.83]Can we do that so I can tell them to time check?
[40:49.45]We cannot, okay?
[40:50.89]We can't.
[40:51.69]Okay, okay.
[40:53.62]Well... Sorry, everybody, but...
[41:04.17]We can only, okay, we can ping them.
[41:06.69]Yeah, maybe ping everybody and just say, hey, 45 minutes, 45 minute warning.
[41:13.50]This is going quick.
[41:14.64]Oh, this is, I'm excited.
[41:15.70]I'm so happy about this.
[41:16.88]I'm having fun.
[41:18.00]I'm having fun just like experiencing what I think I'm going to experience in 45 minutes.
[41:32.19]Come on, dig.
[41:33.39]I can't dig this one.
[41:34.09]Uh-oh.
[41:35.84]Is this a bug in this map?
[41:39.94]Are they all freaking out about this?
[41:51.29]Okay, there we go.
[41:53.93]Yeah, alert.
[41:55.01]45 minutes remaining.
[41:58.15]What about a time extension?
[42:00.75]We talked about a time extension.
[42:03.70]The one thing that's important about this whole stream here is everybody has to give a five to seven minute tour at the end of this.
[42:13.12]And I don't want to extend it too far because the people that, there's some people from EU, there's people with time constraints today.
[42:19.59]And I didn't want to be like, oh yeah, like, so this would be like a seven hour experience for all of you.
[42:32.15]think anybody even knows that you can do this see what I'm really looking forward to is somebody kind of thinking outside the box you know what would be outside the box keeping the whole house boarded up and making an incredible garden that's where you get creativity a plus for me don't tell them that though don't ever tell anybody that why is the game so dark uh because it's technically nighttime right now I don't know why
[43:02.93]I guess I could just reset it so you can see better.
[43:06.17]That's inside the box.
[43:07.53]No, that's outside the box because the house is inside.
[43:09.73]That would be outside the box.
[43:14.11]Let Poke build for an extra 15 minutes.
[43:15.94]That's actually fair.
[43:17.48]That's fair.
[43:18.44]Because Poke is not scheduled to do his tour until a little bit later.
[43:21.36]So that's fair for me.
[43:22.46]That's fair.
[43:27.94]So let's just go... Browser...
[43:33.89]Uh, I'm just gonna just teleport around just to get it back to daytime.
[43:39.90]Jerma explaining things is so funny to me.
[43:41.84]Can you please help?
[43:42.56]Pokey's freaking out.
[43:47.94]Pokey need help?
[43:49.20]I can answer questions.
[43:50.65]I can answer technical questions.
[44:06.45]Tech support, yeah.
[44:12.80]He's panicking.
[44:22.32]There we go.
[44:24.00]So, it seems like most people have started outside.
[44:30.81]Which is fair, but how many of them actually put grass down?
[44:35.92]And what is their philosophy?
[44:37.36]And what the fuck is philosophy?
[44:39.28]I don't know.
[44:39.74]I just put it there because I wanted to have four grades.
[44:44.25]So mods, I do want to bring this up because... So when we do chat's grade, we're just going to do it in just solid letters.
[44:53.74]So it's only going to be A, B, C, or D.
[44:58.09]Because that'll be, technically, that'd be 95, 85, 75, 65 points.
[45:03.71]So, we can't do, like, a whole scale, I don't think.
[45:05.75]I mean, maybe we could.
[45:06.83]How many things do we have on the poll?
[45:09.81]We could do A+, A-, A-, I don't want to do that many, though.
[45:15.37]Because it's based on points.
[45:19.23]So, I think 95 could be fine, if you wanted to do an A. Poke is trying to sell the walls right now.
[45:36.82]Hey, give him a break.
[45:37.66]He was at the aquarium, okay?
[45:39.33]He was at the aquarium.
[45:57.73]So, how Poke could really spin this?
[46:01.70]I don't want to give anybody any help.
[46:03.30]No help, no help.
[46:04.40]But there is an animal DLC and if he figures out how to use it, he can go back and maybe see how to do that.
[46:10.52]He could make an aquarium.
[46:15.81]And just show us all the fishes that he saw.
[46:19.79]I don't want to give anybody any tips though.
[46:25.34]Yeah, we'll just do A, B, C, D. And the point system will just be 95, 85, 75, 65.
[46:33.92]For your grade.
[46:37.72]I have a whole spreadsheet here to calculate everything, so don't worry.
[46:42.32]Vinny's doing his best.
[46:45.28]Ludwig is doing something horrendous.
[46:53.96]I can't, I cannot wait.
[46:57.61]We're getting down there.
[46:59.65]Let me just at least paint one of the walls.
[47:01.09]Because people are going to be like, well, what about your house?
[47:03.19]What about your house?
[47:04.07]And I'm going to be like, well, it's not my... So let me get it to look at least okay.
[47:24.54]The grading scale has changed, do you mean?
[47:28.39]Poke is asking if other people scrimmed before this.
[47:31.40]I don't think so.
[47:33.42]A is now 90 to 100, not 95.
[47:34.24]I'm going on boomer grades.
[47:34.90]Sorry.
[47:46.44]An A, when I was in school, an A minus was 90, 91, 92.
[47:50.32]An A was 93, 94, 95, 96, and I believe also 97.
[47:52.00]An A plus I think was 98, 99, 100.
[47:52.94]Yeah, A plus is 100.
[47:54.72]A plus was 100, 99, and 98.
[47:55.24]I believe 93 to 97 was just A.
[48:14.59]We're not Americans.
[48:16.53]I am.
[48:17.55]And this is my American school.
[48:18.89]This is my American House Flipper school.
[48:21.97]We're going by American grades.
[48:24.55]Sorry.
[48:24.83]97 is an A+.
[48:28.80]I think that's true.
[48:37.48]He's American?
[48:42.00]What do you mean?
[48:42.67]Yeah.
[48:43.75]Yeah.
[48:47.27]Alright, anyways.
[48:56.52]What about an S-plus rank?
[48:58.94]I like S. I think S is a great addition to have.
[49:02.58]But there's no S in high school or college grades. ...
[49:18.42]Are you saying Poke's viewers are messing with him?
[49:20.81]Poke's viewers are messing with how many minutes he has and he is mega panicking.
[49:28.81]Oh, poor Poke.
[49:31.45]He probably was like walking around like, wow, oh, look at that like shark.
[49:36.68]Whoa, look at that fish.
[49:38.14]And he didn't even know that that 75 minutes had started.
[49:40.82]You know what I mean?
[49:43.06]He's probably sitting there like, oh, whoa, this is so cool.
[49:45.54]He probably went to lunch, probably had a wonderful lunch.
[49:49.11]And just had no idea that he was being timed at the aquarium.
[49:59.48]You've ruined his field trip.
[50:07.32]You called all these people into work?
[50:14.84]People are telling me he has four minutes.
[50:16.66]Alright, well, communicate with Poke that he has 37 minutes left.
[50:21.69]And longer.
[50:22.71]He actually has 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52.
[50:27.83]Poke has like another hour to make his house.
[50:33.24]Poke has another hour.
[50:41.00]Dude, he is soaking right now.
[50:42.98]What do you... What?
[50:43.56]Do you mean he went swimming at the aquarium?
[50:46.68]What are you talking about?
[50:50.24]You can't... Does this place have a pool?
[50:55.49]What are you... Poke gets an extra 30 minutes.
[51:07.06]Well, I think it's fair to give Poke at least 15 to 20 extra minutes.
[51:26.67]Hoax title is in all caps.
[51:29.58]You know what's going to be really fun?
[51:31.28]One of the reasons I did this whole event is obviously I'm just kind of walking around and just, you know, I'm just talking to you guys.
[51:37.27]Like, I'm the judge, right?
[51:38.73]I'm just waiting.
[51:41.10]But there's a lot of content.
[51:43.55]I just want to go watch everybody's stream.
[51:47.05]That's what I'm going to do tonight.
[51:48.53]I think like lying down in like bed or just like on the couch or something.
[51:52.99]I'm just going to go through and just pick out everybody's and just kind of just sit there and watch how they did it.
[52:00.83]That sounds fun.
[52:01.33]Alright, let's put some grass down.
[52:09.41]It is turf, I believe.
[52:11.01]Yes.
[52:20.23]Oh, wrong way.
[52:21.51]It's alright, I can do both ways.
[52:24.49]There we go.
[52:30.62]Vinny has one room.
[52:34.28]Vinny does not know how to spell refrigerator.
[52:43.82]Do we need to give everybody an extra 20 minutes?
[52:47.78]Do we have to give everybody an extra 10 to 20 minutes?
[52:53.40]If people are down, I am willing to extend by another 20 minutes.
[52:59.92]But it depends.
[53:00.62]People might have something to do today.
[53:08.74]They need it.
[53:09.22]They need it.
[53:09.62]They need it.
[53:10.27]No, no.
[53:10.71]It's way funnier if you don't.
[53:14.81]An hour goes by pretty quickly, as you see, especially when you know it's counting down.
[53:18.53]Alright, here's what we're going to do.
[53:21.76]We're going to stick to the plan.
[53:24.14]When it's pencils down, what we're going to do is we're going to get everybody in a call, and I'm going to propose.
[53:29.30]How does everybody feel?
[53:30.92]Does everybody feel like if we could all get a majority for an extra 20 minutes?
[53:36.75]We'll see.
[53:39.03]We'll see.
[53:43.19]If not, then we might just go for it.
[53:45.44]We might get three or four people that are like, look, man, I've got shit to do today.
[53:49.94]And that's alright.
[53:53.90]It's got to be unanimous.
[54:03.11]Vinny doesn't know how to spell refrigerator.
[54:17.21]You spell it.
[54:18.45]Okay.
[54:33.58]How do you spell it?
[54:35.36]How do you spell refrigerator?
[54:37.02]Is there a quicker way to paint?
[54:40.92]Yep.
[54:41.20]Okay, so when you... Are you inside or outside?
[54:44.84]I'm inside.
[54:45.36]Okay, so you're inside.
[54:47.11]You have the painting tool, right?
[54:49.87]You can paint because you did the cheats to make sure that you did all the perks, right?
[54:55.08]Yeah, I got them all.
[54:55.74]Okay.
[54:56.16]So you can paint three or four walls at the same time, but there is no faster way to go with paint unless you go outside with the paint spray.
[55:03.93]Oh, fuck.
[55:04.41]That sucks.
[55:04.93]Okay.
[55:05.35]That's fine.
[55:05.85]So you need to... You can do up to four walls at a time, painting.
[55:10.13]But yeah, you do have to paint the walls individually.
[55:12.25]You do.
[55:13.57]Oh, that sucks.
[55:14.31]Okay, that's fine.
[55:15.29]By the way, there is 32 minutes remaining as of right now.
[55:19.04]I think it'll be fine.
[55:20.12]I think it'll be fine.
[55:20.76]Thank you so much.
[55:22.08]Just want to make sure you are aware.
[55:27.82]Yeah, so the question that Connor had is a very good one.
[55:33.12]It is.
[55:44.72]OK, so, for instance, like.
[55:49.58]Connor is asking is, can you go faster than this?
[55:51.61]And it's going to be slow for me because I don't have all the upgrades.
[55:55.17]But if you have all the upgrades, you can do a few panels at a time.
[55:59.05]You can do, I think, up to four or five.
[56:01.29]So, but that's part of it.
[56:02.37]That's part of your process.
[56:07.32]Is what's important.
[56:10.24]I mean, it's with all the upgrades.
[56:14.04]Should be able to get at least most of a wall.
[56:17.83]Alright.
[56:18.03]Refrigerator, right?
[56:18.99]How do I do that?
[56:21.17]Okay.
[56:21.45]Refrigerator.
[56:21.99]How do you spell it?
[56:23.81]Re...
[56:28.00]There's no D. It's just refrigerator.
[56:31.56]Really?
[56:34.96]But that's how you spell fridge.
[56:39.35]That's how you spell fridge.
[56:42.63]So why is it re... Why is it not refrigerator?
[56:46.11]Why is it refrigerator?
[56:47.49]That's weird.
[56:52.42]Fridge is with a D.
[56:55.78]Can you do turf in the house?
[57:00.70]No, you can't.
[57:01.58]You can't do turf in the house.
[57:02.58]Sorry, everybody.
[57:05.92]What colors do I want to do?
[57:08.05]I should just do like a congratulations.
[57:09.69]You did it.
[57:10.05]I'm going to put like just like party stuff here.
[57:21.09]Like party.
[57:21.79]Like decorations.
[57:23.64]Decorations.
[57:28.55]Christmas.
[57:29.19]Here we go.
[57:31.67]Welcome.
[57:32.15]Yeah, here we go.
[57:35.33]We'll put, like, this everywhere.
[57:45.47]Oh, we'll do that.
[57:46.15]We'll do... Um, we'll put, like, Christmas stuff, maybe.
[57:53.34]Here we go.
[57:59.86]I guess.
[58:09.55]Your eyes are sucking my soul out.
[58:12.89]Hey, you need to relax.
[58:15.07]Alright.
[58:16.71]By the way, I feel like people didn't look into this, but there's a grappling hook to get up here.
[58:22.30]It's alright.
[58:23.10]I know they're under a little bit of stress.
[58:29.06]This is a chainsaw.
[58:31.18]You can get trees down faster.
[58:37.88]Build a wipeout course?
[58:52.08]Ludwig found the flamethrower.
[58:54.10]It's possible he just ruins this whole thing then.
[58:56.69]Don't tell him.
[58:58.19]Ludwig might accidentally click the button and burn the whole house down.
[59:00.67]And then, sorry.
[59:10.74]He already did that?!
[59:12.88]Oh no.
[59:24.10]Ludwig cannot find a certain paint right now.
[59:29.04]There were some interesting questions because... So... The question was asked.
[59:35.60]Hey, this is two stories, man.
[59:37.16]That's a lot.
[59:38.17]And I was like, yeah, it is.
[59:40.39]Oh, alright.
[59:40.97]And they were like... Oh, okay.
[59:45.91]But here's the thing.
[59:46.45]Take a look.
[59:48.51]You want to build the houses?
[59:50.65]You can make this a whole thing.
[59:53.69]I wonder who's the most focused.
[59:59.41]I think they were anticipating it was going to be one floor.
[60:02.91]If you want to do one really great floor, that's fine.
[60:06.43]Your complexity and your structure will be suffering, but your creativity score might be through the roof.
[60:19.21]I looked at Lud's stream and I regret it.
[60:30.58]Really important question.
[60:32.76]Has anybody cleaned their whole yard?
[60:39.40]Has anybody cleaned their yard?
[60:43.78]Most people did.
[60:44.70]Poke is kind of cooking low-key.
[60:48.34]Alright.
[60:48.92]Alright.
[60:49.98]Let's let it out.
[60:51.74]Let's let him cook.
[60:58.09]DogDog did that first.
[61:00.21]Mm-hmm.
[61:01.59]Smart.
[61:07.84]Ludwig is eating a brick on stream right now.
[61:10.96]That sounds like that sounds pretty fucked up.
[61:19.71]I'm going to make my bathroom.
[61:31.71]I've never seen Ludwig this focused.
[61:37.25]How much extra time should Poke get?
[61:39.09]Poke should get at least... When did he come into the call?
[61:45.58]When did Poke come into the call?
[61:46.56]What was the timer when Poke came into the call?
[61:50.66]It was 50 minutes.
[61:52.82]So 50, one hour... Uh, so Poke should get... Poke should get 20 minutes.
[61:59.33]Extra.
[62:03.46]Give Poke an extra 20.
[62:13.77]Because that would be the same time.
[62:15.65]I think that's fair.
[62:16.19]25 would be the same.
[62:30.24]We have to deduce five minutes.
[62:32.22]We have to deduce at least five minutes.
[62:33.65]Gotta give a five minute penalty.
[62:44.31]I wonder if anyone's gonna do anything outside.
[62:46.09]I feel like everyone's just like, okay, I gotta build walls.
[62:48.59]I gotta do this.
[62:49.27]What am I doing in this house?
[62:50.01]Okay, I wanna build this.
[62:50.65]I wanna do that.
[62:52.15]But does anybody make a nice fish pond out here?
[62:59.18]I don't know.
[63:00.26]Alright, let me do my bathroom.
[63:11.42]You mean deduct.
[63:12.10]I don't want to re-chat anymore.
[63:17.13]Because that's funny what you just said.
[63:19.29]So, I have to say it.
[63:20.17]Because I can't be... I have to be unbiased.
[63:23.81]Somebody said, Poke is painting his whole house right now with a paint color called Intense Rust.
[63:30.19]And I kind of have to delete that from my brain.
[63:33.07]I have to pretend like I did not hear that.
[63:37.43]I have to just know.
[63:38.60]I can't know that.
[63:39.72]Alright, let me get a door.
[63:46.38]That's a good bathroom door.
[63:56.75]I guess I could have typed it.
[64:01.76]This is funny.
[64:17.67]I'm having so much fun right now because I'm just imagining everybody else's streams.
[64:21.97]Is that weird?
[64:23.93]I'm sitting here just kind of hanging out.
[64:25.65]I'm watching imaginary streams right now.
[64:30.58]I don't know how many of you guys here are doing the same thing, or if you're jumping around to see what people are doing.
[64:34.54]But I'm watching imaginary streams.
[64:41.42]Do people even know how to do what I just did?
[64:44.67]Like, put the door in the wall?
[64:46.69]Like, in the inlet of the wall?
[64:49.11]I'm not even sure anybody knows how to do that.
[65:03.29]Connor is watching a tutorial.
[65:07.93]That makes me... That's so funny to me.
[65:10.13]I can't wait to watch everybody's perspectives later.
[65:11.93]20 minute warning.
[65:26.92]The mods are paying everybody in the channel.
[65:43.80]could do Sims build Invitational.
[65:45.60]I think the reason why this was doing it for me, the reason I thought this was funnier instead of The Sims is because first of all, it's 3D.
[65:54.83]It's a first person 3D game.
[65:57.05]And this game is very kind of oddly complicated.
[66:02.42]So you really do kind of need to know a lot of stuff about this game.
[66:07.13]I did try to give a detailed couple of pages of information to people.
[66:11.47]But even still, I feel like there's some things like, how do you put panels on walls?
[66:15.33]I don't fucking know.
[66:16.11]I have no idea.
[66:17.44]Yeah, the one minute warning.
[66:26.30]Yeah, once we get to 10 minutes, the Gordon Ramsay music is coming.
[66:34.96]Alright, this is supposed to be a bathroom.
[66:44.18]We need bathroom.
[66:52.21]Oh, I need a fixture.
[66:53.07]They don't even know that either, do they?
[66:55.19]Yeah, you need an actual fixture on the wall.
[66:58.95]You need the thing that the toilet can actually sit in.
[67:02.19]You need plumbing.
[67:03.21]Do they know that?
[67:10.48]Yeah, you need, you like need this in the ground.
[67:13.36]Does anybody know this?
[67:22.47]There's no way they know.
[67:26.27]No, they definitely, okay, part of the tutorial I gave them was to do the first couple missions to understand this, like what this means.
[67:45.53]We might need like a 15 minute extension.
[67:50.79]Well, I guess if you do type in toilet, you'll see this and be like, wait, do I need that?
[67:56.86]And everybody's chats, I'm assuming, are yelling at them how to do this.
[68:10.06]And they have to assemble it too.
[68:12.14]I can't wait to see half of the shit that's just not even assembled.
[68:15.87]Complexity and structure.
[68:17.83]Oh, that's minus my own points for complexity and structure.
[68:24.57]Ludwig is doing the Kubrick stare right now.
[68:28.78]Can I ask... How is Etalyx doing?
[68:33.02]How is Etalyx doing?
[68:34.22]Is Etalyx doing okay?
[68:39.98]He's doing great.
[68:43.48]How is... How's DugDug doing?
[68:48.45]Connor Eats Pants came in here and asked a very specific question about putting bars on the windows.
[68:52.99]So I don't even want to know what he's doing.
[68:59.64]Joel is losing his mind.
[69:00.92]Vinny, it feels like everybody's going insane.
[69:09.13]Do the houses have to be livable?
[69:11.01]No, no, that was not part of the criteria.
[69:13.77]It was just make the best house, the most interesting, the most just build, build a house that you want to build.
[69:23.03]Does anybody have an exterior wall yet?
[69:25.11]Does anybody, are they all like this?
[69:26.55]I'm going to laugh.
[69:27.05]So don't tell me.
[69:27.75]I don't want to know.
[69:28.69]Actually, don't tell me if every single person has a fucking exterior that looks like this.
[69:32.03]I'm going to laugh my ass off.
[69:33.35]Don't tell me.
[69:34.31]I actually, I'm going to wait till chat like settles down because I don't even want to look over here.
[69:40.10]Because that is so goddamn funny if everybody has the exact same exterior.
[69:44.66]The same exterior concrete paint.
[69:51.38]I can't look over at chat until it's safe.
[70:03.74]Do you know who's going to get a lot of points?
[70:06.02]Whoever has exterior paint on their house.
[70:14.84]Can we get a quick recap of the rules?
[70:16.62]Absolutely.
[70:18.48]There are 10.
[70:20.22]There are 10 people here.
[70:21.78]There are 10 streamers.
[70:23.48]Each one started at the same time with this house.
[70:25.98]They all started.
[70:26.66]This was all messed up.
[70:28.22]The windows were all boarded up.
[70:30.17]The lawn was all dirty.
[70:31.33]There was trash everywhere.
[70:32.75]Everybody started at the same time.
[70:34.35]They all had 75 minutes at the same time.
[70:36.45]One, two, three, go.
[70:37.43]They're all streaming their perspectives.
[70:39.57]They have to build the best house they can in that time limit.
[70:44.88]Well, except Poke.
[70:46.16]Yeah, except for Poke.
[70:46.78]Poke was here later, but we're good.
[70:49.86]Everybody's here now.
[70:51.06]So, we're good.
[70:52.92]Everybody's building.
[70:54.02]Everybody is currently intensely focused.
[70:55.96]There's 16 minutes left.
[70:57.81]We might come to a unanimous decision when everybody is like, I need more time, I need more time.
[71:03.65]If it's possible, we might get a unanimous decision to add an extra 15 to 20 minutes.
[71:09.41]We might do that.
[71:10.31]It's possible.
[71:13.06]At the end of this, each person is going to individually give me
[71:17.28]a one-on-one tour of their house.
[71:19.54]So, we have Discord here.
[71:21.30]We are... Discord... I'm going to... They're going to share their Discord screen with the game, and they're going to walk me through it one-on-one.
[71:29.38]I'm going to, at the end of that, about five to seven minute tour, I'm going to be grading them based on a few categories.
[71:36.15]They're going to be graded on... And these are 100 through 60, the point system.
[71:40.53]Nobody gets an F, because we figured that's kind of mean, considering if somebody...
[71:45.15]you know what I mean that's I don't want to be mean to anybody so we got 100 point scale 100 to 60. if it 60 is the lowest you can get d minus so creativity is one of the categories complexity and structure is a category cleanliness is a category philosophy what was your philosophy with this whole thing that's a category
[72:09.61]And then at the very end, you guys are going to get a grade too.
[72:13.51]Your grade is worth 10% of the overall grade.
[72:15.99]Creativity is worth 35%.
[72:16.85]Complexity is worth 25%.
[72:17.37]Cleanliness, 15%.
[72:18.17]Philosophy, 15%.
[72:18.79]Adding up to 100.
[72:19.21]There you go.
[72:33.94]Philosophy is the vibes, bro.
[72:35.68]That's exactly, you got it exactly.
[72:38.02]If you've got a fucked up house and you didn't do the walls right, but man, the vibes are immaculate in here.
[72:45.06]The philosophy was immaculate.
[72:46.74]That's an A. If nobody gets an F, doesn't that make D the new F?
[73:00.04]Probably.
[73:04.77]That's only 95%.
[73:05.11]35% plus 25% is 35, 45, 55, 60 plus 15 plus 15, which is 60, 70, 80, 90 plus 10%, which is your grade is 100.
[73:08.62]Trust me, I spent a lot of time on this.
[73:23.88]this grading system was I sat there for at least 15 minutes no he's actually at least I actually spent time on this I wanted to make sure this went off like okay so there was some time putting this have enough but just don't give it to anybody stop wasting time I I'm not being graded
[73:52.24]I am here merely as technical support and as a judge and to help you along the way understand what I'm doing this for.
[74:01.51]And the answer to that question is for absolutely no reason.
[74:05.09]Nobody wins anything.
[74:07.47]The grades don't give you anything.
[74:09.93]There's no winner.
[74:12.13]It's just get some people together and make some fun shit.
[74:17.19]That's it.
[74:20.31]You should just leave the call and play something else.
[74:22.69]Just don't even grade anybody.
[74:23.83]Just be like, alright, later.
[74:25.11]Turn my stream off and just like delete the tweet.
[74:35.72]Every streamer right now is puking blood with stress.
[74:48.04]Intense rust.
[74:55.06]I hope all the cheats were enabled for everybody.
[74:58.79]Because it actually would be very hard.
[75:00.69]The reason why the timer is okay where it is, is because everybody should have all the tools unlocked and fully upgraded.
[75:07.47]Because you are watching, I do not have the tools upgraded.
[75:19.47]Will there be a winner's build-off after?
[75:21.29]I didn't really think that far, if I'll be really honest with you.
[75:26.07]Just trying to get more than 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 people streaming at the same time was probably the hardest part.
[75:33.57]If you guys like this, if after this is over and we do all the tours and everyone has a great time, then why the fuck I would do it again 100%?
[75:40.91]Get different streamers, different people.
[75:42.57]This is just like people that I know.
[75:45.69]I obviously would love to open it up to more streamers and more content creators and stuff.
[75:49.50]That would be a lot of fun.
[75:54.22]There were a couple of people that I reached out to that couldn't do it that I would love to see what they would do.
[75:59.94]So there are a couple, there are two or three people that are not here today.
[76:05.98]So I would love to see what they do.
[76:11.76]Expand the torture.
[76:27.59]And also, too, like, I want to, like, obviously include as many people as I can.
[76:31.35]But I think I told you this yesterday, the day before.
[76:36.37]I'm actually pretty... I'm not that well connected on Twitch, on YouTube, as much as maybe some of you might think I am.
[76:43.58]But I would love to open this up to just have more people.
[76:46.82]For sure.
[76:52.60]Can I just do the whole house this yellow?
[76:58.21]It's getting down to 10 minutes remaining here.
[77:08.37]It might be time to change the music.
[77:12.62]Alright, let's change the music.
[77:13.78]What would be Hell's Kitchen?
[77:22.14]Like, music?
[77:22.80]Music?
[77:37.83]10 streamers had exactly 75 minutes to build a house in House Flipper.
[77:42.09]Unfortunately, only one of them will get the golden jacket.
[77:46.15]We've seen some drama tonight too, as Poke showed up 25 minutes late.
[77:50.91]This is where the part where Poke is in the chair and he's like, I didn't, I was at the aquarium and I don't know what the fuck is going on.
[77:57.22]I got a beep on my phone.
[77:59.06]I had to get there and I got there fast.
[78:02.40]But what we don't understand here is what was happening over on Etalyx' stream.
[78:07.03]And like it shows him just like fucking smashing his fucking desk.
[78:12.98]I'm not doing this anymore.
[78:15.10]I'm not doing this anymore, Jerma.
[78:24.31]Who's getting eliminated?
[78:31.77]Nine minutes.
[78:40.47]Where's the sounds?
[78:43.70]Oh, that's true.
[78:44.38]They should be here now.
[78:48.00]Yeah, where are they?
[78:53.30]Eight minutes before we get everybody in here to ask the very important question of how are we going to handle this?
[79:02.29]You should add sound effects.
[79:07.36]I like... Alright.
[79:13.31]I'm going to get up like the violin sound.
[79:16.23]Okay.
[79:17.04]I know what I'm doing for the next 10 minutes.
[79:18.42]Give me a second.
[79:46.28]Okay, I got that one.
[79:50.88]I got the theme song.
[80:06.16]Am I going to do this forever?
[80:08.21]There's 10 tours I have to do.
[80:11.27]I can't do it for every... Okay, I'll do it for every single one.
[80:14.53]I'll do it for every single one.
[80:16.44]At least the first, like, three.
[80:20.64]We got seven minutes.
[80:23.94]Poke is the only one with a little extra time, but that's alright.
[80:27.36]We do have a schedule of who's going when.
[80:30.95]We're gonna have to move the schedule a little, because Poke was scheduled for 3.20.
[80:37.27]But I think we're gonna have to move Poke, because Poke's still gonna be... Actually, it might still make it.
[80:43.20]I think he might still be fine.
[80:49.27]Okay, any other Hell's Kitchen sound effect?
[80:55.63]How many sound effects are there?
[80:57.71]Violin?
[80:58.25]Isn't this the same thing?
[80:59.45]It's the same sound, right?
[81:09.89]Yeah, it's the same sound.
[81:10.73]There's only one sound effect.
[81:19.59]Just put Gordon Ramsay yelling at somebody in the background, too.
[81:22.33]No, that's too much.
[81:25.73]Need a boom?
[81:26.35]I need, like, a boom effect?
[81:43.79]Oh, it's this one.
[81:47.17]How loud is this?
[81:49.51]This is so fucking loud.
[81:50.61]I have to turn this way down.
[81:57.82]This is at like 0.0%.
[82:06.34]Five minutes.
[82:07.64]Almost at the five minute timer.
[82:10.91]Five minutes.
[82:13.41]Five minutes.
[82:17.86]Alright, how loud is this?
[82:19.02]Let's see.
[82:22.84]Careful, this might be loud.
[82:23.83]I'm just trying to get it to where I can... That's really... That's not... This one... Alright, that's good.
[82:30.19]Right there's good.
[82:30.63]Alright, let's get them all together.
[82:34.81]So, show me what you got here, Etalyx.
[82:44.00]Well, see, I'm over here and this is my bathroom.
[82:48.91]Bathroom.
[82:50.19]Don't you think it's a little dirty, don't you think?
[82:51.85]Okay.
[83:00.00]They're not gonna be able to hear that.
[83:03.18]The boom is too quiet.
[83:11.81]We have less than five minutes are remaining.
[83:20.95]Alright, I got to get my, so there you go.
[83:23.21]I'm going to get everything ready.
[83:24.49]Let me make sure I have my camera set up, everything set up because I'm going to have to be doing through sharing screens and let me get that set because I want to be able to get right into it.
[83:31.92]So give me one second.
[83:33.96]I will be back.
[83:34.50]You're going to see the screen's going to go black and then I'll be back.
[84:19.81]I think I actually think I'm good.
[84:22.55]I think I'm ready.
[84:24.09]The question is, is everybody so okay, let me just warn everybody here.
[84:28.48]This is a really important warning.
[84:30.88]They're all going to get unmuted at the same time.
[84:33.56]And everyone's going to be probably complaining and like yelling at me and saying like, hey, do this if I needed more time, like, hey, dude, my house sucks or like, fuck you.
[84:40.68]There's gonna be a lot of fighting, I think.
[84:43.20]So just be ready for everyone to unmute at the same time.
[84:47.10]It's going to be hell on Earth here.
[84:50.76]Alright.
[84:52.08]Who do you think makes the first complaint?
[84:55.67]Who complains first?
[84:57.43]I think that's a good idea to figure that out.
[85:01.75]Who is immediately the first person that we hear being very mad at me or very upset?
[85:17.85]Give minus 10 points to the person that complains first.
[85:23.65]We have to be very, very attentive to this.
[85:27.02]Minus five points to the person that complains first.
[85:30.88]And not just like, oh, wow, that was so hard.
[85:32.72]I mean like an audible, like, like this was annoying.
[85:35.70]You know what I mean?
[85:36.24]Like an audible, like complaint.
[85:49.89]There has to be some Karen shit.
[85:51.57]Yeah, oh yeah.
[85:53.90]Don't- and don't give it away either.
[85:55.24]I was gonna put it as part of their grade.
[86:00.02]Minus five points from philosophy because of that.
[86:02.62]That's right.
[86:04.06]See, you get it.
[86:05.05]You get it.
[86:05.77]You understand now.
[86:12.69]One minute is on the clock.
[86:21.14]No, I'm going to wait to play this because I want this to play while everyone's freaking out and yelling at me.
[86:34.68]Final 60 seconds.
[86:36.14]Here it comes.
[86:38.65]Count it down.
[86:51.96]What did you say?
[86:53.68]Get the clock ticking sound from 24.
[86:55.46]Alright, here we go.
[87:00.70]We gotta tell everybody, pencils down.
[87:02.36]And if you're in their chats, tell them too.
[87:04.70]When I start saying this, tell them too.
[87:07.17]We're going on the honor system here, besides Poke.
[87:10.67]Poke is the only one that gets a little extra time.
[87:13.21]So do not do this to Poke.
[87:14.35]But everybody else is on the honor system.
[87:18.67]We got 15 seconds.
[87:19.79]Here we go.
[87:23.03]Who?
[87:24.55]Whose cuisine reigns supreme?
[87:28.00]We will find out very shortly.
[87:36.43]God, that hurts my head.
[87:38.11]I didn't know it did that.
[87:41.63]Stop.
[87:42.37]What's going on?
[87:42.87]Who's doing that?
[87:45.87]I'm being electrocuted.
[87:48.22]Alright.
[87:49.64]Is the pencils down?
[87:50.34]Pencils down!
[87:50.92]Pencils down!
[87:51.60]Oh, we're doing that in the Discord to tell everybody.
[87:53.36]Alright.
[87:53.84]Pencils are down!
[87:54.64]Pencils are down!
[87:55.34]Pencils are down!
[87:55.98]Pencils are down!
[87:58.32]I've never been more stressed in my entire life.
[88:00.30]Me too, man.
[88:01.30]I'm gonna cry.
[88:05.08]This is fucked, Jerma.
[88:06.54]I gotta say, I, uh... I didn't realize how quick 75 minutes was.
[88:12.93]is pretty quick it sounded so long during the prep I was like that's that's like 10 minutes per room that's easy 30 minutes per room from learning the game while doing it hold on hold on hold on yeah we we we can so poke is still going poke has been given special uh time because poke showed up 30 minutes late um so poke is still building right now he's got about 20 minutes left let me let me let's let's ask the group
[88:37.80]How are you all doing?
[88:38.70]Do you guys want an extra 10 to 15 minutes?
[88:43.26]I feel good.
[88:44.28]I'll take an extra five.
[88:45.98]Well, Poke, you have like an extra almost 25 minutes.
[88:50.54]Yeah, you're good.
[88:51.90]I think we're good.
[88:53.76]Just to put those final touches on, just to make sure it's just right.
[88:56.82]I would actually like no extra time because I think everybody else has...
[89:03.81]messed up and I don't think five minutes will help me.
[89:06.21]I need like 45.
[89:09.84]So I selfishly, I selfishly think that the people, yeah, some people could use five to 10.
[89:15.74]I couldn't, I need three hours.
[89:17.42]I'm gonna be held back by the baddies.
[89:20.69]Is it okay if I like went over by two minutes?
[89:24.05]No.
[89:24.55]Definitely not.
[89:26.05]That's minus 10.
[89:26.81]No, that's not allowed.
[89:28.25]Poke.
[89:28.61]Poke.
[89:28.81]What if I put... Jeremiah, what if I put your dog in it?
[89:31.67]Will that give me two points back?
[89:33.81]I just want time to finish the shrine, you know?
[89:37.53]Oh, yeah.
[89:37.81]Well, you know, 75 minutes is 75 minutes.
[89:41.11]We had the confines of the time.
[89:42.21]We should play within the time allocated to us.
[89:44.77]You have to remain within the confines of the tortilla.
[89:46.89]That's correct.
[89:47.31]The only thing is... Poke.
[89:48.53]Poke.
[89:49.45]Poke.
[89:49.67]You should get out of here because you have like an extra 20 minutes to build.
[89:52.70]I mean, I'm down to take the L. You just want to take the L?
[89:58.39]I mean, I'm not going to lose, but I mean, I can take the L. You're certainly going to lose.
[90:03.37]You don't see, man.
[90:04.59]I got some crazy designs.
[90:06.69]Alright.
[90:07.37]Alright.
[90:07.91]Alright.
[90:09.53]Were you guys as stressed as I was?
[90:11.37]Did you ask?
[90:11.77]I was miserable.
[90:13.72]Miserable.
[90:15.40]Goddamn.
[90:16.72]It's not easy.
[90:17.48]So I'm really happy that everybody had a really good time.
[90:20.16]I'm really glad to hear that.
[90:21.52]That's not what we said.
[90:22.52]Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[90:24.45]Everybody thought it was fun.
[90:26.63]Alright so here we go. So how's it gonna start? We're gonna go just- you all should have the times. You- feel free to stick around if you want to watch. Everyone should be uh- we did some Discord uh- testing.
[90:35.63]I am curious, I want to watch.
[90:38.00]So feel free to watch, but the only thing is it will only be me and the other person in a one-on-one in this call, but feel free to react to it and watch what other people did.
[90:46.00]So, the first one - Joel it is you. So, Joel if you would- if you could turn on your uh- your screen on Discord.
[90:57.02]Let me see this.
[90:58.00]Also, if someone needs to go earlier, I'm feeling a little bit better than this morning so I can swap if someone needs to get out of here faster.
[91:07.72]Oh, we can figure that out in due time for sure.
[91:10.08]If anybody wants to swap with Etalyx where he is currently.
[91:14.15]I'm chilling.
[91:15.01]Okay.
[91:15.53]Yeah.
[91:16.26]Alright.
[91:16.52]So let me get out of this because I need to be able to capture this.
[91:19.46]So let's get this started.
[91:20.86]So we have about five to seven minutes.
[91:22.58]The times aren't going to be exact.
[91:23.88]I just don't want to... I gave us a time constraint because I don't want the people at the end of this to be waiting around for like two hours.
[91:28.68]So let's get started.
[91:29.86]Joel, you ready?
[91:30.85]I am going to open yours up.
[91:32.57]I have your audio through here too, just to let you know.
[91:34.77]So if you're going to play any loud sound effects.
[91:37.49]Let me do this first.
[91:38.23]Also probably a good idea to quick save for everyone.
[91:40.81]It is.
[91:41.57]How do you do that?
[91:42.69]Yeah.
[91:43.09]How do you quick save?
[91:44.19]Alt F4.
[91:45.99]oh no don't don't do that don't do that I win how do you actually quick save it or yeah really okay we are ready Joel hold on one more second let's make sure I can see everything that you're doing I'm gonna try to go to Jerma stream chat
[92:10.21]Okay, so this is Joel's view.
[92:13.21]Yes, sir.
[92:13.85]Let me make sure I can see your whole entire thing.
[92:18.55]Hold on.
[92:19.11]I got to get it in the frame.
[92:20.13]Okay, hold on.
[92:29.10]Let me just exit my game so I can hear this better.
[92:31.56]I can get rid of the timer as well.
[92:37.08]I can hear somebody swearing.
[92:39.81]No, don't worry about that.
[92:41.11]Don't worry about that.
[92:41.87]No.
[92:44.09]Okay.
[92:44.79]Move this.
[92:45.19]I'm going to get out of my game.
[92:48.88]Okay.
[92:50.42]Okay.
[92:51.66]You can begin.
[92:53.30]You can begin your tour.
[92:55.54]I am here and I'm ready.
[92:57.34]Okay, Jerma.
[92:57.98]So, the extensive cleanup that I did of this.
[93:01.87]First of all, before we go into the house, I want to make sure that you see all of my nice cleanup that I did.
[93:06.71]There's no trash.
[93:07.67]There's nothing going on here.
[93:09.15]And as you can see, it's all pretty damn good.
[93:11.81]You know, and don't worry about that, but whatever.
[93:14.38]So, my point is, I did a lot here to make sure this was going to be presentable and good.
[93:18.66]Now, first thing you're going to see is a crime scene yellow tape.
[93:22.84]That doesn't matter.
[93:23.46]Joel, before, could you just stand still for one second?
[93:25.42]Because the bitrate, your bitrate is phenomenal.
[93:29.55]Oh, really?
[93:30.13]Yeah, well, you're going to have to go to each room and freeze for like five seconds.
[93:33.71]Okay, okay, okay.
[93:35.19]You can lower the FPS too, that can help sometimes.
[93:38.68]If you're like running native, the bitrate kind of suffers.
[93:41.30]So a lower FPS streaming helps.
[93:47.18]What is that sound?
[93:49.61]You can always just watch my stream.
[93:50.97]I'm also streaming it on my channel if you want.
[93:52.47]I can pull that up too.
[93:54.15]But this is one-to-one.
[93:55.63]So I can actually react with you.
[93:57.43]I think it's actually good now.
[93:59.31]Did you make a change?
[94:01.07]No, it's all the same.
[94:02.19]Oh, okay.
[94:03.25]I think it looks alright.
[94:03.98]Okay.
[94:05.28]You ready?
[94:06.06]I'm ready.
[94:07.36]Okay, so you see the yellow tape that says crime scene do not cross?
[94:10.46]Don't worry about it.
[94:11.42]Okay.
[94:12.06]Now, what I did here is I made sure that even though my house is floss, I made sure to point them out to kind of get a bit of a, you know, like be aware there are some issues here since a trip hazard in here.
[94:22.03]Sure.
[94:22.35]Now, as you watch the bathroom here, I did an interior decorating here that shows that I got a sense of humor in the, you know, face of...
[94:30.90]terror so I didn't install a toilet but I installed a hole here instead okay or a bucket if you prefer I install a poop knife for the the willing and a plate of brownies now if you might notice there's a picture of William the foe looking at you yeah I was gonna ask about that courage there's only uh to encourage you know fecal content
[94:51.58]But as you can see, yes to that, no to that.
[94:54.45]You know, be careful, be aware.
[94:57.15]So that on the right, that's somebody defecating.
[95:00.47]Is that what that is?
[95:04.33]No, it's art.
[95:06.23]Anyway, that's a bathroom and it's a big window out here, but you own this entire area, so it should be fine.
[95:13.83]Anyway, that's a bathroom, you know, and in here, I made sure to do a little thematic thing here.
[95:20.65]As you can see, there's an alien in here.
[95:22.25]And you go in here and you notice, wow, there's a lot going on.
[95:25.19]There's a bit of a sci-fi theme.
[95:27.35]There's a UFO in the ceiling.
[95:28.73]Sci-fi theme.
[95:30.53]Yes.
[95:31.07]Everybody check this out.
[95:35.05]Oh, alright.
[95:36.12]I like it.
[95:36.76]I like the radio.
[95:38.50]Yeah.
[95:39.94]What is on the radio?
[95:40.58]I don't like aliens.
[95:41.64]I don't like aliens.
[95:43.80]So, you know, say no to alien abduction.
[95:46.44]There's a little cow being abducted.
[95:47.94]There's some corn for the alien.
[95:50.17]And as you can see here, this is the guy from Toy Story, Gary.
[95:53.82]Okay.
[95:54.90]You know, I got a little gleeby-deeby guy and a toilet, too.
[95:58.48]But this is going to be playing throughout your house tour and going to irritate you.
[96:03.50]So I'm basically telling you that if you're impervious to migraines, this is great.
[96:09.29]But if you're not, then, you know, whatever.
[96:11.49]But anyway, that's just the bottom floor here.
[96:13.61]Now, I want to guide you out of here because I have something very, very good for you.
[96:17.79]Now, there's two options here.
[96:19.73]You can check out the amazing maze or the hidden green gobbler room.
[96:25.83]Can we go to the PlayStation 1 Green Gobbler room?
[96:30.36]You got it.
[96:30.78]This is the Green Gobbler, and as you can see, picture Willem Dafoe.
[96:35.08]You go in here, and there's a little shrine dedicated to the man.
[96:39.25]So, as you all heard, Jermachet, Willem, William... Oh, fuck, I fucked up.
[96:46.19]It must be Willem.
[96:48.90]Is that Jack Nicholson up there?
[96:51.87]No, that's William Dafoe.
[96:53.31]Anyway, he died this year, and I want to make sure that everybody remembers.
[96:56.91]He died of gas.
[96:58.61]So over here, there's the poisonous gas storage where William Dafoe was turned into the Green Goblin.
[97:05.07]There's an air conditioning unit here that lets you smoke the gas to turn into Spider-Man.
[97:12.22]You and I are not so different, Spider-Man.
[97:16.16]I'm putting down a complexity grade here.
[97:20.28]What I enjoy... Let me stop you for one second.
[97:23.72]I do very much enjoy the green goblin room.
[97:27.68]I think it was a very good creative choice.
[97:30.22]What I'm very... I think I'm upset with here is the fact that that's Jack Nicholson's picture up there, not actually Willem Dafoe.
[97:36.35]And over on the right there, that's... Can you get in close to that, please?
[97:40.27]Yeah, that picture.
[97:40.91]This?
[97:41.29]Yeah.
[97:42.03]Just get in real close and just stand still for a second, because I want people to be able to see this as it buffers a little bit here.
[97:46.87]uh yeah that's I'm gonna give you a little bit points deducted from that because this is one of my least favorite images on the internet so I'm gonna deduct a few points for you from that one for your uh for your philosophy I do I do like the vision I'm a big fan of the vision
[98:06.13]Anyway, I'll take it.
[98:09.43]So you can see here, there's the gas from there.
[98:12.43]And once you've ingested the gas, the mask starts talking to you.
[98:17.44]And you can stand in front of the mirror and it goes, you know, Spider-Man.
[98:22.32]So you made an entire green goblin room.
[98:26.78]Yeah.
[98:27.63]Alright.
[98:29.69]I think it's how much more of your house is there?
[98:33.40]A little bit.
[98:34.56]There's just two areas left.
[98:35.66]I want to quickly show off.
[98:37.52]So, that's a green gobbler.
[98:39.34]I like it.
[98:39.66]I want to show this off.
[98:40.97]Put a little reference to... Please don't deduct points.
[98:47.79]Please don't deduct points.
[98:48.91]I don't know what it is.
[98:50.89]The pixels are trying so hard to put that image on the screen.
[98:55.57]It looks... Whoa!
[98:56.91]That just actually scared me.
[98:58.51]There's another person behind me.
[99:02.37]Can I interrupt real quick?
[99:03.47]If we made it daytime, it probably would have helped.
[99:07.65]That's true.
[99:08.17]How do I do that?
[99:09.40]If you exit and re-enter.
[99:11.16]Yeah, sleep in a bed.
[99:11.86]I don't have a bed.
[99:13.14]I think it's also because you are technically sharing from across the world.
[99:17.86]I think that's another reason.
[99:20.52]We can see it.
[99:23.40]maybe okay just checking can we just listen to the audio for a second I just can I get just into I this is going to be a part of your grade because philosophy I'm yeah I want to turn your volume up I want to hear that you gotta go to listening to that
[99:51.70]I think I got it.
[99:52.28]Yeah, I got it.
[99:53.35]Okay.
[99:53.99]Anyway, quick thing here.
[99:55.13]We had some problems.
[99:56.61]Somebody died, but it's okay because, you know, life and death is kind of synonymous with each other.
[100:02.39]And through death, life comes.
[100:04.39]So we're growing corn here from it.
[100:06.61]Oh, a garden!
[100:07.55]Actually, garden!
[100:08.32]You... Okay.
[100:10.06]Yes, and it's also solar powered, so it's, you know, it's environmentally healthy.
[100:15.46]Okay.
[100:15.82]But anyway, speaking of gardens, I made sure to include a little puzzle because we all like mind puzzles, right?
[100:20.66]Yeah.
[100:21.45]So here's the amazing thing.
[100:22.91]Alright, wait, wait.
[100:24.09]Can you actually sleep?
[100:25.05]Can you like reset your game?
[100:26.59]Like just go to a different house and come back to this one.
[100:27.99]Alright, so just go back to your office and then come back to this house.
[100:30.97]Make this your office.
[100:32.15]Make office here.
[100:33.49]No, yeah, make this your office.
[100:37.00]Yeah, move office here.
[100:38.52]Move office here.
[100:39.98]Okay.
[100:40.32]Put the computer down.
[100:41.82]Now go, just leave here and come back because I think we'll fix some of the vision problems that way.
[100:46.10]Main menu?
[100:48.30]Yeah, and just come right back in.
[100:50.40]Or just like, yeah, just go to the computer.
[100:52.48]Yeah, just reload it, reload it.
[100:54.26]And then continue game.
[100:55.14]Yeah, you should be good to go.
[100:56.78]Okay, okay.
[100:57.44]Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
[100:59.28]Don't worry, chat, I made sure to save.
[101:00.96]Also, you can, on Joel's stream too, has like the HQ high quality version, so.
[101:08.04]Yeah.
[101:09.06]I can still get, I can still see what you're doing.
[101:11.66]Okay, cool, cool, cool.
[101:13.48]Watch the game crash now.
[101:16.98]No, we're good.
[101:17.42]We're gravy.
[101:18.12]Alright, so back over here.
[101:20.10]Okay, as you can see, laptop, this damage you missed, kind of.
[101:26.64]I see the vision.
[101:27.53]I see the vision.
[101:28.81]Okay, cool.
[101:29.71]So we're going to move on here.
[101:31.75]And this is the amazing mace, by the way, right?
[101:35.19]It's all the grass.
[101:36.15]But, you know, I'm going to open your stream.
[101:39.01]Okay, yeah, yeah.
[101:40.03]And you're like...
[101:41.71]My God, I have solved the maze.
[101:44.31]And Jerma, Jerma, this is for you, buddy, because I know someone has a special day coming up.
[101:49.55]You've solved the maze.
[101:50.55]You've done the brain puzzle.
[101:51.69]And ladies and gentlemen, happy birthday, Jeremy.
[101:55.20]Happy 60th.
[101:57.14]We are so proud of you, buddy.
[101:58.60]Have a racing cake.
[102:02.16]Thank you.
[102:03.74]It is my birthday in months and months from now.
[102:07.14]I really appreciate it.
[102:09.53]That's right.
[102:10.98]Oh, and that's not how tall I am.
[102:12.68]But you're getting points removed for creativity for that one because the short joke is, I think, well... Happy 60th birthday, Jeremy.
[102:17.22]Well on its way out by now.
[102:18.60]Happy 60th.
[102:20.82]We are so proud of you.
[102:23.76]But anyway, yeah, this is a little mace that leads to your personal pleasure zone.
[102:28.61]Okay?
[102:29.75]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[102:30.55]Go back to the table for a second.
[102:32.55]Uh-huh.
[102:33.57]And what is this?
[102:34.49]This is a cake?
[102:36.50]This is a little racing cake, buddy.
[102:37.84]You like racing cakes.
[102:39.50]Okay.
[102:41.42]I actually... And a spider.
[102:43.56]I'm going to pull you back a few points on... I'm going to pull you back a few points on philosophy on this one because I actually don't really like raisins that much at all.
[102:52.81]So, that's a blunder.
[102:54.83]You like the spider, though, right?
[102:56.59]The spider is cool, but the raisins, I'm not a big fan of raisins.
[102:59.29]Well, thanks for reinstating all my points, buddy.
[103:01.21]You're my friend.
[103:04.38]I cannot wait to go back and watch you do this.
[103:08.20]Okay.
[103:09.34]So, we have a final area here.
[103:11.40]Wait, there's another area.
[103:12.16]Okay.
[103:12.38]Alright.
[103:12.78]Yeah, more, more, more.
[103:13.42]There's a final area here that I want to show off because Jerma, you like Twister?
[103:19.52]It's, you know, timeless game, right?
[103:21.38]Twister.
[103:21.86]Do you like wall Twister?
[103:23.44]Yeah, I guess it would be.
[103:25.22]You figure this shit out because I ran out of time.
[103:27.55]Anyway, as you can see, look at that.
[103:29.91]Okay.
[103:31.99]That's right.
[103:33.31]Please give me 10 points for being so caring.
[103:36.03]Anybody that has Otto in their house gets an extra two or three points, at least on every category.
[103:41.25]That's right.
[103:42.53]And I put some Bop-Its in because, you know, I'm sure you like Bop-Its.
[103:45.52]These are real Bop-Its, by the way.
[103:47.40]What is to the right?
[103:48.12]What is down there?
[103:48.58]Is that like an air conditioner?
[103:50.68]That's a printer.
[103:51.22]We all like to print shit.
[103:55.29]You know what's wicked funny?
[103:56.91]My printer's actually on the ground.
[103:58.47]Like that.
[103:59.47]You get points for creativity for that one.
[104:01.55]Alright.
[104:02.05]My printer's actually on the ground just like that.
[104:05.75]Okay.
[104:06.21]Now, check this out.
[104:07.07]There's a bunch of... Oh, oh my god.
[104:08.99]Okay, there we go.
[104:09.82]Bunch of spiders in the ceiling.
[104:11.12]But don't worry.
[104:12.24]The spider infestation problem is mostly resolved.
[104:14.96]Mmm, cleanliness.
[104:18.18]Well.
[104:19.00]Well, don't worry about that, Jerma, because we're about to go a little meta here.
[104:22.52]Okay?
[104:22.94]Ready?
[104:23.16]Mm-hmm.
[104:25.05]Ladies and gentlemen, beware of the Boggler.
[104:28.67]And there's a little star referenced here.
[104:31.32]Oh, he's not here.
[104:34.14]Doesn't matter because Jerma, it's your streamer room.
[104:37.68]Oh!
[104:39.49]got your Reddit shelf over here you know check that out you got your whole thing you're eating a chicken egg a tomato and you love uh that tomato sorry sorry dude tomatoes I'm sorry that's that's yes yeah but whatever that's that's fine but check this out uh it's nice milk and there's a big milk bucket and as you can see on the floor it's infested with rats friendly rats mind you
[105:02.25]Okay, they look, that looks cool.
[105:03.57]What's that poster?
[105:04.17]Can you get in close and just freeze frame it on there for a second?
[105:06.49]This is the, this is the flavors.
[105:08.03]What's your flavor?
[105:08.93]Now you're, you are a gamer, so you like Seeds of Victory.
[105:12.46]Uh-huh.
[105:13.28]Cashews of Chaos.
[105:14.62]Cashews, no.
[105:15.28]Nuts of Destruction.
[105:16.94]Definitely not cashews, for sure.
[105:18.06]Gamer Snacks.
[105:19.42]What's that one?
[105:19.82]Gamer Snacks?
[105:21.32]Gourmet Trail Mixer.
[105:23.08]I actually don't eat very many gamer snacks, but I do appreciate the fact that you're trying to make people- Like and subscribe!
[105:28.86]Uh, well you can't do that on Twitch and I pretty much only predominantly use Twitch and that's minus points for uh complexity because that- my spine looked a little weird there.
[105:38.86]Tried to get your room right and it's a 1-1 recreation.
[105:43.86]Now we are on to the last room here everybody.
[105:44.86]Alright, this is it.
[105:46.00]So uh I wanted to have a theme- various themes here and one of them was an OSHA violation.
[105:52.96]So as you can see, OSHA top 10 violations.
[105:56.12]We're going to be cooking guns and we're going to be using a sink here and enjoy this sink drink.
[106:05.78]Are those plenty of shock?
[106:07.18]What's on the ground?
[106:08.80]What's all over the ground?
[106:09.92]Are those propane tanks?
[106:11.50]Explosives?
[106:12.34]Yeah.
[106:12.96]That's what I thought.
[106:14.46]Well, as you can see you know there's some accidents here but we got shotguns, there's a toxic hazard, there's a chocolate and eggs being cooked up too.
[106:23.00]Chocolate and eggs?
[106:25.00]Yeah, it's- it's good. But here's where it gets interesting, because there's not only explosive it's radioactive.
[106:31.00]It's radioactive.
[106:32.00]To really sell- and to really sell this house home Jerma I just want to tell you one thing.
[106:35.00]Yeah?
[106:36.00]What's better than a baby with a gun and peace near a fireplace with explosives?
[106:44.83]I think there are quite a few things that are that would be better than that. I think uh- I think philosophy might have to take a little bit of a nosedive on this one just because that's uh that's very dangerous.
[106:54.60]And uh and there's also somebody's uh severed limb over there as well I believe. Is that somebody? Is that-
[107:01.60]It's good right?
[107:03.60]I mean- I- it's dangerous, I don't know if good would be the answer but dangerous is definitely up there.
[107:08.00]But you could get points for creativity.
[107:10.00]Dangerously fun?
[107:11.00]Yeah, I see. I'm feeling you. I feel you. Okay.
[107:14.91]Okay.
[107:16.09]I think I'm ready to grade you.
[107:18.09]Okay.
[107:18.62]I think I'm ready.
[107:20.26]Remember.
[107:21.46]Remember.
[107:22.66]Remember.
[107:23.00]Happy 60th.
[107:24.66]We are going to go for creativity.
[107:27.10]Joel, I think you actually did a lot.
[107:29.06]There was a lot of time and placement that went into this.
[107:33.27]I'm going to give you for creativity, I'm going to give you
[107:39.52]Because of the amount of objects that you placed, the amount of individual objects that had to be physically placed, you're going to get a 94 for your creativity.
[107:51.51]94 for creativity.
[107:53.16]I think you actually did quite a lot.
[107:55.85]I think it was very, very wonderful.
[107:57.37]I think you did a lot of good placement.
[107:58.89]I like, I love the corn.
[107:59.85]I like the fact that you actually did garden.
[108:02.00]Your complexity is also going to be a little bit high because your complexity isn't... There was a full thought out maze part of this house, which gives you some points.
[108:13.49]The complexity of, you know, Jerma's not as tall as his door.
[108:16.61]I mean, and like, you know, the Green Goblin.
[108:18.99]It's not that complex.
[108:21.67]I do appreciate the fact that you did put a gnome next to that to be able to show that I am, in fact, over, you know, more than four feet tall.
[108:27.90]That's unrelated.
[108:29.56]This is unrelated.
[108:30.20]And if you feel that way, that's not deductible on points.
[108:33.32]I'm going to give you an 80.
[108:34.08]I'm going to give you an 82 on complexity and structure.
[108:38.46]I think it was still good.
[108:40.71]I think you get an 82 on that.
[108:41.83]That's a solid B. That's a solid B minus.
[108:44.72]Your cleanliness was very good.
[108:47.24]I don't see any trash in the yard.
[108:48.32]Could you do me a quick favor, though?
[108:49.18]Could you go to where the, um... Go to where the... Where's the garage?
[108:55.07]Hang on.
[108:55.39]Like, the actual garage.
[108:57.23]Yeah, I need, like, the garage.
[108:59.07]Because I need you to go to the left of the garage.
[109:00.57]No, actually, no, that's clear.
[109:01.27]That's clear.
[109:03.19]The spiders are going to take some points off, unfortunately, because it's, you know, you didn't clean that up beforehand.
[109:08.93]Also, I think that having explosives everywhere could be very dangerous and make a big mess.
[109:14.35]I'm going to have to give you a 75 on cleanliness.
[109:17.13]Okay.
[109:18.51]I think that's a solid C, considering that there were spiders everywhere.
[109:21.18]There were rats everywhere.
[109:22.90]It's not very clean, necessarily.
[109:24.88]I mean, it's pretty complex.
[109:26.12]It's pretty creative.
[109:27.30]But I'm going to have to give you a 75 on cleanliness.
[109:29.84]Okay, I'll take that.
[109:31.50]Your philosophy and theming, I'm gonna give you a... I'm gonna give you an 86.
[109:34.06]Okay.
[109:34.58]I think you deserve an 86.
[109:37.32]I think that was a solid B. Well... I'll give you a... I'm gonna give you a 90.
[109:44.76]Actually.
[109:45.50]Because you did have... You did have a pretty good theme here.
[109:48.16]As much as I, uh, you know, the green goblin, you had a pretty good theme.
[109:52.22]Alright, it's time for chat's grade.
[109:54.93]Chat, what is your grade?
[109:57.27]You have to pick.
[109:58.86]It has to be 95, 85, 75, 65.
[110:04.10]Those are your choices.
[110:06.36]Joel, I think you did a hell of a job.
[110:08.04]Those of you that opened up Joel's stream would have seen the high-quality version.
[110:11.14]We got to see a good PlayStation 2 version, which I think actually added to it, so that's why I gave you more points for creativity.
[110:18.09]And I think we can see what they want to do.
[110:20.13]Can we get the poll going?
[110:20.97]Mm-hmm.
[110:23.12]that got you lots of that adding your own audio track is is a huge deal that's your own audio track in the game that's how you got a 94 in creativity what do we got what does chat want to give you wow chat is saying a 95 from chat for Joel wow Joel that brings your total grade that is worth 10 of your total grade
[110:50.47]Joel, you're at an 87.6 is your final grade.
[110:55.05]That's a B+.
[110:56.78]Okay.
[110:57.56]Okay.
[110:59.70]That's a B+, for Joel.
[111:02.22]Okay.
[111:03.66]87.6 for Joel.
[111:06.14]I just want to let you all know that I'm very happy to be part of this
[111:10.54]you know, opportunity to show off and not necessarily show off in a sort of, you know, narcissistic way, but rather, you know, show everybody that my hard drive is running out of space for some reason.
[111:24.60]Anyway, whatever.
[111:26.12]My point is, I worked really hard on this, and I think...
[111:32.42]Well, we'll see.
[111:55.31]Yeah, we'll see.
[111:56.09]We'll see.
[111:56.77]But I just want to thank you all for, you know, looking at my house.
[111:59.99]And I want to thank the Boogler himself for giving such a high rank.
[112:04.86]Honestly, the lower bitrate actually added to it for me.
[112:08.83]It really did.
[112:12.28]Oh, yeah.
[112:12.54]Thanks a lot, Joel.
[112:13.50]Joel, it was a pleasure.
[112:15.61]Thank you for showing your house.
[112:16.77]It was phenomenal.
[112:17.89]Everybody say thank you to Joel.
[112:20.45]Hope you had fun.
[112:21.85]Thank you, guys.
[112:22.61]Thank you, Joel.
[112:24.63]If we want to talk, anybody want to say anything about Joel's house before we move on to C-Dog?
[112:30.59]Is anyone else going to get the points benefit for PS2 graphics in the Discord preview?
[112:36.84]I feel like his house is perfect for the PS2 graphics, though.
[112:40.24]It really is.
[112:40.82]It couldn't have worked better.
[112:41.94]I think that's why... Walls?
[112:45.42]Wait, what did he say?
[112:47.37]Nothing.
[112:48.03]I just spent most of my time painting the outside of my house, and I realized I should have just put in funny decor.
[112:52.49]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[112:53.69]Lud, Lud, Lud.
[112:54.75]I'm a stupid idiot.
[112:57.04]I'm a stupid idiot.
[112:58.22]Lud, listen.
[112:58.92]I used the paint gun, and I grappled too, Connor.
[113:00.86]I had to grapple.
[113:01.84]He's so wrong.
[113:02.70]He's such an idiot.
[113:03.56]I'm such an idiot.
[113:04.38]He doesn't know how wrong he is.
[113:05.94]I should have hung spiders.
[113:07.91]He doesn't know how wrong he is.
[113:10.15]I don't have a single rat in my house.
[113:12.11]I don't have a single rat in my house.
[113:15.01]Ludwig.
[113:16.19]He had so many ill references.
[113:18.07]It was so tight.
[113:18.99]You're going to get so many more points for painting the outside of your house because he's the only fucking person that did it.
[113:23.08]No, just keep going.
[113:23.48]Just go check out Doug's house.
[113:24.82]Alright.
[113:25.78]CDawg, you're up next.
[113:27.00]Are you ready?
[113:28.58]Oh, by the way, we can change the quality here potentially.
[113:31.62]Under your stream quality settings, set stream quality to better text readability.
[113:36.19]It might actually increase the bit rate.
[113:39.25]Oh, is that on Discord?
[113:40.55]I believe so.
[113:41.47]And if you're streaming at the highest quality, stream it at 30.
[113:43.43]Is this Nitro?
[113:44.11]Oh, it's a community server.
[113:46.15]I didn't see this.
[113:47.74]We got HD streaming.
[113:49.42]Yeah, so if we can do... When you do your stream, do it at 30 FPS rather than 60.
[113:55.60]Try to go at the highest quality and do that text-readable thing at 30 FPS.
[114:00.82]Who's the other person streaming in the Discord?
[114:02.82]I can't see it because the dot-dot-dots.
[114:05.76]Oh, just only have me do it?
[114:07.14]Yeah.
[114:09.18]So if you want to watch, maybe open up the person's stream that's currently doing it.
[114:13.64]Are they just watching through JermaStream?
[114:15.50]Yeah.
[114:15.96]That's probably the best way to do it.
[114:18.15]Okay.
[114:18.61]So Joel, you should turn your screen share off, Joel, because we're moving on to C-Dog.
[114:23.11]So C-Dog, did you... Oh my God, I muted this whole time.
[114:26.27]Oh my God, I'm an idiot.
[114:27.41]Oh my God.
[114:28.43]I was talking to you guys for like five minutes.
[114:31.58]We heard you.
[114:33.02]Alright.
[114:34.10]Are we ready to... Can you see me?
[114:37.28]I can.
[114:37.60]Let me just make sure it actually looks okay first before we move on.
[114:39.88]Yeah.
[114:40.30]Tell me how many P's is that?
[114:42.60]I was offering 100.
[114:43.86]It actually looks pretty good.
[114:45.66]It actually looks good.
[114:47.86]This looks great.
[114:49.58]Okay.
[114:51.80]So the Discord screen sharing is kind of giving me a seizure, but that's fine.
[114:55.65]I can still do the tour and my chat doesn't see it.
[114:57.15]So I'm fine to suffer.
[114:58.19]Okay.
[114:58.59]Are you sure?
[114:59.09]Yeah, because it looks pretty good.
[115:00.37]Just bear in mind that I'm fighting that for you when you're grading.
[115:03.87]I got it.
[115:04.21]I got it.
[115:04.49]I got you.
[115:04.85]Alright.
[115:05.13]We're ready.
[115:05.39]How are you doing?
[115:07.03]I'm doing good.
[115:07.39]Do you want to see the outside first?
[115:08.59]Is that where we normally start on these things?
[115:10.33]Yeah, you are free to give me the tour however you'd like to.
[115:13.22]Alright, so let's have a look.
[115:14.20]Let's have a look how clean the garden is.
[115:16.14]You know, we've, I've gone for a minimalist approach with the garden.
[115:21.00]By minimalist, you mean you removed everything?
[115:24.37]Well, yeah, but that's what I thought it meant.
[115:27.85]So you took cleanliness as get rid of every single plant?
[115:31.99]Well, yeah, because there's stuff that lives in dirt that's dirty, like worms and stuff.
[115:36.39]So I wanted to get rid of the grass that they would live in.
[115:38.81]Okay.
[115:39.51]Alright.
[115:40.11]Show me your process.
[115:40.59]I left the trees, mainly because I couldn't burn them down.
[115:43.93]Oh, I could have cut them.
[115:45.15]I left them intentionally.
[115:48.31]So you tried to burn them down.
[115:49.71]It didn't work.
[115:50.23]Okay.
[115:52.34]I get you.
[115:52.86]I thought if God wanted them there, the flamethrower surely would have kept them.
[115:56.84]Here's the thing.
[115:57.64]Here's the thing.
[115:58.22]It is clean.
[116:00.26]It is very clean.
[116:01.60]Extremely clean.
[116:02.57]Not a single weed around.
[116:04.07]Very clean.
[116:05.33]Exceptionally clean.
[116:08.71]Ooh, okay.
[116:09.69]Alright.
[116:10.13]Alright.
[116:10.47]Okay.
[116:10.79]Alright.
[116:10.99]There is some patches, but they just grew back over time.
[116:13.66]I did actually get rid of these initially.
[116:15.56]But this grew back.
[116:17.66]This grew back in the time that you were doing?
[116:19.14]Okay.
[116:19.42]Alright.
[116:20.72]Yeah, it did.
[116:21.20]It did.
[116:21.91]Very clean.
[116:22.45]Ignore the wall.
[116:23.91]Yeah, looks alright.
[116:25.65]I would have liked some shrubbery if it was possible.
[116:28.69]I would have liked a little bit of... I left this one in here.
[116:31.05]Yeah, okay.
[116:33.34]Mainly because I couldn't remove it.
[116:35.82]So I did leave that in.
[116:36.92]Okay.
[116:40.62]So are you ready for the tour?
[116:42.12]I am ready for the tour.
[116:44.63]I love it.
[116:44.95]You're spending a lot of time in the outside.
[116:47.03]What the fuck is happening here?
[116:53.14]You've got the green M&M thinking about societal collapse and balls.
[116:57.62]Alright.
[116:58.14]And I love how there's like the ad of the person who actually like where you got that picture from.
[117:02.24]So it's good credit.
[117:03.34]You got credit there.
[117:04.38]That's actually very thoughtful of you.
[117:06.12]We credit the artists here on this channel.
[117:07.90]Okay.
[117:09.16]We have an image of me pointing to the enter.
[117:13.86]Oh, that's you at the entrance.
[117:16.16]It's me in a maid outfit.
[117:17.60]This happens a lot, actually, on my streams and content.
[117:20.14]So I thought it would be a fun callback.
[117:22.48]Okay.
[117:22.98]I'm so sorry.
[117:28.00]I have other... So you actually, you did, you did an exterior.
[117:36.46]I will give you credit for that.
[117:37.68]You did a very elaborate exterior.
[117:40.79]Yeah, you know, I... Sorry to interrupt you.
[117:44.45]I didn't mean to.
[117:44.89]I just wanted to... Oh, no, it's your tour.
[117:46.33]It's your tour.
[117:46.91]Please give me your philosophy.
[117:47.93]I need to hear it.
[117:48.87]You are essentially the guy that we all are here to impress.
[117:54.60]And I noticed that in a lot of my favorite countries, they tend to have pictures of the guy in charge on walls.
[118:01.64]So I thought, well, why don't I mimic that and have the, you know, the biggest mural be of the guy in charge?
[118:08.83]Right, but you... I'm going to have to dock you a little bit of points on this because you went less like Rembrandt painting to show how interesting and amazing I look to more like the guy melting at the end of Indiana Jones.
[118:22.33]I think that's a little bit of a point deduction.
[118:26.39]It was the first one that came up on Google.
[118:29.35]What did you type?
[118:33.47]What did you type?
[118:34.23]What do you mean that's the first thing that came up on Google?
[118:36.25]What did you type into Google?
[118:40.03]It's the Japanese Google.
[118:41.94]It's different.
[118:43.24]It's a different Google.
[118:44.32]Alright.
[118:44.90]Okay.
[118:45.22]I'm feeling it.
[118:46.56]If you tried it now, it wouldn't work.
[118:49.20]Okay.
[118:50.18]Okay.
[118:50.66]Alright.
[118:50.94]I'm feeling it.
[118:52.04]Okay.
[118:52.30]So I will preface.
[118:53.42]Actually, no.
[118:53.84]You know what?
[118:54.40]I won't preface.
[118:54.92]I won't tell you.
[118:57.76]Okay.
[118:59.70]Having that dog in me.
[119:00.92]Okay.
[119:02.56]Okay.
[119:05.37]We blocked this off because I just didn't want it.
[119:09.49]I was tired of doors.
[119:11.09]Wait, you didn't even put a door?
[119:12.01]No, no, no.
[119:13.77]There's a door.
[119:15.65]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[119:16.37]It's another door.
[119:17.17]Can you get into the house?
[119:19.41]That structural integrity is going to see you at least at a C right now.
[119:24.65]Well, no, no, no, no, no.
[119:25.45]You can get in the house.
[119:26.45]You can get in the house.
[119:27.23]Wait, you can get in the house?
[119:28.21]Okay.
[119:28.35]Of course you can get in the house.
[119:29.99]What kind of asshole would I be if I made a house without doors?
[119:32.23]True.
[119:32.51]You know, I've been living in Japan now for a while.
[119:35.36]And I've been I've been concerned with earthquakes.
[119:37.62]And I just thought that these doors here were they were just a hazard waiting to happen.
[119:43.48]So I blocked those off.
[119:44.64]Okay.
[119:45.53]I don't even know what this is.
[119:47.03]I'll be honest with you.
[119:49.19]I just put it up there.
[119:50.13]Okay, was this like the first picture in like the folder of the meme folder you have on your desktop?
[119:56.90]I asked the viewers, because I didn't have time to get them, I asked the viewers to send me memes, and some of them aren't great.
[120:03.50]Connor, Connor, you asked for memes?
[120:08.01]Yeah, I didn't have, I didn't know we could put memes in the game until I got in.
[120:13.19]That's true, that's true.
[120:14.69]I improvised.
[120:16.95]Okay, but creativity is going to see a little bit of a hit on that one, just a little.
[120:20.70]It's creative because I'm going beyond my means, right?
[120:25.58]This is left by the previous contractor.
[120:27.18]This isn't me.
[120:28.84]Even though it's the color of the paint of the outside of the house, you didn't do that.
[120:33.16]I didn't do it.
[120:34.48]The contractor left it there.
[120:35.98]Okay.
[120:36.30]Got it.
[120:36.60]Got it.
[120:36.90]I see.
[120:37.12]They leave stuff all the time.
[120:39.98]Right.
[120:40.65]So...
[120:41.96]Why are you laughing?
[120:43.12]This is serious.
[120:44.94]Because this is not even a house.
[120:48.57]This is just walls with giant pictures on them.
[120:52.33]Alright, let's go.
[120:53.43]No, no, no.
[120:56.35]This is so much more than that.
[120:58.09]Okay.
[120:58.43]Alright, I'll let you go.
[120:59.31]What I have.
[120:59.86]Okay.
[121:00.64]First of all, I find that the concept.
[121:05.16]Okay, first of all.
[121:05.66]Alright.
[121:10.73]Okay, wait, before you go any further.
[121:13.15]Is there furniture in your house?
[121:15.96]Yes.
[121:16.50]Okay.
[121:18.68]There actually is furniture.
[121:19.78]There actually is.
[121:20.44]Alright, okay.
[121:22.18]So let me... I'm sorry.
[121:23.66]I'm laughing too hard.
[121:24.77]I can't present seriously.
[121:26.49]Alright, okay.
[121:27.23]So in the house, right, I decided...
[121:31.40]that because you were talking about creativity you were talking about complexity I thought why not merge the two com concepts into one uh and take some you know take some uh kind of ideas from some of the properties that I enjoy so I decided that okay well I'm a big fan of fun
[121:48.88]elaborate mazes that kind of uh you know they kind of you think you're on the right way but you're in the wrong way I mean it's a whole point of a maze but I thought it would be fun because oftentimes in modern house design it's all about knocking the walls down I thought no why don't we put more walls just so many walls that it's actually just inconvenient to live there but in fact I did I did leave these here because I you know I'm not a monster I want you to be able to charge your phone
[122:14.38]And then I decorated it with Some pictures that I found okay, so it's an it's an anti open concept room an unopened room.
[122:22.80]You can say okay So it's a maze the whole house is a maze And you have to kind of the back rooms is that painted the entire thing.
[122:32.63]Hold on.
[122:32.87]Why is calm Nintendo music playing right now?
[122:36.57]You did that
[122:40.34]I was about to go, holy shit.
[122:42.08]I was like, wow, creative.
[122:43.14]Wow.
[122:43.42]Where can we turn this corner?
[122:44.58]You got your own audio.
[122:46.84]I put that in actually.
[122:50.20]So, you know, have you, are you familiar with the brutalistic styles of, uh, Svavich?
[122:56.18]No, but let's continue.
[122:59.04]So we're in the first hallway.
[123:00.78]Yeah, where do you want to go in the maze?
[123:02.94]Do you want to go forward or do you want to turn?
[123:04.29]I would like to turn right because I see that this... A little bit of a structural integrity complexity issue up here.
[123:10.67]What's going on here?
[123:11.29]No, this is part of the frights.
[123:13.93]I left this here.
[123:15.60]That's intentional.
[123:17.28]Yeah, I left this here.
[123:19.05]I remodeled the entire floor.
[123:21.35]I had to knock down all the walls.
[123:22.71]I had to border off everything.
[123:23.83]I got rid of all the windows.
[123:24.85]They're all gone.
[123:25.99]And I left this here as a kind of a keepsake of the previous owner who was kind enough to sell me this house.
[123:32.18]I wanted to just have something.
[123:33.28]Also, it's terrifying when you walk in because, you know, the fact that you could scrape your head, boom, like that, you know.
[123:37.46]I mean, I'm going to let you slide on that one because that was an unbelievable bullshit.
[123:41.38]That was unbelievable.
[123:42.28]I'll let you slide on that one.
[123:44.17]Thank you.
[123:45.33]So you want to turn right?
[123:46.17]I would like to turn right.
[123:48.30]Would you like to keep progressing forward?
[123:54.13]I would like to continue to go forward.
[123:55.65]Yes, I would.
[123:56.15]Okay.
[123:58.99]I would like you to stop and go back.
[124:01.17]Okay, okay.
[124:01.57]I would like you to quickly explain what is going on with the wall on the left here.
[124:06.40]Like, turn around?
[124:08.18]What's happening on here?
[124:09.00]This is a structural integrity and complexity issue.
[124:12.07]No, no, so the... As you can see by the mini-map, don't look at it too much there, but this is purely just here as... You saw the... I shouldn't have pointed that out.
[124:22.45]I saw the mini-map right when you said that.
[124:24.37]Okay, alright.
[124:25.91]I'll keep my mouth shut.
[124:27.57]You can see that...
[124:29.61]uh it's the entire design philosophy is to restrict the space we're so all the time everyone is talking about I want a big house how much square footage no one's thought about how much square footage can I have and how much can I make it useless so I think it's a it's a fun concept to just start restricting space in an awkward way so now you can't even put anything here it's just it's just inconvenient you know wondering why why is that there
[124:57.07]I actually understand that.
[124:58.65]I get it.
[124:59.63]I'm just trying to get a little more of your video up.
[125:01.67]There we go.
[125:03.12]Yeah.
[125:03.36]Okay.
[125:03.70]So I would like to turn around again.
[125:05.50]Okay.
[125:07.58]I would like you to go straight.
[125:09.62]Okay.
[125:10.26]I would like for you to turn right at the end of this.
[125:12.74]Okay.
[125:13.28]Okay.
[125:13.56]I would like you to go in this room and I'd like you to just... Okay.
[125:17.19]So this is... What was this going to be?
[125:19.49]Oh, no, this is the whole point.
[125:22.25]It's just like to signal that you've gone the wrong way.
[125:24.85]Oh, but you didn't put, like, a piece of cheese down on the ground.
[125:27.25]Creativity points deducted by two.
[125:30.35]Why would I reward them for going the wrong way?
[125:32.02]They're idiots.
[125:32.58]Piece of cheese not on the ground.
[125:33.50]That's deducted by two points in creativity.
[125:34.96]You can clearly see that it's not painted, thus you must not go this way.
[125:39.04]Connor, there's no cheese on the ground.
[125:40.12]I'm sorry.
[125:40.96]Why?
[125:42.40]Is there cheese in this game?
[125:43.70]Let me pull up the tablet right now.
[125:44.80]There's no cheese.
[125:45.34]There's no way there's cheese.
[125:47.56]Yeah, there's cheese.
[125:49.52]There's no...
[125:52.16]Connor, I'm sorry.
[125:52.68]I didn't see that, actually.
[125:53.78]Sorry, okay.
[125:54.48]My bad.
[125:54.84]Sorry, I shouldn't have argued with you there.
[125:57.66]What is it?
[125:58.08]Well, I didn't even see what your pictures were.
[125:59.42]Alright, go back and let's do the rest of this.
[126:01.99]Alright, so you've chosen the right way.
[126:05.05]Congratulations.
[126:06.05]Okay.
[126:06.49]Thus signaled by the banana cocktail-esque wallpaper.
[126:11.19]I painted this entire goddamn maze, by the way.
[126:13.15]You'll see this.
[126:13.79]Okay.
[126:14.65]This is painstaking.
[126:17.33]This is, I don't know what this is.
[126:19.37]Just a meme image?
[126:20.07]Sorry, just a meme image?
[126:22.29]It's just a, yeah.
[126:23.31]Can I say, it hurts to be in your house.
[126:26.87]Why does it hurt?
[126:27.57]I feel like my shoulders, I have to go like this when I'm in your house.
[126:30.29]That's the point.
[126:30.73]That's the point of the house.
[126:31.67]Okay, alright.
[126:31.99]You're not supposed to be comfortable.
[126:32.99]It's my house.
[126:33.55]Get out of my house.
[126:34.51]Okay, alright.
[126:34.95]Keep going.
[126:35.25]Alright, so here's, we have another meme.
[126:37.63]It's sky raisins and jalapeños.
[126:42.44]Keep going.
[126:42.94]Keep going down this hallway.
[126:43.68]I would like to move forward.
[126:44.86]I would like to move forward.
[126:47.48]Okay, would you like to keep going forward, or would you like to turn?
[126:50.97]I want to turn right down this.
[126:52.17]Alright.
[126:55.11]Okay.
[126:55.57]Okay, and keep going just through here?
[126:57.85]Alright, we have... Why is it getting tighter and tighter and tighter in here?
[127:03.38]Yeah, I did that on purpose.
[127:04.98]I'm trying to make it as little room as possible.
[127:06.84]Okay, I don't know what that is, but you just keep going through that.
[127:10.02]That looks good.
[127:11.72]okay this Yoda uh the Yoda you got to get some creative points before this I don't is that pizza it was a cat with a pizza it is peanut butter you left another paint bucket on the ground Connor oh no that was it oh Connor Connor your complexity and structure grade right now is a 65. oh I'm sorry I'm sorry it just is
[127:37.25]I gotta get your grades up here.
[127:38.98]These are Joel's.
[127:40.52]Let's clear those.
[127:41.42]Because you're at a 68 in complexity right now.
[127:46.26]Oh no, really?
[127:47.20]Yeah.
[127:49.11]The thing about this part is that it's a skill check, because as you can see, I just got stuck on it there.
[127:53.39]And you have to actually clip through it to get through.
[127:56.09]You see I'm kind of stuck right now, but there we go, we got it.
[127:58.31]Okay, so now you're in.
[127:59.31]It's intentional.
[128:00.30]Skill check.
[128:01.69]Okay, so now, this is the second time you've used this image.
[128:05.10]I just want to make sure that's clear.
[128:06.34]Third, actually, but... Oh, third.
[128:08.06]It is third.
[128:09.30]It's an illusion.
[128:10.50]It's an illusion.
[128:11.26]So you come through, you're like, well, I just came this way.
[128:13.46]There's no way this... Oh, did I go the wrong way, perhaps?
[128:17.86]Right?
[128:18.76]Okay.
[128:19.20]Are we good to continue?
[128:20.52]We are good to continue.
[128:21.98]I'm getting my grades correct here, so far.
[128:25.69]Okay.
[128:27.91]I'm good to continue.
[128:30.60]What is that?
[128:32.18]You can use that.
[128:33.03]What does that mean, use?
[128:34.91]What do you mean?
[128:35.35]Press E on that.
[128:36.15]What does that mean?
[128:40.21]Oh.
[128:40.33]Okay.
[128:40.93]Okay.
[128:41.19]Alright.
[128:41.75]I get it.
[128:42.23]I get it.
[128:43.33]I'll change it to me.
[128:44.03]There we go.
[128:44.47]There we go.
[128:45.43]Oh.
[128:46.24]Right.
[128:46.44]I think that changes things a little.
[128:47.68]That stretched me in a uncomfortable way.
[128:51.00]Alright.
[128:51.82]Your creativity is... I got your creativity so far at a 72.
[128:55.06]That's a C. It's above a C. C minus.
[128:57.72]I think you can really... It goes higher, right?
[128:59.30]It can go higher.
[129:00.20]I just want to let you know that your philosophy right now, I'm going to give you a 95.
[129:02.70]Okay.
[129:04.20]And the reason why you're getting a 95 in philosophy is because you took this concept of walls and maze and you made it your entire house.
[129:12.65]I've yet to see a piece of furniture, by the way.
[129:14.93]I've yet to see a piece of furniture, by the way.
[129:16.78]You will see furniture, don't you worry.
[129:18.76]So we'll go forward and we can go this way, but there's nothing.
[129:22.06]You can just stand here and contemplate.
[129:24.12]You can also get a good view of this meme, which says, I'll allow you to read it.
[129:28.47]I look at the blood ocean sometimes and think for real that's where the government is sending me in a windowless submarine as capital punishment for the greater good of the human race there is something outside I'm gonna have to give you a 70 on creativity I I could I couldn't even tell I couldn't read what's going on here uh
[129:47.22]Okay, so I'll give you, I'm going to drop the point.
[129:48.78]Actually, I'll give you 71.
[129:51.38]Nah, 73.
[129:51.96]I'll give you 73.
[129:52.84]I appreciate that.
[129:55.04]So I can go this way, right?
[129:56.36]Yep.
[129:57.46]We also missed a completely, this is the main branch.
[130:00.24]I'll just spoil it for you.
[130:01.16]Okay.
[130:01.96]There was another branch as well that you missed.
[130:03.70]Oh, show me, show me.
[130:04.62]Please do, please do.
[130:06.38]let me just it's going to take a minute actually I got to go through all this we do have about a 10 minute time limit for every contestant but it's okay but it's alright I think we can go over for for a lot of these it's fine as long as everyone's cool with chilling for another you know 30 minutes or so yeah this is the other part of the maze it's very clean it's very clean extremely I mean it has to be the whole thing is yellow walls it kind of has to you have to get a 100 for clean
[130:34.18]Well, no other life form can live here, actually.
[130:37.55]There's so much asbestos and paint.
[130:40.43]It's actually important.
[130:41.31]I'm going to do the skill check real quick.
[130:42.49]Hold up.
[130:43.73]Can you not even go through your house?
[130:45.80]No.
[130:46.58]Like I said, it's a skill check.
[130:47.50]So anyone real game is going past this point.
[130:49.28]Okay.
[130:49.68]That's actually kind of cool.
[130:51.74]Yeah, I think you're, I'll give you, I'm going to give you a 75 for creativity, because given a skill check, an FPS skill check to go through your house is actually pretty, that's interesting.
[131:01.15]So we have another meme image here.
[131:04.49]Okay, near on butt.
[131:08.61]Yeah, don't worry about it.
[131:09.31]Is that Bernie Sanders right there?
[131:10.33]Is that Bernie Sanders?
[131:11.77]On the left?
[131:12.45]No, this is hide the pen howl in RTX.
[131:16.60]It wasn't Bernie Sanders.
[131:19.12]Would you have preferred it to be Bernie Sanders?
[131:21.68]I just thought it was, and that made me laugh for a second.
[131:24.48]I had to change it.
[131:25.92]And so now I really take the concept of uncomfortable, you know, kind of an alleyways to an extreme here by making it literally just, you know, it's the limit you can actually walk.
[131:36.16]I'm actually surprised you did this in an hour.
[131:39.08]Yeah, this is crazy, right?
[131:42.01]You did this in an hour.
[131:43.75]Yeah, I did.
[131:44.19]I painted all the fucking walls.
[131:46.46]I'm a psychopath.
[131:47.34]I hate myself.
[131:48.00]Okay.
[131:49.72]Yeah, you painted all the walls.
[131:51.59]You really did.
[131:52.59]You painted every single wall this color.
[131:55.48]Yeah, that's dedication.
[131:56.60]It took nine hours.
[131:58.48]Actually, I started attending.
[132:01.10]That's why I came in the call.
[132:02.12]I was begging you.
[132:02.72]I was like, there's got to be a faster way.
[132:04.46]Please tell me.
[132:07.10]There's not.
[132:07.66]There wasn't.
[132:10.22]So I'm very curious about what's up here on the right.
[132:13.08]And that's why I'd like you to go open this right door.
[132:16.66]yeah yeah okay we got in the image that's pretty cool keep going the maze gets even even more uncomfortable now we're just we're alright go through the maze go through the maze okay very easy to get lost here we are now we're in the lost damn it hold up which way was it this way no no this is I'm going back okay no I know it's the wrong way
[132:40.13]It's such a complex maze.
[132:41.27]It's so easy to get lost.
[132:42.77]The complexity is easily 100, I think, actually.
[132:45.74]That's just my rating.
[132:46.46]Complexity might have to go up a little.
[132:47.84]Okay.
[132:48.18]So there's a stair here.
[132:49.88]And the best part about this stair, when you go up it, it's purely aesthetic because it's completely useless.
[132:55.52]There's nothing up here!
[132:56.32]No, no, no, no, no.
[132:58.14]There is.
[132:58.38]There is.
[132:58.66]There absolutely is.
[133:00.06]Okay.
[133:00.60]Alright.
[133:00.86]Well, I like the aesthetic.
[133:01.95]It's not going to change your score or anything, but I like the aesthetic.
[133:05.05]Okay.
[133:05.66]What the fuck is this?
[133:06.30]Above me, Scoob.
[133:07.98]You got a Scooby-Doo?
[133:09.08]You got a Scooby-Doo meme in here?
[133:10.18]We're going to take your philosophy down by a few points.
[133:13.88]What?
[133:14.30]It's the part of the flame!
[133:16.26]Okay, so we go... Now that we've finished this floor, it's to signal that you're near the end.
[133:20.88]I've decided to go for a blank aesthetic for the rest of the maze.
[133:23.91]Okay.
[133:25.54]Also, I was running out of paint and time.
[133:27.47]Okay.
[133:28.17]Sorry, let me close this.
[133:30.35]So, you go through now.
[133:31.37]This is where the doors come into effect.
[133:33.31]I'm trying to constrict it with a new method now.
[133:35.25]What did you fucking make?
[133:37.64]Alright.
[133:38.66]It's a new way of constricting.
[133:39.94]So, go through here.
[133:42.14]Was that Final Fantasy?
[133:43.72]Alright, Final Fantasy.
[133:44.86]What is going on in this picture?
[133:48.33]I don't know.
[133:53.40]Where is the furniture?
[133:55.89]Show me the furniture.
[133:56.77]Show me the room with the furniture right now.
[133:58.70]This is the final... Are you sure you want to continue?
[134:01.36]We give you a chance to end it all.
[134:03.12]Because it can be tough.
[134:04.62]This is the... And also, I couldn't build a wall here.
[134:07.12]But this is your final get out.
[134:08.81]If you... And also, you get stuck if the doors are closed.
[134:11.01]So you... I actually kind of like that.
[134:12.61]You made the haunted house thing where, like, if you want to leave... It's like, no, no, you can get out of here.
[134:16.81]Like, I'm scared.
[134:17.67]There's an exit here.
[134:18.51]I get it.
[134:18.83]Okay.
[134:19.05]I like it.
[134:19.49]Are you really sure you want to see what's coming up?
[134:21.43]Because it's bad.
[134:22.81]Yeah, that changes things a little for me.
[134:25.55]So, you know, it's true to life and also safety regulations.
[134:28.91]We had to have an exit.
[134:29.91]Okay.
[134:31.27]So let's go.
[134:31.87]Okay.
[134:32.11]You also get clipped on the door, so you have to open them.
[134:33.91]It's actually kind of, it's kind of a great thing that you have to consider.
[134:37.87]I love how there's two doors that go to the same place.
[134:41.69]Yes.
[134:42.43]I thought it was more dramatic.
[134:44.23]Alright.
[134:44.51]Here we go.
[134:45.41]Is this the final room?
[134:51.50]There is another room.
[134:52.50]Of course, there's another room.
[134:53.38]But this is the prelude.
[134:55.66]um it says I'll let you I'll let you read this alright sometimes the side if you can't even a chick it's c-dog va scrump dill dumpsters dump truck this is your live reaction to that
[135:13.52]I'm going to give you an extra point in complexity.
[135:16.14]I took some points down for creativity.
[135:18.16]There's also this plant matter on the ground.
[135:21.57]I'm going to read down on cleanliness a little bit here.
[135:23.53]This plant matter on the ground.
[135:25.67]They're in jars, so it's extremely clean because there's no dirt.
[135:30.81]It's all self-contained.
[135:32.10]Do you see any of the dirt outside?
[135:35.28]Because I don't.
[135:36.36]It's extremely clean.
[135:37.56]That is pretty clean.
[135:39.20]We need some oxygen generation.
[135:42.01]Alright, what's the last room?
[135:43.02]Let's see it.
[135:43.38]There's actually another door.
[135:48.30]You just, like, put walls up and put doors on them and, like, made a gigantic fucking maze.
[135:53.54]It's a philosophy.
[135:55.16]At 100 points.
[135:56.22]There's the furniture.
[135:59.23]It's one couch.
[136:00.35]Alright.
[136:00.79]I'm gonna have to... Here we go.
[136:02.14]No, no, no.
[136:03.24]It's the casting couch.
[136:04.86]Look, Shrek is signaling what could be happening here.
[136:06.80]Okay, alright.
[136:07.28]I'm gonna have to... I do appreciate the maze.
[136:09.40]The maze is very, very interesting.
[136:11.80]Look, if you were to tell me I got an hour and 20 minutes to do something, I don't know if an elaborate maze would be the first thing I would do.
[136:18.13]I would focus on building a room.
[136:20.11]You don't have any rooms.
[136:20.91]You've got zero rooms.
[136:21.47]It's all one room.
[136:26.05]No, no, this is one room.
[136:27.79]This is two rooms.
[136:28.97]This is three rooms.
[136:30.22]So I'm going to give you, here's my grades for you.
[136:31.86]And we're going to get chat's grade.
[136:32.74]Chad, if we could go ahead and get chat's grade.
[136:34.08]Remember, it's A, B, C, or D. I'm going to look at what they're saying.
[136:38.32]I want to see how they're feeling about this.
[136:40.25]I feel like A, for sure.
[136:41.67]Well, actually, there are a couple of A's.
[136:43.39]I've seen a few B's.
[136:44.89]Why are people saying A?
[136:45.71]Are you serious?
[136:49.97]It's A. It's got to be an A at least.
[136:51.13]There's no way.
[136:51.69]There's no chance.
[136:52.25]That's great.
[136:53.45]You can't give anything lower than a D. Sorry.
[136:58.52]A+.
[136:59.12]Come on, guys.
[137:01.68]Here's what I got you at.
[137:02.42]I got you at a 70 for... I got you at a C for creativity.
[137:05.56]Well, actually, I'm going to give you 75.
[137:07.04]I think that you had a... I like the maze idea.
[137:10.67]I'll give you 75 for creativity.
[137:12.99]I've got you at a 69 for complexity.
[137:15.67]because uh I mean it's arguably the most complex uh house that you'll see all day I mean the amount of walls and redecoration and painting it's extremely complex I got you at an 86 for cleanliness I've got you at an 85 for philosophy because I do think you had a you did have a pretty uh you had a good theme here you've stuck with the theme completely so chat's grade is
[137:38.57]I just, if I may ask, the cleanliness, I mean, I find it hard to believe it's not 100.
[137:43.39]Not to, you know, obviously disagree with your ruling on this, but I just, where were those 14 points?
[137:48.20]Where have they gone?
[137:50.14]uh so the cleanliness problem was there was two paint cans on the ground and the issue with the paint cans is you did you'd had a good cover for the first one but the second one was there also skill check it was it you know I'll get I'll give you I'll give you an 89 for cleanliness alright thank you thank you I think that works and then chat's grade is uh nobody can get lower than a 60 uh Connor I'm sorry they have given you an f
[138:14.25]What?
[138:14.73]Yeah, I get it.
[138:16.23]I don't like the maze.
[138:17.63]You didn't like the maze.
[138:18.58]What do you do?
[138:18.96]I could give him an F. How do they not like the maze?
[138:21.82]I don't know.
[138:22.96]I liked it.
[138:24.68]What?
[138:25.82]Oh my God.
[138:26.42]Well, fair enough.
[138:28.12]Your overall grade is actually not that bad.
[138:30.19]Your overall grade is a 75.6.
[138:31.57]That's a full C.
[138:35.75]For somebody that woke up at 4 o'clock in the morning to do this and learned how to play the game an hour ago, actually, great fucking job.
[138:41.75]Seriously.
[138:42.41]Thank you.
[138:43.07]I appreciate that.
[138:44.81]Thank you.
[138:45.07]I'll take the C. I'll take the C. Overall of a 75.6.
[138:47.19]Alright.
[138:48.13]I'll take it.
[138:49.85]I'll take it.
[138:50.29]Thank you so much for judging me.
[138:52.17]I appreciate it.
[138:53.23]Thanks for waking up early for this, Connor.
[138:55.73]No worries.
[138:56.23]We're excited to see the rest.
[139:02.69]Alright, that was CDawg.
[139:06.81]The next person we have is RT.
[139:08.23]RT is coming up here next.
[139:10.69]Oh, is it myself next?
[139:12.12]I thought I was until later.
[139:13.82]Oh, no, we did swap you.
[139:16.40]I'm just making sure that I can get around to everyone.
[139:21.04]Oh, wait, no, no, no.
[139:23.62]We swapped.
[139:24.24]Etalyx is here now, right?
[139:26.83]I believe that's who's here now.
[139:28.09]He's completely deafened.
[139:30.78]There we go, yeah.
[139:31.53]Hey!
[139:32.43]It's clear to go.
[139:34.12]Are you good?
[139:34.72]Are you ready?
[139:35.88]You want me to go?
[139:36.58]I mean, I'm happy to go.
[139:37.92]If you just give me one second here, I can set it up.
[139:40.81]I'm good right now.
[139:41.55]Are you good?
[139:42.01]Etalyx.
[139:42.21]You're good to stick around.
[139:43.17]Yeah.
[139:43.67]Alright.
[139:43.93]Alright.
[139:44.21]Let's go.
[139:44.83]Yeah.
[139:44.99]And we we're trying to keep these around 10 ish minutes.
[139:48.01]I know some of these are they're worth going around to.
[139:51.13]So, I mean, whatever.
[139:52.09]It's all good.
[139:52.57]Everyone should get 25 minutes now.
[139:54.41]Everybody should get 20 minutes.
[139:56.72]Wait.
[139:56.92]No, I'm sorry.
[139:57.68]But limit the rest of us to like less time.
[140:00.22]We have a bargain, too.
[140:02.38]Sorry.
[140:02.86]My Discord completely crashed.
[140:04.96]Oh, shit.
[140:05.50]Alright.
[140:06.24]Well, Etalyx.
[140:06.82]Are you ready?
[140:07.66]I didn't I didn't mean to just be like put on the spot.
[140:09.56]It's like, right.
[140:10.00]I'm going home.
[140:10.64]I've got nothing to show.
[140:11.54]No, it's all good.
[140:12.13]Fantastic home.
[140:13.45]Oh, I cannot.
[140:14.03]I actually cannot wait to see yours.
[140:15.35]But Etalyx.
[140:16.17]You you want to go instead of because his Discord crush.
[140:19.17]Okay, I can do that.
[140:20.47]But we'll get you back in RT later.
[140:22.53]Alright, Alex, are you ready to put your fire away for your stream on?
[140:25.89]Let me make sure you can see it.
[140:31.31]Somebody we need to stop poke.
[140:34.52]Is Poke still building?
[140:35.90]Poke is still going.
[140:37.50]Did no one... Did anybody tell him to stop?
[140:41.28]He's still going?
[140:42.28]He's still going.
[140:43.12]Yeah, that's... We need to cut him off.
[140:47.39]Alright, cut.
[140:48.17]Poke, if you can hear us.
[140:48.87]Poke, if you can hear us, you need to stop building.
[140:50.99]Poke, you need to stop building.
[140:52.99]Poke, you have to stop building.
[140:55.21]Everyone's been trying to get a hold of him.
[140:58.39]He's just going.
[140:59.61]We tried.
[141:00.25]We pinged him like three times.
[141:01.84]That's so funny.
[141:03.58]Alright.
[141:04.36]So this is Etalyx.
[141:06.08]Yeah.
[141:06.34]Can you see everything?
[141:07.54]We can see, and we are very excited.
[141:09.88]Etalyx.
[141:10.88]Uh, the time.
[141:12.18]Oh, hey, poke.
[141:12.64]Yeah.
[141:12.74]You have to stop building.
[141:15.70]You said, you said 30 FPS, better text readability.
[141:19.47]Yeah.
[141:19.69]It looks, uh, it looks good on our end.
[141:22.24]Okay.
[141:23.06]Alright, Alex, to my home, I went for the detail oriented approach.
[141:29.09]And we have a completely clean yard.
[141:32.29]Oh, wait, hold on, restart, restart, restart.
[141:33.83]Can you redo it and take away the text readability?
[141:36.13]Because we might not need to do that.
[141:37.47]Because, like, we're both on the west coast.
[141:40.53]Oh, okay.
[141:43.20]We're good.
[141:43.52]We're good.
[141:43.78]We got starting over.
[141:45.06]We got it.
[141:45.38]We got it.
[141:47.88]So smoother video instead.
[141:49.91]Yeah, I think as long as you don't have to do the text mode thing.
[141:52.55]You just have to check that box.
[141:57.00]Okay, how is that?
[141:58.90]That looks better.
[142:00.04]Can you move around?
[142:02.78]Hey, alright.
[142:03.56]Looks good on our end.
[142:04.52]Okay, looks good.
[142:06.44]Alright, so what do we got?
[142:08.85]Alright, welcome to my plot.
[142:11.60]We've got turf laid down on the entire plot.
[142:15.12]You won't find any weeds.
[142:16.42]First of all, that's a full clap.
[142:18.36]That's a full clap.
[142:19.14]I can't believe you actually did this in 60 minutes, 70 minutes.
[142:23.65]This is 100% clean backyard.
[142:27.29]Wow.
[142:28.03]And I'll show you the corner as well.
[142:31.05]The turf changes as it gets in the back, but it's still turf.
[142:34.25]Okay.
[142:36.88]So there's no little ugly dirt spots.
[142:39.21]We have a nice suburban yard that we can have the kids go out and play.
[142:43.63]That sounds great.
[142:44.21]Alright.
[142:45.05]You're starting off at cleanliness.
[142:46.49]We're at 100 right now, by the way.
[142:50.19]And we tried to get a little custom with the house and give it some paneling, give it some paint.
[142:55.77]Now, let me take you inside.
[142:57.75]So I just learned how to play House Flipper yesterday, and I was under the impression that this is a House Flipper competition.
[143:08.40]So I have... Okay.
[143:09.70]Alright, that's... Oh, that's pretty damn good.
[143:14.90]I have to tell you.
[143:16.52]That's actually... For complexity's sake... Oh, yeah.
[143:20.70]Yeah.
[143:21.90]Alright, you're... Etalyx, you're... I gotta tell you.
[143:24.58]I gotta listen.
[143:25.28]I gotta tell you how complex this was.
[143:27.16]This is like a world first documented ability to do what you're seeing here.
[143:34.95]It's not on... How did you even get the furniture to go upside down?
[143:39.81]Um, hours of trying to figure out how to do it after we did it on accident.
[143:45.03]Okay.
[143:45.73]Okay.
[143:46.09]Alright.
[143:46.49]I'm feeling it.
[143:47.15]I put in the training.
[143:48.12]I put in the work.
[143:48.88]I put in the preparation.
[143:50.22]Um, but we, we knocked down all the walls and gave it some, you know, a little flare.
[143:56.46]You got, you got a nice little sliding door.
[143:59.04]So far you and Joel, you and Joel had different, uh, walls so far, except you might be noticing.
[144:04.32]Everybody's using the same paint.
[144:05.68]Everyone's got the same paint.
[144:07.77]That's because it's landlord beige, you know, it's just the default one to start with.
[144:12.59]Okay, okay.
[144:13.77]Give me some more.
[144:15.31]We got some water flowing uphill because this is the house that is flipped.
[144:21.23]Okay.
[144:23.07]And we got like a nice little dining area.
[144:24.94]There's a piano here so that you can enjoy an elegant presentation with your friends while you're having some food.
[144:32.98]Beautiful.
[144:34.26]Oh, you even got the... Did you do this through the whole house?
[144:37.16]Yes.
[144:38.19]Well, yes, but you're looking at the whole house.
[144:42.28]The majority of the time was spent making sure that all of the little details, like the exterior, were taken care of.
[144:50.80]And clean.
[144:52.70]It's extremely clean.
[144:54.06]Look at that sheen on the wood.
[144:55.78]You were the first person to show sheen on wood, by the way.
[144:59.75]So it took a long time to get all of the...
[145:04.11]Like we have a second floor paint job.
[145:06.03]We got paneling on the first exterior.
[145:09.17]Actually put in some windows and some sliding doors and like a proper front door.
[145:15.17]Got a nice little seating area with a big screen TV and some speakers.
[145:19.70]Is that an award on the table?
[145:20.86]Yeah, that's my award for getting first place.
[145:24.20]Oh, that's confidence.
[145:25.58]Yeah, that philosophy.
[145:26.50]I'm going to have to give you a 95 on that right now.
[145:29.50]That's honest to God.
[145:31.91]That's a philosophy.
[145:32.89]That is a vibe.
[145:33.99]And you're up very high right now.
[145:35.11]I just want to make sure you know that.
[145:37.93]Thank you.
[145:38.67]I appreciate being recognized.
[145:39.99]But sometimes overconfidence can be a little bit of a downfall.
[145:44.73]So philosophy is going from a 95 to a 93.
[145:49.34]Look at the fish.
[145:51.02]I can fill it with fish.
[145:51.78]Oh, you actually can go upside down.
[145:55.50]Oh, yeah.
[145:56.52]Wait, do that again.
[145:57.98]Hold on.
[146:00.17]I'm sorry.
[146:00.57]I got to apologize.
[146:01.49]We presented the house in the wrong way.
[146:08.84]I want to make sure I win the House Flipper competition.
[146:10.64]Etalyx.
[146:11.26]I don't know if anyone's going to beat you.
[146:14.61]come close I don't think anyone's gonna come if you'd like to sit and enjoy the TV or check on the neighbors outside through the front window yeah that was I mean I don't I mean what do I do about this this is bad this is this was Connor's grades hold on a second here we got you out of creativity we got you out of I got you out of 95 for creativity I got you at 100 for complexity I've got you at a 100 for cleanliness although this can come down from here
[146:45.72]well the cleanliness can't go down because this is I can show you the upstairs um that's what I'm concerned about so long there it took so long to get all these other beautiful details just so that um I I had to choose my focus that's true just trying to get the downstairs as much as possible in a very short amount of time but you know you've got like at least your urinals
[147:09.82]Oh, yeah.
[147:10.98]Just that reveal I got.
[147:11.56]That Flint reveal was huge.
[147:13.34]I'm the only one that's going to be living here.
[147:14.90]The urinals get dirty after a while, so you want to be able to switch to the other ones.
[147:19.44]Okay.
[147:21.46]I like it.
[147:23.08]I didn't do this.
[147:24.26]The sink is leaky.
[147:27.34]This is just fault.
[147:28.14]I'm taking this back.
[147:28.88]There's water damage underneath that.
[147:34.77]It's still under warranty.
[147:37.18]Okay.
[147:37.36]Alright.
[147:38.04]Can you go up or down, technically?
[147:40.60]I can.
[147:41.62]It's clean.
[147:42.36]Oh, but it's twisted that way.
[147:44.48]Alright.
[147:45.20]Yep.
[147:45.90]The majority of the time was spent...
[147:50.63]This was phenomenal.
[147:53.63]I will have to tell you, this is probably number one so far.
[147:57.21]But there is no number one.
[147:59.19]We scared off the moles outside.
[148:02.61]We dug up all the holes.
[148:03.97]There's no tires.
[148:05.02]There's no weeds.
[148:06.22]It is a clean cut all the way across.
[148:08.18]I was told the outside is very important.
[148:10.30]Where's the maze?
[148:13.18]Open the garage.
[148:15.68]I want to see in the garage and I want to see every corner of the garage.
[148:19.81]You didn't just put everything in here, right?
[148:20.93]You didn't just put all the chairs and stuff in here?
[148:22.41]No.
[148:23.39]You can actually put two cars in this two-car garage.
[148:26.39]Actually using for cars.
[148:32.40]There's going to be a very short... I'm going to emphasize brevity in my presentation.
[148:38.50]You've seen it.
[148:39.10]This is it.
[148:39.72]I got the house flipped house.
[148:42.63]I think... So, chat, what's your grade?
[148:45.07]Go ahead and give it A, B, C, or D. I'm going to have to go ahead and say that for your complexity.
[148:50.09]Complexity carries this the whole time.
[148:52.49]I think that you being able to flip that and turn it the way... That was an unbelievably huge deal.
[148:58.92]I think that one of the reasons why... Hold on.
[149:02.78]Oops.
[149:03.02]Okay.
[149:03.68]One of the reasons why you're going to be up there pretty high is because of the flip reveal.
[149:08.28]Not just the fact that you did flip it, but the fact that I and everybody watching thought... It was built entirely upside down.
[149:14.03]It was built entirely upside down.
[149:15.09]The things that are here was put upside down.
[149:17.73]That was a phenomenal presentation.
[149:19.23]You physically cannot do it without being upside down, and the way that you get upside down is actually so secret that it isn't even on the wiki for this game.
[149:28.23]We discovered it on accident.
[149:31.09]What do you mean, we?
[149:34.13]I practiced yesterday so I could understand how to play the game.
[149:36.90]I got familiar with it.
[149:38.84]I thought you meant somebody in chat told you to do that.
[149:42.16]No, I flipped upside down, and then we spent an hour and a half trying to figure out how to do it again.
[149:47.00]Ah, okay.
[149:47.52]Alright.
[149:47.94]Alright.
[149:48.46]Alright, here you go.
[149:49.98]Here are your grades.
[149:51.04]You got a 95 for creativity.
[149:53.86]You got a 100 for complexity.
[149:56.46]You get a 100 for cleanliness.
[149:58.16]This is a very good grade.
[150:00.42]Your philosophy is a 93.
[150:02.60]The only thing that I'm going to do here is I'm going to bring it down to a 90, and I'll tell you one reason why.
[150:07.25]Mm-hmm.
[150:09.28]The whole house was built around going upside down.
[150:12.54]Everything.
[150:13.72]And there's no second floor.
[150:15.66]And there's no basement.
[150:17.59]And the garage is empty.
[150:19.53]That's fair.
[150:19.95]But I thought that having quality individual rooms would make up for, instead of having like a bunch of things scattered around, you know, I went through quality over quantity.
[150:30.01]You did, which is why you still get an A. And you know what, I'm making a 92.
[150:35.75]So chat gave you an A, which is a 95.
[150:38.45]Nobody can get a 100.
[150:39.05]Can I guarantee you that this is the cleanest yard you'll see today?
[150:43.79]That's a huge deal, dude.
[150:44.90]Because seriously, like having a fully clean yard with grass planted.
[150:51.04]Big deal.
[150:52.22]This took almost one third of the total time.
[150:54.62]Yeah.
[150:55.38]Your total final grade.
[150:57.06]Congratulations, Etalyx.
[150:58.06]You are currently the head of the class with a 96.5.
[151:04.78]I'll take it.
[151:05.28]I appreciate it.
[151:07.08]96.5 for Etalyx.
[151:08.94]It was a hell of a job.
[151:10.90]And nobody wins.
[151:11.52]Did chat already vote?
[151:12.90]Chat did.
[151:13.20]They gave you an A. Oh, wow.
[151:15.06]So you're at 96.5.
[151:17.62]Well, yeah.
[151:18.14]I rounded it up.
[151:18.68]By the way, now that I've gotten scored, I can share my secret.
[151:21.76]Yeah?
[151:22.94]If you have cheats enabled and you type, you don't even have to open a window.
[151:26.98]You can just type it into the game.
[151:28.76]G-R-A-V.
[151:30.84]That's how you flip it.
[151:32.66]That's the graph cheat that we discovered.
[151:35.84]Before you go, real quick, can you just give the philosophy on what is going on with the red and the kind of metal here?
[151:40.95]Because that's one thing that I'm kind of reconsidering.
[151:44.93]Well, we were going for something that had kind of a classic vibe, but you'll notice that it does match the interior a little bit.
[151:51.59]Like we have this wallpaper here with the skulls, like the Day of the Dead type of skulls.
[151:57.60]Everybody's calling you a cheater.
[151:59.68]Yeah, that didn't work.
[152:03.41]We're all cheaters.
[152:04.23]We all unlocked all the tools.
[152:07.19]Hey, I didn't say you couldn't... That was the premise of the game.
[152:09.67]I didn't say you couldn't do these things.
[152:12.97]If anything, he spent the extra time to figure that out.
[152:16.86]So, that's the grade.
[152:18.10]You got a 96.5.
[152:18.46]I'm just a magician sharing my secrets so other people can enjoy.
[152:24.28]Alright.
[152:26.40]Instead of keeping it to myself arbitrarily.
[152:29.44]It's true.
[152:30.89]alright we're ready for the next person coming up next who is whose house is next I believe it is Vinny Vinny I believe you are I believe you are next thank you Etalyx congratulations for being ahead of the class so far I appreciate it great job Etalyx yeah hell yeah do we do we want to get some some uh anybody else want to say anything I mean we could we could do that too I mean I don't know I want to make it extend for too long but what does the class think
[152:56.94]There was no maze.
[152:58.72]I thought that was part of the criteria.
[152:59.82]I don't know.
[153:01.14]By the way, it's no maze.
[153:02.45]I think he's really flipped the house.
[153:06.89]I think cheating is not fair.
[153:10.37]I'm ready.
[153:10.73]Thanks for saying something, Poke.
[153:14.13]It's ironic coming from the person who got like 30 extra minutes to build compared to the rest.
[153:17.96]I used only 20 of those.
[153:20.38]A genuinely 20 of those.
[153:23.12]I was at the aquarium.
[153:24.32]He was at the aquarium, everybody.
[153:25.70]Alright.
[153:25.94]It's alright.
[153:26.46]We gave him the time.
[153:28.36]I do absolutely love Vitalik's home, but he is missing a complete second story.
[153:33.08]There's nothing there.
[153:35.31]Well, but hold on.
[153:36.29]I'll be sticking around for it.
[153:37.51]I'm not next.
[153:38.31]I'm not next.
[153:39.13]I love it, though.
[153:39.77]Hold on.
[153:41.01]But remember, we're talking about creativity is 35% of your total grade.
[153:45.57]I mean, flipping the house halfway through and doing a big fucking reveal.
[153:49.65]That was a holy... My expectations were not going there.
[153:53.10]I gasped, you know.
[153:54.28]I actually gasped.
[153:55.10]That was amazing.
[153:56.40]No mace.
[153:57.34]Yeah, I just waited for the mace.
[154:00.03]That was the prestige.
[154:01.31]But it was incredible.
[154:02.25]I loved it.
[154:03.47]The opportunity.
[154:04.73]Oh, the bathroom is not upside down.
[154:08.72]I caught that too, but I didn't say anything.
[154:10.50]The science isn't there.
[154:12.10]The science isn't there for the plumbing.
[154:14.20]They won't let you put pipes upside down.
[154:15.78]So I figured something was better than another.
[154:19.52]I tried to put something in the room.
[154:21.05]I love how somebody said House Flipper drama is insane.
[154:24.97]It is House Flipper drama.
[154:27.49]House Flipper drama is insane.
[154:30.17]House Flipper community is going to be in shambles after tonight.
[154:33.17]Hey, well, guess what?
[154:33.77]This is the House Flipper community.
[154:35.14]We're literally all here now.
[154:37.36]Okay.
[154:39.64]Alright, let's get Vinny in here.
[154:41.26]So, Etalyx, thank you.
[154:42.74]Thank you once again.
[154:44.02]Thank you, thank you.
[154:44.70]I appreciate it.
[154:45.53]Chat, thanks for the A. You're a real one.
[154:48.93]Thanks, Etalyx.
[154:50.20]Uh so if Vinny, same deal.
[154:51.00]I'm live Jerm.
[154:51.70]If you uh- yeah make sure Etalyx that you turn your stream off before I open this one.
[154:55.70]And then Vinny did you do the um- you know- I don't think you- because obviously I don't think if you were in the United States I don't think we have to do the thingy.
[155:03.70]Let me know how this looks. I'm going to just look around and tell me if this is- it's 30 FPS but it should be kind of smooth.
[155:09.00]Looks good.
[155:10.00]Alright.
[155:11.00]Alright I- I am ready for you to begin, I'm going to take your grades. Let me just change this real quick because these are not your grades these are Etalyx's grades.
[155:18.70]Okay.
[155:20.32]I will tell you when we are ready to get the tour.
[155:23.66]Sure.
[155:23.88]Okay.
[155:27.18]Vinny, please begin.
[155:28.84]Sure.
[155:29.06]Well, first of all, Jerma, thank you so much for having me.
[155:31.92]It's really just a pleasure to be here.
[155:34.48]I would like to emphasize that I did not cheat while making my House Flipper house.
[155:39.26]Okay.
[155:40.08]And so what you'll be seeing today is legitimate
[155:45.68]Now, the yard isn't really... Am I getting sub-tweeted right now?
[155:48.48]I think we lost some quality.
[155:50.50]Oh, really?
[155:52.78]It looked good for the first five seconds.
[155:54.26]Are you 130 FPS?
[155:56.16]Yeah.
[155:57.06]Are you?
[155:57.28]It looks like you're at 60.
[155:59.36]Let me try taking a quick look here.
[156:03.31]It says 30.
[156:03.99]Yeah.
[156:05.43]Want me to go down to 720p or try 60?
[156:06.37]Dude, take it down to 720.
[156:15.60]I think the better reading mode worked really well.
[156:18.00]Yeah.
[156:18.80]How do you do that?
[156:21.70]I think if there's a box, it's like, see to show text better.
[156:24.68]It's like a checkbox you can do.
[156:28.56]Yeah, I don't see that.
[156:31.24]Where was that?
[156:32.02]It should be on the drop down.
[156:34.24]See how this is.
[156:38.30]Oh, that's better.
[156:39.34]That's better.
[156:39.72]How we feel on this?
[156:42.45]This looks a little better.
[156:45.35]Yeah, I think this is good.
[156:46.03]Yeah, I don't see it.
[156:46.87]It's weird.
[156:47.23]I don't see it in the drop down at all, actually.
[156:49.79]Very strange.
[156:50.67]I think this is good.
[156:51.33]I think this is clear enough, I think.
[156:53.80]Okay.
[156:55.08]Alrighty.
[156:55.82]Well, anyway, like I said, so yeah, the yard is your basic yard.
[156:59.30]It's just kind of, you know, natural.
[157:01.12]It's just I left it natural.
[157:02.32]I gave a little koi pond.
[157:04.00]Okay.
[157:04.52]Nothing special in there.
[157:05.72]Still nice.
[157:07.34]I can tell you the feature of the house is, you know, we got some nice paint.
[157:13.03]Let me take you inside.
[157:15.91]So as you can see here, I've got furniture.
[157:19.05]You do have furniture.
[157:20.83]I've got a picture of my family.
[157:23.83]I've got my favorite ducks from Animal Crossing.
[157:27.37]So you see it's like a proper home.
[157:31.22]There's Simon Cowell and Howard the Duck.
[157:35.24]So lots of important people in my life.
[157:37.62]Okay, so this is more of a personal touch.
[157:42.04]It is.
[157:42.48]It's rustic.
[157:43.34]I'm going for the rustic feel.
[157:45.42]And you can see we even got a nice accent wall.
[157:48.62]We don't go in this room.
[157:50.46]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[157:51.44]What do you mean?
[157:54.02]Go back?
[157:54.36]We don't go in this room.
[157:55.24]What do you mean?
[157:57.63]It's just, it's not a room I would recommend going in.
[158:00.05]Open that door.
[158:03.03]Open that door.
[158:03.89]I need to see the whole house.
[158:12.15]Okay, leave and close the door.
[158:14.01]Don't show me that again.
[158:16.09]So in here we have the hybrid kitchen and bathroom.
[158:21.15]Okay.
[158:21.77]So there's a shower.
[158:23.49]So there's a nice carpet here for the bathroom kitchen.
[158:29.63]You've got a nice toilet.
[158:32.39]You got an iPad right next to the toilet.
[158:34.99]Good.
[158:35.17]Because you may need that.
[158:36.35]I use it a lot.
[158:38.13]Put that on the dishwasher right there.
[158:40.97]Got some cabinets, um, urinal.
[158:43.43]So when you're cooking and you know, you're, you're busy on the stove here, you can take a quick piss, use your soap and go back to cooking.
[158:52.91]And the carpet is just a really nice feature because it just makes it comfortable.
[158:57.29]Cause when you're, when you're cooking, you're in a kitchen, um, you're moving around a lot.
[159:02.55]So the carpet really takes some of the, some of the wear.
[159:07.65]off of that equation.
[159:08.94]I do appreciate the throw-up fucking color that you have for the carpet.
[159:12.80]That's very nice.
[159:14.18]It hides all the potential kitchen mess.
[159:17.76]So, you know, if you still shit on the ground, that's fine.
[159:20.26]And piss stains and the like.
[159:22.87]So, yeah, really, I think it's just a nice thing, and it's really an underutilized concept, the kitchenette-bathroom combo.
[159:29.97]And also, the Gray Leno show is the greatest late-night show of all time.
[159:34.40]So then...
[159:36.15]as you know.
[159:36.55]So I'll show you the upstairs real quick.
[159:38.67]So, you know, I didn't quite... Go back.
[159:41.35]How many times have we seen this image already?
[159:43.71]Haven't we?
[159:45.11]Which one?
[159:45.65]That one.
[159:46.27]No, that's just like a type of image.
[159:48.13]No, the one on the left.
[159:51.45]Oh, that's just me.
[159:53.28]Like, put through a filter a couple times.
[159:55.50]I just thought it would be nice to have that there.
[159:57.14]Connor, you're watching right now, right?
[159:59.54]There's a version of my face that has this same face.
[160:05.38]On his Japanese Google?
[160:06.88]Yeah, not on Japanese Google.
[160:08.66]Sorry.
[160:09.20]Oh, okay.
[160:10.10]Okay, alright.
[160:13.10]I do like the... I love, before you say anything, I love the wallpaper.
[160:17.72]I think it's very fun.
[160:18.49]Oh, thanks.
[160:21.61]That's cool.
[160:22.77]Yeah, there's definitely a nice vibe to the room.
[160:26.01]I tried to find sand flooring, but I like this better.
[160:29.35]I have some photos.
[160:30.37]I was going to do a little photo gallery of the evolution of our image together.
[160:35.33]from PAX, like, six years ago, five years ago, to the most recent thing, because we're buddies.
[160:41.72]You know, me, you, and Kryken, we're good buddies.
[160:43.62]Yeah.
[160:45.82]And so, anyway, this is my alien, Nortz, and he's smiling.
[160:50.76]Here's the gamer chair, the desk.
[160:54.89]Back to the gamer chair, there's a gun next to the gamer chair.
[160:58.51]I'm just asking a question about it.
[161:01.87]What do you want to know about it?
[161:03.05]Why is there a gun next to the gamer chair?
[161:06.11]Why isn't there a gun next to the gamer chair?
[161:08.99]Okay, fair.
[161:11.27]Fair, okay, okay, fair.
[161:13.89]Um, here's the bed.
[161:16.23]And, uh... Why's there mirrors?
[161:17.95]Surrounding... Surrounding mirrors.
[161:21.95]Well, this is... I mean, this is the implication.
[161:25.39]Really, more than anything.
[161:26.65]Are you a vampire?
[161:30.03]I mean, some would say a sex vampire.
[161:31.96]Wait, who can't see their... Vampires can't see their reflection or something?
[161:35.34]Why would you have mirrors everywhere?
[161:38.62]Um, there's... Wait a second.
[161:41.76]Wait a second.
[161:43.48]This is clicking right now.
[161:44.82]This is clicking right now.
[161:46.98]Cool.
[161:48.02]But what do you think it is?
[161:49.72]Are you...
[161:52.40]Are these all here for you to place?
[161:53.82]So anyway, down this way, I'll show you another cool feature of the house.
[162:00.02]So, you know, there's toilets pretty much in every main room.
[162:04.34]But then here we have probably, I don't know, the Grimace room, you could call it.
[162:10.37]There was an accident.
[162:12.45]Something happened here.
[162:14.47]But there is a toilet.
[162:16.71]And...
[162:18.37]we'll go back to the wall go back to the wall that that is that that's Mr. is that Mr. dink yeah well he's purple and I feel like him and grimace probably had
[162:31.46]like something to do with each other.
[162:32.86]I don't know what, but I'm trying to find out the connection.
[162:36.57]Vinny, I want to interject for a second here.
[162:38.59]I do have to drop a couple points on philosophy and creativity because I'm seeing a theme that, did you paint the outside of the house purple because this Grimace room existed?
[162:47.08]And that was the first thing you did.
[162:48.66]And then you said, shit, I can't just make a Grimace house.
[162:53.14]no I started with the grimace room yeah that's right yeah I knew the grimace room would have to be okay like really important to the room and uh we got the summoning circle here well it's more of a summoning cube but it worked and so yeah I mean that's pretty much it I don't have anything of note to show you back here because I spent a lot of time trying to get can you go to the garage all rustic and nice there's nothing in there but can you go to the left of the garage
[163:26.25]Oh Vinny.
[163:28.31]Oh Vinny.
[163:29.83]Vinny.
[163:33.15]Oh Vinny.
[163:33.75]It's dirty back there.
[163:35.75]It's pretty dirty back there.
[163:38.35]Hey Jerma, can you take a look on Japanese Google real quick and check for a photo of you, if you wouldn't mind?
[163:49.49]Anyway, so yeah, the Mr. Dink connection is really, ooh, really interesting, isn't it?
[163:55.62]That connection.
[163:56.48]I actually do like the Mr. Dink.
[163:58.22]Oh, I forgot to play the dramatic sound from Hell's Kitchen.
[164:00.74]Hold on.
[164:03.24]Oh, this, you've got lots of dirt back there.
[164:05.10]I thought that was the YouTube video that I just opened.
[164:17.24]okay that was that was I'm I'm really happy that you're here in my house I thought that was a different youtube video I just tried to play the okay alright here we go Vinny
[164:27.08]Good shit.
[164:28.10]I liked your philosophy.
[164:29.24]I thought your creativity was great.
[164:30.82]I love the fact that you have your multi kitchen bathroom area.
[164:34.80]Fantastic.
[164:35.36]I'm going to give you an extra point in philosophy on that one.
[164:38.38]Your cleanliness could be a little bit higher.
[164:40.24]I'll give you a 90 because it was just that one area.
[164:42.02]But I mean, actually, never mind.
[164:44.30]You shouldn't have shown me that room more than once because I forgot it existed in this blood all over the walls.
[164:48.43]You got to see in cleanliness.
[164:50.39]Alright.
[164:50.67]So here you go.
[164:51.75]Chat.
[164:53.01]What are you going to give Vinny's house?
[164:55.79]A, B, C, or D?
[164:58.58]Because right now, Vinny, you're looking at a... Somewhere around a B, it seems like.
[165:03.68]No, no, no.
[165:04.40]Hang on.
[165:05.00]Here.
[165:05.20]I was doing this earlier.
[165:06.20]I'm going to play an A chord.
[165:10.50]Oh, it's a little out of tune.
[165:11.40]But don't worry.
[165:11.78]I promise you that was an A chord.
[165:13.86]Wait, before you do this, go to your volume and turn the music volume down.
[165:18.12]Nah, it's okay.
[165:20.70]I like the blood room.
[165:21.66]No.
[165:22.12]No, you're good.
[165:24.50]You can disagree.
[165:25.00]Alright.
[165:27.96]Alright, what do we got for a chat grade?
[165:32.34]Ooh, they're being pretty nice to you.
[165:35.96]Thank you, chat.
[165:37.38]That's really kind of you.
[165:40.34]Listen, I'll take a B. That doesn't matter.
[165:42.79]But I'm just happy that I have a house that has furniture in it that isn't, you know...
[165:49.19]upside down.
[165:50.31]Because listen, I wouldn't want to live like that.
[165:52.03]Would you?
[165:53.03]I don't know.
[165:54.67]And I'm really happy that I can sit on my couch and chill and watch a little tiny TV over there.
[165:59.36]And then if I need to go to the bathroom, I got my iPad here.
[166:03.38]And then I can also cook while I'm in the bathroom.
[166:05.86]It's really, really nice.
[166:06.86]Saves a lot of time.
[166:07.77]The iPad gave you extra points, by the way.
[166:09.59]Be curious.
[166:10.99]Thank you.
[166:13.09]Alright, what do we got?
[166:14.21]We are at... You are getting... The vote is pretty much locked in at this point, although a lot of people want to give you an A, but it seems like the class is going to give you a B. So... Um... Vinny?
[166:26.02]Vinny, I think you might be pleasantly surprised by this grid.
[166:43.06]You got an 83.8.
[166:44.80]I'll take it.
[166:49.00]You got a solid B. That's a solid B. Yeah, I'll take it.
[166:54.12]Very nice.
[166:54.82]Very clean.
[166:55.36]I like the philosophy.
[166:56.18]Thanks.
[166:57.92]Excellent, excellent, excellent.
[167:00.44]If you could hit escape and go to your options and turn the volume down on your music.
[167:04.40]Yep, sure.
[167:08.77]Turn it down.
[167:09.90]oh there you go alright yeah uh can we get uh anybody anybody have anything to say yep I think you got robbed I think that was easily an a house I agree I loved it I quite appreciate the crime scene and all the blood on the walls thank you like you know it really adds something unexpected in your home you know Jerma if we have a private room do you is it really your right to barge in there and start looking around
[167:33.52]Oh, shit.
[167:34.28]That's a good point.
[167:35.43]Yeah.
[167:35.91]That's a little rude.
[167:38.45]If we have a private room.
[167:41.65]He didn't want that to be seen.
[167:42.83]I'll come in and do like a New York City box apartment.
[167:48.42]Where was the maze, actually?
[167:50.90]I'm sorry to say there was no maze.
[167:52.40]I enjoyed the maze.
[167:53.30]Yeah, no maze.
[167:54.44]Yeah.
[167:56.86]Who do we got next?
[167:59.91]I also added an image of Japanese Google just in case you were confused.
[168:03.21]In the chat, you can see it.
[168:06.26]Cool.
[168:08.02]Alright, so we got, who's up next?
[168:09.16]We got, uh, yeah, thanks Vinny.
[168:10.79]It was an awesome job.
[168:12.79]Thanks for coming out.
[168:13.27]I'm gonna get going too, so have a good one everybody.
[168:14.93]Good luck, good luck, bye.
[168:16.11]Thanks Vinny.
[168:16.69]Take care.
[168:17.75]Later.
[168:18.61]Vinny's a good lad.
[168:19.83]Alright.
[168:20.71]Who's up next?
[168:21.19]I think it's either Poke or Ludwig, right?
[168:22.73]Who's, uh, any of you two need to dip?
[168:24.73]You wanna get, uh, get it over with, or?
[168:26.13]I think it was me.
[168:28.59]I'm ready.
[168:29.81]Oh, no, no, yeah, Criken, it is you, because you do have to dip.
[168:32.35]Yeah, Criken has to dip, so...
[168:39.11]Why can I still hear this music?
[168:42.89]Is this from my camera?
[168:47.79]Oh, it's Vinny.
[168:48.35]Oh, Vinny's still live.
[168:49.92]He's, like, still doing it.
[168:50.98]So we're gonna tell Vinny to, uh... Alright, let's tell Vinny that he has to stop screen sharing.
[169:02.64]Okay, there we go.
[169:04.00]Alright, Criken, are you ready?
[169:05.98]Yep.
[169:07.09]Let's just do a quick little move-around test.
[169:08.76]I think it looks alright.
[169:13.75]Okay.
[169:14.61]We are ready for Kryken's house.
[169:18.11]yeah take it away Criken welcome everyone um yeah this is my house uh yeah first first time in in this game uh so you know learned a lot on the fly and I know the first thing you're thinking is yeah you know compared to some of the other uh yards this seems like it's a little bit this is kind of dirty Criken this is very dirty and you'd be right but also what would if I told you it was intentional and that some of this trash was left here with a very uh important message
[169:48.47]OK, well, I'm going to have to honestly, I'm going to have to start you out at like a 60 for cleanliness just because of what we know so far.
[169:53.86]But I'm willing to change it.
[169:55.80]And that's that's all I'm looking to hear.
[169:58.11]Alright.
[169:58.37]Just, you know, open mind.
[169:59.73]And that's that what you see here.
[170:03.03]huh a fallout shelter are you saying that uh maybe something like the this world that we're in is kind of a post-apocalyptic one perchance and maybe there's like some some mess out here left from you know the the fucking fall of humanity maybe have we thought about that I I have thought about it I'm also thinking about potentially you forgetting how much time is left and just going oh shit there's a lot of trash outside I have to pretend I have to come up with a story
[170:30.86]Or maybe this was the point all along.
[170:33.18]And let me welcome you inside to are you familiar, by the way, with the the whole, you know, Barbie movie Oppenheimer kind of, you know, double feature thing that's been going on there and it very topical.
[170:45.15]Everyone's all looking forward to it.
[170:47.65]I know that the Barbie movie is coming out.
[170:50.47]And the Oppenheimer movie is coming out the same day.
[170:54.71]Oh, it's coming out the same day.
[170:55.76]Alright.
[170:56.06]Okay.
[170:56.30]I get it.
[170:56.60]I get it.
[170:56.90]I get it.
[170:57.16]That's the whole thing.
[170:58.86]So I thought, what if we made a Fallout shelter, right?
[171:02.72]Because Oppenheimer.
[171:03.96]That was themed after Barbie.
[171:06.11]Barbie.
[171:09.15]oh okay yeah let it go alright we're still percolating here so welcome on in this is the first room we have uh and you'll see that there's each room uh in this house is themed after a different uh just kind of fun concept right something that that I think Barbie would enjoy or you would want in a fallout shelter should the oppenheimer uh bombs
[171:35.09]fall you know at any minute so this is the first one any questions feel free to ask I have one question and it is did you and Vinny use the same wallpaper uh I don't think he used this one did he I I will say there's a good chance I think this wallpaper yes no we did use the same you'll notice there's more than one wallpaper in this house and that's because like I mentioned
[171:58.57]each room is a different theme and so this is the neon room okay uh we have a little TV here like you know uh TV Mike from willy wonka what happened here and hop over this uh what happened here well this is the fish room as you can see um so we have a little uh fish here in the corner and that's it uh now we can move on to this is the love room this is the love room
[172:21.25]yes yeah uh we got fairy lights we got some chocolate and is there a reason why the chocolate and the lights are not on a on a structure of any kind like on a table yeah we only had one of those and that's for the fish okay there turns out it takes a lot of time to keep adding
[172:44.48]you know furniture and it's better to focus in my mind on the the philosophy and the spirit of a room than on the actual uh you know amenities I can do something real quick for me right now just very quickly yeah take out your mop oh um and mop the floor for a second
[173:09.84]That's the floor, baby.
[173:10.68]That's just what it looks like, guys.
[173:12.51]Yeah, this was by design.
[173:13.78]Okay.
[173:17.63]I appreciate you checking, though.
[173:18.79]Alright.
[173:19.29]Lovely floor was not dirty.
[173:21.33]Definitely continue.
[173:23.59]Didn't hurt.
[173:24.41]OK, well, speaking of amenities, this is the snow room.
[173:28.34]We have a friend and snow is cold.
[173:32.22]So we have a, you know, a fridge, which is also used in fallout shelters to escape bombs like in Indiana Jones.
[173:38.69]So I love it.
[173:40.45]I love the snow room.
[173:41.94]great uh moving on we have uh this is the neon room and over here in the corner we have my little rat rat friends uh they have their water bowl and a nice little uh bed of course we keep oh cool we don't want them to get out and make a mess so we take them out one at a time something happened with the wallpaper back there there's some wallpaper issues I see
[174:08.35]There's also some structural complexity issues, I think, that are maybe bringing a little bit of points down.
[174:16.20]Go back in this room and look to the right.
[174:18.86]Oh, you mean... Yeah, I'm seeing a little bit of a... Snow tends to blow, right?
[174:24.59]And so I just thought it'd be kind of fun to show that it gets around the house sometimes, you know, in the right mood.
[174:30.35]Speaking of, look.
[174:31.49]Uh, we can fill the rat's cage with food.
[174:34.69]That's a cute thing, right?
[174:35.97]Look at that.
[174:36.57]Honestly, first person to incorporate an animal, like an animal enclosure.
[174:41.32]We've seen a couple rats, but we have not seen an actual animal enclosure yet.
[174:44.44]So, I'm going to have to give you some points for that.
[174:47.16]Comfortable space.
[174:48.57]Um, moving on.
[174:51.23]Uh, we have, now we're entering the dog room.
[174:55.60]uh good dog can I stop you for one second yep you started this with a philosophy of 95 because you told me at the entrance that this was a Barbie oppenheimer house did that change in your process give me your philosophy on this like did that change when halfway through may I counter you with this does Barbie not have a dog I don't know does Barbie have a dog
[175:17.85]I don't know either, but probably right.
[175:19.87]So, uh, this is the good dog room.
[175:22.43]Um, I'm, I was thinking of all the fun things that Barbie would like to have in, in her playhouse, you know?
[175:28.27]And so I couldn't find many props related to dogs.
[175:30.99]So I do have a nice dog light down here, but, um, that's all we got.
[175:35.11]So over here, every good house needs a toilet.
[175:40.02]Um, and this is an outhouse that you put behind this.
[175:44.09]Yeah, well, we didn't have plumbing working, so I did have to just kind of drill a hole in the wall and throw the outhouse outside.
[175:50.67]We also have the piss buckets for the overflow.
[175:53.00]Oh, those are P. You're not getting higher than a 60 in cleanliness.
[175:55.66]This is not happening.
[175:56.32]I'm sorry, Criken.
[175:56.82]It's not possible.
[175:57.18]We have buckets for them.
[175:58.12]They're not on the ground.
[175:59.48]Like, I can show you the broom thing again if you want to confirm, but they aren't, you know.
[176:03.56]I'm going to give you some points in creativity because that's actually funny, but you're not getting higher than a 60 in cleanliness.
[176:10.76]It's just impossible.
[176:11.91]Just wait till you see the rest of the place, and I think maybe you'll be changing your tune.
[176:15.51]Okay.
[176:16.07]Speaking of cleanliness, this is the plant room.
[176:19.43]I know you said that you were excited that there was a garden from one of the earlier contestants, and I thought, what about if the garden was inside?
[176:26.75]And also, in case the zombies come, this is, again, a Fallout shelter at the end of the day, and so we have an ammo box and machine gun just for guarding the place.
[176:37.26]You know what I think would really help stop an intrusion by zombies?
[176:41.56]Is having full walls.
[176:44.14]I think that would help.
[176:45.92]With maybe a weapon aiming from a different floor.
[176:49.81]So I'm going to have to give you a little bit of a doc on that.
[176:52.47]Now what if I threw this out there?
[176:55.05]Plants vs. Zombies.
[177:02.18]I gave you a point in philosophy for that.
[177:03.66]Alright, great.
[177:04.46]Um, and then moving on, this is the Mexico room.
[177:06.86]Uh, we have, uh, kind of the, you know,
[177:09.88]Day of the Dead theme.
[177:11.57]Cool.
[177:12.59]With this Garland and little skull.
[177:15.45]And then over here, a full-on spooky guy.
[177:19.77]So, you know, I just really want to make sure that each room here felt like its own world.
[177:24.43]Its own world.
[177:25.61]Just like the Barbie in the Oppenheimer movie.
[177:28.83]Right?
[177:29.27]Yeah.
[177:29.61]You can see my vision.
[177:30.61]Yeah.
[177:31.73]Then I got back on track with the theme of the Oppenheimer thing with, like, kind of a...
[177:37.83]Like a generator, gas generator, right?
[177:40.79]Some boots, which you would probably need in the wasteland.
[177:44.06]Moving on, we have a cute cat portrait that I found on the shop and just couldn't help but put in my building.
[177:52.08]It's very cute.
[177:53.82]This is the brooding corner.
[177:55.48]What's everybody with the guns?
[177:58.10]Everybody has like a gun with a chair.
[178:00.92]Well, you naturally hang your gun up when you... you know are like kicking back and just reminds you of your own mortality.
[178:08.44]Like Oppenheimer does, uh that movie I believe is going to be a bit dark so I thought a nice little breeding corner be good this little spider over there though to keep it keep it light.
[178:15.44]Um and then this of course is bringing us to uh the end of the tour um, which by the way I don't know if you noticed this was a maze the whole time.
[178:26.44]I was gonna say: Where are the doors?
[178:27.44]Somebody said does Barbie not have doors?
[178:30.00]The doors uh were made-
[178:35.03]Because as I mentioned, someone, me, this is their first experience with this game and first built the walls and then later didn't realize the doors were a thing until after, you know, using the sledgehammer tool.
[178:48.24]But I think it adds to kind of the rustic feel of, you know, finding your way through a maze, right?
[178:54.70]You sort of did the reverse of, oh my God, mom and dad are coming home.
[178:58.30]We have to clean up the place.
[179:00.36]So you kind of did like, oh my God, mom and dad are coming home.
[179:03.07]We have to build a fucking house.
[179:05.72]Yeah.
[179:06.02]And that's how this is what you could come up with.
[179:08.24]That's kind of that's pretty accurate.
[179:10.42]I also think, though, there's some cool parallel, you know, comparison of the rats, right?
[179:14.52]Rats in a maze.
[179:15.76]And then here we are in a maze.
[179:18.38]And so that's probably worth a couple of points, you know?
[179:20.88]Hey, is this 90s themed?
[179:21.52]Is this 90s themed?
[179:22.00]Is this 90s themed?
[179:22.58]This this room.
[179:23.28]Yes.
[179:23.40]This room.
[179:23.80]Yes.
[179:23.88]This room.
[179:35.72]Yes.
[179:37.72]This room is kind of timeless, I think, though.
[179:39.70]So, you know, take that as you will.
[179:41.56]Alright.
[179:41.98]Finally, though, we got to go to the upstairs because I want to see upstairs.
[179:47.07]Well, feast your eyes on the point of this whole maze.
[179:54.83]about good vibes over here and so what is better than good vibes especially at the end of the world at the the apocalypse of time uh we know toilet paper is going to be the most valuable thing so I just wanted to kind of uh pay homage to that and have kind of a nice you know denouement if you will kind of wrapping everything up here as you come to the top you did get a point in cleanliness because of the toilet paper there so there's one point in cleanliness you got a 61.
[180:22.59]61 great well I'll take that um alright can you look at the ceiling okay look down okay I just was seeing what was on the ground if you had any it was is this default uh the default floor on the ground
[180:40.34]Well, I think since I went through a lot of effort putting up wallpaper on literally every other wall, I really, I kind of thought the ending being a more minimal kind of, you know, good vibe room.
[180:55.01]Okay.
[180:56.05]Would just kind of tie the whole thing together and, you know, I didn't want to overdo it.
[181:01.32]Can we get chat?
[181:02.00]Can we get chat to give a grade of this house?
[181:03.36]What do you guys think?
[181:04.34]A, B, C, D?
[181:05.88]We don't give Fs here.
[181:08.32]Alright, Criken, I can tell you what I got over here so far.
[181:10.94]I got you at an 80.
[181:12.04]I got you an 85 for creativity because you really pulled me in with the whole Oppenheimer Barbie house.
[181:16.91]Yeah.
[181:17.43]And I dropped some scores elsewhere because it turned out that that was just a bait and switch.
[181:22.07]And you grabbed us.
[181:24.33]And unfortunately, if your whole house had been a Barbie house, it probably would have been a lot higher.
[181:29.88]I'm just going to be completely honest with you.
[181:31.50]Although...
[181:32.64]the philosophy of you making individual rooms and individual spaces that were completely disconnected from each other did have to take you some time and you stuck with that philosophy so I'm gonna you got an 87 for philosophy wow thank you you got 76 for complexity and 61 for cleanliness and chat has given you they're still deciding but it looks like they're going to give you a c oh alright well
[182:00.70]question where is the rest of the upstairs oh wait wait yeah where is the rest of the upstairs so rather than leaving a empty uh room right that kind of uh felt unfinished I opted for let's just kind of box it in um what does the outside look like can you go out to the outside and look at the exterior
[182:31.73]Chat, you get 75 from chat.
[182:34.35]Your total grade... Ooh!
[182:38.50]Actually... Alright.
[182:43.50]You got a 78.4.
[182:44.78]That's a C+.
[182:45.04]Hey!
[182:47.52]Almost a B. Alright.
[182:49.60]I'll take it.
[182:50.82]I will say you hit the nail on the head with the Oppenheimer Barbie house...
[182:59.03]kind of being abandoned halfway through for the multiple room thing.
[183:02.01]That's exactly what happened.
[183:03.15]That's what I figured.
[183:03.71]Um, I started with that vision and I thought, oh, this is going to be great.
[183:07.03]And then, uh, kind of got carried away, I believe with each of these rooms.
[183:10.49]So, uh, you know, you hit the nail on the head there.
[183:12.86]And I think if I could go back, I would've just done the first thing.
[183:16.40]philosophy what you being at an 87 for philosophy uh you yeah you were on the right track it's just timing and first time playing it I completely get it that's a good job it was very wonderful presentation very wonderful house everybody should be clapping right now please thank you Criken thank you yeah this has been a pleasure anybody have anything to say about Criken's um a themed house that became unthemed after 20 minutes
[183:42.82]Yeah, I got a lot to say.
[183:44.76]A lot to say?
[183:45.73]You got a lot to say.
[183:48.77]First of all, fantastic job on the maze incorporation.
[183:51.42]Thank you, thank you for having me.
[183:55.17]I, why, when Jerma, when you knocked down the wall, Jerma said, whoa, at an empty room.
[184:00.93]I just, what the fuck was that?
[184:03.44]You just said, whoa, at an empty room.
[184:06.06]What was that?
[184:07.34]Well, I, cause I didn't know the empty room.
[184:10.02]It was very strange that he was able to hide this from me so well.
[184:13.84]actually he tried strange and he built a wall oh we got maze drama he hit it from me he hit it from me all the all the masers youtube you guys look it was not empty there actually was another toilet paper behind the wall in case you lose the first one there's a second in my comments I apologize additional toilet paper yeah
[184:35.67]It was an Easter egg, yeah.
[184:37.85]Your outside is very dirty.
[184:39.43]Your outside is very dirty.
[184:42.25]Out of everybody, I know it's part of the theme, but you have the worst outside, I would say.
[184:45.64]And I mean that in the nicest way possible.
[184:48.26]Open the garage, please.
[184:49.66]There's no nice way to say that.
[184:50.98]I did clean this side, though.
[184:52.64]Look, Vinny, okay?
[184:54.94]Oh, shit, you did clean that side.
[184:56.99]I don't know why I specifically cleaned that corner, but I did.
[185:01.06]What's in the garage?
[185:01.84]It was a very enticing corner to clean.
[185:03.68]I agree.
[185:04.44]I will.
[185:04.68]Like everyone else.
[185:05.76]Joel.
[185:06.76]Joel is the only one really that actually utilized the garage.
[185:10.98]That's true.
[185:11.62]This is true.
[185:13.00]Joel is sitting at an 87 right now.
[185:14.04]I didn't know there was a dog back here.
[185:18.36]Alright.
[185:18.76]Are we ready to move on?
[185:19.64]We have, I think it's, now it's either Polk or Ludwig.
[185:22.96]I think it's, who do we got?
[185:26.04]I'm ready.
[185:26.38]Polk is ready to go right now.
[185:28.22]And Ludwig will be right after Polk.
[185:32.27]Oh, how are you?
[185:33.85]Great.
[185:35.67]Okay, how are you?
[185:36.77]I'm doing fantastic.
[185:37.57]I'm so glad you're actually here.
[185:39.08]I'm, I'm so looking forward to your house.
[185:41.80]I'm really happy you actually got to be here for this.
[185:44.34]So I hope no, I really thought it was tomorrow.
[185:48.26]But no, this is great dates times.
[185:51.00]It's hard.
[185:51.36]It's easy to get it all messed up, right?
[185:55.22]I checked the time I didn't go over.
[185:57.10]I think I didn't.
[185:58.44]So we're good.
[185:59.08]Yeah, well, you had to get you we give you time anyways, because make it fair.
[186:01.97]yeah actually a little bit alright well Etalyx flipped his whole house upside down so it's okay alright so let's open up your stream let's make sure how to can you just move it around for a little bit so I can see it's a little bit ready to turn around I think it's okay I think it's alright yeah it should be good let's let's just double check it how do you guys feel I think it's that can you move give us like a full circle
[186:30.54]Yeah, we're good.
[186:31.10]Looks good.
[186:32.00]Alright.
[186:32.48]Alright, Poke.
[186:33.06]Take it away.
[186:35.61]What do you got?
[186:37.47]Hi, and welcome to my house.
[186:39.98]I, uh...
[186:45.98]this is my beautiful house I worked on um this is my first time playing too uh either you know I had no past experience uh on the way here I woke up my roommate he you know he won on my pc did everything for me the tutorial everything and I just took over and I I'm here's what I got okay so
[187:09.62]Let's take a look at the outside.
[187:11.10]The outside is a little dirty, Poke.
[187:14.12]It's a little dirty on the outside.
[187:15.36]I didn't really have time to clean the outside, you know?
[187:19.09]Okay, alright, okay.
[187:20.63]It's not about what is out anyways.
[187:23.17]It's about what is inside.
[187:25.25]I think that matters, you know?
[187:27.47]Can we start with the garage?
[187:30.38]Do we have to?
[187:31.30]Kinda, because I want to see if there's anything in it.
[187:41.14]you hear the sound by the way I hear the sound yeah okay alright so it's the cars can fit in here yeah you I mean it's it's good it's clean you can fit cars if you really wanted to you know so I went for like a lime green design
[188:03.26]you know and if people look at I mean since the since the house isn't really done fully you know what's wrong with having a few placeholders you know so is the are these other how is this what the house could look like eventually is what's on the exterior I don't know I mean they let those houses look great whatever houses these are they look phenomenal I mean it may
[188:29.03]It just messes with your imagination a little bit.
[188:30.67]It's like an optical illusion.
[188:33.17]So here's, let's just go in the front.
[188:35.59]This is the front of the house right here.
[188:37.27]This is the front door?
[188:39.39]Yep.
[188:41.15]You know, let's put some music on.
[188:43.07]So I went with like a, I went with like a, like a airport.
[188:54.61]You know what I'm saying?
[188:55.73]Alright.
[188:55.95]So you made an airport in, okay.
[188:57.75]Give me the philosophy on that.
[188:59.64]I mean, when you're rich, you can really do anything you really want.
[189:02.72]And this is for the people out there who just want to get what they want, you know?
[189:08.30]Some people want a Willy Wonka house.
[189:10.36]Some people want a factory.
[189:12.27]You know, some people really just want an airport.
[189:15.73]I would want an airport.
[189:16.69]Poe, can you elbow the CD player?
[189:18.13]I think there's something wrong with it.
[189:21.85]I think it's skipping a little.
[189:25.86]Okay.
[189:26.20]Now...
[189:27.85]this is we're all streamers here we're all streamers here and I made sure to make one of the houses really relatable to all of them this is the streamer room I now I didn't have any photos on my pc I only had sponsor photos so these are just these are the different sponsors you've had throughout the last year you have one of those banned lawn chairs
[189:58.75]The most uncomfortable.
[189:59.67]Those things make sweaty red fucking marks all over your whole body.
[190:02.99]I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to take some points off of that.
[190:05.91]Really?
[190:07.18]They make sweaty red bands across your whole body.
[190:09.30]It's horrible.
[190:12.40]But I'm gonna have to give you some points with complexity though.
[190:16.26]Your score is very high right now.
[190:18.22]There's a triple PC set.
[190:20.86]People have dual PC setups.
[190:22.29]In here, this house, we have the triple PC.
[190:25.25]So these are all three individual computers.
[190:27.98]Yes.
[190:28.62]Okay.
[190:29.70]Interesting.
[190:30.54]So... Do you... Can you pump through, like, multiple games?
[190:34.70]Are you trying to do multiple streams?
[190:36.56]It's to stream the streaming PC.
[190:38.67]Okay, what do we got on the walls here?
[190:39.59]These are TVs?
[190:41.07]These are all just TVs.
[190:43.35]Ah, cool.
[190:45.47]Now, here's the kitchen.
[190:52.81]Garage doors!
[190:54.90]Who are your doors?
[190:56.74]Yeah, I mean...
[190:58.46]We all learn from rust, you know, how to really protect yourself.
[191:03.41]And why would you not want, like, a, like, you know.
[191:08.97]Yeah, I, I, I, did you, where'd you get the flashlight from?
[191:14.95]It's, uh.
[191:16.63]It's music.
[191:17.38]Alright, wait, wait, turn, turn back around.
[191:22.40]I, what, what, this is just a picture of, who's that a picture of?
[191:27.27]Just some inspiration to get, like, just get back to work.
[191:30.35]Got it.
[191:30.55]You know what I mean?
[191:31.17]Got it.
[191:33.05]I do like the wallpaper in here.
[191:34.53]It's very creative.
[191:36.17]Thank you.
[191:40.15]So, can I see, what's the painting on the wall here?
[191:42.85]On this side wall?
[191:44.23]If you turn to the left.
[191:45.21]It's a window.
[191:46.08]Oh, that's a window.
[191:46.66]Oh, that would be a beautiful yard.
[191:48.58]Every house needs air.
[191:49.84]Well, turn around.
[191:50.48]Let me see the beautiful yard again.
[191:51.78]Turn around and look at the yard.
[191:54.52]Yeah, to the right.
[191:55.50]Where that is.
[191:58.00]yeah that look that's exactly what that looks like on the wall now go back go back inside and take a look out I just want to oh yeah you mean like here yeah it does it does yeah that's what it looks like it's uh transparent it's weird it's weird that the lake is um like kind of an optical illusion kind of like a mirage sometimes that's weird it looks good though let's go upstairs yeah let's take a look upstairs
[192:33.62]that we don't want to go down there what is going on down there alright this is uh the realtor's one of the realtor's son oh okay I like it I like it I do appreciate so the floor uh Vinny and Criken had this on their walls so it's really nice that you actually made them rugs on the ground yeah I think that's a pretty good philosophical reason to do that thank you
[193:03.06]I couldn't find any lights.
[193:05.56]Wait, that's a... That's what came up when I searched for lights, if you're wondering.
[193:11.87]These don't turn on either.
[193:12.69]Do you... Okay, Poke.
[193:20.01]Very important question.
[193:22.11]Do you have a bathroom?
[193:24.88]Yes.
[193:25.60]I'll get there right now.
[193:32.00]for some music.
[193:38.42]So here's the bathroom.
[193:43.59]Hold on.
[193:45.79]Like, behind you or... This is the bathroom.
[193:48.91]Where do you go to the bathroom?
[193:50.69]If I have to piss, where do I go?
[193:51.87]Um...
[194:01.00]Alright, so... Is that a security camera?
[194:08.49]Well, you want to have safety.
[194:11.85]And that's the actual design of the room.
[194:15.12]What's in that room?
[194:20.32]What's in that room?
[194:23.19]Which one?
[194:23.41]This one?
[194:23.83]Yeah.
[194:26.21]Alright, you're gonna have to get an extra few points for that.
[194:31.55]You have to get a few points for that.
[194:32.57]You actually tricked me.
[194:34.30]Okay, you get a few more points for that.
[194:38.86]I'm gonna bring complexity down a little because there's no room there, but I brought your creativity up.
[194:44.81]Alright, what's the say on the wall?
[194:48.27]Room?
[194:49.73]Room, okay.
[194:52.73]So you've got... And what's that?
[194:54.82]Is that a... It's a photo of a ninja.
[194:57.50]I don't... I have nothing on this PC.
[194:59.04]So Con... Connor did also sort of a... Sorry.
[195:01.16]I can't talk.
[195:04.48]I can't even hear myself.
[195:06.68]Connor did a similar... If you stand that way and then open it, it won't hit you.
[195:12.34]If you go... Alright.
[195:14.10]Yeah, go... Just turn all the... Turn off the... Turn them all off.
[195:16.94]Yeah, because we haven't been talking.
[195:20.84]Is that question mark to signify the Riddler?
[195:25.36]Whoa.
[195:29.09]That's just to really, you know, I don't think the image loaded.
[195:37.69]That would make sense.
[195:38.80]It's probably an error.
[195:41.58]What was supposed to be there, would you say?
[195:45.42]Honestly, one of the other photos, probably Ninja.
[195:48.23]Okay, alright.
[195:48.99]I just liked the question mark.
[195:50.75]I thought it was artistic itself.
[195:52.39]I'll just be brutally honest.
[195:54.37]I mean, I think it looks great.
[195:56.01]No, what is this?
[195:56.35]You got the solar?
[195:57.95]Oh, that's the solar.
[195:58.91]Okay.
[195:59.59]I thought it was a cell tower.
[196:02.03]And honestly, this is for the rich who just want to throw off burglars and stuff.
[196:09.69]Imagine you came in and you'd have no idea how to get there.
[196:14.84]It would throw me off because it did throw me off because I actually did not know if it was a real room or not.
[196:18.92]So you got me.
[196:21.56]Alright.
[196:21.88]Is there anything else for us to see, Poke?
[196:23.56]Or is that pretty much it?
[196:25.50]Honestly, that's all I was able to figure out.
[196:30.00]Alright, so I'll give you the grades.
[196:30.98]The grades that I have for you so far... I really did like your airport philosophy.
[196:37.10]The reason why your philosophy is so much higher is you have a 95 in philosophy.
[196:41.16]Because I'm... Thank you, thank you.
[196:43.00]I'm getting inside kind of your head a little bit here because you're... You get back.
[196:47.64]You're like, fuck, I'm 30, 40 minutes late.
[196:50.08]I need to do something.
[196:50.96]I'm going to do an airport.
[196:52.07]And it's like, no, you know what, fuck it.
[196:53.49]I'm going to change it from an airport to like an anti-burglar house.
[196:56.43]And then you're like, fuck it, I'm just going to put garage doors everywhere.
[196:59.21]you you were like up against the clock and yes you made it happen and the philosophy of you making that happen and adding these comedic elements is what puts you at a 95 for philosophy unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately
[197:25.63]I was waiting for a sound effect.
[197:31.33]Your cleanliness was pretty much zero.
[197:33.61]It was very dirty outside.
[197:34.79]It was filthy out there.
[197:37.50]It looks like you took a little bit less time.
[197:40.00]That's a trash bag right there.
[197:41.42]Well, it's not a trash bag.
[197:42.20]What is that?
[197:44.41]Oh, I thought that was a trash bag.
[197:46.17]Okay.
[197:47.13]But anyways, you got a 60 for cleanliness.
[197:51.59]It was very dirty.
[197:53.17]Dirty enough where I can't overlook it.
[197:55.62]I would probably give you maybe like a 65 because if you just go outside and just take a look around.
[198:08.31]There's paint cans.
[198:09.27]There's wood.
[198:10.85]The flamethrower ran out.
[198:12.03]Yeah, and like the scaffolding is still there.
[198:16.67]Basement?
[198:17.07]Everyone's saying go to the basement.
[198:18.07]Go to the basement.
[198:18.75]Can you show us the basement?
[198:23.66]Chad, let's get a grade.
[198:29.08]Chad is currently giving you an A. So we're going to the basement.
[198:34.45]It's out of order right now.
[198:36.35]Oh, optical illusion.
[198:37.33]Pretty sick.
[198:39.04]Yeah, I think you nailed it.
[198:40.58]I think you knocked it out of the park.
[198:42.60]It just was very dirty, so that's going to hurt your grade a lot.
[198:45.82]But chat has given you an A, which is a 95.
[198:49.48]So here's where you stand now.
[198:52.76]You stand, Oak.
[198:54.46]You had a creativity of 95.
[198:56.52]That is an A.
[198:59.17]Complexity of an 83.
[199:02.41]Now, the reason why I give... I just... The big paintings on the wall.
[199:06.53]I mean, you even said it yourself.
[199:09.05]You didn't even know what images you had on this computer.
[199:11.53]So, I gotta bring some points down for that.
[199:14.38]So, that's an 83 for complexity.
[199:16.44]Plus, having a garage door for every single door is... You know, it took us a while to open them.
[199:23.02]And they're very loud.
[199:24.64]But your philosophy was a 95.
[199:27.42]Your cleanliness was a 65 and chat gave you a 95 with the grand total poke.
[199:33.31]Your grade in total with this music in the background is you're probably going to be pretty close to being at the top.
[199:43.45]If I'm honest.
[199:45.33]Yes.
[199:47.14]Ooh.
[199:48.46]Wow.
[199:49.94]Alright.
[199:50.30]So you are at an overall grade of 87.5, which puts you Joel had 87.6.
[199:58.58]Oh, wow.
[199:59.44]It was the cleanliness is what killed you.
[200:01.74]Yeah, no, I get that.
[200:02.32]That's worth 15%.
[200:02.98]No, I'll take that.
[200:05.94]Damn.
[200:08.08]87.
[200:08.10]87.5.
[200:09.18]Nice job, Poke.
[200:11.82]Thank you.
[200:14.03]I loved it.
[200:14.35]I loved it.
[200:15.59]Yeah.
[200:16.29]What is it?
[200:17.19]Did you do a... Is that another sponsor?
[200:20.21]I don't even... I don't remember this.
[200:23.01]I think so.
[200:23.69]Yeah, it was actually a fun game.
[200:27.94]Alright.
[200:29.99]What do we have to say about this one?
[200:31.45]This is very good.
[200:33.15]We have some thoughts.
[200:33.79]I would not want to raid this house.
[200:35.21]It would take way too much gunpowder.
[200:37.01]Thank you, guys.
[200:38.66]I love the painted-on doors.
[200:40.36]It's so funny.
[200:41.66]The garage doors.
[200:42.42]Oh, my God.
[200:42.86]It's torturous.
[200:48.39]The idea of each of the first two notes playing from each individual radio that is in every room.
[200:54.99]Did you put that in or is that just there?
[200:58.09]Yeah, I just shortened the song.
[201:02.55]Oh, you took that.
[201:04.07]That's so funny.
[201:04.55]He specifically shortened it.
[201:06.06]Oh, my God.
[201:06.84]If you were upstairs in that home and someone was at the door, you probably wouldn't make it in time.
[201:12.08]I don't think anyone is.
[201:13.50]By the way, I love that you painted the whole outside of the house this spearmint green.
[201:18.43]This took half the time.
[201:20.25]And it's all splotchy.
[201:22.21]Look at how splotchy it is over there.
[201:24.45]The inside of the house was the last 10 minutes.
[201:28.35]I had no idea what I was doing.
[201:30.53]Can I give a point?
[201:31.73]Can I like do a zero decimal one extra point friend point because it's so good.
[201:38.21]Okay.
[201:39.81]Can I like, you know, give points?
[201:43.09]You want to step in and stamp on a point one point?
[201:48.71]I want to see everyone else's things first.
[201:53.40]Let's see everyone else's.
[201:56.16]I appreciate you though, man.
[201:57.42]Damn.
[201:57.94]Thank you.
[202:00.68]Everyone else is doing great too.
[202:01.88]I want to see Ludwig's.
[202:03.89]Yeah, Lud's up next.
[202:05.17]Lud is up next.
[202:07.07]I'm excited.
[202:07.89]Thank you.
[202:11.56]Alright, Poke.
[202:12.44]Thanks a lot, dude.
[202:13.28]It was awesome.
[202:15.40]We'll see how it plays out.
[202:16.30]Alright, Ludwig, are you ready?
[202:20.63]Yep.
[202:21.49]So, Ludwig, I do have to tell you, very importantly, you did get a -2 deduction to philosophy right off the bat.
[202:33.36]I'm sorry, because we had a thing when I unmuted everybody, the first person to complain was the one that was going to get -2 points on their philosophy.
[202:43.32]And I think the first thing you said was like, fuck this, this was stupid.
[202:48.56]No, I didn't say that.
[202:50.04]I would never say that.
[202:51.48]I forget what you said, but it was very funny.
[202:58.36]But I'm willing to scrub those points being deducted.
[203:03.31]Look, it's fine because I think I'm going to score 100 in philosophy.
[203:08.61]And so 98 is still an A plus.
[203:10.87]Okay.
[203:11.17]I'll double it and give it to the next person.
[203:12.87]So you're really confident?
[203:15.33]Yeah, because most of my build sucks.
[203:18.14]I mean, I do not have the expertise of other people.
[203:20.50]I do not have the cleanliness of other people.
[203:23.38]But philosophy is what this whole build is based off.
[203:27.12]Okay.
[203:28.54]And Jerma, I'm getting up there in years.
[203:31.06]I turned 28 this week.
[203:33.46]Yeah, happy birthday, by the way, if everybody didn't know.
[203:37.01]Thank you.
[203:38.01]It's stupid.
[203:39.37]And if this was a low score, it'd make my whole year shattered.
[203:42.33]But what I want you to focus on is history.
[203:47.12]Okay.
[203:49.34]You know what they say about history?
[203:51.34]You know what they say.
[203:52.50]If you do not learn from history, it is doomed to repeat itself.
[203:57.29]Got it.
[203:57.91]You ever heard that?
[203:58.79]I have many times.
[203:59.63]Oh, yeah.
[204:01.12]that's me that said that and and uh and so today we are going to do an homage okay to hh ohms do you know who that is I don't well I'll I'll show you I'll show you because because first and foremost um he's an American okay hear that music I cannot hear the music
[204:32.05]You don't hear like the national anthem playing?
[204:33.63]I don't.
[204:34.01]I can put the national anthem on over here if you want me to.
[204:36.61]No, you're fine.
[204:36.95]You're fine.
[204:37.59]Okay.
[204:37.69]Okay.
[204:38.63]Oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light?
[204:46.18]This
[204:47.01]This is our American garage.
[204:51.17]And it's where we are starting our story today to explain who H.H.
[204:56.33]Holmes is.
[204:57.35]Because at the end of the day, this is a history lesson for you to learn to not repeat what was done in the past.
[205:03.23]Starting with the garage, already a good start.
[205:06.27]Yep.
[205:06.65]Starting with the garage here.
[205:07.77]So H.H.
[205:08.45]Holmes was an American, and I made this garage to dedicate to him.
[205:14.28]um oh you just blew it up no it was a it's an explosive entry it's like oh okay okay yeah let me actually do a little bit of you didn't have sound turned on alright okay I realized now that I didn't I okay I still don't have sound on okay you master volume down yep thanks thanks Connor thanks Connor stop talking to me ever again thanks sorry that was Connor um
[205:44.21]Uh, can you even still hear it though?
[205:45.73]I think it's sharing to my screen.
[205:47.09]Hold up.
[205:47.35]I'm resharing.
[205:47.91]I'm resharing.
[205:48.56]Reshare?
[205:49.04]I'm stopping streaming and restarting.
[205:51.08]Okay.
[205:52.12]Restarting share?
[205:53.80]If you pull the actual game.
[205:55.52]There you are.
[205:55.84]I'm back.
[205:57.05]There we go.
[205:57.39]We got it.
[205:57.69]We got it.
[205:58.11]You can hear the birds.
[205:58.95]Yeah, there we are.
[205:59.67]There we are.
[206:00.63]This is our American garage, red, white, and blue, filled with the American flag.
[206:05.33]Of course, we have our turrets, which is going to come in handy a little bit later when we learn more about H.H.
[206:12.98]Holmes, who, again, you don't know about, right?
[206:15.36]That is a brand-new person.
[206:16.70]I don't even know who that is.
[206:18.22]Great.
[206:18.58]Brand-new person.
[206:19.20]Love that.
[206:19.58]Love that.
[206:19.96]So let's talk more about it as we enter the backyard.
[206:22.14]And you can see here –
[206:23.63]Look at the walls, right?
[206:25.15]Painted all the way through.
[206:25.95]It looks really nice.
[206:26.91]Yeah.
[206:29.13]Do not enter.
[206:29.89]Ooh.
[206:30.73]Okay.
[206:32.71]No doors on the back.
[206:35.16]Nope, because the house was a confusing design because H.H.
[206:38.54]Holmes, Jermo, this is where I should tell you, he was America's first serial killer.
[206:45.96]Oh, okay.
[206:47.74]Okay.
[206:48.36]Yep.
[206:49.68]He was America's first serial killer, and he operated out of Chicago during the Chicago World Fair.
[206:55.51]He fell into some affluence through his family and through killing the leader of a pharmacy and taking over said pharmacy, and through that was able to create the murder castle.
[207:09.06]This feels like a book report, Ludwig.
[207:13.04]I'm teaching you history so it doesn't repeat itself.
[207:15.28]Go on.
[207:16.01]We're here.
[207:17.61]So the murder castle, much like this project, was developed very quickly by many different developers.
[207:24.52]And for me to emulate that, I took suggestions from my chat to create this.
[207:29.48]So you'll notice the long, winding, narrow halls.
[207:35.38]It's like a Gmod map that hasn't had textures put on it.
[207:40.30]White all the way through.
[207:41.12]Very clean, mind you.
[207:42.74]It's very clean.
[207:43.90]I will say, you're starting at 100%.
[207:46.09]Paint everywhere.
[207:47.07]No spots missed at all.
[207:50.09]None, yeah.
[207:51.99]None at all.
[207:54.07]It's a maze house, though.
[207:56.03]It's not a maze.
[207:58.21]And I knew you'd say that because there's been a lot of maze houses today, haven't there?
[208:02.22]There have been.
[208:02.66]There have been at least two.
[208:04.66]The terrifying thing about H.H.
[208:06.42]Holmes is he would- We love mazes.
[208:08.14]No, this is not a maze, Connor.
[208:09.96]I'm not like you.
[208:10.40]That'd be cringe.
[208:12.00]H.H.
[208:12.32]Holmes used several different contractors to make his house.
[208:15.82]That way, no individual except for him knew the layout of the home.
[208:19.06]He would then use it as a hotel during the Chicago World Fair that people would stay at.
[208:22.88]And from the second floor, he would have a trap door to bring people to the first floor.
[208:30.02]What is that?
[208:31.10]Okay, that's from My Hero Academia.
[208:34.21]What does it have to do with... Did you hear what I said, Jeremiah?
[208:35.81]Yeah, but what does it have to do with H.H.
[208:36.87]Holmes, My Hero Academia?
[208:39.19]Well, don't worry about this.
[208:40.61]This is just to show the explosiveness of the trapdoor.
[208:45.97]Bro, alright, that's pretty cool.
[208:47.77]That's actually pretty cool.
[208:48.92]Okay, I'm going to have to get... We're starting a little bit high here.
[208:53.44]That was, you used the environment to make something happen.
[208:56.91]And I'm gonna, you're actually pretty high.
[208:59.03]I thought it was just a white house at first.
[209:01.87]Okay, you got me.
[209:02.61]That would be embarrassing.
[209:04.21]You got me here.
[209:05.05]I'm actually here now.
[209:05.95]You got me now.
[209:08.23]Well, let me get you with a hook then.
[209:09.53]Yep.
[209:11.94]The way H.H.
[209:12.82]Holmes would kill all his victims was by having them go through a trap door into the basement where they'd be eaten alive and
[209:22.56]by rats really that's terrifying yeah that's horrifying yeah your cleanliness just went down horrifying 10 points well it's a trap to refer it's it's the rat room it's the rat room they're they're located within the rat room but there are rats in your house so we have to be fair but it's in the trapdoor rat room where you're supposed to kill people so it makes sense that the rats are here
[209:45.31]What's on the wall there?
[209:48.50]This is... If looks could kill, you know what I mean?
[209:55.96]Okay.
[209:56.62]So this is where... Is that a poker table?
[209:59.58]Blackjack table?
[210:00.12]What's over there?
[210:00.70]What's the philosophy for that being in here?
[210:03.54]I figured the rats would get bored.
[210:05.38]And I wanted to put a poker table for them to play poker at.
[210:08.38]Okay.
[210:09.12]Alright.
[210:09.76]This is...
[210:14.09]This is, I hope, an eye-opening about the dangers of the past and how not knowing them could make them happen in the future.
[210:25.58]And what I want you to understand- Are you going to kill me?
[210:30.16]What does that mean?
[210:31.84]Are you going to kill me?
[210:33.26]I'm just teaching.
[210:34.54]This is educational.
[210:35.56]It's educational.
[210:37.85]I want to teach you to just be wary in the future.
[210:40.57]If you ever go to a hotel, make sure it's from a reputable source because you could end up in H.H.
[210:45.74]Holmes' murder castle.
[210:52.66]That's the end of the tour.
[210:53.36]Oh, alright.
[210:54.70]Shit.
[210:55.04]Okay.
[210:56.20]That's the whole tour.
[210:59.08]I spent most of the time painting everything white.
[211:01.82]Everything was white.
[211:03.66]We have a few questions.
[211:06.14]Please, please go ahead.
[211:07.54]I have a few important questions.
[211:09.22]Number one, where's the bathroom?
[211:13.14]That's a great question.
[211:13.94]The bathroom.
[211:14.92]Let me bring it to you right now.
[211:20.92]Right here.
[211:21.93]okay so you did okay so this is a bathroom this is the toilet bathroom got it got it okay I do appreciate the fact that it's outside can you go ahead just give me give me the outdoor look again I want no trash no no here right oh yeah yeah no no no here at all you know I cleaned up the entire yard uh chopped down the trees in the front I thought they were a bit tacky okay some weeds grew back just because the game was open but you know they were they were gone earlier it's
[211:48.87]So here's what I've got so far.
[211:50.77]I like the fact that you did the garage.
[211:53.42]A lot of people just didn't even... There's only two or three people that even stepped foot in the garage, it seems.
[211:58.96]I do appreciate the fact that the garage is done.
[212:01.94]So Chad is going to be grading your house right now.
[212:03.81]I'm going to give you my grades that I have so far.
[212:05.59]And you can argue with me if you want.
[212:06.79]We can go through it.
[212:08.05]I wouldn't dare.
[212:09.53]So creativity, I got you at an 85.
[212:11.87]The fuck?
[212:12.95]Sorry.
[212:14.87]What?
[212:15.48]Why?
[212:15.96]85.
[212:15.98]Why do you hate me?
[212:18.00]I got you to creativity 85 for a couple of specific reasons.
[212:21.66]One.
[212:21.82]Okay.
[212:22.74]I like the philosophy.
[212:24.36]The philosophy is actually where you're going to get some points back here.
[212:27.20]Because you took a theme and your whole house is a gigantic...
[212:35.27]I got a gigantic history lesson.
[212:37.30]That's really interesting.
[212:39.10]I gave you a 93.
[212:39.80]I gave you a 93 for philosophy.
[212:43.49]You also... Okay, and that includes the -2?
[212:46.38]You have 91.
[212:46.62]So it's a 95.
[212:47.02]You have a 91 in philosophy.
[212:48.96]Oh.
[212:49.32]So I forgot to do that.
[212:50.02]Can I interject for just a moment?
[212:51.36]I apologize on my turn.
[212:54.56]I want to just point out that if you go to that basement, right?
[212:57.21]Sorry, the garage, right?
[212:58.25]And you flip it upside down.
[212:59.67]Can you show them what we have in the basement?
[213:02.55]The garage, sorry.
[213:03.11]Can you flip it upside down?
[213:04.43]How do you flip it upside down?
[213:05.91]Can you flip it upside down?
[213:07.59]How do you do that?
[213:08.57]Flip it.
[213:09.79]Can you flip it?
[213:10.63]How do you flip it?
[213:11.53]Ludwig, Chad is giving you an F on your house.
[213:13.67]How do you flip it, Connor?
[213:14.69]Flip it.
[213:15.07]Flip it.
[213:16.43]You keep saying flip it.
[213:18.15]Flip the house.
[213:18.97]Flip the house.
[213:19.47]Do it.
[213:20.39]Is it like a command?
[213:22.19]Am I doing it?
[213:27.28]Oh, you're flipping the house to see what it looks like upside down?
[213:29.86]He's asking me to flip it.
[213:31.72]I don't know how to flip it.
[213:33.20]Only Etalyx knows how to do that.
[213:34.38]He's the only one that knows how to do that.
[213:36.04]grab okay look alright close close the garage door close it okay yeah how do you flip the house grab uh alright I gotta do that inside okay I'm inside the house and then I type in grav okay blood you had a great intro you had your intro you were like informed you were ready you had your your history that was a rattle by Connor right now
[214:01.80]What I'm trying to say is, this is not an American room.
[214:04.10]This is a hidden French room, which is everything that America doesn't stand for.
[214:08.53]If you flip it upside down, it's just a French flag of a room.
[214:11.91]There's no stars.
[214:12.91]Where's the stars?
[214:16.89]It's red, white, and blue.
[214:18.61]And look on the outside.
[214:20.21]It's a hidden French room.
[214:22.23]Look at all the stars.
[214:24.42]It's red, white, and blue.
[214:25.38]I can't get rid of this thing now, Connor.
[214:26.90]You've stressed me out.
[214:28.66]I'm sorry.
[214:28.92]I'll leave you to it now.
[214:30.12]I don't even know how to get rid.
[214:32.66]Alright, I got my final grades for you, Ludwig.
[214:35.16]And don't worry, I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[214:37.93]Okay, okay.
[214:38.41]So, philosophy, you get a 91.
[214:40.01]That's an A. That's an A-.
[214:41.25]And we had an awesome history lesson.
[214:43.49]I really do enjoy the fact that you utilized the garage.
[214:46.63]You didn't just go over there and into the house and not do anything with all the pieces.
[214:50.25]You used all the pieces.
[214:51.53]Painting, this took a long time.
[214:53.01]That's why you also get a pretty high score.
[214:54.53]It took most of my time, and I realized most people didn't paint shit and then put funny objects inside.
[214:58.96]Yeah.
[215:00.24]So that was a...
[215:01.70]You're an 85 for creativity.
[215:05.14]Look at this.
[215:05.62]Over here is painted.
[215:07.08]Look at that.
[215:09.20]I'm going to give you a couple extra points for complexity.
[215:13.45]I painted in every available corner.
[215:15.75]Yeah, your cleanliness is only a 90 because there was rats.
[215:19.81]And I know that's on theme and on brand and everything.
[215:23.61]It's part of the story.
[215:24.29]It's part of the story.
[215:24.75]So I'll give you a 92 on cleanliness.
[215:27.13]You get a 91 philosophy, 92 cleanliness, 80 complexity, 85 creativity, and chat's grade is a 60.
[215:34.13]Is that the worst chat grade for anyone today?
[215:37.29]That's the worst chat grade that can possibly go out.
[215:39.25]And they must have it out for you for some reason.
[215:40.93]I don't know why.
[215:42.73]You know what?
[215:43.13]I've deserved it from DayDot, and they saw through me.
[215:46.12]So your final grade, Ludwig.
[215:48.59]It's probably going to be... Let's find out.
[215:53.85]If only the music played through, it probably could have helped.
[215:57.05]But you did put music through.
[215:58.21]I really thought I had... The music would have really helped the end reveal.
[216:01.27]It would have been huge.
[216:03.44]Alright, I got you at 92 cleanliness.
[216:07.14]I got you at a 91 philosophy.
[216:09.54]60 is pretty solid.
[216:12.50]60, which puts you at a final score.
[216:17.08]You are at an 83.2 for your final score.
[216:19.94]That is a B, a nearly B-.
[216:22.66]How does that stack up?
[216:24.36]You're kind of right in the middle.
[216:25.59]I do appreciate the whole... So, here's the thing about theming.
[216:29.51]So, everyone else that had a theme, they didn't stick with it.
[216:32.23]A lot of the theming was kind of all, you know, okay, we're starting with this theme, but we're moving on to other themes.
[216:36.66]Your entire theme...
[216:38.88]was this H.H.
[216:41.20]Holmes serial killer house.
[216:43.58]It was the entire thing.
[216:45.29]It was a mistake, Jeremiah.
[216:46.93]I should have just filled up 12 rooms with 12 different things and thrown the Green Goblin in and done a little funny voice.
[216:54.03]I don't need to give you guys a history lesson.
[216:55.61]It's your day off.
[216:56.31]Yeah, you gave us a history lesson.
[216:58.40]I'm glad you're learning.
[216:59.42]You definitely would benefit from some funny voices, I think.
[217:03.00]He was rumored...
[217:04.64]to have killed between 20 and 200 people um so I just had to get through the rest of this report uh although nine were only ever found uh in here oh oh House Flipper drama oh no no I'm not talking I'm saying it's what I should have done I should have shambles the community's falling apart right now
[217:25.51]No, I'm not talking trash.
[217:26.65]I should have made a poorly designed tacky house filled with furniture that I downloaded offline.
[217:30.66]No, you're not talking trash.
[217:31.30]You're making trash houses.
[217:32.98]Okay, well, it's an American house, and it's very clean, right?
[217:36.48]This is a garage that you would expect.
[217:37.82]French house.
[217:38.57]It's a French house.
[217:39.17]It's not a French house.
[217:40.65]Red, white, blue, and there's stars.
[217:41.93]And I couldn't figure out how to get the stars on the ceiling.
[217:43.97]I couldn't figure out how to get the stars on the ceiling.
[217:45.61]But here's the thing.
[217:47.67]You painted... Connor, you too.
[217:50.70]Connor, you had points, a lot of points, in cleanliness and in philosophy because it actually is a huge pain in the ass to paint every single wall in this game.
[218:01.04]It's a huge pain in the ass.
[218:02.35]Even if the wall is completely one color, it's a huge pain in the ass to paint every single color.
[218:07.29]It's Liberty Blue, okay?
[218:08.89]Tell me that's not American.
[218:10.13]Liberty Blue.
[218:11.01]Anyway.
[218:11.31]I don't want to... I don't...
[218:14.47]I guess that's actually a good point.
[218:18.21]Well, I don't want to take up too much of your time here, Jerma.
[218:20.37]I'm happy with my score.
[218:21.83]Jerma's chat, sorry I disappointed you, but I hope you learned a lesson.
[218:26.33]Hey, I learned something today that I didn't know before.
[218:31.55]That's all that matters.
[218:32.33]Actually, true statement.
[218:35.45]Be safe out there.
[218:36.05]Alright, I'll see you at work.
[218:37.57]Did you learn that five to seven minutes is a lot longer than you thought it was?
[218:41.93]uh how long was that because that to me felt like an eternity I usually go about one to two minutes but who's who's next uh we got coming up next is I believe it is doug doug doug doug is next right yes we've got only there's only two people left there's doug doug and Connor and then we can give out our we can see our final grades
[219:03.75]I'm in there.

[219:05.65]That's right.
[219:06.03]That's right.
[219:06.51]That's right.
[219:06.95]That's right.
[219:07.53]That's right.
[219:08.45]Because we moved you, right?
[219:09.27]We moved you.
[219:09.99]Alright.
[219:10.23]So, actually, we'll do DougDoug, then we'll do RT, then we'll do Connor.
[219:16.46]Connor, you're going to round us out.
[219:17.82]Alright.
[219:19.20]I'm ready.
[219:19.62]I think it'll be a good one.
[219:21.78]Alright.
[219:22.44]Here we go.
[219:23.40]Let's make sure we get this looking good.
[219:25.16]This is DougDoug coming up here.
[219:26.66]I'm doing 30 frames at 1080.
[219:29.26]Let me know if this is alright.
[219:31.31]Should be good.
[219:32.51]Let's find out.
[219:35.00]Oh, that looks good.
[219:36.97]Looks good.
[219:37.63]Alright.
[219:38.37]Doug, Doug, we are ready for your presentation.
[219:41.52]Now, look, I enjoyed hearing Ludwig's origin story as much as the next guy.
[219:44.52]There have been some great houses here today.
[219:46.42]But, Jerma, I'm ready to take you to the happiest place on Earth.
[219:51.00]Okay.
[219:51.64]Dugneyland, a legally distinct version of Disneyland with everybody's favorite mascot, Dickie Mouse.
[219:58.61]Now, Jerma, what is your favorite ride at Disneyland?
[220:02.11]Goofy.
[220:02.59]Oh, that isn't a character.
[220:06.49]Space Mountain.
[220:08.76]That is down for construction, unfortunately.
[220:11.76]As we walk into Main Street Avenue, you're going to notice lots of shops, lots of different areas of Dugneyland.
[220:17.90]You're going to notice Goofy's Castle, as well as the Epcot Center, and all of those lovely houses around Main Street that we all know and love as you walk down Disneyland, I mean, Dugneyland Avenue.
[220:30.85]Very beautiful.
[220:31.93]The walls are fully painted.
[220:33.53]Wow.
[220:34.17]Okay.
[220:34.57]Looking good.
[220:36.18]Let's start.
[220:37.62]Let's go to Dickie's Toontown.
[220:39.32]Everybody loves Toontown.
[220:40.46]You have all your favorite characters, like Goofy and Docky and Cow.
[220:45.84]Yep, yep.
[220:47.00]I love the cow.
[220:48.18]The cow is one of my favorite characters.
[220:50.05]Notice the cartoon flooring really evokes that feeling of like you've been transported into a cartoon world.
[220:56.25]And chat?
[220:57.23]this might be a bit scary we're gonna head into haunted mansion next oh you're gonna notice that haunted mansion is actually yes sea dog a maze and as we go in oh god sorry sorry um there's terrifying photos up on the walls you don't know which direction you're going you're moving left and right where the hell is uh this oh look at how scary oh another ghost this place is terrifying right really really gets you into the mood not even for children because of how scary this is
[221:22.69]I genuinely don't remember where the ending is uh oh can I start to wonder can I pause you for one second even let me pause you for one second you made an actual maze Connor your maze was just like a curly q with with pictures from your computer it was very good but this is a this is this
[221:44.14]No, no, I'm just saying, this is like the first real maze of the night.
[221:47.79]Of the four or five mazes.
[221:48.95]This is a real maze.
[221:49.89]Look at the mini-map!
[222:01.66]I just met Doug Doug for the first time like fucking a month ago I literally am lost I do not know how to get out of this so we might need to stall for a few okay whoa another ghost watch out for that ghost wait
[222:18.74]Oh, I'm back at the entrance.
[222:19.54]Okay, that's not a bit.
[222:21.00]Okay, hold on.
[222:21.78]We'll get to the end.
[222:22.60]One sec.
[222:22.96]Alright.
[222:23.86]As you continue along the haunted mansion, it gets scarier and scarier.
[222:28.20]Did the creators of Dugneyland even finish this maze?
[222:30.74]Is there anything actually waiting at the end?
[222:32.46]Is it going to be as scary as those ghosts have been until finally you go even farther and you reveal Jared Fogle's bedroom with a children's bed in front of it?
[222:42.72]Ah!
[222:44.24]Truly a haunted...
[222:46.98]ride that any man or child would love that's pretty funny any questions on haunted mansion that I honestly you're the first of all you're the first person you're the first person that made a real maze look at the mini map look at the mini map go back to the maze and go into the mini map you had actual places where you couldn't really go and then you had to go through a different spot you got lost in your own maze
[223:14.78]That's a disaster.
[223:16.60]Intentionally, right?
[223:20.43]Complexity, I got you at a 98 right now, by the way.
[223:23.33]A 98.
[223:26.04]And let me tell you, this is just I am lost one second.
[223:28.40]This is just Haunted Mansion.
[223:29.92]Alright.
[223:30.42]Don't even get me started on Adventureland.
[223:32.92]OK, here we go.
[223:33.26]Here we go.
[223:33.54]Alright.
[223:34.03]So as you leave the Haunted Mansion, you're a little spooked, right?
[223:37.09]You need something to chill out with.
[223:38.75]Maybe you want to go to Tomorrowland, the future of tomorrow or whatever Walt Disney said.
[223:43.91]And Tomorrowland is all of the highest technology that we could find.
[223:48.96]uh there's oh there's technological cubes there's technological cubes look at these tech cubes I think it's a cabinet there's technological paintings which I don't think anybody else had the walls fully tiled with some of the most cyberpunk tomorrowland stuff you can find and a bed I do have furniture in this house yes okay I I do have a question yes what is the philosophy of the placement of the technological cubes because they look a little scattered
[224:15.29]Yeah.
[224:15.89]Have you seen the movie Alien?
[224:20.79]Yes.
[224:22.09]It was random.
[224:22.75]I've just put them everywhere.
[224:23.88]Oh, okay.
[224:24.34]Okay.
[224:24.66]Alright.
[224:26.18]Okay.
[224:26.58]Yeah, that looks fantastic.
[224:27.92]I love it.
[224:28.56]I love Tomorrow World, whatever you're going to call it in your royalty-free, copyright-free version.
[224:33.69]Right, right, right, right.
[224:34.33]Yeah, it's fair use because of the cubes.
[224:39.04]Let's head back downstairs.
[224:40.62]I want to show you our backyard.
[224:42.28]Okay.
[224:43.02]Other people tried to make prim and proper little boring lawns.
[224:46.38]Nobody likes that.
[224:47.10]Nobody likes suburbia.
[224:47.82]What you want is adventure land.
[224:50.00]This outdoor has a mix of different plants and foliage.
[224:52.76]It even has a swimming pool.
[224:54.96]The deep end has a swimming pool.
[224:56.82]Adventure land is something for everybody.
[224:58.67]Look at this bonsai tree.
[225:00.11]Pretty cool, right?
[225:00.81]This is actually a pretty damn good backyard.
[225:03.53]There we go!
[225:04.23]Ooh, I- I- I- I'm- I am- I am- I don't know, Doug- Doug, this is... This is looking pretty solid.
[225:15.70]Uh... Okay.
[225:16.44]Can I- Can I- Can you do me a favor?
[225:18.42]Yeah.
[225:18.94]Could you go to the garage?
[225:20.64]Again.
[225:22.91]Sorry, you mean... what garage?
[225:24.81]I would like you to go to the garage.
[225:27.74]The garage, Doug.
[225:29.16]Are you talking about Jermaversal Studios?
[225:31.74]That place is a dump.
[225:33.08]My park is much better.
[225:34.50]Don't go anywhere near Jermaversal.
[225:37.75]I love how you just put it.
[225:39.77]I want you to open the garage.
[225:42.23]Open it.
[225:43.01]The standards at Jermaversal Studios are very subpar.
[225:46.21]I don't even think they have a ride in here.
[225:47.79]Okay.
[225:51.05]I appreciate the fact that you hid the garage.
[225:54.93]Yeah, that park sucks.
[225:56.53]yeah there's not much in that there's not much in that park not much in that park certainly not the happiest place on Earth now it's very clean it's very clean the parking lot there's a parking lot yeah I took out the garage door and put in a wall oh okay alright but why is there a door to the park how a car is supposed to get in here
[226:20.68]Dog, dog, dog, dog.
[226:21.62]What's that right there in the lower left next to the door?
[226:24.38]Oh, boy.
[226:25.84]That, somebody parked their car in the wrong spot.
[226:31.75]Doug, the door is not even in the frame either.
[226:34.63]Ooh, but that's, again, some rogue driver.
[226:38.79]Have you been to Disneyland?
[226:39.57]Have you been to the parking lot?
[226:40.35]These people do not know how to drive.
[226:42.96]Can I ask a question, Jerm?
[226:44.38]I hate to cut in.
[226:45.22]Yeah, go ahead.
[226:47.02]Why was the garage not the parking lot?
[226:51.04]Jerma.
[226:52.24]Jerma.
[226:52.58]Excuse me.
[226:53.78]Hold on.
[226:55.24]That's true.
[226:56.36]Why was the garage not the parking lot?
[226:59.20]Look, you have to build around what the people want.
[227:02.12]Some guy charged his Ford F-150 through my walls and made a huge mess.
[227:06.90]And so I built the walls around it and that became the parking lot.
[227:09.67]That's why there's this disaster here.
[227:10.93]None of this was my fault.
[227:12.65]Well, life gives you lemons.
[227:14.81]I do appreciate the parking sign though.
[227:16.81]That is very nice.
[227:17.91]I do love it.
[227:19.73]It is parking for a Segway.
[227:21.87]Can we go into the ball pit?
[227:23.39]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[227:25.40]So one of our most popular rides is ball pit land.
[227:31.54]And if you've been wondering where the bathroom is, don't worry.
[227:34.18]Splash Mountain has you covered.
[227:35.92]I was just going to ask it.
[227:36.82]You have multiple pools that you can swim and frolic in.
[227:40.26]And if you need to go to the bathroom, we do have a urinal at the very end.
[227:43.14]If you can kind of jump up.
[227:44.32]Yeah, I was going to say, are you peeing out of the water to get to that?
[227:48.97]Um, I think if you jump across, you could sort of time it in bursts.
[227:54.59]And if you need to take a shit, you can go in the pool.
[227:57.33]So nobody is swimming in these pools?
[228:00.17]Well, I was sort of thinking maybe the middle one would be the shit pool, and then Splash Mountain is the first and the third.
[228:08.01]Okay, I get you.
[228:09.47]So one of these is used as a place to use the bathroom, and the other ones can be used as a pool.
[228:14.37]I'm pretty sure if we put enough chlorine in these, nobody's going to notice.
[228:19.44]I'm going to dock you on cleanliness for a minute.
[228:20.92]That's filthy.
[228:22.82]I'm going to have to drop you on cleanliness.
[228:24.90]Have you ever been in a wave pool?
[228:27.30]Those things are bright yellow.
[228:28.88]Everybody just puts up with it.
[228:29.94]That's part of the amusement park experience.
[228:32.42]I am torn because you have philosophically probably...
[228:36.87]one of the best I would say one of the best grades here philosophically speaking this is wonderful and I'm trying to figure out is this a 95 is this a higher score is this a 96 or is this I I'm I'm epcot you have epcot we've got blood in um every other contestant has been spot checked on the corner next to the garage
[229:06.37]true can we see the corner of the garage dog dog the corner oh oh right right right yeah see that as part of our adventure land expansion was left untidy let me back let's check it oh um everybody neglects the hooligans in this part everybody needs to get in there and kick them out we're if if the park is successful enough we will purchase Jerm reversal studios and just kick them out of here this has gone on too long
[229:33.33]I'm gonna give you a 100 on creativity, because I really think you deserve it.
[229:37.57]I think you actually deserve a perfect score for creativity.
[229:40.85]I think you absolutely nailed it.
[229:45.08]You had to bring in custom things here, and I think you absolutely crushed it.
[229:49.24]On complexity, I'm gonna give you a 94.
[229:51.70]There were some doors that weren't really in their own place.
[229:56.03]There were some walls that were constructionally had some problems.
[229:58.13]The garage wasn't anything there.
[229:59.95]There also was the problem with the dirt and the debris to the left of the garage.
[230:04.22]But I do think it was phenomenal.
[230:06.42]Do you have a second floor?
[230:09.60]Uh, yeah, that's Tomorrowland.
[230:10.90]So, yeah, that was part of the second floor, right.
[230:13.34]Okay.
[230:14.00]So, just making sure, like, is this all there was on the second floor?
[230:17.67]Yeah, yeah.
[230:18.31]Nothing behind?
[230:18.69]Okay.
[230:19.31]And the door, if we see the Tomorrowland door, it's a little... That's also perfectly locked into place.
[230:26.31]You see, in the future of Tomorrow, doors are more of a philosophical concept.
[230:31.02]Very philosophical, I might add.
[230:35.84]I love it.
[230:36.24]I think it was fantastic.
[230:37.08]I think you're gonna get probably at least an A. Uh, we need to see what chat says.
[230:40.68]What is chat giving for a grade?
[230:43.93]Chat is also giving you an A. So you- that is also- that is a full nine- that is a 95 from chat.
[230:49.61]Thank you, chat.
[230:49.97]You've got a- you've got a great, great score here.
[230:52.95]Let's figure it out.
[230:53.99]You're gonna be, uh, pretty high.
[230:56.11]Probably top of the class, I'd say.
[230:57.19]Pretty high.
[231:00.46]94 in complexity.
[231:02.06]A 90 in cleanliness.
[231:03.66]So that back area really gets everybody.
[231:06.72]Philosophy.
[231:07.37]I feel like you did a lot with your philosophy here.
[231:13.83]I think it's a little low.
[231:15.69]And you got to admit with the doors, consistent, consistent philosophy throughout.
[231:19.95]I'm going to give you a 97 for philosophy.
[231:22.27]Let's go.
[231:23.55]I really think that it should be somewhere higher than a day.
[231:28.17]And then chat's grade is also an A, which puts you at a grand total of... 96.0.
[231:35.21]Thank you, Chef.
[231:41.06]Metallics is currently at 96.5.
[231:44.82]Both 96s.
[231:47.04]You both should be very proud of yourselves for your creativity, complexity, cleanliness.
[231:53.61]Wonderful, wonderful job.
[231:54.61]Doug, Doug, that was fucking phenomenal.
[231:56.71]Thank you.
[232:00.12]Alright, so we got one more.
[232:01.68]We have ConnorEatsPants as the last one.
[232:05.05]Oh my god, why can I not think?
[232:08.49]You know why?
[232:09.05]Get Jared off the screen.
[232:11.49]No, get Jared off the screen.
[232:13.71]Jared jump scared me.
[232:14.65]Jared jump scared me.
[232:16.19]It's because I'm looking over at my sheet and because we moved you, you're like not on the sheet over here anymore.
[232:22.36]So you're like out of my brain.
[232:23.80]Alright, it's your turn.
[232:26.56]RT, I promise.
[232:28.10]I promise, I promise, I promise.
[232:29.86]Alright, let's get it.
[232:31.55]Let's get it, let's get it.
[232:32.48]Let me gear up for this um stream quality is it better text readability and 30 FPS, is it?
[232:38.00]Yes.
[232:40.00]He hates RT. He hates RT.
[232:43.00]Discord crashing is going to be your worst nightmare now.
[232:47.22]No, it... Alright, let me take a look.
[232:48.78]Uh, can you move around?
[232:50.18]Well, what did, um... No!
[232:50.66]No!
[233:13.40]No!
[233:13.88]Carby Dreamhouse.
[233:16.60]Based on the old dollhouse toys for you to play with today.
[233:23.67]Let's make our way onside, but first and foremost, haven't just left this out here.
[233:27.36]What do you mean you haven't left it out here?
[233:29.83]Here's some strawberry ice cream to take with you.
[233:32.89]We thought about it.
[233:33.87]Oh.
[233:34.15]We thought about it thematically.
[233:35.77]Holy shit.
[233:36.77]So let's step on inside.
[233:37.81]Holy shit.
[233:38.45]The idea was to try and get the classic feel of a traditional Barbie playhouse.
[233:43.34]You know, so it's a bit plasticky feeling as you go through it, but the color's uniform.
[233:48.12]Have a little elegance of style.
[233:49.62]You have your nice windows.
[233:50.71]You have your lights.
[233:52.59]A little bit of air to kind of get in here.
[233:54.29]Retro TV.
[233:55.39]Because you would have like kind of old toys based on this.
[233:58.63]Like kind of little old things that you stick in the house when you play with one of these toys.
[234:02.77]That's back in the day.
[234:04.07]You know?
[234:04.85]I tried to kind of really base it on kind of like the earlier ones from the 60s when Mattel were making these way, way back.
[234:10.38]So we've actually got open access back.
[234:12.66]Just so you can kind of get your hands in there, you know if you're playing with as a kid.
[234:15.00]You've got your kitchen unit of course you can play with it too.
[234:17.00]You also have a complete poolside beach area.
[234:22.00]We've sanded down a lot of the garden here but also some grassy patches just to try and make it look distinct. Got to get the Barbie brand in here as well.
[234:29.00]Sure, okay.
[234:31.00]You get a lot of stickers of Barbie in these old play sets too, just to really kind of hammer home what it is. You know they're big on the brand and they were back in the day.
[234:39.24]We got- we built our own little bench here.
[234:41.00]Assemble this so you can just have it like a nice little-
[234:42.00]Hold on, pause for a second, pause. This is all very wonderful, you've even got the little dirt.
[234:47.00]You've got the dirt under the bench in an artistic way.
[234:53.00]Because your legs are going to kick some of it away, no we thought about that.
[234:54.00]Yeah that's just like- you- you've shaped it you've- you've sculpted this is- this is a sculpture. This is a sculpture you've made.
[235:03.42]Okay, continue.
[235:03.96]You're way too kind.
[235:04.98]You're way too kind.
[235:06.10]We have like a more little sticker of Barbie here as well, just so she greets you when you're coming in the door.
[235:09.96]You have a lot of these things just as you go about in the house.
[235:13.30]If we take a look upstairs, we tried again to just try and give this kind of an open feeling.
[235:18.15]We got all the essentials.
[235:19.09]Here is all of Barbie's clothes.
[235:22.13]You know, Barbie famous for her fashion through the years.
[235:24.85]We really want to make sure that we have that as part of it.
[235:27.37]Here is a classic kind of style bedroom.
[235:29.17]We went for a bit of an urban feel, maybe in the back a bit, but also kind of want to keep it true to Barbie.
[235:33.79]We have that in here.
[235:34.95]Were the walls not being pink a time constraint?
[235:39.52]No, no.
[235:40.18]It was actually a deliberate choice.
[235:41.48]We wanted kind of the contrast in background because it makes these walls pop more if you actually have a brick wall in the back.
[235:48.06]In a lot of urban dwellings, you'll kind of get that look.
[235:50.96]And actually, they incorporated that in some of the classic Barbie dream houses.
[235:54.06]I'll have you know.
[235:54.88]My grandmother had one.
[235:57.14]Is that true?
[235:57.60]Somebody look that up.
[235:58.72]Is that true?
[235:59.24]Somebody look that up.
[235:59.78]If it's true, I'll put it higher.
[236:03.61]We have a wardrobe room here as well, of course, because, you know, you can go through your outfits.
[236:08.49]Now, we do have one bit.
[236:09.67]Now, this is classic, and I debated doing it this way.
[236:14.46]Okay.
[236:16.70]There is extensive use of stickers in old Barbie homes, especially for details like toilets and that, because you only get so much plastic in the set.
[236:25.74]so you really make use of yes they make use of sticker elements for some of these features in the house because otherwise it would just ramp up the retail price and I want to try and stay true to the vision of it being a toy and you know affordable in that sense ludwig ludwig this is a history lesson and it's not about a guy that murdered people go on
[236:50.00]This is the majority of the house here.
[236:52.44]We cannot back outside.
[236:53.52]We have working lights as well.
[236:54.86]We wired all these up.
[236:55.80]They work?
[236:56.54]You have working lights?
[236:57.52]Are you the only one that made working lights in the whole game?
[237:00.32]No, wait.
[237:01.93]Somebody else did.
[237:03.07]Did somebody else have working lights?
[237:07.57]I don't think anybody had working functioning electricity.
[237:09.83]I did.
[237:10.23]I just forgot to show it.
[237:11.71]Oh, okay.
[237:13.19]He's already killed me by now.
[237:16.19]You've already died already.
[237:18.80]Now we can just sit by the pool with our lovely strawberry ice cream and just soak in the day.
[237:23.96]We have flowers all over the garden.
[237:25.26]Yeah, can I see the flowers?
[237:27.48]Yeah, of course.
[237:28.38]We have a lot on the purple ones here.
[237:29.76]We have this border edge guard of these kind of plastic pots.
[237:35.20]It's weird because I'm trying to represent this feeling a bit of plastic as we kind of go about the property.
[237:41.22]Because again, the toys were the reference point for this.
[237:43.86]Let's talk up on some more strawberry ice cream.
[237:46.96]RT, can you open the garage, please?
[237:50.06]So, I did think about the garage.
[237:52.24]In official Dream Houses back in the day, the garage would actually be sold separately, as would Barbie's car.
[237:57.90]So, it's not included.
[238:01.94]It's not included.
[238:03.56]I actually wanted to remove the garage entirely in the property, because to kind of hammer home the idea of it being sold separately.
[238:11.18]Because it wouldn't be included.
[238:12.34]That would be a separate place, that and that.
[238:13.68]And we were focused on Barbie's Dream Clubhouse here.
[238:18.13]Alright.
[238:19.71]That's a good answer.
[238:21.13]That's a good answer.
[238:23.51]Can you check the corner to the left of the garage?
[238:26.97]The corner to the left of the garage?
[238:28.29]Sure thing.
[238:29.05]Just one sec.
[238:32.63]It's clean.
[238:33.79]Oh, you get to keep the 100 on clean.
[238:36.28]No, don't worry.
[238:37.02]Attention to detail.
[238:38.02]Like, you know, I want to keep the garden kind of nice, pristine and proper.
[238:42.72]I really like actually kind of like adding the sand in this as we were going about too.
[238:46.46]I just thought I'd add it a bit.
[238:47.90]Just sort of a bit of contrast from like kind of just modern suburbia that you're getting here and like everyone just doing kind of grassy gardens.
[238:54.61]I thought it would look a bit more distinct.
[238:56.75]And again, it's the idea of kind of this dream clubhouse and thinking of the beach and things like that.
[239:01.51]Yeah, the sand is bringing me to the beach.
[239:04.57]That's really wonderful.
[239:05.97]Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
[239:08.55]Thank you very much.
[239:10.91]I have to... I'm fighting with giving you a 98 or a 100 on creativity.
[239:14.75]I'm trying to... It's a 98.
[239:17.78]It's a 98, I think, for creativity.
[239:18.96]It could be 100.
[239:21.34]That is very kind.
[239:22.70]That is very kind of you.
[239:25.20]It's a 90.
[239:28.89]a 90 it's a oh it's a 99. it's an oh my god you're alright your creativity I'm giving you 99 your your complexity I'm giving you an 89 and it's not because it's not a complex house it's because it's it's a it's a more it's it's it's a home this is a regular home it's not very it's not a very complex home
[239:56.00]this is a home this is like modeled after those old Barbie toys which is exactly the old Barbie toys so you don't actually want too much clutter in there exactly I've tried I've tried to kind of push over though and add as much details as I can like stuff with the lights and that that's true um you know plants inside just to kind of make it look nice
[240:14.18]But your philosophy, you've got a 100.
[240:15.70]I think you nailed it on sticking with the theme.
[240:20.30]You pulled the theme the whole time.
[240:21.82]There's not a whole lot of structural problems.
[240:24.52]It's very, very nicely made.
[240:26.16]All the wiring works in the house.
[240:27.42]Everything works.
[240:28.96]That's a 100 for philosophy.
[240:30.18]That's a 100 for cleanliness.
[240:31.74]This is going to be... You're going to be... It's going to be close.
[240:33.73]You might be ahead of the class.
[240:34.45]We're going to see what chat's grade is.
[240:37.25]Chat is... I didn't expect this, honestly.
[240:39.17]Chat is unanimously giving you an A, a 95.
[240:41.03]Oh, my God.
[240:44.10]So, I think it's very possible.
[240:46.68]We'll do a little bit of the math here.
[240:48.12]Hold on a second.
[240:49.32]We got you at 99.
[240:50.00]You're way too kind, chat.
[240:52.64]Thank you.
[240:53.00]Got you 90 for complexity.
[240:54.26]We got you at 100.
[240:55.60]Is it silly to ask, is there a difference in chat's grade if it's unanimous?
[240:59.31]Does that make it 100?
[240:59.87]Or is it a 95 max?
[241:02.09]It's just 95 max.
[241:02.87]Okay.
[241:03.87]Just to make it sort of point-wise, it was easier to calculate.
[241:06.71]Nobody is going to get a 100.
[241:08.19]Like, it's impossible, right?
[241:09.61]Okay.
[241:09.95]It's impossible.
[241:10.55]Great, great, great.
[241:10.97]Yeah, impossible to get a 100.
[241:11.85]Makes sense why they get it.
[241:12.94]Makes sense why they get it.
[241:15.73]well among a few other reasons but uh I'll get you at a drum roll please ladies and gentlemen rt game is currently at the head of the class with a 96.65 one tenth of a point higher than his Alex oh my god and five tenths of a point higher than doug doug
[241:41.55]How freaking dare you?
[241:43.09]That is- I don't want to be a buzzkill, but Dougnyland does own the rights to Barbie and we will be sending you a cease and desist.
[241:49.14]Oh, that's true.
[241:51.20]That's true.
[241:52.04]Look, the two people who might beat me, Etalyx and the Barbie house, both cheating the law legally.
[241:59.79]Listen, there can be a brand opportunity here, right?
[242:02.99]Mattel is very powerful, as I imagine Dugneyland is.
[242:06.12]Our lawyers will talk, right?
[242:07.64]We can work something out here.
[242:09.24]Can you give me a little cut of the $10,000 prize pool that Jerma put up?
[242:14.22]We can agree to that, yeah.
[242:17.52]It was actually $100,000, but I mean, I don't know why you said it was so low.
[242:23.12]But I am okay with this being the model house that Jerma recreates from scratch rather than Dugneyland.
[242:29.27]$100,000 prize pool.
[242:31.41]Oh, no, no, no.
[242:33.03]Alright.
[242:33.63]That was fucking phenomenal, RT.
[242:36.11]Thank you very much.
[242:37.13]You're way too kind.
[242:37.95]Thank you, everyone.
[242:38.83]It's unbelievably kind of you.
[242:40.57]It was really good, RT.
[242:42.38]Good show.
[242:42.90]Thank you so much.
[242:43.80]Everybody did a great job.
[242:45.02]Come on.
[242:45.44]Like, with people's skill levels in the game, and some people woke up an hour before, and some people with timings trying to get... This was a lot of fun.
[242:53.60]Thanks, everybody, so much.
[242:54.59]We got one more.
[242:56.09]We've got Conrad's Pants' House.
[243:00.98]I had a theme or something I went for here.
[243:05.34]Let me know if the stream looks good or if I need to change anything.
[243:08.36]Yeah, let me just turn you up a little.
[243:10.84]Let me take a look.
[243:13.44]I think you should be good.
[243:14.84]Let me check it while I load it.
[243:20.11]I am loading your stream, but it is freezing.
[243:23.77]Let me retry.
[243:27.83]Okay, there we go.
[243:28.55]I can see it.
[243:30.07]You look pretty good on my end.
[243:31.74]I think, let me get rid of these grades for RT.
[243:35.76]I'll tell you when you can go.
[243:37.16]So you said you have a theme that you're going through, you said.
[243:39.26]I have a theme.
[243:40.42]It's not exactly like a home that you, well, I guess you do live in it.
[243:44.36]If you're like, I guess someone who's invited to it, but it's not like a family home.
[243:48.05]It's an orphanage.
[243:53.69]Okay, it's specifically it's 100 Thieves Cash App Orphanage is what we've made here.
[243:59.65]And if you're wondering about the windows, the boards are supposed to be there.
[244:02.49]Okay.
[244:04.15]They're supposed to be there so that you know, people don't leave.
[244:07.79]But yeah, so that those are there for a reason.
[244:10.21]But I can show you the home check it out in the front yard.
[244:13.01]Again, it's an orphanage.
[244:13.91]So you can't really expect it to always like look so great outside.
[244:18.12]uh there was some digging there some digging that didn't get done there you can listen we'll get to it we'll get to it anyways okay and the boards are uh you're you're out of 75 for clinton boards are there for a reason okay so here we walk in and this is the main room as you can see it's a red we have a couch Connor we made the same house and I was just sitting there chatting to people
[244:42.48]Oh, yeah?
[244:43.04]Yeah, I could show you my house that I made.
[244:45.16]Okay.
[244:45.74]Well, I have a light switch.
[244:47.98]That's actually fucking hilarious.
[244:50.22]Alright, go on, go on.
[244:51.14]I don't want to interrupt you.
[244:52.54]Your lights work.
[244:53.10]Your lights actually are functioning.
[244:54.12]They work.
[244:55.32]They work.
[244:55.80]They work.
[244:56.26]So that's one light.
[244:57.30]This is the girls' room.
[244:58.82]Okay.
[245:00.43]This is the girls' room.
[245:01.83]We can fit two.
[245:03.93]We have things girls like in here, like a Barbie dream house.
[245:09.05]Love, Asan, this doll, and Taylor Swift.
[245:14.31]Okay.
[245:16.05]So, yeah, the girls love it.
[245:18.90]Next room over, this is the boys' room.
[245:23.22]We have things boys like, like the main characters in Michael Bay Transformers movies, like Shia LaBeouf.
[245:30.03]And Mark Wahlberg.
[245:30.93]Oh, and Camaro because like Bumblebee.
[245:36.71]So nothing else besides like nothing else besides Transformers.
[245:41.22]No.
[245:41.54]Well, there's Austin's show, but he's not on 100 Thieves anymore, so they had to mark him out.
[245:45.86]Oh, okay.
[245:46.06]But he used to be on the wall.
[245:47.48]Okay, I see.
[245:48.62]Yeah.
[245:49.54]And that's just like a window.
[245:50.60]I don't know if it's a scratch.
[245:52.96]Is it a window or is it a pick?
[245:54.70]Can you get closer for us?
[245:55.80]It's a window.
[245:56.78]I don't know how to crouch.
[245:57.80]Can you crouch?
[245:59.74]I don't think you can.
[246:01.26]Okay.
[246:01.78]Actually, the kid might have actually put that on the wall next to him to simulate.
[246:06.92]Oh, I see.
[246:07.42]Okay.
[246:08.58]Yeah.
[246:10.01]Anyways, that was the boys' room.
[246:11.81]Nice.
[246:12.75]This was an accident.
[246:13.89]There's supposed to be like a door here.
[246:16.09]Fortunately, we won't get into that.
[246:17.61]This is the 100 Thieves Cash App Kitchen Juvie.
[246:20.71]We have brought to you by Courage JD.
[246:23.23]We have Courage on the wall.
[246:24.31]We have a nice sink.
[246:29.03]This is where you get the Juvie.
[246:32.92]I'm going to get... Okay, for creativity, I mean, you may... I'm going to give you... So far, I got you at an 80.
[246:38.74]Okay, I got you ready so far.
[246:40.46]Well, we'll keep getting that up.
[246:42.00]Don't worry Okay, this is the back door here is the repurposed from a Sears that shut down We kind of just took the glass sliding door like the blue Yeah, so that's that we could go I don't know where we could go now we could go upstairs next oh
[246:57.95]Yeah, I'd like to see the upstairs.
[246:59.33]That would be good.
[247:00.75]Again, it's it's tough to get funding for an orphanage.
[247:03.43]So they have kind of make make what's going on with the window hole.
[247:06.41]Is there a window?
[247:06.99]You got a window here on next to the door?
[247:09.95]To the right?
[247:11.03]Yeah, no, like this one?
[247:12.29]Yeah.
[247:13.39]Is that part of another window?
[247:14.83]Or is that just half natural lighting?
[247:17.72]natural lighting?
[247:18.34]Well, the sun is the sun is due south.
[247:20.08]So it's not hitting you this way.
[247:21.82]Well, at this time of day, of course, but yeah, I mean, hold on, give me a minute.
[247:28.51]There's a sleep button.
[247:29.87]Oh, you can't sleep at this one, actually.
[247:31.27]Alright.
[247:33.84]So what do you got?
[247:35.54]Oh, you are the first person to use the house.
[247:39.46]Yeah, I think that's worth at least a couple of points in philosophy.
[247:42.54]And the sun's there somewhere.
[247:44.54]Anyways, upstairs we have, we have a couple different usages.
[247:48.91]The main usage of upstairs is the playroom.
[247:50.83]You'll see it in the corner, but kind of just having like the owner's bed is right there.
[247:56.17]Okay.
[247:56.87]And we want to keep it like motivating for the kids.
[247:59.03]So like we have Ted Lasso on the wall.
[248:00.63]Kids love Ted Lasso.
[248:02.95]This is the bath.
[248:04.20]I see that with E to do something.
[248:11.84]Yeah, well, it's where you... It says called up, but that's where the kid... That's... Oh, okay.
[248:15.52]I see.
[248:15.94]Okay.
[248:16.84]Okay, so... This is a toy.
[248:18.37]Is there any... Is there a bathroom?
[248:23.43]What?
[248:23.69]Right here.
[248:24.81]So that's a... Wait, so that's a bathroom... There's no toilet?
[248:29.37]This is the... It's what they use... Well, I... Okay.
[248:32.58]Did you not even look in the room?
[248:33.74]I... Dude.
[248:36.82]You have...
[248:39.63]Oh, okay, that's right.
[248:40.93]Alright, alright, alright.
[248:42.53]I see, I see, I see.
[248:44.14]We're not trying to kill the kids.
[248:45.54]Okay, alright.
[248:46.68]So now, what's in that room?
[248:49.22]Yeah, anyways, this is like where whoever runs the house would sleep, I guess, like Nadeshot or somebody.
[248:55.85]This is the playroom.
[248:58.29]Now, I know this looks bad, but kids will be kids.
[249:01.43]Boys will be boys.
[249:02.61]Sometimes things get roughed up.
[249:04.56]Okay, we're at it.
[249:07.40]Your score is unfortunately falling after that.
[249:11.66]It's unfortunately falling.
[249:14.86]It's a lot of dings.
[249:17.99]If the kids are happy, then I'm happy, and that's what matters.
[249:20.59]I don't even need the score.
[249:21.91]Anyways, this is the playroom.
[249:23.17]We have a lot of toys for the kids here.
[249:24.59]Okay.
[249:26.21]Wait, you can actually hold them?
[249:28.87]Yeah, you throw it, and they fetch it, and then they come back.
[249:34.05]This is like a little doll, I believe.
[249:36.53]There's some weaponry.
[249:39.20]There's some security cameras.
[249:44.02]We have sponsors.
[249:45.40]Can I see the garage?
[249:48.42]Could I see the garage and the interior of the garage?
[249:51.52]Here we have another toy.
[249:52.62]We have an outlet with a fork.
[249:56.76]Jesus Christ.
[249:58.44]Okay.
[250:01.43]I think your philosophy had to come down a little.
[250:04.89]Of course, you have the garage.
[250:07.57]We'll get there.
[250:08.34]Okay.
[250:09.00]I wanted to show you this.
[250:09.94]We do, like, this is still here.
[250:12.70]Why is it not clean?
[250:14.42]Well, when the kids turn 14, that's where they go drink.
[250:20.27]Juvie.
[250:21.23]Okay, what's in the garage?
[250:22.15]I gotta see the garage.
[250:23.71]Oh yeah, the garage.
[250:25.39]This is where we get streaming set up.
[250:26.91]So if they're going to be in the orphanage, they want to become streamers, obviously.
[250:30.01]And is there anything in the garage?
[250:32.03]Of course.
[250:34.73]Oh, shit.
[250:37.01]Okay.
[250:40.04]You've actually got a garage.
[250:41.38]You have a garage setup.
[250:43.30]That's shocking.
[250:44.38]We have face cams.
[250:47.52]Those are nice face cams.
[250:49.42]The perfect place to see somebody's face.
[250:52.45]She's on 100 Thieves.
[250:55.33]Congratulations for making a garage, first of all.
[250:57.55]Thank you, of course.
[250:59.09]Why would you not utilize the garage?
[251:01.71]What's the computer?
[251:03.43]Is that just a regular computer?
[251:04.75]That's a streaming computer?
[251:06.27]They're Melee players.
[251:07.77]Cool, okay.
[251:10.47]Alright, I think I've got your... Wait, hold on.
[251:12.75]What's in the back?
[251:13.85]You did paint the exterior, which is actually a huge deal.
[251:16.63]Of course.
[251:17.07]Painting the exterior is a big deal.
[251:19.62]So, we're going to have chat get the grade up for you.
[251:21.62]They can do it.
[251:22.38]I can give you what I... Let's not pretend like there's not an effort made on the lawn, because as you can see the turf here, the kids lay it out, they mow it, they try.
[251:30.58]So, you didn't do that?
[251:32.56]No, the kids do it.
[251:33.62]Oh, okay.
[251:34.02]So you didn't do that.
[251:35.22]I'm going to bring the points down.
[251:37.48]It's a part of the... Okay, yeah, that's fair.
[251:43.00]Alright, what have we got for our chat score?
[251:46.14]A, B, C, or D?
[251:47.58]You can't go lower than a 60.
[251:48.56]I'm not saying that for any particular reasons or anything.
[251:52.22]I just wanted to make sure I said it.
[251:55.61]Alright, I got you 75 for creativity.
[251:59.85]I think it's a solid C. I do like the idea.
[252:02.39]What gets a 75 for creativity?
[252:03.51]What did the maze get?
[252:03.97]You're talking about Connor's maze?
[252:12.81]Yeah, just so I have a comparison.
[252:16.34]Connor's Maze got also a 75 for creativity.
[252:22.62]I would like you to open the front door.
[252:25.53]The reason why the 75 is for creativity is because this space, although clean and although nicely decorated...
[252:33.01]The creativity, there's a kitchen there in the way the kitchen's supposed to be.
[252:37.58]It's a nice home.
[252:38.68]It's a nice house you made.
[252:39.68]It's a nice interior.
[252:40.90]I love the idea that you've replicated this home, this house.
[252:45.52]I believe that's a good, but creatively speaking, I think I could have used a little bit more paint on the walls, maybe not so much red.
[252:53.94]And I would say that 75 is a pretty fair score for creativity.
[252:58.48]On complexity, it's not bad.
[252:59.84]Can I chime in?
[253:01.24]I would like to vouch for my
[253:02.96]for my comrade here and give him a couple more on creativity, because, I mean, that is a Courage JD-sponsored kitchen, you know?
[253:09.25]Avengers Assembles, if you know, you know.
[253:12.29]It's an in thing.
[253:13.23]You may not know it.
[253:14.41]Yeah, I think I'm not that familiar with 100 Thieves.
[253:17.79]Come on now, let's not be too hasty with this.
[253:20.14]Sponsorships, you know?
[253:21.04]I mean, there's no hashtag ad anywhere.
[253:23.20]I don't know...
[253:25.24]Whatever puts food on the table for the kids is what I always say.
[253:29.22]I'll give you a 76.
[253:34.35]Complexity, I'm going to give you a 64 for complexity because your favorite operating system is the Nintendo 64.
[253:43.21]I figured that that was a good thing to give you.
[253:44.91]I think that was your favorite concept.
[253:45.83]You called it an operating system?
[253:47.82]Operating system, yeah.
[253:49.48]No, that's my favorite probably.
[253:50.80]That is probably right.
[253:52.00]I gave you a 60.
[253:54.20]Unfortunately, I gave you a 60 for cleanliness.
[253:56.92]Just because it's... All the boards and... That's fair.
[254:01.15]Boys will be boys.
[254:02.39]A lot of the... A lot of the walls were kind of missing pieces.
[254:06.55]There's still that notice on the front.
[254:08.76]It wasn't really cleaned up properly.
[254:10.42]Uh...
[254:11.66]It really shows the state of our orphanages, really.
[254:15.08]I mean, it's not really... That makes sense.
[254:17.39]That's fair.
[254:17.95]I mean, I'm glad I can bring awareness to it.
[254:20.09]Chat has given you a B. Chat has given you an 85.
[254:21.99]Chat's grade is an 85.
[254:23.45]I'll take B.
[254:27.00]I got you.
[254:27.44]I'm going to give you a 78 on philosophy.
[254:30.30]Because I think I like the... Thank you.
[254:33.62]You fulfilled your philosophy.
[254:35.10]The whole place was built on this one theme.
[254:38.12]You didn't make, you know, whatever the hundred thieves, you know, front door and then have a completely different interior.
[254:43.22]You did stick with the theme and the philosophy.
[254:45.14]So I'm going to give you a C plus for that one.
[254:47.38]And we can get you...
[254:58.54]I have to give you your final grade now.
[255:00.56]Your grade is as of right now you got a 76 for creativity.
[255:05.80]I've got you at a 64 for complexity and structure.
[255:10.88]I've got you at 60.
[255:11.84]I'm gonna give you 64 for cleanliness because it's also you know, might as well because it's 64.
[255:17.26]That's fair.
[255:22.36]That makes sense.
[255:23.26]I'm going to give you 78 for philosophy and then an 85 for chat's grade, which gets you to a grand total of 72.4.
[255:31.40]You got a, that's a full on C. That's passing.
[255:35.80]That is more than passing.
[255:37.06]That's very well.
[255:37.78]Is that higher or lower than the other Connor?
[255:40.64]The other Connor got a 75.6.
[255:41.30]Robbed.
[255:41.50]That's fine.
[255:41.90]That's okay.
[255:49.32]I'm a winner in my heart.
[255:50.69]We're last place together.
[255:51.73]We're last place.
[255:52.55]There is no last.
[255:53.65]Okay.
[255:54.25]I just.
[255:54.93]Very important.
[255:55.65]Very important.
[255:56.43]When you're in school, in high school and in college, they don't like bring everybody up and say, alright, Hey, this is the best people in the class.
[256:03.43]Actually they do.
[256:03.91]It's like the fucking Dean's list.
[256:05.09]They do.
[256:05.37]Right.
[256:06.07]They do do that.
[256:06.71]Yeah.
[256:07.07]But they also used to say like 10 people got D's five people got C's and they would say in front of the whole class and then they'd slap a paper in front.
[256:14.42]It was actually traumatizing.
[256:16.30]Hmm.
[256:18.04]This is kind of like that Jerma, in a way you've done this to us.
[256:20.04]How about you show us your house, Jerma? What do you have to offer?
[256:25.04]I was walking around just putting random paint on walls, I was answering technical support questions.
[256:28.04]We all had the same amount of time and you made a house and you've played this game more than us like what's- what's- what's your house what makes it amazing?
[256:34.04]You can grade my house.
[256:35.04]What's the philosophy?
[256:36.04]You can grade my house, that's fine.
[256:39.04]Let me get- let me give the grade- let me give the final grades out,
[256:43.38]We need to know what your qualifications are.
[256:45.40]My qualifications... Oh, yeah, I didn't even get... Yeah, ConnorEatsPants, your overall grade was a 72.4.
[256:51.46]Let's get the final grades on here, because people need to see them.
[256:56.91]And we're going to do it in order of top of the class, down.
[257:01.95]Now, if you got... There's no bottom of the... This is cruel, but how else do we do this?
[257:08.01]How do we do this without it being cruel?
[257:10.04]I bet you feel big.
[257:10.82]I bet you feel big doing this.
[257:11.98]Yeah, go ahead.
[257:12.36]Exact opposite...
[257:14.01]Alright, here we go.
[257:16.05]With a 96.65 RT game is your is your head of the class.
[257:27.55]Honestly, in shock.
[257:28.65]Thank you so much deserved.
[257:31.04]It was great.
[257:31.90]It looked like I was gonna complain, but it looks so good.
[257:34.80]Thank you.
[257:35.50]Thank you.
[257:35.94]I was honestly, I'm still gonna complain a second.
[257:38.26]I'm just kidding.
[257:40.42]Let's get this a little bigger.
[257:41.30]So you can see.
[257:44.69]Alright.
[257:47.67]At 96.55 is Etalyx.
[257:54.47]I think we should just round up.
[257:55.69]Congrats.
[257:56.62]Massive congrats.
[257:57.60]Yours is so cool.
[258:00.32]Just round them both up to 97, you know?
[258:03.04]This is also an A. You remember when teachers wouldn't round up?
[258:07.38]Well, I mean, we could round up, but these are the exact scores.
[258:11.70]With 96.05, we have Doug Doug.
[258:20.23]Clap, clap.
[258:23.49]So those are your top scores.
[258:26.53]That's everybody that got an A, effectively.
[258:29.13]So the people that got into high B, let me just write it, 96.05.
[258:38.37]Alright, the high Bs.
[258:40.01]Let me see.
[258:41.15]Make sure you do your garages next time.
[258:42.57]Can you still see me?
[258:44.87]You're still on screen.
[258:46.57]I was just playing to myself.
[258:47.93]Alright, let me see.
[258:48.41]Who had 87.6?
[258:48.81]87.5?
[258:49.01]Okay.
[258:49.13]With an 87.65, we have Joel.
[258:50.87]Not last!
[258:51.55]Congrats.
[258:52.03]Very good score.
[258:52.86]Very excellent score.
[259:07.98]That's cool.
[259:09.60]That's a B+, isn't it?
[259:10.52]87?
[259:12.07]Yep.
[259:13.61]87 and above, B+.
[259:14.33]That's correct.
[259:16.33]With 87.5.
[259:18.63]We have Poke.
[259:24.62]Poke, 87.5.
[259:26.42]You guys were neck and neck.
[259:28.14]Yours was fucking hilarious.
[259:29.56]Poke's was great.
[259:31.84]Thank you.
[259:33.43]Wait, can I take that 1% he gave me or no?
[259:35.59]Oh, that's right.
[259:36.17]Hold on.
[259:36.45]Wait, wait, wait.
[259:37.69]You did offer the friend points.
[259:40.33]How are we going to do that?
[259:43.30]I think he loses one and both gets one, right?
[259:45.44]Joel, what's your assessment here?
[259:49.04]What am I supposed to do?
[259:50.32]Sorry, what?
[259:50.94]You said you wanted to give zero point something points to friend points?
[259:55.29]Okay, how about this?
[259:55.99]How about this?
[259:58.14]I will give as very generous and I just want to say you know thanks- thank you, that I could be part of this.
[260:04.14]I just want to say this. I think Poke gets a 0.5 extra friend point.
[260:11.14]0.5? So that would be no- no change at all.
[260:16.14]That's right.
[260:17.14]Hey I'll take it. I'll take it. Thank you.
[260:21.14]At 87.55.
[260:24.33]In second place, if anyone below me wants to combine our scores to take first place as a tie, I think I'm open to that too.
[260:30.15]I'd like to give all my points to Connor Eats Pants and to help his orphanage.
[260:33.99]Because I believe in helping the youth.
[260:36.83]We're exchanging them now, aren't we?
[260:39.78]look I'm the teacher you can't just give grades to each other just wait till I get it all on paper I'm standing on my chair right now captain my captain I give it to Connor teacher I'd like to give a full letter grade to uh Mike over there like that is how this works
[260:58.12]Alright, here we go.
[260:58.66]Ready?
[260:58.78]Alright, well then keep it rolling.
[261:00.00]Let's keep it rolling.
[261:00.48]Guys, guys, guys, what if we were to raid Jerma's house?
[261:03.28]All of us.
[261:03.74]No, that's what we're doing.
[261:04.72]Yeah, but I didn't even, I wasn't competing.
[261:06.50]I was like literally walking in circles.
[261:08.06]We weren't competing either.
[261:09.62]Did you have 75 minutes to make it?
[261:11.39]I had 75 minutes to explain to chat how this process was going and answering questions.
[261:15.79]How many hours do you have on, you have more hours on this game than all of us combined.
[261:18.69]I have two or three thousand hours in this game.
[261:21.63]I would demolish any of you in a challenge.
[261:24.33]Any of you.
[261:24.71]We'll find out.
[261:25.61]We'll find out when we look at your house right now.
[261:27.09]Any of you.
[261:27.79]So get through these scores.
[261:29.55]We're going to take a look.
[261:30.25]When's House Flipper 2 out, actually?
[261:32.07]Yeah.
[261:33.11]You guys down for round two when House Flipper 2 comes out?
[261:36.12]Yeah, of course.
[261:38.54]I'll be a part of it.
[261:39.40]I'll be in it next time.
[261:41.80]We'll get you competing, let's go.
[261:43.00]Watch me- see me with an a plus see me with- what who grades it then ? We have to get some uh third party.
[261:49.00]You know what I'll- I'll bow out, I'll grade for you guys. I uh-
[261:52.00]You want to grade?
[261:53.00]Yeah more of a- I feel like just my history lessons aren't appreciated so...
[261:57.00]Alright we got-
[261:58.00]We don't want to hear Your ChatGPT history lessons.
[261:59.00]I mean, Ludwig, you're- Ludwig you're-
[262:01.00]A red devil in the white city. I was an English, major what do you want from me?
[262:05.00]You're an English major as well. I forget that sometimes.
[262:08.00]Yeah I went to college.
[262:10.19]Yeah, English major gang.
[262:11.00]Lud your score- your score is like good you have you had an 83.2. That's a B.
[262:16.00]I know, I had the worst chat vote  though and it really hurt.
[262:19.00]It did, it was 10%.
[262:20.00]They were so mean.
[262:21.00]Yeah they hate you.
[262:24.00]Yeah they hated me.
[262:25.00]The one justice of this entire day is a Ludwig getting a higher score.
[262:27.00]Injustice, you Britt.
[262:30.00]Alright we have-
[262:31.00]Wait did I lose to Ludwig?
[262:35.05]Oh, hold on.
[262:35.71]Hold on.
[262:35.95]Let me see.
[262:36.29]We got 83.2 is Ludwig.
[262:37.91]You had a drinking corner for 14-year-olds.
[262:41.97]That's true.
[262:44.12]That's true.
[262:45.86]You lose quite a few philosophy points with the 14-year-old drinking corner.
[262:50.10]I think that's fair.
[262:51.98]Okay, we got... Yeah, we're the cool orphanage.
[262:54.92]What about Doug's maze room?
[262:57.45]Are we getting more of that one?
[262:59.49]Yeah, Doug did use a... Hey, but Doug's maze room was a real maze.
[263:05.19]It wasn't just walls put up in random locations down gigantic hallways.
[263:09.89]Maze is a generous term to describe what was at the end of that.
[263:15.83]Who's next after Ludwig?
[263:17.35]Alright, now we're down to the Cs.
[263:20.35]We have 78.
[263:22.59]And this is not a bad thing.
[263:24.45]We got 70.
[263:24.97]No, it's not.
[263:26.19]It's not.
[263:26.87]Criken, we got you at a 78.45.
[263:30.66]That's a C+.
[263:32.26]That's good.
[263:32.66]And C's get degrees.
[263:33.88]C's get degrees.
[263:34.90]Real shit.
[263:35.51]And remember, philosophy-wise, we saw what happened when somebody went full-blown Barbie house.
[263:41.27]Oh, yeah.
[263:41.55]They won.
[263:41.91]That's true.
[263:43.63]I mean, your philosophy, you were there.
[263:46.28]And I blew it.
[263:47.10]Nice, guys.
[263:49.37]You were there.
[263:50.63]I was there.
[263:51.07]Oh, no.
[263:51.39]Vinny is higher.
[263:52.60]Vinny is higher.
[263:54.14]He's down here.
[263:55.54]Vinny was... Vinny's at 83.8.
[263:59.44]So he is higher than you, Ludwig.
[264:00.62]I'm sorry.
[264:01.68]Oh.
[264:04.66]Yeah, he's got an A. Vinny's really good.
[264:06.43]It was.
[264:06.75]Yeah, Vinny's was really good.
[264:08.98]Yeah, both of ours were good.
[264:09.84]We're both celebrating sports.
[264:11.04]Yeah.
[264:12.60]So now we've got underneath you, Criken, we have with a 75.6, we have CDawg.
[264:22.34]Thank you.
[264:23.96]This was awesome.
[264:27.06]It was like a PowerPoint presentation of like memes.
[264:30.84]It really was.
[264:32.97]Honestly, it was just you went through your computer and just typed in.
[264:35.97]You typed into the Windows search bar dot PNG.
[264:39.87]And was just like, what do I got on my computer right now?
[264:42.45]Your house is what Elon Musk wanted to live in when he bought Twitter.
[264:45.80]Just memes.
[264:46.64]Just comedy was legal again.
[264:47.88]I, you know, I think I went the extra mile with the decoration and the sheer amount of walls.
[264:54.35]It was just...
[264:54.81]It was tough.
[264:55.37]It was a lot of walls.
[264:56.91]It was a lot of walls.
[265:01.19]Too much walls.
[265:02.73]By the time I realized I had 10 minutes left, I was like, oh, I've got nothing.
[265:07.30]They were all mustard colored too.
[265:08.96]You had like a whole mustard colored house.
[265:12.18]I loved it.
[265:12.92]I loved it.
[265:13.56]I imagine in summer, it's just unbearably hot because the air can't reach you.
[265:18.54]Oh my God.
[265:20.46]There's no reason to be there anyway, let alone any season.
[265:23.12]There's no reason to be there.
[265:24.92]There's no reason to be in the house.
[265:27.54]It's on the real estate listing.
[265:29.16]There's no reason to be there.
[265:30.90]And then a 72.4, which is a 72 a C still?
[265:34.06]It is, right?
[265:34.88]Or is it C minus?
[265:36.94]C minus.
[265:37.39]That's Conrad's Pants at a 72.4.
[265:47.57]All the C's got C's.
[265:48.97]That's kind of thematic.
[265:51.39]There are your final grades.
[265:53.17]That's a 1.667 GPA, right?
[265:54.99]Did I literally get last place?
[265:59.15]Oh, yeah.
[265:59.43]You got dead last.
[266:00.63]There is no last place.
[266:02.48]There is no last place.
[266:03.50]There is objectively last place.
[266:06.42]There is no last place.
[266:09.03]I think it's fucked up that both the corners were voted last.
[266:11.43]I feel like there's an agenda there.
[266:12.67]There is something there.
[266:13.67]In fact, everybody with C to start their name off, hmm, all got C's.
[266:18.27]Wow.
[266:18.61]What's up with that?
[266:19.67]Huh?
[266:20.37]What about the curve?
[266:21.15]Hey, you guys had your philosophy scores were high.
[266:23.77]Okay, so the actual curve.
[266:24.67]Some would say we never stood a chance.
[266:26.47]Philosophy scores?
[266:28.17]Your philosophy scores were high.
[266:29.31]Jeremiah, put your dog in the game.
[266:31.55]Jeremiah, show us your house.
[266:34.05]Give me a second, man.
[266:35.34]It would be nice to see your house.
[266:36.66]I want you to boot up and show us your house and show us what you made.
[266:39.70]Okay.
[266:41.34]I'll show you my house.
[266:42.58]Alright, I'll show it to you.
[266:45.52]Boot it up.
[266:49.28]I wasn't competing.
[266:51.58]Well, we're still going to judge you on a few factors.
[266:54.11]Guys, what are you thinking for the factors we should judge him on?
[266:56.51]What factors do you want to judge him on?
[266:58.05]No, it's the same criteria.
[266:59.71]I think that's only fair.
[267:01.11]Okay.
[267:01.99]Okay.
[267:02.75]Okay, sure.
[267:03.77]Rate this one.
[267:05.07]Let's see what you guys think.
[267:06.69]Punks, I'm actually going to show you something fucking... Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[267:11.52]We're going to get... I want a real grade, and you better give me a real grade.
[267:14.58]It's going to be one of the pre-built ones.
[267:18.44]Yeah.
[267:20.19]Alright.
[267:20.49]Are you guys ready?
[267:22.29]I'm ready.
[267:24.77]Uh, have you shared your screen yet?
[267:26.47]Oh, just, uh, you, you, you can see, you can see my house.
[267:30.97]You pull up my live stream right now.
[267:32.93]Oh, hang on.
[267:34.23]Give us one sec.
[267:35.11]Hang on.
[267:35.67]And I want you to take a quick look.
[267:37.52]I want you to take a quick look.
[267:38.38]What's your channel name?
[267:39.04]Thank you.
[267:39.32]Not that one.
[267:46.07]Okay, I see the stream.
[267:49.89]Okay.
[267:50.86]I think you got the wrong save.
[267:53.10]Can we go ahead and see that garage before you head out?
[267:55.18]Where the fuck is my house?
[267:56.20]What are you loading here, Jerma?
[267:57.74]Can you go back to the home, please?
[267:59.15]Where is it?
[268:00.92]What about the garden after building the house?
[268:02.82]Where's the Krusty Krab?
[268:04.48]The Krusty Krab was here.
[268:06.00]Where's the Krusty Krab?
[268:06.84]What?
[268:07.50]Sure, it was.
[268:07.94]Are you okay?
[268:08.56]Jeremiah, what are you talking about?
[268:09.66]Honestly, God, why is the Krusty Krab not here?
[268:12.44]I don't know.
[268:14.64]I swear to God it was here like fucking 40 minutes ago.
[268:17.37]Okay, alright.
[268:19.47]You got to be shitting me.
[268:20.75]Where's the Krusty Krab?
[268:21.55]We got a zero for preparation.
[268:26.56]Yeah, the fact that this doesn't exist is good doc complexity.
[268:29.70]We are going to add complexity, I think, because he's made it up in his own head.
[268:34.53]No, this is fucked up.
[268:35.91]This is actually fucked up.
[268:36.73]That's more philosophical.
[268:38.69]I sold it.
[268:39.54]Yeah, that is philosophical.
[268:40.94]I sold it.
[268:42.94]It's the cabin?
[268:44.64]No, it's not.
[268:45.32]It's not.
[268:49.38]It would be the Krusty Krab.
[268:50.42]It wouldn't be the cabin.
[268:52.44]That's a mess right there.
[268:54.10]Yeah, that's fucking awful.
[268:55.70]That's not looking good.
[268:57.36]60 for cleanliness, right guys?
[268:58.56]That is the lowest score, of course.
[268:59.58]That is the lowest possible score, yeah.
[269:01.79]There's a bin bag clipped into the window.
[269:02.89]Hold on, Jerma.
[269:03.29]You should.
[269:03.51]Oh, did you just have a 180 in your opinions?
[269:05.29]I think you just did.
[269:12.64]Oh, it just got silent.
[269:14.10]Wait, wait.
[269:14.44]This is the wrong building.
[269:15.52]Am I wrong to say that?
[269:16.62]Why don't we take you through?
[269:17.86]What's this?
[269:18.36]Holy shit.
[269:29.20]Let's stop interrupting.
[269:30.04]Go ahead, Jeremiah.
[269:30.60]Build a way.
[269:30.98]Build a way.
[269:31.24]This Krusty Krab.
[269:32.30]That looks pretty interesting, doesn't it?
[269:33.66]Through the front door.
[269:34.42]As you see, this house is perfectly... This sign is in the perfect location.
[269:37.56]Going through here, we've got the Galley Grub.
[269:40.96]There is your ordering station.
[269:43.35]Squidward sits right here.
[269:44.95]Unbelievably complex.
[269:46.17]Complexity, philosophy, theming.
[269:47.85]Idea of the bathtub being the thing that he sits behind.
[269:50.11]How's that?
[269:52.25]Don't worry about this.
[269:53.19]This is... Don't have to worry about that.
[269:57.09]This is... Hold on.
[270:00.76]Why is there a futuristic space?
[270:02.22]Just wait, just wait, just wait.
[270:03.98]Go look at what the Krusty Krab looks like.
[270:05.52]It looks like this.
[270:06.20]No, it is pretty accurate to the Krusty Krab.
[270:11.12]I'll give you that.
[270:12.54]Oh, Krusty Krab.
[270:13.56]This is where SpongeBob, this is the window.
[270:15.24]The kitchen's pretty good.
[270:18.87]What's that?
[270:19.45]Connor, say that again louder.
[270:20.40]The kitchen's pretty good.
[270:21.68]I don't know, Connor.
[270:22.30]I'm not seeing any mazes.
[270:24.22]Where did the kids sleep?
[270:25.52]Where did the orphans go?
[270:26.62]Yeah, where's the... What about that weird corner?
[270:32.56]Yeah, the weird corner.
[270:34.13]Yeah, no, this is the streamer that gave me an ad.
[270:36.21]Oh, did you have working lights?
[270:37.55]Only three of you did.
[270:39.05]Can you show us the... Could you show us Mr. Krabs' room again?
[270:43.60]This is the bathroom?
[270:45.44]We don't need... I said... I got tired when I did this.
[270:49.71]And I was like, I have to go.
[270:51.67]But it's always hard to make Krusty Krab's office.
[270:54.25]It was hard to do it.
[270:55.05]You forgot the freezer.
[270:56.51]Yeah, it's alright.
[271:00.27]That side door always be in the kitchen.
[271:01.93]I don't remember that in the manga.
[271:03.05]I'll be honest with you.
[271:04.48]This is up here.
[271:05.78]If you didn't know, up in the... What is up here?
[271:07.56]Oh, what?
[271:09.50]What?
[271:12.53]How did you remove the stairs?
[271:13.73]What the fuck is this?
[271:16.01]This is a different base home.
[271:18.43]Oh.
[271:19.25]Yeah, some of the houses you can remove the stairs.
[271:20.97]Some of them were made way more customizable than others.
[271:22.77]Unfinished upstairs?
[271:23.63]That's a minor point.
[271:24.65]This is when Mr. Krabs goes into hiding and the IRS is after him.
[271:29.07]And this was... You made this in 45 minutes?
[271:31.41]Somebody hacked my computer and did this part.
[271:33.71]Jerma's house looks like a Gmod map on TTT.
[271:36.47]Can you go through those doors?
[271:37.77]Wait, what?
[271:38.69]What is going on in here?
[271:40.15]Somebody hacked my computer into this.
[271:42.69]Oh, vampires.
[271:45.56]And yes, I did this in 45 minutes.
[271:49.74]Can you show us the outside?
[271:51.36]Yes.
[271:51.82]Did you make a vampire shrine to yourself?
[271:54.54]Yeah, fucking weird.
[271:55.94]I know.
[271:56.16]I wish I was a vampire, too.
[271:59.64]What's the idea behind the weeds and the straw?
[272:02.05]Because House Flipper actually grows grass, and I haven't been in this house for, like, four months.
[272:08.23]What's the deal with that balcony on the side of the house?
[272:10.89]Can you look at that again?
[272:11.72]Which one?
[272:13.50]Left side of the Krusty Krab.
[272:15.52]Oh, um...
[272:17.29]So what's going on there?
[272:18.21]I'll figure it out.
[272:19.63]I could figure it out.
[272:20.11]Good question, Doug.
[272:20.99]By the way, where are all the animals?
[272:22.49]Because they were like... Where's the maze?
[272:26.16]Oh, and you didn't even say anything about my... Oh, it's nothing, sir.
[272:28.44]There was like a bunch of problems.
[272:29.30]Can we see the garage, please?
[272:31.12]No maze?
[272:31.66]Okay.
[272:32.99]Where are the animals?
[272:33.61]There were like 15 animals that were like running around.
[272:38.02]Well, they got to make the burger somehow, so.
[272:40.04]Did you remember to feed them?
[272:40.72]Did you plan this whole tournament so you could show us this house?
[272:42.98]Yeah, I think that's it.
[272:45.78]Can you slingshot above that gray thing in the back to see what's back there?
[272:51.52]Okay.
[272:51.90]You want me to just go up and take a look?
[272:54.07]Yeah, yeah, yeah, if you could.
[272:55.49]You got it?
[272:57.53]Oh, you have a grappling hook?
[272:58.85]Yeah, there's a grappling hook.
[273:02.31]Oh, you mean back here?
[273:03.75]Yeah, there's like a trap door or something.
[273:06.17]Oh, that is weird.
[273:06.77]What is that?
[273:13.50]What's going on here?
[273:15.20]That should be illegal.
[273:18.56]I didn't put that there.
[273:19.86]I don't like that.
[273:20.70]I didn't put that there.
[273:23.04]That makes me uncomfortable.
[273:24.24]I don't think I put that there.
[273:25.20]That makes me uncomfortable.
[273:27.04]We're going to take points off our cleanliness.
[273:28.42]It's going to be a plus in complexity, minus in philosophy for sure.
[273:31.62]What's my grade?
[273:33.15]The smell's so bad you have to escape through the hatch.
[273:35.99]I mean, honestly, I thought you guys want to go ahead first?
[273:40.15]What do you guys think for creativity?
[273:41.94]Creativity, it's definitely got to be high.
[273:43.36]It's pretty high.
[273:44.60]I thought at least a 90.
[273:46.06]Yeah, I think that's fair.
[273:49.39]One thing that bothered me is that the sign wasn't on its own post because that, to me, is the defining feature of the Krusty Krab is its own definitive sign.
[273:57.85]He just slapped it on the front like he doesn't have the McDonald's arches.
[274:02.73]Game limitation.
[274:03.76]It's not even transparent.
[274:04.80]It's just a, you know, like a white.
[274:06.56]Yeah, it's just a PNG.
[274:08.34]There's also no nod to the, you know, Plankton's home nearby.
[274:11.78]So it's really geographically vague where we are.
[274:14.42]Yeah.
[274:14.92]That's right.
[274:15.54]You're right.
[274:16.00]Why would it be 90 creativity on like established IP?
[274:21.19]Well, how much time did Jerma have on this house then?
[274:24.69]45 minutes plus about three and a half hours.
[274:27.57]You've clocked in like 65,000 hours.
[274:31.71]I have barely played this game.
[274:33.05]Alright.
[274:33.35]And I'm trying to get extra points here at the end.
[274:35.39]And I'm just saying with the amount of time, you know, from this game, you should have been able to shit out of Mona Lisa in no time.
[274:42.34]But no, Gary, no SpongeBob, no Nosferatu.
[274:46.16]You're not going to make it in Hollywood.
[274:47.62]Nosferatu, excuse me.
[274:49.52]That's a good point.
[274:50.28]No, Nosferatu.
[274:51.60]He did make the whole vampire room.
[274:52.72]He does have a Nosferatu.
[274:53.60]He did actually have a vampire room, in fairness.
[274:56.50]Come on.
[274:58.57]In fact, let's touch on that for a moment.
[275:00.63]I thought because of the vampire room, for me, Philosophy was the highest score.
[275:04.01]I put 95.
[275:04.23]Yeah.
[275:06.84]Now, on philosophy, I don't know, but just because of that hatch to access the toilet, because, like, what if you're just taking a shit and someone, like, climbs down from the ceiling?
[275:14.95]No, yeah, I put 60.
[275:16.09]That's some weird philosophy.
[275:18.31]I don't know why I'm being encouraged.
[275:19.91]I do have work in the house for cleanliness.
[275:21.81]You may be able to take a shit on the roof and have it drop down into the toilet, though.
[275:25.71]nah the angle makes that impossible to be Frank but the detail not with my kind of firepower the detail though go look at the picture no but that's that's not that's that's nothing go look at the interior of the crusty crab that's the problem it doesn't look at the look at look at this wood look at how the wood falls why is there a trough for cows
[275:50.25]They were like 10 barn animals that lived here, and I don't know where they are.
[275:53.53]I don't know where they went.
[275:55.33]They're actually supposed to be here.
[275:56.71]Lost barn animals minus five.
[275:59.86]I think they're dead.
[276:02.26]I don't know what happened to the animals.
[276:05.18]While we're doing the grading, I think the mods are sharing that Chat's vote has come in with an F, unfortunately.
[276:11.69]That's bullshit.
[276:12.47]I didn't think it would deserve an F, but it is the majority of the votes.
[276:17.01]Look at this one.
[276:18.51]it's still time okay so that's 60 that's so let me do okay fine what what creativity what do you got for me creativity I think 90 90 okay yeah yeah it's established IP though right but Barbie house we gave a hike but it's fine that's fine okay it's fine oh okay I got like 70 for 100 thieves orphanage
[276:43.61]complexity I think I think um it was there's some like cool elements like the door the sliding doors um like even like the posters I think are kind of cool but if you open up look at the interior of the crusty crab you wouldn't have put these here ludwig
[277:02.90]The troughs?
[277:03.59]Yeah, I don't think it makes sense.
[277:04.99]No, no, no.
[277:05.57]I'm talking about these pillars with the wood.
[277:07.81]The trapdoor to the bathroom so that perverts can enter?
[277:11.15]Between the... I don't think you would have done this.
[277:13.07]I think you would have just kept the tables as they were.
[277:15.59]You told us specifically just now to look up images of the interior, so I did.
[277:19.98]And they're all rectangular.
[277:21.72]Like, the interior of the Krusty Krab is one big rectangle.
[277:25.96]That's true.
[277:27.48]Let's go with maybe 85 for complexity.
[277:29.96]Fuck!
[277:30.20]Yeah.
[277:31.44]I think, I honestly think that.
[277:33.16]It is quite complex.
[277:35.18]70 for complexity.
[277:37.37]70?
[277:37.63]What?
[277:38.35]I think 70.
[277:38.89]I thought the trapdoor that went up to the room was kind of cool.
[277:44.92]And the memes are nice.
[277:46.40]Until you realize it's just empty space.
[277:49.18]How about an 80?
[277:51.64]How about an 80?
[277:52.56]I can do 80.
[277:54.72]We should divide the score by how much time was spent making the item.
[277:59.30]45 minutes plus 4 hours.
[278:01.46]Well, I think Chad's vote went into account that because they gave him an F. Hold on.
[278:04.46]Yeah, Sergeant Irma, go ahead.
[278:07.94]Okay, yeah, I took longer doing this, but I wasn't timed.
[278:11.29]I sat around.
[278:12.03]We watched like three or four YouTube videos.
[278:15.14]We went off on like a food tangent.
[278:16.92]There was like at least two or three hours of that stream where I wasn't even playing House Flipper.
[278:20.62]Little Baby said what?
[278:22.65]I could repeat it.
[278:23.53]So what happened was I was watching videos.
[278:26.89]I was watching like three or four videos.
[278:28.59]And then we did like a whole nother thing.
[278:30.96]We were talking about food and stuff.
[278:32.58]Did you hear me that time?
[278:34.32]No, I heard you that time loud and clear.
[278:36.36]I think I appreciate that.
[278:38.70]The one thing that we're going to talk about deeply is cleanliness.
[278:43.04]Yeah?
[278:43.72]Yeah.
[278:44.46]And how... It was a trough.
[278:46.08]Yeah, the trough was for the animals that we... I put this in the last 60.
[278:49.84]To me, it's a 60.
[278:52.36]That's right in front of the menu as well.
[278:54.13]What is dirty here?
[278:55.63]Look at how everything is perfectly clean.
[278:58.15]You made a restaurant with a trough inside.
[279:00.37]I can put my hand on the wall.
[279:01.37]Goddamn scores.
[279:02.85]Look at this.
[279:03.75]Even the bathroom.
[279:04.35]The bathroom is immaculate.
[279:05.72]Look at every single one of them.
[279:06.68]And no shits in here.
[279:07.96]No piss buckets in here.
[279:09.48]These are all clean.
[279:10.46]I think it's not clean, though, the fact that you're shitting in an open... You're shitting next to someone.
[279:14.84]There's no... Look, you've got a ventilation system here.
[279:17.63]Ventilation.
[279:19.21]Why are the toilet stalls open?
[279:20.63]Why isn't there any doors on there?
[279:21.93]Yeah, why?
[279:22.29]It's not clean at all.
[279:23.37]Because you can't put them...
[279:25.35]I feel like it might come off biased if someone with a lower score makes this call.
[279:29.39]RT, what do you think for cleanliness?
[279:31.25]Because you had the highest score.
[279:32.67]Again, I'm just trying to think of it in relation to the SpongeBob lore, and the Krusty Krab actually is notoriously not clean, and Mr. Krabs is deploying all kinds of techniques to just keep it vaguely afloat when it's filthy.
[279:46.71]There's even an episode about the actual germs in the establishment, if anything.
[279:51.15]I think the lore should be taken into account in judging that.
[279:54.71]I'm on board with that but there's he just knows the truth the lord didn't apply in the grading though because like mine was a messy orphanage but it was not messy that is true the hundred thieves juvie orphanage would be messy yeah and it also wasn't creative
[280:08.45]Oh, but did you have Fred in your playthrough?
[280:17.88]Let's get a grade.
[280:20.32]Let's get a grade.
[280:22.22]Can our A grades all give us a cleanliness score?
[280:25.92]Whoever got an A, can you give out a score for cleanliness and we'll find an average?
[280:29.78]Zero.
[280:31.26]Connor, you're obviously a C grade.
[280:32.78]Thank you very much.
[280:33.22]He's salty because I gave his maze mustard house a 76.
[280:38.64]uh I'm salty because I got worse than the maize mustard house that's true honestly honestly after tonight after tonight and I'm all this drama in this community and this you know cataclysm that has happened the only reasonable thing I can see happening from now on is if Jeremiah individually goes through every person and pretends they are the winner and congratulant you won first place so we all get validation from this so we can pretend and feel good maybe just a dm that I can screenshot
[281:06.79]I will DM everybody saying, you did a great job, but ain't nothing better than the Krusty Krab.
[281:13.76]That will be in the DM.
[281:16.08]And you can crop it.
[281:16.92]You can crop it.
[281:18.18]You can crop it.
[281:18.62]We can crop that message and frame it on the wall.
[281:20.51]Based on that alone, I'm leaning towards giving you, you know, all the Connors got a C grade.
[281:24.63]I think maybe you deserve a J grade too below that.
[281:28.01]Yeah.
[281:29.63]Alright.
[281:30.71]So what am I getting for complexity?
[281:32.56]For real?
[281:33.94]Uh, complexity was 80.
[281:35.49]Creativity was 90.
[281:36.41]Okay.
[281:37.57]So now philosophy is your highest score.
[281:40.71]Okay.
[281:41.01]So what would you say that is?
[281:44.02]91.
[281:44.82]Are you all agreeing on that?
[281:46.63]No. Did we talk about the alien doors clipping through the wall or no?
[281:50.63]Uh, we didn't.
[281:51.00]Thank you for bringing it up Poke.
[281:52.00]Yeah it's really bothering me and- can you guys show the doors? Like look open the door and look at it clip guys. Like what are we doing here? What are we doing here?
[282:01.00]Go in the bathroom- go in the bathroom and look at the alien door and go up. What is that there? Like look up above the alien like-
[282:07.00]It's a vent- it's for ventilation. It's a ventilation event.
[282:10.00]I don't want to start more drama in the community but like this is really pissing me off.
[282:14.68]It needed to be said.
[282:16.30]I have a monumental point on cleanliness.
[282:17.99]He has a please wash your hands sign.
[282:19.73]There is no sinks in that toilet.
[282:21.19]There's only toilet bowls.
[282:22.52]Where are you going to wash your hands?
[282:24.26]I mean, they're in the water though.
[282:27.04]what about in here we're just coming to you you can come in here like dip your hands in here that the water is here like how do we look look see and and did you have teleportation powers in your house I think that gets at least you didn't even know I had that okay wow bumping up philosophy to 93 for that I didn't even go in the teleporting pool and that's why this is our final call whatever we have for that we can get our grade
[282:55.14]I'm going to say 90.
[282:55.88]90 for me.
[282:56.42]Alright.
[282:56.80]Chad gave me a 60.
[282:57.30]Okay.
[282:59.10]Philosophy and math, whatever.
[283:00.36]You said 90?
[283:01.16]We have our final scores then.
[283:02.98]Okay.
[283:03.22]So what do you want?
[283:03.76]If you can do the calculation.
[283:04.72]Creativity.
[283:05.30]90.
[283:06.34]Okay.
[283:07.20]Complexity.
[283:08.94]80.
[283:09.20]Okay.
[283:09.78]Philosophy.
[283:13.15]93.
[283:13.17]93.
[283:14.37]Cleanliness.
[283:16.69]60.
[283:16.71]90 flat.
[283:17.91]90 flat cleanliness?
[283:19.09]Are you guys agreeing on that?
[283:21.11]That's what Doug said.
[283:22.21]I mean, I'm down to lower it.
[283:23.27]Sure.
[283:24.22]I think it's fair.
[283:24.84]88.
[283:25.08]Go for it.
[283:26.80]88?
[283:26.94]Is that fair?
[283:27.56]I can do 88.
[283:28.34]I can do 88.
[283:29.54]Okay.
[283:30.40]Check rate 60.
[283:31.56]Alright.
[283:31.98]So that puts me at an 84.655.
[283:37.73]Wait.
[283:38.49]Yeah, I disagree.
[283:39.25]It's respectable.
[283:40.41]I fundamentally disagree.
[283:42.05]Let me just sneak my way in here real quick.
[283:44.15]Oh, sorry.
[283:44.89]Dropped your cleanliness to 80 flat.
[283:47.76]80, where am I?
[283:48.36]Sit here?
[283:48.88]Oh, we're right above here.
[283:50.30]This looks great.
[283:51.12]Right above Vinny, right below Poke.
[283:52.72]Honestly, that's pretty fair.
[283:55.30]Middle of the pack.
[283:57.24]84.65.
[283:57.52]That looks alright to me.
[283:59.58]Imagine you're doing an exam and the teacher just takes at the end and is like, I did better than you.
[284:05.73]What about my test?
[284:07.37]Still didn't even do top five.
[284:09.33]That's right.
[284:11.27]The teacher didn't even get top five.
[284:14.94]How the hell did you do it so good?
[284:16.18]Tell me.
[284:17.80]There are your final grades.
[284:19.93]Well, hey, Jerma, you know, congratulations.
[284:22.35]You look like you have some potential in this game, so I would keep at it.
[284:26.50]Yeah.
[284:27.06]That was a lot of fun.
[284:27.82]Did you guys have a good time?
[284:30.58]I don't know how you guys did what you did in 75 minutes.
[284:33.36]You guys are amazing.
[284:34.90]Yeah, everyone was creative for their own way, you know?
[284:37.39]That was awesome.
[284:39.03]I want to do it again.
[284:40.41]My only regret is I didn't get to go earlier, so I wouldn't have to go after the... Yeah, I wish I went earlier, too.
[284:50.52]do this again we do this again but we're given two hours yeah we can do we could do a two hours hey House Flipper two actually they don't have a release date but you can build your you can build your actual whole house I think from scratch in house number two oh my god I also think a strict a strict um
[285:10.35]Like you should be graded on your performance or your presentation.
[285:14.46]Like it should be strict.
[285:16.16]Five minutes.
[285:16.98]Can't go over.
[285:17.62]Can't go under.
[285:18.98]Get some songs in there.
[285:20.06]You know, I think that's part of it.
[285:21.40]Get some songs in there.
[285:22.70]Little music.
[285:26.44]I just realized something.
[285:27.56]I just realized something.
[285:28.70]This whole thing was like gaslight by Jerma because he just took a bunch of people in here to see how they viewed him through a scope.
[285:35.77]Like, how do you view Jerma?
[285:38.09]And it turns out it's, you know, me just viewing him through memes.
[285:42.73]But other people are thinking like, how do I skew it towards Jerma through creativity or whatever?
[285:48.12]You know, and I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I think this was a experiment for Jerma to do it.
[285:54.26]I don't know.
[285:54.80]It just feels like there was something going on here.
[285:57.15]This was an experiment.
[285:59.19]That is absolutely correct.
[286:00.91]None of you won anything.
[286:02.73]And we're all going to go about our day normally.
[286:04.63]100 grand.
[286:07.62]yeah the candy bar I'll be waiting for the check in the mail the candy bar 100 grand scale right here this is some ign scoring for sure you should advertise it like 10 million dollars next time but it's all inside jokes we don't talk about that do it for like five million dollars yeah just yeah
[286:25.82]Well, honestly, this was actually an experiment.
[286:28.06]I hope you guys had a good time.
[286:29.36]I thought it was great.
[286:30.96]Everyone had a lot of funny shit.
[286:33.16]I thank you for organizing this.
[286:36.26]Yeah.
[286:37.24]Thank you so much.
[286:38.85]If I had to lose to one person by 0.1 points, I would be... Oh, my God.
[286:43.29]I'm honestly shocked.
[286:44.63]I'm honestly shocked.
[286:46.29]No, you guys did great.
[286:47.91]Like I said in the very beginning, all these grades, it's just horseshit.
[286:51.18]It's just for fun.
[286:51.82]So I'm glad everybody had a good time.
[286:53.56]I know.
[286:53.80]Don't worry.
[286:54.74]We spent, like, 20 minutes braiding your crusty crab, like, number by number.
[286:59.49]If it doesn't mean anything, I mean, I would have probably given myself, like, a 96.
[287:04.95]Well, thank you very much, Sherman.
[287:05.81]Thank you, everybody.
[287:06.37]Take care, guys.
[287:07.01]It was a pleasure.
[287:07.87]Alright.
[287:12.41]Take it easy, guys.
[287:12.89]Thanks for sticking around.
[287:16.69]Thank you.
[287:17.23]Bye-bye.
[287:17.75]Thanks also to the mods, too.
[287:18.83]The mods helped facilitate a lot of this, so thanks, mods.
[287:25.86]Alright.
[287:28.58]That was really interesting.
[287:30.83]I think I had a lot of fun.
[287:32.67]Hopefully everybody else did.
[287:34.11]Technically speaking, I think it... Yeah, maybe we could drop the amount that people can do a tour.
[287:38.97]Because some people was like eight minutes, then it was like 15, 6, 12.
[287:42.71]I think we could probably make it so it's like you get 12 minutes and that's it.
[287:46.41]But I had a blast.
[287:48.36]That was a lot of fun.
[287:49.60]If you guys liked it, I would love to do another one.
[287:52.10]Get some other streamers too.
[287:53.18]Get some more people involved.
[287:55.99]So just about at like the four and a half, five hour mark right now.
[287:59.37]So I think that's good.
[288:03.42]Sounds good.
[288:05.80]I don't mind having no limits.
[288:08.77]Yeah, I mean, I wanted to give people the room to kind of just kind of go and meme and do whatever they wanted.
[288:14.59]So, but yeah, I mean, the screen sharing was the technical stuff through.
[288:18.81]It looked pretty good.
[288:21.25]The only thing is Joel's looked like kind of that kind of chunky PlayStation 1.
[288:24.84]But the good part is you could watch it on Joel's stream too.
[288:28.16]So that was part of it too, to make sure that you could see a high quality version.
[288:31.16]But it was awesome.
[288:32.26]Joel's was great.
[288:32.96]I loved it.
[288:35.94]Yeah, I would love to do this again.
[288:38.70]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[288:40.32]See you soon.
[288:41.20]That's it for me.
[288:42.02]That's really all I had planned.
[288:44.35]Is anybody else going to stick around and stream?
[288:46.09]That was there.
[288:47.65]If they are, we can throw a raid to them if people are still raiding.
[288:53.42]I mean, if people are still streaming.
[288:58.00]Yeah, that was fun.
[289:00.39]Yeah, thanks everybody that participated.
[289:01.91]I know, uh, kind of taking a, like a four or five hour chunk out of your day, uh, to kind of hang out for a while is, it's a lot to ask, but I appreciate it.
[289:10.15]Everybody that was there.
[289:15.25]Raid the winner.
[289:16.79]That's actually a good idea.
[289:18.42]That's funny.
[289:19.30]Highest grade gets the raid.
[289:21.58]Or should we split it between three people?
[289:25.43]Is, uh, so, um, DougDoug, RT, and Etalyx are the top three.
[289:34.28]RT has, or RT is ending.
[289:36.18]Of the top three, who is not ending?
[289:40.32]You said RT is ending?
[289:42.47]Is DougDoug still streaming?
[289:43.35]Is Etalyx still streaming?
[289:46.81]Because Etalyx technically was in second place.
[289:54.52]You should raid the loser instead.
[289:56.36]No.
[290:00.64]Connor's house was fucking funny.
[290:01.94]It was great.
[290:06.27]Alright, is Italic still planning on streaming?
[290:15.57]As I do this, let me do that.
[290:19.49]Let me put the actual shit up here now.
[290:22.14]Here, there we go.
[290:28.00]Let me ask him, let me see if he's still going.
[290:30.92]Turn this down for just a second.
[290:32.26]I'll hop back in here.
[290:37.08]Uh, Etalyx, are you here?
[290:41.34]He is deafened and muted.
[290:43.47]Etalyx is not streaming anymore?
[290:49.19]Etalyx is ending, alright.
[290:50.17]So, DogDog is the third up, so Etalyx is ending.
[290:54.42]So go say hi to your number three, your top of the class, Doug Doug, with his unbelievable royalty-free Doug Land.
[291:04.78]Have I been summoned?
[291:05.92]Oh, I was saying if you're still streaming.
[291:07.30]You're ending, right?
[291:09.33]Yeah, I'm probably going to take off just because it's been a great five hours, though.
[291:13.43]Yeah.
[291:15.03]Well, thanks, dude.
[291:16.43]I hope you feel better.
[291:18.65]Thank you.
[291:19.45]I had a ton of fun.
[291:21.11]Chat, hopefully you were wowed.
[291:22.73]Thank you for the A. Honestly, he's a great lad.
[291:28.07]Dude, fully, all completely.
[291:31.19]I'm just telling you the way that I see it.
[291:34.43]Your flip the house upside down house deserved to be up there.
[291:37.97]It deserved to be up there.
[291:38.71]It just did.
[291:41.77]I was trying to do something.
[291:43.61]It was a gimmick, but it was a memorable gimmick.
[291:48.35]It was very good.
[291:49.01]I can't do it again.
[291:49.77]That was the only time.
[291:51.27]I gotta find a new gimmick for the next house.
[291:54.29]For House Flipper 2.
[291:55.21]Alright, dude.
[291:57.98]I'll talk to you soon.
[291:58.98]I'm ending now, too.
[292:01.24]Alright.
[292:01.74]Bye, JermaChat.
[292:03.52]See you soon.
[292:06.18]Alright, go all of you.
[292:08.09]Go say hi to DougDoug and congratulate him on being top of the class.
[292:13.70]I will see you guys in about... I'm going to be taking off for a little while.
[292:16.68]I've got some stuff I need to do.
[292:17.54]I've got some work I need to do.
[292:19.02]So you'll see me probably on maybe Sunday or Monday.
[292:22.12]Keep an eye on the sus.
[292:23.22]I'll see you guys in like four or five days.
[292:25.64]Take care.
[292:27.16]Thank you so much for watching.
[292:28.10]This was a pretty wild experiment, but I think it was... I feel like it was a success.
[292:31.79]I think I had a lot of fun.
[292:33.37]Hopefully it was worth watching for you.
[292:35.41]And we'll try to set it up again when House Flipper 2 comes out.
[292:37.91]Maybe get some other streamers in here.
[292:39.43]Maybe more.
[292:41.31]It was a good time.
[292:43.70]Take care of yourselves.
[292:44.36]Have a great night.
[292:46.78]Goodbye.
[292:47.10]Talk to you soon.
[293:34.06]you
