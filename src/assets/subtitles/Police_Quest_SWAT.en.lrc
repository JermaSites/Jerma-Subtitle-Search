[02:35.03]Oh, whatever.
[02:37.55]Alright, let's start it.
[02:38.17]Let's see how far we get with this one.
[02:46.49]And here we go!
[02:51.20]New career.
[02:52.20]Welcome to D, platoon officer.
[02:54.66]Formed in 1967.
[02:55.12]Formed in 1967.
[02:55.76]Oh, SWAT pup.
[02:58.80]I gotta have a name.
[03:04.72]How about... Cadet Carrot.
[03:10.99]That's good.
[03:12.19]Cadet Carrot!
[03:17.01]Welcome to D Platoon, officer.
[03:18.19]I'm Sgt.
[03:18.37]Lopez.
[03:18.49]Hold on, did they just give each other instructions?
[03:20.23]While you're assigned to D Platoon, I'll be your supervisor.
[03:23.40]Your new position here is that of an assaulter.
[03:26.20]This is Officer Packmeyer, and he's your element leader.
[03:29.55]For the record, Officer Packmeyer has been an element leader in Deep Platoon for eight years.
[03:34.68]He's a wealth of information.
[03:36.10]Thank you, Sergeant.
[03:39.34]Hello.
[03:41.32]Officer, I'd like to give some thought to what I'm about to say.
[03:44.89]You are now one of 60 tactical officers within Deep Platoon.
[03:49.39]We constitute less than 1% of the entire Los Angeles police force.
[03:54.42]Your selection and admittance to this platoon is something to be proud of and respected.
[03:58.42]Yeah, why is it so small?
[04:00.04]As a member of SWAT, you are responsible to meet the requirements of specific tactical criteria and will be tested regularly.
[04:07.01]Okay.
[04:07.85]Anytime you should fail to meet these requirements, you will be encouraged to train up.
[04:11.71]Remember, your level of physical fitness, your firearm proficiency, and your understanding of tactics affects the entire team.
[04:19.84]And the team concept...
[04:21.89]Officer, you dare interrupt a superior?
[04:24.37]Let me warn you.
[04:25.85]Insubordination is not tolerated around here.
[04:28.53]Never has been, never will be.
[04:30.57]Is that clear, officer?
[04:32.31]Let me tell you what I'm going to do.
[04:33.85]I'm going to let this pass.
[04:35.41]I'm going to call it a case of first day jitters.
[04:37.89]Don't let it happen again.
[04:39.79]Sergeant Paulin is conducting a training detail later on down Academy range be there Until then learn what you can and work on that attitude of yours.
[04:48.28]Holy shit This is not I I've never been called out for skipping a cutscene before but I just did I Got a fucking smart enough a little bit here.
[04:56.66]You know, I mean Control panel.
[05:01.12]Yeah, that's fine
[05:04.75]Okay, that's just like the menu.
[05:06.55]That's fine.
[05:07.15]Let's just go out here.
[05:08.11]Uh, the police academy.
[05:10.31]Let's go to the sniper range.
[05:12.06]I'm, uh, yeah, I know who you are.
[05:13.76]You're the new guy in Rooker's squad.
[05:15.16]What are you doing out here?
[05:17.42]You guys have small arms training over at the academy.
[05:19.74]Oh, you know, that's right.
[05:20.48]Sergeant Rooker mentioned it.
[05:21.22]Yeah, well, you better get over there.
[05:22.70]I love this green screen technology.
[05:25.13]And it's no coincidence that his nickname is Sergeant Meany.
[05:28.81]Sergeant Meany?
[05:29.61]Yeah, but I wouldn't call him that to his face.
[05:32.09]Thanks.
[05:32.59]Thanks for the advice.
[05:33.41]Yeah, sure.
[05:35.15]I- Okay, don't call him Sergeant Meanie.
[05:38.29]That's all I got from- Alright, give me this.
[05:46.08]Okay, I guess that's what I want.
[05:48.76]Gear.
[05:49.00]Okay, cool.

[21:56.09]We just did this.
[21:57.55]I don't want to do this again.

[22:00.86]Officers, come to your guard.
[22:03.54]Single to the head.

[23:56.83]Thank you.
[23:57.15]We did it.

[24:00.15]Oh.
[24:00.51]Don't even...
[24:20.77]Officers, hold your fire.
[24:22.51]We have a quitter in the group.
[24:23.57]What do you mean?
[24:26.20]That's me leaving.
[24:27.02]What do you want me to tell you?
[24:29.64]What the fuck?

[24:30.80]Now I'm...

[25:11.32]Okay.
[25:12.32]That's it, right?
[25:13.02]I gotta do it again.
[25:41.51]I did it.
[25:42.07]Now I can leave.
[25:42.67]That was fun.
[25:43.03]Thanks.
[25:43.69]Oh my god.
[25:44.13]You wanted interaction.
[25:45.75]Okay, just kill all the bad guys.
[25:51.25]You got it.
[26:18.26]Am I hitting these guys?
[26:20.38]Or am I shooting blanks?
[26:26.06]I'm not loading blanks, am I?
[26:27.48]The Presidente drill is up.
[26:29.51]There are three...
[26:48.50]I put on glasses to leave.
[26:50.44]Okay.
[26:52.12]Here we go.

[26:55.17]Yeah, nice.
[26:55.85]Perfect.
[26:56.91]We'll get started when everyone's here.
[26:58.53]Oh, shit.
[27:00.49]Which would appear to be now.
[27:02.85]Everyone, your attention, please.
[27:04.25]Settle down and we can get started.

[27:36.10]Lucy, if you can hear me, I want you to answer the telephone.
[27:40.90]We're here to help you.
[27:42.48]Please pick up the telephone and talk with me.
[27:45.30]Pick up the phone?
[27:46.88]It's my wife, Lucy.
[27:48.56]Lucy Long.
[27:49.73]She's holding up in the house.
[27:50.97]She won't come out, won't let me in.
[27:53.85]Like I told that other officer, she's been mixed up a lot lately.
[27:57.61]Ain't that so, Katie?
[27:59.11]This is my daughter, Katie.
[28:00.93]Go ahead, hon, you tell the officer.
[28:02.13]That's me.
[28:03.47]My mom's always been real protective of our family, but it's different now.
[28:08.02]It's like she's not just protective.
[28:10.66]She's angry or paranoid or something.
[28:13.08]I don't know what.
[28:13.80]I think she's become dangerous.
[28:16.47]She has a gun now, and she shot at me and my dad this morning.
[28:19.19]That's right.
[28:20.33]She damn near killed us, too.
[28:22.07]See, yesterday, she threw me out of the house, hollering she weren't gonna let me back in.
[28:26.64]She locked all the doors.
[28:28.12]Neighbors across the street were looking.
[28:30.28]So I walked down to Katie's.
[28:32.06]She just lives in the apartments over on Amaroa.
[28:34.84]So I spent the night there.
[28:35.86]This morning, Katie brung me back home.
[28:38.51]We was walking up to the house, and Lucy started shooting at us.
[28:42.23]That's when I called the police.
[28:46.27]Oh, should we go save the game?
[28:47.03]I understand, sir.
[28:47.95]We'd like for your wife to come out on her own so we can get her some help.
[28:51.11]Who's who here?
[28:51.51]If she won't, and the possibility exists she might hurt herself, we might have to go in and get her.
[28:57.16]I was just briefing Mr. Long on a possibility that we might have to enter his home.
[29:01.24]Okay.
[29:01.60]Mr. Long, our crisis negotiation team is currently on the telephone with your wife.
[29:05.68]There's some concern that she may be delusional.
[29:07.98]Now, I realize I've already asked you to explain the physical layout of your house and property, but in case we need to go in and get her, I want to make sure that we're prepared.
[29:15.14]Is there anything else that you can tell me about the house's layout?
[29:18.65]Of course, you've seen the boards in the front windows.
[29:22.33]She's got all the windows boarded up like that.
[29:25.51]Cadet.
[29:26.01]See what you can learn from the Long's neighbors.
[29:28.83]Wait, I gotta go talk to the neighbors first?
[29:31.52]No, but let's just go in the house.
[29:38.22]Control pin.
[29:38.72]I gotta save the game.
[29:40.40]Save mission.
[29:43.49]Save.
[29:44.37]Okay, we're good.
[29:47.19]Excuse me, sir.
[29:48.21]Have you interviewed the Long's neighbors yet?
[29:50.35]If not, I suggest you do so now.
[29:52.55]More information we have, the safer the experience.
[29:54.53]Okay, that'd be huge.
[29:56.26]Uh, then is it, is it, where are the neighbors?
[30:00.13]Hey!
[30:00.99]Hey.
[30:02.10]Since this is your first time out, a little advice for you.
[30:05.26]Do as you're told.
[30:09.34]I get... Where do I have to go?
[30:12.06]Hello, you must be the neighbor.
[30:17.02]Yes, I'm Mr. Devon.
[30:19.26]I've been living across from the lawns for the last ten years.
[30:21.82]This is so fucking loud.
[30:23.06]When I first moved in, they were real nice.
[30:29.05]Showed me and my wife the neighborhood.
[30:31.67]Okay.
[30:33.11]Hadn't been the same in the last few years.
[30:36.38]You know the wife, Lucy?
[30:37.80]Why is the neighbor carrying a broom?
[30:40.46]All day long.
[30:41.66]He's just holding like a broom.
[30:42.88]I'm getting to know you guys on a first name basis.
[30:47.51]Okay, so I talked to the fucking neighbor.
[30:49.37]Cool.
[30:51.97]Excuse me, sir.
[30:52.87]Sergeant Rooker and I'll be calling the briefing in a few minutes.
[30:55.13]Stand by.
[30:56.09]Okay.
[30:56.91]Lash.
[30:58.91]Lash out at fucking somebody.
[31:00.33]Uh, alright.
[31:01.27]Uh, stand by.
[31:03.01]Excuse me, sir.
[31:03.89]Sergeant Rooker and I'll be calling the briefing in a few minutes.
[31:06.17]Stand by.
[31:07.05]Excuse me, sir.
[31:07.95]Sergeant Rooker and I'll be calling the briefing in a few minutes.
[31:10.23]Stand by.
[31:10.67]Okay.
[31:12.65]Excuse me, sir.
[31:13.57]Sergeant Rooker and I'll be calling the briefing in a few minutes.
[31:15.82]Stand by.
[31:16.78]Excuse me, sir.
[31:17.66]Sergeant Rooker and I'll be calling the briefing in a few minutes.
[31:19.92]Stand by.
[31:20.38]Get the fuck out of the way, okay?
[31:21.86]Like, what do I do here?
[31:23.00]Just hang up, okay?
[31:26.57]Anything else?
[31:27.59]Watch my back, and I'll watch yours.
[31:32.22]I love how that is just me.
[31:33.40]Alright, so now I just have to stand here until they call me.
[31:40.14]Hey.
[31:40.36]How you doing, pup?
[31:43.32]How you doing, pup?
[31:43.74]Don't worry about this one.
[31:44.77]Everything's going to be fine.
[31:46.11]I was on the scout with Packmeyer and Rooker.
[31:48.23]There are limited points of entry, and those that are there are pretty well boarded up.
[31:51.21]It just goes from loud to quiet from loud to quiet.
[31:52.35]I think we have a captive audience.
[31:54.20]Okay.
[31:54.31]Here we go.
[31:55.29]First mission.
[32:03.99]And she has a gun.
[32:04.73]Why does it matter if she's diabetic?
[32:06.27]Oh, God.
[32:26.91]This is the layout of the house.
[32:28.65]On side one, we have a front door entrance.
[32:31.29]This is a dangerous approach as it has two windows to contend with.
[32:34.91]The large front window and a small kitchen window.
[32:37.87]To compensate for that, we've placed snipers here.
[32:40.47]On this side of the street, watch those ports.
[32:43.54]Apparently, this house has been somewhat fortified over the years.
[32:46.82]The garage has been sealed off from the house.
[32:50.22]Side three has one opening, a barricaded window.
[32:53.95]Is anything front door?
[32:54.61]Where do I take comment of this?
[32:55.69]Pup and Wixel.
[32:56.61]That's me.
[32:56.89]Any questions?
[32:57.29]No.
[32:57.37]Where's my shotgun?
[33:20.21]Make sure you load silver tip hollow points.
[33:23.09]Silver tip hollow points?
[33:27.85]Are we trying to, like, blow this lady's organs up?
[33:30.25]Like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[33:31.43]This is a soft probe.
[33:33.13]I want stealth movement.
[33:34.45]This changes only if the situation changes.
[33:37.68]Hold on a minute.
[33:41.64]How's that?
[33:41.96]That's probably gonna be better, right?
[33:44.60]So let's go.
[33:50.56]Like, how do we go?
[33:53.00]Did you have an opportunity to speak to the neighbor?
[33:55.56]Yes, he said that Mrs. Long is a little more violent than what her husband would lead us to believe.
[33:59.04]I'm going to drop you even more.
[34:02.55]Alright, let's go.
[34:12.05]Remember, all of you, just because the suspect is a female does not mean she's any less violent than a male.
[34:18.65]Just because she's 64 does not mean she's a sweet old lady.
[34:22.77]Approach this suspect with caution.
[34:25.35]Okay, can we go?
[34:27.43]How do we go?
[34:28.17]Do I need to call even more?
[34:32.65]You and Denton are side three.
[34:34.63]But be aware, there's a lot of foliage back there.
[34:37.38]And you won't have the benefit of sniper coverage.
[34:39.30]Okay, well, let's go.
[34:40.73]Remember, all of you, just because the suspect is a female does not mean she's any less violent than a male.
[34:47.32]Just because she's 64 does not mean she's a sweet old lady.
[34:51.52]Approach this suspect with caution.
[34:53.76]Okay.
[34:55.18]Choose my entry point.
[34:58.26]So I have to go here, right?
[34:59.18]I can't, like, click this.
[35:01.84]I can't, like, move out of the way.
[35:04.68]I can't lash.
[35:07.22]I just click.
[35:07.84]Your lash unit in working order.
[35:10.11]Good.
[35:11.28]Remember, the last unit is not used for lengthy discussions between assaulters.
[35:15.66]It's for keeping the brass informed and any other persons outside your sightlines.
[35:20.46]You understand?
[35:21.56]Yes.
[35:22.22]Good.
[35:23.52]Okay, good.
[35:24.80]Let's go.
[35:25.26]Let's go.
[35:26.08]Let's do it.
[35:26.53]Okay.
[35:37.13]Sounds like the fat's in the fire.
[35:38.85]Line up for deployment.
[35:40.30]Let's go!
[35:45.26]I just heard like a bunch of shots.
[35:48.00]They're just single file?
[35:49.12]Okay.
[35:50.14]That guy has a flail.
[35:51.34]MP5, full auto.
[35:52.16]You got it.
[36:06.23]Why- I'm supposed to be in the back, aren't I?
[36:08.51]Like, going around the back way?
[36:12.57]That guy now has a golf club.
[36:13.83]Wait till I get the fucking driver!
[36:21.44]Aren't I supposed to be going that way?
[36:27.19]How come I don't- Can I not move?
[36:30.27]Get moving.
[36:34.69]How do I move?
[36:36.05]There's no, like, controls.
[36:38.35]What?
[36:42.45]Wait, what?
[36:43.89]What happened?
[36:44.75]Lieutenant?
[36:45.63]What?
[36:46.68]The events of today were tragic.
[36:48.78]Some of your fellow officers were seriously wounded.
[36:51.44]What?
[36:52.52]I ask all of you to consider talking with department counselors to resolve any emotional aftermath you may be suffering due to this experience.
[37:02.72]Hold on.
[37:03.70]Now I can't hear anything.
[37:08.77]An investigation by the Officer Involved Shooting Team, the Use of Force Review Board, the Office of Internal Affairs, and the District Attorney's Office is being conducted relative to what occurred today.
[37:20.25]Until the investigation is completed, I'm suspending Pup of active duty status.
[37:26.36]Pup, this platoon is founded on leadership and obedience.
[37:29.30]We have a saying here.
[37:30.64]Lead, follow, or get out of the way.
[37:32.16]I was trying to, like, move my character.
[37:34.28]Instead, you acted alone and without regard to your element, your duty, or your responsibility.
[37:40.17]Until this investigation is completed, I think it's best that you continue to train and study.
[37:44.59]Yeah.
[37:46.17]Replay the scenario.
[37:49.90]Let's go.
[37:50.44]I hear you.
[37:52.96]Okay.
[37:53.66]This is a soft probe.
[37:54.88]I want stealth movement.
[37:56.85]Remember all of you just because the suspect is a female does not mean she's any less vibe Yeah, I Didn't shoot anybody You just okay, yeah, yeah, yeah interesting there's the gun it's loaded let's go Locked and loaded.

[38:38.27]Okay, cool.
[38:38.85]Your last unit in working order.
[38:41.11]Good.
[38:42.27]Remember, the last unit is not used for lengthy discussions between assaulters.
[38:46.53]It's for keeping the brass informed.
[38:48.79]And the other persons outside your sightlines.
[38:51.46]You understand?
[38:52.04]Okay, so... Good.
[38:53.74]I didn't do the movement tutorial.
[39:05.71]Okay, here we go.

[41:22.19]Not this way, apparently.
[41:23.23]Alright, here we go.
[41:27.90]We're going in the back, right?
[41:29.66]There's the old lady with the gun!
[41:58.99]Alright, let's... I guess we're gonna try this again.
[42:01.11]We have to go... She's around the back door.
[42:11.38]Here comes the breach.
[42:13.64]And now... They're going in.
[42:18.38]Fully auto.
[42:18.96]Yep, that's fine.
[42:22.18]No, get the gun.
[42:22.80]Take out the gun.
[42:25.38]Fucking gun.
[42:26.20]Take out the goddamn fucking gun.
[42:41.44]Yeah, okay.
[42:43.00]I got it.
[42:48.31]So I can't go this way.
[42:50.57]I can't take the gun out because I'll shoot over there.
[42:54.55]So what am I supposed to do?
[43:02.95]If she comes around the corner, man, I'm unloading a whole clip.
[43:10.03]Okay, I got a thumbs up.
[43:11.49]What do you mean go?
[43:13.47]Go where?
[43:15.56]Where am I going?
[43:19.34]What the fuck?
[43:25.98]What the fuck?
[43:27.06]I keep getting told to go.
[43:39.11]Seriously.
[43:41.10]What if I go back?
[43:47.93]What the fuck are you doing?
[43:50.55]I'm being grabbed now.
[43:53.59]I'm gone.
[43:55.81]Now I'm gone.
[43:57.03]You did it right.
[43:57.97]You screwed up.
[43:58.61]I don't get this.
[44:12.70]I can't- Oh, I can go up this way.
[44:13.90]Okay.
[44:15.30]I didn't- Okay, I got a mirror.
[44:37.75]Alright, use the mirror.
[44:41.08]There she is.
[44:42.89]There she is.
[44:43.75]She's hiding.
[44:44.19]I can see her.
[44:46.31]Throw a fucking smoke bomb over there.
[44:57.50]Today was not a victory, but a defeat.
[45:00.60]We were not successful in saving the life of the suspect we wish to apprehend.
[45:04.90]Rather, we lost that life and jeopardized the lives of others.
[45:08.90]It is true that the suspect determines the outcome of a crisis, but it's our responsibility to help guide the suspect towards a peaceful resolution.
[45:17.62]Remember, a truly successful resolution is one where no shots are fired.
[45:23.53]I didn't shoot any guns.
[45:24.91]I threw a fucking smoke bomb.
[45:26.55]You will be cooperative, helpful, and honest when dealing with investigators.
[45:31.18]Until the investigation is complete, I'm suspending Pup from active duty status.
[45:37.16]Pup?
[45:37.50]Yeah, yeah, okay, fuck off.
[45:40.02]Let's go.
[45:42.34]Oh, look, guys.
[45:44.35]There's this lady over there.
[45:45.49]Uh, pull back, clear containment, compromise closet, left.
[45:50.69]In position, coming out hostage, suspect.
[45:53.89]Suspect.
[45:56.52]Suspect.
[45:58.56]Copy.
[45:59.84]What?
[46:01.74]Oh, I just said suspect in the phone.
[46:07.86]Am I doing those hands?
[46:09.26]Take my place.
[46:12.98]What's happening here?
[46:16.25]Oh, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god!
[46:17.87]Suspect!
[46:19.63]Suspect!

[46:31.91]Suspect.
[46:32.97]I... Pup, the lash is not a toy.
[46:37.54]Find your comments to the situation at hand.
[46:43.92]I had to do that to save the office's life.
[46:51.24]Today was not a VI-
[46:59.84]Okay, hold on.
[47:00.46]Wait, I- Suspect.
[47:08.24]Uh... G- Left.

[47:17.95]Got it.
[47:19.43]Pup, the Lash is not a toy.
[47:21.47]What the fuck are you talking about?
[47:22.57]Suspect.
[47:22.73]Suspect.
[47:28.72]Suspect.
[47:30.12]Suspect left is not okay, but suspect just with no fucking context is not okay.
[47:37.29]I have to like fucking yell at this guy.
[47:42.91]Okay, hold on.
[47:50.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[47:53.60]Cover.
[47:54.60]Suspect.
[48:02.65]Get cover.
[48:04.99]Is this guy gonna die?
[48:12.85]Like, is it left?
[48:14.02]Is it his left or my right?
[48:18.14]I can't stop saying level.
[48:19.08]Is it, like, his right or my, like, left?
[48:23.32]Suspect, like, side...
[48:29.73]Look out!
[48:30.11]Left compromised.
[48:30.59]Hold on.
[48:30.97]Left compromised.
[48:31.81]Oh my god.
[48:33.61]This guy's gonna die.
[48:34.55]How am I supposed to say this?
[48:35.51]Like, pull back?
[48:58.10]Pull back.
[49:00.80]Pup, the lash is not a toy.
[49:03.22]Confine your comments to the situation at hand.
[49:05.18]Then this guy's gonna die.
[49:06.27]Like, this guy's gonna die.
[49:08.51]Pull back.
[49:09.93]Suspect.
[49:15.55]And... Give me a high five.
[49:18.57]Pull back.
[49:19.41]Suspect.
[49:22.38]Pup, the lash is not a toy.
[49:24.80]Confine your comments to the... Okay, well...
[49:29.30]Wait, she's putting her hands up.
[49:31.54]Lucy, this is the police.
[49:33.72]We are here to help you.
[49:35.20]Lucy, will you let us help you?
[49:45.09]Alright, everyone, take a seat.
[49:47.03]Before I get started, Lieutenant Hancock has a few things to say.
[49:50.07]We did it.
[49:50.71]Sir?
[49:52.21]Congratulations, officers.
[49:53.47]You did an excellent job today.
[49:55.01]But when I go over there, she shoots the shit out of me.
[49:56.75]We have our suspect in custody.
[49:58.24]What the fuck?
[49:58.88]Keep up the good work.
[50:00.62]Sergeant Rooker.
[50:01.14]What a joke.
[50:02.48]You men did a fine job out there today.
[50:04.68]Take pride in your efforts.
[50:06.44]I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't see a commendation or two headed this way.
[50:09.66]Okay.
[50:10.14]Well, that's it.
[50:11.31]Get some rest.
[50:12.41]Nice.
[50:12.77]Good.
[50:12.93]Dismissed.
[50:14.13]We did it.
[50:15.07]That means I'm ready to go.
[50:15.85]I'm trained.
[50:16.25]Uh, no.
[50:19.47]Matt, what's...
[50:22.44]Let's do it.
[50:22.92]I want to do another one.
[50:27.16]I don't care about any of that.
[50:28.48]Metro.
[50:28.70]What is this?
[50:39.50]Hello, I'm JD.
[50:41.36]JD Saunders.
[50:42.64]I bet you're the new guy from Rooker's squad.
[50:44.50]Yeah, I'm- Interested in learning to shoot.
[50:47.30]That's great.
[50:47.94]Do I get a sniper rifle?
[50:48.98]I'm the sniper without a partner.
[50:51.33]Oh, that's amazing.
[50:52.33]Yeah, all snipers are paired up.
[50:54.17]While one's on the rifle, the other one serves as an observer.
[50:57.27]Save game.
[50:57.65]I will, don't worry.
[50:58.05]Interested in learning to sharpshoot.
[51:00.11]Alright, come on.
[51:01.35]I'll show you around.
[51:03.47]Colt 45.
[51:03.87]Select this thing.
[51:08.22]Save it.
[51:09.12]I know, I'm saving it.
[51:09.88]Don't worry.
[51:12.70]Okay, let's do it.
[51:14.02]I'm just gonna check this out.
[51:17.96]I'll show you the rifle.
[51:18.58]I'll go over it with you.
[51:19.40]Thanks.
[51:21.20]That's Sergeant Pruitt.
[51:22.57]He's in charge of sniper training.
[51:24.19]Okay.
[51:24.49]He'll tell you he's not a very good sharpshooter, but don't let that fool you.
[51:27.99]You don't ever want to be on the other side of his scope.
[51:32.25]I'm having a lot of trouble figuring this out that this is me.
[51:36.57]I keep thinking I am the camera.
[51:37.61]It's going to be click thing.
[51:38.35]I just want to know how to use it.
[51:39.27]I just want to know how to use it.
[51:40.17]I don't care about anything else.
[51:56.92]Out here, we shoot a designated target, officer.
[52:00.04]That's what you'd like to do.
[52:01.93]Out here, we shoot a designated target, officer.
[52:05.03]That's what you'd like to do.
[52:06.31]I suggest you and Officer Saunders head downrange and set up that SR-60.
[52:10.13]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:11.47]Alright, that was fun.
[52:12.37]We did it.
[52:12.71]The game just fucking exploded.
[52:18.95]The game crashed.
[52:19.97]It just died.
[52:21.63]Okay, let's... Alright.
[52:26.32]There we go.
[52:28.27]Game is saved.
[52:28.89]Whoa.
[52:35.39]That's loud gaming.
[52:36.87]Okay.
[52:43.48]Okay.
[52:46.74]Previous career.
[52:48.76]Loaded.
[52:49.50]And this time we're just going to restore.
[52:52.98]Restore.
[52:55.35]And it got louder.
[52:56.75]How did this get louder?
[52:58.19]Why did this Jack the fucking volume all the way up?
[53:02.28]Don't ask me.
[53:05.88]Volume's back.
[53:06.60]Move this, move that.
[53:08.86]Okay, here we go.
[53:10.02]Let's get back into it.
[53:14.65]Go back to the travel map.
[53:17.95]We got into the mission yet?
[53:21.11]Not yet.
[53:28.05]Police Academy, like, where, like... Like, how do I get, how do I get another game?
[53:33.82]How do I get, like, another... mission?
[53:44.96]Where's the mission?
[53:45.56]I don't care about any of this.
[53:54.69]Do I have to do the sniper tutorial?
[54:02.23]I gotta learn to snipe.
[54:03.22]Alright, well, whatever.
[54:03.90]Fine.
[54:06.05]I thought I lost you.
[54:06.85]Glad to see you're back.
[54:08.31]Oh, he remembers.
[54:08.93]Let me go over the rifle with you.
[54:10.07]Help you set it up.
[54:10.94]I just walked out of this guy's house.
[54:12.28]That's Sergeant Pruitt.
[54:13.42]He's in charge of sniper training.
[54:15.24]Now, he'll tell you he's not a very good sharpshooter, but don't let him fool you.
[54:18.92]You'd never want to be on the other side of his skull.
[54:20.92]Yep.
[54:21.82]Just fuck this.
[54:22.78]We're going to go straight down here.
[54:23.93]Yeah, I know.
[54:24.51]Yes, I know.
[54:25.33]Rooker's new man.
[54:25.95]He is the new recruit.
[54:26.69]How are you, officer?
[54:27.37]Adjusting to deep platoon, are you?
[54:28.91]Yes, sir.
[54:29.37]Thank you.
[54:29.83]Very good.
[54:30.81]And it would appear you have an interest in the science of sharpshooting.
[54:33.94]Why don't you let Saunders familiarize you on the SR-60?
[54:36.40]Thought I lost you.
[54:37.06]By the time you get set up, the rest of the sharpshooters should be here when we begin our basic training exercise.
[54:42.06]Thank you, sir.
[54:44.56]We'll set up down here.
[54:49.50]Now, I don't know how much you know about sniping.
[54:52.53]I thought he was going to aim that at me.
[54:53.75]I'm going to begin with the basics.
[54:55.67]This is a Robar SR-60 .308 bolt-action rifle.
[55:03.77]Here at LAPD, we zero our rifles at 100 yards.
[55:10.27]We always begin with a cold barrel shot.
[55:13.81]We use a cold barrel shot to establish our zero.
[55:18.03]It's also the most important shot out in the field.
[55:23.34]First thing you don't want to do is establish your zero on this rifle.
[55:28.04]You do that because it's new to you.
[55:29.59]Don't we have math problems now?
[55:30.81]Like establish zero?
[55:32.21]You do that, you want to get out your dope book.
[55:35.69]You want to establish the date, the time of day, wind direction, direction of light, temperature.
[55:42.76]Also, verify your ammo lot.
[55:44.80]You'll need to consult the charts in your dope book for any elevation or windage adjustments needed in order to make your 100-yard cold barrel shot.
[55:51.80]Yeah, blah, blah, blah.
[55:52.92]Give me the gun, shoot gun, look down, fucking sight, shoot guy.
[55:55.68]I'm going to load a single round for your cold barrel shot.
[56:01.65]You reload when you're ready to shoot your first group of five.
[56:04.99]Okay.
[56:06.37]Now I'll be over here functioning as your spotter.
[56:08.10]I'll answer any questions you may have.
[56:09.50]Spotter?
[56:09.98]What am I doing?
[56:10.58]Bench press?
[56:11.04]The whole barrel shot will be taken at 100 yards and you need to shoot a minute of angle.
[56:16.72]In layman's terms, you're going to want to place a shot in a one inch square at 100 yards.
[56:22.79]Target's already set up for you.
[56:27.21]nice one alright let's go now to check the zero on your rifle you're going to want to take a shot aiming at the center of the one-inch square but before you do a few things you need to know yeah first the bullet drop compensator knob or your BDC my knob top knob on your scope this is the knob you use to compensate for up down
[56:49.00]The right knob, the windage knob, is twofold.
[56:51.96]Yes, it allows you to adjust for wind, but it also functions as a horizontal adjustment when zeroing.
[56:58.62]To make sure you're accurately adjusting for zero and not wind, you'll want to take your cold barrel shot when the wind is less than three miles per hour.
[57:06.27]How do I know that?
[57:07.07]The left knob is your focus knob.
[57:09.59]Is the sight picture clear?
[57:11.17]Yeah.
[57:11.49]If so, then you're in focus and you need not touch your focus.
[57:16.16]Alright.
[57:17.18]What we want to accomplish with this first shot is to determine how this particular lot of ammo shoots under the current settings on your scope.
[57:24.11]Check the flag.
[57:25.27]Once we see where your shot strikes, we'll be able to determine what type of adjustments are needed.
[57:30.61]You want to sight in on your target.
[57:32.57]Wind is under three miles an hour.
[57:34.69]It'll be a good time to shoot.
[57:37.46]Shoot.
[57:42.88]Why is that guy yelling from the bathroom?
[57:45.44]How do I shoot?
[57:46.08]How do you shoot the gun?
[57:48.32]How do you fire the gun?
[58:15.87]We have comm.
[58:17.11]Fire at will.
[58:19.44]Pull the trigger.
[58:20.22]What?
[58:20.62]Where's the trigger?
[58:23.98]Turn the knob?
[58:24.74]Oh.
[58:24.94]Oh, I didn't- you didn't even- Oh my god.
[58:26.52]What?
[58:54.57]What is it talking about?
[58:55.41]What?
[58:59.11]Hold on, what is he saying?
[59:00.00]You must click your windage five more times to the left.
[59:05.46]You must click your BDC up two more times.
[59:08.00]Wait, which one is windage?
[59:09.68]Five more times to the left?
[59:14.79]What is it?
[59:15.23]What the fuck is it saying?
[59:22.13]Spotter confirming bullseye.
[59:24.03]Got it.
[59:24.23]Good shooting.
[59:26.23]Very good.
[59:27.74]Now let's reload.
[59:28.88]Try one.
[59:35.56]Target missed completely.
[59:36.78]Missed completely?
[59:37.94]Given your current BDC and windage settings, the problem would appear to be with the shooter and not the current adjustments.
[59:44.30]Please.
[59:45.16]Spotter confirming bullseye.
[59:47.24]Good shooting.
[59:47.64]That was, like, so perfectly.
[59:49.53]Okay, we have nine one-and-a-half-inch targets.
[59:52.77]Each target requires its own center hit.
[59:55.31]Begin top left to right.
[59:57.33]Load your rifle and fire at will.
[60:01.13]Spotter confirming miss.
[60:03.97]So we're going to go one, two, three.
[60:06.23]Please reload and fire at will.
[60:08.16]Like this.
[60:12.16]Spotter confirming center hit.
[60:14.02]Hit is within target.
[60:15.24]Got it.
[60:17.00]Please reload and fire at will.
[60:21.20]Spotter confirming center hit.
[60:22.76]Got it.
[60:27.04]Speed run this.
[60:28.28]Spotter confirming miss.
[60:29.94]What?
[60:30.10]What do you mean miss?
[60:34.25]Spotter confirming... I got it, right?
[60:38.03]Oh, please.
[60:39.19]Please reload and fire at will.
[60:42.22]Spotter confirming miss.
[60:44.54]What?
[60:44.74]That's not a miss?
[60:45.68]I fucking... What?
[60:46.58]It's right in there.
[60:47.42]Please reload and fire at will.
[60:50.34]Spotter confirming miss.
[60:52.76]What?
[60:55.26]Please reload and fire at will.
[60:57.46]Where are you... Where are your eyes looking right now?
[61:00.08]Because that was a direct hit.
[61:02.38]Spotter confirming miss.
[61:03.82]I...
[61:07.32]Please reload and fire at will.
[61:11.18]These are all in there.
[61:12.42]These are in there pretty well, if I were to say.
[61:19.40]Spotter confirming miss.
[61:23.16]It's just in the square.
[61:24.30]Please reload and fire at will.
[61:26.84]It's inside the square.
[61:34.37]Spotter confirming miss.
[61:36.77]That's literally in the fucking... That was a good session.
[61:39.04]You want to go again?
[61:40.14]Or are you done for the day?
[61:40.94]No, I'm done.
[61:41.48]I'm done.
[61:41.96]Get the fuck away from me.
[61:43.68]You fucking idiot.
[61:45.98]Go fuck yourself.
[61:53.43]There's nothing to... Come on!
[61:55.49]Tactical movement.
[61:57.71]No, I don't care about this, actually.
[62:06.43]So where's the next mission?
[62:10.21]Where's the mission?
[62:11.19]Like, do I just have to keep reloading this?
[62:16.26]Until there's a fucking mission?
[62:35.14]I gotta learn shit.
[62:35.98]I just did it.
[62:42.21]Training bulletins, tactical movements, sharpshooter considerations.
[62:47.03]Need to be briefed.
[62:48.37]How do I get briefed?
[62:49.19]I need disk two.
[63:13.24]How do I do this?
[63:19.74]I mean, I did, like, the sniper thing.
[63:26.90]Topics.
[63:27.32]Training Bullets.
[63:28.28]Commands for the D Platoon.
[63:29.62]Like, I don't get it.
[63:30.66]I need to do more training?
[63:36.06]Yeah, I should save it, that's true.
[63:38.42]I don't understand, like, click the start mission button.
[63:46.90]Where's the start mission button?
[63:55.48]Not the D, Platoon!
[63:56.67]Go back to the bunker.
[64:17.49]Uh... Okay, well, like, this is just, like, nothing here.
[64:26.62]Do I have to go back and, like, finish the sniper training or something?
[64:29.58]I don't know.
[64:35.28]Selected, I guess.
[64:36.02]I don't know.
[64:36.38]I don't understand.
[64:39.97]Angled range?
[64:43.19]Hi, Sarge.
[64:43.89]Good afternoon, officer.
[64:45.65]We'll be shooting a variety of paper and reactive targets today.
[64:49.27]You take your place at one of the tables down range and set up.
[64:52.11]We should be starting soon.
[64:53.89]Thank you, sir.
[64:55.77]Okay.
[64:58.55]Cold 45 sniper.
[64:59.55]That didn't work.
[65:04.98]Well, that didn't work.
[65:07.92]Welcome back, officer.
[65:09.34]Saunders is anxious to get started.
[65:11.00]Okay.
[65:15.32]Well, if you'll excuse me, sir.
[65:16.77]Certainly.
[65:17.63]I believe you'll find Saunders downrange already set up.
[65:22.79]Hey, JD.
[65:23.81]Hey.
[65:24.13]What are you talking about?
[65:25.37]Hey, I've just finished shooting.
[65:26.25]How about if I spot for you?
[65:27.91]There's nowhere for me to go.
[65:29.25]I have to do this.
[65:29.89]Human silhouette up.
[65:30.89]Range estimation required.
[65:32.75]Employ the following formula to estimate the distance between you and your target.
[65:36.76]Determine the height of your target in yards.
[65:39.26]Using your reticule, determine how many mil dots high your target is.
[65:43.14]If your sight picture is clear, no adjustment to focus is necessary.
[65:51.22]Fucking shoot it then.
[65:52.47]What are you doing?
[65:54.43]Human silhouette up.

[67:40.45]Okay, that was a good session.
[67:41.17]You want to go again or are you done for the day?
[67:42.57]I might as well go again because, like, what else am I going to do?

[67:49.19]Pull out area to be hit.

[69:17.47]This is a fucking dad game.
[69:19.79]Oh!
[69:21.29]Here we go.
[69:21.95]Hey, how you doing, pup?
[69:23.19]I hear you've been out on the long rifle range with Saunders and Tello.
[69:27.57]Sergeant Pruitt's got a sniper qualification soon.
[69:30.05]Okay.
[69:30.57]You want to attempt qualifying?
[69:32.43]Mm-hmm.
[69:34.05]I do.
[69:35.19]Yes.
[69:36.81]Great.
[69:37.61]I'll let Sergeant Pruitt know you're interested.
[69:40.16]Good luck.
[69:40.88]Thank you.
[69:42.40]You know, I'm pleased to see you're taking an interest in sharpshooting.
[69:45.78]It's a proud discipline.
[69:46.80]Alright, so we're going to get an opportunity here to...
[69:50.75]Thank you.
[69:51.09]Let's let's do it.
[69:51.79]We're going to go qualify as a sniper.
[69:55.19]Colt 45 row bar SR six.
[69:58.36]Let's go.
[70:01.50]Qualify me.
[70:04.22]Hello, Sergeant Pruitt.
[70:05.16]Oh, good afternoon.
[70:06.00]We'll be running a 15 round qualification today.
[70:08.85]Stick around if you'd like to score.
[70:10.69]Thank you, sir.
[70:11.57]We'll be starting soon.
[70:12.49]So I suggest you get set up.
[70:15.17]Save, save.
[70:15.77]Good idea.
[70:20.73]Saved.
[70:21.92]Well, if you'll excuse me, sir.
[70:23.36]Certainly.
[70:24.20]I believe you'll find Saunders downrange already set up.
[70:28.76]Hello, Diddy.
[70:29.68]Zeroing.
[70:30.52]Doesn't understand zeroing.
[70:31.62]You don't have to understand it.
[70:32.64]If you're interested, stay and shoot.
[70:35.83]If you pass the 15-round 100-yard minimum angle qualification, you'll be eligible to be called up as a sniper during a crisis.
[70:42.27]Good.
[70:43.37]How about it?
[70:44.95]I'll stay in spot for you.
[70:46.53]Okay, let's go.
[70:51.27]Qualification begins with a coal barrel shot in a one inch square.
[70:54.95]Yep.
[70:55.13]Then a five round group in a one and a half inch square.
[70:57.92]Okay.
[70:58.36]And then nine bullseyes each in a one inch square.
[71:01.78]All from 100 yards.
[71:03.58]Load your weapon.
[71:04.50]And when ready, fire at will for your coal barrel shot.
[71:12.63]Okay.
[71:14.27]Target missed completely.
[71:15.57]Wait.
[71:18.66]Sorry to say, you didn't shoot 100%.
[71:20.44]Oh, you have to shoot 100%.
[71:22.09]Don't take it too hard.
[71:23.55]Oh, fuck.
[71:24.39]There'll be another qualification round real soon, and you can shoot again.
[71:26.61]Thanks for the support, JD.
[71:28.67]God, that was tougher and more stressful than I thought it would be.
[71:31.38]It always is.
[71:33.56]But consider if you were shooting in a real-life scenario.
[71:36.62]A hostage rescue.
[71:37.48]I know, yeah, okay, let me...
[71:39.45]You master your fieldcraft, marksmanship, and tactics.
[71:42.52]Well, that's... Okay.
[71:43.98]You'll make a damn fine sniper when it counts.
[71:46.40]So how are you supposed to... I think I'm just going to clean my rifle and hit the road.
[71:50.66]Understood.
[71:55.36]Colt .45 caliber 9...
[72:00.91]Well, if you'll excuse me, sir.
[72:02.33]Certainly.
[72:03.21]I believe you'll find Saunders downrange already set up.
[72:07.50]I... I... I gotta save us, like, right here.
[72:10.28]Today is call day.
[72:12.08]If you're interested... No, boy, that was stressful.
[72:14.56]I'd missed completely.
[72:15.64]That sucked.
[72:16.46]You'll be eligible to be called up as a sniper during a crisis.
[72:22.38]How about it?
[72:23.96]I'll stay in spot for you.
[72:28.01]Gotta use the knobs.
[72:29.17]Okay, save it right here.
[72:33.11]Qualification begins with a cold barrel shot in a one inch square.
[72:37.00]Then a five round group in a one and a half inch square.
[72:40.22]And then nine bull guys- Alright, so I'm looking at the flag.
[72:41.56]It looks like there's a little bit of wind.
[72:42.54]One inch square.
[72:43.64]All from 100 yards.
[72:45.44]Load your weapon.
[72:46.34]And when ready, fire at will for your cold barrel shot.
[72:49.14]Okay, a little bit of wind.
[72:56.41]Cold barrel shot.
[72:57.97]Fire at will.
[73:05.39]Cold barrel shot.
[73:06.95]Fire at will.

[73:14.95]Fire at will.
[73:16.83]Um... Come on!
[73:22.41]Cold barrel shot.

[73:23.97]Fire at will.
[73:26.98]Oh my god.
[73:27.84]Like, now it's all fucked up because of this stupid piece of shit.
[73:31.46]Cold barrel shot.
[73:33.02]Fire at will.
[73:36.47]Target missed completely.
[73:40.09]Sorry to say, you didn't shoot 100%.
[73:44.11]But don't take it too hard.
[73:44.95]There'll be another qualification round soon if you shoot again.
[73:48.19]Well, I grabbed it.
[73:50.11]God, that was tougher and more stressful than I thought it would be.
[73:52.84]It always is.
[73:55.00]But consider if you were shooting in a real-life scenario.
[73:57.92]Oh, I can't fucking wait to save the shit out of this.
[74:00.90]You master your fieldcraft, marksmanship, and tactics here on the range.
[74:05.42]You'll make a damn fine sniper when it counts.
[74:07.17]I have to use the book.
[74:08.19]Well, I think I've had it for today.
[74:09.25]I think I'm just going to clean my rifle and hit the road.
[74:11.79]No, I don't understand the zeroing because I wasn't paying attention to the entire thing.
[74:16.53]Sorry, like the one time I have to pay attention to the fucking game.
[74:23.52]Cold barrel shot.
[74:25.08]Fire at will.
[74:27.83]I'm so angry right now.
[74:33.50]Cold barrel shot.
[74:34.76]Something to do with this, the fucking wind compensation, right?
[74:39.32]The wind is like going over this, it's going this way.
[74:42.54]Cold barrel shot.
[74:44.11]Fire at will.
[74:47.57]I haven't touched the most important part.
[74:51.51]Cold barrel shot.
[74:53.07]Fire at will.
[74:56.10]No, it's gonna be like... Cold barrel shot.
[75:02.12]Fire at will.
[75:02.72]Because the wind's pushing this way.
[75:08.14]I don't even like fucking care.
[75:09.76]Cold barrel shot.
[75:11.13]Fire at will.
[75:11.83]If I miss, we're fucking safe.

[75:16.37]It has to be higher than this?
[75:18.57]Cold barrel shot.

[99:15.84]Like, I want to put the fucking pie down.
[99:17.76]I don't want to use the pie right now.
[99:20.30]I want to put it down.
[99:21.60]Put sliced pie down.
[99:40.02]Like how do I put the fucking pie down?
[99:46.70]Pull back.
[99:48.74]Keep your sights on the door.

[100:27.39]I have to sit- If I look at the fucking door, she shoots from the bed.
[100:33.45]If I look at the bed, she shoots from the door.

[103:09.80]Lucy!
[103:12.37]Lucy, are you in there?
[103:15.55]You need to come out with your hands up, Lucy.
[103:20.24]Lucy.
[103:24.60]Get out here.
[103:30.62]Okay, she's not in the toilet.
[103:33.45]Then where did she go?
[103:38.40]She's sitting... She's in the shower.
[103:41.60]Okay, hold on.

[104:01.26]Suspect down.
[104:02.86]Officer coming out.
[104:04.20]EMT needed now.
[104:10.03]Today was not a victory, but a defeat.
[104:13.15]We were not successful in saving the life of the suspect we wish to apprehend.
[104:17.47]Rather, we lost.
[104:21.11]Lucy?
[104:22.75]What?
[104:23.09]She's fired!
[104:24.46]Oh my god, I just want... She's dead.
[104:29.94]Hold on, how did I kill her?
[104:32.36]Today was not a victory, but a defeat.
[104:34.06]She just fell asleep.
[104:35.48]We were not successful.
[104:37.52]Okay.
[104:39.20]Lucy?
[104:41.94]Yeah, there she is.
[104:42.74]I can see her in the mirror.
[104:43.64]Oh, maybe they can't see me.
[104:45.42]Alright, I gotta... Let's get the pie out.
[104:53.44]No, turn around.
[104:55.60]No, no, no, no, don't shoot me through this.
[105:02.54]I gotta bring up the menu.
[105:07.28]Lucy, we're the police.
[105:15.83]What am I doing?
[105:19.29]What am I doing?
[105:19.93]What the fuck am I doing?
[105:20.73]Just cut it out already.
[105:22.20]That was just dumb.
[105:23.00]I didn't need to do that.
[105:44.39]She comes out, there's the suspect.
[105:46.07]Lucy, we're the police.
[105:48.35]Keep your hands where we can- Okay, here she comes.
[105:51.67]I just tried throwing the grenade.
[106:06.38]Alright, everyone, take a seat.
[106:07.96]Before I get started, Lieutenant Hancock has a few things to say.
[106:12.24]Sir?
[106:12.62]Y'all did a great job, and I... Congratulations, officers.
[106:15.00]You did an excellent job today.
[106:17.32]Thanks to your efforts, we have our suspect in custody.
[106:20.35]Keep up the good work.
[106:21.37]Same lady, by the way.
[106:22.19]Sergeant Rooker?
[106:24.03]You men did a fine job out there today.
[106:26.21]Take pride in your efforts.
[106:27.99]I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't see accommodation or two headed this way.
[106:31.66]Well, that's it.
[106:32.84]Get some rest.
[106:33.60]Get some rest.
[106:34.46]Dismissed.
[106:35.12]The next mission is when Grandma's on the roof.
[106:41.13]Alright.
[106:41.59]Does that mean we can just keep going now?
[106:43.13]Like, I don't have any more, like, training to do, right?
[106:47.71]What do I?
[106:48.21]I don't know.
[106:48.79]Colt 40, row bar SR 60.
[106:50.55]Like, I guess we just have to move around until we get the next, like...
[106:58.06]Welcome back, officer.
[106:59.40]Saunders and I were just wondering if you'd be back.
[107:01.98]Now that you are, why don't you head downrange and get set up?
[107:05.52]Okay.
[107:07.00]Well, if you'll excuse me, sir.
[107:08.45]Certainly.
[107:09.31]I believe you'll find Saunders downrange already set up.
[107:13.64]Alright.
[107:14.70]Hey, JD.
[107:15.62]Hey.
[107:16.08]Just gotta wait two minutes.
[107:17.12]Hey, I've just finished shooting.
[107:17.96]How about if I spot for you?
[107:19.78]That'd be great, thanks.
[107:21.29]Okay, we have nine one-and-a-half-inch targets.
[107:24.11]Yes, we do.
[107:24.55]Each target requires its own center hit.
[107:27.19]Good acting.
[107:29.01]Load your rifle and fire at will.
[107:33.14]So, I mean, how do I, like, save?
[107:37.32]Oh, yeah.
[107:37.54]Good idea.
[107:46.95]I don't think I have to do any of this.
[107:48.33]I'll see you later, partner.
[107:49.93]Next time, try to stay for the entire drill.
[107:53.10]It doesn't matter.
[107:53.62]I just need to wait for the next mission.
[107:57.08]I just have to wait around, I guess.
[108:02.66]Just keep moving around until I get to do something.
[108:09.21]Some people gave some money.
[108:10.03]Let me just make sure I say hello to these people.
[108:12.96]Purple, thanks for the ten bucks.
[108:14.96]This is like being trapped in a nightmare where no matter what you do, somebody dies.
[108:18.08]It's a fixed point in time.
[108:20.35]Pretty much.
[108:21.89]Also, thanks to Breenland.
[108:23.57]Ilvery for the bits, five bucks.
[108:24.99]And so continues the classic struggle between Jerma and Grandma's Got a Gun.
[108:28.93]Never will there be an outcome where both will live.
[108:34.22]Purple also gave five dollars earlier, too.
[108:35.98]Thanks, dude.
[108:38.43]All that training just to die in one second to somebody playing... Payday 2.
[108:42.03]God.
[108:43.37]Uh, thanks a lot, guys.
[108:49.20]Uh, we're gonna stay on this till- for one more mission.
[108:52.98]And if it's another grandma mission, I'm gonna scream.
[108:56.34]So, those of you that, like, have, like, the tutorial, like, up.
[109:00.50]If I just sit here, will this- will this go off?
[109:11.89]Just keep doing the training and then... Okay, well... I mean, I guess I'm just gonna... No, it won't.
[109:18.16]I'm gonna do, like, this shit.
[109:23.94]Okay.
[109:25.65]Just go to combat range, I guess.
[109:35.29]What am I supposed to do?
[109:41.17]Next?
[109:41.35]It's like 11.
[109:41.81]What else are we gonna do in under a half an hour?

[112:23.14]Should have been with me fishing last week and seen those whitecaps on the lake.
[112:29.04]I don't know what any of them just said.

[112:35.29]Now knock that off and go get set up.
[112:37.21]What the hell are you talking about?
[112:38.39]What did I do?

[120:35.03]We got a new scenario, boys.
[120:36.79]And girls.
[120:37.48]Travel across the railroad tracks and set up across the way.
[120:40.58]The east side of the building faces the train tracks.
[120:42.95]That's where the entrance is.
[120:44.53]I need you to provide cover for the entry team.
[120:46.85]You're Sierra One.
[120:48.28]contact me as soon as you're in position right I have to drive a car what's the situation we're not sure yet officers tobin and bale from central were answering a code 30 atom the officers found the front entrance door open as they were entering the building they were fired upon bale was shot in the face nonchalantly saying that around the back of the building and called for assistance
[121:10.23]Real subtle.
[121:10.63]Zero one.
[121:11.05]I thought that was a guy with a gun.
[121:12.39]I was about to be like, what?
[121:25.24]Well, of course.
[121:26.12]I don't want any more damage to occur than already has.
[121:28.72]Mrs. Schneibley, this is Sergeant Rooker.
[121:30.62]Would you mind repeating to him what you just told me?
[121:32.70]Okay.
[121:32.86]Well, yes, of course.
[121:33.90]Hello, I'm Marcia Schneibley.
[121:35.70]I own this building.
[121:36.36]Well, the business does.
[121:36.92]Schneibley?
[121:37.50]I was just telling this officer here that, well, my warehouse is missing.
[121:41.36]And when the police called this morning and said something about someone shooting off guns in the warehouse... This whole game was filmed in one room.
[121:45.68]Yeah, it probably was.
[121:46.64]Where's Hector?
[121:47.22]I mean, he's a diligent employee.
[121:49.06]He would not just allow someone to come in and shoot up my building.
[121:51.70]Mrs. Schneibley, do you think it could be Hector firing off these weapons?
[121:57.68]Somebody is just shooting in there.
[121:58.90]God.
[121:59.02]Okay, well, we got another hostile grandmother.
[122:00.98]Goodbye.
[122:01.22]Okay.
[122:01.34]Are we ready?
[122:01.78]Are we going in?
[122:26.92]This is Officer Keeler.
[122:28.44]He was one of the responding officers to the 30 Atom.
[122:31.34]As I was telling Packmeyer, we get false alarms down here all the time.
[122:35.43]The wind's always blowing the doors open on these old buildings, or we have transients camping out.
[122:40.19]The last thing I expected was gunfire.
[122:42.47]Did you see anyone?
[122:44.40]No, not really.
[122:45.06]Everything happened real quick.
[122:46.16]We were approaching the door.
[122:48.06]It was partially open.
[122:50.34]Bales went to reach for it.
[122:51.38]He had his hand on the doorknob.
[122:53.55]It seemed to me that the door was closing rather than opening.
[122:56.65]I got this sinking feeling in my stomach, and then wham.
[123:01.94]I have to turn this shit way down.
[123:04.04]Okay, so now it goes back to normal fucking sounds.
[123:09.94]That's fantastic.
[123:17.31]Are we, like, ready to do this shit, or what?
[123:20.43]The lady's gone.
[123:24.54]I gotta turn this volume way down.
[123:25.98]If I have a plan, I'm like talking to people.
[123:30.60]It's as low as it can fucking go.
[123:31.84]Is it gonna save the game too?
[123:32.86]Right in the front.
[123:38.69]Alright, so we can only go in one door.

[124:28.39]Yes, officer.
[124:29.01]What did you find out from the owner of the property?
[124:32.29]I didn't talk to her, sir.
[124:33.73]Why not?
[124:34.69]I gave you specific directions to speak to her.
[124:37.75]Sir, I... Officer, go find Mrs. Schneibley and find out what you can from her.
[124:43.04]Oh, my God.
[124:43.82]Where the fuck did she... Where is she?
[124:45.14]She's not over here.
[124:48.50]She's, like, not even here anymore.

[124:54.22]That's great Is it do I have to go like this way that I don't understand she's not even here She's gone briefing everyone come on let's go Okay, this is what we know we have one wounded officer and weapons fire is randomly erupting from within the structure CNT's been telephoning the warehouse, but there's been no pickup
[125:22.71]Jerma, I need you to go to the command post and I want you to snipe.
[125:26.63]Season 1 and Season 2 of Breaking Bad are the best ones.
[125:29.70]Season 3, it slowed down a little too much.
[125:32.68]And then you see Season 4, halfway through, got kind of bad.
[125:36.98]It was okay, though.
[125:39.12]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[125:41.50]We lost audio.
[125:42.91]That's why I'm doing this.
[125:47.69]No audio at all.
[125:50.87]Okay, good thing I'm getting, um... Good thing I'm getting a good briefing here.

[126:05.58]Snipe.
[126:06.64]Pup, you're being issued the M16 beret.
[126:10.21]There's a distance between us and the shooter.
[126:12.05]And Pup has the shot.
[126:13.97]It's his.
[126:14.63]Yep.
[126:15.37]Freya, Wixel, you're in on the entry.

[126:22.59]Alright, here we go.
[126:27.28]I have to stay at range.
[126:29.96]And... I need to save this game, though.
[126:37.45]Give me the opportunity to save.
[126:44.29]What are they doing?
[126:49.45]Whose perspective am I looking at here?
[126:50.95]I thought I was supposed to be at like range.
[126:55.38]Hold.
[126:57.48]Try the door.
[127:02.30]Real life CS:GO.
[127:04.27]Try the key.

[127:10.77]Save game.
[127:11.77]Mirror up.
[127:18.31]You can't save in real life.
[127:22.44]Sometimes you can.
[127:34.71]Thumbs up.
[127:35.35]Alright, now give me access to my M16.

[128:15.17]What's happening?
[128:15.69]Did I do it?
[128:17.20]You don't turn and say I'm the designated shooter and then when I shoot the guy you get mad at me.
[128:23.24]What are you talking about?
[128:24.24]You're the shooter.
[128:25.18]Okay.
[128:25.34]No, you're not actually.
[128:38.80]I didn't do that.
[128:39.96]What's going on?
[128:56.00]I asked you to stay behind because I wanted to talk to you about what happened out in the field today.
[129:00.03]I figured that, sir.
[129:01.13]Well, you figured right.
[129:02.85]I'm going to get straight to the point.
[129:04.61]Your errant behavior contributed to the death of a suspect.
[129:08.09]Your tactics were unsound and irresponsible.
[129:11.27]You acted outside the authority of your position within the office.
[129:13.99]This is the classroom.
[129:14.57]I didn't do my homework.
[129:15.33]Investigation into today's events is underway.
[129:18.03]The officer-involved shooting team, the use-of-force review board, the office... Alright, Mom.
[129:24.21]It's your thing.
[129:26.45]Okay so he didn't do that.
[129:28.65]This is the bad guy.
[129:29.49]Okay.
[129:29.75]Who shot the gun?
[129:55.59]What?
[129:56.71]Today was not a victory, but a defeat.
[129:59.84]We were not succe- I thought I wasn't supposed to shoot the guy.
[130:05.32]I mean, should I like, should I put on the fucking pie?
[130:13.14]One down.
[130:13.72]Unknown hostage shooter.
[130:14.96]Hostage is a designated shooter!
[130:16.21]I didn't do that.
[130:17.53]I didn't do that!
[130:18.13]Suspect!
[130:18.93]Put the gun down now!
[130:20.29]Do it!
[130:20.91]No, I didn't do that!
[130:23.05]You won't listen.
[130:24.61]He didn't listen.
[130:27.09]He didn't listen to me.
[130:30.34]What?
[130:30.58]I...
[130:54.70]I think the game just crashed.
[131:00.35]Hold.
[131:00.49]Stop.
[131:00.61]Stop it.
[131:00.87]Stop this.
[131:01.11]Stop.
[131:01.41]Stop.
[131:30.82]I don't- I shot the body on the floor last time.
[131:33.24]Do I have any of the- Oh, gas!
[131:35.08]Alright, I think that's it.
[131:37.19]Oh, shit!
[131:38.17]Wait, was I not- I went- I flashed everybody.
[132:01.19]The one time when a team flashes what you're supposed to do.
[132:05.48]Really?
[132:05.72]Okay.
[132:05.86]Puzzle solved.
[132:06.58]I want to say a very special thank you.
[132:25.57]The jermaOn at five for flashing the fucking team.
[132:28.39]Calling them mistakes as opposed to willful disregard of human life due to my generous nature.
[132:33.84]However, I'm not so generous as to allow undisciplined officers to jeopardize the safety of this element with flagrant acts.
[132:41.55]What training involves team flashbang?
[132:43.49]What?
[132:43.65]What?
[132:43.79]Oh, please.
[132:44.42]Yeah, what am I supposed to do?
[132:46.18]Okay.
[133:12.07]So what- I think I know what I gotta do.
[133:21.75]I gotta like shoot him in the leg.
[133:27.78]I'm gonna shoot him like- I'm gonna shoot him in the leg.
[133:32.16]I di- okay shoot- What the fuck are you talking about?
[133:40.66]What?
[133:44.76]Lieutenant?
[133:46.66]The events of today were tragic.
[133:48.96]Some of your fellow officers were seriously- Alright, hold on.
[133:56.38]Wait.
[133:56.72]No, I was gonna say flash out or something.
[133:58.52]I'm gonna say I'm gonna flash him.
[134:00.04]One down.
[134:01.22]Flash going in.
[134:02.06]Where's flash?
[134:08.34]Down closet five.
[134:10.68]Gas.
[134:11.32]High ground.
[134:11.88]In control.
[134:12.70]What?
[134:12.86]I don't know.
[134:16.41]I'm supposed to interview the lady.
[134:20.59]High ground.
[134:29.64]I have the high ground.
[134:31.18]Get cover.
[134:31.80]Nobody listens.
[134:46.41]alright well flash before entering the room well good luck I have like one second here I can't even do it no I like I have one second what the is going on here what am I doing
[135:16.53]Why am I getting arrested?
[135:21.47]What did I do?
[135:23.76]Your training and hard work paid off today.
[135:26.24]We have our suspect in custody.
[135:27.65]Am I the suspect?
[135:29.79]As with every call-up, today's situation proved we can never truly know what a suspect will do.
[135:35.69]It was me.
[135:36.67]I was the fucking bad guy.
[135:38.55]As we've learned, we can know our tactics, our jobs, and our mission.
[135:42.69]These are advantages we have.
[135:44.67]Today, we had a few mistakes.
[135:46.63]I'm calling them mistakes as opposed to willful disregard of human life due to my generous nature.
[135:52.32]However...
[135:53.44]I'm not so generous as to allow undisciplined officers to jeopardize the safety of this element with flagrant acts.
[136:00.02]We were the villain the whole time.
[136:01.54]I'm placing you under probation status.
[136:03.96]Your actions in the field today... You know what?
[136:07.73]Like, who fucking cares?
[136:12.61]I've been waiting for you.
[136:13.67]Oh, no.
[136:14.11]I'm lifting your probation status.
[136:15.63]Oh, that was quick.
[136:16.67]They're willing to give you another chance.
[136:18.97]They think you have potential.
[136:20.59]Personally, I think the jury's still out.
[136:22.69]However, I'm willing to go with the team consensus.
[136:25.30]Just keep in mind I'm watching your every move.
[136:28.02]From this point forward, you're to adhere to the procedure and tactics of this platoon.
[136:32.64]If not, you're on patrol duty in the harbor area.
[136:35.24]I love how it took the car ride home.
[136:38.86]The car ride home was enough probation, apparently.
[136:44.05]Okay.
[136:46.35]Sure.
[136:47.05]That sounds like a plan.
[136:50.01]Yeah, it got real serious because it got real loud.
[136:55.32]Actually, I'm intrigued now.
[136:57.38]Turn the call volume down?
[136:58.76]There is nothing I can do about it.
[137:00.22]You fail again.
[137:01.26]You're back on Lucy.
[137:01.84]Okay.
[137:13.63]What do you mean, yes there is?
[137:17.06]Well if you'll excuse me, sir.
[137:18.50]Certainly.
[137:18.98]I believe you'll find Saunders downrange already set up.
[137:22.34]Hey JD.
[137:25.62]Hey.
[137:26.48]I turned the volume up to full.
[137:28.74]How about if I spot for you?
[137:29.80]That'd be great, thanks.
[137:34.13]The volume is at zero.
[137:36.13]Center hit.
[137:37.17]Begin top left to right.
[137:39.17]Load your rifle.
[137:39.91]This is volume and call-ups.
[137:43.53]That isn't the volume.
[137:46.40]Call volume, like, it's at, look at, look at, this is where it is.
[137:49.64]Doesn't even matter.
[137:50.22]The sliders don't do anything.
[137:51.20]What do you think call-ups are?
[138:01.15]I don't know.
[138:02.21]Increases the call-up time.
[138:05.91]We'll watch it, what, ready?
[138:08.55]Oh, you guys all think I'm fucking stupid?
[138:10.27]This is at, this is at low as it can go.
[138:12.53]We'll see what happens.
[138:14.21]Let's take a look.
[138:16.35]Let's take a listen.
[138:20.47]Let's leave.
[138:21.13]Let's leave.
[138:22.33]I'll be right back.
[138:28.15]Everybody thinks I'm such a fucking brilliant person.
[138:30.90]Let's find out.
[138:31.48]Here you go.
[138:40.52]Let's find out.
[138:41.92]Everyone's calling me out on this shit.
[138:43.93]Let's see what happens.
[138:45.05]Everyone's screaming at me.
[138:46.03]Let's click on this guy and see what happens.
[138:48.29]How do acute angles affect bullet trajectory?
[138:50.19]Good question.
[139:03.95]Now, when a target is at an elevated or depressed angle from the shooter and no correction factor is applied, the bullet will strike higher than the point of aim.
[139:14.50]Now, here at the range and in most shooting situations we in law enforcement find ourselves, this effect will be slight.
[139:22.05]However, I'm willing to admit that I was wrong.
[139:25.41]Alright, hold on.
[139:26.23]Here's what I'm going to try.
[139:29.05]I'm going to do this.
[139:32.25]I'm going to drop my master volume and turn the game volume up.
[139:38.96]That's all I can do.
[139:39.66]It's not going to matter.
[139:40.24]It's not going to matter.
[139:51.20]It's going to be impossible, but whatever.
[139:53.52]I can turn this down and then turn it up, but I don't think it's going to help.
[140:04.17]It's just awful fucking sound mixing, unfortunately, guys.
[140:07.19]I wish there was more I could do.
[140:08.13]Let's see if that does anything.
[140:11.65]Putting call-ups back to where they belong.
[140:13.61]I had to prove my point.
[140:19.17]It's been proven.
[140:20.39]Also, somebody gave money, too.
[140:21.62]A lot of money.
[140:24.82]Bijari to man, again.
[140:26.30]Gave $50.
[140:26.42]$150 total from BJ.
[140:26.94]Says, I'm so bored.
[140:34.98]Well, thank you, dude.
[140:37.09]That's $150 that I now have.
[140:39.95]Thank you so much.
[140:40.61]Appreciate it.
[140:43.05]Completely unnecessary, but also appreciated.
[140:47.33]EFS also gave $10.
[140:48.47]I want to say thank you.
[140:49.43]I'm coming off a surgery today.
[140:51.08]Your streams really lifted me up.
[140:53.04]Well, thank you, dude.
[140:55.14]Hopefully your surgery went well.
[140:56.70]Hopefully you recover very swiftly.
[140:59.28]And then Jenbetters gave $5.
[141:01.90]It's your birthday yesterday, and I was hoping I could give you big bigs yesterday, but you didn't stream.
[141:07.67]I can't hang around much today, but here's some money for you.
[141:09.81]Thanks for the years of amazing content, and you never fail to amuse me.
[141:12.19]Well, thank you, Jen.
[141:14.37]Thank you so much.
[141:15.19]Happy birthday, by the way.
[141:17.49]Another year older, another year wiser.
[141:20.09]Thank you so much.
[141:24.51]Why am I still playing this game?
[141:27.36]What happened?
[141:30.29]Why am I still playing?
[141:31.45]Body mask.
[141:33.96]Spotter confirming miss.
[141:35.74]Miss.
[141:37.74]Human silhouette up.
[141:39.00]Body mask.
[141:40.02]Spotter confirming called body strike.
[141:43.40]I don't know why.
[141:44.52]I don't know why, guys.
[141:46.84]What am I doing?
[141:48.06]Body mask.
[141:50.65]You wonky ass piece of shit game.
[141:53.03]Spotter confirming called body... Body mask.
[141:58.03]Spotter...
[141:59.78]Where's my call up?
[142:00.58]Let's go.
[142:00.96]Go play Bunker?
[142:02.32]No, fuck that.
[142:03.22]Here we go.
[142:03.58]We got a call!
[142:06.28]Here we go.
[142:06.90]The game crashed.
[142:38.19]Well, thank you everybody for watching.
[142:44.78]What a fitting ending.
[142:46.74]That's it, that's gonna be it.
[142:51.86]Yeah, I mean, I've been going for like four and a half hours now.
[142:56.49]I did have fun, though.
[142:57.29]I mean, the game is a fucking piece of crap, but it's okay.
[143:02.39]I enjoyed my time on both games, but thank you guys.
[143:06.84]Thank you for sticking around as long as you did.
[143:08.16]Good thing we spent 10 minutes on the volume.
[143:11.84]I know, really.
[143:19.33]I know, really.
[143:27.25]Wait, somebody gave money and I didn't see it?
[143:28.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[143:30.12]Kusama, where?
[143:30.98]What happened?
[143:31.76]You gave money earlier?
[143:38.92]Oh, you did.
[143:39.42]Did I not say hello?
[143:40.20]I thought I did.
[143:40.64]I thought I said, hey, Kusama.
[143:43.06]Kusama, thanks for the $5.
[143:44.22]Appreciate it.
[143:45.91]Much appreciated.
[143:46.57]And Rascal.
[143:48.61]Rascal just gave $5, too.
[143:50.47]Lots of, like, $5 tonight.
[143:52.63]You guys are fucking giving me money.
[143:57.91]Thank you.
[144:06.39]Wouldn't be a stream without 30% of the time fixing technical stuff.
[144:09.13]Well, the first game was not like that.
[144:10.55]But that, you know, obviously that game came out like a couple years ago.
[144:14.43]Or did it?
[144:14.78]I have no idea.
[144:15.42]That game was dumb.
[144:17.80]But... Fighting Grandma was fun for a little while.
[144:24.53]But yeah, take care guys.
[144:25.37]I'll see you tomorrow.
[144:27.44]Tomorrow, we're going to step away from the full motion video games.
[144:33.32]We've been doing that for the last few days now.
[144:36.19]The last few streams at least.
[144:41.41]And there's going to be something fun tomorrow.
[144:45.43]I can at least assure you that there'll be one joke tomorrow that's worth it.
[144:50.75]There's going to be one real worth it joke.
[144:53.83]That's all I got to say.
[144:55.92]uh good night good rest good rest of you good luck to you good night much love and see you tomorrow
[145:32.46]Thank you.
