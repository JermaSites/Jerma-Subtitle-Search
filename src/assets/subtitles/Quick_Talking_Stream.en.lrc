[03:30.78]What's on your face?
[03:32.70]What is it?
[03:35.10]What is this?
[03:37.16]What is this?
[03:41.81]By the way, look at this outfit.
[03:45.47]I've lost complaint control at this point.
[03:47.21]You know what I mean?
[03:48.23]Look at the hat.
[03:49.18]I've got like Dr. Pepper and I've got like pajamas on.
[03:51.60]I've got like pajama pants.
[03:56.64]I really am like a fucking 45 year old.
[04:05.31]That's how I dress.
[04:05.97]That's how I dress.
[04:07.05]People think I'm... Hold on.
[04:08.81]I gotta get away from Ernest.
[04:10.03]We gotta go more... There we go.
[04:11.61]There we go.
[04:12.03]Okay, cool.
[04:16.63]Vegas Knights?
[04:17.45]Yeah.
[04:17.87]I've... I'm such a... I'm such a fucking piece of shit.
[04:21.60]You know why?
[04:23.78]How many Vegas Golden Knights games do you think I've been to since moving to Vegas?
[04:29.12]How many?
[04:32.09]None.
[04:32.65]That's right.
[04:33.19]Correct.
[04:33.83]Ding, ding, ding.
[04:35.63]Absolute zero.
[04:40.49]Turn it backwards.
[04:50.40]Oh, wow.
[04:50.82]I just de-aged again.
[04:51.88]This kind of hurts, though.
[04:56.62]This is fellow kids.
[04:58.70]Yeah, it is.
[05:01.75]This hurts my forehead.
[05:03.25]No, I don't like it.
[05:04.09]That reminds me of VR, and I don't have very much left in the front, so I don't want to do that.
[05:08.01]It reminds me of VR helmet.
[05:15.99]Uh, so what are we doing today?
[05:17.25]Well, nothing.
[05:18.39]I've got about 40 minutes.
[05:20.49]I figured if we look at the dog, we'd have a coffee.
[05:23.13]We'd talk about a few things.
[05:24.73]A few important things.
[05:26.43]This is new, by the way.
[05:27.59]So it's not, I don't, have you noticed I haven't been punching you in the face on stream anymore?
[05:32.15]You notice that I haven't been just like absolutely just hammering your head?
[05:34.89]Because I used to have a big one of these that was just stuck out and it was a big pop filter.
[05:39.11]Not anymore.
[05:41.69]And now I have this little one that still works pretty well.
[05:45.17]A couple things.
[05:46.63]This weekend, probably on...
[05:51.50]Probably Monday.
[05:52.22]Either Sunday or Monday.

[06:04.24]Probably ten days.
[06:05.79]At least.
[06:06.87]So, I'm not going to be able to announce when the voting is going to happen.
[06:11.39]But the nominations are in.
[06:13.65]That's closed.
[06:14.95]And voting is going to begin this coming week.
[06:18.01]And I'm not going to be able to tell you, hey, by the way...
[06:21.19]Go vote.

[06:23.11]So this is a preemptive go vote on that poll.
[06:26.31]So share this clip of me talking about this to all your friends that know that they want to vote because it's going to be coming next week.
[06:32.97]And I'm not going to be there to tell you about it.

[09:47.48]I don't have a gun.
[09:50.82]It's in a game.
[09:51.50]It's like a thing.
[09:52.38]Look, I do a thing in the video game.
[09:54.52]Just look up the video.
[09:55.32]It's called Secret Pancake Recipe.

[10:15.86]I got an announcement to make.
[10:18.42]I have an announcement to make for you.
[10:23.20]So, well, it's more like an announcement of an announcement.
[10:27.08]But it's an announcement that things are coming to this thing that people were really into.
[10:32.08]So you guys remember FTK?
[10:35.75]Fuck the king.
[10:36.15]A couple of experiments we tried to do.
[10:38.41]Tried to get like a thousand people in a server.
[10:40.17]And it was an experiment, right?
[10:42.59]It was an experiment.
[10:43.47]It was an experiment.
[10:44.49]It was fun.
[10:45.75]It was an experiment.
[10:46.35]It was fun.
[10:47.37]So FTK has been killed.
[10:52.49]The king is dead.
[10:55.03]And from the ashes in the king's grave is going to rise.
[11:01.21]You ready?
[11:02.95]An official GermaCraft server for Minecraft where you can go and hang out with your friends and build all kinds of fun stuff.
[11:09.89]And there's going to be like a survival.
[11:10.89]There's going to be like a bunch of cool stuff.
[11:12.07]There's going to be a map you can try to walk around.
[11:13.89]There's going to be a full-on community Minecraft server that will exist forever.
[11:20.64]It looks fucking awesome.
[11:23.50]It's currently a work in progress.
[11:25.68]It looks awesome.
[11:29.28]I will share some things with you soon.
[11:33.03]But I wanted to give an update on that.
[11:35.41]It's going to be, the base is going to be just vanilla Minecraft.
[11:40.08]There'll probably be some additions later.
[11:42.08]As we add stuff to it.
[11:44.52]But FTK is just becoming a Minecraft server.
[11:48.14]That you guys, it'll be broken up into a bunch of different world maps.
[11:51.70]And the hub world looks incredible.
[11:54.77]I cannot tell you how awesome it looks.
[11:56.13]You'll see pretty soon.
[11:59.11]We just get subs?
[12:00.81]Mystic Quest, thanks for the five community subs.
[12:04.72]It was really loud.
[12:05.42]And like, my chair shocked me.
[12:11.20]Tuber voice.
[12:11.76]That wasn't even a tuber voice.
[12:12.80]That was a chewing gum from the 90s commercial voice.
[12:17.00]There were 45 different flavors!
[12:20.24]Whoa!
[12:25.30]Uh, Freddy's... What the fuck?
[12:29.78]Freddie Dredd just gave 50 subs.
[12:31.85]The last two days has been like just sub the, just like sub the fuck out of me.
[12:37.01]That's 50.
[12:39.01]Freddie.
[12:40.53]Oh my God, dude.
[12:45.18]Cry, cry, cry, cry.
[12:46.96]There's been like 2000 subs in 48 hours.
[12:50.60]Something insane.
[12:54.77]Sing the cry song.
[13:00.06]How do you sing the cry song?
[13:01.84]I don't know what that means.
[13:07.91]He's in a new tax bracket.
[13:12.27]Smash the hand.
[13:15.11]Sing it, coward.
[13:17.35]Come over here, coward.
[13:18.03]Come over here, coward.
[13:19.93]Hey, you flipped me off.
[13:25.31]Jeremy, please.
[13:25.97]Give me some questions.
[13:27.69]Give me some questions for me for another 20 minutes before I leave.
[13:35.85]No taxes on bits.
[13:41.17]I don't think you know how that works.
[13:43.23]But, it's okay.
[13:49.48]Hold on a minute.
[13:50.68]We've got another five immunity subs.
[13:55.59]From xsparta45.
[13:56.77]Thanks, xsparta.
[13:57.75]This is just continuing from last night, I feel.
[13:59.88]Hey, nice to see you.
[14:01.70]Nice to see you, too.
[14:06.84]Get that gross thing off there.
[14:11.99]Do some ASMR, okay?
[14:17.81]People are going to freak out if I do that.
[14:24.60]This kind of looks like a pineapple upside down cake.
[14:28.42]You know what I mean, doesn't it?
[14:30.02]Oh, no, another one.
[14:32.22]I'm literally sitting here drinking coffee.
[14:35.28]I don't deserve this amount of money.
[14:38.32]I do not deserve this.
[14:40.02]I just made a coffee and put a fucking Vegas Golden Knights hat on and sat down and told you about a Minecraft server.
[14:46.30]Somebody said 25 subs.
[14:47.76]Who was that?
[14:54.62]Who just gave the 25 subs?
[14:56.18]That was a 25 and then 5.
[14:57.34]4, but just came in with 5.
[14:59.66]Who just gave 25 subs?
[15:04.31]What the fuck is going on?
[15:05.55]Is this going to turn off?
[15:09.57]This is still going from last night.
[15:14.19]Who just gave the 25?
[15:15.87]Hold on.
[15:18.32]Can I take a sip of this fucking coffee?
[15:20.92]I'm just holding it like a wax museum.
[15:23.12]Just like...
[15:28.48]Will the Minecraft server be sub only?
[15:31.06]No, but you're going to have to get whitelisted.
[15:33.26]You'll get whitelisted through the Discord.
[15:35.26]So no one's going to have to pay to play here.
[15:38.20]But you're going to have to get whitelisted through the Discord.
[15:41.27]So no, there's not going to be a sub requirement at all.
[15:43.81]But there will be a Discord whitelisting requirement.
[15:47.95]uh no I don't have people have to pay for that like every time I think about that I'm like no that's stupid I don't want to do that like oh you got to have five dollars it's five look it's five dollars a month to pay if I did that let's say it was five dollars a month for you to play on that server and you don't even like care you just want to you just want to play in the minecraft server the hosting for that server it would be I that would be way more money taking in than I should be taking in so
[16:17.06]No, that's, I don't, why would I do that?
[16:20.92]A penis, whatever.
[16:21.96]Uh, you should get a, you should get a nose job.
[16:27.48]You think so?
[16:27.80]Yeah, I know.
[16:32.97]It's like, it goes like this.
[16:34.79]It's all broken and shit.
[16:35.65]No, I don't care.
[16:36.31]This is how God made me.
[16:37.03]I don't give a fuck.
[16:40.55]This is how God made me.
[16:43.27]He, like, started sketching.
[16:45.23]You know, he got about to be right here.
[16:47.89]Somebody, like, grabbed his attention.
[16:50.43]God, there's an earthquake.
[16:51.65]What?
[16:51.97]And he, like, smudged with his pencil.
[16:53.96]Oh, hold on.
[16:54.54]I'll fix that later.
[16:55.56]He got down to, like, here.
[16:57.38]He, like, sneezed.
[16:59.52]Oh, shit.
[17:00.38]That's all right.
[17:00.98]This is how I made him.
[17:05.66]That looks okay.
[17:07.54]Then he got to about here.
[17:09.81]And he's like, you know what?
[17:11.41]Let's make a big mouth.
[17:14.03]I was his funny character creator.
[17:16.35]You don't think God made you into a character creator?
[17:26.13]Hey, I'm listening to this at work.
[17:29.11]Okay, well, be careful.
[17:30.19]I don't want you to get fired or anything.
[17:31.33]You're at work.
[17:33.18]I don't want your boss to come over and be like, what the fuck is this guy?
[17:37.58]Oh, shit.
[17:38.24]Hey.

[17:53.48]So, I mean, I'm working here, remote.
[17:55.96]You're there.
[17:57.18]And, yeah, it'll be, the work that I have for you will be done soon.
[18:02.11]Because you're like above me, way more than I do.
[18:04.89]You do so much more work than me.
[18:09.30]I'm just really happy that I have somebody like you that I can kind of communicate with.
[18:12.36]That can help me get work done for the boss.
[18:15.44]Uh, because he's like fucking... He sucks.
[18:20.66]He is such a fucking loser.
[18:23.58]Like, I know you guys, like, I know you like him.
[18:25.36]Like, you like him and you think he's like really cool and smart and funny and stuff.
[18:29.83]He fucking sucks, dude.
[18:30.95]And I don't even care if I get like, I don't know.
[18:33.01]If he ever hears this, like, whatever.
[18:35.58]Like, you stick up for him all the time, which is like, I kind of, I find fucking annoying.
[18:39.18]But, whatever.
[18:39.84]I don't think he's, I think, I don't think he's, I think he's an idiot.
[18:48.73]You got that guy fired.
[18:50.39]No, I didn't.
[18:51.85]The boss is peering over with like his glasses looking down.
[18:55.25]And he hears like, oh, you like him.
[18:56.61]And like, I'm sorry, I'm like, fuck him.
[18:58.25]But like, I know you stand up for him.
[18:59.51]He stands up for me?
[19:03.14]I'll remember that.
[19:06.75]Stalling.
[19:08.55]This is a stall stream.
[19:09.67]There's nothing to stall to.
[19:12.98]Are you Ellis from Left 4 Dead?
[19:18.62]Oh, shit.
[19:23.20]I mean, a little.
[19:30.16]Stall 2 for the Whopper stream.

[19:38.01]What does Ellis talk like?
[19:39.86]Oh, man.
[19:40.48]It's me, Ellis.
[19:41.12]I'm just hanging out here with my gun.
[19:43.24]I don't know nothing about that.
[19:44.86]How does he talk?
[19:45.22]Is that how he talks?
[19:53.75]I haven't played the game in like fucking four years.
[20:05.38]What about Community Content Night?
[20:06.73]Oh, alright, we can talk about that.
[20:09.03]So, Community Content Night is, like FTK, also dead.
[20:15.93]Sad to say.
[20:18.33]The reason is because the Twitch DMCA shit, there is no reliable way I can show videos like that on stream in a row.
[20:30.24]Uh, unfortunately, all the best, like, possibilities, like, in Harry Potter, I, you know, think about it, right?
[20:40.25]I sat in front of a green screen and said, put this in the Saw movie.
[20:44.15]Put, hey, look, I'm a Harry Potter character.
[20:47.15]You can't really do that anymore.
[20:50.81]Um, and I don't want to have insane heavy restrictions on it because I feel like the best videos are when you guys do whatever the fuck you want.
[20:57.08]So I wouldn't want to be like, uh, it's going to be the original background, original music, uh, only original character and only like an original foreground.
[21:03.80]And, uh, you go, good luck.
[21:06.10]By the way, I've said, I say Harry Potter in this clip 35 times.
[21:09.67]Good luck.
[21:10.81]No idea how you're going to do that.
[21:13.38]So that's just not going to happen anymore.
[21:16.58]And it's sad to say it, but that was about a full half of those streams.
[21:24.53]So the idea, and I don't know, I think this is okay for me to say, the idea is maybe to make a mega playlist with the videos.
[21:36.30]A huge one, a mega one.
[21:38.70]And queue it up in the Discord.
[21:42.45]And just have a night where we just, in the Discord, it's just playing and we're all there.
[21:48.34]Somehow.
[21:49.40]I'm trying to figure out what to do about it.
[21:51.04]Kind of like a watch party, essentially, in Discord.
[21:55.48]Because we can't do it here.
[21:58.20]And I don't really want to do it on YouTube either because YouTube also has the same problems.
[22:01.60]And I don't really want to stream on YouTube because I don't want to do that.
[22:06.04]What the fuck is a Discord?
[22:08.35]It's a service where you can get online and talk to friends.
[22:10.93]It's like Skype, but way better.
[22:13.51]It's just a way better version of Skype.
[22:15.63]There you go.
[22:22.33]Disc or Mega LOL.
[22:23.81]Okay, whatever.
[22:25.29]But the artwork is essentially started to transition into the BRB screen.
[22:30.83]And I know there's some kinks to work out.
[22:33.35]There's things that we have to figure out how I'm going to do that.
[22:36.15]Because I think after talking to Lazy Luke, that the backlog of art is still slowly kind of getting chipped away at.
[22:46.63]And I would have to do more BRBs.
[22:50.82]But I don't know if I necessarily want to do that.
[22:54.38]I don't think I want to have to be like, all right, I got to take a break.
[22:56.52]I got to take a break now.
[22:57.94]Because if I don't take a break now, let's do like a five-minute break.
[23:00.84]I'll see you later so we can show art.
[23:03.41]Although, like, I could do it at the end of streams.
[23:07.58]But the problem with doing it at the end of a stream is I am doing the thing that I deliberately removed like four or five months ago, where we hang out and sit there for half an hour, 20, 15, 20, 30, 40 minutes, and we do a post-stream wind down, and I got rid of that deliberately.
[23:23.89]So that's not going to happen.
[23:25.63]So what could happen is during, I guess, I could do either like an art stream.
[23:33.50]But the thing about doing an art stream is that's just community content night.
[23:37.48]And community content night had the videos and it was like a big thing.
[23:39.76]It was like, oh, we're going to do the art.
[23:40.74]Then we're going to do the videos.
[23:41.80]We're going to do the music.
[23:43.18]And it just sucks that we can't do it all.
[23:47.13]Could do pre-stream too.
[23:49.21]That could be a thing during the planets, right?
[23:52.36]Where it's... And then in the corner for like, you know, five to ten minutes is... Or like big enough, obviously, the starting soon would be in the corner.
[24:00.95]Do that.
[24:01.35]Have it run during the starting soon screen.
[24:04.01]I think that makes sense too.
[24:07.90]He's flustered by a little because it's annoying that I have to, I have to remove and delete essentially one of my favorite things on the entire channel, which was like the green screen community, not content night stuff that like that shit was fucking hilarious.
[24:21.09]So it's annoying that one of my favorite things essentially has to go away.
[24:28.39]I just rambled for a little while, but you know, I haven't talked, we have not talked about this yet.
[24:31.70]So
[24:36.55]Do it on YouTube?
[24:37.45]Yeah, I don't want to do it on YouTube.
[24:39.09]No.
[24:39.23]They say the same problems.
[24:43.51]I like the rambling.
[24:45.43]Well, good.
[24:45.79]I'm glad.
[24:49.10]Cheers to you.
[24:49.58]I don't know why I did that.
[24:52.52]That probably hurt.
[24:53.26]I'm really sorry.
[24:54.02]I just like did that inside of your ear.
[25:02.75]Ramble Andy.
[25:05.73]Go to mixer.
[25:06.71]That's funny.
[25:15.73]Go back to gaslighting.
[25:19.25]You wanna see the dog again?
[25:19.97]Oh, what I was gonna say about the dog.
[25:21.73]So he pulls the blankets off and lies over on next to the bed sometimes.
[25:26.11]It's like he prefers, he's such a Goldilocks dog, sometimes he prefers a soft bed.
[25:30.56]And other times he prefers like a hard ground.
[25:35.73]It's 50-50.
[25:36.39]I have no idea.
[25:37.26]He sees Goldilocks.
[25:38.86]No, no.
[25:39.12]He's the Goldilocks bears all in one animal.
[25:42.10]That's more accurate.
[25:45.28]So, anybody got any more questions?
[25:49.90]This is just a question stream.
[25:51.14]I'll answer anything.
[25:53.04]I will answer anything.
[25:54.52]You could write anything as long as it was TOS friendly.
[25:56.62]I would answer literally any question.
[25:57.83]What is it?
[26:00.81]What's your name?
[26:01.25]Jeremy.
[26:01.65]Done.
[26:02.15]Easy.
[26:03.67]Will you marry me?
[26:04.27]No.
[26:06.49]uh would you do I poop of course I do that's part of my digestive system all humans do of course can I have no how's your day it's going pretty good it's going well it's going very good will I make it through my audit
[26:25.13]Um, yeah, just make sure you play by the rules and make sure you give all the documents and, and, um, and work with the, uh, you know, you can work with the IRS somehow, maybe.
[26:35.81]I think, yeah, you'll be good.
[26:40.52]Do you drink Dr. Pepper?
[26:41.62]I have not had a sip of Dr. Pepper in probably like four or five months.
[26:45.02]And then before that, it was probably a couple of years.
[26:47.90]I just wear it because I like the shirt and I, it's an, I'm an old fan.
[26:53.58]Pirates, knights, or cowboys?
[27:00.08]Pirates for fun, knights for protection, and cowboys for... No, no, this is not like a sexual thing.
[27:13.27]What are you talking about?
[27:16.88]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[27:18.12]I'm talking, like, pirates are, like, if I was on a pirate ship, it'd be, like, we sing songs and, like, drink and sail.
[27:25.79]A knight has, like, a huge, can protect you.
[27:27.83]They got, like, a sword and a shield and stuff.
[27:30.75]A cowboy, um, for food.
[27:34.05]A cowboy for food.
[27:35.53]If I want to be, have a lot of food.
[27:37.07]Because they're, like, they can get, they're cowboys, right?
[27:42.66]I don't know.
[27:43.10]Farmers?
[27:43.58]Cowboys?
[27:45.46]Cowboys used to have their own source of food.
[27:47.42]They had to get to hunt and stuff, right?
[27:53.00]They're not eating other cowboys.
[27:57.40]What's your favorite?
[27:58.13]What?
[27:59.89]Do you eat beans?
[28:00.85]I do.
[28:01.19]Refried beans are one of my favorite things.
[28:06.55]Any news on the D&D game?
[28:08.77]Star is currently working on his project, which is going very well.
[28:13.09]So we had a conversation that was just like, hey, whenever you do your project and do it as best you can, and then maybe later you'll be able to get heavy, heavy work on the German 985 one.
[28:26.10]He's got his thing going now.
[28:27.22]And I didn't want to be like, oh, hey, well, you're going to do mine.
[28:30.76]Forget about your project.
[28:32.38]No, it's going very well, so.
[28:36.00]Do I smell?
[28:36.73]Yeah.
[28:38.35]Do I smell bad?
[28:39.03]No.
[28:39.83]I do emanate some type of fragrance, though.
[28:41.85]What's your opinion?
[28:47.69]I missed it.
[28:51.96]Fucking door spring behind you.
[28:55.78]This thing?
[28:56.14]How would you even pick that up?
[29:06.28]Touch it.
[29:06.82]Go flick it.
[29:08.56]Okay, fine.
[29:19.69]You happy?
[29:20.15]You made a loud noise too.
[29:34.39]I forgot.
[29:34.91]You can't, like, on Twitch, you have to just be a torso.
[29:39.39]You cannot, people cannot know that you have anything below the torso.
[29:44.05]See, and now Otto's annoyed.
[29:45.15]I just, like, I did that thing, and he's like, fucking, what the fuck, dude?
[29:48.98]I was sleeping.
[29:51.02]You did that.
[29:51.68]I didn't.
[29:54.90]You have to just be a floating upper body.
[29:59.37]When's German Rumble 2020?
[30:00.13]New Year's Eve.
[30:01.89]Oh, hello.
[30:02.33]New Year's Eve.
[30:06.41]Why do I look like a college kid?
[30:07.55]Because I have a hat on.
[30:08.43]You want me to take it off and be Jeremy again?
[30:12.17]Sure.
[30:12.57]Alright.
[30:13.15]Whatever.
[30:13.41]I don't even need the hat anymore.
[30:14.25]Who cares?
[30:18.70]Boomer.
[30:20.52]Maybe a little.
[30:25.12]Your hair looks small.
[30:26.10]Oh, it's
[30:39.76]I look like I was trying to hold in a fart right there, and I promise I wasn't.
[30:42.36]I just was doing that.
[30:43.04]I don't know why.
[30:48.14]Do a wink.
[30:48.76]That was Robert De Niro.
[31:00.03]Easiest impression ever.
[31:00.97]Just, like, brush your face a little bit and tilt your head around.
[31:09.10]Any chance of, man, I missed it.
[31:10.12]What is that?
[31:10.88]Any chance of, any chance of, when are you going to collab with Nanners?
[31:17.72]What the fuck was that?
[31:18.54]Uh, when am I going to collab with Nanners?
[31:20.82]Nanners is, um, Nanners is very funny.
[31:25.45]Uh, I don't know.
[31:26.85]I don't know.
[31:27.39]We kind of did last night.
[31:29.75]We were like, sent the clip thing.
[31:32.65]Uh,
[31:39.16]We went back and forth with clips on stream.
[31:43.63]Mind playing Jet Set Radio for a stream?
[31:45.41]I did and I fucking couldn't do it.
[31:46.91]I couldn't do it.
[31:47.91]I freaked out.
[31:55.17]Do a slime stream.
[31:56.21]I know.
[31:56.59]There's so many things that I want to do and I just didn't.
[32:01.66]You gonna be a VTuber?
[32:04.28]Would I make a good VTuber?
[32:05.32]I don't know.
[32:07.44]Probably not.
[32:16.66]Christmas stream.
[32:20.26]Not this year.
[32:22.30]New Year's stream.
[32:27.80]Uh... Nianers believed you could do it.
[32:33.17]Well, that's a huge endorsement.
[32:36.01]What would I... How would I do... I don't know.
[32:37.75]What about German Direct?
[32:46.85]um I don't have much to show besides the new year's eve thing in the minecraft thing it'd be like a blizzcon 2019 people would be mad at me oh but I gotta charge like 400 a ticket though will you what what does it say
[33:14.80]If you do, Mr. Slime, let me do it.
[33:17.92]I have no idea what I would even do.
[33:20.70]I would have to get something blocked out of my brain first before I even took that step.
[33:25.42]But somebody just gave a shitload of money.
[33:29.39]That was Chef Lazarus for 25 subs.
[33:32.77]So many subs.
[33:33.91]I think we broke it.
[33:34.89]Did we break it?
[33:38.72]Let's see.
[33:42.16]I think it's an all-time high.
[33:43.10]Let's see.
[33:51.79]I think we did it.
[33:53.97]When I say we, I mean you, because I'm just receiving this, and so sometimes I don't know why.
[34:01.14]The channel has broken 11,000 subscribers.
[34:04.46]Which is fucking ridiculous.
[34:09.25]I believe the all-time high is...
[34:15.46]Not very close to, I don't know.
[34:16.50]I don't like keep track of this, if I'm honest.
[34:19.50]I don't like want to keep track of this because I feel like then it becomes something I have to care about and I don't want that.
[34:25.93]So I don't really pay like that much attention to that.
[34:29.83]So that's a lot of fucking money.
[34:32.79]He doesn't care about gift subs.
[34:36.65]No, I do.
[34:37.59]I very much do.
[34:38.97]But I don't ever want that to be like a number that I like chase every day.
[34:45.73]And it's fluctuated a lot.
[34:46.95]I mean, it's gone.
[34:48.61]It has gone like wham, wham.
[34:50.87]My schedule is so erratic.
[34:52.83]I take a lot of breaks.
[34:53.89]I don't pay attention to that.
[34:55.37]I said the word subscriber and we talked about all.
[34:58.86]I shouldn't have even said it.
[35:00.56]But this is a lot of money.
[35:02.62]And I just don't want to pay that much attention to it.
[35:07.08]Chef Lazarus.
[35:09.00]Somebody just gave 50.
[35:09.88]Hold on.
[35:10.30]I got to pull this up.
[35:12.82]That's a lot of money.
[35:16.55]How much is, what did you just go?
[35:19.15]That was Wesley.
[35:20.27]Wesley gave 50 community subs.
[35:24.67]We broke it.
[35:25.25]We definitely broke it.
[35:26.25]So we don't have to do anymore.
[35:28.39]It's absolutely been broken.
[35:31.49]The stream is absolutely, this is a new subscriber high.
[35:35.64]Last time it happened was like this exact time period last year.
[35:43.52]That's insane.
[35:48.08]End of December into the first of January.
[35:50.21]That's what happened last time.
[35:52.69]Uh, but thanks guys.
[35:53.79]It's completely unnecessary.
[35:55.20]We don't have, you don't have, you don't have to give any more stuff.
[35:57.50]We don't have to do it anymore.
[35:58.52]Like you don't have to.
[35:59.60]That this is like already an insane number.
[36:02.31]And.
[36:04.05]We don't have to do like a sub train today.
[36:06.87]We don't have to do that.
[36:07.93]That doesn't have to happen.
[36:09.31]It doesn't have to happen.
[36:12.35]I don't need it to happen.
[36:13.40]I don't want you to do that.
[36:15.40]I know that I keep saying the words so people are going to do it.
[36:20.52]But I will tell you if you have other streamers that you watch
[36:27.57]I would rather you sub to them.
[36:30.91]I would rather you support a smaller streamer or a streamer that you enjoy, that you know might not have 11 fucking thousand subscriptions.
[36:40.03]You know what I'm saying?
[36:42.83]It's an incredibly overwhelming thing.
[36:45.05]I can't believe that this many people pay this much money.
[36:49.01]But if you have a choice between like a few different people and you know that I'm about to hit like fucking 12,000 subs...
[36:57.58]Support them.
[36:58.74]Because, you know, I would much prefer that.
[37:04.26]If you don't, but if it's just me, if it's just me, then all right.
[37:11.11]But, no, I'm kidding.
[37:16.69]He's doing reverse psychology.
[37:18.95]All right, well, then, okay.
[37:20.53]If I do regular, regular psychology, if I say do it, then that means you won't do it.
[37:33.95]There was a burp coming in.
[37:36.44]Um.
[37:37.68]I can't even count.
[37:38.32]There's so many that just came in.
[37:39.98]All five.
[37:40.48]Five.
[37:40.96]Fifty.
[37:41.80]Ten from Captain Dark.
[37:43.12]Five.
[37:43.50]Edgy Shadow.
[37:44.14]Five.
[37:44.46]Anonymous Gifted.
[37:45.12]This is the same exact thing happened yesterday.
[37:48.72]Now.
[37:49.10]And I want you.
[37:50.05]Another thing too.
[37:51.71]I. Especially like.
[37:54.81]Now.
[37:55.59]You know what I mean?
[37:56.07]Like 2020's been fucked.
[37:58.75]I'd rather you spend that money on like you, your friends, and your family than me.
[38:02.76]Um.
[38:04.49]Take care of yourselves.
[38:05.49]Make sure you do that first.
[38:07.23]Put me at the bottom of your fucking list.
[38:09.37]I really hope you are.
[38:11.87]Put me at the very bottom of your list of places where you think your money should be going.
[38:17.16]Take care of yourself.
[38:17.94]Take care of your family.
[38:18.64]Take care of your friends.
[38:22.02]Absolutely.
[38:23.88]It's been a fucking rough year.
[38:25.32]And I really hope that you guys are taking care of yourselves.
[38:35.87]Ban the subs.
[38:40.01]Jeremy, you're getting coal for Christmas.
[38:51.04]Are you going to finish Saw 2?
[38:53.99]Why would I finish Saw?
[38:57.03]Did you hear how much I was not having fun in that game?
[39:03.14]I'm not going to finish it.
[39:04.02]I'm not going to open Saw 2 again.
[39:05.94]I don't know where the disc is.
[39:07.34]I think I threw it away.
[39:11.32]Yes.
[39:11.72]Yeah, but that's... Behind you?
[39:20.61]I know, there's a dog behind me.
[39:28.05]Hot dog.
[39:31.05]Hot dog.
[39:34.72]Here he comes.
[39:37.86]Oh, big stretch.
[39:39.34]Oh, you missed it.
[39:42.81]I really, like, hate to do this, but, like, I've got to go in, like, a minute.
[39:47.15]Well, I think I'm just going to turn the stream on and, uh... Hey, everybody, turn... Just going live for, like, 40 minutes and collecting subs.
[39:57.29]Thanks, everybody.
[39:58.01]Appreciate, like, the fucking 600 subs that just came in.
[40:00.97]All right, see you later.
[40:01.87]40 minutes.
[40:03.71]You know, you see what I'm saying?
[40:04.63]You know what I mean?
[40:05.11]Like, I want to be real.

[48:00.10]It doesn't matter what's behind you.
[48:02.43]If you're a YouTuber or you're in a streamer room, the thing that's not really supposed to be in the room is you must have been zirking off somehow.
