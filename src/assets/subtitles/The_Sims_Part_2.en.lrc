[00:04.25]That's why we're gonna be playing more of The Sims 1, which is fun.
[00:10.03]And hopefully you guys understand what I just said.
[00:13.07]Uh... Oh, he pretended!
[00:19.38]He pretended that his mic has been muted the entire time he's been here!
[00:21.62]What do you mean one minute?
[00:24.28]Everyone needs to relax.
[00:28.26]Do a face reveal.
[00:32.46]I don't... I don't... Alright.
[00:35.11]Don't... Just don't feed into the trolls.
[00:37.31]That's what they are.
[00:37.77]They're trolls.
[00:39.67]Don't feed into the trolls.
[00:44.21]I'm not gonna play your game.
[00:45.43]I'm not gonna feed into the trolls.
[00:49.92]He's naked.
[00:50.50]I am.
[00:53.22]I might be the only streamer on this whole website that streams naked and won't get banned for it.
[01:09.79]Imagine they catch me on a technicality or something.
[01:15.48]Well, there's... Hold on, I gotta protect... Let me protect myself.
[01:18.68]Very quickly.
[01:20.18]I'm not naked.
[01:22.78]I'm just partially nude.
[01:26.35]The difference.
[01:29.11]No, I'm not in a bathtub, I promise.
[01:37.84]juggles juggles juggles yeah I'm like you can hear that he's in the bathroom we're gonna play more of The Sims one obviously I had a lot of fun with it gonna actually try to make real progress today I didn't burn a whole house down
[02:00.29]And leave a small child without parents.
[02:03.05]That was not my intention when I started the stream yesterday.
[02:09.16]Hope everybody's doing.
[02:09.80]I forgot to say well.
[02:12.94]Hope everybody's doing.
[02:14.70]I actually kind of like that.
[02:16.24]Hope you're doing.
[02:17.86]Hope everybody's doing.
[02:19.62]I like that.
[02:20.14]I think I'm going to use that.
[02:25.69]What y'all doing?
[02:27.76]Yeah, I like it.
[02:30.14]I think it's good.
[02:31.80]Did I tweet?
[02:39.12]Why are you live?
[02:41.18]Because I'm a streamer.
[02:44.14]Once a week streamer.
[02:45.66]Sorry about that.
[02:46.48]We fix that before we get started.
[02:53.26]Why say lot words?
[02:56.87]What?
[02:57.43]Why say lot word?
[02:58.73]Like, what am I saying?
[03:03.48]I don't know.
[03:06.52]It's either you guys or the wall, okay?
[03:10.64]If I did not have a stream to come on and just talk, I would likely just be pacing around and just, like, talking about, like, my favorite foods and stuff.
[03:22.41]I would call my mother.
[03:25.98]I would talk to my mother.
[03:26.70]I'd be like, I would talk to my mother like four or five times a week.
[03:31.32]Of course, by the way, I talk to my mother once a week.
[03:34.86]When was the last time you called your mother?
[03:38.82]Do it today.
[03:39.32]When was the last time you called your damn mother?
[03:44.54]She's waiting for your phone call.
[03:46.38]That's what you don't understand.
[03:53.32]Say hello.
[03:56.15]Call her right now.
[03:58.55]No, I'm not gonna do that to my mother.
[04:03.23]That's like a weird prank.
[04:06.47]Ring up my mom.
[04:07.63]Oh, hi, Jeremy.
[04:10.12]Oh, hey, mom.
[04:11.12]Hey, you're on stream.
[04:13.48]Like, oh, thanks for the call.
[04:15.20]You're using me as a prop.
[04:16.48]You're using me as a set piece.
[04:19.02]You're a fucking clown stream.
[04:20.40]Thank you.
[04:21.24]Good to hear from you, son.
[04:24.06]I'm not using my mother as a prop.
[04:26.75]for that one time when I had the dinner stream.
[04:30.59]And that was a disaster, so I'm not doing that again.
[04:32.15]Alright, you guys ready?
[04:36.53]Are we all here?
[04:37.05]I hope so.
[04:45.22]Are you here?
[04:45.54]Alright, so we left.
[04:50.36]How do we leave off?
[04:52.46]I'm excited.
[04:52.92]I like this game.
[04:54.78]It's very hard, but I like it.
[05:01.48]Okay.
[05:02.68]So we left off at... You're talking about... No, it wasn't.
[05:12.45]Hair reveal.
[05:13.25]Alright, you guys ready?
[05:17.21]You ruined an entire family and made a child insane.
[05:19.63]I'm... No, that's not what happened.
[05:20.79]Go adopt Caramel.
[05:27.24]I don't think I can do that.
[05:28.24]This is The Sims 1.
[05:33.33]You can't do that in The Sims 1.
[05:34.27]Okay, here we go.
[05:40.37]What was the last thing I was doing?
[05:43.46]This house is pretty sick, actually.
[05:44.78]I like this place.
[05:49.70]Friends.
[05:50.08]That's right, right, right.
[05:50.68]Friends.
[05:50.98]And I want to be a chef, too.
[05:53.30]Let's get some... Let me open up my fucking... Let's see what it is.
[06:02.17]I don't even care anymore.
[06:04.21]I'm just doing it on stream.
[06:11.60]And the acting career.
[06:12.36]That's right.
[06:14.42]Well, first things first.
[06:16.28]We go to sleep.
[06:22.20]That was Bugleberry.
[06:23.88]That sounded like Bugleberry.
[06:25.08]Where are the flies coming from?
[06:29.15]What's going on here?
[06:33.50]I'm leaving.
[06:34.10]We just got here.
[06:37.61]Oh, I get it.
[06:38.09]Okay.
[06:43.29]Get out of bed.
[06:43.91]It just took me like an hour to turn around and get out of the bed.
[06:52.69]Did I make that noise?
[06:55.62]It wouldn't be out of the ordinary.
[06:56.76]Yuck.
[07:01.42]I do that shit.
[07:11.04]Oh god, get the... Alright, water.
[07:13.25]Don't forget to do this.
[07:17.93]I think a lot of you guys severely underestimate just the amount of noises that I make on a daily basis.
[07:25.40]I'm not even, like, aware of it sometimes.
[07:26.76]I just kind of... It's like a... I'm doing, like, my own soundtrack.
[07:34.52]Oh, we know.
[07:37.40]Alright, let's go.
[07:37.90]I kind of don't even want these.
[07:44.42]I'd rather have statues.
[07:48.15]What's wrong?
[07:48.69]Oh, fun!
[07:49.55]Alright, go turn the TV, watch TV for a little while.
[07:52.71]And then we're going out on the town.
[07:58.69]I like to imagine you would do those noises at an inappropriate time, like at a funeral.
[08:05.31]Um, no.
[08:07.73]Sit down and watch the TV.
[08:15.20]Doi doi doi at the funeral.
[08:16.74]That would be so... Doi doi doi doi doi doi.
[08:30.96]No, that would be me giving the... Was it the eulogy?
[08:36.74]Do you canoe?
[08:37.62]Did he just prank me?
[08:41.68]No, that would be me giving the eulogy.
[08:43.66]And everybody at the funeral would all do it at the same time.
[08:46.72]To honor that person.
[08:48.14]Like, it would be me.
[08:49.32]Okay, if I'm dead...
[08:51.41]Whoever's doing the eulogy, if you're hearing this right now.
[08:53.88]You need to get the entire funeral session.
[08:59.66]To do the doy doy doy in unison.
[09:02.02]To honor me.
[09:09.52]And it has to be loud enough.
[09:11.68]So that at least one or two people in the church or wherever we are.
[09:17.25]Are holding their ears.
[09:19.55]Going like...
[09:30.51]Think about that in a church.
[09:32.35]How much that would just bounce off the walls.
[09:36.45]I think we might summon like a demon if we did that.
[09:38.81]That's probably how you do it.
[09:40.55]Just like... Stop it!
[09:44.46]Stop it!
[09:45.00]You're going to summon him!
[09:47.06]Don't, please!
[09:57.66]A demon.
[10:02.26]Penis music, that's right.
[10:03.93]That's gonna resurrect me.
[10:05.25]While people are doing that, I start slowly, like, lifting out of the coffin?
[10:11.80]That's terrifying.
[10:23.09]Alright, what do I need?
[10:23.73]Take a shower.
[10:24.39]Is this clean?
[10:24.89]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[10:25.93]Flush the toilet and clean it.
[10:28.19]This is so stupid.
[10:29.17]Can I, like, go into, like, a... Like, the text editor and make this not happen anymore?
[10:34.55]I understand that people can be slobs, but I've... I've never flushed the toilet.
[10:38.78]Like, that's not a personality trait.
[10:43.88]That's seriously not a personality trait.
[10:51.86]He's depressed.
[10:54.69]You've never flushed.
[10:55.37]No, I mean, like, you know what I mean?
[10:56.81]Like, I've never not flushed the toilet.
[11:02.19]He doesn't flush it for personal reasons.
[11:05.66]No, he just has, like, two neatness.
[11:10.32]And that apparently means you don't flush toilets.
[11:16.52]You're doing the doi doi thing muffled in the coffin.
[11:20.18]And that's the way to make everybody there.
[11:22.52]That's the way how people know they have to do it.
[11:23.98]They just hear like... He's in there!
[11:33.64]Everybody, let's do it!
[11:39.60]Okay, how many people would run out of there?
[11:42.72]That's like a we need to run out of here and get out.
[11:50.84]Oh, quick dinner.
[11:52.06]Quick dinner.
[11:52.50]Quick dinner.
[11:53.01]Don't serve... Don't just like have... Did I say... There we go.
[11:55.23]Yeah.
[11:57.25]Oh, I need a food processor too.
[11:58.41]I remember that.
[12:00.65]I remember that.
[12:01.29]Food processor.
[12:02.33]It makes the food better.
[12:06.30]Where is it?
[12:09.36]There it is.
[12:11.14]Where can I put this?
[12:12.36]Right there.
[12:16.56]Okay, those bills.
[12:17.92]I only have 1200 bucks.
[12:18.90]I need to go gamble some more.
[12:22.16]Things that you should never say.
[12:23.52]Okay, never mind.
[12:32.35]Will you stream your funeral?
[12:36.41]I don't know.
[12:36.69]We're kind of in like a weird world with that.
[12:38.83]Like, our generation is like the first generation that would probably think to do something like that, right?
[12:46.72]And when I say our generation, I mean 18 to 34.
[12:48.58]I'm not even in that.
[12:50.02]I'm not even there anymore, but I'm just going to pretend I am.
[12:57.26]I think we're the first ones that would actually do something like that.
[12:59.50]What is going on in this whole place like this?
[13:08.74]I thought...
[13:13.91]All these Okay, so the the the delivery person I have never taken these in so they've just started to play a game if they put it on each one of these I Didn't hear them blend in and he's like fuck it with me OCD mailman No, I think it's I have not taken them in ever.
[13:42.36]Oh
[13:43.73]So instead of just putting them in the same spot, they're just like, well, fuck it, whatever, I'm gonna have some fun.
[13:50.52]That's why that thing popped up and said that there's no more room.
[13:54.88]Okay, turn the cartoons off!
[13:58.95]Jeez!
[13:59.47]Is there any more?
[14:03.61]No, okay.
[14:07.17]Clean this up.
[14:08.25]And then I need to find, I need to get a chef job, right?
[14:10.82]Yeah.
[14:15.80]Why are we playing it seriously now?
[14:19.08]I don't know, because I spent like four hours destroying an entire family.
[14:28.01]Yesterday when we played, I spent the first four and a half hours just actively ruining everything.
[14:35.07]I want to be a superstar.
[14:36.95]And I'm going to get there.
[14:37.57]I want to be a superstar chef.
[14:44.49]Musician?
[14:44.94]No, thanks.
[14:51.66]This house is fucked, though.
[14:53.11]Why is the bathroom in the kitchen?
[14:59.67]It's not.
[15:00.35]It's a different room.
[15:03.47]Animal care.
[15:06.11]I want to take it, but I want to be a chef.
[15:09.64]Why do I care about being a chef so much?
[15:11.34]I don't understand why.
[15:12.16]Do I just take the animal job?
[15:17.94]Why do I care about being a chef?
[15:19.38]It's because... Hold on.
[15:20.46]I'm doing the animal one.
[15:28.61]There's a glass door on the bathroom.
[15:32.81]There it is.
[15:39.07]You should learn magic.
[15:41.71]Medicine?
[15:42.21]I thought there was only... It's because I have three skill points in cooking.
[15:47.37]That's right.
[15:50.20]Business?
[15:51.70]Eh.
[15:54.40]It took you 30 minutes to stand up and sit down again.
[15:56.34]Hmm.
[15:58.56]Politics?
[15:59.44]No thanks.
[16:03.18]In fact, I want to like send like the... I want to send like a thing back to that person.
[16:09.71]It just says... I want to click the unsubscribe on that one.
[16:15.47]I mean, no.
[16:16.71]Oh, okay.
[16:19.43]Hey, does unsubscribe actually unsubscribe or is it just a big lie?
[16:23.53]And they don't actually do it.
[16:24.53]And now they have the info that you've actively clicked on one of their emails.
[16:30.11]You know what I mean?
[16:31.25]That always freaked me out.
[16:39.88]They keep your info, but they take you off the mailing list.
[16:50.26]I need to go out again.
[16:51.18]I need to call somebody over and have somebody hang out with me.
[16:57.08]Info's worth more than you.
[17:00.35]You know, I don't understand that.
[17:04.66]Why is all of our basic info like that so valuable?
[17:09.44]This is how old you are.
[17:11.94]Don't we have a census?
[17:13.49]Like, why don't they just go, like, fucking download the census?
[17:18.71]What are they actually doing?
[17:23.25]Why do they need to know my name is Jeremy Elbertson?
[17:30.01]It's for ads.
[17:34.36]You know, once we started not caring about TV, they were just always going to find a way to fucking get us.
[17:38.30]I always thought that advertisements were just going to go away once nobody cared about TV anymore.
[17:44.28]Oh no.
[17:46.70]Why are you so obsessed with the census?
[17:49.08]When was the last time I said the word census on this stream?
[18:00.05]A year ago?
[18:04.07]When did I say?
[18:04.71]What was the last time I said I referenced the census?
[18:08.85]Stop doing that!
[18:09.73]Hey!
[18:11.09]Stop putting them in weird places.
[18:12.61]Just put them on the ground.
[18:13.59]Hire a maid.
[18:24.62]I don't have enough money to do that.
[18:26.70]I need to go get like a... I'm going to the casino.
[18:32.56]Oh, I remember what I was doing.
[18:34.44]I was going to call somebody on the phone.
[18:37.48]Hang out and watch TV with them.
[18:38.86]I don't want to look for a job.
[18:41.94]Alright, well then call somebody over.
[18:46.21]Where's... There, okay.
[18:47.37]Aren't we friends?
[18:50.21]Everyone's at work.
[18:53.41]Oh, nice.
[18:53.71]Okay, she's coming over.
[18:54.39]Should I put...
[18:58.83]This is not a good look.
[19:00.57]In your pajamas at your computer while cartoons are playing in the background.
[19:03.27]I don't know if this is a great look for someone to come over for the first time.
[19:14.32]It's literally you.
[19:15.76]Yes, it is.
[19:16.64]Yes, except take off the top.
[19:19.25]That's actually me right now.
[19:21.25]Take this off.
[19:26.16]I don't have cartoons blaring in the background.
[19:31.86]I have to get rid of these, too.
[19:33.00]This is creepy.
[19:36.74]Oh, shit.
[19:45.44]Oh, I can't get up right now.
[19:46.72]No, dude.
[19:48.46]I'm like the last 10 in PUBG.
[19:49.66]I can't get up.
[19:53.03]Oh, it's alright.
[19:53.91]I just- I'll be out in a minute.
[19:57.90]Got him.
[19:58.20]Got him.
[19:58.68]Top 8.
[19:58.94]Get the fuck out of here.
[20:03.54]The thing's closing.
[20:04.04]The thing's closing.
[20:09.10]I don't want to fuck this up.
[20:13.05]Is that for me?
[20:13.57]Wow.
[20:21.76]Oh, I can't just like throw it in the trash.
[20:28.74]Shit, I'm sorry.
[20:29.36]Am I gonna throw it down the magician hole?
[20:36.11]Wait, why did I not put it down?
[20:37.41]Imagine handing somebody a gift and they walk around through their backyard with no shoes on.
[20:45.51]Why wouldn't they go in the house?
[20:49.36]I haven't said anything.
[20:51.06]Ah, it's perfect.
[20:51.72]She's cheering me up.
[21:07.48]Oh, thanks.
[21:10.47]Oh, you're so nice.
[21:11.69]Thank you.
[21:24.72]Why is this not fulfilling my social ego?
[21:26.78]Okay.
[21:30.98]Talk about cats.
[21:32.58]Talk about dogs.
[21:33.86]Talk about gossip.
[21:35.18]Talk about interests.
[21:38.56]I need you to fill this bar.
[21:44.16]You like cartoons?
[21:47.12]Wait, come sit down.
[21:50.47]Sit down over here.
[21:52.57]Doesn't like cats.
[21:54.09]Doesn't like cats and doesn't like dogs.
[21:56.33]Oh, man.
[21:58.35]What?
[21:59.21]No!
[21:59.55]What the fuck?
[22:01.84]Why?
[22:02.36]You don't like movies either?
[22:03.30]I don't like you?
[22:03.96]I don't like talking?
[22:04.70]Holy shit, wait a minute.
[22:24.05]gonna play the guitar I'm gonna wow her oh please it's a giant coiled up dump in that toilet I don't flush toilets just make like lunch
[22:50.38]See, it's at this point where she's going to walk out.
[22:53.44]And I'm going to realize I didn't flush the toilet.
[22:55.58]And I'm going to come up with an elaborate way as to why that happened and it wasn't me.
[23:01.04]I would put that on my mother.
[23:02.98]I'd be like, oh, my mother was just here.
[23:04.81]And she just was in a hurry.
[23:06.23]And like, oh, my mother did that?
[23:08.19]What the hell?
[23:09.85]Mom!
[23:10.77]Disgusting!
[23:11.87]Mom, what the fuck?
[23:15.05]And then I would call my mother and be like, Mom, I had to throw you under the bus.
[23:17.11]I'm sorry.
[23:17.35]I'm sorry.
[23:19.90]And she'd be like, no, it's okay.
[23:21.20]Don't worry, honey.
[23:21.92]It's okay.
[23:25.88]Where did she go?
[23:28.80]Omega little traitor.
[23:37.61]Talk, please.
[23:38.85]Come sit on the couch and talk.
[23:44.66]Eat and talk.
[24:05.22]I don't like lifting weights.
[24:06.69]Not anymore, that's true.
[24:09.67]How can somebody be over for this long and I have like E on my gas tank?
[24:15.43]I don't understand.
[24:26.23]Can we just please sit on the couch and just have a conversation?
[24:29.35]I don't care.
[24:35.14]Is that me?
[24:35.72]I think she's gonna go swimming in the pool.
[24:36.90]Alright, I'm going in too.
[24:43.54]Are we gonna talk?
[24:50.11]Delete the ladder.
[24:50.91]No, I'm not deleting the ladder.
[24:52.63]I'm not doing the thing you do in The Sims that's a funny joke.
[24:55.40]I'm gonna be in the, I'm gonna shit in the pool.
[25:02.90]I'm gonna, okay, a huge shit is gonna float up.
[25:07.32]And she's gonna see it, and I'm gonna be like, oh my god, you just missed her.
[25:11.65]My mother did a big cannonball, and it was a big splash.
[25:14.83]And then she shit, she pooped, and I was like, mom, what the heck again?
[25:18.55]You just missed her.
[25:27.92]Why can't I have any fucking friends?
[25:30.90]I got in the pool and she got out.
[25:35.88]She is avoiding me so bad.
[25:37.18]Why?
[25:37.56]Talk.
[25:52.45]This is so weird.
[25:55.05]Why won't they talk?
[25:59.11]Is she just coming over to use my pool?
[26:00.61]Talk!
[26:11.34]This is really weird.
[26:18.88]I hope I shit in this pool.
[26:22.18]Please pee in the pool and have her see it.
[26:31.49]Alright, I'm still in.
[26:32.31]She's getting out.
[26:36.22]She's going for... Where are you going?
[26:40.90]Am I getting out?
[26:42.70]She's about to get on the computer.
[26:44.48]Oh, shit.
[26:45.08]Oh, she's going... She's going to get my Bitcoin hash password!
[26:48.32]Get her!
[26:48.62]Get her!
[26:49.72]Get out!
[27:05.98]Where am I?
[27:06.38]That's just extra water from the pool.
[27:20.57]This is like when you go over your mom's friend's house, because I missed that, but it was probably really funny.
[27:26.22]This person's been over all day.
[27:27.48]Fucking talk!
[27:30.06]I'm just crying!
[27:38.05]Oh my god, this is horrible.
[27:40.91]You don't like science.
[27:42.53]What do you like?
[27:44.58]What does this girl actually like?
[27:46.44]I don't think she likes anything.
[27:49.02]This dog is smelling me.
[27:55.92]You like sunshine?
[27:59.00]I like the sun.
[28:00.46]Oh my god, let me just tell you about the sun.
[28:02.06]I love when it goes behind the clouds.
[28:03.26]I love when it goes out.
[28:04.16]Oh, me too.
[28:04.54]I love when the sun goes behind the clouds.
[28:05.74]I love when it gets a nice overcast day.
[28:07.12]Alright, talk about weather.
[28:08.32]Just keep them locked in this state.
[28:10.44]Okay.
[28:11.18]Just sit here and talk.
[28:32.58]You like ties?
[28:33.92]I love ties.
[28:35.66]You like sunglasses?
[28:37.02]Oh my god, I love sunglasses.
[28:39.16]You like ties again?
[28:41.19]I love ties.
[28:42.15]Oh my god, do you like the sun?
[28:46.47]Yes, I love the sun and the rain.
[28:48.29]Do you like the sun?
[28:52.39]Yes, I love the rain too.
[28:56.14]What a boring conversation.
[29:01.42]We're doing the short, like, how's the weather?
[29:05.14]Kind of like you don't want to talk to somebody.
[29:07.26]You got like 30 seconds on the sidewalk.
[29:09.42]We're doing that for like four hours.
[29:12.75]Imagine bringing up to like the person in small talk on the sidewalk the weather like eight times.
[29:17.89]It'd be like, holy shit.
[29:20.61]Somebody has to end this conversation.
[29:21.87]This is horrible.
[29:22.43]We're probably never going to talk ever again after this.
[29:25.79]Take a shower?
[29:28.67]No.
[29:29.21]Social is more important than that right now.
[29:31.63]Skunk is whatever.
[29:33.17]What happened?
[29:50.48]Wait, I'm not gonna wake, I can't wake her up?
[29:54.86]What the fuck?
[29:56.64]Why can I not wake her up?
[30:08.49]When is she, is she gonna wake up and leave?
[30:10.37]I won't even, I won't even wake her up and be like, hey, there's a couch here.
[30:20.03]He's gonna wake up and... Okay, thanks for coming.
[30:56.03]Why did she pass out?
[30:57.25]Why wouldn't she have left?
[31:01.77]Alright, the well is running dry right now.
[31:03.95]I need to really work on money.
[31:05.27]Okay, I gotta take a career.
[31:14.62]I have to take something.
[31:17.14]I mean, you smell like shit and you pissed yourself and you're in a pool.
[31:19.84]You invited her over.
[31:20.62]You never changed out of your pajamas.
[31:24.15]What the fuck just happened?
[31:29.51]Why is everything in this game?
[31:31.45]I'm too depressed.
[31:37.06]The Sims universe has the shittiest plumbing ever.
[31:40.94]The plumbing is so bad.
[31:41.98]Alright, I need to call the repairman.
[31:44.30]Services.
[31:45.56]Maid.
[31:46.56]Services.
[31:47.70]Repairman.
[31:49.16]Just get them over here and hire them.
[31:57.02]Yes, $10 an hour.
[31:57.96]That's so much.
[31:59.36]In like Sims world for me.
[32:03.68]Because an hour, that's going to be like $150 a day for my account.
[32:05.76]I can't afford this.
[32:15.64]That's $240 a day?
[32:16.76]No, I think the only- Alright, no.
[32:23.18]I'm sorry.
[32:23.54]Can't call if you change your mind.
[32:26.98]You don't need to make 24 hours a day.
[32:35.35]$50 an hour?!
[32:35.79]I don't have any money!
[32:36.93]This is gonna cost a fortune!
[32:41.82]Alright, I need some... You have to.
[32:43.44]I need to do it.
[32:45.01]Then I'm gonna make you leave after fixing the sink.
[32:51.89]Alright, if I slip the repairman like 20 bucks, will he like... Take care of... No, he... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[33:14.84]Did he do it?
[33:15.20]Alright, this thing works.
[33:20.68]Now, here's what we have to do.
[33:21.36]We have to make sure this guy doesn't walk around and, like, eat snacks and, like, read a book and stuff while he's here.
[33:30.39]Come on, come on, come on.
[33:31.99]Alright, 50 bucks.
[33:35.47]He's leaving, right?
[33:36.09]Is he going to the pool?
[33:39.85]Alright, we're good.
[33:43.59]Thank you.
[33:51.61]This is so dumb.
[33:52.93]Okay, quick breakfast.
[33:55.13]My social is already awful again.
[33:57.33]Like, I'm just trying to... I gotta find a job.
[34:03.27]By the way, that's what's causing the problems.
[34:09.69]The piss that's outside is fucking ruining everything.
[34:16.65]Now I gotta...
[34:19.72]I gotta hire the, um, should I just get a butler?
[34:24.02]Okay, I'm gonna get a butler for one day and I'm gonna invite that girl over again.
[34:27.50]And she'll walk in and be like, ooh, he's got a butler.
[34:32.67]Oh.
[34:33.77]And then I'm just gonna, I'll let him go the next day.
[34:37.17]Like, thanks a lot, man.
[34:37.95]Appreciate it.
[34:38.27]Actually, you know what?
[34:38.73]Why would I do that?
[34:39.15]I could just pay one of my buddies like 20 bucks to do that.
[34:42.83]In fact, there are, like, movies, like, 90s comedy movies, where it's, like, the guy's, like, goofy friend is the... Oh, yeah, but just... You look great.
[34:50.69]You look great.
[34:51.07]Just, like, act like you're my butler at the door.
[34:53.05]He's got, like, greasy hair, and I, like, throw it back, and I try to make it look nice.
[34:58.17]You stand in front of the door.
[34:59.39]Alright, thanks, buddy.
[35:00.79]You owe me a six-pack.
[35:01.93]Yeah, I do.
[35:03.50]And then the guy ruins it somehow.
[35:08.20]I mean, that's... I could do that.
[35:10.95]an Adam sandler movie yeah I think that actually happens in three times in three different Adam sandler movies but anyways I need to what was I doing something important alright e and then clean up the random pea puddles the whole point of this venture is you have no friends
[35:42.70]Yeah, but I'll be alright.
[35:44.66]I'm working on it.
[35:47.56]Okay.
[35:48.16]Get the pee out of the yard.
[35:49.68]Look at the room.
[35:50.38]Look at it.
[35:52.50]It's definitely because of all this piss in random places.
[35:54.64]I guarantee it.
[35:55.26]Look at that.
[36:01.06]Did that fix it?
[36:01.60]Alright.
[36:10.05]Stop eating chips and just get out of here.
[36:12.83]Why does it suck still?
[36:14.61]What?
[36:17.17]Why?
[36:17.73]It's zero.
[36:22.29]What is bringing this so far down?
[36:25.73]It's the newspapers?
[36:32.75]Oh my god, all this fucking mail.
[36:34.51]Alright, you know something?
[36:37.63]I'm gonna give you a real big hot take here.
[36:40.27]You ready for a real hot take?
[36:41.57]This is a real one.
[36:44.42]We all talk about how much we care about the environment, right?
[36:48.52]I do.
[36:48.92]I obviously want this planet to stick around for a long time.
[36:51.48]Everybody talks about this, right?
[36:53.38]Yet, we still allow fucking whole magazines that you never ordered, that you don't want, that they somehow just sent to you for no fucking reason.
[37:05.17]Millions of pieces of just paper sent to everybody.
[37:09.44]But we somehow don't want to stop doing that.
[37:13.34]When I go to my mailbox, it's been like this since I was 15.
[37:17.48]Didn't matter where I was, where I lived, what state, what city, didn't matter.
[37:21.08]There was always, like, thick, thick magazines that the household did not order.
[37:27.40]That were just fucking sent to random houses.
[37:30.07]And they were thick, real magazines.
[37:32.97]Big, big, chunky newspapers.
[37:36.31]Like, what the fuck are we doing this for?
[37:38.81]Why do we still do this?
[37:41.77]I think that's a huge problem.
[37:45.51]The whole mail system is so fucked up.
[37:47.23]Like, why do we have... Oh, yeah, we'll just blow out like 28,000 magazines to everybody in the city.
[37:55.46]And they're going to throw them away.
[37:57.20]Not one single person reads those.
[38:01.42]Hand to God.
[38:03.81]I'm sitting here telling you.
[38:06.08]Hand of God.
[38:07.18]I have never opened one of those.
[38:09.08]Ever.
[38:09.54]I just go, that's a fucking lot of waste.
[38:11.68]And then I throw it in the recycling.
[38:15.29]No one opens them.
[38:17.47]No one.
[38:19.36]No one opens them.
[38:21.10]Why do they do this?
[38:22.62]Stop doing this.
[38:23.92]Sometimes I'll even go to my mailbox and it's stuffed full of bullshit that I didn't even order.
[38:28.88]It's like, what the fuck is all this?
[38:30.60]And this one piece of mail that's like a bank statement.
[38:37.24]It's two of the same cat here.
[38:41.61]Oh, shit.
[38:42.01]They're fighting for dominance on who the real one is.
[38:43.89]Oh, shit.
[38:47.55]Boots.
[38:47.85]This is Boots' territory.
[38:51.43]That was rant Andy.
[38:52.47]No, that's fucking stupid.
[38:53.59]I'm sorry.
[38:53.91]That's really dumb.
[38:59.65]We talk all this shit about the environment and how much we care about it.
[39:01.95]But then like with these companies that these same companies will just mass mail the shit out to you.
[39:11.96]Yeah.
[39:20.72]Recycling Andy?
[39:21.78]I don't want all your bullshit!
[39:26.35]I don't want all your stupid mail that I'm not gonna read!
[39:39.58]It's like, if I was walking down the sidewalk, and you stopped me,
[39:44.96]And you said, excuse me, excuse me, would you like to hear about the piano recital that's gonna happen next week?
[39:49.45]I'd be like, uh, no.
[39:53.47]That same person is like, okay, thank you.
[39:56.83]That exact same person stays on that part of the sidewalk and asks you that same question every single fucking three or four days, every week.
[40:04.92]Hey, excuse me, would you like to go to the piano recital?
[40:09.19]I don't want to go to the piano.
[40:10.63]Okay, listen.
[40:11.37]Do I have to say this to your face?
[40:13.81]It's really cool that you have a piano recital.
[40:15.71]I'm not going and I'm never going.
[40:17.88]I will never go.
[40:19.42]Please stop stopping me on the sidewalk and asking me if I want to go to the piano recital.
[40:23.10]I will never go.
[40:24.34]Is this what you need me to do?
[40:25.32]Do you need to hear me say this?
[40:27.96]Okay, alright.
[40:29.56]My God.
[40:31.28]That's fine then.
[40:31.80]You don't have to go.
[40:32.52]My goodness.
[40:33.44]Have a good day, sir.
[40:34.34]Yeah, have a good day.
[40:36.21]A week later, I go to the fucking sidewalk, and this motherfucker is there again.
[40:40.22]Hey, sir, you want to go to the piano recital?
[40:46.66]I'm going to fucking freak out.
[40:48.98]Leave me alone.
[40:52.84]Leave me alone.
[40:54.03]Like, why can't you just leave me alone?
[40:55.33]Oh, by the way, at the end of the piano recital, we're going to give a coupon book to everybody that's there.
[41:03.80]I don't want you fucking coupon books.
[41:05.28]Stop sending me coupon books!
[41:15.27]Oh shit, my Sim is dying.
[41:27.17]No, I'm sorry.
[41:28.31]I'm sick of that shit.
[41:29.65]It's been something that's been on my mind for a long time.
[41:31.77]And I think it's on everybody's mind.
[41:33.27]And wait, don't you step in the food?
[41:34.89]You idiot.
[41:40.35]That's one of those things that you always think about.
[41:42.63]But you never... Oh, yeah.
[41:44.15]I guess that we do have people that do that.
[41:49.09]They need to transition completely into just spam emails.
[41:52.51]And I'll tell you why.
[41:53.75]Because nobody opens those either.
[41:56.66]But at least those aren't clogging up your mailbox and, like, burning down trees.
[42:06.07]If I had to pick one of the two evils, I'd pick that one.
[42:16.21]How about this?
[42:17.29]How about you just don't be a fucking asshole?
[42:19.21]Like, and just send people random shit they don't want.
[42:21.58]Like, when did that become something that... Oh, yeah, well, whatever.
[42:24.30]Just, like, fucking annoy everybody.
[42:28.49]We live in a society of just annoyance.
[42:32.44]Everybody just wants to annoy each other.
[42:36.38]What?
[42:37.64]Why can't we just leave each other the fuck alone?
[42:39.90]Society.
[42:51.15]Yeah, I said it.
[42:53.49]Oh, he's the joker.
[42:58.97]We already went over this.
[42:59.91]No, I'm not.
[43:03.18]Everybody who says they're the Riddler is actually the Joker.
[43:06.10]And everybody that says they're the Joker is actually the Penguin.
[43:09.66]Don't say that about me, because that makes me the Penguin.
[43:24.81]I still need to get a job.
[43:26.96]No, he's not going to want to do that.
[43:28.08]Alright, hunger.
[43:29.04]Let's go for it.
[43:29.62]TL;DR of that conversation is... What the fuck?
[43:36.26]Why is it... No, don't even get into it again.
[43:39.36]Just like, what the fuck?
[43:40.28]Leave me alone.
[43:41.29]Right?
[43:41.79]That's all we need to say.
[43:42.45]TL;DR of society.
[43:54.93]He's got angst.
[43:56.19]Angst Andy.
[43:57.05]That's not even angst.
[43:58.67]Is it angst?
[44:09.52]No, you will come to the piano recital.
[44:11.46]No, I won't.
[44:12.88]No, I won't.
[44:14.46]I ain't going.
[44:14.90]Ever.
[44:15.16]Never.
[44:24.45]You will get the coupon book.
[44:26.32]No, I won't.
[44:36.52]What if you would really enjoy it?
[44:39.98]But, okay, are we going to base, like, our society around, like, your, your, like, kind of friend that doesn't stop asking you to watch a certain movie or TV show?
[44:49.99]You know what I mean?
[44:52.27]Like, is that the excuse you're giving?
[44:59.43]Telling you, you really, you really, you have to watch it.
[45:02.12]It's so good.
[45:02.80]Watch it.
[45:03.12]I don't want to watch it.
[45:04.58]No, you would love it.
[45:05.50]Watch it tomorrow.
[45:06.30]I don't want to.
[45:10.18]Maybe I would.
[45:11.12]I don't want to right now.
[45:12.82]And I don't want to be like forced to.
[45:14.32]And then when you're watching the movie, the friend is like kind of staring at you, like waiting to see what you're going to say about certain scenes.
[45:30.30]It's like, can we watch this in different rooms?
[45:33.06]And, like, every 30 to 40 minutes take a pee break, and I'll tell you what I think.
[45:36.33]And then they give you a coupon book.
[45:54.36]Okay.
[46:01.04]This is never gonna, I'm, I'm gonna, okay.
[46:02.68]No more, no more like, oh, here he goes.
[46:05.64]He's ranting.
[46:06.26]There's no more ranting.
[46:07.60]He's gonna start ranting.
[46:09.98]No more of this.
[46:11.40]I'm gonna play the game now.
[46:16.93]Your sim is dying.
[46:17.77]My sim is in good health.
[46:19.77]He just doesn't have any friends.
[46:22.07]I'm trying to change that.
[46:35.44]Let's just throw it.
[46:36.06]No.
[46:36.26]Alright.
[46:37.94]Call over a neighbor or something.
[46:44.70]I can't get a job unless I have my social high.
[46:51.74]You need so much social because you're so outgoing.
[46:53.60]I don't even care who they are.
[46:58.82]Just bring them over.
[46:59.44]Moe.
[47:07.18]I'm just gonna throw a party.
[47:07.96]Throw a party.
[47:12.42]And I'm gonna have something to do.
[47:14.86]There's a pool outside.
[47:15.84]Let's have like a dance party.
[47:24.90]Group activity.
[47:25.52]Hit this one here.
[47:26.44]This is fine.
[47:27.64]Put it on top of the TV.
[47:28.44]Why not?
[47:29.60]It'll give it like eyes.
[47:30.32]It'll be funny.
[47:35.67]Alright, because I'm having a party, I need to move stuff.
[47:47.16]You drag the couch across the room, and then make it so people can just hang out.
[47:57.09]This thing's dead.
[48:04.95]Alright, so that's good.
[48:05.73]Let's move this so I can have a big dance floor.
[48:12.83]I need a little table.
[48:25.15]Oh, this is good.
[48:25.59]Group activity, right?
[48:26.45]No.
[48:27.97]Just... Okay.
[48:30.29]I don't care.
[48:30.69]Whatever.
[48:31.03]Fuck it.
[48:32.79]This sucks.
[48:34.39]This would be such a bad party.
[48:35.51]It's like you have to drag your TV and your couch out of the way.
[48:37.91]And this is a huge speaker.
[48:39.55]It would sound awful in here.
[48:43.44]Throw a party.
[48:44.10]Here we go.
[48:51.32]If I need to throw a party and have everybody have a dance party here to have my social go up even 1%.
[48:55.46]Sounds great.
[49:05.51]This looks like Jesse's house from Breaking Bad.
[49:07.44]Yeah, it does.
[49:16.26]I turned the cartoons off.
[49:20.12]They're coming.
[49:20.72]Don't worry.
[49:21.23]I promise.
[49:21.71]They're coming over right now.
[49:32.39]Welcome.
[49:34.67]Welcome, everybody.
[49:35.33]Hello.
[49:35.81]Come on in.
[49:39.27]Outside.
[49:41.59]Why can I not turn this on?
[49:43.29]There are no actions available?
[49:45.07]Why?
[50:08.29]There are no- Why?
[50:09.29]What?
[50:19.81]Oh, shit.
[50:34.58]What the fuck?
[50:35.32]Why is it so big?
[50:41.00]I'm gonna run out of money.
[50:41.71]This better be worth it.
[50:56.96]Turn it on!
[50:59.64]Quit before people start leaving!
[51:00.74]Stop crying!
[51:06.63]What?
[51:08.07]Turn this... Turn it on!
[51:35.68]I gotta save this guy.
[51:37.15]I gotta save this guy.
[51:38.05]He keeps doing the sock puppet to this dude.
[51:40.05]They're in an awkward conversation outside the house because I haven't let them in.
[51:43.21]And now this guy is just doing the sock puppet over and over again.
[51:45.63]I'm freaking this guy out.
[51:49.70]This party sucks.
[51:52.80]I feel like this on streams sometimes.
[51:55.04]This is me streaming.
[51:56.14]You know how many times I have had like a technical difficulty happen?
[51:59.30]You guys are all sitting here.
[52:01.53]And like I can't get this thing to work and it's all fucked up.
[52:03.63]And I'm just like, I just want to cry.
[52:05.19]This happens like all the time.
[52:06.27]Here we go.
[52:10.45]Oh, I got the old 1994 PC game to work.
[52:12.93]Everybody at this party saved.
[52:22.33]Let's go.
[52:25.07]Switch to rock.
[52:25.63]Alright, social.
[52:26.69]Somebody talk to me.
[52:53.22]Oh no, it turns out the game was not fun and not funny.
[52:57.47]And all the time I took to get it set up was not worth it.
[52:59.83]Because everybody hates it.
[53:01.57]Are these people still trying to get in?
[53:24.37]What the fuck?!
[53:24.87]Why?
[53:25.03]There's like ten people in my house.
[53:27.11]I'm not- my social is not going well?
[53:29.51]We need to dance.
[53:56.83]Yeah, alright, come on!
[54:06.86]Oh my god!
[54:07.82]This gossip!
[54:09.48]Just somebody talk to me!
[54:10.58]This is ridiculous!
[54:12.33]I won't leave this guy alone.
[54:30.25]Oh no, he's realizing the only reason why I threw this party was to get him to come over!
[54:35.30]Oh shit!
[54:41.42]I fell for the bait!
[54:43.50]Oh no!
[54:47.68]What the fuck?
[54:49.27]How do I make this go up?
[55:00.30]Teenage girl worry?
[55:02.60]I can't... Who's that?
[55:03.83]New friend.
[55:30.27]Meg, Meg.
[55:30.65]It's Meg from Family Guy.
[55:31.83]Oh, that's funny.
[55:32.25]Me and Meg gonna be friends?
[55:33.57]It's working!
[55:56.89]Why are there so many animals?
[55:58.45]This is so ridiculous.
[56:00.85]Why are there so many animals?
[56:04.47]What the fuck?
[56:05.83]Why are there so many?
[56:08.01]Why are there just eight dogs and cats?
[56:12.14]There's just animals fighting in my house.
[56:18.21]This place is fucked up!
[56:19.73]Why would there be this many animals?
[56:25.71]I love it, it's so dumb.
[56:47.57]You have fleas everywhere?
[56:48.72]Oh, you're hungry.
[56:51.02]Well, whatever.
[56:51.88]Leave.
[56:54.26]Go eat on your own time.
[57:14.47]Yeah, it's actually Meg Griffin, isn't it?
[57:26.28]That's interesting.
[57:27.12]I did not expect Meg Griffin to be one of my friends.
[57:35.60]It's really crazy.
[57:40.68]Only Meg stayed.
[57:45.34]This is fanfiction.
[57:46.65]No, it's not.
[57:48.31]It's not.
[57:48.49]Get the fuck out of here.
[57:49.47]Alright, social is fine.
[57:50.55]What?
[58:15.92]What happened?
[58:17.32]What happened?
[58:17.94]What happened?
[58:19.00]What happened?
[58:27.28]Congratulations, you're now friends again.
[58:28.82]What happened?
[58:39.63]Cheer up.
[58:42.05]Alright, it's almost full.
[58:44.97]That's all I care about.
[58:51.02]Friends for 10 seconds.
[58:56.58]You accidentally said, shut up Meg.
[59:00.64]God damn it.
[59:02.55]Alright, we're good.
[59:07.17]Social's back to normal.
[59:08.29]I can actually go get a job.
[59:15.48]Okay cool.
[59:19.72]Family friend.
[59:22.58]She likes criminals?
[59:23.86]Okay.
[59:25.74]Thank you for coming over Meg.
[59:27.54]It's been nice to see you.
[59:29.24]We're going to fucking wave goodbye to you.
[59:43.24]Thank you for coming.
[59:44.98]Goodbye.
[59:45.34]Leave.
[59:45.92]You might be... Yes, you're hungry.
[59:49.65]Goodbye.
[60:09.33]Good to see you again.
[60:10.75]For the first time.
[60:12.71]Bye, Meg.
[60:15.46]Okay.
[60:15.94]Social is perfect.
[60:16.70]Turn this off.
[60:18.90]Oh, I have the huge speaker on.
[60:25.30]You just had so much fun.
[60:26.56]What are you talking about?
[60:27.22]Turn this off.
[60:31.84]Turn off the music and go to bed.

[66:06.60]And then go to bed.
[66:22.11]Social is low again.
[66:23.07]I really should have had outgoing at zero.
[66:27.63]That's the difficulty slider in The Sims 1, is your outgoing meter.
[66:40.30]Was I going to talk to a talent agent?
[66:42.36]I was going to talk to a talent agent, but my character is having problems existing.
[66:48.37]Social drops so quickly.
[66:50.35]And nobody talks to me.
[66:51.31]And I have to throw a party to get someone to talk to me.
[66:53.51]And then it decays in a day.
[66:55.95]Because my outgoing, my difficulty slider is all the way up.
[67:00.62]Alright, here we go.
[67:02.72]Have a quick breakfast.
[67:04.86]And then I'm going to play the guitar for like a whole day.
[67:08.46]I need these creative points.
[67:21.35]You need a job.
[67:45.53]And that off
[67:55.73]I'm going to... Social has nothing to do.
[68:03.19]I just want to... I need to get it up.
[68:06.48]Get social up.
[68:09.82]And then I'm going to tell her to leave.
[68:10.96]Job.
[68:11.20]More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more.
[68:30.80]I'm sorry, but Meg is the only person that has talked to me for more than 10 minutes that hasn't just dropped my social by a thousand percent.
[68:39.44]It's the only person that I get pluses.
[68:42.36]Campaign worker.
[68:43.73]I don't want to do this.
[69:05.09]I want to get this to 100%.
[69:05.65]And then we're going to say goodbye.
[69:14.57]Shit.
[69:17.84]Shit!
[69:22.12]Whatever.
[69:22.36]TV, dude.
[69:34.88]Well, I'm about to have like a really, really like loud shit.
[69:39.60]And go ahead, you know, go turn on the shower too and the sink.
[69:59.03]This is fine.
[69:59.59]Let's let it go.
[70:07.08]Alright, I'm in a really good mood right now.
[70:09.46]I just need to go to the bathroom, have a snack, and get some sleep.
[70:17.34]Very nice.
[70:17.76]I can clean this up.
[70:19.37]And now, check this out.
[70:23.15]I'm gonna play the guitar.
[70:28.21]No, no, don't do that.
[70:29.27]This is why I bought this.
[70:30.57]Play the guitar.
[70:31.17]Wait, first of all, turn all this shit off.
[70:34.30]Are you going for, like, an electricity bill any percent?
[70:36.81]Like, I don't understand what you're doing.
[70:39.77]Turn all this off.
[70:47.86]The bed's in the way.
[70:48.58]Whoa, it's almost there.
[71:04.13]Creativity.
[71:05.17]There it is.
[71:05.51]Where did I get all the charisma?
[71:15.71]Oh, from the mirror.
[71:16.61]Where did I get the body from?
[71:17.77]Nice.
[71:26.85]Okay, I am so skilled.
[71:28.55]That's good.
[71:34.34]Now I can go to the open mic night and actually do something, I think.
[71:36.56]I got a lot of these plants.
[71:38.10]Get a job.
[71:53.86]I'm doing it!
[71:54.74]Get an agent.
[72:00.04]You're statted for it.
[72:01.35]Am I statted for an agent now?
[72:08.67]I think I have to go to Studio Town.
[72:15.61]Alright, let's stop.
[72:16.29]What are you doing?
[72:23.60]Flyer on the ground.
[72:26.00]Oh, this thing.
[72:27.64]Find an agent.
[72:42.24]Meg.
[72:45.60]Check the computer for a chef job.
[72:46.94]Yeah, I'll check for chef.
[72:49.24]If you get a job, you're gonna die.
[72:54.61]I'm not gonna die.
[73:02.84]Let's see.
[73:03.14]Get on the computer.
[73:04.45]Politics.

[73:10.97]No.
[73:11.21]Alright.
[73:12.49]Go be... Agent.
[73:17.72]Just take a job.

[73:57.47]Take a shower.
[73:58.05]We're going to Studio Town.
[74:08.35]Let's get to work.
[74:09.23]Somebody just gave a bunch of subs.
[74:11.79]CabbageheadPhD just gave 30 community subs.
[74:16.47]Thank you, Cabbagehead.
[74:17.15]That's a shitload of subs.
[74:19.01]Congratulations to those of you that got one.
[74:23.76]Thanks for the community subs.
[74:31.39]Okay, let's get that going.
[74:33.27]Good, good, good.
[74:36.25]Send me a cab.
[74:37.71]I'm getting my first acting job.
[74:44.13]Yes, let's go.
[74:49.99]Check that.
[74:54.01]Hmm?
[74:56.21]Oh wait, I can't- that is my job.
[75:06.53]Alright, off to the first day.
[75:08.63]Studio town, let's go.
[75:09.59]Alright, I need to find... Joe, acting opportunities.
[75:20.85]Or, what's this one?
[75:27.15]Launching the careers.
[75:27.97]I'm going here.
[75:29.35]No.
[75:30.61]What launch should I go to?
[75:36.14]This is Family Guy music.
[75:38.89]Yes, it is.
[75:40.47]It actually is Family Guy interlude music.
[75:46.01]Let's go here.
[75:50.89]All that's missing from that is Seth MacFarlane going... The only thing that was missing from that episode.
[76:06.74]Alright, where's the acting opportunity?
[76:11.07]Is this my agent?
[76:13.65]Ask about fans.
[76:28.25]The fucker.
[76:29.48]Fans are what keep the famous going.
[76:31.60]Talk with your admirers.
[76:32.62]Get to know them.
[76:33.82]A lack of attention from you is liable to drive at least one of them to the brink of obsession.
[76:37.72]Isn't that the reverse?
[76:45.21]Of what actually is... Get to know them.
[76:50.91]Talk to them.
[76:52.71]A lack of attention from you is going to drive at least one of them to the brink of obsession.
[77:00.10]But aren't you describing like a parasocial relationship?
[77:15.11]Oh, wait!
[77:15.93]Pose for a picture.
[77:17.55]I'm famous now.
[77:19.66]I have an agent.
[77:21.94]I pay $600 a month to somebody that promises me I'm gonna be famous every week I call or on the phone.
[77:29.45]Get a good photo.
[77:36.17]Congratulations, Jerma Elbertson.
[77:38.10]Due to your recent success in Studio Town, we're upgrading your standing on our star charts.
[77:42.14]You've gained a star level.
[77:47.14]Where's my money?
[77:52.69]Dear Jeremy Elbertson, due to the incredible popularity of the Lugabi photo.
[77:59.03]Right here.
[78:02.39]Act in the emergency scene.
[78:10.23]Pause.
[78:11.35]I gotta read this.
[78:15.08]Most dogs in Studio Town get treated better than this, and your earning power is about as exciting as your lowly star power.
[78:22.38]Channel your bitterness and frustration into your work so someday you'll be on top.
[78:28.97]Friends total star power.
[78:30.33]To land the best gigs, you have to network.
[78:32.73]This number indicates how much star power your friends are worth, and how much you'll need to progress to the next star level.
[78:38.48]Remember, the more famous a star, the more power they wield in Studio Town, and the more helpful they'll be in your career.
[78:45.22]Networking?
[78:45.82]Alright kid, you're too tall for the part.
[78:51.41]You may want to try for a commercial instead.
[78:53.49]I need two and a half stars to do this.
[79:03.35]What is that?
[79:08.87]Where is this person?
[79:14.45]Why are they back here?
[79:15.39]Why don't I get out of here?
[79:33.76]What is this person doing?
[79:42.28]Oh, you trying to be famous too?
[79:47.24]What's a star kiss?
[79:48.42]I'm so out of my element here.

[113:58.48]Hey, do you guys keep your computer on all day?
[114:01.32]I know people that never turn off their PC and that kind of freaks me out.
[114:07.25]I always shut down my computer every night.
[114:17.20]At night, I turn it off.
[114:18.14]Right, yeah.
[114:20.76]Or you put it into sleep mode.
[114:23.36]I always feel like that when you put the computer into sleep mode, or if you don't shut the computer off and turn it back on hours later, the computer sucks.
[114:33.45]It makes it worse.
[114:34.25]It needs to be refreshed and stuff.
[114:37.23]I know that doesn't make any sense, but it kind of does.
[114:39.19]If you have your computer on for like five straight days, I feel like it's slower.
[114:45.72]It needs to go to sleep.
[114:47.50]Just turn off and then turn back on.
[114:51.32]It's actually true.
[114:51.97]It is true.
[114:56.93]It's computing 101.
[115:00.79]It's not a human.
[115:01.85]Yeah, but it still needs to get refreshed, and the RAM needs to be dumped, and the hard drive needs to rest for a minute.
[115:11.28]The video, the graphics card has to not compute for a little bit so they can be fresh when it turns on.
[115:15.74]What was that?
[115:27.85]Alright, I can get up.
[115:28.79]Wake up.
[115:32.11]Turn off this TV.
[115:37.27]Have a breakfast.
[115:38.39]Have a quick breakfast.
[115:42.56]And then play on the computer.
[115:44.16]I got lots of time.
[115:48.38]Let's go.
[115:48.68]Okay, car will be here soon.
[115:59.46]Enough time for me to go to the bathroom.
[116:05.96]Flush that toilet.
[116:11.44]Alright.
[116:12.54]I'm getting a promotion.
[116:15.38]I'm definitely going to get a promotion.
[116:23.53]Why would I even turn that on if I'm not going to use it?
[116:25.03]That's it.
[116:41.17]Why are you taking a shower?
[116:42.13]Alright, come on.
[116:44.73]Why is the comfort going down?
[116:46.27]I need a table.
[116:51.58]He needs to sit at a table.
[116:54.94]And why would you leave this on?
[116:56.12]He turns it on for no reason.
[117:03.44]Hard day of watching TV.
[117:13.46]It's for the maid?
[117:16.53]Promotion.
[117:17.01]Did I even get paid?
[117:20.31]Alright, come here.
[117:25.77]Let's get some social with this cat.
[117:33.19]Come here.
[117:53.33]That's the worst noise.
[117:54.57]Get out of here.
[118:00.21]Social, social, social, social.
[118:08.39]Social.
[118:11.99]Social.

[118:33.78]Wake up dog.
[118:34.38]Pet dog.
[118:35.06]Wake cat.
[118:35.56]Pet cat.
[118:37.99]Nice.
[118:38.29]Okay.
[118:38.57]Awesome.
[118:40.07]Turn this off.
[118:41.19]Yeah.
[118:41.69]Yeah.
[118:42.03]Oh, it's so noisy in here.
[118:46.15]Who the fuck is this?
[118:54.09]Uh... Blair the Bear?
[119:08.60]What the fuck?
[119:09.08]Should I call the police?
[119:14.64]I gotta call the police.
[119:23.67]Why are they Naruto running?
[119:33.73]What just happened?
[119:36.72]Is that just one of my neighbors?
[119:50.49]I'm very confused.
[119:51.53]I just ate something out of my trash.
[120:03.42]Is there any piss on the floor over here?
[120:09.74]Okay, this piss over there.
[120:10.78]Take care of that.
[120:11.80]I have to go to bed.
[120:19.78]Stop going on the couch.
[120:21.59]Go to sleep.
[120:31.99]I have a bachelor's in computer science.
[120:33.65]I know that turning your computer off is good for it, but your addiction to mining Zorn coin is not helpful in any way.
[120:39.58]Please get help.
[120:45.12]Zorn coin.
[120:45.98]That's so stupid.
[120:55.05]Alright, play on the computer.
[120:58.54]We're gonna flush.
[121:01.21]Use.
[121:02.29]Shower.
[121:02.67]Play on computer for the time that I have.
[121:06.87]Hurry up.
[121:07.97]I can play for like 30 minutes.
[121:09.23]Alright, play.
[121:12.37]I'm hungry, but it's okay.
[121:13.25]I should be fine.
[121:13.75]I thought you were gonna answer the phone.
[121:19.07]I'm not gonna pee.
[121:28.05]First break?
[121:28.45]What do you think?
[121:31.25]I need to get promoted.
[121:32.13]Damn it!
[121:41.58]Who's beeping?
[121:42.44]Stop beeping!
[121:45.70]There's so many animals in the road!
[121:47.87]Oh my god!
[121:51.81]This place is a disaster!
[121:53.83]Answer the phone!
[121:57.82]Stop!
[122:07.00]A computer bug is deposited $300 in your bank account.
[122:09.78]Nice!
[122:12.14]Do I have to go in here and then shoo them away?
[122:16.15]Go!
[122:16.55]Get, get, get out!
[122:18.27]I can't listen to this.
[122:20.03]Leave.

[128:14.52]Let the man pee?
[128:16.68]I mean... I'm good.
[128:23.94]Did you flush?
[128:27.04]Yes.
[128:27.28]Because that would be gross if I didn't.
[128:29.90]Alright, can I please...
[128:38.83]Just get promoted!
[128:43.02]Where am I?
[128:43.42]Play on the computer, eat some food, and go for it.
[129:04.50]You have to be happy to get promoted.
[129:06.82]I know.
[129:07.38]I'm trying to get my bars up.
[129:14.53]It needs to be at least three, two, three higher than this.
[129:21.60]Need more skills?
[129:22.62]I do not need more skills to get promoted once.
[129:25.08]No, I don't.
[129:28.73]Alright, where's the dog?

[130:04.20]Are there any stray dogs running around that I can hang out with?
[130:10.58]Oh, god damn it.
[130:12.52]I have to clean that up.
[130:20.95]Okay.

[133:21.43]Okay, that looks fine.
[133:23.21]Right there.
[133:23.71]This is getting rearranged.

[133:38.44]This is the... Oh, no, this... I already have a gray couch.

[133:56.22]Hold on, move this book.
[133:57.34]This has got to move.
[134:00.60]That's in a better place.
[134:01.30]Okay, that's fine.
[134:03.18]That's fine.
[134:05.26]I need a window here.

[134:10.03]Oh, yeah.
[134:10.55]How much is that?
[134:11.09]68 bucks.
[134:12.31]It's a nice, big, beautiful, a big, beautiful window right there.
[134:26.43]Okay, now I need a table.
[134:35.27]This room's not big enough for this.
[134:37.65]Too big.
[134:39.25]That's alright.
[134:39.73]Okay.
[134:59.22]This is a desk?

[135:16.83]What?
[135:18.09]No, it's not.
[135:20.02]How do you mean the window's backwards?
[135:23.26]It's not backwards.
[135:26.24]It is?
[135:26.68]No, it's not.
[135:29.32]These are open.
[135:29.96]How is it backwards?
[135:49.33]Don't those close and open?
[135:51.09]The shutters are in the... Yeah, isn't that... That's how it works, right?
[135:57.72]You know what a window looks like?

[136:23.90]They go out?
[136:26.34]No they don't!
[136:26.96]The shutters go outside.
[136:37.19]I've never had a house with shutters!
[136:40.81]I've never seen that before.
[136:43.82]I thought it was a big bay window.
[136:45.96]I don't even know what that is.
[136:53.02]Shutters?
[136:53.64]I've never had shutters before.

[137:20.32]How do I make this better?
[137:24.59]This kind of needs to go like on the patio or something.
[137:27.75]Is it going to make the room bad?
[137:44.71]Make the house bigger.
[137:48.47]I could.
[137:49.11]How much is that going to cost?
[138:37.33]Just move the computers going over here.

[139:20.16]Shit, I don't even know what color that is.
[139:21.30]It's like a light blue?
[139:33.22]Okay.

[139:51.83]Alright, that's better.
[139:53.27]Much better.
[139:54.91]In fact, let's move that over in the corner.
[140:00.13]And then I can put the plant in here.
[140:02.05]Oh, that's so much nicer.
[140:04.55]This gives more room to move stuff around here.
[140:23.95]Okay.
[140:25.50]Now I need some chairs.
[140:27.36]Look how much better that is.
[140:29.48]I just need some regular chairs.

[141:42.49]It's just a piece of wood.
[141:43.79]It's a place to eat.
[141:44.51]I have to move this too.
[141:52.00]Can I get into bed?

[143:59.98]It's a good setup.
[144:00.66]I like it.
[144:05.00]Go outside and touch the grass.

[146:05.79]Um... Sit.
[146:10.47]Well, she'll be over in a sec.
[146:16.59]Where are you, Meg?

[147:42.54]Getting my social up takes like two full days.
[147:49.33]And how am I supposed to go to work?

[147:56.65]What am I talking about?
[147:58.04]Get in the car.
[148:03.58]I'm not going to work.
[148:04.10]Never mind.
[148:12.26]I'm not going to answer the phone either.
[148:13.70]If I don't answer the phone, then... If I don't answer the phone, then they can't yell at me.
[148:33.22]They'll have to be mad at me through an email.
[148:40.04]Don't worry, I'm going to work tomorrow.
[148:42.44]With full everything.
[148:43.52]I'm going to call Meg over.
[148:45.30]I'm going to eat.
[148:45.80]I'm going to sleep.
[148:46.50]I'm going to go to the bathroom.
[148:48.35]I'm going to be at up here when I go to work next.
[148:50.77]Very cool.
[149:04.24]Okay.
[149:05.12]I've eaten dinner.
[149:07.28]It's 12.30.
[149:07.88]Go for it.
[149:14.12]Let's get ready.
[149:14.58]Is this in here where I'm taking a shower?
[149:18.83]Alright.
[149:20.69]Meg, come on over.
[149:32.28]My favorite soap opera is almost finished.
[149:33.69]I'll be over in a few minutes.
[149:34.55]Perfect.
[149:34.91]It's perfect timing.
[149:35.69]Look what time it is.
[149:38.17]Now, we're gonna sit.
[149:39.71]We're gonna watch TV.
[149:43.87]And talk while we do it.
[149:51.29]Nope.
[149:53.52]Alright, come on in.
[149:59.06]Come watch TV.
[150:03.01]Watch TV.
[150:06.89]I want you to sit and talk.
[150:08.23]Talk!
[150:08.85]97 with Megagryphon.
[150:14.01]I'm not doing that.
[150:35.24]What did I just click on?
[150:38.42]Social, social, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[150:43.90]Social, social, social, fill it up, fill it up, fill it up, fill it up, fill it up.
[150:48.07]Alright.
[150:56.47]You can leave now.
[150:59.58]Let's watch TV, that's fine.
[151:04.68]Alright, she left.
[151:05.94]Now take a look at what time it is.
[151:06.86]I'm ready to go to work.
[151:07.59]Turn that TV off.
[151:11.59]Wait, while I have a second.
[151:14.13]Wait, why is she still here?
[151:15.15]She's in the pool.
[151:21.49]I need a full night's sleep.
[151:24.65]She can just go in the pool.
[151:25.27]I don't even care.
[151:30.89]I got what I wanted.
[151:36.45]Remove ladder.
[151:39.15]She's still here?
[151:39.85]Social's up.
[151:48.82]Energy's up.
[151:49.98]This is a promotion day.
[151:51.58]I just have to get up, eat, shower, and... You motherfucker.
[152:11.32]Get out of here.
[152:21.08]Get out of here.
[152:21.48]Alright, wake up and get to this... Get him.
[152:24.53]Don't let him over there.
[152:26.23]Shoot him.
[152:28.89]Get out.
[152:34.74]Oh.
[152:43.99]Leave.
[152:45.81]You little bastard.
[152:46.71]Clean this up.
[152:56.22]I gotta clean this shit up.
[152:57.12]That's why I have to make sure this is not... Alright, clean.
[153:00.72]Clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean.
[153:02.42]Alright.
[153:06.24]Use.
[153:07.05]Take a shower.
[153:08.19]I got time.
[153:08.57]Okay.
[153:11.81]Quick breakfast.
[153:14.61]Come on.
[153:17.05]Eat.
[153:19.51]Eat it.
[153:20.39]Not yet.
[153:20.71]Don't leave yet.
[153:21.41]Don't leave yet.
[153:21.83]I got time.
[153:24.94]What else can I do?
[153:25.68]Quickly.
[153:27.34]Shit.
[153:27.56]Just go.
[153:27.88]Whatever.
[153:33.86]That's good enough for a promotion.
[153:49.92]What about the bills?
[153:58.99]150 Andy.
[153:59.67]By the way, are there bills just sitting outside somewhere on the ground?
[154:06.29]It'd be red, right?
[154:10.46]I don't think so.
[154:11.14]What about over here?
[154:13.06]No, I'm good.
[154:14.30]I'm going to need to pay them.
[154:20.86]Ask Meg to move in.
[154:22.10]I mean, hold on.
[154:27.52]Where does Meg even live?
[154:39.41]Albertsons.
[154:42.45]Newbie family.
[154:46.57]Griffin family.
[154:54.91]I guess she lives here.
[155:05.98]Hmm.
[155:08.38]Okay.
[155:08.62]It was nice to know where they live.
[155:21.35]Oh, but Peter doesn't like this.
[155:22.67]I don't know, like this mirror for some reason.
[155:23.93]I don't know.
[155:27.70]Who's here?
[155:31.88]Am I gonna show up?
[155:34.96]She didn't invite me over.
[155:36.06]I'm gonna call me over.
[155:43.43]Wait, does this help my social?
[155:44.91]Where's the Griffin phone?
[156:04.38]Garage.
[156:06.04]Oh, the school bus is here for Stewie.
[156:09.22]Oh, Stewie, you got to get to school.
[156:13.02]Stewie not going to go to school?
[156:18.47]Somebody.
[156:18.89]Okay, Meg, get on the phone.
[156:23.79]Stewie, it's time for school.
[156:26.41]I should not have to go to school.
[156:28.09]Vile woman.
[156:30.01]But I guess I will.
[156:32.07]Torment the other students.
[156:37.29]Brian, are you ready to go to school with me and be my chaperone?
[156:41.49]I will take you to school.
[156:44.90]I just did a whole episode.
[156:50.70]Alright, where's the phone?
[157:03.20]Lois.
[157:04.26]Where's the telephone?
[157:06.44]The Griffins?
[157:06.92]There it is.
[157:07.26]Alright, call me.
[157:15.36]Call over.
[157:15.92]I can't believe I'm gonna actually get to go hang out with the Griffins!
[157:21.50]It's nice that you get to relax at home, but poor Jerm is at work.
[157:24.00]Shit!
[157:29.80]When do I get off work?
[157:35.53]Where's Lois?
[157:41.61]Oh my God, Lois.
[157:45.29]Oh, Peter's on a computer.
[157:48.53]Get out of here, Chris.
[157:49.39]I'm on your computer right now.
[157:52.59]Let's play Fortnite.
[157:54.37]It's time to play Fortnite.
[157:57.23]Everybody thought I was going to be in the game, but it just turned out to be a fucking lie.
[158:10.87]I was really hoping that Peter Griffin was gonna come over.
[158:14.22]I was calling Meg over and over again to try to get her to bring the family over.
[158:18.94]You understand?
[158:20.28]What are they doing?
[158:24.92]Why is she naked?
[158:34.60]Okay, I thought they were fighting.
[158:37.92]That's the TV.
[158:39.68]Alright, it's time to call me.
[158:40.50]Get on the phone.
[158:44.20]I want to come hang out here.
[158:55.46]Where is she?
[158:55.84]There she is.
[158:56.60]Call me over.
[159:02.41]I want to come hang out.
[159:08.34]You betcha, by golly gee whiz, I've been hankering to see you.
[159:10.92]Alright.
[159:14.18]Here I come.
[159:14.98]I can't wait.
[159:17.24]I can't wait to finally get to come and hang out at the Griffin house.
[159:22.52]Oh my god.
[159:23.40]Here I am!
[159:40.51]I can't wait, someone's going to let me in the house.
[159:42.01]I'm going to let him in.
[159:51.28]Lois, let me in.
[160:03.75]Oh, Peter.
[160:05.07]Our new friend is here.
[160:06.03]This is a weird self-insert, somebody said.
[160:16.30]I'm writing my own fanfiction of my own universe.
[160:25.50]You know what I didn't know about the Griffin household until looking at what their house looked like?
[160:31.79]They have like a second living room.
[160:34.47]I thought the piano was in this room.
[160:37.49]They have a huge fucking house.
[160:42.49]If you've got two full couches in your house, that's a good indication that you might have a little bit of money.
[160:59.57]You made the house.
[161:01.19]Yeah, I'm saying I didn't know until researching that this is what the Griffins have, like a second living room.
[161:12.51]Do not homewreck the Griffins.
[161:18.15]Alright, let's have Peter do something.
[161:21.39]Here comes the episode, alright?
[161:22.51]Peter's gonna be... Peter's gonna serve dinner.
[161:29.06]We got this new friend, Jerma985.
[161:31.00]He's here hanging out with us.
[161:33.26]I will make my secret Pawtucket Pete beer cheese pretzels.
[161:40.75]Nyeh!
[161:53.53]I'm sorry.
[161:54.53]I had to do it.
[161:55.64]I had to do it.
[161:56.18]It had to be horrible.
[162:00.82]Alright, Peter.
[162:01.32]What do you got?
[162:05.68]Sheriff.
[162:12.77]No fire.
[162:13.77]No fire.
[162:14.43]It didn't work.
[162:18.05]Why is there so much trash?
[162:20.13]There's trash everywhere.
[162:22.68]There's a turkey.
[162:25.30]There's a dirty turkey.
[162:38.95]Am I eating?
[162:39.57]There I am right there.
[162:42.11]Wait, why?
[162:46.68]This is just a reference.
[162:51.67]This is Peter in a suit.
[162:53.87]Hey Lois, remember the time when I pretended to be a raccoon and he died in the trash?
[163:03.67]Why are they all freaking out?
[163:17.45]Actual Family Guy routine, yeah.
[163:27.68]Oh shit, sorry, that was like- I remember when I was a hamster.
[163:30.38]Remember that time when I was a hamster?
[163:34.24]Fuck, I had that, it should have been that.
[163:43.39]Where am I?
[163:43.69]Did I leave?
[163:48.74]Oh, here I am, right here.
[163:49.72]What's gonna happen in the room?
[163:51.80]We're all trying to use the same bathroom.
[163:54.12]Can we, like, give me stuff?
[164:11.34]Now it's self-insert fanfiction.
[164:14.38]Now that's what this is.
[164:15.10]It wasn't that before until right now.
[164:23.32]Mm-hmm.
[164:24.00]Mm-hmm.
[164:24.84]Mm-hmm.
[164:25.65]Mm-hmm.
[164:27.01]Mm-hmm.
[164:48.68]Come on.
[164:59.50]Does this make my social go up too?
[165:00.92]Oh my god, look.
[165:04.76]Me and Lois get along so well.
[165:06.26]Look at how well me and Lois get along.
[165:11.89]so much trash holy shit there is so much trash it's way too much he's like I'm done
[165:42.69]Wait, what?
[165:43.13]What do you mean raspberry?
[165:45.92]Wait, what?
[166:14.75]Fuck.
[166:15.39]Shit, it's not working.
[166:20.73]Abort.
[166:28.72]Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.
[166:31.46]What?
[166:32.56]Oh, I remember that song that our family sings.
[166:34.94]It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV.
[166:41.59]Where are those good old fashioned values?
[166:43.84]On which we used to rely.
[166:44.80]And lucky there's a Family Guy.
[166:47.22]A Family Guy.
[166:49.96]Lucky there's a man.
[166:51.68]Why didn't he put the camera over here?
[166:52.84]Okay.
[167:17.12]They're not married.
[167:18.26]He's sleeping in Stewie's room.
[167:25.17]Where's Stewie gonna sleep?
[167:33.23]Who is in this bed?
[167:34.05]Oh, I think Meg's in the right room.
[167:36.27]Lois is in the right room.
[167:37.67]Peter's in Stewie's bed.
[167:38.73]Stewie's just playing the piano.
[167:43.24]Still.
[167:48.45]Meg is... Where's Chris?
[167:51.69]They all need to go to bed.
[167:53.55]Okay, where's he going?
[167:55.43]He's going... Okay, he's going... This is correct.
[167:58.61]This is Chris's room.
[168:00.73]Where's Stewie going to go?
[168:24.48]I thought that was a gun.
[168:26.36]I was about to scream.
[168:33.83]Why did you get up?
[168:34.75]Nice.
[168:43.76]They're just switching beds?
[168:50.44]I'm so confused.
[168:51.34]What's going on?
[169:03.74]She's going now to sleep in the bed that Stewie is in.
[169:22.63]Oh.
[169:27.35]That was really cute.
[169:42.57]Where can she sleep?
[169:43.41]Oh, they have a couch?
[169:51.09]Holy shit.
[169:51.51]This place is a disaster.
[169:54.18]Alright, that was fun.
[169:55.96]Time for me to leave the Griffin household.
[170:07.19]Alright, goodbye.
[170:15.07]Those of you that want me to check on the Sweets household.
[170:18.25]Sure.
[170:19.90]4-7 lane, the Sweets family.
[170:23.90]Things look like they're going well.
[170:37.22]Now there's another family though, that I'm noticing up here.
[170:46.68]Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Peach.
[170:50.77]It's their house.
[170:56.43]Can you tell that there was quite a bit of time spent on the Griffin household?
[170:59.70]And not very much time on the Mario household.
[171:05.27]You know, all the time last night.
[171:09.72]This is, you know, it's time for bed.
[171:11.74]They're doing great.
[171:24.90]Your debt is quadrupling for this joke.
[171:28.28]That was not a debt that had nothing to do with anything.
[171:32.36]I'm sorry, but that has nothing to do with me.
[171:35.24]You can't just say that.
[171:37.76]How am I doing?
[171:43.42]It's a porn set.
[171:45.69]It is not a porn set.
[171:47.07]It is a mushroom house.
[171:53.23]So I gotta go to work in... Alright, look at my bars.
[171:55.60]They're perfect.
[171:58.20]I'll get promoted tomorrow.
[172:00.20]I'm doing good.
[172:00.78]One more day of at least three or four bars, and I'll get it here.
[172:04.52]It's so early.
[172:09.50]If you marry Lois, we'll remove debt from the... Will you?
[172:15.47]Really, no.
[172:23.54]How much?
[172:23.82]What did you say?
[172:29.33]Two what?
[172:37.27]You gotta have a baby with Lois.
[172:38.93]Oh my god.
[172:41.51]That's so fucked up.
[172:51.77]250 million?
[172:53.85]500 million?
[172:55.91]I'll do it for 500 million.
[172:56.99]I will try to marry Lois for the rest of the stream.
[172:59.67]If you take 500 million off.
[173:05.47]It needs to be a baby.
[173:06.45]I will try.
[173:08.53]You have to take out Peter.
[173:19.64]I don't know.
[173:20.22]I don't think so.
[173:22.50]Mary plus baby.
[173:23.58]Alright, I'll try.
[173:26.16]I'll give it a try.
[173:38.85]750 million if there is a baby.
[173:40.21]Alright, well.
[173:43.49]I think I can do it.
[173:45.99]For now, I need to get a better job.
[173:49.96]Let's use this.
[173:51.68]I'm going to play some computer games and then I'm going to sleep.
[173:59.49]I should put a better chair into here.
[174:00.87]I don't have enough money to do it though.
[174:02.77]Alright, turn this off.
[174:14.50]Really good timing here.
[174:17.30]I'll have... This should get me to four.
[174:19.38]And then I'm guaranteed a promotion if that happens.
[174:24.39]I'll have plenty of time to eat, take a shower, and go to the bathroom.
[174:26.99]Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[174:30.77]Don't oversleep.
[174:35.77]Have quick breakfast.
[174:38.13]Save the game.
[174:38.63]You have to sing Chug Chug while you're woohooing Lois.
[174:48.85]That's so stupid.
[174:59.26]Fine.
[174:59.56]Fine, I will.
[175:03.84]Just for you.
[175:14.81]Eat.
[175:16.41]Oh shit, it's okay.
[175:21.26]Carpool will be here soon.
[175:22.20]Unclog.
[175:24.16]Fuck.
[175:24.66]I need to pee somewhere.
[175:28.92]Oh, god damn it.
[175:34.05]Use it.
[175:39.63]Damn it.
[175:40.61]Fuck.
[175:44.25]Okay, it's cool.
[175:45.37]Whatever.
[175:49.97]Pee in the shower.
[175:54.47]I need social again.
[175:55.89]It's so hard to keep all these bars off.
[176:08.84]She's got it.
[176:11.36]She'll take care of this.
[176:12.38]Did she get rid of the bugs?
[176:17.68]Did she not take care of the bugs?
[176:18.64]Where are those bugs?
[176:22.26]Nice.
[176:22.88]Good work.
[176:27.53]Alright, I'm going to call Lois over.
[176:28.56]Because I need social anyways.
[176:34.26]Uh, Lois Griffin.
[176:48.77]Call.
[176:49.89]Invite over.
[176:52.29]Gross.
[176:55.01]Absolutely, we have so much to catch up on.
[176:57.57]Awesome.
[177:04.09]He is.
[177:04.41]Alright, Lois.
[177:08.35]Shake hands.
[177:08.89]I got 34 right now with Lois.
[177:13.43]By the way, Peter's not here.
[177:35.47]Yep.
[177:35.77]Okay, good.
[177:36.27]Good.
[177:36.57]Okay.
[177:54.52]No, no, no.
[177:54.76]Wait till 50.
[177:55.18]Wait till 50, 50, 50, 50.
[177:56.30]I don't want to do any, like, flirting or anything till 50.
[177:58.70]Here it is.
[177:59.42]Okay.
[177:59.56]Um...
[178:23.84]Hey, it's okay we're friends Encourage
[178:53.07]57.
[178:53.21]I think I'm gonna wait a day.
[178:54.67]This is 60.
[178:55.05]This is really high. 67.
[179:15.32]Get the fuck out of here.
[179:21.46]You're going to ruin everything.
[179:24.83]This is a scheme by Peter.
[179:26.71]This is one of Peter Griffin's schemes.
[179:39.49]I can't do anything about this.
[179:40.57]I can't kill the bear.
[179:42.25]I can't even attack the bear.
[179:45.72]I can't do anything.
[179:48.20]We're at almost 80.
[180:02.19]Time for the puppet.
[180:06.52]Let's see if this kills it.
[180:07.70]Let's see if this ruins everything.
[180:08.66]Here it comes.
[180:30.74]I brought the puppets a little too early, but it's okay.
[180:32.61]You like the puppet.
[180:35.77]Okay.
[180:36.31]I'm almost at 100.
[180:38.79]This is as high as it can be.
[181:02.91]100.
[181:02.97]Okay.
[181:05.15]I'm going to wait a day.
[181:05.83]And then tomorrow.
[181:15.91]She'll come over and we'll hang out.
[181:21.79]My social is all the way up.
[181:23.73]Well, it was really nice to see you.
[181:25.99]It was very nice to see you.
[181:32.73]See you later.
[181:33.15]There it is.
[181:41.71]There it is.
[181:44.83]There it is.
[181:56.12]Tomorrow that's at 100.
[181:57.48]It'll be a little hard there.
[181:58.26]And then we're going to hang out.
[182:11.06]Just drown Peter.
[182:11.98]They don't have a pool.
[182:13.46]And, no.
[182:14.12]Alright, I gotta get to bed.
[182:17.82]I gotta have a good day tomorrow at work.
[182:21.50]Alright, I need to do... We need to go to bed now.
[182:25.84]Bed.
[182:26.08]We have to have a good day at work tomorrow.
[182:36.52]I need that bonus.
[182:42.01]Okay.
[182:43.35]I need some fun.
[182:44.33]I need hygiene.
[182:45.05]Blah.
[182:45.35]Oh, fuck.
[182:45.79]What's more important?
[182:46.91]Eating.
[182:47.11]Okay.
[182:55.84]Now go to the bathroom.
[182:58.64]Just put it down.
[182:59.10]Put it down.
[182:59.48]Don't even wash it.
[183:00.02]Put it down.
[183:03.76]Alright.
[183:04.24]That's not bad.
[183:04.82]That could be worse, but that... Alright.
[183:06.79]That's alright.
[183:07.13]That's alright.
[183:07.51]I'm going to make the money at least.
[183:21.19]You can go to the bathroom at work, but you can't shower at work.
[183:25.92]Not necessarily, right?
[183:35.32]You've been promoted to bit player.
[183:36.90]You're able to support yourself in your own chosen career.
[183:39.53]Barely.
[183:40.83]You've actually got a few lines to speak, ironically.
[183:44.53]They often seem to be, may I take your orders, sir?
[183:47.59]Building relationships and your body is important now.
[183:50.92]You now work from 9 to 3.
[183:52.86]You brought home 200 and got a bonus of 400.
[183:54.66]Let's go.
[184:01.04]Now... I got enough to get promoted again.
[184:05.28]I have enough body, I have enough charisma.
[184:10.29]I can get promoted again if I'm good enough.
[184:18.12]How's my relationship with Lois?
[184:22.10]I think another day has to go by.
[184:23.68]Let's do this right.
[184:31.67]So now the plants are good.
[184:33.01]Everything's taken care of.
[184:34.55]House is in good order.
[184:40.08]I'm going to sit here for a little while.
[184:41.04]I want that fun to go up.
[184:41.84]Are they like pissing anywhere outside?
[184:48.40]Yeah, of course you did.
[184:53.70]Okay.
[184:59.82]Take a shower.
[185:00.38]Go to bed.
[185:03.13]I need a full night's sleep.
[185:08.85]I want that comfort up.
[185:18.39]Put up a no strays sign so they stop pissing.
[185:20.93]Does that work?
[185:30.46]Yes, they can read it.
[185:31.34]What?
[185:39.77]Oh, this is going to be a really, really good day.
[185:42.35]And then sit and play on the computer.
[186:04.26]Alright, put that down.
[186:08.50]Use the bathroom, take a shower.
[186:09.98]Oh my god, everything sucks!
[186:17.88]No, just sit.
[186:25.89]And sit!
[186:31.23]You need to sit!
[186:33.97]Stop playing the fucking guitar!
[186:35.37]Put the guitar down, dude.
[186:45.48]Alright, whatever.
[186:46.02]You didn't sing the Fortnite song?
[186:51.94]I didn't woohoo Lois.
[186:53.34]Okay, that's 200 bucks.
[187:07.40]I'm trying to get him out of the way.
[187:08.50]Get out of the way.
[187:13.21]Recycle, recycle.
[187:17.29]An anonymous gifter just gave 25 community subs from anonymous.
[187:21.59]An anonymous gifter.
[187:22.49]Thank you for the 25.
[187:23.43]You know how we say it here.
[187:25.89]Community subs.
[187:28.47]Everyone like waits for it.
[187:29.33]Like he's going to do that.
[187:29.99]He's going to go community.
[187:35.55]Alright, should I call Lois?
[187:36.61]No, one more day.
[187:37.23]Get this off.
[187:47.35]We're going to sleep?
[187:50.02]Yeah, I'm good.
[187:54.10]Let's get some rest.
[188:00.04]I'll be able to wake up around 2 a.m., 3 a.m.? ?
[188:11.66]Okay.
[188:13.58]I'm going to eat.
[188:19.26]Dermot, eat the poop.
[188:20.38]What poop?
[188:22.40]Okay.
[188:29.25]Computer needs to be repaired.
[188:30.83]I need fun.
[188:32.93]Alright, let's see if I can get this fixed.
[188:39.24]I'm getting very angry at this.
[188:42.65]What's going on?
[188:50.69]What's going on?
[188:51.09]That's scary music.
[188:54.17]What's the bugs?
[188:58.19]Alright, just get up.
[188:58.69]Call the repairman.
[189:09.87]Come fix the computer.
[189:10.57]Please fix my computer.
[189:16.91]They come over at 5 a.m.
[189:32.60]It's taking this guy so long to fix this.
[189:34.22]Oh my god.
[189:37.23]I'm gonna have to pay this guy like $200.
[189:49.92]He's not done?
[189:50.48]Okay, we're good.
[190:05.58]He fixed it.
[190:06.20]Thank you.
[190:09.81]And another 15 community subs from AnonymousGifter.
[190:12.49]I wonder who that could be.
[190:14.64]They were anonymous.
[190:17.54]No promotion, but it's alright.
[190:18.46]Do I have bills I have to pay?
[190:22.14]Or is that good?
[190:24.85]Okay, how's my relationship?
[190:27.23]Alright, we're gonna call Lois.
[190:28.03]I'm gonna sleep, and then today's the day.
[190:44.63]Get this off.
[190:47.88]Sleep for a while.
[190:49.90]I'm skipping work tomorrow.
[190:53.18]By the way.
[190:57.64]What the fuck are you doing here?
[191:00.48]Why is Mario here?
[191:01.39]Like, oh, he's coming.
[191:03.27]What does he want?
[191:11.25]What is he doing here?
[191:25.23]What?
[191:25.43]Can I help you?
[191:27.95]They live really far away.
[191:41.72]Holy shit, Mario has a huge ass?
[191:43.50]Who's Primp?
[191:44.14]What's Primp?
[191:44.52]What are you doing?
[192:10.00]Um, okay, well... Okay, I'm done with Mario.
[192:13.54]At least I can call him now if I want to.
[192:17.16]I'm not going to work today.
[192:19.86]I wish they were red.
[192:38.95]Alright, so let's have, Mario, let's have breakfast together.
[192:45.20]I'm not gonna kill Mario.
[192:46.68]No.
[192:50.14]Want some breakfast, Mario?
[192:52.19]I've got your favorite.
[192:53.11]What does Mario like to eat?
[192:57.97]What do the Mario Brothers eat?
[192:58.95]Spaghetti, right.
[193:02.13]Okay, well, it's not spaghetti.
[193:03.24]It's steak.
[193:04.04]It's steak every day.
[193:12.73]At least we can sit and have a conversation.
[193:15.43]You need to invite Peter over and kill him.
[193:16.99]I don't need to do that yet.
[193:22.37]And I know I just said yet.
[193:23.53]But you know what I mean.
[193:25.45]Jeremy becomes the newest Mario brother.
[193:34.77]And Zonk's lowest griffin.
[193:42.06]That should be all capitals of a YouTube title.
[193:55.42]I gotta pee again.
[193:58.39]After this conversation with Mario, I'm going to pee.
[194:01.51]I'm drinking coffee.
[194:06.93]I feel like the espresso family, like yesterday.
[194:12.92]Yeah, it was good to see you.
[194:15.06]Thanks for coming, Mario.
[194:17.32]It was good to see you again.
[194:19.24]Watch out for the spike trap.
[194:24.39]Alright.
[194:25.49]Now I just gotta go to the bathroom and then I'm ready for... Maybe tomorrow... Wait, wait, wait.
[194:28.75]This seems like a really good bar right now.
[194:33.27]Let's see.
[194:33.71]Let's see if I skip work tomorrow.
[194:40.97]Maybe I'll skip work tomorrow.
[194:48.99]Depends on how good the bars are.
[194:56.60]Is the car coming?
[194:57.30]An hour?
[195:00.66]Did I skip work?
[195:11.12]I'm gonna go to work today.
[195:13.85]This is not bad.
[195:14.73]I might get promoted.
[195:20.15]Average shit.
[195:21.15]Whatever.
[195:21.39]Alright, I'm gonna call Lois.
[195:24.31]I gotta pee, too.
[195:25.19]Alright, hold on.
[195:25.57]Let me actually go to the bathroom.
[195:26.76]I'll be right back.
[198:51.14]I think I'm in the groove right now.
[198:52.40]I think I got it.
[199:01.15]I'm making money.
[199:03.07]I'm not losing money like I was.
[199:04.31]Who peed?
[199:13.65]Thank you.
[199:15.09]I'm so glad that you're doing that.
[199:21.37]Can I just put like a fence this way and this way?
[199:24.20]No.
[199:24.36]Are you pumped to play The Sims?
[199:29.94]Yeah, I mean, I've been playing it for like two days.
[199:32.94]I love this game.
[199:33.50]I mean, it's harder than I remember.
[199:36.45]But it's still fun.
[199:46.29]Got it.
[199:47.48]Yes!
[199:50.17]You've been promoted to stunt double.
[199:53.23]That's not the box office megastar being set on fire and tossed from a helicopter that's you.
[199:59.23]You're making a name for yourself, though.
[200:02.41]And directors like your novel ideas for mock mayhem.
[200:06.01]Keep those creative juices flowing, you just might graduate to a low-budget starring role of your own if you survive.
[200:11.73]Keep yourself and your gear in top shape, or you may miss that airbag.
[200:16.47]Keep developing your active social life, not only is it fun, it's very useful.
[200:21.68]Now make $275, and I got $550.
[200:24.96]Awesome.
[200:25.60]Alright, I need another body.
[200:35.75]I need four friends.
[200:37.95]I have three.
[200:38.57]Okay, I need one more family friend, and I need to work out.
[200:51.70]Where's the workout bench?
[201:04.29]There it is.
[201:09.54]Do it by the pool.
[201:12.44]There we go.
[201:16.00]Turn the mic on.
[201:17.72]My mic is on!
[201:21.05]Alright, how's Lois?
[201:35.17]Call Lois.
[201:37.15]How's my energy?
[201:39.75]It's good?
[201:47.20]Come on over.
[201:51.07]How nice of you.
[201:51.61]Sure, I'll just brush my teeth and be right over.
[201:55.03]Alright.
[201:55.35]Let's make dinner.
[201:58.54]Serve dinner.
[201:59.88]Don't go on the computer.
[202:00.64]Serve dinner.
[202:12.98]Okay, dinner is ready.
[202:14.08]There she is.
[202:18.41]Hello, Lois.
[202:23.46]Oh, I, I'll, yeah, up, up, up, up, up, coming!
[202:29.85]Don't eat without her!
[202:30.79]What the fuck are you doing?
[202:31.69]I saved my whole meal while she's outside?
[202:39.51]What the fuck are you doing?
[202:40.82]I don't, what, why did that happen?
[202:54.01]That doesn't make any sense.
[202:54.97]Why would I sit down and eat my entire meal and I couldn't cancel it?
[203:10.17]You want to come over again?
[203:18.73]Sure, this place is Gullsville.
[203:19.93]I'm going to be at your place.
[203:21.31]Alright, so...
[203:24.02]Clean this up.
[203:36.09]Here we go.
[203:40.65]Good to see you again.
[203:41.81]You're standing in the flower bed.
[203:44.21]That's not really good.
[203:46.01]Okay.
[203:47.61]How are you?
[203:48.15]Pulling the puppet out immediately.
[203:54.34]Where's flirt?
[203:54.96]I think it's not here.
[203:56.40]This dog is growling.
[204:31.14]Stop out doing me in my own house.
[204:44.32]No!
[204:51.21]How do I make this bar go up?
[204:53.51]Oh, yeah, have some dinner.
[205:30.46]Shit, I don't have enough energy.
[205:43.82]Why is flirt not here?
[205:45.28]I'm at 100.
[205:45.52]Should I go?
[205:45.90]Should I try?
[205:46.53]Should I see if she, like...
[205:59.33]I don't flush the toilet.
[206:24.85]I don't think I'm going to be able to sing Victory Royale while I woohoo Lois.
[206:29.65]I don't think I can do that.
[206:31.01]How do I get the bar up below it?
[206:52.86]Your lifetime relationship changes slowly and shows how long-term trends remember.
[206:58.81]So how come this isn't going up?
[207:00.79]I think that's the problem.
[207:01.53]It has to be slowly.
[207:04.23]Alright, alright, fine.
[207:05.23]Goodbye!
[207:25.60]Good to see you.
[207:32.19]You've only hung out twice.
[207:33.21]Ladder Peter.
[207:53.79]I don't even think her and Peter are in a relationship.
[208:06.38]Laterum.
[208:07.34]So do I invite Peter over in Laterum?
[208:09.36]Is that what you're saying?
[208:10.44]That's so stupid.
[208:19.99]I gotta go to work.
[208:26.53]Get the bed.
[208:26.99]You didn't meet him?
[208:37.23]I'll just go to the Griffin house and I'll play as Peter.
[208:54.75]Oh my god.
[208:56.51]Whatever.
[208:56.81]Okay, I'm gonna go play as Peter.
[209:01.63]Is that cheating?
[209:11.20]I need to invite me over the house so I can talk to Peter so I can eventually ladder him in my backyard.
[209:41.35]Whoa!
[209:49.54]It's just like I'm... I get to see what she thinks about me.
[209:52.90]Emily?
[210:02.75]Emily?
[210:04.55]But who are they?
[210:06.01]But are they family?
[210:11.71]What is Lois Griffin's relationship to Peter Griffin in this house?
[210:24.54]Friends.
[210:25.62]Family.
[210:26.12]House.
[210:32.12]No.
[210:33.34]Relationships.
[210:35.73]It doesn't say.
[210:47.38]Sims can't be married in the first game unless you make them married through gameplay.
[210:50.94]Oh, wow.
[210:51.54]Okay.
[210:53.84]Alright, so then I don't have to do anything.
[210:56.73]I don't need to kill Peter.
[210:58.09]They're not even married.
[211:05.69]Oh, God.
[211:06.57]I gotta get her... I gotta get her stuff up.
[211:11.19]That's why I have to keep comforting her.
[211:16.05]You notice that?
[211:16.91]There's always an option for me to cheer her up.
[211:22.31]Okay.
[211:25.23]Peter, get up.
[211:25.83]Get out of bed.
[211:27.37]Who's in the comfortable bed?
[211:29.43]Who's that?
[211:30.15]Chris, get up.
[211:34.94]Go sleep there.
[211:39.30]Lois, go sleep in this bed.
[211:44.90]Make his place in this house.
[211:55.03]What's going on?
[211:55.91]Alright, you go sleep in this bed.
[212:05.46]That's why I have to keep cheering her up.
[212:08.51]What's going on?
[212:08.91]No, go back to bed.
[212:09.47]Why are you getting up?
[212:12.47]Where are you going?
[212:13.37]Oh, eating.
[212:13.83]Okay.
[212:17.27]Okay.
[212:27.76]Make another bed.
[212:28.48]This is a one-to-one recreation of the entire griffin household.
[212:32.20]There isn't another bed.
[212:32.87]I'm not going to add that.
[212:34.87]See, did you just come to turn the TV on in the room?
[212:51.32]Your investments have paid a dividend.
[212:53.54]What?
[212:53.78]Okay, that's good.

[247:01.22]I just flirted.
[247:01.92]And now I can't flirt again.
[247:25.90]It's never worked.
[247:29.04]It's always gone wrong.
[247:31.18]It's never worked.
[247:32.92]Once.
[247:50.35]Why is it even a clickable option?
[247:51.85]It's never- it's- nobody ever wants that!
[247:58.48]What the fuck?
[248:02.06]She fucking combo break- She combo breakered you.
[248:11.62]She's leaving, okay.
[248:25.61]Does he know that he's already friendzoned and cannot have a romance?
[248:28.81]What do you mean?
[248:29.47]What are you talking about?
[248:37.37]She tried to intimately hug me twice.
[248:40.01]And I was like, get off!
[248:41.45]Get away from me!
[248:42.05]Get away from me!
[248:43.59]And then I went to go into, you know what I mean?
[248:45.35]Like, why am I doing that?
[248:46.32]I just tried to initiate.
[248:54.00]You're incompatible.
[248:58.11]They say we're incompatible.
[249:01.10]We'll show them.
[249:01.78]Isn't that like every fucking song you've ever heard?
[249:13.42]It's about like how we're incompatible.
[249:15.06]But we're gonna... It doesn't matter.
[249:18.68]It's like every single fucking love song I've ever heard in my life.
[249:21.04]Like think of some of the most famous love songs you've ever heard.
[249:29.72]For instance.
[249:36.34]That's a famous one.
[249:39.30]Remember that infomercial that came on every day?
[249:48.40]About the love songs.
[249:53.30]I was like, I've looked forward to that part.
[249:55.54]Every time it came on.
[249:59.26]If you know, you know.
[250:00.48]And I don't have to explain that.
[250:08.86]Don't you only listen to video game music?
[250:10.57]I'm calling Peach.
[250:24.35]Do I even have Peach's number?
[250:30.11]Oh shit, it's 3 a.m.
[250:31.29]Do I have her number?
[250:32.67]No.
[250:33.73]I gotta get, like, one of the Mario Brothers to invite me over to their house.
[250:45.66]If you spam the same interaction, it'll lower the success chance each time.
[250:48.08]Do different things.
[250:49.22]But I only have three options.
[250:51.62]Kiss, hug, or talk about interests.
[250:53.96]I can't talk about anything else with her.
[250:57.27]I can only do like the puppet.
[250:59.25]And like cheer up.
[251:08.71]I gotta go to work tomorrow.
[251:09.89]Get him.
[251:10.09]Relax.
[251:10.31]I have to go to work.
[251:14.63]I can't just not go to work.
[251:17.51]I'm gonna call Peach.
[251:21.29]I gotta go meet Peach first of all.
[251:22.77]That's important.
[251:29.84]Go to work.
[251:31.40]Where's the car?
[251:45.17]Oh, no.
[251:45.53]No.
[251:46.13]Why did I get fired?
[251:47.73]Oh, shit.
[251:50.29]Can I get the job back?
[251:56.38]This game sucks!
[251:59.68]Nobody works every single day of the week.
[252:02.92]Monday through Monday with not a day off?
[252:06.37]What the fuck, Sims 1?
[252:08.85]What are you doing?
[252:09.61]There's no days off?
[252:15.87]You work every single fucking day of your life?
[252:19.43]Not one day off.
[252:21.17]Ever.
[252:25.97]I'm throwing a fucking party.
[252:27.77]I just got fired party.
[252:29.09]Bring everybody.
[252:40.46]Who is it?

[252:57.53]Alright, come on.
[252:58.01]What do we got?
[252:59.61]We got Emma.
[253:00.79]We're looking for a Mario.
[253:09.05]What am I doing?
[253:09.69]Go greet your guests.
[253:12.28]These people hate each other.
[253:15.34]They're just ringing the fucking doorbell.
[253:17.20]Alright, I gotta relax.
[253:18.74]My fucking stomach's gonna hurt.
[253:22.72]No, don't...
[253:28.60]Go open the door.
[253:29.70]I need more people here.
[253:35.32]I need to call people.
[253:36.36]I need a friend of a friend to keep bringing friends of a friend until we have Peach here.
[253:41.53]More people.

[254:08.13]No.
[254:08.31]Does anybody know Peach?
[254:09.09]That's Mario.
[254:12.19]It's the same person.
[254:14.94]It's the same person.
[254:17.02]The same person showed up twice.
[254:18.20]There's no food.
[254:25.94]Alright, I'm gonna make dinner.
[254:26.62]I'm gonna make dinner.

[254:33.34]Where is it?
[254:40.58]There's like a full catering table.
[254:42.24]I know it exists.
[254:45.89]What's it under?
[254:46.31]Miscellaneous?
[254:53.41]Miscellaneous?

[262:19.59]That girl that I threw out fucking dropped a- she probably dropped like a dump in the tank, not in the toilet, and she clapped.
[262:28.11]Where am I?
[262:32.95]This lady's stuck in here.
[262:35.81]I need to- I gotta- I gotta detonate this.

[263:02.12]Oh my god.
[263:04.86]Some guy served breakfast for all these fucking animals.

[263:47.96]The person's naked.
[263:49.86]I just... Now pick that up and finish it.
[263:57.14]At least I'll eat it.
[264:01.95]That's Kenny.
[264:03.63]You guys find it fucking irritating that the person that I kicked out first, the person that I scolded is the last one to leave and she still hadn't left and she clogged my toilet and ruined everything.
[264:16.70]She's still here.
[264:23.44]She's not leaving.
[264:37.06]Finally.
[264:40.30]Get out of here.
[264:42.48]What a disaster.
[264:43.22]At least I got Peach's phone number.
[264:47.08]Oh, that was fucking horrible.
[264:55.57]That was disgusting.
[264:57.75]Oh my god, my stomach hurts.

[267:16.06]God damn it.
[267:28.05]It takes a month to clean this all up.
[267:32.70]I know it's not fun to go play on the computer.
[267:34.90]Just don't use the bathroom.
[267:38.28]Alright, I got Peach's number.
[267:42.20]That's all that matters.
[267:49.65]Okay.

[273:57.06]I was telling her to leave me alone.
[273:57.92]I shouldn't have even answered the phone.
[274:15.91]Do it again tomorrow.
[274:21.27]Yes, she really hates juggling.
[274:29.16]That was such a brash reaction to a juggler that I've ever seen.
[274:41.07]And then I'm going to eat and then play on the computer.
[274:45.21]Get it all queued up.
[274:46.07]Let's go.
[274:46.37]Okay.
[274:56.82]And I'll be ready to go.
[275:00.03]You should make Master Chief.
[275:01.17]Okay.
[275:07.28]Take a little nap.
[275:08.22]Take a nap.
[275:11.42]Get that comfort up.
[275:16.79]It could be money.
[275:17.33]It could be money.
[275:17.73]It could be money.
[275:18.15]It could be money.
[275:18.71]You idiot.
[275:19.67]It takes an hour and a half to wait.
[275:21.17]Two hours to wake up.
[275:22.91]Why?
[275:23.11]Alright.
[275:36.76]Oh, neighbor.
[275:46.55]Oh.
[275:53.86]Wanna come over?
[275:55.56]I'd love to.
[275:56.00]Alright, let's go for it.
[275:57.59]I need to at least make her a friend.
[275:58.87]Alert before she's your friend.
[276:07.86]It's necessary.
[276:08.64]Is it?
[276:08.84]Alright, here we go.
[276:14.14]Get off the computer.
[276:22.09]Alright.
[276:22.89]Oh, you've been.
[276:24.12]Oh my god, there's a lot.
[276:26.64]Let's see what happens.
[276:27.50]I don't think she likes it.
[276:28.70]Maybe?
[276:29.10]No, she does.
[276:29.82]Okay, good.
[276:52.24]Okay.
[276:58.21]Like that too?
[277:00.49]Save Caramel!
[277:03.23]Caramel's fine.
[277:05.99]Okay.
[277:06.83]Pretty good.
[277:09.15]So, now... Okay.
[277:23.30]New friend.
[277:23.76]Now, let's just... I'll make some dinner.
[277:37.17]I'll make some lunch.
[277:39.19]You had to go to the bathroom really bad.
[277:40.27]Okay.
[277:40.39]I'm going to make the lunch.
[277:44.46]Have a snack.
[277:45.42]You can go swimming.
[277:46.06]I got a nice pool.
[277:50.44]I'll go swimming too.
[277:55.33]Alright, let's just hang out.
[277:56.19]Look at what he's talking and chilling and hanging out.
[278:04.91]And then we're gonna get up.
[278:06.05]A little sweet talk.
[278:11.35]Lois Griffin's no longer a friend.
[278:12.59]I don't care.
[278:17.12]What the fuck just happened?
[278:22.36]What just happened?
[278:23.18]We were talking.
[278:23.92]I didn't do anything.
[278:33.33]This game, I swear to God, is just throwing dice in the air if a conversation is going to work.
[278:38.04]What?
[278:38.26]We were just sitting there eating dinner.
[278:42.14]Ah.
[278:56.48]Alright, family friend.
[278:58.64]Okay, 73.
[279:10.35]I need that little heart.
[279:14.01]Come on.
[279:14.79]This is the dumbest video game I've ever played.
[279:35.39]What the fuck just happened?
[279:38.09]I just hugged her and then she hugged me and I said, get out of here.
[279:42.10]And then she left.
[279:43.98]How are you ever supposed to get anybody to like you?
[280:00.49]You can't flirt because you're friends, not dating.
[280:04.88]What?
[280:05.14]She's a family friend.
[280:07.64]I was flirting with her and that's what got her to be a family friend.
[280:16.41]You can't be friends.
[280:23.03]What?
[280:23.31]What?
[280:30.53]You friendly hugged her.
[280:46.36]Be mean to her, lose her as a friend, and then flirt with her.
[280:54.73]Try Lois this time.
[280:56.85]What are we doing?
[280:57.87]Oh.
[281:02.35]It's an old game, Jerma.
[281:03.21]They didn't know how healthy relationships worked.
[281:07.07]Just be friends?
[281:08.37]I'm not even friends with her anymore.
[281:10.79]What happened?
[281:16.47]You have to spend a trivially amount of time building this relationship.
[281:19.07]Alright, fine.
[281:23.25]Let's go downtown and hang out.
[281:24.35]Did I just call a taxi and...
[281:34.82]Let's go hang out at the... Here.
[281:45.85]Just use the cheat code.
[281:47.25]No, I can't cheat.
[281:50.64]Okay.
[281:52.24]We are now friends.
[281:53.36]So I'm just going to leave it as is.
[281:54.54]We're just going to talk and we're going to go on like a little date.
[281:57.50]Okay.
[282:00.92]Already friend zone.
[282:01.76]I didn't even do anything.
[282:02.64]They shook hands at the date and I became friends.
[282:07.85]I'm just going to drown Peter in this pond.
[282:26.16]Come with me.
[282:26.52]Come just sit on the bench with me.
[282:36.31]Playing the fountain?
[282:43.20]Where'd she go?
[282:43.88]Alright, come sit over here.
[282:53.88]Juggle, lose her as a friend, and then flirt, flirt, flirt, flirt.
[282:59.53]No, that's not how it works.
[283:00.63]Lois had a smiley face and a heart.
[283:07.77]Miss Crumplebottom.
[283:17.14]This is nice.
[283:19.44]This is nice.
[283:40.87]It worked!
[283:41.23]Now we clap.
[283:41.65]Not yet!
[283:41.85]Mama?
[284:10.25]I don't want Mama to come over and compliment me.
[284:12.50]Mrs. Crumplebottom keeps coming over here.
[284:13.82]Don't stop.
[284:38.79]This game is stupid
[285:07.90]Now, watch.
[285:08.44]She's going to come try to, like, kiss me.
[285:10.62]And I'm going to go... And I'm going to push her away.
[285:12.96]Watch.
[285:13.16]I'm not going to do anything.
[285:47.13]That's so weird.
[285:50.53]That's weird.
[285:51.23]Don't do that.
[285:51.95]Why would you be like...
[286:15.26]Sleep right here.
[286:17.06]This is fucking weird.
[286:18.10]What are we doing?
[286:18.84]No, I'm not gonna try again.
[286:46.78]No, it's not.
[286:47.30]I have to wait till... I have to wait.
[287:14.44]If this was Sims 2, you would have 10 girlfriends already.
[287:17.00]Is that how it works?
[287:18.67]Is this the worst date ever?
[287:20.69]I thought she was going to pee her pants.
[287:46.03]She doesn't know where the bathroom is.
[287:47.71]Is there even a bathroom here?
[287:48.75]You want to go to the boat thing?
[288:03.24]Beach, come over here.
[288:03.94]Let's get a radio-controlled boat.
[288:17.69]It's like too far away.
[288:18.53]Mario and Princess.
[288:45.98]Alright, I'm gonna leave.
[288:46.84]We're gonna go home.
[288:47.87]It'll be alright.
[288:49.53]That was fun.
[288:51.59]Rent a picnic basket for a hundred bucks?
[288:54.87]No, no thanks.
[288:59.01]Hey, Peter.
[289:13.96]Are you in here with me?
[289:15.18]How are you?
[289:16.06]How's things, Peter?
[289:18.00]Doing good?
[289:19.24]That's good.
[289:21.04]Where's Peach?
[289:21.88]Peach?
[289:44.23]Um, how are you?
[289:45.31]Let's go, let's go.
[289:45.95]No, no, I'm back to my date.
[289:47.08]Uh-oh.
[289:49.20]Uh-oh.
[289:49.64]What?
[289:49.84]Be hugged by Lois.
[289:53.82]Where is Lois?
[290:17.18]How does she have binoculars?
[290:19.66]Why?
[290:20.52]What the fuck?
[290:20.92]He hugged.
[290:24.20]And then all of a sudden now I'm deciding I want that to happen now.
[290:48.53]I don't know what to do anymore.
[290:49.82]I don't know what is supposed to work.
[290:51.84]It's not doing it.
[290:58.22]This is not going well.
[291:16.70]I don't know.
[291:20.24]What am I supposed to do?
[291:23.43]What should I do?
[291:25.45]He's like, please help me.
[291:27.07]I don't know what I'm doing.
[291:27.85]You think I know what I'm doing either?
[291:29.03]What?
[291:47.93]So if I initiate it, if I say, hey, I would love to give you a nice big hug, I'll go for the hug.
[291:55.98]If they come to give me a big hug, I'm like, get away from me.
[292:00.18]Within the same five-second period.
[292:02.20]Within the same two-second period.
[292:06.98]It's because you smell?
[292:09.10]Oh, God, can I shower in the bathroom?
[292:12.61]I'll be right back.
[292:13.31]I'll be right back.
[292:18.22]Get in the bathroom and just wash your hands.
[292:20.20]Get in the fucking bathroom!
[292:26.27]Dude, what are you doing?
[292:27.35]Go wash your hands!
[292:40.39]Shit, goddammit!
[292:43.81]They're pissed!
[292:47.05]Lois is off the meter, by the way.
[292:48.71]She's gone.
[292:49.27]Look at how bad that was.
[292:50.75]She found me with fucking binoculars.
[292:55.42]Tried to give me a hug.
[292:56.86]I told her to fuck off.
[292:58.38]I then tried to hug her and it works.
[293:12.25]Let's get out of here.
[293:19.99]Somebody said, man, you suck at this game.
[293:36.55]I came here with 70 and then I left here with 50.
[293:46.50]No, this game's hard.
[293:48.84]You just watched that happen.
[293:53.15]I got like followed here by Lois.
[293:55.21]She just found me here and started trying to talk to me and hug me.
[293:58.23]I denied her.
[293:59.71]I then tried to have a casual conversation with her.
[294:01.39]I tried to hug her within five seconds.
[294:03.65]The whole thing freaks, everything freaks out.
[294:06.51]Peach then fucking hates me.
[294:08.35]I go, I smell, I go wash my hands in the bathroom.
[294:11.38]And at that moment, it's when they all leave.
[294:17.22]I'm never gonna have, I'm never gonna get like a spouse.
[294:27.10]I have to go home now.
[294:39.93]Is it time to, is it time to date Peter?
[294:41.97]I don't know, I feel like the same thing's gonna happen.
[294:48.88]Okay, get... What a mess.
[295:19.18]And I don't even have a job.
[295:22.28]How are you supposed to keep up relationships and go to work every single day in The Sims 1?
[295:28.33]How did they think that was going to work?
[295:48.22]Alright, eat something.
[295:48.90]And then go play in the computer.
[295:56.18]And then do I even dare try to call anybody and have anybody come over and hang out with me?
[296:01.56]Okay, I was going to say.
[296:12.12]Lois has 25 down here.
[296:17.76]Should I call Lois again?
[296:21.98]Lois is the highest.
[296:26.18]Peach?
[296:30.69]Bank account is getting dangerously low.
[296:34.25]Go gamble.
[296:36.21]I will.
[296:37.03]I think I'm going to have to.
[296:41.91]I took a shower last night.
[296:43.17]How is it at zero?
[297:01.24]that fucking thing out of here.
[297:02.10]I think it's annoying.
[297:04.37]Okay.
[297:17.92]What time is it?
[297:19.36]It's 8pm.
[297:22.28]Who do I have some... Okay.
[297:24.20]So I'm gonna call Lois.
[297:31.30]I gotta get social.
[297:32.50]This is fine.
[297:32.98]Alright, this is gonna be fine.
[297:35.79]Comfort's good.
[297:36.37]Let's wake up.
[297:38.89]And I'm gonna call Lois.
[297:39.81]I just wanted to hear Jerma sing and see Otto.
[297:49.35]I mean, I wanna sing the Victory Royale song too.
[297:53.63]Should I call Peach?
[297:55.07]Or should I try?
[297:59.71]Lois.
[298:03.97]She did come find me yesterday.
[298:08.55]We have to catch up.
[298:09.21]Okay.
[298:11.41]This time, I am going to do what you guys said.
[298:13.58]I'm not going to try to... I'm not going to make friends.
[298:23.30]How's Caramel?
[298:26.48]We'll check... I'll check on Caramel later.
[298:36.49]Alright, where's Lois?
[298:40.16]Where's Lois?
[298:40.54]Alright, let's have... I'll serve dinner.
[298:42.20]Peter is in love with you.
[298:48.80]Date him.
[298:50.20]Air kiss.
[298:51.98]I'm just... Let's just... Okay.
[298:55.38]Flight.
[298:56.98]No, don't do that.
[299:12.69]I got dinner on the table.
[299:14.33]I'm in a pretty good mood except for like all the dog pee.
[299:17.13]That's by the way in the corners of the map this pets expansion that they did was terrible.
[299:26.28]Like why do I have to take care of this?
[299:30.84]The room is so bad because there's pee in the corners of the lot.
[299:34.66]They're not my dogs.
[299:35.82]They're not my animals.
[299:45.78]Alright, let's go and sit down.
[299:46.68]Stop watering your plants, you fucking weirdo.
[299:49.84]Get in there.
[299:50.22]Okay, so... How are you?
[300:05.55]I can't do anything besides friendly.
[300:06.81]There's no flirt.
[300:20.71]It's The Sims.
[300:21.23]How are you losing?
[300:22.87]The difference between The Sims 4 and The Sims 1 is The Sims 4 is Viva Pinata and The Sims 1 is Dark Souls with a blindfold on.
[300:32.27]That's the difference in difficulty.
[300:34.00]Is she fucking leaving?
[300:50.01]Oh my god.
[300:50.73]You just ate and left.
[300:54.19]Fuck.
[301:00.77]Come on.
[301:15.66]I'm not even hungry.
[301:16.60]I'm just eating it because it's made and I have to eat it.
[301:30.69]The house is clean.
[301:31.97]Alright.
[301:32.85]Tomorrow.
[301:33.97]We're going for it tomorrow.
[301:37.03]Take a shower.
[301:38.80]Get some rest.
[301:40.36]We're going to hang out all day tomorrow.
[301:42.12]We're going to do something fun.
[301:46.54]We're going to wake up at a normal time.
[301:54.56]Okay.
[301:55.06]No, you don't need to eat right now.
[301:57.38]Go play video games.
[301:59.34]Like, three or four hours.
[302:00.02]Okay.
[302:08.24]What game's more... What's more realistic?
[302:10.32]This or Facade?
[302:13.46]Um... I mean, that... Probably this.
[302:16.53]Alright, now let's... I'm gonna take another nap.
[302:22.35]No, don't make that.
[302:22.81]I wanna take a nap.
[302:24.88]Why can't I sleep?
[302:28.88]Okay.

[303:31.67]Where's my... Neat, outgoing, active, playful, nice?
[303:58.56]What's wrong?
[303:59.94]So what?
[304:01.25]Is this a Libra?
[304:02.27]Hold on.
[304:03.43]Most compatible with Virgo and Cancer.
[304:07.23]What are you?
[304:09.13]Virgo and Cancer.
[304:11.19]This is Cancer!
[304:16.13]They're all Cancer.
[304:18.99]So what the hell?
[304:28.94]I didn't even, I didn't do anything.
[304:35.21]They're my old friends.
[304:35.77]Okay.
[304:38.19]I'm not going to do anything.
[304:39.71]Let's just continue.
[304:40.71]They'll just talk and hang out.
[304:42.07]No, I'm not.
[304:46.86]You don't kiss.
[304:47.46]I'm not going to kiss now.
[304:56.49]No!
[304:56.75]I need to flirt first!
[304:59.53]How did I get the heart last time with Lois?
[305:04.65]I don't even remember.
[305:21.70]I kissed her.
[305:22.34]I don't think that's what happened.
[305:24.83]It was Peck, was it?
[305:25.69]It was Peck.
[305:26.27]It was an on-the-cheek kiss is how it happened.
[305:28.07]Kiss is an upgraded flirt.
[305:49.44]75 and friend.
[305:50.40]It's a tier one kiss.
[305:52.76]You kissed the cheek.
[305:55.30]Is that what this is?
[305:56.40]This is an upgraded flirt?
[305:58.12]That doesn't...
[306:20.04]Start with the maid.
[306:21.04]No, I can't.
[306:22.02]Let's just go in the pool.
[306:25.30]I'm at 68, though.
[306:26.54]I was at like 100.
[306:40.83]Game is broken?
[306:42.01]No, it's not.
[306:44.11]You need more long-term points.
[306:48.41]How many days have to go by for this to go up?
[306:54.87]I feel like this has been over 40 or 50 for like a week.
[306:58.10]Two weeks.
[306:58.52]It takes multiple months for this to go up?
[307:17.63]You need the daily relationship to be over 7.
[307:19.73]70.
[307:21.37]Okay.
[307:28.71]Top bar is daily, and lifetime bar... So if the top bar has to be over 70, the bottom bar has to be over what?
[307:38.08]Real lifetime is the bottom bar.
[307:40.18]In-game time is the top bar.
[307:47.56]70 is to get a crush.
[307:52.38]Really?
[307:56.72]Actually, I need to make money somehow.
[308:02.89]Have one of them move in.
[308:04.05]I don't think I can do that.
[308:07.07]70 on the bottom bar is love.
[308:14.67]Oh, okay.
[308:16.89]What you're saying is I should just sleep and like pass time for like three weeks.
[308:28.76]And just make sure all the lights are off.
[308:32.52]Okay.
[308:34.20]I'm just going to get a job and just do nothing but just go to work for like a month in the game.
[308:39.96]And I'm just going to let the gameplay itself.
[308:42.84]And every week I'm going to call her over to hang out and just hang out.
[308:54.49]Okay, that sounds good to me.

[321:18.02]Take a bath.
[321:27.10]She just- Alright, Peach just come- I figured it out.
[321:28.98]Peach just comes over and swims in my pool and then leaves.
[321:30.68]She's visiting the house and she doesn't want to talk to you.
[321:42.66]She's coming over to swim.
[321:47.12]And eating.
[321:48.10]Like, I'm feeding her and she's swimming in my pool.

[324:21.72]The animals give social.
[324:23.00]Yeah, you're right.
[324:23.54]I keep forgetting that.
[324:27.54]Tomorrow I paint.
[324:28.16]Why is she not getting out of the pool?
[325:04.36]I'm dreaming of her.
[325:05.36]Okay, go ahead and get up.
[325:32.77]Goodbye.
[325:34.99]It's been fun.
[325:46.94]Who's calling me at 10 o'clock at night?
[325:52.53]The number 6 will be very important for you in the next 24 hours.
[325:55.21]What's that supposed to mean?
[326:01.32]What the hell are you talking about?
[326:03.52]Alright, go back to bed.

[329:34.08]Is it done?
[329:36.32]Shit, it's almost done.
[329:40.44]I should adopt a dog?
[329:41.08]It's probably going to cost too much money.
[329:42.18]Can I chat on the computer?
[329:44.96]No, unfortunately not.
[329:58.69]Why is your character insane?
[330:00.35]This is every sim.
[330:02.57]All Sims are...
[330:12.34]Zero social.
[330:13.28]Alright, call Peach over.
[330:15.04]Come over.
[330:19.46]Yes, alright.
[330:20.42]What are we at?

[330:36.61]She brought food.
[330:37.25]Hmm.
[330:42.29]Oh shit, this is bad.
[330:44.43]I'm going to have to start selling furniture.
[330:59.75]I almost have a painting done.
[331:00.57]Are we eating chocolates off the ground?
[331:04.70]Alright, let's talk.
[331:07.08]Hang out and have a conversation.
[331:09.91]37.
[331:09.93]100.
[331:09.99]I can't go higher than this.
[331:11.89]And now... I have to eat some food.
[331:12.85]I'm not going to buy it.
[331:14.09]Is she leaving?
[331:14.55]Is she leaving?
[331:41.10]I didn't like that.
[331:43.52]Sell the gift for money.
[331:48.59]My social is still this bad?
[331:50.41]I just talked to her for like four hours.
[331:52.19]I really do need to get like a dog or something.
[332:03.87]Stove.
[332:17.85]Where's an animal?
[332:19.13]I hear a cat.
[332:20.87]Just come over here.
[332:26.32]Just play with animals for like the day.
[332:50.98]It's actually better, yeah.
[332:54.88]This feels like... This feels dumb.
[333:01.35]I just have to pet- I just have to talk to all the- and hang out with all the pets here.
[333:05.33]And I'll fill the bar in not even an hour.
[333:08.94]Talking to an actual person does not raise my bar.
[333:24.29]Guarantee you she's in the pool right now, swimming.
[333:26.31]Guarantee it.
[333:30.17]Got her.
[333:32.57]I should have bet.
[333:33.43]I should have bet money on that.
[333:35.37]I should have bet money on that.
[333:36.45]It was a mistake.
[333:50.27]Social itch.
[333:51.03]What does that say?
[333:53.71]Alright, I can fill the social bar by hanging out with animals.
[333:56.46]Oh god, she's annoyed.
[333:57.44]Is she bored?
[333:58.32]She's coming to hug me.
[334:00.18]Okay.
[334:00.34]Alright, I was hanging out with animals instead of you.
[334:12.26]Hug, hug, hug, hug.
[334:16.66]Be hugged.
[334:24.58]Who's going to bed?
[334:41.35]Inviting somebody over just to play with cats in the road.
[334:47.06]There's poop on the ground.
[334:48.02]That's why.
[334:48.82]It's this hidden poop everywhere, isn't there?
[334:53.89]Is that the problem?
[334:57.79]Is there just hidden shit all over the place?
[334:59.55]Okay, I need to go to bed now.
[335:11.60]I gotta sell this painting and pay these bills.
[335:26.19]Hurry up and eat.
[335:31.40]Go to bed.
[335:33.74]Finish the painting tomorrow when you get up.
[335:35.96]Well, first play League of Legends for like six hours and then finish the painting.
[335:45.39]I'm determined to sell these paintings for a lot of money.
[335:54.86]I have to fire somebody.
[336:06.64]Here we go.
[336:07.50]I'm gonna go hard with painting.

[336:46.39]No, I just did this one.
[336:48.37]Come on.
[336:48.71]I have another point in creativity.
[336:51.73]Yes.
[336:52.99]Finish it.
[336:54.65]Sell it.
[336:56.56]71.
[336:56.66]Alright.
[336:57.38]How many?
[336:58.14]I am almost at full creativity.
[336:59.60]Almost 100%.
[336:59.80]Alright.
[337:02.12]Now I can pay these bills.
[337:17.93]Is more in there?
[337:18.81]Okay.
[337:21.63]I'm not going to pay these yet.
[337:24.06]I'm going to paint again tomorrow.
[337:29.42]Trust me, this is going to be the meta.
[337:31.00]Watch this shit.
[337:33.10]I found what I want to do.
[337:33.86]Go to bed.
[337:42.85]I'm going to get to all points in creativity.
[337:45.77]And I'll be able to sell these paintings for like thousands.
[337:55.51]Okay.
[337:59.36]Let's eat.

[339:00.66]Come on, give me another point in creativity.
[339:04.18]Yes!
[339:06.92]I am one point away from having 100% creativity.
[339:19.95]That is now as much as a job would pay.
[339:25.07]I just have to do it every day.
[339:27.78]Don't pay those bills yet.
[339:29.62]Alright.

[340:33.78]Here's the plan.
[340:35.20]I'm going to do three paintings at max creativity.
[340:40.02]If I make less than $200 on one of those three paintings, if I don't make at least $200 from those paintings, I'm going to uninstall The Sims 1.
[340:47.83]Okay?
[340:51.65]If I don't make $200 from one of the paintings, I'm uninstalling the game.
[340:59.86]I'm going to do three paintings over full creative bar.
[341:14.47]Otherwise, what the hell?
[341:18.43]I can't make more than 160.
[341:19.29]Oh.
[341:28.08]Never mind.

[341:43.38]Okay, I'm realizing what I'm doing.
[341:45.12]Alright, everyone's freaking out.

[341:53.58]And then using it.
[341:54.90]Because I'm trying to... Okay.
[341:57.71]But why won't I just flush the damn toilet?
[341:59.75]That's so stupid.
[342:02.77]Whatever, okay.

[362:37.31]She wants to kiss you.
[362:38.01]She wants to hug you.
[362:38.59]She wants to kiss you.

[362:43.46]Oh my god.
[362:45.00]What the fuck?
[362:49.02]Oh, it's so stupid!
[363:00.69]Like, I was just stuck in front of the television.
[363:03.26]I want to just throw this TV.
[363:04.36]I want to just punt this TV a hundred yards.
[363:12.26]What?
[363:12.50]Am I changing plates?
[363:17.97]What is this character doing?
[363:35.60]I can't believe the TV me- Okay, there's that.
[363:40.56]How you doing?
[363:40.88]Good?
[363:56.12]Who burped?
[363:57.04]I don't know who burped.
[363:58.70]This sucks.

[364:06.25]It was done.
[364:07.73]It was done.
[364:08.13]It was over.
[364:08.69]I had it.
[364:09.19]It was over.
[364:09.79]I had it done.
[364:10.73]I did.
[364:11.49]You know what I did.
[364:12.35]This is not fair.
[364:18.21]She was standing in front of you so you couldn't get up.
[364:20.21]Just desperately trying to hug and kiss me.
[364:26.06]34.
[364:26.80]God damn it.
[364:30.54]That's so frustrating.
[364:55.79]I don't want all this junk.
[364:57.29]Stop sending me mail.
[365:03.23]I'm gonna call her again.
[365:05.25]Okay.
[365:12.90]Here we go.
[365:14.72]Where's the phone?
[365:18.64]Is it her?
[365:26.31]Who is it?
[365:28.49]The game design that you submitted was purchased outright by the publisher.
[365:31.21]You received $950.
[365:31.73]Whoever facilitated that deal should go to jail.
[365:43.32]I think you need to add a couple of zeros there before that's actually what you should have done.
[365:49.49]At least.
[365:51.73]Okay.
[365:52.57]Um...
[365:56.68]Use the bathroom.
[366:00.32]Of course.
[366:00.62]Did the sink break?
[366:03.02]I just had it fixed.
[366:03.68]What am I doing?
[366:15.95]I can fix it myself.
[366:16.75]I don't need to repair, man.
[366:20.42]Take a shower.
[366:21.94]Take a nap.
[366:22.86]And then call her over.
[366:33.09]Call neighbor.
[366:36.19]I'm just freaking this out.
[366:37.93]I'll be over in a few minutes.
[366:38.75]Alright, let's try this again.
[366:39.69]Turn the TV off.
[366:44.23]Serve dinner.
[366:50.68]I'm going to do a polite kiss.
[366:51.94]Come on.
[366:53.54]This is it.
[366:54.14]Polite kiss.
[366:57.34]Here it comes.
[367:00.81]It's done.
[367:03.17]It's been done.
[367:04.91]There it is.
[367:06.86]That is a kiss.
[367:14.36]Finally.
[367:16.84]Now let's eat and hang out and then... Where's the heart?
[367:20.56]How come there's no heart?
[367:24.43]Well, we didn't know.
[367:28.37]Where's the heart?
[367:31.93]Now, this is not a victory royale.
[367:33.93]There's no heart next to her name.
[367:38.93]A light kiss does not equate to romance?
[367:52.94]Alright, this is it.
[367:55.12]Not yet.
[367:56.38]Not yet, not yet, not yet.
[367:59.65]I'm gonna fucking play Fortnite for like five minutes.
[368:00.99]Okay.
[368:12.92]Passionate kiss.
[368:13.58]Let's go.
[368:13.88]No!
[368:24.95]No!
[368:27.29]I can't even.
[368:28.83]This sucks.
[368:30.51]No.
[368:31.57]What?
[368:35.15]No.
[368:35.81]All the progress is gone.
[368:37.33]All the progress.

[382:05.48]It doesn't matter.
[382:06.10]The game's like impossible.
[382:07.20]Just cheat.
[382:09.42]I can't do that right now unless I have to.
[382:11.00]I'm going to get up, play with some animals.

[383:35.84]Okay, come on in.
[383:44.38]Fucking, it's in the way.

[384:04.67]Okay.
[384:14.37]Why am I... The whole room.
[384:25.20]Okay, clean this.
[384:29.24]Alright.

[384:51.51]And?
[384:51.67]And?
[384:52.31]And?
[384:57.64]I was about to click it!
[384:59.16]I was about to click it myself!
[385:01.54]I was about to click that button myself!
[385:04.04]I was gonna click it!
[385:07.18]I don't understand this video game.
[385:12.42]I was hovering over the fucking thing.
[385:14.98]I waited too long.
[385:49.54]If I had done that, she would have denied me.
[385:52.00]But if she doesn't, I deny her.
[385:53.38]It's like, what the fuck is going on?
[385:55.54]Okay.
[386:16.41]I have to paint today.
[386:20.08]Go paint.
[386:29.77]Just go edit her.
[386:30.51]Look at the goddamn bills.
[386:39.57]Okay.
[386:41.55]How did it- It went down too.
[386:46.35]Jerma, Sims are going extinct.
[386:48.38]You have to breed.
[386:50.79]That's great.
[386:52.69]I don't think it's possible.
[386:56.00]I think it's impossible to have a relationship in The Sims 1.
[387:00.64]Unless you make them in the same household and make them married already.
[387:05.22]Like, by the first part of the game.
[387:06.58]Can you even do that?
[387:07.18]Can you even make people even married in the first game?
[387:09.05]Hmm.
[387:21.45]I can't believe she went for a, she went, played the music.
[387:24.80]It was like, I was like, get away from me.
[387:31.69]I was about to click the button.
[387:32.67]That was so stupid.
[387:45.90]What the fuck is calling me right now?
[387:47.40]Inheritance.
[387:47.80]Better be great-great-grandmother.
[387:48.88]Come on.
[387:50.32]Money.
[387:51.16]There it is.
[388:04.91]Okay.
[388:08.69]Go sleep for a little bit.
[388:09.94]It's two o'clock.
[388:10.72]I'm going to invite her over.
[388:18.09]Flush.
[388:19.79]Use.
[388:20.01]Flush.
[388:21.45]I can't believe I have to do that.
[388:23.21]And then I'm going to serve dinner.
[388:24.63]And I'm going to call her.
[388:25.89]Here we go.
[388:31.33]Here she comes.
[388:47.28]Get that fucking TV off.
[388:56.59]Pick it up, you idiot!
[389:10.15]I still can't believe that animals can pee in the corner of your lot.
[389:20.43]I'm like molding, I'm mold clicking right now.
[389:33.43]Just put it down, just put it down.
[389:40.56]Oh, yum.
[389:50.19]Hey.
[389:50.41]Just relax.
[389:51.73]Save, scum.
[389:52.31]I'm begging.
[389:52.75]I don't think that's going to work.
[389:53.99]Okay.
[390:19.24]You want something to eat?
[390:20.16]Let's have some food.
[390:24.99]Grab a plate.
[390:26.23]Have some.
[390:29.53]It's good.
[390:42.36]I'm jumping the gun.
[390:47.51]This is it?
[391:24.48]Oh, come on.
[391:27.40]What's that?
[391:27.90]Hey!
[391:56.70]This game is stupid.
[391:58.20]This game is stupid.
[392:02.38]She literally tried to passionately romantically kiss me 24 hours ago.
[392:07.40]And then if I initiate it, it's not going to happen.
[392:12.99]This is stupid.
[392:14.13]Oh, stop.
[392:22.57]Burped.
[392:23.23]Burped.
[392:27.03]This game is impossible.
[392:31.42]I actually think The Sims 1 might be impossible.
[392:44.23]Back on the computer.
[392:53.04]Every thread I read about this game is like, holy shit, it's impossible.
[392:58.22]This game's not possible.
[393:00.04]It's impossible.
[393:06.81]This is an uncompletable video game.
[393:12.73]Do we just throw dice in the air for every encounter? ...
[393:21.92]This is a poopoo fucking diarrhea poopoo game.
[393:24.62]I'm sorry, that was fucking stupid.
[394:05.03]I'm not gonna really go play the guitar.
[394:41.43]I can't even do this anymore.
[394:43.32]This is stupid.
[394:56.05]You have to have at least 80 in the relation- No, that's not even real.
[394:59.25]That's not even accurate.
[395:10.75]I thought that was the one.
[395:11.63]When she went to kiss me, I thought that was it.
[395:14.92]It's not.
[395:15.88]It's not.
[395:16.40]I have no idea.
[395:17.18]I... I'm gonna fucking melt down here in a minute.
[395:29.49]When your character's too short, they have to be at least six... Alright, ban that person for like 45 minutes at least.
[395:35.09]I want that person banned for at least 10 minutes.
[395:41.08]Okay, I guess we're gonna- I'm just gonna go to- I'm just gonna fucking go to- Mmm, no more swearing.
[395:58.70]Jeremy, you were having fun playing.
[395:59.98]Just calm down.
[396:02.18]Well, I hit the relationship- And by the way, here's another thing about this game.
[396:06.32]I'm expected to have, like, five of these?
[396:09.79]Seven of these?
[396:12.60]I can't even keep one person interested.
[396:15.90]Let alone ten.
[396:16.90]Are you kidding me?
[396:21.54]And go to work every day with no breaks?
[396:24.08]You have to make sure they're both in a good mood.
[396:33.18]I can't see the mood bar for Peach.
[396:42.90]You had more fun killing the whole family.
[396:46.41]I'm gonna piss the bed.
[396:47.37]Oh, shit.
[397:10.80]I'm not even friends with her anymore.
[397:12.40]What the fuck?
[397:16.72]I'm gonna give it one more real attempt before I take off the nostalgia glasses and never play this shitty game ever again.
[397:24.81]You know what I mean?
[397:28.45]I'm giving it one more solid attempt.
[397:41.17]That was for Lois?
[397:44.15]Oh, but no, that doesn't matter.
[397:46.49]All you care about is the Fortnite song anyways.
[397:54.16]Does that matter?
[397:54.90]No, it doesn't matter.
[398:08.41]tar down what are you doing stop I'm gonna sell it alright I gotta I gotta I gotta get centered here I am furious I'm furious at this game's mechanics I hate them I need to ground myself and just chill I'm gonna go for it again if it doesn't work then what okay it's all good
[398:38.64]Okay.
[398:40.16]So.
[398:42.80]What do we do first?
[398:44.76]First things first.
[398:46.40]Get in that shower.
[398:48.09]Jeremy, take a shower.
[398:48.89]Okay.
[399:00.96]Go pee.
[399:04.60]Go take a nap.
[399:06.71]I'm going to get up tomorrow morning and have breakfast.
[399:08.95]I'm going to pet some cats who continue to pee in the corners of the map.
[399:13.75]What a great idea that was.
[399:15.63]Stop!
[399:16.01]I'm getting, like, fucking mad again.
[399:18.17]Slow down.
[399:18.67]Okay, wake up.
[399:29.53]Just take care of it.
[399:35.38]It's in the four corners of the entire map.
[399:37.42]This is going to take three hours.
[399:44.41]Okay.
[399:45.71]Now I'm dirty.
[399:48.75]Just put a litter box near the house.
[399:50.93]What a genius that person is.
[399:53.77]What an absolute genius.
[399:55.89]Are you kidding me?
[399:58.09]What a perfect thing to do.
[400:00.71]I need a litter box.
[400:02.39]That's so dumb that that's what I have to do.
[400:13.58]I don't want to take care of all these animals.
[400:23.53]Okay.
[400:26.37]It's 2 a.m.
[400:26.91]Let's go.
[400:35.13]Wasn't there a sign?
[400:35.83]I feel like the people were just messing with you.
[400:37.24]Are you guys fucking with me?
[400:45.67]I kind of need those animals though right now.
[400:58.74]I've heard there's a mod for Sims 1 called Sims 2.
[401:00.78]Apparently it makes the game much more fair and fun to play.
[401:02.82]They even added 3D graphics.
[401:04.08]Isn't that amazing?

[403:21.32]It was added in Hot Date.
[403:26.96]Why do they make it even... Why do they make it harder to do that?
[403:29.17]Wouldn't they want to make it easier?
[403:30.17]If it's called Hot Date...

[404:33.83]I just called her.
[404:36.19]Stop.
[404:36.39]Alright, let's make dinner.

[416:13.96]She tries to kiss me.
[416:15.06]I try to kiss her.
[416:15.84]It doesn't work.
[416:17.33]We can only intimately hug each other and, like, rub each other's backs.
[416:34.22]Huh.
[416:37.21]I would say that this is going too fast, but she's trying to kiss me too, like romantic passionate kisses, and I am denying her.
[417:06.92]Come on!
[417:08.66]How many times do I have to do this?
[417:09.92]Romantic hug.
[417:11.93]No!

[419:47.34]Okay, it's fine.
[419:48.14]It's saved.

[457:26.41]That's it.
[457:28.52]Princess Peach.
[457:30.06]Wife.
[457:32.24]Done.
[457:37.65]It cost $1,000?
[457:38.19]Wait, we're getting married here and not...
[457:48.10]Oh, and our dog!
[457:48.98]And our dog, Fifi!
[457:51.33]I did it.
[458:02.59]I got it.
[458:08.52]Hooray, I win.
[458:19.28]Here she comes.
[458:19.74]Okay.
[458:23.29]She's just getting in.
[458:23.91]I didn't even do anything.
[458:37.07]Is that me making dog noises?
[458:38.66]I was like crying.
[458:41.80]Why was I crying?
[458:50.12]What are we doing?
[458:50.98]Okay.
[459:00.78]How do I have a kid?
[459:01.42]How do you have children in The Sims 1?
[459:09.31]Go adopt Caramel.
[459:15.25]I don't think I can.
[459:21.53]She's now Peach Elbertson.
[459:37.95]Doffed Caramel.
[459:38.71]I don't think I can do that.
[459:43.67]I gotta get out of here.
[459:44.45]It's been almost eight hours.
[459:45.29]I gotta move.
[459:49.30]How do I do this?
[459:51.99]How do I go rescue Caramel?
[459:57.84]Keep having boing boing.
[459:59.08]It's RNG.
[460:06.30]Can I make her leave the house?
[460:08.34]Is it like move sim?
[460:10.81]Buy a phone.
[460:11.53]I can't buy a phone unless this is out.
[460:17.47]Fire will never go out.
[460:23.01]Is it out?
[460:23.43]She's about to sweep up all the ashes.
[460:29.54]We're gonna get to see the actual end of the arc here.
[460:31.30]I need a phone.
[460:46.25]Okay, she has a phone.
[461:05.34]Who can I call?
[461:06.02]Didn't this happen in Home Alone?
[461:13.62]You order a bunch of pizzas and they don't know there's a kid here.
[461:16.57]Am I going to put a bunch of mannequins up and pretend there's people in the house?
[461:20.63]Like puppetry?
[461:28.78]Oh god, I need to eat food.
[461:29.60]Hurry up.
[461:32.18]Call a pizza.
[461:32.74]Yeah, call a pizza.
[461:33.64]She called the pizza.
[461:35.14]Get a pizza.
[461:45.60]Get the pizza!
[461:46.82]Get out of the shower!
[461:49.90]Oh my god, get out of here!
[461:52.36]You fucking psycho!
[461:54.06]Get out of here!
[461:55.30]What are you doing in here?
[461:56.28]Why are you in here?
[462:00.07]Get out!
[462:03.75]No, don't put it on the ground Caramel!
[462:06.79]Oh god!
[462:10.39]She's just eating on the toilet.
[462:12.47]At least it's food.
[462:13.46]Oh, fuck.
[462:15.04]She's alright.
[462:15.58]She's alright.
[462:15.98]Okay, grab a slice.
[462:17.36]Watch TV.
[462:19.30]I'm not going to school.
[462:20.26]My house just burned down.
[462:33.16]Why am I washing the pizza in the sink?
[462:38.12]Why am I eating the sink?
[462:40.94]I can't do this.
[462:41.66]I need to eat more.
[462:44.44]She's eating the whole pizza.
[462:52.19]She ate an entire large pizza.
[462:58.05]Mario!
[462:59.59]Please, Super Mario, help us!
[463:03.75]Mario, help us!
[463:09.32]What?
[463:11.02]Mario, please!
[463:18.63]Wait, is Mario taking a...
[463:51.38]What happens to the house?
[464:03.34]Wait, is that because I didn't go to school?
[464:12.14]I saved it right before that.
[464:20.92]So if I go back to the neighborhood and don't save the game, and I just reload the house, I don't have to quit the game, right?
[464:39.78]Alright, we gotta get to school.
[464:40.56]We have to get to school the next day.
[464:45.74]Did she start laughing?
[464:49.66]We have to order a pizza.
[464:50.52]We have to get to school.
[464:51.28]Okay, get a pizza.
[465:11.35]Okay, I need to go to the bathroom.
[465:16.41]Get the pizza.
[465:16.85]Fucking weird, like weird guy again.
[465:22.03]Thank you.
[465:22.37]What time does the school get here?
[465:32.21]An hour.
[465:32.51]Alright, boss is going to be here any second.
[465:45.35]Oh god.
[465:47.81]What the hell?
[465:49.33]Okay.
[466:04.45]I got pizza here.
[466:05.51]I got two dollars.
[466:06.49]That's enough for me to eat pizza.
[466:08.77]I can sell all this junk.
[466:27.50]I'm going to be fine.
[466:28.06]Okay.
[466:38.27]There she is.
[466:38.81]She's back.
[466:39.75]Okay.
[466:40.01]Take a shower.
[466:45.17]Does she have to pay the bills?
[466:53.21]I'm going to school.
[466:56.92]Get the phone, get the phone, get the phone, get the phone, get the phone, get the phone!
[467:02.31]Who is it?
[467:02.65]Evict Karamo from the neighborhood map and then have her move into your house.
[467:12.81]They're coming.
[467:13.65]Think twice about opening the door.
[467:15.23]Holy shit, that's the most terrifying thing I've ever heard.
[467:28.78]She needs to go to bed.
[467:29.50]She's having nightmares.
[467:44.95]Save her.
[467:45.43]I will.
[467:45.71]I will.
[467:45.95]I will.
[467:46.19]I will.
[467:46.45]I need to get her to... I need to get her, like, okay first.
[467:59.35]What was that?
[467:59.71]What was that?
[468:11.41]What was that?
[468:14.69]I was like going times three sleep speed.
[468:24.39]It was a ghost?
[468:30.54]Alright, put on cartoons.
[468:31.34]Do another Kevin McAllister order of caterers?
[468:42.49]Alright, I'm going to order catering.
[468:43.87]$350.
[468:43.93]I need a punch bowl or a catering table.
[469:05.09]Catering table.
[469:15.14]Where is it in the plus karaoke stage?
[469:27.46]I don't see catering table.
[469:35.03]Canning center, honey maker.
[469:37.91]It's a buffet table.
[469:46.50]Where is it?
[469:53.42]Literally off living off of the ashes.
[469:56.42]You're allowed to cheat.
[469:57.28]Okay.
[470:06.89]Move her out.
[470:08.10]I got a plan.
[470:08.74]Don't worry.
[470:09.54]I have a plan.
[470:14.24]I wish like... This wasn't like a picture book.
[470:20.49]Where is this thing?
[470:26.08]In kitchen?
[470:43.22]Why do they make this shit so hard to find?
[470:49.90]Just give me alphabetical order.
[470:52.17]This is stupid.
[471:02.52]How do I change this?
[471:08.00]Lighting.
[471:09.28]Appliances.
[471:10.65]How do I change it to be like the actual not stupid way to have this?
[471:17.73]I know there's a button I can press.
[471:18.69]What is it?
[471:18.97]How do I do it?
[471:28.55]Appliances plus.
[471:31.37]Oh my god.
[471:37.34]This game's fucking dog shit.
[471:40.00]Just kidding.
[471:40.78]I'm kidding.
[471:41.12]I'm kidding.
[471:41.78]Relax.
[471:42.34]I'm kidding.
[471:42.74]Alright, make sure I have a buffet table.
[471:55.57]And then should I...
[472:08.39]Alright, I got money.
[472:10.05]Let's go.
[472:12.39]There you go.
[472:19.58]Alright, let's get these bugs.
[472:25.94]Where's my caterer?
[472:32.64]Okay, now... Now I have to throw a party.
[472:42.81]Why is he putting this on the table?
[472:47.13]Why is he taking this?
[472:56.54]Who can I call?
[472:57.28]Oh no, eat, eat, eat food first.
[473:10.14]Ooh, it's delicious.
[473:12.81]I'm just eating cake.
[473:23.38]Shit, a school bus is coming.
[473:29.06]Stop eating food!
[473:43.08]Does he just stay here?
[473:43.84]What's he doing?
[473:47.98]Why is he still here?
[473:50.29]Okay.
[474:16.47]Can I hire like a service to come?
[474:20.79]Hey!
[474:30.13]What happened?
[474:30.71]It's because her grades are bad.
[474:34.11]We're just going to get her.
[474:49.43]This lot is currently zoned as a residential lot.
[474:51.43]Please choose what type of lot you want it to be.
[474:52.99]So, I'm evicting her?
[474:54.49]No, wrong?
[475:01.93]You want to evict them?
[475:04.42]Yes.
[475:11.02]You want to bulldoze the house?
[475:13.10]Yes.
[475:22.61]guys um no one lives here but cats is this why the entire time I've been playing the game they've all been coming to my house this person is not here the cat family
[475:47.70]I think whoever owned this house is dead.
[475:50.06]Was that the lady that burnt 14 hours ago in game?
[475:59.19]That had to have been the person that died.
[476:03.63]Looks like they're doing okay.
[476:04.79]And that's why they keep coming to my house.
[476:07.75]Okay.
[476:09.13]Select or create a family.
[476:10.77]Where is she?
[476:14.79]Move in family.
[476:17.40]Come on.
[476:18.90]Come on.
[476:19.28]I can't.
[476:24.05]I have to evict them too.
[476:27.23]I don't think I can do this.
[476:31.35]Create new family?
[476:36.44]I messed it up?
[476:37.60]Well, she's safe.
[476:40.14]Let her move in with the cats.
[476:53.66]Well, I'm kind of curious about this.
[477:00.76]Slow down, what the fuck?
[477:13.01]What?
[477:20.67]Why do I have control of the cat?
[477:24.87]What do they eat?
[477:35.90]There used to be a lady here.
[477:45.66]These are the cats that kept showing up.
[477:48.20]Remember Boots?
[477:49.74]Boots would show up every day.
[477:50.80]She burned to death.
[478:02.29]Okay, that's it.
[478:03.57]I'll see you later.
[478:04.85]I'll see you next week.
[478:06.03]You'll find her urn.
[478:07.67]I think I sold it.
[478:08.39]I threw it away.
[478:13.91]That's probably the longest stream I've done in a while.
[478:18.49]I feel okay.
[478:19.35]I do.
[478:20.69]I was able to get up a couple of times.
[478:24.15]I've been doing some new treatments.
[478:28.65]So that's where I kind of have been.
[478:32.05]Each time you don't see me for like six days in a row.
[478:36.37]Let's see how it goes.
[478:37.27]I'm going to keep going.
[478:37.93]The schedule is good for me.
[478:39.96]I'll see you guys on Saturday next week.
[478:43.82]This has been The Sims 1.
[478:44.80]Probably not going to play it again.
[478:45.74]If I'm going to play it, I'm going to play The Sims 2.
[478:48.06]A much far better game.
[478:49.68]Far better experience from what I've been told.
[478:53.26]All jokes aside, this is a classic video game.
[478:55.76]It's very, very fun, although it's painfully difficult.
[479:01.17]Let's do The Sims 2 at some point in the future.
[479:03.47]Yeah, that was a long one.
[479:07.25]I was just having fun.
[479:08.73]That's the point, right?
[479:12.90]Just save it just in case.
[479:15.68]And that's that.
[479:18.47]I'll see you guys on Saturday of the coming week.
[479:20.73]Have a great rest of your weekend, although it is almost over for a lot of you.
[479:24.85]Have a good week.
[479:28.73]Let's get the credits on here.
[479:33.21]Oops.
[479:36.76]Is it frozen?
[479:37.22]No.
[479:41.74]My chest and stomach hurts.
[479:45.05]From just laughing at all that stuff and just freaking out.
[479:48.01]Is this a Meltdown stream?
[479:48.89]I don't know.
[479:49.23]Does that qualify as a Meltdown?
[479:51.47]It may have.
[479:51.89]Some of it may have.
[479:53.29]I think a little bit was.
[479:54.03]Hey, we got what we wanted.
[479:59.18]Got to see the thing we wanted to see.
[480:02.16]I'm happy about it.
[480:05.28]I missed, uh, Eladil gave 10 community subs during some of that nonsense.
[480:09.46]Nonsense.
[480:11.45]Rolla Crunch gave five.
[480:13.36]Vessel Winfield gave five.
[480:15.18]Thanks a lot for those community subs.
[480:23.40]Every eight-hour stream is a meltdown stream.
[480:30.33]You know, that's probably somewhat correct.
[480:34.71]You're probably right.
[480:37.93]We did not have sex with Lois.
[480:40.95]Well, it was a different cartoon character, okay?
[480:49.62]It doesn't have to be with Lois.
[480:51.02]It doesn't have to be with Lois.
[481:01.81]Raid?
[481:02.47]Uh, yeah, let's do a raid.
[481:03.43]Let's do...
[481:08.22]Who's live and who's playing things right now?
[481:09.70]We raided Joel a week or two ago.
[481:14.01]Let's go to... What is he doing?
[481:30.43]Dodge the question?
[481:31.11]What was it?
[481:31.37]What question?
[481:35.61]Hold on.
[481:36.13]Let me put this over here.
[481:43.93]I'll dump you guys on Etalyx.
[481:45.93]He's playing Disco Elysium though, so... He's probably... And this is, by the way, this is like I think the end of the game.
[481:56.66]Like Etalyx is at the end of Disco Elysium.
[481:59.18]So if you don't want to get spoiled, then I would just be aware of that.
[482:06.32]You may see like the end of Disco Elysium.
[482:10.89]Go say hello?
[482:11.39]Hello?
[482:13.39]Keep that in mind that he's playing Disco Elysium.
[482:17.10]Go say hello.
[482:24.70]Don't be weary of spoilers.
[482:31.58]Good night.
[482:32.24]I'll see you guys next week.
[482:33.40]Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[482:35.38]And a great week.
[482:37.86]Good night.
[482:38.30]Take care.
[482:38.66]I'll see you guys soon.
[482:41.09]Goodbye.
[482:57.27]Thank you.
[483:32.15]Thank you.
