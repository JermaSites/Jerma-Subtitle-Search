[ve:61.1.100]

[00:00.93]I've actually never played this game, but it's always really fun to watch.
[00:05.13]Oh, okay.
[00:08.03]Sorry, I didn't finish the sentence.
[00:09.50]He's having a breakdown.
[00:10.48]Why?
[00:10.66]Well, have you ever played Telephone?
[00:17.27]The game where you whisper in someone's ear?
[00:19.75]It's like that, but with drawing included.
[00:21.61]Have you played Drawphone?
[00:23.43]I think it's literally this, but simpler.
[00:25.36]Oh, yeah.
[00:26.10]That's probably it.
[00:28.82]I didn't know Drawphone existed.
[00:31.71]I am Harsha.
[00:33.65]Oh, wait, who's that?
[00:34.49]We're just the link.
[00:36.37]It's an on-site.
[00:37.37]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[00:38.34]I think I'm in there.
[00:39.06]I'm in there.
[00:39.88]Oh, you're in there?
[00:42.24]Maybe.
[00:42.44]Wait, where?
[00:42.84]We are $1,700 away from the permanent tattoos for Bren, which, you know, I got to say, don't do it to him.
[00:49.53]This is actually a double whammy.
[00:50.60]This is for Bren and Giel now.
[00:52.48]Oh.
[00:53.12]Oh, we're all getting them?
[00:55.22]Those two are getting them.
[00:56.26]I can't believe you're getting one, too.
[00:58.05]That's crazy.
[00:59.11]That's three people getting tattoos, and it's only $1,700 away from that incentive.
[01:04.19]That's crazy.
[01:05.70]Lamtix, thank you as well for the Prime sub.
[01:07.32]Again, all of the subscriptions to the Twitch channel are going towards One Step Camp as well.
[01:12.14]Yeah, you can have up to 14.
[01:13.22]So if you have any Prime subs to give, give them.
[01:16.59]They don't even have to be on screen.
[01:17.73]It's basically Amazon donating to charity, and I know you'd like to make them do that, so that would be awesome.
[01:23.21]I also saw there was a $5 donation from Sean Bud.
[01:26.90]Real?
[01:27.86]Real bud?
[01:28.85]Real bud.
[01:29.67]Did he have a sassy note?
[01:30.79]He better.
[01:32.07]There was one from Coffee Burger, $5.
[01:34.21]I said my previous donation was my last one, but also said he would donate a yoppy one, so.
[01:40.04]Honestly, the more people, the better it is.
[01:44.81]Whoa, that made a cool sound.
[01:50.24]Refreshing.
[01:52.26]Refreshing.
[01:54.04]I'm a slave to the machine.
[01:56.82]I can only think as fast as the iPad refreshes.
[01:59.35]As many people as possible can play.
[02:03.95]Five bucks from Sean, bud.
[02:06.22]Ster, please play TF2.
[02:08.22]Parentheses Titanfall 2.
[02:10.94]You can't.
[02:11.71]You can't.
[02:13.35]People that aren't even here can play.
[02:14.71]People that aren't even here can surpass TF2 and how unplayable it is.
[02:18.26]It's honestly staggering.
[02:21.46]Every acronym that's TF2 is just unplayable.
[02:24.43]It's doomed.
[02:26.10]Anonymous $30.
[02:27.26]Only been watching for the past three years.
[02:30.17]You guys are all legends for putting this event on year after year.
[02:32.82]Sad to see it come to an end, but wild how much money has been raised for a great cause.
[02:36.50]Absolutely.
[02:37.14]Especially if you add up all the years we've done a pretty awesome thing here and everybody who's donated got to be a part of that.
[02:42.98]To Bunny, $25, not everything lasts forever, but the moments created will last more than a lifetime.
[02:48.94]Also tell Tag I said hi.
[02:51.31]Wait, that's hi with one, it's hard to count I's, a lot of I's.
[02:55.67]Tell him hi.
[02:56.41]How do you pronounce that, hi?
[02:57.86]Hi.
[02:58.86]I think.
[02:59.40]I think so.
[02:59.92]Captain has $15, also just says hi, but his hi is normal.
[03:05.07]Alright, let's get this.
[03:06.11]Are you in?
[03:07.21]Top of the morning.
[03:08.77]Top of the morning.
[03:09.17]Let's do it, dude.
[03:10.87]Okay, but if we're on our phones, we can't look at the screen because that's kind of cheating.
[03:15.00]Only the guy on the screen can look at it.
[03:17.32]You're on the screen.
[03:18.14]I'm on the screen.
[03:18.90]I'm writing a sentence.
[03:19.50]Everyone else, we look at the device.
[03:21.06]What is my sentence for?
[03:22.96]Someone has to draw it.
[03:24.69]It's a random person who will have to draw it.
[03:26.73]So whatever you want someone to draw.
[03:28.03]I'm on the spot.
[03:28.69]I'm on the spot so hard.
[03:29.89]And you all can't look at this.
[03:38.92]And there's gonna be like a little timer, so you can see how much time you have left in the upper right, I think.
[03:44.00]Oh, yeah.
[03:45.39]They've tactfully given you just a circle, they don't give you the actual number.
[03:49.35]Yeah, they don't give you the amount of time.
[03:50.85]Kind of a broken sentence.
[03:53.88]Phone call.
[03:57.38]I should probably turn them off.
[04:00.11]Kurt, you're getting a call.
[04:03.21]Hello?
[04:05.51]Okay.
[04:08.55]What?
[04:10.33]Now you have to draw, guys.
[04:11.37]Oh, God.
[04:13.20]So everybody's drawing.
[04:17.06]Sitting here while they're drawing.
[04:18.16]Oh, no.
[04:20.00]How do I undo?
[04:20.52]Watching Wyatt walk by while they're drawing.
[04:24.01]He stopped walking, so I lied to everybody.
[04:27.79]He's here as part of a live event.
[04:29.39]We did a giveaway where one kid would get to watch the event live.
[04:32.40]He's just hanging out.
[04:36.82]Cashing it in.
[04:40.27]I think you have to draw.
[04:41.04]Oh, God!
[04:43.68]Do I have to draw my own?
[04:44.90]Someone else wrote something.
[04:46.22]How do I draw with a trackpad?
[04:50.12]I don't even know what this means.
[04:51.83]Well, you gotta figure it out.
[04:53.05]I can't look.
[04:53.53]I can't help you.
[04:55.29]Dude.
[04:55.93]You have to click and drag.
[04:57.85]I'm trying.
[04:58.73]Oh, man.
[05:02.38]I thought that I was the operator.
[05:05.60]I'm just having a fun time.
[05:06.90]You're on the other end of the phone.
[05:09.16]He thought he was the phone operator.
[05:15.47]And then once you're done, you got to make sure to hit the submit or like the check.
[05:28.26]Watch my drawings.
[05:28.88]They'll be better than all of you.
[05:30.78]I will destroy you.
[05:34.75]Yes.
[05:36.53]I don't know, I'm a pretty good finger drawer.
[05:46.73]They give us a lot of time.
[05:49.17]Yeah.
[05:49.65]There's a speedrun mode where you don't get any time.
[05:53.04]We can play that.
[05:55.10]Maybe that's next round.
[05:55.96]That might be next round.
[06:02.44]I mean, I've never drawn with a trackpad before, but I'm pretty proud.
[06:05.73]I keep getting really tempted to look up.
[06:06.85]You get experience because you get to draw more.
[06:08.78]We have two more people finishing up.
[06:11.84]I edited mine a little bit, you know?
[06:13.75]Alright, one more.
[06:14.59]Oh, yeah, one person's still working on it.
[06:17.90]I'm so tempted to look up.
[06:20.64]I know, I'm looking at the wall.
[06:22.42]If I see someone look up, I'm jabbing.
[06:24.57]I did for a second, but my mind was blank.
[06:28.63]Not necessarily the person that looked up.
[06:30.43]If you look... Oh my gosh, somebody's very good at drawing.
[06:42.01]What are we looking at here, everyone?
[06:46.80]What in the world could this possibly be?
[06:50.01]Who drew this?
[07:02.01]Who are the artists in this game?
[07:04.11]I don't know.
[07:04.85]I don't even know who all is in the game.
[07:07.56]We have nine people.
[07:08.94]Everyone's phone ringing all the time.
[07:11.86]Jazz might be one of the good artists.
[07:15.27]Oh, no.
[07:16.03]Oh, my God.
[07:17.07]We're going through everybody.
[07:18.36]He gets to draw everyone's thing.
[07:19.64]Somebody gave up so early.
[07:20.82]Okay.
[07:21.92]Somebody gave up in like...
[07:23.56]Like the first drawing.
[07:25.86]It's funny because the further you go on, the more it devolves.
[07:28.82]Yeah.
[07:30.05]And we're like halfway through.
[07:30.95]Man, I would love to not be on a trackpad.
[07:35.03]Can you like go back?
[07:36.74]Like an undo?
[07:38.42]I don't know.
[07:39.02]There might be one.
[07:40.40]You have to draw over it with white.
[07:41.96]I think if you hit the pencil, there might be an undo.
[07:44.49]Oh, is there?
[07:45.11]Oh, you're right.
[07:45.99]Yeah.
[07:46.39]And then you can redo.
[07:47.35]There's like a fill tool and shapes and stuff.
[07:49.35]There's a fill tool?
[07:50.33]Yeah.
[07:50.79]Oh, that would have been nice.
[07:52.32]Yeah.
[07:52.58]Yeah, that would have been nice for the other one for sure.
[07:54.91]Okay, this is a bit of a disaster.
[08:07.31]Everyone is in like ultimate focus mode.
[08:09.53]It gets totally quiet.
[08:13.25]Yeah, but this is all build up.
[08:15.64]See, the outcome is, that's what we're doing this for.
[08:25.13]I mean, somebody just gave me no choice for what I needed to draw, so.
[08:29.64]Very unfortunate.
[08:30.30]I should be a professional at this one.
[08:35.11]Give you no choice.
[08:36.71]That was probably mine.
[08:38.06]I didn't even finish my other sentence.
[08:40.20]Wait, where's Phil?
[08:43.75]I've created a monster.
[08:47.46]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[08:48.34]Is there any benefit to being done early?
[08:50.55]I don't think so.
[08:51.05]No, because you'd have to wait anyways, so.
[08:54.32]You get Garthic points.
[08:56.14]Yeah, so I'll just keep doing something.
[09:04.67]Yeah doing good Classic naruto yes this chat to see what you're what you're doing I feel very bad because I Did not do a good job of representing the person in question I
[09:27.77]I mean, there's somebody here.
[09:31.58]I apologize in advance.
[09:33.32]I just had an epiphany.
[09:34.44]I've been doing the trackpad and holding down left click with the same hand when I could just hold it down and draw.
[09:40.57]Yeah, you could definitely do that.
[09:42.55]I'm going to have to do some explaining later.
[09:45.94]Describe.
[09:47.72]Describe.
[09:51.93]Wait, I think this is the one that I wrote earlier.
[09:57.78]Unless someone else was as uncreative as I was, that would have to be the case.
[10:10.94]Oh, I have a good one.
[10:14.79]What round is this, 5?
[10:17.49]Yeah, this is 5.
[10:25.10]I got that one in the last second.
[10:27.16]Wait, what?
[10:28.07]Someone didn't finish typing?
[10:29.49]There's just like a word that's unfinished in here.
[10:35.46]I'm not gonna lie, that could just be mine, but I'm not sure.
[10:41.53]I don't know what happened here.
[10:43.43]Oh no, this is exposing my awful drawing so badly.
[10:47.02]Wait, how did I get to white?
[10:49.04]Oh no, what do I do here?
[10:50.00]What do I do here?
[10:51.80]I'm on eraser.
[10:54.13]This is rigged.
[10:55.21]No, there's a, you go to the bottom left.
[10:57.19]Are you looking?
[10:58.01]No, I'm letting you know right here.
[11:00.64]Okay, now I figured it out.
[11:01.96]Yeah.
[11:15.61]Trying to do these justice.
[11:17.51]I thought I was just going to go for some simple ones.
[11:30.94]How do people have time to put color in theirs?
[11:33.19]Actually, I guess I could.
[11:36.63]There's a fill tool.
[11:41.52]Oh, no.
[11:42.56]That's not what I wanted.
[11:48.31]Oh, no.
[11:59.59]I mean, I guess I do have time to put color in.
[12:02.77]But I can't.
[12:04.34]I can't.
[12:06.91]Can't do it.
[12:07.47]You're just choosing not to?
[12:09.43]I mean, it would take... I don't think I have the time.
[12:11.75]And the trackpad is, you know... Not behaving?
[12:16.04]Kind of my enemy.
[12:16.88]Do we still have time?
[12:18.04]Oh, there's like shape tools.
[12:19.32]I didn't even look.
[12:20.20]I wasn't even a part of this.
[12:21.25]There's fill.
[12:21.93]Yeah, you said that.
[12:24.07]There's a whole like metagame level strategy.
[12:25.91]There's phones ringing.
[12:27.57]There's operators.
[12:30.75]Which you are not one of.
[12:31.91]Yeah, you're not one of them.
[12:32.91]Okay.
[12:33.35]Thank you for reminding me.
[12:35.01]Maybe we're all operators.
[12:36.56]No, what just happened?
[12:37.54]No.
[12:39.00]Hello?
[12:39.74]Tip of the hat's answering.
[12:41.20]How can I help?
[12:45.45]You seem to be a sussy baka.
[12:52.38]Is that funny?
[12:52.94]Because I'm just saying words kids say.
[12:54.80]I found out what that is today.
[12:57.22]I don't know what is happening.
[13:00.50]Me neither.
[13:05.51]I need some guidance.
[13:07.79]I need some direction.
[13:14.98]Did something happen with crabs in the last Mario Party game?
[13:19.16]Crabs?
[13:19.38]No.
[13:20.06]What?
[13:21.29]Wait, what?
[13:22.63]There were not crabs in the Mario Party game.
[13:25.55]I have no idea why this picture took place then.
[13:29.00]The only thing that happened in Mario Party was the most undeserved win of all time.
[13:34.77]Do not allow... Wait, what is... What?
[13:42.91]Oh, my God.
[13:43.55]After the last one, I was like, wait.
[13:45.25]I thought I was writing description again.
[13:47.53]I was like, okay.
[13:48.92]Chat knows why I'm confused.
[13:50.80]Some of them might not.
[13:53.06]Go on.
[13:57.79]Oh, that's complicated.
[14:03.60]I mean, are you not allowed to write letters?
[14:06.09]Is that kind of a Pictionary rule here?
[14:08.25]I think so.
[14:08.99]I think that would be uncouth.
[14:09.93]No way this is happening to me.
[14:11.90]I'm actually crushing this.
[14:14.10]You know what?
[14:14.50]Never mind.
[14:17.07]I was born to do this.
[14:19.53]My phone's case is not letting me get to the very edge of the screen.
[14:22.77]Yeah, you gotta pull it back.
[14:23.95]I know.
[14:24.53]This is just too much for me.
[14:26.60]I can't handle this.
[14:27.18]You don't have enough rows.
[14:33.25]Going back in the womb.
[14:36.55]How seriously have people been answering?
[14:37.99]Have they been trying to be funny?
[14:40.12]I mean, I'm trying to answer based on what I see.
[14:42.24]Yeah, me too.
[14:43.32]I think it's just falling apart.
[14:53.83]I'm proud of myself.
[14:55.98]I haven't looked up.
[14:59.44]If you do, you never will again.
[15:02.47]Me or Clockwork.
[15:03.27]It's random.
[15:03.99]Which of us won't be?
[15:06.51]Which of us was going to get the jab?
[15:09.70]Wait, what are we talking about?
[15:11.78]I have no idea what you just said.
[15:14.61]Don't worry about it.
[15:15.35]I have literally no idea what you just said.
[15:21.12]That made it worse.
[15:27.47]Trying to do, like, scribble.
[15:30.53]We only have one more round after this.
[15:32.79]The big conclusion.
[15:34.00]Someone's calling?
[15:35.58]Who is it?
[15:37.50]Operator.
[15:39.70]Tip of the hat.
[15:42.45]Hi, this is Tip of the Hat speaking.
[15:54.46]He's laughing in the background.
[15:59.01]Oh my gosh.
[16:03.50]Are you come over here and look?
[16:04.96]Bam!
[16:05.51]I'm getting Uberchains and Jazz's drawings, I'm pretty sure.
[16:13.68]Yeah.
[16:15.26]Somebody is quite the artist.
[16:27.62]I don't think we have to draw after this, so once this is over, it should show the album.
[16:31.58]Yeah.
[16:32.40]We see where we started and how far we've come.
[16:37.75]Or how far we've fallen, one or the other.
[16:41.63]Okay, we get the albums.
[16:43.99]Alright, so how do I work this on the main display?
[16:46.74]Auto, manual.
[16:48.32]You probably want to do manual, yeah, that way we can look at the drawings.
[16:50.46]And we can go, do you want to do it?
[16:54.44]Automatic voiceover.
[16:55.66]I want to hear those.
[16:56.59]And start at the beginning.
[16:59.67]Yeah, start at the beginning, probably.
[17:01.13]Okay, let's go.
[17:01.83]Alright, we're starting with the Ster album.
[17:04.63]Ster's album.
[17:06.24]Oh, you got to click on it, I think.
[17:07.40]Show.
[17:08.48]Dancing bird erupts in candy.
[17:12.73]Oh, I got a clue.
[17:13.83]This is hard.
[17:14.57]This is rough.
[17:16.60]That's pretty good.
[17:18.40]I had no idea what that was.
[17:21.89]Chicken.
[17:25.56]I had chicken at disco written out, but it didn't finish in time, so it just said chicken.
[17:36.51]I was like, chicken?
[17:38.23]The text-to-speech really sold that one.
[17:40.45]It said chicken.
[17:41.44]Okay, Kurt, what did you think of that?
[17:43.06]I said, farmer!
[17:47.44]Yeah, time to add a farmer.
[17:51.91]A man with a pitchfork poking the tip of the hat's burp.
[17:58.76]Oh god.
[18:00.59]Oh no!
[18:05.09]Always goes to violence, doesn't it?
[18:07.07]Burp abuse frown.
[18:10.56]Oh, burp abuse.
[18:14.46]Oh no!
[18:15.02]He dropped his ice cream.
[18:19.49]Sad Toph burp drops his cone.
[18:23.44]That's a good album, actually.
[18:25.10]Yeah, I'm kind of depressed after that one.
[18:26.89]I was a big fan of the chicken.
[18:29.76]I am, Harsha.
[18:31.19]How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
[18:34.10]Oh, I think I drew one of these.
[18:36.91]It did not end like this.
[18:41.03]It definitely did not end like this, I'll tell you that much.
[18:43.60]Is that a woodchuck?
[18:45.78]What is that?
[18:47.00]It's chucking wood.
[18:48.04]Is it a catapult?
[18:48.69]It's a catapult chucking wood.
[18:52.61]Throwing wood.
[18:56.26]Yeah, I think it's... I don't know, maybe...
[19:00.58]I just want you to know a tomato gets involved in here somewhere.
[19:07.73]I don't know how it just happens to faced person What do we got?
[19:23.34]That's where it came from.
[19:38.12]I knew it was in there.
[19:42.55]Oh my god.
[19:47.00]That's pretty close to what I did.
[19:48.74]That is pretty good.
[19:49.64]Man with tomato head throwing a log.
[19:54.41]What did that start at?
[19:55.69]How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
[20:00.56]There are no winners.
[20:02.56]The tip of the hats bird smile.
[20:04.99]Smile.
[20:05.61]Smile.
[20:11.57]What happened there with that drawing I have no idea Come on it devolves from here Nothing
[20:40.72]Nothing?
[20:44.79]No!
[20:45.75]No way!
[20:48.75]I see.
[20:51.66]I understand now.
[20:58.30]My eyes.
[21:03.85]Staring at the sun.
[21:05.19]That started with the thought bird.
[21:06.25]It started with a bird?
[21:08.45]And it turned into that?
[21:10.01]It was the most basic thing you could choose.
[21:12.84]It's literally just a bird.
[21:14.54]I messed up the right, like I didn't finish this one, I don't think.
[21:17.80]I didn't have time.
[21:19.00]To finish your first one?
[21:19.94]The sentence, I mean.
[21:21.09]Like, it's probably just like a random word and I don't even know where it was.
[21:23.19]Scorpion's Earth card.
[21:26.45]Okay.
[21:28.83]I don't know what a Z car is.
[21:33.18]I don't know this, whatever this is.
[21:38.52]And that was also my first drawing, so I wasn't good.
[21:43.55]Ster on the floor with a crab.
[21:45.39]Oh, this is, I need to apologize because I tried to give you a beard, but it didn't work out.
[21:53.95]You can't write Ster.
[21:57.32]That's cheating.
[21:58.58]You're banned.
[21:59.50]Hey, I did it because someone else did it in one of their drawings.
[22:02.20]I won't use words anymore.
[22:04.12]Ster is dead.
[22:05.11]Crab.
[22:07.19]Oh my.
[22:08.71]No more words.
[22:12.51]F. Crab defeats Italian.
[22:22.40]Oh no.
[22:29.16]Oh no.
[22:34.17]Crab killed the demoman.
[22:35.99]Oh no.
[22:38.95]What was the start of that one?
[22:40.84]Scorpions are a Z-car.
[22:43.22]I mean, it's a crab still.
[22:44.90]That's pretty close.
[22:45.95]What's a Z-car?
[22:47.15]It's supposed to be scary.
[22:49.51]It was like a typo.
[22:51.31]Oh, okay.
[22:51.64]I thought it was really like, I'm just not gonna know.
[22:53.06]I was trying to rush it to finish it, and it was Z-car.
[22:55.46]My butt hurts.
[22:57.79]Okay.
[22:58.87]This one, I'm sure...
[23:01.98]Is that a what?
[23:08.56]What is that?
[23:08.85]Can we get some, in the chat, some parentheses, hashtag parentheses, ow?
[23:15.43]The hashtag is the injury.
[23:17.94]Yes, clearly.
[23:19.08]We all got that.
[23:20.06]That was very obvious.
[23:21.20]Hashtag ow.
[23:23.91]Painful hashtag.
[23:26.97]That's actually pretty good.
[23:30.54]I like that.
[23:31.86]Violent spreadsheets.
[23:34.40]That makes sense.
[23:37.27]Oh, I understand now.
[23:42.41]No.
[23:43.70]Expert use of the line tool.
[23:45.30]I feel like a fool now.
[23:46.42]A bingo board with ketchup on it.
[23:49.12]A bingo board with ketchup on it.
[23:50.68]I didn't know what that was.
[23:51.39]I thought it was bingo.
[23:57.73]When bingo gets horribly violent.
[23:59.72]Nice.
[24:00.56]What did that start with?
[24:02.10]Uh, good question.
[24:03.66]My butt hurts!
[24:06.23]Well, your butt got hurt playing Bingo.
[24:10.73]Feel the tip of the hat's bird eating pancakes.
[24:16.42]I forgot the bird part!
[24:20.68]I definitely know why I was drawing what I was drawing.
[24:25.69]Eating pancakes.
[24:27.27]That's a lot of exclamation points.
[24:31.01]That's more of a bird!
[24:33.47]It's a bird!
[24:33.79]How did the bird come back?
[24:35.23]The bird is back.
[24:36.29]Yeah, it made its return.
[24:38.44]Stags delicious pancakes.
[24:40.76]And now it's gone.
[24:41.34]Now it's gone.
[24:44.58]Oh, that's pretty good.
[24:45.63]I like that.
[24:46.21]I made sure to make them look delicious.
[24:48.93]Stack of pancakes.
[24:52.85]Are we going to keep the pancakes?
[24:55.66]Is that a hat?
[24:56.32]Nice.
[24:56.88]No, it's a butter.
[24:59.59]Pancakes not accurate to the beginning, but what was the beginning?
[25:04.17]Well, they were paying getting was a bird eating a pancake.
[25:07.68]Oh, it's close We don't actually good.
[25:12.33]Mm-hmm Kind of hard to mess up pancakes
[25:14.95]Cockroach fishing on a bank.
[25:17.11]What?
[25:17.75]I don't know.
[25:18.45]Apparently it was a cockroach.
[25:19.55]Check it out, though.
[25:25.46]No, it looks like a rabbit.
[25:26.56]People thought that was a rabbit.
[25:28.18]Bunny rabbit goes fishing.
[25:33.91]Whoa.
[25:35.99]What?
[25:36.41]I tried to embarrass everyone.
[25:38.21]You just took your whole time with that.
[25:41.25]Bunny fishing with their fish friend.
[25:46.22]What do we got here?
[25:48.78]Oh!
[25:50.54]Wait, the fish is fishing!
[25:56.23]What happened?
[25:56.99]This is the ears!
[25:57.85]This is the ears!
[26:00.59]Wait, wasn't it also you who drew the bird as a person?
[26:03.68]No, no, no, no.
[26:04.58]I did that.
[26:05.20]Your perspective in these drawings is insane to me.
[26:08.68]You draw from like a four... It's so interesting.
[26:11.38]Fishing.
[26:15.80]He's got a hat.
[26:17.44]The hat's when you have extra time.
[26:18.71]Abraham Lincoln catching a fish.
[26:22.37]Yeah, I ran out of time, so I give him a hat.
[26:26.84]Is this the last one?
[26:29.42]I think I'm last.
[26:29.86]Yeah, I think we might have a few more.
[26:31.17]Oh, there's a scroll.
[26:32.11]Phil doing a cool dance.
[26:34.57]Alright, let's see some Phil.
[26:38.45]Fort.
[26:38.99]Fort.
[26:40.23]Fort.
[26:40.95]Oh, we got it.
[26:44.58]That's pretty good.
[26:50.78]That's good.
[26:53.59]Dancing bird does not exist.
[26:56.01]Yeah, that's why I was confused.
[26:57.59]It's not a word.
[26:58.87]That's the one I finished at the absolute deadline.
[27:02.62]Yeah, I mean, apparently.
[27:06.36]No dancing.
[27:12.49]This was a good description of this for sure.
[27:16.85]Do not allow Phil the Robin to combust in the sun.
[27:27.58]Robin relaxing in the sun.
[27:31.39]Nice.
[27:31.67]That's pretty good.
[27:35.29]Top of the morning.
[27:38.19]That's why I wrote a word.
[27:45.86]I was like, what do I do with this?
[27:47.56]I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[27:49.63]Not the morning at all.
[27:51.25]Not the morning at all.
[27:52.55]Don't do that.
[27:57.32]That's pretty good.
[27:59.52]Alright.
[28:00.00]I might have taken this in a different direction.
[28:01.99]Werewolf.
[28:06.54]That's pretty good.
[28:26.70]I don't know who Michael is park cat looks quite dapper
[28:32.03]That was a reference to the Pico Park from earlier.
[28:34.88]There's other modes if you want to do, like, a speedrun mode or other stuff.
[28:40.91]Like, speedrun's just less time.
[28:42.37]I'm okay with whatever.
[28:44.83]We should get more people.
[28:46.63]Yeah, we can get more people in.
[28:47.94]Before we move to the next one, I'm going to try and read some donations because we're going to be silent mode for a while.
[28:55.01]Yeah, we need to rejoin, I think.
[28:56.55]Yeah, because it timed out or something.
[28:59.01]Oh, do I need to invite?
[29:00.07]Okay, I'm...
[29:02.36]If you like just go back like I just went back into the Discord and just like re-clicked the link and it worked.
[29:09.70]Stankzilla, 30 bucks, love you fives.
[29:13.39]It's like someone was participating and misspelled everything.
[29:16.78]Thank you, Stankzilla.
[29:18.48]Telemachus, 25 bucks, no message, thank you very much.
[29:21.70]MoodleCat, 25 bucks.
[29:23.66]Hey, gamers, glad I'm able to be here with everyone for the last event.
[29:26.81]What TipaHatz has done over the years is incredibly kind and impressive.
[29:30.07]Missing those that were... Are you talking over me?
[29:33.39]Oh, my bad.
[29:38.58]I forgot about that.
[29:41.68]Missing those that were able to be a part of this year's event, but you're all appreciated.
[29:44.96]As always, TothSussy, smile.
[29:47.22]As always.
[29:47.95]As always, TothSussy.
[29:49.03]As always.
[29:49.97]Even when Tip of the Hats doesn't come back, as always.
[29:54.09]Dark, $100.
[29:56.06]I've made it a goal since 2014 to donate $100 and get a shirt every year.
[30:01.42]It's been a rough two years, but I managed to put some money aside to keep this tradition going.
[30:05.71]Best of luck everyone hosting and stream.
[30:08.01]Keep your heads up for the keep moving forward.
[30:10.47]PS for the kids.
[30:12.14]Hey, if you weren't able to get all the shirts, it's only a $10 incentive to get every single shirt.
[30:18.32]So if you get any sort of donation in, $10, you can put it towards that incentive.
[30:22.27]Make sure you... You get history.
[30:24.51]A piece of history, really.
[30:27.02]Sketch check.
[30:28.32]$100, no message.
[30:29.58]Thank you very much.
[30:31.64]Now I'm excited to get back on this garlic phone.
[30:36.49]Am I just starting?
[30:37.73]How many people?
[30:38.35]That's a lot of people.
[30:39.29]I think we're still getting people in.
[30:41.79]We got 11.
[30:44.96]Should we bring in Jill?
[30:46.98]Oh, he's in.
[30:47.96]Are you in?
[30:49.22]I'm in.
[30:49.58]Nice.
[30:50.75]Oh, yeah.
[30:51.19]I see you.
[30:56.73]Oh, try hard.
[30:58.08]Trying to win this one too.
[30:59.20]He's got the stylus.
[31:04.93]Nice.
[31:06.24]Alright, we have 12 in?
[31:08.48]We have 12 in.
[31:10.54]Alright, we can start, I guess.
[31:12.05]Okay.
[31:13.85]Should we do a different mode?
[31:15.47]No, I think we're going to do this one.
[31:16.89]I think we're all quite content.
[31:18.38]Yeah?
[31:18.86]Okay.
[31:19.56]Did you turn your mic back on?
[31:20.94]You good?
[31:21.70]Wait, can you hear me?
[31:23.66]No, no one can hear anyone.
[31:25.41]I'm just asking in case you forgot.
[31:26.67]Alright, everyone.
[31:32.50]Your best sentence.
[31:35.92]From where?
[32:04.27]Remember that we're being timed, everybody.
[32:06.51]Yeah, yeah, you're on a timer.
[32:08.52]There's a length limit.
[32:13.16]Kurt!
[32:14.14]It's ringing.
[32:15.12]Tried to go with something people could draw.
[32:16.69]If you look at that screen.
[32:18.19]I did, I did, but I didn't.
[32:19.67]I swear my mind was blank.
[32:21.61]Oh.
[32:22.57]As always.
[32:23.09]As always.
[32:25.20]Oh, this is an interesting one.
[32:30.34]Okay.
[32:32.65]I don't actually know what he looks like.
[32:41.42]How do I not know?
[32:58.81]What was that noise?
[33:01.09]I have no idea.
[33:01.79]This is not it!
[33:14.89]I cannot believe how many times I've messed up this very simple drawing.
[33:20.00]I know he's got one of these.
[33:24.63]Sure, sure.
[33:31.57]Oh, oh wait, okay.
[33:32.93]I'm like nervous that time's running out.
[33:34.51]I'm used to these kind of games giving you like five seconds.
[33:41.22]Okay, hopefully mine is good enough.
[33:42.58]I regret my choice on how to draw this.
[34:02.94]Is Fender in this one?
[34:05.26]Did you just... I glanced upwards.
[34:07.66]Bam!
[34:08.18]There we go.
[34:11.43]To be honest, I didn't see anything on the screen, though.
[34:14.53]That kind of hurt my feelings.
[34:20.00]I feel like I'm learning.
[34:24.11]I'm so sorry about this.
[34:25.41]I don't even know if the stream can hear the phone.
[34:30.97]I'm content.
[34:37.56]Yeah, let's just forget I ever... Oh, whoops, I made a dot.
[34:40.76]This might be my best drawing yet.
[34:41.78]That dot's going to be interpreted until the very end.
[34:45.25]The dot's going to be the most important part.
[34:46.83]Yeah, like, what does that mean?
[34:49.94]Oh.
[34:50.72]Ooh.
[34:52.32]I found the dot.
[34:56.39]Oh.
[35:08.83]You don't have as much time on this one, so yeah, make sure to get the words in.
[35:23.63]I feel like Apollo for the win is driving this permanent tattoo mark.
[35:31.56]Every time I look over it, you're announcing how far away we are.
[35:34.21]Like, come on, guys.
[35:35.45]I'm cheating.
[35:41.11]I might, like, scar someone trying to draw this.
[35:57.21]Be very delicate.
[36:00.44]What is this, Photoshop?
[36:01.34]It doesn't fill correctly?
[36:03.78]Nice job, Adobe.
[36:05.89]It's been how many years?
[36:29.63]No, I lost the plan.
[36:35.56]There's no way to... I want to know who wrote this.
[36:43.05]I want to know who cursed the rest of these images.
[36:48.28]I like how you can tell when the prompt is already griefed.
[36:53.68]By the time it gets to you.
[36:56.15]No way that just happened.
[36:58.50]No one's gonna know what these are.
[37:00.15]I don't even.
[37:02.45]I'm trying to peel my phone case back.
[37:12.51]Oh, God.
[37:17.00]No way.
[37:18.50]Dude, this fill is like, it's like paint.
[37:20.84]It's like trolling me over and over.
[37:22.05]It literally leaves pixels unpainted on purpose.
[37:24.53]Yes, that, and I also can't finish, like, I'm making the whole thing.
[37:30.32]Oh, hello, tip of the hat's here.
[37:31.72]No one can hear it.
[37:32.74]Can you guys confirm if you can even hear this?
[37:39.25]What's chat saying?
[37:41.29]Oh, they might give me a hint of what you're doing.
[37:44.50]They said abstract chocolate.
[37:46.02]I don't know.
[37:48.08]No one is going to know what this is at all.
[37:51.37]There's zero chance.
[37:52.41]We can, we can, we can, we can't, we have, okay.
[37:54.97]Tip of the hats here, taking all calls.
[37:57.12]Caller, what's your issue?
[38:01.68]Oh, I have no idea what this is.
[38:07.99]We're not even halfway through and it's already just a disaster.
[38:22.66]Feel good about that one.
[38:23.96]Feel like I put in a hard day's work on that one.
[38:26.93]Yeah.
[38:28.15]You feel proud of yourself?
[38:29.03]I do.
[38:29.77]I feel like I really nailed it.
[38:34.66]You have to... You have to hit some good adjectives.
[38:39.44]I didn't finish it!
[38:40.67]Oh, no.
[38:46.50]Oh, no.
[38:51.19]Okay, we got a lot of work ahead of us.
[38:53.78]No way, that just happened again.
[39:05.33]He's trying so hard.
[39:06.23]Nobody knows why I said that.
[39:12.83]Yeah, Bren is drawing on a stylus right now.
[39:16.34]Yeah, give me a stylus, I will destroy you in this unscored game.
[39:21.06]I'm getting so trolled by this fill option.
[39:31.38]It's crazy.
[39:41.73]A lot of efficient circle tool use out there.
[39:44.75]Yeah.
[39:44.99]Oh, is it good?
[39:46.53]I haven't used the circle tool.
[39:48.39]I would encourage you to...
[39:52.75]Use it copiously?
[39:53.72]Use it.
[39:54.64]I would encourage some.
[39:59.76]I feel like you lose a little bit of the heart of the image.
[40:02.71]You start using circles for everything.
[40:04.99]You lose a little bit of what really makes it you.
[40:09.34]Exactly.
[40:10.74]Some of the wabi-sabi in it.
[40:12.82]The wabi-sabi?
[40:14.07]Yeah.
[40:15.49]Big fan.
[40:16.43]Those imperfections are what give character.
[40:18.45]Yes.
[40:20.21]Okay, that...
[40:22.20]Is there an undo?
[40:24.02]There is an undo.
[40:24.93]I have the power!
[40:25.57]There is an undo.
[40:27.93]There is for me because I have a keyboard.
[40:29.80]No, there's an undo in general.
[40:32.60]Yeah, I've been grinding the undo.
[40:34.46]Yeah, it's been there.
[40:36.93]It's one of the tools in the fill area.
[40:39.95]Yes, tip of the hat's here.
[40:43.34]That'll never get old.
[40:47.73]You can't hear the rest for sure, but throughout the entire house, it's like one rings, one rings, one rings, echoing.
[40:54.52]I just turned the sound off on my phone.
[40:56.52]Maybe I should turn it back on.
[40:58.14]Yeah, let's get more ringing in here.
[41:00.22]Yeah, get more ringing in here.
[41:05.19]I tried my best.
[41:09.69]Oh, my God.
[41:12.48]Why did I get this?
[41:12.94]Are you okay?
[41:14.62]What are you guys drawing?
[41:16.69]Don't worry about it.
[41:18.17]Don't worry about it.
[41:19.79]It's all good.
[41:33.49]Like typing an essay over there.
[41:34.95]I'm just hearing the keyboard.
[41:39.30]There's a lot going on.
[41:47.66]What I don't get is how some of you guys are getting several minutes to draw, and that's what I got.
[41:52.14]I made a typo.
[41:53.56]Why did somebody do this?
[42:01.27]I don't know what's happening.
[42:12.98]Oh, if you don't close the lines, it's so annoying to fill.
[42:20.53]I... I have the power!
[42:26.14]What is this?
[42:26.74]Um... Ah!
[42:41.33]Ah!
[42:46.38]You ever get scared by drawing?
[42:50.41]Every day.
[42:51.20]What about the drawing is scaring you?
[42:53.28]I accidentally filled everything.
[43:01.99]Okay, I have a play.
[43:13.53]Okay.
[43:26.93]Is there like no purple You have to actually mix colors difficulty I was looking for purple There's like kind of like it's like a maroon that's probably as close as you can get Oh No those wrong color
[43:56.78]Dude, Bren is really going at it over there.
[43:58.99]He's got his head down, he's got the tablet out.
[44:01.25]This is the hardest I've seen Bren work.
[44:03.23]I feel like if someone gets this one I just did, then there's some sort of donation I need to do.
[44:11.68]Oh, no.
[44:12.96]Like, on a sliding scale of accuracy.
[44:15.00]You got two seconds, Glock.
[44:16.06]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[44:18.48]Oh.
[44:18.56]I was filling random things.
[44:20.81]What?
[44:21.41]How could... Oh, this is upsetting.
[44:25.37]Um...
[44:30.30]This is upsetting.
[44:31.12]Why would somebody do this?
[44:34.41]Was that close, chat?
[44:45.04]Were we good on that?
[44:51.73]I'm not gonna have time.
[44:55.10]Oh, no, I'm committed.
[44:56.84]This is a disaster Whoever made this prompt is playing a dangerous game
[45:19.27]Focus on the prize.
[45:54.25]I feel very bad about myself every time I use one of the shape tools.
[46:02.56]Sometimes it must be done.
[46:10.09]Fender, you're wandering around not drawing, and I just feel very sad for you.
[46:14.53]Sorry.
[46:15.43]I didn't know that I wasn't ready to draw.
[46:19.98]Oh.
[46:24.04]I think I'm going competitive.
[46:26.00]Competitive Gartic Phone?
[46:27.34]Yeah.
[46:28.66]Top 500.
[46:30.14]Oh.
[46:36.33]I don't know if there's more I can add.
[46:39.53]I feel like I've done God's work.
[46:40.75]I definitely did not.
[46:43.01]Yeah.
[46:44.67]I feel like I've made a distinct improvement from game one.
[46:47.50]There's no way anybody guesses what I just drew.
[46:50.54]And I'm sorry about that.
[46:56.00]But it wasn't an easy prompt, so I'm not that sorry.
[47:02.29]Okay.
[47:03.33]Okay.
[47:03.83]We're almost on the final round.
[47:05.81]We only have one more draw after this.
[47:07.22]But only four out of 12 people have finished this round.
[47:09.52]Yeah, and we're about to run out of time.
[47:15.29]Oh.
[47:15.57]I never actually clicked on.
[47:17.37]Oh.
[47:17.89]Oh.
[47:19.13]What?
[47:22.56]Huh?
[47:23.90]Oh, time.
[47:24.88]Oh, sh... I don't know what this is.
[47:29.61]I genuinely don't know what this is.
[47:39.37]I don't even have a guess.
[47:50.10]Okay, one more to go.
[47:52.10]Damn it.
[47:52.48]I read chat too late.
[47:53.60]You guys have some good ideas.
[47:57.55]Oh, my God.
[47:59.36]Yeah, we've officially, like, you play one game and everyone gets used to it.
[48:03.49]Let's just go off the rails.
[48:10.04]You know what, I'm purely using the circle tool as a display of my true art.
[48:17.79]Everything will be a circle, which is in itself its own skill.
[48:26.32]Is the circle tool really good?
[48:27.74]Yeah.
[48:27.92]Is it good?
[48:28.22]Yeah, I haven't been using it.
[48:29.48]It's useful, it's useful.
[48:30.51]I mean, they kind of always have to be facing one way, so I'm not very happy about that.
[48:36.45]You can extend them in different directions.
[48:41.63]Have you been circling incorrectly?
[48:43.46]I'm only circling one direction.
[48:45.60]How do you circle multiple, like, a different direction?
[48:49.76]It's a circle in all directions, isn't it?
[48:54.45]No.
[48:55.37]I mean, I don't think you understand.
[48:57.03]You're just not advanced.
[48:58.04]Sorry.
[48:58.90]Like, I can't... I mean, I can... It's... You wouldn't get it.
[49:06.27]Let's just be real.
[49:15.03]Why is there no, like, alt color?
[49:21.31]I have to forget this.
[49:22.27]This is my art form.
[49:24.21]Art is dead.
[49:26.54]Art is dead?
[49:27.04]Art's dead?
[49:28.15]Yeah.
[49:29.53]Dang.
[49:46.91]You want to toss it over here?
[49:48.49]Actually, I don't know if they can see.
[49:54.74]Can they see it?
[49:56.19]I don't know what kind of screen we're on right now.
[49:59.56]See what?
[50:00.22]Oh, nothing.
[50:01.12]Oh, okay.
[50:04.84]Okay.
[50:06.79]Alright, I think I'm in shambles.
[50:11.31]After this, I think we're good to look at the screen, right?
[50:13.64]I didn't look.
[50:14.68]And final round.
[50:15.44]Three, two, three.
[50:18.62]Three, two, one.
[50:18.96]Three, two, three.
[50:24.25]Alright.
[50:24.81]Alright, we still got all the same settings.
[50:27.80]I feel like I've improved.
[50:30.04]That's the Xbox.
[50:32.04]That's the Xbox.
[50:34.07]Wait, hold on.
[50:35.23]Oh, shit.

[64:13.79]Chocolate being pulled into a gaping black hole.
[64:17.11]This one... I don't know what happened here.
[64:20.49]I don't know what I drew for this.
[64:27.78]Black hole broadens its color palette.
[64:32.59]Now I know where this went.
[64:36.49]Oh, that's pretty good.
[64:39.42]Black hole absorbing a rainbow.
[64:46.01]Whoa, that's sick.
[64:47.91]What?

[64:51.23]Black hole consumed too many Skittles.
[64:54.49]Yep.
[64:56.30]That was a really good black hole.
[65:00.36]My social commentary.

[65:54.30]Very mad King K. Rool.
[65:56.02]Maybe Godzilla.
[65:59.14]I did my best.
[66:01.73]Not bad, actually.
[66:05.73]Not bad.
[66:05.91]That's a posture check.
[66:08.79]Knock off.

[67:09.01]Whisker drinks coffee creamer.
[67:10.83]Oh, I regret what I was trying to do with this picture.
[67:14.99]I tried to make the whiskey do it.
[67:29.48]You have to do something interesting.
[67:34.17]Drinking coffee isn't interesting?
[67:36.39]Well, is that the literal whisker?
[67:38.88]I'm putting a mustache.
[67:45.28]Oh, that's so good!
[67:48.94]Oh, that's actually really good.

[68:44.25]G's are a tricky letter.
[68:45.57]Yeah.
[68:47.50]Another?
[68:48.32]Is that it?
[68:48.72]This might be the last one.
[68:51.82]They all might be.
[68:52.78]The Mario does the Mario.
[68:53.62]I don't know what the Mario is.
[68:58.25]I don't either, to be honest.
[68:59.41]Oh, this is really good.
[69:01.92]I know where this went.
[69:06.25]Mr. Mario is shaking the booty.
[69:08.72]Here we go.

[69:50.92]Great job.
[69:58.90]Those aren't legs.
[70:00.44]That's a dolphin.
[70:03.90]Mario finds the wrong mushroom.

[75:12.75]Thank you, Hananas.
[75:14.08]So just a minute, Jerma's probably going to be coming over hosting the stream.
[75:18.89]We're going to get a last hurrah probably before the end of the night with some more garlic phone, which I keep saying the wrong name for on purpose because everyone's been having a fun time doing it.
[75:29.60]We figured it's something easy to just get him involved in and...
[75:34.60]Yeah, draw some more Marios or whatevers.
[75:39.59]In the meanwhile, if you haven't donated yet, we're probably ending after this segment.
[75:47.28]All donations will be counted until midnight tonight.
[75:49.58]If you want to get any incentives in, there's still the $10 for all seven of the t-shirts.
[75:54.73]There's $50 for the OLED new switch you can enter to get.
[76:00.06]Dr. Squeaks just gave 100 bucks.
[76:04.43]I'll figure out what that was all about in a second.
[76:09.10]He approaches.
[76:11.44]Yeah, he, Jerma was gonna, he was gonna be here live on set, but he said he had, like, he was driving his Lambo onto a yacht or something and had this whole, like, bikini party he had to go to.
[76:23.57]So.
[76:26.06]I don't know.
[76:28.64]What?
[76:30.62]What?
[76:36.41]Okay, we're just gonna chill for a few secs.
[76:39.62]Okay.
[76:41.72]Are we still doing that?
[76:44.60]Uh, no.
[76:47.31]Doing comedy.
[76:49.95]One sec.
[76:51.35]Uh oh.
[76:52.94]It's refreshing.
[77:04.13]What?
[77:06.25]uh sure muting yeah I can plug all the stuff don't worry we're good we're plugging it
[77:31.24]plug I got the plug dude he's got the plug it's on my phone it's the Gartic phone oh yeah I always call my Gartic phone for whatever I need need a Mario that's locked sure I got you yeah it's too bad there's not another tip of the hats because I'm sure all of these could have been t-shirts like I would buy a sussy Mario Baka and get sued by Nintendo yeah probably I mean they kind of you know they'll do that um
[78:06.57]around.
[78:09.37]Alright, so I think the Jerma raid is here.
[78:12.50]Welcome, all you germs and rats.
[78:15.46]We are tip of the hats.
[78:17.59]We're raising money for One Step Camp Charity.
[78:19.89]It is a camp where kids go if they have cancer just to be kids, to enjoy themselves.
[78:25.48]We raise money to make sure that they can go there and have a good time, be amongst other people who have gone through similar experiences to kind of take a little bit of a load off.
[78:33.29]Been doing it for several years, but this is the final event.
[78:38.40]And thank you, Jerma, for the raid.
[78:40.52]I think Jerma's actually going to come on and play a round of Gartic Phone with us.
[78:44.65]Yeah, so we just got done playing two rounds of this Gartic Phone.
[78:48.22]It's kind of like a Pictionary meets Dark Souls.
[78:53.04]Yeah, it's the Dark Souls of Pictionary.
[78:55.07]Yeah, just to pitch to all you guys to get you interested as quickly as I can.
[78:59.05]I felt like I was losing them.
[79:00.66]It is the Dark Souls of Pictionary.
[79:02.54]We had a blast.
[79:03.37]It's definitely been one of the more fun things we've done today.
[79:07.30]Just to throw everything else under the bus.
[79:10.08]Definitely.
[79:10.99]Sing the Raid song or write.
[79:12.49]Oh, you know the Raid song.
[79:13.65]You were singing it to me this morning.
[79:15.66]Oh, yeah, and Gio was doing it too, so you guys should sing together.
[79:19.25]It goes, Raid.
[79:22.10]Alright, there it is.
[79:23.16]There you go.
[79:23.86]There's the Raid song.
[79:24.72]Thanks.
[79:25.14]I think that's the intro sequence.
[79:26.83]I don't know.
[79:27.39]I've never played.
[79:29.31]I mean, it was a little bit better when you guys were doing it for me, but you know what?
[79:32.28]Well, we saved the best for you, Kurt.
[79:34.89]We'll do it again later.
[79:35.91]Yeah, we were at $44,591.
[79:38.27]There's a couple of incentives that still haven't been met.
[79:40.31]The big one was getting a permanent real tattoo on Bren.
[79:44.62]Yeah, and Jill's getting a permanent tattoo as well.
[79:46.94]And I think Kurt said that he wanted to if they both did because he just felt like it would be a fun thing to do.
[79:51.57]We were pretty close to that when we last left off.
[79:54.15]But, you know, just permanently impacting someone else's flesh is on the table for things that you could do tonight.
[80:01.10]And simultaneously, permanently impacting a camper.
[80:05.09]It's alive.
[80:06.05]Forever.
[80:06.63]In a positive way.
[80:08.38]Yeah.
[80:08.70]Sending some kids to camp.
[80:09.50]To a good cause.
[80:10.30]If you have any Twitch Prime subs you guys haven't used, you're like, yeah, I'm really holding on.

[80:15.95]Yeah, Jerma streams like, I mean, I was like, ugh.
[80:18.52]I'm like, I have this free sub that doesn't matter where I put it, and I was still like, I don't know if it deserves it.
[80:26.41]But if you use it here, the money will actually go to the charity as well.
[80:29.64]So everything, you're tricking Amazon into paying for charity, so it's pretty awesome stuff that you can do.

[85:23.54]I can't until the game comes out, the whole thing.
[85:25.44]Okay, that's fair.
[85:26.75]Wait, wait.
[85:27.53]All seven chapters, you can't rate any of it?
[85:31.43]Well, that's like watching the first third of a movie and then saying, oh wow, this is the best movie ever.
[85:35.72]Did you watch like, I don't know, one of the movies leading up to the Avengers and you were like, I don't know where this is going.
[85:42.93]Alright, that's fair.
[85:45.05]Okay, I would give it A.
[85:47.89]it's like a I it's it's been two okay it's been two chapters I don't know yet I don't know it's like a high oh and these were it's low actually gave me the low down so these were the free ones right so these like don't even count these are just like the trash garbage ones specifically it's a demo specifically says that
[86:14.11]yeah so you can't rate them because it's a it's a beta that's like raiding the trailer for the Avengers movie idiot okay whoa he just brings the toxicity okay alright how do you play uh garlic phone whatever this is just click the link we sent you on Discord and just name yourself and you're in okay it's the Dark Souls of the dictionary do we have everybody dictionary with guns

[86:47.08]Yeah.
[86:47.52]What?
[86:49.65]You can pick the perfect character.
[86:52.01]Yeah.
[86:52.99]Yep.
[86:54.09]Okay.
[86:55.23]Oh, that's definitely me.
[86:58.62]Because I think I'm still going to be on the main screen.
[87:00.58]Can someone else do donation things?
[87:03.80]I can play and try to do donations at the same time.
[87:07.42]How about that?
[87:07.92]I mean, if you're that talented.
[87:09.43]I'm not.

[89:25.42]Really?
[89:25.90]Is that you?
[89:26.58]They would probably get snapped up immediately.
[89:28.58]I've never seen that.
[89:29.54]I didn't even know that existed until right now.
[89:33.97]We're sorry.

[89:39.56]I look at my chat.
[89:40.34]What's your favorite message you read today in your chat, Jerma?
[89:43.54]Okay, somebody said they were very happy with the way that I was doing dialog in the game Deltarune.
[89:51.35]They said that was very funny.
[89:53.84]There is no way the one thing you read was someone being positive.
[90:00.88]And anyway, $100 from Anonymous.

[90:30.89]FortaKids says, FortaKids chat, FortaKids, FortaKids.

[90:40.78]Yeah.
[90:41.61]Oh, thanks.
[90:42.01]Oh, Thunder Chunky, 300 bucks.
[90:43.19]Really enjoyed my first tip of the hats.

[90:47.65]Thanks, T-Chunks.
[90:48.27]Oh, my God.
[90:49.72]It's been going for a decade.
[90:51.04]It's been T-Chunks' first tip of the hats like every year.
[90:53.32]He just keeps forgetting and just keeps giving more money.
[90:57.47]Oh, my God.
[90:59.21]People just made that one now.
[91:01.27]Oh, wow.
[91:03.63]Alright, you guys have fun in chat.
[91:05.16]Feel free to donate.
[91:06.32]Yeah, let's start.
[91:07.92]Okay, so quick explanation.
[91:09.40]This is... It's going to ask you to write a sentence first, and then you write the sentence, and then everyone else draws your sentence, and everyone kind of gets to draw the thing as it goes, like telephone of drawings.
[91:21.80]There's no point.
[91:22.26]Do we have any prompts?
[91:23.48]We just write any sentence you want?
[91:24.74]Okay, well, you write the sentence, and then you're given someone else's sentence to draw, and it rotates on and off.
[91:30.91]Okay, I see, I see.
[91:32.25]Um...
[91:32.79]if you have like an easel nearby now would be a good time to grab it yep a tiny easel uh it is timed it gets generous in time but I'm letting you know we're starting now hey Ster I thought this game was played on the phone actually on like an iPhone before like five seconds everyone here is playing on a phone you can play it on a computer it's kind of like jackbox I'm playing on a computer like how you can do that with jackbox yeah okay I see it I feel like
[92:03.83]I'm like flustered.
[92:05.65]I need a sentence quick.
[92:07.01]I did not pre-plan.
[92:13.86]Okay.
[92:21.07]Okay.
[92:23.69]You can edit it in case you go.
[92:24.75]No, I don't like that.
[92:26.04]Yep.
[92:26.30]You got to be very careful though.
[92:28.16]This is very serious.
[92:29.71]And every once in a while, the phone rings.
[92:32.16]Hello?
[92:32.56]Tip of the hat's here.
[92:34.38]How can I help you?
[92:36.91]I guess it got old.
[92:37.95]Oh, it got old?
[92:39.69]It got old.
[92:41.30]I'm focusing.
[92:42.67]Focus time.
[92:43.65]We need some serious time in the chat.
[92:45.46]Whoops, everyone is seeing my drawing talents.
[92:47.74]I'm drawing with a track pad just because I want to even the playing field a little bit on these imaginary points.
[92:54.86]And if anyone looks at my screen, I punched the person the opposite side of me who didn't look is the rule.
[93:02.40]There are multiple tools for you to use if you want a shortcut.
[93:07.23]We've discussed this in detail, and I feel very strongly that using the circle tool, even though I just did it, is wrong because of the natural artistic... the wabi-sabi of it that is left behind from you drawing yourself.
[93:23.24]You can't let robots become artists.
[93:25.33]You ever saw iRobot, Jerma?
[93:27.83]I'm concentrating very hard.
[93:29.77]Okay, there's that scene where the robot's like, I'm not much of an artist, and then he draws something very well because he's like a printer.
[93:36.94]And then Will Smith is like, huh.
[93:40.46]But I agree with the robot because, you know, he didn't have any soul in his art.
[93:45.07]You see where I'm going with this?
[93:48.33]I don't know how to draw.
[93:51.04]I wish I was using the phone so I could use my finger.
[93:57.77]We need some serious time in the chat.
[93:59.83]It's happening.
[94:02.15]I mean, I'm drawing with a trackpad, so I don't want to hear it.
[94:05.48]We're using our phones.
[94:09.30]Oh, no.
[94:12.22]It's on the top right of your screen.
[94:15.79]Oh, no.
[94:19.25]I don't have time.
[94:21.37]You ever make an error so grievous that you just want to get rid of the whole drawing?
[94:25.44]Because that just happened to me with 15 seconds left.
[94:30.55]just like that you're trying don't I didn't know what it was you look up you don't want him to get hit do you oh hold on oh oh I need this this is important I can't believe do you look up when I say this I didn't look I looked I looked at the top of my phone and I just said it says garthicphone.com on my browser
[94:54.25]This game, I learned that there are more tools than just the pencil.
[94:58.61]Yes, as discussed.
[95:00.06]But the wabi-sabi is very important.
[95:02.36]Well, I don't have that, so... Oh, shit.
[95:04.90]Oh, I got yours, sorry.
[95:10.05]You gotta describe what you've seen to try and keep it going like a phone.
[95:13.61]You describe the thing that you are looking at here.
[95:15.86]Yep.
[95:16.66]Best of your ability.
[95:18.48]Uh...
[95:25.77]I guess that's what that is.
[95:34.82]Hello?
[95:37.72]Oh, we have way less time now.
[95:39.56]Yeah, because you just got to write.
[95:40.79]You don't got to draw a whole thing.
[95:41.77]You just move quick.
[95:43.57]You better have got it in.
[95:46.57]What?
[95:47.87]What?
[95:51.24]Oh, no.
[95:53.08]Oh, gee whiz.
[95:55.62]Yeah, we're like one down, and it's already gotten... Illegible.
[96:03.01]Weird.
[96:03.35]I also just noticed this drawing pad is like watermarked.
[96:10.34]Like they're going to sell all of our doodles if we don't make a stand right now.
[96:16.49]Gartic Phone owns this.
[96:21.42]Oh, this drawing is actually so good.
[96:23.40]It...
[96:26.64]I have clicked on the ad at the bottom of the screen twice now.
[96:38.25]I got to start over.
[96:38.93]I have to start over.
[96:40.25]I'm going to make a nice little... How do you clear the screen really fast?
[96:44.80]I think you just go ham with the eraser tool.
[96:48.06]Oh, no.
[96:50.32]If you're on a computer, you can control Z undo.
[96:53.65]I can?
[96:54.51]Yeah.
[96:55.37]Oh, wow.
[96:55.91]Look at that.
[97:01.05]Crackpad.
[97:01.91]Crackpad drawing, not great.
[97:06.70]The focus, the intensity.
[97:16.90]I am scared.
[97:23.00]Oh, I'm running out of time.
[97:24.62]I'm a Pictionary purist, and I believe in not writing actual words, and you're all cheating if you're writing words.
[97:29.69]I'm not writing words!
[97:31.07]So that's why... I'm doing a great job.
[97:33.74]I'm explaining to everyone who's going to be like, what are you doing?
[97:37.56]What is that?
[97:38.91]That's what that is.
[97:40.27]Those are not real words.
[97:42.91]What about numbers?
[97:45.74]Hello?
[97:46.58]Hello?
[97:47.26]Hello?
[97:47.40]Hello?
[97:47.54]Hello?
[97:48.26]Tip of the hats here.
[97:49.18]What can I help you with?
[97:53.97]Oh, no.
[97:54.75]What time to spare?
[97:59.09]Oh, man, that's just not good on the eyes.
[98:01.32]Nope.
[98:06.52]Oh, no.
[98:07.18]I'm watching your eyes.
[98:11.99]You're looking at my phone!
[98:13.35]I'm watching your eyes to see if you're looking up at the thing.
[98:16.34]I was looking up at the chat, looking at the sussies bounce up and down.
[98:20.16]Now I'm looking at my phone again.
[98:23.59]Uh...
[98:30.91]Alright, I got it.
[98:36.49]You ever just feel like you'd nail a description?
[98:39.29]Yep.
[98:39.79]Don't bait him like that.
[98:47.12]Okay.
[98:47.24]Already?
[98:51.39]Yeah, already.
[98:53.01]Aren't you, like, super quick with it?
[98:54.49]Like, you're just, like, so fast.
[98:55.89]You think of things so quick.
[98:57.43]I don't know if I can draw this, like, Twitch-wise.
[99:01.58]I am, but I use all those things.
[99:15.35]What the?
[99:16.01]What?
[99:16.69]How am I supposed to even do this?
[99:20.52]You're not playing the game if you haven't said that once.
[99:25.44]Oh, my thing wasn't coming up.
[99:36.60]You gotta go.
[99:39.44]How many rounds do we do this for?
[99:41.37]Six out of 14, you see at the top.
[99:42.73]And at the very end, we just go through a round.
[99:45.93]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[99:47.79]I'm so sorry.
[99:48.41]I'm very excited.
[99:49.96]I'm saying that.
[99:52.36]Why am I tracing this?
[99:53.52]I'm just tracing what I just did.
[99:56.02]I'm on like, my brain is on autopilot with this one.
[99:59.59]I did a drawing and I traced it with a different color.
[100:02.97]Remember, it's for the kids.
[100:06.70]Hashtag for the squids.
[100:08.03]Hashtag for the squids.
[100:09.21]I don't know how to talk.
[100:20.00]I was watching good TV lately.
[100:22.10]I'm hurting my finger.
[100:24.94]Good food or anything?
[100:26.18]Any good food?
[100:28.11]Yeah, I like food too.
[100:29.89]Food is... I've had some.
[100:34.41]I don't know how this is not filling properly.
[100:36.64]Does anybody know?
[100:38.36]Oh, well, if I look, let me take a look.
[100:39.90]Yeah.
[100:48.40]And we we got we got some extra time here.
[100:52.30]Really bedazzle this one.
[100:55.57]Yes.
[100:55.67]Hello.
[100:55.83]Take the hats.
[100:56.29]You don't know how you owe $500.
[101:00.86]There was a big donation earlier, but this is the most intense.
[101:04.84]This is esports material.
[101:06.43]This is getting very serious.
[101:09.71]Wow.
[101:10.21]Actually, I just looked at your drawing.
[101:12.98]Again.
[101:14.12]I'm ruining the game.
[101:16.14]Oh, no.
[101:16.74]Yeah, this one doesn't turn out well.
[101:18.06]He punches you every time he looks at the screen.
[101:21.31]Please punch the Walgreens employee.
[101:22.77]I signed up for tip of the hats.
[101:23.73]I knew it would happen.
[101:27.18]There's no sentence that can describe this!
[101:57.89]Hello, yes.
[101:59.52]Yes, caller, we have your number.
[102:00.82]I'm sorry, that's the last one.
[102:03.04]I don't know whose thing is ringing.
[102:04.26]Oh, I get it.
[102:04.98]I think it's my thing.
[102:05.90]I don't know when it rings.
[102:06.80]I played three rounds of this.
[102:08.68]What?
[102:10.13]Wait.
[102:11.97]I just want to read this out loud, but I can't.
[102:14.63]We'll find out later.
[102:15.53]You get to the end.
[102:16.37]We're at eight out of 14.
[102:17.33]And all will be revealed.
[102:18.71]And release.
[102:23.90]A happy little bush over here.
[102:25.98]Okay, let's start.
[102:28.81]Definitely want to work on the hat, get the hat done.
[102:31.52]That's the defining feature of the creature we're drawing that Kurt's going to look up at and spoil.
[102:41.23]Definitely the Beyeard.
[102:46.53]I can't look and see who it is.
[102:48.19]Star has to say it.
[102:49.85]Funk, how you doing?
[102:51.49]What's up, Funky?
[102:54.50]I believe I've been told many times.
[102:58.36]It's Funk.
[102:59.51]Hey, Funky, thank you for the $2.50.
[103:01.57]Thank you, Funky.
[103:02.29]We'll go through all the donations after this round is over.
[103:08.88]I'm failing.
[103:11.28]I feel like a failure.
[103:19.30]I don't know how... This is so many nouns.
[103:22.78]I'm doing the wrong thing.
[103:24.91]I thought it said lollipop.
[103:27.47]Dude, spoilers.
[103:28.73]It doesn't say lollipop.
[103:29.85]There's no spoilers.
[103:33.76]There's no spoilers.
[103:39.15]I clicked on the app.
[103:43.01]Where am I?
[103:44.68]I just left the game.
[103:47.31]I've been desperately trying not to accidentally hit the back button.
[103:50.71]Oh, I'm back.
[103:51.16]Okay.
[103:54.26]I feel like that's pretty easy on a computer.
[103:57.22]Yeah.
[103:59.58]No further elaboration.
[104:05.53]Uh-oh.
[104:06.89]We have to clutch this out.
[104:07.93]Everyone, focus.
[104:10.53]Mine was easy.
[104:11.23]Mine was done in 10 seconds.
[104:13.24]Okay, well then you should keep drawing so that it's better.
[104:16.30]Did you give up?
[104:17.95]Did you honestly give up?
[104:19.91]I did exactly what I needed to do.
[104:21.96]Exactly what it was.
[104:22.64]I didn't need to add to the Mona Lisa?
[104:28.36]Why?
[104:28.62]For what?
[104:35.76]I think I got yours, Jerome.
[104:40.73]You did?
[104:41.09]I think.

[104:58.95]So perfect.
[105:05.59]I just love this job so much.
[105:11.84]You know when you don't know an answer on a quiz and you just have to submit something?
[105:15.59]That's this game.
[105:17.27]The thing I just did was a great description of what I just saw, but also a great Donkey Kong Country level name.
[105:26.24]Oh shit, was that a spoiler?
[105:28.55]No, because the sentence really means nothing on its own.
[105:37.83]Like, I see.
[105:38.65]I get it.
[105:39.81]I see what's happening here, yeah.
[105:44.15]This just reminds me of, like, improv day.
[105:49.00]It's like, oh, just throw up some crazy stuff for us.
[105:54.15]Okay, X, and then Y, and then Y, and then Y, and they're spun around.
[106:00.66]well we've already played like two full rounds of this so we've also all like reached the point where like we need to escalate and you've joined in when it's like max escalation and everyone's like no let's not like draw what we saw we're just gonna like do our own thing why and then why and then well I can't say what they are because then it'll give it away
[106:33.61]Oh, mama.
[106:47.59]Yup, this is, sometimes it really do be like that.
[106:51.06]There's some drawings that you're proud of and others you're not.
[106:55.70]This one, in the latter category.
[106:59.99]I dream to one day come across one that I'm proud of or create one you know what I just got I got time so I can keep adding more I I think that mine is gonna go places where it wasn't intended at all that took me too way too long like what this was
[107:27.45]Hey, it's jermaFireman.
[107:29.05]Why are they posting that?
[107:30.95]I don't know.
[107:32.39]Who is this dude?
[107:33.19]I have no idea.
[107:37.42]That's the worst thing I've ever drawn.
[107:38.86]We are rapidly approaching $50,000, by the way.

[108:21.60]I'm just calling him out right now.
[108:23.74]Someone just said, I can't believe it took me this long to do this, and that one was awful.
[108:29.15]We'll see.
[108:33.84]Why?
[108:34.52]Even though it was Gil, you've set a precedent.
[108:38.49]I'm not going to speak to you until you say my name correctly.
[108:43.41]Thank you.
[108:44.67]That's not fair.
[108:45.66]That's mean.
[108:49.46]Don't worry, STAR_ will say Gil correctly.
[108:54.16]Gil.
[108:56.37]God, Gil's my favorite Toth lore member.

[109:32.89]Are you apologizing for something no one can say?
[109:36.20]We're showing this off at the end.
[109:37.89]I mean, you can't see it now.
[109:38.87]He's apologizing right now.
[109:40.31]Like, oh, sorry, guys.
[109:41.17]I didn't mean to.
[109:41.53]You're just being critical.
[109:43.75]You're a critic.
[109:44.29]Stop being so mean.
[109:45.48]Yeah.
[109:47.16]You're all doing great.
[109:48.14]Hello, tip of the hats here.
[109:50.02]There wasn't even the phone at that time, but.
[109:55.23]Hmm.
[109:55.33]Hmm.
[109:56.41]This was a bad prompt.
[109:57.69]I'm sad.
[109:58.28]My other prompts were good, though.
[109:59.70]Too fat to draw this.
[110:03.10]I have a tiny phone screen that's broken.
[110:05.73]And I'm drawing tiny things and it's just not going to work.
[110:09.90]Don't let your memes be dreams.
[110:12.28]Wouldn't dream of it.
[110:14.01]Okay.
[110:16.11]Oh yeah, you said you weren't going to do the joke again, but you did it again.
[110:19.77]The ring ring, hello?
[110:22.30]That one was different because there wasn't actually a ring.
[110:25.78]Hello, Tip of the Hat's here, taking your call.
[110:27.81]Yes, caller.
[110:29.73]Yes, you're live.
[110:31.72]You can hear everybody in the other room just roaring at laughter from that joke that you just made.
[110:36.03]But I know it's on a delay, so it was not that.
[110:39.89]Oh, it's really quiet right now.
[110:41.25]See?
[110:45.15]Told you.
[110:48.18]Dude, everybody in the chat is laughing really hard.
[110:50.56]So funny.
[110:53.38]Anyone rolling?
[111:27.26]Oh, we're almost done, right?
[111:28.64]We got one more round of this?
[111:29.54]One more.
[111:30.92]And then we get to watch the presentation unfold.
[111:35.08]Last one.
[111:37.21]It'll be worth it.
[111:40.35]I know.
[111:41.75]Alright, well, I've been given an impossible task.
[111:50.18]I'm going to do one abstract shape one for a round.
[111:59.56]I'm a big fan of shapes out there.
[112:02.42]Oh, what's your favorite shape?
[112:05.15]One by one.
[112:07.90]Mine, I really like squares.
[112:12.31]Why is it funny?
[112:13.29]It's serious.
[112:14.89]Triangles are pretty cool too.
[112:19.64]I feel like when you're describing a noun in these descriptions, it should not be how you describe it.
[112:27.87]Like, anything but it.
[112:35.46]How do you draw?
[112:36.16]I want to say the thing I have to draw, but that ruins the game.
[112:42.35]I don't know what I'm doing.
[112:45.43]Like, oh, I'm still in circle.
[112:47.27]My life is over.
[112:51.55]I need a cut and paste.
[112:58.50]There's no time.
[112:59.54]I have a little time.
[113:02.98]I can do this.
[113:03.92]I've actually failed.
[113:07.67]Stay focused.
[113:09.95]We're not going to make it to the regionals if we are working like this.
[113:25.92]We need absolute quiet for this.
[113:27.27]Quiet time.
[113:32.06]Thank you.
[113:35.97]I'll do that here.
[113:37.28]Alvin is taking your call.
