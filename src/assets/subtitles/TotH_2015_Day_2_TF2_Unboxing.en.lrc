[ve:61.1.100]

[00:06.61]That's one of my favorite intros.
[00:17.53]Welcome back, guys.
[00:18.71]We're here for the uncrating section, Tip of the Hats 2015, biggest and best yet.
[00:24.18]Before we get right into it, guys, I want to plug a couple things, because in addition to the uncrating, which we're about to get to, we have the auctions still going.
[00:31.21]And the auctions you can look at on our Steam group.
[00:33.63]In the Steam Group discussions, there's still a ton of items up for grabs.
[00:37.29]There's a Star Unusual Pistol, $700 current bid.
[00:41.22]There's a Jerma Rocket Launcher, $500.
[00:44.26]Number One Craft Tipped Lid, which is our beautiful tip of the hat here.
[00:49.99]So that's all through the Steam Group, guys.
[00:52.09]That's $400 for the tipped lid.
[00:54.41]So check that out in the Steam Group discussions.
[00:56.20]There's still a lot of stuff.
[00:58.12]We're not all done after the Uncrating.
[01:00.24]But the Uncrating raffle is open until we're done here, and...
[01:03.57]We're going to take it away.
[01:04.55]Kurt, I believe in you.
[01:06.13]You've been kind of the annual uncrating guy now.
[01:09.15]The last year was a big deal.
[01:11.47]Yeah.
[01:11.85]Yeah.
[01:12.78]You ready?
[01:13.36]We felt pretty hardcore last year, but I'm ready to go right now.
[01:16.18]We got 405 crates we're going to be unopening.
[01:20.02]If we unbox an unusual here, this will be the first unusual I've ever seen unboxed live.
[01:24.83]Wow.
[01:25.17]I've never unboxed an unusual.
[01:25.79]Did you watch the first tip of the hat?
[01:27.15]We got an unusual.
[01:28.47]In the same room as an unboxed unusual.
[01:30.84]Wow.
[01:31.44]This will be my first time experiencing that.
[01:33.52]So here's the first one.
[01:34.42]So we upped the time scale so it doesn't take forever to open these.
[01:38.58]So we're going to be powering through this.
[01:40.89]We might be done quick.
[01:42.83]So they spin like a rocket.
[01:44.05]Look how fast they spin.
[01:44.91]So fast.
[01:46.59]Two king of the jungles already.
[01:47.82]Look at that.
[01:48.86]Woo!
[01:50.96]Alright.
[01:53.50]Okay.
[01:53.76]So far this is looking like me uncreating right now.
[01:58.49]Maybe we should bump down the time scale a little bit.
[02:00.58]Oh, what's that?
[02:01.94]That's pretty good.
[02:02.38]That's a stat track.
[02:03.86]Stat track.
[02:04.64]Stat track night terror.
[02:05.73]It's a scout loadout.
[02:11.36]Field tested.
[02:11.64]Okay.
[02:11.76]Oh, my God.
[02:12.26]They're spinning so fast.
[02:13.56]They're going so fast.
[02:14.06]They're making my head spin off.
[02:16.49]Maybe we're just shaking them up.
[02:19.01]Shaking the crates.
[02:21.71]There's no anticipation.
[02:22.76]That's true.
[02:23.18]We got another Night Terror, but that one's not stat check.
[02:26.62]We should lower the time scale a little bit.
[02:28.81]Let's lower that time scale.
[02:30.33]There we go.
[02:31.35]Don't look.
[02:32.53]I have no idea what to put it to, but there it is.
[02:36.44]There we go.
[02:38.04]Okay, here we go.
[02:40.01]Oh, it's going to be like slower?
[02:41.51]Oh, that's perfect.
[02:42.37]That's pretty good.
[02:43.33]Got a little anticipation.
[02:45.39]Another king of the jungle?
[02:46.48]It says like a random number.
[02:48.14]Five, two.
[02:49.32]Another king of the... How many is that?
[02:51.24]Four so far?
[02:52.32]Are these glitched?
[02:54.75]We're a bunch of glitchers.
[02:57.13]Oh, a night owl.
[02:57.65]I actually like the night owl skin.
[03:01.15]Yeah, I enjoy that skin.
[03:02.41]I like pretty much all the skins.
[03:04.07]King of the Jungle.
[03:04.88]Another King of the Jungle.
[03:05.68]See, this is... Someone's going to win 900 Kings of Jungles.
[03:09.46]Lutget.
[03:10.52]Lutget.
[03:11.20]Where is Jerma?
[03:12.03]Are Jerma still there?
[03:13.19]Are you guys with us still?
[03:17.11]Are you guys enjoying the unboxing so far?
[03:18.61]Sounds like they are.
[03:19.76]We need a Jerma to unbox.
[03:21.42]I saw that video, Jerma, where you unboxed... Yeah, we need to get him remotely hooked into the stream PC.
[03:27.44]Both of you guys are really lucky at unboxing.
[03:30.21]Listen, I'm here for the moral support.
[03:32.15]I'm here to tell you that this host timescale thing is the greatest thing in the world, and I wish I knew about it.
[03:37.13]It is awesome.
[03:38.01]It is incredible.
[03:38.93]I need to remember this.
[03:40.78]Salomancer just dropped down a $100 donation.
[03:43.06]Thanks to Salomancer, by the way, who was here in the overnight.
[03:46.54]Big Sal.
[03:47.24]You're powering through this.
[03:48.70]Yeah, I think we want to bump down the timescale a little bit so we can talk about raffles and whatnot.
[03:53.91]Extend this uncrating a little bit.
[03:56.72]Just a little bit.
[03:58.98]I want to see a third number.
[04:00.64]We got five and two.
[04:02.63]What do you think it's going to be?
[04:03.65]Three, four, one?
[04:05.83]What number do you think is going to show up?
[04:08.57]Five, two, and a bunch of periods.
[04:10.80]That's perfect.
[04:13.42]Here comes two.
[04:15.56]Higher time scale.
[04:17.10]It opens before you click.
[04:20.65]It spends your money for you.
[04:24.11]I hope you guys get something good.
[04:26.25]Me too.
[04:27.01]Yeah, me too.
[04:28.39]So far we have a lot of King of the Jungles.
[04:31.70]But yeah, if you donate $3 or more, you can... If you would like to enter this raffle, you can donate $3 and get an entry into this raffle.
[04:42.21]You will win everything we uncrate, whether it be terribly... There's one.
[04:47.10]Terrible stuff or amazing unusuals.
[04:49.94]That's pretty cool looking.
[04:51.26]Yeah.
[04:52.37]And guys, you might want to donate sooner rather than later.
[04:54.42]You don't want to wait until the very end in case we do a couple of unusuals right at the end.
[04:58.41]You want to get in now.
[04:59.35]I put in my money to this yesterday.
[05:02.01]So when everyone tells me it was rigged and I win, it wasn't.
[05:05.48]I drank the juice, the poop juice, and I'm going to win.
[05:09.35]Poop juice.
[05:10.03]Oh, that's not bad.
[05:10.67]You're going to win what?
[05:12.40]What are you guys favorite skins?
[05:24.94]I like all of the Scatterguns, pretty much.
[05:28.79]There's very few skins I don't like.
[05:30.83]Like that heavy one we kept getting.
[05:32.37]That one is not a nice skin.
[05:33.69]It's not at all.
[05:34.71]No.
[05:35.10]I think it's rigged.
[05:35.90]Oh, that's not bad.
[05:36.50]That's pretty good.
[05:37.24]You just always get more heavy ones.
[05:40.40]Honestly, I did not know that there were Scattergun skins until a few weeks ago.
[05:44.97]Really?
[05:45.37]Yeah.
[05:45.59]You haven't seen that muddy one?
[05:47.77]It's pretty common.
[05:48.97]I saw my first one about a week or two ago.
[05:51.66]The demo has some nice ones as well, actually.
[05:54.30]I like the carpet bomber on the demo.
[05:55.80]Yeah, the demo has some nice skins for sure.
[05:59.21]You know, actually, as far as this goes, the CS:GO stuff wasn't worth very much.
[06:03.73]The pink items in this game are still worth like $30, $40.
[06:06.44]Really?
[06:07.70]Very few pink items exist so far.
[06:09.94]Pink is a nice color, I think.
[06:12.13]I'm a huge fan.
[06:12.99]Baton Process 210C.
[06:16.39]That is a color, right?
[06:17.09]That's pretty good.
[06:19.44]I think Admiral knows what you're talking about.
[06:22.57]The best color in the world?
[06:23.65]At least one person knows.
[06:24.80]It's the best color in the world.
[06:26.74]James.
[06:27.72]They should put an awesome mob in this game.
[06:29.45]I think we have majority of Forged Fires and King... An awesome one?
[06:35.10]An awesome mob.
[06:36.30]Yeah.
[06:37.30]So how many is this so far?
[06:39.59]I don't think so.
[06:40.95]You guys are not getting lucky, by the way.
[06:43.77]Never lucky.
[06:44.41]Oh, yeah?
[06:44.91]We need you to unbox these.
[06:45.85]Is that true?
[06:46.17]Never lucky.
[06:47.25]Guys, we just... Sorry, we had a $300 donation.
[06:50.36]Sorry to interrupt.
[06:51.34]From Rao T., who had a message saying, Also, Jerma star, thanks for being great YouTubers and great streamers.
[06:57.49]You've really been a great comfort to me and my fianc√©e during hard times.
[07:00.23]We got something.
[07:02.09]Purple.
[07:02.83]A purple range.
[07:03.93]That's pretty sweet.
[07:05.77]What grade is it?
[07:07.86]Can we inspect?
[07:08.64]Can we inspect that?
[07:09.62]It's field tested, it looks like.
[07:12.28]Look at that.
[07:13.71]That's pretty sweet looking.
[07:14.93]I'm going to be doing some... It's actually $33.
[07:16.39]$33.
[07:16.53]Thank you, Star.
[07:17.80]$33.
[07:18.46]If you want to get it, you will win that and everything in your box.
[07:24.77]If you put in $3, you can enter multiple times.
[07:28.14]So if that guy put $300 in, he could have 100 entries.
[07:32.10]Yep, there you go.
[07:33.38]Wow, cool.
[07:34.05]Stuart.
[07:34.99]That was the strange one.
[07:36.29]That one's worth $3.
[07:38.11]Oh, that's not bad.
[07:38.85]That's pretty good.
[07:39.65]I'm sorry.
[07:39.87]I'm just here to get everyone's hopes up.
[07:41.30]We're finding some good stuff.
[07:42.80]Stuart.
[07:44.36]You screwed up, Stuart.
[07:45.48]Boop.
[07:46.36]I like that one.
[07:47.12]Yeah, I like the night owl as well.
[07:49.50]Oh, that's not bad.
[07:50.22]That's pretty good.
[07:51.07]We got another one we can share.
[07:52.53]Yeah.
[07:53.37]They're both field tested too.
[07:55.22]Why is it going so fast?
[07:57.06]We got to power through.
[07:57.88]We have 405 crates we are opening.
[08:00.37]How many is this?
[08:01.17]We only have two hours to do it.
[08:03.82]There are 25 or 50 on a page.
[08:06.56]50 on a... 50 boxes per post.
[08:11.09]Hey, after this, I would recommend... Because you guys are going to have all the free time.
[08:16.48]Maybe you can even do the trade-up contracts.
[08:18.74]Yeah.
[08:19.82]I don't know because this is part of the raffle.
[08:22.10]Whoever wins can do that.
[08:23.57]Yeah, they have that choice.
[08:24.59]I guess.
[08:25.17]Yeah, that's...
[08:26.03]Oh, that's not bad.
[08:31.49]I like how we're doing a bunch of all these.
[08:35.74]That's adorable.
[08:37.38]I like me some hats.
[08:40.24]We got some skins now.
[08:41.28]Oh, look at the little cap.
[08:44.81]Bunch of hats now.
[08:46.17]I wear those sneakers.
[08:48.91]They're boots, actually.
[08:50.63]Oh, that's not bad.
[08:51.30]That's pretty good.
[08:53.48]Yeah.
[08:58.97]Oh my god, some more sneakers.
[09:00.35]They just added a bunch of sneakers.
[09:01.81]There's so many boots.
[09:03.45]Strange boots those first ones were.
[09:04.95]Reminds me of Mela's boots.
[09:06.11]Shout out to the Swades.
[09:07.14]Bootget.
[09:10.28]Whoever said that in chat, that's a good one.
[09:12.86]Bootget.
[09:13.50]Bootget.
[09:15.34]I did add a lot of boots.
[09:16.58]Those aren't boots.
[09:17.21]Trousers.
[09:18.33]Trousers.
[09:19.51]Pants.
[09:20.57]From the waist down, you're going to look great.
[09:22.69]Yeah.
[09:23.33]You've got options from the waist down.
[09:25.21]Sneakers.
[09:26.09]Sneakers and boots.
[09:28.15]And a beanie.
[09:30.95]Sounds like I've ever opened an end-of-the-line crate.
[09:33.27]I personally am a fan.
[09:36.27]I opened two of them.
[09:37.76]I got those boots.
[09:38.62]Those boots right there.
[09:39.94]Wait, are the ones up there strange?
[09:42.22]Strange, yeah, the first ones.
[09:43.52]Where are the unusuals?
[09:46.01]They're inside the crates.
[09:46.99]Where are they?
[09:49.91]We're trying to get them out right now.
[09:51.29]They're inside the crates.
[09:52.32]You haven't been listening.
[09:54.48]How do we extract them?
[09:56.19]With the keys.
[09:57.15]I think you guys are getting robbed here.
[09:59.72]Can the boots even be unusual?
[10:01.68]No.
[10:02.76]You actually just got something pretty interesting.
[10:07.07]Yeah, some boots.
[10:08.91]Oh, that's not bad.
[10:09.67]That's pretty good.
[10:13.62]Nice.
[10:16.30]Ding.
[10:16.56]Yeah, I like that one.
[10:20.41]If we can get some unusual sneakers, you'll have a little stuff flying around at your feet.
[10:26.94]If you get burning flames, it'll be like, ow, my feet are on fire.
[10:31.56]You'll run faster.
[10:32.36]Yeah.
[10:32.84]You'll even have a trail of fire.
[10:34.43]Yeah.
[10:34.59]I think that's actually a thing in the game already.
[10:36.33]These can be, like, strange or something, too.
[10:38.25]They have item qualities, too.
[10:39.47]I haven't really opened very many of these.
[10:40.63]Yeah, so these can be strange.
[10:41.66]I'm not really sure what that means.
[10:42.72]Can someone let me know?
[10:44.16]They just count your kills or points.
[10:46.02]I think it is while you're wearing it.
[10:47.26]Yeah, it's a point maximum.
[10:49.45]Oh, what was that?
[10:50.17]Wait, I thought you could craft that, but it also comes in the crate?
[10:53.95]That sucks.
[10:56.84]Wait, can you craft that, or do you have to uncrate that?
[10:59.66]I have one of those.
[11:00.92]Did you make it?
[11:01.99]I'm not really sure, but I do have one of those.
[11:04.55]It's a sign.
[11:06.65]It's not a hat.
[11:07.49]I want a hat.
[11:08.57]Do you wear it on your head?
[11:09.60]Give me a hat.
[11:10.70]Oh, there's a strange one.
[11:11.80]That's for the scout.
[11:12.76]I think it's for every class.
[11:15.02]It just had the scout's face next to it.
[11:17.71]Oh, that's not bad.
[11:18.47]That's pretty good.
[11:19.21]I've never seen that one.
[11:20.47]Oh, that's not bad.
[11:23.44]So many cosmetics in this game.
[11:24.68]That's pretty good.
[11:26.04]So you can't craft it.
[11:28.35]You get a sign.
[11:30.61]What is that?
[11:31.21]Is that just like a... You get a legs?
[11:35.27]You get a legs.
[11:36.34]Unusual legs.
[11:37.56]You get a legs.
[11:38.48]You get a legs.
[11:39.38]I think those are gloves.
[11:40.28]Get a legs.
[11:41.36]That was almost my nickname, actually.
[11:43.12]Get a legs.
[11:44.33]Yeah, was it?
[11:45.07]Before, yeah.
[11:46.77]Before I made it get a whale.
[11:48.77]How did... It's just a little known fact.
[11:51.90]How did you decide on one or the other?
[11:55.13]Flip the coin.
[11:56.69]Gunmetal campaign coin.
[11:58.59]Oh, I see.
[11:59.37]I just turned mine gold.
[12:00.74]Wow.
[12:02.08]Australian.
[12:03.04]It's actually called Australian.
[12:04.52]Oh yeah, that's right.
[12:05.34]Could you learn the lore?
[12:06.20]Gold doesn't exist in this game.
[12:09.93]I put Australian pan in the promo video and two people got really upset.
[12:16.74]How could you?
[12:17.44]And then we put a name tag on the pan and named it Australian.
[12:22.36]We're right.
[12:22.88]They're wrong.
[12:24.24]They should check the lore of Tip of the Hats, huh?
[12:26.31]Duh.
[12:26.77]Check the Tip of the Hats lore.
[12:28.17]Alright, we're moving on to the expensive little thingies.
[12:31.61]Oh my god.
[12:32.09]What's that?
[12:33.70]Lurker's Leathers.
[12:34.70]Oh my gooses.
[12:36.42]I thought it was like skins.
[12:40.76]A backwards cap.
[12:41.97]Rotation Sensation.
[12:43.25]That's an all-class hat.
[12:45.05]All-class hat.
[12:46.21]That's not bad.
[12:46.59]That's pretty good.
[12:48.27]Thank you.
[12:50.86]I like that.
[12:52.87]I like that a lot.
[12:54.45]Flakjack.
[12:55.30]Full metal jacket reference.
[12:56.74]Another one.
[12:57.80]Just put them right over each other.
[12:59.50]Let's get three in a row.
[13:01.32]Do these cosmetics also have... That's pretty cool.
[13:05.53]Do these cosmetics also have wear levels?
[13:07.93]No.
[13:09.13]You can get unusual... Look at that.
[13:11.43]That's a cool hat.
[13:12.46]That's a full metal jacket reference.
[13:18.32]Jerma, what is this uncrate we're about to uncrate?
[13:21.70]What do you think it's going to be?
[13:23.65]What do you think the status is?
[13:25.11]I think it's going to be... Well, I... It's too late.
[13:30.17]Yeah.
[13:30.67]What about the next one?
[13:31.88]The next one's going to be an unusual burning team captain.
[13:35.74]You can't get one in the channel.
[13:38.12]Can we get him out of here?
[13:39.02]Can we get the overlay for that?
[13:39.93]You can't get the burning effect anymore, can you?
[13:41.69]You have to unbox older ones.
[13:43.95]Oh, yeah.
[13:45.39]You really can't even get that anymore at all?
[13:48.34]We need a trading expert in here.
[13:49.92]It would have to be an old one, I guess.
[13:53.17]Like below crate 20 or something.
[13:55.41]I think that purple one is strange, by the way.
[13:57.65]The born to run.
[13:58.59]Yeah.
[14:00.13]Is that strange?
[14:01.29]Yeah.
[14:02.36]I think it says so.
[14:03.42]Strange.
[14:04.40]That's pretty good, isn't it?
[14:06.02]Purple strange?
[14:07.36]Yeah, it's pretty good.
[14:09.00]Not bad.
[14:10.02]Not bad at all.
[14:12.09]White Russian.
[14:12.65]That's pretty good.
[14:13.25]That is very cool.
[14:14.97]Do you know what reference that's from?
[14:17.08]The drink of white Russian?
[14:18.86]That hat.
[14:19.75]Oh, no.
[14:20.15]The hair?
[14:20.91]What is it?
[14:21.55]Dude?
[14:23.22]The dude?
[14:23.78]The dude?
[14:24.58]You don't know who the dude is?
[14:25.56]Yeah, from the Big Lebowski?
[14:27.03]Yeah, that's what it's from.
[14:28.51]I knew that.
[14:29.67]Pretty good.
[14:30.47]I've seen that movie many times.
[14:32.00]It's a good one.
[14:33.60]Coen Brothers Classic.
[14:35.60]So now we are... Steve Buscemi.
[14:37.96]We have unboxed more than 100 crates now, right?
[14:40.59]Yeah, we're at like 104 right now.
[14:42.51]Blackjack.
[14:42.99]104 out of 500 and... 405.
[14:45.41]We have two salvaged crates.
[14:52.40]Not the really good one, though.
[14:53.80]I think it's crate 40 and 50.
[14:57.26]When you put it that way.
[14:58.94]Yeah, they're pretty awful.
[15:00.28]We probably should just throw them out.
[15:02.47]We're going to be deleting some items on the stream in a few minutes, so stay tuned for that.
[15:06.44]If you delete... Oh, my God.
[15:09.00]Now we got the combo.
[15:09.44]Cool.
[15:09.56]There it is.
[15:10.33]I like that.
[15:11.03]See, that makes it.
[15:11.77]That's what makes the console.
[15:12.85]That looks not strange, though.
[15:13.85]The hair on its own... It is strange?
[15:15.51]It's not.
[15:16.70]But it's pink.
[15:17.68]It's pink as heck.
[15:18.28]Does that say level 69?
[15:19.84]Can we start deleting these, please?
[15:21.20]Thanks, guys.
[15:22.04]That's level 69.
[15:22.77]Oh.
[15:23.91]Inspect it.
[15:24.87]Now, what's the significance of that number?
[15:26.83]People love...
[15:29.25]zany numbers.
[15:31.14]That number is real zany.
[15:32.16]That is a peculiar number, yeah.
[15:34.65]Yeah, it is level 69.
[15:36.21]Wow.
[15:36.61]Look at him strut it off.
[15:38.09]Level 69.
[15:38.69]Good.
[15:39.82]There you go.
[15:41.98]Kappa Kipo.
[15:43.85]We had a $100 donation.
[15:45.01]That was from Deluxe.tf.
[15:46.39]Said, love the cause and the community.
[15:47.74]On behalf of Deluxe.tf, who provides servers and support to the TF2 community over the next few months.
[15:53.43]Deluxe.tf.
[15:54.01]Thanks, guys.
[15:55.37]A lot of people are giving 200k hype.
[15:57.43]Yeah.
[15:58.54]Let's hit 200k.
[16:00.46]If you want to help One Step Camp, our charity, hit 200k.
[16:07.24]you can enter this raffle.
[16:08.88]We're gonna be giving away all of these uncrated items.
[16:12.56]If you donate $3 or more.
[16:13.89]$3 per entry.
[16:15.49]We kind of slack off a little bit explaining it, but every cent of these donations goes straight to One Step Camp and directly helps sick kids with cancer go to camp and be themselves and be kids.
[16:25.22]It's a win-win.
[16:26.34]It is a win-win.
[16:27.10]So we're having a lot of fun here, but it's literally all for the kids.
[16:30.18]We don't get a cent out of this.
[16:32.76]So it's a great cause.
[16:34.01]Even if you don't care about support spurs,
[16:36.67]Go ahead and donate anyway if you've got a few bucks.
[16:39.33]It goes a long way.
[16:40.72]Please.
[16:41.10]We've got to push that 200k.
[16:44.36]That's super, super duper awesome if we hit 200k.
[16:47.45]Oh yeah, absolutely.
[16:48.95]Plenty of time left too.
[16:50.43]Let's beat 200k.
[16:51.53]Forget getting to 200k.
[16:52.76]Let's beat it.
[16:53.50]Let's destroy it.
[16:55.10]Let's delete it.
[16:57.14]If we can do it at 201k... 200k and one cent.
[17:00.94]Yeah, I agree.
[17:03.05]If we really got to 201k... We'll close the donations then.
[17:06.45]I think we can do it.
[17:08.17]I believe in the community.
[17:11.14]Yeah, I do too.
[17:11.90]I really do.
[17:13.34]It would really be so, so... If we could do it, it would be... Good.
[17:18.30]Your internet cut off.
[17:19.53]No, he was doing a thing.
[17:22.15]Is that the thing?
[17:24.10]He's gone.
[17:25.55]He's going to get an unusual.
[17:27.09]Good.
[17:28.53]He's getting his loot juice.
[17:29.71]He's going to start opening his own crates with his own luck.
[17:33.44]If anyone else is opening crates right now at the same time, could you stop?
[17:38.00]Yes.
[17:38.78]Please.
[17:40.08]Please stop.
[17:40.64]So what is this?
[17:41.02]We have more than 100 unlocks so far and no unusuals?
[17:44.49]We're at 130 almost.
[17:46.75]Okay.
[17:47.07]127 right now.
[17:49.99]That's some mental math you just rocked.
[17:52.80]Yeah.
[17:53.82]Nice.
[17:54.38]It's intense, so it's really easy.
[17:58.57]We're getting a lot of... I want to get the banana, right?
[18:02.55]Consolation banana?
[18:03.53]Yeah, the banana.
[18:04.37]Consolation banana or consolation... That pirate thing.
[18:07.94]Everybody talks about the banana, but I like that pirate mask.
[18:10.96]I haven't seen the pirate mask.
[18:12.64]It's really cool.
[18:13.78]In our unusual raffle, if you want to get on that, someone was generous to donate a strange one.
[18:19.61]Unusual haunted ghost.
[18:21.65]Wow.
[18:22.61]Of that.
[18:23.27]I think it's sweet.
[18:24.09]That probably looks so cool.
[18:26.09]Yeah.
[18:27.25]Like dead pirates.
[18:28.28]Yeah.
[18:29.24]It looks like cardboard, but it's really well done.
[18:31.58]Spooky.
[18:33.30]That does sound spooky.
[18:34.02]Spooks.
[18:36.08]A little spookster.
[18:37.70]Now, with these ones, these are the different... They have the tiers, like the kind of Assassin's Creed and stuff, right?
[18:46.73]And the banana and the pirate hat are rare.
[18:49.40]What does that change?
[18:51.10]It messes with the market.
[18:54.28]That's it.
[18:55.28]It's trying to revive the TF2 market and it's doing a good job.
[18:58.00]We're fixing the market, actually, yeah.
[19:03.41]Spooks.
[19:07.93]Yeah, one day I'll hit puberty, boys and girls.
[19:09.75]Guys, we want to remind you that this uncrating section is actually brought to you by and sponsored by backpack.tf, or dare I say powered by backpack.tf.
[19:19.66]So shoutouts to them for sponsoring this section.
[19:21.61]The Teespring numbers, guys, were up to $5,775.13 on the Teespring campaign, which is still open.
[19:29.71]Shirts!
[19:31.34]Real shirts.
[19:32.24]Not digital.
[19:33.42]We're talking real.
[19:39.14]So how is this getting split up?
[19:41.70]Is this kind of a raffle going on here too?
[19:43.77]One person wins everything.
[19:46.01]And guys, this raffle is still open.
[19:48.35]We'll get your backpack expanders.
[19:50.12]Don't worry.
[19:51.46]Well, I was going to say the trade-up contracts, like if you don't want, you're potentially going to have a bunch of bananas, a bunch of stuff if you do trade-ups.
[20:00.61]Yep.
[20:01.88]Oh, that's a good point.
[20:03.20]It's pretty good.
[20:04.32]Yeah.
[20:05.36]Yeah, it's pretty good.
[20:08.25]You could delete all of them as well.
[20:09.57]You have a lot of options with these.
[20:11.85]You could wear all of them, you could trade them up, you could trade them out.
[20:14.94]You could never use your TF2 account again, leave them there.
[20:21.48]There's so many boxes.
[20:26.15]As I'm watching, it just transitions to the next page and it's just full of boxes.
[20:34.15]When we're done this page, we'll be about halfway done with the crates.
[20:38.92]Yep.
[20:39.02]After this page... What would be your ideal hat out of one of these?
[20:43.90]Yeah, what would be ideal?
[20:47.19]That's a very good question.
[20:48.27]I forgot Star and Jerma were in Mumble.
[20:51.53]So I thought someone was like... We were getting hacked.
[20:53.61]Hacked.
[20:54.29]I thought we were getting hacked.
[20:56.14]There's a serial killer.
[20:57.28]I completely forgot they were in Mumble.
[20:58.92]Serial killer got in the Mumble.
[21:01.02]Alright, what do we do in this situation?
[21:04.31]Is someone outside with a walkie-talkie on the roof of the building?
[21:10.36]Who was that?
[21:12.61]Why would that guy... If somebody got into the mumble... Ask a nice question.
[21:17.56]Hey, I'm just curious.
[21:18.30]What would be your ideal hat out of one of these?
[21:21.03]That's what you have to ask.
[21:23.05]That's your question.
[21:25.11]There's so many other things you could say besides that if you broke into the mumble.
[21:36.25]Kurt has almost lost his mind.
[21:38.13]I'm sure you guys reacted too.
[21:41.38]He was using the voice changer the whole time.
[21:44.94]What?
[21:45.44]He was using the voice changer a lot.
[21:46.79]It just wasn't so deep, wasn't so dramatic until then.
[21:49.64]Yeah.
[21:49.86]No, I didn't notice.
[21:50.96]Yeah.
[21:52.91]Tone deaf.
[21:53.60]And it was also just like, Jerma was talking like right when that happened.
[21:58.99]I've been doing that.
[22:00.47]This last one was Star, but I've been doing that this entire time.
[22:04.66]And I was waiting for somebody just to say something and be like, what is he doing?
[22:08.68]We haven't been talking, it's been sound clips.
[22:11.05]We've just been clicking play.
[22:12.39]We've just been using sound clips.
[22:15.15]Even right now, this is a soundboard of Star in Jerma that we're using.
[22:18.86]They're actually not here.
[22:20.08]They had nothing to do with this.
[22:21.28]Before, when we were in the thing, we were just in the mumble beforehand, I'm just like, I was going to do it one time.
[22:28.95]I was going to just do it once, and I was going to assume somebody would be like, what the hell was that?
[22:32.65]No, I did it like 17 times.
[22:35.12]I was noticing someone's voice just kept getting deeper and deeper, and it always sounded like admirable, but I was like, he's not talking.
[22:41.72]I'm looking at him right now.
[22:43.34]I had to go so low to have somebody scared that we'd be like, we've been breached.
[22:48.85]Spooky.
[22:50.97]Pretty good.
[22:51.81]There it is.
[22:53.22]Pretty good.
[22:54.52]Pretty good.
[22:55.02]We had a $150 donation, actually, guys.
[22:57.26]That came from somebody by the name of Jewlander, who says, no doubt about it, you guys are doing something amazing, and I'm happy to donate for the kids.
[23:04.57]Pretty good.
[23:05.35]But let Jerma know, I've always loved his contagious silliness.
[23:11.44]Show those crates no mercy.
[23:13.61]Keep the hype train going for that $200,000 hype.
[23:16.59]So that was Jewlander with a $150 donation.
[23:19.47]That's too bad.
[23:22.09]Pretty good.
[23:22.47]It's not bad.
[23:22.83]Thanks, Jewlander.
[23:23.47]And that goes straight to one-step camp, of course.
[23:29.00]Look how he just powered through that.
[23:30.40]That's exciting.
[23:31.18]Yeah.
[23:35.63]He's doing it backwards now.
[23:37.27]That's too bad.
[23:38.27]That's too bad.
[23:40.23]Pretty good.
[23:45.36]There's probably already 100 people with this as their hit sound.
[23:49.58]I can hear it now.
[23:51.20]Pretty good.
[23:57.87]Good.
[23:59.19]Good.
[24:00.35]Good.
[24:00.91]Good.
[24:01.67]Good.
[24:02.25]Good.
[24:03.39]Good.
[24:04.24]Good.
[24:10.05]Enough.
[24:10.51]Enough.
[24:10.79]It's over.
[24:11.37]Stop it.
[24:12.37]That's not bad.
[24:13.05]It's pretty good.
[24:14.27]It's too many.
[24:15.31]It's too many.
[24:16.70]We did pretty good overload.
[24:18.30]We're sweating.
[24:19.10]You're making us sweat.
[24:25.21]Really?
[24:25.37]No, no, no.
[24:26.95]Okay.
[24:27.07]Kurt didn't want to put his headset back on.
[24:28.81]It was too much.
[24:32.28]My funny bone.
[24:33.72]Welcome to tip of the hat.
[24:34.54]So we're plowing through here, guys.
[24:35.76]We're trucking along here.
[24:37.40]Truck, truck, truck.
[24:39.38]Oh, man, that was pretty good.
[24:43.09]That's probably a bad omen, huh?
[24:45.94]Do you guys hear that?
[24:46.94]Let's do it one more time.
[24:50.90]There we go.
[24:51.99]Directed at a dispenser.
[24:53.19]That's a classic quote.
[24:54.37]How many do you think you have opened so far?
[24:56.55]Each page is 50.
[24:58.00]How many pages have you done?
[24:59.70]We're at the end of four.
[25:01.14]So that means we're coming up on 200.
[25:03.38]We're coming up on halfway.
[25:04.93]If I don't miss my guess.
[25:06.49]So how unlucky does that make you?
[25:08.71]Well, you have a 1% chance of getting it, roughly.
[25:11.49]I think it's below 1 now.
[25:12.68]They probably nerfed it.
[25:14.72]They nerfed it.
[25:15.48]The crate nerf was something.
[25:17.31]Have you got a potassium head or anything?
[25:19.64]No.
[25:20.32]And we're running on the last of these ones.
[25:23.74]We also haven't even gotten a... We didn't even get that same tier in the gunmetal cases either.
[25:32.59]Well, we are doing the powerhouse ones, so... Hopefully we can get a... So fingers crossed for the next set of powerhouse.
[25:38.31]Yeah, I think TF2's a broken game.
[25:40.42]Wow.
[25:41.28]Near for nothing.
[25:42.34]Just throw it right under the bus there.
[25:44.10]Yeah.
[25:45.00]I think these are the last two gunmetal cosmetic cases.
[25:49.81]We had a $3 donation from Pretty Good, who says, Pretty Good, Pretty Good, and he wrote it about, it looks like 50 times.
[25:58.72]That is topical.
[25:59.94]That is very topical.
[26:01.58]Because...
[26:02.96]You want to know why?
[26:04.08]Why is that?
[26:05.04]Because someone was saying pretty good a lot on stream.
[26:07.71]Just recently.
[26:08.17]Pretty good.
[26:08.63]Yeah.
[26:09.31]There you go.
[26:10.25]I remember that.
[26:11.25]I had my moment, and now I'm immune.
[26:13.51]I don't think Tag's been through it yet.
[26:15.10]I don't think he had his moment.
[26:17.38]I don't think he understands.
[26:18.74]He just doesn't get us.
[26:20.22]You'll understand when you're older, sweetheart.
[26:22.11]Yeah.
[26:22.41]I just don't understand what's pretty good about this.
[26:25.15]That is good.
[26:26.55]Honestly.
[26:26.81]I just don't understand this.
[26:27.65]I think I agree.
[26:28.78]We had, by the way, our good friend TMA donated $100 and says, pretty good unboxing.
[26:34.26]TMA, of course.
[26:35.02]What does that stand for?
[26:35.75]What does TMA stand for?
[26:36.61]I think it was too much.
[26:38.41]Painil.
[26:39.41]With a P. I think it was that.
[26:43.24]That's pretty good.
[26:43.72]I think it was Painil.
[26:47.20]That's so much worse.
[26:47.64]What, P?
[26:48.44]Kurt said it first, so, you know.
[26:52.57]That's pretty good.
[26:56.92]It just cut off.
[26:59.90]It just broke his sound card.
[27:02.73]There's smoke coming out of the tower.
[27:05.55]That is exciting.
[27:07.19]Alright, now we're moving on to these powerhouse collection cases.
[27:10.78]What's wrong?
[27:11.38]We got our first aquamarine.
[27:13.64]Dude, I'm going to actually cry on stream.
[27:16.64]That's pretty good.
[27:24.57]That's not bad.
[27:30.24]It's pretty good.
[27:35.65]Pretty good.
[27:35.99]Pretty good.
[27:37.07]Pretty good.
[27:37.33]It has to be the best TF2 stream of all time.
[27:39.43]Hey, that last one?
[27:41.34]Oh, God.
[27:43.30]This has gone pretty good so far.
[27:45.46]Pretty good.
[27:46.79]You got a Spark of Life.
[27:48.55]The Spark of Life Medi Gun from the panel house in the election.
[27:52.54]It's pretty good.
[27:54.02]It's not bad.
[27:55.50]Pretty good.
[27:57.39]Holy moly.
[27:58.31]A brick house.
[27:59.13]Now, there's a song about a brick house.
[28:01.79]She is a brick house.
[28:03.81]A brick.
[28:04.57]Well, it's like, honestly, there's like hundreds of cases to open.
[28:10.72]Yeah.
[28:10.84]We just started.
[28:13.30]We just passed the halfway mark.
[28:17.61]I got to be honest, I do really like... I think the Ocarina is my favorite Rock-A-Launcher skin.
[28:22.43]Really?
[28:22.67]Out of all of them?
[28:23.33]I like the Shock-Jocker or the Shell-Shocker.
[28:26.24]That's the Shell-Shocker?
[28:27.42]Shock-Jock.
[28:28.42]Shock-Jock.
[28:29.20]Shock-Jocker?
[28:29.88]And that's the one with the green, like, little green lightning?
[28:33.25]Yeah.
[28:33.61]Yeah, it looks like radioactive.
[28:34.59]Green lightning.
[28:36.37]Actually, you know, all jokes aside, that item is pretty good.
[28:39.79]Yeah.
[28:40.33]Yeah.
[28:41.14]I think...
[28:41.96]What do you guys like as the unusual effects?
[28:45.04]I think I like the red... What's it called?
[28:47.14]The hot rod or something?
[28:48.85]For the cases?
[28:51.13]Oh, there's like cold... Yeah, there's like a... Hot and like... And there's like a spinning orb of spinning energy.
[28:58.34]I think... I like them all.
[29:00.17]I think I like the... I like them all.
[29:02.45]I like the hot effect.
[29:03.53]They're all lovely in their own way.
[29:06.00]Got a dead reckoner?
[29:06.84]That's pretty nice.
[29:08.26]That is pretty good, yeah.
[29:09.69]Of course, guys, remember, one person is going to win all of these pretty good items.
[29:14.63]The winner of the raffle is going to receive all of these.
[29:17.02]Three dollars gets you one entry into the raffle, and every three bucks gets you an entry.
[29:21.20]It's still open right now, only for the next little while.
[29:23.71]When we're done opening these pretty good crates here, it's going to be finished, and everyone's going to, it'll be closed.
[29:29.26]Get your donation in now and set that you want these.
[29:34.29]Now I'm just thinking of... Disappointment?
[29:37.50]Of Aslan when he says, you're pretty good.
[29:41.58]I'm focused on getting an unusual right now.
[29:44.09]Who we got when we just didn't notice?
[29:45.49]We might have...
[29:46.66]We absolutely might have gotten one.
[29:48.62]I'm pretty sure we would have noticed a pretty good unusual.
[29:50.58]I think we've gotten three now, but we were just laughing too much.
[29:53.91]Oh, by the way, keep plugging this because we want to raise money for One Step Camp.
[29:58.67]If you would like to have a chance at winning all this, you can donate $3 to enter the raffle.
[30:04.02]You can enter as many times as you like.
[30:06.30]So if you have $3,000 and you want 1,000 entries, go for it.
[30:09.77]It would be a pretty good time.
[30:11.79]Go to Vegas.
[30:13.35]Pretty good.
[30:16.46]Guys, the auctions are still open as well, as we mentioned.
[30:19.28]You go to our Steam group for that.
[30:20.46]There's some items.
[30:21.54]Star signed a pistol, I believe.
[30:24.41]Jerma had a weapon, I think a rocket launcher maybe?
[30:27.99]Yeah, it's a strange factory new shell shocker.
[30:30.81]Yeah, so those are always a big hit every year, guys.
[30:33.08]We haven't touched on them too much, but those are there, and it's through our Steam group discussions.
[30:37.10]I'm sure someone will post it in chat, one of the mods.
[30:39.95]They're up for grabs.
[30:41.25]I'm sure we'll get one unusual as well.
[30:42.83]Get some items.
[30:44.07]That way you're guaranteed a good item.
[30:45.95]There's no RNG in that.
[30:49.19]Now that, I think, is my favorite pistol skin.
[30:51.62]Black Dahlia.
[30:52.08]That is a really nice... Yeah, let's have a look.
[30:53.99]That is my favorite pistol skin.
[30:55.25]That's pretty cool.
[30:56.25]Yeah.
[30:57.25]It's pretty good.
[30:58.24]I was waiting for the pretty good.
[30:59.96]I mean, I was honestly waiting for it.
[31:01.46]I gotta say something else.
[31:03.02]You can't say anymore that this is pretty good, even if it is pretty good.
[31:06.43]We're all being brainwashed.
[31:07.79]How many people are watching?
[31:08.79]Everybody's just getting brainwashed.
[31:11.11]It's okay.
[31:12.61]It's all good.
[31:13.71]TF2.
[31:15.12]Charity.
[31:15.36]Pretty good.
[31:16.56]That's not bad.
[31:17.16]Pretty good.
[31:20.28]Star's just downloading, like, plugins.
[31:22.57]Star went to the bathroom, it sounds like.
[31:25.04]That star, you moved your desk out of your room and that was it.
[31:27.88]Into the cathedral.
[31:31.83]Pretty good.
[31:33.73]Flash fryer.
[31:36.05]That's a tongue twister.
[31:37.66]Flash fryer.
[31:39.20]Try to say that ten times fast.
[31:41.26]No.
[31:42.36]I bet you the chat could.
[31:45.83]What's that?
[31:46.87]Oh my god, stop.
[31:50.25]Do you want to see how slow he can talk?
[31:53.81]That's really slow.
[31:55.61]I don't know how he's doing it either.
[31:58.42]Star, I think, is probably definitely the slowest talker.
[32:01.30]I do think we do need the chat's energy.
[32:05.15]I really think we do.
[32:06.53]Give us your energy.
[32:07.45]It really helped with the surf event and it's going to help with the unboxing event.
[32:11.17]What emote can we ask for in the Twitch chat?
[32:15.37]What emote do we want?
[32:16.76]Everybody subscribe and put the hearts in there.
[32:20.88]Or the money.
[32:22.45]Actually, isn't there an unboxing emote?
[32:24.11]Unbox, yeah.
[32:24.55]Is there an unboxing one?
[32:25.13]There's an unboxing emote.
[32:25.85]Do that one.
[32:26.43]Just everybody subscribe.
[32:27.61]Everyone put your money in the box.
[32:28.90]I've never seen that one.
[32:29.74]Look at that.
[32:30.20]Is that Factory New?
[32:31.34]Wow.
[32:32.16]That's pretty snazzy.
[32:35.27]That looks like a skin I get from Game Banana.
[32:37.27]I think we're done.
[32:39.21]What?
[32:39.59]Yep, that's what we're waiting for.
[32:40.65]Is it unusual?
[32:42.90]No.
[32:44.52]No, it's not.
[32:45.36]Well, guys, that's a great reason.
[32:46.58]That's just unintelligible at this point.
[32:52.21]It's a great reason to get your donations in, guys.
[32:54.33]Three bucks buys you into this, and there's some pretty good items.
[32:58.56]Pass out.
[32:59.16]I'm sorry.
[33:02.39]Kurt's just taking a timeout.
[33:03.73]Yeah, I need a timeout.
[33:05.15]Star needs a timeout.
[33:06.47]He's triggering me.
[33:08.14]I'm done.
[33:09.92]Okay.
[33:10.07]He says he's done.
[33:11.67]What was the name of the Scattergun?
[33:14.81]Current event.
[33:16.47]Factory new.
[33:18.42]Right out of the factory.
[33:20.24]That is $21.69.
[33:24.88]Make a bit of bread off of this.
[33:26.18]That was worth it.
[33:28.45]$21.00.
[33:30.23]VX171 said being part of this community has made my life great.
[33:35.09]He goes on to say, I remember the small mumble with 30 people who planned the first one.
[33:39.12]Okay, shout out to Lang and Sean Bud Tag, Truck Truck, Sea Bear Sal, the rest of the crew, bringing smiles to children.
[33:45.99]Thank you for making the community a brighter place from the VX.
[33:50.71]Oh, I know who that guy is.
[33:51.65]Thank you.
[33:52.58]Absolutely, 100 bucks.
[33:53.40]100 American dollars.
[33:56.18]Good luck.
[33:56.72]Good luck on whatever entries you put that money towards.
[34:00.94]I do like the robo-unusuals.
[34:03.73]Whoa.
[34:04.31]Whoa, you got two in there.
[34:06.17]Alright.
[34:06.51]A pallet of crates.
[34:08.29]Well done.
[34:09.81]Gotta use that.
[34:11.31]I was certain it was over after.
[34:13.17]Yeah, so we opened up that crate, and there were more crates inside of it.
[34:18.08]Sort of like an inception.
[34:19.76]You got two for one.
[34:23.48]Bonk.
[34:24.04]We were talking about that earlier.
[34:27.09]Hey, Scout.
[34:28.73]Uh-oh.
[34:29.41]Just exit the game.
[34:31.27]Whoa, look at the time scale.
[34:33.23]The logos are spinning.
[34:37.42]Spoiler alert.
[34:38.30]Spoiler.
[34:38.92]Spoiler alert.
[34:40.38]Spoilers.
[34:41.18]That was just a recap, guys, of what we've opened so far.
[34:43.45]We wanted to just... It's more crates.
[34:45.97]We unboxed crates.
[34:47.81]There you go.
[34:48.71]Okay.
[34:49.88]I was actually about to be scared that we only got palleted crates from that unboxing.
[34:57.17]I want the robo-unusual effects, not the robo-hats.
[34:59.77]Come on.
[35:00.61]Mm-hmm.
[35:01.17]Kurt, listen, it's okay.
[35:03.60]It is okay.
[35:05.54]It is okay.
[35:06.60]It's for the kids.
[35:07.70]It's pretty good.
[35:09.47]We're going to get an unusual.
[35:10.57]I can feel it.
[35:11.75]If we got an unusual pallet of crates, that'd be pretty cool.
[35:14.63]Are there unusual pallets of crates?
[35:16.74]What are the statistics?
[35:17.94]It is 1%, I think.
[35:20.94]Can someone do the spreadsheet up real quick?
[35:24.34]So 1 in 100, if you're lucky, I believe should be.
[35:29.13]But, I mean, when you have Tag and Truck Truck...
[35:34.77]It's honestly just probably mean.
[35:37.09]I think it's going to happen, you know?
[35:39.88]Because I've never gotten on Australian.
[35:42.15]I've never gotten on Unusual.
[35:43.27]Yeah, you should.
[35:44.49]Who cares?
[35:45.07]Tag, it's not about you, okay?
[35:46.79]It's about the unboxing.
[35:49.00]It's just my luck that's just dragging the boat down.
[35:52.40]How selfish are you right now?
[35:54.28]Eat a marshmallow or two.
[35:55.85]Even if we don't, what's going on with that banana?
[35:59.31]That banana's been there for like two days.
[36:00.83]Tag, if you don't eat that, I'm going to lose it.
[36:02.74]Just crack it in half and throw it.
[36:04.24]Have fun losing it.
[36:04.90]I hope you don't find it.
[36:05.78]Whoa.
[36:06.10]Whoa.
[36:06.78]Just smell it a little.
[36:10.47]Just smell the banana.
[36:11.45]Jerma suggests just give it a smell.
[36:13.12]Just smell it.
[36:13.98]See if it's fresh.
[36:14.54]If it's fresh, it's still edible.
[36:16.36]Can you describe the smell of a fresh banana to me?
[36:18.37]Can you?
[36:18.75]There's one right on the table.
[36:20.71]Drying car paint.
[36:22.14]Okay, drying car paint.
[36:23.70]Here we go.
[36:23.94]See how it's supposed to smell, yeah.
[36:25.30]Does drying car paint smell different than wet car paint?
[36:28.91]Uh, yeah, a little.
[36:29.43]Bananas don't go bad from... It would be bruised and dry.
[36:32.99]Yes, they do.
[36:33.43]Honestly, it just smells like bananas.
[36:34.83]Bananas overripe and get educated.
[36:37.22]People want you to eat the banana.
[36:38.98]Maybe if you have a taste of the banana.
[36:41.26]Follow the banana lore, guys, please.
[36:43.37]Take a little bit off of it.
[36:44.53]I'm alright.
[36:45.65]Yeah, but you don't want unusual, then.
[36:47.07]No wonder you don't get anything...
[36:49.19]good.
[36:50.51]It's because I didn't eat the banana.
[36:51.79]Didn't eat the banana.
[36:52.76]Didn't even taste it.
[36:53.98]Didn't even give it a try.
[36:55.18]This heavily bruised banana that's been here for more than a day.
[36:58.89]Didn't even.
[37:00.75]What did it smell like?
[37:02.66]Like a banana.
[37:03.04]It smelled pretty good.
[37:06.18]We had a donation from Bren for $20 who says, I am a heron.
[37:11.07]I have a long neck and I pick fish out of the water with my beak.
[37:14.59]If you don't repost this comment on 10 other pages, I will fly into your kitchen tonight and make a mess of your pots and pans.
[37:20.50]And then they posted that another few times in a row.
[37:23.59]Thanks for reading.
[37:27.87]Luckily, I don't have that many pots and pans.
[37:30.18]Oh, no.
[37:31.95]They obviously want some of these beaks or whatever.
[37:34.47]Ooh, look at that.
[37:35.49]Robot beaks.
[37:36.39]I've never seen that before.
[37:37.82]Yeah, I don't know.
[37:39.02]I like the cosmetics cases.
[37:40.46]Like, you get a cosmetic.
[37:41.90]Yeah.
[37:42.16]Even if you don't get something crazy, you get a cosmetic.
[37:44.92]I like it, too.
[37:45.79]They're very visible.
[37:46.55]You get to dress up your TF2 character.
[37:48.83]Makes your character look better.
[37:51.01]Hmm.
[37:51.21]You can cosplay as Bullet Buzz.
[37:53.70]Honestly, I've never seen a lot of these in-game.
[37:55.68]Yeah.
[37:57.04]It's just a beard.
[37:58.09]I'd like to see the statistics like on Tib of the Hats day the most crates are opened out of the whole year of anybody.
[38:05.26]Nobody really opens them except us.
[38:09.38]Another pile of crates.
[38:11.12]Someone's going to be really popular on a pub server.
[38:13.50]Yeah.
[38:15.79]Just get kicked out of the pub.
[38:18.57]If you're on a pub server that kicks... Whoever wins this gets a nice package that lets you get kicked out of a pub.
[38:24.18]You get a bunch of crates.
[38:25.34]Kicked out of a pub free kit.
[38:27.44]Yeah.
[38:27.96]Use your pub kick kit.
[38:30.06]Drops a crate for up to 23 people on a server.
[38:33.79]That's pretty cool, the bandana.
[38:35.89]Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[38:37.41]That's pretty good.
[38:39.57]We're changing it.
[38:44.80]Pallet of crates.
[38:45.74]I think we need some tips and tricks.
[38:48.23]I don't know any.
[38:49.49]Does anybody have any tips?
[38:52.74]Go to Vegas and play the nickel slots.
[38:55.77]Yeah, that would be a really good idea.
[38:58.20]No, Jerma.
[38:59.50]No, I'm telling you.
[39:00.52]If you ever throw dice in the air and try to win something, just do the nickel slot.
[39:04.55]Just throw dice in the air and try to win something.
[39:07.20]You don't have to worry.
[39:08.08]$20 donation from Fender McBender.
[39:11.01]Guys, listen.
[39:11.65]Let me jump in.
[39:12.93]We're way ahead of schedule on the unboxing because of the time scale.
[39:16.18]Do you want to lower the time scale?
[39:17.40]Yeah, do we want to, do we want to, we have a few options.
[39:19.42]We can lower the time scale.
[39:20.49]We should make it dramatic.
[39:21.89]Or we could keep the time scale the same and fill it maybe with some more pubs or fill it with like trade up stuff if we want to do the trade up contracts perhaps.
[39:29.88]We can't do the trade up.
[39:30.94]Increase.
[39:31.46]Because it's part of the roster.
[39:33.20]We don't want to do that.
[39:34.39]The only thought was is that we'd fill time a bit and reduce the back pack space required for the winner.
[39:39.58]Well, the thing is, what if we trade up a bunch of stuff that they want?
[39:42.60]Yeah, that's not a good idea.
[39:43.54]So do we want to slow down the time scale, or do we want to fill up the... Slow down the time scale.
[39:47.63]Okay.
[39:47.93]Make it more dramatic for the ending.
[39:49.53]Yeah, that's a good thought.
[39:50.71]Actually, not too much, because I think people want pubs.
[39:53.10]It looks like people want pubs.
[39:55.38]Looks like people want pubs.
[39:56.56]What do you think, pubbers over here, what do you guys think?
[39:59.97]You got pubs over there.
[40:01.17]And you got pubs right over there.
[40:03.05]All the way over there.
[40:05.17]We can get Star and Jermistow here.
[40:06.82]They can do some more pub stuff, which is good.
[40:08.76]People always like that.
[40:10.36]We can take a trip to the pub.
[40:12.26]Fill up your glasses.
[40:13.57]Who's that?
[40:14.57]Somebody hacked into the mumble.
[40:16.85]Somebody hacked into the mumble.
[40:19.01]Admirable.
[40:19.57]Keep it down.
[40:20.27]Is that admirable?
[40:22.68]That's admirable, being up to his monkey shines again.
[40:25.84]What do you think the value of somebody's hat are?
[40:29.11]That's the question I have.
[40:30.43]Who is this?
[40:32.87]Hello, who's this?
[40:35.26]This reminds me of my stream on Twitch.
[40:38.81]Just a casual plug.
[40:41.41]Who is this speaking?
[40:42.88]That wasn't a plug.
[40:45.72]I'm sorry, what?
[40:46.26]Did that just say the Dough Puncher?
[40:48.23]Yeah, like he's a chef.
[40:50.79]Or a baker.
[40:52.09]A chef baker.
[40:53.72]Cosplay is kind of fun in TF2.
[40:59.17]Yeah.
[41:00.16]I want to make a cosplay video when I get home.
[41:02.20]You can pretend to be a baker.
[41:03.48]What are you going to dress up as?
[41:05.56]There will be no spoilers other than it's going to be a cosplay video.
[41:11.23]Are you going to get your panty?
[41:13.74]Heat it up so it's hot as well for that unusual effect?
[41:17.28]No, I can't.
[41:18.43]No spoilers.
[41:19.69]I like Kurt's YouTube channel.
[41:21.39]Thanks.
[41:22.81]Find it.
[41:24.00]It's on the internet.
[41:25.12]Dare you to find it.
[41:26.30]Go to www.youtube.com.
[41:30.31]It's located there.
[41:31.05]See if you can find it.
[41:32.41]You can find it there.
[41:34.26]It's on the YouTubes.
[41:35.42]So we're coming down to the end of the Strongbox series.
[41:41.82]You also can find Tag's YouTube channel on YouTube.com.
[41:45.18]Yeah, that's interesting.
[41:46.24]It's one of my favorite sites.
[41:47.59]I've never heard of it.
[41:48.69]I'm also on twitch.tv.com.
[41:50.31]That is also one of my favorite sites.
[41:51.85]I dare you to find it.
[41:52.79]Those are some good websites.
[41:55.20]I share them in my emails with all my friends.
[41:58.32]Hey, Susan, did you know about this game, this website called YouTube.com?
[42:02.99]Yeah.
[42:03.47]You should shift around in there.
[42:05.39]You might find something nice.
[42:06.61]Who's Susan?
[42:09.54]Susan's on YouTube.
[42:11.47]Oh, okay.
[42:12.29]That explains it.
[42:13.13]Susan on YouTube.
[42:15.11]Susan from YouTube.
[42:16.45]That's great.
[42:17.09]That's interesting.
[42:17.95]Shout-outs to Susan.
[42:19.31]She didn't donate, but maybe Susan, if you're watching.
[42:21.15]Crate series number two.
[42:22.18]Now, we're doing the old crates.
[42:24.50]So you just get regular weapons.
[42:27.74]Or you get a Burning Flames team captain.
[42:29.72]One of those.
[42:30.10]There we go.
[42:30.64]Those are the options.
[42:32.09]One of the two.
[42:33.03]Do these cost a lot these days?
[42:34.45]Some of them do.
[42:35.85]You can get paints and stuff.
[42:37.11]Yeah, paints they always used to have.
[42:39.19]And you can get, like, Burning Plain Team Captain.
[42:41.35]Yeah.
[42:42.08]It's pretty interesting odds, actually.
[42:43.48]It's 50-50.
[42:43.94]50% chance either you get a Burning Team Captain or you don't.
[42:47.90]Yeah.
[42:48.38]It's 50-50.
[42:48.94]So far, we're defying all odds.
[42:52.52]Seabear's just like, that math doesn't add up.
[42:55.25]I thought it was somewhere around either you do or you don't.
[42:57.85]You can kill people with that item.
[42:59.31]Oh, my God.
[43:00.29]Yeah.
[43:00.97]That sounds violent.
[43:01.67]Like, that's a real weapon you can use in the game.
[43:04.68]Oh, my goodness.
[43:05.30]That does seem... It's good.
[43:09.04]I'm getting really depressed.
[43:11.49]Yeah, me too.
[43:14.63]Me too.
[43:15.73]I'm going to start crying.
[43:16.31]Do we know how many we've opened so far?
[43:18.61]This is the second last page.
[43:20.48]Hey, that's good.
[43:21.60]That was worth it.
[43:22.64]That's like 300.
[43:25.06]That's $300.
[43:26.54]Goodness.
[43:27.50]That's more than $300.
[43:28.69]Come on.
[43:31.35]I mean, seriously, what is Kraven doing right now?
[43:34.17]He's like not giving us what we want.
[43:36.95]We should call him up.
[43:40.45]Pain Train?
[43:41.85]We'll get one unusual.
[43:43.03]That's a two times cap weapon there.
[43:45.01]I think so.
[43:45.73]It would be an unusual taunt.
[43:47.66]Yeah.
[43:48.00]Or dueling.
[43:49.08]Unbox a dueling minigame.
[43:51.38]Duelies.
[43:52.58]Everyone loves those.
[43:53.72]Yeah.
[43:54.88]Whenever you're on a public server, you see people.
[43:57.02]More white paint.
[43:57.83]Look at that.
[43:59.99]Sorry.
[44:00.41]Florida kids.
[44:00.95]What was that?
[44:03.19]It's the tag faces in there.
[44:06.03]White paint.
[44:07.08]We had a $50 donation from Renu, which is French.
[44:10.56]Says, what an awesome event.
[44:11.51]It's great being able to show my jump movie on stream.
[44:13.47]Renu made the jump movie from yesterday.
[44:15.83]Hey, is this your favorite color?
[44:16.84]It's pink.
[44:17.16]Is this your favorite color?
[44:18.28]Like, it has the numbers and stuff?
[44:19.22]216190216.
[44:19.74]Yeah, that's the color code for it.
[44:21.42]The RGB, yeah.
[44:24.63]Make that your crosshair color.
[44:26.73]Put that in your milk.
[44:27.64]Yeah.
[44:28.98]That's good.
[44:29.82]Gunboats.
[44:31.24]I've never seen those.
[44:32.79]Is that a cosmetic?
[44:33.45]It's just so funny just seeing... Is that a cosmetic?
[44:36.07]Gunboats.
[44:36.85]It kind of is.
[44:37.89]The Gunboats.
[44:39.11]That was exciting to see in a crate like three years ago or like four years ago or something.
[44:43.76]A name tag.
[44:44.10]A name tag.
[44:45.12]You get those for free pretty much twice a year.
[44:47.78]I forgot how exciting these old crates are.
[44:53.09]Oh my god.
[44:55.32]This is, like, hilarious.
[44:56.56]I mean, back in the day, you used to have a lot of paint.
[44:58.47]I always had, like, five or six paints on hand from crates.
[45:01.03]Oh, my God.
[45:01.59]Well, I mean, name tags used to be, back when these crates came out, these name tags used to be, like, $5 each.
[45:06.52]Yeah.
[45:07.08]But now they're only $1.
[45:08.84]Really?
[45:09.24]Yeah.
[45:09.72]Yeah.
[45:10.74]Oh, my God.
[45:11.64]Yeah, I remember name tags used to be really expensive.
[45:13.48]Got three of them now.
[45:13.98]There's going to be some hilarious named items.
[45:19.21]Huh?
[45:20.91]Yeah, we can sign stuff.
[45:22.27]Yeah, we're suggesting maybe we can get some signed.
[45:23.91]Oh, we also can name it.
[45:24.49]If we get an unusual, we can name it pretty good.
[45:26.37]Yeah.
[45:27.43]What would be some good names?
[45:28.25]That would be a good name.
[45:28.89]We can name it pretty good three times.
[45:29.70]We could start brainwashing it or brainstorming it now.
[45:33.00]Well, we already figured it out.
[45:34.30]Pretty good.
[45:34.58]It's called pretty good?
[45:35.42]Okay.
[45:35.64]We're going to get three unusuals, three name tags.
[45:37.60]Okay.
[45:38.23]Two shoes, two feet.
[45:39.19]Shout out to Dave AC.
[45:40.13]There's some team spirit.
[45:41.49]Math checks out.
[45:44.55]I am slowly dying on the inside, Kobe.
[45:50.42]Nice.
[45:52.74]Nice, fine.
[45:53.89]We had a $10 donation from Mike Lockman.
[45:56.51]Thanks for that.
[45:57.03]I appreciate it.
[45:57.69]Geel also made a $50 donation who donated $1,000 earlier, but his message wasn't read.
[46:03.38]Geel's message was, Lock your doors tonight, Admirable.
[46:05.98]Vengeance will be swift.
[46:07.43]And so that's from Geel.
[46:08.63]Thanks to Geel.
[46:09.57]Shout-outs.
[46:11.37]I think that has to do with the bots.
[46:13.19]Thanks for making the bots, Admirable.
[46:15.48]You're the best.
[46:16.63]They're good.
[46:17.75]They're pretty good.
[46:18.59]They're real good.
[46:19.35]They're real good.
[46:21.74]That is the worst paint in the game.
[46:23.32]Yeah, isn't that that green color that all the scouts always wear?
[46:26.27]Yeah.
[46:26.47]Lime green and pink.
[46:27.47]Kind of like this.
[46:27.99]Look at this guy.
[46:29.09]You're a scout.
[46:30.56]He's a scout.
[46:30.94]Isn't that lime green?
[46:33.38]Just took such offense to that.
[46:34.93]I also am wearing, I'm in real life and not in a video game where aesthetic is important.
[46:41.24]I don't care what I wear.
[46:42.46]I'm going to wear a bag tomorrow.
[46:43.66]This guy's cool.
[46:44.84]In a game, you need to wear your unusuals and your good looking stuff.
[46:49.07]When I get home, on our way home, I'm buying a trash bag and I'm going to wear it all day tomorrow.
[46:54.21]That's cool, man.
[46:56.68]That's cool.
[46:59.61]So we're continuing along here with our unboxes.
[47:04.08]Stay tuned for later on, actually, guys.
[47:05.92]Kurt is going to put on a bag.
[47:07.84]No, that's for cleanup.
[47:09.99]I'm going to wear a bag.
[47:11.91]I'm going to attach another bag to it, like a dress.
[47:13.99]It'll just be like a bin to throw trash in.
[47:17.22]I'll be spinning around with trash.
[47:20.30]I did that yesterday when I cut my hair.
[47:21.89]I was in here.
[47:22.85]Now we're going to get some taunts.
[47:24.73]Alright, cool.
[47:25.21]Yep.
[47:28.45]Okay.
[47:29.17]That's good.
[47:29.71]Good start.
[47:30.31]That's probably one of the favorites.
[47:31.67]Yep.
[47:35.67]Alright.
[47:36.10]That's good too.
[47:37.56]I like all the taunts, so you're going to get some doubles.
[47:40.70]Maybe.
[47:42.60]That one's terrible.
[47:46.13]I just contradicted myself, but it's pretty awful.
[47:51.17]Oh, you got the conga.
[47:52.11]The conga.
[47:53.39]Yeah, the conga.
[47:54.42]That one's good.
[47:55.10]I can relate to that character when he says, I got a bucket of chicken.
[48:01.10]Because we got chicken like three days in a row here.
[48:03.75]There's a nice chicken place around the corner.
[48:05.33]Honey butter chicken, I believe.
[48:06.50]Yeah, HPC.
[48:07.46]Yep.
[48:09.55]Yeah, that's two.
[48:10.60]I actually do like that.
[48:12.18]And Ryu actually donated an unusual one of those.
[48:15.21]Oh, really?
[48:15.91]Yeah, it has like the flames going around it.
[48:17.65]It looks sweet.
[48:18.29]Nice.
[48:18.75]Shout out to Stan Ryu.
[48:19.29]It's in our unusual raffle.
[48:20.43]If you would like to donate $5 per entry to get in on that, we have over 100 unusuals that have been generously donated.
[48:27.35]Yep.
[48:27.57]Ranging from really, really nice unusuals to...
[48:29.87]Not so great ones, but unusuals are unusuals.
[48:33.40]I don't have one.
[48:34.22]If I had one, I'd wear it.
[48:35.36]You don't have one?
[48:36.30]No.
[48:36.80]Wow.
[48:37.68]That's a surprise.
[48:38.37]I bought two for the unusual raffle, and I gave them away.
[48:41.77]Gave them away.
[48:42.39]That's a good cause.
[48:43.47]Donated them.
[48:44.15]There's one.
[48:45.12]Unusual truck.
[48:46.36]This is the first unusual.
[48:49.78]Oh, my God.
[48:50.02]Oh, my God.
[48:50.79]Woo.
[48:50.89]Yeah.
[48:52.23]What happened?
[48:54.07]Where did the unusual go?
[48:55.16]There it is.
[48:56.28]Equip it.
[48:56.98]Equip it.
[48:57.60]Equip it.
[48:58.22]Right now.
[48:58.94]Go to loadout.
[49:01.40]Snipe that.
[49:02.47]Can we see it?
[49:03.05]Oh, is it at the top?
[49:04.09]Snipe is a good job, mate.
[49:07.25]There it is.
[49:08.54]That's pretty cool.
[49:09.58]He's pointing.
[49:10.30]Look at him.
[49:11.94]Look at it go.
[49:12.66]I think it's broken.
[49:14.46]It's gone.
[49:15.10]Oh, there it is.
[49:15.87]Look at him point.
[49:17.31]You should go to create a server or something and join it.
[49:21.61]We need to get a real nice look at this.
[49:25.32]Now Star, do you have a value on that?
[49:28.46]Unusual font, ICU, what was it?
[49:30.92]It was the ICU, what's the effect?
[49:32.89]Create a server.
[49:34.09]Go to console and type map and then join, type as map.
[49:39.01]Like map and then space.
[49:41.62]CP, Badlands.
[49:44.92]That's a good choice.
[49:49.89]What was the effect?
[49:52.29]The general price, though, does seem to be about $60.
[49:54.75]Very nice.
[49:56.81]$60?
[49:57.71]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[50:00.16]$60.
[50:03.38]I'm going to be right back.
[50:04.36]That's actually not right because it might not be the same unusual effect.
[50:08.24]That's the average.
[50:10.31]Go to backpack.tf who happens to be our sponsor.
[50:12.87]Sponsoring this segment.
[50:14.19]Price check it on backpack.tf.
[50:16.05]Not on the market.
[50:17.71]They're sponsoring the whole stream, but they're also specifically sponsoring this section.
[50:22.54]The unboxing.
[50:26.82]That is sweet.
[50:28.30]Whoa.
[50:30.38]That is so cool.
[50:31.26]It's orbiting fire.
[50:31.90]That's actually really cool.
[50:32.78]That's not $60.
[50:33.79]Oh, my goodness.
[50:35.27]That's way better than I thought.
[50:37.21]I never knew that was an effective scale.
[50:40.46]That is so cool.
[50:43.06]Do it for 10 minutes.
[50:43.60]Do it for 10 minutes.
[50:45.00]10 minutes.
[50:46.28]And then we'll go back to unboxing.
[50:47.85]I'm sweating now.
[50:50.21]That's pretty good.
[50:51.09]That's pretty good.
[50:51.97]Yeah.
[50:52.55]Pretty good.
[50:55.30]That is so cool.
[50:57.01]What's the name of the effect?
[50:58.17]We're trying to get a price check.
[51:01.77]We will get it in a second.
[51:03.37]Where is it?
[51:05.15]Screaming Tiger?
[51:07.01]Screaming Tiger.
[51:08.42]Hidden Dragon.
[51:10.14]No.
[51:12.16]What if someone killed you and then a half second later you just saw a guy pointing at you with flames?
[51:17.60]I would just be happy.
[51:20.21]My game would uninstall.
[51:21.47]I'd be scared.
[51:22.27]I would not be happy.
[51:23.75]I would never play
[51:26.87]I would never play TF2 again.
[51:29.32]It's an intimidating time.
[51:30.56]Now we get a second Unusual.
[51:31.90]It would even be even better.
[51:34.42]Here we go.
[51:35.82]I'm sorry, I'm a noob.
[51:36.78]I don't know how to use Backpack TF very well, but some of the lower... I don't know about Screaming Tiger.
[51:41.11]That effect seems cooler, but the lower end effects were about 60, and some of the higher ones that were there were $130 for that particular time.
[51:48.97]That's got to be a top effect.
[51:50.78]My God.
[51:51.92]Hey, unboxed on stream.
[51:54.14]Unboxed on stream.
[51:55.16]Pretty good.
[51:57.79]man I am I am content yeah so if you'd like to have a chance at winning that yeah pretty good done get your three bucks in get your three bucks in you can do it multiple times get more chances to win that and a bunch of other stuff we still have like 50 more to go more than 50 oh my gooses
[52:27.22]That's great.
[52:27.80]I've never seen an unusual unbox to either tag, so it was kind of a big thing, yeah.
[52:35.47]I'm happy that it wasn't a lame effect.
[52:37.05]I'm happy that it's actually awesome.
[52:40.01]Yeah.
[52:41.43]I don't think there are any lame, unusual ton effects.
[52:44.06]Maybe a tornado?
[52:45.04]Yeah, you're probably right.
[52:45.72]A tornado is kind of odd.
[52:47.52]Yeah.
[52:48.10]Not necessarily desirable.
[52:48.76]I wouldn't call it lame, though.
[52:49.66]I wouldn't call it lame.
[52:50.76]Just kind of mediocre.
[52:52.23]Yeah.
[52:52.67]Middle of the road.
[52:53.57]Yeah.
[52:53.91]Okay.
[52:54.67]Like, pretty good.
[52:55.41]Pretty good.
[52:56.72]What's this tornado doing in the middle of the room?
[52:59.24]Yeah, just standing in this tornado now.
[53:07.27]Man, we did it.
[53:09.31]We're starting to see more donations roll in now, guys, which is great because I think people want in on this.
[53:14.82]Finally, second last page.
[53:16.86]I think we're going to have to do like 10,000 crates next year so we get like four of them.
[53:20.47]The odds will be on our side definitely then.
[53:22.41]I mean, they are on our side right now.
[53:26.53]Oh my gosh.
[53:31.72]Man, people are brutal in the chat.
[53:33.74]We got some item snobs in the chat.
[53:36.85]I like it.
[53:37.63]Well, if you have a negative attitude, you can just get out of here.
[53:39.97]Yeah, we'll call you Nancy.
[53:41.87]We'll thank you for donating.
[53:44.11]Then we'll get you right out of here.
[53:46.10]Yeah, that's a good point.
[53:47.08]We'll ask for you to come back.
[53:48.46]Donate again.
[53:49.06]Nicely.
[53:50.12]Nancy.
[53:52.27]Don't be a Nancy.
[53:53.23]Somebody donated $5 and says, can we get some DJ Ster for the uncrating finale?
[53:57.02]I don't know if DJ Ster is here.
[53:58.22]No, he was not allowed to attend the event.
[54:01.81]His Visa was denied.
[54:02.93]Yeah, we have Star and Jerma here, of course.
[54:04.65]Where's DJ Ster from?
[54:06.97]Venezuela.
[54:08.30]Sideshow just donated $2.
[54:09.42]Yeah, Josh.
[54:11.69]Sideshow made a donation.
[54:12.85]It was $10 and said, that effect is so cool.
[54:15.40]Nearly as cool as you guys.
[54:17.04]Toth heart.
[54:17.78]Toth heart.
[54:18.66]Thank you.
[54:18.88]That's very nice of you.
[54:20.00]What a sweetheart.
[54:21.88]All the way from Yorkshire.
[54:23.17]Shout outs to Yorkshire in the UK.
[54:27.69]What was that?
[54:28.71]I need to get a snack.
[54:29.85]You know what I mean?
[54:31.58]Go grab a snack.
[54:32.56]You want a bucket of chicken?
[54:33.22]I don't know.
[54:34.29]No, no, no, that's not a snack.
[54:36.51]That's like a meal.
[54:37.09]Reese's would be a good snack.
[54:38.13]The moment you get up, we're getting an unusual.
[54:41.72]We don't need you here.
[54:43.42]But what am I going to get for a snack?
[54:44.70]Reese's.
[54:46.44]That's not a snack.
[54:47.31]That's a treat.
[54:48.13]What about a sandwich?
[54:48.77]Yeah, that's a good point.
[54:49.93]Get a biscuit.
[54:50.95]Can I tell you how much I like calling cookies biscuits?
[54:53.57]I did.
[54:54.30]I've told everyone.
[54:56.52]The Europe people, they call a cookie a biscuit.
[54:58.86]You don't feel so fat.
[55:01.49]Yeah.
[55:02.55]I mean, it breaks down in a few different sections.
[55:04.86]There's meal, snack, treat, and then indulgence.
[55:09.74]That's another one.
[55:10.76]What do you eat for indulgence?
[55:12.76]I would say indulgence is you sit down with a Ben and Jerry's pint of ice cream.
[55:15.95]Yeah, ice cream.
[55:16.31]That's what I was thinking, too.
[55:17.47]Chocolate.
[55:17.69]That's not a treat.
[55:18.93]A treat is, oh, like a piece of candy.
[55:20.55]Oh, let me just take this delicious little Snickers bar.
[55:23.43]That's a treat.
[55:25.07]A Milky Way.
[55:26.36]Milky Way is also a treat.
[55:28.10]I could get a biscuit.
[55:29.68]Go.
[55:30.28]Go get a biscuit.
[55:31.33]No, I don't want one.
[55:34.89]I'm thinking more about you.
[55:38.00]All these taunts.
[55:38.76]Imagine how cool the person with all these taunts is going to be.
[55:41.12]We'll have pretty much every taunt.
[55:43.13]Every single taunt in the whole game.
[55:46.01]What taunt am I going to use?
[55:47.05]I don't even know.
[55:47.65]When you press the G key or whatever your taunt key is behind you, you're going to have a plethora of selections.
[55:54.90]They're probably just going to only play Sniper for a few months.
[55:57.20]Yeah.
[55:58.10]Man, I would.
[55:59.98]I am content.
[56:03.07]I'd like to know who wins this because I'll be a little jelly.
[56:05.93]Join their server.
[56:06.93]Yeah.
[56:07.37]I'm taking a look.
[56:08.97]A little jelly.
[56:14.40]I'd say we do the salvage crates last, I think.
[56:19.42]Yeah.
[56:19.96]Which ones are the salvage crates?
[56:21.23]Those two?
[56:21.73]Yeah.
[56:22.05]Okay.
[56:22.99]No, these are like the newer ones.
[56:25.93]Square Dance.
[56:29.28]Alright, we're doing like the modern key, the modern crates.
[56:33.80]They look a little bigger based on the model, yeah.
[56:35.83]Yeah, I had to buy a bigger key for it.
[56:38.37]Phlogistinator, Strangifier.
[56:40.07]Oh man, wow.
[56:40.75]These are some rough crates.
[56:41.94]I didn't know these were that rough.
[56:46.02]Scattergun.
[56:46.72]Oh my gosh!
[56:49.39]Look at an unusual scattergun kit.
[56:52.88]sniper rifle kit so you can make your sniper rifle kill streak when you get your sniper rifle taunt.
[56:58.83]Can you even get unusuals out of these?
[57:00.99]I don't think so.
[57:02.46]There's no way.
[57:04.34]Yeah.
[57:04.46]You have to be able to.
[57:06.34]I think if they don't have hats in here.
[57:12.13]Rocker268 is looking for some hashtag loot get.
[57:19.22]Yeah, can you get professionals out of this?
[57:21.00]You get professional killstreaks out of these.
[57:23.01]Okay.
[57:24.62]That's pretty good.
[57:25.20]Classic Strangifier.
[57:26.53]Maybe Justin Danford might be into that.
[57:27.93]Oh, you can get Unusuals, but you also can get pro Kill Street kits, apparently.
[57:31.25]Oh, yeah.
[57:31.45]Taunting player kills.
[57:32.59]Now, that's kind of ironic because of all the taunts that you're winning as well.
[57:35.46]You could use it on yourself.
[57:37.54]So when you get your Unusual weapon, you can put a professional Kill Street kit on it, so then your eyes become Unusual as well.
[57:43.54]Yeah.
[57:43.92]Yeah, Unusual eyes.
[57:45.97]Unusual.
[57:46.83]Yeah.
[57:47.77]Strange Winger.
[57:48.77]Oh, we got a Strange Winger.
[57:49.89]Cool.
[57:52.23]That's a very well... Oh, a Texas 10 gallon, wow.
[57:58.27]What is the least expensive unusual in the game?
[58:01.63]Probably like a bubble something.
[58:03.69]Nah, probably like a... Masked flies.
[58:06.50]Masked flies, like that spy hat that no one has.
[58:08.84]On the market right now, there is a $22 unusual, the Janissary Keche.
[58:13.70]I don't even know how to say that.
[58:15.49]It's a spy hat.
[58:18.05]Okay.
[58:18.23]$22.
[58:19.25]What's the effect?
[58:20.89]Smoking.
[58:21.31]Smoking, okay.
[58:23.87]Smoking!
[58:24.15]Can you get an unusual for less than $10?
[58:27.98]I mean, if you find the right person, probably.
[58:30.54]You'd be getting a really good deal on it.
[58:33.30]A coop disaster.
[58:35.46]That's pretty inexpensive too.
[58:37.47]That's consistently been a pretty shit to your hat.
[58:40.47]Do you guys think we should unbox some Manco store packages?
[58:43.97]Those are pretty hype.
[58:45.90]I don't use the word hype that much.
[58:47.18]If you think crates are bad, those are even worse.
[58:49.46]Those are pretty good.
[58:50.89]Those are way worse.
[58:52.79]Watch them all just be keys, and then we can unbox more things.
[58:56.07]If we get an unusual out of the Manco bag, I'll just leave now.
[59:00.46]I'll go home.
[59:04.36]Is it only possible to get standard items from the bag?
[59:07.91]You have to pay like 20 bucks or more to get them.
[59:11.87]You get your free shotgun or whatever.
[59:14.63]Is that like something that's a thing?
[59:20.22]it's something that's a thing scenario lang is in one of these boxes alright love that guy alright let's do the store pack yeah let's open up these store packages alright where are we going to get out of these bad boys so guys get your donations in now because we're going to be closing up this raffle no no we're going to be closing up this round you cannot get anything you still got you still got a few minutes get in those donations now three bucks gets you in on this you're going to win everything whoever the winner is back burner nice good at all nice back burner
[59:48.62]Regular items, untradeable for a week.
[59:51.74]I have no idea if you can craft them either.
[59:54.63]The Huntsman, wow.
[60:01.87]These salvage ones are going to be good.
[60:03.55]Yeah, and then we just have those last two ones.
[60:11.96]Whoa, a pack burner, yeah.
[60:13.05]Last one.
[60:14.59]Drum roll.
[60:15.17]Babyface Blaster?
[60:16.88]It's a southern hospitality.
[60:18.41]Alright.
[60:19.25]The last two real ones.
[60:21.05]Alright.
[60:21.65]Salvage crates.
[60:22.99]If we got an unusual, that would be hype as hell.
[60:26.00]Hype as heck.
[60:26.60]They'll both be unusual.
[60:29.78]One of them will be unusual.
[60:30.68]That's actually pretty good.
[60:31.54]That's quite valuable.
[60:32.28]That's one of the better ones you can get out of that one.
[60:36.63]Alright.
[60:36.87]Here we go.
[60:37.15]Alright.
[60:38.31]Here we go.
[60:39.87]Here we go.
[60:41.14]Drum rolls.
[60:41.70]Here we go.
[60:42.66]Strange Huntsman.
[60:43.62]$10.
[60:44.80]Yeah.
[60:44.92]Don't look.
[60:45.16]Don't look.
[60:45.40]Don't look.
[60:49.55]We don't have a key for the crate.
[60:53.86]We're missing the key?
[60:55.04]So thanks for watching, guys.
[60:59.47]Can we trade a key to that account?
[61:01.21]Is Whisker around?
[61:02.43]I think Whisker has the power to do that.
[61:04.35]We're going to get that solved.
[61:05.38]In the meantime, there were a couple donations.
[61:07.70]$23 donation by Squidimatron that said he's going to be donating roughly two feet of hair for the Cancer Society.
[61:16.77]We needed one key.
[61:17.92]We were one key off.
[61:18.64]We were one key off.
[61:19.44]We have a key.
[61:20.14]But we were one key off.
[61:21.88]We'll get it.
[61:22.32]There's no worries.
[61:24.41]Someone put $250 into that account.
[61:27.45]Get that key.
[61:29.29]Get that key.
[61:30.18]We had one donation from somebody claiming to be Sal's mom.
[61:34.28]$100.
[61:35.24]And said, Salomancer's mom is donating in the hopes of preventing Eric, Salomancer, from putting silly hats on puppies.
[61:44.33]Does he do that on a regular occasion?
[61:46.09]That's interesting, yeah.
[61:49.18]Shout-outs to Sal's mom.
[61:51.74]Thank you, Sal's mom.
[61:53.98]Shout-out to Sal for holding it down during the overnight.
[61:56.43]And he wasn't feeling well either.
[61:58.01]I had to bring him Sudafed.
[61:59.19]He was sick.
[61:59.71]Oh, really?
[62:00.77]And he was a trooper, man.
[62:02.22]He didn't say a word.
[62:03.22]He was here the whole night, overnight.
[62:05.26]Do you want to look at the unusual while we get this key?
[62:07.76]They're probably buying the key, actually, on that account.
[62:09.89]I think that's the only option they have.
[62:11.95]Someone got to throw it on their wallet.
[62:15.25]But, guys, we did unbox an unusual.
[62:17.41]It was a sniper, like, point taunt with, like, flames going around it.
[62:21.40]I think it's worth a little under $100.
[62:23.50]It looks really good.
[62:24.60]Yep.
[62:25.10]Amazingly good, actually.
[62:27.85]So, yeah.
[62:31.02]What I was getting at is if you would like to donate and support One Step Camp, the charity we were fundraising for, you can enter the raffle by donating $3 to have a chance at winning everything we just unboxed, including the unusual.
[62:45.11]Yep.
[62:46.39]Every $3 gets you an entry.
[62:49.01]Yeah.
[62:49.73]So if you want to donate a ton of money, get a ton of chances, go for it.
[62:53.50]Help a good cause and give yourself a good chance.
[62:55.44]Rory Nelson donated $8 and says, roll on the floor and poke your belly.
[63:00.59]So thanks for that.
[63:01.31]Appreciate it.
[63:03.08]Probably not going to do it.
[63:04.04]Yeah, we don't have a lot of floor space on this.
[63:05.84]No.
[63:06.76]Unfortunately.
[63:09.45]So guys, there's a lot left on the schedule still.
[63:11.27]We're not winding down by any means.
[63:12.89]This is one of our bigger events.
[63:14.14]We still have Dota Fortress, of course, coming up still.
[63:16.76]The whole schedule is right on the website.
[63:19.37]We're kind of midway through, I guess.
[63:21.65]We've still got a bunch of stuff.
[63:22.88]So is there a recent donation at all from a person called Finny McBender?
[63:27.28]Let's see.
[63:28.21]I'm curious to what he has to say.
[63:30.57]Was that the one from earlier?
[63:31.67]Yeah.
[63:32.81]Yeah, just a second.
[63:33.49]Let me scroll down.
[63:34.43]It might be too far down.
[63:36.16]I mean, while we're here, another thing, we still have these silent auctions going on on the Steam forums.
[63:41.66]The discussion forums for Tip of the Hats, the group, steamcommunity.com.
[63:45.13]If we can get a mod to link that in chat, that'd be awesome.
[63:48.33]Yeah, yep.
[63:48.61]Yeah, I think I could actually do that right now.
[63:50.94]There's a couple of items on there from various different people where it's not a raffle, it's just an auction.
[63:56.24]So you bid however much you're willing to spend on if you want to take away a couple of these cool things.
[64:02.03]Cool things.
[64:02.71]Nice.
[64:03.17]And it's not RNG.
[64:04.11]You don't have to hold for luck.
[64:05.47]You definitely get something cool because you know exactly what you're bidding on.
[64:07.85]Yeah.
[64:08.55]Fender McBender's donation was $20 and said, you're going to love this.
[64:12.50]Tag, eat the banana and the kids get $20 more.
[64:16.02]Do it.
[64:16.76]Eat the banana.
[64:17.44]Just eat it.
[64:17.78]Take a bite.
[64:18.30]I just dug my own grave.
[64:19.26]Take a bite.
[64:20.01]Take a bite.
[64:20.57]That would be good enough.
[64:22.29]I have to log in.
[64:23.73]What?
[64:23.85]I have to log in.
[64:24.35]I have to log in on that account?
[64:25.34]I'll be right back.
[64:25.88]We're doing it for the key.
[64:26.54]Kurt's going to help us out.
[64:27.64]So while you're gone, we're going to get tagged to eat a banana here.
[64:30.16]Why did I even do this?
[64:31.25]Tag, go ahead and pick the banana up and unpeel it.
[64:33.15]I should have known Fender would do this to me.
[64:35.39]Tag.
[64:35.77]I really should have known.
[64:36.53]You're delaying things.
[64:38.42]Just go ahead and eat it.
[64:43.66]You're going to be banned from the stream if you don't.
[64:46.42]Don't get grossed out.
[64:47.95]This banana is like heavily bruised.
[64:52.03]It's not heavily bruised.
[64:53.88]There's a lot of yellow.
[64:55.94]You can just pick the poison parts off.
[64:57.84]It's not hard.
[64:58.54]You're supposed to pinch it up at the top.
[65:01.59]That's how the monkeys open it.
[65:04.13]It's true.
[65:05.49]Look at... it's... I like opening it that way as well.
[65:09.38]Dude, I'm... this is gross.
[65:11.15]So hold it up just so we can get the screenshots for the emote.
[65:13.87]Like, this is... Make sure to just put a whole bunch in your mouth at once.
[65:17.60]Slynn, would you eat this banana?
[65:20.01]Of course.
[65:20.61]There's nothing wrong with it.
[65:22.17]I've eaten way worse bananas.
[65:24.10]I've eaten bananas that are fully covered in bruises.
[65:26.62]That came from South America or somewhere.
[65:28.82]I'm sorry I'm not there.
[65:30.81]I would share that banana with you.
[65:32.15]I would meet you halfway on that banana.
[65:35.17]Star would eat it.
[65:35.87]People need to suck it up.
[65:36.95]Look at this thing, dude.
[65:39.28]Eat it.
[65:41.66]I'm going to listen to Slynn.
[65:43.30]I'm going to listen to Slynn.
[65:44.24]Tag, I can't believe your selfishness.
[65:46.45]Do you want to eat this?
[65:47.63]No, you have to for the $20.
[65:49.31]It's Fender McBender that said you eat it.
[65:52.79]That's a lot of money.
[65:54.21]We should have more people pledge.
[65:57.82]Take a bite for $20 and we should have more people pledge for you to finish it off.
[66:01.96]We have Lang taking a picture of you.
[66:03.78]Yeah, guys, get your donation comments in and we're going to get tagged to eat this damn thing.
[66:07.67]This is going to go on the Twizzlers.
[66:09.01]The Twitters.
[66:09.69]Why can't I just eat a good banana and not just this bruised one?
[66:15.44]We had Tahu put another $20 in saying, I'd like to put $20 towards the potassium raffle, just wrap it in plastic.
[66:22.62]I don't know what that means.
[66:23.36]Can I just get another banana?
[66:24.80]Why do I have to eat this one?
[66:25.93]Put that in your mouth and let's see what it tastes like.
[66:30.23]You can peel off the little skin thing that's hanging off there.
[66:32.61]You can get rid of that if you want.
[66:34.57]Put that in your mouth and let's see what it tastes like.
[66:36.74]This is barbaric, peer-guilting, and shaming.
[66:39.78]You guys are peer-pressuring me to eat this banana.
[66:42.42]Banana lives matter.
[66:43.80]Let's do it.
[66:46.13]Pop it in your mouth there and let's see what happens.
[66:48.83]Swallow it.
[66:49.31]Just take a couple chews and swallow.
[66:51.62]You'll be fine.
[66:53.08]It has vitamins.
[66:55.12]You ate a marshmallow yesterday.
[66:56.64]You know, Overchain has a fresh banana and she just ate it.
[66:59.14]Overchain just entered the studio to shame him into doing it.
[67:01.79]Do it!
[67:02.23]Just eat it.
[67:03.37]You're a grown-up.
[67:04.43]I bet you it's pretty good.
[67:05.74]I don't know.
[67:06.76]I bet you it's pretty good.
[67:07.54]It might be a little slimy.
[67:08.82]I don't know why.
[67:09.18]It probably tastes like banana, though.
[67:14.37]I feel so bad for you right now.
[67:17.09]I don't like bananas.
[67:18.17]They're pretty gross.
[67:18.75]Emily Vasquez from the Tuggernaut Fan Club.
[67:20.35]I don't like bananas either, Kurt.
[67:21.61]Oh, you don't like bananas?
[67:22.55]No.
[67:23.25]Well, just do it.
[67:23.71]It's 20 bucks.
[67:25.26]We'll pump your stomach after.
[67:29.38]Go ahead and just put it in.
[67:32.46]Look at the front of that.
[67:34.08]Turn that towards the camera.
[67:35.31]Just pick that off.
[67:36.27]That looks gross.
[67:37.25]No, show that part.
[67:38.51]Look at this.
[67:39.61]No, no.
[67:40.77]Like, tilt it.
[67:41.93]That's really gross.
[67:43.13]You can pick that part off.
[67:46.82]This isn't rated PG-13 anymore.
[67:48.52]You should probably, like, not eat that, whatever that is.
[67:51.87]Just pick that part off.
[67:52.77]I said it, like, three times.
[67:54.23]Yeah, pick it off.
[67:55.05]Where am I going to put it?
[67:56.11]Just put it in your pocket for later, like Napoleon Dynamite.
[67:59.12]What's wrong with you?
[68:00.62]He puts his tots in his pocket.
[68:02.48]Can someone, like, give me at least... Someone at least bring me some, like, paper towels.
[68:06.14]Give him water to wash it down with.
[68:07.63]Can I get a paper towel?
[68:08.75]Paper towel?
[68:09.23]PS3IA donated $100 saying let's beat 200K, everyone.
[68:14.35]Put it in here.
[68:15.93]I don't know what that says.
[68:16.89]I can't read.
[68:17.53]We're at 187K.
[68:21.52]This is heartbreaking.
[68:22.58]What did PS Triple say?
[68:23.84]We're not opening the last crate, I'm told.
[68:28.46]I'm pretty sure I could buy a key with my own account.
[68:33.17]I can try.
[68:33.67]I'm going to go ahead and try.
[68:35.81]They told me they couldn't, but I'm going to go ahead and try.
[68:37.51]We had confirmation that the donation from Sal's mom was indeed really his mom, so shout-outs to Salomancer's mom, Mrs. Eric.
[68:48.42]We're forcing food into Tag's mouth.
[68:51.94]We're forcing him to eat it, which is rude.
[68:56.77]The Clam donated $7 and said, Tag is not comfortable around bananas.
[69:00.78]That seems obvious.
[69:01.98]Peeblo, $20, saying, eat the damn banana, Tag.
[69:05.28]People really seem to care about this a lot.
[69:07.93]Well, they just went to another screen, so... Oh, we're still live, I mean.
[69:12.31]Well...
[69:13.44]We're just fixing something.
[69:14.50]Alright, there we go.
[69:15.10]I ate it.
[69:15.55]We're done.
[69:16.95]We're done, stream.
[69:18.23]If you guys want to see me beat up Tag, go ahead and... I don't know.
[69:21.96]Something.
[69:25.73]Tag, the only way out of this at this point now is to eat it.
[69:32.04]Why did I do this?
[69:33.22]The only way out of this is to do it.
[69:35.60]You said, show me Fender McBender's comment.
[69:38.73]Tag, tag.
[69:39.49]You just have to do something more dramatic than eating the banana.
[69:42.11]That's the trick.
[69:42.88]You throw it in Ghetto Whale's face, and then no one cares if you eat it anymore.
[69:48.77]Guys, I want to call out a $1,000 donation we got.
[69:51.79]It's from user Ephraim Sheckle.
[69:54.13]Woo!
[69:54.43]That's $3,000 total now for Ekrems Shekel.
[69:58.05]I've been donating throughout the weekend.
[70:00.24]And as part of the donation, he says, get Jerma to say, you rock, bud, to me, okay?
[70:08.23]What was the name again?
[70:09.79]Ekrems Shekel.
[70:12.35]$1,000.
[70:13.63]Ekrems Shekel.
[70:14.97]Hey, Ekrems Shekel, you rock, bud.
[70:17.87]Thanks for that donation.
[70:19.43]Absolutely.
[70:20.01]I don't like... He's trying to outbid me on my own pistol, so I don't... I'm not feeling too hype about that.
[70:26.80]I just heard a little bit of a bad word.
[70:28.10]Five more dollars from Buttnose this time going toward the tag eating the whole banana fund.
[70:32.69]Okay.
[70:33.89]Just a bite.
[70:34.41]Not the whole banana.
[70:35.19]Just a bite.
[70:35.71]Okay.
[70:36.96]Great.
[70:38.28]Thank you.
[70:39.68]He actually needs a chaser.
[70:40.96]Give me the apple juice, please.
[70:43.54]Okay, here we go.
[70:44.68]The arpel juice.
[70:45.78]Great.
[70:46.48]I love this.
[70:46.84]Just chew it up real quick.
[70:47.84]This is amazing.
[70:49.28]This is my life.
[70:50.42]Down the hatch, Mary Poppins.
[70:55.71]This is the first banana Tag has ever eaten.
[71:02.07]Chew it up.
[71:02.63]Don't choke on it.
[71:05.38]Chew it up for safety.
[71:13.14]Ugh.
[71:13.83]Max Box, Kiba Iokami, both donating for Eat the Banana.
[71:18.38]Bandrek, $12 for Banana Hype.
[71:21.40]Frazboy1 for Tag, Do It, $5.
[71:25.19]That's great, he did it.
[71:26.61]How'd you find it, Tag?
[71:28.77]Has a nice natural sweetness to it.
[71:35.46]Well, that's great.
[71:36.42]So for anyone who's been watching for the past 30 minutes as Tag was working up to eating the banana, thank you for joining us.
[71:42.57]Right now, we're in a bit of a downtime.
[71:44.23]We're buying one final key for our last crate.
[71:47.81]That means, as far as I understand, the raffle for the crates and the items is still open.
[71:52.32]And so you still have time to put in $3 or more to get an entry in there.
[71:56.18]You're going to win a ton of items.
[71:57.66]Tag just lickety-split that banana.
[72:03.00]But when we come back, hopefully, he threw it at me.
[72:05.96]When we come back, hopefully, we'll have, or not when we come back, but when Kurt sits back down, hopefully, we'll have that key figured out.
[72:11.87]Who can put this in the garbage for me?
[72:14.93]Thanks.
[72:16.19]Tag, listen.
[72:17.38]I'm really proud of you today.
[72:19.30]Thanks.
[72:20.20]I can't eat bananas on my own.
[72:21.32]They give me a sick belly.
[72:23.78]Yeah.
[72:26.20]Alright.
[72:27.07]I'm going to eat it because Tag did it.
[72:29.03]Thank God I have this juice box with me.
[72:30.47]I am going to get a sick belly, though, a little bit.
[72:33.12]You're going to get a sick belly.
[72:34.47]Yeah.
[72:34.91]I can eat banana bread and things.
[72:36.39]I can eat stuff with bananas in them.
[72:37.75]But when I eat them on their own, I get a sick belly for some reason.
[72:41.03]If there's any doctors that might be able to explain that to me, I'd love to know.
[72:48.38]Yes.
[72:57.35]Yes.
[72:57.45]Yes.
[72:57.55]Yes.
[72:57.65]Yes.
[72:57.79]Drippings is what I kind of like.
[73:14.33]Are you going to eat it or what?
[73:20.55]What's that?
[73:20.81]You're just going to play around with it.
[73:21.87]So guys, Kurt's back.
[73:22.99]Well, I'd like to be a bit of a tease.
[73:24.65]Hey, Kurt.
[73:27.32]So Kurt is back.
[73:27.96]What's the status?
[73:28.64]Do we have a key?
[73:35.59]Do we have a key?
[73:36.50]Not yet.
[73:37.84]I'm good, thank you.
[73:38.38]How was the banana?
[73:39.32]It was great.
[73:39.92]I missed it.
[73:40.86]He definitely ate it.
[73:41.98]He ate the whole thing, actually.
[73:43.07]I'm a big boy.
[73:43.69]We got some LMAOs, so it seemed to be good.
[73:46.97]Yeah.
[73:47.57]And some craygasms.
[73:48.63]We both had some.
[73:50.82]Did you have a banana earlier, Kurt?
[73:53.00]I do not eat bananas.
[73:54.88]Okay.
[73:55.29]I like banana flavored things.
[73:56.67]I like baking and cooking with bananas.
[73:58.05]Me too.
[73:58.21]I said the same thing.
[73:58.89]I just don't like the texture of actual bananas.
[74:01.31]I like the taste, not the texture.
[74:02.66]Did they make you gag?
[74:03.74]Yep.
[74:04.16]I don't know.
[74:05.41]Guys, it's actually even worse because Fender McBender made me eat that banana, but he can't eat bananas himself.
[74:11.23]When he tries to eat a banana, he gags every single time.
[74:13.40]You got hornswoggled then.
[74:15.62]I don't know what that means.
[74:17.47]Hornswoggled.
[74:19.51]I'm getting a suggestion here from the production crew saying, do we want to delete the last crate?
[74:25.40]These are ideas that sound good in theory.
[74:28.10]I think nothing but there's no reason to do it, honestly.
[74:31.89]I think worst case scenario, we can figure out how to buy a key and then the winner gets the key with the crate.
[74:40.26]And they can use their luck.
[74:41.56]So are we going to call that it for this section?
[74:45.06]I don't know.
[74:45.42]We need word on production.
[74:46.57]I think what they're trying to do is have Dashner trying to buy a key off the market so he can trade it to the account.
[74:55.02]Okay.
[74:55.82]And then try that.
[74:59.67]And if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
[75:01.15]For whatever reason, my PC will not let anyone add funds to it currently.
[75:06.36]Okay.
[75:06.54]Okay.
[75:11.17]Okay, so it's just the Steam servers.
[75:14.18]At least we got an unusual.
[75:15.12]I'm pretty happy.
[75:16.64]I think it looks cool.
[75:17.98]Who cares how much it's worth?
[75:19.50]I mean, a lot of people do, apparently.
[75:21.06]I just like the fact that... I think it looks cool.
[75:23.23]It's worth a lot to me.
[75:25.49]Only the snobby snobs care, you know?
[75:27.37]Yeah.
[75:29.01]Yeah.
[75:29.65]It was $405.
[75:30.37]$404, I guess.
[75:32.84]I just like how, you know, Gitterwell just didn't even finish the banana.
[75:35.56]I will.
[75:36.16]I will right now.
[75:36.86]So we're transitioning to pubs?
[75:38.14]Is that what I heard?
[75:39.95]We're going to finish this section with pubs.
[75:42.59]So, Star and Jerm, are you still with us after all that... after that whole ordeal?
[75:47.55]I am here.
[75:48.78]I am here.
[75:49.20]Yeah, I think... I want some, like, genuine Star and Jerm action.
[75:52.58]Yeah.
[75:52.70]We haven't really gotten that yet.
[75:53.40]We haven't really gotten that yet.
[75:54.22]We've been, like, interrupting way too much of that.
[75:56.72]We had a little bit.
[75:57.26]We had a little bit earlier.
[75:58.61]I don't know where the heck he is.
[76:00.71]Hmm.
[76:02.97]I don't know.
[76:03.45]Hey, get a wall?
[76:04.25]Hey.
[76:04.81]Let me see.
[76:05.19]Let me see if I can track him down.
[76:06.35]Hold on a second.
[76:10.30]Alright, come on now.
[76:12.23]You're just trying to get the screenshots.
[76:14.85]You're trying to get the screenshots so they can post them on the internet.
[76:18.58]Trying to get the screenshots.
[76:20.70]Oh, it already happened?
[76:27.31]Your mic's up on your head.
[76:29.73]If you want some bread.
[76:31.49]Are you gonna choke on a banana?
[76:36.14]Get a will if you die on stream.
[76:40.81]Are we going to pub?
[76:41.66]What's going on?
[76:43.14]I think... Sorry, one of our hosts is... Oh, I'm sorry.
[76:47.84]I'm out of the loop.
[76:49.65]I'm like halfway up that loop, and I'm sliding back.
[76:54.15]I'm testing the roller coaster.
[76:58.32]I found him.
[76:59.66]He's coming.
[77:01.08]Hey, Gorbo made a donation.
[77:04.10]There's a donation here.
[77:05.14]It's from... Oh, it's not on the list here yet.
[77:12.93]I teased it.
[77:19.82]Eat the peel.
[77:22.36]Are we live?
[77:25.87]I believe it's live.
[77:27.35]This is what it's like when we're not live.
[77:28.93]That brief five second before I said, are we live?
[77:32.62]That's what it's like.
[77:33.54]I'm waiting for this Gorbo donation to come through so I can read it.
[77:36.71]How you doing, Lang?
[77:37.51]Wait, Gorbo is MVP?
[77:38.98]What does this mean?
[77:40.62]Oh, Gorbo.
[77:41.90]Yeah, Gorbo.
[77:42.76]I know who that is.
[77:43.48]You know Gorbo.
[77:44.43]That's a star Sims video.
[77:48.51]Yeah, Gorbo.
[77:48.95]That's pretty fun.
[77:49.76]I'm sorry, I was muted.
[77:51.00]Thank you for complimenting me while I was muted.
[77:53.44]I would blush.
[77:54.38]It would hurt.
[77:55.19]It would hurt?
[77:56.43]I'd have to see a doctor.
[77:57.77]Does it hurt when you blush?
[77:59.57]Yes.
[78:00.15]What's the problem there?
[78:00.87]I have a condition.
[78:01.71]It's actually with the butt.
[78:04.50]Okay.
[78:05.90]Butt blush.
[78:06.62]Butt stuff, yeah.
[78:08.38]Butt stuff.
[78:09.71]Alright, we're going to do a roomy tag out.
[78:13.45]Why do you... It's only bad if you draw attention to it.
[78:22.47]Oh, my God.
[78:23.25]Alright.
[78:24.69]Now I don't feel okay letting him take my spot.
[78:28.44]Someone put an admirable face and then like an apple emote.
[78:31.79]That was good.
[78:33.43]Good job to whoever did that.
[78:35.11]It made me smile.
[78:37.32]I don't know why I saw Gorbo, but there was no donation.
[78:39.46]I guess there's something going on there.
[78:42.38]Shoutouts to Gorbo.
[78:45.59]For realsies, in case you're out of the loop, just like me, we are transitioning to pubs as soon as we can.
[78:52.98]We're just ironing out a bug or something.
[78:55.94]Something or other.
[78:58.23]There's always a bug somewhere, right?
[78:59.51]I think Seabear's gonna be pubbing.
[79:00.83]We're in the pub.
[79:04.75]Put your headset on.
[79:08.82]Yeah!
[79:10.40]There you go.
[79:11.56]Got this camera there.
[79:19.01]How's it going?
[79:20.41]It's going pretty good.
[79:21.29]Well, that's good.
[79:29.06]Dota Fortress is after this pub, I believe.
[79:32.90]Correct me if I'm wrong.
[79:34.16]Seabear.
[79:35.33]Make it saucy.
[79:36.85]Yeah, that's saucy.
[79:37.89]That's real saucy.
[79:39.09]Oh, I like the little snip-snap that's going through the mic.
[79:41.57]It sounds real professional.
[79:43.36]It's like he's taking the photography.
[79:45.52]So Star and Jerma, are you guys in the pub right now?
[79:48.44]I'm trying to connect.
[79:49.72]Foley noises.
[79:50.34]We're trying to get Star and Jerma in right now.
[79:51.93]We're trying to get their shenanigans going.
[79:54.83]Kurt, maybe we should have you playing in the pub, Kurt.
[79:57.55]Uh...
[79:58.69]with them.
[79:59.25]No.
[79:59.85]No?
[80:00.73]Okay.
[80:00.85]We got Seabear and Slynn.
[80:02.50]Neither of them have been pubbing yet.
[80:04.40]That's true.
[80:04.88]Get them in on that.
[80:06.12]I just want to make sure we get the shenanigans, you know?
[80:08.24]Is the pub broken?
[80:09.00]Do I have to fix it?
[80:10.23]No.
[80:10.55]They're just dancing.
[80:14.29]Okay.
[80:14.41]That's great.
[80:14.71]A shout out to Eren, by the way.
[80:16.52]She unboxed the Unusual and all of that.
[80:18.84]And now she's doing cam for the pubs, I believe.
[80:21.06]Nice.
[80:21.44]And to fix the view metal thing, Eren, just press home.
[80:26.01]Home or end on the keyboard.
[80:27.19]I made a bind for it.
[80:29.27]It pops right out.
[80:30.25]There you go.
[80:31.15]It popped it right out.
[80:32.01]Popped it right out.
[80:33.75]Pop it right out.
[80:36.58]Is it popped?
[80:37.62]It might be.
[80:38.08]Once you pop.
[80:39.74]Hey, it's stream.
[80:40.76]Thank you.
[80:41.42]Hold on, stream.
[80:42.79]I'm going to take a picture of you, stream.
[80:46.85]Okay, I'll put that somewhere later.
[80:49.19]You look good, stream.
[80:50.15]Somewhere later.
[80:51.60]Maybe.
[80:55.66]I'm comfortable.
[80:56.42]Me too.
[80:57.86]Can you put your...
[81:00.27]He rubbed my back.
[81:02.79]Okay.
[81:02.93]Doesn't that look good?
[81:03.85]I think that's how it's supposed to be, right?
[81:06.84]This is... We're like still... There's like this awkward gap between us.
[81:10.22]Kurt, something's come between us.
[81:11.24]I'll get in there.
[81:12.14]We're just going to make this even... I think it looks good on stream.
[81:16.91]Shoutouts to Lang's elbow that went through the wall.
[81:20.55]Shoutouts to my elbow that just went through this concrete.
[81:24.31]You know what we could fit in between here?
[81:26.08]What?
[81:27.00]Justin Danford.
[81:27.86]That was the question.
[81:28.96]Justin Danford, probably.
[81:30.76]We could fit Tiny Sniper.
[81:32.58]Make Justin eat something.
[81:33.79]Bloodsire would fit.
[81:35.05]Yeah, where is he?
[81:35.95]Make him eat like a fatty piece of meat or something.
[81:38.27]He's right there.
[81:38.63]Get it?
[81:39.47]Fatty piece of meat or something?
[81:42.20]Alright, I'm done.
[81:42.74]Is he a chihuahua?
[81:45.40]He's going to have a fatty piece of meat.
[81:46.96]Is that what they eat?
[81:50.61]Sorry, I'm being saucy over here.
[81:53.66]We're shrugger.
[81:56.73]Is that here?
[81:57.15]I gotta be right back.
[81:58.97]I'm gonna take off the top of my toilet and pee into the water on the top of the toilet up your back.
[82:03.30]It's called an upper decker.
[82:06.04]I like how two people immediately just know what that is.
[82:08.99]Like the terminology.
[82:11.09]I've done that before.
[82:12.33]Who hasn't?
[82:13.25]I'm an 80s kid.
[82:15.32]Only 80s kids have done that.
[82:18.04]It's actually technically not a proper upper decker.
[82:21.00]I don't want to explain what it actually is.
[82:23.01]Well, I think you just spelled it out pretty much because now I know.
[82:26.39]I didn't know before.
[82:27.47]Was that you, Bear, that had my back?
[82:29.32]I'm not pooping.
[82:33.48]I was going up the stairs and I heard you guys talking about upper deckers and I was like, wait just a second, that's not what's happening.
[82:39.55]But if you put your mind to it,
[82:41.87]Yeah, you can do anything.
[82:44.32]Yeah, well, I can't I can't really pee out of my poo.
[82:47.62]What are you talking about?
[82:50.08]We should probably promote our upcoming events and charity stuff Dota 4 is after this pub in an hour, I believe.
[83:00.84]Oh, yeah, we still have to do that.
[83:04.27]You can put some money towards some awesome stuff.
[83:07.47]We haven't pimped the quilt enough, in my opinion.
[83:09.64]Yeah, you're right.
[83:10.66]If I was allowed to wear any of the raffles, which I'm not, some staff perks me in the staff, I would put all my money towards this wonderful quilt.
[83:18.98]Very comfortable, very well made.
[83:20.80]It is gorgeous.
[83:21.30]It's probably worth at least $1,000.
[83:23.38]It's handmade, one of a kind.
[83:25.17]It's beautiful.
[83:26.61]Beautiful.
[83:27.03]You're paying for the quality and the time.
[83:28.81]I mean, that's a huge... It's quality, like you said.
[83:33.19]Very much so, the definition of quality.
[83:36.16]Also very unique.
[83:37.98]We broke $190,000 according to our production.
[83:40.56]U.S.
[83:40.96]dollars.
[83:42.00]I think we can get to $200,000, guys.
[83:44.98]Just keep entering those raffles.
[83:47.62]Yeah, we still have the silent auctions, obviously, as we talked about.
[83:50.46]Some of the items that were signed, for example, by Star and Jerma.
[83:53.45]We have the craft number one tipped lid.
[83:55.67]Those are some of the highlights.
[83:56.74]There are some more items as well.
[83:59.92]If you're looking on the lower spectrum of cost or the high...
[84:03.31]You know, you can have what you want.
[84:04.71]What do those items bid up to?
[84:07.70]The Star and Jerm items were up around $500, $600, $700, for example.
[84:12.02]The tip lid was about $400 at last check.
[84:15.51]So we're going to get to a point then if we add those up, we're going to be over $200,000.
[84:19.37]I think we're not going to do that until, you know.
[84:21.12]I think we're going to get to over $200,000.
[84:22.82]We're going to get over.
[84:23.52]We're going to get screened.
[84:24.60]I want to see the two, zero, zero.
[84:28.22]0-0-0.
[84:28.80]I can probably get a good angle of the host chair from here.
[84:32.35]Okay.
[84:32.63]I'm trying to do that.
[84:33.95]Blank, do you do this often in life?
[84:36.15]Or do you just, like, whip that giant camera out?
[84:38.24]If you have an extensive camera... I stole this.
[84:40.76]Whip it out.
[84:41.54]I just found this.
[84:44.03]I unboxed this.
[84:45.39]By the way, have we, like...
[84:48.82]to the Valve raffle at all?
[84:50.61]Like, have we even mentioned it at all?
[84:51.95]That's a great question.
[84:53.11]Like, the Valve merch, like, I know this is, oh, it is stuck to the table.
[84:57.62]I'm pulling off the table.
[84:59.06]This thing is adorable.
[85:01.02]It really is.
[85:01.80]Like, look at it!
[85:04.65]Like, and it has a sad face when you're feeling all sad, but I like the happy side.
[85:09.01]But there's a lot more of the Valve stuff.
[85:10.78]It has, like, some voice lines.
[85:13.93]dispenser going up so cute we talk about some of the other items and you don't just win this you pretty much win everything TF2 related that valve sells what stuff did you like Kurt if you win that raffle there's five winners and two of them also get the chess set which I don't think is sold anymore this is a really cool raffle and it we did it last minute because all this stuff like we got a huge box of yes like the night before to the hats
[85:39.40]Yeah, tremendous shout out to Eric Smith and the rest of the guys at Valve for making that happen.
[85:44.49]Like, we were just like, hey, can we have some stuff to raffle off?
[85:48.70]And they were like, yeah, okay.
[85:49.66]And then they sent us a lot of stuff to raffle off.
[85:54.52]And Austin carried it.
[85:55.72]He carried the heaviest parts.
[85:57.84]He had to do that a lot recently.
[85:59.14]He had to carry a lot of heavy stuff.
[86:00.24]Thank you, Austin.
[86:00.80]I appreciate that.
[86:01.43]Speaking of heavies, one of the items from Valve is like a scarf, but it's like the bandolier that the heavy wears.
[86:07.21]I thought that was a cool item.
[86:08.77]We were looking at some of them yesterday.
[86:15.72]Jeremy, are you back?
[86:17.08]That server is packed.
[86:20.75]Yeah, I'm here.
[86:21.65]The server is very, very, very full.
[86:24.21]Oh.
[86:24.50]Do you have a reserved slot?
[86:26.81]Yeah, I think so.
[86:27.45]Admirable, can you hear me?
[86:30.05]Can you tap Malo on the shoulder and tell him to put his mic next to his mouse?
[86:38.72]Take away your mic.
[86:42.63]There you go.
[86:44.35]It's transmitting.
[86:45.09]Cool.
[86:47.78]We hear your saliva.
[86:49.22]We need Jerma Star in here so they can game it up.
[86:54.37]yeah we gotta we gotta be gamers oh who are the captains for uh Dota fortress star and Jerma really I'm pumped for that man everybody wanted to see that happen I want to see it happen I was wondering who it was and I was hoping I did my research this time oh good I'm ready I'm ready to pick I'm ready to ban and I'm ready to take on stars team whatever it may be got some spreadsheets ready
[87:22.54]I am ready to feel no threat whatsoever.
[87:26.58]Yeah.
[87:27.52]Well, we'll have to see what happens.
[87:30.43]I've been studying.
[87:31.19]I've been watching tape.
[87:32.83]I've been seeing, okay, who's the best scout in the world?
[87:35.19]Okay, who's the best soldier in the world?
[87:36.47]I've been going through hundreds of hours of tape.
[87:39.32]Good luck.
[87:39.88]You can only pick Manny once.
[87:41.08]Oh, you have tape.
[87:43.42]Where'd you get the tapes?
[87:44.46]How do we get some of those tapes?
[87:45.68]You put it on tape just for this.
[87:47.37]Yeah, he had them on VHS.
[87:47.99]I actually saw it.
[87:48.95]I went and visited him.
[87:51.26]Yeah, I got a wall.
[87:52.90]It's just shelves.
[87:54.72]I got a fanny tape.
[87:56.39]It's 65 minutes of his best highlights.
[87:58.37]I've watched it 25 times.
[87:59.83]We could maybe raffle some of those off next year.
[88:04.70]What is on the tag tape?
[88:07.17]Bananas.
[88:07.77]He rocket jumped and got a guy?
[88:11.05]Yeah, no, he did that.
[88:12.23]Sounds like he did that.
[88:13.52]Classic tag.
[88:14.90]Yeah.
[88:17.48]You pulled out the shotgun in one of these clips and went like, and the guy dropped.
[88:22.11]It was, you know, he got three people.
[88:24.98]Wow.
[88:25.78]The triple.
[88:28.02]Yeah.
[88:28.14]Not the double.
[88:28.61]But man, let me tell you what was on that mailer tape.
[88:33.30]Woo!
[88:33.87]Do we know who's going to be on the Dota Fortress lineup as far as players?
[88:38.83]There's a lot of players to list off.
[88:40.70]I want to hear what was on the mail.
[88:41.66]I don't know any of them.
[88:42.94]That's a Sean Bud question.
[88:44.64]I imagine Danny and Noah are in there.
[88:47.93]Yeah, but you guys are just going to have to wait because all the names like last year, everything's going to be up on screen.
[88:53.89]It would feel trivial to list you all these many, many great players when in a moment you'll be able to see them all in glory.
[89:01.87]Yeah, it's at...
[89:03.57]It's in 15 minutes, right?
[89:04.83]Or is it an hour and 15?
[89:06.05]I think it's an hour and 15.
[89:07.03]15 minutes, actually.
[89:08.70]Okay.
[89:09.16]Is it?
[89:09.56]Okay.
[89:10.06]Are you sure?
[89:10.46]15 minutes.
[89:11.26]Oh.
[89:11.62]Yeah.
[89:12.69]You're not a doctor.
[89:13.65]My phone died.
[89:14.13]I don't know what time it is.
[89:15.05]I don't have to be.
[89:16.68]845.
[89:17.02]That's right.
[89:18.44]So, Jerma, what was on the maila tape?
[89:20.20]I'm dying to hear it.
[89:21.63]We interrupted you.
[89:23.53]No, no, just all of his greatest, latest and greatest plays.
[89:27.36]Yeah, he hit several air shots during the 6v6 tournament.
[89:33.34]Yeah, he eliminated like two or three people in Jerma Rumble too.
[89:36.31]That was on there.
[89:37.77]He actually deleted the VHS though.
[89:40.31]Okay.
[89:40.83]For those of you that don't know what it is, just go to YouTubes.com and search Jerma Rumble.
[89:48.22]Very good video.
[89:50.42]Probably my favorite series that Jerma has going on right now.
[89:54.60]Thank you.
[89:55.98]Yeah, it's good stuff Very much appreciate it Very much I feel like you're in like Sunday school.
[90:10.73]Yes, I very much appreciate that.
[90:12.56]Thank you very much Do my research though last year it was like I
[90:21.63]I was just like, alright, first pick, bring on Stabby.
[90:25.32]And everyone was just like, whoa, what have you done?
[90:28.74]Whoa!
[90:29.40]That's a spy.
[90:30.21]Yeah, and I didn't show nearly enough mercy.
[90:33.65]He didn't show any, and he showed no restraint at all.
[90:35.90]He just ran full force.
[90:37.52]Yep.
[90:38.36]I couldn't stop myself.
[90:40.60]Guys, if some people are watching and this is the first time you've seen Tip of the Hats, you can go to our YouTube channel and watch Dota Fortress from last year to see how it all went down.
[90:48.21]We're going to be explaining that right before the event, correct?
[90:51.63]Yep.
[90:51.95]Okay.
[90:52.98]In case you really want to go right now.
[90:55.64]No, not right now.
[90:56.32]Don't go now because we have 15 minutes.
[90:58.24]If you like the one that we're about to do, you can go watch last year's after we're done this year's.
[91:04.21]Last year's had a really good conclusion.
[91:05.85]I don't know if we're going to be able to meet that, but we got a bunch of good people.
[91:11.73]Some good guys.
[91:12.88]Less than 15 minutes, actually.
[91:15.08]We're getting close to 200k.
[91:16.26]200,000.
[91:17.88]Yeah, man.
[91:21.48]I think even if the silent auction's finished, we might be there.
[91:26.55]I want to see it on screen, though.
[91:28.29]If you see it on screen, then it's real.
[91:30.81]Then it's real.
[91:31.71]Yep.
[91:34.62]We had a user name, an anonymous donation, $100, saying, great job, fellas.
[91:39.49]$100.
[91:42.52]Thank you.
[91:43.18]US, yeah.
[91:43.88]Well, great job to you for donating $100.
[91:46.67]Yeah.
[91:50.02]Another anonymous donation, 15, says, I've been watching the stream for hours.
[91:53.51]This is my first time ever with Tip of the Hats.
[91:55.87]I started TF2 not that long ago.
[91:58.19]My family has struggled with cancer, and I do think this is a good cause.
[92:01.78]I hope this continues.
[92:03.08]Keep it up.
[92:03.58]It is going to continue.
[92:04.90]Thank you for tuning in as well.
[92:05.94]Yeah, absolutely.
[92:07.30]Yeah, all the new viewers, thank you all so much for tuning in, giving some of your time to us, enjoying the content that we're making, donating.
[92:14.03]We really appreciate that.
[92:14.79]I really hope you guys have enjoyed what we put on.
[92:16.69]We put a lot of effort into this.
[92:18.12]A lot.
[92:18.52]Before, during.
[92:19.96]and probably after when we're delivering the items.
[92:23.40]When Lang's cleaning up for five hours.
[92:26.97]And cleaning up the set, yeah.
[92:28.53]I won't be able to sleep for a while.
[92:30.97]But yeah, I really hope you guys have enjoyed the show so far.
[92:34.75]We've put a lot of thought into it and time.
[92:38.32]Shout-outs to these two guys in particular who have done a lot of work.
[92:42.98]I mean, it's really all of us.
[92:44.88]There's just so many people.
[92:46.73]It's amazing how much stuff gets done.
[92:48.75]And how many people are involved?
[92:50.31]There's so many people involved in this.
[92:52.13]And, like, we've been planning this event for, like, what, nine months?
[92:57.22]Yeah, pretty much.
[92:58.14]Something like that.
[92:58.80]It's taken such a long time.
[92:59.94]Like, I was... We were having meetings so long ago.
[93:04.31]I was getting on trains and going places and trying to find a place to host this event.
[93:08.09]And, of course, you just wound up at the place that makes the most sense and has been right under my nose the whole time, Ignite.
[93:12.78]I'm so glad.
[93:13.88]I'm so thankful for everything Ignite has done.
[93:15.44]They've just been great.
[93:17.14]I can't wait...
[93:18.25]for the closing section so we can do this again.
[93:21.43]But I think we should hold off to the closing section because it isn't over.
[93:24.63]It's not over.
[93:25.90]We still have Dota Fortress.
[93:28.28]Dota Fortress.
[93:29.40]With Jerma and Star as your captains.
[93:32.32]Who's going to win?
[93:33.65]Who knows?
[93:34.45]Who's going to win?
[93:36.33]I bet on Star.
[93:38.57]How much are you betting?
[93:40.33]I'd like to see you put your money where your mouth is.
[93:43.16]I'm telling you, you're making the wrong choice.
[93:46.48]Who am I betting against?
[93:49.04]My betting is against the world?
[93:51.77]Against either of us, you know, one of us, only one of us can be the gaming president.
[93:56.45]Alright, I bet $100.
[93:58.47]She gets Saloon.tf on Star?
[94:00.09]On Star's game, yeah.
[94:02.36]We could, potentially.
[94:03.84]$100 on Star?
[94:06.34]$100 on Star's game.
[94:08.16]I've got strategies.
[94:09.34]I'm going to donate.
[94:10.51]Was that admirable, making a smart decision with money?
[94:14.37]No.
[94:16.08]No, no.
[94:16.46]Do you want to do the Twitter followers thing again?
[94:19.01]I'd give $1,000 for every Twitter follower.
[94:23.28]Please.
[94:24.89]Hey, my friends.
[94:27.21]So am I correct in understanding that we have Seabear placing $100 on Team Star?
[94:31.56]There's a chance I might have to play, though.
[94:32.82]If I have to play and I'm on Star's team, I'm taking the bet back.
[94:35.30]It's illegal.
[94:35.72]Because that's not fair.
[94:36.44]Because I'm awful.
[94:37.32]Yeah.
[94:38.00]And we have Ads.
[94:38.73]But I'll donate it anyway.
[94:39.57]How about that?
[94:40.39]Ads placing $100 on Team Jerma.
[94:41.87]Is that correct?
[94:42.49]Yeah, he's a nice guy.
[94:44.95]He's a nice guy.
[94:45.63]Alright.
[94:45.99]There you go.
[94:47.23]Alright.
[94:47.69]Don't worry about that.
[94:48.54]You'll see that.
[94:52.02]I'll show you how nice I am.
[94:55.50]You're pretty nice.
[94:56.18]He thinks this is a big joke.
[94:58.20]If Jerma's team wins, I will donate $400.
[95:03.03]Alright.
[95:04.14]What happens if you win?
[95:05.86]If I win, I will... Make Jerma donate...
[95:10.55]Well, I don't have any more money.
[95:14.60]I'm broke.
[95:15.90]I'm so broke right now.
[95:17.02]It's not even funny.
[95:17.74]I don't know.
[95:18.05]If I win, I'll, like, have $400.
[95:19.59]I'll, like, go buy clothes.
[95:21.99]Okay, if you win, what can I do?
[95:23.34]I'll do something crazy.
[95:25.28]Like, oh, Jeremy's going to start crazy.
[95:26.91]What am I going to do?
[95:29.14]You can't put us on this.
[95:30.91]I don't know.
[95:31.51]You're already, like, an insane person.
[95:34.09]Like, what is crazy to you?
[95:36.48]I want you to sit down and, like, read a book.
[95:39.72]What?
[95:41.27]Like, on stream?
[95:42.37]No, I want you to read the first four books of Dune.
[95:47.14]And we can talk about it when you're done.
[95:49.19]How long do I have?
[95:52.36]I don't know, like a while.
[95:54.60]This isn't urgent.
[95:56.16]Frank Herbert's dead.
[95:57.94]Do I have more than a couple weeks or do I have like three days?
[96:02.33]No, as long as you want.
[96:04.05]Okay, so three days.
[96:05.73]I'm going to buy all the audiobooks and put them on x10 speed.
[96:09.85]Change the host scale.
[96:11.32]Yeah, I'm going to change the host scale on those Dune books.
[96:15.34]Jeremy, have you ever considered recording your own audiobook?
[96:20.71]A couple times.
[96:22.34]A Frank Herbert's Dune series.
[96:23.66]A Frank Herbert's Dune series.
[96:24.88]I would love to hear a Jerma audiobook.
[96:27.20]I would buy that.
[96:28.42]It would have to be something really that I could get into and think was fun.
[96:32.47]It needs a lot of characters, I think.
[96:33.89]I think you can do a lot of characters.
[96:35.27]It needs a lot of old men.
[96:36.36]It has to be in one take.
[96:39.40]It has to be in one take.
[96:40.63]It does.
[96:41.19]The whole book.
[96:42.77]All 500 pages.
[96:43.95]It's just a one-chapter book.
[96:47.80]Get up and go to the bathroom.
[96:48.84]Hold on, guys.
[96:50.78]I've got to go to the bathroom again.
[96:52.94]Green Eggs and Ham, chapter one.
[96:55.79]Double-decker.
[96:59.45]Double-decker.
[97:02.30]That's an interesting premise.
[97:04.54]Double-decker.
[97:07.90]Why do I think that's so funny?
[97:11.22]I wish I had more money.
[97:16.74]I would donate so much more.
[97:18.97]I'm as broke as you could be right now.
[97:21.58]I have to find a place and having a bunch of work done and...
[97:25.70]I have zero dollars.
[97:27.43]Jeremy, we understand.
[97:28.41]We got the Jerma stream, though.
[97:29.91]Yeah, we love and appreciate everything you've done.
[97:31.66]I can't wait to watch the Jerma stream.
[97:32.82]I hear you've been doing it recently.
[97:34.93]Yeah.
[97:35.29]I haven't been too busy.
[97:37.47]But after Tip of the Hats, I'm going to be watching some Jerma stream.
[97:39.96]Everyone should watch the Jerma stream.
[97:41.88]Speaking of donations, we have our boy Sesko.
[97:47.07]Sesko?
[97:47.89]Donated $500.
[97:48.77]Oh my goodness.
[97:51.19]What is tip of the hat?
[97:52.34]And he says, shout out to Jobs.

[98:05.17]and an anonymous $100 donation.

[99:00.34]There's been a lot of people that put on the post $1,000 mark at this point.
[99:04.94]That's awesome.
[99:05.54]Yeah.
[99:05.80]Well, it's a good time to shout out to the smaller donations.
[99:08.05]Like Jeff from One Step Camp said, it's not about the big donation as great and as awesome as they are.
[99:12.38]$3 and $5 and $10 adds up really fast.
[99:15.74]It does add up fast.
[99:16.56]Look at the number on the top left of the screen.
[99:18.63]Yep.
[99:18.85]We wouldn't be at over $190,000 without those smaller donations either.
[99:23.24]So even if you can't afford a large amount, whatever you have, it's a fantastic cause.
[99:28.32]And we still, and the organization still appreciates all of it.
[99:32.65]Think about it.
[99:34.15]You take the people that have donated more than $1,000, and it's in the big picture, not even really a fraction of the entire amount.
[99:43.99]It's somewhere around one percent.
[99:46.57]Yep.
[99:47.31]That's just a myth whatever you give the small community event Yeah, they're a part of the community small donations and everybody is a pile.
[99:54.34]Yeah That's great.
[99:56.67]That was an on stream stair stab stabby stabby stair set into a matador stab he faints Is he gonna get this pyro?
[100:07.03]That was pretty sweet, though.
[100:08.57]Like, this is in stabby video.
[100:10.15]Shout out to stabby video.
[100:11.61]Got the heavy.
[100:12.53]And then he matadors the medic.
[100:14.49]Are you kidding me?
[100:16.86]That's some genuine stabby sap.
[100:19.26]Oh, my God.
[100:21.10]I am so glad this happened just now.
[100:23.22]Everybody wonders why I first picked him last year.
[100:25.05]Come on.
[100:25.99]Yeah.
[100:26.71]People are questioning Jerma's decisions.
[100:29.09]Are you kidding me?
[100:30.27]He is a five-star spy out of five.
[100:33.90]He faints.
[100:36.02]That was pretty sick.
[100:39.56]Mr. Slim's on a 12-kill spree over here.
[100:43.11]Eight of them on me.
[100:44.39]Tell him to get some spy moves going.
[100:49.30]Shout out to Savvy Savvy.
[100:51.43]That is some vintage Savvy Savvy right there.
[100:54.77]That's going in the folder?
[100:56.62]And that's going in the archives.
[100:58.32]That's not going anywhere.
[101:00.24]That's lasting forever.
[101:01.81]He has been going so hard in these pubs, I would not be surprised if there was a I killed people for charity and made them upset.

[101:52.34]the overall graphic and all the little portraits, all the little guys in there, just waving the little guns around.
[101:58.83]They're ready.
[102:00.53]Those were all made by Kronkodile, our own Kronkodile.
[102:04.26]Shout-outs to him, making all those portraits.
[102:06.16]But, yeah, I programmed that thing.
[102:09.42]What are you guys' favorite portraits, Jerma-ster?
[102:12.46]What are you guys like up there?
[102:14.36]At least from last year.
[102:15.20]I think they're the same this year.
[102:16.36]Maybe a little bit spiced up.
[102:17.98]Maybe a little bit spicier this year.
[102:20.41]I think they run a little better.
[102:22.07]Benjamin Franklin.
[102:23.81]That's a good one.
[102:26.88]Are we talking like from the Dota Fortress?
[102:29.78]Yeah, do you remember...
[102:31.64]I honestly don't remember exactly what they all look like, but... That's fair.
[102:36.11]I remember it was... It was very fair.
[102:37.50]There's like 50 of them.
[102:38.46]Last time I saw it, yeah, there was a lot of them.
[102:40.28]The coolest part about it is how they were like almost like fighting game character select screen.
[102:45.26]Like they're kind of doing their animation, their default animation.
[102:48.08]That was so cool.
[102:50.98]We'll tell you what, all this talk about Dota Fortress, why don't we get set up and do it?
[103:00.28]Why don't we get going and do it?
[103:01.38]We're going to take a pause here from the pub section.
[103:03.80]We're going to get everything set up for the aforementioned overlay and whatnot.
[103:08.09]And we're going to do Dota Fortress 2, I guess.
[103:10.93]It's the sequel, the double.
[103:12.86]Yeah.
[103:12.94]So Dota Fortress is coming up.
[103:14.46]This is kind of maybe the marquee event, a lot of people think, for the Tip of the Hats charity.
[103:19.73]So we're going to take a real quick intermission.
[103:21.61]We're going to be back with Team Star versus Team Jerma.
[103:25.50]And honestly, the best TF2 players really in North America.
[103:29.77]So don't go anywhere.
[103:30.87]Stick around.
