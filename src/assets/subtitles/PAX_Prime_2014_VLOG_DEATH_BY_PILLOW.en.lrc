[00:06.11]My name is Zub, I'm in Seattle for PAX Prime 2014.
[00:08.58]We're gonna see a lot of games, meet a lot of people, and just have a blast, so let's get to it.
[01:18.99]We're going in the crowd.
[01:20.91]Hey guys, I got a new name tag.
[01:22.03]I don't know if this is gonna be mirrored or not,
[01:25.88]I love you, tapes.
[01:27.20]Hi guys, I'm in the hotel room.
[01:29.41]Green Skull is right there.
[01:31.31]I just wanted to, you know, when you do YouTube, you know, you get the good stuff.

[01:39.63]Woo!
[01:41.39]Ballin', ballin'.
[01:43.59]We're going all out.
[01:45.75]Oh God, this is straight down into, what is it, the parking structure?
[01:48.10]Hey, Jerma.
[01:50.12]Hey.
[01:50.36]How are you enjoying PAX so far?
[01:52.34]Pretty good, pretty good.
[01:53.10]It's been a lot of fun.
[01:54.42]I've seen a lot of games, you know.
[01:56.10]I haven't played any of them, but I've seen them.
[01:57.98]I've seen them on the screens, the big ones.
[01:59.58]We just walked in.
[02:03.46]The Mets.
[02:05.40]What am I doing?
[02:06.40]Alright, do something funny.
[02:08.80]Okay.
[02:14.11]That is funny.
[02:16.95]This is why we're here, guys.
[02:19.12]You need like a spray bottle to like, loosen it up.
[02:21.39]See that?
[02:21.73]Let's open up the top.
[02:23.79]Open up the bun.
[02:25.03]There's a bug in there.
[02:27.11]Oh, there's grass in my hamburger.
[02:30.80]I'm a sophisticated eater.
[02:33.08]I'll give us a taste test.
[02:33.96]What was that?
[02:35.24]Let's get from 1 to 10.
[02:38.15]Delicious.
[02:39.47]What do you want me to do?
[02:41.23]Oh, dude, do something funny.
[02:42.69]Dude, Jeremy's like the funniest guy.
[02:44.15]Do something funny, dude.
[02:44.87]And back to the studio.
[02:46.29]You want to do something funny?
[02:47.47]No, yeah, do something funny, Jeremy.
[02:49.20]You want to do something funny to the camera?
[02:51.02]Yeah, dude, do it, do it.
[02:52.08]This guy's hilarious.
[02:53.80]You want to get some footage for that camera?
[02:56.44]I'm going to take a selfie.
[02:57.46]How much was that camera?
[02:58.22]It looks expensive.
[03:00.52]It's an expensive camera.
[03:01.86]Is that one of those expensive cameras?
[03:03.33]I'll give you some footage, alright?
[03:05.43]I'll tell you a little story.
[03:07.59]Tell me a story, Jeremy.
[03:08.75]A story about a guy I know.
[03:09.77]His name happens to be... You have no idea where you're going with this from the very beginning.
[03:15.27]Cut that part out.
[03:17.03]A story about a guy I know named Orp.
[03:20.12]A guy no-named?
[03:21.14]A guy named Orp.
[03:22.98]He was a prince among men, and he got... A prince among... I think he's a king among men.
[03:32.08]No, he was the king's son, so he's a prince.
[03:40.37]We're pretty far out.
[03:43.54]Oh, it's pretty spooky.
[03:44.90]If you're looking over the edge, it's pretty spooky.
[03:48.84]What the fuck are you guys doing up here?
[04:00.15]Look over the edge.
[04:01.33]Look over the edge.
[04:02.19]Alright, okay everybody, we're gonna go and buy new shoes for Jerma.
[04:06.15]I just want to get a new pair of shoes.
[04:07.91]Because that's what you're wearing.
[04:09.85]Get a look at those shoes.
[04:10.73]Those are brand spanking new.
[04:12.26]Do you like clean your sneakers?
[04:14.40]Are you like one of those?
[04:15.16]He's brand new.
[04:16.84]I've never heard of Fila.
[04:17.82]Do they still do shoes?
[04:19.26]You've never heard of Fila?
[04:20.22]Yeah, but do they still do shoes?
[04:22.00]Obviously, yes, because I just bought them, sir.
[04:25.13]I don't remember buying Fila shoes.
[04:26.37]Well, maybe back in like 1968.
[04:30.72]Hey!
[04:32.18]I nearly died.
[04:33.22]That's not cool, man.
[04:35.44]They hit him and you nearly died.
[04:39.07]Hey!
[04:39.75]What?
[04:39.95]Oh my god, that was... They put so many arrows in these... I'm getting out of here.
[04:47.75]Help!
[04:48.29]Help me!
[04:55.12]Imagine the enemy team right now.
[04:56.20]I'm using a controller and we're fucking...
[04:58.81]Look at my score!
[05:00.23]Like, this is not a terrible fucking score.
[05:03.04]Smoke outside.
