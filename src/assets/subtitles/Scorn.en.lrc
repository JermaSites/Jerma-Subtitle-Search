[00:08.07]I have returned!
[00:14.93]I'm back!
[00:22.30]Hi.
[00:23.74]How are you?
[00:25.84]Good day to you.
[00:27.88]Safe travels.
[00:31.00]Hey!
[00:31.16]I'm the Warcraft guy!
[00:32.62]You remember me?
[00:40.10]I'm good.
[00:40.60]I'm good.
[00:40.98]I'm good.
[00:42.26]NPR Andy.
[00:43.28]Yeah.
[00:46.24]That's really cool.
[00:49.25]I did not ever think I was going to be on NPR, but here we are.
[00:53.01]Crazy.
[00:58.23]Disney.
[00:58.65]Oh yeah, I've been all over the place.
[01:03.47]And I'm not done either.
[01:08.65]There's a few things coming up here.
[01:11.23]this, I want to say, next couple weeks.
[01:17.91]That there will be, you'll be able to see.
[01:21.38]Also, official planning of the Battle Act stream is officially underway.
[01:31.95]Going to prove that once and for all.
[01:34.47]You'll see that sooner rather than later.
[01:45.38]And today, we are going to play SCORN.
[01:49.54]I've heard things about this game.
[01:52.92]I've heard this game is not what everybody thought it was.
[01:55.70]I've heard this game is amazing.
[01:58.01]I've heard it's an incredible experience.
[02:00.67]I've heard it's not what somebody was expecting.
[02:03.07]I don't know.
[02:07.47]You're going to rage at this.
[02:10.84]I mean, I don't know.
[02:13.92]It looks creepy.
[02:14.82]It looks cool.
[02:16.06]I'm into it.
[02:16.62]I'm ready to see like how cool it's going to be.
[02:18.46]How scary.
[02:22.81]I saw the same trailer you did.
[02:26.95]Raid someone.
[02:28.21]I just turned my stream off at the first time for like two weeks.
[02:32.57]But I also got something to talk about too.
[02:35.01]So you guys are going to get something here on this channel.
[02:38.14]This kind of end of the week here.
[02:41.02]You are going to get three streams in a row.
[02:44.60]It is Omega Gaming Weekend 2.
[02:48.52]But the only difference this time is it is a contractually obligated Omega Gaming Weekend.
[02:56.04]So I can't delay it, I can't move it, and I can't just do it one 14-hour stream.
[03:01.18]So I'm going to be contractually... You're going to get three streams in a row because I'm contractually obligated to be here.
[03:10.97]I'm going to be playing Gotham Knights.
[03:15.70]It's going to be sponsored by WP.
[03:18.82]for three days in a row.
[03:21.48]And what that means is not only am I going to be playing Gotham Knights for three days, I'm also going to be playing other shit for three straight days.
[03:29.92]So we're going to do another Omega Gaming weekend.
[03:36.85]Maybe some Splatoon.
[03:38.69]Probably some Breath of the Wild.
[03:40.75]Maybe we'll sprinkle in some sorcery.
[03:42.09]I know people have been waiting for that.
[03:51.89]More turmoil?
[03:53.10]No, yeah, I can't play turmoil for eight hours.
[03:55.84]It's not going to happen.
[03:59.80]And look, scary stuff too.
[04:01.14]I want to play the new puppet combo game.
[04:02.99]We'll do that this weekend.
[04:06.19]It's not just going to be Gotham Knights, but Gotham Knights will be a part of each one of these streams.
[04:13.57]And it's not like, oh, yeah, guys, I got up today and, like, I got a headache and my back kind of hurts.
[04:20.19]I'll stream four days from now.
[04:22.33]Nope.
[04:28.78]You should play Guitar Hero.
[04:31.90]I mean, it's been a long time.
[04:34.72]Oh, you better believe I'm going to wear the Nightwing shirt.
[04:36.54]Yes, I am.
[04:36.94]100%. 100%.
[04:44.29]Is it going to be Saturday, Sunday, Monday?
[04:46.55]It's going to be Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[04:49.92]So it's Omega, I don't know, Omega end of the week.
[04:53.16]End.
[04:54.30]Kind of.
[04:54.52]You should play PS1 games.
[05:00.35]Maybe.
[05:03.43]I did that a while, though.
[05:09.14]Yes, I will confirm today the most important announcement you'll hear on this channel over the next six months.
[05:17.79]I will be playing Among Us VR as the sus guy the day it launches.
[05:33.04]I told everybody I promised him I would do it.
[05:36.02]And I'm going to.
[05:37.67]I promised.
[05:40.38]Now that means I could literally play it for 10 minutes.
[05:43.56]But I was kind of thinking of really just cashing in on that meme.
[05:47.86]And look, people are going to come to this channel when I stream that and just be like, wait, this is the sus guy.
[05:53.73]So I'm going to brand the entire channel that way.
[05:57.15]All the branding you see here right now will not be here that day.
[06:00.71]It's going to be the sus face everywhere.
[06:03.01]The stream title is going to be the sus guy finally plays among us.
[06:09.39]All the emotes, all the badges, they're going to be the sus face just for one day only.
[06:13.94]I'm leaning into this.
[06:16.20]I'm cashing out on this meme.
[06:17.84]I get to.
[06:26.49]When does it come out?
[06:28.21]What date does it come out?
[06:29.55]When?
[06:29.97]I don't know.
[06:30.49]I need to prepare for this.
[06:37.31]November 10th.
[06:42.34]You should keep, you should have a sus filter on.
[06:44.64]Wait, have the sus face on my face?
[06:51.60]But I talked about this, right?
[06:52.82]I was concerned about this.
[06:56.86]Because if I do this, I'm gonna break the dollhouse viewer record.
[07:01.88]You know what I understand what I'm saying?
[07:03.18]I will break the dollhouse viewer record, and I'll never be able to do anything else.
[07:06.88]I'll have to be the sus guy forever.
[07:16.35]Okay, let me ask you this.
[07:18.01]What an inflated ego.
[07:19.01]No, I'm just saying.
[07:19.83]I'm preparing for the worst here.
[07:22.77]So, if I do the sus guy, and I've rebranded the whole channel to be the sus guy, and I play Among Us, and there's like 80,000 people watching, and the next day, like 50,000 people are watching, and they're like, dude, where's more Among Us, sus guy?
[07:37.73]I mean, should I just cash in for like a month?
[07:46.43]But then all the long-term people that have been watching this channel will just leave.
[07:52.77]And I'll go back to the normal viewership numbers that I've been seeing.
[07:56.22]And it'll all only be among us Susky viewers.
[08:00.00]I'm gonna be in trouble here.
[08:01.22]Maybe I shouldn't do this.
[08:06.32]Well, we'll see.
[08:09.32]It's gonna be a new community.
[08:13.29]That's so stupid.
[08:14.69]Alright, let me tweet this.
[08:15.57]I'll be right back.
[09:02.76]Good thing I got that one off.
[09:03.80]I had 1% battery.
[09:05.20]Good thing I got that off.
[09:09.56]RT game with the raid.
[09:12.68]Hey, what's up?
[09:15.60]Spent some time with RT over the last few days here.
[09:21.03]Good to see him again.
[09:24.21]Trying to actually go do things with friends and family.
[09:30.97]Been kind of just...
[09:33.94]You're kind of in work mode, essentially, for a long time.
[09:36.92]So it's really nice to see a lot of people.
[09:39.86]I'm so aloof, you guys would not even... You don't even understand.
[09:43.64]But, hey!
[09:44.94]Thanks for the raid.
[09:46.28]Saw Etalyx.
[09:46.98]Hung out with Etalyx again, too.
[09:48.44]That's cool.
[09:49.22]Good to see everybody.
[09:53.50]Are you, uh... You played Overwatch 2 for 80 hours.
[09:58.86]I didn't.
[10:03.50]Alright, you guys ready?
[10:04.18]No, we're done stalling.
[10:04.98]It's time to play some... SCORN.
[10:08.74]That's what I imagine when I click on... When I click New Game here.
[10:12.62]It's gonna go... SCORN.
[10:17.23]Does it do that?
[10:17.71]Hey, and we're live!
[10:26.09]Does it do it?
[10:28.56]When I click New Game, is it gonna go... SCORN.
[10:30.34]SCORN.
[10:43.61]Is that me?
[10:51.99]Who's that?
[11:01.97]Discord.
[11:03.88]Fuck.
[11:19.50]Ew, Jesus, it's loud.
[11:21.10]Hold on.
[11:23.64]What the fuck is going on?
[11:24.50]Ow.
[11:50.23]This game doesn't have any hints.
[11:51.55]Good luck.
[11:52.67]Well, that's what you guys are for.
[11:54.53]I'll get them.
[11:57.84]I'll get them.
[12:09.11]So I asked this in pre-stream.
[12:10.45]Is this a Gogeta game?
[12:11.97]Does it actually, do we, are we going to get some of that or no?
[12:20.11]it's not what is it it's a this is a okay no it's not well I'm not even going to explain that because the people that it's the people that know you know what I mean uh the sensitivity is way too high and by the way this fov is uh oh no okay uh controls sensitivity right
[12:44.54]Camera settings?
[12:45.28]Alright, here we go.
[12:46.38]Way down.
[12:46.88]F-O-V.
[12:47.66]Does this have a numerical value?
[12:51.60]What would this be?
[12:56.37]What's 90?
[12:56.81]Am I at 90 right here?
[12:58.63]I wonder.
[12:58.91]I don't know.
[12:59.87]I feel like I need a numerical value here.
[13:01.55]Alright, let's try that.
[13:07.70]It's better.
[13:08.68]A little too low.
[13:10.74]I have to do my settings!
[13:11.68]Just wait!
[13:17.49]That's way too high.
[13:25.01]That's still a little high, but it's better.
[13:27.13]Alright, that's good.
[13:27.65]That's fine.
[13:28.20]How does it look?
[13:30.98]Turn off mouse smoothing?
[13:40.34]Oh, smoothing.
[13:41.42]Okay.
[13:44.30]Alright, so let's go.
[13:44.93]I gotta press this button.
[13:47.03]I gotta figure out the puzzle.
[13:48.47]Alright, so what I have to do is I just woke up in a distant land that I'm not familiar with.
[13:54.76]Do I have a map?
[13:56.90]I mean, the game looks really nice.
[14:13.72]Should I be walking?
[14:16.60]Right?
[14:16.80]I feel like I shouldn't just be sprinting around.
[14:20.48]Cool.
[14:20.72]Is this game scary?
[14:25.66]Should I turn it up?
[14:44.74]Yeah.
[14:48.70]This is scary.
[14:58.61]The fuck?
[15:00.37]Fuck.
[15:01.68]This is crazy.
[15:05.36]How can I tell if I can open these doors?
[15:12.56]Is there fall damage?
[15:16.43]Okay, I can't.
[15:16.97]I'm just gonna go down there.
[15:25.46]Everything looks cool.
[15:30.82]I heard some move.
[15:31.34]Okay, so it's just left-click to interact.
[15:42.45]Why does it look good, but also like a PS2 game?
[15:44.91]I think that's why I like it.
[15:49.88]Let's think that.
[15:50.60]Is it filter?
[15:57.58]What do you mean filter?
[16:05.21]TOS.
[16:05.47]What do you mean TOS?
[16:07.43]What are you talking?
[16:13.38]Keep it on.
[16:17.00]I don't care.
[16:19.51]Ignore it.
[16:19.87]Alright.
[16:20.79]So I can't touch this.
[16:21.67]I need to have... Whoa.
[16:23.65]That sounded fake.
[16:27.82]That was a fake whoa.
[16:29.32]It was.
[16:30.62]I have to admit to that.
[16:31.94]That was actually fake.
[16:34.66]It's been, like, two weeks since I've been live, guys.
[16:36.26]I gotta remember how to, like, actually stream normally.
[16:39.18]That was genuinely I made that up.
[16:41.06]Me saying, whoa, I got caught.
[16:42.50]I actually made that up.
[16:43.94]So, like, I gotta get back into this.
[16:46.56]I forgot how to, like, pretend to have fun.
[16:52.56]What's this thing?
[17:02.56]Whoa.
[17:09.25]Whoa.
[17:11.07]That was real.
[17:13.41]It just sounded a little deflated.
[17:15.37]Okay, so I have a thing on my arm now?
[17:25.06]What the hell?
[17:25.80]That's weird.
[17:30.54]Is this a toilet?
[17:31.36]This looks like a toilet of some kind.
[17:32.79]Like, what is this?
[17:33.31]Is it an alien toilet?
[17:40.00]Alright, well it's definitely right here.
[17:44.38]Use direction?
[17:45.80]Wait, what?
[17:58.43]I don't get it.
[17:58.85]Okay, wait, I can switch between them?
[18:06.10]Okay.
[18:07.34]Just turn them both on?
[18:15.70]How do I get out?
[18:19.40]How do I get out of the blood pressure reading machine?
[18:22.60]Oh, exit, right, okay.
[18:32.73]Oh, there we go.
[18:33.17]130 over fucking 70, dude, I'm fine.
[18:36.97]Yo, I didn't make it.
[18:55.53]Oh, come on.
[18:56.27]I have to keep it there until... Okay.
[19:02.65]I need to stay in here.
[19:04.41]It's not just activate and walk away.
[19:06.51]It's activate, stay in here.
[19:09.75]Now... We exit and we sprint.
[19:17.54]There we are.
[19:18.16]Okay, I get it.
[19:18.90]Just give me an extra second or two.
[19:27.18]So can I attack with this thing?
[19:28.24]Alright, I definitely have to climb up this thing, right?
[19:37.67]Get to the top of that and activate it.
[19:41.57]He's never going to complete this game.
[19:43.41]That's what everybody says about every puzzle game that I've ever played, okay?
[19:47.97]I'm going to beat this.
[19:49.31]I will complete it.
[19:51.33]Everybody says that every time I play a puzzle game.
[19:54.85]Hey, dude, he's never going to beat this ever.
[19:58.19]And then I beat it.
[19:58.85]Like, it takes me an extra four to six hours than a normal human, but I still do.
[20:04.54]Alright, what is this?
[20:05.18]Oh my god, okay.
[20:21.21]I don't know exactly know what I'm doing here, but.
[20:25.15]OK, I can.
[20:27.91]I don't know.
[20:30.45]Alright, whatever.
[20:34.98]Is it fall damage?
[20:38.82]Remember, you're an alien.
[20:42.28]What does this do?
[20:53.09]Okay.
[20:53.33]I don't get it.
[21:02.62]This game sucks.
[21:05.46]I'm done.
[21:05.76]Just kidding.
[21:12.53]Oh, I can push this, right?
[21:17.83]Why does it tell me I can touch this?
[21:23.33]This thing's on a track.
[21:24.34]So how do I get it to move on the track?
[21:26.42]It goes like this over here.
[21:29.12]And then what the hell is this thing?
[21:32.52]Alright.
[21:44.83]So I am on the track.
[21:46.93]Track moves like this.
[21:49.93]I've got this is correct because this I want this to go down here Otherwise it would just spin around in a circle around this whole environment.
[21:58.31]So I've already got it in the right place I just have to move it and Trying to figure that out It's gonna be the challenge Okay Can I pick it up
[22:22.16]What if I just leave it here?
[22:24.10]No.
[22:26.92]How do I activate this?
[22:27.74]How do I get this to move, like, go?
[22:29.70]Is it going to take you forever?
[22:35.64]No, it's not.
[22:36.42]It's the first.
[22:37.10]I'm fine.
[22:37.59]I just need to know how to turn the thing on.
[22:42.01]Is this it?
[22:50.20]What is all this wacky shit in this cathedral, wherever we are?
[22:54.12]Do I have to get it here?
[22:57.24]Alright, hold on.
[23:00.16]What is this thing?
[23:01.44]Alright.
[23:18.61]How do I get the chair to move?
[23:28.00]Because this is... I did this correct.
[23:30.14]I just need to move the chair.
[23:34.28]It's a two-player puzzle.
[23:35.86]What?
[23:36.26]No, it's not.
[23:36.78]That's a lie.
[23:42.05]What can I do with this thing?
[23:51.55]I am not going to be one of the people that said they quit this game in ten minutes.
[23:56.00]Because they thought it was going to be like a... I'm not one of those people.
[24:01.78]I'm not quitting the game in 10 minutes.
[24:10.38]No, I'm not doing it.
[24:11.44]Wait, what's this?
[24:13.04]Oh, I know what this is.
[24:19.24]Okay, so can I move it?
[24:25.87]That's to get it to go up that way.
[24:32.35]Very obviously, I need to figure out how to move the chair.
[24:38.55]How?
[24:45.48]I need to get that thing to fucking move that way.
[24:48.74]Is there like a power thing I have to turn on?
[24:54.74]There's more places to explore.
[24:56.20]Oh, okay.
[24:56.68]I don't even know where... I don't know what direction I came from.
[25:02.26]I'm just gonna go this way?
[25:03.02]I need a map.
[25:06.66]Oh, shit.
[25:07.24]Okay.
[25:08.66]I thought that was a concentrated puzzle.
[25:10.06]That's my bad.
[25:20.71]Okay, so...
[25:25.27]What is this?
[25:29.84]Okay, so that scoops up whatever's in there.
[25:39.89]So I need to put something in there to scoop it up in here.
[25:43.71]Alright, so how do I scoop some stuff in there?
[25:47.85]What should I scoop?
[26:04.94]Okay.
[26:09.48]Dude, what are you doing?
[26:12.19]Why?
[26:12.77]No, pick up one of these cubes.
[26:14.35]Pick up one of these.
[26:15.55]Scoop this stuff.
[26:18.99]Okay, I can't do this.
[26:24.04]So they're both scoopers.
[26:28.98]Both are scoopers.
[26:31.66]And I can't use them right now, so I'm going to leave.
[26:39.66]I'm actually, I'm very interested in this game.
[26:41.86]I'm very interested.
[26:46.24]I'll tell you right now, I'm not very good at puzzles, but I'm very interested in this game.
[26:49.88]I want to know who the fuck I am.
[26:52.08]Why am I here?
[26:52.58]What am I doing here?
[26:53.60]Right?
[26:54.70]That to me is worth me doing puzzles.
[26:56.52]I want to know what I'm doing here.
[26:57.79]Who am I?
[26:58.31]Why am I here?
[26:58.75]Okay, let me go this way.
[27:18.31]Can't activate these.
[27:20.43]Alright, give me something to give me like a thing of meat or something to scoop, right?
[27:29.71]I've got nothing to scoop.
[27:32.07]I actually don't have anything to scoop.
[27:33.21]There's all these scoopers and I can't scoop anything.
[27:49.18]You'll see.
[27:50.38]No help.
[27:50.91]No help.
[27:51.37]No help.
[27:52.79]That's fine.
[27:53.19]I'll figure it out.
[27:54.79]I'll figure it out.
[28:01.19]When is he going to start SCORN?
[28:03.11]Scorning?
[28:03.57]What's this thing?
[28:29.93]Do I have to, like, get in this thing and get, like, sawed?
[28:32.23]This shit's so weird.
[28:41.53]It's like this organic tech.
[28:45.12]It's shit.
[28:46.00]You know what I'm saying?
[28:47.06]It's creepy.
[28:51.00]Organic tech.
[28:53.64]Weird.
[28:54.02]Weird.
[29:10.01]Should I pick up like a skeleton or something and grind it up?
[29:18.22]I can hear something.
[29:41.43]What's the point of this?
[29:42.25]Yo, what do I do?
[29:50.35]Did you beat Elden Ring yet?
[29:56.57]I got to whatever that horse boss is at the very beginning.
[29:59.95]And I just... Puzzle games are more my thing, so I quit it.
[30:04.13]Because I'm not really into it.
[30:06.15]I'm more into puzzle stuff.
[30:09.89]That game's just too fucking hard.
[30:10.89]Like, it's just, you know what I mean?
[30:12.37]I like stuff like this.
[30:16.34]Okay, wait, what about over here?
[30:19.48]Nothing.
[30:27.87]I already went down here.
[30:28.71]Okay, so very obviously, I have to grind up something.
[30:33.82]Put it into one of the scoop machines.
[30:36.81]And then the scoop machine will scoop out a, I don't know, something to use?
[30:40.87]I don't know what to do.
[30:46.37]How come there's not every 15 seconds the game pauses and freezes and tells me how to walk?
[30:51.86]And, like, what interact button does?
[30:53.84]Okay.
[30:58.40]Try using your brain.
[31:00.80]I didn't think to do that.
[31:06.74]Follow the rails.
[31:08.06]I just did that, didn't I?
[31:08.92]There's the grind thing.
[31:12.62]Alright, I'm going to follow this one.
[31:29.73]Yeah, I... How do I turn the cart on?
[31:34.03]I understand the concept of moving the rails and changing the directions and everything, but how do I turn this?
[31:38.45]I almost said stupid.
[31:40.07]It's at this game.
[31:40.71]I almost said stupid.
[31:43.32]That's not what I was going to say.
[31:45.16]How do I turn the machine on?
[31:48.16]Explore more.
[31:55.36]Where have I not gone?
[32:03.53]can't do this.
[32:05.01]It's gotta be something to do.
[32:06.00]Maybe over here?
[32:15.06]Did I go down here yet?
[32:16.14]I don't think so.
[32:21.11]No, I did.
[32:21.65]I can hear a sound over here.
[32:41.56]Wait, what's this?
[32:44.06]What?
[32:46.62]Why can't I use this?
[32:47.57]What is this?
[33:10.66]You have to pay attention to every possible path.
[33:16.30]I'm gonna have to get a whiteboard in here.
[33:25.46]I'm gonna have to map this out.
[33:26.72]There's no map?
[33:27.50]There's no map.
[33:30.40]Wait, somebody said you went down every single path except for the correct one.
[33:33.79]That's not possible!
[33:43.50]You literally did.
[33:44.50]There's an elevator.
[34:01.97]What elevator?
[34:07.77]You keep missing controls.
[34:10.15]What?
[34:13.04]It's where the scoop is.
[34:14.32]It's the concrete level all over again.
[34:19.39]I just don't understand what I'm supposed to do!
[34:28.08]Look, you guys are gonna make me part of like a video essay on look at how spoiled we've become with all these developers giving us every hint we've ever needed.
[34:36.75]StreamerJerma985 couldn't fucking find his way around SCORN because there's no map and there's no Fable 2 breadcrumbs.
[34:44.35]You guys are gonna make me part of a video essay on how gamers need all this shit nowadays.
[35:07.52]I could dodge a fucking axe on stream, and I'm gonna.
[35:10.08]I'm gonna.
[35:10.68]I'm gonna dodge a battle axe on stream.
[35:12.34]And you're not gonna be able to say shit for months.
[35:18.32]You just ignored it again?
[35:19.56]What?
[35:20.46]Where?
[35:21.24]What did I ignore?
[35:22.06]I don't get it.
[35:22.96]Everything is made out of meat and bones and shit.
[35:26.16]What am I missing?
[35:26.93]I missed something?
[35:28.79]Where?
[35:35.05]It's in here?
[35:56.75]It's in the snow.
[35:57.47]It's in the scoop room.
[36:00.44]No, it's in the scoop room.
[36:02.78]I don't- I don't- Guys, if you paid me a million dollars to find the scoop room right now in ten seconds, I wouldn't be able to do it.
[36:09.75]Let's try.
[36:10.13]Let's see if I can get a million dollars.
[36:11.87]Ten.
[36:12.99]Nine.
[36:14.03]Eight.
[36:15.09]Seven.
[36:16.19]Six.
[36:17.31]Five.
[36:18.39]Four.
[36:19.60]Three.
[36:20.88]Two- Well, that's not fair, because it would have taken more than ten seconds to get here.
[36:24.28]One- Okay, did I- did I get- did I make a million dollars?
[36:27.80]If I go straight from here, did I get a million?
[36:35.38]Nope, I don't get a million dollars.
[36:36.52]That would have been such an easy million.
[36:49.01]It's the same room.
[36:58.61]Okay.
[36:59.96]You're talking about the room that has the scoop machine in it.
[37:06.82]No, I don't owe you a million.
[37:08.04]I just said if I got there in 10 seconds, I would get a million.
[37:10.30]It's over here.
[37:11.10]It's not over there.
[37:13.63]Okay.
[37:20.75]Alright.
[37:21.03]Where?
[37:21.29]Where?
[37:22.25]Oh, my fucking God.
[37:23.81]I couldn't even see this.
[37:25.55]I didn't even see this.
[37:27.63]This, like, just didn't exist in my brain.
[37:30.14]Everything's made out of fucking bones.
[37:31.96]Ugh.
[37:44.42]I walked in here.
[37:46.06]Everything's bones and, like, sinew, okay?
[37:48.82]It's hard to know where I need to go.
[37:50.84]Okay, just don't... Nobody talk.
[38:01.16]From the elevator, straight ahead is the big room, okay?
[38:06.55]Lock it in.
[38:07.51]Straight ahead from the elevator, big room.
[38:09.31]Big room with a bunch of big shit in it.
[38:11.01]Left, from the elevator, left.
[38:13.86]Is... Dinosaur ribcage machine.
[38:17.44]Left is dinosaur ribcage machine.
[38:19.36]Got it.
[38:19.72]Locked in.
[38:21.81]Dinosaur ribcage machine.
[38:23.39]Big room.
[38:24.35]On the right side... Over here, on the right side... Left is dinosaur ribcage area.
[38:32.69]Straight ahead is big room.
[38:33.75]Over on the right side, we have hallway leading to... A...
[38:40.19]wires and then here we are leading to a um I heard I don't I don't know let's go this is on the right side remember I'm not gonna be able to remember this
[39:11.47]It's alarming how many message deleted there are.
[39:13.97]Okay, what does that mean though?
[39:19.73]How do I get into that room?
[39:24.42]Where's my little fucking robot that's flying around that can be like, oh, of course, go that way.
[39:30.90]No, I think that if you go one meter to the left.
[39:35.39]Where's my inventory?
[39:37.51]Where's my a million ammo?
[39:51.22]This is still on the right side, by the way.
[39:56.11]Still the first puzzle and you're 40 minutes into the game.
[39:58.19]No.
[39:58.89]No, the stream has been live for 40 minutes.
[40:00.97]I've only been playing the game for about 20.
[40:03.47]Don't lie.
[40:04.95]Don't lie.
[40:06.43]Don't lie.
[40:07.85]It's been about 16 minutes or so.
[40:14.81]Okay, so it's just a big circle.
[40:17.11]And there's nothing here.
[40:18.89]It's just this.
[40:20.57]I don't know where I don't actually don't know where I am.
[40:23.52]Did I do a few?
[40:24.06]Okay, did a big circle.
[40:24.92]There's the big room.
[40:27.24]So it's a gigantic circle that goes around the whole thing.
[40:29.78]So what does this do?
[40:31.58]What's this?
[40:53.74]God fucking dammit.
[40:57.94]What is this?
[40:58.36]I don't even know what the object is.
[41:18.61]Oh my god, this is gonna be horrible.
[41:20.47]What do I need to- I need to move this?
[41:21.99]Oh shit.
[41:26.37]Okay.
[41:30.06]Do I have to get this all the way around to the other side?
[41:33.20]I don't get it.
[41:33.56]Okay.
[41:39.40]But what's the goal?
[41:42.44]Is the goal to get the lit up light to move?
[42:02.77]Okay, which ones can even move?
[42:04.01]Okay, they can only move into the holes.
[42:06.55]So then, alright, so can I go like this?
[42:11.78]I can't move this down.
[42:12.70]Can I move this up?
[42:16.86]Okay, wait, no.
[42:17.52]What if I do this?
[42:19.86]Can I pick it up with the other one?
[42:21.28]What happens if I pick it up?
[42:28.11]Like, does this do anything?
[42:38.60]Okay, so I have to get... What about the other eggs?
[42:42.24]The ones with the lights on them, maybe?
[42:51.19]I'm imagining that this has to come up.
[42:53.63]Like the ones with the lights?
[42:54.51]That's what it looks like, I guess.
[43:00.23]I don't know.
[43:02.13]I'm gonna try it.
[43:23.65]Okay.
[43:24.09]Does that matter?
[43:25.79]Because that one has lights on it.
[43:40.74]I can't hear how that sounded.
[43:41.82]It probably sounded really fucking bad.
[43:43.30]Alright.
[43:44.76]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[43:45.20]What was that?
[43:47.03]I just... I didn't even... I missed the... Who cares what my voice sounded like?
[43:51.37]What did I just do?
[43:52.73]What happened?
[43:54.11]It broke and fell down.
[43:58.47]So that was not... It shattered and fell.
[44:03.46]Down there.
[44:06.78]It's a... Alright, well let me get the other one.
[44:20.50]Oh, that's really annoying.
[44:21.94]Okay.
[44:24.32]Um... Get out of the fucking way!
[44:58.66]Shit alright.
[45:02.66]I have to get.
[45:03.18]This is this is going to move this one here.
[45:09.94]Where am I bringing it?
[45:13.27]These are locked in place, but can I move these?
[45:15.19]I can move these over here.
[45:16.27]I don't think it's that complicated.
[45:21.39]Bring this all the way down.
[45:23.77]Bring this all the way up.
[45:25.87]Right?
[45:29.51]Because I have to get this out of the way.
[45:31.72]Let's go like this for now.
[45:32.78]I don't know.
[45:36.84]So what if I do this?
[45:43.06]Can I at least get this up here?
[45:44.16]I can, alright.
[45:48.18]There's that.
[45:50.90]But I have a new problem.
[45:51.80]Problem solved.
[46:00.27]Kind of.
[46:42.76]This better be it.
[46:49.51]Did I do it?
[46:54.59]I mean, no, it's close.
[46:58.98]Okay, I gotta go.
[47:00.00]I gotta be able to go that way.
[47:03.76]Can I move this all the way down?
[47:14.50]Fuck!
[47:15.06]Alright, what about... Hold on.
[47:21.36]I think I got it.
[47:31.19]Yeah, that's it.
[47:31.65]I got it.
[47:38.77]I hope this is right, otherwise I screwed this whole... No, shit!
[47:41.81]I gotta...
[47:52.35]Can I zoom in?
[47:59.75]This sucks.
[48:09.11]I think I... I think I screwed the whole thing up.
[48:16.05]Because I can go over here, but I can't go down.
[48:23.13]There's no scenario where I can get this up here.
[48:28.21]I have to move everything.
[48:31.77]What needs to be moved?
[48:34.07]Somebody just said I hate this game.
[48:36.69]It's... I'm playing it.
[48:47.40]Let me move this.
[48:48.18]Because there's an area where I can get this down.
[49:02.78]Can I move this?
[49:03.96]I can't move this up.
[49:06.50]I can't go across here.
[49:07.54]I need to get that single one down here.
[49:15.19]Hold on.
[49:23.19]All this shit has to be out of the way completely.
[49:28.39]Like it has to be.
[49:28.97]There's no other way to do this.
[49:35.24]No, no, no.
[49:35.54]Don't move this yet.
[49:38.72]This now comes over here and comes down, right?
[49:40.54]Then this comes over.
[49:48.48]All the way over here.
[49:49.12]Then I should be able to... No, because this has to... Wait, I got it.
[50:06.48]I got it.
[50:06.80]We're good.
[50:12.74]Oh, thank God.
[50:13.30]Okay.
[50:17.57]Hell, this is right.
[50:21.41]Average thinker.
[50:30.12]I got it.
[50:30.60]I'm fine.
[50:33.76]What are you doing?
[50:34.42]What do you mean?
[51:03.13]I'm going to have to grind this thing up.
[51:08.06]I'm going to have to grind that up.
[51:12.64]Yeah, okay, I get it.
[51:13.82]There's a wild puzzle.
[51:20.12]Man, puzzles.
[51:20.72]That's what I'm known for here.
[51:30.86]Back down into that room where the kind of saw is Doritos now it's not gonna work this time.
[51:42.21]It's not gonna work Okay I'm imagining I have to take it probably came down this side right burn this into my brain
[52:00.95]This image right here.
[52:01.89]Okay, I got it.
[52:06.56]So that means that this is where the scooper is.
[52:10.26]If I see this exact image.
[52:13.60]With like the thing hanging in over there.
[52:15.02]Okay.
[52:20.76]Stop saying Doritos.
[52:21.90]It doesn't mean anything.
[52:40.51]What the fuck is going on?
[52:41.71]What is that sound?
[52:42.41]Where is it?
[52:52.74]Oh shit!
[52:53.82]It's above me!
[53:54.28]You alright?
[53:54.66]Wait, where's this going?
[54:00.78]Is it gonna go over here?
[54:02.80]So where do I want this to end up?
[54:08.00]So if it stays on this track, which it could, it could.
[54:11.92]It's gonna go in here.
[54:15.45]Into the scoop room.
[54:17.72]Which I don't think I'm ready for that yet.
[54:20.18]Right?
[54:21.42]I think I need to... I need to... Use the blade.
[54:27.60]Right?
[54:27.78]I think that's what I have to do.
[54:29.56]So let me see where that is.
[54:30.46]I think it's... Where is it?
[54:33.43]Over here?
[54:33.75]I gotta get it into memory.
[54:35.93]Alright, so I need to move... Where is this one going?
[54:40.63]I gotta close that up and see where this is.
[54:42.85]What's this over here?
[54:46.00]The track will go over here.
[54:46.98]Through here.
[54:49.40]Around the corner.
[54:53.60]Into... Here it is.
[54:56.02]Alright.
[54:56.68]So... Uh... Okay.
[55:03.50]Let's... I'm gonna go move the tracks.
[55:07.66]Why is everybody saying yay and nay?
[55:09.29]Okay.
[55:15.43]Alright, so I gotta close up that one back here.
[55:17.29]Because... You know what I mean?
[55:21.41]I have to move this.
[55:22.63]So this one is already correct.
[55:25.15]But I have to close this one.
[55:28.08]Over here.
[55:31.32]So this one has to come back over this way.
[55:36.04]So close up that one.
[55:40.04]And that's the only one that needs to be closed.
[55:43.39]Yes.
[55:43.59]Alright.
[55:43.83]Alright.
[55:49.13]That's good.
[56:03.40]Okay.
[56:06.14]So, it's... Where am I?
[56:07.44]It's this one over here.
[56:11.86]Where's it going?
[56:12.76]It goes...
[56:19.31]Okay, so that's what I need.
[56:20.83]That's correct?
[56:22.48]We good?
[56:23.46]Let's go!
[56:24.80]Let's go!

[56:59.34]Wait, what?
[57:04.02]No, no, no.
[57:04.30]I want to keep going on this track.
[57:05.44]Should I do this?
[57:09.76]Let me see what this does.
[57:11.08]Okay.
[57:26.72]what did I do what did I just do I don't know
[58:11.30]It just feels like I shouldn't be doing this.
[58:20.98]Okay, well, we're going this way.
[58:28.54]And then this wraps all the way around and then it's the... Should I... I don't know.
[58:32.15]Should I put him in this thing?
[58:34.15]Okay.
[58:36.11]Now what?

[59:30.54]Stop!
[59:30.88]Go back!
[59:31.46]I-
[59:44.69]Wait a second.
[59:45.93]Okay, now I can click.
[59:54.08]What the fuck?
[59:54.94]Wait, they go in... What's the point of doing this though?
[60:00.74]What is the point of this?
[60:06.93]What's the point of this?
[60:08.53]Why would I do this?
[60:09.61]What's the point?
[60:30.99]What the hell?
[60:41.74]Hey, wait.
[60:48.35]He's getting up.
[61:04.85]Should I run?
[61:05.47]I feel like I'm... The game is giving me an opportunity to run away.
[61:12.65]Before this guy Michael Myers' me.
[61:15.07]For like the next six hours.
[61:21.57]Help him.

[61:34.36]Why is that sound effect happening right now?
[61:41.24]Help him, please.
[61:46.95]How?
[61:47.49]He's standing.

[63:04.08]Can he use this?
[63:05.90]This would make sense, right?
[63:06.90]Considering that this is his co-op partner.
[63:10.84]Yep.
[63:12.93]What do I do?
[63:17.61]How do I help?
[63:22.82]How do I help him?
[63:37.52]Jesus.
[63:42.88]Dude.
[63:46.73]Oh my God.
[63:49.89]Ah.
[64:02.23]You're gonna need a gun.
[64:02.93]Let me give you the, let me just take a look on my menu and find the thing with zero ammo and the gun that I never upgraded and it's a pistol with maybe one bullet in it.

[64:13.46]Let's go.
[64:22.34]So let's try, let's get, let's get that big door open.

[64:26.22]Come on.
[64:39.52]You didn't even give you a new friend a name?
[64:40.82]We just met.
[64:48.54]I got a... I don't know.
[64:57.58]After a little while, I'll come up with a good name.
[65:01.52]Alright, come over here.
[65:04.98]And touch it.
[65:06.00]Go.
[65:06.40]Come and put your hand over here.
[65:17.22]Alright, come on.
[65:19.46]Come over here.
[65:20.02]We'll get this open.
[65:32.51]Dude, this sucks.
[65:38.93]This is like fucking horrible.
[65:53.75]Okay, so this is open.
[65:56.29]Alright, so stay right there for a sec.
[66:16.22]Did you just lock me in here?
[66:21.44]I was just about to give... I was about to give you a name too.
[66:33.85]No, you locked him in there.
[66:50.45]It's gonna be some like AI took control and has been like killing us.
[66:54.85]I don't know.
[66:57.72]It's some, it's gonna be some alien, alien tech.
[67:01.50]You know what I mean?
[67:16.86]Holy shit.
[67:23.63]Yeah, humanity is being, like, harvested by the aliens.
[67:28.57]And they're using us for their alien tech.
[67:33.75]Alright.
[67:44.20]Alright.
[67:54.69]Was that creepy?
[68:03.13]Like put my face in there.
[68:33.44]He's gonna break open.
[68:40.88]Alright, this room with all these pods.
[68:46.13]I do anything with this.
[68:49.15]Looks like a quake map.
[68:54.71]Wait, what am I doing with this?
[68:55.81]Am I just flying?
[68:56.97]OK.
[68:57.67]Uh.
[68:58.23]Alright up there.
[70:07.28]I knew it.
[70:09.28]Fucking alien tech.
[70:10.42]I don't know why I think that's funny.
[70:17.38]It's just, I don't know, it's just a word.
[70:22.01]Am I inside of a thing that's just alive or something?
[70:24.95]This thing's alive.
[70:26.91]What does this do for me?
[70:36.39]What does this do for me?
[70:37.19]I don't know.
[70:37.51]I don't get it.
[70:41.95]Um, I guess I can turn this a different way?
[70:45.85]Or, no, I can't.
[70:50.39]What else is in here?
[70:51.05]Can I move this?
[70:54.27]Okay, I can move this again to there?
[70:57.19]I don't know.
[70:59.23]I'm gonna try it.
[71:09.65]You're... Oh, I'm so sorry.
[71:11.87]That probably hurt your ears.
[71:12.65]Have you ever seen Alien?
[71:15.19]Yeah.
[71:18.82]Um, let me...
[71:21.87]Do I just get another one and put it somewhere else?
[71:25.67]Do I have access to any more of those?
[71:30.12]I saw those things sticking out.
[71:32.12]I definitely have access to more of those things.
[71:34.18]Right?
[71:34.76]Am I going to place them here?
[71:35.60]I think I know what I have to do.
[71:37.58]Let me get out of here.
[71:38.26]Alright.
[71:38.82]There's more of those... The alien tech.
[71:45.90]Globes.
[71:46.40]Do I have to pick one out and put it over here?
[71:53.91]Or do I have to pick that out and put it in here?
[71:56.33]I don't know.
[72:01.90]That's what I'm going with.
[72:02.62]That's what I think I have to do, so I'm going to try it.
[72:09.96]What, is it back here, right?
[72:13.38]Yeah, okay.
[72:14.46]So can I just pull one of these off?
[72:19.24]I gotta be, there's gotta be a way to get that off, right?
[72:23.52]Something to do with this.
[72:25.34]But I don't have whatever that attachment is or something yet.
[72:29.64]Huh.
[72:29.96]Okay.
[72:30.34]So that's not what I have to do.
[72:39.72]No.
[72:40.85]I'm seeing a lot of not like this.
[72:42.85]Go back.
[72:43.21]Go back.
[72:49.01]So do I just pull it out of there and then...
[72:55.56]Put it in one of the other slots?
[72:57.54]That's what I'm thinking.
[72:59.70]It looks like I couldn't do that, though.
[73:08.02]Alright, I'm going to look over here.
[73:10.39]Is there anything else?
[73:16.29]Is this a big circle?
[73:17.49]Oh!
[73:22.51]Oh!
[73:23.51]Oh!
[73:24.38]Found one!
[73:26.87]How do I get that?
[73:32.17]How do I pick this up?
[73:34.53]I can't pick this up.
[73:42.18]I need more, you need more alien tech.
[73:43.86]Okay.
[73:50.50]There's another one.
[73:52.61]Alright, it's a big circle, so I've... Obviously, this is not done here yet.
[73:57.93]I need to go somewhere else.
[74:00.75]I guess.
[74:01.41]I feel like that's the thing that's powering that stuff.
[74:04.15]I'm just gonna go back.
[74:07.06]Is this area... Alright, I need to lock this into memory.
[74:08.84]Okay.
[74:15.58]That's that way.
[74:18.66]When are you going to get a rocket launcher?
[74:19.86]I don't think I'm going to get one of those.
[74:22.32]Alright, this is where I came from.
[74:23.51]Is there anything over here?
[74:32.45]No, this is where I was.
[74:38.85]Did I miss something else?
[74:40.21]I guess I could go over here.
[74:50.60]My god, I'm so sorry.
[74:51.68]Holy shit.
[74:52.14]That was that was like the worst thing that ever happened to me That was actually the worst thing that's ever happened to me like my whole life It was it was just a it was like a a weapons case appeared
[75:11.06]So much shit has not happened that I did not think that the weapon, whatever.
[75:15.31]Oh, I got, oh, we're ready to rock and roll.
[75:17.01]It's time.
[75:17.49]Start playing the Gunga.
[75:18.39]Does this have ammo?
[75:29.59]This is the shittiest jump scare I've ever had.
[75:38.98]Whatever.
[75:39.30]Does this have infinite ammo?
[75:46.31]This thing sucks.
[75:52.79]It's like a party horn.
[75:56.67]Oh, I'm out of ammo.
[76:04.58]So what do I do with this?
[76:13.26]So I take this back to there and I start... I can put this... Okay, I know what to do.
[76:23.34]This is gonna go right here.
[76:35.11]Oh!
[76:38.79]Cool.
[76:39.19]There we go.
[76:43.85]Oh.
[77:09.18]Okay.
[77:10.44]So now I go over here and they're all gonna be over here now.
[77:19.59]What?
[77:19.83]Did I supposed to do that?
[77:23.55]Oops.
[77:29.53]Hey!
[77:40.69]A little too high.
[77:52.24]Okay.
[78:04.32]Did one of them fly over here?
[78:06.87]Ooh, look at that.
[78:08.31]Okay, cool.
[78:08.91]I know what to do now.
[78:09.41]Let's get it.
[78:14.65]We picked that one up.
[78:15.87]Stick it over there.
[78:26.54]Go!
[78:27.64]Here we go.
[78:36.58]So where should I put it?
[78:40.74]Space is open up there.
[78:41.58]This is space right here.
[78:46.00]I'm just gonna put it here.
[78:47.18]I think.
[78:50.42]No, I'm not.
[78:52.14]I'm gonna put it where the thing opened.
[78:53.20]Alright.
[79:12.24]And... There's one more.
[79:28.50]It's taking my blood or something.
[79:31.60]It's definitely using my blood to power.
[79:39.89]I got it.
[79:41.19]Aliens are using human blood as oil to power their machines and shit.
[79:45.71]Like, our blood is oil to the aliens, right?
[79:48.17]It has to be.
[79:48.77]Okay, so...
[79:58.07]This is here is another one I gotta get.
[80:00.61]I have to track down another one of those lobe things.
[80:08.88]Where am I going to get this last one?
[80:13.78]Hmm.
[80:40.05]Ah, the French champagne.
[80:41.43]There we go.
[80:53.58]Alright, I should be able to open them all now.
[80:56.68]Get to it.
[81:24.70]See you later.
[81:27.12]See you later.
[81:27.66]They're not gonna fucking harvest us.
[81:47.32]Dude, those are just air conditioners.
[81:49.50]Relax.
[81:52.70]YOU BASTARDS AREN'T GONNA HARVEST US ANYMORE!
[81:54.58]Does he know he's talking to a fuckin', like, air conditioning tube?
[82:07.63]Yo, you bastards!
[82:18.39]They were literally just cleaning stuff.
[82:31.22]Dude you're speaking to a Roomba.
[82:53.03]I overloaded it with blood.
[82:54.29]It's my fault.
[82:55.05]I overloaded it with too much blood.
[82:57.23]What the hell is going on?
[83:37.28]Oh, I'm in a different like world.
[83:42.18]One sec.
[83:44.87]Auto is chilling in here.

[83:55.56]Wait, hold on.

[84:00.52]This is weird.
[84:08.37]Wait actually is birth now.
[84:16.90]Wait what?
[84:25.92]What the hell is going on in this game?
[84:29.26]I give him a sec.
[85:03.90]Okay.
[85:05.88]Hello.
[85:08.01]I have returned.
[85:18.47]Alright, so I've been born.
[85:19.57]Did I rip that out?
[85:27.46]That was the worst time to leave.
[85:28.68]You've...
[85:33.70]Did I- whatever.
[85:36.80]It's fine, I don't care.
[85:40.71]You missed it.
[85:41.57]I don't- whatever.
[85:42.73]I don't- I didn't miss anything!
[85:51.43]You missed lore.
[85:53.22]Vital lore.
[85:55.98]It was a graphic umbilical cord removal.
[85:58.44]Oh, whatever.
[85:58.76]Alright, well this is different.
[86:01.16]This is- I came out of the wall.
[86:05.79]There's other scorns here or whatever is going on.
[86:09.34]Let's go this way.
[86:10.16]Yeah, we're being harvested and it's like... Anybody seen the Matrix?
[86:26.41]What a dumb question.
[86:27.45]I bet you like everybody probably has seen that.
[86:31.73]That's what it kind of feels like.
[86:42.55]Hey, anybody seen the Matrix?
[86:48.95]No, dude.
[86:50.41]You're the only one.
[86:51.15]You're the only one.
[86:53.51]Is that a ship?
[87:04.43]Is this a different planet?
[87:07.19]Did we land on this planet?
[87:12.65]In search of something or contact and we woke up this.
[87:25.32]Is that?
[87:25.72]Is this backwards?
[87:36.51]This is backwards.
[87:37.07]This is backwards.
[87:37.83]Is that backwards?
[88:07.83]I'm wrapping back around here.
[88:08.79]This is where I came from.
[88:11.07]Did I go all the way back?
[88:13.09]I just went in a circle.
[88:16.54]What about this way?
[88:19.26]Did I go this way?
[88:20.04]I didn't look.
[88:23.50]No.
[88:35.89]Hey Jerma, it's Dave from Mensa.
[88:37.29]I want to know that we've rejected your... Oh, it's like a I'm dumb thing.
[88:52.97]Okay, this is really cool though.
[88:54.49]The atmosphere is definitely on point.
[88:57.51]Atmosphere, nine.
[89:14.33]Ah.
[89:16.80]Weird.
[89:21.42]One of these are gonna get up.
[89:39.37]What's my goal here?
[89:40.19]I'm just walking around aimlessly.
[89:53.61]OK, I could go down.
[89:55.33]We're here.
[89:58.83]It's a cute game.
[90:07.30]Alright, let's go.
[90:11.48]I'm ready.
[90:47.57]Sick ships.
[90:49.71]These gravestones.
[90:53.26]Or.
[90:56.08]Alien pods.
[91:09.25]Alien tech.
[91:10.67]Oh, that's right.
[91:12.19]That does what it is, but that looks like.
[91:21.60]I don't... I don't think this... I don't think this one made it.
[91:39.71]I think I gotta go in here.
[91:53.61]Is there a door?
[91:54.19]Like a front door?
[91:54.79]Oh, something over there.
[92:02.74]Is that something glowing?
[92:10.85]Alright, hold on.
[92:14.83]This is the Futurama house.
[92:20.63]That was... Yeah, that's really good.
[92:24.59]That's... Like, how did you... How would you even... That's right, though.
[92:30.64]Like, you... You're completely accurate.
[92:34.68]It just is.
[92:36.80]Alright.
[92:39.85]I think I found a way in.
[92:53.00]This is one of those games where the graphics are so pretty.
[92:55.82]It's such a beautiful game in regards to human tech.
[93:01.04]I'm not talking about alien tech.
[93:02.04]I'm talking about graphics of humanity.
[93:04.53]The human tech on this is great.
[93:07.75]Which makes it way more unsettling.
[93:10.53]It's like too real.
[93:23.04]It's like just all the graphics are good, like really good, so it just makes it worse.
[93:26.48]OK.
[93:33.88]Alright, so I don't know what this is.
[93:39.98]This thing is going to start moving.
[93:42.44]It's going to be all organic shit.
[93:44.44]This is alive.
[93:45.30]OK.
[93:56.61]Oh, fuck.
[94:02.43]Why?
[94:11.95]Oh, God.
[94:31.33]It's a lizard person.
[94:33.65]Alright, do I have to fight that?
[94:35.77]Or hide from it?
[94:54.81]It's just so weird.
[95:13.47]Oh god, okay.
[95:14.89]Um... Honestly, this is what I would do in real life.
[95:25.81]That's what I would do in real life.
[95:30.53]I would get freaked out and fucking run away.
[95:32.65]I did it.
[95:40.95]And all the time, all the while, I'd be running and, like, clapping very, very loudly.
[95:51.04]New, uh, thing for my hand?
[96:03.65]It's saying I can touch it.
[96:16.73]Can I not put my arm in this?
[96:25.96]I guess I can't touch this right now.
[96:30.62]Alright, let me get this into memory here.
[96:32.50]Oh my god, wait, where's the thing?
[96:34.30]Where's the monster?
[96:37.90]Alright, that's Glowing Red Room.
[96:40.57]Remember that.
[96:41.75]Glowing Red Room is that area.
[97:03.95]I don't have whatever this is.
[97:24.35]Interesting.
[97:47.92]Well, I can't do anything over here.
[97:50.16]What do you think this smells like?
[97:54.70]Um... Okay, you know that basement smell?
[98:04.25]That really heavy basement smell.
[98:09.19]I'm going to say like that.
[98:13.00]And.
[98:13.20]I don't know.
[98:16.06]Cheese.
[98:27.52]OK, so where am I supposed to go?
[98:31.79]The shadow I thought was the monster.
[98:37.70]Could I have done something with that?
[98:39.00]I just didn't see it.
[98:39.80]Or is there another way to go?
[98:41.78]It didn't look like I could interact with anything in the red room.
[98:55.01]Oh, you know what?
[98:55.43]No, no, no.
[98:55.89]Basement and something burning.
[99:03.15]That's what it smells like down here.
[99:05.71]Red room.
[99:08.44]Red room.
[99:11.44]I can't touch anything in here.
[99:18.88]Red room.
[99:24.04]Red?
[99:27.82]How do you do it?
[99:28.38]Let me see if I can do it.
[99:31.52]Red.
[99:33.04]Red rum!
[99:33.96]Red rum!
[99:35.16]Red rum!
[99:35.72]Pretty good.
[99:38.02]Pretty good.
[99:39.26]Pretty good!
[99:52.71]Um... There's nothing back here.
[100:08.53]Shit.
[100:09.35]I don't know.
[100:10.41]Maybe go back out to the other... Out to the other area?
[100:19.54]Please tone it down.
[100:20.30]My kid's trying to sleep.
[100:22.78]What headphones is it?
[100:25.20]And why... This is a scary thing to have on the TV.
[100:35.91]I'm gonna go back.
[100:36.57]I'm gonna get out of here.
[100:39.35]You keep walking right by it.
[100:41.05]Dude, don't even tell me I'm doing that.
[101:03.85]No, that's down there.
[101:05.01]Can I go down?
[101:11.19]I can't go down here.
[101:12.05]I keep walking, I keep walking by it.
[101:17.95]I didn't, this is the first skeleton person I've been able to interact with.
[101:23.62]How am I supposed to know I can touch this, how am I supposed to know I can grab this thing?
[101:34.22]You know what, MonkaS, MonkaS chat.
[101:40.61]Oh, God damn it.
[101:41.89]Okay.
[101:44.67]Open up.
[102:15.31]Did I get it?
[102:26.16]What did that do?
[102:29.98]Oh, it's just the wires cut.
[102:31.62]This is not connected to anything.
[102:33.28]Wait, is it?
[102:53.74]Um, oh hey, hey, hey, what the fuck?
[103:24.70]What the hell was that?
[103:25.36]Okay, well this is that.
[103:32.23]This is that.
[103:32.87]This is that.
[103:34.23]So I could have used the elevator.
[103:35.43]Okay.
[103:40.57]This is that.
[103:50.19]The red room.
[103:50.91]I need to come back to the red room.
[103:54.03]I'm imagining I have to open those three things.
[104:01.95]Okay, now we're up.
[104:17.17]Oh, God.
[104:21.89]Little weirdo.
[104:22.66]Alright.
[104:23.46]What's over here?
[104:25.67]Nothing.
[104:53.67]I like this game.
[105:19.37]Whoa, okay.
[105:21.53]Um...
[105:48.16]Look at all this over-engineered alien tech.
[105:55.24]Wait, why am I... I can do this from both sides?
[105:57.04]Wait, hold on.
[105:57.66]I'm confused right now.
[105:58.86]What just happened?
[106:01.72]Wait, what... I'm confused.
[106:03.66]What's going on?
[106:05.50]Just make walkways.
[106:06.76]Yeah, it's true.
[106:07.60]This over-engineered alien bullshit.
[106:10.24]Just make walkways.
[106:11.42]Why does this shit have to exist?
[106:16.90]This is just overdoing everything.
[106:38.59]Uh-oh.
[107:22.42]I'll get it.
[108:05.95]Okay, so there's red room.
[108:08.13]I have a key now, probably for this.
[108:13.08]Whatever this is, yep.
[108:14.44]Oh boy.
[108:24.96]If I said it's my turn to use the Xbox, would you guys think that was funny?
[108:38.71]Oh, I don't have one of those things on.
[108:39.91]Alright.
[108:46.21]So I gotta get one of those arm augments.
[108:51.51]Come back over here.
[108:52.77]Into the middle of this thing.
[108:54.05]Use it.
[108:55.63]So I have this key now.
[108:58.01]I can probably use that.
[108:58.89]Go back down the elevator.
[109:00.05]Use that in the red room.
[109:05.87]What side is this on?
[109:09.50]I don't even know where I came from.
[109:10.64]Over here, right?
[109:12.62]So this is the leftmost pod.
[109:17.62]Right?
[109:34.90]How do I get out of here?
[109:38.03]Is it this one?
[109:39.47]So then it would be the rightmost one.
[109:40.77]Is it this one?
[109:44.75]Oh, shit.
[109:45.33]Okay, hold on.
[109:55.52]Can I make it through that?
[110:10.53]Whoa, what happened there?
[110:12.39]I definitely to turn that off
[110:51.33]Oh, pulled them all.
[110:58.48]One.
[111:04.06]Two.
[111:06.62]Three.
[111:13.50]Got them all.
[111:14.28]Alright, cool.
[111:14.78]So that's a shortcut.
[111:26.97]That didn't work Holy shit
[112:04.54]Huh?
[112:16.93]Alright, that's weird.
[112:17.83]Oh, he's just... Ugh.
[112:33.96]Okay, so... I'm gonna go... out of here.
[112:46.35]What can I do with this?
[112:48.17]I can go through the blades?
[112:49.99]I'll try that.
[112:53.05]I'm eating.
[112:55.21]I mean, I'm playing SCORN.
[112:57.69]But I am very overexposed over here.
[113:00.77]Aren't I?
[113:01.44]Look at them.
[113:02.04]They're bright.
[113:02.88]What's going on here?
[113:05.71]Hold on a second.
[113:09.55]Is that better?
[113:11.40]I'm too bright.
[113:18.64]Lights off.
[113:21.26]Hold on.
[113:22.42]Lights off, but it'll look weird, won't it?
[113:31.81]Is it going to look weird?
[113:38.98]I turned the lights off and somehow this is what happened.
[113:42.84]I don't understand what just happened.
[113:44.74]Why did the webcam just break?
[113:47.00]What?
[113:49.22]Hold on.
[113:49.70]It's because like auto exposure.
[113:55.27]Give me one second.
[113:57.57]Bear with me here, please.
[114:17.39]Why does this look so fucked up now?
[114:20.54]Am I at 60 FPS at least?
[114:29.02]Hold on.
[114:38.72]That's awful.
[114:40.22]2008 score in playthrough.
[114:49.52]I don't know why it's doing this.
[114:54.28]I guess I could do this.
[114:59.23]How did I just... Hold on.
[115:06.25]why is it so frame ratey dude what is it with somebody explain this to me what is it with webcams that they just they go to two FPS if you the like exposure is brought up it's like does this thing only operate on an auto shutter that can never be fucking overrided and you need like six floodlights to make it even look remotely good looking
[115:35.08]Why is it slowing the shutter speed?
[115:36.46]Just put the gamma up, bro.
[115:38.18]Okay, well, this is obviously not going to work, so.
[115:45.23]Let me go back to what this looked like before.
[115:50.67]I mean, I don't get it.
[115:58.27]Computers are stupid.
[116:13.49]What?
[116:13.73]I'm like orange.
[116:15.11]Why am I so orange?
[116:20.32]Alright, that's better.
[116:22.34]That's a little creepier, right?
[116:25.58]There.
[116:25.92]There you go.
[116:26.94]Alright, we're good.
[116:29.18]This is like scary lighting.
[116:32.12]Right?
[116:32.30]OK, let's go.
[116:37.14]You still in the tutorial?
[116:37.98]I'm not in the tutorial, actually.
[116:45.33]Is this the correct size?
[116:47.09]Yeah.
[116:52.63]This thing is so bright now, I can't even see the screen.
[116:59.42]It's like, oh my god.
[117:01.00]I just put like six lights in your face.
[117:19.14]Better.
[117:20.28]Is it shitty framerate?
[117:25.77]Is it still okay?
[117:30.00]We good?
[117:31.44]It's definitely shitty framerate.
[117:40.80]I swear to God.
[117:42.04]I swear to God.
[117:42.54]All these webcam companies have not upgraded the technology since 2006.
[117:47.14]I promise you.
[117:50.42]I don't think they've updated the chips inside of these things since like 2007.
[117:53.72]I don't think so.
[117:58.14]I don't think so.
[118:04.24]Okay.
[118:05.40]So this is where I was.
[118:05.98]I want to go back out to where the fan is.
[118:16.05]Isn't it so weird that ever since I got that old, like, I got this old Logitech webcam.
[118:24.24]I remember using it.
[118:24.96]It was like a C20 or something, right?
[118:28.98]It looks identical to this.
[118:30.41]That was 10 fucking years ago.
[118:36.37]It was literally 10 years ago.
[118:40.21]In fact, it looked better.
[118:41.24]Alright, I'm going to play.
[118:52.07]Alright, so here's this.
[118:53.05]This is a shortcut through the blades.
[118:57.23]Which puts me here.
[119:12.66]Okay, so that is just an easy way to get back to there.
[119:16.48]Right?
[119:17.06]So let's do this.
[119:23.61]Didn't I already do this though?
[119:24.43]Do I have to do this again?
[119:25.98]Wait, what's going on?
[119:30.30]Why am I doing this again?
[119:31.19]Do I have to do this again?
[120:10.11]Stop!
[120:12.20]Got it.
[120:17.60]I got it.
[120:38.10]I mean, you look like you're covered in Cheeto dust.
[120:40.04]I don't know.
[120:41.96]This is a Logitech Brio.
[120:43.79]I think this thing was a hundred fucking dollars.
[120:51.47]This thing was expensive.
[120:55.53]Okay, so I got that.
[121:07.06]This thing is so bad.
[121:08.04]Okay, so I can't go this way.
[121:22.16]So I have a new thing.
[121:23.97]Back to the red room, right?
[121:25.13]That's what I'm going to try to do.
[121:26.55]So let me go back here.
[121:27.21]Yeah, I think I am just going to set up that DSLR.
[121:39.31]Okay, so I got that.
[121:40.13]Cool.
[121:40.47]Let's go over here.
[121:41.79]What's this?
[121:46.58]What is that?
[121:47.12]Can I touch this?
[122:05.26]Ooh, nice.
[122:05.70]Alright, I got the thing now.
[122:15.82]You have an intentional orange filter on.
[122:33.43]Okay, so this is another shortcut.
[122:35.31]So I'm kind of just opening up this whole area.
[122:37.77]Which is good, because now... Do I need to do... No, I did that one already.
[122:44.13]So I gotta go back to red room.
[122:46.39]Right?
[122:47.67]That's the idea.
[122:52.83]Okay, red room.
[122:55.97]Red room was... Around the corner here?
[123:04.72]Where's the red room?
[123:08.66]Where's the red room?
[123:10.90]Down here?
[123:11.22]Dad's over here.
[123:24.18]OK.
[123:25.16]Can I like practice or something?
[123:29.31]Alright, I have a new code.
[123:35.04]Alright, so I gotta get, there's another one.
[123:36.98]There's one more I gotta get.
[123:41.21]Yep, I gotta get one more.
[123:45.59]What is the axe stream?
[123:46.97]You'll see.
[123:50.53]You'll see.
[123:55.32]You'll see.
[123:58.15]Okay, so very obviously I gotta get one more of those, and where the hell is that?
[124:02.08]That's a great question.
[124:03.54]So, I'm missing one code for my, um, power glove, whatever it is.
[124:14.15]Right, okay, so where would that be?
[124:24.63]Probably up where I was.
[124:25.65]Because now I can wait.
[124:27.03]Uh-huh.
[124:28.98]I can go back.
[124:30.32]I have the thing for my arm.
[124:32.54]Let me see if I can backtrack to where I was.
[124:35.64]I got the thing for my arm.
[124:37.76]Which I need that to go up this way.
[124:40.18]I got the thing on my arm.
[124:49.74]right and then I did that and then this is the fan unplug no wait how do I get back to how do I get back to that area the other elevator
[125:21.94]Because I put my hand in this, right?
[125:23.52]So now I can use the thing.
[125:25.40]Where were the fans, dude?
[125:28.36]I just don't fucking remember.
[125:29.48]I just really don't.
[125:44.12]I feel like it was like... No, this is dead end.
[125:52.32]This way.
[125:54.84]That's a red room.
[126:00.43]This is going back.
[126:03.53]This room, which I don't think I'm supposed to be here now.
[126:06.36]How do I?
[126:25.10]I need one more of these fucking things.
[126:34.17]It's not this.
[126:36.29]Give me help.
[126:37.87]Is this the red room elevator?
[126:39.09]Wasn't it just up here?
[126:39.95]Okay.
[126:59.76]It's the tubes.
[127:03.38]Okay, right, so now I'm back up here.
[127:08.98]There's nothing over here.
[127:09.86]Alright, so this is back up this way.
[127:16.70]Where would the other hand-arm thing be?
[127:19.32]Back up through the tubes?
[127:30.53]And then it was to the right, wasn't it?
[127:42.13]It was the left.
[127:44.03]I thought I got spun around.
[127:44.85]Dude, have you been exposed to radiation?
[127:58.93]No, dude, I'm fine.
[128:09.31]Alright.
[128:11.47]So, I did this one.
[128:13.69]I got that one.
[128:16.08]I can go in this thing now.
[128:18.08]I can touch this.
[128:20.56]Right?
[128:21.44]Yeah.
[128:22.24]Alright, let's go.
[128:23.10]Let's go.
[128:23.52]I get it.
[128:23.82]Okay, well... Do it to the one that's blocked.
[128:50.45]OK.
[128:52.13]So then go that way.
[129:01.02]Think that's the only one.
[129:04.50]I think.
[129:06.78]I gotta go that way.
[129:11.92]Over there.
[129:26.22]OK.
[129:28.18]OK.
[129:29.85]I got a feeling it's going to be right here.
[129:31.01]Do you think you have what it takes to be America's next top model?
[129:40.08]No.
[129:43.14]No.
[129:45.84]OK.
[129:46.88]Yes.
[130:09.13]One more.
[130:12.35]Walk it in.
[130:12.89]Where's this one go?
[130:17.07]Down here.
[130:18.23]Wait for the click.
[130:21.80]Okay.
[130:27.62]I get up!
[130:48.62]I know a thing or two.
[130:49.54]Okay, so I got everything.
[130:50.72]It's time to get out of here.
[130:51.52]Time to turn on the red room and see what happens.
[130:57.85]I'm very interested.
[131:00.99]By the way, make sure you get hype for the I'm Going to Dodge a Battle Act stream.
[131:08.87]Coming to you very soon.
[131:10.38]Well, relatively soon.
[131:11.48]Alright, so, um... I want to go over here, right?
[131:18.18]Yeah.
[131:22.71]Back down to the red room.
[131:23.95]Okay.
[131:31.62]Over here.
[131:33.94]There's the red room.
[131:36.01]Back down.
[131:36.51]Alright.
[131:39.43]Let's get the heck out of here.
[131:53.49]Bingo.
[131:53.69]Alright, what happens?
[131:55.21]Took me 40 minutes to do this shit.
[132:12.74]Oh.
[132:14.14]What is that?
[132:14.56]Do I have to rev that up?
[132:16.79]Okay, hold on.
[132:21.49]What is this?
[132:26.98]interesting alright turn it on um that's not gonna work um
[133:26.63]Shit!
[133:27.35]Okay, I'll be alright.
[133:28.55]Stop!
[133:29.25]It's a puzzle!
[133:30.09]You don't beat him instantly!
[133:32.42]Nobody opens this game.
[133:34.53]I'm sorry.
[133:35.15]Nobody does this.
[133:36.25]Everyone that's like, oh my God, he has his brain.
[133:39.39]Just hold on.
[133:40.17]You don't open this and go like.
[133:41.31]No, it takes five minutes to do.
[133:45.42]It takes five minutes.
[134:23.67]See, it takes five.
[134:24.79]It takes a few.
[134:25.49]That's difficult to do that.
[134:27.22]You don't just solve it instantly.
[134:29.08]You don't solve a puzzle like that instantly.
[134:31.26]Nobody does that.
[134:31.80]I bet you half of you guys took 15 minutes to do that.
[134:49.23]I still have that thing attached to me.
[134:55.64]Oh geez.
[135:10.95]Are you going to get up?
[135:16.61]I think this person is going to get up.
[135:22.38]No.
[135:23.26]Alright, I got some device.
[135:25.74]What is the device for?
[135:27.90]Does it open doors?
[135:30.06]Alright, that opens... Logitech Brio yellow color correction using OBS.
[135:43.03]Do I fix this right now?
[135:44.22]Hold on.
[135:44.58]I'm going to fix this right now, apparently.
[135:51.28]I'm into it.
[135:51.92]Let's go.
[136:07.98]Got it.
[136:17.13]Got it, right?
[136:26.67]There it is.
[136:30.72]There it is.
[136:31.98]I'm good.
[136:32.66]Let's go.
[136:36.17]Alright, so this is going to open doors that have the symbol in the top left, which I'm imagining is the one upstairs, right?
[136:43.38]The one that I walk by all the time.
[136:46.06]Wait, is that up and over or is that over here?
[136:50.14]It's over here, right?
[136:51.37]Right here.
[136:51.61]I don't know.
[136:54.95]Okay, so what's in here?
[137:04.53]Seems creepy.
[137:12.39]OK.
[137:15.80]On the other side.
[137:33.92]SCORN.
[137:34.22]I don't think that would add some atmosphere if I after every major kind of area and every puzzle was like music played and you just heard SCORN.
[137:45.99]That'd be kind of cool, I think.
[138:28.58]Oh.
[138:30.42]Okay.
[138:31.36]I can open that door.
[138:32.41]What's over here?
[138:36.77]Weird.
[138:37.13]Alright.
[138:37.85]Does this thing have a sword in its hand?
[138:42.39]Okay, crazy.
[138:42.91]Alright, let's go.
[138:44.54]You doing well?
[138:45.90]I'm just having fun, man.
[138:47.34]Just playing.
[138:49.56]What's your opinion of garlic and onions?
[138:50.94]It pretty much makes any food better.
[138:52.32]That's just a fact.
[139:00.80]Go up.
[139:05.06]Who is disagreeing with that opinion?
[139:07.00]I feel like that's the safest opinion you could possibly have.
[139:11.76]In fact, I don't think there's a safer opinion than saying that garlic is delicious.
[139:15.78]Garlic and onions make things taste good.
[139:17.75]What a... That's not a thing to even disagree with.
[139:26.91]Oh shit, this thing's moving.
[139:34.44]Ugh.
[139:36.86]Gah!
[139:39.14]Get it... Get it off of me.
[139:48.49]Ugh.
[140:07.69]What should I do with it?
[140:08.81]Fill it with blood?
[140:09.65]Okay.
[140:20.96]I'm doing a lot of internal burping this stream, by the way.
[140:25.36]It's gross.
[140:36.44]This is important.
[141:50.46]I'm back.
[141:50.92]Alright.
[141:51.56]Let's go.
[141:58.26]Okay, I got that, whatever that is.
[142:09.67]Is there a filter on it?
[142:10.65]There shouldn't be.
[142:11.09]Okay.
[142:23.12]This is really creepy.
[142:25.04]Alright, I'm going around here.
[142:26.26]Oh my fucking god, give me a break.
[142:32.75]Are you kidding me?
[142:33.41]I've ruined everything.
[142:34.88]Jesus.
[142:35.62]God damn it.
[142:37.10]Fuck!
[142:39.06]Scores.
[142:55.97]That's fucking creepy.
[143:01.98]Come on!
[143:03.54]I'm actually pissed off right now.
[143:08.06]I'm... Truly, I'm not ha- I'm very unhappy.
[143:11.96]I didn't turn the stupid filter off!
[143:15.16]And I see people saying, filter, filter.
[143:16.69]I thought you were talking about the webcam.
[143:18.37]Whatever, let's go.
[143:37.95]Jesus.
[143:41.85]Fuck!
[144:05.67]Alright, open the door.
[144:14.07]Did I beat like the first zone here?
[144:15.89]I haven't seen anything else.
[144:22.24]I don't know.
[144:23.16]We'll find out.
[144:43.25]Okay.
[144:47.40]Interesting.
[144:47.84]Let's go straight ahead.
[144:48.42]Okay, there's a light right here.
[144:57.54]Very cool.
[144:58.14]Oh, Jesus.
[145:06.25]Oh!
[145:06.89]What the fuck?
[145:08.25]Scores.
[145:13.44]That's fucked up.
[145:34.47]Do I get a new power?
[145:39.95]Ooh, this is a new power.
[145:41.33]I can open up doors that have that.
[145:53.31]OK, so let me commit this to memory here, so I have two keys technically.
[145:58.23]I think right.
[146:11.41]What's down here?
[146:27.11]Blood.
[146:29.09]Lots of fucking blood.
[146:30.67]Lots of blood.
[146:31.82]That's a lot of blood.
[146:35.46]I have to be better at fucking acting.
[146:37.52]I have to be way better at acting.
[146:38.72]Hold on, I need to move this.
[146:41.02]I need to be a fucking better actor.
[146:42.08]Okay.
[146:55.48]Alright, so I just walked in a circle.
[146:56.48]Nothing over there.
[146:57.70]So I gotta get down here.
[146:59.62]Wait, what the hell was that?
[147:01.82]Oh!
[147:03.51]Alright, I got that.
[147:05.09]I can probably move this.
[147:08.09]Somehow.
[147:12.71]Was there a door that I walked by?
[147:14.69]Maybe?
[147:17.87]Oh, I can go this way.
[147:18.67]Alright.
[147:20.21]Alright.
[147:36.76]I'm sorry, I can't do it.
[147:43.01]The problem is I can't see where the board is, right?
[147:46.49]So I have to put my arm over here without looking and press the button and it's... I can't.
[147:53.03]I need to... I need to put this somewhere else.
[147:56.81]Somewhere I can like just... Right here.
[148:02.04]I can't fuck this up anymore.
[148:03.38]I gotta stop doing this routine for a few minutes.
[148:09.81]It would make sense if I wasn't laughing.
[148:12.23]Okay, I gotta find that button, and it's right there.
[148:24.38]Right there.
[148:25.39]From here, right there.
[148:26.87]Okay, I got it.
[148:32.47]Can I actually not go down anywhere from here?
[148:46.81]Where am I supposed to go?
[148:47.57]Because this just wraps back around.
[148:52.23]I have a second key.
[148:58.24]I guess over... I could go... I mean, didn't I already do this?
[149:07.08]This is the elevator.
[149:08.96]Can't go back up.
[149:29.16]What's the one place I didn't go?
[149:30.68]This way?
[149:37.99]Like over here?
[149:41.37]Did I not go over here?
[149:42.79]Oh, okay.
[149:43.25]Yeah, yep, yep, yep.
[149:44.15]We're good.
[150:04.55]Do I have to kill this thing?
[150:05.33]Oh, geez.
[150:16.66]Alright, these things are alive.
[150:17.62]Is it alive?
[150:40.79]Fucking scary.
[151:13.82]Hello What the hell why can I not attack?
[151:48.88]That was blue.
[151:51.32]He dead.
[151:54.07]Jeez OK.
[151:57.31]So that's that.
[152:10.14]Why would I do this twice?
[152:14.90]I wouldn't.
[152:31.00]Keep it there.
[152:31.82]Keep it there.
[152:35.52]So now I go up and I can...
[152:39.73]Okay, so I have to move this one.
[152:42.86]Does this one have a thing?
[152:43.66]Okay.
[153:10.51]Now, I just need to get up there.
[153:13.17]Elevator, right?
[153:13.77]And walk through?
[153:14.25]I have to actually start fighting enemies now.
[153:22.46]This is gonna be rough.
[153:31.56]Stop!
[153:32.86]Stop!
[153:38.54]Ow!
[153:38.72]Ow!
[153:50.70]Okay, so you can kill them pretty instantly then.
[154:02.79]Back up here.
[154:03.37]I need to get to that walkway.
[154:07.75]Which is it right here?
[154:11.57]Is the walkway right here?
[154:12.97]I don't know.
[154:13.49]I think so.
[154:16.57]Then I walk this way.
[154:18.19]Yeah, one.
[154:18.67]One.
[154:21.11]and then two but wait a second uh-huh I already got that okay press e to heal are you serious oh my god you're not a liar I thought you lied I don't think is it a full heel

[155:10.30]What?
[155:11.36]This is actually hurting me.
[155:22.27]Okay.
[155:38.06]This thing is still killing me.
[155:40.84]Ugh!
[155:47.85]I'm gonna have to be able to get this thing off, right?
[155:54.45]I'm gonna sit in like a meat grinder machine and this thing's gonna get... a blade's gonna go into its back.
[155:59.27]Okay.
[156:06.17]Oh boy.
[156:08.67]Okay.

[158:01.43]In the head!
[158:01.89]In the head!
[158:02.27]In the head!
[158:02.83]In the head!
[158:03.91]In the head!
[158:07.23]Directly in the head, please.
[158:09.31]Why is it not grabbing?
[158:10.09]How come I can't grab it?
[158:20.76]Why can I not hit him in the head?
[158:43.14]You just got a rare animation?
[158:53.49]Wait, I have to do this all over again.
[158:56.35]Oh, God damn it.
[158:57.09]Alright, I'm not going to fuck it up.
[159:00.78]It's not that... I'm alright.
[159:01.92]I'm alright.
[159:02.28]I'll be fine.
[159:30.34]Eel.
[159:33.90]Okay.
[159:43.59]How do I get out of here?
[159:46.65]I just wanted to leave the globe.
[160:32.71]Pull this.
[160:40.07]Alright, we're good.
[160:54.10]Dermot, your mother's watching the streams.
[160:55.48]Don't waste her time.
[160:59.84]My mother would probably open the stream and go...
[161:02.28]What is he doing?
[161:03.50]What is this?
[161:04.42]And she would leave.
[161:05.35]Dude, what does the bar on the right side even mean?
[161:32.04]Okay.
[161:33.48]I thought it was a stamina bar, but it was hard to even tell where the bar was.
[161:36.63]Alright.
[161:37.29]So you can do it twice.
[161:37.99]Is there a block or anything?
[161:42.00]Can I pull the thing up?
[162:06.41]um okay so that's my health bar wait okay the top row is the amount of heals that I have and the alright so the squares are actual health okay
[162:35.17]I think is much bigger than the other ones.
[162:36.55]OK.
[162:42.88]I don't think I can do anything with that right now.
[162:45.68]Just scary.
[163:04.99]I don't wanna get overwhelmed here.
[163:06.07]This is this is a huge area.
[163:10.53]So let's do this slow and do this right.
[163:13.89]I'm gonna go this way first and I'm gonna go up.
[163:18.07]I'm gonna get so fucking lost here.
[163:20.62]I'm gonna get so lost.
[163:37.99]There's going to be a big ball there.
[163:39.69]Okay, so there's going to be a huge ball that I have to get on that.
[163:53.45]That's a good place to start.
[163:59.66]Okay.
[164:01.80]So, let me go over there.
[164:05.08]I think.
[164:08.85]Sure.
[164:12.81]Sure, yeah.
[164:14.19]It sounds right.
[164:16.35]Yeah.
[164:22.90]The track here.
[164:23.58]Alright, so this is a. Port a poor teleport ball.
[164:31.06]What's on the other side?
[164:31.70]OK, one of these.
[164:40.50]Oh no, I thought that was a machine.
[164:41.66]No, it's not.
[164:42.08]Alright, there's nothing over here.
[164:42.84]Alright, let's go.
[164:53.17]Somebody just said, what's the point?
[164:57.73]I don't know of why I'm playing this because it's Halloween time.
[165:02.79]What's the point?
[165:09.30]Oh, wait a minute.
[165:16.04]It's new.
[165:16.54]It just came out.
[165:19.50]This was a pretty hyped up game from what I remember.
[165:22.56]Didn't we watch the E3 trailer or something, right?
[165:26.13]Alright, where am I?
[165:35.25]We did?
[165:35.59]I think we did, yeah.
[165:55.43]Shit.
[165:57.23]Okay.
[166:00.76]Is that the thing I needed to grab?
[166:02.56]Oh, please.
[166:04.94]Please don't.
[166:07.58]Oh!
[166:31.64]SCORN Now there's more to do I think I have to bring it all the way up
[167:17.21]So this can hold two charges, and each charge is four health.
[167:21.07]A total of eight health.
[167:23.33]I think.
[167:28.77]Alright, what else is here?
[167:30.79]Anything interesting to do still?
[167:33.47]Anything at all?
[167:56.96]there's probably a few of them oh you dead alright it's dead
[168:31.85]Stop get- I can't move.
[168:59.33]What's up with your face today?
[169:00.33]I don't know.
[169:09.42]Oh.
[169:09.94]Got you.
[169:28.87]Do I do anything with this or it's just annoying in a way?
[169:31.59]Hey!
[169:53.95]Why does he only read mean messages?
[169:58.67]No, I've read some nice ones.
[170:17.58]Okay.
[170:19.89]Alright, so now I'll bring this all the way up.
[170:21.91]And then I can go pick it up.
[170:32.61]This is loud.
[170:33.47]I gotta turn it down.
[170:34.89]Alright, so that's all the way up there now.
[170:44.34]Two?
[171:04.04]I don't have invincibility when I'm doing that to someone?
[171:06.30]Okay.
[171:06.60]Shoot!
[171:07.75]That's okay.
[171:35.74]We're good.
[171:36.94]It's all the way up.
[171:38.50]I think I just need to grab it with the big claw hand, right?
[171:42.11]I think that's what I have to do.
[171:46.95]I'm out of... No, I have a little bit more.
[171:50.47]I'll get to full health.
[172:01.10]Snore?
[172:03.56]Don't even...
[172:05.85]Don't, don't even, don't even, don't even start.
[172:12.33]Don't even.
[172:12.75]Okay, now, uh, what do I do now?
[172:25.26]I guess I can, I don't know.
[172:29.62]I'm gonna activate this.
[172:38.22]Oh, it's giving me an area to go.
[172:45.81]I'm going to go that way just to see what... Oh, I can't.
[172:48.37]Wait.
[172:52.33]What's it doing?
[173:02.08]It's just moving on its own.
[173:03.02]Okay.
[173:04.70]Okay.
[173:09.50]This shit's moving on its own.
[173:12.16]So now I'm imagining I get in and then go down or get in and just run across.
[173:31.72]I think we're going to see the end of this arc here.
[173:41.51]No.
[173:49.71]What is the end of that arc?
[173:54.92]I definitely get it ripped off of me, right?
[173:56.56]I have to.
[173:58.26]Yeah, right there.
[174:02.34]I'm going to sit in this.
[174:03.06]I'm going to sit in this and it's going to take it off of me.
[174:05.24]Watch this.
[174:10.69]What the fuck is this?
[174:18.02]What am I looking at?
[174:23.26]I don't know what that does.
[174:25.56]That's cool.
[174:27.54]Alright, this thing's coming off.
[174:42.81]ammo oh I have alright cool so weird alright so this thing's loaded probably gonna be using it right now to shoot something
[175:16.60]Yep.
[175:18.32]Stop.
[175:28.31]Score.
[175:37.73]Cool.
[175:39.59]Now this looks interesting over here.
[175:57.75]Oh.
[176:32.89]Fine.
[176:36.29]That doesn't do it?
[176:36.73]That's not it?
[176:39.98]How's that not it?
[176:46.34]How am I supposed to get that to go?
[176:48.42]There's not enough pieces.
[177:00.54]There's not enough pieces to do this.
[177:22.11]Do I need another piece or something?
[177:23.37]I don't get it.
[177:29.58]I had all three of them lit up.
[177:30.52]Alright, the only time I can light this one up is if it's touching the one on the right side here.
[177:40.71]That's the only time the middle one lights up.
[177:42.91]No?
[177:47.24]So what is making it do that?
[178:22.30]I got it.
[178:23.96]That was weird.
[178:27.38]Score.
[178:32.60]Alright, this is goes in the elevator upstairs.
[178:43.11]Oh no, I gotta do this again.
[178:44.23]I gotta do that again.
[178:48.43]It's gonna be harder next time, please.
[178:51.89]Um, okay.
[178:54.83]I'm going... Let's go down.
[179:06.18]So I need to put the... You know what I'm saying?
[179:10.42]I gotta put the thing in to go down another level?
[179:12.76]Or should I just go down with it right now?
[179:19.86]Should I go and put the thing in?
[179:25.62]Or should I just go down to that second level?
[179:28.36]Get more ammo.
[179:38.11]I think this is only one use.
[179:41.51]Yeah, I can't get any more.
[179:42.25]I'm just going to try going down.
[179:53.56]How come these aliens build their spaceship with a bunch of annoying puzzles?
[180:00.39]Well, think about it.
[180:01.63]If an alien landed here, and you told them to get in a car, and go drive on, go anywhere on like a highway, they'd be like, what the fuck is all this?
[180:15.17]What's this weird system of lines that you have to go on with this thing?
[180:19.09]They'd say the same shit.
[180:22.55]Our highway systems would confuse the fuck out of an alien.
[180:26.61]So, I mean, is this the equivalent?
[180:28.79]Probably.
[180:36.76]I need that.
[180:37.14]There it is.
[180:38.04]So what should I put in the middle one?
[180:52.91]Puzzle complete.
[181:06.66]Is he okay?
[181:09.20]Better than ever.
[181:17.84]Now we go down.
[181:20.50]Do that other puzzle.
[181:24.28]Over here?
[181:25.92]Very cool.
[181:28.00]Very cool.
[181:35.30]Hey!
[181:35.90]Dude, you are making me angry.
[181:58.97]How do I get more weapons?
[182:00.69]Can I do it?
[182:01.13]I can't.
[182:01.46]Where's my other gun?
[182:02.28]Uh-oh, this is bad.
[182:04.84]I don't know.
[182:12.26]I can't reload.
[182:12.74]There's nothing in the gun.
[182:23.57]Do I even need to kill any of this shit?
[182:25.35]Honestly.
[182:25.55]Honestly.
[182:30.28]Press 1.
[182:40.57]Oh.
[182:41.91]Oh my god.
[182:42.35]Okay.
[182:42.69]I was doing mouse scroll.
[182:43.59]I was trying to scroll for new weapons, but it's just okay.
[182:46.45]I got it.
[182:46.69]Cool.
[182:47.65]Cool.
[182:48.51]That's weird.
[182:49.19]He's going to mouth.
[183:03.62]That's a weird request.
[183:04.90]Dude, can you do Alex Jones stuck in the SCORN world?
[183:13.14]Somebody is next to me right now.
[183:29.72]Let me figure this out first because this is going to take me a little bit.
[183:38.38]Alright, I can turn this one.
[183:40.22]Like that.
[183:51.82]Oh, fuck.
[183:52.85]The whole thing has to be done.
[183:53.89]Okay.
[184:15.04]no no no no no no
[184:44.53]Okay, hold on.
[184:49.15]You gotta just get them all massed up.
[185:34.55]How do I get them to turn together?
[185:38.04]Oh, that's how.
[185:38.82]Alright, hold on.
[185:54.65]I gotta turn this how many times?
[185:55.69]Like two more times?
[186:03.26]one two three four that okay so now oh
[186:36.14]I'm so goddamn close, man.
[186:39.39]So I need to keep this, uh... Yeah!
[186:48.73]Okay, cool.
[187:09.36]Now I go.
[187:17.54]Go back, put this in and go all the way down.
[187:27.40]This guy supposed to dodge a battleaxe?
[187:31.41]A puzzle is a video game puzzle is not even close to comparing me dodging a battleaxe.
[187:39.09]They're two completely different worlds.
[187:45.42]Oh, whatever.
[187:47.00]Just run.
[187:51.08]It's basically the same thing.
[187:52.23]No, it's not.
[187:56.71]It's not even close.
[188:07.79]Are you going to practice for the Battle Act stream?
[188:12.13]Practice what?
[188:15.23]You think I need practice?
[188:19.05]I don't think you know who the fuck you're talking to.
[188:23.44]I'm sorry.
[188:23.84]I'm sorry.
[188:24.50]Hold on.
[188:25.52]I'm sorry.
[188:25.88]That was... Let me pull it off a little.
[188:45.82]who I am?
[188:46.36]Do you have any idea who I am?
[188:50.48]Do you know who you're talking to?
[188:52.70]You think I can't dodge a battle axe?
[188:54.62]Oh, okay.
[188:56.52]Sorry, I'm gonna cool off.
[188:59.29]And I forget where I'm going.
[189:05.65]I knew I had to go up to go to that device to put the third plug in.
[189:10.83]Um, I forget where that is.
[189:22.38]Oh, you have any idea who you're talking to?
[189:31.16]I need... Where is this machine thing?
[189:33.55]It's up here somewhere.
[189:34.29]Over there?
[189:34.63]It's across the way, right?
[189:48.42]Did I go?
[189:48.84]Did I run by it?
[189:49.48]I mean, I'm sorry.
[189:50.92]I'm looking at chat.
[189:51.53]People are telling me to do an Alex Jones impression.
[189:53.77]I'm trying to pay attention to this fucking puzzle game.
[189:57.11]Okay, here it is.
[190:13.75]This is not it.
[190:15.43]Where is this thing?
[190:16.99]It's right there.
[190:17.55]Jesus.
[190:27.83]How do I get over there?
[190:37.22]Wait, what?
[190:39.22]How the fuck do I get over there?
[190:45.27]Other way?
[190:46.05]Oh god, come on.
[190:51.49]You were just there?
[190:56.66]Dude, it's right here.
[190:58.66]How do I get over there?
[191:05.10]Oh my god, I was already over there.
[191:06.73]Alright.
[191:06.99]Alright, no, start doing- I'm not doing Alex Jones ever again.
[191:13.95]No, I'm not doing Alex Jones ever again.
[191:21.80]In fact, yeah, you're gonna get punished with a Stewie Griffin impression.
[191:28.08]That's what you get.
[191:29.56]You're gonna get punished with a Stewie Griffin.
[191:31.16]Here it comes.
[191:32.88]Yep.
[191:40.69]I say, Brian.
[191:42.25]What?
[192:06.44]and we go down all the way most streamers don't punish their viewers
[192:31.83]I'm, I'm punishing you with a Stewie Griffin voice.
[192:37.21]I think, I think it's going to be okay.
[192:45.18]Alright.
[192:46.34]Everything has been done.
[192:50.56]Now I have to grab the ball.
[192:57.48]What's down here?
[192:58.04]Nothing.
[193:01.97]I have complete, I have, uh... Wait.
[193:07.71]Did I explore down here completely?
[193:09.05]I think I did, right?
[193:18.39]Is there anything else to do down here?
[193:22.83]I mean, I could just turn this on.
[193:24.19]Will this get the thing I need?
[193:25.29]Alright, we'll get it.
[193:37.31]Thank you.
[194:16.03]Okay, so what did that do?
[194:17.05]Can I get in?
[194:25.88]Oh, now I can grab this and take it over here.
[194:29.40]Okay.
[194:40.04]Uh... Alright.
[194:43.70]Um... Now what?
[194:58.51]I think there's another ball to grab here.
[195:03.11]I think.
[195:06.99]You're doing great?
[195:07.70]Oh, thanks.
[195:07.98]It's funny when he starts doing a bit.
[195:13.50]And you can tell when he gets completely distracted from whatever he's doing in the game.
[195:18.46]Yes.
[195:19.23]That happens very frequently.
[195:22.87]Because my problem is...
[195:25.58]I don't stop moving, right?
[195:28.72]I don't stop moving.
[195:30.85]Usually when I start talking, I look in a chat.
[195:32.77]I'm just walking, right?
[195:34.39]Just walking straight and turning corners and stuff.
[195:37.23]So I disconnect from the game when I'm talking to you, but I'm still moving.
[195:41.67]So I need to just take my hands off the keyboard when I start to talk.
[195:45.27]And then, oh, I'm still in the same spot.
[195:46.71]Okay, I can kind of implant back in.
[195:50.81]Alright, so what does this do?
[196:04.72]Nothing.
[196:08.38]OK.
[196:15.91]Should I just go in here?
[196:17.45]Ball ball ball GG GG.
[196:28.26]There's no ball.
[196:37.08]What do you mean GG?
[196:51.36]Okay.
[197:09.65]Now I'm going to go down.
[197:39.64]And then I'm going to... It's going to grab it out of this... Hand it off, right?
[197:44.90]Can I just hand it off?
[197:49.61]Can I drop this here?
[197:52.05]Oh, alright.
[197:55.25]Nice.
[197:55.61]Very nice.
[197:56.09]So now we've got... Two balls over here.
[198:03.00]Looks good.
[198:06.52]Alright, I'm going to get in this one.
[198:15.81]But not yet.
[198:18.69]What is the point of this one?
[198:21.11]I guess I could bring it.
[198:23.69]Where am I going to bring this?
[198:35.48]Okay.
[198:38.12]I guess that makes sense.
[198:39.00]And then I go in that?
[198:41.48]Alright.
[198:44.10]Um.
[198:47.40]Let me just check back here because I don't want to miss anything.
[198:50.49]Did I go down here yet?
[198:51.47]I don't think I did.
[198:53.63]There's an alien down here.
[198:54.49]Of course I didn't.
[198:57.63]Oh, this thing's dead.
[199:00.57]Did I go down here?
[199:06.61]Cool.
[199:11.04]Did I come down here?
[199:28.54]Oh, I did.
[199:29.32]Yeah, this is where that thing was crawling around over here.
[199:31.84]Alright, I'm going back up.
[199:35.69]I've been down here.
[199:57.72]I just dodged so much.
[200:06.72]Why am I even fighting you?
[200:16.51]What are you, what are you doing?
[200:24.73]Get it off.
[200:28.66]So I'm going to go in that ball.
[200:40.27]I think that completes this section.
[200:56.74]Interesting.
[201:00.80]I need ammo.
[201:07.24]Again with this monster.
[201:24.79]Wait, that's hurting me every time.
[201:27.23]Really?
[201:28.51]Can that thing actually kill you and just softlock you in the game?
[201:34.32]I'm assuming yes.
[201:47.62]Oh, thank god.
[201:48.19]The full flip.
[202:11.66]Alright, another one of these.
[202:13.72]Which I probably have to drop all of them.
[202:16.02]Okay, what the fuck is that?
[202:19.12]Can I not go this way?
[202:28.13]Okay, I can't go that way.
[202:30.47]So what?
[202:47.66]Okay, I've already been here.
[202:48.54]Shit.
[202:52.13]Alright, how do I get down there?
[203:07.80]Can't go that way.
[203:08.34]Do I have to do something with this?
[203:16.10]This game reminds me of seafood.
[203:22.65]Weird.
[203:22.97]Um, I'm going to go this way and down.
[203:36.40]Whatever.
[203:36.68]Not even going to give you a chance.
[204:12.80]Oh, I can't move.
[204:15.36]Wait, should I stay in here?
[204:21.74]I feel like I'm OK.
[204:24.02]It doesn't move.
[204:45.51]These guys probably jump off and follow you around.
[204:48.84]I'm going to kill them every time I see them.
[205:08.07]Yeah, what's that?
[205:24.24]This is gonna be such a huge pain in the ass, I can already tell.
[205:26.39]I gotta move all these... When I move one of these gates, another gate closes in a different place in the... Scores.
[206:03.00]Shit.
[206:07.62]Oh, dude, it's a new SCORN-like game.
[206:09.44]That was a good one.
[206:11.98]How far back am I?
[206:16.62]SCORN-like game.
[206:20.20]I'm about that far back, right?
[206:24.44]No.
[206:26.84]No, not really at all.
[206:27.62]Alright, let's keep going.
[206:34.12]Shut up.
[206:36.85]I don't want to shoot you, but I'm... Oh my god, the little shit enemy killed me.
[206:51.34]How many takes of this did I do?
[206:56.02]SCORN.
[206:57.60]SCORN.
[206:59.72]SCORN.
[207:00.74]SCORN.
[207:01.91]That one doesn't have any effects on it at all.
[207:05.87]That was just a guy.
[207:07.19]Scorned.
[207:11.69]That would probably be annoying after a while.
[207:23.27]I think I have... No, I don't.
[207:25.04]Just kill it.
[207:33.82]It's not annoying.
[207:35.62]Yes, it is.
[207:36.44]I know it is.
[207:40.31]Alright, now let's get ready.
[207:52.59]This thing falls.
[207:53.75]Oh, look out.
[207:54.39]Okay, we're good.
[207:55.75]It doesn't go anywhere.
[207:57.07]This is where the enemy is.
[207:58.01]I got a full clip.
[208:00.78]Let's go.
[208:08.73]Okay, turn this on.
[208:09.65]I need health bad.
[208:11.03]Let me check over here first.
[208:15.09]It's probably health or something, right?
[208:23.94]Is there really nothing over here?
[208:30.04]Dude, what is that sound?
[208:34.81]No, there's nothing here.
[208:46.03]Okay, let's try this again.
[208:47.53]Hopefully I don't die because I'm going to start over.
[208:54.75]Very saturated, yeah.
[209:00.50]Have you considered reloading?
[209:03.20]I have a full magazine.
[209:04.38]Alright, here we go.
[209:13.34]Here comes... Alright, let's go.
[209:21.14]Where's he?
[209:22.30]There, alright.
[209:26.00]Whoa!
[209:28.58]Cut off.
[209:29.29]Cut off, I'm fine.
[209:46.08]Score.
[209:54.11]I have to do that whole thing again.
[209:55.65]How am I gonna?
[210:02.13]Nice indie filter.
[210:03.56]I need health.
[210:07.70]I don't have any health potions or anything.
[210:14.32]If I get hit once, I'm dead.
[210:21.84]Um, alright.
[210:23.53]I just have to, I can't run in the hallway.
[210:24.93]He'll kill me if I run down the hall.
[210:35.15]Go, go, go, go.
[210:36.05]I know where I'm going.
[210:36.77]Come on.
[210:54.95]Okay.
[210:57.25]Just watch this hall.
[210:58.35]Okay, so I'm gonna just do this and then run away.
[211:01.17]Because I will just... I'm gonna just run him around this circle.
[211:09.92]He has to follow the same pathing rules that I do.
[211:13.04]There he is.
[211:13.52]Alright.
[211:20.40]Okay.
[211:40.16]Get out of this tunnel!
[212:06.26]thought I could stagger him enough times don't just run don't try to kill it really but yeah
[212:32.44]Don't be greedy.
[212:34.02]I was under the impression that if I shot it in the head, it moves around and I can shoot it like four or five times.
[212:39.98]It was my mistake.
[212:44.70]Okay.
[212:44.90]Let's try this again.
[212:46.42]Look, I could die in one hit anyway.
[212:52.95]I'm seriously... I'm... I'm just rushing now to get through this.
[213:26.20]Yeah, I know.
[213:26.80]Come on.
[213:28.84]Come on.
[213:29.34]Yeah, whatever.
[213:29.96]Okay, I'm going to just run away.
[213:47.78]I'm not gonna fight.
[213:48.50]I'm gonna just run.
[213:49.14]I'm not gonna waste ammo.
[213:51.52]I'm not gonna waste an entire magazine on this shit.
[213:55.60]Where is the path I need to take?
[213:58.84]Through here and then I wonder if I can just wrap around.
[214:10.46]Just pretend every enemy is a battleaxe.
[214:12.18]Well, I'm not actually moving to get out of the way.
[214:18.90]Alright.
[214:20.80]How do I get out of here?
[214:23.57]What's the correct way to go?
[214:26.31]I think I have to go that way.
[214:27.87]Alright, let's run you around.
[214:28.83]Yeah, I actually have to go where he came from.
[214:34.62]Alright, that was much easier than... He's not still behind me, right?
[214:51.43]Ah!
[214:51.73]Let's do something!
[214:52.51]Move!
[214:52.69]Move!
[214:56.19]Is that gonna get up?
[215:31.52]Thank you.
[216:24.70]Thank God.
[216:40.82]Do I have this?
[216:41.65]I don't.
[216:42.39]I need the other piece.
[216:43.49]Where is it?
[216:53.17]Don't, don't come at me, please.
[216:55.15]Don't.
[217:03.08]This is DOOM 3, but it's awesome.
[217:09.02]I mean, it's really, really cool.
[217:11.45]The atmosphere of the game alone is worth playing, I think.
[217:16.49]I don't know, honestly, much else to say besides that.
[217:22.69]But I mean, that's carrying the whole game for me right now.
[217:25.19]It's like how weird and interesting this place is.
[217:27.76]Alright, I'm going to die in one hit down there.
[217:33.14]I'm going to shoot.
[217:33.64]I'm going to shoot this guy.
[217:43.25]He hates it.
[217:43.75]He loves it.
[217:45.85]I have to give my full assessment.
[217:56.76]Where are you?
[217:57.28]You're just walking around.
[217:57.90]Are you going to get up?
[218:09.43]I die in one hit, so...
[218:30.25]Okay, this way.
[218:39.14]Ah!
[218:52.68]Dude, if I would've just let you in.
[219:04.44]I would have just let this thing in.
[219:08.24]Oh, God.
[219:15.19]Oh, wait.
[219:15.77]Oh, alright.
[219:16.93]Thank goodness.
[219:19.33]Oh, thank goodness.
[219:20.71]Okay, we're good.
[219:22.55]Is this health?
[219:26.09]What is this?
[219:27.01]Oh, it's the key.
[219:27.99]Is this health?
[219:30.01]This is ammo.
[219:31.69]I need... Oh, shit.
[219:32.58]Shit.
[219:34.57]Can I get more?
[219:35.17]Alright, well, I guess I'll just fill the whole thing.
[219:41.65]This should be enough for another few, at least.
[219:47.08]Okay, that's good.
[219:53.86]Let me get the key, and then I have to go back through that.
[219:58.44]Oh, that's going to be annoying.
[219:59.38]Okay.
[220:02.64]How do I get back there?
[220:06.43]This is a disaster.
[220:09.19]I'm just going to run.
[220:34.45]Don't go down there.
[220:54.50]Okay.
[220:56.14]And then it's this way, and then... Up, I think?
[221:02.84]I'm kind of lost.
[221:03.68]I think it's this way and up.
[221:06.08]To get to that door.
[221:12.87]He's not going to follow me all the way over here, right?
[221:25.92]I don't, I don't remember.
[221:28.94]It's up.
[221:29.70]That's all I remember is up.
[221:33.61]I think I have to plug in this thing into, yeah, I think.
[221:36.77]Where are you going?
[221:39.44]I don't, I'm trying to backtrack back to where that door was.
[221:42.32]I think it's this way.
[221:45.52]I hope I'm right.
[221:55.17]This is wrong.
[222:00.61]This is too far back.
[222:01.55]Go to the elevator.
[222:12.65]That was right.
[222:13.35]No, no, no, that is right.
[222:15.97]Wait, what?
[222:18.13]You scorned too much, dude.
[222:22.82]It is right.
[222:23.36]Is the dev in chat?
[222:25.16]Is it right?
[222:25.64]Can the dev tell me if it's right?
[222:32.52]Dude, you scorned too much.
[222:45.33]Oh.
[222:46.51]I went too far.
[222:47.11]Did I go?
[222:47.67]Help.
[222:48.19]I actually want help.
[222:49.31]Backseat me, please.
[223:02.89]It's too far back.
[223:06.58]Okay.
[223:10.32]Too far back.
[223:58.78]Are we doing good?
[224:00.54]Yes.
[224:06.65]My score no meter is low.
[224:10.67]I can help you out there in a minute.
[224:18.82]Oh thank goodness.
[224:21.22]I'm going to leave it at that.
[224:21.98]Full ammo.
[224:26.26]Pretty much full health.
[224:29.85]And on to the next area.
[224:48.99]Well, looks like I am going to feel again.
[224:53.59]How's the audio?
[224:54.49]Are we good?
[224:54.85]Are the levels good today?

[226:48.95]I don't know.
[226:52.73]Okay.

[231:01.14]I'm good, I'm good.
[231:01.56]Is that a map?
[231:07.49]It's like where I know is a puzzle.
[231:14.63]Okay, I'm going back up.
[231:28.14]I'm fine.
[231:46.32]Am I going the right way?

[232:27.76]That thing is terrifying.
[232:29.04]Alright.
[232:29.86]What a weird thing.
[232:30.96]I hope I'm going the right way.
[232:37.95]Is this right?
[232:48.33]I don't know.

[234:12.26]I'll take one.
[234:15.62]OK, so now I can go down.
[234:18.47]Oh my goodness, they're everywhere.
[234:42.93]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[234:54.63]Die already.
[234:55.19]Alright, we're good.
[234:58.32]I need four dots to get in here.
[235:05.28]This game looks so cool.
[235:06.72]It really does.
[235:07.26]Alright, I...
[235:14.25]It's good, it's very good.
[235:19.20]But I don't know how good.
[235:21.90]Does that make any sense?
[235:26.28]So now I gotta get back down.
[235:33.42]Down here.
[235:33.78]I think I have to walk just straight down, right?
[235:46.26]Down here.
[235:52.96]Geez.
[236:00.39]Alright.
[236:04.81]Now what?
[236:10.05]Dude, now what?
[236:13.97]What am I like turn?
[236:14.81]Am I turning into something?
[236:18.56]Alright, here comes the puzzle.
[236:36.32]It's impossible.
[236:49.36]This is not possible.
[236:51.08]Okay.
[236:52.26]Oh.
[237:41.11]I mean, this is where I came from.
[237:58.84]Isn't it?
[238:03.48]Missed the hallway back here.
[238:06.60]Did I?
[238:10.49]I have to go up.
[238:16.65]Is the puzzle room down here in the bottom layer?
[238:18.67]You mean like here?
[238:26.61]Uhm.
[238:28.55]I didn't go over here.
[238:29.25]Shit.
[238:43.00]Right, well, I can't go that way.
[238:47.59]Did I go both directions here?
[238:50.55]Can't go over there.
[238:51.23]Did I go this way?
[238:57.19]Yeah, I can't go over this way.
[238:58.34]Alright, um... I don't get it.
[239:07.30]I can't do that maze puzzle?
[239:11.71]I'm gonna go down.
[239:20.81]Like down here.
[239:21.49]I love one of those.
[239:30.80]It's a new weapon.
[239:38.32]What is this?
[239:49.55]This is like a shotgun.
[239:52.53]Cool.
[239:57.12]Oh, the middle ones are shotgun.
[239:58.74]The outer ones are pistol.
[240:01.88]So I must have all the weapons in the game now, right?
[240:04.34]Yeah, I have to.
[240:06.00]I have all the weapons in the game.
[240:09.18]This is the... I don't want to use this frequently.
[240:11.72]Although, let me reload it.
[240:21.61]Three shots.
[240:30.68]Okay.
[240:32.74]Good to go.
[240:34.46]Good to go.
[240:35.94]Let's go this way.
[240:38.48]Can't go that way, so let's go over here.
[240:45.65]Well, I'm going to use it.
[240:46.77]Because if there's a time to use it, it's right now.
[240:53.38]Two shots to kill the big guys.
[240:55.76]You got it.
[240:56.14]Okay, what's this?
[241:19.70]Oh shit, okay.
[241:27.43]Where are you?
[241:44.82]Where are you?
[241:45.42]Okay.
[241:51.08]We're good.
[242:21.94]I'm moving so slow.
[242:23.46]Holy shit.
[242:24.22]I'm moving one mile per hour when I reload.
[242:49.32]You made me cry today.
[242:50.38]I'm sorry.
[242:51.64]Whatever.
[242:52.40]I didn't do anything.
[242:52.98]Okay.
[242:59.22]What about the time that you made me cry today?
[243:05.22]Jeremy, you're stupid.
[243:06.16]You didn't do the puzzle fast enough.
[243:07.36]Stupid.
[243:07.80]Oh, yes.
[243:30.23]So good luck trying to remember where the hell all these were.
[243:33.87]I know where this one is.
[243:34.63]It's right here.
[243:41.97]It looks like I only got two more bubbles.
[243:48.79]I'll close mine at the end of the game.
[243:50.45]The last third or something.
[243:52.35]Two more bubbles can fit and I have all the weapons.
[244:02.24]You're close to bubbles.
[244:08.38]I think life.
[244:13.32]Oh, it's a shortcut back.
[244:14.24]Alright, so where were those two things?
[244:19.77]Already got that.
[244:20.37]OK, looking for the door of the bubble doors.
[244:35.10]Wasn't there a bubble door up here?
[244:36.02]I feel like there is, right?
[244:39.58]No.
[244:45.71]Where's the bubble door?
[244:50.93]This way.
[244:54.27]Yep.
[245:05.73]I'm going in.
[245:06.83]Alright.
[245:09.71]Can I do this one?
[245:36.81]No.
[245:37.55]Oh, that's the... I gotta get all three of them up there.
[245:42.51]I get it.
[245:43.13]Alright, so how do I go?
[245:44.41]I gotta go to the other bubble door and come down.
[245:46.27]Alright, I know.
[245:47.15]I know.
[245:47.43]I'm going.
[245:47.77]Here we go.
[245:51.07]There's another bubble door.
[245:55.16]But where is that bubble door?
[245:56.34]Is it straight down?
[246:06.43]It's all the way over here, right?
[246:08.89]Is it on this floor?
[246:17.09]Oh, what?
[246:21.61]Can you please say bubble door 10 times fast?
[246:24.51]Bubble door, bubble door, bubble door, bubble door, bubble door.
[246:27.33]Hold on.
[246:28.51]Bubble door, bubble door.
[246:31.25]Bubble door, bubble door, bubble door, bubble door, bubble door, bubble door, bubble door.
[246:34.56]I could do it a few times.
[246:36.58]Bubble door, bubble door, bubble door, bubble door, bubble door, bubble door, bubble door, bubble door.
[246:42.76]There are a few handful times.
[246:47.24]It's not this way.
[246:47.82]Is it all the way up or down?
[246:49.09]I don't remember.
[246:57.57]This way.
[247:01.43]I think it's over here.
[247:13.64]It's down, down, down, down, down, down.
[247:24.40]Down.
[247:25.42]Far left.
[247:33.79]Yeah, but I mean I far left from where?
[247:39.65]Like from where I'm standing right now this way like this way left.
[247:51.15]Because there's nothing here.
[247:51.93]I swear to God, I saw it.
[247:54.97]I gotta get around there.
[248:02.38]I have to keep going down, down, down, down, down.
[248:07.32]Um, okay.
[248:08.36]How do I get down from here?
[248:09.60]How do I get down from here?
[248:17.54]Can I go down from... I think I can get down here, right?
[248:21.00]Can I get there from here?
[248:27.67]No, I can't get there from here.
[248:28.59]This is all blocked off.
[248:30.19]Um... There's nothing this way.
[248:41.44]Ceiling?
[248:44.94]Uh...
[248:50.71]Down around here.
[248:55.66]It's not this way, right?
[248:58.28]Yeah, it's screaming me if I'm going too far at the wrong direction.
[249:01.54]I genuinely don't fucking know where I'm going.
[249:13.17]Wrong.
[249:18.52]Is it though?
[249:21.88]It is, isn't it?
[249:22.66]Yeah.
[249:32.33]I wish I had like a fucking compass.
[249:33.59]Alright, so from here...
[249:52.76]I have to be down, you're saying.
[249:56.74]How do I get all the way down here?
[249:58.72]Can I go this way?
[250:03.59]And then backwards.
[250:05.83]No?
[250:09.61]And then down this way.
[250:11.05]And then around and backwards.
[250:17.18]Oh, there it is.
[250:17.70]Okay.
[250:20.70]Scored!
[250:25.29]I was going to press it, but I didn't.
[250:51.03]Oh, hey.
[250:56.73]Wasn't there a huge guy over here?
[250:59.41]I distinctly remember a huge guy.
[251:01.07]Maybe it's the other side.
[251:14.58]That's like a shortcut back.
[251:16.86]Alright, so what do I do now?
[251:25.16]Yep.
[251:25.66]Alright, I have to open that.
[251:28.59]Okay, shotgun please.
[251:30.33]Jeez.
[251:46.86]Candy corn?
[251:51.22]If candy corn had 30% less flavor, I'd like it.
[251:56.60]Alright, I got health.
[251:58.26]I'm out of ammo, though.
[251:59.50]That's bad.
[251:59.98]I have zero ammo.
[252:01.74]I hope I don't have to kill anything, because that wouldn't work out.
[252:06.36]Okay.
[252:15.22]There's another one of these I can activate back there.
[252:20.32]I wonder which one it is.
[252:31.41]Alright, let's open it.
[252:48.02]Why are you playing this like an E3 demo?
[253:06.61]Am I?
[253:07.09]No, I'm not.
[253:13.68]Why?
[253:14.06]Is it because of the amount of times I've gone... Okay, so, okay.
[253:22.72]That's why.
[253:23.28]It's because the amount of times that I've done something and gone... Okay.
[253:30.60]Alright, so I think we're going left.
[253:35.55]What do you want?
[253:35.95]You want me to be quiet?
[253:37.95]Would you want me to not say a word?
[253:43.22]Fine, I'll give you the anti E3 playthrough.
[254:25.92]Um, this is unfair.
[254:28.70]Unfair horse shit.
[254:31.09]That's unfair dog shit.
[254:43.01]I better not be far away.
[254:44.13]Please don't put me far away.
[254:51.83]This is not bad.
[254:53.65]But what the fuck?
[254:55.79]Okay, whatever.
[254:56.57]Just go.
[254:58.77]So I have to fight two huge things.
[255:00.01]Okay, good to know.
[255:14.10]Take the shotgun out.
[255:15.08]It's two.
[255:16.16]Dodge two.
[255:18.32]I could also run.
[255:21.41]I'm gonna run.
[255:21.77]Is there anything else over here to do?
[255:24.14]Nope, go.
[255:24.60]Run.
[255:27.20]I forgot you go one mile per... I can't... I'm good.
[255:51.13]Go, go, go, go, go.
[255:52.15]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[255:54.51]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[255:55.01]Go, go, go, go, go.
[255:55.57]Okay, I'm good.
[256:08.52]Another super hard section.
[256:19.19]Is it a miss?
[256:34.92]Oh my God.
[256:39.96]Still alive.
[256:41.12]Score.
[257:21.27]Alright, time to go complete this.
[257:29.60]Good luck remembering how to get back there.
[257:45.74]Can you just help me?
[257:46.57]Wait, from here where do I go?
[257:58.17]Alright, I got it.
[258:00.32]Thank you.
[258:01.70]So now the machine is over here.
[258:06.82]Right?
[258:07.24]Yes.
[258:07.64]Alright, it's time.
[258:09.36]It's time to be.
[258:11.78]Time to complete the puzzle.
[258:15.00]Go out that way.
[258:15.72]Alright, let's go.
[258:16.78]How's this work?
[258:36.25]I don't understand what's happening.
[258:39.41]Oh, I do understand what's happening.
[258:40.99]Alright.
[258:52.88]Okay, wait.
[258:58.82]I need to get it up.
[259:01.20]Okay, where do I have to get it?
[259:05.46]It's gotta be up at the top.
[259:07.44]How do I get it up there?
[259:08.22]Uh-huh.
[259:47.10]I don't get it.
[260:01.15]How do I get it up in the two slots above where I need to go?
[260:04.45]You know what I mean?
[260:11.60]I can't move.
[260:12.56]There's nowhere for me to put the ball.
[260:17.32]Even up there, I wouldn't be able to connect it.
[260:24.23]So the ball is staying in the same place, but it's three different mazes.
[260:28.63]But the issue is, how do I get the ball up to the top when there's no way to move it to get it into those two slots at the top?
[261:02.21]How do I get it up?
[261:02.81]I don't get how I get it up there.
[261:06.88]Oh, I see.
[261:07.41]I see one.
[261:08.13]I see.
[261:08.45]How do I get up there?
[261:33.77]Yay.
[262:05.58]I can't let go of this.
[262:06.58]Where do I go from here?
[262:18.41]What happened?
[262:25.59]What the hell happened?
[262:40.96]What?
[263:14.02]Oh, the... Okay, that was weird, because, look, it was blocking me on... Wait, that was really weird.
[263:25.14]Okay, I thought I couldn't go up here.
[263:26.64]I had a lot of collision on that.
[263:27.92]I actually didn't think I could cross over it.
[263:30.48]No, no, like, I'm serious.
[263:31.66]I got stuck.
[263:32.54]I thought this was, like, blocking the path.
[263:36.42]Because I got stuck on it.
[263:38.68]You saw it.
[263:39.00]I got stuck.
[263:41.84]Yeah, see?
[263:42.52]I was like, oh, shit, I can't go up here.
[263:46.43]There's collision on some of that stuff.
[264:13.89]Weird.
[264:26.87]What happened?
[264:33.18]I think still alive.
[264:36.80]Oh, I got like ripped.
[264:40.02]Jesus.
[264:45.16]I won't do that ever again.
[264:45.96]I promise I'm done with that.
[264:50.94]You're not going to hear that for the rest of the day.
[265:00.44]I've almost completely turned into whatever I'm turning into.
[265:37.03]Am I controlling it?
[265:38.09]No.
[265:38.81]Where even are we?
[266:26.15]Score.
[266:37.12]Score.
[266:46.39]Score.
[266:47.23]I got out of my system.
[267:01.52]I'm going to clear these because I don't want to do them again.
[267:16.94]What the fuck is going on over here?
[267:37.68]This area is cool.
[267:46.83]Okay.
[267:49.17]Very interesting stuff.
[267:51.29]Very interested.
[267:55.93]So... Up, I guess...
[268:23.43]Score.
[268:24.29]What is in here?
[268:54.07]Alright, that wasn't E3.
[268:55.47]Alright, I'm done.
[268:57.85]I get it now.
[268:58.25]I know what you mean.
[269:00.75]What is in here?
[269:03.33]Go in and fucking find out why you... Oh, what is in here?
[269:09.32]Go in and find out.
[269:10.36]Like, why would I ask that, like, rhetorically out loud?
[269:13.62]That is E3 demo talk.
[269:16.20]I get you.
[269:16.58]I understand now.
[269:20.62]Wrapping around this corner, right?
[269:22.84]I know what you mean.
[269:24.24]It's Phil's air.
[270:06.04]interesting okay so this is alright so an alien species landed on Earth and started to like assimilate people I mean this is like oh look where this right this looks kind of like old god type of stuff
[270:40.95]Jesus.
[270:49.02]I guess I've grown into their heads.
[270:54.10]Alien tech.
[270:54.82]Yeah.
[271:09.14]What's the point of doing that?
[271:14.45]Oh, yeah, um, just, like, open up their ribcage and, like, peel their skin back and just peel it and just staple it.
[271:19.69]But what?
[271:20.03]Why?
[271:20.49]What?
[271:20.61]What's this for?
[271:22.25]It's just unnecessary.
[271:35.63]Okay.
[271:36.59]Well, that's weird.
[271:39.61]I can go down.
[271:40.43]I can go this way, too.
[271:45.69]Looks like there's a lot of places to go.
[271:50.88]Let me go up first here.
[271:55.88]This is different, what's this?
[272:12.46]Babies?
[272:15.79]Oh.
[272:24.47]OK.
[272:29.66]We're going to go this way.
[272:31.10]Now we're not.
[272:39.10]We're going to go the other way.
[273:05.04]I'm talking What's this gel Okay
[273:37.27]Is it... I don't know, like... I don't get it.
[273:41.93]You just stole Austin Powers' mojo.
[273:59.22]So what do I do with that?
[274:02.77]I guess I'm gonna... Wait, is there another place to go?
[274:04.99]No.
[274:12.91]Do you want me to play the Austin Powers theme song?
[274:18.16]Would that be good?
[274:19.46]Would that be fun?
[274:25.84]I can't take this back.
[274:36.87]I don't want to play the Austin Powers theme song because I feel like it would ruin the rest of the game.
[274:40.47]And we're getting to like the big climax.
[274:49.04]Look at those faces in here.
[275:13.73]Oh, I should have done that.
[275:15.41]I shouldn't have done that.
[275:16.49]I should not have done that.
[275:17.64]I don't... I shouldn't have done that.
[275:18.74]Does he get up?
[275:32.78]I don't... I don't think he gets up.
[275:34.84]Not yet at least.
[275:48.95]Plenty of health.
[275:49.63]Nice.
[275:49.87]Alright, good.
[275:51.52]Very good.
[275:51.96]Very good.
[275:52.34]Very good.
[275:57.00]Ammo.
[275:58.00]Fill it up.
[276:10.23]That looks good.
[276:11.65]I'm going to load the guns all up.
[276:15.29]That one's all good.
[276:18.87]This one is all good.
[276:20.15]Alright.
[276:21.79]Um.
[276:22.59]So.
[276:22.83]I imagine I take this one too.
[276:29.02]Will they fight each other?
[276:29.82]Excuse me.
[276:46.61]Uh.
[276:52.43]I don't get it, but whatever.
[276:53.51]I take this fucking thing.
[277:11.54]Do you fit in here?
[277:12.20]No.
[277:13.00]I don't know where to take this.
[280:12.97]Can't weigh this down.
[280:14.17]What do I do with this body?
[280:20.27]I don't want to keep holding this.
[280:21.43]This is fucking weird.
[280:22.63]This is gross.
[280:23.35]I don't want to keep holding this.
[280:27.44]Um...
[280:29.86]Where do I put it?
[280:36.77]Do I run this way?
[280:37.91]What do I do with this?
[280:52.84]Jesus!
[281:05.18]Okay, it's a full thing of, uh, of juice.
[281:07.92]Wait.
[281:08.54]Uh-oh.
[281:18.55]So I put this back on here and I filled this, so this person's... I'm gonna ruin this whole thing if I do this.
[281:27.48]I'll do it for one second.
[281:28.68]No, I'm not gonna.
[281:33.22]Fine, fuck it.
[281:33.80]What do I care, really?
[282:12.71]That didn't do anything.
[282:13.57]We need two of them.
[282:26.63]We need two.
[282:27.85]So I gotta get the other one and whatever.
[282:29.21]Okay, this one's gonna get up and I have to fight it.
[282:36.23]Can I go back this way?
[282:37.21]It's blocked off, right?
[282:44.16]Mm-hmm.
[282:46.12]Yep.
[282:48.50]I'm in.
[282:58.36]This time it's gonna get up and fight.
[282:59.64]Yeah, there's no doubt in my mind.
[283:11.59]Time to fight it.
[283:23.46]Ow.
[283:29.97]Why am I... I'm like a tree.
[283:33.51]Alright, I gotta shoot the sides, right?
[283:48.76]Are those explosive?
[283:49.94]Oh my god, they are.
[283:58.79]Oh my god, I think I'm dead in one hit.
[284:02.57]Move!
[284:42.66]See ya.
[285:29.35]What?
[285:32.58]Oh, come on.
[285:36.05]So you gotta wait till he runs out of gas.
[286:04.39]We've run out of gas already.
[286:11.03]Run out of fucking gas!
[286:12.69]Oh, come on.
[286:43.24]You just triple... What, did he get the lock and load?
[286:45.80]I just got triple tapped direct by two free grenades in a fucking row.
[286:50.41]Are you kidding me?
[286:51.27]He led me and lock and loaded me.
[287:09.91]Do I do?
[287:10.47]What?
[287:11.13]Oh, shoot him in the... I don't know what's going on.
[287:14.87]What am I... What's this?
[287:29.51]Get that.
[287:29.91]No.
[287:33.49]What?
[287:36.07]I don't get it.
[287:36.57]Did I screw up?
[287:39.64]I want to shake your hand.
[287:43.74]Stop, dude.
[287:51.87]Just fucking get out of here.
[288:02.63]Should I shoot him in the legs or something?
[288:07.93]Okay, this guy.
[288:14.57]If you kill me right now, I am going to eat this keyboard.
[288:17.61]You understand?
[288:18.13]Alright, open up.
[288:24.79]Open!
[288:27.20]What's going... Dude, how do I... The back, his back, his back.
[288:32.74]Oh my God, damn it, dude.
[288:34.26]Come on.
[288:34.84]It takes some...
[289:08.72]Move your fucking hand!
[289:29.98]What?
[289:32.24]Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!
[289:34.65]Gimme!
[289:47.38]Oh shit, another gun.
[290:03.12]Jesus, give me a fucking brick.
[290:45.18]That's not enough.
[290:50.29]That's not enough.
[290:53.33]I need another one.
[291:04.36]Is there another one even back here?
[291:07.54]Oh, this one.
[291:08.96]This one.
[291:15.07]How do I get over there?
[291:29.59]Good luck.
[291:30.86]Oh.
[291:35.82]Look at my health.
[291:37.16]That's bad.
[292:06.34]There's a claw.
[292:12.65]How do I get that to move?
[292:23.12]I don't know.
[292:46.43]I don't know.
[292:49.65]I actually don't know.
[292:59.76]Kapow, kapow, kapow.
[293:02.82]Shoot it?
[293:08.68]That didn't work.
[293:23.19]I shoot this?
[293:25.57]Holy shit.
[293:26.39]Okay.
[294:05.13]Do I have to fight this again?
[294:05.99]I hope not.
[294:11.21]Do not.
[294:13.09]No.
[294:13.81]I have to fight another one of these.
[294:15.21]I have to fight it again.
[294:18.81]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[294:20.71]I don't want to fight this thing again.
[294:21.81]I have no health.
[294:22.78]I'm going to lose.
[294:23.50]Dude.
[294:32.42]This sucks.
[294:33.52]I don't want to fight this thing.
[294:38.73]What if I explode it?
[294:42.87]When it goes down for gas, I'm going to shoot this.
[294:50.35]Going down for gas.
[294:55.73]Oh my god, I just did it.
[294:58.83]What did I just do?
[295:03.19]Are you dead?
[295:07.55]What?
[295:07.67]Did I just do it?
[295:17.32]Cool.
[295:17.84]Alright.
[295:21.06]Alright, I got it.
[295:41.54]What is even going on?
[295:45.65]I have way more questions than the beginning of the game.
[295:51.71]What's happening here?
[296:27.60]Um, I can't use any other weapon.
[296:32.90]I can't take this off.
[296:40.07]Alright, well, we got both of them filled up here.
[296:47.77]What?
[296:49.59]Wait, is it saying I can't pick this up because my hands are covered in weird tree shit?
[297:01.84]Are you serious?
[297:02.76]I can't do this.
[297:10.95]Um... How do I get this off?
[297:32.80]Okay.
[297:36.15]What's this?
[297:51.94]That scream.
[297:54.04]It was like a Tom and Jerry sound.
[298:02.91]Excuse me!
[298:03.89]Where's the help?
[298:16.68]SCORN.
[298:54.40]Uh huh.
[299:25.02]Reload!
[299:43.34]I think you're actually softlocking.
[299:44.84]What?
[299:48.48]No, I'm not.
[299:49.92]I bet you I jump in that suit and I get healed.
[300:04.49]Yeah, I just gotta get the thing, run to that suit, and jump right in it.
[300:38.71]down down
[301:04.44]Alright, I can't do this.
[301:06.68]So I have to go over here.
[301:08.50]And then down.
[301:09.02]What's this?
[301:16.35]Okay.
[301:23.21]What the hell is... Oh.
[301:29.86]Wait, should I just get in this now?
[301:31.10]No, I can't.
[301:33.30]Alright, so what about over here?
[301:41.00]This looks like a track or an elevator.
[301:48.98]I have this key.
[301:51.95]Oh, come on.
[301:57.79]No.
[302:00.27]Oh, yes.
[302:00.81]I was going to say, can I not interact with it?
[302:25.40]We're back.
[302:28.05]Right, I can't do this.
[302:28.73]Okay, so now rip it off.
[302:32.23]Get in the suit.
[302:37.73]What else is over here?
[302:40.08]This is a five bubble door.
[302:41.89]I don't have a five bubble key.
[302:45.79]Am I seeing this right?
[303:17.67]What's going on?
[303:20.09]What is happening?
[303:22.91]Don't look.
[303:33.88]Scored.
[303:35.04]I'm not pressing it again.
[303:35.82]Alright, so let's get this thing ripped off.
[304:08.59]Okay.
[304:11.01]And let's go.
[304:21.60]That's just, that's just ammo.
[304:23.30]That's ammo for the gun.
[304:24.28]Alright.
[304:24.92]Um, what's going on?
[304:29.02]Did you just come back?
[304:35.74]Shit.
[304:36.50]Um, okay.
[304:40.91]Really?
[304:44.37]OK.
[304:46.39]I'm going to get the thing ripped off.
[304:47.39]I'm going to open this door.
[304:53.20]OK.
[305:01.82]What does that do for me?
[305:09.19]What is happening?
[305:10.51]Ah!
[305:10.69]Should I shoot this?
[305:13.65]Oh, fuck.
[305:16.98]Okay, hold on.
[305:17.56]What?
[305:52.79]Dude, you alright?
[305:53.35]Dude, are you cool?
[305:55.99]What's he doing?
[306:03.03]Hello?
[306:03.39]I got scorned.
[306:21.38]It was poisonous.
[306:23.49]What do I do here?
[306:27.95]Should I just reset the game?
[306:29.09]Alright, I'm going to quit.
[306:32.85]Now go to main menu, right?
[306:35.19]Back to main menu and then continue the game.
[307:16.35]Wait, don't do that again.
[307:17.21]OK, so now this is I have to go get bit by that thing again.
[307:31.12]Pick up the aim.
[307:31.70]Let me heal.
[307:32.08]How much health do I have?
[307:33.28]Let's heal.
[307:36.56]Alright, so get bit, pick up the thing, grab the key.
[308:01.86]Alright, good.
[308:07.00]Nice.
[308:14.02]So now I have the key to get out of here.
[308:15.67]I got a full stack of bombs.
[308:26.73]I'm okay.
[308:28.63]Alright.
[308:30.31]Where's the door?
[308:38.33]Is it over here?
[308:38.85]Okay, it's right here.
[308:40.11]So I get bit?
[308:44.03]Wait.
[308:45.33]No.
[308:45.93]I have to get bit and then come do this.
[308:49.01]Whatever this is.
[308:52.67]Right.
[308:53.01]So let's get bit.
[308:54.15]Come do this.
[308:58.31]No.
[308:59.05]Just do the door.
[308:59.57]Okay.
[309:05.42]Okay.
[309:07.07]Alright, what's the fastest place to get bit?
[309:08.45]Right here and then run across.
[309:09.25]Let's go.
[309:17.37]I need the mojo?
[309:18.49]Where's the mojo?
[309:20.93]Where is it?
[309:23.50]Where is the mojo?
[309:26.54]Is it on my... Let me just open this door.
[309:29.80]It'll stay open.
[309:33.58]Okay, where's the mojo?
[309:44.84]How am I gonna get back there?
[309:46.64]Okay, how am I gonna get bit and run back and do this?
[309:49.14]Am I gonna have enough time?
[309:54.12]Bit.
[309:55.43]Run, run, run.
[309:56.73]Maybe.
[309:57.13]I might just have just barely enough time.
[309:59.23]Okay, I'm gonna try it.
[310:06.30]Okay, here we go.
[310:24.10]Thanks for lying.
[310:24.68]Thanks for the whole experience bubble of Warcraft experience taken from me and health.
[310:31.38]I appreciate it.
[310:36.80]Just going straight.
[310:40.27]Straight on.
[310:58.46]Damn, okay.
[311:02.78]Oh, is this like the... This is like the extraction machine, I think.
[311:20.01]Do I actually have to... Can I even make it from here?
[311:29.27]I feel like I'm not going to make it.
[311:30.79]Isn't there... There's a closer one.
[311:38.04]No, I'm not going to make it.
[311:44.44]This is longer.
[311:46.69]I'm just going to try it.
[311:47.45]Whatever.
[311:47.73]I'm just going to try it.
[312:09.65]Go go go go go!
[312:40.07]Wait, I have to perform surgery on myself?
[312:43.17]Oh!
[312:46.44]Oh, my goodness!
[312:49.20]Dude, what?
[313:10.49]uh...
[313:46.84]Got my mojo back, baby!
[313:48.82]Oh shit!
[313:53.05]They're all coming for me!
[314:18.61]I got my mojo back.
[314:26.50]Get me out of here.
[314:42.51]How do I?
[314:43.09]Wait, you blocked it back.
[314:44.03]You blocked it off.
[315:57.61]Oh, my God.
[317:00.08]That gives me a headache.
[317:05.21]Look down.
[317:05.81]I know I see I'm holding my intestines.
[317:23.52]OK.
[317:44.37]Bro.
[317:48.67]Give me a break, man.
[317:49.55]Are you kidding me?
[317:51.67]What?
[317:58.05]Jeez.
[318:06.07]Holy Jesus, man.
[318:08.79]Fucking relax.
[318:11.35]What the fuck?
[318:15.15]This is huge!
[318:16.25]That's fu- Alright.
[318:25.49]What the fuck is going on?
[318:31.24]I still have no idea what's happening.
[318:50.93]Oh, alright, I'm going back, I'm going down.
[318:54.21]I can plug the other thing in, right?
[319:03.52]Let's go, oh, wrong way.
[319:47.59]Alright, here we go.
[319:50.85]What happens now?
[319:51.47]We're going up.
[320:33.28]I can hear somebody moving.
[321:13.25]What the fuck?
[321:14.86]What the fuck was that, man?
[322:01.99]Uh, what?
[322:44.15]Switch?
[322:44.57]What do you mean switch?
[322:48.59]Wait, how do I switch?
[322:49.75]Oh, wait, what are they doing?
[322:55.27]How do I switch?
[323:13.24]How do I switch?
[323:14.90]What button is that?
[323:15.96]Switch what?
[323:16.44]How do I switch this?
[324:09.51]You wanted to go first?
[324:10.47]I don't have one of those, do you?
[324:21.78]I don't have one of those either.
[324:24.75]Well, the grand alien plan is ruined.
[324:33.04]We can't move.
[324:33.76]We can't go anywhere.
[324:57.82]Why won't this open?
[324:58.52]What's the problem?
[325:26.74]Alright, you stay here.
[325:27.50]I'm gonna go investigate.
[325:40.25]No?
[325:43.94]No, am I crazy?
[325:47.96]I look like I'm made out of plastic.
[325:53.10]Oh, here it is.
[326:04.38]Are we aliens or are we... What are we?
[326:06.70]Are we aliens?
[326:24.10]Uh, watch out behind you.
[326:56.60]Can I just walk through it?
[327:28.64]Because you both have it, right?
[327:47.13]Sorry, there can only be one.
[328:03.97]Am I missing something?
[328:09.18]I'm missing.
[328:25.05]The way this camera angle looks like a piano is going to fall on this guy.
[328:28.99]Any second now.
[328:30.59]Can I move this or something?
[328:46.42]What am I missing?
[328:47.18]Eyes fire.
[328:47.50]Go right to the goal.
[328:49.69]Hmm.
[329:22.92]Eyes.
[329:23.12]Fire.
[329:26.38]Poof to the goal.
[329:35.41]Should I just... I'm biting my lip like crazy.
[329:37.61]Should I just go this way and explore over here?
[329:42.37]Can I even walk over here?
[329:48.08]Can I stop this from happening?
[330:01.03]Wait, what am I doing?
[330:01.81]Alright, they both need one of these.
[330:09.16]Alright, they both need one of...
[330:59.74]If I don't put his hand on it... Do I just put... Can I place the body down here?
[331:22.27]I feel like that's what I have to do.
[332:00.15]Do we weigh more?
[332:02.09]I'm fine.
[332:08.30]Oh shit, what's happening?
[332:34.65]I can't move.
[332:36.21]I can't turn.
[332:38.46]All I can do is walk straight.
[333:28.72]What?
[333:29.58]This thing again?
[333:33.73]What?
[333:39.09]Hey, thanks for fucking standing there the whole time.
[333:47.53]Thanks for standing there.
[333:51.55]Really?
[333:51.87]Did I not?
[334:19.22]Wait, did I not make it?
[334:22.44]Is that what we're implying here?
[334:23.78]That I didn't make it to the end?
[334:37.99]Wait, what?
[334:38.81]We're 10 feet away from whatever we were doing?
[334:41.86]That's it?
[334:55.88]you
[335:55.99]I was really hoping it was going to say then it was going to be on screen.
[336:01.47]Okay, that was weird.
[336:04.91]So... It's... Oh, you're trying to...
[336:11.71]continue whatever civilization or something but there are these mutated monsters that are stopping us and I get right to the end and I almost get through whatever the Earth canal or something and then the thing stops me and eats me and consumes me and we didn't end up actually doing it I got there but I didn't make it I'll just watch a fatty video about it
[336:43.46]Press continue.
[336:59.73]Okay, can I... I'm curious.
[337:02.19]Hold on a second.
[337:06.56]Can I walk through with this one?
[337:08.10]Or do you have to walk through with this one?
[337:18.60]No, okay.
[337:20.88]That's the only way.
[337:21.50]Alright.
[337:23.96]Why do I keep stabbing him?
[337:25.99]What's with the keep stabbing, stab, stab?
[337:27.57]I don't get it.
[337:28.03]Why do I have to keep stabbing this?
[337:30.65]I think this is broken.
[337:41.10]I think this is bugged out.
[337:52.25]There's no definitive answer for anything.
[337:54.13]I mean, that was crazy.
[337:55.21]That was... Okay, that last 20 minutes was... That was insane.
[338:07.48]I'll watch a couple of videos on it.
[338:08.96]That was good.
[338:09.26]That was cool.
[338:09.98]I like that.
[338:11.88]I very much enjoyed that.
[338:17.92]And that's a perfect time to end the stream, too.
[338:20.24]Alright, so listen to me.
[338:21.08]This is important.
[338:23.06]We've got a lot going on this weekend.
[338:26.74]On Thursday.
[338:29.32]Thursday, I'm going to be playing Gotham Knights Sponsored.
[338:32.73]Are you ready for this?
[338:35.37]Friday, I'm going to be playing Gotham Knights Sponsored.
[338:38.39]Saturday, I'm going to be playing Gotham Knights Sponsored three days in a row.
[338:43.19]But, here's the thing.
[338:46.70]I'm not just going to play Gotham Knights Sponsored.
[338:55.45]We're gonna do another Omega Gaming Weekend.
[338:58.89]It's an Omega sponsor, it really is.
[339:04.71]It's like... It's like, let's go, you know what I mean?
[339:08.36]Like, sometimes you just have to say, fuck it, let's go.
[339:12.96]So...
[339:14.75]the Gotham Knights portion of each one of those streams on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday are only going to be for a couple hours.
[339:21.69]Then, for the remaining three, four, five plus hours, whatever, we're going to do something else.
[339:27.35]So keep this in mind.
[339:28.30]I am contractually obligated to stream three days in a row.
[339:34.38]Some of it's going to be Gotham Knights.
[339:36.12]So I have to be here.
[339:38.80]I am not going to say to you guys...
[339:40.88]Oh, you know, it's like, I just streamed on Thursday, I'll see you on Sunday.
[339:45.38]No.
[339:46.78]I'm contractually obligated to be here.
[339:50.20]So, we're going to play Gotham Knights for a few days in a row.
[339:54.41]But we're also going to do a bunch of other shit too.
[339:56.41]I want to play horror games this weekend.
[340:02.01]I want to play the Puppet Combo games, the new ones that came out.
[340:05.43]I want to play Breath of the Wild this weekend.
[340:09.57]I don't know, Gotham Knights.
[340:12.01]Looks like it could be really fun.
[340:14.50]I don't know very much about it.
[340:15.50]I know it's... It's a game set in... Arkham.
[340:24.36]No, it's not.
[340:25.50]Not Arkham.
[340:25.98]I meant to say Gotham.
[340:29.69]It's a game set in... No, Gotham is the city.
[340:33.03]Arkham is not the city.
[340:35.11]Gotham is the city.
[340:36.13]I don't know why I thought it was Arkham.
[340:39.67]That's my bad.
[340:40.91]What a fake fan.
[340:41.83]No, I just screwed up.
[340:43.19]I was trying to say that the city, Gotham, it takes place in Gotham, not Arkham.
[340:59.21]Anyways, we're going to play Gotham Knights for three days and a bunch of other shit.
[341:08.20]I'm actually pretty excited.
[341:12.42]So I'll see you on Thursday.
[341:13.50]We're not going to start with Gotham Knights.
[341:17.87]Gotham Knights will appear for like a couple hours.
[341:23.23]Right in the middle of all these streams.
[341:25.87]It's going to be super variety.
[341:28.54]We are going to be changing games every two or three hours.
[341:32.62]And I'm going to wear the Nightwing shirt.
[341:33.78]You better bet your ass I'm going to.
[341:38.20]Why am I such a frog today?
[341:41.19]But that's going to be the end of this stream.
[341:42.49]Why am I so froggy today?
[341:44.78]Listen to this.
[341:47.56]I'll see you guys on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
[341:51.48]Starting around 4 o'clock Pacific.
[341:59.09]Gotham Knights, Breath of the Wild, Puppet Combo, and some other shit.
[342:06.27]We'll see.
[342:10.40]Scoring was cool.
[342:11.82]That was a lot of fun.
[342:13.50]The first 10 minutes, I was like, oh shit, this is a puzzle game.
[342:17.42]But there's enough interesting stuff happening, and I think a lot of the weird horror elements were enough to really keep you going.
[342:24.20]It was good.
[342:25.12]I thought it was fun.
[342:27.82]It was definitely an experience.
[342:30.28]I'll say that.
[342:36.47]But yeah, I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[342:39.70]Or, uh, well, is it Omega Gaming Weekend, or is it just Thursday, Friday, and then one day on Saturday?
[342:49.02]It's good to be back.
[342:53.25]Omega Sponsor Weekend.
[342:58.09]And I like, you know, it's kind of interesting, though.
[343:02.01]I will have a hard date for you guys for the Battle Act stream.
[343:07.52]Within the next couple of weeks.
[343:10.09]This is happening really soon.
[343:23.33]What's the battle axe stream?
[343:24.31]I'm going to dodge a battle axe in real life.
[343:27.79]That's it.
[343:32.63]Is that stream going to be 10 minutes?
[343:33.75]Is it going to be as long as I want it to be?
[343:37.69]So, don't worry.
[343:42.63]Alright, I'll talk to you guys soon.
[343:49.56]See you later.
[343:50.28]Good night.
[343:50.94]Thanks for watching.
[343:52.15]See you Thursday.
[343:54.59]Goodbye.
