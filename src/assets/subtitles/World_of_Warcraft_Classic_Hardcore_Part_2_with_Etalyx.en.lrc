[ve:61.1.100]

[00:25.29]How's it going?
[00:29.45]Not quite ready.
[00:30.17]I'm going to get auto outside.
[00:34.47]We'll get the ads to knock out the pre-rolls here in a second, probably in the next few minutes.
[00:44.33]And I'll be back.
[00:50.80]See you in a minute.
[00:51.52]I'll see you in like 10 minutes.
[00:55.85]uh ads are gonna play by the way just want to make sure okay I can put this on the screen can I there we go just to let people know I'll be back in a few minutes
[05:00.37]Wait, did the ads not even start?
[05:03.15]Huh?
[05:03.29]I thought they were going to start.
[05:08.69]They might happen any second now.
[05:11.89]Well... Huh?
[05:20.63]I got a pre-roll.
[05:21.25]I had pre-rolls.
[05:22.91]That's weird.
[05:25.29]Well, uh...
[05:27.98]Okay.
[05:29.34]I guess they're not playing.
[05:31.22]I guess we're just going to go.
[05:35.32]My dad's playing World of Warcraft 2.
[05:36.83]I hope you see him.
[05:41.95]That was very delayed.
[05:51.74]Okay.
[05:52.18]Well, whatever.
[05:52.82]We'll just sit here for a minute or two.
[05:57.24]Sometimes it's like, oh, the ads are starting now, and it doesn't do it for like four minutes.
[06:14.07]Yeah, for those of you that are here, we're still grinding in World of Warcraft.
[06:21.63]I'm on my Warlock we played yesterday.
[06:23.29]I'm currently very into it.
[06:25.17]I'm very addicted to it.
[06:35.13]We got a lot to do today.
[06:36.03]I gotta try to get to 13, 14 or probably 15.
[06:42.17]I want to get 15 before I do a dungeon.
[06:44.31]I ain't dying in Ragefire Chasm, OK?
[06:48.63]Did I do this on purpose?
[06:57.17]No, actually I did not.
[07:09.54]How come there's a voice on the ads?
[07:10.90]Yeah, that's true.
[07:20.33]Oh, I love peppermint.
[07:21.39]Alright, let me make sure my... Well, I have a minute here extra.
[07:26.95]Let me make sure my bars are good.
[07:29.18]I want to start at like 11, but I decided to have a huge lunch.
[07:34.16]I'm not going to wait for everyone to get back from the ads.
[07:38.47]I did promise that if ads were going to be on this channel, it would always be on no content.
[07:44.15]And this me talking is content.
[07:45.49]I'm fucking the whole thing up.
[07:50.31]Big sneeze.
[07:51.17]Did you hear that?
[07:53.01]Big sneeze.
[08:05.22]BRB screen is content.
[08:16.80]Alright, about 20 seconds then we can get started.
[08:26.23]Some of your best work has happened during a BRB screen.
[08:38.79]Okay, hi, sorry about that.
[08:40.17]I thought they were going to start four or five minutes ago, but they started three minutes ago.
[08:45.45]I got it wrong.
[08:46.01]But anyways, welcome back.
[08:46.85]I hope you're having a good day.
[08:50.67]I'm doing well.
[08:51.51]I ate a lot of food.
[08:52.57]The reason why I started about 30 minutes late today is, well, more than that, because I wanted to eat lunch.
[08:58.19]I wanted to get some fuel.
[08:59.05]I wanted to make sure Otto was taken care of and he went outside and he's good.
[09:02.84]But yeah, I'm ready to go.
[09:08.85]I'm picking up exactly where I left off.
[09:18.60]We were in the Undercity.
[09:22.40]The goal is to get to at least 13 or 14.
[09:27.07]And I'm 11?
[09:27.81]Am I 11 or 12?
[09:28.41]I don't remember.
[09:31.07]I cleaned up my bars a little.
[09:32.23]See?
[09:32.99]This is a little more... This is a little better.
[09:35.96]I actually have the healing potions and the health.
[09:40.08]This is all I can press that button and be good.
[09:48.73]We love to curse in Spanish.
[09:51.39]Um...
[09:54.24]No, but I... Yeah, you can curse and just don't write anything fucked up.
[09:59.65]You know, it's easy to translate stuff.
[10:08.71]Okay, so is it... Can you guys hear this?
[10:10.39]That's why it's so low.
[10:16.07]Is this low or... No, maybe not.
[10:17.67]Maybe I'm just crazy.
[10:22.29]I can hear the footsteps.
[10:28.48]Alright, so I was gonna go to... Oh, also, um... I did see a couple of things yesterday, and I would like to, uh... I'd like to, you know, address them.
[10:44.67]First of which is, I believe, I think Soda tried to invite me to the guild.
[10:48.89]And I have auto-decline set up.
[10:50.97]So I just auto-declined him.
[10:53.67]Uh, so I probably should figure that out.
[10:59.95]So I would gladly accept that invitation.
[11:04.85]I just need to turn off the auto-decline thing and figure it out.
[11:09.09]The second thing, which is important too, I saw a thread yesterday about some guy saying that there was no way in this guy's mind I was going to hit 60.
[11:20.34]He said, I'm just going to paraphrase this a little bit, if he gets to 60, I will eat my dinner through my ass.
[11:30.48]And all I got to say to that is, dude, I would make sure you don't buy any pineapples the week that I hit 60.
[11:36.11]Let's make it a good... Maybe we should get a stockpile of cottage cheese for a little while.
[11:41.71]Doesn't... We'll see.
[11:50.03]We'll see.
[11:51.81]We'll find out, won't we?
[11:55.55]Why would you say that?
[11:56.67]I didn't say that.
[11:57.57]I am reacting to somebody saying that about me.
[12:09.47]Why cottage cheese in particular?
[12:10.85]Because... Do I have to tell you why?
[12:12.77]What are you talking about?
[12:14.33]I just said don't buy any pineapples the week I hit 60.
[12:19.86]Make sure you don't buy like the extra crunchy fucking Cheez-Its.
[12:33.01]Why would he have a whole pineapple for dinner without taking the outside off?
[12:39.46]Just let the joke be the joke, okay?
[12:42.04]I worked on that all morning.
[12:43.14]Alright, where am I going?
[12:56.01]I just got my Voidwalker.
[12:59.85]Oh, I got to return the book.
[13:02.45]And then we go over here.
[13:08.47]I'm not accepting any group invitations right now.
[13:12.28]I want to get EXP grinding.
[13:18.30]Yesterday, I probably would be 15 right now.
[13:21.80]But I was getting like 12 experience a kill.
[13:25.92]I got to get locked in here.
[13:26.88]Alright, let's go.
[13:32.51]Did I put anything in the bank?
[13:34.51]Oh, this bullshit.
[13:35.15]I forgot about this.
[13:37.57]Okay.
[13:42.26]Let's leave this piece of crap zone.
[13:45.10]Okay, now it is loud.
[13:53.04]How did it go from so quiet to so loud?
[13:54.68]That's crazy.
[14:00.80]If you ever get stuck in the undercity, just make sure you, uh, just go to the, uh, the guardians.
[14:07.13]That's how you get out.
[14:14.59]Oh my god, I almost just died.
[14:20.50]I'm always gonna wait for a full revolution.
[14:23.12]There's no way.
[14:27.29]Hey, can we get some Kiss from a Rose by Seal again to start it off?
[14:31.14]That's a classic.
[14:32.08]Oh, yeah, today, by the way, guys, it is Spell Click Sunday.
[14:37.52]But I think going forward, I'm probably going to just make, we'll probably just have it be like this.
[14:42.08]It'd be like regular streams of this too.
[14:45.52]Spell Click Sunday is we, you know, I click on my abilities sometimes, like for funny.
[14:50.53]But I think I'm just going to make it like each, like a regular thing.
[14:53.69]So it's not a special thing anymore.
[15:06.89]Seal Sunday.
[15:21.00]Does this mean that you're back?
[15:24.26]I'm back for as long as I am enjoying doing whatever I'm doing.
[15:28.64]That's all there is to it.
[15:51.19]I am still, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm just here for when I'm here.
[15:59.07]Can you fix your UI skill?
[16:00.63]Well, when you say fix my UI skill, um, it is fixed for me.
[16:07.27]I like the big, huge icons.
[16:10.73]It's easier for me to see.
[16:18.70]Plus you get to see the cool artwork.
[16:26.20]I gotta get a profession or something.
[16:27.52]I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[16:33.56]Uh, I'm gonna go like this.
[16:38.03]That scared the shit out of me, whatever that was.
[16:41.35]Oh, somebody just gave me.
[16:43.10]You priest?
[16:45.34]Oh.
[16:50.58]You're gonna play Clash of Clans?
[16:52.58]I think Clash of Clans is one of those games that is guaranteed to never be on this stream.
[17:00.57]I just... I have no desire to play that game.
[17:02.95]I just don't.
[17:06.41]Sorry.
[17:07.13]Sorry, all the Clash of Clans fans.
[17:11.86]Clash of Clans isn't... People still play Clash of Clans?
[17:21.74]What, do you have 5 million power in Clash of Clans?
[17:26.06]That's so crazy.
[17:26.96]Oh my god.
[17:28.52]And I think I'm so much more powerful than you.
[17:33.37]You only have 5 million points?
[17:34.85]Well, that's a lot.
[17:35.79]And by the way, we're cool.
[17:39.95]And then somebody else shows up and says, I have 25 million power.
[17:44.78]And the two cool people say, oh fuck, oh my god, how did you get that?
[17:49.77]How did you get that power?
[17:50.93]That's impossible.
[17:51.97]Well, you see, what I did is I started with the Egyptian power, which gave me extra resources.
[17:56.81]Something like that, right?
[18:08.27]They all go like that.
[18:09.21]I, you know, I have no idea.
[18:12.11]They all blend together into the same ad in my head.
[18:14.84]Alright, this is, I gotta kill Bleeding Horrors and Wandering Spirit.
[18:24.83]These need to go to level 11, so don't.
[18:26.39]I do have my Voidwalker though, so things are going to be fine.
[18:29.47]Wait, food buff.
[18:39.03]I thought that was an enemy.
[18:43.26]I got all the buffs too, right?
[18:44.86]Make sure I'm okay.
[18:45.46]This is two health per five.
[18:46.44]That's good.
[18:47.70]I did get my red shirt.
[18:55.48]Is three stamina better than one intellect at level 10?
[18:59.12]I think it actually might be.
[19:01.52]30 extra health.
[19:02.04]That's like one or two hits from an enemy.
[19:06.65]It is?
[19:07.71]Okay, yeah.
[19:09.11]Staying alive is better than being able to cast half of a spell.
[19:16.95]Alright, I'm gonna... I have to be very careful.
[19:20.52]This place is probably bad.
[19:21.98]I don't have the add-on that tells me that like 5,000 people died here.
[19:32.72]All I need is a spawn to take me out.
[19:39.80]I think I want to get it after.
[19:41.82]When are you going to play a mobile game on stream?
[19:54.43]I think I did a long time ago.
[19:56.29]I made videos of old mobile games and.
[20:05.38]The thing about mobile games nowadays, though, is I feel like a lot of mobile games just... I think I told you this before.
[20:14.06]Hold on.
[20:15.00]I just messed up my words because I got scared of that guy.
[20:18.36]Okay.
[20:20.25]Apps on the App Store now.
[20:22.23]It's like, oh, take a look and see, this is what the company is collecting from you while you agree to download the game about, like, planting fucking carrots in the ground.
[20:30.35]Or whatever the game is.
[20:32.70]It's like, oh, every... We want everything about you.
[20:34.98]We want your email address.
[20:36.30]We want your phone number.
[20:36.90]We want your fucking address.
[20:38.40]It's just like, what the fuck, man?
[20:52.11]I just want to play the fun game.
[21:00.47]All of your mobile games are... All of your mobile game opinions are kind of shit because of how much time and money you spent on the Family Guy game.
[21:07.45]Guys... But because I played a... By the way, that was back in like 2013.
[21:22.45]You're never going to live that down.
[21:24.73]Whatever.
[21:25.11]People spend money on the stupidest shit anyways.
[21:28.31]Like, I can't spend some money on some stupid shit?
[21:35.67]Everybody has spent some kind of money on just something that they go, oh, that wasn't worth it.
[21:49.82]If you do it, it's worse because you're a role model.
[21:55.29]Wait, why do I have to hold myself to an unbelievable standard?
[22:00.50]I can't play the Family Guy game because I'm a role model.
[22:03.58]What are you?
[22:04.14]No, I don't want to be a role model.
[22:05.74]I want to be able to play the fucking Family Guy game.
[22:29.76]Can I make a Ken?
[22:34.96]What about your nieces and nephews?
[22:36.10]They're watching.
[22:37.32]No, my nieces and nephews watched the Lego Star Wars stream because that was like in this Lego Star Wars category.
[22:55.71]The best and worst role model.
[22:57.21]You know what?
[22:57.91]Here.
[23:00.14]All I can say is do your best.
[23:04.73]Take time for yourself.
[23:06.43]Take care of the people that you love.
[23:08.95]And try to be nice to people.
[23:11.23]And protect yourself.
[23:13.58]Defend yourself and protect your body, right?
[23:18.06]Take care of your body.
[23:21.08]And if you want to...
[23:25.12]Oh, I thought, okay, they're doing the RP walk.
[23:28.95]And if you want, as a grown man, to spend $50 on a dumb mobile game, go do it.
[23:37.89]Go do it.
[23:39.41]If you want to do that, if that's what you feel like doing, alright, well, whatever.
[23:43.40]If that's what you decided to do today.
[23:59.52]Maybe you should... Oh, I can't really... I can't see.
[24:11.07]He's a gambler.
[24:15.70]Yeah, TL;DR, the Family Guy, the quest for stuff.
[24:18.66]I enjoyed it.
[24:19.58]I collected a bunch of coins.
[24:21.66]And I loved so much when you clicked on Quagmire and you would get the ripped audio from a random episode of the game.
[24:29.58]No new dialog was recorded.
[24:34.18]It's always funny when there's ever like licensed video games, stuff like that, because they will do like sentence splicing in a way.
[24:42.70]like one time like if Peter Griffin like stubbed his toe and was like ah my toe if you click on Peter Griffin and you like and you you hit oh you clicked on him oh you clicked it he goes ow my toe from that episode it's like it's like they made um like gmod youtube videos
[25:05.96]They found like contextual info and contextual dialog that just went with stuff in the game, I think.
[25:16.45]I love when that happens.
[25:17.33]It's like my favorite thing.
[25:29.66]Can you do your best, Peter Griffin?
[25:30.70]No, Peter Griffin is one of those.
[25:32.38]It's a Christopher Walken.
[25:36.28]A bad Peter Griffin is bad.
[25:37.60]A good Peter Griffin gets you high fives at the bar.
[25:40.38]And I'm not the guy that can do the good one.
[25:58.10]Do a sprint where you just do... Wait, Chris, can you thrall?
[26:00.66]No.
[26:06.60]I feel like the prerequisite to do a Thrall impression is you have to be six feet taller.
[26:10.10]I just can't.
[26:13.76]I don't have the boisterous amount of vocals to do that.
[26:16.00]Yes.
[26:33.81]What about if you put on platforms first?
[26:35.39]Uh, yeah, maybe I would try it.
[26:38.40]It actually might help.
[26:57.71]You're pretty cool, I think.
[27:05.44]I did not see the new Sonic movie.
[27:06.68]No, I haven't seen any of the new ones.
[27:08.17]I've only seen the first one.
[27:13.51]Are the movies like the games where Sonic 3 is the best one in the movie and the game?
[27:21.50]Or is Sonic 1 the best one?
[27:26.66]3 is the best one.
[27:27.94]So it is just like the games then.
[27:44.18]Somebody reminded me yesterday and I completely forgot.
[27:46.26]I need to actually get hurt because this skill needs to be leveled up.
[27:49.83]So I need to take some damage.
[27:56.99]I need one more horror.
[28:09.84]Is it Etalyx?
[28:10.44]It probably was, yeah.
[28:16.79]I hate corruption having a cast time.
[28:18.55]That sucks.
[28:20.17]You have to go into affliction to get rid of it, and I really don't want to go into affliction to get rid of it.
[28:34.44]Character kind of looks like you.
[28:35.64]Yeah, whatever.
[28:36.26]He looks pretty cool.
[28:40.10]He looks awesome.
[28:44.04]Did you even see the gear?
[28:44.76]Take a look at that.
[28:47.98]Alex, uh, dropped off some cool stuff.
[28:51.18]What do you think I should eat today?
[29:00.65]Don't say McDonald's.
[29:01.93]Um, I don't know.
[29:07.90]What do you feel like about, um, how about, how about two dropped eggs on toast?
[29:17.45]If you have poached eggs on toast with a little bit of butter on the toast, go ahead and change your life.
[29:26.06]Two poached eggs.
[29:27.68]Two pieces of toast.
[29:29.46]Butter the bread.
[29:30.12]And drop that poached egg on the toast.
[29:38.43]And then cut it up into bite-sized pieces.
[29:41.45]Let the kind of over easy to over medium-ish poached egg get in there.
[29:47.44]Unbelievable.
[29:48.74]Salt and pepper as well.
[29:51.68]Poached eggs are impossible.
[29:52.96]Yeah, I know.
[29:55.48]You can learn though.
[29:56.10]I want to keep going this way.
[30:08.11]Eggs Benedict is great, too.
[30:09.11]Eggs Benedict is awesome.
[30:11.11]I have to be in the mood for it, though, because the Hollandaise, like, freaks me out.
[30:16.13]Something about Hollandaise is just... I don't know.
[30:19.65]When you know how it's made, you're like, oh, wait, it is a little... That's what it is?
[30:29.78]I'm like a food safety weirdo.
[30:32.08]And I know that, like, you know, pasteurization and what, but...
[30:39.87]It's just egg.
[30:40.65]I know, I know.
[30:46.03]I like my eggs over medium.
[30:47.49]I don't really like them super runny and isn't isn't hollandaise just kind of you gently, very low heat.
[30:53.17]You like barely don't even cook the eggs.
[30:58.54]I don't really like undercooked eggs.
[31:12.05]What am I looking for here?
[31:19.83]You're an undercooked egg.
[31:21.01]Get the fuck out of here.
[31:28.76]Okay, I need to kill five scarlet friars.
[31:33.20]I don't want to pull every single person here.
[31:46.79]Do they run?
[31:47.25]Because that would be bad if they do.
[31:49.81]They do.
[31:50.21]Alright, that's not good.
[31:50.93]Alright, take them one at a time.
[32:00.35]Just this one, right?
[32:00.99]Okay.
[32:13.44]Five scarlet friars sounds like something you bring your true love on the 12 days of Christmas.
[32:31.45]Seven buzzards buzzing.
[32:33.35]Six doors are creaking.
[32:36.06]Five scarlet friars.
[32:39.99]Four dashing hens, three French horns, two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree.
[32:50.45]Yeah, it fits.
[33:03.78]Should I level up the dagger at all?
[33:06.36]Does that not matter at all?
[33:08.22]I don't think it does at all.
[33:27.36]It's almost like you just read an AI generated version of that or picture of that.
[33:31.48]Yeah.
[33:37.08]Hey, chat GPT, please recite the 12 days of Christmas.
[33:41.60]Yeah, it would give you something crazy.
[33:43.91]Well, not anymore, but maybe like three or four years ago, you'd get something crazy.
[34:02.60]The purple flowers are very pretty.
[34:05.43]Yeah, Terrace Fall is pretty.
[34:09.41]It's a little dreary, though.
[34:11.15]It's a little too drab.
[34:12.09]I mean, we are undead.
[34:15.49]I get it, but it's a little dreary for me.
[34:18.17]I do like the foliage.
[34:21.97]Where is this?
[34:24.39]Oh, I'm kind of going through the back door here.
[34:32.62]How come my Voidwalker can do that, but I can't?
[34:37.18]Oh, whatever.
[34:41.88]Oops.
[34:46.00]Better than Durotar, the whole zone is just red.
[34:47.90]Yeah, Durotar is a just bright orange juice orange, isn't it?
[34:56.63]It's like orange red.
[35:00.44]And even if you turn the brightness of your monitor down, it doesn't even matter.
[35:03.86]It's still so bright.
[35:15.20]We want to do this together?
[35:24.45]Killing the same stuff, right?
[35:34.40]Durotar is beautiful on a CRT.
[35:46.33]Probably is really awesome looking on a hold monitor, isn't it?
[35:57.11]Separate group.
[36:03.38]Should we combine into one group?
[36:10.90]Hey, this game is too confusing.
[36:12.12]Are you good?
[36:13.84]Can you put an older stream VOD on in the background so we can watch a different stream?
[36:18.99]You could also not watch this one and go watch whatever VOD you want.
[36:22.57]I've got like 4,000 VODs.
[36:25.83]Here's the beauty of that.
[36:26.49]You can decide whatever you want to watch.
[36:30.21]That's the beauty of that.
[36:39.93]Dude, you could right now put a Cathy Mitchell infomercial on a different screen or something.
[36:45.13]That's fucking awesome.
[36:58.00]Alright, we got the captain.
[37:00.94]We still need Friars.
[37:06.38]You gotta put Minecraft Parkour in the corner.
[37:11.47]No, because then when you start appeasing to put Minecraft in the corner, that's all they're ever gonna want.
[37:28.22]What the fuck?
[37:29.82]Oh my god, get in there.
[37:30.56]Should I fear one?
[37:38.95]You good?
[37:41.43]Oh, there's like 10 people here.
[37:42.49]Never mind.
[37:55.39]You gotta be the Minecraft corner guy.
[38:03.65]Your computer can load more than one video at a time.
[38:06.20]Oh, you got Otto the dog in here.
[38:09.90]I don't think he knows that Otto the dog is... I don't think Otto... Is Otto the dog even on this quest?
[38:19.21]I would be shocked.
[38:20.01]Oh, he's level 10.
[38:26.94]Oh, shit.
[38:50.39]There we go.
[39:00.01]Okay.
[39:01.35]Alright, thank you.
[39:02.05]Enjoy the rest of your adventuring.
[39:05.32]Uh... Spider venom.
[39:18.12]Where does life tap?
[39:21.61]Is Lifetap not on my bar?
[39:23.01]Oh my God, that's embarrassing.
[39:25.03]Oh shit.
[39:26.01]Pretend like nobody saw this.
[39:37.71]That's a bad place for that to be too.
[39:39.21]How about right there?
[39:49.47]Saw what exactly?
[40:05.40]I think that felt maybe better.
[40:18.07]Did this game die eight years ago?
[40:22.69]World of Warcraft has kind of just perpetually been existing and it keeps being revitalized every, I'd say every year or two.
[40:33.38]I'm all for it though because
[40:37.86]I do think this is one of the best games of all time.
[40:42.82]So I'm glad to be playing it.
[40:44.60]I'm happy to be playing it.
[40:45.46]Alright, let's get this.
[40:52.79]Let's speed run this.
[40:57.23]Yeah, this is also hardcore.
[41:02.15]Oh, I got to turn off the thing so I can get into the guild.
[41:10.83]Where is that?
[41:17.13]Block guild invites.
[41:19.11]Okay.
[41:19.75]So I probably should wait.
[41:20.49]I should... How about this?
[41:22.51]You guys tell me when I'm going to get invited and I'll turn it off.
[41:28.43]Oh, I don't have any add-ons either.
[41:29.71]I have to get all the fucking add-ons.
[41:34.12]I don't have anything.
[41:49.74]okay can this work like like like a like a getting a degree without going to the college do you know what I mean I could he said oh and we're going to give Jerma an honorary only fangs membership
[42:16.25]And then in like a day or two, I can get everything set up.
[42:28.88]Actually, I want a shard.
[42:29.56]Okay.
[42:35.96]How do I already have a full inventory?
[42:37.80]What the fuck is going on?
[42:43.12]Wait, this is probably worth money.
[42:45.88]Uh, I got some new stuff.
[42:53.69]Oh, get this on the bar too.
[43:01.39]Okay.
[43:01.63]That is better.
[43:02.10]There we go.
[43:04.28]Alright.
[43:04.68]Whatever.
[43:13.67]Oh my god, I didn't know you streamed on Twitch.
[43:17.85]Oh, what's up?
[43:22.99]This is my first stream ever.
[43:27.22]You didn't miss anything.
[43:30.12]That last Spider-Man video from 2017 is the last time I did anything.
[43:40.97]Like recording or anything.
[43:48.90]always check your surroundings welcome back
[44:26.85]So once I get into the guild, what do I do to contribute?
[44:29.76]What should I do?
[44:45.27]You need to be the guild jester.
[44:47.39]No, I ain't doing that either.
[44:52.02]Guys, I'm not even going to make this.
[44:53.42]Okay.
[44:54.40]I'm not saying that because just in case that guy eats his dinner through his ass, I'm not going to say I'm not going to make it.
[45:00.03]Right?
[45:00.29]Like I got to be, wait, let's hold on here.
[45:08.39]Uh, I'm very, I'm a very slow leveler.
[45:14.72]I would be surprised if I got to like 40 in the next like two weeks.
[45:27.10]Oh shit, a level 60.
[45:55.57]I can't carry anymore.
[46:13.36]You should be the chief creative officer of Only Fangs.
[46:46.51]Nah, if I were to... I'm probably just going to join it.
[46:49.77]A lot of cool people in it.
[46:52.67]Easy to do dungeons.
[46:55.75]And there's that whole network of people to do the high-level stuff with.
[47:00.52]I know quite a few people in it already, so... Why not?
[47:11.36]I need two more spider...
[47:19.63]Yeah, Poke died.
[47:20.35]Poke died.
[47:21.33]Unfortunately, he died in the first raid.
[47:25.27]They got to Onyxia and he got aggro somehow and was tanking Onyxia for about one to two straight minutes.
[47:32.64]It was crazy.
[47:33.52]It was unbelievable that he died.
[47:36.32]Unbelievable that he lived as long as he did.
[47:41.78]He was the first to die in one of the raids, yeah.
[47:44.60]I think somebody else died in that raid too, wasn't there two or three?
[47:55.32]Yeah, I think he had more damage taken than the tank in the encounter.
[48:04.33]Which, I mean, if that's a way to go out, that's quite a way to go out.
[48:17.87]What a great ending to an arc.
[48:21.09]I made it all the way, I got to the first raid, and I tanked Onyxia as a fucking priest.
[48:25.95]And we killed it.
[48:34.96]You see how Tyler went out?
[48:35.90]Yeah.
[48:39.48]It was so close.
[48:40.46]It was so close.
[48:45.35]That fight is terrifying though.
[48:47.70]But yeah.
[48:54.97]Everyone just like it was fucking crazy.
[49:14.39]Would you have stayed in?
[49:15.42]Yeah.
[49:18.00]And I would have stayed in because I would have been so embarrassed that I was like number 30 on the DPS meter that I would rather be dead in the game.
[49:27.52]And because everybody else was running away, I would have an opportunity to get like two or three places up on that meter.
[49:33.55]So then it's like, oh, fuck, I'm so low, but no one's attacking right now.
[49:36.65]I could probably get like up three or four spots.
[49:39.27]That would be worth it for me to die there.
[49:40.65]So then people go, oh, wait, Jerma, what the fuck?
[49:42.75]Oh, no, Jerma, you did alright.
[49:43.85]What were you, 22, 23 on DPS?
[49:44.75]Cool.
[49:44.95]Alright, man.
[49:48.27]I'm just glad to hear that from anybody.
[49:50.96]Like, everybody opening up that log and being like, wait a minute.
[49:54.96]No, he did okay.
[49:55.86]Oh, and he died too.
[49:56.80]Fuck.
[50:03.70]I have such so much bullshit.
[50:08.25]His accolades.
[50:11.93]Guys, I might have died if I was in that raid.
[50:14.43]I may have died early on in that fight.
[50:21.88]I get so nervous in raids and dungeons and shit, especially on stream.
[50:30.79]But I would just be spamming shadow bolts.
[50:32.41]I would pop all cooldowns and just try to get two or three spots up on the meter so so people could make fun of how bad I was at the game.
[50:48.88]Where are the spiders?
[51:17.12]Do you have arachnophobia mode turned on?
[51:19.56]Um... I don't think that's in Classic.
[51:21.48]I think that's only in... That's in Retail, right?
[51:26.53]Doesn't it make them crabs or something, too?
[51:32.13]I almost think they look scarier as the crabs.
[51:35.19]I mean, I don't have arachnophobia, but, like, the replacements almost look even, like, stranger and scarier.
[51:49.41]Alright, I got them all.
[51:51.59]Let's turn that in.
[52:10.62]Coconut crabs are fucked up and scary.
[52:12.58]No, they are.
[52:22.50]So there's so many wild.
[52:25.13]Just what a wild looking animal.
[52:29.25]Oh my God, this is leather, what?
[52:33.17]We sell for a lot.
[52:38.80]I don't need a soul shard right now.
[52:58.28]I love invertebrates.
[53:04.14]Is it invertebrate or invertebrate?
[53:20.30]We should leave general chat.
[53:23.32]Once I hop in the guild, I'll hold on a second here.
[53:42.97]We're good.
[53:45.21]We're good.
[53:51.34]What do I do?
[53:51.82]Do I just go like this and just leave it?
[53:57.91]Oh, wait.
[53:58.23]I can just do this, right?
[54:02.59]Do I just leave it?
[54:03.63]Global.
[54:04.17]Oh, here we go.
[54:04.83]General.
[54:06.31]Local defense.
[54:10.63]Okay.
[54:15.58]Yeah, imagine once I join the guild.
[54:17.90]The guild channel.
[54:18.58]Oh my god.
[54:19.26]That's a level fucking 10.
[54:20.20]No, it's not.
[54:23.64]Do slash reload?
[54:34.47]What are your goals for this character?
[54:35.67]My goal for this character is to get to... At the very least, I want to get through level like 30.
[54:42.23]I think hitting level 30 is my 60.
[54:44.55]Wait, is reload?
[54:49.49]What the?
[54:50.03]Oh, right.
[54:50.33]You can reload your whole UI.
[54:51.91]Oh my God.
[54:52.62]What if I get attacked?
[55:01.60]You could like die doing that, can't you?
[55:02.87]I had a dream that you worked at Trader Joe's part time.
[55:29.38]Oh, I need that.
[55:29.88]Yeah.
[55:30.20]Thanks for the backseat.
[55:30.92]Alright.
[55:31.91]Backseating is not allowed unless I pick out the one person that gave one something very helpful and I say thank you.
[55:43.89]We're not going that way.
[55:58.87]Yeah, backseating is not allowed unless I allow it temporarily.
[56:01.09]Alright, get me out of here.
[56:09.80]I got to go to that island and then I'll be level 12 after this.
[56:16.40]What is Ragefire?
[56:18.15]13.
[56:18.17]Alright, I definitely should be at least 15.
[56:30.90]You gotta do the top-down technique.
[56:32.78]Just stay out of aggro range, and you can see everything around you in aggro range.
[56:47.03]Oh, by the way, what I'm doing is incredibly stupid.
[56:51.37]I should just get on the road.
[57:01.77]Okay, I'm safe right here.
[57:02.95]I'm gonna get two things here, but it's fine.
[57:05.47]Voidwalker will get both.
[57:15.17]Okay.
[57:31.74]Voidwalker is so good.
[57:36.66]These things are worth money.
[57:45.58]Is it true you soloed the Lich King?
[57:47.46]I did.
[57:49.88]I got to level 100.
[57:51.80]And then I went back to Northrend.
[57:58.25]And I killed him in three swings.
[58:16.89]Alright, get me back on the road.
[58:24.09]Trying to avoid all this.
[58:25.13]I'm getting experience, so it's fine.
[58:44.21]Can you explain wow to your handlers back on the mothership?
[58:47.25]Oh, shit.
[58:47.69]You're right.
[58:48.57]Sorry.
[58:48.93]Sometimes I forget.
[58:49.51]I'm getting a transmission.
[59:16.63]I got to roughly translate this.
[59:23.65]Put block break block game corner.
[59:29.54]Break block game corner.
[59:31.24]I don't know.
[59:55.28]Alright, let's do a big turn in.
[59:58.50]And then it's time to go to Silverpine and die to Son of Argil.
[60:01.31]Because I don't know where he is and I don't know what his, uh... trajectory is.
[60:08.05]Or his route, his path, whatever.
[60:24.87]Do you guys think that aliens are real?
[60:27.81]Do you guys think that they are alien?
[60:30.97]I don't know.
[60:34.05]Maybe.
[60:40.90]I hope they're nice.
[60:42.62]I hope they're cool.
[60:54.82]Alright, give me this book and then I'm going to get up and stretch and kill the pre-rolls again.
[61:00.28]Where is my hearthstone set to?
[61:09.81]Shadow Grave?
[61:10.83]Oh, that's far away.
[61:21.44]There's people here.
[61:33.13]Obtain a candle of beckoning.
[61:35.61]What level is this thing?
[61:36.39]I'm not doing that right now.
[61:43.58]I want to turn these in.
[61:59.92]Stack of water?
[62:01.09]That would be amazing.
[62:02.85]But... I want to turn this shit in.
[62:18.23]I would love a stack of water.
[62:20.06]I have too much shit in my bags, though.
[62:27.40]Thank you so much.
[62:31.06]Alright, let me turn this in.
[62:32.34]I want to get up.
[62:36.69]Who shit in the bag?
[62:42.89]You have 64 waters now.
[62:45.34]Wait, do I have that much?
[62:47.28]That's too much, right?
[63:15.03]Alright, I'm going to go BRB.
[63:16.59]Run into the town here.
[63:19.51]Get up and stretch.
[63:20.11]Get a snack.
[63:20.75]I will come back.
[63:23.73]See you guys very soon.
[63:25.19]I'm safe right here.
[63:33.79]I will be right back.
[63:39.59]Put the music on?
[63:42.15]I won't forget.
[63:42.61]Don't worry.
[66:05.48]Thanks for watching!
[68:07.14]Alright, just sat back down.
[68:08.20]Hello.
[68:09.08]So when I get up, I do this thing where I bring my knees up to my chest.
[68:16.87]I'm going to do like big long walking.
[68:21.11]And I kind of squat down five to ten times.
[68:30.68]I do yoga.
[68:32.80]Alright, what was I doing?
[68:33.56]Alright, we're turning this stuff in.
[68:40.29]You're doing mom squats.
[68:44.78]Whatever, that's fine.
[68:46.26]We just need to get the blood moving a little.
[68:56.60]Executor Zygand in the town of Brill wants you to assassinate Captain Melrach and his two bodyguards.
[69:04.89]You'll be able to choose between the ceremonial knife or the striking hatchet.
[69:20.64]Alright, level 12.
[69:21.34]I need new abilities, please.
[69:34.24]Ooh.
[69:37.10]220 experience for that?
[69:38.18]That was crap.
[69:41.57]That was a pain in the ass to get that.
[69:45.29]You gave me a fucking blue ribbon?
[69:53.05]I gotta sell all this crap.
[70:05.39]I am forsaken.
[70:09.17]I was just sold this and I was just like, sell set.
[70:13.95]Yup.
[70:14.15]Oh, wait a minute.
[70:15.03]This was a gift.
[70:16.31]You can't sell a gift.
[70:17.77]You can't sell a gift, um, for at least a week.
[70:21.71]And I wasn't going to sell it.
[70:31.40]Oh, that's worse.
[70:47.85]I'm getting close to half of one gold.
[70:50.27]That's kind of good, isn't it?
[70:57.64]These bags are a disaster.
[70:58.74]I'm putting consumables in here.
[71:00.04]And then... I got a lot of healing potions.
[71:20.42]I've been playing so good, I don't even need to use one.
[71:27.24]I gotta go learn Stabs.
[71:28.70]Did you guys tell me this before?
[71:29.84]Where do you learn Stabs?
[71:36.10]Too much water?
[71:40.34]Yeah, I do have a little bit too much.
[71:42.19]I bought these, though.
[71:44.29]I'm gonna keep these, because I'll just go through these ones.
[71:47.53]Because these ones disappear if you log out.
[71:54.01]It's in Thunder Bluff.
[71:54.61]Okay.
[71:56.01]Oh my God.
[71:56.55]Thunder Bluff.
[71:56.95]It may as well be in a different continent.
[72:02.13]It is in a different continent.
[72:03.71]I mean, whatever.
[72:28.29]At least the Horde of Zeppelins.
[72:29.43]Yeah.
[72:35.31]Oh, it is close.
[72:36.09]That's what it is.
[72:37.03]It is close.
[72:37.61]Never mind.
[72:37.97]It's the Zeppelin right here.
[72:40.09]I don't know why I thought I had to go to Silverpine for that when I've played this game many times.
[72:48.13]Well, okay.
[72:49.73]Alright.
[72:52.61]I want to go learn that.
[72:53.31]We're going to go to Orgrimmar.
[72:54.85]How did I not hit 12 from that?
[72:56.15]That's such...
[72:57.90]Bullshit.
[73:12.80]I think actually might hit.
[73:15.66]This is two parter.
[73:16.44]So I'll get all the experience at this leg of the chain, OK?
[73:24.21]How many hours do you have in classic total over the last 25 years or just in the last week or two, you mean?
[73:30.87]Over the last 25 years, I don't know.
[73:33.17]It's an amount that I kind of don't want to know.
[73:35.52]I think he's downstairs, yeah.
[73:42.80]I think total slash played across every character I've ever had has to be at least, it has to be a year, like a full year in game, at least.
[73:54.76]Poisoning this guy on purpose.
[74:38.49]Watching you play this proves that I would watch anything you would do.
[74:43.70]Alright.
[74:48.69]We're just chilling.
[74:50.81]I love this game.
[74:51.41]It's like one of my favorite games ever and I'm just gonna play it and I'm just gonna stream it and we're just gonna chill.
[75:13.06]Actually, I'd get this love to maxed out first.
[75:15.24]Yeah.
[75:16.80]So now this is 12% damage.
[75:23.87]It's kind of a lot.
[75:26.53]This maxes out a 20% damage increase.
[75:29.63]If you get a crit with shadow bolt, that's insane.
[75:52.32]You could stare at a blank wall and I would watch it.
[75:54.12]I just got money.
[76:02.79]I would hope you wouldn't.
[76:05.36]I would hope that after 40 minutes or so, you'd just be like, this is kind of boring.
[76:08.78]I'm just going to go to something else.
[76:20.41]I think 40 minutes is a reasonable time.
[76:22.65]Well, 44 minutes, because that's an episode of television on TV.
[76:27.05]That's a one hour television episode.
[76:29.69]If something doesn't happen on a stream like that in one hour of television, then you could probably just leave.
[76:39.81]That means nothing's happening.
[76:46.78]Alright.
[76:48.91]I could do... This is a daily?
[76:58.11]I really don't want to go all the way up there.
[76:59.55]Is it... It's part of the chain, but is it worth it?
[77:04.22]Not really.
[77:04.68]I think I'm just going to go to Sailor Fine.
[77:11.94]Or I might go to the Barrens.
[77:17.06]Okay.
[77:18.89]What is worse?
[77:19.85]Is Silverpine?
[77:20.69]I think Silverpine is more dangerous than the Barrens, even though the Barrens is horrifying.
[77:33.49]Barrens early is worse.
[77:37.03]Silverpine is better.
[77:38.79]I think I'm going to go to the Barrens.
[77:40.35]I am going to get killed by the Son of Argo.
[77:41.83]I don't know where he is.
[77:43.93]I know he's like here with all the other worgens, but
[77:49.66]I'm afraid I'm not going to know what his pathing is.
[77:51.82]I think there's two or three of them.
[77:56.20]Level 12 is good for the Barons.
[77:58.48]Yeah, let's go to the Barons.
[77:59.36]I'm not messing around with the Son of Aragul.
[78:07.39]Barons at 12 is kind of spooky on hardcore.
[78:12.37]Yeah, but at least those first handful of missions are... Kill the Planestriders, right?
[78:19.72]That's easy.
[78:20.48]I can do that.
[78:24.74]Where's the Zeppelin up there?
[78:33.82]You could do some Durotar as well.
[78:35.20]That's true.
[78:37.80]On the flight over, I will figure it out.
[78:43.10]I need to level up some Warlock abilities, though.
[78:53.04]No, I'm not against add-ons.
[78:54.52]I like the ones that I have.
[78:58.63]And if I join Only Fangs, I would probably have to get the Only Fangs stuff.
[79:06.91]But what you see is what I will be using.
[79:12.56]With the exception of maybe a... What, like a DBM or something, right?
[79:20.33]If I ever, for some reason, get into a high-level dungeon, which I doubt it.
[79:28.61]I got damage meters.
[79:30.41]I have damage meters and threat meters.
[79:34.81]See?
[79:38.04]I just have to activate the threat meter.
[79:42.28]But at level 10, you're not really... There's not much to look at.
[80:02.28]You need to make that longer so we can see when you get bottom DPS.
[80:11.15]Wow, six people think I'm going to.
[80:13.40]I mean 14 is.
[80:13.92]How?
[80:17.94]Early Barrens is scary.
[80:22.63]And this is where.
[80:24.91]Those moments of weighty actually might die.
[80:28.40]Those happen here.
[80:34.63]Alright, now the real joke would be to miss the Zeppelin here and die here.
[80:38.43]Walk off the edge right now and die.
[80:40.49]And then just go play Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
[80:51.81]We're not dying.
[80:54.43]I am going to live for at least a while.
[81:09.88]That channel point payout would be massive.
[81:26.94]You know, how come the warlock doesn't have a thing where you can go into the eyes of your pet like the hunter does?
[81:32.58]Because then you can test all kinds of weird bullshit.
[81:44.14]Eye of Kilrog.
[81:45.06]Yeah, Eye of Kilrog is a little... I'm talking about like walk around and attack and fight.
[81:49.75]I don't think that Eye of Kilrog can do anything besides float around.
[82:01.92]Somebody just fell?
[82:06.24]I don't think falling from here is lethal.
[82:09.08]I think it takes you down to about 10%.
[82:19.89]Test it.
[82:24.40]I'm not gonna be the one to test it, no.
[82:38.27]Priest can kill you if you jump, how?
[82:51.68]to get a good view there we go it's going it's going look that's crazy this is kind of what it looked like uh in the hot air balloon
[83:18.59]It got to a point sometimes where you really felt like we're going to hit these fucking trees.
[83:23.67]And then you were like, no, wait, we're not.
[83:25.04]And then you go a little bit higher.
[83:41.99]Okay.
[83:43.01]That almost was a complete disaster because I was trying to do slash dance.
[83:49.03]But I have this on.
[83:52.23]Wait, no, was it working?
[83:53.44]I don't know.
[83:55.56]I'm not going to move though.
[83:56.32]That's scary.
[84:00.13]Oh, here we go.
[84:01.33]Here it is.
[84:01.73]The fucking orange Kool-Aid zone.
[84:21.15]It looks like tomato soup.
[84:31.37]I'm taking the stairs.
[84:32.33]Did that guy die?
[84:47.08]Uh, I don't, I don't think it's lethal.
[84:48.48]I think you're, I think it's fine.
[84:51.44]What level is all this stuff?
[84:57.59]I could do these.
[84:58.71]These are all 9, 10, 11.
[85:00.23]Maybe I should just do Razor Hill for a little while.
[85:06.98]Barrens is 12 to 15.
[85:08.60]I would be right on the edge of minimum level viability.
[85:22.38]Are you 40 feet from your monitor?
[85:24.20]Why is everything so big?
[85:25.20]I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to make like a chat command to tell people that I like big icons.
[85:46.69]I got to learn staffs.
[85:52.28]Weapon master, right?
[85:56.90]Oh no, that's Thunder Bluff.
[85:58.24]It's wrong, but I can get to Thunder Bluff from I gotta run to Thunder Bluff.
[86:02.15]That's a pain in the ass.
[86:05.97]Do I have to go?
[86:08.53]Uhm?
[86:10.81]Wait a minute.
[86:14.97]This this is stabbed.
[86:17.61]Oh.
[86:23.37]Okay.
[86:38.20]You're in permadeath.
[86:38.90]This is permadeath.
[86:46.50]Welcome to Orgrimmar.
[86:47.34]Uh...
[86:53.13]I would say I like Thunder Bluff better than Orgrimmar, but Orgrimmar is the capital city of the Horde.
[87:03.94]Okay, where is this Weapon Master?
[87:05.20]All the way up here?
[87:07.29]Yep.
[87:15.77]When are you going to do your 10,000 calorie McDonald's mukbang stream?
[87:23.02]Well, I would do a 10,000 calorie McDonald's mukbang stream over a month.
[87:42.07]100 McNugget challenge.
[87:44.70]Yeah, we all know you're a hunter.
[87:46.06]We know you're a hunter.
[87:48.64]We all know you're a hunter.
[87:51.82]Good try, though.
[88:01.56]I don't think I could eat 100 nuggets right now.
[88:04.14]I really don't.
[88:22.86]I could probably do... 20?
[88:23.94]Or maybe 40?
[88:34.05]I could probably do 50.
[88:35.65]But once you cross 50, that's throw up territory for me.
[88:44.05]You guys got to remember, I'm not 25 anymore.
[88:48.13]I'm not 20.
[88:48.77]That hits a lot different when you're in your late 30s into your early 40s.
[89:00.39]You can't really do the 100 McNugget challenge anymore.
[89:07.43]Where are you?
[89:09.57]There you are.
[89:11.87]Ten silver.
[89:12.65]Fine.
[89:17.84]Put that staff on.
[89:20.98]Oh wait, I gotta take both these off.
[89:25.04]I think the three stamina is always gonna be better though.
[89:29.42]This thing looks like a piece of crap.
[89:36.19]This thing looks like it's made out of chocolate.
[89:39.61]I have my candy staff!
[89:41.53]And I'm dressed like a fucking candy man!
[89:43.19]Why are we making chocolates?
[89:50.84]Willy Wonka.
[89:55.20]Ah yes, Willy Wonka's weird fucking creepy cousin.
[89:59.20]Chaos Chris!
[90:02.61]He uses dark chocolate.
[90:06.15]80% cocoa.
[90:12.77]It's devilish.
[90:20.78]Cool.
[90:21.00]Well, I get extra... What'd I get?
[90:23.56]Oh, damn.
[90:23.94]Look at that health increase.
[90:40.52]I should probably make my hearth here.
[90:42.80]It kind of is the central hub of everything.
[90:55.35]I gotta buy new ranks too.
[91:02.81]Hopefully I have enough money.
[91:03.61]Are you an Orgrimmar?
[91:24.11]Are we going to get the buff?
[91:30.54]Kiss the goblin for health.
[91:32.60]Where?
[91:40.66]By thrall.
[91:41.90]Wait, what?
[91:44.92]Where is thrall?
[91:48.97]Oh, there he is.
[92:02.93]Let me see if I got room.
[92:05.81]Oh, you got the RFC quest.
[92:06.93]Cool.
[92:09.01]There's a, there's one down here, right?
[92:10.90]There's a chain you have to do.
[92:11.90]I remember this.
[92:12.54]You have to, you've got to go kill some cultist people to get an orb or something.
[92:19.44]I get in there.
[92:29.01]Didn't take you for a goblin.
[92:30.39]If I could play a goblin, that's what I would be.
[92:32.35]I'm actually upset that goblins are not in Classic.
[92:36.92]It... Yeah, we had to wait an expansion for it.
[92:40.88]But... And that's what's going to be really, really difficult for me.
[92:48.20]Is... I don't know... Playing Horde, I don't like playing Horde, but I love goblins.
[92:56.36]And I'm willing to play on Horde to play a goblin.
[93:00.26]The problem is, is that I would want to play Alliance too.
[93:08.75]So if TBC comes out and people want to play it or do it, it's going to be tough for me because, oh shit, I want to do that.
[93:18.83]I want to play a goblin.
[93:20.65]But I fucking hate all the Horde cities and all like the Horde stuff.
[93:24.95]Yeah, this is for, alright, okay, RFC.
[93:37.56]Oh wait, that's Blood Elves, that's right.
[93:39.88]Was it Wrath?
[93:40.52]No, it was Cataclysm for Goblins.
[93:42.69]Shit, I got this all wrong.
[93:46.63]That's right, that's when Goblins decided to enter the fray, right?
[93:55.03]Oh shit, I'd be playing Alliance then.
[94:03.16]There it is.
[94:05.64]We're just bolting.
[94:09.66]Rank three bolt.
[94:11.28]Was that 2632?
[94:11.54]Yep.
[94:11.76]Nice.
[94:11.90]This is good.
[94:19.02]It's a pet heal.
[94:25.44]You give off strong gnome vibes.
[94:30.16]Um.
[94:32.40]Yeah, I mean, I feel like that's the thing everyone would want me to pick.
[94:37.96]I don't think so, though.
[94:39.33]I don't think so.
[94:44.99]I would say I'm a goblin.
[94:46.23]Goblin versus gnome?
[94:47.45]No, fuck the gnomes.
[94:49.13]Really?
[94:50.55]I'm definitely a goblin in every single conceivable way.
[94:58.69]Gnomes are inquisitive and they like to do engineering and they very much enjoy doing math problems and sitting around drinking coffee.
[95:07.96]I wanted the goblins.
[95:09.26]I want to sit around and smoke cigarettes.
[95:11.74]And like eat fucking Doritos.
[95:14.01]And put a bunch of chemicals in a fucking soup and see if it explodes.
[95:21.05]And have like an illegal blackjack ring going in behind the potion shop.
[95:42.25]You're a blood elf who runs with goblins.
[95:48.03]I'm a blood elf at all.
[95:49.17]I have all of my friends are goblins.
[95:50.99]Is that what you're saying?
[96:03.90]Half goblin, half blood elf.
[96:11.02]What would that even be?
[96:12.60]That would be so crazy.
[96:21.26]Blood Elf is boring.
[96:22.58]I actually... Okay, Blood Elves are very clean.
[96:27.41]They moisturize their skin and they put product in their hair.
[96:30.47]Uh-oh.
[96:31.81]I actually might be a Blood Elf.
[96:38.32]And they're obsessed with magic and energy, and they're, like, addicted to magic.
[96:41.68]Uh-oh.
[96:50.26]Do the Taurens moisturize?
[96:55.19]Do orcs have, like, a skincare regimen, do you think?
[96:59.55]Definitely not.
[97:02.85]Well, that looks like I'd have to make a blood elf.
[97:08.37]OK, these new ranks up.
[97:21.19]Rank 3.
[97:23.35]Curse of weakness 2.
[97:25.87]Curse of weakness is actually pretty good.
[97:38.18]Do I look down on everybody?
[97:46.83]Blood elves are very, very conceited, right?
[97:48.97]The narcissism and... Am I a snob?
[97:57.81]I don't think I'm a snob.
[97:58.75]Well, that would be my goblin instincts, right?
[98:09.47]OK, so I got my wait.
[98:17.32]Where's the demon trainer?
[98:21.52]What can I help you with?
[98:22.50]I already got these.
[98:26.75]Oh here we go phase shift.
[98:29.91]That's for the imp.
[98:33.21]OK.
[98:50.89]What does phase shift even do?
[98:53.11]Makes them untargetable?
[99:00.90]Yeah, it's all good.
[99:01.82]I'll take whatever you got.
[99:09.50]Is that just like for PvP?
[99:29.29]Okay.
[99:34.89]Hidden enemies is skull.
[99:35.87]Yeah, skull.
[99:36.39]That's the one where you gotta... In here, right?
[99:42.76]It's right out the door.
[99:44.58]Yeah, let's go do it.
[99:53.37]We could hop on a call, too, if you feel like it.
[99:56.45]Or if you just want to chill and just quest, I'm down for that, too.
[100:00.36]Alright, let me make this my... Let me put this as my home.
[100:21.78]Give her to trade chat.
[100:24.47]Uh, it'll only be up when I'm in a major city.
[100:26.55]I'll move it in a little bit.
[100:36.65]Yeah, let me, let me just grab my, uh, I would have to do a little bit of moving, moving some stuff around.
[100:46.17]Cause I want you to be coming through headphones.
[100:55.73]So before we hop into, um, do a bunch of questing and stuff, maybe I can get it to move.
[101:02.55]You're doing speaker gaming?
[101:04.18]I actually am.
[101:05.94]And it's so much better.
[101:08.24]I've come to realize that having everything come through into my ears fries my brain.
[101:17.77]But the problem is it's so difficult.
[101:19.85]Whoa!
[101:20.67]Oh!
[101:25.37]uh it's so hard to stream while you have stuff come through the speakers because it just gets picked up so easily but I have apparently figured out the perfect solution in a way to make it so you guys can't hear that and it is completely life-changing it's been so much better oh wait I gotta go to thrall yeah
[101:57.51]So the speakers are pretty far away.
[102:01.29]And this microphone, I have the noise gate and the compressor is at a point where I have it close enough to my face, where it really is only picking up what's like right in front of my mouth.
[102:14.26]And you guys aren't getting the speakers that are five feet the other way.
[102:28.83]Is that the hearth too?
[102:29.59]Yeah, I will.
[102:33.57]I hate using headphones.
[102:35.69]Yeah, I don't know.
[102:36.63]I've probably got some... I don't know.
[102:40.47]I'm very particular about it.
[102:44.29]Having both my ears covered, I can't hear anything and I can't hear myself talk.
[102:48.14]So it's almost like you can't talk.
[102:51.62]And then I was like, get the open-ear headphones.
[102:53.58]You know what's fucked up?
[102:54.64]Listen to this.
[102:56.26]What is going on with the quality of products?
[102:59.26]I feel like there's so much cheap products out there that headphones sound so much worse than they did 10 years ago.
[103:09.78]There's so many products, it's just like, just mass-produced products, mass-produced products of headphones, headphones.
[103:15.21]You'll buy a pair of headphones, like, oh, these look nice, maybe these are good.
[103:19.13]And it's like the free headphones they give you on the airplane sometimes.
[103:24.51]And sometimes you gotta pay like fucking five bucks for those.
[103:28.46]Why are all headphones now airplane-quality headphones?
[103:32.66]What the fuck is going on?
[103:39.19]It's gotten so much worse.
[103:42.77]And then, but the good ones, well, then just get the really good ones.
[103:46.81]The big ear muffs and it's incredible sound quality.
[103:50.15]I hate those things.
[103:52.13]I, it's like, I feel like I'm in like an air traffic controller.
[103:54.84]It's like, I can't hear anything.
[103:56.02]It's like pressure in my ears.
[103:57.28]I, I hate those things.
[104:02.14]Alright.
[104:03.18]Where's the goblin?
[104:03.88]Oh, there we go.
[104:08.46]Okay, he gave me a kiss.
[104:13.94]Oh, I have to do it.
[104:21.33]Oh my god, that's fucking crazy.
[104:27.47]That's almost a 100% HP increase doing that.
[104:37.70]Get in early monitors.
[104:41.67]You know, Bose, Bose used to make these awesome headphones.
[104:46.64]They were, and I finally, the last pair I had for almost 10 years, they finally shit the bed.
[104:54.73]Bose made these in-ear, they were in-ear earbuds.
[104:59.11]And they had this kind of transparent gel that was really comfortable.
[105:03.57]It fit in your ears.
[105:05.37]It got in there.
[105:06.54]The sound quality was great.
[105:08.54]It was wonderful.
[105:10.50]It was actually wonderful.
[105:11.62]And like, I know Bose, it's like a 500% premium.
[105:15.68]But at some point, man, those were the only fucking good ones.
[105:21.08]I could, nobody makes shit like that anymore.
[105:27.01]I've tried to find, and all these, all these companies come up with, well, you see, it's a Bluetooth connection and you have to like, like sync it to the, and they're wireless.
[105:34.15]Give me a, oh my God, give me a wired head, earbuds that are really nice, really high quality and they're comfortable.
[105:43.90]I don't want to have like an app on my phone to control the headphones that I have.
[105:51.52]Give me a just headphone Jack that works and sounds good.
[105:57.01]That's not a boomer take.
[105:57.89]It is not.
[105:58.81]No, it's not.
[105:59.89]No way.
[106:00.39]Because Bluetooth has like a 0.3 second delay.
[106:03.65]So if you are connecting to something and you're listening through Bluetooth and you need it to be a certain millisecond, sometimes things will happen.
[106:11.14]It's like a noticeable millisecond behind it.
[106:20.14]Give me the wire and make it a long wire.
[106:22.90]Make it a good long wire that can be plugged in.
[106:27.68]It can be cable tied.
[106:29.10]And then you get those in your ears, make them comfortable.
[106:33.57]I'd pay $200 for those.
[106:35.71]I would.
[106:36.99]Because people pay $200, $300 for the super bulky, really good, high quality ones.
[106:46.02]Oh, wait, I didn't make this my home.
[106:50.83]It's right here.
[106:54.79]I don't like the wire.
[106:55.61]And you lose them.
[106:56.45]It's so easy to lose.
[106:57.37]Oh, here's my little quarter of an inch earbud.
[106:59.77]It just fell on the couch and it's gone forever.
[107:02.71]A wire.
[107:03.21]That shit gets tangled up in your hands.
[107:04.83]It gets all tied up.
[107:05.91]No, you can't lose them as easily.
[107:11.69]I almost just attacked this guy.
[107:19.21]Where's the innkeeper?
[107:22.60]There's so many people in this room.
[107:39.30]Bro, you're buying gas station earbuds every time.
[107:42.26]I'm telling you, I'm not.
[107:44.10]And here's the thing.
[107:45.66]I'm going to keep going because whatever.
[107:48.60]The ones that are good, the good earbuds that have a wire, those things have to be suction cup stuffed into your ears.
[107:59.33]It's like a suction cup stuffed in to get the good quality.
[108:08.25]These Bose headphones, they were light.
[108:12.21]They were comfortable.
[108:13.07]It was like, there was a little nice, cool gel pad on it.
[108:23.35]And they don't, I don't think they even make them anymore.
[108:25.21]I think they turned them into, they called them like, oh, we're going to make these the sport headphones.
[108:30.55]And then I'm not even sure they kept going.
[108:34.48]Go to the headphones subreddit for good research.
[108:44.82]I just don't like when I block out all the sound from the outside.
[108:51.03]And I like the lightness of an earbud.
[108:53.23]Because then you get the problem where you wear headphones or you have like, you know, what do they call them?
[108:58.81]The back, outer back flip earbuds where they're not hugged to your head and you can hear everything still, what are they called?
[109:05.94]The problem though is that hook that goes around your ear, after a long two, three, four hour session of kind of hanging out and listening to music or playing a game or watching TV or movies, your ear hurts.
[109:16.56]It's like, ow, yikes, it fucking hurts.
[109:23.18]We need better quality fucking earbuds.
[109:35.95]Uh, yeah, I never went to Razor Hill at all.
[109:38.25]You can get everything at Razor Hill too if you want.
[109:49.90]Watch out, watch out, watch out!
[109:50.96]Aggro, aggro!
[109:59.96]Shadow Bolt is three seconds now.
[110:04.25]I need this so bad.
[110:07.69]Yeah, Shadow Bolt is going up in cast time.
[110:10.10]I think it goes to three seconds eventually.
[110:12.32]That's so long.
[110:25.49]Apparently there are still Bose earbuds.
[110:27.84]Bose ultra open earbuds seem highly rated.
[110:30.98]I'll have to look into it, but they made the specific in ear.
[110:35.26]They looked like little like suction cups at the end and with a hook, a gel white hook.
[110:40.51]You probably have seen them on the stream a thousand times.
[110:42.59]It's the only set of headphones you've ever seen me put in.
[111:00.82]Did Etalyx make a new guy?
[111:01.94]I think so.
[111:06.00]Oh, I think this character is not in Only Fangs.
[111:09.50]Etalyx' other character is in Only Fangs.
[111:23.02]Let's go kill these guys.
[111:23.94]Let's go get the quest.
[111:25.14]I think by the time we do the quest... How far are you two...
[111:30.74]Uh, 13.
[111:37.12]Yeah, they looked like a little, it was like a little hole.
[111:40.22]40%, okay, go.
[111:42.78]They weren't, I hate the suction cup ones too.
[111:44.80]That's the ones I despise more than anything.
[111:47.50]Um, these, it just was like a little tube hole that fit in your ear.
[111:59.65]It almost looked like the end of like a little, like a doctor scope.
[112:02.97]It was like a little... Oh damn, somebody's died here.
[112:14.62]That's true.
[112:15.72]Alright, let me... Here, let's see if you come through.
[112:25.55]Give me one second.
[112:26.75]I gotta change a few settings on Discord.
[112:28.37]Discord.
[112:30.21]I don't think people will be able to hear you through the speakers.
[112:32.13]We'll find out though.
[112:42.13]I can always turn you down on my end too.
[112:44.51]Let's find out.
[112:54.96]Oops.
[113:10.26]Let's see.
[113:10.70]Hello there.
[113:19.66]Oh, I can't hear you.
[113:23.59]Talk again?
[113:26.39]Oh, there he is.
[113:27.43]Let me turn you up a little bit more.
[113:39.55]Alright, say your ABCs.
[113:43.41]A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P. I think you missed one, but you got most of them.
[113:49.91]That's pretty good.
[113:50.49]I think you would have got like an A or an A minus.
[113:51.90]Alright, now let me turn the game volume down a little because it'll be too loud.
[113:57.20]Okay.
[114:04.17]What's up?
[114:07.61]Are you on Push to Talk or are you on everything?
[114:12.59]I'm on just... Sorry about that loud sound.
[114:15.81]I did not hear a loud sound.
[114:20.64]Can you hear that?
[114:21.48]That's my coffee maker turning off.
[114:24.24]I did not hear anything.
[114:27.66]Okay.
[114:27.88]Is your coffee maker next to the microphone?
[114:30.02]I mean, it's kind of.
[114:35.94]Alright, so we are gonna... So you're in Only Fangs, but not on this character.
[114:41.08]Correct, yeah.
[114:41.89]I'm incognito.
[114:43.91]Soda tried to invite me last night, but I have auto-decline on, and I declined him like three times.
[114:50.13]I gotta get in touch.
[114:51.95]I think that's good, though, because it means you're in a position to make demands now.
[114:56.15]Like, if you just assert yourself, you gotta make him come to you.
[115:08.69]Dude, I'm gonna die at like level 18.
[115:10.07]I'm fucking dead soon.
[115:12.53]Oh yeah, I mean, we actually do have to be kind of careful in here.
[115:20.32]No, this place sucks.
[115:22.18]Don't... Well, I mean, someone was dead at the entrance.
[115:28.94]Wait, wait, wait.
[115:29.28]Actually, let me give you a health stone.
[115:33.74]Let's do it in this hallway where it's safe.
[115:38.74]We should probably invite this person, I'd imagine, right?
[115:44.03]Actually, we don't want to because we're trying to get loot.
[115:47.29]So there's like a drop.
[115:48.97]We gotta get the insignia.
[115:54.63]Wait, are we trading or?
[115:55.41]Trading, what do you mean?
[115:59.71]You just, you just one second ago said I'm going to give you a health stone.
[116:03.67]Oh, I need a, I need a soulstone card.
[116:06.83]I gotcha.
[116:10.41]I didn't forget, here we go.
[116:11.75]Oh my god, behind us!
[116:23.55]It's almost like he didn't even know what was going on.
[116:25.23]What is this, dynamite?
[116:31.98]Why can't we accept the trade?
[116:33.46]Alright, click the button!
[116:39.58]We're being attacked.
[116:41.96]The OK button is grayed out.
[116:44.17]Alright, so we just have to kill this shit till we get Insignia, right?
[116:49.69]Yeah, it's... It's going to be good XP.
[116:54.03]I'm good with that.
[117:00.78]Do you need any potions?
[117:03.08]Yeah, I got potions.
[117:03.92]Do you need some?
[117:06.00]No, I've got like two stacks.
[117:07.74]Yeah, I should be good.
[117:12.19]anyway the headphone thing yes you you get that too don't you yeah because in like 2014 or something you told me like 2015 you were like dude you got to get these Bose in-ear headphones it's they're the best in-ear headphones that exist and now they don't make them anymore right exactly and and even trying to find a comparable model
[117:37.71]Somebody at Bose cracked the code to make the best in-ear headphones ever.
[117:41.49]And then they just kind of were like, yeah, we're just not going to do that anymore.
[117:48.02]They make like a sport version now.
[117:49.74]It's like... With the little dongle on the side, like you were talking about.
[117:54.58]The little app dongle.
[117:58.75]Yeah, they're not the same.
[118:00.37]They're different.
[118:01.31]They're a little different, aren't they?
[118:02.81]Like everybody wants to be...
[118:06.51]Like just another... You know how many apps I have to delete on my old 10 year old phone every time I want to install one of these new shitty apps?
[118:15.54]Yeah, I'm sick of the apps.
[118:17.74]I'm sick of the apps.
[118:18.92]Like the apps are getting to be just fucking ludicrous.
[118:22.70]I don't want to download an app for every single product I buy.
[118:33.92]I got I got the you know, like the wireless lights.
[118:38.40]Well, they're not wireless.
[118:39.44]They plug into the wall, but like the Wi-Fi lights.
[118:44.35]Yeah, like the forward facing kind of.
[118:48.47]Like the.
[118:51.21]God, what brand is it Phillips?
[118:56.21]They don't work.
[119:01.81]Oh, this dude is level 14.
[119:03.19]Oh, somebody, oh no, somebody's in here fighting.
[119:07.57]Uh, we gotta help this dude, I think.
[119:08.98]Oh, wait, that's Gazuz.
[119:09.84]That's the guy we're not supposed to fight.
[119:12.36]We're not supposed to fight that guy?
[119:14.26]Because he's going to kick our ass.
[119:18.04]I think this level 16 is here, thank God.
[119:33.33]Maybe we should we should probably go back to the entrance or like a wrap around because then we'll get like stuck in here.
[119:48.02]But anyway, I got I got like six of the Phillips app lights and they did an update like six months ago and the app stopped working so I I couldn't turn them off or on without unplugging them and plugging them in manually.
[120:04.28]That's so annoying.
[120:05.90]It's just why does everything have to have an app?
[120:16.24]It's just so unnecessary.
[120:20.39]Is it for like data collection or is it too?
[120:24.79]Convenience to look if you have we have lights.
[120:27.95]Yeah, I don't know what it's even.
[120:29.21]It's just ridiculous.
[120:31.17]App equals data, yeah.
[120:49.97]This thing has a terrible drop rate, doesn't it?
[120:54.47]Probably, yeah.
[120:55.75]I actually got it on my Shaman on the first Burning Blade Fanatic I ever killed.
[121:03.98]Learn how to run your own home server.
[121:08.66]Like what, have my lights turn on and shit when I say, hey, lights turn on.
[121:14.80]Did anybody even do that?
[121:16.42]I remember like so many people and companies.
[121:20.02]Smart lights and smart this.
[121:21.43]I did the smart lighting thing for a little bit and it was kind of cool.
[121:23.61]You could control the color and the temperature of the light.
[121:27.99]But I think for some reason, we're still in that weird world of, oh, you want your curtains to go up automatically at 6 a.m.
[121:37.31]Nobody even cares.
[121:50.20]The clapper?
[121:51.50]Well, the clapper still required human input.
[122:04.05]Wanting your house to listen to you at all times is something.
[122:06.25]Yeah, that stuff too.
[122:08.28]I don't want that in the house either.
[122:10.24]Have you ever done the Alexa joke on stream?
[122:14.18]Uh, I mean, we've talked maybe some shit about those systems, but I don't want to look to hear how loud my diarrhea was.
[122:22.42]Like statistically right now, there's probably a large number of people that you could control their house right now.
[122:31.27]Who have you coming through the speakers?
[122:34.51]Oh, I see what you mean.
[122:35.33]Yeah.
[122:36.97]But then they have to, then, then they have to run and say, no, no, stop.
[122:40.38]Don't do that.
[122:44.09]I got one on here.
[122:48.09]Yeah, the spawn right in here is insane.
[122:51.23]They spawn in in this.
[122:52.62]Oh my God, this look at this.
[122:53.76]This is the exact spot I died right here.
[122:56.90]That's right, you did die.
[122:59.80]You guys getting chased right now.
[123:04.17]Oh fuck, I pulled aggro that might be that might be not good.
[123:08.03]Oh my God, it's not funny anymore.
[123:10.31]Oh my God.
[123:13.08]Okay, actually, I'm kind of leaving this area.
[123:25.47]Maybe invite this priest.
[123:29.82]Priest has heals.
[123:30.54]Good.
[123:30.72]That's good, right?
[123:38.24]We just stay right here.
[123:43.87]Look at all these bodies.
[123:51.70]As a kid, I was a dumbass and connected my TV to a clapper and I was a mid boss fight and somebody clapped.
[123:59.51]Why would you make your TV connected to the clapper?
[124:14.45]The only problem with inviting them is the number of bodies we get to loot just got cut in half.
[124:20.06]That's true.
[124:21.88]But it also means we're more likely to stay alive.
[124:25.10]Well, I think what I'm trying to say was I think that they will keep us alive whether they're in our party or not.
[124:32.72]Oh, I see what you're saying.
[124:33.54]So what you're saying is when you want to you want to boot this person is what you're saying.
[124:48.12]Oh no, that's like sad.
[124:51.44]I think they just happy to be here.
[124:55.54]Gaz level 14.
[124:57.18]Yeah, that's kind of scary.
[125:05.83]Get anything in this box.
[125:10.41]I think both of these are part of a quest.
[125:11.79]I just don't know which one.
[125:12.81]Yeah.
[125:22.03]I'm jumping down.
[125:25.37]Oh, people told me that your hardcore character, your Only Fangs character died.
[125:28.81]And I was like, what?
[125:31.63]Technically, the first one did.
[125:33.99]I think they were talking about the second one.
[125:35.85]I think I got baited.
[125:36.59]I think they were lying to me.
[125:39.85]That was wishful thinking.
[125:43.07]I ain't ready to go yet.
[125:49.79]I got to die somewhere more honorable than than here.
[125:55.21]This is a pretty good place to die for your first time, though.
[125:57.36]Are you following the priests instead of me?
[126:00.36]I'm just killing stuff.
[126:02.90]I'm just messing with you.
[126:04.00]I jumped down.
[126:04.46]I'm coming back.
[126:07.42]So are you are you tanking?
[126:08.66]Is it?
[126:08.96]Oh my God, I thought you went all the way down for some reason.
[126:10.98]I thought that was a death.
[126:14.84]It's just foreshadowing.
[126:17.64]Yeah, are you tanking?
[126:24.58]Warrior tank is pretty... Oh, we got the guy.
[126:28.66]Oh, we got the guy?
[126:29.68]We got the guy.
[126:30.52]Okay, that's a run.
[126:32.62]Run?
[126:33.06]No, we're good, we're good.
[126:33.92]We got it, we got it.
[126:36.85]I got the Voidwalker.
[126:37.43]You say that, but I got 380 HP.
[126:38.51]We're good, we're good.
[126:40.69]I got the Voidwalkers here.
[126:55.25]Yeah, Voidwalker is, you know, what they say, goaded.
[127:00.31]Oh, I got it.
[127:00.75]Nice.
[127:00.94]Alright.
[127:01.28]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[127:02.08]Nice.
[127:02.70]Yeah.
[127:03.32]Wait, no.
[127:04.24]This is a new quest.
[127:06.72]What?
[127:08.88]So, yeah, killing him gives us a different quest.
[127:11.72]Oh, shit.
[127:12.26]Okay.
[127:12.72]Well.
[127:14.22]Which is still good because it's auto-completed.
[127:17.78]But yeah, that priest just healed me.
[127:19.66]Thank you, priest.
[127:23.40]He's spawning behind us, too.
[127:33.02]What the hell?
[127:35.16]Do not go over there!
[127:40.50]Which way?
[127:42.72]This guy was just shooting fucking bombs at me.
[127:44.74]I don't even know, how did that guy aggro to me?
[127:48.16]Maybe head back to the entrance?
[128:02.21]I love how, Jerma, you were the secret guest on Etalyx' WoW stream weeks ago, and now Etalyx is the secret guest on your stream.
[128:15.48]Comes around, goes around, I guess.
[128:23.81]There's too many people in here now.
[128:26.11]That's terrifying because that means everything spawns five times faster.
[128:32.72]Any potions or anything to do?
[128:35.04]Speaking of... Hello.
[128:48.97]Voidwalker.
[128:49.67]Voidwalker, best in SWAT.
[129:01.48]we need to make you want to make hot pocket people people do you like are you a hot pocket enjoyer Alex when's the last time you had one last time I had a hot pocket was so far back I can't remember years it's been it's probably been like I don't know seven plus years yeah me too
[129:25.73]I feel like the last Hot Pocket was the pepperoni one.
[129:27.79]The meat with pepperoni pizza one.
[129:31.09]That one's pretty good.
[129:32.93]Hot Pockets are what you eat when you're at someone else's house and they don't have any other food.
[129:39.38]That's true, but it's also not- I wouldn't even complain about that though, even now.
[129:45.03]You know what I mean?
[129:45.55]If you were over at somebody's house right now as a grown man, a fully grown ass man, I really do think I would be like, oh, hey, you want a Hot Pocket?
[129:55.54]Yeah, sure.
[129:57.18]That actually sounds kind of, yeah, I would eat that.
[130:11.53]I remember there was one hot pocket that was so gross, but I would eat it.
[130:21.53]Oh, that's definitely for you.
[130:27.63]Was it 274 armor?
[130:30.37]Oh yeah, huge upgrade.
[130:32.13]Even though it's got int.
[130:36.59]It shouldn't even be able to roll on a shield.
[130:41.55]Although Paladin and Shaman, right?
[130:48.35]The shield looks like the cardboard under a DiGiorno pizza.
[130:55.26]Wait, somebody said they got rid of the sleeve for Hot Pockets.
[130:59.62]How do you make it then?
[131:08.26]You put it in an air fryer now.
[131:15.29]I'm not, you know what?
[131:16.29]I don't know if air frying a hot pocket makes it any better.
[131:21.97]In fact, I would say I would, I would, that's a microwave food to me.
[131:29.31]I've heard they've been doing some extensive testing and changed the formula to make it so that it was easier to yell at.
[131:42.13]I'm scared to go this far in.
[131:44.01]I'm going, let's go back.
[131:47.38]Stuff is spawning so quickly.
[132:00.16]Yeah, I feel like if you put a Hot Pocket in an air fryer, you're changing the chemical composition of what is in there.
[132:07.53]Those things were tested and designed to be cooked for two minutes in the microwave.
[132:13.09]There is not other instructions on a Hot Pocket that say put it in the oven for an hour.
[132:18.69]Because, you know, chicken pot pies, you know, like the Marie calendar chicken pot pie.
[132:23.53]You can do that in the microwave in five minutes or you put it in the oven for 50 minutes.
[132:30.15]And you have to preheat the oven.
[132:31.73]Yeah.
[132:32.57]But I mean, that's different.
[132:33.41]Like there's not, is there second instructions on a hot pocket that says, oh, you can also put this in the oven?
[132:39.55]No.
[132:42.23]If I'm wrong, then holy shit, I'm wrong.
[132:47.74]This is it.
[132:48.43]No, there's not.
[132:51.52]There are other instructions for a hot pocket to put it in the oven?
[133:06.96]Yeah, microwaving pot pies is insane behavior.
[133:11.70]Yeah, I'm talking about hot pockets, not pot pies.
[133:18.91]Although... Etalyx, have you ever microwaved a Marie Callender's pot pie before?
[133:23.47]I have.
[133:27.71]I don't know if I've ever bought a Marie Callender's pot pie.
[133:30.71]What?
[133:30.98]Oh, wow.
[133:32.20]That's... Okay.
[133:33.71]I didn't say they were gross.
[133:34.81]I just don't think I've like... I haven't been down to Marie Callender's catalog, you know?
[133:39.45]It's good.
[133:41.35]That's classic food.
[133:45.59]Banquet pot pies are better?
[133:47.16]Oh, I don't know.
[133:47.92]Marie Callender all the way.
[133:58.14]I do love a good pot pie, though.
[134:01.85]Yeah, they're just so, especially, it's like a do nothing dinner.
[134:06.71]And you put it in the oven, it takes like an hour in the oven.
[134:09.21]It takes like, what, four to 50 minutes or so?
[134:11.77]Did you ever get the Gordon Ramsay frozens?
[134:16.16]Wait, what did you say?
[134:16.92]Gordon Ramsay what?
[134:18.08]Did you ever try like the Gordon Ramsay frozen dinners?
[134:21.92]There are Gordon Ramsay frozens?
[134:24.04]Wait, please tell me there's a picture of him in his chef outfit crossing his arms.
[134:28.68]I think he is on the cover.
[134:30.60]Oh my god.
[134:31.58]No, I haven't, but I kind of want to try it.
[134:36.05]I looked for them like five times at the grocery store and never found them.
[134:40.91]I think they were sold out.
[134:43.57]Wait, wouldn't Gordon Ramsay be the last person to tell you to buy frozen food?
[134:51.76]Oh, what was this?
[134:52.30]Was it frozen?
[134:53.60]Oh, disgusting.
[134:55.38]Oh, wait.
[134:56.24]I'm on the cover?
[134:57.99]Oh, shit.
[135:00.79]And chat, that brings us to our sponsor today, Factor.
[135:05.51]Be sponsored?
[135:09.37]Well, you're not even live.
[135:10.19]I just had like a split second where I thought that was really happening.
[135:17.23]I don't know why.
[135:29.89]It's fucking, you're eating, it's frozen.
[135:32.53]These mozzarella sticks are frozen.
[135:37.49]What kind of food is it?
[135:38.45]Is it like mozzarella sticks and like fish sticks?
[135:40.67]Or is it, is it, it's salmon and... He's got a shepherd's pie and a chicken pot pie.
[135:52.85]Okay.
[135:53.59]The chicken pot pie, I'm going to not, I'm going to keep my mouth shut on that because that actually might be good.
[136:00.83]That was that was gonna kill this thing.
[136:12.33]Has anybody had it?
[136:13.05]Has anybody tried it?
[136:16.86]Vinny reviewed the Gordon Ramsay frozen meals.
[136:18.86]Oh well, what did he say?
[136:23.12]What do you say about the pot pie in particular?
[136:30.32]He hated all of them.
[136:32.41]They were bad.
[136:32.95]He said they were terrible.
[136:38.39]Damn, okay.
[136:39.94]Charlie did a tier list on them and he liked them.
[136:43.74]Seems like we have some conflicting opinions here.
[136:57.33]Charlie likes everything.
[136:58.48]I've seen some of Charlie's food reviews.
[137:01.50]He seems to have some dislikes.
[137:25.19]Etalyx, when are we going to get this stupid item?
[137:33.69]Felweaver SCORN is here.
[137:36.39]Felweaver SCORN?
[137:38.15]Yeah, or somewhere close by.
[137:40.32]Is it an elite?
[137:43.10]Apparently.
[137:44.38]In here?
[137:44.90]I don't know.
[137:46.14]That's kind of terrifying.
[137:46.92]I just got a thing.
[137:47.62]I don't know where they normally are.
[137:56.72]but we'll get it when you stop thinking about it, when you stop looking for it, then it'll appear.
[138:03.60]See, I contemplated getting the, uh, that kind of elite, er, d-d-d-ding thing, but it's terrifying.
[138:09.76]It's more scary than actually just seeing the elite.
[138:13.06]It kind of is, um, because I didn't have it for a while, but I finally gave in because I realized, like, I think once I got over level 20, that if I died because that dude just spawned on top of me, I'd be pissed.
[138:25.89]Yeah.
[138:27.82]Like level 10, level 15, whatever.
[138:30.20]You know, oh, it'd be so funny if an elite just appeared and killed me.
[138:33.28]But once you hit like level 20, 25, 30.
[138:34.64]Yeah, it starts.
[138:39.74]It's like, wow, I kind of wish I knew where that was.
[138:43.05]But yeah, it's like a level 11 elite somewhere.
[138:51.95]We could probably kill it.
[138:52.93]I can click on him.
[138:55.64]I mean, if it's a rare spawn and it's a level 11, we could definitely kill it.
[138:59.46]I think he's fighting somebody.
[139:00.52]You might be able to see it through walls if you mark it.
[139:15.39]Like, yeah, can you mark it?
[139:18.63]Like a skull launder or something?
[139:20.42]Uh, he's not coming up anymore.
[139:21.32]He might be on, like, the north side.
[139:22.46]Hmm.
[139:32.69]Get in there, Voidwalker.
[139:33.63]Come on.
[139:37.57]Okay, would you say you eat frozen dinners, like, semi-regularly?
[139:49.74]Um... No.
[139:51.84]I think... There's always a Marie Callender's in that freezer, though.
[139:57.71]It's kind of, um... It's like a fridge buff.
[140:03.20]If you have that four pack of Marie Callender's pot pies in your freezer, you have like a 10% fridge buff.
[140:12.08]Because they can always be dinner, no matter what.
[140:15.26]It's an always dinner available buff.
[140:21.66]And I'd say anything from all the Trader Joe's frozen dinners too, those are massive fridge buffs.
[140:37.22]I kind of accidentally became like a like an Annie's guy.
[140:43.61]Annie's is great.
[140:48.69]So I've always got like a bunch of the enchiladas.
[140:59.37]The mac and cheese is fantastic.
[141:01.93]Crater Joe's mac and cheese is very good too.
[141:03.95]They do the white cheddar and shells.
[141:05.27]It's amazing.
[141:13.22]Annie's really fucked with the white cheddar mac recipe.
[141:15.24]It sucks now.
[141:16.28]Oh, damn.
[141:16.74]Are you getting... Is that better for you?
[141:18.34]Oh, damn.
[141:18.94]Not... It's not only the green.
[141:20.70]He dropped the quest item.
[141:22.56]Oh, shit.
[141:23.00]This guy was... This guy was buffed up.
[141:29.46]So, I need to get one now.
[141:33.37]We both don't get it.
[141:37.07]That sucks.
[141:41.14]Well, the good news is that the next one that drops... Like, I didn't learn how that worked until recently, where if I found a quest item, it still rolls it for me or something, but it won't drop it for me.
[141:54.62]It'll drop it for you after I've looted the body or something.
[141:58.71]Oh.
[141:58.79]I don't know if that makes sense.
[142:02.49]Technically, it just does a check to see if you've already gotten it, if you, in your game, in your algorithm, rolled it.
[142:09.80]Yeah, so like after I loot everybody, you kind of have to look at it and there might be the quest item for you.
[142:22.10]I like Chef Tony's pizza.
[142:23.48]I haven't really had very many.
[142:26.42]I've had obviously Red Baron and DiGiorno.
[142:32.61]Dr. Oakers was the best, but I can't find Dr. Oakers anymore.
[142:35.61]I don't even know if they make it the way they used to.
[142:49.70]Chef Tony was more like school cafeteria food for me.
[142:54.22]It's crazy how different opinions are just so different, right?
[142:58.25]Somebody just said that Chef Tony pizza was their favorite and they love it and they're always eating it.
[143:02.65]It's so wonderful.
[143:03.99]This guy just said it was worth like as same quality as like school cafeteria food.
[143:12.10]There's a lot there, you know, because everybody's cafeteria was different.
[143:15.44]That's also true.
[143:17.17]Some people had awesome cafeterias and some people had bring peanut butter and jelly to school every day cafeterias.
[143:23.01]Yeah, I've heard plenty of how some schools had like awesome fucking food options at the school.
[143:30.12]And I'm like, what do you mean?
[143:32.16]You didn't just have like a box, a white box with fucking gross pizza in it?
[143:37.03]Like, no, man, we had like a bunch of selection.
[143:38.41]We had like a buffet or whatever.
[143:39.53]It's like, what do you, what?
[143:44.68]I remember getting addicted to Steakums because that's what they were serving at the school.
[143:49.04]I remember it was a huge deal.
[143:53.43]It was like, oh, Thursday is fucking Steakums day.
[143:57.07]And it was just Steakums and a sub roll.
[143:59.93]I got it.
[144:01.91]Nice.
[144:02.39]No wonder I fucking... There were two on these guys.
[144:10.98]Let's carefully get out of here.
[144:19.75]I remember, um, like deli sandwich day was a huge deal.
[144:24.63]Did you ever have like, oh my God, we have like deli day.
[144:28.67]No way.
[144:29.45]Uh, no, my school was like super unhealthy.
[144:33.31]But that, that was rare though.
[144:34.51]That didn't happen all the time.
[144:35.93]We would have like, like chili Fritos, like the chips.
[144:42.77]Chili Fritos day.
[144:48.84]I remember that like French fries were with that.
[144:52.96]That was another thing.
[144:53.64]Did you have French fries at your school lunches too?
[144:56.41]Oh yeah, they they just put French fries like every day.
[144:59.15]Because they're like if everybody hates all the rest of this ship, delete the French fries.
[145:02.65]Yeah, and some people would just get fries.
[145:04.71]That's the only thing they ate.
[145:12.32]And I think I did that quite a few times as well.
[145:19.63]Orange chicken went crazy at school.
[145:21.21]I don't think I ever had orange chicken in middle school or high school or anything like that.
[145:28.10]Yeah, we had we had pizza day like every Thursday.
[145:33.54]We just ate pizza for lunch every Thursday.
[145:38.64]Yeah, that's kind of funny that pizza.
[145:42.90]Was it did it come in a white box?
[145:44.51]Was it like a white box that was a filled up the whole thing with a big square pizza?
[145:48.92]I don't know if they got it from somewhere, if they made it themselves, but it was just, like, white paper plates with two slices.
[145:57.85]And then the kids would... everyone would go dunk it in ranch.
[146:01.65]Like, everyone would just go to, like, the little ranch pump and get, like, multiple cups of ranch and just slather it over the pizza.
[146:13.60]Yeah, we need to get those kids that brain food.
[146:17.71]Like fucking boxed pizza and ranch dressing.
[146:28.28]Where's the turn in for the thing we picked up off that dude?
[146:32.60]I think it's in the where the instance is.
[146:47.71]People are apparently surprised that you had condiments.
[146:49.51]They said my school had none of that.
[146:51.85]We had ketchup, ranch.
[146:55.79]Other salad seasoning.
[146:58.83]Yeah, I think we had.
[146:59.87]At least I think at least we had ketchup.
[147:03.77]Maybe ketchup and mustard.
[147:04.70]That was it though.
[147:06.26]Yeah, we had mustard.
[147:13.38]Those kids just have to eat like plain hot dogs, I guess.
[147:18.53]Or plain fries.
[147:23.25]Yeah, the fries always were... And I don't know what they did to them.
[147:26.91]I don't know why they were so good.
[147:29.17]But I would put... They were pretty good.
[147:30.95]Yeah, I would put the middle school and high school french fries.
[147:33.77]School lunch french fries.
[147:35.61]Those were up against McDonald's.
[147:36.89]I think they might have been... It may have been better.
[147:39.38]That might be the best french fry I've ever had.
[147:42.58]Was high school french fries.
[147:50.00]Do you think any of that is because it was just like better than any of the alternatives?
[147:54.91]Like was it the best by exclusion of everything else?
[148:01.10]I would imagine it's probably a lot to do with it.
[148:10.56]because like my other option was bring your lunch to school and it was like one bag of chips like a turkey sandwich with cheese because of course I didn't like lettuce and tomato so it's just like a regular deli sandwich which my mother lovingly made dude I would I used to love it when you'd open that bag you open that bag and there's a tuna sandwich tuna melt there was like a tuna with cheese he's like yes
[148:47.21]I love tuna fish, though.
[148:48.03]Tuna fish is probably one of my favorite sandwiches.
[148:50.29]It's up there.
[148:52.75]That's another thing that's so easy.
[148:54.25]That is a pantry buff.
[149:01.24]I was the guy at the lunch table that was like, hey, don't throw that away.
[149:06.18]Like, I'll finish it.
[149:07.91]Hey, that's good.
[149:11.39]Someone's going to eat it.
[149:18.42]Tuna, you have such a weird taste.
[149:20.24]What's wrong with tuna fish?
[149:21.52]Etalyx, you like tuna fish, right?
[149:23.56]Yeah, tuna's good.
[149:24.64]It's good.
[149:25.52]What's wrong with it?
[149:27.21]I didn't start to appreciate like tuna melts until the last few years, though.
[149:31.93]Yeah, they're awesome.
[149:45.60]Look, the number of people that just said disgusting or gross, okay?
[149:50.16]You're privileged, alright?
[149:54.33]I just think that people, and I get it, people just get really put off by a bunch of slop.
[150:02.09]And it's, I get it.
[150:04.05]Food, half of food is the visual presentation, and tuna fish is just, it's just mushy, lumpy slop.
[150:11.02]I'm just kidding anyway, I was spoiled as shit.
[150:12.74]What in thunder are the hordes?
[150:16.43]Oh, here it is, OK.
[150:21.07]Alright, so now we go to Thrall.
[150:27.96]After we turn this on, I'm going to take a quick break.
[150:30.58]I want to get up and stretch in.
[150:31.78]I think Otto wants to go out.
[150:36.16]Go to Thrall.
[150:37.00]Where is he up there?
[150:38.36]I think there's a large portion of people in chat who will not eat leftovers.
[150:44.78]They go in the fridge, they sit in the fridge, and then they get thrown away.
[150:50.82]Yeah, it's... The thing about leftovers, though, is that leftovers have this weird... Leftovers are a fridge debuff to me.
[150:59.85]Because I will make something.
[151:02.93]Let's say I have make like a chicken parm or something.
[151:04.79]Okay, I'm going to make the spaghetti and make the pasta and have the pasta sauce.
[151:07.93]Okay, I'm going to put a chicken cutlet on it or whatever.
[151:11.89]After a day or two...
[151:14.29]It's you, you eat it for a day or two in a row and then you, it's still good and it's still fine, but you know, it's in there, but it's like, I don't, I don't do, I really want, I've had this like three, four days in a row.
[151:25.63]And it's like, fuck, do I, and it's like three, it's been three days.
[151:28.62]What's, what's the, uh, what's, what's the CDC say about this?
[151:37.54]That hits extra hard if you're eating just for you.
[151:40.70]Like if you're cooking for you and eating for you, then you have like two to three times as many portions.
[151:46.12]Yeah.
[151:47.00]And you end up eating the same thing like five days in a row for every meal.
[151:51.00]That's why I've been trying just to make or make the stuff that I know I'm going to eat just for that day or two days.
[152:00.06]Because if you can make a lot of food to make sure you have leftovers,
[152:06.60]After like that third or fourth day, I kind of just... I've tried it before.
[152:12.40]Now I just try to make the stuff I'm going to eat in one day.
[152:15.12]Or over the course of like a 3-3 day period.
[152:18.08]Not like 3-5.
[152:18.46]Leftovers suck if you use the microwave.
[152:30.19]That's why if you're going to do leftovers and you want it to be fast, you need to have something that's capable of being brought back to life in the microwave.
[152:37.48]And not everything can do that, which is why it makes you even more like, eh, do I really want that tonight?
[152:42.52]It kind of tastes like shit in the microwave.
[152:44.14]Okay, I think we're got one more thing to do with this guy, right?
[153:05.37]You missed the RP.
[153:08.45]Not looking at the chat that much.
[153:10.71]Well, the in-game chat.
[153:11.53]I'm looking at the stream chat.
[153:16.68]Slow cooker stuff reheats well.
[153:19.12]That's true.
[153:20.32]You used to do slow cooker stuff.
[153:21.76]I remember you'd make like pulled pork and it was good.
[153:28.20]Slow cooker pulled pork.
[153:29.66]That's my favorite one.
[153:30.99]That's a specialty.
[153:34.13]Yeah, Etalyx used to make a pretty mean pulled pork.
[153:46.18]Some slow cooker chili.
[153:52.93]Good stuff.
[154:06.83]Slow cooker stew.
[154:07.55]Yeah, it's so good.
[154:10.93]My mother makes corned beef and cabbage in a slow cooker.
[154:16.95]It's so, so good.
[154:21.35]I think we have to expose him, right?
[154:25.94]Yeah, just do like the dialog options.
[154:29.86]And then we got to go back to Thrall.
[154:36.71]Yeah.
[154:37.19]Can't we just text him?
[154:41.40]If he can slash yell with his heralds, then we should be able to slash yell back to him.
[154:45.92]That's true.
[154:57.15]Yeah, my quest tracker was just huge for no reason.
[155:09.92]Oh, he's in here.
[155:20.71]Yeah, a good slab of corned beef in a slow cooker.
[155:23.51]Sitting there all day.
[155:24.95]A little cabbage in there.
[155:27.71]I like the broth.
[155:30.69]A nice yellow mustard.
[155:33.59]The problem with slow cookers...
[155:36.43]is I never wake up early enough to do like the nice eight hours on low and it's always like the five hours on high and people say they can't tell the difference but it's worse really yeah I I always I always thought that the lower and slower you did it the better right
[156:02.39]Yeah, just like low and slow, low and slow.
[156:07.33]I've always wanted to get a smoker or something, but I always am terrified I'm going to like burn my fucking like I'm going to like burn it down or something.
[156:15.68]Those things kind of scare me.
[156:20.10]OK, so now we get that.
[156:24.52]Are you guys food network hosts?
[156:27.16]No, we're just we're just talking about food.
[156:29.38]Oh, we're just humans.
[156:33.02]I mean, yeah, it does end up that way, though.
[156:35.86]It's it does end up this way all the time.
[156:39.88]I'm going to take a quick break.
[156:40.96]I'll be back in like I'll be back in like five minutes.
[156:44.02]I'm going to take kind of a longer one.
[156:45.10]I want to get some water.
[156:48.56]But I'm afraid to do this.
[156:52.34]You're we're both 12.
[156:53.46]Oh, yeah, I was just kind of getting it ready.
[156:56.34]We don't have to do rage fire right now.
[156:58.28]Okay, cool.
[156:59.76]I would say I'd be comfortable doing this at like 14, 14 or 15.
[157:02.13]I mean, if I'm going to tank, I don't want to take it level 13.
[157:06.99]Right?
[157:08.15]No, that'd be bad.
[157:09.89]That is the quickest way for us to lose both these characters.
[157:16.70]I'll be back in like five minutes.
[157:26.27]Alright, I'll be back.
[157:27.27]Ads are going to play.
[157:28.69]I'll see you guys soon.
[157:30.69]See you in five minutes.
[158:40.84]Thank you.
[160:10.01]So,
[161:08.43]Thank you.
[162:46.94]I'm just making another tea in another two minutes.
[163:36.40]so so
[165:06.83]Okay, I am back.
[165:25.80]Turn the music off.
[165:29.60]Let's see, hello.
[165:30.94]Alright, I'm back.
[165:35.00]Uh, what's up?
[165:43.18]So... We're... We could just... We could probably go down to... Um, what's it there?
[165:51.21]Some of these Razor Hail quests?
[165:55.03]We could probably just... If you wanted to stay partied, we could just go straight to Barrens.
[166:01.01]That would be a lot safer, wouldn't it?
[166:05.13]Yeah, let's go to the Barrens.
[166:06.45]Let's make it interesting.
[166:07.83]They're like level 12, level 13, kind of a lot of kill quests.
[166:13.10]Yeah, we'll probably level up pretty quickly.
[166:14.86]We'll just do a big turn and get to like 13, 14.
[166:17.02]Oh, get the kiss.
[166:24.43]Oh, right.
[166:25.81]Since you're standing right there.
[166:27.55]That really took us an hour to do that?
[166:31.98]this game just burns time it does we had it really easy in there because we had a 300 HP from rind and then we had 200 HP from smitten yeah we had a double HP that would have been way scarier that named dude talk to me and I was like let's run I would I would have been dead without those buffs
[167:02.26]That's actually terrifying.
[167:03.44]Yeah, you would have died if it weren't for the buffs.
[167:08.04]That's very scary.
[167:09.42]200 health is a lot at level 10.
[167:21.39]Go like this.
[167:32.03]OK.
[167:43.05]When do I get?
[167:43.73]I think it's like 20.
[167:48.93]Shadowburn is great.
[167:51.87]Shadowburn is just an instant 100 damage.
[167:57.99]At rank one, it's amazing.
[168:02.00]When does warrior get taunt?
[168:06.80]I think it doesn't come with defensive stance.
[168:09.74]I don't even have defensive stance yet.
[168:11.80]Oh, so you got to get defensive stance.
[168:13.30]I think that's like a warrior quest you're going to have to do eventually.
[168:15.58]I think I have one for the barons right now, actually.
[168:23.60]We could go do it if you want.
[168:24.86]Just experience and you get your because you're going to need it.
[168:32.72]Apparently it's a level 10 quest.
[168:34.66]I can probably try and do it because I already have the flight path to Crossroads.
[168:39.81]Oh yeah, I'm going to have to run there, so.
[168:41.71]Yeah.
[168:44.03]You might be able to get it done before I get there.
[168:45.96]I think my warrior thing's in Durotar.
[168:52.90]Yeah, and also too, guys, if we do any dungeons, anytime I do a dungeon, I'm locking in.
[168:59.19]I'm not even going to be looking over a chat.
[169:01.59]It's going to be total lock in, comms open, gaming hard.
[169:15.08]Is there no fast travel?
[169:16.56]Welcome to 2004.
[169:17.04]The answer is no.
[169:22.67]I gotta run from here to here to here to here.
[169:28.92]So strap in.
[169:40.73]Some classes get fast movement.
[169:44.08]But until you unlock flight paths, no.
[169:47.76]But to answer the question more meaningfully, you do get fast travel.
[169:51.95]It's like faster travel.
[169:53.45]It's not quite instant.
[169:57.37]Each zone has one or two flight paths and you can get on a... I almost said griffin because alliance is way better.
[170:04.22]I don't even know... A wyvern.
[170:07.36]Sorry.
[170:07.58]There you go.
[170:07.96]Wyvern.
[170:09.98]You fly on a wyvern and it takes...
[170:12.88]Took a few minutes to go from each place to place.
[170:17.49]And here's a hot take for you.
[170:19.83]I wish they would bring this kind of stuff back.
[170:23.25]Because I think when games... Yeah, when games started having UB... Oh, uh... I'm there.
[170:33.19]I don't know.
[170:34.41]I think kind of it takes away the journey.
[170:36.26]It takes away the adventure.
[170:41.56]You get to see the stuff.
[170:42.96]You get to look at everything.
[170:43.84]You get to... It's much better.
[170:50.76]Basically, there's no reason to have an interconnected continental map if you can fast travel everywhere.
[170:57.59]It may as well just be like a bunch of instances.
[171:01.78]Yeah.
[171:02.86]I know when flying mounts became a thing and became the way to travel, a lot of people were against it because it let you just kind of coast over and skip over all the content.
[171:14.06]You kind of just fly over everything.
[171:18.69]I was always a proponent.
[171:19.47]I liked the... You get to max level, then you get flying.
[171:24.28]Because then you're forced to see everything.
[171:26.32]You can't just fly through everything.
[171:27.78]You can use your regular mounts.
[171:28.78]I like the get to the level cap.
[171:31.04]Then you can fly.
[171:36.15]As long as level cap isn't... Log back in and we will give you a free level 60.
[171:41.81]Just come to the capital.
[171:44.79]yeah the retail kind of got a little out of control with oh just just buy a level 80 whatever say oh okay the reaction to ashes of alar was nuts
[172:10.93]You get mounts at 40, I think.
[172:12.33]Some people get free mounts.
[172:14.39]Which, thankfully, my class is one of them.
[172:17.05]Because they're expensive.
[172:17.87]What are they, like 100 gold?
[172:19.79]As you can see, it is so hard to keep and hold money in Classic.
[172:24.48]Because everything is expensive.
[172:26.86]Buying your spells, eventually in the next 5 to 10 levels, it's like a gold.
[172:31.74]It's one gold to get a new rank.
[172:33.20]There's so much money sink in Classic that having 100 gold...
[172:39.13]is actually kind of hard to do.
[172:42.99]It's just like a, it's like a grind mentality.
[172:45.01]You're either like a World of Warcraft and RuneScape type of person or you're not.
[172:52.08]Like you either like the grind or you don't.
[172:57.36]I think Classic does a pretty good job of it though.
[172:59.36]Yeah, like the travel is kind of reflected in that.
[173:04.82]There's no flight path in Razor Hill, right?
[173:06.80]I don't think so.
[173:08.30]No.
[173:17.67]You still have to do the training for it.
[173:19.35]Oh, you do still have to do... So what is it?
[173:20.97]50 gold?
[173:21.90]30 gold?
[173:23.86]So instead of 100 gold, it's 40 gold or 30 gold.
[173:28.66]Which is still way better.
[173:29.62]That's a 70% discount.
[173:30.14]Sounds great.
[173:30.50]Training is like 10 gold.
[173:46.48]Better than almost a hundred.
[173:55.22]You haven't clicked a spell the whole stream.
[173:58.62]Uh, yeah.
[173:59.26]Yes, I have.
[174:02.02]I've been clicking all kinds of shit.
[174:03.62]I click this.
[174:04.28]I click that.
[174:05.08]I've clicked this.
[174:06.88]Hey, it's spell click Sunday.
[174:08.17]Okay.
[174:18.86]What would you rate this out of 10?
[174:20.28]10.
[174:22.08]Sorry, it's just true.
[174:23.22]10.
[174:26.24]World of Warcraft up until Wrath of the Lich King is a 10.
[174:29.88]It's a 10 out of 10.
[174:34.50]By until you mean through, right?
[174:37.36]Yeah, like the journey from classic to the end of the Lich King arc is a 10 out of 10.
[174:46.52]Cataclysm was like a 8.5.
[174:48.42]Mists of Pandaria is like a 6.
[174:53.22]And then everything else until Legion is a 0.
[174:56.29]Then everything after Legion, I kind of don't really have that much of an opinion or experience with it.
[175:13.72]Dude, you know what's crazy?
[175:14.66]Eventually they're going to get to Legion Classic.
[175:17.18]And we're going to get to play Legion again.
[175:18.78]Isn't that awesome?
[175:25.17]Metallix was a Legion Andy.
[175:26.39]This dude is here and wanted to help.
[175:43.61]Yeah, I can drop group too if it's easier for you.
[175:46.09]Nah, it's okay.
[175:50.87]Didn't you stream Legion?
[175:52.23]Yeah.
[175:53.35]And like... Okay, but that's back when... Yeah, that was the worst stream ever, I think.
[176:01.90]No, no, no.
[176:02.90]It really wasn't though.
[176:08.20]I was there.
[176:11.85]To the Barrens.
[176:13.81]I made it to the Barrens.
[176:14.69]I did it.
[176:16.91]I did it.
[176:24.22]Honestly, that stream is a fever dream for me.
[176:27.76]I've sort of like overwritten most of it.
[176:39.57]Got to get to the crossroads and then... See, the Barrens has two flight paths, which is very helpful.
[176:44.93]You can travel from here to here very quickly.
[176:53.16]I don't mind walking, though, because I got this big, burly... I got this big, burly man with me, so he can protect me if anything goes wrong.
[177:06.82]Wait, what'd you just say?
[177:08.91]My Voidwalker.
[177:14.29]Not talking about you.
[177:15.79]I'm talking about the Voidwalker.
[177:17.21]I mean, my Tauren is pretty burly.
[177:26.36]You do have a big burly man.
[177:28.24]That's true.
[177:34.29]Yeah, I get to sit back and just like throw the disease at people and throw the fucking toxins at people.
[177:40.07]And then the- he can go up there and actually fight.
[177:59.49]I still don't have a profession.
[178:02.66]Yeah, but I told you guys my profession theory.
[178:06.68]Professions are so expensive and it's such a time sink and it takes so much to do it.
[178:12.62]At level 12, if I just get hit by a stray fucking shadow bolt and die, there goes all the profession, all the money I spent on it.
[178:23.90]If I just aggro the elites on this road randomly and die, well, there goes the three gold I had to spend to get my professions up.
[178:35.03]What would you want to do on a warlock?
[178:41.87]I would say enchanting, but then everybody wants to talk to you.
[178:48.57]Engineering is the survive one.
[178:51.17]Maybe just tailoring.
[178:52.08]Tailoring seems just fun and easy.
[178:54.80]I picked engineering on this dude.
[178:57.78]And I got alchemy on my shaman.
[179:02.12]Alchemy Herbalism seems good too.
[179:03.28]Just give yourself the buffs.
[179:04.82]The buffs are really good.
[179:05.70]The potions are great.
[179:06.66]Oh yeah.
[179:07.54]The early ones are amazing.
[179:10.00]Just making sure that you like always have the most current potion is good too.
[179:13.40]Because like right now, the potion I've got, the like oh shit button, will heal me 70 to 90 out of 900 health.
[179:27.19]But that's not even 10%.
[179:27.91]Yeah, that's not going to help you.
[179:33.48]Eventually you can get the lesser ones though.
[179:35.40]The lesser is what?
[179:36.34]Something 180?
[179:43.54]Hey, that could save your life though.
[179:44.70]70 to 90 damage.
[179:45.90]That is one crit from an enemy.
[179:50.93]That's like a big hit from a mob.
[179:53.89]Alright, I've made it.
[179:58.69]I'm in the crossroads.
[180:00.51]Okay.
[180:02.02]I need to fly over.
[180:09.39]I got some stuff I gotta sell and I gotta contemplate if I want to grab like herbalism or something special.
[180:15.83]There's no herbs in the barrens that are level one though, are there?
[180:18.53]Maybe peace bloom every so often.
[180:25.27]This gray cloak is better than what I have on.
[180:28.79]What do I have on for cloak?
[180:30.13]Oh, OK.
[180:41.38]I look awful.
[180:42.64]Is it better to?
[180:50.75]OK, I think that's good.
[181:08.64]I'll make some advantages.
[181:17.12]Oh no, the dude I have to turn into is at Far Watch Post.
[181:22.78]Oh, the thing all the way up the north?
[181:24.89]I think it's the one on the border between Durotar and Barrens.
[181:29.25]Like where you... I should have just like walked with you.
[181:36.28]Hey, I'm doing some... I'm doing some stuff.
[181:37.98]I got some time.
[181:40.78]I'm in no rush.
[181:44.10]Look at all these quests.
[181:44.94]These are going to be so, so awesome.
[181:48.74]I love doing a dungeon for the first time because you just have, you get like 10,000 experience.
[181:54.74]You get like two, three quarters of a bar doing a dungeon for the first time.
[181:58.37]It's great.
[181:59.25]There's also a fifth one inside.
[182:04.73]So like RFC in particular will be like over a whole, a full level.
[182:12.69]gonna get rid of the terrorist ball quests except for this one because I might go to silver pine eventually alright let's load up the thing about the best part about the barons is there's you get this amazing 10 quest in one spot and then you end up coming back here with like 10 quests you also just randomly get rend every so often that's true too
[182:39.45]Yeah, this one is killing the plane striders.
[182:41.89]These ones, at least the initial ones, are very easy.
[182:59.07]How do I know?
[182:59.47]What do you mean I don't have?
[183:00.13]What are you talking about?
[183:01.09]I don't know any flights connected to this one.
[183:04.05]Uh-oh.
[183:04.31]Did you not talk to the dude in Oregon?
[183:07.07]I thought all the major cities, you already knew them.
[183:10.05]Your race capital is.
[183:12.27]Oh, what the fuck?
[183:15.36]You mean to tell me I got to run all the way back there?
[183:17.66]You hearthed.
[183:19.06]You bound, right?
[183:23.30]Oh, I just made it the crossroads.
[183:24.88]Oh, be good.
[183:29.12]I just, I thought that it was, it's only the major city that you come from that you own that flight path.
[183:35.24]Not, oh man.
[183:40.16]Hey, well, you know what?
[183:40.92]It's alright.
[183:41.64]I'll go do that eventually.
[183:42.62]I'm going to have to do it eventually.
[183:45.34]Or, hey, we could just say I'll never go back to Orgrimmar ever again.
[183:49.00]And I'm just going to... This is... I like Thunder Bluff the best anyways.
[183:57.51]So eventually when I get there, it'll be fine.
[184:04.44]And the monkey's paw of I love everything being so hard to get to curls.
[184:14.23]How do you get to... Is Mulgore... It's kind of dangerous for me to run to Mulgore right now, isn't it?
[184:19.43]There's a lot of like level 20s in that area.
[184:24.77]Oh shit, the dungeon is inside of Orgrimmar.
[184:26.64]That's right.
[184:29.26]Okay, well, before we get a group, let's make sure I get there first because otherwise I'm going to have to be, hey guys, I have to walk from the barons.
[184:36.97]I'm going to give, you guys will vote kick me out of that group.
[184:43.47]Make sure I get over there first.
[184:47.38]Alright, I picked up all this stuff.
[184:52.26]I got these two up here.
[185:01.80]It is a lot of kill quests.
[185:04.04]There's a lot of... You just have to run around and kill stuff.
[185:17.71]Level 15.
[185:18.69]Oh, the harpies?
[185:19.37]Yeah.
[185:20.55]That's up here.
[185:22.05]Those things are terrifying.
[185:23.07]People die up there all the time.
[185:31.59]Alright.
[185:32.01]Oh, I already have it.
[185:32.59]He's right here.
[185:38.07]What professions are even in the crossroads?
[185:39.75]Because I'm just going to I'll just take one to take one.
[185:48.64]Looks like there is.
[185:53.78]Hey, I'll go.
[185:54.34]It's a bad map.
[185:56.12]The right.
[185:59.12]Oh, there's a tailor right here.
[185:59.94]Okay.
[186:00.64]I'll do tailoring.
[186:01.42]Tailoring seems like you don't have to do a gathering profession, so that's good.
[186:07.44]Make bags for myself and whoever.
[186:14.05]Yeah, tailoring is a solid choice because if you end up joining a guild anyway, I can just trade you potions from my main.
[186:22.03]Alright, tailoring.
[186:24.40]Tailoring.
[186:29.40]I can make a shirt.
[186:37.97]I can make pants.
[186:41.47]Here's the cloth sink.
[186:42.67]It's no longer just bandages, but.
[186:51.99]I'm gonna make a cool outfit.
[187:00.95]Alright, I am ready.
[187:04.69]Me too.
[187:06.07]I think, what do you want?
[187:06.71]Just go up to the... You want to kill the Razormane stuff up here in the... Yeah, yeah.
[187:12.95]How can you even see where they are on that map?
[187:17.08]True.
[187:17.66]There's so much shit.
[187:19.74]I just kind of guessed.
[187:21.00]I just guessed they were up there.
[187:22.60]You can kill the Planestriders too.
[187:31.73]Where did my Voidwalker just go?
[187:47.64]So how do you like Warrior so far?
[187:50.44]Uh, he's so much better with all the health buffs.
[187:55.11]I was doing it I didn't have rind until like today so like all day yesterday I was just struggling every single mob stop to eat or heal fight one plane strider stop to eat yeah warrior scares the hell out of me I'm getting through the first 20 to 30 levels as warrior feels very daunting without the health buffs um
[188:22.16]A single same level mob gets me down to about a third of my health.
[188:25.43]I have to have like finger on the potion hotkey at all times.
[188:31.07]That's so scary.
[188:31.89]Alright, we need to go after.
[188:35.91]It's fun when you get it going though.
[188:41.36]Yeah, level 30 plus warrior is some of the most fun in World of Warcraft.
[188:48.72]Somebody murdered all these.
[188:51.77]You're just so deadly.
[188:52.63]It's so gear dependent, but when you get a good weapon and some good plate, you can kind of just destroy everything.
[189:10.38]The reason that I want to be warlock the most or like have a warlock is the fact that your pets get a random name.
[189:20.22]Yeah, it's cool.
[189:20.88]It's like pulling a... It's like getting a toy out of a toy box or something.
[189:26.25]Like, what am I going to get?
[189:26.91]What is it?
[189:31.75]You can name your hunter pets, but yeah, I kind of do prefer to give them to you.
[189:43.66]I think free-for-all loot might be on.
[189:45.90]Yeah, it's turned off.
[189:46.50]You care about me stealing every item.
[189:54.88]I gotta kill a bunch of these things.
[189:55.66]I think you're the only one that needs the quest item, though.
[189:58.12]I did this one quest.
[190:00.16]Oh, okay.
[190:00.52]So you should get all of them.
[190:01.80]Do you still have a Hellstone?
[190:04.40]Yes.
[190:04.98]Okay.
[190:09.20]And you can only have, like, one at a time, right?
[190:12.18]Yeah, you can only have one.
[190:15.32]Yeah, Warlock is good.
[190:16.58]Warlock is fun because there's a lot of different play styles with Warlock.
[190:21.16]I like the dot.
[190:22.54]You can do dot focused, you can do pet focused, or you can just do destruction, bomb, crits.
[190:27.74]That's what I want to do.
[190:28.50]I want to just do, and I'm going to do Conflag.
[190:30.76]I know Conflagrate is, hey, you only use that move once in PvP, but whatever.
[190:36.51]I don't care.
[190:36.93]I want to be the fire guy.
[190:45.85]Yeah, just wait till I get a 4000 damage conflagrate crit and end up killing one of the bosses and that's the only reason why we did it.
[190:53.93]Just wait until you accidentally use it when the boss is reflecting magic.
[191:02.51]My life just flashed before my eyes and nothing even happened.
[191:05.36]You just scared me.
[191:17.17]Oh sick, hold on.
[191:30.86]There's a whole dungeon party here.
[191:32.78]I didn't buy any thread.
[191:37.68]No, that's alright.
[191:54.29]This is pretty chill.
[191:56.23]Yeah.
[192:12.62]I thought that was you.
[192:16.52]Oh this guy.
[192:22.87]Yeah, kill quests just go so much faster with more people.
[192:24.77]I'm not going to pull a thousand things if I... I don't think so.
[192:37.94]What are your thoughts on spray cheese?
[192:46.92]Um...
[192:49.48]I... Easy cheese is good.
[192:51.62]Very, very randomly.
[192:52.84]And I'm talking about you're in the grocery store and you're in the aisle.
[192:56.04]And that's a once every two to three year purchase.
[192:59.26]Damn.
[193:00.73]You're getting some good shit.
[193:03.19]Um, I don't actually know how to use swords.
[193:05.59]Oh.
[193:07.53]Well, I... Do you want it?
[193:08.43]Because I want it.
[193:12.09]Um...
[193:12.96]maybe you yeah if you want to give it to me I'll hold on to it yeah you're the warrior right you're the one that can use it is it like tin silver probably sell it or something too I mean like uh how much is it to like train a weapon skill oh uh it was 10 silver yeah at least for stay that was uh staves
[193:54.93]Two strength, two agility.
[193:56.09]That is like this.
[193:57.17]Oh my god.
[193:58.69]What is going on here?
[193:59.65]Damn.
[194:01.41]Well, you're gonna have quite the selection.
[194:07.51]The World of Warcraft gods heard you yesterday when you said that all you were getting was cloth and intellect gear.
[194:17.20]I was slower than the other warrior.
[194:18.74]I'm sorry.
[194:22.04]Does that do more damage than the other one?
[194:24.93]4 stamina too.
[194:25.49]That's pretty good.
[194:27.67]The one that I got is 8.3.
[194:28.55]This place is always a shitshow.
[194:31.93]There's always 10 people here.
[194:33.79]And people just get spawned on and die here.
[194:47.88]Mine.
[194:48.70]Mine.
[194:52.30]I've never seen this many greens drop in a row.
[194:55.04]This low.
[195:00.65]Here?
[195:00.91]Did we just get delivery?
[195:04.95]Did we get mob delivery?
[195:24.28]Get this guy here.
[195:27.26]Hold on, Voidwalker.
[195:28.30]Do not go running up there.
[195:30.36]Okay.
[195:30.98]Alright.
[195:31.74]We got cut.
[195:32.62]There are a lot of people now.
[195:34.56]Be careful.
[195:38.24]I don't think we're in any real danger, considering this lair has this many people right here.
[195:42.17]So I think we're alright.
[195:43.21]The danger is you think you're not in danger, and then suddenly you turn around and everybody's gone.
[195:48.55]That's true.
[195:54.77]And the only thing that's there are five enemies that have just spawned behind you.
[196:04.18]I should be using my imp since we got a warrior.
[196:08.28]I actually like the extra tank in terrifying situations.
[196:12.29]I feel like it helped a lot in that cave.
[196:15.79]It's not like, oh my god, we need to do more damage.
[196:17.77]I think we're fine.
[196:18.47]I'd rather have the safety.
[196:22.56]He doesn't trust me as a tank.
[196:26.07]I trust you as a tank.
[196:27.69]It's just good to have another one that's right next to you.
[196:31.41]I don't trust me.
[196:35.18]I don't even have defensive stance.
[196:36.62]That's also true too.
[196:38.24]Oh my God.
[196:43.34]What is going on?
[196:44.06]You've won the greed roll for like all three of the weapons.
[196:51.62]So like it looks like it's for me, but really it's for you.
[196:55.54]Okay, well, take your pick out of all these because which one do you want?
[197:01.29]The axe I got here.
[197:03.95]Let's get out of the way because we'll get spawned on.
[197:17.09]I love the dots.
[197:18.93]Maybe I should go affliction.
[197:23.55]I'm gonna change my mind ten times, I know it.
[197:25.63]I'll end up as Demonology.
[197:27.43]I feel like Warrior only has like one route.
[197:32.23]You put five points in Cruelty and then the rest of your points in Arms.
[197:42.75]Arms is fun.
[197:44.65]TBC and Wrath Arms is some of the most fun I think Warrior ever was.
[198:07.07]Actually, I want another shard if I can get it.
[198:09.03]Look at these spawns.
[198:21.10]How come your character's not named?
[198:23.16]Lots of dots.
[198:28.10]Let's go find the plane striders.
[198:32.03]I think we got everything we need, right?
[198:35.93]okay here you want to take a look they take a look at the uh the selection that I got this I got I think that's it this is the first one you gave me and it just seems better unless I'm missing something three so the axes are slower yeah I think that sword is somebody saying that sword might be like best in slot for a while
[199:07.66]So you can just keep the other ones and sell them.
[199:10.24]20 to 30 chance or whatever.
[199:11.94]That actually is pretty good for right now.
[199:18.00]Alright, so that's that we need to go.
[199:19.48]We need Raptor heads.
[199:21.96]Yeah, you still need plane striders, yeah?
[199:30.26]Almost 13.
[199:38.08]That could sell for a few gold, easy.
[199:40.79]Really, damn.
[199:43.83]You can equip it at level 7, so I guess that's true.
[199:45.94]You can really power through the first 15 levels.
[199:57.94]Do enchanting with tailoring.
[200:00.04]Yeah, but enchanting means that people like, everyone wants to talk to you.
[200:03.08]Everyone wants, hey, you got the, you're enchanting?
[200:05.65]Oh, nice.
[200:06.09]Okay, I'll take plus three to stand to bracers.
[200:09.01]I'll take the 10 damage to that.
[200:10.17]I'll take the 10 health to chest.
[200:14.97]Somebody's got to enchant my gear.
[200:16.39]It's true.
[200:22.56]Think of the tips though.
[200:32.39]You do make a lot.
[200:34.47]If you do, if you just shout out in Orgrimmar or in Thunder Bluff or something like that.
[200:39.17]Giving away free +2 stamina, two bracers.
[200:44.07]Tips appreciated.
[200:45.47]With a wink face.
[200:47.95]You'll get five to ten silver.
[200:49.47]You'll get at least one to five silver for most people.
[200:52.77]If you sit there for an hour.
[200:53.71]You can make a gold probably in an hour or two.
[200:57.47]Probably even less than that.
[201:03.87]Probably like two gold in an hour.
[201:26.12]How many hours from now is the meteor going to hit?
[201:31.26]10 years or something?
[201:33.42]A lot of hours.
[201:37.06]We got 10?
[201:37.72]10 years?
[201:41.66]Before the meteor is supposed to hit somewhere?
[201:55.12]Get naked and go to Goldshire.
[202:02.85]You want to just go get killed by the guards and... It's okay, you can bring your big burly men with you.
[202:19.69]Hey, there's something that's actually great about knowing that you're in trouble and you just send in the Voidwalker and just turn and run the other direction.
[202:39.64]It would be kind of funny to just roll up naked to Goldshire with, uh, like, four level 60s.
[202:46.05]What do you got?
[202:46.45]What do you- Wait, wait.
[202:47.13]Otto the dog has something for me.
[202:48.33]Hold on.
[202:48.63]What do you got?
[202:55.07]I mean, it's- Did you- Where'd you find this?
[203:00.28]Did you find that in the trash?
[203:01.88]Did you get that out of the trash?
[203:08.70]It's one strike.
[203:09.94]I don't use daggers.
[203:11.02]And remember, I'm not taking anything.
[203:13.39]I'm not taking anything.
[203:14.03]Oh my god.
[203:29.12]I can't write.
[203:29.68]There we go.
[203:47.96]Somebody said, oh God, he's addicted to WoW, and they did a crying emoji face.
[203:56.09]Many people have lost loved ones to WoW.
[203:58.89]Well, time.
[204:00.91]It was the right time, okay?
[204:02.74]I need three more beaks.
[204:14.18]Yeah, they should be all dropping for you, because I don't need any.
[204:29.99]Two more.
[204:31.71]Beaks.
[204:36.63]I will say the one thing I do like about the horde is the... Whenever you're walking around, the barons are in Ogremora.
[204:43.75]Usually in the crossroads, right?
[204:44.69]You get that... Just orcs making grunting noises?
[204:54.24]Yeah, the orcs just kind of grunt.
[204:55.62]You just hear it sometimes.
[204:56.52]It just goes...
[205:03.23]where we going I feel like the raptor head is a lot of these barons quests that they just they're designed for you to do the entire time you're in the zone oh you you this is like quicksand you just get style okay um I don't think there's any more this way but since I'm already close to my turn in you run back the way we came I'm just gonna go turn to my warrior and then run back this dude just gave me his like life savings worth of buffs
[205:38.15]Nobody on the alliance goes, shug, shug.
[205:43.55]No, but they do have the beautiful orchestra.
[205:46.67]I don't know if you can compare anything to the Stormwind theme.
[205:55.99]Everybody on the alliance, you just go up and go like, oh, another one of my inventions.
[206:03.27]Yeah.
[206:05.72]But...
[206:08.31]Hey there.
[206:09.83]What can I do for you?
[206:11.93]Hey there.
[206:13.19]That's hard to compete with, too.
[206:31.60]Yeah, light, light, light me with you.
[206:33.64]Light, light me with you.
[206:39.65]What can I, what can I do for you?
[206:42.81]Every time I go into Stormwind, I just try to, like, all the NPCs are just like, hey, I'm walking here.
[206:46.94]And then I'm just like, it makes me fail RP every time.
[206:51.52]I wish I could play a goblin on Alliance.
[206:54.86]Goblins are supposed to be neutral.
[206:56.18]Blizzard screwed up their own lore and they decided to have the goblins pick a side.
[207:06.35]Stupid.
[207:12.73]In Warcraft 3, the Goblin Merchant, there's a Goblin Hero that can be bought by either Horde or Alliance.
[207:29.04]And instead they made it the Pandas that could do that.
[207:40.86]That's a different goblin faction.
[207:43.76]Yeah, and as my brother used to say... They can just open up a fucking portal somewhere.
[207:52.10]And continue to just change whatever they want.
[207:54.26]And do whatever they want.
[207:56.39]I remember when Wrath of the Lich- when Cataclysm was announced.
[207:58.79]Because me and my brother used to play.
[208:02.16]I remember we were like, what the fuck is going on?
[208:03.68]What is a cataclysm?
[208:04.54]Now we're going to Pandaria and later.
[208:06.46]He would say the same thing.
[208:08.34]He'd go, don't worry, dude.
[208:09.18]They're just going to open up a fucking portal somewhere.
[208:11.06]Yeah, they are.
[208:15.70]The World of Warcraft ruined the multiverse before Marvel could.
[208:26.77]All storylines can be solved by a portal opened up and walked in a bad guy.
[208:46.13]I wanted that one.
[208:56.50]Chromie and the Bronze Dragonflight are the ultimate writer's tool.
[209:01.85]Yeah, Chromie ex machina, right?
[209:25.17]Do you know how to get to the hermit who lives east of the crossroads atop the hills?
[209:33.91]East of the crossroads atop... Well, my map is... Somebody may as well have puked and peed on it.
[209:39.84]I can't really read any of that.
[209:48.08]Yeah, getting a little aggressive there, Otto the dog.
[210:08.56]Play Shadowlands on your own time.
[210:11.84]I... Holly and I played for a little bit.
[210:17.10]Well after it came out, and I remember... I thought it was... It's just a lot of the new retail stuff is just... It feels... Okay, WoW retail feels more like an amusement park ride than a game.
[210:42.30]And you know what?
[210:43.63]They have a, it's a giant museum effectively at this point.
[210:47.95]You can time walk every expansion at this point.
[210:52.73]It's been 25 years of content.
[210:54.43]Eventually it's going to have, it's going to be like that.
[210:57.11]Imagine keeping the same game going for 25 straight years with content updates every like six months.
[211:10.35]It's a theme park ride where instead of getting to leave the theme park after you're done, you sign up for your login twice a week job.
[211:19.36]Alright, I got that.
[211:37.89]Did you do the Raptor yet or no?
[211:40.80]uh no we could just hit that it's kind of hard to like target that one we're just gonna have to kill them while we're doing everything else yeah you they're all of it we can go to ratchet too and get some of this stuff as well are you uh all for completely avoiding the uh centaur uh the the coal car leader quest uh I actually did that one on my shaman it's doable it doesn't give you anything though it's like the worst quest in classic
[212:08.88]But we can skip it.
[212:10.70]Yeah, I think you get like some silver for it.
[212:14.10]That's it.
[212:21.09]I just need to go back into the quillboard camp and get like an iron box for the warrior.
[212:26.87]You get an agility ring?
[212:27.93]Oh shit, really?
[212:28.57]Maybe it is worth it to do for you.
[212:32.42]Sorry, what'd you say?
[212:34.38]I just need to go back into the quillboard camps and get like a...
[212:38.06]A steel bar for the warrior quest.
[212:40.63]Oh, OK.
[212:40.81]You can probably also buy it too.
[212:44.07]Can't blacksmith make steel bars?
[212:48.89]Probably.
[212:53.91]It's a four agility, one stamina ring that you get for doing that.
[212:57.02]That quest is so dangerous though.
[212:58.44]I see people die to that a lot.
[213:22.26]I think it's in the camp right next to where we are.
[213:24.70]Or we can just go kill the other things.
[213:29.40]I'm gonna get 13 here.
[213:32.10]Gonna kill the zebras now.
[213:39.46]Yeah, whatever you want to do.
[213:41.20]I'm just trying to honestly just here for the experience, right?
[213:43.98]Just trying to level up.
[213:47.47]Faster we get to 15 or so faster we can do.
[213:50.97]What is it for each bar?
[213:55.53]Go forward to victory.
[214:07.44]I maybe I just haven't been paying attention.
[214:08.76]I feel like I haven't seen I want to.
[214:10.14]I've got to pay more attention to Shadow Bolt grits.
[214:30.20]Would this sell on the auction house?
[214:34.20]I feel like it might.
[214:36.12]30 or 40 silver, probably.
[214:37.83]Probably a lot.
[214:38.31]I'm going to check.
[214:42.93]Wait, that's a regent, right?
[214:58.42]For slow fall.
[214:59.90]Maybe it's worth selling.
[215:05.15]I kind of got a bunch of bullshit still.
[215:11.93]I don't need this anymore.
[215:12.69]Do I this insignia?
[215:14.69]Or do I actually need to keep this for the dungeon quest?
[215:19.80]I feel like we can get rid of it.
[215:21.66]I kept that until level 30 because I just didn't realize it was in my backpack.
[215:27.29]Keep it, keep it.
[215:28.05]People saying, oh my God, keep it.
[215:35.03]Eat it.
[215:38.99]That's good for now.
[215:43.05]Bop it.
[215:44.86]I would hate to delete it and I actually needed it, so.
[215:48.34]I'm going to keep it for a minute.
[215:51.64]We got mail.
[219:00.92]I mean, this is some good shit, but... I can't.
[219:05.71]I already took, like, two pieces of gear from you.
[219:09.11]Yeah, but this was legit gear.
[219:12.19]Yeah, but also, this character's not in Only Fangs.
[219:14.61]I wonder if that'll hold up in the court of Soda Poppin'.
[219:19.39]I mean, first of all, they probably don't care that much, but I have a character in Only Fang, so it would be like if you join it, then it'd be like two guild members trading.
[219:29.77]Oh, that's true.
[219:30.54]That is very true.
[219:40.12]Yeah, at this point, like the level 13, they're like about to do Blackwing Lair.
[219:46.84]Hold on a second, Jerma.
[219:48.74]You took a plus one intellect level 12 piece of gear for pants.
[219:56.02]I feel like that's the... They got bigger fish to fry right now.
[220:05.33]You took one copper?
[220:06.93]Delete your character.
[220:17.52]But I mean, I also don't want to like just skirt on any rules because the rules are there for a reason, so.
[220:21.66]Alright, I'm.
[220:39.43]I think I'm good.
[220:47.32]take every one copper you'll have 50 eventually that's right I think if we um just go back to where we were if you turn in the uh are you on the zebra one uh I was thinking we could just go back to the razor main and then
[221:15.20]Oh yeah, we could kill the geomancers and stuff now, yeah.
[221:18.20]Yeah, I mean, we might be like a little under leveled for that, but there might be other people there.
[221:21.99]I think we'll be alright.
[221:34.81]Wait, this guy usually has cool stuff, doesn't he?
[221:36.31]Holy shit, dude.
[221:42.12]this um take a look at that mace that thing's kind of disgusting the giant one oh the heavy wait yeah look at that oh no no yeah the green just a 73 silver that is way too expensive
[222:13.85]Oh, we gotta go.
[222:14.27]We gotta go this way.
[222:14.79]Can you go to Ratchet too and pick up those other ones?
[222:31.73]I think there's a turn in for Ratchet that we have.
[222:34.91]The Ratchet run was a little scary, so low.
[222:36.97]It's probably fine in a group.
[222:39.27]But there's some like patrols that cross the road.
[222:46.80]And then that alliance level 24 elite pack of four, they're at the lower end, right?
[222:57.67]They walk on the road.
[222:58.55]It's terrifying.
[223:13.84]I think a better bet is when is Otto the dog going to die?
[223:18.73]I mean, if he's on slash follow right now, eventually he goes AFK and we don't realize it.
[223:24.91]And like pulls something.
[223:26.27]Yeah.
[223:28.55]After you, that's not going to happen.
[223:35.12]I could just walk him into like a bunch of enemies.
[223:58.54]Is this guy alright?
[224:00.14]Yeah, you're fine.
[224:00.62]He's a mage.
[224:01.12]Mages are unkillable.
[224:02.98]I think we need to go closer to the road.
[224:11.27]Oh, they don't even spawn here.
[224:15.04]They're up there.
[224:15.58]I forgot.
[224:30.26]I'm coming.
[224:34.62]This looks like Las Vegas.
[224:36.14]It kind of does.
[224:39.91]Need some cactuses and it'll.
[224:49.31]I mean, these razor man, this is like people I pass walking down the street.
[224:55.29]Are you as annoyed as I am that the Quill Boar is you never got to play it as an actual race in the game?
[225:02.76]Would you main the Quill Boar?
[225:04.52]I would love to.
[225:07.04]I think a Quill Boar would be an amazing character to play.
[225:09.62]The problem is the Horde is trying to exterminate the Quill Boar.
[225:13.32]So they would be alliance.
[225:18.05]Get them on the alliance.
[225:20.45]All the Tauren are like...
[225:22.56]We must protect this land.
[225:25.44]Go slaughter the Quilbor.
[225:29.92]Destroy them.
[225:36.18]Quilbor Hunter would be such a fun.
[225:38.52]That'd be a great class to play.
[225:40.66]Alright, this can get really scary.
[225:42.61]Hold on.
[225:45.73]It's just two.
[225:46.41]I'm going to send the Voidwalker on the guy in the back.
[225:50.71]And we'll kill the dude in the front.
[225:51.89]The Defender.
[226:01.97]Oh, right.
[226:03.31]He's automatically set to do that.
[226:09.51]Out of mana?
[226:16.60]What is he doing?
[226:25.78]He's like stuck on the wall.
[226:33.42]Hi Jerma, are you happy?
[226:42.23]Yeah.
[226:44.65]I'm having a good old time here.
[226:46.11]I think I can eat these quillbores too, can't I?
[227:00.89]Yeah, you can.
[227:01.38]They're humanoids.
[227:04.83]This is the moment I realize Rend is gone and the Kiss buff is gone.
[227:10.13]This is very true.
[227:12.03]How much health do you have now, max health?
[227:15.05]428.
[227:27.78]Wait, are we still in free-for-all loot and I'm just taking all loot?
[227:33.18]That's alright.
[227:35.65]All I care about is the EXP.
[227:38.53]Yeah, we lost the kiss buff.
[227:49.63]We don't have it anymore.
[227:59.10]I can interrupt now.
[228:02.61]yeah every love every new rank or every two levels now you should be getting some really good utility up until like level 30. I gotta figure out how to keybind stances but doesn't changing stances like kill your rage it's been so long I really I don't I really don't know what the
[228:29.82]Warrior rotation and warrior abilities do.
[228:32.14]It's been ages.
[228:33.36]I have not.
[228:35.44]I've not even looked at a warrior action bar in probably 15 years.
[228:45.59]OK, we need.
[228:47.59]Two more of the two more defenders.
[228:51.85]Defender over there.
[229:13.92]I like chai tea.
[229:15.60]I gotta be in the mood for it though.
[229:16.88]Chai tea is like a morning coffee kind of drink.
[229:19.00]No, I wouldn't drink a chai tea after 11 o'clock.
[229:47.38]I'm like a black tea kind of guy.
[229:50.07]That's funny because I was just talking about before you got here how much I don't really love black tea.
[229:55.45]I like it if it's a junk food black tea.
[229:59.44]What is junk food black tea?
[230:01.72]Junk food black tea is like brisk, lipton.
[230:06.12]Oh, like sweet tea?
[230:08.21]Well, just the stuff you could buy in the store.
[230:11.01]Grocery store.
[230:11.81]Yeah.
[230:13.27]Black tea.
[230:13.87]Bags of black tea.
[230:15.13]No, just black tea.
[230:17.90]It's a little too bitter.
[230:18.64]So you don't like a good Earl Gray?
[230:22.98]No, it's not that I don't like it.
[230:24.70]I just would prefer the other ones.
[230:26.72]I would prefer green over black.
[230:28.70]Too far away.
[230:30.58]Okay, do you like matcha?
[230:32.56]Yeah.
[230:34.71]See, we just we have different tea palettes and different like drink palettes.
[230:42.78]I think as of now, I drink a lot of.
[230:44.62]Have you ever had rooibos tea?
[230:49.24]No.
[230:50.16]Really good red tea.
[230:54.48]Roibos sounds like something chat would spam.
[230:58.28]Well, they will now.
[230:59.10]It sounds like a made up word.
[231:06.12]What are we looking for here?
[231:07.56]Oh, these supply crates.
[231:16.29]I don't like Jasmine tea.
[231:17.33]I think Jasmine tea is F'd here.
[231:19.57]It's the only tea I would put in F. Oh, we're going to get social aggro.
[231:30.86]Oh, here we go.
[231:44.87]Voidwalker's just fighting a guy over there.
[231:52.97]Mine.
[231:53.57]Just kidding.
[231:54.61]I'll take it, yeah.
[231:56.07]Nah, I got a good one.
[232:10.42]So where are the supplies?
[232:12.30]I think they're just...
[232:14.01]next to the oh they're inside that hut yeah yeah uh hold on a second we're gonna pull yeah there's a we got some shit behind us
[232:44.73]Yeah, jasmine tea tastes like perfume.
[232:47.47]It just, it tastes... True.
[232:49.23]It tastes of old lady perfume.
[232:56.07]You know when you walk by in the department store?
[232:59.55]Oh, you got a couple on you?
[233:06.96]Yeah.
[233:09.14]Just run back to the void bucket.
[233:10.18]Oh, yeah, there you go.
[233:21.41]I tried to heal you and I got... You got one tick and then I got hit by a fireball.
[233:26.87]Oh, definitely take that.
[233:28.37]Pick that up.
[233:33.64]Ooh, yeah.
[233:34.26]Juicy.
[233:35.06]Okay, we need to get this thing.
[233:43.72]Jasmine tea and mango syrup.
[233:47.20]One at a time.
[233:49.42]I don't know if it respawns in the same spawn or a different one.
[233:52.10]It might be different, yeah.
[234:00.67]I'm not a big fan of floral.
[234:02.47]Really floral.
[234:04.89]Nasally floral flavors.
[234:06.41]See, that's interesting because to me, that's what matcha tastes like.
[234:11.12]Oh, shit.
[234:12.88]Oh.
[234:13.04]Oh.
[234:15.83]I mean, plus one shadow spell damage.
[234:19.17]Is that really anything to be excited about?
[234:22.67]I guess it's one extra damage I wouldn't be doing before.
[234:31.80]Yeah, the thing I'm on big time right now is peppermint tea.
[234:34.20]Big time.
[234:47.22]Please, please play League of Legends.
[234:49.40]I told you what my price tag to play League was.
[234:53.00]I wanted $1.5 million to play it for a week.
[234:56.75]And I wanted that because I wanted a million dollars after taxes.
[235:04.51]Should we go look for this at a different spawn?
[235:06.59]Looks like it can be down here.
[235:10.08]Spawns.
[235:14.10]Oh, that map's not going to help.
[235:18.95]The tusk is down there, but we both need that.
[235:26.78]It should just respawn.
[235:35.78]Is it not in that same spot anymore?
[235:38.32]I'm trying to figure out how to like keybind stances.
[235:47.80]Just start running a total donation goal towards League of Legends so that you accumulate it eventually.
[235:56.65]I can't think of a more horrific thing to do on stream than that.
[236:04.06]That's got to be one of the most heinous things I think anyone could ever stream.
[236:10.96]A $1.5 million donation goal to play League of Legends for a week.
[236:15.67]I think that would come across very poorly yeah I would call that repulsive that would be repulsive
[236:50.03]Barrel of milk.
[236:55.26]It spawned right in here.
[237:03.30]Oh, here it is.
[237:06.52]Could do it for charity as well.
[237:08.68]Yeah, that's the only way that I think that would be not.
[237:11.72]It's awful.
[237:14.03]But that's a massive, massive goal.
[237:20.78]We just need to snarl snout.
[237:23.36]I think so.
[237:23.66]I think that's it here.
[237:51.69]Kind of a shit show over here.
[237:54.91]Yeah.
[238:13.57]It's going to spawn in a random spot.
[238:14.95]I think it can be over next to this rock over here.
[238:17.49]In the deep in the camp over there or to the left.
[238:19.43]Probably just sit in one spot.
[238:23.44]Are we going to try and snipe it?
[238:24.66]Are we going to wait for these dudes?
[238:27.46]I'm just going to sit over here.
[238:28.22]I think it can spawn, I think, here.
[238:31.28]Or here, like over this way.
[238:33.44]I've seen it here a few times.
[238:36.38]I'm going to grab some veins of copper.
[238:43.07]I'll just park here for a minute.
[238:50.85]Did you play Balatro?
[238:53.95]Balatro?
[238:55.47]Yeah, it's it's that's like it's like Tomatoes motto.
[238:57.77]What did you do?
[238:58.65]Played it alright?
[239:00.65]I did, but I don't want to upset chat, so I'm going to say I had fun and I enjoyed it and it was it was a very nice game.
[239:06.32]Hold on a minute upset.
[239:08.58]I'm I'm in that category by the way you I you upset me too.
[239:18.23]I said it was a nice, good game.
[239:20.06]You did.
[239:21.32]Wait, dude, Palutro is like cotton candy.
[239:24.02]It's like, who doesn't like cotton candy?
[239:36.05]Get that guy.
[239:40.51]I don't like I don't I don't have any valid criticisms of it other than I played it for six hours and that was enough oh wow you didn't even get to see all the fun stuff it's like okay well that we don't have to talk about it when I started playing it I wanted a game that was actually about poker somehow with like gambling there's gambling in it you gotta unlock all the cards
[240:12.01]There's like 200 jokers to unlock and they do so many cool things.
[240:30.29]Anyway, you tell me about your Bellatra experience instead.
[240:35.99]Uh.
[240:38.47]One day I played it till my eyes hurt and that was a bad.
[240:40.84]That was not good.
[240:44.78]I was laying in bed and I was playing it and I blinked really hard one time and I realized it had been like three hours and I was like, well, my my eyes hurt right now.
[240:52.63]So I stopped for a little while and I went back to it later.
[240:55.25]Took a break.
[241:05.38]Don't see it yet.
[241:06.46]Everyone's here for the same thing.
[241:09.46]Oh yeah.
[241:22.11]I love that game.
[241:22.75]Hey, but you know what?
[241:23.37]Everything doesn't have to be for everybody.
[241:57.59]How do you feel about Slay the Spire?
[242:00.78]I beat Slay the Spire probably four or five times.
[242:03.72]I think my favorite was the poison character.
[242:07.66]But I only played enough to beat it with the warrior and the poison character.
[242:11.66]And then the other character started to get a little too complicated and hard.
[242:16.52]So I said, eh.
[242:19.22]I liked it.
[242:19.64]I thought it was great.
[242:25.11]How do you feel about Slay the Spire 2?
[242:28.64]You are the first person to let me know that that exists.
[242:34.54]Is it out or is it coming out?
[242:36.34]Nah, it's like coming out.
[242:43.63]Why am I life tapping right now?
[242:44.81]That's not a good idea.
[242:50.35]You watched the trailer already.
[242:51.77]Oh, wait, did I?
[242:54.07]yeah it looks exactly like the first game so you might have thought it was just like the refrigerator port re-release you see a thousand video games every day okay it's easy to to just not remember
[243:34.72]Withering Rooms is getting a sequel.
[243:36.62]Now that is something I would love to hear about.
[243:53.96]I think I like more action-y roguelites.
[243:58.58]Or roguelites.
[244:00.42]Like, my goat is into the gungeon.
[244:04.35]Yeah, you put a lot of time into that.
[244:05.69]You liked it a lot, didn't you?
[244:07.21]And, like, Dead Cells.
[244:10.43]And, uh... Can't forget the all-time FTL course.
[244:16.54]What have you been streaming lately?
[244:17.90]What are you usually doing on your stream now?
[244:19.98]Besides, like, being a WoW nerd?
[244:21.72]Yeah, besides World of Warcraft.
[244:28.09]Uh...
[244:30.82]nothing that I resonated with let's say I'm trying to stay positive he hates everything I'm trying I'm trying not to upset people you guys say I hate everything we got the real uh we got the real hater in here oh there it is there it is is it what no that's just some other different orange crates
[244:57.31]What are we even looking for?
[244:59.25]Wait, this is a boss.
[245:00.65]This is not a crate.
[245:01.45]Yeah, we're looking for like a boss.
[245:04.92]Kreenig Snarsnout.
[245:06.98]We've had to kill... We've been just sitting here just killing people and trying to... I was waiting for that.
[245:12.30]Yeah, we're waiting for like a named... It's a named person and they... Okay, he spawns over here apparently.
[245:17.60]This guy, right?
[245:25.15]Oh, his corpse is right here.
[245:33.18]yes I do like risky rain too I didn't play the first one that one is good alright can we get a spawn yeah I was waiting for the I thought we had to pick something up off the ground
[246:06.11]We're just gonna invite people so that way we have a better chance of getting it.
[246:09.75]Yeah, we might as well just invite everybody here.
[246:11.29]Well, we can invite all three of these dudes.
[246:17.16]Yeah, I'm just gonna stand right here.
[246:55.87]Chaos Chris is a stupid name.
[246:57.60]You're gonna be really eating those words when you see the number one on the DPS meter.
[247:11.12]In dog years.
[247:19.01]To answer your question though, the last game I played that I really liked was Project Zomboid, the classic.
[247:26.83]Which just had an update.
[247:29.38]That's another one of those generational video games.
[247:31.50]I feel like it's been in development for a decade.
[247:39.46]Keep adding more and more and more stuff.
[247:42.10]It's in 1.0 now, right?
[247:42.90]Uh, no.
[247:45.97]It's not, really?
[247:46.83]Wow, holy shit.
[247:49.39]That's actually really surprising.
[247:52.17]I would have thought it was in one play at least like a year or two ago.
[248:00.36]It looks really fun.
[248:01.12]I've seen people play it.
[248:02.74]I've seen you play it.
[248:03.54]I've seen Moon Moon play it.
[248:04.56]A lot of people have been playing it.
[248:05.56]It's really funny.
[248:07.54]But it looks complicated.
[248:08.62]It looks like hard and a learning curve.
[248:13.76]It is complicated, but...
[248:16.96]it's not the complication can um it's kind of optional like you don't remember to get into half the systems I tried to play it fairly recently just to install it and be like oh let me check it out and my ui scale was I needed a magnifying glass to read anything oh yeah yeah the resolution
[248:45.81]you probably couldn't read anything on the screen no nothing also these spawns are in if you were like solo here oh you're dead we've just been standing here and there's just people like every three seconds you are not getting out of this alive if you do this alone look how many bodies are on the ground
[249:16.26]And even with this many people, it's still kind of getting overwhelming.
[249:19.12]Yeah, we're sitting outside the spawn door in Team Fortress.
[249:30.67]This is kind of mean.
[249:35.11]But Zomboid does have UI scaling in the options.
[249:41.23]So you can make it bigger.
[249:46.38]But that was actually... That's what got me started on YouTube.
[249:49.65]That was the first video I ever made in 2011.
[249:53.27]Was it the first video ever?
[249:54.77]Yep.
[249:55.37]Wow.
[249:56.70]14 years ago.
[249:57.32]Well, 13 and a half.
[250:00.32]Yeah, I just... There's a lot of menus.
[250:02.50]It just felt like... It felt like every drop-down menu had a separate drop-down menu.
[250:05.69]And I was like, I can't...
[250:15.03]I don't feel like you play survival games too much.
[250:19.99]No, not really.
[250:20.81]Honestly, they kind of take a little too much brainpower.
[250:39.33]I can play those kinds of games with people, but me just doing it as, uh, for fun or whatever, it's, it's hard for me to get into those.
[250:55.70]If the game has more than four buttons, I don't, I'm, yeah, it's not going to work.
[251:03.95]1, 2, 3, 4.
[251:06.99]And I don't even really use this one.
[251:08.17]That's 1, 2, 3, 4.
[251:10.87]Oh my fucking God, I gotta run.
[251:14.17]Get him.
[251:18.38]He's here.
[251:18.76]Alright, we got him.
[251:22.66]Alright, let's get the hell out of here.
[251:28.94]I thought I just got four things spawned on me.
[251:31.27]That was terrifying.
[251:40.38]You always give it a second or two.
[251:41.82]Always give it one or two seconds, you know.
[251:43.82]Because remember, what you said is going to happen to this guy.
[251:47.56]Right?
[251:47.78]See, you turn around and all the people are gone.
[251:51.43]So, let's make sure this guy doesn't get fucking smoked.
[251:55.07]They're level 15.
[251:56.79]Level 15 hunter.
[251:59.35]Yeah, but still.
[252:01.12]The thing you described happened to that guy.
[252:03.30]Alright, we probably want to go back the other way.
[252:09.93]Unless there's another quest over here.
[252:12.49]Oh, it's just the zebras.
[252:16.19]It's the animal stuff and then the fungal spores, but that's... Whaling Caverns is down here.
[252:21.89]We could do the fungal spores in that pool.
[252:28.47]Centaur Bracers is over there too.
[252:29.69]Okay.
[252:36.23]We could do a pit stop too because I kind of need to pee.
[252:56.28]alright let's do it but yeah zomboid is kind of a it's kind of a menu game there's a lot of bags there's a lot of containers
[253:18.38]inventory management turns some people off.
[253:22.86]I don't really love the controls either.
[253:24.70]It feels very, I don't know, like boxy and sloppy.
[253:31.98]I know that's part of the game, right?
[253:33.46]That's intentional.
[253:40.90]Yeah, it's like the isometric kind of WASD.
[253:47.14]it's kind of like exanima in that way just without the physics people were talking about a few people talking about that game the other day yesterday I think exanima get on the road
[254:13.52]I remember like emailing the devs like half a dozen times trying to get them.
[254:17.65]Of Exanima?
[254:18.99]Yeah.
[254:20.35]Giving them feedback or were you looking for new features?
[254:23.41]I was following the dev blogs and stuff back before it was even publicly playable.
[254:28.74]And I was trying to like make a YouTube video on it.
[254:33.20]Looking for, yeah.
[254:38.00]Yeah, back in the day, you used to go like, hello, indie dev, can I play like a shitty version of your game so I can be the first one to make a video on it on YouTube?
[254:46.18]Mm-hmm.
[254:51.70]Yeah, I remember when TF2 would have their weapon updates, they would drop and it'd be like, off to the races.
[254:57.31]I gotta get a video out.
[254:59.57]Alright, what's this weapon?
[255:01.03]10% more damage?
[255:01.49]Okay.
[255:02.75]Hey guys, what's up?
[255:03.25]Sherm here.
[255:03.55]Take a look at this.
[255:04.35]This is the Spicycle.
[255:06.17]Here it is.
[255:06.47]It's got 25% less damage and when you stab people, like, and even trying to get, I'm trying to get gameplay quickly.
[255:14.35]Sometimes I would just suck such ass at that game that a new item would come out and I really wanted to get an update video out quick because you want to get right into the searches and right into the everyone looking for it and I would be playing so badly on my recordings that it's just like this is I fucking I got to do it again.
[255:27.88]I can't even get a backstab with the Spicycle.
[255:31.26]How am I going to talk about this in a video if I can't even use the item?
[255:38.19]There were a couple of rage moments back then.
[255:41.47]doing like a live commentary and you just get shat on in the game so you have to like start it over yeah you have to just pretend that you just started alright how many times do you think what was your record for starting a live commentary like that and starting it over because it went badly uncountable
[256:01.84]I'd say at least a dozen times, yeah.
[256:03.46]For me, it wasn't even hard.
[256:05.24]It wasn't even because it was a multiplayer game and I was doing bad.
[256:08.64]It was just because I kept stumbling.
[256:11.14]Oh, and this game is coming out on... Oh, shit.
[256:15.27]When does it release?
[256:16.31]Okay, start over.
[256:17.27]Yeah.
[256:20.97]Just not being able to speak.
[256:23.41]You get something wrong and you say, wait a minute, I was just talking for a full minute.
[256:28.67]Great.
[256:30.62]Time to redo it.
[256:32.04]Okay, how long is this intro?
[256:33.38]Eight and a half minutes?
[256:34.58]Okay, I should probably do that again.
[256:35.76]Alright, we get anything good for this?
[256:41.28]Kinda.
[256:42.08]I just wish it was cloth.
[256:43.14]What the hell?
[256:45.38]I get a male belt.
[256:47.52]This shit is awesome.
[256:48.46]Why is there nothing for casters?
[256:54.68]Dabu.
[257:02.78]Okay, I'm... I gotta pee.
[257:04.68]I'm gonna get up and stretch and stuff, so... Yeah.
[257:08.16]We back in about... Trying to sell all this shit?
[257:10.80]Yeah, and then we can make our way to, um... That pool area and get the centaur.
[257:18.10]That area is terrifying.
[257:20.10]So we gotta be careful there.
[257:21.22]The coal car?
[257:24.44]Those coal cars are horrible.
[257:26.80]The random patrols that just, like, circle the pond?
[257:30.19]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[257:31.46]And then toss you in a net.
[257:35.66]Yeah, the place sucks.
[257:38.26]Alright, I'll be right back.
[257:45.57]Yeah, I'll see you guys in a few minutes.
[257:53.71]And you should see ads here in a minute.
[257:58.19]Okay, see you soon.
[262:42.81]Is he really playing World of Warcraft?
[262:45.79]This whole stream has just been a figment of your imagination.
[262:53.93]I said a handful of Cheez-Its.
[262:54.89]I'm good.
[263:04.45]Okay.
[263:06.85]So we can go.
[263:07.51]Welcome back.
[263:12.93]Welcome back.
[263:16.89]Alright.
[263:20.13]You know what I could go for right now?
[263:23.39]A peanut butter Reese's cookie.
[263:28.58]Oh, that sounds great.
[263:30.10]Because that's what I just ate.
[263:34.20]Reese's peanut butter cookie?
[263:36.50]Uh-huh.
[263:37.96]That sounds amazing, actually.
[263:41.42]Alright, we go this way.
[263:43.58]Are you good?
[263:43.96]Yeah, I'm good.
[263:48.22]I'm ready.
[263:52.15]What were you gonna say before I like kneecapped you?
[263:59.05]I don't even remember.
[264:02.33]Just overwrote the code.
[264:05.21]That hard drive, that was a fragmented part of the hard drive just got written over.
[264:11.56]Should I sell this?
[264:12.42]Is that... Do any of my spells... I can't even talk.
[264:17.37]Do any of my spells even have the coefficient to even use one shadow spell damage?
[264:26.75]That's a good question for chat.
[264:32.63]So, for instance, Shadow Bolt.
[264:34.39]Does Shadow Bolt do 100% of spell power?
[264:39.72]You can't even use maces.
[264:41.10]I can't?
[264:46.14]Oh, no.
[264:47.78]That's a priest mace.
[264:50.41]Ah, whatever.
[264:51.63]It's fine.
[264:55.79]Let me just make some cloth real quick.
[265:23.12]Do you have an expansion tier list?
[265:24.40]I mean, I've said mine a thousand times, but do you have a preference of which one?
[265:29.42]My expansion tier list is capital D and F. That scared the fuck out of me.
[265:36.62]God.
[265:36.88]Surprise, it's Rend.
[265:40.74]I've only played Classic and Legion.
[265:47.87]Yeah, that's a good list.
[265:49.77]That's a good list.
[265:50.81]The only two I've even played.
[265:55.30]Did you did you play any of like Cataclysm or Miss Bandera or anything like that?
[266:00.94]No, I was playing like.
[266:03.86]Like Halo 2.
[266:09.08]Let's go get these fungal spores.
[266:12.50]Yeah, I got I got a level 60 in vanilla and then I. Kind of just stop playing.
[266:20.18]That's so surprising to me.
[266:23.47]I feel like after level 60 and after WoW was out and then they announced the expansion, I was raring to go.
[266:30.43]I was a wound up engine.
[266:33.97]I couldn't wait for it to come out.
[266:36.67]I like never did anything like post game.
[266:39.33]Never did any like level 60 stuff.
[266:47.59]I loved it.
[266:48.25]Don't get me wrong.
[266:48.96]It wasn't because I didn't like it.
[266:51.31]It was just like TBC came out.
[266:53.61]What like 2007?
[266:54.45]Yeah.
[266:58.54]And then wrath came out.
[266:59.70]I think in only a year or two later, like 2009, they came out pretty quickly next to each other.
[267:05.50]So we were playing vanilla for like about three years.
[267:10.12]If it was out for because they did.
[267:12.00]Molten core.
[267:14.46]Blackwing layer.
[267:16.34]Then.
[267:16.72]So garub AQ 40.
[267:21.61]Alright, I will explain why I didn't play the Burning Crusade.
[267:27.11]And uh, this is gonna hurt a lot of people's brains.
[267:29.87]Because it's gonna reinforce the notion that we had it so good back then.
[267:35.58]Uh, because in 2007 I was playing Mass Effect, Portal, Crysis, Halo 3, Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare, Uncharted, Drake's Fortune, Assassin's Creed.
[267:49.38]I could go on.
[267:50.61]The orange box came out in, what, 2007?
[267:52.71]2006?
[267:52.73]So yeah, there was a lot of good stuff.
[267:58.87]It kind of... We were spoiled rotten little shits, weren't we?
[268:06.59]Oh yeah, like 2004 to 2000 and like... 9 or 10 were just... Every year... Was incredible.
[268:16.83]Like, I was probably actually... Most of my time was probably just spent in skate.
[268:23.31]I forgot that's back in the Halo glory days.
[268:30.00]Or like the original crackdown.
[268:31.84]Is this the one we're skipping or the one we're doing?
[268:40.25]We could do the ones leading up to it.
[268:41.97]I'm just terrible.
[268:42.63]Okay, if there's like 10 people with us, then maybe we could do it.
[268:45.59]But we can do the initial stuff.
[268:53.47]The initial stuff I think is just kills.
[269:17.80]Got Crackdown for the Halo 3 beta.
[269:19.75]It turned out Crackdown is also fun.
[269:27.45]Yeah, Crackdown was awesome.
[269:30.17]Didn't they really drop the ball in Crackdown?
[269:32.10]The new Crackdown sucked, right?
[269:33.70]It was one of the worst games they ever made, right?
[269:35.54]Crackdown 1 and 2 are both goaded.
[269:39.34]They're like the games that started the collect-a-thon fever, from what I remember.
[269:46.45]I just remember in Crackdown, couldn't you just jump around and smash into buildings and didn't everything just, everything in the whole world was destroyable, right?
[269:56.24]You were basically like a superhero.
[270:00.12]You could like Hulk jump everywhere.
[270:02.18]Alright, be careful with these level 15 dudes.
[270:07.37]This is the boss quest.
[270:08.77]That's the one that gets people killed over there.
[270:11.15]Just move.
[270:11.97]Just leave.
[270:17.63]I think we still need zebras anyway.
[270:18.99]Yeah, we need zebras.
[270:24.43]You're on the zebra.
[270:25.26]Yeah, you are.
[270:34.17]What are my plans if I die?
[270:35.57]I have other characters that I could just log on to.
[270:40.29]Or I could just do it again and play... I would do a priest if I was to die.
[270:51.10]I'm not gonna die though.
[271:11.15]Save the mace for the priest.
[271:13.57]That's true.
[271:20.27]Raptors.
[271:36.58]What was that game where you got the electricity superpowers?
[271:39.12]I don't know.
[271:40.92]Infamous?
[271:44.80]A few of those games came out.
[271:46.00]It was Prototype, Infamous.
[271:48.02]They were very similar.
[271:48.94]Yeah, I mean, Prototype 1 and 2 are just still some of the best games ever made, I think.
[272:04.55]City Heroes.
[272:05.43]You played City Heroes, didn't you?
[272:06.87]Oh, yeah.
[272:08.15]You were a fan of that game, weren't you?
[272:11.41]Yeah, I was.
[272:13.57]Proto live streams.
[272:16.27]I would listen to like a City of Heroes web radio where they would like take song requests from the other people in the IRC channels.
[272:28.80]That's awesome.
[272:29.12]That were just like playing.
[272:32.88]And there was like a DJ playing.
[272:37.09]and then everyone would just sit in the IRC channels and just slap each other with trout we thought it was the funniest shit that's so fun uh let's head to the oasis but yeah city of heroes uh champions online all that
[273:04.84]My first MMO was Dark Age of Camelot.
[273:10.82]Why do I have a weird memory of that game of it existing, but for some reason not existing in my brain?
[273:17.70]Yeah, I mean, it's the same for me.
[273:19.02]I was like a little child.
[273:22.76]I don't remember anything except when I was a stupid kid who'd never played MMO before and I thought the starter area, like I didn't know how to leave.
[273:33.88]You're just stuck in the tutorial zone?
[273:34.88]I didn't know how to get out of the starter zone, yeah.
[273:37.04]So I would just kill the tutorial enemies and that was like fun enough.
[273:42.85]That's funny.
[274:03.08]I was asked this... There's dead bodies here.
[274:06.67]Caution.
[274:08.73]Did you ever play RuneScape?
[274:09.83]We talked about it yesterday.
[274:10.75]I was curious if you have ever played it.
[274:13.65]I have never played RuneScape, but I probably would like it.
[274:27.90]Shit, I've ripped aggro.
[274:28.94]Have you played?
[274:31.20]No, never.
[274:38.23]I feel like there weren't that many people, maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like there weren't that many people who were dedicated to both Vanilla WoW and RuneScape at the same time.
[274:49.98]I feel like that's like having two families and living two different lives at the same time.
[274:56.68]You get in a car and you drive across town and you go with your other family.
[275:07.04]Because Runescape needs a lot of time investment too, doesn't it?
[275:11.76]Oh yeah, no, it's... Some of the grinding in Runescape would make WoW blush.
[275:17.60]Yeah, some stuff takes weeks to level up.
[275:20.50]Even one point.
[275:22.92]I just made that up.
[275:23.92]Hopefully I didn't sound like an idiot.
[275:25.70]I just made that up.
[275:34.73]Think about how many, like, families RuneScape was, like, their child care services.
[275:42.28]Like, oh, don't worry about Johnny.
[275:44.40]He's addicted to RuneScape.
[275:46.12]He's not doing anything bad.
[275:47.50]I know exactly where he is.
[275:49.82]Yeah, he was probably doing wicked bad shit on RuneScape.
[276:02.84]Yeah, he was probably scamming people on RuneScape and the mother didn't even know.
[276:06.64]Yeah, my mom never wondered where I was because I was just sitting my ass on the computer chair playing RollerCoaster Tycoon.
[276:16.15]I remember getting scammed in D2.
[276:19.91]I got scammed more than once.
[276:21.91]I was a fucking idiot.
[276:28.41]Oh, like with the, uh, with the tray dropping?
[276:31.77]No, the ring trick got me once and I couldn't believe it.
[276:38.05]Oh, we got the patrol behind us.
[276:39.13]Careful.
[276:46.02]Yeah, for those of you who don't know, the ring trick was in Diablo II, there's only three or four art assets for every ring in the game.
[276:53.98]They could be different rings, but just the actual art itself.
[276:58.42]So the scam was you would open up a trade with somebody, put in a stone of Jordan.
[277:03.30]Hey, I want to try to do this with a stone of Jordan.
[277:06.18]And, oh yeah, that sounds great.
[277:07.37]And then you'd put up the thing that they wanted.
[277:09.59]And then they'd say, oh, hold on a second.
[277:10.81]I got like my bags.
[277:12.01]I got no space.
[277:12.79]I got to go to my storage.
[277:14.85]And they'd talk to you for a few minutes, be friendly.
[277:17.27]Sometimes they'd even play with you for a little while.
[277:18.67]Like, you know what?
[277:19.39]Hey, let's do a Mephisto run.
[277:21.73]Just, you know, to gain the trust.
[277:23.33]It was diabolical.
[277:25.67]And then they would say, okay, yeah, I got, I'm all cleared out.
[277:28.39]I'm ready to go.
[277:29.58]And they would wait for you to put your item in.
[277:32.24]And then they would take, instead of the Stone of Jordan, they would take some shit, like white or magic ring that just sucked, the same art file, the same art asset.
[277:42.53]They'd put that in and they'd click the button, the accept trade button.
[277:47.75]And it's like, oh yeah, of course, there it is.
[277:50.88]Just hoping you wouldn't like mouse over it a second time.
[277:53.18]Just hoping you wouldn't mouse over it.
[277:54.38]And sometimes they would do it more than once.
[277:55.91]They would say, they would trick you to say, oh, hey, I actually, I got some more, I need some more space.
[278:00.29]Again, it was a, just repeat that once or twice.
[278:04.77]And then, oh, there it is.
[278:05.95]I'm kind of, alright, dude, like I want to get this over with, like, let's go to try to hurry you up.
[278:19.07]And then they would get all your stuff.
[278:20.67]The other one was they filled you with... It was like, oh, hey, man, I got a dupe.
[278:25.03]I know how to dupe in Diablo.
[278:26.75]And when you're 14, you hear that and you go, wait, what do you mean I can dupe?
[278:34.12]Oh, that's pretty good.
[278:36.90]That's pretty good.
[278:43.44]And they had you fill your inventory with potions.
[278:47.83]I think this is the one you were just talking about.
[278:49.25]The one where they make you pop.
[278:50.93]Oh, yeah.
[278:52.30]It was such... It was so awful.
[278:55.78]Uh... Yeah, so you would... They'd say fill your entire inventory with potions.
[279:00.99]And something about the way that Diablo II worked... It didn't like the fact that you had no space...
[279:07.93]in your inventory and if you died a couple times you would drop potions and your belt had to be full your inventory had to be full of potions and eventually I don't remember the exact math of how it worked or why it worked but if you did that a few times instead of duping all of your gear you dropped every fucking item you had on and they would just pick it all up and leave ooh there you go
[279:37.59]Spirit better than the one in, though?
[279:38.91]I don't know.
[279:43.92]There was also the telekinesis through the wall at the rogue encampment.
[279:47.26]That was another I can dupe trick.
[279:50.48]They would tell you to drop something in a very specific corner.
[279:54.61]And they could be outside the rogue encampment.
[279:56.43]And the scam was, I'm outside.
[279:59.23]I'm not even in the town.
[280:00.71]There's a wall between us.
[280:01.91]How would I steal that?
[280:04.73]And they would use telekinesis and pick the item up and just leave.
[280:13.05]Because telekinesis, you could pick up an item if you casted telekinesis at an item.
[280:18.21]And if you were in town, you can't cast spells in town.
[280:24.12]Or maybe, could telekinesis be used in town?
[280:26.64]It might have been able to be used in town.
[280:27.88]But it was like, oh, look, see, I'm not in town.
[280:31.26]I lost a lot of good items.
[280:33.03]Because I was a dumb, naive, stupid kid.
[280:37.65]And wanted to cheat.
[280:40.49]Is the moral of that story.
[280:42.90]I don't know if we want to fight all three of these at the same time.
[280:47.74]We could probably get the two, but let's wait.
[280:57.07]I'm going to send Voidwalker on the Wrangler and we'll kill the Stormer.
[281:01.01]That thing is dangerous.
[281:12.26]Yeah, that move is horrible.
[281:26.76]I remember this quest being a huge pain in the ass.
[281:29.06]It takes forever to get these.
[281:30.66]To be honest, most of the Barrens is, but I don't think Silverpine is much better.
[281:35.66]No, I think Silverpine might be worse because the Argyle.
[281:40.23]I'm just gonna grab some copper real quick.
[281:42.17]Wanna buy pants off me.
[281:54.40]Wait, what?
[281:56.28]No, this auto guy is like, wanna buy pants off me.
[282:01.41]Bro, I'm broke, man.
[282:02.73]Auto.
[282:06.19]Auto.
[282:29.88]void walker is so good yeah if I could have the imp out and do more damage but it's just so much safer to roll around with the void walker oh yeah like comparatively uh
[282:50.26]Warrior and Shaman.
[282:52.43]Oof.
[282:53.39]It hurts.
[282:56.01]Yeah, you have a stronger will than I do.
[282:59.03]I definitely think Warrior would be, in hardcore, a class I would not want to play.
[283:04.17]It is the best class in Classic.
[283:05.76]It is, by far, the best all around.
[283:08.88]But getting there is... too scary for me.
[283:15.18]I paid 10 silver for the pants.
[283:19.95]That's very scary over there.
[283:21.07]We should go this way.
[283:31.57]Probably still scam though.
[283:42.36]I lost interest at 42 and I'm fighting the urge to play again.
[283:48.88]Just because you're old doesn't mean you can't play.
[283:50.78]What was it?
[283:53.34]They said just because you're old doesn't mean you can't play.
[283:55.42]Oh, are they saying that they're 42 years old?
[284:01.04]Wait, are they talking about like their level?
[284:04.81]I think that's level 42.
[284:08.39]It's an old game.
[284:09.71]I don't know.
[284:15.77]But yeah, there is a stretch of this game.
[284:19.73]From, I would say, level 28 to 38.
[284:24.04]At least on the Horde side, it feels like.
[284:29.28]Is... It's kind of rough.
[284:33.34]There's not a whole lot of great places to level.
[284:35.58]You could go do dungeons, but those are scary.
[284:39.50]Desolace is one of the most terrifying places.
[284:41.66]It's scary.
[284:44.52]Stranglethorn is terrifying, but I don't think you could even go to Stranglethorn until 35, really.
[284:52.90]Yeah, you pretty much like hard stuck in Barrens or you go to Silver Pine, that's it.
[284:58.89]And then even if you do everything in the Barrens, it's not enough to stay like high enough level.
[285:04.35]Yeah, the Stone Talon will bring you to 27, 28-ish.
[285:08.17]And then Ashen Veil can get, but you have to go to the Alliance territory.
[285:12.70]It's between like 28 and 35, which is kind of hard to get a good quest roll going.
[285:22.77]Thousand Needles.
[285:23.39]Yeah, Thousand Needles is good too, but Thousand Needles sucks.
[285:28.86]That might be the worst zone in Warcraft.
[285:35.40]Thousand Needles is like they took the map editing tool to raise in lower land and just held left click and said, tell me when, like the Parmesan guy in Olive Garden.
[285:47.17]It really does feel like that.
[285:48.05]They're 3,000 feet in the air for no reason.
[285:52.49]And they're so hard, you can fall off that.
[285:55.21]The bridges, those are not sturdy.
[286:03.88]Get the mushrooms on the outside.
[286:05.46]I could fish in this water.
[286:12.51]Do I have a fishing pool?
[286:17.59]Oh, I didn't get one, no.
[286:18.85]I didn't buy one.
[286:25.28]Has the game done any graphic updates?
[286:29.21]Yeah, this is just the default.
[286:30.97]No, these are the updates.
[286:34.19]Yeah, because Cataclysm had the updates, right?
[286:38.74]Yeah, like actually you can go into options and turn the water back down and it's pretty funny.
[286:43.28]Really?
[286:44.20]To vanilla.
[286:50.27]Somebody said they were a fan.
[286:51.35]Where are you?
[286:56.99]oh there you are go to um if you want to see the real vanilla go to your graphic settings oh and just turn everything down uh especially the environment detail in the middle box I'm on ultra
[287:21.79]I think it requires a game restart, though, to do all the crazy stuff.
[287:25.17]Not if you just do the environment detail at the bottom.
[287:29.73]And if you turn that to zero, and then you can turn the... It's like liquid or something.
[287:38.87]Oh, environment.
[287:39.43]There it is.
[287:41.54]And ground clutter.
[287:43.16]It turned liquid detail on that same, at the top of that box.
[287:47.50]Oh, yeah.
[287:48.94]It just deletes all the trees and all the mountains.
[287:51.58]Yeah, that's the actual vanilla.
[287:57.92]Be careful.
[287:58.54]This is how pros play Counter-Strike.
[288:02.68]You gotta put every setting to low.
[288:04.78]And do use DirectX 8.
[288:05.84]I actually kind of like it.
[288:10.83]Weirdly enough.
[288:13.89]Yeah, you've always kind of like the less effects and stuff on the screen, the better I feel like for you.
[288:20.74]Yeah, too much bullshit just kind of gets annoying.
[288:22.76]I think we have to actually swim in the middle of this and it will complete something.
[288:32.05]There we go.
[288:52.40]I'm pretty sure the servers are way bigger now too, because I remember lagging in the capital cities, but it's still like, I feel like there's way more people now.
[289:03.42]With the introduction of layering and the servers stacked on top of each other and phasing into other people's layers when it's convenient.
[289:12.49]Yeah, there's so much more room to run into people now.
[289:15.85]Like when I'm in Orgrimmar, I have a 4090 and I still have to look at the ground to get framerate.
[289:26.72]Yeah, sometimes it can be what feels like thousands of people in the major cities.
[289:34.75]We need mushrooms.
[289:44.33]Oh, this quest.
[289:47.97]Oh yeah, the mushrooms one sucks.
[289:55.28]Usually they spawn faster than this.
[289:56.84]Maybe we should get layered.
[290:05.15]Yeah, let's get layered.
[290:06.75]Let's see.
[290:13.07]Anybody got one of those layers?
[290:22.34]Thank you.
[290:28.45]Appreciate it.
[290:31.59]Oh, I'm not the party leader.
[290:32.47]There you go.
[290:35.49]Thank you.
[290:45.90]I found one mushroom on the old one.
[290:47.74]Yeah, there's a bunch here.
[290:50.54]Wait, can we get rend all the way out here?
[290:53.76]Nah, you gotta be in Crossroads.
[290:55.22]You just hear him yelling?
[290:56.06]Oh, we can just hear him.
[290:57.02]Okay.
[290:57.44]I was gonna say, what?
[290:59.14]That's kind of awesome.
[291:02.13]No, that's just to taunt you.
[291:03.63]That's just like, oh shit, I just missed Rind.
[291:06.53]Damn.
[291:12.37]Sorry to this hunter.
[291:22.70]I got one.
[291:34.80]I thought that was wrench for a second.
[291:36.16]I was like, holy shit, we got it.
[291:56.35]Need one more?
[291:57.13]I need two.
[292:02.74]A lot of people out here sniping things.
[292:10.59]The more people that pick them up, usually the better.
[292:16.29]When is the Succubus?
[292:16.97]Succubus is... 20?
[292:17.81]22?
[292:17.83]I think it's 20.
[292:22.22]When is Fel Hunter?
[292:25.82]30? 40?
[292:41.82]Give me.
[292:42.98]There's one behind you.
[292:44.58]You missed the other one.
[292:45.79]Oh, shit.
[292:49.67]I'm out of range.
[292:53.19]Yes, spawned right in front of you, but because of your greed, you turned to try to steal from me instead.
[293:00.57]Yep, that's what I get.
[293:03.03]I didn't deserve to get that one.
[293:04.43]Alright, I got them all.
[293:09.36]I just need one more.
[293:20.36]This is an interesting question.
[293:21.58]Have you ever platinumed a game?
[293:22.88]And if so, which one?
[293:24.12]I don't think I've ever.
[293:24.76]Platinumed?
[293:27.82]Is that a PlayStation user?
[293:30.30]I guess the term can be translated to 100% complete any game.
[293:36.56]Have you ever 100% completed a game?
[293:42.21]Oh, definitely, yeah.
[293:44.97]I don't think I ever have.
[293:45.75]I usually get to somewhere around 70% to 80% completion, and then I'm like, nah, I'm good.
[293:51.10]I think a lot of mine won't count why not they used to do I used to do like achievement hunting on Xbox oh I would rent games from gamefly with the express purpose of getting them in the mail just because they had like easy achievements so you were going for the high gamer score you were going for I wanted I wanted the gamer score okay
[294:28.85]Do you have it on Bloodborne?
[294:30.95]I don't think so because I didn't do the Chalice Dungeon stuff.
[294:33.83]I never got into it.
[294:35.51]And I'm sure at least a handful of those were trophies for Chalice Dungeons.
[294:50.96]Your hands are just on fire for me.
[294:54.59]Like you're just doing a permanent cast.
[294:57.43]Now that's when your hands get stuck in jazz hands mode.
[295:01.97]Who did the enchant on those?
[295:09.18]I'm just going to hang out and try to grab one more of these stupid mushrooms.
[295:16.52]Yeah, I played the chalice dungeons, but I never.
[295:20.36]You could go pretty deep.
[295:21.89]I did them pretty shallow.
[295:23.37]I only did a few of them.
[295:25.73]There were bosses in the Chalice Dungeons that were very unique that were not in the regular game.
[295:30.68]They weren't reskins.
[295:31.90]They were completely unique encounters.
[295:33.46]It was actually kind of amazing.
[295:37.26]I learned about that months later after playing it.
[295:40.20]Yeah, I remember doing a few Chalice Dungeons and I feel like you had to get through the easy ones to get to the actual challenging ones, right?
[295:55.02]Like, if you tried to do them all with your, like, in-game character, weren't there, like, some really easy ones at the beginning or something?
[296:01.58]Yeah, you could also... I think you had to pick up consumable... There's a consumable... You had to use stuff.
[296:08.74]You had to get the... They were, like, I don't even... I can't remember what the hell the things were called.
[296:13.96]Like, oil cans and eyeballs and... You got, like, the actual little chalices from the end of some of the dungeons.
[296:21.48]The tomb mold, yeah, that stuff.
[296:31.34]Oh, layer me.
[296:31.90]Do you want to get layered?
[296:33.88]We could do it.
[296:40.38]Let's give it 10 seconds.
[296:41.44]Oh, there's one.
[296:53.73]You got it.
[296:55.67]You got it.
[296:56.13]Come on.
[297:07.80]It's actually a really good place to fish.
[297:11.82]There's like some special fish that come spawn here.
[297:16.78]What level do you need to do it?
[297:21.65]I don't know.
[297:24.39]But I think you can get the fish to let you transform into a pirate.
[297:30.25]Oh, that's popular because you could be a human as a horde.
[297:33.65]Yes, you get to be a little human in disguise.
[297:38.46]We got a couple things to turn in.
[297:39.70]Do you want to grind out the centaur bracers or do you want to just get out of here?
[297:45.37]I mean, XP is XP, so.
[297:47.49]It's true.
[298:02.98]The beast claws were unique to the chalice dungeons.
[298:07.97]Thought it was a cool reward for exploring them.
[298:11.87]It was sort of a whole nother game.
[298:13.57]It was a totally different experience.
[298:19.38]I think at that point, I just, every time I play Bloodborne, I finish it.
[298:23.60]I go, man, I rub my hands together and I say, what a game that was.
[298:28.06]And then I'm done.
[298:30.00]Jump for the patrol right here.
[298:31.64]We're going to get it.
[298:35.46]Let the Voidwalker fight the one on the left.
[298:47.30]Very good.
[298:47.70]Very nice.
[298:48.18]Okay.
[299:03.16]I can't tell when you're going to attack because you're just constantly in the casting state.
[299:10.29]If you do slash reload, will it reload your UI and everything?
[299:14.85]Let's find out.
[299:18.46]I'm going to send the Voidwalker on the Wrangler.
[299:22.14]And no, I am not.
[299:26.64]There's a Wrangler behind.
[299:28.46]Let's not pull three.
[299:31.91]Will that guy aggro up there at this point?
[299:35.07]If the Voidwalker's in the tent, does the line of sight matter?
[299:39.57]Depends on if the tent is considered a solid or not.
[299:42.39]Is the tent a solid object?
[299:44.03]That is the real question.
[299:48.85]Well, I think we can just pull him anyways.
[299:51.15]Yeah, go around here.
[300:00.68]Let's line aside him a little.
[300:03.00]If I melee him, he stops doing the bow, so I can just drag him back.
[300:13.02]OK, now we can take these two.
[300:34.72]treating three mobs like a raid boss hey let me tell you people die here people people run in there and go alright we got it they pull three and then somebody panics it's not enough you don't have a heal oh and auto's ringing his water bell let me get to a safe place calling room service
[301:06.97]I think it's safe over here.
[301:08.07]Let's go up in the mountain.
[301:12.37]I think one of the patrols kind of goes over the mountain.
[301:15.10]Do they run over it?
[301:17.62]What if we hide over here?
[301:18.44]Okay, I'm going to put them on defensive mode.
[301:22.48]Okay.
[301:30.69]We're safe right here.
[301:31.43]I'll be back in one minute.
[301:39.02]Alright, chat.
[301:53.83]Where's the world boss in this zone?
[301:55.77]I'm bringing him back.
[302:15.61]Tell us a funny story.
[302:17.15]Okay.
[302:23.94]Wait.
[302:29.69]Why?
[302:29.93]He's not telling a joke.
[302:31.45]Did Torrin not get jokes?
[302:56.32]I did, yeah, I'm doing slash silly and nothing's happening.
[303:03.17]He's just doing the like, I'm telling a story animation without actually telling us, wait, shit, that's what I'm doing right now.
[303:31.55]You guys think that I'm young enough to remember stories?
[303:37.19]Listen, the hair on my head is gonna be fading in the next couple years.
[303:44.08]I can't remember anything from the day before after I wake up.
[303:55.28]You guys ever think about like if you go to sleep,
[303:59.26]When you lose consciousness, it's like a new you wakes up with all the memories of the old you imprinted.
[304:06.03]And how would you tell?
[304:27.18]Alright.
[304:27.86]I think I could hear you.
[304:29.36]I think the reason for that was I was alt-tabbed, so it turned off all the sound in the game.
[304:36.09]No, like, I couldn't hear them in my game.
[304:38.71]Oh, really?
[304:39.53]It's not making it.
[304:40.39]See if it doesn't.
[304:43.01]Moo.
[304:44.07]Are you happy now?
[304:46.17]Yeah.
[304:47.41]Well, I can't hear it.
[304:48.64]It's not speaking for me.
[304:50.36]Did you have speech or dialog audio down or something?
[304:55.66]No, I have dialog maxed.
[304:57.38]Hmm.
[304:59.56]That's messed up.
[305:06.52]Probably shouldn't pull without knowing what's in this tent.
[305:20.39]Raptors.
[305:33.37]Ding.
[305:33.97]Fourteen.
[305:34.69]Let's go.
[305:36.63]Let's go.
[305:37.45]I can't believe they stole LFG from us.
[305:49.47]LFG?
[305:49.95]Like looking for group?
[305:50.65]I mean that's what it was.
[305:53.00]Now it's let's fucking go.
[305:56.64]Got stolen.
[305:57.28]I think it could have a double... could have a double meaning.
[306:05.73]is LOL like lots of laughs or lots of or laugh out loud or is it lots of love I think if anybody writes lots of love as an LOL I don't think they've spent more than one hour on the internet yeah but but in the old old internet days that was one of the people said LOL for lots of love back in like the 90s they did
[306:34.34]yeah like in the in like the AOL chat rooms and shit I don't remember sorry about your grandma LOL yeah that's that's that's crazy
[307:07.98]get him out of the tent what I what I said that's early I said that's crazy but yeah the uh the only people who said LOL is lots of love were like the old people like my grandpa they didn't know it meant laugh out loud or
[307:35.57]anything like that so they it was like a based on a misunderstanding it was like old people in chat rooms dude how is this wand worse than the one I have level five versus level seven that's kind of unfortunate
[308:09.04]Oh, you could expunge your previous sins.
[308:12.60]Use the new wand.
[308:22.08]You ever think about how one day we're going to be in like retirement home sitting in like a like a Logitech gaming chair with like a Razer headset?
[308:33.32]Yeah.
[308:37.04]I think I would probably just get into reading books or something.
[308:40.86]I feel like I'd be too slow at that point to do any major... You're in your 70s, 80s, 90s.
[308:45.93]I don't know.
[308:48.11]I feel like I'm going to be slower.
[308:49.83]I'd rather just read a book.
[308:50.87]What do you mean no way I would read a book?
[309:05.69]I read the entire Song of Ice and Fire series.
[309:09.07]And I comprehended it.
[309:11.96]Yeah, but he wrote those like 20 years ago.
[309:17.59]Yeah, but I still comprehended it.
[309:20.29]Okay, but like real talk, when was the last time you read a full book?
[309:23.11]Because for me, I'm not trying to call you out here, but for me, it's been like since the Song of Ice and Fire books, which I remember reading and talking with you about every day in like 2017.
[309:34.72]Like, I don't think I've read a full book in like eight years.
[309:39.92]No, I haven't either.
[309:42.33]I don't, I feel like that has any good, I'm such a bandwagon piece of shit when it comes to books.
[309:50.28]There has to be a book series that is, you've got to check it out.
[309:58.78]Oh, that's true.
[309:59.32]I did read a book about eels.
[310:08.02]The Expanse?
[310:09.82]You really liked The Expanse.
[310:11.72]The Expanse was a book?
[310:13.93]I haven't read it, but I love the TV show.
[310:19.76]TV show's goated.
[310:24.28]Yeah, my problem with the book is the difference between a book and a movie, or a book and a TV show.
[310:30.50]Wait, this dude's gonna die.
[310:32.19]Oh my god, who?
[310:32.75]Oh, okay.
[310:37.35]I don't even know if that was intentional, by the way.
[310:42.75]I think that was on accident.
[310:48.93]uh okay what was I saying books so if you watch a movie and the movie sucks or the movie whatever whatever your opinion of the movie is it took you about what like an hour and 20 minutes to like two hours to to understand that and know that reading a whole book let's say it's a three four hundred page book sometimes can take up to a week or two
[311:17.53]So I kind of don't want to know if I like something by slowly going through it for like three weeks.
[311:22.77]But what if the book is better than the movie?
[311:25.15]That I could be.
[311:31.59]It takes 30 minutes to get to the part of the movie where I go, this movie sucks, but it might take like a week in a book.
[311:39.01]This is going to be an interesting fight.
[311:40.91]Oh, yes it is.
[311:41.41]Okay, I'm going to send Voidwalker on the Wrangler on the right.
[311:45.79]Kill this first Stormer.
[311:46.77]Go to that second Stormer.
[311:50.05]I have potions if need be.
[311:54.51]I've got to get out of that, first of all.
[312:00.41]Okay, we're good.
[312:13.74]See, look at how much they trust how good we're playing.
[312:16.28]I didn't even see a single 0-7.
[312:17.48]Not one.
[312:19.69]We also have like 300 HP from red.
[312:23.73]For 14 more minutes.
[312:29.49]You take every fight so seriously, it's making me laugh.
[312:31.88]This is hardcore, man.
[312:33.78]It's so easy to die here.
[312:36.64]All it takes is one or two crits from one of those stormers and Alex is dead.
[312:42.21]Okay, but, like, chat hasn't thought about it from this perspective.
[312:44.69]Think about who's playing.
[312:47.22]We stream video games for a living, therefore attention span is at least 25% of the average person.
[312:52.92]So if we don't do 100% of our ability, which is, like, 50% of yours, we're gonna die.
[312:59.09]Yeah.
[313:02.35]It's, like, one to two steps above the, like, baby mode.
[313:06.53]Hmm.
[313:12.11]People think we're going to die.
[313:13.27]I'm not going to die before level 20.
[313:15.35]I'm going to live.
[313:18.07]And I'm going to live long enough... To at least see the inside of... Razorfen Crawl.
[313:30.22]So have you seen the Expanse?
[313:32.38]No.
[313:33.98]Oh.
[313:34.08]We gotta... We gotta fix that.
[313:39.64]You... You actually would like it.
[313:41.53]you just have to get through the first like three episodes it's a it's about space yeah I say space is not my favorite genre but well it's not like Star Wars yeah it's like it's like semi near future space
[314:11.55]It's about the future.
[314:20.08]I feel like I've been level 13 for two days.
[314:22.10]Well, I mean, that's just not true.
[314:26.87]You were like barely level 11 yesterday, right?
[314:30.35]Yeah, but I feel like I... You're getting all the experience because you're a warrior.
[314:36.08]No, look at all... I don't think that's how that works.
[314:40.12]It's proximity.
[314:41.46]It's whoever's closest when the thing dies.
[314:43.36]So you're melee.
[314:43.96]You get an extra 20%.
[314:44.44]Alright, let's just take all six of these at the same time.
[314:46.18]We got to get the XP back.
[314:47.28]Oh my God.
[314:53.77]Tab targeting.
[314:54.47]What are you doing?
[314:55.13]Why are you tab targeting a guy over there?
[315:00.67]You get slightly less XP, but you get to kill everything twice as fast.
[315:30.08]Uh, take like three steps back.
[315:31.36]Because we're going to pull four people if we're not careful and it's going to be fucking ugly.
[315:41.07]Keep him on this fleet.
[315:42.99]Uh, yeah, run back here.
[315:44.87]Because there's a lot of people here.
[315:47.77]There's one coming around the right, one coming around the left.
[315:51.96]Okay, we're good.
[315:53.48]That was scary.
[315:58.93]alright so the expanse is like game of thrones in space okay so that's the straight elevator pitch there is it imagine game of thrones in space kind of yeah but a lot a lot less incest okay
[316:26.72]There's a good potion over there.
[316:34.63]How come you're clicking a bunch of spells?
[316:35.91]Look at the title!
[316:56.15]I'm surprised we haven't gotten a, uh, key.
[316:57.55]They drop a... Don't they drop, like, a booty key?
[317:00.64]Oh, yeah, for the, uh, chests up on the tower.
[317:03.76]Uh, this is... The last TV show you watched.
[317:09.10]The last TV show?
[317:10.08]That you liked.
[317:11.30]Hmm.
[317:14.50]This dude is level 16, by the way.
[317:17.24]We got him.
[317:25.07]got nothing on us we're good last TV show um nothing that recently I don't think I mean honestly I've just been putting on old infomercials and falling asleep to them there's a good portion on here
[318:00.97]What is this?
[318:01.79]Oh, we got to kill Kodobane?
[318:03.87]Apparently Kodobane is over there somewhere.
[318:06.69]We missed him.
[318:07.07]I think he's up here.
[318:11.74]Oh, yeah.
[318:12.04]He's like in that tower, maybe.
[318:13.20]Just going to kill this last dude.
[318:16.02]Do you remember claiming that you could run 80 to 90 miles per hour?
[318:33.01]Yeah, I mean, when I've had like four drinks and we just are talking shit and I, maybe I exaggerated a little.
[318:46.95]In my prime, I would have been on, I could have been on one of those TV shows where they put a guy on a track and field track with a cheetah and they just have them both run at the same time.
[318:59.98]I'd probably lose to the cheetah, but not by very much.
[319:09.66]Uh, yeah, let's just join them.
[319:11.39]I don't know why I assumed that.
[319:17.79]Okay, there we go.
[319:24.65]Is this the?
[319:25.13]Aren't there like three?
[319:27.41]Are we at the right one for sure?
[319:29.64]I think so.
[319:30.02]Yeah, because it looks like the spawns right here.
[319:33.38]Yeah, we're looking for wait, maybe not.
[319:38.95]Oh, I guess.
[319:39.77]No, I guess he spawns right here.
[319:41.70]Because there's like three different pools with three different coal car.
[319:45.38]I don't remember what order it is.
[319:49.30]Oh, there's a booty chest.
[319:52.04]What?
[319:52.24]How have we not got one?
[320:31.46]Why don't you just write yep in party chat?
[320:33.44]Come on, somebody else give me a yep.
[320:34.68]Because we're just waiting.
[320:39.30]We gotta... We gotta do the king of the hill thing.
[320:43.51]Are we just a few BS over here?
[320:48.39]Yep.
[321:00.70]Yes.
[321:08.27]Oh my God.
[321:10.03]Um, the other two guys.
[321:11.79]Did they just leave?
[321:13.50]They're over there.
[321:15.50]Oh, he's not elite though.
[321:16.38]It's okay.
[321:17.48]It's fine.
[321:18.92]I'm just dying.
[321:19.52]They'll get credit for that.
[321:20.30]Yeah.
[321:24.04]He just ran so fast over.
[321:25.36]I gotta get rid of this bleach.
[321:35.30]Oh, you might need that for the dungeon.
[321:43.54]Drink that from mana.
[321:57.45]Still need a few more bracers and then we can turn it all in.
[322:12.26]do you remember the last movie we saw in theaters together was Star Wars the rise of Skywalker oh you mean the movie where they where they retconned the entire franchise and they had uh well actually I don't spoil the whole franchise
[322:37.84]Didn't we leave the theater and neither one of us wanted to say it sucked?
[322:40.98]Oh, yeah.
[322:42.22]I was like, I think I was afraid you might like it and you were afraid I might like it.
[322:46.50]So we were just kind of like.
[322:50.11]Yeah, that's always an awkward conversation in the car because just, hey, that was something, huh?
[322:57.09]Like, yeah, it was something.
[322:59.34]Something weird.
[323:01.48]And here's the best way to break the ice on that.
[323:04.08]You pick out a scene in the movie that no one would think was good.
[323:08.88]And just go, man, that part when, you know, when they, I mean, this is talking about the last movie, but like, yeah, remember that part where they went to the casino?
[323:15.52]And what the fuck was that about?
[323:17.29]I mean, that was kind of dumb.
[323:19.81]And then the other person than you would chime in.
[323:25.19]Say?
[323:25.45]I'd be like, oh yeah, the casino.
[323:30.97]They weren't even playing real poker in there.
[323:34.68]I can't believe everybody likes this game.
[323:36.54]I mean movie.
[323:37.70]Yeah, another thing.
[323:38.60]It was like the whole thing that he's supposed to be his son.
[323:41.72]Like, I don't know about that, man.
[323:44.26]You got to break the ice with a terrible scene and then see if the person that you are guessing if they liked it or not talks shit about the terrible scene.
[323:51.17]Because if they do, now you have an opening to say the movie was dog shit.
[323:55.88]Arto's like, what?
[323:58.76]What's wrong?
[324:06.38]I do actually remember the scene that I thought about that in the last movie, though.
[324:11.26]It was the one where they've got the relic, and they go to the random planet, and they happen to land in the correct spot that they have to stand to, like, hold the relic up, and it matches the landscape in the background.
[324:23.07]And they're like, yes, we're here.
[324:32.59]Or you could just say your real opinion like an adult.
[324:39.47]I don't know.
[324:40.29]I feel like if you're in the car with somebody, you're just like, hey, that movie sucked dick, didn't it?
[324:45.86]I feel like the other person's like, um, I liked it.
[324:49.42]Hey, oh, um, hey, uh, I'm just kidding.
[324:54.86]I, um, I'm sorry.
[324:56.10]I mean, I think you're a stupid idiot, but like, whatever.
[324:59.61]Let's go get fucking Burger King.
[325:16.04]We're never going to get all these bracers.
[325:17.14]I need you to go outside.
[325:22.20]Is this how I need to pee?
[325:23.12]Are you yelling at me because you need to pee?
[325:24.84]Is that what it is?
[325:31.24]Somebody says, is anybody else naked?
[325:32.60]Alright, you don't share that.
[325:37.73]Okay, let's go.
[325:40.77]Not enough mana.
[325:46.37]no mana is your uh dude still on defensive he is okay alright I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming make sure you get the bracers you share that all the time no I don't alright I gotta get to a safe spot
[326:12.78]Get to a safe spot.
[326:14.40]Wait, how many do I need?
[326:15.66]One more?
[326:15.98]Two more?
[326:17.00]We each need two more.
[326:18.49]Ooh.
[326:23.67]I am wearing those.
[326:25.31]Oh, you have those on?
[326:27.45]I think that's the ones I bought from Otto earlier.
[326:30.33]I think this is safe right here.
[326:41.10]Alright, he's gotta go up.
[326:42.78]I'll be right back.
[326:46.66]Chat, I'm dead.
[326:47.56]It's over.
[326:52.03]Not even five seconds.
[327:10.41]Okay, more for me.
[327:18.37]Three agility, two stamina.
[327:22.01]Oh, I'm set to level 30.
[327:34.20]Okay, we're just gonna have Jerma slash follow me while I go around and hit copper nodes for the rest of the stream.
[327:45.94]And then every time I do, you have to write plus one in the chat, indicating that my mining skill has increased.
[328:06.62]Okay, you're gonna have to follow a little faster before the level 16 hyenas catch up.
[328:20.84]If we get hit by a coal cart patrol... I'm ready to get down, Mr. President.
[328:57.20]Okay, if you go up to a cliff and someone's slash following you... If Jerma comes back and he's dead and I'm not, that's a bad look.
[329:13.41]That's true, yeah.
[329:18.59]I'll blame it on, like, chat stream sniping.
[329:25.50]Do you guys see all those coal car over there?
[329:41.09]Oh, my internet disconnected.
[329:46.08]Oh no, I'm stuck holding W. Alright, I'm half here.
[329:54.79]I'm half here.
[329:56.21]I'm ready to fight if you need me.
[329:57.93]Okay.
[330:01.11]I saw you aggro at the 16.
[330:02.15]I was like, he's dead if I don't run over there and start casting Shadow Bolts.
[330:06.99]No, he's like the second you left.
[330:10.14]You're like, alright, this looks like a safe spot.
[330:13.60]Oh shit, there's so much stuff everywhere.
[330:15.04]Alright, let's... They're all yellow.
[330:18.14]They're chilling.
[330:19.60]What level do I have to be for 10?
[330:45.62]I got a bag full of shit right now.
[330:47.80]Yeah, me too.
[330:48.68]Me too.
[330:50.06]Still, we got to get a couple more of those.
[330:52.82]I'm leaning in over to the computer.
[330:58.20]I still need two.
[331:00.72]We can get the bracers anywhere else.
[331:02.01]It's fine.
[331:03.47]I want to get to level 13 or 14.
[331:07.15]I mean, we could just get the bracers.
[331:08.85]I was just dicking around while you were gone.
[331:13.52]I only need to kill, like, one thing.
[331:15.32]So, what do you think?
[331:18.24]Do you think we can do, uh, Ragefire at 14?
[331:20.13]Is that a bad idea?
[331:23.83]It would be easier for you than for me.
[331:26.89]That's very true.
[331:27.71]Although, you... Are you tank spec right now?
[331:32.65]Uh, I don't think you're supposed to tank spec.
[331:38.27]Until, like, way later.
[331:41.73]Alright, give me give me one more minute.
[331:43.29]Be careful.
[331:47.34]I'm following Alex.
[331:52.36]Chat, we're the World of Warcraft experts.
[331:55.89]I'm just supposed to do five into cruelty and then arms and that should be good for dungeoning while leveling.
[332:01.01]Are you supposed to dungeon with like a two hander?
[332:14.64]The only reason I've got a one-hander and a shield is because they're both greens.
[332:19.10]And I need to go to, like, Thunder Bluff to get training and swords.
[332:33.14]Get down, Mr. President.
[332:41.22]Oh, under attack.
[332:46.86]I got it.
[332:47.66]Dude, Jerma, he probably hears me from the other side of his house.
[332:51.65]He's probably sprinting back to the computer right now.
[333:01.61]He's actually on slash follow.
[333:09.79]I think it's this grass right here.
[333:14.27]Yeah, he's got me on speakers.
[333:15.59]He can like he can hear me.
[333:17.21]So I can't say any weird shit to you.
[333:19.89]You know?
[333:21.55]It won't be our little secret.
[333:33.81]Alright.
[333:35.35]I am back.
[333:37.06]Welcome back.
[333:37.88]Need a couple more bracers.
[333:42.02]yeah I was just trying to watch out for these like the little Savannah lions they spawn in these grass areas I did hear you uh when I heard sprint I looked to see what danger was there and I saw it was a goofy troll and I said he's got it he's fine yeah he's like we got attacked by one Savannah prowler who tried to end the stream early
[334:13.19]I got down to one HP.
[334:17.58]Let's get these bracers and then I'm going to go probably like 14 and a half.
[334:43.71]Yay.
[334:47.38]I only need one more.
[334:49.60]And I got maxed improved shadow bolt.
[334:54.26]Excellent.
[334:55.84]Very cool.
[335:00.75]Yeah, well, you were gone.
[335:01.37]I just got really close to the microphone and just went.
[335:04.47]That's pretty cool.
[335:07.33]Did anybody say pog?
[335:13.39]they said uh they said plus one pretty sick only a plus one yeah that's what that's what happens when +2 is like a game of telephone across the internet now you know just comes comes back in a different way oh I can use that
[335:43.98]There's the plus one shadow damage.
[335:54.10]Oh, thank you.
[335:54.60]These two guys invented +2.
[336:12.06]That was from the stream that we did.
[336:16.50]Very, very long time ago.
[336:17.54]That is true.
[336:18.12]What was that?
[336:21.38]2016?
[336:21.40]2015?
[336:21.52]No, 2016?
[336:22.45]It was really early on.
[336:23.53]The dog days of Kane and Lynch 2.
[336:24.47]Yeah.
[336:53.45]I am done.
[336:55.53]Still need one.
[336:56.21]I mean, the +2 stream was definitely a plus five, but it's been like minus 10 since then, you know?
[337:13.26]I think that stream still holds up.
[337:15.00]I think it was... I would call that a certified classic.
[337:17.81]I just meant the decline of our mental health.
[337:22.07]Oh, I see what you mean.
[337:31.20]Only the true gamers know there were more numbers.
[337:39.10]It's funny because we talked about after that doing it for other games.
[337:43.12]But the uniqueness of Kane and Lynch was the game was kind of a piece of shit.
[337:48.12]And the whole game was like four hours long.
[337:51.64]Yes, it was a very short game.
[337:53.81]So we were looking for other games we could beat together in less than five hours or four hours.
[337:59.47]And that's kind of one of the only ones.
[338:02.47]Where's this dude going?
[338:05.19]Oh, we're done.
[338:05.65]You're done.
[338:06.05]You got it.
[338:06.58]Oh, yeah, we're done.
[338:07.22]What are we doing?
[338:08.34]Get out of here.
[338:11.61]They kind of stopped making that kind of co-op game, though.
[338:17.20]Yeah, the age of sit on the couch and play a game and beat the whole thing in six hours with a friend is... There were a lot of those that came out in the mid-2000s, late-2000s.
[338:38.35]A way out.
[338:39.54]Funny you say a way out, because the man in the call right now was, we did that too.
[338:44.04]I feel like I won more of the minigames, but I don't remember.
[338:53.09]I think you won them all.
[338:59.70]Yeah, girl, we won another one.
[339:05.49]I don't know.
[339:05.85]Maybe we can find a game that we can beat in one stream and... Go for it again.
[339:23.08]Fear 3 co-op you can beat in one night for sure.
[339:28.32]Oh, Fear 3?
[339:30.77]I played the first one.
[339:31.93]Did I play the... I think I played the first two.
[339:33.17]I don't remember doing the third one though.
[339:35.00]I just remember fear three sucked, but maybe that's like a good thing.
[339:39.44]Might be a good thing, yeah.
[339:46.29]Or as is better known for three or.
[339:51.25]Here three is terrible.
[339:52.67]People are saying.
[339:56.67]Is that the one with no fear?
[339:58.57]Two was the one with the girl.
[340:00.03]It was a horror game.
[340:05.91]The first one was awesome.
[340:07.35]I think I played all of them.
[340:09.39]Careful here.
[340:12.84]All I remember from the first one is, oh shit.
[340:18.22]Oh shit.
[340:35.91]It was never not funny.
[340:36.85]It was always just funny.
[340:44.94]Have I done PvP yet?
[340:47.58]Well, I killed that ERP person yesterday.
[340:50.60]I don't know if that counts.
[341:21.39]How many?
[341:21.63]We got five or six quests to turn in, don't we?
[341:24.65]Oh shit, this is going to be juicy.
[341:28.19]This is going to be juicy.
[341:29.71]This is going to be awesome.
[341:30.93]Oh yeah, look at all the complete.
[341:34.51]We can take all these.
[341:35.19]Knock me on my ass.
[341:40.16]Twice.
[341:57.54]Cool.
[342:01.96]Can you guys beat this in four hours?
[342:08.64]Ragefire takes about an hour, doesn't it?
[342:10.16]Uh, yeah.
[342:12.67]30 minutes?
[342:15.33]Especially if you're like, I've never tanked it before, so I can't, I don't think I can go as fast as the tank who originally was tanking for me.
[342:26.63]Oh, oh.
[342:27.76]I don't know where I'm going.
[342:29.18]You can lead that.
[342:30.28]You can go as slow as you want.
[342:31.60]That's some good money.
[342:36.93]That's a decent axe for me.
[342:38.99]Okay, so...
[342:57.80]Back to the crossroads.
[343:02.27]Playing hardcore?
[343:03.39]Playing hardcore.
[343:06.41]Trip to Org?
[343:09.01]Yeah, we need to learn some new abilities too.
[343:24.78]Use Imp.
[343:28.38]The second that I turn to imp, I want to, and I plan on having the imp be the... I want to be fire.
[343:42.59]But for now, in the dangerous, dangerous place that is the Barrens, it's going to be Voidwalker.
[344:03.96]You should play Dark and Darker.
[344:04.98]I think I'm the only person that I know that likes that game.
[344:10.53]With maybe one or two exceptions.
[344:12.35]I was with you for one of the streams, but you had already been playing.
[344:15.45]Like, you and Poke had already been playing for a while.
[344:18.69]And I didn't know what was happening.
[344:21.07]And I think I was just holding both of you back.
[344:23.35]Because I was just like, I don't know when anything does.
[344:28.00]How do you swing your weapon now?
[344:31.03]Oh yeah, you, I did, didn't I just say, hey, download this game.
[344:34.57]It's fun.
[344:35.03]And I was like already streaming.
[344:37.17]I love this game.
[344:38.05]Like you should, you should play it.
[344:39.27]I was like, okay.
[344:43.22]It was fun.
[344:43.78]They changed it a lot though.
[344:45.22]It went through a ton of massive changes.
[344:48.78]It's no longer a BR.
[344:50.70]Well, I mean it is, but there's no circle anymore.
[344:54.94]What do you need?
[344:57.89]Roll with honor.
[344:59.61]Strength.
[345:04.26]They did that a while ago, too.
[345:05.42]It's been like that for months and months.
[345:08.46]It was like, what, like six months a year?
[345:16.71]We'll hit 15.
[345:23.07]Well, look, we just got so much experience.
[345:25.03]We're already halfway there.
[345:28.46]Have we got a bunch of shit over there in Ratchet?
[345:29.92]Yeah, alright.
[345:30.36]Alright, quick trip to... Do you want to do a trip to Thunder Bluff?
[345:36.10]And then... Oh, wait, you don't have the Org flight path.
[345:38.76]Oh, fuck.
[345:40.85]Oh, no.
[345:41.57]I got to walk to Thunder Bluff, dude.
[345:43.17]Just go on without me.
[345:44.71]Well, you're going to have to walk to Org and Thunder Bluff.
[345:50.97]no I gotta do them both so what's closer probably because because the turn-ins for rfc are in thunder bluff and we've got a quest that we can take to run to thunder bluff within 45 minutes it doesn't take even like 10 but they give you a long time oh okay so what maybe let's just go back
[346:20.12]Just hearthstone, you know, that's a great idea.
[346:23.98]If I didn't make it the crossroads, just absentmindedly, I did it.
[346:27.58]Okay, it's going to sound stupid, but you have clicked on the wind rider here, right?
[346:39.16]Oh yeah, there's just nowhere to go.
[346:40.26]Okay.
[346:40.92]I'm just making sure that you don't run all the way there and can't fly back.
[346:46.08]That would be very funny.
[346:47.46]So-so.
[346:49.28]Alright, I'm gonna go to... I'll go to Orgrimmar.
[346:51.30]What a disaster.
[347:02.75]A mage could port you there too.
[347:03.95]I don't know if there's any mages in the crossroads that want to send my ass to Orgrimmar.
[347:21.37]Or Thunder Bluff.
[347:22.57]10 gold.
[347:33.00]I have 73 silver.
[347:34.82]Is that enough?
[347:43.26]Bearing you.
[348:03.33]1.5 million for a... Are you going to come all the way back?
[348:06.80]Yeah, I was going to say, get out of here.
[348:10.76]That's a gigantic aggro range.
[348:12.44]It's funny how often you see this happen now.
[348:31.86]it's about early on you this was happening very rarely I remember watching people's streams and jumping around to the only fangs streamers that happens all the time now people are hitting 60. yeah I can turn those alerts off it's oh it's kind of nice sometimes it doesn't happen that often and then dying in brd yeah
[349:05.94]Blackrock Depths.
[349:15.23]Cheers to that.
[349:17.81]Cheers to you.
[349:31.82]Somebody said, I love hearing about hemorrhoids hitting 60.
[349:35.64]Does somebody have a name like that?
[349:37.16]Hey, at least we get to sightsee a little longer, right?
[350:05.49]I got mail from Bugleberry.
[350:06.86]Hey, so when's the PUBG co-op streams coming back?
[350:25.31]One and a half million dollars.
[350:36.19]I'll just add it to the deck.
[350:49.16]This person's doing something weird, hold on.
[351:01.89]Who gave the tauren... cocaine?
[351:08.34]he's been crushing up fucking peace bloom and sniffing it hey so I'm already here in org I'm looking for you but I can't find you I'll be there in a minute
[351:40.89]I have to be complaining to everybody.
[351:57.89]I'm realizing... I was like, why am I squinting?
[352:00.73]Oh, right.
[352:02.09]Must have gone into Durotar.
[352:09.95]Would you enjoy the game better without the glow?
[352:12.17]Because you can turn it off.
[352:14.45]No, it's just Durotar.
[352:15.54]That's just crazy.
[352:20.40]It's covered in Cheeto dust.
[353:17.71]20 grams of protein, not 20 gold.
[353:19.73]You guys are more wow-pilled than I am.
[353:50.26]20 gold question if you take engineering and mining how are you supposed to make bars you gotta smelt them you can smell mining okay I didn't know if mining could smelt or if blacksmithing yeah mining smells the bars engineering and blacksmithing both use the bars
[354:42.12]Shit, I couldn't come up with anything fast enough.
[354:45.52]The worst part about having slow hands and a 5,000 mile per hour brain is my brain is trying to communicate to my hands to write something, but I just can't do it fast enough.
[355:08.23]Are you a typer that rests your fingers on the buttons that have the little raised bump or are you like a chaos typer?
[355:15.16]Chaos.
[355:16.52]Yeah, me too.
[355:17.52]Total chaos.
[355:18.20]I have to look down and half the time I don't even know what I'm typing.
[355:30.86]Left hand is on the bump, but the right hand is chaos.
[355:33.54]Interesting.
[355:38.95]So you go kind of half, halfway.
[355:40.81]I'm seeing a lot of same, true, true, really?
[355:50.07]So one hand is the control and one hand is chaos.
[355:58.23]Anybody do right hand control, left hand chaos?
[356:13.86]Home roam.
[356:17.62]The problem with the home row for me is my brain and fingers still cannot process how far away I have A, S, D, F, J, K, L, Semi, right?
[356:29.88]I still, without looking, the muscle memory of taking where my middle finger on D up to E is, it's not there.
[356:43.83]The muscle memory is not there.
[356:48.07]And I've tried to learn it, and it's just... I can't.
[356:50.83]I cannot put it into long term.
[356:53.57]That distance of whatever it is just can't be computerized in my brain.
[357:12.25]Why is your middle finger on D?
[357:15.23]ASDF.
[357:17.86]And then your thumb is the spacebar.
[357:19.32]That's that's the home row.
[357:21.52]JKL semi.
[357:25.76]JKL semi sounds like.
[357:29.38]I never heard about it like that.
[357:31.86]I guess that is where the right hand is supposed to go, but that was before like we did mouse for everything.
[357:36.14]It sounds like an actor name too.
[357:38.60]That's what I was thinking and introducing JKL semi.
[357:42.67]In the role as Batman or whatever.
[357:51.41]JKL Simmons.
[357:53.86]Are people with four names just better than everyone else?
[357:58.10]JKL Simmons.
[357:59.60]That's a, you know what?
[358:00.89]That's a great kind of fun parody name.
[358:05.25]I'm surprised you don't see that more often.
[358:32.91]That sounds like a drag name.
[358:35.81]That's funny, yeah.
[358:37.24]JKL Semi.
[358:38.52]Where are you going?
[358:48.83]You going in the dungeon right now?
[358:50.99]No, this is where the wall trainer is.
[358:58.49]Oh, fuck.
[358:59.05]Wrong way.
[359:02.90]When your character dies, would you please do a YouTube react face?
[359:09.20]Don't worry.
[359:09.54]Whenever I'm in real danger, I'll make sure the webcam is on so you get your clip.
[359:17.79]And then you can take that clip and you can shove it up your ass because I'm going to come back stronger.
[359:23.91]Oh, this is a lot of new stuff.
[359:39.43]That is now worth doing.
[359:41.01]90 shadow damage versus... Okay, so two shadow bolts would be one corruption at that point.
[359:51.13]And it's about six seconds to cast that.
[359:53.23]55 mana versus 70.
[359:56.92]I mean, it's worth doing it now.
[359:59.82]At least for a while.
[360:02.20]Finally got drain life.
[360:15.44]Curse of Recklessness.
[360:17.56]Oh yeah, this is... You make the enemy stronger, but you take a bunch of their armor away.
[360:30.11]Is this only useful on casters?
[360:31.61]Would you just put this on a caster?
[360:35.35]Factor in kill time, and you can start wanding instead of casting.
[360:41.92]That's true.
[360:44.18]So I'm going to probably start to use corruption now.
[361:01.43]What was the third thing I just got?
[361:02.94]Corruption to... I guess I can look right here.
[361:07.90]Recklessness.
[361:09.66]Oh, life drain.
[361:10.28]That's what it was.
[361:14.67]Put that on middle mouse.
[361:15.39]I feel like it's useful here.
[361:20.72]Alright, now get the flight path.
[361:34.69]I don't have an MMO mouse.
[361:35.89]I'm sorry.
[361:37.73]I have the same razor death Adder I've had.
[361:41.13]Since I was 19.
[361:44.97]I made that up too.
[361:46.57]Got you.
[361:57.82]I have had this for a very long time though.
[361:59.30]I've bought two or three of these over the years.
[362:00.88]It's been at least probably four or five years since I've gotten them in my mouth.
[362:09.16]Who teaches two-handed swords?
[362:14.37]Oh, hold on.
[362:14.71]I got to do some of this.
[362:26.88]Where's the tailor?
[362:27.94]Down there.
[362:42.62]I used an $8 mouse off of Amazon.
[362:44.38]There's nothing wrong with that.
[362:48.71]Some of that Amazon basic stuff works and just lasts.
[362:52.93]Just cheap.
[362:54.07]Sometimes you just don't need anything more than that.
[362:58.53]What level?
[362:58.95]We are halfway to 15.
[363:03.45]Goal tonight is to get to 15 and then shit our pants in Ragefire Chasm.
[363:12.35]And that would probably be it.
[363:23.40]Oh, the armors are so much more... What?
[363:30.10]It's a green Speedo?
[363:31.96]I look like a weirdo.
[363:37.89]Green Speedo with a tuxedo on.
[363:43.87]A bar of chocolate for a weapon.
[363:50.93]Oh my god, man.
[363:52.37]Okay, whatever.
[364:01.06]Eh.
[364:02.94]Wait.
[364:04.84]What if I sell it?
[364:06.92]But wait.
[364:10.71]If I do make a priest ticket, just give that to him.
[364:21.35]I could sell that too.
[364:31.85]I don't know.
[364:32.53]Three stamina.
[364:34.07]30 health or one point of shadow damage.
[364:36.53]I don't think that's worth it.
[364:38.65]I'll just... Who wants this?
[364:47.56]I don't think anybody's going to buy that.
[364:55.86]I just realized Jermra is Mr. Rogers, but if he had a Twitch stream and a fat ass.
[365:01.70]Didn't I just tell somebody to shove something up your ass?
[365:05.10]I just told you guys to like fuck off.
[365:09.35]I don't think I don't think that would have been spoken.
[365:21.59]That's a good disenchant item.
[365:24.19]There I don't have a lot of these disenchant items.
[365:26.35]Maybe I should just do disenchanting and just lie to people and say I don't have it.
[365:31.80]Aren't you an enchanter?
[365:33.48]No, I got tailoring and skinning.
[365:46.75]Could just make money on it too.
[365:51.33]Although, I definitely don't want to use the auction house.
[365:54.43]Because I know that is a no-no.
[365:57.19]I know that for a fact.
[365:59.03]So, I'm just going to... Maybe I'll hold on to one of these.
[366:02.04]Because if I ever make a character, I'd want to use it.
[366:12.20]But I have to get rid of all this stuff.
[366:14.03]Let me go to the tailor.
[366:14.91]The actual tailor.
[366:17.33]Where are you?
[366:18.75]Hello.
[366:25.75]boots be safe okay it is one bolt of linen cloth and one thread I'm just I just want to get the skill up so Red Dead Redemption was the angriest I've been on stream
[366:59.30]I don't know.
[366:59.74]Hit and run.
[367:09.94]I don't think I was as angry on the hit and run stream as I was just shocked.
[367:17.85]That was a shocking game.
[367:18.87]It was probably the two towers of Malenia.
[367:24.09]Malenia sounds correct to me.
[367:30.60]My head was going to pop like a pimple during that Millenia fight.
[367:42.14]You turned purple while you were fighting.
[367:43.72]Yeah, that was probably bad for me.
[367:51.44]Is this game just hitting shit and stuff?
[367:59.24]The surge was so bad that I remember you were angry off stream.
[368:02.68]Yeah.
[368:05.32]Yeah, the surge was another bad one for me.
[368:06.96]I think that I just got me on a bad day.
[368:10.70]Honestly, I just have that.
[368:12.12]It was a bad day.
[368:14.11]Just something.
[368:15.59]Thumped up my ass that day.
[368:16.77]I was just kind of annoyed.
[368:27.55]I can't carry anymore.
[368:34.63]This thing is still orange.
[368:39.50]Oh, for those who don't know, orange means it's a guaranteed skill point.
[368:43.06]Yellow means, I believe, 70% chance for a point.
[368:46.66]And green is 25, 30% chance for a point.
[368:51.40]So I learned recently that those are all just averages.
[368:56.30]Oh.
[368:58.06]And so I think the lower it is on the list, the lower the chance it ranks you up.
[369:05.94]Hmm.
[369:09.14]So like the, uh, the yellows are not all 70%.
[369:13.10]Interesting.
[369:18.21]Is somebody giving me technical advice on how to get The Simpsons hit and run to run better?
[369:31.20]What is that?
[369:31.76]That's cause it wasn't in RAM.
[369:38.43]Yeah, I don't think I'm going to open that one again.
[369:40.67]I'm not sure.
[369:41.33]We're not going back to that one.
[370:00.32]I need to speed run it.
[370:04.33]I remember at one point, didn't... There was somebody that... I raided somebody a while ago that was speedrunning it.
[370:13.80]People run that game, I think, still to this day.
[370:30.25]Alright.
[370:31.17]50 tailoring.
[370:31.85]Just like that.
[370:32.59]Look at how many points I got.
[370:36.50]I'm going to lose all my money.
[370:42.59]Nice.
[370:44.05]Actually, I want to make these right now.
[370:49.37]There we go.
[370:55.45]Bag time.
[370:56.01]Let's go.
[370:56.44]I need one more.
[370:57.10]Shit, I have no cloth left.
[371:16.28]What is this for?
[371:19.34]I walk by the donation of wool, the donation of silk, those quests.
[371:22.83]What do they even do?
[371:23.89]Rep.
[371:24.83]It's just rep?
[371:28.05]Yeah.
[371:29.29]So if you really, really want the wolf or ogre mar, just bring a shitload of wool here.
[371:39.54]Is it repeatable?
[371:41.18]Can you only do it once?
[371:45.12]What are you looking for?
[371:46.62]60 wool is a lot though.
[371:57.78]Go forth to victory.
[372:10.02]I think I gotta keep the tuxedo on.
[372:19.85]You look like a stripper.
[372:25.27]You kind of look like you just popped out of a cake.
[372:27.08]Yeah, I don't.
[372:39.71]This is kind of riding up on me.
[372:50.48]Alright, let's get to 15.
[372:51.46]I'm going to bank a bunch of this stuff because I want to look at it later.
[372:58.65]If I actually do enchanting, that's a lot to disenchant.
[373:03.97]Yeah, I was just chilling, grinding over 50 copper bars.
[373:09.69]Now that I figured out I don't have to be blacksmithing to do it.
[373:17.81]Head to the bank.
[373:33.37]Tidy whities.
[373:34.25]Do you think it's unreasonable if you're in the Valley of Honor to use your hearth to get back to the inn of Org?
[373:50.78]No.
[373:51.34]To me, hearthstone is a convenience thing.
[373:53.72]It's not necessarily a travel thing.
[373:57.88]Use your hearthstone even if you're 100 feet away.
[373:59.75]If it gives you convenience factor, use it.
[374:31.99]I still can't believe that Blizzard added this novelty item named after the card game like was it really that popular?
[374:39.61]which one?
[374:43.61]oh I'm just being a jackass well I guess I'm male uh that's not the real Bugleberry
[375:06.38]Oh wait, this is the guy that gave me the fish before.
[375:08.32]Well, I bought it.
[375:10.30]Thank you for your business in abandoned mine in dead man land.
[375:13.64]You take extra fish.
[375:14.56]Yes.
[375:15.02]New product sample.
[375:16.82]Marinate in blue juice.
[375:18.41]I give to you.
[375:19.27]Very good family recipe.
[375:21.33]Fish approved.
[375:22.29]Fish wish you good bones and long life.
[375:29.47]I'm taking this.
[375:30.31]I like that one.
[375:36.47]Who is just sending me fishes?
[375:38.19]You're sending me a single one.
[375:40.13]I need to know message.
[375:46.41]Rare fish.
[376:04.70]How do I return it?
[376:37.38]You know what?
[376:38.36]I don't give a fuck.
[376:39.18]I'ma do it.
[376:49.32]Oh, I didn't take the fish.
[376:51.32]Oh, no, no, this is a good one.
[377:00.70]What can I give?
[377:01.78]I gotta get a birthday.
[377:02.48]I've given a birthday present.
[377:05.02]Hold up, they make edible fish now?
[377:14.94]Really send them these items.
[377:16.30]Yeah, whatever, I don't care.
[377:35.98]Oh, let me see.
[377:37.00]Hey, I just wanted to say that you have some pretty loud WoW lore opinions for someone who doesn't understand about half of it.
[377:43.72]I highly recommend Platinum WoW on YouTube.
[377:47.10]Thanks for motivating me to try out hardcore WoW.
[377:49.30]Even classic as a grind fest, have some money.
[377:55.90]Is this your YouTube channel?
[378:09.05]Guys, you don't understand.
[378:10.11]Arthas was good, actually.
[378:16.72]No, that's a real... That's an actual channel.
[378:19.56]Well, yeah, okay.
[378:22.66]Maybe I'll learn something.
[378:36.02]Cool.
[378:36.34]Okay.
[378:37.04]I think I'm good to fly back.
[378:44.80]Would you rather be bald or a foot shorter?
[378:47.79]Um... Bald, bald, bald, bald, bald.
[378:50.67]Give me a bright red pen so I can write bald a thousand times on the assignment.
[379:00.77]Going from 5-7 to 4-7.
[379:03.11]If you were like 6-2, that's fine.
[379:05.64]You could go from 6-2 down to, you know, 5-8, 5-9, whatever.
[379:08.54]It doesn't matter.
[379:11.58]I would lose too much.
[379:14.74]What about you?
[379:15.14]I mean, you can wear a hat in public.
[379:19.95]You can't walk around on stilts, you know?
[379:23.77]That's true.
[379:47.62]Yeah, you'd be 5'2 if you were 6'2.
[379:51.37]Who cares if you're bald?
[379:52.67]That doesn't matter.
[379:53.33]Who cares if you're 5'2 either?
[379:56.81]Who gives a shit?
[379:57.47]Apparently, according to all these fucking goofballs here,
[380:22.19]Wait, did you already take the flight path?
[380:25.15]Yeah, I flew back.
[380:26.27]Oh.
[380:29.17]I didn't want to forget.
[380:29.91]Oh, I'm doing the thing where you stretch and every single muscle squeezes and you make a loud sound.
[380:42.99]Yeah, you have to scream to let it out.
[380:50.78]You have to go like...
[380:54.21]Yeah, you only get a good stretch if while you're doing it you go... Your vocal cords have to stretch too.
[381:15.59]Double your finger size or triple your forehead size does not increase brain capacity.
[381:24.22]Uh, definitely the fingers.
[381:25.34]I already took the forehead one, so too late for me.
[381:34.38]I would definitely take fingers.
[381:35.40]Yeah, fingers.
[381:37.62]You would look like, um.
[381:40.12]What's the the little dweeb from Super Jail?
[381:43.42]What's his name?
[381:43.86]The guy that talks like this and he's like, oh my God, he's the wardens.
[381:49.14]What's his name?
[381:51.64]What what what from what property?
[381:53.60]From Super Jill.
[381:54.92]Jared from Super Jill.
[382:01.72]I have never seen Super Jill.
[382:04.65]Really?
[382:04.93]Not one episode?
[382:06.53]Was that on Adult Swim?
[382:12.11]Long time ago.
[382:16.33]It was crazy.
[382:17.01]It was one of those shows where...
[382:20.44]The.
[382:22.08]There was always just some wild, crazy, brutal animations of just people getting like putting meat grinders and.
[382:31.14]It was a crazy show.
[382:43.32]Ah, this is the one to walk to Thunder Bluff.
[382:45.12]I'm not.
[382:45.68]We're not doing that one right now.
[382:50.98]Should we had to ratchet?
[382:54.02]Oh yeah, I mean we can either walk to Thunder Bluff or we can walk to ratchet.
[382:57.49]Those are yeah, those are the choices.
[382:59.49]I think walk to ratchet is better than walk to Thunder Bluff.
[383:05.87]And the flight path there too.
[383:08.57]And a bank.
[383:25.53]I just thought the warden's voice actor in Super Jail was really good.
[383:28.57]Really funny.
[383:32.19]That very whimsical, sing-songy way of talking.
[383:41.40]Okay, I'm finally catching up to your character.
[383:43.34]You really do look like a man in his mid-50s getting ready to go for a swim.
[383:51.58]Like Daniel Craig.
[383:57.94]Like, I just see the legs from here.
[383:59.86]That's the only thing I see.
[384:00.68]Yeah, they are beaming.
[384:03.18]Oh, that is reflecting the sun for sure.
[384:05.92]I'll turn that off now.
[384:21.39]Is that an interface or social?
[384:24.47]The 60 shout out thing?
[384:28.84]I didn't know you could turn it off.
[384:34.91]Where is it?
[384:46.10]Yeah, it's an add-on.
[384:47.04]Is it an add-on?
[384:56.33]It's called announcement.
[384:58.60]It is not an add-on.
[385:05.38]Oh, there it is.
[385:05.96]Hardcore death announcements.
[385:12.63]Guild deaths.
[385:16.17]All deaths, really?
[385:21.93]Is that where that death add-on gets all the info from?
[385:27.65]I think the death add-on, you actually, it's only people who also have the add-on, but I could be wrong.
[385:36.09]Yeah, you can show, you can do all deaths apparently.
[385:38.14]How many level one or twos would just be dying?
[385:40.66]Actually, I want to turn it on for a second.
[385:41.80]I'm curious.
[385:48.22]Hardcore death announcements.
[385:49.74]All deaths.
[385:54.16]A thousand people just went into the character creator.
[386:02.98]I wonder where it puts it.
[386:18.31]You have to join a chat channel.
[386:20.01]OK, yeah, whatever I don't join the channel.
[386:30.05]thousand people just logged out for no reason to log into the character creator I would get the all the other add-ons these first couple streams were putting the uh you know dipping the toes in the water a little the death log's fun like being able to see people's last words when they die is hilarious that's so fun yeah
[387:06.07]You're going to try to hit 60.
[387:07.15]The goal, let's just put the goal to get through whaling caverns.
[387:14.34]And we'll move the goalposts every time.
[387:34.37]This thing really is so good.
[387:36.23]Makes life tapping so much easier.
[387:48.22]Shitload of things here.
[387:49.92]Yeah, I only have room for like five more quests.
[387:55.44]Ratchet horns.
[387:58.28]Think some of these are a little too high.
[388:00.02]Some of these are 18 to 20.
[388:15.70]You're going to play this for seven hours every day?
[388:17.70]No.
[388:18.54]More like 10 hours every day.
[388:21.09]Right.
[388:43.83]OK, now I actually have a little triangle here where I can fly around.
[388:54.35]I went ahead and picked up the semiflange from the dude right here.
[389:00.80]Because I think it's level 16.
[389:01.90]Level 14.
[389:06.32]So we could probably do a few of these.
[389:10.06]Get to level 15 and then just send it and try to get through Ragefire.
[389:14.72]Yep.
[389:40.48]Where's this guy?
[389:41.06]Oh, over here.
[389:45.14]Time is money, friend.
[389:46.05]Trouble at the dock.
[389:48.63]Hurry back.
[389:50.87]That's a whaling cavern's quest.
[389:54.76]Time is money, friend.
[389:57.22]Be good.
[390:10.64]Oh, here's engineering.
[390:19.25]Is it weird to think that classic engineering was probably the coolest of all the professions?
[390:26.29]It kind of is.
[390:26.71]I feel like it had the most variety of interesting things to do.
[390:35.81]I kind of want to get up and stretch a little.
[390:38.17]Getting a little tight.
[390:42.76]What do I have to do here?
[390:44.14]Do I have to interact with something here?
[390:54.11]Oh, no.
[390:54.55]Okay, that's... Alright, I saw the cogwheel.
[390:59.65]I have all these checked.
[391:04.01]Cogwheel to me is interact with that.
[391:16.75]going to stream for much longer.
[391:20.94]I'm just being a chat Andy.
[391:24.48]Do they have a blacksmith hammer here?
[391:27.30]Let's see.
[391:34.03]I don't see a blacksmith here.
[391:35.89]I do not.
[391:45.10]Because a lot of the... Oh, wait.
[391:47.62]I guess you have to buy that.
[391:49.70]Sorry, I've never even done engineering or anything except for herbalism and alchemy, so I don't know anything about the rest of the professions.
[391:58.19]Yeah, the bar is eventually... You have to get stuff transmuted, I think.
[392:03.39]You need an alchemist to transmute gold or iron into gold.
[392:07.65]There's a whole weird system, I think.
[392:15.92]Or not, not gold.
[392:16.78]What is it?
[392:17.20]There's a certain bar that you need an alchemist to transmute.
[392:22.34]And they can only do it once a day.
[392:25.14]True silver.
[392:25.82]Or arcanite or true silver?
[392:26.78]Yeah, I think it's true silver.
[392:27.62]Alright, I'll be right back.
[392:33.58]I'm going to move around a little.
[392:38.97]Back in three or four minutes.
[392:44.94]Show ads.
[392:54.93]This should take me to through when we do railing caverns, I imagine.
[393:02.46]So this might be the last break.
[393:05.22]Unless this takes us more than an hour, which I don't think it will.
[393:07.00]I'll be right back.
[397:08.56]I'm going to make another tea.
[397:12.56]I feel like I'm drinking a lot of tea, but it has been like six and a half hours.
[397:16.57]I keep forgetting it's been that long.
[397:20.93]Maybe two minutes.
[397:36.54]Boom.
[397:43.67]Gotcha.
[398:24.02]Chad, I have a question for you.
[398:24.96]If you go to a restaurant, will you drink water that comes out of the, like, restaurant tap?
[399:03.70]I feel like after watching Kitchen Nightmares for like every season it temporarily ruined my ability to like enjoy eating at restaurants and then eventually you just have to like stuff that shit into like a locker somewhere and just pretend like you've never seen it so that you can continue to enjoy life
[399:57.54]It's fucking raw.
[400:02.67]What happened?
[400:04.65]Alright, we're back.
[400:10.23]Alright, let's jam out.
[400:11.43]Let's jam out to 15.
[400:16.78]Let's totally jam out to 15.
[400:20.82]We're halfway there.
[400:23.96]We'll be there in 10 minutes.
[400:30.05]Get the wanted poster if you didn't.
[400:32.04]Put on some drum and bass.
[400:36.36]Barren Longshore.
[400:37.52]Oh, that's right.
[400:41.24]All the people down there.
[400:44.71]How many Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas have you eaten at?
[400:51.63]I don't know.
[400:52.23]One?
[400:52.39]I think Gordon Ramsay steak is really the only one.
[400:59.46]I don't think I've been to the other ones.
[401:03.49]Gordon Ramsay steak was good though.
[401:04.73]That was a good food.
[401:08.55]It was good, but I think it was better pre-COVID, but I feel like we could say that about a lot of things.
[401:14.41]It's true.
[401:20.77]Yeah, that is fair.
[401:23.71]That was probably 2019.
[401:24.51]It's been five years.
[401:32.79]Alright, I think we can just hug the coast and do all the.
[401:37.13]South Sea freebooter stuff.
[401:45.62]Can we?
[401:49.40]You gotta go up and then.
[401:55.55]What's that Sir?
[401:56.13]Are you trying to like climb the hill?
[402:00.00]I was thinking about it, but I don't.
[402:01.88]Can you get over there from there?
[402:04.50]I don't think so.
[402:05.38]You can swim though.
[402:08.62]Oh, wait a minute.
[402:10.88]I think you can get over here.
[402:21.04]This way, right?
[402:26.97]Yeah, we can get there over here.
[402:30.11]Yeah, and I just meant like you couldn't climb the hill from without going around.
[402:33.39]Alright.
[402:40.85]I'm just asking if anyone's ever had moxie.
[402:42.84]I've had it before.
[402:46.96]What is that like a Borderlands themed drink?
[402:50.04]it tastes so bad but in a very good way it's what like a video game drink would that's what the way it would taste it could be like the world's most disgusting beverage but there's something about it it's you know the way that root beer feels when you drink it it kind of has that bite
[403:17.59]sure imagine if the entire soda was bite and nothing else so it's kind of like the fizzy waters yeah it's just bite bite bite it's just sweet but painful so like it's it's all kind of like bite but no substance so it is kind of like a borderland strength like a Borderlands game or a borderland stream
[403:47.93]Are you excited for Borderlands 4?
[403:49.29]Be honest.
[403:49.85]Say yes or no.
[403:51.01]No.
[403:51.95]Me either.
[404:06.70]But you better believe.
[404:08.68]Nothing.
[404:09.08]I got nothing to add to that either.
[404:10.74]There.
[404:10.94]You better believe.
[404:11.94]I can't wait to hit that.
[404:13.90]It ain't no rest for the wicked.
[404:18.29]Money don't grow on trees.
[404:21.38]I can sing it.
[404:24.28]I got bills to pay.
[404:27.66]Dude, I used to be obsessed with that band back in college, dude.
[404:33.80]It's a good song.
[404:34.56]It's a good song, but it's overplayed.
[404:36.41]It's been kind of tied.
[404:37.93]It's synonymous with Borderlands now.
[404:42.65]How was the movie?
[404:43.63]Was the movie...
[404:45.95]Worth watching like over somebody else's shoulder on a CRT.
[404:49.58]You already know the answer to that question.
[404:52.18]Yeah, but I just I want to hear people say it was bad.
[404:54.92]You know what I mean?
[404:55.34]I want to hear that it was bad.
[404:56.64]I want people to say it was bad so I can be like, yeah.
[405:02.56]Of course, I know the answer.
[405:03.65]I just want to see it.
[405:11.41]You can probably just farm this spot, honestly.
[405:16.50]Did you ever see the Warcraft movie?
[405:19.39]I did.
[405:23.03]For some reason, I own it on 4K and I've never seen it.
[405:25.91]I think it was a gift.
[405:27.65]Wait, you own it?
[405:28.53]You own like the Blu-ray, but you've never seen the movie?
[405:30.97]I've never seen it.
[405:42.81]I don't even remember if I liked it.
[405:45.44]I heard that it was like better than its reputation.
[405:47.83]I remember Gul'dan was kind of cool.
[406:02.80]But Gul'dan just is cool.
[406:04.53]And I'm not just saying that because I'm a warlock.
[406:17.97]Oh, cool, Dan.
[406:18.67]It's kind of an ugly hole here, but... Oh, whatever.
[406:32.57]I don't really want to send the Voidwalker up there.
[406:37.51]But... It's fair, but we're going to have to kill this dude.
[406:40.75]You know what?
[406:41.95]Let's go.
[406:42.53]O7's in the chat.
[406:44.02]Let's see.
[406:49.31]No rest for the wicked.
[406:53.35]I got bills to pay.
[406:54.95]I got lives to live.
[406:57.15]Ain't nothing in this world for free.
[406:59.66]Yeah, okay.
[407:00.48]There were different verses, you're right.
[407:04.94]They used to play that at like the grocery store.
[407:06.84]Really?
[407:11.16]Yeah, I remember like shopping for groceries in the late 2000s and it was just, it was like on the PA.
[407:17.20]Sounds like a pretty sick grocery store.
[407:18.76]That sounds awesome.
[407:32.53]Why did I put two conjured water in the bank?
[407:37.17]I'm getting a flashback of doing that.
[407:44.85]You might need two stacks of them.
[407:45.97]You don't know.
[407:48.48]was just on autopilot I put it in the bank I remember seeing the two go into the bank and did I think it was a I don't know maybe I thought it was a like a profession or something I don't know
[408:21.96]Well, get up there.
[408:22.48]What's he doing?
[408:34.93]Goblin cleanup is coming out.
[408:36.73]It would be good.
[408:39.53]Goblin cleanup?
[408:40.99]Like viscera cleanup detail?
[408:47.84]Didn't we play that one time?
[408:51.29]I remember playing that with Ster and he was unbearable.
[408:55.03]I thought, was I there?
[408:57.95]Cause I feel like I was there.
[409:00.81]You were definitely there on a half a dozen of these occasions for sure.
[409:03.95]He hated the game.
[409:06.17]He just was like, I want to leave because I don't want to play this.
[409:08.13]This is not fun.
[409:09.47]And he just was deliberately ruining things.
[409:11.53]He was dumping trash everywhere and spilling buckets on purpose.
[409:15.83]And he's like, I'm done.
[409:16.91]This game's boring.
[409:20.43]He hated that fucking game.
[409:27.54]Like, I feel like it was my idea and we forced him to play it, but I could be misremembering.
[409:33.58]That kind of happens pretty frequently, I think.
[409:36.38]It's just, hey, Ster, like, come on.
[409:38.04]We got to do this.
[409:38.79]It's going to be fun.
[409:40.35]Fine.
[409:41.09]And then he would come in.
[409:41.75]And to be fair, Ster makes it better.
[409:45.73]He does.
[409:46.25]He's a very funny, very funny young man.
[409:48.19]He makes a lot of great moments.
[409:57.08]But yeah, there were at least a dozen occasions that he was... Essentially, he crawled out of bed to do things that we asked him.
[410:04.60]Hey, you want to play this with us?
[410:09.80]Oh, that's pretty good.
[410:14.62]I feel like that was kind of the way it was, though.
[410:16.52]Especially back in the day.
[410:17.38]It's like, hey, I got a video I want to do.
[410:20.74]You in?
[410:21.02]And it's like, yeah, sure.
[410:23.42]Why not?
[410:23.78]Let's do it.
[410:45.89]Do we need the Baron?
[410:48.18]Yeah, we do.
[411:01.79]I can't fucking type.
[411:02.83]I can't RP.
[411:03.61]It sucks.
[411:10.30]but that was not even a good story because I had to do it fast oh we should invite this person we're about to go kill it without him oh there he is there oh baron longshore okay
[411:39.30]Does this person need it?
[411:40.82]Quick, take it!
[411:41.38]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!
[411:42.44]Take the invite, quick!
[411:44.58]Oh... Eh, maybe not.
[411:50.87]Maybe he didn't need it.
[411:57.97]Oh, an undead wouldn't say that.
[412:12.98]No, I wouldn't say that.
[412:17.21]Okay, I just had a... I thought 10 people spawned.
[412:31.21]What did you write, Herb?
[412:31.93]Yeah, I was saying what a tauren would say.
[412:35.42]Oh, I thought you were typing something and fucked it up.
[412:40.44]Yeah, a tauren would just be like...
[412:43.38]Ragefire Chasm is not going to go well.
[412:47.44]I'm ready for it though.
[412:56.01]Do we need anything else over here?
[412:57.86]Or do we turn around?
[413:18.17]Think we have to go down here.
[413:20.97]Those things are very... Oh, those are way... That might be very dangerous.
[413:29.90]Level 20?
[413:33.00]Oh, yeah.
[413:33.64]The escort quest in here is going to kill us.
[413:35.46]Yeah, no way.
[413:36.40]We probably shouldn't go in here.
[413:38.35]What are the level of the actual things in here?
[413:43.10]15?
[413:43.48]That's not... 20?
[413:44.78]These guys are level 15.
[413:49.07]Why would this be for level 20?
[413:52.05]Just be careful.
[413:52.53]We can be fine.
[413:57.21]What?
[413:57.55]Do we... Oh, we just have to get 10 medals?
[414:00.35]Look at the medals.
[414:01.57]And then I think we have to come back here and... Yeah, this is a part two, I think, to this.
[414:06.76]Three of us getting 10 medals.
[414:09.32]Yeah.
[414:10.58]I think they drop pretty fast, though.
[414:12.10]Plus, we can... You know what?
[414:13.32]Who cares?
[414:14.22]It is hardcore, but you know what?
[414:15.23]Let's fucking make it happen.
[414:19.53]I know what I'm doing.
[414:21.53]I was a bottom-ranked warlock in fucking TBC.
[414:24.33]I know what I'm up to.
[414:33.68]We already got one.
[414:43.77]Here we go.
[414:45.51]Smooth.
[415:12.21]Wait, I don't have this quest.
[415:13.25]Can you share?
[415:14.61]You don't have it?
[415:15.09]Yeah, I didn't pick up the level 20 quests.
[415:17.46]I was like, why am I not getting any of these medals?
[415:23.14]There it is.
[415:27.44]It wasn't the Blondin poster, was it?
[415:28.56]I don't think so.
[415:31.55]No, we did that one.
[415:45.07]And then it's time to do Ragefire Chasm.
[415:56.73]So how do you want to do, uh, RFC?
[415:58.55]Do you want to... Oops, sorry.
[415:59.83]Do you want to, um... I mean, you're currently on a non-Only Fangs character.
[416:07.66]Correct.
[416:08.26]We could just pug it with a bunch of... I mean, there could be... Pug is big air quotes.
[416:15.06]I'm afraid of getting, like, a bunch of, like, the random, like, Jerma community fuckfaces.
[416:19.90]I don't know.
[416:21.74]That might not be a good idea.
[416:24.76]What choice do we have?
[416:27.69]That might be a bad idea.
[416:35.59]I cannot confirm or deny if somebody would just, like, run and pull the whole instance.
[416:39.71]I don't know.
[416:40.41]There's no way to tell.
[416:53.19]I'm just imagining somebody being like, well, here's my shot.
[416:56.07]Straightening up their tie and aggroing the whole instance.
[417:02.35]There goes Rind.
[417:05.30]Oh, we missed it.
[417:06.34]That would be nice to have for the dungeon.
[417:17.20]Something about that is kind of, I don't know, it's kind of funny though.
[417:21.74]it's just rfc it's not it's not hard we'll be fine if they do that just roach yeah that's true
[417:49.65]Uh-oh.
[417:49.95]I thought you were tired to play Mario Odyssey.
[417:58.06]That's what I'm going to do all day?
[418:05.52]Oh, level 17.
[418:06.50]That's not good.
[418:08.28]Yeah, we're in here.
[418:10.50]We are in here.
[418:11.22]And they're going to respawn on the way out too.
[418:15.66]they're gonna uh should we do the escort I feel like the escort might be I'd say no because we're gonna have to come back here anyways for the quest where we have to kill I don't think we want to fight captain fairmount and all that shit right now no I don't think so and that's all in here running with randos isn't too bad I won't I run with randos
[418:45.78]Yeah, I'm just kidding around.
[418:47.16]I'm sure if people play it, it'll be fine.
[419:02.40]I can't get over my guy's little speedo.
[419:04.30]It's distracting.
[419:14.49]All I see is these pale legs just sticking out.
[419:18.57]Of a pair of.
[419:20.30]Root of the loom underwear.
[419:21.32]Yeah, let's let's we should just kill the ones out here.
[419:33.50]The best part is you're wearing like a tie as well, so you're in full work from home gear.
[419:39.69]Like you got it, you gotta be in the zoom call.
[419:42.45]Yeah, this is a zoom call up, but you're right.
[419:50.36]Because from here, this is very, very corporate.
[419:57.76]Just don't stand up.
[420:20.54]Kill boss guys.
[420:22.70]Oh no, we're not yet.
[420:32.23]Don't follow me.
[420:35.91]Yes, you are.
[420:37.03]Wait, what?
[420:41.51]Wait, I'm not lying.
[420:52.00]I'm talking about guns of the Northwatch, I think.
[420:57.27]Oh, the one we already did?
[420:59.29]No, the one we just left because we didn't want to do.
[421:01.39]Oh, you know what?
[421:04.51]If we got four, I think we could do it.
[421:08.53]Two what?
[421:09.01]Two priests?
[421:10.77]Two priests, warrior, warlock.
[421:12.15]Yeah, well, there's no way we're going to die.
[421:16.56]We can do it.
[421:30.01]And look, if it gets hairy, I'll just rip my Ethernet cord out.
[421:34.82]And I'll be fine.
[421:35.76]It's like you get out.
[421:43.22]Lag tech.
[421:50.11]Yeah, old school Petri flask.
[421:52.65]You get it.
[421:58.46]I gotta get off because mom needs to use the phone I should let me do this let me be useful do you still have a uh hell stone I do
[422:31.15]I don't want any cheese!
[422:35.64]Hold on, I gotta make health stones for people.
[422:48.49]Thank you!
[422:55.22]Undead Female has a good voice, it's funny.
[422:57.54]Alright, this is what we came here with this many people for.
[423:05.36]Let me see that DPS.
[423:18.71]Oh, hold on.
[423:23.05]Let's go.
[423:27.23]Hold on.
[423:28.17]The level 18 is going to smoke us.
[423:30.97]Oh yeah?
[423:32.30]Just wait.
[423:38.08]Is this the RFC group?
[423:39.96]Double Priest RFC?
[423:41.16]I don't know.
[423:46.48]Trying to call dips?
[423:53.29]Touchdown isn't ready yet.
[424:15.29]How I get beaten by two fucking priests?
[424:19.62]I told you.
[424:26.35]Oh, they're four levels higher than me.
[424:27.75]That's where it's true.
[424:44.32]How am I supposed to generate rage better?
[424:47.04]I have like 15 abilities that use it and like one that makes it.
[424:51.95]Sunder armor.
[424:55.01]I know you just gotta keep up sunders.
[424:58.61]Sunder cost rage.
[425:01.41]Oh, you said how do you build... I don't know.
[425:03.73]My brain thought that was threat for a second.
[425:05.29]I don't know why.
[425:07.64]Berserker rage.
[425:08.82]I know there's a couple of big ones.
[425:25.87]Yeah, more damage is more rage.
[425:30.26]Charge listening charge.
[425:32.96]Do you want to invite the third?
[425:36.60]How many priests do we have here?
[425:40.32]We have, I think there are three priests.
[425:46.04]Do you want to do three priests warlock warrior?
[425:54.93]That's just dumb enough to work.
[426:27.59]Sometimes he takes a long time to spawn.
[426:29.15]There's a lot of people in this room.
[426:31.23]Yeah.
[426:49.99]I don't even have time to attack anything!
[426:56.54]Our party is too strong.
[426:57.96]I'm only 14.
[427:01.06]Do you want to invite the other dude?
[427:09.35]Oh yeah.
[427:19.05]I'm breaking TOS right now because I'm 14.
[427:33.04]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[427:33.70]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[427:34.46]We need to all be kind of here.
[427:35.52]This happens pretty quickly.
[427:38.56]Wait.
[427:39.90]Did you get it?
[427:41.01]Yeah, but we shouldn't do the escort to leave before we kill the bosses because we're going to have to come back.
[427:45.85]Oh, fuck.
[427:48.01]We should just probably let them die so we can kill because we're just going to have to go outside and back inside and outside again.
[427:56.49]die wait do we even have the quest for the boss cap oh shit can we go up the run up there oh no yeah just just let this poor blood elf die I can't have that happen blood elves are my friends I'm a blood elf so I've been told by my channel I'll fucking let him die I don't care
[428:30.86]I want to see a lot of minus twos for that one.
[428:36.51]The only thing missing there was the sneaky Kevin MacLeod music.
[428:40.29]I didn't put it on.
[428:40.87]He's dead.
[428:47.34]The alliance spy op is complete.
[428:50.83]They already killed him?
[428:53.01]How did he die already?
[429:09.97]the night elves send their regards that does not bode well for us considering he was 20. alright this room sucks there's like two people on the other side
[429:43.71]Clean.
[429:50.97]It should be.
[429:51.41]We've got a whole ass dungeon party in here.
[429:54.99]Abandon that quest.
[429:56.95]Oh shit, that's right.
[429:57.69]Yeah, make sure you abandon the escort quest.
[430:09.06]Okay.
[430:09.34]Someone aggroed the boss.
[430:10.35]It's okay.
[430:13.25]We're good.
[430:13.47]We're good.
[430:15.13]Build a marine first.
[430:19.05]There's a preserver over here too.
[430:20.21]Uh oh.
[430:23.28]Watch out for fears.
[430:26.68]See ya.
[430:28.48]Are we running?
[430:28.92]We're going to get the fuck out of here.
[430:31.52]Out.
[430:31.72]Out.
[430:31.88]Out.
[430:32.06]Everyone out.
[430:34.20]I'm going to kill myself.
[430:35.03]Oh my god.
[430:36.91]Wait, are you roaching down there?
[430:38.85]We're running, right?
[430:40.27]Are we running?
[430:41.55]We got it.
[430:41.89]We got it.
[430:42.15]We got it.
[430:42.41]We got it.
[430:42.67]We got it.
[430:44.03]We good?
[430:45.27]Yeah, we're good.
[430:48.12]Okay.
[430:49.14]Let's be more careful next time.
[430:52.04]Wait, Captain Fairmont is almost dead.
[430:53.48]I'll be back.
[430:58.36]We just did it.
[431:05.86]Oh, what's up?
[431:06.60]Hi, livestream fails.
[431:09.60]Did we win?
[431:10.06]Alright, I did jump off the... I jumped off from the top, and I didn't realize that I probably could have killed myself if I hit the bottom.
[431:30.73]I got out of there, man.
[431:32.78]I couldn't do it.
[431:36.40]Oh, okay.
[431:37.00]Time to analyze everybody's clips.
[431:38.94]Who pulled?
[431:39.61]Okay, we need to know who to blame.
[431:41.31]I thought we got spawned on and we had ten, we had like seven people and then I saw run in the chat and then I started screaming run.
[431:52.70]Hey, we lived.
[431:53.50]We're fine.
[431:54.00]Everything's good.
[431:55.50]Now we just gotta wait for the respawn.
[431:58.04]Oh my god, please don't kill me.
[432:00.90]I need to relax.
[432:02.14]What is that?
[432:02.44]I'm so wound up after that.
[432:04.30]Who's still in the tower?
[432:06.88]You?
[432:07.70]I panicked so much.
[432:09.06]Make sure your Voidwalker is off of defense.
[432:16.60]I didn't roach instantly.
[432:18.06]It was... It was probably... I don't know.
[432:21.04]Oh, right.
[432:23.42]We have to kill the other towers, right?
[432:27.92]I turned around and saw a priest casting heal.
[432:30.76]And I thought it was heal on the boss.
[432:35.02]And then I almost jumped to my death.
[433:04.00]Average undead player.
[433:08.48]I think OK, if you want to know what's funny about this, I think that there's actually one party member who has no idea why we are in a party of five.
[433:17.84]Oh, we got this.
[433:18.69]There's somebody here that's not currently here on the stream.
[433:21.09]Probably might even be more than one.
[433:31.04]That person is just like, wow, I love this community.
[433:34.11]They are so nice and friendly and helpful.
[433:36.36]The WoW Hardcore community is great.
[433:47.99]plus in that in the towers just line of sight it's hard to even a tower get anything it's like you I I've I would have been happier if we all ran out and just let them funnel out through and fight them there there's my reasoning okay um counterpoint if we weren't in a party of five we probably would have taken it slower and then those dudes would have respawned behind you you would have dropped into like the out of the frying pan situation that's true
[434:29.71]I just noticed like I'm the only tauren and you guys are just like a bunch of little undead dudes yeah you you got a group of um little weasels behind you
[435:12.14]very nice I'm not doing that don't worry the priest can catch you
[435:43.75]There's one more boss, right?
[436:01.88]Mind Blast is such a good move.
[436:04.02]That's why I wanted to make a Shadow Priest.
[436:06.38]The thing can just crit for so much damage.
[436:08.12]Just so good.
[436:44.43]Yeah, I saw this person attacking and I freaked out.
[437:22.08]Chaos Criss Angel.
[437:27.84]That's worth a chuckle.
[437:49.17]Wands really just do so much damage.
[438:02.84]Yeah, I think in an ideal world before doing RFC, I would learn two handers and then train it up, but I don't think we have time for that.
[438:13.51]We also could just do it tomorrow.
[438:22.22]I think we can do it today.
[438:23.00]I don't need to know no sense in rushing right Pearl.
[438:46.37]Good for tailoring.
[439:19.04]Now we can do the escort.
[439:21.82]Holy shit.
[439:23.99]I can't take all that.
[439:25.71]I can't take all that.
[439:27.95]I'll take the pearl.
[439:28.69]I can't take all that.
[439:30.69]There's a lot of generous cloth.
[439:46.86]You might need to put that in the chat.
[439:48.59]I think that's the person who is not in the stream.
[439:50.85]Oh.
[439:52.51]Wait, this person... Oh, hold on.
[439:53.85]They're just actually doing it?
[439:55.09]This is not somebody in chat.
[439:57.43]So I just look like a weird person.
[439:59.75]Okay, hold on.
[440:00.59]Wait.
[440:01.21]Wait, wait, wait.
[440:01.97]Hold on.
[440:02.29]Wait, wait, wait.
[440:03.51]Oops, sorry.
[440:05.23]Nah, this is where I put the ring in.
[440:06.31]This is where I put the other ring in.
[440:15.44]Uh, thanks.
[440:24.33]Just assuming that they're in the chat.
[440:26.75]What an egomaniac.
[440:27.53]I paid for it.
[440:27.81]How much is um... I get five silver?
[440:55.08]hold on wait a minute it is more that gave me more money for it so now I I actually like paid for it oh okay
[441:35.91]I'm not doing first aid.
[441:37.25]Oh, okay.
[441:38.45]Somebody said, Jerma, you are fumbling the rando.
[441:47.32]I know.
[441:47.94]Why am I acting like Mr. Magoo?
[441:49.48]I'm like Mr. Bean right now.
[441:51.32]Maybe I should give you an extra 20 in silver.
[441:54.34]I'm going to jump off and roach and fucking die by suicide by jumping off.
[442:02.29]Oh.
[442:07.02]A small pill.
[442:13.67]What could that cost?
[442:14.91]Five silver.
[442:16.33]Alright, so now I'll make sure you abandon the.
[442:22.05]Uh, the quest you had it failed one.
[442:31.83]I think I abandoned it, but I don't know where the dude is.
[442:33.87]It might be someone else doing it.
[442:36.70]Mr. Bean would try to roach, but accidentally lead all the mobs off a cliff and save the raid.
[442:45.87]Yeah.
[442:46.99]That would be a great episode.
[442:52.29]Choo-choo.
[442:53.77]Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-choo-choo.
[442:58.49]Choo-choo.
[442:59.19]Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-choo-choo.
[443:10.99]I cannot hear any of the trance.
[443:14.27]Hey, why is your game not doing dialog?
[443:15.98]I don't know.
[443:26.82]Oh, those are good.
[443:34.29]Is it good for... I got three priests here.
[443:37.05]Hey, Chris could use them.
[443:46.40]I really am a little brother.
[443:49.32]This is a little brother name.
[443:51.54]I'm leveled under everybody here.
[443:56.27]And I'm being called by my first name.
[443:58.95]I have to be 13 years old.
[444:17.87]Oh shit.
[444:19.05]Those are so much better.
[444:22.76]Two intellect boost stamina?
[444:26.64]Yeah, I actually got shoes on now.
[444:30.34]Well, he passed on it.
[444:31.70]Thank you.
[444:37.59]I can hear things again.
[444:41.13]Apparently dialog was turned off.
[444:47.15]Where'd you get the tux?
[444:48.37]Uh, somebody made it.
[444:52.60]Oh, I just heard the dreaded sound.
[444:54.10]Okay.
[445:04.66]What would be a worse sound that you would hear?
[445:06.94]Uh, like let's say you were walking like down the street or you, you know, you are out wherever.
[445:14.25]would you rather hear the Jaws theme start playing?
[445:19.07]And you just say, what the fuck's going on?
[445:21.51]Is that worse?
[445:22.81]Or... Which one of those two things would be worse in your mind?
[445:29.52]The Metal Gear Solid exclamation sound.
[445:39.39]Ring!
[445:41.87]The second one, but you don't know what they're aggroing to.
[445:48.55]The Jaws theme, that could mean a lot of stuff.
[445:50.57]That could be dangerous right around you.
[446:03.86]They could be allies?
[446:07.16]Yeah, but they're aggroing on someone.
[446:10.95]The question is who?
[446:27.36]Oh, God.
[446:56.37]No.
[447:23.48]no you wouldn't you wouldn't keep the same I remember you would keep the same name sitting in a room with three randoms twiddling your thumbs yeah that's that is what we're doing have you ever bought like the robux for a niece or nephew
[447:51.92]No, I bought Robux for me.
[447:55.73]Okay, is it bad that instead of spending Robux on nieces and nephews, I bought it for myself first?
[448:20.47]But that was for a stream though.
[448:21.57]I had to make sure I got the funny outfit.
[448:40.08]If we had that rested XP thing, would there be fire alarms going off yelling at us to leave?
[448:50.83]If we did what?
[448:53.37]If we had that add-on, the rested XP add-on, would it be saying, hey, get out of here?
[448:57.64]Why are you here?
[448:58.72]It would be like, you have been level 14 for three and a half hours.
[449:03.68]Your XP rate is... How much money you got, Alex?
[449:15.39]You trying to make me lose it all?
[449:17.41]You know I'm not going to ever beat you in a gamble.
[449:23.65]I have 52 silver.
[449:24.57]Okay, so this is for 20 silver.
[449:26.89]Between me and... Naraxus?
[449:30.71]What do you start?
[449:31.39]1,000?
[449:31.93]How does this work?
[449:38.84]And then I do 969, right?
[449:39.48]Nice.
[449:39.72]Okay.
[449:55.66]Getting there.
[449:56.80]23.
[449:56.82]Oh, shit.
[449:58.49]8.
[449:58.51]Uh-oh.
[449:59.37]Hold on, hold on.
[450:06.21]We're just in here throwing dice at the ground, putting coins, and we're just going to get killed.
[450:10.12]Okay, we're 18.
[450:17.90]There we are.
[450:29.29]Okay.
[450:29.81]Uh-oh.
[450:34.87]Yeah!
[450:35.81]Good game.
[450:40.51]Can you death roll with people outside the guild?
[450:45.15]Oh, can you?
[450:45.97]Are you not supposed to do this?
[450:47.41]I mean, they have to trade you the money, right?
[450:52.82]I think that death rolling is not a handout.
[450:54.44]Death rolling is gambling, right?
[451:01.29]Holy shit.
[451:01.91]Look at this.
[451:02.35]I got 72 now.
[451:02.89]You want to double down?
[451:09.40]40?
[451:12.18]This person has a main character with like 150 gold.
[451:16.22]That's alright.
[451:16.62]I'll vacuum all of it up right now.
[451:27.53]This guy does not like gambling.
[451:30.77]They're throwing dice.
[451:32.91]Disgusting gambling.
[451:36.17]What is this, a pub?
[451:37.13]Are we in a pub?
[451:39.53]Slay them.
[451:46.51]Alright, 40 gold.
[451:50.91]Who am I doing this with?
[451:58.64]Not 40 gold, 40 silver.
[452:08.78]Alright, I'll start it.
[452:12.11]Alright, 707.
[452:19.91]Oh, that's bad, but 707 to 505.
[452:21.83]Wicked.
[452:21.99]Still in my favor right now.
[452:37.70]oh too bad I won damn chat I've known Jerm a long time the only way to beat him at gambling is not to play I just crossed one gold you want to go talyx
[453:04.68]No.
[453:05.86]No, no, no.
[453:06.42]Something small.
[453:06.98]Ten silver.
[453:12.84]Do one gold with somebody now?
[453:14.56]Oh, that's my entire bankroll.
[453:16.48]I don't know.
[453:17.81]What do you think, Etalyx?
[453:21.83]Ten silver?
[453:23.61]Alright.
[453:24.13]I'll give you ten silver.
[453:25.49]Let's roll.
[453:27.05]You want to start it?
[453:30.39]Have we determined who's...
[453:32.99]got the advantage?
[453:33.77]Like, is the person that starts at the advantage or disadvantage?
[453:38.63]I don't know.
[453:39.13]I would imagine it's the person that... I think probably the person that goes second.
[453:44.61]Holy shit!
[453:45.65]What the fuck did you just do?
[453:47.71]I told you!
[453:48.72]What?
[453:51.98]No fucking way!
[453:56.84]That is, uh, incredibly not, uh, that's very unlucky.
[454:01.32]Thanks for playing.
[454:02.42]holy shit hey well we did thankfully it was not for very much well I'm a real scumbag I've only I've taken money from almost everybody here
[454:26.48]That was actually outrageous though.
[454:28.94]Truly completely outrageous.
[454:30.88]I knew it was going to be bad, but I didn't know it was going to be that bad.
[454:39.97]I just like accepted it and then slash forfeited.
[454:43.11]No, no.
[454:50.10]We got the guy.
[454:51.80]The guy's here.
[454:59.85]Alright, make sure you got it and you can accept it.
[455:04.16]You have a higher chance of getting a knife in Counter-Strike than you doing that, by the way.
[455:08.70]Did you guys all accept?
[455:10.16]Yep.
[455:12.24]Yeah, somebody said that there's a higher chance to get a knife in Counter-Strike.
[455:22.61]Okay, I got all the bad luck out of my system in one go.
[455:27.15]Yeah, I'm going to be thinking, I'm going to be in the shower like tomorrow morning and I was going to think of that one.
[455:31.17]And that's because I was laughing.
[455:33.89]Like on the first roll too.
[455:36.11]So I think I answered my question because my question was who is at the disadvantage?
[455:40.64]I've never seen that before.
[455:41.90]Or the person who rolls second.
[455:43.56]And I think we know.
[455:44.34]Oh, that's so funny.
[456:07.25]He was smoking me right now.
[456:10.99]Oh, the caster in the back was just annihilating me.
[456:18.11]Uh, by the way, I think, uh... I think we may have to do RFC another day.
[456:25.11]Going on eight hours.
[456:26.59]I need to eat some food.
[456:27.89]I'm getting kind of tired.
[456:29.33]Tank, tank, tank.
[456:35.17]Hey, I've got to 15 though.
[456:37.55]Got like five levels.
[456:38.43]That's good.
[457:20.82]we got a lot done we ramped up the exp in the last like two hours or so two levels in like an hour and a half that's pretty good chat seven hours is like 16 hours in streamer hours
[457:48.44]uh yeah do you want to let's do rfc what what's your what's your what's your schedule like what do you you want to do it in the next day or two I mean uh yeah I I feel like you you want to do it now you just can't I want to do it now I just I need to go and I think by the time that I ate and came back I'd probably be like yeah I'm done
[458:17.24]Well, you've got a few more minutes to go because this is a long-ass escort.
[458:20.44]It's true.
[458:27.13]We have to go all the way back to Ratchet.
[458:32.83]Oh, that sucks ass.
[458:33.67]That's right.
[458:34.05]This is going to take a while.
[458:44.28]Why did that not kill us?
[459:02.05]Are you streaming tomorrow?
[459:05.49]That would be a first in a very long time.
[459:11.05]We'll see.
[459:12.07]When do you want to do it?
[459:14.05]I mean, I want to do it tomorrow, but... Tomorrow... Tomorrow morning.
[459:18.70]We'll see.
[459:21.42]At the very least...
[459:25.89]Two days from now, I'd say at the maximum because I'm having fun.
[459:29.33]This is I love this is a great time.
[459:33.82]Yeah, warrior seems cool.
[459:34.80]I just need more of my like my toolkit.
[459:38.92]And I need to figure out how to make a macro.
[459:45.48]Oh yeah, macros are.
[459:47.36]I screwed it up earlier too.
[459:52.43]And these streams are, these are very, I mean, I'm kind of just relaxing and playing and just, we're talking.
[459:58.55]It's not, and I already know a lot about WoW.
[460:01.65]It's not like I'm spending a lot of energy going, what the fuck does this do?
[460:04.55]What is life tap?
[460:05.77]What, I don't know.
[460:06.37]What is, what is drain soul?
[460:07.96]I kind of already know a lot of this stuff.
[460:12.74]Tons of stuff I don't know, obviously.
[460:14.20]I need to go to WoW, um, platinum, whatever.
[460:25.47]Do you think you could name more World of Warcraft leaders or presidents?
[460:55.51]Presidents, for sure.
[460:59.60]And I only say that because there are eight WoW leaders.
[461:03.68]And... Well, no, there's more than that.
[461:06.22]I mean, like, leaders throughout all time.
[461:12.43]So, through all of Warcraft history.
[461:15.17]Yeah, like, all of Warcraft lore.
[461:18.97]I think it would still be Presidents.
[461:28.42]I'm not a big WoW lore nerd or anything.
[461:30.92]I just really like the games.
[461:39.14]Oh shit, those are good too.
[461:41.22]Ooh.
[461:44.08]Yeah, roll on those if you need them.
[461:46.16]Those are good.
[461:54.23]And to be fair, the WoW lore is kind of
[461:59.54]We are in constant conflict.
[462:03.59]Yes, friend.
[462:04.99]The humans, they are attacking us.
[462:17.50]I mean, the stuff with the... Well, like Magderidon's blood and they drank it and they became corrupted or whatever.
[462:26.41]I mean, that's cool.
[462:28.29]Gul'dan, Dark Portal, Medivh.
[462:30.35]That's all cool, but it kind of all just boils down to that guy is hitting me in the head with a big hammer.
[462:37.24]And so I'm going to try to hit him in the head with a bigger hammer.
[462:50.51]There's also real life history too.
[462:52.08]That's the history of everything.
[463:01.30]And then the new WoW lore is... I... They've gone... It kind of reminds me of when an anime gets to like the 50th episode.
[463:12.41]And they start bringing in... Oh, by the way, yeah, that guy's a planet.
[463:17.51]He showed up and he's going to stab the planet and he's a planet.
[463:21.08]And there's a whole galaxy of these people.
[463:25.36]And now there's a giant sword sticking out of the Earth, and it's 700,000 feet tall, and it's made out of radiation.
[463:34.75]Oh, and there's another dimension too.
[463:35.77]There's three dimensions.
[463:37.07]The progression of anime is, I'm in danger, then we're in danger, then my class is in danger, then my school is in danger, then my world is in danger, and then my universe is in danger.
[463:51.55]Yeah, that's true.
[463:52.47]If WoW started in a classroom, yeah, then it would be interesting.
[464:17.82]Time is in danger.
[464:18.88]Let's kill God together to save everyone.
[464:21.00]Yeah.
[464:25.05]Don't worry.
[464:25.53]They'll just open up a portal somewhere.
[464:29.05]Give them another year and a half.
[464:33.13]If the planet is a character, does that make us like fleas that are just itching it?
[464:40.40]Kind of, yeah.
[464:43.79]I will give credit to retail.
[464:46.99]The world soul zone in War Within is pretty cool.
[464:53.15]It's very ominous.
[464:55.11]It's a very interesting zone.
[464:56.23]It can change from light to dark.
[464:59.06]It's hella fall.
[465:00.54]It's actually really cool.
[465:06.20]The giant world soul just goes brrrr.
[465:09.22]It does the, uh, the Christopher Nolan sound.
[465:13.75]And the world changes.
[465:14.69]Oh, did you know that he uses practical effects whenever possible?
[465:24.58]Based.
[465:31.60]Get back here.
[465:46.23]How come Chris and Jonathan Nolan haven't directed an Avengers movie yet?
[466:16.95]Can you say the thing you just said about Christopher Nolan?
[466:21.55]You said the last thing you just said about it.
[466:24.46]It's not worth repeating.
[466:26.56]Just say it again.
[466:28.14]Okay.
[466:28.76]I said, how come Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan haven't made an Avengers movie together yet?
[466:35.63]Oh, before that.
[466:36.29]The thing right before that.
[466:39.41]Is it about practical effects?
[466:43.94]Did you know that Christopher Nolan used as many practical effects as possible?
[466:48.38]That's neat.
[466:57.76]Time to level up.
[467:01.90]I'm getting a lot of good replacements now.
[467:08.98]Did you say he said it was neat?
[467:11.20]Is that based on what?
[467:14.30]Well, somebody made fun of me because I said based and then I had to fix it.
[467:20.56]25 silver.
[467:21.11]Holy shit, that's a lot.
[467:30.43]5% mana at this low level is not going to help at all.
[467:38.23]Can you daze bosses?
[467:43.15]I have no idea.
[467:48.58]So this is meant just for mobs in PvP.
[467:52.88]It's going to be this one.
[467:53.84]I need the cast time reduction.
[468:10.54]yeah thanks for group be careful out there talk to me sell what I got a lot of shit
[468:42.82]Okay, at the first second I was like, wait, that was not cloth, right?
[468:54.01]What are you looking for?
[468:57.33]Me?
[468:59.07]Oh, Swiftness Potion?
[469:01.07]I appreciate it.
[469:01.65]10 silver?
[469:02.43]10 silver?
[469:10.91]How much do these go for on the auction house?
[469:12.83]And I mean it because I actually really want a swiftness potion.
[469:16.23]You should get one of these two Etalyx.
[469:24.18]It's like 20.
[469:24.76]These things are expensive.
[469:30.70]That's actually fair for 10 silver.
[469:35.24]Is it an auction house if you just get other people to buy it and then trade them?
[469:42.00]15.
[469:42.04]I'm not getting scammed, right?
[469:49.26]It's 20 to 35.
[469:49.86]15.
[469:49.92]Alright, I'll do 15.
[469:57.59]You can't trade with... Yeah, I'm sorry.
[470:00.09]I got to play by the rules, but I'm going to join that guild.
[470:07.07]I appreciate it, though.
[470:10.56]Because, okay, fool me once, shame on me.
[470:12.92]Fool me twice, shame on me.
[470:14.38]Fool me five times, you're getting G-kicked.
[470:29.89]Is the only way to get that to, like, either drop it?
[470:35.67]You can't, like, buy that recipe, right?
[470:38.37]Except the auction house?
[470:40.89]I think the recipe for swiftness is, I think you just get it at the baseline of alchemy, I think, later.
[470:51.27]They're just so valuable.
[470:53.42]Because I have alchemy on my shaman, but I never got the swiftness potion one.
[471:03.26]It's a pattern drop?
[471:04.16]Oh, okay.
[471:17.90]Oh yeah, I think we can get two just from going to... Doing a quest to deliver the thing to Thunder Bluff.
[471:30.63]Oh, we could do the run.
[471:31.41]I might start with that tomorrow.
[471:34.83]Maybe we could just go there tomorrow.
[471:38.17]So you are streaming tomorrow?
[471:40.97]I want to at least do RFC.
[471:43.49]You got to at least do a dungeon within a day or two, a few days.
[471:48.19]Okay, I can't... I'm not going to say that tomorrow is going to be an eight-hour stream, though.
[471:51.47]Tomorrow, the goal is RFC.
[471:55.53]And then... That might be it.
[472:13.40]You think you'll be around tomorrow, Alex?
[472:15.52]Yeah, I'll be around tomorrow.
[472:18.95]go into rfc fall from a great height die turn off the stream it's easy definitely you being a tank definitely makes that process much easier we'll see about that so do you want to just get randoms or do you want to try to grab people if anybody has any alts or something
[472:41.76]Up to you.
[472:43.04]I gotta figure out a way to get in contact with Soda somehow, because he tried to invite me yesterday and I just auto-declined it.
[472:59.83]I don't think I'm allowed to have this dude in the guild until I hit a certain level.
[473:06.12]You're not allowed to have an alt in the guild until you earn it.
[473:14.16]Or you could just be like, hey, invite me and this dude.
[473:19.08]P.S.
[473:19.22]He's already in the guild.
[473:20.28]And he's probably just cheating this whole time, y'all.
[473:24.40]This goes to Booty Bay, right?
[473:27.73]Yeah, the boat.
[473:49.35]But yeah, thanks for playing, dude.
[473:51.17]We'll see you tomorrow.
[473:51.93]Yeah, it's been fun.
[473:54.11]Do RFC.
[473:56.87]Big levels, new powers.
[474:00.26]Some impressive gambling results.
[474:04.72]That was unbelievable.
[474:05.92]I've never seen something like that before.
[474:16.65]Alright, talk to you tomorrow.
[474:20.13]Are you starting early?
[474:22.17]Probably around the same time.
[474:24.33]11.30, 12-ish.
[474:29.00]Sounds good.
[474:29.72]I got a little late today, but I can be there a little earlier tomorrow.
[474:34.94]I don't have to do it right away either.
[474:36.20]Because I could do professions and there's a couple other little quests I can finish up.
[474:40.80]Just whenever you're around, just let me know.
[474:48.87]I think we have all the quests already.
[474:51.51]We should have pretty much everything.
[474:52.85]The only thing I'm going to do is probably just train up the swords.
[474:56.73]Yeah, that does take a little bit.
[475:03.58]All the way to Undercity to learn it, I think.
[475:09.35]Sounds good.
[475:10.43]I'll talk to you tomorrow.
[475:12.16]Alright.
[475:12.74]Bye, chat.
[475:14.80]Don't smell too bad.
[475:16.54]Can we get a little shout for Etalyx, please?
[475:18.40]Can we put his stream in the chat?
[475:21.79]Etalyx streams as well.
[475:28.09]For those of you that didn't know.
[475:32.68]This guy convinced me to play World of Warcraft because he's been playing it and he's like, you gotta play.
[475:40.95]So I said, if you can't beat him, join him.
[475:43.60]Yeah, I've been the annoying WoW friend.
[475:46.02]I admit it.
[475:50.64]It's so funny because I asked, I was like, oh, hey, so, hey, like, Vinny, Ster, poke, hey, what do you think?
[475:59.14]It was a resounding no across the board.
[476:02.69]That was me at first too, but I think what got me is just the classic portion.
[476:07.75]Yeah.
[476:08.89]Yeah.
[476:10.34]Poke did already play, though.
[476:11.30]Poke did go through an entire two different arcs over months.
[476:15.20]So, I can understand why he would want to wait until it happens again, maybe.
[476:24.79]Vinny's playing Hello Kitty.
[476:26.03]It's a superior game.
[476:27.13]Alright, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
[476:38.84]Okay.
[476:39.68]Bye, everybody.
[476:40.98]Bye.
[476:41.78]Good night.
[476:44.18]He didn't even get to say good night.
[476:50.35]Dude, I just got my food and the edibles just kicked in.
[476:52.95]Please just do Ragefire now.
[476:55.25]That person got, like, snacks ready.
[477:01.05]I just imagine somebody with one of those... Like, Taco Bell boxes.
[477:07.21]That have the box, and it's got a bunch of... It's got a Cheesy Goatita Crunch.
[477:10.42]Ow.
[477:11.26]It's got a Cheesy Goatita... I just bumped the mic.
[477:13.54]Cheesy Goatita Crunch.
[477:14.88]Doritos Locos.
[477:16.44]You got Crazy Sticks, whatever it's called.
[477:18.32]A big, large Fanta.
[477:26.87]I don't know why I picture this person with sunglasses on while they're watching, but I just do.
[477:35.13]Alright, that's going to be it.
[477:36.67]I'm going to log in the inn here.
[477:46.36]After tomorrow?
[477:49.42]I don't think we're going to do four days in a row.
[477:58.93]I want to do at least Ragefire.
[478:08.77]That's right.
[478:09.09]You know I'm getting up.
[478:11.57]There he is.
[478:12.11]Chaos Chris.
[478:21.69]He looks fine.
[478:22.49]He doesn't look... He looks good.
[478:24.53]Delete him?
[478:25.33]What?
[478:25.53]Why would I delete him?
[478:42.51]It's kind of loud.
[478:44.55]I'll turn it down.
[478:51.57]Oops.
[478:55.11]The impulsive devil on your shoulder.
[479:06.05]Yeah, I've not done an eight hour stream in a long time, and I know I said it was never going to happen ever again.
[479:15.45]Yeah, but I've been doing this for nearly 15 years.
[479:20.25]I think everybody knows that half the shit I say just doesn't end up coming true, ever.
[479:36.29]But yeah, I'll see you guys soon.
[479:37.93]Tomorrow, 11.30, 12-ish.
[479:41.36]I'll make sure to eat a big lunch like I did today, but a big lunch only takes you about 8 or 9 hours, so I gotta get some food.
[479:59.19]Yeah, Vinny, I'll rate Vinny, sure.
[480:00.79]He's playing Hello Kitty game.
[480:04.15]Go watch the Superior game.
[480:09.79]Go say hi to Vinny.
[480:21.23]Did it actually cross eight hours?
[480:25.09]Oh, wow, it actually did.
[480:25.79]Alright, let's get the raid going.
[480:32.95]Take it easy, guys.
[480:33.43]See you tomorrow.
[480:34.88]Ragefire chasm.
[480:36.28]We either do it or we die.
[480:38.76]Place your bets.
[480:43.30]Take care.
[480:43.88]See you soon.
[480:45.18]Have a good one.
[481:01.48]you
[481:36.43]you
