[02:30.77]Okay.
[02:31.18]Looks like I'm just going to return it.
[02:38.78]Do it while you play House Flippers.
[02:40.80]That would just be odd.
[02:45.68]Why would I be dressed up as a cowboy?
[02:47.42]I guess maybe I'm just a cowboy?
[02:55.66]Who cares?
[02:56.98]Turn your cam on.
[02:58.12]Turn your cam on.
[02:59.32]I... Why?

[03:49.89]I bought everything.
[03:53.18]Yeah, and don't, let, let, I want you to show people this.
[03:55.83]When they say, this dude doesn't do what he says.
[03:58.95]He does, he does not go back on his word.
[04:00.87]If he says he's gonna play a game, he's gonna play it.
[04:04.17]Like, if he says he's gonna play a game tomorrow, he's gonna do it.
[04:09.10]Let me just get this open, hold on.
[04:15.02]Alright, let's, let's go.
[04:15.82]We're gonna play House Flippers DLC.
[04:17.66]Play Saw then.
[04:18.59]I never promised anything with Saw.
[04:22.68]This all had no promises.
[04:26.96]Hey, look, there it is.
[04:27.66]House Flipper.
[04:30.54]You guys remember this game?
[04:32.38]Ah.
[04:34.08]Wait, let's take a look around.
[04:35.06]He's a double liar.
[04:36.65]What are you going to do?
[04:38.99]Resident Evil 4.
[04:40.73]That's probably never going to happen.
[04:45.19]Unless it's on the Wii.
[04:46.47]The PC one I found was going to make me sick.
[04:50.55]But hey, take a look at this, right?
[04:51.85]Oh, let's get it.
[04:54.55]Uh, last time we played House Flipper, H, G, T, well, this is Garden Flipper, actually.
[04:59.70]Last time we played this, I made this sick garden.
[05:06.04]Remember this?
[05:09.16]This is the old house.
[05:10.42]I don't know why I thought it just said, pour wallet out.
[05:16.04]Like, dump money in here?
[05:18.20]This is pretty sick.
[05:21.22]Oh yeah, right, it's the Family Guy house.
[05:26.04]This is supposed to be the Griffin house, I forgot.
[05:28.64]This is an expensive ass house.
[05:35.82]What else, what else is back here?
[05:39.00]Oh yeah, the AOL, oh right, the projector, right?
[05:41.56]It's gonna be movie night, you can come park and watch TV, make pizzas.
[05:45.80]I forgot about this game, I love this game.
[05:47.46]Alright, let's go.
[05:49.40]There's a kiddie pool.
[05:53.09]Another pond with some seagulls.
[05:54.89]Technic table.
[05:59.21]What else is back here?
[06:03.22]Grill, right?
[06:06.32]Nice.
[06:07.44]That's a pretty good gamer.
[06:08.52]That's a gamer fridge.
[06:09.46]That's a huge gamer fridge.
[06:14.38]Stove.
[06:16.18]Here are the seats.
[06:21.34]And don't- aren't these actually connected to plumbing too, by the way?
[06:25.50]You think this is just a funny joke for the stream?
[06:28.34]No, there's actual plumbing down here.
[06:31.44]I remember that.
[06:33.66]Big beanbag chair.
[06:34.58]This is a cool color scheme.
[06:37.26]I forgot about this!
[06:38.06]Let me look around.
[06:41.91]Oh yeah, there's two toilets.
[06:43.81]I gotta remember this.
[06:44.49]This is my design philosophy.
[06:49.67]Eat well, you shit.
[06:53.35]Technically.
[06:55.61]Why are there three sinks?
[06:56.99]Because it's like a public restroom.
[06:58.27]What the hell is going on up here?
[07:05.73]Oh, that's right.
[07:06.28]The pool was too expensive, so I made just one of those swim forward while the current tries to take you machines.
[07:20.36]Oh, this is where it happened, right?
[07:22.12]This is where it was.
[07:23.18]I feel like I'm in some old historic house, like an old streamer house.
[07:28.38]This is where he did the worst impression of 2018.
[07:31.42]Yeah, I remember it.
[07:33.26]It was right here.
[07:34.76]Wow.
[07:36.25]This is super historic.
[07:37.27]Alright, let's keep going.

[11:27.17]It led into here.
[11:28.95]And then he got like shit-faced and threw the remaining wood into the shed.
[11:33.59]I can't do this.
[11:35.11]I'm already like 80 grand in the hole.

[13:15.49]What decision do they want?
[13:16.49]Okay, make a decision.
[13:20.17]Definitely a TV.
[13:21.27]The room feels so empty without it.
[13:22.79]We can also add some decorations.
[13:24.13]A carpet and a few potted plants.
[13:26.92]A fireplace could make this room feel more complete.
[13:30.44]Large corner electric fireplace.
[13:32.34]No, no, no, no.
[13:33.26]I don't care.
[13:33.62]I'm not doing an electric fireplace.
[13:35.06]No way.
[13:35.32]I don't even care what the other one is.
[13:40.00]I'm sorry, guys.
[13:40.54]Something about flicking a switch and fire starts in my house.
[13:43.18]I don't want that.
[13:43.88]That's dangerous to me.
[13:47.53]You don't flick a switch and your oven goes to 500 degrees.
[13:50.73]Nope.
[13:52.29]I wouldn't want that either.
[13:55.67]Alright, let's clean.
[13:59.27]Easy.
[14:00.85]Yes, you would.
[14:01.27]I would not want that.
[14:02.05]That's terrifying.
[14:04.69]Who wants an oven that if you hit the on button is instantly 500 degrees?
[14:10.75]That's terrifying.
[14:11.77]Alright, hold on.

[14:20.91]Let's get rid of this fucking thing.

[14:25.46]Remove object.
[14:26.54]Oh.

[15:45.67]Okay, here we go.
[15:47.81]Let me shrink this a little bit.
[15:53.04]Drivelogs.
[15:54.46]Ah, a fake website.
[15:56.80]What is that website?
[15:57.80]I don't want that website.
[15:58.74]I don't want my vlogs.
[16:01.58]And don't know what to delete.
[16:02.72]That's a good one.
[16:03.54]What if you just tell the truth?
[16:05.10]Yeah, I mean, that's true.
[16:06.26]Play disc skipping noises.
[16:08.70]Say I dropped it down the stairs.
[16:10.84]Floppy disc sounds.
[16:11.90]Ha ha ha, that's so stupid.
[16:14.30]Yeah, say you heard it.
[16:15.68]I showed it off on Periscope.
[16:17.72]R, no shit.
[16:18.68]Okay, hold on.
[16:21.02]This is like, next level faking people's- their saying.
[16:25.56]I'm gonna record myself, I'm gonna play House Flipper, yeah.

[16:40.94]With the fake website, the fake fucking text, the fake everything, fake text.
[16:47.40]Inspect element, yeah, it was fake.
[16:51.77]I don't even need to inspect element.
[16:54.59]I got fucking online x-ray vision.
[16:58.65]Just wait till they make that shit.
[17:02.19]Just wait till you're going to have to have online x-ray vision.
[17:04.95]It's a button, like an extension you're going to have to play to see if the website's even fucking real.
[17:08.89]We're getting real fucked up in 10 years.
[17:12.57]It's a nice bathtub.
[17:19.79]Link spam.
[17:20.39]Funny link.
[17:21.11]Nah, whatever.
[17:22.38]Alright, let me... I got a living room.

[17:26.90]Why do I need $6,500?
[17:27.86]Okay, where's this wardrobe?
[17:30.48]Is this a wardrobe?
[17:31.36]What is this?
[17:33.10]This is a wardrobe, right?
[17:34.98]Well, it's ugly.
[17:35.64]Get rid of it.
[17:36.24]No, wait.
[17:37.58]Wardrobe?
[17:39.73]Alright, there we go.
[17:40.85]Clean the windows.
[17:41.67]Oh, this is my favorite part of this game.
[17:43.05]I fucking love this.
[17:52.48]Mm-hmm.
[17:55.28]It just does it for me.
[18:00.20]Oh, yeah.
[18:02.30]That was real.
[18:02.93]What the fuck?
[18:03.49]It's 100% real.
[18:04.43]You're a liar.
[18:14.23]Ask me if I'm a liar again.
[18:15.45]Say, did you lie about the clip?
[18:25.63]What's the question?
[18:29.83]Did I lie about the clip?
[18:32.33]Well, the thing is, we have to take care of everybody.
[18:35.67]We have to make sure that we get down with our hands dirty and we get everybody on the right page.
[18:42.21]I also think that we can make it happen as long as you stick with me.
[18:49.17]There you go.
[18:49.51]Here's your answer.
[18:58.38]Senator Elbertson, have you ever eaten glass for fun?
[19:03.26]Here's the thing.
[19:05.62]My favorite dog that I've ever had was little Fido.
[19:10.32]And I'll tell you, he was a good dog.
[19:12.63]I'm a good dog.
[19:14.01]And if I can be your senator again, I would be such a good boy.
[19:22.69]Senator Elbertson, is there a full shit in your underwear right fucking now?
[19:28.88]Right now, yes or no?
[19:31.94]You know, the tricky thing about trying to fix this country is just, my goodness, we got to get everybody back to work.
[19:44.55]I will yield the rest of my time.
[19:59.76]He has my vote.
[20:02.88]You can't yield time in an interview.
[20:05.57]Yes, you can.
[20:06.65]It's called, I'm just gonna stop talking and stare at the camera until they ask another question.
[20:13.61]Turn that off.
[20:14.15]I hate ovens.
[20:21.20]You get interviewed and you say I'm doing the Fifth Amendment?
[20:27.46]Mr. Elbertson, I just want to ask about a potential controversy where you chugged an entire Gatorade as fast as you could on camera for a bunch of people and you thought it was like funny and then you like burped really loud.
[20:59.14]Mr. Elbertson, what can you tell me about school?
[21:01.88]Well, the thing about school, we've got to really get in there and we've got to change everything about it.
[21:06.06]We've got to reform our schools.
[21:07.20]We've got to make sure everyone's prepared.
[21:10.68]Absolutely.

[22:02.00]You want the TV over here?
[22:06.22]Uh, wait, next to the... People are gonna be like walking in the way and shit.

[22:17.52]Okay, well, let's put the TV in the shitty place they want it.
[22:21.20]Clean this... Wait, there's one more window I didn't clean.
[22:24.10]I forgot one window.
[22:25.06]I forgot.
[22:27.99]Where is it?
[22:33.51]It's got ADHD.
[22:34.67]Yeah.
[22:37.19]Ah, shit!
[22:38.79]Fuck, I actually answered the question!
[22:41.31]No, I was supposed to tell you how we were gonna fix our schools!
[22:44.66]Shit.
[22:45.78]Oh well.
[22:56.49]Place object.
[22:57.27]Alright, what do we got?
[22:58.21]TV.

[23:00.49]Buy many.
[23:01.33]$700?
[23:01.35]How big is this thing?
[23:06.97]This is 700 bucks?
[23:12.86]Okay, well... We'll figure it out later.
[23:17.46]What a terrible setup.
[23:20.59]Now, I know this setup.
[23:21.85]I know this exact setup.
[23:22.87]This is... I just moved into a new place, and two months later, still kind of don't give a shit about this.
[23:31.35]And it's a pain in the ass, but I'm gonna do it.
[23:33.35]I don't even care.
[23:35.35]Yeah, eventually I'll get something to put that on.
[23:37.33]But, like, I don't care.
[23:39.13]I will, maybe.
[23:40.84]Thanks for being with us.
[23:45.20]That's a pretty cool, like, streamer end card.
[23:53.38]Okay, so now I need a TV corner cabinet.
[23:57.26]Is that what this is?
[23:59.00]Okay, what color?
[23:59.60]Alright, how about just bright red?
[24:06.94]Wait.
[24:13.53]That would be infuriating.
[24:16.21]Okay, imagine buying this, and this is the place that you really thought it was going to be, and your heart was set on this.
[24:22.03]And now you go, No!
[24:25.24]I didn't measure it right!
[24:26.46]Fuck, but it has to stay.
[24:30.02]I'll have to deal with it.
[24:31.98]I'll deal with it.
[24:32.50]I'll just deal with it.
[24:34.83]You hate it every day.
[24:36.39]But you know what?
[24:36.83]You're going to buy a new one, return it, have the guys that brought this thing in, you're going to have them bring it out?
[24:41.16]No, you have to deal with it.
[24:44.46]God, moving sucks.
[24:51.42]So does this, by the way.
[24:53.22]This sucks.
[24:56.96]What is it?
[25:00.83]Who can watch this?
[25:02.13]You have to be sitting here.
[25:05.44]Wait, no, I get it.
[25:06.32]Okay, so, wait, never mind.
[25:07.40]I thought this was a bathroom.
[25:08.24]I was gonna say that makes sense.
[25:12.00]It's fine?
[25:14.54]This is not fine.
[25:17.45]Why would you sit at a viewing angle permanently at, like, 30, 40 degrees?
[25:21.11]This is not fine.
[25:23.55]You have to sit here and, like, watch the TV?
[25:25.51]No, you need to be facing, forward facing.
[25:30.35]Alright.
[25:31.31]Adam Chandelier.
[25:43.23]You want two of these.
[25:43.95]This is like... You can't even... I can't even... whatever.
[26:01.84]Alright, what do you want this?
[26:04.70]A rectangular carpet.
[26:05.84]Let's do grey.
[26:06.52]Grey goes with everything.
[26:13.88]I don't like how this is set up.
[26:15.05]How are you supposed to sit here and eat dinner?
[26:24.39]You can't, like, sit there and eat dinner on this.
[26:27.94]How do you only work in grayscale?
[26:32.34]You design... This is a living room.
[26:35.24]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:36.34]I'm sorry.
[26:37.08]I am going to tell you guys the age of sitting at the dining table is over.
[26:42.96]Us, the younger generation, that shit's over.
[26:47.36]The new dinner table is the coffee table in front of the TV.
[26:51.76]Dinner table for what?
[26:53.50]To throw all your mail?
[26:56.30]To like stack a bunch of shit and then you get pissed off in six months when there's shit all over the table?
[27:02.86]Dining room table is just totally like 2010 and before.
[27:07.04]This is the new dinner table.
[27:10.32]Everybody gets out, sits on the table, on the couch.
[27:12.54]Everyone's just eating off the couch.
[27:14.08]Everyone's like, yeah, put it on!
[27:15.28]Put Spongebob on!
[27:16.26]It's like, oh, yeah, I love it.
[27:18.52]I watch you.
[27:18.88]Do you know what I watch?
[27:19.74]I watch... Am I weird?
[27:21.00]Let me ask you this.
[27:23.07]So there's this YouTube channel.
[27:25.51]It's called The Wolf Pit.
[27:27.67]And the guy reviews, like, frozen, like, $1 dinners and TV dinners and stuff.
[27:33.69]And I watch this guy when I eat food.
[27:39.11]He's, like, going over how, like, disgusting it is.
[27:40.97]And, like, oh, this is, like, a $1 TV dinner I got from, like, the dollar store or something.
[27:44.45]And I'm just eating food going, oh, cool.
[27:45.99]Am I weird?
[27:48.54]Does that make me a weird person?
[27:55.58]Yes.
[27:57.16]It doesn't matter what I'm eating.
[27:57.96]I could be eating, like, McDonald's or I could be eating, like, a steak.
[28:02.20]It doesn't matter what it is.
[28:02.82]I'm going to watch this channel.
[28:07.25]Alright, we need two of those?
[28:08.07]Why would you want... Oh, underneath the table.
[28:10.17]That's never gonna get used.
[28:15.83]And then a Zamiya?
[28:19.01]What's a plant?
[28:19.71]Okay, I want... Buy many.
[28:23.99]Dude, alright.
[28:25.11]Can I tell you something about big plants?
[28:26.73]I'm really telling you something about stuff today, huh?
[28:28.93]Let me tell you something about X. I think these just get in the way.
[28:37.26]They look cool, I guess, but I feel like they just get in the way.
[28:41.04]Where am I?
[28:41.26]Where do I put this?
[28:41.90]What's this?
[28:45.07]This is just clearly just in the way.
[28:46.61]Something's going to be on this table, and you're going to bump into this once, and it's going to infuriate you.
[28:53.79]What do you do with this?
[28:57.33]It's a Seinfeld joke.
[28:59.03]Whatever.
[29:04.37]Hey, Seinfeld is a legendary show, alright?
[29:08.09]That doesn't bother me.
[29:09.01]Alright, living room.

[29:26.30]Look, we're trying to make a little bit more.
[29:27.82]Make the bed.
[29:30.22]Shouldn't have even done that.
[29:33.73]Who makes beds?
[29:38.25]My pillows are just on the ground every single night.
[29:40.70]And I just pick them back up and go back and go to bed.
[29:45.30]Yeah, you're a slob.
[29:46.06]Yeah, yeah, whatever.
[29:49.50]Wasn't there one down here?
[29:50.22]Okay, make a decision.
[29:54.02]Sauna and a bathroom.
[29:55.46]Being able to hop in the sauna.
[29:56.90]Wait, you can make a sauna?
[29:59.10]Just cleaning it up will suffice.
[30:00.38]This is a very capable storage room.
[30:04.23]Isn't the sauna expensive?
[30:05.45]How much is a sauna?
[30:08.23]Are you sure?
[30:08.95]Why am I getting who wants to be a millionaire?
[30:10.93]This is too much money.
[30:20.54]Why would you want a sauna down here?
[30:22.02]That's actually weird.
[30:24.62]Isn't that strange?
[30:25.42]What does this guy do down here?
[30:37.80]Oh, I gotta clean.
[30:38.38]Hey, AnonymousGifter, thanks for the five subs.

[30:58.41]Yeah, I can.
[30:58.89]What am I doing?
[30:59.93]Can't sell trash, though.
[31:02.86]You can now finish incomplete jobs.
[31:05.33]Oh, I'm gonna finish it.
[31:05.95]Wait.
[31:07.15]They ordered a sauna and I can just leave?
[31:11.25]Yeah, and I think down here I want it to be red.
[31:12.95]And I think over here the wall should be gray.
[31:15.65]Put a couple of carpets down.
[31:16.43]We want a sauna down here.
[31:17.51]Okay.
[31:18.01]I just leave and I never come back.

[33:07.26]That's my opinion on rhinos.
[33:08.44]They're very dangerous.
[33:09.34]They're very cool though.
[33:10.68]They can go very fast.
[33:14.46]Oh, I like the gray bubble tiles.
[33:16.06]What do you guys think?

[42:45.44]You broke the shower.
[42:48.94]Oh, because it's... Why?
[42:50.08]Because it's hovering.
[42:55.00]It's like a foot off the ground.

[43:44.50]I'm losing money.
[43:46.16]Alright, I'm done.
[43:50.00]I'm gonna leave.
[43:50.56]I gotta go.
[43:52.32]That was fun to make the sauna.
[43:53.72]Cool.
[43:54.96]Nice.
[43:56.49]Goodbye.
[44:03.03]Wait, photographing?
[44:05.45]Wait, it's doing before and after photos.
[44:12.12]Oh, wow.
[44:13.56]Nothing.
[44:17.20]You didn't change shit.
[44:20.54]That's not- All it is- Okay, I hired a cleaning company.
[44:24.28]Let's take a look at your new house!
[44:27.28]A cleaning company came and picked up the wood!
[44:37.71]You've ruined a room and left.
[44:39.89]And I made $7,300 doing it.
[44:48.08]Bathing suits are not allowed in Saunas.
[44:49.82]New house unlocked.
[44:50.70]Okay, cool.
[44:52.80]How much money do I have?
[44:55.14]I have like $300,000.
[44:55.92]Alright, alright.
[44:58.72]Getting interesting here.
[44:59.54]We have this one with this one.
[45:04.11]Check out this one.
[45:05.79]Man's job.
[45:08.12]Okay.
[45:08.32]What about this one?
[45:11.86]Hundred-year-old memories.
[45:13.67]This house is over a hundred years old, and the ubiquitous mood gives it a unique appeal.
[45:19.06]It'd be great for Trevor and Lily and their kids.
[45:21.44]A family of sailors.
[45:24.96]It's going to be haunted.
[45:25.74]The family fell in love with the house at first sight.
[45:29.86]It was not cheap, so the budget for its renovation is limited.
[45:32.81]It should be just enough to have it refreshed and to introduce some necessary changes.
[45:37.03]I hired the wrong guy.
[45:39.16]Never hire an interior decorator on Craigslist, and you're about to find out why.
[45:54.06]Make The Simpsons house.
[45:56.22]No.
[45:59.04]Alright, clean the dirt.
[46:03.40]My favorite part.
[46:13.26]Weeds?
[46:16.08]He hates The Simpsons.
[46:19.37]Yeah, I think I probably do now.
[46:21.29]When was the last time you watched it?
[46:22.89]I haven't watched it.
[46:24.63]Maybe not hate them.
[46:25.31]I don't hate The Simpsons, but I don't... I haven't watched an episode in probably 15 years.
[46:30.72]I don't know.
[46:31.30]Does he hate it?
[46:32.30]No.
[46:32.52]He doesn't watch it.
[46:36.42]I don't even think I can name you the whole family right now if I tried.
[46:39.28]Bart, Lisa, Santa's helper, Homer, Marge,
[46:48.46]And Margaret.
[46:49.80]I stick into it.
[46:50.92]I got it.
[46:54.03]This place is a mess.
[46:59.35]Let's remove the fluorescent lights and the mirror from above the sink.
[47:02.65]We can lay elegant wall tiles and mount a new mirror.
[47:05.78]This mirror fits and looks like a window.
[47:07.34]Let's keep it.
[47:08.04]We will just buy a few.
[47:09.02]Yeah.
[47:09.86]I like the weird one.
[47:12.80]I like the weird while you're at the kitchen sink stare at a huge mirror.
[47:22.23]place is filthy.
[47:23.33]What do you mean that's wrong?
[47:29.13]What do you think Maggie is short for?
[47:33.83]Yeah.
[47:34.73]Margaret.
[47:36.03]Maggie.
[47:44.04]Do you guys not know?
[47:44.82]You don't.
[47:47.78]Pepe face.
[47:55.33]Where's all this dirt?
[47:56.05]Oh, up here.
[48:02.56]Alright, what if... Okay.
[48:06.48]We gotta go... Hold on to this one.
[48:08.30]The next house that's really, really full of trash and dirt and shit... I wanna try to put it all in the same room.
[48:17.81]So when they do the before and after picture, it's even worse.
[48:20.33]This one's on the outside.
[48:23.07]Okay.
[48:25.40]Why am I trying to climb?
[48:26.52]Wait, that's not... Why do you have little, like, escape doors?
[48:37.06]This is, that's awful.
[48:38.25]These, you can't, these don't even open?
[48:43.81]This is not, doesn't go to the backyard?
[48:48.37]What on Earth?
[48:52.52]Oh, the front yard?
[48:53.38]Wait, that's the front yard.
[48:58.43]I'm not a fan.
[49:01.07]You don't have to pay me.
[49:01.89]I'll change those out for you.
[49:06.01]These are French doors.
[49:08.01]No, they're not.
[49:09.89]Are these French windows?
[49:18.74]Is this the last bug?
[49:20.24]It's not on the roof, isn't it?
[49:25.97]That's a Jerma door.
[49:30.19]Sure, okay, that's fine.
[49:32.95]It could also be an elegant doggy door.
[49:37.59]Where's this thing?
[49:40.52]Do you see this?
[49:41.58]I can't see this.
[49:46.14]Where is this?
[49:51.58]Whatever, you get fucking rats in the wall for all, it doesn't matter.
[49:55.77]On the grass?
[49:56.55]Up top.
[49:57.03]I can't reach that far.
[49:57.93]Irma, you made me forget I was making mac and cheese.
[50:06.64]Um... That's... What, did you kind of leave it on the... It just gets better with age.
[50:17.63]All you guys that talk all this shit about like, ah, I fucking hate making mac and cheese.
[50:21.25]Every time I make it, it's so runny.
[50:23.59]What's going on here?
[50:24.95]Wait.
[50:25.15]You're not waiting long enough.
[50:27.11]You're not patient.
[50:28.93]And you're trying to eat it before it's ready.
[50:35.58]You let it sit there.
[50:37.42]Ster it up.
[50:38.68]And it'll absorb all the nutrients.
[50:40.98]It'll absorb everything.
[50:41.96]It'll puff up.
[50:42.56]It'll be thick and greasy and shit.
[50:44.94]You need to wait.
[50:45.40]You're not waiting long enough.
[50:51.18]There's mud all over the bed.
[50:53.26]I found Santa's helper's room.
[50:59.53]This is just if a dog had his own bedroom.
[51:08.67]Alright, what do you want me to do in here?
[51:10.51]Clean dirt.
[51:10.89]99%.
[51:10.92]Great.
[51:11.62]That's fantastic.
[51:12.62]Where is it?
[51:15.42]I got it.
[51:16.68]Nothing in here, right?
[51:25.09]Just dirt?
[51:33.34]Shit, I had something to tell you guys today.
[51:37.14]What was it?
[51:39.60]What the hell did I have to tell you guys?
[51:41.18]I had something going on.
[51:42.34]I had something to say.
[51:43.06]I had something.
[51:47.25]I remember, like, just, like, shaking my hands, like, rubbing my hands, going, like, I can't wait to tell them this one.
[51:52.81]Don't know what it was.
[51:56.29]Damn, I guess we'll never know.
[51:57.42]I don't like a lot of big orange bed sheets.
[52:10.20]Orange, no.
[52:13.39]What's the thing about colors?
[52:17.41]Orange, I don't like this.
[52:21.57]I mean, you remove the two pillows.
[52:25.83]Never mind.
[52:26.19]I was going to say it'll be a giant creamsicle and I like those, but that's not even like... Who cares?
[52:30.61]That's not even funny.
[52:38.45]Nonsense words.
[52:40.19]Quick, just say words.
[52:41.31]Quick.
[52:41.63]I mean, what should happen with our schools?
[52:46.20]Okay.
[52:47.28]Dark mahogany floor panel.
[52:49.66]In here.
[52:52.60]Oh, thank God it's right here for me.
[52:54.42]It's foolproof.
[52:58.45]It's a prison jumpsuit bed.
[53:08.60]Words, words, words, words, words.
[53:10.60]Why does everybody love- What's the obsession with wood?
[53:25.18]When I see, like, a nice carpet, I'm like, oh, I like that.
[53:27.68]It's soft.
[53:28.24]It stays warm.
[53:30.21]Your feet aren't cold.
[53:32.55]Everybody... I don't know what it is.
[53:33.63]Everybody loves wood.
[53:38.29]I don't.
[53:38.93]When you step on wood, you... When you walk around a house that was predominantly wood, I've lived in one.
[53:46.01]It's... It's just... In every room.
[53:51.94]I don't... It's like I'm playing basketball in my house.
[53:56.53]You'll step on a piece of that, a panel somewhere, and you'll hear a... Like, a hundred feet somewhere else in another room.
[54:12.66]Everybody could always track where you, where you are.
[54:16.19]In a wooden, like a wood floors.
[54:18.53]Like, I know exactly where the fuck you're stepping.
[54:26.41]I don't want to know that information.
[54:27.64]I don't want to know how many times you've gone into the bathroom.
[54:35.57]It's easy to clean.
[54:38.17]Yeah, but I know, but then you obsess over it.
[54:41.88]It's really nice.
[54:43.26]Wood is expensive.
[54:44.18]Real wood, wooden floors are expensive.
[54:46.40]So anytime that you drop anything or touch a piece of grease, a small crumb lands on the floor, you grab it, you're like, fuck!
[54:53.52]And then you lick your finger.
[54:54.86]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[54:55.78]God, please.
[54:56.58]Just give me a multicolored shitty carpet that I can just dump shit on.
[55:02.56]It doesn't even matter and just run a vacuum over it once a year.
[55:10.78]How many stains are on that carpet?
[55:12.02]You'll never know.
[55:13.40]There could be a hundred.
[55:14.64]Hidden in the fucking awesome carpeted, multi-fiber colored, just like in there.
[55:19.24]You can't even tell.
[55:22.28]I could probably do a full piss onto some of these carpets and have you guys come in and examine it and be like, wow, this is perfectly fine.
[55:32.21]By the way, every day.
[55:33.05]I could probably piss on it every fucking day for a year.
[55:35.69]And you would come in and you would have no idea where it was.
[55:40.12]smell no it wouldn't I would bring in somebody in a room hey what do you what do you think about this room it's like it stinks like piss in here what's this guy trying to get me to do hey come on in here can you hey can you see if you can find it the piss because that's all I smell okay Melissa light colored the left corner sofa that's a long one
[56:13.03]Mimimo dark coffee table.
[56:15.35]Where does it want this?
[56:16.49]Not here.
[56:16.83]Oh, no, they did want a Mimimo dark coffee.
[56:21.21]Here, here we go.
[56:27.04]I wish I had a couch like this.
[56:30.02]It's just a permanent bed.
[56:32.40]No matter what.
[56:33.16]You could just lie on it.
[56:34.34]Where is it supposed to go?
[56:42.80]This is... This is why having windows this big sucks.
[56:53.12]Honestly, this is horrible.
[56:55.50]You ever want to clean these... These windows just never open.
[56:58.16]You have to accept that.
[56:59.30]If you put one of these here, you put a couch next to a window like that, you have to accept that it'll never be fucking opened once.
[57:05.78]Ever.
[57:06.70]For any reason.
[57:09.43]And you just hope to God that one day, like, four years from now, when you open this, like, the dead bugs and rotten leaves that are in here are not enough to make you throw up out the window.
[57:20.14]Because then your neighbor will think you're crazy.
[57:23.34]Why did he just do that?
[57:24.08]He opened up his window and puked.
[57:29.10]He has a bathroom, doesn't he?
[57:30.18]Like, just puke in the bathroom?
[57:31.86]It takes longer to open the window.
[57:36.94]Okay, coffee table.
[57:38.46]I'm gonna move this shit around.
[57:39.38]I don't like this at all.
[57:40.39]I hate this.
[57:44.31]No TV in here.
[57:45.31]Fireplace.
[57:45.93]No, I don't like this.
[57:47.37]I hate this house.
[57:49.55]Then you have the weird separate, like, fucking dungeon dining room.
[57:53.25]No, I don't like that.
[57:54.11]I hate that.
[57:55.01]Get this wall out of here.
[57:56.59]And get rid of the half of this room.
[57:58.06]Just remove this.
[58:03.04]Different floor.
[58:04.40]No.
[58:04.74]Ugh.
[58:06.65]This is what happens when your house is too big.
[58:07.97]Because this is all the furniture that anybody fucking needs in their whole life.
[58:15.05]So then you end up with like, if you have like a 4,000 square foot house, it's like, okay, we have the biggest couch we could possibly fucking find.
[58:23.08]Nice.
[58:23.40]That's all we need.
[58:27.28]Uh, I guess fill it with plants.
[58:35.77]You don't have a TV right there.
[58:36.89]That's unbelievable.
[58:38.55]Alright, place object.
[58:39.65]Alright, here it is.
[58:42.17]Told you.
[58:42.45]Okay, good.
[58:46.95]Put it up here.
[58:48.87]Right here.
[58:49.21]How about that?
[58:49.63]Yeah, that looks good.
[58:52.11]How many more of these do we want?
[58:53.42]This is a big one.
[58:54.14]It's big enough for me to get in the way and smell and get in and rot.
[58:58.90]Because I don't take care of it.
[59:04.42]Unless they're fake.
[59:09.36]It's just unnecessary shit.
[59:14.12]Does it look nice?
[59:15.28]I guess, but it's just, it's unnecessary shit.
[59:24.89]Irma hates plants.
[59:27.65]No, I love plants.
[59:29.69]I love a garden.
[59:31.27]I love tending to tomatoes.
[59:32.92]I love growing my own tomatoes and eating them.

[60:26.15]Oh, okay.
[60:26.59]I read it on stream, I guess.
[60:34.11]How did you get halogen lamps?

[60:41.45]Prove it.
[60:42.11]Eat a book on stream.

[62:14.52]Maybe it did.
[62:15.42]Maybe it did.

[62:17.84]You can cause a fire.
[62:26.99]Yeah, but it's not, okay, it could cause a fire, sure.
[62:30.58]And then the fire will take a little while to spread.
[62:32.72]At least 50 to 60 seconds, right?

[65:28.25]I'm gonna die in five seconds!
[65:32.85]Why would you wake up to that?
[65:34.31]Why would you ever want to rip your fucking head up from bed?
[65:37.09]You're supposed to wake up easily.
[65:40.21]Slowly.
[65:42.41]Why do people use that for their alarm?
[65:46.33]That sound only means three or four different things.
[65:50.69]Look out, there is a fucking tornado.
[65:53.11]A bomb is gonna drop on you.
[65:55.45]You are under attack, or there is an immediate threat that is around you.

[66:06.43]Like, oh hey, it's a spy moving.
[66:08.69]You stepped on the red wire thing, and now machine guns are gonna shoot at you.

[66:24.58]It's got 50.
[66:25.02]Okay, I haven't done anything.

[66:32.21]Fade that guy for five seconds.
[66:39.01]Somebody, yeah, Flugboy gave 50 bucks.
[66:41.49]Thanks, Flugboy, for the huge, absurd amount of money.
[66:47.97]Thank you.
[66:48.55]That's a lot of money.
[66:51.49]There's no message or anything, but I... You guys know I don't read bit messages anymore.
[66:55.82]But that's still an insane thing to do.
[67:03.02]Red spy is in the base.
[67:12.49]Prove it.
[67:12.95]Wake up to birds right now.
[67:14.87]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[67:18.16]Okay, what do I have to do?
[67:19.31]Turn on.
[67:22.57]Maybe a fuse is blown.
[67:25.87]What else is left?
[67:28.51]Paint the color silver glacier in the bedroom.
[67:31.56]Bedroom 11.
[67:32.04]Okay, bedroom 11.
[67:40.42]Paint.
[67:42.53]Yes!
[67:43.85]My favorite part.
[67:48.20]Oh, it feels... I love that part when it sucks it all up.
[67:50.73]This is the wrong bedroom.
[68:02.70]This is 11-2, right?
[68:04.30]11... This is another wrong... What do you mean?
[68:17.91]How many bedrooms do they have here?
[68:21.70]Is this on the first floor?
[68:22.96]That's what I'm talking about.
[68:26.50]You have too much stuff.
[68:28.32]You get lost in your own house.
[68:30.86]No.
[68:31.22]All you need is a toilet, an electric stove, and a bed.
[68:39.71]You don't need all this room.
[68:41.17]It's just room for the gas.
[68:44.17]Okay.
[68:44.29]Here we go.
[68:49.74]Get rid of this thing.
[68:58.44]There we are.
[68:59.84]I just thought somebody gave $50.
[69:02.32]That was the someone gave $50 noise.
[69:12.51]It's so relaxing.
[69:14.51]I'm so glad that I promised to play this today.
[69:17.83]Ugh.
[69:19.52]You know what I mean?
[69:20.98]Gotta just keep your word.
[69:22.18]That's my slogan.
[69:26.42]Keep your word.
[69:30.81]There's been a huge scandal about how I've lied about everything.
[69:35.51]My entire campaign was running on telling the truth and nothing I said was real.
[69:51.04]Dean Dingus.
[69:51.94]He can't get away with this.
[69:57.34]Senator Elbertson.
[69:58.52]Keep your word.
[70:01.40]And then they play during the attack ad campaigns against me.
[70:07.33]They show how I opened up a guy's house.
[70:12.33]Went in.
[70:12.63]Told him I was going to put a sauna in.
[70:16.61]And then just fucking left and lied and told him I wasn't going to do it anymore.
[70:23.34]Did people paint their closets?
[70:32.88]No?
[70:33.04]I mean, I thought they did.
[70:35.34]Thank you, Peter Gr... I thought it was Peter Griffin.
[70:37.08]Thank you, Peter V... Peter Gruen.
[70:40.90]For the 10 community subs, actually.
[70:46.08]Thanks for the 10 subs.
[70:47.74]Welcome all the new subs.
[70:50.52]Hey, what's going on, new subs?
[70:59.36]Wait, what's in the safe?
[71:01.55]Forgotten safe in the closet.
[71:03.01]This must be the forgotten safe of the captain that lived here a hundred years ago.
[71:09.35]After selling the precious notes and jewelry found inside the budget significantly increased.
[71:14.96]This allows us to plan something more for both the kitchen and the bathroom.
[71:20.76]I'm on TV right now.
[71:23.60]I'm on TV.
[71:26.08]I'm about to go on like a weird prank show adventure.
[71:31.37]How did you not see this?
[71:33.13]This is like... It's a giant fucking open safe here.
[71:37.37]Why would you not see this?
[71:39.34]Steal the money.
[71:39.86]I already... I just did.
[71:40.58]I just did.
[71:51.06]Wait.
[71:52.17]Okay, close this.
[71:53.85]Paint is done.
[71:54.49]We can sell this now.
[71:56.83]Alright, we need a bedside table.
[72:01.51]Well, can I give you some more design choices here?
[72:03.53]Because that is an ugly ass bed.
[72:11.66]There.
[72:12.22]There we go.
[72:13.18]Make sure you give me a good review on Yelp.
[72:15.08]Jerma985.
[72:15.82]It's my Jerma985 colors.
[72:25.76]How's this going to fit in here?
[72:32.52]This room sucks.
[72:33.94]How is this supposed to fit in here?
[72:35.26]Why would you want a bed like this?
[72:41.69]Okay, bedside table.
[72:42.81]The bed doesn't fit.
[72:43.63]Is this supposed to be an end table?
[72:59.08]This bed only can fit one way.
[73:03.87]And it blocks every door.
[73:08.71]And we need a lamp.
[73:09.97]Make sure you get those germa985 colors.
[73:20.50]Was this a carpet?
[73:22.42]Get that germa985 set green.
[73:32.98]Alright, the carpet is there for all the shit that goes under your bed.
[73:36.90]It's a useless carpet.
[73:39.10]And they want a painting.
[73:40.08]A big one.
[73:46.55]Okay, does anybody feel like... Okay, if this was next to your bed and you were sleeping... And you're snoring your life away, you know, you're just sleeping.
[73:56.09]And you turn when you wake up and your eyes are pointing this way and you see this...
[74:01.16]I feel like sometimes I would actually think I was sleeping on a beach for a second.
[74:06.44]It would be terrifying.
[74:13.97]Okay, this one's done.
[74:26.42]What's next?
[74:26.96]Ooh, a choice!
[74:30.03]A cupboard shelf and new tiles will be enough.
[74:32.43]We will utilize the extra budget.
[74:34.31]Let's go crazy and add a second sink.
[74:41.77]I want to save the money that I stole.
[74:44.19]I'm going to invest that shit.
[74:46.95]Okay, modify the walls, wall tiles.
[74:55.31]Oh yeah, that's right.
[74:55.91]You have to actually pick these up.
[75:04.86]Okay, I can finish the job now.
[75:08.22]Do we care?
[75:08.82]I don't think we care.
[75:19.15]No, this is just to make money so I can buy my own house.
[75:21.49]It's coming up here in a minute.
[75:22.45]Yeah, I'm done.
[75:26.95]Wait, first I want to fuck the whole shit up.
[75:28.64]Hold on.
[75:54.98]I'm gonna put the dining room table in here too.
[76:06.73]Turn the oven on.
[76:07.83]No, I'll put the oven in there.
[76:09.45]That's much better in there.
[76:13.67]And when you're watching the game, you're gonna have a nice fucking crisp pizza ready.
[76:19.51]Fuck, okay.
[76:20.47]I gotta think about what I want.
[76:40.11]Okay, done.
[76:41.49]I've prepared you for your yard sale.
[76:45.13]Complete the job.
[76:47.45]You may not complete the job, but I got tons of money.
[76:50.10]I don't care about the money.
[76:51.02]I just care about making a statement.
[76:52.76]Yeah.
[77:01.73]All you did was remove my things.
[77:05.13]Still trash.
[77:17.22]You know what the best part about that was?
[77:19.62]This is how all this bullshit, all the fake filters and stuff, that was just a filter on the shitty picture.
[77:28.91]They took a shitty picture and they put a little filter on it to make it look better.
[77:32.19]It doesn't look like that.
[77:32.99]I didn't walk in that room.
[77:36.61]They tried so hard to make how bad that was look not as bad, even though it's just a raw photo.
[77:45.63]I got $341,000.
[77:46.01]I'm ready.
[77:47.31]We need a big one.
[77:59.08]Um.
[78:00.48]There's an actual Simpsons house in the game.
[78:08.34]How do I do that one?
[78:15.48]I don't know if you can buy the house in the HDTV part.
[78:19.20]Oh.
[78:21.58]Alright, property renovation in the rental business.
[78:23.16]She's expecting a baby, so there's no way she can work as much as usually.
[78:25.90]I'm going to have to help her with a house for one of her clients.
[78:29.18]It's a semi-detached house that requires some work and... Yeah, okay.
[78:32.82]I got a $9,000 budget.
[78:36.09]You're in story mode.
[78:39.29]Yeah, I got to unlock all the tools, and then I'm going to take those tools into free purchase mode.
[78:46.88]Alright, so what does she want?
[78:48.62]First of all, this has got to change.
[78:51.82]That's the first... You really need an HGTV specialist to tell you that this is probably not something to have.
[78:58.53]This is probably like a... You want a more neutral color?
[79:01.01]Well, now we've got a clean slate to work with.
[79:05.61]Alright.
[79:10.22]Here's an idea.
[79:10.66]Maybe we should demolish the two walls and knock it down.
[79:13.94]Knock it down.
[79:14.74]Knock the whole thing down.
[79:16.83]The whole thing should be an open floor plan, including the bathrooms.
[79:20.50]Knock it down.
[79:25.96]I'm talking square build tool in The Sims.
[79:31.01]No rooms made.
[79:32.09]This is just as satisfying as it was before.
[79:48.81]Alright, well I have the sledgehammer.
[79:56.04]Feels good.
[79:56.50]Feels good.
[79:57.96]It's been a while.
[80:05.75]It's excessively loud.
[80:06.81]Yep, the game is excessively loud.
[80:11.69]Someone has started working on the kitchen already, gone with a dark brown paint.
[80:16.63]Let's add some traditional hanging lamps.
[80:18.17]No, I hate those.
[80:21.21]Let's put some bright colors on the walls.
[80:22.97]Yes.
[80:25.29]Absolutely.
[80:35.95]Lime green.
[80:40.54]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[80:41.46]What do you mean, whoa?
[80:41.98]What are you doing?
[80:49.13]I'm doing my interior designing.
[80:51.37]What are you doing?
[80:54.02]Besides criticizing a genius at work.
[81:04.36]Broken pipe.
[81:05.18]It looks like the radiator.
[81:07.01]Wait, gas!
[81:08.57]No, it's water.
[81:09.15]Okay.
[81:09.77]The leak needs to be stopped.
[81:10.77]There should be a water supply valve.
[81:18.50]Is the water supply valve?
[81:37.08]I'm gonna hit the gas line.
[81:38.24]Okay, I'm actually kind of concerned about this because if I hit a gas line and it's an instant gas line like explosion, then I'm starting to have a little bit of a scenario here.
[81:49.37]I don't like this.
[81:56.71]If I can hit the water line, then I can hit the gas line.
[82:12.97]This is the load-bearing wall.
[82:18.31]Yeah, where's the load-bearing wall?
[82:21.34]There ain't no more walls.
[82:26.10]The house is just laid on top like a hat.
[82:31.52]Oh no, the house is coming down.
[82:39.75]Just delete everything?
[82:41.88]I'm gonna make an open floor.
[82:43.12]I'm gonna make a completely open Sims 4 renovation.
[82:51.63]This guy's deranged.
[83:00.06]Just renovate it as an empty field.
[83:01.92]Just take the whole house down.
[83:03.68]So the before and after is just a house and then the house is gone.
[83:14.08]Um, that's not a renovation.
[83:15.94]That's a magic trick.
[83:21.04]Imagine going through all that trouble.
[83:22.25]Okay, what we're going to do is we're going to bulldoze their fucking house.
[83:27.89]And then I'm going to pretend on TV that I made it disappear.
[83:31.07]And I'm just going to cut these people.
[83:34.17]You know what?
[83:35.31]I wonder how many times maybe that has happened before.
[83:39.19]Like, if I was, like, a just millionaire magician, I would just, like, you know, here's a check.
[83:46.90]How much is your house worth?
[83:48.96]Oh, the house is worth probably $325,000.
[83:52.32]I'll give you $400,000 if you let me do, like, a magic trick where I disappear your house.
[84:01.12]You just go buy one in cash.
[84:03.86]But I need to do this.
[84:14.77]You mean destroy it.
[84:17.99]Yeah, but it's a magic trick.
[84:19.53]I'm not like destroying the house.
[84:21.37]It's a magic trick.
[84:27.59]I haven't used the door.
[84:31.19]Is it leak?
[84:32.75]That's fine.
[84:33.99]Not my problem.
[84:37.69]Load-bearing wall.
[84:39.17]Don't touch that one.
[85:03.89]I just got an achievement for being an asshole.
[85:07.43]The achievement I just got is called Truly Open Space.
[85:14.38]See?
[85:16.90]I'm making game progress.
[85:20.22]What is this?
[85:22.22]Why is this like a puppeteer station?
[85:24.06]There's a wall here, a wall there.
[85:25.48]Is this where the family crouches down and has like puppet night?
[85:31.03]How can I sell this?
[85:37.30]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[85:37.70]If you have a dedicated puppetry room, then I guarantee you, you got five or six big plants in your house.
[85:46.93]You want to put... You want to make that bet?
[85:48.79]You want to put that money down?
[85:49.67]What are these?
[85:59.61]Cement.
[86:00.01]I thought it said gourmet.
[86:02.93]Gourmet cement.
[86:08.40]Lights on floor, lights on floor.
[86:10.10]It's alright, I'm not gonna... That's immoral.
[86:22.36]I can't sell the doors.
[86:24.20]The doors have to stay.
[86:28.08]But everything else can be smashed down with a sledgehammer.
[86:34.61]That's very immoral.
[86:38.85]Okay, that's it, right?
[86:39.87]Anymore?
[86:40.19]Move furniture into the water leak.
[86:50.35]See, at, hey, if being a psycho was a strategy game, we would get an S plus on every level.
[87:00.11]You get that, right?
[87:08.04]Okay.
[87:08.92]Is this the house?
[87:09.44]Is there any more rooms or anything?
[87:10.70]Okay.
[87:18.12]Who's we?
[87:20.80]What do you mean?
[87:21.24]I'm talking about you.
[87:24.72]Uh, it's you that I'm referring to.
[87:27.38]I'm talking about you.
[87:28.50]Alright, cool.
[87:31.26]Now we want build the walls.
[87:33.71]No.
[87:34.81]A mountable tower radiator.
[87:41.80]Toilet?
[87:42.84]Alright.
[87:49.53]Oh, shit.
[87:49.81]I need to mount this toilet.
[87:52.89]Can I just jam it in there?
[87:54.11]Just stick it into the water.
[88:00.44]Wait, lay what?
[88:01.30]Wait, wait, wait.
[88:01.74]What room am I in?
[88:04.04]I need a radiator.
[88:05.14]Towel, radiator, plumbing system.
[88:06.61]Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[88:10.17]What is a towel radiator plumbing system?
[88:13.33]What?
[88:13.55]Did I read that wrong?
[88:29.91]No, I want to get that out of the way.
[88:35.32]Wait, what is this here for?
[88:40.75]You don't even need a shower.
[88:43.17]Just come into the leaking room and just smush your face over here.
[88:47.13]It's an indoor pool.
[88:48.33]Yeah!
[88:49.23]Somebody gets it.
[88:49.93]Okay, remove object.
[88:52.97]No.
[88:58.14]Where's the toilet mount?
[89:10.56]Move the bathtub onto the leak.
[89:13.86]Can I move the bathtub?
[89:16.48]I can't.
[89:16.82]I cannot move the bathtub, unfortunately.
[89:18.75]Click on the link.
[89:20.69]What even is a toilet, really?
[89:24.19]Wow, this is your room.
[89:24.95]It's so cool.
[89:25.85]Yeah.
[89:28.05]Yep.
[89:30.80]Why do you always have to use this drunk image?
[89:35.30]I don't know where these are supposed to go.
[89:36.84]Alright, multiple...
[89:39.27]Mountable towel radiator.
[89:42.31]What is this?
[89:43.69]Old Japanese sink.
[89:45.51]Okay.
[89:48.07]There we go.
[89:48.49]Yeah, I fixed one of the leaks.
[90:10.01]Where does it go?
[90:13.75]It's crazy that that's how they make these things.
[90:17.64]Okay, cool.
[90:22.24]What's wrong with this?
[90:26.84]Assemble?
[90:29.43]It is assembled.
[90:32.53]Paint with the colors Young Flower Bud.
[90:39.10]Uh, young flower bud.
[90:40.58]Alright, here we go.
[90:41.28]This is going to be real boring, but I love it.
[90:45.74]Enable a yay yay.
[90:48.64]I'm not going to say it the way it's supposed to be said.
[90:51.39]This is baby puke yellow.
[91:06.18]I think this is baby puke, baby, this is, I think this is, yeah, this is baby, like, baby burp yellow.
[91:11.72]That's a better way to put it.
[91:22.97]Why would you, yeah, yellow?
[91:25.01]I mean, it's, I don't know, like an olive?
[91:27.75]What would you call it?
[91:32.09]This is carpet piss.
[91:35.08]Yeah, that's accurate.
[91:37.42]That is what it looks like.
[91:38.70]That's an accurate carpet piss color, you're right.
[91:44.43]How rude that would be if you told somebody that.
[91:49.15]Yeah, we had it painted.
[91:50.69]Yeah, we got a painter in here, did the bedrooms, did the living room.
[91:57.21]This looks like carpet piss yellow.
[92:00.33]Because when you hear that, you have to really think about it, because it doesn't make any sense at first.
[92:05.77]And then you think about what an old piss would look like as a big gross circle.
[92:11.79]And then you would see it and you would know.
[92:18.58]And then you get angry.
[92:21.58]It angers you.
[92:25.42]Then you pretend to like it.
[92:34.37]And then eventually you pretend to like it for so long that you're just like, yeah, it's cool.
[92:38.23]I like it.
[92:38.81]It's fine.
[92:39.21]You know what I really do miss though?
[92:44.22]I miss my spearmint green gamer room.
[92:48.88]I love that color.
[92:51.31]I want like a spearmint green room again.
[92:54.41]I love it so much.
[92:56.11]It's like my favorite color.
[92:58.70]Okay, so now we need, uh, lay wall tiles, white mosaic hexagon.
[93:09.55]Wait, it's just right here.
[93:13.04]Wait, what?
[93:21.10]Hexagon.
[93:22.78]What's it called?
[93:24.44]White mosaic hexagon, right?
[93:28.39]Alright, where is this supposed to go?
[93:29.87]Oh yeah, that's right.
[93:30.45]This is a room.
[93:34.03]Olive green is my favorite color.
[93:35.59]Wait, is this not right?
[93:37.13]What room is this going?
[93:40.35]Just testing each room.
[93:45.72]Which room is it going?
[93:51.02]Wall tiles.
[93:52.54]Shit.
[93:57.58]Hold on.
[94:00.68]Modify what?
[94:03.04]Dark gray mosaic?
[94:05.26]No, I thought it was white mosaic.
[94:20.06]Shit!
[94:20.66]No, that's not right either.
[94:21.64]Quick, draw a penis.
[94:26.58]Modify walls.

[94:36.31]Why is that not working?
[94:37.01]8 out of 10?
[94:41.47]Put this away.
[94:42.19]Throw this away.
[94:42.75]I don't want this.
[94:50.10]I have to get rid of them.
[94:56.00]It's because I demolished all the walls.
[94:59.82]I actually kind of like that.
[95:04.47]That gives off the, like, in the pool.
[95:07.13]That's like the side of a pool.
[95:08.39]I really like that.
[95:09.81]Okay, let's go.

[95:16.34]25 of them.
[95:16.62]Good.
[95:26.45]This is a bathroom house?
[95:28.49]That's a good idea.
[95:30.82]God damn it.
[95:31.44]Am I gonna get, like, addicted to House Slipper again?
[95:33.50]I think I might.
[95:35.34]I don't know.
[95:35.78]Are we... Are we gonna be streaming this tomorrow?
[95:39.48]Oh, no.
[95:40.42]What have you done?
[95:42.67]Why did you remind me that I promised to play this?
[95:45.09]You know what happens.
[95:47.07]I get stuck here.
[95:58.72]That's enough, right?
[95:59.34]Yeah.
[95:59.84]No, yeah.
[96:00.65]Yeah.
[96:05.59]These are the best streams.
[96:08.33]I love this game.
[96:12.67]This game is so simple and it's so basic.
[96:17.26]But it's like the best game.
[96:21.22]I love this game.
[96:24.04]This has to be my favorite game in the last five years.
[96:27.99]Isn't that fucked up?
[96:30.97]That sounds like it's something you shouldn't say out loud.
[96:41.61]What's come out in the last five years?
[96:45.43]I gotta paint some... Wait.
[96:46.89]I'm gonna paint this wall in here.

[97:03.46]What about a Half-Life game?
[97:06.20]But that's like, what do you mean?
[97:07.20]The last five years?
[97:14.44]Half-Life Alyx?
[97:18.01]I haven't played Half-Life Alyx though, so how can I compare it?
[97:26.05]This doesn't count as a wall?
[97:26.89]Okay, there we go. 73...
[97:34.15]24, 75, 76, 77.
[97:39.41]Play Half- Alyx.

[98:51.50]What are you doing?
[98:53.82]Nah, nothing.
[98:56.22]Sorry, I might sound a little hoarse.
[98:57.34]I was acting on Twitch for a while.
[99:00.54]Yeah, you play Mario Maker 2 yet, dude?
[99:03.23]Yeah, it's a wicked good acting game.

[99:42.83]I might live in Vegas now, but I was a fucking big Boston guy before I moved here.
[99:49.78]And you know what?
[99:50.74]It's still with me.
[99:51.72]Every day.
[99:59.95]This is just the drug chair.
[100:03.51]Oh, shit.
[100:07.79]I gotta just...
[100:14.67]Okay, I think I'm good.
[100:21.53]Just to stare at the wall.
[100:22.85]Okay.
[100:26.71]Ugh!
[100:46.43]Open the window.
[100:47.01]It stinks in here.
[100:51.29]What am I doing?
[100:52.77]I still have $8,000 of a budget.
[100:54.93]I'm just going to put an expensive chair in here.
[100:59.88]There's a garage too.
[101:00.92]Or what's this?
[101:01.38]A bed?
[101:01.72]Let's make it an invisible bed.
[101:29.72]I can't.
[101:30.16]I'm not going to be able to fit it.
[101:32.82]It can't go in like that.
[101:34.20]I can't.
[101:42.92]What are you, a lizard?
[101:44.32]Yeah, well, you know, I have a fucking lizard, so I have to have moisture in the bedroom at all times.
[101:53.90]My wife used to have to spray me with a bottle.
[101:57.06]This is a much better solution, I think.
[102:04.73]Alright, would you- Let me ask you again.
[102:05.91]Would you be able to do that?
[102:07.19]Would you be able to sleep like this?
[102:09.51]That's a challenge.
[102:10.45]I'm not sure I would be able to.
[102:15.60]If you were wicked tired, and the water wasn't cold, it was exactly at like 68 degrees.
[102:22.42]It was like 70 degree water.
[102:24.38]Completely isotonic.
[102:25.57]It had enough sodium.
[102:27.51]It's an isotonic solution.
[102:29.89]Would you be able to sleep with that if that was not pointed at your face?
[102:34.10]And there was like a doctor and a scientist and like a construction worker that were ready to like, hey, we got to get him out of there.
[102:43.71]Do you think you'd be able to fall asleep?
[102:46.63]No, no, not hypothermia.
[102:47.81]This is an isotonic solution.
[102:49.65]It has like the right amount of sodium, nitrogen, hydrogen, everything, human blood.
[102:55.36]It's isotonic.
[102:56.60]Look it up.
[103:07.15]Okay, that's good.
[103:09.73]Am I getting money points for this?
[103:11.59]Let me check.
[103:13.89]Look down there.
[103:15.41]Progress?
[103:18.11]I'm not.
[103:19.99]I'm not getting any progress.
[103:21.95]Okay, lay wall tiles.
[103:23.35]Wallpaper with bamboo.
[103:24.63]Where's that gonna go?
[103:26.90]Dark gray hexagon.
[103:27.98]I almost burped really loud.
[103:30.28]Dark gray hexagon mosaic.
[103:42.39]You mean credit score?
[103:44.53]Wait, what did I say?
[103:45.13]I don't remember.
[103:48.46]This is not even right.
[103:57.66]It's freecreditreport.com I'm lying down here seeing all this in this restaurant.
[104:05.21]They monitor your credit and give you free email alerts.
[104:10.32]And put it on your sweatshirt and you see the new t-shirts.
[104:16.21]Shit.
[104:17.61]Now you all heard it.
[104:19.13]It worked.
[104:20.41]Like 15 years later, it still worked.
[104:24.55]Congratulations.
[104:26.69]It still fucking worked.
[104:28.13]Good work, ad campaign team.
[104:31.54]All of you deserve to get at least a 20-30% raise.
[104:33.72]All of you.
[104:34.18]Wherever you are now.
[104:34.88]I don't care where you are.
[104:39.87]And that band.
[104:40.51]I hope they're absolutely killing it.
[104:43.30]I hope the last EP they dropped has like fucking 500 million plays on Spotify.
[104:46.58]I really hope that.
[104:47.14]Alright, now paint with the natural beige.
[105:01.47]The band broke up after the commercials?
[105:03.41]Oh, that's really sad.
[105:06.09]That makes me feel bad.
[105:08.47]Really?
[105:08.75]No.
[105:10.65]Did they?
[105:10.99]All I just read was everyone was talking about this band and then somebody just wrote, this is a fucking mess, holy shit.
[105:46.88]Okay, paint with the natural base.
[105:50.37]6%!
[105:50.41]What do you mean 6%?
[105:53.61]There's not enough walls in this house to do this.
[105:57.79]Wait, is there another house?
[106:01.05]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[106:06.31]There's a second house!
[106:10.59]Wait, no, what?
[106:14.80]House two?
[106:15.87]No, there's not enough walls!
[106:19.55]There are not enough walls in this house.
[106:22.77]Is there a house three?
[106:28.19]Jerma, you're a fucking idiot.
[106:29.11]You broke the walls.
[106:34.85]Right.
[106:37.26]You're right.
[106:37.80]Okay, well, why can't I just... Okay.
[106:41.58]I have a solution.
[106:45.54]We need to build five walls.
[106:48.02]More than that.
[106:49.84]With the build tool?
[106:51.48]Okay.
[106:57.43]We need just enough room to be able to paint.
[107:00.47]On all sides.
[107:04.85]That's four.
[107:06.15]This is four, eight, twelve, sixteen, twenty.
[107:08.79]Okay.
[107:12.62]Build a maze.
[107:13.60]That's another one I could do.
[107:15.70]I could build a maze.
[107:17.48]I'm going to build a maze.
[107:18.59]Alright, welcome to fucking House Flipper week.
[107:21.51]I'm sorry.
[107:23.13]I think maybe at least a thousand people just put their hands in the air and went, god damn it.
[107:27.15]Okay, so what do I need?
[107:31.95]Beige.
[107:32.93]We'll do beige first.
[107:41.49]Natural beige.
[107:42.73]5%.
[107:45.41]6%.
[107:46.83]These ones have to be beige.
[107:48.49]Alright, where's the beige?
[107:51.67]Vipers.
[107:52.33]God damn it.
[107:58.67]Yeah, yeah.
[107:59.55]If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve my cat puke noise.
[108:05.39]Come on, guys.
[108:14.02]12%.
[108:14.20]Is this... I can't tell if this is working.
[108:19.70]Is my grand scheme actually working?
[108:23.43]I think so.
[108:23.87]Because this is technically 14%.
[108:32.35]Yeah, it is working.
[108:46.14]Carpet Piss Omega Lull House.
[108:55.22]This is gonna be such a pain in the ass.
[108:56.80]This is gonna be such a pain in the ass.
[109:03.23]Get rid of this chair.
[109:05.35]Get rid of this stuff.
[109:06.45]I need... Okay.
[109:07.39]18%.
[109:07.41]Shit!
[109:12.59]I have to build so many more walls that are separated.
[109:32.11]Build them all together?
[109:34.11]Will that be more space?
[109:35.49]But like... We can do that.
[109:43.86]Yep.
[109:44.36]We can do... Alright.
[109:45.58]We can do like a McRib system.
[109:47.51]That works.
[109:47.87]Yeah.
[109:48.27]It works.
[109:51.45]That'll be way more surface to paint.
[110:07.36]Clear reactor house.
[110:12.53]That's very funny.
[110:20.01]Large generator.
[110:25.12]Build them outside.
[110:26.00]Did they add that in House Flipper?
[110:29.06]I remember you couldn't do that before.
[110:33.67]Do it outside.
[110:34.69]Wait, can you build outside?
[110:36.83]Can you?
[110:39.23]How the fuck is this still 15%?
[110:40.73]This is beige, right?
[110:45.69]Light biscuit?
[110:47.45]No, this is wrong.
[110:50.74]Natural beige.
[110:54.30]That's not it either.
[110:58.10]Oh, god damn it.
[111:00.32]Buy another one.
[111:00.90]Buy like three of them.
[111:03.71]That's light biscuit.
[111:09.68]Okay, there we go.
[111:10.76]Now we're going.
[111:12.56]Now we're cooking with gas.
[111:14.30]No scary.
[111:34.10]Is that loud?
[111:36.17]Is that really loud?
[111:36.85]I'm sorry if it was.
[111:42.59]No?
[111:42.97]Alright.
[111:43.43]I'm sorry if it was.
[111:44.55]Sorry.
[111:44.81]Okay.
[111:48.12]25%.
[111:49.28]Can I build this shit outside?
[111:50.80]I don't think I can, guys.
[111:51.60]Wait.
[111:55.50]Does this not count?
[111:58.58]No, no build tool.
[111:59.42]I can't.
[112:02.09]Remember, you're so loud.
[112:04.34]Everyone always yells at me because they say I'm too quiet, and now everyone says I'm loud.
[112:07.44]Okay, we're gonna need some more walls.
[112:14.12]What are we at?
[112:14.70]20 what percent?
[112:17.18]Late wall tiles.
[112:17.82]Okay, wait.
[112:18.74]Wallpaper with bamboo.
[112:19.82]Let's do that.
[112:20.32]Because I know I can do that, like, over here.
[112:22.88]I don't need very much of this.
[112:31.73]One guy?
[112:32.17]Okay.
[112:38.62]Get rid of this.
[112:39.12]I don't want this.
[112:44.34]There we are.
[112:44.70]Okay.
[112:45.08]How many do I need?
[112:45.70]Eleven.
[112:46.42]Something's in my eye.
[112:56.05]Something's in my eye.
[112:56.57]Something's in my eye.

[113:50.16]How much money do I have?
[113:51.17]I stole a lot of money from somebody, right?
[113:52.97]I want to put this shit down.
[113:56.91]I don't want to hold this anymore.
[113:58.75]Going on the outside.
[114:10.68]Okay.
[114:12.32]Where am I missing this?
[114:13.36]Where's the white?
[114:15.22]Okay.
[114:16.11]Ah, I see.
[114:18.49]Go one of these.
[114:21.97]Okay.

[114:28.75]Oh, that's that right there.
[114:29.65]Alright, sell this shit.
[114:31.67]Get this out of here.
[114:36.81]So I need to build the walls.
[114:39.37]Didn't I already build five walls?
[114:49.12]Shower beds.
[114:56.11]You need... Alright, who made the dumb joke that got him started on this awful house?
[115:00.05]I don't think anybody did.
[115:00.87]Nobody did.
[115:03.96]This wasn't some kind of joke or, well, let's do this.
[115:07.16]No.
[115:08.92]I don't think so, at least.
[115:16.16]That's all I had to do.
[115:22.30]Why is that in here?
[115:23.16]Isn't that kind of a weird place to have that?
[115:27.97]Okay, sink.
[115:30.67]Sink.
[115:32.72]Turn it back on?
[115:33.46]I can't turn it back on.
[115:35.04]I didn't know what it did.
[115:36.63]It was just a random valve.
[115:50.62]Quick, break it again.
[115:51.96]That's not gonna work.
[115:54.05]Wait, it might.
[115:54.69]Hold on.
[116:07.15]Nope.

[119:32.47]I got a tweet I made, like, four years ago.
[119:41.86]I- I don't- I don't- Hey, Jared, remember when you, like, wrote- said this, like, on Twitter five years ago?
[119:47.50]Remember when this- when this video, this specific moment that happened in video 212- like, 25?
[119:51.46]In 2012?
[119:58.63]I don't even remember what I had for lunch yesterday.
[120:04.31]I don't even know.
[120:04.85]I don't even remember what it was.
[120:06.41]I don't know these things that I say.
[120:08.13]That's a humble brag.
[120:13.05]Forgetting what you ate for lunch yesterday is concerning.
[120:16.84]That's not a humble brag.
[120:25.75]It's Wednesday.
[120:26.57]Is it still Ursula?
[120:28.81]Alright, let me just focus on my HDTV.
[120:35.25]I need to wait.
[120:35.81]What do I have to do?
[120:36.61]Okay, this is broken.
[120:39.80]This.
[120:41.10]I gotta mount a sink here.
[120:44.62]What kind of sink do they want?
[120:45.72]Build the walls.
[120:46.36]I have to build these walls, right?
[120:48.32]I don't know what the fuck they want.
[120:52.58]A-D-H-D-G-T-V.
[121:02.83]What is A-D-H-G-T-V?
[121:06.61]Is that... Like, the guy renovates a house, but he cannot decide on the color of the couch he wants, so he keeps getting it upholstered for the whole episode, and that's it?
[121:22.86]A guy paints like half of the house and then just kind of starts watching TV.
[121:29.93]Basically, it's this stream.
[121:34.67]No, it's not.
[121:35.39]This is not what I would do if I was on HGTV.
[121:43.26]Walls.
[121:43.84]What do they want these walls?
[121:46.22]Build wall.
[121:47.92]Modify the room's layout.
[121:57.11]Isn't that what I'm doing?
[121:58.30]It's the green on the map.
[122:06.80]Oh, right, okay.
[122:09.96]Wait, that's not even it.
[122:20.07]What the fuck is that for?
[122:24.85]You just built an annoying wall?
[122:33.77]It's a wall.
[122:37.07]Yeah, I know what it is.
[122:38.15]But why is it?
[122:42.15]It sticks out too far.
[122:43.11]Okay, we need young flower bud.
[122:49.28]Or booger beige.
[122:50.96]I'm gonna go with booger beige.
[123:01.75]Place little walls on the ceiling.
[123:05.48]Paint with beige.
[123:08.28]How much of their room, their house, do they want beige?
[123:12.84]You guys thought I was boring.
[123:14.04]75 out of 80 with the other one.
[123:19.40]Where's the green one?
[123:32.07]What's it called?
[123:34.13]This one.
[123:40.90]Just complete the ones that can be completed.
[123:47.46]Okay.
[123:48.98]Wall with bamboo.
[123:52.52]Alright.
[123:54.40]Closing one door, opening two more.
[124:07.25]There it is.
[124:14.19]That made no sense.
[124:15.69]Yeah, it did.
[124:20.01]How do I drop shit?
[124:24.54]Press E to pick up the $60.
[124:25.98]Here we go.
[124:27.04]Alright, look.
[124:31.60]I'm gonna fix this.
[124:32.74]Check it out.
[124:34.77]Alright.
[124:37.83]Lay floor tiles.
[124:39.03]Floor panel pine.
[124:41.57]You got it?
[124:46.46]Lower panel pine.
[124:50.25]Alright.
[124:51.61]About right here.
[124:52.25]2%.
[124:55.71]I think the entire house is supposed to be like this.
[125:04.30]How would you have room for anything else?
[125:07.68]There's only 27%.
[125:17.93]32%?
[125:18.33]Is the bathroom pine wood?
[125:22.30]This is the worst house I've made.
[125:23.46]I didn't make this house.
[125:24.68]Remember, we gotta get it right here.
[125:26.94]I didn't make this house.
[125:29.24]I'm just getting money to be able to do my own house.
[125:31.66]This is me renovating somebody else's.
[125:34.92]And yes, I took the money up front.
[125:45.23]This is horrible.
[125:48.52]Regardless of how much I fucked this whole thing up, that doesn't matter.
[125:51.22]This whole house is a wood floor.
[125:54.44]The entire thing, the same color, everything.
[125:58.02]Even in the bathroom?
[126:00.80]Only 50% so far.
[126:05.42]How?
[126:05.78]Do you want me to put wood floor on the roof?
[126:20.55]This is so stupid.
[126:29.90]80%.
[126:32.14]It's because I made everything one room.
[126:36.08]So I'm never going to be able to complete all the tasks.
[126:41.21]Please.
[126:41.61]What do you want?
[126:45.99]What?
[126:46.31]What is it?
[126:48.82]Guys, you aren't going to believe this.
[126:49.78]Hey, Woozadoo is in my bedroom.
[126:52.44]I wish I was in your bedroom.
[126:56.99]Yeah, what?
[126:57.71]What do you want me to say?
[127:08.35]Wrong link.
[127:15.01]Wait, is this the go through Jerma's Twitter comedy hour?
[127:21.00]Let's go to like 2012 and find some comedy.
[127:29.77]Alright, that's it.
[127:30.27]That's Team YouTube Money's new album cover.
[127:33.01]Here's the story of that.
[127:34.81]Team YouTube Money was the name.
[127:37.18]I didn't pick the name.
[127:38.00]The name was already there.
[127:39.88]We got called in from the benches.
[127:42.62]Because, uh, I believe, if I get the story right, I want to see if I get the story right.
[127:46.73]I think the Incredible Orb legally couldn't participate in the United States.
[127:52.11]In that Shootmania tournament.
[127:55.67]So we had, we were like the bench players that came in.
[127:59.19]If I remember that correctly.
[128:02.68]Like, it was supposed to be like Orb was in like the tournament or something.
[128:08.13]Then we were like, at least I was like the B team.
[128:10.59]It was, I was the, I was the anchor.
[128:17.78]You guys don't remember the, that's a, okay.
[128:20.16]A long time ago, like 10 years, eight years ago or so now, seven years ago, I played in a Shoot Mania Storm tournament.
[128:28.11]And we almost won the whole thing.
[128:31.93]It was streamed.
[128:33.15]This was streamed.
[128:35.73]Like seven and a half years ago.
[128:38.62]And what it really came down to was MLC stealth just carried us all the way to the final fucking round.
[128:47.59]Star was pretty good too.
[128:48.53]It was me, Star, and MLC stealth.
[128:50.01]But it was supposed to be, I think, me... No, it was supposed to be Star, like, MLC stealth, and Orb.
[128:54.19]But, like, he couldn't... He, like, legally wasn't allowed to participate because he wasn't a US citizen or something.
[129:00.65]Here's a video of it.
[129:05.67]Yeah, it was a big deal.
[129:11.21]I was an actual, yeah, a gaming warlord.
[129:14.17]Yeah, gaming anchor.
[129:17.02]You gotta have an anchor on the boat.
[129:18.98]MLC stealth was like the sails.
[129:22.28]Ster was like the solid wood.
[129:24.70]And I was the anchor.
[129:27.70]And be careful.
[129:28.90]You want to go on a fucking trip without an anchor with a boat?
[129:32.26]What if a storm comes?
[129:33.98]What if you need to drop that anchor hard into the ground?
[129:36.69]I'm here.
[129:42.25]I'm here to- I'm ready.
[129:44.83]The train needs a caboose.
[129:52.28]Grandma, please just make the house less bad.
[130:02.96]Actual, literal dead weight.
[130:05.20]Alright, let me finish this.
[130:07.60]Let me finish this, please.
[130:13.22]This looks like the house of Hellraiser.
[130:17.61]No, no, alright.
[130:18.77]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[130:20.23]Let me finish this first.
[130:23.59]You know, I'm laughing at that, but I don't even know what they're talking about.
[130:27.61]I haven't seen the movie in so long.
[130:28.75]I just hear the word Hellraiser and I think of the guy with the needles in his face.
[130:31.95]And I'm just like, holy shit, this probably looks horrible then.
[130:36.66]And then that cube that bites you, right?
[130:38.68]And it needs to drink your blood and then go take a portal.
[130:41.86]I don't even remember that movie.
[130:47.42]Okay.
[130:48.74]What's next?
[130:49.79]Mountable toilet fire fairy.
[130:53.07]Okay, I need mountable toilet furry.
[130:55.33]A toilet fairy.
[131:00.54]I don't think I want to know about that.
[131:03.38]Was it toilet fairy?
[131:07.06]Mountable toilet fairy.
[131:16.88]Nice.
[131:17.20]Okay.
[131:19.94]It's too bad we couldn't, like, lift this up and let the water go in there.
[131:22.52]That's just complete and total.
[131:24.91]Ugh.
[131:25.31]Okay.
[131:26.27]Old-fashioned sink.
[131:36.45]Where's it supposed to even go?
[131:37.43]Is it actually supposed to go right here?
[131:41.34]Ow.
[131:43.72]Ow.
[131:45.68]I don't think I can even assemble this.
[131:53.72]Here comes the toilet fairy.
[132:04.47]What would that even be?
[132:05.97]Like, you have the tooth fairy.
[132:08.79]The tooth fairy, if you lose a tooth.
[132:12.01]Hey, the...
[132:14.34]The Tooth Fairy left a dollar under your pillow!
[132:18.49]Does the Toilet Fairy leave a dollar in the toilet?
[132:22.01]After, like, you took a dump in it?
[132:27.47]How come I can't close this thing out?
[132:28.83]Am I doing this wrong?
[132:33.98]Why- How come I can't do this?
[132:37.08]That was- Alright, that was weird.
[132:41.62]Okay, short, narrow curtain.
[132:43.62]I'm assuming for the bathtub thing here.
[132:51.40]Short, narrow curtain.
[133:02.86]Multiple... Multiple wide curtain.
[133:08.33]That's not for the bathtub.
[133:14.80]Mountable wide curtain.
[133:23.54]What is this?
[133:24.96]Oh, it goes up here.
[133:26.12]There's not enough room to place it.
[133:29.13]How?
[133:34.31]Oh, come on.
[133:34.85]Alright, we're almost... It doesn't matter.
[133:40.81]Place object.
[133:45.88]What does it want me to place?
[133:46.86]Tasks.
[133:48.48]Nothing in the garage, right?
[133:50.06]Okay, I have to place these objects.
[133:57.99]We're almost there.
[133:58.53]Did it!
[134:05.73]Alright, we're there, we're there, we're there.
[134:06.83]Okay, we're done, done, done, done, done, done.
[134:08.85]I can do it.
[134:09.81]Let's go.
[134:10.19]The job is complete.
[134:18.75]Let's see the before and after.
[134:21.35]The garage looks nice.
[134:38.14]It doesn't look that bad.
[134:44.55]Oh, mega lull.
[134:46.79]The bucket of paint, yeah.
[134:49.07]Jerma, Jerma, stop wasting channel points.
[134:51.37]They're going to be so valuable eventually.
[134:53.65]That's my excuse.
[134:56.19]Lead to The Simpsons house.
[135:00.94]Let me see if there's any new houses to buy.
[135:02.66]I got 350 grand.
[135:08.18]Mail.
[135:10.56]No, I'm not doing this.
[135:12.48]Wait.
[135:15.78]Look for like Bart Simpson or something, right?
[135:18.10]Do I have an email from Bart Simpson?
[135:22.97]Nope.
[135:24.37]Damn it.
[135:28.03]It's like writing a letter to Santa Claus and expecting him to write back.
[135:30.99]I sent Rocco from Rocco's Modern Life a thank you letter.
[135:36.58]I liked his show, but he didn't write me back.
[135:48.56]Alright, the game's gonna really open up here when I'm done with Tutorial House 4.
[135:51.81]We're gonna do this quick.
[136:03.04]Ratatouille was really- yeah.
[136:05.58]Alright, Ed purchased the small house on sale.
[136:07.62]The couple that was selling the house split up during the renovation.
[136:10.80]So some furniture is brand new.
[136:12.72]Oh, the house is messy.
[136:14.86]Ed has some doubts when it comes to choosing which of the existing solutions should be carried over.
[136:18.42]Sure.
[136:18.66]Alright, let's go.
[136:20.52]Quick.
[136:21.64]Clean everything.
[136:24.51]Get this trash out of here.
[136:27.35]And then we're going to make our dream house.
[136:32.03]The maze.
[136:40.94]I have garden flipper too, where's my lawnmower?
[136:46.26]No lawnmower?
[136:48.62]What?
[136:48.80]Remember the lawnmower?
[136:57.50]The lawnmower sucked.
[136:59.12]It was so hard to control.
[137:11.70]Good?
[137:12.02]Alright, that's the whole front yard's good?
[137:17.35]This is very messy, you're right.
[137:20.61]What are these?
[137:25.03]Wait, I thought these were like silicone gel packs.
[137:27.15]What are these?
[137:27.67]Is this water?
[137:28.27]How did you get this much water on the couch?
[137:44.67]From the shower.
[137:48.51]Huh?
[137:55.38]How's the bathroom doing?
[137:56.18]Bathroom doesn't need anything.
[137:59.42]Quick, make a piss carpet.
[138:01.72]Okay.
[138:02.34]Make a decision.
[138:03.15]What is it?
[138:03.45]This one's gonna be quick.
[138:05.49]Leather furniture is stylish.
[138:06.63]Let's keep what we have.
[138:07.99]We will choose furniture in a similar style.
[138:12.24]Um, no, I don't like leather couches and leather stuff.
[138:14.46]You can ruin it too easily.
[138:15.32]Give me the thing that can be wiped off with a towel if you dump a whole coffee on it.
[138:19.10]Uh, let's go modern.
[138:22.15]Leather arm.
[138:22.75]I don't want leather.
[138:25.49]Alfred leather armchair.
[138:34.81]Okay, paint.
[138:35.53]Okay, steel gray.
[138:36.57]180. 180.
[138:45.30]This is the kind of house I'm talking about.
[138:46.64]I'm gonna love this place.
[138:51.70]Gray, gray, everything gray, and then one piece of blue furniture.
[138:58.38]It will impress the shit out of anybody.
[139:00.00]You ready?
[139:03.24]Gray walls, a light blue couch, and have maybe a little bit like of a dark blue accent.
[139:16.11]And you better make damn sure that you have something nautical on the wall.
[139:19.15]Like a picture of a beach, or a sailor's cap, or hanging on the wall.
[139:30.26]It's a prison architect.
[139:33.96]It's a SpongeBob prison.
[139:35.38]How is that a SpongeBob prison?
[139:45.30]true true true true alright hold on we got alright link cooldown begins now link cooldown begins now with every single vtuber ever every single one every single one and Jerma and Jerma
[140:11.90]I was just gonna say, what is this?
[140:34.09]Alright, for a second, I don't know why, my brain is just wired wrong in some places.
[140:39.75]I thought, I see this, I see the tweet, it's Jerma985 out of context.
[140:44.26]I was like, Jerma985, okay, and I click it, and I'm like, is that me?
[140:46.98]I was like, I didn't- when- Jerma 9- Jerma out of context, I was like: Did I do that at some point?
[140:55.48]Then I was like, nah, that's, nah, that's not me.
[141:03.05]How do you get like an avatar?
[141:05.95]Should I do like an avatar stream?
[141:13.17]If I were to do an avatar stream, I would kind of want to get like a custom one where it was just like a big green slime.
[141:22.78]And the whole stream I'm just like roleplaying as this slime ball guy.
[141:29.95]That's just like, I like to take breaks every like 10 minutes.
[141:38.03]Is that Mr. Greens?
[141:42.12]Slime guy.
[141:43.10]Hey, welcome to twitch.tv/slime guy TV.
[141:51.41]Mr. Greens evolved.
[142:03.62]I have to look into that.
[142:04.78]That actually sounds like fun.
[142:14.74]Alright, well, let's start there.
[142:19.88]I kind of do.
[142:21.02]I kind of don't, though.
[142:25.33]Here's what I know.
[142:26.51]I know that I just said I want to do Mr. Greens as the slime guy.
[142:31.35]I get it.
[142:31.69]I understand.
[142:37.46]Thanks for that.
[142:38.86]He knows.
[142:39.42]I'm going to stop that.
[142:42.34]I'm not doing that voice.
[142:44.97]That's not me.
[142:46.09]We're watching a video.
[142:52.39]There's no video on screen, so that is just a voice talking.
[143:04.95]Alright, Slime Guy.
[143:06.29]Slime Guy avatar stream.
[143:12.27]I think I'm gonna do it on a different channel.
[143:15.26]You know what I mean?
[143:16.74]Would you guys care?
[143:17.68]Would you guys be mad if I started a new channel called, like, the fucking Slime Guy or something?
[143:24.92]And I just, like, told you guys, like, you guys knew, like, I just did it.
[143:28.89]I didn't stream on Jerma.
[143:29.89]It wasn't even me.
[143:37.66]I don't think I would tell you guys when I was gonna do it.
[143:39.92]I think that's... Yeah, I wouldn't tell you guys when.
[143:42.24]I wouldn't even tell you guys the account.
[143:44.00]I'm just gonna stream as the fucking slime guy.
[143:53.14]And you're never gonna even know.
[143:54.74]And I'm gonna stream to nobody.
[143:57.94]I'm gonna take like a fucking week off and just stream as that guy.
[144:08.80]He's gonna have 10 viewers.
[144:09.94]Alright, how much more grey do I need?
[144:27.13]We're gonna find you.
[144:28.09]I bet you will.
[144:33.57]Whatever happened to Bugleberry Week?
[144:35.23]Yeah, this is kind of an evolution of that, I think.
[144:40.40]This is an evolution of that.
[144:41.47]Oh yeah, V-Tuber.
[144:53.69]And then I could just... I would just be like a different person.
[144:59.50]Like, German995 has his life and his friends, but fucking Mr. Slime.
[145:06.06]I'll be a fucking V-Tuber.
[145:14.64]You guys will come in and tell me all this, like, fucked up shit that Mr. Slimes did, and I'll just be like, I don't know.
[145:20.59]Perfect example.
[145:22.01]I used to use Grandpa as a way to swear on the channel ten years ago.
[145:25.87]So, oh yeah, I'm ready for this one.
[145:31.05]You remember that?
[145:31.75]Because it wasn't me.
[145:32.67]It was Grandpa.
[145:33.85]Oh, I didn't say that.
[145:35.83]I didn't say, shut the fuck up, you fucking stupid idiots.
[145:39.07]None of you guys have any idea what you're talking about.
[145:41.07]Like, no, that wasn't me.
[145:42.29]I could say whatever I wanted.
[145:43.49]And I was just Mr. Nice Guy Jeremy.
[145:50.85]It ain't me.
[145:52.70]It's Mr. Slime.
[146:14.69]slimy motherfucker yeah and if anybody found me you better you better not say a single thing in chat besides talking about how disgusting Mr. slime is I want you all to hate watch that stream I'm just gonna go off and everyone just like be wicked mean
[146:39.01]This guy's a fucking idiot.
[146:40.23]Oh, Mr. Slime.
[146:41.17]What a piece of shit.
[146:43.51]Oh, he's gross.
[146:44.51]Look, he just, like, shot boogers and just... I don't want a chat room.
[146:53.00]I'll be, like, banning people and shit and talking tons of shit.
[147:00.81]It's not even me.
[147:02.15]Jerma hasn't streamed in, like, four or five days.
[147:04.31]It's not me.
[147:06.65]Now here's the real kicker here.
[147:08.47]What if Mr. Slime becomes more popular than Jeremy?
[147:12.98]What do I do then?
[147:13.80]That's kind of what I'm afraid of.
[147:21.38]And then I have to stop being Jerma and like retire as Jerma.
[147:26.63]And then be Mr. Slime.
[147:33.97]It'd be Hannah Montana.
[147:44.19]Well, we'll see.
[147:50.37]I definitely want to, like, figure that out, though.
[147:52.02]That would be kind of fun.
[147:54.78]What would the voice, what would VTuber voice, what would the voice be?
[147:58.68]I'd have the effects thing on.
[147:59.66]It would be something, it would be something fucking gross.
[148:03.00]Be like, something like this.
[148:09.37]And, like,
[148:12.00]Shut up.
[148:13.10]Shut up and get out of here.
[148:16.02]Get slimed.
[148:19.28]And that's the person I would be banning.
[148:29.20]Okay, it is far too big for this interior.
[148:31.48]Let's replace it with something.
[148:33.45]I hope it becomes more popular than me.
[148:37.53]I do, I really hope so.
[148:38.55]I hope Mr. Slime, I hope Mr. Green Greens becomes a huge star.
[148:49.77]Do you keep it, this piece of house?
[148:51.25]Yeah, I keep it.
[148:52.03]I don't want to do anything.
[148:52.79]Fuck doing work.
[149:00.56]I like Mr. Slimes more than I like Jerma already.
[149:04.20]Well, good.
[149:05.78]Go make him famous.
[149:13.11]Okay.
[149:13.97]I thought it said, hang a bathtub.
[149:16.83]I was like, that's fucked up.
[149:19.16]Okay, hanging long bulb.
[149:20.82]Okay, rectangular carpet crossy.
[149:28.28]Uh, gravibus chandelier.
[149:41.54]This ain't even my house.
[149:42.34]This is just tutorial.
[149:44.79]What are you gonna do?
[149:45.41]I'm not gonna tell you when the fuck that's happening.
[149:51.13]No.
[149:52.43]I don't care.
[149:53.43]Guys, I don't care if I waste like 25 fucking hours of my life.
[149:58.55]I don't even care.
[150:00.03]I'm never gonna tell you where it is.
[150:06.46]Enormous wooden table.
[150:19.86]I mean, this is all just supposed to go in here, so.
[150:22.30]We're just doing this for the money.
[150:25.68]Mr. Slime waiting room.
[150:30.98]Well, this is pretty enormous.
[150:34.74]Leather sofa?
[150:35.56]What am I missing here?

[151:02.65]You know, like, doing the Mr. Slime stream once a week or once every, like, couple of weeks?
[151:06.45]I think that'd be a great stress reliever.
[151:10.35]It would just be me just flying off the fucking handle.
[151:12.66]Like, just talking shit.
[151:14.16]What an outlet for me.
[151:27.40]Anything I need to say or get off my chest.
[151:29.28]This is slime.
[151:35.46]Can I be a mod for the slime guy?
[151:37.11]We're not taking slime guy applications.
[151:44.87]Okay.

[155:52.25]Why is it so robotic?
[155:53.25]It wasn't supposed to be like that.
[155:55.01]It just sounded like you had part of your headphones were out a little bit and you didn't plug them all the way in before you opened up an audio file.
[156:10.20]I'm gonna have to work on that.
[156:12.08]It'll be a completely original voice.
[156:21.02]Okay, floor panel.

[157:01.79]Most people can only do one.
[157:02.75]They're on.
[157:14.14]I actually kinda like that floor.
[157:23.51]Wait, there was a whole nother... Where was that room?
[157:29.35]What was that?

[157:35.64]Is that where we put all the trash?
[157:39.84]It was the garage, yeah, whatever.

[161:43.95]I've owned this house for a very long time.
[161:49.07]These pictures have taken a very long time away from each other.
[161:59.40]There aren't any doors.
[162:02.57]So I have enough money for the meme house, right?
[162:04.87]Is the moon thing, is it going to be stupid?
[162:09.01]Or is it fun?
[162:19.02]I hate this house.
[162:19.74]I'll take it.
[162:20.24]I'm not selling this one.
[162:23.16]I'll sell the other one.
[162:25.12]Look at this place.
[162:26.00]I got double fountains.
[162:28.46]No, there's no way I'm going to sell this place.
[162:29.90]I love this place.
[162:36.46]Okay.
[162:37.68]Owned.
[162:40.38]Burned house?
[162:47.58]Family Guy house.
[162:48.42]Family Guy house.
[162:49.24]Slime house.
[162:51.40]I live in the Family Guy house.
[162:57.64]What happened in here?
[162:58.58]I didn't even do... Okay.
[163:00.42]I didn't even attempt to clean anything.
[163:05.15]This is why always go look at your apartment before you sign any documents.
[163:15.13]Yeah, let's sell it.
[163:17.77]Submit it for a garden contest.
[163:21.11]It's a Japanese-style garden.
[163:23.94]They're just lying.
[163:27.62]I haven't sent it in.
[163:30.56]Okay, put this on auction.
[163:33.72]Anything more than $25,000 to this place is a... You're losing way too much money.
[163:45.59]Same guy.
[163:46.13]He likes this place more than the other one.
[163:52.98]Dolan's buying it again.
[163:59.77]Your offer is too low.
[164:00.71]I can sell the house for $1 more.
[164:02.22]He refused it.
[164:04.58]That would have been so funny.
[164:11.89]There are no before and after pictures.
[164:13.17]There are only just ugly pictures.
[164:18.35]Alright, if you went on Zillow and you saw these as the photos for the place, would you do it?
[164:23.22]Would you move in?
[164:31.29]But no, but it was a reverse.
[164:32.81]So it looked like that, but they didn't update the pictures after they renovated.
[164:35.70]They put like $80,000 into that place to make it nice.
[164:39.98]And they're using old photos.
[164:41.20]See?
[164:42.70]That's why they always say, don't judge a book by its cover.
[164:53.70]$192,000.
[164:53.72]This better not be a bad idea.
[164:57.12]This is all the money I have.
[165:00.33]I'm not selling the fa- Oh, right!
[165:02.19]It is the Family Guy hou- Holy shit!
[165:06.63]Oh my god!
[165:07.59]It's the- It is!
[165:09.98]It's like... Architecturally, it's the house.
[165:13.60]It's the Family Guy house.
[165:20.68]I thought it was just the outside.
[165:23.58]We knew this.
[165:24.48]No, no, I thought it was just like, oh yeah, the yellow paint and it looked like the house.
[165:28.16]I forgot I made the Family Guy house.
[165:35.03]Okay.
[165:36.55]$492,000.
[165:36.57]Let's go buy it.
[165:41.03]Portfolio.
[165:42.07]What is that?
[165:43.83]Okay.
[165:44.93]For purchase.
[165:48.56]House on the moon.
[165:50.83]This house allows residents to move away from the most earthly problems.
[165:54.35]Family who moves in here may have problems with commuting, but the unearthed... Do I really buy this for $480,000?
[166:00.24]That's all the money I've made in the whole game.
[166:13.83]How do I make a cool house here?
[166:20.35]Like, growing weed?
[166:30.84]Garden hose?
[166:32.62]Wait.
[166:38.41]Why is this in the game?
[166:39.35]I can clean with this?
[166:51.70]I ran out of fuel.
[166:52.62]I have to buy a new one in the store.
[166:55.99]Are you shitting me?
[167:05.35]Which two garden hose?
[167:06.81]I don't have it.
[167:07.37]Demolition triceps?
[167:20.39]Where's the garden hose?
[167:26.23]You did an air blast.
[167:30.09]Okay, this house is a waste of money.
[167:33.91]I'm going to clean it up and then put it on the auction.
[167:35.55]I'm going to try to make a million dollars.
[167:39.70]I don't like this house.
[167:40.50]It's just... No, I don't like this.
[167:45.62]Yeah, that's the plan.
[167:46.18]I don't want this.
[167:48.91]I'm just going to sell it and I'm going to make like $800,000 and then we can buy the most expensive stuff in the world.
[167:58.88]This house is already ready.
[167:59.86]Flamethrower mega lull.
[168:03.60]I can't, I don't have enough.
[168:06.20]This is the most expensive house.
[168:07.39]Yeah, I'm about to make a lot of expensive profit from it too.
[168:18.03]Flip the moon house, yeah?
[168:20.95]That's the idea.
[168:27.95]You're already ready.
[168:28.67]I just gotta clean it up a little.
[168:30.15]I don't need any new furniture or anything.
[168:33.87]Look, they're getting a car.
[168:34.77]They're getting a weed factory.
[168:35.91]They're getting a big security system.
[168:43.01]What's this for?
[168:43.49]Okay.
[168:43.61]Okay.
[168:56.04]Alright.
[168:57.06]It's a little cleaned up.
[168:57.74]Is there an upstairs?
[168:58.44]They're just pissing into bottles.
[169:05.98]What is this weird bed setup?
[169:10.56]Why is this in a mirror?
[169:11.61]That's odd, right?
[169:17.51]It's like an office?
[169:20.07]Two offices next to each other?
[169:30.56]There's no bathroom.
[169:35.32]If you walked over here, and you just like got up on a cliff and just pissed into the air, what would happen?
[169:45.31]Would it slowly fall?
[169:50.55]Or would it just kind of go into outer space?
[169:55.17]What's the gravity like on the moon?
[169:56.31]It's like -2?
[169:59.74]Like, minus, like, 5% Earth?
[170:02.26]Minus 10% or something?
[170:03.22]What is it?
[170:03.50]Hiding his, like, piss bottles.
[170:14.95]It's one-sixth.
[170:24.03]It's kind of cool.
[170:27.15]Alright.
[170:27.51]Cool, cool.
[170:28.07]This is all expensive stuff.
[170:32.64]It's three fifths.
[170:35.18]Look at all this stuff.
[170:36.12]What is this?
[170:38.52]Can I just sell everything in this whole house?
[170:40.12]How much is this worth?
[170:42.46]$280.
[170:44.58]Why not just sell everything and then sell the moon?
[170:53.99]You could do the garden thing.
[170:55.15]Yeah, I did the garden DLC like a year ago or so.
[170:57.71]It was a lot of fun.
[171:00.08]Should I sell the car?
[171:00.74]Alright, I'm going to sell the car first.
[171:05.72]What?
[171:07.88]Go to job.
[171:09.84]I thought I was about to give this a full letter grade.
[171:12.35]That was close.
[171:13.09]Okay.
[171:16.83]I'm ready.
[171:19.17]Would I pay for it?
[171:19.69]$480?
[171:19.71]$482?
[171:19.73]Already made money.
[171:30.84]I feel like this guy's following me around.
[171:34.56]Starting to feel like... It's the moon, man.
[171:38.90]I want an extra 2,000.
[171:39.70]There we go.
[171:47.24]Acceptable.
[171:47.92]I made $20,000.
[171:50.32]Good.
[171:57.64]Now let's go do the real house.
[172:00.29]Shit, I'm burning time here.
[172:01.99]I'm burning time.
[172:05.01]It's been like three hours.
[172:06.03]It went by so quickly.
[172:16.50]No, not end of the stream voice.

[179:53.39]No, fuck that.
[179:54.07]I'm not making a Halloween house.

[180:04.02]You think I'm going to give in to that?
[180:08.16]Nope.
[180:13.78]It could be screaming faces in the bedrooms.
[180:16.04]It doesn't matter.
[180:21.30]Oh, I just saw the lights.
[180:27.83]Wait, I have to spray the house?
[180:36.20]Good thing I don't have any neighbors because I'm a fucking wacko.

[188:13.88]I keep hearing doors open.
[188:22.73]Okay, this is it.
[188:23.81]Here we go.
[188:38.34]The FOV just went to like 300.

[188:45.64]It's not a monster at all.
[188:46.52]It's gas.
[188:46.98]That's what that sound is.
[189:04.45]Is there anything I can do?
[189:06.57]I'm selling this house.
[189:07.21]I don't even want to do this.
[189:09.55]I want to do a different house.
[189:10.59]I don't like this one.
[189:13.53]Bunny moved.
[189:31.78]Whoa!
[189:34.33]Dolan gets outbid for the first time.
[189:38.95]Look in the backyard.
[189:39.87]Wait, wait, what, what, what?
[189:41.03]Refuse offer.
[189:42.73]Did we find $6,700?
[189:44.98]Whatever.
[189:46.00]That's nothing.
[189:47.68]I'm fucking... I got like $300,000.
[189:48.74]That's fine.
[189:49.34]Where do you want to go?
[189:53.16]You didn't get rid of the curse.
[189:57.46]That's not part of the deal.
[189:58.20]Look in the backyard.
[190:00.07]Look in the backyard.
[190:15.61]Who's in here?
[190:18.77]Bury it.
[190:22.49]Burying the coffin will probably break the curse on this house.
[190:27.67]Wait, what?
[190:33.30]Oh, nice!
[190:39.80]Whoa, alright, cool.
[190:41.30]I got a house now.
[190:44.94]There's a huge basement down here.
[190:46.26]Oh my god, you know what's going down here.
[190:51.65]Alright, let's clean this place up.
[190:57.65]This is like four million dollars.
[190:58.73]I don't want any scary stuff.
[191:17.59]Okay, basement.
[191:19.14]This wall, the basement wall is terrible.
[191:24.48]This room has no taste.
[191:28.82]Well, hold on a second here.
[191:32.97]Not wanting Saturn devours his children on my wall.
[191:38.89]I mean, that's like a family den.
[191:43.08]That's where we're going to go play Scrabble together.
[191:55.50]I don't want to look at it.
[192:00.58]Basement Scrabble.
[192:01.84]What's wrong with Basement Scrabble?
[192:06.32]Why does this keep changing?
[192:07.13]There's a lot of fucked up rooms in this house.
[192:15.61]Alright, get rid of this.
[192:22.40]Stream the Scrabble game.
[192:25.12]No, not everything has to be streamed.
[192:26.52]Can I delete this stuff?
[192:46.70]Get rid of this door.
[192:49.82]What do I wanna do?
[192:50.65]Alright.
[192:50.99]What did I say I was gonna make?
[192:52.25]A man cave?
[192:56.91]I gotta think of what to do up here.
[193:04.37]Make a man- Wait, make a whole house man cave?
[193:10.68]No, that's not what I was gonna do.
[193:12.34]Is it gonna be a slime house?
[193:15.60]The door frame with the hammer.
[193:22.62]All green.
[193:23.40]All green.
[193:26.27]Make a smaller house inside of this house.
[193:37.62]We gotta get a clean slate and then I'll figure it out.
[193:41.38]Make a casino.
[193:42.28]There needs to be a clear upstairs.
[193:46.90]Clear.
[193:47.25]I need time to think.
[193:53.04]Make a casino.
[193:53.80]I don't think I can even make a casino.
[193:57.74]I'll try.
[193:58.20]Your house is a casino.
[194:05.42]Make it a hotel.
[194:06.35]A casino hotel.
[194:14.39]Make the actual house ridiculously smaller than the house.
[194:21.84]Okay, wait.
[194:22.50]I kind of like that idea.
[194:25.30]I like that idea.
[194:26.02]I like that idea.
[194:26.76]I want to do that.
[194:27.52]Okay, that's what I want to do first.
[194:29.88]The first thing I want to do is have there be... Can I even break this all down?
[194:41.09]I don't think I can do that.
[194:42.01]Get rid of this fucking thing.
[194:44.75]Okay.
[194:47.81]So this is the door.
[194:48.59]Where's the front door?
[194:54.92]And you're forced to go up the stairs.
[194:59.30]This is going to be walled off.
[195:00.25]There's not going to be anything here.
[195:01.47]You're forced to go up the stairs.
[195:05.71]And then this door here on the left is not going to be here.
[195:11.11]And there's going to be just a bed and a toilet like here.
[195:38.91]Rip frames.
[195:39.95]No kitchen?
[195:41.27]No, we'll make a kitchen.
[195:42.44]It'll work.
[195:48.64]I'm gonna put like... I'm gonna... Okay, it's gonna be like an electromagnetic house.
[195:55.25]All around the outside before I build the inside.
[195:57.47]It's gonna be a bunch of like... A bunch of like... Anti like 5G rays and stuff.
[196:05.59]And like tinfoil and stuff.
[196:10.37]I'm gonna be completely protected on the inside.
[196:18.29]I'm gonna make the walls out of, like, steel?
[196:19.77]It's a bunker house?
[196:35.12]Is it gonna be a DMT house?
[196:45.40]5G broadcasting station.
[196:55.04]A cell tower.
[196:57.46]Just make it a cell tower.
[196:58.52]Okay, looking- getting there, getting there.
[197:06.93]Get rid of all this shit.
[197:16.63]That's not where I want it to be.
[197:17.61]This is all junk.
[197:25.66]We don't need it right now.
[197:30.18]This is a great link.
[197:40.87]I think we've seen this before.
[197:48.56]Put that in the house.
[198:00.27]So big.
[198:03.13]This is a huge photo.
[198:17.59]Just fit to screen.
[198:34.74]Squished.
[198:36.38]Put that on.
[198:36.94]Alright, maybe.
[198:37.62]No, I don't want that.
[198:48.42]I cannot fucking believe I'm about to do the... Just make a small house in the house.
[198:53.28]I... Why am I doing this?
[198:58.30]This is not... This is stupid.
[199:11.83]Make a big house in a small house.
[199:18.43]No, it'll... No, no, no, no.
[199:20.92]Wait, wait, wait.
[199:23.38]I kind of like the idea of having a hotel.
[199:24.74]I don't know.
[199:27.48]I don't know yet.
[199:28.02]I don't know yet.
[199:28.68]I need to see.
[199:29.10]I got to get a clean slate.
[199:39.45]Or like a big theater.
[199:44.45]With a bunch of chairs, like a performance stage.
[199:47.03]Like the entire theater.
[200:03.03]Staff are asking for a raise.
[200:05.95]No, I mean just like the house is a movie theater.
[200:12.57]The actual house is a movie theater.
[200:27.03]Wait, I already made a movie theater?
[200:30.41]When did I make a movie theater in House Flipper?
[200:32.64]Did I?
[200:37.70]I made a movie theater?
[200:40.62]No, I didn't.
[200:41.82]I made a bowling alley.
[200:44.24]I made a mall with a bowling alley in it.
[200:45.99]I didn't make a movie theater.
[200:52.99]It's the same thing.
[200:55.77]No, just because some bowling alleys are in movie theaters and some movie theaters are in bowling alleys doesn't mean that they're the same thing.
[201:01.58]Okay.
[201:09.60]So this is the upstairs.
[201:10.94]This is the space that we have to work with.
[201:14.48]Down here.
[201:17.35]All this space out here.
[201:31.39]We're taking down everything.
[201:32.21]I need to be able to see everything.
[201:34.49]And it's the basement!
[201:36.67]Right, the basement too.
[201:37.81]Okay, hold on.
[201:42.12]Then make a bowling alley and movie theater.
[201:48.00]Make it a prison.
[202:03.12]Making a maze is kind of funny and like you finally get down here.
[202:15.85]Make a working society.
[202:28.03]Make it a maze where you have to go through the maze to get to the bathroom.
[202:35.55]in the ass.
[202:46.03]Unscrew?
[202:46.81]Oh, wait.
[202:47.09]Yeah, yeah.
[202:47.47]I don't want this to be the bathroom.
[202:50.75]Okay, cool.
[202:51.37]I, like, don't mind this yet.
[202:54.05]The house is gonna be green.
[203:08.83]It's a secret basement wall.
[203:10.57]Hey, I'm shitting myself.
[203:14.57]Where do I go?
[203:15.97]Well, I would just stay put.
[203:18.15]Then you can really figure out what the hell you're going to do with yourself.
[203:21.13]Running around and sprinting and screaming and oh my god, oh my god.
[203:23.52]That's not going to help you.
[203:24.66]That's going to make everything worse.
[203:34.64]Okay.
[203:36.68]Cool.
[203:41.38]Just make the whole house a solid wall.
[203:46.08]So I'll open it up.
[203:47.46]So I can get a good look.
[203:48.56]Alright.
[203:48.90]We got a good look.
[203:51.28]Basement goes down here.
[203:53.52]And so does that.
[203:56.65]The basement cannot be destroyed.
[203:57.95]It's a brick house.
[204:03.75]I'll fix it.
[204:06.45]Make a normal house.
[204:08.23]You know.
[204:09.21]That is what an interesting concept.
[204:13.12]Jeremy, why don't you just make a house?
[204:15.14]And make it look good.
[204:18.05]And really show us what you would do when you designed a house.
[204:25.37]I mean... Should I ban that guy?
[204:28.12]Because...
[204:42.34]Make a normal house.
[204:43.59]I don't think I even could.
[204:47.69]Alright, demolition is done.
[204:52.21]I got 250 grand.
[204:53.19]I'm good.
[204:54.35]Plenty of money.
[204:58.47]I'll wait outside.
[205:05.94]Shit, I have to do this too.
[205:08.74]Damn it.
[205:19.24]Dig up the coffin.
[205:20.83]I don't even know where the coffin was.
[205:26.75]Alright, look at the entrances.
[205:31.35]We've got... These lamps, I don't like them.
[205:38.13]Okay.
[205:39.37]Front door.
[205:39.91]This is what it looks like on the outside.
[205:43.92]You walk in.
[205:49.04]You can go right, you can go left, and down.
[205:51.62]This is important, because... Alright, here's what we're going to do.
[206:01.43]Okay, we're going to seal this off.
[206:19.47]Okay.
[206:22.01]Can't put one there.
[206:22.65]Alright, we're gonna seal that off.
[206:29.68]We're gonna seal this off too.
[206:33.20]And then I'm gonna make an entire elaborate, like... Hold on.
[206:37.70]I just tried to leave.
[206:38.72]If I'm gonna make a maze, I need to make it hard.
[206:51.57]Okay, is there a way that I can make the maze go down here and end up back up the stairs?
[206:58.53]Okay, I think so.
[207:03.53]Wait, I think there is.
[207:10.42]Oh yeah, I can do that.
[207:11.72]Are you kidding me?
[207:12.32]Because then I can go like this.
[207:19.05]No, I can't because I can't split this down the middle.
[207:24.97]Shit, alright.
[207:38.72]I need a second staircase.
[207:41.30]You can't remove and you cannot put new staircases in, unfortunately.
[207:53.21]Okay.
[207:54.67]So, I need to do something with this.
[207:57.33]I think this is where the illegal casino is, right?
[208:00.57]That makes complete sense.
[208:01.63]Let's start down here.
[208:04.65]Alright.
[208:11.32]Uh, more muscle.
[208:13.20]Store.
[208:13.66]We need to have a really, really crazy floor.
[208:28.33]Bathrooms.
[208:30.87]Should there be a bathroom down here?
[208:35.01]Molding.
[208:37.21]Let's go.
[208:38.65]Okay.
[208:39.27]Furniture.
[208:41.47]Gonna need some, like, bar tables.
[208:46.74]See a good one.
[208:51.26]Where's a good, like... No, these are good, like, poker tables or a blackjack table.
[208:55.32]We need, like, a big circle.
[208:59.30]How big are these?
[209:00.22]Well, they're enormous.
[209:05.18]Shelf?
[209:05.98]No.
[209:09.18]Leather.
[209:09.46]Okay.
[209:13.29]Let's do... Let's just see how big they are.
[209:16.21]I mean, they're fucking huge.
[209:23.54]There's only one game down here.
[209:32.45]One huge game of blackjack.
[209:36.64]That's so big.
[209:38.36]It's like 15 people can play.
[209:40.12]No, no, no, no, no.
[209:42.96]It's gotta be smaller.
[209:43.86]Table, table, table.
[209:46.52]We need table.
[209:50.64]Table.
[209:51.66]Ella.
[209:52.18]Table mooner.
[209:54.12]There we go.
[209:54.64]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[209:57.26]Okay, okay, okay.
[210:13.90]There we go.
[210:18.12]Okay, so this is like blackjack and shit.
[210:20.14]Slots are going to be in here.
[210:21.06]Let's see, what could be a slot?
[210:25.69]I need chairs and slots.
[210:29.07]Lamps.
[210:30.71]There's got to be a weird fucked up lamp.
[210:37.79]That's not bad.
[210:39.17]Can that be on the ground?
[210:45.68]Wall lights.
[210:48.72]Put mirrors on the walls.
[210:50.45]Make a funhouse.
[210:57.59]Why did you pick the poop-colored table?
[210:59.80]I don't know.
[211:01.68]Make a funhouse.
[211:03.10]Mirror.
[211:15.93]Oh, shit.
[211:26.11]No, this is gonna be fucked up.
[211:30.23]Make a mirror ma- Make a mirror maze?
[211:36.14]It's gonna be impossible to find my way out.
[211:46.99]This is going to be so trippy.
[211:48.33]This is going to suck.
[211:58.94]This kind of looks good.
[212:00.52]It does kind of look good, weirdly enough.
[212:13.40]How quickly would you go crazy if all your walls are mirrors?
[212:17.54]He's a vampire?
[212:19.34]But I thought vampires weren't supposed to be able to see the reflection.
[212:23.75]Oh.
[212:24.31]Yes.
[212:25.27]Yes.
[212:25.57]This shit's gonna take forever.
[212:33.97]This is gonna take forever.
[212:45.60]This is where I'm... Okay.
[212:46.58]This is where I just come to meditate.
[212:48.84]You look like you're playing a Wolfenstein level.
[213:19.66]I got plenty of money, right?
[213:28.77]You, what do you mean stop?
[213:29.67]You, I didn't, what do you mean ruin?
[213:30.93]I didn't ruin anything.
[213:37.45]Stop, stop, stop, uneven, fix it.
[213:40.33]This is just a first draft.
[213:58.43]There.
[213:59.85]I got it.
[214:00.21]I fixed it.
[214:02.13]I fixed it.
[214:02.67]Are there any bigger fucking mirrors?
[214:15.53]Seriously.
[214:16.03]Are there bigger mirrors?
[214:16.79]This is gonna take... This is horrible.
[214:18.27]This is just like a solar-paneled basement.
[214:21.14]Which makes no sense.
[214:22.36]What, are you coming in with a flashlight and shine it at him?
[214:27.32]What are you doing?
[214:32.47]You're just that guy that's super into solar.
[214:33.99]Yeah, you know, I got solar.
[214:35.85]I got solar literally everywhere.
[214:37.89]I got it in my fucking bathroom.
[214:39.27]It powers my toothbrushes, my toilets, my lights.
[214:47.05]I don't even have a roof anymore.
[214:48.53]I took the roof off and the sun just shines on all these panels.
[215:00.92]Okay.
[215:01.74]We're getting there.
[215:06.00]This is like a room you pay to get into.
[215:08.26]This is like a fun room, right?
[215:18.58]This is the anti-5G room.
[215:20.26]This is the 5G room.
[215:26.68]This is one of those rooms where you go in and you just shine a single laser pointer at the wall.
[215:34.89]And he'd probably kill you.
[215:37.63]It was just gonna ricochet off like 500 mirrors.
[215:39.57]It's gonna kill you Nice totally spies logic
[216:14.67]That's so funny.
[216:18.08]Okay, I'm not going to do the whole house like this.
[216:20.90]That would be so painful to me.
[216:23.88]It would cause me physical pain, I think.
[216:26.17]I can't do the whole house.
[216:36.10]Look at how good it looks.
[216:37.26]That's not going to look good upstairs.
[216:40.50]Get the bigger mirror.
[216:52.27]Okay, this is the mirror house.
[216:53.97]This is the mirror house, the mirror house.
[216:55.13]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[216:56.09]Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[217:04.52]I want the bed I sleep on to be a mirror.
[217:17.90]No.
[217:20.08]Big.
[217:20.56]Somebody said there's a big mirror.
[217:28.90]I think that's the biggest mirror you can get.
[217:33.39]Mirror module?
[217:36.74]No, it's as big as it gets.
[217:40.76]There's no large or anything.
[217:42.36]Wait.
[217:43.22]Oh.
[217:45.80]Mirror Lamont.
[217:47.97]Mirror module.
[217:51.43]No, I can't.
[217:52.19]This is as big as I can make it.
[217:58.84]There's more?
[218:06.36]Check all mirrors.
[218:11.94]No, there's no... I mean, here's mirror.
[218:16.26]This is not even that much bigger.
[218:21.44]On the left.
[218:22.18]Hold on.
[218:22.68]I'm getting spammed.
[218:24.46]What is this?
[218:29.11]Mr. Slime is playing... Yeah.
[218:31.63]No, that's not what it's going to look like.
[218:33.27]That's not what it's going to look like.
[218:35.63]Not what it's going to look like, guys.
[218:36.85]Sorry.
[218:42.34]There's a mirror category.
[218:53.66]Where's the mirror category?
[219:00.93]Old-fashioned mirror.
[219:03.01]Mirror.
[219:05.11]Mirror.
[219:09.00]I don't think this is bigger.
[219:09.88]I don't say mirror.
[219:27.03]I don't think it's big enough.
[219:32.79]Well, I'm going to keep going with what I was doing.
[219:42.33]I hate this.
[219:42.97]I'm only doing one room like this.
[219:45.01]I'm never gonna open it.
[219:45.75]I don't even care what's in here.
[219:48.81]I'm only finishing this room because I have to.
[220:05.16]By size.
[220:05.80]Uh...
[220:11.47]Sort by size.
[220:12.91]Sort by... Oldest.
[220:15.17]Descending.
[220:15.81]Alphabetical.
[220:16.43]Price.
[220:16.75]You can't sort by size.
[220:18.27]What are you... What's with this debate?
[220:28.38]Okay, I'm done with this shit.
[220:30.28]I'm just gonna put a bunch of weird lights so the ricochet's off and I'd have to dodge the laser.
[220:45.62]I also kind of feel like this is gonna break the game.
[220:48.14]If I turn a light on in here... I think that's... the game's gonna probably crash.
[220:58.36]Mirror modules connect.
[221:11.75]Oh no.
[221:14.67]No.
[221:15.17]No, no, no, no, no.
[221:19.97]No, I- I can't do- the whole house is a mirror.
[221:25.76]We're gonna be here for so long, you know how long that's gonna take?
[221:28.70]It's gonna be like a portal gun house.
[221:32.50]Oh shit, okay.
[221:34.35]Alright, I'm sorry everybody that's not gonna want this to happen.
[221:38.75]I'm sorry everybody!
[221:41.09]I'm sorry.
[221:44.29]Even the outside is going to be a mirror.
[221:49.55]I'm going to get lost.
[222:00.16]Oh, Jesus.
[222:01.02]This is bad.
[222:01.58]Oh, no.
[222:14.14]Do I put obstacles in the way?
[222:15.46]I wish I could control Z. I'm not going to run out of money, right?
[222:35.55]This is one of those absurd custom houses that you will never sell.
[222:40.69]Ever.
[222:41.49]Ever.
[222:43.48]You're going to have to demolish this house.
[222:49.95]Oh, HGTV presents interesting houses.
[222:54.21]Better be your permanent residence.
[223:01.36]Yeah, you know, we decided on having full mirrors just so I can kind of see everything.
[223:07.34]Always make sure like nothing was wrong in the house.
[223:13.00]Why is it Kermit?
[223:13.76]Man, I got ten voices.
[223:22.13]I really got a lot of inspiration from insects.
[223:25.65]You know, they have like a hundred eyes.
[223:28.95]Trying to mimic that in my real life.
[223:35.08]I mean, I get a little nauseous.
[223:36.54]I get a little nauseous, but it's worth it.
[223:46.19]Peeing's hard though.
[223:52.13]I can't tell if the toilet I'm peeing into is the real one or one of the mirrors.
[223:57.92]Hard to pee.
[224:00.80]But what I did is I just turned the whole bottom into a urinal.
[224:04.04]This bathtub works pretty well.
[224:10.90]Nine more voices to go.
[224:12.60]That's right.
[224:18.88]I have to paint that gray If you stood in the middle, okay, if you put like a light in the middle of this room I really would be afraid I would get electrocuted
[224:44.86]You can move it to the left.
[224:45.92]No, look, I can't.
[224:47.00]See?
[224:48.48]I can't.
[224:50.28]Can't do it.
[224:58.13]Question is, can I do this instead?
[225:02.11]Yup.
[225:03.79]Yup.
[225:04.97]It can be fixed.
[225:16.36]Hey, at least I'll be able to stand anywhere in my house while the main character comes in and I get to go... That's cool.
[225:30.55]I get to do that.
[225:42.21]I lost.
[225:44.85]No, I can't do it.
[225:54.70]Shit.
[226:01.75]This is already freaking me out.
[226:07.43]We're not even like a tenth of the way there.
[226:10.85]But what happens if... Guys, guys.
[226:16.02]I'm in trouble.
[226:22.70]Oh, I don't like this.
[226:23.42]This hurts.
[226:24.48]I don't like this.
[226:42.63]Your house is going to be invisible.
[226:52.05]These need to be lower.
[226:53.61]I can't even fit these here.
[226:54.81]Uh, yes I can actually.
[226:59.07]Excuse me.
[227:00.43]What are you talking about?
[227:01.31]What do you mean you can't fit it there?
[227:07.38]I can't fit it here!
[227:11.08]Shit.
[227:14.58]Remove the window.
[227:16.02]You can't remove windows.
[227:17.18]It's impossible.
[227:21.50]Break the top first.
[227:25.58]I can't.
[227:26.90]This is part of the structure.
[227:30.59]What weird cartoon doors can I have?
[227:37.07]That's pretty mirror-esque.
[227:38.61]That's pretty much a mirror.
[228:01.06]Make mini golf.
[228:02.96]I'll do the outside.
[228:16.83]Can I make a normal house?
[228:19.09]Can I make a normal house?
[228:23.27]When can I make a normal house?
[228:25.37]Can I do that?
[228:35.63]Oh, Jesus.
[228:37.27]Okay.
[228:38.39]I'm just gonna get this done.
[228:39.23]I'm gonna get this done.
[228:41.85]Get it done.
[228:42.25]Get it done.
[228:42.57]Get it done.
[228:42.89]Get it done.
[228:48.77]Get to work.
[228:49.53]What do you think I'm doing?
[228:50.77]The mirror thing was your idea.
[229:06.26]Was?
[229:08.90]No, it wasn't.
[229:09.60]Was it?
[229:11.62]No, somebody else said, hey, dude, put mirrors everywhere.
[229:14.60]Oh, come on.
[229:18.44]Stop it.
[229:21.42]It was you.
[229:29.81]Alright, hold on, hold on.
[229:30.77]We're going, we're going, we're going, we're going, we're going, we're going.
[229:34.57]I can't put them there.
[229:41.41]When I actually stand in the middle of this room, somebody's actually going to puke.
[229:44.94]I need to make a really, really fair warning.
[229:49.00]Here's your warning now.
[229:51.12]When I stand in the middle of the room when this is done, and there's furniture and lights in here, one of you is going to throw up.
[229:59.35]I just want to make sure that you know that now.
[230:16.55]go faster than this come on can't think on the bright side you're going to be immortalized as the genius streamer who created the mirror house uh you probably should put mirror in quotes
[230:48.39]It's misaligned.
[230:49.23]It's never going to be aligned right.
[230:55.11]I'm going to paint it the same color.
[230:56.27]Don't worry.
[231:00.89]Security system?
[231:02.39]Fuck it.
[231:03.37]Don't need it.
[231:03.79]We don't need lights yet.
[231:16.00]Oh, I already hate it.
[231:19.34]Oh, I hate it.
[231:20.03]It's not even done.
[231:20.63]I don't like it.
[231:21.21]I don't like it.
[231:22.73]I don't like it.
[231:23.33]I don't like it.
[231:23.79]I don't like it.
[231:24.37]I really don't.
[231:25.05]I don't like it.
[231:29.07]Something in my body just wanted to just recoil backwards and scream.
[231:36.29]This is a good idea because the burglar can't find your shit now.
[231:41.85]I mean, that's, yeah, you got that right.
[231:47.52]That makes sense.
[231:50.03]But, um, have fun stubbing your toe on every single thing in your house.
[231:55.95]And I don't mean just, like, stubbing your toe once.
[231:57.95]I mean every single item.
[232:00.67]You're gonna constantly be in a state of just disarray.
[232:04.88]You're gonna bump into the couch.
[232:06.00]You're gonna hit your head on the fucking ceiling lights and shit.
[232:08.58]It's gonna be bad.
[232:13.70]I don't think I could... I don't think you could pay me enough money to live in this house.
[232:25.18]This would start to really, really get to me in a week.
[232:52.43]Remember, the music's driving me insane.
[232:54.99]What should I put on instead?
[233:01.33]Ceiling mirrors?
[233:02.75]You can't do ceiling mirrors.
[233:08.30]The only thing that we have to escape is to stare at the ground or stare at the ceiling.
[233:16.90]Can't fit him here.
[233:19.02]Why not?
[233:19.52]What?
[233:22.32]Bullshit.
[233:25.72]Put on Luigi's Mansion?
[233:29.76]That's not a bad idea.
[233:41.21]Oh, God.
[233:47.29]I'd prefer it to be like this.
[233:55.37]Is that real?
[233:56.09]Which one's real?
[233:56.73]Alright, yeah, this is horror music.
[234:03.19]I'll turn the horror music off.
[234:04.30]Okay, there we go.
[234:09.64]Horror music off.
[234:12.10]And Luigi's Mansion OST.
[234:13.76]Okay.
[234:20.76]Okay.
[234:36.15]Oh, remember that sound?
[234:44.97]Loud.
[234:47.21]Okay, that's not bad.
[235:01.08]For a second I thought, wait, if I do mirrors here too, right?
[235:05.27]Is it gonna work the way that I think it is?
[235:06.65]Is this not even lined up?
[235:20.80]What?
[235:26.42]Is the OST really the opening cutscene?
[235:28.46]Let's be honest.
[235:35.81]That just scared the shit out of me.
[235:46.96]Hello?
[235:52.82]Hello?
[235:57.82]Here it comes.
[236:06.54]Right?
[236:07.84]This is the song, right?
[236:09.40]This doesn't look right.
[236:10.72]Why does it look so off?
[236:13.62]Oh, okay.
[236:14.54]Um...
[236:40.61]Okay, what is a hundred gex?
[236:42.35]Everyone, I see that all the time.
[236:43.87]What's a hundred gex?
[236:54.46]Shit, it doesn't fit.
[237:22.49]I can't, what, I cannot believe I'm doing this.
[237:24.73]But, it's, I can't back out now.
[237:26.80]If I back out now, then it's a failure.
[237:29.66]I can't back out.
[237:30.60]I have to do it.
[237:44.23]Oh, mama mia!
[237:50.49]The game's having trouble rendering the actual... You know what it looks like?
[237:58.13]It just looks like the game hasn't loaded all the assets in the house yet.
[238:02.28]It just looks blurry and fucked up.
[238:20.31]Check settings to make better reflections.
[238:22.99]Well, hold on one step at a time.
[238:25.77]One step at a time.
[238:27.01]We're almost done with the first floor.
[238:42.90]Luigi.
[238:44.82]It's already starting to have problems.
[238:46.22]Okay, let's do... Alright.
[238:48.29]Alright.
[238:50.46]I can build a wall here.
[238:51.32]Wait, I can just do that over there, too.
[239:02.78]This house is going to give me Mercury poisoning.
[239:10.80]Mercury house.
[239:13.60]We need just flat... Alright, this is where I really blew it, okay?
[239:18.02]This is how I blew it.
[239:20.11]We just need one full thing across.
[239:24.64]I fucked it all up by needing the- Like, just like this, a straight line across.
[239:41.35]Restart?
[239:45.28]I'll show you how you restart.
[239:48.35]You just pretend this vault doesn't exist behind me.
[239:55.11]Hold R. Building distance is one meter more.
[240:02.87]Oh, cool.
[240:15.91]This reminds me of Earthbound.
[240:18.36]I get Earthbound vibes from this.
[240:19.70]Let's go.
[240:33.36]I'm ready.
[240:46.58]Don't make mistakes.
[240:47.32]It takes longer.
[240:48.80]It takes longer if you make a goddamn mistake.
[240:52.84]Just get it right.
[241:03.47]Fuck!
[241:11.92]What a... This is riveting gameplay here.
[241:15.32]Like, holy shit, this is unbelievable.
[241:21.12]What did you do on your Wednesday afternoon?
[241:23.06]I watched a crazy guy mirror every wall in his house.
[241:30.37]Uh, dude, just, um, like, you ghosted me.
[241:36.75]Would you rather do that than, like, hang out with me?
[241:41.01]Yeah.
[241:41.31]Alright.
[241:50.08]Sorry, dude.
[241:59.46]And, like, you know what, man?
[242:02.28]Lose my number.
[242:02.96]I just... I'm just gonna take this opportunity right now.
[242:07.04]Like, we just don't... We don't, like, see eye to eye on anything.
[242:11.98]And... You're kind of like a dick, man.
[242:15.50]Like, I've just... I'll talk to you later.
[242:24.18]This is gonna make my house look way bigger.
[242:26.50]No, it's not.
[242:28.74]This is just what the house looked like without the mirror wall.
[242:34.76]I'm giving myself an illusion to a house that exists behind this wall.
[242:44.48]Why?
[243:00.61]Infinite house.
[243:02.52]Infinite housing.
[243:09.24]Alright, okay.
[243:09.90]I'm making a house.
[243:10.62]I'm making a house.
[243:11.66]I'm making a house.
[243:12.18]I'm done.
[243:12.99]I have to stop doing this now.
[243:16.23]My sanity is at stake at the moment.
[243:18.77]Like, I don't want to do this.
[243:23.61]This is stupid.
[243:26.91]But, like, I could make a big... Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[243:34.27]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[243:36.81]I know what I have to do.
[243:37.82]I know what I have to do.
[243:38.58]I know what I have to do.
[243:45.02]I'm in too deep?
[243:45.76]Yeah, I am.
[243:51.49]Hmm.
[243:54.03]Oh, son of a bitch.
[244:10.67]This is sunk cost fallacy.
[244:14.28]Turn up reflections.
[244:17.94]Okay.
[244:18.62]Graphics.
[244:20.66]Brightness.
[244:21.10]Graphics API.
[244:22.84]Brightness.
[244:23.24]Field of view.
[244:23.80]What the fuck is this doing here?
[244:26.71]Resolution.
[244:27.73]Advanced.
[244:29.01]Shadows.
[244:32.23]Screen space reflection.
[244:35.79]Is that what you want?
[244:36.96]Motion blur.
[244:38.06]Fog.
[244:41.45]Extreme?
[244:42.89]Extreme quality.
[245:04.67]Dude, what are you doing?
[245:05.51]Monsters are gonna spawn in the gap!
[245:09.03]This ain't Minecraft, man.
[245:28.97]He said M. He said monsters.
[245:31.19]He said the M word.
[245:39.08]God.
[245:39.44]Okay, so... I'm just curious to see what happens, okay?
[245:55.02]Let me just... Give me one second.
[246:00.20]Furniture.
[246:01.42]I'm just gonna put a chair in here.
[246:02.70]Okay?
[246:04.74]Just a swivel chair.
[246:37.56]Wait.
[246:39.70]Why is it on in the mirror world, but not on in the real world?
[246:42.42]Alright, let's keep going.
[246:57.33]Such a colossal waste of time.
[247:09.67]Jojo reference?
[247:12.44]What did I do?
[247:18.64]Actually, this is starting to take shape.
[247:20.92]Alright, never mind.
[247:21.60]Hold on.
[247:21.92]This is starting to take shape.
[247:41.53]Dude, is that a JoJo mirror?
[247:46.38]Oh, by the way, I saw an image of me on the internet.
[247:49.74]And... Somebody put, like, Pokémon sandals on me.
[247:53.72]People just doctor photos I'm in.
[247:56.32]People were so excited that I was wearing Pokémon sandals in this photo.
[247:59.96]And that's not real.
[248:01.25]Somebody put that in.
[248:02.05]I didn't do that.
[248:04.79]It's the only thing they doctored in the whole entire picture.
[248:15.92]Why is this upside down?
[248:17.06]This stream is gonna make somebody sick.
[248:47.78]Get out of here.
[248:50.26]This song is killing me.
[248:53.37]Get out.
[248:53.77]I have to get the fuck out.
[248:57.79]This song came on and it fucked up everything.
[249:03.40]Okay, get that off.
[249:04.52]I don't want to hear that one again.
[249:05.40]I don't want to hear that song ever again.
[249:26.06]Trapped in mirror hell.
[249:34.98]I'm gonna make you guys the home of my dreams.
[249:38.87]I'm gonna do that.
[249:40.79]I'm gonna start that shit after the mirror house.
[249:43.01]I'm getting this one out of the way so we can go to the mirror house out of here.
[249:48.65]It's not this.
[249:49.30]This is not the house of my dreams.
[250:02.06]I'm going to sell this one.
[250:02.88]There's a guy in the mirror.
[250:08.07]There is not a guy in the mirror.
[250:09.17]Who are you going to sell it to?
[250:19.32]Uh, Dolan.
[250:22.40]He's loaded and he doesn't care about any of his money.
[250:28.04]I could probably call Dolan on the phone.
[250:30.56]And say, hey, yo, Dolan.
[250:32.60]Um, can you buy my house for $400,000?
[250:35.16]And he'd just say yes and hang up.
[250:39.04]Yeah, I'll wire you the money immediately.
[250:41.11]Thanks, Dolan.
[250:41.65]I can always count on you.
[250:43.65]Yeah, hey, if you ever fuck up a whole house again, just let me know.
[250:45.93]If you, like, burn it down, you, like, put mirrors everywhere, or you fucking, like, torch it.
[250:48.93]Yeah, just let me know, man.
[250:49.95]I'll buy it for $500,000 every time.
[250:58.45]Do a Trump impression.
[251:02.29]Um... Why?
[251:22.16]I can't handle this anymore.
[251:40.52]This is fucking me up so bad.
[251:54.10]No, no, either finish Mirror House or you have to do a political stream.
[252:01.41]Um, how about I just say, uh, no.
[252:13.78]Yeah, I can't wait for Mr. Slimes to be like a political streamer.
[252:30.59]Do it.
[252:30.93]I'm not gonna... I'm kidding.
[252:32.09]Fast Jerma versus Purple Alien.
[252:41.21]Oh, that's the music from Fast Jerma, Purple Alien?
[252:45.04]Is it really?
[252:45.48]Nice.
[252:52.54]This is when you catch a ghost.
[252:53.56]I know this one.
[253:03.43]Okay, I'm... I don't even want to go over there.
[253:12.33]You guys gave me Luigi's Mansion soundtrack, and it's... It's the worst possible soundtrack to listen to right now.
[253:23.46]Oh, I'm going to lose my mind.
[253:36.85]Is Luigi's Mansion 2 any good?
[253:39.18]Or is it just three?
[253:40.56]Only play three in one.
[253:41.50]Why are they disappearing?
[253:44.38]I think I'm running out of asset space.
[253:57.02]Yeah, he's getting a little sloppy.
[253:58.30]He's getting a little sloppy.
[253:59.18]He is.
[254:00.34]He's getting sloppy.
[254:07.05]I have to start to move.
[254:08.19]I have to move.
[254:09.21]I seriously have to move.
[254:11.73]I can't look at that anymore.
[254:13.09]Okay.
[254:22.25]He's going psycho.
[254:26.07]I'm kind of mad.
[254:27.01]It's like this is difficult to do and not have like a freak out.
[254:37.26]okay alright alright that's fun that was fun let's put some furniture in my house let's do uh lights furniture I want a couch I want one of these cool things right uh right here
[255:06.93]More mirrors.

[255:16.38]Finish the stairs, but hold on a second.
[255:30.43]Fucking crack music, I swear to God.
[255:33.55]Furniture.
[255:35.57]I need to put on a dining room table over here.
[255:45.20]It's just a dining room or a kitchen.
[255:54.54]Okay, we'll put the
[256:11.58]I can't.
[256:11.90]I gotta go.
[256:12.26]I gotta go.
[256:12.60]I have to stop.
[256:13.34]Stop.
[256:13.58]Stop.
[256:13.76]Turn it off.
[256:14.14]Turn the music off.
[256:14.90]Turn the fucking music off.
[256:15.76]Turn the music off.
[256:17.79]Turn off the music.
[256:18.53]Okay.
[256:42.18]I need ceiling lights.
[256:47.60]Humanity restored.
[256:48.76]I want to just make a house.
[256:57.11]Why do I have to do this?
[257:01.69]I could have just easily made a house with a TV and
[257:13.10]Alright.
[257:14.80]Here we go.
[257:29.44]Oh, I can't.
[257:30.14]I can't look at it.
[257:31.20]I can't look at it.
[258:07.88]Oh my god, I'm trapped in a nightmare.
[258:18.38]It's a fucking nightmare house.
[258:27.36]TV?
[258:28.02]What's big?
[258:28.90]A bed?
[258:43.35]Put it in a disco ball?
[258:46.09]I'm actually going to move on.
[258:48.48]This is going to kill me.
[258:51.20]I have to stop doing this.
[258:53.02]Why can I not stop doing this?
[259:02.84]Why do I want this to crash?
[259:05.92]Why do I want this to break?
[259:13.56]I'm gonna turn off some of the lights.
[259:15.06]Some of them.
[259:15.58]Only a few of them.
[259:44.46]I feel like this is what it would be like if I was in a human fish tank.
[259:51.35]You know how we put shit in a fish tank?
[259:54.37]Just like, uh, fish like coral and a little castle.
[260:01.22]Human.
[260:01.74]Plant a computer sofa and a chair.
[260:06.24]Oh, now I know where I am.
[260:07.64]I know my surroundings.
[260:13.57]I just open up my mouth and just, like, meat just falls down.
[260:19.60]Human fish tank.
[260:25.86]This looks like a bank.
[260:29.08]This looks normal.
[260:30.38]Like, it looks like a bank.
[260:42.38]What would you classify as odd?
[260:43.90]It looks like a bank.
[260:52.57]Get rid of it!
[260:53.13]Get rid of it!
[260:53.53]I don't even want to look at it.
[260:59.98]Why did I put that up there to taunt myself?
[261:01.66]Alright, I'm making a- I'm selling this house.
[261:03.22]I don't want it anymore.
[261:04.14]Sell this fucking thing.
[261:06.38]Sell it.
[261:06.78]I don't want it.
[261:07.43]I don't want this.
[261:08.03]I'm done.
[261:09.99]Sell the house, please.
[261:10.93]I don't- I'm gonna make a real house.
[261:13.29]No more messing around.
[261:14.11]No more, like, joke- shitty joke shit.
[261:16.89]No, I'm not making a bowling alley.
[261:18.29]I'm not making a movie theater.
[261:19.57]Although there could be a cool, sick theater in there.
[261:23.31]Auction it.
[261:23.61]I don't want it.
[261:23.99]Put a disco ball.
[261:34.32]This is actually going for a lot.
[261:35.54]Is it the mirrors?
[261:38.32]Holy shit!
[261:51.02]Fuck the disco ball.
[261:52.04]I'm just taking it.
[262:21.45]Why is it taking so many pictures?
[262:22.67]You know the house is fucked up.
[262:24.37]I got a tip for you guys.
[262:25.79]When the realtor is only taking pictures of the same room from 10 different angles, probably might want to skip that one.
[262:38.74]When they just show you a photo of the outside of the house and one of the bathrooms, and you know that it's like 1,400 square feet, don't go to that one.
[262:54.24]And look at that.
[262:55.80]Don't go to this one.
[262:57.74]But Dolan just buys every house, so who cares?
[263:00.57]He has a grand scheme.
[263:02.57]Where he's going to own all the property in whatever town this is.
[263:06.57]And he's going to be a mogul.
[263:10.96]Do they update this game a lot?
[263:14.34]From what I gather, I believe so.
[263:21.92]There's been at least two or three major, major updates to this game in the last couple of years, right?
[263:25.78]Okay, I'm doing a real house.
[263:30.06]Real house.
[263:31.82]No more messing around.
[263:33.88]I'm gonna get a real house, and I'm gonna make it the way that I would, I would, my dream home, okay?
[263:41.62]I have to do this.
[263:48.97]Which one do I want, though?
[263:58.19]Family house?
[263:59.99]Man cave?
[264:04.40]Ooh, yeah.
[264:05.42]Alright, let's do the man cave.
[264:09.38]Let's go.
[264:10.36]I'm ready.
[264:11.22]I'm sorry, I just punched you in the face.
[264:12.44]I'm ready.
[264:21.79]What are we working with here?
[264:28.48]Oof.
[264:31.48]Okay.
[264:32.22]This is coming down.
[264:33.50]What's this for?
[264:34.84]World's best dad.
[264:35.85]Well, we know who lived here before.
[264:38.99]It's a reddit house.
[264:40.51]I gotta have the streaming room.
[264:43.13]Okay.
[264:43.95]This is gonna be my garage.
[264:46.63]It is a garage.
[264:47.23]Right.
[264:47.97]Here's the streamer room.
[264:49.58]I'm gonna make my exact fucking room.
[264:56.80]This is the reddit house.
[265:00.64]What a huge fucking yard.
[265:03.06]Alright, we're gonna go outside first.
[265:04.92]Get a spray can.
[265:13.07]Make Otto's room.
[265:17.39]I need to cut the lawn.
[265:25.24]Should I have a little tomato garden back here?
[265:27.00]Yup.
[265:36.63]Use the lawnmower.
[265:37.41]I don't have one.
[265:45.81]I don't have a lawnmower.
[265:46.67]Where do I get it?
[265:49.97]Flamethrower.
[265:53.34]Oh, I can burn the grass.
[265:54.30]You're right.
[265:54.66]I have to buy one in the store.
[265:58.12]I'm out of fuel.
[265:59.28]Okay, fuel for the flamethrower.
[266:08.40]Okay.
[266:12.41]Refueled.
[266:19.11]That's so much faster than mowing the lawn.
[266:28.67]And I pull the goggles down and look over.
[266:30.77]Hey, Tim!
[266:38.08]It's a hot one today!
[266:55.34]You're killing the grass.
[267:00.40]Oops!
[267:02.64]It's okay, Jim!
[267:04.56]Nolan will fix it!
[267:07.71]I didn't want that shit anyways, who wants that?
[267:25.98]This is so much faster!
[267:27.26]This is so much faster!
[267:32.26]Why clean when you can just burn your house down?
[267:41.79]You're the neighbor looking in here.
[267:45.45]Oh my god!
[267:47.31]Mike's finally lost his mind?
[268:01.58]I'm just taking care of some yard work.
[268:02.86]Uh, you know, by the way, uh, Jim.
[268:11.69]That tree's kind of hanging a little bit far over on my side of the property, don't you think?
[268:19.35]By the way, flip us around and pretend I'm you saying that.
[268:22.56]What I meant to say was, I'll take care of it.
[268:32.10]I did it in the reverse way.
[268:34.96]You get it, Jim.
[268:35.74]You get it.
[268:36.26]We're buddies.
[268:36.84]We know each other.
[268:47.08]He's mirror mad.
[268:48.18]Oh wait, I am actually killing all the grass.
[269:06.33]I am, I actually am.
[269:07.79]Axe not available yet, what?
[269:14.20]What you don't understand is when you do it this way, you never have to have a lawn.
[269:17.10]You never have to mow the lawn.
[269:18.40]Never have to cut the grass.
[269:19.60]Never have to take care of it.
[269:20.96]Ever.
[269:26.81]It's just gone.
[269:35.01]I thought this was going to take like two hours to do this out here.
[269:37.11]Nope.
[269:38.17]This is so much quicker.
[269:45.57]WM1.
[269:47.86]Lawnmower.
[269:55.68]Wait, why am I adding grass?
[270:12.66]Yo, you melted the driveway.
[270:14.13]Oh, oh, oh, okay.
[270:45.92]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[270:47.40]I mean... This is very important.
[271:01.05]Give me one second.
[271:01.85]Okay, I just need this.
[271:11.88]This is important for me to do this.
[271:16.07]Hold on.
[271:22.48]Where is it?
[271:26.36]I need, I need the crit sound.
[271:28.16]Okay, we're good.
[271:38.49]I need to be able to press this a shitload of times.
[271:45.66]Here we go.
[271:54.64]Okay.
[271:55.04]We're good.
[271:57.54]Give me one sec.
[271:58.36]I'm just gonna add this to my stream deck.
[272:06.45]This is gonna be a audio... Random crits, yeah.
[272:11.67]The Backburner.
[272:13.13]I'm backburnering my house.
[272:22.09]Okay.
[272:25.97]Play audio.
[272:28.99]Audio comes from... I just downloaded it.
[272:32.35]There it is.
[272:40.78]Where did that download to?
[272:41.84]Shit!
[272:42.34]Hold on.
[272:45.24]Is it on desktop?
[272:47.42]It's on desktop, desktop, desktop, desktop, desktop, desktop, desktop, desktop.
[272:51.48]There it is.
[272:52.04]Okay, here we go.
[272:53.26]Let's test it.
[272:54.86]It works.
[273:00.13]Okay, this is play.
[273:01.27]No fade.
[273:05.33]Alright.
[273:06.77]And let's go ahead and start to play the game.
[273:22.85]I'm playing!
[273:28.72]God.
[273:33.08]Hey, champ!
[273:47.13]Not the house!
[273:56.76]Oh shit!
[273:57.30]The new pyro update!
[273:58.44]The fucking hose!
[274:05.89]You gotta land it directly on their fucking head.
[274:09.75]Nice!
[274:11.17]I love this fucking target map.
[274:12.17]Why don't they add this?
[274:17.22]That'd be awesome!
[274:18.00]If there was like a water spray can?
[274:31.28]Alright, what was I doing?
[274:32.38]What was I doing?
[274:33.04]Flamethrower.
[274:55.88]Not bad.
[274:57.00]This was going to take so long.
[275:01.77]Not anymore.
[275:03.59]How come this doesn't take off the graffiti?
[275:08.57]I'm gonna pave the whole backyard anyways, don't worry.
[275:10.58]This is supposed to be my dream high man cave.
[275:16.58]There's gonna be four basketball courts.
[275:18.32]Of course it leaves the grass.
[275:32.27]More muscle, that's cool.
[275:36.81]I missed a spot.
[275:37.63]I know, I'm gonna get it.
[275:38.71]I'm actually probably better off.
[275:47.10]Okay, it's ready to be cleaned.
[275:55.62]I'm probably better off just using the actual mower now.
[276:04.41]It must be burned.
[276:15.18]Alright, look at that.
[276:16.48]It was so overgrown with vegetation and now it looks great.
[276:21.12]It looks flat.
[276:22.08]Need to get rid of this in the front.
[276:26.70]Not that much more.
[276:34.09]This doesn't want to get destroyed for some reason.
[276:40.66]Minigolf.
[276:41.54]Oh, yeah.
[276:42.22]Yeah!
[276:42.58]I'll do this later.
[276:45.78]I've got to clean.
[277:00.99]Keep world's best dad.
[277:04.85]Maybe.
[277:06.15]Maybe.
[277:06.61]No.
[277:13.00]Okay, that's fine.
[277:13.98]Gotta clean the windows.
[277:15.68]This is just so messed up, it's gonna need a complete overhaul.
[277:40.73]There is something about... No one will ever be able to replicate this.
[277:44.27]TF2 did this.
[277:46.45]The way that you felt after hearing that sequence of crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit.
[277:57.34]Something about it.
[277:58.64]It was the most... It was like dopamine just flooding into your brain.
[278:06.27]No game will ever be able to... I don't think we'll ever be able to make that feel like that again.
[278:13.65]When you shot two crit rockets in a row in TF2, nothing can replace that.
[278:24.27]Especially if you did it into like a little corridor and you knew there's like six people in there and it was just, it just went like this.
[278:28.82]You just heard it.
[278:30.28]You'd go, it was like, whoa, look at the kill.
[278:36.78]I got six people.
[278:38.45]It was amazing.
[278:46.91]Being on the receiving end of that, though, was, like, uninstall TF2.
[278:51.25]Why are there random crits?
[278:52.55]This game's... Nice job, Valve.
[278:54.88]Random crits, huh?
[279:04.26]Air this place out.
[279:09.14]Like, you would hear that noise.
[279:11.13]No, you would not hear that noise.
[279:12.29]You didn't even get to hear it.
[279:13.37]That's the worst part.
[279:14.79]If you get hit by a random crit, you don't even get to hear the cool noise.
[279:16.89]You just explode.
[279:17.49]Does it play fall, guys?
[279:27.48]No, not right now.
[279:35.56]Okay, world's best dad.
[279:37.18]Can I...
[279:47.56]I don't think I can go around this.
[279:50.46]I mean, I guess I could put... I could put a bureau here and just block this out until it's just World's Best Dad.
[280:06.67]Play Mario Maker.
[280:07.55]Didn't I make... I made like a Mario Maker reference today.
[280:11.94]What was it?
[280:13.62]I don't remember what it was.
[280:16.67]Like, oh yeah, Mario Maker.
[280:18.41]Why did I say that earlier?
[280:19.47]It was yesterday.
[280:27.82]Egomaniac streamer thinks he's the best at.
[280:34.90]That was a good game.
[280:35.76]You were calling your fake friend.
[280:37.89]Oh, right, right, okay.
[280:49.33]Good?
[280:52.13]Wildest loser thinks he can make a better dad than anyone.
[280:55.41]I think I'd be okay.
[281:01.56]I think I'd be a pretty good dad.
[281:05.00]KSO every night!
[281:14.07]That's not a cool dad?
[281:24.01]I have a funny story for you.
[281:28.50]So, we gave Otto this new food because of his Addison's and we're trying to get him on some better food and different food.
[281:40.96]So, I've been giving it to him and a friend of mine was here.
[281:48.43]And the friend of mine saw me put this fresh dog food into his bowl.
[281:56.03]And he thought I was giving the dog queso.
[281:59.57]He really thought that's what it was.
[282:00.74]He was like, what are you doing?
[282:06.22]It's in this weird package that you dump it out.
[282:09.80]He was just like, why are you feeding your dog queso?
[282:14.22]And something about, like, that was just making me fucking die laughing.
[282:17.88]I'm like, why would somebody do that?
[282:22.32]Just give your dog queso every day.
[282:24.62]Like, that's fucking insane.
[282:26.90]Like, why do you think I was doing this?
[282:33.79]There's already a man cave down here.
[282:35.19]I can't even make it mine.
[282:35.93]Is that a picture of Elvis?
[282:38.63]Who is that a picture of?
[282:39.37]I don't know.
[282:44.13]Oh, lucky.
[282:45.83]Lucky.
[282:51.74]No, this man cave's not... I don't even want this stuff.
[283:00.22]This is my stand-up comedy studio.
[283:01.78]It's where I practice all my new jokes.
[283:18.20]What are you doing?
[283:18.76]Take it out.
[283:21.57]Any golf?
[283:23.31]Yeah, yeah.
[283:23.81]We gotta clean this place up a little bit first.
[283:27.47]What's wrong here?
[283:31.47]Why is there... Why is there, like, consecration on the walls?
[283:36.03]Does that do anything?
[283:48.66]Did I get it?
[283:49.08]Oh, what?
[283:54.77]I can't remove these.
[283:55.57]I burnt it all, that's why.
[283:56.79]I cannot remove these.
[284:06.66]That's annoying.
[284:07.12]Alright, the house is clean.
[284:14.63]There's one more piece.
[284:17.15]It's right here somewhere.
[284:18.23]I can't... Where is it?
[284:18.97]Did I get it?
[284:24.34]Okay.
[284:26.08]Cool.
[284:26.96]What color does the house... Is the house going to be?
[284:29.78]What color does the house want to be?
[284:33.02]I'm thinking... Make it purple?
[284:42.86]Make it a mirror.
[284:43.52]No, we're not doing that again.
[284:46.59]Not happening.
[284:47.07]Okay, how about, what about walls?
[284:54.93]Uh, light colored medium panels.
[284:57.95]Pistachio?
[285:01.09]This is kind of, yeah, this is like a Rockwell's Modern Lifehouse.
[285:03.15]I'll try this.
[285:16.96]Yeah, alright.
[285:17.36]It's like Rocko's modern life.
[285:20.66]His house, the Rocko's modern life looked like this.
[285:22.72]It's a cartoon house.
[285:30.86]This is a 90s house.
[285:34.77]Oh, actually, I don't know.
[285:36.11]Is this supposed to be a dream house?
[285:47.44]I can't do that.
[285:47.92]I can't decide.
[285:48.38]Alright, this is a bathroom.
[285:53.30]Let me think of what I want when I walk in my house.
[285:55.33]Okay, I'm closing my eyes.
[285:57.35]Walk in.
[285:57.83]What am I looking at?
[286:00.81]Got a place to put my, like, keys.
[286:02.25]Right here.
[286:03.37]Okay.
[286:06.46]Kitchen right here.
[286:07.14]Yep.
[286:08.54]Okay, kitchen.
[286:12.28]This leads over to the... This is my little living room area.
[286:17.09]I don't know if I want the bathroom there.
[286:18.33]I don't know.
[286:20.41]There's only one bathroom?
[286:23.29]What is this place?
[286:26.40]Bedroom?
[286:28.54]Bedroom.
[286:28.96]Garage.
[286:29.60]Okay, garage.
[286:32.04]Down to here.
[286:32.74]Maybe this should be... Yeah, okay, stream.
[286:37.80]We'll start with the stream room.
[286:39.74]I'm gonna make the stream room that I want.
[286:43.33]Alright, stream room time.
[286:44.21]Here we go.
[286:47.40]Where is it?
[286:50.84]I need a stream room.
[286:51.52]This is bedroom.
[286:54.40]Bedroom?
[286:55.90]Bathroom?
[286:56.46]I need a stream room.
[287:00.50]Like the basement, the gamer room?
[287:03.66]No, no, no, no, I can't.
[287:04.88]No, no, it's gotta be a separate thing.
[287:09.78]Bedroom.
[287:10.98]Stream room.
[287:13.47]Basement for VR.
[287:18.05]Okay, yeah, we'll do this.
[287:18.83]We'll make a wall here.
[287:23.97]Kitchen.
[287:27.35]Where's the TV gonna go?
[287:28.58]This place is too small.
[287:29.54]TV here?
[287:34.88]Couch there?
[287:36.48]I think so.
[287:45.90]Just buy a bigger house.
[287:48.62]Well, I've already committed.
[287:49.60]Alright, so this is gonna be the stream room.
[288:16.52]The glass house?
[288:18.38]No, it's not.
[288:19.02]It's gonna be nice.
[288:21.62]Use the scroll wheel to make the sections larger.
[288:23.84]Thank you.
[288:25.44]Wow, you just saved me like a hundred years.
[288:27.24]Okay, now we need to make a door here.
[288:38.19]How big is it?
[288:38.63]One, two, three?
[288:45.15]That's good, right?
[288:50.93]The basement's gonna be sick.
[288:52.59]Don't worry.
[288:52.93]There's a streamer room.
[288:57.97]Okay, the desk is gonna go... Here.
[289:05.06]I have an L-shaped desk.
[289:09.68]And I've got the 1, 2, 3 monitors.
[289:11.36]Okay, let's go to... Let's type in desk.
[289:17.11]Desk.
[289:20.93]Hmm. No.
[289:23.93]Here we are. There we are.
[289:29.00]This is wallnut too.
[289:31.00]Already. It's the exact one.
[289:35.00]This is my desk.
[289:47.00]Wait that's wrong. What?
[289:50.52]Why does this feel incorrect?
[289:55.86]How would you sit here and touch the... It's like that, right?
[290:06.81]I want it to be like that.
[290:11.23]Shit, I can't... I built it the wrong way, whatever.
[290:16.00]Okay, there's that.
[290:16.52]I need to make, I need to get my fucking, my, my, my, my Office Max Quadro 4000.
[290:23.41]Spell it right, for God's sakes.
[290:31.63]Okay, chair.
[290:49.32]I mean, you have to.
[290:56.90]This is gigantic.
[290:59.04]How is this bigger than the desk?
[291:06.06]I don't know.
[291:06.38]Every time I see one of these, I honestly, I just think about it's going to lean back and a dentist is going to come in and just start drilling my teeth.
[291:18.26]Queso chair.
[291:22.56]Now we need monitors.
[291:24.10]Computer.
[291:27.20]What kind of computer do I have?
[291:32.89]Probably like this one.
[291:36.09]And it's under here.
[291:39.21]My computer sits under here.
[291:40.95]Okay.
[291:44.90]Okay.
[291:49.62]And then... What do you mean, what the fuck?
[291:52.74]Yes, it's on the floor.
[291:54.52]Underfloor, under the desk.
[291:56.08]On the other side.
[291:56.60]Alright, now we need monitor.
[292:03.35]Holy shit.
[292:08.47]I don't have that, though.
[292:10.23]That's me lying to you.
[292:11.09]I don't have that.
[292:19.00]Monitor HD.
[292:22.02]Not it either.
[292:30.06]Monitor... I just need little ones.
[292:32.51]I need to do my setup.
[292:35.61]There we are.
[292:36.05]Okay, here we go.
[292:36.59]Ready?
[292:42.07]This is what it looks like.
[292:43.13]I know people are being like, now you get a glimpse into my life.
[293:07.60]Three.
[293:07.90]Yeah, three.
[293:08.42]Alright, that's good.
[293:15.51]Where's the keyboard?
[293:17.45]I'm working on it.
[293:22.59]Backlit keyboard brushy.
[293:26.61]Oh, that's actually kind of scary.
[293:27.70]This is the one I use.
[293:33.70]Nice, okay.
[293:36.66]Now I need a mouse.
[293:40.19]Gaming mouse pad.
[293:46.05]And then a mouse.
[294:01.81]Okay.
[294:03.23]That looks good.
[294:03.87]And then what else is in here?
[294:04.69]There's a Reddit shelf behind me.
[294:17.98]This is pretty close.
[294:19.54]No, there's one that looks like this.
[294:21.50]Where is it?
[294:28.16]Sofas, tables, desks, chairs, beds, armchairs.
[294:32.67]Decorations?
[294:33.37]No.
[294:35.02]Where is it?
[294:35.46]It's not walls.
[294:43.18]Is it a bookcase?
[294:46.14]Installations?
[294:46.90]No.
[294:47.28]Decorations?
[294:49.46]Accessories?
[295:00.91]No.
[295:01.21]Where is it?
[295:02.98]Put a step stool in there.
[295:04.21]No, I don't think so.
[295:05.81]I mean, I would like to have a sauna.
[295:11.97]Books.
[295:16.69]Where?
[295:16.89]I've seen it.
[295:18.62]Where the hell is it?
[295:23.74]Oh, well.
[295:25.72]Oh, well.
[295:28.26]Mother?
[295:28.50]Whoa, what's this?
[295:34.74]Aquarium, that'd be cool.
[295:42.33]Shelf?
[295:42.75]Yeah, I... You'd think it would just show up under shelf.
[295:48.13]It looks like this, except it's kind of tilted.
[295:50.33]Oh well.
[295:55.90]This'll do.
[296:00.14]Furniture, furniture, furniture, furniture, furniture.
[296:03.06]Furniture!
[296:04.90]Furniture.
[296:13.66]I don't see furniture.
[296:17.17]Wait, I think this is it.
[296:18.27]Hold on.
[296:21.89]Yep, alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[296:22.97]You got it, you got it, you got it.
[296:24.23]It kind of looks like this one.
[296:39.85]Right?
[296:43.13]And then... Wait, we gotta put, like, a bunch of sound paneling all over the walls.
[296:48.67]First, I want to paint this lime green.
[296:56.91]Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[296:58.85]Spearmint green.
[297:03.19]Spearmint green.
[297:04.19]Okay, here we go.
[297:11.49]Oh, faded lemon.
[297:12.61]Not a bad choice.
[297:14.73]Spring grass.
[297:15.27]There it is.
[297:18.52]Oh, I love it.
[297:20.96]I love this color so much.
[297:22.52]It's just... It makes me feel so good.
[297:24.52]This is a little too dark.
[297:31.95]This is too dark.
[297:32.93]It has to be lighter than this, but this is as close as it's going to get.
[297:43.45]Slime room Guts room It kind of is a Nickelodeon room, but that's alright It is a Nickelodeon room
[298:13.39]It's because of that chair.
[298:14.59]It's the yellow chair.
[298:16.54]Orange, whatever.
[298:17.16]You need a bucket of plaster.
[298:20.24]Oh, fuck off.
[298:21.96]Alright, let's get a bucket of plaster.
[298:25.48]Uh, I think that mirror house changed me forever.
[298:41.38]I'm like forever a different person.
[298:53.92]You okay?
[298:57.75]Same, to be honest.
[299:11.25]So is Desperados 3 actually a good game?
[299:14.36]I want to play it.
[299:15.36]But there was a promise I had to keep.
[299:21.28]I believe it is.
[299:26.61]Music being off makes this really strange.
[299:32.23]Yeah, it kind of does.
[299:33.77]How about...
[299:39.45]Sounds like another... It's a generic shooter.
[299:45.93]No, no more scary shit.
[299:48.03]Pac-Man World 2.
[299:54.47]Silent Hill is scary shit.
[300:00.99]Pac-Man World OST.
[300:02.39]Full soundtrack.
[300:03.35]Alright, nice.
[300:04.95]I'm looking forward to this.
[300:07.93]I love this guy.
[300:12.91]Alright, let's do it.
[300:15.55]That's enough of the green.
[300:16.27]I think it looks good.
[300:17.59]I don't want the wood though.
[300:18.45]Remember, I'm a carpet guy.
[300:19.97]I know, you know, punching, punch him, punch him, get him, kick his ass, right?
[300:25.69]I know.
[300:32.86]That wasn't meant to be a joke.
[300:33.96]I know, don't make the crickets thing.
[300:37.12]Okay, floor.
[300:38.86]Floor, panels, and covering.
[300:41.92]Here we go.
[300:43.29]Green carpet?
[300:44.15]No.
[300:44.51]I like a gray.
[300:46.39]A gray or a little blue.
[300:47.99]Gray carpet.
[300:54.76]I think I'm into the... This one can blend in pretty well.
[301:03.13]How about I let the dog in?
[301:13.85]This is just like what the- this is what you hear if you're fucking Mike's neighbor.
[301:22.18]Hey, Jim!
[301:24.22]I'm just throwing my trash out the second story window trying to land it into the trash can!
[301:30.13]Have a good day!
[301:48.93]Why does he keep using Let's Plays for OST?
[301:53.37]This is Pac-Man World OST full soundtrack, high quality.
[301:57.10]Alright, that looks nice.
[302:03.94]The green doesn't work.
[302:04.74]It's not the right green.
[302:08.84]It has to change.
[302:09.88]It's not the right green.
[302:10.62]It just isn't.
[302:20.11]Wait, is it pistachio?
[302:21.16]Or is it ice blue?
[302:24.94]Is it pistachio?
[302:29.14]You know, don't do that.
[302:29.90]There's no mirrors to do that with.
[302:31.64]I like it.
[302:50.80]This is not a let's play.
[302:52.00]You're missing the plot.
[303:01.45]Shit.
[303:01.91]I'm missing the plot of Pac-Man World 2.
[303:06.91]There we are.
[303:08.99]That's nicer.
[303:15.04]We said this is a Miku room.
[303:21.50]Um.
[303:23.74]This is a blue room.
[303:28.05]This is like water.
[303:30.53]Robin's egg.
[303:31.31]This is Robin's egg blue.
[303:34.31]This is not Miku blue.
[303:37.91]That's not what it says on the can.
[303:43.77]What?
[303:43.93]This is a song.
[303:48.21]Miku blue.
[304:03.46]I like it.
[304:04.06]It's a great color.
[304:05.95]It's just like, it's teal.
[304:07.19]I'm not gonna replace the word teal with Miku blue.
[304:12.83]I'm sorry.
[304:13.51]I'm not participating.
[304:18.55]What else is even in this room?
[304:28.79]Christmas door?
[304:31.24]What's a Christmas door?
[304:36.08]Alright, internal door white.
[304:37.22]That works.
[304:37.66]What about the soundproofing?
[304:49.63]I'll do it.
[304:49.99]Okay, good.
[305:00.69]Wait, it's not good.
[305:01.93]It's not lined up right.
[305:04.49]Looks like shit is what it looks like.
[305:06.05]Why does it look so wrong?
[305:26.40]This looks like we leaned it in here and just didn't install it.
[305:32.20]Alright.
[305:32.74]Son, be very, very careful.
[305:34.40]Don't put too much weight on the door because it's not actually in there.
[305:39.72]It's just standing.
[305:40.59]There we go.
[305:53.89]That's a little odd.
[305:54.55]I'll fix it later.
[305:57.31]Jerm is still going strong.
[305:59.09]Yeah, I'll probably finish up here pretty soon.
[306:05.25]But I kind of want to do this tomorrow, and we'll play Despo- Okay, here, listen.
[306:08.59]I'm gonna promise you something.
[306:09.63]We're gonna play Desperados 3 tomorrow.
[306:12.09]But I'm gonna do this too.
[306:12.99]Okay?
[306:18.44]I have to make you guys my whole house.
[306:25.44]More House Flipper.
[306:27.20]Yeah, I'm gonna open with this.
[306:28.90]We'll play this for a little while.
[306:32.09]And then we'll move to Desperados 3 when I'm done with my new house.
[306:41.80]When am I going to end?
[306:42.46]I don't know.
[306:45.40]Probably soon though.
[306:47.10]We are encroaching on the 5 plus hour mark.
[306:50.23]And that's when I need to start to be cautious of how long I've been sitting down.
[306:56.83]But we're good.
[307:02.70]Esperados is going to get shafted.
[307:04.52]It's not.
[307:05.18]I promise.
[307:08.04]That's all I have in my room.
[307:09.12]Everyone thinks... Dude, I wonder what's in any interesting shit in a streamer's room.
[307:13.87]No.
[307:15.33]Wait.
[307:15.77]Hold on.
[307:17.23]Hold on a minute.
[307:19.45]Let me fix it. ...
[307:37.06]You wanna see what it looks like?
[307:37.98]What a streamer's room looks like?
[307:39.12]Is there any bags of trash?
[307:46.01]That are available?
[308:01.87]Give me one second.
[308:03.13]Give me one second.
[308:04.05]I need to turn the camera on just so you guys can fucking understand what I'm talking about here.
[308:09.30]One sec.
[309:10.17]Okay, so I didn't do anything.
[309:12.35]I had to just... It's out of the way.
[309:21.16]Just like clockwork, right, right, right.
[309:23.10]Okay, so... I'm gonna show you guys the ground in my room.
[309:28.78]I don't know why some of this stuff is even here.
[309:41.55]Yes, by the way.
[309:43.41]Those of you that are asking.
[309:45.62]I know I'm going to get a lot of questions about this, but there's a very specific reason why.
[309:48.58]No, there's not going to be shit on the ground.
[309:54.66]Hope not.
[310:06.26]This trash bag.
[310:07.48]This Elmo.
[310:11.39]And like a bunch of cords and shit.
[310:19.17]That's not a torture me Elmo.
[310:21.83]No.
[310:23.11]I don't know why that's in here.
[310:28.18]I really don't know.
[310:29.22]That's like- Kim got that for some reason.
[310:47.11]It's not a torture me Elmo This room is a fucking mess But I have to clean it I know but that's what I'm saying I was trying to go I wish I could go find the trash bags that I deleted
[311:15.20]You have your documents all over the floor.
[311:17.04]Yeah, I did that before.
[311:18.08]Oh, cool.
[311:21.15]That actually lights up perfectly.
[311:22.67]Okay.
[311:33.17]That looks good.
[311:36.75]There's not trash in there, by the way.
[311:38.85]It's storage.
[311:40.59]When you run out of places to put shit, it's like, okay, what am I gonna do with it?
[311:43.75]I gotta put this in a trash bag.
[311:44.76]That's all I have right now.
[311:48.24]That's storage right now.
[311:49.74]That's not trash.
[311:50.52]That's storage.
[311:53.04]Why a trash bag?
[311:53.76]Because it's a huge thing that, like, all the commercials, you can't rip through them.
[311:57.74]They're so hefty.
[311:58.44]They're so hard to break through.
[311:59.75]So why not use it for, like, a bunch of shit?
[312:01.11]Alright, I got that room.
[312:05.73]This is literally the cleanest my fake room has ever been.
[312:12.71]Is there food?
[312:13.19]Okay.
[312:21.33]I also need, like, laptop.
[312:26.69]What's going on?
[312:33.15]Socks?
[312:34.81]What is going on?
[312:42.73]It's Christmas time in the streamer room.
[312:46.12]The disc is skipping?
[312:52.46]No, get this out of here.
[312:58.40]No, I'm a clean guy.
[313:00.06]I need to do the... I'll show you.
[313:02.50]This is going to be fun.
[313:04.06]I just need... Just like foam.
[313:08.23]Walls.
[313:11.05]It might actually have to be...
[313:15.09]I don't know, like, what's just like a thing that's like a square that's black?
[313:21.39]Like a hang.
[313:26.34]Clean or not, you have to eat.
[313:27.34]Yeah, I know.
[313:28.56]A box?
[313:31.38]A mirror?
[313:32.38]No.
[313:33.94]Box.
[313:37.06]Gotta be able to sit on the wall.
[313:38.46]This guy has to be one of the lights.
[313:41.96]But I just never turn on.
[313:45.81]How am I supposed to make my streamer room if I don't have all my cool foam, dude?
[313:53.92]Damn it.
[313:59.22]Oh, never mind.
[313:59.82]Who cares?
[314:00.34]Use search foam.
[314:01.80]Why would foam be here?
[314:06.19]Maybe a painting?
[314:10.11]I'd have to upload a custom painting.
[314:11.31]Yeah, I'll use a picture of it.
[314:13.39]Yeah, I'll do that tomorrow.
[314:18.45]That!
[314:19.27]Whatever.
[314:22.17]I just saw it and I just... I cleaned it off.
[314:25.51]Okay.
[314:25.93]There it is.
[314:27.79]Here's the front door.
[314:28.63]I need... First of all, what do I want to have for my floor here?
[314:35.04]I think I'm... That looks kind of nice.
[314:37.82]Yeah, it does.
[314:42.46]I love it.
[314:42.78]I love the smokiness to it.
[314:57.19]Tile floor?
[314:57.99]Tile floor.
[315:00.00]Tile floor.
[315:00.62]Tile house.
[315:02.00]I'm not sure how many of you guys live in the southwestern United States.
[315:09.95]You gotta have some tile somewhere.
[315:16.64]Shit gets hot, hot, hot.
[315:24.40]Ooh, this is... I like this.
[315:26.78]I really like it.
[315:29.16]I really like this.
[315:31.24]This is sick.
[315:32.50]Okay, now we need a cool kitchen panels.
[315:38.70]How about... Hmm.
[315:39.60]Maybe, um... Maybe like a sand.
[315:47.13]Sand.
[315:47.91]I think I like a sand.
[315:56.50]At least you're having fun.
[315:57.34]Yeah, yeah.
[316:01.86]This music is a little kind of getting to me though.
[316:03.56]That's better.
[316:05.58]It's a little, it's too much.
[316:07.00]It's like playing in my brain.
[316:10.30]All panels.
[316:10.98]How about a cream?
[316:16.39]Cream works.
[316:26.51]Look at that.
[316:32.17]This is a house that looks so good you could just eat it.
[316:41.44]This is ResidentSleeper.
[316:53.52]Don't ResidentSleeper me.
[316:54.86]Don't do it.
[316:55.60]Don't you do it.
[316:57.84]You guys like keeping logs of me?
[316:59.41]Well, I got logs of all you ResidentSleepers.
[317:16.06]How does it look bad?
[317:18.24]Now we brighten this up a little bit.
[317:19.56]We get some color in here.

[318:06.88]Yes.
[318:09.92]Another two month break because of the mirrors.
[318:16.21]I remember, because this is my save file.
[318:20.63]Remember how long this takes when you don't have any of the upgrades?
[318:23.35]It's so horrible.
[318:27.45]What the fuck are they saying?
[318:31.07]Cigarette house.
[318:33.81]Something house.
[318:34.99]Something house.
[318:39.49]Cigarette house.
[318:42.96]Do not say that because I will make like a filter and then the actual cigarette and then the yellow.
[318:49.77]I'll make the cigarette house.
[318:51.37]I'm not doing Mirror 2.
[319:12.52]This is fucked up.
[319:22.99]Why's it not showing up?
[319:28.02]Where is it?
[319:31.20]There it is.
[319:41.95]This is not a... No, I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of me saying it.
[319:48.86]This is not that.
[319:49.82]This is not a cigarette house.
[319:51.78]This is smoky, white, and black, and cream with some accents.
[319:58.25]There's going to be some black furniture.
[320:00.03]There'll be maybe some oranges here.
[320:01.05]This is a good look.
[320:11.61]Okay, so.
[320:12.97]Not all the walls have to be like that.
[320:14.63]Just these ones here.
[320:15.37]Alright, let's go this way.
[320:29.57]This is the Mega Milk House.
[320:38.92]Oreo cookies and cream?
[320:45.00]That's a good look!
[320:46.22]It's not a cookie!
[320:50.37]Okay.
[320:51.09]Floor.
[320:52.33]I'm gonna put a wall here.
[320:55.15]God damn it.
[321:05.01]This is a school cafeteria.
[321:28.19]Why does it have to be perfect?
[321:30.69]You could have said anything else and it could have been kind of accurate, but it is so accurate that it's making me angry how accurate it is.
[321:39.33]So angry.
[321:40.01]I don't even... That's pretty good.
[321:55.14]That's gotta be best chat joke of the week, I think.
[322:00.29]It's up there for me, for sure.
[322:01.69]Okay.
[322:12.34]Oh, this room's ugly.
[322:17.79]Sorry, sorry.
[322:18.75]Okay.
[322:21.81]Okay.
[322:23.35]I need another... What the hell is this room?
[322:27.83]It's a 12-year-old room.
[322:37.10]I want to know the 12 year old that has a triple monitor gamer room set up.
[322:44.88]Hey, what do I always say?
[322:48.55]If that's the case?
[322:50.41]How many plants they got in there?
[322:51.83]How many plants they got in the corner of their houses?
[322:59.11]When I was a kid, I had this whole shitbox HB computer that the tint was wrong.
[323:09.09]And it got really hot.
[323:13.82]It was the shittiest computer ever and it got super hot and I was sweating my room all the time.
[323:20.78]I would play Diablo II on it.
[323:22.68]And Team Fortress Classic.
[323:29.21]Make the green room Meatwad's room?
[323:44.15]You guys, how are you guys this on point today?
[323:48.86]Holy shit!
[323:53.08]You guys are on fire today.
[323:57.60]This is the Aqua Teen house.
[323:59.82]Isn't this Frylock's room?
[324:01.18]Doesn't he have like a cool computer?
[324:02.56]This is Frylock's room, this is Meatwad's room, and then this is Shake's room.
[324:10.72]This is the TV's right here.
[324:14.16]No, no more cartoon houses!
[324:16.23]I don't want to make a Family Guy, I don't want to make The Simpsons, I don't want to make Aqua Teen.
[324:21.21]This, holy, this is the Aqua Teen house.
[324:22.68]That's the exact house.
[324:30.85]How did this happen?
[324:40.87]I don't understand why you're an idiot and I'm gonna throw this thing on the floor and it's gonna explode!
[324:49.40]Man, I don't know what you're talking about, man.
[324:52.34]I think you need to shut your mouth.
[324:54.44]The little guy has a mouth on him, I think!
[324:57.66]That's too bad!
[325:02.01]What's going on in here?
[325:02.77]I can't do Frylock.
[325:06.73]I'm leaving.
[325:07.23]I'm gone.
[325:07.69]I'm gone.
[325:08.09]I'm gone.
[325:08.31]I'm gone.
[325:08.59]I'm gone.
[325:08.87]I'm out.
[325:09.18]I'm out.
[325:09.54]I'm out.
[325:09.78]I'll see you tomorrow.
[325:12.16]I was so bad I have to fucking end the stream.
[325:13.66]I have to turn the stream off because that was so awful.
[325:29.36]Jeremiah's life is a cartoon.
[325:30.76]No, it just ends up that way for no reason.
[325:34.35]It just ends up like this.
[325:37.45]I have no control over this.
[325:38.81]Alright, I'm fixing this.
[325:48.72]End of stream Frylock.
[325:52.92]I'm so fucked up right now.
[325:54.34]Alright, I gotta get a front door.
[326:10.56]I can't.
[326:15.60]This guy is fucked up.
[326:16.98]I'm not fucked up.
[326:18.28]You're fucked up.
[326:19.08]Oh, it's not me.
[326:20.82]It's you.
[326:22.04]I didn't do anything.
[326:25.72]And by the way, Merry fucking Christmas.
[326:30.02]No, no, that's not how I'm going to end this.
[326:31.94]I'm not ending it that way.
[326:34.91]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[326:35.91]I'm not going to.
[326:36.43]Okay, calm down.
[326:39.40]everybody just relax okay I'm gonna I'm gonna do the bathroom whoa look at all this stuff is an ac unit an amountable ac unit
[327:04.34]A unit?
[327:05.92]Stop.
[327:06.60]Stop it.
[327:08.28]You guys are a bad influence.
[327:12.78]No, let's just... What about for walls in here?
[327:21.74]Uh, I'm thinking... Should I do a grandma house?
[327:26.89]Or Minecraft?
[327:29.73]Grandma house, or I've only played Minecraft for two hours, my whole house looks like this.
[327:40.87]Uh... 3D?
[327:43.93]These are 3D?
[328:06.89]Yeah, that's fucking ugly.
[328:11.17]Looks like instead of a beehive.
[328:15.97]Sell this shit, get this out of here.
[328:23.54]Here's the, okay.
[328:24.66]The problem that I have with decorating places is I, everything that is not just gray, white, or beige, just, it's just crazy, right?
[328:35.42]It just looks crazy.
[328:37.78]How do you design anything?
[328:38.74]I don't understand.
[328:39.70]How do people make anything look good?
[328:44.04]Like, this just looks crazed.
[329:08.85]This is pretty cool.
[329:12.69]This is what every single high-end hotel bathroom looks like.
[329:15.72]Put carpet in the bathroom now.
[329:29.61]No, I already did that before and I don't want to do that again.
[329:31.35]That sucks.
[329:35.85]Pretty cool.
[329:36.83]ResidentSleeper.
[329:43.36]Hey.
[329:44.76]Wake up.
[329:47.66]Oh, cool, I guess.
[329:49.07]Real cool, I guess.
[329:50.17]What happened?
[330:00.37]Windows in a bathroom.
[330:01.13]Yeah, I don't get that either.
[330:06.18]I don't know why there would ever be a window in a bathroom.
[330:09.79]Especially windows that are at somewhere around waist height.
[330:13.83]On a first floor, waist height.
[330:17.82]If those blinds are up, and I, okay, like, just think about that.
[330:23.62]I think we've had this exact conversation before, but there's a lot of potential new people here that I want to bring this up to.
[330:28.14]If you're peeing right here, and this window's right there, why would you ever want the opportunity for, like, the paper boy to just drive by and look over?
[330:41.40]Or anybody, literally, doesn't matter who.
[330:54.75]In fact, I'll go one step further.
[330:57.59]Every single blind in my entire place, doesn't matter where I am, is permanently closed.
[331:03.53]You guys like that too?
[331:08.98]They're never open.
[331:12.89]Because I know one day I'm going to like lock eyes with somebody outside of my window.
[331:17.17]There's going to be somebody like just out there.
[331:20.96]And we're going to lock fucking eyes.
[331:22.56]And it's going to be like, oh, shit.
[331:25.36]Okay.
[331:26.02]Then get away.
[331:26.66]No, all blinds closed.
[331:29.34]Everywhere.
[331:30.34]No windows.
[331:32.02]No open windows ever.
[331:32.72]I actually kind of like this.
[331:45.35]That doesn't seem very healthy.
[331:46.43]I mean, is it?
[331:48.77]Here, do another funny Aqua Teen impression.
[331:58.20]I'm like getting out of here very soon.
[332:02.63]Social interaction.
[332:04.96]I'm sorry, but walking eyes with a random person from your neighborhood?
[332:09.83]Or from like your... Outside of like your apartment complex?
[332:14.27]It's just odd.
[332:14.91]I don't want to do that.
[332:16.41]Who wants to do that?
[332:17.15]I don't want people to see me like... Plus, I'm naked all the time.
[332:23.96]Right?
[332:24.26]So, when am I... Why would I... What opportunity would I ever have to have any windows open?
[332:35.01]I'm constantly without a shirt, at least.
[332:37.92]So... What opportunity are the windows ever gonna be open?
[332:44.90]He's naked right now.
[332:46.72]I actually am not.
[332:47.90]I have clothes on today.
[332:53.20]This music's way too intense for what we're doing.
[332:57.38]Proven.
[333:00.08]I actually, you know what?
[333:01.24]I actually can prove it.
[333:03.86]I can prove it.
[333:08.60]No, I can't.
[333:09.30]The webcam is unplugged now.
[333:11.12]How?
[333:12.70]It doesn't make any sense.
[333:15.86]You saw me like four hours ago when I turned on the webcam.
[333:18.18]What are you talking about?
[333:18.82]Alright, installations.
[333:30.13]Toilet.
[333:35.97]No, this sink is... There we go.
[333:41.95]Okay, looks good.
[333:43.45]Toilet.
[333:43.83]I feel like I keep hearing this music in every Spider-Man movie.
[333:51.77]Okay, how about this one?
[333:57.14]Toilet standard.
[334:08.41]Alright, stick it on.
[334:09.05]Done.
[334:10.37]Done.
[334:22.08]I have to go.
[334:22.64]I have to go.
[334:23.90]I gotta go.
[334:24.42]I'll pick up tomorrow.
[334:25.88]Don't worry.
[334:26.34]We'll pick up tomorrow.
[334:27.10]I'm crossing that mark where I have to get up.
[334:31.72]I gotta go.
[334:33.38]I gotta go.
[334:39.93]I will pick this up exactly where we left it.
[334:42.49]And I'm gonna be... We're gonna make it happen.
[334:45.43]We're gonna do a whole mini golf course back here.
[334:49.54]And then I'm gonna pretend to you guys that I'm gonna play Desperados 3 tomorrow.
[334:53.30]But 4, 5, 6 hours is gonna go by tomorrow.
[334:57.48]And I'm gonna be like, oh shit, well we'll do that later.
[335:02.26]The plan is to do this and then play Desperados.
[335:05.10]And look, maybe we just play Desperados like a few days later, a couple days later, whatever.
[335:08.28]Hey James, thanks for the 10 subs.
[335:14.40]Thank you, James.
[335:16.67]A lot of people are here today.
[335:19.41]Hope you enjoyed the stream.
[335:20.24]Thanks for stepping by.
[335:21.00]We'll see you tomorrow.
[335:24.80]Thanks, guys.
[335:27.76]I missed massive bits?
[335:28.84]Holy shit, I did.
[335:29.88]This is a hundred bucks.
[335:34.22]10,000 bits from Stormy Choo.
[335:35.44]Thank you for the hundred dollars.
[335:36.41]Is Pac-Man totally tubular or Radical Man totally tubular?
[335:39.57]That's a very, very simple question for me to answer.
[335:50.22]But thank you.
[335:52.08]That's a ton of money.
[335:53.10]And I know, like I said, I don't read bits anymore.
[335:57.40]But people still decide it's a good idea to give me fucking hundreds of dollars.
[336:03.02]And I just hope you think it's worth it.
[336:07.27]Thank you.
[336:09.11]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[336:11.45]Good night.
[336:12.63]Goodbye.
[336:13.07]Have a wonderful rest of your day.
[336:18.43]Let's do the credits.
[336:21.59]Oh, that's Elmo.
[336:23.97]That's a picture of... Why is that... See?
[336:36.86]Dead.
[336:37.68]He's not dead.
[336:38.44]He's just sleeping.
[336:39.36]He sleeps on his stomach.
[336:44.15]This saves the game automatically.
[336:45.41]Yeah, it does.
[336:51.06]What music is playing?
[336:52.02]Oh right, Pac-Man.
[336:52.78]I forgot.
[336:53.06]Why did I think that was in House Flipper?
[336:54.72]Alright.
[336:58.84]Thanks everybody for subbing.
[336:59.70]Here they come.
[337:01.45]Just a moment.
[337:07.47]Yeah, there's a bunch of other stuff that I have too.
[337:09.01]I want to do custom Robo.
[337:12.60]I want to play Ghost of Tsushima too, but I don't even know if I'm going to stream that.
[337:16.14]I have no idea.
[337:19.53]When I took off that couple of months, I created a gigantic backlog of tons of things that I now need to figure out when they're going to happen.
[337:35.22]But thanks a lot.
[337:38.58]It's broken again.
[337:40.00]And I even, I had it.
[337:48.21]Why is this doing this again?
[337:49.41]I had it open.
[337:52.81]Did I?
[337:53.25]I did.
[337:53.57]I had... Am I gonna play Paper Mario?
[338:04.82]Yes.
[338:05.50]I will play.
[338:05.98]I promise I'll play Paper Mario.
[338:09.70]Thanks, big buddy.
[338:11.55]The only guy again.
[338:12.99]Two subs in two streams.
[338:16.39]We're on a roll.
[338:20.50]God damn it.
[338:21.14]Alright.
[338:21.64]Well, I don't know why this is happening again.
[338:24.72]Wasn't it open?
[338:30.14]By tomorrow, this is going to be fixed.
[338:34.22]If it ain't, then... Okay, if this is not fixed tomorrow, if this doesn't work tomorrow, I want the stream after that to only be germapunching emotes until I have to stop the stream.
[338:55.89]Bring the Winx back.
[338:56.89]No, the Winx.
[338:57.75]I can't do the Winx anymore.
[339:01.97]But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[339:02.93]We'll pick up right where we left off.
[339:05.35]Good night.
[339:06.50]Goodbye.
[339:06.92]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[339:09.46]See you tomorrow.
[339:11.18]Had a great time.
[339:11.82]I had a great time.

[342:24.19]Alright, we'll do that, and then I'm gonna raid GDQ, and then I'm gonna, can I even do that?
[342:41.40]Can we bounce around?
[342:42.10]I don't think you can even do that.
[342:51.68]Let me see if I can do like a raid bounce.
[342:53.54]Alright, here we go.
[342:58.36]Be nice.
[343:00.18]Be nice.
