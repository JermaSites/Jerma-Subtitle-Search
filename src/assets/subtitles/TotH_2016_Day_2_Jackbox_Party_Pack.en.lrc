[ve:61.1.100]

[00:07.22]Okay.
[00:09.38]What?
[00:10.12]You suck.
[00:11.73]No, you.
[00:12.71]What's the matter, you freaking stupid?
[00:13.87]I am going to strangle you.
[00:15.01]Yeah, come get some, you freaking wuss.
[00:22.68]Hey, guys and girls.
[00:24.08]Welcome back to the stream.
[00:25.16]Tip of the hat, it's 2016.
[00:26.82]You saw it yourself.
[00:27.84]It's the Jackbox Party Pack that we're getting ready to play here.
[00:31.47]We have a couch full of gamers looking to do their worst.
[00:35.31]We also have a...
[00:37.66]Balloonicorn to box.
[00:39.67]Standard.
[00:40.53]Yep.
[00:40.87]Standard issue on everything.
[00:41.59]We got Admirable.
[00:42.29]We got Slin.
[00:42.93]We got Jerma.
[00:44.55]Boys, some of us know this game, but for those that don't, and we've got gamers over here as well in the dungeon.
[00:50.08]Josh, Sideshow, Crocodile, Razefire, Mala.
[00:54.59]Okay, so what is this that we're playing?
[00:56.53]We're going to be playing a game called Quiplash first.
[00:58.86]Now, it's actually funny because a lot of us play this on our Twitch streams and get people online involved, and we don't always play it with eight people in the same place.
[01:08.28]Believe it or not, we don't all live in the same city.
[01:10.81]So we're trying our best, and we're pretty confident it'll be fine.
[01:14.95]But what is this game?
[01:16.26]It's similar to games such as Apples to Apples, Cards Against Humanity.
[01:22.99]We're trying to think of funny stuff.
[01:24.55]You'll get the hang of it.
[01:25.41]There's an in-game host who's lovely.
[01:28.04]His name is Schmitty.
[01:29.72]And he'll explain stuff, but you guys will get the hang of it.
[01:33.19]Now, we're all in the lobby, and we don't want to waste a lot of time.
[01:36.39]A good time to remind you guys, though, keep the donations coming in.
[01:39.37]You know, time doesn't stop while we're playing these games.
[01:42.01]It's entertaining, but let's keep it going.
[01:45.12]Keep it up for the kids.
[01:47.36]So we are in the lobby right now, all of us here, all the gamers.
[01:51.36]So tell you what, why don't we fire it up and go?
[01:55.85]Let's try this.
[01:57.47]It's exciting.
[01:59.71]We're going to hit everybody's in.
[02:01.21]And before you know it.
[02:03.29]Everybody's in.
[02:04.11]Yeah.
[02:04.74]Hopefully everybody's in.
[02:05.76]We're in.
[02:07.16]I've actually never played this before.
[02:08.10]We'll have the explanation right here.
[02:09.42]People who don't know what's up.
[02:12.33]And am I right in thinking that the audience can join in as well?
[02:17.43]I don't know.
[02:25.33]Schmitty, come on.
[02:27.94]Schmitty.
[02:28.64]Any point during the game.
[02:30.41]Wish this guy would just shut up.
[02:32.45]This is round one.
[02:34.21]You'll see two prompts on your device.
[02:36.21]Answer them any way you want.
[02:37.73]Each answer will go up against someone else's answer, and everyone will vote on which they like most.
[02:42.60]It's simple.
[02:43.30]You get points based on the percentage of people who like your answer, and a bonus if you get more votes than your opponent.
[02:48.83]Go!
[02:49.35]Go!
[02:50.61]So guys, so while we're all keying and entering in our prompts, there's just kind of a bit of silence here while we think of a funny answer.
[02:57.67]and basically we'll be putting the answers then head-to-head, and we'll all be voting.
[03:02.14]Now, a lot of people might know you guys can join as part of the audience, and your votes count the same as well.
[03:08.61]All you gotta do is go to jackbox.TV, you put in that room code, and you'll be voting in no time.
[03:16.50]Wait, wait, you're gonna get more than one answer?
[03:18.20]I thought we were just doing one.
[03:19.26]No, two each, man.
[03:26.48]Wow, these guys are quick.
[03:28.02]Holy cow.
[03:28.58]I'm done.
[03:29.26]Jeez.
[03:30.25]Jerma just put a dirty word for both.
[03:32.23]I just hit a swim.
[03:33.21]You can't just put poop for both of them.
[03:35.85]That's against the rules.
[03:36.95]I didn't do that.
[03:37.45]We're trying to keep it fairly family friendly.
[03:41.40]Well, not really family friendly.
[03:43.08]Maybe, you know, 17 plus.
[03:46.06]Who are those two characters down there?
[03:48.51]I feel a little lonely over here.
[03:50.41]Why is my guy so sad?
[03:51.97]I'm thinking.
[03:53.73]Yeah, he is a little sad, huh?
[03:56.08]I'm not that sad right now.
[03:58.27]Oh, you're smiling now.
[03:59.82]Alright, G-Well's in.
[04:01.08]Who's last?
[04:03.22]Win for the green man.
[04:05.60]So these answers are going to come up then, now one by one, and I'll read them out for added comedic effect.
[04:15.25]I'm already laughing.
[04:17.03]Good job.
[04:19.06]Juicy Jim.
[04:19.36]Let's start this show.
[04:21.22]First one.
[04:22.80]You know you're comfortable in a relationship when you ask your significant other what you like.
[04:28.26]Scratch your back good, or donate older money to Toth.
[04:31.94]We're starting out very family-friendly here.
[04:34.47]Very family-friendly.
[04:36.71]Normally, sometimes you're pandering.
[04:39.13]This is cheating.
[04:41.47]Pandering isn't cheating, my man.
[04:43.15]It's not pandering if it's right.
[04:45.14]Right.
[04:46.68]Absolutely.
[04:48.10]Now, Toth is tip of the hats for anyone who's not familiar with that acronym.
[04:53.30]If you're not, maybe you're not.
[04:55.33]I mean, everyone's different.
[05:01.28]Oh, wow.
[05:02.15]Spread your back good.
[05:04.85]You know that's what you got to do.
[05:06.81]Jerma playing the safe game.
[05:08.60]Playing a little safe.
[05:11.78]A little close to the vest on that.
[05:15.97]This is PG.
[05:16.63]PG-13.
[05:20.23]the issue here is that like lathering Jerma is both the worst and the best potato man
[05:37.51]Lather up the potato, man.
[05:40.76]It's actually pretty bad.
[05:41.96]I think this is going to be a landslide defeat.
[05:45.56]That's so good.
[05:46.75]Apparently a theme of the day.
[05:48.55]Potato by a landslide man.
[05:50.43]Oh, you put potato for yourself.
[05:52.65]I thought it was... Pandering.
[05:56.60]You rascal.
[05:59.08]Don't pander.
[06:00.14]juicy juicy Jones and next how embarrassing for you you just blank sent in by Ron Patrick possibly from somewhere in Delaware possibly is that real got beaten by tank or you just started what the heck I was talking about scratching somebody's back you guys you guys are going all off the rails
[06:25.88]Who writes these answers?
[06:27.70]Us.
[06:28.44]We have to go with that one.
[06:33.31]I still think it's embarrassing to get beaten by a tag after that.
[06:38.00]All I want to say is I've got a killer instinct.
[06:39.99]I'll do whatever I need to do to win.
[06:42.97]Oh, jeez.
[06:44.70]Uh-oh.
[06:46.03]Oh, the audience went the other way.
[06:47.91]I got the audience vote.
[06:48.51]The audience went the other way.
[06:49.65]That's how important the audience vote is.
[06:51.14]They're not going for the potty humor, evidently.
[06:53.56]Oh, I see.
[06:53.98]So I get more points for getting the audience vote, even though I lost.
[06:58.01]Yes.
[06:58.73]With us.
[06:59.47]Alright.
[07:00.15]So I just need to go with Twitch chat.
[07:02.53]End foopas now or end pants now?
[07:05.24]Similar.
[07:06.14]Similar answer.
[07:07.92]What is a foopa?
[07:10.11]We can't say.
[07:11.29]I'm glad you asked.
[07:13.59]I'm going to pretend like I don't know.
[07:16.08]Friendly, unfriendly.
[07:19.08]Pants.
[07:21.28]Apple.
[07:23.77]Hat's coming off for that one.
[07:26.33]Please.
[07:26.75]Whoa.
[07:27.61]Tough crowd.
[07:29.60]Sweating.
[07:32.70]Fupas was crocodile.
[07:35.21]We're very quickly learning.
[07:37.90]the audience tough to win over gotta be clever with that audience pants who pass maybe it's a different language the worst thing you could stick
[07:54.96]Wow.
[07:55.82]Oh, these options.
[07:56.83]You'll hit in two different directions with that.
[08:00.01]Why is Toaster in a toaster?
[08:02.48]You put Toaster into the toaster.
[08:04.94]Kicking the door down on the meta humor.
[08:06.68]You don't put your arm in a toaster.
[08:08.31]You put bread in a toaster.
[08:10.37]Why would you put toast in it?
[08:11.79]It's already done.
[08:12.63]Extra crispy.
[08:15.28]Why would you already do it?
[08:16.22]Excuse me, how many times do you put toast in the toaster and then it comes out and you're like, oh, that's not even close to being done enough.
[08:21.14]True.
[08:21.87]That's a very good point.
[08:22.79]That's a sideshow joke right there.
[08:24.59]Sideshow.
[08:26.49]Don't mind if I do.
[08:27.59]Mopping the floor.
[08:28.42]Stick my arm in a toaster.
[08:32.68]You shouldn't really use the results of that as advice.
[08:36.23]Next in line, a crazy thing to find during a colonoscopy.
[08:40.42]Balloonicorn in a box or ice cream sideshow?
[08:43.85]Oh man, this is so wacky.
[08:45.63]Ice cream sideshow.
[08:47.53]I guess that's an ice cream version.
[08:49.29]What is ice cream sideshow?
[08:51.01]An ice cream version of you?
[08:52.71]Or it could be a sideshow, you know, like a circus thing, I guess.
[08:56.72]Are these things that people have eaten then and have passed down to the colon?
[08:59.70]Because that changes things.
[09:01.62]It doesn't have to come into the mouth.
[09:02.82]You tell me.
[09:03.62]It'd be a lot more surprising for someone to eat a balloonicorn in a box than an ice cream, you know?
[09:08.11]Impressive almost.
[09:09.33]You know, I actually kind of thought that was you.
[09:12.20]I thought he was in there still.
[09:13.93]For some reason, I looked over, I was like, yeah!
[09:15.92]Oh, that's not him.
[09:18.31]Balloonicorn takes that one.
[09:19.57]So this is the first round.
[09:21.45]The game is three rounds.
[09:24.43]And next is... The last round is crazy.
[09:26.44]...a bad name for a brand of bottled water.
[09:28.44]Nice.
[09:36.63]Booty sweat.
[09:37.99]We're getting real wacky here.
[09:40.69]Everybody has some wacky... Look out for these guys.
[09:42.87]Nut.
[09:44.59]Nut water.
[09:47.16]It's so wacky.
[09:47.97]It doesn't even sound good.
[09:50.87]Why'd you buy that, is what I would say.
[09:53.44]You were curious.
[09:54.44]Pass me a bottle of that nut.
[09:55.58]You saw it on the shelf and you were like, you know what?
[09:59.07]I kind of need to buy it.
[10:01.73]James.
[10:01.87]James, big time.
[10:03.09]Now, Lauren, you went with booty sweat there.
[10:05.00]Can you walk us through that one?
[10:08.14]It just sounded wacky.
[10:08.92]It won by seven votes.
[10:10.62]That was a wacky.
[10:12.87]I knew where the crowd came from.
[10:15.15]Most people think Julius Caesar said et tu, Brute, when he got stabbed.
[10:19.13]But what he really said was blank.
[10:22.33]I was expecting a TF2 line or something like that, a spy-related thing.
[10:38.11]I never really was on your side.
[10:39.75]Memes are spy-related.
[10:40.65]Yeah, I guess so.
[10:41.77]That's true.
[10:42.81]You know, memes are a pretty new idea.
[10:47.96]I think.
[10:49.46]The Romans definitely had memes.
[10:51.75]They might not have called them that.
[10:52.93]They might have just said jokes.
[10:55.97]They just called it memes.
[10:58.25]Slynn, grow up.
[11:00.16]Oh, my God.
[11:00.40]Oh, with the audience vote.
[11:01.76]The audience.
[11:02.12]You know, what are we going to do?
[11:02.98]He's playing to his crowd here.
[11:05.68]You got to learn to play the game, man.
[11:07.64]Round one is in the works.
[11:08.89]So we're realizing how important the audience vote is already.
[11:12.03]So if you're not in the audience already, guys, get on in here.
[11:14.65]Jackbox.TV.
[11:15.31]Who's in seventh place?
[11:16.88]Lauren.
[11:17.34]Lauren in eighth place.
[11:18.50]Lauren and Slim.
[11:20.00]Listen, Jeremy, I feel you, buddy.
[11:23.24]I can't reach that coffee because I will get pulled back.
[11:28.59]I'll get court-martialed.
[11:36.40]so we're entering our funny answers right now some people perhaps just writing nut oh boy I don't know what the heck oh geez are you looking at my answer no no no better not be
[12:01.17]Oh, boy.
[12:03.84]Oh, boy.
[12:04.02]Oh, boy.
[12:04.94]You must have the same question as me.
[12:06.48]I ain't doing good at this game.
[12:09.86]I'm not concerned with winning, let's just say.
[12:24.74]Oh, man.
[12:31.15]This round is going to be amazing.
[12:32.30]I can tell already.
[12:39.01]For a guy who's played this hundreds of times, I have zero ideas for anything at all.
[12:45.58]Sorry, subs.
[12:50.73]634 in the audience.
[12:52.59]That's a large chunk of the vote.
[12:54.29]That is a chunk.
[12:55.94]That is a chunk.
[12:58.70]Let's take a look.
[13:00.24]Let's take a look.
[13:02.32]The biggest complaint of people in hell.
[13:05.85]Short winters.
[13:07.17]Go ahead and vote on which one I think.
[13:14.32]Roasted.
[13:16.42]Get some Toth Roasted in the chat.
[13:20.31]Get a whale.
[13:20.89]What do you think about this answer here?
[13:22.98]Which one are you voting for?
[13:24.32]I'm on the Chamber of Commerce in hell, and it's a good, steady job.
[13:29.79]Good benefits.
[13:30.59]Eat my family fed.
[13:34.69]Alright, Slim.
[13:37.56]Slim, I'm here with get a whale.
[13:40.86]Jeremy, I voted for yours.
[13:43.15]I voted for yours.
[13:46.41]That was a real piece of comedy.
[13:48.83]Somebody wrote your name, so you win.
[13:52.03]The most presidential name you can think of.
[13:53.86]Come on.
[13:54.70]What is this?
[13:56.62]Trump or Sideshow McBalloonicorn?
[14:00.03]Okay.
[14:00.99]Two different sides of the spectrum here.
[14:03.43]Republican?
[14:04.11]Democrat?
[14:05.65]Are you assuming my political...
[14:10.92]Perhaps I should remove you from the two-party system of this United States of America.
[14:16.41]Yeah, I'm not sure I would have beaten Hillary Clinton in the Democratic race.
[14:19.78]In the foot race.
[14:21.03]I just think Sideshow Maple Unicorn is hard to pronounce.
[14:24.87]I'm pandering to the public here.
[14:29.12]You might have thought you were pandering to the public.
[14:32.73]I got your back, buddy.
[14:34.51]Hey, you wrote somebody's name.
[14:40.36]That was funny, James.
[14:42.16]Don't listen to that.
[14:44.46]Short winters.
[14:47.13]Wow.
[14:49.72]That one or his taste in memes.
[14:52.59]Two really killer winner answers here.
[14:56.43]Tyrone Wang, of course, one of the most well-known legendary soldiers.
[15:02.24]And, of course, he comes in small, floppy action figure, which is what King Kong is really self-conscious about.
[15:08.87]Speaking of which, thank you for iBUYPOWER for that sponsorship.
[15:12.22]Great time.
[15:13.76]Great time.
[15:15.02]Great time.
[15:15.76]I was torn between these two.
[15:19.65]I mean, once again, you name a name.
[15:23.31]You write your name, somebody's name, or you write meme.
[15:26.46]I'm just going to write getaway for every other one now.
[15:29.62]But my own name.
[15:30.74]You never have a blank when you need one.
[15:33.61]Battery.
[15:34.43]Kappa or rocket jumper.
[15:36.43]Battery.
[15:37.21]Battery.
[15:37.77]Battery would be a good answer.
[15:38.76]You never have a battery.
[15:40.16]Yeah.
[15:40.83]I was at the airport, and the guy going to security pulled out four D batteries out of his shirt pocket.
[15:46.08]He's got to be like 60 years old.
[15:47.34]I'm like, who the heck carries D batteries to an airplane?
[15:50.32]That guy always has a charged Game Gear.
[15:53.52]I had a Game Gear at home, my man.
[15:55.77]That Game Gear, you had a choice.
[15:57.13]You had batteries or a flaming AC adapter that would just light up into flames.
[16:02.49]Plug it into the wall.
[16:03.32]It was this big.
[16:04.58]Enormous.
[16:05.42]Guys, I blanked.
[16:06.18]I'll be honest with you.
[16:07.34]I truly blanked.
[16:08.62]But Kappa are people who love Twitch.
[16:11.61]Kappa.
[16:12.29]You're implying that Jerma and Mala don't love Twitch?
[16:15.71]No.
[16:16.03]Please, check your privilege.
[16:18.16]Okay, next one.
[16:19.78]The worst things to juggle.
[16:22.54]Trump.
[16:23.31]Chainsaws.
[16:24.17]Come on.
[16:29.38]I wonder who did that one.
[16:31.06]Or clowns.
[16:32.86]Come on.
[16:33.58]I feel like I know where the audience is.
[16:36.08]I feel like I know where the audience vote's going.
[16:37.88]Come on!
[16:41.12]Come on!
[16:41.30]Really, that you're going to make somebody answer?
[16:43.49]Come on!
[16:44.19]I got you, Chainsaws, right here.
[16:48.73]You'll get cut off!
[16:50.45]Come on!
[16:51.05]Wow.
[16:54.26]Slin's got my back.
[16:54.96]I will take those.
[16:55.80]I think it's hard to throw a clown.
[16:57.92]Now, Slin didn't vote for that one.
[17:00.10]Push chat.
[17:02.03]What the heck?
[17:04.04]Clowns?
[17:04.90]Really?
[17:05.36]You get your hands cut up.
[17:06.82]The audience is messing up.
[17:08.63]The most G-rated term for an election.
[17:10.09]Oh, here we go.
[17:11.65]Politicorn's horn or slim bee?
[17:17.10]That's a good one.
[17:18.70]I was wondering at first what in the hell I was looking at here.
[17:20.99]I just saw the top angle of it.
[17:23.75]Is that a slim bee?
[17:25.09]Happy to see me.
[17:26.89]Yeah, it works.
[17:31.74]Slim button.
[17:32.78]I'm sure that anyone who didn't know what a Slim B is, it's being used right now on the Twitch chat.
[17:38.06]As we speak.
[17:40.83]What can I say?
[17:41.57]You wrote that?
[17:44.71]Yeah.
[17:45.17]Love bananas.
[17:46.03]I didn't, the person who came to mind.
[17:48.26]He's got a panda, man.
[17:49.02]Absolutely shameless self-promotion.
[17:50.66]This guy is self-interested over here.
[17:52.44]It's not even an emote anymore.
[17:53.52]You're not an emote.
[17:56.91]And next is, name the eighth dwarf who got cut at the last minute.
[18:00.07]Potential here.
[18:01.07]Bloodsire.
[18:06.65]Woo!
[18:09.35]Or chunk.
[18:12.09]He's a very compact man.
[18:15.95]What's wrong with that?
[18:17.28]I'm into it.
[18:18.10]I'm into it.
[18:19.74]I don't want to influence the audience, but... Two toots.
[18:28.33]He needs to defend himself.
[18:29.91]He needs to defend himself.
[18:30.47]He's here right now.
[18:32.58]He's here right now.
[18:33.00]Justin just busted in through the doggy door.
[18:34.84]I didn't vote for that.
[18:35.48]That was slander.
[18:37.92]I didn't vote for it.
[18:40.10]That was great.
[18:41.80]I got to apologize to the blood side.
[18:44.45]I think you can apologize to me in the alleyway later on.
[18:47.39]The best thing to yell while going over Niagara Falls in a barrel.
[18:50.82]Geronimo.
[18:51.86]Will you marry me, Sean, or I'm your buddy?
[18:53.90]Fish.
[18:54.68]Fish.
[18:55.11]Fish.
[18:58.53]What are you doing?
[19:00.41]What?
[19:01.19]Sean!
[19:02.79]Sean!
[19:03.69]Yeah, Carol is going to be upset on that if that's our Sean.
[19:06.84]Maybe that's how it happened.
[19:07.96]Maybe that's how she proposed.
[19:10.04]Yeah, we'll have to check in about that later.
[19:11.76]Maybe she went over Niagara Falls.
[19:13.97]Seems reasonable.
[19:14.77]In a barrel.
[19:15.79]In a barrel.
[19:16.61]I got it.
[19:17.09]Of course.
[19:17.45]How else are you going to survive that rain?
[19:23.83]I don't know.
[19:24.53]I completely am blanking this game.
[19:26.68]Don't worry about me.
[19:29.53]I'll be fine.
[19:30.37]411.
[19:30.95]I like how they eat the points.
[19:32.81]What's up with that?
[19:34.24]They're hungry.
[19:36.00]Why do you eat, Slim?
[19:37.50]I love eating.
[19:38.85]I just don't like bananas.
[19:40.51]He just eats to make Twitch him eat.
[19:42.18]There's a banana on the table place again Lauren okay, Lauren slipping down to third I didn't write a person's name or a meme You're in the last place when capping his way into the lead are tripled there's just literally I've never played this game of answers have been like completely honest or a dad joke What?
[20:11.50]Dad jokes.
[20:12.57]Dad jokes.
[20:15.67]You have less time in this final round.
[20:18.92]I'm going.
[20:19.74]Alright, buddy.
[20:22.18]Only one?
[20:26.73]Yeah, so we all get the same prompt, and everyone's against one another.
[20:30.50]Points, as Schmitty, my good friend, said, are tripled.
[20:35.12]Schmitty.
[20:36.45]Joshua Schmitzenstein.
[20:39.38]And that's just what they use for his name in this.
[20:42.59]This music is making me start to freak out.
[20:46.07]It's like you're stuck in a terrible carnival.
[20:47.94]I feel like I should be in a clown costume.
[20:50.48]Gene Wilder driving me into a tunnel in a boat.
[20:55.17]Somebody didn't answer.
[20:56.79]Soak it in.
[20:58.09]I got bodied, man.
[20:59.21]So we got great study.
[21:01.70]Use tongue.
[21:02.22]Tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue.
[21:05.28]Clam up.
[21:06.86]Teeth.
[21:08.41]Fish.
[21:10.39]Or pocket the heaviest.
[21:13.30]I already voted immediately.
[21:22.64]Who didn't get time to put one in?
[21:24.90]That was me.
[21:27.40]No answer.
[21:29.05]You vote for three?
[21:30.33]Yeah, you have three votes to allocate.
[21:32.03]Now, if you're in the audience at home, you only get one.
[21:34.56]But maybe if it's an open event next year, you could be here.
[21:37.62]Probably not.
[21:40.60]No offense.
[21:42.25]We're good with who we got.
[21:43.38]We feel comfortable with our rate.
[21:51.07]Guys, who do you think?
[21:51.99]I mean, is it going to be, uh, Slynn?
[21:54.55]Slynn, I mean, there's no memes there, so it's hard to know which one you vote for.
[21:58.38]Right, right.
[21:58.68]Great study.
[21:58.98]It takes great study.
[21:59.76]I didn't understand that one either.
[22:01.10]It takes great conventional study.
[22:02.97]But I do vote to it.
[22:04.35]Great study.
[22:05.03]Three percent.
[22:06.55]Use tongue.
[22:07.55]Thanks, Slynn.
[22:07.95]Slynn going sexual.
[22:09.64]Now where's mine?
[22:11.06]I think I'm in dead last.
[22:14.78]Us old guys gotta stick together.
[22:17.93]Clamor.
[22:20.19]That was a good one.
[22:23.84]I gave you two on that.
[22:24.90]All of your answers are one word.
[22:26.58]I like it with teeth.
[22:29.15]This time try it with more teeth, my friend.
[22:33.57]So now it's down to fish and pocket the heavy.
[22:35.44]Is it really fish?
[22:37.18]We should have memed.
[22:38.48]Oh, man.
[22:41.17]We should have memed.
[22:42.25]Somebody memed.
[22:44.25]Please.
[22:45.41]Please, please, please.
[22:49.27]Yep.
[22:49.65]Wow.
[22:50.13]I know.
[22:50.45]Wow.
[22:51.47]I'm smart.
[22:53.61]Wow.
[22:54.46]Take my shirt off.
[22:55.86]Take my shirt off.
[22:58.34]Who won?
[22:58.68]That's it.
[22:58.90]I think it was still slim.
[23:00.02]I voted for that one because I didn't think anyone would vote for it.
[23:02.69]Yeah.
[23:03.73]Yeah, okay, buddy.
[23:04.59]Alright, bud.
[23:07.43]Science shows!
[23:09.80]Science is!
[23:11.20]Wow.
[23:12.08]Surprise.
[23:13.22]Let's go.
[23:15.83]So we're going to stay off of the game thing here while we all get into the next game.
[23:20.55]So whoever's in charge, yeah.
[23:22.60]So what you can do is click, yeah, you can do it that way.
[23:26.62]I'll do it this way.
[23:27.38]So we'll get production.
[23:28.42]Some of us can see it.
[23:29.77]I got disconnected.
[23:30.73]What are we doing, another lobby?
[23:31.91]Yeah, so give us a second to, yeah.
[23:36.19]We all good?
[23:36.55]Yes, yeah, we're going to do another game.
[23:38.83]Of course we are.
[23:39.71]We have it there.
[23:40.49]Nobody say it out loud, please.
[23:42.90]Wait, where is it?
[23:44.00]It's Q-R-W-3.
[23:47.38]Shut up, Sideshow.
[23:49.08]Nice troll.
[23:52.33]Dude, this guy's trying to troll.
[23:53.75]Can we call the police?
[23:54.97]Got it.
[23:59.02]Hello, I'm the police.
[24:00.16]Now, nobody get any wacky name ideas here.
[24:03.32]You guys put fart for a name.
[24:05.58]You're going to bed.
[24:07.36]That would be so wacky.
[24:09.01]You're going to bed.
[24:11.05]That's what I just said.
[24:11.87]Did I stutter?
[24:14.80]I'll put you to sleep.
[24:17.22]Everybody's in.
[24:18.24]Are we all in?
[24:20.28]No, we got two people still waiting.
[24:22.59]Can you not see it?
[24:24.83]Can you not hear production?
[24:26.45]We do not know.
[24:27.28]There you go.
[24:28.18]They can't hear production.
[24:29.14]It's this.
[24:29.70]Spin it around.
[24:32.51]Okay, thank you.
[24:34.03]Wow.
[24:34.41]Oops.
[24:34.97]Now I've lost control of my monitor.
[24:37.18]Guys, keep donations coming in.
[24:39.28]If we get enough, we're going to get Slinda to take his shirt off.
[24:43.75]I don't remember doing that one.
[24:44.69]I don't remember that one.
[24:45.67]We're in.
[24:45.91]We're in.
[24:46.11]Well, you shouldn't do drugs, Flynn.
[24:53.37]Why?
[24:55.25]It's true.
[24:55.79]Don't do them.
[24:56.87]Are we all in now?
[24:57.67]Yes.
[24:58.32]Alright.
[24:58.54]Let's fire it up.
[24:59.24]I just imagine it.
[25:00.54]I don't get to be the red guy anymore.
[25:03.50]I think Jerm is in charge.
[25:05.01]You're the first one in.
[25:07.43]Whoever goes in first has to hit.
[25:08.95]Everybody's in, I think, right?
[25:10.34]Are you all in?
[25:11.68]I am in.
[25:12.56]I think your answer is fun and funny.
[25:16.03]Guys, now let's do a funny one.
[25:17.79]Do a funny one.
[25:18.76]Should we put a blanket van on these?
[25:20.98]Yeah, right.
[25:21.98]Good luck enforcing that.
[25:23.12]Yeah, good luck with that one, man.
[25:24.06]Hey, here's Schmitty here.
[25:25.73]Those can't be real names.
[25:27.77]Get serious.
[25:28.31]We're trying to play a game here.
[25:29.65]Aw.
[25:32.06]Schmitty needs a swift punch.
[25:35.06]I hate Mondays.
[25:39.54]This is round one.
[25:41.36]You'll get two prompts on your device.
[25:43.06]Audience, we hope you're in on this one as well.
[25:45.54]The game code is there in the corner.
[25:47.63]It's up here.
[25:48.27]Everyone will vote on their favorite.
[25:49.95]You score based on the percentage of players who like your answer.
[25:53.13]Plus, there are winner's bonuses at stake.
[25:55.08]Classic visual gag.
[26:00.24]By the way, guys, the last giveaway of the day is live.
[26:04.11]It's free, so get your butts in there.
[26:06.03]Come on now.
[26:11.25]No, I don't know.
[26:12.05]This is tough.
[26:19.80]We're doing some wacky answers.
[26:23.70]That's so... I mean, I am anyways.
[26:25.08]I don't even know if I'm spelling this word right.
[26:27.85]How do you spell Frank or Z?
[26:32.85]Yeah.
[26:37.30]Hmm.
[26:45.81]So many options here.
[26:55.74]Giggling at myself.
[26:58.63]Jiggling at myself.
[27:00.35]Hmm?
[27:06.56]Well, I was fresh out of anything good there.
[27:09.65]Yeah, that was me first game.
[27:11.71]I feel you.
[27:13.34]Guys, we got three people.
[27:14.34]We got 15 seconds here, guys.
[27:15.80]Type something.
[27:16.90]Oh, God.
[27:17.90]13 seconds.
[27:19.35]Type something.
[27:21.39]Jim.
[27:22.36]Come on.
[27:23.36]Gemma.
[27:24.46]Jeremy.
[27:24.70]That's right.
[27:25.84]Poop.
[27:26.10]You got to go.
[27:29.23]P. I get it.
[27:30.29]P. Okay.
[27:30.75]Here we go.
[27:31.09]That was a clutch defuse there.
[27:32.39]Our first prompt is the least threatening name for a serial killer.
[27:36.86]The Boston Blank.
[27:38.00]Bloodsire.
[27:39.88]Clickbait article writer.
[27:41.86]Or the Boston Raised Mom.
[27:44.37]Get out of here.
[27:44.71]Get out of here.
[27:46.91]Uberchain, can we get Slynn out of here?
[27:49.95]No, we're good.
[27:51.10]We're okay.
[27:51.60]I thought of the least threatening name possible.
[27:55.18]And I immediately went to Ray's mom.
[27:58.22]Ray, how do you feel about that?
[27:59.97]I mean, he's right.
[28:01.97]My mom's not very threatening, so... I ain't disagreeing.
[28:05.77]Oh, it's to you.
[28:07.50]Why is that?
[28:10.35]And we knew it was slim, too.
[28:12.61]Come on.
[28:12.91]You could just, like, hear him giggling, man.
[28:14.84]Sorry, I just couldn't think of anything.
[28:17.68]I told you it was a rough round.
[28:19.42]I like to laugh.
[28:20.65]Just laughing at myself.
[28:23.59]Just thinking about a joke I heard.
[28:25.71]The worst Viking, Eric the Blank.
[28:29.33]Eric the HVAC installation guy.
[28:32.64]Or Eric the exhausted.
[28:34.16]Who's laughing?
[28:45.76]Who's doing the ridiculous wheeze?
[28:51.40]He's had to take his headset off.
[28:56.54]It's usually frowned upon to write, ha ha ha.
[29:01.06]Oh, I forgot to vote.
[29:02.62]Oh, crap.
[29:03.50]Come on.
[29:04.25]I was rushed.
[29:06.41]Finally got one.
[29:07.59]I had no time.
[29:09.05]Oh, that's Eric.
[29:09.77]I like how you annotate your own, like, I don't know why this is.
[29:14.14]Come on.
[29:14.56]This is so funny.
[29:15.76]Save money on grocery bills.
[29:18.86]Pocket the heavy.
[29:19.78]Wow, you can't reuse answers.
[29:21.77]Or starve.
[29:23.59]Come on, gang.
[29:25.88]Really just pandering.
[29:28.26]This is called Pander Box Party Pack.
[29:31.70]Sometimes you just gotta play for the win, man.
[29:33.45]Is starving that quick, though?
[29:34.59]Like, I feel like it would take a long time to start.
[29:37.39]Don't think about it.
[29:38.07]Just answer.
[29:38.79]The starving is not quick, but the money you save is instant.
[29:42.50]You don't have to go again.
[29:43.42]It's a long-term plan.
[29:44.84]Think of the money you'd save.
[29:46.21]That's true.
[29:47.99]Thinking.
[29:48.95]Alone.
[29:50.03]All of your answers are one word.
[29:53.62]I think I accidentally clicked.
[29:55.36]Would you rather they be words or emotes?
[30:00.56]Your ears aren't even words.
[30:02.14]You didn't put brackets.
[30:04.77]The worst part about being a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.
[30:09.35]Puberty.
[30:11.27]Swamp ass.
[30:15.28]Now what's that?
[30:17.02]What is that?
[30:18.50]It's like mud butt.
[30:22.75]I mean, they do use the word erection and stuff.
[30:24.71]There are sexual things in the game.
[30:26.85]If there are parents out there, I mean, you've already put your kids in the other room, so we're not worried.
[30:32.62]Swamp ass.
[30:35.17]That word again.
[30:36.01]Swamp ass.
[30:43.12]There it is.
[30:43.66]The audience.
[30:44.78]The audience showing their true colors.
[30:49.84]I like to think that they liked swamp bass more than they disliked puberty.
[30:53.74]Coming up next, something you should never use as a scarf.
[30:58.70]Neither of you get any points.
[31:02.75]Nobody gets any points.
[31:04.17]I refuse to vote.
[31:05.15]Unbelievable.
[31:06.25]Oh, you can't even?
[31:07.21]Yeah, if you both put the same thing, nobody wins.
[31:09.52]Victoria's Secret Catalog.
[31:11.10]Fish.
[31:12.18]Harambe.
[31:13.36]Or lace hazmat suit.
[31:15.28]See, the funny thing is too, I'm like sitting right next to her and she was like panicking and I just saw her type and I was like, oh my god, it's over.
[31:23.10]I can't compete with Harambe.
[31:24.46]VAC.
[31:25.49]Oh boy, remember when Harambe happened in May of this year?
[31:29.17]That was funny.
[31:31.06]I liked it.
[31:32.36]That was a really funny thing.
[31:35.01]to everybody.
[31:35.89]What do you think Twitch chat thinks, though?
[31:37.71]Three.
[31:38.52]I have no confidence in Twitch chat.
[31:40.82]There's probably a couple lols in there.
[31:42.64]Zero.
[31:43.34]Although I'm not surprised that it's you that wrote it.
[31:46.45]I ran out of ideas, like I said.
[31:49.23]Nice!
[31:49.45]You did it!
[31:51.08]You did it!
[31:51.88]You did the right thing.
[31:53.46]You did the right thing.
[31:54.88]It's a hazmat suit with some lace on it.
[31:56.19]Made out of lace.
[31:57.51]Slim, get dunked on.
[31:58.87]America's next top blank.
[32:01.01]Hat.
[32:04.18]Top of the hats.
[32:06.91]So we have top hat or top of the hats.
[32:11.18]Top of the hats.
[32:11.74]Now a top hat is a type of hat.
[32:15.19]This is kind of getting a little deep on me.
[32:17.87]I'm afraid I'm lost.
[32:20.12]I think the meta is overlapping itself.
[32:22.14]Of the hats is a meme.
[32:23.96]We have to go deeper.
[32:24.98]But if you look at just the bottom, it's just hat of the hats.
[32:30.31]Hat of the hats.
[32:31.11]Hat of the hats.
[32:33.48]Oh, boy.
[32:36.18]See you later.
[32:36.84]Who actually got dunked on this time?
[32:39.23]You got slammed.
[32:39.85]Listen, buddy, at least I've got dignity.
[32:43.22]At least I've got dignity.
[32:45.61]Harambe?
[32:46.41]Really?
[32:47.33]That's my next submission.

[33:39.58]Let's take a look at the scores.
[33:41.12]Let's take a look at the scores.

[33:58.57]I feel like we're just slowly going into the gutter.
[34:05.62]Yep.
[34:07.78]That's true.
[34:08.51]Let's be funny, guys.
[34:09.59]But let's be fun.
[34:10.61]Oh, boy.
[34:18.82]Okay, I got one.
[34:21.14]Now, Twitch chat, of course, you can get in on this as part of the audience.
[34:24.94]Keep donating as well.
[34:25.98]If I see that total donations stagnating, boy, you're going to your room.
[34:33.73]You guys are all going to your room.
[34:35.27]Three of you guys on the couch.
[34:37.72]Going to your room.
[34:39.78]You're going to bed.
[34:50.05]Let's see.
[34:55.86]Man, I just wrote Harambe twice, guys.
[34:57.70]I'm sorry.
[34:58.37]Aw, jeez.
[34:59.73]Just, you know, uh... I can't even... You having troubles over there?
[35:05.48]I can't... It's too long!
[35:10.54]Alright, people understand.
[35:12.16]Right?
[35:12.62]Is that how you do it?
[35:15.21]I think that's it.
[35:16.23]You could just write, like, flip over.
[35:18.68]It's on the other side of the page.
[35:20.44]Continue.
[35:23.17]We got less than 10 seconds.
[35:24.51]Come on, gang.
[35:25.29]Jeremy.
[35:25.99]Jeremy.
[35:28.75]Okay, it's time for some quiplashing.
[35:31.87]First one, a horrible pickup line.
[35:34.90]Oh boy, I bet it's this one.
[35:36.58]Hello, I like memes.
[35:37.86]Or let's rearrange the alphabet.
[35:41.87]I want to put IBC.
[35:45.15]That's... That is not... You and I.
[35:50.28]What the hell does that mean?
[35:51.52]I want to put, like, I before C. I screwed up.
[35:56.00]I before C. I got it wrong.
[35:57.26]I want to put I before E except after C. Exactly, exactly.
[36:00.61]That would have been funny.
[36:01.47]That's right.
[36:02.01]I got it wrong.
[36:03.05]There's no time for the audience to hear what your intention was, unfortunately.
[36:06.69]Oh, I literally just forgot to vote.
[36:09.40]Wow.
[36:09.66]That would have been hilarious.
[36:11.04]I cannot admit.
[36:13.74]I want to put I before E except after C.
[36:17.85]I was going to write, no, I would have put like rear edge, you before me and IMC, whatever it was.
[36:21.72]A great new invention that starts with automatic.
[36:24.09]We're past that.
[36:25.78]Automatic toilet paper or automatic face stabber.
[36:31.15]Automatic toilet paper?
[36:33.17]That sounds actually great.
[36:34.99]But what does that mean?
[36:36.01]Does it just like appear?
[36:36.87]I guess it wipes it for you.
[36:39.20]A sander belt or something?
[36:41.14]Like a sander belt, yeah.
[36:42.58]They have it already.
[36:43.20]They're called belt sanders.
[36:45.76]Look that up.
[36:46.04]Put that in your toilet.
[36:47.71]Belt sander.
[36:53.21]I'll never get a swamp pass again.
[36:57.57]Swamp pass, yeah.
[36:57.94]Yes.
[36:58.20]Now audience.
[36:59.64]Audience, please.
[37:01.84]What?
[37:04.93]Oh, wow.
[37:05.43]I didn't even say anything that round.
[37:06.61]I just let it go, and you were like, oh, yeah, toilet paper.
[37:08.97]That's so cool.
[37:09.88]Coming up next, a nugget nobody would want, the Blank of the Month Club.
[37:14.12]Slim, do you want to fight?
[37:16.00]Swap ass of the month.
[37:17.01]Vote on your devices.
[37:17.73]Or stank of the month club.
[37:18.95]Come on, guys.
[37:19.51]Use your brains.
[37:20.41]Use your heads here.
[37:21.47]We don't have to reuse answers.
[37:23.29]This is only the second game.
[37:25.00]Why did nobody put time?
[37:28.70]The time of the month.
[37:30.77]Time of the month.
[37:33.65]This month's time is 3.46.
[37:39.70]The time of the month.
[37:43.62]I don't get it.
[37:48.03]How come no one put time?
[37:51.35]Stank, of course.
[37:53.56]Crunk it down's got a real way with the audience.
[37:57.14]You're doing it, Ryan.
[37:58.08]You're really doing it.
[38:00.00]Next up, a Girl Scouts cookie name that got rejected because it was just too ridiculous sounding.
[38:06.15]I was going to say small bass or fish.
[38:07.75]Cookie Jake in Invite.
[38:10.57]A very niche answer there for the competitive community.
[38:15.38]Or Fiddler's Fingers.
[38:17.34]Fiddler's Fingers.
[38:19.13]That's a good one.
[38:22.05]Do you think is I can't even vote for the left one cuz I can't vote why this right thing froze Fiddler's fingers Appeal into Twitch chat
[38:40.26]Fiddler's green.
[38:41.68]Oh, I didn't even get the Twitch job vote.
[38:45.63]Tune in.
[38:46.51]Tune in.
[38:47.43]Fiddler's fingers.
[38:51.26]I'm into that.
[38:51.82]I'm into it.
[38:52.30]And next, a great way to cure the hiccups.
[38:55.75]Hiccups.
[38:56.49]Hitting the dad.
[38:58.40]Or drop Uber backwards.
[39:00.56]What does that mean?
[39:02.48]That one's for me.
[39:04.01]Yeah, Slynn is... What about for me?
[39:05.39]Slynn will tell us how to do that later on.
[39:07.11]We'll be dropping over with Slynn.
[39:09.39]I don't know which one the audience are going to go for.
[39:11.74]That's definitely going for hit the dab.
[39:13.16]Do you really have to wonder?
[39:13.82]They're going to hit the dab every time.
[39:15.52]You ever been on Twitch?
[39:17.85]They're going to hit the dab.
[39:19.99]Dab-erino.
[39:21.07]Bambino.
[39:22.44]Wins every time.
[39:26.21]Works every time.
[39:27.04]Oh, this is... Oh!
[39:33.38]Probably wouldn't be as popular with children if he were Bob the blank It's in the Bible it's okay for kids
[40:00.15]Bob the Explorer is in the Bible.
[40:01.91]Jeremy, you made a peculiar face when these ones popped up.
[40:04.49]Is that, should I read anything into that?
[40:06.48]Nah.
[40:06.94]No, I don't think so.
[40:08.60]Are they going for like Dora the Explorer, but like with Bob?
[40:11.07]Yes.
[40:11.53]I guess so.
[40:12.91]I was thinking Bob the HVAC guy.
[40:14.99]Exactly.
[40:15.96]That's exactly what I was going for.
[40:18.84]I knew it.
[40:21.41]Oh, boom.
[40:22.89]Whoa.
[40:25.02]Headshot.
[40:25.88]That's a headshot.
[40:27.32]That's a headshot.
[40:28.98]That's me dropping Uber backwards right there.
[40:30.70]Yeah, you dropped Uber backwards.
[40:32.34]Come up with a catchier, more marketable name for the Bible.
[40:35.43]Oh, boy.
[40:36.69]Jerma's word.
[40:38.13]Christ on a bike, motoring through Israel.
[40:47.14]We get the player cam over there.
[40:52.71]The one on the left better not win
[41:12.46]There we go.
[41:14.26]That was remarkably close, though.
[41:16.19]Crunk, are you okay over there?
[41:20.74]Crunk, it's okay.
[41:22.36]Okay, next one.
[41:23.38]I'm telling you, that would sell.
[41:24.43]You shouldn't get a massage at a place called blank.
[41:28.44]Unhappy endings.
[41:29.76]Time to vote.
[41:30.18]Or, I will end you, maggot!
[41:35.94]I don't know.
[41:37.93]I feel like I'd be at least curious to go to the second one.
[41:41.63]Not the first one?
[41:42.33]See how it goes.
[41:45.56]Unhappy endings.
[41:46.40]Everyone cries at the end.
[41:48.40]They have a crying room.
[41:51.86]There's something... There's a charm to both of these.
[42:00.06]So heading into the third round here, the final round, what are we looking at?
[42:21.61]Oh, wow.
[42:22.37]Broke still.
[42:23.51]But Sancho's sneaking up there in behind.
[42:25.75]Sneaking up.
[42:26.31]This is what I did last time.
[42:27.58]Start in third, move to second.
[42:29.08]This is round three.
[42:30.06]Steal it all at the end, right?
[42:30.90]You gotta go fast.
[42:31.52]Points are tripled, and everyone gets the same one single prompt this time.
[42:35.94]It's gonna be real funny.
[42:38.57]Fish.
[42:38.75]Fish.
[42:38.91]The prompt is... The worst family secret that could come out over Thanksgiving dinner.
[42:44.87]I don't know.
[42:49.74]Oh, boy.
[43:07.78]playing it risky there's a lot there's a lot of rest here hey guys we got 15 seconds so try to do something real quick it's quicker it's fast rocket so fast
[43:24.64]So fast.
[43:25.42]Come on, little carrot man.
[43:27.26]Come on, little carrot man.
[43:28.22]There he goes.
[43:29.06]It was Lauren.
[43:29.97]Everybody's in.
[43:30.93]Carrot man.
[43:32.19]I'm secretly a banny sub.
[43:34.51]I just saved 15% on my car insurance.
[43:37.16]Mom likes to dab.
[43:39.04]I didn't donate to Toth.
[43:40.24]America was stolen from the natives.
[43:42.08]Oh, boy.
[43:43.61]Not a secret.
[43:44.27]Poop.
[43:46.05]Or I put bees in that.
[43:47.47]Or I hated this dinner.
[43:49.26]There's a certain charm to poop, but is that really a secret?
[43:53.35]Poop.
[43:55.37]I was going to say something else, but I didn't have it.
[43:57.26]It's hard not to vote for poop, isn't it?
[43:59.58]Mom likes to dab.
[44:02.22]I like a lot of these, actually.
[44:10.33]Mom likes to dab.
[44:11.39]See, the thing is, I'm just imagining my mom.
[44:13.61]I'm sure everyone else is doing the same thing, trying to dab.
[44:16.56]I like the family that the worst secret that you have is, I hated this dinner.
[44:22.11]Everything else is perfect.
[44:23.59]What a terrible secret.
[44:24.49]But the potatoes were awful.
[44:25.71]I'm trying to think of the context of, I put bees in that one.
[44:28.69]What are we talking about here?
[44:30.34]The turkey, I guess?
[44:32.88]I gave you two.
[44:33.74]I like that one.
[44:35.94]I hated this dinner.
[44:37.38]I was going to say your food's gross.
[44:40.87]Mom likes the dad.
[44:42.41]Okay.
[44:42.95]What?
[44:43.45]Not a fan favorite.
[44:44.47]It's the best.
[44:45.27]Mama loves mumbo.
[44:48.10]Oh, boy.
[44:48.64]No Geico fans.
[44:52.88]Shoutouts to Geico, our sponsor.
[44:56.78]Poop.
[44:56.90]Poop.
[44:57.39]I voted for it.
[44:59.39]90% of people thought poop was the worst family secret.
[45:03.30]The natives one is, well, we can talk about that later on.
[45:11.18]We'll be touching on the natives part later.
[45:14.19]I put bees in that.
[45:15.01]Now, where do the bees go, Crunk?
[45:17.05]In the turkey?
[45:18.47]I mean, that's the secret.
[45:19.88]Yeah.
[45:22.18]Didn't donate to Toph.
[45:23.68]And secretly a banny stop.
[45:25.68]Shoutouts to Grant.
[45:27.32]Getting his comeuppance right here on the set.
[45:32.38]Our boy.
[45:34.02]There you go.
[45:36.73]48%.
[45:37.49]Sideshow maybe making a run.
[45:39.95]Let's go.
[45:40.37]Come on.
[45:41.91]Surely overtaking him here.
[45:43.99]Let's go.
[45:44.35]Lats.
[45:44.57]Wow.
[45:45.09]Lats.
[45:48.58]Lats.
[45:55.82]Well, Sideshow, you won both games.
[45:57.46]What the hell?
[45:57.88]I did.
[45:58.34]I'm just a witty genius.
[46:00.65]Can we turn the game sound down a little bit so we can chat?
[46:02.81]It's very loud.
[46:04.27]Well, because that's it.
[46:05.43]That's all that we have time for on the Jackbox.
[46:07.29]What did you guys think?
[46:08.61]That was a lot of fun.
[46:09.82]That was a good one.
[46:11.46]Debrief.
[46:11.72]Was it good?
[46:12.72]It was good.
[46:13.90]I enjoyed it.
[46:14.22]I need the music quieter.
[46:15.70]You can't hear my ears.
[46:17.78]GG!
[46:19.97]Somebody press the button.
[46:20.99]Kurt's doing a little dance.
[46:23.21]Can we get Kurt dancing?
[46:25.17]Guys, if we hit $1,100,000, Kurt will dance.
[46:29.31]Dance, dance, dance, dance.
[46:31.36]Well, we've got... What we're going to do now is... Well, let's have a look.
[46:38.82]We didn't get to read any donations at all.
[46:40.60]I assume we got them.
[46:41.79]Class, class.
[46:45.47]Sideshow, could you maybe just close the game?
[46:47.95]I can do.
[46:48.73]Yep.
[46:48.99]Are you sick of that music?
[46:51.31]No.
[46:51.86]No?
[46:53.03]My mom told me in my ear, turn off the darn music.
[46:56.37]Darn.
[46:58.52]Turn it down.
[46:59.20]So we're going to throw to an ad break, but we've still got stuff coming up, guys.
[47:03.24]And keep in mind, I don't know, buy a shirt, donate to Tip of the Hats, One Step Camp.
[47:08.85]It's a great cause.
[47:09.63]And guess what?
[47:10.05]We're going to show you why.
[47:10.91]Let's get back to the serious stuff.
[47:13.20]We're going to hit you with the One Step Camp video.
[47:16.22]We'll be right back after that.
[47:17.46]And we love you.
[47:20.47]As soon as you get here, like, you'll just have a blast.
[47:22.85]Like, right away, you're starting off, like, with fun activities.
[47:25.28]Like, you can go swimming, or you can do arts and crafts.
[47:27.61]We go on a lot of trips, and we fish, and we sleep in tents.
[47:32.32]We go to some lakes.
[47:33.32]It's pretty cool.
[47:34.71]You almost forget that you're just away from home because it's just so welcoming, so fun that you're doing all these activities.
[47:41.72]And it goes by so fast, and it's just such a fun, amazing time.
[47:45.08]I still have a lot of my friends I made my first year.
[47:48.41]I just kind of kept them all close.
[47:52.71]They're like family.
[47:53.67]They're not really friends.
[47:54.74]They're family to me.
[47:56.58]Here, you fit in just the same.
[47:59.96]We all had some type of cancer or brain tumor or something.
[48:04.37]So we're all the same.
[48:07.53]And it's not like you can pick them out in a crowd.
[48:10.14]Camp is a place where you can feel free to talk about your experience.
[48:14.72]But you don't have to feel like you have to answer any questions.
[48:17.73]And you just feel really comfortable.
[48:19.95]and embraced by all these welcoming people.
[48:22.77]I just love all the environments.
[48:24.80]It's so peaceful and so relaxing knowing that you always have somebody to lean on if you're sad and there's so many friends I made here.
[48:31.96]I get why it's like so nerve-wracking for some people because it's like when I was eight, I wasn't away from my parents for like a week.
[48:38.39]These people are my second family.
[48:40.81]I kind of have to come back.
[48:43.52]I want to come back.
[48:45.20]So don't worry.
[48:46.36]You're going to make a lot of friends here.
[48:51.71]Thank you.
