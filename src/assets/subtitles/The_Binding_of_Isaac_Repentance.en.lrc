[00:03.66]Dude, I just ripped out every single cord that was plugged into my computer.
[00:08.38]I'm not even kidding.
[00:09.48]I don't know what the hell that was.
[00:11.18]What was that all about?
[00:12.02]I'm sitting here completely normal.
[00:17.04]Like there was nothing wrong and all of a sudden I look over and I clicked on the start menu and it was just just scrolling.
[00:27.01]I wasn't scrolling.
[00:28.91]I unplugged my fucking mouse, my keyboard, and I opened up Binding of Isaac, and it was on two monitors.
[00:35.91]And the other monitor was going... What?
[00:41.33]I've been using this computer since I left.
[00:47.47]What was that for?
[00:48.55]Oh my god.
[00:56.88]Anyways, hello, how are you?
[00:57.86]Good to see you again.
[01:00.76]Hope you're doing well.
[01:03.06]I have returned from my absence.
[01:07.91]And we have, we have a lot of things to talk about.
[01:13.11]This is, this is a lot.
[01:16.95]Some of these things are really good.
[01:19.27]Some of these things I do.
[01:20.29]Hold on.
[01:20.62]Just let me just open up my thing.
[01:24.80]Ah, purple powerade.
[01:27.34]Oops.
[01:30.42]MonkaS.
[01:31.74]Well, don't MonkaS yet.
[01:32.76]You don't know what we're talking about.
[01:33.78]Shit, can I move this mic?
[01:35.52]Hold on.
[01:54.77]Is... Am I delayed?
[01:55.49]What do I have for a delay?
[02:01.22]Let me change that.
[02:01.76]It's been a while.
[02:02.62]Alright.
[02:10.15]No, I got no delay.
[02:10.75]I'm good.
[02:11.69]Okay.
[02:13.33]So, the first thing I'm going to talk about... Where do you start?
[02:16.63]I have to do... Okay, I have a book report right now.
[02:21.99]I'm up at the front of the class about to present my book report.
[02:25.58]And it's different.
[02:26.30]You're all teachers.
[02:28.44]I'm one student.
[02:29.40]You're all teachers.
[02:30.38]All of you.
[02:31.92]I got selected to do my book report in front of, like, the teacher's union.
[02:36.54]Because it was so good.
[02:38.84]And I'm up here like, okay, um, where do I start?
[02:42.59]George Washington had wood teeth.
[02:45.49]And he, uh, okay.
[02:48.61]So, let's start.
[02:49.91]Why not?
[02:51.23]But how do I, what should I put on in the background?
[02:55.39]I'm gonna say an F. Don't, don't F me here.
[02:59.49]I'm gonna get an F'd.
[03:05.81]Put on DOOM OST.
[03:08.54]Uh, let's like, hold on.
[03:10.12]Oh, we're gonna play Binding of Isaac because, uh, holy shit, Repentance is out.
[03:17.00]That's very surprising.
[03:18.20]That's really cool.
[03:20.44]Hold on.
[03:20.96]Unrecognized gamepad.
[03:22.14]Don't do this again.
[03:24.69]Oh God, the projector isn't working.
[03:27.95]I have my image that I got of the first image search of George Washington's on the fucking projector and it's glitching out on me.
[03:36.95]George Washington.
[03:37.69]Okay, there we go.
[03:38.21]This camera's not on, right?
[03:42.95]There we go.
[03:45.91]So...
[03:48.08]Uhhhh, what do I want to put here?
[03:49.08]Everything's going to be okay.
[03:51.08]You're the one teacher in the back that realizes that I have like a lot going on, I got a lot to talk about.
[03:58.08]Son, everything's going to be just fine.
[04:00.08]And I'm like: Oh? Yeah it is going to be just fine! Thanks Mr. Davidson!
[04:09.08]Mr. Davidson reaches in his pocket and he's got like a big flask and he just like...
[04:22.34]Alright, so let's just get started.
[04:23.58]I gave you a PR press release before.
[04:25.30]Those of you that read it, here's what we're gonna start right here.
[04:31.17]As of today, I'm gonna go over the medical stuff.
[04:35.47]So, medically speaking, the reason why I've been gone for so long, and the reason why I was gone a while back too, is to take my pain problem really seriously.
[04:46.92]And I've started to. I went in I had six injections into my spine-
[04:51.00]Well not my spine. That's a- that's a lie. Into my like spinal muscles - that was like not even real.
[04:59.00]Uh not into my spine. I had six injections into the muscles around my spine. They're called trigger point injections.
[05:08.90]They're supposed to alleviate some of the tension that I've been having in my chest and back that could be radiating, I could have trigger point problems, I could have myofascial pain syndrome, I could have costochondritis, I could have a hernia problem, I could have... the list goes on.
[05:24.56]This has been going on for three years, those of you that aren't aware of this.
[05:28.02]So I did those, and they helped a little bit, but it didn't fix the problem.
[05:33.85]The problem is still there.
[05:35.35]It hasn't gone away.
[05:37.11]It might never go away from what I've potentially been told.
[05:42.46]So what I have to end up doing now is start to really seriously treat this dead serious priority number one.
[05:51.14]And I want to do that without having to stop streaming.
[05:55.56]Because I don't want to just stop streaming.
[05:58.01]I've taken like these month-long breaks or these like, oh I'll be back in like three months.
[06:02.87]It sucks.
[06:03.23]I don't want to do that.
[06:04.67]Obviously because I don't want to just disappear.
[06:08.13]But I kind of have to do what I have to do.
[06:09.13]And on top of that um there's been some uh things going on with my family too that I need to really pay attention to.
[06:17.13]So they're kind of just jumping on top of each other and I need to take the- I need to make the decision essentially to dial back streaming and like dial back my presence on the internet, I guess you could say.
[06:32.76]I don't take this decision lightly.
[06:34.84]This is not something I'm like really, oh, I can't wait to like only stream once a week.
[06:38.96]But I have to really start to take this dead seriously.
[06:42.00]And if I can continue to stream once a week or so, or maybe once or twice a week, depending on what we're doing.
[06:51.43]I won't have to take these monster breaks.
[06:54.36]I can focus on going to maybe more intense physical therapy to try to work this out.
[07:00.46]Do more procedures.
[07:02.02]Get this stuff done and some of the other stuff going on in my personal life too without having to do like a three month break.
[07:09.41]And I think that's going to stay for a while.
[07:11.37]So this is not something that's going to be here for a couple weeks or like a month.
[07:17.43]I think this might be a potentially permanent change.
[07:21.11]to stream only once or twice a week.
[07:23.99]And I mean, I've been doing this for like 10 years.
[07:26.29]A lot of you know.
[07:28.31]And if I have to change things to be able to do it the way that I know I can, the way that I'm comfortable doing it, then I'm going to do that.
[07:35.02]I have to.
[07:37.28]If I wasn't going to make these changes, then I don't know if I would continue to be able to like want to stream, if I'm serious.
[07:45.19]Having to, like, have my brain in, like, three or four different places and, like, come on and do streams and stuff.
[07:49.09]It's just... It's something I don't think is gonna happen.
[07:53.03]He's done.
[07:53.69]No, I'm not done.
[07:55.39]I'm not done.
[07:56.39]I'm not retiring.
[07:58.43]This is not a I'm retiring stream.
[08:01.70]No, my career's not over, alright?
[08:03.78]It just got started.
[08:06.40]It's just getting... My career's just getting started.
[08:09.76]Says the guy in, like, the dirty overcoat.
[08:11.90]That's, like, running around outside yelling at, like, popular streamers.
[08:14.86]You know right now, my career just got started.
[08:18.62]And I reach in and grab the flask out of my, you know... Who the fuck's that weird guy over there?
[08:23.94]He keeps like running up and yelling at us.
[08:26.23]I think that's the... That's Jerma985.
[08:28.85]I've heard of him before.
[08:30.41]Yeah, you better have.
[08:36.17]I'll always remember you.
[08:40.58]The plan is to not have to do that, you understand?
[08:44.52]The plan here is take some of the stuff going on in my life really fucking seriously and continue to do the thing I like to do, which is this.
[08:54.33]And I know people are going to be concerned here, I know they are, about money.
[08:58.57]Oh my god, if you stop streaming, if you only stream like once a week or once in a while, what about all the subs?
[09:04.07]What about all the money?
[09:04.97]I never cared about that in the first place.
[09:09.51]If I did, you would have probably known that by now.
[09:12.97]Dropping, like, subs?
[09:15.71]Or losing, like, viewers or something?
[09:18.93]This channel has done so... Like, the view counts have been so ridiculous over the last year.
[09:25.25]The- the amount of people- the new people, the new community that this has kind of generated.
[09:30.25]It's overwhelming at times... but I was never in the game of trying to kind of min max my Twitch stats.
[09:38.25]I don't- that doesn't do it for me.
[09:41.25]I want to continue to have fun here and enjoy what I'm doing and in recently, it's very obvious.
[09:48.22]I can't, like, lie to you guys, but am I gonna pretend like this has not been a problem?
[09:52.11]The last, like, year or two, you've probably been very aware that it kind of, like, hurts to, like, exist.
[09:58.75]Like, my back and spine and chest, you've seen me with, like, the brace on.
[10:02.16]You've seen me wearing, like, the boomer brace and the chest piece.
[10:06.00]And, oh, I only stream for, like, a few hours at a time.
[10:08.24]Uh, get a standing desk.
[10:10.48]Oh, but even standing is kind of a pain in the ass, too.
[10:13.51]This is something that just hasn't gone away.
[10:15.57]I've been to the doctor a bunch of times.
[10:16.91]We're trying to figure out what exactly could it be.
[10:18.97]Is this something that's so simple and so easy, but nobody has fixed it yet?
[10:23.07]I don't know.
[10:24.17]But it's, I can't, I'm not going to lie.
[10:28.33]So, boomer pog.
[10:33.96]And don't, I also don't want anybody to twist this either.
[10:38.48]I'm okay.
[10:39.86]This is not a problem that is necessarily ruining my life.
[10:45.91]It's just something that's constantly there, that constantly has to stay in the front of my brain.
[10:51.48]So, while I'm doing anything,
[10:54.52]Half of my brain is like, hey, your chest hurts.
[10:57.92]And it's like, alright, well, fuck off, shut up, leave me alone.
[10:59.94]And the other half is like, hey, you're doing this thing.
[11:02.78]And especially with the increased activity that I've been doing recently, obviously, it gets a little nicer.
[11:08.35]And obviously, if COVID starts to get more under control, there's going to be a lot of shit going on here over the next four, five, six months, stream-wise.
[11:19.69]So I kind of have to be able to do these things without having it be a problem.
[11:24.01]So I'm trying desperately over these next six to 12 months to really, really focus on it.
[11:30.97]And to lead into that, why don't we talk about something else?
[11:35.30]Why don't we go from like, oh, once a week Andy, and now that's, oh no, he's retiring too.
[11:39.68]Hey, are you ready?
[11:42.84]Hey, what's he going to say?
[11:47.22]What am I going to say?
[11:49.23]What's the announcement?
[11:51.33]The announcement?
[11:52.21]Oh, I'm going to milk the shit out of this one.
[11:58.86]Grotto Beasts is real.
[12:04.44]It's going to be a real collectible trading card game that you will be able to buy.
[12:11.05]It's real.
[12:14.38]I have had to keep my fucking mouth shut about this for a while.
[12:20.50]But I want to kind of start to build some attention to it because eventually here, probably fairly soon, you're going to be able to buy your own Grotto Beasts packs.
[12:33.05]And what does that... We'll give you more details when that is, you know, more in the front of the brain, right?
[12:41.03]Of course it was real.
[12:42.03]It was made 40 years ago, yeah.
[12:45.41]But it's real in the sense of this channel.
[12:47.41]So... I cannot wait... to show you more details of what that is.
[12:58.00]You're doing NFT's? No, cards.
[13:01.00]Like you you get them in your hand. Physical card packs.
[13:05.00]What did I miss in the last 30 seconds? Somebody update that guy!
[13:05.00]Grotto Beasts is real. It's a real card pack opening game.
[13:14.96]Physical.
[13:15.66]We're not talking digital.
[13:16.34]We're talking physical cards.
[13:18.32]Coming soon.
[13:19.94]And, gonna be probably doing merch too.
[13:22.78]Grotto Beasts merch.
[13:24.16]I'm gonna wear this shit on stream.
[13:30.11]Razzle Puss Reel.
[13:34.97]Finally, merch.
[13:36.69]Well, I only do merch when it makes sense.
[13:40.06]And this makes sense.
[13:44.15]Sell-out streamer.
[13:48.39]Oh, I get it.
[13:49.39]Hold on, let me lean in and put my hand up to my mouth and lean in.
[13:52.55]I get it.
[13:53.61]He's only streaming once a week, and he's going to milk the fuck out of us for all of our money.
[13:58.93]Grotto Bees merchandise once a week, Andy.
[14:02.75]Fuck this guy.
[14:05.73]OMEGALUL True.
[14:07.19]No, no.
[14:09.01]We'll see.
[14:09.39]We'll see how cool it is.
[14:10.67]It seems like it's going to be really fun.
[14:13.12]Take it all.
[14:16.50]But that's big announcement number one.
[14:19.84]There you are.
[14:21.65]Now, the next thing I'm going to say is not necessarily an announcement as much as something really cool.
[14:27.11]When I was originally going to come back, I was going to show something that we're going to watch together right now.
[14:32.77]It is a video.
[14:35.47]This video... You know what?
[14:38.74]I don't think I'm even going to say anything about it.
[14:40.96]We're going to watch it right now.
[14:44.81]Are you ready?
[14:45.97]Are you ready for the premiere of Rat Movie?
[14:52.02]Rat Movie premiere?
[14:53.08]What does that mean?
[14:55.38]I thought you already did the Rat Movie.
[14:57.46]Like a long time ago.
[15:00.44]Bionicle.
[15:06.05]And joining me now, Joe Biden.
[15:11.45]Joe.
[15:11.53]Joe.
[15:14.95]Oh, you're there.
[15:17.83]I lost him.
[15:18.36]He's not on the line anymore.
[15:20.50]Oh, shoot.
[15:22.84]He was just on the phone.
[15:24.84]Kidding.
[15:25.70]Not real.
[15:26.36]That didn't happen.
[15:27.62]That's a fucking lie.
[15:30.17]Don't you guys remember?
[15:31.79]I forget how to stream.
[15:33.41]I forget how to be a live streamer when I take three weeks off, a month off.
[15:37.69]I'm just sitting here talking fucking nonsense.
[15:39.59]Alright, you ready?
[15:42.14]Let's go ahead and watch it.
[15:43.64]This is the Rat Movie, but unlike you probably have seen so far.
[15:49.89]A lot of work went into this.
[15:51.49]A lot of people had a lot to do with this.
[15:54.07]Let's just, let's go ahead and watch it.
[15:55.51]No more stalling.
[15:57.79]Here we go.
[16:06.60]No more stalling, I promise.
[16:08.84]Just one more second.
[16:14.25]Just one more minute.
[16:19.25]What is this this? Thiis not it. This is a fucking ad.
[16:23.25]This is a Liberty Mutual ad. It's not what I-
[16:28.00]Huge announcement! Liberty Mutual!
[16:34.00]Oh this game rules-
[16:35.00]How come I can't hear it? Why- wait why can I not hear this?
[16:39.29]Where's Johnny on the spot air conditioning in the last face?
[16:46.19]Where's the movie?
[16:49.00]Where's the movie?
[16:49.80]Hold on.
[16:56.08]I gotta turn off Isaac.
[16:58.46]On the spot air conditioning.
[17:00.88]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[17:02.32]Isaac is still playing.
[17:07.02]I'm really bad at this.
[17:12.36]Okay. Are we ready? We are ready. I'm ready now.
[17:15.00]Alright... In three... two... one.
[17:23.00]Rat Movie reanimated collab!
[17:33.79]Rats.
[17:34.67]We're rats.
[17:36.11]We're the rats.
[17:38.33]We prey at night, we stalk at night.
[17:40.92]We're the rats.
[17:42.34]Fuck off!
[17:43.52]I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules.
[17:47.96]Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.
[17:54.03]So sue me for being thorough.
[17:55.79]I want to know that you know what the plan is.
[17:58.17]Look, seriously, mate.
[17:59.93]How many artifacts do we need to steal before you trust me with these jobs?
[18:03.68]Well, I just want to make sure you know what's happening.
[18:05.86]We've got to get the treasure.
[18:07.12]We've got to get out of there.
[18:08.60]And we also have to... And we must get it.
[18:12.85]That's the most important thing.
[18:14.17]So be on your A game.
[18:15.31]We go now.
[18:17.85]I get to drive the car today because it's my birthday.
[18:20.29]No, don't let him get in the car.
[18:21.93]Please don't let him.
[18:22.89]Come on, it's my birthday.
[18:24.07]He's driving, whatever.
[18:25.01]Bloody hell.
[18:26.01]Oi, more importantly, since when did we have a rat problem?
[18:29.49]We don't.
[18:30.31]Get in.
[18:32.43]Let's go.
[18:32.99]Speed it up.
[18:34.21]Yeah, that's the speed I'm looking for.
[18:36.41]That's the type of fastness I want.
[18:37.95]I don't even know where you're going at this point.
[18:42.27]We've been driving all night.
[18:43.68]That's my birthday.
[18:45.02]Hey, you... You just... You're running over a guy right now.
[18:49.31]Are you fucking serious?
[18:53.59]Remind me next time we do this.
[18:54.97]I'll get my nan to drive.
[19:01.31]Um, excuse me, sir.
[19:02.41]Yeah, you over the dancing.
[19:03.39]It's actually $10 to dance in this building.
[19:06.05]You're gonna have to give me...
[19:08.66]Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, may I have the attention of the class.
[19:12.67]My name is Dick Dastardly Richard, and I'm here to take the treasure chest that's in the back room.
[19:18.37]Go get it, boys.
[19:19.58]I'll follow you in.
[19:21.20]And let me tell you something, clerk.
[19:23.10]If you so as move a muscle, I'll make sure you stay buried in that ground there.
[19:28.97]Alright, let's go.
[19:36.12]Alright, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[19:37.92]Is the treasure in there?
[19:38.82]Is it in there?
[19:39.76]Yep, it's all here.
[19:41.54]Oh, yes!
[19:42.90]Now that's what I like to hear.
[19:44.60]And now we are invincible!
[19:46.80]Not so fast!
[19:49.08]You stand before Gerard, guardian of the treasure chest of the Mayan temple.
[19:54.49]And I will make sure to grab... Hey!
[19:57.21]Oh, fuck this.
[19:57.99]I'm off.
[19:58.29]Hey, what... What are you doing?
[20:04.52]At night, we stalk at night.
[20:06.38]We're the rats.
[20:07.86]Alright.
[20:08.26]Yeah, that's cool.
[20:09.06]Yeah, I like rats.
[20:10.00]Nothing bad with rats.
[20:11.40]But let me tell you something.
[20:13.00]Over my dead body, are you getting this treasure?
[20:15.34]Rats.
[20:16.20]Rats.
[20:17.08]Rats.
[20:17.88]Rats.
[20:18.50]Rats.
[20:18.76]Rats.
[20:19.14]Look at that flock of birds over there.
[20:21.16]That reminds me of my favorite movie, The Movie.
[20:25.17]And that's your favorite movie too, right?
[20:27.57]Yo, my favorite movie is Frozen.
[20:29.49]I like Elsa and Anna.
[20:30.79]Okay, now I kill you.
[20:35.65]Wow, that's a great pick choice for a favorite in this movie.
[20:39.19]I wonder if I have to think that now.
[20:41.84]Now I get to be the giant rat.
[20:43.52]Cool, surprise!
[20:45.90]So you're trying to tell me that inside of this building right here, there is a giant rat.
[20:50.10]Among other things, the giant pickles.
[20:52.02]Did he say pickles?
[20:53.26]Or am I putting that in there by myself?
[20:55.04]Whatever, Sergeant Pickles is going to go in here and check it out.
[20:57.52]We're going to make sure everything's okay.
[20:59.23]And give me some candy corn, too.
[21:00.81]That's a weird request, I know, but just get it.
[21:03.07]You guys are going to drop it and we're going to be in big trouble.
[21:05.55]So quit messing around.
[21:06.74]I hear somebody coming.
[21:07.42]Put it down.
[21:07.78]Put it down.
[21:09.04]Get in.
[21:10.94]Hello, sir.
[21:12.04]Welcome to the rat cafe.
[21:13.48]There's no rats here.
[21:15.08]It's just hamburgers.
[21:17.10]That would be real nice if that were true.
[21:19.85]Except it isn't.
[21:21.29]You're a rat, aren't you?
[21:24.24]No, no, why would that happen?
[21:26.34]We're just people.
[21:28.28]And I'm gonna be taking you in.
[21:30.60]Wouldn't it be funny if this were real?
[21:32.58]I'm just kidding.
[21:33.70]Be careful, though.
[21:34.42]There's apparently a giant rat around.
[21:36.68]You have a good day, officer.
[21:41.31]So, you figure anything out in there?
[21:43.47]Nah, he's clean.
[21:44.45]Let's back to the drawing board.
[21:47.05]Well, that's great.
[21:47.99]I don't know how to draw, so you're gonna have to do the drawing.
[22:01.91]Sergeant Scritchy-Scratch of the Cat Police reporting in.
[22:05.66]You are now relieved of your duty.
[22:07.26]Absolutely, Sergeant.
[22:08.24]You've got it.
[22:08.82]We'll be taking off now.
[22:10.32]Thank you for your continued work.
[22:12.16]Thank you.
[22:12.74]Your duty will not go unnoticed.
[22:16.46]What's that on you?
[22:17.68]What?
[22:18.36]Are you wearing a rat on your shoulder?
[22:20.15]Why would I be wearing... What the fuck?
[22:22.13]Let me just...
[22:24.03]Boss, we got big problems.
[22:25.33]The cat police are here.
[22:26.55]Are you kidding me right now, cat police?
[22:28.61]Get us the fuck out of here.
[22:29.93]Drive the car.
[22:31.21]Get us out.
[22:32.33]Let's speed it up.
[22:33.51]We got to get the fuck out of here.
[22:36.41]Come on, gentlemen.
[22:38.11]Cat police.
[22:42.91]Good job, cat police.
[22:44.11]You did it again.
[22:44.83]You saved the world.
[22:46.41]And that's what we do as cat police.
[22:48.81]We make the world a better...
[22:59.09]Whoa!
[23:01.01]What the fuck?
[23:04.26]What's happening?
[23:06.06]Where am I?
[23:10.98]That was awesome.
[23:14.42]That was awesome.
[23:16.35]There you go.
[23:16.77]There was Rat Movie: Mystery of the Mayan Treasure fully animated.
[23:23.60]Reimagining of the whole thing.
[23:29.00]Let's go over who made that possible. All these people.
[23:35.00]That was absolutely fantastic.
[23:41.00]Uh this video is now going to be probably public on the 2nd channel, if you want to watch it again.
[23:52.42]We are all rats.
[23:54.50]But yeah, that was... I was going to show that like last week.
[24:05.10]But some other things kind of were happening.
[24:08.43]Had to delay.
[24:08.97]This is my two... This is a 2,000 subscriber video?
[24:12.69]Yeah.
[24:21.86]Burgah Boy!
[24:22.44]You know, I forgot that Burgah Boy eats a cheeseburger in that video as fast as he can.
[24:28.15]I forgot about that.
[24:28.77]I forgot the password.
[24:30.49]That's a funny meme.
[24:42.55]You know, that's a funny meme, but here's the funny, here's the actual sad, funny part about what you just said.
[24:47.70]Um, I have not logged into my Jerma985 account probably in so long that it would not register the IP as being mine.
[24:55.42]It'd probably be like, dog, alert, fraud activity.
[24:59.46]Somebody is trying to log into your account from Las Vegas?
[25:05.32]Holy shit, this has to be a fucking hacker.
[25:10.92]Yeah, but excellent work.
[25:13.99]Chestnut is the one that organized it and put it all together.
[25:16.29]Good stuff.
[25:20.96]And that is that.
[25:21.62]Is there a final, like, sus face?
[25:30.18]There you go.
[25:32.28]I think that might be public now on the second channel.
[25:37.40]You are the sus face.
[25:43.15]But, uh, Repentance came out.
[25:45.53]I was going to play The Sims 1, but I really wanted to give some time here to talk about everything and talk to you guys.
[25:55.99]It's still premiering?
[25:57.49]Oh.
[25:57.99]Well, you'll see it later.
[26:02.29]You're living what?
[26:03.20]Maybe the sus was because of friends we made along the way.
[26:08.20]But long story short, and also by the way,
[26:12.29]There are other streams right now being worked on.
[26:15.09]Do not take me saying that I'm going to be a... And by the way, when I say once a week, I mean scheduled once a week.
[26:22.98]The same day, the same time every week.
[26:26.05]So no more...
[26:27.73]Oh, maybe it'll be on Monday.
[26:29.39]I guess maybe I'll see you on Thursday.
[26:31.65]And then maybe Friday.
[26:33.11]This is going to be a schedule.
[26:35.59]Every time at the same point, same place.
[26:37.86]Now how this becomes something I need to work on is when is that going to be?
[26:43.97]When should I do this once a week?
[26:46.14]Maybe one to two days in a row.
[26:48.62]Should it be... Saturday?
[26:51.88]Should it be Sunday?
[26:53.63]And I think the idea is to do one more of these on Saturday.
[26:57.65]And then...
[26:59.61]Maybe do like some polls and see what you guys have to say.
[27:02.33]Maybe we can see when the most people are around for that once a week.
[27:05.73]That's a hundred subs.
[27:06.77]Yeah.
[27:07.03]Holy shit.
[27:08.87]It was PQ.
[27:10.57]PQ.
[27:12.79]PQ?
[27:13.49]Am I saying that right?
[27:19.96]A hundred subs.
[27:21.22]Community subs.
[27:21.94]Yeah.
[27:24.14]Saturday.
[27:24.58]Definitely Saturday.
[27:28.89]Yeah, it'll probably end up being on the weekend.
[27:30.47]Because the weekend obviously is the most... Probably the most people can watch anyways.
[27:34.86]And I'm going to try to make it early enough.
[27:37.04]So some of the EU crowd is not going to have to... Oh, it's Saturday.
[27:41.52]Can't wait for Saturday at 4pm.
[27:43.16]Well, that's the one time a week that it's going to be live and I'll never see it.
[27:47.51]So most likely Saturday... not early in the morning but somewhere around probably 12 pacific.
[27:55.86]I think 12 p.m pacific on Saturday is a perfect place for it.
[28:02.86]There's 22000 people here, holy shit. Well, what's up guys?
[28:09.86]But what I was going to say before I cut my- I keep cutting myself off mid-sentence.
[28:15.70]Just because I'm going to be streaming less does not mean that there's not still stuff going to happen.
[28:20.92]It's not like, oh, here we go once a week.
[28:23.26]Forget about all the other shit that I was going to do and all the plans I had.
[28:26.59]I'm just going to like open up fucking Isaac for like a couple hours or whatever Saturday and then see you later.
[28:33.25]No, there's still tons of shit going on.
[28:34.53]There's tons of projects, tons of interesting things that I think are going to be really fun.
[28:39.31]A few big streams are in the works right now.
[28:42.38]And they're going to happen.
[28:44.06]And I just want to take the time necessary to make sure that I can comfortably continue to do this and still enjoy doing it at the same time.
[28:53.04]And I just tapped all of my fingers.
[28:54.28]I'm tapping it on the desk like this.
[28:55.58]I'm really, I'm at the podium giving you guys a speech.
[29:00.54]So Catboy is confirmed.
[29:02.38]Yes.
[29:04.54]I mean, just, you're going to, it'll be on Saturday.
[29:07.07]Well, not, no, no, no.
[29:07.75]Like, it'll be on a Saturday.
[29:09.93]It's just, you'll know.
[29:13.05]With all that being said, let's continue to do some of the things I want to do today.
[29:20.56]I want to play the new Isaac.
[29:21.96]It's been a long time.
[29:22.88]I'm waiting for this to come out.
[29:24.50]I'm excited to try it and mess around.
[29:29.42]But I hope I could give enough details on some things that you guys understand kind of where I'm coming from.
[29:36.31]Because my 10-year anniversary is coming up in June, right?
[29:39.29]June or July.
[29:41.41]Not 10 years on Twitch, but 10 years on the internet as an e-clown.
[29:45.69]And as we cross this 10-year period and I start to get a little older, I want to make sure that the medical stuff continues to be a thing.
[29:54.36]I really want to make sure it's something I want to continue to do and that I'm still having fun doing.
[29:59.22]Because that's what keeps me here at the end of the day, is that.
[30:03.24]Am I having fun doing this?
[30:04.40]Do I still want to be here?
[30:05.36]Am I still enjoying myself when I'm here?
[30:07.68]That has to continue to be yes or I'm not going to do it.
[30:12.07]Got to be very clear.
[30:13.89]So doing this is the way that I'm able to do that.
[30:19.00]70-year anniversary.
[30:23.06]When are you going to do a Jeremy Elbertson facecam?
[30:30.00]Do what you need to do.
[30:30.62]Yeah.
[30:30.88]And look, eventually here, as the years go by,
[30:37.30]I don't have a plan, right?
[30:39.90]I'm going to keep doing this as long as I'm still being able to and enjoy it and stuff.
[30:43.52]I don't have a plan.
[30:45.16]It's not like, oh, in five years, I can't wait to be this, this, this, this, this.
[30:50.45]No, I'm just doing this, and I'm just here.
[30:56.01]So let's go ahead and pull this up now.
[30:59.47]Back to Binding of Isaac.
[31:01.25]I've been looking forward to playing this.
[31:05.18]Put the volume up a little.
[31:07.84]I have not played one second of this new expansion, so I'm looking forward to it.
[31:12.71]I hope I have the... Last time I played Isaac, I had a save file, right?
[31:21.51]Among Us.
[31:27.24]You peeked at Among Us.
[31:29.14]I didn't peek at Among Us.
[31:31.08]I've never played Among Us.
[31:34.69]Don't you understand?
[31:35.45]I can't use the controller.
[31:39.93]There we go.
[31:42.16]Alright, let's go.
[31:42.84]New run.
[31:43.22]Oh, he's annoyed.
[31:46.10]I've never played Among Us.
[31:51.08]I was ripped into a meme that I didn't even know was going to be a thing.
[31:54.71]And then I became the Among Us sus guy.
[31:57.65]I didn't peek at Among Us.
[32:02.08]That had nothing to do with me.
[32:03.16]That wasn't even my face.
[32:04.12]That was manipulated to a point where it wasn't even me.
[32:06.98]What do you think?
[32:07.50]Cane?
[32:10.92]I usually do... Let's go Cane.
[32:16.70]Among Us peeked at you.
[32:20.73]Oh, shit.
[32:24.01]Wait, why?
[32:24.73]What is going on here?
[32:28.77]Why am I the second player?
[32:33.05]What?
[32:36.55]Oh my fucking god.
[32:42.39]Dude, I... How did I activate co-op?
[32:48.86]I didn't do anything.
[32:54.40]Is the controller fucking broken?
[32:58.47]What?
[33:01.97]What on Earth just happened?
[33:07.73]Do I have to- I can't play keyboard and mouse with Isaac.
[33:10.09]No way!
[33:13.25]What?
[33:18.99]Hold on a second.
[33:19.81]This thing doesn't work anymore.
[33:20.89]Control disconnected.
[33:25.50]Re-press any button.
[33:26.52]What the fuck?
[33:29.74]I don't know why this keeps hap- There's something going on with this slot.
[33:32.82]Oh no.
[33:37.01]This is the Xbox One, but it shouldn't be doing this.
[33:41.03]Stream canceled.
[33:45.12]I'll see you next Saturday.
[33:47.24]Once a week.
[33:48.96]I have no idea why this is happening.
[33:53.19]Have you guys noticed?
[33:54.43]I swear to God there's a fucking conspiracy here.
[33:57.27]I'm gonna go off on conspiracy shit right now.
[34:00.33]They have made all USB cables worse over the last five years.
[34:05.03]Do you remember?
[34:06.27]I used to have the same USB cable, the same lightning cable, for fucking decades, and they worked fine.
[34:14.16]These new USB cables, they degrade so rapidly.
[34:18.34]It's on purpose.
[34:23.04]I have not gone through
[34:25.55]I've gone through so many USB cables the last year than I have in the last 10 straight years.
[34:32.16]What happened?
[34:36.22]And lightning cables, like iPhone cables.
[34:39.44]What are they doing?
[34:40.28]Alright, I gotta find a new cable.
[34:44.44]Can you do Bluetooth with them?
[34:45.76]Can I do wireless with the Xbox controller?
[34:47.83]Oh my God, what a pain in the ass.
[34:50.87]Yeah, but see, I can't even get out of here.
[34:53.41]Press any button.
[34:55.23]I'm stuck in this, I'm stuck here.
[34:57.07]Why?
[34:59.51]Hold on.
[35:01.67]Fuck.
[35:04.47]Every USB cable I have is broken.
[35:07.50]All of them.
[35:10.94]How can every USB cable be broken?
[35:16.00]What material are you using for a materia?
[35:22.47]Whatever, that's from Final Fantasy.
[35:23.99]I don't even care.
[35:30.50]I don't think I have another cable.
[35:46.15]I don't think I have another cable.
[35:47.51]I don't think I have another cable.
[35:49.91]Alright, relax, dad.
[35:56.47]I don't think I even have, where's my tool?
[35:59.53]Where's my toolbox?
[36:01.17]I'm looking for a screwdriver.
[36:02.76]Alright, I got one.
[36:14.76]Okay, this is USB-C.
[36:17.09]Why do they have so many different USBs?
[36:19.47]Just make one.
[36:21.38]Micro USB, mini USB, USB-C, USB 2.0, USB 3.0.
[36:26.77]Just have one fucking cable.
[36:28.51]One cable.
[36:29.53]One USB cable.
[36:30.61]Why is there seven?
[36:32.29]Who's doing this?
[36:34.15]Stop them.
[36:36.45]We're going to get Congress.
[36:37.83]We're going to get Congress involved.
[36:55.00]Be right back. Everybody hold on. It's literally right in the next room.
[36:59.00]Oh my god this is what happens when- ugh.
[37:02.00]He's mentally deranged - I'm fine! I'll be right back!
[38:38.50]Okay.
[38:40.02]I found one.
[38:40.50]I found a USB cable.
[38:44.82]And this one works.
[38:47.08]Remember, we went through three.
[38:53.35]Is this what it's like to get old?
[38:54.29]I think I just ran on a treadmill for like an hour.
[38:59.05]Okay.
[39:01.03]Now what?
[39:05.45]What is going on now?
[39:06.69]Does it think I'm... It thinks I'm... How do I fix this?
[39:26.42]Alright, die!
[39:30.23]Wait, who am I?
[39:32.65]Am I player two?
[39:36.39]Restart.
[39:41.69]New game.
[39:43.51]I want to be Kane on Hard.
[39:52.68]Dude, I just- What the fuck is happening?
[39:57.62]What is it doing this?
[40:01.08]What?
[40:03.00]What the fuck is happening?
[40:05.00]Restart the whole game? I can't even hit any buttons.
[40:07.00]Why is this- how many people can play together?! Why does it think there's five people in the room? What is happening?
[40:21.00]Why is it that- I am now using the controller.
[40:23.00]Who am I controlling? I'm multiplying. But why? Why am I multiplying?
[40:36.50]Why are there three Isaacs?
[40:38.98]What?
[40:42.18]Can I use this to my advantage?
[40:43.22]Start button spamming.
[40:51.30]Go into the menu.
[40:53.14]I can't even go in the menu.
[40:58.22]Restart the whole game.
[41:00.14]Use one hand.
[41:02.28]How come I can't even hit escape?
[41:04.96]Just restart the whole game, Martin.
[41:14.32]Alt-F4.
[41:15.26]Yeah, but why is that happening?
[41:16.44]Okay, Alt-F4.
[41:22.54]Alright, somebody help me here.
[41:23.48]What's going on?
[41:24.28]Your computer's infected.
[41:29.99]Isaac and Isaac with his Isaac.
[41:31.49]This is what happens when Dremel gets too high.
[41:35.45]Windows Settings.
[41:36.81]Okay.
[41:37.09]Go into Windows Settings.
[41:44.65]Your PC has encountered sussware.
[41:46.19]But why would it be?
[41:48.93]You might have had two controllers plugged in, but you don't realize.
[41:52.13]No way!
[41:52.83]That's not even fucking possible.
[41:56.15]That's impossible.
[41:59.04]You were fucking with the controls while the game was open.
[42:01.06]What?
[42:02.46]Only press start with the controller you want to play with as player one.
[42:05.54]Yeah, that's what I did, and I loaded into the game, and then I was player two.
[42:12.91]Be patient, chat.
[42:13.75]He's bald.
[42:15.57]Blow on the cartridge.
[42:16.42]Alright, hold on.
[42:17.04]Enable, enable.
[42:17.80]Wait, wait.
[42:18.04]Enable, enable.
[42:20.46]It's not the USB.
[42:21.36]It's the game.
[42:21.88]I had the same issue.
[42:22.74]Unplug your Xbox controller and exit the game.
[42:25.12]Okay.
[42:25.38]Alright, let's go back in.
[42:29.03]I've unplugged it and I've plugged it back in.
[42:31.49]Does it work?
[42:39.94]Okay, I'm in the game.
[42:42.55]I have the controller in my hand.
[42:44.41]I'm using the analog right now.
[42:46.69]This is the controller.
[42:48.37]Controller is now activated.
[42:50.61]New game.
[42:52.55]I am now playing as Kane.
[42:54.21]This is the controller.
[42:55.43]Kane.
[43:02.78]Okay, what the hell happened?
[43:11.62]Alright, so this is The Binding of Isaac Repentance.
[43:14.40]I'm already angry at it.
[43:15.90]I'm already, like, very upset right now.
[43:17.96]Oh, there's all these new features.
[43:23.81]Okay, we're good.
[43:26.69]Please tell Jerma every time you want.
[43:28.29]It's because you plugged in the controller after starting the game, probably.
[43:31.57]No, because I was...
[43:35.20]Did you actually have four players in the game?
[43:37.38]Or was that a weird bug?
[43:38.86]Did I just... Hold on.
[43:41.93]Did we just find a potential like speedrun thing to do?
[43:46.93]To be able to just have like four Isaacs?
[43:50.19]And just somehow have a bunch of devices hooked up to you where you control them all?
[43:56.02]The multiplayer was... You were a little ghost, right?
[43:59.93]No, you're not special.
[44:00.99]Shit.
[44:03.60]Alright, let me get into this.
[44:04.46]I love this game.
[44:05.22]I have more time in this than any other game on Steam.
[44:07.54]Besides CF2.
[44:08.14]It's a fact.
[44:09.62]You want me to prove it?
[44:10.84]Take my word for it.
[44:11.52]I'm not fucking showing you.
[44:12.48]I don't care.
[44:15.76]It's upgraded multiplayer.
[44:17.99]Oh, wow.
[44:18.35]That's awesome, actually.
[44:20.49]Is it online or is it co-op only?
[44:21.79]Because it was co-op only for the longest time, right?
[44:24.98]Gain's got better pills?
[44:26.44]No, he doesn't.
[44:28.74]He doesn't care about us.
[44:31.53]Oh, he's got remote play?
[44:32.37]Okay.
[44:34.37]I guess it would be hard with lag to do this, right?
[44:38.91]The music is terrible.
[44:41.71]Oh, that is Scorpio Poison Tears.
[44:44.40]That's pretty good stat.
[44:45.68]That's pretty good stat.
[44:50.34]Why can't I go in here?
[44:53.31]You no longer need keys to go into... That's a weird change.
[44:57.01]You don't need a key anymore?
[45:03.00]Really?
[45:04.54]Not the first shop.
[45:05.88]Oh, wow.
[45:06.40]That's insane.
[45:08.46]That's a really good... That's a good change.
[45:12.12]Although, does it really matter?
[45:12.96]Because getting more than 15 coins on the first floor is pretty rare to do anyways, right?
[45:18.13]But I guess it's better.
[45:19.01]Alright.
[45:21.17]New coin noise.
[45:21.85]I don't think I like it.
[45:27.70]But what I was saying... Anybody know of the new stuff?
[45:31.80]Do I need... Do I need to have beaten the game a certain way a bunch of times to have the new stuff unlocked or... Because I don't know where this actually sits.
[45:46.14]I know that I've beaten the game probably like 40 times on this save file.
[45:49.68]That's the thing with Isaac.
[45:50.50]I have so many save files.
[45:52.67]I have a ton of time on the Switch.
[45:55.51]I have a ton of time on the PC.
[46:00.83]Gotta kill something three times.
[46:06.84]Three times beaten.
[46:07.86]You just have to beat the game 120 times to get the character unlocks.
[46:13.04]Because on the Switch version, I have a ton of time.
[46:15.80]I've beaten Gradier Mode on every character and stuff, but I don't think I've done it once on the PC version.
[46:19.70]So we'll see what happens.
[46:20.52]Alright, let's go.
[46:22.14]Wait, one more.
[46:22.80]Okay.
[46:27.56]We're on extra HUD.
[46:28.48]Oh, that's right.
[46:28.95]Why is that not on?
[46:33.63]I just gave somebody an absolute heart attack by putting that on.
[46:37.02]Can you imagine that, like, just like the pixels changing from where the F is to where N is, right?
[46:44.52]Like, OFF to ON just caused somebody a fucking breakdown.
[46:49.98]Think about that.
[46:51.26]Interesting.
[46:52.76]The gamma up to 120.
[46:53.32]Oh, yeah, the pop-ups, active cam, extra high.
[47:01.25]There we go.
[47:03.50]Mini.
[47:03.78]HUD offset.
[47:07.46]Ooh.
[47:07.68]I didn't know you could do this.
[47:08.88]I kind of want it like there.
[47:13.10]Found HUD.
[47:14.62]I thought this said garbage bars.
[47:16.30]Is it too bright?
[47:19.63]I like it.
[47:19.97]Maybe 110.
[47:20.99]115.
[47:21.09]Found HUD on.
[47:26.49]Let's give it a try.
[47:29.31]Oh, yeah.
[47:30.27]That's much better.
[47:34.00]Turn the charge bars on, too.
[47:35.04]No, I like to guess.
[47:37.70]Die!
[47:38.02]Is it going to get me through?
[47:44.13]Yes, it is.
[47:48.11]Charge bars show things like brimstone.
[47:50.27]Yeah, but for me, they distract me.
[47:53.73]I'm not going in that room.
[47:58.97]And I know so many people are going to watch me play this, and they're going to say... Oh my god, just run into the boss room, hurry up!
[48:06.24]Dude, go to the boss room!
[48:07.46]And I'm going to be like, no.
[48:10.36]I want to individually go and hit the poops.
[48:13.02]And look around and stuff.
[48:14.84]And people are going to say... God, it takes me 20 minutes to get through this.
[48:18.82]It's been an hour for him.
[48:22.18]That's what we do here.
[48:23.14]That's how you have to watch me stream games.
[48:25.78]What would normally take you 40 minutes will take me 2 hours.
[48:29.38]That's just the way it is.
[48:30.98]That's the way it is.
[48:31.72]And you're here.
[48:32.26]Don't leave.
[48:34.38]Don't, please.
[48:34.86]I'll go faster.
[48:36.60]I promise.
[48:40.00]Watch this.
[48:40.36]Ready?
[48:45.40]Tears.
[48:45.72]Oh, good.
[48:46.02]Tears up.
[48:46.46]That's good.
[48:46.86]Let's move.
[48:48.20]I know people.
[48:48.64]I'm going to miss tinted rocks.
[48:50.05]I know.
[48:55.83]Isaac is underrated.
[48:59.23]I don't know if I agree with that.
[49:00.17]I think a lot of people love this game.
[49:03.93]What's this thing on the right?
[49:04.89]That purple thing?
[49:07.71]What is that?
[49:09.77]A little purple hook?
[49:12.97]Did I pick that up?
[49:15.63]Oh, it's the curse.
[49:16.49]Okay.
[49:20.38]I love this game.
[49:23.79]I know that Edmund McMillan said that this is the last Isaac expansion.
[49:38.62]This game is so fun and everybody loves this game so much.
[49:41.56]I almost kind of feel bad in a way.
[49:43.81]Because he's just like, oh fuck, this game is so fun.
[49:46.69]Everybody loves this and it's an amazing creation.
[49:49.69]I have to make more of them.
[49:51.65]I have to continue to make them.
[49:59.79]He said that he was going to make a 2 eventually.
[50:04.53]In 3D?
[50:06.49]Because he can pull that.
[50:07.82]He could go to 3D.
[50:09.36]Right?
[50:09.72]It could be like Super Nintendo going to N64.
[50:11.84]We could have N64 graphics with Binding of Isaac 2.
[50:18.64]I'm not talking 3D like now 3D.
[50:20.28]I'm talking like Nintendo 64.
[50:22.84]Do I want the key?
[50:25.35]No.
[50:32.29]Still got it.
[50:39.03]I love the poison.
[50:45.03]Welcome back, Gerbo.
[50:47.57]Ooh, wait.
[50:48.21]Don't use it.
[50:48.59]How is he not getting hit?
[50:52.70]Because I am a living demigod.
[50:57.84]Mom's locket, you feel her love.
[51:03.80]What does mom's locket do?
[51:04.68]I don't know.
[51:09.79]Doesn't this open somehow?
[51:15.14]More hearts?
[51:15.80]The locket opens, doesn't it?
[51:20.41]Opening things will heal you.
[51:22.48]Oh.
[51:23.42]Oh, okay.
[51:25.60]Really?
[51:26.30]You had to make, like, the funny breathe-in joke?
[51:29.46]You just don't get hit.
[51:30.70]Like, I could have avoided that.
[51:31.68]I had to do, like, the funny look at my breathing pattern.
[51:35.93]Stupid.
[51:41.73]Go to the shop?
[51:42.31]I don't have enough money.
[51:42.97]Ooh, rainbow poop!
[51:47.58]That's a full heal, right?
[51:48.48]Yeah.
[51:50.18]What hit it?
[51:55.29]You should be ashamed.
[51:56.27]That's why I said it.
[51:56.99]I am ashamed.
[51:57.59]I would even attempt that.
[52:00.13]Use diaper.
[52:00.83]Use stink.
[52:03.61]That's something to do with flies, right?
[52:04.73]Remember, you're not streaming.
[52:08.06]You forgot to click the stream button.
[52:12.94]That's better.
[52:15.10]Chance to get hearts when opening stuff or a poo-poo.
[52:20.40]Where are the hearts?
[52:26.47]Nope, not doing that.
[52:27.13]Remember, we can't see the game.
[52:36.43]That would take some serious discipline from you guys to not say that.
[52:40.00]Besides the one person that just did.
[52:41.48]Are you going to scream from the retirement home?
[52:50.13]No.
[52:51.97]Absolutely not.
[52:55.25]Another joke is made that, oh, man, I'm going to stream forever.
[52:58.35]I'm going to be 70.
[52:59.37]No, I'm not.
[53:00.19]No.
[53:02.69]Guys, I will be long gone well before my 70th birthday.
[53:10.73]Oh, is this the ghost pepper?
[53:12.78]Lame tears.
[53:13.56]Oh, nice.
[53:15.22]These explode, though, don't they?
[53:19.27]Why can't we grow old together?
[53:20.41]Hey, you want to hear something really sad?
[53:24.98]When you guys are 70, I'll be dead.
[53:40.50]Holy fuck!
[53:42.94]Yeah guys, you understand?
[53:44.08]When you're like 80 years old, I will have been dead for probably 20 years.
[53:48.55]How old are you?
[53:50.65]We're at 20?
[53:52.29]Set at 19?
[53:54.43]The most age group here is like 18 to 24.
[53:56.43]Did I miss something?
[54:02.06]What did I miss?
[54:05.44]I'll go in the shop now.
[54:10.60]Hmm... That thing halves all damage, right?
[54:18.24]Oh, shit.
[54:20.75]Okay.
[54:25.07]Don't put that on.
[54:27.09]That's something that reduces damage?
[54:32.38]That's like the... No, when you die, something happens and you die.
[54:34.74]Oh, they changed a bunch of stuff.
[54:41.72]Alright, I'm gonna get the bag.
[54:44.98]Nice.
[54:45.22]That's a good return.
[54:47.34]Except it wasn't.
[54:50.14]People are gonna be really mad about this.
[54:56.37]Okay, should I get it?
[54:57.07]I don't have an active.
[54:59.93]Eh, it's not worth it.
[55:01.41]I'll save it.
[55:01.71]Alright, I'm gonna go to the boss.
[55:10.40]I am furious.
[55:11.18]19 gang here.
[55:12.38]19 gang.
[55:17.60]Um, alright.
[55:19.86]Monstro.
[55:22.66]Sometimes you gotta use a fucking nice, quick, utilized bomb.
[55:26.75]Although look at us with default enemies.
[55:33.61]That was kind of not worth it.
[55:36.37]That does a lot of damage.
[55:37.89]Does this stick on him?
[55:40.58]Holy shit, that's insane.
[55:41.54]That was a ton of damage.
[55:43.36]Alright, this is luck up and keys, right?
[55:48.02]Alright, and I got... Why are those blinking?
[55:58.29]Why are the black hearts blinking?
[56:02.69]Oh, you never give one heart for a little familiar.
[56:06.74]A new animation.
[56:07.40]Oh, they explode?
[56:13.20]Alright, let's go.
[56:16.94]Five-year-old.
[56:18.18]Isaac 2 with N64 PS1 graphics.
[56:20.36]They're similar.
[56:21.78]Yeah, I would be okay with that.
[56:25.45]I think that'd be pretty cool.
[56:26.19]Bro, we're not 20s.
[56:30.65]Yeah, not everybody here is in their 20s.
[56:33.71]19.
[56:33.79]Alright, let's spend it.
[56:46.31]Did they change the slot machine at all?
[56:48.31]Alright, I'll take it down to 10.
[56:55.21]That's it.
[56:56.39]Alright, blow it up so I don't get tempted to do it again.
[56:59.95]Perfect.
[57:03.55]Uh, ooh.
[57:08.15]That one's really good.
[57:09.69]That's the one that does your tears damage instantly when you spend a coin, right?
[57:13.29]That one's awesome.
[57:17.39]It sucks?
[57:18.09]What do you mean it sucks?
[57:20.53]No, for fucking idiots like me, I just get a million coins and I go to a boss and I go and the boss dies.
[57:28.72]That item is trash.
[57:29.94]Whatever.
[57:32.30]Map is probably more useful, yeah.
[57:40.20]Excuse me.
[57:44.05]Mr. Green.
[57:47.18]Get out of here.
[57:52.42]Hey.
[57:52.84]Okay, good.
[57:56.20]Cool.
[57:57.97]How many items have they changed?
[58:00.81]And how can you be so certain that these items are what you think they are?
[58:03.45]This is brand new content.
[58:04.61]There's a lot of nerfs, too.
[58:13.66]Let's go down.
[58:21.48]Remember, you don't have any new unlocks.
[58:26.04]Yeah, but I mean, won't they show up?
[58:29.30]The items should show up.
[58:37.54]Irma still hasn't hit puberty.
[58:38.59]Yeah, wouldn't the new items appear, like in the pool of items?
[58:42.81]Yeah, they would.
[58:54.67]Yeah.
[58:58.23]Not yet.
[59:02.77]Who are you talking to?
[59:05.95]That's my... Nice.
[59:08.47]That's my favorite comment of the day, for sure.
[59:10.32]Because if you really think about it, I am just speaking out loud in a room.
[59:18.38]I'm by myself in a room.
[59:22.24]I'm not physically talking to anybody.
[59:23.64]My voice is being transmitted through alien technology into your alien technology desktop.
[59:36.55]That's zoinked.
[59:37.41]You're zonked.
[59:40.88]That's a new enemy.
[59:42.74]That's not.
[59:51.49]I don't know.
[59:51.81]I'm of the opinion that the fact that your microwave works, we had to have been visited by aliens at some point.
[59:59.83]Right?
[60:00.09]The fact that this is like a box that like goes and your food is ready to eat in a minute.
[60:18.25]How did you even come up with that?
[60:19.63]Why would you even do that?
[60:20.97]Why would you even think to do that?
[60:24.83]Who fucking made the first microwave?
[60:27.77]It was like, you know what?
[60:28.45]Let's put radiation in a box in your house and turn it up to like a million.
[60:34.07]What?
[60:34.27]It was Dr. Wave.
[60:45.32]Just Google it.
[60:47.42]No, I don't want to do any research or Google anything.
[60:50.10]I want you to tell me what it was.
[60:53.12]I don't want to actually figure it out.
[60:54.52]I want you to tell me anything, and I'll just believe you.
[60:57.35]Come on.
[61:02.61]Like, typing in Google, like, who invented the microwave?
[61:05.55]It's like, Dr. D, micro, okay.
[61:09.45]Yeah, no, but, like, you told me.
[61:11.87]Just tell me it was aliens that gave the technology to us, and I don't care.
[61:16.42]That's it.
[61:16.78]That's what it is.
[61:19.15]Use incognito.
[61:23.29]Imagine how fucking paranoid of a person you would be to be like scared to Google who invented the microwave.
[61:31.10]Why would you need incognito for that?
[61:35.67]No, no, no.
[61:36.03]I can't have anybody to ever see this.
[61:37.59]Nobody in my house.
[61:38.23]Nobody.
[61:38.71]I can't have Google though.
[61:40.31]Who invented the microwave?
[61:41.31]No, no, no, no, no.
[61:42.39]Incognito for that one.
[61:48.87]Faded Polaroid, you feel faded.
[61:50.43]What's that?
[61:55.95]God damn it, stop calling me out.
[62:00.82]What does this do?
[62:03.42]I almost said faded microwave.
[62:05.22]Does a microwave get, like, diminishing returns over time?
[62:12.15]Or can it just generate radiation energy forever?
[62:15.19]Forever.
[62:18.47]Does it burn out?
[62:19.91]Does the thing burn out in the middle?
[62:25.22]What are you even saying anymore?
[62:26.14]I'm saying like when your microwave goes bad... Are you okay?
[62:44.18]Okay, I gotta stop like fucking being stupid.
[62:48.12]Oh, hey, when a microwave goes bad.
[62:52.04]Please, God, give me a conversation to hold while my brain is in a different location playing Binding of Isaac.
[62:57.20]Hey, do microwaves go bad?
[62:59.58]Almond milk.
[63:01.86]Damage down, tears up.
[63:02.92]You feel... Oh, Jesus.
[63:05.02]I shouldn't have picked this up.
[63:12.77]Wait, that's going to make way more fires, right?
[63:14.85]What's wrong with me?
[63:17.13]Why am I, why am I fading out for?
[63:18.59]What do all these things do?
[63:24.53]Why am I, I'm faded.
[63:27.69]You're faded.
[63:32.03]Alright, what's my damage?
[63:32.99]1.3, that's horrible.
[63:44.91]Alright, secret room is right here.
[63:46.81]Probably.
[63:47.90]Maybe.
[63:52.66]Fires are good.
[63:53.30]Yeah, the fires are going to be awesome.
[63:54.32]No, let's just kill the boss.
[63:55.96]Whatever.
[63:56.74]I got money though.
[63:57.34]Should I go in there?
[64:03.19]Faded.
[64:04.03]Yeah, I'll get the map.
[64:05.98]It's definitely worth it.
[64:06.67]I need to get more damage or this run is over.
[64:09.61]I need at least five to six damage or this run is over.
[64:13.69]Over.
[64:14.73]It's not coming back.
[64:15.65]Over.
[64:17.51]Ooh, secrets.
[64:22.98]Like the almond milk and like the soy milk, right?
[64:25.58]Whatever.
[64:25.96]The things that make you just shoot a million miles per hour, but your damage is terrible.
[64:31.71]I'm of the opinion that if you don't have at least five damage by floor five, just fucking uninstall and come back later.
[64:40.14]Right here, right?
[64:46.94]What is that?
[64:47.70]That's new.
[64:49.44]Oh, man.
[64:50.00]What is that?
[64:50.44]That's like mega dog food.
[64:52.75]That's a full dog meal.
[64:54.03]I need bombs.
[65:03.75]That's seriously omega dog food.
[65:05.97]Alright, I need bombs now.
[65:07.23]It's a dog feast.
[65:12.23]Bomb?
[65:13.67]Alright, I'm going for it.
[65:14.39]They're all concussed.
[65:26.42]Is that what the faded lemon does?
[65:31.33]Actually, never mind.
[65:31.93]With the fire, this might be fine.
[65:32.99]I just need more luck.
[65:36.89]Holy shit, that's actually awesome.
[65:40.46]That fire rate is amazing.
[65:44.20]Bomb.
[65:45.24]Come on.
[65:48.28]Shot speed up.
[65:48.96]I'll take it.
[65:51.12]And that's Guppy's Caller.
[65:52.98]Eternal Life.
[65:53.64]Imagine getting Guppy with this.
[65:58.40]Faded Brain.
[65:59.02]I need a bomb for this damn thing.
[66:03.90]Microwave fact incoming.
[66:07.91]Microwave fact incoming.
[66:11.56]I think it was deleted.
[66:14.71]Yeah, I think you guys, that's like spam.
[66:16.93]In 1945, the heating effect of a high-power microwave beam was accidentally discovered by Percy Spencer, an American self-taught engineer from Howland, Maine.
[66:23.97]Employed by Raytheon at the time, he noticed that microwaves from an active radar set he was working on started to melt a chocolate bar he had in his pocket.
[66:33.32]The first food deliberately cooked with Spencer's microwave was popcorn, and the second was an egg, which exploded in the face.
[66:42.80]It exploded in his face?
[66:46.47]Was there no cover on the microwave?
[66:49.69]Wait, did he not... Was it like a microwave convertible?
[66:51.89]He just could look down and just blow up in his face?
[66:55.43]I can't get... Is it with the bombs in the shop?
[66:59.56]No.
[67:00.84]That sucks, but whatever.
[67:02.20]Let's go.
[67:04.58]I can't get that thing.
[67:05.68]That mega dog meal.
[67:08.84]I want it so bad.
[67:09.94]Alright, pestilence.
[67:15.30]Let's go.
[67:21.56]Am I negating his shots with this?
[67:26.58]Okay, I was completely wrong.
[67:27.66]This is really good.
[67:32.00]Uh, bandage.
[67:33.30]No bombs though.
[67:35.40]That sucks, whatever it is.
[67:37.07]Can't get it.
[67:40.29]You just mulched that guy.
[67:41.61]That's a really, that's a great term.
[67:46.01]I mulched him.
[67:48.61]Alright, whatever.
[67:52.29]Shop?
[67:53.37]There's no bomb in the shop.
[67:58.34]I was just in there.
[67:58.80]Just give me more damage.
[68:06.74]I don't care about anything else.
[68:07.52]Just damage up.
[68:09.08]Damage up and shop.
[68:10.32]Of course, I get two.
[68:12.64]Damage up and tier size up.
[68:21.87]I missed the bomb?
[68:22.59]I don't think I did.
[68:23.22]What are these?
[68:25.92]This is new.
[68:28.56]Spiked rocks?
[68:29.34]What does that mean?
[68:33.20]I'm not wasting the bomb.
[68:38.34]What was that?
[68:47.15]Come on, open.
[68:48.21]Open, open, open.
[68:51.58]Oh, I had a Blackheart, right?
[68:57.21]Oh, come on.
[69:03.07]Infamy.
[69:03.69]Blocks damage sometimes.
[69:05.21]Ooh, this is really good.
[69:06.89]As long as I'm facing the right direction.
[69:21.46]I like the Isaac music when it goes... Stop pretending.
[69:41.26]You know, you could probably, like, program a chat bot to write stop pretending at intervals of, like, eight minutes.
[69:49.16]And, like, a streamer, like, I would just look over and see it and be like, oh, what the fuck?
[69:53.07]I'm not.
[69:57.17]That's the guaranteed way to make any streamer be, like, annoyed for a second.
[70:01.66]Guaranteed.
[70:02.02]Even if it's, you just, even if you're making it up, you're just saying it for fun, it doesn't matter.
[70:11.83]This guy's different.
[70:14.71]Is this the same, uh, coin, uh, what's it?
[70:18.01]Coin bum?
[70:19.09]What is he?
[70:19.73]Is this new?
[70:27.72]What'd he do?
[70:33.32]Charge?
[70:33.92]He's a charge bum?
[70:38.99]I thought it was I thought it was coin see for coin well what I don't okay There's more to look at hold on Microwave Right
[71:12.60]And they're putting utensils in the microwave!
[71:14.48]You can't do that!
[71:22.59]Why are you doing that?
[71:24.53]I don't know.
[71:31.73]I don't think... Did anybody get that?
[71:37.69]Alright, last one.
[71:38.48]What are you talking about?
[71:42.70]Nobody?
[71:43.02]Oh, wow.
[71:43.28]Alright.
[71:43.62]What the fuck are you saying?
[71:47.40]I don't know.
[71:48.26]That was a scene from Gremlins 2.
[71:50.55]I like that movie.
[71:51.31]Alright, should I take the umbilical cord or the thing?
[72:04.70]This faded picture.
[72:09.30]I have no idea what the faded picture really even does.
[72:12.44]Just hit them with the... What?
[72:15.64]The... Faded.
[72:19.84]Alright, give me something good.
[72:22.50]That's good.
[72:23.32]One shot.
[72:24.10]Got it.
[72:24.90]Yup.
[72:26.64]Fly, love.
[72:27.40]Hooray.
[72:27.78]Alright.
[72:29.32]That's a lot of money.
[72:34.16]Hey, Baldi.
[72:34.90]See, that was a lot of message for something I'm not going to read.
[72:37.30]So, whatever.
[72:46.11]Ooh.
[72:47.73]I need bombs.
[72:48.55]Wait, no I don't.
[72:53.39]Who has these bombs and you can fly?
[73:01.63]Sorry.
[73:04.57]You just, you just like picked me up from my armpits.
[73:08.29]Like me dead weighting you, you just lifted me up by the armpits.
[73:20.64]Leave me alone!
[73:21.20]Get away from me!
[73:22.26]Get away from me!
[73:22.90]Get away from me!
[73:23.39]Get away from me!
[73:27.37]What the fuck does that picture do?
[73:34.37]That was Quagmire?
[73:46.61]I can't even replicate it.
[73:49.23]I can't replicate it.
[73:49.97]I don't even know what it was.
[73:51.87]Um, I don't want to take a guess.
[73:53.11]Why would I do that?
[73:59.49]Hi, Jerma.
[74:00.11]Hold on.
[74:01.05]This looks like it's an important message.
[74:03.99]Hi, Jerma.
[74:04.95]New items will show up in stuff, but to unlock the new alternative path and endings, you need to beat Hush three times.
[74:13.02]Okay, if you've already gotten a lot of Afterbirth Plus unlocks, you might not feel too bad just downloading a complete AB Plus save and starting Repentance from there.
[74:20.70]Okay.
[74:23.54]Um, I think I've beaten Hush at least once or twice on here.
[74:35.53]Download a save.
[74:37.61]That always feels so icky to me, though.
[74:39.25]Like, I want to do it.
[74:44.02]Alright, I had to do it.
[74:49.24]Is it to beat Hush three times?
[74:50.48]Yeah, Hush is obnoxious.
[74:53.38]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[75:02.52]Use cheat engine?
[75:04.20]Um, ah!
[75:07.78]Maybe I'll get a save file.
[75:17.32]Watch out.
[75:21.28]When is this coming to Switch, too?
[75:22.40]I like playing this in bed.
[75:23.22]I think that's everything, right?
[75:26.10]Yeah, that's everything.
[75:31.88]Literally never.
[75:32.84]Are you serious?
[75:39.23]What do you mean literally never?
[75:40.29]I'm hurting my head seeing that many things happen.
[75:54.84]Bombs, pearls, range, and luck up.
[75:56.45]I'll take the luck for the fire.
[75:57.57]That's awesome.
[75:58.09]Alright, what do you got?
[76:01.79]I'm not doing this.
[76:06.59]Using Wii Shark to beat this game?
[76:08.10]Take them.
[76:10.12]Do it.
[76:10.36]No.
[76:10.88]Oh, fuck.
[76:29.50]Get out of here.
[76:31.06]Get out of here.
[76:34.52]Those are the worst rooms in the whole game.
[76:36.00]These guys jump.
[76:42.00]I don't like it.
[76:42.58]Good.
[76:49.17]Stop pretending.
[76:50.15]Pretending to be good.
[76:54.39]See, that context can mean anything.
[76:59.96]It could be what I'm saying.
[77:02.30]Stop pretending to not know what that is.
[77:04.08]Stop pretending to be good.
[77:05.16]We all know you're bad.
[77:06.45]Stop pretending to be bad for views.
[77:16.33]That's another one too.
[77:17.63]How is he so bad?
[77:19.01]Oh, that one drives me nuts.
[77:21.61]I hate that one.
[77:25.03]I guess I could get some bombs.
[77:29.02]Oh no, you don't get bombs, you give him bombs.
[77:32.48]Well now you have to die.
[77:33.58]Oh fuck.
[77:49.80]I'm not... okay.
[77:52.50]Give him more bombs.
[77:53.36]I only have four, I need them for secret rooms.
[78:01.43]How is he pretending this much?
[78:05.03]Well, I do.
[78:07.26]I hope everyone's doing well.
[78:08.80]It's been a while since you've seen me.
[78:10.84]Those of you that may have trickled in before, we'll go.
[78:12.74]We're going to go over some stuff here.
[78:14.38]We'll go over just quickly because there are a lot of people here.
[78:17.58]So we got to reiterate some things.
[78:21.39]First and foremost, the medical stuff is progressing.
[78:26.23]I'm doing a lot of shit for it.
[78:27.99]I'm doing some treatments.
[78:29.37]I had a bunch of injections into my back.
[78:32.67]And I want these coins.
[78:36.64]Uh, the ejections went into the muscle tissue around my, like, spine and back area.
[78:40.59]As a start, I might, oh, god damn it.
[78:44.96]I might do, uh, I might do more of them.
[78:48.24]But the TL;DR of this whole thing is I'm probably going to start doing more serious therapy work, like body work, physical therapy, strength training back there.
[79:01.13]We're going to try to see if we can get that area to not be as fucked up as it is for some reason, which people still don't know why.
[79:06.21]That's the most frustrating part.
[79:09.70]People still don't know exactly why this is happening.
[79:12.68]I've heard you have costochondritis.
[79:14.38]Okay.
[79:15.30]What the fuck does that mean?
[79:16.34]That means you have your chest and your back rib cage hurts.
[79:20.36]Why?
[79:21.08]I don't know.
[79:23.21]Okay.
[79:23.91]So now what?
[79:24.71]Well, you can get a shot.
[79:27.93]Okay.
[79:28.37]Is that what I do?
[79:29.53]Well, you know, it might not even be costochondritis.
[79:31.69]It could be the dehydrated discs you have in your spine.
[79:35.78]Okay.
[79:37.26]What do I do about that?
[79:38.38]Oh, nothing.
[79:39.70]What do you mean you don't do anything?
[79:41.12]Well, maybe we could do like some trigger point therapy.
[79:43.20]Okay.
[79:45.75]You know, it also could be the hernia.
[79:47.27]You have a little hiatal hernia.
[79:49.27]What do I do about that?
[79:50.13]Well, nothing.
[79:50.65]Just like eat different.
[79:52.53]Just change your diet so you don't get like GERD.
[79:54.39]It's like acid reflux.
[79:57.61]Okay.
[79:59.05]So, now what?
[80:01.75]I'm not going to pick this up yet.
[80:06.09]So nobody, there's been a couple of theories.
[80:08.37]Oh, you might have like myofascial pain syndrome.
[80:12.05]Okay.
[80:13.37]What does that mean?
[80:14.46]Well, it hurts.
[80:16.14]Why?
[80:16.36]I don't know.
[80:19.44]What?
[80:19.64]I know yet.
[80:30.39]Uh, but it's not bad enough where it's, it, look, I, I, it's not gonna, I can walk fine, I can sit, I can, I'm sitting here right now, right?
[80:40.03]But, it just, it's just kind of a problem constantly.
[80:43.75]And it's something that I always kind of have to sit in the back of my mind, no matter what, no matter what I'm doing.
[80:49.58]And those of you that are in this chat that might have one of these medical problems that isn't enough to really debilitate you that much, but it's enough to constantly be a problem, and you don't really have an answer for it, I feel you here.
[81:04.83]I do, because it sucks.
[81:07.75]Is this new?
[81:08.17]What is this?
[81:09.49]Can it be a tinted ground?
[81:12.63]That's a tinted ground.
[81:14.97]What?
[81:15.87]That's like a ground.
[81:16.89]That means there's something in the ground.
[81:22.35]Right?
[81:24.92]Look at that.
[81:25.44]That's the exact thing that's on the tinted rocks.
[81:28.37]Can I get a shovel or something?
[81:38.09]So, I just want to make sure everyone's not overly concerned about it.
[81:43.39]Or that, oh my god, what's wrong?
[81:44.79]Are you alright?
[81:46.43]I'm fine.
[81:46.97]I am.
[81:47.73]It's just a constant 3 or 4 out of 10 in the pain scale.
[81:52.44]All day.
[81:53.48]Every day.
[81:54.30]And it doesn't stop.
[81:55.24]And it hasn't stopped in almost 3 years.
[81:58.12]So...
[82:00.50]I have to start to go down some kind of path to figure out why the fuck this is happening.
[82:07.64]And even when I've tried to, it's become difficult.
[82:17.71]Ooh, more luck.
[82:18.55]Perfect.
[82:21.68]As somebody that has had, uh... chronic pain their whole life was constantly told we don't know LOL by doctors, I feel your pain on a literal level.
[82:24.26]Yeah that's- that's- that- that sucks. It really does.
[82:31.00]Because I was really thinking that - this is like two three years ago, I was like: Oh, man. My like- my like chest hurts and my back hurts. Oh that's- that's probably nothing, whatever.
[82:41.00]When it- when it- when it stuck around for like two three weeks I went to the doctor and I was like: Oh, I mean they'll- they'll do like a- like a CT scan of my back and they'll be: Oh, you have like uh this and it's like: Oh, okay, whatever. Fix it.
[82:52.60]At- when you- when you kind of figure out that that's not happening it's like: Oh no, we don't really know why.
[82:59.60]And even the things that I've told them, um... for instance some of the things that maybe things that may have happened to me uh over the last three or four years. Medically speaking, uh mechanically speaking.
[82:11.60]How do you sit? How do you do this? What do you- I've always kind of been told that... well that might not be why you're having it, it could be something else.
[83:21.07]So... Ooh, do I take that?
[83:27.32]I breakdanced on the internet.
[83:30.32]Yeah, better pills are just better.
[83:31.38]How is puberty better?
[83:35.74]What is adult?
[83:36.30]Oh, I took puberty three times.
[83:48.06]Oh man, Chronic Pain might, yeah.
[83:49.46]Yeah, it's... Having no answer for why this is happening.
[83:55.77]Makes you like second guess everything you ever hear too.
[83:59.03]And there's a lot of times that you sit there and you go, is this like, am I making this shit up?
[84:03.28]Am I just making this up somehow?
[84:04.88]And then you like get in your own head.
[84:07.06]You like freak yourself out.
[84:07.98]You're like, no, why would I do that?
[84:09.18]That's not, that's no.
[84:11.88]Like very clearly, like it hurts.
[84:13.12]Like if I, if I, no, it's painful.
[84:16.44]Um, you kind of like get in your own head.
[84:24.50]But it did, it just, it kind of came out of... It slowly, over about a week or two, got to the point that it is now.
[84:31.77]And it's never really gotten any worse.
[84:34.29]But it's never gotten better.
[84:35.54]That's the weirdest part.
[84:36.44]Because typically, if you have some potential pain problems, right, they either get better or they don't, and make it worse.
[84:44.49]It's like, do I have a small hernia?
[84:46.33]Is the hernia just constantly putting pressure on, like, my, uh, the middle chest bone area?
[84:51.21]That's what they thought.
[84:51.87]Maybe, like, maybe my, they call it a xiphoid process.
[84:54.49]It was like, maybe your xiphoid process, it's this little thing that's just in the center of your chest.
[84:58.67]Maybe that's what's happened.
[84:59.67]What happened to it?
[85:00.31]Uh, I've done everything.
[85:03.69]Let's go.
[85:03.93]Go to a chiropractor?
[85:06.65]I have.
[85:08.04]I have gone to a chiropractor many times.
[85:10.96]And it doesn't seem to fix anything.
[85:16.75]the sternum yeah I I have radiating pain that goes from the middle of my back through the center of my chest all day every day it has not stopped in three years and at this point it's kind of like it's time to manage it rather than well I have to figure out what it is I'm in like the try to manage it stage
[85:44.48]I have, as you guys know, I have been to so many doctors about this.
[85:51.87]And it's time just to try to manage it.
[85:54.33]Just manage it.
[85:57.17]Medical physical therapy.
[85:59.33]Trigger point injections.
[86:01.37]Uh, maybe some, uh, maybe like an intercostal nerve block, which is another thing to potentially do.
[86:07.74]Where they actually go in and they fuck with the nerve in your, like, intercostal chest and back region.
[86:11.42]I don't know.
[86:16.48]Get a Tony Stark heart.
[86:19.18]Oh, the white heart.
[86:21.36]The eternal heart.
[86:22.19]I just started talking.
[86:22.99]Ah, shit.
[86:24.21]It's okay.
[86:24.49]I don't even need it.
[86:25.07]It's a crutch.
[86:25.85]I need to spend my money somewhere.
[86:35.88]I have a lot of money.
[86:38.50]I'm so mad.
[86:42.70]I mean, there's also the theory too, and I have to be honest, right?
[86:45.78]I can't just pretend like I don't have a pretty sedentary lifestyle.
[86:51.27]I try to move around, but the worst part about it is when I do move around, it hurts.
[86:57.83]If I do any type of real like kind of physical exercise or physical, anything involving my core, oh, I feel like shit for a week.
[87:07.64]It's like, what's going on there?
[87:11.62]So that makes it even harder.
[87:12.74]It's like, oh, maybe I need to, like, really work that area out and, like, strengthen it.
[87:18.58]But when I do that, it's like, holy shit, I can't even move for, like, fucking four days.
[87:30.31]You think it was when somebody in chat cursed you?
[87:32.87]Oh, yeah, I thought about that, too.
[87:35.03]I thought about that, too.
[87:37.97]Yeah, I don't know.
[87:39.97]I'm sitting there thinking like, holy shit, did I piss off some type of warlock that was watching the stream and he heard me say that Pikmin 2 sucked or something?
[87:48.78]And he's like, just put a warlock curse on me?
[87:56.13]He's sitting there like in a bubbling cauldron.
[87:58.91]He's got my stream open.
[87:59.87]He was like a fan or something.
[88:01.97]He was an old fan.
[88:07.22]He saw where I put In-and-out on the tier list and he threw like fucking frog's legs and like bat wings into a fucking cauldron... and just cursed the shit out of me.
[88:18.89]I don't know.
[88:19.27]It's possible.
[88:31.62]Anything is possible at this point.
[88:33.00]Dude they- okay, I have to tell you a real story.
[88:38.00]This is like- ugh. This story is so... oh... I'm gonna tell it because whatever I don't even care.
[88:43.00]It's like- it's- it's, the story sucks because I really thought like I don't know.
[88:49.00]My brain started going: Oh my god! Wait a minute, is this real?
[88:53.00]So on Christmas Eve of last- two years ago I think it was. I- I woke up...
[89:02.81]And I woke up and my back didn't really hurt that much.
[89:06.90]I felt okay.
[89:08.08]It was like, I feel like I don't feel horrible right now.
[89:11.34]Is it gone?
[89:11.90]And I looked at the clock and it was like 12.01 Christmas Day.
[89:17.01]And I was like, wait a minute.
[89:20.03]Jesus?
[89:20.45]Jesus?
[89:21.97]God?
[89:25.86]Christmas miracle?
[89:27.36]No way.
[89:28.68]And I was like, I feel okay.
[89:29.94]I feel like a little better.
[89:30.81]And I like really thought that like Jesus like fucking blessed me.
[89:35.69]Like 10 minutes.
[89:42.93]And then I was like, oh, wait a minute.
[89:44.93]And I got in the shower or something and I ended up being like, oh, no, no, it hurts.
[89:49.91]No, it must have been the way that I like stood up or something.
[89:53.99]And it was, I was so sad.
[89:59.42]And I remember... I'm not even kidding.
[90:01.54]This is not a lie.
[90:03.18]I remember sitting there and going like, hey, I mean, if that was you, like, if that's a real thing, like, you know, I'll be at church every fucking Sunday.
[90:10.22]I'll be at church every week and I swear to God.
[90:12.91]I swear to you.
[90:20.29]Jesus 10 minute savior.
[90:22.29]And then they came back and
[90:30.12]Here we are.
[90:32.43]It was Jesus who cursed you.
[90:34.47]No, it wasn't.
[90:35.83]Secondhand?
[90:39.97]What's secondhand?
[90:43.63]It was a free trial Jesus blessing.
[90:48.39]Oh, shit.
[90:49.09]So that was like his free trial subscription and I had to go to church to get the rest of it.
[90:53.71]You're right.
[90:54.17]Oh.
[91:05.95]Jesus Pro.
[91:07.09]A Jesus Pro subscription.
[91:10.99]God damn it.
[91:12.19]No, stop saying that.
[91:13.39]God, no.
[91:14.09]Stop saying God after that.
[91:16.68]I'm sorry.
[91:17.44]I'm sorry.
[91:17.94]I didn't... Listen to me.
[91:20.18]I gotta get that out of my vocabulary.
[91:21.50]I gotta stop saying that.
[91:24.16]Is this worth taking over the beta dome?
[91:28.78]What's better?
[91:29.14]What's this even do?
[91:31.12]Extended stat effect time?
[91:33.00]Let's go look around.
[91:34.76]Or the shiny rock.
[91:37.23]Doesn't this make, um... I guess I could have... Shiny rock makes it so you find coins in rocks, right?
[91:52.55]That's not what it is.
[91:57.59]Oh, it makes the, uh, it makes the tinted rocks blink.
[92:01.27]Right, okay.
[92:03.00]What does the second hand do?
[92:10.06]I need more health, because this build is actually really good.
[92:13.30]That's a lot of luck, a ton of fire.
[92:14.76]I need more damage, and I need more HP.
[92:16.72]I need, like, the meat bone thing.
[92:20.60]Christian streamer arc.
[92:29.03]You know how many times I've, like, sat there and been like... How do I... What should I do?
[92:33.57]Should I do something about this?
[92:35.91]Should I, like... Maybe I should go to church for a while and just see what happens, right?
[92:41.45]What's the worst that could happen?
[92:43.05]I go to church for a few months?
[92:44.95]Every Sunday?
[92:45.51]And, like, go there and actually really participate?
[92:48.57]What if it goes away?
[92:50.01]What if it went away?
[92:52.97]Right?
[92:53.25]Like...
[92:55.98]Imagine going to church and, like, talking to the priest or whatever.
[92:59.64]The priest is like, oh, so I haven't seen you at this church before.
[93:04.06]What do you do?
[93:04.98]Is there a reason why I haven't seen you?
[93:06.46]How long have you been here for?
[93:07.32]And I'm like, I'm just doing, like, a trial to see if, like, God will cure my back.
[93:11.61]And then I'm done.
[93:14.01]Oh.
[93:17.13]Um, that's... He probably, like, started throwing holy water at me.
[93:24.71]Like, that's, like, demonic.
[93:28.77]Yeah, I kind of just want, like, God to fix my back, and then I'm just gonna go back to my normal life.
[93:36.38]You guys serve alcohol here?
[93:39.14]Pheromones.
[93:41.16]Ooh, keep them.
[93:42.00]Come on.
[93:49.51]Oh, this thing sucks.
[93:59.82]Wine.
[94:00.42]Yeah, but I'm talking about... Whatever.
[94:07.65]This thing opens up locked chests, right?
[94:10.87]Eh.
[94:14.90]Secondhand extended stat effect time.
[94:16.50]I feel like that's probably really good.
[94:25.87]Oh.
[94:28.43]God, I'm getting a shitload of subs right now.
[94:30.61]That was 69 from Zap.
[94:33.07]It was also 50 from somebody earlier and I was in the middle of talking about like microwaving something, right?
[94:37.69]People are giving a shit.
[94:39.52]Thank you guys.
[94:39.96]Seriously.
[94:45.54]Funny number.
[94:46.78]It is a funny number.
[94:52.24]Tear blast and five bombs.
[94:53.84]I need the bombs.
[94:54.58]Thank you.
[95:00.01]Thanks for the 69 sub.
[95:00.65]Look at all these fires coming up.
[95:05.15]More luck.
[95:07.03]And more money to spend.
[95:09.03]School bag has appeared in the basement.
[95:10.51]Didn't have that already.
[95:17.82]What is that?
[95:21.76]I hate getting greed in the shop rooms.
[95:23.34]It's the most annoying thing in the world.
[95:27.30]Any tears?
[95:31.26]Wait, what?
[95:33.26]Well, these are now pennies.
[95:35.32]Whoa!
[95:43.89]And I'm shooting so many of these, it's gonna proc all the time.
[95:46.71]I think the tears now make them drop coins, right?
[95:51.29]I wish I could spend them somewhere.
[95:55.18]I'm gonna pray to the Egyptian god, whatever, to heal your ribcage.
[96:07.37]Well, but don't do that.
[96:08.33]Okay, but hold on a minute, but don't do that either though, because they come with like consequences.
[96:14.73]I don't know.
[96:15.05]I feel like, oh, I guess I'm going to have to pray to like some old God from the sixth million BC.
[96:23.46]I don't know.
[96:23.72]Don't you feel like that person's going to want like five of my fingers or something?
[96:27.82]Yes, Mr. Elbertson.
[96:29.48]I will absolutely cure you, but you're going to lose five of your fingers.
[96:34.31]No.
[96:40.90]I think that's all I need to do.
[96:41.92]Yeah, let's go.
[96:43.54]Come on, mom.
[96:51.36]Coins everywhere.
[96:52.14]Spam, spam, spam, spam.
[96:59.38]I need more damage.
[97:00.02]I'm not doing enough.
[97:00.52]How are you going to get through the womb with this kind of shit damage?
[97:03.82]I don't know.
[97:04.20]You're not going to.
[97:10.15]Yeah, this is shit damage.
[97:11.09]It's shit.
[97:18.22]I don't even have the negative.
[97:21.80]I need a save file.
[97:24.73]If you had to lose five fingers, which ones would you choose?
[97:29.31]Let's see.
[97:33.05]Middle finger?
[97:35.02]Middle finger and ring finger on both sides.
[97:37.48]No.
[97:38.26]Middle finger on both sides.
[97:40.26]No.
[97:40.62]Just one whole hand.
[97:41.30]Probably.
[97:44.12]Because that... No.
[97:48.62]I think I'd want it to be one hand.
[97:52.49]Yeah, because otherwise it would be difficult.
[97:55.51]Because five is a lot.
[97:56.37]That's a lot.
[98:01.11]That guppy's tail...
[98:04.13]I have a guppy something, right?
[98:12.18]I need one more guppy item.
[98:13.26]I only have two hearts.
[98:14.44]This is awful.
[98:23.08]I'm not going to pick up the robes.
[98:24.16]It'll kill me.
[98:42.79]How can I get through the room with such shit damage?
[98:44.65]Out of context sounds awful.
[98:45.82]I mean... There's only one context that would make any sense and it's in this game.
[98:50.22]Damn it.
[98:52.28]I'm gonna die.
[98:54.70]I'm dead!
[98:55.30]No, I'm not.
[98:55.60]I got a life.
[98:55.96]It's just shit damage is what it is.
[99:17.57]Oh, these are new.
[99:18.01]I don't know what these guys do.
[99:20.88]What are they doing?
[99:22.26]What are they doing?
[99:22.86]I don't know what this is.
[99:25.22]What was that?
[99:29.26]They spit out?
[99:30.12]Okay.
[99:36.67]Just restart?
[99:37.43]I have to get over there.
[99:54.27]That's what those do.
[99:54.81]Give me HP.
[100:02.44]I'll take it.
[100:02.82]Better than nothing.
[100:04.70]I hate those things to the worst.
[100:16.97]Don't move.
[100:24.79]Be careful what you say on stream.
[100:25.99]Jesus is listening.
[100:32.95]Santa?
[100:47.25]he sees you when you're sleeping he knows when you're awake he knows you've been bad or good so be good for goodness sake yeah like Jesus doesn't like see you when you're sleeping and stuff like this Jesus doesn't know when you're asleep or not right Santa's like has more power is Santa more powerful than like never mind
[101:20.48]He is.
[101:25.84]That's blasphemy.
[101:27.06]I'm not... Look, I'm not... I'm gonna go... Look, I... Okay, well, look.
[101:37.40]I've... Listen to some of the shit I've said on this stream.
[101:40.86]I've said some pretty blasphemous shit on here.
[101:50.77]I thought Santa was Jesus.
[101:58.09]What is that thing?
[101:58.97]You leave cookies out and carrots for like Jesus.
[102:14.78]No, I hate fighting greed.
[102:16.58]I want stuff.
[102:25.04]oh my god I can't even whatever 99 coins cool what do you mean carrots yeah people saying why people saying carrots in question mark you leave the carrots out for the reindeer you guys kidding me
[102:54.31]Hold on.
[102:54.99]I'm dead.
[102:57.33]Okay.
[102:57.83]You guys have to be so shocked right now.
[103:00.11]I'm so shocked that people are question marking me saying the carrots are for the reindeer that I just can't even pay attention to the game.
[103:11.40]That was a shit build anyways.
[103:15.94]Intensifying tears.
[103:17.00]What's that mean?
[103:23.07]It's sugar cubes?
[103:24.65]No, what are you making a latte for the reindeer?
[103:26.86]No, you leave cookies and carrots.
[103:31.24]Cookies are for Santa.
[103:32.76]The carrots are for the reindeer.
[103:37.78]Yeah, milk.
[103:39.77]Yeah, you leave milk.
[103:43.11]That's a ton of bombs.
[103:44.03]Oh my god.
[103:45.91]You leave milk?
[103:46.33]Milk?
[103:48.39]A carrot, or one or two carrots... and one cookie.
[103:52.39]And when you wake up in the morning you see that there's a big bite out of the fucking carrot and a big bite out of the cookie and the milk is half gone.
[104:05.39]Can you imagine needing to like- how horrible that would be? To just take a one bite out of like 500 million cookies. That would suck!
[104:16.72]At some point, you just break them in half and throw the other half away.
[104:23.01]After the third house, Santa's not eating the cookies anymore.
[104:26.63]He's just literally biting them and spitting them in your trash.
[104:29.87]Go look.
[104:34.65]If you're on the Pacific time zone, the next morning, go look in your trash and see if there's a crumpled up spit cookie in there.
[104:42.34]Tears of...
[104:56.47]I have to beat the hush once.
[104:57.71]Come on.
[105:02.34]I'm so sad I didn't get any new items there.
[105:08.20]500 million global population.
[105:10.86]Well, no, I was just saying like in like how many people does Santa visit in a night?
[105:17.56]A billion?
[105:18.16]Two billion?
[105:20.54]600 million?
[105:20.88]500?
[105:21.56]How many like realistic houses would Santa go to?
[105:25.25]Because there are a lot of people that don't celebrate like Christmas night, right?
[105:30.20]It's not everybody celebrates Christmas.
[105:32.48]How many people are on Earth?
[105:33.64]How many people are in... He stuffs his cookies in his closet like a squirrel and he has food forever.
[105:48.41]Well, then why would he take one bite out of them?
[105:50.99]No, he's taking a bite and mushing it up and spitting it into your fucking like bathroom trash.
[105:55.27]Because by the way, Santa's taking a shit in one of your houses.
[106:00.07]I don't... You're gonna wake up at some point, you're gonna walk around and like your house is gonna stink like a huge dump.
[106:11.88]You're not just waking up in the morning and going to the bathroom and the seat is down and just like this like dehydrated yellow piss is sprayed all over the toilet.
[106:21.03]You're like, who did that?
[106:23.77]He's, I mean, this guy's in a rush.
[106:26.15]He's gonna just burst into your bathroom, pull his fucking pants down and just piss.
[106:30.46]Oh!
[106:31.68]Oh!
[106:32.46]Shit!
[106:35.52]What is that thing?
[106:37.28]He's gotta go!
[106:37.86]This is a new item?
[106:45.70]I think I'm gonna, it's like a top hat?
[106:46.74]What is that?
[106:47.86]I'm gonna take it.
[106:49.57]Battery pack.
[106:50.33]Instant energy.
[106:51.03]That's all that was.
[106:55.29]That was 15 coins.
[106:58.86]Now I'm going to rage buy this.
[107:00.00]I thought it was a top hat.
[107:10.38]There are multiple Santas.
[107:14.07]It doesn't matter how many Santas there are in the sky at any given time.
[107:18.11]One of you guys on Earth is going to wake up with a really, really, like, just destroyed, detonated bathroom.
[107:25.78]And one of those reindeers are going to take a shit on your house.
[107:37.06]You're going to be able to look at like Google Earth satellite images and just see whose houses have like huge reindeer dumps on them.
[107:44.84]I feel like that would be something you wouldn't want to clean up though.
[107:53.87]Wouldn't you want to leave it there?
[107:56.39]Would that increase the value of your house if it was confirmed that you had like a reindeer dump on your roof?
[108:05.58]That means that, like, I don't know, like, your house was, like, blessed by one of the... Fucking dead.
[108:12.37]Goddamn, I gotta pay attention.
[108:13.89]Alright, pay attention!
[108:20.77]Dead tooth, toxic breath.
[108:23.77]This is cool.
[108:25.95]Two keys, that door is different.
[108:27.37]Nothing.
[108:33.58]Alright, I'm gonna beat at least the game once here.
[108:43.32]That's pretty useful.
[108:47.70]Rusty Key, what does that mean?
[108:48.74]Don't you know that you're toxic?
[109:00.57]Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[109:08.25]Okay, if you left money out on the table where Santa was going... Oh, I'm gonna go eat the carrots and... Are you supposed to tip Santa?
[109:18.08]What if this whole time we've always been supposed to be leaving, like, $20 bills there?
[109:21.00]And he just, like, fucking hates us.
[109:26.69]Would the money still be there?
[109:27.79]Like, would he take it?
[109:29.09]If you left, like, $20 on the table with the milk?
[109:31.11]I don't think he'd leave it.
[109:46.69]We buy all his shit anyways.
[109:52.39]I thought you said your audience was 18 to 24 years old.
[110:08.62]Don't blame the chat.
[110:12.06]I'm not blaming anybody.
[110:12.90]I'm just asking a few questions.
[110:15.96]If
[110:18.94]You left a $50 bill on the table.
[110:21.42]Would Santa feel like he should take it?
[110:30.53]The devil.
[110:33.77]Santa doesn't need tips.
[110:34.91]He's got that juggles the great money.
[110:40.11]I mean... God damn it.
[110:43.03]I thought the other one was going to kill him.
[110:44.39]I thought the other tick was going to kill him.
[110:59.54]You ever also notice how every toy that's made in Santa's workshop and every piece of media is made out of wood?
[111:05.36]Why do they still do that?
[111:07.94]People get iPhones for Christmas, not like wooden horse.
[111:11.98]Why they're not making iPhones in those pieces of media?
[111:25.22]I'm not picking that up again.
[111:29.89]That's a robot chicken joke.
[111:34.68]It probably is.
[111:44.48]Reddit joke.
[111:47.01]When I was little, my parents left out a joint when Santa woke up and there was a roach there.
[111:55.73]What does four do?
[111:56.65]I don't know.
[112:05.20]Oh, that's like touching, that's like getting me.
[112:11.68]What does it do?
[112:12.26]What does a four dice room do?
[112:14.54]Rerolls all pedestals.
[112:16.90]Oh, I don't even have any pedestals?
[112:22.43]I guess the boss.
[112:25.15]Oh, shit.
[112:25.71]I could have just, whatever.
[112:31.39]There's a roach.
[112:34.33]And I am seeing and envisioning in my head right now.
[112:37.83]Just like the end of that roach.
[112:40.48]It's tiny.
[112:42.24]It's tiny.
[112:42.86]It just looks like you squished it down.
[112:44.48]It's all black on the edge.
[112:47.66]It's rancid looking.
[112:49.02]I have to get that.
[113:02.57]I need bombs.
[113:05.71]This is the Omega room, right?
[113:14.13]These are the ones that explode.
[113:15.13]I remember.
[113:15.61]It gets you off guard a lot.
[113:20.94]Hey, unionize your workplace.
[113:22.46]Thanks for the 50 community subs.
[113:24.62]Thanks a lot.
[113:27.18]These are the 50 community subs.
[113:33.91]I don't think I can get that key unless I have a bomb.
[113:37.23]Sorry, guys.
[113:38.31]It ain't happening.
[113:39.47]Wait.
[113:41.07]No, it ain't happening.
[113:46.94]Cane versus Baby Plum.
[113:48.56]Hurt him.
[113:50.50]This guy actually sucks.
[113:57.08]Yeah, I hate this guy.
[114:00.46]His moveset is very difficult to patternize it out.
[114:05.98]Damage and range up.
[114:06.94]Nice.
[114:07.24]Alright.
[114:07.72]That's good so far.
[114:11.63]He hates him.
[114:15.31]This... Doesn't it... Don't you feel like this floor should be way bigger?
[114:18.61]I thought the XL floors were huge.
[114:22.48]Huh.
[114:26.20]And the easiest boss in the game.
[114:28.36]Should be very simple.
[114:30.92]So easy.
[114:39.84]This is new.
[114:41.04]Booster pack.
[114:41.84]Collect them all.
[114:42.81]Whoa.
[114:44.75]Cool.
[114:45.23]I think that's new.
[114:47.67]Empress.
[114:48.92]Diamonds.
[114:51.30]Stars.
[114:53.68]Death.
[114:55.34]Oh, dude, Grotto Beasts.
[114:58.68]And by the way, for those of you that were not here earlier as well, we'll talk about this one more time.
[115:02.92]Grotto Beasts is real.
[115:04.72]It's going to be a real collectible trading card game that you will be able to buy physical, not digital, physical packs that you will be able to purchase with a ton more characters, a ton more stuff.
[115:18.67]That's going to be available at some point soon.
[115:21.87]That's a real thing now.
[115:24.29]Roto Beasts will be a real product for you to buy.
[115:28.19]I'm going to just use... I mean, all these are kind of... Is this the item, the shop room, or is this the secret room?
[115:37.88]Stars.
[115:38.22]I think the moon is secret room, right?
[115:39.54]Yeah.
[115:40.28]Take the diamonds.
[115:43.13]Where can we buy them?
[115:43.83]I will give you more details as we progress here over the next month or two.
[115:46.64]I think it'll take probably about... Give me a few weeks to get some more details.
[115:53.44]But it's happening soon, not like next year.
[115:55.80]Like soon, within the next probably 6 to 12 months.
[115:58.74]I would say give it like... Give me like a month before I can give you some real definitive information.
[116:04.25]But it's going to happen soon.
[116:07.43]Is it going to be US only?
[116:10.58]Let me just get that preliminarily figured out.
[116:12.34]There's a lot to figure out.
[116:13.70]I am able to actually announce that it's happening.
[116:16.12]Let me get the details.
[116:17.24]I'll let you know in the coming few weeks.
[116:20.03]Entrepreneur985.
[116:20.57]Not really.
[116:30.54]Remember, 12 months is a long time.
[116:32.02]No, I just meant six, like, I don't know.
[116:34.54]It's not gonna happen in a long time.
[116:36.10]It'll be, it'll be soon.
[116:42.54]Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.
[116:44.28]I want him too, trust me.
[116:51.50]Oh, come on.
[116:52.30]What's with that, like, tracking?
[117:00.57]EU fans are going to get fucked.
[117:02.21]No, I don't know that.
[117:03.75]I don't think that's accurate.
[117:05.93]Don't say that yet.
[117:06.81]I don't know if that's accurate.
[117:09.34]You don't know if that's a thing yet.
[117:11.60]How could you?
[117:14.62]Ooh.
[117:16.32]Annoyed that I used that bomb five seconds ago.
[117:22.55]Gotta be kidding me.
[117:26.91]New.
[117:28.13]Tooth and nail, you feel prickly.
[117:33.43]I feel prickly.
[117:34.55]Whoa.
[117:37.69]Is there... Did I make that happen somehow?
[117:39.51]Why do I start blinking?
[117:44.75]One, two... Can I move when it happens?
[117:47.19]Am I invincible?
[117:51.68]I wonder if I'm invincible when that happens.
[117:52.92]Because if that's invincible, that's ridiculous.
[117:59.02]Happens every five seconds and you're invincible.
[118:00.82]Holy shit, that's crazy.
[118:03.55]Wait, that means I can do this.
[118:06.31]Wow.
[118:12.72]Well, this is a cool new item.
[118:15.28]I don't want to screw this up.
[118:23.26]It's going to hurt me if I go near him.
[118:37.66]Time for all the cards to get scalped and all the prices are going to go up 500%.
[118:43.50]How do you know how we're going to do that?
[118:47.64]Woo!
[118:50.33]Prices now it's going to get scalped.
[118:59.25]Get the poop.
[118:59.89]Thank you.
[119:07.51]Limit production to a very small amount.
[119:14.16]I'll have details for you at some point soon.
[119:19.44]It's a full health, right?
[119:20.34]Alright, don't touch that.
[119:22.44]I want everyone to spam for me not to forget that, please.
[119:26.01]Don't let me forget that, sir.
[119:49.21]Shit.
[119:49.81]Bombs again.
[119:50.49]Thank god.
[119:56.96]No, I have... Wait.
[119:58.28]Keys.
[120:00.56]I can open up this.
[120:07.19]That's new.
[120:07.75]Whatever it is.
[120:08.29]I don't know.
[120:08.95]Is that like a dream catcher?
[120:11.89]What is that?
[120:12.31]Hmm.
[120:23.61]Alright, I need to make some money.
[120:28.21]Two of diamonds.
[120:28.83]Yeah, I don't want to use it right now, though.
[120:30.91]If I can make a little bit more money before I buy anything.
[120:33.18]I want to make as much money as I possibly can before I use it.
[120:40.92]Don't let me forget about that.
[120:42.22]Let me just test to make sure this works.
[120:43.38]Never mind.
[120:48.29]Don't let me forget.
[121:09.74]Doesn't he do some... Hold on.
[121:17.72]Oh, god damn it.
[121:18.36]Come on, dude.
[121:19.67]Come on, dude.
[121:28.77]I'm so paranoid of him blowing up in my face.
[121:36.81]Alright.
[121:37.81]So, we got box of stuff.
[121:39.71]Bomb.
[121:41.25]Oh, God.
[121:42.09]That's so much.
[121:43.57]Okay.
[121:43.95]Bomb.
[121:48.14]Diamonds.
[121:49.36]Hearts.
[121:52.20]Judgment.
[121:53.28]Oh, man.
[121:55.00]Okay.
[121:55.24]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[121:55.88]I think I can do this all.
[121:58.60]I think this is shot speed, right?
[122:00.27]Yep.
[122:03.63]So let's do diamonds.
[122:06.07]Not yet.
[122:06.86]No.
[122:07.60]What's in here?
[122:11.60]I hate that item.
[122:12.36]People are going to tell me to get it, but I fucking hate that thing.
[122:21.93]I don't want it.
[122:23.95]Alright.
[122:24.25]So I'm going to go.
[122:25.11]I'm not done yet.
[122:26.43]I'm going to go explore the rest of the room.
[122:27.75]So I have to remember all this stuff in order.
[122:33.14]Fight hard.
[122:33.52]I know, I know, I know.
[122:34.24]I get it.
[122:34.52]I'll get it.
[122:34.78]I'm looking to get as much money as I can because I want to give that guy a bunch of money.
[122:40.32]I want to buy the thing.
[122:41.54]I got a lot to do.
[122:44.48]I want this.
[122:53.46]Whatever it is.
[122:54.10]Obsessed fan follows your every move.
[123:09.29]That's me.
[123:12.63]No, you're fine.
[123:16.68]Mom?
[123:17.70]Cool, no more money.
[123:18.68]Alright, now it's time to do this in the right order.
[123:21.60]What is this?
[123:30.08]Broken syringe.
[123:31.08]Mystery medicines.
[123:33.74]Is broken syringe better than cancer?
[123:41.54]Probably not.
[123:42.76]It just gives you probably a random syringe item.
[123:45.44]Randomly.
[123:45.78]Alright, let's go.
[123:47.96]Like that.
[123:58.29]Let's double the money.
[124:00.83]I'm going to buy whatever this is.
[124:04.09]Sweet dreams.
[124:15.48]No idea.
[124:15.72]And then we're going to give these coins to the guy down here.
[124:26.02]It tells you what the boss... What does it do?
[124:29.18]During the dream in between floors, you will see something.
[124:33.54]Whoa.
[124:37.32]Funny enthusiasm?
[124:38.34]Whoa.
[124:41.54]Come on.
[124:42.58]Come on.
[124:46.81]Oh, no.
[124:47.63]It's just enough to kill you.
[124:53.55]I'll take it.
[124:53.91]Hey, it was worth it.
[124:59.30]Alright, do not skip the cutscene.
[125:00.86]Alright.
[125:09.92]Bomb, and it's the Fallen.
[125:14.94]That's... Alright, that's kind of cool.
[125:26.27]Small.
[125:31.47]Tears up.
[125:32.11]Hell yeah.
[125:34.55]And infested twice.
[125:42.61]Super pride.
[125:43.27]These guys are always so easy.
[125:44.67]Oh, I don't even know what happened.
[125:51.45]I like these explosive fire tears, but they really do suck sometimes.
[125:58.21]They really are.
[125:58.97]Because they just blow up in your face.
[126:06.14]Like that.
[126:22.64]Quagmire.
[126:26.33]Cool bombs.
[126:26.83]I'll take them.
[126:35.35]So I have a question for those of you that know.
[126:36.85]This is... Effectively, this is Antibirth.
[126:43.53]Right?
[126:44.98]I've played Antibirth a little bit.
[126:48.14]How much is this... How close is this to being just Antibirth?
[126:54.90]Homing bombs, homing bombs.
[126:58.02]Or did they change a significant amount of stuff?
[126:59.94]And by the way, does this work in here if I go like this?
[127:03.74]Did I miss the timing?
[127:08.89]It's like Antibirth twice, okay.
[127:18.92]Oh, goodness.
[127:25.90]Paranoid for the explosions.
[127:33.50]Way more with the new endings, okay.
[127:43.85]Unlock these for free.
[127:49.39]Don't touch that.
[127:49.85]I don't think I can take that off.
[127:53.77]25 coins.
[127:54.29]Alright.
[127:55.10]That's a tick, right?
[127:56.38]I can't pick that off.
[127:58.20]Unless I burn it with a matchstick.
[128:11.15]The Emperor.
[128:11.81]I don't want to use this right now.
[128:13.95]Come on.
[128:15.49]I'm just guessing.
[128:16.09]Who cares?
[128:18.77]Charged, baby.
[128:19.51]What's with all these... What's with my seeds?
[128:22.38]Why do I have so much of this?
[128:29.90]I have so many battery items.
[128:32.64]I need an active now.
[128:33.50]Glouse.
[128:36.55]Itchy.
[128:36.91]Tasty.
[128:37.69]Okay, no.
[128:38.01]I don't want that.
[128:52.85]Gooey gooey?
[128:58.52]What's that gooey gooey?
[129:03.24]Nothing.
[129:03.52]Uh, let's just kill him.
[129:09.80]The Fallen.
[129:10.24]I told you it was the Fallen.
[129:10.98]You guys said it wasn't.
[129:24.04]Excuse me.
[129:24.50]Oh, I thought he was dead.
[129:32.34]I thought that was his death animation.
[129:35.64]Missing page two.
[129:36.78]Evil up, your enemies will pay.
[129:41.08]That's different.
[129:41.58]That's new in this.
[129:42.64]Missing page two.
[129:45.00]What does that do?
[129:49.67]It's a bad item.
[129:50.39]Restart.
[129:52.13]Enemies will pay.
[129:55.61]No, it's not new.
[129:59.36]I'm sorry, but the Red Sox suck.
[130:01.06]Whatever.
[130:01.32]They just got smashed with two home runs back-to-back by the Orioles.
[130:03.96]I know you're from Boston, but come on, dude.
[130:07.34]Sorry.
[130:07.98]I'll try harder next time in the next game.
[130:21.93]You let us down.
[130:23.19]Oh, I'm sorry.
[130:28.87]Yeah, it's like a voodoo doll.
[130:31.73]If you're from Boston and... It's like somebody... A Boston pitcher lets up a grand slam.
[130:36.90]We all feel pain in our necks.
[130:40.44]Ah!
[130:41.51]What... Ah, what happened?
[130:48.45]Loser.
[130:58.27]When Tom Brady got traded to Tampa Bay, where we left to go to Tampa Bay, I'm fairly certain collectively everybody in Massachusetts woke up with a stomach pain.
[131:09.83]It was like, I feel awful today.
[131:11.51]I feel like I'm going to puke.
[131:14.85]What happened?
[131:15.90]Did I eat something?
[131:19.24]Collectively, every single person in Massachusetts all called out of work at the same time.
[131:24.52]Oh, with a pill, yeah.
[131:39.25]Ooh, speed up and tears up.
[131:41.03]What else do I need here?
[131:49.17]I know, I go slow.
[131:50.33]I'm sorry.
[131:57.56]Collectively, everybody is affected.
[132:08.09]Yeah, when the Red Sox won the World Series in like 2004, everybody in Boston had like a collective overheal for a week.
[132:14.01]Ooh, what's that?
[132:17.53]I don't even know what that was.
[132:33.98]I love how much I can... I love how much I can...
[132:38.38]Settle down, dude.
[132:39.18]What are we doing?
[132:42.38]Oh, that's a sing-songy.
[132:43.62]I love how much I can help.
[132:53.35]Holy shit, that guy has a lot of health.
[133:00.85]That's the challenge heart.
[133:02.05]That makes the game really hard, but makes you do more... It doesn't do anything.
[133:13.10]If you beat the game of the challenge hard on, doesn't it do something?
[133:20.03]God, I'm loving these new items.
[133:21.17]I love these new items in this Isaac game.
[133:33.10]Sounds irritating.
[133:33.88]Do I?
[133:36.26]I was earlier.
[133:38.45]Two hours ago, when the computer started to freak out for no reason, I was like, yeah, I was pissed.
[133:43.59]Holy shit, they move fast.
[133:56.96]I'm still low on hearts.
[133:58.14]Did they nerf the amount of hearts you get in Repentance?
[134:01.50]I feel like they did.
[134:03.94]I've not gotten very many, any HP up items.
[134:08.53]They did.
[134:08.83]They did.
[134:09.91]Oh, they did.
[134:11.97]They nerfed hard mode hard.
[134:16.29]So now it's hard, hard, hard.
[134:18.39]Oh.
[134:18.49]I was wondering.
[134:22.23]I felt like I haven't gotten any HP up items.
[134:24.05]Damn, okay.
[134:24.89]They wanted to make it hard.
[134:32.95]So, is it... Am I like a normie if I play the game on normal?
[134:37.03]Or did they make hard really hard and make normal harder?
[134:48.08]Still normie.
[134:49.10]Oh.
[134:51.86]You're completely valid if you play on normal.
[134:55.36]I'm just going to blow this guy up.
[134:58.70]Hold on.
[135:01.60]No Could I have oh wait could I have done that without with the I Think I could have done that I doing like this and walking into him shit, maybe not It's a stupid blow up tears, I hate this shit Exploding tears.
[135:22.63]I have so much tears up.
[135:23.55]I'm so paranoid.
[135:24.25]I'm gonna hurt myself, but I don't shoot I
[135:37.49]Is this?
[135:38.99]Shielded tears.
[135:39.97]These are all okay.
[135:48.43]Now that's good.
[135:50.81]You're fucked now.
[135:51.67]Wait, no, I am.
[135:52.27]You're right.
[135:52.55]Because now they're going to blow up on projectiles.
[135:56.91]That was a horrible thing to pick up.
[135:59.36]Oops.
[136:09.42]Run ruined?
[136:10.30]Not yet.
[136:12.00]It's still doable.
[136:30.48]Die.
[136:33.29]Any tinted rocks?
[136:33.87]No.
[136:35.07]Activate Fortnite mode.
[136:40.17]I could just say, I bet you guys haven't seen me in a while.
[136:42.15]Of course I know the song.
[136:44.03]Yeah, I sing it all the time.
[136:47.39]All the fucking time.
[136:55.94]It just appears every day.
[136:58.00]It never goes away.
[136:59.14]Every day.
[137:00.82]I don't know why.
[137:01.98]It's better than the original song.
[137:05.71]You know, I never really, I don't listen to that much music anymore.
[137:09.77]But that original song that it's sort of a remix of, I listened to that recently.
[137:15.57]I was like, oh, I really like the Fortnite song.
[137:19.86]Maybe I'll like the original song.
[137:21.46]It's not even close to the same thing.
[137:22.62]It's completely different.
[137:23.68]And it's way better.
[137:26.80]The Victory Royale song is way better than the original.
[137:38.76]Whoever owns the rights to that song, I would just make that the song.
[137:42.56]I'd be like, holy shit, you just took what I did and holy, oh my goodness, it's incredible.
[137:46.41]I think this is where I die.
[137:51.25]Double trouble?
[138:13.57]I'm going to lose to that.
[138:25.64]I'm about to get down.
[138:27.10]10 kills on the board right now.
[138:28.50]Just wiped out Tomato Town.
[138:31.80]My friend just got downed.
[138:33.37]I revived him and we're going southbound.
[138:36.37]None of the park, we're going south street.
[138:38.27]None of the park, we're going park street.
[138:52.89]I don't... I have bombs.
[138:54.69]I could do it.
[138:55.99]I could look.
[138:56.37]Yeah!
[139:04.28]Only... Oh, first try.
[139:06.98]And it's matches.
[139:08.54]Who cares?
[139:19.27]We got a... That's the best part of the whole song.
[139:22.25]It's
[139:22.96]We gotta... We gotta... Number one.
[139:30.11]Number one.
[139:31.17]That's another good part.
[139:45.25]You guys think Fortnite's gonna last as long as Minecraft?
[139:47.11]Or do you think that it's just the thing right now?
[139:50.60]I did not think Fortnite was gonna stick around.
[139:53.18]I thought it was gonna be a thing that people thought was cool for a little bit, but I did not expect it to be like this.
[140:03.72]Come on.
[140:04.32]Really?
[140:07.18]What?
[140:07.32]I'm not even gonna blow that one up out of principle.
[140:11.52]Fortnite's gonna last forever.
[140:13.14]I don't know.
[140:16.18]What can it be compared to?
[140:20.84]When did Fortnite come out?
[140:22.08]Fortnite came out and it was like Plants vs. Zombies base building survival game.
[140:28.92]It took a few years for it to be the thing that it is now.
[140:31.82]2017? 2016?
[140:45.79]I wonder how much time it has left.
[140:55.18]Summer 2017.
[140:55.42]TF2 started as MVM and then they added player versus player.
[141:04.48]Yeah, kind of.
[141:12.20]I wonder how many stock options they gave the guy.
[141:15.56]That said, let's put Battle Royale in this.
[141:20.38]Did that guy get enough stock options for the rest of his life to be taken care of?
[141:35.33]Juicy sack.
[141:36.17]Sticky babies.
[141:41.12]Absolutely not.
[141:44.42]I got a gift card.
[141:53.06]But to where?
[141:55.56]Where?
[141:55.96]Where did you get the gift card to?
[142:02.93]You know that I gauge how much I appreciate a gift card or not?
[142:09.05]This is my kind of gift card tier list, as you will.
[142:14.62]So if you go into, like, Walmart and grab, like, an Applebee's gift card.
[142:19.28]Mmm, ah, it didn't, that didn't take very, you just grab the first one.
[142:30.66]I gauge how much I appreciate a gift card, whether or not I've been to the restaurant in five years.
[142:35.75]Or been to the place, the, like, store in five years.
[142:40.95]I got, I got a Chili's gift card!
[142:44.01]Oh, I haven't eaten here in probably, it's seven and a half years.
[142:46.83]That was the first one on the rack that you saw at Walmart.
[142:53.77]At least make it, at least make it a fucking Fortnite card.
[142:55.73]Chili's is perfect.
[143:03.41]I haven't eaten there in a long time.
[143:04.65]Is it good?
[143:05.13]Do they still do the, like, you can get, well, come with a friend and get two entrees and you get a second entree for like five bucks or something?
[143:18.83]Did I not do that anymore?
[143:22.04]They used to do that, right?
[143:22.86]It was... If you were two people, you could get two entrees, and the second entree was like 10 bucks or something.
[143:28.78]Or like 8 bucks.
[143:32.78]It was two for 20.
[143:33.71]Yeah.
[143:41.33]If two people were in the restaurant together, they could get two entrees.
[143:56.39]That was Applebee's?
[144:02.47]Right.
[144:02.99]But, I mean... I'm sorry.
[144:05.31]Applebee's, Friday's, and Chili's are the same place.
[144:08.12]In my head.
[144:10.44]The decor inside.
[144:11.58]The menu.
[144:12.72]The atmosphere.
[144:13.46]I cannot... I couldn't tell you what was on what menu.
[144:18.87]Remember, Applebee's had the riblets, which I loved.
[144:21.93]They were these weird, like, square rib things.
[144:25.79]And they had little tiny, not very much meat on them at all.
[144:28.89]You had to scrape your teeth on the edges to, like, pull off a little bit of meat.
[144:32.55]They were called riblets.
[144:34.77]I don't know what the hell they were.
[144:36.66]But I loved them.
[144:37.46]I don't even know what those actually were.
[144:42.20]They were rats.
[144:46.52]Fuck off.
[144:51.21]I have no idea.
[144:51.59]I've never seen this before.
[144:52.23]It looked like square ribs.
[144:53.15]It wasn't like beef ribs.
[144:54.05]What was it?
[144:55.82]What actually was it, though?
[145:02.10]Stop.
[145:02.40]You're hurting him.
[145:03.26]I'm alright.
[145:04.80]What were the riblets from Applebee's?
[145:12.81]It's the same thing as a McRib.
[145:13.93]No, no, no.
[145:14.43]It was a bony.
[145:15.23]It was a cartilagy.
[145:16.09]30% of
[145:21.00]The animal doesn't exist anymore.
[145:24.66]I think they just cut ribs in half.
[145:27.98]It was these weird... They were squares.
[145:29.56]They were squares.
[145:30.46]Connected squares.
[145:32.22]Riblets.
[145:34.89]Google it in incognito mode.
[145:44.17]Come on.
[145:44.67]Give me something.
[145:45.19]Are you kidding me?
[145:58.00]Come on!
[145:59.32]Ugh!
[146:01.30]No!
[146:01.66]I'm on hearts, so I can keep doing this.
[146:19.93]Shot speed up.
[146:32.45]Come on, hurry up.
[146:35.09]Alright, that's enough.
[146:35.67]That's enough.
[146:36.09]One more.
[146:37.15]That's enough.
[146:39.63]I got what I wanted.
[146:41.56]Start the bomb.
[146:44.80]Ooh, that's the hoop hoop.
[146:49.54]I don't have enough range to make this work.
[147:06.84]Okay.
[147:09.36]Oh, shit.
[147:10.78]Jera multiplies everything in the room.
[147:14.73]Oh, well.
[147:15.37]Damn it.
[147:16.81]I could get two... Give me this back.
[147:24.67]I don't want the poop poop.
[147:25.47]It's not going to be good.
[147:27.45]Jera.
[147:34.28]Okay.
[147:34.58]I don't want any of that stuff.
[147:37.32]But I think that's actually accurate.
[148:06.17]Which is not, not really.
[148:15.42]Shit, I don't like this.
[148:21.66]Ah!
[148:23.00]Ah!
[148:27.96]Ah!
[148:28.06]I'm the poison.
[148:28.70]How much damage do I have?
[148:30.33]Not enough.
[148:43.22]Abundance.
[148:43.68]There's so much charging.
[148:44.82]Okay.
[148:45.62]Did they buff batteries?
[148:48.48]Because I see them all the time now.
[148:51.52]They had to have, right?
[148:52.34]Am I just getting weird RNG or something?
[149:01.17]Okay.
[149:12.16]There's smaller batteries that give less charge.
[149:14.00]Hmm.
[149:16.79]Didn't they across the board buff active items in the first place?
[149:21.07]I feel like that's something they did.
[149:22.95]They did that.
[149:25.95]Active items are now good.
[149:28.73]A lot of them weren't very good at all.
[149:44.59]Here's Guppy.
[149:45.43]Eternal life.
[149:50.66]I made it!
[149:51.26]I got really unnecessarily angry at that.
[150:16.53]You're supposed to be the easiest boss in the game.
[150:17.83]You're making me look bad.
[150:27.85]What is this?
[150:28.29]A trash can thing?
[150:30.75]Super dog?
[150:32.37]You're making me look bad.
[150:37.43]Compost.
[150:37.90]Gain more friends.
[150:49.41]What did I just do?
[150:49.81]Did that just give me more spiders?
[151:01.20]Whoa.
[151:08.91]Man, that's a lot.
[151:15.43]Spider Andy.
[151:16.33]Okay.
[151:17.17]I'm going to go down.
[151:32.82]Kill.
[151:38.91]Watch the explosions.
[151:41.51]Oh, come on.
[151:42.23]I didn't even see it on the screen.
[151:56.07]Oh!
[151:57.57]Rusty.
[151:59.27]I'm so rusty at Isaac.
[152:03.03]I'm so much better at the game.
[152:13.75]Uh, that's Eve.
[152:15.70]I don't want it.
[152:23.08]Crusty, crusty Andy.
[152:29.57]They did make hard mode harder, to be fair.
[152:32.63]It does feel like it.
[152:33.45]That's cool, though.
[152:35.85]It did get to a point where people were playing and just destroying every single time.
[152:42.56]Is this a new expansion?
[152:44.10]Isaac is hard?
[152:45.40]Did they make it difficult?
[152:49.34]How are people reacting to it?
[152:52.32]People saying, like, too hard.
[152:53.74]Don't want to play it.
[152:58.77]Hard mode was no harder than normal mode.
[153:00.85]Well, I mean, with all the champions, they added a bunch of champions and less... It was, yeah, like, purple and, like, green and blue enemies, right?
[153:10.20]Like, champions weren't a thing that much in normal, were they?
[153:12.24]I thought I can remember.
[153:26.68]Champions.
[153:27.72]Yeah.
[153:30.05]The monsters that are normal monsters, but they're bigger and green.
[153:35.37]Champion monsters.
[153:36.49]Elites, or whatever you want to call them.
[153:37.56]I don't know.
[153:37.84]What happened to those keys?
[153:54.56]Oh, that's what compost does.
[153:55.78]Okay, right, right, okay.
[153:56.66]Makes sense.
[154:03.67]Is that going to hurt if I touch it?
[154:04.63]Tears up.
[154:11.64]And... Yep.
[154:13.08]Okay.
[154:13.94]And... One of these.
[154:15.34]Champions are brighter now.
[154:20.22]Are they?
[154:22.48]Oh, lord.
[154:36.56]What are this guy on the top left who cares about you?
[154:41.86]I guess if I get a room that's full of stuff, I could Jera and then compost and probably get a shitload of stuff.
[154:47.28]Oh, come on.
[154:56.99]Really?
[155:06.11]Mr. Fred.
[155:14.85]He'll break off, but it doesn't matter.
[155:24.30]Stay... Just stay safe right here.
[155:35.04]We got up.
[155:38.14]That looks to be new.
[155:39.48]What's this?
[155:40.54]Super glue?
[155:41.98]Eye drops.
[155:51.43]That seems really fast.
[155:54.05]That was a fucking disgusting boss.
[155:55.85]Why?
[156:05.58]tier cap got raised too?
[156:07.68]Did it really?
[156:08.18]Because I've always I've always wanted that to be a thing.
[156:14.83]Why put a tier cap?
[156:15.71]That always felt This is infinite, isn't it?
[156:21.03]What?
[156:28.54]What?
[156:40.73]Just be happy that I was not streaming when that was a huge thing that everybody was talking about for the week it came out.
[156:54.22]My streams would have been unbearable.
[157:04.84]It would have been horrible.
[157:15.66]Cover it.
[157:17.04]I just did.
[157:21.00]I'm not gonna cover Victory Royale.
[157:23.56]I don't even know what the song is called.
[157:36.90]It's called Chug Jug With You.
[157:39.49]What is jug?
[157:42.95]Chug jug?
[157:43.87]Is jug something like a Fortnite thing?
[157:46.52]Jug, chug, jug.
[157:53.70]Jug is... I don't know what jug is.
[157:57.96]Chug jug is an item.
[158:00.66]Oh, okay.
[158:06.47]Alright, here we go.
[158:07.39]Guys, it's gonna be intense.
[158:09.63]Can I beat this?
[158:10.69]Can I beat mom?
[158:12.37]It lives, I wonder.
[158:13.77]Give me your best luck here.
[158:37.46]Shielded tears.
[158:39.64]Doing good.
[158:40.40]Oh, not enough damage to do it in one revolution.
[158:50.78]Aw.
[158:51.99]You unlocked blast, baby.
[158:54.37]Dude.
[158:57.05]Alright, so where should I go?
[159:06.95]I don't think that, no, that's not new.
[159:08.21]That's the thing that just flies around and if you shoot through it, right?
[159:10.49]I don't want that.
[159:14.53]You got the Polaroid to go up, yeah.
[159:18.39]I don't want this thing.
[159:22.17]Tomato town.
[159:24.35]You got it?
[159:25.23]Number one victory, Royal.
[159:26.79]You have four seconds left to get down.
[159:29.55]10 kills on the board right now.
[159:33.32]Just wiped out tomato time.
[159:35.36]The face shakes and the eyes look up.
[159:42.31]What is... Oh, God.
[159:44.71]Is there more of those?
[159:47.29]Hey, look at this.
[160:15.50]No.
[160:15.78]Are you kidding me?
[160:16.94]I ran right out of there.
[160:17.88]Oh, yeah.
[160:38.35]Ah.
[160:38.93]Oh, it's because the spikes are on the ground.
[160:40.30]I didn't even see the spikes.
[160:43.16]Oh, crap.
[160:52.55]Oh, come on.
[160:53.17]What's a spawn?
[161:02.48]You're so bad.
[161:03.40]Whatever.
[161:05.20]How many victory royales have you gotten in the last month?
[161:10.75]Probably not very...
[161:22.40]What's this bag?
[161:23.02]Is this a Sin Heart bag?
[161:24.66]I don't really think I want this.
[161:31.30]Take that, though.
[161:36.51]Alright, keep going.
[161:43.79]I got more hearts.
[161:51.33]Holy shit.
[162:03.78]Holy shit.
[162:06.48]Whoa.
[162:08.22]That was cool.
[162:08.80]That enemy's cool.
[162:10.93]I like that new enemy eyeball.
[162:26.72]Is it rocks?
[162:32.14]I'm gonna say down.
[162:41.49]I hate these little guys.
[162:43.35]Weird like leech eyeball things.
[162:44.75]They're so annoying.
[162:57.67]Super magnet, it pulls.
[162:59.75]No, I don't want that.
[163:00.69]I don't want the speed.
[163:03.99]Quick, doi doi doi.
[163:05.97]Maybe I'll give you a doi doi doi in like a few minutes.
[163:08.79]Maybe.
[163:09.97]It'd be good though.
[163:21.52]Range is pretty bad too.
[163:24.64]Bad range.
[163:29.28]I'll give it to you, I will.
[163:30.32]But you have to be good.
[163:34.44]Do a chug, jug, chug, jug, doy, doy.
[163:36.94]I've seen that guy before.
[163:40.43]What's this guy's deal?
[163:45.45]I don't know.
[163:47.47]Like a cross on his head?
[163:57.06]Do you want doy doy chug jug?
[163:59.74]Okay.
[164:03.02]It's the best I can do.
[164:04.50]Alright, Isaac.
[164:05.38]Time to die.
[164:06.24]And then we go to the chest from here?
[164:08.43]Whatever I have unlocked, I don't know.
[164:36.22]Well, they changed that.
[164:39.56]Oh, did they make it so you can't just stand in the corner and not get hit at Isaac anymore?
[164:43.08]Oh, okay.
[164:46.16]It's still there.
[165:00.17]Updated animations and sounds though.
[165:10.61]He looks way cooler.
[165:11.55]Isaac!
[165:22.52]Alright, do I have to end it here?
[165:27.92]Or can I keep going?
[165:30.21]If I've beaten the game on this save file, like, 40 times, that means I probably have the chest, right?
[165:35.66]I think so, right?
[165:36.44]Yeah.
[165:50.32]Ooh, what's this?
[165:51.68]Sci-Fly.
[165:53.02]Unboyant Protector.
[165:55.80]Friendly Ball.
[165:56.50]Eh, I don't want that.
[166:00.21]Ouija board, spectral tears, and Mr. Mega.
[166:08.06]Jera, Jera, Jera, Jera.
[166:10.32]Rune, you bastard.
[166:11.78]Rune doesn't do anything.
[166:31.25]No!
[166:33.13]Get away.
[166:34.71]Look at all this poison.
[166:35.73]The poison lasts so much longer on the ground.
[166:37.41]It took like 10 hits.
[166:41.31]I took so many hits.
[166:42.01]The poison was lasting so long.
[166:44.96]That's new.
[166:45.94]It doesn't usually last that long.
[167:01.84]What?
[167:04.71]I could have had eight items.
[167:07.99]Oh, Jera counts for chest?
[167:09.79]I thought it was only consumables.
[167:10.79]Is it any physical item in the game?
[167:13.69]Is that new?
[167:14.81]I thought Jera was just a consumable.
[167:24.12]It's consumables and chests.
[167:26.70]What?
[167:29.14]Oh, I thought it was just like coins, bombs, cards.
[167:32.37]Oh, shit.
[167:33.87]As long as the chest is closed.
[167:35.15]Oh, alright.
[167:35.91]I didn't know that.
[167:43.20]I hate not knowing how much health I have.
[167:46.50]That sucks.
[168:10.62]Oh, he's hit.
[168:11.92]Oh, he's hit.
[168:20.15]How many of you are in this room?
[168:21.47]Come on, man.
[168:28.14]I already...
[168:41.84]Oh, what was that?
[168:43.90]What was that?
[168:44.98]It was like a trinket or something.
[168:46.84]I don't know what it was.
[168:47.90]It's gone, whatever it is.
[168:48.98]Do more shoe?
[168:52.41]Something like that, right?
[169:15.75]Got it.
[169:19.95]Never seen this guy before.
[169:20.91]It's a new enemy.
[169:22.88]Oh.
[169:24.24]Aaron.
[169:27.34]No, Aaron.
[169:28.94]Aaron.
[169:30.53]Aaron, run away, Aaron.
[169:52.48]Half of you guys have no idea what that is.
[169:55.38]It makes it even funnier for me.
[170:13.57]Fuck, is it Eren?
[170:14.67]No.
[170:15.03]I'm not even gonna talk about it.
[170:18.44]Just, whatever.
[170:19.84]Fucking, let me play the game that I spent $15 on, by the way.
[170:23.88]I spent $15 on this.
[170:43.97]Hey, did you miss me?
[170:45.17]Hey, did you miss me?
[170:46.15]I didn't even take one damage that, like, five minutes.
[171:07.28]No, don't hit me.
[171:12.42]Watch out, there's bugs!
[171:14.21]These bugs are dangerous!
[171:27.40]I've been waiting for you to say this, please just say it.
[171:29.86]Why?
[171:32.10]What if I ever made like a reference to that?
[171:34.34]Oh shit, this is bad.
[171:44.57]This is very bad.
[171:45.21]Gotta go.
[171:51.85]One of you's gotta go.
[171:53.97]Please.
[171:57.39]One of you's gotta... Kept you waiting, huh?
[172:00.11]That was for that one person.
[172:00.99]I don't care.
[172:02.79]It was really bad.
[172:03.59]That was really bad.
[172:05.53]But I did it for that one person.
[172:07.40]They probably hated it too.
[172:10.42]Whatever.
[172:11.95]It was just for that one person and they wanted me to do like a Sonic the Snake.
[172:16.67]It's not Sonic the Hedgehog.
[172:24.51]Kill him before he runs at you!
[172:25.98]They're both in the same Smash Brothers universe.
[172:42.39]Uh-oh.
[172:42.73]Uh-oh.
[172:45.29]I think this is the end.
[172:51.29]Oh, Mega Lard.
[172:52.79]HP up.
[173:13.96]Okay, I need to collect as many hearts as I can here.
[173:24.66]What's the boss even here?
[173:25.66]Is it a blue baby?
[173:26.86]I honestly don't even know.
[173:30.40]I might as well look for the secret rooms.
[173:55.40]Okay.
[173:55.86]Oh, whatever.
[173:56.22]I'm just gonna go for it.
[173:56.94]If I lose, I lose.
[173:57.82]I'm kind of rusty.
[174:00.86]I haven't played Isaac in a while.
[174:03.32]And they made hard mode harder.
[174:05.74]So, it's like the game is actually way harder for me because I haven't played in a while.
[174:09.68]And I'm used to it being a little easier.
[174:11.32]So, that's my excuse.
[174:13.17]I was just burped.
[174:21.29]Pain versus blue baby.
[174:39.31]Shielded Tears are very good.
[174:49.25]Do do do do do do do do do do do do.
[175:00.95]I remember, didn't I try to play beat the hush on stream one time?
[175:03.65]I beat the hush like twice or three times ever.
[175:05.37]I did it once on stream.
[175:08.35]Don't you have to have a stupid build to even try?
[175:12.98]And if you don't have a build that's absolutely just dumb, you just quit, right?
[175:17.76]That's what I remember.
[175:20.72]I did it.
[175:31.29]EA.
[175:32.81]EA.
[175:33.39]EA.
[175:33.99]EA.
[175:35.18]Gabby J. EA.
[175:38.72]I've done it again.
[175:39.52]I did that like a month ago.
[175:40.24]Are you sitting in your own poop right now?
[176:01.67]um why don't we check ow I'm gonna I'm gonna get up and sit down really quickly and we'll see I'm gonna sit up I'm standing and sitting down I don't think so let's try it again I don't I don't feel it doesn't feel weird alright cool let's go again
[176:31.77]Uh, I have to beat... Oh, I must have the voice.
[176:38.59]Too bad.
[176:40.17]Uh, let's do Lazarus.
[176:42.55]Let me try to get to Mom's heart in 30 minutes.
[176:44.12]I mean, no fucking around.
[176:45.16]Let's go.
[176:45.98]You want to see how you play Lazarus?
[176:47.20]I'll show you.
[177:00.23]That's how you play Lazarus.
[177:03.94]Myostosis.
[177:05.96]Forget me not.
[177:14.94]I don't know what that does.
[177:17.88]I thought that was a legitimate mistake for a second.
[177:21.48]No, you die as Lazarus.
[177:23.16]You come back.
[177:23.56]You get the stat increases.
[177:24.62]You use the pill.
[177:25.29]And if the pill is bad, you restart the game.
[177:37.54]That's the Lazarus Shred.
[177:49.68]Who knew this would be a diaper scream?
[177:53.82]Every scream is a diaper scream.
[177:56.26]What are you guys saying?
[178:08.44]Even the carnival.
[178:11.59]Yeah.
[178:41.24]Let me show you the Samson strat.
[178:55.16]My favorite character in the game is Samson.
[178:58.06]I find him to be the most fun.
[179:03.46]Bad strat.
[179:05.00]What do you even know?
[179:06.88]Have you ever played Binding of Isaac?
[179:08.78]I bet you you haven't.
[179:11.14]The Dio.
[179:11.88]I think this just rerolls consumables.
[179:19.51]Not a great start.
[179:23.81]Not a great start.
[179:25.11]Could be worse.
[179:25.79]That guy's huge.
[179:46.76]repentance guys huge come on where are you I mean you seem this guy seems off
[180:09.75]You mean like in general or you mean today?
[180:11.09]I don't know.
[180:13.46]I think I feel okay right now.
[180:16.04]I'm on, I think.
[180:16.94]I think I'm on.
[180:17.96]What would you consider off?
[180:28.13]On CBD?
[180:30.39]No, not right now.
[180:32.57]Not knock that away.
[180:42.68]He doesn't want to play this game.
[180:45.55]I really do, actually.
[180:48.15]I've been looking forward to this update since it was announced like two years ago or something.
[181:13.24]Damage and range up.
[181:14.82]I like it.
[181:16.52]Oh, no.
[181:17.17]It's only one eye, though.
[181:18.41]This item sucks.
[181:22.85]After all that Santa talk, you have to be high on something.
[181:27.51]I don't think so.
[181:36.11]Why do I have the curse again?
[181:49.02]Ooh, nice.
[181:50.52]Five cents.
[181:54.80]Wait, what if I... I could roll... What did I just do?
[182:05.06]Wait, what does this even do?
[182:05.92]I thought it rerolled consumables.
[182:18.14]It rerolls enemies.
[182:22.70]Okay.
[182:23.20]And you don't want to do that until the last floors.
[182:27.96]If you do it here, you could get end game enemies and die instantly.
[182:35.39]I saw it.
[182:35.75]Don't worry.
[182:36.03]I'll go get it later.
[182:45.34]End game, Peter.
[182:47.06]It's funny that I can just say that and you guys will say end game, Peter.
[182:53.13]Like somebody will.
[182:53.83]Even if it's only one of you.
[182:54.95]I really like that.
[183:06.21]I want it.
[183:14.55]Disappointing.
[183:15.15]I don't like getting little gish.
[183:16.71]It's always a disappointment when you see his face.
[183:19.37]Tell me I'm wrong.
[183:20.51]Tell me I'm wrong when you see that little gish.
[183:23.37]You don't go, fuck, and want to restart.
[183:25.34]I'm just telling you.
[183:46.37]Alright, fuck it.
[183:46.83]Let's see what we got.
[184:02.98]Good for Samson.
[184:04.86]One more.
[184:05.14]Alright, that's enough.
[184:07.42]I think I'm at max.
[184:10.19]Little Gish saved my run before.
[184:14.04]I'd rather have passive stats.
[184:16.38]I'm a passive stat kind of guy in Isaac.
[184:18.12]I don't really like the familiars.
[184:20.12]They can be cool.
[184:21.72]But I like having interesting passive stat combinations.
[184:24.85]I don't really like the active items.
[184:26.11]I don't really like the friends.
[184:27.77]I like the passive items.
[184:33.51]And that's it.
[184:35.73]Don't let me forget the red heart.
[184:42.59]Imagine if you can reroll bosses.
[184:48.25]I hiccuped after that.
[184:48.97]That was not like a fake laugh or anything.
[184:51.07]What is this?
[184:55.70]Consolation prize plus one to the lowest stat.
[185:02.30]Oh, it's kind of terrible.
[185:11.75]That's really bad.
[185:13.39]Um, I have money.
[185:22.76]Don't want that.
[185:24.66]What's this, um, purple saddle thing do?
[185:27.00]Can I get them both?
[185:35.85]I can't.
[185:39.51]Purple one doubles the card effects.
[185:44.03]Oh wow, that's actually really good.
[185:45.07]I don't think I can get both though.
[185:50.29]Arrowcloth.
[185:52.31]Temperance.
[185:55.33]Temperance.
[185:56.15]Nice.
[186:04.92]I need that!
[186:06.08]How do I get that?
[186:06.64]What do you mean wasted?
[186:09.40]There could have been coins in there and make me allowed to buy the card thing.
[186:13.48]Alright, I could pick this up and there could be two pennies in it.
[186:49.10]Alright, I can get it.
[186:52.81]Double card effects.
[186:54.77]Incoming.
[186:58.37]Judgment times two is the little guy, right?
[187:05.26]Judgment's the coin bomb.
[187:09.22]Cool.
[187:09.66]I get two judgments.
[187:11.00]That's a pretty cool build.
[187:14.81]Anything else I can get?
[187:15.85]Eternal heart.
[187:19.95]Where was that?
[187:20.53]Over here.
[187:33.26]D10.
[187:40.08]Some of the two judgments versus Satan.
[187:42.40]That do anything?
[187:45.87]You're so broke now with no bombs or keys.
[187:47.91]I don't think that matters though.
[187:50.97]If I can get good cards.
[187:51.97]If I can get like the Hierophant.
[187:54.70]Once or... It's going to be awesome.
[187:56.40]Look at this already.
[187:59.16]I'm good.
[188:10.71]Ooh, a Satan voice.
[188:14.64]No.
[188:16.46]You do it.
[188:22.60]Satan face.
[188:23.50]Yeah.
[188:24.42]I hate when games do Satan faces.
[188:26.13]It's scary.
[188:31.07]Alright, somebody hit me.
[188:38.11]I want more damage.
[188:49.97]I'll tell you what, Goku.
[188:50.99]God damn it.
[189:00.15]Say it right.
[189:00.83]Oh my god, don't die!
[189:05.59]I had stuff!
[189:06.81]No!
[189:07.40]That was so cool, too.
[189:09.30]I can't, like, play a video game and talk.
[189:11.68]Like, I have to pause the movie.
[189:16.68]You know what I mean?
[189:19.08]Once I start being like, oh, I have to go through.
[189:22.24]I have to stop.
[189:23.28]The movie has to pause.
[189:34.11]Like, if you want to do like a Jim Carrey impression while we're watching Ace Ventura, I got to pause the movie.
[189:41.86]God damn it.
[189:42.54]That was a cool build, too.
[189:55.66]Pause Shrek.
[189:58.96]Stop getting hit?
[189:59.60]No, I'm doing it on purpose.
[190:01.74]Oh shit, he's doing it on purpose.
[190:04.32]He's doing this on purpose.
[190:07.58]Finally, we figured it out.
[190:08.56]We got him.
[190:09.25]He admitted it.
[190:09.79]Don't ever pause Shrek.
[190:25.36]You know, they're like... When was the last time you heard of... Shrek is like on the way out, isn't he?
[190:30.51]It hasn't been like a movie in a while.
[190:39.07]Shrek's kind of on the way out.
[190:49.21]He's losing, I think, popularity.
[190:51.82]I'm not sure he's in with the kids now.
[191:00.28]Good, key.
[191:00.82]How fucking dare you?
[191:05.85]I- no, I- I love Shrek!
[191:07.53]I love Shrek, I'm just saying.
[191:08.73]I think he- I think he's- I don't think he's as popular as everybody thinks he is now.
[191:13.05]He's lost a lot to Fortnite.
[191:14.31]I'm sorry.
[191:22.67]Reasonable knockback.
[191:31.52]He has though.
[191:33.68]If I'm honest.
[191:34.28]He deserved it.
[191:43.87]You don't like Shrek?
[191:51.79]What's your problem with Shrek?
[191:56.58]I can't knock that out.
[192:04.01]Well, let's go.
[192:04.51]Samson versus the hunt.
[192:06.99]Alright, no more fucking around.
[192:13.66]Okay, good, good, good, good, good, good, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[192:23.90]Dog food.
[192:25.17]HP up.
[192:27.21]Move.
[192:35.90]Wasn't there a whole thing where people thought Peter Griffin was gonna be in Fortnite and it was a huge deal?
[192:40.20]What ever happened with that?
[192:51.13]Yeah, people on Twitter, it was like trending on Twitter that Peter Griffin was gonna be in Fortnite.
[193:07.38]I'm not making this up, I swear to God.
[193:14.63]Are we on the same planet here?
[193:16.32]That was a huge thing people were talking about.
[193:29.99]I feel like with Family Guy, I feel like... Is the... Is the tide moving on Family Guy?
[193:35.82]Like, especially Peter Griffin?
[193:38.24]I think we brought this up briefly before.
[193:40.12]But everybody... Family Guy came out.
[193:42.54]Everybody thought it was really funny.
[193:44.60]It got canceled.
[193:45.38]People begged to have it brought back.
[193:47.18]They brought it back.
[193:48.49]It was around for way too long.
[193:50.17]It became, like, really sort of... trying too hard and unfunny like-
[193:54.49]And then everybody knew that, started talking shit about Family Guy and then all of a sudden, like the last few years, Peter Griffin is now like funny.
[194:01.49]Not Peter Griffin in Family Guy. Peter Griffin just the guy is funny. Not Peter Griffin Family Guy Peter Griffin.
[194:11.00]Did it flip? Is it- it's ironic? Okay.
[194:22.63]Like the people that think Peter Griffin is funny right now, they don't watch Family Guy.
[194:27.55]They just think that Peter Griffin going like, holy crap Lois, I gotta get out of here.
[194:31.21]And it's like a meme, right?
[194:36.65]Why did I take that?
[194:37.35]I don't know, because it's cool.
[194:48.04]Holy crap, Lois.
[194:50.50]It's funny because he's not funny.
[194:55.60]Oh, okay.
[194:55.92]I get it.
[194:58.36]No, I genuinely think that Peter Griffin is funny, but Family Guy is bad.
[195:01.21]Okay, well that's some more data we have now.
[195:02.83]I wonder how many of you there are.
[195:21.26]I only laugh at Family Guy, not with Family Guy.
[195:30.25]I think this is a good combo with the orbiting tears.
[195:32.75]Or if I just would stop speaking.
[195:34.51]I would rather have Peter Griffin and Smash Brothers.
[195:57.41]I'm not picking that thing up.
[195:59.05]I'm getting this.
[195:59.51]Oh.
[196:00.75]Oh well.
[196:13.73]What a stupid car to get hurt for.
[196:18.60]Who has fallen further from grace?
[196:19.94]Family Guy, Simpsons, or South Park?
[196:24.12]Um, I don't know.
[196:26.62]I don't think it's South Park.
[196:30.46]It's probably The Simpsons.
[196:39.55]Yeah, it probably is The Simpsons.
[196:44.43]I'm in trouble now.
[196:45.21]Did I already check this wall?
[196:46.93]I'm in trouble.
[196:48.02]Alright, I have to pay attention.
[196:50.06]No talking about Simpsons and shit.
[196:51.26]Here we go.
[197:11.89]Box of stuff.
[197:12.63]Again.
[197:18.02]Paralysis.
[197:22.60]Yeah, I don't... I don't know if The Simpsons is particularly a worse show than the other two.
[197:31.09]But it feels like... Is it weird for me to say that canceling The Simpsons...
[197:37.93]It's just like, you can't.
[197:40.15]It has to be on TV.
[197:42.67]If The Simpsons is off of television, an old god's going to rise up from the fucking Earth's crust and kill us all.
[197:47.20]That has to be why.
[197:48.42]Has it been 30-something years?
[197:53.66]I'm going to keep the poop.
[198:07.34]There must always be a Simpsons.
[198:09.34]It must always be a lich king.
[198:21.00]And honestly I can't- I can't even speak very much to what I'm even saying.
[198:27.00]Oh The Simpsons isn't good anymore.
[198:29.00]I feel like all of us say that, but when was the last time you watched an episode of The Simpsons?
[198:34.84]I think all of us just assume The Simpsons is bad.
[198:37.44]And none of us have watched the show.
[198:39.12]Does any- nobody- I don't think anyone watches the show.
[198:42.15]They just air.
[198:42.69]I don't think people actually watch the show.
[198:46.47]It just airs.
[198:47.27]And everyone just goes, I don't think The Simpsons is good anymore.
[198:55.66]I don't- who's catching brand new episodes of The Simpsons when they go on Fox?
[198:59.54]Oh, it's on Fox.
[199:00.26]The Simpsons.
[199:01.36]It's not on Netflix or anything.
[199:03.69]It's on fucking old ass like cable TV.
[199:06.73]And how many people have that still?
[199:10.61]It's not on like Hulu, is it?
[199:11.91]Is it on Hulu?
[199:19.84]Are new episodes airing on Hulu though?
[199:22.78]They might have seasons, but are new episodes airing somewhere?
[199:25.68]Like on a week-to-week basis?
[199:27.78]It's on Disney+.
[199:28.36]Why?
[199:33.13]on Disney Plus, but it's a week-to-week basis.
[199:35.19]The newest episode is about Homer learning the floss.
[199:47.26]Okay, yeah, but like they can't... I get what people say here, where it's like, oh my god, it's about Homer like doing the floss in Fortnite.
[199:54.92]They can't just have every episode about him working at like a nuclear power plant.
[199:59.60]And like him reading newspapers and shit.
[200:02.68]And strangling bark.
[200:06.22]They have to have some type of... They've got to do something.
[200:09.58]It can't just be the same thing every time.
[200:18.74]Why not?
[200:19.24]Because it's been on for 30 years.
[200:20.62]This was a horrible idea, by the way, to take this.
[200:26.95]You guys are right.
[200:27.47]Which is why they should just take it off.
[200:39.67]They have to end it soon.
[200:43.75]Well, they've already broken the seven-year rule.
[200:48.11]It's been broken.
[200:49.51]Any show that is on the air for longer than seven seasons is not good anymore as of the eighth season.
[200:56.77]Every time.
[201:01.54]It is the ultimate Seinfeld rule.
[201:04.86]When a show goes past seven years, it's not as good anymore.
[201:14.50]Now, there are some exceptions.
[201:15.96]There are.
[201:16.98]There are some exceptions.
[201:21.38]But in a 95% of the time scenario, more than 7 plus years of a TV show, it starts to get a little tiring.
[201:33.85]What about Always Sunny?
[201:34.77]Yeah, but I said there were exceptions.
[201:35.83]That's like a god show.
[201:39.39]How many years have I been on?
[201:40.41]Yup.
[201:40.73]Mm-hmm.
[201:41.49]Okay.
[201:43.73]This is season, this is season 10 of Jerma985.
[201:47.07]Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not fair.
[201:50.36]I would say this is season like six, really.
[201:53.62]Season five, maybe.
[201:55.76]Because when I was on YouTube, I did my first like two years, a year or two on YouTube.
[202:00.70]I was like experimenting with stuff, trying to like see what I wanted to do.
[202:04.22]Like the real Jerma985, the streamer guy, the YouTuber guy, was like 2012, 2013.
[202:12.40]I was making pilots for a year and a half.
[202:16.64]This is year, like, six?
[202:18.42]Next year, we'll see if you guys still think this show's any good.
[202:27.49]The seasons are arcs.
[202:28.63]This is currently arc number four.
[202:31.29]Yeah, I mean, that sounds kind of accurate.
[202:44.21]I feel the same way about a lot of movie franchises too.
[202:47.13]And hear me out here.
[202:49.23]Once a show or a movie gets to be a point where it's like more than 10, 20 plus years going, all the actors feel like they are doing parodies and impressions of themselves.
[203:04.75]It's not the character, it's like the actor doing the impression of the character.
[203:11.02]Perfect example is like when Johnny Depp was in the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
[203:14.80]I saw it and it was like, this is not Captain Jack Sparrow.
[203:18.72]This is Johnny Depp in a costume doing Captain Jack Sparrow.
[203:28.79]Once you cross a certain amount of time and a certain amount of, I guess, age for actors and stuff, it's just like, it's almost, it becomes like a parody of itself.
[203:36.35]And I can't suspend my disbelief anymore.
[203:46.07]Johnny Depp in a costume.
[203:47.37]Fucking Jack Sparrow?
[203:50.18]Wait, was that what I said?
[203:54.56]What did I say?
[203:55.22]What did I say?
[203:58.71]That's not what I said, right?
[203:59.81]Is that how I worded it?
[204:03.83]How did I say it?
[204:14.59]phrasing?
[204:14.93]I don't think I said it like that, though.
[204:22.06]Ow!
[204:22.28]This is why you can tell I don't look at the screen.
[204:25.40]There's your proof that I sometimes just don't even look at the screen.
[204:27.82]I'm looking at you.
[204:29.22]And this is the worst item in the game.
[204:30.75]Did they buff it?
[204:32.91]Did they buff the worst active item in the game?
[204:40.89]They did, really.
[204:43.35]Is it better now?
[204:49.72]Holy shit.
[204:52.74]That's now the best item in the game.
[204:55.72]Are you kidding me?
[204:58.84]That thing was so awful before this game.
[205:04.37]Oh, yep.
[205:05.69]Thank you.
[205:14.13]I can't get this stuff.
[205:14.83]I don't want the robes.
[205:16.71]No, I have one heart.
[205:19.17]You have too much confidence in my ability.
[205:30.58]You didn't take the robes.
[205:31.64]No, I don't want it.
[205:33.22]Robes give black hearts.
[205:34.18]Yeah, and they never come back.
[205:35.82]And I'm going to lose them.
[205:36.60]You know me.
[205:37.39]You've watched me play games before.
[205:38.59]I'm not going to have three black hearts forever.
[205:40.49]They're going to go away.
[205:51.23]I need tears up.
[205:52.31]That would solve every one of my problems right here.
[205:53.93]How have the runs been?
[206:00.83]Oh, the last one was alright.
[206:02.66]The save file does not have... I haven't beaten the hush three times on the save file, so... Probably not gonna do that, so I'm probably gonna get a new save file.
[206:10.98]I'm probably gonna talk like this, I guess, for some reason.
[206:23.71]What does putting out the fires do?
[206:24.75]The fires, sometimes a coin will be in them.
[206:27.66]Sometimes.
[206:36.76]Take a couple hits.
[206:37.98]Not from the big guy, because that's a full heart.
[206:39.54]Those are not Isaac pros like me.
[206:42.51]Probably didn't know that.
[206:44.13]If a champion hits you, it is one full heart, not half a heart.
[206:48.22]It's just, it's absolute dog shit game design.
[206:51.71]Dog, it's awful fucking video game design.
[206:53.91]I'm just kidding.
[206:57.15]It's pretty good.
[206:57.79]It's actually pretty good design if you think about it.
[207:01.03]He's being so angry at the game.
[207:09.22]Facecam.
[207:09.82]No, I don't need clothes on.
[207:11.24]I never do.
[207:11.70]I don't think I'm ever going to kill these guys.
[207:30.02]It's the equivalent of hitting a foul ball every pitch.
[207:57.68]Can something happen please?
[208:10.79]Nice.
[208:13.79]Please restart.
[208:14.69]No, it's not over yet.
[208:15.65]If I get tears up and damage up, I can just be a spam mobile.
[208:20.18]And I should be fine.
[208:21.68]Ooh.
[208:37.47]Mmm.
[208:42.15]I want the damage from Samson.
[208:43.35]Alright, no more.
[208:45.47]No.
[208:46.23]Dollar.
[208:47.23]Oh, no.
[208:47.57]Why would a dollar be in here?
[208:48.43]Portable blood.
[208:49.29]Oh.
[208:49.51]Okay.
[208:53.89]Give me something.
[209:02.29]Come on.
[209:02.63]You can do better than that.
[209:03.25]I know you can.
[209:08.67]No.
[209:09.03]Come on.
[209:09.86]Come on.
[209:10.80]One more.
[209:16.61]I had the two diamonds the whole time.
[209:26.14]Continuum.
[209:27.14]Transcendent Tears.
[209:30.76]Wait, don't these go through walls?
[209:32.98]Oh, boy.
[209:33.66]If I get range and tears up, this would actually be really good.
[209:41.16]I just need a bunch of ran- and I need, uh, the Ouija board.
[209:43.36]I need spectral tears, and tears up, and then range.
[209:47.38]This would be awesome.
[209:55.98]Let me go back up here.
[209:58.14]Oof.
[210:01.12]Oof.
[210:03.04]Oof.
[210:03.58]Oof.
[210:11.76]Oh, Mr. Me has appeared in the basement.
[210:25.58]In The Simpsons, that's the first boss from The Simpsons game.
[210:28.16]The guy with the underwear.
[210:31.33]That just popped in again.
[210:36.47]Simpsons arcade game to beat him up.
[210:39.37]When you go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, and his pants go down, he goes, I already did show it a long time ago.
[211:01.24]Punch HP up.
[211:03.78]Oh, two of diamonds.
[211:05.14]Use it.
[211:07.23]Blood, blood bag.
[211:08.85]No.
[211:10.39]Let's kill this guy.
[211:13.37]That was horrible order.
[211:14.37]I know it was, but look.
[211:19.71]I'm not in this to be the best.
[211:21.09]I'm in this to be the greatest.
[211:23.82]I'm different.
[211:46.76]Alright, I forgot I had to talk.
[211:48.28]So, um... What's your favorite, uh... What kind of latte?
[211:54.95]Mine is... A oat milk.
[211:59.27]A little bit of mocha.
[212:03.71]And what's yours?
[212:04.67]I don't know.
[212:09.41]Mom's key.
[212:10.11]Better chest loot and +2 keys.
[212:12.09]It was worth it.
[212:12.55]Did I donate to, like...
[212:19.97]Soy milk.
[212:20.53]I didn't say soy milk.
[212:21.55]I said oat milk.
[212:23.97]I said oat milk.
[212:26.52]Oat.
[212:27.42]O-A-T, not S-O-Y.
[212:30.98]Oat.
[212:32.02]Open your ears.
[212:34.04]Open up your ears.
[212:35.48]For once.
[212:36.66]Oat.
[212:37.94]God.
[212:40.47]I think, honest to God.
[212:44.69]Oat.
[212:57.21]Rude.
[212:59.69]Yeah, whatever.
[213:02.89]Welcome to the next arc.
[213:04.31]We're in season five now.
[213:06.91]Rude.
[213:07.49]Mean.
[213:07.89]Jerma.
[213:09.05]Oh, no.
[213:09.49]Nobody thought... Nobody wanted to get... Nobody thought this was going to happen.
[213:14.25]Rude.
[213:14.73]Mean.
[213:15.79]Angry.
[213:16.15]Pissed off.
[213:16.83]Rude.
[213:17.09]Jerma.
[213:19.53]Oh, fuck.
[213:20.83]How do we...
[213:28.15]That actually might be one of the better space bar items now.
[213:32.58]Booster pack.
[213:36.16]Diamonds.
[213:37.92]Oh my god, diamonds again.
[213:39.02]Two clubs.
[213:43.87]Lovers.
[213:44.21]It's hearts.
[213:45.33]Hangman.
[213:45.77]I'll take this one.
[213:46.37]Did I miss anything else?
[213:48.73]Can I spend any more money anywhere?
[213:51.01]I didn't see the... I'll go back to the shop.
[213:55.76]Roto Beast Booster Packs.
[214:05.05]I'll donate now.
[214:07.07]Does 500 give you anything?
[214:07.85]Broke it.
[214:22.68]Cool.
[214:22.92]Alright, let's go.
[214:23.50]Okay.
[214:38.32]I like the part of the stream where Jerma says, Okay, it's really funny.
[214:43.51]My favorite part.
[214:45.95]I always wait for it.
[214:55.39]Mine too.
[215:03.96]They suss.
[215:09.98]Oh, no, he's a one-trick pony.
[215:12.80]He just says, like, weird sounds.
[215:18.61]Really?
[215:19.93]Wait, there's double the stuff in chests now.
[215:27.31]I'll take the damage.
[215:27.93]I got plenty of hearts.
[215:37.66]No more.
[215:50.44]Did I take the hearts?
[215:57.78]No, no.
[216:00.74]I was looking at chat again.
[216:05.18]Quick, quick.
[216:06.42]Emergency.
[216:07.24]We need an emergency.
[216:08.51]Doy, doy, doy.
[216:10.01]Chat is getting bored.
[216:11.71]Emergency.
[216:12.47]Doy, doy, doy.
[216:19.19]Did you hear that?
[216:19.61]I'm just like... This makes this even shittier.
[216:29.04]This just kind of gives me a headache.
[216:39.36]This is definitely Season 8.
[216:42.90]Yeah.
[216:44.08]Uh-oh, we're in Season 8 territory, boys and girls.
[217:01.80]Hey, but hold on a minute.
[217:04.04]We had a really bad season in the middle of the show.
[217:06.89]And then the show got better later.
[217:08.83]I will be at a net zero here for these bombs.
[217:13.17]That was not smart.
[217:25.83]No, I don't want bad trip.
[217:32.26]There we go.
[217:32.72]Finally.
[217:33.15]More.
[217:42.75]Nice.
[217:45.76]Starting to come together.
[217:48.62]More.
[218:11.77]Time to spend some money.
[218:13.49]I don't know what that is, but I'm going to get it.
[218:15.66]Mama Mega.
[218:19.02]What does Mama Mega do?
[218:28.32]I don't really want to get rid of the heaven beam.
[218:34.31]Use it.
[218:34.59]I don't want to use it right now.
[218:37.99]Is that the boss?
[218:39.45]And I'll pick up the other thing?
[218:46.47]On the next floor.
[218:53.20]Come on, dick.
[218:55.28]Relax.
[218:58.22]Oh, no.
[218:59.48]Is that epic hack or is that chemical peel?
[219:03.02]If it's epic hack, this whole thing's over.
[219:06.78]Okay.
[219:11.69]Chemical peel is damage up for one eye, right?
[219:33.68]Open.
[219:35.32]Watch out.
[219:35.80]Troll bomb.
[219:41.69]Open.
[219:50.27]Where's the boss?
[219:51.65]Somewhere down here.
[219:54.47]Ice room.
[219:58.81]Bounce over here.
[219:59.27]Come on.
[219:59.55]Get killed by the spikes.
[220:07.59]There was another game sound effect that I was thinking of the other day.
[220:09.93]I was trying to imitate it, but maybe I got it wrong.
[220:15.15]You guys remember the game Joe and Mac?
[220:19.39]Where you fight the dinosaurs?
[220:21.55]You could side-scrolling beat them up with two players.
[220:25.61]They were the cavemen.
[220:26.76]When you hit the cavemen with a club, you had a melee weapon for a club.
[220:30.08]It would make this sound.
[220:31.94]And it was like...
[220:37.62]Did I get it right?
[220:40.06]What does five do?
[220:43.72]Rerolls the whole floor.
[220:44.50]I don't think I want that.
[220:47.76]Wait, if I got all the items, wouldn't that be just free stuff?
[220:53.29]Yeah, I'm going to kill the boss.
[220:54.47]Yeah, let's get free stuff.
[220:55.35]Let's go.
[221:10.21]Yeah, I'm not going to pick it up until... I'm going to use the bomb on this boss.
[221:14.86]I'm assuming it's just a gigantic explosion.
[221:20.44]Tinted rock, where?
[221:27.31]Where do you see a tinted rock?
[221:30.85]Wait, save the bomb for hush.
[221:32.31]I don't think I'm going to get to hush at this point.
[221:36.09]Do it on a fresh floor.
[221:38.11]Then I lose my...
[221:41.24]Don't use bomb, you idiot.
[221:43.26]I don't even know what it does.
[221:44.15]This wouldn't kill Hush.
[221:57.67]It doesn't do that much damage.
[221:59.71]Just use it on a new floor, but then I'd lose my feather.
[222:06.62]Just use it now.
[222:14.24]opens up hush it does damage to every enemy in every room on the floor please Jerma tinted rock outside the shop fish moly okay wait
[222:44.88]So are we ditching the feather and I'm going to use this after Mom's Foot to make sure I can get to Hush and die to him and lose?
[222:49.56]Because this build is absolutely not a Hush killer.
[222:53.12]It is not a Hush killer at all.
[222:54.78]It is not.
[222:57.66]Where?
[222:57.87]Where's this Tinted Rock?
[223:04.45]Outside this shop.
[223:23.13]It's hard to see.
[223:25.47]It's hard to see.
[223:26.19]Shut up.
[223:26.81]Shut up.
[223:27.23]It's hard to see.
[223:27.76]Shut up.
[223:32.10]Toxic.
[223:33.58]Season 7 of Turbo 985.
[223:36.10]Shut the fuck up, you fucking idiot.
[223:40.29]What do you even know?
[223:42.09]You thought he was a nice guy.
[223:44.17]No, no, no.
[223:45.17]Not anymore.
[223:47.65]The dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard anybody say.
[223:50.17]This stupid fucking asshole.
[223:54.23]Join us for our 12 episode series.
[224:00.86]Season 5.
[224:02.94]Fucking moron.
[224:03.86]Ban that guy and fucking don't.
[224:05.28]Ban his IP.
[224:05.92]Fucking stupid piece of shit.
[224:11.30]What is this one?
[224:30.92]Did I go get the- eh, whatever.
[224:35.50]Monstro 2?
[224:46.03]I got a bingo?
[225:01.72]Bingo, what are you talking about?
[225:03.78]Who's playing bingo?
[225:07.34]Oh no, it's Krampus.
[225:08.34]Give me the coal.
[225:12.84]Coal is gonna be awesome.
[225:15.83]All you non-believers.
[225:18.09]Oh, that's so unfortunate.
[225:20.97]That actually sucks.
[225:25.31]Coal would be so good with this.
[225:29.62]That sucks.
[225:37.78]Oh, well.
[225:39.22]Ah, so I'm just not going to take the feather.
[225:40.98]I'm going to use the bomb.
[225:42.41]Whatever.
[225:42.63]I'll try it.
[225:43.03]Who cares?
[225:45.23]No, I'm not.
[225:45.59]I'm going to reroll the floor.
[225:46.39]Get the feather.
[226:02.42]Reroll.
[226:02.74]That was a great item, Jerma.
[226:03.66]They buffed it.
[226:05.69]So I have three really good actives then.
[226:07.59]I feel like the bomb is just a gimmick.
[226:08.97]I don't want it.
[226:10.07]I don't care what it does.
[226:11.43]I don't care if it's going to show me hush.
[226:12.61]I don't even want it.
[226:13.29]It's a gimmick.
[226:15.07]Give me the feather.
[226:17.81]Or no, is Krampus' head even better than it was before?
[226:20.57]It's a gimmick.
[226:23.91]I don't want it.
[226:35.05]I'm going to keep the feather.
[226:39.21]What the hell?
[226:44.62]Oh, cool.
[226:46.36]Whoa.
[226:47.98]Free money.
[226:49.12]The ATM exploded.
[226:59.34]Whoa.
[227:00.52]Just go in every single room.
[227:02.92]Will this open up the secret rooms?
[227:06.39]It does.
[227:06.81]Cool.
[227:08.59]Alright.
[227:13.12]50% off.
[227:15.58]And Lazy Worm.
[227:21.40]This is better.
[227:21.88]Just give me tears up and this is saved.
[227:38.51]Ow.
[227:47.28]It's time for you to rest.
[227:53.72]It's time to rest?
[227:58.57]Flat file, no more spikes.
[228:01.87]No, I don't care.
[228:03.63]That's kind of cool, but I want this low.
[228:09.80]Super secret room.
[228:15.75]Ooh, diamonds.
[228:16.75]Oh, what's a double of 90?
[228:17.59]Oh, okay.
[228:18.43]Thanks.
[228:28.45]Horrible super secret room if I've ever seen one.
[228:30.11]Okay, we've done all those.
[228:40.68]Why am I exploding every single room?
[228:42.66]Because there could be items in a bunch of these rocks and secret walls and secret rooms.
[228:48.47]And I'm able to do this and walk around like this and move like this.
[228:51.31]I don't need to do every single one of them, but, you know, enough of them.
[228:59.04]Nope.
[229:08.70]That was annoying.
[229:11.34]The Jerma show used to be so good Yeah, now he's just like out there it's like season eight season nine it was like funny for a while But yeah, just like I don't know.
[229:26.44]I just like feel like he's doing kind of a parody of himself He's doing like the Goku voice
[229:33.55]Like, I remember when he did that and it was funny, but now he's, like, doing it all the time.
[229:36.73]And it's like he's using it as a way to kind of crutch or something for comedic purposes.
[229:40.79]I don't know.
[229:51.06]He's doing it.
[229:55.90]Oh, get off me.
[230:01.13]The hermit.
[230:03.27]Yep.
[230:03.93]Ooh, everything is free.
[230:06.65]Don't take that, right?
[230:07.91]No, that thing sucks.
[230:13.09]I remember that thing is horrible.
[230:14.63]If you take damage, you teleport out of the room.
[230:17.97]Right?
[230:25.09]That's not what this one is.
[230:25.97]It recharges an item on hit.
[230:30.23]Okay.
[230:30.71]Alright, alright, alright.
[230:32.75]I thought this was the thing that when you take damage, you teleport out.
[230:34.93]That's the worst item probably in the whole game.
[230:45.62]That's the cursed eye.
[230:46.48]Oh, what is this?
[230:48.54]Dead eye.
[230:49.56]Accuracy brings power.
[230:51.96]That's not gonna happen.
[231:02.77]This is the most inaccurate you can probably be.
[231:07.30]Although it lasts... I don't know.
[231:10.76]I think it's working.
[231:18.59]It looks really cool though.
[231:21.37]I don't want the monkey paw.
[231:34.47]Get in there.
[231:35.69]I need tears up so bad.
[231:37.39]This looks awesome.
[231:38.51]What a cool looking build.
[231:42.21]What happened to that?
[231:42.95]Why did that hit me?
[231:44.49]It's weird.
[231:51.08]I forget to use the active.
[231:52.72]Right, right, right.
[231:53.14]Yeah.
[231:53.86]I'm holding on to it because I'm scared I'm not going to have it for the boss.
[232:04.33]You got to be concentrated or otherwise it's not very good.
[232:06.25]I'm going to burp.
[232:07.63]Hopefully not directly into your face.
[232:25.28]How many hours do we have in the game?
[232:26.84]Well, in total, probably five or six hundred.
[232:33.72]But, there's a big but here.
[232:37.48]It's like 500 or 600 hours.
[232:39.97]The problem is, oh, this is actually kind of,
[232:48.22]The problem is, it's like 500 or 600 hours over the course of almost 10 years.
[232:54.67]So I play the game for a few months, and then I stop playing for a year.
[232:59.08]So then I forget every single thing that's in the game, and I start over again.
[233:03.88]I've done that for the last probably seven straight years.
[233:13.04]I have restarted save files across different consoles.
[233:17.16]I have a file on my Switch right now.
[233:20.76]I've played a ton of Isaac on Switch.
[233:23.78]I have almost all the unlockables, but this is not for Switch yet.
[233:27.14]I would have played it on the Switch and been ready to go.
[233:30.87]But I'm seeing a lot of stuff I didn't see in the other one that I've played usually.
[233:36.99]But yeah.
[233:39.29]This is a big butt.
[233:42.15]How are you so bad at the game?
[233:45.27]Um... I don't know.
[233:48.07]Like I just told you, I pick up the game and I play it for like a week or two and then I don't play it for like a year or two and then I start over again.
[234:00.92]I'm like fresh starting the game again for the first time.
[234:06.71]It's all muscle memory and repetition, guys.
[234:09.15]If you...
[234:12.09]If I had played Isaac for like a year straight, I'm sure I'd be phenomenal.
[234:18.87]Why did I go in here?
[234:21.52]I have to.
[234:21.96]I really don't like that room.
[234:31.18]Alright, watch the health here.
[234:42.70]Um, no, all jokes aside, what's the best thing you've ever seen me do in a video game?
[234:56.25]No messing around, no like, oh yeah, when you, uh, jevel, first try.
[235:00.34]What opportunity have you ever seen where I did something that was unbelievable?
[235:06.68]What was it?
[235:11.40]How many of those have I had?
[235:15.38]It was probably Jevil.
[235:16.53]It honestly, unironically was Jevil.
[235:25.56]What the fuck?
[235:36.27]Laying through Simpsons hit and run?
[235:37.57]I don't think so.
[235:48.87]Okay, let's keep moving this way.
[235:52.27]It was beating Jump King?
[235:55.93]I feel like that was not... That game was a horrible pain in the ass.
[236:01.19]Right?
[236:02.23]But I don't know if that sits up there with, oh my god, that was the best thing ever.
[236:08.71]A lot of people beat Jump King.
[236:11.15]Not a lot of people beat Jevil first try.
[236:12.75]I know you did.
[236:14.57]But a bunch of other people didn't.
[236:21.90]Oh.
[236:23.74]Friend zone.
[236:24.44]Friendly fly.
[236:26.92]Another orbit.
[236:27.45]That's... Okay.
[236:32.53]That's a Ouija board, isn't it?
[236:34.59]It's the Ouija board.
[236:35.51]That's it.
[236:38.19]I got spectral tears.
[236:39.25]They're going to go through everything.
[236:55.01]Wait, spectral does not go through.
[236:56.76]That's piercing.
[236:57.96]I got that wrong.
[237:02.44]Oh, that's right.
[237:03.10]They don't phase through.
[237:04.38]It's not piercing.
[237:06.66]Shit, I thought it was.
[237:14.81]I already had spectral.
[237:16.59]God damn it.
[237:18.31]I thought that spectral tears meant that they pass phase through.
[237:22.00]It's piercing.
[237:22.68]Oh, yeah.
[237:25.98]The color is still good, but it's... Alright, let's go.
[237:34.01]Oh, no.
[237:40.79]Guppy's head?
[237:41.47]This counts that I picked it up, right?
[237:46.58]I just have to pick it up.
[237:49.68]From my understanding.
[237:56.55]Guppy, yes.
[237:57.45]I call this guy the Guppy Cruncher.
[237:59.73]That's better.
[238:09.58]I don't think it's not... I like the concentrated damage.
[238:17.36]Reap creep?
[238:20.68]Oh my god!
[238:40.33]Somebody said, are you gonna watch the Irishman on stream?
[238:46.59]No.
[238:53.63]Why would I watch the Irishman on stream?
[238:58.39]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[238:59.61]Let's have them hit over and over.
[239:08.36]You're good.
[239:20.44]Are you going to play Path of Exile?
[239:23.42]No, I can't play Path of Exile.
[239:25.92]I have one problem with it.
[239:27.14]It's a major problem I can't overlook.
[239:30.34]The game could be a 10 out of 10 game.
[239:32.26]And it could be my favorite video game ever made.
[239:35.09]Gameplay wise.
[239:35.71]I don't like the camera.
[239:39.25]I wish I could zoom the camera out another 20-30%.
[239:41.33]I don't like the angle of the camera and I don't like how close it is.
[239:47.53]Even at max zoom, it's not far enough.
[239:50.41]It's the only thing that's keeping me back from playing the game.
[239:52.52]And I've tried to play it more than twice.
[239:54.38]So I'm not just bullshitting you here.
[239:58.06]I've tried to play... What is fucking hitting me?
[240:00.96]Can anyone... What the hell just happened to me?
[240:03.67]What happened?
[240:06.11]What was that?
[240:18.63]Gemini.
[240:19.07]I need more stuff to look at on the screen.
[240:22.21]Okay.
[240:23.71]Um, I got to be really careful.
[240:24.93]Path of Exile 2 is going to improve zoom.
[240:40.70]Oh, God.
[240:43.16]Oh, fuck.
[241:03.34]Arts.
[241:08.10]Why did I do that?
[241:11.08]What did that accomplish?
[241:12.12]I didn't even look for the secret room.
[241:24.82]I'm so scared.
[241:31.43]Get the fuck away from me.
[241:34.79]Health.
[241:37.97]Drink Diablo sauce on stream.
[241:41.98]Oh, no.
[241:43.32]It's over.
[241:46.13]No, it's over.
[241:47.59]It's over.
[241:50.15]I hate this place.
[242:06.99]Bomb the door.
[242:08.10]Oh, wait, what?
[242:13.12]Everything's fine.
[242:24.78]I thought I was far enough away.
[242:31.61]Finally, coins!
[242:39.48]Look at my hearts.
[242:40.62]Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.
[242:42.46]I'll sit here all day if I have to.
[242:46.32]Now.
[242:58.14]What was that?
[242:59.60]Come on.
[243:10.24]No!
[243:10.52]Get away from him!
[243:13.10]So many bombs.
[243:30.94]Parts.
[243:32.95]Give me hearts now.
[243:34.13]Give me hearts!
[243:35.55]Give me hearts.
[243:35.99]There we go.
[243:36.63]Give me a fucking heart now.
[243:38.57]Give me a heart.
[243:39.05]Yeah!
[243:39.53]Give me another one.
[243:41.31]Give me that heart right now.
[243:42.09]Give me another one.
[243:43.09]Give me another one!
[243:55.86]I will do this until I have full health.
[243:57.91]Watch me.
[244:01.29]Are little sisters afraid of you?
[244:04.36]Why is your little sister watching this stream?
[244:11.67]This shouldn't be happening right now.
[244:18.99]Does your little sister hate me now?
[244:22.29]I've got somebody here.
[244:24.99]Come on over here.
[244:25.61]Hello.
[244:30.51]It's me, Elmo.
[244:32.03]Hey, Elmo.
[244:32.93]What are you doing here?
[244:34.81]Well, I want to teach everybody some sharing and how to share your milk.
[244:42.94]Well, yeah, you should share.
[244:44.04]You should share your milk.
[244:45.52]You should share your toys.
[244:47.04]You should also share your toys with your brother and your friends and your sister.
[244:57.09]Thanks for showing up and telling everybody that, Elmo.
[245:00.37]No problem, Mr. Noodle.
[245:02.50]That's not me, I'm not Mr. Noodle.
[245:04.58]You fucking dumb puppet motherfucker.
[245:16.81]She's 24?
[245:17.81]I pressed the button accidentally.
[245:25.60]She's 24?
[245:25.92]Oh.
[245:39.93]Well, when you say my little sister's afraid of you, I think of like a little kid.
[245:46.06]Like a blanket going like, what is this wrong with this guy?
[245:53.42]My little sister's scared of you.
[246:00.35]Oh shit.
[246:01.69]Wait, what am I doing?
[246:03.09]I forgot.
[246:10.69]Oh, what happened to him?
[246:12.53]What?
[246:12.97]Okay, I am serious.
[246:14.67]I am not kidding.
[246:16.17]What happened to that guy in there?
[246:18.33]What happened to him?
[246:19.53]I don't know.
[246:20.83]Oh, you got that item.
[246:21.79]Right, yeah, okay.
[246:36.58]My little sister's scared of you.
[246:39.01]Let me do an Elmo impression.
[246:54.39]These new guys suck.
[247:02.03]These guys right here, they put out the little bugs.
[247:21.90]Yeah, why did I do like the fuck you Elmo motherfucker thing?
[247:25.24]Like, that wasn't funny.
[247:26.38]That was just like me being like the toxic screamer thing again.
[247:29.66]I don't know why I did that.
[247:31.82]Starting to lash out, aren't I?
[247:35.06]Of course.
[247:44.07]Oh my god, I'm so pissed that he's in here that I'm taking damage.
[247:47.31]Look at this.
[247:48.25]He's kicking the shit out of me.
[247:49.21]I'm so mad that he's here.
[248:16.83]I need health and I need stuff.
[248:24.05]Oh my god, the spider webs.
[248:29.61]Alright, well, it's his mom, right?
[248:48.05]Come on!
[248:48.53]Alright, we're good.
[249:08.97]Polaroid, again.
[249:09.95]56 minutes.
[249:14.42]Not 30 minutes!
[249:27.52]Keep gambling?
[249:28.18]You know, I could have, but I really just want to move on.
[249:32.86]What am I possibly going to get out of there?
[249:35.89]I have 40 bombs.
[249:36.89]I have 5 keys.
[249:37.63]I have tons of money.
[249:38.41]I mean, maybe spirit hearts?
[249:43.03]This is horrible.
[249:43.77]This room is terrible.
[249:46.30]I'm not going this way.
[249:57.71]Remember when I killed Mega Satan on stream and I had this thing that just blew up the screen every half second?
[250:02.13]That was really cool.
[250:03.93]You guys remember that season?
[250:05.65]That was a really cool episode of that season.
[250:10.30]Let's just do the thing that shows do where they just tell you to remember how cool the show was.
[250:13.54]Look how cool that was.
[250:27.38]This is the clip show season.
[250:29.58]These are new.
[250:30.36]What are these?
[250:31.04]Oh my god.
[250:38.89]What the fuck just happened?
[250:40.53]Look, I put the bomb and walked over and looked at Chad because I thought I was safe.
[250:57.40]99 coins!
[251:12.37]Oh no.
[251:24.56]Ugh.
[251:27.75]It's not over yet.
[251:28.51]Not yet.
[251:29.21]Almost.
[251:30.01]Now it is.
[251:30.35]I'm going to die.
[251:43.85]What is that?
[251:47.99]Flat penny?
[251:50.53]What's this?
[251:55.35]Not worth it.
[252:01.53]It's the part where the streamer pretends to not know how to play and lose a 56 minute run.
[252:07.65]Okay, okay, I'm fine.
[252:14.54]I'm fine.
[252:19.98]I'm probably gonna die here though because this stuff's all new and scary.
[252:36.63]And they made hard mode way harder.
[252:39.56]You didn't tell me that.
[252:40.32]When I was on the Steam store page.
[252:42.76]What the heck?
[252:44.14]Banana Crew.
[252:44.85]I mean, Drew Crew.
[252:46.65]Oh, I'm dead.
[253:24.58]The build was cool.
[253:38.87]Yeah, but it was never gonna work out.
[253:40.65]It was cool to look at.
[253:42.45]I needed more tears.
[253:44.25]I needed more damage.
[253:46.71]It was cool, and I need to...
[253:50.92]It was cool to look at though.
[253:51.86]Uh, slowing enemies down.
[253:55.56]Nice.
[253:55.94]Cool.
[253:57.96]I'm just going for it.
[253:58.50]Let's go.
[253:59.15]I'm getting to the hush and I'm going to beat hush right now.
[254:15.73]Oh.
[254:24.50]That's new.
[254:26.46]That's new.
[254:26.94]That bug isn't even in the first game.
[254:35.29]Estolence.
[254:45.17]Sounds like our real monsters.
[254:48.15]That sounds like just background music in our real monsters.
[254:55.23]That was weird.
[254:55.81]Alright, where's that?
[255:06.28]It's a candle.
[255:06.90]Don't want it.
[255:07.32]Hurry up.
[255:17.21]Smells like UpGamer in here.
[255:18.75]What's up, dude?
[255:19.13]How have you been?
[255:20.45]Hope you're doing well.
[255:21.77]It was, um... There it is.
[255:31.92]Hurry up.
[255:48.65]Don't bother with the secret room.
[255:49.57]Just move.
[255:51.63]I'll get there.
[255:52.35]I'll get there.
[255:52.85]Watch this.
[256:05.62]Nothing in here besides these little slugs.
[256:15.98]Not coming back down here for any reason.
[256:27.12]You're not beating the hush yet.
[256:28.82]I don't think I have on this save file.
[256:32.04]Maybe once.
[256:33.14]You can check, right?
[256:40.80]Which is the hutch?
[256:41.46]It's like the three dots, right?
[256:44.54]Oh, that's delirium.
[256:46.44]Joker card.
[256:46.98]Hell yeah.
[256:50.04]Bat protector.
[256:50.90]That's pretty good.
[257:03.31]Are you the Joker now?
[257:14.17]Give me this.
[257:16.23]Stars is item room.
[257:17.03]Don't want it.
[257:25.32]You still have a 100% devil deal chance.
[257:27.28]That's right.
[257:31.96]Just do the Joker now?
[257:32.88]It can take me to that weird error room, right?
[257:35.32]I want to remember it.
[257:56.02]save it for caves one okay I'm gonna hold on to the joker
[258:25.06]Does the fat guy do anything besides just block damage?
[258:30.30]Or is it just a huge fat guy?
[258:36.67]It blocks and does a little damage.
[258:37.97]Okay, cool.
[258:40.43]I gotta try to get to Hush.
[258:45.21]Oh, I've definitely beaten Hush.
[258:46.51]I know I have.
[258:49.03]At least a few times.
[258:51.77]On this file, I think.
[258:58.15]Bar of Soap.
[258:59.31]Tears and shots beat up.
[259:00.47]Alright, nice.
[259:00.93]Wait, I don't want to leave just yet.
[259:01.93]Should I just go?
[259:02.41]I gotta go.
[259:03.68]I gotta go.
[259:04.02]We gotta move.
[259:12.08]Use the Joker now.
[259:22.21]Use it now?
[259:29.13]Oh, that's Dark Bomb.
[259:30.15]That guy's awesome.
[259:30.75]They nerfed him?
[259:41.69]What do you mean they nerfed him?
[259:43.83]Wow.
[259:46.07]Hey, he's shitty now?
[259:47.25]No, he's not.
[259:48.59]What did they do?
[259:49.21]It was good like three years ago.
[259:57.42]Really?
[260:04.79]He sucks now.
[260:11.74]Counterfeit penny.
[260:12.52]Wealth of wealth.
[260:13.16]I'll keep it.
[260:15.46]I'm gonna go down.
[260:17.70]Drops lots of stuff now instead of soul hearts.
[260:19.92]Oh.
[260:22.84]Whatever.
[260:28.33]I remember a really cool run was if you had Little Chad and Dark Bum.
[260:32.09]It was just never-ending soul hearts.
[260:33.95]It was awesome.
[260:34.43]Why did I go in this room?
[260:42.35]Still a 40% chance for a Blackheart.
[260:44.11]Okay.
[260:47.11]I am not dealing with this right now.
[260:59.26]LM, please.
[261:03.79]Huge, huge room.
[261:06.00]Get double items, though.
[261:10.91]That's good.
[261:24.06]So, let's talk about something really quickly.
[261:26.52]On the next stream... So, remember, we're trying this new thing here.
[261:32.11]I am going to play... I'm going to try to get The Sims 1 ready for next week.
[261:39.26]If you... I'm going to say it one more time.
[261:40.76]I'm going to say it for the third time just to make sure everyone hears it.
[261:44.58]Uh...
[261:47.48]I'm going to be streaming at the same point at the same time on the same day.
[261:54.41]Once a week with an option for a second day in a row.
[261:57.45]That's sort of how it's going to be for a while.
[262:00.67]Even maybe even long term.
[262:02.51]If you missed out with all the updates.
[262:05.71]But it will be on schedule.
[262:07.99]Scheduled streams are coming back.
[262:09.95]No longer just up in the air randomly in the afternoon.
[262:11.98]Pacific.
[262:14.02]You will know exactly, precisely every time when the stream is going to happen.
[262:17.52]And this is kind of weird.
[262:18.42]Hold on.
[262:25.04]Try Pac-Man 99.
[262:26.16]Yeah, that actually looks awesome.
[262:27.90]Two bombs to blow that up, right?
[262:51.15]And I will have a lot more information about Grotto Beasts over the next couple of streams.
[262:56.97]You'll hear me talk way more about it.
[262:59.96]Just wanted to make sure you know that that's a real thing.
[263:03.46]Oh god, what does this do?
[263:11.03]This recharges.
[263:11.83]You can blow the bottom up, right?
[263:21.97]Oh, fuck.
[263:30.42]I thought it took you to that room with the item.
[263:36.12]I thought it took you down that ladder with the- there's an item at the bottom.
[263:45.65]It's only if there's a ladder on it.
[263:50.14]The game's like, okay, Binding of Isaac may as well be a physics textbook by now, okay?
[263:55.20]There's like a thousand items.
[263:56.92]There's like 400 room combinations.
[264:00.14]I'm sorry.
[264:11.43]Shit.
[264:12.07]I just deleted like four items.
[264:13.93]This is a dead run now.
[264:15.77]Fuck.
[264:17.17]I'm so mad right now.
[264:18.61]Oh.
[264:28.31]I want to do greed mode with somebody.
[264:35.48]I love greed mode.
[264:36.08]It's like my favorite.
[264:38.88]Range and luck up.
[264:44.19]Now, I'm used to, when I was playing on the Switch, greedier mode.
[264:48.57]So this should be easier for me, considering the last time I played this, it was greedier, greedier, only greedier.
[264:57.69]So I should be okay here.
[265:07.75]When's the Catboy stream?
[265:08.98]Now that is a great question.
[265:11.32]One that I will refuse to answer.
[265:13.42]But I will say it was a very nice question.
[265:16.38]And I will move on as if you never asked it.
[265:42.59]be here uh but in all seriousness you'll see it at some point soon that's probably the next quote more elaborate stream that you'll see it's probably the next one oh my god you get so many more coins in the regular greed mode it's insane
[266:17.37]What about the Bionicle movie?
[266:19.03]That's just not going to happen.
[266:22.27]There's no chance in hell.
[266:27.07]That is going to suck.
[266:44.12]What is this?
[266:44.94]Eyesore?
[266:52.91]So it just randomly shoots in a bunch of directions sometimes.
[266:57.06]Alright.
[266:57.32]That's pretty cool.
[267:05.46]You get so much more time too.
[267:06.98]Isn't it like 10 seconds or 12 seconds?
[267:09.33]And grittier.
[267:09.77]This is so much easier.
[267:22.43]Itchy nose.
[267:35.00]I'm dodging it too much.
[267:36.60]Oh my god, how have I got hit that many times in a row?
[267:48.65]Nightmare mode, go.
[268:01.67]I'm actually gonna die.
[268:03.13]Like the poop guy.
[268:07.21]It's like giant a Pinwheel.
[268:11.47]Okay.
[268:32.96]What is it?
[268:40.15]I don't want that thing.
[268:41.17]It's two hearts.
[268:42.49]It's too much to take.
[268:43.27]Will you just fuck off already?
[268:50.04]Get out of here.
[268:53.14]Rotten baby is good.
[268:56.02]You get a demon heart.
[268:56.86]Take the pact.
[268:57.96]Get it.
[268:58.26]It gives you black hearts.
[268:59.24]Is this guy serious?
[269:01.10]Take it.
[269:01.47]Take both.
[269:03.40]Act will give you hearts.
[269:04.76]Take it.
[269:09.18]Yeah, but I have to take damage as Samson.
[269:11.87]That's part of the deal.
[269:25.46]Oh, new deal.
[269:27.32]No, no deal.
[269:40.96]Samson Samson This is such a great game Intensifying tears
[270:11.64]What is it?
[270:12.06]Anyone know what that is?
[270:13.44]I've gotten that twice and I don't know what it is.
[270:16.28]Intensifying tears.
[270:30.07]You keep shooting in one direction?
[270:31.50]Shooting in one direction.
[270:37.70]Oh, okay.
[270:39.34]It takes... So I have to just hold it here in one direction and just spam?
[270:43.26]Holy shit, this is awesome.
[270:52.15]I can never stop shooting left.
[270:55.93]Okay, what do we got in here?
[271:01.65]Junk.
[271:02.17]Cat food.
[271:03.59]Maybe I'll get the cat food.
[271:07.01]What do you think?
[271:07.37]Left or right's better?
[271:08.13]We'll get it up there.
[271:15.98]Here we go.
[271:29.11]Pretty cool.
[271:38.79]Just machine gun that it can only fire in one direction.
[271:41.03]Okay.
[271:45.37]They're really inaccurate though.
[271:46.53]Come on, shoot behind.
[272:05.68]Why?
[272:15.89]What are these?
[272:21.49]I've never seen that guy before, I don't think.
[272:26.51]Alright.
[272:27.95]Tuna.
[272:29.24]Supper.
[272:29.56]HP up.
[272:33.36]Tears up.
[272:38.62]I can't go faster than that?
[272:46.52]Am I at the cap right now?
[272:51.46]I thought I could go past this.
[272:54.24]Hit the button.
[273:07.11]This is the fastest you can... What just happened?
[273:09.33]Why is there not a delay on being able to press that button?
[273:13.63]When you step on that button, you shouldn't be able to step on it again for like two seconds at least.
[273:17.59]That's good for this guy.
[273:40.77]Baby-proof the game.
[273:43.43]No.
[273:44.85]No, it should be like a half second or it's one second or something.
[273:57.34]You know how many times I've accidentally stepped on something like that?
[273:59.40]You have too.
[273:59.94]You just refuse to admit you do.
[274:01.50]Is there a secret door open?
[274:13.39]That happens to you once a day.
[274:15.97]Once a week.
[274:18.06]Well, that was not worth even doing the nightmare room.
[274:22.70]Um, hmm.
[274:27.58]Let's get a go.
[274:37.17]Are you alive?
[274:37.89]Yes, I am.
[274:44.33]the mulligan is this the thing that makes spiders um flies just come out of me while I shoot because if it is that's ridiculous that should be an insane build now stapler stapler
[275:14.47]Sus imposter guy, are you?
[275:16.57]You are?
[275:17.15]Yes.
[275:18.61]Me.
[275:19.35]Want an autograph?
[275:33.84]Cool.
[275:35.56]Uh, Ewas is passage, so Ewas is passage and it's two Ewas.
[275:46.77]What do I do?
[275:49.29]I think this just goes down to the next floor, right?
[276:00.49]Can spawn a ladder or a trapdoor?
[276:10.38]It's a trapdoor.
[276:11.28]Give me a ladder.
[276:28.37]Alright, let's see how good this mulligan works.
[276:40.17]I am super excited.
[276:43.20]What do you think?
[276:43.84]Down?
[276:44.24]I'm gonna go let's do down.
[276:51.26]Why did he abandon the first Jerma channel?
[276:54.84]That's season one.
[276:57.32]Season two is... See, the season one, season one through three is on that channel.
[277:03.17]Seasons four through six are on Twitch and Second Jerma.
[277:07.47]Those are different DVDs.
[277:09.09]Those are separate DVDs.
[277:15.34]You can't fit every season on one DVD.
[277:17.46]Remember you used to have to buy, like, ten DVDs?
[277:19.34]Look at these flies.
[277:29.45]Didn't even know they existed.
[277:46.18]I had to do it.
[277:51.25]I feel like I can hit horizontally better than I can hit vertically.
[277:53.63]Anybody else feel like that?
[278:27.76]Oh, come on.
[278:31.20]Oh, come on.
[278:31.80]Toy!
[278:33.40]Critical hits are hard to line up.
[278:39.76]Yeah, they are.
[278:44.58]What about this pink eraser thing?
[278:53.05]It's doy?
[278:59.62]and erases one enemy from the run.
[279:01.00]Hmm.
[279:04.13]I think I want to reroll this whole thing.
[279:15.64]Ooh.
[279:21.02]Very nice.
[279:26.56]Stapler, stapler.
[279:27.72]No, doesn't the stapler make you only shoot half shots?
[279:34.49]It's literally the worst play I've ever seen.
[279:35.77]I thought the stapler means you only shoot out of one eye.
[279:37.71]It's just damage up.
[279:46.76]It doesn't, it doesn't.
[279:48.08]Stapler's new.
[279:59.82]Don't be mean to me.
[280:07.21]Bet the coal.
[280:08.27]I don't think the coal will be any good here.
[280:15.45]Leave him alone.
[280:16.01]He's having fun.
[280:16.89]Alright, time for the psycho room.
[280:29.11]Nightmare, whatever it's called.
[280:34.75]He has long range.
[280:35.60]I already did that.
[280:47.84]Oops.
[281:13.28]I keep getting this item.
[281:14.78]Creep shots.
[281:17.88]And speed and range up.
[281:24.60]And a secret room.
[281:29.69]Ooh.

[282:22.88]The worst part about this is my tears are red.
[282:24.94]It's the worst.
[282:46.97]The tears are red.
[282:48.49]My tears are red, their tears are red, and the floor is red.
[283:16.08]This is just one of those awesome, cool collect-a-thon games.
[283:20.59]Check options to change bullet visibility.
[283:23.43]Really?
[283:28.13]Fuck.
[283:29.93]I got greedy on that one.
[283:40.98]Ooh.
[283:41.18]Did you get out of the corner?
[283:43.48]I'm not aiming that way.
[283:44.72]It's not fair.
[284:04.47]It was in the ground.
[284:07.03]You got auto-tuned?
[284:17.50]What?
[284:20.28]I'm not using the... I'm going to save it to the next floor.
[284:22.79]I don't want any of this.
[284:32.26]Give me an angel room.
[284:51.25]Oh my god!
[285:02.68]Oh no!
[285:03.98]They slowed down the- The tears slowed the fuck down in the creep and it messed up what I was moving.
[285:12.05]Alright, one more!
[285:21.27]God damn it!
[285:22.70]What the fuck was that?
[285:24.10]That sucked!
[285:29.44]Why?
[285:32.99]I had the diamond card too.
[285:34.87]This game needs to be easier.
[285:36.27]Just kidding.
[285:40.45]What the fuck?
[285:41.59]I really, like, why did I even go for it?
[285:44.67]It was the stupid creep shot stuff.
[285:48.00]It slowed the tears down that it lives was firing out and it just like was stuffed in front of my face.
[285:52.54]That was stupid.
[285:53.84]Stupid!
[285:54.86]Stupid!
[285:55.34]I was about to restart.
[285:58.64]I'm fucking furious.
[286:05.73]Just hit me.
[286:06.15]Hit me a bunch of times.
[286:06.77]I want max fucking damage.
[286:07.95]I'm... Just do it.
[286:16.84]Hit me more.
[286:17.42]More!
[286:26.68]This is not even gri- I beat Ultra Grieg with my fucking eyes closed.
[286:30.77]Like, every goddamn weekend.
[286:34.06]I can't be regular greed mode on stream?
[286:37.11]Huh?
[287:29.47]I'm winning this one.
[287:30.86]If I do not beat Greed... No, don't say that.
[287:33.52]Because, like, it's actually, like, pretty much like throwing dice in the air.
[287:39.74]You'll get a decent build to be able to get to, like, the last room.
[287:45.89]I might get, like, Mom's lipstick five times.
[287:48.03]I can't, like, make a prediction here.
[288:23.32]your mic is broken what did I peak the mic to a point where it like crashed alright I don't know what that is but I think I'm gonna buy it this is a pretty good start here don't blow it that's tears up what is that this is a weird looking item

[289:00.23]It's four shot.
[289:01.53]Who are you talking to?
[289:07.53]I'm talking to you.
[289:19.42]Whoa, what is happening?
[289:26.87]It's kind of like a booger.
[289:27.57]I remember the booger shots.
[289:29.84]Whoa, that's actually really cool.
[289:34.94]Oh, those are awesome.
[289:36.04]Alright.
[289:41.06]Oh, my God.
[289:41.40]Does the explosion hurt me?
[289:53.58]No, it doesn't.
[289:54.08]Okay.
[290:05.32]Okay.
[290:07.14]I really want that.
[290:08.48]That's tears up.
[290:11.28]Do I go in here and hope this coin's in here?
[290:23.35]Fuck.
[290:24.47]Wait.
[290:26.10]Um, what do I do?
[290:28.10]That eye is triple shot.
[290:29.52]Ugh.
[290:34.93]Should I blow these up?
[290:37.15]Blow up the beggar.
[290:37.69]Alright, give me a dime.
[290:46.43]Alright, what is better right now?
[290:48.97]Triple shot or a bunch of tears?
[290:51.47]Probably the triple shot.
[290:58.17]Now I need tears up.
[291:01.94]Oh shit.
[291:08.10]I don't have any keys.
[291:20.05]Damn it.
[291:23.85]Do I go for this and just get fucking furious that I die from the nightmare mode?
[291:39.08]Damn it.
[291:45.14]You got triple shot.
[291:45.72]You're fine.
[291:46.18]You say that.
[292:07.88]You better not!
[292:09.92]Fine.
[292:16.59]I can't get a key, though.
[292:17.51]Alright, well, whatever.
[292:29.97]This is the one.
[292:31.10]This is definitely the one.
[292:31.94]I need tears up and this is the one.
[292:34.54]Don't play like a fucking fool.
[292:37.00]Lump of coal.
[292:37.52]That's even better.
[292:43.50]Don't be a damn fool.
[292:53.33]Need keys.
[292:53.89]Tinted rock.
[292:57.55]Tinted rock.
[292:58.09]Tinted rock.
[293:03.08]Oh, wait.
[293:05.30]Oh, wait.
[293:22.53]Don't want you alive for the next one.
[293:34.68]What do you miss with a shotgun at point blank?
[293:39.83]Is it aiming at the ground?
[293:59.81]That, uh, explosive poison shot is awesome.
[294:06.14]Is that new?
[294:06.58]Feels like it's new.
[294:14.18]Alright, what do we got?
[294:21.11]I need keys.
[294:21.83]I'm going for key.
[294:30.21]Open this door.
[294:31.18]I don't know what this is.
[294:36.78]Leprosy.
[294:37.70]You're tearing me apart.
[294:47.40]Lisa.
[294:47.74]I don't know what this does.
[294:52.89]So do I roll the dice and open up both the chests or do I get the pajamas?
[295:04.90]Gamble?
[295:10.37]PJs?
[295:10.79]PJs is health.
[295:20.47]Yeah.
[295:21.47]Go for the sure thing.
[295:22.11]Go for the sure thing.
[295:41.12]Battery?
[295:41.46]I don't really have anything to charge right now.
[295:42.96]Yeah, this is the one.
[295:49.63]This is the run.
[295:50.33]I'll get it.
[295:50.65]This is really good.
[295:53.25]I just need some damage and tears up, and this is a guaranteed victory.
[296:06.21]Great spawn.
[296:11.33]Angel room.
[296:11.83]Yes!
[296:15.56]Oh dear, I don't know which one.
[296:19.86]The... Cross or the seagull?
[296:22.28]Dove, dove, dove.
[296:27.26]Take it.
[296:27.54]It's flight.
[296:28.12]Yeah.
[296:29.30]Right, right, right, right, right, right.
[296:32.10]Light and spectral tears.
[296:33.18]Ooh.
[296:33.32]Okay.
[296:33.48]Okay.
[296:40.20]I'm going to probably buy... I'm buying a key.
[296:44.96]I'm buying two keys, and we're going to gamble here.
[296:47.54]Let's hope it works.
[296:50.84]Yep.
[296:51.56]Not bad.
[296:52.54]Not bad doing it again.
[296:54.64]Bad.
[297:04.18]Buy car battery?
[297:05.28]No, I don't want it.
[297:11.69]I was hoping I was going to get a key in the chest.
[297:14.07]Oh, in the curse room?
[297:16.11]Curse room?
[297:25.02]I'm taking another key.
[297:28.30]Curse room is free.
[297:29.78]Oh, because I can fly.
[297:30.68]This is full health.
[297:34.10]I blow up the bed.
[297:41.91]Can I blow the bed up?
[297:44.51]I thought I didn't take damage.
[297:45.19]What are you talking about?
[297:45.91]What the hell is floating around me?
[298:00.28]Oh, only going in.
[298:01.00]Right, right, right.
[298:01.48]Wait, wait, wait.
[298:09.37]Sinus infection.
[298:10.35]Booger tears.
[298:12.19]Wait.
[298:14.38]I have booger and the fungus.
[298:19.20]That's really good.
[298:20.26]Okay, now I just need some tears up and this is guaranteed victory.
[298:25.38]I got two things that stick.
[298:37.17]Very nice.
[298:37.61]Alright, let's go see what's in here.
[298:41.02]Ooh, a bomb.
[298:50.45]Free?
[298:51.01]Eh.
[298:51.53]Oh look, the stapler!
[298:53.39]I could use... shots, damage and tears and shit.
[299:07.39]This is good, but it's going to be annoying.
[299:10.47]It's too slow.
[299:15.49]Cover them in boogers.
[299:17.17]Bombs.
[299:17.87]That's awesome.
[299:18.72]Look at that.
[299:19.06]These guys jump.
[299:34.13]I don't like it.
[299:51.86]Get Chaos?
[300:00.32]Chaos or Stapler?
[300:01.08]What does Chaos do?
[300:04.85]Or the Stapler?
[300:05.53]I feel like the Stapler's not going to be good.
[300:11.41]Chaos.
[300:12.31]Yeah, Chaos.
[300:12.97]It's fun.
[300:14.09]Take Chaos.
[300:14.39]Chaos.
[300:15.43]Chaos.
[300:17.96]Chaos.
[300:24.75]Ears up, range down?
[300:49.09]Chaos, chaos, chaos.
[300:51.45]Isn't that the devil?
[300:54.30]I can do anything.
[300:55.26]It's just chaos.
[300:57.36]Hey.
[301:19.69]I got to attach boogers to this guy.
[301:21.17]Another angel room.
[301:27.41]That's what we want.
[301:28.57]50-50 chance.
[301:30.51]Put the coin.
[301:38.17]You know, just... Oh, that's not what that does.
[301:44.97]Oops.
[301:45.81]I thought that was mom's foot.
[301:50.09]I got it wrong.
[301:50.47]I thought that was mom's foot stomps down.
[301:53.02]Oh Lord.
[302:00.56]Um, okay.
[302:00.94]There's a spider box and then a weird like gray remote control.
[302:06.08]Chaos.
[302:14.78]Chaos.
[302:18.36]Both are trash.
[302:19.06]Just skip.
[302:20.14]Well, I mean, it's a free item.
[302:26.86]Remote is useless.
[302:28.98]Box of spiders.
[302:29.80]It's a box of spiders.
[302:32.32]It is.
[302:32.58]This actually might not be useless.
[302:37.96]All it takes is two spawns, and I can do it again.
[302:41.88]Box is good.
[302:42.54]Ban that guy.
[302:43.29]I mean, look at this.
[302:46.75]It's pretty good.
[302:50.16]I don't have enough of the stapler.
[302:51.56]Sorry, stapler fans.
[302:54.09]I really wanted to see it.
[302:54.95]There it is.
[303:08.19]Move.
[303:24.89]Cricket?
[303:25.13]What do you mean cricket?
[303:31.38]Spiders everywhere, lookit.
[303:34.20]Um, what's this?
[303:35.92]Circle of protection, protect me from thyself.
[303:46.38]Cricket's head, damage up.
[303:49.12]Oh, now greed is guaranteed to die.
[303:56.51]It's guaranteed.
[303:57.35]Hanged man.
[304:13.06]Not gonna need it at all.
[304:14.90]Ooh.
[304:19.22]Sacred heart.
[304:19.84]Holy shit.
[304:22.26]What?
[304:24.22]Sacred heart.
[304:24.84]Sacred heart!
[304:26.18]Where?
[304:29.51]Oh, that's the Sacred Heart.
[304:31.27]Okay, let's do it.
[304:32.33]Let's go.
[304:32.89]Sacred Heart.
[304:33.47]Holy moly.
[304:34.63]What's the Sacred Heart do?
[304:35.45]Is it going to be cool?
[304:36.91]Are we all going to be collectively happy about this?
[304:40.05]I can just have infinite spiders here.
[304:56.23]This is perfect.
[304:59.84]Should've not even hit me.
[305:03.67]I don't get hit in these games.
[305:05.43]There must be a fucking bug in the code.
[305:38.23]Alright.
[305:40.27]What can I do now?
[305:41.67]Sacred Heart.
[305:47.13]And... Sacred Heart.
[305:48.93]Homing shots and damage up.
[305:52.67]Oh boy.
[305:53.18]I have 23 damage?
[306:12.19]I'm really sad that this is not on greedier mode because this would be like an instant kill to boss.
[306:19.04]Wow.
[306:19.22]That's unbelievable.
[306:21.06]That's unbelievable.
[306:21.96]I'm sad that we're only going to be able to see for like another five minutes.
[306:23.96]Is that angel room?
[306:44.28]get rotten baby oh what is all this stuff I don't want the fat thing that's luck in the middle what's on the right right is good lucky scab take the eye take the eye

[307:12.07]Yeah, it's HP and, uh... This one's HP, right?
[307:24.44]Okay.
[307:26.76]I don't know if I want that.
[307:33.41]Get it.
[307:34.31]Don't take the eye.
[307:35.61]Get the eye.
[307:36.31]Eye sucks.
[307:36.97]I don't know what... It's too much hearts to give up.
[307:38.65]I don't
[307:42.39]I can take one more thing.
[307:43.81]Or should I say, what's, what floor am I in?
[307:47.91]This is not the, no, I have one more opportunity.
[307:54.06]I have an opportunity next floor.
[307:57.28]Baby is take rotten baby.
[307:58.36]Yeah, I'll get rotten baby.
[308:02.28]There's more flies.
[308:03.00]Alright, let's go.
[308:16.16]You got the baby, but not the eye?
[308:17.34]Well, the baby didn't cost two hearts.
[308:24.82]What is that?
[308:26.04]I'm afraid of that.
[308:26.94]I don't know what it is.
[308:28.80]I'm afraid of all this stuff.
[308:30.10]Sticky bombs?
[308:31.10]Egg sack bombs?
[308:37.65]Knockout drops.
[308:38.57]They pack a punch.
[308:41.69]What the hell is that?
[308:42.65]Okay
[308:49.48]Take the keys.
[308:58.28]Hmm, I think this is new.
[308:59.59]I've never seen that before.
[309:00.33]This is like a silver bar?
[309:05.03]I'm not gonna touch the cat.
[309:06.23]No, I know what it is.
[309:06.97]I've played for long enough.
[309:09.21]Take the iron bar.
[309:18.60]Well, we'll see.
[309:33.63]Ooh, that was as good as you could have gotten.
[309:35.63]Except for that.
[309:37.75]That's a terrible card.
[309:44.95]Iron Bar is a damage and stun.
[309:52.00]Oh, that guy disintegrated.
[309:53.12]These people are fucking disintegrating.
[310:13.43]in the homing missiles too?
[310:14.75]Oh, this is ridiculous.
[310:21.74]Whoa.
[310:25.30]I don't even know what happened.
[310:34.72]Okay, we're good.
[310:35.42]Let's see if I can kill the boss in like two hits.
[310:50.22]That's awesome.
[310:52.00]Oh, it's so good.
[310:52.98]I never want to lose this build.
[310:54.74]I love this.
[310:55.92]Why can't I just keep this?
[310:57.92]Forever.
[311:01.31]I want every gameplay through to have this.
[311:02.97]Okay.
[311:12.99]Is that lemonade?
[311:13.87]Because if it is, don't you shoot a million miles per hour?
[311:20.17]I feel like that might be run ruining.
[311:29.33]I'm not sure any of these are worth it.
[311:30.43]It's the P one.
[311:38.10]What's the one on the left?
[311:43.94]No, I'm playing it safe.
[311:44.86]This build's way too good.
[311:46.12]I'm not taking anything.
[311:46.76]I'm just going to kill this guy.
[311:55.99]The one on the left re-rolls your stats.
[311:58.25]No thanks.
[312:02.72]Iron bar.
[312:03.30]Damage up in concussion tiers.
[312:10.34]26 damage?
[312:14.40]Lemon is just... No, lemon sucks.
[312:15.61]Alright, I'm not spending any more money.
[312:19.79]I'm going to use it on the machine at the end.
[312:20.91]Let's go.
[312:30.70]Get the cat.
[312:31.54]No.
[312:33.48]You get nine lives, but you get one heart.
[312:43.67]Hmm.
[312:45.71]Oh, it's that cat's quad.
[312:50.91]I'm doing it.
[312:51.49]Holy shit.
[312:57.96]Wow.
[312:59.06]And I got spider baby?
[313:03.42]I'm gonna kill greed in, like, five hits.
[313:23.51]Into the rock?
[313:26.16]Oh, shit, there it is.
[313:31.62]Alright, alright.
[313:32.19]No more money.
[313:32.99]This thing is ridiculous.
[313:34.11]This is truly ridiculous.
[313:37.37]Show the seed.
[313:38.05]Um, right there.
[313:40.15]This is not greedier, by the way.
[313:44.04]Unfortunately.
[313:44.60]I wish it was.
[313:45.16]This is just regular greed mode.
[313:59.69]I just want to stuff all these projectiles into greed's face.
[314:16.96]Oh god.
[314:29.10]Taking too much unnecessary hits.
[314:30.29]Stop it.
[314:44.02]Just survive.
[314:45.12]Aim in any direction.
[314:45.92]Okay.
[314:54.89]Bring it on.
[315:00.77]I just punched him off the screen.
[315:06.29]Didn't even get his intro animation to play.
[315:19.62]Best friends forever.
[315:22.14]All my buddies get to be bigger.
[315:23.62]Does that include the spiders?
[315:29.77]It does.
[315:31.31]Alright, let's rain hell.
[315:36.69]No, it doesn't?
[315:38.05]Oh, well.
[315:41.53]Um... I'm done.
[315:44.55]I'm going to just try to put as much money as I can into the machine.
[315:47.66]What was that?
[315:59.67]What is this stuff?
[316:00.37]What's that one?
[316:01.57]What's the weird ice cube thing?
[316:07.08]The onion?
[316:12.94]Onion.
[316:16.52]Take the shard of glass.
[316:18.08]Onion ring.
[316:18.66]Take the onion ring.
[316:21.70]Here's up.
[316:22.48]Doesn't it make you... Doesn't damage go down?
[316:31.70]DPS goes up.
[316:34.90]Let's go for it.
[316:38.34]Yeah, that's better.
[316:39.44]Alright, let's move.
[316:40.84]I'm done.
[316:41.60]Let's put the rest in the green machine.
[316:42.81]I want to just be so annoyingly powerful.
[316:50.17]Get the almond milk.
[316:54.03]I just fuck the whole thing up and get the almond milk and just spam.
[317:02.13]Alright, fine.
[317:07.90]Alright, ultra greed.
[317:08.94]Nobody in here.
[317:11.96]Whoa.
[317:13.92]Okay, let's go kick his ass.
[317:42.87]so much damage holy shit look at all the things stuck to him he's got stuff just attached to his body ow
[318:15.67]He's just covered in stuffed animals.
[318:23.49]Bye.
[318:30.20]23.
[318:30.44]Zero?
[318:33.92]Have I not, on this save file, have I not beaten greed mode once on this save?
[318:40.21]You unlock special hanging shopkeepers.
[318:45.25]The one that I have down on the switch has like 750 on grittier mode.
[318:50.61]I love this build, though.
[318:51.35]This is awesome.
[318:53.53]Wait, can I blow anything else up?
[318:54.54]Because... Oh, no.
[318:58.26]Sure.
[318:58.92]Fake fan.
[318:59.90]Yeah, whatever.
[319:00.52]Might as well use the tower.
[319:02.44]Oh, no.
[319:06.93]Oh, well.
[319:09.39]Alright, cool.
[319:22.23]Not even 50.
[319:23.13]What a bad streamer.
[319:25.13]Yeah, that's probably accurate.
[319:29.52]But f*** you though.
[319:39.32]Hooray!
[319:47.18]Alright, and the last thing I want to do... They added challenges.
[319:51.08]I'm kind of curious what they are.
[319:52.08]Where are they?
[320:01.06]Guardian?
[320:03.06]Brains.
[320:05.82]Which ones are the added challenges?
[320:06.90]People are fools.
[320:12.86]Demands?
[320:14.15]It's the last page?
[320:27.45]What the fuck is this?
[320:33.09]Poop.
[320:33.81]Touching poop gives me little poop monster people.
[320:52.16]I guess we just destroy everything.
[320:53.75]Am I going to eventually have a ton of these following me around?
[320:57.80]Walk into the enemies.
[321:07.36]Hey, why'd you tell me to do that?
[321:15.04]Hit him!
[321:21.24]Judgment.
[321:22.80]You can walk into normal enemies.
[321:28.39]You also heal when you walk into normal enemies.
[321:34.81]I am so confused right now.
[321:36.09]Why is this happening?
[321:45.00]You heal when you touch poop.
[321:50.00]Oh, fuck.
[322:00.15]Doi doi doi doi doy doy doy.
[322:03.15]Tinted rock? Kinda hard to see.
[322:11.00]Thank you.
[322:21.00]Wait. Mysterious candy?
[322:27.00]Or the money?
[322:32.83]He's pooping every room.
[322:35.91]Get the candy.
[322:39.40]Candy is what is healing you.
[322:40.72]Okay, yeah.
[322:51.14]He's playing Pikmin again.
[322:52.25]Boring.
[323:01.01]How did I get hit?
[323:02.19]I was in the middle of the crowd.
[323:03.53]Did it really go through everybody and hit me somehow directly in the head?
[323:22.38]How far do I have to go?
[323:23.66]Do I have to go all the way to beat mom's heart?
[323:42.06]And a boss is gonna be impossible if I don't have enough?
[323:46.66]Oh, just Mom's Foot.
[323:47.46]Okay.
[323:56.29]HP!
[324:05.25]Bombs are strong too.
[324:06.11]That's good to know.
[324:10.81]Walk into everybody.
[324:21.48]This is another insane run.
[324:23.46]This is a challenge.
[324:25.32]I did not make this happen.
[324:26.86]It's just here.
[324:29.56]It's on the game menu.
[324:33.53]Oh boy, look out.
[324:42.34]If only they were screaming in farts.
[324:43.94]Yeah.
[324:53.21]God.
[324:58.57]That doesn't matter.
[325:06.71]I think there's a certain amount that can be on screen.
[325:11.14]I think I'm replacing them.
[325:26.17]Why would there be a cap?
[325:31.87]And how is this a challenge?
[325:33.11]This is very easy.
[325:35.03]Am I missing something here?
[325:45.17]just fun it kind of is just fun cool alright let's go kill the boss mushroom HP up tears up shot speed down that doesn't matter
[326:14.04]I'll speak so soon, okay?
[326:15.68]I won't.
[326:30.29]Watch out, don't get killed.
[326:32.71]Can I stomp on this?
[326:38.29]Aww.
[326:43.21]Aww, what?
[326:45.49]Oh, it's the poop bombs.
[326:46.43]I know those.
[326:46.79]I feel like everybody on the screen gets hurt, right?
[326:57.80]Poop, poop.
[327:02.58]So, the next stream, we're going to try this weekly schedule here.
[327:08.01]I'm going to try to get The Sims 1 to work.
[327:13.89]find it.
[327:14.51]I'll make sure I can get it to run.
[327:16.49]We will do a Sims 1 night.
[327:20.37]And we'll see where it goes from there.
[327:21.25]I'm going to try.
[327:21.73]I'm going to see how this plays out.
[327:23.49]I'm going to go for it.
[327:29.71]It's sort of a little trial here to see how that plays out.
[327:38.09]I didn't pee once.
[327:38.79]I forgot to pee.
[327:42.55]Once the whole day.
[327:45.06]It's pretty rare.
[328:01.30]Get him!
[328:03.84]Is this the season finale?
[328:07.72]No, it's not the season finale.
[328:14.28]Do you not notice when you pee yourself?
[328:16.36]No, I'm good.
[328:17.52]Doesn't look like it.
[328:18.28]We're good.
[328:31.96]What do you unlock for doing this?
[328:35.34]Because you unlock items this way, right?
[328:52.33]I don't even care about the items.
[328:53.51]I don't even care about getting any money or anything.
[328:58.31]I just want to get to mom.
[329:07.80]Max poops are determined by your range stat.
[329:10.52]Okay.
[329:27.58]It's good to be back.
[329:29.28]It's good to see you all again.
[329:33.51]I will not be taking another break like that ever again.
[329:36.21]We're going to change up how we do things on the channel.
[329:42.36]Let's see what happens.
[329:54.38]The idea is having the kind of weekly show in quotes will make it so I don't have to ever do that again.
[330:02.19]Because I really don't want to do that again.
[330:03.31]Let's get him.
[330:15.37]Power twice?
[330:18.33]Can't wait for the next month break in June.
[330:22.83]That would be something, though, wouldn't it?
[330:25.91]Bombs are key.
[330:28.45]Why did I even buy that?
[330:44.98]Wait, can I not kill these?
[330:46.94]How do I kill these?
[330:47.52]I have to use bombs.
[330:48.58]I was going to say holy.
[330:51.32]Let's
[331:02.93]Alright, only one more.
[331:17.02]HP up.
[331:18.86]Crap.
[331:23.43]Take any break you need, man.
[331:24.39]We can handle it.
[331:26.95]I know.
[331:28.36]And I have.
[331:30.00]I disappeared for like three months back in last year.
[331:35.66]And then here we are again.
[331:36.60]I disappeared for like a month again.
[331:43.68]Less than probably about a year later.
[331:45.94]I really don't want to take like a month, two, three, four months off when I would rather just stream more like periodically.
[331:56.93]And that allows me to kind of do all the stuff that I need to do.
[331:58.79]And it's not just the medical stuff too.
[332:02.83]I have other stuff going on too that I really have to focus on.
[332:09.96]And I'm going to stream for fun.
[332:13.68]And when I think it's fun to do.
[332:15.62]There's lots of opportunities to do games and play different things and...
[332:23.93]Come up with some new ideas.
[332:25.25]And there's a bunch of big stuff coming that's happening soon.
[332:31.71]I need to be in a mindset to, you know, feel like it and want to.
[332:35.37]Am I going to kill him?
[332:41.64]I saved the money.
[332:43.52]Yeah.
[332:45.22]I might need it.
[333:04.02]no this guy stinks honey or no I don't want that
[333:23.78]How come this guy's not making any jokes?
[333:26.70]I think the screen is really self-explanatory.
[333:29.04]How do I add to this?
[333:30.70]Besides, I'm making fart noises myself.
[333:38.97]It's stealing material from me.
[333:41.05]Usually, I would be the one making the poo-poo noises and the fart faces and stuff.
[333:52.11]Shot speed up.
[333:54.38]And the Empress.
[333:55.06]No.
[333:55.18]Give me the Hermit.
[334:00.61]Alright, this is it.
[334:02.53]What do we get?
[334:03.01]What do I get for doing this?
[334:13.81]Kill him.
[334:29.33]Whatever.
[334:29.67]I don't even care if it hurt me.
[334:32.37]I don't even care if it hurts.
[334:35.36]Should we say right or left?
[334:36.84]I'm just gonna skip it.
[334:38.14]I don't even care.
[334:45.18]Down?
[334:50.40]Maybe.
[334:56.93]Make him hit himself on the thing.
[334:57.89]Come here.
[335:06.22]Yeah, Fortnite, we about to get down.
[335:07.78]10 kills forward right now.
[335:10.46]My friend just got down.
[335:12.82]I revived, and then we're going southbound.
[335:16.39]Step in the gas, we're going hard.
[335:17.87]Straight out of the gas, we're going... I don't know.
[335:20.21]However it goes.
[335:28.87]Alright, what does this do?
[335:30.27]This was kind of just running around killing stuff with poop.
[335:32.43]And...
[335:58.57]Let's go kill Hope I don't die He's stepping on them and killing them
[336:29.36]Ooh, money!
[336:31.06]Ooh!
[336:31.98]Money!
[336:35.14]Spawn somebody!
[336:36.54]And... Hooray!
[336:41.05]Wait, what's this part?
[336:59.25]Got it.
[337:00.97]Oh.
[337:02.07]Dirty mind has appeared in the basement.
[337:12.66]Did I unlock any other ones?
[337:22.12]No, not yet.
[337:22.62]Alright, I think that's going to be it.
[337:28.01]I will see you guys probably on Saturday.
[337:32.59]We're going to go Saturday next time.
[337:35.51]I'm going to spend the week here going back and forth with some stuff and medical stuff too.
[337:44.27]Let's see how this plays out.
[337:45.71]I'm really trying to find out if this is going to be worth doing or not.
[337:49.12]I'm hoping it is.
[337:52.06]But at least you know, I'm not gone.
[337:54.62]I'm here.
[337:55.36]It's just going to be like a weekly show, maybe two times a week.
[337:59.98]I'm not just going to close the door on, let's say that it's every Saturday.
[338:04.59]That Sunday, there won't ever be a stream.
[338:07.25]So there'll probably be lots of occasions where it's like Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday.
[338:15.75]That's what I'm assuming is going to happen.
[338:19.80]So we'll find out.
[338:27.01]I will be back.
[338:27.95]I'll see you guys again.
[338:28.83]Thanks for watching.
[338:29.51]I know we've kind of just played Isaac, but really looking forward to it.
[338:33.10]We're going to do The Sims 1 next weekend.
[338:37.52]Take care of yourselves.
[338:38.22]I'll have a lot more to talk about next weekend as well.
[338:42.39]And I would assume that because we're playing The Sims 1...
[338:46.21]You can probably assume a Saturday-Sunday scenario.
[338:50.61]Because you can't get a whole lot done in just like one day in The Sims.
[338:55.96]So we'll probably do our first 1-2 next weekend.
[339:00.26]Because I want to give The Sims 1 time to play it and have fun.
[339:02.46]So we'll see.
[339:05.74]Have a great rest of your night.
[339:06.82]Lots of shit is in the works.
[339:08.43]I hope you enjoy it when you see it in the coming few months.
[339:12.49]Again, Grotto Beasts is a real thing.
[339:14.39]There'll be more info of that next week.
[339:18.34]Take care of yourselves.
[339:21.66]There were a lot of community subs.
[339:22.76]Take a look.
[339:27.14]This is going to fly.
[339:27.90]There's a lot of subs.
[339:31.63]When you don't stream for a month, you get like a barcode scan going by.
[339:38.53]Oh my goodness.
[339:44.39]And I want to make this really clear too for people to just because I really want to say it.
[339:49.73]I understand, like I get it.
[339:52.59]If you've been a sub or if you are thinking of subbing and you don't think that like four or five streams a month is worth subbing, don't.
[340:01.97]I don't want you to if you don't think that's worth it.
[340:04.87]So I'm dialing back the streams to a point where I don't want people to still feel obligated to think that they have to stay subscribed if they don't think that paying for like essentially optionally paying for like four or five streams a month is worth it.
[340:20.46]So I'm not going to hold that against anybody if they don't want to stay subbed to the channel, even people that have been here for a long time.
[340:32.21]I need to make that really clear.
[340:39.19]He hates his subs.
[340:40.85]No.
[340:45.10]What about Badge Andy?
[340:47.26]That's right.
[340:51.84]I have to give you money.
[340:53.34]You don't.
[340:59.00]Sub even harder.
[341:01.04]No, I... I want you to think it's worth watching whatever you're watching.
[341:06.00]And if we slow down a lot... It's alright.
[341:15.30]This is ridiculous, though.
[341:16.30]How many subs is it today?
[341:17.34]I need to know.
[341:19.71]Oh, Jesus.
[341:21.13]It was... Let's get a good picture here.
[341:31.11]I think, I think like, you know what?
[341:34.62]No, I'm not even going to say.
[341:37.04]I'm not even going to say it.
[341:39.94]Because I don't want to talk about that.
[341:42.78]I don't want to be like, oh, hey, wow, X amount of subs today.
[341:45.83]Awesome.
[341:47.49]I don't think I'm even going to say it.
[341:48.91]I don't think it needs to be said.
[341:56.10]Because I think that saying it is almost like me inceptioning into your mind.
[342:00.13]Like, wow, look at how many subs were today.
[342:02.91]I mean, see you next week.
[342:04.37]I mean, I better still have them.
[342:06.97]I don't think I want to do that anymore.
[342:12.81]So, thank you though.
[342:14.53]It was a lot.
[342:19.31]And with that, I will see you on Saturday.
[342:22.05]And probably Sunday, too, for Sims 1.
[342:24.39]We're going back to the original, the scary one.
[342:30.40]Have a great rest of your night.
[342:31.28]Have a great rest of your weekend.
[342:34.02]We will see you real soon.
[342:35.86]And I hear Otto, perfect timing, just asked me for dinner.
[342:38.69]He just said something at the door.
[342:46.79]Yeah, that's right.
[342:47.53]Somebody who's streaming right now.
[342:50.58]He said Joel.
[342:51.18]Let's see.
[342:51.44]What's Joel doing?
[342:52.88]What's he up to?
[342:58.37]Who is streaming?
[343:05.31]Can I not go to my manager here?
[343:06.75]There it is.
[343:14.49]I can't see it.
[343:15.11]My monitor is hiding.
[343:18.76]Haunted PS1 demo discs?
[343:21.65]Alright, that sounds pretty great.
[343:23.77]I'll see you guys later.
[343:24.45]Have a great rest of your week.
[343:30.55]I'll probably have some more Grotto Beasts information when I see you on Saturday.
[343:34.75]Good night.
[343:35.37]Goodbye.
[343:35.91]Take care of yourself.
[343:38.13]I'm going to try to.
[343:38.74]Take it easy.
[343:41.72]Go save little Joel.
[343:45.38]Take care.
[343:56.17]Thank you.
[344:31.31]you
[345:05.93]Thank you.
[345:40.80]Thank you.
