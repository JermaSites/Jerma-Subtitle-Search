[00:04.91]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode two of Grandpa is a- Get fucking tomahawked, you dickhead!
[00:12.49]This is episode two, like I said, and in this episode, we're gonna talk about the different game modes.
[00:18.15]And I'm gonna make sure that I break them all down for you.
[00:20.77]Tell you which ones are the fun ones, which ones are the most interesting, which ones you really wanna play.
[00:26.66]Give you all the tips, give you all the secret strategies, you guys know the deal.
[00:31.34]You're talking to the best player in the world, you guys all know that, I don't have to tell you twice.
[00:36.02]So let's get right into this here, one of the more important things you need to real- Then you grab the green turtle shell, and jumping's kinda hard, it's A to jump.
[00:44.68]So you jump on this platform, and then you jump on this one, and then you kick the fucking turtle shell right- What the fuck was that?
[00:54.26]I didn't fucking do that.
[00:56.18]Hold on.
[00:57.30]I gotta fix this video, guys.
[01:00.05]I have no idea how to fix the video.
[01:03.93]Let's just move on then, I guess.
[01:05.73]I'm sorry about that.
[01:07.71]So the first game mode that I want to cover is called Domination.
[01:11.55]And I don't know why they call it Domination.
[01:13.57]It doesn't make any sense.
[01:14.87]You see, it's just golf.
[01:16.62]That's all this is.
[01:17.42]You're just trying to get a hole in one with your grenades and your flashbangs.
[01:20.66]Now let me just try and line this up here.
[01:22.50]I think I got it right there.
[01:24.08]Did I get any points or something?
[01:28.14]Hey!
[01:28.95]Nobody ever plays a fucking objective in this fucking game mode!
[01:34.41]Alright, Grandpa, let's go.
[01:35.47]That's it.
[01:36.39]What the fuck are you talking about?
[01:37.75]I don't have to go anywhere.
[01:38.41]Yes, you do.
[01:38.91]We get two hours each on the computer.
[01:40.43]You don't remember us having a big family discussion about this?
[01:42.97]No.
[01:43.27]What are you talking about?
[01:44.77]We get two hours each, and you're breaking that rule right now, and it's not fair.
[01:49.32]The next game mode I want to talk about is something called Kill Confirmed.
[01:53.86]And let me tell you guys, this is probably the best game mode in the entire game.
[01:58.29]And essentially, I'll tell you how it works.
[02:00.41]So you shoot somebody, and then you pick up the piece of cheese.
[02:03.83]And I don't know why it's cheese.
[02:05.53]I didn't make the game, so don't ask me.
[02:08.28]You really have to listen to this one, though, guys.
[02:10.22]This is really, really important.
[02:12.44]Do not touch the red ones.
[02:15.94]I don't even want to find out what happens if you touch a red one, but I think it probably fucking kills you.
[02:22.30]Alright, now seriously, get up.
[02:24.06]No.
[02:24.64]Get up from the goddamn seat.
[02:26.28]Get up right now.
[02:27.28]This is bullshit.
[02:28.12]No, you know what?
[02:29.12]Look at the clock, Jeremy.
[02:30.22]Take a look.
[02:30.64]What are you talking about?
[02:32.12]What?
[02:32.42]Look at the clock.
[02:33.20]It's 1.15.
[02:33.96]Look outside.
[02:34.58]It's pitch black outside.
[02:36.05]You really expect me to believe it's 1.15?
[02:37.89]Yes.
[02:38.35]Are you out of your fucking mind?
[02:40.47]Did you see the news?
[02:41.37]They said it was super daylight savings time.
[02:43.31]That's what I heard.
[02:45.41]There's not really this many game modes in this game, is there?
[02:49.70]This is ridiculous.
[02:50.74]I've only done, what, two?
[02:52.80]There's no way this is happening.
[02:55.26]So, uh... Thanks, everybody, for watching, and... I have to get off the computer anyways, because somebody said, DICKHEAD!
[03:04.06]So, thanks, everybody, for watching, and I will talk to you later.
[03:08.74]So, peace, love, and respect across the globe.
[03:14.33]And I just, I gotta get up now.
[03:15.77]It's just... You see, Dad can't take it.
[03:19.06]God, we need to be a fucking asshole.
[03:21.17]That's fine.
