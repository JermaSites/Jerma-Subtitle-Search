[00:15.70]Hello.
[00:20.06]Uh... Well, this is bad.
[00:29.55]Come on, you can do it, Comcast.
[00:31.27]I know you can.
[00:33.55]You piece of shit.
[00:36.95]Well... Maybe not.
[00:49.19]52% dropped frames.
[00:52.27]Oh, that's wonderful.
[01:06.36]That's wonderful.
[01:12.12]Okay, what happens?
[01:14.71]What happens if I rip out the Ethernet cable and plug it back in?
[01:18.17]Will the stream go down?
[01:19.39]Oh, it'll try to auto-connect, won't it?
[01:26.56]I love this NPR podcast.
[01:31.48]Okay, so... Just relax a little.
[01:37.58]Take a load off here on the drive back home.
[01:41.53]Mm-hmm.
[01:44.32]Sustainable seafood.
[01:47.60]The name of the game tonight.
[01:49.88]Where does your food come from?
[01:54.60]Off a boat or out of an ocean?
[02:00.00]That's the topic we're going to say tonight.
[02:03.01]We have Dr. R. Redford, who is a professor of modern science at the Sustainable Seafood Organization of America.
[02:11.37]He's going to be here to give us some data.
[02:15.28]And then we've got all of you.
[02:17.80]Call in.
[02:20.49]Well, we don't take calls on NPR.
[02:21.99]Never mind.
[02:24.85]Thanks for the money!
[02:25.53]Thanks for the money!
[02:26.23]Thanks for the money!
[02:32.11]Can I stream tonight?
[02:33.55]What the fuck?
[02:39.70]Ugh.
[02:43.31]It was +2.
[02:44.51]Now it's -2.
[02:48.38]Hold on.
[02:54.60]This is going to be one of those weird streams.
[02:56.32]It might not even be a stream.
[02:59.72]I'm dropping 50% of every frame.
[03:02.82]So this might be a no fucking stream.
[03:06.06]Didn't you move to fix this?
[03:07.24]I'm not there yet.
[03:09.44]I'm in an empty house right now.
[03:16.42]I'll be there on the sixth.
[03:20.46]Just hope we're gonna give it a second.
[03:21.62]We'll see.
[03:25.25]Spoiler alert on the screen right now.
[03:26.93]That's the game we were gonna play.
[03:34.69]The lights aren't even working.
[03:35.97]What a bad stream.
[03:36.92]Yeah, guys, sorry.
[03:43.34]I didn't pay the electrical bill either.
[03:50.89]Got old-timey audio quality.
[03:52.45]Yeah, we do.
[03:56.25]Yeah, we also got like old-timey internet quality as well.
[04:02.19]You know?
[04:03.49]You know, less than one megabit up?
[04:06.21]That's... fuckin' 2006.
[04:07.45]What a pain in the ass.
[04:19.62]You know, every time this happens, and every time we look at this, and how it's been pretty shoddy over the last... Obviously, it seems to happen every time, but... Man, this is never fucking gonna happen ever again.
[04:29.57]Like, isn't that just great to know that?
[04:31.31]In less than two weeks.
[04:33.67]You will never see this again.
[04:35.79]I will never have to do this again.
[04:41.78]Comcast is still stuck in the 50s.
[04:43.36]Ugh.
[04:48.96]How was my birthday?
[04:49.60]My birthday was great.
[04:59.36]I want more protest streams.
[05:02.64]I'm in my pajamas too.
[05:04.56]I wasn't fucking ready for this shit.
[05:11.68]God damn it.
[05:16.48]I didn't even shower.
[05:18.86]Ow.
[05:20.84]I'm in nurse pants right now.
[05:25.41]Just wait.
[05:25.93]Let me just do this.
[05:32.55]Did I have cake?
[05:34.09]I did have cake.
[05:36.45]I don't really eat the cake, though.
[05:37.61]I kind of just look at it and smell it and I go, hey, well, yeah.
[05:39.99]And I grab my fork and I take one little forkful and I just eat that one bite because cake is gross.
[05:47.30]And then I go, oh, this is so moist.
[05:50.00]And then I put it down somewhere on a table.
[05:53.58]And then that's it.
[05:56.14]I don't think anybody eats cake.
[05:57.72]I think that's what happens.
[06:01.25]Every single person does that.
[06:02.77]So why don't you just make, instead of making a cake, just make a piece of cake that everyone will take one forkful of, and you don't have so much waste.
[06:17.54]Ice cream cake is good.
[06:18.44]Well, ice cream cake is not cake, though.
[06:21.04]That's cake.
[06:23.00]That is a cake-shaped ice cream.
[06:33.26]Well, let's see how ugly I am today.
[06:35.58]I'm going to be pretty ugly.
[06:36.92]I'm just going to make sure you guys are aware of that.
[06:38.32]This is an ugly day.
[06:45.10]See what I'm talking about?
[06:46.92]Today is an ugly day.
[06:54.18]Come on, you're supposed to be like, no, no, you look great.
[06:57.28]It's too overexposed.
[06:58.38]I'm going to drop the quality.
[07:00.65]Don't have to do that.
[07:01.43]It already is doing that.
[07:11.35]Off sync, yeah, I'll fix it.
[07:15.41]This is such a fucking pain in the ass.
[07:18.23]I normally, like, you know, typical, if we were, if this was any other scenario, right, I would be like, oh, fucking Comcast, fucking Comcast sucks, and, like, they're the worst company I've ever seen under pressure I'm working with.
[07:29.26]I would do that right now, but, you know, I'm gone from here.
[07:31.32]I'm out of here.
[07:32.44]I'm gone.
[07:34.18]You should be happy this is the last time you're going to see it, baby, because this is it.
[07:46.54]There.
[07:47.60]That's better.
[07:52.20]Show off your strong muscle.
[07:58.64]Is this the green screen background?
[08:00.10]No.
[08:01.82]This is basement.
[08:06.26]Why do you look like you're wearing the hairdresser cape waiting for a haircut?
[08:13.56]What?
[08:16.10]What does that mean?
[08:16.96]Are you saying I need a haircut?
[08:20.64]Look at my eyes, too.
[08:21.68]Like, it's been rough, man.
[08:24.10]This is, like, you know how people do, like, those expose kind of, like, this is me without makeup.
[08:29.43]Like, this is me without makeup on.
[08:31.69]You understand?
[08:32.39]Look at these, like, dark circles and shit.
[08:34.19]You guys see, like, I put on, like, at least, like, 30 or 40 minutes of makeup before every stream.
[08:43.13]Hold on.
[08:43.37]Let me fix this.
[08:45.33]I've been through some shit.
[08:46.35]It's been a rough week.
[08:47.17]It has.
[08:47.45]Hold on.
[08:54.21]Why is auto focus on?
[08:55.59]That's why I look so bad.
[08:58.44]Blame the... The gain is up 100%.
[09:02.26]Why would you... Who did that?
[09:03.98]I didn't do that.
[09:04.54]Look how much better I look now.
[09:06.30]Hold on.
[09:14.33]You ever want to make somebody look really fucking bad?
[09:18.81]Just take a camera, take a picture of somebody, and then raise the gain or exposure up.
[09:24.45]You'll get to see all, you get to see how fucking ugly they really are.
[09:27.81]What's going on?
[09:30.48]Why did that take so long?
[09:34.32]Ready?
[09:37.00]Look at how bad I really look.
[09:39.46]This is, this is with all the lights up and all the gain up as high as it can go.
[09:45.95]back to being back to being like a seven there we go back to being a seven that's where I belong are we still having fucking frame drops sudden pimple it's been rough I've had a stressful day I've had a stressful week I can't fucking believe it's doing this right now
[10:16.56]No, stop it.
[10:17.24]Stop it.
[10:17.64]I have to stop.
[10:19.70]Stop.
[10:20.80]Just relax.
[10:23.10]And just remember, I'm going to get the last laugh.
[10:26.32]I'm gone.
[10:28.87]I get the last laugh, right?
[10:31.15]Because I'm not going to be here anymore.
[10:34.77]There's nobody behind me.
[10:46.40]I'm actually, like, very happy that two of the next six streams are not going to be here.
[10:53.87]They're going to be in different places.
[10:55.29]Like, I'm so glad that there's only, like, one, two, three, maybe three or four more streams that will be from this house.
[11:04.39]Two of them will not fucking be here.
[11:07.85]I'm so happy about that.
[11:12.39]If you leave, that means they won't.
[11:14.37]No, this is a tactical retreat.
[11:17.33]for me to go and get my offensives up in Las Vegas.
[11:25.25]This is a tactical retreat.
[11:26.45]I didn't lose.
[11:34.96]I'm a coward.
[11:41.76]You know, I was just thinking about it.
[11:43.00]I'm not going to do it because that's not... I'm not going to do that.
[11:47.18]But the Comcast box is right there.
[11:50.55]And, like, how fitting and how funny would it be?
[11:53.43]I mean, the stream's gonna turn off.
[11:54.95]It just is.
[11:55.35]The stream's gonna turn off.
[11:56.99]But, like, what if I just hammered that thing until the stream turned off?
[12:01.30]I mean, just take a fucking hammer and smash it until the stream turns off.
[12:07.82]I'm still plugged into it.
[12:18.89]Yeah, I still got another at least three or four streams from here.
[12:26.44]17,000 drop frames.
[12:34.22]Well, this was fun.
[12:39.59]I'm going to go ahead and just put this over here because I'm not tweeting out this fucking stream.
[12:45.57]And I'm going to...
[12:48.96]It might fix the issue.
[12:50.62]I'll kick it once.
[12:54.18]Okay, you know... Fuck it.
[12:58.35]I wonder...
[13:21.51]So you tell me.
[13:22.19]You tell me what happens, okay?
[13:26.71]Here it is.
[13:27.81]Here's the box.
[13:29.27]It's currently plugged into my computer.
[13:31.37]Can I get, like, can I turn it this way a little?
[13:35.87]Is there a scenario where, like, I fucking blow on this?
[13:39.43]Like an old Nintendo cartridge?
[13:41.72]Remember you used to be able to, like, fucking grab it and, like, squeeze it and it would, your game would turn on?
[13:46.58]You just had to hit the reset button, like, three times?
[13:50.35]Okay, ready?
[13:50.81]Tell me what happened.
[13:56.90]Did it fix it?
[14:07.22]I'm not seeing any dropped frames.
[14:13.19]Are you serious?
[14:14.89]No.
[14:16.63]No, that did not just fix the problem.
[14:21.35]Now it's fucked up.
[14:25.21]I'm going to get electrocuted again.
[14:31.33]This is the ethernet.
[14:32.69]I don't want to pull this out.
[14:35.38]If I pull this out, we're done.
[14:37.30]This is the red wire, so I don't pull that out, because otherwise it's going to explode.
[14:41.72]I'm not pulling the red wire.
[14:45.10]Which wire do I cut?
[14:55.00]I'm going to do an experiment.
[14:57.32]Watch this shit.
[14:58.78]This will prove about data.
[15:01.54]We're going to get a data fucking experiment.
[15:03.70]I'm so excited!
[15:05.44]Can you guys hear me?
[15:08.26]Oh, fuck.
[15:08.64]You guys probably couldn't even hear me.
[15:10.30]Now you can hear me.
[15:10.90]Okay, that's better.
[15:11.60]Are you ready for the data experiment?
[15:15.25]So let's see.
[15:15.73]This is the Ethernet cable.
[15:16.79]I'm going to pull this out and put it back in as fast as I can.
[15:19.37]And let's see what happens.
[15:22.30]I'm gonna fucking just go with the Ethernet.
[15:24.52]This is like our lifeline here.
[15:26.68]I'm gonna flatline this and put us right back in.
[15:29.71]Ready?
[15:31.99]Here we go.
[15:33.27]I'll see you on the other side!
[15:34.87]In and out!
[15:41.87]Wait a minute.
[15:44.65]Wait a minute.
[15:45.58]Wait a minute.
[15:46.66]Wait a minute.
[15:57.51]Why are we still alive?
[16:01.49]Oh.
[16:08.34]I know what the problem is.
[16:09.72]Fuck.
[16:15.54]Guys.
[16:17.72]This is not even plugged into the fucking computer.
[16:20.79]I'm out of Wi-Fi.
[16:24.31]Oh, I'm about to...
[16:33.19]This is plugged in, look it, look, look!
[16:39.99]I knew something was fucking wrong.
[16:43.05]This is not even a Comcast problem.
[16:46.09]Watch this!
[16:52.42]You've disconnected a LAN cable!
[16:56.56]I wonder what that means!
[17:00.34]Let's see let's see if it like instantly goes back to normal.
[17:03.00]I just plugged it in because I had to touch it Just wait.
[17:06.34]Let's see if we get like frames back Ready here we go Watch out watch out Okay Wait a minute what?
[17:31.04]Wait a minute.
[17:31.54]Hold on a second.
[17:32.70]Hold on a second.
[17:33.90]Hold on a second.
[17:35.78]Hello?
[17:37.24]Hello?
[17:41.55]Am I live?
[17:48.07]I don't know what's happening.
[17:49.05]I can't... Where's the chat?
[18:05.20]I think I'm on another plane of existence.
[18:09.64]Alright, so that... It didn't even fix the fucking problem!
[18:39.29]It's worse somehow.
[18:42.17]Look, hold on.
[18:43.13]Look, listen to me.
[18:43.79]This is what happened.
[18:46.83]I... God fucking damn it, man.
[18:51.77]Okay, so let me explain to those of you that have no idea what's going on.
[18:58.06]I disabled the Wi-Fi.
[18:59.84]This is on LAN right now.
[19:01.20]There's no Wi-Fi.
[19:01.86]Here's what I had to do.
[19:02.50]Because the PlayStation 4, right...
[19:06.70]I had to... Wi-Fi is disabled.
[19:09.26]It's not on Wi-Fi.
[19:10.76]Before I turned the stream back on, I checked it.
[19:12.98]It's not... There's no Wi-Fi.
[19:14.46]Wi-Fi is gone.
[19:15.60]I'm on, like, LAN right now.
[19:19.74]Disable LAN.
[19:20.54]Why would I do that?
[19:23.06]But anyways, listen, listen, listen.
[19:24.32]Before anyone says, like, you are an idiot, I mean, yes, for this particular... Look, get out of my face, okay?
[19:30.50]Get out of my face.
[19:31.72]Get out of my face.
[19:37.31]Before anybody... Wait a minute.
[19:38.43]Just stop it.
[19:39.47]Just wait one second.
[19:40.35]Let me explain myself.
[19:43.07]Let me explain myself.
[19:45.73]So I had the PlayStation 4 is all I got here.
[19:48.35]I brought the PlayStation 4.
[19:52.13]I have two lines in my house.
[19:55.49]I have a residential line and I have the Comcast business line, right?
[19:59.34]So the residential line is usually... I don't have Wi-Fi on this thing.
[20:04.51]I was connected to my residential Wi-Fi right there.
[20:07.69]But because it's slow to download games on PlayStation 4, I took the wired cable that I usually have plugged into the computer and put it into the PS4.
[20:17.34]PS4 downloads the game faster, and then before the stream I switch it, right?
[20:21.64]I didn't do that this time, I was just on Wi-Fi here, but it doesn't fucking matter because it's still a huge problem.
[20:27.62]I haven't been connected to Wi-Fi the whole fucking time I've ever been streaming from this house, guys.
[20:32.20]Just be aware of that.
[20:33.46]This isn't even the same computer.
[20:36.46]This is not even the same fucking computer.
[20:40.83]Alright, let's try this again.
[20:42.27]Because it's still fucked up.
[20:44.03]Now we are actually connected to this.
[20:47.71]You ready?
[20:51.18]Now we are connected to it.
[20:55.18]Here we go.
[21:04.96]It just got like way worse.
[21:06.45]Alright, I'm going to try that.
[21:09.83]Here we go.
[21:10.23]Ready?
[21:11.15]Here we go.
[21:12.53]This time, this experiment will work.
[21:15.03]Are you ready?
[21:19.69]Shake it the other way.
[21:20.57]Hold on.
[21:22.43]If I unplug this again, we're still on.
[21:26.00]Ugh.
[21:28.32]Ready?
[21:31.02]Ah!
[21:36.51]Did it work?
[21:41.82]We're good.
[21:42.72]See?
[21:42.98]That's how I can prove that I'm connected to this.
[21:45.10]You want to prove it?
[21:46.12]Ready?
[21:46.36]Watch this.
[21:46.99]Three, two, one.
[21:49.25]And we're back.
[21:50.59]And we're back.
[21:52.89]And we're back.
[21:58.56]No, please don't do it again.
[21:59.96]Don't do it again.
[22:00.48]I'm not prepared.
[22:01.40]Don't do it again.
[22:02.16]Oh.
[22:02.78]Ugh.
[22:22.05]Oh shit.
[22:22.70]He's no, no, no.
[22:23.42]You guys want to see a magic trick?
[22:59.56]Oh, I'm sorry.
[23:03.04]I didn't see you there.
[23:06.43]Poof, right?
[23:07.17]Here we go.
[23:07.65]Poof.
[23:41.02]Is it broken?
[23:42.66]Did it break it?
[23:52.96]I did it, ah, yeah, I can't, I did that too many times.
[23:56.49]I did it out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in like six times.
[24:00.61]I can't do that again.
[24:05.25]What do these buttons do?
[24:07.39]Oh, I don't want to show my serial number.
[24:10.53]Hold on, is that what that is?
[24:19.61]It's like a fucking password.
[24:22.01]Alright, I got an idea.
[24:26.87]How about we give it a DDT onto the mat?
[24:35.04]Don't look at that.
[24:35.80]Don't look at that.
[24:44.28]Well, I don't know what else to do with this.
[24:54.65]It didn't help.
[24:59.43]Wear your microphone necklace.
[25:01.65]Thanks for reminding me.
[25:04.49]Stream from your phone.
[25:05.83]Oh, you think that my phone's going to be any better than this?
[25:08.23]My phone won't even be able to connect.
[25:18.35]I'm gonna get, like, shocked if I'm not fucking careful, seriously.
[25:26.04]L.A.
[25:26.24]Noire looks really good, yeah, I wish I could play it.
[25:39.32]Play from McDonald's Wi-Fi?
[25:46.41]What else is new?
[25:46.97]What happened to the news today?
[25:48.13]I don't know.
[25:50.63]Who knows?
[25:55.55]Just punt it?
[25:56.29]I can't.
[25:56.77]I have to give that back to Comcast.
[26:07.76]What if I plug this into another mode of...
[26:13.94]Don't be sad.
[26:15.54]I'm not sad anymore.
[26:16.72]I'm just... What am I going to do, right?
[26:25.43]Okay, somebody look it up on the internet because I can't.
[26:28.97]If I remove the cable, like the coaxial cable, will I get electrocuted?
[26:36.28]Why would you even write that?
[26:38.50]Why would you even look that up?
[26:40.90]Who would be looking that up?
[26:43.31]Like, hey, dear Google, if I pull the coaxial cable out, will I get electrocuted?
[26:54.59]Oh, no, you're going to be fine.
[26:56.11]Yeah.
[26:57.01]Says you.
[26:58.73]Should I go get, like, big rubber gloves?
[27:14.29]Only one way to find out.
[27:15.29]Well, I'll turn... Look.
[27:16.53]Here's another experiment we can do.
[27:19.12]If I unplug this, will it turn off?
[27:20.64]Because I think there's like an internal super battery in here.
[27:23.44]Let's test and see how good this thing is.
[27:26.16]You know what I mean, Comcast?
[27:27.42]Wait, when I just knocked, it was better.
[27:32.68]It went green for a second.
[27:37.16]Hello?
[27:42.03]Should I like wrap tinfoil around this thing?
[27:45.00]That might work.
[27:46.12]That works on my... We used to do that at my parents' house.
[27:51.09]We'll be right back.
[27:52.91]Just don't go anywhere.
[27:53.95]Look, I don't even care.
[27:54.77]You can just keep the TV on.
[28:34.68]Okay.
[28:37.25]So I shipped all my stuff.
[28:38.79]So all I have is some, like, foil pans.
[28:58.30]Actual ghost.
[29:00.50]I'm trying to get the fucking internet to work, okay?
[29:03.47]I don't care about your ghosts.
[29:06.69]I need to wrap this in foil.
[29:16.97]Okay.
[29:18.17]Now I've got to elevate this.
[29:19.17]I've got to get elevation on it.
[29:24.09]Oh, I don't... There's too many cords.
[29:27.89]Alright, is it working?
[29:33.52]If I tilt like this way, does it work?
[29:36.04]Let me know when you get a good signal, honey.
[29:38.32]Let me know when you get a good signal, honey.
[29:52.71]Don't move, don't move.
[29:53.47]I'm not going to move.
[29:57.94]It's fixed.
[29:58.60]I just can't move.
[30:04.24]Okay, I can't move.
[30:05.58]I just can't move.
[30:06.23]I told you the fucking foil was gonna work.
[30:14.07]Shit!
[30:14.31]It didn't work.
[30:17.21]And today, for you, I have a lobster ravioli!
[30:34.61]Alright, where's the clip of the ghost?
[30:38.21]Let me see my haunted house.
[30:41.21]I want to watch it.
[30:41.91]I'm curious.
[30:47.66]Ghost on stream.
[31:00.18]That's just me.
[31:04.87]I don't understand.
[31:09.57]That's just me.
[31:14.70]It's behind you.
[31:19.36]There's no gnome.
[31:20.50]There's no gnome in this.
[31:21.70]It's a Twitch clip.
[31:24.40]Right now.
[31:25.08]Watch out for the ghost.
[31:35.08]Look out!
[31:35.38]There's a ghost behind you!
[31:36.58]Oh, is there?
[31:37.08]There's like something weird back there, though.
[31:41.07]Do you notice that?
[31:42.45]There's like a little shadowy figure?
[31:44.49]Maybe that's what you guys are talking about.
[32:04.38]What the fuck did he just say to you?
[32:17.53]Did I fly up yet?
[32:33.26]That's good.
[32:39.02]What else am I gonna do here?
[32:40.14]Did you get that walk?
[33:00.64]I can just hear this in my head.
[33:03.30]I should just keep this on.
[33:06.59]Why not just keep it on in the background?
[33:08.09]Give us some fucking music.
[33:18.66]Reenact L.A.
[33:19.40]Noire.
[33:21.44]Am I on drugs?
[33:22.66]No.
[33:25.96]No.
[33:26.86]No.
[33:27.44]Not at all.
[33:29.00]You know what's funny?
[33:29.96]People are probably like, holy shit, man.
[33:32.08]Dude's probably on shrooms right now.
[33:33.92]No.
[33:34.26]Nothing.
[33:34.68]Nothing at all.
[33:35.30]Zero.
[33:37.10]I mean, I had like a fucking Tylenol like six hours ago.
[33:44.22]What's the red thing behind me?
[33:48.16]I'm not going to unplug it again.
[33:52.58]This thing?
[33:53.52]This thing over here?
[33:54.70]This thing right here?
[33:56.04]This thing?
[33:59.46]Keep away the bugs!
[34:04.20]I've gone off the deep end at this point.
[34:10.86]He's high.
[34:13.40]Oh yeah, you want to know what he drank today?
[34:15.63]Dude, he's wicked fucked up.
[34:18.11]You understand?
[34:18.87]Look at that.
[34:20.57]Yo, what was in there?
[34:22.15]What the fuck was in here?
[34:25.45]Who knows?
[34:26.29]Maybe there was some cucumber, apple, orange, spinach, and celery.
[34:35.75]It's not a piss bottle.
[34:36.96]No, it is now.
[34:50.42]That's not what P sounds like.
[35:02.26]The red thing in front of... What red thing?
[35:07.59]Oh.
[35:09.85]It's a... It's red sheets.
[35:14.57]And then behind that is the... When we played Hangman that one time.
[35:22.67]Those are sheets.
[35:23.51]Those are bed sheets.
[35:27.84]Prove it.
[35:29.72]You want to prove that there's bed sheets in there.
[35:33.48]Why do I have to do that?
[35:40.52]There's a red ghost in there.
[35:44.70]Blood-soaked sheets.
[35:46.11]No, I'm not opening that up.
[35:50.29]I'm not opening that up at all.
[35:52.80]It's backed up and it's away.
[35:58.44]It's a square ghost.
[36:03.45]Ugh.
[36:16.09]Killed the ghost.
[36:16.77]I got rid of the ghost for you guys.
[36:18.07]Except I missed.
[36:21.35]I gotta fucking sell this house.
[36:22.65]Stop making me do dirty things.
[36:26.71]Fuck.
[36:35.02]I'll show you.
[36:55.81]I ripped a piece off for you so you can see my bed sheet.
[36:59.53]It's long, so I can do it.
[37:01.71]See, it's a nice soft bed sheet.
[37:07.07]That's what it is.
[37:14.25]See?
[37:14.99]Imagine this is over up over your stomach like this.
[37:17.11]It's a sheet.
[37:20.55]It's good material.
[37:21.38]It's made out of good material.
[37:24.24]Soft, flexible.
[37:29.95]Ghost only mode.
[37:38.55]Am I going to play video games or not?
[37:41.21]Why don't you ask Comcast?
[37:44.08]Because they're the ones preventing it from happening.
[37:51.10]In fact, let me switch off of this right now.
[37:53.74]Defective, I can keep the title.
[37:57.18]I don't even know how much longer I'm going to be streaming.
[38:01.38]This is so stupid.
[38:02.68]Don't get... No.
[38:06.40]Don't get angry at this.
[38:10.72]I've got way too much going on.
[38:12.94]And way too much shit to be, like, upset.
[38:16.18]I've got... There's a lot of stress, a lot of shit going on.
[38:18.34]I can't... Gotta stay relaxed.
[38:26.25]Don't do it!
[38:26.83]Don't do it!
[38:34.89]play Minesweeper?
[38:35.55]I don't know how to play Minesweeper.
[38:39.63]Why do I have Comcast though?
[38:40.73]Because I live in an area, especially in Massachusetts, where we don't want any competition here.
[38:48.46]Comcast is the only option.
[38:51.22]It's really great for business.
[38:54.70]When you only have one fucking ISP that has download and upload over 20.
[39:00.78]It's great for fucking business.
[39:02.58]It's really good.
[39:15.61]Let's just have a staring contest.
[39:19.99]How could I even judge that?
[39:21.51]I can't even do that.
[39:22.39]Tell a story?
[39:25.81]I don't have... I'm too muddled up here.
[39:29.81]I'll tell you a story.
[39:31.80]No, I can't.
[39:32.46]I'm currently using that to prop up the TV.
[39:36.78]Play ping pong?
[39:39.70]What am I going to play ping pong with?
[39:41.22]I don't have a ping pong table.
[39:42.36]I don't have a ping pong ball.
[39:43.34]I don't have a ping pong paddle.
[39:47.01]What can I use?
[39:49.82]Run around on all fours.
[39:51.72]I'm not going to run around on all fours.
[40:02.39]Do you understand how embarrassing that is?
[40:07.59]I don't want that to be able to be clipped and sent to me forever.
[40:15.24]Do jumping jacks?
[40:17.79]No, I'm not doing that.
[40:22.95]Do or I'm gonna leave?
[40:25.53]Thanks for coming.
[40:28.39]Thanks for hanging out!
[40:31.53]Run up the stairs on all fours.
[40:32.91]I can do that.
[40:33.73]No, I'm not gonna do that!
[40:35.43]I'm not going to do that!
[40:39.35]Slide down the stairs.
[40:40.45]You want me to make like a sled and go down the stairs?
[40:45.93]What am I gonna use for a sled?
[40:49.14]You know, I could probably use the... I could probably use the bed sheet.
[40:54.72]That might actually be possible.
[40:55.68]That might actually be easy.
[40:58.16]Use the whiteboard.
[40:59.98]No, there's like fucking nails in there.
[41:01.42]Let me examine that.
[41:02.14]Hold on.
[41:08.18]No, it looks like I could probably do it on this.
[41:30.78]Sorry again.
[41:32.88]Come on, man.
[41:40.18]I'm not using that.
[41:45.60]What's up here?
[41:53.39]Nothing in there.
[41:56.37]Nothing in there to use.
[42:21.29]Nothing in there.
[42:25.60]Browse the subreddit.
[42:26.56]No, I don't want to browse the subreddit.
[42:29.68]Let's just make like a fucking dinosaur out of clay.
[42:31.88]I don't have any clay because nothing's in here.
[42:34.30]No, I don't...
[42:52.40]Smash up the Labo host?
[42:53.44]It's already gone.
[42:58.24]Play rock, paper, scissors.
[42:59.28]Okay, we can do that.
[43:05.85]Ready?
[43:08.05]Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
[43:11.77]I won.
[43:13.55]First person that wrote something was paper, and I won.
[43:23.95]It's tied.
[43:27.41]First, hold on a second.
[43:28.13]Somebody gave money.
[43:29.67]Somebody gave a lot of money.
[43:31.45]Ellen Noir gave $55 like 20 minutes ago.
[43:36.88]No message, just cheer $5,500.
[43:40.38]Thank you for the $55 fucking dollars in bits, dude.
[43:43.02]Thank you so much.
[43:45.97]Take the shirt off.
[43:47.23]My fucking mic.
[43:50.95]Take... What the...
[43:55.08]What is that?
[43:55.80]What is this on me?
[43:56.82]This is fucking a ghost ectoplasm.
[44:08.73]There is a ghost in here.
[44:10.51]He slimed me.
[44:22.35]I didn't say anything.
[44:23.34]You didn't hear anything.
[44:25.48]I actually kind of like this little microphone.
[44:28.50]Right?
[44:29.56]I like it.
[44:30.20]It's fun.
[44:30.62]There's a spider in here somewhere probably.
[44:35.48]I probably ran it over when I was doing the fucking sick sled move that you guys just saw.
[44:43.64]Do a ghost hunt stream.
[44:47.80]I got shit in these closets.
[44:50.91]Here's like my paint cans.
[44:52.77]That's embarrassing.
[44:55.12]I don't want you to see that shit.
[44:57.72]You know what I mean?
[44:58.28]Like, oh, look, this is the paint, the color of the paint cans that he has in his basement.
[45:02.64]Oh, cringe.
[45:03.90]You know what I mean?
[45:04.36]I don't want that.
[45:11.59]I can't do a house tour, guys.
[45:19.01]The camera doesn't go that far.
[45:20.19]I would need four people to lift it up.
[45:29.73]Is that... Did you see how this just scraped my nose?
[45:39.11]We're trying to do anything right now.
[45:42.51]I've been trying to kill time here for like a fucking hour almost.
[45:46.76]And it's still not working.
[45:53.22]Oh yeah, it's off.
[45:57.62]What happens if I do this?
[45:59.72]Can you guys hear my stomach?
[46:02.28]Do you want me to do an endoscopy?
[46:05.20]Let's see if you guys can hear inside my esophagus.
[46:17.29]Could you hear it?
[46:24.08]It was loud inside?
[46:25.04]Hold on.
[46:44.52]I hear screaming.
[46:48.59]I hear screaming.
[46:59.67]Ears are dead.
[47:00.39]Really?
[47:00.71]I turned it down so low, too.
[47:02.99]I'm so sorry.
[47:03.69]Blame... Blame Comcast!
[47:14.72]Are we good?
[47:15.48]Are we at a good quality now?
[47:19.32]It was gross.
[47:20.44]It probably was.
[47:24.96]How was my birthday?
[47:26.83]It was pretty sick.
[47:28.47]You know, it was pretty cool.
[47:30.35]Turned a number and then I got a card.
[47:33.17]That's it.
[47:44.45]that let's play a game let's play a game called what president are you from like the side profile what president am I Lincoln Grover Cleveland I saw Grover Cleveland
[48:15.39]Yeah, I could be a pretty good Lincoln, I think, from this angle.
[48:20.21]Lincoln had a full bald head, right?
[48:24.62]No, Lincoln had a ponytail, right?
[48:27.36]So Lincoln had a bun ponytail up here.
[48:31.50]And he had these long eyebrows that went down to here.
[48:36.79]Like that.
[48:39.23]And this was a little long, too, down here as well.
[48:41.07]This came all the way down to his neck.
[48:52.03]So, NA education.
[48:59.12]I know what Abraham Lincoln looks like.
[49:00.42]I can close my eyes and see him.
[49:04.94]Big eyes up here.
[49:06.78]Two big eyes.
[49:09.32]Blue fur.
[49:10.08]Got blue fur all over him.
[49:11.22]His mouth opens like this.
[49:14.42]He's got the no nose.
[49:16.56]And he's eating cookies.
[49:19.69]Eating cookies, a lot of them.
[49:22.11]Right?
[49:22.29]Okay.
[49:25.09]No, that's right.
[49:32.59]No, yeah, that's correct.
[49:34.25]I just closed my eyes and that's what I saw.
[49:37.13]I can easily name him.
[49:47.64]Do some quizzes.
[49:49.62]I'm not prepared to do any quizzes.
[49:51.56]I'm just going to go rage eat.
[49:54.10]You know what I mean?
[49:56.45]I'm going to go just rage eat.
[49:59.01]No, I'm not supposed to be angry about this.
[50:02.09]I have a lot of work to do.
[50:03.61]I've got so much work to do.
[50:08.17]Alright, we'll do a BuzzFeed quiz.
[50:11.03]I'm just going to go to the first one that's there.
[50:15.31]We've got to keep this camera angle because I can't even unplug my fucking PlayStation 4.
[50:18.25]Okay, I'm typing into Google.
[50:25.81]BuzzFeed quiz.
[50:28.25]And I don't even care what the first one is.
[50:30.19]This is the one we're going to do.
[50:33.05]Okay, take this.
[50:33.89]It's a pizza quiz.
[50:34.95]Take this pizza quiz and we'll reveal your mental and actual age.
[50:42.83]Okay, hold on a minute.
[50:43.70]Let me get this on screen.
[50:45.76]We're going to do a pizza quiz.
[50:51.48]Let's see if they can get it.
[50:52.30]Go like this.
[50:56.23]Let me just get it on the stream.
[51:02.83]Window capture.
[51:06.37]Okay, pizza quiz.
[51:07.45]There it is.
[51:07.89]I'm just going to drag this up.
[51:14.60]They're going to get my age here.
[51:16.22]They're going to get my mental age and my physical age, apparently.
[51:20.30]Somehow.
[51:22.48]Let me make sure you can see this.
[51:25.96]Oops.
[51:29.23]This goes this way.
[51:30.69]Alright, there we go.
[51:33.07]That's good over here.
[51:38.77]I'm going to make it so you can still see me.
[51:40.51]Because I'm the star!
[51:44.00]Let's minimize that.
[51:44.78]Alright.
[51:46.30]So let's see here.
[51:47.01]I got to pick my favorite pizza.
[51:50.59]We got meat lovers, seafood.
[51:53.57]Who the fuck is ordering seafood on their pizza?
[51:57.34]What's on there?
[51:59.52]There's like dinosaur feet on here.
[52:03.46]No, absolutely not.
[52:10.19]supreme I don't what is supreme no meat lovers there's no meat on here barbecue chicken mmm close pepperoni that's pretty good but who the who the fuck was put who put the olives on there there are black olives on here disgusting I'm not clicking on that because there's black olives on it sausage and red onion no none of these
[52:38.79]I mean, maybe the pepperoni, but I can't click it because there's olives on it.
[52:42.07]Alright, if I scrape... Pepperoni.
[52:44.57]If I scrape off... I'm going to scrape off the olives.
[52:47.39]Now pick among these pizzas.
[52:52.32]Alright, this one was drawn in paint.
[52:58.76]That one... That one... That part didn't care.
[53:02.44]These all look like shit.
[53:06.11]Is this a bread bowl soup or is that a pizza?
[53:11.70]This one looks good.
[53:13.46]This one.
[53:16.06]Pick two pizzas off the table.
[53:18.64]Alright, that's like eggs.
[53:20.79]These are two egg pizzas.
[53:22.11]Nobody wants eggs on... Why would you do that?
[53:24.17]That's not even pizza.
[53:26.69]That's a pecan pie.
[53:31.09]Um...
[53:34.10]I can't even see 1 and 2.
[53:35.24]They're too far away.
[53:36.02]How am I supposed to do this?
[53:41.44]1 and 10?
[53:41.94]No, I don't want the pecan pie.
[53:46.57]7 and 8.
[53:49.59]You're a weirdo if you pick that.
[53:51.23]You just are.
[53:53.27]Those of you in this chat that are like, man, 7 and 8, especially 8.
[53:55.99]I think you're a certified weirdo.
[53:59.11]Right?
[53:59.27]5 and 9.
[54:05.79]There's like mayonnaise on there.
[54:08.47]Three and six.
[54:11.52]No, that's a dessert.
[54:13.40]It's going to be one of those gotcha BuzzFeed things where it says, oh, it gotcha.
[54:17.94]You didn't know that those were all pies and desserts, mate.
[54:22.58]No.
[54:23.94]Two and four.
[54:27.85]No, that's a fucking, that's the inside of a kiwi.
[54:31.99]8 and 9.
[54:32.89]No, no.
[54:33.61]Where's 1?
[54:34.31]1 is the only thing that looks like a... 1 and 6 look like pizzas.
[54:40.62]1 and 6.
[54:41.10]There you go.
[54:41.72]That's my answer.
[54:43.32]How many slices of this pizza would you eat?
[54:47.75]How many slices would you eat if you ate pizza?
[54:52.93]This is kind of an embarrassing question, but...
[54:55.79]I usually eat the whole thing.
[54:58.09]I ate an entire fucking pizza when I ordered pizza.
[55:00.67]And I'll do it until I hurt myself.
[55:03.04]So... I'm going to have to go with the whole thing.
[55:07.06]I mean, well, maybe not.
[55:08.30]Let's be conservative about this.
[55:11.24]Six.
[55:11.74]One, two, three, four, five.
[55:12.90]Yeah.
[55:13.42]I will get to six.
[55:15.00]And then I'll go... Fuck.
[55:19.89]I should eat that one.
[55:21.53]I'm going to say six.
[55:24.14]Finally, choose the most appetizing drawing of a pizza.
[55:28.74]That looks alright.
[55:29.38]I don't like this bones in this one.
[55:34.22]I don't want the one with the bones.
[55:36.73]Plus, I'm going to go out on a limb here and I'm going to offend everybody in chat.
[55:39.07]You ready to get offended, everybody here?
[55:42.31]Are you ready?
[55:42.73]Are you ready to unsub this channel?
[55:47.45]Are you sure?
[55:50.11]Because pineapple on pizza is gross.
[55:52.53]I think I just lost half of you.
[55:53.64]I think all half of you just ran.
[56:02.69]I told you.
[56:04.59]Guys, that's more polarizing than if I told you I was like a Democrat or a Republican.
[56:11.43]but I thought it all you know I I'm a democrat no I mean it's a whatever and you know the idea of your entitled to your opinion and I don't think pineapple belongs on pizza coach okay let me explain let me explain what happened
[56:40.27]Oh, god damn it!
[56:44.02]Come here!
[56:50.66]Let me explain what happened.
[56:53.43]Alright, so, here's what happened.
[57:03.21]So, I was... I'm holding up the...
[57:13.87]Okay, look.
[57:15.91]Here's what happened.
[57:18.67]This TV is angled at a way where I can't see the screen.
[57:24.51]So I had to take MLB The Show 17 and Yakuza 0 were propping the TV up a little bit so I could fucking see because of the glare on the TV.
[57:36.84]I then tapped the fucking... I forgot that it was doing that so even a little bit of pressure would knock the TV over.
[57:42.24]TV's fine.
[57:43.91]We're good to go.
[57:46.41]We're fine.
[57:46.94]You can hear.
[57:47.32]Okay, could you guys not hear any of that?
[57:53.62]Let me repeat that.
[57:57.89]Look, okay, so here, I can repeat this.
[58:00.55]MLB The Show and Yakuza 0.
[58:03.62]These had to prop up the TV by, like, a half an inch.
[58:07.83]Because the TV is at an angle where I can't fucking see it.
[58:12.29]So I had to prop it up a little bit, which meant any, like, pressure would knock.
[58:16.01]And I punched the camera and it knocked the whole... Wouldn't have happened if I didn't have these here.
[58:20.55]The TV is fine.
[58:21.67]There's no problems.
[58:22.57]There's no damage.
[58:24.27]We're good to go.
[58:25.35]What the hell are we doing?
[58:28.45]I'm too quiet now?
[58:29.90]What?
[58:34.06]The mic is working.
[58:40.76]Is the stream... Oh, the stream is lagging.
[58:46.00]So are you saying that those are great games?
[58:49.27]Yeah, they're great.
[58:53.45]I didn't damage any items, okay?
[58:59.21]I gotta pick a pizza, right.
[59:00.33]I gotta pick a pizza.
[59:04.89]again.
[59:08.31]Anyways, pineapple is delicious on pizza.
[59:12.02]It's absolutely scrumptious.
[59:18.60]You changed.
[59:19.48]You damaged chat when you hit us.
[59:22.14]No, that was like the knee-jerk reaction.
[59:29.68]Alright, which one am I clicking on?
[59:34.50]There's candy canes on that one.
[59:35.62]I don't want that one.
[59:40.45]This one looks alright.
[59:48.76]This one.
[59:50.24]How do I click that one?
[59:51.80]There we go.
[59:58.27]You got... You're 20 and 40.
[60:02.16]Your mental age is 20, but you're actually 40.
[60:09.80]That's kind of accurate.
[60:11.52]That's pretty accurate.
[60:19.17]I knew it.
[60:25.69]You're on your way.
[60:26.82]Yeah, I am.
[60:29.67]That sounds about right.
[60:34.16]Mental age 12, actual 40.
[60:36.14]My mental age is 28.
[60:39.32]My physical age is 31.
[60:40.04]This thing is wrong.
[60:42.86]Let me tweet that.
[60:43.90]Why would you ever click this?
[60:47.98]Imagine clicking on that.
[60:52.94]Alright, well, now what?
[60:55.18]Now what?
[61:00.39]Cookies.
[61:01.51]Click it.
[61:01.83]I'm not clicking that.
[61:03.98]I don't even have Twitter linked up to here.
[61:08.70]Punch us again.
[61:09.60]No, I wasn't punching you guys.
[61:11.30]I was pretending to be somebody that received information about how pineapple and pizzas, and I was reflecting that to a political statement that I made previously, and that's more.
[61:20.91]Come on.
[61:25.38]I'm not clicking that link.
[61:31.23]It's fine, just play L.A.
[61:32.31]Noire.
[61:33.21]That's not fine.
[61:38.18]I refuse to believe it's fine.
[61:43.91]Wait, we got like 10 seconds here!
[61:50.81]Is it good?
[61:52.13]Are we actually... Can I actually play L.A.
[61:53.78]Noire?
[62:02.59]Nope.
[62:04.47]Nope.
[62:05.85]Oh, we just got jebaited.
[62:12.23]Tweet it, tweet it, tweet it.
[62:13.63]I'm not going to tweet it.
[62:25.60]In 10 seconds, you get to install.
[62:27.94]I know, really.
[62:31.21]Wait, where'd it go?
[62:32.25]Don't even tell me Windows Update is trying to turn this off.
[62:35.31]No, this computer has Windows 7.
[62:37.09]It's not going to do that.
[62:42.63]Tweet it or punch us.
[62:45.50]Why do you guys want me to punch you again?
[62:52.30]What's going on with the game?
[62:54.28]It's not.
[62:54.62]The game's not on.
[62:57.14]Well, here's the deal, guys.
[63:02.05]I gave it a solid hour and 40 minutes.
[63:11.43]I don't think it's going to happen tonight.
[63:15.41]Unfortunately.
[63:17.80]So what we're going to do is we're going to just try again tomorrow.
[63:25.05]Do it anyway.
[63:25.79]No, I can't.
[63:26.73]Look, we can do these, like, shitty streams where I just, like, eat the fucking microphone and, like, diarrhea on my steps.
[63:32.53]Like, I can do that, like, with this shit internet.
[63:35.47]But to play a game like L.A.
[63:37.32]Noire, I want to experience it.
[63:38.50]I don't want it to be, like, a shitty fucking glitchy piece of crap on screen.
[63:42.48]I want it to be enjoyable.
[63:48.62]I can't play Oblivion.
[63:49.68]I can't play any game like this.
[63:52.14]It's just... That's unwatchable.
[63:56.66]Don't poo on the stream.
[63:58.84]No, I'm using diarrhea-ing as a verb.
[64:02.04]Right?
[64:04.08]Like, diarrhea-ing.
[64:05.18]Like, I diarrhea-ed on stream.
[64:06.82]That could mean anything.
[64:07.68]That could mean I fell, I... Like, I punched something.
[64:12.32]You know, like, I'm a puncher.
[64:14.49]I'm not even a puncher.
[64:15.51]And, like, somebody's gonna share that clip, and it's gonna be like, oh, this dude punches shit.
[64:18.65]Like, I don't... That's the first time I've ever done that.
[64:20.79]That's the first time I've ever punched anything.
[64:23.65]I think I get a pass because of the Comcast shit.
[64:26.98]I'm not a punch person.
[64:27.98]I'm a non-violent person.
[64:36.30]I thought someone just said, tweet your teeth.
[64:43.55]But anyways, for the purposes of not dragging out waiting for this to work,
[64:56.22]I'm probably going to call it a night here.
[65:00.12]Because this is just stupid.
[65:03.56]It has not gotten any better.
[65:04.94]I tried to give it about two fucking hours and it's just not working.
[65:11.50]Can you guys close your nostrils when you do that?
[65:13.98]I can't.
[65:22.35]Okay, I just got like a headache.
[65:27.26]One more punch for the road?
[65:29.14]No.
[65:29.98]I don't want to break anything.
[65:32.22]I don't want to break this TV.
[65:34.46]You know what I mean?
[65:37.29]I definitely, under no circumstance, want to break this TV.
[65:42.59]Because it's like hanging by a thread.
[65:45.71]Like, I can't.
[65:52.88]Just one more.
[65:53.74]Alright, fine.
[65:54.33]You want me to do... No, no, no.
[65:55.77]I'm not doing that.
[65:56.53]I'm not a punch person.
[65:57.55]I'm not like a smasher or a crasher.

[73:00.59]Thank you.
[73:02.05]Thank you also to Greasy Striga for the $1.
[73:04.45]Gee, thanks for asking me how awesome my birthday was.
[73:06.39]It was great, by the way.
[73:07.27]Geez.
[73:09.75]Happy birthday.
[73:10.87]And happy birthday to me, too.
[73:11.89]It was both of our birthdays.
[73:12.78]Isn't that cool?
[73:13.86]That people can have the same... Did you know... You guys know that you can have the same birthday as somebody else?
[73:18.48]How weird is that?
[73:20.40]That means that me and that person were both born at the exact same time.
[73:23.68]At the same day.
[73:25.73]That's weird, isn't it?
[73:32.39]But thank you.
[73:32.83]Thank you, Tara Alacrin, for the $1 play.
[73:35.01]20 questions with chat.
[73:35.85]We go first.
[73:39.81]No.
[73:40.93]Greasy Streaker, thanks for the $1.
[73:42.29]Seriously, I'm glad to hear your birthday was good.
[73:43.85]The move will be all over soon and life will be normal again post-Comcast.
[73:48.45]Oh, I'm looking forward to it.
[73:49.87]I can't wait till that happens.
[73:53.39]I'm going to go rage eat like a double cheeseburger.
[73:55.60]Two of them.
[73:56.90]I'm not supposed to be doing that.
[73:59.04]Comcast is making me do that.
[74:02.34]but thank you dude thank you I am monk for the one dollar streamer kills chat with pizza rage no that was that was not me that was an I was putting on an act as a thespian I was putting on an act and showing you you know what we are what if so what if scenario you know of what if make you think makes you think about make you think about scenario
[74:34.76]Thank you, though.
[74:38.30]Did you have any off-screen adventures with Stirr during the great hiatus of 2017?
[74:41.70]No.
[74:42.42]We hung out at one of the conventions, but that was it.
[74:49.19]Nothing really that interesting.
[74:51.63]Thank you, though, dude.
[74:52.27]Thank you, Zol Nogue, for the $1.
[74:54.94]Mr. Destructoid, thanks, dude.

[75:05.49]Cheese Block, thanks for the bits.
[75:07.57]Thank you.
[75:10.29]Tar Alecron again, thanks for the $1.
[75:11.69]Considering you have any... Considering you have computer problems every other week, have you thought about prepping a bunch of Plan Bs ready for when the internet is rough like today?
[75:28.50]Not really, because the internet is the only way I can communicate with you guys.
[75:32.52]You know what I mean?
[75:34.74]If my internet cannot even be 500k up or 100k up, there is no plan B. Every plan is based around if the internet is going to work at least a considerable level.
[75:49.26]You know what I mean?
[75:50.40]There's no way I can even stream.
[75:52.60]There are no plan Bs without the foundation.
[76:00.55]We'll try again tomorrow.
[76:02.87]But thank you.
[76:04.58]Not much longer of this bullshit.
[76:05.86]Don't worry.
[76:06.78]Only a couple more weeks.
[76:08.76]Pyroblasted, thanks for the $1.
[76:10.31]Hey man, how about a kick?
[76:11.33]Can we get a kick?
[76:12.05]I'm not kicking anything.
[76:14.19]I already like punched the webcam off and almost destroyed the television.
[76:17.21]I'm not doing that.
[76:18.47]No kicks.
[76:19.80]But thank you.
[76:21.00]And finally, at the end here, thank you, Snooze and Copter, for the $1.
[76:23.46]Hey, Jerma, happy belated birthday, first of all.
[76:25.44]And now, I'm really excited for the move, not just for the internet, but for all the opportunities that you'll open in your path.
[76:31.99]Me too.
[76:33.05]Like, seriously, without forcing you to do, without forcing you to, I do expect great things from you once you settle there.
[76:39.14]I wish you all the best.
[76:39.86]Seriously, it's going to be great.
[76:41.14]New era.
[76:42.20]Love you.
[76:44.48]I'm looking forward to it.
[76:47.28]That's when the can of worms gets to open.
[76:51.16]You'll see lots of things that I've been talking about for the last couple of years will start to happen in the next, like, six months.
[76:59.10]Sooner than that.
[77:03.13]Thank you, guys.
[77:05.39]And that is all the bits.
[77:09.73]Oh, wait.
[77:10.05]No, it's not.
[77:10.73]Because, oh, wait a minute.
[77:12.35]I, like, turned the stream off, like, 60 times.
[77:18.17]They're not even here.
[77:19.94]No, they would be here.
[77:22.06]No, they would be here.
[77:25.28]I don't see anything on the dashboard unless it got cut off somehow.
[77:29.66]The VODs.
[77:32.56]Oh, the fucking VODs.
[77:34.74]Oh my god, what am I going to do?
[77:36.95]Those VODs are going to be unbearable.
[77:49.80]I'm going to have to check on that after the stream because that might be... That might be like 32 VODs.
[77:54.49]I hear a turkey.
[78:18.26]It's a pretty weird turkey.
[78:21.62]Anyways, see you later, guys.
[78:25.10]Take care.
[78:25.56]Have a good night.
[78:27.16]See you soon.
[78:29.26]And goodbye.
[78:33.38]See you tomorrow.
[78:38.44]There's no outro screen, by the way.
