[00:00.75]But anyways.
[00:03.75]We're going to move on from there.
[00:06.22]Oh, it's blue.
[00:06.70]Sorry.
[00:11.38]I apologize for the blue.
[00:14.58]We're going to transition here to the slot game.
[00:18.79]Coming up is Jeremiah's Slots.
[00:21.91]This is the community game.
[00:29.87]Let me change the title.
[00:34.49]This was made by CAD.
[00:37.26]And I'll tell you, actually Rage Quit, I can't.
[00:40.82]We got other things to do today.
[00:49.62]And by the way, this game is gonna just be downloadable on Steam for free, just a free game.
[00:57.46]I did not have anything to officially do with this.
[01:00.24]This is just something somebody made.
[01:02.68]And it was really, really interesting, really cool.
[01:06.15]And I wanted to try it.
[01:07.71]It looks pretty elaborate.
[01:11.35]I've been told it takes about an hour or two to complete the whole thing, depending on how lucky you are.
[01:15.73]And we're going to find out.
[01:31.96]So I don't know what to expect, but I'm sure it'll be interesting.
[01:34.96]This is Jerma Slots.
[01:40.87]Let me just open it.
[01:41.53]Okay.
[01:52.41]Here we go.
[01:53.03]There it is.
[02:00.44]Please read!
[02:10.80]The slot machine in this game has several winning three-of-a-kind combinations.
[02:15.06]Each combination has a special event tied to it.
[02:19.76]If you want to see an event without naturally spinning a winning combination, hit escape, go to the pause menu, and check the enable cheats box.
[02:28.14]A cheat drop-down will become active under that box.
[02:30.28]Select the winning combination from that menu and the next spin will give you that combination.
[02:34.77]Okay.
[02:36.77]Most events will occur only once.
[02:39.25]Restarting the game resets all events.
[02:42.15]Click on my face to begin.
[02:43.63]David Bowie seriously suck-a-fod out of my ass.
[02:48.22]It's a toilet, you know what I mean?
[02:52.50]What do you got against David Bowie?
[03:03.61]Here's my old intro from, like, 2011.
[03:06.65]Alright, that was quite the intro.
[03:19.10]Here it is.
[03:19.48]Here's the venue.
[03:20.04]Here's the options.
[03:22.20]Let's take a look.
[03:22.94]Resolution, full screen, graphics, full.
[03:26.82]Intro is on.
[03:27.70]Okay.
[03:28.96]There it is.
[03:33.54]I have no idea what to expect.
[03:34.61]I'm looking forward to this.
[03:36.59]This is not out yet.
[03:39.83]This will be able to be downloaded after this stream is over.
[03:45.53]Potentially even Monday.
[03:47.98]Because Steam... I'm not sure you can... There's a release schedule thing.
[03:52.44]It might be on Monday.
[03:55.16]So I got a free... I got a press copy of this game.
[03:58.10]Just want to make sure everyone knows this key was provided to me.
[04:04.96]I'm ready.
[04:05.30]Let's see how this works.
[04:12.75]So I can look around?
[04:14.01]Is this a- is it W-A-S-D?
[04:23.44]Oh, you dick.
[04:31.53]Press E to kill!
[04:33.55]You just really... You're killing me here.
[04:36.85]Can I do anything else?
[04:37.55]Can I interact with something?
[04:38.33]Can I jump?
[04:44.90]That's a cool... Okay, let's give myself a boost.
[04:48.80]Let me look at the stickers.
[04:59.28]What are these ones?
[05:00.98]It's Jex.
[05:03.56]Slug.
[05:04.38]Asteroid.
[05:04.80]Oh, these are the emotes.
[05:05.61]That's awesome.
[05:06.19]Alright, how much money do I get?
[05:09.31]This is so cool.
[05:16.71]Press these keys to bet and spin.
[05:19.59]Press E to buy more bald coins.
[05:24.18]Okay.
[05:25.52]Let me turn it up a little.
[05:28.18]How many ball coins do I have?
[05:31.85]What did I just put in?
[05:34.75]I put in a $25 bill?
[05:36.07]Alright, here we go.
[05:38.99]So, I'm gonna do... Let's spin.
[05:45.98]How many... We can max bet this thing, right?
[05:51.62]It's nothing.
[05:52.56]So this rat, glue man, my face...
[05:59.30]Two rats.
[06:00.60]How much down am I?
[06:01.44]16 bald coins?
[06:01.96]I can't hit anything!
[06:25.75]Oh, you can hold, wait, hold, wait, I need the instructions.
[06:32.25]F1, F2, F3.
[06:33.71]E is interact, okay, so F1, F2, F3.
[06:41.16]If the player has enough money, they may hold up to two of the three wheels in order to increase their odds for a winning combination.
[06:46.04]A player can unhold held wheels by pressing the same button again.
[06:49.92]The cost per wheel increases depending on the bet amount.
[06:53.28]Okay.
[06:53.48]It costs 10 bitcoins per wheel!
[06:56.55]That's like $50,000!
[06:58.03]That's not good enough for me.
[07:13.87]I'm out of money.
[07:17.71]Free rats!
[07:18.43]Where the rats?
[07:22.09]We pray at night, we stalk at night.
[07:24.67]Where the rats?
[07:27.21]I'm the giant rat.
[07:28.91]Holy shit.
[07:31.22]Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.
[07:37.66]What is that worth?
[07:38.66]Five bucks?
[07:40.68]That was awesome.
[07:41.84]That was only five dollars!
[07:45.58]I need more... How do I... I need to put more money in.
[07:48.26]No, I want... We're gonna do it again.
[07:51.07]Spin.
[07:51.45]Okay, hold the rats.
[07:52.29]What?
[07:52.53]Press E to... Life is pain!
[07:54.01]I hate...
[08:10.74]There's bits on there, by the way.
[08:13.24]So that's... Alright, that's 50 bucks.
[08:19.69]Max bet.
[08:27.87]Glue man, glue man.
[08:28.69]Alright, hold the glue man's, right?
[08:30.51]Hold the glue man's.
[08:33.31]What, I can't?
[08:34.15]I can only hold one of the glue man's?
[08:35.81]Is it because my bet's too high?
[08:37.87]It's 10!
[08:38.63]God damn, I need more money!
[08:41.97]I can't hold, I need to, I got a max bet.
[08:44.41]I'm sorry, I have to.
[08:51.85]I can't, no, I can't, lower the bet?
[08:53.35]What if I just, what if I do one instead?
[08:56.14]Okay, I can hold it with one.
[08:57.24]Glue Man.
[09:00.58]Yes!
[09:04.24]Glue Man wants to fight.
[09:07.80]Fight, item, Jerma, run, item.
[09:14.51]Alright, let's go with, uh, let's go with Fight.
[09:18.00]Elbow Drop Jex Mode.
[09:20.32]This is Attack Wrestling.
[09:23.32]Buff Legend.
[09:24.40]Presto Majesto is a debuff.
[09:27.86]Fake Stave.
[09:28.52]Attack, that's sweet.
[09:32.87]Super effective.
[09:34.89]The man uses Chokeslam.
[09:36.27]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[09:39.55]This is awesome.
[09:40.99]Do I have any items?
[09:42.17]Pure cholesterol.
[09:43.45]Old pizza.
[09:46.03]Fully heals me.
[09:47.45]Heals Jerma for a moderate amount.
[09:49.60]Fully restores all of Jerma's abilities.
[09:51.52]Cooking wine.
[09:54.24]Iced coffee.
[09:54.80]Fully restores one of Jerma's abilities.
[09:57.48]I don't think... I don't need these yet.
[09:59.60]What does this mean?
[10:00.77]You have no Jermas left.
[10:03.95]Okay, what about Prestum Majestum?
[10:09.80]I missed it.
[10:11.46]God damn it.
[10:14.20]I'm gonna have to start eating pizza.
[10:16.90]Alright, what is Jex mode?
[10:21.00]Okay, let's try Jex.
[10:22.12]Jeremy uses Jex mode.
[10:25.06]Women use Hail Mary, and he missed.
[10:27.50]So I got +2 here.
[10:29.24]Alright, and now I want to do elbow drop.
[10:31.99]No, no, back step.
[10:33.17]Alright, good.
[10:40.46]Dermot can't move.
[10:42.26]I'm gonna use a showboat.
[10:43.40]I have a wealth of +2.
[10:48.26]Shit, he's gonna kill me.
[10:49.89]A crit!
[10:50.39]That's a critical hit?
[10:53.41]Alright, I need to eat something.
[10:55.89]I still can't move?
[10:57.89]I gotta heal.
[11:03.22]Old pizza.
[11:04.72]Dermot digs an old pizza out of his bag and eats it.
[11:13.88]Alright, shell boat is worn off.
[11:15.24]I think I'm alright still.
[11:16.02]Let's fight.
[11:18.82]What is, uh... Elbow drop pressed over chest, oh.
[11:23.98]What's this dude's name?
[11:25.76]It's Deepa.
[11:28.26]Confused.
[11:28.92]Glue man is mesmerized.
[11:30.90]Good.
[11:31.10]Now we're gonna backstab.
[11:35.20]Okay, mesmerized still, right?
[11:37.23]Yup.
[11:44.55]Blue Man shakes off the magic and uses Show Boat.
[11:49.70]I'm gonna, I'm gonna, uh... Knock him out.
[11:51.12]Damn it.
[11:52.36]Bonding Agent.
[11:53.12]I need to heal.
[11:53.94]Elbow Drop.

[12:10.75]Drinks Wrestle Sweat.
[12:12.49]Chokeslam has been restored.
[12:14.11]Uh-oh.
[12:15.75]I need to eat pizza again.
[12:24.12]Shit.
[12:27.38]This is gonna say it's level 99.
[12:30.62]He's a higher level than me.
[12:31.66]That's not fair.
[12:33.02]You have no Germans.
[12:42.38]Alright, it worked.
[12:45.34]Now, what about ice, coffee, abilities, pure cholesterol?
[12:48.78]No.
[12:49.72]He's confused, so let's go again.
[12:50.88]Let's do, try elbow drop.
[12:52.65]I want to land this.
[12:54.91]It's not very effective, so we gotta do back, but he's still confused.
[12:59.59]We're gonna have to go back, we're gonna have to go backstab again.
[13:07.51]Nice.
[13:07.69]Alright, keep him confused.
[13:13.78]Can I do it again?
[13:15.10]Do it again.
[13:16.26]Keep him in a constant state.
[13:23.68]Again.
[13:25.79]Shit.
[13:28.93]I need to use an item.
[13:31.65]Cooking wine.
[13:32.31]Fully restores one of my abilities.
[13:35.75]All abilities are restored.
[13:42.58]Shit, uh, Presto Magesto again.
[13:48.84]No, god damn it.
[13:52.23]He's gonna kill me.
[13:57.45]Presto Magesto Jex Mode, then Backstab.
[14:03.75]What happens if I die?
[14:16.54]Critical hit.
[14:17.12]Look at that health drop.
[14:18.14]Do it again.
[14:20.66]He's still confused.
[14:21.24]I can do it again.
[14:25.43]Crit.
[14:25.65]Again.
[14:26.21]Pretty close.
[14:28.55]Still mesmerized.
[14:29.17]Again.
[14:29.37]Hit it!
[14:29.63]Yes!
[14:58.61]He's still confused, I need to heal.
[15:03.27]Uh, eat another, eat another pizza.
[15:07.24]We're good?
[15:09.88]I might be able to end it right here.
[15:12.58]Let's see, how many do I have?
[15:13.46]I've got two more press to hit.
[15:14.46]Uh oh.
[15:19.75]No!
[15:20.33]No!
[15:27.73]Shit!
[15:30.57]Oh no.
[15:31.59]I- at this point if it's- I- It's a race now.
[16:02.66]This is never gonna end.
[16:06.25]No, not a full heal yet.
[16:07.35]Not until I desperately need it.
[16:08.65]Stop eating pizza?
[16:11.69]No, back it up here.
[16:13.97]Alright, here we go.
[16:17.07]Give me a crit.
[16:33.34]Bring it down.
[16:34.98]Stay, yeah, still confused.
[16:37.68]What do we got for item?
[16:40.62]Uh, I have to do... I have to ice coffee it again.
[16:43.47]Good.
[16:43.95]Give war off card again.
[16:46.41]Yep.
[17:12.94]One more of those.
[17:13.99]Stay confused.
[17:14.97]Yes!
[17:18.75]Again.
[17:19.07]Yes!
[17:20.67]He's so close.
[17:24.09]Yes!
[17:32.08]No!
[17:33.00]Don't heal.
[17:34.28]Oh god dammit.
[17:35.96]What?
[17:42.88]Oh my god.
[17:46.50]No.
[17:47.22]That sucks.
[17:48.00]What happens if I lose?
[17:49.56]Do I die?
[18:11.85]I got greedy.
[18:12.65]What was I supposed to do?
[18:14.57]I had to try.
[18:17.36]Don't worry, I'm gonna crit it twice.
[18:19.88]It is one.
[18:22.74]Come on, hit again.
[18:29.46]I'm fine.
[18:32.40]Everything's fine.
[18:32.78]He's still confused.
[18:34.84]Okay, it wore off.
[18:37.20]We have to try this again and then I have to use... How much more cooking wine do I have?
[18:43.58]I only have one more cooking wine.
[18:49.14]Wait, wait.
[18:49.84]I'm gonna use the cooking wine.
[18:52.84]I still have my food.
[18:53.43]Here we go.
[18:54.95]Presto Majesto.
[18:57.19]Jacks.
[19:18.60]Mesmerized.
[19:20.94]I need to get, like, three or four crits here.
[19:23.36]Do it again.
[19:25.66]Stay there.
[19:26.02]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[19:30.26]Again.
[19:31.90]That's a big one.
[19:32.46]That's a big.
[19:34.10]That's a big one.
[19:34.64]I only get to do this one more time.
[19:35.74]Stay.
[19:37.05]Be still confused.
[19:37.97]Okay.
[19:39.85]Here we go.
[19:40.55]Prestum Adjuster has worn off.
[19:43.79]Should I do...
[19:52.71]What?
[19:53.09]Wait, what?
[19:53.65]He still... He still has health?
[19:56.82]Hold on.
[19:57.20]Wait, wait, wait.
[20:01.70]Oh, no.
[20:02.78]No!
[20:03.72]No!
[20:04.60]No!
[20:05.46]No!
[20:07.18]He's gonna kill me.
[20:09.17]Oh, this is bad.. Please!
[20:14.43]Yes!
[20:15.17]Alright, we should be safe here.
[20:25.85]We're going all in.
[20:28.75]All in.
[20:29.01]Time to win.
[20:30.36]That's it.
[20:32.90]Glue Man has fainted.
[20:34.86]Jerma is victorious.
[20:35.98]You looted a hundred vault coins.
[20:42.56]That's a hundred bucks right there.
[20:46.57]What a battle.
[20:46.99]Alright, that was awesome.
[20:54.99]Now what?
[20:55.31]Okay, should I... One credit or three credits?
[20:59.75]I feel like we could make some money here.
[21:01.69]Three credits, let's go.
[21:07.49]Three rats.
[21:11.45]What is it to hold the rats?
[21:13.59]Twenty.
[21:13.99]Ugh.
[21:14.31]Ugh.
[21:26.59]Oh, hold on.
[21:33.58]God damn it.
[21:39.42]Gloom Man, Gloom Man.
[21:40.28]Uh-oh, I'm gonna lose it all.
[21:41.56]Rat, rat, rat!
[21:44.64]That's a big hit. 15.
[21:56.60]Fuck, I spent more money trying to hold the rats.
[22:04.95]No, don't hold them.
[22:05.89]It's more money.
[22:06.59]It's not worth it.
[22:07.45]It's minus five bucks.
[22:09.15]There we go!
[22:09.75]That's a hit.
[22:20.54]I gotta go down.
[22:21.14]I gotta drop my bet.
[22:22.86]I'll drop to two.
[22:31.19]Shit.
[22:34.93]Alright, that's okay.
[22:35.89]That's ten bucks.
[22:38.59]Coward.
[22:41.99]I don't wanna- I just got a big- I just made a hundred bald coins.
[22:46.51]Alright, is there a pay table?
[22:53.89]Ooh, look at that.
[22:55.65]There it is.
[22:55.95]Okay, here we go.
[22:56.53]Look.
[22:58.89]Bald coins are worth the most.
[23:00.89]A full Jupiter is worth the second most.
[23:05.81]Yeah.
[23:06.49]Alright, so the rat symbol is the reason why you're seeing the most of it is because the rat's the... is the least special blend.
[23:14.41]So we're looking for Jupiters and bald coins.
[23:18.96]Use the glue.
[23:24.08]Oh, look at this.
[23:24.68]Props.
[23:25.26]That's cool.
[23:27.48]So the rats were there.
[23:28.42]That's the glue.
[23:29.74]That's cool.
[23:30.08]There are the bald coins.
[23:32.94]You're a millionaire.
[23:41.29]Use the cheat screen?
[23:42.23]I'm not cheating yet.
[23:49.16]Bald coin.
[23:49.62]Bald coin.
[23:54.11]Shit.
[23:58.47]Ah, what is Blue Man worth?
[23:59.55]That'd be 60.
[24:02.58]It's worth it.
[24:03.00]Give it to me.
[24:05.72]God damn it.
[24:14.28]Damn it.
[24:18.01]No, I'm gonna have to put more money in.
[24:23.89]Take it down to zero.
[24:24.73]Hey, coming back.
[24:25.53]We're not broke yet.
[24:26.15]I can't do it.
[24:26.73]I can do it with two, but it's not worth it.
[24:29.65]Shit.
[24:58.79]Try a different machine.
[24:59.63]This one's rat infested.
[25:01.25]Life is pain!
[25:02.97]I hate- It's $75 now.
[25:03.99]Well, technically $50 down, but who's counting?
[25:29.75]Here we go, alright.
[25:31.31]Let's bring it back.
[25:32.18]Another one.

[25:57.21]I need one more balled coin, and that's 2500 bucks, and that's just, that's a win.
[26:01.15]That's a completion of the game.
[26:06.37]God damn it.

[26:55.79]It's right there.
[26:56.79]Yes!
[27:03.91]Alright, we got it.
[27:12.86]We've unlocked the minigame Biair Crossing.
[27:17.98]However this works, I'm not sure.
[27:20.67]Burgers collected.
[27:22.63]Injured Biaz.
[27:25.83]Level one.
[27:26.31]What?

[27:45.94]Five burgers.
[27:46.58]Alright, what do I need?

[28:08.54]Oh, Jesus.
[28:10.20]There's one.
[28:15.25]Two.
[28:17.87]Oh my god.
[28:18.59]Okay, that hurt.
[28:20.14]So that's one injured biad.
[28:21.96]Does that take away from my money?
[28:26.78]Oh, you can see the corpses stay.
[28:30.78]That's so funny.
[28:32.16]Alright.
[28:33.63]Did I miss a burger?
[28:36.19]There's a burger down here.
[28:41.99]Wait, I thought you said there was a burger down here.
[28:44.73]Oh shit, there is.
[28:46.25]Okay, that's five.
[28:46.84]I got it.
[28:49.99]Only two.
[28:52.46]Oh my god, okay.
[29:03.54]Get across.
[29:04.08]Come on, come on, come on, come on, go, go, go.
[29:07.07]Is that Otto?
[29:10.79]Oh, that's awesome.
[29:12.65]Hello, Otto!
[29:14.91]Any more?
[29:15.85]I think that's it.
[29:21.12]$7.99.
[29:21.30]I missed a burger.
[29:24.50]I don't know what that was.
[29:25.16]I missed one.
[29:28.80]Level 3.
[29:29.86]This is so cool.
[29:35.48]Just stay on the yellow line.
[29:37.36]White line.
[29:37.82]Whatever.
[29:43.03]Why are the hamburgers on the road?
[29:57.49]I'm su- there's probably eight.
[30:00.31]Seven... Ugh.
[30:07.77]Free the Viez?
[30:08.87]Are they trapped?
[30:11.01]They're not trapped, are they?
[30:13.24]I don't think they are.
[30:15.66]I think they're supposed to be there.
[30:22.54]Okay, alright, I need to slow down.
[30:25.06]They're not trapped.
[30:28.52]I can't save them!
[30:31.56]Free them!
[30:32.26]There's no- I don't free them!
[30:34.10]They're just stuck in here.
[30:35.04]Alright, hold on.
[30:44.05]Is it one more?
[30:46.11]Here it is.
[30:46.65]Eight.
[30:48.19]Wait.
[30:50.13]Who do you wish that one?
[30:51.67]Try another!
[30:54.95]That's so cool.
[30:58.84]Look at all these references.
[30:59.94]75% off, I think that's it.
[31:06.17]Five injured beers, eight out of eight burgers eaten.
[31:08.09]Good.
[31:08.71]Next level.
[31:09.85]How many levels are there?
[31:10.87]Does this progressively just get harder?
[31:12.47]There's one.
[31:27.32]Wait.
[31:27.88]No.
[31:28.12]Alright, so this is where I... Oh my god.
[31:47.47]I'm panicking.
[31:48.93]Stop.
[31:49.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[31:50.15]Okay, okay, okay.
[31:52.00]I need way more than this.
[31:53.18]Five...

[32:08.25]Quickly, get across the road!
[32:12.79]Oh, fuck.
[32:17.92]This is so awesome because there are just so many here waiting.
[32:22.96]The lore.
[32:28.97]It's a live system in this game.
[32:30.39]It makes complete sense.
[32:34.71]Oh my goodness.
[32:37.78]This is kinda hard.
[32:38.66]Alright, I'm gonna slow down.
[32:56.89]I suck.
[32:57.67]I can't do it.
[32:58.81]Hold on.
[33:00.73]He's running into the cards.
[33:02.53]I promise I'm not.
[33:04.07]Alright, safe.
[33:12.58]There's only one more to get.
[33:19.67]Oh, fuck.
[33:33.87]Your stomach can get hit, by the way.
[33:35.26]Yeah, your stomach is a hitbox.
[33:36.46]It can get hit.
[33:38.08]Makes perfect sense.
[33:39.96]Alright.
[33:40.54]I'm gonna run this way.
[33:43.90]And... Oh, fuck!
[33:49.91]Is there any more?
[33:50.41]Uhhh...
[34:02.66]Smile paste.
[34:04.10]Hold on, is there any more burgers over here?
[34:07.32]There's Otto.
[34:08.18]Get out of the trash!
[34:08.84]Don't go in the trash.
[34:11.70]Bad dog.
[34:18.25]No more?
[34:18.63]I got twelve.
[34:25.03]Twelve out of twelve.
[34:27.63]What the hell is this?
[34:29.98]This is a boss fight?
[34:32.90]What?
[34:34.24]Are you serious?
[34:37.86]Oh, okay.
[34:38.38]I get it, I get it.
[34:38.98]Do I have to get burgers?
[34:41.00]I'm dead.
[34:45.42]You keep going or game sucks.
[34:47.66]Okay, obviously gonna keep going.
[34:48.94]Is he shooting burgers?
[34:55.45]Alright, I gotta watch out for the bullet hill.
[35:00.85]Oh my god, I gotta go across the whole thing.
[35:08.76]How do I attack?
[35:10.20]Is there anything I can do?
[35:11.00]I gotta stay in the middle.
[35:11.78]What does that mean?
[35:16.29]Oh, thank- shrapnel comes out!
[35:18.31]Oh my goodness, this is cool.
[35:19.35]This is elaborate.
[35:24.91]Go!
[35:38.88]Alright, watch out.
[35:39.38]I gotta find the right spot to stand.
[35:42.64]Spread him out!
[35:50.14]Is that a tire?
[35:51.92]E!
[35:54.78]Oh shit, I get it.
[35:55.70]Okay, this is... I have to throw tires at him.
[35:58.48]Probably three times, like Dr. Robotnik style.
[36:11.06]Getting faster.
[36:11.74]Oh god, alright.
[36:14.24]Now this is phase two.
[36:17.32]Just keep running in circles.
[36:24.05]Oh, he has a- yeah, Mecha Burgah Boy has a health bar.
[36:26.61]I can hit him- six times?!
[36:29.73]Ugh!
[36:31.47]Come on, hurry hurry, go go go go go go go go go go go!
[36:33.47]Quick quick quick quick quick!
[36:35.41]I almost just missed.
[36:38.46]This is gonna be impossible.
[36:40.91]I'll have to do that four more times.
[36:50.34]Holy shit.
[36:53.60]Please!
[36:54.48]Please!
[36:55.06]Oh no!
[36:57.82]Oh god.
[37:03.59]Shit.
[37:07.99]Imagine this on like x5 speed at the end.
[37:24.82]I was just gonna hit by that.
[37:25.69]I completely forgot that it happened.
[37:28.73]Alright, there's one.
[37:32.97]Alright, let's go.
[37:46.90]This is gonna be the rest of the stream.
[37:48.16]I'm gonna beat this.
[38:11.06]Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster!
[38:15.68]I'm only 500 pounds, feed me more!
[38:26.69]Watch the fire.
[38:33.83]He changes it up, he's starting to juke around.
[38:42.79]Oh, dear.
[38:47.44]Oh, dear.
[38:50.78]Come on!
[38:54.96]No!
[38:55.40]Wait, I'm too slow!
[38:57.08]Oh!
[38:57.84]Oh, goddammit!
[38:59.64]I threw it the wrong... I didn't know that was possible.
[39:12.03]Yes, somebody got it.
[39:13.11]Yes, that was the big Bertha arcade game.
[39:15.43]Alright, I'm going to get it this time.
[39:27.18]You got to be quick because he moves fast.
[39:33.02]Here's the tire.
[39:33.94]Get it.
[39:42.45]I think we stay at this speed.
[39:43.63]I don't think we go any faster than this.
[39:47.79]Or maybe it's only this for two phases.
[39:51.11]Oh, shit.
[39:56.59]That's faster.
[40:03.96]Oh, Jesus.
[40:16.12]Alright, here it is.
[40:17.32]Gimme!
[40:21.29]Oh, it's going faster!

[41:19.33]Oh, God.
[41:21.64]One more, that's it.
[41:23.06]I only did one credit bet for this, by the way.
[41:41.97]Is that... Don't get hit, don't get hit, don't get hit, don't get hit.
[42:00.13]No, don't leave!

[43:56.88]I'll get it here.
[44:09.51]Just gotta be patient.
[44:10.21]Alright, Bullet Health.
[44:10.89]Three more!
[44:20.64]This is it!
[44:39.39]This is the last speed!
[44:44.07]Alright, come on.
[45:21.54]Oh, don't fuck it up already!
[45:22.88]Alright, come on, he's gonna move.

[46:20.34]It's been commenced.
[46:26.29]The vault of burgers is ours.
[46:33.32]26 injured beers, 31 out of 32.
[46:34.88]That was fucking awesome.
[46:42.84]Ten bucks!
[46:44.54]Ten dollars!
[46:50.36]Because I was only doing one credit.
[46:54.01]That would have been 30 bucks.
[46:56.86]Hey, it was the ride.
[46:57.70]The ride was worth it.
[47:00.60]Alright, so let's see.

[50:31.36]Or you can even juice some oranges with your son.
[50:33.86]Fruit.
[51:17.18]Cool and crisp with a refreshing crunch.
[51:19.44]It's no wonder it's the doctor's favorite.
[51:21.60]At just 95 calories, it's the guilt-free party fruit.

[56:04.26]Let me just make sure I'm getting this right.
[56:06.42]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[56:06.76]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[56:07.00]So this is the first one.
[56:11.00]This is 3.
[56:11.66]1, 2, 3.
[56:11.72]3, 1, 2, 3.
[56:11.80]1, 2, 3.
[56:31.29]three what emote is this going to be that's the question okay that's that so it's 20 by 20 so that's three nine one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
[56:56.52]So it can be four on either side, right?
[56:58.44]So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[57:01.56]Okay.
[57:03.44]This is definitely the same thing in the middle here.
[57:07.16]Because they're both nine.
[57:10.56]One, four.
[57:13.02]Let me count here.
[57:21.07]Three, six.
[57:23.59]Let me see.
[57:25.50]What's down here?
[57:26.10]This is 8.
[57:26.28]7.
[57:26.30]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[57:26.44]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[57:26.56]1, 2, 3, 4.
[57:26.64]2, 3.
[57:26.68]Yeah, this is correct.
[57:28.53]So this is 3 space.
[57:29.37]This is 3 space.
[57:29.93]There's 5 in the middle here.
[57:31.97]5, 5, 6.
[57:32.03]So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[57:55.86]And then this is a 2.
[57:56.70]This is 3.
[58:01.26]2.
[58:01.44]Alright.
[58:03.62]That's part of the 6.
[58:04.52]That's the 1.
[58:04.86]So that's 5.
[58:06.96]1.
[58:06.98]3.
[58:07.70]4.
[58:07.72]1, 2, 3.
[58:07.78]1.
[58:09.96]So it's going to be right here.
[58:14.76]That's the 1.
[58:20.32]Excellent commentary.
[58:22.30]I'm trying to concentrate.
[58:25.98]I can't screw this up.
[58:29.92]I'm trying so hard to like, pay attention.
[58:32.16]1, 2, 3, 4.
[58:34.28]1, 2, 2, 4.
[58:34.44]1, 3, 2, 4.
[58:34.58]1, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[58:34.78]I think I can get this though.
[58:36.06]Let's see.
[58:36.46]Nope.
[58:36.62]Look at me!
[58:57.42]Is there a big number here?
[58:58.24]Let's see, 5, 1, 3.
[59:00.32]It could be somewhere over here.
[59:02.38]This is part of the 3.
[59:05.12]What about this way?
[59:06.94]There's a 9 in here.
[59:13.54]Shit, a 20 by 20.
[59:16.49]Of course you were gonna do that to me.
[59:17.85]4, let's see.
[59:20.43]7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.
[59:27.38]Let's see here.
[59:30.56]2, 9, 3.
[59:30.62]Hold on.
[59:31.17]Can I do this whole thing?
[59:31.83]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[59:34.85]Yes, I can.
[59:36.21]This column's done.
[59:39.79]So that's 4.
[59:41.19]Then 3 has to be in here.
[59:42.23]1, 2, 3, space 1.
[59:46.48]1 has to be like right here.
[59:48.68]That's the 1.
[59:50.62]And then here's your 3 in here somewhere.
[59:58.63]One.
[59:59.53]One, two, three, four.
[60:01.33]Has to be in here somewhere.
[60:03.35]Okay, we're getting- we're making progress.
[60:09.38]Now that leaves me here.
[60:11.38]This is- this is one of the twos.
[60:19.64]One, two, three, four, five.
[60:21.54]Has to be here.
[60:23.26]There's the two.
[60:25.10]There's another two.
[60:26.46]So now I need a four.
[60:37.20]Four, seven.
[60:40.49]Six, six.
[60:41.17]Yeah, that's done.
[60:42.47]Four, four.
[60:45.37]This is a one in here somewhere.
[60:53.04]How far away is this now?
[60:53.94]This is nine, so... Four.
[61:01.88]This is three.
[61:03.30]Okay.
[61:04.40]Don't have it yet.
[61:08.96]But this has to be a two.
[61:12.48]It's probably right there.
[61:22.10]Two, two.
[61:22.94]This is one of those games you play in a retirement home.
[61:28.54]Kind of, yeah.
[61:32.38]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[61:38.80]O is wrong.
[61:39.62]How is O wrong?
[61:43.98]The 3 has to be in here somewhere.
[61:46.90]Row 18, column M. What's wrong with it?
[61:53.16]Is U 1?
[62:00.32]F is wrong.
[62:00.97]No, you guys are getting in my head.
[62:02.25]Alright, no, you're getting in my head.
[62:18.39]You can fill some of... Oh, yeah, I can.
[62:20.89]Two... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[62:29.12]Can't be any of these.
[62:30.00]So let's see.
[62:35.18]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[62:37.96]It has to be all of these.
[62:48.30]one one one one this is part of four five one three four I could do that why did I remove those crosses I don't know you're right what's what am I doing
[63:19.27]Okay, here we go.
[63:21.65]That helps this out.
[63:22.31]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[63:22.59]So that makes sense.
[63:23.60]Let me see.
[63:24.16]That's 1, 3.
[63:24.36]Yeah, okay, because this can't... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[63:45.20]Got it.
[63:45.48]There's a three.
[63:46.98]Alright.
[63:47.56]There's the three.
[63:48.40]This row's done.
[63:50.05]Three.
[63:50.85]Three.
[63:51.97]One.
[63:52.69]Three.
[64:03.97]That leaves us with... Let me just see here.
[64:09.10]Three.
[64:10.34]This has to be three.
[64:11.22]Right in the middle here, right?
[64:13.58]Okay.
[64:15.90]And then there's 1.
[64:16.44]And then there's a 3 here.
[64:19.56]It has to be right here.
[64:20.61]That's 2.
[64:20.87]So that's 3, 3, 1, 3, 4.
[64:24.67]This is 2, 2, 2.
[64:25.11]This is one of the 4s.
[64:48.13]It would be here.
[64:49.17]It kind of has to be here.
[64:50.78]It might not.
[64:54.16]I messed up row 18.
[64:56.26]How?
[64:58.76]No, it's fine.
[64:59.58]It's not messed up.
[65:05.80]I can do this again here, though.
[65:06.86]It's because it's the same amount.
[65:10.53]There's one.
[65:11.13]Okay, three.
[65:13.53]Because this is a nine.
[65:16.06]What about here?
[65:18.87]Row 18 is done.
[65:24.25]I knew that.
[65:28.95]Bingo!
[65:31.03]Now here's a- okay, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[65:33.30]So this has to be here.
[65:36.42]This is- okay, I got it.
[65:37.02]Wait, wait, calm down, calm down, calm down.
[65:38.94]Two?
[65:39.46]Right here.
[65:41.22]This can't be down here because this row is now done.
[65:43.64]Therefore, this is the 2.
[65:45.44]This is the 3.
[65:47.34]This row is done.
[65:53.32]We're getting there.
[65:54.00]Close.
[65:57.74]4, 3, 1, 5.
[65:58.26]3, 3.
[65:58.76]We're good.
[66:02.53]We're fine.
[66:04.57]That means... What does that mean?
[66:07.35]3, 1, 3.
[66:07.99]I'm not going to be able to get that.
[66:12.70]Somebody just gave 50 bucks.
[66:15.38]Who just gave money?
[66:20.02]Magical Marissa gave $60.
[66:22.19]And says, you should probably hire someone else to do this puzzle.
[66:28.19]No, I can do this.
[66:29.97]Thank you for the 50 bucks and then 10 bucks right before it.
[66:33.59]$60 from Magical Marissa.
[66:40.84]Thank you.
[66:44.64]That's a ton of money.
[66:45.70]Really appreciate it.
[66:49.77]I can't rush through.
[66:50.63]I can't rush through this.
[66:52.17]Seriously, because if I fuck up one thing, I have to go all the way back and it's going to ruin everything.
[66:59.88]But 60 bucks.
[67:01.08]Thank you so much.
[67:05.22]That's an absolute shitload of money.
[67:12.10]Two, one, four.
[67:14.44]Hold on, wait.
[67:16.60]I'm just checking.
[67:17.28]Four, one, two.
[67:20.40]He's so good at what he does.
[67:23.47]Two, two, one, four.
[67:26.11]That's the whole rolls done.
[67:34.62]I'm gonna break the Mr. Mosquito disk in fucking half.
[67:42.52]One, five.
[67:43.24]Okay, here we go.
[67:43.92]One, three.
[67:46.54]Can't be here, because that's one, two, right?
[67:51.84]Easy.
[67:52.28]Slow down.
[67:53.46]That's the one.
[67:54.14]This is done.
[67:58.14]Done.
[68:03.65]One, nine.
[68:05.51]Here we go.
[68:08.70]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... 2!
[68:09.14]That's done.
[68:09.68]1, 2, 9, 1.
[68:09.76]Okay.
[68:09.98]And then... That's done.
[68:10.80]There's your 2.
[68:11.60]Alright, hold on.
[68:13.86]Slow down.
[68:14.34]1, 2...
[68:38.43]How many twos are here?
[68:40.63]There's one, two, three, four.
[68:41.87]There's four twos.
[68:43.29]And then this.
[68:44.11]So there's four twos in here.
[68:45.03]So you've got one, two.
[68:47.92]Can't be there.
[68:48.48]It's gotta be like that.
[68:50.06]Two, two, two.
[68:52.06]Alright, that's all I know.
[69:01.95]Okay.
[69:06.29]Seven.
[69:06.63]Can I put any more in here?
[69:08.71]I don't think so.
[69:10.35]What have we got?
[69:11.15]This is four... One, four... So this is... Okay, all... The twos are done.
[69:16.48]So these are both fours.
[69:17.84]So this has to be like this.
[69:19.56]What the fuck is that?
[69:20.84]Why is this playing?
[69:30.05]Why is this playing?
[69:31.91]Is this supposed to be distraction?
[69:34.05]Did I do that right?
[69:36.21]1, 4, 4.
[69:38.23]That's it.

[76:23.79]What else?
[76:31.98]What did we get for that?
[76:35.04]We got anything new for that?
[76:37.06]That was the Jupiter, right?
[76:38.18]Oh, there it is.
[76:42.95]I forgot that this was slots.
[76:44.99]Yeah, me too.
[76:50.47]We just need bald coin and that's it.
[76:52.90]We've come to the end.
[76:53.74]That's the only thing we haven't seen.
[77:02.21]Come on, give me a ball coin.
[77:04.10]Give me a ball coin.

[77:36.63]We need to see it.
[77:37.31]I'm gonna lose it all.
[78:00.66]What's up?
[78:00.98]I just need to hit one.
[78:01.72]Look.

[79:26.78]Again!
[79:29.08]We got a couple chances here.
[79:42.03]Ah, look at the left reel.
[79:45.81]No.
[79:51.39]No.
[79:51.75]Ugh, that was worth a shot.
[80:04.42]Oh, no.
[80:05.50]Can I, I can't put money in?
[80:08.24]No, I can't put money in until, like, I have to go to zero.
[80:15.17]Life is pain!
[80:16.75]I hate- Shit.
[80:23.57]I need to hit it.
[80:24.98]I need to hit it organically.
[80:31.12]No cheating.
[80:32.04]I have to hit this organically with money.
[80:41.95]I'll take a Jerm of fear too.
[80:46.96]Alright.
[80:47.80]I'll take it.
[80:48.18]I'll take it.
[80:48.97]Dammit.

[81:28.05]Let's do it.
[81:30.27]Give me another one.
[81:31.51]Alright.

[83:57.20]Come on.
[83:57.50]This is the strategy.
[84:12.54]Wait, I'm just spending the same amount of money every time!
[84:21.44]This doesn't do anything!
[84:24.54]That's not helpful!
[84:31.31]No!
[84:36.11]Maybe another hundred dollar bill.
[84:48.18]I just need to get the big hit.
[84:54.16]Do it!
[84:57.54]No!
[84:57.88]Don't hold the rat!

[85:25.13]I'm not gonna cheat.
[85:25.81]I'm not cheating.
[85:27.41]I'm not gonna have it.
[85:37.67]What about groceries?
[85:38.59]What?

[86:57.12]It's not even worth it.
[87:01.44]Oh my goodness.
[87:27.40]If I cheat, I wish I could put in like 500.

[98:36.98]I can hold after putting in money.
[98:38.77]I didn't know that.
[98:52.35]If you don't get out of the hole, I'm going to unsub.
[98:54.95]You understand that?
[98:56.45]That's almost impossible to do that right now.
[99:00.73]There's no cash out machine.
[99:02.69]I can't turn this into money.

[100:30.65]God damn it.
[100:34.37]No one knows how to play this game.
[100:36.03]Yeah, that's right.
[100:36.49]I'm the only one that has the controls here.
[100:42.33]I just hit something.
[100:52.86]Alright.

[103:36.90]Service button.
[103:37.96]You can't press the service button.

[103:43.25]Wait.
[103:43.41]Dev in the chat.
[103:53.80]Alright, we got Dev in the chat.

[104:05.05]There's a credits page.
[104:05.89]Yeah, and there's something I can press.
[104:16.97]Did I hit a Jupiter?
[104:17.73]I did.
[104:18.57]He did say something.
[104:19.42]Where was it?
[104:21.18]Cad.

[104:22.84]Restart the game.
[104:24.04]Okay.

[104:35.15]It's only from the main title.
[104:36.33]Yeah.
[104:36.59]Okay.
[104:36.75]Is there anything else to see?
[104:39.31]Besides the, uh... In here?
[104:43.97]David Bowie seriously suck a fart out of my ass.
[104:49.90]Why so mean to David Bowie?
[104:52.12]I don't understand.
[105:06.48]Failed the Jupiter puzzle.
[105:07.70]Okay.
[105:07.92]Alright, here we go.
[105:11.70]Credits.
[105:14.76]So, there's something I can do in the credits.
[105:16.70]And actually, you know what?
[105:17.74]This is a good idea.
[105:19.94]Absolutely fantastic.
[105:20.94]This was hilarious.
[105:23.25]This was so much more than I ever could have imagined.
[105:26.91]For a community fan project.
[105:30.77]Discord.
[105:31.31]You've been in Discord talking about this for a long time.
[105:35.31]So, absolutely.
[105:37.83]Claps.
[105:39.05]By the way, anybody can play this.
[105:42.41]If not after tonight's stream, then...
[105:47.16]on Monday.
[105:48.32]Just gonna be free.
[105:50.30]Cat has decided just to... Anybody.
[105:52.56]It's gonna be on Steam.
[105:53.38]It's just on Steam.
[105:55.38]For you just to have fun with and play with.
[105:57.02]So, that's amazing.
[106:02.51]These people!
[106:06.01]Go give them a follow.
[106:08.17]Right now.
[106:11.21]Okay, so... I was told that there's...
[106:17.25]You have to help me.
[106:19.25]Trevor has kept me in his basement for months working on this fucking game.
[106:26.92]He's coming back up to a fucking chair.
[106:29.94]I don't know what month it is.
[106:32.16]I don't know what day it is.
[106:33.24]All I know is that if I don't work on the game, I get hit.
[106:37.46]And I have to eat Otto's fucking dog biscuit.
[106:52.06]What the fuck is this?
[106:57.63]Oh my god!
[107:21.07]This is terrifying.
[107:29.11]But KTD and Kat, absolutely fantastic job.
[107:32.73]This is fucking amazing.
[107:39.82]Oh, I get a special thing?
[107:40.92]Shit!
[107:45.10]Let him go.
[107:45.62]I don't...
[107:49.37]Click the bird?
[107:49.93]I think this is the only one.
[107:53.73]What about me?
[107:54.13]Can I click me?
[107:56.45]Oh, I just clicked on that and it... did it just... I think... Yeah, it opened up my stream.
[108:09.92]My stream won't even load.
[108:11.00]That's funny.
[108:14.18]Alright, so I think we've seen everything there is to see in Jerma slots.
[108:25.65]Oh, fail Jupiter.
[108:26.55]Right, okay.
[108:27.09]Let's fail the Jupiter.
[108:27.91]Yeah, we have to do this again.
[108:33.44]Great.
[108:39.64]That's a nut button down there.
[108:41.23]I didn't even see that.
[108:45.13]What the hell was that?
[108:47.65]Alright, so let's, uh, let's cheat it.
[108:50.75]Let's fail Jupiter.
[108:57.22]Alright, so, fail this.
[109:10.67]How do- how do I fill it?
[109:11.89]You fucking idiot!
[109:39.61]Now lose to Glooban.
[109:40.89]Okay, let's see what that does.
[109:42.57]Alright, let's lose.
[109:48.41]What about run?
[109:50.49]I'm not gonna turn this down, it's a little up.
[109:53.63]There we go.
[109:54.53]Should I run?
[110:09.81]Yeah, let's run.
[110:11.39]You ran away.
[110:12.40]What a coward.
[110:14.16]Oh, that's it.
[110:20.74]So, okay.
[110:21.50]What does this mean, though?
[110:22.30]What is the Jerm... This is J-E-R-M-A.
[110:24.94]You have no Jermas left.
[110:27.80]What does that mean?
[110:35.57]Oh, switching Pokémon.
[110:36.83]Okay.
[110:36.99]Okay.
[110:49.40]He's not playing as good as he was last time.
[110:50.84]Nice.
[111:01.90]Good hit.
[111:03.90]I'm gonna win by accident.
[111:05.06]I guess I could just do Jex over and over again.
[111:07.48]Yeah, so he's gonna heal.
[111:20.49]He's disappointed you cheated.
[111:21.77]Sip the iced coffee?
[111:26.17]Yeah, I gotta drink the iced coffee like five times.
[111:30.73]No, but... Hold on.
[111:37.46]What happens if you run out of all your moves?
[111:40.66]I think you just can't use them.
[111:48.31]Okay, so let's see.
[111:49.86]Did we not... Okay, ice coffee.
[111:51.36]Restores one of your abilities.
[111:53.98]We didn't... Okay, I want to see what this does.
[111:57.12]Jerma injects himself with pure cholesterol.
[111:59.38]I just want to see if there's an animation for it.
[112:02.12]Because that would be the only thing we didn't click on.
[112:15.11]I know, I just wanted to see what it did.
[112:20.96]Chokeslam.
[112:21.44]There it is.
[112:32.13]I know it was a full heal.
[112:33.17]Oh, whoops.
[112:35.55]That's the wrong thing.
[112:36.91]Good thing he shook it off.
[112:41.55]Restart the game once more and check out the stuff on the floor and in the trash can.
[112:46.35]Okay.
[112:57.01]This was so much fun, though.
[113:00.05]Before you get in the chair.
[113:01.09]Okay, I see.
[113:13.06]Trash is going to be full of memes.
[113:14.62]It better be.
[113:18.28]But, uh, while I have a second here... I must say...
[113:25.11]This is, uh, this is fucking incredible.
[113:30.21]I cannot believe that these references and these jokes and these things in this community, I can't believe it.
[113:37.05]This is fucking amazing.
[113:41.33]All this exists because we all collectively think the same fucking thing is funny.
[113:46.77]Or interesting.
[113:52.51]Uh, it's... It's absolutely fucking incredible to me.
[114:05.63]I don't think you're funny.
[114:09.32]It's alright.
[114:10.52]Even if you don't.
[114:20.10]Alright, kill me, glue man.
[114:21.04]Let's go.
[114:21.44]Kill me.
[114:29.53]I don't think I've hit that any one time.
[114:34.61]How am I breaking free?
[114:36.85]Alright, Blue Man Drinks, Wrestle Sweat.
[114:52.44]There it is, Chokeslam.
[114:53.46]Critical hit.
[114:54.30]What happens?
[114:56.46]It's super effective.
[114:57.32]Jerma has fainted.
[114:58.74]Blue Man is victorious.
[115:00.18]You lost 100 Bald Coins!
[115:02.35]He takes money from you if you lose.
[115:05.67]Wow.
[115:08.25]That's funny.
[115:08.75]Alright, let's go see what's in the trash.
[115:23.64]So what, alright, Kat, I got a question.
[115:25.32]What achievements am I missing?
[115:26.68]There's two more achievements that I don't have.
[115:29.86]What are they?
[115:34.82]You know, is there a secret?
[115:42.23]No, the perfect BA game, okay.
[115:44.73]Hold on, I gotta turn this back on.
[115:45.55]Oops.
[115:49.43]Don't tell him.
[115:52.37]I'll try to press the service button.
[116:02.40]Alright, so.
[116:04.08]Start.
[116:06.16]Look on the floor.
[116:06.90]Yeah, alright.
[116:15.37]That's fucking amazing.
[116:29.05]Where are those actually?
[116:30.93]Where are they?
[116:32.37]About the author of Snake in the Clouds.
[116:34.43]What else is in there?
[116:35.15]I can't see.
[116:35.49]There's something underneath it.
[116:39.15]Is it a snake?
[116:43.47]It's my children's book.
[116:52.61]Oh, there it is.
[116:55.81]It's my book.
[116:57.92]Okay, so the other achievements are... Yeah, I can't hit the service button.
[117:02.40]So the other achievements are to perfect the Biag game and then to get 10,000 coins organically.
[117:13.29]That was awesome.
[117:15.27]I missed a giant Jupiter.
[117:16.75]Where?
[117:25.77]Organically.
[117:27.77]We don't have time for organically.
[117:30.55]I don't think you need to do it organically.
[117:34.06]Uh, not a perfect bi run, just all the burgers.
[117:36.64]Oh, okay, I see.
[117:46.99]Uh... CAD, uh, CAD VIP.
[117:53.21]This is great.
[117:55.93]This is like a solid hour and a half, two hours worth of game content.
[118:04.60]And you and I are going to have a little discussion after the stream here.
[118:09.74]Because this is next level.
[118:16.95]Uh oh, he's in trouble!
[118:23.39]Was it the short joke?
[118:25.37]You and I are gonna have a little bit of convo about some of these things.
[118:33.68]And I, uh, well, there's a bunch of people here to talk about it.
[118:37.38]I was supposed to today, if you didn't, you missed what happened earlier.
[118:40.27]I was gonna do a scratch ticket for charity thing and this.
[118:47.47]But, um, there's no state lottery in Nevada.
[118:51.39]It doesn't exist.
[118:52.03]Scratch tickets do not exist in Nevada.
[118:54.33]And it was a major, massive oversight on my part for not assuming that there was...
[119:00.52]No state lottery in Nevada.
[119:03.36]I had no idea.
[119:04.78]I'm from Massachusetts originally.
[119:07.88]I was under the impression I could walk into a gas station and just buy... But... So, I know that is pretty ironic, it is.
[119:16.54]So what's gonna happen here is there's a couple of scratch ticket things that I can do, possibly.
[119:21.74]But for the immediate future, I'm just going to give $221 to the Nevada Humane Society.
[119:30.91]So retroactively, we're just gonna say that each death in Sekiro was a dollar.
[119:35.83]So that's just gonna happen.
[119:37.75]And if I can somehow figure out a way to do that...
[119:42.61]with actually getting tickets.
[119:44.52]I was a little disappointed today, but Mr. Mosquito was a lot of fun until I broke the disk, and then this was incredible, so I'm very happy.
[119:56.22]$221, not $2.21.
[119:57.52]Yeah, there's also, like, I could do have somebody send them to me, and then, like, I just cash them out in that state later.
[120:06.23]There's a couple of ways.
[120:11.56]But just for the immediate future to wrap up like the Sekiro thing.
[120:14.33]Because that was to wrap up Sekiro.
[120:16.87]So I'm just going to donate the money.
[120:20.65]So, for the purposes of the rest of tonight, I'm going to take a break.
[120:25.83]And we'll come back and I'll just chill.
[120:27.41]We'll probably just hang out.
[120:30.51]Might put in... Might put in... There's a couple of options here.
[120:37.67]I don't know if I want to do...
[120:40.46]I'm not sure if I want to do Monster Rancher 4.
[120:42.64]Because I'm probably only going to stream for like another hour.
[120:44.36]So I think we're just going to come back and just chill.
[120:47.54]And like I'll turn the camera on and let's talk and hang out.
[120:52.97]That means I gotta go put clothes on.
[121:03.91]More Mr. Mosquito.
[121:08.24]No.
[121:09.16]That game made me angry.
[121:12.10]But we'll figure it out.
[121:12.94]Maybe we'll do something else.
[121:15.36]I'll be back and we'll hang out for a little bit while longer before I turn off the stream.
[121:19.82]See you guys in like two minutes.
[121:21.64]Three minutes.
[121:23.94]I'll just keep the music playing.
[121:24.92]Why not?
[121:27.56]If you take it off, I'll see you in a couple days.
[121:33.17]I'm gonna take two days off.
[121:34.81]So I'll be back on... What's today?
[121:38.70]I'll see you on... Saturday, Sunday, I'll see you on Tuesday.
[121:43.84]But for those of you sticking around... By the way, next week is VR.
[121:49.53]So I'm going to get back into VR.
[121:51.29]Probably start with Mindshow, maybe, or end with Mindshow.
[121:54.61]GeoGuessr?
[121:55.19]I could do GeoGuessr.
[121:56.05]We could just hang out and play it.
[121:59.97]But those of you that are sticking around, I'll see you very soon.
[122:03.67]Be right back.
