[00:01.83]hello is he live it's not showing up for me what up I'm here refresh hey ready just see good afternoon guys how you doing
[00:25.11]We have actually quite a few things to talk about before we go forward with this Tuesdays DOS.
[00:33.99]That's right, we're playing DOS today.
[00:37.37]But, stuff to discuss.
[00:41.06]Most important thing number one is... A lot of people are going to be not happy about this, but I have to say it.
[00:49.57]You know, I'll wait.
[00:50.07]I'm gonna wait.
[00:50.51]I'll wait to disappoint a shitload of people when we're live for at least two or three minutes.
[00:58.04]I'm about to disappoint everybody.
[01:00.70]Well, maybe not.
[01:01.64]No, maybe not.
[01:03.96]You gotta tell us now.
[01:04.74]Just hold on.
[01:05.22]Hold on, I'll tell you in a second.
[01:14.40]No, I'm not moving platforms.
[01:19.16]Why would I open up a stream like that?
[01:22.28]Oh, hey guys, Gerber here.
[01:23.92]I just want to say I'm going to disappoint the fuck out of everybody here.
[01:28.70]Wouldn't I at least have to be like, hey guys, move into X. Move into Y. Come on over.
[01:35.72]Why would I start with, hey, you guys are going to be really disappointed in me.
[01:48.33]So, um... Alright, but it's been enough time.
[01:51.63]We've got, like, 6,000 people.
[01:54.28]Yeah, it's fine.
[01:55.62]So, uh... Just say it.
[01:58.16]Just get it out.
[01:58.78]I'm gonna breathe in once and I'm gonna say it.
[02:01.22]The green screen stream is delayed.
[02:02.82]There you go.
[02:03.34]Okay, it's done.
[02:06.36]Uh, sorry.
[02:10.29]Uh, there's a reason for it.
[02:13.15]over the last like week and a half or so since this diagnosis I've been doing stretches and I've been doing some exercises to help target the issue that I have in my back and chest it has shrunk my mobility down pretty low I'm very sore and I can't really move around and like do a bunch of crazy shit standing up and moving around and stuff so that's the reason why
[02:43.96]Uh, hopefully over the next few weeks, I can loosen up a little and I'll get there.
[02:54.12]So, it's still gonna happen.
[02:57.54]I just need to loosen up a bit.
[02:59.84]Because right now, these exact exercises and stretches that I'm doing, it like kind of hurts to breathe in all the way and like turn and look.
[03:10.40]So there's no way I'm going to be like, here we go.
[03:12.36]Oh, look at me.
[03:13.02]Here we go.
[03:13.34]The green screen.
[03:13.96]It's just not going to happen.
[03:16.54]But hey, here.
[03:17.50]Hey, hold on.
[03:18.08]Let me immediately make you make you happy again.
[03:20.22]Hold on here.
[03:20.76]Time to turn that around.
[03:22.64]The Minecraft stream is still on pace for the 15th.
[03:28.69]So that's good.
[03:30.27]And that's some good news.
[03:34.55]Actually, I'm going to be testing out the server either tonight or tomorrow.
[03:39.75]I'm going to do some stress testing to it.
[03:41.23]We're going to fuck around with it.
[03:42.95]It's going to be a fun experiment.
[03:45.66]Now that that's out of the way, that's a pog from me.
[03:50.12]Yeah.
[03:51.14]So that's out of the way.
[03:51.98]Let's get to it.
[03:54.44]Those of you that are new to the channel, like four months ago, four or five months ago,
[04:03.84]We used to play DOS games once a week.
[04:11.21]Lasted for three or four weeks in a row.
[04:12.89]And we're going to do it again because a shitload more games have been added to this archive list.
[04:20.09]Like thousands of them.
[04:22.03]So I just went to sort by newest additions.
[04:27.65]And we're just going to go take a look.
[04:30.85]Here's another little problem with this stream today, though.
[04:35.39]There are some pornography thumbnails.
[04:39.17]So, just gotta be careful.
[04:40.44]I'm gonna skim them first.
[04:46.50]Newest edition does not mean also censored.
[04:51.90]Actually, I already have a few queued up here.
[04:55.62]And by a few, I mean a lot.
[04:57.54]Because I also went back and picked out some of the ones that we didn't do.
[05:01.57]But ones that I maybe should have spent more time in.
[05:03.15]Some of the more popular ones.
[05:06.37]I know this is not one of them, but let's just get to it.
[05:08.99]This first one.
[05:11.23]After we talk about Turkey's five community Turkey subs.
[05:14.44]Happy Thanksgiving, Turkey.
[05:18.36]And Zoro, thank you for the five community subs.
[05:20.32]Both of you.
[05:21.34]Back to back.
[05:23.97]Let's go.
[05:25.94]This first one is, I don't know how long I'm gonna play it for.
[05:30.46]But, we'll see.
[05:31.20]Uh, the first one is called... Make a Monster.
[05:37.43]This is the Monster Maker.
[05:41.75]Make a monster, write a monster myth in your monster museum.
[05:48.56]So this one's gonna be fuckin' real exciting.
[05:50.88]Alright, make a monster.
[05:52.98]Is there no sound in this one?
[05:57.74]No background.
[05:58.34]Background 1.
[05:59.02]Background 2.
[05:59.48]We'll do background 3.
[06:02.74]Use the right mouse button or the space bar to view backgrounds.
[06:06.70]Use the left mouse button or the enter key to choose a background.
[06:11.76]I like that one.
[06:14.32]Oh, coming out of the spaceship.
[06:15.36]That's pretty good.
[06:17.44]Inside the spaceship.
[06:19.74]On the planet.
[06:20.52]Why does it all have to be from a different planet?
[06:22.48]Why can't it be from Earth?
[06:24.42]I like this one.
[06:26.58]Alright.
[06:27.30]How about bodies?
[06:28.23]Let's see.
[06:29.55]Bubbles?
[06:30.33]Ears.

[06:35.37]What is kids?
[06:40.71]Why would it be a kid?
[06:46.89]Is this just clip art?
[06:49.62]Okay, here.
[06:55.17]How do I get away?
[06:55.81]How do I get out of kids?
[06:57.89]How do I get out of this menu?
[07:02.51]How do I get out of here?
[07:04.87]Can you make it smaller?
[07:06.45]I don't think so.
[07:11.07]Oh, shit.
[07:14.65]Make it bigger?
[07:15.59]You can't.
[07:17.63]Is it escape?
[07:20.67]Tab.
[07:21.03]Oh, there we go.
[07:23.11]It's backspace?
[07:24.13]No, no, no.
[07:26.51]Alright, we're learning here.
[07:27.33]Ooh!
[07:29.73]I just accidentally... Space or right mouse button, view clipart.
[07:32.95]It actually is clipart.
[07:34.77]View previous.
[07:36.41]Move clipart.
[07:37.61]1 to 9.
[07:38.41]Change distance.
[07:39.56]Clipart is moved.
[07:43.36]Backspace removed.
[07:44.38]V is flip.
[07:46.16]H is flip.

[07:51.64]Exit.
[07:52.88]Oh.
[07:58.85]Okay, so, uh, we're gonna have to, we're gonna have to lower it out.
[08:01.85]We have to lower it out.
[08:03.17]And I, if I just leak the rest of the fucking game, who cares?
[08:05.83]You didn't even look.
[08:06.37]Don't look up there.
[08:07.13]Don't peek at your presence.
[08:08.15]Alright, let's do, uh... Legs 1.
[08:18.04]No, I need body.
[08:23.88]Actually, I kind of like this one.
[08:33.05]Alright, how about headgear?
[08:38.98]Lego hair?
[08:39.50]I'm just gonna stay out of the menu.
[08:42.36]It doesn't really matter.
[08:43.12]I gotta bring this down.
[08:49.82]Is that a clown nose?
[08:53.08]Okay, that's like a clown horn.
[08:56.10]Uh, okay, so you got a clown horn.
[09:04.25]Let's do... What about arms?

[09:44.07]Look at how easily entertained he is.
[09:48.07]Am I?
[09:49.29]Look, he's going up there to honk the nose.
[09:57.00]This is so stupid.
[09:58.80]You're right, this sucks.
[09:59.86]But who cares?

[10:05.66]The tabs, Jerma, the tabs.
[10:07.28]It's already leaked.

[16:57.35]It's alt W. Move the cursor over the word to.
[17:04.07]Okay, hold on.
[17:17.37]What does alt W do in Chrome?
[17:22.55]What does alt W do?
[17:29.00]It's control W?
[17:36.62]It depends on your add-ons.
[17:38.10]It presses alt W.
[17:45.67]It closes the tab.
[17:57.69]It doesn't do anything.
[17:59.60]God damn it.
[18:07.94]Alt W. No, oh well.
[18:12.40]We could've got a funny voice out of this one.
[18:17.46]Alt-T?
[18:18.00]I did Alt-T.
[18:19.14]It opened up another Google tab.
[18:28.52]Alright.
[18:29.44]Oh, well.
[18:35.64]Alt... Yeah.
[18:36.80]Well, what else can... Yeah.
[18:38.36]Alright.
[18:38.68]Let's get out of this one.
[18:39.48]Alright.
[18:40.71]This one sucks.
[20:39.36]When did I mute?
[20:42.61]Oh, it's this Mario.
[20:43.89]It's... okay.
[20:50.33]This kind of hurts my ears.
[20:59.62]You've muted the whole stream.
[21:00.90]That would suck.
[21:05.73]Why would you need 80 lives?
[21:11.14]80!
[21:12.92]Okay, now we only have 79 lives left.
[21:14.70]What are we gonna do?
[21:17.00]The game is hard?
[21:17.82]Can I just get one enemy killed?
[21:30.12]Aren't they lobsters?
[21:39.42]No, they're lobsters or crabs in one of the games.
[21:42.70]That's not made up.
[21:49.10]Yes, yes, I'm correct.
[21:49.99]I know.
[21:51.07]That's a fucked up pixel.
[21:52.09]That was stupid.
[22:01.85]I hit it.
[22:02.49]I actually hit it.
[22:05.40]You even saw the thing go up.
[22:15.44]You can't... Actually see... Alright, this is not like Mario Galaxy that has the minigame that they've... You know what?
[22:30.49]I'm not even gonna explain it.
[22:31.53]I just got so angry that I couldn't even explain what I was trying to say.
[22:39.03]Long story short, it's fucking hard to control.
[22:42.27]And I was about to go off on like a rant about how they've remade this like 10 times.
[22:47.58]This is the VGA version.
[22:51.38]I got stuck.
[22:52.16]I got mad stuck.
[22:55.82]I was just like... Playing Golden Axe.
[23:13.24]Oh, okay.
[23:15.84]EGA?
[23:17.18]CGA?
[23:19.35]Tandy!
[23:24.53]What is the Hercules graphics adapter?
[23:26.65]Should I do Hercules?
[23:27.61]Does that mean it's the best one?
[23:29.03]Alright, Hercules.
[23:29.75]I can't do any of these.
[23:47.29]Why can't I do anything?
[23:55.86]Click on the screen?
[23:56.66]Yeah.
[23:59.55]That's not doing anything!
[24:01.01]Numpad?
[24:06.31]No.
[24:06.55]Numpad's not working either.
[24:10.20]Alright, how do I do it?
[24:11.88]Golden Axe is a... Golden Axe, Golden Axe, Golden Axe.
[24:14.69]Golden Axe, Golden Axe.
[24:16.43]First player use WASD.
[24:20.81]Great job.
[24:21.33]Here are a few things.
[24:22.25]Important.
[24:22.97]Entering 1.
[24:24.87]Command prompt.
[24:27.01]Faded color password.
[24:28.71]Controls.
[24:29.94]Change the... That's probably why it has 200,000 views and only 400 favorites.
[24:43.13]Okay.
[24:44.35]Yeah, the numpad doesn't do anything.
[24:49.32]I pressed every number on my whole keyboard.
[24:53.66]It was archived a month ago.
[24:55.80]What the hell's going on?
[24:56.68]Hold on.
[24:57.54]Let me refresh the page.
[25:06.64]Got it.
[25:11.11]Oh, that looks horrible.
[25:13.55]What did I press?
[25:18.65]Please open your manual to page four.
[25:20.35]Find the word in the lower right and type it below.
[25:22.62]God damn it!
[25:28.68]What is it?
[25:29.24]Somebody has it down here.
[25:33.73]Type any word to get through the password request.
[25:36.51]Is it seriously?
[25:45.38]Okay.
[25:45.62]Uh, we're gonna do Arcade.
[25:56.45]This looks like when Game Boy decided they were gonna put color on Game Boy.
[26:18.13]Okay.
[26:26.07]Okay, every button on the keyboard doesn't work.
[26:31.50]Only... How does left and right work, but not anything else?
[26:38.04]What?
[26:42.65]What are the controls?
[26:47.46]W... Up?
[26:48.88]W, X, A, D?
[26:52.75]S is attack.
[26:55.17]Q, diagonal.
[26:56.23]Q, E, Z, C. Tab.
[26:58.25]Okay.
[26:59.09]So it's S. Tab is jump.
[27:12.55]Alright, dude.
[27:13.33]What the fuck is going on here?
[27:22.82]What the fuck is going on here?
[27:26.32]This one don't work.
[27:29.08]RTGameCraft just came in with a huge raid right now.
[27:34.05]What's up dude?
[27:34.73]Thanks for the raid!
[27:35.91]Welcome everybody.
[27:36.53]We're currently reading the manual.
[27:40.23]It's an exciting stream here today.
[27:41.98]Reading the manual for how to press enter in a 25 year old video game.
[27:49.48]I'm not sure what you're up to, but thanks for the raid.
[27:51.68]Welcome everybody.
[27:54.41]Exciting shit today.
[27:57.40]Okay.
[28:00.44]Now, can we see some... Can we see some fucking pogchamps in the chaplet?
[28:05.71]First play WASD.
[28:08.55]Great... Great job.
[28:10.19]Alright, but how do I... On the modern keyboard, is it...
[28:19.35]Fuck it, we gotta go.
[28:20.03]We just had a raid come in, we gotta go Number Munchers right now.
[28:23.95]I can't fucking stall.
[28:31.65]Yeah.
[28:34.95]Number Munchers.
[28:37.71]Alright, play Number Munchers, Hall of Fame.
[28:39.61]Let's go to options.
[28:41.39]Difficulty level.
[28:43.07]Third grade.
[28:44.67]There, it goes up to eighth grade.
[28:46.27]Wait, hold on.
[28:48.39]How many grades are there?
[28:50.65]3rd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 5th, 6th, 6th.
[28:52.31]Oh, advanced and easy.
[28:53.65]Alright, let's do 3rd grade.
[28:56.57]Set content.
[28:58.65]Multiply.
[28:59.69]Multiples.
[29:01.03]Use.
[29:04.04]Challenge.
[29:04.52]Yeah, whatever.
[29:05.30]It doesn't matter.
[29:07.32]We'll just go with the default.
[29:12.20]Okay, erase Hall of Fame.
[29:13.46]Alright, we're good.
[29:17.86]Play Number Munchers.
[29:19.67]Do you want instructions?
[29:20.47]Yeah, just to give you a quick little refresher.
[29:22.67]Our hero, Number Muncher.
[29:24.21]Munchies Digits.
[29:26.05]Munchie... Munchicus Digitus.
[29:31.59]This is Reggies, Smarties, Bashfuls, Workers, and Helpers.
[29:36.63]We have to be careful of these.
[29:40.10]Alright, to call timeout and freeze the game, press enter key, press it again to resume play.
[29:44.60]Yeah, this squares.
[29:47.03]Okay, use the arrow keys to move the muncher.
[29:50.53]You could also use the spacebar to eat a number.
[29:53.48]Yep.
[29:55.20]You may want to quit in the middle of a game.
[29:57.00]If so, pressing the escape key will end the game.
[29:59.06]Imagine Rage quitting number munchers.
[30:02.86]Okay, let's go.
[30:06.59]Equality.
[30:11.37]Two times, what does it want me to do?
[30:14.03]Equals one.
[30:14.79]This one equals one.
[30:16.49]This one equals one.
[30:22.39]This is really easy.
[30:27.75]Which one of these equals one?
[30:29.21]I'm only in the third grade.
[30:30.87]Alright, what am I missing?
[30:38.76]equals one nine divided by nine eight seven six five four three two one that's it that's it that's it oh he's actually struggling no I'm not actually struggling I'm actually just
[31:04.35]I win.
[31:05.73]Alright, what equals two?
[31:07.86]Two times nothing?
[31:10.32]Two.
[31:10.96]One.
[31:11.76]Two.
[31:13.24]Two.
[31:15.16]Two.
[31:16.46]Two.
[31:16.80]Got it, got it.
[31:18.32]One times two is two.
[31:25.31]Why are you giving me the answer?
[31:26.91]I should know this.
[31:28.69]Oh no, he's eating them!
[31:31.48]Alright, equals 2 equals 2.
[31:32.58]2 divided by 1 is... That doesn't... That's a .5.
[31:36.08]That's not even right.
[31:36.76]6 divided by 3.
[31:39.70]That's gonna be 3 divided by 6.
[31:40.60]Doesn't make any sense.
[31:44.20]No, that's 1.
[31:44.71]Don't... It's trying to fool me.
[31:48.43]4, 8, 12, 6, 20, 24.
[31:49.13]That's 6.
[31:51.29]3.
[31:52.87]1 plus... There it is.
[31:53.97]I thought that was a times.
[31:54.65]2 divided by... Got it.
[31:59.23]Equals 3.
[32:04.78]Yeah, put me in the fucking third grade.
[32:06.24]I would destroy this.
[32:12.73]Well, yeah, that's Mr. Elbertson.
[32:17.43]See, he stayed back 25 years.
[32:25.10]He's incredibly disruptive.
[32:32.96]We're in three minus zero, that's- that- you can't do that!
[32:36.69]Hey, teach!
[32:37.27]You can't do that!
[32:41.65]Mr. Elbertson, please.
[32:44.01]Just play your video game.
[32:45.27]Oh, a video game?
[32:55.54]Almost got killed, almost got killed.
[33:00.80]Alright, I'm gonna go to like the 8th grade after this and see how it is.
[33:03.28]3 divided by 1.
[33:05.58]3 minus 0, that's just, right?
[33:07.26]I thought it was gonna- What, are we talking negative numbers here?
[33:09.46]What the fuck?
[33:10.00]0 minus 3 is negative 3.
[33:21.91]Whatever it is, I don't know.
[33:22.91]Who cares?
[33:43.95]Mr. Elbertson.
[33:45.17]Yeah?
[33:47.47]What is it?
[33:48.91]You can't just open Doritos in class.
[33:51.71]Why not?
[33:53.91]Shit, what the fuck you teach?
[34:01.56]Oh, that's two.
[34:07.99]Four, eight, twelve.
[34:08.73]It's four...
[34:11.13]No, that's two.
[34:12.35]Damn it.
[34:13.75]There it is.
[34:20.36]I did it.
[34:23.90]What the fuck was that?
[34:26.81]What just happened?
[34:27.67]Why was that happening?
[34:30.61]Did I skip the cutscene?
[34:31.73]No, I didn't.
[34:40.86]I didn't skip the cutscene.
[34:45.28]Don't eat my shit, get out of here.
[34:54.46]This is actually going to get very, very embarrassing in about two more levels or so.
[35:01.49]You're gonna see just how long I've been out of school for.
[35:04.99]And that's the thing I know a lot of you guys say, How does he fuck this up?
[35:08.07]I know all this.
[35:09.51]I have not been in a classroom in almost 20 years.
[35:14.19]You know what I mean?
[35:14.65]Like, you may have been in a classroom like yesterday.
[35:17.74]I haven't been in a classroom in like 15 fucking years.
[35:23.08]You know, I don't think about this shit.
[35:26.14]I don't think about like what 36 divided by 9 is.
[35:28.72]What do I care?
[35:33.73]Once we get to the hard ones, it's going to be guessing.
[35:37.67]4 divided by 4 is 1.
[35:42.33]3, no.
[35:42.55]3, 6, 9, 12.
[35:44.15]There it is.
[35:44.63]5.
[35:44.69]Okay.
[35:44.99]This...
[35:58.20]5, 10, 15, 20, 20.
[35:59.32]Okay, 25 is the one that's... Okay, this is gonna get ugly.
[36:01.90]It's gonna get actually very ugly.
[36:04.08]What?
[36:04.56]Oh.
[36:05.52]I pressed the wrong button.
[36:06.40]No, I didn't... I wanted to get... I didn't make it out of the third grade.
[36:18.67]You got to... No, I don't want that to be listed.
[36:24.39]I don't know, fucking Zach.
[36:32.49]no I don't want to play that again let's do this one okay we're gonna do we'll do equality again no no I know I want to go harder yeah hold on alright options difficulty third grade advanced this time so
[36:58.39]I'm sitting at the front of the classroom, paying attention to everything the teacher is doing.
[37:03.97]Let's see what advanced third grade is.
[37:09.76]I think I could do this.
[37:10.46]I think I'll be okay.
[37:13.44]I think so.
[37:16.32]What's your superpower?
[37:18.28]I can fly.
[37:19.49]Cool.
[37:19.83]That's like a Superman thing.
[37:20.83]What's your superpower?
[37:23.07]I can manipulate water.
[37:26.13]Nice.
[37:26.45]What's your superpower?
[37:28.57]Advanced third grade.
[37:30.45]Oh.
[37:31.08]Ooh!
[37:32.12]Good, good, good, good, good, good!
[37:37.94]Multiples?
[37:38.86]Oh, no.
[37:43.12]I don't even know what any of this is.
[37:45.60]Oh, by the way, just to give you guys some lore here, I don't know how to do fractions.
[37:50.25]I pretended to the entire time I was in school.
[37:52.71]I got almost every math test like an F on every single fraction.
[37:56.05]I didn't even care to learn it.
[37:58.21]When there is a recipe that calls for like 1 7th of something or like 2 6th or like 2... I have no idea.
[38:06.76]I need a cup to tell me.
[38:09.72]I got like zeros on every single test that was a fraction.
[38:13.24]I don't even do them.
[38:14.38]I don't even use them.
[38:16.48]I work in whole numbers, okay?
[38:22.32]Let's just do multiples.
[38:25.10]Multiples of two.
[38:26.16]This is the fucking easiest thing you could have done all day.
[38:28.26]What do you mean time out?
[38:33.73]That's not a two.
[38:34.51]Oops.
[38:36.45]Okay, the controls are a little weird.
[38:39.77]Why would I do that?
[38:42.07]Why would I ever hit that number?
[38:51.21]Multiples of three.
[38:52.51]Oh no!
[38:53.19]This is gonna get so bad.
[38:54.63]No, I tried to hit the 15!
[38:58.10]I gotta slow down because if you go too fast, it'll just fuck the whole thing up.
[39:13.92]multiples of four, this is, and I know some of you, I'm pausing it right now because I know there's a shitload of people in this chat right now who are leaning back in their chair and they're going, fuck, once you go five or six denominations high on the multiples, I don't know what they are.
[39:30.35]And I know a shitload of you are doing that right now.
[39:34.93]You know, like, oh yeah, I know my multiples, like six, six, 12, 18, 24, 32.
[39:42.27]38, 39, 40, 41, 42.
[39:42.53]I know it.
[39:43.45]You can't lie to me.
[39:44.29]Where are we?
[39:44.97]4?
[39:45.01]Look at all these 20s.
[39:45.89]4, 8, 12, 16, 20.
[39:46.79]4, 8, 12, 16, 20.
[39:46.95]4, 8, 12, 16, 20.
[39:47.05]4, 8, 12, 16, 20.
[40:18.64]Get it.
[40:18.92]I got it.
[40:26.87]Does this kill him?
[40:36.97]Holy fuck.
[40:37.73]That's graphic.
[40:38.99]His bones going through his head.
[40:42.09]Holy shit.
[40:56.38]Multiples of two?
[40:57.50]Wait.
[40:57.70]Did I just level up?
[41:07.07]I leveled up!
[41:08.13]Alright, well I want to get another cutscene before I stop.
[41:13.27]5th grade?
[41:13.71]Oh no, I'll do 8th grade.
[41:15.58]I will.
[41:16.00]Just to see if I'm even remotely capable of doing 8th grade math.
[41:19.76]I'm not.
[41:20.58]There's no way I am.
[41:23.22]I already know.
[41:24.20]I have to do some breathing exercises for the next few minutes.
[41:27.46]Because I know... Like, I'm gonna be looking over the chat, and I'm gonna be fucking mad that people are making fun of my 6th grade education.
[41:37.72]You know what I mean?
[41:38.18]I'm gonna be like, I gotta be ready for it.
[41:39.78]I gotta be ready, because I know I'm not gonna do well.
[41:43.07]And I'm going to look over there and it's going to be like, holy shit, he's so stupid.
[41:46.98]There's no way he's this stupid.
[41:49.60]How does he drive a car?
[41:51.92]And I'm going to be like, fuck, I can't.
[41:54.33]God damn it.
[41:55.29]Shut up.
[42:13.88]Oh my god.
[42:15.68]Why would you be happy to see, like, the charred remains of somebody that just exploded?
[42:19.73]What the fuck is wrong with this person?
[42:21.03]What's wrong with this guy?
[42:22.07]Alright, let's go.
[42:32.24]Whoa!
[42:32.54]It's getting harder.
[42:33.14]Uh-oh.
[42:35.40]They've introduced a new enemy type.
[42:36.78]4, 8, 12, 16, 20.
[42:37.76]4, 8, 12, 16, 20.
[42:38.06]Where is it?
[42:46.40]Move.
[42:49.39]Oh shit, he ate me.
[42:58.85]I did it, okay.
[43:00.07]Five.
[43:07.28]What a classic game, by the way.
[43:08.56]I could sit here for the next six months and do this.
[43:12.68]Multiples of two.
[43:16.68]Actually, really, really fucking easy.
[43:18.81]Like, it's very easy.
[43:20.85]Watch out.
[43:21.19]Wait, wait, they're getting faster, though.
[43:22.45]Alright, how does this person die?
[43:30.92]Now he's gonna go check on it, and it's gonna crush his skull.
[43:47.87]alright this is easy let's let's go let's go to let's go to the fifth grade right we have to do fifth grade or should I stay well I'm gonna I lost it's fine this is we're gonna go to the fifth grade we're gonna skip a couple grades I'm good enough I know I know my multiples of three two and five we're gonna go to the fifth grade we've leveled up
[44:18.86]Difficulty level.
[44:20.16]Fifth grade easy.
[44:25.82]Sounds good to me.
[44:31.63]Okay, how about equality?
[44:36.55]Three.
[44:36.89]Alright, this is the third grade.
[44:40.27]Oh no, this is the fifth grade.
[44:45.36]Not bad.
[44:46.32]It's not bad.
[44:53.85]That's four.
[45:02.92]Alright, this is not going as bad as I thought it was gonna go.
[45:06.76]I thought this was gonna be way, way worse.
[45:10.98]Equals, uh-oh.
[45:13.34]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, okay.
[45:17.26]It's fun-ty.
[45:20.16]Five, ten... Yep, that's correct.
[45:25.31]No shit, that was RNG dog shit.
[45:27.67]Get out of here.
[45:38.06]No, that's not it.
[45:39.04]That is... What?
[45:42.76]Four times four is 16,400?
[45:43.88]Is it?
[45:44.82]No, it's fi... I don't think that's accurate.
[45:59.77]What are they teaching our children?
[46:07.12]No, that's 21.
[46:07.76]You'd love to see that.
[46:13.60]No, don't say it.
[46:14.56]I'm not even going to do it.
[46:18.86]That's 10.
[46:21.50]Thanks for the help.
[46:22.36]That's not even right.
[46:25.10]Hold on.
[46:26.10]Here. 20.
[46:38.94]That's 24.
[46:39.86]16.
[46:41.56]Is that it?
[46:52.99]No.
[46:53.23]2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.
[46:55.21]2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.
[46:57.75]No.
[47:04.14]What?
[47:04.78]I didn't even see that.
[47:05.96]I would have got that immediately.
[47:06.92]Equals 4.
[47:10.74]No, I thought it was times.
[47:11.76]Okay, I can't lose in the fucking fifth grade on easy.
[47:16.01]I actually have to be careful now.
[47:22.23]Seven, six, five, four.
[47:25.85]Three, four, five, two, four.
[47:30.83]Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four.
[47:32.80]Don't go up, he's gonna go up.
[47:37.50]Two, two, two, four.
[47:40.02]8.
[47:40.16]There we go.
[47:40.86]This is what I'm talking about.
[47:44.43]8, 16, 24, 32.
[47:44.57]Got it.
[47:46.43]What?
[47:47.25]No, I thought it was 5.
[47:50.46]Do it again.
[47:50.80]Do it again.
[47:51.08]Do it again.
[47:51.34]Do it again.
[47:51.74]Do it again.
[47:52.04]Do it again.
[47:52.32]Do it again.
[47:52.62]Do it again.
[47:52.90]Do it again.
[48:19.20]Dumber than a 5th grader.
[48:22.80]This is 10.
[48:24.98]It's tricky, though.
[48:26.18]It is.
[48:27.06]And look, let's give a little bit of credit to the children that are doing these math problems.
[48:31.50]It's hard to do this.
[48:32.78]It is.
[48:33.93]Can we give some credit to some 4th graders in this chat, please?
[48:39.45]Dude, I just lived in the wrong time.
[48:41.11]You know what I mean?
[48:42.13]If I was back in the 1400s... We don't do math.
[48:50.00]Math didn't exist!
[48:50.96]What would I have done in, like, the 1200s?
[48:53.89]I don't know.
[48:58.19]I would have been, like, fucking... I would have had a farm or something.
[49:02.05]I'd be dead.
[49:10.01]Why would I be dead?
[49:20.01]The plague.
[49:21.79]You have my colitis.
[49:27.24]Wait a minute.
[49:28.38]I wouldn't be dead?
[49:29.30]Because I have colitis, so I'd be dead.
[49:39.93]You might be.
[49:40.59]Yeah, but I don't have to worry about numbers.
[49:46.14]I would just live my life.
[49:47.87]There'd be no, like, iPhones.
[49:51.09]There'd be no computers.
[49:58.91]You just... You just walked around town and talked to people.
[50:02.61]That's what you did.
[50:05.74]You just, like, walked around.
[50:07.72]I'm really good at that.
[50:09.36]I would be great back in, like, the 12, 1300s.
[50:11.78]You just walked around town.
[50:16.21]What is this, 14?
[50:22.47]NPC.
[50:23.07]Yes, that's what people did.
[50:25.83]You worked like on the farm and then you just walked around town or you were like a guard.
[50:34.62]Or you ran an inn or something.
[50:37.36]I would just be guy that sits at table in inn.
[50:40.06]They needed tons of those people.
[50:53.17]What are we doing?
[50:54.07]14?
[50:55.24]Oh, I don't know.
[50:55.94]I don't know.
[50:56.72]I know these ones.
[50:59.03]I don't know these ones.
[51:01.09]Is this it?
[51:02.25]It's 14 right there.
[51:05.74]28, no, that's not correct.
[51:06.68]10, 8, 12, 8, 16, 24, 30, no, that's not even close.
[51:07.44]7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, that's 12.
[51:08.26]6, 12, 18, 14.
[51:08.72]What is this one?
[51:09.38]Is this it?
[51:10.00]No.
[51:10.08]5, 10, 15, 20, 23, 34, 45, 56, 57.
[51:10.98]You all had to do that.
[51:11.52]Once you get past 60, I will not hear this bullshit that you guys can do that over fucking 70 or 80 decimals.
[51:37.36]Oops.
[51:40.80]What's the last one?
[51:45.48]That's 16.
[51:45.64]28 and 2.
[51:45.92]Yeah, that's correct.
[51:47.50]60, 8, 6 and 84?
[51:47.68]Nobody can do that in their head.
[51:50.78]6, 12, 18, 6, 12, 18, 24, 32.
[51:51.72]32, 10.
[52:09.23]It's not that hard.
[52:10.07]Yeah, because you were just in math class like fucking four hours ago.
[52:23.30]Fuck, I didn't even mean to press that.
[52:30.59]You know the last time I was in math class? 2000.
[52:35.47]The year 2000 was the last time I saw numbers situated like this.
[52:45.50]I got a farm to take care of.
[52:47.44]Why do I need to know what equals 14?
[52:48.81]Oh.
[52:48.87]We're good.
[53:03.91]14 rows of corn.
[53:04.83]I don't count!
[53:06.95]I just dump all the seeds in there and wait six months and then pull them out of the ground!
[53:11.22]Oh no, it's over.
[53:22.84]Once we go higher than like 13, 14, 15, 16 is when... No way.
[53:25.51]There's no way I'm gonna do this.
[53:34.20]Okay, get the easy ones.
[53:35.24]I have no lives left either.
[53:37.35]21.
[53:43.41]That's it.
[53:53.05]Hey, guys.
[53:55.63]You know, it's, like, funny, I guess, in a way.
[53:59.00]It's, like, kind of funny.
[54:01.46]But, like, him pretending to not know how to do, like, fifth grade, like, multiplying and stuff.
[54:07.27]Like, that's... He's better than that, isn't he?
[54:10.63]Like, I don't know.
[54:11.23]I just feel like I'm...
[54:20.15]Like, I caught the stream for like 10 minutes and I just, like, he's just doing this, like, I'm fucking stupid act thing where I can't do fifth grade math.
[54:30.91]Has he really gotten that low in regards to what he's pretending he can't do?
[54:40.16]Now if you'll excuse me.
[54:44.02]I have world hunger to solve.
[54:47.46]And I have a line of microscopes I have to look into to see how many fucking microorganisms are inside of my piece of bread that I do every day.
[55:00.11]I'm like a bread microscopic person.
[55:02.04]Yeah, I'm pretty smart.
[55:17.09]Why would you ever do that?
[55:18.97]You're like weird.
[55:20.73]You're fucking weird if you do that.
[55:22.85]Why would you put bread under a microscope all the time?
[55:25.59]Why are you doing that?
[55:26.75]Stop doing that if you do.
[55:35.94]No, it clicked.
[55:36.98]It clicked.
[55:38.28]It clicked on it.
[55:39.36]Wait, that's correct.
[55:40.48]No, it's not.
[55:46.12]Alright, I gotta get out of this game.
[56:02.22]I gotta get out of this game before people really start to become concerned.
[56:19.47]Alright, just lose, just lose, just lose, just lose.
[56:23.05]I want to see what the 8th grade looks like.
[56:25.43]8th grade advanced.
[56:26.15]Let's see if I can get one question right.
[56:28.29]And then we can move on.
[56:31.51]8th grade and above.
[56:35.00]I wonder if I can get one question correct.
[56:44.80]Okay, primes, equality, factors.
[56:48.94]Factors of 66.
[56:52.40]What?
[57:00.01]That's... Okay.
[57:00.95]I can do this one.
[57:07.29]Oh.
[57:08.77]That's not a factor.
[57:15.14]Is 10 a factor of 66?
[57:16.02]Nope.
[57:22.08]8?
[57:22.10]1?
[57:22.12]11, right?
[57:25.02]Yeah.
[57:25.90]It's just what can make 66 eventually.
[57:29.07]This is how that works.
[57:32.13]Is it 8 or is it 26?
[57:32.61]26?
[57:32.63]46?
[57:32.67]I'm not just guessing.
[57:33.85]Factors of 51.
[57:50.18]Okay, yeah.
[57:52.08]51.
[58:11.17]Yeah, just 1 and 51.
[58:12.46]That's what I was thinking.
[58:14.74]It's a lot more than that though.
[58:20.02]Seven?
[58:27.09]Seventeen?
[58:29.89]Doesn't know pee pants.
[58:33.09]No, and I don't even care.
[58:37.60]Some people would probably get really upset about this.
[58:41.38]Oh, sorry.
[58:43.66]Sorry, scientists in the chat.
[58:45.40]I don't know what every factor of 29 is.
[58:50.22]That's the thing that you say that you know and somebody goes, alright.
[58:54.30]Anyways, so about the reports that you owe tomorrow.
[58:58.98]What do you mean there's only two?
[59:02.55]No, there's not.
[59:11.53]Any scientists in the chat?
[59:15.09]Hey, go examine some bread while you're at it.
[59:19.57]Check it for E. coli or whatever you're doing.
[59:21.53]Is there only two?
[59:33.96]Oh, there's a barbecue!
[59:38.30]We're eating numbers.
[59:39.36]Um.
[59:50.24]That's incredibly dangerous.
[59:51.52]I could have gotten hurt there.
[59:56.12]Factors of 67.
[59:56.81]I know every factor of 67.
[60:09.09]Okay, cool.
[60:12.52]You're ruining our cruise.
[60:14.50]Can we just enjoy ourselves, please?
[60:23.94]um 13 no two four who said four you said four you said four I looked somebody said four some of you I saw somebody said four I'll I got them yes they did yes they did yes they did yes they did somebody said four at least two people said four
[61:02.42]I don't know what a prime number is.
[61:12.04]Well, it was gonna be, it's any number that can be like divided by itself, right?
[61:16.94]Something like that, that can go into itself.
[61:19.32]Divide by, multiply by itself.
[61:20.94]It's something like that, I don't know.
[61:22.10]I don't know, why do I need to know what a prime number is?
[61:27.54]It doesn't even, that doesn't even matter.
[61:32.12]Cut the camera to like a close-up of my mother's face crying.
[61:39.03]He was supposed to be an accountant.
[61:40.69]He was supposed to know.
[61:44.27]I want him to know these numbers.
[62:01.69]He's mad?
[62:02.63]I'm not mad.
[62:03.43]Hey, don't... Don't get mad.
[62:10.10]Get even.
[62:13.30]11's not a prime number of 91.
[62:14.60]No, this is... Wait, this is not prime numbers anymore.
[62:17.90]This is not prime numbers anymore.
[62:19.46]This is different.
[62:20.50]This is different.
[62:23.64]Oh, shit.
[62:24.14]I didn't know we were on a different thing.
[62:30.62]Alright, last try, last try, last try, then I'm done.
[62:32.50]For real.
[62:32.88]I swear to God.
[62:33.36]Eighth.
[62:36.20]Okay, Prime numbers.
[62:36.94]It's two.
[62:41.16]The only reason why I know this is because this is how many days it takes for that package to get there that you order from Prime.
[62:47.14]That's the only reason why I know that.
[62:53.94]Greater than nineteen.
[63:03.20]Because I said the word Amazon What Amazon joke -2 what is it Amazon Prime Was it too easy
[63:29.63]But if I say, why don't you go ahead and sub with your Twitch Prime?
[63:33.16]But that's funny.
[63:49.62]Let's play Star Wars.
[63:56.81]It would if you said it unironically.
[64:02.21]That's alright.
[64:02.67]I know that we're all on the same page with our math abilities, so it don't matter.
[64:06.56]Alright, this is F1 to toggle mouse, keyboard... Let's do... I guess... Is this a flying game?
[64:20.41]Princess Leia's Rebel Force.
[64:23.79]Okay.
[64:26.87]Select a Death Star.
[64:28.49]Fire laser at desired Death Star.
[64:32.07]What?
[64:48.84]Okay, uh, mouse control.
[64:52.44]Good.
[64:57.15]How many Death Stars do they have?
[65:10.68]Shoot the fighters, shoot fireballs, shoot... Shoot the Death Star!
[65:14.30]Did I get it?
[65:25.85]This is actually pretty good for a game that came out... in like 1983.
[65:28.93]Don't I shoot it inside of the hole?
[65:39.79]Where's the hole?
[65:40.79]Exhaust?
[65:45.86]Did I get it?
[65:48.78]Exhaust port.
[65:49.44]What am I- What's shooting at me?
[66:10.15]I think I just have to dodge, right?
[66:19.11]Shoot the- Got it.
[66:24.27]Death Star destroyed.
[66:34.28]Alright, this one, I don't want to click this one yet because I'm going to get stuck here for a long time.
[66:39.48]So we're going to play this one.
[66:40.82]This one's called The Elf's Christmas.
[66:47.87]This is called The Elf's Christmas Adventure or God...
[66:57.10]So this is what happens when Santa calls you out of retirement.
[67:00.04]You had wondered what it felt like to be subjected to Baron Justice von Liebig's teleportation methods.
[67:08.07]Well, now you have experienced it firsthand.
[67:10.47]You remember when you were very young and the wisest, oldest elf was summoned.
[67:14.35]The mirror in the Great Christmas Hall is still cracked to this date.
[67:19.33]Never had such an emergency required such drastic measures.
[67:24.08]Would you like to read the instructions?
[67:25.20]Yes.
[67:48.62]The Elf's Christmas Adventure game understands a wide variety of commands.
[67:52.52]However, it has only limited vocabulary, so it can get confused.
[67:56.10]If you give it a word that it doesn't understand, it will tell you what word it doesn't know.
[68:01.31]Try entering your command again using a different word in place of the one the game you objected it to.
[68:06.59]Your commands should generally be in the format verb, multiple noun phrase, preposition noun phrase, object.
[68:15.08]Some hypothetical examples of valid commands.
[68:18.80]Place a red rock in the small bowl.
[68:22.63]Put the green rock and the small pebble behind the oak tree.
[68:26.71]Read my poetry book.
[68:29.07]Swim in the swimming pool.
[68:30.41]Examine the golden ring.
[68:31.97]Attack him.
[68:34.19]Get all.
[68:34.97]Examine the keys.
[68:35.99]Push the button.
[68:39.74]Okay.
[68:41.90]Why is there attack him?
[68:46.13]Alright, turn the doorknob, then enter the cave.
[68:48.83]So you do like then and and and the.
[68:51.47]Okay, I get it.
[68:52.03]So you can type help, gives you a hint, and then inventory will display a list of the items you're currently carrying.
[69:00.64]Okay.
[69:02.50]Holy shit, this is an elaborate save.
[69:05.12]Oops, will allow you to edit your previous input command.
[69:09.88]List exits look verbose.
[69:17.01]Causes output to go to both the screen and a printer.
[69:26.58]The alt key and the up arrow causes a north command.
[69:30.76]Oh my god.
[69:33.12]I thought this was going to be just a short little fun Christmas game.
[69:37.49]This is Dungeons & Dragons rules.
[69:43.99]Do not.
[69:45.53]Oh.
[69:46.75]Do not what?
[69:48.63]I did it.
[69:52.74]Octagonal room.
[69:57.16]Remember that you can turn the sound on and off by giving the command sound on and sound off, respectively.
[70:02.60]Alright.
[70:06.24]This is what I'm listening to right now.
[70:16.06]Hold on a second.
[70:17.99]I need to like do this.
[70:20.37]Let me put on like actual Christmas music.
[70:31.10]Okay.
[70:34.98]You are in an octagonal room filled with hundreds of elves.
[70:39.26]Each of the elves is identical and all seem to move in unison.
[70:43.43]You stare at the elf directly in front of you.
[70:46.01]He stares back.
[70:47.83]You feel an itching in your nose, which builds and builds until... Achoo!
[70:52.77]The entire room of elves sneezes simultaneously.
[70:56.13]Why?
[70:56.73]Why would you... What now?
[71:07.44]The entire room of elves echoes your sneeze.
[71:10.08]Achoo!
[71:12.52]Sneeze again.
[71:14.38]Sneeze again.
[71:18.52]Such behavior would be most unbecoming of a Christmas elf.
[71:24.53]Cough.
[71:26.31]I don't understand cough as a verb.
[71:28.53]How about, um... Get up.
[71:34.55]Um... Look.
[71:37.09]There's barely enough room to turn around here.
[71:39.03]If there was anything to find here, you'd surely be standing on it.
[71:42.67]Octagonal room.
[71:44.89]There's an elf directly in front of me.
[71:46.63]Talk.
[71:48.97]Talk to elf.
[71:53.35]Sorry, but you don't have time to be messing around with the elf.
[71:56.28]You have a very important mission to help Santa save Christmas this year.
[71:59.10]Please try to devote your energies and your mind to the task at hand.
[72:04.60]Octagon.
[72:05.80]Okay.
[72:08.16]Feel.
[72:11.34]Eat elf.
[72:14.51]Eat the elf?
[72:15.15]You must be kidding.
[72:27.50]Such behavior would be unbecoming of a Christmas elf.
[72:32.96]Walk.
[72:35.11]Leave.
[72:37.29]Exiting doesn't seem appropriate right now.
[72:50.54]Damn, being an elf sucks.
[72:53.46]Right.
[72:57.67]You yell.
[72:59.59]Your voice echoes loudly through the area, and the volume of your shriek causes the very ground to vibrate.
[73:09.79]You feel much better having let out some steam.
[73:14.35]But nothing has changed.
[73:21.59]You can't talk or leave, so what inventory?
[73:25.45]You aren't carrying anything.
[73:27.47]Grab toy.
[73:31.12]Grab desk.
[73:34.86]Work.
[73:40.20]Make toy.
[73:42.42]You don't have time to be messing around.
[73:43.79]So what am I supposed to do?
[73:53.99]That's right.
[73:54.53]You're here to help Santa.
[73:55.79]What a smart elf.
[74:05.56]I think it is work.
[74:18.46]Everybody sneezes at the same time.
[74:19.78]That probably means something.
[74:25.02]look down I don't understand as the object look up look at elf he sneezes as you look at him what is going on what's this sneeze back um is this how we communicate
[74:53.50]Stand.
[74:54.34]Stand up.
[74:55.80]Stand.
[74:58.41]Grab tissue.
[75:04.39]Alright, um, ten seconds.
[75:07.31]Look at floor.
[75:08.35]You see nothing unusual.
[75:09.75]Look at elf.
[75:11.34]He sneezes at you.
[75:12.38]Look at chair.
[75:15.10]What chair?
[75:15.56]There's no chair.
[75:16.26]We're standing?
[75:18.96]Look at ceiling.
[75:22.90]Look at desk.
[75:25.40]There's no desk.
[75:26.16]What?
[75:26.40]We're just all standing in a room?
[75:34.41]Go to Santa.
[75:36.51]What Santa?
[75:37.29]There is no Santa here.
[75:42.01]Look at mirrors.
[75:45.82]Look at...
[75:56.52]Santa.
[76:00.08]How do I have minus 50 points?
[76:02.27]Hint.
[76:06.05]Walk east.
[76:07.63]What, uh...
[76:27.04]Uh, look west.
[76:30.48]Look in room.
[76:33.54]What room?
[76:34.08]There's no room.
[76:34.90]Where are we standing?
[76:38.32]Are we outside?
[76:41.95]Look outside.
[76:53.97]Make toys.
[76:56.15]You don't have time to do that.
[76:57.25]You have a very important mission to help Santa save Christmas.
[77:10.52]Look at ground.
[77:14.26]If there's anything to find here, you'd be standing on it.
[77:26.48]Where is Santa?
[77:31.09]Look at shoes.
[77:35.45]Mirror room.
[77:36.07]The elves are just you.
[77:40.78]Move feet.
[77:44.24]You're in a mirror box.
[77:45.42]Yeah.
[77:46.56]What?
[77:54.13]That's not what that is.
[77:56.21]That's not... Okay, I'm fucking out of here.
[78:04.70]Next.
[78:05.86]Next.
[78:09.06]Okay, we've got... What's up here?
[78:15.91]Uh, we have... Why do I have two SimCities?
[78:20.97]Which one is bitter?
[78:23.95]SimCity and then SimCity Classic.
[78:30.61]Just play it twice.
[78:31.49]Which one's better?
[78:35.91]Just play them both and see which one's... Just do like a review.
[78:41.83]Alright, we'll do SimCity Classic.
[78:51.67]Start New City.
[78:55.32]Uh, I don't, I don't, I never played SimCity.
[78:59.26]Medium?
[78:59.94]Medium.
[79:04.64]I have no idea what any of this is.
[79:05.80]This is such a mistake.
[79:07.44]This is a mistake.
[79:08.18]I have no idea what any of these buttons do.
[79:14.57]Okay, city.
[79:15.21]I don't even know where we are.
[79:16.55]Okay, so this is a zoom in.
[79:21.51]I'm assuming I gotta make roads.
[79:24.83]What does this do?
[79:27.81]Funds, $10,000 more residential domes needed.
[79:30.17]Power grid city form.
[79:31.57]Okay, residential.
[79:36.94]Can't build on that dust pool.
[79:41.08]Residential.
[79:45.66]It needs power.
[79:56.48]Does that work?
[80:04.03]Does that work?
[80:04.39]Does that do it?
[80:11.33]Thank you, Red Lemonade, for the 10 community subs.
[80:18.12]Thank you, Red Lemonade.
[80:20.90]I've never played SimCity.
[80:26.68]This is a mistake.
[80:36.10]So how do I make a power plant?
[80:39.40]Nuclear gravity?
[80:40.69]A nuclear plant?
[80:45.95]This is an old version.
[80:47.19]Yeah, it is.
[80:47.91]Do I have to connect the nuclear power over here or something?

[104:08.67]R.I.P.
[104:09.73]Here lies a brave miner.
[104:10.97]He died with his tool in his hand.
[104:12.41]For the love of sweet Miss Mimi, his bank account was $1130.
[104:17.01]Imagine setting your bank account on your gravestone.
[104:31.06]That would be really fucked up.
[104:39.53]Okay, I want to try that again.
[104:41.15]I want to try again.
[104:44.57]This is fun.
[104:49.91]VGA miner.

[105:16.48]Okay, got some silver.
[105:21.08]The mine is caving in on you.
[105:22.52]You lost some silver.
[105:25.50]Oh, fuck off.
[105:31.34]Sandstone.
[105:32.08]Easy digging.
[105:40.14]Dumbass trying to dig granite.
[105:42.82]Alright, I haven't found anything.
[105:45.38]Okay, this silver.
[105:50.30]Silver.
[105:53.66]How much money do I need?
[105:55.32]Can I sell the silver?
[106:00.58]More silver.
[106:03.24]Okay.
[106:03.54]Alright, go back in the elevator.
[106:15.99]Is the bank?

[106:28.10]Enter.
[106:28.42]Okay.
[106:29.24]E. Welcome to the community bank.
[106:33.36]We're pleased to assay for you.

[106:40.40]Okay.
[106:41.88]So I have today's quotes.

[106:47.99]I have A, G. A, G is silver, right?
[106:49.92]Okay, let's get some silver.
[106:51.68]Cash in all your minerals.
[106:52.84]A. This is a net loss.
[107:05.32]Okay, cool.
[107:08.12]How do I leave?
[107:11.62]How do I get out of here?

[107:14.21]B?
[107:17.72]You lost money.
[107:18.72]Yeah, I gotta find gold or platinum.
[107:22.60]Isn't X quit to DOS?
[107:28.16]No, that's not okay.
[107:32.04]So digging costs money and I don't have any- this is- I'm just operating at a horrible loss.
[107:39.71]Here be dragons, here be dragons, here be dragons!
[107:48.97]Oh shit.
[107:53.81]What the fuck?
[108:00.64]Give me some platinum!
[108:06.04]It costs... It costs $20 to dig, and I don't even get $20 for silver if it's in one box!
[108:16.75]Volcanic tough digging.
[108:28.03]What happens when you run out of money?
[108:35.12]Your bank account just goes negative.
[108:42.18]Oh, that's what happens.
[108:47.06]You go into debt for 15 seconds.
[108:49.86]Alright, I'm doing it again.
[108:51.99]I'm doing it again.
[108:52.91]I'm going all the way.

[109:43.55]Let's leave the store.
[109:45.77]I now have better equipment.
[109:48.24]Let's go down here.
[109:57.38]Alright, how do I use the dynamite?
[110:01.18]Why is dynamite?
[110:02.95]Let's do it.
[110:06.37]Found gold!
[110:08.71]Okay, here we go.
[110:09.73]Why?
[110:11.31]You need a torch.
[110:12.23]I can't just... I can't light the dynamite.
[110:19.43]Further?
[110:19.79]I can't.
[110:20.05]I gotta pay a hundred bucks to go further.
[110:30.27]Okay, sell it.
[110:30.91]Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell.
[110:33.13]Sell gold.
[110:34.71]And get thing for dynamite.
[110:38.80]Why do I like this game?
[110:40.88]I don't know why.
[110:42.52]Cashing my minerals.
[110:45.16]Ooh, that's pretty good.
[110:47.46]That really wasn't bad at all.
[110:54.63]Okay.
[110:55.41]Go in here.
[110:57.48]And let's get a torch.
[111:00.18]I'm assuming F is torch.
[111:02.46]Be careful with fire.
[111:04.94]I will.
[111:08.32]You like this, but you hate Minecraft.
[111:10.06]Wouldn't I say that?
[111:10.78]I love Minecraft.
[111:18.41]Okay.
[111:18.53]This game's alright.
[111:22.39]I'm gonna go here.
[111:23.23]I'm gonna go... Oh!
[111:25.77]What's that?
[111:26.69]Oh.

[111:54.66]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[111:55.84]I'm going back up.
[112:07.46]You blew up the minerals.
[112:09.38]Did I, though?
[112:11.44]Come on, one more.
[112:16.36]You found trac- The game did- I just opened up the whole game.
[112:21.96]I just got platinum, guys.
[112:24.02]Yeah.
[112:29.51]You're ignoring the silver?
[112:31.13]Am I?
[112:31.35]Let's see what happens if I sell all this shit.
[112:38.15]What we got?
[112:39.94]Oh, yeah.
[112:40.94]New minerals.

[113:34.76]No, I'm not going there yet.
[113:37.76]Not necessary.

[113:57.51]Oh, okay, no.
[113:57.89]Alright, let's go.
[113:59.47]What is this?
[113:59.89]What is C?
[114:00.35]What's a corkscrew?
[114:11.86]I can go down further.
[114:12.64]By the drill, will that automatically start doing things for me?
[114:18.20]Oh shit, we can keep going.
[114:20.18]How many, what did I get?
[114:21.72]60, 60 feet?
[114:23.48]This doesn't cost money to keep going, right?
[114:25.10]Alright, here we go.
[114:30.53]Don't get killed by that.
[114:31.85]Alright, water exists down here.
[114:38.83]What do I need the water for?
[114:43.74]Come on, give me something.
[114:45.82]Here we go.
[114:46.94]Light it.
[114:53.16]It's to hydrate?
[114:55.44]That doesn't- no.
[114:56.05]You don't do any of that.
[114:58.57]Oh shit!
[114:59.01]Okay, watch it.
[115:08.27]You can keep going left?
[115:09.20]Alright, don't blow all your money.
[115:13.46]Get up, get up, get up, get up.
[115:15.60]Where am I?
[115:16.32]Okay.
[115:24.75]Fuck.
[115:25.47]I have 39 health.
[115:29.96]Get up, up.
[115:33.16]Why is there so much water down here?
[115:39.66]Platinum, Platinum.
[115:40.28]Alright, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[115:42.28]Back in the elevator.
[115:42.98]In the elevator, in the elevator.
[115:44.64]In the elevator, in the elevator.
[115:45.70]Come on, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[115:46.78]I have 29 health.
[115:51.60]One more, like, nugget and I'll be fine.
[115:55.75]Come on, one more nugget.
[116:02.27]Alright, good.
[116:06.30]He's being greedy.
[116:07.30]No, I got it, I got it.
[116:08.20]I got another Platinum.
[116:22.90]Okay, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[116:26.71]He's avoiding the ones with the minerals.
[116:28.17]Because that happened.
[116:31.89]Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell.
[116:38.84]Alright, what do I got?
[116:40.30]A lot.
[116:41.46]Okay.
[116:44.76]Cash it in.
[116:49.67]Now I do need to heal.
[116:54.51]It's going to take seven and a half days for me to be healed.
[116:58.49]So that's 700 days, $700.
[117:02.88]Stay one day and one night.
[117:08.18]Oh man, that's horrible.
[117:21.59]I want to upgrade my tools.
[117:26.13]You got the money, though?
[117:27.01]Yeah, but I don't want it.
[117:29.37]Okay, so if I press B, is that going to give me a better axe?
[117:35.88]No, I already have it.
[117:36.66]Okay, C. A durable drill.
[117:39.02]Did I just buy it all?
[117:42.50]D. It's a lantern.
[117:45.44]E for the water.
[117:48.03]I got every... Okay, I got it all.
[117:53.14]Let's go get a bucket of water.
[117:54.32]See what that does.
[117:55.90]Why is this not open yet?
[118:08.17]It's a cute drill.
[118:09.13]Let me fill up the water.
[118:10.85]P, it's P, right?
[118:14.70]Press the direction.
[118:15.74]Ooh.
[118:15.90]Okay.
[118:18.64]P.
[118:25.95]Oh, it just gets rid of the water.
[118:27.37]I get it.
[118:30.52]So what does the corkscrew do?
[118:37.84]Drill granite.
[118:39.46]Alright, so it's D. D. Oh, that costs... Look at how much money that costs!
[118:54.38]That's $200 to do that.
[118:59.76]That's not worth doing.
[119:01.42]At all.
[119:01.94]That's not worth it.
[119:04.17]Why would I even use that?
[119:12.81]It's $200 per drill.
[119:14.01]That's horrible.
[119:14.65]Alright, let's do some water here.
[119:30.07]What?
[119:31.63]What happened?
[119:32.17]What?
[119:32.55]What happened?
[119:33.01]What happened?
[119:33.83]What?
[119:40.91]Wait, it's a hundred and it was a hundred and fifty dollars a pump?
[119:48.17]It costs money to use the bucket.
[119:51.51]To put your hands in water and throw what?
[119:53.65]What?
[120:06.84]God damn it.
[120:08.97]I'm so sad.
[120:09.65]Okay, we're going to play Dune 2.
[120:15.23]And then we're going to open it up to the people to vote here in a minute.
[120:27.35]Uh-oh.
[120:27.63]Uh-oh.
[120:28.19]Uh-oh.
[120:28.67]Uh-oh.
[120:29.01]Uh-oh.
[120:29.47]Uh-oh.
[120:29.85]Uh-oh.
[120:34.43]We're good.
[120:35.99]And... Virgin Games.
[120:38.05]This is Dune.
[120:39.31]D-U-N-E.
[120:41.14]Dune 2.
[120:45.00]Not Doom 2.
[120:46.50]A lot of people just went, Oh, come on!
[120:48.54]I thought you were playing Doom!
[121:04.11]What about it?
[121:17.64]He didn't read the book?
[121:18.58]No.
[121:19.58]I didn't read the book.
[121:21.32]The spice controls the empire.
[121:25.42]Is this the one with the big worms in the ground?
[121:27.12]Whoever controls doom controls the spice.
[121:32.19]No, that's Tremors.
[121:39.35]The emperor has proposed a challenge to each of the houses.
[121:45.69]Is this how the book goes?
[121:46.99]The house that produces the most spice will control doom.
[121:53.23]There are no set territories and no rules of engagement.
[121:59.15]So it's the purge.
[122:01.14]Only you have to bring like cumin.
[122:13.44]now three houses fight for control of doom the noble atreides are those alive that seems very impractical for a plane to do that I didn't see this movie that was a seagull plane
[122:48.26]There is no movie.
[122:51.94]There's not, there's not, there's a movie, right?
[122:53.88]There's only a book?
[122:57.70]There are like, yeah, there's like three movies.
[123:01.06]There's no movie.
[123:05.36]Alright, is this a click and point adventure game?
[123:09.45]Is this a shooter game?
[123:10.47]Is, what is this?
[123:14.17]Battle for Arrakis.
[123:16.99]Play a game.
[123:25.68]Select your house.
[123:28.54]Alright, we got Gryffindor, Slytherin, and... The Ram.
[123:38.31]I'm gonna be... Well, isn't the way this works?
[123:44.35]If you say that you're Slytherin, you're actually Hufflepuff.
[123:48.35]And if you say that you're Gryffindor, it means you're actually Ravenclaw.
[123:53.43]That's how that works, right?
[123:57.05]And if you say that you're Hufflepuff, you're actually Slytherin.
[124:04.97]This is the cool one to say that you are.
[124:07.09]I'm Slytherin.
[124:08.87]I don't play by any fucking rules.
[124:11.06]Yes, you do.
[124:24.42]I can't select?
[124:25.00]Let's go.
[124:34.02]Alright, where did we land?
[124:35.82]Home planet of the Atreides has a warm, calm climate and the lands are lush and green.
[124:43.30]Okay.
[124:44.58]What about it?
[124:46.53]That defines spices?
[124:50.41]The rich soils and mild weather supports an extensive variety of agricultural activities.
[124:56.97]In recent centuries, industrial and technological development has added to the prosperity of the Caladanian people.
[125:04.09]Do you wish to join House Atreides?
[125:06.79]Not yet, no.
[125:07.97]No, not yet.
[125:09.55]I wanna see the other intro.
[125:10.47]House Ordos.
[125:14.23]House Ordos.
[125:15.63]The home pla- It's like, icy and cool looking.
[125:17.68]The home planet of Ordos is a frigid and ice-covered world.
[125:20.46]We presume the Ordos import their agricultural and technological goods from nearby star systems.
[125:26.90]Acting as traders and brokers, the Ordos produce no physical products of their own and rely upon their merchandising skills to survive.
[125:36.53]That sounds pretty interesting.
[125:37.41]I might be an Ordos.
[125:39.09]Alright, what about the Harkonnen?
[125:41.42]House Harkonnen.
[125:43.95]This is a big fireball.
[125:45.75]From the dark world of Gedi Prime, the savage house Harkonnen has spread across the universe.
[125:51.53]A cruel people, the Harkonnen are ruthless towards both friend and foe in their fanatical pursuit of power.
[126:10.52]I am Mentat Radnor.
[126:13.58]With my guidance, you may be able to assist us in conquering this dusty little planet.
[126:23.05]Okay.
[126:24.37]For your first test, you will be expected to produce 1,000 credits and not a granule less.
[126:31.49]You may earn credits by harvesting spice and will need to build a refinery to convert spice to credits.
[126:37.76]Okay.
[126:38.36]Harvest spice, refinery convert spice.
[126:42.21]If any of our foolish enemies attempt to attack your base, you will have the pleasure of seeing the invincible Hakkonen troops in action.
[126:54.83]Oh, it's an RTS.
[126:58.77]Okay.
[127:00.77]Construction yard.
[127:01.61]Is that there?
[127:02.69]Build this.
[127:03.83]Build it.
[127:07.19]Mentat.
[127:08.17]Oh, I have to... Okay.
[127:08.73]Okay.
[127:11.31]Small construction slab.
[127:15.13]Wind trap power center.
[127:20.31]There isn't enough open concrete to place the structure.
[127:22.55]You may proceed, but without enough concrete, the building will need repairs.
[127:26.23]No, don't do that.
[127:26.89]Do I already have a construction yard?
[127:28.27]Um... Can I select a unit?
[127:36.03]There we go.
[127:38.73]Okay, move.
[127:39.11]Move.
[127:43.86]Go look over this way.
[127:45.98]Affirmative.
[127:47.52]This map is tiny.
[127:50.12]Okay, build construction facilities.
[127:52.96]All structures are built by the construction facility.
[127:55.12]Got it.
[127:55.38]Alright, let's do... No, no, no, no, no.
[127:57.70]I didn't want to do that.
[127:58.30]Oh, shit.
[128:00.39]Alright, I want a slab.
[128:10.79]Small concrete slab.
[128:12.11]Construction complete.
[128:14.45]Place the slab over... here?
[128:16.72]Where should I put this?
[128:22.22]Cannot place the foundation here.
[128:24.26]Concrete.
[128:24.94]Use concrete to make a sturdy foundation for your structures.
[128:31.63]Where?
[128:44.19]Is this one person?
[128:51.58]Alright.
[128:55.74]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[128:57.42]Uh, just... Get over there.
[129:00.84]Construction yard.
[129:01.48]Okay, so now I can do... A power center?
[129:05.35]It takes... Alright, no, no, no, no, no.
[129:07.93]I get it, I get it.
[129:08.51]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[129:09.25]I get to build four of these, don't I?
[129:12.01]I have to go like... It has to sit on a slab, right?
[129:26.45]All the Zooms in chat hating this game.
[129:31.87]Oh, I see.
[129:37.29]He's getting it.
[129:37.97]He's getting it.
[129:38.57]He's so stupid.
[129:39.19]He's so stupid.
[129:40.15]He's so stupid.
[129:54.22]I need a thousand credits, right?
[129:55.50]Does it have to start harvesting stuff?
[130:03.26]Oh, stupidity again.
[130:04.06]Dumb fuckity again.
[130:04.76]Stupid fuckity again.
[130:13.32]The wind trap supplies power to your base.
[130:15.08]Without power, your structures will decay.
[130:16.90]I have power info needed.
[130:21.25]Outputs a hundred.
[130:25.53]Alright, why don't you go, like, over here?
[130:31.97]Start, like, exploring.
[130:33.73]We need to find resources.
[130:39.13]You go up here.
[130:40.89]Alright, I need to... How do I... Oh, shit.
[130:49.63]Oh, shit.
[130:50.39]Oh, shit.
[130:50.79]Oh, shit.
[130:51.05]Oh, shit.
[130:51.51]Oh, shit.
[130:51.73]Oh, shit.
[130:52.03]Shit.
[130:52.23]Shit.
[130:52.43]Shit.
[130:52.79]Attack.
[130:53.09]Attack.
[130:53.35]Attack.
[130:58.55]No, don't shoot your own guy.
[130:59.83]Over here.
[131:00.47]Get him!
[131:03.06]Alright, what'd I get?
[131:13.92]Oh, I got a new pink.
[131:14.98]Spice Refinery.
[131:16.20]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[131:18.84]Slabs.
[131:28.80]Oh shit.
[131:29.80]Dude, look at these fucking actions per minute.
[131:36.32]Seven.
[131:36.50]Can't place the foundation, why?
[131:38.64]Good, good, good, good.
[131:59.18]This is actually kind of fun.
[132:03.05]I would love to play this online versus, like, six people.
[132:06.85]Try pressing M for move.
[132:12.45]Well, that's good.
[132:13.15]A for attack, I'm assuming, too.
[132:14.41]Alright, what do I need?
[132:17.11]I need, like, three?
[132:18.31]Six, right?
[132:24.16]That's six.
[132:25.58]Alright, keep on building this shit.
[132:31.74]The PSX version is cleaner.
[132:36.05]Yeah, this is old, old, old, old, old, old.
[132:39.85]Very old.
[132:51.30]We got hotkeys, boys.
[132:52.78]This is real RTS.
[132:55.34]Alright, let's get the spice refinery on there.
[133:04.96]They improved a lot with Red Alert.
[133:06.80]Yeah.
[133:12.41]You can feel the Red Alert.
[133:13.95]You can feel the Command and Conquer in this.
[133:17.81]That, like, affirmative.
[133:19.33]Affirmative.
[133:19.81]I think it's the same voice, just with a higher bitrate.
[133:24.19]Come on, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
[133:34.69]Red Alert could be the best RTS I've ever played.
[133:38.70]It was such a mess.
[133:39.60]I loved it.
[133:41.16]I might play that one day.
[133:43.48]That game is a fucking mess.
[133:45.68]It's crazy how nuts that game can get.
[133:50.28]Convert spice into credits.
[133:54.02]What's that?
[133:54.50]Oh, okay.
[133:55.80]Alright, we go.
[133:56.18]Get the spices going.
[134:00.08]Search for spice fields to harvest.
[134:04.00]Alright, what does the spice field look like?
[134:08.40]Alright, move.
[134:09.44]I need to find the spice field.
[134:11.10]Damn, I want to play Red Alert, like, right now.
[134:15.02]It's like riding a bike, too.
[134:16.34]I remember everything.
[134:17.95]I remember everything.
[134:19.17]Having, like, 10 construction yards.
[134:21.75]Like, 20 Tanya's.
[134:23.15]Like, 100 power plants.
[134:24.81]I remember building power plants into other people's bases to just put Tesla coils all over this inside their fucking base.
[134:32.56]I'm playing that, like, soon.
[134:37.51]Like real soon.
[134:44.53]That just scratched the itch in my brain.
[134:46.81]I can't wait to play that.
[134:48.45]Do it now?
[134:49.23]No, no, no, no.
[134:50.15]Can't do it now.

[135:32.59]I love that game.
[135:34.68]I'm so happy that I ended up playing this because it reminded me of how just dumb fun that game is.
[135:45.96]Is multiplayer still working that game?
[135:50.05]Does it?
[135:50.49]Anybody have any idea?
[135:52.03]There's no way it does.
[135:53.11]Not even close.
[135:53.81]No way.
[136:01.07]You have to do a lot of specific things.
[136:04.91]The original version doesn't work anymore.
[136:07.53]I'm gonna do some research and figure this out, because... If we could, like, get, like, a... How many people could play in it?
[136:18.60]There's an open red alert.
[136:19.56]Alright.
[136:20.82]This is not a virus.
[136:23.19]Oh, I can't wait.
[136:24.77]I love that game so fucking much.
[136:27.43]I'm so excited.
[136:28.49]You have no idea.

[137:16.94]They are.
[137:17.52]They are.
[137:17.82]I would agree with you.
[137:21.13]I really would.

[138:40.68]Hold on, let me like, let me switch out like rose-colored glasses.
[138:55.94]Almost there.

[141:10.19]How do you swing?
[141:32.60]Okay, A, S, W, D, E, R. This game's sick, actually.
[141:37.71]This is one for the Genesis.
[141:38.75]I mean, the Super Nintendo one is 1,000 times better.
[141:43.05]But this is the Genesis one.
[141:45.37]Q. Space is jump.
[141:49.99]Alt.
[141:51.23]Okay, Alt and Control.

[142:46.25]No!
[142:47.09]No, that's not the end.
[142:51.26]This isn't bad for DOS.
[142:53.46]No, it's not.
[142:55.48]It's actually pretty good.
[142:57.40]Wow!
[143:23.48]Wow.
[143:31.92]Oh, his pants fell down!
[143:33.04]Haha!

[143:46.37]What a loser.
[143:57.24]Alright, go up.
[144:00.14]Aren't there bosses in this game?
[144:23.11]What was the last good licensed video game?
[144:25.69]I don't even remember.
[144:29.75]I mean, actually good licensed video game.
[144:37.27]Spider-Man for PS4?
[144:40.74]That's true, that's true.
[144:41.92]Yeah, that's true.
[144:43.66]Yep, that game was awesome.
[144:45.00]That was fucking awesome.
[144:47.02]That was very, very good.
[144:49.08]But like, take Movie.
[144:51.57]Comic book is, you know, you can make a good comic book.
[144:54.17]There's been a lot of comic book character games that have been very good.
[144:56.39]Uh, what about TV show or movie, though?
[145:02.14]Spider-Man.
[145:02.68]Yeah, but Spider-Man's a, like, that's a Marvel character.
[145:06.52]That's not, like, based on the movie Aladdin.
[145:09.66]Like, Spider-Man PS4 was not, like, Spider-Man Homecoming the video game.
[145:14.76]Right?
[145:29.24]Return of the King, Lord of the Rings.
[145:31.54]Oh, that game was awesome, you're right.
[145:34.46]Those Lord of the Rings games were... I'm playing those too!
[145:37.80]I'm playing those games too.
[145:39.98]Those games were awesome!
[145:41.60]Oh man, I'm remembering... Gandalf and the Two Towers game?
[145:48.26]Those games are so good.
[145:50.24]Alright, write it down.
[145:51.48]I'll forget that.
[145:52.00]Somebody write it down.
[145:54.16]That's the one with the huge combo meter, right?
[146:03.87]This sounds like sarcasm.
[146:08.53]It is.
[146:08.81]Those games suck.
[146:09.78]I'm kidding.
[146:10.72]Alright, I gotta pay attention to this game.
[146:19.70]No, I really love those games.
[146:20.98]Because when you get the combo meter to keep going... Oh, man.
[146:25.56]Nothing will ever replicate that feeling.
[146:53.40]Keep making him reminisce about old games till he plays Minecraft.
[147:01.95]That's not that old.
[147:07.25]Wait, is this... I remember this game had the cool genie level, right?
[147:12.91]They were very similar.
[147:14.37]This one and the Super Nintendo one were similar, but the genie level in the Super Nintendo one was not very good.
[147:18.32]This has a much cooler genie level, the SEGA Genesis one.
[147:21.12]I remember...
[147:23.82]Oh my god, I'm a- This game's so- This game's so good.
[147:28.56]Oh, somebody write it down that I have to play this one.
[147:30.12]If I play that song, will I go to prison?
[147:54.28]No, no, no, no, no.
[147:55.38]No, no, no, I'm gonna die.
[148:05.22]No dying.
[148:12.61]This whole VOD is prison.
[148:14.65]No, it's not.
[148:26.04]How do you leave this level?
[148:28.66]Oh!
[148:29.26]Alright, what do you get?
[148:31.34]What do I do?
[148:35.42]Five.
[148:36.02]Wish.
[148:36.36]Ten.
[148:36.50]What do I have?
[148:40.27]How do I buy something?
[148:43.35]It's a deal.
[148:43.89]Alright, well I got an extra life.
[148:56.00]Come on, Gwen!
[148:58.18]No.
[148:58.58]Alright, that's not that far away.
[149:12.97]There's a boss right here, isn't there?
[149:29.16]Alright, here comes the boss.
[149:31.56]I remember this.
[149:33.50]Never mind.
[149:35.30]Is the game running at 75% speed?
[149:37.24]Look at all this screen tearing.
[149:41.40]Look, you can't... What am I doing?
[149:48.94]What am I pressing?
[149:49.62]Awww.
[149:56.56]The desert.
[149:59.60]Turn on the desync.
[150:02.62]What song is this one?
[150:08.34]I'm serious, somebody write down the two towers again.
[150:11.34]Because I'm just going to get them.
[150:15.73]How long is the speedrun for this game?
[150:23.29]Turn down four what?
[150:23.99]What does that mean?
[150:25.51]What are you saying when you're doing that?
[150:26.59]What does that mean?
[150:36.46]Screen tearing.
[150:37.94]Yeah, this is how we used to have to play games back in the fucking 80s.
[150:40.60]Uh-oh.
[150:44.85]Froze.
[150:52.53]Oh, dude, you know another game?
[150:58.86]Listen to this game.

[151:05.95]Are you ready for this?
[151:08.45]I'm gonna say... Like, three words, and you're gonna drop your fucking steak and cheese sandwich.
[151:17.60]Mickey's Magical Quest.
[151:20.26]For Super Nintendo.
[151:21.00]Remember that game where you went to the firefighter game?
[151:24.51]Where you did different costumes and shit, and you had, like, the...
[151:33.24]Put that on the list, too.
[151:37.06]Oh, by the way, we're playing all these tomorrow.
[151:49.13]No, we're not.
[151:51.33]My fucking chicken sandwich just landed on the ground.
[151:59.09]Who's calling me?
[152:03.67]How do I kick it over there?
[152:06.27]Castle of Illusion HD remake.
[152:08.11]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[152:10.03]That's not the magical quest starring Mickey Mouse.
[152:17.51]It's the Capcom one.
[152:18.89]That one was insane.
[152:21.93]I'll beat that whole game on stream.
[152:23.13]I don't care if it takes me all day.
[152:32.19]No, get...

[154:23.38]Was that for the Super Nintendo one, or was that for this one, the one that was SEGA Genesis?
[154:26.36]What's going on?
[154:26.94]Jump over that.
[154:28.60]I guess I can't.

[165:44.28]Where are we going?
[165:54.19]Yogi Bear Visits the National Parks, Yahtzee, and Zookeeper.
[166:03.97]It looks like it's going to be Yogi Bear Visits the National Parks.
[166:13.98]Zeppelin.
[166:15.34]Giants of the Sky.
[166:19.12]It seems like we're going to Yogi Bear.
[166:24.01]Thank you for voting.
[166:32.57]Oh, this looks crusty.
[166:43.38]This is what it looks like if you punch the top of your computer really hard.
[166:53.28]Okay.
[166:54.15]Insert disc two.
[167:01.09]Yogi Vervit's The National Parks.
[167:02.63]Do you need instructions?
[167:04.13]Yes, I actually do.
[167:06.67]Yogi is happily dozing beneath a tree when he awakens to find that Boo Boo has gone.
[167:12.10]He yells at Boo Boo to come back, but it's too late.
[167:15.66]You will play the part of Yogi.
[167:17.42]It is your job to locate Boo Boo with the ranger's help.
[167:21.02]All you know now is that Boo Boo is in one of the national parks.
[167:24.68]You must use the park maps and have the ranger use his radio and computer to locate Boo Boo.
[167:31.09]Then you must fly to the park and pick Boo Boo up if he's still there.
[167:35.17]Good luck.
[167:38.89]Okay, Yogi Berra and the National Parks instructions.
[167:43.26]When a message appears above the ranger's head as you walk Yogi back and forth, you can press enter to perform the action.
[167:49.56]When the message, you see something below appears, you must land on one of the safe landing pads to discover what it is.
[167:56.82]When the fuel low message appears, you must fly back to the ranger station landing pad before your fuel runs out or you will crash.
[168:07.42]Okay.
[168:13.39]Uh, Yogi, I'm gonna go for a walk today.
[168:16.35]Okay.
[168:18.28]Have a good time.

[173:42.54]Okay.
[173:43.77]This is South Dakota.
[173:45.17]Strong winds blow in and out of the cave.
[173:47.33]There are yellow, pink, blue, and brown calcite crystal formations in the cave.
[173:52.32]So we have to prove that we know where this is.
[173:54.80]So we say just calcite, right?
[173:58.98]We go to Wind Cave, we say, hey, calcite.
[174:04.77]And he'll let us go.
[174:10.19]Nice picture.

[175:48.48]Boo-Boo's back!
[175:50.57]Why do they have to do this screen?
[175:52.41]Ow!
[175:53.51]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop it.
[176:02.66]That's the whole game.
[176:13.00]Okay, that was fun.
[176:22.01]Now what?
[176:27.55]Vuvu detected.
[176:33.39]Yahtzee or Zookeeper?
[176:37.62]Uh-oh.
[176:39.22]Uh-oh, it's torn.
[176:40.38]Imagine if that was $60?
[176:45.26]Hold on, my throat.
[176:50.88]That game was not $60.
[176:51.64]It was probably like $12.
[177:02.87]Important question.
[177:03.55]Would you rather have your current health problems you have for the next two years or have one kidney stone for one night?
[177:08.85]That one.
[177:10.98]I'd rather have a kidney stone.
[177:12.40]I'd rather do a kidney stone like three times in a row.
[177:14.80]Three days in a row.
[177:16.76]And just get it over with.
[177:17.96]Just get it over with.
[177:21.72]Alright, looks like we're playing Yahtzee.
[177:27.09]Yahtzee.
[177:27.79]This is text Yahtzee.
[177:30.73]There's no graphics in this.
[177:42.33]Okay, press any key.
[177:44.93]This is the game of Yahtzee.
[177:46.81]From one to seven players may play at the same time with each player's current status shown on the playing board, including total scores.
[177:54.29]The only difference between this game and the popular home game is that you may get multiple Yahtzees here.
[177:59.96]The first Yahtzee scores 50 points and each additional one will yield a bonus of 100 points.
[178:05.20]That just breaks the whole game.
[178:07.72]In addition, you will be given an extra turn at the end of the game.
[178:13.58]The winner will be... Let's go.
[178:15.68]Okay, fine.
[178:16.58]Okay.
[178:16.96]How many players?
[178:22.59]Two?
[178:24.63]That's the rules of Yahtzee.
[178:27.99]Play against chat.
[178:29.65]I can't do that.
[178:32.05]I'll play against myself.
[178:34.71]Do you wish to play against me?
[178:35.77]Yes.
[178:43.73]How many dice to roll again?
[178:53.66]I'm voting to veto this one.
[178:56.76]This is Mario Yahtzee, but 10 times worse.
[179:04.88]Let's do... I'm going 1, 2, 3.
[179:13.64]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[179:26.70]What are you... Huh?
[179:37.36]Veto.
[179:38.28]Sorry.
[179:41.50]I had to veto that.
[179:43.87]That was going nowhere.
[179:59.02]Zeppelin.
[180:00.30]Giants of the Sky.
[180:06.82]I would have to play Yahtzee again.
[180:10.32]Alright, we're gonna do Zeppelins.
[180:19.29]I don't think this game's actually good.
[180:23.35]Is it?

[181:06.62]No, this is not.
[181:26.54]I don't know who any of these people are.
[181:30.59]Alright, I'll play as this person.

[183:25.36]Alright, we'll do... Do you really want to cease production of the airship?
[183:30.50]Yes.
[183:35.98]I go back?
[183:42.14]Without an airship, not possible to put a new Zeppelin into service.
[183:44.88]Alright, well then put fucking five people on it.
[183:51.13]And let's have, I don't know, five scientists.

[203:58.15]Do you not get bored standing here?
[203:59.47]Have you ever seen a werewolf?
[204:00.69]I'd be silly, sir.
[204:03.05]There'd be no such thing as werewolves.
[204:05.29]I'd be thinking that a knock on your head has done damage.
[204:12.12]This, like, crusty audio.
[204:14.92]Can you open the gates?
[204:16.18]Certainly not, sir.

[204:50.73]No, I quite like it, actually.

[269:19.00]You are in total control of Hugo's destiny as he searches the haunted house for his sweetheart, Pelpy.
[269:24.53]She was last seen going into this house on a babysitting assignment.
[269:28.82]You may control Hugo's motion with the arrow keys or keypad.
[269:31.34]You may also give him simple commands to pick up or look at something which catches your eye.
[269:36.46]A very useful phrase would be, open the door on the first screen.
[269:40.22]For example, others are look and look at.
[269:44.14]Okay, be on the lookout for useful or valuable objects.
[269:46.70]They may very well help you in your quest for Penelope.

[270:12.04]This button will allow you to keep a game going in the background while you do your normal work in the DOS shell.
[270:18.96]Holy shit.

[273:19.46]How do you go back in the game?
[273:27.46]Oh, there we go.
[273:28.04]Okay.
[273:32.71]The mad professor speaks.
[273:33.81]Ah, there you are!
[273:34.65]I've been looking all over the house for you.
[273:36.63]Look, you're late and we haven't much time.
[273:38.37]Step into the box and we'll begin the experiment.
[273:42.17]The professor beckons you to step into the large cubicle in the center of the room.
[273:47.31]Who's the ogre?
[273:56.24]Good.
[273:57.50]Okay, Igor, press the blue button.
[274:00.66]Igor grumbles something incoherent and deftly presses the red button.
[274:08.14]You idiot, Igor.
[274:09.98]That's all I need.
[274:11.22]A colorblind imbecile for an assistant.
[274:14.94]Oh dear, I've got my headache coming on again.
[274:17.30]I've had enough hassle for one day.
[274:19.19]I'm going to have to lie down.
[274:21.97]The professor storms off, leaving you alone with Igor.
[274:26.55]They just made me smaller.
[274:27.87]Alright, let's talk to Igor.
[274:35.60]Igor.
[274:38.53]You ought to be aware that talking to oneself is... Talk to Igor.
[274:43.63]Igor is good at taking orders, but is not much of a conversationalist.
[274:50.73]Igor, press blue button.
[274:56.95]Igor presses the yellow button.
[275:02.99]There we go.
[275:07.90]Press the yellow button.
[275:11.62]Maybe he'll eventually press the right one.
[275:18.53]I think you better leave that.
[275:19.95]Igor, press yellow button.
[275:25.19]He presses the green button.
[275:30.60]Oh shit, that's not good.
[275:33.72]Igor, press green button.
[275:38.58]Now he presses the blue one.
[275:45.63]What did I do?
[276:08.39]Alright, let's go find the professor.
[276:09.43]Let's go wake the professor up.
[276:14.90]Open door.
[276:15.46]Oh, it's a bathroom.
[276:45.48]I'd rather not.
[276:49.88]23 of 190.
[276:50.02]Yeah, it's going pretty well.
[276:52.46]333.
[276:52.52]There appears to be something daubed on the mirror in red.
[277:00.89]It looks like the number is 333. 333.
[277:17.80]Alright, where's the professor sleeping?
[277:19.76]Is this a bed?
[277:20.28]What is that?

[280:58.76]Turn on light.
[281:01.82]I don't have any lights.
[281:02.62]I need a candle or something.
[281:07.19]Alright.

[357:15.37]Hold Alt.
[357:17.36]Just straight.
[357:17.92]What was that?
[357:21.70]Super Chex Armor.
[357:35.52]200% armor.
[357:36.22]That's pretty good.
[357:36.88]Alright, this is just a bunch of Beavises.
[357:41.75]That's all I hear.
[357:44.33]Even Scream, too.
[357:52.33]Alright, now I'm supercharged.
[357:59.71]I'm ready.
[358:01.18]I can't wait to fight the first boss.
[358:09.21]Why am I still playing this?
[358:10.21]I like this for some reason.
[358:12.54]I don't, but I do.
[358:18.52]Can I go higher than 200?
[358:20.62]No.
[358:24.03]Yellow key.
[358:26.75]It's a classic.
[358:27.45]Yeah, I guess it is.
[358:38.91]New weapon?
[358:39.87]Ooh!
[358:41.17]You got the Phasing Zorcher.
[358:42.55]Let me test it.
[358:47.32]Love it.
[358:49.48]Alright, I got yellow.
[358:54.24]What?
[359:08.84]Whoa!
[359:14.06]Teleporter.

[359:26.65]Whoa!

[359:41.95]YouTuber reaction.

[360:39.95]Uh-huh.
[360:43.55]Where is it?
[360:43.93]Didn't I try to switch this on?
[360:59.10]Power lifter.
[360:59.72]I have a map, do I?
[361:16.13]power lift that doesn't work giant enemy spider yeah I've seen a lot of people do videos on that what's going on there by the way why are people doing that tab is the map oh
[361:44.32]Something above this?
[361:47.78]It's... I just... That kind of came out of nowhere.
[361:52.35]From a video I made like six years ago?
[361:55.25]Seven years ago?
[361:56.03]Alright, I need to get the... I need to move this.
[362:07.90]Power lift.
[362:08.54]Power lift.
[362:09.14]I can't get it.
[362:16.43]Alright, where are we going?
[362:17.91]Ah, I see where I have not explored.
[362:20.97]That way.
[362:21.47]Come on.
[362:24.05]What are you doing?
[362:27.33]Giant enemy spider.
[362:30.13]I do like a Pokémon?
[362:33.15]Right?
[362:34.29]I'm getting this right, aren't I?
[362:43.61]Hmm.
[362:44.05]Hmm.
[362:44.21]Hmm.
[362:47.60]open oh you're dumb where am I not going this way
[363:23.47]I have no idea.
[363:28.59]Play the rest of the game like this?
[363:30.77]Um, I don't think I can.
[363:32.16]I guess I can.
[363:34.64]Uh, where do I need to go?
[363:37.30]Oh, shit!
[363:47.08]I found it!
[363:50.27]Got it.
[364:02.60]Swarm!
[364:09.24]Okay, I have to turn the stream off.
[364:10.34]Like, I have to get out of here.
[364:11.30]I have to turn the stream off.
[364:14.62]Do you know why I have to turn the stream off?
[364:20.21]Somebody?
[364:20.87]Why don't I turn the stream off?
[364:22.89]For what?
[364:30.68]Because I have to.
[364:33.54]I have to go and get Red Alert ready.
[364:38.78]I can't wait.
[364:44.97]I'm going to do a bunch of research.
[364:48.37]This is not even the right way to go.
[364:49.37]Use the wall.
[364:57.57]The wall.
[364:57.97]The wall.
[364:59.81]The wall.
[365:00.25]It doesn't open.
[365:02.33]Wait, what?
[365:04.75]What the fuck?
[365:08.19]Uh... Okay.
[365:17.22]Is this... That's the power loop.
[365:18.44]You don't need to turn it on.
[365:19.30]It's already on.
[365:24.98]I figured out why I don't like these things.
[365:27.49]Because this is what a monster looks like in your dream.
[365:33.51]This is a nightmare monster.
[365:36.48]You know when you have a dream about something that's not scary at all, but it is because it's real in your dream?
[365:42.94]This is what they look like.
[365:54.25]And it even looks like this in your dreams, too.
[365:58.88]All pixelated and strange and just doesn't make any sense.
[366:03.06]I've actually seen these green things probably in a nightmare before.
[366:07.66]And they're just so fucking weird and it doesn't make any sense.
[366:10.95]And they're not scary, but they're real.
[366:12.73]I don't like it.
[366:20.45]Yeah.
[366:24.03]Because you don't get a gun in your dream.
[366:27.19]You get like a dull pair of scissors that you drop five times.
[366:45.05]And you can't punch.
[366:45.91]No, it sucks.
[366:51.87]Alright, what?
[366:52.21]This is a secret door?
[366:54.97]What is this?
[367:00.34]You guys have had the dream where somebody's outside your house and you know they're going to come in and you know that the door is open or unlocked and you are rushing to try to lock the door and
[367:17.49]and you know that they're almost at the door, and you have to close the door.
[367:22.16]Not only does the door have to close, but lock too, because they can just open it.
[367:28.00]That's the worst thing in the world.
[367:29.14]It's one of the worst feelings you're gonna have in a dream.
[367:31.62]Is, here comes these guys, they're gonna come in and they're gonna kill me.
[367:34.53]They're coming in to kill me or do something terrible.
[367:37.11]I gotta close the door and I have to lock the door!
[367:39.57]And you get there and they're there and you don't turn the little thing.
[367:43.97]Or, this also happens in your dream, your lock sucks.
[367:47.87]And it doesn't hold them at all.
[367:49.64]They just kind of put a shoulder into it and it just opens.
[367:52.86]You have this little baby lock.
[367:58.50]Oh, that's the worst.
[368:02.62]Can I actually keep going?
[368:03.68]I didn't think I was going to end this stream getting lost in Chek's quest, but it happened.
[368:14.63]Yeah, I hate dropping shit in streams.
[368:22.89]It's the most annoying thing in the world.
[368:27.79]I wouldn't drop that that many times.
[368:29.54]I would not fumble around that many times trying to like run away.
[368:33.38]Your brain just can't do anything.
[368:36.30]Alright, blue door.
[368:46.01]I've told you this before.
[368:48.38]But it is worth mentioning again.
[368:51.84]Another strange thing about dreams, especially dreams that I have sometimes, is there'll be somebody in my dream that's supposed to be directly related to me or a close friend of mine, and it's not even them.
[369:03.05]I'll be walking around in my house or something, and my dad will be walking around.
[369:08.21]And it's like, oh, that's dad.
[369:11.47]No, my dad doesn't have a mustache and black hair.
[369:15.94]And that doesn't look anything like my dad, but that's dead.
[369:21.04]Why is that dead?
[369:21.81]Like that's just dead.
[369:23.07]No, it's not.
[369:34.89]Real dead.
[369:35.83]And then you start thinking about like, what are dreams?
[369:38.53]And am I like in somebody else's reality?
[369:41.13]Is this like a different life that I was in?
[369:44.28]And then you wake up and you go, I gotta call dad.
[369:52.72]It's past memories.
[369:55.39]It's my past emotions coming out.
[370:02.73]When I lived 400 years ago, my father had a mustache.
[370:09.73]I don't know where the fuck I'm going.
[370:22.14]I think I've had about enough of doom checks.
[370:26.80]I think I've had about enough.
[370:29.65]There's a door over here that I can't open.
[370:35.63]What is it?
[370:39.64]Why is this listed here as a door?
[370:43.58]See?
[370:48.86]You're in my dream?
[370:49.76]Yeah, but how many times have you guys had a dream about me and I have a mustache and, like, orange hair or something?
[370:59.32]Click the link.
[371:00.02]Click the link.
[371:03.28]Hold on.
[371:03.56]I don't want to accidentally show anything fucked up.
[371:07.80]What is it?
[371:10.96]I've seen this.
[371:11.68]Yeah.
[371:12.54]I've seen this.
[371:16.27]Alright, I'm done.
[371:16.91]That's it.
[371:17.31]The stream's over.
[371:17.97]I'm not doing Chex Quest anymore.
[371:24.83]Get this music out of here.
[371:28.11]That was pretty good, though.
[371:29.87]They got Rayman on here?
[371:31.17]Why didn't I just play that?
[371:36.11]They got Gremlins 2, the new batch, on here.
[371:38.29]Wait a minute.
[371:38.83]I'm not done yet.
[371:41.41]Did I try to play- I think I tried to play this last time, didn't I?
[371:46.67]Did I try to play Gremlins last time?
[371:54.37]No, I did.
[371:54.71]I played this.
[371:55.37]Did I?
[371:55.65]Yeah, I did.
[371:58.94]I did.
[371:59.26]I did.
[372:08.66]Yeah, I played it already.
[372:09.84]I remember playing it.
[372:10.97]God damn it.
[372:11.47]I did play it.
[372:11.99]Fuck.
[372:15.33]Show the image.
[372:15.99]I'm going to show it.
[372:16.63]Don't worry.
[372:20.55]Is this what I look like in your dreams?
[372:34.28]Remind me to never grow a mustache.
[372:45.49]I mean, the one on the left doesn't look that bad.
[372:48.69]I can't grow a mustache this thick, guys.
[372:51.18]This is never going to happen.
[372:58.50]Yeah, I do.
[373:01.86]Geraldo Rivera.
[373:10.87]That's a picture of Geraldo.
[373:16.89]Alright, Geraldo Rivera Young.
[373:19.25]Let's see.
[373:26.45]Does any pictures exist of Geraldo when he was young?
[373:30.45]No, none.
[373:36.85]Okay.
[373:40.20]It kind of does.
[373:40.92]It kind of does.
[373:41.46]Hold on.
[373:44.58]We need a side-by-side comparison.
[373:53.03]Wario?
[373:53.61]Yeah.
[373:57.41]There is some Wario in there.
[373:58.69]You're right.
[373:59.71]What did I just save it to?
[374:06.73]Why is it blending in with the background?
[374:07.94]I can't even see this.
[374:11.58]You know when you save a picture somewhere and you know you're looking at the right folder, but it just doesn't exist for some strange reason?
[374:24.28]You're certain that you know it's here?
[374:25.71]Okay, got it.
[374:48.03]You would think this was not the top one.
[374:50.01]The top one's not even close.
[375:05.54]You look older in the other picture.
[375:10.38]Yeah, I do look about 5 to 10 years older than Geraldo.
[375:15.27]I'm the older Geraldo.
[375:16.33]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[375:25.93]We are going to do... I'm going to do Red Alert.
[375:31.04]It should be fun.
[375:32.16]I'm ready to go nuts on this game.
[375:40.01]I'm gonna do, like, custom scenarios and shit.
[375:44.00]I'll have a backup just in case it's a disaster, but I think it should be fine.
[375:52.86]Thanks for watching.
[375:54.10]See you tomorrow.
[375:56.66]Are you sticking around?
[375:58.68]List of the bits.
[375:59.94]And the subs.
[376:02.30]What game?
[376:02.86]Red Alert.
[376:03.58]Command & Conquer Red Alert.
[376:06.31]I'm gonna see if I can get it to run.
[376:14.03]Nancy Drew.
[376:14.79]We need a Nancy Drew cooldown.
[376:18.06]We can't just go hard on Nancy Drew.
[376:22.34]I'm gonna do the original Red Alert, the first one.
[376:27.07]Hey, Sauce Bird!
[376:28.05]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[376:32.51]Uh, hey Jerma, hope you're doing well.
[376:34.26]This happened a while ago, but I specifically remember someone cheering to tell you that your Larry David impression sucks.
[376:40.16]Well, he sucks.
[376:41.54]I think it's great.
[376:42.78]Could you do Larry David giving a final battle speech?
[376:45.91]I'd love to hear it if you're able to.
[376:47.37]Have a great rest of your night.
[377:00.91]uh no tomorrow I'll open with it tomorrow it's I can't do it I can't do it I know I can't listen to my throat listen to my voice and there's no way I can do it what would you have no no there's no way I know I can't I can't do it I have to do it tomorrow
[377:32.54]I'll do it tomorrow.
[377:33.10]I'll do it tomorrow.
[377:34.76]Here's the thing you guys need to know about impressions that I do on the stream sometimes.
[377:40.62]They just come out.
[377:43.00]I don't know how to do them.
[377:44.90]I don't... I don't know how to do impressions.
[377:46.68]I don't... They just... They snap in and then that's it.
[377:50.06]I can never do... I don't know how to do them.
[377:52.90]I was doing...
[377:55.50]I was doing No Country for Old Men a week or two ago.
[377:59.04]It was pretty fucking good.
[378:01.14]I can't do that again.
[378:01.88]I don't even know where it came from.
[378:05.99]I have no idea where it came from.
[378:07.83]I can't, I could not do that for you right now.
[378:17.94]It's called Possession.
[378:23.49]It's called you have a split personality.
[378:25.35]What?
[378:25.61]And one of my personalities can do impressions?
[378:32.29]You're a vessel.
[378:33.85]It's called you're fucked.
[378:42.41]One of your personalities is Larry David.
[378:47.24]Eh.
[378:48.70]Okay.
[378:50.20]Okay.
[378:52.14]Eh.
[378:53.51]Oh, you know, I... Pretty.
[379:01.81]I can do it.
[379:02.79]No, I can't.
[379:03.61]Only the person that takes over and does impressions can do it.
[379:06.39]And they're not here right now.
[379:12.09]Dude, Ronnie.
[379:12.80]Dude, Ronnie.
[379:13.56]I got no respect.
[379:17.72]That was me pretending to be the person that takes over.
[379:26.49]Thank you, Saucebird.
[379:27.13]Appreciate that.
[379:33.01]That guy's shift ended.
[379:35.49]That guy's shift ends two and a half hours into the stream.
[379:41.33]Is this the guy who streamed poker to zero viewers?
[379:44.05]Yep.
[379:47.99]That dude just sits here in the back of my head for the first two or three hours and is like...
[379:53.48]Let's go.
[379:53.82]What am I gonna do?
[379:55.22]What character am I doing today?
[379:57.30]And two or three hours goes by.
[379:58.61]He gets bored.
[379:59.69]And he leaves.
[380:00.21]And he doesn't come back till tomorrow.
[380:15.88]You can stay, but I'm leaving?
[380:19.60]He takes 20 of your brain cells with him.
[380:23.02]Probably.
[380:25.50]Hey Michael, thanks for the 500 bits.
[380:26.50]Hey Jeremy, it's been a while since I've caught you streaming and had the money to donate.
[380:29.80]But I wanted to mention that your rant about ghosts and family members watching us from the afterlife was almost a straight up rip of George Carlin's material.
[380:39.33]I loved it and I think it's further proof that you're one of the greatest entertainers of our time.
[380:43.77]You're great, man.
[380:44.49]Thanks for everything.
[380:56.66]There's Mitchell, not Michael.
[380:57.90]Thank you, Mitchell.
[381:05.79]Possessed by George Carlin.
[381:08.45]He's a joke thief.
[381:14.73]Oh.
[381:18.47]He's ripping him off.
[381:19.87]Oh, damn it.
[381:22.54]You know, I think about that sometimes.
[381:23.74]And I'm like, oh, I have this idea.
[381:25.88]I want to do this and I want to try this.
[381:27.96]Has anyone done this yet?
[381:30.22]And then you're like, I Google search some of these things that I do.
[381:34.88]Has anyone done that yet?
[381:36.62]And then you're like, no.
[381:38.89]This person said something like that.
[381:42.59]But you guys understand how in like a thousand more years, it's going to be really difficult.
[381:49.53]Imagine like,
[381:51.20]Imagine somebody trying to make the shpee joke in like 100 years, 200 years.
[381:55.13]And they're like playing Team Fortress.
[381:56.35]Oh, this old game from like 250 years ago.
[381:58.29]Wow, this is great.
[381:59.25]Look at this character.
[382:00.93]Oh, what's it?
[382:01.49]The spy?
[382:02.19]Oh, it's a shpee.
[382:04.01]I play as the shpee.
[382:10.19]Why am I even referencing that?
[382:11.52]That's like my greatest achievement.
[382:16.36]Music too.
[382:17.16]In like a thousand years, every song will have ever been made.
[382:22.57]We'll get to the end of all notes in every order.
[382:27.58]There's going to have to be a new form of music.
[382:29.46]Someone's going to make a new instrument.
[382:30.64]People are going to have to start, like, playing their, like, playing their, like, skin.
[382:36.00]I don't know, like, grabbing their skin and, like, flicking it or something.
[382:44.29]There's no new instrument.
[382:59.65]clapping that's true alright let me get back on track anyways there's gonna have to be some new instruments or new sound waves in a thousand years they've gonna been every movie has been made they need to go to bed I'm not even I'm not tired
[383:30.30]I am not tired.
[383:34.50]I think it's time for the Caiden to have some sleep.
[383:46.46]Where are we?
[383:47.00]Anyways.
[383:48.64]Thank you, Mitchell, for the 500 bits.
[383:50.24]Appreciate that.
[383:51.00]Thank you.
[383:52.49]Heathcliff, the Friday Thriller.
[383:54.57]Thanks for the 250 bits.
[383:55.81]Hi, Jeff.
[383:56.35]Do you mind if I call you Jeff anyway?
[383:57.57]Can you do the Neelix voice, please?
[384:00.28]I can't.
[384:12.73]I can do it pretty good though.
[384:14.09]When he's here, when he shows up and he gets in there, I think it's pretty good.
[384:23.12]And you are actually talking to Jeff, which must be the person that's in there.
[384:30.17]Congrats on 3k viewers.
[384:31.43]I was here when you had zero.
[384:32.55]How the times change.
[384:33.63]I know, that's true.
[384:35.85]I went from zero viewers to like 5,000 in one day.
[384:45.72]I want to make sure I hit these subs because I don't think... No, we got Turkey, Tama, Zoro, Carlos.
[384:50.34]Thanks for the five each.
[384:52.26]Jeff gave five.
[384:53.18]I want to make sure... Was I like... I must have been preoccupied in my brain.
[384:56.56]Porcupine gave five subs as well.
[384:59.04]We had that raid from RT Game Crowd.
[385:04.23]Which, thank you so much, RT.
[385:06.33]Appreciate anybody that stuck around that you're still here.
[385:09.85]Thanks for watching.
[385:11.83]And thanks, RT, for that.
[385:15.69]RT is a swell dude.
[385:18.59]I've had the pleasure of spending some time with him in real life.
[385:24.81]Really, really nice person.
[385:26.64]Good dude.
[385:28.86]Stand for approval.
[385:32.38]Ah, Bobboy!
[385:33.38]Of course, who could forget Bobboy's five community subs?
[385:38.36]Thank you, Bobboy, right now.
[385:43.04]You hung out with a Minecraft YouTuber?
[385:47.36]Everybody is a Minecraft YouTuber.
[385:51.19]Here's your homework for tomorrow.
[385:53.15]Find me somebody that made YouTube videos from 2012 to 2016 that doesn't have a Minecraft video.
[386:04.08]There's your homework.
[386:13.95]Everyone's saying Star.
[386:15.19]That's not true.
[386:16.37]Sorry.
[386:17.69]Incorrect.
[386:18.15]He had a whole series on his second channel.
[386:22.85]Of like 10, 15 videos.
[386:24.97]So, sorry.
[386:34.11]Even I have a Minecraft video.
[386:36.11]Three, actually.
[386:37.09]Yeah, everybody has a Minecraft video.
[386:44.20]Yeah, he made, yeah, everybody has a Minecraft video.
[386:47.46]It was like the biggest thing in the world.
[386:50.46]It was the biggest thing in the world.
[386:52.18]It was like Fortnite times two.
[386:53.96]Almost, like what, five, six, seven years ago?
[386:56.76]It was times two Fortnite.
[386:58.76]They had a convention.
[387:01.96]There's no Fortnite con.
[387:03.97]There's a Minecon.
[387:05.15]And it was more popular than like PAX was.
[387:09.81]So everybody played it.
[387:12.98]no Fortnite con yet but no there's not gonna be a Fortnite con I will eat a whole shoe on camera if there's a Fortnite con just kidding just kidding just kidding just kidding just kidding just kidding see now the clip is ruined it's not gonna be a Fortnite con
[387:48.57]It might be.
[387:49.77]No, it's not going to be that popular in like five years, ten years.
[387:54.27]It's a very popular game right now, but it doesn't have the Minecraft staying power.
[387:58.06]No, no way.
[388:07.06]No, no way.
[388:10.04]But, let's keep moving.
[388:12.94]Acceptable causalities.
[388:15.96]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[388:19.03]When's the Christmas stream?
[388:20.13]There is going to be no Christmas stream this year.
[388:26.41]Sorry.
[388:28.03]There was going to be one, but the Minecraft Fuck the King server has replaced it.
[388:33.16]Because all the time, effort, resources, and energy it's going towards to make this work.
[388:39.46]So, the Minecraft stuff is going to be replacing any holiday-themed Christmas-type thing.
[388:54.18]Christmas is cancelled.
[388:58.74]I'm actually crying.
[389:01.35]It's alright.
[389:01.91]Don't worry.
[389:04.81]But thank you for the 500 bits.
[389:05.77]Thank you, Red Lemonade, for the 1500 bits and the 10 community subs.
[389:11.71]Thank you, Red Lemonade.
[389:12.94]They say nothing.
[389:14.92]Just 1500 bits and 10 subs.
[389:19.42]Appreciate that.
[389:19.98]It's very generous.
[389:25.46]Much love to you.
[389:25.98]Thank you.
[389:30.47]Vilemi gave 5,000 bits earlier.
[389:33.85]Thank you for the $50, Vilemi.
[389:35.91]And they say, my favorite part of DermaStreams is the in-depth discussion of marginal tax brackets and government revenue streams.
[389:59.95]Are you the king?
[390:01.55]Eh, that's me.
[390:04.80]But thank you so much for the 5,000 bits.
[390:06.82]It's a lot of money.
[390:08.96]So many of you give so much money to this stream.
[390:11.04]Thank you.
[390:13.74]Appreciate it.
[390:17.26]Uh, Sikilos, thanks for the 300 bits.
[390:19.78]They say, let's go, Jeremy.
[390:21.67]By the way, Jeremy is Germo.
[390:23.27]I can use his first name because we are tight like that.
[390:25.83]Yeah, I know top streamers.
[390:27.33]It's not a big deal to me.
[390:28.53]Laugh out loud.
[390:32.53]This is, like, top 10 favorite, like, bit message, I think, of the year for me.
[390:40.78]I love this.
[390:41.62]I don't know why.
[390:42.06]It's just perfect.
[390:44.14]It's LET'S GO Jeremy in all caps and then in parentheses.
[390:49.46]By the way, Jeremy is Jerma.
[390:50.66]I can use his first name because we're tight like that.
[390:52.65]Yeah, I know top streamers.
[390:53.75]It's not a big deal to me.
[390:54.73]Laugh out loud.
[390:56.29]It's perfect.
[391:01.79]Oh, it's a coffee pasta.
[391:03.33]It already is a coffee pasta.
[391:05.97]It's a pasta.
[391:06.83]Don't worry, Dermot.
[391:07.47]You're not special.
[391:10.56]Hey, it's easy.
[391:12.14]I was just like, mean.
[391:17.24]Hey, Swivel, thanks for the $1,050.
[391:24.97]Thanks for the $10, Swivel.
[391:27.69]They just say, Dermahart, you germs.
[391:30.98]All of us.
[391:32.02]That's not just me.
[391:32.88]Thank you.
[391:35.88]That's what I get for ruining Christmas.
[391:38.02]You can't ruin Christmas if you don't go.
[391:42.64]And you can't tell me that not going is ruining Christmas.
[391:45.68]No, you can't ruin something you're not going to attend.
[391:47.53]I have to be there to ruin it.
[391:55.73]I have declined your Christmas invitation.
[392:04.59]If you say, hey, you coming to my Christmas party?
[392:06.10]And I go, no, I'm not.
[392:07.52]Oh, you just ruined Christmas.
[392:09.10]No, I didn't.
[392:10.08]I can't go to your party.
[392:11.40]I can't go.
[392:16.93]How many other people are going?
[392:18.21]Like 50 to 60 people will be in my house.
[392:21.36]But you were supposed to be there on Christmas.
[392:28.68]And I'll send an e-card, okay?
[392:35.89]I have an idea.
[392:36.69]And it sucks.
[392:42.24]But like 10 people might think it's funny.
[392:46.47]Just do a stream that on Christmas Day is just like a 40 to 50 second video that repeats talking about how I'm not here today.
[392:58.15]And it's like a weird little ad like, Merry Christmas.
[393:00.70]I'll see you next week.
[393:01.70]I'm not here today.
[393:02.86]I'm enjoying my Christmas.
[393:06.96]Like, how desperate are you to continue to... Hey, guys, I'm iStream.
[393:17.17]Guys, I'm a streamer, right?
[393:18.87]Remember?
[393:22.65]I'll be back next week.
[393:23.45]I swear.
[393:23.67]I promise.
[393:27.53]Don't go anywhere.
[393:28.37]And if you want to subscribe, go for it.
[393:30.79]I'll check them later.
[393:32.13]After I open my presents.
[393:39.51]And I have a lot of them.
[393:42.89]Here.
[393:43.53]Take a look at this watch that I got.
[393:49.15]It just loops for a whole 24 hours.
[394:08.54]Run ads.
[394:11.28]I would stay to watch that.
[394:13.08]After you see it two or three times.
[394:14.56]Ugh.
[394:18.58]It would just... It would get so horrible.
[394:25.50]Or like, I'm not here right now.
[394:27.22]Here's a compilation of some of my funniest streams.
[394:30.82]And it's just like a 15, 20 minute compilation of like funny moments that happened.
[394:37.05]And then it just repeats it.
[394:41.11]And by the way, the funniest moments are boring dog shit.
[394:48.28]Like, for instance, just boring stuff that wasn't even interesting.
[394:55.80]Walking down halls and picking up keys and stuff.
[394:59.13]Or letting just dialogue play of a game.
[395:03.01]Like, for instance, when I was playing Outer Worlds.
[395:07.35]Have one of those sequences just be one of the characters speaking.
[395:12.27]That's it.
[395:12.67]And I'm not talking.
[395:16.57]Wow, what a fucking moment on stream, huh?
[395:26.00]There was a thing that I did last year that I kind of wish I did even more.
[395:30.78]Was the year in review when none of the clips even happened.
[395:36.68]I would love to do like a full 10 minute version of that, but it's so difficult to do that.
[395:43.63]Because I have to actually, what you guys don't understand is that those clips, I actually had to go into the Wolf Among Us and get to that part in the game.
[395:53.00]So it looked like this was really like halfway through the game.
[395:55.86]I didn't stream any of those things.
[396:05.77]I was sitting there in my chair after having like three, four, five of the games clipped and edited.
[396:12.29]And I'm just going, what the fuck else am I going to even play and get like an hour into so it looks real?
[396:27.76]Create an entire fake stream and reference it.
[396:32.09]Yeah, there's a lot of weird things to do.
[396:36.31]You played Wolf Among Us?
[396:39.15]I mean, I did.
[396:40.01]I played Wolf Among Us in like 2014.
[396:42.93]Not on video or anything.
[396:55.02]Or have like a... And let's take a look at some of those moments from last year.
[396:59.86]And it's all moments where I'm just mad at the chat and shit and just talking shit and being vicious and horrible.
[397:09.45]Like, I don't have any good moments.
[397:11.93]I'm just mean and terrible.
[397:20.30]Like, I'm not even... I'm awful.
[397:28.08]Like, telling people, like, shut the fuck up and stuff like that.
[397:30.28]You don't know shit, you dumb motherfucker.
[397:32.34]Yeah, that's right.
[397:34.40]Ban that guy.
[397:35.21]Ban him.
[397:35.51]I don't want to see him ever fucking again in my chat.
[397:38.37]Ever again.
[397:40.24]And it's just shit like that.
[397:41.18]Horrible.
[397:42.44]Like ten times in a row.
[397:47.89]And maybe there's one clip in the middle that's like weird and having fun.
[397:53.02]Alright.
[397:53.56]Good.
[397:53.95]Hey, thanks guys.
[397:55.75]Appreciate it.
[397:56.97]You guys, I love you guys.
[397:58.77]You guys are the best.
[398:00.91]You guys are so awesome.
[398:02.63]Let's get some hearts in the chat.
[398:04.33]It's right in the middle of me being just like screaming and yelling about how awful the games are and how like I hate chat and everything.
[398:17.81]Yeah, next clip.
[398:19.21]It's freaking offensive.
[398:24.95]It might be funny.
[398:29.11]Anyways, uh... Well, there's still time before December 31st.
[398:35.12]Because I still am doing the award show, which there's a lot going on.
[398:41.20]Hey!
[398:44.92]I gotta get that going, too.
[398:46.40]I gotta get that going, like, this week.
[398:52.47]But, uh, Swivel, that was Swivel for the 10 bucks.
[398:56.49]Thank you, Swivel.
[398:57.25]Zake, thanks for 250.
[398:58.27]Yo, just wanted to share with you my most important unwritten rule of life.
[399:01.81]There's nothing here.
[399:07.63]There's a quote, and that's it.
[399:12.76]Thanks for the 250, Zeke.
[399:14.84]And thanks for the rule.
[399:16.72]There are no rules.
[399:17.66]Is that what it is?
[399:19.48]SadVega, thanks for 300 bits.
[399:20.85]I'm riding this people crash to the end with you, good sir.
[399:24.75]Might I request Treasure Mountain as a DOS game sometimes?
[399:28.39]It was my favorite game when I was four.
[399:29.93]We played it.
[399:30.63]We played it.
[399:32.29]And it was very, very, very good.
[399:34.81]Probably the best game of the night.
[399:36.45]Besides Aladdin.
[399:40.32]I can't believe I streamed this for like six hours plus.
[399:45.15]That time just melted to me.
[399:46.61]It was like 45 minutes in my brain.
[399:50.19]I didn't even have to go to the bathroom.
[399:51.85]I haven't peed in seven hours.
[399:54.80]Oh, shit.
[399:55.22]I probably should do that.
[399:58.66]Yeah, New York, thanks for the five community subs.
[400:01.74]This was a few hours ago, but thank you.
[400:05.15]Hey DarkSoul, thanks for the 250.
[400:06.52]I fucking told you we were all fake.
[400:08.98]Do you believe that?
[400:09.70]You're in a coma now.
[400:10.72]Zero views, small time streamer.
[400:13.18]Here's some bits to grow up big and strong.
[400:15.36]Like a 10 plus views streamer.
[400:20.91]That was crazy.
[400:26.41]You know, it's normal when...
[400:29.94]Views, view fluctuations happen all the time and like I don't really care.
[400:34.94]But I will be honest with you.
[400:37.34]It was a moment when we were playing that werewolf game and dropped like a thousand viewers and it's just like, oh whatever.
[400:47.65]That's fine.
[400:48.95]That's alright.
[400:50.53]But once it went like another thousand and it was going slow too.
[400:55.12]It was not just like, oh, you're at zero viewers.
[400:57.34]There's a glitch.
[400:58.80]No, no, no, it slowly, slowly was ticking down to like 1600, and I'm sitting there going, this is, is this, people just leaving?
[401:07.30]Oh, this is, okay, maybe I should do something else.
[401:12.20]I was, I was, I was like, what's happening to me?
[401:22.04]Uh, but no, I, obviously, I don't, it doesn't really bother me.
[401:29.35]But you guys stayed, though, right?
[401:31.71]Hey, for real, though, thanks for the 250.
[401:34.55]Glad to hear you're going to be playing Red Alert tomorrow.
[401:36.99]I just wish Command & Conquer had a happier ending.
[401:39.79]Red Alert 3 was serviceable, but every game after that sucked.
[401:43.60]It's also terrible that EA cancelled Tiberium in Generals 2.
[401:47.18]That's it, I'm sick and tired of EA's bullshit.
[401:53.81]Uh, what is this?
[401:54.59]There's only one thing left to do.
[401:57.77]This Tim Curry is escaping to the one place that hasn't been corrupted by capitalism.
[402:05.47]What?
[402:10.45]I'm escaping to the one place that hasn't been corrupted by capitalism.
[402:18.59]Space.
[402:24.72]Ty, I'm, uh, Ty, what was it?
[402:26.54]What was the third one?
[402:29.23]What was the third Command and Conqueror?
[402:32.89]Tiberian Sun.
[402:35.21]People didn't like that one because it was too futuristic and it was a little weird.
[402:37.89]I liked Tiberian Sun.
[402:40.43]I'm one of the weirdos that actually liked that game.
[402:50.96]Command and Conqueror.
[402:51.76]Oh, it was great.
[402:56.26]I can't wait for the FMV cutscenes.
[402:58.06]That's the best part.
[403:02.44]anyways let's keep going banjo boy thanks for the 300 bits hey Jerma I'm very glad that you chose to stream on my birthday happy birthday and that my name is actually and my name is the actual name and the rat's birthday song so your name is Michael
[403:19.97]What the fuck?
[403:22.17]Also, I finished my master's degree yesterday, and you're smart.
[403:25.23]And aside from my own family, you're probably the most consistent thing during the whole process.
[403:29.08]Thanks for being an overall great guy.
[403:30.40]P.S.
[403:30.76]I want to play drums in the video game soundtrack I'm composing.
[403:34.02]That would be very embarrassing for me.
[403:40.87]How about this?
[404:06.06]Sample that.
[404:16.97]Rip VOD.
[404:17.85]Sorry, rip VOD.
[404:20.61]Hawkeye of mine, thanks for the 10 bucks, thousand bits.
[404:23.19]You forgot to turn VSync on, I think.
[404:25.36]L-U-L.
[404:27.80]Probably.
[404:29.34]There's no VSync in DOS games.
[404:31.22]The technology didn't exist.
[404:35.12]Thanks for the thousand bits though, Hawkeye.
[404:36.34]Seriously.
[404:36.66]Yeah.
[404:37.94]I could see that.
[404:38.40]That game was really good.
[404:38.94]I would play that.
[404:39.34]I would actually play that if I was younger.
[404:40.54]It was fantastic.
[405:04.35]Goo Berry Juice, thanks for the 500 bits.
[405:06.05]Can you tell me that I look rather tasty?
[405:11.59]Just play the part of the song.
[405:13.21]Just don't play it on stream.
[405:14.92]You'll get sued.
[405:18.90]Thank you for the 500 bits.
[405:20.22]Hey, Eugene, thanks for the 250.
[405:21.84]Glad to see you back, Jerma.
[405:22.76]I hope you feel better in the future.
[405:24.40]This is finals week for most of us here, so can you please bless us with a beatbox rap to wish us luck on our finals?
[405:38.37]Good luck on your finals.
[405:40.84]Have a good final.
[405:42.04]Oh, yeah.
[405:45.18]There's a beatbox guy that lives up here and he left like four hours ago.
[405:49.92]I just have to pretend to be this person.
[405:53.76]I got like four other people that live up here.
[405:55.63]I told you this already.
[405:56.31]I got the beatbox guy.
[405:57.11]I got the impressions guy.
[405:58.81]I got the comedian.
[406:00.87]I've got the guy that's got really strong arms.
[406:08.15]Not me.
[406:08.69]I'm just like the shell.
[406:09.93]I'm just the vessel.
[406:14.46]None of them are here.
[406:15.38]No, unfortunately.
[406:16.86]Well, maybe the strong arm guy.
[406:18.52]Let's see.
[406:21.02]I can lift my desk.
[406:23.76]Maybe not.
[406:26.28]Sucks that the comedian never seems to want to come out.
[406:55.12]I mean, I was going to think of a joke, but I can't.
[406:57.64]I fucking can't do it.
[407:00.09]I can't do it without him.
[407:09.08]But thank you, Eugene.
[407:11.48]Have a great final.
[407:31.22]I play originals.
[407:32.62]Play original hardware.
[407:34.28]Everybody got really mad at me because I was on original hardware and I went off.
[407:39.06]Just get the emulator.
[407:39.74]Why don't you just use an emulator?
[407:41.47]I use original hardware!
[408:03.85]Original hardware, DOS emulator?
[408:06.51]No, no, no, you must not have been here.
[408:11.72]Hey, thank you, Sukomimus.
[408:15.72]Thanks for the $2.50.
[408:16.24]Hey, Jerma, you should play Jurassic Park the game, but let the chat make the choices.
[408:20.28]What's your favorite dinosaur?
[408:23.13]My favorite dinosaur is...
[408:29.76]Not a Triceratops.
[408:30.62]Too many toys.
[408:33.48]Stegosaurus and Triceratops are just too many toys.
[408:37.29]Not T-Rex.
[408:42.69]Honestly, probably... What's the one that's in the water?
[408:51.04]That has the weird fin arms and has a really long brontosaurus neck?
[408:57.74]What's that called?
[409:00.92]The Allosaurus.
[409:04.13]It's one that looks like the Loch Ness Monster.
[409:09.21]Placeo... Placeosaur?
[409:11.53]Is that the one?
[409:12.00]Let me see.
[409:12.76]Play... Placeosaur.
[409:18.10]Yeah, that's the one.
[409:19.40]The Placeosaur.
[409:20.14]Those things are insane.
[409:29.51]wrong choice sorry what the jurassic park the game is that the telltale one didn't they make one telltale made a bunch of random games before they got popular don't they have a back to the future game too
[409:52.13]They have a couple of strange games.
[409:54.53]I don't know.
[409:54.97]I'll take a look at it.
[409:55.59]I haven't really given it any thought.
[409:58.15]Hey, Buttsquire, thanks for the 500 bits.
[410:00.01]Boneworks Waiting Room, Resident Sleeper.
[410:03.19]I can't play VR until I get over this issue.
[410:11.24]My mobility is pretty low right now.
[410:15.68]I'm doing these new stretches and these new...
[410:21.09]Like, I'm doing shit for my back and chest and every day.
[410:26.72]And the more that I do it, it's just, I'm just insanely sore and shit.
[410:32.10]I want to.
[410:32.62]But it's the reason why I had to cancel the greens.
[410:35.96]And that's not the wrong word.
[410:37.09]I had to move the green screen to at some point in like probably a few weeks.
[410:43.75]Because I need to be able to be moving around.
[410:46.13]I don't want to go in front of the green screen and be like,
[410:51.70]Uh, oil!
[410:53.78]Oil!
[410:54.48]I mean, write that down.
[410:55.48]That's actually not a bad one.
[410:56.58]That's like a Wizard of Oz bit.
[410:57.66]Put that down.
[410:58.52]I will do that, but I actually feel that way.
[411:03.29]So... Uh... I just can't move around that much.
[411:13.89]Preemptive -2.
[411:15.41]What?
[411:15.79]It's the Wizard of Oz!
[411:19.68]Let's get the credits on screen.
[411:20.75]These are all the subs.
[411:21.53]Thank you, subs.
[411:23.63]All of you.
[411:26.77]What a name that was.
[411:32.74]That was just like 20 digits.
[411:39.64]Hope you feel better.
[411:40.40]Yeah, there's... It's a lot.
[411:44.76]It's a weird mystery thing.
[411:48.14]And we have some ideas.
[411:51.50]And... Some of them are strange.
[411:57.06]I have a hiatal hernia.
[411:59.06]That's one problem.
[412:00.59]But I think there are like two or three problems connected together.
[412:04.23]That make this one giant annoying super illness.
[412:13.13]So... Hiatal hernia.
[412:16.35]Costochondritis.
[412:19.06]That's what they think it is now.
[412:21.60]I don't know.
[412:24.22]How did that happen?
[412:25.87]I don't, it kind of just does.
[412:28.13]My father had costochondritis.
[412:31.41]I actually talked to him on the phone and I'm like, yeah, the doctor thinks I have costochondritis.
[412:35.81]She's like, oh yeah, I had that for like 10 years.
[412:37.58]I'm like, what?
[412:40.10]What happened?
[412:40.58]What do you, what do you mean?
[412:41.36]What, what, what, what, what?
[412:44.04]He's like, yeah, yeah.
[412:46.34]Yeah, I went away.
[412:47.72]I got some, you can get like injections for it.
[412:50.34]I don't know.
[412:57.50]But he told me, yeah, it took about 10 years to go away.
[413:00.23]Okay, that sounds great.
[413:02.19]I can't wait for that.
[413:03.79]Can't wait to be 50 when my rib cage doesn't hurt.
[413:08.31]That's great, dad.
[413:09.87]Thanks, dad.
[413:22.47]Thanks, Dad.
[413:23.37]But we'll see.
[413:26.89]You gotta do what you gotta do.
[413:28.43]You gotta do what you do, and you just do it.
[413:30.81]And that's it.
[413:32.41]Put that in your yearbook.
[413:38.00]But, we have a few more bits to do.
[413:43.66]I'm Benjamin Button?
[413:53.12]That's not correct.
[413:55.56]Benjamin Button goes the other way.
[413:58.41]Getting healthier and younger as you age.
[414:00.31]Yeah, that's not true.
[414:01.27]I'm just getting old.
[414:08.43]Reverse Benjamin Button is you just age.
[414:18.67]That's normal.
[414:24.47]Yeah, that's just a normal human.
[414:26.41]What are you guys talking about?
[414:30.71]Alright, let's keep going.
[414:33.23]Actually, there's only, like, two more.
[414:36.84]Uh, Nintenzoid, thanks for the 500 bits.
[414:38.78]Hey, Jerma, I want to buy you Christmas socks.
[414:41.24]I just need to know what your feet size is.
[414:45.42]Why did you word it like that?
[414:46.70]Why don't you say shoe size?
[414:48.58]That's feet size?
[414:51.18]Shoe size, that's how we say it.
[415:04.10]What is my shoe size?
[415:05.32]14.
[415:05.34]It sucks when I... Centimeters.
[415:17.36]No.
[415:17.88]Size 14.
[415:22.88]When I open up doors, sometimes my feet are so long that I'll actually hit my toes when I open the doors.
[415:30.70]Yeah, like Goofy.
[415:39.16]Alright, what do you think it is?
[415:40.64]I'll tell you if you get it.
[415:41.88]No, you guys will get it.
[415:42.80]Somebody will get it in the chat.
[415:43.73]Just, what do you think?
[415:49.09]Okay, yeah, somebody got it.
[415:49.97]Cool.
[415:51.37]There you go.
[415:51.65]It's in the chat somewhere.
[415:52.45]Somebody wrote it in the chat.
[415:58.24]But thank you, Buttsquire, for the 500 bits.
[416:00.26]I actually, I can't wait to play Boneworks.
[416:02.12]It looks like it's going to be awesome.
[416:04.52]And Nintenzoid for the 500 bits.
[416:06.96]Somebody wrote it in the chat.
[416:08.40]I'm sure you'll find it.
[416:10.97]Hey, Ice Cut Digital, thanks to the 250.
[416:13.19]Gonna get real with you, Jerma.
[416:14.87]Album of the decade, game of the decade, movie of the decade.
[416:19.48]I cannot answer this question because this is like two plus hours of deliberation.
[416:33.07]I can't, I can't do that.
[416:34.91]That has, that's its own strength.
[416:38.82]Like that's the title of a stream that's IRL.
[416:45.66]I couldn't even come close at the moment.
[416:51.10]Yeah, that's a calm stream topic for sure.
[416:55.86]There's still 20 days left to figure it out.
[417:01.07]Yeah.
[417:07.30]You can't even name one video game.
[417:17.85]But, I would hold on to that one.
[417:20.69]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the five community subs.
[417:22.47]And Bobboy, both of you have five community subs.
[417:26.42]Thank you.
[417:29.68]Sub drop after sub drop.
[417:32.54]Keith, King, Crimson, thanks for the 250.
[417:34.02]What if the Sultan stream Minecraft server is you as Santa and we're all your elves?
[417:39.13]Nah, it's got to be a king.
[417:40.63]Because it takes place in like a medieval town with a castle and everything, so... It's got to be a king.
[417:53.92]See you tomorrow for Red Alert.
[417:59.94]Santa was a king.
[418:02.75]Not really.
[418:05.29]I mean, I guess it is like the North Pole.
[418:06.59]Santa doesn't sit on a throne.
[418:11.97]Lovely Carver, thanks for the 250.
[418:13.09]Do you remember, if there is no custom I am the King choreographed song and dance number for the King stream, I will beat you up.
[418:21.45]You've been warned.
[418:22.07]Okay.
[418:24.11]How am I supposed to choreograph that?
[418:33.09]There are things that we're working on, though, that are not what you think.
[418:37.31]It's gonna be fun.
[418:38.75]I can promise you that... Look, hold on.
[418:41.03]Will it work?
[418:41.85]I don't know.
[418:43.05]Will it be fun?
[418:45.89]I don't know.
[418:48.13]Will you remember it?
[418:50.93]Probably.
[418:52.38]I will.
[418:54.24]I can at least promise you a memory.
[418:57.62]That's pretty much all I can promise.
[419:07.03]Hey, oh, Elden Ring.
[419:09.75]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[419:11.53]Well, you beat Elden Ring on stream when it comes out.
[419:14.16]Very, very interesting name and comment.
[419:19.14]Thanks for the $10 in bits.
[419:20.44]Thanks for a thousand bits, first of all.
[419:22.55]And yes, I play every FromSoftware game on this stream.
[419:28.88]The only one I didn't play on this stream and beat to its completion was Dark Souls 2.
[419:34.17]Because I had... and Bloodborne.
[419:36.65]And it's because I'd already played and beaten those games more than once.
[419:43.73]Bloodborne specifically like 6, 7+, 8 times.
[419:46.82]He played Armored Core.
[419:54.30]Kingsfield.
[419:57.28]Okay.
[419:58.64]Sure.
[419:59.70]What was the one that I just played?
[420:01.70]What was it called?
[420:07.14]Metal Wolf Chaos.
[420:08.20]Right.
[420:08.49]Yeah.
[420:08.73]I played that.
[420:09.25]That's a FromSoftware game.
[420:13.15]Okay.
[420:13.43]Let me put it this way.
[420:14.85]All of FromSoftware's third-person Souls-like games we play on this stream.
[420:22.94]So yes, I'm going to play Elden Ring.
[420:25.06]I'm sure I will complete the whole thing on this stream.
[420:30.54]Unless it sucks.
[420:36.36]And I'll see you tomorrow.
[420:44.70]Not if I do it first.
[420:48.04]That's the best part about playing brand new FromSoftware games.
[420:51.22]It was like that with Sekiro.
[420:53.82]Nobody knows what's going on.
[420:56.94]So if you play like the first day or two that it's out, for the most part, people don't know where everything is and don't know how to do everything.
[421:03.68]It's great.
[421:07.47]So I can't pick like the wrong weapon and have everybody scream at me because I'm using the wrong katana.
[421:12.81]What are we doing tomorrow?
[421:21.12]We're gonna play Red Alert.
[421:23.39]And if that doesn't work, that's okay.
[421:25.35]I have a couple of backups.
[421:26.73]And then the next day, we're doing the Game Awards.
[421:28.83]And then after that, you're not gonna see me until the Minecraft stream.
[421:32.75]But before that happens... Before that happens, I'm gonna make sure I give a very long-winded explanation of what's going to happen on that stream.
[421:46.15]So, as of the Game Awards stream in two days,
[421:51.25]either before or after the Game Awards, we're gonna hang out for like an hour or so, and I'm just gonna go over and explain how everything's gonna happen.
[422:01.33]I'm assuming by then I will have everything locked down and know everything that's gonna happen.
[422:14.73]See you tomorrow.
[422:16.37]We'll talk again.
[422:18.29]Have a great night, guys.
[422:18.99]See you tomorrow.
[422:20.21]Goodbye.
