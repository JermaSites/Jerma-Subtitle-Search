[00:03.41]What's going on?
[00:07.63]Why am I always late?
[00:09.37]Because I'm not ready.
[00:15.59]That's it.
[00:18.93]That's it.
[00:19.51]That's it.
[00:19.97]That's the only explanation.
[00:21.17]That's it.
[00:23.97]Why are you not ready?
[00:25.62]I'm just not.
[00:27.66]I'll sit down at like 3.50.
[00:30.06]Make sure like OBS and everything's working well.
[00:31.98]And make sure I'm capturing the right things.
[00:34.93]I don't have a drink or anything.
[00:37.71]I can't just like turn the stream on without a drink.
[00:39.17]I need my tea.
[00:42.39]And then I take a sip out of the tea.
[00:43.69]And I realize that like wow that's really moving me a little.
[00:48.67]I have to go to the bathroom.
[00:49.93]I have to pee.
[00:51.25]I gotta comb my hair.
[00:54.77]Does my phone ring?
[00:57.91]Is it mom calling?
[01:05.49]I don't know.
[01:06.03]I can't take mom's phone call on stream.
[01:09.41]So it's like I have to have a decision here.
[01:11.59]It's either, okay, I see mom's calling at like 3.55.
[01:13.87]Okay, if I don't answer this mom phone call, I can't talk to mom until like 10, 11, 12 o'clock tonight.
[01:22.94]I gotta talk to mom.
[01:23.80]I gotta answer mom's call.
[01:24.66]I gotta answer mom's call.
[01:25.72]Of course I am.
[01:29.25]I mean, Mom didn't call today.
[01:30.23]What's going on?
[01:34.73]How are you?
[01:36.23]Good to see you again.
[01:36.81]We're going to pick up where we left off last night.
[01:42.72]Where's my... Okay.
[01:44.32]Precisely, where's my chapstick?
[01:47.54]I'll be right back.
[01:48.32]See?
[01:48.50]This is what I'm talking about.
[03:07.98]Okay, I got it.
[03:09.72]He fell in the toilet.
[03:10.50]I actually did today.
[03:13.98]Funny.
[03:14.88]That was like a plant from chat because I was going to talk about that for a second.
[03:18.48]It wasn't a big deal.
[03:22.08]I didn't fall in the toilet, but I sat down on the toilet rib cage.
[03:31.31]Not the seat.
[03:32.37]The seat was up.
[03:33.69]And I sat down on that rigid part.
[03:41.18]I was in a hurry.
[03:45.41]I almost wish I had the audio from this whole thing.
[03:50.01]Because I made this old man sound.
[03:54.21]He was like, hey!
[03:55.06]He was like, hey!
[03:57.52]Hey!
[04:00.62]Because when I sat down, you're never expecting that.
[04:05.86]we as humans know the exact distance from ass to seat and even one to two millimeters off your body goes into a panic mode once you're not at that spot where you know it's supposed to be all hell breaks loose and it's holy I'm going I'm I'm sinking through the Earth then it hurts it hurt
[04:44.28]I mean, I don't know why.
[04:45.04]I'm not just like ground pounding down on the toilet, but it kind of hurts.
[05:00.37]Your ass distance must be crazy.
[05:02.31]No, it's not.
[05:03.47]You guys know what I mean.
[05:05.46]You hit that moment where your ass is not on seat.
[05:09.50]And you know it's supposed to be.
[05:11.21]And even if it's not even a tenth of an inch, you know it.
[05:13.87]And you're already sitting down, so you're screwed.
[05:22.41]So we're gonna play some demos, we're gonna do what we did last night.
[05:24.77]Looks like the internet seems to be okay right now.
[05:28.69]I'm glad that whatever route Twitch was... Twitch was taking to my internet, I'm glad is fine.
[05:35.52]It ended up being fine last night too, so let's cross our fingers here.
[05:46.85]Maintenance, yeah.
[05:48.76]Your mic sounds goofy.
[05:51.58]It doesn't.
[05:57.04]My mic does not sound goofy.
[06:01.31]You got a goofy-ass mic.
[06:04.69]This is my voice you're talking about.
[06:08.57]Now you got me all freaked out.
[06:09.69]Oh yeah, we're going to start with Gloomwood.
[06:14.29]I'm very excited for this game.
[06:16.75]This is by, uh... I think... The Dusk Dev had something to do with this.
[06:21.90]That company, what's it called?
[06:22.96]New Blood?
[06:26.16]Very excited for this.
[06:28.26]They usually come out with very, very good products.
[06:32.63]And... Could we see a coveted 5v... Not 5v5.
[06:37.43]Could we see the coveted 5 out of 5?
[06:39.99]We only gave one last night.
[06:43.77]I got high hopes.
[06:50.59]What was the second highest score I gave last night?
[06:54.39]Please clear your throat.
[06:56.85]Oh no, it says please don't clear your throat.
[06:58.79]Well, dude, my voice is fucked up.
[07:06.68]It was a four.
[07:07.08]What did I give, um...
[07:13.02]What did I give that other game?
[07:15.57]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[07:16.19]Let's do it.
[07:21.75]You should be able to hear it.
[07:22.63]Let's move over here.
[07:25.93]That's even going to work.
[07:27.05]I hope so.
[07:27.67]Hi.
[07:33.85]Here's Gloomwood.
[07:35.35]And here's me, too.
[07:37.08]I'm here.
[07:41.19]You gave 9 souls a 4-6.
[07:43.61]What did I give that rhythm game?
[07:45.08]That fighting kind of rhythm game.
[07:46.78]What did I give that?
[07:49.38]Was it like a 4?
[07:49.96]4-something?
[07:54.74]I didn't give that a 3-6.
[07:55.55]I gave it a 3-9.
[07:58.07]That wasn't fair.
[08:02.03]That's like a 4-1.
[08:04.09]That wasn't fair.
[08:09.07]Can you hear this?
[08:10.17]I was like coughing.
[08:12.21]Alright, Gloomwood.
[08:12.95]I'm ready.
[08:15.05]Here we go.
[08:17.31]This is a demo.
[08:18.10]For those of you who don't know, Steam is currently running this big event where a ton of upcoming games that are not out yet have demos that you can play right now.
[08:27.56]It's a big Steam event.
[08:29.44]So this game is not out and it's not coming out for a while.
[08:33.11]We get exclusive access to it as a Steam community.
[08:41.51]Let's go.
[08:43.96]Select difficulty.
[08:44.60]Let's do... I'm just doing half moon.
[08:48.84]I'm not doing any of this other stuff.
[08:51.75]Okay, brightness.
[08:56.33]Just go full bright.
[09:01.20]I can see both the moons.
[09:02.98]Wait, what does it want me to do?
[09:04.51]Until the left image is not visible.
[09:06.95]I always don't listen to this, though.
[09:09.01]Because I know that... Okay, when the moon's not visible, that's... Oh, wow, it's really dark.
[09:14.29]I always go at least a little bit more.
[09:16.97]I just... I can't.
[09:17.73]I can't see anything.
[09:18.35]You're going to break the immersion.
[09:25.07]Yeah, but I want to be able to see...
[09:27.59]I think that's okay.
[09:28.75]Just a little bit.
[09:29.71]Okay, let's go.
[09:31.39]For a second, I thought that was way too much.
[09:32.88]It was like I did way too much.
[09:40.76]Put the screen shake up.
[09:41.76]See what I'm saying?
[09:43.92]This is why I did it.
[09:47.23]How's the audio?
[09:47.67]Can you hear it well?
[09:48.21]Is the audio good?
[10:01.27]There he is!
[10:02.75]There he is!
[10:03.17]W, A, S, D, yep.
[10:10.44]Turn off the lights.
[10:11.34]It's the middle of the afternoon where I am.
[10:13.44]It's not going to do anything.
[10:23.77]Tap F to pick up items.
[10:24.99]Hold F to manipulate items.
[10:27.98]Apologies that I could not encounter you in person.
[10:30.60]For now, take this vial and find your way into the manor on the main street.
[10:33.76]I await your arrival.
[10:36.14]Okay.
[10:36.82]In the manor on main street.
[10:39.64]Use tab to open your inventory and health status.
[10:42.56]Oh, okay.
[10:45.14]It's kind of like a VR setup.
[10:46.28]Okay, so I got a letter.
[10:50.66]I've got a vitalizing tonic.
[10:53.72]I don't want to inject that right now.
[11:01.37]Tap F to open the door.
[11:02.35]Hold F to slowly open the door.
[11:10.87]Your visibility is affected by light and shadow.
[11:14.14]Ah, lower right.
[11:23.66]Hold space to manta.
[11:30.85]Ooh.
[11:32.47]Creepy.
[11:34.01]Be cautious of traversing on loud surfaces.
[11:36.85]Hold left shift to sneak.
[11:38.11]Okay, I need to go in the manor.
[11:57.62]An enemy?
[12:01.70]Ooh, what's this?
[12:06.53]Cool.
[12:09.43]Oh, it goes across.
[12:10.67]It hits multiple times.
[12:15.61]Oh, that's cool.
[12:16.31]Alright, let's go.
[12:17.71]Cane sword.
[12:18.33]Jailhouse.
[12:18.74]This is not the manor, but whatever.
[12:20.46]Door's locked.
[12:20.98]Oh, I have a sword now.
[12:28.03]Can I sneak anywhere?
[12:28.77]Can I break something?
[12:29.47]Can I break this?
[12:30.61]I can.
[12:30.93]How do you crouch?
[12:40.40]Cheese.
[12:51.35]What is this?
[12:53.37]Money?
[12:59.23]Dead end.
[13:03.01]Sewer cheese, yeah.
[13:04.23]Dead end.
[13:07.07]Bullets?
[13:13.30]Dead end!
[13:25.53]Why do you have a shiny nose today?
[13:36.96]I don't know, my father was fucking Rudolph.
[13:40.30]Get over it.
[13:54.45]Now that was funny.
[13:55.71]Alright, so I need a key to get in there?
[13:59.41]Wait, weapons can be drawn and holstered.
[14:01.29]Oh, okay.
[14:05.56]This way.
[14:07.36]Some objects can be destroyed.
[14:14.75]Boy, why would it say that if... Oh.
[14:26.96]Save your progress.
[14:28.56]Okay.
[14:29.34]Saved.
[14:31.66]That's quick and painless.
[14:33.30]I like it.
[14:45.23]So there's guns in this game?
[14:46.07]That's where I need a gun.
[14:47.72]There's guns and there's also sprockets.
[14:53.18]Did I get him?
[15:06.91]Oh shit, okay.
[15:07.61]I have to dump this guy somewhere, don't I?
[15:14.98]What?
[15:17.82]I didn't want to do... Right mouse block incoming melee attacks.
[15:25.18]Where is he?
[15:42.80]Oh, there's the key to the jailhouse.
[15:44.20]Gun.
[15:58.33]Alright.
[16:15.16]You just shot that guy.
[16:16.10]Yeah!
[16:16.82]I did!
[16:17.12]Alright, I got the key.
[16:28.68]You did a nice stealth.
[16:30.88]I stealthily shot that guy when he came down the stairs.
[16:33.24]Can you- How do you throw stuff?
[16:41.83]There's gotta be a way, right?
[16:44.24]Yep.
[16:44.76]Okay.
[16:45.08]Give me one of these.
[16:46.32]Give me the box.
[16:54.68]Ah!
[17:02.33]Anything else in here?
[17:10.24]Okay, so I have the key.
[17:11.22]That goes to the jailhouse, right?
[17:22.17]Does somebody say, why are you acting like you're playing Minecraft?
[17:27.91]I'm not.
[17:34.70]Oh, God.
[17:35.56]Oh, my God.
[17:43.87]Now, save the bullets.
[17:44.61]Just hide.
[17:51.24]Did this guy- did he see me?
[17:52.02]I don't think he saw me, right?
[17:53.74]Nope.
[17:59.86]Don't step on the grate.
[18:01.75]Oh my god, he shot me in the head!
[18:19.77]Okay.
[18:28.34]There's something in my nose.
[18:29.02]It appears that something needs to be placed into this.
[18:39.69]Dude, I have... I got these, right?
[18:46.61]Oh, no.
[18:47.13]That's the wrong... Whatever.
[18:53.06]Alright, guardhouse.
[18:57.41]This door's locked?
[18:58.27]Shit.
[19:00.33]I need to be pulled through fences and... Oh.
[19:03.96]Okay, nice.
[19:09.02]I hear fucking smoke.
[19:15.85]Ah!
[19:17.57]What?
[19:18.01]Oh my god, it was...
[19:37.47]We're good.
[19:40.17]Dork mic.
[19:41.01]I'm sorry.
[19:41.51]My mic is a fucking dork.
[19:42.91]I'm sorry.
[19:43.49]I'll turn it down.
[19:47.13]Stealth game.
[19:47.95]Yeah, I know.
[19:48.93]I'm not very good at stealth games.
[20:01.26]I didn't know the window was right there.
[20:21.02]Cool.
[20:21.18]What does that do?
[20:23.49]The seal has been placed in the jailhouse evidence locker.
[20:25.75]Okay, jailhouse evidence locker.
[20:44.62]Okay, so I got jailhouse.
[20:48.06]Got it.
[20:48.75]I got my task.
[20:49.65]I know what I need to do.
[20:54.15]Lean against doors to hear behind them.
[20:56.89]Really?
[20:59.71]Oh, wait.
[21:00.03]Somebody was in the bathroom and they're just not here anymore.
[21:06.64]Because when I shot the gun downstairs, they...
[21:20.94]Okay, so we need to go to the jailhouse.
[21:24.22]Do I need a key for the jailhouse?
[21:35.88]Whatever.
[21:42.55]Guardhouse.
[21:45.03]Alright, I need the two seals.
[21:54.53]Remember to return to the phonograph to save.
[21:56.47]The city of Gloomwood only gets more dangerous from here.
[21:59.13]Oh, no.
[21:59.57]I don't remember where the phonograph is.
[22:05.06]Where's the phonograph?
[22:17.99]This game goes hard.
[22:19.15]It's in here, right?
[22:26.49]I missed a shotgun?
[22:36.65]Did I actually miss a shotgun?
[22:45.54]I did.
[22:45.90]I thought you were lying.
[22:46.78]Okay.
[22:57.24]So now I gotta go... I don't know, where's the save thing?
[23:12.56]Ah!
[23:13.46]Way too dank, I'm sorry.
[23:14.36]I put a limiter on the mic too, and it doesn't fix it.
[23:29.67]We'll do some tests on it in a minute.
[23:37.78]Where'd that guy go?
[23:38.96]Oh, fuck.
[23:44.14]If I lean out, can they see me?
[23:45.86]Can that guy see me when I do that?
[24:07.28]Fuck.
[24:17.80]What?
[24:18.14]I did a backstab.
[24:19.77]Did I just do a backstab?
[24:21.25]I thought I just backstabbed him.
[24:25.65]Oh, it has to blink.
[24:26.69]Okay, it has to blink.
[24:32.12]I get it.
[24:34.79]Nice face stab.
[24:35.59]That was a back stab.
[24:36.69]It just didn't register.
[24:44.12]What can you do with the money?
[24:49.86]Wait, hold on.
[24:50.98]Did the dev say this demo is so old and crusty?
[24:53.72]Did the dev say the demo is old and crusty?
[25:00.31]What?
[25:02.67]Wait, the dev came in here and said, oh god, this demo is so old and crusty.
[25:08.19]I think it's good.
[25:10.09]It's an old build compared to what they're working on now.
[25:20.95]I don't think it's crusty.
[25:22.13]What do you mean crusty?
[25:23.01]Alright, here's a power station.
[25:27.96]Can I do a force pull on it?
[25:38.85]Alright, power station.
[25:44.24]Jerma, you're old and crusty too.
[25:45.86]Yeah, so it's fine.
[25:47.88]Alright, relax.
[25:58.41]Hey guys.
[26:04.05]If that was in the game, wouldn't it be better?
[26:10.35]What?
[26:25.67]Where is this person?
[26:38.25]I'm trying to distract him.
[26:58.01]That's just gross.
[27:03.32]Okay, I don't even... Why do I even sneak?
[27:06.62]Why would I even be sneaking?
[27:07.61]I'm just crouching around shooting people with a shotgun.
[27:10.05]Why wouldn't I just shoot them?
[27:11.93]Just shoot them.
[27:20.27]Is this a gun?
[27:20.63]This is the third broken rifle this week.
[27:27.02]It's a stealth game.
[27:28.82]I'm not good at stealth games.
[27:35.33]Some of you guys want to make like a big blueprint before you get in the level and be like, this is where I'm going to go and that X right there, that's where I'm going to stay for five minutes.
[27:42.52]I'm going to go cook pasta and come back.
[27:44.44]And then when the guy makes his rounds, I'm going to go sneak behind him, do one tap on his head and then this exit.
[27:49.04]No, my brain's too small to do that.
[27:52.01]I can't do that.
[27:55.55]The shotgun ammo is very rare.
[28:01.88]Some of you guys are very meticulous, and you want to plan out your routes, and that's fun.
[28:06.82]And you can do that.
[28:07.70]You can do that in your game.
[28:08.96]But I want to throw a bottle at somebody's face point blank.
[28:12.49]Oh, shit.
[28:16.37]And hey, guess what?
[28:17.59]Do we both get to the end of the level?
[28:22.51]See, me walking around going like this.
[28:27.07]And you, like, sneaking around, and like... We both get to the end of the level, and we both get a passing grade.
[28:38.91]I don't want to hear it.
[28:48.31]Ooh, okay, that's one.
[28:50.49]Another gun?
[28:52.43]Is this dual welding?
[29:01.32]2.6 GPA.
[29:02.24]Yeah.
[29:08.50]Okay, so I got that.
[29:10.90]There's the key.
[29:11.62]What key is that for?
[29:12.50]What does it say?
[29:15.28]Warden court key for the door near the jailhouse.
[29:20.13]Shotgun.
[29:21.25]I got a lot of ammo.
[29:22.53]Cheese.
[29:22.95]Oh, eat this.
[29:26.31]That's it?
[29:30.63]I just ate five wheels of cheese.
[29:33.21]Okay, so now the door into the jailhouse.
[29:46.18]I got one of the Resident Evil puzzle piece stones.
[30:05.63]So the dev is here, right?
[30:06.53]When are you going to add the golden breadcrumb trail that goes... I have GPS to where I need to go.
[30:14.62]I thought that was going to be in the game.
[30:16.06]I was kind of convinced it was... I don't know why it's not here.
[30:18.88]I don't really want to say I'm disappointed, but... I mean... Whatever.
[30:27.98]It's alright.
[30:28.92]I'm sure they'll add it later, I think.
[30:35.44]That just scared the shit out of me.
[30:36.48]I thought I was going to get zapped by Darth Sidious.
[30:39.96]I thought a guy was sitting there just waiting for me with hands... I don't know.
[30:42.91]I just made it up.
[30:46.11]Okay, let's put this in.
[30:46.91]I need one... Alright, jailhouse.
[30:48.69]Let's back this way.
[30:57.76]It's kind of near the beginning, isn't it?
[31:01.68]Are you going to save the game yet?
[31:05.19]I mean, you might need save points.
[31:08.41]I'm a hardcore gamer, though.
[31:10.61]And we didn't have save points.
[31:13.98]When you got to level 5 in the Lion King on Super Nintendo, and when you lost, you had to do the whole game over again.
[31:22.81]That's what I was used to.
[31:33.92]Wait, should I?
[31:34.46]Wait, this is different.
[31:35.40]Okay, I'm going to get this right.
[31:44.17]This is completely inaccurate.
[31:45.51]I'm not good at this.
[31:47.65]You know what I am good at?
[31:48.47]I would walk around the corner and be like, Excuse me, sir.
[31:50.60]How are you?
[31:52.44]My name.
[31:52.76]Could I please shake your hand?
[31:53.62]I would shake his hand.
[31:54.50]We'd talk.
[31:56.18]Like, I'm the guy that distracts the guards.
[31:58.04]I'm not the guy that sneaks into the fucking... into the castle.
[32:01.20]I'm the one that walks up and does like a goofy routine and distracts the guards.
[32:05.46]While I do like magic tricks for them and they laugh and clap and stuff.
[32:08.50]And then the main character gets to go into the castle.
[32:11.84]And then guess what?
[32:12.34]I get to go home.
[32:13.28]I get to go home after that.
[32:20.26]I did my job.
[32:33.80]Okay, they didn't see that, good.
[32:41.82]Oh god.
[32:54.25]It looked cool!
[32:55.73]It looked cool!
[33:06.42]He's a jester.
[33:09.42]What do you guys think I... Okay, back in old medieval times, what do you think I would be?
[33:13.28]I don't know.
[33:15.50]Everybody has this thing in their mind.
[33:16.84]No, I'd be the sword-wielding hero.
[33:19.22]No.
[33:19.54]No, I wouldn't.
[33:21.80]I would be dancing around the dinner table.
[33:26.50]You'd be dead?
[33:27.40]No, I wouldn't.
[33:32.81]I'm not gonna be the guy with, you know, the rapier.
[33:35.63]Like... Oh, please, no.
[33:52.82]Did you have a Red Bull today?
[33:55.38]I don't drink Red Bull.
[33:57.24]I'm just a fucking weirdo.
[33:59.54]I think.
[34:00.30]I don't know.
[34:03.00]No, I'm not even a weirdo.
[34:04.78]You're the weird ones, not me.
[34:11.77]You're the town fool.
[34:15.19]Is my head too... Can you see me?
[34:22.43]Copium.
[34:23.19]I'm just kidding around.
[34:27.44]But yeah, I would not be the... No, I'm not gonna be the hero.
[34:35.32]Don't turn around, don't turn around, don't turn around.
[35:11.35]Alright, nice.
[35:14.36]Cistern entry.
[35:21.72]You want to relive the Lion King?
[35:23.03]He walked by the save room like three times.
[35:30.53]Nobody wants to relive the Lion King.
[35:33.50]No one.
[35:40.80]That was so off.
[35:41.68]I was trying to arc that so badly that it was going to hit him in the head, and it was completely off.
[35:47.26]Somebody's coming.
[35:47.77]Somebody's coming.
[35:48.19]Somebody's coming.
[35:49.97]Somebody's coming.
[35:50.55]Somebody's coming in the room right now.
[36:03.47]The Lion King is not good.
[36:12.25]Where is this guy?
[36:14.47]Did he not come up here?
[36:17.88]The Lion King, the movie is fine.
[36:19.86]The video game was just hell on Earth.
[36:38.07]What did you guys think I was talking about?
[36:42.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[36:43.89]Did you guys think I was talking about trying to watch through the Lion King movie?
[36:51.65]And there's no save points?
[36:57.04]Well, I'm gonna go make... Wait, what?
[36:59.16]What are you talking about?
[37:01.78]I'm talking about the Lion King, the video game for the SNES.
[37:05.14]That's what I... Wait, why?
[37:06.02]I think you guys are getting confused.
[37:20.43]I said game like three times.
[37:21.67]Yeah.
[37:21.91]Ooh, lantern.
[37:24.45]Oh, goodness.
[37:26.06]Does this cost, um, oil?
[37:28.78]It probably does.
[37:36.43]Fully visible to enemies.
[37:41.89]Aww.
[37:51.25]Does that mean I'm invisible to enemies in the dark?
[37:55.09]That's kind of what that means, right?
[37:57.43]I'm fully visible.
[37:59.17]But not right now.
[38:00.19]Is there a bottle?
[38:01.06]Give me this.
[38:07.70]I think a bug just flew in my eye.
[38:09.84]And it probably was on camera.
[38:14.73]How do I get him to open the door?
[38:22.84]There's a little entrance over there in the wall.
[38:30.77]Should I pull him?
[38:34.49]If I aggro him, will he come out somehow?
[38:39.87]Alright, come out then.
[38:42.27]Get out here.
[38:44.01]Come and get me then.
[38:45.15]Come open the door and come get me.
[38:47.78]Alright, where's he going?
[38:59.90]Can I turn this off?
[39:01.04]I dunno Huh?
[39:31.51]Oh, God.
[39:31.97]Are these... Oh, these are freshly fired.
[39:35.98]Alright, give me the shotgun.
[39:47.34]What the fuck is that sound that I just heard?
[39:50.30]What the fuck was that sound?
[39:52.30]What the hell was that sound?
[39:55.08]That was horrifying.
[39:56.24]Holy sh... Oh, I hate this.
[40:11.19]Was it in front of me?
[40:12.29]Was it... Was it in front of... Was it right in front of me?
[40:15.17]And there was no light?
[40:20.20]I think... I literally think I was looking at it.
[40:21.48]I think I was looking at it and it was dark.
[40:29.48]Oh, goodness.
[40:35.85]Is it me?
[40:38.11]That wasn't me.
[40:39.27]That wasn't me.
[40:40.11]That was not me.
[41:03.40]I got it.
[41:10.16]Storage.
[41:11.62]Door control.
[41:15.15]What?
[41:15.41]What the hell was that?
[41:21.97]What?
[41:22.67]There's a weird thing over there.
[41:42.01]Okay, okay, okay, yep.
[41:44.27]There's the thing there.
[41:45.03]It's like a fucking bird!
[42:02.00]Can I kill this in one hit with a backstab?
[42:03.98]I need a dev confirmation.
[42:06.94]I need a dev confirmation.
[42:13.42]Oh shit.
[42:18.81]Will it see me right here?
[42:23.63]It won't see me right here, right?
[42:24.97]Will it see me right?
[42:25.59]I need to dev post on Twitter right now.
[42:27.75]Will it see me in this dark?
[42:28.67]Dev post on Twitter.
[42:29.39]Will it see me?
[42:52.66]Where the fuck am I?
[42:54.28]Okay, right here.
[42:54.78]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[42:55.46]Storage.
[43:00.98]It's not coming over here, right?
[43:04.22]What the hell was that over there?
[43:05.22]There were eyes over there.
[43:06.31]Relax.
[43:07.15]No, that's not eyes.
[43:09.17]No, no, no, no.
[43:10.01]Get out of here.
[43:10.71]Get the fuck out of here.
[43:13.87]There's one in the room right now.
[43:21.09]Is there...
[43:43.85]2010 YouTuber reaction.
[43:47.21]Dev said, yeah, backstab it.
[43:48.33]It works.
[43:48.63]2010, man.
[43:55.29]I'm traveling back in time.
[44:00.26]Is there two?
[44:01.36]I think there are two.
[44:05.42]I think there are two.
[44:09.66]This sucks.
[44:37.07]I'm sorry.
[44:37.65]It's fucking 2010.
[44:49.40]I'm sorry Okay
[45:01.06]That wasn't that bad.
[45:01.90]Okay, they die in like one hit.
[45:03.12]They die in one hit.
[45:04.50]Two hits.
[45:06.06]Your mic sucks, dude.
[45:08.05]I'm fixing it right now.
[45:09.33]I'm pausing it.
[45:10.11]I'm fixing it right now.
[45:11.87]Look, here we go.
[45:12.81]I'm fixing it.
[45:13.59]You ready?
[45:14.17]My mic sucks.
[45:15.19]Hold on, give me a second.
[45:15.93]I swear to God, this is gonna take two minutes.
[45:19.17]Okay, here we go.
[45:19.63]Ready?
[45:23.47]Here we go.
[45:25.62]You tell me when it's better.
[45:29.60]Oh!
[45:30.04]Oh my god, bro!
[45:31.42]Oh my god!
[45:32.32]Is that better?
[45:34.19]Oh my god, bro!
[45:35.27]Whoa!
[45:35.99]What the fuck is happening?
[45:37.71]Better?
[45:38.99]Is that better?
[45:46.31]Dude, what the fu- Hey!
[45:47.59]Hey!
[45:47.91]Hey!
[45:48.17]Hey!
[45:48.43]Hey!
[45:53.98]Second one's worse?
[45:58.50]First one better.
[46:01.00]So this one right here.
[46:01.66]This is pretty good.
[46:03.38]Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[46:04.80]Easy, easy, man.
[46:05.62]Easy.
[46:05.96]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[46:07.66]Better?
[46:16.38]It's crunchy.
[46:17.92]I don't think I can make it.
[46:19.59]I'm yelling into a microphone.
[46:23.25]Nice fucking eye exam, dude.
[46:30.14]Stop screaming.
[46:30.90]I can't help it.
[46:32.14]I'm an overreacting YouTube Andy, okay?
[46:37.41]That's not going to change.
[46:40.49]Alright, let's go.
[46:41.21]I think that's in a better spot than it was last time.
[46:42.63]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go, go, go, go, go.
[46:45.93]That's better.
[46:46.72]We're good.
[46:47.04]We're fine.
[46:47.36]Everything's fine.
[46:58.58]This one's worse?
[46:59.28]How is this one worse?
[46:59.98]Dude, you need to get a blue Yeti.
[47:09.08]I remember those were all the rage back in 2010.
[47:12.38]A blue Yeti.
[47:15.40]No, a blue Snowball was the big one, right?
[47:18.65]Dude, every single person had a blue Snowball.
[47:21.29]If you could buy stock in the blue Snowball company back in like 2008, and just sell it in 2012, you probably would have made a fucking shitload of money.
[47:32.45]If that was actually, if they were actually publicly traded.
[47:36.33]I swear to God, I think every human being that was in front of a computer in 2010 had a snowball.
[47:42.56]And let's be honest, they worked great.
[47:46.52]They were cheap, they weren't that expensive, and they just plugged it in and it was ready.
[47:53.41]Alright, did I complete my task here?
[47:59.67]The blue snowball is still kind of good.
[48:02.85]But every single fucking person had one.
[48:06.93]Oh, dude, when they came out with the blue Yeti.
[48:09.23]Pro.
[48:11.09]Oh, yeah.
[48:12.59]Hey.
[48:14.19]I'm gonna get that one.
[48:15.27]I wanna sound like a pro.
[48:19.91]Yeah, I've used the snowball before.
[48:22.06]It works great.
[48:30.46]Alright, am I doing this right?
[48:32.84]Well, I can read.
[48:33.38]Let me read.
[48:39.10]Oh wait, I already saw this one.
[48:41.36]So what is this thing?
[48:42.18]It's like a crank?
[48:54.81]What does this go?
[48:58.68]Is there a crank?
[49:01.84]Excuse me?
[49:08.85]Do you guys remember the movie Crank?
[49:12.51]If the guy's heartbeat, if his heart rate went down to a certain beats per minute, his heart exploded.
[49:23.02]What a fucking hilarious movie.
[49:26.36]Alright, should I put it on here?
[49:31.09]Okay, main canal.
[49:33.62]Yeah, the movie, if you guys didn't know the movie Crank.
[49:37.84]It's a movie about a guy who gets some type of drug or something injected into him.
[49:41.76]Or he has like a fake heart or something.
[49:43.44]They give him a fake heart that's like an electric heart.
[49:46.62]I don't even know what the plot of the movie is.
[49:48.72]All I know is it's like the movie Speed.
[49:51.56]Where, you know in the movie Speed you have to go a certain miles per hour on the bus.
[49:56.22]This guy had to keep his heart rate up.
[49:58.09]If it went underneath, his heart would explode.
[50:00.81]And they made a sequel.
[50:02.75]Yeah.
[50:03.81]Insane.
[50:07.89]Okay, where is it?
[50:12.33]Can I use it?
[50:13.07]How do I use it?
[50:23.64]No, it's not going to work.
[50:25.98]Does that not work?
[50:28.32]I need to put it right here, right?
[50:30.96]Press the use button.
[50:32.16]Oh my god.
[50:33.06]Okay, we're good.
[50:33.72]Main canal.
[50:34.62]Alright, let's go.
[50:42.30]Something in my eye.
[50:48.52]I'm loading my shotgun up just in case one of those bird things shows up.
[50:55.06]Main canal.
[50:56.64]Pump room.
[51:06.65]What the fuck?
[51:13.64]Oh god damn it, no.
[51:38.64]Just go back, back, back, back.
[51:48.96]I can do it.
[52:12.64]I don't know which side he's on!
[52:13.46]I don't know which side he's on!
[52:14.67]I don't know which side he's on!
[52:16.03]He's right in front of me!
[52:16.95]I don't know which side he's on!
[52:18.31]Nobody here.
[52:26.04]Which side is he?
[52:26.54]Ah!
[52:26.66]Bend!
[52:30.66]I gotta keep my fucking heart rate up, mate.
[52:32.50]I just keep punching people in the fucking face, man.
[52:36.23]Are you fucking trying to tell me that my heart rate goes down under 14,000 fucking beats per minute, mate?
[52:44.44]Oh god, I'm in trouble now.
[52:45.34]I have to run.
[52:46.76]How do I get out of here?
[52:51.93]Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot.
[52:54.54]Joke was more important than playing the game.
[52:56.34]Joke was up here playing game down here.
[52:59.24]Way more important, apparently.
[53:08.15]I'm not afraid now.
[53:08.91]Now, I'm not even afraid.
[53:15.25]Let's go.
[53:21.02]Now I'm annoyed.
[53:22.04]Let's go.
[53:27.62]I'm not afraid.
[53:39.96]Come on!
[53:44.97]Hey, stupid!
[53:45.63]Why don't you come up here?
[53:47.91]But only come one at a time, though.
[53:50.07]What?
[54:03.17]Where?
[54:03.63]What?
[54:08.15]Oh my god, he's behind me!
[54:14.77]Okay, fuck.
[54:18.51]I have to sneak.
[54:19.19]I can't attack him.
[54:19.97]I can't.
[54:20.25]I have to sneak around.
[54:22.49]I just have to sneak around.
[54:23.25]You can't attack them.
[54:24.57]Attacking is wrong.
[54:25.55]It needs to go.
[54:30.82]It's a stealth game.
[54:31.80]I know, but I can't do stealth games.
[54:38.78]There are two things in this world that I cannot do.
[54:42.11]Stealth adventure and a Tetris.
[54:53.29]For most math problems.
[55:00.81]Who even saw me?
[55:08.91]Thank God there's no bullets in this gun.
[55:10.25]I would have shot it and I would have... I gave my position away.
[55:18.56]Oh my God, what are they doing?
[55:44.69]They're sprinting around.
[55:46.81]What am I supposed to do?
[56:02.69]What?
[56:03.03]Where?
[56:03.55]Where are you?
[56:06.09]What the fuck?
[56:38.23]God damn it.
[56:43.99]Alright, turn it back down.
[56:45.03]I gotta get- I'm almost at the end of the demo, I imagine.
[56:49.91]I'm gonna turn it back down to where it was.
[56:51.85]Here.
[56:54.21]See?
[56:54.87]It's back down to where it was.
[57:01.23]That was fun.
[57:01.65]Was that loud too?
[57:02.87]Was that like crunchy and horrible?
[57:10.48]Yes.
[57:19.14]God damn it.
[57:19.86]This part's hard.
[57:27.29]I'm just gonna kill them.
[57:29.59]Fuck it.
[57:31.25]I'm doing it my way.
[57:35.11]And that's stand right here in the light.
[57:37.93]There's this three.
[57:39.91]This guy's dead right now.
[57:41.43]There's one.
[57:42.11]There's one.
[57:42.62]There's one.
[57:43.14]There's one.
[57:43.64]Here comes two.
[57:44.24]Where's two?
[57:45.14]Here it comes.
[57:46.20]Right there.
[57:47.56]Why is there only one shot in this gun?
[57:51.16]There's your second.
[57:52.50]Where's the third one?
[57:59.37]Let's go.
[58:00.53]There's the other piece.
[58:44.22]Hey, hey, boys and girls!
[58:45.20]That would be a fucked up start to Mickey Mouse's Clubhouse.
[58:57.89]What a weird intro.
[58:59.55]Is there like a monkey?
[59:07.68]Alright, I have to get out of here!
[59:11.43]Where's the exit?
[59:16.95]Okay, there's not gonna be another one spawning, right?
[59:21.44]I have- okay, I got bullets.
[59:25.28]Get out of here.
[59:29.08]Go, go, go, go, go, get out, out, out, out.
[59:46.80]I'm feeling to full health.
[59:48.26]It's just a demo, guys.
[59:49.26]I'm going to get to the end of the demo.
[59:50.28]Ooh, okay.
[60:00.94]This is like a shortcut.
[60:02.46]This looks wrong.
[60:03.24]Oh, it's because I was cheating.
[60:12.15]Okay.
[60:16.83]Okay, now that eye's gonna go to that door?
[60:18.15]I did it.
[60:20.87]Alright.
[60:21.55]That was fun.
[60:22.71]That was terrifying, but fun.
[60:28.31]There we go.
[60:29.09]Hell yeah.
[60:34.81]Is there more?
[60:41.99]Stanley?
[60:43.67]Stanley walked into the church.
[60:54.79]Very good.
[60:56.81]That was good.
[60:57.23]That was intense.
[60:59.74]That was Gloomwood.
[61:01.94]Explore the Early Access.
[61:03.62]August 16th.
[61:06.54]I marked that one on your calendar.
[61:07.74]Seems like it's going to be really good.
[61:08.68]I'm going to give that one a rating.
[61:13.78]No, that's higher than a 3.9.
[61:14.56]The demo for Gloomwood... ...was a 4.
[61:25.26]Point.
[61:32.58]Hold on.
[61:33.34]Don't influence me.
[61:35.33]Sound design.
[61:36.21]Five.
[61:38.85]Length of the demo.
[61:40.39]Five.
[61:42.47]Getting right to the point.
[61:44.29]Five.
[61:46.34]Just right to the point.
[61:46.98]Hey, this is what you're doing.
[61:48.02]Here's a little tasks.
[61:49.80]Just go play the demo.
[61:50.90]Five.
[61:55.90]Scare factor.
[61:56.48]5.
[61:57.60]4.
[61:59.16]6.
[62:01.32]Stealth game.
[62:01.84]3.
[62:02.75]This is a 4.7.
[62:16.10]This demo was a 4.7.
[62:23.80]No, I'm not... Hold on, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[62:25.46]I'm not saying that, like... This is me personally giving you a review.
[62:31.79]Does that mean stealth games are bad?
[62:33.61]No.
[62:34.31]That's just how I feel about stealth games.
[62:37.15]I'm not very good at them.
[62:38.28]I'm very bad at them, and I can't play them very well.
[62:40.44]So, for me, a stealth game, right off the bat, is like a 2.
[62:43.48]Okay?
[62:45.18]A stealth game is a 2 right out of the box.
[62:49.48]This one was really good.
[62:54.03]4.6.
[62:54.27]Let's go.
[62:57.79]That's a skill issue.
[62:59.39]Look, okay.
[63:02.05]That was phenomenal.
[63:05.05]Right out of the box, all stealth games get like a 1.5 for me.
[63:10.60]The game could be a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.
[63:15.86]That's a 4.6 out of 5.
[63:19.59]Yeah, that was phenomenal.
[63:22.47]Very, very well done.
[63:24.25]I loved it.
[63:25.67]But I'm terrible at stealth games, and I can never play this game the way it's intended for it to be played.
[63:32.03]But I can still enjoy it, I think.
[63:35.15]What about Metal Gear?
[63:36.75]I feel the same way, right?
[63:39.25]Do you guys have any idea how many times when I was playing Metal Gear I heard, There he is!
[63:45.49]And I would just go...
[63:50.29]No, that was fantastic.
[63:51.61]4.6 Gloomwood.
[63:52.91]Look, actually, I'm looking forward to playing it.
[63:57.60]Because that, I mean, you got a Mickey Mouse scream out of me.
[64:00.06]It was like horror and stealth, though.
[64:01.60]So that's, that was awesome.
[64:03.90]It wasn't just a stealth game.
[64:06.40]Don't categorize it as that.
[64:07.38]Okay.
[64:12.99]So now, I also, because we queued up another one for today as well.
[64:18.16]uh trepang that I remember I got that one last night I was gonna try it let's try that one tripping two okay let me get the game here difficulty normal video resolution that's a weird resolution that I don't have
[64:47.11]1440p.
[64:47.37]Come on, bro.
[64:51.99]90 FOV.
[64:53.71]No motion blur, please.
[64:55.43]Oh, you can't see.
[64:55.99]Sorry.
[65:06.19]Okay.
[65:07.25]Field of view 90.
[65:09.27]Gamma.
[65:11.38]I think that looks alright.
[65:12.18]Wait, is this a scary game too?
[65:13.60]Quality preset high.
[65:14.58]Audio.
[65:14.94]Alright, this is important.
[65:16.10]How loud is it?
[65:16.78]I can't really tell.
[65:17.94]Is it good?
[65:24.11]Is it maybe a little lower?
[65:24.85]A little bit higher?
[65:28.51]I can't see over here.
[65:31.45]Maybe like a little bit lower?
[65:34.84]We'll take it down to like 70.
[65:36.78]How's that?
[65:40.16]It's doing normal.
[65:47.93]Did that just... What's going on?
[66:07.58]That was very far.
[66:08.72]I was like, wait, when are we going to stop and it's going to be us standing there?
[66:13.19]Wait, Trey Pang 2 was made by Trey Pa- There was a Trey Pang 1, and it was made by Trey Pang Studios.
[66:19.79]Okay.
[66:20.71]Alright.
[66:21.54]Let's go.
[66:28.78]So this is a sequel.
[66:38.65]Come on, guys.
[67:00.31]Did he just shoot me in the face?
[67:10.32]Am I alright?
[67:21.02]Oh, no, he missed.
[67:22.73]He missed.
[67:24.69]He missed.
[67:26.73]Oh, he missed.
[67:27.23]Alright.
[67:31.69]I can't see fucking anything.
[67:32.93]Hold on.
[67:42.37]It's so dark.
[67:45.68]Can anybody see anything?
[67:46.64]A little lower.
[67:53.64]This DPI on this mouse is seriously... How would you ever have it this high?
[68:01.04]Somebody correct me.
[68:04.18]Is this weird to me?
[68:06.86]I've never played a video game where this was ever higher than here.
[68:10.77]Out of a hundred?
[68:15.15]How could you ever have a hundred?
[68:17.83]Is my mouse just fucked up?
[68:19.51]Is my mouse just weird?
[68:23.11]I'm gonna say four.
[68:28.01]it feels better alright so then now turn the gamma up a little is that cheating what about just like 10 I think that's okay right it has to be an even number of freak out okay like security is not responding we're willing to investigate
[69:03.97]The fuck?
[69:09.74]What is going on?
[69:14.12]What was that?
[69:15.82]What happened?
[69:37.52]I thought something was running down the hall.
[69:40.12]Okay, something is running down the hall.
[69:45.68]Is this a stealth game?
[69:46.56]It is.
[70:09.94]Still too high.
[70:14.82]And I'm going 120.
[70:15.88]We're going 20%.
[70:16.52]And I need to turn this down to like 2.
[70:23.20]You know, I've been concerned playing games before where I didn't think, even down at 1, it felt really bad.
[70:30.02]And I was like, what am I supposed to do about this?
[70:32.22]I have to go into the DPI settings, right?
[70:36.41]3 should be fine.
[70:39.36]Three's fine.
[70:43.39]Yeah, that's better.
[70:43.87]That feels good.
[70:44.65]Feels natural.
[70:47.95]This game looks really nice.
[70:50.07]Hide in the dark.
[70:52.79]Is there a run?
[70:53.79]I just pressed E. What happened?
[70:57.53]Oops.
[71:02.11]Hey, fellas!
[71:04.05]Let me distract you for a second.
[71:05.60]Would it work here?
[71:09.45]You see, I... My car broke down on the road.
[71:14.48]Can you believe it?
[71:15.16]Right a mile down the road.
[71:16.32]I had to walk a mile.
[71:17.20]It would probably just kill me.
[71:23.24]That would be like a target sighted!
[71:32.09]What is this, some kind of currency thing?
[71:35.41]Do I have a flashlight?
[71:44.53]What?
[71:54.22]Who?
[71:55.08]Yo, I think I see him.
[71:57.74]What's with the dings?
[71:58.96]What's going on?
[71:59.88]What?
[72:00.80]Clown mode?
[72:01.60]What's clown mode?
[72:02.28]Get out of here.
[72:07.99]How do I run?
[72:09.40]What is sprint?
[72:10.94]They're throwing grenades and how do I run?
[72:14.10]How do you run?
[72:14.84]Somebody tell me how you run.
[72:15.94]How do I run?
[72:16.60]How do I run?
[72:17.10]How do I run?
[72:18.57]How do I run?
[72:19.17]How do I run?
[72:35.29]There's nobody in the wall, man.
[72:39.09]That guy's pretending to work.
[72:45.82]What the fuck?
[72:50.10]Clown mode.
[72:53.21]I'm stuck in here.
[72:54.17]How do I get out of here?
[72:56.81]Is there a jump?
[73:05.85]He's throwing flares in here.
[73:07.33]How do I get out of here?
[73:08.69]Oh wait, I see.
[73:17.40]You can't get me up if I save area here.
[73:22.90]Who would win?
[73:23.54]A hundred guys with machine guns or a walking clown?
[73:40.15]How do I run?
[73:43.60]I like this game.
[73:45.42]I think this game's got serious potential.
[73:48.32]And I mean it.
[73:49.28]Dead serious potential.
[74:01.07]Oh my god, there's a gun.
[74:10.87]Is there aim down sights?
[74:21.18]Nope.
[74:21.58]It's like... Okay.
[74:22.42]Alright.
[74:22.72]It's kind of like Counter-Strike mode.
[74:23.86]Oh my god.
[74:26.88]Oh, what the fuck?
[74:29.42]Okay.
[74:37.43]Let's go.
[74:40.62]Should I go across?
[74:41.60]Wait, what's in here?
[74:42.16]Might be ammo.
[74:43.30]Is there a flashlight?
[74:47.50]No, can't get in there.
[74:49.28]There we go.
[74:49.76]There's the sprint.
[74:51.42]Jump and melee to do... Oh my god, there's a kick?
[74:53.38]Okay, potential.
[74:53.92]Left alt is slide?
[75:15.88]Oh my god.
[75:16.44]Okay, that's gonna be hard to do though.
[75:22.40]Flashlight.
[75:23.20]Thank you.
[75:23.60]I got full health.
[75:41.92]What'd you... I missed it?
[75:43.22]What'd I miss?
[75:51.63]What did I miss?
[75:55.46]Turn off the light.
[75:56.08]What did I miss?
[76:02.89]You missed it.
[76:03.83]I didn't miss anything.
[76:04.53]What did I miss?
[76:04.99]Go back up to where the body is?
[76:17.76]Where?
[76:18.94]I missed lore?
[76:20.06]Whatever.
[76:21.20]It's a demo, it's fine.
[76:30.37]Running is clean, by the way.
[76:32.45]If you're curious, running is very clean.
[76:51.84]What?
[76:52.00]Why is it so blue?
[76:52.96]I tried to shoot two times.
[77:34.29]What's that?
[77:34.59]What's that?
[77:34.91]What is this?
[77:36.83]What's this?
[77:45.58]What is that?
[77:57.54]We can't even hit each other.
[77:58.76]What a bunch of fucking idiots.
[78:07.04]The gun... this is great.
[78:09.30]This plays really well.
[78:31.14]Don't miss any lore, right?
[78:34.52]What's the game name?
[78:35.02]This is called Trepang 2.
[78:42.43]Is there actually a Trepang 1?
[78:44.97]This is actually really, really good.
[79:22.99]So he's playing angry foot.
[79:27.47]How does this feel?
[79:28.01]Is this like buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh bu
[79:52.05]Is this like an ammo crate or something?
[79:53.89]No?
[79:57.21]Oh yeah, I'll take it.
[79:59.43]I love shotguns, like my favorite in every game.
[80:06.14]Armor, yep.
[80:13.80]Slow down time?
[80:30.64]Oh my god.

[80:51.51]Yeah, so this is fear.
[80:56.76]Oh shit.
[80:59.04]Do they do it still?
[81:04.43]Oh shoot, come on.

[82:39.96]I haven't been here before.
[82:55.60]He's in a time paradox.
[83:05.12]coin.
[83:07.54]Holding the coin like this will get you killed.
[83:09.08]Can I have the sword?
[83:16.63]Can I have the sword?
[83:19.13]The sword looks pretty cool.
[83:21.89]I don't think so.
[83:45.52]What are they shooting at?
[83:48.82]There's nobody here.
[83:50.04]What?
[83:56.93]Don't move.
[83:58.33]Don't move.
[84:00.65]Don't you dare move.
[84:07.60]Hey!
[84:08.68]Don't... I see what you're trying to do, but it's not going to work.
[84:12.22]You're not going to get a good line on me, I tell you.
[84:16.11]Hey.
[84:18.19]Hey.
[84:19.33]Stop.
[84:19.65]Hey.

[85:29.60]Well, that does that.
[85:31.18]I'm alright.
[85:49.21]Person?
[85:58.04]The inside of my ear is itching.
[86:01.04]Does that mean that somebody, like, sneezed?
[86:03.38]What does that mean?
[86:04.08]That means something, right?
[86:12.78]What the hell was that?
[86:13.60]What was that little shimmy?
[86:23.83]No, it's if somebody sneezes, that means they're... No, if you sneeze, it means somebody's talking about you.
[86:28.67]That's what it is.
[86:40.70]What was that huge kick?
[86:42.56]What the fuck was that?
[86:44.88]What just happened to that guy?

[94:07.06]Laser and a suppressor?
[94:08.20]Holy shit.
[94:08.68]Yeah, cool.
[94:13.35]Can I customize this?
[94:14.13]Laser.
[94:19.25]Laser, yeah.
[94:24.18]The game is so loud.
[94:25.38]I thought you guys told me it was good.
[94:29.49]I thought you guys told me it was good.
[94:30.49]Has it been this loud the whole time?
[95:17.72]Whoa, what the hell was that?
[95:24.77]Whoa.
[95:25.49]Don't walk into that.
[95:30.64]Oh my god.
[95:31.56]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[95:32.62]What are you doing?
[95:33.10]Don't throw that.
[95:33.62]It's going to blow the whole thing up.
[95:35.26]Thanks, actually.
[95:46.54]Oh, shit!
[95:47.00]I have three bullets.
[96:07.72]This looks, um...

[96:35.75]They're gonna come from this way?
[96:42.70]Don't say move in.
[96:43.84]I know they're gonna go on the elevator.
[96:45.08]They're making this too easy.
[96:50.78]CR2 move in from the second elevator.
[96:53.33]CR3 move in from the third elevator.
[97:25.21]God that guy's probably He's trapped I'm trying to get him out
[97:56.93]I don't think he's alive.

[98:12.06]Where?
[98:12.88]Oh.

[100:11.43]Okay.
[100:42.19]That guy wasn't even close!
[100:51.89]This guy looks like a bug on character.
[100:55.02]What was that?
[100:55.68]What happened?
[101:10.94]Is he on me?
[101:13.18]Why is he attached to me?
[101:14.18]Get him off me!
[101:43.18]What the fuck, dude?
[101:44.62]What the hell?
[101:46.68]I didn't like that.
[101:48.38]I didn't like that.
[101:49.22]It was horrible.
[101:50.92]That was fucked.
[101:54.59]Are they stopping me?
[101:58.31]Wait, these are bad guys?
[101:59.97]What?
[102:05.58]What happened?
[102:06.60]What's going on?
[102:07.47]What's going on?
[102:08.99]Wait, I thought these were the enemies.
[102:10.85]These are friendlies?
[102:11.81]How?
[102:12.59]I've been... These guys are... What?
[102:20.10]We're gonna get you out of here, man.
[102:27.64]I was like, why are they not shooting at me?
[102:29.35]It was weird.
[102:34.29]I need to know.
[102:35.24]I need to know.
[102:36.92]I need to know.
[102:41.60]I have to know.
[102:42.60]Okay, I'm not leaving until I know.
[102:48.95]I can't.
[102:55.44]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[102:56.60]I didn't mean to do that.
[102:57.52]I really didn't.
[103:02.47]I've been shooting at these guys in this armor the whole time.
[103:05.62]I didn't know that I was being rescued.
[103:09.78]I just see guys pointing guns at me and I was like, oh, there he is.
[103:19.23]That was insane.
[103:20.83]Holy shit.
[103:21.65]That's a five.
[103:32.63]That's absolutely a five.
[103:38.31]Wow.
[103:44.11]When does this come out?
[103:53.81]There's more?
[103:57.10]It's not over.
[103:58.12]Really?
[103:58.40]Are you serious?
[104:04.93]What?
[104:06.85]It's coming out this year?
[104:07.67]Oh, hell yeah.
[104:08.29]Oh my god.
[104:09.68]Customized appearance?
[104:13.18]What's going on?
[104:13.66]Oh, it's me shooting.
[104:43.17]So what do I do here?
[104:48.23]Oh, you select missions.
[105:05.14]Kind of like a hub?
[105:11.76]That was just pure... That was just adrenaline.
[105:17.49]I'm starting to understand the kinds of games that I really like.
[105:20.43]And it's just like the go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[105:29.33]Do not kill... I'm not gonna... I know now that I'm not gonna shoot anybody.
[105:32.25]Don't worry.
[105:34.03]We have a mission ready for you.
[105:35.27]A raid on a Horizon facility.
[105:37.69]Similar to the one you escaped from.
[105:40.33]Intel?
[105:40.55]Okay.
[105:41.25]Well, there better be Intel in that computer.
[105:47.83]You know what I'm saying?
[105:50.07]Prologue and... Oh, okay.
[105:50.71]Complex.
[106:11.84]Hack in and download the encrypted data.
[106:16.99]Just normal.
[106:17.45]Normal is fun.
[106:23.29]Did I do it?
[106:23.95]Do I have to leave?
[106:26.96]Launch mission.
[106:31.02]Oh, I have to get on the helicopter.
[106:32.00]Okay.
[106:35.47]What is this?
[106:43.50]Serum, of course.
[106:52.99]That was a dual welding serum?
[106:55.69]That's kind of weird.
[107:22.09]Can you open the door for me?
[107:24.97]I'll get it.
[107:34.50]Customize, change your clothes.
[107:36.16]I don't care.
[107:37.00]I don't need to change clothes.
[107:39.00]I think I'm good.
[107:44.77]B.F. Bugleberry Serum.
[107:52.00]I didn't do that.
[107:52.74]Don't blame that on me.
[107:53.54]That was poor placement.
[107:57.02]Okay, so I have to sneak in here and hack the mainframe?
[108:03.33]Clean up?
[108:04.03]How much... Okay, clean up.

[108:31.64]Oh.
[108:37.66]What?

[108:42.01]Wait, this is a setup.
[108:43.09]They were waiting for me.
[108:45.29]They were waiting for me.
[108:45.97]This is a setup.
[109:29.93]Dual welding.
[109:33.11]So it's just, okay, it's like a wave.

[114:52.64]Oh my god, they're just collapsing here.
[115:04.79]Oh my ears
[115:33.54]I just want to see what the squad looks like, and then I'm out of here.
[115:56.32]Okay, 25 right now.
[115:56.80]Let's get the squad.
[115:59.58]Alright, squad time.
[116:02.22]What in the...

[116:09.60]Where's the supply thing?
[116:18.09]Where's the supply thing?
[116:19.11]People are throwing grenades.
[116:25.81]Alright, squad incoming.
[116:28.22]Where are they?
[116:29.86]Oh my god, that's a lot of people.
[116:31.56]That's a huge amount of people.
[116:34.90]Oh my god.
[116:41.10]Be careful.
[116:41.78]Be careful.
[116:57.24]Alright, move in, move in, move in.
[117:09.81]What?
[117:15.43]What?
[117:17.77]I'm so confused.
[117:18.51]Get in there, get in there, get in there.
[117:23.45]There's somebody shooting me over here.
[117:33.43]Okay, I think they moved in this way.
[117:38.76]The source of the interference is right here.
[117:42.02]It's you, you motherfucker!
[117:45.82]Alright.
[117:47.76]Move in.
[117:51.22]Are you on- I didn't know if you were on my team.
[118:00.11]Alright, let's move in.
[118:06.61]Wave 5 incoming.
[118:08.99]Alright, I'm just simulated, I can't do it anymore.
[118:16.25]Alright, I'm overstimulated.
[118:17.27]I gotta get out of here.
[118:19.81]I'm way too stimulated.
[118:20.63]I gotta go.
[118:20.89]Is that guy on my team?
[118:29.46]Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[118:31.16]I didn't mean to.
[118:37.06]Who are you shooting at?
[118:39.38]There's nobody even here.
[118:45.74]Chaos.
[118:46.00]I don't even know who's who.
[118:46.92]Alright, just kill me.
[118:56.20]Just kill me.
[118:56.66]I want to get out of this.
[118:57.91]No, I don't want to resume the cycle.
[119:07.41]I want to get out of here.
[119:15.13]That was insane.
[119:15.83]This game's crazy.
[119:16.62]Uh-oh, why are you playing Call of Duty?
[119:19.36]It's not, I mean, not Call of Duty.
[119:21.64]Ooh!
[119:22.50]Okay, let's keep going.
[119:25.84]That was Trey Pang 2.
[119:27.08]Uh, were there any more that I downloaded that last night?
[119:31.47]I'm trying to remember.
[119:33.61]Did I, do I have any more from yesterday?
[119:36.41]I think there was one.
[119:41.37]There was one that we were looking at.
[119:45.72]Which one was it, though?
[119:51.13]Because up in the top here, if you take a look, this is the... So I'm on the action tab right now.
[120:01.15]So this is action adventure.
[120:04.97]Some of these look kind of cool.
[120:07.23]Turtles.
[120:08.65]What's turtles?
[120:11.53]Casual, cute.
[120:13.21]Should I do it?
[120:15.91]Turtles looks pretty fun.
[120:19.13]Action shooter.
[120:21.23]Beat-em-up indie.
[120:24.17]This one looks good, too.
[120:27.35]Gnome Online.
[120:30.43]Play Turtles or we're going to leave.
[120:32.87]I'll play Turtles.
[120:33.61]Let's do it.
[120:34.13]Alright, I'll get Turtles.
[120:34.83]Let's do it.
[120:36.87]The stream's going to F for five seconds while I do this.
[120:41.29]Just to let you know.
[120:51.17]Okay.
[120:53.29]And let's open it.
[121:00.06]Turtles demo.
[121:03.62]Okay.
[121:06.06]Let's check this one.
[121:10.17]This is a prototype temporary assets.
[121:25.66]Okay.
[121:30.15]Turtles!
[121:33.19]Okay, let's just do it.
[121:35.53]World 1.
[121:42.36]So these globes need to turn into turtles.
[121:50.32]What is this?
[122:08.11]Okay.
[122:09.95]That was probably really loud.
[122:13.29]Uh, did I just pick these up?
[122:15.17]Oh shit, I'm messing this up.
[122:21.62]Uh oh.
[122:23.30]Alright, don't get stuck.
[122:48.02]I didn't lose to a kid's game.
[122:49.46]I'm still in literally first place.
[122:50.74]Oh, lost to a kid's game.
[122:59.19]Literally in first place.
[123:08.96]Shit.
[123:09.36]Hold on.
[123:13.40]It's kind of like snaking away.
[123:24.61]I got everybody.
[123:29.53]That's it, right?
[123:33.07]I got literally every single person.
[123:35.39]That was cute.
[123:38.96]That was that.
[123:39.56]That was really cute.
[123:40.74]What was wrong with this?
[123:45.04]That was... I liked that.
[123:46.00]That was really cute.
[123:48.38]Okay.
[123:55.83]Three stars, right?
[123:56.67]Yep.
[124:03.01]Okay, don't go down the hole, because you'll lose him if you go in the hole.
[124:06.30]Alright, I get it.
[124:08.62]There's a lot of holes.
[124:18.35]New meta.
[124:25.71]Alright, so I gotta go up, grab this one over here.
[124:29.55]What just happened?
[124:30.07]What?
[124:32.48]Oh, I held it down too long.
[124:33.70]Okay, be careful.
[124:43.74]Let's go.
[124:44.79]Okay.
[125:02.55]Everybody down?
[125:05.32]Everybody to the right?
[125:06.94]Oh, come on.
[125:08.14]No.
[125:13.66]Okay, now I'm going to have to spread them out a little.
[125:17.84]Oops.
[125:19.92]Alright, get everybody under the wall.
[125:37.97]Is that blocked?
[125:38.75]Does the seashell block?
[125:39.79]Nope.
[125:43.25]Uh-oh.
[125:55.76]Oh, shit.
[125:56.50]Hold on.
[125:59.42]Oh, fuck!
[126:00.18]Oh my god, I didn't mean to do that.
[126:01.46]Whatever.
[126:10.64]Okay.
[126:11.06]I'm done.
[126:11.70]I'm done.
[126:12.10]I'm done.
[126:12.84]I blew it so bad.
[126:15.12]I blew it really bad.
[126:17.63]I just kind of went too... Alright.
[126:20.91]Maybe one star?
[126:26.87]Two stars.
[126:27.31]Alright.
[126:32.17]Next?
[126:32.43]No.
[126:32.69]Not yet.
[126:34.07]So be careful of the birds.
[126:36.69]The birds will eat me.
[126:55.18]Oh, I get it.
[126:55.78]Okay, so you just can't be in that spot when the seagull comes.
[126:59.88]Sounds easy enough.
[127:06.23]I hope we just have one spot.
[127:24.67]How do I get away from it?
[127:26.06]How do I do this?
[127:31.88]I can't do it.
[127:57.01]No!
[127:58.52]I'm good.
[127:58.80]Did I miss an egg?
[128:13.57]Nope, we're good.
[128:28.77]Is there a time limit?
[128:30.03]Why is the music getting faster?
[128:31.71]Sounds like a time limit.
[128:32.37]How am I going to get them up there?
[128:36.97]What?
[128:37.37]I have to do it, like, one by one?
[128:42.21]Wait, I got an idea.
[129:02.61]Oh my god, forget it, whatever.
[129:30.03]This game is fun.
[129:31.05]I actually like it.
[129:32.33]I don't have very many... What?
[129:34.31]I don't have very many complaints.
[129:36.41]I really don't.
[130:02.57]I mean, is it kind of a simple little puzzle game?
[130:04.93]Sure, but... Can you... Can you find something to complain about?
[130:11.91]No, fuck this game, man.
[130:13.45]It's super cute and really easy to understand and challenging and really just kind of fun and... Where's the blood, man?
[130:25.24]How come you're not shooting anyone?
[130:29.80]What's something to complain about?
[130:30.88]I want to hear it.
[130:33.45]No, man, the game's about cute and, like, fun, and it's, like, really looks like really... Anybody can enjoy it.
[130:38.93]Dude, anybody can enjoy this.
[130:41.25]Ugh, fuck that.
[130:47.90]Tell that to the potion game.
[130:51.42]That's unfair, because the potion game... This game is pick-up-and-play.
[130:54.38]The potion game is a big story.
[131:09.19]Got it.
[131:12.15]And the potion game was really cute.
[131:13.40]What were you complaining about with the potion game?
[131:15.58]The potion game was fine too.
[131:17.10]I gave that like a 3.8.
[131:17.62]What?
[131:17.90]Oh, come on.
[131:40.51]I mean, for the fact that a lot of people are saying, I'll move on, a lot of you seem to be really, really connecting and really upset when one of the turtles gets grabbed.
[131:50.12]I thought you didn't care about this game.
[131:53.44]I thought this was like a kid's game.
[131:54.92]I don't care.
[131:57.26]You do, though, apparently.
[132:00.32]You're rooting for these turtles.
[132:01.76]You want them to succeed, just like we all do.
[132:06.74]See that move right there?
[132:22.33]Guys, not every game has to have swears in it.
[132:25.75]Not every game has to have swear words.
[132:39.41]Oops.
[132:40.93]Right when you hatched.
[132:42.53]Right when you hatched.
[132:48.13]What?
[132:55.41]I think I need to thin them out.
[132:56.79]I don't think I can get up there all the way.
[133:01.09]The seagull mechanic is really cool.
[133:02.53]You know why?
[133:02.99]Because you can't just sit here and think.
[133:05.24]It makes you have to move.
[133:07.36]I would call that a brilliant game design choice.
[133:11.10]This game is moving into the forest.
[133:12.92]I just want you to know that.
[133:33.87]3.4.
[133:33.89]I don't know.
[133:38.34]I like it.
[133:39.52]This is really cute and fun.
[133:40.66]I don't have anything to complain about.
[133:41.80]I wish I could sit here and be like, well, you know... I don't like animals.
[133:49.16]What do you want me to say?
[133:52.37]I don't like this game because I don't like turtles.
[133:54.11]I don't like reptiles and amphibians.
[133:56.13]They piss me off.
[133:58.19]Reptiles piss me off.
[134:01.84]I can't think of a reason why you would not like it.
[134:06.13]And excuse me, community.
[134:09.79]One of our favorite things of all time is a game called Super Frog.
[134:16.00]Which is far less complex than this game.
[134:22.30]Oh, I got a big one.
[134:29.81]So you can merge three?
[134:30.89]Or is that only specifically in... Let's find out.
[134:39.10]Alright, you got a new mechanic here now.
[134:46.90]That's three... Oh, no.
[134:48.11]Okay, the little ones.
[134:49.15]The ones with the smaller design.
[134:58.17]This game doesn't have candy, you don't know that yet.
[134:59.67]We just started playing it.
[135:01.65]And it's like beach, you know... Wait, I can combine.
[135:04.89]I need to combine.
[135:38.99]Yeah, it's summertime.
[135:42.46]It's nice out.
[135:46.44]Somebody said, check your CPU and GPU usage to make sure this is not a... Oh, come on.
[135:53.80]Please.
[135:54.50]No, that's... Things just can't be fun and simple with, like, a cool mechanic...
[136:09.14]Shit, this is gonna be hard.
[136:18.73]Did I get them all?
[136:21.31]I think I did, right?
[136:25.21]I did.
[136:25.49]I got everybody.
[136:26.03]Can I combine the big turtles?
[136:36.05]Oh, almost three.
[136:43.08]Alright, well, I think I'm almost at the end of the demo.
[136:45.98]We'll do one or two more.
[136:47.40]I like it.
[136:48.18]Three big ones makes a bigger one.
[136:56.63]Yeah.
[136:57.63]Almost 90% of you guys like turtles.
[137:00.19]You'll be buying this game when it comes out.
[137:01.91]I guarantee it.
[137:08.38]And then a year after this comes out, you're still going to be listening to the soundtrack.
[137:13.41]And in your YouTube history, it will be Turtles Steam OST.
[137:17.57]You can't fool me.
[137:18.99]Get a game over before you stop playing?
[137:22.20]Yeah, that sounds fair.
[137:49.13]Which we don't have to do all of them, right?
[137:53.15]It's not like, oh my god, we have to play every single demo.
[137:55.48]This is just a cool... I like this event a lot.
[138:01.96]It makes it so, stuff that I never would have even cared about, it's just, I'm gonna try it because it's just there.
[138:09.99]It's just available, and you can just get it and try it.
[138:13.19]And the games aren't out yet.
[138:14.47]I would probably be less excited about this event if the games that you could download were games that were like, oh, they've been out already.
[138:20.70]But these are most of these.
[138:21.54]I think all of them are not out yet.
[138:23.72]That's really cool.
[138:26.24]It's like a little taste, like a little sneak peek.
[138:30.08]I gotta combine some, yeah.
[138:31.06]Alright, give me that.
[138:34.12]Let's combine the big ones.
[138:37.62]Oh, shit.
[138:42.11]Oh shit!
[138:43.44]Fine.
[139:12.33]Got it.
[139:14.09]Hey, what's going on here?
[139:16.61]That's three.
[139:19.38]That was three.
[139:19.82]What happened?
[139:26.00]I missed an egg?
[139:28.52]I can't miss an egg.
[139:30.28]Why did the three big ones not combine?
[139:40.27]Oh, fuck you.
[139:43.31]I should even come back down here.
[140:01.26]So why won't they combine?
[140:05.36]There's three in a row.
[140:15.67]They're too big.
[140:16.85]I thought the big ones could combine too.
[140:26.09]And this is temporary assets?
[140:29.49]So they told me this game's only gonna get better.
[140:30.90]Alright, this is the last one.
[140:39.80]Oh, that's the pattern for the big ones.
[140:41.18]I get it.
[140:41.46]So it's gotta be in like a triangle.
[140:47.85]Yeah, games get scores for different reasons.
[140:51.51]If I give this like a 4.3, which I'm not going to, but if I do, and the game I played before this was like a 4.2 or something, remember, this is based on... It's like a 4... It's a 4.1 for the genre that it is in.
[141:10.88]This does not mean that this game is better than any of the more elaborate demos we've played.
[141:16.36]This is a 4.1 in the category of puzzle, fun, kids-based, children's type games.
[141:22.89]You know what I mean?
[141:24.57]Like, entertainment, E for everyone, puzzle, like kids can play it, old people can play it, I can play it, you can play it, 20 year olds can play it, 40 year olds can play it, E for everybody.
[141:39.50]I think I'm in trouble here.
[142:07.58]go faster I'm doing fine yeah no not even kids not even kids game I'm just saying like anybody can play it and enjoy it anybody I gotta go this way no I gotta wrap around
[142:34.81]I would rather just go crawl on the beach.
[142:38.39]Yeah, okay.
[142:39.21]So go to the beach then.
[142:42.28]Why do you have to have one or the other?
[142:44.78]Nah, dude.
[142:47.80]I don't want to play this.
[142:48.46]I'd rather go to the beach instead.
[142:50.92]You can still do that.
[142:51.87]You don't have to just not go.
[142:53.09]What do you mean?
[142:53.83]Why are you choosing to go to to the beach or play this game?
[142:58.97]Nah, I'd rather go to the... Alright.
[143:03.73]Alright, let me make a big one.
[143:04.96]A really big one.
[143:05.56]Boom.
[143:10.47]Nice.

[144:01.40]Everyone's having such a good time.
[144:03.14]That's so cute.
[144:03.88]I love it.
[144:13.60]This is psychotic?
[144:14.94]How is this... How is this psychotic?
[144:18.66]People are dancing to a fun song?
[144:32.92]I'm so distracted by the dancing.
[144:39.18]I feel like the dancing is getting faster when I look over here.
[144:43.04]It looks like the dancing is getting faster.
[144:44.46]No.
[144:50.24]Oh, God.
[144:53.83]Oh, I can't see.
[145:08.29]Fucking doing a move It is getting faster you're freaking me out It actually is getting faster No get down get down get down get down Fuck oh my god I swear to God

[146:14.42]Alright, I got it.
[146:15.02]Go, go, go, go.
[146:38.27]I'm losing my mind.
[146:38.97]Honestly, I keep looking over there and it's making it worse.
[147:09.55]Get over here.
[147:12.83]Okay, I'm good.
[147:13.53]Nice.
[147:21.34]This is 4.1.
[147:21.76]This one's 4.1.
[147:38.69]Without a doubt.
[147:42.01]Very cool.
[147:44.82]There it is.
[147:46.74]There's turtles.
[147:49.62]Listable on Steam right now.
[149:24.77]I just wanted to fuck with you for a second.
[149:27.19]Alright, that was Turtles.
[149:29.27]What else we got?
[149:29.75]Let's take a look.
[149:32.29]Turtles, remember, with an exclamation point.
[149:35.10]Turtles, exclamation point.
[149:37.38]That's very, very... I'm sure if you probably type in Turtles, you probably wouldn't get it.
[149:43.96]What else we got on that list?
[149:45.54]Of action games.
[149:51.05]Let's take a look.
[149:52.67]Um...
[149:55.54]There's also open world stuff too.
[150:00.22]Turtles.
[150:02.97]Bloodhound.
[150:06.85]This looks like another kind of shooter game.
[150:09.71]Scrap Riders.
[150:13.61]Is this a beat-em-up?
[150:18.10]Less FPS?
[150:19.52]Yeah, we've done a lot of FPS.
[150:20.44]That's right.
[150:24.49]Is this game's FPS but looks good?
[150:28.85]No, okay.
[150:29.35]What about it's like another page?
[150:34.82]What is this?
[150:35.24]A cooking game?
[150:37.62]Fribbles.
[150:40.80]Crafting, agriculture, creature collection.
[150:53.66]I think I'm going to click on this one.
[150:56.08]Hold on.
[150:56.32]Let's not go too hasty.
[150:57.16]Hold on.
[150:58.88]Westwood Shadows.
[151:00.15]Survival Horror.
[151:05.31]Is it FPS?
[151:07.55]Oddworld?
[151:08.27]There's a new Oddworld coming out?
[151:14.04]Okay.
[151:14.16]Okay.
[151:16.14]Astronite.
[151:17.85]Looks pretty cool.
[151:19.35]Sort of retro Game Boy style 2D game.
[151:22.95]Play Slayers X. Well, hold on.
[151:25.77]I just want to take a look at a few pages.
[151:30.06]Far Star.
[151:33.44]Panic Porcupine.
[151:35.86]This is like a Sonic the Hedgehog game.
[151:40.89]It says difficult.
[151:42.23]It says difficult.
[151:45.27]Panic Porcupine.
[151:48.67]Okay.
[151:52.62]Ooh, parkour.
[151:54.30]This could be fun.
[151:55.62]I might puke, though.
[151:59.70]It's a 2D game.
[152:01.64]Dreadhaunt.
[152:06.22]Take a couple pages.
[152:07.28]Hold on.
[152:11.02]Undead Pixel Monks.
[152:13.98]Gust of Wind.
[152:19.68]I see stealth there.
[152:20.40]I'm not sure I want to click it.
[152:22.52]It looks pretty cool, though.
[152:26.62]Kingdom Gun?
[152:32.43]Zolotl?
[152:36.89]Fight of Steel.
[152:39.09]Whoa, what is this?
[152:41.96]Do you make your own cyber fighter?
[152:45.72]Maybe.
[152:45.86]Maybe.
[152:49.85]EXP war trauma.
[152:52.75]Psychological horror.
[152:54.71]Goodbye, Dr. Sanchez.
[152:59.57]Mythic.
[153:02.86]Alright, alright.
[153:03.40]I don't want to get overwhelmed.
[153:08.06]What is this?
[153:13.62]Zombies and keys.
[153:14.76]Alright.
[153:15.70]Let me go back.
[153:18.29]We're going to do flibbles.
[153:20.05]Yeah, flibbles time.
[153:20.93]Let's go.
[153:22.69]That's the one I'm most interested in right now.
[153:31.34]You're going to get a minor F here.
[153:37.06]And then maybe I'll go to... I don't know this so much.
[153:41.95]Why did I not do this for the last two weeks?
[153:45.03]I was busy, whatever.
[153:46.97]I'm going to be busy this week, this like next six or seven days too.
[153:51.20]A lot of stuff going on.
[153:53.32]Not just in kind of the stream world, but in my personal life too.
[153:58.40]A lot of things I need to do.
[154:01.14]It's very busy.
[154:06.48]You look like Gigachad today.
[154:13.73]I don't think so.
[154:19.01]Okay, we're good to go.
[154:27.63]Flibbles.
[154:34.52]That was loud, but... Okay.
[154:39.12]Are you guys ready for flibbles?
[154:44.44]Whoa, this is actually weird.
[154:47.12]Look at this.
[154:49.83]This is kind of weird.
[154:55.63]Oh, this is weird.
[154:56.83]Okay, should I use controller?
[154:59.81]Let's turn the, alright, settings.
[155:04.28]Well, I can turn this down.
[155:06.82]Wait, can I do it from here?
[155:08.92]I can do it from here.
[155:16.36]Can I not turn the audio down?
[155:19.59]Oh shit, the audio is not coded into the game yet.
[155:25.25]Okay, so I do have to do this.
[155:28.39]Okay.
[155:45.53]That's better.
[155:51.86]So, I cannot change this.
[155:53.46]It's probably very early.
[155:55.12]Alright, let's go Flibbles.
[156:00.76]I have really high hopes for Flibbles.
[156:02.28]Come on, look at this!
[156:03.14]This is perfect.
[156:04.86]Come on, Flibbles!
[156:10.53]Continue?
[156:11.03]I didn't do anything.
[156:13.11]Do it again.
[156:19.67]Alright, both headphones going for this.
[156:31.67]This music!
[156:40.06]Wait, I can actually... Hold on.
[156:42.58]Interact?
[156:45.68]How do I... Oh, okay.
[156:48.08]Um, forward?
[156:52.75]It's a five.
[156:53.61]It's starting at five.
[156:54.33]Um, okay.
[156:56.35]We're gonna do controller.
[157:20.74]Escape, open task, move, aim, interact, jump, look around, throw, shoot, dash, interact with flibbles.
[157:36.58]I can dash?
[157:39.76]Interact with the crates.
[157:42.30]Where are the crates?
[157:49.71]I can't, man.
[157:53.30]Okay, interact with the crates?
[157:54.30]Where are the crates?
[157:56.30]Over here?
[158:01.65]Aim with up and down?
[158:02.93]Okay, aim.
[158:08.53]Why do I have dynamite?
[158:19.92]Why would I do that?
[158:22.47]Craft dynamite in the crafting menu!
[158:27.45]Uh, dude.
[158:29.39]What are you talking about?
[158:31.71]Why would I want to make dynamite?
[158:32.89]It says, you've got a friend in me.
[158:47.70]You've got a friend in me.
[158:50.48]Certain people...
[158:52.19]Having one of a life, and I have... That's it, right?
[159:03.67]Somebody post the lyrics in the chat right now, I'll do it.
[159:07.23]Post the lyrics.
[159:08.11]I don't care if it's spammed, I don't give a shit.
[159:09.72]Post the lyrics to the song and I'll do it.
[159:11.54]Alright, I'm going off-cam for this.
[159:17.34]Give me the lyrics to the song.
[159:20.63]Actually, can one of the mods do it in the mod chat?
[159:22.97]Yeah, guys, don't do it, don't do it.
[159:24.25]I'll do it.
[159:24.59]Somebody in the mod chat do it.
[159:27.54]Just, like, copy the text and paste it.
[159:35.00]Oh, hold on.
[159:35.66]I can't see this.
[159:40.74]I'm gonna try.
[159:41.54]Here we go.
[159:46.85]Wait, I'll get it on the next cycle.
[159:51.37]You got a friend in me You've got a friend in me When the road looks good

[160:44.92]I've got them too.
[160:46.43]They're in anything I wouldn't do for you.
[160:52.39]We stick together and see it through.
[160:56.01]Cause you've got a friend in me.
[161:00.79]Yep, you've... Some other... Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am.
[161:11.87]Bigger and stronger too.
[161:15.36]maybe but none of them ever will ever love you what the what the that's what he says the way I do it's me and you and as the years go by our friendship will never die you're gonna see it's our destiny
[161:50.62]That la- that lyric, no one's ever gonna love you?
[161:52.62]What the hell?
[161:55.46]I'm back.
[162:01.68]You're hurting us.
[162:03.80]I know.
[162:05.58]Alright, so I have dynamite.
[162:06.78]What do I do with the dynamite?
[162:11.85]Craft dynamite in the crafting machine.
[162:13.41]Alright.
[162:35.19]Wait.
[162:47.72]What do I do with all this?
[162:52.28]What do I do with this?
[162:58.02]I put it in the crafting machine!
[163:01.86]Does anybody know what to do?
[163:13.49]Do I light the fuse?
[163:14.27]What do I do with this stuff?
[163:15.27]Fish for flibbles?
[163:45.70]You have to craft it first.
[163:46.76]Didn't I just do... Okay, so... Okay.
[163:49.04]Crafting machine.
[163:50.10]So I put this in here.
[163:55.85]And then one of these things here.
[163:59.27]And then it's going to spit out a dynamite.
[164:01.07]Okay, I have a dynamite now.
[164:03.35]Now I can... Will this explode if I throw it?
[164:11.97]How do I turn it on?
[164:15.58]Okay, go fish for... Where do I fish for them?
[164:32.25]Into the phone?
[164:35.85]Where's the phone?
[164:51.12]This is GTA, original Grand Theft Auto 1.
[164:53.92]That just threw me back.
[164:56.29]Jack, it's an emergency.
[164:57.33]Flibberland is in danger.
[164:59.15]A purple goo substance appeared out of nowhere.
[165:01.61]It consumes everything that comes in contact with it.
[165:05.13]We managed to find out that you can use water to fend it off, and I beg of you.
[165:12.44]I can't.
[165:20.75]People probably hate me right now, it's alright.
[165:31.01]I don't wanna like hurt anybody's head.
[165:37.74]I have a weapon?
[165:46.70]Okay, I need to craft a water gun.
[166:09.79]What's going on?
[166:12.49]Oh, shit, nice!
[166:13.21]Okay, I can put some... I can fertilize that.
[166:14.89]What happened?
[166:15.23]Alright, I don't want to make... Wait, wait, wait, I gotta... This game is so cute.
[166:24.02]I like this.
[166:30.26]What does it need?
[166:31.82]Okay, I need, like, a handle?
[166:40.15]Oh, right here.
[166:55.12]Put it in!
[166:56.94]No, put it in!
[166:59.26]Don't make me scream, you've got a friend.
[167:02.62]Oh my god.
[167:03.30]That's how you get around.
[167:22.62]Okay, now give it to me.
[167:26.04]What else does it need?
[167:27.04]Oh, it needs like a barrel.
[167:28.08]Okay.
[167:38.81]I just... What just... I hurt somebody.
[167:40.61]Oh, no.
[167:41.13]That was that.
[167:44.26]I need like a handle.
[167:45.02]Oh, there it is.
[167:56.12]There it is.
[167:56.44]Alright, I got it.
[167:57.82]Fill up your ammo with the fountain.
[168:01.49]Jim, will you smoke cigarettes on stream?
[168:05.85]Somebody asks me that every day.
[168:12.27]Why?
[168:12.83]What are you doing?
[168:14.49]What are you doing?
[168:15.25]Uh-oh.
[168:17.57]We're under attack.
[168:40.55]Defend!
[168:43.89]Defend!
[168:44.31]Defend!
[168:44.63]Defend us!
[168:45.55]Defend!
[168:46.85]Defend!
[168:48.60]Get him!
[168:49.56]Attack!
[168:52.50]Get him!
[168:57.31]They're eating my tomatoes!
[169:29.98]See you in hell.
[169:30.64]Give me the gun.
[169:44.02]Shoot the what?
[169:47.12]Grab the bag to shoot seeds.
[169:54.73]You know what I'll say about this game?
[169:59.56]It's super clean.
[170:01.28]It's so shiny.
[170:06.09]It's so shiny.
[170:07.87]How do you get the game to look like that?
[170:20.08]Look at how shiny everything is.
[170:22.02]The graphics look really... I like the graphics.
[170:24.26]Look at that guy.
[170:25.90]When do they stop?
[170:33.17]Who's that little guy?
[170:34.01]They've eaten almost every single tomato on the farm.
[170:46.59]Oh, that was a huge burp.
[171:05.66]Will you guys do something?
[171:06.74]They're just walking around.
[171:08.96]Did he kill my tree trunk guy?
[171:10.66]Oh, these are flibbles.
[171:18.82]Okay.
[171:28.10]Did I get it?
[171:28.50]I think there's a bug in my head.
[171:38.02]How am I so bad?
[171:40.54]What are you talking about?
[171:41.58]I... How do I turn off this thing that's shooting him out?
[171:49.99]How do I close the portal?
[171:54.26]Close the portal!
[171:57.46]I don't have a farm anymore!
[172:11.88]I got goofied?
[172:12.66]This is scary.
[172:47.86]I like this one.
[172:49.86]We got that you got a friend in me out of it.
[172:57.79]Let's do another one.
[173:01.59]Rate the game.
[173:02.39]Hmm.
[173:18.89]You know what?
[173:20.43]I think that game is charming.
[173:24.07]I think that game is charming.
[173:28.99]Although I will say it was a little weird crafting dynamite.
[173:37.88]Is it over a two?
[173:38.52]I...
[173:44.86]I think... Okay.
[173:46.54]I needed to see more about... I needed to see more flibbles, I think.
[173:48.70]I needed to see more flibbles, I think.
[173:54.35]I played that for as long... I played that for a long time.
[173:59.89]I played that for a while.
[174:05.01]Alright, let's keep looking.

[174:20.50]Oh my goodness.
[174:25.08]Should I do this one?
[174:36.91]Yeah.
[174:38.93]Yep.
[174:41.65]I'm playing Pirates.
[174:42.53]I'm playing Pirates Bay.
[174:48.74]I want to give it a try.
[174:54.72]And then let's queue up a couple.
[174:57.64]So let's keep that on here.
[175:01.10]What about other open world?

[176:34.15]And then we'll have three to do here.

[182:12.04]Something weird in that water.
[182:12.96]I'm not much of a swimmer though.
[182:15.28]Something weird?

[182:21.06]Tastes fine to me.

[183:48.48]Is that how much health he had?
[183:50.98]Oh my god.
[184:14.36]I got this.
[184:14.82]I'm doing it again.
[184:19.50]I'm in the wall!
[184:50.53]Fuck, I'm gonna die again.
[184:58.75]What is this?
[184:59.27]I can't use a spell, I don't have any mana.
[185:22.54]Ooh.

[186:08.83]Alright, heal up.
[186:09.75]Good.
[186:10.03]Let's keep going.
[186:37.62]Did you drop anything else?
[186:40.26]What game is this?
[186:40.70]This is called Frog Monster.
[186:44.10]Frog Monster.
[186:44.82]Found a piece of mana upgrade.
[186:48.49]I'll take it.
[186:49.07]Okay.
[186:53.27]Go back down?
[186:53.73]Okay.
[187:07.82]Yeah, what's this called?
[187:08.64]It's got stuff with a V, right?
[187:11.34]The cubes, when you put them all together.
[187:14.50]Stuff with a V of, uh... What can I think of it?
[187:18.29]Voxel, yeah.
[187:25.93]This is cute.
[187:29.07]No, not virgin.
[187:33.32]Ooh, this is pretty.
[188:07.07]This is, this is nice.
[188:09.06]This is nice.
[188:38.71]Jeremy, are these the kind of shrooms that you smoke?
[188:41.67]But you don't smoke shrooms.
[188:42.87]I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
[188:45.60]You get to live.
[188:47.24]How does he know?
[188:49.32]Why wouldn't I know that?
[189:10.32]Ooh, cool.
[189:12.20]Shit.
[189:12.96]Alright, one more try.
[189:17.15]That's it.
[189:18.99]I'm done with this one.
[189:20.99]One more try.
[189:41.20]You suck at this game.
[189:43.00]The game's kind of tricky!
[189:44.39]One more try and that's it.
[190:23.25]Alright.
[190:27.45]Environments are beautiful and the gameplay has a lot of potential.
[190:30.16]Sound design and music need a lot of work.
[190:33.84]I would agree with that.
[190:36.22]But here's the thing.
[190:37.66]And this is something that's really important.
[190:42.09]If you really think about it, it's probably less than five to ten people doing this.
[190:48.76]So that's why all these games, right?
[190:51.14]Well, most of them, right?
[190:54.74]You are never gonna hear me say, like, oh, wow, this game's fucking awful, right?
[191:00.67]Like, why would I do that?
[191:02.53]It takes a lot of fucking guts to kind of put yourself out there and do this kind of shit.
[191:07.01]It does.
[191:08.37]And if you only have, like, a few people, like, especially if it's only one or two people...
[191:17.04]I mean, this is remarkable for it being a small team, right?
[191:21.36]Yeah, you gotta... I don't want... Here's the thing.
[191:24.88]I think discouraging people from doing something that they're passionate about and they think is cool... And this is good.
[191:31.67]This is actually fucking good.
[191:35.27]I wouldn't be able to do something like this, even if I really spent time on it.
[191:38.79]I don't ever want anyone to think that, like, oh, my game's fucking bad.
[191:43.49]Oh, shit.
[191:44.95]No, I don't want somebody to... I don't want to, like, rain on somebody's passion, rain on somebody's, you know, way to try to make a living and everything, right?
[191:52.05]I'm not gonna do that.
[191:55.83]Could this game use a little work?
[191:57.43]Uh, yeah, it absolutely fucking could.
[192:01.38]But... I think it's fun.
[192:04.76]I think this is good shit.
[192:07.24]A little bit more time in the oven, this thing could be fucking fantastic.
[192:15.35]Now, yes, you've heard me say... Yeah, alright, hold on.
[192:18.07]But, like, fuck Capcom is a little different.
[192:21.79]It's not... That's not like three people making Resident Evil 8, okay?
[192:25.17]There's no one guy didn't make Resident Evil 8.
[192:33.78]If they did, holy shit, that would be a crowning achievement.
[192:38.17]Shit, I missed.
[192:42.25]No!
[192:47.67]I'm dead.
[192:48.15]Is it a unique vision?
[192:54.24]Yeah, this is a time for us to come together as gamers.
[192:58.98]I'm a gamer, don't forget.
[193:02.28]And celebrate all the cool shit that people are making that's coming up, right?
[193:10.46]So, I'm... The rating system is more of a joke than anything else.
[193:15.01]I don't... It's not actually accurate, right?
[193:16.53]Because these are demos.
[193:17.63]It's not like... It's not like this is the full experience.
[193:21.37]Some of these games are a year away.
[193:24.51]Just admit that you hate this.
[193:26.74]What?
[193:27.00]I don't!
[193:27.98]Oh, no, you didn't say this.
[193:28.78]Admit that you hate video games.
[193:30.36]You know, I kind of do!
[193:32.70]I kinda do, okay?
[193:44.17]Same, same, same.
[193:45.18]Alright, so we agree then.
[193:46.22]We agree.
[193:59.28]Alright, last try and that's it.
[194:01.56]Really gonna actually try on this one.
[194:10.74]No, okay, hold on.
[194:16.36]Geeks... Why do you have to be such a positive Peter?
[194:23.06]I'm really not even a positive Peter.
[194:24.80]Those of you guys that have been here for a long time...
[194:28.52]I'm not really.
[194:29.32]Positive Peter.
[194:31.98]He's a positive Peter.
[194:33.66]Come on.
[194:57.23]Now, I cannot reliably tell you that a game is good or bad based on a 15 minute demo.
[195:02.88]That's impossible.
[195:03.92]That's not possible.
[195:12.19]I actually like what I'm doing.
[195:13.77]It's fun.
[195:21.03]This game's called Frog Monster.
[195:23.13]One word.
[195:25.31]Turn the music down a little.
[195:30.08]There we go.
[195:47.00]That's kind of the point of a demo, to see if you like it.
[195:49.55]Oh yeah!
[195:53.53]Don't die, please.
[195:58.03]Smash.
[195:58.75]Smash.
[195:59.43]Smash.
[196:00.05]Smash.
[196:00.71]Smash.
[196:01.13]Alright, that's it.
[196:03.71]That was fun.
[196:04.41]That was called Frog Monster.
[196:08.51]That's somewhere in the threes.
[196:19.62]I actually like the death screen.
[196:20.52]I think it's cool.
[196:22.83]Alright, coming up next, we've got, uh, what was it called?
[196:32.22]Please do Slayer's X. I will.
[196:40.86]Oh, cat, right.
[196:42.82]Grand Theft Gato.
[196:44.86]Vice Kitty.
[197:14.60]Turn the graphics up.
[197:21.61]Okay, so I think this is good.
[197:23.55]How does this work?
[197:38.50]Press B to meow.
[197:46.18]Good cats can navigate.
[197:47.62]Press M to view the local map.
[197:50.83]Holy shit, this is a whole city!
[197:52.15]Okay.
[197:59.05]Hi, it's great to see you.
[197:59.75]You can really get hungry earning likes and subscribers.
[198:04.92]We're out of food again.
[198:05.86]I'll get it.
[198:06.24]The downstairs door is locked.
[198:09.26]We're trapped in here.
[198:11.89]The man is too tired to shop.
[198:13.17]Maybe he needs some candy.
[198:14.43]Okay.
[198:15.51]Find the human 10 candy.
[198:18.06]There's candy in the box.
[198:24.48]Okay.
[198:24.74]Alright, here's candy.
[198:50.21]Okay.
[198:51.91]He'll go shopping soon.
[198:52.84]Now there's a cat downstairs.
[198:53.90]He wants to talk to you.
[198:54.72]Let's go.
[198:54.98]The fucking... What do you do?
[198:58.10]What?
[199:02.18]Get the hell away from me.
[199:03.18]This cat's going to kick me?
[199:08.93]What the fuck?
[199:15.05]Oh my god, I'm on his head.
[199:16.23]What the fuck is happening?
[199:26.33]Get this guy out of here!
[199:28.95]Am I ready?
[199:30.27]Find the strange cat.
[199:31.33]Okay.
[199:35.39]Pawnzilla.
[199:37.33]Want some sick power-ups?
[199:38.37]Yes.
[199:39.97]Okay, ever heard of XP?
[199:41.37]It piles up as you do awesome, but it's useless by itself.
[199:45.29]You gotta spend it, cat.
[199:46.77]Open your inventory and look at the upper left corner.
[199:48.65]Oh, okay.
[200:04.05]Are those hairballs?
[200:07.12]I'm not big, but you need me.
[200:08.98]Okay, what do I need?
[200:09.52]Okay.
[200:09.62]Oh, alright.
[200:31.50]Yes, love cheese, I guess.
[200:36.27]What?
[200:38.85]I can't stand this stuff.
[200:39.57]Why is my name Mouse3 anyway?
[200:41.11]This world makes no sense.
[200:42.15]Alright, let's go.
[200:42.67]Wait.
[201:02.46]Are you ready?
[201:03.22]I believe.
[201:04.70]Climb the bookcase over there, jump at it, left click, and hold.
[201:17.45]How?
[201:21.51]What the fuck?
[201:24.79]I got the candy, I got it.
[201:25.61]I can climb anything?
[201:35.35]Okay, I can climb anything.
[201:44.25]Find the strange cat.
[201:50.45]You can climb anything.
[201:55.09]Are you the strange cat?
[202:06.53]What does that sound?
[202:08.21]What?
[202:09.61]How much for level one melee?
[202:13.45]How do we see that?
[202:13.97]How do I get to that menu?
[202:19.54]How do I get to that menu?
[202:35.24]Okay, got it.
[202:35.68]Alright, I gotta find the strange cat downstairs.
[202:41.86]How do I get downstairs?
[202:42.66]There we go.
[202:53.70]Meowthius.
[202:55.00]Okay.
[202:58.96]Talk to my crew.
[202:59.67]They will show you the way to the outside world.
[203:03.52]My crew is on the second floor.
[203:08.34]I can only give you the keys to the door.
[203:09.60]You must walk through it.
[203:10.62]Find Mayor Mittens and your destiny.
[203:14.87]Open your inventory and equip the keys.
[203:16.35]Okay.
[203:30.50]How do I get out of here?
[203:41.95]I'm out.
[203:42.97]Let's go.
[203:43.31]Can you drive a car?
[203:46.31]Can I drive a car?
[203:48.59]What the fuck?
[203:49.59]You can drive a car?
[203:51.29]Why can't I drive a car?
[204:04.81]Dirty whiskers.
[204:09.49]Sorry, you know, this is the demo.
[204:11.07]But hey, what's the next best thing to owning the game?
[204:14.97]Wish listing it on Steam, because that's where all the stuff is coming out.
[204:17.55]Don't you want to do it?
[204:19.18]I'm not going to click that, because I think it might actually do it.
[204:21.02]I don't know.
[204:21.32]I'm afraid to, like, click that button.
[204:22.34]Alright, so where do I go?
[204:55.17]Did I kill that guy?
[205:38.56]What's going on here?
[205:40.52]Okay, alright, well, what's going on here?
[205:54.76]What happened?
[205:58.04]Diesel tools?
[206:01.85]Wait, maybe you can tell me.
[206:04.27]Give me fuel, give me fire.
[206:10.01]They're cheering on a race?
[206:12.19]Oh, okay, let's go.
[206:13.80]You ready?
[206:15.42]Three, two, one, go!
[206:26.16]The car... I'm telling you right now, I dropped... Give me the controller.
[206:28.46]I think it's probably going to be easier.
[206:34.29]Nope.
[206:38.77]What?
[206:42.03]I died.
[206:42.39]I can't jump?
[206:55.98]Whatever.
[206:57.22]Oh, wait, somebody here.
[206:57.88]Alright, there's Mayor Mittens.
[207:04.87]Okay, here we go.
[207:07.27]You want to work for me?
[207:08.07]Yes.
[207:10.05]Oh my god, a lackey of my own.
[207:12.03]You've made it.
[207:12.57]Okay, right, work.
[207:15.45]To be my helper, you need wheels.
[207:18.33]There's a small car to your right.
[207:20.69]Go take it for... Small car.
[207:30.30]Okay, hi Ed.
[207:32.90]WASD to drive.
[207:57.63]I'm holding the button.
[207:59.95]Why does it keep cycling through gears?
[208:06.69]The car doesn't sound right.
[208:08.07]I'm not even holding the acceleration.
[208:24.59]Well, to be fair, a cat wouldn't know how to use a manual.
[208:39.84]I mean, not yet.
[208:47.93]Oh, I gotta do 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[208:49.17]Okay.
[209:02.39]Where's three?
[209:08.23]Where's three?
[209:08.53]I know not yet.
[209:21.33]I'm trying to go over here.
[209:31.42]It's way too dank.
[209:32.16]Alright, the turning is a little slow.
[209:48.37]Don't... Okay.
[209:50.03]Four, five, six.
[210:01.44]Four.
[210:04.38]Five.
[210:08.84]Six.
[210:10.60]No, wait, that was six.
[210:11.52]Alright, what do you need mittens?
[210:16.75]Okay.
[210:21.37]Brave to the big time?
[210:22.09]I got some real work now.
[210:23.01]This is gonna be intense.
[210:24.31]Get ready.
[210:25.89]Person was making a tree for it, and now they're stuck in the tree.
[210:29.84]Crazy day, right?
[210:30.50]Need to go get them down.
[210:31.46]Okay.
[210:31.56]Over there.
[210:32.26]Alright, let's go.
[210:32.90]Where's my car?
[211:00.57]I don't need a car.
[211:27.08]Why can't this guy get down?
[211:28.30]I don't understand.
[211:30.42]Why you can't get down?
[211:31.74]Okay, let's go.
[211:47.27]You're welcome.
[211:56.23]What game is this?
[211:56.67]This game is called Grand Theft Gato Vice Kitty.
[212:00.43]Okay.
[212:08.69]Signed up my amazing helper cat.
[212:11.57]Your reward is a new toy.
[212:12.61]Maybe it's a gun, a pack, a thingy.
[212:14.85]Okay.
[212:17.69]Works in a garage over by the apartments.
[212:19.57]Tell him I'm counting on his vote.
[212:20.69]Okay.
[212:27.05]Let's move.
[212:29.93]This gets at least five letter grades because of the title?
[212:33.07]Oh, give me this car.
[212:49.71]Wait, where is this?
[212:54.69]Oh, it's right here.
[213:01.69]Okay.
[213:06.54]I made something amazing.
[213:07.52]A Cat Pack 9000.
[213:08.72]Assemble the pieces.
[213:14.34]Okay.
[213:27.34]I yawned, but I don't want to be yawning on camera.
[213:29.89]Don't fucking drive off the edge.
[213:41.39]I got another one.
[213:41.87]It's fine.
[213:43.43]Alright, find the pieces.
[213:46.29]End of the stream, boys?
[213:47.03]No.
[213:47.45]No, I'm fine.
[213:51.42]I'll go refill my tea.
[213:53.98]Wait, where is this stuff?
[213:55.96]Was it right next to me?
[214:09.21]T means he's going to go smoke a bowl.
[214:17.00]No, not right now.
[214:21.42]Where is this stuff?
[214:25.55]Oh, it's up here.
[214:30.75]I don't smoke weed.
[214:31.51]I eat it.
[214:31.91]I like it better.
[214:46.09]You know why I like to eat it?
[214:47.91]By the way, if you're over 21, it's illegal in your area, and just be careful.
[214:54.15]All things in moderation.
[214:56.76]When I smoke weed, I don't like how fast smoking weed hits you, and then it's just gone.
[215:02.88]It's like, boom.
[215:04.64]It's an absolute explosion.
[215:06.98]Just, and then it's gone in like 30 minutes.
[215:13.02]I like the feeling of letting it kind of work up for an hour or two, and then you can stay in that kind of mellow state, whatever you want to be in, for a few hours.
[215:23.66]I like it.
[215:30.91]That's why I like to eat it.
[215:40.67]30 minutes?
[215:40.95]It's like four hours for me.
[215:43.91]Um, I don't have very much experience with smoking.
[215:47.11]I'd rather eat it.
[215:47.95]So, but the few times I've done it, it was just like so, I was like too, too much.
[215:53.52]And it just hit me like a truck for like half an hour to an hour.
[215:56.12]And then you just have to come down.
[215:59.26]I feel a little... I know a lot of people are the opposite.
[216:02.51]Where it's like, if you take... If you eat it, and all of a sudden you're... You don't want to be high for four or five hours, right?
[216:10.07]Because that's sometimes if you do edibles or whatever, that can happen.
[216:16.78]I get that.
[216:17.18]I get it completely.
[216:24.73]How do I get on the roof?
[216:34.91]It's also what your body's used to.
[216:35.99]Yeah, that's true.
[216:41.19]How do I get on the roof?
[216:44.75]Edibles can really sneak up on you.
[216:46.09]Yes, they can.
[216:46.65]That's why you should really be very careful with it.
[216:59.08]Really depends on the person.
[217:00.96]Oh, yeah.
[217:03.30]If you like smoking it versus eating it.
[217:06.32]Absolutely.
[217:09.22]Alright, I'm done.
[217:10.70]We're going to do another one.
[217:13.15]Let me get some tea.
[217:15.55]I need to perk up a little.
[217:17.37]I need to pick me up.
[217:20.29]That was Grand Theft Gato Vice Kitty.
[217:23.25]It was pretty fun.
[217:25.06]I think the music is probably my favorite part.
[217:29.14]I'll be right back and refill my water.
[217:30.94]Get some tea with it.
[217:32.38]I'll see you in like 2-3 minutes.
[217:34.06]Maybe 5 minutes.
[217:36.01]BRB.
[218:14.89]I'm still here.
[218:15.33]I just wanted to... Somebody mentioned the... So when I get tea...
[218:22.50]Some of the time I get something called liquid IV.
[218:25.18]And somebody said, be careful.
[218:25.98]Those things have 100 milligrams of caffeine.
[218:28.58]So yeah, dude, this is my tactic with it.
[218:31.43]I usually only do half a packet.
[218:32.73]I usually do about, it's about 40 milligrams of caffeine.
[218:39.39]Liquid IV is amazing.
[218:40.47]Yes.
[218:45.36]It's got a kind of a strange name.
[218:49.92]No, not 100 milligrams of THC.
[218:51.62]What the fuck are you talking about?
[218:52.84]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[218:54.34]We're talking about two completely different things.
[218:56.68]Let me separate this out.
[218:59.63]The powder that I use... This green tea powder, right?
[219:04.03]This matcha powder.
[219:06.39]And this Liquid IV is the name of the brand or whatever.
[219:10.39]It's like a little packet.
[219:14.99]100 milligrams of caffeine is not that big of a deal.
[219:19.81]Cup of coffee is, what, 80?
[219:22.26]70 to 90?
[219:23.34]So that's not a big deal.
[219:28.54]One cup of coffee is less than 100.
[219:30.74]A little bit less than 100.
[219:34.71]Something between 40, 50, 60, yeah.
[219:37.79]Regular green tea is 30.
[219:41.91]Yeah, no, I am not drinking... Let me be really clear about this.
[219:44.77]I really like these things.
[219:46.03]They've been... I've been drinking a lot of them over the last few months.
[219:50.93]Maybe, like... I don't do it every day.
[219:56.28]Maybe, like, once every... I don't know, once every three, four days.
[219:58.92]Once every five days, so... Once a week, twice a week.
[220:02.42]But here's the thing.
[220:03.54]You do one packet over the course of, like, pretty much a whole day.
[220:13.40]Which ends up being about the equivalent of maybe two cups of coffee.
[220:19.70]But I like it a lot.
[220:20.88]I really do.
[220:27.00]No, no, no, no.
[220:30.94]Yeah, it's electrolytes too.
[220:32.02]Yeah.
[220:33.56]Essentially, it's kind of like a Gatorade with green tea powder and caffeine in it.
[220:43.56]So if I don't... Matcha powder, like green tea powder, is only like 30 milligrams.
[220:49.65]If I really need something, I'll drink one of these liquid IVs.
[220:52.23]Yeah, I'm talking about caffeine.
[221:01.46]Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[221:02.24]This stuff is... No, trust me, I wouldn't drink this if I didn't think it was any good.
[221:09.34]Is this an ad?
[221:10.04]No, no, I just actually drink these.
[221:17.25]Matcha's not that high in caffeine, isn't it?
[221:19.24]Green tea is 30 milligrams of caffeine.
[221:24.98]Some people drink a bunch of Monster a day.
[221:26.42]Yeah, I always try to stay... I know, I'm supposed to be leaving.
[221:28.88]I'm supposed to get out of here.
[221:30.48]But I really, realistically, real talk, I've tried to cut a lot of the coffee I drink a day.
[221:40.15]So I typically will replace coffee with one of these green tea drinks.
[221:48.04]And it's, yeah, you know, still has caffeine, but it's fine.
[221:57.27]And the company in general, too.
[221:58.67]I've, like, looked into the company, too.
[222:01.05]I think they're, at least what they claim, they try to be sustainable and stuff, so that's cool.
[222:13.19]Don't leave.
[222:16.82]How is this not an ad?
[222:18.66]I'm not being paid to tell you this.
[222:19.68]This is something that I literally do on a weekly basis.
[222:26.27]I mean, could it be an ad?
[222:27.29]Sure.
[222:27.65]I mean, I guess so.
[222:28.75]Have you ever had matcha ice cream?
[222:39.98]Oh, yeah.
[222:41.32]I became a green tea Andy over the last six months.
[222:43.80]I love it.
[222:49.48]You should email them.
[223:04.66]Thoughts on coffee ice cream?
[223:06.64]Okay, I gotta go.
[223:08.20]But, yeah.
[223:09.42]Sponsorships and advertisement type shit, you guys know that I'm... Evolved is working on that stuff.
[223:18.09]So, I don't know.
[223:19.39]That'd be kind of cool.
[223:23.43]I mean, I actually use it.
[223:28.31]Get a matcha sponsor.
[223:32.86]Nah, nah.
[223:33.36]Alright, BRB.
[223:33.86]I'll see you in a minute.
[223:41.46]Wait, somebody raided?
[223:42.20]What happened?
[223:43.76]Wait, wait, wait.
[223:44.38]Somebody actually raided.
[223:46.02]Who raided?
[223:47.20]I can't see it.
[223:53.00]This is a big raid?
[223:53.88]I can't even see who it is.
[223:55.16]Who is it?
[223:59.66]It's a big balls raid.
[224:01.79]Big balls?
[224:03.79]Big balls.
[224:05.71]Thanks a lot, big balls.
[224:06.49]I appreciate it.
[224:06.95]Is everybody coming over?
[224:12.15]Thanks for the raid.
[224:17.42]Hold on.
[224:17.68]Are you guys making this up?
[224:20.82]I saw a lot of like, big balls, big balls, and like, hey, we're here.
[224:23.54]I don't know.
[224:25.68]I don't understand.
[224:26.80]Hold on.
[224:28.12]Let me look at my dashboard.
[224:35.29]I got trolled.
[224:35.87]Yeah, I got trolled.
[224:36.55]Yeah, I seriously did.
[224:38.15]Yeah.
[224:39.01]That's okay.
[224:43.55]Yeah, there's no raid.
[224:44.45]Okay.
[224:44.87]Alright.
[224:45.11]I'll be right back.
[224:45.77]Bye.
[224:52.06]Thank you.
[226:10.82]you
[227:34.32]So,
[228:55.72]Thanks for watching!
[230:06.47]What's up?
[230:07.29]I'm back.
[230:07.55]How you doing?
[230:23.51]The big balls raid was real?
[230:26.19]Yeah.
[230:29.65]From Beta64.
[230:30.21]Oh, cool.
[230:31.01]Alright.
[230:33.41]So it was real.
[230:38.58]Well, thanks for doing it.
[230:40.59]Welcome, guys.
[230:52.31]You pissed on a raid?
[230:53.36]What?
[230:53.60]No, I didn't.
[230:54.48]I even asked and I looked.
[230:57.50]What are you talking about?
[231:07.20]You're so high, you keep laughing like Seth Rogen.
[231:17.83]Such a specific... I'm not even sure if it's an insult or not, but a specific comment.
[231:23.64]Okay, let's go.
[231:25.78]What else was it?
[231:26.24]What was the other one I downloaded?
[231:27.66]There's one more.
[231:29.98]What did I have queued up?
[231:38.72]Oh, the pirate game, right.
[231:44.72]Turn that off.
[231:47.56]Let's get it open.
[231:54.91]Very cool.
[231:59.91]This game is very bright.
[232:00.91]It's very colorful.
[232:02.73]Just wanted to warn you.
[232:13.00]Why is all this off?
[232:15.68]Oh, sorry.
[232:34.15]Okay, all this is turned off.
[232:35.63]I don't know why.
[232:38.55]You guys ready for the Pirate Bay?
[232:42.01]Pirate's Bay?
[232:44.60]Pirate's Bay.
[232:48.68]Let's go.
[232:52.56]New game.
[232:56.40]You can roll to avoid damage.
[233:02.69]Probably controller, right?
[233:04.49]Yeah.
[233:05.31]Control scheme, change to controller.
[233:06.45]Okay, that's jump.
[233:15.15]Crouch.
[233:16.65]Oh, F1.
[233:16.93]Uh, that's going to be different.
[233:22.67]Alright, that's dodge.
[233:23.71]Is this a dodge roll?
[233:25.11]Alright, dodge roll.
[233:29.23]Use, move, hide, change target, aim, attack.
[233:34.73]Oh shit.
[233:38.05]That's block?
[233:40.37]Alright, we'll figure it out.
[233:50.56]Talk.
[233:52.88]A, talk.
[233:55.10]Talk, A, A.
[233:58.90]A. Alright, what is it over here?
[234:00.49]E. What's up?
[234:01.77]I don't want to spend any money right now, no.
[234:08.87]Is there a sprint?
[234:12.16]Okay, just checking to see what happened.
[234:23.47]Am I holding my head underwater?
[234:30.18]How do I get back up?
[234:31.90]I just want to see if he died if he jumped in the water.
[234:33.99]Where do I go?
[234:37.91]Where do I go to get up from here?
[234:39.45]Alright, use ladder.
[234:53.72]There we go.
[234:54.50]Oh yeah, that was quick.
[234:57.46]Okay, so now what do I do?
[235:04.67]Put the sails up?
[235:08.32]Alright, let's move.
[235:08.84]Let's go for it.
[235:09.94]Can I steer?
[235:23.14]Let's go.
[235:24.70]Let's go!
[235:33.42]We're going to that island right there.
[235:38.21]Open your sails?
[235:38.99]Oh, shit.
[235:48.80]Alright, now let's go.
[235:53.46]Am I steering?
[236:00.99]How do you steer?
[236:07.92]Okay, we're gonna do keyboard.
[236:19.03]You only have one person on this whole crew?
[236:25.77]I would be freaking out if I saw this coming into the port.
[236:31.84]How do you- is there a break?
[236:35.91]Alright, how do you, um... So I made it to this town?
[236:40.03]How do I stop the boat from moving?
[236:46.50]I need to put the anchor out?
[236:47.38]Where's the anchor?
[237:08.24]There's no... There's no brake pedal, dude.
[237:11.74]Oh, drop anchor.
[237:12.30]Okay.
[237:37.48]I got it.
[237:43.66]Way anchor?
[237:44.44]Wait, okay.
[237:45.56]I gotta get closer.
[237:47.92]Why do I need a crew?
[237:49.27]I need... I can't just do this by myself.
[237:53.31]I need to take a cigar out of my mouth and be like, Alright, hoist the sails, baby!
[237:58.57]Why am I doing this by myself?
[238:01.03]Oh, fuck.
[238:01.43]We're getting in... We're coming in hot.
[238:11.52]Alright, stop.
[238:12.94]There we go.
[238:17.71]That's not going anywhere, right?
[238:19.99]No, we're good.
[238:36.20]This guy looks like he's waiting for me.
[238:39.40]What if I get... I want a weapon.
[238:44.35]Is this hostile territory?
[238:45.79]I have no idea.
[238:48.19]Is this a hostile territory for me?
[238:49.67]I don't think so.
[238:54.60]Oh, wait.
[238:55.18]What's up there?
[239:01.20]Okay.
[239:03.68]Oh, a pirate.
[239:04.40]Want to see my weapons and ammo for sale.
[239:07.50]Okay, you've got a saber, musket, blunderbuss.
[239:12.31]That's actually a lot of weapons.
[239:13.23]Alright, I need... I need like a thousand bucks.
[239:18.51]Thousand bucks.
[239:18.99]I think there's like a quest up here.
[239:28.44]Alright, what is that?
[239:29.10]See?
[239:29.30]20 meters?
[239:31.42]I'm going that way.
[239:34.64]Your boat is floating away.
[239:35.82]No, it's not.
[239:50.85]Do I need to kill this guy?
[239:54.51]Hello, traveler.
[239:55.01]Have you heard of the legends of the most terrifying pirates of these seas?
[239:59.25]I can tell you where to find them for a small fee.
[240:02.37]And if you beat them, your profit will be much larger.
[240:04.34]Okay.
[240:07.26]Where is the rogue admiral?
[240:12.80]Thank you.
[240:14.22]Let's go get him.
[240:18.08]Alright.
[240:18.86]Where's my...
[240:22.01]What?
[240:23.33]Alright, where's my... That's such a scam!
[240:27.97]Oh, there we go.
[240:29.09]No.
[240:29.61]Oh, there we go.
[240:30.10]Okay, over there.
[240:32.82]1,700 meters that way.
[240:40.84]Yeah, I spent all my money, but I'm gonna get... I'm gonna go here.
[240:43.35]I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna kill this guy.
[240:47.01]Get a bounty for it.
[240:50.58]I thought that was just rolling credits.
[240:52.36]I was like, we're getting credits already?
[240:54.96]Did I run out of time?
[241:03.22]That's not my boat right there, right?
[241:09.69]That's not my boat, right?
[241:12.09]No, that's my boat.
[241:16.85]Brawl demo timer.
[241:18.23]Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[241:23.87]What happened to the music?
[241:31.89]This thing's in sync, right?
[241:36.88]What's this game?
[241:37.40]The game is called Pirate Bay.
[241:40.54]Pirate's Bay.
[241:46.00]Part of the Steam demo week.
[241:51.50]Go check it out if you think it's cool.
[241:54.08]It's literally free.
[241:55.28]You don't have to do anything.
[241:57.48]Just install the game.
[241:58.62]Is it?
[241:58.82]Okay, let's go find this guy.
[242:01.14]1800 meters this way.
[242:11.54]Alright, full speed ahead.
[242:54.55]I just... I... Somebody just talked about my beard.
[242:57.36]They don't like it.
[243:01.24]They don't like it.
[243:11.55]Well, I'm shaving today, so... Alright, let's do it.
[243:19.06]Let's get him!
[243:21.62]I don't have any weapons.
[243:29.70]How am I gonna fight this guy?
[243:42.89]He's on this island.
[243:46.66]I'll just beat his ass, it's fine.
[244:05.81]Stop overcorrecting.
[244:07.91]I've never driven a sail, a boat, like, a ship like this before.
[244:14.14]Sorry, I'm overdoing it.
[244:17.80]Yeah, there's rain, too.
[244:18.40]There's weather.
[244:18.80]Okay.
[244:26.85]I'm gonna... Here's my approach.
[244:33.05]Put down the anchor.
[244:39.04]There's a campfire right there.
[244:42.98]He's definitely right there.
[244:43.88]Oh, shit.
[244:50.19]It's a crewmate.
[244:55.41]I have no stamina.
[245:12.49]Can I take this guy's shit?
[245:26.29]Alright, give me your sword.
[245:27.99]Can I loot him?
[245:30.58]No, I can't.
[245:31.16]Okay.
[245:32.56]Look, this guy's naked.
[245:33.72]This guy's naked.
[245:35.90]Wait, why is there a naked skeleton?
[245:37.92]Wait, what's going on?
[245:43.97]The other skeleton, the other guy had clothes on.
[245:45.41]Wait, chest.
[245:47.66]Chest or chest, right here.
[245:49.80]Come on, give me a weapon.
[245:50.50]Give me a sword, something.
[245:52.24]A thousand bucks.
[245:54.84]Get the fuck out of here.
[245:55.72]Leave me alone.
[246:15.35]Where the fuck are you running to?
[246:21.90]He's got so much health.
[246:22.74]He's got way too much health.
[246:23.56]I'm gonna drown him.
[246:29.37]Oh, the skeleton's gonna fight him?
[246:30.21]I have an idea.
[246:47.16]Did they not go in the water?
[246:53.01]I'm trying to drag him by his feet.
[246:54.73]I'm going to run him over.
[247:01.53]I'm going to run his ass over.
[247:05.95]Look how many people he has.
[247:07.01]This is ridiculous.
[247:28.25]Hit X to pull a weapon out?
[247:29.39]No, I don't have any weapons.
[247:36.44]No, I don't... Wait, what?
[247:40.30]Was that actually a sword that I have in my inventory?
[247:43.78]Let's go.
[247:44.30]Come on.
[247:44.72]Where is it?
[247:47.24]Don't even... Alright, I'm dead.
[247:48.54]I died.
[247:55.17]Where do I spawn?
[247:58.00]Am I still on the island?
[248:04.70]I do have... I have a sword.
[248:05.68]How do I take it out?
[248:06.22]Alright, let's go.
[248:09.70]I think I'm on the same... I think I'm on the island still.
[248:17.38]Is there a map?
[248:25.51]Yep, I'm still on the island.
[248:29.70]Alright, this guy's dead.
[248:38.42]Is that a foam Minecraft sword or what?
[248:41.26]Am I gonna be able to fight him?
[249:01.72]He killed me again.
[249:05.53]It's made out of aluminum foil.
[249:09.45]Well, I'll kill him eventually.
[249:10.49]I get to keep going back.
[249:18.20]I'll just... Okay, there's a spoiler for a very popular Marvel movie that I'm about to spoil.
[249:22.56]There's a doctor in it.
[249:26.95]It's a... It's a movie about a doctor.
[249:30.35]And he's weird.
[249:32.17]Okay?
[249:37.05]I can just... I can just Dormammu this guy, right?
[249:39.95]Like, it doesn't matter.
[249:40.61]I'll come back over and over again.
[249:47.96]Oh no, I'm dead!
[249:48.82]I'm not Morbius!
[249:53.76]Dormammu!
[249:55.30]I'm here to bargain!
[250:20.01]Dormammu!
[250:22.35]I'm here to bargain.
[250:24.06]Dormammu!
[250:31.06]R1 him?
[250:31.74]R1?
[250:32.28]R1?
[250:33.25]Stop it, please.
[250:33.89]I got him!
[250:34.33]I win!
[250:34.61]I win!
[250:34.85]I got 10,000 fucking dollars!
[250:37.05]Who cares if I lost 600?
[250:38.01]Are you kidding me?
[250:49.09]Alright, get out, get out, get out.
[250:49.89]What if I lose a percentage?
[250:51.04]It's probably 20%.
[250:51.48]Yeah, fuck all these Dormammus.
[250:55.70]I don't care.
[250:56.06]I'm out.
[250:56.32]Is this my boat?
[250:59.35]Is that my boat?
[251:01.11]It's not.
[251:02.15]Well, it is now.
[251:18.65]Never mind.
[251:20.99]Where's my boat?
[251:22.41]Is my boat gone?
[251:28.01]I don't see it anywhere.
[251:34.27]I think it's actually gone.
[251:38.21]No, that's not it.
[251:38.79]Wait, no, it's over here.
[251:40.25]It's on the map.
[251:51.43]There it is.
[251:51.79]I wonder if he had any items.
[251:56.44]There's probably stuff here to take, right?
[252:02.32]Maybe not.
[252:02.96]Okay.
[252:04.38]Well, I can buy a gun now.
[252:07.60]I at least need to see what the gun is like.
[252:16.63]I'd rather watch you eat a jar of mayonnaise...
[252:20.39]You'd probably rather watch me eat a jar of mayonnaise than a lot of stuff.
[252:33.13]I don't think it matters what we're doing.
[252:34.99]I think that you would probably put that higher on the list.
[252:40.57]Because that's weird and crazy and you don't want to miss that stream.
[252:53.38]Alright.
[252:54.62]I need to get back to... Where do I need to go?
[252:59.10]Alright, that was fun.
[253:02.16]That was called Pirate's Bay.
[253:04.16]That was cool.
[253:04.64]It's like a single-player pirate adventure game.
[253:08.06]Pretty sick.
[253:09.66]Pretty sick.
[253:14.70]What else we got?
[253:17.10]What's the one that everybody keeps... I keep seeing it in chat.
[253:22.32]I keep seeing people saying this one, this one, this one.
[253:23.76]There's something with an X in it.
[253:25.88]Slayer's X. Is that on here?
[253:32.43]What category?
[253:40.83]Is it action, adventure, simulation, RPG?
[253:43.15]What is it?
[253:53.64]Platformer?
[253:57.88]I guess I can just type it in.
[254:00.75]Slayers X. Is this Shooter?
[254:21.98]Okay.
[254:24.32]No, I'm not going to play this Succubus game.
[254:25.64]Why would I do that?
[254:42.61]Wait, what the fuck?
[254:48.81]Don't tell me I'm having problems again with this.
[254:58.16]Why can't I download it?
[255:04.56]Hold on, let me try another one.
[255:19.33]Maintenance?
[255:20.05]No, it's not.
[255:21.97]They did maintenance yesterday.
[255:22.89]It's not going to happen again.
[255:26.62]What was the other one?
[255:27.98]What, Celico?
[255:28.68]Let me try that one.
[255:40.84]What the fuck?
[255:43.34]What is all this about?
[255:44.14]This is weird.
[256:02.99]I can't download anything.
[256:06.74]My Steam is, like, fucked up.
[256:16.00]Huh.
[256:17.64]Well, um... I guess I can open up the DreadX thing again.
[256:23.17]That's weird.
[256:31.29]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[256:38.02]No, I can't download anything on Steam.
[256:40.50]Oh, wait.
[256:40.94]Yeah, I can.
[256:41.90]It just popped back up.
[256:44.78]I think.
[256:46.00]Is this actually working?
[256:52.47]Dude, your chin is huge.
[257:00.79]Yeah, and guess what?
[257:01.49]If I get in a fucking street fight, I just... It's like a bird beak hitting you right in the fucking mouth.
[257:16.44]No, never mind.
[257:17.04]I think Steam's fucked up.
[257:19.50]It looked like I could download it, but I can't.
[257:22.76]Um... I can open DreadX.
[257:25.68]Play a couple more of those.
[257:27.70]I was not fair to the DreadX stuff before because of all the internet problems and I was annoyed and pissed off.
[257:32.00]So we can try some of the DreadX stuff.
[257:35.81]That's sad because I... This is like over soon.
[257:38.21]Alright.
[257:38.55]Well, whatever.
[257:43.47]You're the comedy relief character that gets killed off.
[257:45.71]Yeah.
[257:47.34]Although, they kind of keep the comedy relief character around long enough to make jokes for the movie.
[257:52.98]So I'd last a little while, I think.
[258:00.85]I think I'd last a little while.
[258:06.99]Please do some of this stuff for green screen.
[258:10.43]Alright, I'll do the go away, go away thing.
[258:15.42]Are you guys going to have me get attacked by a bear?
[258:28.78]Alright.
[258:30.68]Let's go play this other thing over here.
[258:33.36]That was creepy.
[258:33.86]I like that one.
[258:36.80]They were all pretty good.
[258:39.78]DreadX.
[258:40.36]I love this.
[258:41.58]I love these little micro-games.
[258:44.23]The demo stuff I love because it's like only 20, 30, 40 minutes an hour.
[258:48.01]It's perfect.
[258:49.55]Try to be Demo Andy for the rest of my life.
[258:55.44]Okay.
[258:57.52]Let's get out of here.
[259:01.24]What's the one that I have downloaded?
[259:02.17]Is that Cell?
[259:05.09]Cellico.
[259:08.63]Let's see if it's any good.
[259:12.64]much longer are you gonna stream probably not that much longer and I really I'm gonna disappoint a lot of people here uh um unfortunately I have a lot of stuff to do this weekend and into this week I told you I was gonna be kind of erratic with the stream schedule you're not gonna see me for a little while you're not gonna see me for like five or six days or something
[259:36.48]That's why I was so pissed off yesterday because I wanted to stream yesterday because I knew I wanted to do two days in a row because I knew I wasn't going to be around.
[259:43.21]That's why I was so mad yesterday afternoon.
[259:46.51]And I know my voice is junk.
[259:47.67]I know I'm very aware of it.
[259:50.19]Let's do this though.
[259:50.65]Let's play this.
[259:54.20]Celico.
[259:58.74]Hopefully it's not too loud.
[260:03.53]Disappointed?
[260:04.05]What do you mean?
[260:04.45]Um, I don't know.
[260:06.09]I just... I'm really trying to do more than a couple times a week.
[260:14.88]What is... This is a little... Let me see.
[260:18.56]Okay, so here it is.
[260:21.12]Welcome to the Steam Next Fest demo.
[260:25.65]Very fair.
[260:26.17]Oh, it had a different name, okay.
[260:54.74]Game's unfinished.
[260:56.59]The demo has been significantly altered.
[260:59.05]And that's it.
[261:00.41]Okay.
[261:01.37]It's a work in progress.
[261:02.79]Yeah.
[261:03.17]Okay.
[261:04.83]I get it.
[261:05.07]I have a state-of-the-art gaming PC.
[261:07.83]$30.90.
[261:07.85]Oh, I thought the game crashed.
[261:23.89]This is Celico.
[261:30.85]Press any key.
[261:40.15]Friendly reminder that you have previously set one or more graphics to ridiculous.
[261:45.00]Please be aware that this setting is not optimized for any computer and may cause performance and visibility issues.
[261:56.84]So maybe I should change it.
[262:02.04]I'll go ahead and change it.
[262:09.00]What is streamer mode?
[262:25.03]Really?
[262:25.23]Really?
[262:30.12]wow reduce screen shake that's a plus one for me avoid compression issues they thought that that's a lot of thought that went into that that's cool uh I'm gonna have to put okay yeah let's do this let's put this on just high where's ridiculous okay
[262:54.12]Real time ground ceiling reflections.
[262:56.94]Mirror reflections.
[262:57.90]That's cool.
[262:59.88]Alright, decal quality.
[263:01.50]High level of detail.
[263:04.44]Ultra.
[263:05.18]I think that's fine.
[263:08.79]It told me not to do this because it's literally impossible for a computer.
[263:14.87]Sound I think is in a good spot.
[263:20.65]Dude, I got it.
[263:21.19]Okay, let's give a round of applause.
[263:28.40]having a shitload of options even if nobody touches it is such a huge deal because they might be something that you really don't like in a game that you can never take out but when you have the option to take something out it it's just better don't applaud it yet you didn't try it hold on look at all this stuff
[263:55.61]Let's see some gameplay.
[263:56.45]Alright, let's see some gameplay.

[263:59.01]Fine.
[264:00.43]Okay.
[264:18.28]Shouldn't these be the same?
[264:28.02]Shouldn't these be the same?
[264:29.56]Horizontal and vertical?
[264:31.26]Not in this game.
[264:32.28]Really?
[264:32.54]Huh?
[264:37.10]Okay.
[264:40.23]Alright, let's go.

[264:48.25]Alright, here we go.
[264:51.75]Just play the game.
[264:52.43]I'm just making sure I get it in the right spot.
[264:56.26]Choose your playstyle.
[264:58.20]We'll just do traditional.
[265:00.74]Rifle?
[265:01.18]Start each level with only an assault rifle.
[265:02.72]Nah.
[265:07.84]There's glowing eyes behind you.
[265:14.06]Steam demo for Celica provides an early look at the game.
[265:15.82]While it's still in development, most story elements will be absent until a later demo update.
[265:21.07]When's the game actually come out?
[265:21.87]Is there a date?
[265:39.26]Grab teddy bear.

[268:09.74]Alright, stand back!
[268:11.08]It's gonna get loud!
[268:29.33]Whoa, that animation is cool.
[268:40.62]The reload animation, it's like the FPS is different, is low.
[268:44.28]It's weird.
[268:45.42]I like it.
[268:46.10]I like the reload animation.
[268:50.35]All the animations are interesting.
[269:06.01]It feels like, um... I'm on just the normal difficulty.
[269:11.45]It feels like, um... Like, Doom.
[269:15.17]But... It's like a 3D, much cleaner and better looking... Ah, it's weird.
[269:19.65]Hard to describe.
[269:22.50]Ah, there's the key.
[269:30.08]This was... Oh, this was a DOOM mod!
[269:31.60]That's right!

[273:09.43]Can this help me?
[273:13.78]Eat a Whopper?
[273:14.64]No.
[273:14.90]I'm not into that right now.
[273:25.01]I'm going backwards a lot.
[273:32.24]That's a long slide.
[273:40.89]Challenges?
[273:41.47]Okay.
[273:46.49]Cool.
[274:02.65]Armor lost?
[274:03.33]Uh oh.
[274:03.65]Alright, this game gets like a 5 out of 5 for style.
[274:21.22]And I mean like a 1 for gameplay because like how would I have died there?
[274:24.38]It's impossible.
[274:30.82]I'm kidding I'm kidding it's cool uh this is absolutely fun I love the 2D 3D it's so weird this reminds me of one time I was on Family Guy what
[275:06.68]Jeez, alright, slow down, slow down, s-s-s-s-s-s-s-
[275:31.66]You made my paper shredder overheat.
[275:33.38]Why?
[275:34.04]I didn't overload your paper shredder.
[275:36.88]You do up to six sheets at a time.
[275:41.34]Don't be dumb and do more than six sheets.
[275:45.39]That's a thing that you did.
[275:50.07]And I know, you did like seven or eight sheets.
[275:52.39]You said, I don't feel like sitting here and doing six at a time.
[275:55.79]Fuck it.
[275:57.65]And it went and then you look like a fool.
[276:08.52]I mean, it was foolish what you did.
[276:27.03]Unlock.
[276:27.37]Ooh.
[276:32.70]Ah!
[277:02.14]Lockdown active.
[277:03.84]Where should I go from here?
[277:14.60]Somebody's shooting at me from here.
[277:25.41]This is absolutely fucking insane to do GZ Doom?
[277:31.38]What's Jeezy Doom?
[277:41.89]It's just the DOOM engine.
[277:45.90]Now, wait, wait, wait.
[277:46.32]Are we talking the original Doom?
[277:48.68]Just Doom 1?
[277:50.24]Just Doom?
[277:52.06]For the Amiga?
[277:55.22]What?! !
[278:04.49]That doesn't make any sense.
[278:08.87]That doesn't make any sense.
[278:09.79]How does that make any sense?
[278:15.31]That's crazy.
[278:15.95]Can I get in here?
[278:25.62]I can go in there.
[278:26.30]Hold on.
[278:26.52]What about over here?
[278:27.80]I did this.
[278:28.28]I did that.
[278:30.30]I'm missing a door or something.
[278:34.11]Well, that's remarkable.
[278:37.51]That's really, really cool.
[278:38.45]Where's this door?
[278:41.23]I know I'm lost.
[278:41.81]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[278:46.31]A key or something?
[278:47.05]Do I need to open it with something?
[278:48.25]Wow, where do I go?
[278:50.32]There's a light behind you?
[278:51.58]Yeah, I know.
[278:52.16]It's called a lamp.
[278:54.96]Well, he's only... This place is in lockdown.
[278:58.84]Wait.
[279:01.70]That doesn't mean anything.
[279:02.40]No, I'm fine.
[279:03.10]What?
[279:12.79]Oh, got it.
[279:13.19]I thought I was just looking for a door.
[279:21.39]That makes a lot more sense now that I'm playing this.
[279:24.74]That this is Doom.
[279:26.00]That they just have heavily changed.
[279:59.07]Happy birthday.
[280:01.78]Wait, that's... Who's that?
[280:07.22]That's me!
[280:32.68]Jesus Whoa, wait, what?
[280:59.37]Oh
[281:01.53]Dude, you should play Frog Monster.
[281:02.75]I already did!
[281:03.21]That game is sick.
[281:04.09]Alright, where should I go from here?
[281:21.29]Oh my goodness!
[281:23.75]I can't tell if that was a bad or a good idea.
[281:25.09]I think it was a good idea.
[281:31.22]What?
[281:32.48]Where am I?
[281:32.98]W... Do I have a flashlight?
[281:39.04]Oh my god, I'm gonna drown.
[282:07.08]Wait, wasn't I up here already?
[282:07.94]No, I wasn't.
[282:09.10]I do have a flashlight.
[282:09.92]Alright, good.
[282:28.20]Come get me.
[282:30.84]Security level three
[283:01.55]camera feeds?
[283:02.27]There's a lot going on in this game.
[283:09.76]There's a lot going on.
[283:13.76]That was just a Roomba, but I don't care.
[283:17.56]It was on the enemy team.
[283:53.71]Crap!
[283:58.33]Use Z for a medkit?
[283:59.57]Oh my god, I'm dumb.
[284:04.30]Is there a map?
[284:04.78]I actually don't know.
[284:05.40]There might be.
[284:11.50]Your room is really dumb.
[284:12.20]Yeah, because I was playing scary games earlier and here we are.
[284:17.48]Alright, one more attempt and that's it.
[284:18.96]Then I'm going to call it.
[284:21.98]I just, I need a cheeseburger so bad.
[284:24.16]It's like the only thing I care about right now.
[284:26.32]It's the number one thing I care about.
[284:27.62]Perfect timing.
[284:42.59]I'm exhausted.
[284:44.29]Hopefully get some rest.
[284:45.97]Rest up.
[284:52.66]Yeah, get some rest.
[284:54.94]Why not?
[285:02.83]Those guys hurt a lot.
[285:03.69]Oh!
[285:23.67]Oh god, I didn't know you were still here!
[285:25.41]Alright, sorry, sorry.
[285:27.43]I gotta go get some meat in me.
[285:29.63]I gotta get some beef with the lettuce.
[285:35.36]What's my special order?
[285:43.32]What's my special order?
[285:49.71]Why am I still moving around?
[285:55.97]Lettuce.
[285:57.65]No.
[285:58.14]Jalapeños.
[286:01.32]Grilled onions.
[286:03.42]A1 steak sauce.
[286:05.64]Fucking... And that's it.
[286:12.47]Cheese.
[286:13.41]Grilled onions.
[286:14.45]Jalapeños.
[286:15.27]A1 steak sauce.
[286:17.59]Let's get it.
[286:18.95]I just like how I think of this word cross-eyed.
[286:22.65]Oh, an A1 steak sauce.
[286:24.37]Let's get it.
[286:27.59]I guess I'm fucking tired.
[286:31.31]Guys, I only put A1 steak sauce on a cheeseburger.
[286:35.41]That's it.
[286:36.63]It never goes on anything else.
[286:41.56]I've never had A1 on anything besides a burger sometimes when I order a burger.
[286:45.40]They should just rename it A1 Burger Sauce because that's where it belongs.
[286:58.58]I don't put it on everything.
[286:59.70]I don't put it on everything.
[287:01.34]No, that'd be gross.
[287:04.65]Alright, that's going to conclude the stream.
[287:06.17]And I will see you guys later.
[287:10.89]Celico, that was really cool.
[287:13.79]The fact that that's done in a DOOM mod seems impossible.
[287:19.03]And that's what makes it so cool.
[287:23.11]A lot of fun games today.
[287:24.45]I like this.
[287:25.93]Even if it goes away, I might still do it.
[287:30.92]So the next time you guys are going to see me, let me see.
[287:32.86]Let me check here.
[287:37.93]It's probably going to be... There's a lot going on.
[287:43.80]I'll be back in a week.
[287:47.31]I want to stream.
[287:47.99]I really want to.
[287:48.89]I don't want to just leave.
[287:50.61]And just, like, not stream for, like, a week.
[287:53.23]But probably the 23rd or the 24th.
[287:56.43]And then, after that, I can promise you that I will be back.
[288:00.89]No more seven-day breaks.
[288:06.02]So, trust me, I want to be hanging out.
[288:16.71]But there's a lot of cool stuff that's going to be happening soon.
[288:21.83]Stuff that I'm very excited for.
[288:33.82]Is there any IRL stuff?
[288:34.86]Yes, there is.
[288:36.90]I've got some IRL stuff that I need to take care of, as well as a ton of stream stuff.
[288:43.58]Baseball is in kind of crunch time right now.
[288:47.13]But I'm going to have so much fun with that.
[288:49.17]That's going to be some of the... Ugh, I can't wait.
[288:51.87]I've been waiting like two years to do that.
[288:55.74]But everything's good.
[288:56.44]Everything's fine.
[289:00.96]Don't worry.
[289:03.10]When I say IRL stuff, it's not... Everything's fine.
[289:06.00]Don't worry.
[289:10.04]There's just a ton of things I have to get done.
[289:27.34]The baseball stream is going to be the first sports event I'm actually going to watch.
[289:33.72]It's going to be interesting.
[289:34.92]I will promise you that it'll be interesting.
[289:43.44]Yeah, I'll see you guys in a week.
[289:44.62]Don't forget about me.
[289:45.60]I'll be back, I promise.
[289:53.25]Thanks for watching.
[289:53.83]Thanks for the subs.
[289:54.73]Thanks for the raid.
[289:55.23]There was a couple of raids today, right?
[289:58.93]Or hosts.
[290:03.13]It's late.
[290:04.37]Pretty much anywhere around the world right now.
[290:07.86]Get some sleep.
[290:09.14]Take care of yourselves.
[290:10.88]Call your mother.
[290:11.30]You know, the usual.
[290:18.44]Have a great night, guys.
[290:19.23]See you soon.
[290:27.16]Oh, and by the way, when I stream again, I'm going to have a ton of dates for you guys to mark down.
[290:34.02]Green screen will have one.
[290:35.24]Baseball is locked in for the 20th, by the way.
[290:37.24]I want to make sure I make that clear.
[290:38.90]July 20th.
[290:41.06]It's not July 14th anymore.
[290:42.34]We had to do a bunch of stuff with the venue.
[290:44.88]So that's July 20th.
[290:46.98]It had to move about six days later.
[290:52.67]I might even actually be able to announce the other project.
[290:57.03]Which that would be exciting too.
[291:03.83]I would love to be able to announce the other project.
[291:05.83]I feel like it's going to be a lot of fun.
[291:10.15]But goodnight guys.
[291:10.71]See you soon.
[291:11.30]Have a good week.
[291:13.64]I'll be back.
[291:15.98]Take care.
[291:17.14]Goodbye.
[291:45.17]Thank you.
[292:20.07]you
