[ve:60.16.100]

[00:04.61]I know.
[00:05.07]I know.
[00:05.73]I've seen it spam in the chat.
[00:07.75]Listen, I know.
[00:08.32]I... I had to take a few important phone calls and they happened at exactly 12 o'clock and then at 12.30.
[00:18.06]So I'm sorry.
[00:19.13]I'm very nervous because you heard the voice crack.
[00:21.03]Uh...
[00:25.42]It's not four.
[00:26.66]It's not three.
[00:27.86]It's one.
[00:29.25]That's pretty good.
[00:30.41]That's pretty good.
[00:31.27]That means I can stream for at least five to six hours without running into 7.30 PM internet turnoff issue.
[00:41.39]That's pretty good.
[00:42.73]I did say that like between 12 and one, I did say one.
[00:46.47]So I'm even late to being one.
[00:49.54]But whoa, what's going on?
[00:56.45]Why is my Twitch dashboard saying that the stream is like dead?
[01:01.17]Is everything okay?
[01:09.62]My Twitch dashboard has a bright red thing that is telling me that this is not good.
[01:15.92]That's weird.
[01:17.76]Why is it showing me that?
[01:20.48]Okay, well, whatever.
[01:23.77]We're going to play some Sims 4 again today.
[01:25.91]Same character, same world that we're in.
[01:29.64]The only difference today is I did install.
[01:32.76]I want to say about maybe seven or eight mods.
[01:36.08]Some of them were wacky, but I'm going to use them sparingly.
[01:41.50]I'm just going to make this really clear that everybody that thinks that I'm going to be hanging out in the house and the person in the house is going to tell a bad joke and I'm going to literally run them over with a car, I'm not going to do that.
[01:56.78]We're going to use these very sparingly.
[02:05.14]All like the cartoon Tom and Jerry, you know, hit somebody in the head with a mallet kind of shit.
[02:11.57]We're not doing that unless it's going to be very sparingly.
[02:17.97]I can't start late.
[02:18.91]I have to start on time.
[02:20.60]I did.
[02:25.40]Just do it your way.
[02:26.66]Alright.
[02:30.50]No, I didn't get any of those mods.
[02:32.18]What do you think?
[02:36.29]For all the people that have been kind of bringing it up over the last 12 to 15 hours or so, I can't do those mods.
[02:44.95]They're not allowed.
[02:45.88]They are not allowed on Twitch.
[02:50.04]They're not allowed.
[02:50.94]Yeah, if you're a coward.
[02:58.70]I don't know if I'd like to keep my channel active.
[03:05.53]Well, I'm gonna get banned from Twitch, an indefinite ban from Twitch, and then write a tweet being like, yeah, at least I wasn't a coward.
[03:14.49]What?
[03:14.77]What?
[03:15.97]No.
[03:22.01]Oh, people ask, yeah, I want to mention this too.
[03:23.35]People asking about the VIP changes.
[03:25.59]So I, I completely removed VIP as a role.
[03:29.65]I just, I just dropped it.
[03:31.12]There's only one VIP on this whole channel anymore.
[03:37.83]And it's my girlfriend.
[03:38.67]So, VIP is gone.
[03:43.39]I just got rid of it.
[03:44.83]I thought, maybe, oh, would I give it to, like, other streamers or game devs?
[03:47.74]No, just the whole thing's gone.
[03:49.20]Just the whole thing.
[03:50.02]Get rid of it.
[03:56.76]Nepotism.
[04:04.25]Good afternoon, Mr. 985.
[04:05.53]Hey, good afternoon.
[04:10.55]No, honestly, the whole role is just going away.
[04:14.77]VIP, I didn't want it to turn into this, but it kind of turned into sort of a commodity over the years.
[04:20.55]Started to get some pretty real value behind it, which I really don't like.
[04:26.06]So I just decided to remove it.
[04:34.74]It's just gone.
[04:37.86]Will you be quiet today?
[04:42.12]No.
[04:48.51]Let me be quiet.
[04:53.29]Those of you that don't know, I thought about adding new VIPs a while back.
[04:59.39]And it can get a little awkward when people can essentially kind of bring up, hey, why did I not get VIP?
[05:08.68]Why did they get VIP?
[05:11.85]Who deserves VIP?
[05:13.07]What do they do?
[05:14.11]And it's almost like you have to start to prove that somebody deserves VIP for some reason.
[05:21.56]And I just don't want to do that.
[05:23.16]I'm just not going to do that.
[05:25.64]So nobody gets VIP anymore.
[05:33.60]Oh, there's one person that gets to be whatever that word.
[05:37.77]It's me.
[05:41.62]I was just like, passed out after saying it loud.
[05:44.08]I'm kidding, I'm relaxed.
[05:47.36]You know, I thought about VIPing Ballfondler.
[05:49.41]I thought about it.
[05:50.29]I thought about him being the only one.
[06:00.16]And then just mute everybody and just let him talk for five minutes.
[06:03.26]And then permanently ban him forever.
[06:13.96]Pauly just said, you don't have to give me VIP.
[06:17.18]Well, I did it for my own reason.
[06:25.09]That's pretty fair.
[06:26.11]That's really powerful.
[06:27.43]Don't do that.
[06:28.06]Do it.
[06:29.36]I'm not going to do that.
[06:36.63]But yeah, as we continue to go here, I don't think, VIP kind of is just not something I really want on the channel anymore.
[06:47.02]Call me a weirdo if you want, but that's just the way it is.
[06:50.26]I don't like having to pick and choose people and then have people potentially, I'm not saying this has happened, but potentially get angry or annoyed.
[06:59.44]And then I have to come up with a bunch of reasons why somebody did or didn't get it.
[07:05.84]Isn't Ballfondler banned?
[07:08.36]Oh.
[07:14.34]Oh, never mind.
[07:16.02]Change your pinned tweet.
[07:18.85]I will, eventually.
[07:19.79]Oh, no, no, he's unbanned.
[07:23.53]He got unbanned during baseball.
[07:24.93]Hasn't been re-banned yet.
[07:26.11]Okay, well, you be careful then.
[07:34.19]What are your thoughts on chemistry?
[07:35.35]I don't know.
[07:36.51]I think it's important.
[07:41.74]It helps us kind of understand our world better.
[07:44.64]Helps us kind of understand how the, you know, things react.
[07:53.61]It helps us understand our world.
[07:58.49]Okay, are you guys ready to play The Sims 4?
[08:00.93]And again, I'm not just going, people are not, I'm telling you right now, people are just going to be spamming it.
[08:04.86]And I'm telling you, mods, take care of this.
[08:07.76]I don't want to see, you know, like, kill them, attack him, attack him, punch him.
[08:13.60]No, we're playing The Sims 4 and I'm going to be a, one of the mods is actually kind of funny.
[08:18.18]I don't want to spoil it.
[08:22.64]Sparingly.
[08:23.26]Alright, you guys ready?
[08:28.11]Can you guys even see it?
[08:28.94]No, I haven't.
[08:29.30]Okay.
[08:31.30]I don't know how much, what is it?
[08:34.04]Autonomy, right?
[08:34.66]I don't know how much autonomy these mods have.
[08:36.40]So I'm going to make sure I have a save point in case somebody just gets hit by a car.
[08:40.69]Like in the first five minutes.
[08:42.89]Also, I did some exercises.
[08:45.05]I did some very light stretching and breathing exercises for the last, it's why I was late for another 10 minutes.
[08:50.43]Because if I laugh really hard, I'm going to get hurt.
[08:52.60]So I need to be ready.
[08:53.88]I have to be aware of this.
[08:58.71]Okay.
[09:00.47]Are you ready?
[09:00.85]We're still in... We're in... Oh, I think we're in Batuu still.
[09:03.95]I think.
[09:10.33]Can you guys hear it?
[09:13.59]How do I get out of here?
[09:17.85]This is a weird angle.
[09:18.77]This is a normal angle.
[09:21.19]This is a normal angle.
[09:24.17]I'm just chest up in frame.
[09:27.92]On a webcam.
[09:30.49]I want you to explain how this is weird.
[09:32.43]I need to know why this is weird.
[09:35.41]It's chest up, angled webcam.
[09:41.37]This is a scripted angle.
[09:43.59]You're inside out.
[09:46.73]YouTuber Andy.
[09:52.43]I am a YouTuber!
[09:53.51]I was a YouTuber for six years!
[09:58.12]The door should be on the other side.
[10:01.62]What?
[10:05.40]We've got architects in here now?
[10:08.38]This is an iPad zoom angle.
[10:11.60]Alright.
[10:13.22]Let's go.
[10:20.45]Okay, so there is autonomy because this is a Fortnite dance.
[10:31.44]Okay.
[10:32.46]Um, we need to, let's leave.
[10:34.72]We should get out of here.
[10:37.41]Is it, why am I getting a skill?
[10:44.17]All that's missing is like a bone on a tripod facing this way.
[10:52.67]Where's Santa?
[10:56.44]There are no game sounds?
[10:58.50]There should be.
[11:00.00]Can you not hear anything?
[11:01.52]Oh, I had him off.
[11:02.50]It's really weird without any music here.
[11:05.98]This is what I've been hearing.
[11:12.17]Guy's in his own world.
[11:13.01]Okay.
[11:28.95]You have a suedo green screen background!
[11:31.55]Alright, I'm done with this area.
[11:40.00]Can I go home now?
[11:40.82]Uh-oh.
[11:45.68]I hope I didn't break anything with the mods.
[11:50.19]Dance skill acquired.
[11:51.27]Blorg is busting some moves.
[11:52.53]He has unlocked some new dance moves.
[11:54.67]It can show off the arm charm dance move on the dance floor.

[13:00.40]I told you this is why I can't... We have to go home.
[13:05.88]Right now.
[13:07.95]It's quiet?
[13:10.13]The second that I see somebody start doing a Fortnite dance, it's like it's over.
[13:13.43]I can't just play The Sims now.
[13:14.61]I knew this was going to happen.
[13:18.07]How do I get out of here?
[13:20.39]I want to get out of the vacation.
[13:30.32]Does anyone know how to leave?

[18:10.24]Like just cook, right?
[18:12.40]Let's make, oh, I learned how to make this.
[18:15.44]Alright, let's make a single serving of this.
[18:19.48]That sounds good.
[18:26.41]Why are you coming over?
[18:32.89]What?
[18:38.01]And he's got worms?
[18:42.78]What's happening?
[18:45.13]Oh, it's because the stupid cube is up here.
[18:49.06]Okay.
[18:49.24]Alright, that's better.
[18:59.64]Resume.
[19:04.99]Turn the volume up?
[19:06.13]How does it turn down?
[19:07.13]That's what I have to ask.
[19:10.61]How did the volume get turned down so much?
[19:18.15]Alright, so I need three cooking skill.
[19:20.46]I can do that.
[19:24.34]A little too much powder.
[19:25.34]A little too much.
[19:27.50]How many gallons of milk do you think you could chug?
[19:29.17]I wouldn't do that.
[19:29.67]That's kind of fucking awful for you.
[19:31.23]It's really bad for you.
[19:34.35]Alright.
[19:42.98]There's more than on the counter?
[19:44.28]Oh, okay.
[19:45.84]Alright.
[19:46.16]Very good.
[19:47.76]Looks good.
[19:48.28]Looks pretty tasty.
[19:51.17]I'm not clicking that.
[19:58.61]It's too early.
[19:59.29]It's been 10 minutes.
[20:01.05]I'm not poisoning.
[20:02.03]Why would I poison the food I'm about to eat?
[20:11.42]I need to save this before something happens.
[20:16.52]Twerk.
[20:21.68]What's the crabby?
[20:22.60]Okay, can I, I'm gonna, he's now really confident, alright.
[20:34.37]Uh, I'm gonna accidentally poison this because it's right above put away.
[20:43.58]I'm gonna click put away, but my brain's gonna click poison, and it's gonna be bad.
[20:47.80]Okay, I need to cook again.
[20:55.07]Should I bake?
[20:57.53]That's a different thing, right?
[20:58.35]Alright, how about a hamburger cake?
[21:02.85]That's stupid.
[21:19.38]What was that?
[21:20.48]I didn't click.
[21:26.41]What are you doing?
[21:28.11]What is he doing?
[21:29.39]What is he doing?
[21:35.58]Okay.
[21:38.30]Freestyle?
[21:41.12]That was fun.
[21:41.80]Okay.
[21:58.93]I don't understand that.
[22:00.03]I don't know why they even programmed that in.
[22:01.41]Why did they program that into the game?
[22:03.76]I want you to ask yourself the question.
[22:05.62]What was it last time?
[22:07.28]Stop!
[22:07.78]Fucking make the food!
[22:25.79]When was the last time you guys went... An inch... Did you put it in a pan?
[22:30.85]When was the last time you guys went a half inch away from a food you were cooking and went... No.
[22:38.09]This is... It happens way too often.
[22:40.51]It happens way, way too often.
[22:43.19]And you know what's really funny about this?
[22:45.67]He's gonna get to level 10 dancing.
[22:50.19]War Chief.
[22:54.98]But when do you stop doing that?
[22:59.38]I think I'm just going to let him go.
[23:03.74]War chief material.
[23:07.02]God.
[23:12.84]Okay.
[23:20.39]I kind of do this shit though.
[23:22.37]I've already talked about this.
[23:25.19]There's been so many times that I've been about to eat food or eating food.
[23:28.73]I'll take a bite and come over and just do one of these.
[23:30.43]Okay.
[23:40.74]Same, right?
[23:41.74]Yeah.
[23:42.12]What was the last time you just... Sometimes I don't like sitting and eating.
[23:47.72]Sitting and eating kind of is annoying to me sometimes.
[23:50.14]I like standing and eating.
[23:53.62]Is that weird?
[23:55.80]Kind of walking around and taking a bite out of something and just kind of putting it down, like doing a couple of weird like steps like this.
[24:03.94]Putting my back against the wall, being like forward and then take another bite.
[24:08.20]I kind of do that.
[24:09.62]I don't do it that often.
[24:10.42]Okay, look, people that are like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[24:12.48]I don't do this every single time I eat food.
[24:15.32]I do this like once every like month.
[24:19.12]I do it like once a month.
[24:22.13]You're wicked annoying.
[24:24.92]Okay, if I invite friends over and we're going to have dinner, I'm not going to be, like, doing this stuff.
[24:33.07]No.
[24:33.23]That's the only way I'm just, like, I'm happy because the food's good.
[24:37.17]It's fun.
[24:37.39]Depends on the food.
[24:40.31]Yeah, I don't say, if I eat, like, a gross spaghetti or something and it's like, oh, this is, like, kind of undercooked and tastes awful, I'm not going to be like, ugh.
[24:48.28]Why would I do that?
[24:49.18]It has to be very good.
[24:54.38]How long am I gonna- wait, is the food done?
[24:59.72]Did I even turn the oven on?
[25:06.33]I don't think the oven's on.
[25:07.37]Alright, that's enough.
[25:09.95]Ah, from a froy.
[25:26.68]Is it still in there?
[25:27.67]Oh, it's perfect.
[25:33.71]Wow, it's excellent quality.
[25:37.83]Who the fuck is this?
[25:43.80]Who is this?
[25:44.54]Why is this person here?
[25:45.34]Soso.
[25:55.04]You're mad that I'm here.
[25:56.14]Why are you here?
[25:56.60]I stepped in shit.
[25:59.57]You stepped in it again.
[26:01.51]What's this?

[27:38.73]Honestly, what the fuck was that?
[27:43.10]This person knocks on my door, steps in shit outside on my porch, growls at me, starts to turn into a specter, and then starts yelling at my dog?
[27:51.85]I'm sorry.
[27:52.41]You're gonna get fucking Metal Gear Solid.
[27:54.61]I'm sorry.
[27:54.93]You're not gonna turn into, like, a vampire and start screaming at me in my house.
[27:57.05]I'm gonna bring out the Metal Gear Solid technique.
[28:00.06]I'm sorry.
[28:03.06]That was fucking scary.

[28:15.60]Yeah.
[28:19.60]That was scary!
[28:21.78]It took 27 minutes for you to kill somebody.
[28:25.25]I am sorry.
[28:27.19]I don't know what these mods activate.
[28:29.67]For all I know, that person could have been here to kill me.
[28:33.35]I don't know.
[28:33.81]These mods are out of control.
[28:34.95]I don't know what's going to happen here.
[28:40.25]What are you doing?
[28:51.52]Oh, you like the dog.
[28:53.74]Okay.
[28:58.58]Yeah, also Grump Klump helped find all these mods.

[29:08.48]This Warchief mod, I can't wait.
[29:10.08]Excellent.
[29:18.09]How do I get rid of this?
[29:19.65]Laugh?

[29:40.48]Murderer.
[29:43.30]What are you doing?
[29:55.93]I am on alert right now because I don't know if he's going to just attack me with that side.
[30:05.41]I need to give my dog... I need to relax after what just happened after being...
[30:10.23]Hey, you want some burger cake?
[30:14.19]I'm kind of hungry.
[30:14.81]What's up, Tim?
[30:38.62]Did I get rejected?
[30:48.42]I'm flattered, but I'm not interested in that type of relationship with you, but I would be happy if you would like to be friends.
[30:52.88]Okay.
[30:53.92]Well, I'm sure we'll be hearing from you very soon regardless because of the nature of me being attacked.
[31:02.38]That was weird.
[31:03.62]What was that actually?
[31:04.93]Was that person a monster?
[31:06.15]Were they a wizard?
[31:08.89]What was going on there?
[31:09.79]Why were they growling at me?
[31:12.07]Did I invite them into the house?
[31:13.79]And that was a vampire.
[31:16.31]Okay.
[31:21.34]So did me inviting that person into the house cause me danger?
[31:26.48]They were just doing vampire stuff.
[31:31.21]Growling at a new neighbor coming into the house.
[31:33.96]What are you doing?
[31:35.14]What are you doing?

[55:32.25]I don't want to get rid of the purple one.
[55:33.45]I want the red.
[55:34.29]But this is...
[55:39.81]No, I'm keeping these.
[55:42.37]Is that a pie?
[55:57.01]Did my guy get bigger?
[56:06.43]You have the worst trait in the whole game, which is what, the I want to be a Star Wars fan?
[56:13.63]Okay, so... Sith Holocron.
[56:21.05]Cool.
[56:23.05]I'm gonna... I'm gonna... Don't put that there.
[56:25.93]I'm trying to do this.
[56:28.03]Where did that just go?
[56:29.05]You idiot.
[56:29.95]Get rid of this.
[56:32.43]I'll sell a bunch of this shit, and then I gotta pay my bills.
[56:40.23]This is not important, right?
[56:47.34]Reddit gold mine.
[56:51.82]Now I can buy the chess table.
[56:55.70]They are very important.
[57:00.96]Oh, what about my poster?
[57:03.14]Only a hundred bucks?
[57:05.97]Oh, I don't want this anyways.
[57:08.78]Actually, what is this one?
[57:10.82]I'll keep that one here.
[57:12.52]Wait, I'm probably going to get a for the horde.
[57:13.94]Wait, I'm going to pretend that's a for the horde.
[57:18.21]What is this?
[57:20.03]Pile of presents.
[57:20.99]Four dollars?
[57:26.49]A comm link?
[57:28.96]What is this?
[57:29.48]Can I use it?
[57:39.43]No, what's the point of that?
[57:40.74]What's the dog barking at?
[57:41.70]Oh.
[57:45.52]Okay.
[57:46.04]I'm going to keep selling shit.
[57:54.60]What am I ever going to use this for?
[57:57.23]Okay, we got... I'm going to keep the kyber crystals.
[58:01.31]Who's buying the shit for one dollar?
[58:04.93]I'm going to keep the apples because it's, I don't know, it's kind of cool.
[58:07.77]I'm going to put the Sith holocron out here because it's cool.
[58:14.73]First order uniform.
[58:16.13]I'm not selling that.
[58:35.37]A blaster rifle?
[58:36.60]Oh, a cool plaque.
[58:44.60]Alright, I got enough money.
[58:51.47]Okay.
[58:58.99]So now I gotta pay my bills.
[59:02.69]Where's my mailbox?
[59:03.41]Okay, right here.
[59:06.14]655 bucks.
[59:06.34]And then I've got to make a logic table.
[59:09.85]What am I texting?
[59:21.53]Oh, baby.
[59:40.19]This is what we all were waiting for.
[59:41.41]And it's finally here.
[59:46.00]And I'm not even happy about it.
[59:49.58]I got all this stuff.
[59:50.96]Look, I've got like this $2,000 lightsaber.
[59:53.56]This $5,000 AR training unit.
[59:57.64]An authentic, signed, first order costume.
[60:02.57]And I don't care about it.
[60:06.78]Isn't this what I want?
[60:10.36]I thought I wanted this.
[60:24.85]You can now discuss workout techniques.
[60:26.89]What?
[60:27.21]Oh, this is not me training to be a Jedi.
[60:30.49]It's just me exercising.
[60:35.93]I thought I was training to be a Jedi Master.
[60:38.65]That's not what this was.
[60:39.63]Okay.
[60:49.92]Well, I got money.
[60:52.08]Jedi aren't real.
[60:59.31]What's... How do I fix this?
[61:03.52]Oh yeah, he like hates poop and stuff.
[61:06.06]Alright, empty the trash.
[61:09.06]Fill up the bowl.
[61:09.78]And clean this up.
[61:13.22]Clean up, because I gotta get to work tomorrow.
[61:15.66]One more log.
[61:16.20]I gotta read the book, right?
[61:16.94]What time is it?
[61:20.12]37 minutes I have to start working!
[61:21.26]Why was I out here swinging a lightsaber on like a fucking dickhead?
[61:24.74]What?
[61:25.14]Oh my god.
[61:25.88]Okay.
[61:26.14]37 minutes?
[62:00.05]God damn it.
[62:01.73]Don't go to bed What are you doing?
[62:07.27]That was so weird
[62:09.76]It's time to go to work.
[62:10.97]That was weird.
[62:11.67]He went under the cover.
[62:13.85]I need to be in my work outfit.
[62:17.15]Alright.
[62:17.79]Go to work.
[62:19.87]Work starts right now.
[62:20.91]Go to work.
[62:25.45]What?
[62:26.69]How do I go to work?
[62:35.74]How do I go to work?
[62:39.97]What's happening?
[62:44.22]It's not there.
[62:44.84]No, don't eat anymore cake.
[62:49.36]Go to work.
[62:49.88]It's time for work.
[62:50.38]I have to go to work.
[62:51.10]I don't want to get fired.
[62:54.90]How do I go to work?
[63:01.75]The mod's broken.
[63:04.43]Oh.
[63:05.85]The mod seems to be broken.
[63:10.69]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[63:13.82]So I gotta change jobs?
[63:15.18]Oh, no.
[63:16.14]We can't be a warchief.
[63:19.88]Yeah, this mod hasn't been updated, I don't think, in like three years or four years or something.
[63:23.59]That's funny.
[63:28.19]Although, let's try one more day.
[63:37.54]I'm gonna try going one more time.
[63:38.72]Alright, but if Thrall calls me, do I answer?
[63:41.34]Are we communicating?
[64:24.12]Okay.
[64:25.59]Alright, I need to be ready.
[64:30.17]What's the issue with it right now?
[64:31.97]I can't go to work.
[64:33.97]What are you doing?
[64:49.69]You have to clean this up.
[64:59.71]Geekcon is in- I'm dressed for the occasion right now.
[65:08.42]I'm gonna bring my lightsaber.
[65:09.63]I'm gonna bring my holocron.
[65:12.31]I'm gonna- I'm ready.
[65:13.83]I've been waiting for this.
[65:15.07]I am ready to go to Geekcon.
[65:30.70]I'm going to just stand in the middle of this place and just do lightsaber practice and people are going to be like, holy shit, that guy is the man.
[65:40.17]What are you doing?
[65:41.47]You're supposed to be in your outfit.
[65:42.89]What?
[65:48.87]Put it on.
[65:54.61]Okay.
[65:56.28]So this is geek con?
[66:07.53]what was that they just launched a rocket explore space uh yeah I think so where am I
[66:41.02]Very angry.
[66:43.58]Hold on, I gotta do this.
[66:47.98]Yes!
[66:52.33]No, come on, you're in front of a lot of people.
[66:55.63]You are blowing it so bad.
[66:56.79]Yes!
[67:11.68]So bad.
[67:15.26]What is this, like VR stations?
[67:22.65]Why am I so angry?
[67:23.89]This is like, I want to be here so bad.
[67:33.67]The Geekcon challenges have begun.
[67:34.93]Head to the computers to test your programming skills in hackathon or use the motion gaming to test... I don't have any gaming skills.
[67:49.22]Oh, I gotta test my gaming skills.
[67:51.70]Ultimate gaming test.
[67:52.56]Let's go.
[67:58.94]Wait, wait, I'll do that later.
[68:00.36]Hold on, I can upgrade the ship?
[68:08.16]Wait, what?
[68:14.93]Did I just spend $500 on this?
[68:16.37]Wait, what?
[68:21.21]What just happened?
[68:22.05]That was 500 bucks.
[68:24.63]That was a shitty ride in a theme park.
[68:27.09]No, I... This is taking role-playing to a whole new level here.
[68:33.25]I'm actually installing better rockets on this?
[68:38.75]Landing stabilizers?
[68:42.75]I canceled it.
[68:47.25]I'm going to upgrade this thing.
[68:52.36]This guy.
[68:53.48]This guy shouldn't be here.
[68:56.96]They need to put tape here.
[68:58.12]You know what I mean?
[68:59.22]Otherwise, I'm not supposed to be doing this.
[69:03.69]rocket science dude I'm leveling up a rocket science skill I'm not leaving I'm doing this for like the next five minutes how am I where else am I gonna level up rocket science Santa Santa's here he's joining the hackathon
[69:32.93]That's stupid.
[69:41.83]What's wrong?
[69:46.80]Stop, dude.
[69:47.82]Okay.
[69:50.62]Wait, is Santa going on a trip?
[69:56.47]By the way, I don't think anybody can get on this if I'm doing this.
[70:00.45]People can't get in here.
[70:02.93]I'm currently working on it.
[70:09.81]He is waiting in line to do this.
[70:24.80]I don't work here.
[70:26.56]Why are people letting me do this?
[70:28.52]Oh, this is a celebrity.
[70:35.52]Sandra just got an autograph.
[70:37.21]I know you want to get on the ship really badly, but that's not happening.
[70:42.89]It smells so bad.
[71:02.67]I keep shitting my head.
[71:14.29]Okay.
[71:18.35]How long can I do this for?
[71:20.37]Level three rocket science.
[71:21.97]I'm not leaving until I get to level five rocket science.
[71:24.59]Hackathon has come to an end.
[71:29.30]First place received the... Oh, you get a computer.
[71:34.94]75% done.
[71:35.90]I'll install something else.
[71:38.96]Oh no, I'm getting on this.
[71:40.04]I'm going to make sure I'm in the line first.
[71:50.59]Okay.
[71:54.07]I did it.
[71:57.29]Oh, I can't.
[71:58.53]No, no, no.
[71:58.77]I want to go now.
[71:59.99]It's my turn.
[72:05.34]Time to explore space.
[72:07.48]I upgraded this thing.
[72:08.39]What?
[72:31.77]Vlorg doesn't remember much, but thinks he may have been abducted.
[72:35.39]He now stands in a small sterile arena.
[72:38.95]A motley assemblage of hideous beings sits furtively in the bleachers.
[72:44.37]Slowly, a pedestal rises from the floor.
[72:46.19]It contains two items, a ball and a container with two holes, one round and one triangular.
[72:52.27]The room is tense with excitement.
[72:56.35]I mean, I'm gonna put it into the round hole.
[73:05.41]That's what I would do.
[73:07.08]The festival's gonna end before I come back to Earth.
[73:19.32]The round ball definitely slides into the round hole.
[73:25.15]and the room erupts into ferocious applause.
[73:27.47]Blorg instinctively bows graciously as the puzzle recedes back to the floor, replaced by a new one.
[73:33.11]This next rising pedestal has a hat.
[73:36.11]Yes, it's a very fine hat, perhaps a derby.
[73:38.48]What should Blorg do?
[73:41.04]Wear the hat.
[73:49.12]It's over in like 20 minutes.
[73:50.95]Am I gonna get stuck in outer space?
[74:00.75]Eureka!
[74:01.35]The hat goes on the head.
[74:02.43]More cheers spew forth from the crowd as Blorg rifles the hat into the stands with a flourish to be caught by one lucky fan.
[74:10.03]The hatless pedestal sinks and disappears into the ground and is shortly replaced again.
[74:13.67]This latest test pedestal appears to hold a chair, a simple metal chair.
[74:19.28]Alright.
[74:22.46]I think we're going to go, we're going to sit next to the chair.
[74:26.72]Because they're definitely doing this thing where it's like, oh, put the hat on.
[74:30.02]Put the circle into the circle.
[74:31.94]Sit in the chair.
[74:32.72]Dead, right?
[74:34.26]I'm going to sit next to the chair.
[74:43.22]No.
[74:43.53]You ruined it.
[74:48.53]What?
[74:51.66]Blorg is too smart for them.
[74:52.77]That chair is one of those moving platforms.
[74:55.21]As the crowd applauds Blorg's wisdom and foresight.
[74:59.53]Thank you, everybody.
[75:01.07]Please have a seat.
[75:03.21]The chair sinks down into the dark recesses in the floor, replaced by the next challenge.
[75:07.80]This pedestal is made of solid gold and contains valuable looking jewels.
[75:15.72]Hmm.
[75:22.92]I don't think I touched these.
[75:28.64]But wait, what if it's a shitload of money?
[75:35.02]I could actually just take it.
[75:36.32]I need the money.
[75:39.03]But it could be a trick.
[75:45.33]Thrall would want you to take it.
[75:47.05]Don't be greedy.
[75:49.81]Greed is good.
[75:50.33]Don't do it.
[75:53.39]Hmm.
[75:55.60]Okay, on one end, this is morality, right?
[75:59.50]No, I know that you're tempting me with riches.
[76:02.12]I don't want them.
[76:03.70]It's gonna be this is morality, right?
[76:05.77]But on the other hand, I could make like 10 grand.
[76:12.71]Are they testing morality?
[76:25.22]Another trick, Borg thinks as the gems glitter and sparkle.
[76:29.15]Then the alien beings look at each other in confusion.
[76:31.27]Does he not know the value of what is presented?
[76:33.01]A buzzer unmistakably indicates failure.
[76:42.61]Bring me back.
[76:43.09]I want to take the jewels.
[76:44.40]I want to go back.
[76:45.08]I'm going back to space.
[76:45.90]Bring it back.
[76:46.28]I'm going back in.
[76:47.38]I'm going back to space.
[76:48.98]I'm going back.
[76:49.42]See you later.
[76:49.88]It was nice to see everybody.
[76:51.24]I'm going back up there and I'm going to take the jewels this time.
[76:55.38]back up.
[77:12.62]What?
[77:13.18]Passing the planet Yang, Blorg sees a weary-looking alien standing amid a huge pile of trash bags and rusty futon parts.
[77:21.18]Sounds like he's moving to a new pad on the planet Rompeter.
[77:26.06]And his friend, who was supposed to help, just bailed.
[77:29.38]Blorg's got some extra time.
[77:30.42]Should he pitch in?
[77:31.12]There's no no.
[77:34.22]Sure.
[77:36.26]You can't... I can't... No.
[77:42.67]Is there enough time to get one of these funny hot dogs?
[77:47.85]What's wrong?
[77:51.41]Good thing Blorg has an expanded cargo bay.
[77:54.46]From being a Jedi.
[77:56.10]It's a lot of stuff to move.
[77:58.04]Old concert tees, milk crate furniture.
[78:00.70]But it all fits in pretty easily and they blast off for Rumpeter.
[78:03.94]The alien is so grateful he gives Blorg his least dirty futon mattress as thanks.
[78:08.18]Blorg incinerates it.
[78:17.09]I wanna... Lost in a nebula.
[78:46.19]Blork instruments go haywire and his rocket ship is bathed in purple light.
[78:49.89]Purple and gold dust coats the sky as far as the eye can see, which isn't that far.
[78:53.91]He must have drifted into a giant nebula.
[78:56.05]Blork can send out a call for help or forge ahead and hope the instruments can sort it out.
[79:07.03]Forge forward.
[79:15.12]I just got rocket science.
[79:21.65]Borg wanders through the cloud.
[79:22.99]The dance of gold and purple is almost hypnotic.
[79:25.26]An exquisite dream or luxurious grave.
[79:30.44]What?
[79:31.98]He is at peace with the beauty of his lugubrious fate when suddenly the ship breaks through into the clear.
[79:38.23]He's free.
[79:38.77]He just needs a little more luck.
[79:40.25]He's got to get home on fumes.
[79:43.03]Am I gonna die up here?
[79:46.81]Oh shit!
[80:18.47]I made it!
[80:27.19]Okay.
[80:28.77]We're good.
[80:30.97]Okay.
[80:31.97]The convention's over.
[80:38.34]The convention ended already.
[80:40.58]I gotta go home.
[80:48.53]Do you have a bathroom?
[80:49.63]Where's the dog?
[80:51.57]I hear a dog.
[80:52.65]Can I bonk?
[81:17.73]A bunch of alien travel
[81:29.72]He's so exhausted, comes home, sits down in a chair and just shits his pants!
[81:36.22]Oh my god!
[81:37.62]This guy is exhausted!
[81:38.76]He is so tired!
[81:40.24]Oh, I feel so bad!
[81:57.47]On an adventure.
[81:58.85]He's asleep.
[82:00.35]It's like, dude, the guy in the First Order costume shit his pants.
[82:08.10]I don't know who we call about this.
[82:10.10]Who do we talk to about this?
[82:11.28]Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[82:15.27]I think the guy in the Sith outfit.
[82:16.81]He's in there sitting down.
[82:17.53]I think he shit his pants.
[82:20.15]Do we call security?
[82:21.25]Okay.
[82:30.47]I'm in REM sleep right now.
[82:37.86]Oh my goodness.

[83:02.20]what honestly what was that I'm curious how this plays out let's just see what happens
[83:35.69]I have to be careful taking a sip of this.
[83:37.17]I'm gonna choke on this.

[85:36.06]It's time to get up.
[85:39.36]It's time to sing karaoke.
[85:42.10]This is so loud.
[85:45.66]I have to turn it down.
[85:48.26]Or it gives me a headache.
[85:54.52]I think it's safe for me to save here.
[86:04.41]What are they all saying?
[86:05.99]Oh, there's a celebrity behind me.
[86:07.37]Celebrity.
[86:08.61]That's an absolute proper celebrity.
[86:14.54]Okay.
[86:33.80]He took a step back.
[86:34.94]Can I sing?
[86:37.00]I'll punish Montanini.
[86:59.35]I need to go home.

[87:07.94]Oh, dude, hold on.
[87:18.48]You just cut the music?
[87:46.27]Or is she looking at me?
[87:47.53]She stopped because I'm doing this.
[87:49.75]I don't know what happened.
[88:00.70]She's stuck.
[88:01.36]I think she's just confused at what I'm doing.
[88:03.99]I'm incredibly distracting.
[88:13.38]I want to sing.
[88:13.88]Why can I not sing?
[88:18.08]Too uncomfortable.
[88:18.98]No, don't go to bed.
[88:19.38]I want to hang out.
[88:20.27]Look, just eat the apples that are in your mouth.
[88:23.51]Who cares?
[88:23.97]Eat plants.
[88:42.36]Two Apple Andy.
[88:44.12]What am I doing?
[88:55.51]What is this?
[88:56.79]Oh my god!
[89:09.20]Let's go watch this in the sink.
[89:13.60]No, I want to do that.
[89:42.67]Can I like wash my hands and brush my teeth in a public bathroom?
[89:49.66]This is a very strange person.
[89:56.62]What?
[90:03.70]I can talk to the toilet.
[90:20.28]Special effects?
[90:25.70]Oh, I can turn it off and on.
[90:26.97]That's kind of cool.
[90:29.55]Okay, I gotta go home.
[90:31.91]It's over.
[90:32.69]Time to leave.
[90:33.11]That was a fun geek con.
[90:38.31]It's time to go to bed.
[90:41.25]I think somebody else shit their pants.
[90:43.01]I don't think it was me.
[90:44.97]See you later, everybody.
[90:49.93]Upgrade their toilet.
[90:50.87]No, I'm going to pass out.
[90:52.39]I'm going to fall asleep on the ground.
[90:59.86]Send him back to space.
[91:02.30]I don't think I can do that anymore.
[91:03.50]Look, I got rocket science 4 from that.
[91:10.10]I can make my own rocket
[91:16.19]That was an adventure.
[91:23.04]That was... out of control.
[91:24.92]Oh, I got an achievement.
[91:27.08]Played The Sims 4 for five hours.
[91:30.18]Okay.
[91:31.52]Um, that was an eventful day.
[91:32.67]I have to go to work in seven hours, so let's make sure I get some sleep and take a shower.
[91:37.91]That's important, number one.
[91:45.29]And then we're going to go to bed.
[91:49.55]How do you upgrade a bed?
[91:50.69]How does that mean?
[91:57.28]How would I upgrade the bed with a wrench?
[92:04.92]Oh.
[92:09.93]There we go.
[92:13.51]Alright, I'll get rid of these.
[92:15.09]Too many Sims.
[92:17.81]We're good.
[92:20.93]You got food, right?
[92:22.17]How are you doing?
[92:22.71]Are you good?
[92:24.79]You want a treat before I go to bed?
[92:27.47]Here, have a treat before I go to bed.
[92:29.44]You also need... This dog needs a bath every day.
[92:32.94]Every single day.
[92:33.96]Okay.
[92:36.16]Sleep.
[92:36.82]Sleep.
[92:44.31]Feed him.
[92:44.53]He's got food here.
[92:46.81]Alright.
[92:49.15]It's time to see if I can go to work.
[92:53.11]What's wrong?
[92:53.47]You okay?
[92:54.75]What's the matter?
[92:55.13]Oh, we're good.
[93:00.73]Two hours.
[93:03.56]Alright.
[93:04.08]I need to be up.
[93:06.20]So get up.
[93:07.28]Have some food.
[93:07.90]What do you got?
[93:10.38]Leftovers?
[93:10.62]Leftovers?
[93:14.68]Let's see if I can go to work.
[93:16.58]What's this so dirty?
[93:19.02]It's the same dirty spoiled cake.
[93:20.66]I was eating at that restaurant Okay, it's 8 a.m.. Go to work.
[93:32.47]Oh I think it's broken.
[93:42.23]It's broken
[93:44.67]You can't go to work.
[93:47.42]Well, looks like I'm going to be a rocket scientist.
[93:50.82]Sorry, Thrall.
[93:51.76]It was funny.
[93:52.48]It was fun.
[93:52.94]Okay.
[93:56.16]Uh, I can do it on the computer, right?
[93:59.81]Career.
[94:00.29]Find a job.
[94:06.47]Alright.
[94:07.67]Astronaut.
[94:10.35]That seems pretty good, right?
[94:11.64]Is it astronaut or is it rocket scientist?
[94:21.06]Okay.
[94:21.72]Oh, wait, scientist.
[94:23.58]Which one?
[94:28.41]Which one is it building rockets?
[94:30.71]Scientist or astronaut?
[94:35.51]Wait, there's a rocket scientist.
[94:38.65]So I could do so do scientist because rocket scientist is a scientist.
[94:44.86]Okay.
[94:45.98]Oh, I could have just read the tagline here.
[94:49.22]Okay.
[94:52.80]Scientist who proves they've got the gray matter to change the world as we know it can unlock new offices.
[94:56.82]Like the UFO hunter with a chemistry lab.
[95:01.47]Okay.
[95:03.23]An astronaut is space ranger and interstellar smuggler.
[95:09.33]Hmm.
[95:11.47]This is important.
[95:13.09]I think we're going to need to have to do this with a poll.
[95:19.01]Astronaut or rocket scientist?
[95:29.69]You actually get to go to work as a scientist.
[95:32.57]Interesting.
[95:35.71]Either scientist or astronaut.
[95:37.47]Which one?
[95:45.50]Science, science, astronaut, astronaut.
[95:53.26]OK, astronaut or scientist.
[95:58.53]How do you spell astronaut?
[96:00.69]I don't know.
[96:03.57]Scientist.
[96:06.18]Just one minute.
[96:07.00]Doesn't matter.
[96:07.48]Oh, two minutes.
[96:07.86]It's fine.
[96:08.06]How do you spell astronaut?
[96:15.42]Yeah, I got it right.
[96:15.94]Okay.
[96:18.05]Oh, Paul's already active.
[96:19.05]Oops.
[96:22.39]Hey, don't influence the vote.
[96:23.85]Don't influence.
[96:25.89]Just ask the question.
[96:33.55]Well, you guys are being influenced.
[96:38.55]Sorry about that.
[96:46.65]Okay, so Sims in the scientist career are more likely to be abducted.
[96:51.07]Okay.
[96:58.59]Satellite dish allows you to contact aliens.
[97:06.80]okay I mean that's cool I probably would have I'm why am I sweaty I think I was laughing too hard alright I mean it's that's the way it is we're doing we're doing scientist scientist
[97:40.93]Alright.
[97:42.87]I need to have two breakthroughs.
[97:45.05]I don't know what that means.
[97:45.89]Have two breakthroughs?
[97:56.32]While gardening, reading, or performing experiments.
[97:59.34]Should I read?
[97:59.88]Alright, first of all, clean up.
[98:04.64]This is a mess.
[98:07.92]And I got to work in lifestyle that was previously hidden.
[98:12.68]View the lifestyle menu.
[98:14.26]Wait, what?
[98:19.90]I got single and loving it.
[98:29.00]Okay.
[98:29.24]Alright.
[98:32.12]So I start work in two days.
[98:34.72]So I have a lot of time.
[98:37.36]I just got to get my mood up.
[98:39.12]I got to get focused.
[98:40.66]And I need to have a couple of breakthroughs.
[98:43.86]So how am I doing right now?
[98:45.30]I'm pretty good.
[98:45.74]Let's start to read.
[98:46.68]Read a puzzle book or something, right?
[98:54.57]I should probably do logic again.
[98:57.27]Where is it?
[99:01.01]Where's the logic book?
[99:06.27]Should I purchase, like, is there a science book?
[99:10.54]Wait, Rocket Science, Volume 1.
[99:12.48]There it is.
[99:19.91]Bingo.
[99:24.69]Alright, have a couple breakthroughs.
[99:36.21]You good?
[99:36.55]Dureka!
[99:41.69]Lord McDulty had his first breakthrough and wrote down an idea for a momentum conserver.
[99:45.89]Click on the notebook button at the top of the phone to learn more about it.
[99:58.79]Huh?
[100:03.49]Where?
[100:07.79]Change phone background, silence phone, change phone cover.
[100:13.85]Where is it?
[100:22.96]What's it above the phone?
[100:27.12]Wait, no ingredients required.
[100:28.63]Can I just make it?
[100:33.71]No ingredients required.
[100:34.75]How do I do this?
[100:38.64]Do I need like a science thing?
[100:40.00]A science table?
[100:43.36]It's a perpetual motion machine?
[100:54.83]Wait, are perpetual motion machines impossible?
[101:05.11]They can't exist, right?
[101:06.75]They don't exist.
[101:14.23]But don't they make these... I feel like I've seen a perpetual motion machine.
[101:17.49]Where it's like... A ball can just keep moving.
[101:22.09]Like, over and over again.
[101:26.11]They can work.
[101:27.35]It's not perfect.
[101:30.35]Isn't the dog at the mall the thing that goes... A perpetual motion machine?
[101:38.73]Oh, no.
[101:39.01]It needs power.
[101:42.69]How do you make one?
[101:51.58]Alright, I can't keep fucking talking like that.
[101:54.74]I just asked you guys how to make a perpetual motion machine.
[101:57.58]Something that, like, science has never figured out over fucking a hundred years of scientific research.
[102:04.77]How do you guys make one?
[102:12.35]Only a hundred years?
[102:16.66]More like hundreds.
[102:18.52]Well, you know what I mean.
[102:20.38]They're inherently not possible.
[102:25.18]This dog is... This dog is fucking filthy all day.
[102:31.49]Every day.
[102:32.61]The dog is filthy.
[102:36.85]I don't know what to do about this.
[102:37.99]It's every single day.
[102:45.54]Well, because everything needs power to operate, right?
[102:47.32]So you can't.
[102:49.76]Because if you have a battery-operated perpetual motion machine, you need to replace the batteries.
[102:58.07]Oh, hold on.
[102:59.65]I'm focused right now.
[103:04.41]Why can't I read that?
[103:05.37]Is it in my inventory?
[103:07.53]Alright, read it.
[103:12.46]Battery operated perpetual motion.
[103:14.56]COVID messed up his head.
[103:22.06]Here it is.
[103:22.40]Ooh, my voice.
[103:23.66]Okay, so I got what I needed.
[103:26.98]Two breakthroughs and I need to be focused.
[103:28.82]I am focused.
[103:32.34]I have to go to work focused.
[103:33.80]Alright.
[103:34.40]And that is in a while.
[103:38.36]I know how to make one, but I won't tell you.
[103:51.93]Why not?
[103:52.61]Yeah, that's rude.
[103:55.13]Okay, so I'm focused.
[103:56.64]I've done some rocket science.
[104:00.42]I am going to make sure I am fully fulfilled for tomorrow.
[104:04.80]What's wrong?
[104:05.50]Okay, I'm a little sad.
[104:07.56]And amateur hour.
[104:10.63]You're bored from this book.
[104:12.83]Oh.
[104:14.85]Alright, let me have a little bit of fun.
[104:24.43]Just, like, literally, information on vampires, or whatever.
[104:26.60]This is the kind of shit that I would just have autoplay at YouTube.
[104:34.08]And just, I don't know, just watch, like, fucking ten videos about it.
[104:41.85]Dude, I watched, um... Lord realized that fucking Golic and Plasma can be found in Forgotten Hollow.
[104:50.15]Oh, alright.
[104:51.77]Is fucking Golic in there?
[104:56.33]So.
[105:05.03]This dude has a problem.
[105:16.91]I couldn't even continue what I was going to say.
[105:21.38]You can purchase the vampire book.
[105:24.69]Okay, well, you had some fun.
[105:25.79]Cool.
[105:29.84]I need to eat?
[105:35.88]Dude, a flavor enhancer?
[105:37.02]I want to do this stuff.
[105:39.55]How do I get... I want to read a book about being handy.
[105:44.71]Because having... This is perfect.
[105:51.68]Wait.
[105:52.08]Repair.
[105:54.18]That'll help, right?
[105:54.80]For the dog's sake, the dog deserves to be happy.
[106:01.60]What?
[106:14.32]No cheating.
[106:16.30]I'm going to give the dog a bath and then play with the dog.
[106:22.56]Yes, you like being you like being a handy worker.
[106:26.62]OK, cool.
[106:27.08]Alright, come over here.
[106:28.94]Let's have a bath.
[106:30.22]Come with me.
[106:32.24]You're going to get a big treat and then we're going to play fetch.
[106:37.20]What happened?
[106:43.21]What are my dreams?
[106:47.35]You want to be a debate captain?
[106:53.72]I want to have a nerdy conversation.
[106:55.18]I want to listen to lullabies.
[106:57.54]I want to get some sleep and be funny in a crowded place.
[107:01.24]Okay.
[107:06.66]Well, I can get this done.
[107:11.28]How much is just like a little, a little radio?
[107:14.26]I need a, okay.
[107:17.02]I need a little end table with a radio.
[107:28.75]Okay, now I need a radio.
[107:34.22]Just like a little one.
[107:35.10]Just a little one, like this one.
[107:39.42]This thing is way too big.
[107:45.74]A cafe wall speaker?
[107:47.22]Okay.
[107:53.16]Okay, listen to...
[108:01.17]lullabies radio alright you did doing better happy look happy okay let's fulfill one of your dreams
[108:49.77]Why does this guy want to listen to the first 15 seconds of every horror movie trailer?
[108:55.43]That's kind of weird.
[109:12.95]Are you fulfilled?
[109:14.07]Not quite.
[109:14.69]Now you want to listen to retro music.
[109:17.49]Okay.
[109:19.97]Next song on this album.
[109:31.22]Why would you have this album?
[109:47.13]What happened?
[109:49.75]Oh my god.
[109:50.53]Alright, where's Retro?
[109:51.73]Retro!
[110:00.73]Go on, listen.
[110:01.33]If I keep that, is it bad?
[110:18.02]This is like, I don't know, I tell you guys about like when I used to fall asleep, if a DVD was in the DVD player, and it would just be on the 25 second song that was at the menu screen for the DVD, and falling asleep to that was unbearable.
[110:39.49]You would hear it cycle over and over again, and it would wake you up, and it would piss you off.
[110:45.32]But you wouldn't get up and turn it off.
[110:50.59]Don't even mention Shrek.
[110:52.55]Yeah, like, you would all of a sudden just hear, like, oh, the years start coming in, they don't stop coming, years stop coming, and you're just like, shut the fuck up.
[110:59.07]Shut up.
[111:00.21]But you're just so tired, you just don't care, you don't want to get out of bed, you don't want to, where's the remote, right?
[111:06.71]I remember the Punisher DVD.
[111:10.90]The menu of that DVD is a song.
[111:15.38]And it's like... It's a guy with an acoustic guitar.
[111:20.23]And it's like... They may come back someday.
[111:26.10]Live once more, die once more.
[111:30.84]And it would just go, it would happen to, oh, it was 20 seconds of that song.
[111:34.20]It would play over and over and over and over again.
[111:37.36]And I would just wake up over and over to like the, they may come back someday.
[111:42.86]I'd be like, please, God, please, I want, please, I hope there's a power outage.
[111:48.25]Please, I'm praying for power outage right now because I don't want to do this.
[111:51.73]Oh, shit.
[111:53.59]Stop it, stop it, stop that.
[111:57.93]$378?
[112:01.33]Where am I?
[112:02.05]I can repair this.
[112:12.74]This dog is fucking filthy every day.
[112:16.04]This dog needs a bath every six hours.
[112:27.95]What?
[112:28.25]Oh, we need to go.

[113:02.35]I can't believe he pissed on this person.
[113:06.85]I can't believe he pissed on him.
[113:08.83]I can't believe that dog just did this.
[113:12.31]This person walks through the wall.
[113:13.63]This person might be a scary person. ...
[113:29.99]Want some coffee?
[113:34.10]Did I even fix the toilet?
[113:36.90]I did, okay.

[130:46.70]Brainstorm on invention constructor.
[130:49.98]Okay.
[130:51.80]I'm too angry to do anything.
[130:57.12]Oh, you guys can't see that.
[130:57.88]My camera's blocking it.
[131:00.57]Should I move the cam to the top right?
[131:02.89]But I think that blocks... There's a lot of information that gets blocked.
[131:08.55]I think a lot of information gets blocked, no matter where it goes.
[131:17.82]Put it middle left?
[131:21.55]Like here?
[131:26.41]Is that good right there?
[131:33.11]No.
[131:35.62]Middle right?
[131:37.28]Like here?
[131:39.30]You'll miss info.
[131:40.04]Like right here?
[131:41.70]Maybe right here is good.
[131:45.13]What do you think?
[131:45.69]Right there?
[131:45.97]I think that looks alright.
[131:48.95]There's not important information that's there.
[131:57.92]The brightness is really high on this right now too.
[131:59.94]Hold on.
[132:08.14]That's what's making me red.
[132:10.04]I figured it out.
[132:14.50]I had this weird color corrector on.
[132:19.10]That's why it's doing that.
[132:24.02]Okay, well let's fix this.
[132:30.81]That's better.
[132:32.24]We're still in 60 FPS?
[132:33.24]Alright, we're good.
[132:44.91]Alright, I saved the game.
[132:48.55]Now, how... What am I supposed to do about this?
[132:53.33]You have a bug.
[132:54.07]Please fix it.
[132:54.69]You gotta restart to fix it after you apply the fix.
[132:57.70]What?
[133:01.81]I have the angry bug?
[133:10.26]The sim is always mean.
[133:11.76]It's a bug.
[133:16.53]I'll do it after work.
[133:17.75]Do I have to just restart the game, or how do I fix it?
[133:29.74]Is there a delay on your camera?
[133:30.90]No, there isn't.
[133:32.26]I don't know.
[133:33.12]I gotta figure out why people are saying that.
[133:35.50]Here we go.
[133:35.78]I'm doing work.
[133:42.75]Go to computer.
[133:45.41]And put on the command center.
[133:47.98]Okay.
[133:50.12]Okay.
[133:58.92]There is a tiny delay.
[133:59.92]I'm going to try something here.
[134:03.86]Just bear with me for one second while I do this.
[134:16.25]Did that fix it?
[134:17.27]Ready?
[134:18.75]So right now I should be really delayed.
[134:22.38]I should be very delayed.
[134:24.24]Right now.
[134:27.76]That's correct.
[134:32.54]Now it shouldn't be.
[134:34.78]It should be fine now.
[134:38.13]What is it?
[134:44.05]That's the question.
[134:52.89]Wrong way?
[134:54.23]Yeah, I don't understand.
[134:55.45]It's very weird.
[134:56.05]I wonder if it's something with the camera.
[135:07.51]Let me try one more thing.
[135:15.07]Did that fix it?
[135:17.61]Can you guys hear me?
[135:22.62]Are we good?
[135:28.94]Is it better?
[135:30.64]There's no delay.
[135:31.84]I'm going to watch some clips when this is done and see if I can recreate what's going on here.
[135:39.26]Okay.
[135:40.98]But anyways, yeah, so I have to fix this.
[135:43.49]I have to go to the MC command center and then go to MC tuner and go to interactions and disable mean interactions.
[135:51.85]Really?
[135:55.81]I'll fix it after this today.
[136:05.41]This is scary.
[136:13.32]Mean is fun.
[136:22.14]Oh!
[136:22.92]Okay, hold on.
[136:23.44]Here we go.
[136:29.04]Okay, I can brainstorm now.
[136:32.55]Minerva's calling me.
[136:33.43]Hey, Blurg, I think Britanny Cho is pretty cute.
[136:38.67]Should I ask her out?
[136:39.39]Uh, I don't know who that is.
[136:46.79]Sure, go for it, I guess.
[136:48.01]I don't know who that is.
[136:50.79]Why do people call... Why do people call you to ask you if they should go... I don't get that.
[136:57.60]I've never met that person before.
[136:58.72]I don't know who that is.
[136:59.40]I can't give you good advice.
[137:00.22]Ooh, hold on.
[137:07.07]Brainstorming.
[137:15.29]Okay, get to know.
[137:16.65]Experiment on the chemistry lab.
[137:18.03]Okay, you done with that?
[137:27.42]It's almost, I'm almost done with work and I haven't done anything.
[137:29.68]I don't even have half a bar bubble filled.

[137:37.26]What happened?
[137:38.71]What happened?

[139:20.62]Oh, I'm hungry.
[139:23.44]Alright, I need to practice analysis.
[139:27.38]I would have touched the CEO in a meeting.
[139:32.79]Because it said, like, vibe your way over here.
[139:34.83]I would have touched the CEO?
[139:41.62]Alright, you're done with this.
[139:42.28]Go over this way.
[139:43.44]Alright, I'm never going to work with this guy again.
[139:45.62]Like, he can just go.
[139:47.34]It's too much.
[139:48.02]It's too much stress.

[142:45.38]I like Star Wars.
[142:46.59]Some of it.
[142:48.31]But, I mean, I don't want it to be my complete aspiration in my life to go to the Disney World Star Wars park every day.
[142:56.23]You know what I mean?
[142:56.99]Like, I don't... I need to change this to be, like, build a rocket.
[143:02.84]I currently just need to go... Alright, I just need to go to Batuu and just fulfill this.

[226:13.14]Who's getting arrested?
[226:19.02]Did he call the police?
[226:20.30]I don't understand what happened.
[226:22.14]What, because I took a lightsaber out?
[226:25.54]Where did I go?
[226:26.22]I need to read this.

[226:37.75]Bribery is the answer.
[226:38.75]Bribe other civs for their friendships.
[226:41.20]Drive bosses for a boost in job performance.
[226:43.02]Money solves everything.
[226:44.32]Who are they arresting?
[226:49.76]He can throw his very own lampoon party.
[226:51.66]I haven't done what he's... Did he just... What did he just do?
[226:58.82]Huh?
[227:15.22]You did attack Santa with a lightsaber.
[227:20.38]Those are like just things I don't, I don't think I've, whatever sentence I'd never say.
[227:26.81]I mean, yes, I did attack Santa with a lightsaber.
[227:30.93]This is accurate.
[227:39.14]But then I gave him a thousand bucks, and we hashed it out.
[227:42.46]And then he called the police.
[227:44.80]Wait, what?
[227:46.75]This person wants to punch me and steal my money?
[227:52.71]What?
[228:10.15]Who?
[228:12.15]Did you know it was rebate day?
[228:21.66]Yogg's.
[228:21.98]Siglun Habiro.
[228:23.42]Vinacapa.
[228:24.26]Don Kubu.
[228:26.22]Don Kubu.
[228:26.92]Can tie him out.
[228:39.83]Alright, time for bed.
[228:44.44]Wait, I'm almost... How old am I?
[228:46.16]Okay, I'm almost an adult.
[228:48.82]Who was punching people?
[228:50.70]They said this person's been punching me and tried to take my money.
[228:56.72]Am I ordering drinks?
[229:10.74]You slapped Santa.
[229:13.54]No, but I didn't slap anybody else.
[229:16.84]I said, hey, this Sim is slapping me and trying to take my money.
[229:20.34]That's not... Santa didn't say that.
[229:21.58]Alright, go home.
[229:23.45]Somebody was dancing.
[229:47.73]Your sim was saying that about the other clerk that left.
[229:51.01]She wanted to take your money.
[229:54.98]Really?
[229:55.26]Alright, we're going to the vet tomorrow because I don't know what this means.
[230:03.83]Do I have to work?
[230:06.87]Oh, I gotta work tomorrow.
[230:19.56]Look at this dirty ass bathtub I have to put a fire out Order a pizza
[230:48.79]Bitter about Santa.
[230:54.48]Hey, come over here.
[231:00.02]Let's... I'm going to take you to the vet.
[231:03.75]Back from work tomorrow.
[231:09.81]I'm going to take a bath.
[231:19.48]um so I think honestly I think the funniest thing that happened today was the getting off of the spaceship shitting my pants and falling asleep in the chair at the geek convention I don't think anything will compare to that
[231:43.04]I keep thinking about it.
[231:44.96]It keeps popping up here.
[231:46.10]Just sitting down, nodding this way and shitting my pants after getting off.
[231:51.27]I feel like three, like what would probably amount to like 10 light years worth of time traveling.
[231:58.79]Okay.
[232:03.35]I can't believe you can tap me.
[232:06.29]This game is unbelievable.
[232:08.01]How do I keep sleeping on this game?
[232:18.21]I don't have any money.
[232:19.53]Imagine shitting yourself at Comic Con.
[232:29.88]I have $58.
[232:31.44]I gave Santa $1,000.
[232:35.00]For forgiveness.
[232:36.82]And it worked for 10 seconds.
[232:38.66]And then he called the police.
[232:49.57]Alright, get to bed.
[232:55.75]There's too much to do.
[232:56.61]Alright, get up.
[233:07.94]Got a lucrative opportunity for someone who doesn't ask too many questions.
[233:10.38]I need you to hold on to a stack of money.
[233:11.94]What?
[233:14.62]I need to hold on to a stack of simoleons.
[233:17.34]I'm planning to launder until the trail turns cold.
[233:20.34]Sure, it may not be legal or moral, but it'll help.
[233:30.89]That's all I gotta do?
[233:34.97]Ah!
[233:36.69]Anybody want a piece of cake?
[233:37.43]It's the only food I eat.
[233:40.09]Mmm...
[233:47.99]Spend all the money?
[233:48.81]Let's get a huge plasma screen TV and when she shows up, be like, I don't know what happened.
[233:55.97]Somebody attacked me for it.
[233:59.70]Mm-hmm.
[234:07.24]A bro-sid-do-ka.
[234:08.64]Bizzic, Fluhane.
[234:10.28]Bin-fa-hip.

[234:30.10]Okay.
[234:32.10]Actually, it might get promoted.
[234:34.18]It's possible, although I'm uncomfortable.
[234:38.06]This has to be a little bit higher, right?
[234:43.09]Not quite.
[234:48.05]What's up?
[234:51.11]Just... Stop calling me for this shit.
[234:54.77]Hey, Blork.
[234:55.21]I wanted to know.
[234:55.83]I'm trying to get to know this other sim.
[234:57.11]Do you think I should?
[234:57.81]It's like, why... What does this even do for me?
[234:59.85]Okay.
[235:14.12]Alright.
[235:15.88]We are gonna go to the vet.
[235:21.07]How do I go about doing this?

[242:06.35]But come on inside.
[242:09.57]Let's go.
[242:09.95]I don't want any strenuous activity.
[242:15.32]I'm going to clean this bath.
[242:20.68]How do I clean this?
[242:22.34]It's fucking gross.
[242:26.17]Oh, there we go.
[242:26.61]Okay.
[242:37.22]Okay.
[242:37.76]Go to the... No, you don't have to use the bath.
[242:39.06]Alright, so now I need to eat.
[242:43.60]Drop it.
[242:46.24]Oh, no, no, no.
[242:46.94]I don't have to drop it.
[242:48.30]You're fine.
[243:05.40]What's first person mode?
[243:09.68]T, right?
[243:21.03]Alright, let's go.
[243:24.57]Holy shit, you maniac!
[243:29.03]Why did you do that?
[243:30.39]Why would you do that?
[243:45.38]How do I look at the...
[243:52.21]It's kinda scary.
[243:55.04]How do I get access to the mouse to look at stuff?
[244:06.19]Escape.
[244:06.55]Oh, okay.
[244:06.87]That was weird.
[244:36.38]Troll the forums.
[244:46.93]Don't I have work in ten minutes?
[244:48.99]I'm going to let him do it.
[244:59.63]Oh.
[245:10.82]Are you having a good time, at least?
[245:18.45]Wait, it's summertime.
[245:19.33]I'm going for a swim.
[245:23.77]Wait, skinny dip with who?
[245:44.85]Hey, hold on.
[245:45.71]Carpool will be at work here soon.
[245:47.11]Hold on.
[245:47.60]Just wait a minute.
[245:48.16]I have to swim naked in the ocean for five minutes.
[246:23.46]Get in your house.
[246:24.40]What are you doing?
[246:25.14]I'm not going to go to work naked.
[246:45.15]No, you change into work clothes.
[246:47.48]Yeah, you do.
[246:47.94]Alright.
[246:59.72]She's pretty happy.
[247:04.89]I said, dude, no offense, but your house looks like a hotel room.
[247:09.25]Do I still have this angry anger bug that I never fixed?
[247:13.93]That's actually kind of funny.
[247:18.66]Yelling co-workers.
[247:31.90]Alright.
[247:33.72]I haven't been promoted.
[247:34.62]Okay, retro music.
[247:42.85]It wants me to put a fire out.
[247:44.61]How do I start a fire?
[247:51.41]How do I start a fire?
[247:52.31]I need to put a fire out.
[248:11.47]Alright, what do I want to listen to?
[248:13.83]Retro music, right.
[248:14.73]Alright, fulfill.
[248:20.11]There you go.
[248:20.85]Aren't you happy?
[248:24.30]And I'm going to order a pizza.
[248:26.76]Yep.
[248:40.05]I'm going to get a pepperoni.
[248:40.85]That sounds so good, actually.
[248:47.43]Pepperoni pizza sounds amazing right now.
[248:55.18]Thin crust, yep.
[248:57.42]Thin crust, you can hold it up and it goes like this.
[248:59.72]Like that.
[249:00.06]Not like this.
[249:01.98]Like that.
[249:03.46]And you fold it a little bit at the end and you...
[249:14.20]People go, will you fold?
[249:15.06]I fold sometimes.
[249:18.46]Not every time, but enough sometimes when I do it.
[249:23.64]And you get that sting.
[249:25.28]That tang.
[249:26.68]That umami.
[249:35.58]When did I say that?
[249:37.26]I was talking about it.
[249:38.26]I was eating food and I said there's too much umami in this and I couldn't eat it anymore and I was high.
[249:48.64]Ollie, are you here?
[249:52.50]I was eating something, and it was too umami, and I couldn't eat it anymore.
[249:58.39]I was like, this is like umami overload, and I just couldn't eat it anymore.
[250:02.05]It was like too delicious.
[250:03.59]It was like overload.
[250:05.83]I forget what it was.
[250:06.53]It was... Wait, really?
[250:12.14]Really?
[250:14.25]It was blue cheese sauce that you put all over a garlic pizza.
[250:23.77]I think that's right.
[250:29.90]And it was just, I couldn't take it.
[250:31.92]It was fucking delicious.
[250:43.28]It was a no red sauce pizza.
[250:46.35]What was it?
[250:50.79]It was, okay.
[250:52.17]It was a buffalo chicken pizza that I put a bunch of blue cheese sauce on and it was overloading me.
[251:02.60]It was a buffalo chicken pizza covered in blue cheese.
[251:08.48]And the type of sauce on the pizza and they had the way that it was hitting me right here to a point where I couldn't eat it anymore.
[251:17.25]It was actually sensory overload.
[251:18.47]You also really high.
[251:19.39]Yeah.
[251:21.75]I mean, I was a little.
[251:25.69]Again, like, you know, recreational marijuana is legal in Las Vegas.
[251:30.07]Don't overdo it.
[251:31.63]You know, if you're of age and, you know, something that you feel like doing, just be safe about it.
[251:39.70]And don't do it all the time.
[251:40.64]Do it, you know, sometimes.
[251:42.16]Don't be pressured to fucking do anything like that.
[251:49.50]Same thing with alcohol.
[251:50.30]Do it the same way.
[251:57.59]Where's my pizza?
[251:58.31]What?
[251:58.57]You didn't show up to... Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[252:00.87]Where's my pizza?
[252:08.35]Why would I be enemies with this person?
[252:14.49]I ordered a pizza and made a... I... What are you doing?
[252:21.73]I microwaved a pastry and I ordered... That's what you ate instead.
[252:28.99]That's the person that wanted to take your money.
[252:31.81]Really?
[252:35.17]Oh.
[252:36.59]Interesting.
[252:47.06]I don't have this person on my social list.
[252:53.15]Oh.
[252:56.49]What happened with Santa?
[253:00.79]Well, I'll give you a quick TL;DR in case you don't want to watch the VOD or watch these streams.
[253:04.95]Santa and I, we had a big Christmas party.
[253:08.48]Yes, this is yesterday's stream.
[253:09.94]Had a big Christmas party.
[253:10.92]A bunch of people came over.
[253:12.22]We had a bunch of fun.
[253:14.18]We sang a bunch of Christmas songs.
[253:15.44]Santa showed up.
[253:16.72]And I thought Santa was trying to shoot me with a gun.
[253:20.10]And I freaked out about it.
[253:21.44]And then I got mad at him.
[253:23.76]And...
[253:25.79]Um,
[253:27.73]I ended up... We ended up having a... We hashed it out.
[253:31.78]And we went on vacation to Star Wars Land.
[253:34.48]And everything was perfectly fine.
[253:36.60]Everything was very normal.
[253:38.78]This was not a problem.
[253:39.88]It was like, we're at Star Wars Land.
[253:41.02]We're having a good time.
[253:41.94]We split up.
[253:42.54]I became part of the First Order, which is like, I mean, like, PogChamp.
[253:45.56]And Santa did some... Dressed up as a stormtrooper and was just kind of eating at the restaurants and stuff.
[253:52.99]It was cool.
[253:53.31]It was fine.
[253:54.23]At the very end of the trip, before leaving...
[253:56.77]Santa attacked me.
[253:59.49]Or no, I don't know why.
[254:00.47]I actually don't have any idea why.
[254:01.97]I don't, can somebody, actually, this is like not a joke or we're not fucking around.
[254:05.56]Why did Santa attack me at the end of the vacation?
[254:11.98]Then we became enemies.
[254:13.64]You checked his ID and it was fake, so he fought you.
[254:16.28]You tried to turn him into the First Order.
[254:20.51]Alright, but we're at Star Wars land, dude.
[254:23.03]Really?
[254:23.25]Really?
[254:25.73]They give us badges to what do you want to do.
[254:28.37]Oh, I want to pretend to be in the First Order.
[254:30.15]I want to be in the Rebel Alliance.
[254:32.17]You don't take it that seriously.
[254:35.15]It's like, dude, we like played a game of Among Us and I caught you as the imposter and you stopped talking to me on Discord.
[254:42.85]Like, come on.
[254:44.49]So...
[254:46.94]Eventually, it got to the point where, you know, I wanted to hash it out at this party that we went to.
[254:54.10]And just said, kind of, fuck it, he was pissing me off.
[254:57.27]And he said a bunch of mean shit about me, so I took out my lightsaber and I fucking slashed him.
[255:08.27]Why am I microwaving food?
[255:11.62]Oh no.
[255:13.00]Oh no.
[255:22.04]Okay, so I'm eating too many pieces of cake and microwaved food.
[255:28.21]This is what I get for eating all that cake.
[255:31.45]Every day.
[255:31.81]Alright, what do you want me to do?
[255:38.77]Okay, watch TV.
[255:40.42]Yep, turn on the TV.
[255:42.60]Watch, um, I don't know, whatever.
[255:44.80]Watch the kids network.
[255:47.48]You want to hear the kids music.
[255:51.45]And I want to flirt with Bako.
[255:59.61]Okay.
[256:02.47]How do I get a hold of Bako?
[256:09.08]Okay, that was fulfilled.
[256:10.84]Listen to kids music.
[256:18.33]You want to watch kids TV and kids music.
[256:27.73]Go dance to it.
[256:28.41]The jams are on now.
[256:41.55]I'm doing it.
[256:57.21]That actually scared the shit out of me.
[257:11.07]How many hours do I have to listen to this before he's happy about it?
[257:19.34]Who's outside?
[257:20.16]Is there somebody outside?
[257:27.64]I don't think so.
[257:28.84]Somebody said this looks like a hotel room.
[257:34.00]What's your favorite stoner?
[257:36.20]Well, let's not use the term stoner.
[257:38.13]I partake sparingly.
[257:44.45]I have a really, really embarrassing confession to tell everybody here.
[257:47.57]Remember when I talked a ton of shit about Takis and I was like, these things are disgusting.
[257:54.48]They just taste like acid and they're the
[257:58.05]Oh, the music sped up.
[257:59.25]I heard like... I was like, why am I getting stabbed?
[258:09.88]But anyways, yeah.
[258:11.50]So... Takis... I feel like they're this weird thing where I ate one one time.
[258:19.28]And I had never really eaten them before.
[258:20.57]I said, these are gross.
[258:23.23]I don't like these.
[258:24.31]I'm never going to buy these again.
[258:27.10]I said that for real.
[258:29.34]I don't like these.
[258:30.36]I'm never buying these again.
[258:34.12]Maybe six months later, I just saw them in the grocery store and did this weird, like, ironic, I'm gonna buy them.
[258:43.55]Because it's ironic and funny.
[258:48.15]So I bought a bag of them.
[258:51.09]And I eat them all the time now.
[258:56.33]What happened?
[259:04.55]So I don't know why.
[259:05.56]Your pizza is in the mailbox?
[259:13.98]Elderly dog.
[259:19.69]What the fuck?
[259:25.17]Why?

[259:34.11]You, like, prankster.
[259:37.28]That's some prankster shit.

[261:41.46]You strange, strange man.
[261:43.38]Does my breath stink?
[262:03.04]That's a lot of vomit faces.
[262:04.92]Okay.
[262:09.91]I don't think I'm ever gonna get promoted.
[262:38.17]I'm just getting into that.
[262:41.45]Discuss fears.
[262:44.01]Listen to lullabies.
[262:44.93]You got it.
[262:53.55]Volume's on really high.
[263:04.19]This...
[263:08.11]I feel like this is a MrBeast video.
[263:14.06]Playing this music really loud and you have to try to sleep the whole night through it or something.
[263:19.28]Okay, that's good.
[263:41.84]Ah, sorry.
[263:44.51]Sorry.
[263:45.35]You left the circle where the bed was.
[263:46.79]You don't get the $100,000.
[263:49.25]Is this NPR music?
[263:49.91]What?
[263:52.35]What?
[264:13.32]How is this NPR music?
[264:25.47]He fell asleep in the chair.
[264:26.63]Alright, did I listen to the lullabies?
[264:31.80]Enough.
[264:46.22]In case he eats it.
[264:47.16]I'm just gonna poison this piece and leave.
[264:50.58]It already is poisoned.
[264:59.38]I just... Oh, I can't eat it.
[265:19.13]Oh, grab a poisoned serving.
[265:24.60]Throw it away.
[265:25.14]Oh, wait.
[265:26.84]The dog won't eat it, right?
[265:28.56]Get rid of it.
[265:36.73]I turned this off.
[265:45.21]What time is work?
[265:50.00]I actually have excellent performance right now.
[265:53.18]I actually might get promoted.
[265:55.38]One more day to see if I can do this.
[266:05.39]I'm hungry though.
[266:10.96]There's so many things that smell in here.
[266:12.82]The house is filling with gas.
[266:24.12]How are you doing?
[266:26.71]Uh, need to go out?
[266:31.05]This is still full, right?
[266:31.91]Yep.
[266:33.71]Clean the hell up.
[266:37.21]I remade.
[266:37.71]Dude, I have 1500 bucks to my name.
[266:40.33]I'm gonna lose all that money.
[266:50.37]Brush.
[266:51.93]And then give a big treat.
[266:54.26]And then I'm gonna make a big treat too.
[266:55.87]By microwaving... a microwave dinner.
[267:10.24]Where you going?
[267:27.52]Oh, she's so slow.
[267:30.00]She's perfect.
[267:42.52]A big treat.
[267:45.08]I come into a weird realization.
[267:55.93]The dog eats better than I do.
[268:37.98]Not enthusiastic about it anymore.
[268:42.40]He's just doing it because I told him to.
[268:45.24]Look at this.
[268:45.56]He doesn't even want to do this.
[268:54.86]Ow!
[268:55.80]Ow, that hurt!
[268:56.86]Somebody said this is really depressing.
[269:07.38]Microwaving a dinner and flossing is like actually kind of sad like that's sad This is like actually depressing He won't even eat it This that the the the nonchalant not caring floss I got my microwave dinner and
[269:37.32]That was so sad.
[269:38.62]Oh.
[269:38.68]Discofa.
[269:42.64]Oh.
[269:53.90]It's like he was so enthusiastic months and months ago about doing the floss when he has a delicious meal.
[269:59.86]And it's almost like he's doing it because it feels like he has to now.
[270:03.47]Not because he wants to.
[270:04.43]It's just like, I feel like I have to.
[270:05.69]This is what I do, man.
[270:06.77]I make my dinner and I do the floss.
[270:09.39]I guess.
[270:10.87]That was so fucking funny.
[270:12.47]It was so awful.
[270:14.84]He's clearly had enough.
[270:16.18]Yeah.
[270:22.16]I could probably eat the dog food and be healthier.
[270:34.92]I already was single and loving it.
[270:38.16]That already was unlocked.
[270:41.31]Alright, it's time to go to work in excellent condition.
[270:44.19]Need to go to the bathroom, brush my teeth, and we'll go.

[272:27.02]It's my dream to listen to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star every single day of my life.

[272:34.42]That's a weird dream.

[273:30.51]Buy a business.
[273:31.47]I have $1,700.
[273:43.26]I didn't... He's still eating microwaved food and just desserts every day.
[273:48.82]No wonder he's so fucked up.
[273:51.42]No wonder he's got something wrong.
[273:53.52]I need to get... Clean out the fridge.

[275:45.69]Jeremy, you're in the biggest nerd job ever.
[275:51.01]True.
[275:52.95]But mind does not require you to be intelligent.
[275:56.70]So there's a big difference.
[276:01.00]In fact, it's the complete opposite, I would say.
[276:10.15]Whoa!

[280:48.37]Alright.
[280:49.79]I'm telling you, I kind of, I kind of get this.

[280:59.99]Right?
[281:02.28]Like, cleaning something really gross, I would want to be just in underwear.
[281:05.49]And just only underwear.
[281:07.67]And then get right in the shower.
[281:08.71]I feel like I would get in all of my clothes and stuff.

[383:56.06]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[384:00.10]We'll play a couple things on Friday.
[384:06.89]Maybe... I don't know.
[384:10.99]I think I'm going to play Multiversus.
[384:13.47]I think Warner Brothers is going to sponsor it, which is just sick.
[384:18.96]They've added a ton of shit, so we'll probably play that for a couple of hours.
[384:23.64]And we'll do something else, too.
[384:28.92]I tell you, I definitely cannot play The Sims mods during that stream.
[384:34.31]I don't think so.
[384:36.87]But we'll stream for like five or six hours on Friday.
[384:42.20]We'll start with something and then move to it at the end of the stream.
[384:50.48]There's like four new characters.
[384:54.06]I'll see you Friday.
[384:56.18]Starting at early.
[384:59.89]Early, right?
[385:00.75]Because I have to.
[385:05.11]Because, wait, what time is it?
[385:07.21]It is exactly 7.30, and I just dropped frames right now.
[385:12.96]I just saw it.
[385:14.42]So, perfect timing.
[385:16.60]So, I'll be starting somewhere probably around, like, same area from 1 o'clock.
[385:23.52]1 o'clock Pacific.
[385:28.88]Thanks for watching.
[385:29.34]That was kind of, that was a crazy one.
[385:32.83]Playing this game with mods is always an adventure.
[385:35.45]I'm glad we got to do... I'm glad I was alive for more than six hours.
[385:38.89]I'm happy the internet was fine.
[385:40.13]But we're going to have to stick to this schedule because I will not be able to do it.
[385:46.56]I won't be able to stream otherwise.
[385:48.54]So here's your new semi-permanent schedule.
[385:52.58]Like, starting at 1pm and stopping whenever within six-ish hours.
[386:03.28]So, see you Friday.
[386:07.02]Thanks for watching.
[386:13.39]And here are the credits.
[386:16.53]See you guys later.
[386:18.03]Take care of yourselves.
[386:27.18]What should we do on Friday?
[386:28.24]I'm trying to think.
[386:40.75]Frog Detective?
[386:41.73]Actually, that might not be a bad idea.
[386:58.74]I feel like Frog Detective can be done in two or three hours, right?
[387:03.82]Maybe.
[387:05.30]Or Breath of the Wild.
[387:05.96]Breath of the Wild is easy just to jump into.
[387:12.86]Thanks a lot for the subs.
[387:14.54]There was a lot of subs that came in.
[387:15.64]I really appreciate it.
[387:20.82]Thank you.
[387:25.88]Again, I want to make sure I make it clear again.
[387:27.54]I don't shout subs out anymore.
[387:31.50]Stopped doing that a couple years ago.
[387:35.33]And I've given the reasons a few times, but I really do appreciate it nonetheless.
[387:39.69]Thank you so much.
[387:52.26]It means a lot.
[388:04.05]Play Neon White?
[388:08.95]What's the reason?
[388:10.07]I'll go over it in 30 seconds.
[388:13.96]So, I wanted to remove
[388:18.89]I want to remove any incentive to giving money to the stream, essentially.
[388:24.38]And shouting out and thanking subs, especially ones where it's a lot.
[388:30.90]I just don't want to incentivize people to just dump tons and tons of subs and money into the stream and kind of...
[388:37.83]almost this is not what people are doing right but effectively I'm gonna say something about it right um people have been insanely generous to the stream over the years I wish I could say more than thank you but yeah I stopped reading uh donation messages I stopped doing notifications if you want to sub to the stream I appreciate it if you don't don't you don't have to uh I'd rather it be that way and we just kind of hang out
[389:07.22]then do it otherwise.
[389:08.66]Time's up.
[389:10.06]Okay, there you go.
[389:22.65]And people do still give a lot of subs and I wish there was more I could say than just thank you.
[389:26.45]That's an insane amount of money to give anybody.
[389:34.36]I have such attention problems, you guys already know it.
[389:37.54]Another reason too, which is not as big of a reason, but reading subnames and taking my eyes off, look at how much I can't pay attention already.
[389:52.26]It adds another layer of me losing kind of focus on what I'm looking at.
[389:58.20]And I already have those problems.
[390:04.84]Jeremiah, I said you had the biggest nerd job, but I meant it in a loving way.
[390:08.31]No, I know, I know.
[390:09.83]We fuck around a lot here, don't worry.
[390:12.19]I get it.
[390:18.79]But yeah, I'll see you guys on Friday.
[390:20.23]Have a great night.
[390:24.80]Take care of yourselves.
[390:26.46]And have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[390:28.72]See you guys on Friday.
[390:30.60]Take care.
[390:31.44]Call your mother.
[390:33.58]See you soon.
[390:41.53]Thank you.
[391:16.42]you
[391:47.67]you
