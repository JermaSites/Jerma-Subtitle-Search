[00:30.58]We're going to watch a trailer.
[00:32.00]I think this is a live action trailer.
[00:34.96]This was uploaded yesterday.
[00:35.94]Let me just tweet my tweet.
[00:41.69]Hey, there's a new sponsor tweet incoming.
[00:45.69]New sponsor tweet.
[00:46.82]Are you serious?
[00:47.74]Okay.
[00:55.02]Wait, hold on.
[00:58.27]What is this one?
[01:03.09]Hotel fridges are just freezers.
[01:05.51]Don't fuck around.
[01:06.73]That sandwich you put in there is going to turn into a Jimmy Dean's breakfast sandwich.
[01:11.64]That's pretty good.
[01:15.42]I'm just looking at my drafts right now.
[01:23.19]That's actually a pretty good one.
[01:29.57]Oh, he's dumping the drafts right now?
[01:31.65]No.
[01:34.28]Are these... No, they're not drunk tweets.
[01:42.69]Oh, this one's actually for... We'll go over this after the sponsor.
[01:45.63]Because this one, I got a story to tell you after this.
[01:49.59]Alright.
[01:57.66]Let me tweet this.
[01:59.16]Make sure it looks right.
[02:00.38]You tell me if it looks good on Twitter.
[02:03.17]Look at how active my Twitter is today.
[02:05.69]You see this activity?
[02:07.85]This is two, this is two or three tweets in one day.
[02:13.57]Look at me now.
[02:14.64]Look at what I'm doing.
[02:15.60]Look at me.
[02:17.40]Look at what I'm doing now.
[02:19.82]Actually using Twitter.
[02:21.54]Look at me.
[02:28.84]Okay.
[02:34.13]Looks pretty good.
[02:38.25]Looks pretty good.
[02:39.30]I'm just going to shut up.
[02:46.40]Everything work.
[02:53.01]The 34 seconds ago, shut up.
[02:57.91]Why OK?
[03:04.00]Alright, let's watch the trailer.
[03:05.10]This is the Final Fantasy 16 Requiem live action trailer.
[03:10.63]Actually, I've not seen this, so let's see.
[03:14.17]Turn the music off.
[03:15.41]Let's get comfortable.
[03:17.19]Let's get... I'm going to turn the lights off.
[03:26.46]Everything seems pretty solid.
[03:34.92]Oh, there we go.
[03:35.36]I just had to quit the game.
[03:37.32]Speak up.
[03:40.60]This is not it.
[03:42.33]I was still in the other game.
[03:43.47]Get out of this.
[03:51.03]Alright.
[03:53.29]It is time to watch the Final Fantasy 16 live action trailer.
[03:59.06]Thank you, by the way, Square Enix.
[04:02.44]and Final Fantasy 16, sponsoring the segment of the stream.
[04:10.40]You ready?
[04:13.08]I wonder how this is.
[04:21.01]Here we go.
[04:24.41]Oh my god!
[04:27.61]violence blood sexual themes nudity strong language alright okay are you guys ready to watch make sure the audio is in a good spot here we go
[05:15.05]Of course you walk by the blacksmith
[06:28.82]And we're just playing music.
[07:08.55]Okay.
[07:53.66]Oh shit Oh my god, he went flying he flew in there
[08:25.01]Alright.
[08:26.21]There it was.
[08:27.87]Final Fantasy 16.
[08:30.20]I've got a PS5 right now.
[08:33.02]Very excited.
[08:38.34]You ready to check out the demo?
[08:39.78]Let's fucking go.
[08:40.69]Alright.
[08:44.67]Bear with me for a second.
[08:45.71]I've never used a PlayStation.
[08:47.11]PlayStation.
[08:49.05]I hope I did all this right.
[08:51.17]I've never used a PlayStation 5.
[08:53.48]I've played it one time with Etalyx because you showed me that the trigger buttons are cool.
[08:58.66]Alright, let's go.
[09:03.36]See if I did this right.
[09:11.50]I think I did.
[09:17.24]Can you guys hear it?
[09:27.90]Wait, it's coming through my TV.
[09:30.56]Hold on, I gotta fix this.
[09:34.96]Alright, give me one second.
[09:35.58]It's coming through my TV.
[09:37.55]It's not coming through my headphones.
[09:40.99]Can you hear the music?
[09:44.09]It's like playing the intro.
[09:47.77]Alright, hold on.
[09:48.51]I gotta move this.
[09:50.47]Why is it playing through my TV?
[09:51.52]Wait.
[10:01.77]There we go.
[10:02.17]Now I can hear it.
[10:13.26]Noise?
[10:13.60]What do you mean worse noise?
[10:19.08]Alright.
[10:20.06]Here we go.
[10:20.56]It's time.
[10:22.62]Square Enix.
[10:30.83]Square Enix.
[10:35.92]I do have to do this, though.
[10:44.25]Alright, progress is saved automatically.
[10:45.67]This demo features several chapters of Final Fantasy XVI's first act.
[10:49.32]All saved progress can be carried over to the main game.
[10:52.04]We hope you enjoy your time in Valistia.
[10:56.56]That's actually pretty good.
[10:57.72]That's cool.
[10:59.91]I'm glad you can actually save your progress.
[11:02.77]Also, if you don't know, Final Fantasy 16, you don't need to know 15 games worth of story.
[11:10.96]I think that's pretty obvious at this point.
[11:15.40]Otherwise, I don't know if I would have wanted to play.
[11:20.11]Every single story for Final Fantasy, with the exception of a few, is different.
[11:24.39]This one is no different.
[11:28.07]Alright, subtitles going to stay on, vibrations going to keep it on.
[11:31.13]What about brightness?
[11:31.85]Does this look good?
[11:33.51]A bit more?
[11:33.87]What do you guys think?
[11:40.74]I think it's good right where it was.
[11:43.18]Game performance, graphics or frame rate?
[11:45.28]I don't know.
[11:45.96]I don't know what really what this means.
[11:47.40]I have a PS5.
[11:48.82]Should I do graphics or frame rate?
[11:52.03]Maybe graphics.
[11:53.83]Frame rate?
[11:58.29]Uh, this is probably fine.
[12:04.43]Story focused or action focused?
[12:06.99]Gameplay focus does not affect story content.
[12:09.13]Mode can be changed after starting game.
[12:10.71]Alright.
[12:11.23]So we're doing action, of course.
[12:12.19]Okay.
[12:17.49]Screen brightness five.
[12:18.67]This is all sounds pretty good.
[12:20.53]Subtitles are on.
[12:23.84]Okay.
[12:28.37]It was Moss the Chronicler who said that the land of Alesthea is blessed in the light of the Mother Crystals.
[12:40.57]And that it was this light which finally led our forebears out of the darkness.
[12:46.07]Creative Business Unit 3.
[12:47.55]Yet, what they saw in the light gave rise to temptation.
[12:54.96]Temptation that ever lures us back into the crystal shadow.
[13:01.32]And thus did our journey begin.
[13:04.72]Oh, that Final Fantasy soundtrack is already bumping.
[13:13.67]What just happened?
[13:51.29]Fireball?
[13:52.47]Wait, I have to evade.
[13:53.33]I'm playing the game now.
[13:57.36]Just spam fireball.
[14:07.68]Evade.
[14:08.68]Did I do it?
[14:11.70]Got this bird mode.
[14:12.58]I think I have to time it.
[14:22.78]There it is.
[14:40.45]PS5 looks pretty good.
[15:00.90]Three-year-old console?
[15:02.30]Yeah, I mean, I have never seen it before.
[15:12.53]Year of the Realm, 873.
[15:13.19]Uh, nice, uh...
[15:36.36]So what character am I?
[15:38.14]Do I choose one or do I?
[15:44.17]You all know the target.
[15:46.37]Shiva's dominant.
[15:48.87]And only the dominant.
[15:51.93]No one else.
[15:54.37]Where's the fun in that?
[15:58.31]It's me, right?
[15:59.15]The girl will be among them.
[16:01.03]Our kind do not question orders.
[16:04.08]We follow them.
[16:06.23]Try to keep that in mind.
[16:13.99]Let's get this done.
[16:16.85]Yeah, I can't wait.
[16:18.01]I hope that.
[16:20.13]Makes an appearance.
[16:21.68]True got through.
[16:41.86]So from my understanding, this game is different than the other one.
[16:46.97]It's not turn based.
[16:48.41]It's like action based, right?
[16:57.31]I'm very curious what that means.
[17:01.64]Okay Final Fantasy hasn't been turn-based in, like, a decade?
[17:18.41]Okay Alright Fly Look at the- wait that- look- oop
[17:30.35]the main menu.
[17:31.59]Press whatever that button is at any time outside a cutscene to open the main menu.
[17:37.00]Gameplay configuration settings including camera inversion can also be adjusted on the system tab.
[17:43.06]We don't have time for this.
[17:44.53]All hell is about to break loose.
[17:46.19]I want to look at the scenery.
[17:54.81]Looks pretty good.
[18:00.06]Is there a run?
[18:06.49]Alright, tilt gently to walk.
[18:09.47]There we go.
[18:10.79]Jump.
[18:14.17]You can move faster if you do this.
[18:18.23]Do it gently?
[18:25.17]Do we get to fight all that?
[18:31.35]Republican army front line.
[18:36.75]Turned it up.
[18:56.16]Am I going to fight in a big fucking battle?
[19:15.46]Turn it up now and now it's too quiet.
[19:19.46]I can't wait to go.
[19:44.49]stronghold alright quickly move what do you mean you refuse we refuse did you not pledge your swords to our cause oh new new characters come now marshall the king of wulud is our guest
[20:17.15]And you have his Majesty's answer.
[20:26.88]Damn it.
[20:30.28]There's a huge ass table.
[20:36.50]You can't do much at a table like that.
[20:46.80]What was that?
[20:51.85]I wonder that you summoned us at all.
[20:53.85]Cigarette stream.
[20:54.67]Vape?
[20:54.89]Have you so little faith in your own men?
[21:01.29]It was the Dalmix who drove back the Crusaders in the Battle of the Twin Realms, was it not?
[21:09.53]Or am I mistaken?
[21:13.53]Besides...
[21:16.87]Your dominant has yet to take the field.
[21:23.42]And when he does, our knights would only get in the way.
[21:29.12]Perhaps you have not heard, but the Ironblood now have their own dominant.
[21:34.09]We would be fools to underestimate them.
[21:36.39]Bugger their knights.
[21:37.69]What did you say?
[21:42.13]Should this citadel be allowed to fall?
[21:46.82]This guy's fucking huge.
[21:50.14]He's like eight people.
[21:52.00]Okay, I did not know how big this guy was until he stepped forward.
[21:54.16]Why?
[21:54.36]That was... That's so rude.
[22:16.51]The Ironblood will rule the day they set foot on Storm.
[22:24.02]This game is over.
[22:42.74]Alright, so whose ass do I have to kick?
[22:44.64]You cock.
[22:51.79]Benedicta.
[23:00.41]Take care.
[23:02.73]Does the lion take care when he chases the hare?
[23:06.96]Or do you think me one of the latter?
[23:09.20]No, my love.
[23:11.32]You are a lion.
[23:13.50]You're my lion.
[23:15.00]I'm not afraid of a little frost, Benedicta.
[23:21.05]But I will need time to warm me when I come home.
[23:32.65]Do I have to kick that guy's ass?
[23:40.77]The front lines are gone.
[23:42.49]18 plus and smoking.
[23:45.09]The chaos will conceal us.
[23:47.87]Alright cool.
[23:48.39]OK.
[24:15.77]What's the first thing I got?
[24:16.69]You gotta give me like a skeleton to kill, right?
[24:19.71]One skeleton is going to be like... Clive!
[24:24.25]Be careful!
[24:25.09]That skeleton will take you down in one swing!
[24:31.73]Come on, there's always a singular skeleton.
[24:37.55]And?
[24:38.09]Quick and deadly.
[24:39.29]As always.
[24:43.39]Take the van.
[24:52.16]Remember when we talked about what it would sound like if I had everyone- if I could hear everybody on the stream?
[24:56.82]I feel like it would sound like- well, not like that.
[25:07.47]Oh shit.
[25:13.29]What is that fucking thing?
[25:16.99]There's the one skeleton!
[25:20.42]No, that's quite the one skeleton for the tutorial.
[25:23.64]Alright, I turned it up, so it's going to be loud.
[25:40.77]We're enjoying it.
[25:41.89]Just be aware, the volume, you should adjust your volume.
[25:47.87]I turned it up.
[25:53.87]Wait, are those chocobos?
[26:17.83]Cool.
[26:41.25]I thought he was making that sound with his mouth.
[26:45.83]Maybe he was.
[27:08.55]I have to move.
[27:10.33]There's a dash.
[27:12.55]You don't get to die here Wyvern.
[27:14.27]Move!
[27:18.93]Let's go!
[27:19.62]Move!
[27:20.14]Uh oh.
[27:36.58]Oh, God.
[27:37.90]Wait, is this a... Is that person bad?
[27:40.27]Okay, I think that person's bad.
[27:42.67]Who's on... What team am I on?
[27:43.91]I don't know what team I'm on.
[27:46.55]Am I on Team Ice or Team Big Gigantic Guy?
[27:51.92]It's hard to tell.
[27:52.56]Okay.
[28:00.92]Alright, I'm liking this more and more as we go.
[28:15.06]That's what I would say in that situation.
[28:16.86]Oh, 100%.
[28:39.95]I'm glad that they're doing that instead of being like, oh, whoa, better look out.
[28:44.85]No, you'd be like, fuck, fuck, please help me.
[28:47.21]Please, God, help me.
[28:52.76]What the?
[28:53.76]Oh, shit, that guy got crushed.
[29:03.14]Oh, that's not good.
[29:05.08]Wyvern, Wyvern.
[29:18.51]I told you before, you do not get to die here.
[29:21.36]That's pretty awful.
[29:32.42]Oh.
[29:39.07]Clive!
[29:41.07]Get up, Clive!
[29:51.98]now we're probably gonna see some 13 summers earlier okay well if you're not cut out to be a shield there's always work for you in the stables unless of course you think you can defend your master while sat on your ass in a puddle of pig's will
[30:17.18]I'm sure he'd find a way.
[30:18.36]My brother always looks after me, right?
[30:22.82]Go on, you're sure to hit him eventually.
[30:24.77]Don't give up now.
[30:28.09]Dog.
[30:36.48]I was going to say it's definitely a wooden sword.
[30:39.22]Wouldn't do to disappoint the gallery.
[30:41.20]Alright, wooden sword training.
[30:42.90]Here we go.
[30:53.05]Oh.
[30:53.25]Alright.
[30:55.94]Attack the Lord Commander.
[31:01.84]So, square to perform melee attack.
[31:03.70]Up to four attacks can be chained together.
[31:05.02]So, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[31:10.19]Okay.
[31:10.39]There is a lock on.
[31:14.97]Is there a dodge roll?
[31:22.94]Very good.
[31:25.90]Such swordsmanship will serve you well in the field.
[31:28.88]But can the same be said of your spellcraft?
[31:32.02]The flames of the phoenix burn within you.
[31:34.98]Now let them burn without.
[31:36.70]You're an iframe crackhead.
[31:38.58]Come, Clive.
[31:40.64]Bring fire down upon me.
[31:43.37]Yeah, I kind of am.
[31:44.71]Okay.
[31:48.77]Triangle to cast fire, a ranged spell that can strike enemies from great distances.
[31:52.29]Okay.
[31:53.97]Keep them coming.
[31:57.56]I wonder if you can be like a mage.
[32:08.70]Well done.
[32:09.27]You wield the Firebird's flames just as a first shield should.
[32:16.01]You flatter me, my lord.
[32:18.63]Plus one full letter grade incoming.
[32:23.32]Stay quick on your feet.
[32:24.10]Evade four times.
[32:25.30]R1 to evade an enemy's attack.
[32:44.70]Evading an attack at the precise moment it is dealt will temporarily slow the enemy, making it more susceptible to a counter.
[32:50.81]Alright.
[32:53.01]Cool.
[32:54.93]Because I'm a gamer.
[33:16.24]Okay.
[33:16.62]Remember, Clive, your blade is not your only weapon.
[33:20.56]Use your... Oh.
[33:22.10]Use your voice and your intelligence to get out of issues.
[33:30.33]Show me what sets you apart from the rest.
[33:33.25]You have been blessed by the Phoenix.
[33:36.05]Granted the use of its power.
[33:38.85]Call upon that power now to close on me.
[33:41.07]Okay.
[33:43.70]Well, I'm waiting.
[33:47.45]Close the gap.
[33:50.97]The Blessing of the Phoenix grants Clive the ability to perform feats of inhuman strength and dexterity.
[33:57.12]Phoenix Shift is one such... iconic feat?
[34:02.30]Press Circle to swiftly close in on a distant target.
[34:07.29]And both melee and ranged attacks can be used while executing a Phoenix Shift.
[34:11.73]Alright, so, like... Well, then all our shields could move so swiftly.
[34:20.08]Okay.
[34:20.80]So it's like a super dodge.
[34:25.39]Okay.
[34:49.93]Healing menu, I'm imagining use potions.
[35:02.75]Consumable items such as potions and tonics can be used to restore Clive's HP or temporarily boost attributes.
[35:09.71]Consumables can be assigned to up, right, down via the items tab in the main menu for a quick and convenient use.
[35:18.70]These items can be also used directly from the menu.
[35:20.34]Okay.
[35:21.26]So I imagine this probably... I'm just trying not to burp it.
[35:25.30]I'm trying to keep it in.
[35:26.04]Okay.
[35:28.60]Okay.
[35:30.83]So you can assign stuff, but I already have potion.
[35:34.00]Here it is.
[35:36.00]You can really spam it too.
[35:37.06]Okay.
[35:38.76]That's better.
[35:41.42]Battle is a succession of pivotal moments where in life and death can be decided at a single stroke.
[35:49.12]You thought I was doing a funny voice?
[35:50.02]You must be ready to utilize every tool at your disposal if you are to navigate a path to victory.
[35:56.46]Or at the very least, to ensure that you live to fight another day.
[36:02.17]Enough practice.
[36:04.23]It's time for the test.
[36:05.35]I'm going to stop this guy.
[36:06.25]You've recovered from your soaking, I trust.
[36:08.93]You wouldn't want to kick a man while he's drowned.
[36:11.13]I thought you'd never ask.
[36:14.75]Come then, Lord Rossfield.
[36:16.78]Spar with me.
[36:18.16]If you believe yourself worthy to be called Shield of the Flame, then prove it.
[36:24.20]As you wish, my lord.
[36:25.48]So much stronger than you.
[36:26.35]So much better than you.
[36:27.27]And so much older than you.
[36:28.27]And so much more wise than... Well done, boy.
[36:32.95]Well done.
[36:35.59]Ooh, music.
[36:40.85]The will gauge indicates an opponent's will to fight back.
[36:44.05]Break their spirit by landing attacks and strike them when they are vulnerable.
[36:48.91]Hmm, okay.
[36:51.10]Alright, back it up.
[36:53.56]Okay.
[36:53.86]Jump.
[37:23.74]This is, oh, staggering your enemies.
[37:27.08]Lord Murdock's will has been broken, leaving him staggered.
[37:30.72]Try dealing as much damage as you can before he regains his senses.
[37:33.59]Use R2 plus square to execute rising flames, a powerful, iconic ability.
[37:38.07]Okay, so when they're down, go wham.
[37:49.34]Cool.
[37:49.56]Oh, let's go!
[38:32.43]I probably would rebind.
[38:33.73]Probably going to rebind circle to dodge.
[38:37.19]And R1 to be that move.
[38:39.33]Just burned in my brain that circle was always just dodge.
[38:42.61]It's taken me long enough.
[38:48.09]That was a display worthy of your father.
[38:50.53]There's already an option for that, okay.
[38:52.35]You are a true shield of the flame and let no one tell you otherwise.
[38:57.51]Including me.
[39:01.65]What are you, Lone Corpia?
[39:03.55]Back to your drills.
[39:16.06]I was watching the VOD.
[39:17.12]Meanwhile, you're live.
[39:18.02]We're live right now with Final Fantasy 16.
[39:21.80]The demo.
[39:33.79]Do you think that hurt?
[39:36.47]I was just tired.
[39:37.16]The Phoenix's flames are a gift.
[39:40.60]You mustn't waste them.
[39:41.64]I wonder how the party system will be in this game.
[39:44.44]Will it be party space?
[39:45.24]Do you swap between characters or just play as one character?
[39:49.58]I wonder.
[39:49.98]I'm curious.
[40:10.68]Your Grace, please.
[40:12.28]This is no place for one such as you.
[40:14.28]Your Grace.
[40:14.78]I would gladly brave hell itself to see my darling boy.
[40:18.68]Okay.
[40:22.22]Gentlemen, Rosaria thanks you for your indefatigable loyalty.
[40:25.58]They confirmed it's party based.
[40:26.86]Okay, cool.
[40:27.42]Thank you, Your Grace.
[40:29.06]We live to serve.
[40:36.21]Joshua.
[40:41.14]You should not be out of doors.
[40:43.52]We have discussed this.
[40:45.95]I'm sorry.
[40:50.95]Good day to you, Mother.
[41:00.88]Come, Joshua.
[41:02.58]Your father will be expecting us.
[41:05.04]Leather noise.
[41:07.28]Yeah, the leather noise like... Lord Murdock.
[41:12.34]Your Grace.
[41:23.37]That was way worse.
[41:24.95]What a way to treat your own flesh and blood.
[41:28.49]I know.
[41:28.83]It's not his fault.
[41:31.49]Not everyone can be born the Phoenix.
[41:34.82]You should just wear a big leather coat one day.
[41:38.02]I don't think I want to do that in Las Vegas.
[41:40.93]That does not sound fun.
[41:55.04]Yeah, I've got a great idea.
[41:55.94]What is it, 120 degrees outside?
[41:57.98]Yeah, give me a big leather coat.
[42:14.76]That's a regal, a regal chocobo.
[42:17.24]Look at how regal that chocobo is walking.
[42:33.58]Rise, my friends.
[42:39.50]Welcome home, father.
[42:42.54]Thank you, Joshua.
[42:43.90]Would I look good in red?
[42:44.90]You are well, I trust.
[42:46.62]What do you guys think?
[42:47.22]Yes, father.
[42:48.23]Much better.
[42:49.05]I don't know.
[42:49.65]I don't think I can pull red off.
[42:54.15]Is that so?
[42:59.69]Yeah, I'm definitely more of a blue, gray.
[43:02.59]Purple.
[43:04.37]I like purple, too.
[43:05.17]Father.
[43:11.74]Lift up your head, girl.
[43:14.64]Thank you, Your Grace.
[43:20.21]You were in red for that show you were in the other week.
[43:22.49]The capital rejoices at your safe return, Your Grace.
[43:25.93]That was a puzzler, though.
[43:29.98]War is coming, my boy.
[43:31.96]You must make ready.
[43:35.82]That didn't even hurt.
[43:36.78]Your Grace.
[44:00.61]What does Your Grace mean?
[44:03.61]Your Grace.
[44:04.57]Does that mean like your- I find you to be- your very like- your right? And... Your Grace, Your Honor.
[44:15.62]Like it's my honor to be in your presence or something.
[44:20.90]What does it mean?
[44:24.37]Your Grace, your honor.
[44:31.25]It's like bowing.
[44:32.13]Okay, yeah.
[44:37.02]They were considered holy, God's Grace.
[44:38.74]Okay, yeah, that makes sense.
[44:41.58]Okay, should you find yourself lost, do not fret.
[44:43.22]Hold down L3 and trust in your animal instinct to point you in the right direction.
[44:49.04]Your current destination will be displayed.
[44:51.05]Alright, yeah.
[44:51.51]Don't worry, I know where we're going.
[44:54.21]I will tell you though, if me and Holly were ever lost...
[44:58.55]And I looked over, and I said, hey, don't worry, honey.
[45:01.67]We'll just trust my animal instinct.
[45:03.01]We'll get there.
[45:05.35]I don't know if we'll get there or not.
[45:10.46]I just start, like, sniffing.
[45:12.82]Wait, where are you going?
[45:15.02]Okay, cool.
[45:16.76]So, let's see.
[45:19.07]I'm not sure.
[45:20.39]I need to speak with Father.
[45:23.26]What's this?
[45:30.66]Secret!
[45:31.68]Useful items can be found across the realm by those who know where to look.
[45:33.90]Okay.
[45:35.93]What is this?
[45:37.13]A potion.
[45:38.01]Should I walk?
[45:45.51]We should probably RP walk, right?
[45:48.41]Make for the throne room.
[45:54.55]Just skipping to the throne room.
[45:56.17]I actually kind of like moving around like this.
[46:19.03]Would anybody be like, hey!
[46:20.99]Stop doing that.
[46:22.05]Stop skiffing.
[46:24.23]Stop having so much fun, Clive.
[46:33.22]What do you think you're doing?
[46:48.21]Good as new.
[46:51.03]Your Grace, you just put more bacteria on it and got it kind of dirty too.
[46:56.75]Why do people keep doing that?
[46:58.75]It doesn't do anything.
[47:04.79]It was no trouble, really.
[47:07.45]Imagine seeing your lord just skipping around through town.
[47:36.83]I'd be like, alright, at least he's happy.
[47:39.15]At least the Lord is happy.
[47:40.87]I trust his good fortune will continue.
[47:44.12]Of course, if that is your lordship's wish.
[47:50.16]Don't work too hard.
[47:51.84]Remember, it is for the good of the duchy that you serve.
[47:54.90]There goes the baker with the tray of... As do we all, my lord.
[48:03.85]As do we all.
[48:07.69]Come along now.
[48:09.15]Back to your duties.
[48:10.55]Yeah.
[48:39.64]Get back to what you were doing.
[48:41.70]And by the way, it's always Lord.
[48:46.10]Good day.
[48:46.46]Looks like they're getting ready for supper.
[48:53.78]I think someone's hungry.
[48:57.88]I've seen a lot of minus dudes.
[49:00.32]It's always Lord?
[49:01.96]What kind of dialogue was that?
[49:04.36]By the way, it's always Lord.
[49:06.81]Yeah, no, that's what they called him.
[49:08.11]That's literally what they said.
[49:09.03]Both said it.
[49:09.61]Why am I acting like they didn't say that?
[49:16.21]The optimal way to travel.
[49:22.97]Nice and quiet in here, isn't it?
[49:24.90]Oh, I just love the flower.
[49:27.20]There's Joshua.
[49:31.94]Does anybody else feel like they can skip faster than they can run?
[49:36.82]I really think I can.
[49:38.02]I think if I was in a full sprint versus a full skip, I would be able to do, I would go faster skipping.
[49:44.14]Oh no, am I?
[49:55.81]Some large gates and stiff levers require extra effort to operate.
[49:59.65]Use X to access them and then hold R2 to push.
[50:05.39]Oh, oops.
[50:07.77]Dude, this... Oh, this is weird.
[50:09.37]The PlayStation 5 has this... It's giving me... It's like feedback.
[50:18.41]I actually have to press this kind of, like, hard.
[50:25.02]Whoa, cool.
[50:27.14]Whoa.
[50:28.70]Whoa.
[50:33.82]Good luck.
[50:49.74]What's going on here?
[51:01.00]You commanded my presence, Your Grace.
[51:04.40]How may I serve you?
[51:07.96]Alright, you can stop licking my boots.
[51:10.35]Mother isn't here.
[51:14.89]Do the territories fare any better?
[51:20.39]Start skipping around.
[51:21.13]Most lie under a pall of black.
[51:24.55]In just these few moons, the Blight has taken nigh on all of the northern reaches.
[51:30.63]It is only a matter of time before it crosses the border.
[51:35.81]Pile of flames.
[51:38.28]Nearly every available bed in the capital is already occupied by those fleeing the Deadlands.
[51:43.86]Even if we were to send them south, to Port Isolde, more would only follow in their wake.
[51:50.91]Every day we delay brings us closer to disaster.
[51:54.81]We must move now.
[51:57.95]Against the Iron Kingdom.
[51:59.67]We have traded blows with them for too long.
[52:06.85]It is time to end it.
[52:09.72]At the very least, we must secure Drake's breath.
[52:14.28]Without the blessing of the Mother Crystal, we cannot defend our realm from the spread of the Blight.
[52:22.61]The iron blood will not relinquish it easily.
[52:25.17]This will be a bitter fight.
[52:28.47]We ride for Phoenix Gate tomorrow.
[52:31.40]There we will listen to the words of our ancestors as tradition dictates.
[52:36.66]Am I to go with you as Joshua Shield?
[52:39.76]There was no ergonomics back then.
[52:41.21]Rodney.
[52:46.82]And I feel like the first order of business for me would be, give me a pillow to put under my ass to sit on.
[52:50.74]You will have heard the reports, I'm sure, of beastmen from the north being sighted within our borders.
[52:56.11]Goblins in the Stillwind marshes.
[52:58.55]I know of the rumors, yes.
[53:00.63]Then you know what must be done.
[53:03.47]I'll give you two good men.
[53:04.57]The royal ass pillow.
[53:06.53]While we're at north tomorrow, you will will journey to Stillwind, search it and clear it.
[53:11.61]Then you will join us at Phoenix Gate.
[53:23.64]It is time to prove your strength.
[53:26.52]And shut your mother up for good.
[53:36.86]I will do my duty, Your Grace.
[53:39.87]Okay.
[53:41.35]Let's do it.
[53:44.15]I'm so ready.
[53:47.83]That will be all.
[53:49.13]Rest well.
[53:50.73]We ride at dawn.
[53:54.03]Yes, Your Grace.
[53:57.09]Yeah, again, this is the demo.
[53:59.81]Get it right now.
[54:00.71]PS5.
[54:04.97]Active Time Lore.
[54:08.05]Hold that to access the Active Time Lore feature, a compilation of important information relevant to Clive's current story progression.
[54:17.00]ATL can even be viewed during most cutscenes.
[54:22.51]What does that mean?
[54:24.87]Oh, okay.
[54:26.71]That's important people.
[54:28.21]This is actually good because I forget literally every single person's name.
[54:34.92]Okay, cool.
[54:40.82]Wait, did they actually add the caveman mode I was talking about?
[54:46.38]Is this in the game?
[54:47.78]Didn't I talk about how much I fucking wanted this so bad?
[54:50.82]How badly I wanted this?
[54:53.85]It's a paragraph to explain just... Here it is.
[54:55.97]Hey, look.
[54:57.19]Look, there's like three sentences.
[54:58.31]There's a lore button where you can just read like one small paragraph.
[55:05.07]Okay, I'm happy about that.
[55:15.90]Okay, retire to your chambers.
[55:21.78]Hey Dad!
[55:22.28]What do you think of my training?
[55:48.01]How do I get out of here?
[55:54.73]How do I get up there?
[55:59.23]Oh, this way.
[56:11.74]The castle's nice.
[56:16.28]Will you still be skipping as him 15 years later?
[56:19.94]That's a core part of my character's personality right now.
[56:24.10]You think I'm going to stop doing that?
[56:52.12]How long will you be away this time?
[56:55.72]Not long.
[56:57.68]Four days, maybe five.
[57:02.69]And you will be taking Joshua?
[57:05.42]Well, I can't exactly leave him behind, can I?
[57:09.61]The blood of the Rosfields runs in his veins.
[57:12.83]Let me ask, does the demo have a lot of, uh, casting stuff?
[57:16.19]Yeah, I think it's starting to build up the story.
[57:18.49]Only the dominant can enter the apothecary, so yes, I'm taking Joshua.
[57:23.19]Oh, to hell with your way!
[57:24.49]Your demo progress does carry on to the main game when it releases.
[57:28.21]I think I don't know that.
[57:31.37]But the boy is also the phoenix.
[57:35.22]The heir to the throne.
[57:38.46]You can't keep him in swaddling clothes all of his life.
[57:42.76]Elwynn!
[57:43.48]Don't worry.
[57:45.04]Clive will watch over him.
[57:47.82]Can you skip in the full game?
[57:48.80]He was a youth of but 15 years.
[57:51.13]He's already a fine soldier.
[57:53.09]He will make a splendid shield.
[57:55.07]Yes, you can.
[57:56.05]You see more in him than the Phoenix did.
[57:59.07]He was rejected, Elwynn.
[58:02.13]Our household has no place for such a failure.
[58:04.47]He is worthless.
[58:05.49]A man like any other.
[58:09.16]As am I, my dear.
[58:12.90]Nonsense.
[58:14.30]You are the Archduke of Rosaria.
[58:16.84]Not this again.
[58:20.16]You know as well as I do that I only sit upon the throne because my father was taken before his time.
[58:25.91]I am merely warming the seat till Joshua comes of age.
[58:33.07]You are your father's firstborn son.
[58:36.89]And you sit upon the throne.
[58:40.39]All is in its right place.
[58:43.67]Oh, here comes the sex thing.
[58:45.11]You have not disgraced our noble blood.
[58:49.46]Without men like Clive to keep us safe.
[58:50.84]He gave us a sexual warning.
[58:52.60]Your precious noble... Alright, who are these people?
[59:01.22]Look at how fucking perfect that thing really is.
[59:05.40]This is great.
[59:06.80]In the middle of the cutscene, I can be like, wait, okay, this is Annabelle of Rossfield, Duchess of Rosaria, wife of Archduke Elwynn, and mother to Clive and Joshua.
[59:16.69]Perfect.
[59:18.91]I know who this is now.
[59:20.57]Joshua Rossfield.
[59:22.78]Second son of the Archduke of Rosaria, Joshua was appointed heir to the Ducal throne by virtue of his awakening as the dominant of the Phoenix.
[59:31.41]His love... Actually, that's actually really cool.
[59:34.67]Let's go back to it now.
[59:36.18]Hold on a second.
[59:38.28]Pause it one more time.
[59:40.98]Don't let me be in charge of pausing anything.
[59:48.70]I'm imagining, and I know I'm just kind of, we're messing around here, but I'm imagining if you hear somebody say something or talk about something, you could just pause it and be like, wait, they said Rosalith Castle was out, right?
[60:00.41]Okay, that's this one.
[60:02.33]That's cool.
[60:08.13]That's cool.
[60:08.77]I like that.
[60:09.60]We have an early start.
[60:11.68]I'm going to sleep.
[60:22.18]Go back and read the queen's profile.
[60:24.14]Wait.
[60:28.87]Oh, it's whatever is currently in the frame?
[60:31.47]Is that how it works?
[60:34.87]Let me see.
[60:37.19]I think that's how it works.
[60:39.31]Wishing on a star.
[60:46.40]I'll talk about a couple things after this, too, because somebody brought this up, but I want to make sure I tell people this, because I feel like people that know this would go, oh, okay.
[61:00.46]Yeah, that's cool.
[61:01.24]Alright, so you... Born a princess of the Northern Territories, Jill was made a ward of Rosaria after her homeland's incessant raids were quelled by the... the... duchy?
[61:12.96]Duchy?
[61:14.59]She was raised in Rosalith Castle alongside Clive and Joshua, who came to love her as a sister.
[61:26.29]That's so helpful for me.
[61:33.66]You're going with them tomorrow, aren't you?
[61:38.44]I am Joshua's shield.
[61:40.96]I'm sworn to protect him.
[61:45.87]He takes too many risks.
[61:47.23]Jerma mode?
[61:48.53]I only wish I could save him from himself.
[61:50.51]You mean a good mode.
[61:52.46]Clive, you... I have another mission too.
[61:59.34]Father has given me my first command.
[62:04.42]What does command mean?
[62:08.28]He said a word I don't understand.
[62:09.34]Command?
[62:10.53]It's not here.
[62:13.49]Command?
[62:14.21]What's that mean?
[62:15.37]And I shall just have to do it for you.
[62:35.78]Dude's going to pull this off every cutscene now.
[62:38.04]I promise I'm not going to.
[62:39.30]There's going to be another war, isn't there?
[62:46.07]Since coming here, I've begun to take peace for granted.
[62:48.95]I assumed the war between our nations would be the last.
[62:57.10]But it never really ends, does it?
[63:03.68]No.
[63:10.07]The next war will be bigger than before.
[63:14.17]But you'll be alright, won't you Clive?
[63:16.50]You're a shield of Rosaria, after all... ...and blessed by the phoenix.
[63:37.15]It's getting cold.
[63:39.32]We should go in.
[63:41.78]My lady...
[63:47.96]Can you press the lower button to find out why it's cold?
[63:53.36]Alright, you press, you go like this.
[63:55.64]And it has like the forecast in the top right.
[63:59.08]It's chilly, 65 degrees at Rosalith Castle.
[64:01.54]Uh, northwest winds blowing at 15 miles per hour.
[64:07.51]That'd be cool.
[64:20.58]You broke your promise already.
[64:22.18]Well, that was the end of the cutscene.
[64:25.40]Also, do I have a second?
[64:26.12]Let's see.
[64:27.58]People were saying Devil May Cry.
[64:29.38]So, the combat director of this game, Ryota Suzuki, Ryota Suzuki, worked on Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma.
[64:40.45]So, that's the combat director of the game.
[64:42.89]Don't worry.
[64:59.98]Also, the director and producer of Final Fantasy XIV and the composer and sound director of Final Fantasy XIV also were on this.
[65:17.01]If that is perking your ears up a little, if you liked those games, I don't know.
[65:22.38]We'll see.
[65:22.58]Yeah, that's Yoshido.
[65:43.46]And Masayoshi Soken composed for the game.
[66:02.80]The combat director is interesting, though.
[66:07.02]I'm very curious how it actually plays out.
[66:10.17]fighting and battle scenarios.
[66:13.07]It's actually a dream team to make a Final Fantasy game.
[66:21.71]Sounds like it.
[66:26.64]We need some lore.
[66:40.60]Not today, we won't.
[66:42.26]Wait, we need to know who these people are.
[66:52.72]One of the stables of Rosalith Castle.
[66:55.32]Ambrosia was chosen by the young Clive Rossville to be his personal steed and raised by him from a chick.
[67:01.50]She is a proud bird and deeply loyal to her master, quickly turning her beak upon any but he who should attempt to pet her.
[67:12.68]They don't have lore because somebody said, I don't think they have lore because they're probably dead soon.
[67:23.11]Well, you don't know that.
[67:24.85]That's not why they don't have a lore card.
[67:26.49]Overworld map.
[67:41.08]The world map displays all the locations indicated by glowing pins currently available to Clive via fast travel.
[67:49.21]Okay.
[67:51.71]So we're going here.
[67:52.29]So this is Stillwind.
[67:55.72]Make for Stillwind.
[68:10.97]Those guys weren't as important as a bird.
[68:13.61]I think that bird's probably really important.
[68:26.28]No, I'm not gonna lore check.
[68:27.60]These guys don't have a lore card.
[68:30.40]Watch.
[68:33.40]Whoa, shit!
[68:35.60]Sir Wade!
[68:36.94]A loyal shield of Rosaria chosen by Lord Commander Rodney Murdoch to accompany Clive on his expedition to Stillwind.
[68:44.18]Once but a lowborn page, Wade was inspired to join the ranks after a woodpile fell on him, and his life was saved by a young Joshua.
[68:54.23]Okay, cool.
[68:54.91]What about you?
[68:56.03]A little bit more for Tyler here.
[69:01.79]a loyal shield of Rosaria and Sion of a noble family.
[69:05.29]Tyler followed in his father's footsteps in entering the service of the duchy, rising to the position of right-hand man to the Lord Commander.
[69:12.44]Okay.
[69:14.30]He was chosen by Lord Murdoch to accompany Clive on his expedition to Stillwind, a level head who could be trusted not only to obey the young lord's orders and keep him safe, but to help keep the fiery Sir Wade in line.
[69:26.84]Goblins.
[69:29.16]Goblins.
[69:32.45]We don't know anything, but I don't want to see that yet.
[69:33.67]Okay.
[69:33.77]Lost in a fog.
[69:34.11]Feeling overwhelmed?
[69:34.55]Try equipping one or more of the five timely accessories.
[70:02.48]For example, the Ring of Timely Strikes allows its wearer to chain complex attack combos only using square.
[70:09.83]The Ring of Timely Focus slows time before an incoming attack.
[70:13.13]Okay.
[70:15.01]As with all items, timely accessories can be equipped or not equipped on the gear tab.
[70:17.83]I don't know.
[70:19.39]I think I'm alright.
[70:21.29]I'll be fine.
[70:21.77]I just had to check.
[70:34.23]Oh no, I lost my touch.
[70:34.97]No more skipping.
[70:36.05]The music is... is preparing me for something.
[70:38.03]I like this.
[71:03.63]Get the item.
[71:12.98]Two gil.
[71:15.62]Two bucks?
[71:18.98]Wait, I gotta check over here.
[71:27.59]I didn't try to jump over that.
[71:28.69]I was trying to touch the butterflies that are above it.
[71:50.43]What are they doing?
[71:58.85]Oh, you fucked up so bad.
[72:00.60]How could you have stepped on one of the sticks?
[72:16.13]Oh, first time, first combat.
[72:21.36]Oh shit.
[72:22.50]Alright, cool.
[72:23.58]Floor check.
[72:53.64]Alright, we have pictures now.
[73:02.68]Did I miss any items or anything?
[73:03.56]I don't think so.
[73:10.85]I see a shiny.
[73:20.23]Can I get in here?
[73:22.15]Yep.
[73:26.17]strength tonic.
[73:31.33]Keep slaying those goblins.
[73:32.82]Alright.
[73:38.04]Welcome to Stillwind.
[73:39.16]Have care, my lord.
[73:45.71]Oh, more goblins.
[73:48.01]There's more.
[73:56.67]Oh, some enemies will drop gil or items upon the defeat.
[74:00.49]Loot is gathered automatically.
[74:01.94]Okay.
[74:13.32]Cool.
[74:16.96]I think you were worried, my lord.
[74:25.26]loot on the ground.
[74:27.06]I do appreciate the small denomination of currency.
[74:32.08]I don't want 10,000 gil in my pocket.
[74:34.44]I'd want like 10.
[74:39.37]Can't break it?
[74:40.23]Oh.
[74:49.70]Potion.
[74:50.42]Should I heal?
[74:50.94]No.
[74:51.04]No.
[75:01.78]strength tonic I should probably put these on the bar yeah the music is wonderful this is this should be a master class on how to do background music that feels engaging but it's not it's not too much it's not like offensive
[75:31.86]Spellslingers?
[75:33.20]Oh, they are Spellslingers.
[75:34.65]New enemies approach.
[76:05.34]Okay, I'm gonna... Okay, I was gonna say, I can just do that whenever I want.
[76:11.93]Hmm.
[76:27.25]If only you could speak goblin.
[76:32.20]Wait, lore check the spell slinger?
[76:35.42]There's not going to be individual lore cards for every enemy type.
[76:45.03]Can I do anything else with the fire, I wonder?
[76:46.41]There actually might be.
[76:51.39]Maybe.
[77:03.59]Ooh, pressing R2 like that definitely feels different for me.
[77:07.72]This is the next generation of controllers in my hand.
[77:21.64]I've barely experienced that.
[77:26.29]And this is a PlayStation thing.
[77:27.54]This is a... I have to squeeze it.
[77:30.38]You have to squeeze that shit.
[77:32.18]You have to squeeze it.
[77:33.36]We should be nearing the old village square.
[77:37.20]It might not be a nest of goblins.
[77:46.76]ad guy no I've I have never experienced this before I've never pressed the right trigger before and had to like squeeze it a little this I have just tell it this is my first experience playing with a peace station five
[78:13.74]Niki sauce.
[78:15.94]We're trapped.
[78:17.30]My Lord.
[78:17.84]Mm hmm.
[78:19.38]I'm working on it.
[78:22.29]Well, bring it on.
[78:22.87]Let's go.
[78:26.07]He's the leader.
[78:26.77]But we'll have to take care of his followers first.
[78:36.40]Oh.
[78:37.66]Care to spin the.
[78:38.70]Let's go.
[78:40.46]You have to ask.
[79:08.39]What do you got, what do you got, what do you got, what do you got?
[79:29.53]Coming!
[79:30.05]Holy shit!
[79:30.77]Okay.
[79:33.73]Let's do it.
[79:34.55]So Wade!
[79:35.05]On three!
[79:40.08]Larger enemies must be faced with caution.
[79:42.30]They have far more HP than their smaller counterparts and will often use devastating abilities to overwhelm opponents.
[79:47.47]Use the blessing of the Phoenix to not only deal considerable damage to these enemies, but also break their wills.
[79:54.67]Breaking an enemy's will can stagger it, leaving it unable to act invulnerable.
[79:57.65]Let's go.
[80:02.37]Found her.
[80:02.83]That's a swing and a half.
[80:04.95]Be ready to move when it winds up for another.
[80:07.61]You're going to have to tell me twice.
[80:20.12]This is fun.
[80:20.56]Alright.
[80:21.14]Enemies will become partially staggered when their will gauge is reduced to 50%.
[80:23.70]I don't want to check the lore right now.
[80:28.08]Creating a short opening.
[80:29.22]Hold on.
[80:33.81]Let me look at the lore book.
[80:39.75]I can't look at the lore book right now.
[80:57.95]Okay, I gotta time it better than that.
[80:59.45]Alright, let's go.
[81:07.05]Co-op, let's do it.
[81:10.37]Completely reducing an enemy's will gauge will stagger it.
[81:13.97]Extra damage is dealt when an enemy is fully staggered, increasing with each strike landed up to a maximum 150%.
[81:18.83]The total amount of damage dealt during this time is displayed upon the enemy regaining its senses.
[81:25.54]That's cool.
[81:27.12]Okay.
[81:30.07]So it just counts it all up.
[81:32.01]Alright, let's start counting.
[81:54.75]Oh, quadruple dog.
[81:56.49]Nice, Charlie.
[81:59.91]Dude.
[82:00.19]Alright.
[82:01.21]You got any more?
[82:02.33]You got any more in there?
[82:10.15]Alright, let's end it.
[82:47.83]Level up.
[82:52.67]Do I have to put any points in or anything?
[82:57.13]Hard leather.
[83:01.48]Following important battles, a separate results screen will appear displaying battle performance and rewards.
[83:06.54]Rewards are based on performance and may include items, gear, ability points, and experience points.
[83:14.99]OK.
[83:16.29]There's gear.
[83:29.66]I'm gonna stop this dude.
[83:33.94]After him before he summons the rest.
[83:36.97]But after all, let me get an item first.
[83:42.47]OK.
[83:43.71]So I gotta go to the gear tab.
[83:49.48]Learning new ones require ability points.
[83:57.96]Okay, here we are.
[83:59.64]The attributes tab provides a comprehensive overview of Clive's current level status, abilities, and gear.
[84:04.74]Alright, what does the gear look like?
[84:11.12]Okay, the gear and icons tab is used for equipping weapons and armor, as well as assigning iconic abilities.
[84:19.45]Alright, so this is 10 defense.
[84:21.97]Oh, I like that.
[84:22.65]I like that.
[84:24.02]Okay.
[84:26.14]Do I need new belts?
[84:30.12]Oh, I don't need to put on them.
[84:32.06]Put any of those on.
[84:34.66]Abilities.
[84:36.57]Ability points can be spent in the Abilities tab to acquire new abilities, as well as upgrade existing ones.
[84:41.77]If you are unsatisfied with Clive's current build, reset all abilities and try again.
[84:47.96]There is no penalty for doing so.
[84:51.42]Okay, this indicates an ability's capacity for dealing damage and for breaking a target's will.
[85:00.34]Melee attack.
[85:02.92]Skill points, too.
[85:06.49]OK, this is this is going to be.
[85:10.63]Alright, I'm excited.
[85:12.36]Alright, so I should.
[85:13.36]I wish I upgrade.
[85:16.30]Can I upgrade this?
[85:17.66]Just the melee ability?
[85:20.92]I have 152 ability points.
[85:25.75]Do magic instead.
[85:28.17]Magic burst.
[85:31.07]Or you can do that in between every single swing.
[85:37.55]Charred Magic.
[85:44.87]Hold to increase potency.
[85:48.03]Stomp.
[85:51.21]Upgrade Skipping.
[85:54.04]Phoenix Shift.
[85:56.30]Which makes that... I don't have enough.
[85:59.60]Let's go with... What are these?
[86:00.92]Okay.
[86:01.54]Swift Recovery.
[86:02.24]That's probably pretty good.
[86:03.96]Taunt?
[86:05.98]Taunt?
[86:09.93]Burning blade.
[86:12.59]Yeah, I want that.
[86:17.03]I want this even stronger.
[86:17.93]Do I have enough?
[86:23.35]Down thrust.
[86:25.55]Lunge.
[86:25.95]I like that too.
[86:27.11]Alright, I'm going to do lunge.
[86:31.55]And burning blade.
[86:34.62]So this is hold square and this one is square and X at the same time.
[86:41.56]Might as well just... Alright, I don't want to spend too many, though.
[86:45.28]This is holding triangle, okay.
[86:48.30]I want to save my points.
[86:51.16]Alright, let's go.
[86:51.52]So, let me see.
[86:51.92]Nice.
[86:55.43]And then lunge.
[86:56.59]And then if I hold, I can get a fire sword.
[87:00.11]And then... Saving in the demo.
[87:07.23]All of your progress carries over, by the way.
[87:13.06]Whatever you do in the demo carries over to the real game.
[87:18.02]Stomp is going to be essential with how cheap it is, probably.
[87:23.67]Well, we'll see.
[87:29.81]Come on, I could have hit him.
[87:31.23]I could have hit him.
[87:36.23]Please.
[87:41.09]It didn't really cause a problem.
[87:56.57]Is this the precursor to the real big scary boss?
[88:00.78]I wonder.
[88:01.08]Oh, yeah.
[88:09.21]It's never going to be that easy.
[88:10.67]What's in there?
[88:29.82]A bauble?
[88:31.70]Quick Clive, look at the book!
[88:32.80]Don't stand in that.
[89:03.50]Oh, I missed the lunge, sorry.
[89:22.72]Chip damage, chip damage, chip damage.
[89:39.96]Swing, swing, swing, swing!
[89:50.39]You good?
[89:50.65]Oh shit!
[90:05.46]Alright, this is cinematic strike mode.
[90:08.64]When the screen flashes blue like this during a pivotal moment in battle, or a square before time runs out, there's a cinematic QTE.
[90:23.73]Let's go.
[90:24.19]1,100, that's pretty good.
[90:25.43]I wonder if there's a cinematic upgrade tree.
[90:29.35]Now, before it recovers...
[91:01.38]Ooh.
[91:01.50]There's a parry in the game too.
[91:04.30]I'm fucking playing this for sure.
[91:07.80]Use square just as opponent attacks in temporary slows time and shit.
[91:11.53]Alright, what about deuce press?
[91:12.79]What is it?
[91:13.35]Square?
[91:16.68]There's a parry in the game.
[91:17.95]You've got me now.
[91:19.07]You've got me.
[91:19.69]I'm here.
[91:23.69]So it's right when it... Wait, I... Oh, I did it.
[91:26.61]Let me try it again.
[91:42.14]Oh, shit.
[91:42.86]Sorry.
[91:51.79]Oh, did it work?
[91:53.21]Oh, nope.
[91:53.93]Hold on.
[91:54.31]I'll get it.
[91:55.35]Square right when you're about to get hit.
[91:56.67]Just gonna practice it.
[92:03.49]Ow.
[92:07.82]Am I doing it wrong?
[92:10.12]I think I'm doing it wrong.
[92:12.60]Square?
[92:33.15]He won't be gone for long.
[92:35.55]Stick to dodge roll spells, boy.
[92:39.19]I cannot fall here.
[92:46.34]Something else.
[92:46.90]Cinematic evasion.
[92:48.06]Okay.
[92:56.44]Now for the final push, my lord.
[93:01.12]I'm a caster, I'm gonna stay back here.
[93:08.08]I'm good.
[93:33.48]true I kind of like these two guys too I didn't care at all until 10 seconds ago about these two
[94:11.06]I gotta do the thrust more often.
[94:58.21]Don't do it!
[95:00.71]I don't have any heals left.
[95:01.65]I gotta be careful.
[95:02.27]I don't wanna... Oh, fuck.
[95:03.31]I'm gonna die right now.
[95:10.41]There it is.
[95:10.79]That's the end.
[95:21.17]Alright, time to flee.
[95:21.89]Time to play like a coward.
[95:24.45]Are those guys okay?
[95:38.93]Get him!
[95:45.65]Almost through there, that's true.
[95:55.43]Almost died to the tutorial boss.
[95:57.71]Well, the tutorial boss is there for you to learn how the game functions.
[96:02.12]I think I did a pretty good job.
[96:19.44]My lord.
[96:20.82]Thanks.
[96:23.94]I never thought I'd see it.
[96:26.50]Not just goblins in Rosaria, but more balls too.
[96:31.08]I'll petition His Grace to send a detachment.
[96:36.60]If we don't stop them here, they'll be at our gates before long.
[96:43.53]We should get moving.
[96:45.01]We don't want to be caught out here after dark.
[96:47.33]If we set off now, we can still reach Phoenix Gate before nightfall.
[97:01.00]Third boss.
[97:03.00]Lands.
[97:07.34]Damned blight.
[97:10.66]Is it still alive?
[97:11.24]It might be.
[97:21.15]OK.
[97:31.33]This is the Phoenix Gate.
[97:40.27]Check it out.
[97:49.67]Some time later.
[97:56.13]Suddenly, thousands of red eyes.
[97:59.89]Lord Jack.
[98:30.30]Oh, imagine there was like 40 circles.
[98:36.30]Is there updated info, though?
[98:42.38]There's a little indicator on here.
[98:44.46]Oh, maybe it means he just showed up.
[98:49.57]The young lord has a bright future ahead of him.
[98:52.53]Aye.
[98:53.29]On one of these nights, he may even deign to join us.
[98:58.27]It does have updated info.
[99:10.90]I really do appreciate that, though, because I have said many, many times how I just kind of... Sometimes I just need to open up like a thing and give me like two sentences of who the fuck these people are.
[99:34.72]Makes it easy to jump back in.
[99:35.62]Potentially days or weeks later, too.
[99:37.56]Father?
[100:03.28]Why is it that the Dominants is always born into our family?
[100:07.93]It doesn't seem fair.
[100:15.21]We cannot live without the blessing of the crystals, and the crystals work their magic through us.
[100:23.70]I'm gonna eat that bread so bad.
[100:24.92]You have been blessed, Joshua.
[100:27.70]Blessed to be a Dominant, to wield the power of an icon.
[100:33.01]Our family has been chosen to share that power with the people.
[100:38.93]So that is what we must do.
[100:43.03]Follow me, boy, all the rolling green arrows.
[100:49.67]Follow the flames and arise from the shadows.
[100:56.37]Hear the Rosarian voices.
[101:02.85]Drunk, singing, eating a shitload of bread.
[101:08.45]That sounds like a great time, doesn't it?
[101:11.73]That sounds great.
[101:12.97]Louder, my friends!
[101:17.89]Louder!
[101:23.44]A room full of carbs, yeah.
[101:25.00]I don't suppose I'll be nice.
[101:38.24]It's an off-brand meeting.
[101:39.72]Well, I don't think we would get very much done.
[101:52.72]Poor Jill.
[101:54.34]She'll be wondering where you've got to.
[101:57.82]So much for you being a fine hound.
[102:11.04]So this is where you've been hiding.
[102:18.43]Torgal, Clive's faithful friend, brought back from one of Archduke Elwyn's expeditions to the frozen northern territories, where he was found half-starved and shivering in a snowfield, having presumably been separated from his pack.
[102:32.66]Elwyn gifted the puppy to Clive upon his return, and the two became nigh inseparable.
[102:42.10]That was cool.
[103:14.88]I hear you slew a morbel.
[103:18.56]All the men were singing your praises.
[103:22.04]They never used to.
[103:24.85]When I joined the ranks, everyone thought I was a spoiled little lordling.
[103:29.67]If I didn't know how to handle a sword, I'd be a laughingstock.
[103:33.37]The Archduke's firstborn failure.
[103:37.83]Where have I... You're the one they really believe in.
[103:39.55]Where have I heard this voice actor before?
[103:41.91]I'm jealous.
[103:44.60]That's not true.
[103:45.50]They don't believe in me.
[103:47.68]They believe in the power of the Dominant.
[103:50.15]I heard this.
[103:54.47]My brother the Phoenix.
[103:56.75]Ruler over life and death.
[103:59.63]It isn't fair.
[104:01.19]It should have been you.
[104:02.25]I don't have what it takes to lead our people.
[104:07.66]I don't have the strength.
[104:09.96]But you do.
[104:10.80]Let me see.
[104:12.56]Hold on.
[104:19.20]every man has his duty ours was decided long ago when our ancestors chose to instate the dominant as the archduke of rosaria hold on I'll find it to ensure that whenever our nation stood on a precipice the phoenix would rise from the flames to drag us back from the brink the fate of rosaria sits on the dominant shoulders
[104:48.11]It is your duty to bear that burden.
[104:50.67]Holy shit.
[104:51.45]What about you?
[104:52.09]This guy's done so much work.
[104:55.28]This is like an unbelievable catalog of work.
[104:58.64]That is why I was given the Phoenix's blessing.
[105:01.78]To keep our future rulers safe.
[105:03.62]No matter what.
[105:07.94]Wait, I got the wrong person.
[105:09.02]I'll never let you down.
[105:13.93]Thank you, Clive.
[105:15.31]I know you'll always take care of me.
[105:19.90]Do I have the wrong person?
[105:20.90]No, no, I do.
[105:23.62]I have the right person.
[105:24.80]Where have I heard this voice before?
[105:53.33]Ben Star.
[105:54.05]Yeah, where have I heard this voice though?
[105:56.03]Recently.
[105:56.45]The trailer?
[106:20.50]Supplies from the capital.
[106:25.86]It's got a familiar voice or a familiar way of speaking.
[106:37.79]You took your time sampling the wearers, were you?
[106:48.25]The first person I looked up at thought it was the same person, but it wasn't.
[106:51.24]Spare a bath for the boys and beat me.
[106:55.37]Sounds good.
[106:56.05]I like it.
[106:57.63]You're missing lore pauses.
[107:22.86]It's not going to give me lore right now.
[107:25.13]No, no.
[107:25.91]No, it's not.
[107:26.73]Guys, it doesn't give you spoilers.
[107:28.43]It just tells you what you should know by that point.
[107:40.33]You don't get to look and see what this guy does two chapters from now.
[107:44.73]It doesn't work like that.
[108:19.83]Uh-oh.
[108:27.45]Oh, magical spells.
[108:28.53]Alright, get out there and just like... Joshua has a four-hit combo with ice spells.
[108:46.70]Only knew his name was Joshua because I did the thing.
[108:49.64]I looked at it.
[108:50.04]Very well.
[108:50.64]I'm ready.
[109:05.67]Oh, shit.
[109:06.35]Alright.
[109:08.03]Wait, actually, it is.
[109:08.95]It's true.
[109:10.03]I actually am going to play as this character.
[109:11.67]Now, you guys thought I was full of shit.
[109:13.06]I'm going to have, like, ice moves get out of my hands.
[109:16.12]You thought I was full of shit.
[109:18.44]Yeah.
[109:19.74]Really?
[109:20.10]I think I used all of his fucking power.
[109:25.10]Alright.
[109:29.28]I just did 999.
[109:29.56]999 damage.
[109:29.84]I'm ready.
[109:34.69]Are the enemy already inside the castle?
[109:37.27]I'm afraid so, Your Highness.
[109:38.41]We must hurry.
[109:52.58]So there are caster characters, okay.
[109:56.20]The kid just cast fucking Starlight.
[110:02.08]Alright, let's do it.
[110:05.20]Oh, yeah?
[110:08.04]Did I get in there?
[110:11.96]This kid is strong.
[110:38.56]Nice whiff.
[110:39.34]I thought it was a range.
[110:40.55]I thought it was range.
[110:48.43]Kiraga is a heal.
[110:51.73]I think I remember that.
[110:54.99]9,999 heal.
[111:10.85]Alright, so I got that.
[111:33.41]I can only do one.
[111:34.17]I don't have a chain with it though.
[111:35.55]Maybe I do if I go land two.
[111:39.14]Damn it.
[111:39.64]The bastards are everywhere.
[111:41.72]Why would the Empire do this?
[111:43.88]They're our allies.
[111:44.86]This is bullshit.
[111:49.15]Anything going on down here?
[112:09.46]Is there a stealth kill?
[112:18.71]Haha, haha, idiot.
[112:20.62]Stupid idiot.
[112:38.81]Uh-oh.
[112:40.69]That's not good.
[112:41.59]Tyler!
[112:43.41]We just started to care about Tyler.
[112:45.89]This is not good.
[112:49.45]Your Highness, I...
[113:06.08]Don't worry, you're going to be alright.
[113:13.94]I'll hold them off.
[113:30.44]Oh.
[113:32.28]Oh.
[113:33.33]It's you.
[113:36.43]Why?
[113:41.01]It's alright, my lord.
[113:48.51]It can only be three party members anyways.
[113:50.27]You guys go on ahead.
[113:52.79]Figure it out later.
[114:01.94]You rescued the young prince.
[114:04.50]Well done, Sir Wade.
[114:07.28]I'm in your debt, soldier.
[114:12.00]Thank you, Your Grace.
[114:18.42]How come there's never a fantasy character with a Boston accent?
[114:22.35]That would be just wouldn't make any sense.
[114:26.45]You stay fucking here, kid.
[114:27.73]You just chill out.
[114:28.59]Do that cure shit on that guy.
[114:30.09]Heal his fucking wounds.
[114:32.98]I'll take everybody out.
[114:33.75]We'll go up front and we'll just fuck these motherfuckers up.
[114:39.41]Hey, can I get your cockies?
[114:40.31]I just want to pocket somewhere else because there's like three people behind you.
[114:44.63]I'm in front of you.
[114:45.89]I don't want you to trap anybody.
[114:47.13]Okay.
[115:05.35]The north gate's up ahead.
[115:06.93]There are chocobos in the stables.
[115:09.14]Father, take Joshua and get to safety.
[115:12.54]No, I'm not going without you.
[115:14.68]You're supposed to be my shield, remember?
[115:17.18]It'd be great to have that 9,999 heal.
[115:19.26]I would love to take this kid.
[115:22.67]Which is why I'm going to hold the enemy here while you make your escape.
[115:26.61]I will order our remaining forces to rally at the gate.
[115:29.67]Now go.
[115:38.29]I will do my duty.
[115:40.13]You must do your duty too.
[115:47.05]I know.
[115:51.45]You have to keep father safe.
[115:53.53]If I like this, would I like 15 as well?
[115:56.55]Joshua.
[115:58.31]Somebody just said you would like 15 if you like this.
[116:04.45]Maybe.
[116:10.13]You would like 14.
[116:29.38]We going for it?
[116:31.12]Is this the?
[116:34.48]14 is pretty good, yeah.
[116:38.70]well I I don't have to know anything right it's just it's it's just its own video game I don't need to know everything that happened in the last 15 games the last 12 games or anything I should bro okay I got potions on there already
[117:07.17]Alright.
[117:14.90]Oh, dodge.
[117:15.74]Wrong dodge.
[117:19.96]Stuck on the table.
[117:36.64]Don't forget to parry.
[117:39.46]I should probably learn how to parry on these guys.
[117:41.33]I think he's trying to get away from me.
[117:49.51]I'll try parry.
[117:50.47]He said parry is hard.
[117:54.11]Well, that's good.
[117:58.20]Insufficient inventory space.
[118:00.38]High potion used.
[118:06.68]Do I have to get a bigger stash or bigger inventory eventually or something?
[118:31.35]This way you can't hold 99 potions and trivialize the game.
[118:37.64]Oh, cool.
[118:38.16]Alright, here's a big fight.
[118:39.82]Focus up.
[118:40.08]You got it.
[118:40.38]Can we try it?
[118:43.02]Hold on.
[118:43.54]Let's see.
[119:05.92]Right when you're... Oh, no.
[119:08.28]Too early.
[119:28.13]I was practicing, dad.
[119:29.91]No, wait, wait, who is this?
[119:34.47]Who is this?
[119:34.95]I have the wrong character.
[119:36.83]I need my lore book.
[119:37.67]Uh-oh, fuck, who is this?
[119:45.68]Oh, shit.
[119:50.31]Let's get him.
[119:51.29]Oh, that hurt a lot.
[119:52.99]Oh, that hurts a lot too.
[119:54.41]Oh, that hurt real bad.
[120:20.29]Alright, I gotta get better.
[120:21.27]I gotta get better.
[120:21.85]I gotta get better.
[120:24.68]I gotta get way better than this.
[120:25.82]I gotta be better than this.
[120:27.76]Your time has passed!
[120:39.83]Stay still, damn you!
[120:48.93]That's fine, back up.
[120:51.04]Whoa!
[120:56.56]I gotta parry that.
[121:01.48]That didn't work.
[121:16.68]Parry.
[121:18.75]Is that right?
[121:19.17]I don't think it was right.
[121:36.70]Ooh.
[121:40.63]Oh, shit.
[121:42.85]Is he?
[121:45.23]I love that.
[121:46.05]It's so... It's just like dialing up to 100.
[122:09.17]I think he's spitting.
[122:10.15]He's spitting up.
[122:10.71]Whoa!
[122:20.40]Oh, he's got a combo.
[122:48.12]Send it.
[122:48.76]I forgot my cool combo.
[122:55.59]It was cool, I promise.
[123:16.97]Dude, I'm so glad this game isn't coming out like next year.
[123:28.40]Do you know what I mean?
[123:42.41]Night of the blinding dawn slain.
[123:54.36]Level up.
[123:57.36]That music is just... Alright, you know when you play a game and it's just... You know, the music is kind of going... And it fits, and you're just like, yep.
[124:06.37]I almost play to the beat.
[124:07.93]Do you guys do that too?
[124:17.73]Are you hurt?
[124:19.72]I'm fine.
[124:26.43]So, they sent in the Dragoons.
[124:29.32]Imperial vipers.
[124:31.94]Do they really mean to invade us?
[124:36.02]Not yet.
[124:38.18]Their numbers were too few.
[124:40.52]They were not here to take the castle.
[124:43.38]They were here to take heads.
[124:46.90]Our work is done.
[124:48.34]We should return to my father.
[124:53.46]We issued these sashes, but yesterday.
[124:55.57]You're saying I wonder how deep the skill system gets in the full game?
[124:59.27]I don't know.
[124:59.65]That's a good question.
[125:01.07]Father and Joshua are in danger.
[125:02.79]We must hurry.
[125:03.89]Take your steed.
[125:12.63]What is this?
[125:28.87]Did you just mouth fuck you to me?
[125:44.64]I read lips.
[125:50.08]See, the dog is fine.
[125:51.16]Everybody was freaking out about that.
[125:57.47]Your Grace, is everyone safe?
[125:59.97]For the moment.
[126:02.38]We ride for Rosalith to rally our forces.
[126:04.56]I will need your help to see Joshua safely back to the capital.
[126:09.80]On you get, Joshua.
[126:17.02]What the hell?
[126:20.27]Father?
[126:20.83]What the fuck was that?
[126:22.61]I'm sorry, Your Grace, but that won't be possible.
[126:27.27]Hey that oh.
[126:31.45]Snakes.
[126:33.37]Oh no, I think we're going to lose.
[126:53.28]If we're going to lose another one.
[127:04.70]You must do your duty, too.
[127:06.68]You have to keep father safe.
[127:11.16]I have to.
[127:11.94]I had to.
[127:12.48]Clive, I... I'm counting on you, Joshua.
[127:32.65]oh he okay he's the phoenix he's the phoenix phoenix
[128:11.23]Oh, this is where we start here.
[128:29.93]He's lost control.
[128:31.91]I have to do something.
[128:33.65]I have to save him.
[128:34.83]My Lord fall back.
[128:47.00]Ow.
[128:51.09]Oh no, the chocobo!
[128:55.41]Thank you, God.
[128:56.49]You saved my life.
[129:03.63]Get her on her feet and run.
[129:06.20]Please.
[129:13.52]Joshua, are you in pain?
[129:22.07]Come on!
[129:23.13]You're his shield.
[129:25.75]Do your duty.
[129:28.63]What?
[129:31.17]Save him.
[129:33.96]My lord?
[130:02.60]Whoa, wait, did I?
[130:09.58]Wait, what?
[130:11.32]Oh my god.
[130:13.44]I need to check the lore.
[130:14.62]I have to check the lore.
[130:16.60]Who?
[130:17.34]What happened?
[130:19.18]Firstborn son of Archduke Elwynn, ruler of Rosaria, through all expected to inherit the Phoenix's Flames and awaken as its dominant...
[130:26.73]Destiny instead chose his younger brother Joshua to bear that burden.
[130:29.82]In search of a role of his own, Clive dedicated himself to mastering the blade, and his practice paid off when he was appointed First Shield of Rosaria.
[130:37.90]Okay.
[130:39.10]Tasked to guard the Phoenix and blessed with the ability to wield a part of his fire.
[130:45.21]Oh.
[130:46.69]Okay.
[131:00.01]Do I actually get to walk around and play as this character?
[131:03.15]This is...
[131:32.79]What the fuck?
[131:34.51]Okay.
[131:36.23]So... We're doing... We have... Okay.
[132:02.51]Wait, I have to actually aim!
[132:17.85]Wow!
[132:20.30]Ow!
[132:30.52]Here we go.
[132:43.68]We both go horizontal on a 2D plane that just goes 3, 2, 1, HIT!
[132:48.04]Uh oh.
[132:58.02]Okay.
[133:14.45]I think I'm going to get there.
[133:15.79]Alright, when he glows like that's when I have to dodge.
[133:30.94]Here comes.
[133:32.30]No, not yet.
[133:42.55]Well, I'm shooting a lot of fireballs too.
[133:44.79]It's not just him.
[134:15.82]shoot him alright I'm gonna be ready to evade here it comes oh that was actually pretty close
[134:50.09]Stop jumping around!
[134:53.16]Do I have to dodge that?
[134:58.42]Where is he?
[135:00.40]Jesus!
[135:00.70]Oh my god, dude!
[135:03.57]I made a promise to my brother!
[135:10.07]And I'm here to keep it!
[135:26.93]Now we're on the offensive, alright.
[135:35.27]I love the icons.
[135:38.83]The top left and top right.
[135:51.58]Oh, I am shooting a million fireballs right now.
[136:00.07]Sorry.
[136:00.33]I don't think I'm getting away from this.
[136:13.46]Oh my god, I was so paying no attention.
[136:15.76]I was just spamming and I wasn't... I forgot I had to actually dodge.
[136:25.68]Damnation?
[136:28.08]In how many seconds?
[136:39.71]Hellfire?
[136:43.49]Uh-oh.
[136:48.97]Dude, he just... He just... Wait.
[136:53.13]I...
[136:56.16]What is going on right now?
[136:57.32]I mean, it's fucking awesome, but what is happening?
[137:07.74]Okay.
[137:08.10]I should have done a lore check.
[137:10.95]Like, that was kind of like when a company does an E3 presentation.
[137:17.87]And it's like, look at this game that we've got!
[137:21.25]Our E3 presentation!
[137:24.00]That actually happened in the game.
[137:26.77]That happened in the game.
[137:28.53]Here.
[137:31.51]We got to see an E3 presentation that actually made it through into the video game.
[137:42.16]That was fucking cool.
[137:52.53]Hashtag ad.
[137:53.13]Yes, of course, hashtag ad.
[137:54.45]But the game is fucking phenomenal.
[137:55.99]Okay.
[138:04.81]I'm having a ton of fun.
[138:06.43]I want to play way more of this.
[138:11.20]Combat was really fun.
[138:12.08]I think I could actually get into it.
[138:29.76]Just the fighting is just so much different than what I've ever played with Final Fantasy.
[138:36.76]Round two.
[138:49.13]What the fuck?
[138:50.81]This is awful.
[138:53.99]This is awful.
[139:00.30]No!
[139:02.02]Stop it!
[139:03.96]Take your hands off my brother!
[139:07.78]Help me!
[139:09.92]Help me, Ty!
[139:12.24]What is going on?
[139:14.76]Joshua!
[139:16.18]Stop it!
[139:18.00]Stop it!
[139:20.61]I swore I would protect him!
[139:30.03]Wait, what?
[139:32.29]Is the dog?
[140:18.33]I'll kill you!
[140:20.89]I'll fucking kill you!
[140:41.00]Damn.
[140:44.78]Please do a lore check, please.
[140:48.40]Oh, we... Sorry, I missed it.
[141:02.23]When we started here, I was like, alright, I'm not sure where we're going with it.
[141:11.77]I was not expecting any of that.
[141:15.25]That we're just going to be as like a band of adventurers.
[141:23.14]Haven't you done enough, Captain?
[141:26.14]Joshua was my world.
[141:28.60]And now he is gone.
[141:31.78]I can only pray there will be a place for me in the world his radiance seeks to create.
[141:39.98]I see.
[141:42.04]I can't believe it.
[141:52.38]Your Grace, over here.
[141:53.68]Make sure to walk over very evilly, too, while you're at it.
[142:05.35]The rubble must have protected him from the worst of the flames.
[142:08.58]Shall we take him prisoner?
[142:10.47]No need for that.
[142:12.35]Kill him.
[142:14.33]Kill him?
[142:16.39]Wait.
[142:16.63]Has my husband never tired of telling me?
[142:21.10]He is a fine soldier.
[142:25.04]I'm sure he would make an excellent addition to the Imperial frontline.
[142:31.51]All in its right place.
[142:38.97]What the fuck?
[142:39.97]Oh my god, dude.
[142:42.11]What the hell?
[142:44.59]You all didn't think we were going here.
[142:46.11]None of you did.
[142:47.21]None of you did.
[142:47.71]None of you did.
[142:48.63]Why?
[142:48.81]What?
[142:49.11]Oh my goodness.
[142:49.59]Okay.
[142:49.79]Well.
[143:10.86]I'm very interested.
[143:12.96]Thank you for watching this.
[143:15.22]Yeah.
[143:15.38]Thank you for playing.
[143:17.92]You've completed the Final Fantasy 16 demo, but there's still much more story to tell.
[143:22.01]If you'd like to learn more of Clive and the dominance, please consider purchasing the main game.
[143:30.13]Consider me considering.
[143:33.05]You know what I mean?
[143:35.79]That was great.
[143:39.31]So I will absolutely be playing this again.
[143:42.63]You'll see it again.
[143:43.17]I wish I could kind of keep playing right now.
[143:53.74]When does this come out?
[143:54.26]Okay.
[144:03.08]Playthrough data saved.
[144:03.98]Playthrough data can be carried over to the main game, allowing you to continue from where you left off in the demo.
[144:08.98]Demo playthrough data cannot be loaded in the demo version.
[144:12.59]To play the demo again, you must select New Game from the title screen.
[144:18.71]Oh, okay.
[144:20.94]I have to pee so bad.
[144:22.82]I will be right back.
[144:24.22]But that was great.
[144:26.36]Again, yes, this is a sponsored segment of the stream.
[144:28.52]Square Enix, thanks for sponsoring the stream.
[144:30.64]And obviously Final Fantasy 16.
[144:34.72]Demo, you can go get it right now.
[144:36.71]It's a free demo on the PS5 store.
[144:39.37]If you want to check it out for yourself, you can.
[144:44.75]That was great.
[144:45.61]I liked it a lot.
[144:47.31]Don't save the game.
[144:48.41]Don't save.
[144:49.03]Don't save.
[144:49.77]Don't save.
[144:55.25]Should I save it?
[144:55.91]No, no, I should save it.
[144:57.38]I will.
[144:57.60]I got to pee.
[144:58.13]I'll be right back.
[144:58.73]Give me one second.
[145:36.57]you
[147:01.09]Okay, I am back.
[147:02.85]So there's more to the demo.
[147:06.36]What more is there to do?
[147:15.32]More to do.
[147:16.13]Okay, so I got it saved.
[147:22.01]Just kind of back out.
[147:22.71]Okay.
[147:24.48]purchase from PlayStation store digital deluxe or the base game um okay well that's the end that there's another mid-game mission really go back to the title screen wait are people I think that's the end I don't think there's anything else I mean I'll go back to the title screen
[147:49.43]Ah, there is, there is.
[147:51.12]Okay, there is more to look at.
[147:53.48]The iconic challenge has been unlocked and is now available from the title menu in this special mode set later in the game.
[147:59.32]Clive has been equipped with the feats and abilities of three unique icons, the Phoenix, Garuda, and Titan, to allow you to get a better feel of Final Fantasy XVI's exciting battle system.
[148:11.46]Well, we're doing that.
[148:15.04]Okay, note.
[148:17.30]This challenge was created specifically for this demo, and its features differ slightly from what appears in the final game.
[148:23.54]Gear, items, abilities are not representative of what normally, what are normally available to Clive during this part of the story.
[148:30.07]Makes sense.
[148:34.69]The world map and journal have been removed from the main menu.
[148:37.13]Save, autosave, and load functionality is unavailable.
[148:40.13]So this is exclusive for the demo, and it's not going to spoil anything.
[148:44.10]That's cool.
[148:46.31]I think we already know this, right?
[148:50.27]Do we know this?
[148:54.01]We know this, right?
[148:55.38]Is there spoilers here?
[148:59.12]This is new.
[148:59.74]It will spoil, but just a small section.
[149:01.58]There's some story, but we don't know broader context.
[149:06.36]This is spoilers.
[149:07.50]Very mild spoilers.
[149:08.49]Okay.
[149:12.42]Well, it said they made it specifically for the demo.
[149:13.86]I'm imagining it's an early part of the game.
[149:17.14]Yeah.
[149:17.56]Okay.
[149:18.32]Alright.
[149:18.56]We join the two as they begin their infiltration of Caernorvent, an ancient stronghold wherein his brother is supposed to kill her, a second dominant of fire.
[149:26.21]It's said to be held by an elite party of Willowder knights commanded by Benedicta Harmon.
[149:34.95]Okay.
[149:35.31]So 13 years have passed since their tragic events, which saw Clive robbed of his brother, his father, and his home.
[149:40.68]Okay.
[149:42.33]Or is this freedom in the hands of a man named Cid who agrees to aid our hero in his search for answers?
[149:46.17]Okay.
[149:47.67]I think it's spoiling what we just saw.
[149:49.25]And maybe like a little, tiny little snippet.
[149:54.63]I would be surprised if they would spoil something in a demo.
[149:57.33]I think we're probably going to get some pretty out of context things.
[150:01.93]One of our sentries has failed to report, milady.
[150:04.91]Your orders?
[150:05.71]Pull the men back inside the care, Geralt.
[150:08.10]He is here, then.
[150:10.05]Have them lead Sid and his little pet to the chapel.
[150:13.77]I shall entertain them there.
[150:17.31]Lore check?
[150:17.83]No, I'm not doing a lore check.
[150:18.99]Not now.
[150:25.12]They've also said this won't be exactly the same as the game.
[150:27.40]It'll be changed.
[150:28.58]That's actually really smart.
[150:30.64]That's a smart thing.
[150:31.64]Like, oh, hey, yeah, we're just making a... The cutscene's just different.
[150:34.74]And the characters are not even the fucking same, probably.
[150:37.14]We just made this up.
[150:56.94]Okay, well that's fucking awesome.
[151:02.15]I don't know the context, but I now know context that dog is playable character in game.
[151:06.79]Now we're really cooking.
[151:11.29]Press L to the cycle between currently attuned icons in real time.
[151:15.73]Cooldown times for iconic abilities are displayed around the corresponding icon.
[151:18.74]Okay.
[151:20.36]So everything has cooldowns.
[151:21.30]You can switch.
[151:21.94]That's a nice trick.
[151:24.86]You'll have to teach me sometime.
[151:26.28]He's everywhere.
[151:27.22]That actor is everywhere now.
[151:29.38]I hear him every fucking day.
[151:36.67]He's got a great voice.
[151:38.95]Right.
[151:39.15]Okay, so what...
[151:42.03]I can change to... How do I swap?
[151:52.88]Oh, I see what's going on.
[151:54.32]Alright, let's do deadly embrace.
[152:05.95]We should start with the dungeons.
[152:07.71]They may be holding the bearers there.
[152:09.89]Sound good.
[152:17.73]He's gonna be great in this game too.
[152:19.57]I can already tell.
[152:23.94]They're all empty.
[152:24.64]They're all empty.
[152:27.30]You can still skip as an adult.
[152:30.04]Yes.
[152:54.22]Aw.
[153:02.09]Wait, there's more to the demo?
[153:03.77]Yeah.
[153:04.81]So there is a, we didn't know this until the very end, but there's like a little snippet from the middle of the game that they tried to make sure there wasn't very many spoilers in it.
[153:13.02]And it's just, hey, take a look at some more of the combat shit for like a minute or two while you have a minute.
[153:23.00]Alright, what about these other moves?
[153:54.63]Let's just do a limit break.
[153:55.75]Fuck it.
[154:13.91]I thought he just burped really loud.
[154:15.85]That was a dog growling.
[154:26.99]Devil May Cry designers chops are showing here.
[154:31.01]Yeah, it's going to be fun.
[154:33.49]This door only leads to more royalists.
[154:36.07]We better find another one.
[154:39.45]Read the abilities.
[154:42.23]Rising Flames Scarlet Cyclone.
[154:46.21]Oh, it's been quickly creating a ring of fire.
[154:49.37]Look at that.
[154:52.03]What?
[154:53.39]Oh, I am pogging in real life.
[155:02.80]Gouge.
[155:03.32]Summon twin claws that relentlessly tear at a target.
[155:05.58]Can be used in midair.
[155:08.56]Come with rising attacks, striking all enemies within range.
[155:11.80]Cool.
[155:13.56]Punch forward.
[155:14.32]Hold button to wind up attack.
[155:15.81]Further increasing potency.
[155:17.17]Ooh, okay.
[155:17.75]So you do let it go in the red, probably.
[155:18.95]Okay.
[155:33.75]Where were we going?
[155:34.39]I'm going the right way.
[155:37.07]Am I going the wrong way?
[155:41.78]OK.
[155:46.04]Just not that way.
[156:04.99]It runs pretty well.
[156:07.63]I have the frame rate mode turned on, but it seems to be pretty clean.
[156:14.72]Where am I going?
[156:19.56]My screen is darker than the stream screen.
[156:21.58]I don't know why.
[156:23.40]Oh, right.
[156:23.96]I have the mode where I can see things.
[156:31.14]Oh, it is right here.
[156:38.21]Use the animal instinct.
[156:45.37]Can you please pet the dog?
[156:47.77]Find out.
[156:53.38]Probably not in a combat scenario.
[156:58.12]Well, we found the imperial garrison.
[157:02.22]Right where the royalists left.
[157:14.63]Holy shit.
[157:15.47]Whoa, there's more to the second part.
[157:17.85]They all were, like, flying.
[157:19.57]They, like, can't even talk.
[157:21.91]Yeah!
[157:24.79]Yeah!
[157:31.34]Yeah!
[157:33.08]I'm gonna try the Phoenix move.
[157:41.34]Cool.
[157:46.13]Wyvrite and Magicked Ash.
[157:52.37]Did I miss any items or anything?
[157:55.45]No.
[157:57.99]Can we get a Bald Cam, please?
[158:00.53]Maybe on your birthday.
[158:19.65]Oh, you can really change stuff together.
[158:21.26]That's enough.
[158:27.14]Alright, the chains are going to be fun.
[158:30.72]I think I gotta turn my brightness up a little.
[158:38.34]See I do it from here.
[158:48.63]Uh, camera settings, graphic settings, screen brightness.
[158:59.58]That's better.
[159:02.48]There we go.
[159:06.62]What about you have a light?
[159:08.14]You have a light.
[159:08.94]I can wait.
[159:10.04]Can I turn the light on?
[159:11.00]I have a light move.
[159:12.50]Do I?
[159:18.20]do the light move?
[159:24.66]I don't think so.
[159:31.77]It's on the Phoenix.
[159:32.95]Oh, okay.
[159:33.39]Wait, that's a block.
[159:34.73]I wonder how much it blocks.
[159:38.77]Okay, that's cool.
[159:47.52]Damn Shit, I missed it
[160:19.67]That was a good parry.
[160:23.17]Get him, boy.
[160:55.13]This guy, yeah, this guy does not stand a chance.
[161:10.22]Trying to crush him.
[161:21.83]Any item?
[161:23.65]This map feels nostalgic.
[161:26.89]There are probably some nods to the previous games or previous things.
[161:31.03]There usually is, isn't there?
[161:36.67]Favor of fire.
[161:37.53]All this bloody running.
[161:50.97]After them!
[161:55.05]My birthday is on August 2nd.
[161:56.23]Please do a bald cam.
[161:57.43]I swear I'll... Okay.
[162:02.15]Attacking an opponent from the front while it is guarding will deal no damage.
[162:05.22]Circle to the rear to penetrate its defenses.
[162:07.86]Certain basic abilities such as Burning Blade and Charged Magic as well as iconic abilities such as the Phoenix Rising Flames can instantly break an opponent's guard when delivered from the front.
[162:17.84]Okay.
[162:17.96]Good to know.
[162:21.27]Seems they were expecting us.
[162:22.65]You don't say.
[162:33.56]Back it up.
[162:47.89]New enemies coming up, whatever.
[162:49.11]Uh, let me try this.
[163:06.90]Alright, I can't... When the game comes out, I think I'm doing the Titanic stuff.
[163:12.31]Feels really strong.
[163:20.13]You know what to do, boy.
[163:22.63]Get him, boy!
[163:27.67]Alright, anybody else?
[163:33.87]That's for the Triton!
[163:34.79]Sick of Toggle!
[163:42.72]I don't know who to swing at but... Jesus.
[164:06.31]So what are the two bars under my health?
[164:14.59]I wonder.
[164:14.89]Oops.
[164:23.24]That's limit break.
[164:24.96]Alright, time for a limit break.
[164:45.13]I gotta get used to that.
[164:48.79]You're playing the game on easy right now.
[164:50.07]You have the rings on.
[164:51.51]It's OK.
[164:51.94]I think they put him on to make it so you can see just how wild some of the combos can get.
[165:03.92]What the hell happened here?
[165:14.60]Little late for prayer, isn't it?
[165:18.12]Do I seem so desperate as to grovel at the feet of a false god?
[165:22.60]I was waiting for you.
[165:27.39]Not for too long, I hope.
[165:31.23]All this for a midnight chat.
[165:35.49]Well, let's chat then.
[165:38.09]Where are the men and women you took from Lostwing?
[165:41.01]You mean, where's the Dominant?
[165:43.06]I don't know who this is, but I'm sure we'll find out.
[165:45.56]Think of all the things we can create together.
[165:47.51]The world that we can build.
[165:56.98]You need me?
[166:00.06]Your king needs me.
[166:01.88]I'm all for building a new world.
[166:04.70]Just not his.
[166:05.84]The dog is also agreeing.
[166:06.96]That bastard's dreams are as twisted as his promises are false.
[166:10.74]Yeah.
[166:11.14]I want no part of him.
[166:12.44]We don't want anything to do with you.
[166:14.48]And this is how you speak of him.
[166:16.88]Have you no shred of loyalty?
[166:19.96]What?
[166:21.06]To a leader who'd use me?
[166:23.89]Like he uses you.
[166:26.00]you know nothing of me sidolphus you're right I don't know who you are anymore or what you want I only know what you used to say that you were tired of running that you just wanted to be free free of it all yeah the demo is over this is just like extra line to me then what made you think you had to sacrifice who you were to get what you wanted
[166:56.85]I use my talents to my advantage, and you would tell me there is shame in that?
[167:01.83]If there's no shame, then why do you feel so sorry for yourself?
[167:06.04]A rousing speech, Lord Commander.
[167:07.98]I was a fool to believe you might have changed.
[167:12.52]The only person I feel sorry for is you!
[167:15.44]I can't do this anymore.
[167:26.56]If you would stand between our leash and his dream, then you leave me no choice.
[167:35.02]Goodbye, Sedolphus.
[167:38.08]Go home.
[167:43.40]Stand back, Clark.
[167:56.97]Oh, he's getting in.
[167:57.71]He's going to stand like a magical electricity.
[168:14.31]They all have like superpowers in this game.
[168:19.11]This is wild.
[168:32.70]Is it my turn?
[168:37.46]I think it's my turn.
[169:06.41]Finish them.
[169:09.28]Huh?
[169:15.96]Well, Sid.
[169:17.82]Okay.
[169:18.24]This is not three against one.
[169:31.84]Super move incoming.
[169:44.26]I'm going for a limit break right after this.
[170:06.39]6300 damage.
[170:06.89]Ooh, that hurt.
[170:13.90]Ooh, I'm getting combo'd.
[170:33.91]Again!
[170:46.20]Those actually aren't, those are not easy to hit.
[171:20.32]Do not stand in that.
[171:22.58]I got it.
[171:23.14]There's one down.
[171:46.62]She doesn't look happy, Toggle.
[171:48.52]come on oh my goodness I got hit by that this has got to be the end right here
[172:16.94]Alright, die!
[172:17.78]Got it.
[172:26.25]Okay.
[172:26.45]I had the rings on.
[172:27.51]It's fine.
[172:28.47]That was still fun.
[172:31.83]Level 13.
[172:32.03]So that's not that much further.
[172:34.27]What are we?
[172:34.63]Level 6 or 7 or something?
[172:39.28]Cool.
[172:41.36]Crafting.
[172:52.85]Is this the full version?
[172:54.59]This is not the full version.
[172:55.69]This is part of the demo.
[172:57.05]When you beat the demo, you can come back and do this little dungeon area.
[173:00.47]It's like a little snippet of the game.
[173:10.33]Why are you doing this to us?
[173:13.01]What, like showing you a fucking cool-ass game?
[173:15.55]You have to wait a little bit longer?
[173:17.83]Heh heh.
[173:31.51]Benedicta will be on her way to collect the Dominant, if she hasn't already.
[173:38.20]You can't afford to let them leave.
[173:40.58]Remember, she has wings, you don't.
[173:43.62]What about you?
[173:45.70]Before or after I catch my breath.
[173:47.20]I'll be fine.
[173:48.36]It's the demo, for God's sake.
[173:49.48]I'm not going to do a main character death in a demo.
[173:53.56]What are you, out of your mind?
[173:54.80]Come on, Toggle.
[173:59.53]It's just the demo.
[174:02.22]Can't die in the demo, you know?
[174:03.58]It'd be funny if in the main game he actually has a death scene right here, but they replaced it.
[174:26.73]Dog still here?
[174:31.28]She must be here somewhere.
[174:32.50]Dude, they've killed like 50 people in the demo.
[174:35.92]That's yeah, that's true.
[174:50.81]But were they lore characters?
[174:55.44]They kind of were.
[175:05.22]So, some opponents will cast Cure spells to heal their allies.
[175:09.82]Defeat these spellcasters first to prevent a drawn out battle.
[175:12.17]Or I could just smush everybody.
[175:29.50]Killed the caster last.
[175:48.01]Take the rings off.
[175:50.22]But it's alright.
[175:51.42]It's alright.
[175:53.74]When I play this, I'm not going to play with the rings on, but we're just checking it out.
[175:58.86]I didn't play the demo with the rings on.
[176:00.20]Wow.
[176:00.84]Beautiful sky.
[176:05.59]That's cool, though.
[176:06.69]You know, that's kind of cool.
[176:11.46]There's a feature in the game where if you just want to kind of relax, chill out, watch the story, and just kill stuff, that's cool.
[176:20.01]You just put the ring on if you want to do that.
[176:21.61]There's no pressure to do or not to do it.
[176:33.64]Actually, let me do...
[176:52.30]Is there a food mode?
[176:54.14]That?
[176:55.70]I don't know if I would call that food mode.
[177:04.59]Somebody said, I don't know if I'm going to spend all the money on the console and the game, which is hundreds of dollars to just turn on food mode.
[177:17.05]Yeah, I mean, if you... But food mode is available.
[177:36.62]Okay.
[177:42.98]I wonder how much longer this is.
[177:45.68]I am supposed to be dead.
[177:52.33]Wait, where's like the healer?
[177:54.47]No, just group them all up.
[177:55.39]Ooh, don't hurt me.
[178:29.69]There's a lot of people in this room.
[178:48.71]Oh, I just blew his head up.
[178:49.67]Dude, you still haven't killed the fucking healer.
[178:54.27]Where's the healer?
[178:55.35]Alright, you.
[178:57.81]Sorry about that.
[179:01.05]That's a good way to juggle.
[179:08.79]What if I charge this?
[179:36.58]You still sculpting?
[179:38.72]Off and on, yeah.
[179:40.48]I've been kind of busy lately, so... Limit break!
[180:21.76]Daggered.
[180:22.44]Oh, he's dead.
[180:28.02]Oh my god, if he's not charged.
[180:57.30]Bring it all together now.
[180:58.20]Ow.
[181:30.55]Woohoo!
[181:36.13]This is a pretty beefy demo.
[181:41.96]Now where?
[181:55.60]probably a long game I think most of the final fantasies are pretty long there's a lot of content in them usually how long was the last one like Final Fantasy 15 like how if you just did the main campaign and just kind of went through it give or take how many hours today would take to do
[182:31.36]Like 70, 50?
[182:32.24]Yeah, it's probably pretty similar.
[182:34.46]They're like about 40 or so.
[182:39.42]Final Fantasy 14 is like 80 hours.
[182:56.79]Alright, let's see.
[182:57.51]One of the boss fights in the game.
[182:58.59]If you don't want to see the boss, if you don't want to see what this boss looks like when you fight this... I'm imagining we're about to fight this boss.
[183:07.58]We'll clock out.
[183:11.36]I confess I expected more from the old man.
[183:14.40]Final Fantasy XIV is like 400 hours.
[183:18.85]And less from you.
[183:20.73]This is the second time you've bested my sisters.
[183:25.36]Men of your talents are rare indeed.
[183:27.48]400.
[183:28.02]Oh, it's an MMO.
[183:29.04]Alright, yeah, yeah.
[183:30.08]If there's a hearth you long for, you will find more than enough warmth under my wings.
[183:38.23]You know exactly what I want.
[183:41.33]Hand over the Dominant, and I'll leave you in peace.
[183:45.27]You would dare to make demands of me.
[183:50.09]Know your place, little lamb.
[183:53.41]Fool is a shepherd who he eats every bleed of the flock.
[183:58.68]And I will suffer yours no longer.
[184:01.78]Here we go.
[184:04.82]I spell it out for you.
[184:06.06]Branded.
[184:06.64]Let's see.
[184:07.70]I'm ready.
[184:08.60]Ready to see it.
[184:10.44]No one at all.
[184:15.44]Come little lamb to the slaughter with you.
[184:22.64]okay come on come this time
[185:06.96]Oh, what does that mean?
[185:09.38]Okay.
[185:19.59]This is going to kill her.
[185:20.47]This is going to literally kill her.
[185:24.41]Stop spraying the air.
[185:34.47]Oh shit, that hurt.
[185:38.09]Okay.
[185:38.29]Scripted.
[185:38.65]Where is he?
[185:42.85]No more task again.
[186:02.53]Now it's for the real fight.
[186:27.35]Wait.
[186:29.39]Oh, we're good.
[186:36.06]Toggle!
[186:36.58]Hey!
[186:40.72]Okay...
[187:06.70]I'll take a precise dodge any day.
[187:22.85]Oops.
[187:23.75]Oh shit.
[187:54.47]Again.
[188:01.60]Get down from there.
[188:02.38]I gotta charge it up.
[188:14.50]You land, I'm gonna limit break and you're dead.
[188:23.71]Okay Ow There it is
[188:51.68]Almost 10k.
[188:52.20]Bramble fall.
[189:20.80]If you fail that quick time event, you just die.
[189:24.24]I love the music changes.
[189:37.74]I gotta get over 10,000 right here.
[190:03.37]Torvald's definitely coming back.
[190:17.06]That worked.
[190:26.77]I'm alright, I just... My legs are broken.
[190:37.97]Jesus.
[190:42.19]Oh my god.
[190:53.48]Sick of total...
[191:06.94]It should be like 15,000.
[191:20.51]Whoa.
[191:31.96]Dude, I'm fucking dodging every single thing.
[191:34.30]I don't care if I get the rings on.
[191:35.50]This is fun.
[191:53.70]That hurt a lot.
[192:17.44]This is it.
[192:30.72]Alright.
[192:33.05]That's definitely it.
[192:33.83]I don't want to look at anything else.
[192:40.17]Based easy mode.
[192:41.87]Just for the demo.
[192:43.27]It's alright.
[192:45.94]We just wanted to see what was possible.
[192:51.12]Curious to find out who he's talking about?
[193:21.24]The full game comes out on June 22nd.
[193:27.02]Uncover the mysteries of Final Fantasy XVI, Clive, Cid, and Torgl.
[193:34.25]Their journey does not end here.
[193:37.83]On the PlayStation 5, home entertainment console.
[194:11.61]Cool.
[194:12.05]Alright.
[194:12.39]I'm down.
[194:13.81]Alright, guys.
[194:21.05]That's going to be it.
[194:22.99]That was Final Fantasy 16's demo.
[194:24.57]It is available right now.
[194:25.51]You can go grab it if you want on the PlayStation 5 store.
[194:27.99]Thank you, Square Enix, for sponsoring this segment of the stream.
[194:32.46]I had a lot of fun.
[194:35.50]Just a little taste before the launch.
[194:43.73]It's a good place to start, too, I would imagine, because I, honestly, I'm kind of starting with Final Fantasy 16.
[194:49.93]It's been a very long time since I've cared about the franchise at all.
[194:55.80]A very long time.
[194:57.94]The last time I really played a Final Fantasy game, honestly, it has to be back in the Super Nintendo.
[195:03.36]And then a little bit, maybe, I want to say, like, a little of 7, a little bit, a little bit of 10, but not really.
[195:15.52]So it's a good place to start.
[195:19.06]But yeah, that concludes the stream tonight.
[195:22.71]Besides the sponsor, obviously the big news about me joining off-brand.
[195:27.15]I'm really excited, guys.
[195:28.11]I just, I truly am.
[195:30.09]I know we fuck around a lot on this stream, but I hope I can put some, uh, I hope I can just put some effort, try to make some good stuff.
[195:42.34]joining what if you Okay, if you those of you just joining I have been appointed as chief creative officer of off brand, which is Ludwig's company is media company.
[195:56.30]So I'll be working a lot with Ludwig.
[195:58.16]And obviously the rest of those guys.
[196:00.98]I think we're gonna do a lot of really cool stuff.
[196:04.80]I hope so I'm gonna try.
[196:07.84]But
[196:09.36]Thanks for watching.
[196:10.02]Thanks for sticking around.
[196:11.96]There will be way more information on this as I get started, as I keep going.
[196:15.87]I know a lot of people were like, holy shit, he's retiring.
[196:19.71]The answer is, no, I'm not.
[196:22.17]I'm still streaming.
[196:22.87]I'm still going to be here.
[196:23.61]I'm still hanging out.
[196:25.27]But I will have other duties that I have to do in between streaming.
[196:29.09]So there will be times when I tell you, hey, I got a lot going on with Offbrand.
[196:33.16]I'll see you in like a week or two.
[196:35.00]You know what I mean?
[196:35.58]Like, it's not, I'm not going anywhere.
[196:39.66]And I do that shit anyways.
[196:41.38]Like, I do it all the time anyways.
[196:46.69]So.
[196:49.11]Kind of, the whole thing's coming together as the big picture of the future of my life, I guess.
[196:58.32]But, thanks everybody.
[197:00.72]It's impossible to be in a position like this without having all of you kind of hold up the Earth.
[197:08.75]So I really appreciate it.
[197:09.67]Anybody, if you've watched this channel for a minute, an hour, 10 years, if you just came to the channel and you said, this guy sucks, fuck this guy, you still were here.
[197:18.83]So thanks.
[197:19.63]Thanks for hanging out, regardless of how you feel.
[197:23.44]I did not ever think that I would be looking at announcements like this.
[197:29.21]But I'm going to step up.
[197:30.15]I'm going to try to.
[197:30.71]We'll see what happens.
[197:31.97]I'm going to put my effort into it, so let's go.
[197:35.21]The Jerma employed arc.
[197:37.43]That's right.
[197:38.11]That's true.
[197:40.86]Actually employed now.
[197:49.78]But yeah.
[197:50.74]Thanks a lot, everybody.
[197:52.26]I'll see you guys soon.
[197:52.98]Next stream will probably be... I want to say maybe like Wednesday or Thursday.
[198:01.88]Let's shoot for Wednesday.
[198:04.46]I do want to play the Zoombinis.
[198:09.28]No, you know what?
[198:09.72]Thursday.
[198:10.66]Make it Thursday.
[198:12.82]We'll do Thursday and like Saturday this week.
[198:19.39]Same time?
[198:19.77]Yeah, like 4 o'clock.
[198:20.79]4 Pacific.
[198:24.57]We are definitely going to get sick of the Zoombinis in probably an hour and a half, so there'll be something else to do too.
[198:34.40]The giraffe tweet?
[198:35.14]I'll go over the giraffe tweet when we stream next.
[198:37.82]Tell me to go over the giraffe tweet.
[198:40.76]And then sorceries will be right after that.
[198:46.96]Thank you again, Square Enix.
[198:48.40]Thanks for watching.
[198:49.02]I had a really great time.
[198:52.76]Looking forward to playing it.
[198:59.05]Have a great night.
[199:07.22]He's choking up.
[199:08.04]No, I'm just burping.
[199:10.20]It's a small difference.
[199:25.78]When are you going to do the tuba stream?
[199:29.78]I probably said... I probably said that at some point, so...
[199:41.19]Burping is choking up.
[199:42.87]Yeah.
[199:49.87]What about infomercial streams?
[199:53.17]Well, the follow-up to the off-brand stuff, obviously, is... I made this comment a few times back in January, February.
[200:00.93]But... We're gonna be just doing whatever.
[200:07.21]I'm not gonna have, essentially...
[200:10.32]I kind of want to take some of the pressure away of, I got to figure out something to stream every day, every other day, whatever.
[200:19.95]And I think it's probably more fun to just like load up infomercials and just watch for a couple hours and hang out.
[200:28.85]Play something like Final Fantasy 16 and not be like, okay, well, I'm not going to do that again.
[200:33.15]You're going to see, you will see a lot more of that, like you already have.
[200:39.81]Yeah, I'm not stressing it.
[200:48.18]Can we do a Street Fighter 6 training arc stream?
[200:55.58]Maybe.
[200:57.14]Just do what you want.
[200:59.02]Yeah.
[201:01.99]Don't worry.
[201:04.27]I'm still in.
[201:05.11]I'm still in.
[201:08.68]Don't take the off-brand announcement that I'm out.
[201:11.63]I'm still in.
[201:22.15]You do you.
[201:25.81]He hates streaming.
[201:32.06]But yeah.
[201:34.54]Will there be less streams over the course of the next however long period?
[201:40.02]Yeah.
[201:41.54]I gotta be honest with you.
[201:42.68]Probably.
[201:44.52]I imagine there probably would be periods where there's a lot going on and there's a lot of stuff that I'm trying to do that I'm working on.
[201:51.08]But I'll come back.
[201:54.97]He's not denying it.
[201:55.91]No, there's not gonna be zero streams.
[201:59.65]I'm just saying that
[202:02.25]When a project is being worked on, I'll probably just be back in a couple weeks, just like it always is.
[202:13.23]It's a big change.
[202:14.19]You'll get used to it.
[202:14.74]Yeah, I mean, it is a big change.
[202:16.30]This is probably the biggest change in my personal life and work life for... It's been 12 years.
[202:24.66]Started doing YouTube.
[202:25.72]I just kind of got a following on YouTube.
[202:28.22]And I was like, oh, wait, I can make money doing this.
[202:31.22]That's weird.
[202:32.24]That seems like fucking impossible.
[202:35.12]And then I just kind of... Honestly, the Twitch... Moving to Twitch was probably the other one.
[202:42.59]So...
[202:44.26]It's going to be a lot to get used to.
[202:45.26]I know it will be, but we'll just take it as it comes.
[202:51.39]I'm not going anywhere.
[202:55.07]See you guys later.
[202:55.69]See you on Thursday.
[202:56.83]Have a great night.
[202:57.57]Thanks for watching.
[202:58.21]Thanks for sticking around during the sponsor segment.
[203:03.29]See you on Thursday.
[203:10.78]The future is bright.
[203:11.78]I'll see you really soon.
[203:18.12]Call your mother.
[204:00.35]Thank you.
