[ve:60.16.100]

[00:44.01]Hi guys.
[00:47.21]How you doing?
[00:49.55]Good?
[00:50.21]Okay.
[00:50.71]Nice.
[00:52.11]I'm okay.
[00:54.45]I'm a little bit on the ill side today.
[00:57.13]Kind of got a headache.
[00:58.77]And I have a little bit of a stomach thing going on.
[01:01.31]This little stomach thing, you know.
[01:03.59]So I apologize in advance if I'm not as energetic as I typically am.
[01:08.93]I'm going to have to get some sleep here.
[01:12.11]So, thanks for coming.
[01:13.07]I'll see you guys on... No, I'm kidding.
[01:14.67]I'm okay.
[01:16.91]We're going to do Darkest Dungeon again.
[01:19.52]I'm going to just continue right where we left off.
[01:22.82]Let me make a tweet first.
[01:23.94]Hold on.
[01:25.80]Did that work?
[01:27.20]Oh, shit.
[01:28.84]Yeah, it did.
[01:31.18]It's a puke stream?
[01:31.90]No, it's not going to be a puke stream.
[01:36.54]Look at my bills.
[01:40.90]Give me one second.
[01:41.50]I'm going to adjust a couple of sliders, and I will be with you guys shortly.
[02:12.43]It won't be a puke stream with that attitude.
[02:16.91]No, not with this one.
[02:19.59]But, yeah, let me tweet one out.
[02:22.85]Make sure this is in the right spot.
[02:26.78]You would unfollow me if I threw up in the stream.
[02:30.22]Isn't that a reason to follow somebody?
[02:32.12]You know what I mean?
[02:36.65]If I came to a stream, and the guy was playing Darkest Dungeon, he had a webcam on, and he just puked, I'd be like, holy shit, this is a follow.
[02:48.56]Because that means it might happen again.
[02:51.74]That means it could happen more than once.
[02:53.64]If he pukes on camera, who's to say that's that exact same scenario?
[02:58.29]He might shit on camera.
[02:59.69]I'm following that stream, just in case.
[03:01.27]You never know what's going to happen.
[03:04.52]Like, why would you want... I don't know why you'd want to watch... Never mind, just forget what I said.
[03:08.66]Let me just close this.
[03:14.92]Yank.
[03:15.26]That would be a follow, a sub, and a donation.
[03:25.45]Mind... Yeah, just turn on the mind eraser frog, we'll be fine.
[03:30.47]So, let's turn this off.
[03:32.99]Let's get over here.
[03:34.49]Oh, look at that.
[03:36.53]Hey, look, right where we left off last time.
[03:40.81]At the options menu.
[03:44.67]Is the audio on?
[03:46.15]No, it is not.
[03:46.97]Good thing I looked over.
[03:48.11]Otherwise, I would never have seen that.
[03:53.77]I couldn't wait until 7 to play Darkest Dungeon.
[03:56.39]I apparently got a blueprint.
[03:57.75]That means I have two blueprints, right?
[04:01.36]Where do I see my Blueprint number?
[04:03.56]Is that it?
[04:04.08]Didn't I get a Blueprint last time?
[04:06.20]I think this is just reminding me the last time I got a Blueprint.
[04:11.25]So, let me just, I wanna make this, uh, statement before we get going here.
[04:15.91]I don't really feel that well.
[04:18.01]I, like, wanna play Darkest Dungeon.
[04:20.03]But, I don't know, you might not see very many, like, there might not be much material here.
[04:23.57]Like, I might not, like, make any fucking jokes or references.
[04:27.07]I might just play the game.
[04:28.76]Because I've got, like, some stomach problems.
[04:30.14]I've got, like, a head, a head issue right now.
[04:32.98]So, not gonna, no, no, no, like, I'm not gonna, like, get a lot of energy in this stream.
[04:37.42]Is what I'm saying.
[04:37.84]This is gonna be a low energy stream.
[04:40.58]High octave gameplay, low energy.
[04:44.86]Usually we're the other side.
[04:45.74]Usually we're high energy, low octave gameplay.
[04:55.51]He has a head.
[04:56.81]Yes, I do.
[05:00.44]Yes, I do.
[05:03.57]I had it written right off the bat.
[05:05.89]That stream hadn't even been going for five minutes.
[05:08.54]Ben, this happened last time too.
[05:12.02]Yesterday, like, no, not yesterday.
[05:14.00]Not yesterday's weather.
[05:17.10]A hundred bucks from Ben Elnor.
[05:21.36]In the first five minutes, a hundred bucks was given last time too.
[05:24.83]So, thank you so much, Ben.
[05:27.95]That's 100 bucks.
[05:29.01]No message, just cheer.
[05:30.85]10,000, 10,000 bits.
[05:35.20]Make sure, I believe it's still going on, and if it's not, then I'm wrong, but make sure you're doing hashtag charity in your bits, messages, because I believe Twitch is going to give some money or they're going to take it, they're going to match proceeds for the Hurricane Harvey damage.
[05:55.14]So use hashtag charity when you do that.
[05:58.80]But Ben, a hundred fucking dollars, haven't even started,
[06:03.19]Gotta have to name a guy after Ben.
[06:04.83]You know what I mean?
[06:05.75]Who's this person?
[06:07.61]This is Ben.
[06:09.49]No, no, no, no, no.
[06:10.69]No, I already said that this is not going to happen last time.
[06:18.80]That's like a can of worms I don't want to open.
[06:21.36]But Ben, super, super, duper, thank you.
[06:25.16]Appreciate it.
[06:29.60]What's the best team composition?
[06:31.00]I don't even know.
[06:33.19]I really don't know.
[06:41.22]That's an old can of worms.
[06:44.08]Death and team recap.
[06:45.34]There have been no deaths.
[06:46.78]Not one.
[06:51.61]Absolutely not one person has died in my town.
[06:54.95]We're all still here.
[06:59.74]If you don't pick me, then you don't pick me.
[07:00.82]Alright, let's get going.
[07:02.24]Last thing that happened is we beat the first boss, the Necromancer's apprentice.
[07:08.91]We have a little bit of stuff to do, though.
[07:10.73]What is this?
[07:11.49]I want to keep him with rapies, right?
[07:13.77]Because I'm like a freak show and I want him to have more damage?
[07:15.59]Okay.
[07:18.41]So, let's just get started, then.
[07:22.38]Let's take a look at what we can do here.
[07:24.90]We can finally do a veteran mission, but we can't because we only have one guy that's level 3.
[07:30.73]Level two, level one.
[07:32.19]We could bring... Actually, I need to put some people in a... I gotta lock some people away.
[07:48.86]Meditation.
[07:50.38]That's fine.
[07:51.12]I gotta make sure I have a healer for this next thing.
[07:54.42]Which I do.
[07:55.60]Okay.
[07:56.48]And the stress is not that bad on this one, so that'll be fine.
[08:03.29]Do veteran, it's really easy.
[08:04.89]The veteran dungeons are actually kind of challenging.
[08:09.20]Can anybody else?
[08:09.90]You can't... Why are you not doing anything here?
[08:11.62]Come on.
[08:12.64]What about the tavern?
[08:13.34]You're gonna go in the tavern now?
[08:14.32]You don't even want... What's wrong with you?
[08:16.54]We'll only meditate.
[08:17.46]And this happened last time.
[08:20.35]So you know what?
[08:22.65]That's fine.
[08:23.67]We're bringing Etalyx.
[08:25.89]We're bringing hey Diffney Etalyx anyway, so it don't matter.
[08:29.43]Let's... I've already upgraded... No, no, no, no, no.
[08:32.24]Before... I'm trying to remember everything we did last time.
[08:35.72]I did not upgrade him, so I want to do that.
[08:37.86]It's something I absolutely want to do.
[08:40.46]Anybody else?
[08:40.96]Yep.
[08:45.03]I don't want to upgrade you, because you might just be a guy that dies immediately.
[08:54.88]The chat's getting philosophical.
[08:57.30]I'm in Darkest Dungeon, what is Gibney?
[08:59.35]Oh, Etalyx, last stream I said that this looked like you.
[09:03.91]It doesn't at all, but I was like, oh, Etalyx has a fucking mustache.
[09:08.11]So every single occultist has to have your name in it.
[09:11.23]So this is like somebody from chat, if you're curious.
[09:16.98]Have I changed my mind about the occultist?
[09:19.18]Not really, but kind of.
[09:20.50]Alright, let's go by level...
[09:25.04]You're good.
[09:25.84]You're... You know... You know... You know... You know... Bird Jerma needs to be... He's fine.
[09:32.48]Just want to make sure... The real Jerma... I think I want to get upgraded.
[09:40.05]Yeah.
[09:42.91]I don't know.
[09:43.27]I feel like I'm not going to take two lepers anytime soon.
[09:48.51]Alright.
[09:48.91]Save my money.
[09:49.45]Save the money.
[09:49.91]Save the money.
[09:50.31]I'm like going on a fucking spending spree right now.
[09:54.78]I have a lot of stuff to look at here.
[09:56.18]This is a lot of shit.
[09:58.76]Let's just do it.
[09:59.12]Let's do a mission.
[09:59.90]We'll come back to this.
[10:01.65]Let me see how I'm gonna even bring on this mission.
[10:04.69]So what do we got?
[10:05.23]We got... Look, I'm not doing the courtyard right now.
[10:09.30]Uh, so we already... We beat the boss here.
[10:12.26]Let's do this one because we're going to unlock the next boss here.
[10:14.71]So let's do this.
[10:15.59]It's a medium dungeon.
[10:16.77]I'm fine with that.
[10:17.39]So we're going to bring Etalyx.
[10:20.49]We are going to bring bird Jerma.
[10:22.55]We're going to bring spec tag.
[10:25.05]And we are... Actually, you know what?
[10:26.21]This time we're going to bring real Jerma too.
[10:29.94]Traveling circus.
[10:31.32]Perfect.
[10:33.68]Because I do need to level these both up.
[10:34.96]Make sure they're in the right spots.
[10:39.80]He wants to be somewhere else.
[10:42.40]Keep him back here.
[10:43.32]I want the ranged artillery.
[10:47.06]You stay back here too.
[10:50.72]You can stay here.
[10:54.55]Where am I going?
[10:59.35]Which is the place that has a lot of bleed resistance.
[11:03.15]The ruins don't bring bleed.
[11:06.49]Is Weld good for bleed?
[11:07.63]I don't remember.
[11:08.65]Why are we doing the Snaticats that are invisible?
[11:17.59]Cove is Blight Resistance, right?
[11:22.36]Why are we on Snaticat?
[11:25.88]What the fuck?
[11:28.58]I'm going to take the buff then.
[11:31.14]We'll go with the two songs.
[11:35.20]And the finale, that's fine.
[11:41.39]Can I recommend a good book?
[11:42.43]Yeah, sure.
[11:43.83]Read the Song of Ice and Fire.
[11:45.81]If you like Game of Thrones.
[11:46.63]Or if you like mystery, you know what I mean?
[11:49.47]It's a mystery.
[11:50.09]What you guys don't understand is... The Song of Ice and Fire is a mystery.
[12:02.21]That book is fucking boring.
[12:03.57]What?
[12:06.24]It is not boring.
[12:07.25]It's very... There's a lot going on there.
[12:10.49]Am I going to play this game off stream?
[12:11.63]Yes.
[12:12.93]I'm actually not feeling that great today.
[12:14.95]I'm feeling kind of sick.
[12:18.94]I just don't feel well.
[12:21.38]So I'm just going to chill and play Darkest Dungeon and hang out and talk with you guys.
[12:25.70]Tomorrow we're going to go back to PlayStation 3.
[12:28.26]I have a fucking storage unit full of PlayStation 3 games as you are aware.
[12:34.93]I'm going to take a lot of food.
[12:35.87]I'm scared.
[12:37.75]Let's take a couple of keys.
[12:38.79]A couple of shovels.
[12:40.91]Have a little additional herbs spices ecto cooler.
[12:45.09]No one bandage.
[12:46.21]Let's go Recommend another book The winds of winter are coming when Jerma uploads to his main channel uploaded to my main channel like six or seven eight days ago When's the winter ain't out yet?
[13:00.50]I'm okay with this.
[13:01.75]Complete 100% of rune battles.
[13:03.17]I don't have any scouting right now.
[13:05.07]I have to go this way.
[13:05.71]Because I have to.
[13:06.85]I have to.
[13:18.59]Hey, we started a little early today.
[13:21.89]And we got a fight.
[13:22.65]What we got?
[13:26.76]You guys know exactly what I'm gonna do with the leper.
[13:29.44]He just like, gets to kill.
[13:32.36]Instantly kill everybody in the front line, that's fine.
[13:34.18]Uh, you don't, you're fine.
[13:36.26]Just attack him.
[13:40.77]Mm-hmm.
[13:41.91]Ah, debuff him.
[13:43.61]Take away a little bit of that damage.
[13:48.63]Just put buff shamans in the brothel forever so I never die.
[13:53.59]Well, I don't know if I want to do that.
[13:58.09]Didn't even get hit once.
[14:00.67]Didn't even take one point of damage.
[14:07.54]So there was a room battle here, so that's a good thing.
[14:10.56]We're gonna go back row, right?
[14:11.82]Here we go.
[14:12.32]Yep.
[14:13.38]Throw that plague grenade.
[14:15.42]I want two... My final... My final team is gonna be two plague doctors.
[14:21.16]Everybody can tell me that that sucks.
[14:23.31]That's fine.
[14:24.17]Like, Jerma, you're a fucking idiot.
[14:25.75]You're never gonna beat the Darkest Dungeon on the extreme difficulty.
[14:28.63]Well, I don't care.
[14:29.23]You know what I mean?
[14:34.05]I don't like this.
[14:35.57]I don't like this.
[14:36.13]I don't like that I brought him.
[14:39.99]I like that though.
[14:41.85]I do like that.
[14:43.31]I like that too.
[14:45.09]And we can Q this.
[14:49.57]It's alright.
[14:51.75]It's a well played dot.
[14:55.64]Something about the dots.
[14:56.36]I love dots in any video game.
[14:57.46]One of my favorite characters of any video game I've ever had.
[15:01.04]Was the... What do I want to go through?
[15:04.30]Is this Finale?
[15:05.44]I guess I can do Finale on... Probably kill him.
[15:10.71]Uh, I... I... Jeremy hates himself?
[15:13.30]No, that's... Just because something says real doesn't mean it is real.
[15:19.55]But my favorite character like in any video game was the Affliction Warlock from World of Warcraft.
[15:25.46]And I'm not talking about the new Affliction Warlock after they ruined the class.
[15:29.90]I'm talking about like Wrath of the Lich King Affliction Warlock.
[15:34.98]I love dotting enemies.
[15:36.06]It's just so much fun to see like the... All the numbers.
[15:39.33]I love it.
[15:40.25]Ticking damage just gets me to a level that I can't explain.
[15:48.68]Alright, we got an heirloom chest.
[15:50.00]Let's use a lock and key.
[15:53.32]And we got a lot of things here.
[15:54.56]And I need those papers.
[15:55.46]Good.
[15:56.10]I like it.
[15:59.27]Now I gotta go back.
[16:00.87]Watch out for those traps!
[16:07.29]Um... I kinda... I kinda want it like this.
[16:16.26]Because he can't really do any of his moves.
[16:20.13]But then he can't... You know, it's not a great team.
[16:25.28]I guess he can be there, but then he'll have to move.
[16:29.44]No, that's alright.
[16:30.08]That's okay.
[16:30.56]I'm okay with that.
[16:32.58]I'm okay with that.
[16:33.16]I'll just have to do it like this.
[16:38.40]I'm not an idiot.
[16:39.08]I'm gonna defeat the Darkest Dungeon on extreme difficulty.
[16:42.06]No, I'm not.
[16:44.94]I'll be lucky if I'm playing this game, like, in, like, fucking six hours.
[16:52.54]This is what I wanted.
[16:59.79]Like this.
[17:00.61]That's pretty good.
[17:01.23]Pretty good.
[17:02.09]We can throw a stun on the guy in the back.
[17:07.30]I can't believe I'm watching 20 ads for you.
[17:12.33]Why are you watching that many ads?
[17:17.01]Have I read any other book besides The Great Gatsby and A Song of Ice and Fire?
[17:21.64]Yeah.
[17:21.98]I don't know.
[17:25.80]I think I read The Odyssey in high school because I had to.
[17:33.69]I was one of those kids in high school that I never read the passage we were supposed to read.
[17:38.51]So I was always terrified to get called on to talk about it.
[17:43.75]A grave.
[17:44.91]Let's dig that fucking grave.
[17:48.73]Ooh, look at that.
[17:50.33]Oh shit, I already have no rope.
[17:52.43]What about you?
[17:54.29]Can you take now?
[18:00.36]Shit.
[18:04.35]in radiance may we find victory yeah so I I uh I wouldn't you know it was always like nothing too I was always reading like like 14 pages and I wouldn't I wouldn't even do that I hated reading another abomination cleansed from our land goosebumps of the best literature ever book fairs were the but you know book fairs were cool because
[18:33.58]You walked around pretending like you were going to read the books that you're picking up.
[18:41.29]It's a signed reading.
[18:42.39]Another grave?
[18:42.85]I don't want to use that.
[18:48.13]What did I just do?
[19:02.25]I got a lot of these.
[19:05.99]And I don't think locking in traits is particularly a good thing to do.
[19:11.80]But yeah, I would be sitting in the seat.
[19:13.32]And it's a good thing I didn't do that.
[19:16.58]Teacher would call on you.
[19:17.78]You know, you're sitting there like, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[19:20.16]I didn't read anything.
[19:24.00]So I have no idea what the characters did or where they went.
[19:27.73]And you tried to bullshit your way through it if you got called on.
[19:30.15]So, um, when, uh... When Mortimer went down into the hallway and picked out the shrine, like, how did you think he was feeling?
[19:38.02]Uh, I mean, I... I mean, he probably felt really crushed at the gravity of the situation at hand.
[19:45.43]Uh, I really, like, I wish I... Here's what you do.
[19:48.33]Like, I'm gonna give you a fucking secret tip of how you, like, bullshit your way talking about, like, a signed reading.
[19:52.15]Go back...
[19:53.55]and allude to something that you already read.
[19:56.15]You know what I mean?
[19:57.09]Yeah, yeah, that was interesting.
[19:57.93]When he went into the shrine, that was really interesting.
[19:59.41]But you know what it reminds me of?
[20:01.01]Back, like, four chapters ago, the thing I actually read, four chapters ago, when he got in the fight with Cindy, and he threw the coffee at her, it reminded me of that, like, how he internally felt after that.
[20:12.74]That's how you do it.
[20:15.84]And then the teacher will think, like, oh, wow, you're, like, you're really comprehending all this information.
[20:19.66]No, you're just fucking lying.
[20:22.64]That's it.
[20:25.48]Ah, shit.
[20:25.92]He had a lot of resistance.
[20:26.82]I didn't pay attention.
[20:30.08]No, but good tips.
[20:34.83]Don't actually do this.
[20:39.89]I know.
[20:40.51]Don't actually do that.
[20:46.85]But if you find yourself in a desperate, desperate situation...
[20:51.13]Like if the teacher called on you and said you were gonna get an F. If you didn't answer this question the way she was expecting.
[20:56.79]Bingo.
[20:57.91]You got yourself an F to turn.
[21:00.61]Are these guys all Blight-resistant?
[21:01.85]Yeah, they are.
[21:02.81]I don't want to stun you because I don't want you marking people, please.
[21:14.95]What the fuck?
[21:15.47]What is he just doing?
[21:16.43]I didn't even look.
[21:17.37]105% stun resistance.
[21:18.15]What am I thinking?
[21:20.64]Stop talking about, like, cheating in high school and, like, attack people.
[21:24.39]For Christ's sake.
[21:32.05]Damn it.
[21:33.39]A friend of mine completely bullshitted a Sherlock Holmes report.
[21:41.78]It is possible.
[21:42.58]I don't think that's possible.
[21:49.63]Alright.
[21:49.95]Stunned!
[21:50.45]You know what?
[21:50.91]It doesn't even matter.
[21:51.99]You know what?
[21:52.52]105% it doesn't even matter.
[21:53.86]Got it.
[21:55.12]You can say what you want.
[21:56.66]Got it.
[22:01.78]I don't want to eat any food because I need to like camp eventually here.
[22:08.02]And I'm already like out of fucking torches.
[22:13.61]Shit!
[22:16.13]God damn it.
[22:16.91]What?
[22:19.94]Oh, that's great.
[22:20.96]Okay.
[22:21.52]Cool.
[22:21.96]Thanks.
[22:24.08]I'm gonna camp up here.
[22:25.84]If I can make it to here without camping, I'll be happy.
[22:32.06]Good.
[22:33.46]This next room is just... There's no fights here.
[22:35.76]I can just go.
[22:37.89]Left luggage is trapped.
[22:41.99]I gotta be using more of my items for this shit.
[22:44.89]I really do.
[22:51.29]I have no idea what this game is.
[22:52.19]This is Darkest Dungeon.
[22:54.31]It's very, very fun.
[22:56.23]Hey.
[22:58.41]Come on, you kleptomaniac.
[23:01.51]There's nobody in this room.
[23:02.43]This is fine.
[23:04.91]The healer got a disease that reduces his heals.
[23:06.89]Yeah, it sucks.
[23:08.51]Alright, if there is a fight in this next room, we're going to camp.
[23:11.61]Not camping yet.
[23:12.29]We do have an obstacle, though.
[23:13.25]That's not good.
[23:13.75]But who cares?
[23:14.11]We're going to rip it off with our bare hands.
[23:15.49]Because I don't have any shovels left.
[23:21.94]So much stress.
[23:25.47]That's so much stress damage.
[23:27.09]You know, there's one thing I don't like about this game.
[23:30.07]It's the fact that putting your hands on twigs and pulling a tree down is apparently the most stressful thing you can do in a dungeon.
[23:39.50]That's like some of the most stress damage in the whole game.
[23:44.51]Alright, come on.
[23:46.37]Secret room!
[23:47.73]Okay, got it.
[23:48.23]I know what this is.
[23:48.79]It's just like Binding of Isaac.
[23:51.11]We got a crit success with our scouting.
[23:53.45]So that means I get to this area and I can go in the back.
[23:56.62]And I can open up the chest with a key and get mad shit.
[23:59.48]You know what I mean?
[24:02.44]I can make it to the next room.
[24:04.74]Secret room.
[24:05.42]Check this out.
[24:05.94]Ready?
[24:06.64]Bingo.
[24:08.74]Got a box here.
[24:09.46]Ancient artifact.
[24:10.42]Sure thing.
[24:11.54]We're gonna get a ton of stuff here.
[24:14.45]Okay, this is actually really fucking rare to get this stuff at the same time.
[24:24.41]Plus 25% damage.
[24:27.46]Holy sheep shit.
[24:30.30]Plus 20% protection, but they both have more stress and less HP.
[24:34.16]Alright, that's freaking good.
[24:35.28]Alright, what am I throwing away?
[24:37.44]I gotta take a couple of torches.
[24:41.16]What do I... Ah!
[24:43.54]Just throw away the antivetum.
[24:48.50]Who do I give this to right now?
[24:49.47]Should I just give it to the leper?
[24:50.39]Both of them to the leper?
[24:54.43]Hmm.
[24:57.65]Damn it.
[24:58.11]That's... These things are so good.
[25:00.09]Ah!
[25:03.07]What does he have on?
[25:04.13]Plus 10% damage, minus 20% stress.
[25:07.83]I'm going to take this off.
[25:08.69]I'm going to replace this with this one.
[25:10.05]Because this counteracts this.
[25:13.00]And I'm just getting more damage.
[25:15.70]So, like... Wait, is this, like, permanent or something?
[25:17.92]No.
[25:19.06]Oh, baby.
[25:22.00]Who's getting the other one?
[25:22.82]20% protection?
[25:24.77]Oh, baby.
[25:29.01]It's just a stress problem.
[25:30.59]I'm going to go with the healer.
[25:34.23]Who cares if he stresses out?
[25:35.29]Fucking deal with it.
[25:36.69]We all have stress in our lives.
[25:38.03]You know what I mean?
[25:38.45]Like, deal with it.
[25:40.99]And then this is just 10% to damage skills.
[25:42.99]Let's just give it to the Jester.
[25:48.76]Okay.
[25:50.72]Deal with it.
[25:52.38]That's actually really, really good.
[25:54.38]That's very surprising that I got that.
[25:57.06]That's a really good roll to get that shit.
[26:00.46]Okay, let's go.
[26:04.96]You know, I had stress this morning.
[26:07.63]I got stuck in traffic this morning.
[26:11.03]Stress.
[26:12.85]But every time I get stuck in traffic, I always just sit there and I'm just like... I'm just like, how is it possible that this many people are going to the same place at the same time?
[26:22.98]You ever think about that?
[26:23.54]You ever, like, think about where everyone's going, like, on the road?
[26:27.12]Like, there are fucking thousands of cars all driving in the same direction.
[26:32.50]Where are they going?
[26:33.12]Like, where are you going?
[26:37.38]No, I don't, I don't, one of these days, I swear to God I'm gonna do this.
[26:40.46]One of these days, I'm going to, like, just roll down my window and, like, beep in traffic.
[26:46.13]The guy's gonna roll his window down.
[26:47.47]He's gonna think I'm gonna scream at him.
[26:48.59]I'm not.
[26:48.93]I'm gonna go, hey, dude, like, what are you doing?
[26:50.41]Like, where, where, where, tell me where you're going right now.
[26:53.65]Oh, yeah, you know, I'm going to visit my mother, and I'm gonna beep, and I'm gonna fucking roll my window up on her.
[26:57.60]You know what I mean?
[27:00.00]I'm not gonna be mean to him.
[27:01.92]I'm just, you know what I mean?
[27:02.84]I just...
[27:05.50]Because where are you going?
[27:06.10]And I'm going to do it to the guy next to me.
[27:08.63]I want all four quadrants of car to tell me where they're going.
[27:16.07]Every person you meet has their own life and their own responsibilities.
[27:20.27]But it's just crazy that there's that many people on the road.
[27:23.53]Think about that.
[27:24.86]Think about how many cars are on the road right now.
[27:30.98]It ain't Christmas.
[27:32.32]Like, every time I get in traffic, I always say the same thing.
[27:34.36]I go, it ain't fucking Christmas.
[27:37.24]It's not the holidays.
[27:39.04]It's like a Thursday morning.
[27:41.12]Like, and we're talking after rush hour, by the way.
[27:43.99]Not like work traffic.
[27:45.55]This was like fucking 12 o'clock in the afternoon.
[27:49.27]This ain't Christmas.
[27:50.49]Where are you all going?
[27:51.17]I don't understand.
[27:53.13]I don't understand.
[28:01.04]It's always Christmas.
[28:05.57]Let's just try to get rid of this frontline quick.
[28:09.70]People have things to do.
[28:10.60]I know, but did you guys imagine like how many people have things to do?
[28:14.07]It's crazy.
[28:17.75]This ain't Thanksgiving.
[28:19.35]Like, I understand.
[28:20.23]People have things to do, but it ain't Thanksgiving.
[28:22.83]We're not loading all of our kids in the car and going to Thanksgiving.
[28:26.40]I would understand.
[28:27.00]I would completely get it.
[28:29.46]And this fucking... That guy had a dickload of stuff.
[28:31.40]No, he didn't.
[28:32.06]I'm fine.
[28:32.34]I'm fine.
[28:38.22]It's like, wow, it's like everyone lives their own lives.
[28:40.24]No, I know, but I'm just, like, saying it's a lot of people.
[28:44.72]It ain't Halloween.
[28:45.54]Oh, we're gonna do this.
[28:55.89]He's getting there, you know what I mean?
[29:07.92]Jerma surprises a lot of people.
[29:09.94]No, it's not that I'm surprised.
[29:11.98]I'm just curious as to where everyone's going.
[29:14.84]What's this story?
[29:16.92]I'm gonna get on like Vice.
[29:17.76]You know what I mean?
[29:19.48]It's gonna be like, oh, traffic stories.
[29:22.04]It'll be like on Viceland.
[29:24.76]That'll be a fucking... Everyone will talk about how great of a show it is.
[29:28.01]I'll get so much praise.
[29:30.93]Well, traffic stories.
[29:32.05]It's an enlightening show.
[29:34.43]JeremyGerma985 rolls his window down and asks strangers where they're going and what they're doing in their life.
[29:42.48]Oh, let's just heal him.
[29:47.95]I feel the dragon freeze quick.
[29:55.81]Do you think they think the same thing about me?
[29:58.11]I think so.
[29:59.35]I'm just waiting for some guy to roll his window down and be like, hey, who the fuck are you going?
[30:04.00]And I'm just like, yes, pull over on the next exit.
[30:07.44]I want to have a fucking coffee with you.
[30:10.32]And then I crash into the guy in front of me.
[30:17.21]I really needed to kill the people in the back first, but they're resistant to blight and I can't do anything about them.
[30:26.67]Um, fuck.
[30:28.57]I have to just try.
[30:32.41]Got it.
[30:32.95]I got it.
[30:33.29]It's okay.
[30:33.59]We got it.
[30:38.65]Stun them?
[30:39.19]I mean, he has the stun, but I have to be in, like, the certain... Sorry, I tried.
[30:43.41]Okay.
[30:54.94]I'm gonna cause like a pot... No, I'm not.
[30:58.56]I can't even... I can't hit him.
[31:01.14]No.
[31:02.42]Well.
[31:04.36]That really blew it.
[31:08.40]Gonna have to like wait.
[31:11.88]No, not anymore.
[31:13.16]I played that really bad, but it's okay.
[31:19.50]Were we late today?
[31:20.22]We were not late.
[31:21.02]We were actually early today.
[31:24.79]But I'm so concerned about light and I just stacked it twice on him.
[31:27.28]Come on.
[31:28.96]What the hell am I doing?
[31:31.94]Go back here.
[31:33.58]There.
[31:35.04]Yeah.
[31:35.52]Yeah.
[31:36.04]Yeah.
[31:36.60]Yeah.
[31:38.03]Activated.
[31:39.51]Contents of mine.
[31:42.75]And I have one more torch.
[31:43.87]I don't want to use it because I'm going to get light.
[31:45.87]A full blast of light.
[31:47.51]So we're going to have to get rid of the...
[31:56.27]Uh, just, just fucking rank it.
[31:58.61]I'm gonna be camping in a second anyways.
[32:00.15]Uh, let's camp right here.
[32:02.67]Let's eat some food.
[32:07.24]Okay, camping skills.
[32:10.00]Alright, I don't want to do that.
[32:16.84]Nobody really needs anything.
[32:17.82]Let's do some buffs.
[32:20.89]Plus 10 attack rating and plus 5% crit.
[32:23.29]Let's give it to him.
[32:26.96]Everyone's fine.
[32:28.82]Remove blight, remove disease.
[32:30.30]Okay, wait, wait.
[32:31.38]Somebody's like throwing up, right?
[32:32.36]This guy is.
[32:37.18]Got rid of that.
[32:37.86]Disease cured.
[32:38.98]Right?
[32:39.90]Gone.
[32:40.40]Good.
[32:42.30]What do you got?
[32:42.78]Anything else?
[32:46.72]One companion, 50%.
[32:47.28]Let's just give it to you again.
[32:51.14]What else you got?
[32:52.00]What else you got?
[32:52.64]Uh...
[32:58.65]Alright, that's good.
[32:59.79]One more.
[33:00.50]One more.
[33:03.04]One more!
[33:04.98]Let's do this too.
[33:06.89]And that's it.
[33:07.65]Hopefully nobody attacks us in the night.
[33:09.51]Because if they attack us in the night, then we're gonna be in trouble.
[33:17.00]I do remove disease on myself.
[33:18.38]I wish I could.
[33:19.64]I just think I'm... I'm just off.
[33:21.82]I'm pitch black.
[33:25.70]Thank God it's the two easiest enemies in the whole game.
[33:28.95]But not good that I got startled.
[33:30.41]I should have moved backwards.
[33:42.22]That's it.
[33:42.62]That's our.
[33:43.40]Okay.
[33:44.56]Easiest enemy in the game.
[33:45.34]Now we get a full blast.
[33:47.71]Let's move you back to where you're supposed to be.
[33:49.69]Put the party in the right areas.
[33:52.97]Thank you very much.
[33:55.73]Wrong.
[33:57.51]Wrong.
[33:59.65]It's all wrong.
[34:01.99]Nothing must be left undisturbed.
[34:03.29]Oh well.
[34:07.39]Disarm me.
[34:07.94]Hey!
[34:16.62]Map pack.
[34:18.32]We got the Call of Duty DLC map pack.
[34:21.78]That's one.
[34:22.26]I think that's probably it.
[34:30.42]What do you got?
[34:31.46]Shambler?
[34:32.06]Jesus Christ, what do you mean Shambler?
[34:33.31]What the hell are you guys talking about?
[34:35.87]Jesus Christ, no.
[34:36.97]What?
[34:38.60]What are you guys on about right now?
[34:40.19]And I fucking should have been paying attention, not reading the chat room, when I need to watch out for traps that burn my feet.
[34:46.93]Ooh.
[34:51.65]Poundmaster.
[34:53.77]Got a lot of good shit, though.
[34:55.51]Just take this.
[34:56.95]I want to load up on these.
[34:59.47]Uh... Troubling Ifigi.
[35:02.42]An unsettling Ifigi erected in service to a mystery.
[35:04.88]I just had holy water.
[35:07.38]So, I don't... God damn it.
[35:12.64]You know what?
[35:13.00]I actually read a few things about... I tried to do a little bit more research.
[35:16.66]Like, you shouldn't just be touching everything in this game.
[35:19.40]Right?
[35:19.88]Like, I'm so compulsive.
[35:21.01]I touch everything.
[35:21.83]I shouldn't be doing that.
[35:24.65]Right?
[35:29.98]How is... Is that bird Jirba, but real Jirba is also here?
[35:34.66]Yeah.
[35:36.35]I know.
[35:36.67]Everyone's fine.
[35:38.87]This is not good.
[35:43.87]And... This is fine.
[35:45.51]You guys are gonna make it anyways, so we're good.
[35:50.92]Stress pool.
[35:52.48]This is it.
[35:54.46]We're good.
[35:55.88]Touch everything.
[35:57.26]I thought... I don't think that's what I should be doing, though.
[36:04.01]I fucked up the timeline.
[36:05.33]Well, I didn't mean to.
[36:06.51]That guy's dead anyways, but it doesn't matter.
[36:16.24]Go get the runs again.
[36:19.68]This will kill him if it lands.
[36:24.38]And he's dead.
[36:25.93]So now we can just debuff him and lap him.
[36:31.72]Alright, I don't need to take the holy water, but I want this gem.
[36:41.71]Can I move anything?
[36:44.25]3,500 gold pieces.
[36:44.93]Oh, let's open this.
[36:54.86]Coffin contains hidden treasures.
[36:56.24]Damn, I can't take $100.
[36:57.68]Shit.
[37:02.84]These sell for 5 gold each.
[37:04.48]They sell back for 5 gold.
[37:07.34]So we might as well just get rid of these.
[37:10.52]So just eat up.
[37:13.64]Yeah, here.
[37:14.44]I just gave the dead guy some food.
[37:20.75]Eat it up.
[37:21.59]This is my favorite part about beating a dungeon.
[37:34.13]Thank you to the Ask Green Man for two bucks.
[37:37.05]Puke for more bits.
[37:38.48]Thank you.
[37:39.70]King Roy, thanks for the five dollars.
[37:41.46]You stream, make laughs.
[37:43.30]I love you, Jerma.
[37:45.96]You stream, make me laugh.
[37:46.96]I love you.
[37:47.26]Well, thanks a lot.
[37:48.56]Thank you, King, for the five dollars.
[37:50.26]Appreciate it.
[37:50.92]Again, King with five dollars.
[37:52.70]I forgot charity.
[37:53.52]Hashtag charity.
[37:54.46]Nice stream, cool boy.
[37:56.10]Thank you for the ten dollars total.
[37:57.74]Hashtag charity on your bit messages, please.
[38:00.26]Hashtag charity.
[38:02.44]Thank you so much.
[38:04.54]Uh, Yak, Yak Rad, Silk Rad, thanks for the $1.
[38:11.01]Hashtag charity, internet went out, but it's back to see you play this nice game.
[38:15.41]Hashtag bird Jerma.
[38:17.65]No, thank you.
[38:18.61]Appreciate it.
[38:20.73]Uh, this is a great game.
[38:22.13]I am having a lot of fun.
[38:23.87]Satanic Santa, thanks for the $2.
[38:25.23]Jerma, your shoe is untied.
[38:26.45]Well, interesting.
[38:28.35]Ah, bare feet.
[38:30.90]Sorry about that.
[38:32.83]Satanic Santa, but thank you for the $2 regardless.
[38:34.77]Sir Feline, thanks for the $3.
[38:36.69]Don't forget to name the next Crusader Dens.
[38:39.99]I will, I will.
[38:40.99]Don't worry.
[38:42.54]But thank you for the $3.
[38:44.04]Spotty, thanks for the $4.
[38:45.94]Good job, Jerma.
[38:46.66]You got those little slug things good.
[38:48.58]Cheer 100, cheer 100, cheer 100, cheer, cheer, cheer, cheer, cheer.
[38:51.18]Thank you.
[38:52.66]HyenaDip, SaitroGhost, and OhSureYaDo.
[38:57.04]Thank you for the bits as well.
[38:58.58]Hey buddy, where you going?
[38:59.38]I gotta get home and stream video games.
[39:02.46]Oh, a hyena dip.
[39:03.40]Well, I'm here.
[39:05.00]I'm currently here.
[39:09.06]I currently have bare... Yeah, I currently have bare feet.
[39:13.90]Dud hitter.
[39:15.56]That's not great.
[39:17.30]That's alright.
[39:19.18]Couple of earrings.
[39:20.92]10% damage range skills.
[39:24.04]Eh, I don't have any range skills.
[39:26.28]And this guy's a co-phobe.
[39:28.92]Yep.
[39:32.36]What dictates being able to scout?
[39:35.06]You know, I actually have no idea.
[39:37.16]I think it's like certain things, like certain party members have a better chance to activate it.
[39:42.04]And you can get it from trinkets too, I think.
[39:45.08]Speaking of trinkets, I need to do some trinket knowledge here.
[39:48.95]Because they're... These guys didn't even get any stress at all.
[39:54.27]Do I have... I almost can do a veteran.
[40:00.59]Oh, wait, we can do a boss now though.
[40:04.39]This is the wizened hag.
[40:09.35]Should we go for the wizened hag?
[40:10.43]What have we got for a team here?
[40:11.77]This is an apprentice dungeon.
[40:14.99]What do we got for, uh... What do we got for, like, classes and shit?
[40:19.82]Um... I can bring... No, I can't.
[40:21.96]I can't.
[40:23.32]See, here... Okay, here's the thing with Darkest Dungeon.
[40:25.24]So... Uh, now that this guy's level 3... He physically CAN NOT do a dungeon that is not one of these.
[40:34.38]He will not... He refuses to go back and do a dungeon that's below level 3.
[40:40.82]So that's why I like Time Machine 9 is now going to be kind of in the sitting in the in the saddle for a little while.
[40:46.66]So we have to beat this with some shitties.
[40:53.31]The wise and hag, she's wise.
[40:58.46]So let's try it.
[40:59.34]Let's try to kill her.
[41:01.63]Let's get a decent team.
[41:02.49]I have no idea what the fuck she is or what she does.
[41:06.73]But I'm gonna... Might as well bring Bird Jerma.
[41:09.95]Fuck, wait a minute.
[41:10.79]He's level 3.
[41:11.93]Oh, shit.
[41:12.77]Oh, no.
[41:15.77]Okay, you can come again.
[41:19.58]You could come too, but... I don't know if I want you there.
[41:24.10]I think I'm gonna take some ranged.
[41:28.80]Yeah, but does she have bare feet?
[41:31.68]Okay, I want... So, we got... Where is... Where the fuck is this person?
[41:43.13]Why do they have, like, a question mark next to them?
[41:48.67]I never understood what that means.
[41:49.77]Alright, who's the tank gonna be?
[41:52.66]Is it gonna be... I mean, yeah.
[41:54.54]Come on.
[41:55.34]Let's do it.
[41:57.93]I need one more ranged or one more damage dealer.
[42:01.13]I don't like this is just straight up this DPS here.
[42:05.11]And I don't like the fact that you have this move equipped.
[42:08.86]That's gonna change real quick.
[42:11.56]I don't have anybody else.
[42:12.40]Do I have to bring this guy?
[42:16.52]I could bring the Yharnamite, you know, that's true.
[42:19.48]Okay.
[42:20.10]Alright, I'm okay with this.
[42:22.04]This team ain't that bad.
[42:26.50]Leper, great pick.
[42:28.48]Leper is always a great pick.
[42:30.81]I refuse to have everybody hate me for this.
[42:34.39]Okay.
[42:37.05]Let me go make sure these guys have decent stuff.
[42:46.02]Okay, what do you got?
[42:49.06]Hmm.
[42:56.75]Off speed.
[42:57.95]Just blind fire.
[43:00.15]Battlefield bandage.
[43:01.27]And the clear mark.
[43:02.53]Clear stun and clear marked.
[43:09.79]The air blast like... The air blast like sucks.
[43:14.91]The mark and the sniper shot are good.
[43:17.47]But I feel like all this other stuff is just so weirdly situational.
[43:22.33]Maybe like this is kind of cool.
[43:25.05]But is it though?
[43:29.46]The air blaster.
[43:33.10]Well, I'm obviously going to do these two.
[43:36.31]I don't know if I want all these.
[43:44.39]I could just get the heal and make it better.
[43:50.22]Flare is good, too.
[43:53.24]I'll get the heal.
[43:53.94]Just for like a support heal.
[43:56.68]We'll go with this.
[43:57.92]And then I'll keep the Bolo.
[44:03.88]Okay.
[44:05.32]What about you?
[44:07.30]You are as leveled up as you can be.
[44:09.48]Although... No.
[44:10.64]Ooh.
[44:13.58]I might be able to do this.
[44:14.50]Hold on.
[44:18.76]Yeah.
[44:20.43]Nothing gives portraits, huh?
[44:22.49]Really?
[44:24.27]Interesting.
[44:25.91]I thought something gave one portrait.
[44:30.36]Hey Japasneeze, thanks for the $15.
[44:31.76]Well, thank you, Japasneeze.
[44:43.20]Appreciate it.
[44:44.64]I'm getting into this game.
[44:47.15]It's very, very, very fun.
[44:49.03]And I left it alone for like a year until I heard about the DLC and then I got interested and then I heard it came on iPad and I played it for like a little while and yes, it's a great game.
[44:56.53]I'm happy to be playing it for sure.
[44:59.62]Uh...
[45:04.25]Let me make sure.
[45:05.63]You're there.
[45:06.43]You're there.
[45:07.59]You're not there.
[45:08.47]I got to get you there.
[45:09.81]You know what I mean?
[45:10.29]Like, if you're coming on a mission like this, I got to get you there, right?
[45:14.09]That's good.
[45:14.59]That's good.
[45:15.29]Who else was the last person?
[45:16.71]You're on a might.
[45:23.29]Your... All your shit.
[45:24.73]I don't even know.
[45:27.18]I'm so confused by this.
[45:28.26]We're just going to go with what we have.
[45:33.82]He has a stress heal, though.
[45:37.60]I definitely don't want this.
[45:40.87]Alright, what do you think?
[45:41.53]Take the stress heal?
[45:43.51]Or... The, uh... Hmm... Maybe I'll get rid of Reign of Sorrows.
[45:58.18]Okay.
[45:58.42]I'm gonna stay out of this.
[46:03.27]Redeem is just a good panic button.
[46:04.53]Yeah, I can see that.
[46:08.18]Alright, I just want to make sure he had, like, points in the stuff that he was using, you know?
[46:11.74]Alright, let's give it a shot.
[46:14.20]Let's go fight the wizened hag.
[46:16.38]Actually, let's take a look at trinkets first, because that's important.
[46:20.19]Uh... Who are the people that... I want to put on the stress tank to give him the stress trinkets for sure.
[46:29.24]Yeah, we're gonna give both of these to the Yharnamite.
[46:32.68]Because, like, fuck it, right?
[46:33.78]We're gonna make him nuts.
[46:37.84]Where did the other one go?
[46:38.68]Left or right?
[46:42.08]So, the Yharnamite's gonna get both of these.
[46:43.62]Okay.
[46:49.20]I'm alright with that.
[46:51.88]Where is he?
[46:52.36]Down here?
[46:55.88]Just make him stress the fuck out and get there quick.
[47:01.83]Oh, you can do... Can you do unequipped ball trinkets?
[47:03.83]Okay, you can.
[47:04.43]Cool.
[47:04.91]Alright, let's just do that then.
[47:09.30]Still gonna do the same thing.
[47:10.32]Alright, what about you?
[47:16.76]Hmm.
[47:18.90]Hmm.
[47:22.95]Put this on.
[47:23.53]More protection.
[47:29.65]He's gonna be in the front lines.
[47:31.09]Maybe he should have his own.
[47:36.47]Plus damage doesn't help the flagellant very much since his damage isn't bleeds.
[47:40.12]That's true, but I want to get him smoke him distress.
[47:45.10]You know, actually, yeah, you're right.
[47:47.36]I'll give this to him.
[47:48.56]Hmm.
[47:55.34]I'm okay with that.
[47:56.12]We'll give this back to, um... Yeah, more damage.
[48:00.57]Just, like, fucking smash people, you know what I mean?
[48:03.93]Quarks?
[48:04.73]Yeah.
[48:06.41]What about you?
[48:10.29]Stun skill chance.
[48:14.48]I don't... Hmm.
[48:18.96]Don't I have, like, range skill shit?
[48:21.40]I swear to God, I thought I did.
[48:23.75]I don't like any of the move stuff.
[48:25.11]No melee.
[48:25.83]Should this person even have any fucking trinkets on?
[48:30.98]I mean, four dodge is kind of cool, but minus one speed sucks.
[48:34.24]Whatever, I'll do it.
[48:38.32]I mean, this is for the airblast, so...
[48:43.07]I have one speed.
[48:44.13]I'm so fucking useless.
[48:45.75]That's okay.
[48:47.46]I won't be moved around at least.
[48:49.38]Cool.
[48:51.06]You're good.
[48:51.86]You're good.
[48:52.30]I guess you're good.
[48:53.78]And what about you?
[48:59.34]Hmm.
[49:02.05]This is crit.
[49:03.21]This is protection speed.
[49:06.29]I feel like a lot of these are just bad.
[49:09.59]That one doesn't have any downsides, so just put it on.
[49:11.87]You can't wear two of these.
[49:20.05]You permanently complain when your dudes get shuffled around.
[49:22.49]Wait, what?
[49:26.11]That's on me.
[49:27.39]Because I'm putting them in the wrong spots.
[49:32.81]That's like getting surprised.
[49:34.02]I'm okay with this.
[49:40.36]I'm okay with him not having... I mean, sure.
[49:43.68]He's the healer.
[49:44.94]Don't want him to die, I guess.
[49:51.62]camping skills too is a whole nother box stress heal stress let's just go for it let's go change your moves you're fine you need to change so you're gonna keep these on that's good your moves are good your moves are good your moves are good or are they
[50:18.91]No, I need a stun.
[50:20.51]I'm terrified.
[50:21.19]I need to bring a stun.
[50:23.05]And your moves are also good.
[50:24.45]Let's make sure you're all in the right spots.
[50:35.54]I don't want that on.
[50:37.52]I had a change of heart.
[50:44.30]Yeah, change of heart.
[50:47.59]Okay.
[50:48.28]Let's get him in the right places.
[50:49.38]You're good.
[50:50.02]You're good.
[50:50.78]You're good.
[50:51.40]And you're not.
[50:51.90]You're all good.
[50:54.80]Let's give it a shot.
[50:55.84]Let's go beat.
[50:56.74]Let's go beat the wizened hag.
[51:01.97]So this is a medium dungeon.
[51:03.49]There's blood here, but it's not important.
[51:11.63]I'm scared.
[51:12.53]So I'm taking like a bunch of stuff.
[51:15.83]I'm taking a lot of stuff because I am scared of this shit.
[51:19.11]I just am.
[51:19.63]I'm not going to lie.
[51:20.49]I'm scared.
[51:24.70]I'm taking a lot of things.
[51:28.62]So much food.
[51:29.57]I know.
[51:35.24]It's alright.
[51:36.22]I just brought a shitload of torches and too much food.
[51:38.74]I had collected many rare and elusive volumes on ancient herbal properties and was set to enjoy several weeks immersed in comfortable study.
[51:48.25]My work was interrupted, however, by a singularly striking young woman who insisted on repeated calls to the house.
[51:56.61]What, she called the house a bunch of times?
[51:59.17]There is method in the wild corruption here.
[52:04.33]It bears a form both wretched and malevolent.
[52:07.49]We know where it is.
[52:08.29]We just have to go through the whole dungeon.
[52:10.57]Alright, let's go.
[52:13.84]Let's go!
[52:18.06]Frank called while I actually kept calling my house.
[52:20.22]It's really irritating.
[52:26.37]She delivered 14 pieces.
[52:29.23]Why though?
[52:29.69]It's alright.
[52:30.07]Good.
[52:30.27]Give him that.
[52:31.39]I guess I shouldn't have had him do that.
[52:35.31]Maybe I should have.
[52:35.95]So he gets stressed out as fast as possible.
[52:37.65]Alright.
[52:42.10]Let's do it.
[52:43.18]What do we got?
[52:52.79]Could buff myself.
[52:53.63]I could just whack this guy.
[52:54.67]I could debuff this guy.
[52:58.43]What do you have for protection?
[53:00.09]Like, nothing.
[53:00.89]No, just whack him.
[53:01.73]That's a lot of fucking damage.
[53:05.01]Holy shit, that trinket is crazy.
[53:06.65]That's a 24 damage to that guy in one swing without a crit.
[53:10.98]Holy hell.
[53:13.12]These guys bleed resistant.
[53:14.22]Let's drop this on back.
[53:24.44]This is a hag run with two melee.
[53:29.24]Ow!
[53:30.93]Is that a problem?
[53:32.39]I don't- This is the first time I've ever played against the hag.
[53:40.36]What is that?
[53:43.76]No, I fucking... Alright, I got a complaint.
[53:47.36]Here's my complaint.
[53:49.36]I wish that they, like... No, no complaining.
[53:52.74]There's no complaint here.
[53:53.60]Never mind.
[53:54.42]I was gonna make a complaint.
[53:56.24]That, like... I wish that moves would stay in the same places.
[53:59.16]Like, instead of move the fuck around all over the place.
[54:01.00]Complaint!
[54:01.34]There it is.
[54:04.29]There's your complaint.
[54:06.85]Like, if you have a move, like, I just wish, like, a chop sometimes could be, like, over here if you reassign it.
[54:11.35]I just would just put it in the same spots.
[54:13.47]What the heck?
[54:14.51]What the heck?
[54:21.62]Kill him.
[54:25.26]I can move them?
[54:25.78]How do I move them?
[54:26.36]How do I do that?
[54:28.28]How do I pick it up?
[54:29.10]Is it, like, shift-click?
[54:37.06]Books, traffic, and moves.
[54:39.64]We're talking about lots of complaints here.
[54:41.48]Books, traffic, and moves.
[54:44.30]Okay.
[54:44.72]Blue, move forward.
[54:46.40]No, that moves him.
[55:00.41]Oh, what is this?
[55:01.91]Eldritch Altar.
[55:02.65]No, I don't... That's alright.
[55:07.61]Tuckered out.
[55:08.70]Removed.
[55:10.22]Okay.
[55:10.78]I'm good with that.
[55:12.96]Keep that on him.
[55:14.98]Keep going.
[55:18.78]Watch out for shit.
[55:20.62]Sometimes a tree is just a tree.
[55:35.25]Equip and unequip the Hamlet to organize.
[55:37.01]Okay.
[55:41.57]Another right in a row.
[55:47.97]At least I surprised him.
[55:49.20]Where's my Plague Doctor?
[55:50.12]I don't like this.
[55:51.38]I want the Plague Doctor.
[55:53.40]Ay-yi-yi.
[55:56.02]These guys bleed resistant?
[55:56.98]No.

[56:31.59]Use the numbers instead of clicking?
[56:34.57]I like to click.
[56:39.32]Is that really that big of a deal to some people?
[56:42.28]Don't click the move.
[56:43.04]Press 1, 2, 3.
[56:43.88]Play League of Legends.
[56:44.80]Q, E, R, T, 1, 2, 4.
[56:47.86]I like to click.
[56:48.44]I'm a clicker.
[56:48.98]I've been a clicker my entire life.
[57:01.13]T?
[57:01.71]Yeah of course, people use T for like teleport!
[57:04.03]T for teleport.
[57:06.73]It's not gonna happen, I'm gonna be clicking all stream.
[57:12.37]T is teleportation.
[57:19.86]Now I'm gonna be thinking about that.
[57:21.54]That guy just got in my head.
[57:23.88]I like to look at him and be like, oh ACC 100, ACC 100, ooh 105.
[57:33.59]That's a lot of stuff.
[57:34.17]Good.
[57:34.97]Good, good, good, good, good.
[57:37.22]No scouting.
[57:38.54]Oh well.
[57:42.70]Sometimes you have to click.
[57:43.60]Did I not click?
[57:45.24]How do you get this without clicking?
[57:46.73]Is this like six?
[57:52.73]Jerma, what the fuck?
[57:53.53]You didn't press like G to loot that body.
[58:00.98]Uh-huh.

[58:30.65]God damn it.
[58:38.07]Minus question mark.
[58:42.15]I don't want to get rid of the shovels.
[58:43.47]Anybody hungry?
[58:46.44]Hey, need a Snickers?
[58:47.82]Why wait?

[59:17.52]Low energy stream.
[59:18.66]I know.
[59:19.04]I did say that.
[59:21.72]I did say that.
[59:22.38]You're right.
[59:22.72]I'm going against my policy.
[59:24.01]You open it.
[59:32.46]Wealth beyond measure.
[59:34.82]Awarded to the brave and the foolhardy alike.
[59:37.22]Definitely traps.
[59:39.74]Thank you.
[59:42.76]Sorry.
[59:43.22]Good.
[59:43.42]That's lucky.
[59:44.70]Easiest enemy in the game.
[59:46.40]Just have to do a hue with the leper and they both die.
[59:51.02]Oh, sorry.
[59:51.38]Hold on.
[59:51.64]3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2.
[59:52.00]Fuck.
[59:56.58]I feel like that made that happen.
[59:58.02]I feel like I fucked around with that too much and the game didn't understand what I was doing.
[60:01.24]And like it broke.
[60:02.44]Whoops-a-daisy.
[60:02.86]I fucked around too much.
[60:12.05]Anything behind here?
[60:15.11]I don't know.
[60:26.01]Should I camp here?
[60:26.99]I don't think so.
[60:28.61]I wonder.
[60:31.23]Nice.
[60:32.69]Secret.
[60:33.03]Do I have keys, right?
[60:34.81]I'm not going to have enough room for any of this shit.
[60:38.83]Well, as long as I know I don't have to go that way.
[60:40.33]Let's see if I can get another secret.
[60:44.92]Shit.
[60:49.30]These journal pages take up so much space.
[60:52.32]Why?
[60:54.14]Get rid of the anti-venom.
[61:02.32]Keep going.
[61:03.32]Where is it?
[61:04.46]Right here, right?
[61:08.08]I'm going to get something so cool and... Oh my god!
[61:14.04]Oh my god!
[61:15.71]Okay, hold on.
[61:20.15]Give him this.
[61:22.17]Jesus Christ.
[61:24.91]Okay, what do I have to do?
[61:25.63]What do I delete here?
[61:26.57]I can't lose.
[61:28.17]This is way too much stuff to lose, by the way.
[61:39.19]That's 3,500 fucking dollars.
[61:40.77]Fuck the journal.
[61:41.59]It's fine.
[61:44.13]Journal pages don't do anything?
[61:45.27]What are you talking about?
[61:45.85]I thought... I thought, um... Hold on.
[61:51.66]Let me make sure I'm very clear about this.
[61:54.42]I thought journal pages were one of the heirlooms.
[62:01.12]That piece of paper in the bottom is not that item.
[62:06.26]Those are lore pages.
[62:10.12]So what the fuck are the pieces of paper at the bottom?
[62:13.80]The deeds are heirlooms.
[62:15.90]Those are lore pages.
[62:18.55]Oh boy, have I been keeping those.
[62:21.61]I've been holding on to those.
[62:24.55]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[62:27.31]Well, look, it's a piece of paper.
[62:29.57]The heirloom is very clearly like a piece of paper that looks just like this.
[62:32.89]Get it out of here.
[62:34.30]Get the hell out of here, please.
[62:36.62]What the fuck?
[62:38.46]Unbelievable.
[62:40.29]I was certain that those were the heirlooms, cause like, look, see, it's like, look!
[62:44.47]Look, listen to me, listen to me.
[62:46.57]At the, the heirloom screen.
[62:49.03]Painting.
[62:49.87]You pick up paintings.
[62:51.13]Painting is an heirloom.
[62:52.83]George Washington bust face.
[62:54.85]It's an heirloom.
[62:55.95]A shield.
[62:56.71]Heirloom.
[62:57.45]Pages!
[62:58.49]Fucking pages!
[62:59.53]Heirloom.
[63:03.55]Anybody can make that mistake, okay?
[63:18.93]Come on pick my quick clicking Jeremy A lot of people do I look you guys act like I have like 40 hours in this game I just downloaded.

[64:04.17]Hey, easy.
[64:06.69]Easy.
[64:07.17]These guys both should die.
[64:10.77]No, they're not gonna die.
[64:13.76]And then I have a boss to... I'm gonna have to, like, abandon... No, I'm not abandoning the boss.

[64:35.19]You guys know that there are, like, 3,000 items on this game's wiki page?
[64:40.52]Can I get like an ounce of slack?
[64:42.80]I just started playing this game like fucking two hours ago.
[64:47.96]Keep the journal pages.
[64:58.07]You need them to progress.
[64:59.13]Don't give me that.
[65:00.69]Don't give me that right now.
[65:03.50]I ain't having that right now.
[65:08.59]Shit.

[65:15.15]That clicked.
[65:15.81]Come on, really?
[65:25.18]He'll die.
[65:28.83]I need more stress on him.
[65:30.75]He's kind of useless right now.
[65:32.07]Come on.
[65:32.85]Stress him out.
[65:39.03]And I got, like, a... Can I just eat these out of the box?
[65:45.23]Okay, I can.
[65:49.31]Uh, drift just blade.
[65:52.27]I can't take this.
[65:53.35]And I, like...

[66:06.46]Hopefully that wasn't a mistake.
[66:15.82]Ditch the jade?
[66:17.00]Ah, but it's like $750.
[66:17.62]Jade sucks.
[66:18.16]It's $375.
[66:30.70]What is this?
[66:31.20]Is this somebody's, like, fucking fossilized nutsack?
[66:34.76]Like, why is this 375?
[66:36.24]I thought it was, like, 3700.
[66:36.80]Kidding.
[66:38.79]I didn't think.
[66:39.19]I didn't think that.
[66:40.07]Don't.
[66:40.37]Please.
[66:43.21]Alright.
[66:50.90]I'm gonna replace the ruby with the jade.
[66:54.38]Does that make you guys happy?
[66:57.30]Is everybody going to be happy about this?
[66:59.16]I hope so.
[67:00.46]Look, I didn't expect I was going to get two Minecraft obsidians, okay?
[67:04.80]I didn't think that was going to happen.
[67:07.27]I planned for disaster.
[67:08.57]I mean, no.
[67:12.25]Wrong.
[67:12.85]Wrong.
[67:13.23]No.
[67:13.75]How is it... Ruby's dumb.
[67:15.79]It's $12.50.
[67:16.43]It's the most expensive thing I have.
[67:22.32]It's the most expensive... Look, should I get rid of the fucking pea soup?
[67:28.73]Alright, look, I ate a pea soup.
[67:30.41]Should I get rid of the pea soup?
[67:31.27]I just dropped it.
[67:43.48]Remove the camp.
[67:44.22]No, I'm going to camp before I fight the hag.
[67:47.18]We're camping in this room.
[67:53.95]We're camping in this room.
[67:55.31]Because it's the room right before the hag.
[67:58.34]I'm going to give all the buffs.
[67:59.36]I'm going to get all the secrets.
[68:05.80]Fuck.
[68:08.05]Somebody just said to get rid of the onyx with this.
[68:10.69]But not yet.
[68:11.63]I might.
[68:11.97]I might do that soon.
[68:18.99]Okay.
[68:20.29]Alright, here we go.
[68:20.97]We're camping in this room.
[68:22.57]There's the hag.
[68:24.47]Camp.
[68:27.49]What do we got?
[68:28.21]I got a bunch of food.
[68:29.27]Just eat it all.
[68:30.17]Just fucking, just mow it down.
[68:38.63]That's fine.
[68:39.21]Okay, whatever.
[68:40.27]Now what can you do?
[68:40.93]You have any diseases?
[68:43.61]No.
[68:45.28]He's turning his back.
[68:47.18]Plus 40%.
[68:48.98]Let's do that.
[68:49.56]That's what I'm doing.
[68:50.52]Bingo.
[68:53.54]Suffer.
[68:56.98]Minus 20 stress, 10 AC, 5 crit.
[68:59.41]Okay.
[69:01.89]Um... Maybe I should do this.
[69:05.27]I'm doing this.
[69:06.25]I don't know what the hag does.
[69:07.93]I'm gonna assume she's, like, a magician, so probably, like, blight and, like, debuff and shit, right?
[69:14.58]That's what I'm gonna say.
[69:21.35]Life is pain.
[69:22.97]She's probably a magician.
[69:25.71]Oh, we're doing that.
[69:27.53]What do you got?
[69:27.99]Remove bleeding.
[69:30.97]Self only.
[69:31.57]Plus 10.
[69:32.05]Plus 20% damage.
[69:33.85]Minus 2 speed.
[69:34.69]Her speed is already trash.
[69:36.66]Should I do this and just take off the... Take one of these off?
[69:40.50]That's a lot.
[69:41.22]That's really good.
[69:42.12]But I'm gonna be useless.
[69:47.02]Alright, should I do this and then take off these trinkets?
[70:01.75]Check the wiki before the fight.
[70:03.19]I'm doing it.
[70:07.41]Oh, watch this.
[70:08.89]Watch this.
[70:10.17]Okay, for a second, I thought you just turned into, like, a tortilla soup.
[70:13.47]I, like, thought... Okay, that was... I glanced over, and I saw, like, the big soup there, and I was like, wait, I turned into a soup.
[70:19.20]Okay.
[70:19.34]What do we got here?
[70:25.48]This is just stress heals.
[70:31.29]Anybody have a disease?
[70:32.23]I know it's self only.
[70:35.09]We'll do this too.
[70:36.65]Because other than that, like, yeah, we're just going to do this.
[70:42.48]I think I'm good to go.
[70:43.84]Anybody else have anything to, like, last second here?
[70:47.82]Minus 25 stress, minus 15.
[70:49.52]I mean, like, no.
[70:51.56]I guess I could do this to him.
[70:52.94]Just to get him to zero.
[70:53.90]Yeah, we can just get one guy to zero.
[70:59.18]I'm ready.
[70:59.98]I'm ready for the hag.
[71:02.98]We're healthy and mentally steeled for the challenge.
[71:05.44]We've used our last log, so what's the state of things?
[71:07.48]Our provisions run low.
[71:08.46]The journey best not last much longer.
[71:10.17]Full blast light.
[71:12.25]Let's go.
[71:13.45]Let's go, you hag.
[71:20.74]Fuck you.
[71:21.70]Disarm it.
[71:22.52]Disarm it.
[71:23.36]An unburnt torch.
[71:29.07]Get it to full blast.
[71:29.85]Here comes the hack.
[71:30.55]I'm ready.
[71:31.11]I'm ready.
[71:33.17]Beat her.
[71:37.01]There she is.
[71:37.47]Okay, here we go.
[71:37.95]Let me look at her first.
[71:38.71]Okay, she has 100% stun resistance.
[71:40.95]20% bleed resistance.
[71:41.37]40% debuffer.
[71:41.59]Okay, move.
[71:48.76]Because she's going to cauldron.
[71:49.76]What the hell is this?
[71:51.44]This has 200% of everything.
[71:54.36]So, like, I can't... Can I even hurt this?
[71:57.50]What does she do to that?
[71:58.11]Okay, so... She has 66 health.
[72:02.31]She, like, really... She kind of can't be stunned.
[72:05.15]What does she do for damage?
[72:05.95]I don't know.
[72:07.25]I'm scared.
[72:07.65]Just do this.
[72:08.35]Just debuff her with, like... Do a damage debuff.
[72:11.15]Oh, shit.
[72:17.39]Should I...
[72:21.57]Debuff the target.
[72:22.69]Okay, I'm gonna... What does she got for protections?
[72:24.39]Anything?
[72:26.35]Drop her damn... I'm just gonna drop her fucking damage.
[72:29.71]I'm scared.
[72:32.61]Because I don't... I'm like... I don't know what happens if I hit this.
[72:40.53]She's... Bleed is good.
[72:43.87]So I'm gonna drop the bleed on her.
[72:47.43]Spill the soup.
[72:49.70]Oh god, here she goes.
[72:51.37]Into the pot.
[72:54.83]Oh gosh, he throws somebody in the pot.
[72:56.15]What do I do?
[72:56.41]Do I have to heal them?
[73:02.09]I don't know.
[73:03.19]I think I have to heal them while they're in the pot.
[73:04.39]This is just like that World of Warcraft raid.
[73:06.92]I'm going to ace this.
[73:08.44]I've played this in World of Warcraft.
[73:13.10]Can I not see his health?
[73:16.88]I can't stun him.
[73:18.36]I can't heal him either.
[73:19.12]He's just in there.
[73:22.36]I'm gonna have to go for a stun because she's already debuffed.
[73:27.94]Get it.
[73:32.47]I can't even reach over there.
[73:33.87]Should I hit the pot?
[73:36.81]Oh, shit.
[73:37.29]I spilled him out.
[73:38.55]Okay, we're good.
[73:40.25]Why does he have no stress?
[73:41.15]No, there we go.
[73:41.87]No, he's just putting him back in.
[73:42.87]No, don't put him back in.
[73:45.20]Alright, so the leper is the designated pot spiller.
[73:47.14]I get it.
[73:50.38]Oh, baby!
[73:53.91]Baby.
[73:56.79]This boss is fucking easy.
[73:59.75]What am I so scared about?
[74:01.01]Am I actually scared about this?
[74:09.09]I'm gonna kill her right now.
[74:10.83]She's gonna get shot.
[74:11.49]Everybody thought I was gonna be like an instant wipe here.
[74:20.42]I need a healer.
[74:21.08]Don't worry, I got my designated pot tipper.
[74:25.17]Oh, fuck, he almost died.
[74:27.75]Neat tenderizing.
[74:31.56]Bingo.
[74:33.20]Oh, oh, that's not... That's not a bingo.
[74:36.50]But this is.
[74:38.92]Don't bleed to death here.
[74:42.08]Oh, come on.
[74:45.13]That should have been the ending blow there.
[74:46.59]Uh-oh.
[74:46.95]Don't, like... That's fine.
[74:49.11]I don't care.
[74:49.53]Okay.
[74:53.98]Just tip that fucking pod over, leper.
[74:59.36]And... There it is.
[75:04.18]Somebody said this game was hard?
[75:11.59]I'm just kidding.
[75:12.63]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[75:14.09]Mm-hmm.
[75:18.84]+2 speed.
[75:20.72]This stuff is kind of terrible.
[75:25.06]Use the medicinal healing and whatever.
[75:28.84]Is there like a box in here or anything?
[75:32.93]Not even trying.
[75:34.15]Okay, I'm going to be fair though.
[75:37.49]I do have some of these stupid trinkets that I found, right?
[75:42.89]I found like a handful of stupid trinkets.
[75:48.07]But that's good.
[75:48.93]Hag down.
[75:54.65]Plague doctor only.
[75:57.50]That's really good.
[76:02.02]Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
[76:04.20]Yeah.
[76:10.56]Got plenty of journals.
[76:14.45]Alright, wait a minute.
[76:16.17]Wait a minute.
[76:18.27]So, let me ask you guys this question then.
[76:22.63]If... I have to pick these up, and they have to be in my inventory.
[76:27.03]I pick these up, I pick up the portraits, I pick up the busts.
[76:34.07]Where are these from?
[76:35.55]These weren't in my inventory.
[76:36.49]Where are they from?
[76:37.13]Are those the journal pages?
[76:39.17]That I don't understand.
[76:39.93]Like, I didn't pick these up.
[76:40.75]Where are they from?
[76:47.48]These stack.
[76:48.34]These are in the... Are these in the inventory?
[76:51.54]They were?
[76:51.96]As what?
[76:53.24]What do they look like?
[77:00.22]They were in my... Look, Mr. Deeds isn't even a good movie.
[77:02.61]That's why Adam Sandler, like, started to fail.
[77:05.67]That whole movie was a Wendy's ad.
[77:07.55]Okay?
[77:08.49]I don't think... Mr. Deeds was... That was a fucking Wendy's advertisement.
[77:12.31]The whole movie.
[77:15.94]And then that kid grew up and split into two people and got a show about living on a boat.
[77:22.36]I don't know how it works.
[77:23.00]Hollywood doesn't make any sense to me.
[77:28.86]That's fine.
[77:29.38]That's fine.
[77:29.88]That's fine.
[77:30.44]Okay.
[77:35.42]Apparently a lot of people didn't get that joke.
[77:45.87]I'm not even going to explain it.
[77:47.97]Those of you that got it, you got it.
[77:49.09]There you go.
[77:50.11]I don't even need to explain.
[77:51.61]We're good.
[77:53.01]But I do have enough people at level 3 now to do level 3 dungeons, I believe.
[77:59.49]Although, let's see here.
[78:00.41]Sort by level.
[78:03.27]I hate that.
[78:03.82]Come on.
[78:05.62]Let me sort it.
[78:11.18]Get out of here.
[78:11.78]Get out.
[78:15.63]What do I got?
[78:16.91]Okay, I do have a full party of level threes.
[78:20.86]So I can do a veteran mission with these guys.
[78:23.24]And I gotta be careful.
[78:25.34]Because these guys are very, very high.
[78:27.76]Look, I understand.
[78:29.58]Head to the courtyard.
[78:34.15]I can't bring these guys to the courtyard, can I?
[78:35.51]No.
[78:38.13]Dream team.
[78:40.87]Western Pennsylvania is the most God-fearing...
[78:44.98]I like this team a lot, though.
[78:48.17]And why is the leper never stressed out?
[78:51.69]Ever.
[78:52.63]After every mission.
[78:55.55]What do you got for disease?
[78:57.09]Is anything bad?
[79:00.69]Okay, let me go pee.
[79:01.35]I'll be right back.
[79:04.14]Send them into the Darkest Dungeon.
[79:05.84]Absolutely not.
[79:07.42]I'll be right back.
[79:07.86]Let me just take a piss.
[81:15.31]Anybody else have this problem?
[81:18.83]Where... So I have... I'm wearing a pair of shorts right now.
[81:22.11]They're just kind of gym clothes, gym shorts, whatever.
[81:25.19]And I've owned these pants.
[81:26.97]I don't know why.
[81:27.81]I have no single... I can't tell you why.
[81:31.04]I've owned them for about...
[81:34.49]17 years.
[81:35.55]They're just basketball shorts.
[81:37.05]That's all they are.
[81:38.33]They're like four sizes too big for me.
[81:41.25]They were like a hand-me-down from my brother.
[81:44.39]I still have them.
[81:46.99]Why?
[81:47.21]Like, why do I have these?
[81:51.77]I need to get rid of these.
[81:53.03]That they still kind of fit me.
[81:55.09]They were like a hand-me-down from my brother 17 years ago.
[81:58.69]And, like, I wear them just to, like, schlep.
[82:00.77]Just, like, go around the house.
[82:01.95]You know what I mean?
[82:04.12]They're comfy, they're very easy to wear, but like, they're huge on me.
[82:07.01]And I have to tie the string really tight.
[82:09.67]Otherwise they'll fall down.
[82:11.17]It's like wearing dad's clothes.
[82:16.49]Why do I still have these?
[82:18.03]And it's like, what brand is this?
[82:21.68]This is Abercrombie.
[82:24.88]I haven't been inside of an Abercrombie store since I was probably 16.
[82:29.68]And you're talking about like fucking 16 years ago.
[82:34.76]These shorts are as old as it has been since I've been in the store.
[82:40.32]What?
[82:40.76]No, that... Okay, yeah, that makes... That's just me explaining that I've had them for 16 years in a really roundabout way.
[82:46.14]Forget about that.
[82:47.30]What's important is why do I do this?
[82:48.84]Why do I have this stuff?
[82:53.26]Alright, let's do a long mission.
[82:55.06]Let's do like a veteran mission.
[83:00.44]I'm up 32. 32.
[83:06.27]What is it?
[83:08.93]Oh, you guys can like hear this.
[83:11.83]Okay, is it like, what does it sound like I'm getting like beat up over here?
[83:21.99]Okay, I fucking died.
[83:29.80]That was fucking funny.
[83:33.00]Shut up, shut up, it was funny.
[83:34.68]If you were four years old, you would have laughed at that.
[83:36.64]If that was on Nickelodeon, if that was on Nickelodeon, you guys would have all laughed.
[83:47.10]That shit, you know what I'm telling you, that shit on Nick Jr., that's a fucking joke on Nick Jr.
[83:51.49]It's like wrong profession.
[83:54.09]I should be like a writer on, I should be a writer on like, Roly Poly Oly.
[83:59.49]What's that show, Oly Poly Roly?
[84:00.93]What's the show?
[84:02.79]Alright, let's go.
[84:05.68]This is my dream team.
[84:11.92]Let me look at the... Let's take a look.
[84:14.82]Okay, we got the vial now.
[84:17.94]Let's unequip the trinkets.
[84:21.57]Alright, this is good.
[84:23.47]Plus 15% more chance to hit ranged.
[84:26.97]More stun and more... Like, this just makes him so good.
[84:30.81]I hope he never dies.
[84:33.82]Do the Bills joke with buff shamans again.
[84:38.13]You laughed at that.
[84:39.89]The guy that just said that, you laughed at that last time.
[84:42.17]I'm serious.
[84:45.25]Okay, healing skills.
[84:46.23]Obviously this is going back to him.
[84:51.74]Max damage, yeah.
[84:55.49]I like this combo, because then you don't get any of this.
[84:58.51]It just negates each other.
[84:59.97]The Deathblow Resistance, that's fine.
[85:01.55]He ain't gonna die.
[85:02.41]I'm okay with that.
[85:03.97]I don't have any Bounty Hunters, but that's really fucking good.
[85:07.69]Okay.
[85:09.36]What else do you want?
[85:12.62]One of these.
[85:13.14]This is fine.
[85:15.58]Oh, you know, I could give him the Speed Cloak.
[85:17.76]I think I like that better.
[85:19.24]I do.
[85:21.50]He's not gonna die.
[85:22.02]This guy's gonna live the entire time I play the game.
[85:28.74]Uh, ACC is, is prime on the, um... Yeah, because doesn't he have, like, a... By default, his moves are, like, what, like a 70, 75% chance to hit?
[85:36.94]He doesn't, like, have, like, a guaranteed hit?
[85:39.37]That's alright.
[85:39.85]This is fine for now.
[85:41.13]Uh, let's do that.
[85:41.77]Uh, where's this one?
[85:45.03]Highwayman, that's fine.
[85:46.25]Because he does the, uh, counterattack anyways.
[85:51.33]I don't use the ranged that often.
[85:54.66]Mmm...
[86:05.21]Plus 2% crit.
[86:08.21]Gives me about 10%, 9% crit.
[86:14.45]More stress and a little bit less virtue chance, but who cares about that?
[86:17.21]No one's going to even get that close anyways.
[86:18.75]I'll do 2% crit.
[86:19.87]Who cares?
[86:21.71]Plague Doctor already has this on.
[86:22.95]It's really good.
[86:25.26]That's really good too.
[86:30.72]Somebody needs to put this on.
[86:34.32]Maybe they don't.
[86:37.26]Maybe they don't.
[86:40.29]That's mediocre?
[86:41.33]What?
[86:42.51]Yeah, but, like, who cares?
[86:43.29]It's not that... No one's gonna die.
[86:47.63]Um... Be careful about... Delete me!
[86:55.72]Why would I delete you?
[86:56.54]You're, like, the best character I have.
[86:58.98]No, you're not.
[86:59.74]You're like a middle-of-the-road character.
[87:00.98]You're fine.
[87:01.30]I don't know.
[87:01.70]I need another tank.
[87:03.66]Just because this guy won't get stressed out.
[87:05.15]I'm gonna go with that.
[87:17.32]It's okay.
[87:18.36]I have a lot of stress management issues here, though.
[87:24.56]I don't want to lose speed.
[87:25.56]We'll just go with this.
[87:26.34]That's fine.
[87:28.00]That means it's almost guaranteed for my shit to hit.
[87:30.88]Talking about 15, like 25 extra chance.
[87:34.70]That's fine.
[87:35.12]Let's go.
[87:35.42]Are they in the right spots?
[87:36.76]Are you guys in the right spots?
[87:42.31]That's good.
[87:44.59]to dive.
[87:46.73]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[87:47.59]Point blank is good.
[87:48.97]Grape shot's good.
[87:50.93]Stun, right?
[87:51.65]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[87:53.31]Wait.
[87:54.76]Yep.
[87:55.76]Yep.
[87:56.72]Let's go.
[87:56.96]I'm gonna do this one.
[87:59.76]This one's short.
[88:00.28]Veteran level three.
[88:01.14]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[88:01.64]Just to complete the room battles.
[88:02.82]We got it.
[88:10.90]Just got the game because of your stream and I died in the fucking prologue.
[88:14.10]Well, sorry to hear that.
[88:23.69]You'll learn though.
[88:24.41]You'll learn.
[88:31.01]Here we go.
[88:32.19]This is short, right?
[88:34.35]It's not my birthday today.
[88:35.85]Why is everybody saying it's my birthday?
[88:39.01]I'm okay with this.
[88:39.59]This is short.
[88:40.11]There's only gonna be, like, eight or nine rooms.
[88:41.41]I'll be okay.
[88:42.85]There's no camping in this.
[88:44.53]Maybe one more torch, just to make sure I'm, like, not scared.
[88:47.35]And, like, two more food.
[88:48.65]Okay.
[88:51.43]And... Wait a minute.
[88:52.65]Excuse me.
[88:54.06]Ex... Hold on.
[88:55.88]Excuse me.
[88:59.61]I have enough to do this, don't I?
[89:02.45]I do.
[89:02.71]Okay.
[89:05.17]Excuse me.
[89:08.91]So this goes from dodge base 15, HP base, dodge base, HP base.
[89:12.74]Okay.
[89:13.34]That's a big deal.
[89:18.72]Like, this is the dream team.
[89:20.04]It just is.
[89:23.58]I'm happy with this.
[89:29.72]Happy birthday.
[89:35.01]I'm not, my birthday is not right now.
[89:37.45]My birthday's coming up real soon though.
[89:39.25]Holy shit, it really is.
[89:40.35]I did not see that coming.
[89:43.35]Wait, can I afford this too?
[89:48.13]Not yet.
[89:51.89]I can't afford it yet.
[89:55.12]Next time.
[89:56.16]Next time I will.
[89:57.30]Let's go.
[90:00.70]This is fine.
[90:01.18]Veteran.
[90:01.64]Short.
[90:01.96]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[90:03.16]Complete the battles.
[90:03.94]Provisions.
[90:04.66]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[90:08.49]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[90:09.83]Torches is fine.
[90:12.25]Peace soup.
[90:13.21]One key.
[90:14.49]And a shovel.
[90:15.63]Get out of town.
[90:19.28]The dream meme team takes on the Darkest Dungeon.
[90:25.70]Over the hill?
[90:27.51]They breed quickly down there in the dark.
[90:30.73]But perhaps we can slay them even faster.
[90:33.51]Oh, Gerber, don't take a shovel.
[90:34.67]Don't take the shovel.
[90:35.51]What are you thinking?
[90:37.11]First room had something I needed to take the shovel with.
[90:38.94]And this, we put some medicine on this.
[90:48.54]Is this where this goes?
[90:51.31]I think this is where this goes, right?
[90:52.43]I'm going to hold it here.
[91:13.18]I ain't touching it.
[91:14.64]I'm gonna listen to you guys.
[91:16.30]Oh my god, what the fuck are these things?
[91:19.99]What the fuck?
[91:22.55]This is just, this is the witch from Left 4 Dead.
[91:25.71]Except on steroids.
[91:27.41]Years later.
[91:28.65]Okay, and this is, that's an HP Lovecraft inspired monster!
[91:38.26]We're gonna okay obviously we're gonna do duelists advanced here, but what the fuck Stun blight the blight resistance.
[91:44.80]Well.
[91:44.96]They have a lot of resistances, so I Can't do okay.
[91:49.14]I can't do anything to this guy besides like attack it so go front row first We got what about damage I?
[91:59.44]Feel like I'm scared of the guy back here, so I
[92:06.16]Blight can go on this one.
[92:07.90]Not on that guy.
[92:08.66]Can I reach?
[92:09.32]No, but at least I can throw a grenade.
[92:12.24]Come on.
[92:12.76]Nice.
[92:13.66]And I have a lot more chance to hit that, so that's good.
[92:16.16]Howl.
[92:19.73]Horror.
[92:21.39]Three stress per round.
[92:28.65]I'm going for it.
[92:31.89]Next round is going to be like a shit show.
[92:33.45]I'm going to drop an anchor on this person's head.
[92:40.33]Go, keep it up, do another grenade.
[92:43.23]Another grenade, or should I buff hip?
[92:47.77]We're going to kill this guy in one hit.
[92:53.49]Watch this one.
[92:54.83]Let's kill this guy in one fucking swing.
[93:02.77]Here it is.
[93:03.85]Bingo.
[93:04.55]Chop.
[93:06.75]20.
[93:08.01]See ya.
[93:08.71]Not even a crit either.
[93:11.53]Skull toss.
[93:12.47]Dodged it.
[93:16.27]Mmm.
[93:20.37]Let's go one more round on that, I guess.
[93:22.21]Nobody needs healing or anything.
[93:23.23]Just try to hit him.
[93:27.23]What is he doing?
[93:29.41]What the hell was that?
[93:35.89]Uh, I can't do anything.
[93:40.71]What a superstar.
[93:45.75]Ow.
[93:47.79]It's alright, I resisted that.
[93:51.37]Mmm, yep.
[93:55.11]The chance to hit that is, so that's 40%, so that's an extra, so he really has like, what, like a 20% chance to, uh, poison him by that?
[94:03.14]That's good.
[94:07.54]Point blank.
[94:08.00]Should kill him.
[94:09.44]Aye.
[94:12.79]Aye.
[94:15.29]Uh, he will die now.
[94:17.79]One swing.
[94:24.29]The horror.
[94:25.87]The horror.
[94:29.58]Stop clicking again.
[94:31.28]Twelve crests.
[94:33.22]Three deeds.
[94:33.76]There they are.
[94:34.24]Now I know what they look like.
[94:35.18]They're not dripping pages.
[94:37.88]That was a lot of stuff.
[94:38.86]I don't have any bandages.
[94:40.78]Uh, what's in this room?
[94:48.33]Oh god.
[94:49.71]Okay.
[94:50.67]Pigs gotta die.
[94:51.35]They're all blight resistant though.
[94:53.99]Plague doctor might not have been the greatest thing to do here.
[94:56.60]But you in the back, you gotta... Both of you guys gotta die.
[94:59.88]I don't know who first though.
[95:01.78]Probably you.
[95:08.95]That was gonna crit and kill him.
[95:09.95]That'd be great.
[95:12.93]Oh, crit and kill him.
[95:14.64]Crit and kill him.
[95:18.54]Ah!
[95:19.16]Pig skipped leg day.
[95:22.36]Because they're pretty resistant to Blight, I'm gonna go with a buff on the Leopard.
[95:28.00]And he's gonna go for a double-handed Hue Swing.
[95:32.85]We're gonna debuff this guy.
[95:34.41]Who does more damage?
[95:35.59]You do.
[95:40.58]Nah, I actually probably could've killed him.
[95:41.76]Sorry.
[95:44.24]We're gonna double Q here and we'll kill everybody in the front row.
[95:47.56]Check it.
[95:49.16]He's clicking still, I know.
[95:50.46]It's a habit I'm never gonna get rid of.
[95:58.05]I could've fucked up that back row already.
[95:59.49]What a mistake.
[96:02.87]Ah, well he can't do anything so might as well just do this and go back in line.
[96:05.41]This is what I was trying to avoid.
[96:13.44]It's alright.
[96:14.88]20 fucking damage.
[96:19.68]Kill him in the back row.
[96:22.45]Don't ever stop clicking.
[96:24.57]I had a stun on the plague doctor.
[96:26.95]Don't ask me why.
[96:29.43]Hmm.
[96:36.63]He's too close.
[96:39.53]He's gonna resist this.
[96:41.23]Uh, it don't matter.
[96:41.89]Maybe I'll get lucky.
[96:45.07]No.
[96:47.03]I kind of want to heal.
[96:48.71]But... I gotta use the steering wheel.
[96:53.84]Don't pick up the emeralds, Gemma!
[96:56.78]No, I mean, what was the other ones?
[96:59.02]Don't pick up... What was the thing you guys were yelling at me for?
[97:00.96]This thing.
[97:01.48]Like the tonsil stone.
[97:03.92]Don't pick up the tonsil stone!
[97:12.50]It was Jade.
[97:13.84]I know, I'm just kidding around.
[97:20.26]Tonsil stones suck ass.
[97:21.38]You know, here I got a funny story for you about tonsil stones.
[97:25.14]I had one that was really bad one time and I didn't even know what they were.
[97:29.17]I just had like an irritation in the back of my throat and like a sore throat for like fucking like a month.
[97:35.09]And I had no idea what was wrong with me.
[97:37.68]Turns out, this is a disgusting story, by the way, so I'm gonna refrain from giving you details.
[97:43.34]Disgusting.
[97:46.04]Don't look it up.
[97:49.33]Do not look up what a tonsil stone is.
[97:51.31]Don't.
[97:52.55]It's disgusting.
[97:54.71]The point is, I had a bad in one of my tonsil cavities.
[98:00.41]It was awful.
[98:04.25]That's the story.
[98:04.77]That could have gotten really bad.
[98:07.89]That could have gotten disgusting real quick.
[98:13.95]Why have I not seen any scouts?
[98:15.83]Come on, scout this shit out, guys.
[98:18.91]What am I looking at here?
[98:20.15]It's like a deposit of calcium that gets stuck in your tonsil crypt.
[98:26.52]Yes.
[98:27.62]I never got my tonsils removed.
[98:29.96]So, I... Yep, I know.
[98:32.70]Look.
[98:33.10]Okay, let me... Okay, look, look, look, look.
[98:34.86]Let me show you guys why I thought this was the correct item.
[98:38.64]This was a deed.
[98:39.46]This was one of the heirlooms.
[98:40.72]Let me show you this.
[98:41.64]So, I thought... Take a look at this.
[98:45.87]Kind of looks like it could be together, couldn't it?
[98:47.83]Like, I thought that this... I thought you needed to collect two of them to have the deed be one deed.
[98:55.96]One heirloom.
[98:56.56]Like, look at that.
[98:58.26]They couldn't have made it like that.
[98:59.86]That's the same thing.
[99:00.70]It's just bleeding.
[99:08.80]Let's read it.
[99:10.59]Too much reading.
[99:14.35]Excuses.
[99:15.19]No, it's not an excuse.
[99:16.55]It's scribbled text on the left side of a piece of paper.
[99:20.29]And the other one is scribbled text on the right side of a piece of paper.
[99:25.24]Any scientist could make that mistake.
[99:32.67]Like, you know there's 3,000 Wikipedia entries in this game?
[99:35.31]Fucking god damn it.
[99:36.87]It's just... Ayayay, alright, let's go.
[99:46.29]I'm a scientist.
[99:49.28]Uh, we have to explore every... I can't get any scouts.
[99:52.34]No scouting allowed, apparently.
[99:55.42]This is like reaching into the fountain and taking out a handful of pennies.
[100:02.94]Like, I don't want this.
[100:03.62]Mm-hmm.
[100:19.62]Sorry, this guy has a lot more bark than bite.
[100:22.38]You guys have blight?
[100:22.96]Of course you do.
[100:24.28]I'm not gonna hit either one of these guys.
[100:25.92]So we're gonna buff... I'm gonna buff the highwayman.
[100:32.55]I feel like the counter-attack is gonna be good here.
[100:39.61]Shit!
[100:40.13]Is that gonna... It's okay.
[100:46.85]Munch.
[100:52.25]I could have stunned.
[100:52.87]Yeah, I mean, I could have stunned, but I want him to do a bunch of damage.
[100:54.75]Look at how much fucking damage this guy's doing.
[100:59.55]Seriously.
[100:59.95]What's that do, though?
[101:09.42]40% damage, three rounds.
[101:10.58]That's not good.
[101:11.30]Point blank.
[101:11.90]Shoot him right in the fuck... I clicked it, I know, but it's alright.
[101:14.36]That's 16 damage.
[101:22.64]It's going to heal.
[101:23.56]Curing Blight.
[101:24.30]Your hero is... I knew that.
[101:30.93]Alright.
[101:31.31]Okay, sure.
[101:31.79]Hey, cool.
[101:34.97]Apparently I didn't know that.
[101:40.07]It's only taken like six and a half, seven hours of game time for that to be a thing.
[101:44.85]Who am I going to stun?
[101:45.99]I can't stun the guy in the front.
[101:51.07]Stun one of the guys in the back.
[101:57.66]Crackle.
[101:58.12]W, A, S, D to move you.
[102:01.33]Now can I do... No, I can't reach.
[102:03.05]Hmm.
[102:14.73]Exactly what I want.
[102:17.13]And then throw the tentacles down and... Complete.
[102:26.53]Mmm, don't have to waste any of this.
[102:30.58]But I do have a key.
[102:31.66]It's an unlocked... Ah, I didn't even... Oh well.
[102:35.40]It's trapped anyway, so who gives a shit, right?
[102:38.38]Anything else to look at?
[102:39.62]I did get a scout.
[102:41.08]Mmm.
[102:45.52]No, get him out of here.
[102:46.36]Keep him at low stress.
[102:47.22]I can take these guys again.
[102:48.04]These guys can go right now again.
[102:53.04]Go, go, go, go, go.
[103:06.09]Zero balls.
[103:10.47]Nobody, anybody gets a four or no?
[103:12.81]Let's just, I'm going to take these guys.
[103:14.03]I'll get the fits.
[103:16.79]Plus 3 speed!
[103:19.77]Minus 5% crit.
[103:20.83]That sucks though.
[103:23.33]Holy shit.
[103:24.01]I don't know if I can bring these guys again.
[103:25.77]Let's see.
[103:29.43]100% food consumed if stress is above 50.
[103:30.85]Minus 75% bleed resist and minus 10% mag- Holy shit.
[103:34.03]Oh my god!
[103:34.33]Why?
[103:42.35]Okay, we can't take these guys.
[103:43.73]These guys have to get cured of diseases and shit.
[103:46.29]This is ridiculous.
[103:47.09]Plus 10% max HP.
[103:50.23]Nice.
[103:54.54]Isn't allowed to gamble while in town.
[103:55.82]That's fine.
[103:56.42]Slugger.
[103:57.06]That's useless.
[103:59.96]The Black Plague and the Red Plague.
[104:01.74]So these guys can't do anything else.
[104:04.15]I gotta get rid of those.
[104:04.91]Those are terrible.
[104:06.79]Is this my first time playing?
[104:09.21]Yes.
[104:11.69]Well, uh... It's, like, my first, like, ten hours.
[104:17.23]I guess.
[104:17.53]I'm not sure how you determine, like, what's, like, a new player.
[104:21.38]I mean, I am a new player, but... Let's go to the... Let's go to the Santa... The Sanitarium.
[104:29.18]At two...
[104:31.59]Treatment cost, number of treatment and reward slots.
[104:34.91]No, I need another one.
[104:35.89]Patient cells.
[104:42.55]So, this is medical devices.
[104:44.13]Can I get there?
[104:49.26]Hmm.
[104:57.55]So this is going to be two, three, three.
[105:01.49]So I don't have enough.
[105:03.47]I wouldn't have enough anyways, but that's okay.
[105:10.87]What do you got?
[105:11.39]The red plague.
[105:12.73]Yeah, this is just awful.
[105:14.21]This has to go.
[105:14.87]And what was the other one?
[105:17.40]The black plague?
[105:18.48]This one, yeah.
[105:19.10]This one also has to go.
[105:24.10]Yeah, that's terrible.
[105:25.08]Minus 75% disease resistant.
[105:27.46]How many diseases can you get?
[105:28.52]How's Bird Jerma doing?
[105:32.24]Known cheat.
[105:33.00]Shocker.
[105:37.24]More stress in the cove.
[105:39.52]Isn't allowed to gamble in town.
[105:40.76]Whatever.
[105:42.42]What about you?
[105:45.26]Dodd hitter.
[105:47.57]Well, this is bad.
[105:48.17]This is minus 6% crit.
[105:51.24]If I get down to less than 50%.
[105:52.28]How much is that resolution until I'll never drink?
[105:55.36]That's not that bad.
[105:56.22]Eh.
[105:58.98]Cove-phobe.
[106:04.10]Let's take the lower levels on something.
[106:05.48]I want another guy.
[106:08.72]Should we do a dickhead run?
[106:12.52]No.
[106:12.78]I need to upgrade this.
[106:13.66]We need more people here.
[106:16.79]apparently not hold on number of available heroes to four I want to get this because I want like I want a grave uh a bounty hunter I wanted a hound master I want like I want it all so let's get it number available heroes we'll come back after this and hopefully we get something new I'm gonna sell some of this crap because that's what it is it's crap

[106:52.76]Okay, so
[107:14.42]Judging I told you I'm selling some of this crap crap Get out of here This is kind of good Bad ending
[107:40.70]Mmm, if I get another... Flagellant, I can use that.
[107:46.10]This one's dumb.
[107:47.24]Just, like, fuck off.
[107:48.27]Dodge Stone.
[107:48.89]Give me seven.
[107:49.35]I'd rather take $750,000 than that.
[107:51.13]Okay, so... We got you.
[107:58.44]Unequipped trinkets, please.
[107:59.76]Thank you.
[108:00.06]20% protection.
[108:01.96]And...
[108:07.81]25% damage.
[108:08.39]I could do this too, but I don't want all that stress.
[108:10.41]That's fine.
[108:11.25]He'll just take the protection.
[108:13.23]You are coming on a mission.
[108:14.66]So are you.
[108:25.62]Yeah, take this.
[108:28.68]This lady will do a ton of damage with that on.
[108:32.98]Max HP.
[108:33.74]I lose max.
[108:34.46]I could counterattack that, but I'm going to... No, I don't want to do that.
[108:40.03]Minus stress.
[108:43.40]Flight resistance.
[108:44.30]Disease.
[108:46.94]Put me on a mission to Deletesville.
[108:48.78]No.
[108:49.22]No one has died yet.
[108:51.70]I don't want that to become a reality.
[108:53.00]We'll do this.
[108:53.90]Extra speed.
[108:56.22]I might actually put that on a healer.
[108:58.01]Put it on Egg Salad.
[108:59.93]Egg Salad speed.
[109:01.59]Egg Salad, you're coming on this mission.
[109:03.79]I'm going to trade that one.
[109:06.47]We'll just give the...
[109:09.47]Anybody like damage or anything?
[109:10.51]Damage melee skills?
[109:16.39]No, I'm going to give this to her too.
[109:21.21]Let me go to salad.
[109:25.37]Like less stress and plus 30% healing.
[109:29.34]So I will give the speed to her.
[109:34.15]Okay, that sounds pretty good.
[109:38.58]Negative one, but like a ton of protection.
[109:43.26]Minus one.
[109:45.64]How bad is that?
[109:46.26]What's going to happen if I do that?
[109:54.37]I think that's going to be okay.
[109:55.45]And then you can just take these.
[109:57.45]Who cares what they are?
[109:58.31]Jester.
[109:58.67]That's fine.
[109:59.25]I'll put the bleed back on.
[110:04.63]He'll just go last.
[110:05.55]Okay, that's fine.
[110:07.77]Alright, let's do a lower mission.
[110:10.49]Are there any other bosses I can try?
[110:14.63]Not yet.
[110:15.25]Maybe.
[110:16.85]Boss progress.
[110:17.78]We're almost there.
[110:18.42]We can do another couple missions in the warrens.
[110:25.66]No cove progress.
[110:27.62]Courtyard.
[110:28.20]I don't want to do the courtyard yet.
[110:34.31]Let's go back to the warrants.
[110:35.61]We'll get to the boss of the warrants.
[110:38.11]These are both medium.
[110:40.96]Grave robber.
[110:41.66]That's pretty good.
[110:44.82]I'm going to do this one.
[110:45.82]Medium.
[110:46.70]Let's get the team together.
[110:48.18]You, you, you.
[110:52.52]This poor guy is just at level fucking zero.
[110:55.39]Does this team suck?
[110:58.35]I don't know.
[111:01.87]How bad does this team suck?
[111:08.56]Hmm.
[111:10.10]Team sucks?
[111:16.49]Team kind of sucks, but it's okay.
[111:22.23]Alright.
[111:22.61]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[111:26.93]Go with 4.
[111:28.65]I've used too much food.
[111:29.37]We're gonna go with 16 food.
[111:32.70]We'll go with 8 torches.
[111:35.52]If we get into darkness, it's okay.
[111:36.84]Good.
[111:37.32]More shit.
[111:37.58]Good.
[111:40.41]16 and 8.
[111:40.55]So I'm going to bring a couple of keys, two shovels, and two medicines.
[111:46.99]Let's go.
[111:47.27]If I get close to death once, delete me.
[111:50.87]I don't know about that.
[111:56.70]Anyways, while I have a second here, this is from the past 45 minutes or so.
[112:06.86]Thank you, Sam, for the bits.
[112:07.92]Sam N., one of our mods.
[112:10.10]It's not much, but it's what I can give to charity.
[112:12.05]Hashtag charity.
[112:12.75]Well, thank you, Sam.
[112:15.37]Every bit goes a long way.
[112:18.35]You know, don't feel like, oh, I only have like 100 bits to give to charity.
[112:22.15]And don't, this is not just a me thing either.
[112:23.75]Like, oh, give those to me and then say charity.
[112:26.48]Now, to any stream that you watch, if you have like bits lying around, make sure you do hashtag charity.
[112:31.52]Because no matter where they go, it's a good thing.
[112:35.34]But thank you.
[112:37.36]Evil, thank you for the bits.
[112:38.40]Jerma, you're a real funny fellow.
[112:40.13]Thank you.
[112:42.45]I appreciate that.
[112:45.44]Muse, thank you for the five dollars.
[112:47.06]Absolutely mental streamer clicks on stream.
[112:51.13]I can't help it.
[112:52.39]I have to.
[112:53.81]If I don't click on stream, if I don't, I, it's burned.
[112:56.85]Remember the typing of the dead stream?
[112:59.63]Forget about the fact that I fucked up a keyboard.
[113:01.41]That's burned in my brain.
[113:02.45]I have to type like that.
[113:04.25]You could teach me how to type and it wouldn't matter.
[113:08.76]I've been doing that for, like, 18 years of my life.
[113:11.96]Longer.
[113:13.32]I've been clicking on shit for 18 years.
[113:17.54]Not gonna change.
[113:19.76]Well, thank you, Muse.
[113:21.45]Also, before I, like, burp into the microphone, it'd be really annoying.
[113:26.01]Thank you, uh, Tara, for the two bucks.
[113:27.59]I always thought the reason you hated the Karazhan stream was because it revealed you as a clicker.
[113:32.61]No, the reason why I hated the Karazhan stream was because, like, it was the worst stream I've ever done.
[113:38.89]That's why I hate that.
[113:40.09]That was the worst dream ever.
[113:42.55]Dinner cart.
[113:46.13]Herbs cleanse the meat.
[113:47.63]Holy shit.
[113:50.03]Okay, well now I'm not afraid about eating food.
[113:52.50]That's a good thing.
[113:53.10]Give me a torch.
[113:59.44]Skate 3, but Skate 3 was like potentially funny because of how awful it was.
[114:05.22]Karazhan was just a bad sporing, and it was the longest stream I've ever done.
[114:11.48]Think about that.
[114:13.26]The Karazhan stream was like eight and a half hours.
[114:15.83]It was like a nine hour stream.
[114:19.23]That wasn't just like a 20 minutes.
[114:20.53]That wasn't like a two hour stream.
[114:21.71]That wasn't like a four hour stream.
[114:24.43]Can I kill this guy in one hit?
[114:27.15]Let's see.
[114:27.47]Damn it.
[114:30.96]Karazhan was funny.
[114:33.26]Maybe.
[114:38.26]I forgot about the moves.
[114:40.52]Judgment's the heal.
[114:41.38]That's the stun.
[114:43.04]I want to... I think I can kill this guy right now.
[114:48.09]On medium, you take 16 torches.
[114:50.41]Damn.
[114:55.60]Hey guys, hey, hey, hey, what are we gonna do?
[114:57.52]We're gonna show them the bells!
[114:59.60]I got a long fucking Verizon bill.
[115:03.98]It's a lot of money.
[115:06.02]I don't have unlimited data.
[115:08.17]Even though it says unlimited data on my plan.
[115:11.57]Funny fucking guy over here.
[115:17.57]Ow, this is, okay, he's, I gotta get him out of here.
[115:23.08]Spinalied the guy in the... D'ah!
[115:27.16]He's hoping for a crit.
[115:31.34]Bola.
[115:32.80]Uh-huh.
[115:33.42]And let's do whatever this is.
[115:36.58]Debuff.
[115:41.65]Oh, shit.
[115:44.63]The Jester really does not work with this group at all.
[115:47.23]What a blunder it was.
[115:48.25]Hmm.
[115:53.84]Oh well.
[115:55.04]That's fine.
[116:00.41]Don't need to mark it.
[116:01.11]Just... Lots of stuff.
[116:06.17]Okay, we got a key, right?
[116:08.19]Good stuff.
[116:13.94]Because I have so much food, I'm going to heal the fuck out of this guy and use it until he's full.
[116:21.13]What is this debuff?
[116:22.65]Minus 25 dodge.
[116:24.45]12 rounds.
[116:25.11]That's kind of awful.
[116:29.71]Uh, anyways.
[116:30.69]So, before I sneeze, I'm gonna sneeze, and here comes, here comes... Oh god.
[116:47.56]Oh, my head.
[116:48.08]That made my headache even worse.
[116:55.53]I can't believe I get to go on a quest with the real Jarva.
[117:02.15]A map.
[117:05.80]That's amazing.
[117:06.86]That's like the best thing you can get.
[117:10.44]What's the safest way to explore all the rooms and not have to fight any monsters?
[117:14.64]So we're going to go up.
[117:16.41]We're going to go up, left, up.
[117:19.31]Left, down, left, down.
[117:22.57]That's too many lefts, ups, and downs to remember.
[117:24.53]Hold on.
[117:39.81]Butcher cut, what's up?
[117:43.24]Mmm, I could go for a stab and then a finale, hopefully crit!
[117:56.77]I always get so caught up in using the multi-target moves, but... Maybe it's better off just to try to just kill the guy in the front right now.
[118:06.01]It would have happened.
[118:06.61]He's one health.
[118:08.61]He's dead now because I'm gonna BOLA him.
[118:11.12]No, I'm not.
[118:13.66]That's a priority target.
[118:14.74]That guy's gonna die.
[118:15.58]Heal yourself.
[118:29.80]So, is two, uh, is two Aeroblasts stupid?
[118:34.56]Is that a bad idea?
[118:35.32]I guess I don't know.
[118:40.70]No, it's Aeroblast, actually.
[118:57.16]Aero blast.
[119:02.26]Aero blast.
[119:06.68]Hey, look at that!
[119:07.48]Secret.
[119:08.20]We're gonna double.
[119:12.82]The aero blast.
[119:14.00]What does it do?
[119:14.60]I told you this last stream.
[119:17.02]She shoots arrows into the air and blasts people.
[119:28.33]Jesus Christ.
[119:31.04]That's so much money.
[119:37.10]That is more than 10 fucking grand.
[119:39.82]That is like fucking almost 12 grand.
[119:43.04]In one.
[119:45.08]One.
[119:47.28]Lupa.
[119:48.92]That is a painter right there.
[119:51.36]Ladies and gentlemen.
[119:53.97]Okay, let's go left.
[119:54.63]We're going to explore all the rooms.
[119:56.39]We're going to go up, left, down.
[119:58.34]Because I want to avoid these two fights.
[119:59.86]And this will be the room we don't explore.
[120:02.10]Whoa!
[120:04.02]I feel good.
[120:07.00]I knew that I would.
[120:12.17]I feel not sugar and spice now.
[120:17.75]Okay.
[120:22.70]I was going to scream, but I don't want to fuck you guys ears.
[120:26.10]That would be not nice.
[120:35.92]Don't touch it.
[120:36.42]Don't touch it.
[120:36.88]Don't touch it.
[120:40.53]I was lucky.
[120:46.29]God damn it.
[120:47.61]So good.
[120:49.41]So good.
[120:50.95]I don't want to fight that but I kind of have to
[121:15.84]I didn't say I was a singer.
[121:18.81]I said I was a fucking songwriter.
[121:20.45]Fuck it.
[121:20.87]Just hold on.
[121:21.53]Wait a minute.
[121:22.03]Hold that.
[121:22.53]Hold that thought.
[121:25.05]She's getting stressed out here.
[121:26.45]This is not a good thing.
[121:28.53]Stab that guy.
[121:34.90]I'm gonna be prepared for the voice stream.
[121:36.52]You better believe that.
[121:41.59]Look, I don't feel good right now, so I can't hit the high notes.
[121:45.47]Like, for instance, there's like a... There's like a... And then you can go like... But add a little bit more... No, I can't do that now.
[121:58.59]Not right now.
[121:59.41]Let me try.
[122:03.76]Nope, not gonna happen.
[122:06.86]Sorry.
[122:17.22]Is that a sheep?
[122:37.43]It really was a sheep, you're right.
[122:45.43]Ah, that's great.
[122:47.62]Good observation.
[122:49.22]This sounds like one of those videos of goats screaming.
[123:01.11]Yeah, and I don't even feel good.
[123:03.73]I feel like shit right now.
[123:09.43]Didn't bring enough torches.
[123:10.34]Well, we're gonna be in darkness.
[123:12.96]And we're gonna get extra loot.
[123:14.46]We're gonna get extra stuff.
[123:17.58]And it's gonna be great.
[123:20.38]I can't wait.
[123:24.51]Don't touch that tent.
[123:31.47]Take some voice lessons and I'll be top notch.
[123:34.15]You know, I was in...
[123:37.19]like, the top tier of Chorus.
[123:41.07]Did you guys have that?
[123:42.69]Pile of bones.
[123:53.06]Uh, did you guys have, like, the other, okay, there was, like, you had to take, you had to take Chorus in high school, in middle school, but there was the, like, higher tier Chorus, right?
[124:06.76]There was like another chorus over the chorus, and if you were in the second tier chorus... Damn, you were good.
[124:13.22]And everybody knew it, and everybody respected you.
[124:16.87]That was me.
[124:17.57]I was in that second tier chorus.
[124:19.25]I had a couple of solos.
[124:24.99]Fucking sang, uh... Jump Jive and Whale one time.
[124:29.32]Swear to God.
[124:33.30]Yeah.
[124:34.72]I had a solo.
[124:42.38]DON'T STEP IN THE TRAP, YA FUCKIN' IDIOT!
[124:47.09]Ahhhh, and I had that thing scouted!
[124:53.43]No, you can't sing- Look, look, here's the thing.
[124:55.68]I'm gonna tell you guys a little secret about like, singing and streaming and singing.
[124:59.96]In- in front of people.
[125:02.47]If you are not really good at singing... If you're not like super confident with your singing voice, you might sound okay.
[125:12.78]Like for instance, I can sit here for a second and go like... Like... Somewhere over the rainbow... And like, oh, whoa, that was fucking good!
[125:22.83]You know what I mean?
[125:27.01]But if you're not like confident in your singing voice...
[125:29.79]Like, I can't do that for long before it gets to me.
[125:39.34]Sometimes I can, like, hold... I can hold character sometimes, but not that time.
[125:46.11]Sometimes I can hold the character there.
[125:48.87]Not this time.
[125:57.38]Zelda voices tomorrow?
[126:06.42]Fake streamer!
[126:09.96]Sick streamer goes out- but listen listen like my point is Like if you're not really good at singing If you do it in front of a large audience someone's gonna throw a tomato.
[126:21.53]You know what I mean?
[126:23.89]You'll get red in the face
[126:26.31]You're not like a good singer and you do it in front of people and you show people your singing ability, a bottle's gonna get thrown on the stage.
[126:34.12]And what are you supposed to do?
[126:35.84]You know what I mean?
[126:44.07]Hold on, I guess it's not like healing people.
[126:54.83]How do we even get on this topic?
[126:57.65]How do we ever get on any topic?
[127:01.36]I don't know.
[127:08.92]Obviously, you keep singing.
[127:12.14]But singing is a skill.
[127:14.80]If you claim that you have this skill, singing,
[127:19.75]I mean, like, that's like, okay, if you say, you know what, guys?
[127:23.75]I'm a pretty good singer.
[127:25.39]Like, do re mi fa sol.
[127:27.61]And, like, you're like, oh, wow, pretty good.
[127:29.41]But are you, like, a doctor?
[127:30.33]Are you doctor level?
[127:34.83]I am probably hurting people right now.
[127:36.48]And, like, that kind of makes me laugh.
[127:42.30]But my point is, like, okay, if you're a singer, if you claim that you're a singer,
[127:49.95]and you sing and it's not great.
[127:51.13]That's like saying that you're a doctor on stream.
[127:52.87]That's like me turning on my webcam going, hey guys, uh, today's stream is gonna be, uh, a doctor.
[127:58.37]Like, I'm a doctor and I'm gonna perform surgery on this guy behind me.
[128:01.80]I'm a pretty good doctor.
[128:03.26]And I kill the guy.
[128:05.06]Like, he's just lying there.
[128:06.18]I don't even give him anesthetic.
[128:07.56]He's just like, what are you doing to me?
[128:09.67]And I'm like going into his, like, insides and I'm like pulling out all kinds of weird shit and I'm like, this is a, kids, this is an intestine.
[128:18.00]Like, if I say I'm a doctor on stream, I better be a doctor.
[128:20.80]You know what I mean?
[128:26.50]He's getting delusional from the fever.
[128:27.91]This is move skill.
[128:28.91]Fucking throw it in the trash.
[128:30.01]Alright, I win.
[128:33.19]What's this?
[128:34.37]Bone Altar.
[128:35.75]Altar.
[128:37.41]The Altar infuses the hero with great power.
[128:39.31]Uh-huh.

[130:57.48]Red tea's not real tea.
[130:59.38]Come on.

[137:36.45]You know, there's a couple of computers from like 1998.
[137:39.19]There's Windows XP on those.
[137:42.11]Okay, cool.
[137:43.67]There's an elevator back there and it goes down.
[137:45.11]And you're talking about fucking skull and bones like Illuminati shit down there.
[137:51.62]And I dump it into the fucking Cthulhu box.
[137:56.38]And he comes up and he eats it.
[137:59.06]I don't know where I'm going with this.
[138:00.96]Anyways, thanks for the $15, dude.

[139:11.72]This guy's gonna last the whole game.
[139:17.17]I'm gonna make sure...
[139:19.82]Because you know what?
[139:20.64]Dissenting opinions are okay here, okay?
[139:23.17]You said I suck at this game and I should uninstall it.
[139:25.03]Dissenting opinions are okay.
[139:26.91]You're going to stay here for the rest of the game.
[139:32.37]We don't have to agree on everything.
[139:36.17]You're going to be in the front row the whole time.
[139:41.57]Anyways, thank you Jolting for the two bucks, Jolting for the three bucks, Jolt- Jesus, man.
[139:45.55]So many people are giving money.
[139:46.87]You guys are fucking spoiling me.

[140:25.26]I need, like, glasses.
[140:27.46]Let me start over.
[140:29.09]Hey, do you remember being a fan since the old TF2?
[140:30.75]Your videos are so funny, they always help me laugh, even when I feel down.
[140:34.65]So, good.
[140:36.21]So, God bless you, funny soul, you fucking fraud.
[140:40.23]Go back to TF2.
[140:41.26]Come on!
[140:41.56]You're gonna make me... That was like a nice message, and then you put it in all caps.
[140:46.84]That was in all capitals at the end.
[140:51.04]Forgot to say charity.
[140:51.88]Hashtag charity.
[140:52.38]Well, thank you, Jolting.

[141:18.82]I'm not going to be at Tip of the Hats this year.
[141:21.22]But please go support it.

[141:43.45]So let's go.
[141:45.37]Let's go.
[141:45.69]Let's do a mission.
[141:47.99]We could sit in town for like fucking 15 minutes now.
[141:53.90]But what is Tip of the Hats?
[141:58.16]Let's type in Tip of the Hats 2017.
[142:02.05]And you'll get it.
[142:02.93]It'll be there.
[142:03.65]I promise you, it'll be there.
[142:06.51]Uh, what if it's open?
[142:07.83]Alright.
[142:08.49]I'm telling you, I'm like sick tonight, and my brain is just literally fucking... It's scrambled eggs.
[142:13.45]It just is.
[142:13.79]I've been like that a lot lately.
[142:15.71]How do I fix that?
[142:17.17]What vitamins should I take for that?
[142:18.35]Anybody know?
[142:23.92]I feel like there's like a handful of vitamins I should be taking.
[142:28.86]I don't have any man-at-arms.
[142:30.00]What is this guy?
[142:30.40]What is your disease?
[142:33.59]It's okay, you guys are fine.
[142:34.92]This is the dream team, so we're good.
[142:39.06]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[142:40.68]Nobody has any bleed, really.
[142:42.16]That's fine.
[142:42.74]Uh, these guys are all leveled up.
[142:45.54]We're saving our money.
[142:49.10]Oh, shit!
[142:50.02]Thank you for reminding me, video game.
[142:54.17]I shouldn't take this off, ever.
[142:55.19]That's dumb.
[142:58.59]Uh, here you are.
[142:59.37]Where's the speed trinket?
[143:01.91]Somebody has it on, I think.
[143:08.05]I actually like this.
[143:12.61]Yeah, one of these dickheads has it on.
[143:13.82]Uh, who has the damage one?
[143:18.96]You do.
[143:23.12]And you're also gonna do this one.
[143:26.14]Sure, why not?
[143:30.32]Uh, and... And...
[143:37.13]Who cares?
[143:38.01]No, that's too much stress for the whole dungeon.
[143:45.36]Who cares?
[143:47.52]You can unequip all... You know, I actually don't like doing that.
[143:50.86]Because it takes... There's some people, like for instance the Plague Doctor, I never want this taken off.
[143:54.90]And I will forget that it exists, you know?
[144:03.77]It's Helion only.
[144:07.30]Oh, fuck it.
[144:08.00]Who cares?
[144:08.46]What's the worst that's going to happen?
[144:09.82]He dies.
[144:13.92]Okay, let's go.
[144:16.64]Veteran.
[144:17.02]This one's a medium one.
[144:18.22]This is when after this... Wait, wait, wait.
[144:21.48]Slay the boss.
[144:22.04]Hold on.
[144:22.98]Swine Prince.
[144:25.05]Okay, let's actually do this.
[144:25.97]You guys get out of here.
[144:28.67]Let's bring the ragtag team for this one.
[144:33.65]You need to go both of you guys need to go into the ward I Get so distracted.
[144:40.73]I'm so sorry guys.
[144:41.51]I just get I get so distracted when I play this game So I don't know if I could even I might know I'm gonna have to do that after I don't have enough people to do it No, and she's too stressed.
[144:56.04]So let's de-stress you and
[145:00.64]And that's good.
[145:03.24]Let's just do the veteran mission.
[145:05.30]We actually are going to do it.
[145:11.80]Come on.
[145:12.00]Get in there.
[145:14.10]What?
[145:14.46]Wait.
[145:14.75]Hey.
[145:15.01]Oh.
[145:15.61]What the hell am I doing?
[145:22.23]That works.
[145:22.61]Provision.
[145:23.95]Go for it.
[145:26.62]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[145:34.10]1, 2.
[145:35.06]1, 2.
[145:36.66]1.
[145:37.76]Here we go.
[145:40.68]These guys are just too good.
[145:43.50]Upgrade the buildings?
[145:44.22]I need to... I have to go get the deeds.
[145:47.04]I'm so low on deeds.
[145:48.12]It's crazy.
[145:49.82]It's not good.
[145:55.58]Highwayman's in the wrong place, is he really?
[145:56.92]Am I that much of a fucking brainless idiot?
[145:59.28]I don't have any band-aids.
[146:03.54]It's alright.
[146:04.34]They'll manage.
[146:04.88]They've managed for this long.
[146:09.94]This isn't the boss level?
[146:10.84]Yeah, I know.
[146:12.06]Because I wasn't going to have a healer.
[146:15.70]There was no healer that would have been ready.
[146:17.99]Eggsalad78 was too stressed out to go on a boss run, so... After this.
[146:24.69]Complete 100% of room battles.
[146:26.77]Sure.
[146:27.11]Well, there's two here and there's none up there, so we're going to go left and left.
[146:30.93]That's actually a perfect scout, so I'm happy about that.
[146:33.73]Highwayman, you're in the wrong place.
[146:34.91]I'm going to have to do that every time.
[146:37.81]Remind me.
[146:40.74]Occultist is a healer.
[146:41.84]That's true, but the Occultist cannot go on that mission.
[146:46.28]The Occultist is level 3.
[146:47.68]He can physically not go on a level 1 mission.
[146:50.92]He can't go.
[146:52.14]He can't go.
[146:53.67]I wish he could.
[146:55.15]I really do.
[146:56.07]Occultist is... Why is everybody saying that?
[147:03.85]The Occultist can't go on that mission.
[147:06.81]No, he can't.
[147:08.55]He can't go on that mission.
[147:14.47]Why is everybody telling me that?
[147:17.66]Is this the Swine Prince?
[147:18.90]What mission am I on?
[147:19.84]Oh, no, that's another game.
[147:23.20]If he does, he will explode.
[147:27.00]Only on Radiant.
[147:28.20]Yes.
[147:29.32]We're not playing on Radiant.
[147:30.44]We are playing on Darkest.
[147:33.78]So, that's why.
[147:36.32]Continue the onslaught.
[147:43.40]But I don't blame you for having information scrambled around.
[147:48.10]Because, holy shit, there's a lot of scrambling in this game.
[147:51.06]And he's blight resistant, but it don't matter.
[147:52.74]I have a lot of blight power.
[147:55.52]Should still hit.
[147:56.98]And it doesn't.
[148:03.36]Just swing away.
[148:07.29]Destroy them all.
[148:07.95]That's what we're gonna try to do.
[148:17.53]Oh shit, Jerm is actually good at a video game.
[148:21.31]What?
[148:21.91]Nuh-uh.
[148:22.27]Come on, man.
[148:23.11]Nice Skyrim Dragon Priest mask.
[148:36.46]Is that what this is?
[148:37.02]Is that what it looks like?
[148:39.58]I never actually played Skyrim, so I don't know.
[148:42.84]He has way too many resistances, so we're going to stun him.
[148:46.77]No, we can't do that either.
[148:48.23]Can't do that either.
[148:48.85]Ow.
[149:00.15]Going for a big hit on the... Big hit!
[149:03.78]That's pretty big.
[149:05.34]Pretty good.
[149:13.56]Just try it.
[149:17.54]Come on.
[149:18.70]There's like a 30% chance I'll get it.
[149:20.36]Wow.
[149:20.86]Pretty good.
[149:21.90]Pretty lucky.
[149:25.80]Pigs bleed light yellow.
[149:28.53]Blight's not a great thing to have, but I don't have anybody else's level 3, so... Kind of... Kind of shit out of luck on that front.
[149:37.00]Yeah, that's fine.
[149:40.82]I haven't seen any of the antiquarians.
[149:44.08]Antiquarian.
[149:44.78]Antiquian.
[149:45.10]The antiquians.
[149:47.84]I haven't seen one.
[149:59.50]Don't pick that up, Jeremy.
[150:00.58]Finding the stuff is only the first test.
[150:08.10]Now it must be carried home.
[150:09.44]Is this a medium dungeon?
[150:13.54]How am I already out of shit?
[150:14.72]None of you guys have, like, a slot?
[150:22.73]No.
[150:22.89]That's actually... That's good, though.
[150:25.75]Let me go left.
[150:30.71]Albuquerque.
[150:31.31]Yeah, we're the Albuquerquean.
[150:38.60]Guy in the back.
[150:40.54]He's a priority target.
[150:41.52]He does stress damage.
[150:43.56]He stresses people out.
[150:47.18]You gotta splurge on your supplies.
[150:50.59]Ooh.
[150:53.43]Ooh, nice.
[150:55.09]Very good.
[150:59.34]Slytherin just does so much damage, especially with that trinket on.
[151:03.53]Like... That's just so... 25% damage is a lot in this game.
[151:08.91]It just is.
[151:09.31]I lost you out there.
[151:16.22]No thanks!
[151:22.91]Yeah, Plague Doctor is not the guy I wanted in here, unfortunately.
[151:27.37]So we're just gonna buff the other... Yeah, I can stun.
[151:29.65]Just stun him.
[151:30.23]Just shut him up, you know what I mean?
[151:32.41]Just close his mouth.
[151:33.21]Put a muzzle on him.
[151:42.16]Holy shit, these characters are still alive.
[151:43.50]I know, no one has died.
[151:45.75]Nobody has fucking died.
[151:46.81]And you know what?
[151:50.11]No one is gonna die.
[151:55.00]I'm pretty lucky.
[151:59.30]No, I am highly, highly skilled.
[152:05.40]I'm just gonna kill him.
[152:08.14]Probably not.
[152:11.40]Except for that guy.
[152:12.38]Unskilled.
[152:14.07]Esports.
[152:25.26]Just wait.
[152:25.58]When Darkest Dungeon has their first ever Darkest Dungeon event completion multimedia extravaganza.
[152:36.94]I'll be there.
[152:37.94]They're going to take a look at this team and all the pros.
[152:41.39]They're going to look at this and be like, why the fuck didn't I think of that?
[152:45.63]And I'm going to be like, see?
[152:49.23]Uh...
[152:58.94]Damn it.
[153:00.28]I should have burnt it.
[153:01.04]What am I doing?
[153:08.93]Cultist reminder?
[153:09.73]What are you talking about?
[153:13.25]How can you handle the game?
[153:14.12]Is it too complicated?
[153:15.50]Does it not overwhelm you with choices?
[153:18.00]If you're getting overwhelmed in Darkest Dungeon, just familiarize yourself with, like, a handful of the classes.
[153:25.63]And just play with them.
[153:27.59]There's a lot of stuff.
[153:28.71]There are classes that we haven't even seen.
[153:31.04]There's a fucking werewolf.
[153:33.67]That hasn't even been on the screen yet.
[153:36.51]So there's a lot to take in.
[153:38.71]So obviously you get your dream team.
[153:41.19]Darkest Dungeon Con 2018.
[153:44.39]The Jerma booth.
[153:45.85]Like then this is gonna be a banner on my booth.
[153:48.92]Just this port.
[153:49.52]Just like this image right here.
[153:56.42]There's like fucking hundreds of screaming fans.
[154:06.54]I've lost all control.
[154:07.48]This guy.
[154:07.84]Okay, hold on.
[154:08.38]Wait, wait, wait.
[154:09.30]Hold on.
[154:10.56]Easy.
[154:14.13]Hold on.
[154:15.05]Like, be easy here for a sec.
[154:16.97]I can hit this guy.
[154:17.97]And I really need to.
[154:20.79]No, I'm just stumbling.
[154:22.95]Please stumbling.
[154:27.18]Tens of screaming fans.
[154:30.32]What did I say?
[154:35.37]Standalone class DLC got announced today.
[154:37.53]Did it really?
[154:37.91]I wonder what it is.
[154:40.36]I didn't even see it.
[154:41.96]I didn't even get a look.
[154:44.06]Uh, let's go for the guy in the back.
[154:47.30]Shit, that's too bad.
[154:50.81]Do I have any bandages or anything?
[154:52.95]I don't think so.
[154:56.25]Uh...
[154:59.04]I think I can kill him with the grenade.
[155:01.84]I don't care that he resisted it.
[155:05.56]He needs to die.
[155:16.13]Ah.
[155:18.81]Shieldbreaker is the new class.
[155:21.62]New tank.
[155:22.18]That was a huge hit, unfortunately.
[155:25.40]That was the decider of the whole game right there.
[155:32.56]Only one arm.
[155:34.52]Okay, that's cool.
[155:42.37]110%.
[155:42.39]What else can I do there?
[155:45.29]Plague Doctor was a bad choice.
[155:51.32]This is a cool game.
[155:53.54]Darkest Dungeon is just a cool game.
[155:55.72]All there is to it.
[155:58.10]I'm not going to lie to you.
[155:59.20]I'm not going to say something that I don't believe.
[156:01.86]It's a cool game.
[156:05.46]Now, who knows?
[156:06.02]Maybe like four bosses from now, I might be like cursing the developers.
[156:11.65]But, it's a cool game.
[156:22.83]What is this?
[156:24.21]Sacrificial Stone.
[156:28.42]I really need to read up on these and figure out which ones are like what you have to do to them.
[156:33.06]Just touch it.
[156:33.56]Just put your fucking just take off all your clothes and just scrub on it.
[156:37.13]Oh god.
[156:40.49]That was too much stress damage.
[156:46.15]There's a secret down there.
[156:54.67]Fuck.
[156:56.39]Okay, well, I need... There's a lot of battles here.
[157:00.03]Alright, I need... We need to get that secret.
[157:03.23]I need it.
[157:03.73]I have to have it.
[157:05.87]I need a bandage.
[157:06.67]Okay.
[157:09.85]Shamblu's Altar.
[157:10.92]It says, the sacrifice of fire is the gate to ruin.
[157:13.40]Place a torch if you crave the void.
[157:16.68]So what's the buff you get from this?
[157:27.81]What happens?
[157:39.22]Huh?
[157:47.36]We're gonna fucking win.
[157:48.50]Everybody calm down.
[157:51.15]I don't even know what he does.
[157:52.65]I can't move.
[157:54.15]Move back, move back, move back, move back, move back.
[157:56.65]Easy.
[157:58.41]Easy.
[158:01.59]Easy.
[158:02.59]Just fucking hold on a second.
[158:06.09]Damage and protection.
[158:07.71]Drop his shit.
[158:09.15]Calm down, everybody.
[158:10.97]Just relax.
[158:14.76]Relax.
[158:15.20]I don't know, what are those?
[158:16.78]He just made like two tentacle cupcakes.
[158:19.70]Good, great.
[158:20.36]Good, good, good, good, good.
[158:21.24]Okay, let's be cautious.
[158:23.56]Be smart.
[158:25.29]Two health fucking occultist now is gonna show why he sucks, asshole.
[158:31.45]Good dodge.
[158:40.39]I don't know if I should just... I think I'm just gonna try to focus him down.
[158:49.13]Come on.
[158:50.87]Come on.
[158:51.33]Alright, what do you got for Blight?
[158:53.97]It's not terrible, but it's not great.
[158:59.35]I need speed.
[159:00.61]I need speed on him.
[159:02.07]Come on.
[159:03.53]We gotta go with the speed.
[159:04.35]We're gonna go with the Q. That's what I'm talking about.
[159:09.64]Who needs it?
[159:10.60]Plague Doctor is not that important right now.
[159:12.66]Give me a... Alright, that's okay.
[159:13.72]We're good.
[159:14.24]That's fine.
[159:14.54]I'm okay with that.
[159:26.14]Alright, we're gonna eat a bunch of food.
[159:29.54]Hope you guys are realizing we're just stuffing our faces with fucking hamburgers in this fight.
[159:34.29]I can't.
[159:39.73]Damn it!
[159:40.05]I fucking thought I could hit the guy in the back!
[159:49.35]God damn it.
[159:50.07]I thought that was gonna hit the guy in the back.
[159:51.63]You need to go.
[159:52.53]You need to do a move.
[159:53.55]You need to heal somebody, please.
[159:55.09]For the love of God.
[159:56.31]Heal somebody.
[160:00.71]It's too much resistance.
[160:01.63]I gotta give it to somebody here.
[160:03.39]Speed.
[160:07.20]Just keep it on him.
[160:11.02]Just, plus eight speed.
[160:12.58]Like, that's what's gonna happen here.
[160:15.20]Give me a big crit.
[160:16.72]Oh, dickhead.
[160:17.66]Come on.
[160:21.51]Try to stack Blight.
[160:22.69]He's got 60% resistance.
[160:23.81]We're going to be fine.
[160:28.86]Just everybody calm down.
[160:29.68]Even if they get to... No, there was not a lot of stress here in this situation.
[160:32.90]He's going to die.
[160:41.55]I got to get rid of the guy back here, and we got to put on the counter-attack.
[160:47.11]Give me a big crit, right now!
[160:49.31]Come on!
[160:54.65]What's your stun resistance?
[160:55.57]Way too fucking high, huh?
[160:59.63]Speed!
[161:01.51]Speed!
[161:02.37]Keep it on!
[161:08.46]Hmm...
[161:16.83]Bad strategy.
[161:18.07]Speed!
[161:25.85]Oh god, bird Jerm is at death's door.
[161:29.61]Not running.
[161:30.59]Come on.
[161:34.28]See you in hell.
[161:42.10]Come on!
[161:42.76]Bullshit!
[161:44.12]Bullshit!
[161:46.90]What the fuck?!

[162:09.06]Oh!
[162:15.46]Give me something good no No Come on How was I supposed to know this is gonna be like a fucking secret boss fight?
[162:35.45]I thought it was like I thought I was gonna get like two deeds Why is not working and I hurt anybody I
[162:44.98]I thought I was going to get two deeds.
[162:47.18]Oh god.
[162:49.62]I thought I was going to get deeds.
[163:04.09]We have failed.
[163:04.73]No, I can't run?
[163:06.23]Why can't I run?
[163:10.70]The sin is not in being outmatched, but in failing to recognize it.
[163:38.36]Everyone's fucking fine, okay?
[163:40.18]There's a secret here.
[163:41.86]I'm not leaving without the secret.
[163:43.26]You understand?
[163:45.64]In fact... We're camping right here.
[163:53.79]A moment of respite.
[163:55.79]A chance to steel oneself against the coming horrors.
[163:59.60]Okay.
[164:01.16]Well, good to know that there's a secret boss there.
[164:03.86]Got it.
[164:08.82]Anybody diseased?
[164:11.58]Who's diseased?
[164:14.02]He is.
[164:14.30]Can I remove that disease with him?
[164:16.45]Yes.
[164:17.51]Get rid of the black plague.
[164:23.43]Self only.
[164:26.09]Heal somebody.
[164:26.57]Remove blight and bleeding.
[164:28.98]Now he won't do it.
[164:29.78]My hands shake.
[164:31.18]He refuses to do it.
[164:32.28]That's fine.
[164:33.94]Prevent the nighttime ambush.
[164:35.04]That would be a disaster.
[164:38.40]What about you?
[164:41.36]Anybody else got anything worth doing?
[164:43.58]No.
[164:43.94]Just go to bed.
[164:44.84]Everybody go to bed.
[164:48.32]I'm getting that secret.
[164:50.90]The light.
[164:51.80]The promise of safety.
[164:54.99]Everybody's fine.
[164:56.13]Nobody died.
[164:58.13]You guys all thought like everybody... What is this?
[165:01.45]Hey!
[165:03.83]Hey, wait a minute.
[165:05.23]Wait a minute.
[165:05.83]Wait a minute.
[165:06.65]Hold on.
[165:07.17]Why?
[165:08.24]Get... Get out!
[165:10.78]Go!
[165:11.64]Get out of combat!
[165:14.22]Huh?
[165:17.02]I can't retreat from combat!
[165:20.01]They're on the wrong positions!
[165:26.57]What?
[165:28.23]Oh my god, I gotta bump to the front of the line here?
[165:36.14]Jesus Christ.
[165:39.31]I can't run.
[165:40.09]No.
[165:44.07]No.
[165:45.15]I didn't know this was gonna happen.
[165:46.87]I wanted to get the secret.
[165:48.89]I wanted to get the secret.
[165:52.51]I'm not leaving without the secret.
[165:57.13]Fuck.
[166:00.62]Okay, we're good.
[166:03.88]Give me the secret.
[166:05.76]Give me the secret.
[166:09.37]Just eat a Snickers.
[166:10.65]Eat a Snickers while you're just, just cool it.
[166:21.91]Get me out.
[166:22.85]Get me out of here.
[166:37.68]No way.
[166:39.14]These guys are all level 3.
[166:40.22]I'm not losing all of my top level people.
[166:44.61]Yikes.
[166:46.35]Well, because I touched a fucking stone with a lit torch.
[166:52.53]Well, now we can go fight the other boss.
[166:55.41]Zero deaths.
[166:58.50]Zero deaths.
[166:59.28]Everyone just has a massive amount of issues.
[167:03.20]The Fitz.
[167:07.25]Okay, we're in town.
[167:08.37]We'll never drink, so that's fine.
[167:10.75]I can put him pretty much anywhere.
[167:11.83]Put him in the church.
[167:14.05]Just, like, fucking put him in the cloister.
[167:16.13]What about you?
[167:18.02]Any weird quirks?
[167:19.86]No.
[167:20.80]Somebody has a weird quirk, right?
[167:23.70]Can't gamble.
[167:25.52]I'm obsessed with killing.
[167:26.77]Okay, so just go whip Bird Jerma for a little while.
[167:32.92]Should have had a leper.
[167:34.28]I just should have not.
[167:35.38]I didn't know that that was going to actually happen.
[167:39.54]No, no.
[167:39.94]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[167:40.70]Easy.
[167:47.70]Fuck you.
[167:48.86]That dickhead is sitting in there.
[167:53.78]That stupid asshole is sitting in the middle.
[167:59.25]Can I pull you out of here?
[168:01.97]No.
[168:02.33]Fuck that.
[168:03.31]Ah.
[168:14.50]Shit.
[168:16.60]You guys are, like, all diseased and shit.
[168:19.50]It's alright.
[168:19.94]Don't worry.
[168:20.66]Everything's gonna be fine.
[168:23.30]Let's just... Hold on.
[168:27.05]We're gonna go kill the swine prince.
[168:29.73]You, you, you
[168:34.98]And... And you.
[168:40.47]Okay.
[168:42.47]Alright.
[168:44.01]You guys already have all your shit.
[168:46.69]Except I do want the damage trinket.
[168:49.36]I'm gonna take that from... Who has that?
[168:54.02]You do.
[168:56.18]Take that, please.
[169:00.57]Let's go kill the swine prince.
[169:08.44]This game was so relaxing.
[169:11.43]I want the protection one.
[169:12.19]Who has it?
[169:15.01]You do.
[169:18.59]What happened to my relaxing game that I was playing?
[169:22.93]You brought me to, like, the end of Chrono Trigger.
[169:26.25]And yes, I spoiled the game for you.
[169:27.91]The game's been out since, like, 1996.
[169:28.85]If you haven't played it, then you're never going to.
[169:34.81]No, he's gonna have to be right there.
[169:36.37]The Jester does not...
[169:45.59]Get out of here.
[169:49.17]I like that better.
[169:54.97]I'm playing it right now.
[169:56.16]Let's go back and make sure I have everybody buffed up.
[170:00.60]You hate the Jester.
[170:01.54]The Jester's cool, but the Jester only seems to work in...
[170:07.46]Like a handful of cases.
[170:09.52]You have to really have a party that can dance around and that doesn't mind getting moved around.
[170:13.84]Because he's always jumping around the slot.
[170:18.85]So you have to put him with either other jesters or what, like houndmasters or other people that don't care about getting moved around.
[170:24.83]Alright, let's go.
[170:31.46]Let's go try to kill the swine prince.
[170:34.66]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[170:38.89]Jester985.
[170:40.60]That's me.
[170:42.20]Provision.
[170:44.88]When am I going to play Knack 2?
[170:50.12]I didn't play Knack 1.
[170:54.94]Why would I play Knack 2?
[170:58.08]Isn't Knack just like a platformer?
[171:06.70]Moving around is just a way to play it.
[171:09.54]Is there, like, a build where you can just sit the... I mean, you could sit the Jester in the back.
[171:13.39]At the very back and just play songs and buff everybody.
[171:16.75]And then, like, near the end of the fight, come out and finale someone, I guess.
[171:19.17]But... I guess you could.
[171:24.77]Hey, thank you, Core Fighter.
[171:31.72]I missed a bunch of bits because I got distracted.
[171:33.58]So let me do that first for a minute here.
[171:35.10]I think we left off right here.
[171:36.64]Sir Feline, thanks for the five dollars.
[171:38.18]Still waiting on dens.
[171:39.76]I need another Crusader.
[171:40.50]But thanks for the five bucks.
[172:01.50]uh sticks renegade thanks for the five dollars again can I get in the game for talking shit too hashtag charity uh no nobody can get in the game for talking shit only sometimes only when I like to feel like it but thank you for the five dollars uh don't eat my bananas thanks for the five bucks Jerma did you have braces ever in your life by the way love your streams I'm a huge fan yes I had braces when I was like 17 I think in high school
[172:26.11]I did.
[172:27.19]Uh, Gunther, thanks for the bits.
[172:28.43]Remember when I said I can't believe I'm gonna watch 20 ads for you?
[172:30.73]Well, I just barely got done.
[172:31.91]Love you.
[172:32.19]Well, thank you for the bits.
[172:33.95]Appreciate that.
[172:34.53]Appreciate you going through the suffering of 21 advertisements.
[172:40.74]Thank you.
[172:41.58]Uh, I will catch back up in a... Braceface?
[172:46.18]What do you mean, Braceface?
[172:50.57]He's down here, probably.
[172:52.15]So let's go over there.
[172:55.05]Left and down is the fastest way to get there.
[172:56.69]Left and down.
[172:57.37]Left and down.
[173:03.19]Use some additional herbs on this, right?
[173:08.09]What did that just do?
[173:11.31]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[173:15.57]Okay.
[173:17.51]30% more damage until I... I should have given it to this fucking lady.
[173:22.13]I didn't even know.
[173:22.83]That's so good.
[173:29.46]Wow.
[173:30.38]Okay.
[173:35.10]Why are they already so stressed out?
[173:36.56]What?
[173:37.96]Why are you this stressed out already?
[173:39.42]What happened?
[173:42.13]What?
[173:42.33]I'm confused.
[173:46.25]Shouldn't be that stressed out already.
[173:53.71]Why are they getting so stressed out?
[173:56.23]Why?
[173:56.47]They all don't like beasts or something.
[174:07.33]They all... Hold on.
[174:08.01]Is that what it is?
[174:09.53]Ah!
[174:11.07]What the fuck?
[174:11.67]I went into one room!
[174:14.20]I went into one room!
[174:18.94]That's not even true.
[174:22.22]Gotta get rid of those pigs.
[174:31.55]They were already stressed.
[174:35.25]Not that much, I thought.
[174:36.39]Were they?
[174:43.25]Kill the swine.
[174:48.68]I don't think I even have any stun.
[174:50.10]I got one stun.
[174:52.50]That's a well, I guess, right?
[174:54.82]The little guys are disturbing.
[175:03.21]Yeah, they are really weird.
[175:06.17]Let me do this to the healer.
[175:16.56]Can't really do anything right now with you, can I?
[175:24.31]Gotta get rid of these pigs.
[175:26.65]We got some blood.
[175:39.86]I don't have any more herbs.
[175:41.59]Let's just hope that this is free food.
[175:46.15]It's not.
[175:47.31]It's not.
[175:48.35]In fact, it's blight.
[175:56.76]I don't care about down there.
[175:57.96]We're trying to do the point of the least resistance.
[176:02.80]Which is this way.
[176:03.67]Again, another moonshine barrel.
[176:10.45]Does it have to be violently ill every time?
[176:13.39]Give me another scout?
[176:19.56]No.
[176:27.72]Whatever.
[176:28.16]He's at least at like half stress.
[176:32.08]High noon for gamers.
[176:33.72]It is.
[176:35.41]It is, usually.
[176:39.21]Can mark you.
[176:40.61]I could probably kill you in one hit.
[176:42.39]Yes, I could.
[176:43.85]Nice dodge.
[176:50.84]Either heal or... Yeah, just... No, just... I can probably... Yeah.
[176:55.76]I heal myself anyways with this build.
[177:02.51]What does that do again?
[177:03.67]You transfer shit and you get 30%.
[177:05.93]Okay, that's cool.
[177:09.71]I've got to remember that for next time.
[177:20.56]Really hope the Swine Prince doesn't make everybody go crazy.
[177:37.11]Panic.
[177:38.66]I haven't, I'm not panicking right now.
[177:40.62]Panic?
[177:40.94]What do you mean panic?
[177:41.52]Alright, burn the bones.
[177:47.16]God!
[177:48.51]Ah!
[177:49.69]Ah!
[177:53.69]Stop touching those.
[177:54.57]Just don't even touch them.
[177:56.13]I just get too into it.
[177:58.06]I get too into it.
[177:59.68]I get so into it.
[178:00.64]I want to just rifle my fucking hands through a bit.
[178:04.62]Now we're going to camp here.
[178:06.50]This is where we're camping.
[178:09.54]I don't have really any AOE besides the bills here.
[178:30.00]Bones are good tinder.
[178:32.70]I do have this available now, but let's just go in the back row.
[178:37.60]I have a couple of bleed things.
[178:39.48]I want, like, straight-up AoE.
[178:41.40]Bolas don't do that much damage, and the builds don't do much damage either.
[178:44.20]Tinder.
[178:48.01]As the fiend falls, the fiend's hope blossoms.
[179:01.48]The boss is the furthest from the spawn.
[179:02.92]Wouldn't that make him... Wouldn't that make it the spot that I'm going to?
[179:07.80]No?
[179:07.94]Right?
[179:08.94]Usually?
[179:09.76]I think so.
[179:12.21]Stop panicking.
[179:12.67]Why am I pan... I'm not panicking.
[179:13.63]What are you talking about?
[179:14.93]Panicking.
[179:18.01]I'm doing fine.
[179:21.09]He'll die from the bleed, so let's whack.
[179:26.21]Let's try to kill him this way.
[179:27.29]Okay.
[179:32.79]And take that damage.
[179:35.66]That works too.
[179:39.60]Calm down.
[179:40.56]Why is everybody telling me to... I didn't do anything.
[179:47.21]I'm going to open up this fucking treasure.
[179:48.69]Nice.
[179:51.89]Okay.
[179:54.25]So.
[179:55.45]Camp in here because the boss should be right here.
[179:57.16]We're going to camp right here.
[180:00.64]Camping trip.
[180:02.08]We're gonna eat eight food?
[180:04.04]So.
[180:06.32]Let's see what we got.
[180:12.24]He is... It's alright that he's that low.
[180:15.56]Stress minus 15.
[180:19.71]This is pretty damn good.
[180:25.13]Rats in a maze.
[180:26.93]That's right.
[180:29.31]Mmm...
[180:34.13]Relieve?
[180:35.19]Mentality debuffs.
[180:36.17]Let's see.
[180:37.99]Well, everybody here is religious.
[180:40.95]Except for the Arab list, right?
[180:47.71]I think this is just an easy way to get everybody down.
[180:49.53]Let's do it to him.
[181:01.88]Remove disease.
[181:02.76]Does he have a disease?
[181:03.46]No.
[181:07.31]Should I stress him out bad before this fight?
[181:10.51]Should I make him go nuts right before the fight starts?
[181:17.03]Bleeding Blight.
[181:20.00]I should.
[181:21.60]Sure, why not?
[181:24.26]Yeah, let's do it.
[181:28.82]I'm going to do this as well because I want the damage.
[181:37.74]And then somebody can remove a debuff, right?
[181:41.28]Who can remove the debuff?
[181:45.82]This is correct, right?
[181:46.96]If I use this on her, that removes that debuff, right?
[181:58.05]Do I have this incorrect?
[181:59.85]No.
[182:04.20]Shit!
[182:09.30]Well, let's just make sure he's not stressed out.
[182:12.82]And... Everyone's pretty much healed.
[182:15.66]I don't want him to get that highly healed.
[182:18.62]Use the rope bow.
[182:19.60]I would.
[182:21.63]One companion.
[182:22.29]Let's just drop your stress.
[182:24.39]And let's go to bed.
[182:25.89]And... Hey!
[182:30.85]Hey!
[182:32.29]Hey!
[182:33.03]I wasn't ready!
[182:53.92]Should he eat?
[182:55.10]No.
[182:55.48]Let's go.
[182:56.08]Let's fucking fight this asshole.
[183:01.65]We're gonna go full blast with the light.
[183:02.99]Don't touch the pack.
[183:03.89]Don't touch it.
[183:05.33]It's a good map.
[183:06.41]At least he's crazy now.
[183:10.75]That means he does more damage and he's good.
[183:12.29]Alright, let's go full blast with the light and make sure we got all the... Let's go.
[183:24.01]Well, there's a gigantic guy.
[183:25.39]And this one!
[183:28.81]Now I'm marked.
[183:29.39]This is good.
[183:31.25]Just don't make anybody else go crazy.
[183:32.89]So... Uh... The Swine Prince.
[183:38.31]100%.
[183:38.91]50%.
[183:40.16]So he can't be stunned, but he can.
[183:44.04]Kill the little one.
[183:44.88]Kill the little one.
[183:46.64]Kill the little one first.
[183:48.28]Well... I...
[183:51.84]He's like got 15 dollars so that I got it so no no no no I've played Binding of Isaac before guys Like I'm not gonna kill the little one Don't kill him.
[184:03.43]Now I'm panicking because now I don't know what to believe So we're just gonna go this guy's this guy has no resistances So we're gonna just smash him Kill little guy don't kill little guy like do you understand like how this is not gonna work?
[184:23.11]Should I debuff him?
[184:27.22]Don't let me die.
[184:28.14]I can't stun him.
[184:34.04]Why can I not?
[184:34.62]I gotta go forward.
[184:35.34]I can't, like, stun this guy.
[184:38.96]But we're gonna drop... He doesn't have any dodge.
[184:45.35]Whatever.
[184:45.67]I guess we're gonna... I can't... I'm gonna try for just, like, a...
[184:58.04]Little guy is the boss.
[184:59.16]And that's what I assume.
[185:01.46]But why would you put a huge fucking guy in front of me?
[185:05.66]You know what I mean?
[185:07.89]I'm going to go with... Let's buff mine.
[185:09.91]Let's get super buffed here.
[185:12.73]Wild flailing.
[185:13.47]That's easy.
[185:15.01]Easy dodge.
[185:15.39]Easy dodge.
[185:23.15]So he just marks you.
[185:24.96]And I'm assuming that if you get hit... What the fuck are you doing?
[185:29.40]Really?
[185:29.64]I haven't... Okay, so he marks... He's gonna go for like a mark!
[185:37.64]Get marked!
[185:39.48]I already know it.
[185:40.74]Alright, now this is gonna do a lot of damage.
[185:49.41]Kickin' his ass.
[185:52.92]Oh!
[185:53.20]Oh!
[185:54.44]Well, that was... Oh, no.
[185:56.10]And these two.
[186:18.22]Now he's at death's door.
[186:19.20]Okay, I gotta heal myself.
[186:23.44]Heal... I have to, right?
[186:25.30]Otherwise he's gonna just fucking die.
[186:26.88]I'm gonna lose a bunch of damage, but I have to stay alive.
[186:31.87]So we're just gonna do it to, like, you.
[186:40.83]And... that's fine.
[186:41.91]He can stay there.
[186:42.57]4H plus 6.
[186:45.99]No, he's gonna stay.
[186:46.49]He's gonna stay damage.
[186:50.08]The little guy turns into a big guy stronger if you kill the big one first.
[186:54.38]Are you serious?
[186:57.14]Am I getting, like, fucked with right now?
[187:01.46]He's dead.
[187:04.76]Oh.
[187:05.04]Oh, look at that.
[187:17.58]Look at that.
[187:20.24]It's it.
[187:21.82]Don't kill the little one.
[187:22.86]Okay, sure.
[187:23.66]Let's let him live.
[187:24.60]Let's ask him a bunch of fucking questions.
[187:30.92]Don't kill him.
[187:32.96]Guys, don't fucking... I know everything.
[187:35.33]I know everything.
[187:45.93]He's a terrible...
[187:52.73]Lies.
[187:56.48]I could probably stay down here.
[187:59.70]What do I have for like trinkets and shit?
[188:03.44]Yeah, let's keep going.
[188:05.42]I have plenty of supplies.
[188:06.32]Let's try to get some more out of this dungeon.
[188:14.03]I got at least one more painting out of it, so yeah.
[188:21.29]Believe the badness while you can.
[188:24.29]There's a treasure chest up here.
[188:25.43]I have a key, right?
[188:27.84]I want to open this last key.
[188:29.08]I want to get this last key open.
[188:41.63]My advice for almost every boss in the game is ignore their unique mechanic of whatever it is and just focus them down.
[188:50.80]That's my playstyle too, just kill the fucking boss.
[188:55.34]Kill the boss.
[188:59.71]Alright, I got a Sten.
[189:11.29]Backline.
[189:12.77]No, he's just gonna say a bunch of weird shit.
[189:14.63]That's fine.
[189:17.64]almost every boss well I mean obviously the the gimmick in quotes with the pot alright if I had gotten unlucky and didn't chat with the people that told me that person probably would have been in there forever they would have died
[189:40.71]Can't ignore some of the boss mechanics.
[189:42.37]I'm assuming that.
[189:43.23]But the first, like, three or four bosses in the game, I assume are not that outrageous.
[189:52.08]Open this and we'll get out.
[190:03.15]What are you doing?
[190:06.35]What did he do?
[190:07.45]Okay.
[190:08.37]Well, have fun.
[190:10.81]Have fun.
[190:16.42]Too many cooks in the kitchen.
[190:17.76]Yeah.
[190:18.98]There are just too many cooks in the kitchen right now.
[190:28.07]This is open.
[190:30.41]Worth staying.
[190:31.05]That's a lot of heirlooms.
[190:32.47]I need more pages, though.
[190:33.84]Yeah, that's it.
[190:35.80]Let's go.
[190:39.43]Just assume the chat wants you to lose.
[190:41.35]Everyone was shrieking at you to kill Wilbur, which would have fucked you.
[190:44.33]Especially since getting new players to do that is a meme, like telling new Dark Souls players to open Mimics.
[190:58.46]That's like... That's funny.
[191:01.54]Minus 25% stress if someone has the Crimson Curse.
[191:05.10]Cool.
[191:07.52]We have another level 3 amongst us.
[191:12.59]Look, that's what I... You know, I assume that too, though.
[191:16.47]This is one of those games that has a lot of... There's permanent death for characters.
[191:21.52]There's a lot of scary things that you could run into that'll kill you.
[191:25.58]He ran away.
[191:31.36]Let's take a look.
[191:32.66]So there he goes.
[191:34.52]Courtyard.
[191:38.15]Let's do another high-level mission if I can.
[191:40.33]No, I can't.
[191:41.33]I don't think I can.
[191:47.10]Everyone's too stressed out.
[191:50.20]I've got one... No.
[191:51.64]It's not going to happen.
[191:53.12]We've got to do a low-level mission.
[191:59.44]We could do another... We could just do it at the cove.
[192:05.75]Courtyard time.
[192:06.37]You think I can handle the courtyard?
[192:08.55]Who do I want to bring to the courtyard, though?
[192:10.57]This is what worries me.
[192:14.47]I mean, I guess...
[192:19.14]I guess I could bring these into the courtyard.
[192:21.36]This.
[192:22.40]Maybe.
[192:24.80]Are you still alive?
[192:25.86]Yes.
[192:26.16]No one has died.
[192:27.80]No one has died.
[192:31.73]Apparently I lost connection to my Twitch alerts.
[192:34.99]But I'm going to take another pee.
[192:36.53]I'll be back in like two or three minutes.
[192:40.47]Go get yourself a snack.
[192:41.53]Go get yourself a pee.
[192:44.79]And do what you need to do.
[192:45.41]I'll be right back.
[193:09.59]Yeah.
[195:56.25]Hello.
[196:02.26]Put my headphones back in.
[196:06.40]Back again.
[196:15.72]Mmm.
[196:18.26]I want to bring like level twos in here.
[196:19.92]I don't like this place.
[196:22.70]It freaks me out a little.
[196:28.49]Let's just go to the cove.
[196:34.98]Medium.
[196:37.68]Both medium.
[196:38.18]I want busts.
[196:42.22]Let's do this one.
[196:42.78]We're going to do this one with this team.
[196:46.46]Apparently.
[196:46.92]That's fine.
[196:54.34]Grave robber.
[196:58.92]Let's change your moves a little.
[197:06.82]Put the bleed on, because the cove is blight resistance, right?
[197:13.24]I think, if I remember correctly.
[197:24.56]This guy, whatever, just give this guy a couple of random things.
[197:28.20]No trinkets at all for this guy.
[197:31.53]Yeah, this guy doesn't get any trinkets.
[197:34.69]Cove is bleed resistant.
[197:36.01]Okay, I thought I'm mixing him up here.
[197:40.49]I literally can't be more wrong.
[197:42.54]I flipped him then.
[197:47.10]Why don't I make jokes anymore?
[197:50.72]The whole first half of this stream was a gigantic joke.
[197:56.95]The whole stream was a joke for the first hour and 20 minutes of this stream.
[198:00.35]And then I got tired.
[198:07.45]Because I actually don't really feel that well.
[198:10.62]I don't feel well today.
[198:15.46]That's okay.
[198:16.00]We'll just keep that on.
[198:17.00]No more...
[198:20.98]Let's do this one.
[198:21.68]Stress is... I don't care about the stress heal right now.
[198:27.10]This whole channel is a joke.
[198:28.26]Ban everybody.
[198:29.92]Ban the whole chat.
[198:32.11]All fucking 1900 people.
[198:33.91]Get it?
[198:34.17]Like, ban permanent.
[198:36.57]I want to turn my stream on tomorrow.
[198:38.81]And I want to see all the list of all these names.
[198:41.11]Because I'm going to read them all.
[198:42.63]I'm going to read them all with my glasses on.
[198:46.95]And I'm going to remember all your names.
[198:51.49]Mom of you out.
[198:53.37]This is just a shitty... It doesn't matter.
[198:55.55]Let's just do this.
[198:56.11]We got like a couple of fucking... Shitties.
[199:00.27]Just ate food and like... Five torches.
[199:03.27]No.
[199:03.59]Not even.
[199:07.29]No.
[199:07.61]You know what?
[199:10.92]Ate food.
[199:11.76]Three torches.
[199:12.66]No.
[199:13.44]This is a darkness run.
[199:15.14]Let's get some money.
[199:20.32]This is a darkness run.
[199:22.65]See if I can do it.
[199:30.99]Go.
[199:33.03]Tell the infamous eggshell story.
[199:37.03]What?
[199:40.18]I didn't say anything, Jeroboam.
[199:43.92]And... see you later.
[199:47.56]Darkness.
[199:48.68]The darkness holds dominion.
[199:51.77]Let's do a darkness round.
[199:53.21]Let's get a bunch of items.
[199:54.45]Too bad I don't have an antiquated area on the team.
[199:57.57]You know what I mean?
[200:01.30]What's that debuff?
[200:01.70]It's a tiny dodge.
[200:05.96]Whatever.
[200:07.62]Quickly.
[200:07.98]Hurry up.
[200:13.16]Big fight.
[200:13.56]Let's go.
[200:15.63]Should've brought an anti-venom.
[200:16.85]I know, it's my own fault.
[200:22.96]I've been told to ban the whole chat.
[200:25.24]Yes!
[200:26.88]No, not everybody.
[200:28.28]Only, like, 75% of every person here.
[200:31.20]This guy... Let's get rid of the stress, people.
[200:39.39]These Bulkies got me a die.
[200:52.11]debuff.
[201:01.62]Just heal.
[201:02.96]Or stun this guy.
[201:04.04]What's the stun percentage here?
[201:09.36]I got a little bit left.
[201:12.02]I got some darkness saved.
[201:14.34]Some light took over.
[201:16.57]Lightness.
[201:20.27]I don't think this is going to hit anybody, but at least I can try.
[201:26.85]This finale is going to hit this dude.
[201:33.56]Not yet.
[201:34.76]Just stab the guy in the front then.
[201:43.44]You are going to take three points, so that's six.
[201:52.52]It's not gonna kill him.
[201:53.12]It'll kill him next time.
[201:56.80]Could chat in jebaited mode?
[202:00.30]Why?
[202:01.72]What did they do?
[202:02.23]What did they do that was so awful?
[202:04.31]What'd they do?
[202:05.89]What happened?
[202:06.23]What'd they do this time?
[202:07.09]Shit, he's getting sharded.
[202:10.95]My bad.
[202:12.57]My bad.
[202:16.48]Is it really in jebaited mode?
[202:18.68]It is.
[202:22.95]It actually is intubated mode.
[202:24.63]How do you do that?
[202:25.89]How do you do that?
[202:28.35]Wow.
[202:29.97]70% more damage.
[202:38.44]Whoa.
[202:40.46]We were more fun than you, Jerry.
[202:44.04]Funny streamer.
[202:45.44]What?
[202:47.46]Try to complete darkest.
[202:48.66]I'm trying to get to the end.
[202:49.62]I'm in the Darkest Dungeon right now.
[202:50.92]I'm trying to get to the end of the game.
[202:57.52]That protection is annoying.
[203:04.06]Long have we waited.
[203:04.96]Sub mode outdated.
[203:06.05]Emote mode overrated.
[203:07.63]Jebaited mode activated.
[203:09.13]Is that... You're gonna throw, like, copy pasta at me now?
[203:13.97]I die from that blight.
[203:22.57]I hate these beefy assholes.
[203:24.09]They're so hard to get rid of.
[203:28.06]Oh shit.
[203:30.24]I wasn't even pa- I'm sitting here looking at like the chat about like jebaiting.
[203:34.82]I'm not even paying attention to like this run.
[203:43.42]I'm sitting here just staring at the chat and clicking like random buttons.
[203:49.79]It's alright, I can camp.
[203:53.07]Pull that down a little.
[203:53.93]I don't have any bandages.
[203:57.57]Go back to fucking total darkness.
[204:01.87]I might have to turn the lights back on.
[204:06.23]Nothing must be left untouched.
[204:07.59]Oh, goodness.
[204:11.45]Alright, well, good for you.
[204:15.06]Good for you, man.
[204:18.60]He touched it.
[204:20.12]I got four of the same enemy.
[204:27.01]They all have no resistance that we'd like.
[204:29.50]Good.
[204:32.76]I will take that to my event.
[204:38.90]My chat experience.
[204:45.99]Why have we gone into coffee pasta mode?
[204:48.63]As the fiend falls, a faint hope blossoms.
[204:56.89]These guys are tough.
[204:57.59]There they are.
[205:00.66]What is happening in this chat?
[205:03.90]What happened?
[205:06.90]Oh, classic.
[205:07.76]A classic Jupiter.
[205:12.38]Ay yi yi.
[205:17.97]I actually might call it a night after this, by the way.
[205:21.61]I'm like... I'm very, very tired and fairly ill, and I want to rest up for tomorrow.
[205:32.66]Turn off Slowbo and see what happens.
[205:34.34]I... Why?
[205:43.89]Cure my illness before the stream ends.
[205:45.53]I'm gonna upgrade these buildings.
[205:48.33]Big time.
[205:57.57]Chaos?
[205:58.05]What are you talking about?
[206:01.29]I mean, this chat is chaos.
[206:02.53]The game is actually also chaos.
[206:05.38]Alright, we're gonna finale this guy.
[206:10.52]That was a lot of damage.
[206:16.75]Just lunge forward and kill this guy and he'll die from this bleeeed light, whatever it is.
[206:25.45]Post a book before this dream is over.
[206:31.54]No.
[206:33.14]No.
[206:33.80]Oh, I got some blood.
[206:35.26]Yeah, let's go.
[206:40.64]90% of rooms explored.
[206:45.77]Well, this is lucky.
[206:47.47]We can go bang and then come back up and left.
[206:50.13]And then we don't have to do this last room over here.
[206:52.73]I'm not even close and like everyone's about to have a fucking heart attack.
[206:56.33]Should I turn the lights back on?
[206:57.29]I might have to turn the lights on.
[207:03.72]I don't... I can't.
[207:04.88]I don't have any torches.
[207:07.68]What is this?
[207:16.40]What do I use here?
[207:18.20]I'm afraid to touch this.
[207:20.16]Medicine?
[207:23.42]With what torches?
[207:25.80]Holy water.
[207:26.28]I don't have any holy water.
[207:28.44]Let's just grab it.
[207:29.53]Let's just grab at it.
[207:35.49]Okay.
[207:37.59]Eldritch Slayer.
[207:42.67]Let's find out.
[207:44.71]It was worth seeing, for sure.
[207:48.45]So let's go left and then back and then up.
[207:51.21]We have to do a lot of backtracking and I really desperately am going to need to do an early camping trip here.
[208:07.64]Back it up.
[208:09.78]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[208:13.29]Panic.
[208:14.35]I'm panicking right now, as you can tell.
[208:19.62]One message per week.
[208:21.22]Yeah, guys, I'm gonna enforce some new chat rules here where you get to make one message per week.
[208:27.78]What do you guys think?
[208:30.86]You know, if somebody did that, that would... All you guys would have some really carefully crafted messages, right?
[208:39.07]What if I allowed one message per week, but there was a, like, 500 character limit?
[208:45.99]Like, you could write, like, a paragraph.
[208:54.10]Well, we're not going that way.
[208:55.48]We're going to go around.
[209:00.66]You might think this is a waste of time, but I don't want to take any unnecessary damage from that fight.
[209:04.87]So I'm going all the way around.
[209:08.03]Basically, sub-mode... No, no, no.
[209:09.57]You get one message per week.
[209:13.17]But you can write a fucking paragraph.
[209:17.43]I'm going to be fine.
[209:20.99]Somebody would just use it up and do all e-bones.
[209:32.75]Why am I so scared?
[209:34.83]We are in... Don't even take it.
[209:38.71]What the hell is that?
[209:45.83]He just sounded like he was laughing with that line.
[209:53.94]But he was like poking his belly with a stick during that line.
[210:04.06]The chat is... God damn it.
[210:06.49]This is wasting so much food.
[210:07.91]Now I can't like... I might not be able to eat.
[210:11.03]I have to camp like now.
[210:13.79]Unfortunately.
[210:14.69]In this next room we gotta camp.
[210:20.73]One more.
[210:21.67]Don't make me eat again.
[210:23.17]So I can camp.
[210:26.50]He's mocking your incompetence.
[210:30.88]Well.
[210:32.38]Oh, he's laughing at the terrible things I opened up?
[210:34.06]Oh well.
[210:37.83]A lot of walking in this.
[210:39.95]Sure.
[210:44.01]Let's camp here.
[210:49.21]Eat it up.
[210:52.57]If anyone gets hungry again, this is gonna be bad.
[210:59.10]Well, I have no more food.
[210:59.90]Let's do... Yeah.
[211:05.84]Fuck everybody else.
[211:13.76]I like that move.
[211:14.74]Cool.
[211:15.10]Nice.
[211:15.78]Yeah, yeah.
[211:16.34]Do it to you.
[211:17.30]Do it to you.
[211:17.96]What else we got?
[211:23.09]Religious stuff.
[211:27.55]It removes the disease.
[211:28.27]Who has a disease here?
[211:29.21]Somebody does.
[211:29.65]At least I thought they did.
[211:31.95]Oh, nobody does.
[211:35.13]Okay.
[211:35.57]Well, whatever.
[211:38.79]Self-only scouting chance.
[211:40.43]Minus 15 stress.
[211:41.13]This is a heal.
[211:53.66]You got a heal, right? 15%.
[212:02.44]Hey!
[212:03.88]Hey!
[212:05.22]Why did you... What the hell was that for?
[212:06.74]Well, let's get ambushed.
[212:10.93]Almost there.
[212:12.93]Four war rooms.
[212:26.93]And what's going on here?
[212:29.05]Excuse me.
[212:29.91]Excuse me, I want to be pitch black.
[212:38.46]Okay, I just looked over and I just saw, like, a random paragraph.
[212:41.62]Am I posting Jupiter now?
[212:47.66]Past my bedtime?
[212:48.89]No, I'm just sick.
[212:50.47]I'm just fairly ill.
[212:52.43]But I'm having fun.
[212:54.07]I do like this game a lot.
[213:02.64]And you get... No, you know what?
[213:04.44]Can I just... There we go.
[213:06.84]That's better.
[213:08.32]No sense waiting like three turns to kill him.
[213:11.62]Really?
[213:20.73]Turn the lights off.
[213:23.35]Come on.
[213:25.05]Black as pitch.
[213:26.97]You got pushed back here somehow.
[213:30.23]He's doing a lunge.
[213:40.00]Oh, well.
[213:40.82]I really thought it was going to happen.
[213:45.28]Whoops.
[213:47.28]Whoops.
[213:55.46]This poor guy just keeps getting pushed back.
[213:59.10]He looks like something.
[214:00.24]What does he look like?
[214:04.46]It's like a Mega Man character or something.
[214:07.42]I don't know what it is.
[214:10.32]I'm sure I'll figure that out at some point.
[214:11.88]Later tonight, I'm going to figure out what that is.
[214:15.06]And I'm going to scream.
[214:15.82]I'm going to be like, Mega Man 2!
[214:25.86]C-3PO?
[214:26.38]Maybe that is like a Star Wars character.
[214:28.08]No, he looks like a... I don't know.
[214:31.75]I don't know what it is.
[214:35.61]Iron Man?
[214:37.66]Yeah.
[214:38.08]A combination of Iron Man and Batman.
[214:44.32]Oh, no.
[214:46.52]I knew this was going to happen.
[214:51.85]I still have three keys.
[214:53.27]I can't get a chest or anything?
[214:55.11]Come on.
[215:00.47]This color looks off.
[215:01.27]Alright, let's put some herbs in there.
[215:07.25]I'm going to pretend that me putting the herbs in made it better, but that's not the case.
[215:12.80]Completed.
[215:14.40]I'm going to go to the next room.
[215:18.38]I think I still want to collect some icicles.
[215:20.00]I've got plenty of room in my inventory.
[215:21.28]I have three keys.
[215:39.84]I can stack some shit, you know?
[215:47.50]I'm like leaning back in my chair with my hand in my mouth just clicking.
[215:50.66]Fight these fish people.
[215:58.96]That's pretty good.
[216:02.38]Oh, look!
[216:04.06]Treasure!
[216:04.74]I don't have any torches to fuck with it, so I can just touch it.
[216:09.80]Not touching that again.
[216:10.72]Okay, come on.
[216:18.53]There's gotta be one, like, chest in here that I can open, right?
[216:23.35]No, get me out of here.
[216:27.41]No, we gotta do it, right?
[216:31.14]Let's get like four stacks.
[216:32.66]Oh, shit.
[216:41.33]Still using the leper.
[216:42.95]I am.
[216:43.29]I like the leper.
[216:44.61]I don't hate him.
[216:54.12]Debuff, debuff, debuff, debuff, debuff.
[216:55.88]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[216:56.88]Sure.
[216:58.96]Watch that resolve, please.
[217:01.97]Now I pushed him back.
[217:03.15]Ah, I'm so stupid.
[217:05.89]I shouldn't have pushed him back that far.
[217:09.34]That's great.
[217:14.02]Greed's going to be my undoing.
[217:15.34]Why is that?
[217:17.00]Hmm.
[217:17.14]Let's try to kill this guy.
[217:26.35]Shadow Fade, and it's a stun.
[217:28.05]I think I can just kill him with this.
[217:31.77]I'll give you the Leper.
[217:33.23]Don't go crazy, Jester.
[217:34.85]I know you have enough to do, but don't do it.
[217:40.00]I do like the Leper.
[217:40.98]He does a lot of damage.
[217:51.26]He does a lot of damage, even though he's very inaccurate.
[217:55.08]I like his hue.
[217:57.46]I like that one a lot.
[218:02.28]Do you think we want to play Duck Game again?
[218:05.41]Do you consider playing Duck Game again with your friends?
[218:08.39]You got a new update.
[218:11.95]Probably not.
[218:12.73]I mean, this kind of just... I don't know.
[218:17.25]Duck Game was cool.
[218:20.80]I don't think I can play it again.
[218:22.00]I kind of got everything I wanted out of it.
[218:23.62]Alright, last room.
[218:29.88]Let's hope that we can get some stuff out of it.
[218:32.76]There it is.
[218:33.58]Open the door.
[218:37.44]FTL.
[218:38.90]No.
[218:40.38]FTL is a little just too much.
[218:43.04]It's too much.
[218:43.74]It's not that I don't like FTL.
[218:46.24]This is not good.
[218:51.27]It's alright.
[218:52.59]A trip to the brothel will cure you, fix you right up.
[218:55.35]Don't worry.
[218:55.73]The FTL is a little too much for me.
[219:00.58]I'm not really into that.
[219:06.18]As much as it's an interesting game.
[219:10.02]How is FTL too much?
[219:11.26]I tried to play it a long time ago.
[219:14.28]And I don't know if it's something about the way the game is presented.
[219:18.13]But it just doesn't do it for me.
[219:21.52]Just don't.
[219:22.02]I'm not gonna lie.
[219:22.74]It just doesn't do it for me.
[219:31.18]I gotta be careful here.
[219:34.67]Should have healed, but I was going with the risky play.
[219:41.43]Have I ever played Borderlands?
[219:42.57]Yes, I have.
[219:43.75]Oh shit.
[219:47.26]It's gonna kill himself.
[219:50.38]It's an acquired taste for sure.
[219:56.44]The concept is cool.
[219:57.35]It's got a really steep learning curve, but it's super fun once you know how to play.
[220:04.15]I can see that.
[220:08.25]Everyone's as stressed as they could.
[220:16.03]No, people are gonna start to die here.
[220:17.93]Like, otherwise, I'm gonna, like, blow this whole thing.
[220:22.11]I got, like, too greedy.
[220:24.21]Oh, fuck me.
[220:27.21]No.
[220:28.61]No!
[220:30.10]No, no one can die in any of my... In any of my runs.
[220:34.14]No one's allowed to die.
[220:36.68]No one.
[220:37.66]You understand?
[220:38.86]No one is allowed to die.
[220:42.42]Thank God.
[220:50.36]We're fine.
[220:53.28]No.
[220:58.74]Don't have a heart attack.
[220:59.94]Do whatever you want, but just don't have a heart attack.
[221:01.52]And I'm gonna finale.
[221:03.16]I'm gonna get up here and I'll instantly kill someone.
[221:05.90]Finale is up to what?
[221:06.80]40%?
[221:06.94]There's no bleed on him.
[221:09.87]He's gonna be fine.
[221:15.44]No bleed.
[221:18.61]Okay.
[221:19.21]Just keep him alive.
[221:21.19]Ah!
[221:23.19]He refused it.
[221:24.17]That's fine.
[221:24.83]Shit.
[221:29.43]Don't hit him.
[221:36.66]Just throw one dagger.
[221:37.80]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[221:41.44]Oh my god.
[221:47.52]Alright, we do it all over again, apparently.
[221:55.44]Focus the shaman.
[221:56.32]I can't attack the shaman right now.
[222:00.67]People are doing all their own shit.
[222:03.11]Everybody's gone crazy.
[222:08.33]Sorry, we got a little bit of light.
[222:09.35]Turn the lights off.
[222:11.55]You threw a dagger at a dead body.
[222:15.01]Nice job.
[222:19.51]Just let him die.
[222:20.12]No big deal.
[222:22.00]No.
[222:22.42]Darkness.
[222:22.88]Off.
[222:23.64]Lights off.
[222:25.54]Good.
[222:25.96]Here comes the finale.
[222:26.76]Finale.
[222:26.96]Easy as pie.
[222:27.96]And... We... Who has like the worst day?
[222:33.63]Who's having the worst day right now?
[222:51.79]I have all these keys, man.
[222:54.69]Oh well.
[222:55.11]Okay.
[222:55.77]Complete.
[222:57.95]Have you played any of the Arkham games?
[223:04.57]Yes.
[223:08.39]I've not completed any of them.
[223:09.81]I've played Arkham City, I've played a little bit of Arkham Asylum, but not to the extent that I've played Shadow and Mordor.
[223:20.93]Alright, who's got levels?
[223:22.91]Two, two, two, three.
[223:24.37]We got two level threes now, good.
[223:28.87]Virtue.
[223:30.05]We haven't seen any virtues at all.
[223:33.43]Compulsive, evasive, that's good.
[223:38.03]Alright, suffers intense need to do specific actions.
[223:44.94]What specific actions?
[223:46.22]I love how they say specific actions.
[223:50.19]Without giving any specifics.
[223:56.32]I think you'd really like the Shadow of Mordor game.
[223:57.96]It's one of my favorites.
[223:59.06]That's one of my games of the year for like 2014.
[224:02.08]I love Shadow of Mordor.
[224:04.52]Can't wait for the new one.
[224:07.63]Okay.
[224:08.51]So.
[224:08.77]We have a lot of money.
[224:12.79]A lot of stuff.
[224:16.31]I...
[224:18.06]I'm really really not well I have a pretty bad headache And I kind of made it worse earlier by being like a psycho for like 30 minutes So I'm gonna I'm gonna clock it out tomorrow night.
[224:30.91]We're gonna be I'm gonna be back here strong with some more PlayStation 3 There's a handful of games that we can get through should be a fun night.
[224:40.20]Hope to see you there I'm gonna buy a bunch of sexy pay-to-win clothes
[224:47.59]Yeah, it didn't really feel like a great start in the stream, but I did want to play.
[224:50.64]Because this game is really fun to play, and it's pretty fun to stream it, too.
[224:54.92]Seems like it's interesting enough, right?
[224:58.74]Anywho.
[225:00.34]Thank you guys so much for watching.
[225:02.64]We may probably continue Darkest Dungeon.
[225:08.64]Because I like to play it.
[225:10.12]And I'm into playing it right now, so... Here, I'll promise you this.
[225:14.69]I will get...
[225:16.93]at least a full party to level 5 on stream and attempt the Darkest Dungeon at some point over the next week or two.
[225:27.20]That will happen.
[225:29.14]Win or lose, you choose.
[225:32.42]And I choose to do that.
[225:35.24]Because I'm, like, having fun.
[225:36.52]6 is the highest?
[225:39.67]Well, whatever level we can get them to.
[225:44.34]When am I going to do the courtyard?
[225:45.42]The courtyard scared the shit out of me because I got attacked by an alligator.
[225:50.64]But let me read some bits before we go.
[225:54.10]Thank you for sticking around, everybody.
[225:55.08]Appreciate it.
[225:57.02]I am... spent.
[226:01.28]My brain needs a little bit of a lie-down sesh.
[226:08.06]Anywho, thank you to... Let's go back...
[226:14.70]I guess we'll start from here.
[226:16.75]To the courtyard next time, thank you, Ben, for the bits.
[226:19.09]I will.
[226:20.29]Sir Squeegee, thanks for the four dollars.
[226:21.93]Oh, I feel like shit.
[226:23.35]Boss skimping my hours.
[226:25.09]Here's some bits, Jerma.
[226:26.07]Your stream always makes me feel better.
[226:27.69]Cheer, cheer, cheer, cheer.
[226:29.55]Well, thank you, Sir Squeegee.
[226:32.58]Hopefully you can afford that shit.
[226:34.72]Like, if your boss is squandering your hours, then I don't think you should be giving me any money.
[226:43.61]Go buy a fucking... Go buy like a burrito.
[226:46.37]But I appreciate it, man.
[226:47.75]Thank you so much.
[226:48.37]It's very kind of you.
[226:51.58]Evil.
[226:52.16]Thank you, Evil, again for the bits.
[226:53.36]I'll just keep throwing bits at you.
[226:55.34]You can't stop me.
[226:56.28]Hashtag charity.
[226:56.98]Well, thank you, Evil.
[226:58.48]Nobody can't stop you.
[226:59.30]You're right.
[227:01.74]Nick.
[227:02.20]Thank you, Nick, for the $1.
[227:04.64]Using some bits to reach out.
[227:06.34]You might benefit by using Jester as support.
[227:08.84]His stress heal is very good.
[227:10.24]Just a suggestion, but good job so far.
[227:13.68]uh yeah that's earlier I was talking about putting just him in the back and leaving him back there and just using him as like a buffer but some of his moves are so good that finale does so much damage if you can build it up that's like a boss killer if you can jump around a jester for half of a boss fight you'll do what's the cap on that is there even a cap on how much you can buff the gestures finale and just do like a hundred fucking damage in one swing
[227:42.91]That'd be kind of cool.
[227:45.33]But.
[227:46.51]Finale was nerfed and it's still great.
[227:48.99]Apparently.
[227:50.34]It seems like a great move still.
[227:52.92]But thank you, Nick.
[227:54.78]Also, thank you to Ben again.
[227:56.26]Chat is slow and insidious killer.
[227:59.86]Chat was... What are you talking about?
[228:01.00]Chat was nuts.
[228:03.13]I looked over and Chat fucking freaked out.
[228:07.21]Jubeida was in there.
[228:08.03]We were doing like copy pastas.
[228:09.96]Zoom in on this, by the way.
[228:11.34]Take a look at that.
[228:12.20]Oh, no, I'm not even on the right screen.
[228:13.18]I was gonna do the fucking fly joke again.
[228:16.48]But, uh, thank you, Ben.
[228:18.02]Emperor Zoro, thanks for the bits.
[228:19.10]That's it, man.
[228:19.62]Game over, game over, game over.
[228:21.00]I'll see you soon, though.
[228:22.58]I'll be playing this again.
[228:24.78]Core Fighter, thanks for the one dollar.
[228:26.58]Take what little money I have.
[228:27.83]I believe in you, Jerma.
[228:29.23]Hashtag charity.
[228:29.91]Thank you, Core.
[228:31.87]Never trust a purple.
[228:34.63]Thank you.
[228:36.03]Fun fact.
[228:37.87]First of all, thanks for the five dollars, Purple.
[228:40.45]Fun fact, once summoned, the Shambler will show up in place of every fight until you die or kill it.
[228:47.33]Also, every time the tentacles land an attack, they get a stacking buff to all abilities.
[228:52.28]Don't fuck with the Shambler unless you're confident you can kill it.
[228:55.32]Huh.
[228:58.47]Well, good to know.
[229:01.03]Thanks for the tip.
[229:02.81]In both regards.
[229:03.61]Thanks for the tip, and then thanks for the tip.
[229:06.44]Sir Feline, thanks for the $5.
[229:07.56]If you had dens, you would have won.
[229:08.94]Hashtag charity.
[229:11.50]I promise I'll get a fucking dens in there.
[229:13.48]I'm going to spell his name backwards.
[229:15.36]He's going to be like an occultist.
[229:18.05]Thank you for the $5, Sir Feline.
[229:22.73]Corn on the Rob, thank you for the $1.
[229:26.65]Duke Nukem, thank you for the $15.
[229:28.19]So I've been getting into making cocktails and I'm curious what's your favorite if you have any.
[229:32.93]Hashtag charity.
[229:35.91]My favorite cocktail is probably just a whiskey coke.
[229:39.86]Just whiskey and coke.
[229:41.20]Doesn't have to be anything special.
[229:43.12]Doesn't have to be like a super... You could do like just Jack and Coke.
[229:45.68]It's easy.
[229:46.68]It tastes good.
[229:47.98]It doesn't fuck with you too much.
[229:49.54]As long as you don't go overboard.
[229:51.36]That's probably my favorite cocktail.
[229:53.44]If you want to know one.
[229:55.04]But if I had my way, I would be drinking cider.
[229:58.68]I'd be drinking hard cider.
[229:59.84]That's like my favorite alcoholic quote beverage.
[230:04.30]But thank you for the $15 Duke Nukem.
[230:10.05]DoctorDude bro, thanks for the bits.
[230:11.71]Give them a quarter.
[230:13.95]I take it, thanks.
[230:16.01]Wasting time and space, thanks for the ten bucks.
[230:19.59]Uh, you have no idea how long I've been milking the watch ad for five bits system.
[230:25.28]Hashtag charity.
[230:27.22]Five bits per ad, one thousand bits.
[230:30.66]Five times ten is fifty.
[230:33.90]Fifty?! !
[230:35.67]times ten is a hundred.
[230:38.29]A hundred times fifty is a thousand.
[230:42.41]Wow.
[230:44.14]So you watched, you watched, you watched fifty ads.
[230:48.50]You watched a hundred and fifty ads.
[230:50.32]Holy shit.
[230:51.84]Thank you.
[230:58.22]Thanks for the ten bucks, dude.
[231:00.00]Uh, Crip World, thanks for the three dollars.
[231:02.42]Hashtag charity.
[231:03.92]Also, he said hashtag charity in the last one.
[231:05.60]Don't know if I said that.
[231:07.86]Sometimes I forget that the guy narrating your deep, dark adventures is just your really shitty, angry grandpa.
[231:12.87]Shut up, grandpa.
[231:13.63]No one cares what you think.
[231:16.25]He has, like, a main character.
[231:17.27]And he's always, like, having sex in the brothel.
[231:19.99]Let's see if he's there.
[231:20.69]Oh, is he?
[231:24.07]No, he's gambling right now.
[231:26.14]Yeah, for some reason, that guy, the caretaker, he's always just having sex in the brothel.
[231:32.68]Come on, man.
[231:34.82]But thank you.
[231:35.98]For the three bucks.
[231:38.45]I think I'm all caught up at that point.
[231:43.73]Yeah.
[231:45.11]That's it.
[231:45.43]Thanks a lot, everybody.
[231:49.33]The ancestor is the narrator?
[231:50.67]So who the fuck is the caretaker?
[231:52.43]Who is this guy?
[231:54.87]Who is this guy?
[231:58.05]Who the fuck is this guy?
[232:00.67]That's not the narrator from the beginning of the game?
[232:05.99]Why is there just a random guy in my fucking village?
[232:08.71]That's just some guy.
[232:13.06]He's just a dude.
[232:16.00]I thought that was the narrator, like, gambling and getting, like, shit-faced and, like, having sex and stuff.
[232:20.62]Alright, well.
[232:22.28]Well, never mind.
[232:24.06]Why is there only one guy?
[232:26.62]Oh, well.
[232:28.11]Anyways, good night, everybody.
[232:29.37]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[232:30.51]PlayStation 3.
[232:31.73]We'll have some fun.
[232:32.93]Good night, good night, good night.
[232:34.41]See you tomorrow.
[233:20.34]Thank you.
