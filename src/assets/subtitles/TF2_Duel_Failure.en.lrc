[00:04.64]Look, that IP is for Upward.
[00:06.84]I hope you... Welcome to Upward.
[00:09.06]You're on your way to Upward!
[00:10.82]And when you get on Upward, join Red.
[00:15.23]Please be Upward.
[00:16.05]I have my fingers... No, I... It's Asteroid!
[00:20.43]I knew that was the joke, but deep down, I wanted to believe that this wasn't gonna happen.
[00:27.96]You wanna do a 1v1 like the good old times?
[00:30.38]You wanna 1v1 me?
[00:31.64]Yeah, I do.
[00:32.78]I want a 1v1 you as a Demoknight.
[00:36.04]And this will decide who is the true reign supreme pizza.
[00:39.90]This decides who eats the most pizza, okay?
[00:42.98]Whoever wins this 1v1 duel eats the most pizza, and we can finally settle it, okay?
[00:48.56]Okay, because we haven't been able to figure that out since, I don't know.
[00:51.85]We've been in massive arguments about who eats more pizza, and I think it's me.
[01:01.07]Did that not even hit you?
[01:02.79]Uh, did I say you could use?
[01:04.03]Did I?
[01:04.63]Did I?
[01:05.49]Are you breaking the rules already?
[01:06.83]I said Demoknight.
[01:09.16]Just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:10.48]I didn't even mean to pick that health up.
[01:11.88]Just hold.
[01:12.56]Oh, ha ha ha.
[01:13.20]It's so funny.
[01:13.98]Oh, ha ha.
[01:18.64]Alright, you ready?
[01:19.61]Yeah.
[01:21.11]So... I challenge you to a duel.
[01:23.33]Challenge you to a duel.
[01:24.81]Demoknight only.
[01:26.29]No, like an actual duel.
[01:27.41]Like, you should accept.
[01:28.94]I don't have notifications turned on.
[01:31.40]So press, like, J or I or something.
[01:33.16]That wasn't even you.
[01:34.74]I didn't even kill you.
[01:36.14]See, that's why I was trying to... Did you hit J?
[01:39.00]Did it work?
[01:40.16]Oh, yeah, it worked.
[01:41.06]See ya.
[01:43.18]Did I win?
[01:47.92]Alright, I see you.
[01:49.14]Alright, you know the drill.
[01:50.68]Come, uh, not over there.
[01:52.58]Come over where I am.
[01:54.70]Okay, I'm coming at you.
[01:55.94]Follow your teammates.
[01:57.96]Watch out for this guy.
[01:59.30]Go up here.
[02:00.87]Up, okay.
[02:01.57]Perfect spot.
[02:02.03]There's a Demoman up here, but it's okay.
[02:07.15]Hey.
[02:07.79]Alright, so in the meat... Why are we doing this?
[02:18.52]It's gonna... Alright, where are we going?
[02:21.12]Where are we going instead?
[02:24.30]Did you get it?
[02:24.72]Are you out here?
[02:25.29]Are you coming?
[02:25.63]It's that simple, buddy.
[02:27.35]Alright.
[02:28.67]There is a... Okay, your whole team is coming out at the moment.
[02:32.67]We need to... Go over to the right.
[02:35.59]You know, like the right where you can go down and drop to where the health pack is?
[02:38.83]Yeah.
[02:39.47]Go down there.
[02:40.82]That's where we're gonna do our duel.
[02:42.68]That's where we're gonna do our back-to-back duel.
[02:45.66]Ten paces, just like...
[02:53.62]Nice.
[02:55.22]Nice.
[02:55.52]You come over here as a soldier?
[02:57.12]Yeah.
[02:58.82]I thought it would be a nice duel to show the duality of man.
[03:02.17]Like, the demo versus the war update?
[03:05.19]Remember the war update?
[03:06.09]No, no, this, no, no.
[03:07.27]And whoever wins this duel gets the Gunboats.
[03:11.51]Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second.
[03:12.81]What did you just say?
[03:13.89]Whoever wins this gets the Gunboats.
[03:15.65]Whoever wins this gets the item, the Gunboats?
[03:17.77]Yes.
[03:18.21]Get me out there quick.
[03:19.75]Are you serious?
[03:21.37]Gunboats, I gotta get them.
[03:27.04]Okay, please go demo.
[03:29.24]I am.
[03:32.78]Where?
[03:33.90]You haven't changed.
[03:35.18]You have not changed yet.
[03:36.94]Come here.
[03:37.24]I think you can... Yo, I'm not gonna change.
[03:39.71]Yeah, I'll show you.
[03:40.39]I'm getting those gun bolts.
[03:41.39]I want them and I'm getting the pizza.
[03:43.31]I'm... Hold on.
[03:43.81]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[03:44.89]Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[03:47.53]Do not screw this up.
[03:54.13]I'm winning the duel.
[03:57.79]Wanna see what we do?
[03:58.73]Thinks he's so funny?
[03:59.73]Oh yeah, laugh it up!
[04:01.11]Laugh it up.
[04:03.33]I'll show you how funny it is.
[04:05.05]Thinks he's so goddamn funny.
[04:06.47]You think you're such a comedian, don't ya?
[04:08.35]You think you're so funny, don't ya?
[04:11.17]Rage heavy.
[04:12.39]Rage heavy.
[04:13.85]Rage heavy.
[04:15.37]Rage heavy!
[04:18.55]So it's like an old school duel.
[04:20.67]Like back in the old times, like a- get a vintage ambi.
[04:23.95]Okay, where are we doing this where we can have like a minute over?
[04:26.81]You know what?
[04:27.11]It's probably over here by the way far behind the spawn.
[04:29.47]I'm just going to cloak through and die because I have the kunai.
[04:33.68]So just Cloak and Dagger through.
[04:35.14]We're going to go all the way back to this gray gravel door.
[04:42.60]Gray gravel.
[04:44.01]It says old geezer draft beer.
[04:48.03]And you're not going to do an MLC_St3alth and shoot me as I walk there.
[04:51.78]No, no, no, no, no.
[05:05.28]If only you could aim, you would have completed the joke.
[05:09.14]It's time for the duel.
[05:11.02]Don't do it.
[05:12.18]I made the stupid mistake.
[05:13.94]You don't have to make it again.
[05:14.86]Okay, so we're gonna go back to George Washington times.
[05:21.05]Okay.
[05:24.63]That's what happened to George Washington.
[05:29.55]Back to back.
[05:30.89]We're going to do 10 paces, okay?
[05:33.05]Okay.
[05:33.84]So right here, so I would start like right here, and you just hit W, one, two, three.
[05:38.86]So turn.
[05:39.86]Turn.
[05:40.34]Turn around, make sure you're turned.
[05:42.92]And now we're gonna do 10 paces, are you ready?
[05:44.62]Okay, yes.
[05:45.95]Ready?
[05:46.67]Yeah.
[05:47.41]One, two, three.
[05:53.23]You can't bullshit a bullshitter, buddy.
[05:56.07]I knew you were gonna do it.
[05:58.39]I just wasn't prepared.
[06:00.55]You turned around on two or three.
[06:03.09]We both were at fault on that one.
[06:05.74]Were you just waiting the whole time for me to turn?
[06:07.74]Yes.
[06:09.52]Oh, you weren't even honorable at all.
[06:11.98]I didn't even do the first turn.
[06:17.51]Can we do a real one?
[06:18.51]Yeah, we're going to do a real one.
[06:20.99]Turn.
[06:21.25]I want to see you turn.
[06:22.71]Look, I want to turn.
[06:23.85]We're going to turn at the same time.
[06:26.11]I'm going to turn and you're going to shoot me.
[06:28.68]We only have 30 seconds.
[06:29.78]Turn, turn, turn, turn.
[06:31.40]I'm going to trust that you're turned as well as I am.
[06:33.03]So you ready?
[06:33.43]10 paces.
[06:34.37]Hit W 10 times.
[06:35.31]Ready?
[06:36.21]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[06:41.93]That was very stressful, I got to say.
[06:47.79]I hit a wall.
[06:50.53]Here, you go on that side.
[06:52.11]I'm going to go this way.
[06:53.07]Yes, you go that way.
[06:54.85]It's our turn.
[06:57.31]Okay, I'm not turned right now.
[06:58.93]I just want to make that very clear.
[07:00.43]So you don't think that I'm trying to screw you up.
[07:02.21]I just wanted to make sure that... Okay, turn, turn.
[07:04.71]Okay, we're both turned.
[07:05.33]Ready?
[07:05.89]Yeah.
[07:06.09]Five paces.
[07:07.52]One, two, three, four, five.

[07:15.76]Son of a bitch.
[07:17.76]New duel.
[07:18.28]No, no, no.
[07:18.70]New duel.
[07:19.14]New duel.
[07:20.84]Okay.
[07:21.60]Are you now turned?
[07:22.64]I'm trying to bump into you.
[07:23.86]I'm making sure you're there.
[07:24.82]Yes.
[07:25.44]Okay, you're there.
[07:26.02]Okay, yeah.
[07:26.94]Okay, make sure we're like, boom!
[07:28.84]Count to five, turn.
[07:30.56]We're having a real duel this time.
[07:32.18]Okay, count to five.
[07:32.94]We're having a real duel this time.
[07:34.38]Count to five.
[07:34.84]Are you ready?
[07:35.76]Yes.
[07:37.12]Ready?
[07:38.56]Go.

[07:48.65]You put on Uber?! !
[07:51.78]out of all the things you could have done.
