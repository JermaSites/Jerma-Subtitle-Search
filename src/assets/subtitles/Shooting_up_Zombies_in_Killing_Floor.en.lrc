[00:00.51]to the thing before you kill the rest of the 10.
[00:03.93]So let's just walk down this alley.
[00:08.21]Wait for me.
[00:09.51]God.
[00:12.04]I wish you could run.
[00:12.80]I just healed triple cheese.
[00:15.58]Tom, thanks for the heal.
[00:18.02]I gotta heal Boo.
[00:18.40]Did you leave Boo behind?
[00:19.54]I gotta get Boo.
[00:20.50]Boo.
[00:21.46]I'm coming in five seconds.
[00:22.62]I'll rescue you.
[00:24.18]Oh my God.
[00:24.90]Jesus.
[00:26.02]I healed bum squeeze.
[00:27.14]There we go.
[00:27.58]Thank you very much.
[00:28.58]It's still coming.
[00:30.39]The squeeze appreciates your service.
[00:32.13]There we go.
[00:32.53]Oh, we can, like, close doors.
[00:35.01]Close them out.
[00:35.49]Is everyone in this game English?
[00:37.29]Yeah.
[00:37.41]Yep.
[00:38.52]We're in West London, after all.
[00:39.92]This is a pretty big place.
[00:59.79]Is there something on the floor over here?
[01:01.07]Yeah, there's a shotgun.
[01:01.99]Pick it up, sell it.
[01:03.07]And some ammo.
[01:06.03]Yeah, I picked it up.
[01:06.75]Thanks.
[01:06.91]After this, we gotta get out of this place, because this is not a good place.
[01:09.26]Yeah, this is a terrible place.
[01:10.34]We've got 30 seconds.
[01:11.12]Let's, like, immediately run back outside.
[01:13.22]Ooh.
[01:16.16]Dual pistols, eh?
[01:18.46]I'll take them.
[01:19.51]Alright, watch out.
[01:20.15]Things might just, like, jump on top of you and appear in front of you.
[01:24.04]Wait.
[01:26.76]Where did Brett go?
[01:29.80]It's so dark.
[01:31.95]Alright, let's make our way into the street here.
[01:39.51]Oh, wow.
[01:40.19]They're hopping over the edge.
[01:41.78]Oh, man.
[01:42.34]Run!
[01:44.02]Yeah, get in this tunnel right here.
[01:45.71]I don't even know where we are.
[01:47.19]Triple G, come on.
[01:51.89]No!
[01:52.01]He was killed.
[01:53.51]Oh, no.
[01:54.77]Don't worry, you respawn in between rounds.
[01:56.59]I was trying to heal myself.
[01:59.23]Oh, jeez.
[02:00.11]Where did you come from?
[02:02.39]Shit.
[02:03.41]They're everywhere.
[02:04.97]I'll be honest.
[02:05.81]Alright, I threw a grenade.
[02:07.57]Wait, I think I threw a grenade.
[02:08.45]What did I throw?
[02:08.99]I don't know what kind of grenades I have, to be perfectly honest.
[02:11.23]They don't seem like the explodey kind.
[02:13.57]I've noticed we're doing a lot of backpedaling into other groups of zombies.
[02:17.45]Yeah, yeah.
[02:21.57]There we go, he almost fell.
[02:22.45]That was a screechy thing, dude.
[02:24.09]Yeah, the screamer.
[02:24.81]Oh, out of ammo!
[02:25.97]No!
[02:27.37]Oh crap, I need to reload.
[02:30.98]Get outta here!
[02:32.38]Reloading slow-mo, look at that jump.
[02:34.12]Nice little hop there.
[02:36.78]You were like in mid-air, just cruising in slow motion.
[02:40.16]There's only three left, we're right next to the trader.
[02:43.69]Uh, Dermot, you're probably gonna spawn a little distance away, so just pull out your knife and you'll run faster.
[02:50.03]I love that you have the Pyro skin from TF2.
[02:51.77]Where'd you get that?
[02:52.50]I don't know, I just got it.
[02:55.50]He's been waiting for people to notice.
[02:59.40]Yay, traitor!
[03:01.58]Dang.
[03:02.22]You mean this guy like Duke.
[03:04.72]Oh, man.
[03:05.28]Hey, lady.
[03:06.40]This is difficult.
[03:07.88]Did I lose my machete?
[03:11.15]Yeah.
[03:11.49]MK23.
[03:13.83]Oh, I thought it was gonna be a light machine gun.
[03:19.91]Oh, why did I buy this thing?
[03:23.01]It's got awful iron sights, the Mac-10.
[03:24.61]It's like looking through a keyhole.
[03:28.47]We're like halfway through the game and Boo's still going around with dualies.
[03:33.93]Hey, I still have like a magnum.
[03:36.47]Where's our friend Duke?
[03:37.79]He's trickling in slow motion somewhere.
[03:39.11]I don't know where he is.
[03:39.99]That dude's coming down this hallway though.
[03:43.74]Oh, Jesus.
[03:45.36]You're cloaked.
[03:45.74]That was a nice bit of gore there.
[03:47.66]There's another one right next to you.
[03:49.50]Oh, more of them.
[03:52.78]Gore.
[03:53.12]Gore.
[03:55.28]Watch out, we got a jumper.
[03:56.46]Oh, they're jumping down from the roof here.
[03:57.92]We shouldn't stand so close.
[04:00.58]I'm glad there's no friendly fire in this.
[04:02.79]Or I'd have killed you all by now.
[04:03.75]Oh, yeah, that would be horrible.
[04:06.85]Grenade going out, boys.
[04:09.83]For no reason.
[04:12.73]This thing shoots so fast, I just spend a lot of time reloading and shooting.
[04:18.23]Should just stick to the pistols.
[04:19.80]What does the person in the straitjacket do?
[04:24.22]She screams and deflects projectiles.
[04:27.88]And it hurts.
[04:29.70]Yeah, it hurts.
[04:30.62]Quite a bit.
[04:34.05]That shotgun looks fun.
[04:35.19]Oh jeez, there's just someone on that corner.
[04:39.38]Slow-mo grenade toss!
[04:42.48]Well, that guy got through.
[04:43.34]Alright, we gotta sprint.
[04:46.74]This raider's pretty far away.
[04:48.46]Run!
[04:51.00]Sprinting as fast as I can.
[04:52.82]Hey, don't lock me on.
[04:54.89]Hey, I found Duke!
[04:57.01]There he is.
[04:58.11]He was defending another sector.
[04:59.39]What's going on?
[05:00.43]He's got like a fraction of his... Oh, we can't get in.
[05:03.37]Brett welded it, didn't he?
[05:05.79]Asshole.
[05:07.14]How do you de-well the door?
[05:09.96]You press five twice and then I think middle mouse click.
[05:13.37]Hopefully no one wanted to buy anything.
[05:15.69]I'm abusing the game mechanics because you guys don't know how it works.
[05:24.15]Oh, AK.
[05:24.97]There we go.
[05:26.17]Now we're talking.
[05:29.59]Oh, big grenade.
[05:31.25]Go on.
[05:31.73]Me too.
[05:32.57]Everybody throw a grenade.
[05:33.85]Yeah.
[05:35.12]There we go.
[05:35.40]I'm not really sure what my grenade's good for.
[05:37.70]It looks like it's poisonous or something.
[05:42.12]Seems like it could be.
[05:43.30]Killing more.
[05:46.98]How do you kill all those big chainsaw guys?
[05:48.52]They're meaty.
[05:51.60]There's one right there.
[05:55.13]Jesus!
[05:55.51]Is he dead?
[05:58.37]I can't kill him!
[05:59.77]Oh my god!
[06:00.67]Jesus, get him off me!
[06:03.88]You almost got him wow tanky This one has zero range that's fine.
[06:23.09]I'll take it so did you guys know that we're made of stone?
[06:26.95]Listen to what happens when you hit each other with a knife Yeah, baby.
[06:31.07]I'm made of bricks
[06:34.06]Oh, Mr. Chainsaw Guy now.
[06:35.70]Here we go.
[06:36.70]You and me.
[06:39.43]Get away, chainsaw!
[06:40.45]No, no!
[06:41.35]I got you.
[06:41.65]Get the chainsaw.
[06:43.27]He's so difficult to kill.
[06:45.87]I know.
[06:49.57]Get closed off.
[06:52.59]Get closed off on.
[06:55.04]What's Duke doing?
[06:55.86]Dude!
[06:56.38]You've got no armor.
[07:00.66]I don't know.
[07:01.04]He's pretty crazy out there.
[07:02.24]He's about to get snuck up on by a load of people.
[07:04.73]He's got a chainsaw guy.
[07:09.03]Chainsaw guy's got nothing on me.
[07:12.85]Triple Cheese was killed by a chainsaw guy.
[07:14.98]You're like a kill by a snake.
[07:18.66]It said Skrake.
[07:19.54]I think their names are Skrakes.
[07:21.18]I don't remember which one's a Skrake.
[07:22.42]I got bit by a snake in my heel and it killed me.
[07:26.80]Does he have a chaingun, that guy?
[07:28.68]Oh, this guy's like a deep grinder, dude.
[07:31.54]Oh, wow, thank you.
[07:32.58]Oh, Christ.
[07:33.36]Help!
[07:40.13]Oh, I tried.
[07:42.11]Hey, chainsaw guy behind us.
[07:44.45]Kill him first.
[07:47.01]Okay.
[07:48.29]I see.
[07:52.01]Oh, we got him.
[07:53.34]I'm running out of ammo.
[07:55.98]I need to reload.
[07:57.92]I've only got two mags on this thing left.
[08:00.22]There's only ten guys left.
[08:10.33]I need to do my job as a medic and heal.
[08:14.11]There's a big fat guy behind us.
[08:16.71]Well, it looks like he does.
[08:17.67]He goes down pretty easy.
[08:19.73]Sometimes you can find him on the ground as well.
[08:23.66]I'm actually going to get one of the animal boxes.
[08:25.90]Oh, the M4 shoots too fast for some good.
[08:28.14]That's actually going on your head.
[08:30.46]We're standing right under where they drop from.
[08:31.82]Yeah, he just jumped out.
[08:37.28]He hopped down right on top of you.
[08:39.66]He's just bouncing around up there.
[08:41.20]Hi, how's it going?
[08:41.92]Nice to meet you.
[08:43.32]Oh, there's a bunch dropping down.
[08:47.51]Oh, behind you, Dalek.
[08:48.51]A lot of dudes.
[08:49.93]Behind you, Dalek.

[09:01.58]Look at these.
[09:02.02]Look at these pro swings.
[09:04.54]This guy want to go?
[09:06.52]It looks like you're swinging at nothing.
[09:10.68]It's in slow motion.
[09:11.84]I just see you just, like, spinning.
[09:14.36]Oh, this guy's gonna jump right into the axe!
[09:15.40]Oh, big dude, big dude, big dude!
