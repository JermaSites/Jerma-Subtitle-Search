[00:01.39]Hey.
[00:15.72]So today we're going to play Red Dead 2 again.
[00:19.22]Pick up where we left off last night.
[00:22.00]As long as we're able to stream here.
[00:26.11]Hi.
[00:26.55]Hi.
[00:27.03]Hey.
[00:28.17]Reformed Jermo?
[00:29.33]What do you mean reformed?
[00:32.36]What was wrong with me?
[00:33.16]Wait, are you talking about because I'm early?
[00:37.88]Well, those of you that did not like the 7 p.m.
[00:42.00]Eastern time start, you'll be pleased to know that that's probably not going to happen very often for a long time.
[00:52.73]The new schedule, when it comes out, that's some point here once I can get a reliable baseline of connections.
[01:02.47]This is the time that it will probably be starting each day.
[01:07.38]Somewhere around 2 p.m.
[01:08.56]Pacific.
[01:10.08]Between 1 and 2 p.m.
[01:11.42]Pacific is really when I want to start the streams.
[01:15.82]So, 7 p.m.
[01:17.80]Eastern is probably not going to... I mean, it might happen sometimes.
[01:21.24]Just because, oh, I've got something to do, or I'm sorry, I'm a little late, you know.
[01:26.75]But the stream is just going to be pulled back about two hours from what you were used to before I left.
[01:34.89]Dude, I'm Pacific.
[01:37.96]I'm Pacific.
[01:39.62]Me, really?
[01:40.82]Me too, man.
[01:42.48]Wait, hold on.
[01:43.36]You and I are both Pacific?
[01:46.82]Sick.
[01:48.37]Is that 5 p.m.
[01:49.17]Eastern streams now?
[01:52.09]Usually.
[01:52.47]I haven't set it in stone yet, but like I told you before, there's no schedule now.
[01:57.53]Essentially here because I wasn't able to stream for so long and who knows we might get cut off today, too.
[02:02.64]I don't know Because I wasn't able to stream for so long the plan here is From just to just go every day Like I'm ready.
[02:12.64]I want to stream, you know, I want to play these games.
[02:14.48]I want to hang out I want to do all these things it there's gonna be stream probably every single day For at least the next full probably week If that is if I'm able to with the internet, you know what I mean?
[02:26.51]I
[02:31.85]stop stalling but like my like intro screen hadn't even been on for three minutes stamina streamer goes every day this is okay it's not a stall if it's the opening cut scene
[02:55.25]When we were playing Red Dead, when Arthur Morgan gets introduced, it's not like, oh, Rockstar, you're fucking stalling.
[03:01.80]No, you're like getting the introduction to the game.
[03:03.72]This is the stream introduction.
[03:12.04]You guys don't even know how to command me, right?
[03:14.39]You guys don't even know how to make me walk forward.
[03:17.41]We haven't even gotten there yet.
[03:25.46]forward.
[03:25.98]Hey, don't do that, man.
[03:27.70]I just like actually fucking hit my elbow too.
[03:31.70]Right in the funny bone.
[03:35.80]My hand is killing me right now.
[03:37.68]I bumped it right on the edge of the chair here.
[03:40.72]Ah.
[03:44.52]Not very funny, is it?
[03:46.20]Bind W plus forward.
[03:50.34]Alright.
[03:51.24]I think we can get going here.
[03:52.10]I just want to give a
[03:55.66]Give a minute.
[03:59.85]When's the green screen stream?
[04:01.31]For the people that weren't here yesterday, I'll wait.
[04:02.83]We'll do the update again.
[04:05.65]Fuck, man.
[04:06.03]I really fucked myself up.
[04:10.24]But, okay.
[04:11.24]Let's go like this, and then let's go like this.
[04:13.42]Hey, you know what that is, don't you?
[04:17.90]Yeah, that's exactly where we left off last night.
[04:20.92]In Red Dead Redemption 2.
[04:25.30]Did you play without us?
[04:26.02]I absolutely did not.
[04:28.36]This is the exact location where I stopped the stream last night.
[04:31.67]I did not play a second.
[04:36.13]The power of rest mode, PS4.
[04:37.73]Yeah.
[04:40.13]You can just put it in rest mode.
[04:41.39]I can just press the button right now.
[04:43.98]He's lying?
[04:45.18]What?
[04:45.48]I didn't do anything.
[04:53.24]Where's my gun?
[04:54.46]Yeah, I... I... We're not doing that shit again.
[04:58.58]I'm moved.
[05:01.16]From where?
[05:01.62]Okay, I may have walked, like, three or four feet, because I wanted to make sure, like, it was captured correctly, but... Look, I'm sorry, but for the end of a broadcast to come back and be within, like, a quarter of a mile vicinity, that's the same place in a video game.
[05:19.29]Holy shit, somebody just gave $50.
[05:24.91]50 bucks from Scripps3.
[05:25.81]Uh, thank you so much, Scripps.
[05:30.10]Hey, Jerma, so a couple of us in the Jerma Discord community have gotten together and compiled a small list of things we think could be done to improve the Discord.
[05:37.80]And wanted to see what you thought about it.
[05:41.40]Oh, well, let me... Let me, uh... This is probably an off-stream thing.
[05:53.18]This is a lot here.
[05:55.92]Let me go over this off-stream.
[06:02.48]There's a lot of information there.
[06:05.71]Once the stream is over, I will take a look at that.
[06:08.61]I'll bring it into the mod channel.
[06:11.41]And we will talk about it.
[06:16.77]Thank you for the feedback.
[06:19.53]And the $50.
[06:20.06]It's a huge amount of money.
[06:26.16]Discord chat is seceding.
[06:31.80]Let me look at it off-stream.
[06:34.38]I think that's more appropriate, rather than be like, okay, so the first, like, 45 minutes of the stream is going to be talking about the Discord.
[06:41.72]Alright, so, but thank you for that.
[06:45.27]Your feedback does not go on unheard ears.
[06:47.73]I can assure you that, for sure.
[06:51.01]So let's see what we were doing.
[06:54.66]So we're banned from being over here, right?
[07:00.77]I'm not allowed over here, right?
[07:02.31]The whole world shut down.
[07:05.03]So let's just go... I want to do some hunting.
[07:07.69]Hold on, here's John.
[07:11.22]Let's just get the ball rolling here.
[07:15.46]Is Cox under control?
[07:18.38]I don't know.
[07:21.22]That's essentially completely up in the air.
[07:24.34]I have absolutely no idea.
[07:29.18]All I know is what I see.
[07:31.19]And what I've been told.
[07:32.35]And what I see is it's been pretty perfect for two or three straight days now.
[07:38.98]Which was unheard of up until three days ago.
[07:43.02]But here's the thing, what I've been told.
[07:44.30]So that's what I see, but here's what I've been told.
[07:46.90]I've been told that maintenance is aware of it, and they know what's happening.
[07:53.34]But they're not necessarily sure it's been done yet.
[07:56.08]So I don't know.
[07:56.96]I just know what I see.
[07:57.66]Can I see green?
[08:00.83]So green means go, right?
[08:10.91]Ooh, that's- we gotta go this way.
[08:13.05]I wanted to, like, just relax and, like, hunt and maybe learn how to fish.
[08:17.83]Do I need some help?
[08:23.46]What do you mean, do I need some help?
[08:25.22]What do you mean, do I need help?
[08:31.94]Like, in the game?
[08:33.84]Yeah, I'll give a green screen update.
[08:41.26]Hey, Jeremy, do you need some, like, help, man?
[08:44.54]Yeah, could you go over and fucking press a few buttons for me?
[08:48.54]He means mentally.
[08:51.81]Yes, I'm fine.
[08:52.95]I'm fine.
[08:53.43]I'm very fine.
[08:55.57]Never been better.
[08:56.75]Upstairs here, inside of the brain.
[08:59.15]What's up, Dutch?
[09:00.60]I am.
[09:06.36]Fun.
[09:08.50]I'm having a party.
[09:12.38]Oh, I get to be part of a party?
[09:18.29]The gang are celebrating the safe return of Sean and will be unavailable for other activities.
[09:26.01]We get to have a party.
[09:29.32]I forget everything I was just doing.
[09:30.54]That's the beauty of Red Dead Redemption 2.
[09:36.27]They just keep giving you things to do in place of the thing that you went to do in the first place.
[09:41.65]I don't even remember what I was doing over here.
[09:43.21]Now we're just having a party.
[09:45.71]Look at all the party symbols.
[09:47.98]Start singing.
[09:48.70]Where's my beer?
[10:00.30]Oh, now that somebody's looking at me, I won't sing.
[10:29.27]I wish I could just do this off the horse.
[10:31.11]Where's my beer?
[10:32.29]Oh, in here.
[10:32.97]Beef, crackers, peas, brandy, there it is.
[10:35.78]We gotta open this can of rum here.
[10:38.14]Here we go.
[10:50.46]Let's go actually to where the music's coming from.
[11:00.97]Alright, stop singing.
[11:02.65]Let me grab a beer.
[11:08.27]Ah, there it is.
[11:10.31]Let's sip on some beer.
[11:14.14]How many of these am I allowed to have?
[11:15.20]Holy shit, he just drained a whole beer.
[11:22.30]I get to sit here and just drain booze?
[11:29.77]Stop playing as yourself.
[11:31.19]I've got coffee in my hand right now, dude.
[11:33.93]Dude.
[11:39.00]Nobody can even hold this much liquid.
[11:40.50]You know what I mean?
[11:45.27]Alright, here's a question.
[11:45.95]Is that music actually playing, or is that, like, am I too drunk?
[11:48.93]I'm hearing music.
[11:50.29]That's not how alcohol works, I'm just curious.
[12:00.08]It's playing clown music.
[12:02.72]Oh yeah, when you drink too much, you just start fucking hallucinating.
[12:18.14]Oh, I'm still going.
[12:18.92]How many are in here?
[12:19.54]This is unhealthy.
[12:23.26]Like, if I was at this camp, I'd look over here and be like, Arthur, Arthur, Arthur, hold on now.
[12:29.17]I don't care.
[12:29.93]Just get out of my way.
[12:33.25]Arthur.
[12:34.95]Arthur.
[12:36.45]If I should've.
[12:47.69]Don't stop.
[12:48.56]Don't ever stop this.
[13:00.33]This clown music really making this even worse.
[13:02.99]This depressing French clown music.
[13:13.98]Big bits!
[13:14.66]Oh, Jesus.
[13:16.76]Timmy, thank you Timmy96 for the $50.
[13:22.92]Thank you so much, Timmy.
[13:25.80]Somebody edited the Germa River Wikipedia page so that Natalix Power Plant is next to it.
[13:34.91]Why?
[13:35.77]The Germa... Yeah, there's a river.
[13:37.25]I don't know where it is, but...
[13:45.36]Thank you so much for 50 bucks, man.
[13:47.96]I want to see this.
[13:50.70]Hold on, pause it.
[13:51.92]That's a pretty good screenshot.
[13:54.97]You guys are editing Wikipedia pages now?
[13:59.13]The Jerma or Irma is a river in southeastern Serbia, notable for passing the Serbian Bulgarian border twice.
[14:10.05]Serbia, Bulgaria, returning to Serbia.
[14:12.00]The Germa continues to flow generally to the north, passing next to the village of Iskrobasi and the picturesque spa of Banja.
[14:19.40]Hydroelectricity.
[14:21.00]Hydroelectric plant Italics has been constructed as of August 13th, 2017.
[14:24.98]The hydroelectric plant offers power to the Truro area.
[14:28.42]Why would somebody make that?
[14:32.69]You guys do understand.
[14:33.79]I'm going to be completely real with you here.
[14:38.52]I bet you only 11 people a year search for the Jerma River in Serbia.
[14:44.08]And you know what?
[14:46.22]Eight of them have probably been you guys.
[14:49.42]Somebody is going to go look at that for a school project.
[14:51.93]One person.
[14:53.67]And they're going to write that down.
[15:00.27]Who is coming to this page?
[15:02.71]Why would you ever come to this page for any reason?
[15:07.11]It doesn't serve a purpose.
[15:12.02]The first sentences, even though it is compact.
[15:15.48]Of course it does.
[15:16.22]You just ruined a Serbian kid's school project.
[15:26.92]Oh well.
[15:32.75]No, you know what?
[15:34.65]Fuck it, they'll probably build it.
[15:36.69]Somebody in Serbia will probably look at that Wikipedia article and be like... What?
[15:40.90]Huh?
[15:44.14]That is supposed to be... ...Italic's power plant here?
[15:51.28]Oh shit!
[15:52.84]Build it!
[15:57.02]I can't Russian... It's hard to do a Russian accent!
[16:10.72]That's Russia.
[16:11.44]Serbia is like right next to Russia, right?
[16:16.40]I mean it.
[16:18.90]Wait, hold on.
[16:19.44]Wait, wait, wait.
[16:20.58]Where is... Serbia is not... Wait, hold on.
[16:23.57]Serbia.
[16:26.13]It's right there.
[16:30.01]That's not Russia at all.
[16:32.68]I thought it was in Russia.
[16:33.86]I thought it was like a Russian thing.
[16:36.17]That's wrong.
[16:37.17]That's wrong.
[16:38.61]I thought Serbia was like in Russia.
[16:43.31]What the fuck am I thinking of?
[16:54.54]What am I thinking of here?
[17:01.29]Siberia.
[17:02.43]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[17:06.63]I thought like Siber- Siberia, Serbia.
[17:12.57]It was the same- my brain connected the two.
[17:16.29]Oh well.
[17:24.75]Siberia.
[17:30.21]127 IQ.
[17:30.55]Go play GeoGuessr again.
[17:31.57]Serbia.
[17:32.05]Zyberia.
[17:54.68]Smarter than 6% of people.
[17:56.14]Look, geographic location does not have anything to do with intelligence.
[18:05.73]Yeah, guess what?
[18:06.55]Einstein.
[18:07.57]Einstein didn't even know what the fuck he was talking about.
[18:09.53]He, like, did one math problem correct.
[18:12.47]In fact, most of Einstein's problems, he fucked them up, and that's why they happen.
[18:19.32]He fucked up all his algorithms, and people saw his mistakes, and they corrected them decades later.
[18:35.64]It's actually cottage.
[18:36.44]It is true.
[18:38.18]It's true.
[18:38.72]I may have had a few beers.
[18:48.77]I'm trying to, like, sit at the fire.
[18:51.51]Oh, wait, somebody updated the page.
[18:54.39]Are you serious?
[18:54.95]I'm afraid.
[18:55.29]Let's see what it says.
[19:00.67]Oh, my fucking god.
[19:09.56]Serbia.
[19:10.46]The German originates in the... How about reading this?
[19:17.93]I'm especially glad somebody wrote that You missed one syllable and all of a sudden you're gonna get like hung out to dry I
[19:46.05]Alright, it's time to leave.
[19:52.91]But the party?
[19:54.85]I already went to the party.
[19:57.91]I went to the party already.
[20:00.01]Fine, I'll dance.
[20:01.50]Can I dance over here?
[20:19.00]Do you just stand in the corner and drink at parties?
[20:24.90]No.
[20:29.08]You miss a fucking syllable and all of a sudden you're geographically incorrect.
[20:32.42]Take a crack.
[20:39.03]Everyone dance.
[20:40.55]What's going on in here?
[20:43.97]Now I'm just being annoying.
[20:48.02]You missed a couple of syllables.
[20:54.62]These are very similar words.
[20:56.44]If I had looked at a map, I would have known.
[20:58.24]I was never good at geography.
[21:07.73]Let's go.
[21:09.70]Look, the horse is having a party too!
[21:13.72]Alright, let me go this way.
[21:25.57]Should I go to bed?
[21:33.13]No, I want to ride to the camp.
[21:36.59]Make sure you clear up after everyone.
[21:40.74]Stargazer?
[21:42.78]You missed a couple of frames, now you're moving to L.A.
[21:45.00]I need to stop paying attention.
[21:49.81]I am so embarrassed.
[21:52.21]If my webcam was on, I would have been red in my face.
[22:03.22]Okay, now I gotta like I gotta get my mind off like Siberia This is suburbia.
[22:09.33]Yeah, it was in suburbia.
[22:10.59]Anyways guys, I was doing a suburban geese suburban Siberian

[22:31.03]The suburban river in Siberia.

[25:00.03]It's notable for passing the Serbian-Bulgarian border twice and losing to Pinwheel on stream.
[25:20.15]Cut it out.
[25:24.52]God damn it.
[25:25.38]Okay.
[25:34.28]Hi, John.
[25:35.22]It's been 20 minutes.
[25:36.89]It's time to play the game now.
[25:38.89]Oh, you won't.
[25:40.40]Uncle told me something about a train.
[25:43.32]What did he say?
[25:45.18]Mary Beth overheard something about a train for a wealthy folk rowing down through Scarlet Meadows just south of the state border.
[25:51.32]Yes.
[25:51.76]I'm so glad I wasn't on stage for that one.
[25:53.69]I ain't even sure.
[25:54.47]Imagine being on stage.
[25:55.71]Come on.
[25:56.41]At night, not too guarded.
[25:57.95]It's perfect.
[25:59.03]I ain't talking through.
[26:04.82]What if we could force a train stop We get a wagon full of some flammable oil Put it on the tracks.
[26:14.60]They see it.
[26:15.71]They know they either have to stop or die Ain't no train driver wants to be cooked alive.
[26:20.43]I
[26:22.82]That is kind of brilliant.
[26:26.30]I gotta pay attention to the story.
[26:28.44]I gotta get like a fucking celery stalk and chew on it.
[26:31.25]I think that's the first time you ever had one of them.
[26:34.51]Shut up.
[26:35.35]You might be the first bastard to ever have half his brains eaten by a wolf and end up more intelligent.
[26:42.96]So we're doing it?
[26:43.58]Yeah, we're gonna need ammunition, guns, look real frightening, and some dynamite to open up the train.
[26:50.72]I'll get the supplies.
[26:52.14]Gotta head into town for Abigail anyway.
[26:54.40]Don't even ask.
[26:56.21]You go find us an oil wagon.
[26:57.79]Yeah, I know just the place.
[26:58.99]They're always heading into that refinery.
[27:01.55]There's an old run-down shack just over the border, north of a place called Dewberry Creek.
[27:06.43]Leave it hidden somewhere near there.
[27:25.17]You miss a few syllables.
[27:31.90]No, you guys are elephants.
[27:34.12]You'll never forget.
[27:36.16]Let me do a chore.
[27:36.94]Move on.
[27:38.36]Let it go.
[27:41.15]I can't let it go.
[27:41.87]You actually do have to do this.
[28:02.97]I lost it.
[28:03.43]I did.
[28:03.75]I did lose it.
[28:17.36]One swing.
[28:17.76]Yeah, you do this so the gang members all end up liking you more.
[28:23.44]You get more friends this way.
[28:24.43]You get more reputation this way.
[28:26.17]Ooh, embarrassing.
[28:29.75]Riveting gameplay.
[28:30.57]I'm going.
[28:31.07]I just needed to do this first.
[28:32.11]Wait, you have to do this?
[28:36.19]Yeah.
[28:39.87]If you want everyone to respect you in the camp.
[28:44.14]It just gives you camp points.
[28:56.32]Red Dead 2's not a game, it's a lifestyle.
[28:57.92]See?
[28:58.20]Look at that.
[28:58.56]Plus.
[28:59.18]Plus.
[29:00.70]See?
[29:02.20]There's other things you can do too, I think, as well.
[29:03.88]Alright, let's, um... So, let's... We got the wagon thing to deal with here.
[29:10.22]So, we got... Micah's now available again.
[29:14.19]Meet him at the camp at Strawberry Aura.
[29:15.59]I mean, we could do this.
[29:18.47]Oil wagon is over here.
[29:22.15]Let's go over here.
[29:28.40]Okay, so.
[29:30.14]Let's just head out.
[29:32.14]That was just the intro, guys.
[29:34.23]So, now the intro is over.
[29:38.73]Welcome to the stream.
[29:39.37]Hey, everybody.
[29:42.11]Alright.
[29:50.68]So.
[29:52.76]That's not my horse.
[29:53.54]My horse is over here.
[29:58.68]Let's go.
[30:01.51]New haircut?
[30:01.99]No, we'll do that later.
[30:03.45]Later, later, later, later.
[30:05.05]Okay, so here we are.
[30:08.67]Welcome to the stream.
[30:09.67]Thanks, everybody, for joining us.
[30:13.57]Have I played the Undertale thing yet?
[30:20.88]No.
[30:22.66]I have not.
[30:24.38]I did play the first Undertale.
[30:25.52]I streamed that.
[30:26.22]Uh-oh.
[30:27.30]What's going on over here?
[30:33.51]Gunshots over here.
[30:34.27]What was it?
[30:35.17]Ooh!
[30:35.35]I think so.
[30:35.94]I can be.
[30:36.34]Except for five dollars.
[30:38.08]Let's do it.
[30:39.24]What does he want me to do?
[31:03.68]Look, man, rules are simple, okay?
[31:05.49]Whoever shoots one of these bottles, wins.
[31:07.57]Just draw your gun and aim when you're ready, alright?
[31:10.55]Draw your gun and aim.
[31:12.58]Okay.
[31:15.30]Shoot!
[31:30.51]Shit!
[31:30.95]Come on now, really?
[31:31.73]Got it.
[31:32.47]Thanks for the five bucks, dude.
[31:35.97]You can raise the stakes.
[31:39.47]Let me make sure my gun is... Hold on, raise the stakes?
[31:44.43]Ten bucks, fine.
[31:45.21]Is this reloaded?
[31:46.53]Okay.
[31:46.63]How are you gonna put him back up?
[31:58.79]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[31:59.37]Where are they?
[32:01.03]Four birds out of the sky?
[32:02.19]What?
[32:03.03]Birds!
[32:03.37]Why am I using this gun?
[32:27.62]What the fu- I- I got- You can't Deadeye.
[32:30.70]I thought- I thought I wasn't allowed to Deadeye here.
[32:37.47]So, was I allowed to Deadeye there, but not on the bottles?
[32:45.34]You can just- You just can't- Oh, whatever.
[32:50.54]No, I lost.
[32:51.96]I lost fair and square.
[32:52.90]I was trying to press R1 on it, but I don't have that yet.
[32:57.96]I didn't even have a fucking rifle.
[33:01.11]Hold on.
[33:01.45]Would that have actually worked, though?
[33:23.64]Yeah, it would have.
[33:24.56]Damn it.
[33:25.26]Damn it!
[33:25.76]I just, I didn't work the first time.
[33:27.34]I figured it was not allowed in the second time or something.
[33:34.18]No, I lost fair and square.
[33:35.02]I'm not gonna kill that guy.
[33:40.07]No, just come over here, horse.
[33:51.95]Um, careful.
[33:56.98]Alright, you're good.
[34:01.08]You were both shooting towards the horse.
[34:05.60]Did you know that bottles were living creatures?
[34:07.66]Yeah, but I tried to press R1 on them, but I... I don't have that unlocked yet, apparently, or something.
[34:13.16]I just thought that... I would assume that if that was... it would be not available, or he'd be like, You're cheating!
[34:17.70]That's what happens in every video game.
[34:21.88]If you use the thing that auto-targets and kills everything, usually they'll go, Hey, wait a minute!
[34:40.02]I detect you're using a gameplay mechanic.
[34:42.67]Hey, wait, you have magic powers?
[34:52.47]Did you braid your horse's tail?
[34:56.01]Yes.
[34:58.31]Why are we speaking like it's some kind of problem?
[35:00.58]Do people have a problem with the braided tail that I gave the horse?
[35:04.62]Is that an issue?
[35:08.52]Why did I do it?
[35:10.30]So I know which horse is mine.
[35:12.66]And it's gold, too.
[35:21.40]I gotta sneak in here.
[35:28.15]I'm going, I'm going.
[35:29.05]Leave me alone.
[35:33.39]Those are loud noises.
[35:39.35]It's creepy.
[35:40.39]It's... I'm not even going to read that.
[35:42.23]I'm not... Alright, give me my fucking gun.
[35:47.99]I'm going to eat some corn, though.
[35:50.79]This looks like pretty ripe corn to me.
[35:55.08]The corn kernels are pretty ripe this time of year.
[35:59.20]Alright, first of all, give me my weapon.
[36:01.02]Because I could just do this.
[36:03.70]Yeah, I'll check this out.
[36:05.68]Give me my springfield rifle.
[36:08.59]Make sure I have everything I need.
[36:12.39]How many brains have I blown out so far?
[36:14.69]Zero.
[36:15.04]Alright, so here we go.
[36:17.12]So what do we got?
[36:18.78]We got... A couple people... They're guarding every entrance, so... The question is... So what do I have to do to these?
[36:33.90]Do I have to steal one?
[36:37.12]I was in the middle of having a fucking mental breakdown when that cutscene was going on.
[36:42.94]I wonder if I can just hop the fucking fence and get on immediately.
[36:52.47]Or if I should go back and snipe.
[36:56.01]It's right there, but do I need to steal it or destroy it?
[37:03.80]I think I'm just going to climb over and grab it and just sprint up.
[37:09.46]I mean, this guy will save me.
[37:10.38]Is the guy on a route?
[37:11.50]Okay, that guy's on a route, that guy's on a route.
[37:14.45]Opportunity, right now.
[37:17.95]Opportunity, right now.
[37:19.09]Opportunity.
[37:23.05]I missed your opportunity, and I'm knocking.
[37:29.16]Okay.
[37:31.38]Okay, oil.
[37:34.26]I'm leaking oil.
[37:41.98]Go, go, go, go!
[37:44.10]Go, go!
[37:44.86]I just... I'm gonna lose all the oil.
[37:48.02]Hurry!
[37:50.62]Not a drop, right?
[37:52.06]What if they just light a match and drop it?
[37:54.11]It's gonna go the whole way.
[38:01.69]Will that happen?
[38:05.58]This is just an environmental disaster in the making.
[38:09.20]No.
[38:12.38]As long as I get there with two cups of oil, that's all we need, right?
[38:19.09]I just need, like, one cup of oil.
[38:21.83]Oh, shit.
[38:22.79]Oh, shit.
[38:23.89]Don't do it.
[38:24.27]Don't do it.
[38:24.77]No, you don't.
[38:33.54]Go.
[38:33.82]Go.
[38:37.58]There's so many holes in this.
[38:39.80]Are you seriously still alive?
[38:45.66]Die!
[38:47.22]Oh my god, this guy's a bullet sponge!
[38:53.37]Oh shit!
[38:54.55]Go!
[38:55.09]Keep going!
[38:56.31]Where is this guy?
[39:14.67]Use the road?
[39:15.25]I mean, I... I can't.
[39:23.21]Shoot the oil.
[39:24.37]Oh, fuck!
[39:27.23]No!
[39:28.45]No, no!
[39:29.71]No, no!
[39:30.33]Get up, get up, get up, get up.
[39:32.46]No, you're both fine.
[39:34.26]Everyone's fine.
[39:35.00]I just need to back up and still... Oh my god, what happened?
[39:38.36]I'm stuck in the tree.
[39:40.62]Oh!
[39:55.65]Fresh oil tank, we're fine.
[39:59.45]Why is this not on the map right now?
[40:02.11]Give me the reason why.
[40:03.97]This is not on the... No GPS here.
[40:07.40]There's only one horse now.
[40:19.80]Is the mask on?
[40:20.44]Yeah, I got it on.
[40:28.88]GPS in the 1800s.
[40:32.74]We're doing like an Assassin's Creed simulation.
[40:41.11]That was close.
[40:42.07]Let's do it again.
[40:44.05]Okay.
[40:49.28]That was really close.
[40:55.27]Alright, do we need another one?
[41:05.10]Tell John back at camp that the wagon is in position.
[41:08.32]I will do that.
[41:19.17]I just saved that.
[41:19.87]But I didn't do exactly what I just did there.
[41:22.39]I don't have it on me.
[41:27.37]Never mind.
[41:29.15]Hey, come on, boys.
[41:32.47]Wait, hold on.
[41:34.99]I can... Where'd he go?
[41:39.99]Right there.
[41:40.31]Okay.
[41:40.41]Okay.
[42:15.34]I'm trying to get meat!
[42:16.56]Why is everybody freaking out about this?
[42:24.03]Yeah, I know you... I know, but I just wanted... I just wanted the meat.
[42:32.19]Perfect caliber for deer hunting.
[42:36.59]Why do I look like Nathan Drake?
[42:38.21]I just... I changed the pajamas.
[42:42.84]I used to enjoy watching you, Jeremy, but you've become way too violent lately.
[42:49.39]This is the old west, man.
[42:50.77]We're not playing like a Sesame Street sim.
[43:12.80]I took the meat.
[43:14.36]I just wanted the meat you kept for skinning it.
[43:19.76]Wait, this is a sesame?
[43:21.72]Alright, where the fuck is my horse?
[43:28.21]Why is the horse this far away right now?
[43:30.09]Do I have to walk all the way back here?
[43:31.79]How far away are you?
[43:47.30]Okay, well, it's time to get on a new one.
[43:50.63]I'm gonna take a taxi.
[44:02.49]Which one do I want?
[44:06.47]What's that one?
[44:08.35]Okay, come here.
[44:15.14]Not a bad horse.
[44:16.06]What's this one?
[44:18.66]Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[44:27.12]Just, will one of you taxis pull the fuck over?

[45:11.13]What the fuck are you?!
[45:13.55]Hey!
[45:24.55]Fuck you!
[45:25.03]No, stop it!
[45:39.06]Calm down.
[45:39.56]That was so not alright.
[45:46.42]Why did that happen?
[45:47.10]Easy now.
[45:52.80]Look, I'm staying right here.
[45:53.88]Just calm down.
[45:56.92]See?
[45:57.98]I'm not a threat.
[45:59.56]I just need you to drive me to go 200 fucking yards that way.
[46:04.02]See?
[46:05.06]You're fine.
[46:07.66]Relax.
[46:11.30]See?
[46:21.00]You're okay.
[46:28.92]Hey, hey, hey.
[46:30.18]Don't worry.
[46:42.47]I just need you to take me to over there.
[46:44.49]That's all we need you to do.
[46:45.21]Go together.
[46:47.99]Look, you and I might even become really good friends after this, because we're both just two people out in the middle of nowhere.
[46:53.32]Whoa, whoa!
[46:55.02]Easy!
[47:05.21]Everything's fine.
[47:07.70]You letting me get on you?

[47:40.95]Alright.
[47:43.01]Now take me to my car, please.
[47:49.57]Let's go.
[47:51.00]I'll pay the toll, right?
[47:52.52]This is like the horse toll.
[47:54.74]Slow it up.
[47:56.26]This is what you pay the guy at the taxi.
[47:57.98]Here's an apple.
[48:01.16]There's your payment.
[48:02.68]Okay.
[48:03.52]Let's go.
[48:15.84]I kind of like this horse, though.
[48:16.99]I don't know if I want to get rid of him.
[48:23.97]What is it?
[48:24.85]What is it?
[48:25.93]There's a predator over here.
[48:28.95]What predator is over here?
[48:38.79]Oh, it's a snake.
[48:39.57]Alright, we'll fuck it.
[48:45.45]My horse... Is my horse inside of the oil refinery?
[48:50.82]Where are you?
[48:51.44]Why are you in there?
[48:54.72]I can't go in there.
[48:55.50]Alright, he's coming.
[49:03.43]Where is he?
[49:41.59]We got a car accident.

[50:14.10]I got the thing.
[50:14.76]I gotta go talk to John.
[50:16.84]But I need a stable first.
[50:19.91]Is there a stable on the way here?
[50:21.05]There's one here.
[50:23.45]I could go this way and then down.
[50:26.79]Yeah, I'm gonna... Let's go to the stable.
[50:32.51]Wait a minute.
[50:32.83]I could use, like, tricks here?
[50:36.68]Oh, this could be fun.
[50:39.79]Who wants me to go that way?
[50:43.47]Did I jump from horse to horse?
[50:47.73]Hello, auto.
[50:57.54]So they don't recognize me because I have a bandana?
[51:06.38]Yeah, I am still wearing the mask.
[51:07.70]I probably should take it off.
[51:19.65]Damn.
[51:25.19]Girl.
[51:29.38]Easy, girl.
[51:30.22]You're okay.
[51:33.40]So, I can't... Look, the GPS has a line going up here.

[51:55.53]Pay the damaging fee?
[51:57.77]Please don't run into me.

[53:41.53]Actually, you know, let me just search these people.
[53:43.69]Why not, right?
[53:47.85]It's a bunch of old driscolls.
[53:50.52]You can move the saddle.
[53:51.30]Yeah, I know.
[53:51.98]There's probably something in here.
[54:01.53]Yeah, there's like a chest back there.
[54:03.67]Nice, nice, nice.
[54:05.51]Show auto.
[54:06.05]I will in a second.
[54:06.57]Because I'm going to have to take him down the stairs in just a moment.
[54:13.41]Saddle bags.

[55:09.66]I'll show him.
[55:10.52]And then I'm gonna take him downstairs.
[55:11.55]I'm not sure what he needs.
[55:13.25]He was just out and he ate.
[55:14.15]So, I don't know what his deal is.
[55:17.65]Five dollars on that guy.
[55:19.51]Alright, here we go.
[55:21.39]I'll show Otto.
[55:25.20]Otto?
[55:26.16]Hi, by the way.
[55:27.38]Hey.
[55:28.54]Come here.
[55:30.16]People actually will be able to see you now because there's light in the room.
[55:32.24]Come here.
[55:33.78]Okay.
[55:33.92]Come here.
[55:36.68]Come here, come here, come here.
[55:38.38]Oh, big dog.
[55:41.27]There he is.
[55:41.57]There's the Otto.
[55:43.45]Hey, there's the Creeper.
[55:48.49]All right.
[55:52.81]I will be right back.
[55:53.79]I don't know.
[55:54.50]He might need to go outside or something.
[55:55.96]Give me two seconds.
[55:56.46]I'll be right back.
[58:58.42]I don't know what his deal was.
[58:59.94]He just kind of wanted to go outside.
[59:03.90]But then he ran back in.
[59:04.68]I think he's just bored.
[59:08.18]He's down there now.
[59:11.02]Okay.
[59:14.44]Back at it.
[59:19.00]He wanted us to see him.
[59:23.32]So let's get going.
[59:24.99]What the hell was I doing?
[59:28.93]Oh yeah, I was going to the statement.
[59:33.73]Have I ever ridden a horse?
[59:35.40]Yes.
[59:39.54]I have ridden on a pony when I was probably like eight years old or seven years old.
[59:55.57]Same.
[59:55.81]I think most people have ridden a pony.
[60:02.03]No, I don't think it was a pony.
[60:03.09]I think it was an actual horse.
[60:04.91]It was one of those local town fairs where the horse just walks around in a circle while some guy holds on leading it the entire time.
[60:34.14]It wasn't still following me.
[60:35.32]I thought it was still following me.
[60:43.22]German is dumb and can't distinguish Serbia and Siberia.
[60:46.10]126 IQ.
[60:46.42]That's real?
[60:47.00]I get you the papers for it.
[60:48.92]Easy.
[60:49.14]Whoa.
[60:59.55]He added an extra syllable and it fucking freaked me out.
[61:01.94]I already told you guys this.
[61:05.52]My performance IQ was like 60.
[61:07.92]It was horrible.
[61:18.02]I have like 127 IQ, but my performance IQ is like... I barely am a functioning human.
[61:28.26]Haven't we talked about that already?
[61:41.90]It's not that I can't distinguish Serbia and Siberia, it's the fact that my brain decided... My brain decided that Siberia was what the thing was being said was.
[61:53.53]What's going on here?
[61:54.95]There's a flame right there.
[61:59.55]What's wrong?
[62:03.37]I can't make heads or tails of where I'm at.
[62:09.23]I live in front of the saloon, next to the freight station.
[62:15.11]You know if I'm heading in the right direction?
[62:18.71]Uh, sure.
[62:19.69]Just head over that way.
[62:22.63]You'll be home in no time.
[62:30.54]well thank you mister am I glad I asked you're going the wrong way man I got my gun on me relax
[63:01.00]Hey, what?
[63:04.32]This is not actually his house.
[63:05.82]Where is he going?
[63:07.99]Here we are.
[63:11.41]Home sweet home.
[63:16.01]Must be it.
[63:18.49]Looks kind of different.
[63:21.17]He's going to get kicked by the horse.
[63:22.25]Oh, well.
[63:23.41]There she is.
[63:27.30]My beautiful wife.
[63:41.17]Did I get it?
[63:42.91]That was like the social club.
[63:56.70]Got it.
[64:05.37]I didn't kill him.
[64:14.69]Oh, it's the picture of Black Bell.
[64:17.29]I don't know, what was I taking a picture of here?
[64:24.27]Oh, it's the guy with the gold prospector.
[64:27.63]Okay.
[64:30.87]Well... Wait, hold on a second.
[64:34.02]When I'm allowed to take a picture... I'm not going to get in trouble for literally telling a guy a lie, right?
[64:46.32]I'm not under oath.
[64:54.68]Oh, I lost honor.
[64:55.61]Okay.
[64:58.47]So, now I got the horses.
[65:00.73]Give me this one.
[65:05.11]Let's see what you're, let's see what you're worth.
[65:08.01]Easy, easy, easy.
[65:08.89]It's alright.
[65:09.41]Relax.
[65:14.52]Are they closed?
[65:15.18]Are you guys closed right now?
[65:17.80]I think they're closed.
[65:20.26]Are you closed?
[65:22.24]Yes, you are.
[65:30.33]Well, that sucks.
[65:31.61]You have to do the hunting.
[65:36.73]I already did the hunting mission on the first stream.
[65:39.73]I got access to the stables.
[65:40.69]I have access to the fence as well.
[65:42.83]I did that off stream.
[65:45.49]Sell horse to butcher.
[65:47.79]Um, I don't think I'm going to.
[65:48.99]I'm going to hitch this horse here.
[65:52.98]Alright, so hold on.
[65:53.88]If I hitch this horse, will it still be out here?
[65:57.60]No, actually I can't because I need a saddle.
[65:59.62]Check the horse's stats.
[66:00.48]Tennessee Walker.
[66:01.64]This horse is terrible, actually.
[66:15.19]This is the worst horse that I think I may have sat on.
[66:18.65]Let's get out of here.
[66:22.41]You'll be free.
[66:23.05]I said be free, dammit!
[66:27.23]Just be free!
[66:51.18]See?
[66:52.24]That's the kind of life you're supposed to live.
[67:03.46]Go on now.
[67:04.54]Get out of here.
[67:10.23]I'll always love you.
[67:26.72]The horse is happier without you.
[67:28.13]He actually kind of doesn't really know what to do.
[67:32.63]Is he going?
[67:34.27]He doesn't know what to do.
[67:35.01]He's so confused.
[67:35.87]He doesn't know what to do in the wild.
[67:37.03]Hold on.
[67:43.18]Wait, wait.
[67:43.50]Come back home.
[67:44.14]Come back home.
[67:44.58]You don't know what to do.
[67:47.96]I fed you like three cakes and now all of a sudden you're domesticated.
[67:51.48]Come back here.
[67:51.92]Come back to me.
[67:53.83]That was wrong.
[67:54.37]That was wrong.
[67:56.11]Come back home.
[68:09.83]I need the... I need the... stables to be open.
[68:16.92]I'm gonna get you a good home.
[68:28.39]Okay, I need to hitch this horse.
[68:31.71]What?
[68:36.08]Hey!
[68:36.94]Hey!
[68:37.80]Law!
[68:38.50]Police!
[68:39.72]Police!
[68:40.62]No, my horse!
[68:45.97]I don't care about you, man.
[68:48.29]Come back here.
[68:48.77]Come back to Dad.
[68:50.16]Come back to Dad.
[68:53.64]Come back to Dad.
[69:06.44]Come here.
[69:08.00]Come here, come here, hide down!
[69:08.92]Oh no, no!
[69:13.68]Okay.
[69:16.38]Can the fucking stable open?
[69:24.09]I need to make like a campfire here and just wait till morning.
[69:29.47]Okay, we're all here.
[69:30.49]I can only do this in the wilderness.
[69:39.58]The stables aren't even... Go to another stable?
[69:41.14]We're already here.
[69:41.94]8.17 PM.
[69:45.28]I gotta just... Let's just go to the... Let's go... Let's rest at the inn.
[69:48.74]Will the horse still be there, though?
[69:49.84]I feel like I'm just gonna go 50 feet away from camp.
[69:58.43]This is the wilderness over here, right?
[69:59.69]This is what Bear Grylls does.
[70:00.89]He goes, like, 30 feet off the highway.
[70:21.98]He saw the video.
[70:25.24]Alright, I actually haven't done this in a little while.
[70:26.58]Let me check it.
[70:30.08]Uh, stringy meat and plain medicine.
[70:31.65]Yeah, I'm gonna just cook.
[70:33.85]Let's cook.
[70:44.66]I need some Deadeye.
[70:48.32]Watch out, the grass is gonna catch on fire!
[70:52.20]Feed horse to the other horse.
[70:56.64]Um, no.
[71:03.74]Bonfire lit.
[71:09.68]Why am I... What are you talking about?
[71:12.63]What?
[71:13.91]What does that even mean?
[71:25.65]I'll eat this one.
[71:29.21]Do I have any more?
[71:29.73]No.
[71:31.47]I'm gonna eat these ones too.
[71:41.16]Fill up my cores.
[71:44.78]One more.
[71:52.08]When am I gonna play the Monster Hunter on the Switch?
[71:56.14]Um, probably won't.
[71:57.90]That's a big commitment.
[72:02.26]Okay, we're good.
[72:03.32]So now, sleep.
[72:05.18]Sleep until morning.
[72:06.99]Should I set up a tent?
[72:09.25]Should I?
[72:09.55]No, fuck it. ...
[72:29.65]Alright.
[72:31.77]To the stables we go.
[72:32.95]It's on Xbox?
[72:40.89]This is PS4, though.
[72:41.55]Is that what you were talking about?
[72:44.09]Alright, I have two hours to kill.
[72:49.71]And we've got some bounty hunters.
[72:51.73]Good thing I just opened the map for no reason.
[72:59.28]Where are they coming from?
[73:06.54]That's on the other horse.
[73:08.24]Stay right there.
[73:10.20]Daddy's got work to do.
[73:12.82]Where they at?
[73:49.58]I got a good drop on these guys.
[74:30.72]Good.
[74:33.22]Let's go.
[74:36.50]Aiming it with this, like... Like, that's so slow, though.
[74:40.70]Like, for real.
[74:44.28]It's like... It's like I'm sitting in a fucking pond of sludge.
[74:53.49]I'm so good at shooting off their hats.
[74:58.60]Alright, let's go.
[74:59.53]Don't stay- don't leave behind, c'mon.
[75:01.63]We'll get places to be.
[75:03.23]Uh, a pond of slunge.
[75:11.13]Sludge.
[75:16.66]Setting change?
[75:17.78]Uh, yeah, that would- that would be bad all around.
[75:26.76]What did you think I said?
[75:32.01]Okay, here we go.
[75:35.43]A condom of slug?
[75:42.13]Why would I say that?
[75:44.16]What the heck?
[75:46.92]Who the heck are you?
[75:52.20]Why do I have two horses still?
[75:53.32]Because I'm desperately trying to get this one put in the stable.
[75:58.25]But they closed.
[75:59.05]And then I got attacked by bounty hunters.
[76:08.49]No, it's all good.
[76:17.52]Jesus.
[76:18.02]Let's go!
[76:18.32]How much are you worth?
[76:22.26]Two dollars and forty cents.
[76:38.00]Okay, so this... That horse really is so terrible.
[76:47.09]It's just awful.
[76:49.93]You can have it.
[76:50.41]I mean, I knew it was bad, just in comparison to all the other ones.
[76:58.47]It's just the worst.
[77:08.94]This is my pre-order.
[77:13.16]Can I buy it and sell it back?
[77:17.47]This thing sucks, too.
[77:18.17]No, you can just keep this one.
[77:23.07]Uh, we'll take... Let's saddle up a horse back here.
[77:25.21]Okay.
[77:33.20]Let's go to John now.
[77:39.48]Sold him immediately?
[77:40.54]Well, they're gonna get him a better home.
[77:49.42]I could not provide a good home for that horse.
[77:52.08]He's turned into glue.
[77:56.27]That's a glue factor.
[78:05.61]They didn't have that shit back then.
[78:17.64]Pay off your bounty too?
[78:18.68]Yeah.
[78:20.38]I'll do that when I get to another town.
[78:23.63]This is a funny video.
[78:30.24]Hey, thanks!
[78:51.57]Brush horse, take back.
[78:52.86]Alright, the next body of wadi we're just going in.
[78:54.84]Is there a body of wadi over here?
[78:56.40]There is.
[78:57.96]Alright, let's go in that body of wadi.
[79:22.26]I'm just gonna dive in there.
[79:23.30]What's that?
[79:27.91]We got a random freak over here.
[79:29.47]Hello.
[79:30.83]Look at this, my friend.
[79:34.35]Tobacco.
[79:51.53]Tobacco.
[79:51.91]Hmm.
[79:51.99]Eat tobacco.
[80:29.45]I just don't understand this plant.
[80:32.99]It's expensive stuff.
[80:36.99]Craft items that replenish Deadeye.
[80:38.47]Use a campfire to craft with Indian tobacco.
[80:40.45]Okay.
[80:40.61]I think I'm gonna get a stomachache.
[80:45.11]Alright, come here, host.
[80:45.71]Let's go.
[80:51.55]You can be eaten to refill your Deadeye core or craft it into snake oil.
[80:57.69]Let's take a bath.
[81:03.09]How do I dive?
[81:03.73]Is this working?
[81:31.06]I did it, right?
[81:43.71]And press square.
[81:49.23]How do I dunk my head?
[81:50.00]Man, this forest needs to be cleaned, too.
[82:11.86]Okay.
[82:15.19]Go a little deeper.
[82:15.85]I don't think that's good enough, right?
[82:20.17]Nice and clean.
[82:27.24]Square while aiming to dive.
[82:29.24]I don't think I can.
[82:32.94]I'll dive and get my head on the ground.
[82:38.29]I'm clean enough.
[82:53.46]I'm clean enough.
[82:55.19]Let's go back to town.
[83:02.11]Dive into the waterfall.
[83:03.47]Oh, okay.
[83:04.91]It's gonna kill me.
[83:07.96]What's this?
[83:08.30]What is this, like, abandoned town?
[83:20.11]Aim gun and press square.
[83:22.92]Why would I need to have the gun out?
[83:26.40]Just go into an inn?
[83:27.18]Yeah, that's fine.
[83:32.43]This is weird.
[83:39.93]Any stuff in here?
[83:45.92]Provisions.
[83:46.92]Well, you're not gonna have a big provision sign and have nothing be in there.
[83:54.62]Or maybe not.
[84:03.25]Nothing in here.
[84:06.93]This is like a saloon.
[84:11.45]Check the saloon.
[84:15.87]There's upstairs here as well.
[84:19.57]Let's take a look upstairs.
[84:26.36]No, nothing in this Fortnite structure.
[84:27.88]What about that Fortnite structure?
[84:31.52]Just brand ankle, I'll be fine.
[84:48.49]Nothing?
[84:55.99]Focus on rat track.
[85:04.61]I just lost a thousand... Oh, fuck me.
[85:15.27]Oh, how are ya?
[85:17.71]Gold... Gold... Bar.
[85:23.43]Gold Special Horse Stimulant pamphlet.
[85:30.75]Oh, boy.
[85:33.13]What the fuck is this?
[85:41.20]Early settlers discovered that with... Special Horse Stimulant for your horse's general stamina.
[85:47.79]Special Horse Stimulant recipe.
[85:52.92]So what do I need?
[85:55.14]Sage, bulrush, wild carrot.
[85:59.72]Okay.
[86:04.25]Thanks for the fucking money.
[86:12.45]Hold on a second, let me... A large bar.
[86:22.71]Did I just, like, hit the jackpot right now?
[86:31.31]How much is that worth?
[86:36.32]Holy shit.
[86:37.54]Should I... Hold on.
[86:38.94]I'm looking at other stuff here.
[86:45.68]Oh, boy.
[86:46.08]There's somebody dead in here.
[86:51.54]I can sell that for 500 bucks.
[86:55.83]I don't want to, though.
[86:56.81]It's mine.
[86:57.23]This is kind of creepy.
[87:05.74]Is anything on these people?
[87:06.76]I don't think I can do anything with this.
[87:23.29]That's not... Wait, what?
[87:27.65]Okay, for a second... Imagine if I was locked in.
[87:33.11]Oh, that would be funny.
[87:36.95]Can this be opened?
[87:43.28]Well... Detail, as they say, right?
[87:47.68]It's kind of... This is crazy.
[87:53.46]He's not holding something, or... I guess not.
[88:00.69]Shoot the lock.
[88:06.59]This is not going to do anything.
[88:07.63]Shoot the lock.
[88:08.01]This is made out of solid steel.
[88:17.34]Dynamite.
[88:17.98]It's not going to do anything.
[88:19.02]I...
[88:22.36]I don't even have any dynamite left.
[88:23.58]I've panic-thrown all ten of my dynamites.
[88:29.41]You tried anyways?
[88:30.19]You never know.
[88:31.71]But that bar, though... Ooh.
[88:36.74]The game just auto-corrected me.
[88:37.86]I would've just drove right into that telephone pole.
[88:44.47]I gotta keep my eyes open for that shit, man.
[88:46.05]That stuff's everywhere.
[88:47.17]And I believe we're supposed to do treasure... Oh, I can't wait to do treasure hunting.
[88:49.59]We're gonna look for treasure on this stream and shit.
[88:53.25]Oh my god, it's gonna be so fun.
[89:02.04]Why am I stuck here?
[89:05.08]I need help here.
[89:05.70]I think I... Lenny!
[89:08.28]Okay, that was weird.
[89:11.02]I'm stuck inside of this.
[89:12.82]I did not even press those buttons.
[89:22.89]I know you can get up there.
[89:24.43]I'm certain of it.
[89:30.85]Okay.
[89:34.15]Good work.
[89:35.17]You're a good horse.
[89:43.08]What is going on over here, though?
[89:44.12]There's a new character?
[89:48.60]Rob a homestead.
[89:54.28]Is this what the home robbery tips are for?
[89:56.37]Hmm.
[89:59.77]Javier?
[90:07.82]I heard about a house.
[90:10.02]Could be interesting.
[90:10.80]What kind of a house?
[90:13.55]I don't know.
[90:15.06]A couple fellas I heard in town, they said it was really freakish.
[90:20.44]Freakish?
[90:21.10]Family local boogeyman, I guess.
[90:22.85]They're going into a haunted house?
[90:24.01]They're crooked in every way.
[90:26.65]So?
[90:27.31]Well, so these boys thought they were sitting on a lot of cash.
[90:30.37]They're highway robbers, kidnappers, apparently.
[90:33.25]They're well hidden in the woods.
[90:35.33]That sounds pretty dubious.
[90:37.11]Of course, it's dubious, but there ain't much risk of getting caught.
[90:43.48]okay then let's go take a look cool exactly just take a look it's up north on the other side of the river from valentine okay this way there is through cumberland falls though your horse is hitched nearby so is he coming with me
[91:09.37]Somebody said, why is Boogeyman 1-0 versus 2-0s?
[91:14.43]Yeah, I've had problems like that before with adding extra letters or something.
[91:20.19]Like an extra letter that you thought was there or that you got confused.
[91:24.72]An example of just randomly popped in my head, like Serbia, Siberia.
[91:28.52]That happens sometimes.

[93:13.25]Large house.
[93:13.91]Big house.

[100:39.89]And as a dad, you're like, God damn, that better not be my kid doing that.
[101:36.98]Alright, well... Oh, you're hitched.

[102:24.79]We have a couple more houses to look at here.
[102:26.65]What?
[102:28.80]I didn't take something off the chair?
[102:31.78]Moonshine.
[102:32.56]That's what I'm talking about.
[102:40.14]Cover scent.
[102:40.66]Lotion.

[102:58.85]Hold on.

[103:10.11]Are we desynced?
[103:23.44]Oh, hold on.
[103:26.91]My thing is freaking out.
[103:32.15]One moment, please.
[103:38.06]What the hell is going on?
[103:52.46]I'm going to call it there.
[103:54.12]I want to auto play a video.
[103:57.08]Stop it.
[104:06.28]Well, that's weird.
[104:18.11]Why can I not... What the fuck is going on?
[104:19.89]Tell me you have that bracelet on, will you?
[104:21.35]You like my silky...
[104:26.54]Well, I'm booted from Twitch for some reason.
[104:29.52]Am I still live?
[104:30.16]This is strange.
[104:32.20]Let me try a different browser.
[104:34.78]In Chipotle's kitchen, you won't find any... Stop autoplaying Twitch, for the love of God.
[104:43.99]I'm still live.
[104:45.15]That's weird.
[104:45.51]Let me open up... Let's try Microsoft Edge.
[104:59.38]Chipotle What Don't autoplay again, it's going to oh my god Oh
[105:28.56]I don't understand.
[105:30.76]Is Twitch, like, fucked up for anybody else?
[105:40.73]No?
[105:43.87]This is weird.
[105:46.35]Yeah, I can't even log into Twitch.
[105:53.90]Because I literally lost my dashboard.
[105:56.78]And now I can't even log into Twitch.
[106:05.40]I mean, I have the two-step shift, so I don't know why it would do that.
[106:14.36]What am I talking about?
[106:16.56]I just got booted from my dashboard.
[106:22.04]I don't know why.
[106:27.55]Can I do it from my phone?
[106:29.81]That's a good thing to try.
[106:37.51]This is too long of a joke.
[106:39.03]I'm not joking around.
[106:46.15]Yeah, I'm still on on my phone.
[106:52.91]Weird.
[106:53.85]Don't ask me why.
[106:59.88]Hold on.
[107:00.32]Let me just go to my settings and just see what's going on.
[107:13.26]Why the hell would it do that?
[107:23.32]Can I, like... Can I... Does anyone know if I can change my, like, password from, like, the Twitch mobile app?
[107:27.96]I'm not sure you can.
[107:32.99]This is strange.
[107:33.85]This is, like, freaking me out.
[107:38.91]You got logged out as well?
[107:40.91]So, wait.
[107:41.49]I shouldn't be, like, freaking out about this?
[107:48.33]I'll change it for you.
[107:59.94]Hold on.
[108:02.34]Sorry.
[108:06.05]Sorry, I'm kind of trying to figure out why the fuck this happened.
[108:09.73]Because I want to be able to see my dashboard.
[108:19.73]Oh shit.
[108:20.17]Password on screen.
[108:22.19]Can't log back in on browser.
[108:26.41]But mobile works.
[108:27.15]Okay.
[108:27.63]Alright.
[108:27.97]So this is not... I'm just freaking out for no reason.
[108:30.58]Okay.
[108:31.74]So there's just a problem with Twitch.
[108:34.36]Okay.
[108:35.66]Okay.
[108:36.02]Back to it.
[108:36.44]Sorry about that, guys.
[108:37.90]I can't really see anything else, though.
[108:43.70]Okay.
[108:44.36]We're good.
[108:44.64]Let me just come back here.
[108:50.45]Apology not accepted.
[108:51.81]That's just very odd.
[108:57.08]Why is your pa- What were we doing?
[109:01.42]Nice joke.
[109:02.04]No, I don't know, man.
[109:03.18]All of a sudden I look over and you've been logged out of Twitch.
[109:07.93]And I can't log back in?
[109:09.15]That's just like, just sound the fucking red alert panic alarms.
[109:14.21]You know what I mean?
[109:14.63]You gotta be careful.
[109:23.45]Sir, can I go under the bed?
[109:30.22]That was a bad joke.
[109:31.80]I'm not making any jokes.
[109:34.12]I was just scared that somebody, like, got my account.
[109:36.68]You know what I mean?
[109:38.90]Like, somebody may have got me.
[109:40.64]I was just trying to see if I got got.
[109:48.02]Oh, you're done for.
[109:51.52]Take the banjo?
[109:57.20]Anything else in here?
[109:59.32]I can't take any more cigarettes.
[110:00.80]No, I think that's it for this place.
[110:09.29]Unless I check over here.
[110:11.31]I've got so much money from their house in it already.
[110:13.01]Yeah, I'm going.
[110:26.08]Hello, Springer.
[110:28.28]The horse is still screaming, calm it down.
[110:32.44]Is it actually my kid, though?
[110:34.90]It is, isn't it?
[110:38.64]I'm gonna be so embarrassed when it is.
[110:47.24]Get over here.
[110:48.42]You're in big trouble.
[110:50.66]Returning to the old bad joke.
[110:54.83]What about the outhouse?
[111:05.49]Yeah, hold on.
[111:06.01]I can take my time here.
[111:06.79]There's still a whole... Oh, it's these people over here.
[111:09.37]Relax.
[111:12.83]Study.
[111:15.85]Ooh.
[111:18.51]That's not bad.
[111:21.76]That really is not bad at all.
[111:26.17]Oh, they need to be- here, look, I'm gonna- What's that?
[111:36.31]What is going on over there?
[111:37.65]Oh, wait, hold on.
[111:38.63]This horse is just being free?
[111:43.44]I sent this horse away a long time ago.
[111:45.80]It's still here?
[111:46.52]With the dead lady?
[111:52.10]Okay.
[111:54.84]Come on, get out of here!
[112:11.33]Oh, there you are.
[112:11.91]At least that horse is gonna have food for a while.
[112:21.83]Alright, we got stuff.
[112:23.01]Medical box.
[112:27.37]Health cure.
[112:28.07]I can't even take it.
[112:29.29]Can I... Let me just take one.
[112:31.89]Potent health cure.
[112:32.75]Do I have just a regular health cure?
[112:34.23]Yeah, just take it.
[112:34.83]Just give me that one.
[112:41.34]Meat-eating horse.
[112:44.56]Guys, you give it a couple of days.
[112:48.36]That horse will be a carnivore real quick.
[112:53.96]Let me tell you.
[112:57.25]From my own personal research on the matter.
[113:02.49]Doesn't take very long, I'll tell you.
[113:15.00]Well, look down here.
[113:15.82]I can't carry any more.
[113:22.22]All you got is clothes in here?
[113:24.32]There's no secret weapons?
[113:27.62]Apparently not in the wardrobe.
[113:34.12]Fireplace, no.
[113:37.64]No cigarettes.
[113:41.88]There's a cabinet.
[113:43.84]Get the hat, get the hat, get the hat, hat, hat.
[113:45.49]Okay.
[113:55.23]Premium cigarettes.
[113:55.91]These people smoked a lot.
[113:58.58]Kentucky Bourbon.
[114:03.56]Okay.
[114:04.62]Couple more rooms here.
[114:09.80]That's when I just came in this one.
[114:13.43]Here.
[114:14.23]Wait, what's that?
[114:15.21]A satchel?
[114:15.89]No.
[114:21.57]There's a chest up there.
[114:28.78]Why do I hear a time bomb?
[114:32.00]Oh, it's that on the counter.
[114:33.62]Okay.
[114:33.78]It's like a self-destruct button in here.
[114:39.79]Run?
[114:40.19]You cannot run while inside a house like this.
[114:43.43]Let's see.
[114:44.65]You just walk.
[114:47.01]But, there's a chest up here.
[114:51.97]Rum?
[114:52.30]And that's it, huh?
[115:00.29]He actually did spend 40... Well, dang... Well, I spent probably 20 minutes here.
[115:04.55]10 minutes panicking about my Twitch being logged out.
[115:09.65]And then... What's that?
[115:15.33]Only one more room.
[115:16.57]Guys, I told you I was going to take my time.
[115:19.89]I told you it was going to happen.
[115:25.48]Last room.
[115:27.70]All made.
[115:32.95]Fifteen minutes was me getting hacked by Chipotle.
[115:35.15]I know, right?
[115:39.92]Nothing in here.
[115:41.20]Got those cigarettes?
[115:42.00]I already have a full pack of cigarettes.
[115:43.74]I can't take them.
[115:49.09]Take the cigarettes for the cards?
[115:50.81]I think those are just regular cigarettes, aren't they?
[115:53.73]Cigarettes have cards in them.
[116:04.22]Well, that's a weapon case.
[116:09.90]What is that?
[116:12.58]Ooh.
[116:14.20]Shotgun?
[116:14.64]I already have a shotgun.
[116:15.62]Do I have this shotgun?
[116:19.50]Maintain your weapon by... Oh, okay.
[116:26.59]So that's a pump action shotgun.
[116:34.44]So I have a double barreled pump action.
[116:35.96]Okay, this looks pretty good.
[116:41.61]I didn't have this before.
[116:42.45]Cool.
[116:48.32]Well, it was definitely worth being here then.
[117:22.71]Just testing out the bed.
[117:27.85]New journal entry.
[117:31.19]Sleep on guns.
[117:32.27]Alright, I've got the money.
[117:34.29]I've got everything I need.
[117:34.89]It's time to go.
[117:36.29]But let me just see.
[117:36.93]Premium cigarettes.
[117:37.59]Okay, hold on a second.
[117:39.60]So you're telling me that if I smoke... Where are they?
[117:50.24]Very cool.
[117:50.66]Snake oil, snake oil.
[117:51.82]Where are the cigarettes?
[117:52.64]Oh, they're, okay.
[118:00.69]Premium cigarettes.
[118:01.53]Premium cigarettes.
[118:11.06]Okay, take.
[118:15.05]Okay, he found a cigarette card.
[118:16.20]One's all cards.
[118:16.70]Okay, so I do have to get all the fucking cigarette packs.
[118:20.64]So I have to smoke a shitload of cigarettes.
[118:27.11]I need to just drain all these cigarettes.
[118:31.05]Premium cigarettes again.
[118:38.97]This is the equivalent of trying to get the fucking prize in the bottom of the cereal box.
[118:44.73]You just dump the cereal out.
[118:48.64]Just quick, smoke them all so you get the toy.
[118:55.70]Okay, well, I got him.
[119:04.94]Alright, I've been in here long enough.
[119:06.20]Let's go.
[119:10.80]I'm ready.
[119:14.13]So that was... What the fuck?
[119:19.55]Let's get the shit out of me.
[119:23.27]So now... What's next on the list?
[119:28.92]Go back to John.
[119:31.98]Which is what I'm going to do.
[119:33.18]Because I had that set up like 40 minutes ago.
[119:39.60]Hold up, am I looking over at that tunnel?
[119:40.86]Have I been swimming for two hours?
[119:43.98]What happened to the time?
[119:44.70]I've been swimming for two hours.
[119:48.57]Holy shit, time's just melting.
[119:52.49]Two hours.
[119:53.41]What?
[120:00.54]Have I been stuck in a time loop or something?
[120:02.06]Holy shit.
[120:12.30]Time flies.
[120:12.85]Man, I'm seriously, like, I'm... This game just melts time.
[120:15.41]It's just, you just do fucking anything.
[120:24.21]Just no matter what you do, this is always something to do.
[120:27.08]Even if you get lost, even if you fuck up, there's just so much going on.
[120:32.82]Like, for instance, this.
[120:34.88]I'm about to get off the horse and see what's going on over here.
[120:41.12]Like, this shit is just so fucking cool.
[120:48.27]A free basket of picnic stuff.
[120:52.27]Those are expensive.
[120:53.93]That's expensive.
[120:56.16]And I can't even take any more.
[121:00.04]What?
[121:00.30]Oh.
[121:04.32]Hey.
[121:07.88]Dog.
[121:08.02]Can I pet him?
[121:08.88]Alright, you're fine.
[121:39.24]Hey, you're a good dog.
[121:41.10]Yes, you are.
[121:42.68]You're such a good boy.
[121:45.05]What a good dog.
[121:49.87]This is barking in my face.
[121:53.63]You're fine.
[121:54.93]You're okay.
[121:55.31]Just go back to where you were with your owner.
[121:58.33]You're good.
[121:58.89]All right.
[121:59.47]Good dog.
[121:59.83]Goodbye.
[122:04.14]Yeah, I know.
[122:07.18]I know.
[122:07.56]I know.
[122:09.87]Get out of here.
[122:12.83]Get out of here.
[122:15.35]Mangy mutt.
[122:17.97]Go on, get out of here.
[122:19.19]Get out of here.
[122:20.61]Stupid mutt.
[122:22.29]Get out of here.
[122:22.95]Mangy mutt.
[122:23.30]Get out of here.
[122:23.82]Stupid mutt.
[122:24.80]Go on, get out of here.
[122:39.55]He's still barking at me.
[122:41.89]He's so far away.
[122:42.81]Get outta here!
[122:50.86]Another five minutes gone.
[122:53.26]Yeah, man, that's just what happens.
[122:56.46]This game is 150 hours long, not because the game is 150 hours long, but because you just do whatever you want.
[123:08.75]Did I just stub my toe?
[123:09.65]What happened?
[123:10.57]Oh, I think it was an animal.
[123:11.49]What was that?
[123:15.93]Animal?
[123:18.92]Oh, it's a snake.
[123:24.02]Okay, I got it.
[123:40.42]I'll take the meat.
[123:41.84]That was a rattlesnake.
[123:43.36]That was a rattlesnake.
[123:44.28]That's like a death.
[123:45.12]That's a death in one bite.
[123:50.97]Yikes.
[123:54.13]Well.
[123:56.95]I don't want... What a thrill.
[124:05.26]That's a death sentence, man.
[124:06.02]You get bit by a rattlesnake back in the...
[124:09.20]1800s.
[124:10.94]Early 19th century.
[124:12.02]You're dead.
[124:14.46]You are dead.
[124:25.87]Through the river.
[124:27.25]This is the strange route this is taking me on.
[124:39.80]Just eat canned spam and you'll feel good.
[124:45.73]Move!
[124:50.39]Damn it!
[124:51.35]Look out!
[124:52.99]Alright, don't get all worked up.
[124:55.53]Give me a moment.
[124:56.66]My blood was getting up.
[124:58.26]You think you're tough?
[125:00.34]Shut up!
[125:12.30]Shut up.
[125:15.80]See, he's the bad guy here.
[125:17.94]Not me.
[125:18.26]He's the one with the shot.
[125:21.11]That dude showed me.
[125:22.31]No, he didn't even hit me.
[125:24.21]He missed.
[125:33.59]I'm not the bad guy.
[125:37.37]What, I called the guy a name?
[125:38.61]A crazy feeling you've been having?
[125:40.92]Think that's cause there's so many O'Driscolls about.
[125:43.24]Hmm.
[125:44.18]Law never seemed to find the bodies in this town.
[125:47.48]Damnedest thing.
[125:52.78]You looking to prove something here?
[125:54.53]Look at you, another coward.
[126:00.49]Should've stayed home.
[126:02.67]Parcel for ya.
[126:06.34]Oh shit, this old man's kicking my ass.
[126:09.06]Stay down.
[126:10.72]Stay down.
[126:11.56]You done?
[127:04.21]Fuck the O'Driscolls!
[127:19.34]I had to take him away, but no one was gonna see it.
[127:23.56]All that for 90 cents?
[127:24.68]I'm sorry, guys.
[127:25.56]I have this Wild West.
[127:28.02]Gotta play the part.
[127:29.96]Lawless.
[127:32.44]1800s.
[127:33.86]Rival gang.
[127:35.51]Talk shit to me.
[127:37.11]I stop.
[127:38.03]I'm like, get off my horse.
[127:39.07]Excuse me, sir, what's happening here?
[127:40.79]I'm just trying to defuse the situation.
[127:42.77]I'm gonna punch you in your face!
[127:44.07]Gets punched in the face.
[127:45.01]Twice.
[127:47.33]Gets knocked around.
[127:48.45]Starts to defend myself.
[127:51.19]Knocked a guy out.
[127:52.85]And then you bring him to a field and stomp his head.
[127:54.89]I mean, that's just like what happened.
[128:20.11]No, they just got shot.
[128:21.17]Yeah, well... That guy was an old Driscoll.
[128:25.89]Don't act like that guy is so innocent.
[128:27.93]That guy was a murderer.
[128:31.87]A thief.
[128:33.97]An outlaw.
[128:36.87]He tried to kill me.
[128:37.93]All of his friends are trying to kill us.
[128:46.60]Like you.
[128:48.12]Exactly.
[128:49.12]So if somebody wants to stop me and say, hey, you're a bad person.
[128:55.57]If you're going to try to take out the king, you better not miss.
[128:57.45]You know what I'm saying?
[128:59.77]Let's go.
[129:00.07]Can I eat his food?
[129:10.23]Please take a bath.
[129:12.09]Hey, you're a bad dude.
[129:17.28]Good morning, Arthur.
[129:19.78]Hello.
[129:20.82]Hello.
[129:22.84]Where's the tuba?
[129:23.30]It's on the horse.
[129:24.68]Good morning, Arthur.
[129:25.69]All right, I've got some money to spend here.
[129:27.09]A lot of it, actually.
[129:27.93]So let me see.
[129:35.11]Real variety, chewing tobacco.
[129:36.83]Let's get... Dutch wants something comfy.
[129:42.29]I feel like I should get this out of the way.
[129:46.07]Throwing knives, shotgun, and rifle.
[129:47.23]Anything else?
[129:49.23]Horse station would be great to have more room to hitch.
[129:54.34]Coop.
[129:57.46]Yeah, let's upgrade Dutch.
[129:59.18]I need to pay some money, though.
[130:07.05]Now here's the real question.
[130:08.05]Do I give the gold bar?
[130:11.73]Or do I just pay some money up front here?
[130:15.08]No, no, no.
[130:16.14]I'm going to go to the fence.
[130:19.66]Well, what do we need?
[130:20.20]Like 130, 125?
[130:21.04]Not that much.
[130:21.50]So 140.
[130:21.62]I was going to give like 130.
[130:46.47]I'll give 140.
[130:46.83]I don't want to have them be at zero.
[130:55.81]Can you buy it with your own money?
[131:01.46]No.
[131:03.44]Well, I got the achievement.
[131:04.30]I wouldn't have got that if I didn't do it.
[131:06.36]Alright, Dutch.
[131:07.84]Here you go.
[131:10.06]Here's a comfier bed for you, Dutch.
[131:14.00]Such as lodging has been upgraded, other camp members have been inspired to contribute more.
[131:24.91]Okay.
[131:26.81]Next in line, Arthur wants a map to help plan journeys.
[131:33.18]Upgrade Arthur's lodging unlocks the fast travel map.
[131:38.61]Oh dear.
[131:43.72]How much money do I have?
[131:44.72]I got a lot of stuff to sell, too.
[131:50.08]But I don't know if I... I'm not sure if I want fast travel.
[131:52.44]I feel like there's so much to experience.
[131:59.83]I think this... I think this is... I don't want to do this right now.
[132:04.79]Because then you miss out on the random strangers.
[132:06.97]Once I've seen all those, then I'll jump around, you know, later on.
[132:12.90]They don't have to use it.
[132:13.84]Yeah, but I also will keep $260.
[132:16.02]Horse station.
[132:23.64]When you're 50 hours in, you'll need it.
[132:25.22]Yeah, that's a good way to look at it.
[132:27.14]Not right now, though.
[132:30.74]Okay, so... What do I have for... Ammunitions and arms.
[132:34.56]Supplies.
[132:37.43]Throwing knives, shotgun, and rifle ammo.
[132:41.55]Yeah, I got the gold bar, but I want to keep it because I think I might want to buy a gun.
[132:49.49]Or I could get a chicken coop.
[132:53.54]Let's do this one.
[132:59.66]Throwing knives, just to have it here.
[133:01.46]Just to feel like it's nice to have.
[133:08.07]Fire bottles and high velocity repeater ammo.
[133:11.76]Do we really need more guns?
[133:14.12]We don't need more guns.
[133:15.42]Chicken coop.
[133:16.90]Local farms are selling off old coops.
[133:19.08]140.
[133:19.28]They got zero dollars, though.
[133:25.36]Yeah, I'll take the chicken coop.
[133:27.06]Chicken coop has been purchased to increase the quality of Christian stew.
[133:34.97]Cool.
[133:38.07]Although I'm kind of getting... running out of money here.
[133:43.52]Okay.
[133:44.18]That should be good for now.
[133:46.64]I'm gonna go eat the stew and see if it's any better.
[133:49.07]I am gonna give a little bit of money, though, because they're at zero.
[133:56.49]We'll just leave them with, like, 20 bucks.
[133:59.29]So they can at least eat hamburger meat.
[134:01.45]Or whatever the hell they have here.
[134:07.47]Okay.
[134:08.26]So now at least they're not without proper, at least, funds.
[134:12.78]Okay.
[134:17.05]Morning.
[134:20.23]I think it's time that I take a look at this shit.
[134:26.25]Because I need to make one of these.
[134:29.64]All types of tonics.
[134:31.16]Upgrade the medicine wagon twice at the ledger.
[134:35.26]And then I need a perfect deer, perfect buck, perfect elk.
[134:39.56]I can do this one, but I need to go hunting.
[134:42.11]Sell the bar?
[134:43.77]Yeah, I'm going to go to the fence right now.
[134:48.85]Upgrade the chuck wagon.
[134:50.25]There's just so many things here.
[134:52.27]I really just need to spend, like, three or four hours.
[134:58.52]Poor snakeskin.
[135:01.42]I got the perfect snakeskin.
[135:03.38]I'm not gonna give you, though.
[135:05.66]This is for funs.
[135:09.83]He's playing major damage.
[135:11.49]Well, I'll just donate that.
[135:14.28]Springy meat, pick that.
[135:16.84]Predator bait, I'll keep it.
[135:18.18]River bait, scent.
[135:19.58]I'm going to keep the snakeskin.
[135:20.78]Now, let me look at this.
[135:24.26]Main campfire.
[135:25.72]Campfire log seat cover.
[135:26.50]No.
[135:35.94]Scout campfire.
[135:36.84]He's just paying the money you gave back.
[135:43.79]Donate the skin so I can use it in crafting.
[135:45.87]Do I have to do that?
[135:46.85]I thought I had to just hold it because it was one of the recipes.
[135:49.93]Or can I just give it to him?
[135:53.58]Alright, I don't want to chop wood anymore.
[135:54.96]Let's talk to John.
[136:00.46]Let's continue the main mission we were just doing.
[136:02.94]But, no, I gotta try the stew.
[136:04.06]What am I talking about?
[136:04.66]I just upgraded the stew.
[136:05.52]Eat it.
[136:05.78]Tilly, I'm trying to eat.
[136:08.54]Hmm.
[136:29.65]Thank you.
[136:30.41]Maybe I'll go take a look.
[136:32.39]Anything else?
[136:34.03]No.
[136:34.87]Just that.
[136:35.87]Well, keep looking.
[136:37.13]Nasty boys.
[136:38.41]Will do.
[136:39.33]OK.
[136:42.21]Robbery tip.
[136:44.47]I've had a few of those so far.
[136:46.23]Can I not?
[136:46.61]I want to eat this.
[136:50.49]Nasty boys sounds like chat.
[136:54.23]Nasty boys.
[136:57.77]Let's see how the quality has increased.
[137:02.92]Ah, food still sucks.
[137:03.88]Take a bath?
[137:07.24]140 dollars.
[137:07.70]Arthur.
[137:28.53]Do you like your new tent?
[137:29.75]Because I bought it for you.
[137:32.55]Not even a thanks a lot, man.
[137:33.85]Not even a wow, you've contributed two.
[137:36.67]Like, thousand dollars to me.
[137:40.28]I did that.
[137:40.78]You'll pay it back.
[137:55.61]Alright, part two of the oil spill.
[137:58.45]It only took about an hour and a half to get there.
[138:02.27]I think we need another man.
[138:04.23]Charles?
[138:05.07]I'll go get him.
[138:06.57]Meet us at the wagon when you can.
[138:08.51]Sure.
[138:09.69]See you, Arthur.
[138:11.37]Ain't that dumb.
[138:13.23]Next time, let the wolves eat all your brain.
[138:15.87]Then you'll be a genius.
[138:26.79]Okay.
[138:34.08]It's all blinking.
[138:40.86]He's so rude.
[138:56.91]Hey, Abigail.
[138:57.95]Come here a minute.
[138:58.97]What is it?
[139:02.20]Can I ask you a favor?
[139:04.02]Probably not.
[139:05.86]Very funny.
[139:07.28]Would you do something with Jack?
[139:10.22]Do something with Jack?
[139:12.08]All this upheaval can't have been easier.
[139:13.68]Gotta hang out with one of my friends.
[139:15.36]Because I'm your preferred nursemaid?
[139:18.63]Because he likes you.
[139:20.23]Well, you know his father's useless.
[139:24.35]Okay.
[139:25.41]Thank you.
[139:28.86]Alright, Jack.
[139:30.06]It's time for us to go have a fun time.
[139:32.37]Go, Jack.
[139:34.65]Jack.
[139:35.15]Jack.
[139:36.47]Hey, what are you saying?
[139:37.89]Jack.
[139:46.81]Alright, me and Jack.
[139:49.18]We're going to go drinking together.
[139:50.42]I'm going to take him out.
[139:52.44]We're going to go to the bar.
[139:53.32]We're going to get fucked up.
[139:56.59]What do you say?
[139:58.15]Jack is a child.
[139:59.87]What you up to?
[140:00.87]Never mind.
[140:03.19]Anything fun?
[140:03.91]I guess.
[140:06.31]I thought it was like one of the gang members.
[140:08.51]Fishing?
[140:09.75]Sure.
[140:10.72]You're right.
[140:12.78]It's about time that you started to earn your cape.
[140:16.68]OK.
[140:17.08]Good.
[140:17.84]All right, you got your fishing rod?
[140:18.89]Let's go!
[140:42.34]Okay.
[140:43.30]Jeremy.
[140:44.58]Be fucking very careful.
[140:48.22]I ain't.
[140:48.52]Alright.
[140:53.70]Let's go then.
[140:55.32]So, where are we going?
[140:57.46]Just down to the river near here.
[140:59.63]We shouldn't go too far from camp.
[141:02.49]Oh, okay.
[141:03.65]You feeling better?
[141:04.53]I know you was a little sick.
[141:06.45]Oh, I'm fine.
[141:08.43]You're a brave kid.
[141:10.53]So, just like you.
[141:12.13]Well, I don't know about brave.
[141:14.79]I ain't much of a kid no more.
[141:17.77]Well, your mama might disagree.
[141:20.29]Earn a few other women, I guess.
[141:22.55]What do you mean?
[141:25.07]I'm just talking, silly.
[141:27.29]Been a tough few weeks up in that snow.
[141:29.47]I like the snow.
[141:31.83]Yes, but not like that.
[141:33.85]When are we going back to the other camp?
[141:36.65]The one near Blackwater?
[141:38.96]Yeah.
[141:39.88]Well...
[141:41.55]we're not let's let this play out for now anyway why I forgot a storybook there we left so quick well I'm sure someone can get you another storybook really I can find like a book first
[142:06.51]Okay, are we here?
[142:09.41]I think we're here.
[142:12.49]Uh, I'm wanted here.
[142:16.13]Bounty hunters are not going to come over here, right?
[142:17.83]Of course it's just shitting.
[142:20.93]Come on.
[142:21.43]Mm-hmm.
[142:35.23]No, like coyotes and anything.
[142:36.73]Just by the water there, you mean?
[142:39.79]Over here.
[142:42.02]You show me where, Uncle Arthur.
[142:46.22]Right over here, son.
[142:48.18]Stand over here.
[142:49.52]Right here.
[143:00.05]First...
[143:01.77]We need some bait.
[143:03.21]Bait wheel.
[143:04.09]Cheese.
[143:06.86]You put cheese?
[143:09.96]You don't... You put corn?
[143:17.48]Well, we're just gonna do... We'll do cheese then.
[143:20.50]I'm gonna use some cheese.
[143:22.28]Cheese?
[143:23.92]Okay, like this.
[143:24.30]Ooh, that feels nice.
[143:50.60]Like that?
[143:51.84]That's it.
[143:52.70]Good.
[143:53.40]That felt good.
[143:54.22]All we do now, Jack, is wait for a fish to take the bait.
[143:58.48]How do I know when I've got a bite?
[144:00.60]Well, if you feel the tip of your fishing rod just twitching, don't yank it yet.
[144:05.57]I have vibration turned off, I think.
[144:06.75]That just means one's nibbling.
[144:09.55]If you feel a hard tug, that's a fish going for the bait, so yank hard to hook it.
[144:17.41]Am I going to be able to tell with vibration off?
[144:19.45]There we go.
[144:19.99]I got it.
[144:20.31]Oh, I have to rotate right stick?
[144:22.53]What's going on with the camera here?
[144:34.09]See him fighting there, Jack?
[144:36.69]That's when you gotta be careful.
[144:38.35]You'll break the line.
[144:40.13]Best to wear him out first before you try to reel him in.
[144:44.05]That's actually a pretty good fishing mechanic.
[144:46.22]Look, Jack, it's a bluegill.
[144:49.20]It's almost as small as you.
[144:51.40]We should really throw these smaller ones back.
[144:54.78]Give them a chance to grow up a bit.
[145:01.76]Oh, that meant throw it back.
[145:02.80]Can I take a break from fishing?
[145:05.34]I want to make something.
[145:07.30]Okay.
[145:10.81]Really?
[145:11.13]What does he want to do?
[145:14.13]Hold on.
[145:14.79]Let me get one more.
[145:16.27]I'm going to pick some of those red flowers.
[145:18.71]I'll be right back.
[145:21.76]I'm being a very bad guardian right now.
[145:24.98]Hey, wait.
[145:25.28]Hold on.
[145:25.74]I'm going to try my luck over there.
[145:31.80]Okay.
[145:35.14]I should... I don't think I should let him just go by himself.
[145:38.64]Do I not even care about this?
[145:40.75]Where is he?
[145:51.03]Oh, God.
[145:51.41]He's going to get lost.
[145:52.33]No, there he is.
[145:53.37]I've got to keep my eye on him.
[145:57.22]I think I got one.
[146:01.56]Seems like he's taking a rest now.
[146:04.00]I'm gonna try reeling him in nice and steady.
[146:09.34]Overprotective father.
[146:10.42]This one's a chain picker.
[146:12.54]Not bad.
[146:14.42]Alright, this one sucks.
[146:15.46]I'll throw it back.
[146:21.02]Fishing sure is boring, Uncle Arthur.
[146:24.74]I know.
[146:26.22]Boring as hell.
[146:28.30]But then, something happens.
[146:31.49]Have cheese on it.
[146:32.41]This does feel nice, though.
[146:36.87]It does.
[146:37.19]This ain't just a cheap fishing minigame.
[146:43.35]It's pretty well thought out.
[146:44.97]Come on.
[146:46.61]Come on.
[147:02.71]You gotta stick at things, Jack.
[147:05.09]I know.
[147:05.55]Something's tugging at your rod, Uncle Arthur.
[147:09.77]There.
[147:10.19]Got him.
[147:11.25]Pull him in.
[147:17.63]That's a big one.
[147:24.29]Throw it away.
[147:36.34]What a fine young man And in such complex circumstances Arthur isn't it Arthur Morgan?
[147:45.52]Who are you?
[147:46.40]Yes Arthur Morgan Vander Lynn's most trusted associate
[147:53.17]You've read the files.
[147:54.70]Typical case.
[147:55.54]You got those badges at the party store.
[147:56.90]Don't trust them, Jack.
[147:57.42]Orphan, street kid, seduced by that maniac's silver tongue and matures into a degenerate murderer.
[148:03.61]Agent Milton?
[148:05.13]Agent Ross.
[148:06.25]Pinkerton Detective Agency.
[148:08.35]Seconded to the United States government.
[148:11.15]Nice to finally meet you.
[148:12.98]We know a lot about you.
[148:14.42]Do you?
[148:15.02]You're a wanted man, Mr. Morgan.
[148:17.40]Trailer.
[148:19.06]$5,000 for your head alone.
[148:21.14]$5,000?
[148:21.40]For me?
[148:25.47]Can I turn myself in?
[148:26.93]We want van der Linde.
[148:28.89]Old Dutch.
[148:29.95]I haven't seen him for months.
[148:31.79]That so?
[148:32.61]Because I heard a guy fitting his description robbed a train belonging to Leviticus Cornwall up near Granite Pass.
[148:42.09]Oh, ain't that a little... ...old fashioned nowadays?
[148:45.98]Apparently not.
[148:48.10]Listen...
[148:50.64]This is my offer, Mr. Morgan.
[148:53.30]Bring in Vanderlyn, and you have my word, you won't swing.
[148:58.07]Oh, I ain't gonna swing anyways, Agent... You know, I have dead eye.
[149:01.85]You see, I haven't done anything wrong, aside from not play the games to your rules.
[149:07.99]Spare me the philosophy lesson.
[149:10.33]I've already heard it from Mac Callender.
[149:13.69]Mac Callender?
[149:15.69]He was pretty shot up by the time I got to him.
[149:19.99]So really, it was more of a mercy killing.
[149:24.13]Slow, but merciful.
[149:28.93]You enjoy being a rich man's toy, do you?
[149:31.92]I enjoy society, flaws and all.
[149:34.92]You people venerate savagery, and you will die.
[149:38.38]Savagely.
[149:39.46]All of you.
[149:40.10]We're all gonna die, Agent.
[149:42.02]Some of us sooner than others.
[149:45.08]Good day, Mr. Morgan.
[149:47.15]Goodbye.
[149:48.43]Enjoy your fishing, kid.
[149:50.41]While you still can.
[149:51.59]That's Stan Lee.
[149:53.08]That was Stan Lee.
[149:53.70]We just saw him.
[149:54.20]Who are they?
[149:55.38]That was him.
[149:56.74]No one to worry about.
[149:57.62]No one at all.
[149:58.86]Come on.
[149:59.56]Let's pick up your things and get home.
[150:07.44]Mayor, he's in every one of them, you know.
[150:08.98]It's getting late, Jack.
[150:10.78]Your mother would be worried.
[150:11.82]Let's head back.
[150:15.04]All right, let's go.
[150:21.29]Somebody just said they had fish back then.
[150:24.53]Yeah.
[150:25.41]Yes, they did.
[150:35.05]Head back to Horseshoe Overlook.
[150:37.81]Why did you lie about where Uncle Dutch is?
[150:41.57]Because... Well... Because those are disagreeable men.
[150:47.98]And I don't want them to hurt him.
[150:50.64]What did they mean about Mac?
[150:52.88]Is he in jail?
[150:55.98]No, I don't think so.
[151:00.12]I hope he's just fine where he is.
[151:02.60]Like I said, don't worry about them.
[151:04.35]The world is full of disagreeable men.
[151:08.63]That's why you got all of us.
[151:10.33]To protect you.
[151:11.63]Dead eye.
[151:13.19]Conversations like that make dead eye seem stupid.
[151:15.09]How about that necklace you made?
[151:16.33]You still got it, right?
[151:17.41]Yeah, I got it.
[151:18.82]Yeah, to an extent, yeah.
[151:20.80]I can agree with that statement to an extent.
[151:22.18]Did you like fishing?
[151:23.52]It was okay, I think.
[151:27.34]It's a lot of waiting around.
[151:29.63]It is.
[151:32.27]In a gameplay perspective, it's fun to Deadeye.
[151:35.47]In a story perspective, I have superpowers.
[151:43.48]There you are!
[151:45.22]How you boys getting on?
[151:47.06]Great!
[151:47.90]We caught a fish, and I made you this necklace.
[151:50.48]Ain't that pretty?
[151:52.24]Not the luckiest.
[151:54.22]Did you thank Uncle Arthur?
[151:55.32]No need.
[151:56.12]No wonder Stan Lee made the cameo.
[152:00.57]What's wrong?
[152:01.74]Nothing.
[152:02.59]Just met some folk.
[152:03.69]I better go speak with Dutch.
[152:05.49]Okay.
[152:06.87]Hey.
[152:08.27]You did real fine, kid.
[152:10.27]Thanks.
[152:14.32]We got a problem.
[152:15.46]What?
[152:16.46]I just met some guys out near the river.
[152:18.88]A fella named, um, Milton.
[152:21.64]And, uh, I don't remember the other fella's name.
[152:24.62]Ross.
[152:25.56]Milton and Ross.
[152:27.18]And they are employees of the Pinkerton Detective Agency.
[152:30.53]And they know about the train and they know we're here.
[152:32.29]Were you followed back here?
[152:33.83]No.
[152:34.31]They know we're near here.
[152:36.53]Now that's definitely not a complaint about Deadeye, by the way.
[152:39.11]They offered me my freedom in exchange they did.
[152:42.64]Why didn't you take it?
[152:44.78]Very funny.
[152:46.36]Well, what do we do now?
[152:54.82]I say we do nothing.
[152:56.66]Just yet.
[152:57.20]They're just trying to scare us into doing something stupid.
[153:03.24]We have turned a corner.
[153:06.79]We survived.
[153:08.25]Them mountains.
[153:10.41]I didn't even hear it.
[153:15.24]Yeah, that was just me saying that.
[153:28.22]How did I lose the fishing mission?
[153:29.89]How did I get bronze at the fishing mission?
[153:35.13]What?
[153:37.41]After arriving at the river, catch a fish within a minute and thirty seconds... I was just like... Only within seven minutes and twenty seconds?
[153:44.53]What a... What an odd number there.
[153:50.90]When camp requests are fulfilled, they appear as a... Whatever that symbol is.
[153:54.72]With the character in question, check in with him to complete the request.
[153:57.30]So, you saw Pinkertons, did you?
[153:59.76]Saw, met, and got the full message.
[154:03.56]What did you think?
[154:05.26]I think we're in real trouble, but the only way out is forward.
[154:10.78]I know.
[154:12.05]It's 7.20 somewhere.
[154:12.57]Blackwater business seems to have finished us.
[154:17.35]It's 7.20 somewhere.
[154:18.53]How are you?
[154:25.10]Poker?
[154:25.42]All right, so he's over there.
[154:28.12]Do I have a book for him?
[154:31.46]Make a big pot.
[154:32.44]I'm starving.
[154:34.26]What's he got there?
[154:36.47]Oh, that's a rat.
[154:38.09]He's chugging rat meat.
[154:51.85]What the fuck?
[154:52.39]What?
[154:54.15]I just tried to take the bowl from him.
[155:02.75]Okay.
[155:11.63]Like, ugh, dinner.
[155:12.47]I didn't even.
[155:35.60]What?
[155:41.29]I want to get one of them like chopping up Really happy come on chop over here I need to get a good picture here.
[155:59.61]Come on I'm taking a bath in the bowl
[156:12.98]This has selfies.
[156:13.78]This is not even a selfie.
[156:14.77]This is just the cameras set up on a tripod, I think, over here.
[156:17.63]I really wish you'd do that over here, but it's alright.
[156:23.25]Call him over?
[156:23.73]Where the fuck is he?
[156:30.57]Okay, here we go.
[156:38.51]No, he's going back over here.
[156:41.14]Mr. Pearson.
[156:42.83]Mr. Morgan.
[156:43.93]Oh, whatever.
[156:44.39]I don't think I have a book for this kid.
[156:50.59]Thanks again for coming fishing with me.
[156:53.35]I wish those mean men hadn't ruined it.
[156:55.77]Do I have a book for him?
[156:56.53]Don't worry about them, okay?
[157:00.93]I do have a book for him.
[157:01.79]I hadn't forgotten about that storybook you lost.
[157:05.22]Thanks so much, Uncle Arthur.
[157:07.88]Do you want to have this?
[157:08.94]I found it.
[157:11.08]Ooh, what do you got?
[157:11.76]What do you got?
[157:12.88]What do you got?
[157:13.30]What do you got?
[157:14.80]What is it?
[157:16.22]Chocolate bar.
[157:17.08]I got a Wonka bar.
[157:19.03]What can I do with the Wonka bar?
[157:34.22]Moderately restores stamina core and slightly restores Deadeye.
[157:39.49]Should I eat it in front of him?
[157:40.25]No, I'm going to save it.
[157:40.83]I'm going to hold onto that.
[157:43.45]You're very sticky.
[157:45.75]So you brought the loudmouthed kid back to us.
[157:49.05]I'm sorry.
[157:49.67]I wanted them to hang him.
[157:53.45]Wait, did he say, I wanted them to hang him?
[157:55.05]You've done good, Arthur.
[157:56.13]Hey, can you hold that thought?
[158:06.83]Alright, now we've got John over there.
[158:09.13]Let's take a look at what we've got.
[158:15.78]Micah or John?
[158:16.74]I feel like we need to complete the John shit here.
[158:21.74]Please bathe.
[158:22.49]Alright, where do I bathe at camp?
[158:25.51]Or do I have to go to a hotel?
[158:26.57]I don't know.
[158:31.01]Some lady I was speaking to in town told me about
[158:35.27]I have to go to a hotel.
[158:36.51]I have to.
[158:37.17]Well, then we'll make a pit stop on the way there.
[158:41.19]Going through town.
[158:42.21]Any town here that's not a town there.
[158:45.98]Not a town there.
[158:46.76]Do I really have to go all the way up here?
[158:53.56]Hotel.
[158:56.76]We're going way out of our way here.
[158:58.88]Is there another hotel this way?
[159:00.28]By John?
[159:00.68]I don't think there is.
[159:07.84]No, this is the only... I have to go all the way up here and all the way down.
[159:12.41]No, I'm going... This is too far away.
[159:19.05]We'll go down and then up.
[159:20.77]We're going down here.
[159:21.87]Into, like, the river.
[159:25.76]Take a train.
[159:28.12]Yeah, the nearest train stop, though, is far away.
[159:37.90]There's a town probably... Yeah, hold on.
[159:43.46]I'm going to go on the lake.
[159:44.26]I'll go on the river.
[159:52.93]I could take a train from... Take a bath here, and then take a train to here.
[160:01.85]Yeah, that's what we'll do.
[160:03.42]I haven't rode the train, so I think it's... Yeah, let's do it.
[160:10.82]I have not been on the train at all.
[160:18.69]There's a bunch of towns that I still haven't discovered yet.
[160:21.01]Oh, yeah.
[160:23.03]Totally, I believe it.
[160:26.53]Yeah, what happened to the Bray?
[160:27.33]This is a different horse.
[160:28.81]I have three horses.
[160:29.69]This is Horseback Sonic.
[160:32.45]I know, great name.
[160:33.27]Last one, I have Whisper and Thunder.
[160:41.75]It's getting dark.
[160:42.85]Hold on, let me turn the lights on.
[160:45.87]It is dark in this room.
[160:55.22]And let there be light there.
[160:56.04]It's okay.
[160:56.74]Good.
[160:58.64]Let's go!
[161:05.36]GPS auto-updated.
[161:06.42]What was that?
[161:07.06]Come on, man.
[161:11.22]Look at me, mister, I can afford three horses.
[161:13.76]Well, the first one was free, the other one was ten dollars.
[161:19.68]And I think I stole this from somebody, I don't remember.
[161:21.56]Ten dollars, oof.
[161:40.92]Okay, so, uh, let me pay the bounty off.
[161:51.56]Oh, shit!
[161:53.28]I'm here to pay a bounty.
[161:55.48]Welcome, friend.
[161:58.92]What do I owe?
[161:59.80]That's quite a sum.
[162:01.34]Fuck.
[162:01.60]I hope you learned your lesson.
[162:03.54]$85.
[162:05.58]Beats a sheriff's gun in your back.
[162:09.63]I'm not gonna go to the fence and sell the gold.
[162:15.99]Boston parking lot.
[162:19.05]Well, I got it in there.
[162:19.89]Okay, how do I get out of this?
[162:24.02]This is like a parallel park.
[162:32.58]Back up.
[162:36.10]I'm trying to back up and just won't do it.
[162:37.58]Come on, back up!
[162:43.41]There we go.
[162:48.92]That's a cute little horse.
[162:49.82]Hey, thank you.
[162:55.90]I like the blue.
[162:56.66]Look at his bark.
[163:10.64]I'm sorry.
[163:11.60]I need a rope.
[163:28.01]A bath is 25 cents.
[163:29.11]I need a bath.
[163:30.53]That's okay.
[163:31.35]Can you organize?
[163:33.57]I got someone warming it up for you already.
[163:35.45]Just head down the corridor there.
[163:39.66]Oh, it's you.
[163:41.78]Yes, it is.
[163:43.74]Last time I checked.
[163:45.98]I really don't need any more trouble.
[163:48.14]What did I do to this guy?
[163:50.48]I was just protecting a lady.
[163:53.09]Well, all behind us now, I suppose.
[163:55.81]So what is it you need?
[163:56.79]A bath, perhaps?
[163:58.87]I just paid for it.
[164:48.50]Scrub head.
[164:49.30]I need this on the face.
[164:54.16]What?
[164:57.20]A deluxe bath.
[165:04.81]What does that mean?
[165:05.83]Add special oils?
[165:07.01]Oh, no.
[165:07.91]Okay.
[165:08.07]You can just leave it to me now.
[165:09.39]Uh, okay.
[165:17.20]I'll be out of your hair in no time.
[165:21.36]No small talk.
[165:27.08]Well.
[165:29.68]Let me know if you'd like a bit of an extra scrub anywhere.
[165:33.32]My right arm could use it.
[165:35.93]What a waste of money.
[165:42.78]How am I going to do this circus act of putting my leg in the air?
[165:48.06]Oh, no.
[165:48.36]She just reaches down.
[165:49.12]Emo's only incoming.
[166:06.63]I do not like getting older.
[166:10.10]What did I do?
[166:10.46]Yes, indeed.
[166:11.44]What did I get?
[166:11.94]Did I pay the money?
[166:16.82]Okay, thank you.
[166:24.19]That was fun.
[166:27.99]You seem more relaxed now.
[166:30.91]How do I pour some of the wine?
[166:32.49]Alright, I think that should do it.
[166:37.40]Ah.
[166:37.46]I feel fresh.
[166:38.54]My clothes are all dirty though.
[167:16.74]This place sucks.
[167:18.44]Nobody has anything.
[167:19.18]Holy shit.
[167:51.84]Okay, I can't get out of the window.
[167:52.64]I was trying to get out from the window.
[167:57.84]I can't go back in here?
[167:59.56]What if I left a wallet in here or something?
[168:04.68]Okay, well that was a good bath.
[168:06.04]Thank you.
[168:09.63]Always a pleasure.
[168:31.52]Okay.
[168:40.74]Anybody up here?
[168:48.46]Oh, what a view.
[168:51.14]Hey.
[168:52.36]Why, hello.
[169:04.06]I've just compulsively opened drawers and there's nothing in them!
[169:22.05]Why did all these people get up here?
[169:23.13]Are these people sharing the same room?
[169:44.69]toddler look at me mommy all right let's go what's going on here there's like screaming in this room
[170:12.65]Wait a minute.

[170:14.21]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[170:15.15]Hold on.
[170:31.50]How do I... How do I use this?
[170:36.31]Can't break these locks?
[170:38.85]Oh, well.
[170:39.29]Okay.
[170:39.97]Well, I explored as much as I wanted to.
[170:48.46]Okay, so I'm clean.
[170:51.70]All fresh and ready to go.
[170:53.08]Where's my horse?
[170:57.53]Over there?
[170:57.85]Press circle?
[171:00.61]Yeah, I was trying to kick it.
[171:01.47]Didn't work.
[171:05.55]Can I jump from here onto the horse?
[171:08.07]I think I can.
[171:08.75]This is definitely something weird like that, right?
[171:10.35]In this game.
[171:11.55]Can I, like, triangle jump, like, from here?
[171:15.36]I need to be over there.
[171:16.22]I'm gonna impress all these people.
[171:18.48]This is gonna be so fucking awesome.
[171:24.72]I gotta do from over there.
[171:26.10]Wait, maybe not.
[171:26.58]Maybe he'll come over here.
[171:30.45]No, I gotta do from... Oh, hey, look at me, mom!
[171:48.26]It needs to be closer.
[171:49.10]I'll try to get it closer.
[171:49.90]Can I actually do that, or is it... Moving.
[171:54.34]I'm gonna do something fucking cool.
[172:01.57]Okay, here we go.
[172:05.27]Right there.
[172:05.53]Stop, stop, stop.
[172:06.05]Stop.
[172:07.41]Right there.
[172:15.44]And you thought I wasn't gonna fucking do it.
[172:17.14]Everybody in this town is just, like, screaming at how cool that was.
[172:22.81]Welcome.
[172:27.61]What's your problem?
[172:28.43]Hello, sir, how's the game?
[172:29.07]I just- I'm not gonna get 25 impress points with everybody here.
[172:31.81]That would hurt so bad, though.
[172:40.21]Okay, let's continue.
[172:46.13]You just squashed your ball.
[172:47.19]Yeah, my balls.
[172:48.99]My... Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[172:49.89]I was gonna go to the... The train.
[172:56.48]Where's the train?
[172:57.52]That's the stagecoach.
[172:58.60]Is there a railroad here?
[173:02.84]Railroad.
[173:07.22]Post office.
[173:07.84]Okay, there we go.
[173:10.23]Okay.
[173:22.38]People are arguing.
[173:23.02]About what, though?
[173:26.91]I don't know.
[173:27.65]Dog, please get out of the way.
[173:28.87]All right, here we are.
[173:34.45]I wonder how high you can.
[174:31.40]How far does this go down?
[174:32.48]From right there.
[174:33.48]Stay.
[174:37.41]How do I say stay?
[174:51.46]Wake up.
[175:14.89]Okay, just gotta get around here.
[175:26.70]Can't climb that.
[175:28.94]Come on, I can't.
[175:30.10]Yes, I can.
[175:30.76]It's right here.
[175:31.32]Can't jump up that.
[176:02.17]Okay.
[176:04.93]Here comes the high dive.
[176:31.69]If he didn't just go limp and have his legs fly over his head.
[176:35.47]Well, if you just like stayed still, it would have worked.
[176:52.59]He got too cocky.
[176:53.79]He got too cocky.
[176:54.35]He wanted to go too high.
[176:57.80]He wanted to jump a school bus and then he wanted to jump five school buses.
[177:02.11]Then it was ten!
[177:03.29]And he died!
[177:04.57]I need a ticket to Emerald Ranch, please!
[177:10.21]It was immediate, too.
[177:30.91]It was less than a half second.
[177:32.09]Ah!
[177:57.45]I think it's still possible.
[177:59.59]I just don't think you can jump.
[178:01.49]If I fell off the edge.
[178:03.10]I'm going to try it again at some point.
[178:05.42]If you just fall off the edge instead of jumping off the edge.
[178:20.37]What can the horse come with me?
[178:22.71]What's your problem, madam?
[178:24.57]Now, why would you say that to me?
[178:30.38]Let's go!
[178:58.06]Horses fall the whole time.
[178:59.72]I know.
[179:00.00]It's wild.
[179:00.80]Okay, John.
[179:09.12]Let's finish this.
[179:13.98]But first.
[179:19.97]I've got something for you.
[179:21.03]So.
[179:21.09]We've got...
[179:28.07]Oy.
[179:32.60]500 bucks.
[179:42.76]I don't want to sell it though, I want to lose it.
[179:51.18]Used in crafting.
[179:51.99]Can be sold.
[179:53.61]Can be sold.
[179:55.15]Can be sold.
[179:57.17]Sold for cash.
[179:58.63]Sold for cash.
[180:00.55]Sold for cash.
[180:05.44]Used in crafting.
[180:06.38]Or sold.
[180:07.90]I'm going to keep it.
[180:09.02]Anything that says used in crafting, I'm going to hold on to.
[180:11.14]Pen.
[180:26.82]500 bucks give it to me not even a comment about a gold bar not even like a whoa man where'd you find this everything else uh a large bag that can be sold for cash okay I'll take the 50 bucks too hydro I'm drinking I'm drinking water this whole time guys
[180:57.39]I've been consuming water the entire time.
[181:03.90]Prove it!
[181:04.26]Here's your proof.
[181:11.68]Well, nice doing business with you.
[181:13.80]I now have the equivalent of $500,000.
[181:15.58]Yeah, that was some good swift proof, you're right.
[181:29.92]Where did I actually get the gold bar from?
[181:32.32]It was in an abandoned, burnt-up town.
[181:38.68]I can't even pinpoint on a map where it was.
[181:41.60]My advice to you?
[181:42.37]Do a little digging.
[181:44.75]Do a little exploring.
[181:46.09]You'll find stuff.
[181:51.13]Alright, John.
[181:51.51]Where the hell are you?
[181:54.71]You're just right here.
[182:00.12]He, quote, found it.
[182:01.42]What do you mean, I quote, found it?
[182:03.80]I was walking around like an abandoned town!
[182:11.82]What does that mean?
[182:14.68]He found it.
[182:17.87]Hey!
[182:21.31]John, what are you doing?
[182:27.55]Yo, he's practicing his Deadeye.
[182:32.70]Okay, I'm going to say spoiler here.
[182:33.92]Spoiler, spoiler.
[182:34.72]This is a spoiler for an anime.
[182:37.55]It's an anime.
[182:40.15]It's not very good.
[182:41.45]I mean, it was alright to start, but I don't watch it anymore.
[182:45.19]So, close.
[182:46.03]Everybody close your eyes.
[182:46.91]Never mind.
[182:47.51]It's not John.
[182:59.36]Real fucking funny.
[183:01.77]You better sleep with your eyes open.
[183:03.25]Yeah, well, you're gonna sleep with your chest open if you ain't careful, boy.
[183:06.27]I love you, Arthur Morgan.
[183:10.54]I love you.
[183:11.52]Come on, take a shot.
[183:13.18]Come on, take your best shot, please.
[183:19.72]And then you come on the raid, witches.
[183:21.75]Raid?
[183:22.29]Don't be playing coy with me, son.
[183:24.37]It's unbecoming.
[183:25.45]That bloody train you and him has set up.
[183:28.49]You're going to need guns.
[183:29.51]You're going to need men.
[183:30.83]Oh, that.
[183:31.59]So Marston told you?
[183:33.21]It ain't a big show.
[183:34.95]I need calmness.
[183:36.66]If I take you, I might as well bring Micah along.
[183:39.10]Now compare me to that oil he toured again.
[183:41.40]You're a dead man.
[183:42.52]Fair enough.
[183:42.86]What are you doing here, kid?
[183:44.82]I'm coming, John.
[183:45.54]On the job.
[183:46.54]I said you weren't coming.
[183:48.38]Yeah, well, Arthur says I am.
[183:50.02]And it's his party, boy, so come on, let's go.
[183:51.99]Don't you guys think that John Marston could do a really good smash-mouth impression if he wanted to?
[183:58.79]No.
[184:00.07]Are we ready?
[184:01.58]Yeah.
[184:02.34]Train's due through tonight.
[184:03.80]All right, then.
[184:04.68]It's on.
[184:05.64]Charles?
[184:06.54]I'm ready.
[184:09.16]Gentlemen, let's go earn some money.
[184:17.39]Hey, all the horses untethered?
[184:19.75]Oh, we're going to go.
[184:21.59]I'm driving.
[184:22.59]They should follow on behind us.
[184:24.62]You find a good spot, wolf man?
[184:27.81]Yeah, follow the trail southwest.
[184:31.27]I'm gonna be dumping people soon.
[184:33.31]Remote, but still give them enough time to spot the oil wagon.
[184:36.61]What is with these turns, man?
[184:38.33]Watch out.
[184:39.17]What are the horses?
[184:40.07]Whose horses are there?
[184:41.06]Whose horses?
[184:41.54]Picks up a new team of guards to stay in line, so... All right, guys, it ain't a garbage truck.
[184:46.84]Hold on with two fucking hands.
[184:49.02]See, this is what I made.
[184:51.00]I disappeared for a couple of weeks, and you cut me out of all the action.
[184:54.81]Just the action that requires a break.
[184:58.86]Ah, you're the funny feller, John Marsden.
[185:01.06]Where my folks at?
[185:02.60]You had your feet up the whole time, playing sick, and fondling that new scar like you're going to buy a breakfast in the morning.
[185:09.89]You don't know what you're talking about.
[185:11.71]No, it's all our fault.
[185:13.15]I wouldn't want you getting scratched by a squirrel or something.
[185:16.91]That could put you out of commission for the rest of the year.
[185:19.67]Why do you have to speak so much?
[185:21.76]It's...cessing.
[185:23.86]Press O button.
[185:24.38]I just heard my dog bark.
[185:36.44]He's being so weird today.
[185:37.64]I think he's bored.
[185:38.58]He's been playing.
[185:39.36]He's been having so much fun here.
[185:40.58]I think he's just bored down there.
[185:42.06]I'm gonna bring him back up here in a minute.
[185:44.67]Too fast.
[185:44.85]Well, the horse is... If I hit brake... Yeah, your horse just ran into the fucking carriage.
[185:59.28]Not the devil, please.
[186:01.08]Not this again.
[186:02.64]Fine.
[186:03.44]Damn you three.
[186:04.75]Sulky, angry, scarface, a ripe barrel of laughs.
[186:12.09]How's Otto doing with the move?
[186:13.51]A lot better than expected, actually.
[186:15.25]When I moved the last time, he was really, really nervous.
[186:17.97]He was really sad.
[186:19.19]He was always whining at the door.
[186:19.95]Like, what are we doing here?
[186:20.83]He took to it very quickly.
[186:21.87]Remember, these are innocent folks.
[186:23.87]If we handle this right, nobody needs to die here.
[186:43.90]So he's doing pretty well, actually.
[186:45.64]He's doing great.
[186:49.95]Mr. Morse, Mr. Smith, Mr. McGuire.
[186:54.03]Get over there.
[186:57.65]When she slows, order.
[187:00.21]And you?
[187:00.43]I'm going to make sure she slows.
[187:02.08]I like it.
[187:04.34]Get moving.
[187:16.22]This doesn't seem like a bad, uh, this seems like a bad idea.
[187:20.48]Doesn't it take a train a mile to stop?
[187:25.14]They're going 40 miles per hour, but it takes them two minutes to stop.
[187:32.98]Yeah, what if the guy just doesn't care?
[187:34.31]He just keeps driving.
[187:49.77]I'm gonna go get Otto.
[187:53.88]Do you hear him?
[187:56.45]Hold on, pause this dramatic moment.
[187:59.53]Hold on, I'll be right back.
[188:00.79]Let's go grab Otto.
[188:41.09]Yeah, he came in and just went right on his bed.
[188:45.83]He just was like, I want to come in there and just lie down on the bed.
[188:48.69]Okay.
[188:50.24]What do you say, dog?
[188:53.78]What are we doing?
[188:54.86]Show.
[188:55.30]Show auto.
[189:00.70]Hold on.
[189:01.06]He's... Right there.
[189:05.45]You can't see him, but there he is.
[189:08.71]There you go.
[189:10.01]There's Otto.
[189:16.37]Yeah, he was just like, hey, I want to come in there.
[189:19.69]Okay.
[189:21.23]Alright, so.
[189:23.40]What is this for?
[189:26.84]What am I... The train has stopped.
[189:33.28]It's time to get on.
[189:43.05]Can you dog?
[189:43.59]Can you talk?
[189:44.25]No.
[189:47.03]They're not here.
[189:50.28]Hello, everybody.
[189:51.24]Who would that guy do?
[189:53.34]What do you got?
[189:54.38]Pour it out.
[189:57.26]Come on.
[190:13.39]What do you got?
[190:14.39]A dollar?
[190:15.43]That's it?
[190:15.71]What about you?
[190:18.07]Hey, what about you?
[190:29.25]What'd you say?
[190:31.19]What'd you say?
[190:31.83]That's right.
[190:49.78]Who said it?
[190:50.76]I don't know who said it.
[190:52.96]Somebody said, tough guy.
[190:54.78]Who said it?
[190:55.54]This guy right here, huh?
[190:56.44]Enemy.
[191:21.80]Alright, come on, like George Washington.
[191:24.45]That guy was just on the other train.
[191:25.91]Give it.
[191:27.21]You got nothing?
[191:28.43]Nobody has anything else?
[191:29.67]Don't hold out on us.
[191:32.13]We're bad guys.
[191:33.23]Okay.
[191:51.84]Dollar.
[191:52.68]Come on.
[191:53.86]Nothing.
[191:54.64]Nothing.
[191:55.12]Nothing.
[191:56.16]They just, no, they're not throwing air, they're throwing them like coins.
[192:02.30]We now manually attack enemies when aiming at them.
[192:23.30]There it is.
[192:23.94]I could finally use this thing the way that I wanted to.
[192:29.16]I'll clean the gun.
[192:49.88]Are you shooting me from behind?
[192:51.56]Robbed the baggage.
[193:03.35]He shot me.
[193:03.75]Yeah, he shot me right in the back.
[193:07.79]Money clip.
[193:08.50]I feel like I'm about to open up the whole thing here.
[193:11.18]Let's make a ton of money.
[193:12.30]Oh, Brandy.
[193:12.94]Oh.
[193:22.17]I don't want to miss any of this shit.
[193:23.45]There's always like weird hidden money clips and stuff randomly everywhere.
[193:26.61]Here comes the real money.
[193:31.53]Ten bucks.
[193:32.10]I'm not- that's not ready to- I'm not ready to leave.
[193:37.90]Not until every last drop is sucked out of the bottle.
[193:41.24]No.
[193:47.99]Okay, last one.
[193:48.87]And this is the big chest.
[193:51.01]This has, like, all the big money in it.
[193:55.89]We'll take that.
[193:57.35]Platinum pocket watch.
[193:59.69]Jewelry bag.
[194:00.43]And that's it.
[194:03.67]Arthur, we've got a problem.
[194:04.87]There's two assholes on horses.

[196:40.84]No.
[196:42.84]I don't know why I jumped.
[196:49.51]Almost down.
[196:50.07]Perfect.
[196:52.91]That.
[196:53.21]Look at that.
[196:54.07]Alright, let's hole up inside the weird Monopoly building.
[197:00.03]Easy, easy, easy.
[197:10.08]Okay.
[197:10.38]Everybody get in here.
[197:12.78]Finally, we lost her.
[197:15.34]Now no more danger.
[197:16.96]Let's get there.
[197:35.02]Uh, big bits came in.
[197:36.22]$55.
[197:36.44]Thanks for the $55, Kaltari.
[197:41.10]We can see why they call you the professionals in the outfit.
[197:44.04]Shut up.
[197:45.19]Thank you so much.
[197:46.03]Hey, what did I get?
[197:47.01]Gotta be $100 here.
[197:48.29]Very nice.
[197:49.23]You weren't even invited.
[197:51.73]We still need a rail, Big Tank.
[197:54.11]Enough for us to get out of here.
[197:55.65]Was that a setup?
[197:57.05]Law turned up real fast.
[197:58.89]I don't know.
[198:00.13]I don't think so, but...
[198:01.79]I'm starting to get nervous.
[198:02.87]Think they followed us from Blackwater?
[198:04.53]Maybe.
[198:05.57]They found me already near Horseshoe, but I think this lot was just locals.
[198:10.23]I hope so.
[198:11.11]I'm gonna head into Valentine, see if I can get something started there.
[198:14.21]Good idea.
[198:15.29]Either way, we should all go it alone right now.
[198:17.89]You know the deal.
[198:18.77]Don't be followed.
[198:19.84]Of course not, boss.
[198:37.13]Uh, yeah, that's a lot of money.
[198:38.73]So, but first of all, thank you to Kaltari.
[198:42.54]And they say, if I had to pay you a dollar for every German reference I've ever made, I'd be in debt for the next decade.
[198:48.42]Also, Lego Island stream win.
[198:52.57]First of all, thanks, man.
[198:55.29]Appreciate the extremely large donation here.
[198:58.73]Can't get in here.
[198:59.17]I don't think kicking it's going to help.
[199:03.93]To answer for your second question,
[199:07.42]I think you guys are going to be severely disappointed when I turn on Lego Island.
[199:14.04]You know what I'm saying?
[199:14.76]It's going to be funny for like 30 minutes.
[199:17.64]And then everyone's going to be like, wow, this sucks.
[199:19.57]Can you do something else?
[199:22.05]You know that's going to happen, right?
[199:23.17]I'm going to set up an entire virtual machine.
[199:26.45]Install this game through some strange magic to make it work.
[199:32.53]And in 20 minutes, people are going to be like, wow, this sucks.
[199:34.97]Can you do something else?
[199:37.90]It's gonna take me like all day to set it up.
[199:39.80]Let me pay off the other bounties I owe.
[199:48.22]Holy shit!
[199:49.85]I mean, I would react the same way.
[200:00.25]Let's pay off the bounties.
[200:04.89]God damn, it's like paying my taxes.
[200:08.72]I just made 700 bucks and I gotta pay, like, 100 bucks?
[200:14.54]The heck, man?
[200:16.70]Except it's not at all.
[200:21.53]That's like, that's me, I'm like, I've been murdering people.
[200:24.57]I've been killing people.
[200:29.80]Ah, shaking my head.
[200:30.58]I just, I hate when the government takes my robbery money.
[200:33.18]It's just not fair.
[200:38.84]Murder text.
[200:41.88]This is... alright, hold on a second here.
[200:43.72]Take a look at this shit.
[200:46.63]Look at that frameable painting to hang on the wall in your living room.
[200:55.21]That is beautiful.
[201:10.94]Looks like shit?
[201:11.88]What are you talking about?
[201:15.43]This is... This looks better than half the movies I think I've ever watched.
[201:19.57]Morning.
[201:25.49]Morning.
[201:31.94]What happened to my other horse?
[201:36.32]Other horse is fine.
[201:37.06]It's stabled right now.
[201:45.14]Get off the tracks, you Sunday driver.
[201:47.00]The train makes so much noise.
[201:49.54]I'm not going to get hit by the train right now.
[201:53.06]I just wanted to walk the tracks and see this stuff in the distance.
[201:57.53]In fact, I think the train comes from in front of me.
[202:08.63]I can hear it.
[202:09.35]You can't hear it.
[202:10.65]The train is not on the way.
[202:12.03]I guarantee it.
[202:21.64]I hear it.
[202:22.84]You don't hear it.
[202:24.80]I would hear it.
[202:25.44]I have headphones in.
[202:26.64]Well, one headphone in.
[202:27.64]I would be able to hear it in one ear.
[202:44.55]What is going on up here?
[202:49.31]Did you see this, like, scary person?
[202:52.63]Oh, it's a scarecrow.
[202:53.93]Okay.
[202:54.75]That may... Never mind.
[202:55.81]Well, it worked on me.
[203:02.48]See?
[203:02.96]Look behind you.
[203:03.92]No train.
[203:04.36]There's a campfire over here, though.
[203:12.24]So, wait.
[203:12.58]It didn't work on me.
[203:13.40]I wanted to investigate.
[203:14.22]It didn't scare me away.
[203:15.12]Speaking of investigating...
[203:20.24]What do we have here?
[203:22.28]A campfire.
[203:25.68]I knew I should have investigated.
[203:34.89]What's the matter with you?
[203:43.89]Hey, calm down.
[203:46.57]Maybe you can help us.
[203:48.29]It ain't like this is going well.
[203:50.60]What do you need?
[203:51.36]Really?
[203:51.70]Ah, shit.
[203:55.68]Nothing to lose, I suppose.
[203:57.88]Come on.
[203:59.02]The truth is, mister, our last batch of shine didn't turn out so good.
[204:04.12]You think you can help us with locating some ingredients?
[204:07.56]We could reward you for your troubles.
[204:09.76]Okay.
[204:12.18]Why not?
[204:13.65]Quest.
[204:13.95]I know what tobacco looks like.
[204:16.73]Collect two Indian tobacco plants from the surrounding area.
[204:19.87]Steel cigarettes.
[204:21.11]Wait, they might have, like, Pokemon cards in there, though.
[204:45.32]All right, tobacco.
[204:47.92]Tobacco.
[204:58.47]Look at the chest over here.
[205:02.60]Lots of flavors about with all these plants and herbs nearby.
[205:16.78]Tobacco.
[205:22.31]Tobacco.
[205:22.75]Is that the smelly tobacco scent?
[205:46.23]Why am I calling it like it's looking for me?
[205:50.99]What?
[205:52.35]I'm a psycho.
[206:02.67]Where's the tobacco?
[206:03.57]There it is.
[206:07.17]Found some.
[206:12.32]Here's a tobacco field.
[206:16.20]No, it's not.
[206:33.59]I know what... We both can't move.
[206:44.30]Okay.
[206:44.96]What is it, a pig?
[206:49.58]wild boar pristine hey whoa hey where's he going where'd he go wait I I'm already doing something else I can't
[207:22.50]I just start flailing around, throwing... What was that?
[207:28.16]That was a red one.
[207:33.34]Extract the tobacco from the pigs.
[207:45.33]Is there any tobacco anywhere over here?
[208:03.06]I'm just causing a stampede.
[208:04.94]Alright, let's take a look around.
[208:10.87]Nah, that's not pristine.
[208:27.16]Where the fuck is tobacco?
[208:39.80]Blind?
[208:40.86]Wouldn't it show up on this, when I do this?
[208:44.04]There hasn't been any tobacco.
[208:44.98]I haven't seen any.
[208:58.04]What the fuck is this?
[209:01.99]Yarrow?
[209:02.55]Well, okay, we're on the right track.
[209:12.95]And then is this it up here?
[209:13.99]I'm on the right track.
[209:21.29]Yeah, I found at least something.
[209:24.34]Those are berries.
[209:32.28]Evergreen huckleberry.
[209:33.36]Oh, I think I'm supposed to eat some of these.
[209:42.27]Okay, here's some more foliage over here.
[209:44.19]Okay, I gotta eat.
[209:51.44]There's a challenge to eat these.
[209:53.26]I have to eat four different kinds.
[210:04.38]Are these guys gonna... Is there a time limit on this?
[210:06.10]Are these guys gonna get sick of waiting for me?
[210:07.34]You know what I'm saying?
[210:10.18]But I probably would.
[210:12.68]Hey, remember we sent that guy to go do tobacco picking?
[210:17.38]Uh... It's been nine hours and he's not here.
[210:25.66]Time... Might as well take it.
[210:32.85]I have some tobacco already?
[210:37.53]That's mine, though.
[210:51.51]Tobacco.
[210:53.48]Got it.
[210:59.12]Oh, that was annoying to find.
[211:09.45]Is there any more of it?
[211:10.95]There's a wild carrot.
[211:21.18]You knew what it looks like?
[211:22.16]I told you I know what it looks like.
[211:23.40]It's just hard to find it.
[211:25.48]You gotta find this shit.
[211:26.60]Alright, let's go back.
[211:33.42]Whoa, there's a mushroom here.
[211:41.49]I'm not stalling.
[211:42.71]I'm picking up herbs.
[211:48.53]Look, I just don't want to, like, go to every story mission and then turn the game off.
[212:00.98]There's a tobacco right behind me.
[212:02.60]That'd be pretty funny.
[212:06.41]Alright, I got what you need.
[212:08.97]Here is your tobacco.
[212:12.71]Add the plants to the still.
[212:15.23]Well, that's a fire.
[212:16.62]Don't stand in the fire.
[212:21.10]Don't loot the ammo box.
[212:23.62]Loot ammo box.
[212:40.07]And?
[212:42.20]How does it look?
[212:44.52]Alright.
[212:46.70]I'm gonna give this a taste.
[213:07.90]Hmm.
[213:09.14]Well ain't so tasty, but dang if I don't get a prickly feeling real sharp Well, that sounds kind of interesting Why don't we rest up a spell and then whip up another batch later on?
[213:24.94]We got a real big tool in that chest there.
[213:28.24]Take it.
[213:29.16]I'd say you earned it Very generous.
[213:31.90]Thanks in this chest over here.
[213:33.88]Oh
[213:38.14]So I didn't need to steal this after all.
[213:39.38]I just get it.
[213:41.76]Aged Pirate Rum Moonshine.
[213:43.98]Okay, this is kind of cool.
[213:47.79]Aged Pirate Rum.
[213:48.75]Is that it?
[213:52.87]Cool.
[213:54.83]Thank you.
[213:56.17]Have a good day testing your... Tobacco.
[214:01.42]Hope it's good.
[214:30.70]No, you can have it.
[214:31.78]Alright, what are we doing?
[214:36.94]Bash their heads in.
[214:39.48]It's not my horse.
[214:41.87]There they are.
[214:47.63]No, I got it.
[214:48.53]There's a code of conduct.
[214:49.77]Okay?
[214:52.35]That I follow.
[214:56.38]If somebody starts shit with me, if somebody antagonizes me, I'm going to retaliate.
[215:05.25]Those guys were just like, hey... Ooh, I can skid with this guy.
[215:12.27]Those guys were like, hey, take that stuff.
[215:14.57]You helped us have it.
[215:16.53]I got rewarded for what I did.
[215:22.49]Okay, let me take a look at that.
[215:28.48]so oh boy this is far away I think I'm going to how far away is that that's actually not that bad it is though now it is let's go back to john I'm gonna take a stagecoach I've not done that yet
[216:07.70]I thought that was motorcycle speed of flying.
[216:10.00]I was trying to jump into the back of the wagon.
[216:57.92]I need to feed you.
[217:00.12]Your whores don't look so good.
[217:06.02]Good job.
[217:07.59]You did good.
[217:13.85]Horse drugs?
[217:15.43]No, you gotta save the horse drugs for when there's a big chase going on so you can gallop away real fast.
[217:21.02]You gotta be able to get out of there quick.
[217:28.11]Stagecoach.
[217:28.43]Might be getting too late, though.
[217:34.46]Yeah, the stagecoach is not available.
[217:40.74]It is nice and dusty here, though.
[217:44.82]Well.
[217:46.46]Okay.
[217:49.16]Take a ride.
[217:51.32]Search the chest?
[217:52.50]Anybody here?
[218:00.75]There's nobody here.
[218:05.67]Damn it.
[218:06.57]There's like a guy over there.
[218:07.77]Loud noise.
[218:10.41]I gotta wait for this guy to go away.
[218:33.26]Can I scream at this guy so he runs?
[218:34.72]Hurry up grandma, it's a 2x4.
[218:38.44]What if he just 2x4'd me?
[219:14.18]Oh, for the love of God.
[219:22.30]I can't even take a ride now.
[219:23.29]Alright, let's go.
[219:25.49]Where do I want to go?
[219:28.95]I want to go to... Hold on.
[219:30.87]Where do I want to go?
[219:31.49]I need to take this to Valentine, right?
[219:36.17]Yeah, Valentine.
[219:41.39]Seven dollars and ninety cents, man.
[219:46.69]You're gonna get a hundred dollar peaking fine.
[219:49.45]I'm really loving the jet engine in the background.
[219:58.02]Fucking PS4, can't handle it.
[220:17.23]I'm sorry.
[220:19.58]My PS4 is so loud when I play this, too.
[220:22.42]Yeah, that's what people were saying.
[220:28.68]This game just uses every ounce of power from the PlayStation 4.
[220:37.05]Nope.
[220:37.71]I don't.
[220:38.59]I've got a place to be, though.
[220:41.29]Am I playing on PS4 Pro?
[220:42.60]No, I do not have a PS4 Pro.
[220:48.89]Although, I probably should get one.
[220:50.99]Because they seem pretty good.
[220:55.61]Hello, John.
[220:56.21]So, feeling better?
[220:58.60]How's the scar?
[220:59.82]I heal pretty fast.
[221:01.38]Lucky you.
[221:03.46]So you're just lazing about, or you got any legs?
[221:07.88]I got something.
[221:10.08]You see them?
[221:11.05]Sure.
[221:11.33]Oh, you see yourself as a shepherd now?
[221:15.55]Maybe.
[221:16.79]Come on.
[221:18.53]Well, where exactly are we going?
[221:20.53]How can this run fine if Fallout 4 plays like poo?
[221:24.87]You know, that attempt to seem all enigmatic and interesting, that might work for Dutch, but for you, it just makes you look stupid.
[221:33.72]Come along.
[221:36.18]You'll see.
[221:36.68]That train job was a start, but we need more money until we can get back to Blackwater and collect.
[221:42.60]I'm here to tell you, if we try to collect that money anytime soon, it'll come with a noose.
[221:48.73]I was worried you'd say that.
[221:50.79]Dutch says that we... Dutch says a lot.
[221:52.91]Dutch says Dutch says that.
[221:55.49]Saying things.
[221:56.85]Oh, yeah?
[221:57.40]What was that, Jerma?
[221:58.18]What do you mean by that?
[221:59.78]Todd... I was a prize pony once.
[222:02.14]Now I'm a workhorse.
[222:03.18]What's his name?
[222:04.38]Dutch is... Wade Wilson?
[222:08.28]But... Todd Wilson?
[222:09.82]You was at that thing in Blackwater.
[222:12.29]We already seen Pinkerton's here.
[222:14.07]Todd Howard.
[222:14.63]New century's coming.
[222:16.46]Is there a reason why I'm leading the horse?
[222:20.05]Do I need to keep the horse with us?
[222:44.31]There's a hitching post over there.
[222:45.87]Oh, okay.
[222:46.53]Tether the horse and I'll meet you across the street.
[222:48.99]Okay.
[222:50.35]Whatever you say.
[222:53.16]How much is a PS4, bro?
[223:08.03]Is it expensive?
[223:08.91]How expensive?
[223:09.67]Gun store?
[223:11.21]Yep.
[223:12.73]400 bucks.
[223:14.01]I already have a sniper rifle.
[223:17.01]Is this gonna be free?
[223:17.77]Okay.
[223:43.50]Yeah, just because John wants something doesn't mean you have to buy it for him.
[223:49.74]Well, that's for free.
[223:51.86]Rolling block rifle.
[223:55.92]Okay.
[223:58.14]Another free gun.
[224:02.80]Let's deck this thing out.
[224:03.80]What do you say?
[224:05.20]Medium scope?
[224:05.82]Long scope.
[224:06.72]Come on, now.
[224:12.38]Barrel.
[224:15.44]Better rifling.
[224:22.40]Stock.
[224:23.90]Ooh, we could do, uh... That looks... I like the swirls.
[224:31.43]No, basic grain.
[224:32.19]I'm not gonna use this piece of shit.
[224:38.67]I'm not gonna use this rubber band gun more than once.
[224:40.93]I got a much better one.
[224:53.45]Looks like three bucks to do this.
[224:58.35]That looks good.
[225:03.68]Okay.
[225:05.16]What about ammunition here?
[225:07.66]Regular.
[225:08.20]How many do I have?
[225:08.74]83.
[225:08.76]I got a lot.
[225:09.66]I have plenty of ammo.
[225:20.58]Alright.
[225:21.50]Weapons can be purchased from the gunsmith, of course.
[225:23.48]I know.
[225:25.90]Okay, John, I've got a sniper rifle.
[225:30.69]One with a long scope.
[225:32.23]Let's go.
[225:36.75]So now I have two rifles.
[225:38.15]One is a medium range, and one is a long range.
[225:45.62]Why couldn't you have done that?
[225:47.66]Done what?
[225:48.62]Bought that gun.
[225:50.65]I had a run-in with that fella earlier.
[225:53.27]We ain't on the best of terms.
[225:55.15]You had a run-in?
[225:56.76]I've had a run-in with half that town.
[225:59.38]Calm down.
[226:00.94]It's done now, ain't it?
[226:02.64]Why are you being so cagey about all this?
[226:05.88]Always playing some goddamn game.
[226:09.07]Me?
[226:10.29]I ain't the one taking Jack on fishing trips.
[226:13.31]No, you ain't.
[226:15.47]If you say the boy ain't yours, what's the difference?
[226:18.53]You probably only run off again.
[226:21.41]Why are you so interested in my life?
[226:24.68]Ain't you got more to your own?
[226:27.62]Just do one thing or another.
[226:29.82]Not be two people at once, that's all I'm saying.
[226:32.32]It ain't that simple.
[226:34.20]You know that as well as anyone.
[226:36.14]Same as with you and that girl.
[226:38.70]What was her name?
[226:39.40]Don't you dare bring her up.
[226:40.34]That was different.
[226:42.10]No, it ain't.
[226:43.76]Just the same.
[226:44.78]Anyway, for the love of God, will you tell me what you got me doing here before I turn around and hit the breeze?
[226:50.57]There's a herd of sheep coming down to auction from Emerald Ranch.
[226:54.95]Folk in town were saying the owner's trying to stamp out every farm from here to Ansburg.
[227:00.61]Yeah, I know that place.
[227:04.83]Cinematic.
[227:08.31]Sorry, I bumped you.
[227:14.28]Phew.
[227:15.52]Beautiful.
[227:18.28]Let's head up to the ridge up there.
[227:29.19]Get a proper view.
[227:40.21]You're a beautiful man child Well, I didn't even do anything I've been sitting his side all right, but a couple of new ranch What I was like enjoying the cut see what did I do something notice too much?
[227:56.47]What I do is rifle you could buy yourself We shouldn't get too close.
[228:02.92]Let's not tell we know what we're dealing with.
[228:04.82]Oh
[228:07.54]This looks great, though.
[228:09.68]Alright, I got my rifle.
[228:19.61]I'm ready to lung scope.
[228:29.36]Still doing the cinematic joke.
[228:30.88]No, it looks good.
[228:32.16]Where the hell are these people?
[228:57.61]Go on, give him a warning shot.
[228:59.62]Something close enough to make him cut and run.
[229:02.36]This gun sucks.
[229:07.42]I can't see anything.
[229:10.02]Looks like one of them don't scare too easy.
[229:12.86]Put another shot in close.
[229:14.68]He'll get the message.
[229:16.88]Yep, that spooked him alright.
[229:24.63]Alright, let's go round him up.
[229:33.74]It's one of these.
[229:34.80]I remember these.
[229:36.12]This is the... I forgot about these from the first game.
[229:38.67]These ones are very fun.
[229:39.65]Hurting mission.
[229:40.53]We need to go.
[230:17.31]Hurting the mission.
[230:18.41]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[230:29.28]Back to the middle.
[230:33.60]You as well, come on.
[230:37.56]No?
[230:37.98]If I run him over, does the mission end?
[230:39.14]I hope not.
[230:48.44]I heard a shout.
[230:49.12]I was just bowling balled into the bowling pin sheet.
[230:54.11]That would have been real bad.
[230:55.15]That was almost a strike.
[230:56.15]Where is he?
[230:56.47]Get over there.
[231:20.74]Why am I using the monkey?
[231:22.22]Try to maintain a consistent speed.
[231:50.37]I haven't lost anybody yet.
[231:51.87]We're all good.
[231:54.67]No!
[231:55.11]Aim up!
[232:07.42]Get in there.
[232:14.62]Hurry up.
[232:23.00]What am I doing?
[232:33.48]Maintain and constantly be behind... Be careful not to trample the animals from behind.
[232:41.95]Woo!
[232:42.89]Woo!
[232:44.85]Woof!
[232:51.55]Easy, John.
[232:56.68]What?
[232:58.30]What is he talking about?
[232:59.10]I'm going the right way.
[233:00.88]Excuse me.
[233:04.32]Hurry up.
[233:06.55]Go!
[233:06.63]That guy just went in and closed his door.
[233:29.55]One more.
[233:30.77]One more.
[233:31.13]Get in there.
[233:32.91]Go on.
[233:33.33]Go on.
[233:33.73]Go on.
[233:34.11]Go on.
[233:34.49]Go on.
[233:34.89]Go on.
[233:35.29]Go on.
[233:35.75]Those are up, boys.
[233:37.21]There you go.
[233:42.25]Fine sheep.
[233:43.57]They're okay.
[233:45.19]You seem better around here.
[233:46.44]I'm glad I got that out of the way.
[233:48.10]I've seen ones with less ambiguity about their provenance.
[233:52.00]A lot less.
[233:52.58]What are you trying to say?
[233:54.22]I'm trying to say you give me 25% kickback and I won't say nothing to nobody.
[234:00.56]Everything all right here?
[234:01.60]Excuse me?
[234:02.94]Sure.
[234:03.66]I'll excuse you for 25%.
[234:05.21]I wonder if this guy's looking to get his head exploded.
[234:09.11]Folks swing for rustling livestock.
[234:12.07]25%.
[234:12.09]15.
[234:12.69]20.
[234:12.79]18.
[234:12.81]Done.
[234:13.09]Calm yourself, friend.
[234:23.45]I wanna do it so bad.
[234:55.90]Wouldn't it be just bad if I accidentally just fucking ran over him?
[235:00.10]After you get the money.
[235:01.04]Yeah, yeah, I know.
[235:02.06]You know what I really need?
[235:23.80]My armrests, do you guys ever get this when you sit in a desk or a chair for a long time?
[235:28.54]You get that, the red almost marks just painful on your elbows from sitting in the same chair.
[235:34.23]I need like little pads here or something.
[235:35.63]They probably make them.
[235:38.35]Come on, sunshine.
[235:55.18]padded armorists are the best.
[235:56.18]I mean, these have padding on them, but it's just hard rubber shit.
[235:59.54]Take off the armorists.
[236:00.43]I like having them here, because it helps with the posture.
[236:19.02]A few sheep.
[236:20.24]Leopold, my good friend, as long as you're here, why don't you and John go make sure there ain't no funny business?
[236:27.84]Of course.
[236:29.20]Gentlemen?
[236:30.33]Drink?
[236:31.63]Sure.
[236:34.45]Nothing like talking to old Strauss to make you want to blow your own brains out I should have left him where I found him all those years ago bookish little lustrian fresh off the boat his eyes out on stalks Well, I guess the nice to have you finishing school has some strange graduates that it does To your good health Thank you
[237:07.01]Did we get... Did somebody snitch on us?
[237:09.85]You don't know me, but you keep robbing me.
[237:14.31]My name is Leviticus Cornwall.
[237:17.87]I am not a man to be messed with by the likes of you.
[237:24.11]Get out here before I have these men killed.
[237:29.70]Well, we know John has plot armor as thick as a fucking coffee table.
[237:35.45]That's not that thick.
[237:37.03]As thick as Fort Knox.
[237:38.13]There we go.
[237:38.77]That would be not very much plot armor.
[237:40.57]Deal with this nonsense.
[237:58.39]Please, gentlemen, this is a terrible mistake.
[238:03.31]This is a case of mistaken identity.
[238:07.41]What is worse than admonishing a man for the sins of another who wants to be the Messiah?
[238:29.34]I definitely shot John like five times.
[239:17.85]That was an explosion.
[239:20.05]Shoot him!
[239:20.75]Shoot him!
[239:48.75]Did I miss a person?
[240:42.07]This is Pee Wee Herman music.
[240:44.12]It really is.
[240:45.74]Pee Wee Herman bicycle nightmare music.
[240:52.24]Ugh.
[241:10.25]That was good.
[241:11.69]You're still alive, aren't you?
[241:15.81]Don't leave me here!
[241:40.55]That was two of the same guy.
[241:42.50]Where is he?
[241:45.70]Oh, he's in the... Up, up, up.
[241:48.44]I'm not fine.
[241:49.54]Hurry up, Archer.
[241:50.08]Let's get out of here.
[242:09.03]Phoebe Herman, clown-like nightmare.
[242:15.67]Get him off.
[242:16.25]You make sure nobody's following us.
[242:18.57]We'll get back to camp.
[242:20.20]We're gonna gather the troops and get them to start packing up.
[242:24.10]Sure.
[242:24.90]We can't stick around after this.
[242:27.18]Let's go!
[242:27.68]Wait.
[243:01.07]Yeah, that was pretty close.
[243:02.43]That was very close.
[243:03.92]I need Deadeye.
[243:29.36]In the eye.
[243:29.90]Ryan, that was right between the eyes, actually.
[243:35.13]Horse!
[243:35.73]Let's go!
[243:35.99]Come on, come on, come on, come on!
[243:38.93]Let's go, go, go!
[243:42.31]Escape dead or alive.
[243:44.35]No, I mean, that's... I need to escape.
[243:46.51]Not escape dead or alive.
[243:47.83]That would not be escape dead.
[243:51.15]They're all the way back there.
[243:55.17]That'll be good.
[243:57.39]Am I gonna get like a $500 bounty now?
[244:04.86]We're good.
[244:06.14]Watch out for the stump.
[244:06.92]I missed it.
[244:07.40]I'm good.
[244:10.46]That was some weird split personality bullshit I just did right there.
[244:13.02]I just told myself to watch out for it and responded to myself.
[244:29.53]Still searching.
[244:30.15]I'm all the way out here.
[244:30.93]Come on, let's get this.
[244:40.02]So we got Dutch and Micah.
[244:47.20]So Dutch is closer.
[244:48.61]Micah's been there for a long time, though.
[244:56.59]Meet him at his camp near Strawberry and then his Dutch.
[244:59.03]This is definitely main storyline here.
[245:02.91]Dutch needs to speak to you.
[245:08.22]Do I have any other side?
[245:09.38]You know, I want to go look for a treasure.
[245:15.54]I have a couple of treasure maps.
[245:17.40]Why don't we go try to find it?
[245:19.04]Let's take a look.
[245:30.68]So we got treasure maps.
[245:33.97]High stakes treasure map.
[245:36.83]Okay, Jack Hall Gang Map 2.
[245:38.53]Okay, never mind.
[245:51.22]Never mind.
[245:53.78]What about the other ones?
[245:59.20]Hold on.
[246:06.55]Okay, high stakes treasure map one.
[246:13.73]Big water fountain.
[246:16.30]Go to the big waterfall.
[246:20.24]Which is... I feel like this is pointing at 6,000 different locations in the game.
[246:38.53]Follow the river, maybe?
[246:39.51]Because that's flowing from here.
[246:44.11]What if I go... Hold on.
[246:55.90]What, like, down here, maybe?
[246:58.48]Or down this way?
[246:59.12]No, just get me to the river.
[247:03.80]I'm gonna... That's gonna be from the river.
[247:08.41]Why would you tell me to go this way?
[247:14.41]I'm not gonna fall!
[247:17.27]See?
[247:18.51]Okay, let's find the mouth of this river.
[247:21.21]I'm gonna fall here.
[247:29.62]Because it's a waterfall.
[247:33.56]So the water's flowing this way, so let's go to the end of this.
[247:39.12]Right?
[247:39.32]Let me look at that again.
[247:50.86]It's in the corner of the waterfall.
[248:10.21]Don't kill the bear.
[248:13.55]Let me just focus on this one thing at a time.
[248:27.80]Bear, bear, bear.
[248:29.28]Is the bear not alive?
[248:30.16]There's no bear here.
[248:33.40]The water's getting still here.
[248:34.50]I don't know if this is correct.
[248:41.15]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[249:17.58]We got a lot of stuff.
[249:20.72]Oh, wait, wait, hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay.
[249:28.15]Calm down, calm down.
[249:31.69]Calm down.
[249:35.52]Okay, you're good.
[249:38.36]Loot, uh, let's probably have...
[249:41.62]There's a couple of driscolls down here.
[249:44.18]Six lives for some canned vegetables.
[249:46.28]Well, that's... Hold on.
[249:48.51]There's probably a chest in here somewhere.
[249:57.43]Some gin.
[249:58.05]What the fuck was that?
[250:04.13]Oh, it's...
[250:21.12]That guy was just standing there.
[250:27.81]That guy was innocent?
[250:28.49]No, what?
[250:28.95]What do you mean innocent?
[250:33.17]Is he?
[250:41.68]That guy was in a Driscoll.
[250:43.56]I said the red was on the map.
[250:46.50]Okay, why are you doing this, man?
[250:55.77]chest or anything pick up hat I'll take it looking for a chest there's probably one back here buy all their stuff I would assume
[251:24.34]Here comes the plane flying overhead Nothing in here The audio is still delayed I don't know why the hell that's happening Okay, well
[251:55.00]There's gin.
[251:59.10]Just random supplies over here.
[252:00.72]Crackers.
[252:01.24]I have so much food.
[252:08.15]Cocaine gum.
[252:12.45]Four cocaine gums.
[252:17.30]I don't see a chest or anything, though.
[252:32.88]I think that's it.
[252:37.30]I can loot this guy, which I didn't do yet.
[252:45.62]There are more people over here.
[252:47.98]What was I doing?
[252:49.06]This is before they knew that cocaine would kill you.
[252:57.74]Hold on, another little spot over here.
[252:59.12]Nope, nothing.
[253:01.62]I think they just had beer and cigarettes and cheese.
[253:24.51]Cigar.
[253:25.13]No, that's it.
[253:28.71]I'll take the cigar, though.
[253:34.57]Alright, back to it.
[253:37.29]Didn't miss anything, right?
[253:41.59]Doesn't look like anything else is here.
[253:42.73]Alright.
[253:47.82]Time to go to the mouth.
[253:52.14]Back to the treasure that's easy to find.
[253:54.40]Hey, man!
[253:55.34]Am I going the right way?
[254:01.11]Which way was it?
[254:01.63]Yeah, because I ran into him kind of this way.
[254:14.72]What the hell was that?
[254:19.18]All right, here it is.
[254:26.21]There's a waterfall.
[254:27.15]So let's go ahead and get off here.
[254:36.12]What?
[254:37.36]Hey!
[254:44.07]Did I actually find it?
[254:45.15]What do you mean, did I find it?
[254:52.32]This is the only waterfall I can imagine is in this part of the game.
[254:55.70]Right?
[255:00.66]That looks very... And it's over here.
[255:02.34]On the right.
[255:06.67]I know where all of them are if you need help.
[255:08.21]Well, not... No, I don't...
[255:12.70]I'm okay.
[255:14.40]I'm okay.
[255:18.05]I'd like to try to find them first.
[255:29.76]So, it looks like... Let me look at the map again.
[255:45.57]Okay, so... All the way to the right of the water... I think I have to be up there.
[256:10.24]Right?
[256:10.64]Because the first thing had a line.
[256:12.31]I don't think I'm gonna be able to get it from here.
[256:22.26]Maybe this is right.
[256:23.41]Right here?
[256:27.37]You see anything?
[256:31.50]I don't see anything.
[256:32.66]Oh, there's a log.
[256:36.92]Uh-huh.
[257:17.11]Oh, I just lost all my teeth.
[257:32.62]I'm not sure that I'd have to be up there.
[257:34.12]Just look.
[257:40.20]Look at the first image.
[257:42.40]The first image clearly is, hey, enter from up here, right?
[257:45.95]Because that would be above the waterfall.
[258:01.61]I'll give this one more try.
[258:02.55]I mean, why would this log be here, right?
[258:24.23]Maybe I'm, like, in the waterfall.
[258:34.66]this looks like it's it, right?
[258:38.48]It's not right here?
[258:39.26]Oh, shit.
[258:47.39]Okay.
[258:52.41]Oh, there it is.
[258:53.69]No.
[258:54.21]No, it isn't.
[258:56.82]Oh!
[258:56.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[258:57.66]What was that?
[258:58.14]Did I get it?
[259:00.74]Got it.
[259:07.85]And it's a map to five dollars and a map to another map.
[259:15.87]Oh, damn it.
[259:16.53]Okay.
[259:16.93]High stakes map two.
[259:21.95]Oh, shit.
[259:25.12]You unlock new reinforced equipment with the trapper.
[259:28.74]What the hell is this?
[259:33.84]Lake?
[259:34.68]Mountains?
[259:37.82]Is there water involved?
[259:47.17]And that's here?
[259:54.11]No.
[260:00.61]That looks like a... Hold on, let me see.
[260:05.19]Alright, well, there's this.
[260:06.32]There's this thing here.
[260:08.24]And there's this huge one down here.
[260:13.50]There's one up here.
[260:15.30]There's one down here.
[260:17.10]There's one up here.
[260:18.68]Oh, this is going to take a million years.
[260:20.50]There's one over here.
[260:33.77]Look to see if there's a house next to the lake.
[260:39.79]I mean, would that... Bingo!
[260:46.66]Right?
[260:50.14]Would that... Is that right?
[260:51.38]Would that show up?
[260:57.47]Hold on a second.
[260:58.21]What about this one?
[261:00.13]There's a structure right here.
[261:03.37]This looks actually closer to the other one.
[261:12.64]Yeah, that's double bingo.
[261:17.97]We'll try this one first.
[261:18.95]Wait, hold on.
[261:19.67]Is this that one, and then is there any other ones?
[261:22.39]The lake is not that big.
[261:24.95]This is a pond.
[261:25.81]We've got a house right here.
[261:26.77]I think that house is too far away.
[261:45.44]It could really be any of these, couldn't it?
[261:51.85]I mean, I'm going to take a wild guess.
[261:53.47]The house is right here.
[261:58.95]How far away are these from each other?
[262:00.54]Because I could go to that one.
[262:03.14]I could go bang, bang, bang, right?
[262:07.24]I guess I could go straight up from... No, no, no.
[262:08.58]Hold on.
[262:08.84]Okay, so I'll go straight up.
[262:10.58]I'm right here.
[262:11.12]I'll go straight up to this pond.
[262:12.18]Because that... It might just be perspective.
[262:15.96]So I'll go up from here.
[262:17.26]I'll take a look at this one.
[262:19.12]Hit this one.
[262:20.70]And hit this one.
[262:22.10]Just their own straight line.
[262:24.02]So, let's go.
[262:37.50]Then I went underwater.
[262:38.50]Finally.
[262:38.72]It's so dark and fucked up over here.
[262:43.43]Alright, I need to be...
[262:55.92]It's because it's night.
[262:56.92]Alright, well, let's go.
[262:59.33]Can the horse get there from here?
[263:01.31]I'm sure he'll figure it out.
[263:11.73]Hey, there you are.
[263:19.17]Star bear?
[263:20.17]What the fuck is that?
[263:24.75]Is there enough-
[263:59.43]What's with this camera?
[264:00.11]What up my ass?
[264:03.59]Pack of wolves.
[264:04.51]I had to deal with a pack of wolves.
[264:05.71]I don't want this horse to die.
[264:08.97]I need some core refilling, though.
[264:11.25]That's for sure.
[264:11.97]Alright, what do we got?
[264:12.83]I need some Deadeye.
[264:16.47]Fully restores Deadeye.
[264:17.57]No, I need Deadeye core.
[264:18.55]There you go.
[264:30.49]Feed the horse, too.
[264:35.36]Here, eat this!
[264:35.92]Let's go!
[264:40.02]What happened?
[264:40.52]Um... Alright, get on.
[265:28.14]Thought you were gonna steal my horse?
[265:29.86]That ain't gonna happen, I'm sorry.
[265:34.58]In fact, what did you have on you?
[265:35.94]I gotta get you out of the road.
[265:36.90]$1.50 and a bunch of junk.
[265:52.25]Shoot near the horse to make him buck off?
[265:54.47]Yeah.
[265:56.47]That was the theory.
[265:59.16]Pretty good theory, I think.
[266:02.94]Hey, we're here!
[266:03.42]We've entered legendary animal territory.
[266:22.10]The legendary water goat.
[266:25.42]Big, was that it?
[266:27.34]Legendary bighorn ram?
[266:29.12]Did I just- would it just walk by me?
[266:33.19]I gotta get my shit ready, hold on.
[266:37.87]Alright, I got my shotgun.
[266:38.95]Is that him?

[267:16.49]I got it!
[267:31.55]What do I do with it?
[267:43.62]Rocky mount... It's the wrong one.
[268:00.85]Where am I now?
[268:01.59]I didn't get the skin.
[268:09.50]That wasn't legendary.
[268:10.62]It was a normal ram.
[268:13.57]I was gonna say, that didn't look very legendary.
[268:15.53]Okay.
[268:18.95]Okay, I'm done with that.
[268:29.46]Did you eat it?
[268:33.31]No, see?
[268:33.89]It's still over there.
[268:38.03]Look, it's right there.
[268:40.67]was not the legendary ram in fact hold on a second I want the bow first of all I want the where is it rolling rock rifle with what's the what's the bullet that I want to use for this or should I just use the bow
[269:14.89]A high velocity rolling rock.
[269:23.19]Okay.
[269:26.44]So, let's do this.
[269:28.06]I'm going to try to actually get this done.
[269:30.58]You can make it up here.
[269:36.58]Come on, boy!
[269:37.42]Alright, legendary hunting time.
[269:41.90]Let's get ready.
[269:43.46]Make sure I have everything I need.
[269:45.74]So, I need pelts.

[269:49.60]Predator bait.
[269:50.46]Okay, I've got them.
[269:52.28]It's an herbivore, right?
[269:56.19]What are you... I'll pick it up.
[270:03.98]I'm, like, baiting into those.
[270:15.54]Okay.
[270:17.80]Let's do it.
[270:27.25]Go to the gold tracks.
[270:34.11]Looking for a place to start.
[270:35.21]No.
[270:36.83]No.
[270:43.07]High velocity dynamite.
[270:49.76]I'm in the area.
[270:50.46]Let's eat some mint.
[271:02.06]A couple clues here.
[271:03.38]We'll look for a legendary ram.
[271:07.80]Hey, stupid.
[271:14.45]Clue!
[271:20.13]Is that person wearing a mask?
[271:22.13]Like a clown mask?
[271:23.11]No.
[271:26.35]Here we go.
[271:28.66]Okay, here we go.
[271:32.06]Let's get the scent.
[271:33.06]I got my rifle.
[271:36.50]Claw marks.
[271:39.52]Big Horn Ram Tree Rub.
[271:43.63]Legendary Big Horn Ram.
[271:49.08]So it's the blue.
[271:49.92]It's the blue line here.
[271:56.87]Let's do this the right way, you know what I mean?
[272:04.77]Yellow if you see him.
[272:06.21]There's another clue over here.
[272:18.98]Fur on the ground.
[272:19.60]Big horned ram fur.
[272:21.90]Okay.
[272:23.04]Alright.
[272:25.44]Here he goes.
[272:25.94]Is that him?
[272:34.59]That was him.
[272:38.33]Is that him?
[272:42.57]Is that him?
[272:47.61]Was that him?
[272:56.02]I look like such an idiot to these people.
[272:59.78]I just wanted to confirm that it was him.
[273:13.08]There he is.
[273:14.12]Okay.
[273:23.29]Damn it!
[273:37.32]Come here, come here, come here!

[274:04.21]I should've just brought a goddamn fucking shotgun.
[274:17.20]Give me this fucking drink.
[274:23.12]Where the fuck did he go?
[274:24.12]I'm on the wrong track now.
[274:46.96]There he is.
[274:48.88]Let's walk the trail.
[274:54.08]And console keyboard turn.
[274:57.48]For the love of fucking God.
[275:01.50]Where am I?
[275:01.83]Where the hell is it?
[275:14.85]He's just, he wrapped around here and he ran this way.
[275:17.29]He ran around the tree.
[275:19.13]He's down here.
[275:23.25]He ran around in so many circles that like, it's hard to even know where the fuck he is.
[275:37.90]Elmer Fudd.
[275:42.02]Oh, fuck!
[275:48.92]He's still alive!
[275:49.86]Wait, what?
[275:54.72]He's still alive?
[275:55.67]I hit him right in the face!
[276:02.29]His head rocked back.
[276:07.14]Okay, hold on.
[276:07.84]Where is he?
[276:19.06]Oh, the fucking silly string everywhere.
[276:20.66]He's down there.
[276:38.80]The tracks are empty here.
[276:40.00]This way?
[276:44.02]That's not even the right animal.
[276:49.69]I lost him from here.
[276:50.57]That's a- That's my horse.
[277:04.52]I was gonna shoot the horse.
[277:05.78]Okay.
[277:22.12]He ran around so violently.
[277:24.78]Down here.
[277:31.85]He's up... Oh my fucking lord, he's far away.
[277:38.55]Jesus.
[277:48.40]Should I get on the horse for this?
[278:19.18]Is that him?
[278:23.01]Got him.
[278:30.15]Legendary.
[278:30.83]You've killed Legendary.
[278:31.87]Sell the pelt to the trapper who can then craft it into a unique outfit.
[278:38.95]Should I skin it or pick it up?
[278:43.89]I don't want to fuck this up.
[278:46.21]Skin...
[278:48.57]And then pick up body.
[278:53.81]This is going to be cr- I don't know.
[278:55.25]I just want to make sure this is correct.
[279:09.65]Legendary bighorn.
[279:10.57]Legendary ramhide.
[279:11.99]Grizzly mutton.
[279:14.35]Okay.
[279:15.87]Come here.
[279:16.19]I don't want to lose this.
[279:26.80]Can you get up here?
[279:32.15]Come on.
[279:36.09]You can make it.
[279:36.69]I know you can.
[279:38.27]There you go.
[279:45.67]Stow it.
[279:48.57]That was fun.
[279:52.05]Let's bring the whole body, too.
[280:12.98]That was a lot of fun.
[280:14.54]I mean, it was a little sloppy, right?
[280:19.01]But, that was fun.
[280:21.83]Weren't we doing something else?
[280:27.23]What were we doing?
[280:33.37]Oh, the treasure!
[280:34.03]Are we in the right place?
[280:35.31]It's very clearly not.
[280:41.51]I gotta bring this carcass back somewhere.
[280:45.64]I can't go here.
[280:48.56]Uh... Here's the trapper.
[280:59.89]Well, the trapper is right down here.
[281:01.09]I'm gonna go here.
[281:19.50]Might as well just get it done.
[281:22.42]Why is it telling me to go this way if I need to go that way?
[281:26.25]Oh.
[281:26.81]That's why.
[281:28.11]Okay.
[281:29.93]I see.
[281:40.24]There it is.
[281:40.62]The ram.
[281:44.54]Now, I'm not gonna get distracted by anything.
[281:48.49]If there's a person on the side of the road that's like, hey mister!
[281:51.39]I need you!
[281:51.99]I'm just gonna run them over.
[281:55.55]I got a special secret hat.
[281:58.80]Or a special secret clothes or something.
[282:03.12]Ah, something was chasing me.
[282:05.26]That was a turkey there, right?
[282:17.12]That was funny how you actually do have to shoot it in the head.
[282:20.78]Or wherever it's vulnerable.
[282:22.68]I had a headshot that went three times.
[282:24.70]With high velocity bullets.
[282:35.54]Use the ram and lure the legendary bear.
[282:38.02]No, I did that.
[282:46.49]I did that.
[282:47.51]Don't.
[282:48.25]You.
[282:49.21]Run into something now.
[282:50.41]Ooh, I did that.
[282:55.32]I just moved.
[283:06.29]No, I did.
[283:10.73]No, I did.
[283:14.47]Turn around.
[283:15.35]I'm not turning around.
[283:20.18]Why would I turn around?
[283:25.70]I'm trying to get to the trapper.
[283:31.06]Is there a butcher here?
[283:32.53]No, there's a butcher over here, though.
[283:33.73]I think I'm going to stick a peanut butter break here, because I haven't eaten.
[283:53.03]What the fuck is going- Excuse me, no, this is mine!
[283:57.23]Don't fuck up this meat, man!
[284:05.92]You want more?
[284:29.57]I didn't even get distracted.
[284:37.59]This is their fault, not mine.
[284:40.31]Those guys can actually steal all your shit.
[284:42.70]Oh, that would have been a nightmare.
[284:50.16]Alright, let's go.
[285:03.85]That would've sucked.
[285:07.92]It's rotting?
[285:08.48]What do you mean it's rotting?
[285:10.34]It's rotting!
[285:11.58]It can't be rotting.
[285:16.70]Oh, they got like a Nickelodeon guts obstacle course for me here.
[285:33.15]Places to be.
[285:33.67]Excuse me.
[285:35.21]Oh, oh, oh, oh, don't fuck me.

[286:35.56]Where is this person?
[286:37.30]What?
[286:38.34]Hello.

[298:52.36]So, and I was noticing I would drink beer, too.
[298:54.86]Like, I would drink.
[298:56.26]And my fucking back would just kill me.
[298:59.22]And I've been to the doctor.
[299:00.21]I've had my kidneys checked, my liver, my pancreas, my gallbladder.
[299:06.81]Everything's fine.
[299:12.95]Just don't have your eyes open.
[299:18.56]And if I don't eat something that has, like, gluten or bread... ...based... ...um, I don't feel like that.
[299:29.57]And that would be really, really sad, because I love bread.
[299:32.09]It's, like, one of my favorite things in the world.
[299:33.61]I love pizza.
[299:36.75]I love the bread you get before when you go to a restaurant and they come out with the bread and the oil.
[299:42.29]And the VRB screen is still on.
[299:44.57]You're right.
[299:45.05]Thank you.
[299:50.61]He's freaking out over here.
[299:51.63]What's the matter?
[299:54.18]He's got a trap on him.
[299:56.14]I got you, Hancock.
[300:07.91]Ooh, this looks painful.
[300:11.08]Whoa!
[300:13.98]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[300:15.72]Oh, my leg!
[300:18.18]Oh, Jesus!
[300:19.59]Oh, Jesus!
[300:42.32]I didn't know I had to... I thought you had to hold it.
[300:46.34]Because you have to hold everything in this game.
[300:50.09]What does he have here?
[300:51.11]Get off the fucking tree, man.
[300:52.75]Why is everything in Rockstar games tied to one button?
[301:10.00]I didn't know I had to tap it.
[301:10.90]I thought I had to hold it.
[301:13.93]Oh well.
[301:14.47]Sorry, buddy.
[301:18.87]You only get five buttons on a controller?
[301:23.43]That's true.
[301:24.11]It said in the corner to tap.
[301:41.14]Yeah, but like, you just see it and you press it.
[301:44.95]I actually didn't even hold it for that long.
[301:46.13]I pressed X and then, like, let it go.
[301:48.17]And, like, didn't tap it again fast enough, apparently.
[301:53.52]I only... I have... Oh, X. Hold.
[301:55.38]No.
[301:55.72]No.
[301:56.00]Let go.
[301:56.32]Tap.
[301:56.54]No.
[301:56.80]He's dead.
[302:15.01]I actually studied this for culinary and you may be suffering from that.
[302:19.61]Yeah, I don't know.
[302:20.59]It's been really weird.
[302:22.35]No, they're gonna stop me again, right?
[302:24.55]This is like the I'm gonna stop you bridge.
[302:40.61]But I'm probably just gonna go to the doctor and just get tested for, like, celiac or something.
[302:45.09]Just see what happens.
[302:49.21]Because that's just been really odd.
[302:53.05]My back has been killing me for three, four months straight.
[302:57.80]Stomach's been bothering me, and I thought it was, like, related to colitis and shit, but it's just not at all.
[303:07.28]There's my landmark that I know where I'm going the right way.
[303:11.44]Is my hair falling out?
[303:12.54]No.
[303:16.34]Twitch's top elderly streamer.
[303:21.32]Could it be stress-related?
[303:24.03]Um, I don't... I don't think so.
[303:30.59]Altitude sickness.
[303:35.51]Las Vegas is not... Like, elevated up on...
[303:41.94]Low-carb diet.
[303:45.46]What's that?
[303:55.65]Oh, two Legendary Rams back-to-back.
[303:57.93]Three Legendary Rams.
[304:02.21]Gluten-effect Celiac knock.
[304:04.23]Well, I have IBD.
[304:14.40]Well, that's what I mean.
[304:14.96]Like, just every time I have something that is based on bread or wheat, I feel like shit.
[304:24.92]And I'm trying to test this theory, so... I haven't done it at all.
[304:28.64]I haven't had any bread or any wheat or gluten-based anything for, like, three days.
[304:32.21]And I've been feeling pretty good.
[304:34.19]So I think I'm just gonna eat a large pizza tomorrow.
[304:37.31]And just, like, see how I feel in, like, an hour.
[304:42.27]Which IBD collects.
[304:45.87]You know, like wouldn't that, wouldn't that know?
[304:47.35]I would know then.
[304:47.97]That would be absolutely certain, right?
[304:52.11]Just order a large fucking pizza from Domino's.
[304:54.25]And just eat like half the pizza.
[304:57.08]And then just like sit there and be like, come on, here we go, come on.
[305:01.90]Or just eat like a fucking bunch of bread.
[305:04.44]Just to see.
[305:06.96]We're going all the way up here, aren't we?
[305:08.96]Where am I going?
[305:09.94]Okay.
[305:11.27]We're almost there.
[305:16.56]Die.
[305:17.38]I'm not gonna die.
[305:19.55]Yeah, then, like, the placebo effect, right?
[305:21.15]So I think I have to, like, maybe I'll talk to, like, Kim or something and be like, Hey, Kim, can you, like, put a bunch of fucking wheat in a dinner one night and don't even tell me when it was?
[305:29.23]And then, like, if I'm like, Fuck, I feel horrible!
[305:31.25]Like, essentially she's poisoning me, right?
[305:32.81]I'm just gonna tell Kim to poison me one night.
[305:35.80]Just to see.
[305:36.36]And so I have no connection to it.
[305:41.10]I just sprinkle, like, wheat flakes in it or, like, crush it up.
[305:45.52]Okay, here we are.
[305:54.38]Well, this definitely looks like it is the one.
[305:58.76]Because I have that little cabin there.
[306:01.08]So where is it?
[306:07.18]Alright, so there's a big rock in the middle of the lake.
[306:13.44]And then it's over a log or something.
[306:21.17]Oh, I'm probably really cold.
[306:22.05]I have pajamas on.
[306:28.96]Can I stand on this ice?
[306:38.22]Yes.
[306:42.78]Okay, so here's the big rock.
[306:47.28]Thin and crispy, way too risky.
[306:49.40]What is that?
[307:21.84]She shot it so hard it killed the battery.
[307:25.62]I'm weighing myself down right now, aren't I?
[307:34.48]Alright, I'm plugged in.
[307:50.17]Open your satchel and make space for a person to discard.
[307:52.96]Alright, I'm coming home!
[308:09.25]It's safe.
[308:19.23]Is it safe for him?
[308:28.66]He's perfectly fine.
[308:31.10]My voice is different
[308:59.52]Hold on.
[309:03.72]See?
[309:05.48]Look, you can play ice hockey on here, okay?
[309:07.74]It's safe.
[309:17.56]I can't... Okay.
[309:23.78]Alright, hold up, wait, wait, wait.
[309:25.94]It's getting foggy.
[309:30.31]So this is the big thing in the middle.
[309:35.75]Where is it?
[309:36.25]This thing looks pretty big.
[309:48.44]Okay.
[309:56.90]I can't see anything!
[310:03.70]This, like, little blizzard dust storm thing needs to get out of here.
[310:08.28]Well, there's the log.
[310:10.18]It's the log, right?
[310:13.64]Is it over the log?
[310:15.48]It was, like, over the log.
[310:16.40]Or is it on the log?
[310:34.81]It's on... It's, like, on the log.
[310:38.74]Okay, how do I... I have to get up there, then.
[310:50.27]Okay.
[310:51.27]There it is.
[310:51.77]What's the next clue?
[311:00.74]There it is.
[311:08.53]$15.
[311:12.92]What's next?
[311:15.24]Where is that?
[311:25.29]Where is that?
[311:38.79]Follow a path northeast, uphill from the fort.
[311:46.04]Okay.
[311:46.36]Okay, you guys want to prove once and for all that the ice can't break?
[311:54.34]Never mind, it didn't work.
[312:08.74]Shoot it!
[312:09.14]Shoot it!
[312:09.50]Shoot it!
[312:09.84]It's not gonna break.
[312:10.66]Watch.
[312:21.21]See?
[312:22.73]Ice doesn't break.
[312:27.29]Dynamite.
[312:27.90]I don't have any dynamite.
[312:46.55]All right, so path northeast from over through the fort.
[312:51.95]What the fuck are they talking about?
[312:53.53]Fort.
[312:59.21]Northeast.
[313:04.66]I don't know.
[313:13.25]Fort.
[313:13.73]Northeast.
[313:14.56]I just gotta fi- I gotta, like, go from here this way?
[313:18.02]Fo- Fort!
[313:18.60]Fort!
[313:19.04]Fort!
[313:19.38]Fort!
[313:19.72]Fort!
[313:20.22]Fort!
[313:22.16]Fort!
[313:30.84]Let's go!
[313:40.93]Spell Fort.
[313:41.57]F-O-R-T.
[313:45.58]Hey, hey, hey!
[313:46.38]Okay, wait, wait, stay there.
[313:58.49]I just screamed.
[314:15.21]That was fucking scary.
[314:16.41]Alright, what kind of bear is this?
[314:18.83]Are you still freaking out?
[314:20.53]Calm down.
[314:27.02]Can I put the bear on his back?
[314:28.38]Can I put the carcass on his back?
[314:48.76]Alright, I'm sorry about this, but... Come on, somebody fucking find it.
[315:12.96]Free stuff.
[315:16.03]That's cool, girl.
[315:17.87]Where the hell did he come from?
[315:26.60]Look, you can hide in that bear's body like Luke Skywalker.
[315:31.12]I just saved somebody's life.
[315:35.48]And there's free food there.
[315:50.01]Should I take this to the trapper?
[315:53.49]How far am I from the trapper?
[315:57.88]Pretty goddamn far.
[315:59.62]Okay.
[316:03.80]I'm like right here.
[316:04.68]Ugh.
[316:20.90]There's a trapper here.
[316:23.38]Um... I'm not allowed in here.
[316:28.21]To sell to any butcher.
[316:29.33]It's just shitty.
[316:30.25]I can't even go... Can I not go in here?
[316:31.59]I don't think I'm allowed in here.
[316:41.91]Well... How much money do I have?
[316:45.78]I'm just gonna pay the damn bounty.
[316:56.02]Just because you're not allowed doesn't mean you can't.
[316:58.16]You know, that's... that's true.
[317:01.30]Hold on, peanut butter.
[317:10.97]Hold on, the horse needs a little bit of, uh, love here.
[317:27.38]Oh, PB break!
[317:30.00]Come on, eat it.
[317:46.44]Peanut butter voice.
[317:47.24]You know how people do the weird... weird funny things?
[317:52.00]Wouldn't you just laugh like, oh, the cast of Star Trek!
[317:55.29]Sits at a table reed and reads their lines with peanut butter in their mouth!
[317:59.67]I can see they don't have the speed.
[318:03.36]Hey, somebody like, get on that.
[318:05.14]And make like 30 versions of it.
[318:22.18]Almost just ran the guy over.
[318:28.37]I'm not looking for anything.
[318:32.27]I'm watching you fish.
[318:34.85]Have a good day.
[318:36.21]Goodbye.
[318:36.59]What?
[318:38.39]You know what a knife is?
[318:45.72]Get out of here.
[319:04.22]Look, he's committing a crime.
[319:20.61]He's committing a crime.
[319:21.33]This guy's committing a crime right now.
[319:24.14]Help me.
[319:28.06]Help me, he's committing a crime.
[319:41.28]Loser.
[319:42.24]Not gonna do it when I have a fucking bodyguard when I have the police here, will ya?
[319:44.94]My health core is terrible.
[320:12.25]Eat more baked beans, please.
[320:19.24]You tear him as that kid?
[320:21.18]With a tattletale?
[320:22.62]Oh, I'm sorry.
[320:24.32]When somebody's firing a gun at me, I'm gonna be like, Hey!
[320:33.89]This guy didn't, like, steal my ball at recess.
[320:39.45]Uh, let's switch out the horse, too.
[320:40.55]While we're here.
[320:46.83]What do you got for horses?
[320:49.87]It's a big one.
[321:13.26]We got lots of horses to choose from.
[321:15.30]Work, war, and race.
[321:22.25]Now, I'll take, um, I've been taking, uh... Let's take Thunder out for a spin.
[321:32.11]Okay, I'll switch him out.
[321:43.00]Bye now.
[321:44.04]Hey, mister, over here.
[321:48.00]Hey, mister.
[321:50.02]What can I do for you?
[321:50.60]I can lose a fella like you.
[321:52.52]You want to make some easy money?
[321:53.80]Mm-hmm.
[321:54.22]Come with me.
[321:55.62]I can't talk here.
[321:59.93]That was horseback Sonic.
[322:01.03]He needs to take a rest, man.
[322:02.45]Go get him.
[322:04.87]You can't work the horse to hell.
[322:07.23]Work the horse to death.
[322:07.95]My bastard of a friend double-crossed me again, and I ain't going to stand for it this time.
[322:13.25]I'll give him a try.
[322:14.35]What, his name is Easy Money?
[322:53.79]If I hear any trouble, then I'm guaranteed to die because you're going to panic and start shooting people, and I'm going to be one of them.
[323:08.24]So, like, I hope that nothing goes wrong in this room.
[323:12.24]All right, man.
[323:13.04]I'll do my best.
[323:25.57]Didn't I open up all these already?
[323:37.51]On the bed?
[323:39.94]Mantle?
[323:43.54]Fireplace?
[323:44.08]What the hell is it?
[323:57.15]Something in there, but... Do I have to one by one close these drawers?
[324:04.46]I opened all these already.
[324:07.30]He just left the drawers open?
[324:17.09]Well, where is it?
[324:28.41]A suitcase?
[324:36.05]Um... It's too eas- Shut up!
[324:57.43]Hey!
[324:58.79]Quiet!
[325:00.11]I did that on my own.
[325:01.07]Nobody told me to do that.
[325:02.35]I did that because I wanted to see what was in the ceiling.
[325:06.46]Where the fuck is easy money, by the way?
[325:08.32]Do I have to refresh these?
[325:10.26]This is not the wrong room.
[325:16.12]Look at the mini-map.
[325:17.06]If I'm standing in the right room... I'm looking at the same draws already.
[325:28.25]Oh no, he's peanut butter drunk.
[325:31.17]Take money?
[325:32.15]That was not there before.
[325:33.75]Y'all know it.
[325:34.31]I had to refresh the...
[326:07.13]That's not my hat.
[326:12.35]There it is.
[326:19.27]Silver clamp buckle, a cigar, and...
[327:04.51]Last try.
[327:27.74]Wait, wait, wait!
[327:28.48]No!
[327:29.66]No!
[327:30.64]But it got away.
[327:31.82]I'm trying.
[327:56.58]chat.
[327:57.24]I might as well just fucking die.
[328:02.66]That was on purpose.
[328:04.75]I was looking at chat.
[328:06.03]Worst comedy TV show.
[328:07.41]Yeah, I agree.
[328:09.97]I was just trying to push the thing where I have to shoot people's heads off.
[328:17.70]Everybody.
[328:18.22]Remember that?
[328:20.20]Oh, that's far.
[328:21.24]Excuse me.
[328:23.16]Just go.
[328:23.68]Let me take a look.
[328:24.50]I'll handle it.
[328:43.80]I have to take all the... Ugh.
[328:47.05]I... Oh, well.
[328:51.29]I have some peanut butter in my mouth.
[328:55.15]Alright, where's the guy that I stole the money for?
[329:04.34]I just get to keep the money, okay.
[329:11.06]Why did you even do that?
[329:13.81]I don't know.
[329:23.36]Because I just... The opportunity presented itself.
[329:26.06]I couldn't... Look.
[329:27.04]Listen.
[329:28.32]I am a giant toddler, okay?
[329:31.33]I couldn't put him in the fire.
[329:32.97]Everybody, try and put him in the fire.
[329:34.07]Put him in the fire.
[329:34.55]I can't do that.
[329:35.27]He's not going to fit.
[329:35.81]I tried three times.
[329:37.03]I get upset at the fact that I can't do that.
[329:39.37]So I'm taking his head.
[329:40.83]And then you saw what happened.
[329:43.92]What you would describe as a... Someone that's an adult.
[329:49.98]But they're not quite out of the child phase yet.
[329:53.08]I'm not sure if there's a word for it.
[329:55.30]Like a large toddler.
[329:57.36]Man, you know what I mean?
[330:00.88]You know who really runs this town?
[330:03.05]Ladies of the line.
[330:04.53]Wait, what are you guys fucking calling me?
[330:07.85]Alright, what are we selling here?
[330:10.33]Adult baby.
[330:13.64]I'm gonna keep this food though.
[330:22.17]Oh man, boy.
[330:25.03]Bear claw.
[330:27.29]Now I'm gonna keep this stuff because I feel like the claw could be used.
[330:31.35]Where am I going?
[330:36.36]Oh, the fort, right.
[330:43.89]Will Ferrell in every movie why do I think that's so funny just Will Ferrell in every one of Will Ferrell's movies oh man this game is so much fun
[331:14.10]Alright, let me pay the bounties off.
[331:18.82]This is a long treasure hunt.
[331:20.40]It's been real fun, though.
[331:23.41]I... I love this game.
[331:31.05]I can't help it.
[331:31.69]Like, you just have to just do things.
[331:34.17]You can't... I can't.
[331:36.01]Maybe you can.
[331:37.49]I can't play these games like a normal human being.
[331:39.93]I can't do it.
[331:43.30]Every time I try, it lasts for about 30 minutes.
[331:47.19]And then, I try to throw a guy on fire.
[331:49.67]Like, I can't do it.
[331:53.33]Some people can do very well at, like, playing through the game and role-playing and doing the things that they want.
[331:58.37]No, I have to throw people into rivers and shoot people's heads off.
[332:02.79]It just sometimes has to happen.
[332:04.08]Like, I can't help it.
[332:09.40]Ready for a clean slate?
[332:17.87]Take care now.
[332:18.85]To my own detriment.
[332:19.97]I can't help it.
[332:20.53]Is that a cat?
[332:27.07]Okay, girl.
[332:28.69]I'm not gonna take kindly on you raising hell around here again.
[332:31.94]I just paid.
[332:32.50]I just paid.
[332:34.42]Don't make me take your head off with a shotgun.
[332:36.42]You know, that's what I'm known for around here.
[332:41.46]You haven't been talking about that?
[332:42.64]Uh, partner?
[332:55.59]Insane.
[332:56.27]Alright, let's go to the fort.
[332:58.15]Why... I'm not going to go to the actual fort then.
[333:02.70]Northeast from fort.
[333:03.78]I'm going to look for the two big pillars.
[333:27.64]Oh, I died, right.
[333:28.46]You're right.
[333:30.04]No, you guys are right.
[333:30.88]Hello.
[333:37.03]Morning.
[333:38.97]He goes from sucking up to authorities to get people arrested to shooting some guy's head off and punching his horse.
[333:43.77]But that was an accident.
[333:47.98]That was unintentional.
[333:58.09]Oh shit, somebody wanted me to... I'm so sorry.
[333:59.87]Somebody... There were some people coming in asking about the green screen.
[334:02.89]I just completely went... slipped over my mind there.
[334:07.36]Uh, so the green screen is happening probably this weekend.
[334:10.02]It'll give me enough time to get all the things ordered that I need to be ordered.
[334:15.88]The polls... Oh, not the polls.
[334:18.32]The suggestions are closed.
[334:21.96]And that, by the way, that is tentative for this weekend, because I need to make sure that I can get in to the studio for studio time.
[334:30.67]And I might need to give more than three or four days notice, so we'll see.
[334:34.85]But it will be, it's going to be happening, like, within the next ten days.
[334:38.09]Like, absolutely 100% guaranteed.
[334:42.74]Now, that is, like, a 100% guarantee.
[334:46.84]Because the wheels are already moving, so it should be good.
[334:56.72]Have I seen all the entries?
[334:57.94]I already spent... Back when there was no internet, when I was having all the problems with them fixing the problems that they had here, I went through every single submission.
[335:07.05]I've already got a list already ready to go.
[335:10.39]It's just a question of logistics now.
[335:12.45]Help me!
[335:13.65]Easy.
[335:14.31]I shall help thee!
[335:19.68]Hello.
[335:22.74]Help a blind man!
[335:30.60]Hold on!
[335:31.70]Hold on!
[335:32.44]Help is coming here!
[335:33.30]Hold on!
[335:36.73]Hold on!
[335:37.15]Oh no!
[335:42.65]It's happening!
[335:49.70]Just get away from me!
[336:01.96]Where's the horse?
[336:06.22]Can I get him up?
[336:29.93]I gave him the money.
[336:31.63]I gave him the money.
[336:34.97]I gave him the money.
[336:35.55]I did.
[336:35.79]Don't tell me I didn't.
[336:36.48]I gave him it all.
[337:07.96]Well, I saved her, okay?
[337:10.37]Not on the most clean means necessary.
[337:14.07]But I did.
[337:14.49]I gave the guy a dollar and I saved the lady on the horse.
[337:18.99]You know, some heroes don't need to be thanked, right?
[337:21.25]I did it.
[337:22.15]I did them both.
[337:29.17]Okay, so.
[337:32.15]I need to go to my satchel.
[337:36.36]So this is northeast from the fort.
[337:39.71]I'm gonna assume, let's see... Stay with me.
[337:51.77]Follow path northeast, uphill from the fort.
[337:59.22]Uphill from the fort.
[338:00.64]So, over here.
[338:09.59]This looks like a northeast past.
[338:12.93]Just don't want to get caught up in here.
[338:23.40]That's a nice horse!
[338:24.18]That's a nice looking horse!
[338:25.20]Hold on.
[338:25.52]What is that?
[338:25.96]What kind of horse is that?
[338:27.66]A Morgan?
[338:28.12]Ah, that thing sucks.
[338:30.20]And a Morgan?
[338:30.80]Ah, they both suck.
[338:32.20]Forget it.
[338:38.12]Are we going that way?
[338:39.50]I gotta be careful.
[338:42.27]This is not up the hill.
[338:47.77]This is down the hill.
[338:51.71]I don't think this is correct.
[338:57.28]Unless this goes up and around.
[338:58.52]Let's find out.
[339:00.92]Horse, what are you doing?
[339:05.60]Does this go up and around?
[339:30.82]but I'm going west now let's see does this go up the ridge okay hold on will this go around northeast or I wonder if it's going to stay going this way I wonder if eventually this wraps around because there was another one it might be the other one
[340:04.84]There is no other one, though.
[340:05.89]I guess there is this one here.
[340:06.97]Yeah, it must be this one.
[340:10.99]Let's try this way.
[340:38.87]Okay.
[340:40.97]So the theory is that this is now northeast.
[340:45.43]Do I eventually get to go up the rocks here?
[340:51.16]Look at the two large, like, nubs.
[340:55.78]This looks like it goes up.
[341:19.57]Okay, hold on, hold on.
[341:21.05]Let me get a better view here.
[341:21.95]Let's see if I can find those two nubs.
[341:39.88]Holy shit, this is beautiful.
[341:47.59]Ummmm...
[341:55.97]From the fort.
[341:57.84]Follow path northeast uphill from the fort.
[342:01.14]Pass through the gap between the two peaks.
[342:06.94]Gap between the two peaks.
[342:11.15]Where the hell is that?
[342:25.32]Did I go through the two peaks?
[342:33.79]Because there's the... Hold on.
[342:39.75]Right there is the fort.
[342:51.77]Two peaks?
[342:52.75]Are those peaks?
[343:07.26]All right, because there's the .. I'm going to just turn this way.
[343:52.67]Careful!
[343:54.59]I mean, is that right here?
[343:59.64]Like, is that it right in front of me?
[344:14.43]Jump and pull the parachute.
[344:15.81]Let me get a different view of the fort.
[344:38.17]So there's a path... Let me look at this one more time.
[344:41.50]Because it would be through... There ain't anything down there.
[345:02.73]Is it right there?
[345:08.20]So it'll be this peak over here.
[345:09.90]Okay.
[345:13.67]Makes sense.
[345:16.47]I'm on the wrong fucking mountain.
[345:26.17]Easy now.
[345:39.66]Is it I don't think that's correct We are all on the wrong mountain I Can't I can reliably get back over there
[346:07.17]I don't even know what the fuck this is even trying to tell me.
[346:10.01]Pass through the gap between the two peaks and take the left path down.
[346:29.59]The horse is just causing so much fucking problems here.
[346:31.67]Get out of the way.
[346:37.90]He's just, like, spinning around in circles.
[346:40.03]Alright, hold on.
[346:45.65]I don't have a wingsuit.
[346:48.49]I must need to look at this from the other angle, because it's just... It's almost impossible for me to see what the hell I need to do here.
[346:54.34]Alright.
[346:55.96]Because that's the path.
[346:58.00]These... That's one of the peaks.
[347:00.08]Go left...
[347:05.86]Is this it right here?
[347:07.66]Like, is this- am I just standing on it?
[347:14.16]Like, I wish I could pull the camera out and just look at the- from a big, like, wide angle.
[347:17.98]Because that's the path around that would be- that would be facing northeast.
[347:33.21]So that's the path, and then you have to go up-
[347:41.78]I just don't know if I'm on the right mountain here.
[347:50.95]It sucks if I have to go all the way down there.
[347:52.83]Because I have no reliable way to get over there.
[347:58.45]I mean, it has to be that.
[348:00.85]I just have to get the fuck over there again.
[348:02.31]This is going to be such a pain in the ass to get over there.
[348:13.83]I'm going to die a horrible death here.
[348:28.58]I'm fine.
[348:28.80]I'm going to have to get up there.
[348:36.49]Wing suit, activate.
[348:38.47]Don't!
[348:41.69]Oh my lord, everyone help!
[348:51.94]What did I just do?
[348:57.94]What was wrong about using the path?
[349:00.04]I don't know, I'm just... So I have to get up here.
[349:12.01]I think you can cross it Here
[349:43.00]Don't get taken by the current.
[349:48.97]Okay, so here's the other P. I think I need the horse for this.
[349:57.53]You coming?
[349:59.87]Look at that.
[350:02.30]Come on!
[350:09.14]I don't need this fucking horse.
[350:11.99]Fucking horse out of here Here I am Now now what whoa oh
[350:48.13]It's on the side, right?
[350:52.95]There's a little path on one of the edges.
[350:54.66]This looks like a little path.
[351:17.71]That looks like another little path.
[351:19.63]Oh, there's a symbol here.
[351:20.91]It's a rock garden.
[351:33.14]That's a big fall.
[351:36.50]Yeah, it is.
[351:37.04]All right, slow down.
[351:55.63]Nothing right there.
[351:58.89]Oh, shit.
[351:59.47]No, I don't want to know the rock carving coordinates.
[352:16.71]Down and then across.
[352:20.18]So I do have to go down.
[352:42.38]Now what?
[352:44.20]What the hell do I do now?
[352:55.67]You live there.
[353:01.57]There's a spot up below me.
[353:06.97]Can I survive this fall?
[353:39.12]Oh, man.
[353:40.88]Oh.
[353:45.43]Oh.
[354:09.53]I almost just did a fucking leap of faith right there.
[354:12.53]Here it is.
[354:14.17]I almost did a full running jump.
[354:19.00]Whoa!
[354:29.86]Wow.
[354:30.66]That's a lot of money.
[354:33.98]Please excuse my goofy from Disney.
[354:38.05]Exclamation there.
[354:41.82]That's $1,500.
[354:49.33]How do I get out of here?
[355:00.14]Very slowly.
[355:07.13]Is it way over here?
[355:11.22]I think I just die here.
[355:12.18]No, right here.
[355:16.79]To think I nearly missed it all.
[355:18.09]I was going to jump from here to there.
[355:20.83]I don't go this way.
[355:21.65]I don't...
[355:46.46]That kind of just baited me over there.
[355:49.66]Oh, the money's gone.
[355:52.02]Hey, we got 1500 bucks.
[355:53.34]We can do fucked up shit like this!
[355:57.99]Just go to the hospital and get it fucking recalibrated.
[356:06.25]Okay, well that one's done.
[356:07.33]That was cool.
[356:09.69]That was really fun.
[356:13.26]There's more.
[356:14.19]What an original joke.
[356:15.71]I know, really.
[356:16.57]That was actually really fun.
[356:18.99]Trying to find out where they are, and then that's a lot of money.
[356:21.55]So, what are the other ones?
[356:26.13]Three fucking gold bars.
[356:27.25]Okay.
[356:29.81]I got that one.
[356:30.99]Shows a landmark and other clues to help you find... This is Chick's treasure map.
[356:34.08]I got this from some random person, I think.
[356:35.94]No, I already did this one.
[356:37.22]It was a random quest.
[356:40.04]What about this one?
[356:43.54]Look at your money.
[356:46.18]$721.
[356:46.30]What would be your money?
[356:48.90]What do you mean you lost the money?
[356:50.24]What do you mean you lost it?
[356:51.30]What are you talking about?
[356:52.85]What do you mean you lost the money?
[357:12.63]Three gold bars right here.
[357:19.70]I had a shitload.
[357:21.64]I had like $800, $700 before.
[357:28.38]For real, though.
[357:29.70]This one is way too cryptic, I think, for me to understand right now.
[357:32.86]So I think I'm just going to do a mission.
[357:33.84]Because this one here... This one.
[357:39.90]What is this even trying to show me?
[357:42.84]There's nothing to read.
[357:44.52]It's just this.
[357:51.95]I don't know what that is.
[357:53.41]That's obviously the sun.
[357:59.75]Something where there are some little geysers out on the ground.
[358:03.54]Volcanoes.
[358:10.62]I don't think I've even seen a geyser in the game.
[358:12.50]Alright, well I got... I did that one.
[358:16.27]That one was a lot of money.
[358:17.99]I'm gonna go...
[358:20.49]I don't know what I'm gonna do now.
[358:21.27]What am I gonna do now?
[358:29.78]We are super far away.
[358:34.04]Uh, I could do Dutch or Micah.
[358:36.04]I feel like Dutch is kind of just back in camp, so let's just go back to camp.
[358:49.83]One of the swamp lands.
[358:57.00]I just have these gold varas.
[359:01.52]Going good.
[359:07.04]Sell gold, defense.
[359:08.30]Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[359:11.77]I don't need to do that right this second, though.
[359:13.11]I just need to have the fences available.
[359:15.07]The fence is all the way down here, isn't it?
[359:18.88]He's not, like, right here.
[359:20.32]He's far away.
[359:22.84]Where is he?
[359:23.16]Is he all the way down here?
[359:24.40]Where the hell is the fence?
[359:33.02]Yes, you do.
[359:36.35]I'm fine.
[359:37.75]I want to keep those gold bars.
[359:38.89]They look nice.
[359:51.54]Fence is in Emerald Ranch.
[359:54.92]Oh.
[359:56.66]Well.
[360:02.27]I'm afraid to have that much money on me, though.
[360:07.71]If I have $1,500... If I have, like, $2,500 on me, can I... I'm gonna get robbed.
[360:23.13]Oh, it's a little snake.
[360:25.67]Rattlesnake.
[360:29.81]The gold's gonna rot.
[360:33.11]Okay.
[360:52.94]Poor skin.
[360:53.84]Oh, well.
[360:57.28]I'll go sell a bunch of shit.
[360:58.68]Might as well.
[360:59.30]I would never carry two grand in my wallet.
[361:06.25]This is not going to be safe, but I'm going to do it anyways.
[361:29.56]And I'm still gonna get there faster.
[361:35.10]You really need that helmet.
[361:45.75]And look at that.
[361:47.07]I skipped probably two to three minutes of riding.
[362:14.17]How many horses have I killed?
[362:15.87]Zero.
[362:17.11]Well, I mean, does it count if you kill them and bring them back to life?
[362:21.30]If so, then maybe like four.
[362:23.82]Hold up here, hold up here.
[362:43.18]Can I cleave you?
[362:44.18]Or is this not gonna do it?
[362:46.97]Settle down, girl.
[362:48.35]What about the one that I drove off a cliff?
[362:54.79]Come on!
[362:55.69]Um... Yeah, I mean, that's true.
[362:59.39]Fire.
[363:03.53]What's going on up here?
[363:05.34]Who's up here?
[363:05.84]Out of the damn way!
[363:10.58]Why don't you just leave?
[363:13.16]Just minding my own business.
[363:18.61]How about I send some lead your way?
[363:21.17]Hey, shut it.
[364:14.38]I look over at chat and people are just like... Wait, is this... It's not even my horse!
[364:24.95]Now apparently, whose horse is this?
[364:32.33]Easy there.
[364:34.48]You done good, girl.
[364:35.90]Okay.
[364:39.40]Oh, it must be this guy's horse.
[364:46.92]Eat him!
[364:48.56]Alright, I'm getting off.
[365:01.97]Go free!
[365:02.53]No, no!
[365:20.44]Holy shit!
[365:25.75]I didn't kill that horse.
[365:27.85]I did not kill that horse.
[365:29.73]Do not put that blame on me.
[365:30.95]I have nothing to do with it.
[365:34.99]He just fell off.
[365:42.03]Zeus, you've angered Zeus.
[365:51.96]that's like one of my favorite things that anyone has said okay I got money welcome back mister I will take five ten fifteen hundred dollars
[366:18.03]I'm gonna have so much money.
[366:29.57]I'm gonna- I'm a millionaire now.
[366:31.32]That's a lot of fucking money.
[366:32.16]It really is.
[366:34.62]Okay, uh, some of these can be used in crafting and I want to get rid of them.
[366:45.51]Okay, we're good?
[366:48.43]Uh, alright.
[366:49.33]$2300.
[366:49.79]I'm gonna go back to camp, I'm gonna donate some money.
[367:21.68]Oh, just another random animal that just ran in the way.
[367:23.47]Whoops.
[367:24.35]Sorry.
[367:32.81]I'm just gonna give 500 bucks to the camp.
[367:39.47]Buy stock in Nintendo.
[367:40.77]Nintendo was established in 1889.
[367:42.09]What a weird company, huh?
[368:04.67]What percent is the game?
[368:06.33]Let's see.
[368:08.41]It is... Well, I probably have to go to progress rather than story.
[368:13.26]21% of the story.
[368:17.88]I haven't done anything.
[368:18.88]I've just been having so much fun dicking around, doing other random things.
[368:30.97]Yeah, this is 6, 12, 8, this is just about 18, 20 hours into the game.
[368:38.96]And I've just been doing whatever the hell I feel like, you know?
[368:51.25]Oh!
[368:54.23]Good save.
[368:59.48]There's no way around this.
[369:01.18]Wait.
[369:07.68]Ah, shit.
[369:08.08]The sunset's gone.
[369:10.38]I promised that was not intentional.
[369:11.99]I fucking promised.
[369:13.33]I was trying to get, like, a picture of the sunset.
[369:17.71]Okay, then.
[369:31.72]A lot of value.
[369:33.46]Oh yeah.
[369:38.61]I feel like I have barely scratched the surface.
[369:41.57]Tons of side content.
[369:43.13]Things I haven't even attempted to start.
[369:44.53]I just spent two hours tracking down a treasure.
[369:50.72]One of them.
[369:51.44]One treasure.
[370:00.56]There are some games that release that after 5-10 hours of full game content, you're just like, ah, this is dumb, I don't want to play this anymore.
[370:17.87]When a game's side content is more interesting than a lot of current game's main content, you know that this is a great experience.
[370:32.25]I mean, that's just very obvious and plain thing to say, right?
[370:38.83]Evening, Arthur.
[370:40.27]We keep heading east.
[370:41.37]Is that the plan?
[370:42.07]No, let me do this stuff first, though.
[370:43.19]When do we stop?
[370:44.19]When we reach Paris?
[370:45.73]I guess I can't do anything.
[370:46.87]During the commune, we stop when we find someplace sensible.
[370:50.98]Shake them that's following us and lie low.
[370:53.62]This is lying low?
[370:56.22]The camp is $46, and they're about to have way more.
[370:58.66]We ain't even got the delusion of being anything but a bunch of killers.
[371:01.39]Are we about to leave?
[371:02.05]You're just trying to survive, Hosea.
[371:05.58]We don't have a choice.
[371:07.34]This will end soon.
[371:08.24]Are we all torn down right now?
[371:09.28]Damn right it will.
[371:11.02]Constipated as usual.
[371:14.38]Where's my shaving kit?
[371:20.43]Do I not have my shaving kit right here?
[371:28.17]Um... What?
[371:32.12]Okay.
[371:37.04]Wasn't there a shaving kit right next to my bed?
[371:43.76]Should be in the barrel?
[371:44.58]Yeah.
[371:45.32]Well, I guess not.
[371:51.39]Change clothes.
[371:52.13]Let me do that, too.
[371:55.37]It's moving time.
[371:56.39]I need something that looks better with these clothes.
[372:04.40]Oh, that looks all right.
[372:12.01]Okay.
[372:13.66]Uh... Suspenders.
[372:20.91]Coats.
[372:27.95]That's the one he had in the beginning of the game.
[372:30.92]That's not bad.
[372:42.37]Vests.
[372:52.12]None of the outfits look any good.
[372:53.42]It's like dressing up a Ken doll.
[372:57.51]Okay.
[373:04.65]Why do you think that?
[373:08.14]What the fuck are those pants?
[373:09.24]These are Legendary Ram pants, by the way.
[373:12.22]I got these off of Legendary Ram.
[373:15.20]I'm never taking them off.
[373:27.09]By the way... I guess I can't do anything.
[373:32.62]I have to talk to Dutch.
[373:33.98]I think we're leaving.
[373:34.70]I think we're setting up shop somewhere else.
[373:37.46]So, let's just get it over with.
[373:39.01]Yeah.
[373:47.66]okay maybe you and charles can go take a look clear off anyone you find before the whole lot of us move in looking so conspicuous and now we're gonna do that I don't have ads no start dancing I turned into a goddamn errand boy you have turned into my son I don't run ahead because I worry we are just the same you might get one when you load the page up but that doesn't have anything to do with me running I need you for something now where have I heard that before
[374:26.86]Let's go, I guess.
[374:28.02]This is kinda sad.
[374:28.82]I was just starting to like this place.
[374:30.54]I guess so.
[374:58.52]We're not moving very far.
[374:59.64]Well, they know where we are, so, well, we gotta get out of here.
[375:03.51]They're looking for us and trying to get rid of us.
[375:06.43]How about down the street?
[375:24.45]They'll never see it coming.
[375:25.87]Not even a hundred feet, but we'll be fine.
[375:27.69]That's pretty far with only one horsepower.
[375:29.48]This is not a safe route.
[375:31.74]Good thing I jumped.
[375:54.69]Who?
[376:08.41]Why are you riding off on me?
[376:10.21]I thought this guy just said, hey, wait for me.
[376:15.12]I'm only known him a few months, but the way he talks, I never thought I'd see him wanting to head south.
[376:22.42]Arthur's voice acting did a great job.
[376:24.18]I think they're all good.
[376:25.66]They're all great.
[376:26.78]There's too many of us for that.
[376:29.76]His top-notch acting, top-notch voice work all around.
[376:33.20]Good stuff.
[376:34.34]Goes against everything he stands for.
[376:37.06]That'd be admitting we're nothing more than blowdown criminals.
[376:41.29]Which we are.
[376:43.21]You don't have to tell me.
[376:45.33]So where does it end?
[376:46.79]Where does what end?
[376:47.97]The moving, the running.
[376:50.01]Dutch don't see it as running.
[376:52.26]Call it what you want.
[376:53.76]I don't know.
[376:55.28]Hey, there it is.
[376:56.88]Put enough time and distance, but hang on a second.
[377:00.90]I think that must be it up ahead, the old dried up creek.
[377:05.01]Seems very open.
[377:17.59]Lot lot, I didn't know it was that much of a fault.
[377:20.08]That was, that was on purpose.
[377:21.52]You're right.
[377:22.54]That was on purpose.
[377:23.26]I did not think that was gonna instantly kill me.
[377:26.16]I thought I was gonna be able to land it.
[377:27.12]Didn't think it was that much of a fault.
[377:29.30]Oh, for the love of God.
[377:30.19]The same thing happened to me?
[377:33.37]You did the same thing?
[377:34.65]See?
[377:42.75]I just tried to jump the gap.
[377:44.89]It wasn't that high.
[377:45.69]It just instantly faceplant killed me.
[377:51.40]This is what you get for rushing and not letting them talk.
[377:54.94]You're right.
[377:55.54]You know?
[377:56.28]You know what?
[377:58.68]You're right.
[377:59.92]You're absolutely right.
[378:02.62]You're right.
[378:02.94]Let's pay attention.
[378:03.36]I'm holding X. That's supposed to be going in the right.
[378:05.48]It's just... Hey, wait up!
[378:31.29]Where did he go?
[378:33.37]I thought if you held X in cinematic mode it just took you the right way.
[378:35.77]Wait, why?
[378:37.55]I would-
[378:54.61]Who died?
[378:55.13]Somebody died?
[378:55.84]Who was killed?
[378:57.36]Okay, this is the road.
[378:58.12]Here we go, cinematic mode.
[378:59.50]There.
[378:59.66]Holding it.
[379:10.75]And I know by now there ain't no lying low.
[379:14.67]There's too many of us for that.
[379:16.99]And there ain't no way Dutch is gonna just hide away in a cave somewhere.
[379:21.00]This is why we're at 21%.
[379:22.20]Goes against everything he stands for.
[379:24.96]That'd be admitting we're nothing more than low-down criminals.
[379:29.16]Which we are.
[379:31.09]You don't have to tell me.
[379:33.23]So where does it end?
[379:34.73]Where does what end?
[379:36.09]The moving, the running.
[379:37.95]Dutch don't see it as running.
[379:40.17]Call it what you want.
[379:41.67]I don't know.
[379:43.17]Before, put enough time and distance between you and the problem, eventually it went away.
[379:51.10]No, I'm not holding it.
[379:54.04]I just double tapped it.
[379:55.90]Is it going the right way?
[379:59.24]Yes, we're going the right way.
[380:03.04]Okay.
[380:03.94]Let's take over.
[380:04.78]I'm getting antsy.
[380:05.30]Okay.
[380:39.15]How does he know?
[380:40.35]How does he know?
[380:41.57]Alright, give me some slack.
[380:43.77]Wait a second.
[380:45.21]That's what I jumped off of, guys.
[380:47.90]From that far.
[380:48.48]That's enough for me to faceplant and die?
[380:49.80]That's how far the jump was.
[381:08.56]Give me some slack.
[381:09.58]What do you mean, no, it wasn't?
[381:11.26]Yes, it was.
[381:11.78]Not again.
[381:15.80]He's been shot.
[381:22.20]Let's be careful out there.
[381:28.41]Hmm.
[381:33.32]I'm just kidding.
[381:35.86]It's a joke.
[381:36.14]You really have to do that?
[381:38.10]You don't need him now.
[382:02.84]This guy really is just chat.
[382:07.70]He's just like, again, really?
[382:09.02]You fell off the fucking horse?
[382:10.62]You really have to do that right now?
[382:11.64]Like, you're in the middle of a mission, dude.
[382:18.23]Where is everybody?
[382:19.07]Maybe they heard us come.
[382:22.57]Be careful.
[382:23.93]I'm being careful.
[382:33.49]Nobody here you smell something Someone's been here sure Someone's still here.
[382:54.12]There ain't no one here now.
[382:56.54]I'm so sure about that I
[383:30.88]Don't shoot us.
[383:35.68]We didn't do anything.
[383:36.52]We tried to save you.
[383:53.32]That was great.
[383:55.70]He said, are you okay?
[383:58.12]He's playing the Dutch?
[383:59.72]Uh-oh.
[384:00.44]It's German?
[384:03.15]No.
[384:03.65]Language barrier.
[384:05.57]Get out of here.
[384:06.47]Go.
[384:06.73]We need the land.
[384:07.59]Go.
[384:09.67]Get the hell out of here.
[384:11.09]They took our father.
[384:12.79]Who did?
[384:13.89]Men.
[384:14.58]Last night.
[384:15.30]Where?
[384:16.65]Where did they take him?
[384:17.89]Ain't no business of ours.
[384:19.92]I don't even speak their language.
[384:22.00]You ain't as tough and dense as all that.
[384:24.44]Come on, Arthur.
[384:31.22]The girl was pointing this way.
[384:33.10]Let's see if we can pick up a trail.
[384:38.54]And you guys get mad when I, like, throw somebody in a fire, kick somebody in the face.
[384:49.47]That's who I'm playing with, guys.
[384:51.22]He's a bad man.
[384:52.14]He's a bad man.
[384:58.04]Stop in front of me man
[385:29.61]Okay, looks like they go down this way.
[385:34.32]Oh, there's a track.
[385:35.54]What happened with those Pinkertons anyway?
[385:38.08]When you were fishing with Jack?
[385:39.56]Said they were onto us.
[385:42.25]Offered me freedom if I turned Dutch, yeah.
[385:45.83]They picked the wrong man there.
[385:48.12]We should have moved right then if you asked me.
[385:51.74]Bastards told me they killed Mac.
[385:54.38]I said it right in front of Jack.
[385:56.68]Wait, let me make sure this is right.
[386:01.69]This is not right, man.
[386:02.67]Where are you leading us?
[386:03.83]Wrong.
[386:07.79]Where are you leading us, man?
[386:11.14]Continues along the shore here.
[386:19.14]Just talking about something.
[386:23.24]Hey, we don't need to announce our arrival.
[386:27.41]That kid, it's gonna be tough for him.
[386:31.69]Yeah, but he has more folk looking out for him than most of the rest of us had growing up.
[386:43.22]There was a fucking monster in the water.
[386:46.40]John said he was going back to the auction yard to collect the money for those sheep.
[386:51.95]He'd be a dead man.
[386:56.43]Come here!
[386:58.25]He ain't going anywhere near that town right now.
[387:02.67]He reckoned he'd be able to slip in and out.
[387:05.65]Oh, well.
[387:07.57]Easy!
[387:07.97]It's God's idea.
[387:08.97]It must be a good one.
[387:10.25]The monster is you.
[387:10.81]What is it with you and him?
[387:12.41]Well, he disappeared on us for a while.
[387:17.55]Wait a second.
[387:18.27]Just want to look closer here.
[387:22.41]What?
[387:23.27]Let God sort him out.
[387:32.14]They carry on along this trail.
[387:37.70]Should I have not hitched my horse?
[387:39.11]Oh, well...
[388:25.39]What was I talking about?
[388:27.35]Oh.
[388:28.27]When Jack was real young.
[388:30.31]A long while.
[388:31.31]A year ago.
[388:33.51]Hey, quiet now.
[388:35.21]Let's camp up ahead.
[388:36.56]Be careful.
[388:38.92]Easy.
[388:40.02]Seems deserted.
[388:41.80]Let's take a look.
[388:51.24]You guys make me do it.
[389:01.10]where is this guy I don't know but you know something this is a better camp spot than back there much easier to defend we make you yeah like one person in chat said shoot him this 2300 people here like point zero point zero point two percent of everybody said let's get out of here
[389:27.17]I see three coming this way Doesn't look like it
[390:18.69]Well, that's them dealt with.
[390:20.57]You get him untied, and I'll see what they've left behind for us.
[390:29.06]Hard-scoping.
[390:29.94]It's okay.
[390:30.74]I'm getting you out of here.
[390:38.67]Vielen Dank für Ihre Hilfe.
[390:40.29]Yeah, okay.
[390:42.47]Okay, you wait there a second.
[390:44.49]Charles!
[390:45.84]Alright, I got my crazy up.
[390:51.14]I'm not gonna kill anybody, not gonna attack anybody.
[390:55.59]That's done with.
[390:56.19]It's over with.
[390:57.65]Every, like, 30 minutes or so.
[391:00.45]Then I'll have to do a random, insane thing.
[391:04.13]So, not anymore.
[391:05.95]Now we're gonna be good.
[391:06.51]Remember when I gave that guy the money?
[391:08.47]Remember when I helped that lady?
[391:23.10]No, it's gonna be fine.
[391:35.57]I got my own hat.
[391:36.23]I got the one that I paid for.
[391:48.63]When I killed the sea monster?
[391:50.55]That guy's already dead, doesn't he?
[391:52.49]I'm very suburbia.
[391:53.63]I do.
[391:53.83]Unfortunately, I do.
[392:20.45]What the hell did you do to those fellas?
[392:24.51]Those men back there, why did they take you?
[392:28.71]Gold mining.
[392:30.49]How did someone even come up with them words?
[392:33.31]What did you say?
[392:35.55]Look, I'm sorry, friend.
[392:36.85]I can barely speak English.
[393:00.26]I wonder if I get another gold bar.
[393:01.96]I need to go kill the bear?
[393:12.31]Yeah, sounds good enough.
[393:20.45]I'll kill the bear.
[393:29.43]Gold.
[393:30.57]Bar.
[393:31.31]Play.
[393:56.21]I guess it was a pleasure.
[393:58.51]I probably got more gold than he does at this point.
[394:31.78]No, you don't?
[394:32.60]What do you mean, no, I don't?
[394:35.66]You were right.
[394:36.80]This place ought to be perfect for us.
[394:39.84]Hello, Arthur.
[394:47.48]Miss Grimshaw, Mr. Pearson, put everyone to work.
[394:51.96]Make this place a home.
[394:54.13]Well, I don't know where the hell we are, but we are going to make the best of it.
[395:02.28]Cool.
[395:03.05]Oh, don't drop.
[395:03.73]New desk.
[395:04.53]Don't do that.
[395:05.07]Tap three.
[395:15.97]Cool.
[395:20.68]A few days later.
[395:38.73]Bandit challenge.
[395:41.67]It's a bandit challenge.
[395:50.46]I just was trying to turn over a new leaf and now they're making me rob people?
[395:53.22]Alright, well, let's go to the coffers here.
[396:07.70]So, let's contribute.
[396:13.63]Give some money.
[396:16.23]I'm going to give $500. $500.
[396:42.89]500.
[396:42.91]5-0.
[396:42.95]And now, let's take a look at the ledger.
[396:57.42]Hey, thanks for the donation.
[396:58.22]I really appreciate it.
[397:02.48]What can we do here?
[397:03.78]We got...
[397:07.07]Let's have some fun.
[397:07.75]Fire bottles and high velocity repeater ammo.
[397:12.85]Yes, please.
[397:20.11]Shave?
[397:20.49]Well, I couldn't shave last time because we were about to move.
[397:28.16]We'll buy the fast travelers will be now available.
[397:34.96]Not gonna use it.
[397:36.08]How did I get so much money?
[397:38.68]I did a treasure hunt for about two hours.
[397:42.78]And found three gold bars.
[397:46.42]Improved the rest of the tents in the camp.
[397:52.02]I wonder if I should just do that.
[397:52.98]Just get it over with and get it.
[397:59.41]Everybody's camp has been upgraded.
[398:00.71]The overall mood of the camp has improved.
[398:11.03]Alright.
[398:15.65]Oh dear, alright, so now we got... Met a traveller selling an old boat.
[398:20.24]Useful.
[398:20.60]Are you sure he wasn't dead?
[398:25.25]That looks very familiar.
[398:40.04]I want to take that out right now.
[398:41.08]I have so much money.
[398:46.95]This is what happens when you make a lot of money.
[398:49.25]Isn't it?
[398:49.55]Like, I'm just buying everything, and I just need to stop.
[398:55.90]Okay, um...
[399:09.50]Let's give them a little bit of money, though.
[399:10.98]So they can have some cash on hand.
[399:18.27]Give, like, 30 or 40 bucks.
[399:20.33]Just so they can have stuff.
[399:29.38]What?
[399:31.16]Buy food?
[399:31.80]What?
[399:31.90]I...
[399:38.67]I just spent like $1,000 on the camp and now everyone's upset about me giving them $30 of spending money?
[399:51.37]Medicine.
[399:52.23]Tonics and premium liquor.
[399:53.45]Just buy it.
[400:11.36]There's no reason for me to restock that because it's already full.
[400:15.28]So this is provisions.
[400:16.16]Chewing tobacco and premium canned goods.
[400:18.11]Do it.
[400:34.55]So I don't need to restock them.
[400:36.30]Why is everybody freaking out about the restocking?
[400:37.90]I'm upgrading and it restocks as I upgrade.
[400:41.49]Because I can't even... It's grayed out now because I upgraded it.
[400:45.42]You know what I'm saying?
[400:49.44]The good stuff.
[400:49.94]Potent health cures and tonics.
[400:51.32]I mean, have the money.
[400:54.74]Just have it all.
[401:00.58]Upgrades are expensive.
[401:01.30]You could have spent that money on pretty clothes.
[401:07.93]Vanity versus necessity.
[401:10.91]I'm going to be good to go.
[401:12.73]For a long time.
[401:13.97]And I'm going to buy them fucking sweets.
[401:20.22]We're going to be stocked up and decked out forever.
[401:22.46]What else we got?
[401:35.88]Oh.
[401:36.40]What's that?
[401:37.02]We need like a place for horses?
[401:39.48]I'll take care of it.
[401:52.87]Anything else that we need?
[401:57.13]Where did I take care of everything?
[402:00.73]Oh, that's right.
[402:01.45]Took care of everything.
[402:09.37]$240 for sticks.
[402:12.15]Hey, if... Back in the 1800s, it was hard to put... They didn't have screws.
[402:19.15]Oh, what...
[402:29.06]Sticks and rope.
[402:34.21]Where are you gonna get the rope?
[402:49.14]At the rope store.
[402:51.68]Go get rope at the rope store.
[402:56.52]Oh.
[402:57.54]That's where you get the rope.
[402:59.89]Alright, I'm done with the chores.
[403:06.85]So, uh, here are the... This is where you can put the horses, right here.
[403:16.52]So now... Horse station.
[403:22.44]Oh, okay, this is cool.
[403:23.42]So this is like a stables.
[403:24.28]Alright, let's bring out Whisper.
[403:36.56]He's upset.
[403:37.56]Now make yourself useful.
[403:38.94]And the first part of useful is not driving me insane.
[403:41.76]Hey, get that horse out of here.
[403:42.94]It's all good.
[403:43.60]Calm down.
[403:44.18]I ain't complaining.
[403:45.14]You are.
[403:46.82]Complain, complain.
[403:47.68]What's the problem?
[403:51.49]Say whatever you damn well please, but I tell you, if I don't get out of here soon, I'm going to kill somebody.
[403:56.85]And if you don't stop hitting, I'm going to kill you.
[404:02.08]You come near me, sailor, and I'll slice you up.
[404:05.10]You put that knife down or you could be missing a hand.
[404:07.82]What is wrong with you two?
[404:09.65]I ain't chopping vegetables for a living.
[404:13.05]Oh, I'm sorry, madam.
[404:14.65]Was there insufficient feathers in your pillow?
[404:17.13]I ain't lazy, Mr. Morgan.
[404:18.97]I'll work, but not this.
[404:20.70]Well, ain't cooking work?
[404:29.32]Don't look like Trevor from GTA.
[404:31.36]My husband and I, we shared the work.
[404:34.32]All of it.
[404:35.76]I was out in the fields.
[404:37.32]I can hunt, carry a knife, or use a gun.
[404:40.77]But I tell you, you keep me here, I'll skin this fat old coot and serve him for dinner!
[404:46.05]Watch your damn mouth, you crazy goddamn fishwife!
[404:48.93]Enough!
[404:49.90]Both of you!
[404:52.68]Well, come with me then.
[404:54.63]You want to head out there?
[404:55.75]Run with the men?
[404:57.66]Remember the village people?
[404:59.06]So be it.
[405:00.10]But we do more than just hunting.
[405:01.74]What?
[405:02.26]We're hunted.
[405:04.18]And them things hunting us, well, they got guns of their own.
[405:06.96]It's the pants.
[405:07.64]I ain't afraid of dying.
[405:10.85]Good.
[405:13.13]You need anything, Mr. Pearson?
[405:15.95]Maybe me and Mrs. Add are going to take a little ride.
[405:18.49]Can we go in the boat instead?
[405:19.43]I just bought it.
[405:20.43]Sure.
[405:21.84]Here's my list, and can you post this letter for me while you're there?
[405:26.92]Sure.
[405:27.78]Come on, princess.
[405:31.19]Are you coming with me then, woman?
[405:34.31]I'm also underweight.
[405:37.53]Emma, I'm underweight.
[405:38.29]So I've graduated from chopping vegetables to shopping.
[405:41.71]My artery's really skinny.
[405:43.43]I need to get fatter then.
[405:56.69]I really haven't been eating anything, you're right.
[406:01.30]Check your weight in the pause menu.
[406:07.36]What would it be under?
[406:15.62]Underweight.
[406:26.48]You need to be snacking constantly.
[406:28.72]Well, it's hard to find provisions.
[406:30.86]I guess we all gotta do our share, princess.
[406:35.05]Where's the letter?
[406:36.39]Are you reading his mail now?
[406:38.55]Oh, robbing and killing's okay, but letter reading's where we draw the line.
[406:43.81]There.
[406:46.76]Need more peanut butter?
[406:48.58]No, I'm good.
[406:49.50]Dear Aunt Kathy...
[406:53.70]I haven't heard from you in some time.
[406:56.86]So I pray to the Lord above that your health has not deteriorated further.
[407:03.12]Blah, blah, blah.
[407:05.24]This is boring.
[407:08.59]Wait a sec.
[407:09.57]Listen to this.
[407:11.67]Since we last corresponded, I have traveled widely, making no small name for myself.
[407:19.04]Well, not anymore.
[407:20.76]When she was doing the deeper voice, it was.
[407:22.94]I am still yet to take a wife, but I can assure you it's not for a lack of suitors.
[407:30.99]You ever actually even talk to a woman he ain't paid for?
[407:35.21]Oh, look.
[407:36.57]We're all hiding behind something.
[407:38.99]And what's this?
[407:41.01]Return to Tacitus Kilgore.
[407:43.77]Oh, that?
[407:44.80]That's Dutch's idea.
[407:46.76]All males are sent to the same alien.
[407:48.88]That was a pretty good move.
[407:50.00]Whenever we set up somewhere new... In front of that old lady driver.
[407:53.00]Doesn't it start expecting males from Tacitus Kilgore or whatever they changed it to?
[408:01.66]Here, give me that bag.
[408:03.74]We got work to do.
[408:04.49]Alright, let's load up the groceries on our errand run.
[408:12.04]How much longer am I going to stream for?
[408:13.34]I don't know.
[408:14.18]I'm still filming, still having fun.
[408:16.08]I'm probably... What is she doing?
[408:17.64]Look at that nice gun.
[408:36.45]she's definitely gonna hold the place up and I'm gonna run out here and she's done she's gonna do something crazy she's gonna do like a jeremy in there and accidentally shoot three people and then fall down on her horse just watch
[409:04.34]Nothing.
[409:05.20]What do you mean nothing?
[409:06.72]What's in the park?
[409:17.73]Oh, dear.
[409:18.95]Looked for some mail.
[409:19.73]Did I just... Did somebody just take money from me?
[409:26.75]I bumped into that guy and my money went... Did my money go down?
[409:41.11]You're lucky that I'm on fucking restriction right now.
[409:45.23]Can I help you, mister?
[409:52.26]Yes, I would like to post a letter.
[409:55.00]All right.
[409:55.38]Send some mail.
[409:57.10]Okay, no trouble.
[409:57.86]Thank you.
[409:58.24]Bye now.
[409:58.54]See you soon.
[410:13.91]That's a nice beard you got.
[410:15.65]Hey, fellas.
[410:17.01]Hello.
[410:19.74]Nice people around here.
[410:25.86]Can you believe I just heard one of them?
[410:28.38]Nice day.
[410:30.32]Sir, good morning.
[410:31.28]I swear, this place is good.
[410:33.80]Forgive me.
[410:35.18]No, no.
[410:36.02]I got no proof.
[410:36.90]Get a haircut.
[410:48.36]Come on, just like 90s comedy movie me, please.
[410:55.14]Whatever.
[410:56.90]Did you hurry up already?
[410:58.58]I'm working.
[410:59.16]What is taking you so long?
[411:01.43]Listen lady, I got it all in the wagon there.
[411:04.05]I could train my goat to do this faster.
[411:12.44]Okay, get on.
[411:13.90]I think this is everything.
[411:15.38]Thanks.
[411:16.22]Here.
[411:17.28]Take that for yourself, okay?
[411:19.64]Ooh, nice catch.
[411:20.54]Thanks.
[411:21.56]Well, give it back then.
[411:23.28]Jesus.
[411:24.86]I didn't ask for his goddamn help.
[411:28.08]Why don't you drive?
[411:29.45]Okay.
[411:30.43]Come on, lady.
[411:31.43]Get a move on.
[411:32.59]I like Sadie, not lady.
[411:35.73]I know.
[411:38.71]So, you get everything?
[411:40.87]I think so.
[411:42.66]And some new clothes, I see.
[411:45.42]Don't start.
[411:46.40]I was going to say, is this the same lady?
[411:49.57]Well, I'm not driving, so I can scream at people out the window.
[411:53.29]I wasn't some little wife with a flower in her hair, baking cherry pies all day.
[411:58.33]Yeah, I don't doubt that.
[412:01.66]You sure looked the part now.
[412:04.18]Such a door map?
[412:05.54]What?
[412:05.74]That's him.
[412:26.55]You know.
[412:26.91]Is that him?
[412:27.61]That is him.
[412:29.21]Maybe I'll keep my eye out for... Another one.
[412:33.16]I don't want no pity.
[412:33.86]Put the gun down.
[412:34.88]Just treat me equal and know nobody's taking... Nothing from me ever again.
[412:47.98]Mm-hmm.
[412:50.24]Just don't kill the camp cook.
[412:52.98]Please.
[412:55.20]Giddy up!
[412:56.62]Pull over.
[412:59.02]Pull over.
[413:36.19]Why would you get off the horse?
[413:40.79]What the hell?
[413:42.45]Why are they getting off of the horses?
[414:28.55]What's going on?
[414:30.13]What, I can't, like, run around and stab people?
[414:58.94]it got angry she died okay I can't have any fun during this mission apparently all right let's just do it behind me near those rocks
[415:33.86]I killed the guy you were shooting at.
[415:35.30]Fucking destroyed that guy.
[415:38.43]Literally ruined that guy.
[416:02.24]Oh, pass those reins here.
[416:04.70]Why?
[416:05.40]Because you've caused enough trouble already.
[416:08.87]I'm fine.
[416:10.17]I shot him in the back.
[416:11.93]I shot him in the back of the head.
[416:14.75]Remind me not to get on your backside.
[416:16.73]He probably saw the bullet go into his face.
[416:19.57]It's perfect.
[416:20.65]Did good.
[416:22.33]But that's a lot of mess to make near camp.
[416:25.75]Hope it don't bring anyone sniffing around.
[416:28.96]Are you going to tell Dutch?
[416:30.94]Maybe, if he asks.
[416:33.98]But maybe not.
[416:36.84]I think you're going the wrong way.
[416:38.84]Hey, you want me to drive?
[416:43.39]Yeah, something like that.
[416:45.23]Who knows?
[416:46.43]Can we pick up the pace here?
[416:50.11]Anyway, don't you go ribbing Pierce about that letter.
[416:54.13]How dare you?
[416:55.19]Oh.
[416:57.04]What is with these directions?
[416:58.24]I was going the right way!
[417:01.72]Apparently I was going the right way, and now we're going the wrong- okay.
[417:04.38]What's Sadie drives?
[417:05.12]I think something's wrong.
[417:26.17]I think the remote is broken.
[417:27.29]They're not going anymore.
[417:41.36]I don't have control over this!
[417:44.76]It's automatically doing this.
[417:45.66]You didn't get yourself killed then, Miss Adler.
[417:48.07]Not quite.
[417:49.21]Well, I'd like to say I missed your refined conversations, but I'd be lying.
[417:55.97]I enjoyed myself out there.
[417:57.91]Yes, we, uh, Mrs. Adler did okay.
[418:01.16]At shopping?
[418:01.94]Yes, at shopping.
[418:03.40]Thank you, Mr. Morgan.
[418:04.84]Isn't Micah still... Micah's still down.
[418:06.62]Like 12 hours ago.
[418:32.06]Alright, it's time for the boat.
[418:32.82]I want to get on the boat.
[418:34.72]Spend all the money on it.
[418:35.46]Ooh, coffee.
[418:41.18]I'll have some.
[418:44.71]Who's making all the noise?
[418:49.91]That's just loud.
[419:04.23]Hey, where's my boat?
[419:14.18]You doing all right?
[419:17.34]I just dumped the rest out.
[419:18.32]Why?
[419:19.04]Yeah, seems to get worse for today.
[419:26.01]Shave?
[419:27.29]I will after the boat trip.
[419:32.76]How you doing, old friend?
[419:36.81]I don't see a boat.
[419:38.23]Oh, there it is.
[419:38.67]Is he...
[419:45.49]you following me oh god see I'm boring you arthur we lost men back there I'm trying to have lofty goals arthur we're trying to reform society to a kinder truer better way now of course there's gonna be casualties
[420:07.44]We're thieves in a world that don't want us no more.
[420:11.44]We are dreamers in an ever duller world of facts.
[420:16.85]Now, I'll give you that, but come on.
[420:20.41]We got the day.
[420:22.69]It's nice out.
[420:23.65]Can you get in here?
[420:25.11]Old Jose says there's a trick around here.
[420:27.06]Can you just get in here, though?
[420:28.90]I reckon it's worth it.
[420:31.80]Just get in here.
[421:14.47]Go on.
[421:14.93]Let's go.
[421:15.33]Go on.
[421:16.35]Show me.
[421:22.27]Tie him to the boat.
[421:39.87]Shave.
[421:40.87]I haven't had an opportunity to.
[421:47.05]Let's go flat.
[421:48.90]Just go fishing?
[421:50.76]Dutchie's saying we're going to go fishing.
[421:59.99]I'm just in a boat.
[422:01.15]He couldn't have gotten in that one.
[422:08.79]Why don't we just fish here?
[422:10.51]There's a whole lake of them.
[422:11.79]That's what I said.
[422:12.49]Because I need to get out for a bit.
[422:15.13]Me and the old guard.
[422:17.05]Before any of them back there.
[422:19.87]There was us.
[422:21.53]The curious couple and their unruly son.
[422:24.93]It feels good here.
[422:26.81]You did well finding that spot, Arthur.
[422:30.09]More Charles than me.
[422:31.71]I double tapped it.
[422:35.01]Thick and soupy as this air is.
[422:38.06]Might even do your whistling pipes some good, Jose.
[422:41.48]I was once in this country with Bessie.
[422:43.38]Is there a reason why you're stopping?
[422:44.86]That feels like a lifetime ago.
[422:47.40]It was a lifetime ago.
[422:49.91]But what a life we have lived.
[422:51.65]How well we have fought.
[422:53.61]Especially both of you.
[422:54.73]I hope so.
[422:56.81]But now, when things are desperate, we have to stick with the plan.
[423:12.28]I thought we were going fishing.
[423:13.66]Open your eyes!
[423:15.60]Now as I was saying, if you make enough money, then find us somewhere.
[423:20.88]Nobody will find us.
[423:23.06]But we don't have to hide.
[423:25.38]Like where?
[423:26.76]I got some ideas hatching.
[423:29.00]But I need you with me, not against me.
[423:32.99]That one was on purpose.
[423:35.35]Call me up for it.
[423:36.38]That one wasn't though!
[423:50.63]That one was not.
[423:51.69]I was just doing the cinematic camera holding S. I'm freezing.
[423:58.20]I did a 1080 snowboarding move.
[424:08.46]All right, we get it.
[424:09.85]I'm not making a joke, I promise.
[424:12.57]Did you see what the camera angle was there?
[424:15.35]We've got to be discreet.
[424:17.23]Imagine what a slew of rich simpletons there must be down here.
[424:22.43]Oh, this is perfect for you, Hosea.
[424:25.90]You'll be able to play them like a fiddle.
[424:28.90]Nothing would give me greater pleasure but no butts.
[424:32.76]Not today.
[424:34.46]We fish and we enjoy the day.
[424:38.05]We're just acting like it never happens.
[424:49.46]That's why these games are so much fun, man.
[424:53.46]It's never not funny.
[424:54.56]That would hurt.
[425:11.45]How are you, boys?
[425:12.93]Fine.
[425:14.27]This is quite some country you have here.
[425:16.87]We like it well enough.
[425:19.30]Cody McIntosh, at your service.
[425:22.30]Lee Gray.
[425:23.56]This is my deputy, Archibald McGregor.
[425:26.32]It's good to meet you.
[425:27.78]You a Scot?
[425:29.10]Partly.
[425:30.77]The best part.
[425:33.16]Of course.
[425:34.22]Now, tell me, sir, what did the silly, fancy fop back there do?
[425:39.23]Nothing too terrible, I trust.
[425:40.81]He was accused of running a gold mining investment scam.
[425:44.33]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[425:45.49]I'm sure he wasn't.
[425:47.39]He is a magician.
[425:48.67]I know him.
[425:49.61]He's a fool.
[425:51.18]But he is not a bad fella.
[425:53.02]Now, can we... The founder of Baltimore.
[425:55.26]Can we just... I wouldn't do that if I were you.
[425:58.24]Shit!
[425:59.26]The Anderson boys.
[426:00.66]I can't have more scandal.
[426:03.82]Well, allow us to help, my friend.
[426:06.18]Arthur!
[426:07.10]Chase wanted, man.
[426:08.92]And take Archibald with you.
[426:10.95]Just what I signed up for.
[426:12.65]Come on, big guy.
[426:14.23]Perhaps we can discuss the foolish magician.
[426:17.09]Stay with that train.
[426:18.67]Don't let them get away.
[426:20.57]And do not shoot them, you hear me?
[426:22.91]I'm not going to shoot anybody.
[426:24.90]All right.
[426:25.64]Come on, we're losing them.
[426:27.64]Will you relax?
[426:28.84]We're not losing them.
[426:30.73]That's a great thing, man.
[426:31.63]We're close.
[426:31.99]How close do I need to be?
[426:34.31]Boop.
[427:03.74]What happened there?
[427:13.81]What?
[427:14.79]Did I step on the edge of the road?
[427:16.79]Come on, big guy.
[427:18.34]Perhaps we can discuss the foolish magician.
[427:21.46]Let's go after that train.
[427:24.13]And do not shoot them.
[427:25.51]You hear me?
[427:26.69]Come on.
[427:27.25]Hurry.
[427:28.49]All right.
[427:29.31]Come on.
[427:29.89]We're losing them.
[427:31.01]Oh, we had to follow the train.
[427:32.87]That's right.
[427:34.83]Faster.
[427:35.52]Come on.
[427:36.66]What's your name, sir?
[427:38.26]Arthur.
[427:39.28]Arthur Callahan.
[427:41.04]Faster, Mr. Callahan, please.
[427:43.18]My neck is on the line here.
[427:45.30]I get it.
[427:46.64]I'm doing my best.
[427:48.12]I think I got too close.
[427:49.04]I got too close to the train, I think.
[427:50.75]And then.
[427:54.41]No, did I not say that?
[427:56.85]You said 20.
[427:57.51]Yeah, I'm tapping next.
[427:59.41]I got too close.
[428:00.51]What are you waiting for?
[428:02.01]I'm out here.
[428:06.41]Idiot.
[428:07.44]Now get after the others.
[428:08.52]Come on.
[428:10.40]The train is slowing down to go through the station.
[428:12.64]Now's our chance.
[428:14.81]Get to the side of the train.
[428:17.17]Come on.
[428:20.07]Get alongside that flat carriage.
[428:23.37]You think you can jump on there?
[428:25.42]Hey, why me?
[428:26.98]Because you ride like my grandmother.
[428:29.66]Oh, shut up.
[428:30.28]What's that guy throwing?
[428:33.12]He's throwing rocks.
[428:43.48]I'm doing a really bad job of not killing them oh those damn anderson boys always up to no good pushing cows over spit spit balls
[429:08.19]Gosh darn it.
[429:09.73]What?
[429:37.88]Uh-oh, he's got a knife.
[429:38.76]I can't access my weapon wheel.
[430:02.89]Oh, he caught me.
[430:04.02]Oh, he caught me.
[430:04.60]He's cutting me up.
[430:05.66]Oh, she's cutting me.
[430:35.94]No, I'm not doing that over again No, my hat my hats in there
[431:04.01]I was going to just kick him in the head as hard as I could.
[431:05.89]Bring him out here.
[431:08.17]The hat's back.
[431:09.75]Sounded like quite a commotion.
[431:12.07]Is that him?
[431:13.27]I sincerely hope so.
[431:15.29]Old Anders Anderson.
[431:17.33]What now?
[431:18.24]Take him in.
[431:18.92]Come on.
[431:22.40]Fine job.
[431:23.26]Well done.
[431:24.60]And a pat on the back for me for stopping the train.
[431:27.90]There you go.
[431:32.02]You are a natural.
[431:35.17]Let's go then.
[431:42.17]I love how I found the thing that I can just never ending just fuck with you guys with.
[431:49.14]Every time I equip the shotgun everyone just goes, oh no.
[432:09.53]Where are we gonna go fishing?
[432:27.84]I love this game.
[432:28.46]I just can't stop playing this game.
[432:30.60]I can't stop just having fun.
[432:31.80]This is so fun.
[432:57.40]It really feels like you're a cowboy.
[432:58.92]The Dutch has asked the gang to not use weapons or cause any trouble in roads.
[433:30.46]Tell me what to do in the game that I purchased for $60.
[433:34.17]$80, sorry.
[433:39.91]Here we are.
[433:40.81]Welcome to Rhodes.
[433:43.51]Up there on your left is the Rhodes Parlor House.
[433:47.23]Very reputable saloon owned by the Gray family.
[433:51.09]We also have a general store, gunsmith, post office, train station, of course.
[433:57.23]Hi, guys.
[433:59.53]I've returned.
[434:00.69]These are strangers.
[434:01.38]I thought they were... Get the fuck out of the way.
[434:23.55]Sooner you get him off your horse, sooner we can get him in a cell.
[434:27.07]Just bring him here.
[434:30.97]Hey, fellas.
[434:33.87]Mr. Gray!
[434:35.44]We got him.
[434:35.82]Okay, if I didn't kill him, that did.
[434:37.48]I told you Arthur would deliver.
[434:39.30]Man has a passion for justice.
[434:40.92]That's wonderful.
[434:41.86]So, uh, about my friend here.
[434:43.78]Your idiot friend is free to go.
[434:45.72]But no more trouble from you, partner.
[434:47.66]I promise you, this was all just a big misunderstanding.
[434:52.22]However, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[434:55.66]I'll pretend to appreciate that.
[434:57.92]Mr. McIntosh, it has been a real pleasure.
[435:01.22]That's the actor for 47 in the Hitman games.
[435:04.33]We welcome you.
[435:05.19]Well, we're just honored to be here.
[435:07.65]Make your friend behave.
[435:09.41]We got enough trouble from some of the residents.
[435:12.01]Old timers who've gone sadly to seed and lost their dignity.
[435:16.23]How terrible.
[435:17.79]Come along now.
[435:18.53]I will keep this fellow on the straight and narrow.
[435:21.97]Come back and see us sometime soon, excuse me, gentlemen.
[435:25.71]Bo, these better be ugly rooms.
[435:29.05]Is it true you were seen talking to that wretched Penelope Braithwaite?
[435:32.84]I can't thank you enough.
[435:34.12]Where have you been?
[435:35.12]Around.
[435:36.20]And where are you staying?
[435:37.28]I'm renting a caravan on the edge of town behind the church.
[435:41.22]It's horrible, but no one comes looking.
[435:43.67]Guaranteed.
[435:43.99]The whole town is trapped in this interminable feud between the two families.
[435:49.31]His lot, Gray's, and Braithwaite's.
[435:52.37]Interesting.
[435:53.44]All I needed was, what was that, two seconds of one dialogue line?
[435:58.82]Come on.
[436:08.94]There's been a price on my head for 13 years.
[436:11.58]It'll take a month to find us down here.
[436:13.38]Then it seems like we can have a little sport.
[436:16.08]Well, there are good bounties.
[436:17.28]Where you hear this?
[436:18.30]Some fellas I met at a camp near the state line said there was talk of it in bars in the north and west for 500 miles.
[436:27.54]There was talk of super agents or something.
[436:30.92]Super agents.
[436:32.00]It's no shave November.
[436:33.30]Arthur can't shave.
[436:34.80]It's just talk.
[436:35.80]I'm sure it is, but I couldn't not tell you.
[436:38.68]I trust him.
[436:39.14]After a bow like that, I trust him.
[436:50.93]You thought it was a different kind of November?
[436:54.25]Oh, I see what you're saying.
[436:55.47]I mean, I'm doing that.
[436:56.51]It's really not that hard.
[436:57.60]No, not like...
[437:16.07]Don't have to eat any of them.
[437:17.23]No walnuts, no almonds.
[437:18.67]It's only been 30 days.
[437:20.69]It's no big deal, guys.
[437:24.40]You can't... It's not hard.
[437:28.02]Sure, why not?
[437:30.38]Great.
[437:33.11]I mean, some people, yeah, you love cashews, it's hard.
[437:38.58]Oh shit, peanut butter!
[437:41.50]I can't, how many days has it been?
[437:43.90]How many days?
[437:44.76]What happened?
[437:45.76]What day is it?
[437:46.54]November what?
[437:47.40]Fuck, man!
[437:49.16]November 5th?
[437:50.28]I lasted five days, it's fucking so hard!
[437:52.81]Shit.
[438:03.25]Are we gonna go fishing or what?
[438:10.16]What's the matter here?
[438:15.94]Wait, did I just accept to go fishing, didn't I?
[438:24.01]I'm supposed to go after the bear.
[438:26.79]Four hours ago.
[438:30.64]What if I just run into a wall and die?
[438:32.29]No, that's a lot of money.
[438:51.68]Stop fishing with your two dads.
[438:53.61]I will.
[439:11.14]Where is this spot, Hosea?
[439:13.30]Timbuktu?
[439:14.56]Not too much farther.
[439:16.24]Anyway, you two never told me properly about that business with Cornwall in Valentine.
[439:21.46]What happened there?
[439:22.18]Apart from scaring the living daylights out of Mr. Strauss.
[439:26.09]That was about the only upside.
[439:28.57]John and I didn't even have time to get paid for the sheep we rushed.
[439:32.59]It is safe to say Mr. Cornwall isn't a man to let bygones be bygones.
[439:38.95]ambushed us in the saloon.
[439:40.87]He came with a lot of guards and what seemed like just about every lawman in the county.
[439:46.40]We've had closer shaves, but not that many.
[439:49.84]And if Cornwall found us, the Pinkertons couldn't have been far behind.
[439:53.40]If Cornwall found us, the Pinkertons wouldn't be far behind.
[439:56.81]Remember?
[439:57.85]Listen, it was good we moved when we did, but that mess is behind us now.
[440:03.67]Yes.
[440:05.27]Jack told me you were a good teacher when you took him fishing.
[440:09.09]I said he must have you confused with someone else.
[440:11.72]I said he must have you confused with someone else.
[440:16.90]Very funny.
[440:32.58]Very funny.
[440:38.82]Where's the spot?
[440:39.92]Where's the secret fishing spot?
[440:46.37]This is the spot.
[440:47.81]Down to the left there.
[440:48.67]What are you doing?
[440:51.81]He tried to kick him.
[440:56.98]He's just trying to road rash him.
[441:05.00]GTA car dialogue, but roads are longer and vehicles are slower.
[441:08.40]I mean, it's not wrong.
[441:10.70]I saw some boats around last time.
[441:12.08]Be good to get to deeper water.
[441:19.65]Yes, over there on the shore.
[441:21.07]What the hell was that?
[441:23.81]Behind you.
[441:24.83]Okay, go!
[441:31.54]I'm sure nobody would mind if we borrowed one of these.
[441:34.59]What are we doing?
[441:38.79]What are we borrowing?
[441:41.34]Oh, one of the boats.
[441:47.56]Don't tip the boat over here.
[441:55.11]Get ready to row a boat for five minutes.
[441:58.87]Okay.
[442:00.57]Come on, Arthur.
[442:01.47]Let's get her in the water.
[442:02.91]No, no.
[442:04.94]I got a good feeling about fishing here.
[442:06.84]You're supposed to be some incredible sturgeon.
[442:10.69]It's a boat mimic.
[442:14.03]Teeth just come out.
[442:19.30]Let me row.
[442:20.08]You boys are too old for real labor no more.
[442:23.30]You're too dumb for anything else.
[442:26.37]You're still too quick for me, old man.
[442:28.69]I enjoy picking on children.
[442:30.51]Now take us to the deeper water.
[442:33.42]Hey, that's some next-level thinking there.
[442:36.00]I wonder if I can get the horse in the boat.
[442:38.42]What about stupid luck, good fish?
[442:41.15]That'll do, too.
[442:43.45]Keep going.
[443:02.07]Will you stop messing around
[443:33.03]No, you can't.
[443:33.71]I don't think so.
[443:37.49]Oh, what?
[443:37.79]I'm turning around, dude.
[443:43.22]This was an attempt to see if it was possible.
[443:44.84]You know, you probably could set it up, though.
[443:51.66]Eventually, in multiplayer, I'm sure somebody could just sit there and jump off and land on it.
[444:02.54]What about stupid luck and good fish?
[444:05.50]That'll do, too.
[444:07.80]Keep going.
[444:11.89]Oh, he is very good at rowing this boat.
[444:13.85]You know how hard this is to do?
[444:16.19]With that much weight in it.
[444:27.13]I think here's good.
[444:28.77]All right.
[444:29.73]Good luck, gentlemen.
[444:36.39]Where's your rod, Arthur?
[444:38.19]Should really come here at dawn or dusk.
[444:40.69]That's when you catch the best fish.
[444:43.23]We should use a lake lure.
[444:44.50]That'll give us a much better chance of hooking something big like a sturgeon.
[444:48.68]Lake lure.
[444:49.44]Strong as a good old worm.
[444:52.62]Now, worms are good for tiddlers like bluegill and rock bass, but you'd have to be real lucky to catch a sturgeon with one.
[445:01.19]I'm just trying to tangle the lines.
[445:06.15]Keep the lure moving slowly on the water so it looks like a little fish just asking to be eaten.
[445:22.81]I think that's a bite.
[445:24.39]Got him?
[445:26.97]What about me?
[445:27.51]That feels like a bite.
[445:28.61]Where's mine?
[445:28.99]That one.
[445:30.05]Damn it, I lost him.
[445:31.97]Come on, Arthur.
[445:32.95]You can't go back empty-handed.
[445:35.99]Looks like you got a bite, Arthur.
[445:37.59]Now reel him in, Arthur.
[445:51.07]Quickly run.
[445:51.51]That's what I'm doing.
[445:52.15]I was just doing that.
[445:54.05]That's weird.
[446:06.93]How far did I cast this?
[446:08.44]Um, how far away is the line?
[446:36.69]reel it faster.
[446:37.43]I'm going like this.
[446:39.43]I'm spinning it.
[446:44.46]Hey, look at this beauty.
[446:46.02]This thing's huge.
[446:47.36]There you go.
[446:48.44]Well done, Arthur.
[446:50.06]They can grow a lot bigger than that.
[446:51.44]A fella told me he once saw a monster lake sturgeon near the mouth of the river.
[446:55.98]Monster.
[446:56.58]Just southwest of St.
[446:58.06]Denis.
[446:58.46]50-pounder, he wrote.
[446:59.34]Oh, man.
[447:00.08]Don't even tell me.
[447:00.72]I would like to see that.
[447:02.54]There we go.
[447:03.44]Hey, Hosea.
[447:05.82]Remember that time we sent Arthur out fishing?
[447:09.82]He came back with three beautiful bass.
[447:13.39]Not this again.
[447:14.65]I don't think I do.
[447:16.03]Oh yeah, you do.
[447:19.28]He was maybe 20.
[447:23.07]21 walked in all full of himself.
[447:25.87]We had a big feet This was 15 years ago Then the next week Arthur and I are at the market and fishmonger calls out.
[447:29.97]So how did you enjoy those bass?
[447:31.99]Oh
[447:46.02]you can fish or you can go drinking all day rob someone and buy someone's a fighter fish on the line arthur I used to go fishing with this fella back in the day I'm going way faster than he is moving real miserable bastard but he loved to fish we go out all the time but
[448:09.76]One day, we were river fishing when we see a funeral procession going over the bridge and out of the blue, Wesley stands up, takes off his hat, bows his head.
[448:21.02]Then he sits down, picks his rod back up and carries on.
[448:24.64]Doesn't say a word.
[448:26.24]So I'm a little surprised and say, Wesley, that was nice of you.
[448:31.21]He replies, well, felt I had to.
[448:33.89]He lost 100 viewers on this mission.
[448:37.38]Well, I have to do it.
[448:39.36]Oh, dear God.
[448:40.55]I might swim to shore.
[448:43.53]There's nothing on that.
[448:45.51]Can I change direction?
[448:49.35]Remember those big salmon I caught in Montana last year?
[448:52.55]We had a banquet planned that night until Coppa went and scoffed a lot.
[448:56.58]You never had control of that dog.
[448:59.80]Uh, he had some spirit, though.
[449:01.32]Wheeze slams hand on table.
[449:02.58]Never lost the puppy in him.
[449:04.32]Right to the end.
[449:05.54]You know, I remember us saying how Blackwater was the furthest east we'd ever been.
[449:11.17]As a group, I mean.
[449:12.73]Feels like the more we try to head west, the further east we end up.
[449:17.03]We had all those safe spots picked out to lie low in New Austin after the ferry job.
[449:21.81]I liked it there.
[449:23.45]Still open and wild.
[449:24.99]Come here, you little shit.
[449:26.61]Somehow the desert makes you feel closer to the sky.
[449:30.97]No point us trying to get back that way anytime soon.
[449:35.24]Pinkerton's had patrols out all over tall trees and great plains.
[449:39.54]You saw when we went back for Sean.
[449:42.06]Well, look at us now, huh?
[449:44.04]It could be worse.
[449:45.50]Plans change.
[449:47.10]That's just how life goes.
[449:48.10]Yeah, one more fish.
[449:53.39]What is it?
[449:54.05]Did I ever tell you my mother's buried in Blackwater?
[449:58.15]Really?
[449:58.81]She is?
[449:59.56]Apparently so.
[450:01.18]I only found out from an uncle of mine years later.
[450:05.22]Last I knew, she was still outside Philadelphia.
[450:08.96]I left home at 15 and didn't see her again.
[450:11.52]You're getting some interesting facts.
[450:13.41]Ow, my finger.
[450:14.91]See eye to eye.
[450:16.97]Yeah, I did.
[450:48.89]Good job, Arthur.
[450:51.03]Okay.
[450:55.51]Oh, Arthur's pleased with that one.
[451:00.91]Well, guys, this has been fun.
[451:02.76]Hey, I reckon we call it a day, fellas.
[451:06.30]Already?
[451:07.34]You ain't been chasing down outlaws.
[451:12.52]All right.
[451:13.10]I think we got a decent haul here.
[451:15.66]Pearson will be happy.
[451:17.93]Should we head back?
[451:18.67]We could keep the boat not too far back to camp from here.
[451:21.55]Good idea.
[451:22.63]It could be useful.
[451:23.53]What about the horses?
[451:25.35]They'll find their way back.
[451:26.79]Okay, so we've got a big boat.
[451:29.33]That was fun.
[451:31.51]Thank you, boys.
[451:33.47]So are the horses going to be fine?
[451:35.39]How about a song?
[451:36.87]Okay.
[451:39.83]All right, I got one for you.
[451:41.75]I asked that gal to give me something.
[451:48.59]I asked that gal to give me some.
[451:51.14]She says wait until the tater's is done.
[451:56.30]I couldn't wait until the tater's was done.
[452:01.09]I couldn't wait until the tater's was done.
[452:03.37]Threw her on the floor and knocked off some.
[452:06.03]I wish the tater saw me.
[452:12.87]Guys.
[452:13.15]Guys, I think I'm gonna pass out.
[452:15.94]Could somebody else please row?
[452:18.76]What?
[452:30.87]uh... uh...
[452:59.54]We care not for martial men that do our states disdain, but we care for the merchant men that do our states maintain.
[453:10.77]To them we dance this round, round, round.
[453:13.39]To them we dance this round, round, round.
[453:16.12]And he that is a bully boy, come pledge me on this ground, the ground, the ground, the ground, the ground, the ground, the ground.
[453:32.54]Why am I not singing?
[454:05.35]We're here.
[454:07.80]Arthur found a pretty good-sized fish.
[454:10.38]That's for sure.
[454:11.62]All right.
[454:15.30]I think I... I mean, we... are gonna be okay.
[454:24.35]I know.
[454:27.59]I always know.
[454:29.45]Whenever I got you two by my side...
[454:34.83]24 hours free.
[454:36.17]No.
[454:36.41]I'm going to hunt the bear.
[454:42.15]I'm going to go after the bear.
[454:45.52]And then I'm probably going to end it after a successful bear hunt.
[454:53.16]It's a beautiful, beautiful sea.
[455:29.26]I'm gonna change my clothes to cool down.
[456:28.22]Christ.
[457:02.98]You're gonna die!
[457:08.36]I'll kill you, I swear it!
[457:17.16]Not again.
[458:04.43]Thank you.
[458:42.92]Get out of the boat.
[458:43.74]Oh wait the boat is- wait.
[458:45.58]What?
[458:49.36]What the fuck?
[458:54.19]Give me the boat.
[458:54.73]Give me the boat.
[458:55.19]Give me the boat.
[458:56.61]Give me the boat.
[458:57.05]Give me the boat.
[458:57.69]Give me the boat.
[458:58.53]Boat.
[459:00.81]Is it sink?
[459:01.45]It sunk.
[459:16.76]Oh my god, I'm gonna drown.
[459:24.12]Drink something!
[459:25.39]Oh, fuck!
[459:33.55]Get out there, come on!
[459:36.48]Come on, come on!

[459:42.02]Come on!
[459:44.16]Get me out there!
[459:47.26]Remedy!
[459:48.26]Remedy!
[459:48.76]I have no idea why that guy got up.
[460:20.72]I just knocked him out.
[460:21.68]I was like, didn't I step on his head like twice?
[460:28.08]I got taken out.
[460:38.99]I fell down in the boat.
[460:40.39]The boat sank.
[460:41.13]And that guy had more, I had not as much stamina as that guy.
[460:49.55]Oh well.
[460:55.33]He was too strong and cool.
[460:56.97]What are you calling my name?
[461:08.79]At least the clothes are clean, that's right.
[461:10.25]Alright, here we go.

[461:12.21]Uh, I want... Let's see, we got high velocity...

[461:31.75]Pig.
[461:37.96]Where's the bear?
[461:42.74]Isn't the bear up here?
[461:57.40]He's like up in the snow.
[461:58.62]Where the hell is he?
[462:22.65]There's like a deer.
[462:31.38]Is something wrong with my brain?

[464:00.93]I need to take a stagecoach to Emerald Ranch.
[464:06.77]And then go up from Emerald Ranch.
[464:12.46]Is there a stagecoach right here?
[464:13.86]Is there a stagecoach over here?
[464:19.12]No.
[464:21.26]There's not.
[464:22.25]Because that's our camp.
[464:29.09]Let's go.
[464:29.47]Let me eat.
[464:45.44]I wanna constantly be snacking.
[464:52.89]I bought a fast travel map?
[464:54.17]Yeah, but I don't wanna use it yet.
[464:59.52]I'd rather, um, not do fast travel yet.
[465:04.24]At least not from the mat.
[465:05.92]I mean, technically I'm about to do fast travel with the stagecoach, but it's a little different.
[465:17.39]There is a random encounter over here.
[465:20.17]Not more than 10 seconds.
[465:26.13]What's up?
[465:26.89]What's happening?
[465:28.19]Oh, there's more than one.

[467:46.75]How did I do this to myself?
[467:55.11]Where's my horse?
[467:56.19]Let's get.
[467:56.69]Is the horse on top of the train?
[468:08.90]Here.

[470:22.92]Well, um, I have to reload the save.
[470:25.86]But where is the save?
[470:26.72]That's why I'd rather die.
[470:27.56]You know what I'm saying?
[470:30.80]I'd rather die.
[470:33.36]I have to, like, antagonize somebody.
[470:46.97]I can't make a campfire either.
[470:48.17]I have to piss somebody off.
[471:05.49]Oh.
[471:06.91]No, no, no.
[471:07.73]Horses.

[472:06.91]Somebody help us!
[472:07.69]No.
[472:17.02]I didn't want to do that.
[472:41.36]Okay, so this is 2332, 2348.
[472:42.30]Wait, what?
[472:42.58]So now I'm going to reload.
[472:43.60]Load game.
[472:43.94]So this auto-saved.
[472:44.74]This is 12 minutes ago, so I need to do this one.
[473:13.01]Wait, no?
[473:13.35]What do you mean no?
[473:15.29]No, no, no.
[473:15.79]What do you mean?
[473:16.25]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[473:23.64]Wrong day?
[473:25.02]What do you mean wrong day?
[473:27.92]Yeah, that's the most recent one.
[473:29.46]Because this is 2320, 2332.
[473:29.96]11-5.
[473:30.00]This is like yesterday.
[473:30.52]Yeah, what are you guys talking about?
[473:47.42]I thought it was just showing me the horses burning.
[473:59.62]I better not be in there.
[474:10.00]And we're good.
[474:11.13]That was weird.
[474:13.35]I made it out of the box.
[474:18.22]Cheated himself out of the box.
[474:19.32]Well, what else was I supposed to do?
[474:20.38]I tried to shoot.
[474:21.32]I tried to get attention.
[474:22.08]Well, there's nothing else I could do there.
[474:28.37]Yep, yep.
[474:33.21]Way to go.
[474:34.46]This way.
[474:35.56]Come on.
[474:37.18]Stay.
[474:45.57]go back in the box I don't think so where's the bear what was I doing the bear oh the stagecoach to emerald ranch right no distraction distraction go
[475:24.20]It's getting late, isn't it?
[475:27.74]It's 1230 Eastern.
[475:29.90]Yeah, this has got to be the final thing.
[475:34.77]This is going to be an 8-9 hour stream here.
[475:44.03]Alright.
[475:45.77]Stagecoach is not open yet.
[475:48.85]So I need to wait.
[475:52.56]No, I don't.
[475:55.49]Emerald Ranch.
[475:57.01]Let's go.
[476:09.80]Yeah, not only has it been eight hours of no internet drops, this has been eight hours of not even one frame dropping.
[476:17.12]Not even one.
[476:19.31]With a 6000k up, six megabits up, one megabits per second.
[476:27.14]That's pretty solid, man.
[476:41.98]Red Cox Redemption.
[476:46.08]Pretty much.
[476:46.92]Well, don't say that yet.
[476:47.86]We could just be in the middle of a very, very large fluke.
[476:52.08]Okay, bear time.
[476:56.56]up here there you are let's go find you internet wise like the actual speed wise the speeds should they're very high speeds it's not a question of speed it's not like oh we can only get 10 up here we've had a thousand down nearly 40 up before so nothing to do with speed there girl
[477:36.46]But if I do want to stream tomorrow, I definitely need to call it soon.
[477:42.37]And we'll see.
[477:49.97]I'm hoping to do it again tomorrow.
[478:09.07]What's the actual stream schedule?
[478:10.21]I don't have one yet.
[478:11.77]Not yet.
[478:15.80]Once it gets further out there and there's more... After a week, I think, of solid connection is when I'm going to start a new schedule.
[478:25.82]Have they resolved the issue or is it just behaving?
[478:30.25]Actually, I really don't know.
[478:33.26]I was told that the people in maintenance know what the problem is, and they see it, and they were gonna fix it.
[478:39.65]I was told that this morning.
[478:43.75]This is after about three days of having a perfect connection.
[478:48.47]So it's very possible that they found it, and a day or two ago they may have just resolved it completely.
[478:55.29]I don't know, it could just be... this could be just a very large, long fluke, but I don't know about that anymore.
[479:03.63]This has been too stable.
[479:14.68]You alright?
[479:17.50]Is the horse okay?
[479:19.40]Here, just have some food.
[479:24.27]How does it keep happening?
[479:26.83]Because it's actually fairly difficult to not run into a tree.
[479:31.57]Alright, let's find this bear.
[479:33.33]What do you say?
[479:33.83]Wait, do I have my rifle?
[479:36.01]I do not.
[479:39.62]Super damage, long scope.
[479:41.60]And I want the shotgun, too.
[479:46.90]So I want the... Oops.
[479:52.42]With express bullets...
[479:59.00]I also want a double-barreled shotgun.
[480:01.50]Oh, the pump action.
[480:02.42]Oh, no, actually, double-barreled shotgun as well.
[480:09.81]How is this?
[480:11.99]What condition is this in?
[480:15.81]Clean it up for the encounter, just in case.
[480:17.69]You know, you need that extra 0.2% of damage.
[480:22.99]Just wrestle the bear with a knife.
[480:25.27]It's probably not going to happen.
[480:29.84]How's this one?
[480:32.36]Get him perfect.
[480:44.65]So that's on express.
[480:46.85]I got it equipped.
[480:48.80]Let's go.
[480:52.80]Looking for the first clue.
[481:05.64]Nothing so far.
[481:07.90]This is the area, though.
[481:10.78]How are my cores doing?
[481:21.04]What?
[481:23.70]What's happening?
[481:25.02]Do I want... Do you want to overwrite the data?
[481:29.80]Yeah, what?
[481:35.52]I picked up a flower and it wants to save the game in a different s- oh.
[481:40.08]I see.
[481:41.64]Do you own this game?
[481:43.63]Are you sure you own this game?
[481:44.91]Alright, that's enough flowers.
[481:50.55]I'll do- I want my Deadeye to be refilled here.
[482:02.05]How many of these do I have?
[482:03.05]Six of eight.
[482:04.27]Yeah, I just... I don't want him to fall, do I?
[482:08.17]Okay, here we go.
[482:10.65]This time, I'm gonna get him in one shot.
[482:12.05]There's another clue up here.
[482:34.38]Some bear shit.
[482:41.51]Alright, shit means close.
[482:48.45]Is that a bear?
[482:49.87]That's a bear up there, guys.
[482:53.22]There he is.
[483:04.05]Study it first.
[483:04.69]Okay.
[483:32.94]I'm like the kid in the Hunter movie.
[483:35.06]When he can't pull the trigger, he just can't do it.
[483:37.56]I need like the perfect shot.
[483:42.84]Oh, he's running over here.
[483:44.44]He's running over here.
[483:45.32]How do I get up?
[483:52.04]How do I get up?
[484:06.53]I got him!
[484:18.18]Ugh.
[484:20.64]Ugh.
[484:27.78]Okay.
[484:33.25]Ugh.
[484:43.82]And the Oscar goes to... What, Levi?
[484:47.68]God.
[484:56.77]Legendary bear pelt.
[484:58.53]Big game meat.
[484:59.13]Legendary bear claw.
[485:00.21]Animal fat.
[485:00.73]You cannot harvest all this animal's parts as you have no space to stow them.
[485:16.45]What useless shit do I have on my body here?
[485:20.00]Coffee?
[485:26.38]This is just shitty meat.
[485:30.92]Springy meat.
[485:34.47]Get rid of it.
[485:38.59]Discard them all.
[485:42.65]Um... Fucking carrots?
[485:51.32]I ate the chocolate bar.
[486:19.80]So how do I take the rest of the stuff?
[486:25.34]You know what I mean?
[486:34.91]Do I have it all now?
[486:49.89]Well, now I can get the bear stuff.
[486:53.27]Nothing else I can do with this?
[487:08.50]No, they can't do anything else.
[487:18.17]So I must have gotten everything I could.
[487:24.11]It's too big.
[487:24.97]Oh, well.
[487:25.91]Well, I have it.
[487:32.80]Can't carry it, so I can't do anything about it.
[487:36.20]Shit, I, like, wish I could pick that up or something.
[487:43.04]Oh, well.
[487:47.40]Well, I got him.
[487:49.04]That was fucking crazy.
[487:50.21]Alright, now to the trapper.
[487:54.19]Oy.
[487:59.53]My lord, that's far away.
[488:01.32]There's not another trapper anywhere?
[488:20.40]No, like... Who's singing?
[488:34.66]There's one to the east.
[488:40.45]A closer one.
[488:43.51]Like, over here.
[488:44.15]I just haven't seen it yet.
[488:46.25]Like, should I just go this way?
[488:49.93]Go to kind of uncharted territory here and just go over here.
[489:00.64]Near the V. It's like down here.
[489:05.61]We'll go down here.
[489:31.94]Take a stage, coach?
[489:33.68]That's where it is.
[489:35.82]I think it's down there.
[489:37.04]Well, thanks for staying up late, everybody.
[489:56.08]I'm currently very addicted to this game.
[489:59.59]This might, uh, top... This might top House Flipper for Game of the Year.
[490:06.49]It's gonna be tough.
[490:21.13]Yeah, once I turn this in, it's gonna be done.
[490:24.05]So we've gone for a long time, eight hours here.
[490:26.53]Probably about nine hours total with the bits and subs and everything.
[490:30.63]So, time to close it out.
[490:32.45]So what do you think?
[490:35.05]I'm uh, I was gonna just do it tomorrow too.
[490:38.21]I was gonna just turn it on and just keep going.
[490:40.83]More Red Dead, just... You guys want, you good with that?
[490:43.99]You guys... Just do it, do this, do the same thing tomorrow?
[490:49.42]I'm loving it, I'm having a lot of fun.
[490:56.17]Game is 60 hours long?
[490:57.30]Well, we're already about 20-something through.
[491:01.26]When's a multiplayer available?
[491:09.85]And while I can't promise to complete this entire game on stream, while I'm still into it and while I still think it's a lot of fun, I would rather be able to just have fun with all of you.
[491:21.90]You know what I mean?
[491:24.56]And I'm getting distracted again, but, I mean, like, look at this.
[491:48.56]Can't take any more.
[491:56.09]Might as well peek in and see what's up here.
[492:03.29]Now I know that there is some potential for jump on the horse from up here.
[492:09.89]I agree.
[492:11.25]I think I could do it.
[492:12.17]I'm pretty sure I can make it.
[492:14.45]But that's a bad idea.
[492:21.21]I ain't losing that legendary pelt.
[492:23.35]So, that's just not going to happen.
[492:44.86]Here.
[492:48.72]Well, he's smashing into a bunch of- nevermind, he's not gonna be able to do it.
[493:05.24]Jeremy dot dot dot dot.
[493:07.53]Okay, there's nothing here.
[493:08.55]Alright, so what- where's this trapper?
[493:12.79]I'm at the V. I'm at the V!
[493:19.17]Right here?
[493:22.90]Maybe that's where it just was.
[493:26.72]Above the V.
[493:54.21]It's on your map a bit, but it's north, but it's locked?
[493:57.87]Is it really?
[494:07.90]Oh, shit.
[494:08.60]There he is.
[494:10.06]Thank you!
[494:10.88]Thank you for- Thank you!
[494:32.39]And here he is.
[494:34.01]I got something for you, dude.
[494:35.89]And then what can we make with the bear?
[494:44.66]I got something for you.
[494:46.96]What?
[494:47.42]What are you talking about?
[494:48.94]What did I do?
[494:49.28]What did I do wrong?
[495:05.86]Alright, legendary is 60 bucks.
[495:07.14]That's pretty great.
[495:09.12]So, sell this.
[495:10.12]Do I have anything else?
[495:10.86]Should I sell him all the other stuff?
[495:12.14]Like the bear claw, the legendary claw?
[495:14.84]Should I just give this dude literally everything?
[495:21.82]Oh, I'd know those scars anywhere.
[495:24.32]Looks like Barati met his match at last, huh?
[495:27.40]My congratulations.
[495:28.68]So let's see.
[495:29.20]The bear hunter, I'm assuming, is what I get here.
[495:31.56]Legendary bear head.
[495:32.50]Oh, man.
[495:38.23]So I can make the dumb hat now?
[495:45.37]Hey, Otto.
[495:48.63]Hold on.
[495:50.78]Hold on a second.
[495:51.39]I got to let Otto outside.
[495:52.33]Give me one sec.
[495:53.62]I know you want to...
[497:11.08]Okay, I got all kinds of shit in this room now I gotta get like peanut butter jars coffee cups All right, I gotta clean this place up a little Show auto I just put up downstairs.
[497:31.37]All right, so sell the bear pelt, right?
[497:34.38]Oh, I know those scars anywhere.
[497:37.02]Looks like Barati met his match at last, huh?
[497:40.13]My congratulations.
[497:44.95]No auto.
[497:53.47]60 bucks.
[497:55.79]And what else can I give him?
[497:58.58]Here, I'll give you like a couple of turkey feathers.
[498:03.36]What else we got here?
[498:04.84]Bear claw.
[498:07.99]Shitty snake skin.
[498:09.01]Who cares?
[498:11.19]Animal fat.
[498:12.91]How about some fish?
[498:16.19]Get rid of that, too.
[498:21.28]Okay.
[498:23.60]So let's make the bear house.
[498:26.48]Don't put the gun away.
[498:31.48]The gun away?
[498:38.06]All I can make is the bear hat with this.
[498:43.67]Or is there other clothing?
[498:44.87]The trophy buck?
[498:46.47]No.
[498:49.53]I can't make anything else?
[498:57.35]Well, there it is.
[498:59.09]One perfect snakeskin, one perfect sheep hide, so I've already given it to him.
[499:02.49]A lot of hats.
[499:07.94]Well, I have it.
[499:22.70]So what's the other legendary bear?
[499:24.92]Legendary bear coat.
[499:25.96]I need a perfect bison pelt.
[499:29.78]Perfect bull hide.
[499:33.32]This doesn't even have anything with a bear.
[499:36.78]Oh, I got a cool hat.
[499:40.48]Reinforced equipment.
[499:41.38]Horseman.
[499:43.32]Horseman gun belt.
[499:46.27]Why did I just get this?
[499:47.33]Like... This is better.
[499:47.99]Sharpshooter.
[499:48.87]Sharpshooter.
[499:49.35]Complete... I gotta complete challenges for these.
[499:50.77]Gambler holster.
[499:51.36]Oh, this is a bunch of shit now, isn't it?
[500:11.99]Explore, Horseman, Weapons Expert, Bandit.
[500:15.43]Oh man, there's so much to do here.
[500:18.72]Explore.
[500:20.82]Increase ammo capacity for repeaters, rifles, and shotguns.
[500:28.44]Maintenance.
[500:29.20]I could get this.
[500:29.80]Increase ammo capacity for rifles and repeaters and shotguns.
[500:36.65]That's pretty good.
[500:39.03]I'll take it.
[500:41.95]Yeah, the treasure hunting.
[500:47.74]Okay, cool.
[500:50.62]What about saddles?
[500:51.78]No.
[500:52.94]Perfect boar, perfect... Ten perfect snakeskin!
[500:59.46]Gun oil, scent... Ooh!
[501:02.56]Never used one myself.
[501:04.14]Boy, do they make a mess.
[501:13.51]Well, here's the one good thing.
[501:14.53]This is going to be in every cutscene now, so.
[501:19.82]Okay, so that is where I'm going to call it tonight.
[501:24.90]We are going to pick up pretty much exactly where we left off right here.
[501:29.87]Save the game right now.
[501:35.67]And I will see you guys tomorrow.
[501:48.47]Because it is very late.
[501:51.06]It is 1 a.m.
[501:51.82]Eastern.
[501:52.80]I don't typically go for this long into the night like this, I know.
[501:57.82]For Europeans and for... And Americans.
[502:02.38]And anybody else, really.
[502:03.26]This is probably the worst time to be live, right?
[502:07.85]Because it's just so late for everybody.
[502:12.27]I'm going to start probably around the same time.
[502:13.85]Hopefully.
[502:15.33]I would assume around 1 or 2 p.m.
[502:16.87]Pacific.
[502:17.93]Pacific?
[502:21.63]And that's going to be it.
[502:23.33]So let me get to the bits.
[502:25.55]If you're taking off, have a great rest of your night.
[502:27.14]Don't blame me for leaving right now.
[502:28.52]It is probably very late for you.
[502:32.18]Thanks for coming by.
[502:33.88]See you tomorrow.
[502:36.22]Those of you else that are here, let's go down here a long time ago.
[502:42.57]This is eight hours ago now.
[502:47.73]This is from Sly161 for $1.
[502:51.43]Thank you.
[502:52.53]Hope you're enjoying Vegas.
[502:58.11]I am, Sly.
[503:00.51]And... Night classes?
[503:04.87]I used to do a lot of night classes.
[503:06.07]I loved night classes.
[503:08.81]Just because you didn't have to wake up.
[503:11.42]You can sleep as long as you wanted.
[503:13.14]You don't have to get up to... People used to do, I remember people said, oh yeah, I do 7, 8 a.m.
[503:17.26]classes.
[503:18.56]It's like, man, I would rather just be able to sleep till like 11.
[503:23.65]But, best of luck to you.
[503:27.23]I'm enjoying Vegas a lot.
[503:29.81]Looks like the wheels are starting to turn, so it should be great.
[503:32.75]I mean, you have to wake up at some point, yeah.
[503:39.02]Sparky, thank you Sparky for the $1.
[503:40.86]Derma, did you know that Executive Assault 2 is out on Steam?
[503:45.88]I did.
[503:46.26]I did.
[503:48.26]But isn't it a completely different game?
[503:52.52]It's not like two random dudes running around with pistols getting into robots, right?
[503:57.63]Isn't it like an actual space combat sim?
[504:00.67]Or am I completely wrong?
[504:06.43]I thought it was like a totally different game.
[504:09.47]I could be 100% incorrect.
[504:14.70]Take care.
[504:15.04]That was your first stream for you.
[504:17.06]Well, thanks for coming out, Gaz.
[504:18.92]Hope you had fun.
[504:22.46]Hope you had a good time.
[504:26.19]Timmy gave the $50 earlier.
[504:28.67]Scripps gave the $50 earlier.
[504:30.25]Thank you, both of you.
[504:32.51]Very much so.
[504:34.77]Sparky gave $5.
[504:35.49]Germa, are you going to play Executive Assault 2 as another one?
[504:40.59]Thanks for the $5, Sparky.
[504:41.87]And I'll have to take another look at it.
[504:44.21]Apparently, people want me to play it.
[504:48.38]Maybe.
[504:48.82]We'll see.
[504:50.32]Flubbagut, thanks for the $1, Flubbagut.
[504:52.68]Flubbagut, you can't begin to imagine how grateful I am that you are back.
[504:57.74]You can't imagine how happy I am to be back.
[505:01.46]I was so antsy for a while here.
[505:04.20]It got bad.
[505:05.44]It really did.
[505:07.00]Especially this last week straight.
[505:10.04]Because I was able to stream randomly at random times.
[505:12.61]It's just going live, not going live.
[505:15.59]I would stream for 40 minutes, stream for 10 minutes.
[505:20.37]I wanted to be back like the 12th or 13th of October.
[505:27.48]I wanted to land that balloon much faster than I did.
[505:30.84]I'll just put it that way.
[505:35.12]But thank you, Floppigut.
[505:36.48]Good to be back.
[505:38.18]DubskyDude, thanks for the $1, Dubsky.
[505:39.84]I was the one that snuck in the compact part in the Wikipedia page in an effort to make it passable so that non-German normies wouldn't suspect our covert memeing.
[505:50.13]Now chat's gonna mess it all up.
[505:55.13]Oh.
[505:55.25]I don't even want to know what that fucking Wikipedia page looks like right now.
[506:05.02]But thank you, DubskyDude.
[506:09.28]Thank you.
[506:11.06]Adaris, thanks for the $5.05.
[506:12.66]No message, but thank you so much for the five spot here.
[506:16.86]Thanks a lot, man.
[506:18.38]Sparky again gave $5.00.
[506:19.88]Thank you, Sparky.
[506:21.60]Jeremy, you're going to play Executive Assault 2 after Red Dead.
[506:28.00]Maybe.
[506:31.92]Thank you, Sparky.
[506:32.60]Yeah.
[506:34.93]Maybe I'll hit up Mr. Stir.
[506:38.85]We'll take a look at it and see if it's worth playing.
[506:42.85]Puppet Russ, thanks for the $1.
[506:43.81]No message.
[506:44.81]Just $1.
[506:45.79]Thank you.
[506:47.47]Bet3, thanks for the $10.
[506:49.38]Bet3.
[506:49.90]$10.
[506:51.14]Thank you for showing auto and thank you for being a kind and funny guy.
[506:56.80]Much love to you.
[506:57.42]Jeremiah Hart.
[506:58.24]Thank you.
[507:00.48]Thank you so much for the $10.
[507:01.28]I really appreciate it.
[507:03.98]And yeah, of course I'm showing off.
[507:07.30]Otto just, Otto's like kind of, he doesn't, he's all over the place, right?
[507:10.54]Otto doesn't like to stay in the same place for very long.
[507:14.18]He'll sleep.
[507:15.96]And he'll like to be downstairs.
[507:17.08]He likes to be around Kim.
[507:19.14]So anytime Kim's around, he's just like, where's Kim?
[507:22.96]Where's Kim?
[507:23.28]Is Kim around?
[507:24.46]So he always kind of wants to be open and not like closed in a room.
[507:27.88]So that's why I don't really have him here.
[507:31.93]So he likes to kind of go where he wants to go.
[507:34.97]Let's put it that way.
[507:36.59]As you just saw, he was like, let me out of the room, please.
[507:40.89]But yeah, thank you for the $10.
[507:42.19]Really appreciate it.
[507:43.77]Lazy Luke, thanks for the $1.
[507:45.41]They say hi.
[507:46.10]Hi.
[507:46.86]And by the way, these are all like seven hours ago.
[507:48.94]So if you're still here, then hello.
[507:51.82]If not, then thank you anyways.
[507:56.36]Div USP, thanks for the $3.
[507:58.02]No message.
[507:58.48]Thanks for $3, dude.
[508:00.90]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the $1.
[508:04.00]This is an ode to Odie.
[508:05.38]Please sing it.
[508:08.38]I would.
[508:08.72]I don't think I have the energy to sing at the moment.
[508:12.49]I will read it in one breath as fast as I can.
[508:16.17]Odie's a doggie, a sweet doggie, standing next to John John.
[508:18.07]Lasagna grows in the soil.
[508:18.97]There's still hope for Garfield to exist, to survive, to thrive in the way that he lives.
[508:22.67]With little food and comics and know-how and love, we will survive.
[508:25.49]And our doggie, our trusty doggie, one day Odie will find a way.
[508:32.93]What?
[508:33.93]Did you just, is this like an Odie doesn't, what?
[508:40.40]Is Odie still fine?
[508:44.46]The Garfield prayer.
[508:46.96]That was like at church.
[508:48.80]Sitting there at church with your head down like, I think I remember the words.
[508:57.83]Thank you, though, Garfield.
[508:58.59]I don't think too confusing.
[509:00.40]I mean, the word Sonic existed back then.
[509:02.10]It just meant really fast and, like, lightning and speed and Sonic.
[509:04.76]That was a word, right?
[509:05.70]Maybe it wasn't.
[509:06.08]Who made up the word Sonic?
[509:28.31]They would just lock you up.
[509:31.13]Hey, System Lord, thank you for the $10, System Lord.
[509:36.19]I just broke up with my girlfriend in three years.
[509:38.93]Just wanted to let you know that you're the funniest and realest entertainer I've seen and how much joy your videos have brought me over the years.
[509:44.43]Please keep doing what you do best.
[509:47.79]Really sorry to hear that, System Lord.
[509:49.93]Hopefully you're doing alright.
[509:52.15]That's tough.
[509:53.61]That's a long time.
[509:57.52]Three years is... That's a very long relationship, so... Hope you're doing alright.
[510:04.25]And thank you for your incredibly nice comment here.
[510:06.73]And the $10, so... Thank you.
[510:13.65]It's never easy.
[510:16.66]And a funny story for you here.
[510:18.78]Not really a funny story, but... I've never been in a relationship that's been longer than two years.
[510:25.76]And even that, like, that's a long time to me.
[510:29.18]So, I can't imagine, like, another year on top of that, too.
[510:31.94]So, good luck to you, man.
[510:37.15]Take care of yourself.
[510:40.13]Wait, what?
[510:40.51]Yeah, no, that's true.
[510:44.99]That is 100% true.
[510:52.34]How are you going to tell that to Kim?
[510:57.34]like a finite amount of time it just happened to be how long they've been it's not like I have a clock on my wrist like there it is the girlfriend meter it's getting to be that time oh I gotta renew the contract no everything's just fine everything is just is gravy don't worry
[511:29.33]But thank you, System Lord.
[511:30.31]Thank you, free iPod for the $1.
[511:31.99]Thank you for being the best streamer.
[511:33.13]Did they have iPods in the 1200s when this game took place?
[511:36.36]Well, they had watches, right?
[511:39.12]Then somebody's gold pocket watch was essentially as coveted as an iPhone.
[511:43.74]So, I mean, sort of.
[511:45.56]They could only do one thing, though.
[511:48.96]WildFox1, thank you for the $10, WildFox1.
[511:54.26]Thank you for being such an amazing personality and helping me through some seriously hard times with depression this year.
[511:59.15]I've watched every stream since you started.
[512:02.21]At least in VOD form since I never get to catch you live.
[512:05.23]You've quickly risen to being my favorite content creator, period.
[512:08.89]Here's to another few years.
[512:12.97]Thank you, Wildfox.
[512:16.51]I'm sorry that you're dealing with that.
[512:22.92]Hopefully, you know, you take each day.
[512:28.74]Anytime somebody tells me that they're suffering from like depression or anxiety or something fucked up, you know what I mean?
[512:34.70]It's always, I always just wish you the best.
[512:36.51]Yeah, keep your head up.
[512:50.07]Keep your head up.
[512:52.33]And thank you so much for the $10 and the support and sticking around.
[512:58.03]I'll be here for as long as I can, right?
[513:03.58]Thanks, dude.
[513:05.84]Man, boy, thank you for the $1.
[513:07.16]The stream is a bit quiet.
[513:10.12]Yeah, I gotta mess with some more microphone settings.
[513:12.15]I feel like... I feel like I'm peaking.
[513:15.85]But when I get loud, I peak.
[513:18.47]But when I'm not, the microphone is not picking up that well.
[513:22.73]I don't know.
[513:22.99]I got to figure that out.
[513:26.13]I mean, I have a compressor right now.
[513:27.61]I don't have a hardware compressor.
[513:28.91]I have a software compressor.
[513:31.01]But I probably have to change it a little bit.
[513:34.20]Because it is a little screwed up, I think.
[513:40.74]I will fix that.
[513:43.76]But thank you.
[513:46.80]Thank you also, Kaltari.
[513:49.00]Kaltari with the $55.
[513:52.83]Huge money from a few people here tonight.
[513:54.37]Thank you guys so much.
[513:57.07]Bombun, thanks for the $1.
[513:58.41]Loving the Red Dead streams.
[513:59.35]Looking forward to more in the future.
[514:01.16]I love the game.
[514:04.06]So, I'm glad you're enjoying it.
[514:06.86]I'm having a lot of fun.
[514:09.53]Thank you, Mad.
[514:10.12]47 for the $1.
[514:11.18]Thanks for being a good influence in my life, man.
[514:12.74]It's really needed.
[514:13.66]Love ya.
[514:14.26]Hope everything with Cox gets worked out.
[514:16.70]Thank you, Mad.
[514:19.31]I would say at this point, it looks like it is probably resolved.
[514:27.78]We had about... We're talking two and a half weeks straight of... I mean, it's not like, oh, the internet kind of sucked a little bit.
[514:38.60]No, our internet would turn off.
[514:41.38]Actually, like, not be usable.
[514:42.74]We would get the little symbol.
[514:45.24]You know the caution cone on your internet?
[514:49.10]You know the little internet TV?
[514:50.46]Sometimes the caution cone comes up on the bottom right of your taskbar.
[514:54.79]The caution symbol was just up and our modem was off.
[514:57.26]And it would be off for like seven to eight hours straight.
[515:04.38]So it wasn't just a question of, oh, the internet sucks a little bit.
[515:07.68]Well, I'm dropping some frames.
[515:10.21]It would just turn the fuck off.
[515:12.77]It'd be off 50% of the whole day randomly.
[515:15.77]So it was impossible to stream.
[515:19.67]But, uh, with enough technicians and enough people that were higher up, I guess, that could figure it out, there was an infrastructural issue that they, uh, it looks like at this point, resolved.
[515:32.74]Because we would never, this is a million years, over the last two weeks, besides these last few days, have more than six to seven straight hours of, like, green light.
[515:42.67]So, I don't want to speak so soon, but I really feel like it's probably over.
[515:48.62]Watch it tomorrow, it turns out.
[515:50.62]It could happen, but we've been told that they know what the issue is.
[515:53.66]So, it's just up to them now.
[515:56.96]Thank you, though, Matt.
[515:58.56]Thank you, Diplos.
[515:59.50]Diplos.
[516:01.81]I was going to call you Dip.
[516:04.93]Thank you, Dip, for the $1.
[516:06.51]I can help you buy food if you need it.
[516:12.95]Thanks, man.
[516:15.54]Well, the $1 that you just gave here, that would contribute to food.
[516:20.61]So, thank you.
[516:22.63]Doubled11, thank you, Doubled11, for the $1.
[516:24.41]Hey, German, what's the biggest spider you've ever seen?
[516:27.69]When I lived in Vermont for, like, I don't know, a couple of years, the biggest spider I've ever seen was in my apartment up there.
[516:42.14]It was a scenario where my girlfriend at the time, we were sitting on my bed, and she looked on the wall, we were just sitting there, just talking and hanging out, and she just did this horrified face pointing, and I was facing her, so I didn't, I wasn't facing the wall she was looking at, and she literally pointed at the wall and went, and I turned, and this thing, it's the biggest spider I've ever seen.
[517:08.93]Which one of these, which year was this in your two-year relationship?
[517:14.73]And this place was tiny too, this was like a little shoebox.
[517:18.59]I shared it with somebody else.
[517:20.77]This had to have, this probably was like a 400 square foot apartment.
[517:25.24]And I shared it.
[517:29.80]So this spider was probably taking up about like 4% of the total real estate of the whole property.
[517:41.29]It was very small.
[517:42.67]I didn't live there for very long, but... 400 square foot spider.
[517:50.81]No, but it was... And I didn't... I just didn't know what to do.
[517:52.61]Because it was one... It was big enough where I didn't want to kill it.
[517:55.67]Because... Killing a spider like that... It just... You're gonna cause a huge problem.
[518:04.40]You'd think the thing would have exploded.
[518:10.58]But yeah.
[518:14.34]It wasn't a very long time being there, though.
[518:17.54]Basically, I lived in a spider.
[518:22.22]But, yeah.
[518:23.50]That's the biggest one.
[518:25.48]It was pretty wild.
[518:28.74]We ended up leaving and going to her house.
[518:34.26]And I think she actually said, I'm not going back to where you live again.
[518:37.87]And I was like, oh, that's fine.
[518:40.03]And she was like, you know, I'm looking at my watch right now, and it's two years are up.
[518:44.35]She's like, I think it's time.
[518:45.13]And I was like, no, wait, but is it the spider?
[518:50.37]No.
[518:52.41]But anyways, thanks a lot, man.
[518:54.54]Thank you to Feitoru for the three bucks.
[518:56.82]So while you were heading west, I had a dream that instead of Vegas, you were moving into my place.
[519:02.06]I discovered this by opening the door to you and Italics, who spontaneously showed up and started filling my house with all kinds of bullshit.
[519:09.80]Meanwhile, Otto was running around like crazy with Kim in pursuit trying to stop him.
[519:14.16]The last thing I remember was attempting to go to sleep, but you were streaming in my bedroom and started yelling at me because I was on cam while getting into bed.
[519:20.68]That would be wild.
[519:29.58]Oh, my God.
[519:32.70]Thank you, Feitoru, for your three bucks.
[519:36.35]And that's a pretty good...
[519:38.77]That's, like, that would be funny, though.
[519:40.95]Not, like, if that actually happened to somebody, but... Imagine streaming in the same room that somebody's trying to go to sleep in, and they're, like, behind you.
[519:48.68]Like, you can't... You're gonna be mad at the person for going to bed.
[519:56.50]When I lived in, um... When I lived in Tennessee, I actually shared a place with a roommate.
[520:04.15]And, uh... This is before my broadcasting career, but I used to stream some... I used to stream on, um...
[520:10.29]on live, uh, LiveLand, which is a different, uh, streaming platform back in, like, 1996.
[520:18.29]And he was trying to get into bed one night, and that, like, same kind of scenario played out.
[520:23.77]And he, like, looked at me, and I was like, what the, what's, what's Ryan?
[520:25.91]During one of my, one of my broadcasts, and he was like, what the fuck, dude?
[520:29.33]And I'm like, what's, what's the matter?
[520:30.15]Because I'm looking, I'm looking at him.
[520:31.59]Remember, because my, I was turned away from my computer.
[520:34.32]He's like, dude, what the?
[520:36.12]I'm like, what?
[520:36.52]And I turned around, a huge fucking spider.
[520:38.24]Probably the biggest spider I've ever seen.
[520:41.56]At least, like, twice as big as the other one that I just talked about, so... And then, like, we went to his house.
[520:48.24]Because, I mean, that was at my house, so... But yeah, that's probably the biggest spider I've ever seen.
[521:02.08]Thank you to...
[521:04.16]A toaster in the tub.
[521:06.48]No, that's... Oh, boy.
[521:14.59]Thank you.
[521:15.03]Thank you.
[521:23.53]Jesus Christ.
[521:38.33]Uh, thank you Reaper500 for the $1.
[521:40.28]Hey Jerma, there's a glitch in the game where you can get 30 gold bars.
[521:46.54]Just search unlimited money glitch on YouTube.
[521:48.66]You can go crazy with money.
[521:49.88]I don't want to do that.
[521:51.02]That's essentially cheat codes.
[521:58.25]I'm not going to put cheat codes in yet.
[521:59.73]Not until I beat the game.
[522:01.79]I don't want to do any money glitches.
[522:04.69]We're doing it legit.
[522:08.99]But I kind of want to look that up.
[522:10.87]No, actually, maybe I don't, because I don't know where it is in the story.
[522:13.05]Yeah, I'll do that probably at the end of the game.
[522:17.08]But thank you, though, man.
[522:18.90]Hey, Kvas, thank you, Kvas, Blackthrone, for the $1.
[522:22.40]If this is how you ride horses, I can't imagine you driving a car.
[522:24.90]I actually have a perfect record driving a car.
[522:28.22]I would drive everywhere.
[522:30.58]Back when I was in Massachusetts, me and Kim would go everywhere.
[522:36.81]We would go out to dinner.
[522:37.83]We would go to friends' houses.
[522:39.47]I drove everywhere.
[522:41.19]Every day, essentially.
[522:43.71]And I've never been in a car accident.
[522:45.11]That wasn't my fault.
[522:46.66]You know what I mean?
[522:49.00]Um... I've never been in a car accident.
[523:05.25]Did I say that right?
[523:06.79]I've never been in a car accident that wasn't my fault.
[523:14.70]I've never been in a car accident that was my fault.
[523:18.77]I've been in a couple of car accidents.
[523:21.04]My car was totaled one time.
[523:22.30]One time when I was living in um... When I moved to Nebraska.
[523:26.76]I pulled up to a red light.
[523:29.06]And I was in just this little shitty sedan.
[523:32.33]And some guy was going like 50 miles per hour and drove over me.
[523:37.73]He was in an SUV and he crushed my car.
[523:41.31]He flipped the fucking car over.
[523:42.84]This is not a joke.
[523:43.66]This really happened.
[523:45.20]And the car fucking... BOOM!
[523:46.78]SMASH!
[523:47.08]I thought the car exploded.
[523:48.08]I really thought my car exploded.
[523:49.96]At a red light.
[523:51.61]I was still looking forward, right?
[523:54.13]So, he flips over.
[523:56.27]Car actually totaled.
[523:58.09]My whole car was destroyed.
[523:59.52]I get out of the car.
[524:00.02]I didn't have a shirt on, by the way.
[524:02.01]I was shirtless.
[524:02.61]I was coming home from work at the time.
[524:04.39]And I had no clothes on.
[524:05.49]And I was just bleeding from my leg.
[524:07.64]Actual real story.
[524:09.60]The guy gets up and he goes, Oh, I didn't see you there.
[524:12.94]And I was like, what the fuck?
[524:13.94]This is the part of the story that is made up from here out.
[524:16.44]And I'm like, what the fuck are you thinking, man?
[524:18.48]And he, like, before I could even see him.
[524:19.64]Because remember, I'm facing him.
[524:21.46]Right?
[524:22.45]So he's looking at me and I'm facing him.
[524:24.85]And all I see in the background, I see his car.
[524:26.83]I see the mangled lights and everything.
[524:29.45]And he points up and he goes, what the fuck?
[524:32.59]I was like, what the, what are you talking about, man?
[524:34.01]He's got this horrified look on his face behind me.
[524:37.20]And remember, because I'm facing him.
[524:39.06]So I turn around, and there's a huge spider sitting on top of the part of the car that he hit.
[524:46.50]And the thing, it was the biggest spider I've ever seen.
[524:48.63]It was probably like a foot and a half long.
[524:50.63]And I was thinking, how the fuck is it even possible that a spider could have, he just hit the car.
[524:56.09]And, like, the cops came and they, like, put handcuffs on the spider and shit.
[524:58.89]And the spider got taken away.
[525:00.66]Because they thought the spider was... Because it looked like a monster.
[525:02.68]They thought that the spider did it.
[525:05.76]And that guy, like, got away with fucking running me over.
[525:10.00]That's probably the biggest spider I've ever seen, though.
[525:11.52]If you're... When... Just for... You know, the guy that asked about it.
[525:20.41]But thanks, man.
[525:26.26]Uh, thank you Jack the Mac for the five dollars.
[525:29.81]Hello, Mr. Vegas, Jerma Defoe.
[525:32.31]Mr. Destructoid, Mr. Destructoid.
[525:36.57]Thank you.
[525:38.87]Uh, thank you Topac for the two bucks.
[525:40.41]It's a shame the green screen suggestions ended.
[525:42.82]I wanted to suggest you recreate this clip when you made a fool of yourself.
[525:49.34]What is that?
[525:53.40]Okay.
[525:56.35]Thank you, Topac, again, for your next big stream.
[525:58.99]You should book an entire theater and get us 3,000 people to watch you live.
[526:03.75]You know how much money that would cost?
[526:10.29]Just think about extras, right?
[526:11.53]Even just extras.
[526:15.32]I used to do extra work.
[526:18.56]Think about how much money that is.
[526:24.00]I got $60 when I was extras in random like indie movies and films and stuff, right?
[526:30.04]So if every extra is looking like they're going to be getting like $60 to $100 for the day, that's very typical, right?
[526:37.17]$60 was pretty much the norm.
[526:42.87]So even if the bare minimum here, like $50 to $60 times $3,000, that's $180,000.
[526:54.79]60 times 3, that's 3,000 people need to be paid.
[526:57.07]That's 200 grand.
[527:02.26]I would need to be making an astronomical amount of money more than I do now.
[527:11.52]Added to the IMDB.
[527:13.67]Well, I mean, I haven't really talked about these before because I didn't really talk about the stuff I used to do.
[527:19.87]But I was on the set of a movie one time, and I was a boy at a camp.
[527:26.72]It was a camp movie.
[527:28.54]It actually wasn't a camp movie.
[527:30.96]But this was in... I spent some time in Wisconsin for a little while.
[527:38.08]And in Wisconsin, there's a lot of woods.
[527:43.94]And in the woods, we set up this whole scene where it was a camp and I was... I essentially ran around this guy who was a janitor cleaning a bathroom.
[527:53.68]And he was the main character and it was me and another kid at the time.
[527:57.09]We were just little extras that they paid and our parents had to be there because we were like 16 or 17 or something.
[528:01.97]So we had to come in and spray each other with squirt guns.
[528:05.85]Running around this guy cleaning the bathroom out in the camp.
[528:09.10]And we, you know, like, get out of here.
[528:10.26]Watch out.
[528:10.88]Oh, idiot.
[528:12.04]And stuff like that.
[528:12.78]And during one of the takes, we did about probably seven or eight takes.
[528:17.29]And it got to the point where the director, he had this weird look in his eye.
[528:21.97]I was shooting and dodging around.
[528:23.91]And, like, the director was like, what the, hold on.
[528:26.71]Wait, wait, cut, cut.
[528:27.57]What the fuck?
[528:28.50]Because I'm looking at him.
[528:30.54]And I'm getting sprayed in the face, but I'm facing him getting direction from him.
[528:35.41]And, uh, he had, like I said, a horrified look in his fucking face.
[528:40.21]And eventually he's like pointing up behind me.
[528:42.95]And I turn around.
[528:45.03]And I went, I shit you not, guys.
[528:47.73]Like one of the biggest, one of the biggest, uh, spiders I've ever seen in my life.
[528:53.14]I mean, this thing was fucking, this thing was as big as the wall.
[528:58.66]It was probably 12 feet tall.
[529:04.25]This thing started smashing the fucking walls down.
[529:08.17]Screaming, like... And, like, people... The main character, he, like, fucking... The spider went down with all of his hands around him.
[529:17.96]All eight legs.
[529:20.44]All around his body.
[529:21.28]And then bit him and fucking ripped him.
[529:27.21]And we just started sprinting around and running around all over the place.
[529:29.89]We were freaking out.
[529:38.48]probably the biggest spider I've ever seen the the guy that was asking that I only spent like maybe a year in wisconsin so
[530:04.78]Once they get past 10 feet, they start making noise.
[530:13.55]That's true, but that's a trope.
[530:15.11]I didn't make that trope up.
[530:16.35]That trope has existed for like 30, 40 years.
[530:26.85]Oh, but thank you.
[530:29.27]Thank you, Topek.
[530:30.79]Thank you, The Jack, for the two bucks.
[530:34.30]The Jack 473 for two bucks.
[530:35.72]Can I quick buy Otto for 54 refined or one key and seven refined?
[530:44.14]He's not for sale.
[530:44.84]I'm sorry.
[530:45.88]Thank you, though.
[530:47.22]Dubsky Dude, thanks for the $1.
[530:48.18]Do you ever read the Germa wiki?
[530:49.74]It's a fantastic repository for Germa lore.
[530:51.99]Speaking of which, when will be getting a new lore for your older characters?
[530:55.83]Glue Man, Bat Boy, and the Egg come to mind.
[530:57.63]I miss them.
[531:03.27]Um...
[531:06.84]I don't know.
[531:08.12]Maybe.
[531:11.34]Give me a little bit of time.
[531:13.34]Let me get some of the first major things that I want to do here done.
[531:18.08]And then there's some other things that I'd like to do.
[531:21.41]But hold on to those characters for now.
[531:26.51]Thank you, DoveskyDude.
[531:28.35]It's time for slime, thanks for the seven dollars it's time for slime.
[531:31.39]I'm so excited for the green screen stream, I'm already working on a crazy try-hard project for it.
[531:36.43]So get pumped.
[531:37.96]Also, I know things are super hectic, but a few months ago you mentioned new shirts possibly and artists working on stuff for them.
[531:43.18]Any updates?
[531:46.46]I do have a new shirt, but it's not ready to be put up yet.
[531:50.69]And I just have to get in contact with a couple of people.
[531:56.35]And the Glue Man shirt... Well, you mentioned Glue Man.
[531:59.29]Let's talk about it.
[532:00.70]The Glue Man shirt is going to come back, and so is the new shirt at the same time.
[532:06.00]So, and I'll do another three-week-long campaign on... Probably on Teespring again.
[532:11.48]And the Glue Man shirt, I'll just redo.
[532:13.32]And it'll be available again.
[532:15.30]And then this other shirt, which is the planets.
[532:19.78]I talked about it a little bit before.
[532:21.62]It's a fucking... Ashley's doing it, and it looks fucking amazing.
[532:26.72]It's the planets, the emotes.
[532:30.56]And it's a great-looking piece of fucking work, so... Just need to...
[532:37.17]Haven't really put much attention to it over the last few weeks, because obviously it's been hard to do that.
[532:42.89]But expect that.
[532:43.81]I'm probably going to say that I'd like to have those two shirts available somewhere around Christmas time.
[532:52.91]Because that's what it was like when I did it the first time.
[532:56.13]It was like, what was it, December 15th through like January 15th or something.
[533:02.49]That same kind of period.
[533:04.98]So, Christmas time this year, expect a couple of shirts.
[533:09.25]And they'll be available.
[533:11.89]They'll probably be the same price that they were last time.
[533:16.33]What was it last time?
[533:17.01]It was 20 bucks, right?
[533:19.42]Yeah, it'll be fucking 20 bucks.
[533:21.92]For each one.
[533:29.98]That's what it was last time, right?
[533:36.43]Because I want to keep the shirt prices down.
[533:38.99]Because I know how rough it can be for international shipping.
[533:43.98]It can be just absolute hell.
[533:47.88]So, instead of like, oh, here's my shirt.
[533:51.06]It's $28 or like $34 or something.
[533:54.12]No.
[533:56.86]Sometimes in shipping costs, you pay so much fucking money.
[533:59.12]I wouldn't want you to be paying like $50 for one of my t-shirts.
[534:09.66]But expect some news on that at some point in December.
[534:16.34]Anywho, that's it for the bits here, except for the last one.
[534:19.52]Zaza Salt, thanks for the $1.
[534:21.33]Not sure if you've seen these yet, but it's my absolute favorite accidental germa moment.
[534:26.41]Accidental germa moment.
[534:29.47]What does that mean?
[534:30.55]What is it?
[534:35.43]Let's watch this on stream.
[534:36.49]Why not?
[534:40.29]Uh, hold on.
[534:40.95]Let me get it in OBS.
[534:47.18]I was shit-faced on this stream.
[534:49.24]I don't even know what this is.
[535:00.37]I've got a couple things to say.
[535:10.19]Hold on, let me put it back here.
[535:12.84]So this is before the stream turned off.
[535:20.10]I've got a couple things to say before the stream turns on.
[535:28.46]What is this?
[535:28.90]So, it's been, uh, it's been... The last couple of years...
[535:39.87]has been, uh, quite a ride.
[535:41.41]I, uh, went live on Twitch for the first time with a stream scheduled two years ago at this very location.
[535:51.13]And, uh, it's been really fun.
[535:54.27]It's been really fun.
[535:55.46]It's been really fun.
[535:56.64]It's been really fun.
[536:07.42]I Said I said so I would that was like right here right about here like it started off as like a little joke and look at look at my face right here like right about here was a
[536:33.87]This was real.
[536:34.84]Like, I was talking from, like, the fucking heart here.
[536:40.08]It started as a little joke, and then right here I'm like, for real.
[536:48.69]You didn't even get to hear it.
[536:50.09]That's unfortunate.
[536:54.77]What a fucking idiot.
[536:59.13]What did I say?
[536:59.71]I was just talking about just how, you know, it's the first time we went live on Twitch.
[537:04.41]We've moved essentially from YouTube to Twitch exclusively over the last couple of years.
[537:08.78]And that I appreciated all the support and that every day I'm going to try as hard as I can to make the videos and streams as good as I can.
[537:17.08]And thank you all for taking this ride with me.
[537:19.16]It was like very emotional.
[537:28.27]But anyways, right at the very end here, Garfield the Monday Killer with $1.
[537:32.37]I can help but feel like Jerma is really not feeling these Garf bits as much as he was back in Monster Rancher 2.
[537:38.27]Jerma, I hope we can find that spark again.
[537:40.45]Don't worry, Jerma.
[537:41.09]The three-minute Jerma movie is almost done.
[537:43.75]That'll revitalize interest in the Garfield brand.
[537:46.82]Anyway, was this the biggest spider you've ever seen?
[537:55.20]Squish.
[538:01.09]I can't even post in my own chat because of the Twitch logout desktop problem.
[538:07.50]So I can't even link this.
[538:10.98]I can't link that.
[538:11.84]I'm not even in my own chat.
[538:15.44]But thank you, Garfield, for your comic strip and your upcoming movie.
[538:20.11]Thank you so much, man.
[538:21.49]Come on.
[538:23.51]I don't hate you, Garfield.
[538:27.27]And with the end of that, we are going to let the sub credits play out here.
[538:35.66]Thank you everybody for subscribing.
[538:38.90]All of you.
[538:40.46]And I'm too quick.
[538:43.46]Y'all rock.
[538:43.92]Thank you so much.
[538:47.05]Show it on stream.
[538:47.85]I could do that.
[538:49.15]And again, I wanted to reiterate one more time that the subs, I'm going to try to think of something to do with subs rather than try to... Because I'm blowing through the sub names at the end of the stream.
[539:02.28]Obviously, I want to show them.
[539:04.58]But I'm going to try to come up with something fun to do with the end of the stream sub stuff.
[539:10.68]I just need to settle here in Vegas and there are a few options.
[539:15.39]So...
[539:16.84]Just for fun.
[539:17.56]Nothing that's that serious.
[539:20.93]But thank you, all of you.
[539:24.53]Turned into a minigame with... But that's... I'm thinking of trying to... I gotta get in touch with some programming people.
[539:30.66]Because there are a couple of fun things that might be worth doing.
[539:33.12]Just... Just because, you know?
[539:38.68]But this channel has received... Here comes the end of the fucking drunk stream speech.
[539:45.88]This channel has seen such ridiculous monetary support over the last year.
[539:51.83]So... Thank you for allowing me to do the things that I do.
[539:57.81]Because it has increased tenfold since even this time last year.
[540:12.09]It surprises me on a daily basis.
[540:13.97]Thank you, everybody.
[540:16.88]I hope you have a fantastic rest of your night or morning, wherever it is.
[540:23.96]And of course, I'll see you probably tomorrow.
[540:31.05]Growing strong.
[540:34.27]Yeah, I don't know.
[540:38.03]I'm just happy to drive around the car, you know what I mean?
[540:44.90]And thank you guys for not only building the car, but for filling it up with gas all the time.
[540:50.28]You know what I mean?
[540:53.14]So, thank you, everybody.
[541:02.31]My tone right now implies the stream's gonna go die in a year and only I know it.
[541:06.47]No, what?
[541:09.49]I didn't move to Las Vegas to, like, it's time to, like, slow it down.
[541:13.84]Yeah, I think I'm going to move to Las Vegas and get in touch with a fucking movie studio and start to, you know what, it's time, yeah, it's time to slow it down.
[541:25.63]No, I'm stepping on the gas, man.
[541:33.19]But you guys are amazing.
[541:36.09]Until next time, see you tomorrow.
[541:39.25]Hopefully.
[541:40.55]And that concludes nine hours.
[541:42.85]Longest one I've done in a long time.
[541:45.45]More Red Dead, same place we left off.
[541:48.44]Probably continue the story a little bit tomorrow.
[541:51.42]And maybe something else.
[541:52.10]We'll see.
[541:52.58]We'll see where the wind takes us.
[541:56.27]Have a great rest of your night.
[541:57.59]Take care, everybody.
[541:59.39]I'll see you soon.
[542:10.84]you
