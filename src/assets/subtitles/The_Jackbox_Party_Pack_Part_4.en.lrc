[00:00.87]So, Jackbox.
[00:04.34]If you're taking off, I'll see you this weekend.
[00:16.75]Thanks for participating.
[00:20.77]Let me open up Jackbox.
[00:24.47]This is going to be loud as shit, isn't it?
[00:25.77]Let me turn it off.
[00:27.68]Party Pack 3, by the way.
[00:40.39]Hey, there it is.
[00:44.18]Jackbox 3.
[00:45.06]Is he going to capture it?
[00:52.74]Come on, man.
[00:56.77]Oh, that doesn't look right.
[01:00.81]Why is it so small?
[01:03.49]Hold on.
[01:04.69]Why is this so small?
[01:09.86]Full screen mode.
[01:10.68]There it is.
[01:17.39]Oh.
[01:17.71]There we go.
[01:18.97]Alright.
[01:20.69]Volume control.
[01:21.37]That's fine.
[01:21.85]Full screen is on.
[01:22.73]Alright.
[01:23.45]So.
[01:25.51]What are we going to do?
[01:27.99]Faking it?
[01:29.73]Quick Blast 2?
[01:31.39]TKO?
[01:31.91]I remember to join the room first.
[01:35.81]I will.
[01:37.17]But first, I need to put a title here.
[01:43.24]Jackbox wind down.
[01:45.65]Get off of just chatting.
[01:53.15]We'll do, yeah, we'll do TKO.
[01:59.80]Turn it up.
[02:02.26]T-K-O.
[02:06.44]Anybody can play.
[02:10.72]We're gonna do turn off full screens.
[02:12.12]I need another window open.
[02:14.22]Uh, we already know this.
[02:15.14]Plays draw three times instead of four.
[02:17.14]And writing time is shorter.
[02:18.32]Yeah, we want that.
[02:19.74]Audience on.
[02:21.16]Audience suggestions.
[02:22.12]While players draw and write, audience can enter suggestions which appear on the screen.
[02:25.06]Meh.
[02:26.16]No extended timers.
[02:27.76]Require Twitch.
[02:28.78]Yes.
[02:29.22]Manual censoring.
[02:30.39]On.
[02:30.55]Allow room code hiding.
[02:33.81]On.
[02:33.97]Okay.
[02:42.64]Here we go.
[02:46.18]I'm not going to do anything.
[02:47.00]There's no rhyme or reason to this one.
[02:50.40]I'm going to dump it into the chat.
[02:51.94]Because we're only going to be able to play one or two of these anyways.
[02:56.36]Change game?
[02:57.12]I did.
[02:58.32]Refresh, refresh, refresh.
[03:02.30]This is taking a while.
[03:03.54]Please check your internet connection.
[03:04.72]What's going on?
[03:06.38]Is Jackbox down too?
[03:11.07]How could Jackbox be down?
[03:19.10]I'm still live, right?
[03:25.05]We're sorry, we can't seem to connect to the Jackbox games server.
[03:29.41]What?
[03:34.72]Uh.
[03:36.87]I'm still haven't dropped any frames right?
[03:39.05]Okay that something fucking real weird is going on here Alright, so I'm gonna turn this off and then I'm gonna put it in the chat I'm gonna join it first And the letter code
[04:06.94]I think I'm just gonna say it.
[04:10.55]I'm just gonna say it, because then there's no advantage.
[04:22.25]Something with me connecting to, like, websites is fucked.
[04:26.84]What the hell is going on here?
[04:30.16]This is really fucking strange.
[04:31.50]Okay.
[04:34.32]Try it again.
[04:38.71]Alright, well, that was weird.
[04:40.71]Okay.
[04:41.41]Are you ready?
[04:42.63]The letters... are... I'm gonna... I'm just gonna say it out loud.
[04:48.14]Here we go.
[04:54.42]W-E-Y-U.
[05:04.24]Hello!
[05:08.00]What do I want to be?
[05:09.74]The fire, of course.
[05:12.62]Alright.
[05:14.70]You can also join if you're in the audience.
[05:17.14]Extra players can join the audience.
[05:18.30]You're both to influence the game.
[05:24.19]You play on your device at jackbox.TV.
[05:26.03]You punch in this code and then you play.
[05:28.37]Here we go.
[05:28.97]You're ready.
[05:29.47]One, two, three.
[05:32.36]Fight.
[05:38.04]Three, two, one.
[05:42.34]That was nerve-wracking.
[05:47.24]I'm just happy to get out of this house.
[05:49.41]Welcome to TKO.
[05:51.81]I am the Tournament Master.
[05:53.59]I'm over 5,000 years old, and I'm on my 200th rewatch of The Wire.
[05:59.02]Louder.
[05:59.20]Chapter 1, Training Grounds.
[06:00.26]Round 1.
[06:18.50]Your winding path to victory starts here at the training grounds.
[06:23.20]You will use your device to draw two drawings.
[06:26.32]Okay.
[06:26.66]Feel free to draw anything that strikes your fancy.
[06:29.92]And if your fancy isn't feeling so fancy, hit the suggestion button.
[06:34.71]It's time for your first drawing right now.
[06:38.41]Okay.
[06:39.19]First drawing.
[06:41.09]Here we go.
[06:41.93]Alright.
[06:42.19]How much time do we have?
[06:43.97]Not a whole lot of time.
[06:45.51]I got to just go.
[06:46.07]Alright.
[06:46.63]Here we go.
[06:47.15]What do I want to do?
[07:20.48]Oh, this sucks.
[07:21.72]Okay.
[07:23.64]How much time?
[07:59.49]Fuck did I wait it didn't
[08:13.22]Do I have to click the button?
[08:15.26]Oh, stoop, you have to click the button.
[08:25.92]I thought it like, no matter what, it just takes what you did.
[08:33.14]Well, I... You have to submit or else nothing submits.
[08:39.24]It should just take what you did.
[08:44.13]Is this just practice?
[08:45.53]I don't think it is.
[08:46.07]This is the second time I've done this.
[08:54.14]This is probably like the twelfth time I've done this.
[08:55.84]It's alright, I got my second drawing in.
[09:00.70]You should just take what you did.
[09:17.03]I have to put this in a different window.
[09:18.85]I'm putting it over here.
[09:19.59]Alright, minimize this window.
[09:41.78]Alright.
[09:44.96]That's not the game's fault, no matter how bad you want it to be, but it still should just do that.
[09:49.94]What about, like, the grandmothers that play this and they don't finish?
[09:52.35]Wait, where's my drawing?
[09:53.69]Good, good.
[09:55.99]Pretty good.
[10:00.59]For your last exercise, you will write as many slogans or phrases as you can.
[10:06.08]These have nothing to do with your drawing, so just put those out of your mind.
[10:10.04]And there's no shame in hitting the suggestion button if you need it.
[10:31.06]You didn't give up after one, did you?
[10:33.10]Keep writing.
[10:38.42]There you go.
[10:39.02]I got it.
[10:42.31]ASMR typing.
[10:51.71]Make haste before time runs out.
[11:03.61]Nice hustle.
[11:04.39]Let's find out how to do it.
[11:05.29]I wrote, like, five.
[11:08.79]Enough training.
[11:10.31]Direct your attention to your device.
[11:12.76]You have a series of drawings and slogans at your disposal.
[11:16.24]Choose one of each to make the best t-shirt champion that you can.
[11:19.62]OK.
[11:20.16]Don't phone it in.
[11:32.72]Why?
[11:33.06]Alright, I'm going to pick this one.
[11:44.46]Yeah, this is where Fireman actually came from.
[11:47.08]Fantastic.
[11:48.54]I can wait no longer.
[11:50.68]Let the tournament begin.
[11:54.53]This is it.
[11:59.13]Why are we here just to suffer versus... Look what you've done.
[12:04.02]I... I don't know.
[12:13.20]That's tough.
[12:16.57]Is that supposed to be Sam and Max over there?
[12:18.41]That's... That's like Scarecrow and Max.
[12:35.23]And this one is taking on... Dermacraft Remastered.
[12:42.24]I mean, it's... Where's the Minecraft in there?
[12:45.16]Mm-mm.
[12:49.50]There's no Minecraft in that t-shirt.
[12:51.94]It's just the sun and clouds and the sky and grass.
[13:00.28]What?! !
[13:10.97]Alright, JermaCraft versus... I can't believe you've done this.
[13:16.05]Uh... That's just... I've seen that video before.
[13:32.63]Alright, JermaCraft cannot win because it has the word Jerma in it.
[13:45.43]I did vote for it.
[13:54.44]What?
[13:55.02]What is going on here?
[14:01.92]Half the t-shirt is JermaCraft related?
[14:11.97]Which do I pick?
[14:22.82]He thinks he's gonna escape Jermaarali.
[14:24.88]What?
[14:25.26]Alright, okay.
[14:34.10]That's... I... That's just like a run-on sentence.
[14:46.31]I...
[14:49.29]I didn't know- I didn't know what to do!
[15:00.90]Run over bitch with 2006 Toyota Highlander.
[15:04.16]I- what?
[15:08.53]It's just a shame.
[15:09.41]Just a damn shame.
[15:21.66]Read it in the Yoda voice.
[15:23.46]Run over.
[15:25.12]With two thousand six three.
[15:27.54]Ah, whatever.
[15:32.79]Oh no, it sizzled over here.
[15:34.03]That means this one wins.
[15:37.07]I win.
[15:40.49]Hey, does anyone know where the bathroom is?
[15:48.86]I'm lactose intolerant and...
[16:06.22]The world's on fire and you're just looking around.
[16:08.05]I don't know where the bathroom is.
[16:17.97]The world's on fire.
[16:19.85]These are the winners?
[16:20.55]No.
[16:20.61]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[16:28.08]Alright, this time I'm not going to fuck around.
[17:21.74]I'm not gonna fuck it up this time, don't worry.
[17:56.67]Time is about to expire.
[18:00.93]You may want to finish up.
[18:05.16]Got it.
[18:06.18]Got it.
[18:06.48]I got it.
[18:06.78]I got it.
[18:07.04]I got it.
[18:07.30]I'm fine.
[18:07.60]I'm fine.
[18:07.82]I got it.
[18:08.08]I got it.
[18:08.32]Don't worry.
[18:13.72]Now right.
[18:28.85]Time goes short, hurry up and finish already!
[18:55.62]Wow!
[18:56.66]I only had two!
[18:58.54]This sucks.
[19:26.95]I'm bad at drawing, so am I. I can't do it for shit.
[19:29.95]That's why I take so long, because I just second-guess everything I do.
[19:38.34]Worma.
[19:38.90]Can I get that in blue?
[19:43.87]Yeah.
[19:47.13]No.
[19:48.23]Can I...
[19:55.11]Where am I?
[19:55.61]Can I get that in blue?
[19:56.77]Versus, yeah.
[19:59.97]This is one of the emoji faces.
[20:15.31]Versus.
[20:16.19]Versus.
[20:19.97]Humana, humana, humana.
[20:26.44]I don't like either one of these.
[20:28.22]What is this?
[20:33.62]Does the audience decide?
[20:34.60]I think they influence.
[20:36.66]If there's a tie.
[20:40.34]I don't even know what this is!
[20:43.34]A new challenger appears!
[21:05.52]Homina, homina, homina.
[21:07.12]Whereas this reality could be whatever I want.
[21:24.36]Oh, yeah!
[21:27.89]Yeah, I know what you did.
[21:44.17]No you don't.
[21:46.43]You don't know shit.
[21:52.41]What?
[21:56.16]No, you guys found out that was the one that I made, so then all of a sudden you want to get rid of it.
[22:31.86]Oh, that's a big, big F coming through.
[22:34.75]Yeah, I know what you did.
[22:39.05]I know what you did is gonna win versus...
[23:05.18]That- I drew that!
[23:10.52]He's lag switching.
[23:12.14]I drew that one.
[23:13.20]A long ti- I- I drew that one.
[23:15.41]Yeah, it's always- it always starts at like 4 o'clock.
[23:27.73]God hates compact streamers.
[23:32.11]The fuck are you talking about?
[23:46.23]If you press pause and unpause, it should catch up.
[23:49.71]Yeah, I actually did, I sent a message to Cox today.
[23:55.57]Saying, god damn it, it's happening again.
[23:58.48]Fix the fucking internet.
[24:00.92]And see if they get back to me today.
[24:03.90]Chapter 5.
[24:19.39]Why would that be the... Better not.
[24:44.69]I don't know if I would wear this shirt.
[24:47.53]I don't think I would put this on.
[24:54.58]Yeah, I know.
[24:58.35]This is like the kitty.
[25:00.75]Funny like cat face.
[25:04.09]Oh, this is tough.
[25:17.27]I had to...
[25:25.66]Does anyone know where the bathroom is?
[25:32.11]What's the next one?
[25:37.89]I don't even want that one available for a shirt.
[25:42.29]I don't want anyone to be able to buy that and wear it.
[25:51.84]Because they'll wear it to a convention and point at it and be like, Hey!
[25:55.94]Hey, dickhead!
[26:01.76]Yeah!
[26:08.43]Yeah, I know what you did.
[26:09.43]The cat won.
[26:15.75]Oh, man.
[26:18.91]We really might, like... We might truly go down, down...
[26:23.57]Thankfully, this is kind of just the end of the stream, like, last hour of the stream anyways.
[26:28.29]This is bad.
[26:28.93]Alright, let's, uh... Should we do another one of these?
[26:39.82]Or should we do one of the other games?
[26:56.73]Another, another.
[26:57.39]Yeah, we'll do another one.
[26:59.03]The other ones go faster anyways.
[27:02.23]So we'll go do a new game.
[27:04.29]Exit.
[27:14.14]Thank you for playing.
[27:16.08]It was fun.
[27:18.12]Should we do, uh, Quiplash?
[27:24.26]Quiplash is good to kind of just...
[27:30.20]We wanted another TKO.
[27:31.62]Yeah, but it takes... I'd rather try to get some... We can do it again.
[27:36.63]I'd rather do one of these that can take less than... Get more people to play.
[27:44.09]And then we can do another TKO.
[27:45.31]Let's change it up.
[27:47.53]Because if the stream might actually just turn off.
[27:51.45]So I want to at least get this one too.
[27:53.73]Because this has been very, very bad the last couple of minutes.
[27:58.89]We'll find out.
[28:02.23]Alright, so make sure the settings are correct.
[28:07.41]That's fine.
[28:08.39]Extended times off.
[28:09.23]Require Twitch.
[28:10.37]Manual censoring.
[28:11.25]Yep, yep, yep.
[28:12.21]Room code.
[28:14.01]So I'm just going to type it.
[28:24.08]And... It's going to be in the screen on your Twitch chat very shortly.
[28:32.91]say it well when I say it I have to type it because everybody will see it at the same time because if I say it people that are on like source will hear it first so usually I would do this in like a Discord or something but we're only gonna do this for like another 20 30 minutes or so what do you mean the same thing
[29:00.69]Alright, if somebody opens the stream and they're not on source, versus people that are here, you know, if... No one's seeing this at the same exact time.
[29:12.53]It's like three or four seconds between people.
[29:18.20]If I put it in chat, you might be watching this stream like a second or two behind.
[29:22.26]Alright, here we go.
[29:29.02]I'm just gonna put it in.
[29:34.78]Do the first three letters?
[29:37.42]Alright, alright, fine.
[29:40.54]No, just, there it is!
[30:03.20]I also typed in G. I don't want to make this weird, but one of you is my secret crush.
[30:09.67]I know.
[30:10.07]Try not to freak out.
[30:11.09]Oh, here's the code for everybody.
[30:12.33]Anyone who wandered in late can use that room code to join the office and affect the game.
[30:18.95]Unfair to me, because I don't know how to read.
[30:20.67]This is round one.
[30:21.53]Fuck!
[30:21.93]You'll see two prompts on your device.
[30:23.99]Answer them any way you want.
[30:28.89]God damn it.
[30:30.11]I was so busy.
[30:30.89]Like, I'm just going to put the code in the chat.
[30:37.82]And like we dropped to zero and I... The stream just like turned off.
[30:44.20]Oh my fucking god.
[30:45.68]I hate this internet so much.
[30:46.86]It's so distracting.
[31:01.56]It just... I literally just saw it.
[31:02.68]It's going to zero again.
[31:03.86]Like right now.
[31:06.35]Motherfuckers.
[31:08.45]Cox motherfuckers.
[31:15.94]I'm sorry, I got distracted.
[31:32.46]I thought he quit because he took the I can't read comment.
[31:34.70]No, I just, I didn't go into the room because I went to zero and I just ran out, I'm just an idiot.
[31:41.40]Ah, this is so frustrating.
[31:43.44]Seriously is.
[31:46.10]$400 a month for this internet.
[31:47.66]You fucking believe that shit?
[31:50.48]$400 fucking dollars a month.
[31:53.32]$400 a month.
[31:55.26]Oh, it's un-fucking-believable.
[31:57.98]I wish I could like sue these motherfuckers, but you just can't.
[32:01.04]Unbelievable.
[32:18.20]It's a scam.
[32:19.04]Yeah, it's called pay for extraordinarily overpriced business internet.
[32:23.84]For them to give you dog shit service like two weeks out of the month.
[32:27.28]It's like that everywhere.
[32:28.30]Fucking everywhere.
[32:32.46]You can move to like three cities in the United States to get like fiber reliably.
[32:36.19]Fucking bunch of dog shit.
[32:40.11]That's so fucking annoying.
[32:41.45]I'm, I'm, I'm, oh, he's actually, oh, I'm actually mad.
[32:45.61]actually mad you're hearing like real actual mad can we do this all the time it doesn't matter what city you go to it's everywhere I was talking to people before I was talking to a couple of streamers that are like hey my internet's so bad should I like where should I move it's like it doesn't matter
[33:12.21]You can go anywhere!
[33:13.71]It's like this in California, it's like this in fucking Nevada, it's like this in Boston, it doesn't matter where you go.
[33:18.64]You can go to like, Austin and get Google Fiber.
[33:21.46]Alright.
[33:22.30]Everyone's gonna move to Austin.
[33:26.62]I'm not gonna move to EU.
[33:35.31]What a pain in the dick.
[33:37.27]Alright, here we go.
[33:38.33]I'm gonna punch it in.
[33:40.41]We'll do the first three letters this time.
[33:41.79]I'm sorry, guys.
[33:42.69]I'm just distracted by this bullshit.
[33:49.37]Here we go!
[33:57.06]Here comes the first three letters.
[33:58.22]U-R-S
[34:26.17]Internet.
[34:32.43]I think everybody's in.
[34:34.07]Here is now the code.
[34:35.55]For you to see.
[34:36.01]It's just, it's so normal to have shitty internet in North America.
[34:41.81]And it's incredibly expensive.
[34:53.72]Fuck me.
[34:54.80]Pain in the ass.
[34:58.28]How did they guess?
[34:59.06]There's only one out of 26 chance.
[35:00.06]So upset I got him the first time.
[35:01.28]I'm really sorry.
[35:01.84]It's my fault.
[35:02.22]I'm sorry about that.
[35:03.20]I really am.
[35:24.67]Alright, here we go.
[35:26.85]Attention audience, while you wait for these annoyingly slow players, why not try the audience play along?
[35:54.69]Okay, that's it.
[35:57.12]Oh shit!
[35:57.72]I forgot about the audience!
[36:09.01]I forgot, you can write anything.
[36:20.48]It's just chat?
[36:21.24]Wait, I thought that people could just write anything they wanted and it could do like the most... I think, yeah, I think you can.
[36:37.25]Yeah, you can.
[36:38.25]Almost out of time.
[36:39.55]Use the safety quip button if you have to.
[36:43.41]Fucking internet, internet, internet, internet.
[36:44.93]Gonna make my own damn internet.
[36:50.85]Let's start this show.
[36:52.77]Number one on the list, a bad name for a proctologist.
[36:56.75]Bad name for a proctologist.
[36:58.12]Doctor... Doctor Yucky Gross.
[37:02.98]Doctor... Oh, Doctor Ass.
[37:19.25]Dr. Jock-a-Groats.
[37:28.48]Wait, not like Dr. Schweikson?
[37:30.28]Why is Dr. Schweikson?
[37:32.16]Shouldn't be there.
[37:34.06]Up next, the name of a nursery rhyme that's guaranteed to give your kid nightmares.
[37:39.39]Vote on your devices.
[37:47.09]Here comes Worma, or Baa Baa Depressed Sheep.
[37:57.84]Uh... I don't know.
[38:00.14]I mean, that one's pretty horrifying.
[38:03.72]I don't know why you give a child that.
[38:12.27]They would probably be very, very upset.
[38:16.47]The name of a bra for dogs.
[38:19.11]Bra for D-Pup.
[38:44.78]That was when I was mid-meltdown.
[38:46.80]Alright, give me some credit here.
[38:49.20]I was very upset about the internet.
[38:51.02]I just had to write something.
[38:53.24]Like a bra, a dog bra, I don't know.
[38:59.94]Tiny high bee-ing living.
[39:02.76]Honey, I shrunk the furniture.
[39:21.61]That's pretty clever.
[39:23.33]Pretty clever.
[39:27.37]Get the laugh track.
[39:31.27]I don't...
[40:08.85]Dude, I was in the middle of being angry.
[40:13.11]These two weren't done.
[40:14.82]This is not my prime here.
[40:35.78]Canada doesn't even have better internet.
[40:39.38]Canada has, I think, worse internet than the United States.
[40:51.25]Moving on.
[40:52.77]A good reason to give a restaurant a zero star review.
[40:56.73]Says he was caught.
[40:57.63]I know, right?
[40:58.23]Okay, vote.
[41:00.41]A good reason to give a restaurant a zero star review.
[41:02.75]They served Otto or no garlic bread.
[41:06.93]You mean like they served Otto food?
[41:11.15]They served dogs in the restaurant?
[41:14.72]And somebody saw that and thought it was disgusting?
[41:16.28]And they're like, why would they be dogs at the table?
[41:28.89]I would have given a place zero stars if they didn't have garlic bread.
[41:30.89]That's fucked up.
[41:31.59]Next is... Everybody who buys a jet ski gets a personal card that says this.
[41:38.00]Vote now.
[41:41.32]Anybody that buys a jet ski has a personal card that says this.
[41:44.44]Wave.
[41:45.14]Hi.
[41:46.62]Or certified gamer license.
[41:48.20]What would you have a gamer license for?
[41:50.20]I mean...
[42:00.81]You don't need a gamer license to ride a jet ski.
[42:04.11]It's not a game.
[42:04.83]Yes, it is.
[42:06.55]Everything can be a game.
[42:13.62]That's true.
[42:14.10]There's a chat meme.
[42:15.08]I know.
[42:28.09]I'm ready for this one.
[42:29.67]Here we go.
[42:29.97]Okay.
[42:54.99]Fuck.
[42:55.93]I'm here, I'm here.
[43:27.18]I put the funny, epic, edgy joke.
[43:33.47]No fun allowed.
[43:34.35]Yeah, this is a... This is not an open world stream.
[43:37.13]This is a closed world stream.
[43:50.65]Choices don't matter.
[43:52.35]No, choices, yeah.
[43:52.87]Your choices...
[44:00.13]Alright, here we go.
[44:00.73]I'm gonna get monumental points here.
[44:08.17]Yeah, forced stealth would be me putting on slow mode.
[44:12.43]Sub only mode.
[44:13.79]A wise old saying your grandma taught you, look before you leap, look before you buy lottery tickets in Nevada.
[44:28.54]That's just a saying.
[44:32.56]That's a callback to me not understanding that I couldn't purchase lottery tickets in Nevada because there's no state lottery.
[44:39.03]So, like, actually physically look and physically find out if I can actually do that before doing it.
[44:44.99]So that's pretty good.
[44:46.34]That's a pretty good one.
[44:54.70]I think that wins the game.
[44:56.77]Thank you for explaining the jokes.
[45:05.04]Well, there may not have been people here on that stream.
[45:11.20]So, you know, you have to tell somebody.
[45:14.38]Make sure the previous owner didn't move away to Las Vegas.
[45:16.67]Leave wasps in their walls.
[45:31.24]don't understand this well let me tell you so I I moved next on the list the sequel to Shakespeare in love would be called Shakespeare in blank time to vote
[46:02.06]Which one is it?
[46:02.68]Which one's it gonna be?
[46:08.33]I got the audience.
[46:09.37]I got the audience on that one.
[46:17.47]What is the dark secret of Frosty the Snowman?
[46:21.03]He has bones on the inside.
[46:22.17]Isn't made of snow.
[46:31.41]What is that supposed to mean?
[46:33.26]What do you mean, not made of snow?
[46:40.10]What else would you be made out of?
[46:51.87]Cocaine.
[46:56.02]You wouldn't be able to clump them together.
[46:57.83]It would be awesome if you could grow blank in a garden.
[47:01.21]Get to voting!
[47:03.89]It would be awesome if you could grow cool person in a garden or garlic bread in a garden.
[47:17.43]I mean, either one of those would be pretty awesome, I guess.
[47:25.83]This already- this IS a thing!
[47:31.41]I-
[47:56.68]What are you talking about?
[47:58.00]A tuber?
[48:05.31]We're at the highest death rate.
[48:08.91]I could take care of myself just fine.
[48:18.02]Thank you very much.
[48:18.96]Put in your votes.
[48:26.74]You're in a hurry.
[48:34.81]More bras.
[48:39.17]Watermelons, yeah.
[48:45.60]Come on.
[48:57.12]You're better than that.
[48:58.60]No, I'm not.
[49:05.38]What a turtle looks for in a mate.
[49:08.77]Oh, we're getting political.
[49:11.47]It just got political.
[49:13.37]It just got political.
[49:30.64]How quickly could you stuff a watermelon in a bra?
[49:33.46]I don't know.
[49:34.70]Depends on how big it was.
[49:35.74]Aren't you supposed to be the funny guy?
[49:37.56]I use my funny powers when I deem it necessary.
[49:44.38]There's just one prompt and you're all getting it.
[50:02.91]Make up the full name for this acronym.
[50:06.65]Full name for this acronym.
[50:48.12]I don't know!
[50:48.80]I don't know!
[50:49.63]No, that doesn't make any sense.
[51:07.67]That doesn't make any sense.
[51:08.51]Mine makes no sense.
[51:09.45]I don't even know, and it's probably, it might, it might win.
[51:14.28]Choose the medal-winning quips.
[51:36.04]Yeah, that way there's an O in these things.
[51:37.88]There's an O in that one.
[51:59.61]Great, let's see where those medals ended up.
[52:01.85]First, the bronze.
[52:04.37]Silver.
[52:06.41]And now the gold.
[52:08.85]Now we transform those metals into points.
[52:17.40]Jeremiah, what the fuck?
[52:20.44]I was trying to go for the click.
[52:21.96]I was trying to go for the clicks.
[52:28.42]It's over.
[52:29.00]Let's see the final scores.
[52:37.44]Alright, fourth place.
[52:38.16]I still get... I still get to go on to the next Mario Kart track.
[52:43.42]I'm gonna keep being Koopa Troopa.
[52:56.41]Still lost?
[52:57.09]Well, I mean, but what if I'm in first place next time?
[53:00.49]And I get more points than Mario does, and I end up getting the trophy.
[53:03.79]After three or four more.
[53:04.57]Alright, let's do...
[53:09.76]You lost to three people who are good at guessing letters?
[53:12.60]That means that they're, like, they have swiftness.
[53:18.82]Alright, so, we're gonna do the t-shirt one again.
[53:21.68]And then I gotta get out of here.
[53:24.96]Because I have to get ready and I have to go pick up somebody at the airport.
[53:28.80]So, I gotta get out of here.
[53:32.12]Let's do the t-shirt one again.
[53:35.01]Thank you for playing, guys.
[53:46.47]Wait, what are you doing?
[53:48.65]I wanna exit.
[53:54.35]Alright, I'm gonna do a good one this time, just you wait.
[53:59.53]So this one, we will... ...exclusivize this one.
[54:04.73]I'm gonna put this... I'll give you some time, don't worry.
[54:07.44]I'm gonna put this in the sub-Discord channel.
[54:11.78]Okay?
[54:16.59]Gonna do three letters again in the sub-Discord channel.
[54:24.91]I'll give you time to pay to win.
[54:28.58]Well, it was one out of three pay to win.
[54:31.94]Two out of three for free.
[54:33.92]Alright, let me just get it started.
[54:47.30]Let's get this off the screen, and I'm going to put it in that Discord.
[54:52.90]I'm going to have the first letter missing.
[54:55.42]Okay?
[55:01.29]The first letter is going to be missing in the Discord.
[55:04.37]I'll give you an opportunity to get in there, if you want to.
[55:07.11]If you're available.
[55:09.94]I am now in.
[55:15.58]Okay.
[55:17.22]Ready?
[55:17.64]First letter's gonna be missing.
[55:19.74]Or, no, yeah, the first... That's actually kind of... Yeah, that's better.
[55:25.34]First letter will be missing.
[55:34.50]Okay.
[55:35.52]Here.
[55:36.66]We.
[55:38.00]Go.
[55:38.72]This is the last three letters.
[55:42.13]Remember, last three letters.
[55:44.88]I will give you a dash just so you remember.
[55:57.59]Somebody got it.
[56:00.71]Somebody else got it.
[56:02.35]There's still plenty of room here.
[56:06.09]One more slot.
[56:08.72]Oh, somebody got it.
[56:16.46]There it is.
[56:18.30]It was O-P-K-H.
[56:30.71]Alright, I'm gonna draw something very good this time.
[56:32.69]We ready?
[56:39.87]Three, two, one, let's start.
[56:44.24]Oh, well there's your countdown.
[56:53.58]How about you give us the code and you have to guess the first letter?
[56:57.57]I'm not sure that would be a thing that would work.
[57:05.55]I brought you to T-Shirt Island to engage in deadly T-shirt combat.
[57:11.26]Each of you has the heart of a true warrior, which you'll find in a jar under your seat.
[57:16.48]Can we skip this?
[57:17.36]Or save it for later.
[57:26.08]Alright, I know exactly what I'm doing.
[57:27.73]I don't think we can skip the intro.
[58:27.33]how do I undo 40 seconds
[59:06.84]Got it.
[59:09.88]I'm done.
[59:12.84]This game is so cute, it is very cute.
[59:15.43]It's a very nice little game.

[60:37.16]Alright, that's done.
[60:37.98]Done.
[60:38.50]I don't even need to do it anymore.
[60:39.28]Let's go.
[60:43.26]Oh, here comes Jermacraft.
[60:52.24]What if we all just did Jermacraft?
[60:54.77]Every single one.
[61:00.53]I'm glad I said that after this was done, so then people wouldn't have the opportunity to do it.
[61:07.71]Mine is so bad.
[61:08.47]So is mine.
[61:09.37]Don't worry.
[61:09.79]They're all going to be bad.
[61:11.15]Here we go.
[61:38.85]You didn't give up after one, did you?
[61:40.87]Keep writing.
[61:41.77]Time is about to expire.
[62:01.17]You may want to finish up.
[62:10.29]Fuck, I almost had four.
[62:10.97]Zero?
[62:11.47]One?
[62:11.69]I don't... Oh my god.
[62:12.61]I'm so disappointed.
[62:39.41]I'm disappointed.
[62:54.16]Sorry, Dad.
[62:54.90]It's okay.
[63:00.78]You can turn off training in the settings?
[63:02.23]Oh, shit.

[63:03.23]Well, sorry about that.
[63:04.01]Thanks for the tip.
[63:05.55]Let the tournament begin.
[63:07.47]I'm disappointed in you, too.
[63:10.32]It's okay.
[63:12.22]Let's go.
[63:14.20]Rat Movie 3 will never be released as an Angry Rainbow versus Yeet Me Into the Grave.
[63:20.69]I don't know what this is.
[63:47.72]Oh boy, that one was burnt up.
[63:55.25]Alright, Rat Movie Rainbow versus... Scoff at him.
[63:59.31]Mom, can you pick me up?
[64:00.33]I'm scared.
[64:08.79]Scoff at him.
[64:12.01]That's just Lightning Man.
[64:19.05]Oh man, Lightning Man coming in, I guess.
[64:26.95]Fire Man 2.
[64:29.49]That's just Fire Man shaved, and like, started going to the gym.
[64:34.93]Uh...
[64:55.91]Zap Man or Riot.
[64:57.11]Doesn't look like it.
[64:57.95]Sorry guys.
[65:03.31]I do like the little Zap guy though.
[65:07.09]Six Flags.
[65:11.32]Six Flags?
[65:26.22]Who is that?

[65:36.80]Yes!
[65:37.40]Alright, I get it.
[65:38.84]Oh, what?
[65:39.60]What?!
[65:42.06]This is mine!
[65:42.72]I didn't even want it to win!
[65:56.86]Telling the truth.
[65:58.34]Mon, can you pick me up?
[66:02.48]Uh, this is... I'm conflicted here.
[66:04.44]Because these are both mine.
[66:09.28]I drew the one on the right.
[66:16.84]I picked the text for this one, and then I drew the one on the right.
[66:23.30]I believe in Otto.
[66:24.48]What the fuck is that?
[66:38.10]I believe in Otto!
[66:54.85]Alright, I believe in Otto versus...
[66:59.96]fight each other.
[67:28.73]No, I'm not giving you guys an opportunity for everyone to click Sans.
[67:34.32]I'm sorry.
[67:34.90]I wanted Sans.
[67:36.56]No.
[67:36.64]No, we're not gonna have a Sans...
[69:03.56]Alright, I'm ready.
[69:05.58]Time goes short.
[69:06.44]Hurry up and finish it.
[69:15.44]I want the funny skeleton character.
[69:23.08]Now, right.
[70:01.31]Time is about to expire.
[70:02.80]You may want to finish up.
[70:05.66]Fuck, I almost got it.
[70:08.76]As we approach the second gauntlet, the cruel winds of chance have switched around your drawings and slogans.
[70:15.39]You know what to do.
[70:17.43]Make a shirt.
[70:44.17]What has he made?
[70:45.33]I love how you save one game and then you get sucked in.
[70:52.23]Well, it's fun.
[70:54.27]It's fun just to play these weird little things.
[70:59.15]You're... What does it say?

[71:01.13]What is it?
[71:01.94]Apple?
[71:04.30]The great pet... Do you remember... That's a Sans, though.
[71:08.88]That's a Sans.
[71:09.54]Uh, what is it?
[71:12.34]The great pet... I don't know what this is.
[71:14.24]You're grounded.
[71:15.16]What does this say?
[71:15.92]Uh, okay.
[71:21.17]That's a Sans.
[71:21.69]That's Sans.
[71:34.43]I'm just kidding.
[71:40.35]You crack me up, little buddy.
[71:41.77]What does that say?
[71:44.37]Can we zoom in on that?
[71:45.43]Well, this is you guys.
[71:49.88]Does it say Sans?
[71:53.36]I don't know what that says.
[71:56.64]Six flags.

[72:07.24]He's calling me at the worst time.
[72:12.30]That's Sans!
[72:13.96]That's a Sans eye!
[72:17.14]Okay.

[72:29.82]Oh, the airport!
[72:31.26]Oh, my friend!
[72:32.24]No.
[72:32.92]Don't worry.
[72:35.26]Late to the imagine?
[72:36.34]That'd be so awful.
[72:39.12]Hey dude, where the fuck are you?
[72:40.30]I've been waiting in the terminal for like two hours.
[72:41.94]Oof.
[72:54.84]A new challenger appears.
[73:00.13]It's like the circus is in downwards.
[73:01.67]I'm sorry, I'm not good enough.
[73:13.26]There goes the cat.
[73:15.30]Oh well.
[73:36.50]Burger versus channel meme which one I'm not sure This is actually gonna be 50-50 I think Burger it is
[74:02.88]What?
[74:05.55]How?
[74:06.11]How's that possible?
[74:06.79]Oh, great.
[74:09.41]And it even has this on the bottom, too.
[74:36.44]A new challenger appears
[75:05.86]Alright, I got a confession to make.
[75:11.24]I drew the sands and I did the AAAA.
[75:15.16]I was hoping somebody was gonna get it and put them together.
[75:16.94]Center.
[75:35.41]I was trying to debate the win.
[75:36.85]Uh-oh, this is tough.
[75:43.95]Oh, come on.
[75:44.47]Versus, like, the flexing guy at the gym?
[75:55.86]Censors others, then makes his own.
[75:57.46]Like, censors, then steals and says it's his original content.
[76:04.77]Come on.
[76:08.16]Well, 128 of you.
[76:08.64]A smart.
[76:09.30]You know, he's smart.
[76:14.74]Oh, and what's that?
[76:15.44]That's mine.
[76:16.08]I win.
[76:21.34]I want you to fight.
[76:34.01]Burger versus Zap, man.
[76:38.82]Sorry, I'm not good enough.
[76:40.04]Uh-oh, what's the auto?
[76:42.14]Oh, no, this is the new little guy.
[76:44.08]That's a very good burger, though.
[76:47.06]That's a very steady hand.
[76:53.63]What's the last one?
[76:55.05]Ooh.
[76:58.85]I forgot about I believe in auto.
[77:12.32]The Clash of the Titans, yeah.
[77:13.80]Uh-oh.
[77:16.60]That's it.
[77:21.50]I believe in Otto.
[77:25.53]That shirt sucks.
[77:26.87]Choose Zapman.
[77:29.49]I believe in Otto.
[77:30.39]Show Otto.
[77:32.55]Otto?
[77:52.26]Can you just chill it out and have a good time?
[77:56.14]Hello, good dog.
[78:03.61]Okay.
[78:10.67]Look up, I tell you.
[78:15.19]I tell you.
[78:16.84]He doesn't want to look up.
[78:17.64]I have to like point this down.
[78:23.74]What's that, Otto?
[78:25.18]What's this?
[78:25.52]Hello, Otto.
[78:29.08]What's going on over here?
[78:31.58]Otto.
[78:32.94]Hey.
[78:34.76]Otto.
[78:34.92]He's like, what are you doing?
[78:37.26]Otto.
[78:39.64]Look over there.
[78:40.28]He's like, I don't want to look over there.
[78:45.72]I don't want to look over there.
[78:46.98]He's too sleepy.
[78:50.56]He really is just like, no.
[78:53.55]He's so cute.
[78:57.97]Okay, sleepy dog.
[78:59.77]Come here.
[79:01.01]Over here, dog.
[79:12.58]Shaggy and Scooby.
[79:16.63]Now show Shito.
[79:17.81]Oh, right.
[79:18.35]Give me a Shito.
[79:21.55]Look at how long my fucking nails are.
[79:22.95]Holy shit, what a psycho.
[79:27.77]I could, like, go do Wolverine tryouts with these things.
[79:30.28]I'm gonna take care of that after this stream.
[79:39.17]Alright, that is gonna be it.
[79:47.84]Click here to share or buy these shirts if you really, really feel like doing that.
[79:56.17]I'm gonna post the link here.
[79:57.47]This is a link to all the shirts if anyone is going to purchase any of these.
[80:03.71]Here they are.
[80:10.22]They're pretty much all here from this past round.
[80:16.09]Uh, Yoda was not... I didn't draw that.
[80:18.40]That was a fake drawing.
[80:20.10]Because I ran out of time.
[80:21.16]Uh, did anybody have a link from the last round?
[80:29.72]In TKO?
[80:30.22]Because that one had Yoda on it.
[80:35.89]Thanks for playing, guys.
[80:39.73]There's the... Okay, there it is from the last one.
[80:41.07]Cool.
[80:41.17]Cool.
[80:42.53]Alright, everybody.
[80:44.02]I will see you guys on Saturday.
[80:47.34]I'm going to call it here.
[80:48.04]I have to get ready and then get to the airport.
[80:56.11]Do Jackbox some other time?
[80:57.11]Yeah, it pops up from time to time.
[80:58.35]This stream was fucking... My throat hurts from laughing at that robot in the beginning, the first few hours.
[81:05.49]And it's always fun to play Jackbox and chill and hang out and have a good time.
[81:10.73]So I will see you guys on Saturday.
[81:12.07]That's the next time you will see this stream activated.
[81:18.02]Appreciate everybody for hanging out.
[81:22.40]And we only had, like, one real, like, streamer meltdown about the internet.
[81:26.56]That's the first.
[81:27.64]No?
[81:28.30]No, I'm not gonna let that ruin my good time.
[81:33.84]It was fucking a ton of fun.
[81:36.66]But yeah, I'll see you guys soon.
[81:38.04]We'll do the bits and the subs.
[81:41.86]Let's get them on the screen.
[81:43.24]Why not?
[81:45.30]I need... There it is.
[81:50.56]There's chat, too.
[81:53.24]Thank you, everybody.
[81:54.18]Thank you to, especially, to these people.
[82:01.28]Go back a few hours ago here.
[82:03.80]We had a bunch of community subs, too.
[82:09.02]Thank you to another maple.
[82:12.69]Happy birthday, another maple.
[82:16.51]Happy 19th birthday.
[82:18.17]To another maple.
[82:20.37]Uh, some guy, thanks for the five dollars.
[82:22.09]Hey, so how about that children's book deal?
[82:23.71]Don't worry, I haven't forgotten about it.
[82:26.35]Children's book deal?
[82:32.68]Nine o'clock?
[82:36.10]Daylight.
[82:40.36]What day?
[82:45.34]I don't even know what that is.
[82:48.70]It's like everybody's a Scrooge yelling at Tiny Tim out the window.
[83:09.97]Uh, thank you some guy for the five dollars.
[83:11.83]Uh, thank you Arkin for the three bucks.
[83:14.35]Just wanted to let you know that I love you, man.
[83:16.15]It's been tough to catch your streams as I'm currently on an exchange from Australia to Finland.
[83:21.30]Probably be asleep by the time you read this, so mind wave me some good dreams.
[83:25.82]Will do.
[83:26.14]Uh, thank you so much for the three bucks and... Australia to Finland.
[83:34.73]That's pretty long ways away.
[83:41.72]Thank you so much for the three bucks.
[83:45.42]And you're on exchange from Australia to Finland.
[83:49.09]If you get this, maybe give us an update.
[83:50.45]What for?
[83:50.77]What are you doing?
[83:53.89]That sounds interesting.
[83:56.09]But thank you.
[83:58.59]Thank you, TheJack, for the 280.
[83:59.47]The AI recognizes people as well, so if you type in Todd Howard, it will talk about Skyrim.
[84:04.75]You can write in screen writing style, so do your silly little voices.
[84:09.78]I might have to play with that again.
[84:17.37]Should I type Jerma?
[84:18.23]I typed Jerma a few times.
[84:21.21]It just gave us weird responses.
[84:22.67]It gave us weird chat logs every time I would put my name in.
[84:29.67]Thank you Growlithe for the five bucks.
[84:32.01]Been having a rough week and this stream is exactly what I needed.
[84:34.55]Been watching you for years.
[84:36.01]Love everything you do.
[84:36.67]Keep being you.
[84:39.31]Thank you for the five bucks and for the really, really nice fucking thing to say.
[84:44.81]Thank you.
[84:47.90]Hope you have a better week.
[84:53.46]Happy to be able to hang out and, you know, at least have fun, right?
[85:01.19]Tingy, thanks for the $2.50, Tingy.
[85:02.55]Is this where B.F. Bugleberry got his Halloween stories?
[85:04.91]No, I wrote the entire Halloween story.
[85:06.93]The last one, I wrote the whole thing.
[85:09.81]Bugleberry's, like, four-page Halloween story about, like, the Loud Man.
[85:14.13]I just, I wrote the whole thing.
[85:22.67]It was dogshit.
[85:24.31]But I still did it.
[85:28.23]Thank you, though.
[85:31.09]That was earlier, a couple hours ago.
[85:37.86]We also had two $100 bit drops from Smotherum and Lexi.
[85:44.26]Thank you, both of you, for your huge amounts of money.
[85:48.52]I think I missed Reim.
[85:50.78]ReimTV gave five community subs an hour and a half ago or so.
[85:56.45]Thank you, Reim, for your sub drop here.
[86:01.14]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $2.50.
[86:04.50]Holy shit, Jerma, this stream was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
[86:07.08]That E3 bit absolutely slayed me.
[86:09.16]BRB, you need to wipe the tears from my eyes.
[86:12.23]Dude, some of those Six Flags... The Six Flags one with the Great Wall of China was seriously, like, I... I wish, like I said, I wish I could, like, eat that image.
[86:25.81]What, like, a fun thing.
[86:27.01]What a fun thing.
[86:32.06]Mario, yeah, there were some really fun ones.
[86:35.31]Tales from the Tomb Raider.
[86:44.09]Thank you krys for the $5.
[86:47.51]Time to play GeoGuessr.
[86:51.65]No, we're taking a GeoGuessr break.
[86:55.57]But thank you for the $5.
[86:56.57]Thank you, Jess, you got it for the $2.50.
[86:58.05]Here's my contribution to the lawyer fund so you can sue Cox.
[87:01.16]Did I say I was going to sue Cox?
[87:06.37]I turned into, like, a fireball for, like, 45 seconds.
[87:08.63]I don't even remember.
[87:09.53]What did I say?
[87:16.09]The volcano erupted inside of my body, and I said that, like, what did I say?
[87:19.67]Fuck cocks, I want to sue him.
[87:30.63]Jesus Christ.
[87:33.05]He said, you wish you could sue them.
[87:34.53]Oh.
[87:37.04]Oh, those motherfuckers.
[87:38.10]I'm about to sue them.
[87:40.98]I can't contain my rage.
[87:44.08]It's impossible.
[87:52.62]He kept repeating 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400.
[87:53.68]Oh, God.
[88:06.38]You used motherfucker twice in a sentence.
[88:13.10]It was the most genuinely angry I've ever heard you.
[88:20.05]That's so fucking ridiculous.
[88:23.93]Get a business line with him?
[88:25.21]That's what I have.
[88:27.79]I have a business line from Cox.
[88:32.03]That is the business package.
[88:36.35]I already have it and it don't matter.
[88:45.88]Why business?
[88:46.60]Because if you have residential internet and you have a problem, they send the residential technicians and they don't really care.
[88:55.45]They tell you to turn your modem off and on again when they have packet loss and noise ingress in their line going to the plant.
[89:04.42]So if you do not have a business line from one of these internet companies, they do not fix your problem.
[89:15.98]And the thing about uptime guarantees is they... For when I'm streaming, right?
[89:21.68]So let's say I drop like 20,000 frames on a stream and like it fucks up every 10 minutes or so.
[89:28.29]That's still technically, they can still spin it.
[89:30.59]Whereas, well, yeah, but I mean, it's still 99% up.
[89:34.05]What about the times when you're not streaming and you're using the internet on the line?
[89:38.01]So technically in a 24 hour day, these like 30 to 40,000 frames a drop, it doesn't matter.
[89:44.26]Like that's still part of their like uptime.
[89:53.24]No, they don't give a shit.
[89:54.88]They never will.
[89:59.73]The people that are on the ground level do care.
[90:02.83]It's kind of funny because you'll talk to some of these technicians that are like, you know, they come out and they try to service and they try to figure out what's wrong.
[90:10.10]And there are people above those people who are above those people who are above those people.
[90:17.60]So it doesn't matter.
[90:19.83]Somebody has to figure out what they want to do about it.
[90:23.59]And it's not the person that comes to your house.
[90:28.54]That person cannot fix your problem.
[90:31.40]They can tell someone else that it exists and then that person has to deem if it's necessary for them to fix it and tell the next person to do so.
[90:44.65]So getting upset or angry at the technician that comes out is just wasted breath because that person cannot even fix your problem.
[90:52.71]All they can do is start the chain.
[90:59.88]It ends up being a game of telephone, which is why, fortunately for this particular location, every time there's been a problem, the... Thank you.
[91:13.79]Every time there's been a problem, like a real addressable problem where, you know, 20, 30, 40 thousand drop frames per stream for a week,
[91:22.01]this guy that I have a contact with does fix it like he does do what he can and he does get them to do it but that process to get there took like six months of getting that guy that you can talk to so you can get a business contact with cox it's like having a representative of the company that knows you we used to offer those to our property managers yeah it's
[91:52.36]It's just hard.
[91:52.96]It's hard because there's so many employees, there's so many customers that it's just impossible to stay on top of it, no matter where you are.
[92:05.90]But it's all good.
[92:07.06]Obviously, I'm going to fly off the handle sometimes when it ruins a stream, right?
[92:13.78]Because when your stream goes to zero and you get a buffer and you have to refresh the page, that fucks up the stream.
[92:21.58]That takes my mind and all of our collective good time we're having into... Oh, well, hold on a minute.
[92:30.53]Hold on, hold on.
[92:31.47]Give me like two, three minutes.
[92:33.29]Okay, are we through it?
[92:36.21]Okay, can you hear me?
[92:37.85]Can you hear me?
[92:38.29]Okay, good.
[92:40.04]It's just an inconsistent fucking mess.
[92:44.80]They know.
[92:45.58]It breaks the immersion.
[92:46.44]Well, it's just not fun when you're interrupted every two or three minutes.
[92:53.00]When you get in a groove and then you look over and you see the red zero, it's like, well, better quiet, better stop talking for 30 seconds and see what happens.
[93:08.99]And it's almost like, yeah, it's almost like, I'm sure you guys have noticed, when there's internet problems start happening, let's say they happen for like an hour or so, right?
[93:16.69]That hour is me trying to dance around frame drops.
[93:23.28]And it impedes on the stream, it fucks with the stream, because then whatever I was doing previously, now I have to think in the back of my mind, and glance over to the right here, to my OBS to see when I drop down,
[93:33.94]When can I stop talking?
[93:35.52]Should I just... I'm dead here.
[93:39.07]Refresh.
[93:39.79]It's a pain in the ass.
[93:43.23]Rather than just focusing on what we're doing.
[93:45.21]It really, really, really is annoying.
[93:51.12]But like I said, I'm not going to let that ruin my good times.
[93:55.88]I said my piece.
[93:57.50]I said it for about a minute or two.
[93:58.56]We moved on.
[94:00.37]And it's been up.
[94:06.68]I'm not gonna let it ruin the good time.
[94:07.77]Today was a ton of fucking fun.
[94:09.05]I'm not gonna let that sour a really, really fun day.
[94:13.61]So.
[94:15.71]Hope it didn't for you either.
[94:19.31]Let's keep going.
[94:29.82]We were at... Where is it?
[94:35.95]Here we were.
[94:37.80]It was just you got it for the $2.50.
[94:38.88]Here's my contribution to the lawyer fund.
[94:40.52]That's what started that.
[94:47.65]Creation come undone.
[94:48.87]Thanks for the $10.
[94:50.75]Hi, Jerma.
[94:51.13]I'm the guy who originally suggested talk to Transformer during the Days Gone stream.
[94:54.39]Hope you had fun.
[94:55.74]Sometimes all it takes is one guy.
[94:57.14]That's true.
[95:03.60]All it takes is one guy.
[95:05.12]It was a great suggestion.
[95:06.56]I had never even heard of it.
[95:09.85]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[95:13.69]Yeah.
[95:13.89]Yeah.
[95:38.36]But here's like the worst part about this is... If there's, let's just, let's say that there are, like I said, like a handful of American cities that have reliable fiber or, you know, best internet in the country, reliable everywhere.
[95:57.47]It really doesn't matter because you could have like Massachusetts, like Boston has the best internet, apparently, like it's in the top 10 or something for internet in the country.
[96:09.20]But I had problems all the fucking time.
[96:11.76]It really doesn't matter how like fast or how good on paper internet is supposed to be.
[96:16.00]There's always pockets that are just terrible and it's impossible to know where those pockets are.
[96:24.08]You can't know that unless you go in and you use it for like a month or two straight.
[96:31.83]It's about stability.
[96:32.71]Yeah, it's not about how fast or good the internet is supposed to be.
[96:35.69]It's how stable it is while it's running.
[96:43.27]And it's... You'll... It's just so hard to... You know, I've said it before and I've heard other people say it, like, well, why didn't you just figure out what the internet was and how good it was before you went there?
[96:56.09]I've actually asked people, actually asked realtors and shit, like, hey, do you know how's the internet?
[97:01.97]And every single question is answered the same way.
[97:05.65]Yeah, high speed.
[97:08.17]You call up these companies and you say, hey, what do you have available here?
[97:12.02]Uh, yeah, we have high speed.
[97:13.58]We have this package for high speed.
[97:14.88]Do you have fiber?
[97:16.70]Yeah.
[97:17.78]Oh, okay.
[97:18.34]Do you though?
[97:19.94]No.
[97:21.82]No, we have this thing.
[97:22.98]It's a thousand down.
[97:24.68]But it's 30 up.
[97:26.35]But it's not fiber.
[97:27.23]No, it's not.
[97:27.73]But it is.
[97:28.07]What the fuck are you talking about?
[97:30.51]You know what I mean?
[97:31.65]It's like impossible to like get straight answers for anything.
[97:41.82]And here's the most, the worst part about this is, if I was to walk down the street and plug in my computer and stream, there might be zero drop frames just because of where it's located on the node on the street.
[97:59.07]You know what I'm saying?
[97:59.93]It's impossible to find that exact location that has zero problems.
[98:13.58]Can I come in and feed off your internet, please?
[98:22.16]Just be a bum streamer.
[98:26.74]No, I just got really unlucky.
[98:29.70]That I had kind of sloppy internet in one place, and then the same kind of sloppy internet in the next one.
[98:40.79]I tried, I tried to figure out what the best place, the best like internet I could get.
[98:46.37]It's just unfortunate.
[98:48.13]And it's funny because I talk like this and I look at like my Twitter feed and I see a ton of people writing, sorry guys, I had to stop the stream because I can't even stream for more than an hour.
[99:00.18]My internet turned off again.
[99:01.96]You know what I mean?
[99:02.38]It's like, it's, this is not, this is not abnormal what I'm saying.
[99:11.16]Which is kind of... annoying.
[99:20.36]It's pretty much every day I'll scroll down my Twitter feed and other streamers that I follow.
[99:24.79]At least one of them will say something like that.
[99:30.67]Nova's having the same problem?
[99:31.99]Yep.
[99:34.39]It just... sometimes... it just happens.
[99:36.82]Sometimes you just get fucked.
[99:39.44]And you... that's it.
[99:45.51]But, I could go, I could talk about this for ages.
[99:47.75]We'll, uh, we'll move on.
[99:48.75]I gotta get out of here anyways because I have to go, obviously, to the airport to pick somebody up.
[99:56.00]Following streamers, laugh out loud.
[100:02.72]Uh, so let's get the credits on the stream and we'll do the final handful of bits here.
[100:05.80]There's like three, four, five more?
[100:10.08]Here are all the subs from today.
[100:11.24]Thank you, everybody.
[100:13.16]Hope you had a good time.
[100:13.92]I did.
[100:18.49]I'm gonna have to, like, go gargle salt water.
[100:20.55]My throat is fucking killing me.
[100:25.87]But thank you to Tingy for that about West Coast Canada.
[100:29.55]I'm glad you have good internet.
[100:30.71]I'm glad you have reliable internet.
[100:34.29]You're the envy of a lot of people, so I'm happy to hear that.
[100:39.54]Zake, thanks for the $2.50.
[100:40.52]Hey man, it was pretty cool to meet you yesterday.
[100:41.94]It was nice chatting with you.
[100:43.28]It got kind of weird though when you stole that kid's ice cream and started screaming obscenities at people.
[100:46.74]Still love your streams though.
[100:48.02]It's alright.
[100:49.95]I'm not a thief.
[100:50.47]I don't steal.
[100:52.17]Smellyboy, thanks for the $2.50, Smellyboy.
[100:55.21]Keck or cringe?
[100:59.65]What is?
[101:01.41]Something about Jackbox?
[101:05.17]I don't know.
[101:06.11]FatboySiant, thanks for the $15, FatboySiant.
[101:10.93]15 bucks.
[101:11.25]If Sekiro gets DLC, will you play it?
[101:13.21]Yes.
[101:14.97]I will do Sekiro DLC on stream if it is a thing.
[101:20.57]Definitely.
[101:22.29]Thank you so much for the $15.
[101:23.07]Yes, I will.
[101:27.34]DarkSoul9669, thanks for the $5.
[101:30.66]I just want you to know that I'm watching the VOD and I got to Tales from the Tomb Raider.
[101:34.20]And I'm in the same condition you were during Fart and Scream compilation.
[101:37.88]Thank you for the streams.
[101:38.94]Take this small sum.
[101:40.51]You got a long way to go.
[101:44.45]That is the tip of the iceberg there.
[101:49.51]Thank you for the $5.
[101:50.15]I'm happy that you had a fun time listening to it.
[101:55.79]In the VOD.
[101:59.30]Also, thank you to iCorka for the 10 bucks.
[102:02.70]They say auto.
[102:03.51]I showed auto.
[102:04.73]Thank you for $10.
[102:06.15]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[102:08.85]Devakitty, thanks for the $2.50.
[102:10.09]Jeremy, you should absolutely play with the transformer thing again.
[102:12.33]I was having difficult deconcentrating because of how good it was.
[102:18.78]It was a fucking bunch of fun.
[102:22.06]I thought Tale of the Tomb Raider was a real game.
[102:24.02]That's why I was... I thought it was an E3 presentation for Tale of the Tomb Raider.
[102:28.60]I was gonna go get the E3 presentation and play it out.
[102:33.80]Tale of the Tomb Raider.
[102:41.08]But, thank you, Devakitty.
[102:44.10]Glad you had fun.
[102:45.19]FreudianWeapon, thanks for the 250.
[102:46.61]All the giant bats, you say?
[102:48.31]All of them.
[102:52.48]Take of the Tomb Raider, right?
[102:54.46]The Jack, 473, thanks for the five dollars, The Jack.
[102:59.00]They say, uh, Zapman emote when?
[103:04.09]Zapman.
[103:06.69]I think Zapman shouldn't be an emote, because Zapman's pissed.
[103:11.39]Because he's not an emote.
[103:14.11]You know what I mean?
[103:23.05]But, thank you.
[103:25.20]I appreciate it.
[103:28.54]AWSM Stevie.
[103:31.39]Awesome Stevie.
[103:35.13]Thank you for the $50 of 10 minutes ago or so.
[103:37.94]I just barely was missing it while we were talking about internet bullshit, but... Thank you, Awesome Stevie, for the $50.
[103:45.42]They say someone hacked my Twitch and PayPal accounts and bought $140 worth of bits out of my money for some fucking reason.
[103:53.28]I got the money refunded.
[103:56.40]But I still have the bits, and I've been giving them out.
[103:58.35]But you get the biggest donation because you're my favorite streamer.
[104:03.31]Uh, they might, you might get that pulled back too.
[104:10.93]You know, when they, they might, it might be processing still.
[104:16.46]But, uh, I thank you.
[104:18.92]I'm honored to be your favorite streamer.
[104:20.68]Thank you so much.
[104:31.12]But I would probably, I would check you, I would make sure that you got, you know, make sure it's processed correctly.
[104:34.96]You might not have.
[104:35.54]You might actually have just spent money.
[104:39.82]Are those sirens coming out of Jerma's mic?
[104:44.48]But nonetheless, thank you.
[104:45.61]I appreciate it.
[104:49.29]And I appreciate all the subs that just went through.
[104:51.31]Thank you, everybody.
[104:55.05]I'm going to take off.
[104:55.69]You'll see me again on Saturday.
[104:57.15]Thank you again for watching.
[105:00.07]See you Saturday.
[105:01.78]MS-DOS night.
[105:02.62]A lot of shitshow streams this last week, huh?
[105:13.21]It's fun, though.
[105:14.09]I'll take it.
[105:17.47]Take care, everybody.
