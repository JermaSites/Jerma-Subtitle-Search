[00:14.03]Super Meat Boy.
[00:15.49]Oh, shit.
[00:23.55]I don't care about your gold PS4.
[00:24.93]Hey, hey.
[00:57.18]Yeah, it is early.
[00:57.78]I suppose that's because this is the bacon and eggs breakfast stream.
[01:02.01]I told you.
[01:03.75]I told you it was going to happen.
[01:06.17]At random times.
[01:09.41]What a great streamer.
[01:11.33]You know, most people, when they stream, they're like, they have like, if you can get used to their schedule, oh, this guy's always live at this particular time.
[01:21.46]He's always going to be, no, no, this is, it's 5 a.m.
[01:24.40]right now.
[01:28.09]What am I doing here right now?
[01:33.51]I should be in bed.
[01:36.74]But no.
[01:38.42]I'm not in bed.
[01:46.64]Is there a reason why we're streaming at 5 in the morning?
[01:48.67]No.
[01:50.05]Actually, there kind of is.
[01:52.05]I'm trying to reset my sleep schedule.
[01:56.33]And...
[01:58.13]What better way to do that than to get my gamer license back?
[02:03.47]Because if you missed the last stream, my gamer license was revoked.
[02:08.71]I had Guppy and like seven familiars in the Vining of Isaac.
[02:14.14]And I lost.
[02:15.58]And my gamer license was revoked.
[02:19.54]So to get it back, we're going to play Super Meat Boy.
[02:25.92]This is an old classic.
[02:26.98]I actually, I played through this game on my channel.
[02:30.04]Like three years ago.
[02:38.60]But, I'm just gonna chill.
[02:41.25]Gonna play it.
[02:43.91]Gonna play Cryptarch too.
[02:46.19]We'll see how far I get with this.
[02:47.51]I might just do like the first or second chapter and then switch to Cryptarch.
[02:52.38]Because that's like a current game.
[02:53.64]But I'm going to warm up with some Meat Boy.
[02:56.08]It's been a while.
[03:04.08]Holy crap, my computer is burning?
[03:05.88]I would get a fire extinguisher and spray it.
[03:17.31]We're going to play a couple games to keep me awake.
[03:21.80]Start with Meat Boy, warm up a little bit, play a little bit of Cryptarch.
[03:28.75]If I complete the forest and into, I'd say, like, the first two or three chapters, then, you know, you get your junior license.
[03:35.07]I'll have my learner's permit.
[03:40.22]But without further ado, we're going to get this off the screen.
[03:42.38]We all know the story.
[03:47.90]I deleted this blast save file I had here, so this is completely clean, fresh slate.
[03:54.18]We're gonna go over A pluses on every single one of these release initial levels.
[04:00.34]Why don't you put your chat in the stream display?
[04:03.02]Well, I have no idea how to do that.
[04:08.52]Just before we get started, I guess we'll address this.
[04:10.52]We're gonna address this, okay?
[04:12.56]I get a lot of people asking me about, um... Well, these first few levels are brainless.
[04:18.34]Um... I get questions all the time.
[04:20.32]About, like, when are you gonna do this?
[04:22.18]When are you gonna do that?
[04:23.32]When are you going to... XYZ?
[04:26.20]Where's this sub button?
[04:27.56]How can I donate to you?
[04:29.00]Why do you not show ads?
[04:30.80]Your stream sucks!
[04:32.27]Where's your overlay?
[04:33.31]Honestly... This, like, first month or so of trying to, like, stream a lot more often...
[04:41.95]is more so a trial run for me to see how, like, settings work than anything else.
[04:49.59]You know, like, could I do all that stuff?
[04:52.77]But no, I want to make sure, like, I can actually stream with, like, a constant bitrate.
[04:59.29]We're actually going to do that again.
[05:05.42]But, like, stuff like facecam will never, like, will never ever be on this channel.
[05:17.47]Your urine samples came back positive for LSD, cocaine, and PCP, but there were no performance-enhancing drugs.
[05:24.27]Well, that's good to know.
[05:26.90]Oh, shit.
[05:32.06]I forgot to say, this is supposed to be a non-death playthrough.
[05:35.78]I wouldn't die one time.
[05:36.82]Alright, well, how do you... This one's just a big, yeah, it's a...
[05:44.96]I've already died too many times here, I think.
[05:47.22]We'll find out.
[05:53.10]Alright, give me the band-aids.
[05:54.70]I totally forgot about the band-aids in this game.
[05:57.82]Oh, shit.
[05:58.54]That was weird.
[06:01.12]I can't fuck this up.
[06:02.50]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[06:05.26]Slow it down.
[06:05.82]I'm trying to get my gamer license back, not throw it in the trash.
[06:21.30]Oops.
[06:25.18]Don't you... did you get commander video for this one?
[06:27.74]I actually don't remember.
[06:36.35]Oh, shit.
[06:37.21]I didn't even know.
[06:37.67]I forgot about the ones at the top.
[06:41.59]Okay, I gotta be careful with this.
[06:51.84]Okay.
[06:57.64]Sky pup?
[06:59.32]There's all kinds of secrets that I forget in this game, but I did that one.
[07:03.20]I think there's something else you have to do in there.
[07:07.08]Was the Wonder Book video the video that cost your entire bank account?
[07:09.96]No.
[07:11.56]Dude, a Wonder Book... A Wonder Book is like $8 for the Wonder Book and the game.
[07:19.91]It's not that expensive.
[07:23.57]That stuff is so old.
[07:24.57]Wonder Books is, like... I really wish we'd see more of that shit, though.
[07:31.85]It's so cool.
[07:32.99]Whoa, whoa, didn't get an A+.
[07:36.36]Excuse me.
[07:37.38]I also didn't get this.
[07:39.36]Fuck.
[07:48.13]No, we're not getting the A+, here.
[07:49.37]We're getting the Band-Aid.
[08:02.50]Now we'll get the A+.
[08:06.34]It's magic for crying out loud.
[08:14.55]What the fuck?
[08:17.07]Was it five seconds?
[08:20.09]What's the quick restart button?
[08:21.83]I know it exists.
[08:22.86]Is it select?
[08:25.58]I'll have to figure that out.
[08:31.76]Another thing I gotta get used to is the Xbox One controller.
[08:38.12]Shit!
[08:40.62]The Xbox One controller is kind of odd because, we'll go over this too, every single one of the, because I don't use the analog, all the D-pads are individual buttons.
[08:52.61]So it's kind of odd, you know, when you scroll your thumb across the bottom of an Xbox One controller, it's like,
[09:00.89]It just kind of feels awkward.
[09:02.25]It feels like I'm pushing my hand over popcorn kernels.
[09:05.56]I'll get used to it, though.
[09:10.46]No, that's not gonna... No.
[09:12.12]Bye again.
[09:18.75]Here we go.
[09:19.55]Am I a PlayStation fan?
[09:22.95]I'm an all-game fan.
[09:24.57]I like all games.
[09:28.35]Doesn't matter what it is.
[09:32.69]All the D-pads.
[09:35.89]All the D-pads.
[09:40.87]Let me get the Band-Aid on this as well.
[09:43.21]Because you gotta get the Band-Aids.
[09:51.60]Oh, shit.
[09:52.42]I blew it.
[09:55.72]But if they made, like, a Wonder Book for the PS4, and it's not because just for, like, oh, yeah, I can't wait to make, like, a video on it.
[10:02.50]That, like, is actually a very cool concept.
[10:05.86]Shit.
[10:08.66]They made four games for that thing.
[10:11.14]There was an unannounced, like... Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[10:14.28]Let me get this band-aid and we'll talk.
[10:20.16]Fuck you.
[10:27.20]Oh my god.
[10:27.72]Alright, I gotta stop going on that one.
[10:29.38]That's the biggest mistake.
[10:33.21]Oh, I did it anyway.
[10:33.87]Alright, fuck it.
[10:34.31]We're not even getting the bandit.
[10:36.21]I'll get it later.
[10:46.90]No, we gotta do it again.
[10:48.00]That was really sloppy.
[10:48.82]I could make that cleaner.
[10:52.50]This is also really sloppy, but, you know, still got it.
[11:01.13]The thing is, I actually like the feel of the Xbox One controller, where the buttons are placed and where the analogs are placed.
[11:08.01]I could really do without how loud this fucking thing is.
[11:11.31]Really, like, every single one of these buttons, it's crazy.
[11:13.45]Like, the bumpers, I'm gonna hit a series of buttons on this controller, and you'll hear, ready?
[11:24.64]Every, like, half the buttons on this thing make a really loud, annoying noise.
[11:30.15]Especially the bumpers.
[11:32.67]Those are so loud.
[11:33.79]Oh, shit.
[11:43.18]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[11:44.52]I'm just gonna skip the band-aids for now.
[11:53.56]We're going for A+.
[12:13.06]I want to go in the Warp Zone.
[12:21.88]Warp Zone!
[12:24.72]Oh, the Steam, that's right, the Steam controller did release, or kind of.
[12:27.96]Isn't it like, can you use it or something?
[12:29.14]Is it beta or something like that?
[12:32.40]Oh, I sip on coffee.
[12:33.52]This is the Commander video level, right?
[12:36.45]I believe it is.
[12:37.17]It is.
[12:40.42]Oh, right.
[12:41.08]Okay.
[12:41.64]You can, like, use it when you... Okay.
[12:44.83]I got it.
[12:48.35]Commander Radio actually I think is my favorite character in this game, if I remember.
[13:02.35]I must have watched the Super Meat Boy playthrough 15 times.
[13:05.89]Well, now you get to see one live.
[13:07.39]I don't know if this is going to be a playthrough or not.
[13:10.63]I'm just kind of playing, just to keep myself awake and warm up my video game skills.
[13:24.37]Will I officiate your bar mitzvah?
[13:28.04]Uh... I...
[13:30.67]I don't think I have the qualifications to do that.
[13:32.89]You know what I mean?
[13:40.61]I don't have... That's an easy Band-Aid.
[13:42.17]I'll get it.
[13:46.37]I want to stick to the walls here.
[13:53.36]I'm rushing it a little too much.
[13:57.64]How many of these sound effects are used in Isaac?
[14:00.06]Yeah, I'd be surprised.
[14:01.12]I mean, it is the same team, right?
[14:05.28]That was still an A+.
[14:07.85]Wow.
[14:15.81]How many times have I completed this game?
[14:20.22]Maybe like three.
[14:22.70]Maybe a little bit less than that.
[14:24.72]Maybe a little bit less than that?
[14:28.49]What does that mean?
[14:30.53]I completed it maybe two or three times.
[14:32.46]Or maybe a little bit less.
[14:33.52]What, like two and a half?
[14:35.32]You know what?
[14:36.22]Yeah, that is true.
[14:37.70]That's true.
[14:39.66]I've completed this game maybe two and a half times.
[14:43.76]One of those playthroughs in particular, not the one that I did on my channel, but just in particular, I was really into it.
[14:51.39]Super duper ultra into this game.
[14:53.51]Is there a band-aid here?
[14:54.15]I don't remember.
[14:56.83]That was a long time ago, though.
[15:00.11]No, I'm not in here.
[15:05.23]When did this game come out?
[15:06.97]Whenever the launch of Super Meat Boy was, it was my favorite game for that year that it was out.
[15:12.82]2009? 2010?
[15:18.40]Am I going to go for all A pluses in the playthrough?
[15:20.88]Um... I could try.
[15:23.20]It's going to be fucking hard, though.
[15:25.10]What am I doing?
[15:26.66]Let me just do this.
[15:38.38]I want to get that band-aid, because it's really not that hard.
[15:40.50]It's all about just sitting here.
[15:41.52]I could just time it like this.
[15:42.48]I don't have to go fast anymore.
[15:47.02]And then I'm gonna try to hook on this wall.
[15:50.28]And... Oh, fuck.
[15:54.89]Fuck.
[15:56.89]Can't get caught up in the Band-Aids.
[15:58.01]This is an A-plus run.
[16:00.07]Nothing more, nothing less.
[16:06.44]And then I had my chance right there.
[16:13.16]Germany's gaming license never existed.
[16:18.03]Should do it as Tofu Boy.
[16:22.49]Are any levels even completable with Tofu Boy?
[16:25.98]I thought that like the game was uncompletable if you played with him.
[16:28.66]Because he can only jump like five feet in the air or something.
[16:52.67]Whoa!
[16:53.57]My eyes just deceived me right there.
[16:54.97]That was weird.
[16:56.95]For some reason I thought I was much lower than I was.
[16:58.83]A+.
[17:08.24]Hooray.
[17:20.24]Burger Boy should be playable in this game.
[17:22.24]I agree.
[17:22.52]Alright, that's... These aren't that hard to A+.
[17:32.99]Am I streaming at 5am?
[17:34.19]I'm just... I don't know.
[17:35.79]For fun.
[17:37.09]For fun's sake.
[17:45.17]Because why not, right?
[17:50.33]Watch out for the squirrels.
[17:58.96]Give me that A+.
[18:02.64]Because you've lost control of your life.
[18:07.76]Yeah, I guess.
[18:14.00]Hey, we won.
[18:16.26]No Dark World, only three bandages.
[18:18.16]Where are the other two warps?
[18:20.64]I don't remember at all where the other two warps are.
[18:25.00]Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding.
[18:40.00]I don't want to know. I don't want to know about your gold PS4, I don't care.
[18:46.00]Here we go, okay. The hospital!
[18:56.03]Have I heard about the Invasion TF2 update?
[18:57.91]Yeah, I played it, like, yesterday.
[19:01.47]It's pretty good.
[19:05.79]It was pretty fun.
[19:06.51]I should probably use, I should use Commander Video for more of this.
[19:13.81]Oh, come on now.
[19:14.79]This is not gonna be an A+.
[19:15.89]I'm just gonna walk into the wall, because it's not an A+.
[19:18.39]Ah, that keeps on fucking me up.
[19:35.15]Whoa, I got stuck there.
[19:36.77]I don't even have to do that, I can just keep going the whole way.
[19:52.32]No, I got too scared.
[19:54.70]Still an A+.
[19:57.84]CommanderVidia is useless.
[19:58.88]Yeah, but he's fun to play.
[19:59.90]I like being able to float around, it's fun.
[20:06.45]Who doesn't, like, float around as Commander Video?
[20:07.89]Do I have anything planned for Halloween?
[20:14.75]I have a video I wanna make for Halloween, but I don't even think it's gonna be possible.
[20:19.56]Like, I really don't think it's a possible video to make.
[20:21.98]I so badly wanna do it, though.
[20:26.93]Could be so much fun.
[20:38.28]Try marking the ninja.
[20:39.24]I actually... Somebody told me that that game is really good.
[20:42.12]I don't remember.
[20:43.80]I forget who it was.
[20:49.84]Oh, no, no.
[20:50.29]I screwed that up.
[20:50.89]I'm going for speed here.
[20:55.73]Well, I screwed it up again, but it's okay.
[20:59.23]No, not anymore.
[20:59.87]There we go.
[21:11.30]How often do my 30 year old eyes deceive me?
[21:13.28]All the time.
[21:20.86]More than you would think.
[21:21.62]Give me the bandaid.
[21:34.43]Give me the bandaid!
[21:39.05]Give me this thing stop it.
[21:40.99]Thank you.
[21:43.87]Oh the love of all fuck the band-aids I don't think I had enough The best one to book game
[22:03.94]I don't know.
[22:05.14]That's a good question.
[22:06.96]They're all fun.
[22:08.38]They're all interesting.
[22:09.46]Nothing over here.
[22:21.47]I screwed it up again.
[22:23.85]Just screwing shit up, you know.
[22:25.41]You know how we do around here.
[22:32.79]I like remember just be able to drop down, right?
[22:39.17]Yeah.
[22:50.93]Punch game?
[22:53.14]There's one more Wonder Book to play.
[22:56.30]I have no idea how it is.
[22:58.43]I feel like it's not gonna be that funny, but I've said that before, and some of those times I've said that end up being, like, some of my favorite things I've ever recorded.
[23:09.09]Like, that GTA 5, like, grab the auto 5, all, like, the mobile rip-offs, I really did, I, like, I didn't know if, like, I was gonna want to make that.
[23:17.59]Like, I sat there for a second, I'm like, dude, is this funny?
[23:20.79]Is this, like, what am I, what I'm doing right now, is this worth me doing?
[23:28.08]I downloaded, like, 30 of those games, and I'm just sitting there thinking, was this the right call?
[23:33.20]Should I have fucking done this?
[23:36.12]It turns out, that was one of my favorite things I've recorded in the last, like, probably at least 6 to 12 months.
[23:48.39]Jerma, lend me your infinite wisdom and guide me on how to pick up the ladies.
[23:52.55]I'm not sure you know this dude, but I am single.
[23:58.31]I'm currently single right now, man.
[23:59.67]I don't know if I can give you the best advice on that.
[24:01.69]Fuck the band-aids.
[24:09.35]What am I doing?
[24:14.02]Get in there!
[24:14.50]Get in there!
[24:14.88]Hopefully they didn't ruin it.
[24:19.76]How many videos get thrown under the rug only seen by, like, me and Star?
[24:24.74]More than you would probably imagine.
[24:27.72]Well, let's put it this way.
[24:29.12]There are a lot of ideas.
[24:33.01]Maybe not so much like the videos get made.
[24:36.45]But there's a lot of ideas that I would say get half made and then swept under the rug.
[24:41.61]I've made entire videos.
[24:42.85]I actually have an entire video that I made that I have never uploaded.
[24:50.13]It's just sitting there rendered, ready for me to upload.
[24:53.84]And I'll never release it because I don't like it.
[25:04.43]Ooh, that was quick.
[25:16.80]I don't know.
[25:17.18]I mean, you guys probably noticed this recently.
[25:22.02]The videos have... The uploads have slowed down.
[25:27.36]And that's mainly because I want to, like, I've already talked about this, I don't even need to talk about it again.
[25:34.03]I'm turning into a broken record about this.
[25:38.91]Long story short, I want to just make the videos that I like to make.
[25:44.46]Rather than, you know, oh I gotta make a video every day, I have to make a video, I have to make like four videos a week.
[25:52.44]I'm just, I'm back to where I was a few years ago.
[25:54.92]Where I just was like, you know what, I like making these videos.
[25:57.60]I'm gonna make a video.
[25:58.54]I like making videos.
[26:10.68]Mmm, shit.
[26:15.52]There's no time limit on these ones.
[26:16.80]There's no, there's no gold to get.
[26:18.41]There's no A-plus to get here.
[26:24.26]Just want to stay alive here.
[26:27.66]Whoa!
[26:30.00]He came out of nowhere.
[26:36.32]Ooh!
[26:36.78]Okay, hold on.
[26:37.46]Hold on a second here.
[26:38.14]Don't screw this one up.
[26:39.04]We got one life left.
[26:51.27]Fuck!
[26:52.11]Shit!
[26:52.63]Fuck!
[26:53.19]Dick!
[26:54.32]Every swear you can imagine, we gotta go back.
[27:01.69]Shit.
[27:02.73]I had that too, I just overreacted.
[27:08.07]That was like a, just a true testament to why you should never overreact in this game.
[27:19.49]You know, you probably should just wait here.
[27:22.78]I'm trying to remember all, like, the strats.
[27:24.88]Wow, I did it again.
[27:25.70]Alright, stop talking.
[27:28.40]Quiet that mouth of yours.
[27:30.44]And just beat this one.
[27:31.70]So we can get out of here.
[27:32.60]Alright, we're skipping this warp zone for now.
[27:43.35]We're gonna come back to it.
[27:47.93]I almost salvaged that.
[27:51.07]Whoa, what?
[27:52.11]Oh, right, I went in the warp zone.
[27:53.45]Oh, that stuck.
[28:22.09]Yeah, I got canned from the DMV.
[28:27.23]I would have loved to have grabbed that when I had the chance to get it.
[28:38.00]Ooh, you fucker!
[28:39.38]Shit.
[28:44.24]That wasn't cool.
[28:53.02]Play it safe.
[28:53.68]Just get the Band-Aid.
[28:55.92]I got an A+.
[29:03.28]I wonder who made all the squishy sound effects for this game.
[29:05.98]Yeah, you know, that's a question that's on my mind sometimes.
[29:10.21]They call them foley artists, right?
[29:13.21]Guys who just pretty much make weird sounds and...
[29:16.66]hit meat with baseball bats and squish up toilet paper with their mouths to make sounds.
[29:21.72]That wasn't an A+.
[29:23.14]Excuse me.
[29:32.65]Ah, I got locked.
[29:33.49]My thumb got locked in there.
[29:54.47]No, just... I'm gonna die.
[29:56.00]I didn't get over that quick enough.
[30:05.66]Here we go!
[30:06.56]Open up, please.
[30:14.65]Whoa!
[30:15.19]16 seconds is A+.
[30:17.31]Means I don't know.
[30:20.57]I gotta go way faster than that.
[30:24.51]No.
[30:35.43]He's got stuff.
[30:40.95]13, 14, 15... There it is.
[30:50.60]That's why I'm single, me and Star.
[30:53.45]I don't know about that.
[30:54.55]Whoa!
[31:01.30]Dah!
[31:02.72]I actually just forgot what this level did.
[31:05.92]You just go right to the right.
[31:12.45]Heya!
[31:13.21]How are ya?
[31:35.81]Oh, I missed that one.
[31:41.51]Oh, I messed up that one big time too.
[31:43.77]Fuck.
[31:49.57]Fuck.
[32:07.81]No, I messed up the timing already.
[32:09.91]Just walk into the dude.
[32:11.11]You gotta go right off the bat.
[32:12.45]You gotta go one, two, three.
[32:14.13]Boom.
[32:15.25]Boom.
[32:15.59]No, I'm okay.
[32:16.55]I'm alright.
[32:18.63]No, no, no.
[32:19.55]I'm rocking the shit again.
[32:20.71]Oh, fuck.
[32:27.26]I'm gonna fucking step on a rake.
[32:30.04]I'm gonna set up a rake in my backyard just so I can step on it like fucking Sideshow Bob in The Simpsons.
[32:42.80]Shoot me up!
[32:44.14]Oh no!
[32:45.36]Oh, I didn't get... No way, I got A-plus now.
[32:49.04]That's really, really annoying.
[32:51.60]What the hell was that?
[32:52.90]How would I have just gotten an A-plus for that?
[32:54.80]That was a C-plus at best.
[32:56.56]That was like a C-minus.
[33:04.51]How high was I when I made the TF2 sound mod?
[33:06.97]I didn't make the TF2 sound mod.
[33:08.71]That was somebody else.
[33:18.32]Alright, let's try this again.
[33:34.09]I was just looking at the chat.
[33:36.42]Whoops.
[33:38.72]This one has a specific pattern that I'm just not going to even care about.
[33:42.64]I'm just going to try to do it on pure skill.
[34:03.99]Wait, what is it?
[34:05.45]What does somebody say?
[34:07.03]Not YouTube because if it is you must have made like two dollars this three months with the rate of uploads and the content of it talking about Star not Jerma.
[34:16.43]I mean...
[34:20.43]You don't have to do something for money.
[34:21.80]You know what I mean?
[34:26.74]Like, yeah, you can get paid for something, but not do it for money.
[34:32.83]Does that make any sense?
[34:34.31]What I just said?
[34:43.07]Like, just because Star or I get paid from our videos doesn't necessarily mean we, like, do it to make money.
[34:53.24]There we go.
[35:02.06]What is the boss of Chapter 2?
[35:03.37]I don't even remember.
[35:04.01]Oh, it's this guy.
[35:09.43]It's Chad.
[35:10.09]There he is.
[35:11.11]Hey, Chad.
[35:14.13]Oh shit, whoops.
[35:20.62]Some of these bosses I do forget the patterns of, so it's going to take me a couple of... Yep, there it is.
[35:25.58]It's going to take me quite a few times probably here.
[35:29.32]Shit.
[35:36.92]Oh, I got locked out of that one.
[35:42.72]Bleh.
[35:50.85]Damn it.
[35:51.60]Going too fast.
[35:56.44]Can you... You know, there are no A pluses on boss.
[35:58.92]What am I doing?
[36:02.76]I already blew it.
[36:06.87]Going for like A pluses and they don't even exist.
[36:14.13]Oh dear.
[36:15.33]Okay.
[36:16.66]Is this going to be the first small wall that I hit?
[36:39.74]Can I get up to the other side without having to do all that?
[36:44.12]I don't think I can.
[36:47.96]Ah, shit.
[36:48.64]I blew it already.
[36:49.86]Damn.
[36:52.64]For as fast as I just did the first one, this is taking me a little longer.
[37:01.15]Just gotta make it... I do that a lot in this game.
[37:04.25]I will say.
[37:18.31]There we go.
[37:18.67]I mean, I'm used to talking about, like, needing a new game.
[37:29.63]I do too.
[37:34.76]I think a lot of people do, right?
[37:35.84]Like, you go through phases.
[37:41.11]Sometimes you go through phases where you are having a ton of fun playing one particular game.
[37:47.89]And it's all you really care about.
[37:49.05]It's the only thing you want to do.
[37:49.95]It's the only thing you want to play.
[37:52.17]And then you're just kind of like you need something else.
[37:55.69]You know what I mean?
[37:59.31]There's no reason to rush into trying to find something that you are interested in.
[38:02.65]Yeah, I skipped that guy.
[38:06.84]I don't want to say I lied.
[38:07.88]Poor Chad.
[38:10.39]Alright, this is where the A-pluses might start stopping.
[38:17.40]I can only guarantee A-pluses on the first, like, two worlds, really.
[38:21.80]Maybe three.
[38:22.36]Oh, shit.
[38:35.28]Oh, shawty.
[38:40.60]This one is... I can do this one.
[38:46.52]Shit.
[38:54.92]Give me that key.
[38:57.04]I need a key.
[39:00.00]Yeah, this is the chapter where people get really shouted.
[39:07.59]I wonder how many people, like, how many people have streamed this game and gotten really shoddy in this part.
[39:14.33]Oh, I can already feel my blood boiling getting a little shoddy.
[39:24.61]No, just get me.
[39:35.96]Oh, I thought that was going the other way.
[39:39.43]You know, something I'm noticing... What's with the snake thing?
[39:44.75]Because I've seen it all over Twitch lately.
[39:46.93]People are doing snake noises and shit.
[39:49.62]What is the snakes?
[39:51.16]Does somebody keep pulling me up to speed here with the internet stuff?
[40:04.55]Yeah, see, that guy right there was just like, hiss.
[40:08.43]Is like, uh, snakes like invading twitch.tv?
[40:17.83]Oh, it's like a, it's like a guy, it's a guy... Twitch has been invaded by fucking snakes.
[40:31.37]Oh jeez, what have I done?
[40:36.88]Yeah, I just don't know where things originate sometimes.
[40:52.37]Now this one's not an A+.
[40:55.01]I can tell you that right now.
[40:57.85]Okay, it is.
[41:09.34]Shouldn't have mentioned it.
[41:11.09]Well, I don't care.
[41:14.71]Stuff like that doesn't really bother me.
[41:18.35]If you want to be like a fucking snake man on Twitch or whatever, you do you.
[41:22.33]Did I get an A plus there?
[41:28.80]No, I didn't.
[41:29.60]I did not.
[41:30.70]I did not.
[41:35.70]We gotta go fix that.
[42:02.77]Warp zone.
[42:06.37]Oh, fuck.
[42:14.77]And I gotta go all the way down on this one.
[42:16.89]Like... That.
[42:19.95]No, not even like that.
[42:23.60]Alright, what the hell am I doing wrong here?
[42:30.24]Apparently that...
[42:37.29]I don't know why I thought that this level went down.
[42:38.99]I don't know why I'm trying to jump either.
[42:43.13]This is the part where the streamers get all salty.
[42:45.39]I've seen it before.
[42:55.34]This jumping off that doesn't do anything, does it?
[42:57.74]Maybe it does.
[43:04.32]The mechanics of some of this shit, I don't even remember.
[43:18.38]There we go.
[43:20.52]Oh, fuck.
[43:27.63]Yeah, this one's hurting my head.
[43:30.77]You have to go all the way down with it.
[43:33.97]But... Oh, hey, no more A-pluses, guys.
[43:37.76]That's the end of the A-plus run.
[43:42.92]No, I get it now.
[43:43.70]I get it.
[43:48.02]I'm just not hitting it at the right spot.
[43:49.42]I gotta go, like, a little bit further down on it, like... here.
[43:52.82]Nope.
[43:55.49]Oh, wait a minute.
[43:56.15]Okay, there we go.
[43:57.01]You just have to touch the bottom.
[44:00.95]That's really all there is to it.
[44:05.23]I'm just getting, like, I'm just getting a little bit salty here, guys.
[44:11.56]That, the thing that just hit me right there?
[44:13.44]A little bit of fucking sodium potassium chloride.
[44:23.52]My first stream.
[44:24.64]What did I play on my first stream?
[44:34.77]Oh, fucking shut up.
[44:43.59]No, just kill me.
[44:50.40]That first one was really good.
[44:51.76]I kind of just blew it.
[44:52.70]Could have had it in the first one.
[44:54.55]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[45:04.71]What did I do that first time?
[45:06.05]What the hell did I... How did... What did I change that first time?
[45:08.29]God, get in there with a Duke Shulker.
[45:22.94]What did I do?
[45:23.38]Alright, let me look.
[45:24.12]I was painting into that.
[45:24.90]It was Binding of Isaac, was it?
[45:26.84]It could have been.
[45:28.38]I could see that.
[45:35.34]Oh, come on.
[45:36.20]Hit the wall.
[45:38.44]We call that dog shit, guys.
[45:40.92]Hit the wall, you dog shit!
[45:49.27]What, like, no vocabulary must have...
[45:53.35]Hit the wall, you dogshit!
[45:58.05]That's a person that doesn't have a whole lot of weathered vocabulary.
[46:04.65]No, I do.
[46:05.07]I'm a linguist.
[46:08.75]I know my dictionary words.
[46:21.08]I hate these things.
[46:23.55]You wanna know, like, okay, so everybody has, like, the bane of their existence in Meat Boy.
[46:27.93]Mine are these stupid rockets.
[46:29.83]I fucking hate these rockets.
[46:33.55]Really messing with my A-plus run.
[46:35.40]Really making me a little bit, what's that word?
[46:37.04]I forget it.
[46:37.82]You know, I'm not a linguist.
[46:39.56]What's that word?
[46:42.42]Like, peppery?
[46:43.60]A little too peppery?
[46:50.70]A little too, you know, garlic powder?
[46:53.13]He's getting real garlic powdery.
[46:59.80]What am I doing?
[47:00.46]Fuck you!
[47:04.36]God.
[47:10.86]Get down there, please.
[47:13.57]We don't got all day, we're going... Okay.
[47:16.09]Okay.
[47:29.08]What?
[47:31.10]10?
[47:31.64]What was that?
[47:36.00]Maybe I should... I think I should just fall right down, right?
[47:38.01]Let's see.
[47:38.37]Yeah, I'm wasting too much time there.
[47:39.75]I gotta go straight down.
[47:40.93]Yeah, there's... Vanilla extract.
[47:50.28]Oh, you dummy.
[47:55.76]Super Meat Boy can induce rage in anyone.
[47:57.88]Especially if you're trying to do all 100% A+.
[47:59.02]There we go.
[48:00.08]There it is.
[48:15.98]Oh, that didn't register.
[48:16.96]Control is broken.
[48:17.68]Control is fucking broken.
[48:32.35]Did you see that streamer rage on Super Meat Boy?
[48:37.17]It was so crazy.
[48:37.83]He threw his controller into the ground and it exploded.
[48:41.29]Oh my god, it's gonna be everywhere.
[48:43.28]Did you see that streamer that was really mad and enraged?
[49:03.74]This one, almost a guaranteed A+.
[49:05.54]As long as you just, right when that thing ends, you hit it.
[49:14.82]Burger Boy Sunny Day is a video that will never be released.
[49:20.22]Ever.
[49:26.17]What the fuck happened there?
[49:28.45]That was odd.
[49:32.97]Can't you just bypass that?
[49:36.35]No, I guess you have to wait.
[49:37.65]I hate waiters.
[49:40.24]They come over, they try to take your order and shit, and you're like, excuse me, I'm here on a lunch date.
[49:46.84]Come back later.
[49:48.52]But, uh, please bring more bread.
[49:51.10]Idiot.
[49:53.34]And he gives you that waiter look, you know, the like.
[49:56.34]Hmm.
[49:58.92]I don't even refill your Coke.
[50:01.73]I don't even refill your Pepsi and shit.
[50:05.19]Where are you?
[50:09.85]I'm doing this one wrong for the A+.
[50:12.26]I gotta go on the other side, I think.
[50:13.74]Like over here.
[50:17.26]Fart in my fucking mouth.
[50:40.19]No, I hate that.
[50:41.59]I hate that.
[50:42.77]Why must it do that sometimes to me?
[50:45.97]Oops.
[50:50.91]God, did you guys see that whiny, whiny streamer?
[50:53.81]I hate that whiny streamer that plays Super Meat Boy.
[50:57.24]What a whiner.
[51:03.45]It's gonna be on the front page of r slash whiners.
[51:21.56]Let me through.
[51:24.56]No, it did it again, whiner.
[51:32.70]Rip it.
[51:33.52]Bark, boy.
[51:34.20]We got frogs taking over now?
[51:37.34]Now, guys, I don't want to be, uh, you know, weirdo about this, but frogs.
[51:43.94]I mean, who wanted to take over?
[51:47.27]Frogs wanted to take over Twitch?
[51:50.07]I think I'd be okay with frogs.
[51:52.67]I mean, who really, who wouldn't be okay with a frog taking over Twitch?
[52:01.15]Especially if they were giant bullfrogs.
[52:06.93]Ah, shit.
[52:11.18]Oh, you dumba.
[52:13.12]You dumba.
[52:14.84]I'm gonna be making up random insults for myself this whole time, so I apologize about that.
[52:31.22]Unclog the frog?
[52:33.00]Permit the Kermit?
[52:35.14]I've never heard of these before.
[52:40.01]Hey guys, look what we're at.
[52:42.25]My least favorite thing in this whole game.
[52:45.79]R slash slash R slash wine slash whiner.
[52:55.82]Ooh, I blew it.
[52:58.26]I blew it.
[53:01.16]Look at how much I just blew that.
[53:04.25]You blew it, you know?
[53:25.93]This is where my A plus streak ends.
[53:28.26]Nah, you know, I thought about it.
[53:29.56]I thought it was gonna end.
[53:30.60]It's going to end.
[53:31.96]Let's just put it that way.
[53:33.76]I don't know when, but it will.
[53:38.32]Maybe around, like, world four or something.
[53:50.01]No shit.
[53:51.17]What?
[53:51.73]Oh, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.
[53:54.01]Gah, gah, gah.
[54:00.12]You know, I don't want to get myself angry here and say this is snow level.
[54:04.84]You know, I don't want to be one of those angry streamers that get on the front page.
[54:10.21]Alright, I like that way too much.
[54:13.45]I need to, like, stop doing that.
[54:28.30]Hey, look!
[54:28.84]All 8 fossils did it!
[54:29.78]Hooray!
[54:30.25]Let's beat the snowman.
[54:33.35]Skip.
[54:34.73]Oh, this is the race.
[54:37.71]Am I crazy?
[54:38.81]Hold on.
[54:39.51]Am I insane?
[54:40.49]Or did he just go way faster than he's supposed to?
[54:45.40]I'm crazy, right?
[54:50.88]I can't be crazy.
[54:54.39]I thought you were supposed to race this guy.
[54:55.57]He's already done it.
[55:00.50]What?
[55:04.98]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[55:06.36]He's going so fast!
[55:07.16]He's like x2 speed!
[55:13.33]I'm the guy that's supposed to beat him!
[55:22.78]Is he gonna get stuck at the end or something?
[55:28.26]That's not fair.
[55:28.88]Where's my, like, drugs to take to go that fast?
[55:39.31]Damn it, I beat him.
[55:41.51]I'll take it.
[55:41.91]I'll take it.
[55:54.24]On to chapter four, I guess.
[56:03.77]Has anybody ever seen that before?
[56:05.80]Because in like the three or four times that I've played or watched people play that part... I've probably seen that done a lot.
[56:17.42]I've never ever... I'm just gonna pretend like I beat that fair and square.
[56:29.78]We're not going for warp zones.
[56:31.18]We're not going for... We're going for all A+.
[56:34.15]As fast as possible.
[56:35.97]I've got my splits here.
[56:38.64]And I am on world record pace.
[56:47.62]Yeah, right.
[56:48.16]Keep going up there.
[56:52.68]Why do I keep going up there?
[56:59.01]No, no, no, no.
[56:59.65]You've got to go underneath.
[57:06.55]Shit, I need more speed.
[57:09.59]This is where the A pluses stop.
[57:17.98]Just kidding.
[57:22.85]H-E double hockey schticks.
[57:25.81]I love that terminology.
[57:26.69]I hate, fuck, god.
[57:31.95]Bring me my coke refill.
[57:43.59]Impatient.
[57:45.01]But that is how you're supposed to beat that, I think.
[57:47.55]You need to just make that jump.
[58:08.21]Let's go.
[58:11.16]This is a floater.
[58:16.29]Oh, this is one of those floaters, guys.
[58:18.17]Dammit.
[58:20.93]Still got him.
[58:29.27]Did that incorrectly.
[58:30.03]I did it correctly at the beginning.
[58:38.47]But then the fire guy hit me.
[58:41.67]Ow.
[58:59.90]Oh my goodness.
[59:02.04]What am I doing here?
[59:09.13]Oh my god, wait.
[59:10.73]Again, I have to wait for a waiter.
[59:14.87]You know how fast I want to go?
[59:16.01]I don't want to have to wait for this shit.
[59:19.23]Now it's getting in my head.
[59:26.12]Always the damn waiter levels.
[59:32.29]Okay, you know what?
[59:33.51]I just did the thing where I turned my neck sideways to crack my neck because I'm getting mad.
[59:56.16]Look, here's the thing.
[59:57.04]If it's a waiting level, what is happening to my voice?
[60:01.54]Whoa.
[60:07.49]If it's a waiter level, it's gonna be an A+, as long as you get there by the time the platform has to be there.
[60:14.51]That's how those work, so I don't need to rush it.
[60:19.10]Like this one.
[60:20.46]It's gonna stand here.
[60:32.95]Yeah, I gotta get some more bacon and eggs in me.
[60:38.09]Why did I think that that was gonna work?
[60:55.84]Damn it.
[60:56.88]Nah, I slipped.
[60:58.04]Hold on, how many seconds do I need to shave off of that?
[61:05.07]A huge amount.
[61:06.43]An absolutely massive amount of time has to be shaved off.
[61:22.75]That's gotta be right there.
[61:27.98]Can I do that though?
[61:28.76]I wonder if that's even possible.
[61:32.64]Maybe it's not.
[61:36.58]Let me shave, like, three full seconds off.
[61:42.97]Oh, that, yeah, I could easily shave seconds off there.
[61:49.41]Thought you were switching games after World 2.
[61:51.67]I was.
[61:52.31]Until... Here, here's what's gonna happen.
[61:55.22]Once I stop reliably getting A+, within, like, you know, 10 to 20 attempts on a level, that's when we're gonna switch games.
[62:09.72]Oh shit, I fucked that up.
[62:16.96]Shit, I fucked it up again.
[62:17.88]Get the hold on the wall.
[62:19.06]Shit, I fucked it up again.
[62:20.00]Oh shit!
[62:38.15]Oh, that jump!
[62:43.95]Good morning.
[62:46.13]Need more speed.
[62:49.00]You always need more speed in V4.
[62:54.00]I should have just grabbed onto the wall.
[62:56.16]That was a mistake.
[62:59.70]No, I went too fast that time.
[63:01.02]Maybe not fast enough.
[63:12.76]I gotta get up there when I'm doing two jumps.
[63:14.50]That's really important.
[63:15.50]That has to happen.
[63:18.00]Well, that... That was not... That was, like, four jumps.
[63:24.08]Is there a Meat Boy drinking game?
[63:26.28]Probably.
[63:26.76]Ah, that was it, too, and I just was too psycho about it.
[63:33.16]Am I gonna watch the Overwatch beta stream?
[63:34.78]Holy shit, yeah.
[63:37.09]Can't wait for that.
[63:37.79]I just wanna play the game again, man.
[63:41.37]Like, ugh.
[63:43.27]I just want to play Overwatch again.
[63:53.60]That's so easy to get.
[63:54.54]I have to just get it.
[64:04.68]I'll get it.
[64:05.10]Just hold on.
[64:05.60]Everybody chill out.
[64:08.06]Everybody gets chill out, okay?
[64:10.29]Yeah, he missed.
[64:10.87]Oh, yeah, he missed it.
[64:12.80]I better not see any LOLs in that chat.
[64:15.91]If I miss this again, I swear to God, if I see a fucking goddamn LOL.
[64:32.92]Fuck the band-aids.
[64:33.92]Let's go.
[64:44.14]I'm seeing LOLs in the chat.
[64:46.84]Unbelievable.
[64:49.41]Un-be-lievable.
[64:53.25]Oh, I forget how to do this one.
[65:04.20]Pick it up!
[65:04.72]Pick up the... See, if I did that right, I would've been fine.
[65:23.05]Yeah, I didn't even get it.
[65:23.89]I didn't even get it.
[65:24.39]You got it.
[65:25.31]Get it!
[65:28.11]Angry streamer.
[65:28.73]These guys are so angry.
[65:32.89]Somebody get this guy, like, a towel to wipe the sweat off of his forehead.
[65:36.83]Oh, fuck.
[65:59.07]Did it again.
[66:00.19]Hey, hey, look what's in this level, guys.
[66:02.79]What is that?
[66:03.63]What is that platform?
[66:04.67]What is that platform?
[66:05.67]What am I doing?
[66:06.21]I'm waiting?
[66:08.25]And then I get all thrown off and I can't do the next part?
[66:14.15]Waiter.
[66:15.43]Bring me the check.
[66:17.27]I'm going to fucking McDonald's.
[66:20.56]What's this dog food that you're serving us?
[66:33.54]Oh, that's what that did.
[66:35.70]Well, that's what that did.
[66:51.30]I'm gonna get a coffee soon.
[66:52.28]I could, you know, I got a coffee already.
[66:54.96]I'm good, man.
[66:55.90]Appreciate it, though.
[66:58.50]Appreciate the offer.
[67:23.42]Fuck.
[67:26.86]I think I'm doing something a little bit wrong.
[67:30.12]What am I doing wrong though?
[67:32.93]You have to go super fast.
[67:40.61]No, no, I'm taking too much time doing it.
[67:49.30]Getting ready for school.
[67:54.61]Make sure you're not late.
[67:55.53]I don't want you to watch this and be late to go to school.
[68:03.52]No, whoops.
[68:04.32]I just, like, ran over the whole thing.
[68:05.68]Alright, but yeah, this one you gotta do the jump.
[68:10.15]You don't want to land on that thing, if I remember.
[68:12.80]I'm not going fast enough.
[68:32.10]Wendy's Big Mac McDouble Mc... What?
[68:35.16]Wendy's what?
[68:36.60]You don't want a Wendy's Big Mac McDouble Mc... Oh, no!
[68:40.20]Okay, I remember what that is now.
[68:46.42]That was fun.
[68:47.50]That was another fun video.
[68:55.29]Ugh.
[69:00.76]Wendy's Devil McFuckFuck McFuck Devil.
[69:04.70]Yeah, that is something that was stated.
[69:06.97]I wish there was more fun games like that to play with your buddies.
[69:14.63]That was a real good buddy game.
[69:27.19]Ah, fuck, I just forgot everything I was doing.
[69:47.16]Hello.
[69:50.94]Just saying hello randomly.
[69:54.80]No, just kill me.
[69:55.60]I already screwed up.
[69:59.98]You bet you didn't know about that secret strat, did you?
[70:04.83]Bet you guys didn't know about that secret strategy, did you?
[70:07.57]Check this one out.
[70:08.21]See that?
[70:09.15]Won't hit you there.
[70:10.67]That's just secret tips and strategies with me.
[70:22.37]I forget this one.
[70:23.31]Do I have to go back?
[70:30.11]I think I have to run back, don't I?
[70:34.15]Yeah, I do.
[70:35.93]No, I don't.
[70:40.21]Hmm.
[70:42.55]Maybe I do.
[70:44.56]Let me really look at this one.
[70:45.92]You have to be up there, so he has to start up here.
[70:48.42]And then you go down like that.
[70:54.37]Been a while.
[70:58.75]Fuck.
[70:59.73]Guess not.
[71:00.07]Can I just slide back down if I really want to?
[71:18.74]I, like, don't even know how to do this.
[71:25.88]Again, we're at a waiter.
[71:29.46]Back and forward, maybe?
[71:37.16]Huh.
[71:38.46]Well, I, like, blew through the entire game, and now I, like, don't know how to beat this level, even without a- I don't even know how to beat the level.
[71:51.61]Like, how do you even beat this level?
[71:55.20]It's taken me an hour to get through like four and a half chapters in this entire game with A+.
[71:59.10]I don't know how to complete this.
[72:04.52]I know you have to sit up there.
[72:05.46]Do you use one of the bottom ones to block or something?
[72:35.08]Shit.
[72:40.63]Oh, wow.
[73:12.89]To beat this level, walk into the forest and eat the first mushroom you see.
[73:27.08]Fuck you!
[73:45.01]I did not think I was gonna hit a wall where I couldn't complete a level.
[73:48.19]I've beaten this game like fucking 20 times.
[73:58.68]Fuck you, that's what you do.
[73:59.72]You know how many times I've beaten this game?
[74:06.00]20 times.
[74:13.74]That motherfucker keeps hitting me.
[74:17.53]Whoops.
[74:24.07]Jesus.
[74:24.83]Alright, now I fucking figured it out.
[74:27.27]Took me long enough.
[74:30.73]Will you fuck off, left eyeball?
[74:35.10]Just fuck right the fuck off.
[74:38.30]You know what I'm saying?
[74:51.46]Fucking seriously.
[74:52.30]Hey, watch this, ready?
[74:55.18]I'm gonna get through this level in an A plus the rest of this world in fucking less than 10 minutes.
[74:59.84]It's these stupid fucking dumbass levels that have all this fucking shit that spits goo out of their eyes.
[75:05.70]You know what I mean?
[75:09.26]Get me on that fucking front page of our rage streamer.
[75:11.71]I'm gonna get on there.
[75:19.37]This is like the hardest level in the whole game.
[75:34.78]A+.
[75:35.14]Okay, let's continue.
[75:36.77]Let me get an A+, right now.
[75:43.03]Watch me get this A+.
[75:43.93]Watch it right here.
[75:51.36]Watch this A+, guys.
[75:52.41]Here it comes.
[76:02.35]I just actually forgot what that... I didn't even know what that level just did.
[76:12.45]Fucking dumbass saw blades.
[76:21.97]I get this.
[76:22.63]I'm not going to take nearly as many tries.
[76:28.36]What just happened?
[76:32.00]Alright, we'll change in games after this.
[76:33.64]I'm about to flip out.
[76:34.92]You want to see somebody freak out?
[76:37.54]Oh god, here comes a freak out.
[76:38.74]Fucking waiter level.
[76:59.42]At least I'm gonna beat the waiter level on the first try.
[77:02.06]Oh dear, fuck.
[77:05.27]That's what I get for opening my mouth.
[77:46.89]First try.
[77:48.57]Those dodges.
[77:55.17]Oh, okay.
[77:56.23]Let's remember what the level is before we try to do it.
[78:03.76]Okay.
[78:05.78]There's another part to this one too, isn't there?
[78:07.14]If I remember.
[78:09.70]If I remember correctly.
[78:10.74]Uh, well, I...
[78:19.55]I... just getting confused.
[78:21.97]Can't do this one fast.
[78:22.87]What's the timer on this one?
[78:26.68]I bet this one's probably like a minute.
[78:30.16]No, 22 seconds.
[78:31.72]This is not like an 8 second one.
[78:39.90]Just getting stuck on walls.
[78:43.15]You sticky, skinless fuck.
[78:56.23]Shouldn't I be able to jump from that?
[78:57.39]Or I'm just hitting the top of the wall.
[79:07.95]Oh no, there that goes.
[79:16.38]Probably jump underneath those too.
[79:17.88]I'm just not doing it.
[79:18.94]Whoa!
[79:29.73]Nah, I guess you do- nah, you just gotta go.
[79:33.75]Alright, now I know you can jump underneath them now.
[79:36.05]Wasn't doing that before.
[79:36.93]Alright, I'm switching to Cryptarch after this.
[79:54.80]I know this is never gonna end well for me.
[79:58.23]I'm just going to get so mad.
[80:00.65]And I'm going to start breaking things in this room.
[80:03.67]I'm just going to start swinging around in circles.
[80:09.37]No, I'm not doing this one right.
[80:15.96]Wait a minute.
[80:16.90]Am I going too fast?
[80:20.56]I think I'm just going too fast to be able to complete this one.
[80:32.41]Let's see.
[80:37.11]Let's find out.
[80:42.77]Yeah, I think I have to, like, wait longer, don't I?
[80:44.65]Well, I'll just wait till these... I'll go over the top of this, then.
[80:52.56]Yeah.
[80:54.32]Huh.
[80:56.60]Well, shit.
[80:59.24]That's not cool.
[81:05.84]Maybe, what, another cycle?
[81:09.88]Like, one.
[81:10.34]Dude, that would be one cycle there, right?
[81:21.37]No.
[81:22.75]That was not a full cycle.
[81:24.37]That was like a half cycle.
[81:29.87]One.
[81:30.03]Two.
[81:31.51]Nope.
[81:33.97]I gotta wait again.
[81:42.37]One, two, three.
[81:51.50]Fucking have to wait around.
[82:03.71]I feel like that's not correct.
[82:07.73]I think you just have to go faster through this.
[82:11.91]Not this one in particular, but the other one.
[82:14.32]Like, right when I get in here.
[82:18.00]There we go, yeah.
[82:18.58]I had it all wrong.
[82:22.11]You're kidding me right now.
[82:23.31]You have to be kidding me.
[82:25.93]Give me, like, one second of teleport immunity.
[82:29.12]Please.
[82:39.75]Can I please get that like half second of teleport immunity?
[82:52.44]What a pain in the dick.
[82:57.04]That is such a pain in the balls, it really is.
[83:04.75]If only there was like a quarter of a tenth of a second of teleportation immunity.
[83:09.75]That shit wouldn't happen.
[83:10.69]Alright.
[83:21.44]Did it.
[83:25.34]Look at all those meat boys.
[83:32.98]Alright.
[83:34.48]Let's go.
[83:37.60]Don't kill me, please don't kill me, please don't kill me!
[83:42.40]Oh, right, I forgot he does that.
[83:43.94]Yes, he does that.
[83:49.04]This is a pattern I have to re-memorize.
[83:54.69]Visit again on the other side.
[83:55.75]No, that's not long enough.
[84:05.51]Bang!
[84:08.85]And then he goes crazy and hits, like, a couple times.
[84:12.07]Oh, fuck.
[84:12.64]You know, he smashes his face.
[84:23.16]Smash your face down, and then he does, like, one, two, three, four with his fist, right?
[84:26.26]It's like left, left, middle, middle or something.
[84:32.71]Left, right, middle, middle.
[84:36.05]Yeah, left, right, and then he goes in the middle.
[84:38.39]And then he does it again.
[84:46.14]Way too early, but it's okay.
[84:49.02]First Jerma stream?
[84:49.96]Welcome.
[84:50.58]How you doing, man?
[84:54.74]It's an easy pattern.
[84:55.32]You have to jump three times.
[84:56.36]You know, there's a safe spot.
[84:57.18]Yeah, I just have to remember it's been like years.
[84:59.41]Oh my god, I'm too busy looking and talking and not even paying attention.
[85:07.34]The last time I played this game was the last time you watched me play it on my YouTube channel three years ago.
[85:11.78]Do it, go ahead.
[85:21.17]He does it again.
[85:25.87]Which side is he doing with his left?
[85:30.90]Do the right side?
[85:32.18]No, he smashes his face again.
[85:43.43]Fuck!
[85:45.63]It's so easy, but you just have to memorize it.
[85:49.96]Trial and error memorization.
[86:02.36]That was just on such a stupid spot.
[86:13.52]Go ahead.
[86:14.94]And please drop the fire right in the middle where I want to stand.
[86:17.42]That'd be great.
[86:18.54]Oh, there you go.
[86:19.84]Thanks.
[86:20.10]Thanks for doing it.
[86:22.87]You dingus.
[86:30.17]Oh!
[86:31.47]I thought he smashed his face.
[86:32.53]He smashes his face after doing it one time.
[86:39.89]Well, I'm going to change to Cryptarch after this, because this is like... There's two more chapters after this, but, you know.
[86:48.71]I kind of want to switch.
[86:56.06]I seriously was just sitting there, just blanking.
[86:58.34]I was sitting there just, like, zoned out.
[87:05.30]I was thinking about, like, breakfast sausage.
[87:10.01]I honestly was sitting there going, you know what's gonna be really... I'm gonna have to breakfast sausages.
[87:16.26]I don't even need to move.
[87:24.93]Now he smashes his face again.
[87:26.27]Stop paying attention to sausages and pay attention to the game.
[87:31.49]I think this is a safe spot.
[87:39.93]Which hand comes down?
[87:40.69]I forget.
[87:41.47]It's that one.
[87:42.55]Oh my god, he does it two times in a row.
[87:49.05]Fucking memorizing shit.
[87:56.28]Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage.
[87:57.60]Doesn't that sound, like, good right now?
[88:00.72]Other than, like, re-memorizing a boss fight in Meat Boy that you haven't done in three years.
[88:15.70]Go for it.
[88:16.32]I might be in some trouble here.
[88:34.34]Do it again.
[88:39.50]Why am I moving?
[88:40.39]I don't need to move.
[88:45.24]I didn't need to move there.
[88:46.36]I just don't... I just, like, don't care at all about this right now.
[88:54.42]I always hated this boss.
[88:55.92]I hate this boss because it's so slow and you just have to sit here and, like, you just get bored.
[89:03.45]And by the time you... No, what are you doing?
[89:11.59]Like, I'm just... I just, like...
[89:13.82]Why is he a bigger meat boy than me?
[89:15.16]That's not fair.
[89:17.54]I want to be the big one.
[89:24.42]Do it again.
[89:24.90]And then smash your fucking head again.
[89:30.56]And please end me.
[89:32.14]End me.
[89:32.62]Thank you.
[89:38.53]Hooray.
[89:42.65]Gotta use the Force.
[89:46.06]The Rapture.
[89:49.42]Size doesn't matter.
[89:52.90]This is one more.
[89:54.14]Is Rapture the end?
[89:55.93]I don't remember.
[90:02.49]We're just gonna get an A-plus on this first one.
[90:04.35]We're gonna do it with Commander Video.
[90:08.15]That's how I get my gamer license back.
[90:11.41]I have to A-plus one of these levels with Commander Video.
[90:20.17]That's not going to be an A+.
[90:23.06]In fact, I think some of these videos... Some of these videos... Some of these I think are not possible to beat with Commander Video, because he doesn't go fast enough.
[90:33.72]Let's see.
[90:41.00]Why am I forgetting how to do this?
[90:59.41]22 seconds?
[90:59.93]How long is that?
[91:05.77]How slow am I moving with this guy?
[91:07.91]Oh, it was right there.
[91:08.97]That was the issue.
[91:11.51]Get that right the first time and I'll have it.
[91:14.51]Yeah, I'll do that again.
[91:17.87]Commander video!
[91:21.25]I can go... I don't think I've ever unlocked the 70 plus characters.
[91:27.25]That was a little sloppy, but whatever.
[91:34.42]Yeah, I'm going to start over.
[91:35.34]That was sloppy.
[91:40.20]Ooh.
[91:41.80]Whoops-a-daisy.
[91:42.38]Okay.
[91:51.08]I want it to grab and jump, not float!
[92:00.86]Fucking... I'm gonna crush up fucking glass and put it in my cereal.
[92:08.46]Actually, you know, I'd probably... See, that with Meat Boy is like the easiest jump you could ever do.
[92:15.06]You just go right through it.
[92:30.73]Commander video.
[92:34.38]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[92:35.56]Just do three of those.
[92:36.64]I got it.
[92:36.96]Dog!
[92:46.35]Ah!
[93:04.46]Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go right now, gotta go, gotta go.
[93:06.79]I didn't even want to do that.
[93:08.51]Like, name like 10 things you didn't want to do in your life.
[93:12.45]Floating right there as Commander Video is one of them.
[93:17.65]Trying to go too fast.
[93:25.10]Too slow.
[93:30.99]I remember when I played this game the first time.
[93:33.77]Just trying to beat these levels.
[93:34.75]I'm still too slow.
[93:35.79]Why am I still that slow right now?
[93:38.53]Nothing has changed.
[93:39.23]I'm still getting this one.
[93:44.74]Oh, come on.
[93:45.74]Please.
[93:50.55]he didn't want to float that time what the fuck are you doing commander video please and all that is sacred what the fuck are you doing go don't float this time
[94:22.68]I would have had it.
[94:23.62]I thought I was going to miss the time.
[94:24.84]I really did.
[94:26.52]I really, truly did.
[94:30.98]I honestly thought I was going to get it.
[94:33.43]I was definitely going to make the time, though.
[94:35.85]So it'll happen.
[94:36.49]It'll happen right now.
[94:39.99]I had like three extra seconds.
[94:41.45]I thought I only had like one.
[94:42.19]Yay!
[94:42.45]Yay!
[94:52.30]I can't believe you've done this.
[94:53.48]Alright, last- it doesn't even matter what happens here, this is the final thing I'm doing.
[95:01.73]Last time.
[95:06.51]After this one.
[95:07.23]Like, this is the last thing, no matter what happens.
[95:09.15]This is the last life.
[95:23.62]Alright.
[95:25.82]Do I get... I A-plussed every meat boy's level into Rapture, and now I want to play Cryptarch.
[95:33.39]Do I have my learner's permit back?
[95:38.17]Do I get to do the actual driving test in like a week or two?
[95:49.11]You said last one a whole chapter ago.
[95:53.26]What kind of freak is even up at this hour for any purpose other than eating sausage?
[95:56.81]That's a good question.
[95:59.07]That's a really good question.
[96:03.63]Let me change my stream title to CryptArk.
[96:25.27]Let's load up Cryptarch.
[96:35.91]Set up a straw poll.
[96:38.59]For what?
[96:48.57]What are we doing a straw poll for?
[96:51.48]What are we doing?
[96:59.41]He threw away a carry rebirth run.
[97:02.01]I did.
[97:02.33]That's why we have to get our gaming license back.
[97:12.60]Permit to Kermit.
[97:15.02]I got my Kermit learner's permit.
[97:21.70]Let me get Cryptarch open.
[97:36.94]Let's go ahead and open that.
[97:41.91]So I got to the Cryptarch.
[97:43.97]I got to the end of this game.
[97:45.89]And I got a really, really crazy, awful generation.
[97:51.15]And I lost.
[97:52.80]But I'm just chilling.
[97:54.70]I'm just going to do dumb builds.
[97:56.02]I don't even care if I lose or not.
[97:57.52]I might even try the controller to test it out and see how it is.
[98:08.63]The fuck was that?
[98:10.03]What is with these weird animals?
[98:16.48]It's like animals always like outside making like weird noises.
[98:24.24]Hold on a second.
[98:24.96]I need to like see what like turkey or something is outside.
[98:27.28]I'll be right back.
[100:19.01]Okay.
[100:19.69]Yeah, that was weird.
[100:21.05]I heard a bunch of, like, weird animal noises outside.
[100:22.93]I hear those a lot here.
[100:24.07]And then I went and got my dog.
[100:36.62]Let's change it to this.
[100:40.24]Let's play Cryptarch.
[100:43.66]Let's Kappa the shit out of Jerma.
[100:47.76]What?
[100:49.59]What?
[100:53.38]Kappa him?
[100:54.82]Get him.
[100:55.36]Like, let's get him.
[100:56.74]Kappa him.
[100:57.50]I don't get it.
[101:01.92]You're going to Kappa me?
[101:06.10]Why would you do such a thing?
[101:10.56]I'm going to just do the easy stuff.
[101:16.23]Just going to do the easy stuff.
[101:23.98]Kappa.
[101:25.66]Imagine being that guy.
[101:28.48]Your entire... Your face... is a... timeless... internet thing.
[101:40.59]Alright, what do I... You know, I could always go with zip gun.
[101:44.85]No, it's like the first level.
[101:46.31]That's not even necessary.
[101:47.45]I'm just gonna go with the regular machine gun.
[101:49.21]No... No ram spike.
[101:55.15]We'll go with just the standard blaster, I think.
[101:58.47]Oh, Mouse 4 now works, by the way.
[102:01.81]Wait, why is it a black screen?
[102:02.74]What the hell?
[102:07.88]Black screen?
[102:10.72]What?
[102:13.00]What?
[102:16.57]That doesn't make any sense.
[102:17.53]Why would that... Why?
[102:20.33]Why?
[102:21.19]Why?
[102:27.01]I figured it out.
[102:27.63]Hold on.
[102:32.55]We gotta add this.
[102:33.59]I thought I added this already.
[102:37.87]Apparently not.
[102:42.67]Apparently not.
[102:48.19]No, now we're back.
[102:48.85]Hi.
[102:49.25]Now you can see.
[102:57.04]I broke something.
[102:57.64]I always break shit.
[102:59.36]But anyways, Mouse4 wasn't working for me before.
[103:02.04]It is now.
[103:03.18]I can actually use grenades and not have to hit F. Which was a pain in the butt.
[103:10.42]I'm okay with this.
[103:13.94]In fact, I don't even need this many grenades.
[103:18.49]Loadout max 100k.
[103:20.49]No supply pods.
[103:21.49]That sounds easy enough.
[103:24.31]I'll take one of these down too, probably.
[103:29.44]Sounds good to me.
[103:34.72]Alright.
[103:35.56]What are we working with?
[103:39.85]We've got shield here.
[103:41.21]Alarm system there.
[103:43.82]And then core to destroy.
[103:46.04]This is Cryptarch, by the way.
[103:54.27]Bound your shield to mouse 4 and your second weapon.
[103:56.27]That's actually not a bad idea.
[103:57.95]I might try that in a minute.
[103:59.17]We'll see.
[103:59.53]I'm just going to go in this way.
[104:05.91]I'm going to take the alarm system out.
[104:08.39]Get a couple tech upgrades.
[104:09.51]Get a couple keys.
[104:11.91]And destroy this.
[104:14.35]But I cannot... If I want to get the bonuses, I can't take any supply pods.
[104:17.76]That's right.
[104:19.92]I'm going to go around up to the top right.
[104:23.00]And something I didn't know, you can actually put waypoints if you click.
[104:27.17]Did not know that at all last time.
[104:32.31]Let's go.
[104:37.15]Crypt Ark.
[104:44.69]Right in the door here.
[104:47.31]Let's get it.
[104:53.72]Now I can very effectively... That does work!
[105:00.29]Look at that.
[105:00.99]You can actually block the... shit with your shield, can't you?
[105:05.83]You don't trigger the alarm if you do that.
[105:09.87]Something I didn't know before.
[105:11.25]You know, remember the last time I played this, I didn't know what the hell was going on?
[105:14.93]Well, I sort of, sort of do now.
[105:18.67]Use the turn very loosely.
[105:23.36]Auto-cannon.
[105:24.60]Okay, that's one of the best items in the game.
[105:29.30]Where are we going next?
[105:29.94]We're gonna go down right here.
[105:48.01]Yeah.
[105:48.31]I think I got too many grenades, too, for the first level.
[105:55.77]Maybe.
[105:56.05]Away from me.
[106:06.60]Oh, fuck.
[106:08.64]Green slime.
[106:09.66]Screwed my head there.
[106:10.54]Is there anything else I wanna do here?
[106:15.70]Go up that way, grab the tech.
[106:23.29]Why do I never play Nuclear Throne?
[106:24.93]I don't know.
[106:26.56]It just never really appealed to me very much.
[106:30.04]I thought it was a cool concept, but back when I... Oh boy, hold on.
[106:35.02]I've got to pay attention here.
[106:40.88]These enemies are awful.
[106:42.02]They just shoot back.
[106:42.82]They blow your stuff in random directions.
[106:49.69]Trench gun.
[106:50.69]Pretty good.
[106:54.18]That game was very, very early when I first got, like, a chance to see it.
[106:57.56]And, like, they've been doing a ton of updates to it.
[106:59.76]It's been getting a lot of, uh, updates pretty much, like, every other week or something, right?
[107:05.84]I don't know.
[107:06.20]It's something I never really got into.
[107:08.08]One more.
[107:17.59]Yeah!
[107:23.78]I think I got all three of the bonuses, too.
[107:27.83]What's this, an EU-friendly stream?
[107:32.57]It is.
[107:34.25]It's like afternoon.
[107:35.05]Plus three max hull?
[107:37.49]Oh, okay, no, wait a minute.
[107:40.81]I guess I screwed that up.
[107:42.18]I did that wrong.
[107:47.70]Honestly, games like this...
[107:49.98]that are very, very difficult that require a ton of precision.
[107:54.06]Like a huge amount of concentration and a ton of like bullet dodging and... I just... my brain can't do it.
[108:03.31]I get stuck in walls, I overreact and bad shit happens to me.
[108:13.60]I screw up one thing and then it's just a chain reaction.
[108:17.26]But I have an autocannon now so that's really amazing.
[108:22.08]Gonna put it on here.
[108:24.36]Really expensive.
[108:27.38]Max loadout 60k.
[108:28.30]I don't even care.
[108:33.00]Got a trench gun.
[108:39.45]No, I'll stay with the machine gun for now.
[108:42.59]I don't even actually know.
[108:43.73]Take the autocannon off.
[108:44.65]It's unnecessary for right now.
[108:47.81]It's just too much money.
[108:48.93]It's like a level 2 place.
[108:50.13]I don't need to do that.
[108:54.36]So let's instead put the blaster back on.
[108:58.36]I will take another heal this time, though.
[109:02.09]No, I won't.
[109:03.93]I'm going to take... I think I'm just going to stay with that.
[109:07.47]Do I need a key, maybe?
[109:14.35]Go right up here.
[109:17.62]Drone factory.
[109:18.56]Yeah, drone factories are a huge deal.
[109:21.70]They just keep spawning enemies.
[109:25.97]Can't do bullet dodging, but plays pretty well in Isaac.
[109:32.12]Isaac, I don't know.
[109:33.12]Isaac is a lot slower.
[109:35.30]Right?
[109:36.02]Isaac is a lot more deliberate and slower.
[109:38.31]The rooms are small and there's not a whole lot of things in the room.
[109:43.24]This game, and the games like Nuclear Throne, and games that are in this kind of genre, there's so much stuff happening around you that it is almost impossible to slow down and know what you're doing unless you have really good lightning reaction speeds.
[109:59.42]That GPS wanted to take me in a really, really awful direction.
[110:15.87]And plus, I don't know, I like the Team Meat games.
[110:19.57]Like Isaac Meat Boy, they're like very fun, interesting games to me.
[110:23.03]Alright, where am I going here?
[110:27.07]I'm gonna go down in here.
[110:35.59]Don't wanna get rid of that yet.
[110:36.71]I'm scared to even touch that, actually.
[110:53.49]Oh shit!
[110:54.43]Oh fuck, I forgot.
[110:55.97]Where did it take me?
[110:56.50]I don't even know where it put me.
[111:00.02]Hopefully not that far away.
[111:01.66]No, thank god it didn't put me somewhere else.
[111:03.34]Horrible.
[111:04.70]Forgot when you blow up those things they do that.
[111:14.92]Is that affected by the alarm?
[111:15.92]I don't think so.
[111:18.74]But I'm on a mission.
[111:35.41]There we go.
[111:36.29]No!
[111:40.13]I'll keep alarm systems.
[111:41.93]I hate the alarm systems.
[111:43.13]I despise them.
[111:44.13]So I'm totally happy with just blowing them up.
[111:48.05]No supply pods.
[111:49.01]I do want to take out these.
[111:51.33]This drone factory though.
[111:55.75]No supply pods.
[111:56.93]I can do that.
[111:57.57]Key...
[112:14.50]Instead of staying away from that shit.
[112:21.30]Sorry I'm not looking at chat right now.
[112:23.04]This game requires 100% of your attention.
[112:35.18]It's very good though.
[112:37.68]It's very good.
[112:38.44]And it's in early access.
[112:41.33]Somehow, this early access game feels like it's been done for a while.
[112:47.03]I don't need a key.
[112:56.54]Alright, that's it.
[112:57.26]That's all there is to it.
[113:03.55]I can actually cook the grenades.
[113:04.57]I don't know why I'm not doing that more often.
[113:19.98]Kaboom.
[113:24.92]Is the game free?
[113:25.46]The game is not free.
[113:27.43]I think it's like... 10 bucks?
[113:30.35]15, 10, 12, something like that.
[113:32.17]I think it's on sale.
[113:34.29]Initially here.
[113:43.60]Burn out all resources.
[113:45.04]Get rid of them.
[113:58.94]You have your SATs today?
[114:01.18]Or your PEI?
[114:02.52]What is it?
[114:02.76]What's a PEI?
[114:03.26]It's something like that.
[114:03.96]It's the original, the first one.
[114:05.76]The pre-SATs.
[114:13.81]I actually don't have frequently asked questions.
[114:16.21]I feel bad for people that are kind of just coming in here and being like, oh, what is this?
[114:22.87]I'm not a streamer yet.
[114:27.01]I'm kind of trying to.
[114:30.47]I've got money now.
[114:39.60]We'll stay with a three.
[114:40.40]Because these are very hard.
[114:44.90]Really, like, last time when I streamed this game, I was doing the hardest ones.
[114:50.35]I was going in with chain guns on every slot.
[114:53.99]It was really stupid.
[114:56.51]So I'm just going to stay nice and safe in my comfortable three.
[115:00.67]It eventually is going to be five, but just to get past the first few areas, there's no reason, in my opinion, to blow money and waste it because you're trying to do the extremely difficult ships.
[115:16.62]48,000 followers and he's just starting out.
[115:18.84]Well, here's my streamer story.
[115:23.48]Here's the tale of my stream.
[115:26.59]I streamed, I've been like doing YouTube and stuff.
[115:29.52]For those of you that have just somehow found this channel, and you have no idea what's going on, I do like YouTube.
[115:37.00]I mostly do YouTube.
[115:39.30]And like four years ago, I livestreamed.
[115:43.57]Like maybe once or twice a week for a while.
[115:46.27]And then I stopped for two straight years.
[115:50.55]So like all these followers, I would say probably like 70% of the people that followed this stream like four years ago, or like three years ago, that's where the majority of those followers came from.
[116:03.66]Now, I'm starting to start it back up again, and get back into it a little bit, I guess you could say.
[116:16.75]Should I do zip gun?
[116:18.61]Yeah, we're gonna go zip gun.
[116:20.46]I love this thing.
[116:23.64]Zip gun will keep the blaster.
[116:26.32]Did I get any different grenades?
[116:27.78]Sticky grenades.
[116:28.64]They're more expensive.
[116:32.88]I'm at 100k.
[116:34.18]Can't max 100k.
[116:37.94]If I do another fixer, will that...
[116:43.01]That'll bring me to 10.
[116:44.23]I could get rid of the Blatt.
[116:47.28]No.
[116:47.38]Can I get... I'll just stick with the regular grenades.
[116:52.56]That way I can stay under 100k.
[116:53.80]Do you think if you started a new channel on YouTube and no one knew who you were, could you become big again?
[117:04.25]I don't know, man.
[117:05.61]It's a lot more difficult.
[117:07.66]If you want to start streaming or start doing YouTube or start getting into this kind of, I guess you could call it like a scene.
[117:14.82]Back when I started five years ago, there weren't as many people doing it.
[117:18.16]Then, you know, fast forward a few years.
[117:21.22]You go down, just go to like browse a random game on Twitch.
[117:24.67]Even if you open up like one of the popular games.
[117:27.56]There are, like, hundreds of potential channels.
[117:30.50]Maybe even at some point, like, in the multiple hundreds and hundreds, maybe even like a thousand channels streaming a really popular game or something.
[117:38.42]At least hundreds.
[117:41.50]So it's hard to stand out.
[117:45.82]Shit, it's got a cloaking device on it.
[117:47.70]That sucks.
[117:52.19]Sensor jammer.
[117:54.35]Repair.
[117:56.67]What else we got?
[117:58.55]This is the most obnoxious, so that has to go.
[118:01.03]This kind of has to go... This has to go first.
[118:10.96]Then this.
[118:13.18]Then this.
[118:14.08]So we're going to go into here.
[118:16.06]I don't think I even have the tech upgrade for the sensor.
[118:21.97]I don't.
[118:23.31]Shit.
[118:23.87]This is going to be annoying.
[118:25.24]This is really, really, really going to be annoying.
[118:26.52]We're going to have to just go in blind.
[118:29.50]I'm just going to make sure I don't die.
[118:32.24]Let's see if there's an entrance up here.
[118:38.91]If there's an entrance up here, I'm going to try to get rid of this, even though it's being held by a repair.
[118:45.01]There is an entrance right here, but I don't want to trip the alarm.
[118:52.23]Oh, son of a bitch.
[118:56.73]Okay.
[118:59.19]Tractor beam.
[119:00.25]It's terrible.
[119:04.50]It's dark in here.
[119:14.10]Oh, come on.
[119:14.64]What did I just get hit by?
[119:16.69]It's too dark.
[119:18.27]I can't see anything.
[119:22.11]I've already taken way too much damage and I don't have a key to get in there.
[119:30.27]Key right there.
[119:32.59]Oh, shit.
[119:41.65]Key.
[119:48.41]These drones.
[119:49.59]I gotta get rid of the drone factory.
[119:52.75]I might be able to go up a different way, but whatever.
[120:03.10]Alright, now that I have a second here.
[120:05.25]Sensor jammer has been deactivated.
[120:06.71]I need to go here.
[120:07.59]I need a key.
[120:08.37]There's a key right there.
[120:09.47]We're golden.
[120:10.49]Let's go.
[120:21.76]Alright, there's a lot of shit on the screen right now.
[120:23.08]I can't even see.
[120:23.92]Key right into here.
[120:26.28]Open up this.
[120:43.09]Oh my goodness, these stupid fucking things.
[120:44.67]I hate these things.
[120:50.21]Alright, now that we have that out of the way...
[120:53.62]Can get rid of the alarm system.
[120:55.14]Yeah, of course I come back and I get hit.
[120:58.98]That sucked.
[121:03.42]I got plenty of ammo.
[121:04.08]It'll be okay.
[121:08.80]That requires a key, too.
[121:10.36]Do I have a key right now?
[121:11.57]No, I don't.
[121:15.63]I might just do this without... Oh, yeah.
[121:18.19]Screw it.
[121:18.79]Who cares about the alarm?
[121:21.72]Destroy sentry systems and no supply pods.
[121:24.68]Where are the sentry systems?
[121:27.50]Way too far out of my way.
[121:31.05]Yeah, we're just gonna go without it.
[121:32.15]We're just gonna get rid of the shield and then just go right there and just trigger the alarm and hopefully we can destroy it fast enough.
[121:40.57]Fuck.
[121:42.23]That's not cool.
[121:55.47]He's behind a locked door.
[122:06.94]Using ammo I didn't want to use.
[122:17.49]Is this behind a locked door, too?
[122:18.97]Please tell me it isn't.
[122:19.90]It is.
[122:20.78]Of course it is.
[122:21.54]But at least there's a key right there.
[122:31.72]Get away from me.
[122:32.97]I saw you do that, you little shit.
[122:44.58]I just fucking hit myself with a grenade.
[122:47.22]I'm being too impatient.
[122:48.90]I gotta slow it down.
[122:50.16]I'm being too impatient.
[122:56.98]Let's get that key.
[123:00.69]There's so many things in that room.
[123:02.37]It really... How much time do I have left?
[123:05.61]Not a whole lot.
[123:06.99]And I don't think there's any more to loot.
[123:07.91]No, we're gonna have to go just boss the wall.
[123:10.71]Just gonna have to go for it.
[123:11.99]I'm running out of ammo, too.
[123:16.38]So we're just gonna go destroy it, and hope I can just spam grenades at it.
[123:21.26]And be able to win.
[123:34.79]Anything in that room?
[123:35.67]No.
[123:46.14]Alright, boys and girls.
[123:51.95]We're going for spam strats.
[123:59.25]I might have to clear this room a little, though.
[124:02.63]There's so much shit.
[124:04.27]Spam strats.
[124:09.69]Holy dog shit.
[124:12.39]Oh my god!
[124:17.70]I don't even know where I am, I don't know what happened.
[124:20.52]That, holy fuck, did you see how much stuff was in that room?
[124:27.33]There were like four laser turrets on the walls.
[124:31.79]I actually did not, I saw the stuff, okay, well that was dumb.
[124:37.95]Everything was behind a locked door and I didn't have any keys.
[124:40.34]That sucked.
[124:45.48]This time I'm going to look and see it, because if like every single goddamn door is locked, then I need to like bring a key.
[124:51.06]Because that was really fucking annoying.
[124:58.15]Oh, what's this?
[124:59.49]There's two locked doors in this whole place this time?
[125:03.71]And look, I can just go... Holy crap.
[125:10.24]Are you shitting me?
[125:16.34]Well, that's what happens when you roll the dice on a procedurally generated game.
[125:20.34]Sometimes every single door will be locked, and sometimes the brain will be protected by the shield that's literally 50 feet away from it.
[125:30.91]That's the way the cookie crumbles.
[125:38.49]Look at this.
[125:38.89]Uh-oh, guys.
[125:41.11]I better watch out for this locked door.
[125:43.97]How will I ever get in there?
[125:46.49]How am I ever going to get inside of that locked door?
[125:49.47]Shit.
[125:49.75]Alright.
[125:55.09]Enough complaining.
[125:55.91]Let's play.
[126:02.50]Let me make sure there's nothing in here.
[126:07.58]I don't care about that.
[126:10.39]I could just get...
[126:11.92]Yeah, I'm just... We're just going to do the same thing.
[126:15.09]There's no alarm system in this one either.
[126:19.29]This one should be fairly easy.
[126:24.51]Whoever made that door to lock it was shit-faced.
[126:33.38]I'm just going to do auto-cannon.
[126:36.42]Get the auto-cannon and get in there and just blow it down.
[126:41.89]Sounds good.
[126:44.71]I don't need any keys, right?
[126:46.83]Because all these doors are open.
[126:49.73]Except for this one.
[126:50.47]I need one key.
[126:52.61]Go in there, get the tech, and then beat the level in less than a minute.
[127:04.07]This game is Cryptarch.
[127:05.55]It's on Steam right now.
[127:08.02]I'm not sure about if it's coming to consoles or not.
[127:10.26]I don't know.
[127:10.84]I really just don't have any idea.
[127:11.78]I wish I could give you that intel.
[127:19.81]Whoa, shit.
[127:20.77]Hold on.
[127:22.35]Make sure I'm going the right way here.
[127:24.01]Yeah, I am.
[127:32.13]There's no alarm system, so I don't have to be worried about anything besides just clearing this room.
[127:41.32]I guess I'd put the shield down.
[127:48.76]God, those things are so horrible.
[128:00.15]Those things do like two points of damage a hit, and they're so, so brutal.
[128:04.99]Okay, this room's okay now.
[128:06.77]I'm just gonna do this.
[128:08.29]Watch out, guys.
[128:10.02]Shit.
[128:10.72]How are we gonna get rid of this?
[128:24.15]Oh, that's a bad way to go.
[128:30.96]Oh wow, holy fuck.
[128:34.04]I was wrong.
[128:36.17]I forgot that.
[128:36.85]I forgot it's not the one... Okay, right.
[128:39.11]That's what I get for not paying attention to that.
[128:52.94]Damn.
[128:53.22]At least there's no alarm system.
[129:02.73]Put your shield down.
[129:09.59]There's a lot of these turrets in this one too, unfortunately.
[129:16.61]I might actually get the... Yeah, I'm gonna get it.
[129:28.54]I just totally forgot that it did whatever it was connected to.
[129:32.14]What was that shielding then?
[129:33.92]That's the question.
[129:53.00]This whole level is turrets.
[129:56.48]Yikes.
[130:10.07]More locks.
[130:12.57]At least, we're the ones those are connected to.
[130:18.73]Kinetic buffer?
[130:20.51]Never heard of that one.
[130:29.94]Ah, you are so annoying.
[130:31.64]You are very, very annoying.
[130:34.04]Alright, so that will take that down.
[130:40.77]What was it?
[130:41.11]I have to destroy the flak controllers.
[130:43.37]Oh, that's not a flak controller.
[130:45.96]Did I already get them all?
[130:51.74]I got all the flak controllers.
[130:52.86]I don't even need to do that.
[130:55.86]Because now there's nothing protecting you, but wasn't... what?
[131:06.18]I'm kind of confused here.
[131:12.84]I'm confused.
[131:21.39]Oh, tech.
[131:22.85]Is there any more tech?
[131:23.71]I don't have, like, any tech.
[131:25.05]There's one up there.
[131:27.89]Kind of running out of time, but whatever.
[131:32.45]Whatever.
[131:33.63]Let's just get rid of it.
[131:39.80]Or I could go into, like, the nest.
[132:02.78]Do you have to destroy everything before... No, you don't.
[132:06.04]That's why I was confused.
[132:06.86]Did I even take out another... I want to watch that part of the stream back.
[132:11.58]Because I took out the shield, and it was still shielded.
[132:17.17]But the thing that I destroyed up there, that wasn't a shield, was it?
[132:19.71]Was the thing that I went up there a shield?
[132:23.45]I don't know.
[132:25.33]Apparently not.
[132:45.27]Where am I going now?
[132:47.65]It was the redundancy building?
[132:52.21]Potentially.
[133:03.68]A door lock system and something else, I guess.
[133:05.48]Yeah, that... I want to watch that part back.
[133:07.72]Because I have no idea.
[133:13.30]That's very odd.
[133:18.94]Definitely keeping the auto cannon, though.
[133:20.08]I wish I had a different machine gun.
[133:21.90]These are... You know.
[133:25.42]The current game is Victivran.
[133:27.48]It's not... It is not Victivran.
[133:41.11]Nightbot, Nightbot, you really screwed this up.
[133:52.48]Yeah, I'll put on a shotgun.
[133:55.52]I need more ammo than that though.
[133:57.04]What's the max loadout?
[133:58.42]60k.
[133:58.69]I'm not gonna be able to do that.
[134:02.17]Yeah, this is the Victor Bran of the future.
[134:07.31]The current game is Victor Bran.
[134:12.31]This Victor Bran game sure looks fun.
[134:18.02]It really is... I might just stay just tried and true with the machine gun.
[134:21.88]It's just too good.
[134:24.61]And the autocannon.
[134:27.91]Yeah, we're just gonna stay with that.
[134:29.49]Unless I got a new... What did I... I got something new, didn't I?
[134:32.83]Laser.
[134:46.91]That's really expensive.
[134:48.56]I'm not gonna do it.
[134:54.70]Okay.
[134:59.35]Repair station up here.
[135:00.49]Is there more than one repairer?
[135:02.89]There are more than... Oh, these are the worst.
[135:08.41]These are the worst.
[135:12.85]Yeah, I have a Twitch partnership from like four years ago.
[135:15.99]So whatever the partnership was four years ago is the one that I have.
[135:21.31]So when you have two repair stations, it really sucks because you have to end up going in and both of these pretty much have to be destroyed.
[135:27.32]So I'm gonna have to go down.
[135:38.92]Yeah, we're gonna go in here.
[135:39.66]We're gonna go down.
[135:41.52]There's a key.
[135:42.22]I have a key.
[135:43.98]There's also one there.
[135:44.84]I need a key to get into the... There are more locked doors everywhere.
[135:49.67]I picked the wrong one.
[135:57.09]Does this guy really deserve to have his gaming license back?
[135:59.21]He's still going around using a faulty nightbot.
[136:02.42]No, I don't have it back.
[136:04.06]I have my learner's permit.
[136:10.33]Yeah, we're going to go down.
[136:11.45]I got a key.
[136:12.13]There's a key right there I can take.
[136:13.19]And we're going to destroy the two repair stations as we go.
[136:18.97]Sound good to you?
[136:19.49]Sounds good to me.
[136:20.91]How about it?
[136:25.94]I do not want to go that way.
[136:28.86]My GPS device is freaking out.
[136:33.24]Greetings from Bulgaria.
[136:35.40]Hi.
[136:36.04]Greetings from the United States.
[136:41.19]I gotta go all the way up.
[136:42.15]This is gonna be a long one.
[136:43.59]I don't know if I have faith in this one.
[136:57.60]It might not even be worth destroying that droid facility just yet.
[137:06.09]But, I don't know.
[137:06.75]I don't know how much time I'm gonna have.
[137:13.53]Because if there's two repair facilities, I'm gonna have to haul ass after this is destroyed.
[137:28.46]Gotta go, gotta go.
[137:29.30]Haul ass.
[137:36.06]Oh shit, that's the thing that blows up, right?
[137:40.81]No, I don't want to go that way.
[137:41.57]That's a waste of a key.
[137:43.29]You see what I'm saying?
[137:43.89]With two of those facilities going... It's hard to... Yeah, it's gonna come back.
[137:51.49]But at least they got rid of some of those drones without being too much of a pain in the ass.
[137:59.10]I really wish you two weren't so annoying.
[138:01.96]I really wish you weren't that annoying.
[138:05.74]You're just blocking the way in!
[138:08.36]You chump!
[138:09.06]Get out of the way!
[138:17.01]Oh my god.
[138:21.04]And everything he hits is getting repaired too.
[138:22.80]And his tiny little room.
[138:27.62]Oh, that was horrible.
[138:32.35]Have to get rid of this other one quick quick quick quick quick.
[138:41.79]Alright, call me crazy.
[138:43.95]You can go ahead and call me crazy.
[138:46.37]I'm going around the ship.
[138:49.56]I'm gonna go around the damn ship and go in the not-so-hostile way.
[138:53.06]20%.
[138:58.04]Alright, which way?
[139:00.97]Right in here and then down and around.
[139:02.81]Where is that?
[139:05.21]I need to get that fucking key.
[139:11.18]right is there a key right there nope where's the key up there how much time do I got 41
[139:36.82]No, what?
[139:37.91]No.
[139:38.63]What the hell?
[139:40.15]Oh my god.
[139:42.23]What the fuck?
[139:43.87]I'm trying to open a door.
[139:45.05]Refill ammo?
[139:49.31]No, I don't want to refill ammo.
[139:50.46]Okay, well now just get destroyed because you didn't open the door.
[139:52.90]I'm very, very angry.
[139:56.24]At least I got it.
[140:08.39]Let's get rid of this.
[140:10.64]Now I can take my time, because now things aren't respawning every two seconds.
[140:15.08]Get trolled.
[140:30.05]I actually am going to take this, because I want the cannon.
[140:38.17]The cannon is just so amazing.
[140:40.50]That door's locked.
[140:41.26]Is that stuck in there?
[140:45.60]Can I not even go in that room?
[140:52.48]Oh, I'm gonna have to reroute this.
[140:56.81]I can't get in there.
[140:59.81]Can I, like, cheese it and get it?
[141:00.89]No.
[141:00.95]Okay.
[141:07.44]Holy shit.
[141:08.58]Are you kidding me?
[141:12.24]I'll see you in hell.
[141:16.40]Get out of my way.
[141:37.19]I really want to shut this alarm off.
[141:38.65]Is it worth me doing the key?
[141:41.78]I will do this.
[141:44.98]Don't want the alarm to go off.
[141:46.30]Because there are so many horrible things in that room down there.
[141:49.64]I would not want to get swarmed with everything.
[141:51.32]Can you get out of here?
[142:02.33]What are you doing in here?
[142:03.23]Like, are you going to be a hero?
[142:05.03]I don't think so, dude.
[142:16.80]Well, so... If you'd like to know what happened right there... My game froze.
[142:22.66]And I just didn't move.
[142:25.68]And now we're probably freezing?
[142:27.81]I don't... I think so.
[142:28.67]Kind of.
[142:30.11]A little.
[142:36.07]After trying to avoid all that for the game to freeze... And me get hit by the alarm... That's just fucking fantastic.
[142:53.12]I need to look and see if there's one anywhere.
[143:01.59]There is, but it's all the way over there.
[143:03.37]I need to just sit in a corner and... Please game, please stop doing this.
[143:10.95]I'm gonna like sit in this corner until this ends.
[143:12.38]Okay.
[143:18.25]Nope.
[143:21.98]I should be able to get back, though, with this.
[143:26.72]Come on, come on.
[143:27.94]Okay.
[143:29.92]This is gonna be very, very difficult to do this.
[143:40.25]I'm running out of time, but even if you run out of time, you don't lose.
[143:44.65]But look at all the stuff that's in here.
[143:46.09]This was a terrible, terrible one.
[143:56.00]I'm gonna just die.
[143:57.46]Because I want to restart the game.
[144:02.56]It just, for some reason, is doing, like, stuttering all over the place.
[144:06.08]Give me a second.
[144:06.66]Give me one second.
[144:09.00]It saves my progress, don't worry.
[144:14.36]Don't worry, my progress is saved.
[144:15.60]Oh...
[144:30.33]How do I exit?
[144:32.03]Like that.
[144:40.87]I remember me and Star were talking about this the other day.
[144:44.69]This game is amazing.
[144:46.47]Except for when it does that.
[144:53.55]Should be right here.
[144:56.09]Okie dokie.
[144:56.83]Yeah, that's Grover.
[145:01.75]That's supposed to be good old Grover.
[145:10.01]Yeah, that hold on screen was like $40.
[145:15.17]I paid myself $40.
[145:15.97]Alright, are we good?
[145:31.03]I think so.
[145:32.03]I hope so.
[145:32.43]Because that's a real run killer.
[145:46.14]Keep the alarm systems.
[145:47.56]Auto-canon.
[145:53.94]I'm gonna put the stickies on.
[145:55.22]I like the sticky grenades a little bit better, I think.
[145:57.71]I think.
[146:02.85]Now let's see what we got this time.
[146:08.76]Oh, for the love of God, no.
[146:11.58]Another one of these.
[146:12.26]I gotta try to get rid of that.
[146:22.91]Is there any repair things?
[146:24.11]Yeah, all the way down here.
[146:31.22]Ooh, I'm gonna go around this way.
[146:32.54]These have to go down first.
[146:34.28]Otherwise, buildings just come back.
[146:40.72]Why don't you ever stream on normal USA times instead of, like, 7am?
[146:46.08]Because I'm trying to stay awake.
[146:50.52]I'm trying to reset my sleep schedule, in a way.
[146:56.82]Max 100k.
[146:57.58]What's my loadout right now?
[146:59.32]123.
[146:59.34]That's too much money.
[147:06.28]Do I even need this key?
[147:07.48]I guess I can't tell if I need the key because I can't see if there are any locked doors.
[147:10.30]So we're going to keep it.
[147:11.03]There's only two throughout this fort.
[147:21.45]Alright, well... I could try to keep... I don't need to take a supply pod, I don't think.
[147:27.79]Keeping the alarm systems is a really awful risky maneuver, but...
[147:32.62]Especially when you can't see anything.
[147:34.20]And I don't have the upgrade to be able to see things to go through it.
[147:38.22]So we're going to try to get rid of the repair facility first.
[147:43.48]I'm going to go down and around.
[147:45.36]Where's my ship?
[147:47.12]Up here.
[147:47.42]Remember to check out Victor Vran!
[147:59.48]Hopefully there's an entryway down here.
[148:03.77]It'd be great if there was one literally right here.
[148:06.16]It'd be amazing.
[148:09.26]Yes, there is.
[148:11.48]But it's dark as hell.
[148:12.66]I think I have a key.
[148:32.54]Ugh.
[148:34.86]They just keep coming from every direction, and I don't know where to go.
[148:38.93]I need to get rid of that sensor so bad.
[148:42.31]I just don't know the efficient way to move that way.
[148:52.47]There is an alarm.
[148:53.97]Don't get touched by that.
[149:20.99]Wish I had a better machine gun.
[149:25.15]I can't even tell what a wall is.
[149:31.00]That's really killing me.
[149:31.72]He's not having a machine gun that's better.
[149:33.26]Like a heavy machine gun or something.
[149:36.56]Hopefully I can go in here.
[149:37.59]Please tell me I can go in there and get it.
[149:43.71]Looks like there's an up.
[149:45.71]No.
[149:53.39]Oh my goodness.
[149:54.13]Get away from me.
[149:58.53]No, I can't go.
[149:59.47]I gotta go up through here.
[150:10.66]damn it come on give me like a sneaky back entrance while I waste all this time looking for how to move in this area thank you please let there be light
[150:42.28]I don't want you to get away from me.
[150:45.16]Please.
[150:49.52]I got no shield.
[150:50.18]I need a second for it to charge back up so I don't die.
[151:08.77]Ugh.
[151:10.69]Ow, my brain!
[151:12.83]Bullet hell!
[151:21.87]If only the darkness wasn't consuming my body.
[151:30.01]I can see.
[151:30.43]Thank god.
[151:38.18]Now we gotta go down here.
[151:42.35]Key, key, key, key, key.
[151:46.99]It'll be so safe if I go down that way.
[151:55.95]I love me a sneaky back entrance.
[151:59.67]There's a key here, but I mean, might as well just go that way anyways.
[152:05.16]Just don't want to take unnecessary damage.
[152:06.90]I don't have any heals left.
[152:12.29]I got 16 shots in the cannon.
[152:13.81]I'm running out of ammo.
[152:19.51]Thankfully there's not a whole lot left.
[152:20.67]Is there a supply pod somewhere on the way?
[152:22.51]We're going to play it safe.
[152:31.52]I'm going to refill my ammo.
[152:35.14]I know it'll be a really, really big deal later.
[152:38.73]And I'm going to be really mad if I didn't get it, you know?
[152:55.71]Keep alarm systems.
[152:59.15]For extra money, I don't know if I want to do that.
[153:02.21]I'm having trouble enough as it is.
[153:18.34]Quick shield.
[153:23.93]No, is it worth it to try to do this?
[153:27.09]No, it's not.
[153:27.95]I just gotta... Don't be a dummy.
[153:32.85]Get rid of the alarm.
[153:33.83]And the things that dash across the whole screen in less than a second.
[153:38.55]Make sure you get rid of those, too.
[153:57.86]I actually might put shield on a face button.
[154:00.24]I feel like that would be a lot easier.
[154:01.94]Rather than have to hold down right click.
[154:03.28]Like the guy said earlier.
[154:06.02]That guy's a smart guy.
[154:07.18]I can't even walk into this room.
[154:16.95]Dear lord.
[154:36.94]Open up.
[154:45.26]Oh boy.
[154:47.14]Be really sneaky on this one.
[154:48.91]I'm running out of health, too.
[154:53.35]That's a concern.
[154:54.29]I don't want you to come up behind me and, like, shoot me right in my spine.
[155:05.41]This is a busy ass room.
[155:12.86]Oh, he just shot that away.
[155:13.82]I'm running into the negative time here.
[155:21.34]Whoa, getting stuck on shit.
[155:54.81]40 seconds into the time.
[155:56.71]Damn.
[156:01.93]I think I'm going to lose money.
[156:03.05]I'm running low on funds.
[156:11.98]Why am I called Jerma?
[156:13.74]My name is Jeremy.
[156:15.70]That's it.
[156:21.30]Well, this is where we lose.
[156:22.96]For sure.
[156:24.25]I only have 260,000.
[156:24.63]This is going to be extremely difficult.
[156:30.79]And you know how I do when it comes to, like, extremely difficult things.
[156:37.18]Maybe we'll see.
[156:40.02]What have we got there?
[156:40.80]Let me look at the other ones.
[156:44.70]Two repair ones.
[156:45.60]Forget this one.
[156:46.36]Two alarms and two repairs.
[156:49.54]This one only has one alarm and one repair.
[156:54.62]Look at all the stuff in this one.
[156:57.84]Jeez.
[157:05.32]Did you do the... Yes, I was the... I'm the engineer in this game.
[157:11.11]I'm like the tutorial and I tell you all kinds of things and... I teach you about how to play.
[157:18.47]All that stuff.
[157:23.38]Did you get my FOD email?
[157:24.74]I did.
[157:24.98]I opened it up, and I immediately closed it.
[157:28.69]You stunk up my office, dude.
[157:29.93]Thanks.
[157:35.59]Let's look at this.
[157:37.49]Thankfully, we don't have to deal with a sensor.
[157:42.83]Seven minutes.
[157:45.24]Shabbat b'etch.
[157:46.24]Shabbat b'etch is all I gave you.
[157:50.64]Only one repair, which is good, and it's right in the front door.
[157:56.65]The juggernauts are a real huge issue if they're not taken out.
[158:04.18]I think we're just gonna have to go slow here.
[158:06.60]And take out like every single thing in this whole area.
[158:09.42]This whole part of the game here.
[158:12.64]We're gonna go down with it.
[158:14.21]And then we're gonna go up with it.
[158:15.75]And then we're gonna go right out this door.
[158:18.43]And wham bam.
[158:20.47]Right into the core.
[158:24.53]No, we are not.
[158:25.17]We are not going to do that.
[158:25.95]We're going to go here first.
[158:28.03]Because that's a nuclear device.
[158:30.11]Which means in this tiny little cramped area, if I destroy one of these, it makes a nuke... A giant nuke explosion happens and we'll just kill you.
[158:37.30]So we're going to go up there first.
[158:39.02]Are there any more of those?
[158:42.26]No.
[158:45.35]So we got to go here.
[158:48.61]Oh, you know what?
[158:52.46]I could destroy this first and just get the hell out of here.
[158:55.64]Come up here and then destroy that.
[158:57.82]Which is, yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
[158:58.82]That's a better idea.
[158:59.44]Because then I won't be able to repair.
[159:00.94]I'm going to do that.
[159:05.02]This is Cryptarch.
[159:06.20]Are you just joining us?
[159:09.94]Yeah, the point of the game is you make a loadout.
[159:13.27]You go and you destroy the cores.
[159:14.59]You have to destroy cores.
[159:16.77]Everything's randomly procedurally generated.
[159:20.27]My mouse is lagging.
[159:26.45]Why is that happening now?
[159:27.37]There we go.
[159:28.13]That was weird.
[159:29.89]Everything's procedurally generated, which means you can get severely screwed.
[159:35.00]Or, you know, it could be like a walk in the park.
[159:38.76]This one shouldn't be too bad, and I say that before we get going.
[159:43.82]We all know how stuff like that goes, though.
[159:50.32]Where I'm really taking a big hurt hit here, I'm not picking up enough tech upgrades, so I'm stuck with the medium machine guns.
[160:00.21]Which really, at this stage of the game, you need to be doing a lot more damage.
[160:07.87]And all I've picked up, I've gotten all the shotguns, but I'm not a fan of the shotguns.
[160:12.87]Unless it's like an assault shotgun.
[160:16.74]I do have this though, which is thankfully really, really good.
[160:25.62]Quick Shield is hard to use.
[160:27.34]So I don't want to use it.
[160:28.28]Laser.
[160:30.45]I'm tempted to try the laser, but I don't think I want to.
[160:32.77]Because I want to try to at least get to the Crypt Arc.
[160:35.49]Maybe.
[160:36.31]If that's possible.
[160:37.11]Or at least get to... I might just die here.
[160:39.55]This is going to be really hard, probably.
[160:43.49]We're going to go with the Zip Gun, though.
[160:46.33]No, we aren't.
[160:48.60]I need to save money.
[161:05.02]I'll stay with the 50.
[161:05.78]Those are so necessary to destroy the big tanky things.
[161:11.19]I only have two types of grenades, so they're staying.
[161:14.01]And I'll keep the 5-5 and the key.
[161:15.77]You never know when you're going to need a key.
[161:20.93]Except not this time, because there's no locked doors that I need to go into.
[161:23.94]If I go there, up here, that's not locked.
[161:29.64]This is also not locked.
[161:31.40]And none of these are locked.
[161:32.90]So that key can...
[161:35.58]Kind of just go in the trash.
[161:38.10]Save myself a few thousand G's.
[161:43.75]Oh... I like... That sounds really cool.
[161:51.69]I shoot more and they're more accurate.
[161:55.97]For 15 grand?
[161:56.51]Well, we kind of have to put all of our money in the pot anyways, because if I lose here, I pretty much lose the game.
[162:03.95]Do you need good PC specs to run this?
[162:05.73]I don't think so.
[162:07.77]The only problem that this game has is, like, what happened last time, is it's a very precise game that you need to, like, be paying a lot of attention to.
[162:16.04]And sometimes the game will just hang.
[162:18.86]You know, that typical, like, the game just, like, kind of stops for, like, two seconds, and it'll just get you killed.
[162:26.03]Even if that happens for, like, a quarter of a second.
[162:28.47]A game like this that requires, like, quarter of a second reflexes, that, like, it'll screw you up.
[162:34.96]And it happens in this game.
[162:38.44]But they're probably going to iron that out.
[162:40.48]It is early access, so I'm sure they're doing all kinds of bug fixes and stuff.
[162:44.49]It is a very, very, very fun game.
[162:46.51]Extremely difficult, but very, very, very fun.
[162:49.89]Let's stop talking about it.
[162:50.85]Let's just show it.
[162:52.01]Let's take a look, huh?
[162:53.68]Whoa.
[162:54.02]I don't think I've even seen this enemy before.
[162:56.68]It's like a reaper.
[162:59.11]Fucking mine.
[162:59.85]Right off the bat.
[163:00.95]Two mines.
[163:02.33]There's a room full of mines.
[163:03.65]That was a room full of mines.
[163:05.13]Slow.
[163:06.61]Calm down.
[163:06.99]Calm down.
[163:07.47]Calm it down.
[163:17.55]Great!
[163:20.48]Stick me in a room with eight mines in it.
[163:22.44]In the front door.
[163:29.45]Now I'm minus 4 health.
[163:41.45]Now I gotta be even more careful.
[163:42.65]Alright, there's a tech upgrade up there.
[163:48.98]Alarm lure, I don't need that.
[163:53.40]I don't need that!
[164:15.24]That's the detonator, right?
[164:16.86]And that's the juggernaut factory.
[164:18.20]I don't- I do not want to be killing that.
[164:21.74]Gotta go down and around.
[164:22.62]I'm gonna go through the huge guy, great.
[164:24.22]We're gonna go this way.
[164:31.37]Okay, I gotta go.
[164:34.67]Fucking mine!
[164:35.73]Another mine!
[164:36.33]Get out of the way!
[164:42.27]Shoulda got that key!
[164:43.39]Shoulda got that key!
[164:45.91]Shoulda got that damn key.
[164:47.45]Remember I said I didn't need a key?
[164:50.49]Ugh.
[164:52.79]At least it's gone.
[164:53.57]I feel like this is kind of a safe haven down here.
[165:05.84]Mine.
[165:08.77]Alright, this is a drone factory.
[165:10.35]It's gonna do the explosion.
[165:12.09]I can actually outrun it if I go all the way up.
[165:15.16]I'm gonna go for it.
[165:15.86]Repair station is dead.
[165:21.57]Let me get all the stuff down here that I need.
[165:25.93]Rail cannon, I don't even know what that is.
[165:31.84]Here comes a juggernaut.
[165:33.20]That's a dead end.
[165:34.94]You shitbag.
[165:42.85]Okay.
[165:44.11]Calm down.
[165:49.76]Let's go get rid of that thing up there.
[165:55.92]That will stop the buildings from exploding.
[165:59.18]Hopefully.
[165:59.80]That would be great.
[166:02.04]So there's no mines in the front door?
[166:07.81]Inside the fucking sealant vent?
[166:17.87]Something.
[166:18.31]Oh my god, these mines are gonna drive me crazy.
[166:20.30]I can't even see.
[166:39.82]I'd like to see.
[166:48.55]I'm not gonna get that yet.
[166:50.01]There's a juggernaut in here.
[166:53.29]There's a juggernaut in here with me.
[166:57.48]There's two juggernauts in here.
[167:00.54]Oh, what a mess.
[167:03.98]There's nowhere I can go.
[167:05.26]I have to get that repair.
[167:06.30]I gotta get this.
[167:10.60]What?
[167:12.62]I'm dead.
[167:14.63]Yeah, I'm dead.
[167:16.11]Two juggernauts in a tiny little room with all these explosions.
[167:18.61]Game over.
[167:21.84]Holy shit, that was impossible.
[167:25.94]Without any more ammo in that cannon, my default machine gun?
[167:30.38]GG.
[167:30.72]There's no way I was beating that one.
[167:34.62]If you're curious, the juggernauts, they spawn every minute, I think?
[167:38.09]Or every two minutes?
[167:40.05]If you don't destroy the juggernaut towns.
[167:44.71]And they take... It's pretty much a giant tank that has explosions that shoot out of it.
[167:50.51]And they were just two things.
[167:52.47]There were two of them in that room.
[167:56.59]And there was no escaping them.
[167:57.75]With turrets all over the walls.
[167:59.33]Shit.
[168:03.73]Well, I lost.
[168:05.60]Game over.
[168:10.22]There's Cryptarch.
[168:15.97]So, I got to two before the Crypt Dark, before I died.
[168:23.49]But that's, like, that's the worst part, right?
[168:25.05]Is, like, so there's, like, ten different building types in this game.
[168:31.41]You, they're all horrible, right?
[168:34.42]You have to, like, pick your poison in this game.
[168:36.38]You either, like, like, for instance, those two juggernaut, the juggernaut stations, or whatever you want to call them.
[168:44.18]If I went and got those first, the nuclear explosion still would have happened.
[168:49.63]If I didn't, you know, if you don't get the nuclear explosion building destroyed, then you screw, every way you're screwing yourself in this game.
[168:58.19]You have to like pick which one you'd rather deal with.
[169:03.29]So, and you saw right there, I decided to try to get rid of the nukes because they take up like the whole screen.
[169:10.12]And I left the juggernaut stations, and then two of them were in the same room with me.
[169:13.94]And then you just die.
[169:16.28]Because if there's that many in a small area, you just shoot the explosive fucking bombs.
[169:24.75]But yeah, that's Crypt Dark.
[169:26.73]I did voice acting work for this game.
[169:27.97]It's really fun.
[169:28.79]It's just excruciatingly difficult.
[169:33.33]If you're into that sort of thing, I highly recommend it.
[169:39.00]I would not recommend playing this game from bed.
[169:44.62]Playing this game from bed would probably be a pretty bad idea.
[169:48.47]You might die.
[169:53.69]There are angels in the outfield, bro.
[169:55.11]You gotta believe.
[169:55.71]Alright, let me switch to this for a second.
[170:11.03]I'm probably going to do a video on it.
[170:12.99]I might do a video on this game.
[170:16.91]Showing the character that I'm doing and stuff.
[170:19.85]Talk about it for a few minutes, maybe.
[170:27.36]Alright, let's close out the stream with a little bit of... It's only $11, too.
[170:37.44]Hold on, Groverman.
[170:38.20]You've got to hold on one second.
[170:49.08]Cryptarch, very fun.
[170:51.12]It's just very dice-rolly.
[170:55.12]Well, you saw some of those places that had, like, you know, almost every door was locked and I didn't have enough keys and I kind of just had to run around like a chick with my head cut off.
[171:06.75]What the fuck is that?
[171:10.55]Did, like, a tractor just drive by my window?
[171:15.89]See, some dude, like, a tractor just drove by.
[171:24.50]I'll close out the stream with a little bit of TF2.
[171:35.45]Why not, right?
[171:49.31]I need to beat that Cryptarch, though.
[171:52.07]I will.
[171:52.79]I will beat the Cryptarch one day.
[172:08.61]I'm going to change my stream title.
[172:12.03]Thanks for hanging out, those of you that are here.
[172:14.17]If it's really early in the morning for you, thanks for chilling.
[172:29.20]While I try to reset my sleep schedule.
[172:32.16]Thanks.
[172:48.69]Hold on a second.
[172:54.36]Okay.
[172:56.04]Let me load up that game that we're talking about.
[173:03.04]Fortress Team.
[173:10.91]Does this mean no Euro streams when you reset the schedule?
[173:13.45]No.
[173:14.64]Not necessarily.
[173:16.16]It just means that it's going to be random times, you know?
[173:20.52]Might be 2 o'clock in the morning, might be 2 p.m., I don't know.
[173:41.94]Change this.
[173:43.88]Give me a second, guys.
[173:56.49]We're just going to go here.
[174:00.01]I don't need to play anything in particular.
[174:01.81]I just kind of want to unwind for a little bit.
[174:10.27]Just want to unwind.
[174:24.26]I know it's a black screen, I'm sorry.
[174:26.84]Sorry about the black screen.
[174:39.77]Well, incoming Chrome, that sounds like a real big problem.
[174:45.67]You might want to call your local doctor's office and ask them what your course of action should probably be.
[175:07.59]Hooray.
[175:09.27]I'm just gonna be a Demoknight freak.
[175:14.79]Demo freak show.
[175:25.24]That was a Windows 7 ding.
[175:27.28]It was.
[175:29.20]I don't have Windows 10.
[175:30.00]You know what?
[175:30.68]I keep accidentally clicking on the Windows 10 thing.
[175:35.58]I don't want to do it.
[175:37.08]Not yet.
[175:37.50]And every time I go down to my taskbar, I end up accidentally having to sit through that loading screen.
[175:48.75]It's probably not a good idea to do this on this map.
[175:52.56]On offense.
[175:54.14]Full Demoknight?
[175:55.52]That's not a good idea.
[176:00.52]Oh god, the unlock abuser Demoknight.
[176:06.02]We're sitting here for forever!
[176:08.54]Let's go!
[176:09.08]I wish there was a way you could speed up the setup time, like hold F and it'll speed it up.
[176:25.05]Soldier around this corner, I think.
[176:29.78]You're a spy, you seem like you are.
[176:41.68]Oh, that was bad.
[176:42.75]That just shot me in the wrong direction.
[176:52.41]Yeah, I'm just doing this to unwind.
[176:53.79]I'm just doing this to unzip, you know.
[176:57.33]Maybe for like a... It could be ten minutes, or it could be like an hour.
[177:02.34]We'll find out, right?
[177:10.73]We'll find out, won't we?
[177:19.96]Anybody in here?
[177:23.58]I'm always so scared to turn this corner because of right there.
[177:26.19]There's always this entry there.
[177:31.15]We're way far ahead now.
[177:45.64]Where the hell is red team?
[177:46.94]What's going on?
[177:49.42]Are we just moving together?
[177:50.98]Is anybody on the other team?
[177:57.01]Okay.
[178:01.35]Are we that far ahead?
[178:01.99]I guess we were.
[178:16.45]Yeah, I was moving.
[178:17.03]That guy, I keep thinking that dude's a spy.
[178:22.19]Every time.
[178:22.53]I don't know if we're just rolling them right now, but... I've seen, like, two people on red this whole time, and one of them was that pyro.
[178:32.28]What?
[178:33.46]What the hell is that guy doing?
[178:42.94]This is... Okay.
[178:44.94]Okay.
[178:47.09]Watch out for this guy.
[178:50.62]He's got arms.
[178:52.64]What is happening with this dude?
[178:55.76]He's got arms coming out of his back.
[178:57.16]He's got four arms.
[178:59.18]And he's about to stick that spy-cicle in his own face.
[179:07.19]Let's go on random.
[179:09.75]This is what's happening.
[179:10.91]Okay.
[179:17.92]Holy shit!
[179:20.66]Is that two Flog Pyros?
[179:21.98]Does that guy have crits?
[179:26.21]Okay, that's fine.
[179:27.47]Oh, he's doing the box trot taunt, but the box isn't showing.
[179:37.11]Iron Bomber.
[179:46.66]Well, that was a crazy round, I guess.
[179:49.98]I saw three people on red team.
[179:53.08]And then I went to red team.
[179:55.10]And then I was locked in by Flawgeistinator Pyros.
[179:59.99]Stop this dancing at once.
[180:01.63]STOP THIS DANCING AT ONCE!
[180:07.82]Oh, how childish.
[180:09.18]How childish of you to be dancing!
[180:16.57]Fucking childish!
[180:27.28]Flog pyros are the true evil in this game.
[180:29.26]Nah, I wouldn't say that.
[180:39.65]So that's a- is that a pyro?
[180:41.39]That's an engineer and a pyro, isn't it?
[180:44.33]Who's two hands are those?
[180:49.52]Yeah, who's hands are those?
[180:51.52]No, that's a Heavy and an Engineer.
[180:52.91]Or is it Heavy and Pyro?
[180:54.69]I forget what all the default loadouts look like.
[180:57.61]Sorry, I'll get you next time.
[181:07.48]Boo.
[181:15.28]Hey!
[181:15.88]Quit dancing, man!
[181:16.64]There's like shit going on outside.
[181:19.81]Look, there's a battle going on.
[181:23.41]We're under attack by a red team.
[181:25.48]There's no time to be dancing in spawn.
[181:33.98]Okay, well, you're over there.
[181:39.56]Where's the Engineer?
[181:57.93]Is this pirate all blowing flames in my face?
[182:00.05]Okay.
[182:11.80]I wish I could hit a shot, that'd be great.
[182:16.67]Oh boy.
[182:16.97]I'm being surrounded.
[182:33.96]Sentry?
[182:34.90]Maybe?
[182:35.36]Sentry?
[182:35.84]Maybe?
[182:36.44]No.
[182:46.17]You gonna try to stair-stab me?
[182:47.37]Is that what you're gonna try to do?
[182:49.01]Come on now, where'd you go?
[182:54.83]Aha!
[183:01.94]Did I just seriously get stabbed right in my face?
[183:05.06]Come on now.
[183:10.52]I was trying to avoid that as best I could, but it still didn't work.
[183:27.21]Team Fortress 2.
[183:42.30]What time is it right now?
[183:43.48]My brain is kind of on ice right now.
[183:46.16]I still haven't gone to bed.
[183:47.06]I STILL HAVEN'T GONE TO BED!
[183:48.76]Noses.
[184:03.97]Shit.
[184:06.89]Alright, I gotta play something.
[184:08.19]What requires, like, zero brain power?
[184:17.44]When did I go to bed last?
[184:18.46]I don't even remember.
[184:22.26]I think it was like 3 or 4 a.m.
[184:26.36]yesterday?
[184:27.14]Day before?
[184:27.64]Whatever it was.
[184:28.14]I don't remember.
[184:31.33]Dude, it's like memento.
[184:33.31]I have no memories.
[184:34.29]Do I have a sandwich?
[184:41.67]I don't think so.
[184:52.18]Oh, shit.
[184:59.55]Hey, when life gives you lemons, play heavy.
[185:08.72]He's still alive.
[185:10.90]Maybe I'll take a knife in my face.
[185:20.72]Don't get me, don't get me!
[185:22.00]I'm ready to go.
[185:42.49]There he is.
[185:49.82]Nobody's on the cars.
[185:50.68]The cars is all the way back there.
[185:57.26]Do a... What did you say?
[185:58.42]Do a what?
[185:58.90]Do a triple... Do a triple chin chair NG for the end of the stream.
[186:08.74]Do it again.
[186:09.48]Do it again.
[186:09.90]Get me again.
[186:10.40]Holy shit, there's another one.
[186:14.72]Come on.
[186:15.42]Come on.
[186:15.64]Which one of you wants it?
[186:16.46]Which one of you wants to get me?
[186:18.02]Huh?
[186:19.31]Which one?
[186:28.83]I wanted to punch that guy.
[186:53.07]I skipped school to watch this?
[186:56.14]Don't do that!
[186:58.00]Let's skip school.
[186:59.12]The stream's ending in like 10 minutes.
[187:02.86]I really hope that's a joke.
[187:07.13]Oh, here we go.
[187:07.73]I skipped school.
[187:08.73]Let's like get out the popcorn.
[187:10.15]I'm gonna watch this live stream.
[187:12.19]He ended the stream.
[187:13.99]Alright, so when that happens, just go to school and just like go with like a tardy notice.
[187:28.86]Be like, I couldn't find my shoes.
[187:31.54]That's a good excuse.
[187:33.92]What teacher can argue that?
[187:36.66]You know what I mean?
[187:37.62]Going to school late?
[187:39.47]Walk up to the front desk?
[187:40.37]Hey, I'm here, I'm late.
[187:43.45]Okay, well, sweetie, why are you late?
[187:47.63]I couldn't find my shoes.
[187:50.93]Oh.
[187:52.35]Okay, well... You found them, obviously, you found them.
[187:56.54]Yeah, I found them, but I couldn't find them before...
[188:00.24]Okay, well, please go to class.
[188:02.12]How are you going to argue that?
[188:04.98]What are you going to say to that?
[188:15.42]That guy's going to be right behind me any second now.
[188:22.83]He's right next to me.
[188:23.63]I want to try to get the medic.
[188:24.63]I'm not going to be able to.
[188:27.79]I'm so paranoid of those two.
[188:30.15]Trying to shoot my own guys.
[188:42.98]I'll stay heavy.
[188:43.82]Why not?
[188:44.70]I'm so tired at this point.
[188:47.42]Playing anything else is just a bad idea.
[188:51.90]I probably just walked the wrong way.
[188:54.95]Hey, you!
[189:04.56]Coming for you.
[189:06.68]Coming for you.
[189:13.36]You saw the flashlight?
[189:15.22]You saw the flash last night.
[189:19.74]The flash movie or the flash, like, TV?
[189:21.56]Isn't there a flash TV show?
[189:31.28]It's so close.
[189:32.57]Somebody get on it.
[189:37.04]Let's go this way.
[189:52.33]Oh shit.
[189:57.94]I skipped my breakfast for this.
[190:13.26]I'm just gonna punch a guy.
[190:14.18]I'm just gonna punch one guy, and then I'm gonna disconnect.
[190:23.97]I would've punched that guy.
[190:26.21]Oh, I did hit him.
[190:26.93]I did punch him once.
[190:27.61]Alright, I'm gonna punch this guy.
[190:41.00]Whoever comes out.
[190:44.95]They're gonna get punched.
[190:51.48]Nobody seems to be coming out of this way.
[191:01.06]Punched him.
[191:08.09]Punched this guy, too.
[191:12.77]We won!
[191:20.63]Who is this guy?
[191:21.33]He sucks at Team Fortress.
[191:23.04]Does he even play Sixes?
[191:25.64]No, I don't.
[191:26.68]I don't play Sixes.
[191:28.00]Sorry.
[191:48.19]Alright, I've been awake for like 20 some odd hours now.
[191:57.04]I think it's time for me to go to bed.
[191:59.16]Or eat food and try to just relax and do something.
[192:05.76]I want to stay up at least another few hours.
[192:18.54]Go to bed.
[192:19.16]Oh, I'm getting phone calls.
[192:30.60]How do they answer this call?
[192:37.70]There's his telephone call.
[192:41.08]They'll call back.
[192:47.74]It's a pretty catchy ringtone, the default one.
[192:49.32]I don't know how the fuck this is.
[193:00.99]Oh, alright, but yeah, I'm gonna take off, guys.
[193:04.98]It has been fun, as always.
[193:07.06]I, uh... I'm gonna go try to work on a video at some point later tonight.
[193:13.84]Maybe upload it tomorrow or the next day.
[193:17.34]We'll see.
[193:19.35]Yeah, I don't know if I'll complete Meepoy.
[193:23.41]Got to the end there, kind of, and I just decided to play Cryptarch.
[193:26.75]And I got my ass kicked in Cryptarch, which is great.
[193:31.20]But yeah.
[193:32.28]Thanks for coming, guys.
[193:33.64]I love you.
[193:36.28]Take it easy.
[193:38.06]Have a good one.
