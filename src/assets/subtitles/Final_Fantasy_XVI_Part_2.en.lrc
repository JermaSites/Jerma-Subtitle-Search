[00:21.52]Hey, what's up?
[00:25.42]What's up?
[00:29.68]Today's the day.
[00:39.71]Final Fantasy 16 is out.
[00:41.91]I've actually been waiting for this.
[00:48.73]Had a lot of fun with the demo.
[00:50.97]I'll give you a quick little update of what the plan is before we get started.
[00:55.41]What about, where's the smurf report?
[00:57.77]Well, what the fuck is that?
[01:02.48]Why did somebody just electrocute the chat with one... Is it a euro?
[01:07.18]What was that?
[01:07.64]Why does it have money?
[01:09.68]Wait, what are these different... Why is there one euro at the top?
[01:16.56]Is there a new money thing?
[01:22.03]Do you see this?
[01:23.47]What is this?
[01:23.93]Pipe.
[01:26.67]Dermago.
[01:29.33]Why is it gone?
[01:29.93]When are you going to take the dino quiz?
[01:39.31]What on Earth is happening?
[01:41.56]Okay, this is weird.
[01:42.48]I feel like I'm...
[01:44.85]I feel like I'm playing a, like, mobile game, and I have to, like, press these to get them.
[01:49.76]Like, if I don't touch these at the top, I feel like I don't get them.
[01:52.90]And they disappear.
[01:53.74]So if I don't click them, do they go away?
[01:59.95]um okay I just to make sure everyone's aware of this I think you're giving real money just to make sure you're clear on that you guys are giving real money right now I don't know I don't know what this is but just be aware this is you're spending real money what is it okay well interesting I think they know
[02:26.38]Play Kingdom Hearts.
[02:28.30]Hold on.
[02:29.38]Hold on a second.
[02:36.06]I think it's bugs in your brain making you see things.
[02:43.77]If this sticks around, I'm going to have to... I think I might have to make a few changes.
[02:52.89]is it can I how do alright well this is interesting alright anyways hello welcome everybody today I'm gonna be playing Final Fantasy 16 sponsored stream thank you to Square Enix for sponsoring this stream I'm very excited to play it I don't know if it was probably wasn't hard to tell at the end of the demo but I genuinely think this is gonna be really fun and here's the best part
[03:22.27]The best part is we don't have to do the demo again.
[03:27.07]Just start right from where we left off in the demo.
[03:31.32]Are you going to do next best?
[03:32.54]I am.
[03:33.06]So here's the thing.
[03:35.54]I was thinking about doing half the stream Final Fantasy and then half the stream as...
[03:43.82]um the next fest but I'd rather just do it this weekend and play sorcery this weekend and okay uh hold on a second let me just do one thing real quick where the hell is your face I my face is is hanging out
[04:14.70]Sorcery needs its own stream.
[04:16.52]We'll figure it out.
[04:17.14]Don't worry.
[04:17.72]Don't worry.
[04:19.08]So wait, these are pinned.
[04:20.26]These are pinned messages and they stay up longer depending on
[04:27.56]Well, I just want to make it really clear.
[04:28.76]I am not clicking on any of these.
[04:30.36]So just, just to be aware, they stay up longer depending how much money you give.
[04:34.70]I just want to make sure everyone's aware.
[04:35.78]I'm not, I haven't clicked on any of them.
[04:38.19]I think the point is like, I'm supposed to click on these and be like, oh, this person has a chat pinned up here.
[04:43.49]They're all gone by the time I click on them.
[04:45.07]I'm not, I'm not going to click on any of these.
[04:46.41]I just want to make sure you know that.
[04:49.87]Well, I'll click on this one.
[04:50.73]This one says the CCO of off-brand calls hype chats.
[04:55.05]What?
[05:02.03]So I've said my thing.
[05:03.55]I'm not going to click on any of these.
[05:06.07]I'm sorry, but like maybe I don't know.
[05:11.40]Let's just go through today and I'll figure out if I want to keep that or not.
[05:27.33]okay okay streamers you can't tell how much they're really spending yeah some of them are just different currencies I feel like I'm I feel like I'm like forex trading in my chat room like a canadian and then we have um we have like English pounds and we all I feel like I'm trading up here like forex

[06:52.06]Hold on.
[06:53.42]You cannot opt out of hype chat as we wanted to, but you can set a minimum...
[07:00.13]You can set it a minimum of a hundred dollars.
[07:06.09]Okay.
[07:10.80]Well, I'm just going to leave it as, but you know, make it like, I don't know.

[07:29.52]Set it at like a billion dollars so nobody can do it.
[07:36.24]You must read them.
[07:37.78]No.

[07:53.71]It's alright.
[07:54.03]I appreciate it nonetheless, but I ain't reading all that.
[07:57.67]Alright, there you go.
[08:02.81]If we need to make it a little higher so it's not spammed, we will.
[08:06.01]But it's a new feature, I guess.
[08:07.49]Cool.
[08:07.77]Okay.
[08:08.45]Anyways, Final Fantasy XVI.
[08:11.85]Wow.
[08:12.35]Wowee.
[08:13.41]Here it is.
[08:18.39]Get to pick up right where we left off in the demo.
[08:25.34]I'm excited.
[08:26.38]I cannot wait to hear that battle music like a thousand more times.
[08:33.13]Yes, it is an ad.
[08:34.15]This is hashtag ad.
[08:35.31]This is sponsored by Square Enix.
[08:38.11]Keep that in mind.
[08:41.11]But I'm having a blast in the demo.
[08:46.44]Seems like I'm, I don't know.
[08:49.14]I think this is going to be pretty gosh darn fun.
[08:52.64]Alright, you guys ready?
[08:54.38]Let's go.
[08:57.25]You get a face game if you're good.
[08:59.83]You'll get a face game if you're good.
[09:01.09]Only if you're good.
[09:01.59]Alright, so it's probably this one here.
[09:09.52]What about the Super Mario RPG remake?
[09:16.04]Huh?
[09:17.90]What are you talking about?
[09:21.48]What are you talking about?
[09:24.63]He's making stuff up.
[09:28.58]It's real.
[09:34.63]I like when people make up.
[09:38.63]It's real.
[09:42.73]No, that's cool.
[09:43.81]I'm glad they didn't just port it.
[09:47.31]I'm excited.
[09:48.03]Hopefully it's really good.
[09:49.80]I'm looking forward to it.
[09:52.50]I mean, I feel like collectively, everybody that has that in their top 10 favorite games of all time
[09:57.76]I think everybody just kind of had a sigh of relief when they did that first little intro when it was like, okay, this is a port.
[10:06.99]And then they did the, wait a minute, here comes the magical star that's flying over and turning everything to 3D.
[10:12.13]I think everyone was like, oh, okay.
[10:13.89]Oh, okay.
[10:14.89]This is real.
[10:19.70]But yeah.
[10:22.58]I would be lying to you if I didn't tell you I was not excited for that because it seems cool.
[10:27.82]Alright, ready?
[10:29.00]I am excited.
[10:29.80]If you don't know the story of Final Fantasy 16, you probably have to go watch the VOD.
[10:36.24]But the game is officially out.
[10:37.54]It's out right now.
[10:38.52]It launched today.
[10:39.84]PlayStation 5.
[10:42.32]Let's freaking go.
[10:44.57]Additional content is now available for redemption.
[10:46.31]These items can be claimed from the system tab.
[10:48.19]Alright, let's do it.
[10:53.27]This should pick up right where the demo left off.
[11:07.25]Yeah, it'll pick up 13 years after the demo.
[11:12.65]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11:15.95]Is it correct?
[11:19.03]Welcome back.
[11:21.45]Sorry.
[11:22.97]What's our situation?
[11:26.04]Let's just say Shiva and Titan's little spat hasn't made things any easier.
[11:33.00]Lord check.
[11:33.62]No wait.
[11:35.32]Good call.
[11:36.26]Let's just get a quick little rundown.
[11:45.86]Wait, what?
[11:49.10]Logic.
[11:52.59]Wyvern.
[11:53.47]Oh, that's right.
[11:54.15]Okay.
[11:54.31]Alright.
[11:54.61]I remember.
[11:54.97]I remember.
[11:55.63]Yes.
[11:56.01]Yes.
[11:56.23]But at the very end, we were a soldier now.
[11:59.09]Alright.
[11:59.31]Yep.
[11:59.47]Yep.
[11:59.63]Yep.
[11:59.87]Yep.
[12:00.03]Okay.
[12:00.27]Alright.
[12:00.69]Good thing this exists.
[12:01.79]I swear.
[12:02.17]I'm telling you.
[12:04.16]Slave soldier for the Holy Empire of Sambrique, now in his 13th year of servitude.
[12:09.99]Drafted as a frontline infantryman, the magical might, granted him by the blessing of the phoenix, quickly saw him promoted to an elite squadron of assassins.
[12:18.03]He was assigned the moniker by which he is now known.
[12:21.46]Interesting.
[12:22.14]Okay.
[12:23.50]I am really glad this exists because I was going to just ask, why the fuck is this guy's name not Clive?
[12:30.70]It's like, what happened?
[12:32.10]Alright.
[12:38.05]The bastards.
[12:38.79]Okay.
[12:40.93]A unit of Imperial Army assassins tasked with taking the head of the Iron Kingdom's dominant, Warden of Ice and Vessel of the Icon, Shiva.
[12:48.08]Got it.
[12:48.24]Let's go.
[13:01.21]And?
[13:02.11]It's as you thought.
[13:03.09]The Crusaders have sounded the retreat.
[13:06.55]Then we follow.
[13:09.40]You need to change your title?
[13:10.52]This is a misleading title right now?
[13:34.59]No, it's not.
[13:35.55]No, it's not.
[13:36.43]When I get control.
[13:37.31]I tweeted that too.
[13:39.31]Go.
[13:39.45]Alright.
[13:39.99]A chance encounter.
[13:58.07]The iconic abilities Scarlet Cyclone and Heat Wave for the Phoenix are now available for acquisition and upgrade on the abilities tab in the main menu.
[14:06.39]Do not forget that once acquired, new abilities must be equipped on the gear and icons tab.
[14:11.39]How do they expect us to kill something that can do this?
[14:14.31]They don't.
[14:15.84]Only the girl holding its leash.
[14:20.42]They announced it's not misleading anymore.
[14:28.14]I have to make sure my tweet and my title make sense.
[14:32.46]This... Uh, should I keep the... Um... This... Control scheme?
[14:45.19]I feel like if it now is the time to learn how to do the other one or go to the, um... What is it, uh... Type B, right?
[15:02.98]What sprint?
[15:03.46]This is a sprint, right?
[15:09.98]Do type B. It's going to be way better in the long run.
[15:14.35]Uh-huh.
[15:22.95]So I want to do type B. It is on type B. Okay.
[15:27.33]Okay.
[15:30.88]Alright, so this is Circle is Evade.
[15:33.68]It's going to take a little bit of extra getting used to because I did the tutorial with Type A. So it might take me a little bit to get used to it.
[15:43.14]But it's probably better, like you said, in the long run.
[15:51.09]We have a face game.
[15:51.75]We've been good.
[15:53.51]Not yet.
[15:56.31]What is Sprint or Run?
[15:57.95]I could lock on as L1.
[16:01.12]Cycle icons is triangle.
[16:04.44]R2 is magic on this one.
[16:06.22]Square is ready iconic ability.
[16:08.44]Okay.
[16:14.06]No face cam?
[16:15.34]You have to wait.
[16:17.86]I'm waiting for your birthday.
[16:26.48]Your birthday's in like 20 minutes.
[16:31.79]Your birthday is in 20 minutes, okay?
[16:42.29]What's your iconic ability?
[16:44.90]Being able to go like this.
[16:50.30]For a long time and hold the note.
[16:51.74]Titan has knocked the fight out of our Ironblood friends.
[16:55.06]Where are the rest of them?
[16:57.08]That can't be the main host.
[16:59.24]Wait.
[17:05.48]Our fortunes have turned, Sergeant.
[17:08.35]It's her, the dominant.
[17:10.65]Are you certain?
[17:11.69]The Crystalline Orthodox is a backwards faith for a backwards people.
[17:16.71]In the Iron Kingdom, they teach that dominance are unclean aberrations born of blackest sin.
[17:23.29]Only their priests are allowed to perform the rites of priming.
[17:27.01]And I see many.
[17:28.37]Change it live to Wyvern if you want in the title.
[17:35.90]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[17:38.86]Trace cut!
[17:41.79]Let's go.
[17:49.79]Uh oh.
[17:53.57]Holy shit.
[17:54.29]Nobody messes with the bastards.
[18:14.82]Fight Alvation now, King.
[18:16.92]Alad Scully, he asked.
[18:30.97]Let this be the end.
[18:36.76]Wait, what?
[18:37.46]Wait, what?
[18:39.66]Should've done a lore check.
[18:48.00]Alright, I gotta get the controls down.
[18:58.77]So there's like a parry.
[18:59.85]There's a parry, there's a... Okay, that's the magic.
[19:07.04]magic is if I want to do the sorry I am I am hyping up right now okay so that's if you want to do the combo
[19:25.80]And then holding instead of it's square and then... What button is that?
[19:31.34]Is it up?
[19:32.62]What button is that?
[19:33.22]Okay, that's R2.
[19:35.12]And that's R1.
[19:37.83]Alright.
[19:41.61]How do I do this Phoenix Shift when it comes to the new control scheme?
[19:47.07]Lock on?
[19:48.17]What?
[19:48.33]Oh, okay.
[19:49.81]L2 is Phoenix Shift.
[19:51.74]Alright, got it.
[19:52.96]Ooh!
[19:54.98]Shit!
[19:58.82]What did that say?
[20:02.98]What did that say?
[20:12.75]What?
[20:14.25]Why did that happen?
[20:19.49]Like they're having an auto update?
[20:21.62]Whatever.
[20:25.56]I'm gonna get like text from mom up there apparently.
[20:30.75]Alright, I gotta learn how to get my controls back.
[20:33.79]I got a whole new control scheme.
[20:36.99]Alright.
[20:40.55]You know what?
[20:40.93]You know what?
[20:42.47]I think I'm going back.
[20:43.77]I think I'm going back.
[20:44.49]I got used to it.
[20:45.95]I'm going back.
[20:50.88]Yeah, I'm going back.
[20:56.45]I know everyone's like, no, no, no, no, but I got used to it in the demo and I got to use it.
[21:24.21]Orders, Sergeant!
[21:25.09]Stop gawking and move!
[21:33.02]Fucking Icon!
[21:35.16]Icon?
[21:36.14]She's not even fully primed!
[21:58.97]Alright, it's square and triangle, square and triangle.
[22:02.37]I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[22:03.51]It's just a good warm-up, it's a good warm-up.
[22:24.70]Do I have enough heals?
[22:25.92]Yeah, I'm good.
[22:39.35]Oh shit.
[22:42.79]Alright, we're good.
[22:53.95]Okay.
[22:55.99]I went to type A, then I went to type B, and I went back, and I went forward.
[22:59.05]I got it, I got it.
[23:00.05]I'll figure it out quick.
[23:04.86]Can you dodge roll?
[23:06.44]It is a dodge.
[23:07.92]Okay, frozen tear.
[23:09.50]Crafting.
[23:11.42]Very nice.
[23:14.44]I probably should lower check.
[23:24.43]Moves are cool.
[23:25.11]They are.
[23:25.41]I want to look at the upgrade tree.
[23:34.06]Is she dead?
[23:35.68]I don't think so.
[23:37.50]Well?
[23:38.96]What are you waiting for?
[23:47.42]Oh, we... Okay, we don't need a lore check.
[23:48.68]I know.
[23:53.96]No.
[23:54.92]No, that's... Not you.
[23:58.50]Not here.
[24:02.00]I'll bloody do it then.
[24:09.18]Jesus.
[24:14.52]Fuck.
[24:25.26]We've got company Wyvern.
[24:31.70]You've dodged that?
[24:32.46]Yeah.
[24:32.72]100%.
[24:33.62]What the hell are you doing?
[24:36.90]Lord Ohilda Vibra!
[24:39.94]Get your ass over here and help me with these bastards.
[24:43.23]We're the bastards.
[24:45.53]Which ones do you mean?
[24:46.47]I'm sorry, Jill.
[24:55.11]Alright, let's go.
[25:06.18]What is wrong with you, Wyvern?
[25:11.54]Alright, it's L1 is locked on.
[25:21.23]Yep, there we go.
[25:21.95]That's what I'm looking for.
[25:29.92]Is there a better way to kind of flick between?
[25:34.24]Okay, it's Brightstick.
[25:41.07]Let me get the dodge down again.
[25:46.59]That was my kill.
[25:50.83]Now that that's done... I won't ask you again, Wyvern.
[25:57.48]Take her head so we can be done with this.
[26:03.06]I... I can't.
[26:05.86]I won't.
[26:09.38]Would betray the Holy Empire?
[26:12.24]Betray?
[26:12.74]I don't recall ever pledging allegiance to your Emperor.
[26:16.93]My service may have been bought with this brand, but not my loyalty.
[26:21.75]I just fight to survive.
[26:25.55]Really?
[26:25.92]We have to fight you?
[26:28.68]Are you dead?
[26:30.58]Wait, what is going on?
[26:32.30]Alright, I gotta play now.
[26:36.21]I gotta play.
[27:03.46]You're not gonna hit me.
[27:04.12]You'll never hit me.
[27:18.45]Top it off.
[27:23.24]Did he get tired after swinging that many times?
[27:28.89]Have you forgotten who plucked you from the front lines?
[27:32.12]Who trained you?
[27:33.84]Who gave you a name when you had none?
[27:37.68]You speak as if we don't bear the same brand, son.
[27:41.78]I've always had a name, and I've not forgotten it.
[27:44.08]In my name, it's Clive.
[27:46.65]The past like a torn blanket.
[27:49.35]Then you will die as you should have 13 years ago.
[28:14.93]I'll do nothing.
[28:18.45]No one.
[28:19.82]And I will not fall by your hand.
[28:25.08]I'll take your head.
[28:27.10]Too slow.
[28:42.76]This is fucking fun.
[28:56.95]Cool.
[28:59.73]Alright.
[29:07.34]See, I got it.
[29:08.78]Need to take advantage of self.
[29:11.24]Level up.
[29:11.80]Nice.
[29:16.69]Alright, you've been good.
[29:18.35]You've been good.
[29:18.75]I'll turn it on.
[29:21.51]You've been good.
[29:22.07]Although I didn't need to do this.
[29:26.10]Ooh.
[29:27.92]The whole crafting system.
[29:29.36]Actually, let me turn this off for a sec.
[29:32.02]That's it.
[29:44.25]Your mom did a nice job with your hair today.
[29:47.79]Okay.
[29:49.03]Okay, dude.
[30:13.54]shit damn this constant conflict
[30:50.27]And.
[30:50.45]Dog.
[30:53.64]This way.
[30:54.38]Bloody wind.
[30:55.88]Well, come on then.
[31:25.03]We need a lore check?
[31:27.09]We actually kind of do.
[31:28.55]Alright, this is great because we actually really need this.
[31:32.13]Let me... I need to do something very quickly.
[31:35.01]Give me one second.
[31:37.17]I need to... Okay, that's actually alright.
[31:43.04]Oh, there we go.
[31:43.46]Just want to make sure that looks alright.
[31:47.48]I need to make sure my webcam is delayed a little.
[31:53.18]Because it will not be synced up with the game.
[31:58.16]Now it should be.
[31:59.86]Hi.
[32:00.44]Hi there.
[32:02.22]Where's a good place for the camera?
[32:03.24]Like up here?
[32:03.62]I'll just give you a tiny camera.
[32:08.09]And by the way, it's going off.
[32:10.67]Unless you're good.
[32:17.77]right so we got let's see right dominant shiva and clive's childhood friend in the depths of the nysa defile the two came to blows at the orders of the armies that enslaved them okay that should be good too much delay is too much really shouldn't be should match up pretty well
[32:46.51]That's not... That's bad.
[32:48.37]It's really badly desynced.
[32:49.42]Wait, what?
[32:49.72]It really shouldn't be.
[32:57.70]It's not even close.
[32:58.70]How about now?
[33:00.44]If I go like this.
[33:04.18]How about now?
[33:09.45]No?
[33:10.63]It's by like 500 milliseconds.
[33:14.81]Well, face cam's going off.
[33:25.24]Okay, I remember this.
[33:27.28]Holy Empire.
[33:28.04]Tiamat is the leader of the elite assassin squadron to which Wyvern is assigned.
[33:33.55]The bastards.
[33:36.93]Uh-huh.
[33:41.27]I'll figure it out at the break.
[33:43.01]Or in like 10 minutes.
[33:43.75]I don't know.
[33:44.09]Just hang out.
[33:45.13]Just chill.
[33:45.53]I'll fix it.
[33:49.29]Okay.
[33:50.13]And this is Branded Soldier.
[33:51.63]Alright.
[34:25.38]Hugo dear... My proud desert lion... With that you had taken care when chasing the hare...
[34:35.04]I expected more from the mighty Titan.
[34:43.10]You put the Ice Queen on our back, no doubt.
[34:53.01]But you'll have to work harder if you're to claim this price.
[35:02.63]Cool, cool, cool, cool.
[35:04.53]Alright.
[35:27.38]Yeah, because I have to delay my microphone by 800 milliseconds to go with the capture of the PlayStation 5.
[35:35.23]So I have to delay my webcam by 800 milliseconds, but apparently that's not matching up.
[35:50.81]Why is your setup so bad?
[35:55.32]It's fine.
[35:58.50]And who's this fine hound I see before me?
[36:03.13]A fine hound who shaped your life, that's who.
[36:10.39]Torgul.
[36:11.97]Aye?
[36:13.35]His name is Torgul.
[36:16.67]You two acquainted?
[36:18.85]Well then, you won't mind taking him off my hands?
[36:25.23]Funny.
[36:26.67]I'd always pictured you as more of the Chocobo type.
[36:31.74]Clive Rosfield.
[36:33.16]Can you do this voice?
[36:35.42]No.
[36:38.38]Come now.
[36:39.48]Fleet as flame, fierce as a wildfire.
[36:42.74]That there was the blessing of the Phoenix.
[36:47.20]I'd heard rumors that you'd survived.
[36:49.94]But I never paid them much heed.
[36:53.44]You could definitely do it with filters.
[36:56.35]And if I drop my pitch down... Back her up.
[37:24.39]Who's that?
[37:27.03]Not another step.
[37:30.79]I mean it.
[37:36.25]Well, I'm not about to leave her here.
[37:38.52]Not one with a warm bed waiting.
[37:41.52]It's alright.
[37:48.22]You're welcome to join us.
[37:50.34]You do want to help her, don't you?
[37:53.38]Lord check we know who these people are said if we aren't back so none of our heads I'll explain everything once we're back at the hideaway come on We'll get some more introductions
[38:29.74]You should lore check your microphone, see if the delay didn't get fixed.
[38:41.50]Okay, cool.
[38:47.54]The Hideaway.
[39:00.83]Don't worry, I will lore check a million more times.
[39:03.22]Not much further now.
[39:12.78]But we're in the middle of the Deadlands.
[39:15.45]Keen eye, you.
[39:17.93]The blights suck this place dry.
[39:19.67]Meaning no trees, no birds, and no magic.
[39:24.41]But it also means no neighbors.
[39:28.66]The last place anyone would think to lurk.
[39:37.64]That was weird.
[39:38.40]What just happened in the corner?
[39:42.86]Are we... Are we good?
[39:46.16]One, two, three, four.
[39:54.97]What are you hearing first?
[39:57.25]Do you hear me and then my movements or do you see movements then hear me?
[40:00.95]It's very important.
[40:06.47]Your audio is coming in a second or two before I move.
[40:09.86]Okay, then let's fix it.
[40:28.18]This place.
[40:29.80]These are fallen ruins.
[40:31.30]This better?
[40:32.14]Two.
[40:32.52]One.
[40:32.70]Two.
[40:32.90]And it keeps the black from our lungs.
[40:35.90]But how do you survive without magic?
[40:39.38]How does anyone?
[40:40.92]Hard work and a bit of mouth.
[40:43.61]You must be starving.
[40:45.21]We grow them here.
[40:46.63]Believe it or not.
[40:49.25]Suit yourself.
[40:55.22]It's a little bit of a big bite of an apple.
[40:57.48]This is funny.
[40:58.02]This is the dominant.
[40:59.98]How cold since we found her?
[41:01.70]I was hoping you might give her a look over.
[41:05.33]Alright.
[41:06.83]Goots, get her upstairs.
[41:09.79]But none will... Don't fret about Karen.
[41:13.37]I've taken care of her feet.
[41:15.11]All of it.
[41:16.41]She's the best healer this side of the belt.
[41:18.43]You have nothing to worry about.
[41:23.71]Sid, do you ever think about getting into voice work?
[41:26.68]You should probably... Sid, do you ever think about reading some of the plays that we have in front of an audience?
[41:35.70]Okay.
[41:36.34]Hide, hideaway.
[41:39.98]Alright, let's look at a map.
[41:41.34]Detail map of your current area.
[41:42.52]Main scenario destinations are marked with that.
[41:45.16]That's a map.
[41:47.09]Cool.
[41:50.35]I know exactly where I need to go.
[41:52.98]Oh, I can just mark it, too.
[41:56.85]How we doing?
[41:57.19]We alright?
[41:58.15]One, two, three.
[42:00.49]Better?
[42:06.71]Perfect?
[42:08.19]Yeah, alright.
[42:12.05]You reckon he's a soldier, then?
[42:13.41]I'd be surprised if he wasn't.
[42:18.35]Still hungry, are you?
[42:21.50]Blacksmith?
[42:45.78]That is not perfect.
[42:46.92]Uh, I'll get it better.
[42:50.72]is it still are you hearing it still or is it um are you hearing me first and then my face moving or how's it how bad is it it's fine that's fine just working on a pet project of mine though she's not about biting the hand that feeds her
[43:19.25]Alright.
[43:20.29]I was hoping we might try and solve the mystery of poor Clive Rossfield.
[43:25.31]A bearer of the Sanbrecqua Imperial Army sent behind enemy lines.
[43:30.72]With orders to wait until it turned into a brawl, then slit the Dominant's throat in the chaos.
[43:37.92]I didn't know it was her.
[43:41.04]How could it be?
[43:43.23]And so, to save her neck, you slit your sergeant's, then set your sights on the hills.
[43:49.56]Conveniently forgetting how the Empire deals with deserters.
[43:53.40]Because with that on your chop, my friend, we both know you won't be getting far.
[43:59.82]Without you, I mean, you're going to help me, though.
[44:01.94]Of course.
[44:05.94]You've fallen a long way, Lord Rossfield.
[44:08.42]You look like a pickle today.
[44:11.23]It's fine.
[44:28.64]I want candles like that.
[44:59.16]And it's also why we need help.
[45:01.96]From Brandy who know one end of a sword from the other.
[45:07.17]What say you, Clive?
[45:09.61]Will you join us?
[45:23.18]Sid, was it?
[45:26.44]I trust that you'll do right by Jill.
[45:31.05]But until my brother is avenged, I must walk my own path.
[45:35.19]Avenged.
[45:40.20]Are you typing?
[45:41.66]I'm watching.
[45:43.56]I'm asking a quick question.
[45:47.13]Phoenix's evil twin.
[45:48.21]Well, Bobby May, another rumor proven true.
[45:53.68]I only stand here today because of Joshua.
[45:57.52]Thirteen years I've waited for this chance.
[46:00.76]I've slept in filth, drunk from a gutter, killed more men than I can count.
[46:07.21]You're right.
[46:08.97]The Empire will not suffer a deserter.
[46:12.73]This will be my best opportunity.
[46:17.20]My last.
[46:20.27]Which is why you should join us.
[46:23.29]I told you I'm not... Interested, I know.
[46:30.43]One of my scouts sent word there's a group of branded fugitives north of here, in the imperial village of Lostwing.
[46:37.46]Among them is one he believes to be a dominant of fire.
[46:44.56]Is he certain?
[46:48.65]What say we go and ask him?
[46:54.75]This doesn't mean I'm joining you.
[47:06.04]Let's make ready then.
[47:10.92]You'll find everything you need down in the main hall, as well as a few things you don't.
[47:15.30]SIDS solar.
[47:24.16]Visit the main hall.
[47:26.76]I wonder, should I like buy anything?
[47:30.75]How much money do I even have?
[47:32.41]Your hair looks red.
[47:49.57]This is the full game.
[47:50.09]Full game came out today.
[47:52.57]We picked up at the end of the demo.
[47:53.78]On PS5.
[47:54.68]Do we actually get to upgrade stuff?
[48:17.03]It looks like your room is upside down.
[48:19.25]What are you talking about?
[48:21.53]My room is not upside down.
[48:45.29]Why would I even need to address that?
[48:47.87]Of course, I'm sitting here.
[48:49.89]Like, imagine defending that, no, I am not, in fact, upside down.
[48:53.44]How do you even argue that?
[48:54.88]Okay.
[49:13.65]Awesome spirit.
[49:14.81]Better suited to stripping oil from a painter's canvas than consumption.
[49:18.37]Grants overworked conscripts a few rare moments of sweet oblivion on their long, arduous sea journeys north from the continent.
[49:26.90]Okay.
[49:28.94]Here, take this.
[49:31.26]Do you want that or not?
[49:33.98]I can take it back.
[49:36.27]No.
[49:37.93]Damn you, goots.
[49:41.27]Alright, alright.
[49:42.75]No need to be hasty.
[49:45.79]Let's have a look at you.
[49:52.84]Drop something.
[49:56.44]Everybody just seriously thinks that I'm upside down.
[49:58.61]I'm going to let this go.
[49:59.41]I'll do what I can as a favor to Goot's mind.
[50:13.08]We could barely see that.
[50:14.22]It's hard when you're in a little cube over here, over like there.
[50:18.22]I have to match it up that way.
[50:20.16]Okay.
[50:21.28]The crafting of new gear as well as the upgrading of existing gear can be done at a blacksmith.
[50:28.49]As long as you have the recipe and the proper materials, select a highlighted item from the list and hold X to craft or upgrade.
[50:34.91]Looks like I can upgrade my iron belt.
[50:47.29]okay okay fine I'll stop vibing I'll stop vibing then fine okay iron belt I can also read there's nothing really sorry I could do okay it just it wants me to do it so and the belt caesar square you want anything else you bring your own materials I'll bear that in mind thank you

[52:21.72]I'm wearing the Broadsword right now.
[52:24.34]Browser plus one.
[52:26.78]No, I actually don't.
[52:27.53]What do I have right now?
[52:28.89]Why?
[52:29.17]Why did I do this with my voice?
[52:30.15]Alright, I can.
[52:32.61]Should I make some bracers?
[52:46.80]I could.
[52:47.06]Why not?
[52:48.42]Oh, this uses a wire ride.

[59:58.14]I need supplies for my journey to Lostwing.
[60:01.04]I'm talking.
[60:01.66]What's that?
[60:04.72]Does the newcomer think it proper to make demands of a poor old matron before even introducing himself?
[60:12.80]It's Clive.
[60:13.80]M&Ms are gross?
[60:16.05]M&Ms are gross by themselves.
[60:17.85]They're amazing in other baked goods or ice cream.
[60:21.31]I've seen to it that his chin's rubbed and his belly fed.
[60:25.31]Though I suppose that's your job now.
[60:28.37]M&M's and cookies?
[60:29.45]S tier.
[60:30.10]M&M's and ice cream?
[60:30.90]S tier.
[60:31.24]Handful of M&M's?
[60:32.34]C. C plus, maybe.
[60:32.84]Alright.
[61:00.66]Shop stock changes as the story progresses, so be sure to check frequently.
[61:04.86]So I can buy a broad... Wait, I can buy a broadsword?
[61:07.82]I'm gonna buy a broadsword, then I'm gonna take it over and upgrade the broadsword.
[61:10.47]How many I have for... I'll get another one of these.
[61:16.89]Wait, how much?
[61:17.39]That's 200!
[61:20.77]It's 500 bucks for the broadsword, and it's 200 for a potion?! !
[61:28.77]Seems like a lot.
[61:29.87]Alright.
[61:30.95]I'm getting the broadsword.
[61:36.18]Yeah.
[61:36.50]I'm going to go upgrade it.
[61:37.26]Just don't get hit.
[61:39.78]I'll be fine.
[61:43.60]Just don't get hit.
[61:44.24]You're taking his side now.
[61:57.83]And after all I've done for you.
[62:02.21]Alright.
[62:04.41]Alright, I can make an exception.
[62:09.09]But just this once, mind.
[62:11.58]My stores are getting cluttered and I need to make room for the next shipment.
[62:17.58]You're broke now?
[62:21.30]Thank me?
[62:23.82]Thank your dog.
[62:25.52]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[62:29.55]What button do I press to get off camera?
[62:31.16]That one.
[62:31.40]Alright, collect the supplies.
[62:47.52]Wait, did I just buy a broadsword for no reason?
[62:49.82]I swear to God, there's a broadsword in one of these sacks.
[62:54.82]I'm gonna be pissed off.
[63:05.08]Virtual Battlescape provides Clive a safe location to test out new abilities and train against all manner of enemies.
[63:12.36]Oh, it's like a little training zone.
[63:14.35]All of virtue.
[63:17.33]That's cool.
[63:18.83]I guess it wants me to do it.
[63:21.03]Do I?
[63:21.73]Yeah, I guess it's like, go do it.
[63:30.00]I'm telling you, I'm going to be the guy that has the big hump on the official source of this music.
[63:39.41]I'll be the bump on YouTube, you know what I mean?
[63:46.29]Okay.
[63:50.80]Ooh, wait, you can see what I do over here.
[63:52.76]That's kind of, I don't like, that's weird.
[63:54.72]You guys are going to judge my movements.
[64:01.07]The YouTube video hump.
[64:02.23]That's what I'm talking about.
[64:04.09]The thing that says the most replayed part of the video.
[64:06.58]I'm going to contribute to that.
[64:07.60]Is it going to be bad?
[64:29.34]Why does he move so weird?
[64:30.52]I'm just fucking around.
[64:31.97]Alright, this is really cool.
[64:36.33]So I can do invincibility.
[64:38.07]I can do an action log.
[64:39.17]I can do enemy invincibility.
[64:42.06]I can probably change the target.
[64:43.56]Yeah, alright.
[64:44.18]That's cool.
[64:47.60]So I can... Oh, you can practice against bosses?
[64:50.37]Is that how that works?
[65:05.55]though not attacking currently oh enemy aggro here we go interesting it's a good place practice dodging
[65:34.88]Alright, cool.
[65:38.05]I might practice here with some encounters.
[65:52.55]This person really wants me to know that they ate a bunch of bread.
[66:00.77]Hmm.
[66:02.69]leaving already are you it's you I'll miss the most lady Karen it always is don't stop you going does it this should be fun right when's the blt stream soon
[66:35.49]There's fast travel.
[66:36.63]Use the world map.
[66:37.51]Instant travel between unlocked locations.
[66:40.85]New locations are unlocked by progressing through the main story or discovering waymarks known as obelisks.
[66:46.96]Cool.
[66:48.84]World map up and automatically upon leaving an area.
[66:51.94]That was a weird way to say that.
[66:52.96]Alright.
[66:55.62]Collect the supplies, which were right here.
[66:59.01]Come on, get us off.
[67:01.01]Clear this.
[67:01.79]There we go.
[67:05.41]Make for the Greatwood.
[67:13.19]Oh, world map.
[67:14.43]There it is.
[67:15.05]Which button is that?
[67:15.61]Ah.
[67:23.09]Okay.
[67:24.85]We're going over here.
[67:25.71]The Great Wood.
[67:27.19]So deep and vast is the Great Wood, it serves as a defensive barrier between the Crystal Belt and the Holy Empire.
[67:32.01]Are you going to finish the game?
[67:36.69]I, streaming-wise, if you guys continue to like it, I mean, I'm invested.
[67:42.85]I might finish it on my own time, like just kind of hanging out on the couch, or maybe I'll play it here.
[67:47.03]I don't know.
[67:47.39]We'll see.
[67:47.73]We'll see how you guys feel.
[67:49.25]Because I'm into it.
[67:51.63]Bastard blood flies everywhere.
[67:55.41]I told you we should have taken the Crystal Road.
[67:57.03]And I told you that we're outlaws.
[68:03.39]You want every bounty hunter in Storm harrying us from here... to the Holy Capital.
[68:10.54]Besides, what's wrong with a shortcut through nature's splendor?
[68:15.48]The Deadlands claim more of the realm each day.
[68:19.09]That a place like this still exists is a miracle in itself.
[68:21.40]When are you going to do a live audience stream so we can throw tomatoes at you?
[68:25.08]We'll be back in Imperial land soon.
[68:28.82]You alright?
[68:30.72]Never better.
[68:32.84]Sounds like it.
[68:33.96]Here we go, so here's the party.
[68:38.43]Let's go.
[68:40.97]That there is a fine hound.
[68:43.31]Soon took to hunting.
[68:44.65]Fearless as you like.
[68:46.77]It's good to have you back, Toggle.
[68:50.51]That's always huge.
[68:54.67]Okay.
[68:58.71]Banning Embers.
[69:03.46]Torgul has joined the party and will fight alongside Clive.
[69:07.68]So use the D-pad to talk between item shortcuts and pet commands.
[69:14.74]Attack.
[69:15.85]heal and launch an enemy into the air oh so I gotta go boom and then up the accessory known as the ring of timely assistance removes the need for giving torgal commands when this item is equipped torgal will attack and heal automatically based on the current battle situation did I mention there'd be deadly beasts I don't even put that on there'll be deadly beasts
[69:40.56]Not that a trained assassin can't handle one.
[69:43.16]How reassuring.
[69:45.20]You're welcome.
[69:46.48]For that and the shortcut.
[70:02.64]Can you walk?
[70:04.20]Walk, walk.
[70:05.42]I'm walking.
[70:20.50]I don't think so.
[70:32.23]I thought he was on the ground.
[70:33.59]I was like, oh shit, Sin's like dead.
[70:45.80]Where is Torvald?
[70:46.36]Oh, he's already up there.
[70:58.65]I want to upgrade this.
[71:03.03]I like the magic.
[71:07.00]Is this for a sponsorship?
[71:07.84]This is.
[71:09.66]This stream is sponsored by Square Enix.
[71:15.92]Final Fantasy 16.
[71:16.36]What do you think of the PS5?
[71:27.28]It's... So I use consoles as like a complete multimedia box.
[71:35.73]And PS5 seems pretty great for... Hold on a minute.
[71:40.05]Wait a minute.
[71:41.21]He hates it.
[71:41.95]I just... Oh, I'm about to explain to you why I like it so much.
[71:48.85]I didn't even get to say two sentences.
[71:50.45]What in good Gregor's name is he doing this far south?
[71:55.45]Looking for food.
[71:56.77]No more wolves where he's from.
[71:58.43]The north was one of the first parts of Storm to fall to the Blight.
[72:04.33]Poor sod.
[72:05.71]I'd invite him over for a cup of tea if I didn't think he'd eat the dog.
[72:11.39]Whoa.
[72:16.25]You said on August 2nd, there'd be a bald cam for your birthday.
[72:19.59]I'll just put my head down and you can laugh for five seconds.
[72:22.26]Let's try and stay out of its path.
[72:24.58]Okay, stay away from that.
[72:33.66]Oh, shit.
[72:34.54]Remember when I said there'd be deadly beasts?
[72:36.53]Well, the shrubs of these paths aren't much worse.
[72:39.27]I knew everything too much just now.
[72:53.52]Oh, I have the charge move too, don't I?
[72:59.53]This one here.
[73:03.89]Here we go.
[73:04.19]Ooh.
[73:04.35]Level up.
[73:18.49]11 Gil.
[73:19.15]Is it Gil or Jill?
[73:21.07]Gil?
[73:31.14]Oh, I got Wyrite.
[73:32.40]Maybe that's enough to upgrade the broadsword.
[73:34.60]Do I even have the broadsword?
[73:35.56]I have it equipped, right?
[73:36.26]Yeah.
[73:43.88]It's strong.
[73:46.10]Thank you kindly.
[73:55.94]Like the gill.
[74:03.62]The ruins.
[74:04.22]They're everywhere, aren't they?
[74:12.85]Some say there was a time they blocked out the stars.
[74:16.75]Down was the only way left for them to go.
[74:18.65]Why not have the browser equipped?
[74:20.41]There's probably a lesson to be learned from that.
[74:23.25]But it can wait.
[74:24.45]Come on.
[74:26.02]I'll check.
[74:26.92]Actually, I have points to spend too in the abilities.
[74:38.89]What do I want to focus on?
[74:42.19]Journal tab is information.
[74:43.45]Yep.
[74:43.56]Alright.
[74:44.38]But I want to see items.
[74:51.18]You can assign shortcuts.
[74:52.92]Uh-huh.
[74:54.84]think the shortcuts are fine what is wait I want the strength one I think attack increases attack fire by ten percent yeah let's put this down here just don't get hit and just do more damage that sounds good to me alright gear and icons
[75:21.50]You have these.
[75:22.16]I don't think I unlocked anything new.
[75:23.50]No.
[75:23.76]Alright, abilities.
[75:24.54]Here we go.
[75:25.04]Alright, what do we got?
[75:26.56]415?
[75:34.06]Should I upgrade Scarlet Cyclone or should I just... Probably should get all these first.
[75:38.48]Magic Burst?
[75:39.26]Ooh, actually I use this all the time.
[75:41.46]I use this all the time.
[75:46.36]This is my move.
[75:52.07]It's either that or... I'm doing it.
[75:58.16]This is my move.
[76:00.02]You see me do it a lot.
[76:02.42]Alright, now I'm gonna... I'll get this.
[76:05.27]Put this while in the air to slice down.
[76:08.11]Cool.
[76:12.97]Taunt?
[76:15.65]R2 plus that button to pull an enemy?
[76:21.82]Swift recovery.
[76:23.38]That's important.
[76:28.64]Stomp.
[76:30.90]Kick off a nearby enemy.
[76:31.92]Increasing jump height.
[76:33.10]Yeah.
[76:33.40]I mean, just all the cheap ones.
[76:34.70]I'll just get them all.
[76:39.91]Okay.
[76:40.21]Go.
[76:44.11]Do you believe in dolphins?
[76:46.83]Do you mean, do I believe that the animal, the dolphins, exist?
[76:49.85]Or do I believe that the dolphins will win the Super Bowl eventually?
[76:53.01]What do you mean?
[76:54.71]Do I believe in the dolphins, or do I believe that a dolphin as an animal exists?
[77:01.08]I feel like you mean, like, do I believe in the dolphins, like the football team?
[77:08.78]Which, not a great season last year.
[77:11.31]Not a good season last year.
[77:16.66]What did they do?
[77:17.39]Fuckin'... What was their record last year?
[77:22.09]Dolphins did... Like, they were alright last year.
[77:28.18]9-8?
[77:32.42]Could get a little better.
[77:48.51]Dragon?
[77:50.59]Wait, wasn't that my name?
[78:05.08]I'll hit you with a precision dodge all day.
[78:20.74]I'm gonna hit you with, I'm gonna hit you with precision every day.
[78:47.58]Yeah.
[79:00.29]Dude, Jerma is so precise.
[79:14.62]That's what I like to hear.
[79:24.11]Dragon Talon?
[79:26.83]Ooh, amusement crafting.
[79:31.50]No one said that.
[79:32.54]Go look at the logs.
[79:33.20]Yes, they did.
[79:37.20]Do I have a heal, turtle?
[80:00.23]Insufficient inventory space.
[80:01.39]Potion used.
[80:02.49]Oh, I'm out of room.
[80:03.41]What is it, Torval?
[80:04.21]Got something!
[80:25.56]Why trust in your own animal instinct when you now have an actual animal at your side?
[80:29.42]If you're lost, hold down L3.
[80:32.88]Let Torgl point you in the right direction.
[80:37.73]Ooh.
[80:40.29]Shush, bye.
[80:40.79]No!
[80:41.27]Okay.
[80:42.59]Here we go.
[80:51.35]There we go.
[80:52.55]That's what I was trying to do.
[80:54.03]That's what I was going for.
[80:59.66]After it.
[81:02.58]Oh, a treat.
[81:11.87]My mouse is on the unsubscribe button.
[81:14.73]You better be careful.
[81:17.61]I was careful.
[81:18.31]It's hovering over it.
[81:23.23]Well, they'll answer after.
[81:25.60]And for once, it's no more fun.
[81:48.11]New enemies approach.
[81:50.83]This is stupid.
[81:51.88]Alright, get rid of this thing first.
[82:20.83]You're so precise.
[82:23.01]Did you give your thoughts on the Mario RPG remake?
[82:25.75]I did.
[82:26.03]It went like this.
[82:54.33]Just make sure you take that image and, like, blow the contrast up times a thousand.
[82:59.57]Make my eyes wicked blue.
[83:02.63]Wicked blue.
[83:03.39]Way blue.
[83:03.90]More blue than they really are.
[83:05.08]And then superimpose that on top of any other topic.
[83:26.36]Yeah, I'm very excited about it.
[83:28.10]Like, one of my favorite... Yeah, no, guys.
[83:30.51]One of my favorite games ever created.
[83:34.11]Ever.
[83:34.47]Since I was a child.
[83:36.67]No, I don't.
[83:37.77]You know, whatever.
[83:39.67]Whoops-a-daisy.
[83:42.93]Whoops-a-daisy.
[83:47.96]I'm very excited for it.
[84:02.81]Boss fight.
[84:03.23]Alright.
[84:06.26]Make sure you get your look at how precise he is comments ready.
[84:12.05]I'd like to see them very soon.
[84:13.19]You better hope so.
[84:17.84]This shouldn't take too long.
[84:20.29]So much for your shortcut.
[84:23.99]Still short, just not quite as quick.
[84:26.43]But it'll be a downside quicker if you help me.
[84:33.55]I think so exactly.
[84:46.05]Ow!
[84:50.96]alright alright alright we just got real here oh shit that really hurt
[85:21.35]Ooh, it takes a little bit longer.
[85:25.34]Ooh, look at how precise he is.
[85:36.08]Shit.
[85:47.95]I could have gotten hit every time.
[85:49.45]Nobody said that, I did.
[85:54.56]Alright, let's go.
[86:06.07]That wasn't bad.
[86:15.53]Aye aye, someone's got the ult.
[86:19.07]Where he stops, no one knows.
[86:24.92]Oh my god!
[86:28.23]What?
[86:28.73]Oh.
[86:29.61]God damn it.
[86:58.57]Oh, I thought I dodged it.
[87:05.62]No, I wanted to... Charge it.
[87:37.38]Alright, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[87:53.00]See you later.
[87:54.43]Get a boy.
[88:05.32]Alright, I'm going to end it like this.
[88:07.06]One, two, three, goodbye.
[88:13.38]I will never stop spamming caps.
[88:16.06]Well, you're going to get timed out.
[88:21.04]Pretty good precision, I think.
[88:31.28]Move your camera.
[88:33.06]Where do I go with it?
[88:35.94]Right here.
[88:39.58]Phase two.
[88:43.54]Come on.
[88:45.05]Stand back.
[89:06.71]That was actually pretty, pretty great.
[89:14.47]You are.
[89:16.45]You're a dominant.
[89:21.02]I am I. Well, not by choice, mind.
[89:25.82]Oh, bloody realm of strapping young lads.
[89:29.00]And it was this sorry sack of bones realm who saw fit to home.
[89:37.66]He's so cool.
[89:39.28]Sid.
[89:39.54]Did he let that with... You say you want to help dominance and bearers.
[89:45.93]But what's in it for you?
[89:48.13]That's a good image.
[89:49.25]But I don't want to put it on screen.
[89:51.67]What's in it for me?
[89:53.55]The same as for all of us.
[89:55.69]What we want and deserve.
[89:58.84]Save for our knack, dominance and bearers are no different from anyone else.
[90:04.11]The ability to use magic or summon great beasts should command respect, but instead has left us outcasts.
[90:10.44]Our kind are used and discarded like tools, yet we are men, so why must we die as less?
[90:16.22]I see.
[90:17.30]So what you're saying is you want to start a war.
[90:23.87]You flatter me lad, but my days is a firebrand along behind me No, I only wish to offer our kind of choice a place where we can die on our own terms Take a big shove I'll feel good boy
[90:57.61]Can I give him a treat too?
[90:58.59]I was like, here!
[91:00.62]He was like... Anything I'm missing here?
[91:10.71]Damn.
[91:27.36]Clyde, what exactly do you plan on doing when you find this Dominant of Fire?
[91:33.03]What do you think?
[91:35.09]I'll show him the mercy he showed my brother, and cut out the tongue of any man who tries to talk me out of it.
[91:40.31]Alright.
[91:42.73]Forrest's dark enough, is he?
[92:08.72]Taking it in.
[92:09.28]I have 11 Hornets.
[92:38.92]Level 11 Hornets.
[92:41.84]Yeah, the soundtrack is so good.
[92:44.95]I love it.
[92:50.55]You know when I'm asking for OSTs?
[92:52.97]Like, oh man, is there an OST you guys want to listen to?
[92:55.15]I already got one.
[92:56.29]I'll put on this one.
[93:01.04]See that river?
[93:01.56]We follow her upstream and we'll be in Lost Wing in no time.
[93:06.66]In no time.
[93:08.54]right coming over here okay I'm going over here whoa okay easy easy a little help
[93:43.99]Thought I dodged it.
[93:45.23]My wounds, boy!
[93:47.45]Not bad.
[94:06.16]Not this time.
[94:50.52]Bloody hides?
[94:55.82]Ocean.
[94:56.14]Actually, I need to.
[94:58.72]Okay.
[95:00.10]Something in this cave.
[95:04.85]Meteorite.
[95:09.55]This way.
[95:11.21]Dude, epic Jerma.
[95:12.13]Great job.
[95:12.63]Thanks.
[95:22.20]Quiet.
[95:23.96]Yeah, I'm off.
[95:26.58]Stop talking to yourself.
[95:27.98]That's literally a live streamer.
[95:30.34]The Royal Scout.
[95:33.02]Someone's far from home.
[95:36.24]Let's follow him.
[95:37.64]Uh-oh.
[95:57.06]And?
[95:57.60]We don't need a lore check.
[96:01.46]They're just down that way.
[96:03.46]All of them.
[96:04.37]Grigor's my witness.
[96:08.58]excellent we move dude I forgot everything please can I have a lore check I don't understand have I not proven loyal
[96:31.95]God.
[96:32.07]Damn.
[97:02.13]What did she do that for?
[97:07.99]She was showing off.
[97:11.84]If you could make magic come out of your hands, you wouldn't just show off randomly to your friends?
[97:29.88]Imagine the birthday parties you'd be able to make so much cooler.
[97:32.18]Let's go.
[97:33.76]You're already dead.
[97:34.50]That guy was lying on the ground when we got over here.
[98:08.77]Ow, that hurt.
[98:39.37]It's rank time.
[98:39.97]Oh my god.
[98:40.57]I'm going to... Get up!
[99:08.24]Big damage, big damage.
[99:10.46]Oh my god.
[99:14.47]Cinematic clash!
[99:15.45]When the screen flashes orange like this during a pivotal moment, repeat it- Don't even tell me anything else.
[100:03.75]That hurt.
[100:06.97]There you go.
[100:45.10]Everybody get him!
[101:04.15]Buton?
[101:05.75]What's Buton?
[101:09.03]Oh!
[101:19.17]Oh, I'm gonna die.
[101:20.11]No, I'm not.
[101:42.31]Cap?
[101:58.86]Again.
[102:06.75]Oh shit.
[102:11.37]The boss fights are so fucking fun.
[102:13.23]I'm just telling you.
[102:23.38]Badge of Might is an accessory.
[102:28.41]Oh, it is.
[102:28.91]Okay.
[102:29.61]Attack by seven.
[102:31.11]Look at how precise that was.
[102:32.15]That's not even a boss either.
[102:33.62]Really?
[102:35.94]Still working fine.
[102:39.82]I'm sleeping right now.
[102:40.46]My dreams are kind of weird.
[102:41.56]How are you typing?
[102:48.12]What's the face you make when you hit a cinematic slash?
[102:50.92]This one.
[102:54.90]They thought we were Imperials.
[102:58.20]Well, you do look the part.
[103:03.92]Though you fight like a true shield of Rosaria and one blessed by the phoenix.
[103:09.53]What's wrong with that face?
[103:21.29]Speaking of which, I wonder, does the other icon of fire give blessings, do you think?
[103:29.43]You don't believe me.
[103:32.69]And lo, the Creator did make of the elements eight icons to serve as keepers of the one roar.
[103:41.16]Not that I've ever set too much store by holy doxing, but on that point, it's clear.
[103:50.06]Fire has always had just the one warden, as of all the rest.
[103:54.12]A new one can't be born until the previous dies.
[103:57.39]And even that can take years.
[104:03.53]Thank God the face game is too scary for me.
[104:05.79]You don't strike me as a liar.
[104:11.10]Which leaves but one person who might be able to shed some light on the matter.
[104:16.34]And they're in a swing.
[104:21.92]Oh, son, what game you playing?
[104:23.27]Can you catch me up on the walk before I walk upstairs?
[104:26.11]We should hurry before it gets dark.
[104:29.26]But what if someone discovers the bodies?
[104:31.63]Well, then they'll be sorely disappointed.
[104:46.01]Stage replay in arcade mode.
[104:47.88]Is it arcade mode?
[104:52.06]In the hideaway.
[104:52.70]So you can just kind of do... I wonder what arcade mode is.
[105:06.23]So this is Orabel Downs.
[105:08.17]Alright, so there's new missions back here.
[105:10.57]I kind of want to upgrade my weapon.
[105:13.01]Or should I just keep going?
[105:17.59]There's a new side quest back here.
[105:23.25]I think I should upgrade.
[105:23.95]I want to check it out.
[105:31.02]Hey, you do you?
[105:32.62]Yeah.
[105:38.72]New crafting recipe is available.
[105:42.04]Yes.
[105:43.28]What?
[105:46.05]Going purse weighing you down?
[105:47.57]Longsword.
[105:49.85]Longsword's better than... Wait.
[105:51.27]Okay.
[105:56.57]Longsword.
[105:57.03]How much money do I have?
[105:58.39]I got money.
[106:06.24]Finished, are you?
[106:08.20]Is it worth spending 700 right now?
[106:22.13]I could craft a longsword.
[106:24.51]Or I could do... Is broadsword plus one as good as... Maybe I should craft a longsword and upgrade a longsword?
[106:35.09]This does take a dragon talon, though.
[106:39.37]I would probably just go buy it.
[106:42.55]I'm going to go buy it and then upgrade it.
[106:49.33]Wait, do I... No, I don't have one already.
[106:52.78]I don't think you have the longsword equipped.
[106:54.86]I don't think I have the longsword.
[106:56.16]Because I bought the broadsword.
[106:59.22]And the thing I started was the Imperial Infantry Blade.
[107:01.42]It's just the starter weapon.
[107:02.70]I have the broadsword on right now, but the longsword looks like it's just better.
[107:05.33]I'm going to buy... It says you own it?
[107:10.41]I don't think so.
[107:12.60]Alright.
[107:16.26]I'll buy it.
[107:18.88]I want to save the materials.
[107:21.84]I'll sell the broadsword back.
[107:25.44]I think that makes sense, right?
[107:28.30]Make it quick.
[107:30.94]So, will it be?
[107:34.19]Because crafting this, I have to use a gnarled scale.
[107:36.77]I have two of those.
[107:37.83]With this one, I... Oh.
[107:38.83]Yeah, see?
[107:42.21]I have to use a gnarled scale for this.
[107:43.77]Why not just use it on upgrades?
[107:45.27]I have the money.
[107:47.69]Let's go for it.
[107:53.98]I could do it again.
[107:54.62]I have three meteorites.
[108:01.82]I'm just going to go again.
[108:04.02]you can find me later I could do it again no I couldn't cool alright keep going I think that's all I can do so let me what about other stuff iron bracers I think I have I have iron I could do iron belt +2
[108:30.25]Although, what about... Okay, Wolfskin Sash.
[108:34.11]28.
[108:34.35]28 versus 26 and 2 health.
[108:40.92]This one just gives... Defense versus health?
[108:48.55]Just don't get hit?
[108:51.15]That's true.
[108:52.03]I'll take the health.
[108:57.55]This is just better, though.
[109:00.24]Alright, I'm going to... Alright, here's what's happening.
[109:01.52]I'm going to make this sash.
[109:04.26]Then I'll upgrade it.
[109:06.10]Okay, so this is going to give me four health.
[109:17.85]Yeah, see this is only two.
[109:18.95]Even if it's +2.
[109:19.93]Okay, yeah, we'll do this one.
[109:20.67]+2.
[109:21.27]Trophy earned.
[109:22.95]Okay, cool.
[109:29.74]Can't really do any of these.
[109:33.42]Do I have Iron Bursts on right now?
[109:34.94]I do.
[109:37.17]Okay, we're good.
[109:40.55]I should buy some heals though, right?
[109:44.25]Kind of low.
[109:47.90]It's installed.
[109:50.22]Why do you look like a Giga Chat right now?
[109:52.30]I think I look like Giga Chat.
[109:58.45]What do you got?
[109:58.89]You got a mission?
[110:01.25]Damn it.
[110:02.57]We'll be needing more wood.
[110:04.98]If I step away to fetch any, this lot will be down around our ears.
[110:11.36]Ah, you there.
[110:12.64]Perfect timing.
[110:14.00]I couldn't persuade you to fetch me some timber, could I?
[110:17.12]Ooh.
[110:20.57]What do I get for it?
[110:22.23]I'd be happy to.
[110:24.21]Oh, thank you.
[110:25.33]You'll be helping me and the hideaway both.
[110:28.27]Side mission.
[110:29.52]Let's go.
[110:31.72]More than we can manage, if I'm honest.
[110:34.14]It certainly looks like you've got your hands full.
[110:36.94]Ah, you can say that again.
[110:38.42]The Fallen knew their craft, make no mistake.
[110:40.89]But not even their handiwork lasts forever.
[110:43.05]This guy looks like the kind of person that always finishes top three in the arm wrestling competition every year.
[110:53.38]No, I suppose not.
[110:56.56]Alright, where can I find this word?
[110:58.78]Ask over at the white ads.
[111:01.15]They'll point you in the right direction.
[111:03.25]Thanks again.
[111:03.75]I really appreciate the help.
[111:07.33]Yeah.
[111:10.93]Let's prioritize this.
[111:11.83]Let's do some good stuff.
[111:16.15]Hashtag ad.
[111:17.09]Oh, yeah.
[111:19.55]Square Enix sponsored this stream.
[111:23.05]I think the game's fantastic.
[111:25.65]I really mean that.
[111:27.05]I'm going to finish this game.
[111:29.57]I'm going to play it all the way through.
[111:32.85]I really like it.
[111:33.91]Yeah, it's out on PS5 right now.
[111:38.69]You can also get the demo.
[111:39.69]The demo is still available too.
[111:44.07]Okay, I want to sell some stuff.
[111:47.45]I'm going to sell the broadsword.
[111:48.49]It's probably a bad idea, but somebody will scream at me.
[111:54.25]I'm getting rid of, like, the infantry belt.
[111:56.19]I know, but what about, like, just for, like, for drip?
[111:59.41]No, it's fine.
[112:02.63]Alright, I gotta equip this.
[112:04.15]Alright, I don't want to put these ones on.
[112:12.98]This is the, uh, the rings that give you much more damage and power and stuff.
[112:19.50]I just want this one, the one that I found.
[112:27.15]There is my sword.
[112:28.37]That looks good.
[112:29.23]Okay.
[112:30.05]Yeah, it's only on PS5 right now.
[112:36.81]Only on PS5.
[112:42.86]Can you see the chats, donations, things?
[112:45.22]Yeah, like I said before, I'm not reading them.
[112:49.14]It's a new feature.
[112:49.82]I don't really know what it is, but I'll look into it.
[112:51.47]I'll see what it is.
[112:52.69]But I can reiterate, I do not read donations or subs on stream.
[112:57.17]It's a policy I've had for a long time.
[113:01.41]And I can tell you why.
[113:04.21]But I've already, you know... Let's go.
[113:09.43]Excuse me.
[113:11.48]Do I have to cut the wood?
[113:12.80]So let's just grab it.
[113:13.43]Collect the planks.
[113:38.33]Here we are.
[113:40.09]We better get this to... Jeffrey, was it?
[113:46.78]Hold on, let me help you here.
[113:49.18]Ah, fuck if I know, man.
[113:53.32]I don't know either.
[113:53.94]Oh, you're back.
[114:05.64]Hope fetching that wood wasn't too much trouble.
[114:12.11]Do I get money for this?
[114:14.33]Will this be enough?
[114:16.39]This will do nicely, thank you.
[114:18.72]With a bit of luck, the walls won't be falling in on us just yet.
[114:22.78]That sounds ominous.
[114:26.38]Oh, it's not as bad as all that.
[114:28.16]Then it's a damn sight better than the alternative.
[114:30.76]We're safe, we're warm, and we're hidden.
[114:32.87]What more could we ask for?
[114:34.79]Now stop fretting and take this.
[114:36.77]You've earned it.
[114:37.75]Welcome to the Fold.
[114:40.78]and there's no need to that's not a matter of need my friend you're one of us now what do I get what do I get meteorite that's pretty good and a gill bug
[115:03.05]Contrary to popular belief, this small insect does not get its name from its appearance, but rather from the fact that it is highly sought after by... Physickers?
[115:13.64]Physickers?
[115:14.82]For use in brewing medicines.
[115:18.78]In summer, when the beetles are most numerous, children across the realm will spend nigh every waking hour collecting specimens in readiness to exchange them for a handful of coppers.
[115:29.30]As children have tiny hands, however, this amounts to fewer than one might expect.
[115:43.21]Rate this bug on a tier list.
[115:46.83]I don't know.
[115:48.61]B?
[115:49.71]Alright, so I can sell that.
[115:51.47]Should I sell it?
[115:52.55]What if I get more stuff?
[115:53.51]Oh, I'm curious about the arcade mode thing.
[116:00.36]I want to see it.
[116:04.36]Replay any previously cleared stage and be awarded a score based on performance.
[116:08.62]Restrictions on level gear consumables are applied.
[116:12.30]Gameplay mode will default to action focused.
[116:16.30]Alright, that's cool.
[116:18.44]Like a little challenge mode.
[116:23.08]Go see... Can you go see the Moogle?
[116:24.72]Where's the Moogle?
[116:26.36]Yeah, sure.
[116:33.78]Where's the Moogle?
[116:39.42]Why is everybody doing magic?
[116:45.93]Over by the board?
[116:51.86]What board?
[116:56.44]Why is everybody doing mad?
[116:57.38]What happened?
[117:00.62]Because they want Moogle.
[117:03.07]I gotta find Moogle.
[117:03.87]Alright, but let me sell this first.
[117:04.87]I just had to sell this for a lot of money.
[117:08.53]And what do you want?
[117:10.77]Go on, then.
[117:16.94]Eel bug.
[117:19.22]Valuable.
[117:19.82]Can be sold.
[117:24.99]200?
[117:26.43]Would you eat a bug, be honest?
[117:28.63]I don't know.
[117:30.15]Maybe.
[117:30.45]I wouldn't be happy about it, but it would be like, whatever.
[117:33.85]Do I have to eat bugs?
[117:34.67]I don't know.
[117:35.73]No.
[117:36.91]I don't know.
[117:37.37]I don't know.
[117:41.15]Alright.
[117:42.76]Let's go.
[117:44.50]Wait.
[117:46.46]Quest.
[117:54.91]Do you think we should go and help?
[117:57.29]Don't think I. I want to make as much money as I can.
[118:01.19]Ah, a new face and dare, I hope a willing pair of hands.
[118:06.56]The fat chocobo is a demanding mistress and we are too few to keep her on her feet.
[118:11.44]Might I persuade?
[118:12.36]That looks good.
[118:12.98]For a meal or two to souls in need of sustenance.
[118:16.44]For your trouble, I can offer you the contents of my strong box and my enduring gratitude.
[118:23.68]There's not going to be anything in there.
[118:27.00]Oh, there's 500 bucks in there.
[118:28.20]I don't see why not.
[118:31.44]Marvelous.
[118:32.28]And who exactly do I have the honor of addressing?
[118:35.77]Clive.
[118:37.73]Delighted to make your acquaintance, Clive.
[118:40.13]I'm Kenneth, and mine are the weary shoulders upon which the weight of this fine establishment rests.
[118:46.67]Now, I have three hungry customers awaiting their vittles.
[118:50.02]Take these, if you would, and be careful.
[118:52.50]They're hot.
[118:55.38]I would eat that right now.
[119:04.92]How long has it been?
[119:06.41]Can I just eat them all?
[119:07.55]There you go.
[119:15.79]Your food.
[119:19.91]I was hoping it might be well doesn't this look fine thank you lad you're new aren't you Kenneth's running your ragged already I expect the old rascal well very hot be careful say he'd give me something for my trouble and so he should we're not slaves anymore well met lot and keep up the good work
[119:48.69]I'm going to get 500 bucks.
[119:54.93]Yeah.
[119:59.79]Fully clad in armor, bringing your food to your table.
[120:03.03]I hope you do not think me lazy for waiting to be served like a Lord.
[120:07.24]I mean, it's like a bunch of themed restaurants do that already, don't they?
[120:10.88]Did not use me kindly.
[120:12.48]You see, you left me half laying, truth be told.
[120:17.48]But Sid took me in nonetheless.
[120:20.02]Precise.
[120:23.46]The Hideaway is the home I never knew.
[120:26.78]And a mighty fine one at that.
[120:32.78]Enjoy.
[120:41.46]Any frosty bread?
[120:47.30]How can you have stew and no crusty bread?
[120:49.52]Well, well.
[120:51.18]There's so much more to farming than just seeds and soil.
[120:54.34]I'm talking bread that you have to like.
[120:58.00]Your food.
[120:59.45]Just a moment.
[121:00.25]I need to finish this.
[121:01.69]I won't be a burden.
[121:03.71]I'm of no use to anyone as I am, but maybe if I can master this.
[121:07.81]Alright, Ben.
[121:10.39]See that you eat it before it gets cold.
[121:12.89]Of course.
[121:15.60]Thank you.
[121:16.70]If I had a restaurant, I would name it with crusty bread.
[121:21.90]That would be the name of my restaurant.
[121:26.16]With crusty bread.
[121:26.98]It'd be such a really hearty... Everybody knows when you come in.
[121:36.49]When you're here, you come in here.
[121:38.25]You're a family in here.
[121:39.07]You know what I mean?
[121:39.75]Yeah.
[121:48.96]Wait, did I not feed him?
[121:49.80]Oh, no, no, no.
[121:51.50]I gotta turn it in.
[121:53.40]Stay away from my family.
[121:53.90]Okay.
[121:54.04]You know everything's gonna be warm.
[122:16.10]Give me like candles and shit.
[122:17.00]We have the best crusty bread in the city.
[122:18.39]There's no utensils.
[122:43.32]Now, I promised you something for your trouble, did I not?
[122:46.50]This bread is going to be so hard and so shit.
[122:50.14]You're going to have to pull it apart and you're going to use that as utensil to eat your soup and stew and stuff.
[123:01.50]The bread is your utensil.
[123:08.57]And why?
[123:09.15]Right.
[123:09.29]That's pretty good.
[123:10.19]And 500 bucks.
[123:10.97]Just that was alright.
[123:15.00]The table is made out of bread.
[123:19.34]That restaurant would be open for... Okay.
[123:22.60]First of all, that restaurant's open for one or two days before the whole thing gets closed.
[123:29.93]Everything is edible!
[123:34.01]Somebody's dog is gonna get- you know what I mean?
[123:35.75]An animal's gonna get- like a bear is gonna get into that restaurant.
[123:37.89]It's gonna be a fucking nightmare.
[123:41.37]They'd be like, hey, stop beating the posts to the table.
[123:44.83]Oh, no.
[123:48.59]Rats.
[123:48.95]Yeah, they'd be all... It'd be animals.
[123:50.39]There'd be just animals all over the place.
[123:53.89]It'd be like a weird cartoon moment where you'd be sitting there eating.
[123:56.31]Oh, did you know that the table is edible?
[124:00.86]And it just cuts down to one of the posts of the table and there's a rat just gnawing on the very bottom to have it fall out.
[124:07.96]And it just, the whole table falls and like grandpa's soup goes up in his face.
[124:16.81]The whole restaurant's edible.
[124:26.01]The bathroom would have to be normal, though.
[124:27.89]The bathroom isn't.
[124:28.71]It's a normal bathroom.
[124:30.59]We can't have edible fucking urinals.
[124:32.95]And edible toilets, guys.
[124:34.67]The bathroom isn't a normal bathroom.
[124:38.49]That does not work.
[124:44.32]Why not?
[124:44.82]Alright, let's go.
[124:48.12]That was fun.
[124:49.18]I got my upgrades.
[124:50.06]I'm ready to move.
[124:52.26]Let's do the next part.
[124:58.88]No one was thinking that except for you.
[125:00.44]I was thinking ahead, actually.
[125:03.96]I was thinking ahead.
[125:04.66]Go back and get the chest?
[125:06.62]Wait, what do you mean the chest?
[125:07.68]Didn't he just deposit it into my fucking account?
[125:18.45]I didn't realize we were this close.
[125:23.30]Any idea what that is they built the village around?
[125:25.51]Get the chest.
[125:26.09]Just give me one second.
[125:27.83]I have to go back.
[125:56.53]Tuning with an obelisk allows Clive to travel quickly to the location via both the world map and local map.
[126:03.32]Cool.
[126:08.22]Louder than words.
[126:11.02]Let me go back to the... Are you guys messing with me here?
[126:14.67]Is that for real?
[126:17.29]This isn't the first time I've seen one of these.
[126:20.11]Perhaps I can use them as waymarks.
[126:24.91]Are you guys being for real?
[126:30.92]Is there actually something in here?
[126:32.00]Is there a chest I didn't get on the table?
[126:45.31]Oh, there is.
[126:48.51]I thought you guys were lying to me.
[126:51.01]Okay, hold on.
[126:54.16]That's important.
[126:55.36]Thank you.
[127:00.17]That was badge of metal defense.
[127:03.17]Yeah, we're going to put that on.
[127:04.18]Of course we are.
[127:17.53]Alright.
[127:19.01]Let's go back.
[127:33.18]Guys, your face came weird.
[127:36.38]This is my face.
[127:38.14]And you can say my face is weird.
[127:39.72]I mean, be rude.
[127:41.88]But that's your opinion on how you feel about my face.
[127:46.97]I also have an opinion that your opinion is... No, let's just play.
[127:54.79]Why is it so small?
[127:55.61]I want you to focus on the gameplay.
[127:57.71]Definitely foe.
[128:04.91]I don't know.
[128:06.21]Sid.
[128:06.39]It really depends on if you start hearing music or not when we walk up here.
[128:13.52]Do you hear it?
[128:16.46]No?
[128:18.04]They might be friends.
[128:20.32]Yup.
[128:22.00]Let's go!
[128:39.80]Damn!
[129:02.95]Dude, you're blocking gameplay.
[129:04.23]I am not blocking gameplay.
[129:05.99]I'm in a perfect spot.
[129:12.92]Combat looks so fucking fun.
[129:16.14]Combat is so freaking fun.
[129:28.89]No, it actually is.
[129:30.75]The, uh...
[129:35.85]You're in the center of the screen.
[129:37.77]I think I'm in a perfect spot.
[129:41.49]This is right over the stuff down here.
[129:43.31]I'm not blocking anything.
[129:47.31]No sign of the Royalists.
[129:49.66]Or anyone else for that matter.
[129:52.24]It's too bloody quiet.
[129:54.72]Even for this hour.
[129:56.64]What do we do now?
[129:58.28]First we look for my scout.
[130:00.00]You start here.
[130:00.92]I'll circle around the back.
[130:03.76]How do I let you know if I find him?
[130:06.21]Good question.
[130:08.33]Shout?
[130:11.53]Subtle.
[130:18.87]Yeah, the combat director of the game, Ryota Suzuki, which Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma.
[130:27.78]I'm curious.
[130:29.72]You're like, wow, that combat looks really great.
[130:32.86]Combat director of the game.
[130:33.90]So...
[130:36.80]the village can't be completely very very cool alright this looks like a I have to pay attention here very cool very cool very cool okay I hear music that sounds like a child
[131:09.32]Everything alright?
[131:11.26]We should play Dragon's Dogma sometime.
[131:12.68]I saw Sturv.
[131:13.94]Sturv made a video on it.
[131:15.66]It's funny.
[131:15.94]Go.
[131:38.25]But not yet, because I want to see if you have any... Didn't gill anywhere.
[131:41.86]I feel like it's a lot more urgent than this.
[131:55.77]What is he doing over there?
[132:01.59]Is he mocking this entire situation?
[132:06.85]Just skipping around.
[132:07.81]I think I missed nothing.
[132:19.24]Stop skipping.
[132:19.88]You're breaking my immersion.
[132:21.58]True.
[132:40.35]you speak in a british accent for the entire stream no but 5 000 of you will leave you hate when I do that everybody hates when I do that more than anything everybody hates it
[133:07.78]This man's gonna die if we don't get into a healer.
[133:10.62]Enough of your barking, dog.
[133:15.82]About time.
[133:23.89]That was fucking awesome.
[133:27.51]Didn't even... That was... I loved that so much.
[133:33.34]Who the hell are you?
[133:34.64]It was just right on cue.
[133:35.79]And I have a view of barking.
[133:38.77]Dog.
[133:39.45]Boom.
[133:40.55]Not even a small second.
[133:41.85]It was right when he was done talking.
[133:44.57]Barely.
[133:45.23]Just right in the back of the head.
[133:47.17]Been doing what I can for the villagers.
[133:49.35]What?
[133:51.25]I thought you were joking.
[133:53.43]It's alright.
[133:54.21]He's with me.
[133:56.56]Is this everyone?
[133:58.15]No, there were others.
[134:00.25]A pair of royalists came for the bearers just before you arrived.
[134:03.97]Was a dominant among them?
[134:08.81]Maybe.
[134:09.25]It's not like you is old in a sign.
[134:22.72]Oh shit!
[134:24.55]Clive, after him.
[134:28.82]This is great.
[134:31.02]We're just chasing this guy?
[134:32.14]We actually have to chase this guy down.
[134:43.05]Oh shit.
[134:44.59]The really good part of the song is starting.
[134:46.27]That means I'm dead.
[134:47.67]I'm dead in like 10 seconds.
[134:50.47]I gotta run as fast as I fucking can.
[134:55.96]As long as I don't hear those fucking trumpets, mate, I'm gonna be just fine.
[135:00.25]Any word from the scouts?
[135:02.99]Not yet, my lady, but we have the Dominant's companion.
[135:06.13]It's only a matter of time before we seize our quarry.
[135:10.26]Very good.
[135:11.58]And what of the others?
[135:13.82]The bearers have been taken to Caer Norvent.
[135:18.50]Some may still be worth keeping should the Dominant elude us.
[135:22.32]All is in hand, my lady.
[135:23.74]That big turkey leg.
[135:25.56]I give you my word.
[135:30.60]Gentlemen, a toast.
[135:32.58]Will you join me?
[135:35.48]My thanks.
[135:36.14]To our lady of the wind.
[135:40.51]And the king!
[135:48.37]Imperials drink this piss?
[135:50.39]Well, it would go some way to explain their breath.
[135:57.08]You are disgusting.
[135:58.84]Everybody back nowadays were gross.
[136:01.15]We had disgusting breath and smelly bodies.
[136:04.01]We all smell.
[136:11.41]And instead of killing them, you lead the rats straight to us.
[136:15.46]Mercy.
[136:18.78]This poor guy.
[136:19.64]This poor guy had to run in two directions.
[136:22.79]Oh, I feel bad for this guy.
[136:24.51]That was just so bad.
[136:28.27]An imperial bearer.
[136:29.75]Good.
[136:32.54]I was getting bored.
[136:43.65]Recruited that guy.
[136:47.51]Mm-hmm.
[137:22.02]Torgl!
[137:22.22]I have no potions.
[137:24.00]I have to actually be really careful here.
[137:44.99]Too slow.
[137:45.23]Not this time.
[138:32.29]Let's go!
[138:55.77]I love ending it like that with a charge shot.
[138:57.49]It just feels so good.
[139:04.55]You have the worst face cam out of any streamer I know.
[139:06.65]Uh, alright.
[139:17.64]I don't... It's just a cam, whatever.
[139:35.68]Turn it off.
[139:37.55]They don't appreciate it.
[139:38.59]Remind me, why was it that you betrayed your kingdom?
[140:02.80]Why does she keep saying that, Cid?
[140:05.78]Cid, what's going on here?
[140:07.62]This wasn't in the lore check.
[140:09.22]I looked at it before I even started hanging out with you.
[140:12.76]You lie on your resume?
[140:34.91]Who's that guy?
[140:35.35]Okay!
[140:35.47]That's Gav!
[141:00.91]That's Cid's faithful scout who puts his legendary nose to work in tracking the movements of slavers, soldiers, and any other object of interest to the hideaway.
[141:09.65]The ever-agreeable fellow only too gladly delving behind enemy lines if he can get a good story out of it or two.
[141:18.43]Okay.
[141:18.87]Good.
[141:19.21]Cool.
[141:20.33]Let me just... Remind me again.
[141:21.71]Commander of the Kingdom of... Okay.
[141:28.85]Alright.
[141:29.25]Got it.
[141:31.24]Got it.
[141:41.73]Finally explaining the lore.
[141:43.33]I told you last week when we played the demo.
[141:45.85]I unironically think that is one of the best features of this game.
[141:50.31]I want more of that.
[141:52.13]Which is why I sent Gav.
[141:59.30]The man has a nose for these things.
[142:02.16]Trust me.
[142:08.08]Especially for a game that's, you know, you come back, you jump back and forth, jump into it.
[142:13.49]Sometimes I'll play a game and I'll come back a week or two later and it's just like, I don't even know who the fuck any of these people are.
[142:18.21]It's very helpful.
[142:19.21]Unironically, I mean it.
[142:20.17]Yeah.
[142:27.38]so it wasn't about bears at all they unironically again that's right I thought we were riding the bastard like any of us would keep a monster like that under our roof no offense when no one talked they started rounding up everyone with a brand
[142:45.05]And then everyone without one and all.
[142:47.47]And locked you in the cellar, hoping sooner or later someone would break.
[142:54.22]You know, things might have been different if you'd accepted my invitation.
[143:02.44]Oh, don't remind us.
[143:03.58]We were all saying the same thing.
[143:05.08]This is our home, innit?
[143:07.16]Don't mean we won't help when we can, though.
[143:09.20]And that, I'll drink to.
[143:14.18]I just wish one of them would be like, ah, yes, I'll drink to that.
[143:16.90]And he goes like... Let's do something weird.
[143:21.63]Like, ooh!
[143:23.07]Would people still think it was cool?
[143:32.81]Listen, Clive.
[143:33.77]Revenge won't bring him back.
[143:36.72]It won't.
[143:37.22]Thirteen years ago,
[143:59.65]I watched a dominant kill my brother right in front of me.
[144:04.34]And I did nothing.
[144:08.26]But now I can.
[144:11.64]I can kill the son of a bitch and bring peace to my brother's soul.
[144:20.14]After that, whatever happens, happens.
[144:26.41]Fight.
[144:28.67]You're content to be its slave, then?
[144:40.54]That's what I'm saying!
[144:41.32]That's what I was... Like, Cid, there's nothing in that cup.
[144:44.82]Cid, there's nothing in there.
[144:46.08]That cup has been empty for, like, 40 minutes.
[144:52.66]He did the thing!
[144:53.49]Oh, it just keeps getting better.
[144:54.53]This radiance would have us believe the Imperial host invincible.
[144:59.56]Yet here we find the Empire's cornerstone teetering on the backs of a handful of cowards and cutthroats.
[145:09.77]Well, Bahamut may lead a hundred full legions.
[145:13.21]Could it be that the young prince defends a house of cards ready to topple at the slightest breeze?
[145:18.73]But I recognize that guy's voice.
[145:21.14]He's in Game of Thrones.
[145:22.46]Pretty big part in Game of Thrones.
[145:25.54]Why do you not resist?
[145:29.15]Within you lies the power to slay gods.
[145:32.49]The Phoenix perished in your flames.
[145:36.27]Yet you do not fight.
[145:38.43]You do not flee.
[145:41.11]You refuse your gift.
[145:50.02]Perhaps you are distracted.
[146:06.00]my offer still stands join us and you will be treated with the respect one of our kind desserts ow that's not a good you're literally like hurting me why would I do that lord malgrace don't
[146:31.95]I'll give you a moment to consider your options.
[146:35.73]Wouldn't you want to make it seem like what you were doing was like... Do be gentle with them.
[146:40.07]Like, hey, I'm gonna... By the way, here's like a full steak dinner.
[146:44.02]And... Like, you know, you want one of these swords?
[146:48.16]We can make one for you.
[146:50.30]What's your favorite movie?
[146:51.92]We can get it on an emblem on the handle for you.
[146:53.66]Or your favorite play.
[146:55.88]Whatever.
[146:56.50]You know?
[146:56.94]What's your favorite book?
[147:02.39]Wake up.
[147:03.31]Gav's back.
[147:07.33]Yeah, I get Pulp Fiction on the emblem.
[147:09.15]It's like the... Canovant.
[147:17.79]One of the Empire's outlying strongholds.
[147:20.36]Though apparently not strong enough to keep out the Royalists.
[147:23.44]The captured bearers are inside.
[147:26.00]I'm sure of it.
[147:27.84]If Benedicta's orders are to stay in the shadows, she won't be traveling with many men.
[147:32.36]Meaning she'll be keeping her prisoners together and close by.
[147:36.34]Including the dominant.
[147:38.32]So we find a way into the fortress.
[147:40.36]It's freaking Gav.
[147:41.42]Conjure a bit of chaos.
[147:43.30]I hope Gav is a party member.
[147:45.36]What about me?
[147:46.06]What about Gav?
[147:47.14]Excellent question, Gav.
[147:48.74]You will wait outside the care and guide those eye-free to safety.
[147:53.10]I miss all the fun.
[147:54.10]Why can't he do that?
[147:56.55]I like Gav.
[147:56.93]If he doesn't have your nose, he'd stumble off a cliff before he even found the men.
[148:01.63]Come on, Gav.
[148:02.81]You're the best man for the job.
[148:06.23]Well, when you put it that way...
[148:10.93]Suppose I better scout ahead for any surprises.
[148:16.52]Don't you let him down.
[148:17.70]I won't.
[148:23.06]We're sending him out because he can smell things better than us.
[148:26.75]Not so fast.
[148:28.39]We wait until tomorrow.
[148:30.71]I bet you cannot name Gav's accent.
[148:31.95]It's Welsh.
[148:32.31]Thank you.
[148:33.29]What were you going to give me?
[149:06.70]Dude, I'm very precise.
[149:08.62]Okay, cool.
[149:17.47]New stock.
[149:18.23]Let me upgrade first.
[149:36.55]Is there a blacksmith here?
[149:37.37]There's a shop, but... Um... Eh.
[149:42.27]What do you got?
[149:48.49]What can I interest you in today?
[149:50.03]Give the best voice of the entire video game.
[149:54.97]Can I get you to talk more?
[149:56.01]Like way more?
[149:56.83]Where's that get you to talk 10 times more than you already have button?
[150:02.34]um I have the long sword I need potions yeah I'm kind of out of these these are expensive ah yes I hope it's your liking I trust it's all here
[150:32.75]I don't need more than this.
[150:37.77]$40,000.
[150:37.83]What is this?
[150:41.22]Adds a new song to the Hideaways Orchestrion.
[150:44.36]$40,000?
[150:45.66]Oh, that's a gold sink right there.
[150:48.86]I have like $3,000.
[150:59.28]Quentin, my good man, it seems we'll be spending the night.
[151:03.06]I thought as much.
[151:06.22]Where do you find that one?
[151:08.70]What, him?
[151:09.84]You won't believe me if I told you.
[151:13.89]Quentin here is an old friend, one who is sympathetic to our cause.
[151:19.11]Grind forward or we riot.
[151:22.09]And he knows about your little sanctuary.
[151:26.75]I would never have guessed so many people were bent on setting us free.
[151:32.11]When last I checked, the mere thought would only trip to the gallows.
[151:37.83]I am well aware of the risks, as I am of the rewards.
[151:45.42]And what could be more rewarding than your very own dominant of fire?
[151:49.54]A dominant?
[151:50.60]Here?
[151:52.20]Now that I would like to see.
[151:57.70]Meaning you haven't.
[151:59.42]No, but nothing passes unnoticed in Lostwing.
[152:02.26]Take your brand, for example.
[152:11.76]People will see that at once.
[152:16.27]And I need hardly tell you how they will greet the inquiries of a bearer.
[152:22.29]You are afraid your words will fall on deaf ears.
[152:28.68]as they have ever since the moment you were marked.
[152:34.30]Okay.
[152:38.96]Happily, I can provide a solution to your dilemma.
[152:43.24]As a favor to Cid, that is.
[152:50.23]Take this.
[152:53.05]You will find it has the uncanny power to loosen tongues.
[152:58.92]seal you accept the hanged man from may the mothers guide you this might be imperial land but here in lost wing it's his word that's law but how you don't need to worry about that just yet trust me everyone in lost wing knows what that seal means and what it means if they don't take note
[153:28.97]Now we can sit here counting our blessings or put them to good use and find that dominance.
[153:33.99]Your choice.
[153:36.69]I guess I'll use it for finding the dominant.
[153:41.90]Let's see if this thing really works.
[153:45.86]Gather information from the villagers.
[153:47.48]Okay.
[153:49.24]Is it to walk up to them and be like, hey, what do you know?
[153:53.38]And that's all you
[154:02.10]Ah, Master Quinson took a liking to you, I see.
[154:06.34]And there I was, thinking you were in bed with Cid.
[154:09.52]Wonder what Gav will have to say about this.
[154:13.07]Speaking of whom, if you see him, tell him thanks for looking after us.
[154:21.25]Now, what can I help you with?
[154:24.31]I'm searching for a dominant of fire.
[154:27.02]Gav seems to think he might have taken refuge here.
[154:30.43]We see a lot bearers around these parts.
[154:33.69]But I do seem to recall one who commanded the flame.
[154:37.15]Now, whether or not that makes him a dominant, I can't say.
[154:41.37]But the Weludas certainly took a keen interest in the poor sod.
[154:44.95]Did you get a look at him?
[154:47.95]Didn't have a chance.
[154:49.53]One of the other bearers might have done.
[154:51.91]Thank you.
[155:01.21]Okay.
[155:02.69]Oh, I don't know.
[155:08.99]What is this?
[155:09.47]What is this crystal?
[155:19.16]That thing's kind of cool.
[155:22.01]Get over here.
[155:24.31]Thank you.
[155:32.69]This is a genuine laugh.
[155:33.79]Alright, what do you know?
[155:47.64]That a hanged man, I see.
[155:50.44]Master Quentin must think you're important.
[155:53.08]It was a good thing you done today.
[155:55.18]Getting rid of those bastards.
[155:56.44]If you hadn't come when you did, I'd be on my way to Ash by now.
[156:01.77]I feel like I'm in an NPC dialog with another NPC and that character was the playable character coming to kill me.
[156:26.47]I wanna bite your head right now.
[156:28.63]Fucking relax.
[156:55.82]Alright, speak with Sid.
[157:02.14]Alright, got info.
[157:15.66]Tell me that skull means you've got good news.
[157:26.97]It's alright.
[157:27.87]It's alright.
[157:28.41]Just relax.
[157:29.06]Just relax.
[157:29.56]But...
[157:38.41]I've been thinking if our friend is a dominance, why not just burn the Royalist to a crisp?
[157:44.79]There's a reason he's holding back.
[157:46.37]Burn the Royalist to a crisp?
[157:47.30]I reckon he has something to do with his partner.
[157:49.64]That's such a horrible way to... One of the villagers I talked to said the two were separated.
[157:56.06]If the Walludas have her, our dominance like to think twice before starting any fires.
[158:01.16]Whoever he is, he's shown himself to have a level head.
[158:04.78]He's careful, cunning, and he doesn't want to be found.
[158:09.88]Let's do it.
[158:51.47]How come you're not skipping?
[158:53.23]I... Sorry.
[158:57.58]I forgot.
[158:58.18]Now, about those beds.
[159:03.82]Beds?
[159:05.29]I seem to recall your request being to spend the night.
[159:09.15]And for that, the floor will more than suffice.
[159:12.75]Better than a wet rock, I suppose.
[159:17.18]My thanks, Quentin.
[159:19.14]Next time you're at the Hideaway, our floor's all yours.
[159:22.85]No need for thanks, Sid.
[159:25.04]This isn't an act of charity.
[159:27.76]You don't say.
[159:28.90]I do like the voice work, though.
[159:29.88]In exchange for my floor, I shall be requiring your services.
[159:34.44]Even, like, the side characters are great.
[159:36.49]...to barricade across the road south when they occupied the village and failed to remove it when they left.
[159:43.27]I expect it to be gone before you leave.
[159:45.15]As you wish.
[160:00.46]Following evening.
[160:01.18]Uh-oh, we're not gonna get... Dude wants a favor for letting somebody sleep on the floor?
[160:06.56]Yeah, what the fuck?
[160:07.36]I know of another shortcut.
[160:09.06]You should be so lucky.
[160:30.62]I have heals, right?
[160:32.14]Yeah, I do.
[160:32.52]I have potions.
[160:33.38]I have three of the high potions over there.
[160:48.17]Oh, yippee.
[160:51.63]I'm going to collect potions, and I'm going to collect materials, and I'm going to get status effects.
[160:57.41]Just you wait.
[160:58.09]Just you wait, Sid.
[161:08.96]If the Royalists were willing to take the care that have posted centuries to prevent any unwelcome surprises, at least I would have.
[161:29.94]Well, you should know.
[161:46.41]Make for Caer Norvind.
[161:52.14]Five bucks?
[161:58.75]Let's go!
[162:22.07]Wait.
[162:24.21]I probably didn't even need to buy the potions now that I'm looking at it.
[162:27.23]Back over here.
[162:27.87]Fight him.
[162:58.66]Two pinches of magic ash.
[163:02.87]Ooh.
[163:03.77]What is this?
[163:04.27]This is like a super chest.
[163:07.47]Did I get a lore check?
[163:17.38]I had to shave.
[163:18.26]Yeah.
[163:21.29]We're going to Kaer Norvind.
[163:23.69]It's an imperial stronghold located along the southern fringes of Sambrikoi's territory, far from its capital of Oriflame.
[163:34.30]Chatter was wondering.
[163:35.42]It occupies a key strategic position adjacent to the Crystal Belt, and it's suitably formidably fortified as a result.
[163:42.40]Within its walls, there are living quarters, a church, a jail, and sufficient storehouses to see the occupants through the lengthy siege.
[163:49.44]Hope you had a good shave.
[163:56.44]Just as a lady said.
[164:01.45]Stay down!
[164:27.96]Are you going to do another Halloween week this year?
[164:32.60]Yeah, of course.
[164:33.52]Play at least a few scary games.
[164:40.13]There's quite a few that have come out.
[164:42.85]Alright, check over here.
[164:58.44]Can't go this way?
[164:59.75]No?
[165:03.33]He won't do it now.
[165:04.21]He just said he would.
[165:05.03]Now he won't do it.
[165:08.21]You should wear a cardigan again for Halloween week.
[165:11.68]Alright, hold on.
[165:12.22]Getting attacked.
[165:14.16]It's over.
[165:33.97]I should have jumped up there.
[165:39.08]Level 14.
[165:52.98]Can you do a -2 stream where you tell bad jokes on purpose?
[165:58.82]We did that three days ago.
[166:00.02]I feel like I do that every other stream.
[166:05.91]My plan for Halloween this year is to get a full, elaborate vampire outfit.
[166:09.43]I'm doing that.
[166:10.07]I'm going to be in character the whole night.
[166:11.43]I'm going to pretend like it's 1100 or something.
[166:14.35]Vampire's brain?
[166:14.71]I don't remember.
[166:32.08]Why would you risk your life?
[166:33.90]Well, they didn't ever.
[166:35.86]When are vampires supposed to exist?
[166:38.14]If anyone ever learned what you've been doing with their property.
[166:41.58]They'd have my head in a box.
[166:43.44]But this isn't just about dominance and bearers.
[166:45.48]It's about all of us.
[166:48.34]What I want is to build a place where it doesn't matter what you are.
[166:53.18]Somebody said 2008.
[166:58.17]Our world isn't ready for a place like that.
[167:04.78]so until it is I use the power I've been given to show people there is hope 1400s okay
[167:38.74]so tell me about this benedicta wear a cardigan as the vampire the best and worst decision I ever made don't underestimate her clive a fight with her icon is not one you're likely to walk away from garuda warden of the wind yeah I've just drank I'll drink like a bottle of wine on stream yeah
[168:12.44]Let's play scary games.
[168:22.95]Okay.
[168:27.34]New location.
[168:36.99]I think this is that part in the demo is that correct this seems like a place for it I think this is the part from the demo yeah it is
[169:05.79]The land has fallen.
[169:10.23]The eastern territories all but belong to the orcs.
[169:14.36]I'll have my men ready to depart by noon.
[169:16.20]Don't bother.
[169:18.68]But what of the mines?
[169:19.94]Without adamantite... A blight would have engulfed the mines ere long.
[169:24.42]Besides, you already have your orders.
[169:29.87]Yes, my liege.
[169:32.47]The dark swallows more of the realm with each passing day, the land starved of the ether that gives it life.
[169:40.25]And as the fringes fade, the people flock to the Mother Crystals, desperate for their blessing.
[169:47.88]The war we wage for possession of that blessing, it breaks us from within, hastening us to our own destruction.
[169:58.10]And so you do what must be done.
[170:01.36]I unite the dominance.
[170:04.00]That we may bring an end to the strife and found a new order to see us unto tomorrow.
[170:12.14]The world must be restored and I will see it so.
[170:16.50]You might have already had Seadolphus not betrayed us.
[170:19.20]Boss fight.
[170:21.62]Him again.
[170:23.20]Lost you still for his embrace.
[170:26.58]But
[170:28.51]Of course not, my liege.
[170:34.11]I serve you, and you alone.
[170:42.05]I remember well the day you first entered these halls.
[170:47.97]Your pale hand pressed into his, as if you would never let go.
[170:52.22]That... that was a long time ago.
[170:57.00]Someone's just like, hey, man, you're going to play Breath of the Wild next week.
[171:04.56]Now and always.
[171:10.16]Soon, my dear.
[171:12.13]Soon all will know whose hand it is that keeps them from falling into the darkness.
[171:20.69]Hold me my leash.
[171:22.73]Never let me go.
[171:36.14]Scared the shit out of me.
[171:37.42]Yes, I have.
[172:08.69]Yeah, this is the demo part.
[172:10.81]Well, the part of the extra demo.
[172:18.56]Yep, this is the same part.
[172:34.38]Headwind.
[172:38.62]That's a nice trick.
[172:41.60]You'll have to teach me sometime.
[172:45.42]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[172:46.20]How do I turn this back on?
[172:47.32]Remember I had to turn the brightness up on my game because I didn't know how to turn it back on.
[172:50.26]I was like, I can't see.
[172:56.73]We should start with the dungeons.
[172:58.49]They may be holding the bearers there.
[173:00.65]Sound plan.
[173:01.91]As long as we keep ourselves on this side of the bus.
[173:06.49]Oh.
[173:07.85]Yep.
[173:09.69]In here.
[173:16.15]They're all empty.
[173:18.27]And you're gonna give up.
[173:24.26]Sid.
[173:25.74]This gate.
[173:26.32]Need some help.
[173:32.94]We just casted a headache curse on me.
[173:35.38]May help you here.
[173:40.04]Should be gone now.
[173:48.71]I did my best.
[173:55.93]You made it worse.
[174:01.75]Bro, you just made me dumber.
[174:11.87]No, you can't even prove that, by the way.
[174:14.47]What, are you in the middle of a math test?
[174:16.91]Now you just don't know how to do it?
[174:21.07]Hi.
[174:22.29]It's kind of loud, I know, but you've got to get pumped up, right?
[174:39.89]You've got to get pumped up.
[174:54.07]Ooh, that was cool.
[174:59.40]I don't know.
[175:06.98]Ask the dog.
[175:10.08]Wait, let me check.
[175:10.70]I don't want to miss anything.
[175:32.91]We can take him.
[175:36.65]We can take him.
[175:39.17]Oh, snap.
[175:39.83]It's the goofy guy I keep seeing on my YouTube feed.
[175:47.08]Welcome to the stream!
[175:54.14]Hope you enjoy your stay!
[176:01.47]Okay, now here's how I actually am.
[176:08.96]Whoa.

[178:02.66]You know what I mean?
[178:03.72]The ones that are like... Dammit.
[178:21.85]They're everywhere.
[178:23.71]let's go this might take a while get them all in the same area the zone is it zero the same zero
[178:46.46]Don't think so You you you're the healer you need to die That was cool Alright, can you heal me because I don't use potions
[179:15.05]I really don't want to use a potion.
[179:16.55]Whatever, I'll use them, fine.
[179:34.45]Oh, bloody hide.
[179:36.89]Bloody fangs.
[179:46.58]Oh, thanks for the... Ow.
[180:14.52]And then one big one and then one of these oh
[180:43.73]There we go.
[180:44.19]You went fast.
[180:47.25]Satisfaction.
[181:26.15]Kill!
[181:30.94]Alright, I need to heal.
[181:57.71]Would you consider yourself a junk food streamer?
[181:59.49]Can you sing Billie Jean?
[182:04.92]That one?
[182:06.30]Oh, do Billie Jean without any emotion at all?
[182:20.59]Sure.
[182:25.93]The alarm!
[182:27.30]All this bloody running!
[182:30.08]After them!
[182:55.33]Well guarded.
[182:56.01]Attacking an opponent from the front while he's guarding will deal no damage.
[183:00.13]Go to the back.
[183:04.83]Yeah, they can break through.
[183:06.33]Yep.
[183:07.77]Okay.
[183:31.87]New enemies approach.
[183:57.44]Alright, four.
[184:01.08]Caster, hold on.
[184:41.37]I'm hungry.
[184:42.21]Well, you should get a snack.
[184:52.39]You didn't even do that.
[184:56.41]Now I did.
[184:59.48]The only way is through the chapel.
[185:01.90]Then Gregor must have planned this for us.
[185:09.52]Don't miss a chest or anything.
[185:10.38]I don't want to... Yeah, see?
[185:11.36]I don't want to miss anything.
[185:21.96]I got some pizza here.
[185:22.96]You want a slice?
[185:24.42]Oh, I'm good.
[185:26.60]What kind of pizza though is it?
[185:28.39]Pepperoni?
[185:43.60]What the hell happened here?
[185:45.30]A little late for prayer, isn't it?
[185:57.80]Do I seem so desperate as to grovel at the feet of a false god?
[186:02.20]It's gonna be much harder because I don't have all the things equipped.
[186:04.59]I was waiting for you.
[186:05.79]All the accessories were on last time.
[186:07.47]Too long, I hope.
[186:10.91]All this for a midnight chat.
[186:15.18]Well, let's chat then.
[186:17.76]Where are the men and women you took from Lostwing?
[186:20.69]You mean, where's the dominant?
[186:22.67]Waluid shall be requiring his services indefinitely.
[186:26.87]Come back to me, Sidulfus.
[186:29.09]I need you.
[186:30.39]Think of all the things we can create together.
[186:34.29]The world that we can build.
[186:36.71]You need me?
[186:39.80]Your king needs me.
[186:41.60]I'm all for building a new world.
[186:44.38]Just not his.
[186:46.10]That bastard's dreams are as twisted as his promises are false.
[186:50.59]And I want no part of them.
[186:52.53]King Barnabas saved you, and this is how you speak of him?
[186:56.55]Have you no shred of loyalty?
[186:59.65]What?
[187:00.75]To a leader who'd use me?
[187:03.58]Like he uses you.
[187:05.68]You know nothing of me, Sidolphus.
[187:08.10]You're right.
[187:09.80]I don't know who you are anymore.
[187:12.54]Or what you want.
[187:15.88]I only know what you used to say.
[187:19.22]That you were tired of running.
[187:21.41]That you just wanted to be free.
[187:24.97]Free of it all.
[187:27.13]You weren't lying to me then, so what changed?
[187:30.59]What made you think you had to sacrifice who you were to get what you wanted?
[187:36.00]Sacrifice.
[187:37.52]I use my talents to my advantage, and you would tell me there is shame in that?
[187:41.48]If there's no shame, then why do you feel so sorry for yourself?
[187:45.75]A rousing speech, Lord Commander.
[187:47.69]I was a fool to believe you might have changed.
[187:52.19]The only person I feel sorry for is you!
[187:55.12]I can't do this anymore.
[188:06.19]What are you gonna do about it?
[188:07.59]I'm back.
[188:08.57]Did I miss anything?
[188:59.81]And don't forget about what I can do.
[189:01.79]I can get rid of your headaches.
[189:06.04]Keep going, Cindy.
[189:08.10]I'll make sure you're clean of all pain in your upper region.
[189:13.96]You are going to wake up with fresh tomorrow.
[189:29.61]It's not gonna hurt.
[189:42.16]I'm just the migraine medicine guy.
[189:43.94]I don't want any part of this.
[189:46.18]I don't even know how to use a sword.
[189:49.54]I uh...
[189:54.87]Watch out.
[190:46.46]Cinematic evasion.
[190:53.92]Oh, they crash into each other.
[190:55.12]I didn't even pick that up last time.
[191:02.77]Get in here!
[191:15.38]Wow Alright, this one's done
[191:49.11]Shit!
[191:49.27]Sorry.
[191:49.59]Okay, I'm getting hurt.
[192:04.30]Shit.
[192:53.98]8k that's not bad Shit
[193:30.40]You look really interesting today.
[193:31.90]I think it's just... I have a beard I haven't shaved.
[193:42.62]Mom instincts kicked in?
[193:49.72]Mom instincts?
[194:07.52]We're not done.
[194:08.14]Does he actually make it?
[194:31.65]In the demo, doesn't it kind of just end?
[194:33.56]Benedicta will be on her way to collect the Dominant, if she hasn't already.
[194:40.27]You can't afford to let them leave.
[194:42.63]Remember, she has wings, you don't.
[194:45.67]What about you?
[194:47.77]Before or after I catch my breath.
[194:50.70]Sorry.
[194:56.76]Ow.
[194:56.92]Come on, Toggle.
[194:59.40]Ow.
[195:08.59]Oh, yeah, he's there at the end of the demo.
[195:12.75]OK.
[195:14.95]Let's keep going.
[195:27.45]Give him a potion.
[195:28.73]Oh, they're mine.
[195:29.25]He had a lot of opportunities.
[195:34.14]To go to the store and buy three high potions just like I did.
[195:39.12]Wait, they might be just over here.
[195:52.59]She must be here somewhere.
[195:56.49]Yeah, I'll just throw this over at her.
[196:06.07]The favor of fire?
[196:07.39]What was that?
[196:07.95]Did I just get something?
[196:14.55]What was that?
[196:23.68]Oh.
[196:35.62]Forget about the defense.
[196:36.36]Let's put these both on.
[196:45.75]I'm going to open the other door that was down here.
[196:46.97]Can you equip the dog too?
[196:55.51]I don't believe so.
[196:58.17]I don't believe so.
[196:59.37]At least not at the moment.
[197:00.43]I'm not sure.
[197:00.77]Maybe later.
[197:10.46]Good.
[197:10.86]Meteorite.
[197:17.91]We want to go this way.
[197:18.91]We need to equip Otto.
[197:36.66]The withdrawal has been signaled.
[197:40.06]Kinda sounded like Homer Simpson.
[197:42.46]Didn't it?
[197:42.78]For like one second.
[197:45.22]I need to get rid of you.
[198:05.60]You too.
[198:06.14]You need to die.
[198:11.88]Ow.
[198:12.18]Good dog.
[198:14.04]Any more, uh...
[198:41.12]She has her trust.
[198:44.37]How do you get over there?
[199:02.23]How do I get over there?
[199:03.85]I'm running out of tower.
[199:10.51]How do I get over there?
[199:20.32]How late he wants us gone before sunrise!
[199:22.12]Good job!
[199:49.19]Ah, this I get to go down from here.
[199:59.59]Is there anywhere else to go?
[200:00.45]I don't think so.
[200:06.29]Can you pronounce something funny?
[200:07.45]Give me a word.
[200:08.83]Give me a word to pronounce.
[200:12.59]Yeah.
[200:28.64]Lobster.
[200:29.76]There you go.
[200:34.85]Oh, hold on.
[200:37.07]Alright, get everybody near the table.
[200:41.68]I didn't hit anybody.
[200:58.24]Shit.
[201:03.73]Oh.
[201:08.67]Who's that?
[201:33.02]My hair's getting in my... Starting to like this game more and more.
[201:43.46]It's just, it's fun to play.
[201:45.42]It's fun to play.
[201:48.74]My mom made macaroni and cheese.
[201:51.07]Pog!
[202:04.04]That fire breathing gets me a little like
[202:44.25]Go!
[203:30.56]What's the first video game you ever played?
[203:36.83]Super Mario Brothers for the NES.
[203:40.89]Super Mario Brothers for the NES.
[203:44.32]Worst game I really ever played.
[203:48.44]Same, yeah.
[203:50.79]I remember because... So, me and my siblings would play, and we were terrible at it.
[203:56.29]You've heard this story before.
[203:57.37]That's lame.
[203:58.88]Alright, time that person up for fucking six weeks.
[204:02.12]Alright, so... I've told this story before.
[204:05.88]So, siblings and I would... So, my dad would be like, all you gotta do, you just get to Bowser with five lives, and I'll beat it.
[204:16.73]He's like, as long as you get to the end of the game, as long as you get to Bowser with at least five lives, I'll beat it.
[204:21.59]And we would be desperately just trying to get to the end of the game with five lives because we couldn't beat Bowser, but he could.
[204:29.74]And he'd be like, Dad, Dad, we got six lives.
[204:32.00]And he'd be like, alright, let me get in there.
[204:35.23]And he'd die like five times in a row, but he would actually do it.
[204:38.43]He would do it every time.
[204:41.51]Yeah.
[204:42.89]Good memories.
[204:47.03]Because my dad knew that if we didn't have at least four or five lives... Uh-oh.
[204:55.73]I don't know if he's confident on doing it.
[205:15.62]Oh, Giga Dad.
[205:17.18]Yeah, we'd be cheering.
[205:22.16]It'd be like, yeah, he did it.
[205:24.16]He beat Bowser.
[205:25.32]And he would just be like, that's right.
[205:26.38]Okay, I'm going to pay attention.
[205:36.67]What door did I not go in?
[205:37.67]I just opened like five doors and I don't know where I'm going.
[205:39.85]Okay, it's this one.
[205:59.48]What are you gonna do?
[206:02.36]You coming?
[206:28.82]How's the job going?
[206:30.42]Starting with off-brand?
[206:31.44]It's going awesome.
[206:34.08]Starting to work on some projects.
[206:35.12]Starting to get some, you know, writing days in.
[206:38.38]It's going great.
[206:38.94]I'm really, really happy.
[206:41.48]Trying to get the workflow.
[206:43.62]You know, different days that I'm going to be doing stuff and meetings.
[206:48.38]Meetings.
[206:49.04]You know, meetings.
[206:51.80]Is Ludwig a good boss?
[206:53.16]Oh yeah.
[206:54.98]I would say Ludwig is a great boss.
[207:02.52]I confess I expected more from the old man.
[207:10.00]And less from you.
[207:11.88]This is the second time you've bested my sisters.
[207:16.57]Men of your talents are rare indeed.
[207:18.57]Did you get a new planner?
[207:19.45]Why fast your lot with such undesirables?
[207:22.07]If it is the hearth you long for.
[207:23.87]I got a planner.
[207:24.59]You'll find more than enough warmth under my wings.
[207:29.42]You know exactly what I want.
[207:32.52]Hand over the dominant and I'll leave you in peace.
[207:36.43]You would dare to make demands of me.
[207:41.25]Know your place, little lamb.
[207:44.57]Fool is a shepherd who heats every bleed of the flock.
[207:49.85]And I will suffer yours no longer.
[207:52.96]Must I spell it out for you?
[207:57.22]See how the chief creative officer of Offbrand does in this boss battle.
[208:06.65]Come, little lamb, to the slaughter with you.
[208:11.24]You brought it up.
[208:12.22]I'm just... Let's go.
[208:15.46]Not this time.
[208:24.03]Scream for me.
[208:28.57]Yeah!
[208:37.00]That hurt a lot.
[209:07.60]Oh I don't have anything!
[209:36.18]Headache on!
[210:28.86]No Cry all you like there's no one to save you now.
[210:37.97]Oh
[210:47.66]Oh, that hurt!
[211:25.74]Just charge it charge charge it
[211:51.34]Hold up 3k that's nothing
[212:22.44]You disgust me.
[212:23.32]Not this time.
[212:24.45]Time to join your pet.
[212:50.80]Ramble ball.
[212:56.06]I always press the L1.
[212:56.85]Kog'o!
[213:31.81]Don't touch me!
[213:36.86]I'm nothing!
[213:46.04]Too slow.
[213:47.75]No!
[213:48.31]No!
[213:59.88]Oh shit, what does this mean?
[215:01.62]deadly embrace.
[215:06.04]I will say it's much more difficult without the accessories on.
[215:12.80]Come on, dog!
[215:26.53]Let's get her.
[215:51.44]I'll kill you!
[215:52.88]I'll kill you both!
[216:49.37]Get him, Torkel!
[216:49.91]Get her!
[216:50.31]Oh shit, I'm in a combo!
[216:57.56]There, boy!
[217:16.87]Okay, we're good.
[217:25.36]That fight was crazy.
[217:33.92]So this is as far as we've seen.
[217:38.63]You are but a branded.
[217:40.43]I, I, ow.
[217:45.81]How did you do it?
[217:48.03]How did you even survive?
[217:49.79]How?
[217:51.43]The answer is simple, Benedicta.
[217:54.65]He was fighting for something he believed.
[217:56.86]What's the difficulty?
[217:57.58]Shut up!
[217:58.92]The action.
[217:59.38]There's two difficulties.
[218:00.66]This story and action.
[218:03.04]We've played your games.
[218:05.44]I'm on action.
[218:06.16]Tell me where he is.
[218:08.52]Who?
[218:10.82]What are you?
[218:26.10]What are you doing?
[218:57.17]Why?
[218:57.37]Why did you do that?
[218:58.27]What the fuck?
[219:25.95]enough of this I took it now you really are only useful at birthday parties she she's gone what's happening
[219:59.41]Give her back!
[220:01.47]Give her back!
[220:03.10]Give her back!
[220:04.96]My lady!
[220:10.60]Where is she?
[220:12.22]Where is Garuda?
[220:12.90]What have you done to me?
[220:20.47]What have you done?
[220:33.89]What the hell is going on?
[220:47.34]Her power, you took it from her.
[220:52.76]How'd you do that?
[220:53.64]I'll take yours too.
[220:56.47]If you don't cut the shit.
[220:59.09]That magical purple electricity.
[221:01.03]I hope the bear has found a way out.
[221:03.63]Cool.
[221:06.67]What the hell is going on?
[221:08.22]I thought that was us for a second.
[221:09.90]We did not make it.
[221:10.80]We didn't make it.
[221:31.59]Oh boy, that's bad.
[221:32.73]That's a bad thing for us to cut into being killed.
[221:35.81]Cutscene isn't over.
[221:39.39]Facecam boy.
[222:21.00]Oh, look.
[222:22.12]Morning has broken.
[222:27.78]And here come the cavalry.
[222:29.46]Itching to butcher the bastards who made them miss their morning gruel.
[222:32.88]Yeah, I can do some upgrades.
[222:33.97]I have a lot of points.
[222:34.91]Come on.
[222:36.03]If they catch us leaving a burning care, people might jump to conclusions.
[222:41.23]Right.
[222:45.49]Wings of Change.
[222:51.00]How come you remove facecam for cutscenes?
[222:53.67]It makes it easier to pay attention to.
[222:56.19]The power of wind, Clive has claimed a portion of the icon Garuda's essence.
[223:07.03]Tuning with Garuda not only changes the elemental aspect of Clive's magic spells, but also allows access to several new iconic abilities such as gouge.
[223:15.75]deadly flurry of talons that can tear into an opponent for multiple hits.
[223:21.35]Ability details can be found in the Abilities tab in the main menu.
[223:25.22]Garuda's Feat.
[223:26.38]Garuda's iconic feat, Deadly Embrace, can be used to draw smaller, lighter enemies toward Clive.
[223:33.39]The action can also topple larger enemies and that, you know, become partially staggered when their will gauge reaches 50%.
[223:41.26]Toppling an enemy in this manner can deal significant damage, so use it wisely.
[223:46.59]This is called Deadly Embrace, by the way.
[223:49.45]Okay.
[223:57.97]Press L2 to cycle between currently attuned icons in real time, allowing for more varied assault.
[224:05.07]Cooldown times for iconic abilities are displayed around the corresponding icon in the Ability widget.
[224:09.81]Ability availability for all attuned icons can be confirmed.
[224:12.48]Okay.
[224:15.78]Let me go like this.
[224:23.45]So I have deadly embraces this like I can feel it.
[224:27.49]It's I'm back inside me.
[224:31.57]Along with the flames.
[224:32.43]Gouge and wicked wheel.
[224:33.75]Well, I'm not keen to try it out.
[224:37.03]Of course, I want to try it out.
[224:42.87]Of course, I want to try it out.
[224:43.79]Let's try it on these people.
[224:45.51]Stop this.
[224:46.89]Where did you come from?
[225:05.03]pretty cool mm-hmm mm-hmm
[225:29.95]Come here!
[225:30.75]What do you got?
[225:55.48]That's not gonna help you.
[226:00.78]Hey, I think you'd like the Final Fantasy XVI battle theme.
[226:08.13]I think so!
[226:08.59]Thank God you have CC now.
[226:22.28]It's helpful.
[226:23.62]The pole is helpful.
[226:33.91]I've got a big dragon thing here Yeah
[226:58.22]Oh my goodness!
[226:58.72]Oh my god, I forgot how to play!
[227:13.25]That'll help.
[227:17.52]What is the actual default magic with this leg?
[227:20.34]Pretty cool.
[227:47.98]7k.
[228:08.57]You watch the Smurfs movie yet?
[228:09.57]Nope.
[228:11.13]I will.
[228:11.59]I will this weekend.
[228:17.92]You have Lego hair?
[228:18.68]That's fine.
[228:21.38]I don't want to move it because it'll... Yeah, I don't want to touch it.
[228:28.88]If I touch it, I screw it up.
[228:33.30]I need to go upgrade my weapon.
[228:40.14]I have materials to upgrade this.
[228:46.81]Don't just avoid all the items.
[228:52.39]Five bucks.
[228:59.58]Okay, let's take a look.
[229:02.68]Abilities.
[229:05.16]Garuda channeled.
[229:06.26]Alright, this is where I got to figure out what I want to do.
[229:13.15]Because there's at least three plus icons in the game.
[229:16.49]There's at least three.
[229:22.37]What is this one?
[229:23.03]I don't know.
[229:30.40]I like the pole.
[229:37.88]I like the slashes.
[229:39.30]It's gouge.
[229:52.45]This is good too.
[229:56.61]What's down here?
[230:00.41]I use this a lot.
[230:02.73]I use this a lot.
[230:04.87]I use this a lot.
[230:11.39]I use this a lot.
[230:14.15]Does the pole just upgrade the damage?
[230:15.45]That's a good question.
[230:20.48]Range.
[230:24.92]Looks like range.
[230:30.61]Range is pretty good.
[230:32.75]I'll go with this.
[230:33.43]I like this one.
[230:38.43]Follow-up strike speed.
[230:39.45]Cool.
[230:41.27]Ooh.
[230:47.71]jump back then deliver a punishing counter if the jump evades an attack counter potency is increased so is this just a regular dodge just but backwards and then I press I how do I how do I do the move or is it a new move I'm upgrading this I use it all the time
[231:21.31]Ooh.
[231:26.22]Alright, what do I got?
[231:32.52]Is it a different ability?
[231:39.25]It is.
[231:39.79]Okay.
[231:44.57]I would probably replace this.
[231:50.19]So I really want to try to evade with this thing.
[231:54.07]So you want to go, wham.
[231:56.45]And if you get a perfect evade, it's way way better.
[231:58.35]What's a cooldown?
[232:01.23]Hmm.
[232:04.35]It's very pretty.
[232:04.93]It is very pretty.
[232:13.34]I want to practice that move.
[232:17.74]Cool stream.
[232:18.16]Can you do this in IRL?
[232:20.22]Wait, Gav is here.
[232:21.44]I didn't know Gav was going to show up.
[232:25.38]I'm going to stop talking.
[232:51.62]So if it wasn't you or him who freed the bearers, who was it?
[232:55.83]Good question.
[232:57.01]Someone who didn't have their hands full fighting a bloody half withyer, I guess.
[233:00.99]But what matters is they're safe.
[233:04.89]Something they wouldn't be had it not been for you, Gav.
[233:09.14]Ah, just doing me job like.
[233:12.54]So, uh, what about his dominant?
[233:16.36]Gone.
[233:17.60]And after we were so close.
[233:21.90]I'm biting my lip off camera.
[233:25.62]I know.
[233:25.76]You would be scolding me if you knew it.
[233:28.88]I reckon he likes you.
[233:59.50]She's gone.
[234:01.48]My lady, you have to hold on.
[234:03.04]We're going to get you.
[234:09.55]What am I going to do?
[234:10.47]Barnabas!
[234:13.13]How long to to the coastal road?
[234:17.37]At this pace, we won't make it by sunset.
[234:19.45]He'll know.
[234:21.84]He'll cast me out like all the others.
[234:25.02]What am I going to do?
[234:28.18]Just pretend you still have it.
[234:29.06]Oh my god.
[234:31.18]What the fuck?
[234:32.94]Oh my god.
[234:36.25]I was... I was waiting to see what that guy's story was, but we're not gonna get it anymore.
[234:41.81]I thought that was gonna be a major boss battle, but no, he's just gone.
[234:54.15]Goodbye.
[234:59.80]Geroff.
[235:01.54]Second in command of Wayload's Royal Intelligencers, serving under Benedicta Harmon.
[235:07.63]Killed by footpads while attempting to evacuate the stricken Benedicta from the collapsing... We just got... This is just what happened to him.
[235:17.37]Right now.
[235:19.00]This is the eulogy?
[235:21.78]This is like the two sentences of what just happened to this guy.
[235:30.54]Wiki page updated.
[235:32.06]That's so funny.
[235:38.47]What does this one say?
[235:39.33]Huh?
[235:43.65]No more powers.
[235:49.65]Her love for former Lord Commander Cid was deep and true and left an equally abyssal hole in her heart when he fled Wayload.
[236:00.53]Just pretend you still have the powers.
[236:02.31]Who's going to question you?
[236:30.78]It's alright.
[236:33.24]They can't hurt you anymore.
[236:36.46]Come on.
[236:45.20]Let's go home.
[236:53.74]Is this it, Siddolfus?
[236:58.06]My punishment for not listening to you?
[237:09.47]Still got power?
[237:18.96]It all deserves to die!
[237:25.40]It all deserves to die!
[237:27.80]Die!
[237:28.28]Die!
[237:28.54]Die!
[237:54.32]Huh?
[238:03.38]Do we not have the power?
[238:08.43]Sid.
[238:11.58]Do you feel it too?
[238:14.88]Garuda.
[238:21.34]By the flames.
[238:27.00]She's drawn in too much ether.
[238:30.97]She can't control it.
[238:41.57]Yeah.
[238:41.73]Best character in the whole franchise.
[239:10.05]okay that's all you have to say that's the only thing you have to say is I I don't care we're going okay
[239:39.42]What is this?
[239:48.12]I'm just trying to get items.
[239:51.95]Pretty bloody fangs.
[239:52.57]Alright, let's go.
[240:13.05]Yeah Oh, that looks good I'm always late on that one
[240:51.93]Everybody in.
[240:58.74]Have you learned the parry system?
[241:00.68]I have, but I'm a dodge Andy and I'm way more comfortable dodging frame invulnerability framing than I am parry.
[241:14.54]Cool that you can do it though.
[242:02.16]Understandable.
[242:02.80]Have a nice day.
[242:04.28]What?
[242:05.68]Have a nice day, I guess.
[242:09.87]Parry is hard in this game.
[242:10.91]It did feel like it was tricky to pull off.
[242:24.25]Not this time.
[242:43.63]Get him, boys!
[243:01.37]Ooh, that was, like, perfect.
[243:06.40]Wait, there's an item right here.
[243:09.70]How long is the game?
[243:11.20]Um, that's a good question.
[243:15.29]I want to say probably... I don't think anyone's beaten it.
[243:19.81]It came out today.
[243:20.67]Okay.
[243:42.44]Let me try doing this move see if I can get it perfect Not quite
[244:03.41]Sick of Torgl.
[244:19.08]Sick of Torgl.
[244:21.42]There, we finally got to hear it.
[244:23.87]I wanted to get the item that was over here.
[244:30.18]Can you do that thing with your face?
[244:31.38]What do you want to do?
[244:33.96]This?
[244:43.65]Yeah.
[244:44.43]Thanks, dude.
[245:26.15]You look really sloppy today.
[245:27.25]I was no, I wasn't gonna do something weird.
[245:37.51]I feel like I'm having a dream watching this.
[245:39.29]Why does I have a beard?
[245:49.42]Oh, one of these things.
[245:56.24]Who the hell are you?
[245:57.70]Who the hell are you?
[245:59.78]He's in the...
[246:18.32]I feel like this is going to be a pretty... This is going to be a milestone of the video game, I think, coming up here.
[246:25.43]I am going to go back.
[246:28.92]Because I think it's time to upgrade.
[246:46.56]Detour Danny.
[246:49.91]I mean, yeah, I'm not gonna go with just broken up shit weapons.
[247:01.13]What do we got?
[247:03.47]There's now a bastard sword.
[247:04.97]So sell the bastard- sell the longsword, buy the bastard sword.
[247:16.84]And then upgrade the Bastard Sword.
[247:17.94]It's a good sword for you.
[247:25.15]It's okay to be scared of birds.
[247:31.14]I love birds.
[247:33.20]You know how badly I've wanted a bird to land on my finger?
[247:37.45]You know how much I want that?
[247:39.97]There's hummingbirds all over Vegas.
[247:41.97]They're everywhere.
[247:43.75]And I would like nothing more than to be able to put my hand out and just Disney fucking princess have one land on my finger.
[247:50.27]Do you understand how important that is to me?
[247:53.54]Do you not know how important that would be to me?
[247:56.06]It'd be a huge deal.
[247:57.30]It would change my whole life.
[247:58.10]That would be life-changing.
[247:59.02]That would change my entire life.
[248:04.42]I ain't gonna hear anybody tell me I'm afraid of birds, okay?
[248:11.18]Do you even try?
[248:11.84]Yeah, I have.
[248:16.66]Do you know how many times I've thought like, wait, is today the day?
[248:21.34]Is today the day?
[248:22.06]Because be outside and you'll hear them.
[248:26.29]You'll hear... They sound like massive hornets.
[248:30.59]So for the first spot, you have to be really aware of it.
[248:33.88]I have hummingbirds have been like, just kind of just hovering in front of me before.
[248:39.98]And it's just like, and they're gone.
[248:53.36]I just like did, I just did the guy's voice for one second.
[249:02.21]Jeez.
[249:03.91]We alright?
[249:04.49]We good?
[249:04.71]Yeah, you know how many times I've been just... I'm just imagining one landing and just doing this, doing this.
[249:13.01]You know what I'm saying?
[249:14.17]This.
[249:17.90]You know what I mean?
[249:18.54]Like, who are you?
[249:19.58]Who are you?
[249:19.94]Who are you?
[249:20.98]Who are you?
[249:21.36]I'm just like, you're looking at me.
[249:23.56]I know when you turn your head to the side, you're looking at me.
[249:29.67]You would be a toucan, definitely.
[249:31.76]What a cool bird.
[249:32.94]What an amazing bird.
[249:34.80]That sounds awesome.
[249:36.38]What a cool... Oh, dude, you'd be a toucan.
[249:40.36]That's fucking cool.
[249:41.50]What a cool animal that is.
[249:50.43]Your webcam looks really crusty today.
[249:52.27]I think I look crusty.
[249:53.45]You just don't want to say that.
[249:55.31]Alright, I'm buying the bastard sword.
[250:01.93]You'll not find a better price than that.
[250:03.77]And I'm going to sell.
[250:04.41]And what do you want?
[250:07.77]Go on then.
[250:08.51]I'm going to sell the long sword.
[250:10.95]And then upgrade the bastard sword.
[250:15.69]I reckon I can find a buyer.
[250:22.75]Well.
[250:23.01]120.
[250:25.79]Alright, so it was the right idea.
[250:31.02]it lost you a good while oops well now I have two my best work but it will do that it I'm fine I was like it's alright I got 130 damage now better than what I have before
[250:58.40]I guess I can... No, Torgl doesn't have an inventory.
[251:03.90]I love this down here.
[251:06.08]This is great.
[251:09.67]Doesn't seem to have an inventory.
[251:16.23]This seems like it can be upgraded, though.
[251:17.59]Okay, actually, let me... There's probably better stuff to put on.
[251:31.20]I see I'm busy here.
[251:33.06]What do you want?
[251:36.16]Dark sash.
[251:45.73]Steel crowns.
[251:48.79]This is way better than what I have right now.
[251:52.66]No scratches, right?
[251:57.66]Yeah, that should do you.
[252:01.79]Um.
[252:03.31]Iron belt.
[252:04.87]Can't do.
[252:05.31]I'll put dark sash on.
[252:08.23]Alright, make sure it's on.
[252:12.54]Bastard sword +2.
[252:15.52]Uh, yeah.
[252:16.92]And then steel crowns OK.
[252:19.16]Now let me sell this other stuff.
[252:24.14]I actually do it is different.
[252:27.42]Didn't look different from my my mind.
[252:33.39]Yes.
[252:34.63]What?
[252:36.29]Go on, then.
[252:37.05]Hey, I crafted it and made money.
[252:41.74]That's how I see it.
[252:44.28]I'm thankful you got that much.
[252:48.50]I reckon I can find a buyer.
[252:50.02]I don't want to sell any of these.
[253:00.59]Not buying potions either.
[253:04.00]Alright, I'm good.
[253:06.42]Let's continue with what we're doing.
[253:13.65]New weapon, upgraded.
[253:15.23]Let's go.
[253:20.66]You'd be a screeching owl?
[253:45.66]Oh, that's what we saw when we were.
[253:47.24]OK.
[253:51.78]What's that?
[253:55.29]The dominant.
[253:56.75]The man who killed my brother.
[253:59.19]Are you absolutely certain?
[254:02.67]I've seen him every night for the past 13 years.
[254:05.39]I was under the impression that we did that flames of his icon took Joshua.
[254:10.16]Now.
[254:13.34]I thought if we did that.
[254:14.30]I'm here and souls Togo.
[254:19.60]Don't worry about maybe not.
[254:21.61]To be waiting for this go sick.
[254:39.58]Lost our party members.
[254:43.10]Awakening.
[254:43.62]Yeah.
[255:40.03]That was shit.
[255:40.67]Oh, do I have to dodge?

[257:40.38]Whoa!
[257:45.11]Holy shit, that hurt.
[258:06.44]Take down.
[258:07.24]Larger enemies will become partially staggered when their will gauges are reduced to 50%.
[258:12.76]Using Garuda's deadly embrace on a partially staggered enemy will topple it, leaving it vulnerable to follow-up attacks.
[258:19.45]Okay.
[258:23.19]So, deadly embrace.
[258:25.89]I don't even have that equipped.
[258:29.29]Oh, yes I do.

[261:16.83]That hurt.
[261:50.01]Goodbye.
[262:25.14]Oh, it's over.
[262:34.20]Pause.
[262:35.93]Damn.
[262:39.57]That was cool.
[262:41.85]Music's... Honestly, music's probably my favorite part.
[262:46.61]There's so many different ups and downs.
[262:48.25]There's so many different... Yeah, it's great.
[262:52.57]55 things came out of that.
[263:05.07]Dude, I have to show you what they put in ModCon.
[263:07.05]It is fucking crazy.
[263:12.51]Some of these are fucking insane.
[263:15.92]Like, what even is this supposed to be?
[263:19.08]I'm gonna... Hold on.
[263:19.92]Just watch the cutscene.
[263:20.60]I don't want to fuck this up because this is, like, insane.
[263:34.96]Wait, oh.
[263:38.13]You're nothing.
[263:42.41]Monster.

[264:21.59]Yeah.
[264:53.65]It's an emote now Oh shit I think this is gonna be a big deal
[265:14.01]Alright, that's really funny, but I need to pay attention.
[265:22.82]No way do I get to play like this.
[265:26.10]You do, okay.
[265:28.52]Ifrit.
[265:30.42]Melee ranged and evade.
[265:35.29]Charge an enemy covering great distances in a short period of time, as well as dealing damage if the enemy is struck.
[265:41.78]All abilities available while embodying Ifrit can be obtained and confirmed in the abilities tab.
[265:46.66]Let's go.
[265:55.17]Monster battle time.
[266:04.61]Oh, that was good.
[266:13.92]85,000 damage.
[266:14.34]Punch!

[269:17.80]Oh shit.
[269:18.38]Okay Holy shit
[269:43.54]Sid right now is down on the ground floor.
[269:46.44]This is like.
[269:50.24]I can't do any of that shit.
[269:53.24]Gonna be up to you for the rest of the game.
[270:00.95]I thought lightning was cool, not really.
[270:11.45]And we're both growing back.
[270:26.59]This is awesome, but... Oh, am I ripping the arms?
[271:03.02]hellfire hellfire hellfire that uh that sequence took like four months to animate that was crazy
[271:33.73]That was really cool.
[271:36.41]Wind shard.
[271:36.99]Is there anymore or is that it?
[272:04.44]Oh, here we go again.
[272:28.92]But he's not going to activate into a... No, he's not, right?
[272:32.84]Are we doing this again?
[272:46.10]What the fuck is going on in this game?
[272:50.00]What?
[272:55.57]It's like a giant wizard.
[273:01.16]Ha ha ha!
[273:32.51]Had to shrink back down to.
[273:43.46]You're too nice is your problem.
[273:46.44]Tells you to quit it, dude, yeah.
[273:50.80]Bloody mess this.
[274:03.00]Okay, well, so... Do I... Can I get electricity out of my hands powers eventually?
[274:08.99]Because that's what I'm into.
[274:12.41]Lore check, please.
[274:20.68]The Warden of the Wind, who Benedicta transformed into during her ill-fated flight from the Empire, takes the form of a fearful harpy, summoning storms and tearing into the flesh of its prey with hawk-like talons.
[274:34.96]Such is the Icon's frenzy for destruction that even allies of the Dominant of the Day are wont to... And let's try that again.
[274:45.11]For destruction that even allies of the dominant of the day are wont to begin fleeting the battlefield when dark clouds gather over it.
[274:52.22]Wait, am I reading this wrong?
[274:57.26]Am I reading this wrong?
[274:58.26]I feel like, why can I not read this right?
[275:03.75]Well, that happened.
[275:05.53]Alright, well, I love how it's like, um, you have like ten notifications about Sadolphus, you have a lot of notifications, he's been DMing you about his fucking wizard form.
[275:18.80]Mm.
[275:23.08]Mm-hmm.
[275:24.54]Mm.
[275:26.42]Mm.
[275:28.28]Mm.
[275:31.40]Mm.
[275:33.60]Mm.
[275:33.70]Mm.
[275:35.33]Mm-hmm.
[275:37.33]Christ.
[275:44.39]This fucking picture is ridiculous.
[275:50.29]Who even made this?
[275:52.54]I'm going to try to look like that.
[275:57.36]I'm going to just grove everything.
[275:58.66]Just turn the camera on one day.
[275:59.90]I'm going to look like this.
[276:05.76]And there has to be a part during one of that stream where I laugh like this.
[276:15.29]And my teeth, my teeth are like black.
[276:34.56]Why?
[276:37.06]Why did you have to listen to him?
[276:38.56]Banner.
[276:45.26]Dad.
[277:39.19]Well, sometime later, how much later is this?
[277:51.00]Who the fuck is this?
[277:52.72]Who is this?
[277:53.84]That horse is giant.
[277:54.98]Oh, my God.
[277:55.60]He is bold and desperate.
[278:02.36]Will you engage him personally, your highness?
[278:06.88]Am I going to engage him personally?
[278:08.78]Of course I'm going to turn into a giant whale.
[278:11.58]You don't think I have the giant dolphin power?
[278:14.52]You know who the fuck you're talking to?
[278:20.12]Yep.
[278:37.53]A new music track too!
[279:28.29]Am I going to have to fight all these things eventually?
[279:31.59]Let's go.
[279:52.76]Precision.
[279:53.28]Yeah.
[279:55.06]Reform the cohorts.
[279:56.73]At once.
[280:07.78]your highness I can't get over I can't get over the Jerma that drank the chaos potion you know I've got powers but I'm all up now saboteurs their attacks are frequent and widespread even in the holy capital the capital what of my father his radiance is safe but he has ordered the city guard strengthened we can expect no reinforcements
[280:36.45]That was cool.
[280:36.77]No, I don't want to lore check.
[280:38.10]I don't want to spoil myself anything.
[281:18.68]It was me.
[281:24.64]I killed Joshua.
[281:31.05]You plan on streaming the whole game?
[281:34.13]Let's figure that out.
[281:36.33]I'm going to ask you that very question.
[281:38.31]Ah, you're awake.
[281:41.66]Because I really like it.
[281:42.42]I would.
[281:43.78]Yeah, just full of surprises.
[281:45.25]I think it's fun.
[281:46.09]First that trick with Garuda, then whatever the hell that other thing was.
[281:52.61]Didn't know you had it in you.
[281:56.99]Do it.
[281:59.07]Hey.
[282:01.63]Kill me.
[282:04.79]It was me.
[282:07.41]I killed him.
[282:09.25]I killed Joshua!
[282:11.01]I killed them all!
[282:12.85]I'm a monster!
[282:15.04]And I deserve to die!
[282:18.48]So end it!
[282:20.18]End it now!
[282:22.06]Please!
[282:23.14]Please!
[282:31.84]I reckon I can take you.
[282:33.94]If that's what you want.
[282:37.72]But first...
[282:39.43]I thought I'd give you the benefit of my timeless wisdom.
[282:47.19]It seems to me that since you're still breathing, you might as well make yourself useful.
[282:53.84]I don't know about that.
[282:56.84]Get dressed.
[282:58.34]Pretty as you are, you're not my type.
[283:06.28]I'll see you in the hall.
[283:09.72]I don't know.
[283:10.14]I have uncontrollable demon rage.
[283:16.50]He's a cool wizard, but, I mean... Gigantic demon.
[283:25.75]I think I can win.
[283:43.50]He just beat you.
[283:45.08]Yeah, but I wasn't prepared.
[283:46.50]What are you going to do now?
[283:47.64]Plus, I was fighting Garuda, who was also one of these icons.
[283:58.07]Wages of guilt.
[284:02.67]There are certain times during the game that side quests will become temporarily unavailable until progress has been made through the main scenario.
[284:09.18]Okay, so I have to focus on the main story.
[284:14.92]Hello, Doug.
[284:34.40]I think I'm just going to upgrade if I can.
[284:36.72]What is that?
[284:39.94]Okay, this one's purple.
[284:46.57]Stormcry.
[284:47.29]That's way cooler than the Bastard Sword.
[284:53.29]Does it have any properties on it, or is it just...
[285:05.68]I'm gonna get it.
[285:06.26]No scratches, right?
[285:13.92]Can't reinforce it.
[285:17.51]Anything else?
[285:18.75]Ooh.
[285:21.99]Cool looking.
[285:23.29]Can I buy anything from you here?
[285:29.56]Look what the curl dragged in.
[285:32.08]Coin purse weighing you down?
[285:38.43]Mmm.
[285:42.43]This is just better.
[285:44.08]Come again.
[285:44.90]Can I make anything new besides the source?
[285:46.88]I'm not much bothered either way.
[285:48.28]Like it quick.
[286:11.76]What am I wearing for a belt right now?
[286:17.82]This one, right?
[286:20.36]+2.
[286:22.08]I need a plus one, but don't I already... Oh, I have a +2.
[286:25.00]I just can't upgrade anymore past +2.
[286:29.45]Okay.
[286:30.33]Well, I have the new weapon.
[286:31.09]That's all that matters.
[286:37.13]Can we get a Paul in chat?
[286:39.55]Odin and Bahamut.
[286:40.84]That's it by all accounts.
[286:41.94]Do you want me to continue to stream Final Fantasy 16?
[286:44.12]It would probably be on the chill nights.
[286:47.26]Probably turn the cam off.
[286:50.46]Play it and just hang out.
[286:51.80]What do you think?
[286:52.34]Get a poll?
[286:56.15]I really like it.
[286:56.89]So I'm going to play it regardless.
[286:58.87]So I'm either going to turn it on and just play it for fun.
[287:02.35]Just chilling out on stream.
[287:04.21]Or I'm just going to play this with my mouth open on the couch.
[287:11.81]That has to be 85% at least since you gave that same number to Strawberry Magic.
[287:17.55]Strawberry Magic is not Final Fantasy 16.
[287:22.75]Final Fantasy 16 is a little different than Strawberry Magic was.
[287:25.81]I would say.
[287:27.88]I think that's a little different.
[287:36.00]I mean, if most people are into it, then I'll keep playing it.
[287:39.42]I mean, that's pretty overwhelming.
[287:41.26]That seems like it was 90%.
[287:45.42]Yeah, I'll just stream it more.
[287:52.75]I'm going to do this next mission, and then I'm probably going to call it.
[287:55.49]So, whatever happens at the end of this, that'll be it for tonight.
[287:58.07]And I'll see you on Saturday.
[288:00.29]The sponsor is obviously Square Enix sponsored the stream, but I kind of kept going.
[288:04.18]Um...
[288:08.34]Very, very fun.
[288:08.76]You still have a bit of fight left in you?
[288:10.60]Then listen.
[288:11.96]I've arranged a meeting with Gav.
[288:14.12]In case you've forgotten, you're the one he's been putting his nose to work for.
[288:17.68]What are you going to do with the demos?
[288:19.02]For nothing.
[288:22.20]Ah, Saturday.
[288:23.28]Just listen.
[288:24.92]While you've been relaxing in your cell, Gav's been busy sniffing out your dominance.
[288:28.62]Gav.
[288:29.38]And according to his last report, he's picked up a scent.
[288:32.58]Gav's gone through a fair bit of trouble for you.
[288:35.03]The least you can do is hear the poor bugger out.
[288:38.41]He's gone to meet us at the Kings.
[288:39.68]Yes, we'll play sorcery on Saturday and we'll do some Steam demos.
[288:45.11]And then after that, after Saturday, I'll probably come back to this and just play.
[288:48.94]But yeah, Square Enix, thanks for the sponsor.
[288:51.10]The game's great.
[288:53.92]It's out on PS5 right now.
[288:56.40]It came out literally today.
[288:58.82]It's very good.
[289:00.71]The demo is available.
[289:01.85]You can just get the demo and play it if you want right now.
[289:04.09]You've seen it already, but if you want to check it out, maybe see if it's for you.
[289:06.75]I think it's great.
[289:08.89]I'm having a lot of fun.
[289:09.61]I'm going to continue to play it.
[289:10.33]I'm going to keep streaming it.
[289:13.07]But for now, let's finish up this last mission, and then I will call it and see you Saturday.
[289:24.27]I don't think I need any other items.
[289:32.55]We waited 295 days for half a stream of sorcery.
[289:41.38]Dude, you're a booger streamer?
[289:48.38]You're not just getting half a stream of sorcery.
[289:50.50]You're getting us getting back into sorcery.
[289:54.56]Plus, you're getting... I'm going to do voices.
[290:03.79]Jerma does voices, right?
[290:04.97]It's so funny when Jerma does voices.
[290:09.03]You'll get at least two or three different tones.
[290:11.21]And two or three different pitches.
[290:13.83]Someone's going to sound like this.
[290:15.53]Isn't that cool?
[290:16.79]Isn't that weird?
[290:18.81]And just like that, it was deserted.
[290:22.23]Making it the perfect little shortcut.
[290:25.67]Gab's waiting for us up ahead.
[290:26.99]And I'll do the dinosaur quiz.
[290:28.25]What dinosaur are you?
[290:37.08]Still feeling sorry for yourself?
[290:43.21]Yeah, for those of you that didn't know, I know we talked about it a few times, but you liked Final Fantasy XIV.
[291:13.43]The producer and director of Final Fantasy XIV is the producer of this game.
[291:22.29]I know that a lot of people really like that game, so... We obviously got the Death May Cry.
[291:30.82]Yoshi-P, Yoshi-P, yep.
[291:40.24]Yoshi-P is a legend.
[291:46.09]Yeah, I honestly, I... This is... Hold on, I'll wait till he's done talking.
[291:54.54]I was never really into Final Fantasy.
[291:57.60]I was a big... I liked the old ones, but I didn't really pay that much attention past like six or seven, really.
[292:05.91]This is good.
[292:06.63]This is really good.
[292:08.75]I'm very happy with it so far.
[292:14.69]Oh, there's giant enemy spiders.
[292:45.28]I have a follow-up to that, don't I?
[292:46.78]Get him, boy!
[293:19.13]Ooh!
[293:29.89]Cool.
[293:37.32]Yeah, the composer and sound director of Final Fantasy XIV.
[293:40.95]That's Soken.
[293:42.57]Don't know.
[293:43.85]Also on this game.
[293:45.59]Somebody said this is like a dream team for Final Fantasy.
[293:49.11]Which... That's really cool.
[293:56.88]What now?
[294:09.53]Is that a Minotaur?
[294:15.54]It is a Minotaur.
[294:17.64]Alright, let's go.
[294:43.32]Pull him down.
[294:52.87]Oh.
[294:54.31]I'm alive.
[294:54.97]I'm alive.
[294:55.53]I'm alive.
[294:56.07]I'm alive.
[294:56.57]I'm alive.
[295:47.14]That was perfect
[295:54.41]Oh!
[295:55.03]Cooldown.
[295:55.51]Uh-oh.
[295:57.87]I did not time that right.
[295:59.45]Alright, don't blow it here.
[296:01.90]Don't blow it.
[296:03.14]Don't blow it.
[296:29.41]There we go.
[296:43.08]If you do toggle buttons mid-dodge, you'll get precision.
[296:51.07]Cool.
[296:57.18]That Torgal oil will get a riot.
[296:58.74]I already have... I love how we're just kind of like, yeah.
[297:06.11]I need the heal.
[297:07.21]Potion.
[297:07.59]I need way more of those.
[297:29.95]He's never going to check the lore ever again.
[297:32.03]The Hooded Man.
[297:42.30]A mysterious man that many believed to be a dominant of fire.
[297:47.58]Clive first saw him at Phoenix Gate on the night of the Imperial invasion and for years believed him to be the dominant of the icon that killed his brother.
[297:56.66]But to Clive's eternal
[298:00.70]Chagrin, he has proved otherwise.
[298:03.19]Three bloody hides.
[298:47.68]What does that mean?
[298:53.20]Ooh, that's a good move.
[299:32.63]Awesome music.
[299:35.73]I just keep biting my lip.
[299:37.09]And it's gonna cause me stress.
[299:45.37]Still making little clay guys?
[299:47.65]I actually haven't in a little while.
[299:50.21]But... I'll get back into it.
[300:00.05]Another minotaur.
[300:02.83]Okay, well, I beat one.
[300:04.03]I could beat the other.
[300:04.90]Oh, this is not good.
[300:07.38]What the fuck did I just do?
[300:13.44]I saw him coming from a mile away, too.
[300:15.29]Yeah!
[300:36.89]There, boy!
[300:40.81]Get him, boy!
[301:12.64]Not this time.
[301:20.83]You know what to do, boy.
[301:55.03]Stop hurting these poor animals.
[302:03.35]They don't deserve this.
[302:15.76]Is that true?
[302:18.94]Is a minotaur an animal?
[302:21.82]What is a minotaur?
[302:22.60]Isn't a minotaur like a guy with horns that's like a bull?
[302:26.78]A minotaur is like a mythical being.
[302:38.09]Half man, half bull?
[302:40.55]Humans are animals.
[302:43.81]Yeah.
[302:47.95]Animals can be mythical too.
[302:51.24]You're an animal.
[302:52.08]I'm an animal.
[302:53.05]Stop the violence.
[302:54.23]There's no way I'm gonna let Gav die.
[303:09.18]I'll be actually upset if Gav dies.
[303:12.53]They keep killing characters.
[303:14.59]I will be upset if Gav is dead.
[303:18.45]Who goes there?
[303:22.53]This one's a deserter.
[303:24.64]Take his head.
[303:26.32]Out of my way.
[303:29.96]You made your choice.
[303:39.69]Goodbye.
[304:08.09]Your webcam is comically... Hold on.
[304:21.83]Are we doing it?
[304:28.64]Are we doing it?
[304:33.34]No, it's alright.
[304:34.48]What's his name?
[304:36.13]Uncle Fester is here to help us.
[304:38.05]What's his name?
[304:38.61]I forget his name.
[304:40.93]Sid!
[304:41.15]That's Sid.
[304:43.18]Sid.
[304:43.54]Okay, Sid.
[304:44.52]Oh, let's go.
[305:09.46]Not this time!
[305:22.17]Toast them!
[305:23.75]Die, you bastards!
[305:24.35]I think that hurt me more than it hurt him.
[305:30.73]Sorry, lad.
[305:31.17]Don't know how much help I'm gonna be here.
[305:38.28]Uh-oh!
[305:41.87]Do you have any heals, dude?
[305:42.99]Do you have any potions?
[305:48.79]Get him!
[306:04.19]A little help!
[306:09.65]I got it.
[306:27.61]That's exactly what I'm trying to do.
[306:54.50]Oh My wounds boy
[307:29.50]Jesus Christ!
[307:37.85]I had potions!
[307:39.43]I had potions and I didn't use them!
[307:44.47]Get in!
[308:09.12]That was really, really scary.
[308:10.63]We almost got the first death.
[308:22.49]Level 19.
[308:34.80]It doesn't matter.
[308:35.42]I had to sneeze and I couldn't even do the fucking funny joke.
[308:49.46]Come on.
[308:50.16]Back is itchy.
[308:53.71]Each fight in this game feels like it has a lot of weight on it.
[308:58.49]It's like everything feels like you are in this and it feels fun.
[309:03.57]Even fighting the spiders.
[309:08.68]We need to save.
[309:09.12]We got to save.
[309:09.58]Yeah, but this is too much.
[309:17.47]Shit!
[309:22.25]His eyes aren't going to turn red and he's going to turn into a big goose.
[309:27.13]Holy shit, that was cool.
[309:48.72]He's holding onto the rock, right?
[309:51.48]Yes!
[309:53.94]He's got the branch, the one branch sticking out from the rock.
[310:06.19]Do not.
[310:11.93]I've got you.
[310:12.67]Thank God.
[310:19.20]Thank God.
[310:46.05]Gav has plot armor?
[310:48.05]Well, don't speak so soon because
[310:52.16]Remember the guy that got hit in the face with the axe that we didn't even get an introduction for yet?
[310:56.21]He seemed like he was ready to get involved.
[310:57.77]Yeah, a lot of people have died.
[310:59.29]That would be deemed pretty important, I would say, yeah.
[311:21.67]Well, I found out where your friend's heading, for one thing.
[311:25.25]Gav, I... Him and his mate are on their way to your old stomping ground, Rosaria.
[311:32.76]You should have seen what they did to the Imperials who tried to stop them.
[311:38.60]There's no question about it.
[311:40.76]He's a dominant fire, alright.
[311:43.20]He can't be.
[311:44.35]Clive, I saw you turn into an icon before my very eyes.
[311:49.66]And yes, there's a good chance it was you who killed the Phoenix.
[311:56.40]But we weren't alone, were we?
[311:58.95]There was the fellow you saw enter the whirlwind.
[312:01.89]I... I saw him too.
[312:06.05]You didn't dream it, Clive.
[312:07.73]He's out there.
[312:09.07]I don't know who this guy is, but he's chuffing back at that.
[312:13.40]Don't ask me.
[312:14.08]I don't bloody know.
[312:18.59]Well, I do know one thing.
[312:20.53]You're gonna find him and find out.
[312:23.44]It's a cigarette Andy in chat right now.
[312:26.66]What?
[312:27.80]We have a few of those here.
[312:29.10]You swore you'd avenge your brother's death.
[312:31.72]That you'd never rest until you'd hunted down the man responsible.
[312:36.14]So... Find out if this man's responsible and kill yourself if he's not.
[312:44.37]Sid, I... Don't thank me.
[312:47.67]Thank Gav.
[312:55.56]Thank you, Gav.
[312:57.48]Yeah, well... A hot stew?
[313:14.74]Crusty bread?
[313:16.86]No birds returning this year.
[313:21.44]The Deadlands have swallowed their roosts, Laika's not.
[313:29.33]We're running out of time.
[313:30.45]That's definitely Joshua will be in Rosaria in a day or two Phoenix.
[313:36.02]Phoenix is don't die.
[313:42.72]It goes against all Phoenix lore ever.
[313:46.47]Back to where it all began, yeah.
[314:02.39]is that is the girl he must be stopped we don't have the reveal yet can't lawyer check the non-reveal no updated wiki no not yet
[314:33.86]Alright, cool.
[314:35.52]I think that about calls it for me.
[314:36.86]That was a good time.
[314:40.90]I will play it again.
[314:41.76]We'll stream it again.
[314:45.56]Saturday, we're going to do Steam, Next Best, and Sorcery.
[314:50.03]And then after Saturday, I'll come back to Final Fantasy XVI.
[314:53.39]What are your overall thoughts?
[315:03.66]I think it's so the boss fights are some of the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time you just feel like you're doing a good job the game does a really great job of making you think you're doing very well the dodge mechanic is really fun when the follow-up attack the music that plays in all the fights they vary it up so it's not the same thing every time which I really like
[315:30.77]I don't know how big the world is.
[315:32.37]I think that's the one kind of, I guess, outlier is.
[315:37.13]Is there an opportunity for me to go and just kind of play and go collect stuff?
[315:41.76]I'm imagining so.
[315:43.72]But as it stands so far, I think it's great.
[315:45.48]I'm going to keep playing it.
[315:57.83]It looks like there's quite a bit.
[316:04.67]How long have I played so far, including the demo?
[316:06.69]Because the demo is included in this too.
[316:07.89]So this is five hours and... Just about five hours and some change.
[316:12.58]Eight.
[316:13.78]Eight hours total so far.
[316:14.84]Probably another island.
[316:18.00]Yeah, we'll see.
[316:20.16]I like it.
[316:20.52]I'm having a good time playing it, so I'm going to keep playing it.
[316:25.81]And yes, the stream was sponsored, but I mean, I think you all know.
[316:30.43]I don't think I would come back to the game and play it again if I wasn't into it, so.
[316:35.17]We'll play it again.
[316:35.91]You'll see it on this channel at some point early next week, mid next week.
[316:45.50]It's a good game, yeah.
[316:50.27]And I'll see you Saturday.
[316:52.39]Thank you again Square Enix for sponsoring the stream.
[316:55.65]Again, it's on PS5 right now.
[316:59.49]If you have a PS5, I highly recommend you at least check out the demo.
[317:03.51]Because that is free and you can just play a little bit of the first few hours of the game.
[317:07.33]First like hour or two.
[317:08.83]Just about.
[317:09.19]I want to make sure I save it though.
[317:15.47]I think it's auto saves.
[317:18.61]Yeah, I think it's auto saves will be fine.
[317:33.32]Is this coming through my... That's weird.
[317:34.96]It's coming through my speakers.
[317:35.88]There's supposed to be music playing, but it's just coming through my actual speakers.
[317:44.32]Can you hear it?
[317:51.28]Very, very faintly.
[317:57.61]Well, it's playing to my right somehow.
[318:06.16]It's only when you talk.
[318:10.00]Well, thanks for sticking around.
[318:11.20]Have a great night.
[318:12.96]Call your mother.
[318:14.60]Final Fantasy 16.
[318:15.76]Go check it out.
[318:24.77]Thank you for resuming sorcery.
[318:26.07]My mother is back from her trip just in time.
[318:30.85]Well, there you go.
[318:34.35]Put it close to the mic.
[318:35.17]I kind of can't.
[318:36.47]My mic is connected to my desk.
[318:39.01]Kind of bolt it on.
[318:50.18]Yeah, it's not going anywhere.
[318:54.24]When's the next no-cam chill stream?
[318:57.06]I've been doing a lot of those.
[318:57.89]I mean, just kind of face cam and high energy to sort of whenever I have the energy, I'll do it.
[319:07.30]But, yeah, I mean, maybe next stream?
[319:09.86]The next Final Fantasy stream, absolutely.
[319:11.34]We'll just kind of hang out.
[319:13.47]And just have my mouth open.
[319:15.57]Just playing it.
[319:24.22]What demos do you plan on checking out for Next Fest?
[319:26.84]Um, I plan on just going to the popular tab.
[319:29.24]Obviously, also, if you have a recommendation, put it in the Discord.
[319:32.74]The Discord recommendation channel.
[319:37.34]Give it a... Give it a look.
[319:41.50]If you have one that you think, well, yeah, you really should play that, then throw it in the recommended.
[319:47.16]I'll take a look.
[319:48.06]Add it on the list.
[319:48.52]I plan on just kind of blowing through a dozen of them or so over a few hours.
[319:58.59]But, see you later.
[320:00.63]Don't forget the BLT.
[320:01.69]No, I won't.
[320:02.53]I'll take at least one bite of a BLT on Saturday.
[320:08.58]Probably starting around 4 Pacific on Saturday.
[320:11.14]4 p.m.
[320:17.86]Alright, I'll see you later.
[320:18.64]Have a good night.
[320:20.48]Take care of yourselves.
[320:23.82]And goodbye.
[321:03.04]Thank you.
