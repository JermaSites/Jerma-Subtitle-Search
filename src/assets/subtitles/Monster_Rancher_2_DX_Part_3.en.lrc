[ve:60.16.100]

[00:17.16]I'm just hanging out.
[00:19.66]What are you up to?
[00:23.78]How are you?
[00:25.06]How are you?
[00:25.80]Good to see you.
[00:30.14]I'm dry.
[00:30.72]My hair's a little wet.
[00:34.91]I'm in the shower.
[00:35.69]I had to take a shower, and I just didn't.
[00:44.50]Oh, I'm clean now.
[00:47.72]Clean Andy.
[00:48.24]Prove it.
[00:48.54]You gotta prove it?
[00:49.84]Okay.
[00:50.94]I'll prove it.
[00:52.40]In a minute.
[00:56.69]Did you get stuck in the drain?
[00:59.91]Obviously not, because I'm here!
[01:04.03]I did, actually.
[01:04.61]My toe got stuck.
[01:09.85]He's lying.
[01:10.59]I'm not lying.
[01:12.15]You'll see my wet hair in a second.
[01:13.58]I'm not doing facecam today.
[01:14.78]Maybe I will.
[01:15.26]I got a coffee, too.
[01:23.56]We can go over a few things today.
[01:24.90]Let me tweet this.
[01:27.08]I'll be right back.
[03:13.09]Alright.
[03:13.75]I didn't tweet yet.
[03:14.35]I have to send a message.
[03:18.81]Let me send a message.
[03:21.81]Okay.
[03:24.37]A rank today.
[03:29.11]That's exactly what we're doing.
[03:30.23]We're going to try to get to A rank with Cosmic Calamity.
[03:33.93]If you don't know who Cosmic Calamity is.
[03:36.86]Been living under a rock.
[03:39.11]Biggest superstar in the monster...fighting...uh...leagues?
[03:46.67]Okay, let me just put my Twitch here.
[03:47.87]Yeah, I had to take a shower.
[03:59.80]I was feeling very icky.
[04:05.36]Okay.
[04:06.42]Alright, I'm ready.
[04:06.92]No more stalling.
[04:08.80]How are you?
[04:09.98]Let's move over here.
[04:13.70]Actually, maybe I'll stall for just a minute here, because I have to explain a few things.
[04:18.41]So, this week, we got some interesting things to do.
[04:22.65]If you missed the stream from a couple days ago, I would suggest you go watch it.
[04:27.23]It was a fun time.
[04:27.93]I was on Mizkif's stream doing parasocial.
[04:32.23]It was a good time.
[04:33.51]That was Monday.
[04:34.19]Today we're going to do Monster Rancher 2.
[04:36.37]And then from Monster Rancher 2, we're going to go to Monster Rancher 2 and hopefully beat this game real soon.
[04:46.26]Hoping to.
[04:48.85]Like I told you, I'm not going to stop streaming this game until we at least get to S rank with somebody.
[04:59.58]After this stream, we're going to get the You Laugh, You Lose stuff ready.
[05:06.52]And the Baby Sensory stuff.
[05:08.76]Because that's where we're going to take an entire stream.
[05:12.48]So that will be Tuesday the 21st.
[05:16.76]I have to come up with some incentives.
[05:20.16]I don't want it to just be like, oh, if I laugh... I lost!
[05:24.10]I think this should be some interesting incentive.
[05:28.16]Yeah, what do we get if you laugh?
[05:29.02]Exactly what I'm saying.
[05:31.25]Well, you just lose.
[05:32.29]Well, yeah, you just lose, but I want there to be something to do.
[05:40.87]You give subs.
[05:41.45]Yeah, that's... I could do that.
[05:44.33]I think there's other ones, too, that could be fun.
[05:49.09]Okay, you said ice that motherfucker.
[05:50.83]You're talking about this, um... You're talking about this character.
[05:55.64]What I thought you were saying is pour ice down your pants.
[05:59.60]If I laugh.
[06:02.58]That's a... I could do that?
[06:04.14]Possible?
[06:12.67]You laugh?
[06:13.75]You pour ice down your pants.
[06:18.73]I fucking spilled already and it even 10 minutes.
[06:22.43]God damn it.
[06:26.58]This is why I have an AI.
[06:27.72]This is why I just have to only use Amazon basics keyboards only there.
[06:32.44]Never.
[06:33.06]I can never have anything remotely valuable underneath me in this room ever.
[06:41.38]You know you see those streamer setups that they look amazing?
[06:44.36]There's all those cool like swirling lights and there's awesome pristine keyboards and they've got so much cool shit.
[06:50.79]They have so much wire control.
[06:52.75]No, I will break that stuff.
[06:54.73]I will ruin it.
[06:57.75]Coffee is underneath the space bar now and I can't get it.
[07:01.63]I need a paper towel.
[07:02.31]Hold on.
[07:02.55]Give me one second.
[07:32.03]Alright, hello.
[07:32.59]You gotta do that thing where you bunch up a piece of toilet paper or paper towel and you slide it under.
[07:38.90]I'm picking a lock.
[07:42.04]You have to slide it long ways underneath the keys and like tilt it around.
[07:49.48]I'll break it if I pop it off.
[07:53.23]Will I break it?
[07:53.79]Let me see.
[08:00.03]Have you voted in the awards?
[08:02.19]I mean, the voting's not open yet.
[08:04.17]Hopefully that's not a problem.
[08:05.51]I just pulled the space bar off.
[08:06.53]Is that a problem?
[08:09.15]Oh, no.
[08:11.25]Alright, I can get under here, though.
[08:12.99]Oh, what else is under here?
[08:14.17]I feel like I just lifted up the couch.
[08:20.11]Ugh!
[08:22.33]Ugh!
[08:22.43]Is that what it looks like under there?
[08:24.85]Cover it back up.
[08:30.42]Alright, let's go.
[08:35.07]Shit, I didn't put it on right.
[08:36.17]I put it on upside down.
[08:38.55]I don't care.
[08:39.27]I don't care.
[08:39.61]I'll fix it later.
[08:40.17]Alright, let's do it.
[08:42.27]Welcome back, everybody.
[08:44.41]We're doing vigorous training.
[08:46.02]You want to just prove that I... Okay, I'll prove it.
[08:49.98]Okay, here you go.
[08:53.54]See?
[08:56.74]Prove that I was just in the shower.
[08:57.98]There it is.
[08:59.66]No more facecam.
[09:00.68]Not today.
[09:01.08]You're looking nice and slick.
[09:08.04]Hey, thanks.
[09:13.98]Oh, yeah.
[09:14.20]The You Laugh, You Lose stuff, I've never done it before.
[09:16.56]I can't believe I've gone 10 plus years across YouTube and Twitch, and I've never done it.
[09:28.58]I have no idea what's going to happen.
[09:30.22]Why have I not?
[09:30.82]I don't know.
[09:31.32]I just haven't.
[09:31.70]There's never was a reason for me to do it.
[09:37.22]It's because it's lazy content.
[09:38.72]I think it's fun.
[09:39.30]Look, something can be lazy content and be really fun to do.
[09:46.06]It's alright.
[09:46.46]Alright, so what does the schedule look like?
[09:52.27]First of all, hey, welcome again.
[09:53.39]Thanks for coming by the stream.
[09:56.99]Let's go.
[09:59.75]Put the cam back on.
[10:00.73]Alright, I'll put the cam back on for... There is something else I want to address that I thought was hilarious, but I want to wait until a lot of people are here because it's one of the funniest fucking things I've seen in like at least a month.
[10:11.48]So we need to wait.
[10:13.52]I want to wait until everyone gets here.
[10:14.68]Alright, last thing I did is I beat C rank.
[10:20.98]So we're going to take this guy.
[10:23.07]Do some training.
[10:26.05]Wait, what is the actual... Let me see the data.
[10:30.90]Okay.
[10:31.74]621 intelligence.
[10:34.48]8k is not enough.
[10:37.73]8k isn't enough.
[10:39.79]Well... I'm not saying it's not enough.
[10:43.33]I'm just saying it has to... Give me like 30 or 40 minutes so everyone that wants to be here is here.
[10:51.63]So I want to get to like probably 700 intelligence.
[10:54.45]And like 300 or 400 skill.
[10:58.77]The only way this thing is ever going to be worth using is just by being a glass cannon.
[11:03.48]That's it.
[11:05.22]So we're doing the same thing we did before.
[11:06.74]Get him in there.
[11:09.76]Start with the... Not power.
[11:13.40]Intelligence and skill.
[11:14.52]Meditate.
[11:14.98]Go for it.
[11:15.40]This is the worst monster in the game, Jeremy.
[11:19.94]You need to let it go.
[11:22.35]I think I can get this guy to A rank.
[11:24.21]I really do.
[11:30.84]Damn it.
[11:33.86]Needs more life.
[11:38.58]Alright, you see him well.
[11:40.24]How am I still soft?
[11:45.66]B. Alright, when's the actual official B tournament?
[11:50.24]Right here.
[11:50.56]Alright, I got a little while.
[11:52.88]I got some time.
[11:56.50]Okay, you guys ready?
[11:58.78]Are you guys ready to hear one of the funniest things I've fucking seen all week?
[12:03.45]So somebody in the Discord had a little bit of a problem.
[12:07.99]Just a small problem.
[12:09.71]And they brought it to the Discord's attention.
[12:12.99]And my stomach hurt from laughing at this picture.
[12:19.21]So, why don't we take a look and see what happened?
[12:24.74]So this is what they posted.
[12:28.10]I'm actually going to turn the game capture off for a second.
[12:33.38]So, uh, Jazzyball has a little story for us.
[12:38.69]And it goes something like this.
[12:41.03]So I'm home for the holidays from college, and I decide to watch some Jerma vids on my parents' big TV.
[12:47.79]Because I was bored.
[12:49.13]Okay, we've established what's going on.
[12:51.53]So I microwave some pizza, and turn it on to this compilation of edits of Jerma's faces.
[12:57.49]When it gets to this face, however, the TV froze.
[13:01.83]So I tried turning it on and off to restart it, but the TV just won't turn off, and it's stuck on this fucked up image of Jerma's face.
[13:11.52]Okay, I don't know how that happened.
[13:13.76]A couple hours pass, and I don't know why it took me a while, but I finally decide to unplug the TV.
[13:20.29]And then I realize that the face is permanently burned onto the screen.
[13:24.83]Like it's just stuck there.
[13:26.85]My parents aren't back until later in the night.
[13:29.33]So now I'm freaking out trying to cover the screen.
[13:33.07]So that they don't see the stupid face burned onto their thousand dollar TV.
[13:37.56]What do I do?
[13:44.80]I don't even understand.
[13:48.72]Screen burn-in?
[13:51.57]How long does screen burn-in last?
[13:58.01]People are saying fake, but I mean, it looks kind of real.
[14:02.92]Screen burn- Screen burn- Screen burn- Oh, LEDs can be permanent.
[14:07.94]No, it's not.
[14:12.40]Okay.
[14:13.42]That's insane if it is.
[14:19.23]It's fucked up forever.
[14:20.69]So what do you do?
[14:25.60]OLED, it can be permanent.
[14:28.19]Okay, well, here's what we need.
[14:29.21]This is very important.
[14:33.71]24 hours from now, I need an update.
[14:35.97]Or even now.
[14:36.69]Like, even like 6 to 12 hours from now.
[14:40.93]I want to see the improvement.
[14:45.07]Imagine coming home.
[14:47.42]And this is what you see on the TV.
[14:51.20]You were asking, what do you do about this?
[14:54.14]You can't just throw a blanket on this.
[14:56.96]Why is there a blanket on the TV?
[15:00.60]You're going to have to just come clean and say, I don't know what happened.
[15:03.00]I left this face on here.
[15:10.14]Pay them back.
[15:10.96]Replace the TV.
[15:14.98]It's your fault.
[15:15.92]You need to replace the TV.
[15:17.90]I didn't do anything.
[15:20.65]It's my fault?
[15:24.09]You have to replace it.
[15:25.51]I didn't sell the TV to this person.
[15:32.66]You psycho.
[15:33.28]You destroyed somebody's TV.
[15:36.68]So that's what... Okay.
[15:39.04]According to what they said, this is what it looks like when the TV is unplugged.
[15:47.69]Buy the TV from them.
[15:50.34]Alright, I'll tell you.
[15:51.64]If it's permanent... Thanks a lot, dude.
[15:58.64]Now this is burned into my monitor.
[16:00.52]Just have a screensaver.
[16:04.31]How is it emitting blue light if it's unplugged?
[16:08.83]Oh, it's not unplugged.
[16:10.29]Okay, I see, I see.
[16:12.63]But that's just what it looks like when it's turned on.
[16:17.79]Okay.
[16:19.04]We need an update.
[16:19.56]Okay.
[16:23.95]Replace it, replace the TV.
[16:28.65]Can you imagine?
[16:31.43]Like just, I get him in touch with community Jake.
[16:33.97]It's just like, let's get, let's get, let's get this person a new TV.
[16:44.16]It's your fault.
[16:48.72]I love that though.
[16:49.42]That's so funny.
[16:50.08]We need an update.
[16:52.66]Buy this TV and put it in your house.
[16:54.38]They're very active on Discord right now.
[17:01.95]Okay.
[17:11.03]It's too funny.
[17:13.24]Put it up on the Reddit shelf?
[17:18.56]Yeah, maybe... If that's actually real, that's too funny.
[17:23.99]Maybe we'll have to get you in touch with the community, Jake.
[17:26.69]Let's see what we can do for you.
[17:28.17]Because that's absolutely hysterical that you are going to get in trouble for that.
[17:37.94]Put it up as a third monitor.
[17:38.98]There's no way the burn-in happens like that permanently.
[17:43.74]I don't know.
[17:44.06]It's really funny regardless.
[17:45.40]It looks real to me.
[17:48.14]Use your head, Jerma.
[17:49.02]It's not real.
[17:50.06]It's funny, though.
[17:57.25]You're gonna get scammed.
[17:59.27]I didn't say this was gonna happen.
[18:00.61]I just said we need some extra evidence and some extra proof that it was real.
[18:03.84]I need to write this down.
[18:13.06]Note, funny equals real.
[18:15.34]I didn't say funny.
[18:16.18]I said we need a little bit more evidence.
[18:22.24]Okay, we need to do some more training.
[18:23.42]Because he didn't do it last time.
[18:29.96]Come on.
[18:36.03]Don't fail it again, please.
[18:36.99]Alright, good.
[18:43.07]Even if it's fake, the idea is really funny.
[18:45.59]Yeah, alright.
[18:52.74]The image view naked on stream is burned into my monitor.
[18:55.52]What should I do?
[19:01.59]Now let me be very clear about this.
[19:04.51]Very clear.
[19:06.31]This is a, this is a funny, this is a funny little thing that happened.
[19:11.71]I, I ain't replacing all your TVs, okay?
[19:14.32]If you go buy an OLED TV today, and deliberately burn an image of my face on it, I ain't fucking replacing it.
[19:21.22]I just, let's be very clear about this.
[19:25.84]You're doing that on your own free will, I have nothing to do with that.
[19:28.10]I'm gonna make that very clear.
[19:32.92]in before the wave of OLED TV burn-in images that like, dude, I fucking left the TV on and it burned an image of you and oh my God, what do I do about it?
[19:43.03]Help me.
[19:44.53]I'm sorry.
[19:54.53]Not happening.
[19:55.83]Oh, it's Calamity's birthday.
[20:05.57]Yeah, so if you want to do that, that's up to you.
[20:08.38]I got nothing to do with it.
[20:09.22]Okay.
[20:19.55]I got a lot of money.
[20:30.08]How old is Cosmic Andy?
[20:32.65]Cosmic Andy is two years old at this point now.
[20:36.39]My dad saw a video of yours.
[20:39.99]He had a heart attack.
[20:43.23]No, no, we're not going down this road.
[20:45.21]Not going down this road today.
[20:49.90]Let's get three mint leaves.
[20:52.72]And let's get three nuts oil.
[20:54.60]Oh, I can only hold two.
[20:55.50]Okay, fine.
[21:14.84]I actually am going to... No, I won't.
[21:17.42]Let's do nuts oil.
[21:21.60]And we're going to do normal skill training.
[21:34.45]How does it feel to be a permanent screensaver?
[21:40.69]Skill, let's go.
[21:43.09]I'm doing this in the wrong order.
[21:45.15]Okay, I'll fix it next week.
[21:54.13]Remember, there's a lack of worst hair nominees.
[21:57.19]I don't think that just means my hair looked better this year.
[22:07.93]I need to do 50 beam usages?
[22:09.69]Alright, keep counting.
[22:16.96]And we have to do the mint leaf.
[22:23.50]I wonder when we're gonna get... When is he gonna get too old?
[22:38.28]He's on death's door now.
[22:43.08]No, he's not.
[22:44.46]He's got, like, at least another year or two.
[22:46.88]This monster has one of the longest lifespans.
[22:48.80]Exactly.
[22:51.06]Don't tell me that he's gonna die.
[22:54.83]Won't be able to handle it.
[22:59.55]It's literally just a wall, dude.
[23:00.75]It's gonna live a long time.
[23:01.85]It might.
[23:02.11]Tablets.
[23:05.93]Training.
[23:06.35]Training.
[23:09.69]It's got a normal lifespan of 410 game weeks.
[23:12.05]Oh, nice.
[23:13.97]Errantry?
[23:17.93]Okay, so if this is Errantry... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:20.49]Good, good, good.
[23:20.93]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[23:23.69]Stressed out.
[23:24.18]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[23:24.92]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[23:29.92]I got a bunch of dumb items.
[23:32.58]What is all this shit?
[23:35.38]Ooh.
[23:37.14]Just eat this.
[23:47.44]Is this the new release?
[23:48.34]It is.
[23:48.72]This game is currently on Steam right now.
[23:53.92]It's a bundle of the first and second game.
[23:55.90]You get them both.
[23:59.06]They are, and it's also on iOS too right now, I think, which is amazing.
[24:02.94]And it's on Switch.
[24:06.23]God, I hope they make another one.
[24:07.67]Like, just make another Monster Rancher.
[24:11.09]I know it sucks because they need, like, they need, like, 10 million people to buy this game to make it worth doing another one.
[24:16.92]I don't know if it's gonna happen.
[24:20.00]Whatever number they need to hit, I hope they hit because I would really love a new generation Monster Rancher video game.
[24:34.37]Alright, I need to buy much more of this stuff.
[24:39.24]Actually, hold on.
[24:40.52]I can sell this crap too, can't I?
[24:44.46]What?
[24:45.08]Stimulate a monster's abilities?
[24:49.75]Can you get banned for doing these drugs?
[24:56.31]This will temporarily stimulate a monster's abilities.
[25:00.35]What does it do?
[25:04.84]Alright, I'm going to sell some of this stuff.
[25:07.06]The magic banana.
[25:09.28]I'm just going to sell it.
[25:10.20]I don't want to use it.
[25:17.04]Unless maybe I should just use it.
[25:18.74]We have at least two or three Monster Rancher lore masters.
[25:23.68]It's going to reduce your lifespan.
[25:24.76]Don't use it.
[25:25.32]Okay.
[25:26.92]Alright, alright.
[25:30.07]Okay, alright.
[25:30.81]I'll just sell it.
[25:35.69]I need to make room for leaves and... you know.
[25:40.92]Sell the mango, I don't want it.
[25:43.16]Sell the banana, I don't want it.
[25:44.36]I don't even know what it does.
[25:45.50]I think it reduces lifespan.
[25:46.62]500 for this, holy shit.
[25:50.74]Alright, that's pretty good.
[25:54.15]I'm gonna keep the disk chips because you can combine them, right?
[25:58.69]When you actually combine monsters.
[26:01.80]Alright, now we need at least two more mint leaves and four more nuts oils.
[26:06.97]While the sale is here.
[26:08.13]Okay.
[26:21.08]Five, four.
[26:22.02]I'm about to use one of these anyways, so.
[26:24.40]Alright.
[26:26.57]Okay.
[26:30.38]I had a dream that you were streaming yourself cutting Ster's brakes.
[26:36.22]Why?
[26:41.25]Okay.
[26:43.61]I'm gonna rest because I need to kind of reset this.
[26:49.98]What kind of dream is that?
[26:53.78]Cutting his brakes?
[27:01.38]Alright, let's do nuts oil.
[27:04.77]Let's do this right.
[27:05.93]Mint leaf.
[27:12.87]Regular training.
[27:14.39]Nuts oil.
[27:20.93]Heavy training.
[27:31.76]I'm going to go take a nap.
[27:32.52]Dermot, can you wake me up in a couple hours?
[27:35.78]In two hours, I'll make sure to scream really, really loud.
[27:38.10]Just make sure you have your headphones on.
[27:47.47]Wait.
[27:48.71]Yes, right?
[27:55.55]Yes.
[28:01.17]Put a scream timer on.
[28:06.85]That doesn't mean a scream timer.
[28:08.05]Alright.
[28:14.60]Give us a big value here.
[28:16.40]Is it cheating?
[28:22.80]That's cheating.
[28:23.36]Whatever.
[28:28.04]700 intelligence should be enough.
[28:31.38]to be able to at least beat A rank.
[28:37.37]How long is the stream gonna be?
[28:39.77]I don't know.
[28:40.23]Still done having fun.
[28:43.33]Do defense?
[28:56.40]I think it's too late to do defense.
[29:01.87]It's too late, I think.
[29:03.17]We need to be able to one-hit anti people.
[29:04.87]Defense is worthless.
[29:14.08]I think they've changed a bunch of stuff in the game.
[29:18.06]Or not changed, but patched old broken shit that doesn't work anymore.
[29:22.16]Right?
[29:23.88]There was a bunch of bugs in the original game that they just fixed.
[29:26.98]And I think it made some of the things more valuable.
[29:38.91]At what point is the magic slab smarter than you?
[29:44.57]Probably now.
[29:45.53]I don't... It's out of a thousand.
[29:49.40]So... I wonder what my monster sheet would look like.
[29:52.70]Okay, so if it's out of a thousand... My monster sheet definitely looks like this.
[30:03.32]Life is probably 120.
[30:08.41]Power, like 140.
[30:10.33]150.
[30:10.96]Like here.
[30:14.86]Intelligence, probably like 240.
[30:15.66]So like down here.
[30:19.04]Skill, I'm putting up to like 700 or 800.
[30:22.02]Like here.
[30:24.76]Speed is probably like 140.
[30:27.41]And defense is 0.
[30:27.97]What do you mean, what?
[30:40.23]Fame, zero.
[30:44.03]That's not accurate.
[30:46.95]Fame would be 30.
[30:50.46]Alright.
[30:51.42]Who would... Okay, at our peaks right now.
[30:55.14]Jerma985 or this slab in this game's universe.
[30:58.70]Who is more popular?
[31:01.08]With the 18 to 35 demographic.
[31:02.76]I gotta make that very, very, very clear.
[31:08.93]No, I don't think so.
[31:14.88]I think it's me.
[31:18.74]I think I would be more popular.
[31:26.70]Alright.
[31:27.05]Well, all those would be pretty bad.
[31:32.31]The last thing we did was... What did I eat?
[31:36.07]I have such a stupid attention span.
[31:38.65]It was... What was the last thing that I just did?
[31:43.06]The last thing I clicked on?
[31:46.16]Because I need to give a... You didn't do anything yet.
[31:52.24]But what was the last thing I did?
[31:53.88]I gave tablets.
[31:54.44]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[31:55.46]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[31:56.26]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[31:57.66]Alright.
[32:05.83]Big success.
[32:12.41]Big success.
[32:17.81]Do it.
[32:19.61]Good.
[32:26.33]656 intelligence.
[32:30.12]Getting there.
[32:38.70]When is the tournament?
[32:41.06]I think it's coming up soon.
[32:42.00]In like a week or two.
[32:45.00]I wonder if I can handle it.
[32:51.28]So I can do skill, rest, and then we're going for B cup.
[33:00.55]I can get skill over 300, which would be big.
[33:12.03]Good.
[33:12.71]Excellent.
[33:15.20]Keep the horror.
[33:15.84]I don't have that image anymore.
[33:20.34]There we go.
[33:21.70]You want to peep the horror?
[33:22.72]Here.
[33:28.40]It's an old-ass clock, too.
[33:29.96]I like that clock.
[33:32.26]I didn't even see that clock.
[33:33.27]That clock's awesome.
[33:33.97]Alright, rest up before the battle.
[33:41.49]See if I can handle B rank.
[33:43.63]This is A rank.
[33:44.57]If I beat this, I'll get to A rank.
[33:49.15]What time is it on that clock?
[33:52.23]It is... 6.
[33:52.63]6.
[33:59.16]Like... 6, like, 17?
[34:03.26]6, 18?
[34:06.44]I win.
[34:11.37]You're in pretty good shape.
[34:12.15]It's very well... Alright.
[34:13.77]Let's do it.
[34:14.23]I hope I can handle this.
[34:17.03]Be rank.
[34:18.45]This is the big one.
[34:19.05]This is a huge deal.
[34:26.63]Official B rank cup.
[34:29.07]Let's go.
[34:33.36]I'm actually kind of scared.
[34:34.26]Because we have not seen any of these people.
[34:44.82]Pirate?
[34:45.58]Piratio?
[34:47.50]Pirato.
[34:50.13]Alright.
[34:51.31]Let's go.
[34:56.47]What is with this?
[34:56.99]What's this defense?
[34:58.03]Oh, you're dead though because that doesn't matter for intelligence.
[35:03.68]Yo, it's over.
[35:07.96]Let's go.
[35:09.12]You know what to do.
[35:10.64]Stay back.
[35:13.74]Bye.
[35:15.80]Let's get this B rank.
[35:20.22]A rank today.
[35:24.09]Got all the defense in the wrong places.
[35:31.51]People were not feeling this strategy before.
[35:37.16]Here's where this all falls apart.
[35:38.64]If there's another really high intelligence, high speed monster, that's the hard, complete hard opposite.
[35:49.07]That's like paper versus rock.
[35:51.07]I would absolutely lose that.
[35:52.83]So we just hope it's not anybody here.
[35:57.25]Whoa, look at that thing.
[35:58.03]I think it was like a weird dinosaur.
[36:04.69]Wall versus wall.
[36:05.47]That wall does... Maybe that wall is power.
[36:11.46]Alright.
[36:11.96]I was actually really scared before.
[36:13.14]Now I think I'm alright.
[36:16.70]Like... Likele?
[36:18.38]Like... Like... Like... Likele.
[36:24.28]The bunny?
[36:25.22]Probably high speed.
[36:25.86]This is still fine.
[36:30.22]I just have to hit you once.
[36:31.72]I don't have to care about anything else.
[36:33.35]We can throw coins in the air.
[36:37.56]Alright.
[36:38.20]I do have to worry about that power, though.
[36:39.58]That's a lot.
[36:40.00]I have no defense.
[36:41.90]We gotta stay back.
[36:47.31]That's it.
[36:47.71]Goodbye.
[36:47.97]46% throw the coin in the air.
[36:48.63]We win.
[36:55.69]If I miss, it's over.
[36:58.53]Because I can't take more than one hit, I don't think, or two hits total.
[37:15.60]I don't like Cosmic Andy.
[37:17.04]Well, Cosmic Andy is probably going to be dead.
[37:18.54]Probably within the next one stream hour.
[37:25.33]The whole point is to get Cosmic Andy.
[37:29.13]I just keep forgetting their name.
[37:31.13]Up to A rank so we unlock the other monster types that we can unlock from the CD stuff.
[37:38.03]Looks like they're going to do what they're supposed to do.
[37:44.28]As long as we beat B rank, we get access to like, I think, five or six more breeds.
[37:48.72]That's good.
[37:49.14]Alright, wall versus wall.
[37:50.28]What do you got?
[37:57.42]Alright.
[37:57.70]That speed.
[38:01.59]How do you even have speed that low?
[38:05.51]You built your character like a moron.
[38:10.73]Too spread out.
[38:11.49]It's over.
[38:11.81]I win.
[38:12.43]Way too spread out.
[38:18.73]See you later.
[38:27.02]It's worked every time so far.
[38:28.74]People, I don't know if I would vote against this right now.
[38:32.26]That's a bad idea.
[38:32.98]Remember, there are some unlockable monsters that you can get by beating a D-rank battle at a specific time.
[38:45.09]Really.
[38:46.21]Really.
[38:49.49]I actually might be able to beat A rank with this monster and that just opens up the floodgates.
[39:01.68]What if you miss?
[39:04.18]Then I lose.
[39:06.16]But looks like statistics are on our side today.
[39:12.51]The official A rank matches way harder.
[39:15.93]I'm going to assume that this is not going to be the character that I beat A rank with.
[39:19.69]I just wanted to get to A rank with this character.
[39:22.82]Because then we can unlock some more stuff, do some combinations.
[39:26.70]Have maybe some higher base stat monsters and go from there.
[39:29.49]Alright, Epsilon.
[39:38.89]It's like a robot.
[39:40.81]This looks like a rare monster.
[39:43.04]Very spread out.
[39:43.92]I think I still... I just have to... I don't know if I want to hit kill.
[39:47.72]That's a lot of speed.
[39:49.18]Alright, I'm kind of scared.
[39:49.88]A lot of speed.
[39:59.98]Uh-oh, it's over.
[40:04.09]It's actually over.
[40:05.67]If you miss the first shot, it's over.
[40:07.83]Oh, no, it's not.
[40:08.47]No, it's not.
[40:08.87]No, it's not.
[40:09.25]No, it's not.
[40:09.65]I can do it again.
[40:12.43]Hold on.
[40:12.91]Hold on.
[40:15.69]Yes!
[40:17.63]Different move.
[40:28.78]Okay, it's almost mathematically impossible for me to lose.
[40:34.90]The Pirateu needs to lose one more time.
[40:39.04]And I actually know I have to win my next two.
[40:40.72]Okay.
[40:53.95]I destroyed Pirateu though.
[40:55.45]That's the competition right now.
[41:04.43]That wall has 25 speed.
[41:06.59]It means you're going to get hit by every single attack.
[41:10.75]Nothing will miss you.
[41:11.45]Alright, Sanjuras.
[41:16.74]This is the weird, like, sun one, right?
[41:18.66]I kind of want one of these.
[41:19.48]That's so cool.
[41:24.80]Uh-oh.
[41:29.08]Oh, shit.
[41:29.56]Okay, hold on.
[41:34.35]I still think I'm okay.
[41:39.86]The speed and the life I'm concerned about, but all we have to do is flip a coin.
[41:46.90]And... this percentage is here.
[41:48.94]Bye.
[41:56.03]I knew it.
[41:56.69]I knew that just dumping every training regimen into intelligence was the right call.
[42:10.19]I'm getting great coin flips though.
[42:12.07]I've only lost one coin flip.
[42:16.21]Out of probably seven or eight times.
[42:18.01]Somebody said I'm missing a doctor's appointment for this.
[42:34.31]No, go to your doctor's appointment.
[42:36.53]Trust me.
[42:37.94]You'll be pissed in a few days.
[42:41.22]Because whatever's wrong, you're gonna look back and be like, I fucking had an opportunity to go.
[42:45.44]Trust me.
[42:51.07]Too late.
[42:51.47]I already missed it.
[42:52.95]Oh.
[43:00.35]I'll watch the stream in the waiting room.
[43:06.54]Alright.
[43:08.00]Robe kneel.
[43:11.47]Robenil has not been doing very well.
[43:16.65]I don't know why.
[43:17.17]Stats are pretty good.
[43:21.31]Really high health.
[43:25.14]What's the problem here?
[43:26.62]Just too spread out?
[43:29.14]No, that ain't my fucking problem.
[43:30.70]He's eating fucking cemetery.
[43:32.78]Oh.
[43:33.88]Oh.
[43:38.70]Oh.
[43:43.41]I can't go backwards.
[43:44.31]I just have to hit you once.
[43:48.38]Come here.
[43:48.82]Back it up.
[43:49.32]Come on.
[43:49.60]Come on.
[43:49.92]Come on.
[43:51.38]What?
[43:52.46]Shit.
[43:52.72]It's okay.
[43:56.08]Holy shit.
[43:56.86]That's the four in a row that I've missed.
[43:58.70]Alright.
[43:59.00]It doesn't matter.
[44:00.82]I just hit one.
[44:06.91]Back it up.
[44:08.91]Back it up.
[44:11.13]Oh, you piece of shit.
[44:16.43]I'll be able to do one more.
[44:17.19]I need 24 guts.
[44:19.37]Come on.
[44:21.29]22, 23, 24.
[44:21.41]I lost.
[44:26.73]I lost.
[44:26.99]I actually lost.
[44:37.55]Well, here comes all the coin flips I'm going to lose in a row.
[44:42.10]60% lost it six or seven times in a row.
[44:53.85]I still win.
[44:56.09]Who has one loss?
[44:59.67]Okay.
[45:00.83]Hirateyu is the only one that has two losses.
[45:05.44]If they lose the next match, I clinched it.
[45:07.04]Yeah.
[45:10.40]Pirateo just has to lose.
[45:19.17]Alright.
[45:20.03]Who's Pirateo going against?
[45:21.05]Alright.
[45:30.97]I just can't lose this.
[45:33.42]I either can't lose this or Pirateo has to lose the next match.
[45:36.04]Alright, Aspen, let's go.
[45:39.89]Let's go, let's go!
[45:43.20]Yikes.
[45:48.76]Okay.
[45:49.66]I just have to get a hit off first.
[45:53.19]Oh shit, it's Jerma.
[45:54.83]Right?
[45:55.21]Because that's exactly what I said my stats would look like.
[45:57.05]I don't have wings.
[46:05.80]coin flip not yet though just pissed him off clinched it alright we got it I just unlocked like a bunch of breeds I love this game this game is so much fun it really is
[46:45.82]Rank alone doesn't unlock breeds.
[46:47.04]They have very cryptic unlocks.
[46:49.57]Yeah, I know that there's probably like more than a dozen breeds that you have to do specific things for.
[46:55.63]But once you get to rank four, doesn't that unlock like four or five different breeds?
[47:02.62]Getting to that trainer rank four?
[47:04.14]No?
[47:07.54]Are you sure?
[47:08.28]I thought it did.
[47:09.74]It doesn't unlock shit.
[47:10.85]It doesn't?
[47:11.19]I thought it did.
[47:21.75]It unlocks a tournament that you have to attend.
[47:24.15]Oh.
[47:30.33]It's something very specific for everyone.
[47:31.63]Alright, let's... Is there a good unlock guide?
[47:38.43]I know there's a good website.
[47:41.19]What's it called?
[47:41.65]The Legend Cup, right?
[47:49.06]Isn't that a good place to do it?
[47:53.80]Monster Ranch 2 unlocking guide for all 38 breeds.
[47:56.66]Holy shit, there are 38 other breeds to unlock?
[48:02.24]Wow.
[48:02.52]Alright.
[48:06.46]Let's go through this.
[48:08.81]I'm at 100 fame.
[48:13.11]Okay, some of them are locked behind errantries.
[48:14.81]Some are cryptic as hell.
[48:20.99]Ooh, look at that increase.
[48:21.97]That's good.
[48:24.65]Okay, achieve breeder rank of 4, beat B rank.
[48:29.68]And you need to purchase the first house upgrade.
[48:35.30]What the fuck?
[48:36.34]Okay, hold on a minute.
[48:37.44]This is ridiculous.
[48:40.61]If you have 17,000 gold or more on May 4th, Vinto will arrive and upgrade your stable for 15,000 gold.
[48:49.92]This will unlock these two.
[48:53.99]Wait, I have to have a certain amount of money on one day?
[48:56.61]Oh.
[48:56.67]Okay.
[48:59.35]Okay, one of these is I have to achieve a rank 4 breeder.
[49:12.34]And then I have to finish the expedition at Corea.
[49:17.86]So you have to send somebody that's at least B rank to do the heavy errantry.
[49:23.18]which is the Mandi Desert, between the months of March and August.
[49:30.01]If the monster is uninjured, it will return with a spear.
[49:33.01]Your monster and the centaur will fight.
[49:36.09]This will take an entire week, so you'll lose lifespan.
[49:39.05]Afterwards, you may use the spear and combining to unlock the centaur.
[49:41.77]There's no particular penalty.
[49:43.13]What the fuck is all this?
[49:44.41]Alright.
[49:50.79]So, um, cool.
[49:55.43]Very cool.
[49:56.33]You did a great job.
[50:00.63]Oh, this is kind of spoilery.
[50:01.81]Maybe I shouldn't be reading this.
[50:04.06]I want a silk cloth.
[50:07.80]Yeah, sure, whatever.
[50:13.72]Some of these are spoilery and some of these are literally impossible unless I did it step by step.
[50:20.09]What are some of the easier ones?
[50:27.30]Okay.
[50:30.92]You must be on the ranch one week four of May to trigger events.
[50:39.52]Okay.
[50:49.33]The FIMBA versus IMA is every four years.
[50:59.74]Centaur is really easy to get.
[51:00.74]Oh, somebody's here.
[51:07.50]Hello, it's an express mail from IMA.
[51:09.83]Oh, here we go.
[51:13.51]This is us being ranked for.
[51:16.53]Nice.
[51:18.13]The expedition ones are pretty straightforward.
[51:21.25]I'll do those ones first.
[51:22.07]These other ones seem kind of confusing.
[51:27.85]Alright, we're ranked for.
[51:29.11]Cool.
[51:32.77]Why are you playing with a Minecraft block?
[51:34.33]That Minecraft block is one-hit killing every single monster.
[51:41.08]So I need to get- I need to purchase a house upgrade.
[51:47.16]Remember for expeditions you'll need to have your monster to have high life and high fame.
[51:54.26]He's at 100 fame right now.
[51:58.21]Okay.
[52:04.51]How do I get the first house upgrade?
[52:08.57]It's January.
[52:10.33]January, February.
[52:11.55]When do I get to do this?
[52:14.43]His life stat's really low.
[52:15.88]You need high strength, life, and intelligence.
[52:19.32]How am I supposed to do that?
[52:22.02]Have lots of money and just wait.
[52:23.54]Okay.
[52:27.54]Let's keep the training going then.
[52:29.14]I might be able to do A rank next time.
[52:30.48]When's the next day?
[52:30.98]Wednesday.
[52:31.20]Wednesday.
[52:34.04]This one's four grand.
[52:34.94]Alright, here we go.
[52:37.04]The official A cup is in a couple months.
[52:43.68]You should have a separate expedition monster.
[52:45.61]Alright.
[52:52.19]I love this.
[52:52.77]This is so much fun.
[52:53.41]Okay.
[52:53.51]Should I just start banking money?
[53:01.84]I mean, do I just rest and then just do this and just bank money to make sure I can afford the house upgrade?
[53:06.35]Alright, let's do that.
[53:09.59]Just go wipe the floor with everybody in B rank.
[53:11.41]They're a bunch of shitties.
[53:12.65]They're never gonna make it.
[53:14.47]Just go there and fucking wipe the floor with them.
[53:30.54]There we go.
[53:30.90]This is for... Just four grand?
[53:32.81]This is quick, too.
[53:33.71]This is a lower-grade tourney?
[53:37.09]What?
[53:39.63]Your monster's fame will drop.
[53:41.03]Will it?
[53:45.40]Maybe I shouldn't do this.
[53:53.42]Never mind.
[53:53.82]Who cares?
[53:55.74]Make the money.
[53:56.80]Just do it.
[53:59.47]Alright, let's do it.
[53:59.91]I don't care.
[54:00.31]I need money.
[54:10.55]Oh, the Sirius Cup.
[54:17.05]Smurfing.
[54:19.51]I gotta try to get to at least 10 to 20,000.
[54:25.24]Then that makes the next monster so much easier to train.
[54:27.44]I don't have to worry about anything.
[54:29.09]I would kill a lot of these guys in one hit.
[54:31.23]We're fine.
[54:31.51]Alright.
[54:47.54]Give me that money.
[54:55.53]You're going back to middle school to beat up children.
[54:58.65]That's not accurate.
[55:02.17]Going back to middle school to beat up children would be doing E rank.
[55:06.11]Or D rank.
[55:07.00]This is B rank.
[55:09.38]These are grown-ups.
[55:10.02]Not as good as me.
[55:21.54]It's kind of unfair.
[55:22.32]You basically just made a gun.
[55:27.15]What is that move that they have?
[55:31.67]What's that like Verizon tower signal?
[55:39.31]What does that move do?
[55:46.21]It's a 5G move?
[55:51.21]What's the T-Mobile data thing do?
[56:03.60]This one was quick.
[56:15.06]Called Soundwave.
[56:15.76]It has an S-rank hit rate, but it's weak.
[56:19.63]I actually might want that.
[56:22.45]Because if you miss, then it sucks.
[56:27.35]Being able to guaranteed hit at least to have some damage.
[56:32.60]Ooh, confused.
[56:33.24]It would have been scary if I didn't have... High intelligence.
[56:43.06]Alright, this is easy money.
[57:09.35]This is easy money for you guys too, I imagine.
[57:12.25]Some of you guys, I don't know... Yeah, five and a half million versus 150k.
[57:15.65]I mean, the 150k is looking for the huge payout, but... I don't think that's gonna happen.
[57:26.00]4500 bucks.
[57:29.64]Don't drop by that much, right?
[57:31.56]Okay.
[57:32.86]I'm gonna keep doing B ranks.
[57:34.66]Especially the four monster ones.
[57:40.18]And I keep getting bonuses and shit.
[57:42.22]This is awesome.
[57:51.61]I want polish.
[57:54.37]Finally got over 10 grand.
[57:55.75]Um... Yeah, fine.
[58:01.58]Made 15 grand, you said, right?
[58:02.70]What, 20 grand?
[58:12.76]Who's the next one?
[58:15.82]Free-for-all elimination.
[58:18.79]Can I hang here?
[58:19.53]Do you think I could do it?
[58:20.35]Or is this going to be way too hard?
[58:27.53]Probably not.
[58:27.93]Okay.
[58:31.11]Is this one here?
[58:32.01]Ooh, five grand and only four entries and it's B. Perfect.
[58:36.22]Alright, let's rest.
[58:38.28]Heavy train.
[58:40.90]Oh, no, fuck it.
[58:41.94]Why?
[58:42.18]Heavy train.
[58:44.18]Who needs to sleep when you can do this?
[58:46.87]Remember, my wife is divorcing me because I lost all my channel points because of Cosmic Andy.
[58:59.37]What the fuck?
[59:01.63]Very, very weird thing to be divorced for.
[59:04.19]I feel like there's more going on.
[59:11.34]I don't think it's just the fact that Cosmic Andy lost you channel point.
[59:21.63]Okay, let's go.
[59:30.15]He was joking.
[59:32.95]How am I supposed to know that?
[59:37.24]Come on.
[59:38.32]No!
[59:48.12]It's alright.
[59:51.77]You're well, that's fine.
[59:53.29]Let's go ahead and do the mint leaf for your stretch.
[60:01.63]Please throw the next fight so we can get a huge payout on people that are doubters.
[60:09.26]Eh.
[60:09.38]I want the money.
[60:11.98]Sorry.
[60:15.01]Alright, I got this week and then next week.
[60:16.99]So we'll do another big training.
[60:18.21]And then we'll rest.
[60:22.61]And not... No.
[60:23.89]Yeah.
[60:24.11]Don't fail it again.
[60:26.71]Really... Well, now it's a rest week.
[60:49.47]tablets.
[60:50.43]Just do the A tournament.
[60:52.99]Somebody said that the A tournament might be way too difficult right now.
[60:59.19]You're ignoring chat.
[61:02.73]Why do you think I read chat?
[61:06.53]I don't even look.
[61:08.81]I have not looked at the chat in probably like two or three years streaming.
[61:14.14]I don't even look.
[61:16.90]I just kind of guess what you guys might be talking about, and then I just kind of blend in.
[61:21.24]Alright, we need to rest.
[61:29.39]We're just going for A. Let's go.
[61:30.71]I don't even care.
[61:32.75]Train a shitload, and we're going right to A. Rest up.
[61:39.41]Let's go.
[61:51.32]Alright, come on, let's see it.
[61:52.72]Train.
[61:54.64]Get over 700 intelligence.
[61:56.14]Nice.
[62:11.39]The A tournament will be too late for the house upgrade, as I've understood it.
[62:15.00]You have to have the money by the first week of March.
[62:20.45]Level down defense, shit.
[62:23.63]Don't I have the money, though?
[62:28.74]First week of March.
[62:29.64]I have 10 grand.
[62:30.62]Isn't it like... There's two upgrades.
[62:33.16]I don't have the first one.
[62:36.00]It's 15... I don't have the first upgrade.
[62:39.77]It's May for the first one.
[62:43.45]There's two upgrades.
[62:44.99]There's a house upgrade and a stable upgrade.
[62:49.29]It's May 4th.
[62:50.31]First one is 15k.
[62:52.90]May, not March.
[62:53.88]Oh, okay.
[62:54.64]Well, I think I'm alright.
[62:59.98]Yeah, I'm good.
[63:06.35]Wait, I need a stress release.
[63:21.67]It's guilt.
[63:25.79]You need 7k for the first one.
[63:27.27]Okay.
[63:27.75]I have that.
[63:32.31]Press release?
[63:33.09]No, I said stress relief.
[63:37.38]Ah, shit.
[63:37.78]We gotta do a press release.
[63:38.84]I gotta do a press release.
[63:42.92]Cosmic Calamity.
[63:43.68]I gotta be Cosmic Calamity's PR person.
[64:01.43]Comes a bit.
[64:03.63]Oh, not really.
[64:16.40]Right.
[64:19.50]Yes, come on.
[64:21.46]Well, that's good enough.
[64:23.90]I need a facecam.
[64:26.93]I need a facecam.
[64:29.53]You know exactly what I look like.
[64:33.30]No, you don't have to count my nose hairs.
[64:35.08]You know what my face looks like right now.
[64:44.55]I want the stress reduction.
[64:45.41]Official tournaments at the end of the month.
[64:53.36]Okay, keep going.
[65:01.04]I need items, alright.
[65:03.21]Make sure I have over $7,000, though.
[65:08.43]I might actually be getting to the end of the training regimen.
[65:13.13]In my understanding here, this is accurate.
[65:16.37]Eventually, they stop getting, like, really even worth training stat increases.
[65:22.66]Like, less than two or three of them, like, per stat increase.
[65:25.80]It's no longer, oh, plus ten, plus twenty stats.
[65:28.24]It's like plus three.
[65:30.88]So, probably getting close.
[65:32.48]Maybe this one or two more weeks.
[65:40.57]Yeah, definitely falling out of prime at this point.
[66:00.11]Heard about you from Reddit.
[66:02.28]Everybody hears about me from every place that I don't participate in.
[66:05.24]Alright, let's do a big one.
[66:22.85]I close my eyes every time you do a facecam.
[66:26.83]Let's put like a post-it note on your screen where the facecam is.
[66:31.08]700 intelligence, finally, got it.
[66:33.74]Yes.
[66:35.52]Now I can beat A rank.
[66:36.98]I can just laser beam, just lightning melt everybody.
[66:51.53]You don't participate in Reddit?
[66:54.03]I read it sometimes.
[66:55.07]I'm not an active participator in Reddit though.
[67:01.28]20 weeks we got, we got this one.
[67:04.30]This is a skill.
[67:07.28]Skill.
[67:08.50]Rest.
[67:09.54]A. Nice.
[67:20.35]350 or so.
[67:22.91]Alright, good.
[67:41.41]Rest.
[67:43.20]A rank.
[67:43.58]That's what this- I made this title.
[67:47.42]The title says A rank.
[67:49.22]So I better beat it.
[67:49.92]Let me save the game in case I get instantly killed and die.
[68:01.39]You know what I mean?
[68:04.65]Whoa!
[68:07.19]What happened?
[68:07.95]Oh, whoops.
[68:14.50]Okay.
[68:18.94]This is the big one.
[68:19.78]I've never done this before.
[68:25.28]I've... I used to play this game when I was like 16.
[68:29.63]I never got this far.
[68:30.45]Played this game again a few years ago.
[68:34.55]Did not get this far.
[68:38.69]See if I can do this.
[68:44.19]You could do an Errantry and get the Soundwave.
[68:46.01]It's a 100% chance at this point.
[68:51.86]Oh, I'm kind of nervous.
[68:56.42]Kaplan.
[68:58.48]Kaplan.
[69:05.44]What is that?
[69:06.22]Okay.
[69:06.52]Whoa.
[69:06.68]585 speed?
[69:07.40]Oh, God.
[69:17.80]Only 200... Okay.
[69:20.92]I'm never gonna hit this thing.
[69:26.39]Can I even hit this?
[69:29.35]Oh, I hit you!
[69:30.07]Oh, you... Oh, I got an onion!
[69:32.49]Oh, an onion ring!
[69:38.22]I blew his head off!
[69:40.06]I blew his head off.
[69:41.86]What the fuck?
[69:44.90]Oh my god, the force behind that one.
[69:52.63]30% chance.
[69:53.33]I had to hit that arrow.
[69:54.47]It was over it.
[69:55.27]By the way... I'm probably gonna lose this tournament.
[69:59.21]Because we're not gonna get lucky again like that.
[70:03.84]That was a pog moment, but -2.
[70:06.78]I know, I just... I heard the exact same sound.
[70:09.26]It was that like... You have to fight a dragon.
[70:21.22]Oh boy.
[70:25.42]These are all pretty rare monsters, it seems.
[70:27.38]Alright.
[70:32.01]Dragon.
[70:34.65]I'm scared.
[70:37.27]Oh my god.
[70:38.85]600 powers?
[70:44.52]600 intelligence?
[70:45.10]How do you even do that?
[70:49.14]How do you have that much training time to get it there?
[70:52.10]I think this is a loss.
[70:52.88]Let's have faith, though.
[70:58.46]Have faith, have faith, have faith.
[70:59.45]Don't let him get up.
[70:59.95]Do it again.
[71:00.93]Have faith, have faith.
[71:02.15]I just beat this motherfucker.
[71:02.95]I just killed him.
[71:04.15]That was the guy to beat right there, and I just won.
[71:13.86]Nothing can stop the laser beam.
[71:19.71]Those were low percentage chances too.
[71:29.13]Although, I don't know.
[71:29.97]Some of these other things could be high... High intelligence, high power.
[71:34.15]That was the worst possible thing.
[71:39.06]That dragon just had to do one move and I lose.
[71:45.54]I'm surprised he's not playing the Monster Rancher DX.
[71:47.58]This is... This is Monster Rancher DX.
[71:51.04]This is the one that just came out.
[71:56.52]Team Wall, yeah.
[72:01.56]Alright.
[72:02.22]Arculon.
[72:02.72]This is also 2-0.
[72:05.52]Arculon.
[72:06.36]You got a cool name, too.
[72:07.36]Hmm.
[72:17.69]Wait, this is a robot-scorpion hybrid?
[72:21.50]That thing is awesome.
[72:24.24]Alright, but it's just no match for the flip a coin and you die.
[72:28.66]Oh, I can do the same thing, you know.
[72:34.55]You know, I can do the same thing.
[72:35.31]It's over.
[72:37.41]It's over.
[72:43.09]Shit.
[72:46.61]Okay.
[72:50.50]Okay.
[72:52.68]It's still winnable, it is.
[72:53.84]As long as Arculon loses once.
[72:56.10]Okay.
[73:14.25]More... The dragon won.
[73:16.07]I'm not the only person that beat the dragon.
[73:19.01]Just by sheer luck.
[73:22.83]Okay, Lamb Suite.
[73:26.38]This is a must-win scenario here.
[73:36.24]That speed.
[73:37.08]This is a must-win.
[73:38.48]Come on, let's go.
[73:39.28]Flip the coin.
[73:44.11]Oh, boy.
[73:45.33]Oh, no.
[73:49.15]Oh, no.
[74:01.05]No.
[74:03.55]We just got lucky on the first two.
[74:11.96]Most people have lost twice.
[74:13.18]This is not over yet.
[74:14.50]Alright.
[74:21.62]Arculon needs to lose.
[74:24.98]Alright.
[74:26.81]Okay.
[74:28.79]It's still doable.
[74:31.11]Alright, Sharken has not won a single match, so I'm not that concerned.
[74:46.08]How?
[74:49.83]60% chance, let's go.
[74:53.09]You got that off first?
[74:53.95]Are you shitting me?
[74:55.35]You fucking piece of crap.
[74:56.89]Are you kidding me?
[74:57.87]You saw him?
[74:58.27]I was spamming it.
[75:00.37]Give me a break.
[75:01.67]I'm sitting here spamming the button.
[75:11.16]Yeah, it's over.
[75:12.76]I'm just going to reload the save.
[75:15.30]Screw that.
[75:19.51]I'm reloading the save.
[75:29.34]Okay, if I don't bank- if I don't get any prize money, I'm reloading the save.
[75:41.51]That's not even the move I wanted to do!
[75:53.15]Oh shit.
[75:59.04]Fuck.
[76:00.00]I'm reloading.
[76:03.76]I'm reloading.
[76:05.24]I'm done.
[76:06.68]I just wanted to see if I could at least do A rank.
[76:13.88]This doesn't even count.
[76:14.70]Like, I was just checking.
[76:18.75]This doesn't count.
[76:19.21]I was checking.
[76:23.93]We're going back into training.
[76:34.43]I just need to level speed a little bit.
[76:46.15]Stream title is clickbait.
[76:47.28]No, it's not.
[76:47.96]I got to A rank.
[76:48.88]I didn't say I was going to beat A rank.
[77:03.38]No, that's not enough.
[77:08.33]That's just a waste of time, we could've been training.
[77:15.77]We could've been training.
[77:18.37]When was the last time I saved the game?
[77:20.53]Oh my god, wait, I just fed him a potato.
[77:22.25]When was the last time I saved?
[77:23.58]Did I save right before that?
[77:28.82]Oh no.
[77:30.18]Okay.
[77:35.24]Never feed a potato.
[77:36.68]Ever.
[77:44.34]Yeah, fuck this.
[77:47.86]Let's go.
[77:49.68]Okay, we're not doing that.
[77:51.04]Uh, instead... Yes, rank.
[77:53.08]No thanks.
[77:54.02]Back to the training.
[77:59.07]Should I just do an Errantry?
[78:09.89]Do B for the money?
[78:10.57]B for the money?
[78:15.89]That's only 3,000 for eight.
[78:20.19]Eight entries?
[78:20.85]I need the money.
[78:23.57]That's going to take a long time.
[78:24.59]Alright, fine.
[78:25.77]Let's just go farm this.
[78:26.47]Speedrun.
[78:35.75]We don't care about what everybody's stats are.
[78:37.39]All we care about is mashing A and hopefully the beam hits them.
[78:46.87]These are new monsters.
[78:51.76]Alright, this is easy.
[78:52.84]Whoa, look at this.
[78:53.40]I think it's cool.
[78:59.76]Alright, come on.
[79:01.61]I've spammed it.
[79:03.01]I've been spamming it.
[79:04.39]What the fuck?
[79:05.89]No more swearing.
[79:22.57]He said, realistically, your attack is A plus right now in power, but you need either high dodge or defense to counter that RNG.
[79:33.00]Yeah, I think it's probably going to have to be speed.
[79:36.14]We'll just work on speed for a little bit.
[79:39.02]I'm just going to hammer speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, and just make him drink nuts oil.
[79:50.22]I don't think we need... Okay.
[79:53.82]I don't need any more intelligence.
[79:57.63]I should solely be focusing on trying to get speed over 200 or 300, right?
[80:01.61]That's it.
[80:10.28]Okay.
[80:16.70]That's cool looking too.
[80:22.87]Shit.
[80:29.04]Oh, that's not good.
[80:29.84]Alright, I need to hold back.
[80:32.61]Try to stay back.
[80:40.65]Didn't even do anything.
[80:45.31]That was a dinosaur, by the way.
[80:46.81]That was not even a dog.
[80:50.53]That was a T-Rex.
[81:07.08]People are saying, what are you talking about?
[81:08.90]That was not a lion.
[81:09.74]It was a stegosaurus.
[81:15.59]Alright, this is a one-hit kill.
[81:27.55]Guaranteed.
[81:42.83]You realize that they didn't sample actual dinosaur sounds, right?
[81:49.17]How do we even know what dinosaurs sounded like?
[81:53.49]We've given them these crazy big roars, the T-Rex roar and big growls.
[81:57.34]What are they saying?
[82:00.90]Like birds.
[82:08.30]I met T-Rex probably was like,
[82:13.80]They were probably birds.
[82:14.96]Aren't they like descendants from birds?
[82:30.01]Birds or dinosaurs?
[82:31.21]No, I'm serious.
[82:35.06]There are a lot of experts that think we have dinosaurs all wrong.
[82:38.40]They may have had just feathers all over them.
[82:39.84]They weren't like these lizard-skinned animals.
[82:43.07]They may have had feathers all over them.
[82:48.21]Oh, let me just kill this guy real quick.
[82:54.87]Wow, that was a cool move.
[82:56.66]Come on.
[82:59.54]Dinosaurs were feathered, yeah.
[83:04.17]Okay, wait, let me pay attention because I somehow just got hurt.
[83:08.45]Bad.
[83:10.41]Don't let this guy win.
[83:11.63]Come on.
[83:13.17]Don't let him win.
[83:17.61]I just hit him once.
[83:18.63]24 guts.
[83:20.89]Do it.
[83:21.95]Yeah.
[83:29.39]T-Rex didn't roar.
[83:32.88]Kinda... thrummed?
[83:36.42]What is... thrum?
[83:42.16]A thrum?
[83:50.61]Like that?
[83:52.23]I didn't mean to do that, but... I just got to the end of the coffee.
[84:06.69]Wait, let me take a guess.
[84:08.35]Is thrumming like this, like... Is that what it might be?
[84:15.29]Kind of like use your throat and your vocal cords with your mouth closed a little bit.
[84:28.54]Like the Velociraptors do in Jurassic Park.
[84:39.04]It's like the rumbling alligators make.
[84:40.70]Oh, okay.
[84:46.97]Got five health.
[84:48.13]Alright, let's just insult this person.
[84:54.04]Oh, no.
[84:54.56]Okay, good.
[84:55.00]Did my BM work?
[85:02.89]So you're talking about the sound that sounds like an alligator when they open their mouth and they make a noise.
[85:06.94]It sounds like they're releasing steam from their body.
[85:10.00]Or that they have a gas leak inside of their throat.
[85:24.61]No, that's a hiss.
[85:31.10]It's a low croak.
[85:34.26]I mean like this.
[85:39.15]All of you just prepared.
[85:40.07]Just wincing, waiting for that noise.
[85:45.04]And I even see somebody said -2 because you wanted to be the first one to write it.
[85:50.36]But I didn't do anything, so.
[85:53.99]Look a little silly now, don't you?
[86:07.95]I want one of these big dogs.
[86:15.81]Alright, there's the money.
[86:22.42]I imagined it and it made me cringe, so -2.
[86:24.84]Yeah, these take too long.
[86:39.61]Just to get three or four thousand bucks?
[86:41.79]This is too long.
[86:42.71]I'd rather just train him.
[86:53.54]I like those little snail guys.
[86:55.88]How do I get one of those?
[86:56.52]Did you do the fast forward mode?
[87:08.67]There is a fast forward mode.
[87:11.47]I don't want to do fast forward mode.
[87:12.57]I feel like I would accidentally screw something up and I would just die.
[87:22.58]The snail guy sucks.
[87:27.66]Looks cool.
[87:28.14]Fast forward is good when you train.
[87:32.98]Okay.
[87:35.11]Okay.
[87:36.75]The Papa's Bee Cup in July, it's worth 9,000 bucks and it gives you pure gold.
[87:41.01]Alright.
[87:45.23]If this has to be the Money Farm character to get ready for the real character, I'm fine with that.
[87:49.74]Okay.
[88:00.22]We got up to 9 speed.
[88:01.44]That's exactly what I wanted to have happen.
[88:03.24]And the health.
[88:03.88]That's good.
[88:12.57]I want polish.
[88:14.11]Yeah, you deserve it.
[88:23.64]This stream is very cozy.
[88:27.18]That's nice.
[88:29.12]Sometimes it's fun just to play a game and hang out.
[88:35.65]Alright, I need some help from the Lore Masters.
[88:37.35]Is tablets still worth doing at this point?
[88:40.15]Or should I just feed Cup of Jelly for the stress?
[88:41.81]I need some Lore Master help.
[88:51.52]Please don't try to level speed.
[88:53.70]Cosmic Speed is literally one of the worst in the entire game.
[88:57.80]Its defense is pretty good though.
[89:00.02]Really.
[89:04.75]Ablitz is also stress minus.
[89:06.17]Okay.
[89:10.15]So wait.
[89:10.51]They have the worst speed in the game.
[89:13.39]Does that also mean they train the worst for speed?
[89:21.52]Yes.
[89:21.92]Okay.
[89:22.24]So then what do I do?
[89:23.68]Do I just have to really rely on just keeping intelligence and skill high enough so I can be the first person to attack and kill somebody in one hit?
[89:35.65]Defense is worthless.
[89:41.59]Defense.
[89:41.97]People are saying defense, but I've heard that defense is not good.
[89:47.81]That's why galaxy is bad.
[89:49.78]So this is why this is the worst character in the game.
[89:52.50]Okay, I'm beginning to understand.
[89:57.12]Because you can't really level these up because he sucks.
[90:02.20]And you get really shit increases when you do.
[90:06.88]I get it.
[90:09.44]That's why nobody plays with this guy.
[90:12.22]I need to get a new skill.
[90:13.02]Alright.
[90:13.70]I'm just going to do Errantry.
[90:15.70]What's there?
[90:16.12]What is it?
[90:17.78]Let's go for it.
[90:18.36]Let's do an Errantry.
[90:19.74]I mean, it's $2,000 though.
[90:21.26]Okay, I'll do this one.
[90:32.88]Just make him the money maker.
[90:33.98]That's a good idea.
[90:34.88]Yeah.
[90:38.39]But the double beam, as long as I keep using beam, Raise Life is the most important defensive stat in the game.
[90:50.48]Okay, so I got a few options here.
[90:53.66]One of the ways to make this character really, really okay is if I keep doing the beam move.
[91:01.55]After I do it 50 times, I can then do an Errantry and get double beam.
[91:09.38]But I already kill things in one hit anyways, or two hits.
[91:16.87]Do I really need the double beam?
[91:18.35]DC?
[91:24.99]Oh, okay.
[91:27.65]Look at his gain.
[91:28.37]His life is D. His defense gain is B, the same as your intelligence gain.
[91:36.67]His life gain is D, defense is B. Okay.
[91:40.65]You're literally at 49 out of 50 beam usages.
[91:43.81]Okay.
[91:46.39]Yes, do it.
[91:46.89]It's content.
[91:47.49]Okay.
[91:47.61]That's all I needed to hear.
[91:50.20]So, I need to do this at the end of the month to just do the 50, um... He's leaving.
[91:56.42]He's not leaving.
[91:57.36]His ranch is huge.
[91:59.50]He promised a facecam in a minute.
[92:04.71]Alright, I'm gonna... Let's do training.
[92:10.56]Do I have any more oil?
[92:11.42]I do.
[92:15.20]So, should I just do heavy life training then?
[92:18.28]Or should I just spam life increase?
[92:29.17]Which is just run.
[92:30.91]Just do run over and over again?
[92:38.06]Do defense, do defense, do defense.
[92:42.22]Defense and life?
[92:43.08]Should I just do swim?
[92:44.98]Defense, you dolt.
[92:49.07]Life will make him expedition capable.
[92:50.89]Maybe I'll just do swim.
[92:55.63]I should get it.
[92:57.97]Don't swim.
[93:01.68]This is late game shit.
[93:02.74]I don't know what to do.
[93:04.20]I've never gotten this far.
[93:10.63]You dolt.
[93:12.77]I'm gonna do swim.
[93:15.08]Swim is minus intelligence.
[93:16.48]Oh shit, you're right.
[93:17.22]Alright.
[93:17.48]Alright, I'm just gonna run.
[93:21.28]Just run.
[93:21.80]Just go run.
[93:25.44]Meditate only.
[93:34.25]Oh, yucky.
[93:36.33]Ugly.
[93:37.29]Three?
[93:37.75]Huh?
[93:38.57]Huh?
[93:40.54]Three?
[93:41.26]That's it?
[93:41.68]Because he's getting old.
[93:54.13]Upgrade intelligence and skill to become an actual one-shot sniper.
[94:02.65]Please train defense.
[94:05.43]Hold on.
[94:05.83]I need to sneeze.
[94:08.37]See if I can... Can I catch it?
[94:15.11]Did I get it?
[94:22.12]Did I not get it?
[94:22.78]Yeah, I did, didn't I?
[94:34.28]Alright, I don't know what to do.
[94:35.60]Uh...
[94:42.36]Speed and intelligence?
[94:44.78]Just keep running?
[94:45.48]Defense is better than you think.
[94:49.83]It's against intelligence and power.
[94:51.65]INT and POW just also scale damage resistance against themselves slightly.
[94:56.49]Alright, I'm gonna go for it.
[95:01.32]I'm gonna do endure.
[95:02.34]Endure.
[95:04.08]Let's check it.
[95:13.18]success, right?
[95:16.91]That's four defense.
[95:18.35]That's not good, man.
[95:29.71]Double beam has worse accuracy and you don't need the damage.
[95:32.65]Sound wave has the best accuracy in the game.
[95:34.53]Get sound wave instead.
[95:35.89]Alright, where do I go for sound wave?
[95:43.35]Just choose one with your eyes closed.
[95:47.64]Soundwave sucks.
[95:55.12]You guys have a lot of different opinions.
[95:56.81]Should I just send him on an Errantry and who cares?
[95:59.05]We haven't had a discount in the whole time we've been playing.
[96:13.09]Go to the beach and get Soundwave.
[96:14.41]I'm going to the beach and I'm getting Soundwave.
[96:19.97]Rest.
[96:25.33]Don't miss the house upgrade.
[96:30.78]Yes, who is it?
[96:32.10]You have mail.
[96:35.40]Look at this.
[96:36.92]Oh, it's Erintre, isn't it?
[96:45.85]That's not bad, though.
[96:48.63]Alright, April.
[96:50.29]So, help me out here.
[96:52.63]When does this happen?
[96:54.85]The first week of May?
[96:57.79]So, I need to just stay here.
[97:03.22]The fourth week of May.
[97:06.88]So, I need to be on the ranch here.
[97:09.60]So, we're going to continue to train.
[97:15.02]Or...
[97:15.80]I'll just do this.
[97:17.68]And just get money.
[97:30.57]The video for this stream is going to be five minutes long.
[97:32.53]No, it's not.
[97:34.58]It's going to be like 30 minutes.
[97:35.92]Alright, this will be easy money.
[97:50.75]I need 17k to activate it.
[97:54.93]Will I have it after this match?
[97:56.11]Because I was at 12, 13, 14, 15.
[97:59.29]I'll be at 15.
[98:00.54]Alright, that's not good.
[98:12.52]How do you... 93% chance and they missed.
[98:13.87]Alright, would you fuck off with this bullshit already?
[98:18.55]Really?
[98:18.81]Am I actually going to lose?
[98:21.98]No, I'm not.
[98:22.34]Don't forget to scream in five minutes to wake that person up for you.
[98:41.65]Oh, it's a single elimination.
[98:45.37]Alright.
[98:48.10]This one was really easy.
[98:53.19]What about the toxic monster?
[98:54.33]Yeah, I just have to be able to unlock it.
[99:01.52]That was a 500 damage crit.
[99:04.94]I feel bad.
[99:18.07]We need to put a poll in the chat.
[99:20.94]very important because I can now get the strongest beam move in the game right I can go get double beam do I get double beam which is more damage than single beam but less accurate and we actually just go for 30 40 kill everybody in one hit
[99:47.19]Or do we go get Scream?
[99:49.29]Which is almost a guaranteed hit.
[99:51.61]But doesn't do as much damage.
[99:58.92]I think we need a pull for this.
[100:00.14]Because I don't know either one I would be fine with.
[100:13.89]You lose single beam.
[100:14.89]You do not.
[100:19.11]Whoa.
[100:22.69]This is getting me more increases than if I were to heavily train the character.
[100:31.90]Holy shit.
[100:34.92]Do double beam for extra braindead build.
[100:39.12]Uh, have some tablets.
[100:47.72]Alright, I got 15 grand.
[100:54.62]What do we got?
[100:57.44]Looks like pretty unanimously people do not want double beam.
[101:00.36]They want scream.
[101:10.39]Just get double beam and then save scum until it works.
[101:12.51]I forgot to buy this shit.
[101:20.35]Wait, what is this?
[101:22.21]What kind of seed is this?
[101:25.39]I don't know.
[101:25.81]Thank you, Auntie.
[101:27.35]What does that do?
[101:27.87]Holy smokes.
[101:57.60]Do I have to grow it?
[101:58.26]How do I do that?
[102:15.09]In like three years.
[102:17.45]Okay, never mind.
[102:18.65]Because this is going to take a long time.
[102:33.85]It's 10 years, actually.
[102:37.77]Oh.
[102:40.83]Alright, we got... I can't do... Wait, there's only four entries.
[102:45.09]Okay, Errantry.
[102:49.82]Errantry, then we're going for... We're going for A rank again.
[102:55.06]Errantry.
[102:56.92]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[102:58.20]Don't do that because the... Right, okay.
[103:04.72]Alright, speed and intelligence.
[103:05.94]What do you think?
[103:07.62]Let's do leap.
[103:09.69]Power down?
[103:10.31]Who gives a shit?
[103:11.27]I need speed.
[103:11.99]Nice.
[103:26.92]I'm not training anymore.
[103:28.08]There's no reason to.
[103:28.68]That does so much fatigue and so much stress for barely any gain at all.
[103:36.86]Just have to do the tournaments now.
[103:39.13]Wait.
[103:39.49]Let's bury the seed in the corner of the ranch.
[103:44.67]I wonder what kind of plant it is.
[103:46.63]Let's wait patiently and see.
[103:47.83]Let's wait for 10 years.
[103:58.06]Oh, fuck it.
[103:58.40]I think I'm going for it.
[103:58.96]I'm going to save here.
[103:59.58]I'm going to rest.
[104:00.02]We're going to see if I can win.
[104:02.12]It's only four people.
[104:06.38]Save the game.
[104:14.32]I can get lucky four times.
[104:20.88]Hold on, should I do... Okay, rest today.
[104:38.27]A rank has insanely fast monsters.
[104:39.87]It's all going to be about coin flips.
[104:42.61]I think... I mean, it's only four monsters, though.
[104:44.90]I beat two in a row.
[104:45.96]I beat two in a row.
[104:53.59]The dragon was insane.
[104:54.93]It was horrifying.
[104:55.91]I beat it in one hit.
[104:59.19]Ray, I beg of you, it's your best move.
[105:03.67]Well, one thing at a time.
[105:13.28]I don't remember beating any of these people, but we have improved since the last time.
[105:17.28]Alright, it's just, it's flip a coin.
[105:21.51]Let's go.
[105:21.85]I just have to get it right now.
[105:28.47]Again, do it.
[105:30.23]It's over.
[105:34.57]Yes!
[105:34.79]Uh-oh.
[105:36.80]What do I do?
[105:38.60]Stay back?
[105:40.80]Stay back, stay back, stay back, stay back.
[105:42.74]Dodge it.
[105:46.79]Oy.
[105:48.81]Oh.
[105:51.15]Dodge it, please.
[105:53.53]I have health.
[105:53.93]19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.
[105:55.37]Fuck you.
[105:55.75]Whatever.
[106:08.38]You literally only have one chance a year to get Ray.
[106:11.54]It's June 1st.
[106:12.54]Please do whatever you can to get it.
[106:14.16]It's the Korea expedition.
[106:22.35]June 1st?
[106:32.87]I don't even have expeditions.
[106:34.63]How do I get those?
[106:48.38]How do I do that?
[106:51.08]They mean Errantry.
[106:51.84]Okay.
[106:52.06]Alright, let's get lucky here.
[106:58.06]Not happening.
[107:02.02]We need Ray.
[107:02.54]Bad.
[107:03.42]Holy shit.
[107:04.26]Okay.
[107:04.80]Well, whatever.
[107:05.38]I'm just going to relive the save.
[107:06.60]Fuck it.
[107:32.57]I have another game.
[107:36.05]Okay.
[107:39.19]So we're not doing that.
[107:41.45]I still can't do it.
[107:42.09]I do need to wait till the end of this month.
[107:50.42]So let's just rest or training.
[107:53.66]How about a straight up speed?
[108:02.12]Or...
[108:03.83]Speed.
[108:04.63]Just do it, whatever.
[108:05.49]Oh, that person needs to wake up, right?
[108:15.28]Hold on.
[108:20.95]Let me help.
[108:21.65]Plus one.
[108:22.41]Why even do any of these anymore?
[108:34.84]Alright, we gotta wake that person up.
[108:36.64]I got it.
[108:36.96]Don't worry.
[108:37.52]Come on, give me one sec.
[108:46.16]It's been two hours, right?
[108:47.90]It's too early?
[108:48.40]No, it's not.
[108:54.09]Too early.
[108:54.61]Okay.
[108:58.15]Let's do...
[109:08.57]It's 4 o'clock p.m.
[109:13.63]It's 4 o'clock p.m.
[109:21.72]You're up.
[109:27.73]Turn it off.
[109:28.59]Turn it off.
[109:34.09]I hate that alarm.
[109:34.89]Everybody does.
[109:38.50]I was sleeping.
[109:39.20]That was not a scream.
[109:42.62]I'm not gonna actually scream and like hurt your ears.
[109:47.89]Alright, just go to sleep.
[109:55.11]Just wake up tomorrow.
[110:06.70]Here we go.
[110:07.18]It's about our house.
[110:08.60]You know people say the might of the house is the might of the trainer.
[110:11.90]Our house is getting too small for us.
[110:14.53]We have money.
[110:16.47]So it'll cost 5,000 gold to renovate the house.
[110:20.21]Go for it.
[110:21.69]I will ask the carpenter.
[110:24.33]Jax, this is Binto, the carpenter.
[110:26.21]He's the number one carpenter around here.
[110:30.16]Stop it, Colt.
[110:31.86]Although our motto is fast, cheap, and detailed, you will not be disappointed.
[110:37.08]I'll be looking forward to seeing your job, Binto.
[110:40.28]Oh, but we cannot concentrate when someone comes into our sight.
[110:45.48]I have to ask you to visit somewhere while we are working.
[110:49.52]When we finish our job, I'll come and get you.
[110:51.32]Wait, what do you mean, leave?
[110:52.34]Got it.
[110:57.78]I asked to stay at the Pab's house.
[111:00.47]So don't worry.
[111:01.77]Of course, leave it to me.
[111:02.51]What does this actually do?
[111:06.28]How about that?
[111:07.62]Pretty neat, huh?
[111:09.88]Oh, you're done already?
[111:11.06]Told you Armada was fast, cheap, and detailed.
[111:14.20]I'll take the money.
[111:14.98]Ask us anytime.
[111:18.78]I don't know what to say.
[111:19.76]It's a good house, I guess.
[111:21.44]That takes care of all of it, huh?
[111:24.52]More inventory space.
[111:25.52]Ooh.
[111:27.50]Oh, it is a little house.
[111:28.38]That's cute.
[111:28.78]Are we sure that he didn't just go in there and move the furniture?
[111:39.28]Okay, somebody said 1st of June is the most important thing in the world.
[111:44.46]So I need to sleep here.
[111:46.06]Wait, that's sleeping two days in a row.
[111:47.46]Wait.
[111:53.47]Getting Cosmic's life to 140 or higher will let you go on the first expedition, which can potentially unlock a new monster.
[112:01.05]I have 140 health.
[112:02.49]Don't I?
[112:07.38]Dude, I got 187.
[112:07.98]Let's go back to sleep.
[112:19.41]Double rest.
[112:20.09]I don't care.
[112:23.19]187.
[112:23.25]You meet the requirements.
[112:24.09]You just need to be ready to go next week.
[112:25.93]Alright, I'm ready to go next week.
[112:28.56]He's nice and rested.
[112:37.48]I'm gonna do tablets.
[112:44.81]Check your house for asbestos and radon.
[112:46.49]Alright.
[112:54.23]Okay.
[112:55.37]Yes, who is it?
[112:57.35]Is this Jex's residence?
[112:59.25]Yes, it is.
[112:59.67]Who are you?
[113:00.03]Oh, this is my calling card.
[113:02.97]Oh, here we go.
[113:08.64]This is a serious question, dude.
[113:14.16]Do you have a carbon monoxide detector and does it work?
[113:16.06]Yes, I do.
[113:16.72]Don't worry.
[113:19.38]Yes, I do.
[113:20.50]I check my smoke detectors, my carbon monoxide detectors.
[113:24.36]Yes, don't worry.
[113:30.93]Okay, once upon a time when the world was one big continent, God sealed the monsters into disk stones and hid all the disk stones in a shrine.
[113:39.20]Is this when we say put us on the do not call list and close the door?
[113:45.50]I have ascertained that the legendary shrine is located on this continent.
[113:53.22]Aha.
[113:54.60]No, aha.
[113:55.60]It is a great discovery.
[113:58.89]Isn't that what aha means?
[113:59.93]I must go there.
[114:00.86]Well, what does it have to do with us?
[114:01.96]It looks like that.
[114:03.62]There are various obstacles on the way to the shrine.
[114:05.80]I want you guys to go on this adventure with me.
[114:10.34]I'll pay you and give you some of the items we find during the adventure.
[114:15.46]Huh?
[114:16.74]In order to get rid of those obstacles and proceed with this adventure, we have to use a monster.
[114:22.34]A strong monster, that is.
[114:24.62]I came here because Pabst told me.
[114:27.25]Oh, you know Pabbs.
[114:28.11]You should have said that in the beginning.
[114:30.63]Now I understand.
[114:31.35]Jax, your monster might get injured.
[114:34.25]Do you make it go with him?
[114:39.25]Yeah.
[114:41.09]You can now get the big dog.
[114:42.59]Really?
[114:44.11]Save the game?
[114:45.08]I don't think I can.
[114:45.62]I can't.
[114:57.42]You can get a phoenix from this.
[115:02.33]Is an auto-save?
[115:02.91]Okay.
[115:03.39]Let's go.
[115:04.69]I don't know what's going to happen.
[115:05.59]Something might injure your monster.
[115:06.77]Are you sure?
[115:09.81]Yes.
[115:10.03]Dr. Talco, we can let it go.
[115:14.49]That's just what I expected.
[115:16.73]Jax the Wonderful.
[115:17.59]Then can either Kaldor Jax come with me on the adventure?
[115:22.31]I can't handle your monster by myself.
[115:23.73]You don't even know my name.
[115:26.17]Okay, I'll go with you.
[115:27.95]Well done.
[115:28.95]Let's go.
[115:29.31]Are we all ready?
[115:31.59]Yeah.
[115:32.39]We better take off before you change your mind.
[115:34.17]Let's go.
[115:36.18]I'm leaving, Jex.
[115:39.66]Phoenix Volcano Adventure.
[115:41.14]Prologue to the adventure.
[115:43.66]We finally arrived at the Phoenix Volcano.
[115:49.22]First, let's set up a base camp.
[115:55.72]Okay, done.
[115:57.52]Let's get started.
[115:59.16]But before we start, let me explain a little about the adventure.
[116:02.25]At the beginning of an adventure, energy points will be given depending on your monster's life status.
[116:08.67]What?
[116:09.25]Energy?
[116:10.39]Yes, energy.
[116:10.99]This energy will be the life gauge for this adventure.
[116:15.33]The energy will be consumed with each step your monster makes.
[116:19.59]It'll also be reduced if the monster checks the inside of a building.
[116:25.19]or moves of rock that might be sitting in a way.
[116:29.96]This girl's confused about everything.
[116:35.30]So always pay attention to your monster's energy level as you proceed with your adventure.
[116:43.85]Come back to base camp while your monster still has some energy points.
[116:48.05]Wait, let me read this again.
[116:50.33]Come back to base camp while your monster still has some energy points hits minus 10.
[116:56.65]What's that telling me?
[116:57.35]What's that telling me?
[117:04.99]If you don't, the monster's lifespan will be shortened.
[117:08.05]Just don't let it hit minus 10.
[117:09.23]Okay, let's take off.
[117:14.29]Where do we go?
[117:14.71]Do I have to do this?
[117:17.88]Which way should I go?
[117:18.64]This seems very important.
[117:24.18]Go north?
[117:29.80]How do I move?
[117:30.64]Whoa.
[117:33.22]Left?
[117:36.50]Whoa, alright.
[117:37.44]Keep going?
[117:37.84]Where the fuck am I?
[117:56.84]The path is blocked and we can't go any further.
[117:58.48]Do you want Cosmic Calamity to move the obstacle?
[118:01.47]Yes.
[118:04.47]Nice.
[118:04.73]Okay, you're great.
[118:07.05]Change the camera.
[118:11.67]Oh.
[118:12.49]Where should I go?
[118:15.82]Up to the volcano?
[118:17.02]We're down.
[118:22.85]Off to the volcano.
[118:28.45]We can't go any further.
[118:31.07]Move that.
[118:31.49]Alright.
[118:36.44]Into the volcano?
[118:37.14]There's nowhere else I can go.
[118:43.76]Oh, there is an entrance here.
[118:48.18]Oh, I smell something in the cave.
[118:51.02]What do you smell?
[118:52.14]I don't mean that kind of smell.
[118:53.82]I feel something related to disk stones.
[118:55.88]Or how can I say... I have a feeling that monster's legend may be buried in here.
[119:02.66]Really?
[119:02.98]They usually say women's intuition.
[119:05.70]But I guess we should call it doctor's intuition this time.
[119:11.14]Well, shall we investigate it?
[119:12.50]Yes.
[119:19.86]Now what?
[119:20.28]What's that sound?
[119:26.93]Does it destroy the volcano?
[119:30.23]What is that thing and how do I get it?
[119:31.90]I want it right now and I want to use it.
[119:33.38]It's the next monster we're going to use.
[119:34.52]I want it right now.
[119:47.08]Oh, isn't that the legendary monster Phoenix, the guardian deity of the mountain?
[119:53.50]It's not just a legend, it's real and it's alive.
[119:56.28]I better let him know about it as soon as possible.
[119:59.43]Ooh, who are you going to tell about it?
[120:00.73]Huh?
[120:02.33]Oh, never mind.
[120:03.95]Anyway, seems like this is not the place I'm looking for.
[120:07.03]I wonder where that shrine of gods is.
[120:10.92]By the way, I wonder if cosmic calamity is alright.
[120:14.14]So shall we investigate inside again?
[120:17.82]Uh, yeah?
[120:21.32]What is this?
[120:25.65]That seems pretty far away to me.
[120:30.55]I just got something.
[120:31.25]I picked up something.
[120:32.07]I got something.
[120:33.35]A fucking bunch of bananas.
[120:35.43]No.
[120:35.51]Go back in.
[120:36.31]Go back in right now.
[120:37.87]Go back in.
[120:42.14]Get it.
[120:42.72]At the top.
[120:44.00]Nice.
[120:44.30]Okay, that's definitely it.
[120:46.12]Get something else too.
[120:52.42]Fire Feather, left by the legendary monster.
[120:56.12]If we investigate, we might be able to unravel the unknown secrets of the Phoenix.
[120:59.46]Should I keep going?
[121:08.61]Do I just pull him out?
[121:12.33]Leave, or you're going to hit minus 10.
[121:14.69]Okay, alright.
[121:15.25]I don't need anything else from in here.
[121:17.59]I'm actually really excited.
[121:18.65]I've never seen this before.
[121:19.57]Alright, let's pull it out.
[121:24.66]Alright.
[121:24.90]Let's go.
[121:26.50]Should I just leave?
[121:28.95]Pull about and check the HP.
[121:29.99]I have 65.
[121:30.75]Should I do it again?
[121:39.05]Remember, go mix something random with that and you'll get the phoenix.
[121:42.04]Are you serious?
[121:45.18]One more?
[121:47.34]One more!
[121:52.92]Come on.
[121:56.10]No, you idiot.
[122:01.93]Alright, get out.
[122:06.49]You're supposed to have 700 intelligence.
[122:08.97]I can do it again.
[122:10.95]One more.
[122:15.70]There it is.
[122:16.16]What do you got?
[122:20.32]Ooh, what did you get?
[122:21.84]I got a... No, get out.
[122:26.70]Now I just leave?
[122:33.04]If I go straight down, will that take me back?
[122:34.32]I have to go back to the entrance.
[122:46.33]I can't go down.
[122:46.83]Yeah, I can't go down.
[122:52.15]I have to go all the way around.
[122:57.01]I can't go down.
[123:03.42]I'm okay.
[123:03.76]17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[123:10.94]Oh, I made it.
[123:11.38]I made it.
[123:11.62]He's fine.
[123:28.70]Alright, what did we get?
[123:29.34]We got a magic banana, a fire feather, and disk chips.
[123:35.44]It was quite meaningful.
[123:36.54]Let's go back home.
[123:41.72]Hell yeah.
[123:43.82]Are you telling me I'm gonna get to be able to make a phoenix and then combine it with a weird plant monster and make a plant phoenix?
[123:56.44]That was a good adventure.
[124:03.61]Alright, we're going to go with tablets again.
[124:09.03]What do we do now?
[124:09.89]Should I just make a phoenix?
[124:18.90]After you create a phoenix by combining, you get infinite more from music tracks.
[124:26.64]Oh, okay.
[124:30.80]Can phoenix be combined with stuff?
[124:34.81]Can I make like a cosmic phoenix?
[124:45.83]Holy shit.
[124:46.45]Phoenix can't be combined, but I can pull a phoenix.
[124:53.51]Oh, so I can pull a different kind of phoenix.
[124:59.33]Phoenix is only phoenix or phoenix plus phoenix.
[125:03.90]Save the game, I will
[125:14.92]There's only three Phoenix types.
[125:16.44]Okay.
[125:17.19]Let's go make one.
[125:19.33]Okay.
[125:29.06]So let's freeze you.
[125:39.36]So now, what do I do here?
[125:42.01]Can I do this wrong?
[125:54.84]I can do this wrong?
[125:55.90]Oh god.
[125:57.40]I hope I get it right, whatever it is.
[126:04.60]Saved, I did.
[126:05.40]Get two monsters from the market.
[126:06.84]Combine two monsters and just use the feather.
[126:09.32]This is impossible to fuck it up.
[126:10.46]Let's combine two.
[126:12.44]Alright, who are we going to sacrifice here?
[126:23.60]Alright, who are we sacrificing?
[126:27.90]Xbox Series X and, um, Doodle?
[126:36.46]Atman?
[126:39.09]Does it matter?
[126:41.99]Stats are still transferred, so a high int monster will give good- oh, okay.
[126:47.27]Should I do Calamity?
[126:48.13]Should we just say fuck it and let's go?
[126:54.83]Bug Batman has high stats.
[126:59.66]Alright, I need a lore master to tell me this.
[127:02.72]If any combination with the feather gets a phoenix, if I combine Bug Batman and Cosmic Calamity and the feather, is the phoenix going to have really crazy base stats?
[127:14.59]I need a lore master to help me here.
[127:20.63]Dude, combination is such a fucked up math problem.
[127:23.15]I can't explain it in chat, dude.
[127:24.65]Okay.
[127:29.63]Stats will not be transferred for Phoenix.
[127:31.55]It's a unique summon.
[127:33.15]Okay.
[127:35.65]Combining is extraordinarily complicated.
[127:38.05]Alright, alright.
[127:39.53]So it just doesn't matter.
[127:43.54]So we're just gonna do two people that we don't really care about.
[127:45.96]I care about Wellington.
[127:47.44]I don't care about the Xbox Series X. Who cares?
[127:53.78]And a noodle, I don't really care either.
[127:58.55]Wellington and Bonnie, I think, could be used pretty well.
[128:06.71]Secret item.
[128:09.63]Where is it?
[128:11.40]There it is.
[128:12.10]Let's go.
[128:13.88]Let's do it.
[128:17.04]This one's all up to you, Phoenix.
[128:20.32]Yeah.
[128:20.62]Yeah.
[128:25.45]Phoenix sucks at power, has insane int, and the rest is average.
[128:30.09]You'll need to air entry for the int move again, but it only has one non-int move it can learn.
[128:34.39]Should I do facecam for this one?
[128:39.82]Alright.
[128:58.13]Whoa!
[129:00.48]170 base health, 190 int.
[129:03.82]Oh my god!
[129:09.80]Phoenix.
[129:10.18]It's the one we saw at the volcano.
[129:14.34]Well, take good care of it.
[129:16.54]You have to give it a name.
[129:19.84]A phoenix familiar.
[129:23.62]Red Wizard has got Phoenix familiar.
[129:27.59]Blue Wizard is about to die.
[129:30.15]Red Wizard needs food battery.
[129:32.97]Oh, it's definitely familiar.
[129:35.35]Let me call it familiar.
[129:54.24]They spell familiar.
[129:56.41]That's lame.
[129:58.09]Familiar.
[130:03.59]Am it Phoenix Wright?
[130:05.35]No.
[130:16.42]Long chicken.
[130:19.18]That is a boring one.
[130:20.40]Alright, fine.
[130:21.20]Yeah, it's boring.
[130:22.74]Familiar.
[130:23.70]That's fucking boring.
[130:29.40]Ah, BKLC?
[130:31.37]BKLC.
[130:32.39]Burger King Long Chicken.
[130:52.07]Now it's name is BKLC.
[130:57.33]Shit, it should have been Spicy BKLC.
[130:59.42]Oh well.
[131:04.20]Alright, cool.
[131:05.00]Wow.
[131:06.42]I have a phoenix.
[131:14.45]This is cool.
[131:15.19]Alright, so I need to make... Um...
[131:19.86]Excuse me.
[131:20.58]Hello, Loremaster of Monster Rancher 2 in the chat, please.
[131:26.03]Phoenix.
[131:26.89]All the monsters have different times where they peak.
[131:30.97]What does the phoenixes look like?
[131:33.01]Is it early?
[131:33.67]Is it late?
[131:34.77]Because I want to train this one correct.
[131:42.15]The Britney Spears toxic monster.
[131:45.08]I can look it up.
[131:45.56]Oh, yeah.
[131:45.76]I can just look it up myself.
[131:46.78]Right.
[131:48.16]Alright.
[131:49.24]Game stuff.
[131:50.44]Game guides.
[131:51.00]Okay.
[131:54.49]Monster Rancher 2.
[131:56.99]Looking for monster battle specials.
[131:58.97]Monster data.
[131:59.65]Here we go.
[132:02.01]Monster breed.
[132:02.73]Phoenix.
[132:05.95]Phoenix.
[132:09.98]Okay.
[132:10.40]Okay.
[132:13.72]Okay, stats.
[132:14.60]Stat gains.
[132:15.74]So it looks like it gains crazy intelligence.
[132:18.72]But everything else is pretty bad.
[132:19.76]Okay.
[132:25.90]You can use like an ice bird?
[132:27.94]What?
[132:30.95]Alright, there's an ice bird and there's like a dark bird.
[132:36.31]How do I get these?
[132:42.28]Spoilers.
[132:43.56]I wouldn't mean spoilers.
[132:48.86]The lifespan is only 350 weeks.
[132:57.93]If you want to train him well, you're going to need like $15,000 a year.
[133:02.31]Okay.
[133:05.25]So we're doing heavy intelligence.
[133:08.13]And what's a heavy intelligence skill?
[133:10.65]Like build it like the wall?
[133:17.93]Okay, let's take a look.
[133:20.59]I'm very curious.
[133:21.19]Let's freeze you for a second.
[133:24.36]Can I unlock a different phoenix now?
[133:27.98]One build Andy.
[133:30.54]Let me freeze him.
[133:41.41]It's painful.
[133:45.59]Okay, shrine.
[133:50.37]This stone.
[133:51.09]Alright.
[133:53.04]What am I looking for?
[133:53.82]Toxic by Britney Spears.
[133:59.48]Can I actually do this yet?
[134:02.88]No.
[134:04.42]It's a rare monster.
[134:05.20]Okay.
[134:15.05]Look up.
[134:17.81]White snake?
[134:25.35]This one?
[134:25.65]This one's rare.
[134:35.54]Oh, it's the band.
[134:36.36]Okay.
[134:37.42]Alright, what am I looking for?
[134:51.69]Do Highway to Hell.
[134:53.63]I will.
[134:55.15]Snakebite.
[135:01.60]Where's Snakebite?
[135:05.12]Oh, okay.
[135:07.74]Let's go.
[135:08.38]I want another one.
[135:19.56]Dude, this, okay.
[135:21.16]Alright, alright, alright.
[135:22.36]Look at this.
[135:23.22]Look at this thing.
[135:25.86]This is a unique monster.
[135:27.88]No way.
[135:35.33]229?
[135:39.63]What's the difference?
[135:42.45]Oh, wait.
[135:42.75]There's probably a difference, though.
[135:47.55]So there's a Phoenix and then Cinderbird.
[136:00.25]Okay.
[136:00.51]Let me check.
[136:02.87]Stat gains are C-E-A-C-C-C.
[136:08.10]I think it's the same as the Phoenix.
[136:13.50]What's the difference though?
[136:14.78]Besides the base stats.
[136:18.07]Yeah.
[136:18.47]Same exact stat gains.
[136:20.81]That's right.
[136:21.76]14 movement speed.
[136:23.50]Same exact thing.
[136:24.22]Base nature 90.
[136:25.48]Base nature 90.
[136:30.34]Cinderbird is enemy only and it's only available in this version.
[136:34.92]It has 20 more weeks of lifespan.
[136:36.41]Is that it?
[136:37.17]It's just a better Phoenix.
[136:37.93]That's the only difference?
[136:39.57]It's just a better one.
[136:41.49]Okay.
[136:44.99]It gets extra tech.
[136:47.87]Alright.
[136:50.25]Very cool.
[136:50.97]Alright, we're definitely using this one.
[137:12.17]Burnt BKLC.
[137:18.02]I had to use a space.
[137:19.04]I don't think I can.
[137:19.63]I don't think there is a space.
[137:30.71]If the phoenix is on fire, this one's like cinder.
[137:32.93]This one's kind of like burnt out.
[137:34.05]Smolder.
[137:39.51]Smolder.
[137:41.59]Smolder.
[137:48.37]Hmm.
[137:50.45]Schmolder?
[137:50.93]Uh, no, I'm not gonna name this character Burnt Fucker, okay?
[137:57.79]You do that in your game.
[138:04.31]Schmoke?
[138:06.27]No.
[138:08.77]Charcoal.
[138:11.49]Brickette.
[138:17.85]Brickette Alright Smulderloin?
[138:29.94]I like briquette How do you spell this?
[138:54.43]Brickette BK.
[138:57.38]How about BK Brickette?
[139:08.10]Somebody just called me a knob.
[139:12.58]I'm gonna keep Brickette.
[139:14.97]That's not iconic like Beanbag Sonic.
[139:25.53]I like BK for Kett.
[139:29.01]Smolder.
[139:29.75]No, the name doesn't matter.
[139:31.10]I make garbage names anyways.
[139:37.56]Kett is with an E. How about Brickett?
[140:00.18]Brisket.
[140:05.73]Alright, I gotta pick one.
[140:09.93]Brisket.
[140:11.51]Oh, now I got it.
[140:13.73]Brisket.
[140:22.98]Brisket.
[140:24.64]Like that?
[140:25.24]Like that?
[140:35.42]Did you get rid of the E?
[140:36.02]Get rid of the U. Brisket.
[140:38.64]There you go.
[140:45.59]Brisket.
[140:46.61]Done.
[140:48.29]It's with a Q. Seriously, I gotta fucking move on.
[140:59.86]There it is.
[141:00.82]Brisket.
[141:01.00]Brisket.
[141:08.60]Done.
[141:13.10]Frisket.
[141:13.74]Got it.
[141:14.00]Alright, now let's just look for some more.
[141:16.08]Why not?
[141:19.23]What if I combine... You can't combine phoenixes, right?
[141:23.95]Let me look up a few more.
[141:24.71]Because there's other monsters to get.
[141:26.93]You can combine two phoenixes.
[141:38.17]Alright, let me look up a couple songs that I want to look up.
[141:40.03]We did SpongeBob, I can't get SpongeBob.
[141:47.29]Jimmy Neutron?
[141:52.48]Nothing here.
[142:03.82]Oh, Beanbag Sonic.
[142:05.36]That's right.
[142:06.10]We could get Beanbag Sonic.
[142:07.84]Although... Hmm.
[142:20.66]Come on.
[142:25.50]Okay.
[142:30.68]Hip to be square.
[142:34.87]I like it.
[142:35.51]Wait, what?
[142:36.23]Where is it?
[142:36.71]What?
[142:36.91]I want to picture this.
[143:03.10]How about just Huey Lewis and the News, Huey Lewis and the News?
[143:05.26]Too rare.
[143:15.78]Four?
[143:17.43]Wait, what do you mean four?
[143:24.09]Do a random one?
[143:24.89]Random.
[143:27.21]Nova the Album.
[143:29.93]Okay, well Nova the Album.
[143:41.68]Ooh.
[143:44.42]Suazo.
[143:44.84]Okay, what's this little guy?
[143:51.28]That's not bad.
[143:52.62]But I don't want you.
[144:02.07]How about, like, DuckTales?
[144:04.31]DuckTales theme, metal version.
[144:09.71]Maybe it's a duck.
[144:20.60]I'm not doing another wall, sorry.
[144:28.80]And those stats are dog shit, so no, not happening.
[144:35.48]Meatloaf.
[144:37.58]Oh shit, alright.
[144:38.46]How about Meatloaf?
[144:40.56]How about Bat Out of Hell 2?
[144:48.41]Back into hell.
[145:03.76]Uh, we already have one of these.
[145:08.27]Wasn't too big of a fan.
[145:14.89]Stats are actually kind of good.
[145:15.73]157, 157.
[145:18.01]I might actually hold on to this one.
[145:38.37]Who's purple in the Batman universe?
[145:49.50]Joker?
[145:50.14]Nah.
[145:55.23]But I'm only gonna use this for a combination, I think.
[145:57.19]Whatever, who cares?
[145:58.11]Lowercase, doesn't matter.
[146:00.35]It's Joker.
[146:01.29]Goodbye.
[146:08.50]I don't want to run out of space either, though.
[146:09.82]Alright.
[146:10.62]What else do you want?
[146:12.06]The monsters before we take the Cinderbird.
[146:17.20]Okay.
[146:20.48]What do we got?
[146:30.35]You have 20 freezing slots.
[146:31.51]Okay.
[146:34.27]Agnum style.
[146:34.83]I don't think that would be on here.
[146:38.69]Find out though.
[146:40.17]It is on here.
[146:43.49]Which version?
[146:46.77]Which version?
[146:47.39]No, not that one.
[146:52.61]This one.
[146:52.99]Rare.
[147:09.81]Are they the other one?
[147:16.15]Am I spelling it wrong?
[147:17.99]Wait, what's happening?
[147:23.62]Wait, what am I doing?
[147:30.62]Okay.
[147:32.28]Here we go.
[147:34.06]This one works.
[147:45.93]Ooh.
[147:46.21]One of the dogs.
[147:51.07]Cool looking.
[147:53.19]I like the speed.
[147:55.91]I don't like anything else.
[148:08.15]Sandstorm.
[148:11.29]Imagine dragons.
[148:17.24]Not here.
[148:20.99]Darude?
[148:25.29]No, that, okay, I'm an idiot.
[148:29.13]Darude is the artist.
[148:32.47]Sandstorm with the remixes, or let's just do regular Sandstorm.
[148:38.05]Do rare.
[148:43.91]Try the remix.
[148:57.01]Um, okay.
[148:57.81]Definitely this.
[148:58.29]Yeah, this one.

[149:03.28]Can I just do... Alright, what's the one that's... It was the... What's that one called?
[149:28.32]This one.
[149:30.26]Not Seinfeld.
[149:32.98]Seinfeld.
[149:33.86]Yeah, it's called Tribute.
[149:38.40]Alright, where is it?
[149:41.20]Tenacious D. Is he Osborn?
[149:47.36]How about the Funk Hunters?
[149:52.21]I like that.
[149:54.61]Tenacious D, Tenacious D, Tenacious D.
[150:06.19]Where is it?
[150:06.51]It's not even here.
[150:09.35]Whatever, we're just going with the Funk Hunters.
[150:29.42]Ooh.
[150:31.49]The water...
[150:35.70]Monster?
[150:37.92]Strong looking, really.
[150:39.72]Looks dependable.
[150:45.01]So it's a dinosaur jelly?
[150:47.57]Water raptor?
[150:53.65]This is not bad.
[150:55.57]It's kind of all around not bad.
[151:00.22]It's a chaos.
[151:05.68]Um, that's cool, but I don't know if I want it.
[151:07.64]No, thanks.
[151:20.55]Uh, BBS is Death of a Bachelor by Panic!
[151:24.01]at the Disco.
[151:35.63]Here we go.
[151:37.45]Time to bring him back from beyond the grave.
[151:41.71]Beanbag Sonic.
[151:52.55]I love Beanbag Sonic.
[151:56.98]Speed is so- this- Beanbag Sonic is unironically very, very good.
[152:06.56]The base health and the base speed are very, very good.
[152:09.32]We're going to keep.
[152:28.03]Beanbag Sonic is back.
[152:38.59]You know what I really want to find?
[152:45.31]I want to find one of those apes.
[152:55.37]64 intelligence.
[153:01.64]Alright, alright.
[153:02.48]It's time to move on.
[153:05.98]I want to try to get one or two more decent ones.
[153:11.75]Do Babymetal's album?
[153:16.71]Babymetal?
[153:19.29]It's Babymetal.
[153:22.05]It's Babymetal?
[153:23.38]Babymetal.
[153:24.20]What is it?
[153:41.60]Jelly.
[153:41.90]Is it a jelly monster?
[153:44.04]Is it just jelly jelly?
[153:46.78]I think it is.
[153:47.18]How would you ever use this?
[153:52.58]What?
[153:52.82]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[153:54.44]These stats are awful.
[154:06.47]It's just a meme?
[154:07.21]Oh.
[154:07.67]Oh.
[154:16.55]Okay.
[154:18.53]What about hamster dance?
[154:22.01]Hamster dance.
[154:24.31]Did I spell it wrong?
[154:27.68]Hamster dance?
[154:28.90]Is it two words?
[154:31.08]Hamster dance.
[154:31.54]The hamsters.
[154:34.72]Rare.
[154:39.68]Jim Carrey?
[154:40.52]What do you mean Jim Carrey?
[154:49.41]Jim Carrey pecan pie?
[154:52.80]What is this?
[155:01.62]I've never heard of this.
[155:06.90]Oh, it's an ape!
[155:07.44]It's an ape!
[155:07.80]It's actually an ape.
[155:08.60]Alright, awesome.
[155:10.44]What kind of ape is this?
[155:16.89]Ooh, that's not bad.
[155:24.91]Yes, I want it.
[155:31.96]Okay, now, what if we combine the ape and... Oh, somebody else.
[155:41.41]Ape Ventura.
[155:44.75]Ape Ventura.
[155:49.93]I like Ape Ventura.
[156:06.77]That's a good one.
[156:11.11]Bind the ape with the monolith.
[156:19.88]Okay, let's freeze.
[156:21.52]Let's do a little bit of work here.
[156:24.60]Wait, I want to see what kind of monster this is.
[156:26.74]Wait, wait.
[156:27.06]I got to look at techniques and shit.
[156:28.10]Hold on.
[156:29.30]Data.
[156:29.52]Let's see.
[156:30.60]Okay.
[156:36.20]Likes jelly, doesn't like milk.
[156:39.76]Nature is bad natured.
[156:44.66]What's the... What kind of monster is this?
[156:49.07]Can I see the sub-monster?
[156:55.35]Is this an ape and something else?
[156:56.65]Or is it just ape?
[157:04.20]It's just ape.
[157:05.06]It's ape ape.
[157:07.98]Oh.
[157:08.76]Okay.
[157:10.00]So, if I combine this, I should look for something to do with it.
[157:13.74]It's just pure ape.
[157:15.08]Okay.
[157:17.58]Let's do some combining.
[157:18.24]Because I have disk chips, too.
[157:28.13]The ape does not have very many subspecies.
[157:29.99]Okay.
[157:31.99]Wait, let me save it.
[157:36.15]I've been doing a lot of stuff.
[157:37.15]Let's make sure I don't lose it.
[157:38.55]There we go.
[157:43.11]Very cool.

[157:55.90]Ape?
[157:56.60]Okay, we got Burger King, Long Chicken.

[158:03.14]Wellington.
[158:03.66]Ooh, what about Ape Wellington?
[158:09.30]That might be kind of good.
[158:14.72]Or... Ape, um... Ape Bonnie?

[158:24.67]Stop it.
[158:26.29]Why not?

[161:18.51]Ape and beanbag Sonic, no disk.
[161:23.97]Let's see what happens with this shit.
[161:25.18]I'm curious.
[161:28.04]We'll do a secret seasoning of Hare's Disk.
[161:32.92]Let's go.
[161:33.42]This combination sucks.
[161:48.26]And then we'll do... This is the only one we haven't really tried.
[161:53.75]And no seasoning.
[161:56.87]What the fuck?
[161:59.71]Alright, fuck it.
[162:00.65]Let's go.
[162:06.94]This is just for stats.
[162:10.06]Oh, okay.
[162:10.28]Alright, I'm ready.
[162:12.88]What are we pulling out?
[162:15.02]I think I have to pull the wall out.
[162:16.16]Yeah.
[162:19.66]We're doing Cosmic Calamity.
[162:23.51]We're so close.
[162:27.65]Brisket.
[162:29.49]Cosmic... Should we do Brisket?
[162:34.04]I need money though.
[162:35.12]No, not yet.
[162:35.76]I need money.
[162:47.15]I need to make another like $10,000 to $20,000. $20,000.
[162:51.46]Take out Bug Batman and let him die.
[162:53.30]Oh!
[162:55.63]That's right.
[162:56.33]Okay.
[162:57.17]Good idea.
[163:06.41]We're just gonna... We're gonna make money with Bug Batman until he dies.
[163:09.90]It's gonna be very sad.
[163:26.71]Everybody say goodbye.
[163:28.17]We're gonna get some money out of Bug Batman.
[163:33.30]Kind of a cool monster, but a really, really awful name.
[163:35.72]Not funny.
[163:36.76]Just sucked.
[163:39.54]But, I rest up.
[163:42.48]Next battle is, uh, we need to do C, right?
[163:45.34]3,000 bucks.
[163:49.25]Get some rest.
[163:56.98]How come I'm so cruel?
[163:58.56]Because when a monster dies, you unlock another breed.
[164:01.84]So somebody has to die.
[164:05.03]Uh... C, I would say, just to make sure I can make the money.
[164:15.25]Okay.
[164:30.23]There's a lot of fusions with this guy.
[164:33.79]Somebody has to die though.
[164:39.60]I got the Cinder Phoenix.
[164:41.76]That's going to be the S tier monster.
[164:54.97]Bug Batman style is doting.
[164:57.03]Yeah, because I spoiled the shit out of him.
[164:58.71]It's the first monster we used.
[165:12.82]I forgot it's not just one hit Andy.
[165:21.51]Are we trying to kill Bug Batman?
[165:23.05]We're not trying to kill Bug Batman.
[165:27.08]Bug Batman is about to farm money and hopefully get to somewhere around $30,000 to $40,000.
[165:32.62]He will put Bug Batman to rest.
[165:36.99]He will have done his job.
[165:41.13]Bug Batman seems to not be able to hit anything right at the moment.
[165:51.20]Oh, I'm in trouble here.
[166:00.15]I have to swing.
[166:00.85]Oh, I'm dead.
[166:08.39]I forgot how much this guy sucks.
[166:13.58]The other high level cup today gives 10k.
[166:17.36]It does?
[166:30.64]It's too late.
[166:34.42]I could just save.
[166:34.92]Yeah, I'd load the save.
[166:37.01]Yeah, no, fuck this.
[166:37.87]I give up.
[166:42.93]Yeah, forget that.
[166:59.97]It's 10 grand.
[167:01.15]There's no way I'm not doing it.
[167:02.22]The game kind of glitches out a little bit sometimes.
[167:12.06]Alright, let's go.
[167:18.36]Use the Monster Rancher 1 disk.
[167:19.88]The thing dies in one day.
[167:21.12]Is the one that's 10 grand?
[167:26.12]Is that 10 grand?
[167:29.38]What are you talking about?
[167:30.10]10 grand?
[167:31.06]Where do you see 10 grand?
[167:36.56]Isn't that 10 grand?
[167:42.74]None of these are 10 grand.
[167:47.29]It's the pure gold.
[167:49.61]Oh, this is pure silver.
[167:50.69]Oh, oh.
[168:06.57]Sell the gold I got you Let's feed you some soil Clean this up
[168:38.30]I need to do that Errantry and get this stupid move.
[168:50.67]Alright, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[168:52.83]Farm, farm, farm, farm, farm, farm.
[168:54.77]Instant kill.
[168:55.25]1, 2, 3.
[168:55.47]1, 2, 3.
[168:55.55]Dead.
[169:08.04]Very nice.
[169:14.86]Okay.
[169:15.54]Okay.
[169:16.16]Okay.
[169:18.55]Money.
[169:19.79]Get some money.
[169:20.45]Let's go.
[169:26.27]Watch out.
[169:26.59]He has Psychic Scream.
[169:36.33]Just use the speed function.
[169:37.43]Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[169:38.31]How do I do it?
[169:38.69]Uh, are you in fire?
[169:44.91]What is that?
[169:46.99]I think I can enable it from here.
[169:50.03]It's FF.
[169:50.77]What does FF stand for?
[169:51.97]Fast fighting?
[169:53.99]Fast forward.
[169:57.41]Oh, shit.
[169:57.85]You're right.
[169:58.15]Okay.
[170:11.14]Okay, this is like two... It's actually just times two speed.
[170:15.31]I thought... This hurts my head.
[170:29.37]Gold bar.
[170:33.22]Can the gold be used for anything else?
[170:36.86]Nice.
[170:37.16]Hmm.
[170:43.56]Sure, you can have polish.
[170:52.38]It makes Gold Suezo 1% less stressed.
[170:55.79]That's so stupid.
[170:56.63]Feels like it's in slow motion now.
[171:04.23]I'm not doing that again.
[171:04.95]It's fucking my brain up.
[171:15.19]So I need 17,000.
[171:16.53]By what date?
[171:26.39]Damn, how did you get this much money?
[171:27.48]I'm struggling to get money in the game.
[171:29.68]It actually takes a little while.
[171:31.64]Because your first couple of monsters are going to be kind of dumpy.
[171:35.40]And you're going to be spending a lot of money just keeping them alive.
[171:38.50]And trying to win shitty tournaments.
[171:40.64]But once you get the one person...
[171:43.44]that can reliably do C and B tournaments.
[171:47.67]And you can just kind of make money with that character.
[171:49.51]So, it takes a little while.
[171:54.25]The first six to ten hours of the game, actual in-game gameplay, I mean, sure, if you're like a veteran of the game and you know exactly what to do, but if you're just starting, it can be a little bit of a curve.
[172:05.54]Especially the training regimens, they're kind of confusing.
[172:09.84]Alright.
[172:11.98]When's the next battle?
[172:14.52]This one here.
[172:15.12]I'll do that one too.
[172:17.89]So let's do... I want to do an Errantry.
[172:22.83]Loremasters, when do I need $15,000 by?
[172:24.57]When do I have to have at least $15,000?
[172:33.48]By July 4th.
[172:36.58]So literally tomorrow.
[172:44.86]I need $17,000.
[172:45.56]It's August 8th.
[172:53.41]Sell something?
[173:02.75]Actually, do I really need to have $17,000?
[173:04.05]It's May 4th next year, not July.
[173:08.15]Okay.
[173:10.79]So, I have to wait a year.
[173:17.97]That's fine.
[173:19.91]So, in the meantime, I'm just- I'm gonna do an Errantry.
[173:25.56]I have to.
[173:25.98]I can't just wait for the dumb sale.
[173:27.48]This guy needs shit.
[173:32.52]So, if I do an Errantry now, I will be able to rest.
[173:37.26]Okay.
[173:38.30]Let's go.
[173:40.17]Doing an Errantry.
[173:52.84]What if I get the move I want?
[174:03.78]Your monster is higher than B rank and you can use any location you want.
[174:09.52]Oh, okay.
[174:14.69]You need to do Korea.
[174:18.01]Is this the place?
[174:23.35]I unlocked Mandy.
[174:31.51]What's the one to get the A?
[174:34.03]Korea?
[174:38.62]Seems that there is some chance to acquire a new technique here.
[174:46.18]I want Ray.
[174:46.80]Okay.
[174:47.82]Let's go for it.
[174:50.16]Yeah, let's fight a monster, too.
[174:51.48]One of these... We can definitely do at least a C. Ooh.
[174:56.61]Unicorn Beanbag Sonic?
[175:01.55]Carrie?
[175:07.11]Carrie.
[175:08.37]Who could I... Whoa!
[175:11.18]Magma Heart?
[175:12.00]Should we go for Terry?
[175:19.02]How about one-eyed?
[175:22.04]Let's go.
[175:35.01]Good.
[175:41.01]Yes.
[175:47.22]Nice.
[175:47.54]I got it.
[175:49.30]Alright, so I think I got Ray.
[175:55.09]This Crash Bandicoot music.
[175:56.79]It kind of is.
[176:01.31]Please turn an OST on and turn the in-game music off.
[176:10.04]We're dying.
[176:14.20]That's not unanimous.
[176:21.00]I think I'm not failing this.
[176:22.26]This is defense training.
[176:25.00]Alright.
[176:33.08]Alright.
[176:33.58]That's good.
[176:48.35]Sell beanbag Sonic's organs.
[176:53.04]Holy shit, he's... That looks... They alright?
[176:55.62]Please, no more clown music.
[177:09.96]I would like 200 health.
[177:15.88]I ran a sword.
[177:23.46]Can I get one of those?
[177:24.00]Shit.
[177:35.17]Come on, get up.
[177:47.02]Oh, I got saved by the- Nevermind.
[178:00.83]Get him.
[178:02.77]Get him and then fight Terry, whatever his name was.
[178:12.86]Yeah, that's it.
[178:13.50]I win.
[178:13.78]Now we get to fight that weird monster at the end.
[178:23.70]How was that?
[178:24.08]Like 20 defense?
[178:25.24]That was pretty significant.
[178:29.50]Goldy.
[178:32.66]I should win as long as he does an intelligence move and isn't an idiot and just bumps him a thousand times.
[178:37.13]Let's see.
[178:37.45]Oh, that was okay.
[178:40.43]Got him.
[178:49.60]I should have went for one of the B monsters or even one of the A ones probably.
[178:52.42]Great job.
[179:03.46]Easy battle to win against those guys.
[179:05.32]Let's go back.
[179:06.80]Um... Good job.
[179:11.82]What do you actually get for beating the monster at the end?
[179:14.74]Prize money?
[179:17.64]Oh, it just lets you get a... Okay, yeah, I remember.
[179:20.11]You get half back.
[179:28.43]Nice job.
[179:34.59]Pretty tired.
[179:35.11]Alright.
[179:37.37]What's that technique?
[179:46.64]Ray.
[179:47.10]Okay.
[179:50.36]This is horse.
[179:51.52]So it's hit B. These are all hit C. Okay.
[179:58.53]At least I'll be able to actually do shit.
[179:59.93]Withering is B on this as well.
[180:01.81]Which is guts removal.
[180:08.15]So that's really good.
[180:12.20]Whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[180:14.44]That's a huge amount of guts to use.
[180:17.87]35 guts?
[180:28.82]Your monster has 700 intelligence.
[180:30.48]He probably is smarter than any human that has ever existed.
[180:33.48]Yet you force it to fight instead of letting it learn a language and contribute to humanity.
[180:39.53]Yeah.
[180:43.83]Okay, that's fine.
[180:48.21]We need some anti-stress and rest.
[181:08.96]It also greatly reduces the enemy's guts.
[181:12.52]It's true.
[181:12.90]Maybe I should start with that.
[181:16.46]Or maybe that's like an oh shit button.
[181:17.64]If I miss the first one, just get in close and try to take their guts away so I can stall.
[181:20.90]Need to buy.
[181:35.76]It's powder.
[181:38.41]Oh, overweight.
[181:54.33]Keep game OST or play something else.
[181:56.13]Sorry, guys.
[181:58.35]That's democracy.
[182:04.97]Next battle is coming up here and it's three grand.
[182:09.88]And then I could try A again.
[182:11.36]Alright, we're going for this one.
[182:13.00]This one here, so we'll rest up.
[182:16.94]No.
[182:17.34]We need to do some training, right?
[182:19.97]Let's do another Errantry.
[182:20.85]Fuck it.
[182:21.13]Let's do another one.
[182:22.19]After this tournament, right?
[182:32.93]No, just double rest.
[182:33.99]Triple rest.
[182:43.96]I want to see the phoenix.
[182:46.46]I know everybody wants to see the phoenix.
[182:47.68]I do too.
[182:48.34]But I need to make enough money first.
[182:50.96]Because the phoenix is E rank.
[182:53.44]I got to get to like 20 plus thousand dollars.
[182:57.39]Once that happens, I can comfortably bring out the phoenix and train the absolute hell out of it.
[183:02.73]With buying all these products.
[183:07.99]Doing the air entries.
[183:12.22]Oop.
[183:14.84]Alright, nice.
[183:18.44]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[183:21.09]I can learn.
[183:21.63]Where's the other move?
[183:24.45]Cosmic Limit doesn't look very good these days.
[183:33.48]What?
[183:40.78]I'm going for A. I'm going for it.
[183:44.83]Save the game.
[183:45.57]In case I fuck up.
[183:57.98]He's got one last fight.
[184:02.84]He's got more than that.
[184:03.56]Probably another year.
[184:09.30]Let's go for it.
[184:11.90]Four grand.
[184:23.43]Alright.
[184:26.53]Something also to keep in mind, your no rest schedule you're doing does not work in the new game.
[184:33.73]It reduces lifespan quite a bit now.
[184:36.34]The new one is harder in RNG based because of magic bananas.
[184:41.96]Really?
[184:45.20]Really?
[184:45.52]Huh.
[184:50.71]Okay, well.
[184:58.45]Magic bananas in this economy?
[185:03.83]I got confidence we can land at least one hit here.
[185:09.75]60%, get it.
[185:10.57]I fucking am spamming!
[185:13.35]Spam it!
[185:13.86]Alright, now get in close and make the guaranteed hit.
[185:20.18]Get in close, get in close.
[185:21.02]It's a bigger hit.
[185:22.10]Get in close.
[185:26.68]Thank you.
[185:28.26]200 and what?
[185:30.22]Excuse me?
[185:30.66]I did that much damage?
[185:33.12]That was insane.
[185:42.97]Did I just do that?
[185:55.37]No rest method still does work.
[186:00.17]That's definitely the play, is you go for the coin flip.
[186:02.15]If you miss, you just get in close and you'll do some withering.
[186:04.65]That's a lot of power.
[186:07.89]This thing is awesome.
[186:09.02]What is this whale?
[186:10.30]It's a bipedal whale.
[186:11.66]Alright, get in close.
[186:22.22]And go.
[186:26.66]Hell yeah.
[186:27.20]Okay.
[186:27.54]Just actually stay in close and do it again.
[186:30.88]Should I go back?
[186:36.54]Stay in close.
[186:37.06]Get the guaranteed hit.
[186:44.10]No!
[186:44.24]66%!
[186:44.36]Give me a break!
[186:45.86]What the f-?
[186:48.50]Heck.
[186:49.08]66%.
[186:49.10]You know, you can't even land that.
[186:50.76]And you die.
[186:52.02]Oh!
[186:55.75]Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.
[186:56.73]Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[186:59.93]Holy shit, I actually pulled it off.
[187:01.49]No, I didn't.
[187:02.17]God damn it.
[187:02.75]He has got grit, too.
[187:03.67]Just push him.
[187:04.59]Just bump into him.
[187:05.27]Bump into him.
[187:06.39]How much does he... Bump him, bump him, bump him, bump him.
[187:10.58]Get in close, close, close, close, close.
[187:11.76]Bump him.
[187:15.62]Who wins?
[187:21.31]I won?
[187:22.01]Wait, what?
[187:25.66]Oh, because I had a high... Wait, I don't understand.
[187:29.22]Doesn't he have higher... Oh, because my health is lower.
[187:32.28]So my max health would... Okay, I'll take it.
[187:36.63]How come I censored myself?
[187:41.35]Because I promised my mother I would say less swear words.
[187:48.37]That was crazy.
[187:49.03]Am I going to win my first A cup?
[187:55.53]Find out.
[187:55.91]It's going to be tricky.
[188:01.93]I have to get a big crit here.
[188:11.75]Oh, that's it.
[188:26.66]I'm still in it.
[188:28.82]What?
[188:37.57]Injured?
[188:38.03]2,500?
[188:38.05]Reload the save.
[188:46.15]Uh...
[188:55.28]It's not serious, but I'll put it in the hospital for fast recovery.
[189:05.13]It's still in the hospital.
[189:08.79]Hope it'll come back soon.
[189:09.77]He's fine!
[189:15.09]Is that right?
[189:29.11]Check his hate.
[189:32.85]Hate?
[189:45.42]Loyalty went down?
[189:46.26]That's okay.
[189:49.82]It takes a ton of its life away.
[189:56.95]um wait I'm reloading safe okay uh we need a little bit of light training why not
[190:24.92]How about a little bit of dodging, whatever.
[190:27.22]Is it cheating?
[190:33.85]Alright, I promise I will not save Scum, the bird.
[190:56.29]Safe scumming is pretty much required for this game.
[190:59.80]Yeah, there's a lot of heavy RNG.
[191:03.02]Heavy RNG.
[191:06.54]Let's make some money.
[191:15.08]He dislikes tablets, Jeremiah.
[191:17.04]Yeah, well, here's the thing, though.
[191:18.92]According to the experts, it doesn't matter if they don't like tablets.
[191:23.82]It's still the best food to feed anyone, even if they don't like it.
[191:29.76]What I've been told.
[191:30.40]Hey, Pillboys, thanks for the 10.
[191:42.00]You know what I mean.
[191:44.04]Community stuff.
[191:48.87]What's your opinion on the... Hold on, what did you say?
[191:50.45]What's your opinion on the... What's your opinion on the socio-economic climate of Sugandhi's nuts?
[191:56.97]Um, well, I said the joke for you.
[192:04.17]I get to make it.
[192:04.87]You don't.
[192:09.45]Wait, you backed out?
[192:11.63]He forfeited.
[192:12.35]That's how you know I'm not supposed to be here.
[192:27.13]You couldn't have put less effort into that.
[192:45.37]After this, we're going to try, we're going to do another air entry.
[192:48.51]We'll get double beam because that's like the culmination of this whole thing.
[192:53.11]Double beam, try to just RNG ourselves through A rank and then either let him die or put them on ice.
[193:01.91]Alright.
[193:18.20]It's the biggest crit we've done so far.
[193:19.44]517.
[193:19.46]All I'm doing now is I'm trying to go for, you know, long distance home run records.
[193:29.81]I want to hit like a 600 foot home run.
[193:42.47]Slow down so we can gamble.
[193:44.03]I don't think gambling right now is a good idea.
[193:47.17]Considering I'm almost guaranteed to win every single B rank match.
[193:59.10]What's this item?
[194:02.56]Manseltan?
[194:09.83]What is that?
[194:14.10]Nice.
[194:17.58]Wow.
[194:18.14]Okay.
[194:19.60]Alright, you're almost ready to actually get us to S. Get that double beam.
[194:26.31]You want polish?
[194:28.71]Sure.
[194:29.37]You deserve it.
[194:39.44]Life go up, fame go down.
[194:40.88]Yeah, it's all good.
[194:46.26]Alright.
[194:47.34]We're looking for... This is the one right here.
[194:49.09]This is the official cup.
[194:51.93]Can I get through this?
[194:53.43]Heavy... Okay.
[195:03.55]If you go to the Heavy Errantry before August and you succeed with no injury...
[195:10.35]You'll be able to unlock Centaur.
[195:13.21]If you'd rather that than double beam.
[195:14.83]Hmm.
[195:21.04]Well, August is already over.
[195:28.80]I don't know.
[195:29.20]Let's go for double beam.
[195:36.34]Cosmic's gonna die soon anyways.
[195:37.70]Yeah, but I kind of want to see a huge number.
[195:42.90]True chads go straight for S rank.
[195:47.78]I'm going to try.
[195:53.10]Rest up before the... Let's try it again.
[195:55.39]I have to at least get to S. Look at your view count. 13,703.
[196:13.36]What about it?
[196:20.80]Big number.
[196:25.26]He didn't get the joke.
[196:28.98]Oh, I don't get the joke.
[196:29.96]I don't understand.
[196:31.72]Who cares?
[196:32.22]I don't care.
[196:37.53]I thought I was supposed to get something.
[196:39.81]What am I missing?
[196:45.89]Alright, come on.
[196:47.11]We can just luck Andy these people.
[196:50.01]Save the game.
[196:50.47]Official A rank.
[196:53.85]Get in there.
[196:54.27]Feed some items and shit so you're happier.
[196:58.51]Stress banana.
[197:00.64]Whatever this is.
[197:02.34]You wanted to see a big number.
[197:05.30]Oh.
[197:05.46]That was not like a joke.
[197:06.82]That was like nice.
[197:12.76]I can't believe there are this many people here.
[197:15.64]having a good time I love this game I think it's fun I think it's worth buying thanks for watching hi everybody alright it's time to save sounds good okay battle time
[197:40.11]If I got lucky once, I can get lucky twice.
[197:42.11]And if I can get lucky twice, I can get lucky five times.
[197:45.02]If I can get lucky five times, then I just have to hope I place.
[197:48.26]Come on.
[197:53.64]I have that new move, so I didn't have that last time I tried to do the official cup.
[198:00.05]The only one I'm actually afraid of is the one that... is that go trick.
[198:06.45]Let's go.
[198:13.63]This is it.
[198:16.03]I land the first hit.
[198:18.15]They're dead.
[198:21.93]You got to hit, go before me.
[198:23.32]Not fair.
[198:25.44]Bingo.
[198:27.64]Just have to do that a few more times.
[198:29.22]Finally get to S rank.
[198:43.21]Although this did happen last time.
[198:45.39]The best part about this though is that dragon is not here anymore.
[198:50.75]I think the dragon got promoted to S rank.
[198:54.73]They're not here.
[198:55.13]They were here the last two times.
[198:57.37]This is a big tournament.
[199:10.18]All the major tournaments are 8.
[199:15.07]Alright, lamb sweet.
[199:16.71]This person beat the shit out of us last time.
[199:22.65]All about, it's the speed.
[199:24.05]It's just the fact that I have a plan and I think I'm just going to go forward.
[199:29.13]Was it 30%?
[199:29.83]I have to go for it.
[199:32.71]It's going to be a shit percentage, but I have to do it.
[199:36.35]I'm fucked.
[199:42.25]Dodge it.
[199:46.18]I got grit though, I got grit, I got grit.
[199:48.90]I have to just land one, just crit for 500 right now.
[199:52.50]CRIT!
[199:56.92]Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge it!
[200:01.86]I need 24.
[200:04.50]24!
[200:04.58]Kill him!
[200:05.52]Back, back, back, back, dodge!
[200:07.54]Whatever.
[200:07.84]Alright, don't be fucking hurt again.
[200:11.77]That was a crit and it's probably gonna be hurt again.
[200:19.70]Oh, come on.
[200:20.92]Why?
[200:21.42]What?
[200:23.82]What?
[200:24.14]Yeah.
[200:52.78]He's elderly, dude.
[200:53.88]I didn't bring out Phoenix.
[201:32.69]Wait.
[201:47.88]This is pure silver.
[201:49.66]Wait, what happened?
[201:52.96]Oh, yeah.
[201:53.56]Okay, let's get it.
[201:55.10]4,000 gold and pure silver.
[202:14.67]Let him rest?
[202:15.63]I just gave him nuts oil.
[202:18.82]Nuts oil is essentially sleep in a bottle.
[202:21.36]That's what it does.
[202:24.78]That's why during that training regimen I'm able to give nuts oil and they don't have to sleep.
[202:30.29]What was that like weird glitch?
[202:32.77]That's weird.
[202:40.96]Is this guy going to get his revenge on me?
[202:42.99]I've one-hit killed this guy a thousand times.
[202:45.33]Okay.
[203:02.43]Very nice.
[203:06.21]Oh, Duelist.
[203:07.39]Oh, no.
[203:10.03]That's a good name.
[203:10.55]I like that name.
[203:12.33]Duelist.
[203:27.21]See, I've been doing... They're all getting hurt, probably.
[203:32.20]Also, You Laugh, You Lose is going to be on Tuesday of this coming week.
[203:38.70]I think that might be the next stream.
[203:42.86]I've got a lot of stuff I have to do this next few, like, three or four days.
[203:48.63]I wonder if I can sneak a stream in on Friday.
[203:53.75]But, we're gonna probably, it's not there right now, but we're probably gonna set up a thing where you guys can recommend You Laugh, You Lose videos.
[204:06.32]Are you guys seeing that?
[204:07.64]Why is that happening?
[204:08.80]You guys saw that, right?
[204:14.73]The screen is flickering.
[204:16.41]Is that happening to you guys or is it just on my end?
[204:18.43]That's weird.
[204:21.55]It's not happening?
[204:22.09]Okay.
[204:27.71]So in the Discord, just keep an eye over the next couple days.
[204:31.57]There'll be probably either a channel or something, or we'll set up a thing to make it so you can recommend some videos to watch.
[204:41.96]That's also the baby sensory stream.
[204:43.48]I have no idea what I'm talking about.
[204:46.12]I'm going to open up a notepad.
[204:48.40]I'm going to watch baby sensory videos, and I'm going to, in real time, describe to you how I feel.
[204:55.18]I'm going to lose.
[205:00.15]This guy did the same thing last time.
[205:09.32]Come here!
[205:22.59]God.
[205:23.11]Call it back.
[205:26.12]Just do it.
[205:26.84]Go forward.
[205:27.50]I don't know which way this guy's trying to go.
[205:28.90]Oh my god, dude.
[205:30.50]Really?
[205:48.95]He's 3-0.
[205:49.47]I didn't even win the tournament.
[205:51.22]What?
[205:52.08]This guy's getting old.
[205:53.14]It's over.
[206:05.93]He's old.
[206:06.91]I'll take the 2-3.
[206:07.57]That's fine.
[206:08.29]He's old.
[206:17.99]Okay.
[206:21.12]That's fine.
[206:21.70]You did a good job.
[206:22.45]You made us like 50 grand over the course of the last year and a half.
[206:29.47]Three year old birthday.
[206:44.20]Get strong and even much stronger.
[206:51.25]It sounds like a math problem written out as a sentence.
[206:54.33]Here's your cake.
[207:16.30]Alright.
[207:17.26]It's time to put him on ice.
[207:18.16]We got to A rank.
[207:20.52]Doesn't look well these days.
[207:21.71]I guess we have to consider his retirement.
[207:24.93]Who is it?
[207:29.65]Look at this.
[207:33.96]Ooh.
[207:34.30]Let's load up.
[207:36.48]This is perfect.
[207:39.40]I'm going to load up a shitload because we're going to do the no rest regimen.
[207:46.54]This is perfect.
[207:49.95]I'm going to buy like 10 of each.
[207:51.75]What can I sell?
[208:05.50]What is this?
[208:05.96]Medicine from the Far East.
[208:08.48]Life and skill will increase.
[208:10.11]However, speed will decrease.
[208:13.73]Huh?
[208:21.81]I have too many of these chips.
[208:24.89]I'm getting rid of one.
[208:27.19]Is that stupid?
[208:32.01]Alright, just get rid of this stuff.
[208:40.31]Sell them?
[208:40.83]I need at least 80k for the no-rest regimen.
[208:45.05]Well...
[208:52.35]You can feed these to the monster?
[208:57.63]Sell the chips.
[208:58.13]They're just not that useful.
[208:59.13]Should I really just sell them all?
[209:05.69]Are they not that useful?
[209:10.15]No, rest is $15,000 a year.
[209:13.67]They influence the breeding.
[209:14.59]That's it.
[209:15.43]Chips are just money.
[209:17.23]I sell them.
[209:17.95]They could be useful.
[209:18.59]Eh, we'll just get rid of them.
[209:19.43]I'm not going to use them.
[209:21.86]I'd rather buy the useful stuff to do the training regimen.
[209:28.95]They're all on sale.
[209:29.59]Should I get rid of the banana too?
[209:38.97]They just favor the breeding outcome, just relating to the species.
[209:46.38]Okay.
[209:53.86]Still has a decent bit of life left.
[209:55.06]Go get Soundwave.
[209:55.96]It'll carry you to S rank since you're into so high.
[209:58.50]I'll keep the banana.
[210:11.51]Um... I have six of each.
[210:23.47]I'm at my max unless I get rid of these.
[210:26.97]15k per year and you can sub the monster out during the months with the gold and silver to get 20,000-ish per year.
[210:33.99]Okay.
[210:36.85]You can see a beard on his face?
[210:38.31]You can?
[210:38.75]Let me see.
[210:40.19]No, you can't.
[210:43.75]He has a beard?
[210:44.37]Let me see.
[210:55.81]Oh, whatever.
[210:56.17]Put him on ice.
[211:09.55]It's time.
[211:12.69]It's time.
[211:13.43]You did a great job.
[211:14.25]You made us a lot of money.
[211:15.09]We're bringing out Phoenix.
[211:24.37]Phoenix is insane.
[211:27.33]Where are you?
[211:27.69]Look at these base stats, they're ridiculous.
[211:32.32]Let's go.
[211:48.16]I don't even know what the moves are, but I'm really excited.
[211:55.34]So everything is the same except for intelligence.
[212:00.76]Intelligence is monster gains on this guy.
[212:11.14]What stat is the least for the Phoenix?
[212:14.45]Let's find out.
[212:18.19]So there's literally no reason to ever do power.
[212:23.37]Power is worthless.
[212:27.41]stat gains are e which is awful so intelligence and everything else and don't ever do power so just everything on intelligence and I'm assuming probably speed what should I do let me see int and speed probably in speed and life
[212:56.78]Imp speed, life, and skill, I think is the order.
[213:02.20]Imp speed, life, skill.
[213:07.54]Probably in that order.
[213:12.75]Alright, let's begin the regimen.
[213:15.51]Regimen is as follows.
[213:20.75]Regimen is... I need to look up what Phoenix's peak performance is.
[213:29.78]Okay.
[213:31.05]So they spend... They're a late bloomer, apparently.
[213:45.39]They hit their prime pretty late, at their fifth and sixth stage of life.
[213:52.76]So they spend, actually, a pretty significant amount of time young.
[213:57.46]We're not going to see very many stat gains.
[214:01.88]Okay.
[214:06.10]Go for it.
[214:10.42]Alright.
[214:11.08]Training.
[214:11.84]You know what we're doing here.
[214:12.58]Grill.
[214:18.74]Meditate.
[214:22.50]You do Errantries during the early stages too.
[214:24.14]It's great for Errantry farming.
[214:28.41]We just go fucking do one right now?
[214:30.23]Literally, just let's go right now.
[214:32.35]Errantry immediately.
[214:33.15]Alright, where's the... I need to get a good skill.
[214:43.76]What should I look for here?
[214:49.08]Pappas?
[214:53.93]This dude was just born yesterday.
[214:55.23]Why are you making him do this?
[215:00.21]Skiller in.
[215:03.87]Save it.
[215:06.59]That's so cute.
[215:07.23]What a cute name.
[215:09.01]Alright, let's hurry up.
[215:14.37]Location, let's go to... I'm going to say probably Parapara.
[215:23.09]Or Torbal for the skill.
[215:34.94]Or should I do Pappas for the speed?
[215:41.86]I don't know.
[215:42.20]I'm so indecisive.
[215:46.74]Cosmic Andy literally lived three years out of eight.
[215:51.51]Well, he's not dead.
[215:52.19]He's still alive.
[215:52.83]I'm going Power Power.
[216:00.43]Just skip to that text, whatever it was.
[216:01.61]Sorry, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[216:03.15]Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[216:05.69]I'm just getting very distracted.
[216:06.59]I just don't want to fuck, you get one chance to do this.
[216:08.99]I don't want to fuck it up.
[216:10.60]Let's go.
[216:23.95]He's so cute.
[216:28.48]Don't ever go to Torbal.
[216:29.48]It's useless.
[216:30.40]Got it.
[216:41.04]Oh, I got it.
[216:43.28]Nice.
[216:43.58]First try.
[216:44.71]Hell yeah.
[217:00.89]Wait, you don't want to do it?
[217:03.83]Use your wings.
[217:04.43]Fucking idiot.
[217:11.82]I guess you're a baby, but... You can definitely do it.
[217:25.35]That's it.
[217:26.35]Nice.
[217:27.03]Good job.
[217:33.20]You know, Errantries might just be what I need to do.
[217:38.41]Because you get really, really small, less than four, less than three plus when they're babies.
[217:44.46]I'm going to end up with like plus 20 intelligence from this.
[217:48.92]If I got the money, might as well just do it.
[218:01.53]They take three weeks of life off of you.
[218:04.55]Oh, OK.
[218:06.09]These increases are huge, though.
[218:07.23]I'm already almost at 250 intelligence.
[218:14.91]You didn't fight the thing at the end?
[218:15.81]Nice job.
[218:21.36]Alright, time for rest.
[218:25.10]What did you get?
[218:34.88]Like cedar logs.
[218:37.51]Best nature.
[218:40.05]Oh, flame shot.
[218:41.39]Hell yeah.
[218:44.51]Force D, hit percent A. Force D, hit percent C. This costs a lot.
[218:56.52]Alright, we need to do stress relief and sleep.
[219:16.64]Get some rest.
[219:18.96]I am fairly certain that this character will be able to just blow immediately through D rank.
[219:23.41]250 intelligence already.
[219:49.51]Okay.
[219:51.32]What do we got?
[219:53.44]I think I'm just going to put him into the official cup.
[219:55.14]Just skip.
[219:56.60]Have him skip a couple grades at school.
[220:03.76]Training.
[220:04.12]I don't want to fuck this up though.
[220:07.08]So we probably should do speed.
[220:09.94]Speed and intelligence probably number one and number two.
[220:15.46]Or should I just dump into intelligence?
[220:23.49]If you get over 500 intelligence to go to Korea, you'll get the fire stream.
[220:26.55]Okay?
[220:31.66]Nice job.
[220:53.98]tablet time take your pills take your medicine alright it's a new month I'm going to do let's do oil
[221:23.26]And then do heavy training.
[221:27.74]Mint leaf.
[221:28.22]Tournament.
[221:36.97]Is there an intelligence and speed?
[221:38.19]There is.
[221:41.77]What's more important right now though?
[221:43.01]Focusing on intelligence or focusing on speed?
[221:54.72]I wonder.
[221:59.14]Just wait for the loyalty.
[221:59.98]Power is going to be irrelevant, so leap is probably pretty good for this.
[222:07.96]Just swap between them.
[222:08.75]We'll do speed.
[222:09.45]I'll just jump between them.
[222:24.33]Nice.
[222:25.73]Very nice.
[222:26.23]Okay.
[222:27.86]Now let's do... Intelligence?
[222:39.52]When's the battle?
[222:44.85]Okay.
[222:45.31]I can do Intelligence this time, and then...
[223:04.74]Should- Alright, should I even- Should I just say fuck it and just train the absolute hell out of this guy?
[223:22.65]Try to say guy and bird.
[223:27.17]And I ended up saying, like, pie.
[223:37.19]Okay, nuts oil.
[223:42.99]Heavy.
[223:44.17]Speed and intelligence.
[223:48.75]He'll die in a year.
[223:49.93]Oh, shit.
[223:53.28]I'm gonna go for it.
[223:54.44]Whatever.
[223:55.24]Let's go for it.
[224:04.12]I'm gonna beat the whole game in less than a year.
[224:34.74]Okay.
[224:37.67]Doesn't he just come back?
[224:39.45]If he's a phoenix?
[224:40.31]I don't know.
[224:44.89]I want health too.
[224:45.69]Alright, what the fuck did I just do?
[224:51.21]Okay, we're just doing intelligence.
[224:53.85]Study.
[225:10.59]Once we get into the prime... Oof.
[225:12.89]Has there been a BRB yet?
[225:13.87]No, not yet.
[225:14.37]I'm too addicted.
[225:18.43]I can't leave.
[225:18.97]Okay, now we do...
[225:37.72]Wait, I need to do... Oil, right?
[225:42.81]Yeah.
[225:43.79]What?
[225:43.97]I think so.
[225:45.71]Is this a BR?
[225:53.90]No, it is a fighting one versus one game.
[225:58.27]Get 300 skill and go to Med Bay.
[226:01.62]You can get a strong intelligence mood called... That's not in this game.
[226:05.18]I just read your message for no reason.
[226:12.20]Speed again.
[226:23.93]Excellent.
[226:29.00]Come on now.
[226:29.62]That was only plus three?
[226:41.63]I don't remember.
[226:42.11]Mid-leaf.
[226:45.83]Okay.
[226:55.60]I'm going to do intelligence just straight up.
[227:07.67]Put on facecam?
[227:08.60]Alright, you get your facecam.
[227:10.28]After I go to PRB.
[227:22.18]We'll do this one.
[227:22.89]I'll play, just to make sure I can do it, right?
[227:47.81]I'm gonna go with meditate.
[227:52.53]Freddy Dread coming in with 50 community subs.
[227:55.07]Holy shit, Freddy.
[227:56.67]What's up, Freddy?
[228:00.35]How's it going?
[228:03.03]Thanks for the million dollars or whatever that is.
[228:04.79]Plus one.
[228:06.39]What is that?
[228:12.98]Oh, thanks, dude.
[228:13.50]Good to see you.
[228:34.56]Okay.
[228:36.57]Alright.
[228:38.71]We got... This week we're gonna train.
[228:40.25]Then I'll rest and we'll do the tournament.
[228:43.33]That sounds good to me.
[228:46.67]Uh... Life, too, maybe?
[228:52.98]Sprinkle it in?
[228:56.21]Not yet.
[228:56.87]Maybe later.
[228:57.33]Speed.
[229:01.32]Brisket has not failed a single training.
[229:12.39]Not one.
[229:26.06]Best nature.
[229:28.72]I think this is the mo- I- I honestly really believe that before this dream turns off, we're gonna do an insane training regimen, and this bird will be able to just wipe the floor with everybody, and I'll be able to skip like eight- I'll be able to skip to A rank in like 45 minutes.
[229:43.83]Alright, let's rest.
[230:00.17]What CD made this?
[230:02.05]I had to unlock it by finding the feather in the volcano.
[230:06.59]And then... I forget what song actually was to get the cinder.
[230:13.25]Let's give it a go.
[230:15.63]Alright.
[230:32.00]After this tournament, I'll go PA, I promise.
[230:35.07]Thanks for reminding me to drink water.
[230:36.27]It's been like four hours.
[230:52.41]We can't lose.
[230:59.64]How do you compare?
[231:01.36]Because we did skip a whole rank.
[231:04.68]Pretty good, even though we skipped E. I'm very curious.
[231:09.64]What are your moves like?
[231:15.77]Oh, hell yeah.
[231:16.33]That was sick.
[231:20.31]Hang back.
[231:20.75]I have high speed.
[231:32.15]Alright.
[231:33.47]Dodged it.
[231:34.99]Exactly what you want to see.
[231:39.27]Dodged it.
[231:39.75]Alright.
[231:48.33]Okay.
[231:48.53]Not going to be super powerful yet.
[231:55.24]There it is.
[232:07.31]I know Millium has low HP.
[232:13.59]It's also skipping a rank too, yeah.
[232:18.19]I mean, if I do well here, that means the official tournament, I'll just do D. And just skip right to C. Perfect.
[232:30.76]Ooh.
[232:32.78]I think I'm just going to do power moves.
[232:36.81]Yeah.
[232:39.37]Get in there and just beak.
[232:44.49]Nice.
[232:48.07]Get in there again.
[232:50.81]Stop doing that.
[232:51.83]Stop!
[233:11.02]I'm not doing any moves.
[233:17.62]There it is.
[233:17.96]Alright.
[233:19.12]We are capable of doing D rank.
[233:28.82]That's huge.
[233:30.72]That means the first tournament I do, I should be able to skip right to C. And then we can focus on training.
[233:35.96]I don't have to win tournaments.
[233:50.83]Make a few bucks.
[234:00.94]Should get a little more than that.
[234:01.92]I skipped a whole rank.
[234:07.70]Ooh.
[234:11.10]I probably should do tournaments then.
[234:15.19]Maybe not the official ones.
[234:18.89]We'll do the non-official D tournaments.
[234:26.54]right this one's not official 2000. I'm gonna do that one again alright let's uh go pee right right okay okay perfect see you guys in like two or three minutes
[237:49.00]I have returned.
[237:49.66]Guess what I'm eating.
[238:02.09]What am I eating?
[238:07.74]Nope.
[238:09.92]Cliff bar, but what kind?
[238:11.86]Come on, we need to know.
[238:19.57]Blueberry crisp.
[238:21.09]Thank you!
[238:29.69]This is so good.
[238:31.11]It really is.
[238:37.74]I used to hate these things.
[238:42.92]I used to think I was chewing on tar.
[238:45.86]I hated these things.
[238:46.54]I thought they were terrible.
[238:48.83]I don't know if this is a new formula, or if this is Blueberry Crisp.
[238:52.81]The Crisp versions of these are new.
[238:55.19]But these are a million times better than I remember.
[239:00.86]This is fantastic.
[239:08.02]You promise to facecam?
[239:10.22]I will.
[239:19.43]Have you ever had a builder bar?
[239:20.43]No, I haven't.
[239:32.26]Is it sponsored?
[239:32.88]No, it's not.
[239:37.54]Have you ever had a builder bear?
[239:39.44]No.
[239:43.97]No, I don't like that you put a heart in it.
[239:45.41]It makes it like real and weird for me.
[239:47.27]Nope.
[239:59.66]It's, I don't know, it's weird.
[240:03.04]When you build a bear, don't at the very end, you put a heart inside and you like seal it up.
[240:07.66]I don't know, that's weird to me.
[240:09.14]I don't want it.
[240:09.92]I don't like it.
[240:18.00]I want this shit full of stuffing, that's it.
[240:19.26]I don't want to put like a, I don't want to do like a fucking seance.
[240:29.90]You whisper into the heart, and you can have it have a secret message.
[240:36.14]It's not Jerma, it's a plushie.
[240:37.42]I know what it is!
[240:38.34]They're in like every mall in America.
[240:42.90]This is so good.
[241:04.35]I mean, they look like they're high quality.
[241:10.41]I just don't want to, like, breathe a wish into a heart and seal it inside of the thing's body.
[241:14.26]Alright, let's go.
[241:27.19]It's not a voodoo doll.
[241:41.85]facecam you guys seriously are come on let's see what it looks like what do you think about that but we need a worst hair candidate right it's not enough
[242:19.66]It's like, okay, you know what's really funny about hair?
[242:23.60]I look like a mad scientist right now.
[242:26.65]I just made myself handsome.
[242:29.69]Do you see how fucking weird that is?
[242:32.53]Mad scientist, scary person.
[242:36.82]Handsome young man.
[242:37.98]Like, why?
[242:49.83]I got something on my mouth.
[242:51.63]Everyone was just freaked out.
[242:59.41]I thought I was going to do it in one bite.
[243:01.65]No, I would choke.
[243:07.72]I'm still young.
[243:09.16]You're young until you're 50.
[243:21.75]That I believe.
[243:26.05]You look like your name would be Maurice.
[243:30.80]Why?
[243:30.88]You look tall today, thanks.
[243:48.24]Alright, I'm sick of holding this.
[244:01.41]Okay.
[244:32.81]I forgot to talk.
[244:36.95]Alright, let's go!
[244:39.28]Buy some more items.
[245:29.88]Did I rest yet?
[245:32.46]Are you chewing a tire?
[245:33.70]Dude, it's a fucking Clif Bar.
[245:42.99]It takes ages to eat these.
[245:45.89]I didn't just bite into like a piece of deli turkey.
[246:07.56]I'm not kidding.
[246:08.46]I'm still going.
[246:09.10]Pfft.
[246:20.03]Pfft.
[246:39.87]Almost done.
[246:50.90]Yeah, I have plenty of teeth.
[246:54.24]I guarantee you can't eat a Clif Bar in like 30 seconds.
[246:58.43]You'll fucking choke.
[247:01.83]Yeah, I have more than six teeth.
[247:03.65]I promise.
[247:07.45]I don't like drinking on camera.
[247:09.15]This is a beer.
[247:26.88]Alright, let's go.
[247:32.50]Show me your teeth.
[247:42.98]Give me the controller while you're eating.
[247:43.96]I like wood.
[247:50.39]Okay, training begins now.
[247:55.44]It's going to be Errantry, isn't it?
[247:56.96]Come on.
[247:57.74]Come on, Gwyn.
[247:59.24]Come on, Gwyn.
[248:00.84]Errantry.
[248:04.08]Which one do I want to do?
[248:07.47]Which Errantry do I want to do?
[248:08.95]I'm just going to address this person because I think they've written this like 50 to 60 times in the last two hours.
[248:16.39]This game copied Among Us.
[248:19.13]I'm just going to say it because I know that it'll probably make you stop saying it.
[248:23.33]I've said it.
[248:23.99]There you go.
[248:26.81]Why is my facecam so dark?
[248:27.91]Because I... Okay, I was thinking about buying one of those ring lights.
[248:33.11]Then you'd see what I'd really look like.
[248:34.69]I don't want that.
[248:36.19]Why did you acknowledge it?
[248:36.95]I don't know.
[248:41.02]What... What errantry do I want to do?
[248:43.78]Hmm.
[248:56.95]skill one okay it's cheap let's go uh no you guys said torbo was awful speed or intelligence mandy go to mandy power in life though
[249:26.79]Awful.
[249:30.35]Papas.
[249:30.91]I'll do papas.
[249:34.93]No, let's go fucking intelligence.
[249:47.24]You get something called fire twister?
[249:48.54]Alright, we can skip this somehow, right?
[249:53.95]Okay.
[249:55.77]Okay.
[249:57.82]I know, I'm gonna start becoming Skipping Andy.
[250:06.21]Didn't get it there.
[250:06.79]It's alright, I get another chance.
[250:19.49]Nice!
[250:19.73]Give me that skill.
[250:27.00]Scald it?
[250:27.58]Why?
[250:27.82]Alright, didn't get one.
[250:33.63]Your remaining skills are Fire Twister from Papas and Fire Stream from Korea.
[250:38.37]You need 500 intelligence.
[250:39.59]Okay.
[250:40.27]Papas in Korea.
[250:56.80]Alright, we need to rest.
[251:00.78]Sleep.
[251:09.73]Just lost an S-ranked tourney by missing a 93% chance.
[251:13.09]Is this another air entry?
[251:18.60]Am I going to do back-to-back air entries?
[251:20.30]Oh, alright, this is good.
[251:27.70]I'm going to use the mint leaf right now, though.
[251:29.34]I'm going to do heavy technique.
[251:35.06]Oh, no.
[251:36.40]I did that wrong.
[251:37.27]Oops.
[251:39.41]Oh, well.
[251:50.69]I'll buy nut oil instead.
[251:58.13]Get rid of the junk.
[251:58.99]Disk chips.
[252:02.30]Burn them.
[252:04.76]Okay.
[252:05.36]I'll get another mint leaf.
[252:06.32]It's not what I want.
[252:10.44]This one right here.
[252:11.22]Okay, good.
[252:11.62]We're not peeping any horrors.
[252:17.20]No.
[252:23.35]Speed.
[252:23.71]Speed.
[252:26.39]Speed.
[252:39.67]Great, come on.
[252:40.55]I can't get more than that?
[252:47.83]I wonder when I become... When do I get into Prime?
[252:57.33]Probably not for a little while, right?
[252:58.49]Okay.
[253:09.54]I think I'm gonna do... Meditate?
[253:21.04]You're an Amazon Prime streamer?
[253:22.37]What are you talking about?
[253:40.62]Intelligence, just normally.
[253:51.19]Nuts oil.
[253:53.63]And then do meditate again.
[253:55.79]This time, get it right.
[253:56.45]Or you're going to piss me off.
[254:00.76]You pissed me off.
[254:05.38]You pissed me off.
[254:12.67]Which food do you want?
[254:16.01]Yeah, let's... Well, you have to have 17k for May.
[254:22.64]Oh, shit.
[254:23.10]Do we have to unfreeze the wall to make some money?
[254:28.76]What day is it?
[254:36.79]Okay.
[254:38.11]We have to bring the wall out to do this C-Rank.
[254:45.81]Because I need to have $17,000 to get to this.
[254:52.02]So I can train here.
[254:52.92]Did I do this already?
[255:01.26]I'm supposed to forget what I fed them.
[255:09.59]Alright, please get it right.
[255:21.40]Here we go.
[255:27.73]Good.
[255:28.45]Good.
[255:29.21]Good.
[255:30.21]Good.
[255:31.43]Good.
[255:31.71]Looks like the seed we saw has already germinated.
[255:40.81]Ooh.
[255:45.37]Very cool.
[255:47.75]Seems well.
[255:53.68]Okay, we're gonna go make some money.
[256:00.39]Only nine more years.
[256:01.69]Yeah, that's good.
[256:04.23]Okay, so we have to make this money.
[256:06.66]I guess I could... Yeah, I get the 3,000.
[256:09.40]I want some wiggle room.
[256:10.16]I don't want to be broke.
[256:26.46]Phoenix Prime can take four years.
[256:28.58]Holy shit.
[256:29.38]What?
[256:29.52]Let's go make some money.
[256:44.33]I actually might just have the wall just do this one and this one.
[256:53.57]Right?
[256:54.07]Like, who cares?
[257:04.51]If he dies, then I guess he's gonna die.
[257:13.71]You're doing a poll for this?
[257:14.95]This is C rank.
[257:19.87]Why do you put a facecam on if we can't even see you?
[257:37.79]There.
[257:57.18]You see me?
[257:57.46]We're good.
[258:13.12]Why would you ever vote against this?
[258:15.36]He's too old.
[258:34.70]He's too old!
[258:45.77]I actually lost.
[259:17.60]20, 21, 21.
[259:26.12]Saved.
[259:29.26]Right at the buzzer.
[259:35.45]He's just too old.
[259:36.09]He's just sloppy.
[259:44.29]Scammed.
[259:48.68]This actually, I'll probably do it in one hit.
[260:00.45]Oh, maybe another hit.
[260:04.55]Okay.
[260:09.03]How close is he to dying?
[260:09.85]I don't know.
[260:10.59]Probably pretty close.
[260:17.92]Well, to be fair, I am just farming money with this guy.
[260:20.68]If you're voting at your own risk here, you're betting at your own risk.
[260:25.12]I just want to make sure I have enough money where I'm not going to go broke so I can still train the bird.
[260:44.86]It is free money.
[260:50.22]You have 750K.
[260:52.12]750K what?
[261:05.80]Subscribers?
[261:07.54]That'd be weird.
[261:13.57]Oh, it's followers?
[261:15.57]That's cool.
[261:15.93]Do you think it'll ever get to a million?
[261:24.45]That's the one thing.
[261:25.57]So on YouTube, I've moved around too much.
[261:30.17]So I remember I was approaching like seven or 800,000 subs on Jerma nine, eight, five on YouTube.
[261:38.52]And I didn't get there.
[261:42.06]So I moved on to Twitch, started this channel getting to 750,000.
[261:49.62]The second channel has 700,000.
[261:52.38]I wonder if any of these platforms will have a million.
[261:57.94]I might get close.
[261:59.00]It depends on, I guess, how much longer I do this.
[262:02.18]Third account.
[262:05.78]Yeah, but I get to say, right?
[262:07.76]I get to say, well, you know, I have over 2.4 million followers across his platforms.
[262:17.59]No, more than that.
[262:18.51]If you include Twitter and shit.
[262:21.17]I've got over 2.5 million followers across all of my platforms.
[262:25.65]I can say that.
[262:28.94]Even though it's fucking horse shit.
[262:42.74]What happened to Cosmic Andy?
[262:45.08]Cosmic Andy is going to be alright.
[262:53.10]How about it, Cosmic Andy?
[262:55.21]One last A win.
[262:56.95]You can do it.
[263:15.16]Only four people.
[263:20.56]Alright, let's go.
[263:21.58]Time for Cosmogandy to pull it out.
[263:22.86]This is five more grand.
[263:25.95]One last one, Cosmogandy.
[263:29.19]It's not even his name.
[263:44.98]Let's go.
[263:49.30]This will be for five or six thousand.
[263:51.80]And I can solidify Cosmic Andy as an A rank, technically S ranked monster.
[264:01.55]All I gotta do is flip a few coins and win.
[264:12.24]Let's go, you motherfucker.
[264:17.84]740 intelligence.
[264:21.91]I'm going to pick my battle here.
[264:23.69]I'm not going to do anything right away.
[264:28.15]Build up the guts.
[264:28.77]34%.
[264:29.07]That's a big problem.
[264:40.08]And he drained me of my guts too.
[264:42.66]He's dead.
[264:52.37]This little shit has won so many times.
[264:55.11]It's so unfair.
[264:55.91]I always have to fight this stupid guy first.
[265:06.23]I can still make a few thousand dollars though.
[265:07.60]I just have to win.
[265:11.08]This character is ridiculous.
[265:12.44]This character is ridiculous.
[265:14.38]I just have to get a crit.
[265:15.60]Pray for a crit.
[265:23.82]Bounce away.
[265:24.60]Bounce back.
[265:36.98]Eat shit.
[265:37.66]I'm going to get money.
[265:40.48]I actually get money.
[265:43.14]I think I'll get at least a thousand bucks.
[265:44.32]He's got to win one more.
[265:53.73]Alright, Lamp Suite wins.
[265:56.35]I have to beat Kitty.
[265:59.28]Oh no, Arcalon.
[266:03.94]Alright, this is a must-win scenario right here.
[266:51.73]A few thousand.
[266:52.31]200 for third place?
[266:57.56]What?
[266:57.92]Okay, put him on ice.
[266:59.08]Get him out of here.
[267:06.36]What?
[267:16.87]Dude, you're fucking up my schedule.
[267:18.21]I have to pay for the stadium.
[267:19.51]Whatever it is.
[267:20.07]Where'd it happen?
[267:22.76]Oh, come on.
[267:23.60]I have to... It skipped the week that I need to build the stable.
[267:43.62]You know what?
[267:44.30]Go back to town.
[267:50.22]Just stay here.
[267:52.71]You tried.
[267:53.71]You're just too old.
[268:05.91]I got the money that I wanted from the last one.
[268:07.64]So we're good.
[268:12.94]Let's go, Prisket.
[268:25.68]Okay, we can do a little bit of a rest.
[268:31.04]How are you?
[268:31.46]Are you okay?
[268:35.08]A little bit of intelligence, huh?
[268:39.32]Is BrickHead tired?
[268:40.22]I thought birds were supposed to be smart.
[268:57.01]Birds are supposed to be intelligent.
[269:03.41]Here we go.
[269:06.56]Better provide the stable first than bread.
[269:09.64]If the stable is clean, Brisket can live comfortably.
[269:12.84]Besides, we cannot train a big monster with a small stable.
[269:15.74]$15,000 to rebuild the stable.
[269:22.70]Do it.
[269:24.86]Brisket will be very happy.
[269:30.46]Alright.
[269:32.04]Got it.
[269:38.88]Perfect.
[269:42.35]Now I can get huge monsters.
[269:50.29]Very cool.
[269:50.61]Got 4,300 bucks.
[269:59.97]Alright, so now we do nut oil.
[270:02.23]Heavy train.
[270:14.13]I can now get the big dog.
[270:15.69]Nice.
[270:15.93]Alright, meditate.
[270:23.25]Let's go.
[270:30.34]Series Eve award submissions close in two hours.
[270:34.14]That's right.
[270:35.10]Let's actually talk about that.
[270:37.84]If there is something that you want to nominate, now's the time to do it.
[270:43.96]And then in a couple of days, probably like two or three days over this weekend, I'd say by Sunday, I will put the poll
[270:54.11]in the Discord, I'll put it here, and I'll tweet about it.
[270:58.06]So, if it's something you want to nominate, this is the last opportunity to do it.
[271:02.02]Have I caught a shiny yet?
[271:04.76]Not the right game.
[271:14.02]Tablets.
[271:16.56]There are way too many submissions.
[271:19.50]Well, like all awards ceremonies,
[271:24.35]The nominations, not every single nominee is going to get in.
[271:27.25]It passes through a filter.
[271:30.61]And some stuff is going to be removed.
[271:32.99]It'll be narrowed down.
[271:34.77]So don't worry.
[271:35.29]It's not going to be... You don't have to vote between one in 40 submissions for the same category.
[271:42.94]Okay.
[271:51.43]Stress reduction.
[271:59.49]I'm going to do speed.
[272:13.02]That's good.
[272:13.60]1984.
[272:21.31]Not getting increases.
[272:22.59]Come on.
[272:22.95]Get into the prime of your life already.
[272:25.15]How old are you?
[272:31.11]Seven months.
[272:33.53]How long do they live?
[272:34.13]When can I expect to see Prime here?
[272:47.00]Five years as Prime.
[272:49.19]Three years.
[273:02.08]I want more speed.
[273:08.68]Tell people that when they check the spreadsheet to control F and make sure they're not submitting the same thing.
[273:12.32]Yeah, make sure, take, give it a good look.
[273:14.40]Make sure you're not quadruple submitting the same thing.
[273:36.20]intelligence.
[273:38.54]I'm not gonna do life until I can actually get good points for it.
[273:41.33]I hope the toucan is getting paid.
[273:48.51]Um, should I do the official tournament?
[274:08.29]Nah, we'll do this one.
[274:14.18]Remember, I skipped the rank, so I'm good to go.
[274:44.72]Good.
[274:46.70]330 intelligence already.
[274:47.60]Not even in my prime yet.
[274:49.75]I might get this guy to 800 intelligence or more.
[274:53.29]Alright, we'll do the tournament this week.
[275:00.20]Because I need to make a little bit of money and he'll get stats.
[275:17.18]You gonna do Mario Paint tonight?
[275:18.30]Intelligence again.
[275:30.17]You can probably get 802 stats, that'd be insane.
[275:44.67]Phoenix has the highest stat growth in intelligence, so it'll grow super fast.
[275:49.42]Like that.
[275:49.76]Nice job.
[275:57.20]Alright, let's kick some ass.
[275:57.90]We need to buy more shit.
[276:16.89]I don't want to blow all my money.
[276:23.26]Alright, that'll be a full week.
[276:26.90]Battle!
[276:33.38]You missed somebody who was majoring in bird law.
[276:36.74]I watch Always Sunny too.
[276:42.89]I was going to wink at you, but nah.
[276:46.63]How do we square up here?
[277:04.44]Really, really good.
[277:10.36]I even have pretty good power compared to this guy.
[277:18.43]Alright, hold off here.
[277:19.11]Alright, I'm going to farm some guts.
[277:30.13]Because I don't want to... Well, actually.
[277:36.58]Stay back.
[277:36.96]You can't do anything.
[277:37.50]Oh, no.
[277:37.86]Oh.
[277:38.12]Alright, you got to land something, dude.
[277:44.20]Like, land a move.
[277:51.84]20 seconds.
[277:59.21]There it is.
[278:07.35]Good dodges.
[278:13.68]Alright.
[278:14.18]We're good.
[278:14.80]Clean.
[278:27.66]Is him defense?
[278:28.22]Well, that's why I'm doing speed.
[278:29.98]Speed and defense don't work that well together.
[278:34.07]You should focus on one.
[278:35.47]You can only realistically get maybe three or four stats even remotely increased.
[278:40.77]I could do defense, but defense... I want some of the lore masters to help me here.
[278:44.22]Defense, I think, is the worst stat in the whole game.
[278:48.16]They fixed that in the remake.
[278:51.40]Because defense is supposed to be the worst stat in the game.
[278:56.39]The way that it's calculated is awful, apparently.
[279:05.34]You're much better off just not getting hit than building a shitload of defense.
[279:12.59]So I'm going to go speed.
[279:15.53]Plus, it fits thematically.
[279:17.07]I'm a bird.
[279:17.61]I want to build speedy and dodge and fly and come on, it's thematics.
[279:28.99]Doesn't hurt at all.
[279:33.32]That was a crit.
[279:34.88]Just.
[279:38.56]Let's go for the kill here.
[279:55.58]Any point you can take in defense is better spent on life.
[279:57.80]Well, especially because life works on the expeditions.
[280:02.22]So speed and life, it'll help the expeditions.
[280:07.91]And speed is technically defense.
[280:21.83]I'm feeling like back in the game here.
[280:24.13]I'm not just one button Andy.
[280:25.75]I actually have to move around and worry about placement.
[280:29.58]Hasn't felt like this in a while.
[280:32.62]I could probably one hit kill this person.
[280:38.24]Actually might be able to do it.
[280:39.08]Let's see.
[280:42.41]Don't get cocky.
[280:52.58]Oh, yeah.
[280:53.84]Alright, now go for a talent phase.
[281:00.60]$2,000.
[281:06.16]What happened to Cosmic?
[281:07.24]He ate too much shoe polish and died.
[281:09.76]Alright.
[281:23.65]Back to the training.
[281:34.44]I forgot that was 2000, yeah.
[281:39.51]Oh, should I take those drugs?
[281:42.67]Or will that fuck me up too much?
[281:44.05]Will I, like, get sick?
[281:54.45]Not bad.
[281:56.31]Not bad.
[282:06.93]Oh, I think I sold it.
[282:08.51]No, I didn't.
[282:08.87]Where are they?
[282:13.76]Yeah, this.
[282:15.60]Life and skill will increase.
[282:16.88]Speed will decrease.
[282:17.80]What?
[282:17.98]Is this worth it?
[282:23.58]Does this lose lifespan?
[282:26.80]Or should I just sell it?
[282:32.07]No, it's bad for lifespan.
[282:33.07]No, we're just going to sell these.
[282:36.03]Okay.
[282:46.84]Seems like all the items are not really worth using.
[282:51.11]Because they just bring your total maximum lifespan down.
[282:54.51]1,500.
[282:56.21]That's a lot of money.
[282:59.38]Alright.
[283:11.85]It reduces your lifespan by 5 weeks.
[283:13.61]Your skill and life go up by 10.
[283:14.97]It reduces your speed by 10.
[283:17.11]Okay.
[283:20.33]Alright, let's do it.
[283:26.34]I need to do a little training first.
[283:30.84]Which will do intelligence.
[283:40.19]What about skill?
[283:41.71]I'll do it.
[283:50.93]Hit the prime of your life already.
[283:56.19]I wanna do another Errantry too.
[284:07.18]Alright.
[284:16.94]Intelligence and skill.
[284:25.29]Itchy nose.
[284:32.25]Meditate.
[284:39.80]So what am I looking for in an Errantry?
[284:42.74]It was Papas and Kreia.
[284:44.42]With like the heat one.
[284:50.40]Shit defense.
[285:02.90]You have a Wikipedia page now?
[285:06.68]Cool.
[285:11.32]Only do an error tree if you have intelligence at 500.
[285:13.00]Okay.
[285:25.39]So let's just get it to 500.
[285:26.03]Let's just burn it up to 500.
[285:35.92]Fire Twister.
[285:36.58]Fire Twister.
[285:36.88]That sounds awesome.
[285:40.54]What do you think about Spy Kids 2?
[285:55.32]Um...
[286:03.59]Is that the shark boy and lava girl?
[286:08.51]Is it a different movie?
[286:09.61]Wait, that's a different movie.
[286:19.16]Are you sure, though?
[286:22.10]Are you sure?
[286:29.88]The same director?
[286:33.98]Spy Kids 3D was the best one.
[286:36.32]That was an Omega.
[286:41.26]Oh, hell yeah.
[286:44.02]17?
[286:44.04]We're not even in Prime yet.
[286:44.88]Alright, we have to stop praising because he's getting a little fond.
[286:53.85]He's getting a little soft.
[287:05.30]Spoiled.
[287:06.98]Uh, speed.
[287:20.52]Kick it.
[287:25.80]What's a better game?
[287:27.02]Monster Rancher or Wrestling Empire?
[287:28.64]That's not fair.
[287:29.24]They're both completely different things.
[287:36.63]Focus on skill now.
[287:49.89]I think we can... Oh.
[287:55.69]I don't have enough intelligence to do this, do I?
[287:57.45]Oh, okay.
[287:57.89]Well, come on.
[287:59.21]Alright.
[288:00.04]I'm gonna do the skill one.
[288:10.52]Because it's a thousand bucks for like probably 10 to 20 guaranteed skill.
[288:14.50]Do Mandy for the int move.
[288:16.60]Okay.
[288:16.84]Should I do that?
[288:28.41]It's power and life.
[288:32.79]Or should I do... Should I just go to Torbjörn just for the skill?
[288:38.09]Or Papa's for the speed.
[288:43.35]Mandy for the move.
[288:46.43]How much better is the move?
[288:48.87]And what I have now?
[288:53.81]Save?
[288:53.99]Yeah.
[288:54.43]That's true.
[289:07.62]Mandy gives a move guaranteed.
[289:09.08]Oh, alright.
[289:11.24]Is it Intelligence?
[289:13.74]Is it actually intelligence?
[289:21.81]Okay.
[289:27.93]Mandy!
[289:28.29]And let's fight the plate.
[289:37.37]Yeah, I don't care about the tournament, because I'm just going to skip it anyways, because this guy's going to be unbeatable.
[289:41.94]Alright, twisters.
[289:43.94]I'll just drop that.
[289:44.70]I'm not going to skip it if we haven't seen it yet.
[290:01.92]I love the beanbag Sonic, like, Pepe dancing.
[290:11.52]Got it.
[290:14.10]Are you a Monster Rancher streamer now?
[290:15.92]I told you this was going to happen until I at least got to S rank.
[290:21.26]I don't know if I'm going to beat the whole game, but I definitely want to get to at least S. I want it to level up at least two or three monsters to full completion.
[290:32.27]I'm having fun.
[290:32.73]I think it's fun.
[290:40.46]Did you make it?
[290:43.98]Oh no.
[290:44.38]Did it work?
[291:01.55]Kind of.
[291:20.37]Digimon World 1.
[291:21.25]I'm not really into the Digimon, Pokémon.
[291:27.65]I only like this because it's big numbers.
[291:33.27]It's a really large scale between 0 and 1000.
[291:36.89]I like the idea of pulling monsters randomly that can be combined randomly.
[291:42.56]I like the RNG of this game.
[291:44.22]I don't like the RNG of Pokémon.
[291:54.23]These are not big numbers.
[291:55.31]Zero to a thousand is not a big number.
[291:56.97]Digimon 1 is pretty much this game.
[292:09.34]Well, other games don't exist to me.
[292:14.14]Other games are just not Monster Rancher.
[292:19.49]Just remake this.
[292:21.07]Just remake Monster Rancher.
[292:23.73]Have it be not a remake, but a reboot.
[292:27.77]I don't want a one-to-one just graphical update of the first game.
[292:31.85]Just reboot the whole franchise.
[292:35.43]And instead of there being like a hundred monsters, have there be like 500.
[292:39.84]And instead of two types, you'd have like the main type and the subtype.
[292:46.26]Have main type and like three subtypes or something crazy.
[292:51.99]Don't make it pay to win bullshit either.
[292:53.93]Don't make it like paid bullshit.
[292:56.51]I don't want to open up like gacha containers for monsters.
[292:58.75]Don't do that.
[292:59.37]Please, God.
[292:59.99]I got the new technique.
[293:03.88]I can't praise I want to, but I can't.
[293:07.10]I'm sorry.
[293:07.62]It's 100% would be gacha if it was made today.
[293:30.48]Oh no!
[293:30.86]Stay to rest.
[293:45.27]If you remember the TV burn person updated in the Discord, please look.
[293:58.25]Are you serious?
[293:59.73]Wait.
[294:02.10]Hold on, really?
[294:10.66]It can't be.
[294:16.43]It can't be.
[294:18.01]I need to see.
[294:20.43]I can't tell.
[294:21.21]Is it still there?
[294:27.98]No, it isn't!
[294:35.51]Okay, hold on.
[294:36.93]Hold on.
[294:37.41]I have to show this.
[294:39.67]This is unbelievable.
[294:43.85]No fucking way.
[294:45.33]No way.
[294:46.39]I don't believe you.
[294:51.57]This is one of the funniest images.
[294:53.55]This image is actually really funny because... Hold on.
[294:57.89]The fact that there's people... We have to dissect this.
[295:01.85]We need to dissect this right now.
[295:06.25]Okay, hold on.
[295:09.65]You gotta be kidding me, man.
[295:13.00]The fact that you're taking this photo, by the way.
[295:15.70]Like, you're taking this photo, like, hidden somewhere.
[295:18.32]Like, look.
[295:23.06]There's no fucking way, dude.
[295:30.53]No, that would be so horrible.
[295:40.70]The best part is the fact that you're taking this from, like, hidden in the staircase up, I don't know where you are, but, like, look at these people watching the TV.
[295:49.39]This image is unbelievable.
[295:50.51]Like, the sleeping dog.
[295:51.73]Like, you guys have to deal with this now.
[295:55.27]You guys have to put up with this now.
[295:59.15]This is unbelievable.
[296:03.82]What do you mean this is not real?
[296:05.06]What?! !
[296:18.59]I mean, can we see the angle here?
[296:20.39]It looks like the angle is a little bit... We need to cross-reference the photos?
[296:27.85]Oh shit, you're right.
[296:28.81]That's perfect.
[296:29.33]Let's do some detective work.
[296:32.04]We actually have to cross-reference the photos.
[296:37.72]Oh my god.
[296:39.12]What are you doing?
[296:44.48]What are you doing?
[296:45.24]I...
[296:57.28]Where's the clock?
[296:58.30]Is the clock here?
[296:58.94]It's real.
[297:09.64]What?
[297:16.87]You can't see the clock from this angle, but wait a minute.
[297:18.55]Look at that.
[297:19.69]I see the sound bar.
[297:21.93]Same sound bar.
[297:24.61]The console's in the same spot.
[297:29.00]Dude, let me just tell you, if this is real, this is one of the funniest things I've ever fucking heard of.
[297:34.97]I can't believe that you've ruined your TV.
[298:01.02]You know, I think we need, we need a little bit, we need one, we need one more piece of proof.
[298:06.73]I need, I need this proof, like real proof.
[298:16.65]What about the fake reflection?
[298:19.46]We need another picture, but we need one, or we need a video.
[298:26.18]Or if you can get me a video.
[298:27.84]If you can get me a video, I swear to God, I'm not fucking around right now.
[298:32.56]I am not kidding around.
[298:35.40]If you can get me a video where this is real, I swear to God, I am not kidding.
[298:41.07]I will put you in touch with Community Jake, and I will get you a new TV.
[298:44.97]I swear to God.
[298:53.83]This is too funny.
[298:56.70]But make sure, make sure in your video.
[299:00.26]Well, I will have one of the mods take a look at it.
[299:01.91]Because I want to make sure you don't, you know, no personal information or anything, right?
[299:06.75]All I need is that TV.
[299:13.87]God.
[299:16.70]Okay, let's get back to this.
[299:27.80]I just imagine everybody else that has to watch the TV in this house is probably just... How irritated must you be?
[299:35.48]Was this a new TV?
[299:36.58]I don't know.
[299:43.19]They probably hate me.
[299:45.39]Remember, why are all your fans insane?
[299:50.47]Look, this was an easy mistake.
[299:56.62]If you get us a video, I might, it might be, I might not be able to stop laughing.
[299:59.42]I might have to leave.
[300:04.32]But definitely make sure if you're gonna make, if you actually, if this is not a joke and you're actually gonna take a video, please, you know, protect your privacy.
[300:11.31]I don't want, like, your, I don't want to, like, blow up your spot or anything, you know what I mean?
[300:14.35]Just, we'll, we'll have one of the mods look at it to make sure.
[300:17.37]That's absolutely hysterical.
[300:18.51]Let's keep playing.
[300:32.10]God.
[300:40.04]Look at this.
[300:41.14]Errantry again?
[300:45.87]If this is real, I'll have to probably leave too, because I'll start sobbing.
[300:49.07]I don't, that might be the most, I don't think we can even nominate it.
[300:52.43]It's literally, in four hours, one guy a year nominations close.
[300:56.78]I think that we just have to give that a pass.
[300:58.72]That like, it could be one of the greatest ever.
[301:20.37]I can't focus on anything right now.
[301:22.71]Having that in my brain?
[301:23.89]That's so ridiculous.
[301:28.61]Okay.
[301:29.53]What was I- What's going on?
[301:31.19]Item shop?
[301:47.96]Ah, they are cheaper.
[301:48.66]Nice.
[302:13.07]Okay.
[302:14.51]What was the last thing I did?
[302:18.28]What about the camera?
[302:18.98]Right.
[302:19.20]Sorry about that.
[302:22.90]I'm breathing.
[302:23.46]I'm fine.
[302:29.97]Okay.
[302:32.19]What was the last thing I did before that?
[302:39.76]Bird rested after being stressed.
[302:41.00]Okay.
[302:42.34]Now we can just go back to starting over.
[302:43.68]I want intelligence and skill.
[302:47.23]Go for it.
[302:51.95]Oh, check that.
[302:52.35]I gotta move, right?
[302:58.30]What?
[303:00.34]Yes, gold.
[303:19.29]Kind of hate you to be honest.
[303:20.43]Why?
[303:21.07]What?
[303:24.17]I'm sorry.
[303:24.55]You hate me?
[303:26.09]I don't want anyone to hate me.
[303:29.48]Alright.
[303:39.74]Skill.
[303:40.52]Skill.
[303:52.79]Simulate the burning.
[303:54.53]Oh, I just got like an electrocuted.
[303:55.93]You ever get like a chill that just like electrocutes your whole body?
[304:03.94]Oh, one year birthday.
[304:16.10]You know, a week from now, during the You Laugh, You Lose challenge, the video's not even going to make me laugh.
[304:21.11]I'm going to, like, see that family sitting watching the TV.
[304:23.87]It's going to pop into my head, and I'm going to start laughing.
[304:46.33]Okay.
[304:47.63]Keep up the good work, brisket.
[304:49.67]Seems well.
[304:50.29]Let's do the stress relief.
[305:04.24]Intelligence.
[305:04.86]I want to really hammer intelligence.
[305:06.56]Because I got to get it over 500 so I can get flame tornado.
[305:19.76]Nice.
[305:21.20]Ooh, 12.
[305:21.46]Tablets always tablets.
[305:33.57]Nothing but tablets only.
[305:34.75]Try Dragon Quest.
[305:39.15]I would probably like Dragon Quest.
[305:40.61]It just... I never committed to it.
[305:47.39]400 int and speed from Papas.
[305:49.05]Ooh.
[305:50.11]Really?
[305:51.62]Okay, I'll keep that in mind.
[305:58.16]I should probably do a... Yeah, I'll do a tournament.
[306:00.26]We'll do this one.
[306:08.59]Why are you always broke?
[306:09.83]Every other streamer I've seen has a lot of money.
[306:11.57]Well, I had like 20 grand.
[306:12.71]I just used it.
[306:13.25]I upgraded the house.
[306:15.66]I had like 23,000?
[306:16.36]24,000?
[306:17.52]Oh, I'm strict.
[306:23.11]I gotta change that.
[306:23.67]Do I really like Dragon Quest XI the most?
[306:33.75]Because you get to see enemies on the map.
[306:36.70]That's huge for me.
[306:45.62]Yeah, I gotta be less strict.
[306:56.21]Go for it.
[306:57.35]Oh, I didn't even look at the other- I didn't even look at the move.
[306:59.07]You're right.
[306:59.39]A lot of intelligence.
[307:05.83]I need to get that speed and life up.
[307:09.70]Oh, shit.
[307:10.12]It's heat beam.
[307:15.05]I gotta take a look at that.
[307:20.17]Whoa.
[307:22.71]This character's awesome.
[307:24.94]That's a lot of guts, though.
[307:26.00]It's not a very good percentage.
[307:27.18]Probably does a lot of damage.
[307:36.04]Come on, dude.
[307:36.74]Really?
[307:36.98]Here we go.
[307:46.72]Angry means you're going to miss.
[307:55.95]That's why we build speed.
[307:59.09]Precisely why.
[307:59.85]I need speed at least at 300 before I even attempt C or B.
[308:14.31]Can you do Homer Simpson impression?
[308:15.47]I like that show and I thought it might be funny.
[308:19.97]You can't use that.
[308:28.24]The submissions are over.
[308:30.02]You can't use it.
[308:35.34]Brisket wins by default.
[308:36.48]They're afraid of me.
[308:47.38]could have said no then I wouldn't have offended them for them to leave I I like gatekeep my own new viewers it's weird oh hey guys I'm gonna do this thing where like a new viewer is gonna come and hate me
[309:17.80]I do that all the time.
[309:23.74]But I don't want anybody to hate me.
[309:24.82]I just said I didn't want hate.
[309:26.12]I don't want people to hate me.
[309:27.16]I really don't.
[309:29.30]Look, if you actually hate me, that makes me feel shitty.
[309:34.93]I hope you really don't.
[309:36.21]I don't know.
[309:36.99]People probably do.
[309:40.57]I don't know.
[309:41.21]I hate that feeling.
[309:50.61]Ooh, nice.
[310:02.26]As long as you like yourself.
[310:03.44]Yeah, I'm very happy and comfortable with me.
[310:06.06]I am.
[310:09.13]I'm just pretty comfortable.
[310:12.27]I don't be too much of a dick though, right?
[310:20.16]Alright, good job.
[310:21.12]You learned some stuff.
[310:21.96]Do I have enough items?
[310:32.51]Alright, rest.
[310:33.68]When's the new week?
[310:34.28]Alright, we'll do a rest.
[310:37.96]Or sleep.
[310:38.74]Sleep.
[311:00.13]uh yes drill intelligence I want an errantry let's go I'm sorry for calling you broke earlier I don't matter
[311:27.32]Alright, tablets.
[311:28.06]I'm starting to see increases in the amount of stats I'm getting.
[311:40.58]First time here.
[311:41.48]What's up?
[311:50.54]Okay.
[311:51.70]We are well.
[311:52.28]We're going to take a nut oil.
[311:58.32]And then we're going to do heavy intelligence training.
[312:11.33]Oh, do it?
[312:11.73]No.
[312:13.63]Yes.
[312:21.20]Make it great.
[312:24.98]Oh.
[312:29.88]400.
[312:30.04]Hell yeah.
[312:34.30]Now I'm gonna focus on skill and speed for a little while.
[312:53.33]Let's go with skill.
[312:56.73]I'm gonna alternate between skill and speed.
[313:01.86]You can't just dump everything in one stat and you're just gonna lose.
[313:04.82]You'll get killed.
[313:11.94]These increases are so small.
[313:17.79]What are your thoughts on beans?
[313:23.71]I love beans.
[313:32.37]Speed.
[313:32.99]We'll go with this one.
[313:35.33]We want an Int and Skill from Papas.
[313:47.18]Should be good.
[313:48.62]Ready to go.
[313:57.66]No Tournament.
[314:03.89]No official tournament, because I don't want to lose fame for going up.
[314:06.84]Or going back down.
[314:22.88]When's the next battle?
[314:27.63]Not for a while.
[314:32.56]Not yet.
[314:34.14]Not yet.
[314:44.37]Did I do life?
[314:46.41]Yeah.
[314:47.07]I gotta sprinkle some life in here.
[314:48.45]Come on.
[314:50.57]Otherwise I'm gonna be a little, like, weenie.
[314:59.54]Here we go.
[315:04.49]Play Hearthstone Battle Royale.
[315:05.63]Uh, I have 150 wins in first place in Hearthstone Battle Royale.
[315:13.29]Wait, I made that up.
[315:14.99]I have... I think that's... I don't think that's a lie.
[315:25.53]No, I have a hundred and... I have 150 fourth place or higher ranks.
[315:31.49]And like 50 first place wins.
[315:35.23]I had like 5,000 or 6,000 rating when I cared.
[315:38.29]5,500 or something?
[315:48.21]5,100?
[315:52.87]Win one right now.
[315:53.73]I can't.
[315:54.39]The only way you could... No, I couldn't.
[315:57.23]You have to play that shit every day, and every time they make a new update, you have to play it.
[316:03.24]Because as of now, there's been like 10 new characters and like 40 new cards.
[316:09.29]I'm just getting my ass kicked for like a week.
[316:10.69]Alright, more training.
[316:27.69]What was the last thing I did?
[316:31.04]Oh, fuck it, whatever.
[316:31.68]Alright, speed and intelligence.
[316:35.00]No, intelligence.
[316:36.94]And skill.
[316:48.25]I will never stream Hearthstone ever again.
[316:58.60]I'll never stream it again.
[317:06.37]Am I gonna play Peggle?
[317:13.65]Nah.
[317:29.55]Good job.
[317:33.29]Ooh, really good job.
[317:35.07]Hell yeah.
[317:35.99]11 points.
[317:43.16]I do a lot of spinning like this.
[317:51.29]I was just spinning around in my chair.
[317:53.25]It's probably distracting.
[317:53.97]I'm sorry.
[318:04.07]Speed and intelligence again.
[318:09.17]Not getting hit sometimes is almost more important than getting hit.
[318:15.44]Than getting hits.
[318:30.57]Do not eat a magic banana.
[318:33.19]Oh, it's a glitch.
[318:41.93]Duelist of the Roses.
[318:43.01]It's chess combined with Yu-Gi-Oh.
[318:46.31]Sounds pretty good.
[318:51.35]Speed again.
[318:59.74]What's a game that you could confidently speedrun?
[319:03.00]I actually tried to do Mario 64 recently, just in my own time.
[319:09.82]I was able to do the bomb glitch through the wall where you go like, yeah, what?
[319:13.20]And you grab the bomb and boom, through the gate.
[319:17.04]I did it a few times.
[319:18.95]But then I realized it took me like two or three hundred attempts to do that.
[319:23.61]Like while I was just sitting on the couch.
[319:25.59]I said, I don't want to do this ever again.
[319:36.22]I don't have the patience for it.
[319:42.71]I just don't.
[319:47.06]That's not a fake story.
[319:49.34]I could probably do it right now if I really sat there for like 10 to 20 minutes.
[319:53.88]I'm not kidding.
[319:54.34]I could probably do it right now.
[320:13.70]Do it right now?
[320:15.08]You want me to do it right now?
[320:20.53]Thinking about it.
[320:33.29]I'm thinking about going and getting the switch.
[320:36.37]And yes, I did it on the Switch.
[320:37.85]And everyone says, don't play it on the Switch.
[320:39.59]The Switch has input lag.
[320:40.95]That means... I did it on the Switch with the input lag.
[320:44.49]With the Joy-Cons.
[320:57.60]Never back.
[322:19.37]Okay.
[322:20.81]Uh, so.
[322:29.43]Look what I already have a save point right here.
[322:33.02]I already have a save point right here.
[322:34.64]Why would I have a suspend point there if I wasn't doing this?
[322:39.36]Huh?
[322:39.92]What do you think?
[322:42.46]You want to see something fucking happen on this stream?
[322:45.65]I'll show you the practice that I've had.
[322:56.50]Move this out of the way.
[322:59.42]Can you see?
[322:59.72]Can you see it?
[323:05.51]Oh, you can't see it.
[323:08.25]Hold on, let me... I... Let me move this shit out of the way.
[323:13.77]How am I going to be able to do this shit?
[323:22.34]I need the dock.
[323:25.36]I need the dock.
[323:28.33]I actually think I need the dock for this.
[323:29.55]Because I'm going to be, like, uncomfortable.
[323:32.67]Let's punch again?
[323:33.37]Okay.
[323:39.86]Let me see.
[323:40.16]Let's punch.
[323:47.28]I need the... I actually need the dock.
[323:54.42]You ready?
[323:54.74]Here we go!
[324:01.57]I fucked it up.
[324:46.42]I'm getting the doc.
[324:46.97]I'll be right back.
[326:11.29]I'm not ready yet.
[326:31.08]Why can't I see it?
[326:31.62]Plugged in?
[326:36.70]Put the music on?
[326:37.40]Alright, here you go.
[326:49.84]I'm doing this on stream right now.
[326:51.02]It's gonna be so, like, scuffed.
[326:54.21]It's gonna be terrible looking.
[326:56.59]Okay, I need a video capture device.
[326:58.61]What the hell is it?
[327:06.87]I'm gonna add video capture device.
[327:08.31]What the fuck?
[327:25.92]Hello?
[327:28.24]What just happened?
[327:30.77]Can you see me?
[327:39.27]Can anybody hear me?
[327:44.99]What the fuck is go-
[329:32.20]What the fuck is happening?
[329:35.78]Dude, I swear to God.
[329:37.72]Can you guys hear me?
[329:40.18]I went live to try to come back.
[329:44.52]And this shit was like, somebody's already live on your channel.
[329:50.70]It was like, oh yeah, there's a connection error trying to stream to this.
[329:53.62]My screen was like black.
[329:54.70]That was weird.
[329:57.02]What the hell?
[329:58.10]The VOD's probably so fucked up now.
[330:04.03]Alright, let's go.
[330:06.13]I'm going for this right now.
[330:08.67]I'm gonna get this, I swear to God.
[330:14.91]That was really, really weird.
[330:16.10]Alright, hold on.
[330:18.14]Sorry about that.
[330:19.06]I'm back.
[330:21.08]Give me a second.
[330:23.92]Ask me what the fuck that was.
[330:36.85]Okay, let's do this.
[330:39.39]It's not going to be perfect, but I have to desync myself.
[330:51.58]It's not going to be perfect.
[330:53.40]I'll just relax.
[330:54.22]Okay.
[331:01.32]There we go.
[331:03.81]So now, I have to put this on this TV.
[331:09.24]All the- I'm swear- I'm gonna get it, I swear to God.
[331:12.86]What, a viewer drop?
[331:14.10]Well, I mean, the whole stream fucking exploded.
[331:21.13]He'll be back, don't worry.
[331:24.73]He'll be back.
[331:30.80]Okay.
[331:31.00]Let me just plug this in here.
[331:36.38]Watch this shit.
[331:37.22]You ready for this?
[331:42.72]You ready?
[332:11.64]It's just a spend point.
[332:12.48]God damn it.
[332:16.36]I get it.
[332:50.51]I fucking hate these little things.
[332:53.57]My knees!
[333:24.18]I swear to god I've done this like three or four times.
[333:41.81]I'm gonna smash these into a million fucking pieces.
[333:47.29]I'm getting the controller.
[333:47.97]I'm getting the real controller.
[333:48.67]I'll be right back.
[334:28.33]Oh my fuck.
[334:29.39]I forgot.
[334:30.25]I just leaked the dashboard.
[334:31.43]Now you all know I bought this.
[334:37.57]And I wrote like a tweet saying this thing, but I would never buy it.
[334:49.04]Hello?
[334:49.44]I have to re...
[335:03.89]Oh, change grip and order.
[335:05.77]Stupid fucking thing.
[335:11.63]I'm gonna get this or I won't turn the stream off.
[335:18.75]Let's go.
[335:23.84]Can you guys hear it?
[335:26.14]Is it loud?
[335:29.08]Let's go.
[335:41.39]No!
[336:19.25]Thank you, game.
[336:20.63]Oh, it says I'm playing Monster Rancher.
[336:22.03]This is wrong.
[336:29.41]It's gonna- I'll get it in a second.
[336:30.45]We'll go right back.
[336:31.03]Oh!
[336:45.64]What?
[337:07.84]Of the wall?
[337:51.46]Oh, fuck you, that was it.
[337:52.44]Oh, that was gonna be it.
[338:20.92]DAMMIT!
[338:22.86]Gamer card deactivated.
[338:28.53]Not yet!
[338:51.45]I had it so close!
[338:59.76]Fuckin' goddammit!
[339:15.31]I hate this game.
[339:19.00]Can we break a thousand?
[339:19.90]Wait, there's not... There's not even a thousand viewers here?
[339:23.10]What happened?
[339:24.58]What?
[339:24.82]I don't even have a thousand viewers?
[339:44.88]Oh my god.
[339:47.85]It's 10,000?
[339:48.29]Okay.
[339:56.65]I've gotten it before, I swear to god.
[340:02.08]Okay.
[340:14.67]Dude, this dude's past his prime.
[340:16.63]30, past his prime.
[340:17.49]I'm 36.
[340:17.63]Fuck!
[340:46.21]Oh my god, believe in me.
[340:56.50]Mario goes like this to turn around.
[340:57.98]That's the fucking dumbest thing.
[341:01.02]I hate this game.
[341:34.55]Wait a minute.
[341:40.75]I think I'm supposed to do that.
[341:41.51]Fuck you.
[341:53.05]It's chat.
[341:53.73]What's going on in chat right now?
[341:54.75]What are you guys doing?
[342:01.09]You suck.
[342:01.99]I don't- stop.
[342:02.61]I won't say losing viewers, say gaining viewers so I get confidence.
[342:35.70]That was it!
[342:37.34]Oh my god, I could never do this.
[343:06.22]How many viewers are here?
[343:13.96]Losing viewers
[343:49.12]I give up.
[343:50.49]I give up.
[343:50.85]I give up.
[343:51.19]I give up.
[343:51.53]I give up.
[343:53.03]I give up.
[343:53.41]I can't do it.
[343:54.03]I give up.
[343:54.31]I actually can't do it.
[343:55.69]I give up.
[344:01.79]Just ground pound the pole.
[344:03.37]No, no.
[344:04.11]That's not what I'm trying to do.
[344:14.32]Oh, fuck you.
[344:14.92]You explode already.
[344:22.37]That was the one.
[344:51.46]Yeah!
[345:23.78]Alright, go, go, go, go, go!
[345:33.19]Can you tell that I've been practicing?
[345:36.37]I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[345:52.93]I'm done.
[345:53.75]I'm done.
[345:54.11]I'm done.
[345:54.39]I'm done.
[345:54.59]I'm done.
[345:54.77]That's it.
[345:55.11]I'm done.
[346:01.76]Fucking practice makes perfect, baby!
[346:13.29]What else we got?
[346:14.43]What else have I been practicing?
[346:15.37]How about this one?
[346:18.04]Alright, so we're gonna play Monster Rancher again.
[346:49.24]Never playing fucking Super Mario ever again.
[347:03.93]What the fuck happened there, by the way?
[347:07.61]My stream crashed three times.
[347:14.51]I told you I was gonna do it before the stream ended.
[347:27.06]Fix this and fix that.
[347:33.36]You earned it.
[347:34.26]Well, now I have to do that in like 17 and a half minutes.
[347:38.10]Hold on.
[347:45.07]Okay.
[347:49.31]We're back.
[347:50.01]We're ready.
[347:50.53]I don't remember anything that just happened.
[347:54.75]Sorry for the crashing.
[347:58.81]Should not be a delay anymore.
[347:59.81]What do I want to do now?
[348:08.55]Why are you angry?
[348:10.27]I wasn't angry.
[348:11.15]I mean, I was angry at Mario 64.
[348:12.31]You just blacked out for the whole thing?
[348:18.38]Okay, what was the last thing that I did?
[348:19.86]Which has been breaking a lot today.
[348:23.04]Actually, yeah, I heard that too.
[348:32.91]I think I've rested.
[348:44.42]Let's just go.
[348:44.84]Oh, here we go.
[348:47.40]Right.
[348:47.52]Alright.
[348:48.54]Let's do, um, we'll rest and then we'll take, uh, brisket into the fight.
[349:01.05]I'm glad I actually got to prove myself.
[349:14.72]I want the skill points this should be pretty easy I need to turn the switch off okay
[349:36.08]I love Jerma but I just can't enjoy his non-Super Mario 64 streams.
[349:39.93]He should just stick with what he was good at.
[349:49.86]That's so stupid.
[349:51.92]You know, I was thinking, okay, there's a deeper reason as to why I was practicing that.
[349:58.33]I wanted so badly just to go live one day with splits and actually really desperately try to get like sub 25 minutes.
[350:08.10]Just not tell you guys at all.
[350:16.51]But then I saw how much actual work, skill, and dedication it takes to do that.
[350:22.31]And I threw that idea out the window.
[350:23.59]Alright, let's farm here.
[350:43.16]That takes so much guts and I don't even know if it's worth doing.
[350:51.00]That is.
[350:51.74]Am I gonna kill?
[351:03.94]Oh, not quite.
[351:05.48]I feel like I got a headache from that Super Mario thing.
[351:11.70]Did I really think I was gonna be able to hold it this way and do that?
[351:14.91]You gotta be kidding me.
[351:16.37]I was just too lazy to get the dog.
[351:21.41]Can I have a turn or am I just going to keep doing this?
[351:39.83]Anyone question?
[351:40.33]Are you alright?
[351:42.35]Yeah, I'm good.
[351:56.33]How long have I even been streaming for?
[352:01.41]Six hours.
[352:01.83]We'll keep going for a little bit.
[352:16.68]Six hour Andy.
[352:18.22]Yeah, I am a six hour Andy.
[352:28.17]It's actually really funny because when I was bringing the Switch here, it was open on YouTube.
[352:36.92]And I must have been, I don't even remember.
[352:40.52]I was really tired.
[352:42.34]It was like an xQc playthrough.
[352:44.64]Like he was playing something, like a horror game.
[352:47.45]And I was probably like, oh yeah, get scared.
[352:49.99]Because literally that's what was open.
[352:54.19]I must have been watching it.
[352:57.09]Last time I had the switch open.
[353:06.15]Juicer.
[353:12.67]What?
[353:12.91]I can't say I'm a juicer?
[353:13.83]I'm a juicer.
[353:14.35]What's wrong with that?
[353:15.13]You know the best part about being like a new juicer?
[353:23.31]Is this like 600 years of xQc streams.
[353:28.73]I got a long way to go.
[353:34.13]It's like, oh wow, look at all this.
[353:36.03]Look at all this that's here!
[353:43.76]Stop calling yourself that, you weirdo.
[353:54.62]I got a lot of fame for that.
[354:00.99]Very good, very good.
[354:02.53]Already have more health than the entirety of our training for Calamity.
[354:20.06]Still on the grind?
[354:20.92]Not really.
[354:22.92]I just like having fun.
[354:26.60]Remember, you're not allowed to like other streamers.
[354:37.86]He's cheating on us.
[354:49.57]Remember, you doing that Mario 64 bit gave me anxiety and a stomach ache.
[354:59.75]Alright, good fight.
[355:01.41]Good battle.
[355:11.62]Yeah, you guys keep talking about peep the horror.
[355:15.48]All of a sudden you see a Mario 64 horror and you leave.
[355:18.72]I lost like, well, that doesn't, that's not fair.
[355:21.70]I lost 2,000 people because of the crash.
[355:27.45]That's what I'm going to tell myself when I'm taking a bath later crying.
[355:29.89]Alright, let's go for it.
[355:33.43]Training.
[355:33.71]Grill.
[355:38.21]I want speed and intelligence.
[355:40.83]I want speed.
[355:41.85]When are you gonna do a snowman stream?
[355:48.28]I don't know what you're talking about.
[356:05.93]Tablets.
[356:07.49]Always tablets when you're doing the training regimen.
[356:09.88]It doesn't really snow in Vegas.
[356:12.62]Not really.
[356:12.94]I need to move this camera though.
[356:16.00]It's wrong.
[356:18.10]It does not really snow here.
[356:19.44]Maybe once a year.
[356:20.66]Or once every couple of years.
[356:21.90]There'll be enough to see.
[356:23.18]But not really.
[356:34.35]I love it here though.
[356:36.15]It's really, really cold and really, really hot.
[356:40.44]During December, January, February, it gets to be 30, 40 degrees here, Fahrenheit.
[356:47.16]I like it.
[356:47.46]It's kind of like a chilly, dry.
[356:49.70]I like it a lot.
[356:50.22]We're going to be able to get the new move.
[356:55.13]And then in the summertime, it gets like 110, 115, 118 degrees Fahrenheit.
[356:57.65]I love it.
[356:57.89]I'm a weirdo.
[357:06.40]Alright.
[357:06.86]Okay, let's do... Mint Leaf.
[357:17.79]And then we're going to do the Errantry.
[357:18.73]And I want to do Papa's Errantry, right?
[357:22.53]You miss Boston?
[357:24.79]Um, sometimes.
[357:26.48]I miss the people in Boston.
[357:27.72]Not necessarily the place.
[357:28.56]It's kind of how it is, though.
[357:39.64]Pappas is where I can get the tornado move.
[357:47.22]I think.
[357:53.90]It seems that there is some chance to acquire a new technique.
[358:00.69]Let's go.
[358:02.25]I can definitely handle... Yeah, this one.
[358:08.19]I don't care about the tournament.
[358:08.97]We're going to skip it anyways.
[358:11.92]You going to bed now?
[358:12.54]Good night?
[358:12.88]Well, have a good night.
[358:16.28]Yeah, I probably won't stream for that much longer.
[358:17.86]Once we hit six plus hours or so.
[358:22.42]Which means you're going to have to see Monster Rancher 2 again.
[358:24.34]Which I'm fine with.
[358:27.20]Got it.
[358:27.46]Got the skill.
[358:37.08]Chapstick is this?
[358:38.91]I'm only 30 minutes in.
[358:49.60]Oh, that's right, they can stream crash.
[358:57.00]Start raising skill.
[358:59.45]Yeah, once I get to speed, because I'm going to hammer skill once I get into prime.
[359:06.81]But I really do want, like, 300 speed and, like, 400 or 500 intelligence before I hammer skill.
[359:12.07]Because I'm going to just pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump into skill.
[359:17.41]Once I get out of the kind of adolescent stage.
[359:21.01]What's the flavor?
[359:22.72]The flavor of this bird's bees is coconut and pear.
[359:25.68]It's pretty good.
[359:28.70]Alright, let me take a look at the moves that this guy has.
[359:38.00]I actually do need to do a tournament, though.
[359:46.12]Why do you do chapstick so much?
[359:47.79]Well, because my lips get really dry.
[359:50.73]And I have this sort of tendency to constantly be like... All the time.
[360:00.63]Errantry again.
[360:07.78]Oh, no, that's good.
[360:08.48]I'll take it.
[360:14.53]An honest... Oh, very tired.
[360:16.05]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[360:17.15]Get some rest.
[360:17.97]I'm going to ask you about your dry lips every stream.
[360:31.28]Yeah, I'm pretty much a lizard.
[360:36.93]I do need to buy some items.
[360:45.66]Don't lose all my money.
[360:48.44]I will be pissed if I do.
[360:53.02]Can I sell something?
[360:57.72]Why is the plant one 1500?
[360:58.98]Is there an update on the TV yet?
[361:03.72]I don't think so.
[361:07.11]I don't think we have a TV update.
[361:15.42]Is there a good reason why?
[361:16.40]I saw Connor choke you the other day.
[361:22.44]You alright?
[361:23.16]Yeah, it was uncalled for.
[361:24.54]He just reached over and started choking my neck as hard as he could.
[361:29.94]I was like, what the heck, man?
[361:33.77]I need the money.
[361:46.20]I need the money.
[361:54.22]How many... I'll buy a couple more.
[361:56.74]I can only buy one more.
[361:58.52]Alright, that's fine.
[362:03.89]Have you eaten today?
[362:09.03]Yeah.
[362:09.77]I've eaten twice.
[362:10.27]Okay, you need to rest.
[362:25.78]What did I have to eat?
[362:26.54]Well, you watched me eat a cliff bar.
[362:29.04]And then earlier I had a coffee and some air.
[362:33.56]So I actually didn't eat at all.
[362:35.98]I was lying.
[362:41.31]Battle today.
[362:41.85]No, I need to train.
[362:45.39]Maybe life.
[362:50.71]Should I start?
[362:51.23]Not yet.
[362:51.59]Meditate.
[362:59.63]What is wrong with streamers?
[363:01.17]Um, I'll tell you what's wrong with streamers.
[363:03.77]A lot of us don't really want to eat on camera.
[363:06.93]And the prospect of eating like a dinner on camera or on stream, uh, it's kind of hard to talk.
[363:15.11]And it's kind of hard to... But look, if I were to eat, it takes me probably like at least 15 to 30 minutes to eat dinner.
[363:23.89]So, I would have to, like, go BRB for 30 minutes, maybe 20 to 30 minutes.
[363:29.18]And, I mean, if you're talking about people, um, watching the stream, I think you just saw, the stream crashed for about 2 minutes, and 2,000 or 3,000 people left.
[363:42.04]So, if I disappeared for 25 minutes, how many people would still be here, I wonder?
[363:49.78]Have dinner with us!
[363:55.74]Well, that's another thing too, like, I don't stream long enough to hit that problem.
[364:03.16]Right?
[364:03.38]Like, okay, if I have, I usually have something before the stream.
[364:05.96]I usually eat like a salad, or like a light breakfast or something, or like a lunch or something before the stream.
[364:10.77]Which will, my streams are only five to six hours?
[364:14.77]Five to seven hours?
[364:16.77]Which, that's a decent enough time where I don't really need to eat.
[364:20.01]I have plenty of water and sometimes I'll snack on something.
[364:23.66]But I guess if you're streaming like 8 to 12 hours a day, you have to eat on stream.
[364:32.47]But if you stream less than 6 hours or 7 hours a day, the prospect of kind of taking 20, 15 to 20 minutes to eat is like you're kind of live.
[364:41.50]I'd rather stream because I only stream for 5 hours or so and I wouldn't want to waste like 30 minutes of that eating food.
[365:08.23]Don't yell at me, please.
[365:10.63]I have 90 loyalty.
[365:11.73]Very, very loyal.
[365:17.73]This time, I'm going to do... I'm doing it again.
[365:19.67]We're going heavy.
[365:20.39]Double heavy.
[365:20.81]Okay.
[365:22.77]I'm messing up the regimen here, but I want to do it.
[365:24.57]I want that 500 intelligence.
[365:32.41]Bingo.
[365:35.50]Alright, now we focus on skill and speed.
[365:54.80]You seem like you're the kind of guy that chews ice.
[365:56.33]Sometimes.
[366:02.19]Kinda fun.
[366:10.51]Depends on how big it is.
[366:11.99]I like chewing a little bit of ice.
[366:13.13]Alright, I need to do a tournament.
[366:27.95]What?
[366:31.23]I'm not constantly doing it.
[366:32.53]If I have a little drink that's... Let's say I drink a soda.
[366:34.93]There's ice in the cup.
[366:37.37]And I get to the bottom of the soda, and there's three or four little ice crunchies that are as big as, like, little, um, like, chiclets.
[366:46.90]I'll just go... I'm not eating ice cubes.
[366:59.69]Almost a hundred loyalty.
[367:00.67]This is a big deal.
[367:07.34]I'm going to do skill... Speed.
[367:15.20]And we'll go back to skill.
[367:30.34]So, what would you guys say is a good speed number to be able to hang at A rank?
[367:34.90]300?
[367:34.92]400?
[367:34.94]Like 350?
[367:35.06]450?
[367:35.08]400?
[367:35.10]Oh, the tree's growing.
[368:02.42]Oh, the lore master's left.
[368:19.79]Is the entire game pretty much just RNG?
[368:21.67]Um, kind of.
[368:25.61]It's pretty much RNG, but it's fun.
[368:34.04]I'm gonna run out of money.
[368:34.72]I need to do... Alright, I'll do the Gemini Cup.
[368:37.10]Go rest.
[368:51.54]Oh yeah, I need to do the Monster Rancher 1 thing.
[368:53.80]Yeah.
[368:54.64]I'll do that before I turn 3 months so I don't forget.
[368:58.63]Does fame do anything?
[368:59.55]Fame increases your crit strike chance.
[369:01.83]It's the bizarre back of the in the data of the game code.
[369:08.62]I don't know why.
[369:09.22]It's just if your fame is higher, it's tied to your crit chance.
[369:11.90]Alright, let's get some money.
[369:19.32]Is this based or cringe?
[369:26.81]Rotisserie chicken is the best chicken.
[369:29.65]I would say that's cringe.
[369:31.29]The base take would be a fried chicken breast for a chicken sandwich.
[369:36.94]That's pretty cringe.
[369:57.27]Uh, it's looking pretty good.
[369:59.49]I really need to work on skill.
[370:05.99]Skill and life.
[370:08.59]Yeah, I need skill bad.
[370:09.91]Oh, fuck out of here.
[370:24.83]God, keep kicking this guy.
[370:29.35]That move is not hit once.
[370:30.59]74% chance.
[370:34.23]Am I actually going to lose to Millium?
[370:39.39]I'm going to lose to Millium.
[370:52.53]Finally.
[370:53.47]Jesus.
[370:54.05]Is it an update?
[370:59.65]Is this video proof?
[371:01.95]No, it's not.
[371:02.63]Don't fucking tell me.
[371:03.46]Are you serious?
[371:12.98]I don't see it.
[371:13.70]I don't see it yet.
[371:23.95]Hold on, I need to show... This is funny.
[371:27.99]It's not.
[371:28.51]No, no, no.
[371:28.97]It's something else.
[371:29.89]It's something else.
[371:30.29]It's something else that's funny too.
[371:32.76]Wait, they said so in the Discord.
[371:34.06]I don't see it.
[371:36.26]I need a mod to like vet that video and make sure like it's good if it's real.
[371:42.56]There's something else I want to show.
[372:02.08]This is so funny.
[372:03.12]This is like actually me.
[372:25.69]It's like my face.
[372:28.09]What's wrong with me?
[372:30.95]Oh, yeah, there he is!
[372:32.13]I just, like, want to go watch his stream.
[372:43.00]Alright.
[372:44.04]Do we actually have a video update?
[372:45.42]If we do, then I'm ending the stream, because it has to end after that.
[372:51.56]I'll keep an eye on the mods.
[372:59.02]It's not- It's in the works.
[373:08.62]I can't, I can't believe it.
[373:10.70]It's real.
[373:19.16]It's currently in transit.
[373:31.82]They have to finish rendering it?
[373:33.40]What do you mean?
[373:34.24]What do you mean rendering it?
[373:38.16]Cell phone film and then send.
[373:41.16]What do you mean rendering?
[373:43.06]I don't know about this one.
[373:46.84]I don't know.
[373:47.69]I'm not so sure about this one.
[373:49.15]There we go.
[373:59.60]Double tap.
[374:08.99]You gotta be patient.
[374:09.77]Okay.
[374:10.55]I'm patient.
[374:11.25]I'm gonna be very patient.
[374:15.19]I mean, I'll tell you what I'm looking for in that video.
[374:17.63]I'm looking for, like, a turn the TV off, turn the TV on.
[374:22.40]And, like, from at least three different angles.
[374:27.02]You know what I mean?
[374:27.88]Like, it can't be doctored.
[374:39.70]Unplug the TV.
[374:51.14]I'm mentally preparing for whatever this is.
[375:06.12]I want to hit him with this move.
[375:08.32]I don't even know what it looks like.
[375:16.51]Oh, they might be uploading it to YouTube.
[375:18.21]But they said rendering.
[375:23.01]You gotta have somebody walking in front of the TV.
[375:27.41]Oh, shit.
[375:28.85]Like a body crossing the plane of the television, right?
[375:37.77]Oh, it was a joke.
[375:38.54]Okay.
[375:42.50]I'm telling you, if I get undeniable proof that that's real, oh my goodness gracious.
[375:56.67]It's crazy.
[375:57.13]Part of me thinks that that's just not possible.
[376:05.73]What TV is he talking about?
[376:06.85]He's talking about this.
[376:14.91]I've... never mind.
[376:17.23]I'm talking... I... I... whatever.
[376:19.45]I thought it was this... I forgot to replace the image with the xQc image.
[376:22.83]47 fame!
[376:35.89]Ooh, nice.
[376:37.75]Very, very good.
[376:38.65]Very good.
[376:53.46]Excuse me, he's burned into my Nintendo Switch.
[377:05.29]Somebody said, dude, I don't think it's real.
[377:08.19]It took years for the Cartoon Network logo to get burned into my TV.
[377:17.50]What?
[377:27.90]Yeah, what kind of TV do you have?
[377:30.59]Do you have like a liquid crystal plasma TV from like 2002?
[377:36.13]I'm getting more and more skeptical by the minute.
[377:50.60]Oh, LEDs have burning.
[378:02.77]I'm freaking out.
[378:03.35]I gotta calm down.
[378:05.77]Okay, we're good.
[378:14.73]I'm gonna lose my mind if it's real.
[378:16.41]There's a piece of my brain that's like, Jeremy, it's not gonna be real, so don't worry.
[378:23.24]It's just a joke.
[378:31.06]Speed.
[378:31.80]No, skill.
[379:06.76]I got a message from, uh... I got a message from VRJosh.
[379:14.47]VRJosh says, hey, check your DMs.
[379:17.73]So, it's not real, dude.
[379:19.97]It was a rickroll.
[379:21.19]I'll leave it up to you how you decide to tell everybody.
[379:26.74]I was about to buy a motherfucker a new plasma TV, alright?
[379:41.43]I knew it wasn't fucking real.
[379:42.53]No way.
[379:43.30]Your TV has to be from like 2003.
[379:47.64]No way.
[379:49.28]No fucking way.
[379:58.64]So what the hell?
[379:59.48]Where were you?
[380:03.90]What is the picture?
[380:04.70]Is that actually your living room?
[380:06.36]And you just doctored it?
[380:09.70]I'm so confused.
[380:12.81]That's so funny.
[380:13.65]I want to look at it again.
[380:32.17]Oh, I thought you wish it was real, though.
[380:33.71]Like, that's so perfect.
[380:37.90]The original image.
[380:38.90]You guys are such fucking jokers, I swear to God.
[380:49.66]The original image is this, for those of you that weren't here a few hours ago.
[380:52.68]There's a message in the Discord, and it said this.
[381:04.77]Where is it?
[381:10.10]I'm home for the holidays from college.
[381:11.38]I've decided to watch some Jerma.
[381:12.96]You can read it.
[381:13.46]I can't even read it.
[381:13.96]It's going to make me laugh.
[381:16.82]That was a good fake-out.
[381:17.94]That was great.
[381:24.19]Now thinking about it, this is way too detailed.
[381:31.97]It's rendering.
[381:33.31]Oh, yeah.
[381:40.91]That was pretty good bait, though.
[381:42.46]You had us all rolling.
[381:43.60]You had the whole group fooled for like four hours.
[381:47.88]That was great.
[381:54.06]I nominate that for best one guy of the year.
[381:59.21]So I'm going to give it a stamp of it's already one of them that wins.
[382:03.03]So it can't get nominated because it's going to win.
[382:10.15]I was really hoping we were going to get a fucking video though.
[382:13.59]Even if it was fake as shit.
[382:17.64]Time frame.
[382:18.36]Probably would take a little while.
[382:21.42]Alright.
[382:21.86]What the hell am I doing here?
[382:25.56]Official D. I'm going for Official D. Let's do a little bit more training.
[382:45.81]I want skill.
[382:49.59]Now, I want a big skill.
[382:51.77]Is there a big skill?
[382:54.06]power speed defense and intelligence no there's not a big skill we're just gonna do it this way
[383:02.26]What if somebody actually burns your face into their TV on purpose?
[383:04.93]Well, I talked about that earlier.
[383:06.15]I ain't replacing any TVs.
[383:07.95]If you go and buy like an old LED TV and you burn my face into it and you go, dude, you owe me a thousand bucks for a new TV.
[383:14.69]I ain't going to give it to you.
[383:17.13]We talked about it already.
[383:18.65]If that was legitimate, I was going to, I was about to have that person contact Community Jake to like get that TV and replace it.
[383:26.94]If you break any of your shit and you play, I didn't do it.
[383:29.22]And I'm telling you right now, I'm not replacing it if you do.
[383:32.80]Let's just make that dead serious clear.
[383:41.94]Imagine if they faked it so well that they got like a fucking $1,500 TV out of that.
[383:51.32]I would think you would have deserved it.
[383:53.16]Yeah, you would deserve it by that point.
[383:55.08]Absolutely.
[384:00.55]If a TV has a prize...
[384:08.89]That effort should warrant a new TV.
[384:10.51]Would have to warrant a new TV.
[384:13.81]You gotta respect the grift.
[384:19.51]Alright, when's the battle?
[384:21.19]After this battle, I'm gonna probably, I'm gonna take off.
[384:23.55]I'm gonna get some food.
[384:28.86]No, don't intentionally burn a TV.
[384:31.60]Don't intentionally burn in a TV.
[384:33.56]Don't do that.
[384:36.35]The bit was funny, the bit was cool, but I don't want to wake up on Friday afternoon or something, and there's like 30 images in the Discord of people burning their TVs in.
[384:47.44]Don't do it.
[384:48.16]I'm not even going to click them.
[384:49.52]I mean, I'm not going to click them.
[384:50.88]Nope.
[384:51.70]The joke is over.
[384:56.94]The joke is over.
[385:00.97]I need to do mint leaf.
[385:07.20]That's so goddamn funny.
[385:16.79]Wait, what the fuck are you talking about?
[385:18.99]You look like you smell salty.
[385:20.61]Not dirty, salty, but just straight up like sulfur.
[385:28.09]I smell like the end of a creamed corn can when you dump it out and you just go like this and you smell it.
[385:36.07]Which actually smells kind of good.
[385:50.43]Excellent job.
[385:51.21]That's going to be at least 10 to 15.
[385:53.49]Oh, alright.
[385:54.03]Okay.
[385:55.55]Okay.
[385:56.27]Okay.
[385:57.75]Alright.
[385:58.96]Okay.
[385:59.76]Alright.
[386:11.34]Let's do it.
[386:13.44]Official D over to C. I never do that voice again.
[386:22.56]People beg me to do that voice on a monthly basis.
[386:24.94]I feel great if it drinks from this, really.
[386:39.89]Can we get one more before the nominations close?
[386:44.34]That wasn't even nominated.
[386:45.38]Oh my god, that wasn't even a category.
[386:52.55]What am I thinking?
[386:56.08]It was!
[386:56.78]It was, okay.
[386:57.84]It was.
[386:58.08]Alright.
[387:03.26]I don't think it is.
[387:03.72]Alright, we're adding another category.
[387:10.24]We're adding an... category.
[387:13.98]Last minute category.
[387:14.82]You have two hours to figure it out.
[387:17.29]It might not even show up.
[387:24.45]I bet you can't do Toy Boat for one minute.
[387:50.47]One, two, Toy Boat, Toy Boat.
[387:52.51]One, two, Toy Boat, Toy Boat.
[387:55.80]Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toib- Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toib- Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout, Toibout,
[388:28.48]Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat.
[388:35.90]Lost my mojo.
[388:39.15]How do you spell?
[388:39.81]I was going to do it really loud.
[388:45.19]I could probably do it.
[388:49.25]No, don't.
[388:50.05]It doesn't need to be nominated.
[388:50.93]I'll do it perfectly.
[388:51.51]I'm never doing it ever again.
[388:56.75]I'm gonna get it perfect.
[388:58.65]Just wait.
[388:59.95]I'll get it perfect.
[389:22.74]Don't even nominate it for anything.
[389:24.42]I already did the best one.
[389:34.96]I'm leaving.
[389:49.96]Don't make it a category.
[389:50.82]I'm not going to.
[389:51.66]Don't make a category for it.
[389:54.04]Oh, he's so wacky.
[389:55.86]Oh, he's like the wackiest guy in the world.
[389:59.89]Oh.
[390:06.07]It already was a category?
[390:07.59]No, it wasn't.
[390:08.33]I thought it... I gotta go.
[390:14.36]I need to get food in my body.
[390:20.92]I want to see what this move looks like.
[390:22.00]It just sucks.
[390:23.56]Heat Beam.
[390:26.18]Undamaged.
[390:28.18]What?
[390:35.39]Mosquitoes out tonight?
[390:37.84]Oh, are you going to hit me?
[390:41.20]Okay, fine.
[390:55.29]He's delirious.
[390:56.69]I think the Mario 64 part of the stream took like 10 years off my life.
[391:03.02]I smoked like 400 packs of cigarettes right there.
[391:05.78]Like an hour ago.
[391:21.39]That was an errantry.
[391:22.97]Can you talk while inhaling at the same time?
[391:30.65]I... Nope.
[391:31.37]I don't think so.
[391:54.12]Can you please spell the sound?
[391:56.66]It's just...
[392:00.35]Oh, spell it?
[392:02.81]Ooh.
[392:04.95]Oh.
[392:06.01]Mm-hmm.
[392:08.54]Ooh.
[392:11.08]I have to spell this word for you.
[392:21.82]The category... The category is best ooh or ooh.
[392:27.74]This is not...
[392:29.08]I didn't put that for a category.
[392:39.45]I put it in.
[392:40.07]Oh my god, my eye!
[392:41.27]Did you see that?
[392:42.29]Oh, it's happening!
[392:43.67]Look at this.
[392:45.45]What the fuck?
[392:48.89]My eyelid just like went inside out for a second.
[392:51.11]That was crazy.
[393:07.49]This character is awesome.
[393:08.67]We're not even in prime yet.
[393:12.39]Can you believe it?
[393:14.85]I'm getting off camera right now.
[393:15.97]I'm fucking out of here.
[393:25.84]I can't have that pointing at me because I just act like a fucking weirdo.
[393:29.14]I'm sorry, everybody.
[393:42.40]Put it back on.
[393:44.25]Somebody said, are you breathing in mold?
[393:45.81]No.
[393:48.57]Did you even say that?
[393:50.09]Why did you say that?
[393:56.20]Alright, I'm outta here.
[394:13.74]This is great though.
[394:15.04]Almost 470 intelligence.
[394:17.76]220 health.
[394:19.36]The speed is really, really good.
[394:21.20]Get that to 300.
[394:22.06]Get the skill to 300.
[394:22.80]And get intelligence to 500 or 600.
[394:24.30]That should take me all the way to S. We're never going to get to see that move.
[394:37.81]These are really good.
[394:48.91]I really want one of these dogs.
[394:49.87]Can I make a phoenix dog?
[394:52.11]Is that possible?
[394:53.27]That'd be pretty cool.
[394:55.63]No, no.
[394:57.67]Don't get too close.
[395:16.72]dude don't do that don't get hit don't get hit oh my god who has a higher percentage okay good
[395:48.85]What's on my forehead?
[395:52.29]Uh, it's my eyebrow bone, dude.
[396:06.64]We'll be officially Rank C. And we're not even in Prime yet.
[396:10.82]This is the one.
[396:11.82]This is definitely the character.
[396:12.76]How is Otto?
[396:15.00]Otto's great.
[396:17.12]Otto is very, very good.
[396:28.02]alright let's do so I gotta just just punch low defense I'm just gonna hurt how old is auto auto is 10 I believe turns 11 in march we don't really know so I don't really know
[396:48.60]It's hard to tell because I rescued Otto.
[396:52.00]I did not have Otto when he was a baby.
[396:55.84]Otto was already about two to three years old.
[396:57.70]They didn't really know.
[396:58.86]But... I'm thinking about 11, maybe 11 years old.
[397:09.17]Do a birthday party?
[397:09.81]Okay, I'm going to lose this.
[397:15.27]Let me do a move.
[397:20.82]I won.
[397:21.34]Yeah, I won.
[397:24.54]Skill is now the most important stat, definitely.
[397:26.58]When was the last time you ate beef Wellington?
[397:35.49]I've never had beef Wellington before in my life.
[397:39.23]Just a big fancy corn dog.
[397:41.61]I don't want it.
[397:42.91]It's like red in the middle.
[397:44.25]No, thank you.
[398:03.84]Looks nasty, it does.
[398:19.41]You're not qualified to impersonate Gordon Ramsay.
[398:24.66]I won't make that mistake again.
[398:25.72]Prime rib is superior.
[398:29.41]I'm not a big meat guy though.
[398:31.53]I just not.
[398:34.49]I'm not, I don't like a big roast.
[398:38.06]I like cheeseburgers.
[398:39.50]I like steak.
[398:41.18]Like, shaved steak.
[398:43.12]I like corned beef.
[398:44.78]Corned beef is really good.
[398:46.78]But, like, a big pot roast?
[398:48.10]I don't know.
[398:49.32]Something about it.
[398:49.78]It's, like, too wet.
[398:52.00]I don't like a pot roast that's wet.
[398:54.88]Does that make sense to you?
[399:05.72]Something about it feels wet to me.
[399:09.50]What about meatloaf?
[399:10.76]Meatloaf is okay.
[399:13.38]It's gotta be really good meatloaf, though.
[399:16.25]Some people make meatloaf, they just throw a bunch of shit in the pan.
[399:18.91]Just dump, like, just beef in there and just put ketchup all over it and they don't even like- Some people just make a shitty meatloaf.
[399:36.93]Meatloaf is bad.
[399:37.55]I like it.
[399:38.63]It just has to be made right.
[399:39.63]Almost 100 loyalty.
[399:40.19]Alright.
[399:42.79]Alright, I'm out of here.
[399:44.17]It was fun.
[399:46.90]You'll see Monster Ranch 2 again.
[399:48.28]We have the brisket saga to complete, which is not complete yet.
[399:59.66]Yeah, I want to get some food.
[400:02.02]Did you ever get to A rank?
[400:03.10]I got to A rank.
[400:04.61]I didn't beat A rank.
[400:08.58]Uh, when's the next stream gonna be?
[400:10.05]That's a really good question.
[400:12.07]I have a lot of stuff to do.
[400:13.55]Very exciting stuff, but a lot of stuff.
[400:18.33]Over the next, like, three or four days.
[400:26.22]Hmm.
[400:38.24]I'm not sure.
[400:40.98]I'll get back to you on that.
[400:44.35]It's at least on Tuesday, because that's when the You Laugh, You Lose stuff is going to be.
[400:50.61]I don't know if I'm going to have time to go live this weekend.
[400:56.68]I'll figure it out.
[400:58.28]Expect to stream in the next four or five days.
[401:02.76]You'll see me on Tuesday, guaranteed.
[401:05.95]I also want everybody to understand that there is no more nominations after today.
[401:10.18]There will be, this weekend, the categories, the poll that you will be able to vote on these categories this weekend.
[401:22.00]This is closing in like an hour or two.
[401:25.50]So, make sure you get something in if you want to see it.
[401:31.65]Baby Sensory and the You Laugh or Lose is Tuesday.
[401:35.70]It's going to be fun.
[401:36.52]I've never done it before.
[401:37.52]I feel like it's going to be a good time.
[401:39.76]We'll find out.
[401:40.20]Have a great weekend, everybody.
[401:43.10]If there's a surprise random stream in the next two days, it might happen.
[401:46.74]I can't tell you.
[401:47.34]I'll figure a place to put it.
[401:53.86]What is Baby Sensory?
[401:55.71]You'll see.
[402:00.71]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[402:01.49]Let's end this.
[402:02.62]Let me save this before I do that, though.
[402:03.98]Okay.
[402:13.24]We're good to go.
[402:14.38]Risk of Saga can continue.
[402:16.48]I might change it up a little bit, though.
[402:20.48]Might do something else.
[402:23.24]And then we'll go back to Monster Rancher.
[402:24.68]But I have to do this.
[402:25.50]I have to beat it.
[402:27.52]Figure it out.
[402:32.11]Thank you for watching.
[402:33.15]As always, the credits are broken.
[402:36.37]Oh, shit.
[402:39.96]Alright, well, thanks for watching, everybody.
[402:41.40]Appreciate it.
[402:45.40]Oh, because the stream crashed.
[402:47.42]The stream crashed.
[402:49.86]That's right.
[402:52.60]I forgot.
[402:54.22]Sorry about that, everybody.
[402:55.68]Regardless, thanks for the subs.
[402:57.60]This usually shows everybody that subbed today.
[402:59.62]Really appreciate it.
[403:03.56]I'll see you guys within the next four or five days.
[403:05.25]Keep an eye on the sus.
[403:08.47]Take care of yourselves.
[403:10.09]Don't burn any images into your screen.
[403:11.81]I am not going to tolerate it.
[403:13.71]I won't look at them.
[403:18.60]But thanks for watching.
[403:22.00]See you soon.
[403:26.89]Have a great night.
