[00:27.52]Ah, sorry guys, my...
[00:30.42]My cat walked all over the keyboard, turned the stream on.
[00:33.74]I turned my computer on, turned the stream on, put the microphone on.
[00:37.24]My cat walked over the fucking keyboard.
[00:42.13]How's it going?
[00:44.29]I know that I said I was trying to find a time to be live here over the last few days.
[00:50.59]And I found one.
[00:51.79]I originally thought maybe tomorrow, the next day.
[00:53.58]I was like, you know what, maybe I'll just do Monday, but...
[00:58.88]I got a window here.
[01:01.68]Pretty good window, so I'm gonna take it.
[01:13.10]Dermapanel at the furry convention right now.
[01:20.14]Dude, I'm not gonna...
[01:20.92]I can't.
[01:23.56]I...
[01:29.15]Dude, I told you the only way I'd ever do a furry convention is if I was in full costume and I never took it off.
[01:35.74]I'm talking even in the hotel room and sleeping.
[01:39.29]There can be no...
[01:42.05]There can be no question...
[01:44.27]that anyone would be able to know is me.
[01:46.27]I'm sleeping in that costume.
[01:48.06]It'll have full air conditioning.
[01:50.87]There'll be full AC in that thing.
[01:56.22]I'll turn it on to a nice, comfortable 72 degrees in there.
[02:04.21]I'll bring a book inside of that costume.
[02:09.23]So I can just be in there.
[02:13.18]I'll bring a TV in there too.
[02:17.05]I can just turtle in there and it doesn't matter.
[02:18.91]72 Celsius?
[02:21.44]I live in the United States.
[02:24.14]We use the goofy one.
[02:33.10]The Ace Ventura Rhino.
[02:35.75]Yeah, that is kind of what it is, isn't it?
[02:39.77]Are you going to be like five people wide?
[02:43.42]You don't know what kind of creature I am in that costume.
[02:50.76]Okay, very important today.
[02:53.26]Two things.
[02:54.81]I've been moving the stream around the last week just because I haven't been feeling that great.
[02:58.26]I've had kind of massive
[02:59.46]annoying migraines that have lasted for like days the last like four or five days however long it's been
[03:07.41]I'm still taking care of Otto and trying to find a good time while I kind of haven't felt that great.
[03:15.34]um so no loud noises today we're gonna this is gonna be a very chill day
[03:24.86]Doctor's orders.
[03:27.17]You understand?
[03:33.16]and I'm the pretend doctor in this scenario.
[03:41.50]People writing boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:45.58]That is incredibly disrespectful.
[03:48.67]And it's offensive to me.
[03:50.88]So that is offensive and disrespectful to me.
[03:57.31]We think that's like funny to look, I'm going to make a loud noise at you.
[04:01.42]You have a headache.
[04:02.85]That's incredibly disrespectful.
[04:04.15]It's going to get you fucking terminated.
[04:06.68]Does anybody use the word terminated anymore?
[04:20.21]Okay, so here's what we're going to do.
[04:21.80]I was going to play Infinity Nikki today, but hold on.
[04:27.96]Uh, there's something else that needs to happen first.
[04:32.26]Is it we're going to chill and play a couple of games?
[04:35.52]I might be live for two hours.
[04:36.70]I might be live for five.
[04:37.75]I have no idea.
[04:40.33]This game came out.
[04:42.37]This quarantine game.
[04:44.38]We have to find out if somebody's a zombie or not.
[04:46.96]Seems like it might be kind of interesting.
[04:48.24]I want to try it.
[04:51.85]and I need to complete withering rooms.
[04:54.82]So that has to happen first.
[04:57.55]I didn't promise I was gonna complete Withering Rooms, but I did promise I'd play Infinity Nikki at some point.
[05:04.25]But I have to beat Withering Rooms.
[05:05.66]We've got to complete that campaign.
[05:08.89]So we're going to do this for like an hour or two.
[05:10.38]I'm not going to play this forever.
[05:13.13]I just want to check it out.
[05:13.83]I saw people playing.
[05:14.40]It looked fun.
[05:16.80]Withering Rooms is so boring, you don't have to.
[05:19.27]Anybody that says that should get a 24-hour ban.
[05:25.58]You should get a 24 hour timeout times three.
[05:36.33]You're talking about one of my favorite games that came out a couple years ago.
[05:42.62]How fucking dare you.
[05:48.18]I think there's only about an hour left in it anyways, so if you don't like it, I don't care.
[05:53.56]I'm just doing, I'm doing whatever the fuck I want.
[05:58.64]How's that sound?
[06:00.67]Capiche?
[06:03.70]I don't know.
[06:04.04]I wrote that in the title today and I'm like, yeah, you know what?
[06:06.07]I'm going to say that now.
[06:13.31]4.7K, Andy.
[06:15.47]Is that how many people are here?
[06:17.96]I don't know.
[06:20.81]But Infinity Nikki...
[06:22.74]you have to like I uninstalled it a long time ago and you have to link your account
[06:29.37]And then you have to link that to Steam and make an account.
[06:31.97]And I was like, you know what?
[06:33.98]This is for a different day.
[06:37.05]I actually might play it off stream to get to a point where it will be interesting to see, because we already saw the first three or four hours.
[06:46.94]So I kind of want to get that game to a point where it'll be fun to watch.
[06:50.92]And I think, isn't there like dress competitions?
[06:57.08]They soft rebooted that game.
[06:58.63]Yeah, I heard about that.
[07:06.60]I'll get that to a point where we can show some clothing or something.
[07:11.84]They retconned everything, it sucks.
[07:16.71]You have to do the whole thing over again anyways?
[07:23.50]You've been playing Look Outside?
[07:24.72]I beat Look Outside.
[07:28.86]It's a great game.
[07:29.83]Game of the year.
[07:34.14]Are we going to get sorcery next month?
[07:35.60]Please, God, please.
[07:37.41]That's something you should not pray for.
[07:39.01]Right?
[07:41.24]Like, you shouldn't pray for that.
[07:45.39]God is going to look down and be like, oh, you've awoken me.
[07:50.18]Chatter in Jerma's chat.
[07:51.82]Please, God, somebody's looking for me.
[07:54.14]I'm here, I'm here.
[07:55.24]What do you need, subject of mine?
[07:58.35]Please let him play Sorcery Part 4, something he abandoned two of the three years ago.
[08:04.23]This is what you got me out of fucking bed for?
[08:06.62]Smite that person!
[08:08.00]And then like lightning comes down and strikes you.
[08:15.08]God is not an old wizard.
[08:16.58]You don't have any idea.
[08:18.70]God could be the Earth.
[08:20.06]Alright, I'm not supposed to get loud.
[08:22.42]I'm supposed to chill today.
[08:25.02]God could literally be Earth.
[08:27.84]Earth is alive, guys.
[08:29.55]The Earth is alive.
[08:32.24]Do we know what to, I've already done, we've already done this.
[08:34.64]We did this like three years ago.
[08:39.11]We did this like three years ago.
[08:40.52]I just go back to that last frame from like 2022.
[08:47.31]Oh, the Earth could be alive.
[08:48.47]And then eventually one day it's just like...
[08:56.91]And people would go, what the fuck dude, it's an earthquake!
[09:01.55]No, it's not an earthquake, mortals.
[09:05.45]And you would all shit your pants.
[09:07.07]And I would be right.
[09:08.32]And I would get a position as an ambassador.
[09:11.03]Anyways, let's chill today.
[09:14.44]Okay, this is a game where you have to...
[09:17.46]It's like a checkpoint where, kind of like a Papers, Please, but you have to decide if somebody's a zombie.
[09:22.48]Because apparently people are infected and they're trying to get in.
[09:25.37]Kind of like a... What was the name of that game?
[09:28.17]Don't Open the Door?
[09:30.59]What was the name of that game?
[09:32.20]It was like one of my favorites last year.
[09:33.59]What was it called?
[09:34.17]Do Not Open the Door for Aliens.
[09:35.74]What was it called?
[09:36.95]No, I'm Not a Human, right.
[09:42.91]Uh, it's got that kind of vibe.
[09:44.90]I saw people play it.
[09:45.56]Looked fun.
[09:46.19]I'm gonna try it.
[09:47.87]New game.
[09:56.88]What am I on today?
[09:57.63]A three day long migraine.
[10:02.59]I do not recommend it.
[10:05.71]of a vacation on some sunny beach.
[10:08.83]Not the best fantasy these days, huh?
[10:12.75]This was a crazy one this time.
[10:24.49]dropping in 20 commander watch your step
[10:30.09]So I'm not a stranger to head issues or medical issues in general.
[10:36.17]I used to have a nasal spray that I would do and I would get something called an aura and it happened for the first time in like 10 years.
[10:45.50]I want to say like three or four days ago, like there was static.
[10:49.49]There was like TV static in my vision.
[10:52.06]And that usually precedes like a pretty bad migraine.
[10:55.12]Um, the brain is a very weird organ.
[10:58.64]It decides to do goofy shit to you sometimes if you have these.
[11:03.03]Um, but yeah, it kind of just fucks you up for like a week.
[11:06.27]It's been like a decade since that happened, so.
[11:09.51]Um...
[11:10.37]What was the nasal spray I used to...
[11:11.95]I didn't like it though.
[11:13.39]Because when you feel a migraine coming on, you do this like, and it just, it's like a drug, dude.
[11:19.28]It fucks you up big time.
[11:20.17]What was it called?
[11:22.74]What's the nasal spray one?
[11:26.83]It's a nasal spray anti-migraine.
[11:28.45]It hits you like immediately.
[11:30.93]No, not whippets.
[11:34.52]No, get the fuck out of here.
[11:40.16]No, you guys are fucking wrong.
[11:42.83]Look, I'm fucked up today, okay?
[11:46.02]I had an opportunity to stream and I'm going to take it.
[11:48.58]Listen.
[11:49.78]Alright, we're supposed to chill today.
[11:54.28]It's not a milk voice.
[11:55.51]Alright, here we go.
[11:58.33]Okay.
[12:10.79]Alright, talk to Georgie.
[12:13.72]Is there a punch in this game?
[12:14.81]Why am I asking that?
[12:16.13]Just chill.
[12:16.78]This is a chill day, man.
[12:21.25]And I moved this stuff to Monday, and I was like, you know what?
[12:25.46]Like, an hour went by, and I was like, fuck, wait, I actually have an opportunity right now.
[12:29.61]So I took it.
[12:34.28]Okay.
[12:37.26]He actually showed up.
[12:39.57]You guys owe me 10 bucks.
[12:41.62]Nothing personal.
[12:42.97]It's just...
[12:44.42]We're stuck in Groundhog Day out here.
[12:46.83]Just trying to, you know, not go crazy.
[12:51.65]Okay, so it's simple, really.
[12:54.36]Just shout, next.
[12:55.64]Okay.
[12:57.09]Call a survivor for inspection.
[13:01.44]You can only call one person at a time.
[13:03.55]Left alt.
[13:06.56]Oh yeah, I actually say it.
[13:10.71]Okay, this guy's eyes are fucked.
[13:17.07]Alright, take the fla- I have to look at his eyes?
[13:18.78]Oh, that's a pen, dude.
[13:22.83]Oh, oops.
[13:25.02]Use your flashlight to illuminate the dark areas.
[13:29.85]How is that supposed to help?
[13:34.45]This guy looks alright, besides his eyes.
[13:36.04]Oh, it's a symptom chart.
[13:43.89]During inspection, you can tag the symptoms you find on the survivor's chart.
[13:48.00]Okay, see his symptom chart.
[13:49.57]Identify the particular ailment and click symptom locked.
[13:53.19]If you mark most symptoms correctly, you'll get a reward.
[13:56.15]Okay, so hold on.
[13:58.24]He's got conjunctivitis.
[14:02.48]Once you've recorded the symptoms, it's time to decide their fate.
[14:05.84]Okay, but does conjunctivitis mean you're a zombie?
[14:10.43]still not sure no worries just send them into quarantine let them sit for a few days and the virus will reveal itself okay a friend of mine used to say
[14:20.40]Unless you pee gasoline.
[14:27.36]And then that's when they hit you in the chest and they go, and imagine the money we could make if you could.
[14:31.49]And they hit you hard enough where it kind of hurts.
[14:34.86]It's like, alright, fucking come on, man.
[14:36.75]Settle down.
[14:43.10]OK, so quarantine.
[14:46.76]Multiple zones, each with its own function.
[14:51.12]Okay, so we send people to quarantine.
[14:52.68]After inspecting survivors, you can send them to one of the zones.
[14:57.10]Okay, so we're going to send them to quarantine.
[15:00.04]What happens in quarantine?
[15:11.62]How you doing?
[15:12.48]Hmm.
[15:13.59]You got blood all over you.
[15:19.59]What's the blood for?
[15:22.52]Captain, she's got blood all over.
[15:23.87]Oh.
[15:26.70]You can go to the residential block.
[15:32.73]In four days, we will be evacuating the survivor's block.
[15:36.64]Okay.
[15:37.47]So residential block.
[15:41.63]Okay.
[15:45.62]And send the unaffected onto the block.
[15:49.04]So turn it up.
[15:50.33]I'll turn it up.
[15:53.74]It might be too loud.
[15:54.79]I'm warning you.
[15:55.90]Alright, so you need residential.
[16:00.56]Alright, Survivor Block.
[16:01.60]So you can go with it.
[16:03.31]Send Penelope Morris to Survivor Block.
[16:05.98]Yes.
[16:08.17]What's the point?
[16:12.25]Was she fine?
[16:19.84]Do you have a bite mark on your head?
[16:25.01]Wait, do you have a bit on the head?
[16:28.16]I feel like you would try to at least cover that up with a hat when you come in here.
[16:33.54]Do you know what I'm saying?
[16:34.83]Okay, well you have... you have yellow eyes and you have a bite mark on your head.
[16:41.92]And you also have... a bite mark.
[16:46.56]That means you're infected.
[16:49.49]Okay, you gotta... See you later.
[16:54.21]At least it's not a death sentence.
[16:59.55]Okay, so a bite always means infected?
[17:01.42]What if it was- what if you get bit by like a dog or something?
[17:05.03]Huh?
[17:10.15]Alright, red eyes.
[17:11.23]Any bite marks?
[17:17.64]Bite.
[17:21.52]Yeah, you've been bit so you got red eyes that means infected and you have a bite
[17:31.63]Goodbye.
[17:34.10]We can only fit three people in here.
[17:37.52]What, you need to liquidate these people?
[17:44.96]You need to liquidate.
[17:46.05]Wait, what do you mean liquidate them?
[17:47.94]Why don't you just push me?
[17:50.25]Liquidate them?
[17:52.35]Fuck, they're gonna kill this guy.
[17:58.14]This guy just has it.
[17:59.54]Oh, there's some minor eye infection.
[18:01.55]These are zombies.
[18:02.52]Are they gonna kill this guy?
[18:04.29]This guy's fucking dead.
[18:05.37]Can I move them?
[18:07.82]Hey!
[18:11.52]You killed this guy.
[18:13.13]Can we get this guy out?
[18:16.00]Hold on.
[18:18.73]Quarantine is full.
[18:19.78]How do I see who's in there?
[18:23.20]You can take them out.
[18:28.73]I think I'm still in the tutorial.
[18:30.35]I don't think I can do anything yet.
[18:41.38]Okay.
[18:46.13]Any bites?
[18:48.28]What's going on there?
[18:48.93]What happened here?
[18:49.55]A bruise?
[18:50.93]I don't see any bites.
[18:55.31]What do you got?
[18:55.84]You have, your eyes are fine.
[18:58.31]Bruises.
[18:58.89]Okay, bruises means you're sick.
[19:05.19]But you also have freckles.
[19:14.94]Okay.
[19:15.97]So you're fine.
[19:16.75]So you- you should be okay?
[19:18.07]Does it mean you're sick?
[19:24.76]Freckles and bruises.
[19:26.07]I think you're fine, right?
[19:28.08]I'm not gonna liquidate this person.
[19:29.25]I think you're okay.
[19:35.66]That's it.
[19:36.79]Not that hard, right?
[19:38.44]Also, can you try to avoid excessive executions, please?
[19:43.34]We'd like to keep our jobs.
[19:45.94]Send her into the blender?
[19:47.19]Alright, now I sleep.
[19:51.76]I'm so sorry, dude.
[19:52.95]I didn't understand.
[19:53.64]I thought you quarantined the sick and infected...
[20:03.17]Aight, dude.
[20:03.73]Hey, bro.
[20:04.94]How much you pay me to open this up and just... ...and breathe in a fucking huge deep breath?
[20:10.20]Just stick my head in once.
[20:11.42]20 bucks?
[20:13.34]I'll do it for 15.
[20:22.67]Okay.
[20:25.95]Command Room.
[20:28.85]That was a Family Guy joke?
[20:30.03]No, that was a Jerma985 joke!
[20:39.47]Okay.
[20:43.56]So what happened?
[20:45.33]Okay, I made $1,800.
[20:46.79]It was 500 bucks for maintenance.
[20:50.32]Okay.
[20:53.55]I got no deaths?
[20:55.69]You didn't admit any infected survivors into the block.
[20:57.86]Good.
[20:58.58]Good.
[21:00.75]Uh oh.
[21:10.33]You alright?
[21:18.40]Hold on, Chief.
[21:19.30]I just had to walk around in a circle.
[21:24.52]Alright, what's wrong with this guy?
[21:26.95]Wait, this guy's fucked up.
[21:29.14]The virus can look and behave differently for different people.
[21:32.05]Send survivors to quarantine to monitor their symptoms.
[21:35.96]Why is he fucked up?
[21:39.31]Okay, inspect the quarantine survivors every day.
[21:41.50]If symptoms disappear, the survivor is healthy.
[21:45.65]Infected survivors will become zombies.
[21:48.70]You must clear quarantine when there is a zombie.
[21:53.29]Okay, so not ever, alright.
[21:56.75]Is he alright?
[22:06.83]They always get the middle finger.
[22:09.26]Alright, Mark Sanchez, are you good?
[22:11.25]Well, I don't open the door!
[22:14.30]Don't open the door.
[22:15.43]Do I have gloves on?
[22:17.08]Just let me through if I'm clear.
[22:25.51]You look alright.
[22:31.42]Wait, how do I look at your temperature?
[22:38.30]Can I see his temperature?
[22:39.20]Okay, well, I think he's fine.
[22:50.08]Burn it.
[23:00.98]I mean, these two are definitely infected, but...
[23:11.75]They haven't shown signs yet.
[23:15.81]The infected typically exhibit elevated pulse rates, with body temperature rising significantly above normal levels.
[23:23.14]this device will help you detect infection when there aren't enough visible symptoms she has a bite mark on her head
[23:31.22]Should I just...
[23:32.87]Okay, they both...
[23:40.16]Oh, fuck that, I was correct.
[23:45.55]I got 400 bucks for doing that!
[23:47.78]Okay, they were both infected because they were both zombies.
[23:51.88]Okay, is there ever a case where a zombie comes in with like a top hat on and a suit?
[23:56.72]And he's like, oh, hello there.
[23:58.25]I'm just doing just fine.
[23:59.71]And his skin is kind of peeling off and stuff.
[24:01.68]Does that happen in this game?
[24:03.01]Do they try to trick you?
[24:04.62]Okay, is this a game where they try to trick you?
[24:07.10]Or is it, I have a bite mark on my head?
[24:08.81]It wasn't by, like, a rabid squirrel.
[24:12.50]It was always a zombie.
[24:17.93]A bite mark means they're gone.
[24:22.12]Okay.
[24:23.06]Always a zombie.
[24:24.35]Okay.
[24:27.03]Alright, got it.
[24:30.24]Pulse and temperature can be indicators of infection.
[24:32.17]Use the thermal pulse thermometer.
[24:35.90]Sneezing and hiccuping may be signs of an elevated temperature or pulse.
[24:40.97]Okay.
[24:48.56]Hey!
[24:55.09]This was a really bad time to have two coffees and a bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos.
[24:59.75]Just telling you, I'm fucking gonna have to examine you.
[25:05.86]What do you got?
[25:07.81]Thirty- Ah, shit.
[25:08.97]Can I make this Fahrenheit?
[25:11.46]Dude, your pulse is crazy!
[25:13.62]You're like a mouse!
[25:14.93]Alright, this is it.
[25:15.53]You're infected.
[25:23.64]That is an elevated- wait.
[25:30.12]What's your temperature?
[25:33.53]40, 42, almost 42 degrees.
[25:37.29]You're infected.
[25:38.83]Yep.
[25:39.46]Infected.
[25:40.84]And your pulse is extreme.
[25:43.45]In time, you'll get more tools to help you spot the symptoms
[25:53.24]The disease evolves... ...but so do we.
[26:02.25]I can't go in there.
[26:13.68]Okay, from all the way back there, I thought he had like a crazy face.
[26:18.83]I thought his face, like the mustache, I thought was a mouth going like .
[26:24.17]Hey!
[26:25.80]Bro!
[26:27.23]What the fuck?
[26:35.04]That's way too high.
[26:36.33]Forty... Hey!
[26:37.71]Okay, this guy's gotta go.
[26:39.36]I don't even need to see it, right?
[26:41.81]Yeah, infected.
[26:42.85]You're infected.
[26:44.70]Get out.
[26:45.70]Sorry, dude.
[26:46.20]I trust you guys, but this feels wrong.
[26:53.64]Dude, why do you all have insanely high temperatures?
[27:03.12]Alright, you're fine.
[27:03.86]143 though, that's crazy!
[27:07.39]That's elevated.
[27:08.22]And you have a elev- I'm gonna send you to the quarantine.
[27:13.77]Wait, do you have a bite mark on your body anywhere?
[27:17.91]I gotta make sure I check for that.
[27:22.22]Alright, yeah, you gotta go.
[27:24.08]Quarantine.
[27:26.21]Check on you in a day or two.
[27:31.59]They just got out of the sauna, dude.
[27:33.68]Alright, that pulse is alright.
[27:40.53]Does everybody have to...
[27:41.50]Okay, um... Shit.
[27:53.59]Well, shit.
[27:59.33]I'm still fine, right?
[28:02.33]Oh, shit.
[28:03.44]Don't make me wait.
[28:12.02]Okay.
[28:13.28]Hi.
[28:17.44]Interact?
[28:18.90]Did I just take his helmet off?
[28:22.18]This is it.
[28:22.68]This is supposed to be Crazy Dave from Plants vs. Zombies.
[28:27.83]Imagine liquidating Crazy Dave.
[28:35.19]Okay, he seems okay.
[28:37.62]Wait, 36?
[28:37.94]$36.95.
[28:38.60]That's fine.
[28:41.59]That's fine.
[28:43.47]Alright, what about like bite marks?
[28:49.48]No, you're fine.
[28:50.43]You can go ahead.
[28:51.69]Go on.
[28:59.32]Of all the cameos to have in your... That's such a strange cameo.
[29:04.20]That's a weird cameo.
[29:07.51]Why crazy Dave?
[29:08.84]I just need to get to the safe zone.
[29:10.70]My family is waiting for me.
[29:19.33]Okay.
[29:20.62]Wait.
[29:23.63]Mmm.
[29:25.88]You have an infection in your eye.
[29:30.22]And you've got a back stain.
[29:32.13]Alright.
[29:33.90]That's conjunctivitis, right?
[29:38.45]No, it's yellow?
[29:39.26]Okay.
[29:40.10]Wait.
[29:40.38]Hold on.
[29:41.75]Yellow or conjunctivitis?
[29:43.37]That's yellow.
[29:45.42]I think you're alright.
[29:50.25]I think you're okay.
[29:53.96]Good luck.
[29:56.19]Alright, good.
[30:00.37]This game's kind of fun.
[30:07.12]I think that's it, right?
[30:07.90]Time for bed?
[30:16.52]Is there anything else I can do during the day or no?
[30:23.92]Oh, I can check on people back here.
[30:28.83]Okay, well, I'll do this later.
[30:39.68]You unlock a lot as you play?
[30:41.05]Cool.
[30:43.52]Uh-oh.
[30:44.27]What?
[30:45.62]Start drone control?
[30:56.25]Fire, upgrades, bombs, rockets, airstrike?
[31:00.47]Take control of a combat zone, protect the base from zombie clusters.
[31:09.07]Wave 1.
[31:09.96]Oh my god!
[31:24.21]Dude, remember getting one of these in Call of Duty?
[31:29.69]Oh, fuck.
[31:30.73]Did I blow up the base?
[31:40.83]Dude, I've gotten one of these once, I think, ever in my entire time playing Call of Duty.
[31:45.57]And I freaked out because I was like, oh my god, I'm never going to get this again.
[31:49.30]I think I got one person with it.
[32:01.05]Oh shit
[32:10.06]How do we know these are zombies?
[32:12.99]It's really easy, dude.
[32:23.53]There's another wave?
[32:24.50]Oh my god.
[32:39.89]Is that like a super zombie?
[32:52.40]This is giving me a migraine.
[32:55.28]I have my volume turned down.
[33:03.11]That was interesting.
[33:04.18]Okay.
[33:07.85]This game's crazy.
[33:14.44]Alright, right now, everybody that is so desperate to see me beat Withering Rooms
[33:20.19]has their hands in their face right now.
[33:21.80]They're like, he's having too much fun with this game.
[33:24.15]I can tell.
[33:25.63]We're never going to get to the end of that game.
[33:34.11]Right now, there are withering rooms fans being like, man, you've got like 45 minutes left.
[33:39.25]I will beat it today.
[33:40.28]I promise you.
[33:43.38]Need to eat food?
[33:55.61]Everybody has to eat?
[33:57.06]We have to feed everybody too?
[33:59.31]Switch to base mode to monitor the camp and survivor upgrade buildings.
[34:02.72]We have to feed everybody?
[34:05.96]Hold on, I think I'm done.
[34:07.08]No, I'm good.
[34:11.48]It's a little too sensitive.
[34:17.35]Alright, base building mode.
[34:23.37]Oh boy.
[34:34.56]Alright, more people need more food.
[34:42.34]Build and upgrade to increase your housing, storage, and defenses.
[34:47.35]Power is the lifeblood of the checkpoint.
[34:48.90]Regularly check on the generator.
[34:51.38]Make sure it has enough fuel.
[34:55.81]Okay, so it's like a construction, complete.
[34:58.24]Construction, complete.
[34:59.37]Building.
[35:00.91]Power, low.
[35:03.16]Boom!
[35:03.67]And everything turns.
[35:04.47]You get that jump scare.
[35:06.59]Alright, replenish food.
[35:14.60]A-bomb launch.
[35:15.65]Prepping.
[35:16.47]A-bomb launch detected.
[35:22.49]Okay, resupply.
[35:29.25]How much food do I have?
[35:32.85]How much should I put in here?
[35:36.24]Three?
[35:36.62]Five?
[35:39.15]Okay, he wants me to do five.
[35:41.92]Okay.
[35:47.66]Dude, can you pick up people like in Rollercoaster Tycoon and just like...
[35:56.89]It's not a holding cell.
[35:57.88]The mission is to save lives.
[35:59.39]Does someone in sick care for them?
[36:03.19]You need three critical resources to all survivors.
[36:05.37]A bed, a spot at the canteen, and adequate daily food rations.
[36:11.15]Failure to meet these needs has immediate consequences.
[36:17.05]Okay, shit can deteriorate very quickly.
[36:20.68]Mhm.
[36:22.80]Oh boy, alright.
[36:24.28]A healthy survivor will become sick.
[36:25.86]A sick survivor will die.
[36:27.25]So we need a bunch of med kits.
[36:30.64]We need a bunch of everything.
[36:37.44]Am I good?
[36:38.17]The clinic needs a supply, right?
[36:43.29]Maybe put like two in there?
[36:48.55]Med kits...
[36:49.25]They want...
[36:49.87]The amount of med kits are currently unavailable.
[36:52.32]I need more than that?
[36:56.20]Alright.
[36:57.47]I think everything's fine.
[37:00.49]Power consumption?
[37:06.06]Zone level is required.
[37:09.73]Zone level 2.
[37:10.72]Alright, I gotta go back to work.
[37:19.56]You can play my winter car.
[37:21.35]Uh, probably not.
[37:23.52]Looks fun though.
[37:26.45]Alright, here we go.
[37:28.36]I need more tools.
[37:34.13]Infected That always means infected, right?
[37:41.35]Yeah, always
[37:46.56]Are those yellow?
[37:53.96]Alright, what about bites?
[37:57.67]You look alright.
[38:00.91]Is that it?
[38:01.65]You have bruises though, hold on.
[38:03.10]Is that bruising?
[38:09.41]Hmm.
[38:10.46]Okay, good luck.
[38:13.35]Oh, fuck!
[38:13.75]Their temperatures!
[38:14.79]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[38:23.76]I think you're fine.
[38:24.64]What about the other guy?
[38:28.64]Where is he?
[38:30.42]You, wait!
[38:43.08]Wait, that was a different guy.
[38:44.12]Who was it?
[38:58.28]Oh, I liquidated that guy.
[38:59.67]Alright, we're fine.
[39:04.16]Everything's fine.
[39:05.01]Alright, come on in.
[39:10.35]You are in a quarantine...
[39:11.72]I didn't do anything wrong, I swear!
[39:13.61]...for your turn.
[39:15.14]Remove your outer clothing.
[39:16.69]131 and some sneezes.
[39:21.39]Any bites?
[39:26.34]No.
[39:31.58]That's an elevated heart rate.
[39:33.56]Uh, you're gonna be going into the quarantine zone.
[39:39.12]Wait, why?
[39:40.67]I'm fine.
[39:41.92]Hello.
[39:52.65]Your heart rate is a little bit high, but I don't like those eyes either.
[39:57.09]That looks infected.
[40:00.08]Are they yellow or are they infected?
[40:06.29]Okay, I think you're alright.
[40:07.91]Wait, let's check a bite on your hand.
[40:11.01]Can I see your palms, please?
[40:13.29]Palms?
[40:17.88]Alright, you're fine.
[40:21.36]Thanks.
[40:26.93]Give me a second.
[40:29.10]This is all too much.
[40:31.82]Those eyes are infected.
[40:38.20]Yeah, dude, sorry you... Yep, yep, yep.
[40:40.50]Wait, bytes?
[40:47.33]Uh, you have an elevated heart rate.
[40:53.05]And you're sneezing and your eyes are fucked up.
[40:56.49]Quarantine.
[40:59.29]You... gotta be kidding me.
[41:04.99]I...
[41:07.70]Oh you are dead Sorry It pains me to say
[41:15.53]160 heart rate and a bite on your face
[41:29.06]See ya.
[41:32.90]I didn't let you live.
[41:34.09]In fact, I'm sending you to your death right now.
[41:37.92]What do we tell these people that is?
[41:44.38]Please.
[41:46.52]If you find something...
[41:48.89]Why?
[41:49.57]You know...
[41:54.31]If you're going to start a story like that, you're going to try to get me down on your path there.
[41:59.73]You hold back that sneeze.
[42:01.03]It doesn't matter how much it hurts you.
[42:05.46]You want me to lie when you have the highest temperature so far?
[42:12.00]You're gonna infect everybody here.
[42:15.70]Nope.
[42:16.99]I'm sorry, that ain't gonna work like that.
[42:22.05]You don't sneeze in somebody's face after you say, hey, I know I'm like sick, but can you help me?
[42:27.43]Oh, right into your face.
[42:30.18]Oops.
[42:31.34]Can you lie for me?
[42:32.19]Maybe I would have.
[42:34.51]Quarantine status stable.
[42:36.70]No incidents reported.
[42:42.53]Dude, nothing makes me turn my cart around and go down a different aisle at the grocery store than having somebody just... Just you hear...
[42:49.99]You're turning down the same aisle.
[42:51.50]You're down the fucking cereal aisle.
[42:54.19]There's like a few people in that aisle.
[42:56.10]And all of a sudden you just hear...
[42:59.26]Like, no, actually, I wanted to go to the coffee aisle first, and in about five minutes I'll come back when that's on the ground.
[43:13.84]I think I'm good.
[43:16.77]They stay in there for the day, right?
[43:26.34]If I have to sneeze in public...
[43:29.98]This is bad, but whatever.
[43:31.83]I'll tell you.
[43:33.67]I...
[43:35.30]I go into a meditative state where I kind of close my eyes for a second I go into a meditative mode I'm like that's not going to happen right now we're not doing that
[43:43.94]No, no, no, and I command my body to not do it.
[43:48.85]And sometimes you end up doing the, like, eh.
[43:52.99]Like, your head kind of just goes like, but you don't sneeze.
[43:59.60]It's really probably not good for you.
[44:01.76]But I just hate the idea of doing that.
[44:08.43]If I absolutely have to...
[44:11.30]I pull... Dude, I go full wacko mode.
[44:14.42]I pull my shirt over my... Over my whole fucking head.
[44:19.94]and then wrap my hands around my head and face, and then I come out.
[44:30.92]I make sure I do not do any public sneezing.
[44:41.98]Okay, let's go.
[44:50.46]Alright, let me burn into memory where my quarters are.
[44:53.25]This way.
[44:54.96]Right here.
[44:56.26]No.
[44:57.10]Right here.
[45:07.90]Doing the shirt thing in public is more embarrassing.
[45:09.65]I don't care how embarrassing it is.
[45:26.91]How's the supplies?
[45:37.29]Okay, fuel is key to keeping the checkpoint alive.
[45:41.80]You must keep the generator supplied and running.
[45:45.73]Okay, so I got a fuel.
[45:46.95]We have power.
[45:48.56]I can power down buildings.
[45:53.90]Alright, that's good to know.
[46:00.14]Alright, so we always have to have fuel.
[46:06.85]Alright, we're low on a lot of shit.
[46:11.43]No, I don't... Guys, I don't...
[46:13.10]I am incredibly normal in public.
[46:16.58]I operate so normal.
[46:19.99]I'm just like a normal guy.
[46:21.19]I'm just like, okay, here's the $5 for that.
[46:24.64]Here's the $15.
[46:25.42]Have a great day.
[46:26.47]Okay, goodbye.
[46:27.68]I'm leaving now.
[46:30.03]I don't know, but some people have this notion that like, oh, I like have a top hat on and I dance in the fucking aisles.
[46:35.43]Like I just, I'm a regular fucking guy.
[46:39.86]Stop projecting your bullshit onto my normal life.
[46:45.06]Okay?
[46:54.28]$420, what?
[46:54.82]Say the magic words.
[46:58.45]Let there be light.
[46:59.78]And throw the switch.
[47:01.24]Get a move on.
[47:05.73]We need more med kits?
[47:08.39]There's already zero!
[47:09.80]Why are people still taking them?
[47:13.04]Fifteen twelve hundred bucks.
[47:15.09]No, we're gonna do five Okay, now I need to restart the generator
[47:24.68]Do I have to physically do that?
[47:26.76]How are we doing on food?
[47:30.22]I need way more food.
[47:32.95]Oh my God, dude, we're not spending that kind of money.
[47:39.79]Telling the cashier that you're leaving is not normal.
[47:42.76]I'm telling you that I leave normally.
[47:44.53]I don't say that to the cashier.
[47:55.11]Okay, I'm leaving now.
[47:56.24]Have a great day.
[47:56.95]I just say, alright, bye.
[47:58.47]Have a good day.
[48:05.77]That means more bodies and more pressure
[48:17.50]Oh, we're going to upgrade now.
[48:22.35]How many times have you accidentally called the cashier mom?
[48:25.20]I don't... Have you done that?
[48:30.11]You've called the cashier mom?
[48:33.99]Like, thanks, mom.
[48:36.10]That's never happened in my 40 years on this planet.
[48:46.51]I've done the... the like, oh yeah, you too, when they didn't even say anything.
[48:54.29]Like they'll be like, oh, they'll say, for instance, like, oh, like, thanks.
[48:59.64]You too.
[49:00.10]I was like, oh, but I guess that makes sense.
[49:02.68]You know what I'm talking about?
[49:03.60]When you say something where there was no context before it,
[49:06.66]It's just like a ride and a bike conversation stuff.
[49:13.21]It's funny, I can't think of the exact way that happens.
[49:20.97]Like, oh, that'll be $15.99.
[49:23.54]Oh, you too.
[49:26.33]Right.
[49:30.49]Okay.
[49:30.99]I got research points.
[49:38.41]Okay, upgrade the base.
[49:43.89]upgrades alright we need to be base level two 300 upgrade points
[49:52.90]Everyone literally said a better analogy than you did.
[49:59.27]That's why I asked.
[50:05.45]OK, now go to the generator and we have to power.
[50:08.72]4000 bucks dude.
[50:12.45]Come on, I only have $4000.
[50:16.30]Everything in this camp requires power.
[50:18.96]More buildings and bigger facilities means more power.
[50:24.28]Yeah, that's a good one.
[50:25.19]That's a good way.
[50:26.70]Not a cashier.
[50:28.17]That happens mostly at a restaurant.
[50:31.39]It's like, oh, enjoy your meal.
[50:33.08]Yeah, you too.
[50:34.97]Yeah, that's a good example of that.
[50:39.46]See this?
[50:40.28]It's usually used to test reflexes.
[50:42.57]The infected have slowed reactions.
[50:45.01]You'll notice the difference right away.
[50:47.42]No need to reinvent the wheel, or hammer on this one.
[50:51.20]Personally, I'd like to see a bat wrapped in barbed wire.
[50:54.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[50:58.69]License and registration please.
[51:02.24]Yeah, you too.
[51:07.33]Yeah, but you're not leaving that conversation.
[51:09.34]Take the reflex hammer?
[51:17.46]You can hit people now?
[51:18.46]Slow and dulled reflexes are a new symptom of the virus.
[51:21.95]Use the reflex hammer.
[51:24.98]Only use this on the arms or legs.
[51:26.67]Hitting a survivor on the head will hurt them.
[51:30.08]A slack jaw may indicate a potential issue with muscular reflexes.
[51:38.97]Let's go.
[51:44.80]Okay, that- so that-
[51:50.01]Whoa!
[51:50.49]Why'd you punch me?
[51:51.70]What the fuck was that?
[51:54.09]I'm testing your reflexes!
[52:06.78]Wait, that was hyper-aggressive!
[52:12.37]Reacts with the opposite... Yeah, that was an aggressive attack.
[52:16.81]You need to go to quarantine.
[52:28.16]Anything else?
[52:37.46]Don't skip the paperwork step.
[52:40.71]That's kind of elevated.
[52:44.87]okay um the slack jaw does that mean that that if they don't react then it's fine
[52:58.27]Oh shit, needs cleaning.
[53:09.15]What about the other two people?
[53:10.38]Can I open the...
[53:21.56]I'm sorry, ma'am.
[53:22.70]Let me get back to what we were just doing.
[53:25.87]I would like for you to go into this room, please.
[53:28.66]Sure.
[53:29.95]What else could go wrong?
[53:33.69]Okay.
[53:46.58]Wait, that's dulled reflex, right?
[53:49.34]Is that a dulled reflex?
[53:53.97]Oh, okay.
[53:54.68]No, you're fine.
[53:56.50]Uh, what about the other shit?
[53:58.37]You've got freckles.
[54:01.73]Anything else?
[54:02.35]Any bites?
[54:10.61]I think you're fine.
[54:11.70]Oh, fuck!
[54:15.72]The temperature!
[54:22.98]Are you alright?
[54:29.28]Shit, if she turns and starts eating people, what do I do?
[54:37.80]I think she's fine She's fine
[54:52.66]I'm doing this first.
[54:56.99]You're fine, at least in that regard.
[55:01.84]No bites on you.
[55:05.49]Okay, what about your reflexes?
[55:11.62]Dead.
[55:13.88]What could be worse?
[55:18.53]Oh, somebody said I had to make sure I mark it, otherwise I get less money.
[55:28.39]I almost hit the guy right in the head.
[55:30.64]Okay, that seems like you're reactive to that.
[55:38.41]I think you're fine though temperature
[55:52.37]No, you're totally clean.
[55:54.98]You are good to go.
[55:55.62]Welcome to the quarantine.
[56:00.13]Have a nice day.
[56:02.19]Thanks for... ...letting me live a bit, at least.
[56:08.13]Come on!
[56:08.98]You have to believe me!
[56:14.95]That's elevated.
[56:23.00]And you're-
[56:30.59]Alright, bro.
[56:31.58]You know what?
[56:33.30]Get in there.
[56:35.50]Aggressive attack.
[56:39.90]Sneezing.
[56:41.70]Elevated temperature.
[56:42.91]And you've got conjunctivitis.
[56:49.89]This has to be a mistake.
[56:54.42]What the fuck are you doing?
[57:06.30]Does it matter how close you are?
[57:13.91]fights.
[57:18.08]Alright, what about this?
[57:22.53]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
[57:27.48]So... Move it!
[57:35.63]Where am I going now?
[57:38.85]Hold on.
[57:48.49]That temperature is too high as well.
[57:49.96]Alright, mark that.
[57:51.65]Any bites?
[57:52.94]I want the extra money.
[57:58.49]way too high and this shit
[58:07.05]Thanks for at least letting me win.
[58:09.84]Excellent inspection.
[58:10.69]I got nine RP points.
[58:17.53]How are you guys doing?
[58:27.87]OK.
[58:30.77]Check on the base.
[58:33.82]Canteens got plenty of food.
[58:36.48]Got plenty of med kits.
[58:37.98]Generator's doing alright.
[58:38.99]Got plenty of fuel.
[58:42.87]Uh, tents.
[58:45.81]How many survivors are in here?
[58:52.81]OK, we're good.
[59:11.26]This has to be a bug.
[59:12.00]There's literally a smokestack on the liquidation building.
[59:14.71]What do they think is happening in there?
[59:16.28]A barbecue.
[59:21.62]Dude, I feel like you would probably know if you're at the, hey, everybody's turning into a zombie checkpoint.
[59:37.26]We need to do food.
[59:52.57]Alright, canteen.
[59:57.71]We'll do five in there.
[59:59.28]How much?
[59:59.50]I got 2,200 bucks.
[60:00.78]Let me upgrade this.
[60:03.74]passively creates eight units of food a day.
[60:06.49]Damn.
[60:06.89]Alright, I need three grand.
[60:13.59]I need more food in here?
[60:15.49]Dude, too many people are eating.
[60:31.36]Attention evacuation convoy arriving today.
[60:34.57]Oh
[60:40.49]I'll let my tool do to be the judge of that one.
[60:50.70]Pulse is a little elevated.
[60:55.23]You eating anything out of the dumpster lately?
[60:59.29]That could elevate the pulse a little.
[61:03.89]Any international travel in the last few weeks?
[61:07.35]Hmm.
[61:09.92]consume any undercooked beef in the last month or so.
[61:20.65]Mm-hmm.
[61:22.62]Aggressive.
[61:25.10]Conjunctivitis, it seems.
[61:29.96]Huh.
[61:30.06]Okay.
[61:31.47]Oh, hold on a second.
[61:35.79]Hmm.
[61:39.13]Hmm.
[61:42.27]How are you feeling?
[61:44.97]Give me a second.
[61:46.55]This is all too much.
[61:47.98]Your eyes have cleared.
[61:49.85]That's very good.
[61:51.06]Pulse is a little elevated still.
[61:55.01]Nothing too concerning, though.
[61:56.48]I mean, when people go to the doctor, their blood pressure does tend to increase.
[62:05.22]Okay, I think you are alright.
[62:11.02]I think you can go.
[62:13.69]Have a nice day.
[62:16.60]Good reflexes?
[62:18.79]Wait.
[62:19.61]No.
[62:22.85]I have to uncheck these, right?
[62:29.18]Have a nice day.
[62:31.74]What about you?
[62:34.52]How are you doing?
[62:42.09]Attention, evacuation convoy arriving today.
[62:45.33]Okay, you are aggressive and you have conjunctivitis.
[62:52.47]Into the quarantine, please.
[63:00.86]Uh oh.
[63:09.16]Uh oh, 40, not quite 41.
[63:12.19]Are you still a zombie though?
[63:16.12]Is anything over 40, right?
[63:20.70]What is 40 Celsius to Fahrenheit?
[63:24.92]Can I make it Fahrenheit?
[63:33.73]I think you gotta go into quarantine.
[63:37.69]It's about 103 104.
[63:38.79]Oh my God.
[63:45.05]How many bites?
[63:47.74]No.
[63:48.57]Alright, you gotta go quarantine.
[63:51.30]Wait.
[63:54.91]That's the absence of any reflexes.
[64:03.33]Where the hell is it?
[64:04.01]Here.
[64:05.26]Alright.
[64:05.72]Quarantine.
[64:08.24]Come on.
[64:12.39]This guy's got a bag on his head.
[64:14.94]This person's a skeleton.
[64:27.51]Alright, well, you're a skeleton.
[64:40.17]A skeleton can't get bitten.
[64:41.84]Yeah, because he was bitten two or three months ago.
[64:48.79]The person's infected.
[64:49.63]Alright.
[64:49.85]What about bites?
[64:59.88]That was an opposite reaction.
[65:08.93]Wow!
[65:11.45]Ah, come on buddy.
[65:19.50]I'm not sick.
[65:20.19]Don't send me to liquidation.
[65:22.18]Please.
[65:22.48]I thought we were friends.
[65:28.41]Goodbye.
[65:30.04]Boy arriving today.
[65:31.11]I didn't do anything wrong, I swear.
[65:36.94]You killed him.
[65:38.08]Yeah, I'm not sending anybody infected into my... ...quarantine.
[65:45.18]That's fine.
[65:45.66]Your eyes look fine.
[65:51.87]Are you good?
[65:56.31]You're good.
[65:58.14]Have a nice day.
[66:01.15]Don't make me wait
[66:10.62]We're out of room.
[66:11.50]Do we even have any more room for anybody?
[66:13.56]There's two more people we can even put in here.
[66:30.92]that.
[66:32.69]Alright, aggressive.
[66:35.50]Ah, that is a quarantine.
[66:36.89]The quarantine is full!
[66:37.81]Uh oh.
[66:38.78]What do I do in this scenario?
[66:39.92]Do I have to upgrade it?
[66:42.43]Quarantine status stable no incidents reported Can I have this guy get out
[66:54.22]What the fuck, dude?
[66:55.41]That's the quickest way to get yourself back in.
[66:57.50]I just need to get to the safe zone.
[66:59.29]My family is waiting for me.
[67:02.22]You hold that in with all of your might, I'm sorry.
[67:08.85]But you're still sick!
[67:14.24]Your eyes look better.
[67:15.04]What about the reflexes?
[67:17.55]Are you still aggressive?
[67:20.09]Get back in there.
[67:22.76]But what do I do with this guy?
[67:27.62]I just did!
[67:29.57]Alright, but no- but how-
[67:43.68]Oh shit, okay.
[67:45.52]There we go.
[67:47.89]I can put another person in there.
[67:48.84]Good.
[67:56.29]Alright, so that was an aggressive attack, right?
[67:59.07]Yep.
[68:02.41]I think that's the only symptom that she has.
[68:04.24]Alright.
[68:04.42]Aggressive attack.
[68:05.87]Into the quarantine.
[68:07.41]Goodbye.
[68:10.24]Dead.
[68:24.35]Ah, you're dead.
[68:26.50]Bites.
[68:27.47]We haven't seen anybody with a bite recently.
[68:28.83]Alright, so you got a bite.
[68:30.02]What about your...
[68:32.91]You got a bite and you're aggressive.
[68:39.52]And you're making the sound effect that the mimes make when you attack them in Expedition 33.
[68:43.44]See you later.
[68:58.74]We've truly lost him expedition 33 reference.
[69:01.72]That's a great game.
[69:02.60]Alright.
[69:04.17]I'm healthy.
[69:07.62]Sometimes I like to talk a little shit too.
[69:12.11]It's a great game.
[69:14.80]That is a great game.
[69:15.61]That is like a 9.0.
[69:20.06]I'm not going to give it higher than a 9.0, but I do think the story, I think the atmosphere, I think it's a great game.
[69:25.17]I think it's a very unique game.
[69:31.94]Now you know what?
[69:32.80]Fuck that.
[69:33.24]It's going in the top 300.
[69:34.11]I don't give a shit.
[69:39.27]Okay, you're fine.
[69:41.83]That's fine.
[69:42.41]No bites?
[69:46.80]I think you're good.
[69:56.05]What's your 275th favorite game?
[70:04.02]Uh, well, wouldn't... you must... you must have not have heard.
[70:07.27]Should we tell him?
[70:10.27]Should we tell him?
[70:17.11]My pulse is a little high, but you're alright.
[70:21.21]Okay, but the slack draw means that that can happen, right?
[70:25.84]So that's okay.
[70:28.33]Right?
[70:32.77]Any bites?
[70:37.97]I think you're okay.
[70:39.35]I'm out of space though.
[70:41.52]Shit.
[70:41.94]Hold on.
[70:51.35]Alerts if metal is detected in baggage.
[70:54.66]Wait.
[70:56.53]How do I increase the, uh, the amount of people that can stay here?
[71:03.55]There we go.
[71:04.05]Alright.
[71:05.87]Uh, capacity for 15 people.
[71:12.90]Wait, we need more food too.
[71:14.34]People are starving.
[71:25.17]Okay we're good.
[71:36.47]Congratulations, you've made it to the survivor block.
[71:46.55]Whoa!
[71:50.91]Yeah, I'm sorry dude, but that's... Yeah, you're fucking dead.
[71:55.95]Alright.
[72:00.15]Well, we all know you're dead.
[72:01.66]But I'll look for a bite.
[72:03.56]Yep.
[72:04.34]Bite.
[72:06.32]Bite, pulse, and...
[72:08.13]The other one is bad.
[72:15.94]What was your pulse?
[72:16.55]Your pulse was huge!
[72:21.11]Yeah, you are... You are dead.
[72:25.73]Oh, I forgot to say, uh, yeah.
[72:27.37]So, dude, I'm getting so excited.
[72:32.04]I cannot wait to do that stream.
[72:33.59]For those that don't know.
[72:36.54]And that guy that said, what is your top 2700, 275th game?
[72:41.26]And they were being a little...
[72:43.19]They were being a little cute about it.
[72:45.57]We're going to find out.
[72:48.99]I'm going to be doing a...
[72:50.69]I know he's repeating himself.
[72:52.74]I know, I know.
[72:53.14]But there's people that just weren't here.
[72:55.23]Don't you understand how this works?
[72:58.37]Oh, wait.
[72:59.05]Execute the evacuation?
[73:01.02]Oh, and I was like, what do you mean execute?
[73:05.89]How do I get over there?
[73:16.75]the computer.
[73:21.69]We're going to be figuring out what my favorite games of all time are.
[73:26.67]It's also the most impactful games of all time.
[73:28.74]I sat around for months
[73:30.55]and thought of every single video game I've ever cared about.
[73:33.92]We're going to play some elimination games with them, a website.
[73:37.15]A game is being made with all of my top, like, it's like going to be top 330.
[73:42.43]most impactful, most things that caused an impact to me.
[73:48.13]It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[73:49.14]I'm gonna drink a bottle of wine on that stream.
[73:51.87]It's gonna be a really fun day.
[73:57.55]Okay.
[74:02.58]Is Chrono Trigger gonna win?
[74:03.68]I- I don't know.
[74:05.86]The whole point is that I don't know.
[74:07.91]We're gonna figure out where they all go.
[74:11.22]What day is that?
[74:12.51]I will let you know very well in advance.
[74:14.24]Alright, everyone has a role to play.
[74:15.67]Each man has a role to play.
[74:17.46]Survivors cannot stay at the checkpoint forever.
[74:20.77]The science division and the military need all the help that they can get.
[74:24.98]Select survivors to go to the science division.
[74:27.45]Ooh.
[74:33.26]Okay.
[74:34.29]Well, I want more money.
[74:41.73]Does it show their stats?
[74:42.86]Is this guy smarter or more powerful?
[75:03.73]Oh, Crazy Dave definitely has to go to the military truck, right?
[75:13.27]Should I stop there?
[75:22.03]Or should I get rid of more people?
[75:29.38]Just send them all?
[75:30.49]I feel like it's a- is there a problem if I don't send them all?
[75:36.64]Send them all!
[75:38.29]Get rid of everyone.
[75:42.16]But what if I have no more people left?
[75:44.59]Do I need people at the base?
[75:55.39]You need space for more people.
[75:56.88]Alright, so let's go.
[75:57.73]I just sent everybody.
[76:04.80]Where's my money?
[76:05.41]Okay.
[76:16.13]Where's my money?
[76:26.79]$1,000 for an evacuation?
[76:30.03]I thought I was gonna get like five grand.
[76:44.58]The required number of people have been evacuated.
[76:46.93]I think... Oh, we need more... Oh, I get it.
[76:49.58]Remember, quotas are our main mission.
[76:51.99]If we fail them a couple of times and...
[76:54.57]I forgot the delivery fee.
[77:01.62]Come see me.
[77:11.32]Hey George.
[77:14.55]Hmm.
[77:16.98]Sometimes we'll be hidden under a clothing use the scanner to examine survivors Oh my god, we have to fucking do like the x-ray vision shit to find bites.
[77:26.29]Give me a break.
[77:27.41]Beauty, isn't it?
[77:29.11]This scanner can see right through clothing, pick out scars, bites.
[77:33.20]A real Marvel of technology.
[77:35.39]Keep this away from the perverts.
[77:37.40]Thank you.
[77:48.10]I just want to see if you could do it to anybody.
[77:56.41]This is all okay.
[77:57.20]It only works on survivors.
[77:59.59]Don't make me wait.
[78:05.65]I feel like that would be bad, right?
[78:06.89]Don't look directly into this.
[78:11.75]This is going to be such a pain in the ass.
[78:13.46]This is going to suck.
[78:16.26]Oh, my God.
[78:17.20]Okay.
[78:18.19]This is going to be so annoying.
[78:19.43]I'm going to miss a bite on somebody.
[78:26.44]What the fuck?
[78:27.28]Okay.
[78:28.19]Alright, well...
[78:29.78]I don't think he had a bite.
[78:41.79]Well, you are not quite... No, not infected.
[78:53.79]Hi.
[78:54.22]Ummm...
[78:59.16]Green skin?
[79:00.66]Okay, if you come in here with green skin, you're infected.
[79:02.99]There's new stuff here.
[79:04.05]Alright, hold on.
[79:05.00]I think that's redness.
[79:10.34]And you were aggressive.
[79:15.00]Wait!
[79:18.04]Identification verified.
[79:20.15]Stop moving.
[79:22.48]Let me see your eyes.
[79:24.63]Your eyes are still fucked up.
[79:25.85]What about you?
[79:26.95]Get out of here.
[79:33.29]Oh my god, okay.
[79:39.67]Do I have to do this to every single fucking person?
[79:49.09]You're still aggressive!
[79:50.87]Stop being so aggressive!
[79:52.28]You should be get...
[79:59.57]Well, I... What about you?
[80:02.55]Are you still aggressive?
[80:09.37]This is just a bad dream.
[80:11.82]No, okay.
[80:14.22]Is the temperature still fine?
[80:19.72]I think you're good.
[80:20.44]You gotta see if they're getting better or worse, not cured.
[80:25.08]I mean, he technically is better.
[80:34.11]Okay, no bites.
[80:39.08]Jesus.
[80:40.81]Okay.
[80:41.13]I think you're fine.
[80:43.53]Are you fine?
[80:44.45]I think you're fine.
[80:53.26]Are you good?
[80:53.73]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[81:00.62]No, you're gonna go back in.
[81:04.69]You've gotta be kidding me!
[81:10.14]This guy's still sitting here.
[81:12.72]Okay, so you- I need you- You gotta go in quarantine.
[81:17.02]Your symptoms are, you got the red skin, you've got the high- elevated temperature, and you're aggressive.
[81:25.05]Alright, let's go.
[81:27.84]I'm on him
[81:32.60]You have to believe me.
[81:34.35]Okay.

[81:37.46]You look okay.
[81:41.97]You look okay.
[81:44.36]Okay.
[81:46.94]That's fine.
[81:48.16]What about temperature?
[81:58.45]I think you're good.
[82:01.96]You're good.
[82:04.83]Come on in.
[82:11.23]39?
[82:11.49]Oh, 40?
[82:20.34]Oh, you know what?
[82:21.83]You got saved by the margin of error on this device.
[82:29.32]Prepare your belongings for inspection.
[82:32.81]Is that actually though?
[82:34.04]Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
[82:35.59]Quarantine though.
[82:36.29]Fuck, I don't have- I need more quarantine space.
[82:44.66]I need a level 3 zone.
[82:47.87]Shit.
[82:49.08]Okay, uh... How do I do that again?
[83:01.09]I need more research points.
[83:08.33]Just get rid of people in the quarantine?
[83:09.96]These people, I don't know if they're sick still.
[83:12.27]I'm not just going to torch everybody in here.
[83:21.82]Orange Shirt Man did nothing wrong.
[83:23.73]Orange Shirt Man is still aggressive.
[83:32.40]Her eyes are still fucked up.
[83:34.83]Her eyes are still fucked up.
[83:39.20]He's...
[83:42.23]Wait a minute.
[83:42.94]Are you alright?
[83:45.49]No, you're not.
[83:46.16]Get back in there.
[83:51.16]This guy's sick.
[83:52.33]I don't want to make everybody sick.
[83:55.65]Crying out loud.
[83:59.56]I don't have enough.
[84:00.34]I need more.
[84:00.97]How do I get more research points?
[84:11.38]Wait, did I check for bytes?
[84:14.72]Oh, wait a minute.
[84:15.40]That's a pretty big bite or whatever it is.
[84:20.12]That's a huge bruise or infection bite.
[84:27.75]No?
[84:31.24]Wait No?
[84:36.55]What does that mean?
[84:40.69]Does that mean infection?
[84:46.46]Is that just a bruise?
[84:49.85]Or is that necrosis?
[84:56.83]It's a red bruise.
[84:59.96]Oh, shit.
[85:01.04]Yeah, but you gotta go quarantine.
[85:05.02]What happens if you don't have any more room?
[85:06.87]I just have to...
[85:08.09]I gotta send this guy out of here.
[85:10.78]Quarantine status, stable.
[85:13.34]No incidents reported.
[85:17.12]If you cause any trouble, I'm going to detain me, right?
[85:20.58]Just don't cause any trouble.
[85:27.21]Don't make me regret that.
[85:32.60]Make me regret that.
[85:33.86]Is that bad?
[85:34.49]Alright.
[85:36.16]And you're aggressive.
[85:37.04]This person needed to go.
[85:43.31]Need to upgrade your inspection thing?
[85:45.89]Wait.
[85:55.31]Alerts if metal is detected in baggage.
[86:01.61]Should I do that one?
[86:06.18]Alerts of gunpowder is detected in baggage.
[86:08.73]This is so much money!
[86:09.71]Upgrade the tools.
[86:20.03]Okay.
[86:22.00]Add sound cues for thermal and pulse measurements.
[86:26.60]Adds orange and red indicators for high and extreme values.
[86:30.55]I mean, I don't need that.
[86:32.36]I can read that.
[86:35.05]Scanner detection radius.
[86:39.05]Can see through blood and mud.
[86:40.70]Oh my god.
[86:41.70]Oh my god!
[86:43.33]Lady!
[86:53.50]Lady?
[86:54.96]Where'd she go?
[86:56.19]No, wait!
[86:57.12]She's in here.
[87:07.74]Identification verified.
[87:10.23]Come here.
[87:11.32]Please.
[87:13.15]I...
[87:13.97]I...
[87:16.85]That's not a bite.
[87:18.08]Okay.
[87:18.56]I thought it was going to be a bite right there.
[87:21.10]Alright.
[87:21.56]You're fine.
[87:21.87]Go back.
[87:25.27]I'll do anything.
[87:26.32]Just test me again.
[87:27.20]Alright.
[87:28.77]What about should I do something to upgrade?
[87:30.70]Somebody said radius.
[87:34.21]I guess it makes it easier just to kind of...
[87:35.69]Okay.
[87:36.66]Move it.
[87:41.17]What?
[87:56.56]Okay, I think you're fine, but your eyes are fine.
[87:59.71]I don't like the sneezing though.
[88:07.10]Whoa.
[88:08.31]Whoa, oh.
[88:20.77]This guy's dead, sorry.
[88:28.43]Wait, he was green?
[88:29.66]No, he wasn't.
[88:30.36]Okay.
[88:41.46]OK, clean.
[88:44.50]Oh wait.
[88:47.26]No.
[88:48.75]OK.
[88:59.77]That was too many bullets for an execution.
[89:02.96]Was it?
[89:08.21]Hmm?
[89:09.56]No, you're okay.
[89:12.37]You're just good.
[89:13.44]Come on in.
[89:17.19]Uh, goodbye.
[89:34.74]Weird.
[89:37.03]Why would you have a normal temperature?
[89:39.98]A normal pulse.
[89:41.27]Normal reflexes.
[89:45.57]No bites, right?
[89:46.63]I mean, you're infected, right?
[89:51.41]Ah.
[89:53.04]Ah, it's not good.
[89:55.80]See ya.
[89:59.71]That's not good.
[90:10.22]Alright, I gotta clear this out tomorrow.
[90:19.96]What is in here?
[90:20.50]A little workshop?
[90:24.47]Okay.
[90:25.16]Good night.
[90:27.99]What could be worse is infecting an entire population.
[90:30.28]Yeah.
[90:35.47]Okay.
[90:38.54]I'm in the red.
[90:39.26]$2,400 in profit and 2,500 expenditures?
[90:49.15]Negative $100.
[90:50.20]What?
[90:54.49]Uh, new directives are now available.
[90:57.32]Check the bulletin board immediately.
[91:07.62]Okay.
[91:09.66]Uh, the Major and Georgie have tasks and requests that require your attention.
[91:13.40]So they leave you like little quests.
[91:15.47]Time limit.
[91:18.79]Alright.
[91:20.05]We have intel on a man named Solomon who claims he survived three infections.
[91:25.23]but our records list him as dead for five years.
[91:28.04]If he shows up, send him straight to quarantine.
[91:32.26]Okay, Solomon goes right to quarantine no matter what.
[91:37.48]Okay.
[91:39.54]Wait.
[91:41.79]Oh, what the fuck, dude?
[91:47.12]Are they alright?
[91:51.69]Come on!
[91:55.69]Well, actually that freed... That's so loud!
[91:58.39]That freed up space.
[92:00.91]Whatever.
[92:03.30]Okay, let's go.
[92:19.99]Bite?
[92:20.31]No.
[92:22.36]No.
[92:25.09]You look alright.
[92:26.27]Anything you hide?
[92:26.83]Anything?
[92:37.49]Alright dude, good luck.
[92:41.90]Dinner's at 8.
[92:43.99]Hey.
[92:55.50]Survivors have carried luggage which may contain contraband.
[92:59.75]Personal items and food are permitted.
[93:01.58]Weapons are not.
[93:03.55]Earn rewards for confiscating contraband.
[93:05.63]Alright, so food...
[93:07.46]Alright.
[93:08.63]Zombie parts are a biohazard.
[93:11.56]Anyone carrying them must be treated as infected.
[93:16.32]Alright, this looks fine.
[93:25.42]Some harmless he's got a machine gun whole arsenal can't let that into the camp that spell disaster Please it's all I have left
[93:34.01]You can't bring a flamethrower into the area.
[93:37.82]And what is this?
[93:39.97]Knife?
[93:47.93]Sardines.
[93:48.84]Alright, you two fishes.
[93:50.91]This is weirder than I think having the gun.
[93:54.54]In a zombie apocalypse scenario, I think carrying these is weirder than having a flamethrower.
[94:05.83]Alright.
[94:15.57]I gotta get a good technique here.
[94:18.21]I think the technique is just go one, two, well that's too fast.
[94:32.21]Okay, but if they have contraband, should I let them in?
[94:34.52]Alright, I guess you're fine.
[94:45.32]What's the point?
[94:48.78]Can we hurry this up?
[94:54.52]I have a stream to get to.
[94:56.91]Stream?

[99:03.79]Oh, that's ammo.
[99:05.39]I need that.
[99:06.29]It's my medicine.
[99:07.91]Alright, something's wrong with this guy.
[99:13.53]It's a big red bruise, first of all.

[101:03.62]Okay, so you...
[101:04.56]I think you're fine.
[101:11.13]Mmm, I think you're fine.
[101:13.55]She fine?
[101:27.59]I think she's alright.
[101:29.00]Yellow, that doesn't mean she needs to be quarantined.
[101:30.87]Yeah, she's fine.
[101:32.34]Go on.
[101:38.29]Don't make me wait.
[101:49.95]You're good?
[101:51.25]Okay.
[101:51.78]Uh, you got the freckles, though.
[101:53.01]What about a bite?
[102:05.72]Nope, you're good.
[102:08.44]Anything else I can do for you?
[102:10.52]Are you just good?
[102:11.11]This is the first person I think that is just good.
[102:15.04]Besides the freckles?
[102:19.00]Oh shit!
[102:20.02]Okay, what do I need to do with you?
[102:24.08]Send this person to quarantine.
[102:27.45]Okay.
[102:29.86]There's nobody infected in there, right?
[102:39.51]Oh god, this guy's gonna get eaten.
[102:45.09]Alright, well, we're good.
[102:46.50]Uh, how am I doing on my base?
[102:50.32]Got plenty of food.
[102:51.90]How much money do I got?
[102:52.69]Okay, I got eight grand.
[102:54.44]Let's do some upgrades.
[103:06.05]I don't need that.
[103:07.50]What about the quarantine for sure?
[103:09.90]Shit, I need more.
[103:11.43]I gotta get to level three.
[103:14.76]A containment unit for infected subjects do not allow power to fail.
[103:21.97]You can research new symptoms.
[103:23.44]$40,000.
[103:25.38]What?
[103:39.89]Okay, that's eight pieces of food a day.
[103:44.58]Uh, balance output and fuel efficiency, the work horse.
[103:49.17]Alright.
[103:49.43]What about resupply?
[103:50.25]I need way more than that.
[103:53.34]Just max it out.
[103:59.77]Okay, I need more research points.
[104:01.09]Okay, the next time I do an evacuation, I'm doing a ton of research points.
[104:13.64]I got 147.
[104:15.20]I need 300 research points.
[104:19.38]What about the security tower?
[104:20.42]Hold on.
[104:30.31]Automated defense post that eliminates infected...
[104:32.78]Okay, so this is an automatic firing unit thing?
[104:36.86]I'm doing good on power, right?
[104:42.12]Okay, I need money.
[104:46.93]Get the thermostat colors.
[104:48.82]I'll get that next.
[104:52.01]Alright, let's go.
[104:53.42]Perfect.
[104:54.66]Hooray.
[105:00.36]Check the temperature on that rat.
[105:05.12]When are we going to submit You Laugh, You Lose clips?
[105:07.60]Hold on.
[105:10.61]Uh, we actually can probably put that in chat now, right?
[105:14.42]There's going to be a forum.
[105:23.95]Okay, I have one bomb.
[105:29.11]Also, because I haven't been streaming a lot, like I was supposed to stream like three or four days ago.
[105:34.57]If there needs to be a little bit more time for that stream, and I'm talking like a few days, then I'm going to make sure it has the time it needs.
[105:43.32]That was loud.
[105:48.07]The plan is to do the clay figure stream and the you laugh, you lose stream on the same day.
[105:55.31]Because, I mean, I guess, oh, I'm going to do a you laugh, you lose.
[105:59.97]After that, or before that, maybe we would do the clay thing and just make it like a whole thing.
[106:20.11]Hurry.
[106:26.59]Come on.
[106:26.77]Alright, everything's loaded.
[106:37.23]Alright, this segment's gonna get way harder, I think.
[106:56.11]Dude, that's cool.
[106:57.68]Alright, so I can reload that?
[107:03.06]Oops.
[107:14.71]So I said, fuck this game, why?
[107:16.33]Why are you saying that?
[107:30.82]The soldiers say some jackass wrote dirty poems on the camp walls.
[107:35.15]Find out who they're talking about,
[107:38.82]Wait, no is it all?
[107:40.08]Starts every fight.
[107:41.75]Find all the poems using the flashlight.
[107:47.74]Okay.
[107:51.19]Why that bloody footprint?
[108:06.43]I hear somebody going, wait.
[108:11.84]No, you're fine.
[108:22.48]Alright, well, it's a chill day.
[108:24.84]Everyone relax.
[108:30.41]Someone intentionally let zombies into their last save zone.
[108:34.04]He was beaten severely before escaping.
[108:36.29]We believe he will attempt to gain access to this base.
[108:38.43]Do not let him.
[108:40.51]What?
[108:46.52]Okay, so somebody is going to be covered in a bunch of bruises?
[108:57.04]Should I find the graffiti too?
[109:01.96]Wait, we gotta check on the quarantine.
[109:04.49]That's new.
[109:05.96]That symptom's not in our database.
[109:08.54]Fresh mutation.
[109:09.97]Deja vu.
[109:11.56]Ugh, pandemics never change.
[109:14.91]Exciting!
[109:15.96]Time to add it to the symptom chart.
[109:19.43]Okay.
[109:21.23]I gotta check this.
[109:22.39]I can't go in here.
[109:37.33]Hmm.
[109:41.80]Looking for a bite.
[109:46.87]I don't see a bite.
[109:48.79]I don't see a bite.
[109:50.98]OK, what about you?
[109:52.91]Yep.
[109:54.03]So what does that mean?
[109:55.24]Tap the right symptom on the list.
[109:57.82]Oh.
[109:58.90]Unknown symptom.
[110:02.74]Oh shit.
[110:06.46]Alright, so get him to the lab.
[110:14.76]the poor guy won't make it through the procedure he's gonna die sorry you saw him right
[110:21.39]A light breeze would knock him over.
[110:23.30]This way, his sacrifice will actually help keep others alive somehow.
[110:32.19]Are you okay?
[110:34.48]Identification verified.
[110:36.67]Quarantine status stable.
[110:39.23]How you doing?
[110:40.14]Come out here.
[110:44.50]What were you doing in here in the first place?
[110:47.03]Why did I put him in here?
[110:55.58]What's he doing in here?
[111:01.61]Oh, you...
[111:03.05]Wait, but did I complete that quest?
[111:06.30]Can I just send him to the...
[111:07.31]I can just send him to the block, right?
[111:19.78]Because I want the room.
[111:20.87]How you doing?
[111:28.61]You got that bruise.
[111:37.26]You haven't done anything in a day, though.
[111:38.51]One more day?
[111:40.88]Alright, I'm gonna leave you in here one more day.
[111:50.58]Alright, come on in.
[111:53.52]Wait, I have to go to the lab.
[112:08.09]extract the target organ highlighted green, destroy the organs highlighted yellow, and that are blocking the way to the target organ.
[112:16.89]Don't destroy organs highlighted in red.
[112:23.57]Excuse me?
[112:39.23]Okay, so, okay, laser is destroy.
[112:41.45]Extract the organ within the set time.
[112:43.00]Oh my god, I have one second.
[112:51.73]That guy's dead.
[113:00.76]Alright, we'll get the sample.
[113:15.93]Jesus.
[113:25.01]Okay, symptom found.
[113:27.16]Added to the symptom chart.
[113:29.59]So skin rash can turn into necrosis.
[113:41.08]That's not good.
[113:51.40]That guy might have been fine.
[113:52.49]I don't think so, man.
[113:56.78]Alright, come on.
[114:01.53]Double bloody nose.
[114:13.44]Is this the guy that got beat up?
[114:24.26]That's some bad bruising.
[114:30.81]Okay, bad bruising...
[114:35.21]That's alright.
[114:35.97]What about your head?
[114:36.62]That looks like necrosis.
[114:49.98]How do you crouch?
[114:53.72]Where was it?
[115:02.43]Hmm.
[115:04.30]Is that enough to send somebody off?
[115:07.13]No skin rash.
[115:11.34]Dude, that is kinda gnarly.
[115:13.07]Alright, alright.
[115:20.14]Anything else on you?
[115:25.82]Is that necrosis?
[115:27.18]I guess it is.
[115:27.97]Alright.
[115:28.61]See you later.
[115:29.01]Goodbye.
[115:39.34]You can trust me.
[115:43.70]I'm healthy.
[115:44.62]Dude, you've got a lot wrong, actually.
[115:47.49]Okay, so you've got green skin... ...covered in necrosis...
[115:55.62]Red eyes.
[115:56.68]What do you get in the bag?
[116:04.90]That's a great looking cheeseburger though, alright.
[116:10.78]Um, you can keep the garlic.
[116:15.04]Alright, well you're dead.
[116:17.69]There's everything wrong with you.
[116:19.08]Red eyes.
[116:23.23]Green skin.
[116:24.35]Bruises.
[116:27.20]Red bruise.
[116:28.14]Necrosis.
[116:28.78]You've got every single thing wrong with you.
[116:31.03]How's your temperature?
[116:43.17]Bad.
[116:52.69]Alright, goodbye.
[116:58.79]That's a cool backpack though.
[117:02.39]I like that bright blue backpack.
[117:06.53]Maybe she had a green bath bomb yesterday.
[117:09.11]You guys remember when I...
[117:11.64]I canceled a stream because I said my skin was turning yellow and I was like, this is bad.
[117:17.07]That means something horrible.
[117:19.49]And then I realized that it was actually from a bath bomb.
[117:23.37]It was from a yellow bath bomb that I did the night before.
[117:27.34]and I ended up getting some of the powder I think on my hands and it just was so stained on my skin
[117:33.88]that I really thought I had like a pretty serious medical emergency.
[117:40.18]So I come into the offline pre-stream chat and I'm like, guys, I gotta go to the doctor.
[117:45.80]This is not fucking funny.
[117:47.39]This is fucked up.
[117:49.56]I think I came back like two or three hours later and turned the stream on.
[118:01.54]That's not good.
[118:04.98]Alright, well the pulse is too high.
[118:07.45]And the eyes.
[118:11.92]Does the pulse automatically mean that you're... dead?
[118:16.41]Yeah.
[118:18.88]You don't have a backpack.
[118:19.68]What about marks or anything?
[118:29.62]Sorry.
[118:33.56]See you.
[118:35.22]Am I in trouble?
[118:36.69]Don't make me wait.
[118:37.39]I thought I was safe.
[118:44.99]You have to believe me.
[118:48.65]Oh no, sorry dude.
[118:50.08]You're also probably dead.
[118:58.07]Bart Simpson?
[119:02.09]Is his name Bart?
[119:04.67]No, his name's Arthur.
[119:06.13]It's not Bart.
[119:10.80]Dude just had a couple of sandwiches and a yam.
[119:12.99]He's fine.
[119:14.94]Wow, I want that.
[119:16.25]I want to eat that so bad.
[119:19.72]Too bad.
[119:29.31]Wait.
[119:34.85]Yep.
[119:41.22]Was that too high?
[119:42.23]Hold on a second.
[119:47.95]Over 41?
[119:50.64]Yeah, you're dead.
[119:54.98]And does the yellow skin mean...
[119:57.59]Is that green skin?
[119:59.60]Is that technically green?
[120:10.38]Alright, well.
[120:13.74]I could send him to the lab.
[120:17.65]Let's do it.
[120:18.40]Yeah.
[120:19.32]I feel like that's different.
[120:26.41]He used a bath bomb last night and you're gonna kill him.
[120:28.70]Well, I didn't... My whole body wasn't...
[120:31.37]Okay.
[120:32.71]It was a very concentrated area on my arms and on my legs.
[120:45.75]Alright, let's take a look.
[120:55.88]Alright, we gotta get through that.
[120:56.78]One of the lungs?
[121:07.30]That's not even what I was testing.
[121:18.39]What do we got?
[121:25.44]What?
[121:25.66]Does that cost money?
[121:29.78]Alright, now do me next.
[121:39.52]Alright, just had to take a leak.
[121:44.54]I was helping others out there.
[121:46.04]Look, no bites.
[121:48.34]Ooh, necrosis on the neck, red eyes.
[122:03.09]You got a lot wrong with you, man.
[122:14.55]Alright.
[122:17.24]No, that's not accurate.
[122:20.27]Necrosis.
[122:22.60]Uh, green skin, red eyes, and there you go.
[122:30.84]Goodbye.
[122:33.84]You have to mark it as an unknown symptom.
[122:39.44]Oh, fuck.
[122:45.36]Is this the guy that got beat up because he's doing that face?
[122:52.59]This guy is emoting a lot differently than everybody else is.
[122:59.11]What does it say about this guy?
[123:02.40]Okay, bruises.
[123:09.90]Do not let them in, eliminate the target.
[123:25.17]I need to mark the symptom.
[123:37.18]Okay, I don't think I eliminated him.
[123:48.59]Oh, fuck, that head.
[123:50.09]Hit him in the back of the head?
[124:04.52]Well, see ya.
[124:12.22]Take his brain out?
[124:16.32]Okay, did I win?
[124:21.86]Ayy.
[124:22.56]Alright, how are you doing?
[124:25.00]Okay.
[124:26.63]I'll check you tomorrow.
[124:35.23]Go look for the graffiti.
[124:37.85]Alright, we'll do graffiti check right now.
[124:40.15]And then I'm going to go.
[124:40.92]I got to pee.
[124:42.02]I'm going to grab a snack and I'll be right back.
[124:46.56]There's no more graffiti here.
[124:49.86]What about this way?
[125:02.64]Graffiti?
[125:16.51]I'll get the flashlight on.
[125:18.43]It's on.
[125:36.95]Don't see any graffiti.
[125:54.21]How's your will to live today?
[125:55.58]It's pretty high.
[125:56.89]That's pretty high, I'd say.
[126:14.70]What are you doing?
[126:18.91]What are you doing?
[126:19.49]Why are you doing that?
[126:25.87]I don't see any graffiti in the area.
[126:29.84]What the heck?
[126:32.29]Do you have to follow the footprints?
[126:37.87]I saw that you said that you listened to the Fullmetal Alchemist OST before.
[126:45.99]Yeah, it's been a long time.
[126:52.75]Alright, I'm gonna take a break.
[126:56.40]I could follow that, but I'm not going to yet.
[127:04.24]The footprints are a red herring, just ignore them?
[127:10.71]Alright, BRB.
[127:13.64]There we go.
[127:14.22]That's the money.
[127:17.05]Don't play possum, soldier.
[127:18.76]I know you're up.
[127:20.06]There's a new symptom.
[127:21.63]Go see Georgie.
[127:22.73]He'll brief you.
[127:24.10]Alright, be right back.
[133:17.47]Hello.
[133:20.22]Another two or three minutes.
[133:22.86]Just helping out Otto.
[133:25.30]He needs a little extra time.
[133:27.85]Uh, maybe like three minutes.
[133:29.20]Be right back again.
[142:30.54]Hello.
[142:31.85]I'm back.
[142:34.91]Somebody said, I feel bad for this person.
[142:36.40]They said,
[142:38.51]And the only time I could watch this stream for about 15 minutes has been a silent BRB screen.
[142:46.45]I'm so sorry.
[142:53.61]Did you get stuck?
[142:56.63]Uh, no.
[142:59.74]I'm good.
[143:00.11]I'm good now.
[143:10.06]I had to do like a 12-minute piss.
[143:21.13]Okay.
[143:22.20]Uh, probably gonna play this for like another 30-40 minutes, and then we'll move to Withering Rooms finale.
[143:32.90]This game is fun, though.
[143:33.62]I like this game a lot.
[143:36.97]Hey, buddy.
[143:38.36]You're looking kind of rough.
[143:40.08]Didn't sleep, huh?
[143:41.89]I can't blame you.
[143:43.40]I've pretty much forgotten what a good night's sleep feels like myself.
[143:46.87]I keep waking up like I can't catch my breath.
[143:49.94]Turns out you can spot the infection the same way.
[143:52.83]Breathing?
[143:54.10]Listen closely to how a person breathes and you'll figure out quick if they're sick.
[143:59.78]Well, get out of the way.
[144:09.53]The virus can cause respiratory problems.
[144:11.36]Use the stethoscope to check a survivor's breathing for any irregularities.
[144:16.65]High amplitude waves are a telltale sign of infection.
[144:23.05]If no signs of illness or infection are detected, the black zone will disappear.
[144:29.96]Okay, so it just kind of goes crazy.
[144:35.13]And the lungs show spots.
[144:38.30]Okay.
[144:38.72]Are we bolt and board?
[144:43.64]If someone carries a police baton, do not confiscate it.
[144:48.44]Okay.
[144:52.07]So don't confiscate a police baton.
[144:54.48]Move it.
[144:59.45]Please.
[145:04.04]Is that bad?
[145:08.62]No, that's normal.
[145:27.87]You can check it from behind as well?
[145:29.67]Really?
[145:35.57]Uh oh.
[145:39.71]That's not good.
[145:40.48]He's got a bad spot right there.
[145:42.65]Alright.
[145:45.36]Your eyes are fine, but you got those...
[145:48.55]Where is it now?
[145:49.50]Okay.
[145:54.30]Uh, sickly breath.
[146:01.03]So, wait, should I send him to the, uh, lab?
[146:12.84]That's a little more wheezy
[146:23.74]No, that's the right one.
[146:25.95]I think you're fine.
[146:30.14]Alright, goodbye.
[146:33.48]Don't make me wait.
[146:38.53]Are your eyes good?
[146:40.64]I just need to join them.
[146:45.74]Bruise.
[146:50.56]Stop.
[146:53.57]Infected.
[147:03.11]Infected, bruising, and the bad thing.
[147:14.14]Whoa!
[147:15.01]What the fuck is that?
[147:16.01]This guy's part werewolf.
[147:22.53]I gotta send you to the lab, dude.
[147:25.62]I gotta send you to the lab, dude.
[147:27.37]Sorry.
[147:29.30]How do I say I want to check him in the laboratory?
[147:52.32]That was a poor inspection?
[147:53.46]Why?
[147:53.74]Isn't going to the laboratory a massive inspection?
[148:00.31]It's inspection 2.0.
[148:04.50]Alright, how do I select... How do I select what I'm looking for?
[148:13.14]Don't I have to actually select the illness?
[148:24.88]No, you don't.
[148:25.43]You just have to get the green thing.
[148:26.75]Okay.
[148:31.20]Yep, his throat.
[148:33.09]How do I go up?
[148:36.63]Got it.
[148:39.73]That's brutal.
[148:41.77]Oh.
[148:45.94]You do that in the inspection part.
[148:54.31]There we go.
[148:55.08]Infected breath.
[149:01.96]It sounds like shy stuff.
[149:07.80]Cool.
[149:19.64]Send in the next person.
[149:25.06]Oh, I want to get... You look kind of normal.
[149:29.38]I mean, hold on.
[149:31.63]239 points?
[149:38.44]I think it'll go faster if I do that.
[149:48.72]This doesn't go faster.
[149:49.73]Wait, it was rising.
[150:02.05]Oh no!
[150:03.42]Whoever that guy was!
[150:04.79]The streamer!
[150:25.37]Clear lungs?
[150:31.54]I thought that was a bite.
[150:32.36]No.
[150:41.93]You look kind of clear.
[150:42.75]You look clear.
[150:44.80]Anything else?
[150:47.55]Look at me.
[150:51.24]I think he's fine.
[150:54.72]Yeah, this is the healthiest guy so far.
[151:01.28]Alright, police baton?
[151:02.98]No.
[151:03.61]Are we allowed to have alcohol?
[151:13.80]Is this a dry community?
[151:29.72]Temperature's a little high.
[151:36.70]Hm?
[151:39.07]That's sick.
[151:41.26]Yeah!
[151:53.04]Well, we know you're dead, so...
[151:56.50]Your eyes are fine, but everything else is not.
[152:03.53]High temperature.
[152:04.30]You had both of these.
[152:06.83]You had a backpack and... Let's check this.
[152:14.62]Fine.
[152:22.23]Alright.
[152:22.61]Go die.
[152:23.63]This feels...
[152:24.54]Competent inspection.
[152:26.07]Did I miss something?
[152:37.49]Good.
[152:38.97]Nothing.
[152:39.47]This guy seems pretty healthy.
[152:45.36]You hide to bite?
[152:52.42]Hmm?
[152:55.48]I think you're good.
[152:59.88]You good?
[153:10.26]You can't be perfect, right?
[153:12.77]I think he's perfect.
[153:14.35]I don't see any issues at all.
[153:16.58]I can't believe it.
[153:17.96]Thank you.
[153:22.42]Uh oh.
[153:24.33]That's new, whatever that is.
[153:28.63]What is that?
[153:41.26]We gotta send you to the lab.
[153:48.73]You fine?
[153:51.20]You fine?
[153:51.75]Okay, well, what is that?
[153:56.19]That's not a skin rash.
[153:57.88]That's something worse, right?
[154:00.62]That's new.
[154:04.21]Yeah, that's way worse than a skin rash.
[154:05.92]That thing is all red.
[154:08.03]Look at that.
[154:08.55]Is that the same thing?
[154:10.74]No, that's different.
[154:15.50]I don't know what it is, but you're going to the laptop.
[154:21.59]Pale skin on... oh shit.
[154:24.86]Core inspection!
[154:27.45]Is that pale?
[154:28.52]You don't look pale.
[154:44.40]Let's find out.
[155:05.65]Okay.
[155:10.15]There's the liver.
[155:20.89]Why am I taking the liver out if it's a skin problem?
[155:23.55]Is it actually just a rash?
[155:26.76]That looked more red and pus-filled than the rash.
[155:36.65]Whatever, let's go.
[155:42.07]My kids made it through yesterday.
[155:43.78]I just need to join them.
[155:49.30]Mm-hmm Mm-hmm
[155:57.13]Is that a rash?
[155:59.97]That's a rash.
[156:14.67]Okay, besides that rash, you're fine.
[156:18.19]Are those freckles?
[156:22.04]Are those freckles?
[156:24.03]No, that's a rash.
[156:25.11]Look.
[156:26.52]No, that's a rash.
[156:27.44]Those are not freckles, dude.
[156:37.35]Don't make me wait.
[156:39.33]Sir.
[156:49.35]Make sure you bring your Mario Kart wheel.
[156:58.24]Okay, rash.
[157:01.99]No bites.
[157:09.49]Oh, the Nintendo Labo is in the top 300, by the way.
[157:13.09]If you were wondering.
[157:14.68]But where is it?
[157:15.39]I don't know.
[157:16.03]We'll find out.
[157:24.56]Okay, you're sick, but I'd quarantine.
[157:31.08]Pulse is high.
[157:33.34]You got a skin rash.
[157:38.03]You got the... not the conjunctivitis.
[157:41.56]Yeah.
[157:47.65]What's the point of all this?
[157:54.40]We're all dead already.
[157:59.41]true you are in a quarantine zone stay calm and wait for your turn remove your outer clothing hats
[158:08.46]Okay.
[158:09.62]How do your lungs sound?
[158:15.11]Whoa!
[158:16.03]Okay, aggressive.
[158:27.95]aggressive?
[158:28.71]sick?
[158:34.14]Okay, you're aggressive, you're sick, and your eyes are all messed up.
[158:38.12]Got it.
[158:39.35]Quarantine.
[158:53.48]Okay, skin rash.
[159:02.69]Hiccups.
[159:10.20]What else you got?
[159:15.89]Alright, skin rash, hiccups, and you are fine in every other category.
[159:21.11]No, you... Oh, you're dead.
[159:25.21]Sorry.
[159:36.04]I did it.
[159:45.52]Alright, how's the base looking right now?
[159:49.07]Everything seems to be fine.
[159:53.96]I love how this generates food.
[159:58.01]I gotta go to tier 3.
[160:03.44]Fuck.
[160:04.00]Okay.
[160:04.88]I'll get it tomorrow.
[160:15.36]He's laughing at them, he's killing them, and he's laughing at them.
[160:18.45]When did I laugh?
[160:19.36]I didn't laugh at anybody.
[160:22.39]I went...
[160:28.35]10 grand.
[160:34.39]Okay.
[160:35.19]Alright, this is the last egg.
[160:53.98]Attention, evacuation convoy arriving today.
[160:57.41]Somebody is hiding infected tissue inside a candy bar.
[161:01.63]Confiscate the candy bar.
[161:05.47]Alright, now what?
[161:09.45]Send it to the cage?
[161:16.39]Okay.
[161:17.42]If you have a zombie in quarantine, send it to the cage located in the laboratory.
[161:21.40]Studying zombies is crucial for dealing a cure.
[161:23.33]You only have one zombie in the cage at a time.
[161:26.56]Tend to the zombie in the cage.
[161:27.95]Bring it food in the form of corpse zombies.
[161:32.42]The zombies can die of starvation.
[161:33.85]Can only eat one corpse a day.
[161:38.15]Oh, okay.
[161:39.14]And send them to the science division?
[161:49.55]I can't burn that?
[161:58.90]Did you do a CS:GO crate unboxing stream?
[162:03.10]I would rather... Actually, I don't know.
[162:06.17]Would I rather stream League of Legends for 100 straight hours or open, like, 500 CS:GO boxes?
[162:15.32]Uh...
[162:17.63]Probably the boxes.
[162:20.48]Well, you know what happens.
[162:23.11]When the dispatch comes in, load it onto the bus and forget about it.
[162:27.29]Let the eggheads deal with it from there.
[162:30.29]What do I feed it?
[162:38.45]Oh, I gotta feed it the dead bodies.
[162:46.32]You could get through 500 boxes quicker.
[162:57.74]Yeah, but do I want to open 500 CS:GO boxes?
[163:02.00]I do not.
[163:17.34]You left the cart?
[163:18.42]I did?
[163:18.92]What?
[163:24.24]Okay, that's more fair.
[163:27.22]That, yeah.
[163:28.11]So if I were to do...
[163:30.32]Hold on a second.
[163:31.04]What the fuck's going on here?
[163:32.99]What am I...
[163:33.29]Wait, wait.
[163:33.59]Let me pay attention.
[163:34.19]Hold on.
[163:38.19]Where- where are these bodies?
[163:44.18]Shit, you got me on that 500 small-sized duck versus one fucking horse-sized duck, and now I forgot everything I was doing.
[163:53.33]Where is this cart?
[164:01.43]Where are those bodies?
[164:02.38]The bodies is... Where are the bodies?
[164:06.12]I was on total autopilot.
[164:07.65]Alright, here we go.
[164:14.04]This is puke inducing.
[164:33.02]Oh, the turning is awful.
[164:34.89]I love the corpse from the cart.
[164:36.64]Trust me, you don't want to know what happens to that body next.
[164:40.25]Shake a leg.
[164:41.03]You've got work piling up.
[164:52.51]Oh, my God.
[164:55.55]This is... Oh, that's disgusting.
[165:11.87]I can't touch that cart anymore.
[165:13.00]I actually will throw up.
[165:19.46]Attention, evacuation convoy arriving today.
[165:22.40]Alright, evacuation time.
[165:25.13]Open the cage is a prank?
[165:26.38]Alright, somebody has a candy bar?
[165:29.20]Geez, dude.
[165:31.47]Whoa!
[165:34.09]That's a lot of money.
[165:39.37]Dude, you had an entire Resident Evil store.
[165:46.30]Do we confiscate the money?
[165:48.40]Take whatever.
[165:49.33]Just let me through.
[165:50.21]Alright, but that's fucking bullshit.
[165:51.68]I just got negative $100?
[165:52.68]There's at least 10 grand on the table.
[165:56.18]Why did I...
[165:57.06]I should have been 9900 positive.
[166:03.53]Bullshit.
[166:11.62]Okay, you're fine.
[166:15.02]I think.
[166:20.77]You are in a quarantine zone.
[166:23.10]Stay calm and wait for your turn.
[166:25.45]Okay.
[166:25.59]Remove your outer clothing.
[166:27.40]Pass.
[166:27.98]Okay.
[166:28.39]This guy's good.
[166:29.64]You did have a lot of bullshit though.
[166:46.30]I can multitask.
[166:47.60]Ah, no.
[166:54.31]Bruise?
[166:54.70]No.
[167:08.56]Cheese?
[167:09.22]Pumpkin?
[167:09.80]Wine?

[167:11.63]Oh, you're good.
[167:15.98]Okay, have fun.
[167:17.89]Wait, no you're not.
[167:19.23]What's going on with you?
[167:24.19]That said infected.
[167:30.97]Mmm, you're sick, but I think you're alright.
[167:36.71]Cuts?
[167:39.57]I think he's fine.
[167:47.77]Cuts and then what was the other thing you had?
[167:52.88]You had a cough.
[167:53.22]Don't cause any trouble.
[167:59.59]Poor inspection.
[168:00.43]What?
[168:00.83]What do you mean?
[168:05.02]What?
[168:05.32]Cut?
[168:05.65]Is quarantine is cuts?
[168:08.13]Are you serious?
[168:16.41]What do I do about this?
[168:21.11]Can I move him?
[168:24.49]Oh fuck, is he gonna infect everybody?
[168:26.66]How do I get him killed?
[168:37.94]Wait, it is evac day.
[168:39.30]Maybe he'll, okay, maybe he'll stay.
[168:40.87]I can send him.
[168:49.82]Attention, evacuation convoy arriving today.
[168:58.53]Okay, that doesn't sound good, but you're okay.
[169:05.90]Could be worse.
[169:11.90]Is that a bruise?
[169:14.00]No.
[169:21.82]Is that a skin rash?
[169:24.63]Skin rash.
[169:30.76]Prepare your belongings for inspection.
[169:40.90]You gotta go quarantine.
[169:42.93]Oh, fuck.
[169:43.35]Hold on.
[169:52.46]Alright, you gotta go hang out in there for a few minutes.
[169:57.51]Why am I killing people?
[169:58.43]I have not killed a single person.
[170:00.31]What about his bag?
[170:02.94]What do you mean his bag?
[170:06.57]Oh wait, he had a fucking backpack?
[170:09.49]Oh shit, this guy had a backpack!
[170:13.79]Uh-oh.
[170:14.28]Do I just fry him?
[170:16.57]I don't- I- do I just- what- what do I do?
[170:18.57]He- what does he- what if he has something bad in there?
[170:20.94]What if he's gonna infect everybody?
[170:25.93]That's a bat.
[170:27.91]Is that necrosis?
[170:37.52]Dude, you're throwing?
[170:38.59]I'm not.
[170:44.39]Moderate temperature.

[171:51.47]Okay, you might be alright.
[171:58.00]Skin rash?
[172:02.47]Uh-oh, that's a quarantine.
[172:08.62]And you did not react to this, but it's okay.
[172:10.67]But you still have to get quarantined.
[172:13.57]At least it's not a death sentence.
[172:15.88]What do you mean poor inspection?
[172:17.05]What did I do wrong?
[172:17.77]Wait, is there something else going on?
[172:25.05]This was just dirt?
[172:27.06]No, it wasn't dirt.
[172:28.18]That was a skin rash.
[172:37.55]This guy's got like a World War I rifle.
[172:44.75]Alright, you had weapons on you.

[174:13.87]Are these bots?
[174:14.67]Is this Blotchy Lungs?
[174:15.76]Should we test him?
[174:29.64]Hmm.

[182:25.80]Because I've been sitting on the last chapter of that game for the last month and a half.
[182:31.86]And I do want to complete it on stream.

[183:25.43]Alright, where's the guy that we have to send away?
[183:33.75]Somebody had to go into the science facility, right?
[183:38.09]Who is it?
[183:44.84]Does it show their name?
[183:46.46]Oh, right there.
[183:55.67]I don't know, bro.
[183:56.36]You should know.
[183:56.86]There's a lot of people that came through.
[184:01.88]Okay, this person is side quest related.
[184:06.04]Evacuating this survival will fail the side quest.
[184:08.61]Wait.
[184:12.02]Abe Crow needs to stick around?
[184:21.48]This guy has to stay in the base.
[184:26.70]Okay.
[184:32.31]Okay, what about Solomon?

[185:11.17]He might be infected.
[185:18.18]Just throw for content.
[185:19.36]I'm not throwing!
[185:21.11]Uh, I think he has to stay.
[185:22.40]This guy's not infected.
[185:34.24]The blonde guy before was infected?
[185:37.06]Was he actually?
[185:37.84]Oh shit.
[185:43.86]Uh, well, let's see what happens.
[185:48.21]Good luck to everybody.
[186:00.45]17,000 bucks.
[186:01.73]Are you kidding me?
[186:07.28]Damn, that's a lot.
[186:10.94]We're good?
[186:14.62]Hey, look at that.
[186:16.81]Perfect.
[186:24.61]Okay, so I can get it a jail-free card?
[186:32.66]Okay.
[186:43.88]Intel about a sadist who dissects people alive.
[186:47.02]We don't have a description, but he or she should be carrying their equipment.
[186:50.61]Find and terminate them.
[186:53.86]That's creepy, right?
[186:58.80]Use the syringe analyzer to extract fluid samples from a survivor to detect and determine an infection.
[187:05.20]You can only use it once.
[187:10.46]So that's what it is.
[187:12.33]An infection analyzer.
[187:14.14]Let me see.
[187:15.68]Give it here.
[187:16.81]Major told you about that incident?
[187:19.93]That tent caught fire on its own.
[187:22.62]Well, I just wasted that.
[187:25.47]Fuck.
[187:26.99]Okay, I'll just let you go on.
[187:36.18]do that?
[187:41.82]So the backpack
[187:44.53]Oh, a bunch of fucked up.
[187:45.99]These are fucking live kidneys.
[188:01.71]Is that his equipment?
[188:06.11]They're just CS:GO crates, are they?
[188:19.55]Fuck, I didn't- what are you doing?
[188:21.26]No, I- I thought it was gonna switch to this thing, and I-
[188:32.41]I thought I already wasted it.
[188:33.94]I... whatever.
[188:34.62]I think you're clean.
[188:42.03]No problems, no contraband.
[188:44.83]Get outta here.
[188:53.79]You are in a quarantine zone.
[188:55.96]I just need to get to the safe zone.
[188:57.40]My family is waiting for me.
[189:01.04]You're not going to confiscate the crates?
[189:03.20]You guys just said they were... See ya.
[189:05.78]See ya.
[189:06.04]I thought it was like a CS:GO reference.
[189:08.29]We saw that Dave, crazy Dave guy.
[189:10.92]I thought it was like, oh look, I had CS:GO crates.
[189:13.69]I thought you weren't, what?
[189:22.04]That was a one guy joke?
[189:25.09]I was going to confiscate them.
[189:26.68]Somebody said they're CS:GO crates.

[223:59.53]And then he aimed his gun at my face, so I was like, oh, fuck.
[224:08.53]Someone stole our ignitable lemons.
[224:13.17]One lemon is enough to burn the base pound.
[224:14.70]Don't let any lemons through.
[224:15.88]And eliminate the person that has a lemon?
[224:19.94]That's kind of fucked up.
[224:20.98]What if somebody just wants to make lemonade?
[224:23.07]You got yours too, huh?
[224:24.65]The Major's been on edge all day.
[224:26.98]Heard the guys had to shoot their own commander.
[224:28.91]I hope there's an aim down sight.
[224:38.90]Huh?
[225:04.05]What's with all the blood, man?
[225:05.43]You got a lot of blood.
[225:11.21]But you're okay.
[225:18.66]We got a raid from Limes.
[225:20.74]What's up, Limes?
[225:22.66]Thank you, Limes.
[225:24.95]We're playing the quarantine zombie simulation game.
[225:30.59]I think this guy's fine.
[225:33.48]Does blood matter?
[225:36.13]Welcome, Raiders.
[225:38.91]I think this guy's fine.
[225:45.02]What if something goes wrong?
[225:48.27]Am I wielding my power r-
[225:55.40]Should I shoot him?
[225:56.34]What do I do?
[225:56.86]What do I do?
[226:01.88]Having fun out there, huh?
[226:03.97]Hey, Georgetta.
[226:06.37]Should I have hit him with the hammer?
[226:08.53]Oh fuck.
[226:09.84]Should I have hit him with the hammer?
[226:16.36]I don't know, man!
[226:19.19]Okay, was it a zombie?
[226:29.47]Dude, you have the survival skills of a deer?
[226:31.15]What do you mean of a deer?
[226:39.90]A deer would have jumped up on all four of, like, prance, prance, prance, and jump away.
[226:51.39]What are you talking about?
[226:56.73]He hit you three times.
[226:57.90]I was gonna hit him in the head with the hammer.
[227:01.85]And then my screen started to turn red.
[227:05.11]So I was like, okay, well, I have to fucking, I think I have to kill this guy.
[227:08.64]Alright, if the organs appear intact and show no unusual coloring or damage...
[227:13.12]Okay.
[227:13.92]If you notice abnormalities such as lesions...
[227:20.23]I mean, it just kind of looks blue.
[227:22.77]Okay, if their insides look like cotton candy, they're infected.
[227:32.65]What?
[227:47.16]I'm going to kill somebody because this looks like this.
[227:52.83]I'm going to shoot somebody in the fucking head because I think I'm scanning their head temperature.
[228:02.10]Alright, stand still.
[228:08.07]What am I even looking for?
[228:09.14]This looks normal, right?
[228:24.67]I think you're fine.
[228:25.34]I thought that was the temperature tool.
[228:28.44]It's gonna happen, whatever.
[228:33.31]OK, I think you're fine, right?
[228:37.07]I don't see anything.
[228:38.98]Temperature.
[228:42.61]Why would they give me that device?
[228:49.04]Right?
[228:51.08]I feel like they wouldn't, this is tutorial for that device.
[229:10.19]I mean, looks kind of normal to me.
[229:12.33]Good luck.
[229:14.94]Wait, internal bleeding?
[229:17.35]Possibly?
[229:17.87]I don't know.
[229:18.75]Just go hang out.
[229:19.86]Zombies can't get in here, right?
[229:22.62]Right?
[229:31.03]What's the point of all this?
[229:32.95]We're all dead already.
[229:40.97]You look fine.
[229:43.82]What's this?
[229:50.30]Ah, this is the lemon person, right?
[229:52.05]It's just... What does it say?
[230:04.34]What are you talking about?
[230:05.43]What?
[230:06.88]Should I... is it eliminate?
[230:18.97]Come on!
[230:28.94]My kids made it through yesterday...
[230:31.06]...I just need to join them.
[230:35.96]Why you got blood all- is there blood all over your mouth?
[230:38.57]What have you been eating?
[230:53.14]Is that a new symptom?
[230:58.01]Whoa!
[231:00.85]Alright, well, that's that.
[231:03.42]Let's take a scan here.
[231:06.62]Dude, your heart is cotton candy.
[231:08.89]That's a cotton candy heart.
[231:09.91]And you also have blood in your mouth.
[231:13.35]And that's a cotton candy brain as well.
[231:15.96]This dude is fucked.
[231:21.15]Uh, laboratory.
[231:39.68]Cringe.
[231:40.97]Get lost.
[231:46.87]Don't you dare take my shit!
[231:48.56]You got like a thousand kilograms of cocaine, dude.
[231:55.09]And a PC.
[231:56.27]Dude, what kind of PC is this?
[231:58.32]68,000?
[232:06.60]Bruising.
[232:12.54]Bite.
[232:14.10]Bruising, bite, and aggression.
[232:19.00]And pale.
[232:22.18]Bruising.
[232:23.03]Bite.
[232:23.75]Aggression.
[232:29.29]You didn't have a weapon.
[232:29.96]You had contraband.
[232:31.35]Bruising, bite.
[232:33.84]It really is a sign.
[232:40.97]We are in a quarantine zone.
[232:43.00]Stay calm and wait for your turn.
[232:44.79]You better sleep with one eye open.
[232:59.20]I was gonna start doing this and be like a dare for that person to laugh, that one guy, but whatever.
[233:08.83]Do you see how fucked up you are?
[233:18.62]Oh.
[233:29.66]That's a high temperature.
[233:32.93]Yellow temperature.
[233:36.69]And.
[233:39.00]Uh.
[233:41.74]Your internal organs seem to be fine.
[233:46.85]I shot you in the shoulder and it would have been bad.
[233:49.35]Alright, so you have moderate temp,
[233:56.67]Uh-oh.
[233:58.12]Monster breath.
[233:59.68]Alright, moderate temp, monster breath, red eyes.
[234:02.01]No, stay right there.
[234:13.28]What happened to that animal guy?
[234:29.33]Got it.
[234:30.76]It's gonna be some kind of intestinal problem.
[234:44.11]Moldy Organ.
[234:47.13]Okay.
[234:49.29]Good to know.
[234:58.45]I'm back.
[235:01.97]Okay, so what kind of problems do you have?
[235:03.87]You have moderate temp.
[235:07.40]Bloody mouth.
[235:08.47]Should I do the bloody mouth too?
[235:09.84]Yeah, you got to go to the lab as well.
[235:18.10]See ya.
[235:26.55]Oops.
[235:40.62]You are in a quarantine zone.
[235:43.01]Stay calm and wait for your turn.
[235:44.86]Remove your outer clothing.
[235:52.15]I'm just trying to help you.
[235:54.88]I'm just trying to help you.
[235:56.89]Your temperature is awful, man.
[236:03.15]Aggressive and you're dead!
[236:15.94]You've got... What's all over you?
[236:17.98]Freckles, I think?
[236:22.81]And... Oh, whatever.
[236:24.78]He's gonna get liquidated anyways.
[236:26.36]I knew he was gonna do that!
[236:36.75]Don't make me wait.
[236:41.99]Checking.
[236:42.89]There's nothing valuable left.
[236:48.49]Skin rash.
[236:53.01]Breezing?
[236:54.80]Hmm?
[236:55.74]Maybe?
[236:57.51]That's a, oh, that's a bad, that's bad skin rush.
[237:01.35]Oh.
[237:03.65]Skin rash and red bruising.
[237:06.21]How the eyes look?
[237:08.02]They look fine.
[237:14.79]Hmm.
[237:18.40]What about this?
[237:23.35]You look alright.
[237:29.79]Okay.
[237:30.33]Skin rash and bad bruising.
[237:32.25]It's going to have to get you sent to the quarantine.
[237:44.49]Who's in quarantine right now?
[237:48.81]You alright?
[237:50.79]Dude, actually, you've been in here for a- Are you good?
[237:54.53]This guy's fine.
[237:56.16]Right?
[237:57.54]Come on out.
[237:58.00]Let me take a look at you.
[238:01.85]What are you doing?
[238:02.93]Is this really necessary?
[238:13.78]I think this guy's fine.
[238:14.59]We already got the mission for this guy, didn't we?
[238:23.10]So I can send him to the...
[238:27.25]This is the ant guy, but I can send...
[238:30.41]He's fine, right?
[238:34.30]I won't let you down.
[238:35.65]I promise.
[238:37.95]You've been in here for one day.
[238:39.12]What about you in the back?
[238:42.57]Let's take a look.
[238:43.57]Why not?
[238:47.21]You actually look a little better.
[239:04.15]Okay.
[239:04.37]I think she's good.
[239:17.43]Okay.
[239:18.13]Alright, alright.
[239:19.21]She's good.
[239:24.94]It's a little flush still, but no more rash, which is good.
[239:28.69]Alright.
[239:32.38]Be careful.
[239:34.76]Thank you so much.
[239:35.51]You still have the bad eyes.
[239:36.85]You just were put in here.
[239:39.47]Yeah.
[239:40.33]I wish I could do that too.
[239:43.67]I'd give anything and everything to wake up from this nightmare
[239:51.88]Uh, we're gonna have to send you- Wait!
[239:53.22]Speaking of the lab.
[240:10.35]the tracheal problem.
[240:34.99]Get it!
[240:40.29]Excuse me?
[240:41.01]What is...
[240:47.87]Oh fuck off, I didn't-
[240:59.31]That was a weird one.
[241:00.11]Yeah, I had to destroy every organ apparently.
[241:10.95]Mouth bleeding.
[241:11.90]Yuck.
[241:21.58]Alright, what's up?
[241:24.21]How you doing?
[241:27.17]You're okay.
[241:29.87]Yeah, you're definitely quarantined, but...
[241:40.38]Yeah, quarantine.
[241:42.35]Quarantine.
[241:43.04]That's a moderate monster breathing.
[241:48.58]Moderate monster breeding.
[241:54.54]I don't know why that was in there.
[241:58.88]Monster breathing.
[242:00.46]Alright, your pulse is moderate.
[242:15.53]Let's go like this.
[242:22.52]Where's the mouth bleeding?
[242:26.97]Yeah, it's because I combined bleeding and breathing.
[242:37.67]okay I have a shitload of points
[242:51.95]You want to play Monster Rancher real bad?
[242:56.41]Oh, maybe.
[242:58.83]I don't know.
[242:59.12]Ah, okay.
[242:59.36]Nothing else is wrong with you.
[243:00.34]I almost shot her.
[243:03.41]Alright.
[243:06.10]Uh, your eyes are fine.
[243:09.21]Is this... that's just dirt, right?
[243:13.78]Alright, where's Pale Skin?
[243:27.32]Oh shit, I didn't do this.
[243:29.26]Come back at her.
[243:30.67]Get out.
[243:35.42]I was too afraid of shooting her that I didn't do this.
[243:37.23]Okay, well, it was moderate anyways, it's fine.
[243:44.72]At least it's not a death sentence.
[243:48.83]Come on!
[243:55.82]It's a lot of shit.
[244:01.61]Thanks for reminding me.
[244:17.39]Okay, mouth breathing.
[244:19.01]Mouth bleeding.
[244:22.37]I can't, I'm having trouble with that fucking word today.
[244:35.59]Okay.
[244:36.96]Aggressive.
[244:38.29]Yellow eyes.
[244:39.06]Are you pale?
[244:43.02]Is that organ supposed to be purple?
[244:48.02]Is it red or purple?
[244:49.30]I think it's fine, right?
[244:58.27]Is it weird?
[244:58.80]I think it's fine.
[245:02.66]OK, aggressive.
[245:03.42]You are a mouth breather.
[245:08.25]And you have, is that pale skin?
[245:12.13]I'm going to say it's pale.
[245:20.14]Alright, day 15, done.
[245:28.62]We're good.
[245:39.89]Alright, I want a bunch of points again.
[245:48.72]Pass the fashion check?
[245:52.92]Hey, so what's your bit here?
[245:54.10]Are you just playing the game?
[245:55.09]Is nothing funny gonna happen?
[245:56.22]I mean, I'm... What do you want me to do, man?
[246:07.66]Something's wrong.
[246:12.11]Is it snowing or is this acid?
[246:18.48]Alright, last couple of days and then we're gonna finish weathering rooms.
[246:25.33]Okay, how to quit smoking.
[246:32.69]I'm gonna speedrun these next two days.
[246:38.20]Wait.
[246:42.51]Shit, I need fuel and people are gonna die.
[246:54.90]Uh, that's probably important.
[247:00.73]How we doing on food?
[247:05.80]Oh, the food is automatically replenishing.
[247:07.87]That's awesome.
[247:10.23]How's this doing?
[247:11.82]It's fine.
[247:14.55]It needs to be Tier 4.
[247:18.47]How's the lab doing?
[247:19.98]Fine.
[247:21.85]Quarantine.
[247:24.18]That's fine.
[247:24.98]Checkpoint.
[247:27.03]Alerts of pills are in baggage.
[247:29.07]Yeah, why not?
[247:35.19]Okay, I have to go turn this on.
[247:42.30]Are you gonna fight Redan?
[247:44.33]Um... Nah, he doesn't, um...
[247:48.89]He's not up to face me.
[247:56.64]I'm not going to have to have now.
[247:58.53]I need a more more of a challenge.
[248:00.58]He doesn't.
[248:00.90]He doesn't get to face me.
[248:05.12]Game model, OK?
[248:09.50]Pulse temp M. Okay, pulse temp M.
[248:24.64]Okay.
[248:35.25]Okay, pulse temp M. Mouth breathing.
[248:40.39]Pulse temp M, mouth breathing.
[248:42.72]God damn it, stop fucking- I can't say that word!
[248:49.95]Pulse temp M. Mouth bleeding.
[249:00.06]I'm just combining the words like an idiot.
[249:07.02]Oh!
[249:07.34]You might be fine now.
[249:16.80]Hmm, just the yellow eyes.
[249:18.05]That should be fine.
[249:22.09]Skin cleared up.
[249:28.80]Still aggressive.
[249:30.39]Still aggressive though, but I think you're alright.
[249:43.34]I think you're fine.
[249:46.60]What's in the bag?
[249:49.37]Yeah, he's fine.
[249:54.68]Good luck.
[249:58.76]Do the syringe?
[250:00.53]Not a bad idea.
[250:09.38]Alright, anybody else in here needs to go?
[250:13.19]What about you?
[250:14.92]Come on up.
[250:24.65]He looks clear now.
[250:27.12]Didn't he have a chest infection before?
[250:33.38]Still a little aggressive.
[250:34.53]That's fine.
[250:37.25]Temperature's back to normal.
[250:46.09]I think we're good.
[250:47.45]He should be fine.
[250:49.42]He seems to be cleared up.
[250:53.30]What about you?
[251:00.34]Oh...
[251:06.03]Dude, this is the part of the episode where this is a character that everybody loves and we haven't seen her in like two episodes.
[251:11.01]And it's like, what the fuck?
[251:12.28]No.
[251:14.45]Not Violet.
[251:15.48]Violet's my favorite character.
[251:16.92]I'm actually kind of fucking pissed at the writers for doing that.
[251:23.53]Because she was such a fun character, and they just decided to give her the red eyes and get rid of her.
[251:29.47]She was in the middle of her arc.
[251:31.21]Was she or was she not going to...
[251:34.38]find her father.
[251:35.63]You know what I mean?
[251:36.23]Like, it's fucking annoying.
[251:39.68]I'm done watching the show.
[251:41.21]I'm done with the show.
[251:44.68]I was going to watch up until this point and just pretend like the rest of the show doesn't exist.
[251:53.15]At least it's not a death sentence.
[251:55.72]Right?
[252:02.33]Your eyes are better.
[252:15.96]I don't like that.
[252:16.64]You still have these problems here.
[252:17.83]No, you can't come out.
[252:23.33]I'm sorry.
[252:23.75]That's too much infection for me.
[252:27.71]You would enjoy Blippo Plus?
[252:31.00]Is that the thing where it's kind of a TV channel?
[252:35.78]Yeah, I saw Vinny playing it.
[252:46.42]Hmm.
[252:47.65]Okay.
[252:48.79]So... Let's take a look.
[252:54.71]Oh, a green pencil, huh?
[252:59.65]I'm looking for the person that's been stealing the green pencil.
[253:09.00]This dude's a fucking alien.
[253:13.29]He didn't even come up on the scanner.
[253:18.31]Wait, is the target item confiscated?
[253:26.04]I thought I was supposed to kill the guy.
[253:27.62]Wait, that wasn't even...
[253:28.36]Wait, what?
[253:29.83]Apparently he was infected.
[253:31.56]Okay.
[253:35.54]He didn't even come up on the scanner.
[253:43.54]Uh, is that, uh, flush red?
[253:52.71]Oh.
[253:52.79]Skin rash.
[253:56.06]Skin rash, no reaction.
[254:07.66]Those look normal.
[254:17.24]You good?
[254:18.35]I think you're fine.
[254:18.87]A little bit of flush, that's fine.
[254:28.35]Oh, I forgot to say no reaction, but whatever.
[254:33.91]You didn't check her temperature?
[254:34.87]Yeah, I did.
[254:35.98]Oh, fuck!
[254:36.50]She has a skin rash!
[254:38.76]Uh, how do I- I don't want to kill her!
[254:41.04]I forgot about the rash!
[254:45.74]No, no, no, close the door, close the door, close the door.
[254:48.71]Don't let her in.
[254:50.04]Don't let her in!
[254:52.35]Oh, fuck.
[254:52.99]What do I do?
[254:53.47]Do I have to kill her?
[254:55.04]I don't wanna- But then everyone's gonna freak out!
[254:59.62]What if it's just a mild skin irritation?
[255:18.82]She's turning into a zombie.
[255:21.68]What are you doing?
[255:28.39]Don't take any risks.
[255:29.52]I have to kill her.
[255:30.18]You just want there to be like five people dead here tomorrow.
[255:37.18]Wait, you're saying the opposite of what would happen.
[255:40.24]But I'm saying the opposite of what would happen.
[255:50.38]I can't do it.
[255:56.39]It's probably just a mild skin rash.
[256:06.56]This is just a bad dream.
[256:16.95]You're too high for this.
[256:18.14]I am perfectly sober.
[256:20.00]Is that a reaction?
[256:27.75]Kind of.
[256:28.46]Yeah.
[256:31.95]You seem fine.
[256:41.68]He's fine.
[256:47.10]Okay.
[256:48.65]Good luck.
[257:06.13]This guy's perfectly healthy.
[257:08.88]Aggression.
[257:24.00]Okay, that's not...
[257:24.78]Aggression's not gonna get you necessarily quarantined, alright?
[257:29.43]Oh, that's a pretty heavy bruise, though.
[257:31.46]That's red bruising, isn't it?
[257:33.99]That's a deep bruise.
[257:36.00]Aggression, deep bruise.
[257:39.69]Uh, breathing?
[257:45.67]Okay.
[257:53.29]Okay, ooh.
[257:54.42]Aggression, deep bruise, temperature is climbing.
[257:59.19]Oh.
[258:00.64]Flippin' heck.
[258:14.34]Goodbye.
[258:23.04]Somebody shoot her, please!
[258:31.57]Don't fuck around, alright?
[258:49.37]Okay, that's heavy breathing, not monster breathing.
[258:53.34]I can't fucking...
[258:55.33]Wait!
[258:57.74]Okay, bite.
[259:01.55]Mouth bleeding?
[259:02.42]Ewww.
[259:15.36]That's a crazy pulse.
[259:18.85]And you got a bite.
[259:23.07]Anything else wrong with you?
[259:26.71]I might want to send him to the lab.
[259:35.99]Multiple bites?
[259:37.80]Oh my god.
[259:39.85]Okay.
[259:41.56]And he's aggressive.
[259:42.69]You know what?
[259:44.74]Do you get more points if you send him to the...
[259:49.67]Hold on.
[259:55.79]Cough, cough.
[259:59.55]What about his backpack?
[260:00.82]He's getting fucking...
[260:02.34]He's getting annihilated.
[260:04.05]I don't care what's in his backpack.
[260:15.09]What about the book?
[260:16.44]Oh.
[260:19.15]Wait, found a book.
[260:21.78]Hey.
[260:27.55]Why did it just do that?
[260:36.13]You look alright.
[260:40.91]Okay.
[260:50.06]Mhm.
[260:53.65]You seem fine.
[261:00.25]Alright.
[261:00.65]Congratulations.
[261:07.14]Come on in.
[261:15.27]I may... Come on!
[261:24.38]Let's just get this over with.
[261:25.71]This guy's got a map?
[261:27.77]What's this map for?
[261:28.66]Should I take the map?
[261:43.27]Just like high school.
[261:45.10]I mean, if it was a treasure map I wanted to keep it.
[262:03.31]He's clean.
[262:13.88]Alright, enjoy your stay.
[262:28.51]Grenade.
[262:32.36]Drugs in there?
[262:42.33]Okay, that's heavy breathing.
[262:50.14]Why are you holding your stomach?
[263:01.99]Did you ever have some internal bleeding or something?
[263:03.70]Internal damage?
[263:10.24]Oh yeah, that looks all messed up.
[263:14.85]Uh, okay, can I mark that?
[263:18.61]Okay, internal bleeding, but that's still fine.
[263:20.50]And she's flush, but that's fine.
[263:24.59]Nothing wrong with that.
[263:27.96]Did she have any contraband?
[263:30.27]She had guns, right?
[263:33.19]Am I making that up?
[263:34.57]No, she had weapons.
[263:40.24]It's under the lab, but don't I already know that it's internal bleeding?
[263:45.34]Do I not know?
[263:51.79]I'll take a better look.
[264:00.04]Prepare your belongings for inspection.
[264:03.62]I don't want to-
[264:14.58]Yeah.
[264:17.13]I gotta go to the.
[264:22.77]Person that just said OK.
[264:29.55]I just saw the red eyes and I was like, fuck, man.
[264:31.95]Like, am I gonna actually scan everything all over your body and shit?
[264:41.55]Didn't you have internal bleeding?
[264:44.17]Wait, what?
[264:50.90]Okay.
[265:25.05]Dude, just keep holding.
[265:26.06]It'll go, it'll go back up.
[265:29.27]I know you wanted to sell back here, but you just, if you hold a little longer, it could just fucking come back, man.
[265:36.87]And I got out already.
[265:46.82]Oh, that's it.
[265:54.08]Alright, this is the last day before the end of the day before I do Withering Rooms.
[266:04.10]Hey, we're good.
[266:14.73]Day 15.
[266:15.56]Here it comes.
[266:19.96]And I will tell all you withering room heads...
[266:23.76]I think there's actually like maybe an hour tops left in the game.
[266:27.96]So, don't worry.
[266:36.43]Some people think hiding items deep inside their... bodily cavities will work.
[266:42.53]But that's why we have Charlie.
[266:44.50]He's our specialist for these types of extractions.
[266:48.09]Quiet guy.
[266:48.74]Used to work in a morgue.
[266:50.53]You serious?
[266:58.39]Somebody putting a grenade?
[267:00.54]Up their ass?
[267:05.50]That's not a good place to put that, dude.
[267:20.68]Move it!
[267:30.91]I'm looking for my son.
[267:32.69]He was headed for this checkpoint.
[267:34.70]He's about 20.
[267:36.13]Blonde hair, wearing a black jacket.
[267:38.37]Have you seen him?
[267:40.02]He's infected.
[267:42.75]I never should have left him.
[267:44.70]Please, let me stay with him.
[267:48.39]I think that guy's dead.
[268:01.81]Pale lips?
[268:02.55]Yeah, this is pale.
[268:04.37]Alright, let's take a look.
[268:05.22]Let me just make sure you don't pose a threat to anybody.
[268:07.14]You seem alright.
[268:32.89]What the fuck?
[268:36.63]Alright, I think you're clean.
[268:38.34]Except for the pale lips.
[268:48.38]Alright, don't cause any trouble.
[268:53.84]His pale lips, whatever.
[269:01.26]You are in a quarantine zone.
[269:02.72]I don't have any symptoms, see?
[269:06.02]Remove your outer clothing.
[269:07.75]Hats, glasses, and gloves.
[269:11.13]What the fuck was that?
[269:17.51]What just happened?
[269:22.32]Bro, did you just kill the guy that I sent back here?
[269:24.53]He didn't even get 10 feet into the zone.
[269:38.09]Hey!
[269:49.72]He was a zombie.
[269:52.71]Alright, I gotta go.
[269:58.19]Excellent.
[270:00.59]Okay.
[270:04.39]You don't have any bites.
[270:07.06]Not aggressive.
[270:07.84]No temperature.
[270:12.03]Nothing weird going on in your internal organs, no?
[270:15.50]Wait, what was that?
[270:20.57]You do have a grenade on you.
[270:27.86]The hell are you doing?
[270:34.93]Do I still let you in?
[270:42.81]I mean, she's perfectly healthy.
[270:44.68]I can't believe it.
[270:48.78]Thank you.
[270:50.72]Wait, what do you mean contraband not seized?
[270:52.51]Did you even do your fucking job?
[270:54.90]Why was it not seized?
[270:56.10]What are you talking about?
[270:56.97]She had two things on her?
[271:08.41]Identification verified.
[271:15.58]Fuck.
[271:17.45]Alright, well, you're going to the cage.
[271:18.70]Whatever.
[271:33.89]Broken bone or something?
[271:36.62]What's going on here?
[271:37.54]This bone...
[271:38.01]There's something wrong with the bone.
[271:42.04]Is that a shadow on the bone or something?
[271:43.38]What does that mean?
[272:01.24]You are in a quarantine zone.
[272:03.55]Stay calm and wait for...
[272:04.84]I want to see, yeah, let's go to the lab.
[272:06.04]Remove your outer clothing.
[272:07.07]That looked kind of weird, right?
[272:12.53]Yeah, is that... that looks like darkening.
[272:14.82]Yeah, that's something going on there.
[272:17.21]Lab.
[272:19.00]Wait, I need to say that something's weird, right?
[272:29.78]Don't make me wait.
[272:34.84]Hurry up, I'm starving.
[272:37.03]You better have food back there.
[272:42.37]The fuck is that?
[272:46.64]What is that?
[272:50.89]Is that an organ?
[272:51.82]Or is that, what is that, a potato?
[272:53.51]Did you shove a potato up your ass?
[272:59.83]Is that contraband?
[273:00.89]I mean, you just check it out, I guess.
[273:13.40]What is that?
[273:21.42]This game's messed up.
[273:34.43]It was an emergency poop.
[273:38.26]Besides the aggression and the grenade, you gotta go to quarantine.
[273:49.85]Aggression's a sign!
[273:50.90]Oh, shit.
[273:55.24]Hold on.
[273:58.71]Okay, now you can go in.
[274:01.66]Convoy arriving today.
[274:11.65]You're not well.
[274:22.32]Oh man.
[274:36.39]Oh, that's bad.
[274:37.82]Monster breathing.
[274:42.00]Crazy temp.
[274:43.43]Moderate pulse.
[274:49.03]Monster infected breath.
[274:53.33]And she's got yellow skin.
[274:58.82]What else is wrong with you?
[275:01.28]You are in a quarantine zone.
[275:05.74]And you've got a fucking sausage in here?
[275:11.62]Why do you have a sausage?
[275:15.36]What?
[275:16.97]And there's another weird, like, poop.
[275:18.86]This is weird.
[275:19.62]This game is weird.
[275:28.54]Okay, goodbye.
[275:33.07]Sorry.
[275:38.26]Where do you keep all your tools?
[275:40.31]I don't see no backpack.
[275:49.43]Red bruising.
[275:58.22]Okay.
[275:58.96]Check.
[276:00.53]Check.
[276:05.72]Mmh.
[276:07.89]A red bruising and monster temp and aggression.
[276:20.60]Move it, jackass!
[276:29.14]Is he dead?
[276:42.92]I'm... Oh, don't click.
[276:46.97]The dude bit you?
[276:47.82]I'll be fine.
[276:50.20]I'm the main character.
[276:52.45]They'll find the injectable antidote by the end of the second season.
[276:55.32]I'll be fine.
[276:57.77]Heavy breathing.
[277:19.14]God damn it!
[277:21.28]So many of you are dying!
[277:25.96]So is it high temp and what else did he have wrong with him?
[277:36.13]Are we actually like extracting poop from them?
[277:40.11]What is this?
[277:41.96]I wanted to see what it was.
[277:45.06]Well, whatever.
[277:45.72]He's... Goodbye.
[277:50.24]Is it like a bunker?
[277:53.56]Don't make me wait.
[277:59.25]Please, if you find something, just fly, okay?
[278:03.64]Alright, dude.
[278:04.92]I'm gonna let you in.
[278:07.75]I've already decided that I'm letting you in.
[278:10.57]Don't make me regret this.
[278:20.53]No, I'm not.
[278:41.37]Okay, so that's moderate monster breathing, moderate temperature, and conjunctivitis.
[279:02.46]Oh fuck, he had a backpack.
[279:08.26]No, I looked at it already.
[279:13.94]You didn't even x-ray him?
[279:15.12]I didn't even need to.
[279:16.35]Did you hear that?
[279:17.84]Someone's watching us.
[279:18.83]I know it.
[279:31.44]okay lungs look clear
[279:40.35]Oh, that's not good.
[279:41.53]Okay, that's regular bruising.
[279:43.40]That's not a problem.
[279:44.02]That's okay.
[279:46.13]Oh, wait a minute.
[279:56.21]Escape.
[279:56.79]They say the place is like beatings, injections, you'll recognize it with the symptoms.
[280:03.95]Is this you?
[280:04.42]That's not good.
[280:08.28]Is this you?
[280:10.60]Oh, fuck.
[280:11.31]Yeah, okay.
[280:12.12]Is that quarantine?
[280:25.30]Wait, does it say send to quarantine?
[280:26.75]Dude, I don't want to send her to quarantine.
[280:30.59]There's a fucking lunatic in here.
[280:37.23]You can check the age.
[280:38.04]How do you check age?
[280:40.30]How do I do that?
[280:55.14]You can ask?
[280:56.66]I don't think you can.
[280:57.59]I think this is her.
[281:00.54]Let me take a look at who's still in there.
[281:01.96]Yeah, I think this is her.
[281:11.62]Okay, there's one more.
[281:13.31]Hold on.
[281:18.76]Yep.
[281:19.42]Okay, there it is.
[281:20.67]Okay, send to quarantine, but there's a fucking monster in there!
[281:35.96]Okay, well, I'm gonna keep a close eye on that.
[281:42.80]Good work, grunt.
[281:44.33]Don't get used to the praise.
[281:49.32]Check on the dad in the morning.
[281:52.50]Okay, well, can I- can you come out?
[281:57.98]And then just send... Can I just send her back?
[282:00.11]Okay, there we go.
[282:03.87]Alright, you're good.
[282:18.04]Got a lot of shit in here, man.
[282:25.38]Okay, why wouldn't I comp- why would I not confiscate that?
[282:32.13]Just like high school.
[282:36.01]Dude, I don't want you in here.
[282:40.24]Alright, what's your deal, man?
[282:49.65]Oh!
[282:52.00]Oops.
[283:15.65]kidney problem.
[283:32.01]No symptoms?
[283:32.95]So the shadow thingy on the bone is not a symptom?
[283:40.49]Does everybody just look like that?
[283:47.58]Okay, well, this guy has zombie parts.
[283:49.58]I don't really want this guy here.
[283:57.40]Wait, hold on.
[284:02.14]That was climbing.
[284:08.55]Okay.
[284:11.19]Hmm, he's fine.
[284:17.33]Besides being a weirdo.
[284:20.98]Pale.
[284:31.30]Not paying attention.
[284:32.19]What?
[284:32.55]Yellow eyes?
[284:33.73]He's got, he's pale.
[284:37.07]He had a red rash on his arm.
[284:38.53]He's pale.
[284:39.12]He's, he's, look, he's supposed to be in here.
[284:45.28]You're supposed to kill the people with zombie parts?
[284:47.33]Who said that?
[284:51.48]Means you have to kill him?
[284:52.81]Do I?
[285:04.77]Well, if I'm somebody in here, I'm freaking out right now.
[285:08.58]I'm like, oh, fuck, dude.
[285:10.29]I'm hiding every cough.
[285:12.06]I'm hiding every...
[285:13.75]Dude, I'm gonna be- I'm gonna get eight hours of sleep at night
[285:25.76]Are you sure this area is secure?
[285:28.25]It doesn't feel secure.
[285:45.00]Pale?
[285:50.66]Uh-oh, that's a brain issue.
[285:52.79]Is that internal bleeding or is that a brain problem?
[286:15.83]Ooh.
[286:19.55]Ooh.
[286:22.22]Alright, you could have just been hit by something, right?
[286:27.96]Alright, that's internal bleeding and very heavy red bruising.
[286:33.65]I'm sorry, but we have to put you in the quarantine.
[286:40.47]I feel fine, but please don't do this
[286:58.84]Okay, you're fine.
[287:00.18]This is just a bad dream.
[287:10.59]Alright, only two more.
[287:19.72]That's a new symptom.
[287:24.31]Yeah, that's a green and yellow pus coming out of the eyes.
[287:27.47]That's a new symptom.
[287:30.38]See ya.
[287:37.22]Move it.
[287:44.74]Oh, no.
[287:46.52]I thought that was a knife.
[287:54.67]Okay, heavy bruising.
[287:56.05]Mmm, okay.
[288:04.29]Okay.
[288:18.07]Is that brain okay looking?
[288:19.72]Okay.
[288:27.37]Heavy breathing.
[288:31.53]Although that's not that deep.
[288:36.49]I think you're clear.
[288:51.92]Yeah.
[288:53.56]Alright.
[288:55.03]Hooray!
[288:59.25]Uh, I need more beds I think?
[289:09.00]Is it too much overpopulation?
[289:18.82]Okay.
[289:20.79]Today is evac day.
[289:22.30]Yeah, let's go.
[289:28.51]Oh, the lab.
[289:30.71]The lab, the lab, yep.
[289:32.10]Oh, I gotta feed the dog.
[289:35.85]Isn't there already a body over there?
[289:41.99]I swear there's one already over here.
[289:45.26]Apparently not.
[289:49.22]But let me do this.
[289:51.24]Alright, after this I'm going to take a break.
[289:52.58]This game is really fun.
[289:57.28]I might return to this just to finish it out.
[290:04.82]but I do want to finish withering rooms.
[290:13.61]That last hour of that game has been... Oh shit, nose pus.
[290:32.24]Okay.
[290:34.06]I need, wait, I need this.
[290:56.54]Excuse me.
[291:01.98]Here you go.
[291:12.02]Alright, EVAC Day.
[291:23.36]I'm gonna send a ton of people to...
[291:29.53]Okay, we need to keep some of these people here, right?
[291:33.26]Do you have to stay?
[291:33.97]You go to the research area.
