[01:05.97]We're going balls in.
[01:07.08]Yep, we went balls in.
[01:10.06]Might not have been the greatest of ideas.
[01:14.34]Give me that health pack and then we're going balls in!
[01:19.39]I'm gonna die.
[01:21.10]Just stay behind the tank.
[01:23.87]You're not a tank.
[01:24.77]Your ball is in.
[01:25.72]Do you understand how much balls are in right now?
[01:28.98]A bunch of balls.
[01:30.06]They're all in.
[01:30.85]I'm dead.
[01:31.07]Can you help me?
[01:32.49]I shot that guy like five times in the head.
[01:35.77]By the way, I took all the ammo.
[01:37.34]Good luck.
[01:39.56]Who's this?
[01:41.32]What?
[01:41.88]This is like an NPC.
[01:44.86]What?
[01:45.82]Where did he go?
[01:49.35]What the hell?
[01:50.78]Okay, there's multiple guys.
[01:53.04]Wait, wait, don't hurt them.
[01:54.19]Wait, Ball Steep!
[01:55.59]They're just waiters.
[01:58.32]You got my fucking order wrong for the last time.
[02:03.27]I wanted oyster crackers in my fucking honeydew donut.
[02:06.19]I know it's the window, but why would they make a tripod?
[02:08.53]It's already obnoxious as hell to look at the green room!
[02:12.63]Hey, how about you keep complaining, Star?
[02:15.06]I will!
[02:15.95]We gotta get that demon out of her!
[02:19.81]Stop doing math problems!
[02:22.30]That's not gonna save you!
[02:24.08]Fucking algebra is not gonna save you here!
[02:27.00]Did you just hear that snort?
[02:28.42]She doesn't usually snort.
[02:32.16]She doesn't usually do that.
[02:33.30]You know what stirs?
[02:35.41]I'm going to...
[02:36.38]I'm comedy right?
[02:39.05]No.
[02:40.82]No, on the comedy scale, I think you're... You know, comedy, right?
[02:45.29]You're a zero on the comedy scale.
[02:47.28]Sorry, dude.
[02:50.38]The late great Rodney Dangerfield once said, Hey, let me tell you something.
[02:54.84]Star is pretty low on the scale.
[02:58.43]He said that right before he died.
[03:02.21]That's how you get no respect.
[03:03.58]Star is one of the worst comedians I think I've ever seen.
[03:06.01]You think you take priority now?
[03:08.13]After all the shit you've done?
[03:10.62]Yeah.
[03:10.96]What shit have I done?
[03:13.35]Spit on my pizza that one time.
[03:15.80]I've been supportive of you.
[03:17.28]Spit on that pizza that one time.
[03:18.67]I offered you to come here and stream if your internet wasn't working.
[03:22.10]Spit on my pizza that one time.
[03:23.34]Nobody knows about that story.
[03:27.23]He was spitting on my pizza when I was in the bathroom.
[03:28.92]I wanted our DNA to meld.
[03:33.33]You got slime

[04:02.32]And he would, like, touch his nose, and they're like, oh, it's Slime Noob!
[04:05.79]I don't remember this at all.
