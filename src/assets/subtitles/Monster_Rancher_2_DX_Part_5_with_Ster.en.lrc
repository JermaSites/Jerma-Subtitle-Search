[ve:61.1.100]

[00:00.03]I have.
[00:02.21]I don't have the game downloaded.
[00:04.96]It's just on Steam.
[00:06.14]Steam, yeah.
[00:11.79]I'm on like two hours of sleep.
[00:14.83]I feel like you've been doing this to yourself a lot lately.
[00:16.82]You've been getting up early.
[00:17.84]I didn't do it.
[00:18.74]I did not do it to myself last night.
[00:20.84]I laid down to go to bed at like 1 a.m.
[00:23.58]And then I just laid there until 6 a.m.
[00:27.21]Yeah, that sucks.
[00:28.61]I hate when that happens.
[00:35.74]Yeah, but if you see my monsters, you'll know my strategy and you'll try to catapult me.
[00:39.22]I saw your monsters.
[00:40.87]You already did?
[00:41.43]I'm your biggest fan.
[00:44.93]What the hell?
[00:47.81]I saw, um... That's What I Do.
[00:51.46]You're not supposed to see these.
[00:54.58]And I saw that your favorite song of all time is the official Batman Forever song.
[00:59.03]Yeah, and that's sick, by the way.
[01:03.92]That's not...
[01:05.20]We got a Seal hater in the chat right now in my ear.
[01:11.39]Yep.
[01:11.83]That's unbelievable.
[01:12.89]I actually can't believe that.
[01:14.47]I didn't even hear who Seal was, and this is totally giving me like Big Daddy vibes, Adam Sandler.
[01:19.90]Oh, you don't know who Sticks?
[01:21.12]Sticks is the greatest band of all time!
[01:23.02]No, I'm sorry.
[01:24.32]Who?
[01:25.52]Who?
[01:26.14]Sorry, that was really loud.
[01:31.57]Yeah, the official Batman Forever soundtrack, which is a good soundtrack, by the way.
[01:38.26]How come nobody can see what I'm showing right now?
[01:41.67]Oh, there we go.
[01:46.37]This tour is so bad, bro.
[01:50.62]Well, what are your favorite songs?
[01:52.74]Let's see what you pull.
[01:53.94]I don't know.
[01:54.32]I'm going to have to figure it out.
[01:55.62]I saw like a lot of songs weren't on there.
[01:57.79]I might go by albums.
[01:59.15]You're telling me that Kiss from a Rose, Rainbow Connection, and Dare from the Gorillas aren't a good top three.
[02:07.72]I have to look up Rainbow Connection.
[02:10.75]I don't know what this is.
[02:11.55]Oh my God.
[02:13.39]Oh boy.
[02:15.98]Okay.
[02:21.03]The first thing that came up was Kermit.
[02:24.47]Oh man.
[02:24.77]Rainbow Connection from the Muppet movie.
[02:27.14]Oh my God.
[02:28.92]Is that what it is?
[02:31.62]Yeah.
[02:32.81]Yeah.
[02:40.82]Don't look at what I'm doing.
[02:42.42]This is one of your top three favorite songs.
[02:45.30]I would say that's accurate.
[02:56.05]I did hear you listening to a... What is it?
[03:00.86]The Neverhood soundtrack?
[03:03.68]Yeah, but we're talking... That's probably one of the best albums ever.
[03:08.73]We're talking individual soundtrack.
[03:15.34]Okay, so I'm going to buy this game.
[03:16.40]I'm sending you an invoice.
[03:20.46]I will invoice you for all of my time spent.
[03:26.43]Fine, whatever.
[03:34.22]Hashtag germapartner.
[03:38.14]No, we talked about this.
[03:45.43]I love this game.
[03:46.75]I know what I'm doing.
[03:47.69]He knows what he's doing, guys.
[03:48.71]But not as much as from looking at you, not as much as you know what you're doing.
[03:52.96]You're you're like min maxing.
[03:58.22]I'll be the final boss.
[03:59.90]I will be the last boss.
[04:01.32]I don't think I think you know what you're doing, but you're still going to perform the worst.
[04:05.43]It's all AI versus AI.
[04:07.53]Okay, I have a really strong monster.
[04:09.28]I saw your guy, the cape guy, get one-punched.
[04:12.26]Yes.
[04:12.96]It's very possible.
[04:13.91]So, like... We're going to do a rest and error entry, by the way.
[04:20.40]Don't get with his secrets.
[04:23.39]This song is not good.
[04:27.06]Did you hear the song when you were like three years old?
[04:30.09]Are you talking?
[04:30.65]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[04:31.61]And it was like a formative childhood moment.
[04:33.71]You have got to be kidding me.
[04:35.73]That is one of the most well-written, well-performed.
[04:38.82]That is one of the most well-written songs in the world.
[04:41.22]That's in the Library of Congress.
[04:43.20]It's that important.
[04:47.07]I think you're going to lose this one.
[04:48.11]The debate.
[04:49.57]The debate is you're going to get crushed in this one.
[04:55.61]Kermit is not a good singer.
[05:02.96]That's unbelievable.
[05:05.29]I can't believe I'm hearing this.
[05:08.77]The tournament villain.
[05:10.91]He's the tournament villain.
[05:13.82]Before my monster fights anyone, I'm just going to have like a diss track ready for everyone's favorite song that their monster came from.
[05:21.89]I'm going to be the Gary.
[05:25.18]You think your little monster is strong enough to take on mine?
[05:30.30]Yeah, I can't.
[05:32.01]Why?
[05:32.33]Why?
[05:32.93]This dude just called Rainbow Connection terrible.
[05:38.81]I think you are in, like, the... It's not terrible.
[05:42.52]Like I'm saying, it's probably from some movie, and it, like, made you realize you are attracted to frogs when you were a child, and it was very important to you.
[05:50.23]But, like, as a song...
[05:55.59]As a song, it's great.
[06:01.18]You agreed?
[06:02.14]He was like, yeah, yeah.
[06:02.88]No, I said, as a song, it's great.
[06:05.26]People just go, wow, it's the Muppets.
[06:08.41]Hey, did you know that it's from the Muppets?
[06:11.93]No, I had no idea.
[06:12.79]Oh, wait, the Curb of the Frog sang that song?
[06:15.80]Oh, God, that's a Muppet shit.
[06:17.34]That's a family-friendly, family kid show.
[06:20.00]God, let me change my answer.
[06:26.59]No, it's because it's Kermit is why it's good.
[06:29.33]I think you've gaslighted your chat, too.
[06:31.37]No, I haven't.
[06:33.15]Because I see a lot of people agreeing that, like, oh, no, it's beautiful, but, like, top three.
[06:38.46]Are you live?
[06:39.26]I've just been sitting here talking shit.
[06:41.14]What's your chat say?
[06:43.24]What does the Ster chat have to say about Rainbow Connection?
[06:44.93]My last message is Muppet Slop.
[06:47.61]Okay, but that's somebody being funny.
[06:49.25]Ask him for real.
[06:50.83]Get a poll in your chat.
[06:53.82]And not, is this the top?
[06:55.03]Everyone chime in.
[06:55.61]Remember, it's subjective.
[06:57.97]My top favorite song is not going to be your, we're two different people.
[07:01.12]We have two different, completely different things.
[07:02.94]That's fine.
[07:03.38]It could be my top favorite, but Sturchat, do you agree that Rainbow Connection is a very nice song?
[07:10.92]It's a very good song.
[07:12.62]That's all I'm asking.
[07:18.41]My chat is pretty unanimously no.
[07:22.34]That's not even as unbelievable.
[07:24.16]And then your chat is fairly unanimously yes, which is why I think you've gaslighted them.
[07:30.35]And you haven't gaslit yours the same way that I have mine, apparently.
[07:34.68]I think this is the first time a lot of my chats probably heard it as well.
[07:42.83]that's it's well hey that's not just me saying that we need we need to go out music producers songwriters have have said that that song is one is an inspiration to why they do music in the first place we need to boom survey says 100 people we surveyed 100 people and this is what they said about the Kermit song it's gonna be like 80 to 90 people are gonna say it's a great song
[08:10.96]That's a Disney adult song.
[08:13.42]Oh my God, dude.
[08:14.60]I can't even believe what I'm fucking hearing right now.
[08:17.33]It's unbelievable to me.
[08:23.58]Is it really unbelievable though?
[08:25.24]It is.
[08:30.79]I hope you get the fart monster and that's like what you have to do.
[08:35.15]I'm probably going to... I bought the game.
[08:36.96]I might do my pulls now.
[08:39.36]Go open up the Wikipedia page for Rainbow Connection and go down to, like, Legacy and read the whole... I want you to read the entire thing to me out loud.
[08:50.78]Okay.
[08:50.90]It's a Disney song?
[08:52.24]Oh, my God.
[08:52.82]Ban that person from the chat permanently.
[08:56.15]It is.
[08:56.29]Disney bought the Muppets.
[08:57.75]This predates Disney by, like, 25 years.
[09:02.54]This is when it was a Jim Henson company.
[09:07.46]Disney bought the rights.
[09:09.36]They had nothing to do with Rainbow Connection.
[09:13.53]I'll crash out over this.
[09:14.49]I don't care.
[09:24.62]It was top 25 on the US charts.
[09:28.57]Oh, oh, all 25 of us.
[09:31.05]Top 25.
[09:31.70]We must be incorrect.
[09:32.66]All of us.
[09:35.38]No, Jerma, that doesn't mean there were 25 people that liked it.
[09:38.21]All 25 of you.
[09:39.73]Yeah.
[09:43.80]Disney slop.
[09:44.90]Oh, my God.
[09:45.60]I want to be in this entire chat room.
[09:47.36]That was 1980.
[09:48.10]Okay, so you had no choice on what was on the radio.
[09:52.31]You changed the station from one to two.
[09:55.61]Ban everyone.
[09:56.76]Everyone's banned.
[10:07.04]Wait, hold on.
[10:10.21]Call the Muppets Disney is an insult to Jim Henson and his legacy.
[10:12.89]Oh my God.
[10:13.45]1,000% agree.
[10:15.01]I want, how do I, you have banned protection for a year.
[10:20.28]Go ahead and say whatever you want.
[10:23.58]On the Wikipedia page, the most recent...
[10:27.76]2025 rendition of the song is album music from Disneyland Resort 70th Celebration.
[10:35.81]Because it was such a culturally important song that they redid it and redid it.
[10:41.06]I'm talking about the original.
[10:42.50]I'm talking about Kermit the Frog, Jim Henson on the vocals with the banjo.
[10:48.23]Send it.
[10:52.03]What's your favorite Muppet?
[10:54.97]Gonzo.
[10:57.99]So wouldn't it be better if Gonzo sang it?
[11:04.80]It received an Academy Award.
[11:06.14]It also sounded so defeated.
[11:07.46]It received an Academy Award nomination from Best Original Song.
[11:10.08]Yeah, it's getting awards and shit.
[11:14.15]Oh fuck, wait, he's gonna die!
[11:15.61]What?
[11:23.66]Is he alright?
[11:26.78]No, if he dies, I can't use him.
[11:28.10]I have to do another one.
[11:30.63]Oh, he's cheating.
[11:34.01]He's not gonna die.
[11:35.66]If we pull a bad one, we can just kill it and say, oh, I had to do a better one.
[11:49.86]Hey, you can have your favorite song.
[11:51.62]I can have my favorite song.
[11:53.65]But denying the cultural importance of Jim Henson in the original Muppet movie with the banjo singing Rainbow Connection is slanderous.
[12:05.04]It is.
[12:10.84]I'm following your like 10 paragraph document on how to install this.
[12:16.36]It is just Monster Rancher 1 and 2 DX on Steam.
[12:19.30]That is correct.
[12:28.71]Dude, I... We should've... Oh, what a dumb idiot I am.
[12:32.96]The two musicians we should've asked.
[12:36.12]Vinny's take and Poke's take.
[12:37.66]I bet you anything... You could just, like, drag Poke back in.
[12:42.29]He'd probably be like, whatever.
[12:45.40]Dude, he likes frogs.
[12:47.52]I think he'd be into it.
[12:48.90]I'm telling you.
[12:50.57]Bring in the two music people and we'll see.
[13:00.76]But that is kind of admitting that you don't have the authority on this.
[13:05.07]That's fine.
[13:18.40]How the heck do you disable Steam Cloud?
[13:23.31]Just right click and do properties on it?
[13:25.14]I found it.
[13:26.54]I found it.
[13:40.98]Don't ask Vinny why, because you think Vinny... Oh, because you think Vinny's going to agree?
[13:45.89]I think Vinny is going to not only agree, but he'll be able to explain as, you know, as a musician, the cultural importance and the impact that it had.
[13:55.08]Vinny's going to bail me out on this one.
[13:57.10]I'm certain of it.
[14:00.25]Then why have I never heard it?
[14:04.29]How have you never heard it?
[14:08.96]I don't know.
[14:13.81]I guess I'm not cultured.
[14:15.15]I gotta laugh so hard if all three of you are like, no, dude, that sucks.
[14:19.21]I will melt.
[14:21.44]I will literally melt into the chair and I'll turn purple with rage after.
[14:29.47]Little grape juice boy.
[14:38.40]I gotta check to see.
[14:39.07]I think this guy's almost done.
[14:54.95]Dude, your instructions are, your instructions are like not good here.
[14:59.29]What are you talking about?
[15:00.52]You want me to rename the Koei Tecmo folder to backup?
[15:04.20]Yes.
[15:05.74]The whole folder.
[15:06.62]I have like Neo 2 in here and stuff.
[15:10.25]So?
[15:13.86]Oh, you mean you say you don't want to mess up all your... Well, that was just like, I just copied, that's just copy and pasted from the website.
[15:21.53]Okay, okay.
[15:25.02]Oh, no, your Neo 2 file that you haven't touched in like four and a half years.
[15:30.77]It's my top three favorite save file.
[15:34.33]Okay, I will make fun of you over that if that's true.
[15:39.56]I get to make fun of you about Neo 2 being your top save file.
[15:45.75]Wait, what is your top save file of all time?
[15:50.56]Uh, it's...
[15:52.22]It's gotta be Bloodborne.
[15:54.56]Bloodborne, uh, Gary.
[15:56.39]The character Gary.
[15:59.67]It's my first Bloodborne character, I believe.
[16:02.55]And he's still saved on the same PlayStation.
[16:11.83]Uh, you mean my PlayStation?
[16:13.85]Well, this is PlayStation 3.
[16:15.93]Oh.
[16:16.51]Bloodborne's PlayStation 3?
[16:18.34]There's been too many of them, dude.
[16:20.06]PS4.
[16:32.74]Alright, let me take a look.
[16:36.82]Alright, I got a little bit more time on him.
[16:39.77]Yeah, I'm getting the game working.
[16:43.28]Yeah, the reason why you're doing that is you probably remember from the old games is half of the monsters are behind a lock.
[16:51.47]So if you get, oh, I'm going to type in my favorite song and it'll say, oh, here it comes.
[16:55.10]Here comes the big monster.
[16:56.02]Here comes a big reveal.
[16:57.58]Oh, sorry, that monster.
[16:58.42]You can't.
[16:59.06]That's a special monster.
[16:59.99]You can't do that.
[17:01.77]And it's like more than a third of every single thing you can pull.
[17:05.61]So I could just unlock the whole thing, give everybody a bunch of money and not have to worry about it.
[17:10.78]Save file number one.
[17:14.30]is trainer yes yeah so you do that and then you can just save wherever you want in a different slot but that is correct you got it okay hey Jerma can you make them remaster Bloodborne um I I don't have the power to do that I'm sorry are you playing this in like the tiny window
[17:43.97]no it opens up into a full screen you oh you okay I'm sorry about this but you're gonna have to exit the game exit the game go to that first when you choose between one or two go to settings and say yes I'd like the game in full screen
[18:14.12]Okay, I'm doing one more Errantry.
[18:16.14]I want to get a heavier attack, I think.
[18:19.25]Wait, where?
[18:21.75]When you open up Monster Rancher 2, it's going to open up a little window that says, do you want to play 1 or 2?
[18:29.88]Yeah.
[18:30.58]And then say options or settings on that menu.
[18:33.10]Options, and then it says FF or sound.
[18:36.81]This should be a full screen.
[18:39.25]It's the only options.
[18:41.58]Are you in the window where it's picked between Monster Rancher 1 and 2?
[18:46.30]Yeah.
[18:47.00]And in the settings there, there's no checkbox for full screen?
[18:52.01]No.
[18:53.47]What?
[18:58.89]It's in there.
[18:59.68]There's none of the menu right there?
[19:03.18]You're opening the right thing, right?
[19:07.38]Okay, wait.
[19:09.20]Keyboard and resolution settings.
[19:12.35]Oh yeah, you gotta keep going.
[19:13.65]Yeah, I read key... Why would keyboard and resolu... I just... I got thrown off.
[19:19.00]Are you playing this with a controller?
[19:20.14]It doesn't matter.
[19:21.28]Either one is fine.
[19:30.36]Ster got the Bitcoin minor edition.
[19:33.95]I think so.
[19:40.42]I love this one person dancing around to the music and everybody else like unanimously like hates these songs.
[19:48.45]We got one person dancing at the club here.
[19:52.84]Oh hell yeah, don't tell Ster what just happened.
[19:59.21]OK.
[20:11.23]don't fail it don't do it come on I hope I get the obelisk I actually am curious of what you pull I I don't really want to know what everybody pulls but
[20:38.93]For you, it's an exception.
[20:40.71]Because you're min-maxing so hard you actually want to counterpick.
[20:44.65]When it's going to be like Brown Robin, isn't it?
[20:46.64]It is Brown Robin.
[20:48.20]Then how do you counterpick?
[20:49.28]You don't.
[20:51.02]Exactly.
[20:51.96]But you're going to have to pick one of your three monsters to go into the tournament.
[20:55.37]So what do I think you would put in this?
[20:58.53]I'm only going to have one.
[21:01.05]You're going to have three.
[21:01.94]What do you mean only have one?
[21:03.54]Okay, if you copy the file three times.
[21:07.01]What, you're not going to train three monsters?
[21:11.03]We'll see.
[21:12.69]You're not going to put in the hour and ten minutes it takes to do each one?
[21:16.09]I thought you liked this game.
[21:17.64]You could just play it for fun, too.
[21:19.24]Yeah, but if my monster's going to... My one guy's just going to sweep.
[21:30.81]That's fine.
[21:31.33]You pick a monster... You have to pick a monster to go into each bracket.
[21:38.48]Well, let me get your opinion on this, because we were trying to figure it out.
[21:40.56]Disk stone or slate generating?
[21:43.23]Disk stone.
[21:48.54]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[21:49.16]Yeah, no, it's the shrine, right?
[21:50.34]Yeah.
[21:52.82]Everybody has three monsters.
[21:56.03]There's no lazy town.
[21:57.97]Well, that's too bad.
[21:58.88]You can try album titles, artist names.
[22:01.36]Some of the stuff is weirdly labeled.
[22:04.74]Like, I was looking up Miku last night, and there's no Miku songs in there, but if you type in SEGA as the artist, it's like, oh, remember this game, the Hatsune Miku game that came out on the Dreamcast?
[22:25.14]Hmm.
[22:29.05]You need the album name, and it only brings up the whole CD titles.
[22:34.69]Though the titles are like the titles of the CDs, I think.
[22:42.64]Look up artist too.
[22:43.76]Actually, I think he's going to beat this.
[22:45.66]No.
[22:55.68]Come on.
[23:00.34]The Miku songs are credited to the song producer, not to Miku.
[23:06.68]oh my god dude big rock guy would be awesome I hope somebody gets one of the big rock guys attorney suggestion most competitive attorneys use a stat cap
[23:31.41]you can't just tell me the name of a broken op monster from some random no no no it has to be your song you like it can't be like well you know um you know I really am into a random Kermit song that no one's ever heard of that's me I like that song by the way you're looking at the monster right now it's not an op monster it's like one of the defaults mixed with something else
[23:57.33]Hold on, I'm trying to navigate my Spotify, and they just keep, like, Windows 11.
[24:02.11]Yeah, so you're not going to pull, like, oh, hey, yeah, dude, actually, my favorite song, I actually really liked the, like, Abbott and Costello DVD commentary.
[24:10.12]It was great.
[24:11.48]That's how you get, like, the secret monster?
[24:12.78]No, you're not doing that.
[24:21.07]Nice job, Yermit.
[24:31.16]going into the deep, the deep dark web of internet songs.
[24:35.67]Nothing is in here.
[24:37.15]What's a name a song that you like?
[24:39.99]No.
[24:40.91]Why not?
[24:41.45]Yeah, well, you can make fun of my song, but we don't get to hear yours.
[24:45.94]I'm debating.
[24:46.82]I'm considering.
[24:47.94]What do you like?
[24:48.80]Give us like a top five, top 10.
[24:51.83]Um, I'm debating.
[24:53.29]I'm in debating mode.
[24:54.53]I was trying to do albums, but the album wasn't there.
[24:56.49]I went for it to Pimp a Butterfly, but they just have individual songs.
[25:01.42]Okay.
[25:14.70]Sterza, the lazy town theme.
[25:17.80]They don't have that either.
[25:18.70]Yeah.
[25:23.29]A base.
[25:27.59]We need a Spotify recap.
[25:29.27]My Spotify recap, guys, would be like the first three intros of Fullmetal Alchemist like 400 times.
[25:36.20]And then Rainbow Connection probably five times.
[25:40.79]What?
[25:44.33]It brought back a memory to me.
[25:46.04]You're saying that like... You said Fullmetal Alchemist like the soundtrack?
[25:50.47]Yeah, I always, it's always funny when you, when you pull up like some song that you like, and this is, I don't know what's wrong with me.
[25:56.46]Everybody does this, I feel like though.
[25:58.98]And you see the bump where everyone has replayed and you realize why that is, is because everybody, let's say that bump, the YouTube video bump of where the song really hits.
[26:12.94]I feel like I will sit there and hit that bump at least 10 to 15 times when I'm listening to the song.
[26:21.34]I was just laughing because I got into an Uber once and the entire ride the guy listened to only anime intro songs and he drove like an insane person.
[26:33.61]Two of the anime intros were you kind of like glued to the back of the seat like, what the fuck?
[26:38.36]Yeah, and he was like a did not hit the brakes once kind of driver like it's getting everywhere.
[26:46.41]He was in the zone.
[26:49.10]had his hands behind his back steering with his teeth like naruto running oh my god dude yeah it was wild but that's you apparently dude do you know how many times I listened to that Final Fantasy 16 uh boss battle music
[27:15.13]And it's like... Would you say your favorite genre of music is video game music?
[27:28.29]No.
[27:31.78]Somebody just said pick a better game?
[27:34.68]What are you talking about?
[27:36.65]What do you mean pick a better game?
[27:37.75]This one or Final Fantasy XVI?
[27:39.31]What are you talking about?
[27:42.46]What do you mean by that?
[27:43.64]Explain it.
[27:49.58]And then he did a Kappa face.
[27:51.92]Wait, is that a different person?
[27:59.15]No, that was a different person.
[27:59.99]That was a different orange name.
[28:01.94]They said both.
[28:06.37]Alright, alright, inflammatory Ivan.
[28:17.49]uh what do I want to do this if this thing is so random what do you mean oh no I guess these are albums why are you calling people out now
[28:48.49]I don't know.
[28:50.55]I'm not calling anybody out.
[28:51.61]I'm just saying... Oh, I did say explain that.
[28:55.94]Did they explain it?
[29:01.59]Dude, there's a... Holy shit, there's a Lububu Dubai chocolate chatter in my chat.
[29:07.29]Holy shit, dude.
[29:08.96]That's a celebrity.
[29:10.92]Really?
[29:11.46]You laugh, but that is a celebrity.
[29:33.91]I'm going to put him in a tournament.
[29:35.34]I want to see how he does.
[29:42.56]Oh wait, I want to see the new move he got.
[29:44.37]He got a new move.
[29:51.61]Oh.
[29:52.89]Are you serious, dude?
[29:56.12]Tournament over.
[30:00.82]Look at how much this costs to do this with that force.
[30:03.92]Tournament over.
[30:12.35]When's the next?
[30:16.80]Let's put him in this one.
[30:17.46]I think you can do it.
[30:19.16]Generating now.
[30:25.25]Here is the big moment.
[30:29.15]Big moment.
[30:40.49]And then he'll get stats from this if he wins.
[30:44.81]Uh-oh.
[30:47.01]He does not seem happy about his monster pull.
[30:49.11]I don't know.
[30:49.49]I wonder what it is.
[30:52.06]He didn't pass the vibe check.
[30:56.80]Why not?
[31:00.57]It's the, like, cube centipede.
[31:05.67]Cool.
[31:06.59]What are you going to name him?
[31:10.95]I don't know.
[31:11.35]This guy kind of sucks.
[31:13.69]Did you get bad stat rolls?
[31:16.23]I don't know what is good, but it doesn't look high.
[31:19.78]Any... At a base level, anything over 1... 1e to like 150 is pretty good.
[31:27.09]Okay, there is... Speed and life are over 120.
[31:31.97]That is it.
[31:34.10]That's good.
[31:35.18]I mean, that's not terrible.
[31:36.68]I mean, that is actually pretty terrible, but he might get stats higher.
[31:42.95]He might scale higher.
[31:55.91]Yeah, it's dumb.
[31:59.12]That is real dumb.
[32:00.79]What is it for power?
[32:03.89]I don't know.
[32:08.22]What song is that from?
[32:11.37]I picked Cool Lateralist for the album.
[32:14.93]That's a good one.
[32:19.90]I was thinking about doing... It's on that album.
[32:27.07]It is.
[32:28.27]So I'm glad I didn't pick it because... Because you would have got this.
[32:34.12]The worm.
[32:38.77]Honestly, a terrible monster.
[32:41.54]Yeah.
[32:42.58]Hey, you can make it work.
[32:52.69]Who's participating in the tournament?
[33:10.44]I think it's going to be probably like six or seven of us.
[33:12.48]It's not going to be a whole lot.
[33:14.19]How do I freeze them?
[33:15.97]Go to lab and there's a freeze.
[33:20.89]Is there an execute?
[33:23.75]There's a delete.
[33:25.48]There's a delete?
[33:26.48]Yeah, that's sad though.
[33:30.44]He's actually pretty smart on his own.
[33:33.67]I've got high hopes for Yermit here.
[33:36.57]He's actually pretty smart.
[33:38.51]The other guy has high int and he's dumb, so I don't understand that.
[33:46.17]Wait, don't listen to anything I'm saying.
[33:50.09]I haven't been.
[33:57.23]So far, it's me, you, Poke, Vinny, Squeaks, and Etalyx, and Kryken, I think, are the other that are going to do it.
[34:07.89]That's all that are available so far.
[34:10.63]I don't want to invite a bunch of people, though, because, number one, like you said earlier, in a jokey way, but in a non-jokey way, hey, go play Monster Rancher 2 for like six hours.
[34:21.28]It's like, I don't think so, man.
[34:23.62]and um after having 24 streamers in the House Flipper tournament I I definitely don't want to do that many people again so uh we ain't doing that again I'm sticking with like the 10-ish area from now on that's valid I mean this one's easier too because you don't need us all there on the day so people can do it whenever
[34:48.77]Yeah, but I think it's fun to have people there to like be able to sit there in the corner and talk shit and it's more fun that way than me just being like, oh, I beat Squeaks.
[35:02.30]Which I'm going to, right?
[35:03.90]Like, let's be honest.
[35:17.42]Too much effort, too unfocused.
[35:19.18]Wasn't there to see.
[35:19.99]What do you mean?
[35:22.17]Well, I just mean, it was difficult to try to find the time and place to get 24 people to show up to do the House Flipper thing.
[35:28.66]Because everybody's got different stuff going on.
[35:30.18]I feel like that was, hey, do the tournament.
[35:34.46]This is, hey, do the tournament, but also, you've got to play this game for like a week.
[35:45.50]So we'll just start with, let's start small.
[35:47.57]Honestly, it was originally just going to be the four of us.
[35:51.25]And I was like, wait a minute, there could be more other people and it might be fun.
[35:57.34]Look, if everyone's like, hey, that was awesome.
[35:58.88]That was like the most fun thing we've ever done ever.
[36:00.72]That was incredible.
[36:01.82]Okay, then maybe we'll do it another time with like 10.
[36:07.11]I have a feeling.
[36:08.72]at Billy Eilish Bad Guy is going to give me literally the baddest monster, as in good, like the bad guy.
[36:18.34]Is Bad Guy one of your favorite songs of all time?
[36:23.39]No.
[36:23.79]Then you are disqualified from using that monster.
[36:27.65]Well, you used the Kermit one.
[36:29.82]I told you Rainbow Connection is one of my favorite songs of all time.
[36:32.82]That's how this works.
[36:40.97]Yeah, but there's like, everything I type in, it's not showing up.
[36:43.47]Dude, Yermit is going to... Yermit is going to get... It's over for everybody.
[36:47.48]Yermit is so good.
[36:48.70]It's not even going to be close.
[36:57.04]I'm just curious.
[36:57.69]I'm not going to use it, but I need to know.
[36:59.19]I, for some reason, need to know.
[37:01.51]Yeah, I mean, you can just... The bad guy.
[37:03.63]You can just do it for fun.
[37:04.57]No, it's not on here.
[37:05.81]There's no way.
[37:11.29]there's no way I don't know is it not on there try the album it's it it's the album might I don't know what the name of it would be but if I can't literally do bad guy then yeah no nothing's on this
[37:27.28]Remember, it's PS2.
[37:28.30]They ported, I think, the whole list from when it was PS2.
[37:31.76]And they did add some stuff, I think, because some stuff on there, why would it be impossible?
[37:36.47]Like, Stylo from the Gorillas is on there that came out after the PlayStation 2.
[37:41.01]But I don't know.
[37:42.26]I don't know how they did it.
[37:45.08]I don't know.
[37:59.08]This is impossible without a full tier list.
[38:07.39]Dude, that's why you fight.
[38:09.94]And people were saying, why don't you just skip all fighting and just train?
[38:13.76]Why don't you just train, train, train?
[38:15.70]That is why you don't do that.
[38:17.64]Because that is a monstrous increase.
[38:23.23]Very happy about that performance.
[38:28.23]As long as you win.
[38:29.03]They have the rat's birthday song on there.
[38:39.03]No, they don't.
[38:43.68]It'd be cool if you could manually update the database.
[38:45.60]Yeah, that would be kind of cool if they had updates for it.
[38:50.03]I have to imagine they kind of just... I don't think they want to put very much more time into this game in particular.
[38:55.66]They kind of released it 25 years ago and then ported it.
[39:02.50]I think it's good where it is, though.
[39:04.16]I mean, it is what it is.
[39:19.36]Okay, what do I got for time on this guy?
[39:23.56]I got six months.
[39:29.29]When's the next fight?
[39:32.41]I think he could do... I think he could do this, and this would be an insane increase if I do.
[39:37.38]I might get like 30 plus stat points for this.
[39:40.38]But he might die, which would be bad.
[40:02.39]You know where I'm going to stop, right?
[40:08.28]You know the number that we're stopping at here.
[40:12.55]He's huge now.
[40:13.35]He was so little.
[40:13.97]He was like this tall.
[40:17.64]And I'm going to give him what he likes this month.
[40:20.52]He likes potatoes.
[40:21.73]I'm going to give it to him.
[40:36.49]Okay, let's prepare him because I feel like he can handle C. Oh, no.
[40:50.50]Oh, God.
[40:53.64]Uh-oh.
[40:59.27]He's...
[41:00.66]gonna die soon uh should I just let him rest for six months I need to make sure he doesn't die in this two-year span did I rush him did I push him too hard oh shit uh okay dude I did too many he didn't no he didn't take too many of these he's alright
[41:31.73]um my second monster is is what does skill do uh skill is your chance to hit and skill is directly countered by speed speed is your chance to avoid being hit
[41:54.68]so if you let's let's just say for instance that's like a basic math problem let's say that you had 200 skill and I had 200 speed they would kind of even each other out I don't know the exact math but it's it's along those lines why are you saying that oh because there's that really high skill and speed but it's like a little
[42:24.36]A little nobody.
[42:28.12]Skill and speed are arguably the hardest things to trade up because they're not main stats.
[42:36.65]You know, like power, int.
[42:39.04]I would say defense is a main stat too, but defense, that kind of sucks.
[42:46.34]He rolled a god monster.
[42:48.13]Look out.
[42:49.25]What do you mean?
[42:49.63]What do you mean he rolled a god monster?
[42:53.57]I rolled...
[42:55.14]God.
[42:56.24]Himself.
[43:00.47]It's alright, Yarmouth the dino has got this under control.
[43:07.50]Okay, I need to make sure he stays alive, so we're gonna feed him like a cake.
[43:16.43]Oh, he didn't like it!
[43:18.07]Oh shit!
[43:18.71]He ate it!
[43:20.40]Oh no!
[43:24.18]Oh, I just like took years off his life again.
[43:26.70]Okay, rest again.
[43:29.59]And then we're going to do a little bit more training and then I'm going to take it very, very easy on you.
[43:42.50]Okay, he's fine.
[43:44.00]I don't think I'm going to do any more air entries or any more battling, which... Do you think he can handle it?
[43:53.44]Oh, by the way, sorry, I realize I'm probably just talking over your stream right now, aren't I?
[43:58.65]I should just mute.
[44:02.48]Okay, I'm muted.
[44:03.72]So now I'm not just speaking over Ster's stream.
[44:11.21]He muted you already?
[44:14.51]Well, I muted him too, so whatever.
[44:17.18]Okay.
[44:18.80]If I bring him to C, I might get a massive stat increase.
[44:23.58]But if he gets KO'd, he might die.
[44:31.57]I think I'm just gonna keep this up.
[44:33.22]None of this should really hurt him.
[44:43.95]Bad guy is in the database.
[44:45.20]It's in an album.
[44:51.17]They unfollowed each other on Twitter.
[44:53.27]I unfollowed him like four years ago.
[44:56.60]Like maybe eight years ago.
[45:07.79]Dude, I haven't used my tweet.
[45:09.59]I said this before, but it's so funny that my last tweet is from 2023 and it's me retweeting DougDougShuffleMania.
[45:17.42]And like I said, that's good.
[45:20.08]I'm happy about that.
[45:28.36]I need nut oil.
[45:35.29]It's okay, we re-followed each other on Blue Sky.
[45:37.82]Oh, I didn't tell you that part.
[45:38.94]Yeah, we re-followed each other.
[45:51.53]Alright, one more run drill and he should be good.
[46:08.94]And then I'll take a look at him, see what is priority.
[46:18.83]Maybe I just keep doing life.
[46:21.88]This is safe.
[46:22.54]It's not gonna hurt him.
[46:23.48]He's not gonna die from doing this.
[46:28.65]And I'll just rest him every two weeks.
[46:31.67]Dude, I could get over probably 500 fucking health.
[46:44.25]What do you think?
[46:46.19]Send him to C and get a bunch of stat increases if I win.
[46:48.84]Or just run till I get 500 HP.
[46:59.94]Send him to C.
[47:15.91]Wait, what day is it?
[47:22.29]Is it?
[47:23.62]That's funny.
[47:25.88]Alright, I think he can handle it.
[47:27.78]I think he can handle it.
[47:29.00]I'm ready.
[47:29.36]I'm willing to because I think we'll get a ton of points for this.
[47:32.95]No, I can't do it.
[47:38.55]I can't do it.
[47:39.33]He might die.
[47:45.00]I'm just going to keep running.
[47:58.21]We want Beanbag Sonic.
[48:00.72]That's not the rules of the tournament.
[48:06.16]You would love Uma Musume.
[48:10.69]I probably would.
[48:13.11]I love games where you just kind of upgrade, upgrade, upgrade.
[48:20.10]I mean, I'm not going to stream it, though.
[48:23.42]I thought about it the first two or three days it was out, and there was a ton of hype around it.
[48:43.47]I have no horse in this race, but Blue Sky and Twitter suck ass in their own ways.
[48:50.02]Guys, the only social media that I use is this.
[48:53.61]This is my social media.
[48:56.25]Right now, I'm posting every second.
[49:02.22]This is how I use social media.
[49:03.95]It's right here.
[49:19.27]I'm getting over 500 health and I'm going to wow everybody at the tournament.
[49:23.09]I was, you know.
[49:31.04]Dude, 500 HP.
[49:44.51]Blue sky is dead.
[49:45.15]Nobody takes it seriously.
[49:48.16]What is the next thing that's going to come along that everyone wants to get on?
[49:52.14]I don't know.
[49:53.44]It's impossible to tell.
[50:03.34]Something will come along and everyone's like, oh, that's where all of us are going to be now.
[50:09.90]And you know what?
[50:10.34]It might not even exist yet.
[50:31.05]It's probably best we don't all use it.
[50:35.76]Why don't you know about Glorp Book?
[50:53.14]Cool.
[50:58.44]You ever used a CD for a monster?
[50:59.76]Which one was the best?
[51:00.90]There was... I forget what it was, but I think... Was it Monster Rancher 1?
[51:05.25]There was a monster that had $9.99 in every stat, right?
[51:08.08]From a certain CD.
[51:08.90]I feel like it was a Capcom game or something.
[51:12.51]Like, what was it?
[51:14.03]What was it from?
[51:14.85]It's a very specific game or CD.
[51:27.43]It was Monster Rancher 1 and Monster Rancher 2.
[51:34.42]Oh, if you use Monster Rancher itself, you get a strong monster, but it will die in two weeks.
[51:42.03]I feel like we got something good from Big Mama's house, too.
[51:44.07]I feel like I remember being excited.
[51:48.34]Alright, let's rest.
[51:52.26]Let's check in with Ster.
[51:54.47]Uh, Ster, how you doing?
[51:55.45]Just checking in, seeing how things are going.
[51:59.36]Do you have any questions about the game?
[52:05.31]I think he actually has me hard muted on his end.
[52:14.90]You trying to talk to me?
[52:15.82]I just said, how you doing?
[52:18.40]Do you have any questions or anything?
[52:20.68]I'm picking music.
[52:22.60]My first two were bad.
[52:23.61]Like a lot is riding on this.
[52:25.41]Okay.
[52:27.91]Well, back to it.
[52:29.43]Carry on.
[52:41.29]Oops.
[52:43.67]Alright, so I got four months.
[53:01.96]Getting there.
[53:10.78]You know, I don't think in the 30 years, or 25 plus years, I've come back to this game many, many times.
[53:19.10]I don't think I've ever had a monster that had 500 health, but we're doing it now.
[53:28.46]Now what would be really funny is if somebody actually one-hit KO'd him from full health and this idea was a complete wash and it meant nothing.
[53:40.91]Which I think is actually still possible.
[53:42.82]I think that can actually still happen.
[53:52.57]I wanted to play this game as a kid, but the box art threw me off.
[53:55.74]Yeah, it is kind of weird.
[53:56.64]It's a Swayzo going with his mouth open and out.
[54:01.03]It's a weird box art.
[54:02.05]It is.
[54:02.29]I agree.
[54:03.45]I can see that.
[54:10.94]Oh, damn.
[54:12.06]That's the first crit.
[54:14.25]Only worth 13?
[54:15.23]It's because he's almost dead.
[54:18.51]Maybe I should stop training him.
[54:20.53]And just let him rest and feed him stuff he likes?
[54:29.63]Okay, I'm gonna give him potato.
[54:30.77]Wait, does he still like potatoes?
[54:35.23]Shit.
[54:36.32]I think he does.
[54:46.47]I just tuned in.
[54:47.17]Why did you get me?
[54:47.85]Why did I get an ad?
[54:51.11]Uh, oh, I haven't run ads in, like, a few hours, I think.
[54:59.12]Ads on the co-op streams, they're just too hard to run and take breaks on, because I don't want to impede on what we're doing.
[55:04.81]Okay.
[55:16.22]I'm gonna rest him again.
[55:27.22]How many people in the Monster Rancher universe do you think eat the monsters?
[55:37.03]How many monsters in the Monster Rancher universe eat the humans?
[55:40.54]That's a better question.
[55:54.31]This one definitely does.
[55:55.55]Oh, I would imagine.
[55:56.53]Absolutely.
[56:02.93]Okay, last one and then we're gonna take good care of them.
[56:17.93]Would you eat them?
[56:18.83]No, I don't think so.
[56:29.90]Uh, this is on Steam.
[56:31.72]Monster Rancher 1 and 2 DX.
[56:39.85]There it is.
[56:40.25]500 health.
[56:49.35]Okay.
[56:52.75]I got two more months.
[56:54.23]Let's plan this out.
[57:00.78]That speed is already good.
[57:02.30]It's just he doesn't really hit very hard.
[57:04.68]And he's kind of dumb.
[57:06.22]I think I want Int up.
[57:08.65]Because you can only defend against Int moves with Int.
[57:14.99]Maybe I should try to get this at like 130?
[57:16.39]140?
[57:17.60]Because if somebody rolls through here with an Int monster, it doesn't matter how much health I have.
[57:26.92]Too late for Int.
[57:31.75]What should I do?
[57:32.23]Maybe speed and defense?
[57:33.51]Just to get him up?
[57:34.79]Speed and skill?
[57:35.63]Or maybe power.
[57:40.38]Power and life.
[57:43.50]Lean into power.
[57:50.13]I'm going to lose speed on this, though, but it's alright.
[58:00.26]I think I'm not going to do any more hard drills after this, though.
[58:04.65]If it's too hard on him, he might die.
[58:07.33]Oh my god, that's... He can handle it, right?
[58:20.85]Let's give him tablets, just to make sure the last week of training here, the last few weeks is good.
[58:30.67]Get speed back over 200, that's true.
[58:47.31]Another one?
[58:48.41]This was always so awesome when this happened.
[58:52.57]The double sail?
[58:54.86]In the base game, this is huge.
[59:02.77]Alright, I'm gonna... Let's do nut oil.
[59:07.71]I'm gonna do that power one one more time.
[59:11.42]And then we're gonna get speed up.
[59:13.60]Rest.
[59:16.90]And he'll be good to go.
[59:21.11]Alright, just one more.
[59:21.79]You can do it.
[59:28.36]I love how he wiggles his butt.
[59:30.38]So funny.
[59:36.11]Nice.
[59:37.48]Okay.
[59:38.90]I'm happy about this.
[59:39.88]I think he's actually gonna be the one to win it all.
[59:48.96]Okay.
[59:50.54]We're almost done with this month.
[60:05.95]Need to play risk tier again.
[60:07.81]Didn't I beat it?
[60:10.11]I beat the game, didn't I?
[60:12.04]I guess it was a long time ago.
[60:22.09]OK, Buster.
[60:22.77]Oh, he's back.
[60:25.21]Hello, how's it going?
[60:27.43]I got my guys.
[60:28.31]My third ones OK, OK?
[60:32.68]I'll train him on Monday, maybe.
[60:35.06]OK, yeah.
[60:37.13]if you're not going to fast forward it will take about an hour or two to get to year two but I would say take your time with it a game you know the game's fun it's fun to like see what you and don't shy away from tournaments just because you have unlimited money it's not just money uh yeah it's fun says you because you got like what let me look at your monster I'm cheating
[61:07.46]You got like a giant dinosaur man.
[61:10.18]What are you talking about?
[61:12.36]The yellow fella.
[61:15.03]Alright, how much time do I got?
[61:21.98]I got... Are you leaving or what are you doing?
[61:25.38]I'm probably going to end soon.
[61:28.47]I think I'm going to because I barely got any sleep.
[61:31.91]Yeah, you should probably get some sleep, dude.
[61:34.76]Um, I just forgot how to play this game.
[61:37.20]I should like learn how to play this game on one of the shitty characters that I've rolled.
[61:41.77]And then like, train this one decently.
[61:43.99]Honestly, just, even just starting a new save file and just playing the game is worth it, I would say.
[61:52.66]Because it'll get you, you'll start to remember, the items will trickle in, you can read stuff.
[61:56.00]It's not just like, here's two million dollars and every monster.
[61:59.77]Just start with something default and just relearn the game.
[62:02.96]And by the way, your monster ain't gonna do what he just did.
[62:14.32]Yeah, I'm gonna do it Monday.
[62:16.28]Okay.
[62:16.40]I think.
[62:17.42]So I'll see you.
[62:18.97]Thanks.
[62:19.23]See you later, dude.
[62:20.09]Before hanging out and playing games.
[62:21.87]It was fun.
[62:22.63]It was fun.
[62:24.79]Best of luck with the yellow fella.
[62:26.70]Thanks, dude.
[62:29.80]See ya.
[62:32.95]Alright, he's gone.
[62:35.81]Okay, I got one more month and then we got one more guy to train up.
[62:44.92]Okay, and we'll sing his birthday song.
[62:46.99]So it's three weeks from here.
[62:49.37]Okay, so I gotta make sure I get this right.
[62:54.04]Let's go nut oil.
[62:57.54]Good.
[63:05.01]And let's do... I think I'm just gonna do speed.
[63:10.31]I don't think I can do any more hard drills because I feel like he'll die.
[63:19.44]Good.
[63:20.20]He hasn't failed very many of these either.
[63:21.39]I've had monsters before that failed half of them.
[63:24.73]I feel bad for the person that is gonna get unlucky and have their monster fail everything.
[63:30.05]It's gonna be sad because they're gonna lose.
[63:47.64]Does the food you feed them affect success?
[63:51.52]Maybe it does.
[63:52.26]I don't know.
[63:54.37]The Gemini pots I have are... Don't you have to use them, though?
[63:58.35]Is it just being in the inventory?
[63:59.55]Is it... Yeah, I haven't... I actually probably should tell people not to use these.
[64:07.46]But... Hey.
[64:09.63]Let's be real.
[64:11.17]Everybody else needs all the help they can get.
[64:12.69]So... Go ahead.
[64:15.30]Okay.
[64:15.42]Okay.
[64:29.42]What do they do?
[64:30.16]I think they... somebody said they're passive.
[64:34.99]What happens if you drink them?
[64:48.54]Yeah, legendcup.com has tons of resources if people really want to actually really do some training.
[64:56.30]But it's just gonna be fun to see, uh, like Vinny KO Ster his monster in one punch and Ster, uh, like, karate chop his table in half.
[65:05.17]You know what I mean?
[65:05.65]That's what we're here for.
[65:24.90]One more week?
[65:27.57]I think we've got one more week, so... Oh man, this is low.
[65:33.96]That's low.
[65:34.48]I'm gonna do that.
[65:39.74]What is it?
[65:40.12]Shoot, yeah.
[65:50.30]I would be happy if that got up 10 points from where it is.
[65:56.49]I'm more than happy.
[66:04.68]Okay, he's tired.
[66:05.51]Oh, we got a raid from Ster!
[66:10.85]What's up, Ster?
[66:12.40]What's up?
[66:15.08]Welcome, guys.
[66:16.60]I'm about to end, too, after this.
[66:19.35]And I know you just came from Ster's stream, but...
[66:24.91]Oh, don't leak this.
[66:26.81]This is leakable material.
[66:28.06]Take a look at this guy.
[66:33.38]Don't leak this.
[66:34.75]But... Good luck, Ster.
[66:46.04]Okay, I want to do nut oil.
[66:50.33]I need one more nut oil.
[66:55.99]And I'll do skill one more time and I think that'd be fine.
[66:59.16]Oh, by the way, Ster viewers.
[67:09.18]Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side?
[67:20.62]Rainbows are visions, but only illusions.
[67:26.57]And rainbows have best song in the world!
[67:30.30]Did I even feed it to him?
[67:40.76]No.
[67:50.45]It is a fantastic Willie Nelson version, you should listen to it.
[67:54.35]Hey!
[67:54.51]That's what was available for me to pick!
[68:00.24]That's already from my chat, I think.
[68:05.27]Alright, this is the last training drill, and oh, look at how far he's grown.
[68:09.67]No!
[68:19.07]Don't do that on your last drill.
[68:21.53]Okay, fine.
[68:22.32]It's a cheat day.
[68:23.04]That's fine.
[68:27.80]No, we're not going to get mad at him.
[68:29.37]He's fine.
[68:37.82]Everybody get ready to sing.
[68:57.95]It's funny because to get the dog to sit like this for the camera, for the video, somebody behind the camera is just holding a bag of treats and lifting the bag up and down.
[69:20.09]Have your cake.
[69:29.17]He's so cool.
[69:30.03]Okay.
[69:35.52]That is it.
[69:38.24]I think I got a pretty good team so far.
[69:42.41]So I got a high... He's not that strong, though.
[69:47.42]I'm concerned about this.
[69:49.20]I'm concerned about this.
[69:51.94]And I'm not that concerned about this, but I am kind of.
[69:56.13]I'm concerned about this.
[69:59.12]One laser beam to the face and this gets cut in half.
[70:01.87]And he gets destroyed.
[70:06.41]Alright, let's go look at the other one we got.
[70:12.12]But hey, Ster, thanks for the raid.
[70:13.43]Welcome, Ster Chatters.
[70:30.64]So who was it?
[70:35.81]Was it Little Guy?
[70:36.93]No, wait, it was Butt-Chug, wasn't it?
[70:43.92]We can't use Little Guy or Miku Crab.
[70:46.81]We have to use Butt-Chug.
[70:51.41]Oh, wait, no, this is, yeah, this is... That's fine.
[71:05.59]Alright, now, here's my plan.
[71:07.80]The first monster is high int, but not that high int.
[71:12.42]He's kind of balanced around int, skill, and speed, right?
[71:16.17]Second monster is pretty high life.
[71:19.09]I think I'm going to just do as much int as possible.
[71:23.62]Try to get him a heavy tech, and this is my one-hit KO guy.
[71:31.21]Swayzo sucks.
[71:32.87]That's fine.
[71:33.33]I'm going to get him the laser eye thing.
[71:36.06]And I'm going to go for one hit KOs.
[71:40.94]I'm not going to train life, speed, anything.
[71:45.01]I'm only going to train int and skill.
[71:47.13]And that's it.
[71:51.00]He just needs to get one move off.
[71:52.84]And it's all AI versus AI.
[71:55.12]So if he's smart enough to do the laser eye thing, he'll kill everybody in one hit.
[72:01.15]Why is he so small?
[72:02.07]Because he's a baby.
[72:12.76]Why is his name Achug?
[72:14.20]Alright, I think that's good.
[72:20.28]I am done for now.
[72:22.04]We got one more guy to train.
[72:23.95]Should be able to do it in like an hour or two.
[72:28.35]That was a fun day though.
[72:29.09]I feel like there's a lot happened today.
[72:31.55]I'm just going to go play that other game, I think.
[72:33.66]That game is awesome.
[72:35.32]He is coming.
[72:36.56]That game is amazing.
[72:46.78]But that was a good time.
[72:49.42]You should raid Poke.
[72:50.14]Is Poke still going?
[72:51.24]Poke is still alive.
[72:56.69]Yeah, we can raid Poke.
[72:58.57]What's Poke doing right now?
[73:07.43]Superliminal?
[73:09.21]Oh, that's a good one.
[73:10.33]I'm gonna send you to Poke.
[73:12.84]Go chill with Poke.
[73:14.12]Go say hello.
[73:21.59]Okay.
[73:24.81]And I'll see you later.
[73:25.45]I probably won't be live tomorrow?
[73:27.17]What's today?
[73:30.14]I'll be live midweek.
[73:31.83]Maybe like Wednesday-ish.
[73:33.43]Tuesday or Wednesday.
[73:35.53]Plan on Wednesday, Thursday.
[73:37.41]Yeah, we'll be live Wednesday.
[73:39.75]There might be a surprise stream in the middle there somewhere, but I don't know.
[73:43.10]We'll see.
[73:43.48]But Wednesday at least.
[73:47.18]Because I do want to get the training done.
[73:48.68]Me and Sterney need to play Baldur's Gate still.
[73:53.41]Dark Alliance.
[73:55.29]I still want to finish that.
[74:07.96]Yeah, I'll see you later.
[74:15.95]Have a good one.
[74:16.83]Take care of yourselves.
[74:17.93]I'm ending the stream at like 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
[74:20.01]This is crazy.
[74:22.38]It's kind of nice, actually.
[74:25.62]The whole day is still ahead of me.
[74:31.60]Alright, see you later.
[74:32.67]Take care.
[74:33.95]See you next time.
[74:36.17]And goodbye.
[74:49.47]you
[75:24.35]Thank you.
