[ve:60.16.100]

[00:09.16]Hey, what's going on, guys?
[00:10.24]Jerma here with a live commentary.
[00:12.84]Just want to go over a couple of things.
[00:14.16]I want to talk about the new changes to the existing items and how they changed them and what I think about it.
[00:20.83]I am really, really excited.
[00:21.97]I'm so happy about some of these new changes, guys.
[00:24.79]As you see there, I'm using the Widowmaker, which is the new... I don't want to say new, because that's not really true.
[00:30.96]It's the new-ish shotgun, and they find... Oh, my God, I'm going to... Look at what I just did.
[00:36.34]Going on an absolute tangent.
[00:37.66]Oh, my God, there's a sentry.
[00:39.26]I just killed three people.
[00:40.68]Well, two people with an assist.
[00:42.34]And I didn't have to reload, and I had a million shots.
[00:44.88]It was amazing.
[00:46.66]This new gun, what they did, let me tell you.
[00:48.93]If you're unaware, they made the Widowmaker.
[00:51.17]I'll show you.
[00:51.97]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[00:55.85]You can now shoot this gun six times with 200 metal.
[01:00.23]And even if you miss, if you miss once or twice, it's okay.
[01:04.39]You're probably going to be able to get seven or eight shots with this thing if you miss a couple times.
[01:09.52]It's a great, great change.
[01:11.02]Oh my god, I'm going to get killed.
[01:13.08]See this?
[01:13.46]Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[01:19.84]I just shot the gun nine times without any reloads.
[01:23.34]That's more than the... What's the heavy one called?
[01:25.67]The heavy shotgun...
[01:27.34]The family business.
[01:28.48]That's more shots than the family business.
[01:30.26]The family business has eight.
[01:31.92]And you have to reload it.
[01:33.72]Unbelievable change.
[01:34.82]Hopefully, I'm going to try and go on some kind of tangent here.
[01:37.39]I'm not even putting my sentry gun down.
[01:39.19]I'm being a real idiot.
[01:41.39]Oh, this is awesome.
[01:42.67]I'm so glad they did this.
[01:45.80]Oh, backstab.
[01:49.91]So let me try this one more time before I go into the other items.
[01:52.81]This is awesome.
[01:54.05]I'm so excited that they did this.
[01:55.21]Because now I can unequip the Frontier Justice for a while and use this.
[01:59.45]I'm not going to say completely goodbye to the Frontier Justice, but at least for a while.
[02:03.66]Because they added this.
[02:04.80]This is so awesome!
[02:07.44]Okay, where... There's a Sentry over there.
[02:10.18]Oh my word.
[02:12.48]Let's see if I can pull this off.
[02:15.98]There we go.
[02:17.27]Now notice how I have more metal than when I started with.
[02:19.77]What just even happened?
[02:21.91]So I shot, I put down a Mini-Sentry, I shot that Demoman two or three times, and I got back 40 metal.
[02:29.19]I'm pretty sure that it still gives you back 60 metal.
[02:32.54]So you shoot for 30 and you get back 60 if you land all the pellets on somebody.
[02:37.80]So instead of before where you kind of was one for one, one for one, let's see here.
[02:42.08]Oh, maybe not.
[02:42.62]It's 30 for 30.
[02:43.70]Okay.
[02:44.64]That's still fine.
[02:45.52]That's still awesome.
[02:46.32]I'm cool with that.
[02:48.75]So I'm just so happy about this.
[02:50.33]Oh, they still have a teleporter up.
[02:52.16]Nice.
[02:53.84]Oh, let's not reload one time and just keep shooting this guy.
[02:56.99]Are you kidding me?
[02:57.69]Why is he not dying?
[03:00.89]What the hell is going on?
[03:01.87]Are you serious?
[03:03.78]I haven't reloaded what's I have been pretty good at what I think that you can read why is this not being destroyed are you serious what that that that that that that that why could I not destroy that teleport what the hell is that okay I want to count after I'm done with this I'm going to count I think I shot like thirty rounds in a row
[03:31.71]Okay, but don't ask me why that teleporter didn't go down.
[03:34.39]The engineer must have been on the other side repairing it.
[03:36.77]Because that was pretty ridiculous.
[03:38.09]I'm not going to lie.
[03:39.01]That was pretty ridiculous.
[03:39.97]I think that's a spy.
[03:42.96]Maybe not.
[03:44.40]No, it's not.
[03:46.96]I think there's a sentry over there.
[03:49.20]No.
[03:51.42]So you guys get the idea.
[03:52.50]I'm going to move on to the other items.
[03:53.99]Maybe see if I can get one more kill.
[03:55.47]Nope.
[03:56.41]I'm going to move on to the pyro and see if we can get something to happen with the pyro.
[03:59.49]Oh, nice black screen.
[04:01.33]So now, take a look at this.
[04:03.85]The Reserve Shooter, you can now use it on the Pyro.
[04:06.55]Very, very cool.
[04:08.43]So let's see.
[04:09.65]I'm going to use the Degreaser to get the fast switch.
[04:13.66]So essentially, what you want to try and do is you want to blast somebody in the air, switch over real quick, and get the mini crits.
[04:20.62]I am going to love this, guys, because if you know how I play Pyro, I play only pretty much with the shotgun.
[04:25.98]Where did that spy go?
[04:27.18]Because he's around here.
[04:27.90]I could test it out on him.
[04:30.12]Oh, well.
[04:30.74]Well, I can test it out on this dude over here.
[04:33.82]Heavy right here.
[04:34.54]Let's see if I can get behind him or screw around with him.
[04:37.05]See if this works.
[04:40.69]Oh, it worked, but just not enough damage.
[04:44.41]Oh, this is ridiculous.
[04:46.13]So I'm going to really like this.
[04:48.03]I probably shouldn't have gone after that heavy.
[04:49.77]Actually, what am I doing?
[04:50.35]Why did I light him on fire?
[04:52.34]They don't have to be on fire.
[04:54.30]They just have to be in the air.
[04:55.64]Okay, I don't know.
[04:56.54]I'm kind of freaking out about that right now.
[04:58.96]I shouldn't have lit them on fire.
[04:59.98]I should have just blown them in the air just to confuse them.
[05:01.72]Because, yeah, it's just when they're in the air, when you switch over.
[05:05.82]Now, I wish they added the Engineer.
[05:07.52]I mean, obviously, they changed the Engineer a little bit, but oh, my God.
[05:11.88]Oh, boy.
[05:13.84]Can I... Oh, my God.
[05:19.31]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[05:22.07]Nothing up here, right?
[05:24.53]Did I get him?
[05:26.09]Sort of.
[05:27.68]Sort of.
[05:30.12]You do only get the three shots, but I'm not concerned about that.
[05:32.66]I should be fine with that.
[05:36.54]Oh, that was awesome.
[05:39.68]Oh, I could have just critted.
[05:40.60]Oh, come on.
[05:44.98]Oh, damn it.
[05:46.08]I'm freaking out too much about trying to get people in the air.
[05:50.31]I need to just play Pyro.
[05:51.41]Obviously I don't play Pyro that often.
[05:53.49]But when I do play Pyro, I use the shotgun.
[05:56.03]So this should be a really interesting setup.
[05:57.39]I'm going to try it one more time because I don't want this to really drag on.
[05:59.79]So I'm going to try this one more time and see what happens.
[06:03.55]Yeah, very, very exciting.
[06:05.12]And one of the other changes I'm going to show you guys, one of the new changes they added, but they didn't really talk about it.
[06:10.30]And not very many people are talking about it, is they nerfed into the ground.
[06:14.30]Okay, here we go.
[06:16.20]There we go.
[06:17.78]It's not doing a whole lot of damage.
[06:21.75]Usually a point-blank shot like that, that mini-crit, that should have killed him.
[06:26.14]Try this one more time.
[06:27.34]Oh, actually, no.
[06:28.16]Not going to be able to.
[06:28.76]I'm going to try it one more time.
[06:31.64]But something that nobody really talks about is they nerfed the Shortstop.
[06:36.82]They made it 50% slower for reload.
[06:39.18]We might be even changing maps.
[06:40.87]And if we do, yeah, I'll see you guys in two seconds.
[06:45.17]Okay, we are back.
[06:46.87]And we are on upward now.
[06:48.27]I actually changed service because that one was going to a weird map that I didn't really know.
[06:52.50]So... I'm going to show you guys.
[06:54.64]I'm going to try and get a kill with this to try and demonstrate it.
[06:58.66]Obviously, if you've seen my previous live commentaries, you know that I'm pretty much a monkey in a box when it comes to trying to play and livecom at the same time.
[07:07.39]Don't know what that analogy even really means, but I just kind of made it up.
[07:11.43]Oh, come on.
[07:11.81]Do that again.
[07:12.41]Do it again.
[07:13.97]Oh...
[07:15.22]Oh my god, I'm going to die.
[07:18.34]So yeah, like I said before, if you know my live comms, you know that I pretty much cannot play and talk at the same time because my brain, at least in first person shooters, it's hard for me to do that.
[07:28.56]Oh my god.
[07:31.46]There we go.
[07:32.82]Nice.
[07:34.27]And this guy, I'm going to die.
[07:37.05]Oh, don't you jump in the air.
[07:38.59]Don't jump in the air.
[07:39.51]I got the Reserve Shooter.
[07:41.51]That was pretty cool.
[07:43.05]Alright, let's get another kill and then I'll move on.
[07:47.81]Oh, no.
[07:48.37]Damn, damn, damn.
[07:49.67]I need heals.
[07:51.43]I need to be healed.
[07:53.95]So this is very, very cool.
[07:55.19]I'm so glad that they still care about balancing the game.
[07:58.51]Even if it takes them a long time.
[08:00.11]Sometimes it takes Valve a fairly long time to balance things, and yikes.
[08:04.96]Alright, let's see if I can get behind these guys and really mess up their day.
[08:08.88]Oh, health.
[08:09.24]I'll take you and ammo.
[08:10.64]Thank you very much.
[08:13.00]What am I doing?
[08:15.03]I was like, oh, let me get behind him.
[08:16.29]Or just pretend to get behind him.
[08:17.53]Oh, jump in the air.
[08:19.03]Jump in the air.
[08:21.59]Okay.
[08:22.60]Looks like he's building a sentry.
[08:26.06]Ah, damn it!
[08:27.76]I'm in a lot of trouble.
[08:28.90]Because he's just got a sentry over there now.
[08:32.12]Maybe, oh, come on.
[08:33.02]Let's cause a little bit of confusion.
[08:34.16]Oh my god, he's back.
[08:36.80]Oh, I'm so dead.
[08:41.38]I'm so dead.
[08:42.82]I need that health.
[08:43.45]There we go.
[08:45.66]God, I'm just like the... Oh, my God.
[08:48.81]It's over for me.
[08:50.39]Come on, health spawn.
[08:51.33]I'm going to have to go around the other side.
[08:54.43]Oh, God.
[08:58.01]Can I reflect one of these rockets?
[08:59.93]Oh, God.
[09:01.25]Alright, this is it.
[09:01.83]I'm going to change to the scout just because this is kind of dragging.
[09:05.10]Oh, goodbye.
[09:07.02]The question is, can I... No, I'm screwed.
[09:10.54]Now it's over.
[09:11.10]Alright.
[09:11.34]I'm going to change to the Scout and show you guys the new change to the Scout.
[09:15.42]My God, I have to put this on.
[09:17.88]These don't really matter.
[09:20.46]Okay.
[09:21.76]So the Shortstop now, as you can see, let's see.
[09:25.74]One, two, three, four.
[09:28.48]Oh, man.
[09:29.12]Yeah, the reload speed is 50% slower.
[09:32.08]It's a nerf that nobody talked about.
[09:33.58]I'm going to see if it really, really affects gameplay.
[09:36.83]Let's see this again.
[09:39.35]Yeah, that's a lot slower.
[09:40.73]It used to be just pretty much instant.
[09:42.69]Now it's about another couple seconds.
[09:50.15]Yeah, it's slow.
[09:51.20]That's pretty damn slow.
[09:55.02]Oh, I'm going to get killed.
[09:58.52]Oh, God.
[10:00.84]Oh, I want to kill that engineer.
[10:05.44]Yeah, there's a pretty obvious difference.
[10:09.08]I don't think it's really game-changing or anything, but... God.
[10:14.22]I just got crits'd, and I didn't do anything.
[10:20.22]I've got to get rid of that sentry.
[10:24.00]There we go.
[10:24.52]I didn't even do it.
[10:28.90]Oh, no.
[10:30.00]No.
[10:31.72]Oh, you are done.
[10:33.56]Oh, reload time.
[10:34.44]You are so slow.
[10:35.22]There we go.
[10:38.99]I guess it's not too bad.
[10:39.87]A lot of... It's not as fast as it used to be, of course, but it's not terrible or anything.
[10:47.58]Oh, boy.
[10:48.26]I need to get healed or find a medic.
[10:50.26]I got milk.
[10:51.54]I got the milk.
[10:52.10]I'm fine.
[10:55.65]And... Give me that health.
[10:58.87]Give me that health.
[10:59.39]Give me that health.
[11:00.73]What?
[11:02.45]Oh!
[11:02.57]Alright, so it's not that big of a deal.
[11:07.64]I thought it was going to be terrible.
[11:08.82]It's okay.
[11:11.00]What else did they change?
[11:12.29]Obviously, besides... I have to show you this just because I have to.
[11:15.87]So here's... Look at my Heavy.
[11:18.19]Look at how ridiculous he is.
[11:23.37]Look at how stupid he looks now.
[11:25.07]I'm so glad.
[11:25.69]Look at the... Because they made the mask a miscellaneous item.
[11:29.20]So I can look like a scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz now.
[11:35.30]Alright, I'm going to just, I'm going to end it here.
[11:37.64]Just wanted to get a video out showcasing the new stuff, the new changes.
[11:41.70]Obviously, I can't go over all the hats because, I mean, hats, hats are hats.
[11:45.88]You guys know the deal about hats.
[11:47.82]So let's just end this by going on like a tirade as a heavy, as the scarecrow heavy.
[11:57.02]Oh, see you later, sentry.
[11:59.46]I need a medic.
[12:00.22]I need a medic.
[12:01.64]I don't even know why I have the shotgun equipped.
[12:03.60]I should have the sandwich equipped.
[12:06.40]Hmm.
[12:07.78]Hmm.
[12:09.36]Oh, I can get rid of you.
[12:11.14]I can get rid of you.
[12:11.86]No, I can't.
[12:13.84]Crap.
[12:15.00]Crap.
[12:15.57]Crap.
[12:16.11]Crap.
[12:16.37]Crap.
[12:16.65]Crap.
[12:17.39]Come on.
[12:18.89]And I'll get this one over here.
[12:21.83]And that engineer is... Oh, next time... Hey, next time he goes to get metal, it's all over for this century.
[12:27.98]Oh!
[12:31.64]Come on.
[12:31.88]Go get metal.
[12:33.36]Go get some metal.
[12:37.61]Oh, there's nothing you can do now.
[12:40.21]Except that soldier can kill me for sure.
[12:43.57]Oh, it's gone.
[12:47.50]Before he kills me, gimme, gimme!
[12:49.72]Alright, maybe we can actually win this.
[12:52.32]Now here we go, time to drop down.
[12:54.32]Let's get on that cot.
[12:56.36]How did I not?
[12:57.62]That was weird.
[13:00.40]There we go.
[13:01.40]There we go.
[13:04.00]Gotta get rid of you.
[13:05.42]Gotta get rid of you.
[13:10.26]What?
[13:10.60]What's going on?
[13:11.68]Oh, it's up there.
[13:15.08]No!
[13:15.44]Spy!
[13:17.34]You bastard.
[13:19.38]Get me on the cart.
[13:20.10]Get me on the cart.
[13:23.38]Oh, Gerber's going to cap it as heavy.
[13:26.00]And now we got... Okay, come on over here.
[13:27.94]Come on over.
[13:31.40]Oh, I just have to get over here.
[13:33.46]Come on.
[13:34.44]And that's all she wrote.
[13:35.58]We're going to win.
[13:36.20]That's the end.
[13:37.12]Oh, come on.
[13:40.43]Yes.
[13:41.87]Nice.
[13:42.85]Alright, guys.
[13:43.55]Thanks so much for watching.
[13:45.31]I will see you all next time.
[13:46.65]Hopefully you enjoy some of the new changes, the new hats, all the new things in the man-o, the man-o-conomy, the man-conomy anniversary.
[13:55.70]God, I can't even talk.
[13:56.78]But yeah, see you all next time.
[13:58.12]Take care, everybody.
