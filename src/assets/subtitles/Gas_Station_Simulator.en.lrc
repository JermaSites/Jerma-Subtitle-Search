[01:34.23]What do you think about the new track?
[01:37.01]This is not replacing the starting screen, by the way.
[01:39.84]I just kind of really wanted you to listen to it.
[01:46.52]I think it's great.
[01:47.18]I think it's really good.
[01:52.40]Blordow made some new things, as you can probably see.
[01:57.53]We have new sub badges.
[01:59.99]We have a bunch of new music.
[02:03.22]This is gonna be on- I got a lot.
[02:04.68]We'll go through them.
[02:05.68]Well, I- No, maybe not.
[02:08.04]Maybe you should be surprised.
[02:09.20]Time for a new season.
[02:16.85]I'm one hour late because of daylight savings?
[02:18.81]Shut up!
[02:21.47]No, what I meant to say was, yes, I value what you just said.
[02:25.77]But we live in a world where we move our clocks around.
[02:31.35]I'm kidding.
[02:31.83]I'm kidding.
[02:32.13]It was a joke.
[02:32.87]I'm kidding.
[02:33.19]Alright, let's turn this down.
[02:40.96]Yeah, that's one of the new tracks.
[02:41.90]There are four new tracks.
[02:43.39]Let's put the old one on.
[02:49.05]Here's the old one.
[02:53.09]And Blordow just... I don't know, honestly... Like, somebody gotta hire Blordow to make like a whole game soundtrack.
[03:04.15]When I listen to these songs that he makes... It's just like... I'm thinking like indie games that would just... He'd probably win fucking music of the year.
[03:13.63]If he actually got onto a game or something.
[03:17.13]Like, he would win soundtrack of the year.
[03:18.75]If he was able to just kind of go wild and do whatever he wanted.
[03:24.01]Speaking of Blordow, there's a lot of new people here that do not know who Blordow is.
[03:31.29]Let's go ahead and make a very, very quick shout out to Blordow.
[03:36.12]Blordow is the person responsible for the J, the way that it looks.
[03:41.25]It's whole design.
[03:42.74]All the channel branding that you see is from Blordow.
[03:46.66]All the music that you've heard, at least on regular streams like this, sometimes it's not Blordow.
[03:53.48]But for the most part, the little tracks you hear are Blordow.
[03:58.85]I want to make sure that we send some support his way.
[04:03.79]Let me get you some links here.
[04:10.27]This is his band camp.
[04:13.33]Make sure we get that in the exclamation point if we can for exclamation point floor down.
[04:21.21]And he also has one of those coffee?
[04:24.92]Kofi?
[04:25.30]Whatever it is.
[04:29.72]He's absolutely incredibly talented.
[04:33.02]Deserves to be supported for sure.
[04:36.45]It's coffee, right?
[04:37.49]Well, I don't know.
[04:38.67]Kofi.
[04:39.27]What am I supposed to say?
[04:40.30]I don't know.
[04:45.48]Is it SoundCloud 2?
[04:46.55]Yeah.
[04:48.99]That you're going to hear today another like three or four tracks and there's more badges going up and me and BlurredOut were talking and we think we might be doing potentially seasonal VRB screens, seasonal intro screens that have different music and different animations and not just this one.
[05:11.80]Why not, right?
[05:12.78]It should be fun.
[05:14.78]seasonal BRB yeah stuff for holidays maybe I don't know just that'd be fun this is a new season it's crazy that it took me this long alright it took me so long to do any of this stuff if we're like 11 years into me being on youtube and Twitch and stuff like it's what the hell why is it taking me this long
[05:50.06]Lazy, yeah.
[05:53.46]Yeah, maybe a little.
[05:58.26]If it isn't broke, don't fix it.
[06:02.68]Did I say that wrong?
[06:04.22]If it ain't, if it's not broke, if it isn't broken, how did I, what did I say?
[06:09.56]If it ain't broke, don't fix it?
[06:12.78]What?
[06:13.50]How do you say that?
[06:15.49]Okay, no, I got it right.
[06:20.38]Yeah, I said it right.
[06:21.00]I got it, I got it.
[06:23.13]Alright, let's, uh, we're gonna play Gas Station Simulator today.
[06:27.13]Hope everyone had a good week.
[06:29.41]We will be live today, and probably Wednesday.
[06:35.65]So, we'll do that.
[06:37.49]Got some stuff to do.
[06:38.13]Gas Station Simulator, I'm looking forward to it.
[06:41.29]How are you?
[06:41.63]I'm doing okay.
[06:42.59]I'm doing alright, you know?
[06:45.65]I'm doing alright.
[06:47.05]I'm doing good.
[06:47.96]I'm doing alright.
[06:52.08]If it fixed... Broke it.
[06:56.67]He's so high already.
[06:57.99]I'm not... I'm not... I'm not gonna... Okay.
[07:02.03]It's time for boring games?
[07:03.47]Boring games are back?
[07:04.65]Pog?
[07:05.05]What do you... What?
[07:10.68]This is a boring game?
[07:11.60]I thought... Everybody wants me to play this.
[07:12.98]Everybody's been... So many people have wanted me to play this game.
[07:16.28]That's not a boring game.
[07:19.58]How is this a boring game?
[07:26.74]You're stalling.
[07:27.70]I'm... No, I'm not stalling.
[07:29.72]We just heard new streaming musical content.
[07:36.28]We heard new streaming musical content.
[07:38.72]That's not stalling.
[07:39.39]Alright, let's go.
[07:48.59]Gas station simulator.
[07:51.10]Again, support Blordow.
[07:54.62]A lot of the character and a lot of the vibe of this stream is because of Blordow.
[08:01.54]Right?
[08:04.86]And he's going to be making more shit.
[08:06.46]So, go support him.
[08:07.88]Alright, make sure my camera's not on.
[08:11.65]It's not.
[08:12.17]Alright, gas station simulator.
[08:13.31]Let's go.
[08:16.37]Can you hear it?
[08:17.59]Because I can't.
[08:18.23]Oh, there it is.
[08:24.53]A little loud for me, not for you.
[08:27.88]I'm not stalling!
[08:29.28]I'm not- What do I mean stall- How am I stalling?
[08:31.26]Stop!
[08:31.58]Okay.
[08:33.37]So how do we play?
[08:36.45]I'll badge check.
[08:39.55]Anybody have the new ones?
[08:40.53]There's like six or seven new ones.
[08:42.47]There's more.
[08:43.69]But I want some of the newer ones that are a little less... There's some that are a little less elaborate that I want to be in that two, three, four, five, six month period, right?
[08:56.40]But I don't think I can move them around.
[08:58.50]I think I actually have to delete them and reupload them.
[09:01.10]So I have to do that.
[09:02.90]I'll do that another time.
[09:04.40]But there should be some new ones there.
[09:07.59]Alright, gas station simulator.
[09:10.53]It may take a while for what?
[09:12.83]To load the game?
[09:18.53]There's a GTA screen.
[09:26.41]Gas station simulator.
[09:31.72]Have you updated Windows?
[09:34.29]I have not updated Windows in like probably like a year.
[09:36.69]I'm just kidding.
[09:37.81]Am I driving?
[09:42.98]No, it's a cutscene.
[09:45.10]Loud cutscene.
[09:45.90]Be careful.
[09:46.96]Be aware.
[09:47.54]Loud cutscene.
[09:53.93]Is there no mirror?
[09:58.77]Oh, wait.
[09:59.17]No, there is.
[09:59.61]I was going to say, where is it?
[10:07.89]Am I gonna get the car stuck?
[10:23.44]Oh, congratulations.
[10:24.00]You're now the owner of Dust Bowl Gas Station.
[10:26.86]Okay.
[10:27.16]Twelve hours later.
[10:34.29]I gotta turn on, like, V-Sync, I think.
[10:38.78]Okay, hold on.
[10:39.42]Hold on.
[10:39.82]I got... VSync has to turn on.
[10:45.10]Where is it?
[10:47.18]I'm seeing a lot of screen tearing.
[10:50.04]Where is it?
[10:50.42]Is it here?
[10:50.74]Display?
[10:54.09]Lock FPS.
[10:55.05]VSync on.
[10:57.13]Yeah.
[10:59.23]We can... Lock FPS... Yeah.
[11:02.23]Okay.
[11:05.51]We still getting screen tearing?
[11:08.24]That's much better.
[11:08.96]Okay.
[11:09.26]Better, better, better, better, better.
[11:10.18]60 FPS.
[11:11.48]Yeah, whatever.
[11:14.40]Change the FOV.
[11:16.99]I don't think you can.
[11:17.85]I think it's fine the way it is.
[11:22.11]This is going to come way down.
[11:23.29]0.3 maybe?
[11:28.97]Can somebody explain this to me?
[11:32.69]I know there's a really simple explanation, and people are gonna be like, dude, this is why, and you never knew that, you're an idiot.
[11:37.23]That's fine.
[11:38.97]Why does it seem like every single game I've ever played... Like, to get the mouse to actually work, it's gotta be way down here.
[11:50.11]Like, shouldn't this bar be way smaller?
[11:52.74]I feel like I would... There's no... Everybody always puts it, like, down here, like, one centimeter on the bar.
[12:01.81]Why does that keep happening?
[12:02.93]Is it because of just different mouse DPIs?
[12:04.85]Like, DPIs are just so high?
[12:06.13]Because, like, look.
[12:09.97]Ready?
[12:10.17]So that's at 0.3.
[12:10.57]And that, like, feels pretty good.
[12:14.61]Maybe 0.4.
[12:14.91]And that's all the way down to the left of the bar.
[12:18.52]Dude, you're an idiot.
[12:22.64]That's fine.
[12:23.58]Let's do 0.5.
[12:27.67]Alright, I gotta get out there.
[12:28.51]Gas station.
[12:29.59]I use high sensitivity.
[12:30.61]I usually like to keep it high.
[12:32.91]It kind of makes my head hurt a little bit.
[12:34.11]Alright, what we got?
[12:35.51]Figure out how to enter the gas station.
[12:37.15]Hint, while holding something, throw it.
[12:38.85]Right mouse bumper into the trash to get a score.
[12:40.97]What?
[12:41.15]Throw it into the trash can.
[12:46.97]Is there a trash can?
[12:49.47]Did you tweet?
[12:50.15]I didn't.
[12:50.85]Look at me.
[12:51.63]I'm not even fucking streaming.
[12:54.21]I didn't tweet.
[12:54.73]You're right.
[12:57.49]Let me take care of that.
[13:03.65]Stalling?
[13:08.49]Gas station simulator.
[13:13.80]Just to the point.
[13:14.44]We're not going to add any flare or anything.
[13:15.96]There we go.
[13:22.32]There it is.
[13:23.18]Okay.
[13:24.74]Okay.
[13:26.02]There.
[13:28.34]Am I colonoscopy tomorrow?
[13:29.32]What do I have?
[13:31.62]Retry?
[13:32.16]What?
[13:33.94]That didn't go through?
[13:34.86]Why?
[13:35.12]How did my tweet didn't go through?
[13:40.13]What?
[13:44.91]Why not?
[13:49.85]And why does this happen?
[13:50.77]Do you hear this?
[13:52.15]Did you hear that?
[13:52.71]Somebody had to have heard that.
[13:55.08]Why does my volume just go to a hundred randomly when I type?
[13:58.95]Does that happen to you guys?
[14:01.79]What the fuck does that do that for?
[14:03.25]I didn't know.
[14:08.39]I'm not hacked.
[14:10.45]That happens all the time.
[14:15.27]This will go to a thousand percent volume.
[14:18.47]Okay.
[14:18.77]Gas station simulator.
[14:19.85]Tweet.
[14:20.94]Your tweet was sent.
[14:21.84]Okay.
[14:24.34]I don't understand why.
[14:29.50]Dude, you gotta fucking freeze your credit score.
[14:33.76]Oh, shit.
[14:35.12]Yeah, guys, my tweet didn't go through.
[14:37.27]I gotta freeze my credit scores.
[14:38.45]I'll be back.
[14:39.09]I'll see you, like, next week or something.
[14:40.37]Throw into the trash.
[14:49.45]There's a percentage for throwing?
[14:51.18]Okay, well, I can throw things.
[14:53.04]Where's the trash?
[14:59.40]Are you serious?
[15:00.26]Holy shit.
[15:03.08]Oh, right here.
[15:03.48]There it is.
[15:03.76]Yeah, I got the high score.
[15:08.23]This is some Olympian shit right here.
[15:14.79]Alright, well, it's kind of hard to do.
[15:16.01]Figure out how to enter the gas station.
[15:19.83]Okay.
[15:23.32]Give me a break.
[15:23.90]What the fuck?
[15:24.44]Okay.
[15:26.86]Okay, let's go.
[15:30.16]Do I get money for doing this or just points or something?
[15:33.68]Last score, longest score distance.
[15:38.98]Why is that thing?
[15:44.59]Do I have to empty the dumpster?
[15:49.83]How am I supposed to do this?
[15:53.69]This is not a gas station.
[15:54.81]This is a disaster.
[15:59.88]It's going to take like $500,000 to repair all this and redo everything.
[16:13.99]Is that even my house?
[16:14.91]Yeah.
[16:21.94]What is that?
[16:22.36]Can I sprint?
[16:27.28]What's this like alien spaceship over here?
[16:31.89]What is that?
[16:34.81]Oh, this is a sign.
[16:37.55]Oh, boy.
[16:44.50]Oh, boy.
[16:45.86]That was bad.
[16:47.52]I thought that was, like, a weird, like, tripod alien monster thing.
[16:57.68]Okay.
[16:57.86]What we got?
[17:00.20]More trash.
[17:00.86]Task completed.
[17:02.90]Okay.
[17:03.40]Follow the high voltage cable and find a way to turn on the electricity.
[17:06.56]I mean... Shouldn't I do something about this?
[17:09.60]This is bad.
[17:11.13]Can I repair this or redo this?
[17:14.09]Follow the high voltage cable.
[17:15.41]Okay.
[17:16.37]Caution.
[17:19.19]High voltage cable?
[17:27.36]Where's our high voltage cable?
[17:35.01]In here?
[17:35.43]Has it been back there?
[17:39.89]Read that clock.
[17:42.25]Uh... There's no minute hand, guys.
[17:46.08]I can't read it.
[17:49.12]I was about to say, holy shit, why can't I do this?
[17:52.02]Alright, where's the high voltage cable?
[17:53.68]Oh.
[18:03.09]Buy fuel.
[18:05.35]Oh, fuck.
[18:05.93]Okay, hold on.
[18:14.47]It's out here.
[18:15.17]I thought it was inside the house.
[18:17.56]That's why I didn't look at the... I thought it was inside the house.
[18:20.16]Okay, what have we got?
[18:28.84]Power.
[18:29.44]Back on.
[18:30.84]Bro, you've been streaming for four hours.
[18:32.06]I have not.
[18:36.96]Are you legitimately high today?
[18:38.32]No!
[18:38.58]Pick up the phone at the booth in the front of the station.
[18:48.39]No.
[18:50.23]I don't, like, coincide every time I turn on a stream with me being, like, high on marijuana cigarettes.
[18:57.18]Okay?
[18:58.14]Alright, who is it?
[19:05.36]congratulations on your purchase and investment little nephew it has been a while since you've heard my voice now hasn't it I guess yeah yes I'm a busy person but luck would have it that the land you've purchased once belonged to my father
[19:23.80]since you are not only a potential business partner but family no less I'll do my best to help you hey thank you I will send you emails on a regular basis providing you with information on how to handle each part of the business do make sure to pay attention well I always feel so bad about this kind of stuff okay it was pleasant speaking to you again
[19:47.40]Okay, let's be, let's be, uh, maybe potentially relatable Andy here.
[19:51.62]Um, so, how many times you guys opened up your email that you haven't, like, opened in, like, months?
[19:58.49]And, like, an aunt or an uncle has, like, sent you three emails.
[20:01.87]And it's just like, oh, fuck, I don't communicate this way at all.
[20:06.55]I don't wanna, I'm not trying to, like, avoid anybody or anything.
[20:09.71]I just don't communicate, like, through email.
[20:13.73]And I always, like, feel so terrible.
[20:16.79]I don't like to communicate at all.
[20:19.57]I'm serious.
[20:20.03]Alright, read the email on the computer.
[20:22.87]Okay.
[20:35.10]How do we turn the gas station on?
[20:36.36]Alright, gas station, mail.
[20:39.60]Howdy.
[20:41.67]Or greetings and salutations.
[20:43.85]The dialect never really was my forte.
[20:45.51]Regardless, I've just heard you've made a solid investment.
[20:47.97]Though, I pity the fact that you had to sell your car for it.
[20:50.82]You could have always asked me for a loan.
[20:53.60]I'll pitch in with a few tips and tricks.
[20:55.72]My emails will come periodically.
[20:57.20]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20:57.90]You need to get this station up and running.
[20:59.30]Who knows how badly it got damaged all those years ago.
[21:01.84]Don't forget to keep generating profit.
[21:03.58]Refurbish a fuel dispenser first.
[21:06.32]Oh, and don't worry about the money for this part.
[21:08.50]We're family after all.
[21:10.04]And family keeps an eye on each other's backs.
[21:12.26]And, uh, why am I doing, like, a sports center routine?
[21:16.75]And family keeps an eye on each other's backs.
[21:18.15]I'm here to lend a helping hand and make a man like me put some money where my mouth is, as they say.
[21:22.23]I feel like I'm reading about, like, the last NFL game.
[21:26.63]Like, baseball game or something.
[21:28.99]Market player already played this game.
[21:34.49]Yeah?
[21:35.27]Okay.
[21:37.44]And he's, like, the god of the internet.
[21:39.36]That's... What do you want me to say?
[21:40.52]Like... That's literally, like, god of online entertainment.
[21:52.73]Who doesn't, like, like Markiplier?
[21:57.07]Right?
[22:00.61]You know, I watched a Jacksepticeye video the other day.

[22:39.94]Well, I do have friends, but, you know, forget what I'm saying.
[22:42.48]I would want them to watch YouTubers like that.
[22:46.39]That's, I'm not, whatever.
[22:56.95]okay question mark I didn't bring him up you did why is everybody acting like I just brought up these the YouTubers out of nowhere you know guys let me tell you something I watched uh markiplier yesterday and boy was he he was great no I was react oh hold on
[23:23.37]But I mean, I like those guys.
[23:25.38]I think they've got good channels.
[23:27.96]What?
[23:28.78]What, I can't talk?
[23:29.72]I'm not allowed to talk about somebody?
[23:31.02]In like a positive way?
[23:33.46]I don't have any gas?
[23:41.11]Oh, shit.
[23:44.67]How am I supposed to?
[23:45.33]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23:48.17]Find a way to refuel Rudy.
[23:51.46]Search around for an old Jerry can.
[23:53.60]Okay.
[23:54.06]I need to find an old can.
[24:00.34]This dude runs a gas station and is out of gas.
[24:02.86]Okay.
[24:09.48]While holding the Jerry can, click left mouse button on the distributor to replenish it.
[24:14.38]If it's full, click left mouse button on the excavator's fuel cap to refuel it.
[24:17.92]Okay.
[24:20.58]So I can equip with... Ooh.
[24:22.66]This is empty!
[24:30.25]You have new mail.
[24:31.33]And that's gonna go to... There's gonna be an X next to new mail up to, like, 12,000.
[24:36.19]Okay.
[24:39.98]Place.
[24:42.54]And... Wait.
[24:44.88]Did I get it?
[24:47.00]Oh, shit.
[24:47.36]I got it.
[24:47.76]Alright.
[24:49.65]Alright, now I gotta refuel Rudy.
[24:54.13]Why does this game exist?
[24:56.71]I think it's kinda cool.
[24:57.47]Okay, this is full up.
[25:04.15]Alright, so now... Return to removing the sand piles.
[25:09.23]Alright.
[25:09.89]Sand piles.
[25:13.23]Remove sand piles.
[25:17.97]Press F to interact.
[25:20.85]Fuck, don't do that!
[25:23.63]Why is it saying F to interact?
[25:25.29]Okay, hold to break turbo.
[25:34.65]Okay, please.
[25:36.65]I have to remove the sand?
[25:38.22]How do I do that?
[25:48.56]I didn't do it?
[25:53.39]When the exhaust turns red, hold right mouse button to cool the engine.
[25:56.46]Overheating locks turbo.
[25:58.06]How do I do the turbo?
[26:04.82]I have no idea.
[26:07.42]Don't flip it over.
[26:10.96]Spacebar, brake.
[26:11.80]What about T?
[26:16.09]Okay, left mouse button to pick up and drop sand.
[26:20.25]Okay, so it's left mouse button.
[26:27.71]Okay, so get right here.
[26:28.61]I got it.
[26:36.81]Where am I supposed to put this?
[26:39.07]Open the gas station for customers?
[26:41.32]This thing's pretty much on fire inside.
[26:43.92]What?
[26:48.30]I wouldn't want to open.
[26:48.94]This is a hazard.
[26:53.68]Can I dump it?
[26:58.39]How do I dump this?
[27:05.64]Oh, fucking whatever.
[27:06.42]Am I in trouble?
[27:19.70]Okay, what?
[27:20.18]The light's on.
[27:20.70]Alright, gas stations.
[27:25.74]Turn it on.
[27:28.67]Flip the switch, let's go.
[27:34.01]You can open and close the gas station at any time.
[27:36.51]Use the downtime to organize the gas station or do other activities that you can find.
[27:40.67]Right next to the lever there is a button that restarts traffic.
[27:46.27]What?
[27:50.78]We're open for business!
[27:56.20]My entrepreneurship begins today!
[28:04.82]Oh shit, a customer.
[28:08.90]Please stop.
[28:11.84]Okay, refill your fuel supplies using the PC.
[28:14.86]What?
[28:15.94]Oh shit, there's a customer.
[28:16.96]Where's my PC?
[28:17.90]It's a mess in here.
[28:20.64]Delivery.
[28:21.26]I need fuel.
[28:22.52]How much?
[28:22.78]Two cents?
[28:27.42]Your order is less than 100 units.
[28:28.58]Alright, I need 100 units.
[28:29.90]Order.
[28:31.52]I need gas first.
[28:35.01]Hello.
[28:37.22]Welcome.
[28:41.10]Uh.
[28:42.70]Is it gas in here?
[28:49.22]Craig.
[28:53.02]Are you trying to scam me?
[28:54.60]I don't have any gas.
[29:10.75]This is like the Luigi driving by in Mario Kart phase.
[29:15.27]Holy shit, man.
[29:16.15]I'm sorry.
[29:23.23]Oh, here's the delivery.
[29:25.53]Don't come in.
[29:28.75]Wait, I want you to come in.
[29:29.80]This is the delivery truck?
[29:31.66]Why is this a hearse?
[29:32.42]Is this what it looks like?
[29:34.50]It looks like the Oscar Mayer hot dog car?
[29:37.84]This is what that car looks like?
[29:44.25]That's crazy.
[29:44.93]Alright, yeah, back it up.
[29:50.17]It's the Wienermobile.
[29:53.73]You're literally insane.
[29:55.09]I hope you know that.
[29:55.99]Yeah, I mean, I'm... I guess you're right.
[30:00.61]Alright, hook it up.
[30:07.03]Need help?
[30:09.41]Oh, shit, nice.
[30:17.11]Alright, you can't hit anybody.
[30:18.27]Just in case you were wondering.
[30:20.46]Because I wasn't.
[30:24.46]Alright, is it in?
[30:26.80]Wait, am I putting it back in his car?
[30:31.86]Oh shit, I think I put it back in his car.
[30:36.16]How do I get it?
[30:36.86]Do I have it?
[30:45.45]Is there gas in there?
[30:48.40]Wait, there's a customer.
[30:50.27]Do I have fuel?
[30:51.79]I don't have any fucking fuel!
[30:53.09]What?!
[30:55.61]Hey!
[30:56.11]No!
[30:56.55]I'm not gonna pay for it if you take it!
[31:00.95]Get back here!
[31:01.87]Get back!
[31:02.53]I'm gonna put my mouth on it!
[31:08.01]What happened to my gas?
[31:12.27]Officer!
[31:13.23]Arrest that man!
[31:15.93]I have gas?
[31:17.10]It said no fuel.
[31:27.01]You have a hundred?
[31:27.94]I just walked around three times.
[31:38.96]The gas, the person at the pump right now is like, I just watched this guy walk around his house three times.
[31:43.97]This guy's on a fucking crack.
[31:47.13]Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[31:53.79]So what, that's how much gas they want?
[31:57.65]Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[32:00.42]You're welcome.
[32:04.82]Open tools?
[32:07.72]I have a backpack, okay.
[32:08.56]Alright, goodbye.
[32:11.74]Who's coming up next?
[32:12.42]How much gas do I have?
[32:14.40]Only 85.
[32:14.66]I need more gas.
[32:22.10]Sweep the cars with the broom.
[32:24.48]Is there a broom?
[32:25.98]Where?
[32:26.10]Where?
[32:29.89]Where's this broom you're talking about?
[32:31.31]Where's the broom?
[32:40.10]Play the arcade game.
[32:41.08]Yeah, but this... Wait, I gotta close the gas station.
[32:46.39]No, alright, I'm going.
[32:48.23]Test your skills in the arcade.
[32:52.97]You unlock it later.
[32:53.79]Okay, well, I don't have it then.
[32:55.01]I don't have it right now.
[33:02.95]What is this?
[33:03.29]What the fuck?
[33:11.86]Race car.
[33:14.78]Get through all the checkpoints in the outlined order.
[33:16.78]Finish the race before 115 to get 20 bucks.
[33:18.64]Um...
[33:32.53]Oh shit.
[33:32.83]Alright, I got it.
[33:39.54]Well, I mean, how was I supposed to know where the road went?
[33:44.00]I can still do it.
[33:59.47]Okay.
[34:00.33]Why did that happen?
[34:02.64]F to quit the car.
[34:03.60]Well, I don't think it was a minute 15.
[34:05.42]I don't think I'm going to get a minute 15.
[34:11.28]This is for $20.
[34:12.34]This is just a mini golf course.
[34:28.87]Oh my god.
[34:33.43]I thought this said save the customer at the fuel dispenser.
[34:38.33]What happened?
[34:38.79]What did he do?
[34:44.27]The car can only be refueled after the customer has left the car.
[34:47.15]Okay, hello.
[34:55.67]Grab the injector when client is waiting.
[34:57.51]Fuel cap will be outlined.
[34:59.09]Fuel the car by interacting with the cap.
[35:01.01]Boost the speed.
[35:01.64]Hit the mark to get pay to tip.
[35:11.92]Got it.
[35:13.78]Thank you.
[35:14.02]Where's the broom?
[35:19.79]Okay, I have 72 liters.
[35:21.93]Which, that should last me a little while.
[35:24.01]320 bucks?
[35:26.74]What else can I do?
[35:27.94]Buy a trash bag and equip it.
[35:32.62]Oh, here we go.
[35:33.84]Trash bag, free.
[35:37.01]You can buy tools.
[35:37.89]Okay.
[35:39.95]Trash.
[35:40.39]With a trash bag, you can pick up small garbage and replace garbage bags in trash cans.
[35:45.37]Bigger garbage like junk or filled trash bags must be put in containers outside.
[35:49.39]You need to order garbage collection using a PC.
[35:54.35]If you left trash cans for a long time, they'll start to stink and discourage customers.
[35:59.78]Why would I have opened this place yet?
[36:05.62]Okay, so... Collect small trash.
[36:15.77]Okay, then do I just dump it?
[36:16.87]Okay.
[36:23.94]Empty the trash cans inside the station with your trash bags.
[36:34.97]Okay.
[36:39.18]Dispose of filled trash bags and old furniture.
[36:41.14]Alright.
[36:50.62]I like this.
[36:51.40]This is hitting all the notes for me right here.
[36:53.14]Alright, there's a bunch of trash.
[37:01.00]Hold on.
[37:11.13]Yeah, I know it's making bags.
[37:12.83]I'm gonna run around and pick them all up later.
[37:14.33]What do you have for a coaster?
[37:27.55]Uh, it's Pac-Man coasters.
[37:32.41]Just Pac-Man.
[37:33.67]You know, nothing's crazy.
[37:39.06]Can't throw away the grandfather clock.
[37:40.56]That'd be weird.
[37:40.90]Alright, let me see.
[37:42.00]Disposive-filled trash bags.
[37:45.96]You got it.
[37:51.86]Oh, shit.
[37:52.34]Alright, I gotta get good at this.
[37:54.72]It's not 20%.
[37:55.40]What is it?
[37:55.80]From this door, what is it from here to here?
[37:59.28]If I hold my cursor, like, right there.
[38:03.16]Nope.
[38:03.76]It's probably, like, 40% a little bit higher.
[38:05.76]Like, right here.
[38:08.85]Yep, okay.
[38:09.23]I think I got it down.
[38:10.73]God damn it.
[38:22.92]There's so much junk everywhere.
[38:24.18]Is it a customer?
[38:29.32]Oh, it's a cop.
[38:36.23]Alright.
[38:38.46]You got it!
[38:38.80]Thank you!
[38:45.56]Should I... close the gas station?
[39:00.01]No, I...
[39:11.81]I have to clean up.
[39:14.67]Anarchy, anarchy, anarchy, anarchy.
[39:16.61]No, no.
[39:17.35]Anarchy.
[39:18.09]Okay.
[39:19.47]I'm trying to run my business here.
[39:20.91]Everybody in chat is saying anarchy, anarchy, anarchy, anarchy.
[39:36.34]Oh, that's funny.
[39:38.63]Any more trash?
[39:48.49]How much can fit in one dumpster?
[39:52.95]Guess we'll find out.
[39:58.78]This is still going in, right?
[39:59.76]Yeah.
[39:59.88]There's so much trash.
[40:08.65]Although, I'm probably going to be able to clean this up, though.
[40:10.45]I'm looking forward to this.
[40:11.41]This is going to be awesome.
[40:19.36]God damn it.
[40:24.11]It's with the calming music.
[40:26.35]Yeah, it is kind of just calming, isn't it?
[40:33.15]Should I call for the service to come pick this up?
[40:35.94]Or should I...
[40:38.22]Should I pay for one dumpster when I need four dumpsters worth of space?
[40:44.90]But just pile everything on top up to here with one dumpster and pay one dumpster price.
[40:49.97]Customer.
[40:58.25]Hello, sir?
[41:00.21]Madam?
[41:01.33]How are you?
[41:02.21]Hold on, let me just... Hold on.
[41:07.16]You had a little stain on your window there.
[41:08.62]Welcome.
[41:09.00]I got the best gas prices in the entire valley.
[41:12.74]You just stay right there.
[41:18.61]Perfect every time.
[41:19.57]Remember, tell your friends.
[41:22.59]I really appreciate a potential at least four star on Yelp if you could.
[41:27.24]We have zero reviews, even on Google, which is unheard of.
[41:30.30]Yep.
[41:30.62]Thank you.
[41:31.82]Have a wonderful evening.
[41:32.70]Tell your friends.
[41:40.13]Thank you.
[41:40.59]Okay.
[41:49.08]Yeah, and none of that bullshit where on Google you give me a 5, but on your Yelp account you give me like a 3.8.
[41:55.24]None of that bullshit.
[42:07.91]Google's always higher.
[42:10.08]You gotta be careful.
[42:11.78]You have to take the average.
[42:15.58]If you look up like a restaurant, like, oh, what's this place?
[42:17.50]This place looks kind of good.
[42:18.78]Maybe I'll try here, maybe.
[42:20.34]How's this one?
[42:21.92]It's got like a 4.8 on Google.
[42:24.30]And on Yelp, that same place has like a 3.5.
[42:26.52]It's like, what is going on here?
[42:29.52]Who recommends gas stations?
[42:31.12]I...
[42:40.91]What's wrong with recommending a gas station?
[42:44.23]What if it's like the people there are friendly and... Oh!
[42:47.14]Hello!
[42:51.02]I'm so glad you made it to my station.
[42:54.02]What a car.
[42:56.92]2016?
[42:57.60]Oh, love it.
[42:58.80]Love it.
[42:59.06]Love the paint job, too.
[43:00.22]That's like an ocean teal.
[43:03.01]Absolutely fantastic.
[43:03.95]These are off-road tires, too.
[43:06.63]Very, very cool.
[43:08.31]You come out here often?
[43:10.44]Yeah, yeah, nice.
[43:11.30]Just on vacation with the family.
[43:12.12]That's really cool.
[43:12.88]Awesome, awesome, awesome.
[43:16.23]So, I'll just fill you up.
[43:17.95]And I got snacks, too, if you need anything.
[43:19.45]Thank you.
[43:21.39]You didn't need very much.
[43:24.30]Yeah, I gave you a pretty decent review of your car.
[43:27.65]Thought it was a nice car.
[43:29.06]I would probably give your car, I would say, probably like a 4.5.
[43:30.88]That's what I would give your car.
[43:34.90]So, whatever you want to give me.
[43:37.26]I gave you a 4.5 on your teal.
[43:40.66]Thanks for coming again.
[43:51.15]Just don't talk to the customers.
[43:53.31]Why not?
[44:00.29]Why are you such a serial killer?
[44:02.11]Um... I have to get this taken.
[44:07.87]There's too much here.
[44:16.94]You're a real charlatan.
[44:20.92]No, I have... I have fair gas at fair prices.
[44:24.12]Okay?
[44:24.90]I'm gonna buy a broom.
[44:31.56]Let's just clean it up a little bit.
[44:32.46]Okay.
[44:38.76]So what is it?
[44:39.48]Sweep the floor?
[44:40.30]Oh, this cleaning.
[44:43.92]In the top left corner, you can see the floor's dirty status.
[44:49.62]Swipe the footprints, paint stains, and other dirt from the floor.
[44:53.00]If you do not take care of the cleanliness, customers will stop shopping.
[44:56.13]What do you mean shopping?
[45:00.85]This thing sucks.
[45:03.41]This doesn't do anything.
[45:06.23]Oh my god, this is going to take forever.
[45:07.37]Alright, is there any... Hold on.
[45:17.10]You actually have to sweep with it.
[45:18.26]You have to push it.
[45:19.12]There we go.
[45:26.01]I need more...
[45:30.41]Don't, no.
[45:33.09]Yeah.
[45:34.31]Yeah, I'll get back on that in just a second.
[45:36.69]Fill that order for the customer back there.
[45:38.73]Yeah, we want to take care of our people there.
[45:41.65]Hey, how are you?
[45:42.49]Good to see you.
[45:43.97]Okay, gonna fill you up here.
[45:45.31]Sorry, we got some customers.
[45:46.83]Pretty busy.
[45:50.63]What do you need?
[45:50.97]Just regular unleaded?
[45:52.37]You've got it.
[45:55.58]How much do I owe you?
[45:56.52]$29.75. $29.75.
[45:59.24]Have a great day.
[46:00.17]Have a wonderful day.
[46:01.17]Have a good day.
[46:01.83]Have a good day.
[46:02.73]Have an awesome day.
[46:03.51]Okay.
[46:19.94]You're a psycho.
[46:21.30]Whatever.
[46:24.84]It took you this long to figure that out?
[46:36.89]Oh, MonkaW!
[46:39.05]MonkaF!
[46:44.33]Why won't this clean?
[46:45.07]Shit.
[46:55.19]Don't I have two of these?
[46:55.99]Where's the other one?
[47:01.75]Oh, MonkaW.
[47:02.47]We should have seen it earlier.
[47:04.03]Oh, God.
[47:04.81]Whatever.
[47:10.47]Can you please do the so you married into it routine again?
[47:13.31]No.
[47:15.48]Oh, shit.
[47:16.60]You know what?
[47:17.26]Actually, that makes sense today.
[47:19.16]That makes sense today.
[47:22.08]You live in that house, not back?
[47:25.02]Well, yes, we have.
[47:27.23]We lived in Temple, Texas for many years.
[47:33.05]Can I have a room?
[47:38.89]This is powerful.
[47:42.08]Holy shit.
[47:46.76]What?
[47:59.21]How are you going to leave?
[48:01.43]Wait, hold on.
[48:02.03]Hold on.
[48:02.27]I'll get it back.
[48:15.19]Well, I just had to rotate your tires.
[48:18.29]Okay.
[48:20.91]How much gas do you need?
[48:26.67]Thank you.
[48:28.61]And we'll see you soon.
[48:36.61]Uh... What?
[48:41.61]Alright, see you later.
[48:42.30]Have fun.
[48:42.88]Thanks for coming.
[48:57.42]Hold on, wait.
[49:04.04]Oh my god!
[49:17.91]Brum is very powerful.
[49:19.39]3.5 on Yelp, yeah.
[49:24.72]That's not gonna softlock me, right?
[49:26.42]Hold on.
[49:27.40]It might actually softlock the game.
[49:36.67]Dude.
[49:37.35]Oh.
[49:38.77]Oh.
[49:40.70]Okay.
[49:41.88]It's gonna take a little... It's gonna take a little bit of time, but I have an experiment I would like to try.
[49:47.29]I want to pile just cars up on the road here in front.
[49:51.07]I have like a stack of like 30 of them.
[49:54.39]I wonder if we're not gonna be able to get any more spawns.
[49:57.95]Not yet, though.
[49:58.59]Not yet.
[49:58.93]We'll go back.
[50:00.09]Oh, shit.
[50:17.90]Why does this stream look awful?
[50:19.34]It does?
[50:19.64]What do you mean?
[50:20.96]I'm very curious what you mean by that.
[50:25.46]Looks... Oh, I ran out of gas.
[50:30.19]Oh shit, here comes the Yelp review.
[50:33.03]I can't believe a gas station ran out of gas.
[50:35.89]How does that make any sense?
[50:36.83]It's the only gas station within 30 miles.
[50:43.30]Shit, I need to order more gas.
[50:48.91]I need a... gas.
[50:52.83]How much... The order has been reduced to match the available capacity.
[50:56.15]How much money do I have?
[50:56.85]Alright, I need it.
[50:58.23]I have like no money left.
[51:06.24]Alright.
[51:09.06]Back to what I was doing.
[51:10.36]Very important.
[51:15.78]I know how to use the broom.
[51:16.59]Leave me alone.
[51:18.12]Where's the car?
[51:20.16]I believe it despawned.
[51:23.98]Yeah, the car despawned.
[51:25.52]Well, I don't have any gas, so I have to turn people away.
[51:30.83]There's no gas in this gas station.
[51:32.51]Sorry, no gas.
[51:36.13]Wait, just do this.
[51:45.56]Turn off.
[51:50.26]The owner of the gas station is sitting out with a broom in front of the entrance.
[51:54.38]Swinging it around like an orc sword.
[52:00.56]What is he doing?
[52:07.73]We're not going to that gas station.
[52:08.99]You know what, by the way?
[52:09.69]I would open up Yelp and I would just say that this is kind of a dangerous place.
[52:15.50]I would give it a 1.
[52:18.78]And then reply from the business owner.
[52:24.47]I'm very sorry that you feel that that happened that way.
[52:27.33]Please, if there's anything I could do about it, send an email to this email that I don't check.
[52:32.77]That's probably a dead email that I haven't opened in years.
[52:35.95]We value your feedback.
[52:38.39]Thank you for shopping at the Jerma gas station.
[52:42.35]I was about to throw this guy.
[52:49.72]Hi, David.

[52:53.75]Please hit me up at my email.
[53:06.49]Alright, connected.

[53:13.23]Alright, let's turn it.
[53:24.38]Thanks a lot.
[53:29.71]I have a bunch of email.
[53:30.47]I don't read guys.
[53:31.81]Do you understand?
[53:32.37]I don't like read emails.
[53:34.79]I don't answer phone calls.

[58:09.24]And even if they don't review, they will remember this weird, like, guy that did the weird voice.
[58:14.76]And they'll come back because they'll remember it.
[58:16.47]It's going to be in their brain.
[58:25.03]Okay, how do I get somebody to take this?
[58:27.81]You know what I'm saying?
[58:33.12]Like, how does it... It said, oh, we have somebody pick up the trash.

[59:09.60]I think I have to move this.
[59:26.77]Wait, no, no.
[59:29.53]No, you don't have to take your shoes off at the door to come into the gas station to buy a Coke.
[59:35.48]Can you imagine?
[59:40.06]No shoes in the gas... Yeah, excuse me.
[59:42.42]I just have these floors cleaned.
[59:45.62]You gotta leave your shoes at the door.
[59:51.63]There we go.
[59:52.21]Okay, garbage collection.

[60:00.23]Dennis.
[60:02.05]Dennis will appear on station occasionally and paint graffiti on the walls.
[60:06.33]Stop him by throwing items at him to scare him off.
[60:09.87]New events will appear during the course of the game.
[60:12.11]You can turn them off in the option so they don't happen again.
[60:14.29]What?

[61:07.01]Well, you see, he was putting graffiti on my walls, and I had to scare him off.

[65:40.70]No, I mean, I'm almost 40, which is kind of terrifying.
[65:45.62]Weird.
[65:47.10]When I was younger, when I was like in my teens, somebody that was 40 was... Okay.
[65:56.88]It was like the dentist.
[65:58.28]You know what I mean?
[65:59.04]Does that make sense?
[66:00.64]It was like, the dentist was 40, right?
[66:06.65]My teachers were 40.
[66:07.83]And they were old.
[66:10.80]It was like, oh, you're much older.
[66:12.16]You're like an older person.
[66:13.18]You're the dentist.
[66:14.92]You're the teacher.
[66:18.68]I will look at people like, oh, this person's like in the news or whatever.
[66:22.24]And they're like 33.
[66:25.10]And I look at them and I go, holy shit.
[66:26.84]I'm like three or four years older than this person?
[66:30.49]What?
[66:30.69]What?
[66:36.96]It's weird.
[66:44.81]You're 40 and still an E-clown.
[66:46.33]I'm not 40 yet.
[66:48.25]Not 40 yet.
[66:52.67]Midlife crisis?
[66:53.57]No, midlife crisis is when I'm like 50.
[66:55.18]I'm not there yet.
[66:57.22]I'm not having a midlife crisis.
[67:08.95]I definitely... Okay, here's one thing I will say.
[67:12.15]I definitely feel like I've grown up a lot.
[67:14.09]Like, in my brain.
[67:17.73]I'm pretty... I'm certain of it.
[67:21.61]I have to paint the walls?
[67:23.07]Oh, I just have it.
[67:26.60]Once equipped, I shift to select a color.
[67:31.54]I can paint whatever I want?
[67:35.88]Sure seems like it.
[67:36.74]Really?
[67:37.12]Really?
[67:44.47]I'm turning 18 and I don't think 40 is that old.
[67:47.87]No, it's not, but still.
[67:49.13]It's interesting to think about.
[67:49.91]Alright.
[67:55.22]Don't splash paint.
[67:57.18]Okay.
[67:58.84]What should I paint it?
[68:04.96]Oh, I really gotta... I hope that guy comes back.
[68:09.68]What happened?
[68:10.42]What happened?
[68:12.38]I don't... I don't understand what I'm supposed to be doing.
[68:15.64]Stay in the green?
[68:21.44]Oh, it's like Stardew Valley fishing.
[68:22.70]I get it.
[68:23.02]Okay.
[68:25.74]I hope that guy comes back with that teal car.
[68:29.02]What the fuck?
[68:36.90]Hey, take a look at my, like the color?
[68:39.38]Yeah, I love that color too.
[68:41.98]What did I get?
[68:42.40]What did I rate your car, your color?
[68:44.08]It's like four something, I think.
[68:46.04]I mean, I got the same color.
[68:47.06]Well, great minds think alike.
[68:53.40]Move is really strange.
[68:57.51]Does this cost money?
[69:03.07]It doesn't look like it does.
[69:17.21]Paint their car.
[69:24.73]No, that's awful.
[69:26.75]I'm gonna paint somebody else's car.
[69:42.96]What?
[69:44.43]What happened?
[69:45.11]Why is it white?
[69:56.61]I'm not sure that thing really matters.
[69:57.95]Because it just paints it anyways.
[70:06.31]What's your thoughts on couscous?
[70:07.51]It's really good.
[70:08.97]It's really good.
[70:09.91]I think it's really good.
[70:22.44]So nice, they named it twice.
[70:23.74]Kinda like New York.
[70:27.85]New York City.
[70:30.67]The city's so nice, they named it twice.
[70:32.49]Could the whole thing just be green?

[78:07.69]It just goes all the way back, man.
[78:09.07]Don't, just stay there.
[78:09.75]Don't even get out of the car.
[78:10.63]There's no reason to.

[79:58.28]Alright, I have a question.

[80:22.32]Oh my god, how?
[80:23.34]What are the odds of that happening?
[80:36.43]See, this is why I don't want to be a dick about this.
[80:40.97]Excuse me, ma'am, but I'm going to be.
[80:42.25]This is why when you pull up, make sure you know what side your gas tank is on.
[80:46.65]So I don't have to do this shit.
[80:49.40]Thank you, though.
[80:50.58]Yep.

[82:58.88]Stop.
[83:00.80]Okay, he's not moving now.

[83:10.15]Great idea.
[83:18.35]Okay.
[83:20.75]Hey.
[83:22.59]Welcome.
[83:22.97]How are you?
[83:23.57]Good to see you.
[83:25.09]Let me just go ahead and fill you up real quick.
[83:27.13]But before I do that, I just have to give you a little bit, a few safety precautions with your vehicle.
[83:32.65]Make sure that everything checks out.
[83:34.45]You know, check the windshield wiper blade movements.
[83:40.61]Make sure they're not squeaking or anything.
[83:46.03]Oh, no, no.
[84:21.92]Why do you have hostages?
[84:22.94]I don't... Have you ever finished a thought in your life?
[84:37.21]That's a good question from my math teacher.
[84:42.15]It's a great question.
[84:50.64]That's a great question.
[84:52.44]For anyone that's ever communicated with me.
[85:01.58]I mean what?
[85:07.29]Because I would try to explain the math problem, and I'd get halfway through, and I'd be like, I'm not doing it anymore.
[85:15.11]I can't finish this.
[85:15.79]I can't finish this thought.
[85:16.71]I can't do it.
[85:21.74]Did I actually softlock myself?
[85:22.92]I might have.
[85:25.36]Pick the trunk of their car.
[85:27.98]Can you do that?
[85:31.16]No, you can't actually do that.
[85:43.89]Oh my god.
[85:45.07]Oh, that went very far.
[85:51.69]This is such a mess over here.
[85:58.86]Alright, I have to- Okay, honest to god.
[86:07.96]You just go- Wait, what?
[86:12.27]How did that happen?
[86:15.07]Everyone just get out of the way.
[86:16.03]Holy shit.
[86:27.42]Alright, we got in.
[86:37.27]I'm gonna break the game and we're gonna have to stop.
[86:39.77]Alright, I'm not gonna do that anymore.
[86:45.29]I have to go get a can.
[86:47.05]I have to fill up this thing and I have to figure out how to dump this shit here.
[86:52.93]I can't dump it.
[86:57.73]It's bugged.
[87:05.10]This shit is bugged.
[87:13.14]Oh, shit.
[87:13.72]Come here.
[87:15.82]Press T. No, I... I have to fill this thing up with gas.
[87:22.44]There's a dumping zone?
[87:26.90]Is that why I can't do it?
[87:27.71]Alright, come here.
[87:35.81]I have to dump it in the sand pit.
[87:39.41]Oh, shit.
[87:42.42]Okay.
[87:42.74]Okay.
[87:48.18]Fill it up.
[87:51.12]What?
[87:54.47]Where's that can?
[87:59.41]Oh.
[88:00.83]Literally in my inventory.
[88:04.73]I don't have time to deal with it.
[88:06.53]No.
[88:06.95]I'm sorry.
[88:08.17]Go find another gas station.
[88:09.37]I hit you like 15 miles that way.
[88:11.21]You'll find one.
[88:26.11]I need to buy more gas.
[88:32.31]Okay.
[88:32.63]Okay, actually no more messing around or anything because I'm going to run out of... I'm going to run out of money.
[88:47.80]Alright, I need to dump this shit.
[88:52.39]Where can I dump it?
[88:54.17]Right here?
[88:54.59]But this is where the parking spot is.
[88:58.25]Where's the dumping zone?
[89:08.62]Near the road entrance?
[89:16.68]Break the game waiting room.
[89:18.36]Sand disposal.
[89:19.68]Oh my god.
[89:23.25]Okay.
[89:23.41]Here you go.
[89:33.29]Why can't I just put it over to the right?
[89:38.08]This is a giant sign.
[89:39.44]You think I'm paying attention to the sign over there?
[89:41.52]Alright, fill it up.
[89:51.48]Now I can buy a parking spot.

[90:28.58]If you'd like to address me, that's how I will be addressed.
[90:44.03]D.Va.
[90:47.25]I don't want to be a D.Va.
[90:48.43]You know what I mean?
[90:49.21]Like, I really hope it never happens.
[90:51.51]I don't think it's ever... I hope it doesn't.
[90:53.05]I really don't.
[90:53.95]I hope not.
[90:56.05]This one's free.
[91:00.44]Oh, I just spray painted white spray paint on the sand?
[91:03.93]That didn't make a parking spot.
[91:05.25]What?
[91:10.83]Okay.
[91:16.59]Answer the call from uncle.
[91:21.61]Okay.

[96:35.98]Okay, here you go.
[96:39.49]And, um... Hold on, just one minute here.
[96:41.47]Hold on, sorry.
[96:42.01]I have to... I have to go to the bathroom.
[96:46.16]Wait, that's it?
[97:08.76]Not where you left it.
[97:09.76]No.
[97:10.94]Oh, well.
[97:14.72]What happened to this person?
[97:17.74]Is somebody still here?
[97:19.28]Oh, shit.
[97:19.72]Sorry.
[97:38.58]I'm trying to do it fast.
[97:42.70]What?
[97:43.37]It's a bag of snacks.
[97:44.33]What are you talking about?
[97:45.07]Sweep them.
[97:51.53]Nope.
[97:51.93]Doesn't work.
[97:54.19]You can't... You can't sweep people.
[97:57.36]It doesn't work.
[97:57.78]What the fuck is this?
[98:16.82]What?
[98:17.06]I don't understand.
[98:23.69]Is that one of the guy's cars that I threw like an hour ago?
[98:27.47]Didn't read the emails.
[98:32.73]I'm not dead, right?
[98:41.68]Is this my uncle?
[98:44.76]What happened?
[98:49.65]This is where you get ghosted by emails for six years.
[98:54.77]All those times I said, Merry Christmas.
[98:58.44]All the times I said, let me see the baby.
[99:02.52]Wake up, Sam.
[99:04.06]You've got a gas station to run.
[99:12.71]What, was I rescued by Uncle?
[99:19.47]And who is that guy?
[99:28.14]Wait, what?
[99:30.34]Wasn't he just here?
[99:32.46]I hope your head's no longer spinning.
[99:34.58]Why wouldn't we just talk?
[99:36.54]Why didn't he left and called me?
[99:38.60]There was a mistake.
[99:40.08]A serious one.
[99:41.74]You can rest easy knowing I will have the responsible people dealt proper retribution for what has happened.
[99:49.11]Wait.
[99:49.27]I'm not taking out anyone.
[99:50.85]Okay.
[100:17.15]You will need to make the warehouse operational again to receive it.
[100:20.57]I don't want a loan.
[100:21.27]I'm doing it with what I have in cash.
[100:23.80]You're a resolute lad.
[100:25.88]You'll figure it out.
[100:28.14]Okay.
[100:28.54]Thanks, uncle.
[100:29.08]Alright.
[100:38.32]Alright.
[100:38.88]I... Hold on.
[100:39.28]Do I have enough... Do I have enough gas?
[100:41.26]Stay right there.
[100:44.48]Just as I wanted.
[100:45.98]Okay, but I've been restocking things, I think.
[100:48.40]I need to buy fuel.
[100:53.38]Decorations.
[100:55.00]Didn't I just do that?
[100:56.62]Wait, hold on.
[101:09.90]This seems to be actually more cost efficient than the actual gas station.
[101:13.73]12 to 20 bucks every time?
[101:20.93]Clean the conveyor belt.
[101:21.75]Oh shit, you're right.
[101:24.78]This is so dirty.
[101:28.94]I can't.
[101:29.48]I have to wait till somebody's here.
[101:35.39]33.
[101:35.41]I have enough.
[101:39.31]Read emails.
[101:40.07]Alright, fine.
[101:40.53]Alone.
[101:44.15]Alone.
[101:46.58]Feel free to ask for it.
[101:47.20]It'll pick me up.
[101:47.64]You can reach out from your PC.
[101:48.98]A one-time injection of $1,000 should prop you back on your feet.
[101:51.96]Yep.
[101:52.16]Okay.
[101:55.22]Cash register.
[101:56.50]We already know how to do this.
[101:57.50]We know how to do all this.
[101:58.54]We know about Dennis.
[102:00.40]Okay.
[102:00.52]Alright.
[102:03.85]Need the sponge.
[102:08.91]Here we go.
[102:09.23]Alright.
[102:09.51]I don't want to mess with your stuff.
[102:10.41]Here, let's go.
[102:15.92]One more.
[102:16.26]Alright.
[102:19.50]Come on in.
[102:21.38]Email waiting room.
[102:22.36]No, stop it.
[102:32.52]Good.
[102:33.54]Very good.
[102:35.70]Just throw it on the floor.
[102:39.82]No, they leave if you do that.
[102:43.83]This is a huge eyesore.
[102:44.87]I really need to get rid of that, whatever it is.
[102:50.00]Oh, shit.
[102:51.72]Turn it on.
[102:53.46]Thank you.
[102:53.74]How are you doing?
[103:04.08]Bye.
[103:06.46]Alright.
[103:07.32]Complete all challenges to be able to upgrade the gas station.
[103:10.16]Okay, I get to buy an outdoor decoration.
[103:15.20]What did I get?
[103:18.16]Outdoor small table?
[103:22.41]I can only buy a small table.
[103:23.85]20 bucks.
[103:25.53]Alright, get it.
[103:25.97]I guess it just stays in a static place.
[103:29.41]Okay.
[103:34.68]Alright, I got gas.
[103:37.10]I've got... I gotta order more food.
[103:39.44]Purchase the level 2 upgrade to your gas station.
[103:44.10]Can I afford it?
[103:49.59]Level one.
[103:52.21]Level up.
[103:55.85]Oh, it's free.
[103:58.85]Hey, why did the paint go off?
[104:02.35]I upgraded level two to strip the paint.
[104:13.50]No!
[104:13.94]Shit, you get that for free.
[104:14.68]Whatever, I don't care.
[104:17.40]Don't be mad that you got a carton of milk for free.
[104:19.97]Why are people so pissed about that?
[104:21.13]Alright, find a way to enter the warehouse and open its gates.
[104:25.67]Okay.
[104:31.24]I need more stock.
[104:34.46]No, I can't do it yet.
[104:35.36]Okay.
[104:48.62]Thank you.
[104:49.12]Alright.
[104:49.32]Goodbye.
[104:50.08]Anybody?
[104:50.32]Yep.
[104:50.40]Come here.
[104:50.68]See you later.
[104:55.88]What are you doing back here?
[105:03.77]I find a way to enter the warehouse.
[105:06.65]Open its gates.
[105:13.65]I got a key.
[105:18.87]Alright, what do we got?
[105:21.95]One bag of potato chips.
[105:24.83]Thanks a bunch.
[105:25.89]You're welcome.
[105:27.16]You have a peanut-sized brain.
[105:32.68]That's smooth, creamy, and fucking delicious.
[105:35.06]Is that supposed to be an insult?
[105:45.82]What's it do with the hay?
[105:49.74]Do I need that for anything?
[105:58.00]What is this?
[105:58.56]Press F to play.
[106:04.46]What?
[106:04.74]How do you play?
[106:10.83]Change chord?
[106:20.85]Okay.
[106:23.36]A, S, D, Z. Oh, I didn't want to leave.
[106:31.40]Okay.
[107:03.86]Sounds like an organ.
[107:22.69]I told you guys before about that stream that I watched.
[107:25.97]This is like, I don't know, this is probably back at like, like Justin TV days.
[107:31.32]This is like before it was even Twitch.
[107:33.87]There was this guy that had headphones on, and the music was blasting into his ears, and he was sleeping.
[107:41.20]And you could, like, activate a thing that would blast music in his ears, or play something in his ears while he was asleep, and...
[107:48.69]He's just sitting there in this dark weird like kind of dark room and the webcam's kind of all pixelated and he's just in his bed with these big bulky headphones on and all you hear is like this blown out overdone like just absolute blown out piano mashing keys just like This dude's just sitting there with his eyes closed It was fucking mayhem
[108:22.68]I don't even know where you find that song.
[108:24.62]Like, I don't even understand.
[108:26.92]I was sitting there just going, what the fuck is going on, man?
[108:33.27]I was laughing so hard.
[108:38.27]But it was just somebody was just hammering like dozens and dozens of piano keys.
[108:42.59]Not a keyboard, a piano.
[108:46.69]The ones, you know, an old-fashioned piano where you have to put weight down on the keys.
[108:51.20]So sometimes it's like, dun, dun, depending on the pressure.
[108:56.22]So it was just all over the place.
[108:59.98]God, it's the funniest fucking thing ever.
[109:05.42]This customer is, hold on.
[109:11.57]reset all cars whoa whoa whoa what I need to open the gate wait I'll come hold on I'll be back what is this a wrench oh don't throw a saw at somebody customers it was just so damn funny it really was
[109:35.81]Mainly the fact that it's just he had a stone cold, just default blank face with huge headphones on.
[109:42.76]It was so abnormal.
[109:47.18]Like that was the perfect word to describe it.
[109:48.60]It was just so abnormal.
[109:55.03]I think about it all the time.
[109:58.63]Good job.
[110:02.09]You trying to prove a point to people that already believe- No, I'm just so excited to talk about it because it's like one of my favorite things I've ever seen.
[110:22.69]You have to recreate it?
[110:23.69]I don't have a piano.
[110:24.59]Okay, oh.
[110:29.23]More customers?
[110:35.66]Easy.
[110:36.42]Easy.
[110:36.76]Oh my god.
[110:39.40]Okay, I have to go back to the warehouse.
[110:41.34]Did it open the gate?
[110:44.98]Just use your thighs.
[110:46.82]Alright, I don't... Whatever you say.
[110:55.30]I have to open this gate.
[110:59.20]Oh, I see.
[110:59.56]Alright, let me get in here.
[111:05.52]There's a big lever on the wall.
[111:06.60]Alright, here we go.
[111:07.46]Keep your warehouse gates closed, otherwise someone may steal from you.
[111:11.65]What?
[111:13.51]Remove haystacks.
[111:21.24]It doesn't really matter where those go, right?
[111:27.28]I should really probably close the store.
[111:48.00]We've been saying that, holy shit.
[111:49.66]Yeah, but it's been fun.
[111:50.66]Alright, only three more?
[111:56.43]Oh.
[111:57.43]Right.
[111:57.93]Okay, there is, uh, there is that.
[112:00.83]Right here.
[112:02.99]Yeah, alright, hold on, let me go, I'm gonna go close this door.
[112:05.55]Let me serve the customers here, and then I'm closing.
[112:18.98]I still have plenty of gas.
[112:21.04]Alright.
[112:22.58]I'm almost out of stuff.
[112:27.90]Need to order more food.
[112:30.91]Thank you.
[112:34.67]Remember, you're the type of guy that wakes up your significant other to tell them you're going to bed.
[112:41.15]No.
[112:42.69]I'm the type of guy that if my significant other is sleeping...
[112:46.46]I do everything possible to not be heard at all.
[112:52.34]It takes me like 15 seconds to close the door if they're sleeping in that room.
[112:59.42]If I need to brush my teeth, I brush my teeth in a different room.
[113:06.48]And I move around unheard.
[113:12.04]Oh shit, I gotta take this out.
[113:25.88]Crash.
[113:26.22]Do you normally brush your teeth in a bedroom?
[113:32.31]Well, no.
[113:34.09]But I make sure that I...
[113:43.21]Oh, fuck.
[113:44.07]I just got caught.
[113:45.67]I just got caught and I didn't even know.
[113:47.37]You know, like when that happens, I just got caught.
[113:51.90]Because what that means for you is like, wait, what are you talking about?
[113:55.69]I'm a walking brusher.
[113:57.47]I walk around and brush my teeth.
[113:58.93]I walk around like my place and brush my teeth.
[114:04.97]So, I just got, yeah, I'm kind of a weird guy.
[114:08.81]My toothbrush travels around.
[114:12.19]Sometimes it's in the shower.
[114:14.89]Sometimes it's on, like, the kitchen sink.
[114:18.99]Sometimes it's in the bathroom.
[114:23.00]Yeah.
[114:26.76]I clean it!
[114:27.68]Not in the toilet, like, in the ba- Wait, wait, wait, where do you brush your teeth?
[114:37.63]That's not normal.
[114:39.07]It's- yes it is.
[114:39.67]The gas station- wait, the gas station's closed?
[114:42.07]Oh, why did he come in here?
[114:42.95]The red fucking sign!
[114:53.27]Bathroom sink.
[114:55.74]This- we're closed!
[114:58.26]We're closed.
[115:02.20]You're just gonna have to get back in your car and leave.
[115:03.78]Just go.
[115:04.40]We're closed.
[115:16.47]I really want to go into like the stratosphere with this one.
[115:18.69]There it is.
[115:26.45]That was a big spin too.
[115:27.65]What's wrong with me?
[115:31.39]Okay.
[115:37.13]Alright.
[115:37.57]Now that it's closed, I have some money.
[115:38.97]I need to finish painting.
[115:45.14]Yeah, I brush my teeth.
[115:46.76]Guys, I used to... Okay.
[115:48.80]I am one of those people that thinks brushing your teeth in the shower is more efficient.
[116:00.92]It's more efficient.
[116:07.09]I don't do it all the time, but...
[116:09.84]Okay, let's say, for instance, I'm going to give you a real example here.
[116:12.46]Because, I mean, I'm just going to tell you real stuff, okay?
[116:15.67]This is real things.
[116:19.25]So, let's just say a stream is about to start.
[116:23.46]How many of you guys do this?
[116:25.60]I know I'm not the only one.
[116:27.23]So you have like a thing you're doing.
[116:28.67]Or like an obligation you have.
[116:29.95]Or an appointment.
[116:30.67]Or you're meeting up with friends.
[116:31.99]Or whatever it is.
[116:32.47]It doesn't matter.
[116:33.79]It could be work or play related.
[116:35.07]It doesn't matter.
[116:36.17]And you know that you only have like five minutes to get ready.
[116:39.03]Maybe ten minutes tops.
[116:41.98]Do you...
[116:44.22]Uh, count to like 60 in your head three times in the shower.
[116:48.98]To guarantee that you don't get stuck.
[116:51.74]Shower stuck.
[116:53.15]Because that shit happens all the time.
[116:56.77]And sometimes, I will get into the shower going, okay, I'm gonna count to 60 three times, that's three minutes.
[117:03.91]And I will get to 60, I will do, I will get to like 120 seconds, and stop counting.
[117:11.30]And get shower stuck.
[117:13.63]Even if I'm trying to not do it.
[117:16.98]And then after like a couple of minutes, I go, what the fuck?
[117:19.38]I'm still in here.
[117:21.20]Oh my God.
[117:25.21]It's really easy for me to get shower stuck.
[117:34.30]So I'll sit there and be counting in my head.
[117:37.63]One, two, three, four, five.
[117:41.29]While I'm brushing my teeth, shampoos in my hair with other hand, counting.
[117:46.68]And like I need to be out of there in like 180 seconds.
[118:04.27]Aggressive ADHD.
[118:10.21]Yeah.
[118:13.91]Three minute shower, Andy.
[118:15.19]Well, if you have somewhere to be, you know, I don't... I also have to be... I have to clean myself every day.
[118:21.77]I have to.
[118:22.45]I always... I just feel so gross.
[118:23.53]I just feel disgusting if I don't.
[118:40.35]Gross feeling Andy.
[118:41.57]Don't listen to all the one guys.
[118:49.21]I know what you mean.
[118:49.93]It's either 5 minutes or 30 minutes when you take a shower.
[119:00.26]Yeah, and why does that happen?
[119:04.13]Actually, it's not just going to be all green.
[119:05.65]We need accents, right?
[119:07.77]Yeah.
[119:08.89]What should I do?
[119:09.97]White?
[119:12.47]It seems to be a full green spray-painted house.
[119:19.05]Peach?
[119:20.55]Orange?
[119:21.19]White?
[119:21.69]Let's see.
[119:28.05]I'm not doing all green.
[119:36.28]We're closed!
[119:37.02]Why are people coming in here?
[119:40.64]Do you know what my uncle is?
[119:42.98]Shit.
[119:44.59]I'll clean it up later.
[119:52.06]I have not slept in four days.
[119:53.32]Are you supposed to sleep in this game?
[120:10.13]I think one of the worst things in the world is when you think you have, like, five to ten minutes or whatever.
[120:16.54]And then, okay, let's say somebody's, like, picking you up.
[120:18.72]Or, like, you have an appointment or something.
[120:22.00]Especially if you're on, like, somebody else's time, too.
[120:24.39]It can be, like, oh, shit.
[120:26.33]Like, I've gotten in the shower before.
[120:27.61]And the water just got hot, and I just got inside of it.
[120:32.47]And directly hit the water, hits the top of my head, and shampoo goes in.
[120:36.34]And I hear, like...
[120:41.39]And it's the person that is here to pick me up.
[120:44.33]And it's like, I can't even answer the phone.
[120:49.76]I can't even answer this phone call.
[120:52.10]So you try to get out of the shower while it's still running and you're covered in soap.
[120:55.30]Soap's going to your eyes.
[120:56.24]It's like burning.
[120:57.48]You grab like the end of a towel to wipe your hand off enough to be able to use the phone.
[121:01.63]And you answer it and pretend like you're not in the shower.
[121:04.59]Hey, what's up, man?
[121:06.75]Oh, hey, I'm outside.
[121:09.11]Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[121:10.37]I just gotta take care of a couple things.
[121:11.61]Just give me a couple minutes.
[121:14.87]All the while, your eyes are burning with soap.
[121:19.35]You're just in the shower, just sitting there.
[121:24.70]Then you make up some reason as to why.
[121:26.90]Yeah, I've got something I gotta do.
[121:29.60]Just real quick.
[121:30.28]Yeah, you caught me right at the second.
[121:31.20]Yeah, I'll be right out.
[121:39.75]Do you remember what the fuck you're talking about?
[121:40.89]Why is that not cleaned up?
[121:48.40]Do you live in a sitcom?
[121:51.60]No, this is real shit.
[121:54.79]That really happens.
[121:55.69]I have to brush it?
[122:04.15]I would not brush wet paint like this.
[122:11.32]This isn't doing anything.
[122:17.11]Why?
[122:17.77]How do I get rid of that?
[122:21.67]Repaint the column?
[122:31.51]What the hell?
[122:32.07]Brush the ground?
[122:39.34]Oh, please.
[122:39.94]Okay.
[122:46.76]Guys, there's a spider here.
[122:49.84]It is getting late.
[122:51.56]Yeah, I hear a spider.
[122:52.52]It's getting late.
[122:53.12]I don't have any torches.
[123:05.80]Yeah.
[123:06.74]Oh, yeah.
[123:07.68]Now that's a good one.
[123:18.72]Okay.
[123:19.04]Are you trying to tell me that that was not a good one?
[123:26.43]That's just the Minecraft spider sound.
[123:28.23]Do I have to explain all of my material?
[123:30.31]God, nobody gets me.
[123:44.83]I'm in a weird mood.
[123:46.27]Alright.
[123:47.43]I'm sorry.
[123:48.31]It's one of those weird mood days.
[123:54.55]Oh, fuck.
[123:58.29]Did anybody steal anything?
[124:00.07]This has been open the whole time.
[124:00.99]Come on.
[124:12.70]Don't do this to me right now.
[124:18.29]Don't do this to me right now.
[124:24.34]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[124:25.38]Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft.
[124:30.14]Jerma... I said it so weirdly.
[124:32.84]JermaCraft.
[124:35.60]Series where I play Minecraft.
[124:38.91]Whatever.
[124:39.21]Can this... Whatever.
[124:43.23]Just throw it.
[124:51.16]Went all the way over the mountain.
[124:54.94]Okay.
[125:05.09]How come nobody has sung that yet?
[125:07.27]Like a singing remix of it.
[125:11.25]And I'm talking real like power singing.
[125:17.32]Like, I need to impress everybody here by singing the national anthem.
[125:21.22]Power singing, you know what I mean?
[125:23.92]It's never just like, oh, say, can you see?
[125:27.23]Nope.
[125:28.75]It's like, oh, say, can you... They always have to make it... No, nobody just does it the normal way.
[125:41.37]Should I clear this out?
[125:47.69]Is this technically trash?
[125:51.45]Not really.
[125:53.69]Recycling.
[125:54.31]Shh.
[125:54.97]Recycling jokes.
[125:55.86]Shh.
[125:56.10]Stop.
[125:58.86]Don't you... Like, okay.
[126:00.50]Every year or two, a bunch of new people cycle into the channel.
[126:04.22]So we just do all the material we did two years ago.
[126:06.80]And it's brand new to everybody here.
[126:08.22]And they... Stop blowing this up for me.
[126:17.47]Yeah, I guess restore the warehouse.
[126:18.63]Okay.
[126:28.70]Dusty roads.
[126:36.73]Do I gotta go to the computer and turn the warehouse back on?
[126:39.25]That probably was dangerous.
[126:51.96]There's no material.
[126:53.10]You're just insane.
[126:57.30]That's not true.
[126:57.76]Hey.
[126:58.88]What do you mean?
[127:03.55]I'm seeing trues here.
[127:05.91]I'm seeing trues to that statement.
[127:16.15]This is all... Okay, I have to come in here and throw this... Wait, what?
[127:26.97]Oh my goodness.
[127:31.09]How did I not?
[127:35.73]I thought this was the wall.
[127:38.41]Wait.
[127:40.85]What's going on?
[127:41.77]Wasn't there a wall?
[127:44.43]I feel like I'm having an out-of-body experience.
[127:47.62]Oh, I upgraded.
[127:48.50]I was going to say, no way.
[127:50.06]Because everyone's like, you're blocking the door.
[127:51.34]What are you doing?
[127:51.76]What are you doing?
[127:52.18]I was like, okay, I'm fine.
[127:58.96]I need a little bit more trash.
[127:59.74]Can I just dump it?
[128:06.22]No.
[128:08.50]I need another little bit to get a bag.
[128:10.36]Come on.
[128:16.21]Come on!
[128:19.75]Trash on the roof?
[128:24.35]No.
[128:29.66]I don't think so.
[128:35.46]This is more than a simple weed brain.
[128:37.04]He's been molded like a Resident Evil 7 monster.
[128:39.79]From marijuana?
[128:43.69]Really, I kind of don't... I don't know what you mean by that.
[128:45.71]That's probably funny.
[128:46.73]Wait.
[128:51.53]Alright.
[128:52.77]Restore the... Alright, 50 bucks.
[129:03.27]Okay.
[129:04.87]Order additional products for sale.
[129:06.21]Ooh.
[129:08.27]Products.
[129:10.21]Here we go.
[129:11.56]You have several different brands of products on shelves.
[129:13.56]The customers will buy more things.
[129:15.48]Prices change every day at midnight.
[129:17.48]Renowns indicate a bargain price.
[129:18.78]Red mean the price is less favorable.
[129:21.68]You'll make profit regardless.
[129:22.99]However, the cheaper you buy, the more profit you'll make.
[129:24.95]Okay.
[129:27.27]Every day at midnight.
[129:31.76]You can track the price curve by looking at the price history.
[129:34.80]You can order only one delivery truck from each company at the same time.
[129:38.30]I was about to burp.
[129:39.86]Should I get alcohol?
[129:45.58]Cigarettes?
[129:49.90]It means strong menthol.
[129:55.11]This is super bland tobacco.
[129:56.85]Alright, cigarettes.
[130:00.83]What should I buy?
[130:04.24]Oh, this is times 10.
[130:06.87]Oh, I have 50 cartons of cigarettes.
[130:08.97]Okay.
[130:09.45]How about some, uh... How about some beer?
[130:15.27]Okay.
[130:18.73]I need to refill the snacks.
[130:22.45]I'm... I'm gonna be burning through money here.
[130:27.53]Okay.
[130:29.96]Sound good?
[130:34.89]Is that coming?
[130:35.87]Waiting for an order?
[130:36.51]Is that coming in?
[130:37.15]How do I say order?
[130:37.87]What is that?
[130:43.28]Order button?
[130:51.58]It's not this, right?
[130:52.46]Where is it?
[130:54.09]Up right?
[130:54.45]Oh, I thought that was a trash can.
[130:57.63]I thought that was like a delete button.
[131:00.71]Okay.
[131:00.83]Okay.
[131:06.02]I don't have enough warehouse capacity.
[131:10.72]Um... Okay, I don't need these things.
[131:17.40]Insufficient warehouse space.
[131:18.58]Fuck off.
[131:28.11]Wait for the delivery truck to arrive, then unpack the products into the warehouse.
[131:35.68]I need to move a lot of this shit out of the way.
[131:37.12]This is all trash, right?
[131:38.10]I can't sell this for anything.
[131:48.35]More shelves?
[131:48.95]I know, I know.
[131:49.80]I'm trying to move.
[131:50.42]I got a lot of shit here that I have to get rid of.
[131:53.58]I'm going for it.
[131:56.46]Don't worry.
[132:12.57]Somebody's going to take this trash.
[132:15.09]Someone's going to take this.
[132:16.92]Okay.
[132:19.88]Wait.
[132:23.36]Fuck.
[132:27.20]Can I unroll this carpet?
[132:28.30]It's so huge.
[132:32.24]Where's the truck?
[132:32.68]There it is.
[132:36.16]You're still closed, by the way?
[132:37.26]Yeah, good.
[132:37.56]I don't want to be open.
[132:39.59]You're making us sad?
[132:40.69]Jesus.
[132:43.53]Oh.
[132:45.85]I know.
[132:46.49]Hold on.
[132:49.69]Don't invoke the wrath of the broom.
[132:51.71]I'm telling you, don't do it.
[133:05.48]What are we...
[133:09.93]Okay.
[133:12.81]Unproc the... Is that... Oh, my God.
[133:19.54]There's so much.
[133:21.80]How much?
[133:22.30]Oh, no, no, no.
[133:22.68]Okay.
[133:26.86]Thanks.
[133:48.63]Let me get it, take me with you.
[133:54.47]Oh, what's this?
[133:55.03]Hey, hey, simple to guess.
[134:02.45]How close do you think I can get before it starts to burn?
[134:10.35]I can feel the air.
[134:26.96]What was that?
[134:29.74]Was that that kid?
[134:31.14]I think it was that kid.
[134:32.88]I just heard him.
[134:38.68]I heard somebody go like... You're out.
[134:44.61]You're fine.
[134:47.91]Go.
[134:48.47]Just go.
[134:52.71]Where's that kid?
[134:53.31]I heard him.
[134:56.76]Alright, we've refilled the shelves with products from the warehouse.
[135:00.56]So, do I have to grab it?
[135:02.56]Or is it just already there?
[135:09.76]Close this shit up.
[135:10.40]Don't want anybody stealing anything.
[135:15.18]Okay.
[135:22.26]I'm going to get a trash truck to come.
[135:27.14]Garbage collection.
[135:28.78]Thank you.
[135:32.18]We're getting worried about you.
[135:34.46]Why?
[135:35.82]I'm just messing around, man.
[135:39.28]We're just hanging out.
[135:40.26]Okay.
[135:41.10]I need to clear this stuff out back here because I want to move this.
[135:50.28]Where's the garbage truck?
[135:52.06]Coming soon?
[135:59.87]Doesn't matter if it's in there all the way, right?
[136:01.53]Remember, what would your last meal be?
[136:06.88]Uh, a buffalo chicken sub.
[136:11.78]With extra blue cheese.
[136:30.09]You had that ready?
[136:30.95]Yeah.
[136:32.25]Buffalo chicken is one of my favorite things in the world.
[136:37.85]Alright, I need to redo this.
[136:38.81]This is going to be where the food is.
[136:39.85]Right here.
[136:52.32]Never mind.
[136:54.21]Who's going to be over here?
[137:08.87]Good.
[137:10.73]Ah, it's not perfect till then.
[137:23.45]Good enough.
[137:27.45]This can go right at the door.
[137:28.55]+2 buffalo chicken, -2 blue cheese.
[137:32.69]What do you put on it then?
[137:35.93]I cannot eat buffalo anything.
[137:38.33]Just buffalo, buffalo.
[137:39.73]No.
[137:41.55]I like it, but it needs something on it.
[137:43.91]Ranch.
[137:44.27]No, we have ranch users here.
[137:54.06]Ranch on buffalo chicken and not blue cheese?
[137:57.14]Guys.
[138:01.90]Ranch is just like the...
[138:04.81]It's just like the not as good blue cheese to use on a buffalo sandwich.
[138:08.27]Or a buffalo chicken.
[138:13.94]If you're gonna do ranch, go all the way and do blue cheese.
[138:18.78]I mean, I guess ranch is a little lighter.
[138:20.92]But... What's blue cheese?
[138:24.38]Ranch is... I don't get the ranch thing.
[138:28.10]I don't.
[138:29.70]I think it's okay.
[138:30.10]Okay.
[138:32.30]But there are people that are like, oh man, ranch.
[138:34.38]Oh my god, I love ranch.
[138:35.90]It's the best.
[138:37.22]It's so good.
[138:38.00]I don't know.
[138:40.04]I don't really like it that much.
[138:50.26]It's time for some ranch.
[138:52.32]Yeah.
[138:54.18]He hates ranch.
[138:54.88]No, I don't.
[138:55.76]I like it.
[138:56.30]I think it's fine.
[138:56.88]Alright, I got... Where are my products?
[139:06.44]Is it in my inventory?
[139:10.06]Products.
[139:10.37]Here we go.
[139:11.79]Alright.
[139:13.13]We got these cigarettes.
[139:18.11]How do I... How do I do it?
[139:21.65]How do I get these?
[139:23.79]Cigarettes.
[139:24.13]How do I get them?
[139:24.91]Oh, here we go.
[139:31.98]How do I put cigarettes down?
[139:40.67]Refill the shelves of products.
[139:42.03]Go to the shelf and interact with the... Yeah, but how do I put the cigarettes?
[139:46.75]Different shelf?
[139:52.20]Oh, it's a different shelf.
[139:57.38]Different shelf for alcohol, too?
[140:00.09]What?
[140:03.89]I have $33.
[140:04.77]I have to... Oh, my God.
[140:05.91]I'm going to go bankrupt.
[140:15.69]Alright, cigarettes.
[140:18.96]Can't be behind me.
[140:19.62]Right here?
[140:20.66]It's sticking out.
[140:27.04]Alright, that's okay.
[140:29.76]No, this one, right?
[140:30.64]Jesus.
[140:42.29]Jesus.
[140:45.77]Okay, I need that alcohol shelf.
[140:48.55]Okay.
[140:58.72]You guys said I was getting not too much.
[141:05.26]This is not too much.
[141:10.27]There's only one popcorn?
[141:11.81]Wait, what?
[141:18.17]Alright, everything's restocked.
[141:23.27]If I come into this place and I see this shelf, I'm not going to buy anything in here.
[141:27.41]Because I feel like that it has never been restocked.
[141:30.43]And they don't restock until it goes to zero.
[141:32.69]It could be 10 years.
[141:36.36]I have 74.
[141:38.16]Alright, open it.
[141:41.20]Your uncle has words for you.
[141:42.34]What?
[141:42.54]What?
[141:47.07]Mm-hmm.
[142:03.28]Your uncle knows better how to keep a business going and wants to see you flourish.
[142:08.63]But my approval only goes so far.
[142:12.03]The real approval you need to watch out for is the one given to you by your customers.
[142:18.04]If word of slander gets out, you might even sell Egyptian diamonds for free, and nobody will bat an eye.
[142:26.22]popularity.
[142:28.78]Gather positive feedback from customers who increase the popularity of your station.
[142:32.58]Higher popularity increases traffic around your station, which increases the amount of customers coming by.
[142:37.24]Okay.
[142:40.39]Alright, so we're actually looking for Yelp reviews.
[142:45.41]I'm going to open it up.
[142:47.65]Open for business.
[142:48.17]Let's go.
[142:57.34]Ooh, clean this up.
[143:08.12]You can get more than one in one go.
[143:12.30]Alright, it's pretty clean in here.
[143:13.34]Okay.
[143:22.63]Looks pretty perfect.
[143:25.91]Ain't the inside...
[143:29.12]Can I?
[143:30.64]Oh, what color should I do?
[143:31.81]Uh, how about... What color should I do?
[143:35.75]Orange?
[143:36.03]Peach?
[143:38.35]No, not green.
[143:39.36]I'm not gonna do green.
[143:42.72]Ah!
[143:59.69]It's kinda ugly.
[144:09.37]I have to commit to it though, for now.
[144:11.75]Yup!
[144:12.69]Coming!
[144:14.87]One, two, three, four!
[144:20.98]We've got cigarettes!
[144:21.74]We've got snacks!
[144:22.44]We've got beer!
[144:25.56]I don't know.
[144:25.90]I'm fucked up today.
[144:26.76]I'm sorry.
[144:30.76]You can always tell when I'm in a fairly good mood.
[144:34.30]Based on how odd I am in front of everybody.
[144:40.97]Where is it?
[144:48.81]Is it a different color?
[144:49.43]Is this a different color?
[144:59.18]I can't tell.
[145:00.58]It might be.
[145:02.04]Is it?
[145:11.11]That's a different color.
[145:16.11]What are you looking for?
[145:19.22]You looking for the beer?
[145:20.32]The beer's right there.
[145:30.46]Not the right brand?
[145:31.22]Alright, what'd you get?
[145:40.33]Good choices.
[145:44.01]Good choices.
[145:45.73]Good choices.
[145:49.01]Alright, come on in.
[145:49.57]What do you got?
[145:54.56]Got a beer?
[145:55.24]Yep.
[145:56.26]And some snacks.
[145:57.42]Thanks for coming.
[146:00.06]Av, you have a wonderful day.
[146:05.67]I'll take care of that.
[146:06.43]Whoa.
[146:10.39]You're kidding.
[146:12.36]I went a little over.
[146:13.52]Look, I tried to stop.
[146:14.22]It didn't stop.
[146:14.60]Whatever.
[146:15.82]Who cares?
[146:29.26]No, the whole point of having a gas station out here is to make sure I can serve the customers that need some stuff, right?
[146:44.85]I gotta order some more fuel.
[146:45.97]More parking.
[146:48.19]Oh, shit.
[146:48.79]$3.99?
[146:48.81]That's too much.
[146:49.19]I need fuel.
[147:00.95]200, shit.
[147:01.23]Um... I'm... Fuck.
[147:15.49]Moon is huge.
[147:25.10]Dude, okay.
[147:26.03]Can I talk about this?
[147:26.67]This is the most nerve-wracking thing in the world.
[147:29.25]Some fast food restaurants do this now.
[147:31.73]Where you order with the person that's like walking and running with your car.
[147:35.43]I hate it.
[147:36.65]It freaks me out.
[147:37.09]I'm not ready.
[147:43.19]Chick-fil-A, yeah.
[147:46.39]It was so much anxiety-inducing.
[147:48.61]I was just like, what the fuck?
[147:50.25]Because I don't, okay.
[147:52.27]I usually don't know what I want when I go anywhere.
[147:55.89]I usually don't, I usually kind of figure that out.
[147:58.33]I look at like a menu, whatever.
[147:59.53]And this person's holding up a laminated menu, walking with the car.
[148:04.71]I'm just like, what the fuck is going on?
[148:08.43]I don't, I have to drive the car.
[148:10.70]I have to drive the car.
[148:21.90]Because there's just like 700,000 people that go to Chick-fil-A.
[148:28.89]Every, I don't, okay.
[148:30.91]I know that like, okay, Chick-fil-A, right?
[148:32.53]Oh, they've got good chicken.
[148:33.63]It's, okay, it's good.
[148:34.91]It's good.
[148:36.71]But this car, it's just like, what the hell is going on here?
[148:39.63]There's like 50 cars in line all day.
[148:54.43]I would just go to McDonald's.
[148:56.61]I'm just going to drive by that, you know what I mean?
[148:58.39]It's like, holy shit, this is like ridiculous.
[149:06.50]Oh, come here.
[149:13.04]You're looking for... There's beer.
[149:14.24]You're looking... He just... Isn't that the exact beer that he just said he wanted?
[149:26.21]I went to Chick-fil-A and In-N-Out today.
[149:27.95]Yeah, In-N-Out's the same way.
[149:29.21]In-N-Out's just, there's so many people.
[149:33.38]It's always there.
[149:34.10]Come on, come on.
[149:41.80]Come on.
[149:54.64]Yo, me, $5.
[149:55.76]In-N-Out is overrated.
[149:59.14]Be careful.
[150:00.28]Be careful.
[150:00.76]I said that before.
[150:03.58]And I was nearly killed.
[150:05.86]Be careful.
[150:06.28]Don't say that.
[150:16.13]The chat chimpanzees were not happy about that.
[150:18.65]I don't have enough money for this.
[150:28.02]I, all I said, listen, all I said was that I, I, I, when I order food from In-N-Out, why do they put it like in a half open bag?
[150:44.62]If I'm not eating in the restaurant, wrap the whole thing, wrap the sandwich up.
[150:48.94]I don't want it in a half open bag.
[151:01.39]Have you ever had Whataburger?
[151:02.41]No, I haven't.
[151:03.05]I've never had Whataburger.
[151:03.85]I've always wanted to, but I never had an opportunity.
[151:08.72]Who's beeping?
[151:16.16]And actually, okay, it could be time for me to do an updated tier list.
[151:19.05]Because I feel like I've eaten a lot of the fast foods I have not had before.
[151:24.03]For instance...
[151:26.39]I think I mentioned this before, but holy shit, Jack in the Box is unbelievably good.
[151:33.56]I couldn't believe it.
[151:34.24]I was like, this is fucking unbelievable.
[151:36.24]I was like, what?
[151:38.05]I've only had that maybe once in my whole life before I had it before.
[151:40.63]And I was like, yeah, it's okay.
[151:43.51]Dude, I had their burger and I was like, this is like good.
[151:45.77]This is like really good.
[151:47.95]What is going on?
[152:01.48]it's underrated but it's not that good I think I okay I think my brain was expecting it to be terrible but when I realized it wasn't terrible my brain put it up like three tiers what I mean great job
[152:27.64]Your tacos are horrendous.
[152:30.96]I mean, I kind of... Kind of like those.
[152:33.18]I kind of like those.
[152:40.06]But, whatever.
[152:41.10]Wait, somebody hit the gas pump.
[152:46.03]I am almost out of gas.
[152:58.04]Cigarettes and beer.
[152:59.43]Have a nice day.
[153:00.81]Okay.
[153:05.29]Buy a toilet.
[153:07.63]Not yet.
[153:11.83]Need that.
[153:23.08]Try Boston Market.
[153:25.82]Um, I've had Boston Market, I think, a handful of times over my life.
[153:29.68]I remember it was good, but they're not really out here.
[153:33.12]I don't think there's a Boston Market out here.
[153:37.32]Could be wrong, but I don't think so.
[153:39.07]Is that fuel here?
[153:43.05]Please finish painting.
[153:52.52]You got it.
[154:05.22]Fuck, I was looking at chat.
[154:06.60]My bad.
[154:06.92]What is the cop doing?
[154:12.47]Did he get out of his car?

[155:11.97]Okay.
[155:23.64]Fuel's here.

[155:33.46]Just turn and do a three-point- You're gonna have to wait.
[155:44.57]Thank you.
[155:48.33]Alright.
[155:48.75]Finish the paint job.
[155:52.96]Actually looks terrible.
[155:57.36]Okay, that don't matter.
[156:17.16]Yeah, I know I need a bathroom.

[159:23.04]You want to paint the roof, like, teal?
[159:33.65]I think it looks nice.
[159:41.39]I don't care what you say.
[159:42.40]You're a Slytherin.
[160:06.99]You have customers?

[160:24.84]You bring a dog in here?
[160:28.35]What happened?
[160:40.70]You have millennial humor?
[160:44.28]Um... I just want to make sure that you're aware of this.
[160:51.56]I'm... I'm a millennial.
[160:57.66]I think I probably... That's how old I am.
[161:06.21]Oh my god.
[161:07.05]Gasp.
[161:18.64]Wipe your feet before you come in here.
[161:19.82]Come on.
[161:20.44]What is this?
[161:25.88]Millennial humor.
[161:27.10]What kind of humor do you like?
[161:29.88]What's your humor?
[161:44.40]Zoomer humor?
[161:52.83]Zoomer humor is interesting to me because I either hate it completely or I think it's hysterical.
[162:01.48]There's no in-between for me with, like, kind of Gen Z's humor.
[162:23.44]Can you buy something?
[162:34.45]Alright, come on.
[162:41.37]Wait, you first.
[162:48.82]Please don't rant about how popular you'd be on TikTok, please.
[162:53.84]I'm not gonna do that.
[162:54.94]Don't worry.
[162:56.20]We're not doing that right now.
[163:04.15]I was not about to.
[163:05.43]No, I'm full of shit.
[163:07.07]Don't worry.
[163:07.51]If there's one thing that you guys can know, and you probably already do, is you know, I'm full of shit.
[163:14.44]You know what I mean?
[163:15.38]Like, I just am.
[163:22.74]What was I doing?
[163:27.55]Okay, do I have enough for a bathroom?
[163:34.68]Toilet.
[163:35.56]How much is this?
[163:36.38]50 bucks, that's it?
[163:37.02]Okay, sure.
[163:37.88]Make it.
[163:43.36]Do a funny sound effect.
[163:46.15]Is that... Do you like that?
[164:03.27]That was so funny.
[164:04.19]You guys are fucking so funny.
[164:13.47]Okay, what, uh... I didn't mean that sarcastically either.
[164:16.63]I really believe that.
[164:18.81]Alright, uh... I don't need a loan.
[164:20.35]I have a toilet now.
[164:26.33]I have to clean the toilet?
[164:28.12]Where is it?
[164:37.12]I don't even know where it is.
[164:38.06]Excuse me, where's your bathroom?
[164:40.34]I don't know.
[164:41.54]It's somewhere attached to this building.
[164:45.20]Put new floors in?
[164:47.28]Maybe eventually.
[164:47.83]Did the weed kick in?
[164:53.21]Oh, a little bit.
[164:54.15]Somewhat.
[164:59.73]I'm kidding.
[165:02.84]There's 15,000 people here?
[165:03.72]Holy shit.
[165:07.99]Hi.
[165:11.53]Alright, so they want... Okay, they want different beer.
[165:16.63]I need to order... People keep asking for this one.
[165:22.00]And this one's expensive.
[165:23.30]Okay, don't go overboard here, but people keep asking for these.
[165:28.72]How much is it going to cost?
[165:32.24]100 bucks?
[165:33.26]Give it a go.
[165:36.88]Ew, they keep asking for the same beer.
[165:41.90]Clean the toilet.
[165:43.18]No one's even used it.
[165:49.52]Nobody's used the bathroom.
[165:52.52]Why would I need to clean the bathroom?
[165:58.08]What the f- What the fuck?
[165:59.81]Excuse me?
[166:00.03]Um, excuse me.
[166:05.62]Why is there a big shit log on the ground?
[166:09.67]I just opened this, what?
[166:15.81]Oh, don't pick it up with your hands!
[166:18.63]Oh my god, that's disgusting!
[166:25.46]Do not touch that with your hands!
[166:27.18]No, oh no!
[166:31.58]I didn't wash my hands.
[166:34.25]I'll use the sponge.
[166:41.53]I want to let you know I didn't wash my hands and I was just in the bathroom.
[166:44.93]I want you to know.
[166:46.75]So make sure you wash your hands too.
[166:49.57]That's disgusting.
[166:50.43]What the... What am I doing?
[166:55.75]Would you just put it all back?
[166:56.77]I don't even know what I would do.
[167:00.41]If somebody said that...
[167:04.35]Yeah, have a nice day.
[167:05.09]Oh, by the way, I did not wash my hands, but I just used the bathroom.
[167:08.77]You'd be like, okay, well, I want a fucking refund.
[167:10.67]And I'm washing my hands in your sink five times.
[167:20.20]And I want you to give me $20.
[167:22.50]I want you to give me $20.
[167:23.50]And the health inspector's going to get here, too.
[167:34.14]Oh, okay.
[167:34.64]You're throwing... For some reason, I thought she was saying, like, let's go.
[167:37.81]Like, let's throw down.
[167:38.73]Like, she was, like, pointing down.
[167:40.01]Like, let's go.
[167:40.95]You and me, right here.
[167:42.77]Delivery truck.
[167:43.81]Shit.
[167:48.69]Coming.
[167:58.68]I don't have time for this.
[168:00.30]Thanks for coming.
[168:00.90]Appreciate it.
[168:02.95]I'll get out.
[168:04.51]Bye.
[168:05.97]Thanks.
[168:07.71]Have a good day.
[168:17.00]Here, have a few bags of potatoes or whatever, rice, whatever this is.
[168:36.41]Howdy.
[168:37.60]Fresh beer?
[168:38.70]You got it.
[168:39.08]Alright.
[168:45.82]I'm making money.
[168:48.52]Door.
[168:48.76]The warehouse door.
[168:49.32]Yep.
[168:49.96]Shit.
[168:57.95]Bee hopping doesn't work.
[169:00.27]Shit.
[169:00.85]I'm in trouble.
[169:01.67]Usually I get around games like that.
[169:12.95]Is that in games anymore?
[169:16.03]It's not, right?
[169:16.61]Because that was essentially a broken piece of code that people used.
[169:19.84]People don't put bee-hopping in first-person shooters anymore, do they?
[169:30.78]Boomer shooters still have it?
[169:32.65]Hmm.
[169:38.73]What's your guys' favorite boomer shooter?
[169:39.95]I feel like I want to know what the crowd has to say about this.
[169:44.04]What is yours?
[169:51.69]Money.
[169:58.21]I don't think TF2 is a boomer shooter.
[170:11.65]I mean, maybe a little bit.
[170:17.70]Back to cigarettes.
[170:18.38]That's 20 bucks.
[170:23.50]You know, this is bad for you.
[170:25.77]It's so bad for you.
[170:27.09]You should quit smoking.
[170:38.54]Did you read the Surgeon General warning on the back?
[170:40.45]I just want to make sure you did.
[170:41.67]Did you read the Surgeon General's warning?
[170:43.79]Yep.
[170:44.95]Just making sure you did.
[170:46.67]Those are not good for you.
[170:47.47]Those are bad for you.
[170:47.95]You're here for gas?
[171:00.57]Oh.
[171:02.35]I'm almost out of fuel.
[171:08.10]Need to restock the shelves too.
[171:15.21]Hey, there you go.
[171:15.73]Now you have some variety.
[171:25.39]The toilet.
[171:30.79]Oh, we just in there?
[171:39.75]Ugh.
[171:40.33]That's not how you clean up that.
[171:42.57]Okay.
[171:53.11]Get rid of the rest of this trash.
[171:58.53]I can't use that brush anywhere else.
[172:14.61]Alright, we're going to paint this white.
[172:20.99]It's a bathroom.
[172:21.73]It's going to look clean.
[172:24.65]Fresh.
[172:38.87]Buy a workshop from the main PC hub.
[172:41.07]There's a lot more to this game than I thought there was going to be.
[172:45.31]I came into this game without... I'm... I shouldn't be in here.
[172:51.50]It's being painted?
[172:52.32]Have a nice day.
[173:09.17]Can I even go in there and paint that?
[173:11.15]I don't think I can.
[173:21.93]I painted.
[173:23.25]Looks like I can, but can't open the doors here.
[173:25.47]Oh, I can.
[173:31.56]Alright.
[173:31.80]That's kind of a weird setup, though.
[173:52.80]Customers, customers, customers.
[173:54.26]I know.
[173:55.16]I'm going.
[174:01.56]Sorry for the wait.
[174:02.02]He said to paint the bathroom.
[174:04.02]What do you got?
[174:09.32]Have a nice day.
[174:13.62]Have your cigarettes.
[174:21.01]So like passive-aggressive with it right now.
[174:25.19]Like I'm selling them.
[174:26.35]Yeah, like what am I talking about?
[174:35.78]Thanks a lot.
[174:37.48]Almost out of gas.
[174:55.42]Trash.
[174:58.22]Thanks for coming.
[174:58.78]Bathroom's clean.
[175:12.85]Somebody said poop.
[175:13.79]Ha ha ha ha.
[175:16.01]I'm glad you think it's funny.
[175:23.33]Can I even paint this back wall?
[175:26.68]I don't think I can.
[175:27.42]I want to paint the back wall.
[175:36.23]Can I not?
[175:40.01]Did we have a raid?
[175:41.07]Did we?
[175:41.35]I don't see a raid.
[175:44.61]Make that up.
[175:52.72]You made that up.
[175:57.37]You made that up.
[176:05.97]Alright, well, whatever.
[176:17.28]This stuff is so boarded up.
[176:18.30]I have to take care of that.
[176:22.20]How do I take these boards off?
[176:27.16]I can't.
[176:36.55]Paint the dumpster.
[176:38.47]I can't.
[176:41.91]Buy more fuel.
[176:45.62]Ooh.
[176:45.84]I don't know what that is, but I can't afford it.
[176:54.51]Customers?
[176:55.31]I'm here.
[176:55.98]I'm ready.
[177:01.62]Looking for any stray trash.
[177:06.80]Trash, trash, trash.
[177:07.84]Nope.
[177:08.14]Okay.
[177:18.52]Is everyone going to the bathroom?
[177:20.65]Are there two people
[177:34.07]Where is everybody?
[177:34.65]I need to tell people about this place so more people come so I can have more orders.
[177:39.92]Well, you gotta wait.
[178:05.67]I got a big combo going.
[178:13.50]Only one more seagull, huh?
[178:18.91]What?
[178:19.27]Oh.
[178:40.65]See you later.
[178:41.07]Thanks for the fuel.
[178:45.45]Alright.
[178:46.45]I need... Features.
[178:51.71]No, I need to make some more money.
[178:55.27]I need 300 bucks to restore that thing.
[179:06.52]Evening.
[179:08.55]In here.
[179:08.81]How much you need?
[179:10.61]Oops.
[179:12.99]I didn't mean to click it twice.
[179:14.13]I just want to get up on the roof.
[179:30.86]Does he even know I'm on here?
[179:55.35]Where are we going?
[180:02.40]I'm going to do this because, yeah.
[180:07.70]I'm terrified about this.
[180:10.08]What will happen?
[180:17.57]Come on.
[180:25.18]From downtown.
[180:26.80]Ugly shot.
[180:38.49]I love that game.
[180:44.99]I could play that game for like the next hundred years and be fine.
[180:48.06]Is that like important?
[180:58.72]It's not like my luggage or anything, right?
[181:06.02]He's heating up.
[181:13.20]Yeah, when you got on fire, you just steal the ball and shoot from anywhere on the court.
[181:17.35]Make your friends go mad.
[181:21.81]Steal the ball.
[181:24.39]And you would shoot the fireball and you'd sink it every time.
[181:32.29]Oh my god, you're buying a lot of shit.
[181:33.95]Good.
[181:35.65]Nice.
[181:43.92]Okay, I need 300.
[181:53.78]These are the expensive ones.
[181:55.54]They're like 10 bucks a bottle.
[182:01.14]You imitate the sounds of shoes squeaking on a basketball court.
[182:03.99]Yeah.
[182:18.11]Great.
[182:24.35]Are there any other requests?
[182:32.75]Alright, 250.
[182:33.89]I need 300.
[182:40.14]Emulate my father coming home.
[182:43.90]Hey, kid.
[182:46.38]It's me.
[182:47.98]Your dear old dad.
[182:51.24]Why's your report card look?
[182:53.53]Oh, you got a B minus in science.
[182:55.85]I had bad time in science too, son.
[183:03.22]Don't worry about it.
[183:15.77]I heard that little shit kid.
[183:17.41]Where is he?
[183:19.87]I'm going to spray him.
[183:21.68]Where is he?
[183:22.00]I heard him.
[183:22.46]Where is he?
[183:34.70]Is he in the bathroom?
[183:38.62]I don't know where this kid is.
[183:40.24]Get out of here!
[184:07.51]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[184:08.71]Yeah, do you see what's going on with kids these days?
[184:13.33]What's going on with kids?
[184:14.23]What's going on here?
[184:14.97]$20.
[184:14.99]$20.
[184:15.97]How much do I owe you?
[184:27.54]$8.
[184:27.82]Yeah, I don't know what's going on with kids, man.
[184:40.17]Honestly.
[184:50.93]Sweep the floor.
[184:52.59]Oh, shit.
[185:00.21]The Minecraft spider joke, I think, was a 10 out of 10.
[185:05.39]I can't believe nobody liked that.
[185:07.43]I'm shocked.
[185:21.96]Awesome.
[185:27.05]Okay.
[185:28.19]How's my inventory?
[185:28.89]Still pretty good.
[185:32.79]Plenty of cigarette batteries.
[185:34.67]Tomorrow I'm on fuel.
[185:37.31]I need another few customers and I can do the workshop.
[185:42.69]I have to take care of the paint.
[185:44.61]What did he write?
[185:46.71]He wrote like, fuck you.
[185:49.39]Or is it?
[186:02.54]Hmm, where is it?
[186:03.86]Yeah.
[186:05.02]Fuck school.
[186:05.94]Is this supposed to be in school?
[186:12.96]Fuck school?
[186:25.94]What are you getting?
[186:27.67]Finally, somebody actually orders a half tank of gas.
[186:35.42]Alright, workshop time.
[186:36.50]Restore.
[186:36.84]How many saltines can you fit in your mouth at the same time?
[186:46.71]Probably two.
[186:48.11]I mean, probably more than that, but why would you do that?
[186:49.75]It's kind of dangerous.
[186:50.87]It's, like, bad.
[186:51.73]Alright.
[186:54.78]Wait for the client in the workshop and fix his car?
[187:00.42]Wait, I'm a mechanic now?
[187:01.60]What?
[187:06.46]Wait for the customer to leave the car and press the button on the left to start the repairs.
[187:11.41]Use your skills to see which areas require your attention.
[187:15.77]Before you start repairing, make sure you have enough spare parts and the right tool in your hand.
[187:20.43]Restocking car parts is done the exact same way as ordering new products to tell.
[187:24.78]Use the delivery tab on your PC.
[187:27.62]Well, shit.
[187:35.34]I'm gonna have to do this a little bit later.
[187:36.70]I need to make money.
[187:46.56]No, not yet.
[187:46.96]I can stay.
[187:49.18]How we doing?
[187:49.60]Alright.
[187:52.69]You're the kind of person that eats Doritos vertically.
[188:02.80]When they're 3D, you're in a 3D world.
[188:04.69]Doritos 3D.
[188:07.57]Crunch the power.
[188:16.14]Uh-oh.
[188:21.53]I don't know why.
[188:22.09]Okay.
[188:22.35]I don't know why I do this thing where I'm like deliberately trying to make you hate me.
[188:27.81]You know what I mean?
[188:28.27]Like why?
[188:29.73]I find it's kind of humorous.
[188:32.26]But I don't want anyone to actually really hate me.
[188:35.58]So maybe I should cut back on those.
[188:38.04]On those please deliberately hate my guts references.
[188:48.63]Okay, wait for the client.
[188:49.63]I don't think I have enough.
[188:50.73]Can I not fix it?
[188:51.21]I don't think I can fix this person's car.
[188:52.35]Is it you?
[188:52.75]Alright, what's wrong with it?
[189:14.73]What's wrong with your car?
[189:19.32]Are you going into the repair shop?
[189:23.96]The repair shop is that way.
[189:32.67]This is how we go real fast.
[189:43.17]One of us is gonna puke and it ain't gonna be me.
[190:04.89]Alright, I'm out.
[190:05.85]Get me out.
[190:11.61]You have unread mail?
[190:16.47]Yeah, you know what I do with mail?
[190:18.22]You know what I do with mail?
[190:19.54]I don't know.
[190:20.80]I shred it.
[190:21.90]That would have been funnier if I didn't start doing that weird voice.
[190:33.79]I don't know why people send so much shit.
[190:37.09]I really don't.
[190:38.75]Why?
[190:39.09]What's the point?
[190:39.77]People send so much junk.
[190:46.96]Have you guys seen those pretend invoices?
[190:50.10]You've seen these yet?
[190:50.76]Bugs, huh?
[190:56.60]Where it's like this piece of paper that's filled out as if you had potentially ordered a product.
[191:02.74]Or like, oh here, here's like this, we're going to do that, we're going to be doing this, we're going to be doing this.
[191:07.09]And it's signed at the bottom by like the guy.
[191:12.19]The owner of the company or whatever.
[191:13.31]And you look at it and you're like, wait, what the, what is this?
[191:17.39]And it looks like it's on paper, like written paper.
[191:20.27]It's really weird.
[191:23.81]It's a good advertising technique to be like, well, this is what your invoice could look like if you used B&A Stevenson.
[191:35.11]Oh, my God.
[191:35.45]Somebody in the garage.
[191:43.92]Hi.
[191:45.08]How can I help you?
[191:47.96]Something wrong with the power steering?
[191:50.24]Yeah, power steering.
[191:52.32]Sometimes it's fluid.
[191:54.13]Sometimes it's, um... Why do I have a timer?
[192:05.95]I need a new car battery?
[192:07.28]I don't have any of this stuff.

[192:28.69]Okay.
[192:29.07]I'm going to use the saw a little bit.
[192:35.89]I don't have any materials.
[192:36.93]It's immune.
[192:43.50]It's immune.
[192:49.75]Oh shit, people just register.
[192:50.77]How am I supposed to do all this?
[193:02.51]You need more CPU thermal paste, yeah.
[193:10.92]Alright, I have to buy a bunch of shit?
[193:19.46]Products?
[193:21.96]Car care?
[193:22.85]I need to be level 3.
[193:23.69]Car care?
[193:38.74]Alright.
[193:45.90]So, I need to buy a car battery?
[193:54.04]I don't understand.
[193:54.66]I need tire?
[193:59.06]Need new mirror to start fixing old mirror.
[194:02.17]Need wheel.
[194:03.99]And need scratch remover.
[194:07.35]Where am I supposed to get all this stuff?
[194:13.53]Use the delivery tab on the PC.
[194:19.22]It's on the wall?
[194:20.00]That's not it.
[194:24.59]Tires are here?
[194:25.41]What are you talking about?
[194:29.75]You have them?
[194:38.65]What is a fusion?
[194:40.55]What is a fusion?
[194:41.77]I don't have car parts.
[194:52.67]Oh.
[195:04.93]Okay.
[195:11.71]Stick it on there.
[195:16.69]Cool.
[195:19.24]Need a car door.
[195:21.12]Scratch remover.
[195:21.78]Where is it?
[195:22.68]Oh, it's this.
[195:23.56]It's the stupid thing I was doing.
[195:32.50]Okay.
[195:34.14]And what else we got?
[195:37.31]You need a mirror.
[195:40.05]You need a car mirror.
[195:42.35]Here we go.
[195:48.72]Ow, my finger.
[195:51.22]Okay, that'll be $1,700.
[195:51.98]What, are you going to do it yourself?
[195:56.64]Nope.
[195:56.82]You're fucked.
[195:59.17]You're fucked.
[196:14.22]Need to order car parts.
[196:15.12]I don't have enough money to do any of that yet.
[196:22.32]Do people have to register?
[196:30.85]Nobody's getting gas.
[196:32.85]Do I have a really bad reputation for gas or something?
[196:35.16]How come there's no cars been pulled up?
[196:47.52]No.
[196:48.64]Lifesavers are under the register.
[196:51.88]I'll see you again soon.
[196:53.38]Take it easy.
[196:53.96]Take it easy, Jake.
[196:56.57]Thanks for coming in again, Mike.
[197:01.11]That's how you get the good reviews.
[197:10.79]Car parts function identical to purchasing products.
[197:13.16]Prices change every day, yeah.
[197:14.92]Green hours indicate bargain price, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[197:20.24]I already have plenty of these.
[197:22.33]I've wasted like three of them.
[197:41.09]How much do you need?
[197:44.75]Ryan, what are you plus doing?
[197:47.61]Keep the floor.
[197:57.04]What are you guys... What are you tracking in?
[197:58.68]Probably should clean the bathroom too, right?
[198:07.91]Probably a good idea.
[198:13.75]Can you take a potty break?
[198:14.83]Um, yeah, we'll take a break in a minute.
[198:16.95]Get some water.
[198:22.43]Uh, 400 bucks.
[198:23.11]Alright, I'm slowly accumulating money, though.
[198:24.71]That's a good thing.
[198:25.23]It's been three hours?
[198:38.00]Come on in.
[198:43.32]I need to get some more food.
[198:44.34]I think that's important.
[198:45.84]No, I need to... I don't even know.
[198:47.32]I need more money.
[198:49.79]My reputation's pretty high.
[198:50.81]Oh, I gotta clean that bathroom before you go in there.
[198:53.87]Don't go in.
[198:54.19]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[198:56.31]Oh, fuck.
[198:56.73]Whatever.
[199:09.88]Anything from Sonic?
[199:13.02]Um, no, not really.
[199:14.28]I know people looking for Pringles and yeah, I know.
[199:32.03]Do you have any soap dispensers?
[199:43.33]I don't think I can buy them.
[199:46.55]Once I get over 600 bucks, I'm going to start ordering new stuff.
[199:53.63]Nice.
[199:57.13]The only snack you have are those awful little Debbie cakes.
[200:02.81]Why did I just throw that in the trash?
[200:09.46]Any more fuel?
[200:13.24]Yeah, I do.
[200:16.67]That's essential, so I'm going to buy it.
[200:17.93]Are you high?
[200:27.97]No.
[200:30.45]I'm really not.
[200:39.76]I have no more products.
[200:51.96]Please, when are you going to do more tier lists?
[200:53.56]They're objectively your best content.
[200:59.58]I mean, I did them all.
[201:02.00]All the ones everybody wanted, you know?
[201:03.26]Cereal, fast food, snacks, drinks, cheese.
[201:07.44]I did pretty much all of them.
[201:13.14]Pretty much all the ones that people would want to see.
[201:18.67]Seasoning tier list?
[201:23.70]That's- alright, that's- you've piqued my interest a little.
[201:42.51]Okay, the... truck is here?
[201:56.63]Do tier lists after the break.
[201:59.08]No, I'm not doing tier lists right now.
[202:07.68]Maybe we'll do that in the middle of the week.
[202:09.66]Okay, I'll find some more quizzes and tier lists and stuff.
[202:12.42]Maybe we'll do that on Wednesday.
[202:13.32]We'll see.
[202:18.41]You gotta give me some good ones.
[202:19.77]Some ones that I haven't done.
[202:20.87]And maybe I would go back and do one that I've done already because my opinions may have changed.
[202:31.02]And the recommended channel in the Discord.
[202:34.13]An opportunity for you to say, you know, what you think would be a good one.
[202:46.73]Garage?
[202:47.19]Is somebody in here?
[202:52.02]Shit, somebody is in here.
[202:59.12]Alright, you need a... What's wrong with it?
[203:00.99]Alright, scratch remover.

[203:15.58]Jeez.
[203:19.06]Okay, what else?
[203:19.78]Need a new tire.
[203:29.35]I love that sound.
[203:29.91]There's a werewolf attack.
[203:41.23]That's a lot of money.
[203:42.63]Wow.
[203:44.21]This is really worth doing.
[203:45.53]Almost 200 bucks.
[203:58.81]Oh shit, I wasn't paying attention.
[203:59.57]I was bunny hopping.
[204:10.28]There we go.

[205:13.08]How much do I owe you? 30.
[205:29.84]Do you have a lack of charging ports at your station?
[205:35.51]This is the part of the movie where all the country guys look back and forth at each other, sitting around, and they all go, What are you talking about?
[205:48.43]Charging port?
[205:51.52]Are you going to go up in a spaceship?
[205:54.58]It's supposed to be a really funny part of the movie.
[206:07.01]You're doing Pawn Stars again.
[206:08.35]This is not Pawn Stars.
[206:09.22]This is me running a gas station.
[206:15.54]What?
[206:21.78]These cars are really small.
[206:37.33]The garage.
[206:40.17]I'll get back to you.
[206:43.19]Where's the garage?
[206:44.28]It's over here.

[207:08.41]Internet.

[207:16.57]Alright, I need to... I need to stop doing that.
[207:21.83]I'm like so energetic today.
[207:24.05]Why?
[207:24.45]Just relax.
[207:25.27]It's alright, man.
[207:26.69]What am I doing?
[207:28.94]I'm just so excited for nothing.
[207:31.14]I don't even know why.
[207:36.63]Alright, what do you need?
[207:38.19]Two tires and a mirror.
[207:39.93]Let's just relax.
[207:42.19]YouTuber Andy.
[207:43.20]I know.
[207:43.64]I've never... It's the YouTuber in me.
[207:55.46]It's good to be excited.
[207:59.21]Yeah, it's fun.
[208:05.13]Over here?
[208:12.20]No umbrellas allowed in the waiting room.
[208:14.08]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[208:15.92]Oh.
[208:17.93]Oh, no.
[208:20.57]You guys know the rule of the channel, right?
[208:23.63]How this all works.
[208:26.31]After a week of not playing the game, it's gone.
[208:31.23]Shit.
[208:34.70]Yeah, that's actually true.
[208:38.92]That's actually true.
[208:55.58]Alright, I got plenty of money.
[208:57.42]It's time to start upgrading.
[209:07.61]I'm coming.
[209:13.88]That's actually not true.
[209:19.10]What about the movies in House Flipper?
[209:21.44]I think some games...
[209:24.51]do not qualify for that just because I love them so much.
[209:28.73]30 bucks.
[209:38.85]Nice.
[209:40.55]Oh, is this place dirty?
[209:41.29]OK, nice and clean.
[209:55.51]Looks good.
[209:56.41]Alright.
[209:57.47]Now I've got 800 bucks.
[210:01.41]I need to... Gas station level 3.
[210:03.73]Complete more objectives to be able to upgrade the gas station.
[210:07.47]What are my objectives?
[210:08.81]Order car parts.
[210:09.63]Okay.
[210:13.61]I'll order... Oh, these are expensive this week.
[210:17.75]Order one of these.
[210:19.01]And one of these.
[210:19.53]Okay.
[210:22.17]That's very expensive.
[210:29.43]Oh, it goes to the warehouse.
[210:30.52]Are you going to stream Elden Ring when it comes out?
[210:40.52]I would assume, probably.
[210:41.42]I don't see why not.
[210:45.25]I always play the new FromSoftware games on stream.
[210:48.79]I just hope it's not as hard as Sekiro was.
[210:51.21]My gamer skill is on sort of a curve.
[210:57.90]Where every six months now, I lose an extra step in my gamer skill.
[211:05.42]So, I don't know.
[211:06.42]It's going to be tough.
[211:14.83]I did see the new gameplay trailer.
[211:29.52]You have games that you won't play on stream because you want to enjoy them without 10,000 backseat gamers?
[211:36.08]Uh, yeah, I mean, there is something to be said of playing something off stream for me just to kind of do whatever.
[211:43.43]Potentially just be awful at.
[211:47.03]Or to just keep my mouth open and sit there and not say anything.
[211:52.64]Right?
[211:56.32]But, no, those games are fun to stream.
[212:06.78]Thank you.
[212:52.02]Customer.
[212:52.88]Oh, no.
[212:59.10]Refill the shelves in the workshop with the car parts.
[213:02.92]Can I just do that?
[213:11.11]I feel like my favorite games would be really bad ones to stream.
[213:17.63]Um, yeah, I mean.
[213:20.25]Streaming for me.
[213:23.50]Has always sort of been, and YouTube was like this too.
[213:27.18]I had the most fun when whoever was watching, whether it be on a live broadcast or a video that I edited or whatever, that we would collectively think something was fun or funny.
[213:41.83]Or, you know, something was interesting.
[213:44.40]So the prospect of just kind of playing a game for me at this point is interesting to me on my own.
[213:52.32]But I think like on-stream kind of stuff, I have the most fun when I'm doing stuff like this.
[213:58.00]I'm just talking and just fucking around.
[214:00.68]You guys are cracking jokes.
[214:03.14]Cracking jokes, you know what I mean?
[214:05.42]I have the most fun like this.
[214:07.59]Just hanging out and fucking around.
[214:09.49]Or doing like a big project.
[214:11.17]That's where I have the most fun.
[214:15.89]I was worried we'd be stranded.
[214:20.75]to live here a lot apparently well I don't think this is from my understanding this is a a long sort of abandoned road I don't know I mean I think I'm like one of the only gas stations this is ugly this is a very ugly house
[214:52.24]Uh, it was gray.
[215:01.09]It's a yeehaw town?
[215:02.43]Why is this a different color?
[215:03.33]Is it the light?
[215:12.46]What color is this?
[215:16.70]Remember the warehouse?
[215:17.32]The warehouse.
[215:18.72]No, this is correct.
[215:27.06]You know, like, okay.
[215:31.14]I've never lived in an environment where... I just fell off the roof.
[215:39.25]I've never lived in an environment that was less like technology and more kind of like just local stores and more like country.
[215:48.05]I feel like it would be kind of an interesting experience.
[215:50.25]Close the warehouse.
[215:54.34]Close the warehouse.
[216:05.16]it's not rural rural rural I can't say it rural rural rural life is I missed everything you just said josh
[216:23.58]Rural life is nice, but you definitely lack access to a lot of stuff.
[216:32.82]That's the Seth MacFarlane dog sound.
[216:41.57]Yeah, that's the Brian.
[216:43.23]Brian from Family Guy.
[216:45.21]Yeah, it is.

[217:12.22]Look, you idiot.
[217:23.94]It always sounds so, I don't know, it sounds so funny.
[217:33.06]My sister used to do that.
[217:34.64]She would go, shut up, you idiot.
[217:39.47]You could tell what sister was mad.
[217:50.69]Is it dirty in here?
[217:51.81]Kind of.
[217:55.69]Are you saying we are the champions?
[217:59.86]No.
[218:02.12]I can't.
[218:02.46]My vocal range is gone.
[218:05.14]It's not high anymore like it used to be.
[218:08.10]I used to have a huge range.
[218:11.16]Now I can just make cash register sounds.
[218:15.85]And low baritone noises.

[222:59.53]I do.
[223:00.82]Hear it back for real.
[223:17.70]I haven't left yet again.
[223:20.26]Lord, I was going to be making those.
[223:21.34]That's not just an idea.
[223:23.06]Alright, now I'll be right back.
[223:26.25]Good song.
[223:26.97]Great.
[223:27.29]That's a good song.
[224:38.80]So,
[226:02.68]Thank you.
[226:33.23]Let me give you a quick little teaser of this one.
[226:38.86]Ooh.
[226:39.88]Imagine going BRB and hearing this.
[226:50.55]It's a little teaser.
[227:12.01]Sounds like winter.
[227:12.69]Could be.
[227:26.84]What about a space BRB?
[227:30.64]Oh, that would be cool, too.
[227:38.94]I mean, I haven't even shown you the one that I think I'm going to use for fall.
[227:43.59]It could be this one.
[227:54.89]Or, you never know.
[228:03.66]Seasonal BRBs are, yeah.
[228:08.46]I love this one.
[228:09.02]This one's awesome.
[228:13.92]You should have a BRB random, like a gotcha.
[228:19.16]There could be rare BRB screens.
[228:21.19]Actually, that's kind of a cool idea.
[228:22.35]Alright, well, I want to listen to the other ones.
[228:34.29]I'm sorry.
[228:34.74]That's what we're doing.
[228:37.55]I want to hear the other ones.
[228:46.57]How about a 1% chance for a jump scare screen?
[228:48.63]Alright, how about this one?
[228:56.42]This one's good too.
[229:16.33]Or winter.
[229:16.81]I can see it fit wintry as well.
[229:43.57]This one fits fall pretty well.
[229:48.71]We got Blordow on retainer, by the way.
[229:51.03]He's been making much more of this stuff.
[230:15.39]We are entering a new highly pogged era of BRBs.
[230:29.06]Yeah, this is spring.
[230:42.72]I love, I love this one.
[230:46.16]This one kind of reminds me, not this one, the one that I played in the very beginning.
[230:49.98]I don't want to cut this off because this is equally as good.
[230:59.49]Are there any new BRB animations planned?
[231:10.53]Yes.
[231:18.92]Okay, so... I have to... They loop, but I have to loop them.
[231:25.09]I'm just kind of playing them.
[231:26.89]This one reminds me of the intro and the outro.
[231:30.29]That same kind of vibe that, like, the drums that go like... You know what I mean?
[231:38.98]I think this one might be my... This one could be my favorite.
[231:55.97]This one has the same vibe as the intro and outro.
[232:14.10]I love it.
[232:14.50]I just want to listen to it like all day.
[232:19.32]Who made these?
[232:19.92]Blordow.
[232:21.20]Go support him.
[232:25.41]Did a hell of a job again.
[232:27.39]And he's making more.
[232:30.49]The entire soundtrack of this whole channel is just Blordow.
[232:35.32]Every time.
[232:35.70]Like I was saying earlier, this shit is... I would love to see a Blordow composed indie game.
[232:50.53]Wouldn't you?
[233:00.48]Oh, yeah.
[233:00.88]Alright, I just want to listen to it again.
[233:04.94]I don't think... Blordow is probably not here.
[233:06.40]Blordow lives in Australia.
[233:09.16]So, not the best time for my stream to be live.
[233:12.46]So, I don't know if they're watching.
[233:16.74]Stalling?
[233:17.30]Yeah, I mean, this is a stall.
[233:18.28]You're right.
[233:22.03]Um... Yeah.
[233:24.87]Yeah.
[233:26.74]He's got a band camp.
[233:27.90]He's got a coffee.
[233:30.92]Absolutely support him.
[233:34.36]By the way, those of you that probably didn't know this, or maybe you did, this is some information for a lot of the newer viewers.
[233:42.37]Blordow's the one that made all the music for the Jerma Rumble live action video.
[233:48.57]That was Blordow.
[233:51.01]That was all him.
[233:58.80]That's another little tidbit.
[234:03.22]By the way, the Bia song is probably the best thing that he made on that.
[234:08.98]Stop!
[234:09.46]I'm trying to talk.
[234:13.58]When is the next live Jerma Rumble?
[234:17.64]I mean, you know what I mean?
[234:21.42]I mean, I don't know.
[234:22.95]I mean, you know what I mean?
[234:24.47]I don't know.
[234:35.35]I don't know.
[234:35.77]You know what I mean?
[234:53.12]Oh, I got it.
[234:53.94]Hold on.
[234:54.42]We've got a customer.
[234:55.14]Not tomorrow.
[234:58.78]What are you talking about?
[235:05.29]Big if true.
[235:09.10]Okay.
[235:11.84]I... Hmm.
[235:14.90]Maybe we can talk about this.
[235:16.26]Maybe we should talk about this.
[235:19.00]It's actually kind of personal.
[235:22.61]It's actually very personal.
[235:27.55]Yeah, why not?
[235:28.67]Why not?
[235:29.83]We're just hanging out.
[235:30.59]We're just chilling.
[235:32.55]So... I want...
[235:37.54]before I am done streaming and kind of doing the whole content creator thing I want to have an absolute blowout show absolutely monumental show uh and one of the things I really want to do
[236:05.90]is like, and like this is not spoilers or anything because there's so much shit written down for this.
[236:12.01]I really want to do like a Jerma Rumble live on Twitch and have it be a fucking monumental magnum opus type show.
[236:23.58]So obviously that's not happening anytime in the near future.
[236:28.94]But just know that that's gonna be... That's gonna be as insane as I can possibly make it.
[236:36.50]Whatever I can do to make it happen.
[236:41.71]Define the near future.
[236:46.47]I don't know if I could even answer that.
[236:47.93]I really don't think so.
[236:53.77]But the plan is...
[236:56.98]to essentially have a an experience that might last more than a day or two maybe longer maybe one event I don't know but I want it to be huge and we're talking like I don't want to okay I don't want to talk about something that's not happening in the very near future
[237:26.22]Are you gonna retire soon?
[237:29.17]No, it really... No.
[237:31.03]It depends on what your definition of soon is, I think.
[237:38.07]Because... My definition of soon is probably different than yours.
[237:46.95]I will tell you right now, there's no plan on that for at least the next couple of years, at least.
[237:53.60]So, don't worry, I'm not like leaving next week or anything.
[237:58.34]There's no plan for me to even start thinking about that for at least another probably few years.
[238:05.08]But, when it does happen, and look, I have to be realistic too, right?
[238:09.44]I mean, I feel like I try to be pretty realistic with everybody here whenever we talk real.
[238:17.83]I know that I can't really do this forever.
[238:21.77]And I said a long time ago that I was going to do it and have as much good of a time as I can and try to do the best job that I can.
[238:29.00]As long as I'm having a good time.
[238:32.18]So I can't really tell you when.
[238:46.59]Quitting in 2025 No, I don't know I can't tell you that I don't want to be and I don't want to be inaccurate with what I mean by this You're not allowed to stop What do you mean you don't know no, I don't I don't want to talk too much about it, but you guys have to remember I
[239:15.61]I'll be 40 pretty soon here.
[239:20.12]I'm having a real talk with my chat room, okay?
[239:24.08]Who do you think you are?
[239:25.38]Who do you think you are?
[239:29.32]Fan for life.
[239:36.11]Sweep that asshole.
[239:40.27]No, but I want to be realistic with you guys too.
[239:44.00]Is it delivery here?
[239:46.33]Oh, level up.
[239:54.51]What do I get?
[240:00.30]40 isn't that... I know 40 is not old.
[240:09.56]Elon Musk.
[240:23.04]And I want to make it clear, too, that if I do at some point end up saying, you know what?
[240:26.69]It's probably time for me to put up the... Like, what's the term?
[240:34.77]Hang up the towel?
[240:36.05]Hang up the gloves?
[240:36.99]Whatever you want to say.
[240:39.74]You guys would know very, very well in advance.
[240:44.94]This is not something that is going to just be like, well, you know what?
[240:47.46]I'm not coming back ever again.
[240:49.30]Bye.
[240:49.70]See you later.
[240:51.60]I would probably announce something like that, kind of like transitioning out of YouTube and Twitch stuff.
[240:58.79]Probably at least a year in advance.
[241:00.27]I would want you guys to know.
[241:01.55]Because I don't want... Here's another thing, too.
[241:03.31]Stop talking!
[241:04.22]Another thing that I don't want to have happen...
[241:12.11]Let's say that, you know, years from now, whenever it is, I decide that's probably it.
[241:17.27]We've had a great time.
[241:18.13]It was really fun.
[241:19.13]And maybe we'll do a few big, like, kind of blow-up shows, right?
[241:23.89]I don't want people to, like, sub to the channel.
[241:26.78]And, like, I just leave.
[241:29.58]I would want it to be really clear.
[241:32.10]Like, hey, everybody, at some point, like, over this next year, this is going to be it.
[241:40.25]Don't be sad.
[241:41.73]It's not happening yet.
[241:44.67]You can't... Don't be sad yet.
[241:46.51]It's not... Don't be sad at all.
[241:49.16]It's not happening.
[241:49.80]It's not happening for a very long time.
[241:59.66]I just... I'm just... It's been something that's not necessarily been on my mind, but... Something that we've really never talked about... Is...
[242:09.74]And I've been doing this for a long time.
[242:13.90]My 10-year content creator, in quotes, anniversary, right?
[242:20.05]I mean, there are TV shows that don't last this long.
[242:22.43]There are things that... It's shocking.
[242:30.62]Don't hit him.
[242:38.12]Again, this is not happening in the near future.
[242:41.22]This is happening at least years from now.
[242:45.12]At least years from now, okay?
[242:47.80]So don't worry.
[242:53.34]I thought I had to deliver.
[242:54.26]Oh, I didn't.
[242:55.30]Oh, shit.
[242:56.72]The delivery.
[242:57.60]The delivery guy.
[242:59.49]He's been here for two days.
[243:01.45]He's been out here for a full two days.
[243:11.38]That was an angry honk.
[243:14.96]I'm sorry.
[243:16.65]I didn't mean to.
[243:17.41]And there's other ventures that I think I want to do.
[243:33.49]You know, maybe I want to start maybe producing some shows.
[243:40.41]Not being necessarily in front of the camera, right?
[243:42.74]But maybe to help with creators making stuff for... Open up a fucking, like, animal sanctuary or something somewhere.
[243:51.04]You know, I don't know.
[243:51.64]There's, like, a new chapter, I think, that I want to do.
[243:53.72]I just don't really know exactly what it is.
[243:56.32]I was worried we'd be stranded.
[244:14.13]What about president?
[244:17.35]You know, I think I could probably do a pretty good job.
[244:19.29]I think so.
[244:22.50]And look at how I'm running this place.
[244:23.60]Okay, we're good.
[244:31.19]I gotta close this.
[244:39.32]We can move on from that conversation.
[244:40.84]It's just I want to do over these next at least couple of years.
[244:48.01]I really kind of want to do some big fun stuff.
[244:52.85]The dollhouse was sort of and like the archaeology stream.
[244:55.46]Those are sort of precursors to what I want to do at least for the next few years.
[245:04.36]If they can happen, then I'm going to try to do them.
[245:06.71]I'm going to try to do for it.
[245:07.93]Do for it, go for it.
[245:09.81]Baseball stream is coming up too.
[245:11.47]That's another one.
[245:12.17]Yeah, I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity for fun.
[245:16.14]Did that person leave immediately because it smells in here?
[245:42.61]You got so mad at Nicktoons baseball, I'm afraid for real baseball.
[245:48.23]That's different, though.
[245:49.11]Okay, we're almost halfway there.
[245:59.50]I want to see what happens at level four.
[246:08.22]You wouldn't be able to hold down a real job.
[246:16.64]Yeah, you're right.
[246:17.98]I'm never going to stop streaming.
[246:19.38]I can't do anything else.
[246:22.90]Actually, I mean... Actually, potentially accurate, though.
[246:28.22]I mean, I'm not a fool to know, you know, things that I think I would like to do.
[246:35.84]I don't know if I disagree with that statement, but... There's other things I want to try.
[246:41.26]Top of the line job there.
[246:49.13]A clown?
[246:49.61]That would actually be kind of fun.
[246:54.19]Ooh, parking lot upgrade.
[246:55.33]That's right.
[247:01.58]Where?
[247:01.88]Where is it?
[247:12.34]I need to clear this.
[247:14.74]I gotta clear this crap.
[247:23.58]It's not like we wouldn't be there to throw money at you if you came back to streaming.
[247:29.94]Nah, but that's not... That's not... I wouldn't want you to do that.
[247:38.54]Where is... Where the hell is my excavator?
[247:51.03]If you got a regular job, you'd be hounded non-stop because of who... Not very many people know who I am.
[247:58.40]Uh... If I went to go work somewhere, it's not like I would... I'm not like a celebrity that opens the door and it's like, Oh my god!
[248:06.41]It's Jerma!
[248:07.29]Oh my god, it's Jerma985!
[248:09.27]No, I... Most people don't know who I am.
[248:23.78]I'm gonna take two or three trips.
[248:40.73]Literally everyone here knows you.
[248:44.13]Yeah, but that this is a... in the grand scheme of the human population.
[248:54.63]Alright, yeah.
[248:57.66]I know we don't get real that often here.
[248:59.28]We just mainly fuck around and stuff, but sometimes it's important to talk about this kind of stuff.
[249:16.01]So many people know you passively.
[249:19.17]Yeah, but they don't know who I am.
[249:21.03]Sure, somebody might have seen the, like, 50,000 upvoted thing on Reddit of me being the AI serial killer image.
[249:28.65]But they just think that that's a real image of a serial killer, right?
[249:31.85]They don't think that's me.
[249:39.80]In fact, if somebody saw me that saw that picture, they would probably have a double-take and go, Holy shit!
[249:46.66]That-oh.
[249:48.29]That guy looks just like the serial killer.
[249:50.29]So, yeah, I would get recognized as the serial killer, not Jerma985.
[249:53.73]Which is kind of interesting.
[250:03.96]Hey, I just... Sorry to bother you.
[250:06.26]Are you the serial killer guy?
[250:07.60]That's me?
[250:09.08]Yep.
[250:10.26]Whoa!
[250:11.56]Dude, how does it feel to know that you look like every serial killer?
[250:15.50]That must be so fucked up.
[250:17.82]Yeah, I mean, it's crazy.
[250:21.58]Wow.
[250:30.10]The garage?
[250:30.60]What do we got?
[250:40.19]Damn, that's crazy.
[250:42.83]The exit conversation as soon as possible.
[250:46.95]Statement.
[250:49.43]You get a bad door.
[250:50.34]We're like, what the fuck?
[251:01.16]Holy shit, man.
[251:03.55]That's crazy.
[251:06.73]You can use all these if you want.
[251:14.09]Oh, we don't need more than one tire.
[251:23.79]Ratio you fell off.
[251:25.13]I don't even know what that means.
[251:28.29]I don't.
[251:33.62]You have two broken tires?
[251:34.90]Shit.
[251:35.22]Alright, well stay here.
[251:35.96]Stay here.
[251:37.24]I gotta order your parts.
[251:50.06]Ban Twitter users?
[252:08.32]I've been watching you for a month and you're already my father?
[252:11.14]What are you talking about?
[252:21.57]I was not prepared for that one.
[252:26.64]I thought you were saying, like, favorite.
[252:28.18]Like, oh, wow, thanks.
[252:29.36]I appreciate that.
[252:30.96]No, I'm apparently your father?
[252:32.50]Alright, I need to... I gotta get deliveries.
[252:40.53]These are expensive today.
[252:41.67]Whatever.
[252:42.95]How much is this?
[252:53.08]Too much money.
[252:54.50]$885.
[252:54.82]Give me a break.
[252:56.64]What's so expensive?
[253:00.32]The anti-scratch?
[253:01.10]I'm just gonna buy the tires.
[253:05.94]They're so expensive.
[253:07.34]Whatever.
[253:17.31]Dad's leaving for cigarettes again?
[253:18.61]Nope.
[253:20.57]Not gonna have to do that for a long time.
[253:29.46]I was worried I'd go over budget.
[253:34.74]Goku?
[253:42.22]Oh, I keep forgetting to restock these stupid shelves.
[253:46.50]All I have is Pringles.
[253:53.59]But they're sour cream.
[253:55.25]Those are the best.
[253:58.55]If you only have sour cream and onion Pringles, that's fine.
[254:13.92]Alright, finally.
[254:19.96]What about pizza Pringles?
[254:21.82]Um, I would probably rather have sour cream and onion.
[254:27.59]Salt and vinegar are based... Mmm, they kind of burn the edges of my mouth.
[254:33.66]I get that kind of... Almost like irritation on the corners of my mouth.
[254:38.80]Mm-mm.
[254:40.12]I think they taste alright.
[254:53.01]What even is this?
[254:56.40]Oh, it's the car parts, right.
[254:58.98]Alright, see you later, man.
[255:03.77]Yep.
[255:03.87]That's how we know the business time for you to leave.
[255:05.91]Take care.
[255:06.33]See you later, man.
[255:06.71]See you next time.
[255:12.37]Uh-oh.
[255:25.83]I bet you they do shit like that.
[255:28.53]Like, yeah, go ahead, take off.
[255:30.43]And it's like, oh, what the fuck, Gary?
[255:34.05]Fucking dick.
[255:47.03]When's the last time you cried?
[255:48.60]I don't.
[255:49.90]Have a nice day.
[256:02.97]There's some real bangers coming in the last 20 minutes or so here, guys.
[256:07.49]There's some real good comments coming in.
[256:10.57]These are awesome.
[256:15.62]It's a fair question?
[256:16.54]How is it a fair question?
[256:23.92]Oh, no, I know what it was.
[256:24.96]It was Ernest scared stupid at the very end when he doesn't have any friends.
[256:30.02]He's sitting there looking sad because he doesn't have any friends that want to hang out with him and he saved the day.
[256:34.91]Yeah, I fucking started crying.
[256:37.01]That was a week ago.
[256:47.67]Hey, don't just...
[256:54.91]Yeah, like, Ernest saves the day.
[256:59.41]And his dog, his dog he thinks is gone.
[257:02.03]Because, well, I don't want to spoil the movie.
[257:04.92]It's a fucking classic.
[257:08.54]Every Ernest movie is a classic.
[257:11.28]By the way, you want to talk about, like, comedy influences on me and this channel?
[257:15.18]Ernest is one of them.
[257:17.55]Has to be.
[257:20.45]Jim Varney.
[257:21.01]The Garage Fucker.
[257:35.52]Ernest made like 15 movies or something.
[257:39.21]He had a bunch of commercials.
[257:40.43]He had a bunch of movies.
[257:42.31]I loved Ernest when I was younger.
[257:43.83]He did Shakespeare.
[258:02.06]Yeah.
[258:05.12]He had such animated... Okay, you know Jim Carrey?
[258:08.38]The way that Jim Carrey kind of moves and talks?
[258:12.40]Jim Varney, in his comedic performances, was like another Jim Carrey type.
[258:19.68]Really animated movements.
[258:21.87]He was super, super funny with his body and his face and stuff.
[258:25.41]It was hilarious.
[258:26.07]He was a great physical comedian.
[258:33.87]When people do that physical kind of exaggerated stuff, you have to be the right kind of person to do it, right?
[258:40.75]Those are huge influences, especially Jim Varney and Jim Carrey.
[258:48.50]Two Jims.
[258:49.40]Jim Carrey, Jim Varney.
[259:02.10]Uh, he was also the original Slinky the dog in Toy Story.
[259:06.56]Didn't know.
[259:19.76]Okay.
[259:19.93]It's dirty in here.
[259:24.95]Almost at the place where I can upgrade
[259:32.82]Original?
[259:33.52]Like, just Toy Story 1.
[259:34.34]None of the sequels.
[259:39.58]Because I believe... Correct me if I'm wrong.
[259:42.58]I believe after Toy Story... I think he died after Toy Story, right?
[259:48.29]That was one of his last roles?
[259:49.99]I remember that was one of his last things he did.
[259:51.49]Oh, I can do the parking lot.
[260:05.11]I like kind of think back at like so Jim henson is another one oh my god it's only jims I'm having kind of a a moment here Jim henson Jim varney Jim carrey anybody else
[260:36.09]Jimmy Neutron?
[260:38.46]Oh, hey.
[260:39.32]Oh, hey, Jimmy.
[260:40.26]Oh, hey, Jimbo.
[260:48.71]Oh, not Jim Gaffigan.
[260:55.97]Um, oh, yeah.
[261:01.22]I think I was probably a little too young to necessarily understand when Jim Henson... Jim Henson... When did Jim Henson die?
[261:08.74]Somewhere in like the early 90s, late 80s?
[261:10.92]I forget what it was.
[261:14.30]But man, I just can't even imagine how much more awesome stuff that he probably would have done.
[261:25.49]And it kind of makes me think too about like our kind of kids content and stuff that's for children nowadays.
[261:32.91]I feel like we need some better stuff for kids.
[261:36.96]I really believe that.
[261:40.36]All the stuff that Jim Henson was doing back in like the Muppets and like stuff like the old Sesame Streets and stuff.
[261:44.70]I feel like there needs to be some more.
[261:47.27]Stuff that kind of taps into kids' imaginations and taps into kids' more creative thinking and stuff.
[261:54.71]Like there's a lot.
[261:55.85]It's an untapped market right now.
[262:02.23]When I was younger, I remember, I feel like a lot of my personality and how I see things were developed from watching stuff like Sesame Street and what's going on?
[262:12.11]Did he just get pulled over?
[262:14.28]Why did he get pulled over?
[262:20.64]Oh my god.
[262:26.98]Oh, the parking lot.
[262:28.23]I gotta let this guy out, okay?
[262:37.34]Alright, you can leave.
[262:44.18]Do not release.
[262:58.06]What's your opinion on almond and oat milk?
[263:00.76]It used to be almond milk candy.
[263:02.02]Now I'm an oat milk enjoyer.
[263:07.75]I actually like oat milk a lot.
[263:15.81]Parking lot, come on.
[263:16.71]Where is it?
[263:23.94]There we go.
[263:24.26]Have you ever tried potato milk?
[263:33.90]No.
[263:35.12]Didn't even know it existed.
[263:43.92]That's why I even asked that man why I asked that what the fuck I'm not even whatever we're just gonna keep we're gonna move on Potato milk, I don't I've never had it I Probably I don't really like rice milk though.
[264:05.26]I Don't like rice milk.
[264:06.20]I don't like soy milk.
[264:07.02]I
[264:08.60]I drank almond milk and put it in my coffee and everything for the longest time.
[264:12.36]Raspy voice Andy.
[264:13.30]Here I am.
[264:14.00]Here I am.
[264:14.46]It's me.
[264:17.67]Oat milk and almond milk are the ones that I find.
[264:19.01]Or taste the best.
[264:24.51]Rice milk is too runny for me.
[264:25.85]It's too thin.
[264:26.21]It's like water.
[264:27.29]Water.
[264:28.69]Rice milk is too watery.
[264:30.89]Oat milk has that thickness.
[264:33.23]And that sort of viscousness to it that I like.
[264:39.83]How about Mountain Dew?
[264:45.81]I don't think I've had a sip of Mountain Dew in like 8 years.
[264:51.75]Good though.
[264:52.73]I would probably drink it if he gave it to me right now.
[265:02.23]17 out of 25.
[265:02.73]Alright, one more car and then I can worry about the... Somebody's already here.
[265:17.81]What about a refreshing Capri Sun?
[265:21.12]Yeah.
[265:21.94]Capri Suns are awesome.
[265:27.22]Although, I like Capri Suns until I see the liquid out of the pouch.
[265:31.84]Something really odd about the way it looks, right?
[265:34.12]It seems odd.
[265:37.05]The mystery of the Capri Sun being inside the pouch is like, I don't care.
[265:41.19]It could literally, the liquid could be like dark brown and I wouldn't even care or know.
[265:47.71]But it's sort of like a, it's like a transparent, like, it's almost like a pink, isn't it?
[265:52.89]Like a light blue.
[265:54.03]It's like water, but it's like pink or blue.
[265:58.11]Yeah, it's slightly pink.
[266:01.83]I think about that.
[266:02.54]I don't want to take it out of the pouch.
[266:21.52]Why would you?
[266:22.04]I don't know.
[266:24.38]Because when you're like 12 years old, you think it's funny to stick the thing and pour it out, like squeeze it out into a cup and then drink it.
[266:33.85]Because I used to stay in the bathroom for like an hour and make magic potions with shampoo, toothpaste, mouthwash.
[266:46.97]I would do this kind of stuff.
[266:54.68]Oh, there goes the combo.
[266:55.86]That's not good.
[266:59.46]Oh, well.
[267:06.64]What did the potions do?
[267:12.87]Alright, I don't know, but...
[267:16.11]But, okay, is this weird?
[267:17.27]This might sound a little weird.
[267:20.21]But it was an excuse to, like, not go to the bathroom.
[267:24.27]I could just sit here and hold my, like, poop.
[267:28.11]And I, it was, like, it was enjoyable for me to, like, sit there and, like, make the potions and not go to, I don't want to go to the bathroom.
[267:35.12]No.
[267:35.28]And I was, like, a little kid.
[267:39.72]I'm making potions right now, mom.
[267:41.82]I'm busy.
[267:42.36]And it's, like, no, get, go to the bathroom.
[267:48.29]and like if you go into goad like number two it was an excuse for me to make potions oh I can do this and nobody's gonna come in I can make magic potions because when you're in the bathroom obviously like the door is closed no one's like coming in
[268:15.80]So it was like I could make potions and like, oh, yeah, I'm in the bathroom.
[268:20.16]Give me the shampoo and give me the mouthwash.
[268:28.14]Great job.
[268:33.23]Alright, only a few more customers.
[268:35.75]You're getting robbed, what?
[268:43.46]What happened?
[268:45.08]Who just threw a stink bomb in here?
[268:46.92]Oh, it's that kid.
[268:47.88]Where is he?
[268:53.94]Is that him?
[269:03.55]I actually kind of like that.
[269:10.43]It's staying.
[269:15.13]A lesson in beating the haters.
[269:18.05]This looks really good.
[269:19.47]I'm going to keep it.
[269:23.31]I think it looks awesome, actually.
[269:25.29]Not changing it back.
[269:28.78]That has to go, though.
[269:34.74]That has to go.
[269:35.70]That one does.
[269:39.94]That'll do it.
[269:48.36]Passive-aggressive Karen.
[269:51.02]Have a nice day.
[269:54.56]I... Alright, there's only two.
[269:55.94]There's two more.
[270:04.72]Here.
[270:09.20]Cute.
[270:18.86]Mr. Elbertson, you have emails!
[270:20.56]I know, I'll get to them.
[270:27.36]I'll get to them, don't worry.
[270:30.85]One more customer and I will go close the doors.
[270:41.23]Sweep your floors or I'm gonna go feral.
[270:43.05]Okay.
[270:53.42]One person can only do so much.
[270:55.06]I'm sorry.
[270:55.72]I can't... Alright, there we go.
[271:08.89]I need to repair cars.
[271:14.53]You can hire people.
[271:15.69]Really?
[271:15.95]I need to close this.
[271:22.93]Fucking garage, Elbertson.
[271:24.59]I'm... Hold on.
[271:26.60]Nobody took anything.
[271:27.28]We're fine.
[271:33.74]Fuel is low.
[271:34.46]Yeah, I'll get a couple deliveries here.
[271:42.21]Make that little shithead work for you.
[271:47.55]I need car parts.
[271:49.50]They're good.
[271:49.92]They're cheap today.
[271:52.42]Four of those.
[271:53.12]Get some of these.
[271:53.78]I need a couple more of these.
[271:56.16]Oh, this is going to be expensive.
[272:05.75]Okay.
[272:06.49]I need a... What smell?
[272:10.87]Well, don't throw, like, a fucking three-day-old, like, Thanksgiving dinner in here.
[272:15.50]Whatever you did.
[272:16.04]I don't know.
[272:30.83]Oh, Thanksgiving dinner.
[272:34.65]Stuffing.
[272:36.71]Cranberry sauce.
[272:37.57]Wait.
[272:39.37]I would like a poll to be made.
[272:41.09]This is going to determine how many people get banned from the channel.
[272:45.52]If you vote for the thing that I say that I... If you vote for one of these that I don't like, timed out for 10 minutes.
[272:53.06]I would like for you to do a poll, whoever is available in the chat.
[272:56.56]Do a poll.
[272:58.02]Or do you prefer the canned cranberry jelly sauce, like in the can, the jelly shit, or fresh cranberry sauce?
[273:10.19]I need to know.
[273:10.61]Pretty much what I asked for.
[273:13.77]Cranberry sauce or the cranberry can?
[273:17.83]I need to know.
[273:28.60]I'm not American.
[273:29.30]Well, this is... Wait, you have to be American to eat cranberries?
[273:34.27]Is that an American thing?
[273:40.31]Who is he talking to?
[273:41.37]Laugh out loud.
[273:43.42]You!
[273:43.68]You!
[273:47.73]This is gonna sound crazy, but you know what I love doing?
[273:49.93]I'm a cranberry fiend.
[273:52.93]I go... Alright, I'm gonna gross out everybody here.
[273:55.03]Are you ready to fucking hate me?
[273:56.63]Everyone's gonna hate my guts after this one.
[273:59.02]Um, I like to buy... The not concentrated, not diluted, 100% cranberry juice.
[274:09.51]Not concentrated.
[274:10.35]This is the real shit.
[274:11.51]And I drink that shit.
[274:14.81]It hurts.
[274:15.13]It hurts.
[274:17.80]It's painful.
[274:19.84]It's like the citric or malic, whatever acid that builds up on the back of your tongue.
[274:24.23]It hurts.
[274:25.65]It's brutal.
[274:27.41]But I like it some.
[274:28.13]I don't know why.
[274:29.37]You can't drink too much of that though.
[274:30.47]You can only have like a little bit of that.
[274:31.81]It's way too acidic.
[274:34.58]What you guys don't know is that when you buy cranberry juice off the shelf.
[274:37.76]Oh, a cranberry juice cocktail.
[274:40.72]When you think of cranberry juice.
[274:41.80]Oh, I'll take a cranberry juice.
[274:43.26]You're drinking like 13% cranberry juice.
[274:46.14]And then like water and sugar.
[274:49.35]You're not drinking the real shit.
[275:01.97]What you guys don't know is... He just called me out.
[275:10.50]I know.
[275:11.66]See, what you guys don't know is that's not real cranberry juice.
[275:15.12]It's cranberry juice cocktail.
[275:16.50]I'm so much smarter than you and I'm better than you and I'm more healthy than you.
[275:23.87]Yeah, yeah.
[275:25.08]Look, I know.
[275:25.88]I'm sorry.
[275:33.86]But, I know it's a little weird.
[275:36.68]I like to drink 100%.
[275:39.41]Not from concentrate.
[275:40.73]Cranberry juice.
[275:42.95]In small amounts.
[275:44.41]Yeah, I don't need too much of that.
[275:45.67]It's too harsh.
[275:52.06]Did we even do a poll?
[275:53.00]Oh, we did.
[275:53.34]Okay.
[275:54.56]What do you got?
[275:58.17]Okay.
[275:59.09]So it turns out that 57% of you, 58% of you are in complete agreeance with all the other idiots that think that fresh cranberry sauce is better than the canned stuff.
[276:12.67]Canned stuff is way better.
[276:24.38]I prefer the canned stuff, I do.
[276:33.17]Time them out!
[276:33.99]Time them out!
[276:34.55]You can't time out, like, what's 60% of?
[276:38.17]How many people are even here?
[276:42.96]We can't time out 8,000 people.
[276:45.76]I don't think we can even do that.
[276:46.66]I don't think it's even possible.
[276:54.73]No, all jokes aside, I do prefer the canned stuff.
[276:57.69]Easier to work with.
[277:00.25]You can grab a knife and kind of just grab a little slab of it and put it right on the turkey and it sticks.
[277:06.37]The sauce gets everywhere.
[277:08.59]It doesn't stay on the turkey.
[277:09.55]It doesn't become part of the bite.
[277:11.20]It becomes a sauce.
[277:16.96]Omega laughing.
[277:26.95]You know what else I really like?
[277:29.01]We're just hanging out.
[277:33.66]You guys ever have red pepper jelly on top of... You take the red pepper jelly out and you pour it over a slab of just Philadelphia cream cheese.
[277:44.94]Just the plain Philadelphia cream cheese.
[277:47.79]Grab some wheat thins or crackers and you just kind of smear down and grab a little bit of the jelly and a little bit of the cream cheese brick.
[277:56.35]If you've not done that before, I assure you, if you do it, you're going to understand.
[278:03.53]It's very good.
[278:07.23]It's unbelievable.
[278:11.61]Red pepper jelly goes great on a lot of stuff.
[278:13.26]I need to eat more jelly.
[278:14.96]I love this stuff.
[278:19.72]You don't eat the whole thing on your own.
[278:23.75]You put it out as like an appetizer.
[278:25.43]You want to kill it at an appetizer?
[278:27.19]I'll tell you.
[278:29.43]Listen to me.
[278:30.34]You bring the red pepper jelly and the Philadelphia cream cheese and you make that.
[278:34.42]It's so easy.
[278:35.10]People are going to think you're a genius.
[278:39.34]And you can use it.
[278:39.86]Be like, ah, it's like my little secret recipe.
[278:41.82]Don't even tell them that you got it from me.
[278:43.85]You take this.
[278:44.39]It's yours.
[278:46.29]You take the credit for this.
[278:51.31]Baked brie and strawberry jam.
[278:53.33]That's leveling up a little bit, I think.
[278:55.35]Because that requires actually baking.
[278:57.37]You don't have to do anything.
[278:59.97]You buy the little brick of Philadelphia plain cream cheese, open it out of its package from the fridge, and just pour the red pepper jelly on top.
[279:09.74]And then take some crackers, some wheat thins, and just put it out on the table.
[279:13.62]You don't have to do anything.
[279:19.57]Well, you also have to make sure that people like red pepper kind of jelly.
[279:24.28]It's not hot, but it kind of is.
[279:30.78]Jerma, a millionaire, eats pepper jelly on cream cheese.
[279:45.79]It's good.
[279:46.47]It doesn't... There's nothing to do with... What are you talking about?
[279:53.87]It does have a bit of a kick.
[279:54.77]Yeah, it does.
[279:55.32]That's not... What do you mean that's not like... You've got mail.
[280:00.68]I know I've got mail.
[280:03.68]I have to repair cars.
[280:10.55]Don't let them shame you.
[280:13.69]No, I know.
[280:22.69]Cub cream cheese is better than brick cream cheese?
[280:26.34]Um, I mean, that's a debate.
[280:28.88]But for this particular purpose, you need the brick.
[280:31.32]Because you have to push a cracker through it.
[280:34.19]And it sits out on the table nice, so you can kind of go through the jelly and into the cream cheese.
[280:44.21]Alright, forget about the... I need to do the garage.
[280:50.71]Is anybody in there?
[280:51.31]Alright, somebody just got in.
[280:52.79]You can wait like four days, it's fine.
[281:01.99]Oh shit, I have no more fuel.
[281:06.67]Oh shit.
[281:09.81]Any kind of jam and cream cheese is good.
[281:11.57]I haven't really had that much experience with it.
[281:15.41]Besides the red pepper one.
[281:20.81]He's spending all of his money on NFTs.
[281:24.81]I'm not.
[281:39.26]Yuck.
[281:39.50]The cootery boards?
[281:41.04]Oh, yeah.
[281:44.67]That fig jam.
[281:45.91]You get fig jam on a charcuterie board.
[281:47.88]What?
[281:48.12]It's not even dirty in here.
[281:49.58]Disgusting.
[281:51.06]What are they talking about?
[281:51.78]Oh, shit.
[281:52.30]Okay, I need to restock.
[282:03.23]I need the ice cream freezer.
[282:13.78]Have a nice day.
[282:16.72]When are you going to make a sus face NFT?
[282:19.10]That's not going to... I'm not doing that.
[282:22.28]Oh, out of fuel completely.
[282:23.36]People are pissed.
[282:24.02]Oh, I'm sorry.
[282:24.70]I need products.
[282:27.56]No, I need gas.
[282:43.76]I'm going.
[283:01.61]This way.
[283:09.99]Fred carefully here, Jerma?
[283:11.24]What do you mean?
[283:18.84]What about NFTs?
[283:23.30]I could give you a small opinion on it.
[283:25.56]Not really a major one.
[283:28.28]But I think that over the next five to ten years, I really hope that if that's something that's going to stick around, that some of the new technologies in the crypto space makes them a lot more efficient.
[283:40.87]If they're actually going to be around, which they might not.
[283:44.35]Because obviously at the current state right now,
[283:47.76]I could use a little bit more efficiency.
[283:50.02]And maybe a little more green.
[284:05.56]Where am I going?
[284:06.45]Where... What's going on?
[284:08.33]Get off me.
[284:10.39]Are these all my tires?
[284:21.42]Alright, is that it?
[284:22.48]What does he need?
[284:23.38]Oh, he needs a second mirror.
[284:24.55]Shit.
[284:28.07]It's an interesting concept, but I wish it wasn't ruining the environment.
[284:32.35]Yeah, well, that's another thing to remember too, is that when people think of like blockchain, right?
[284:39.25]Stuff like Bitcoin, stuff like Ethereum.
[284:42.49]You know, I... There's like proof of work, proof of stake.
[284:47.35]But, hopefully, potentially, over the years, those become way, way more efficient where they don't need to do that much and generate that much electricity.
[284:58.46]I really hope so.
[284:59.08]I think there's a lot of people that are trying to solve that problem at the moment.
[285:05.36]I can't say that I... Oh, fuck, I gave him no gas.
[285:12.97]Zero guess.
[285:19.98]And I also have to be completely honest here, too.
[285:23.64]I don't really even know that much about them.
[285:29.76]I know about, like, cryptographic technology, right?
[285:32.66]And, like, cryptocurrency.
[285:33.88]But NFTs are kind of... I'm kind of a boomer with that shit.
[285:39.00]So, it's hard to even speak about it.
[285:45.33]Oh my god, this is a long line.
[285:47.03]I've been in the line for days.
[286:11.76]But if you want to hear the optimist in me, right, I hope that some of these new technologies, some of these new things people are making can be made and done and used in, you know, kind of proper ways.
[286:22.89]Have a nice day.
[286:33.55]I mean, I, look, I gotta be honest with everybody here.
[286:37.65]I'm not gonna try to, you know, pretend like I don't speak of a certain topic.
[286:42.17]I used to have an Ethereum address that you could donate to on this stream.
[286:48.51]It was there.
[286:50.09]Like, I, it was, I was like, hey, oh, dude, come on, give me some Ethereum.
[286:54.29]This is like 2015 or something.
[286:54.89]2016, right?
[287:00.23]I think as these networks grow, and more and more and more and more people are using them, and we need more and more and more, like, mining farms, right?
[287:12.17]They're trying to come up with solutions to that.
[287:14.59]And I can speak personally that I hope they do.
[287:17.30]I hope they can actually come up with a solution.
[287:26.14]Because I think it's a really interesting technology.
[287:29.58]I do.
[287:31.14]For many different reasons.
[287:33.21]But it has to be done right, right?
[287:36.23]Getting a raid?
[287:37.03]What's going on?
[287:39.45]Oh, good.
[287:39.77]Perfect time to change the subject.
[287:41.43]Hey, big raid.
[287:45.07]Forget about all that shit I was just saying.
[287:50.97]Connor eats pants.
[287:51.68]Thanks for the raid.
[287:52.18]What's up, Connor?
[287:54.16]Welcome, guys.
[288:04.01]How are you?
[288:06.65]Good to see you.
[288:07.15]Thanks for the raid.
[288:07.61]Hope you had a good stream, Connor.
[288:09.91]We're playing Gas Station Simulator.
[288:22.40]Raid song, please.
[288:23.50]There is no raid song.
[288:25.10]It hasn't happened since like 2019.
[288:27.46]Stop.
[288:28.22]There's no meme anymore.
[288:29.64]The meme is gone.
[288:44.14]Yeah, you're talking about a season three.
[288:45.66]No, no, no.
[288:46.00]That's like season five, season six meme.
[288:50.11]We're in like season, no.
[288:51.69]Are we in season 10, season 11?
[288:54.53]That's like a season eight meme.
[289:03.94]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[289:05.10]You guys talking about, like, you guys talking about when, uh, when Dale dropped the chili?
[289:11.26]Um, no, sorry.
[289:11.84]We're like, Jeff and Pam had a baby.
[289:13.68]We're like, that's where we are.
[289:15.11]So, I know, like, you thought that was funny, like, back then, but we're on the new season here.
[289:29.48]I've not watched more than one episode of The Office.
[289:32.88]I've only seen, I think, 20 minutes of one episode.
[289:47.81]Somebody... Oh, there's nothing on the shelves to buy.
[289:49.47]Somebody buy something!
[289:51.39]I need more alcohol.
[289:53.67]Wait.
[289:55.11]Wait.
[290:01.89]What do you need?
[290:13.17]Mmm.
[290:19.75]Everybody keeps busting out their mirrors here.
[290:21.37]What's going on?
[290:21.87]Remember that office crack was actually really funny.
[290:26.73]The way you got the names wrong.
[290:27.99]Thank you for saying that.
[290:33.29]Come on, we're talking comedy here.
[290:37.49]We're talking comedy.
[290:38.29]We're talking comedian.
[290:40.47]Like me, you know?
[290:41.25]I need one more car and that's it.
[290:51.79]I think this is worth buying.
[290:57.21]It's kind of a fun, just busy work game.
[291:01.72]I think it's pretty fun.
[291:06.75]How much is this game?
[291:08.77]Does anyone know how much this is?
[291:18.26]20 bucks?
[291:20.10]Yeah, 20 bucks.
[291:21.02]Yeah, I think so.
[291:32.51]Full trash.
[291:33.25]Oh.
[291:39.88]The smell is horrible.
[291:41.30]Alright, check the email for God's sake.
[291:47.36]Get off my screen.
[291:51.26]Alright.
[292:03.02]How we doing?
[292:06.93]Didn't read them.
[292:07.41]No, I marked everything as read and closed my computer laptop hard and angry.
[292:16.70]One more car going in.
[292:23.94]Whoa, you've been robbed?
[292:24.88]Somebody took... What'd you take?
[292:29.28]Took two gallons of milk?
[292:32.18]Oh, shit.
[292:47.23]I need to repair a car.
[292:53.59]Oh, by the way, to all the raiders, take a look at this.
[293:05.59]Remember that one?
[293:20.56]They're already all gone.
[293:21.58]I don't think all of them are gone.
[293:37.20]Cigarettes are a big seller.
[293:39.04]I almost have to restock them.
[293:41.91]Can you beatbox please?
[293:42.81]Yeah.
[293:57.12]You got a lot of stuff.
[293:58.90]No.
[293:59.64]No.
[294:00.30]No.
[294:01.70]No.
[294:06.28]Where's the beer?
[294:07.08]It's a popular place now.
[294:20.17]There we go.
[294:23.66]Alright, finally.
[294:24.28]What can I do for you?
[294:31.65]Tire.
[294:34.05]Lucky for you, I have one more tire.
[294:35.79]Okay.
[294:52.74]I have to... You had a mirror problem.
[294:56.46]Both mirrors or just one?
[294:57.76]And then scratches.
[295:02.54]Nice.
[295:16.86]Nice.
[295:17.16]Okay.
[295:17.93]Gas station level three.
[295:24.23]These are all, I got to throw these away.
[295:25.51]All these deflated tires.
[295:31.98]Oh, whatever.
[295:32.36]Okay.
[295:32.60]Let's go on to the next step.
[295:40.23]Now, I'm going to close the store after this.
[295:43.89]Because I feel like I'm kind of... I have money.
[295:50.91]This is where you become a combination KFC.

[295:58.56]I like that one.
[296:00.94]Okay, level 700 bucks.
[296:01.74]Let's go.
[296:08.88]So what does that do?
[296:14.77]Ooh, it's like a freezer section.
[296:16.53]Cool.
[296:19.99]Reconstruct the bus stop.
[296:23.46]And this action might have direct and immediate consequences.
[296:26.94]Get ready.
[296:32.20]What?
[296:41.75]Where is that?
[296:42.31]Bus stop?

[306:13.37]Perfect timing.
[306:17.40]Okay, yeah.
[306:17.82]I had to take care of Otto.
[306:24.02]What time is it?
[306:24.42]Wake up for time.
[306:24.92]Is that what I've been streaming for five hours?
[306:28.44]Uh, we'll go for like another hour.
[306:32.91]I'll keep going.
[306:33.47]I'm curious about what this next step is here.
[306:41.26]Do not reset character.
[306:42.74]Oh my goodness, that's so close to resume.
[306:44.70]Uh, over here?
[306:55.10]What?
[306:56.98]What's going on?
[306:58.55]Why is he all over the floor?
[307:05.85]Oh, if you get... Yeah, that makes sense.
[307:07.07]If you get stuck.
[307:13.20]Alright, that gives me... I need more tires.
[307:21.36]I need more mirrors.
[307:22.16]I have five, four... Actually, I think I'm okay for now.
[307:36.38]I just licked my screen and I gotta be honest, this stream tastes terrible.
[307:42.29]No, those are the boogers you've wiped on your screen over the last, like, six months.
[307:58.15]Boogers taste good.
[308:04.07]Ugh!
[308:06.97]I can't.
[308:07.86]Oh, it makes me shake.
[308:09.24]It makes me shiver.
[308:16.26]Alright.
[308:22.56]I have enough to put the ice cream thing in.
[308:33.57]Alright.
[308:35.39]I need to rearrange this whole place.
[308:49.32]Good.
[308:49.68]Clean out all of my stock.
[308:51.20]Thank you so much.
[308:52.24]That's 30 bucks.
[308:56.06]Uh, I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna close the store.
[308:58.04]Maybe serve another... I want, like, at least 500 bucks.
[309:11.11]Don't make a comment.
[309:11.75]I'm doing it right now.
[309:17.79]What?
[309:27.42]Can I get the distance award?
[309:29.50]Oh, I got it.
[309:30.56]Nice.
[309:30.92]Okay.
[309:32.72]That wasn't that far, but still surprising nonetheless.
[309:45.20]Okay, I gotta close.
[309:47.16]We're closed.
[309:47.68]We're closed.
[309:48.40]Oh, there's two customers coming in.
[309:49.72]Okay, no.
[309:50.24]After this.
[310:00.77]Okay.
[310:03.03]Two more cars.
[310:05.17]No, they're not coming for gas.
[310:06.09]Alright, close this door.
[310:14.04]Alright, no new customers.
[310:20.64]It's pretty dirty in here.
[310:21.46]Let's take care of that first.
[310:26.49]Filthy.
[310:26.81]You guys open?
[310:46.74]No.
[310:47.56]We just closed.
[310:48.48]You just missed us.
[310:51.46]Get the graffiti too?
[310:52.34]Yeah, I will.
[310:58.71]Okay.
[311:11.01]You should watch the Sorcery Tribute video.
[311:14.11]Sorcery Tribute video.
[311:18.60]I'm interested.
[311:24.00]Oh, we're closed.
[311:24.76]Right.
[311:24.96]I was going to serve you.
[311:25.78]Oh, well.
[311:25.98]Alright, we have one cigarette left.
[311:35.18]One pack of cigarettes left.
[311:36.46]That's it.
[311:38.62]I need some major restocking here.
[311:44.46]First things first.
[311:47.44]I need an ice cream thing.
[311:56.58]It's not even that much more money to get the big one.
[311:58.73]Alright, I'm gonna move this out of the way for now, because this is gonna be the ice cream station.
[312:08.50]The ice cream and drink station, because this is blue.
[312:10.58]Oh, it's only blue because I haven't painted it.
[312:14.15]I thought this was ice.
[312:15.09]I thought it was icy over here.
[312:39.16]Do you want us to retribute?
[312:41.46]Yeah, we'll... We'll queue that up on Wednesday.
[312:45.08]Because Wednesday we're going to do just a chill stream where I do tier lists.
[312:48.50]God damn it.
[313:01.49]I like that, yeah.
[313:02.35]Okay.
[313:03.27]Is this section for ice cream?
[313:07.57]So you are going to do tier lists.
[313:08.95]I'm thinking about it.
[313:09.57]I do... Maybe just like... I can't paint these.
[313:17.18]Can I paint the ceiling?
[313:18.72]No.
[313:19.70]Oh, god damn it.
[313:20.44]No, I don't want to do this.
[313:22.30]I... Cancel.
[313:23.58]Cancel.
[313:24.06]I want to cancel this.
[313:25.78]Why am I painting the roof?
[313:31.67]Okay.
[313:32.07]Well, now we need to clean this up.
[313:39.82]How about an ass-eating tier list?
[313:41.22]You either do or you don't.
[313:43.24]It's either S or F. And it's one icon.
[313:47.01]You put it there.
[313:47.55]I don't need to have this conversation anymore.
[313:49.45]Okay.
[313:54.69]It is clean in here.
[313:58.64]Let me put that...
[314:05.65]Hence this wall, and then the drinks will be in this back wall here.
[314:08.81]Yeah, this is like the chill zone.
[314:09.81]This is like the cool zone.
[314:17.31]Come on.
[314:19.43]Come on.
[314:23.53]Come on.
[314:23.85]There we go.
[314:25.57]Look at that.
[314:29.78]Yeah.
[314:31.12]Awesome.
[314:32.68]Oh, I love it.
[314:33.26]No, put that back.
[314:34.26]Put that back!
[314:34.78]Stop taking them out!
[314:35.54]How do I put it back?
[314:39.90]No!
[314:46.01]Stop taking them out!
[314:47.27]Oh my god.
[314:47.97]Okay, that was perfect.
[314:57.60]That's fine.
[315:06.74]Can they get to this?
[315:07.60]If it's here?
[315:08.52]I wonder if they can't get to the ice cream.
[315:19.36]Can they get to the ice cream still?
[315:20.60]I think so.
[315:21.12]Maybe not.
[315:25.07]Maybe.
[315:25.31]We'll see.
[315:32.19]What happened to all the stuff?
[315:33.05]Oh my god.
[315:33.47]I almost had a heart attack.
[315:36.99]Let's go back here.
[315:37.65]Who cares about the window?
[315:41.87]Yeah, that's fine.
[315:47.82]Looks good.
[316:02.17]Okay.
[316:03.43]Um...
[316:11.72]Okay.
[316:11.98]Well, it's back behind the wall.
[316:13.98]Somehow.
[316:16.44]I guess.
[316:18.26]Alright.
[316:18.52]What's next?
[316:20.10]Alcohol.
[316:20.78]Snack.
[316:21.12]Sorry.
[316:21.94]Did I get an alcohol delivery?
[316:23.03]I did.
[316:23.29]Didn't I?
[316:25.41]Did I not?
[316:25.89]Maybe I didn't.
[316:37.57]Alcohol.
[316:37.93]Alcohol.
[316:40.74]Couple of these, couple of these, and one of those.
[316:45.62]How much is that?
[316:54.57]Okay, there we go.
[317:04.21]Jerma, how do you deal with the winter lanterns on Nightmare Immensis?
[317:07.93]I turn my volume down all the way.
[317:12.70]And, uh, just go and kill them as fast as I can because the audio is what causes the most problems for you.
[317:18.42]Because it's the most terrifying sound that's ever been put in a video game.
[317:29.25]Fuck, I had alcohol!
[317:31.59]Can I cancel?
[317:32.70]Can I cancel that delivery?
[317:37.94]I needed snacks, not alcohol.
[317:39.46]Shit.
[317:39.88]Whatever.
[317:45.95]He's already here.
[317:47.67]Wave him down.
[317:49.03]I'm canceling.
[317:50.13]I canceled the order.
[317:51.31]I canceled the order in the app.
[317:53.42]I'm sorry.
[317:53.92]I canceled the order in the app.
[317:56.88]No, I know.
[317:57.66]I know.
[317:58.02]I'm sorry.
[318:07.25]Make another alcohol shelf.
[318:08.27]I don't think I can afford to buy one.
[318:16.30]They're like $300.
[318:25.03]Yeah, $170.
[318:27.77]I can open up the store now, though.
[318:28.85]Let me just make sure I clean up.
[318:37.59]I need snacks and smokes.
[318:41.34]That's true.
[318:41.70]I have plenty of alcohol forever now.
[318:55.69]That'll do.
[318:56.13]Okay, goodbye.
[318:57.67]Please leave.
[318:59.53]So I can do the funny thing where I close the gate when your truck is halfway out.
[319:04.27]And we see what happens.
[319:16.30]Well, you made it.
[319:16.78]I think you broke my garage door.
[319:21.44]Oh, shit.
[319:21.98]I think it is broken.
[319:27.48]Alright, we're good.
[319:41.92]Remember, you're not beating the furry allegations.
[319:44.56]I don't know.
[319:47.80]When did I say I was a furry?
[319:55.23]Alright, open this door.
[319:56.37]I have to make some money and then I'm gonna reconstruct the... that thing.
[320:04.08]The bus stop.
[320:04.52]I don't even know what color it is.
[320:13.29]Hopefully this is the right color.
[320:21.00]It is.
[320:21.24]Okay, good.
[320:42.05]I have a lot more to paint.
[320:55.04]Friendly reminder, Jerma once went incognito to a furry convention.
[320:59.89]Well, no, not yet.
[321:18.70]Almost done with this.
[321:19.75]It's going to have to wait.
[321:28.68]Alright.
[321:29.06]We can go back to that.
[321:50.50]And this is not going to be a dollhouse scenario where I'm doing like, oh, look at me, look at me, and doing the walk and stuff in that costume.
[321:59.95]No.
[322:00.09]No, I'm going to be stone-faced.
[322:05.39]I'm not going to make any emotion.
[322:06.37]I'm just going to walk around.
[322:20.29]Hello, welcome.
[322:25.61]A lot of you have this thing in your head where I'm going to be walking around doing the look at me thing all the time and trying to get on people's TikToks and photobomb.
[322:33.58]I'm not going to do any of that.
[322:35.96]I'm going to be the most unassuming person there.
[322:46.73]Good job.
[322:47.77]Like, honestly, anytime you see any footage of somebody in a fursuit, from here on out, from now going forward, it could be me.
[322:56.89]I just want to make that very clear.
[323:03.77]You don't know.
[323:04.17]Customer shit.
[323:21.63]I have to paint this.
[323:22.39]This is really kind of messed up looking.
[323:30.06]We have to find the guy that's 5'2".
[323:33.47]Hold on.
[323:33.81]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[323:34.63]Give me something heavy.
[323:36.25]I don't know why.
[323:36.93]Okay, where is he?
[323:37.39]Where is he?
[323:38.39]Where are you?
[323:38.93]Where is he?
[323:51.17]Get out of here.
[323:52.95]No, stop.
[323:56.76]You little shit.
[323:57.64]Where'd he go?
[323:59.70]Fuck.
[324:05.64]Did he fly away?
[324:06.64]I just saw the shadow on the ground.
[324:08.67]It was like a bird flying.
[324:09.79]Where'd he go?
[324:16.45]Oh, you're stuck, aren't you?
[324:26.14]Oh, there's a lot of people here.
[324:28.60]Oh, God, there's a lot of people.
[324:29.82]It's like 10 people here.
[324:34.10]No, I don't suck, okay?
[324:36.88]I don't suck.
[324:47.53]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[324:48.53]Hello, yes.
[324:49.75]What do you got, ice cream?
[324:52.89]Ooh, these look good.
[324:54.79]Mm-hmm.
[325:11.91]Nice.
[325:14.29]This is quite a haul.
[325:16.41]Oh my god.
[325:17.31]How much shit are you buying?
[325:21.75]That's a lot of stuff.
[325:23.85]It was like six ice creams and like five orange sodas or something.
[325:28.74]Like four beers.
[325:29.74]That was a lot.
[325:31.04]There was like 15 items.
[325:46.62]Ban me if I'm wrong.
[325:47.46]I bet you can't do a perfect wolf howl on stream right now.
[325:54.85]Ban that guy for life.
[325:56.13]Ban that guy for life.
[325:56.95]Ban him for life.
[325:57.49]He doesn't get to come back.
[325:58.91]He does not get to come back.
[326:00.07]Ban that guy permanently.
[326:01.11]He does not get to come back.
[326:08.38]Wait, what was this?
[326:09.52]What was the stipulation?
[326:11.50]If I couldn't do it, then he would get banned?
[326:15.20]I don't even know what I was agreeing to.
[326:26.28]No, no, no, no, no.
[326:27.44]I'm not done.
[326:27.98]I'm not done with your car.
[326:30.34]I pressed the button to have it come down.
[326:32.28]That's it.
[326:32.96]You're getting fucking swept.
[326:35.00]That's it.
[326:35.28]You're getting swept.
[326:38.02]That's it.
[326:38.34]Yeah.
[326:38.48]What are you going to do?
[326:39.56]Run me over?
[326:40.02]You're going to run me over?
[326:41.30]Is that what you're going to do?
[326:44.15]Yeah?
[326:57.66]Get out of here.
[327:01.40]Get out of here.
[327:11.63]Come on.
[327:12.13]I got to get a snap.
[327:16.53]There it is.
[327:23.56]I get to do that once a year.
[327:43.87]I'm gonna go audition for Mario.
[327:45.22]Alright.
[327:49.10]And before the audition, I want to make, like, the audio directors think that, like, I'm really, like, into the role and everything.
[327:54.62]I'm going to, like, warm myself up to be Mario because I'm a huge fan.
[327:59.97]So before I say anything, I get into the audition booth.
[328:02.91]I get into the room.
[328:04.29]And they're all like, okay, so we're waiting.
[328:06.27]They're waiting for me.
[328:07.35]And I just put the headphones on and I start the audition.
[328:09.33]And I just start going.
[328:10.55]Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[328:12.59]Ya-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[328:14.59]Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[328:16.35]Ya-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[328:26.86]And then I do the Mario impression.
[328:29.40]Does that show passion?
[328:34.34]Would I be the annoying guy that's trying to make his audition way better than everybody else's?
[328:38.50]Been trying too hard?
[328:39.28]I'm going in with a plan, man.
[328:49.22]I'm going in with an audition plan.
[328:57.95]Uh.
[329:00.77]I remember I wanted to be an actor.
[329:03.53]I always thought like, man, if I ever went to like an audition, I'd have to like, I gotta stand, I'm gonna stand out.
[329:15.70]I, that's, you put it on the conveyor belt wrong.
[329:17.72]That's not my fault.
[329:18.86]That's, you have to pay.
[329:20.66]You owe me money for what you just broke.
[329:25.03]Hey!
[329:26.13]Hey!
[329:27.19]I'm not done talking to you!
[329:28.23]I could have been Mario!
[329:54.35]That person's liquid.
[329:56.09]That person's liquified.
[329:57.11]There's no way.
[330:16.56]Remember, you're not the horn section.
[330:18.90]You're the whole orchestra?
[330:20.18]What?
[330:27.12]How much do I have to repair the thing?
[330:39.71]Choice.
[330:40.03]I was worried we'd be stranded.
[330:44.85]The lot is quite a lot.
[330:51.85]Alright, it's time to repair.
[330:53.96]Wait, there's one person in the garage.
[331:05.87]No, nobody comes to the garage anymore.
[331:12.02]He'd make a much better Luigi.
[331:13.08]I don't think it'd be a good Mario character at all.
[331:40.95]That just looks like a wet paint version of this.
[331:42.89]Whatever.
[331:43.21]Alright.
[331:55.11]I'm gonna buy an order of snacks and cigarettes.
[331:59.67]And then I'm gonna open it up.
[332:01.87]Snacks.
[332:03.77]These are popular.
[332:04.43]These are popular.
[332:08.02]Alright.
[332:08.88]Order.
[332:09.42]Insufficient warehouse space.
[332:10.54]Get out of here with this bullshit.
[332:16.82]Now I need cigarettes.
[332:19.90]We're gonna go with the Super Blend.
[332:22.02]Premium tobacco and Super Blend.
[332:30.24]That's a lie.
[332:31.14]I have room.
[332:33.28]What is this number even trying to convey to me?
[332:34.86]20 in brackets, 122 out of 200.
[332:36.30]What?
[332:40.73]20.
[332:40.95]122 out of 200.
[332:41.99]There's a delivery on the way.
[332:49.93]Oh.
[333:06.60]Can I upgrade the warehouse?
[333:07.58]I actually might be able to.
[333:16.95]I'm okay on gas.
[333:18.46]Might need some more.
[333:20.14]I might consider a trash removal.
[333:31.89]Because maybe this is like smells.
[333:45.74]Still streaming?
[333:46.32]Yeah, for now.
[333:51.05]Alright, what's wrong with your car?
[333:57.35]Can I do any funny dances?
[333:58.80]Uh, yeah.
[334:00.24]I can do most of the Fortnite dances.
[334:04.04]I practice them a lot.
[334:06.58]At least the default ones that came with the game.
[334:08.96]I haven't played in a pretty long time.
[334:11.48]I have like probably 2,000 or 3,000 hours in Fortnite though, so.
[334:15.27]I do know a little bit about it.
[334:17.89]Stopped playing it a while ago though.
[334:22.22]Um, I can do those.
[334:34.61]I love that game.
[334:35.53]I just kind of wish they would.
[334:36.93]And I want to say out of the building, when you like build and jump around and build, I kind of just lost interest after a while.
[334:44.62]It's a really fun game.
[334:45.34]I think it's really a great game, though.
[334:57.15]You love making people hate you.
[335:01.17]Didn't I say I was gonna stop doing this?
[335:03.07]I did say that, didn't I?
[335:05.33]I made it pretty clear that I was gonna stop doing that.
[335:07.33]Well, well, well, well.
[335:21.88]Clean the scanner?
[335:29.83]I didn't even know I could move my mouse in that direction.
[335:33.77]Alright.
[335:40.16]Get that delivery, order the food, and then we're going to get the bus stop.
[335:47.76]Where's this delivery?
[335:48.76]Hurry up.
[335:50.66]What's going on?
[335:55.23]Something... There's something wrong over here.
[335:57.81]Something's going wrong.
[336:01.29]Oh, this is the guy I threw into the atmosphere.
[336:04.69]He's back.
[336:32.24]Mm-mm-mm.
[336:33.18]Mm-mm-mm.
[336:34.32]Yep, I got it.
[336:34.92]Come on in.
[336:48.97]Mm-hmm.
[336:49.19]Put this out.
[336:52.59]Go ahead and take off so I can close, please.
[336:58.76]Which, as you just know, the devs did not want to fix it.
[337:05.10]What is that?
[337:05.36]Is that like a weight problem?
[337:08.94]It just wasn't necessarily programmed that the cars were going to weigh more.
[337:11.68]So they can be moved very easily.
[337:25.07]Yeah, you can brim the delivery trucks.
[337:26.35]I just don't want to.
[337:26.97]Because I need the deliveries.
[337:33.34]You're amazing.
[337:37.21]You're breathtaking.
[337:45.84]Alright.
[337:51.33]Wow, these are popular.
[337:52.13]Okay, now I need cigarettes and a little bit more ice cream.
[337:57.97]And I'm done.
[337:58.55]And I'm ready.
[338:12.39]I forgot to add the whatever.
[338:14.47]It's a naked guy in the store?
[338:38.27]No, there's not.
[338:49.88]Game lagged.
[338:50.95]Thank you.
[339:01.23]Okay.
[339:07.22]I've not cleaned the bathroom.
[339:08.66]Holy shit, that's accurate.
[339:10.58]Oh god, it's probably horrible in here.
[339:19.98]Are these, like, piss prints?
[339:23.34]Why are they weirdly single file?
[339:49.27]Give me a minute.
[339:51.93]I'm painting over the poo stains.
[339:56.70]That's just gross.
[339:58.62]Come on.
[339:59.54]Grow up, Jeremy.
[340:00.98]Grow up.
[340:08.37]Oh, shit.
[340:12.17]Customer fuel.
[340:13.05]Cash register.
[340:13.79]Fuel is low.
[340:14.84]Customer garage.
[340:28.59]Thank you.
[340:29.15]Alright, next.
[340:31.23]This guy is naked.
[340:32.13]I thought you were lying.
[340:33.65]Holy shit, this guy has no clothes on.
[340:34.83]Thanks.
[340:53.20]Why is the merchandise so dusty?
[340:58.71]Hire staff?
[340:59.45]I can't hire anybody yet.
[341:01.27]I have to level up.
[341:02.19]Thanks.
[341:12.54]Out.
[341:16.84]Room the truck.
[341:19.43]Fine.
[341:22.98]Fine.
[341:34.81]You happy?
[341:39.87]Are you happy?
[341:48.11]And now it's stuck there.
[341:59.39]Almost got it.
[342:03.75]There we go.
[342:04.33]Alright.
[342:04.81]Now, just keep going.
[342:06.61]You're good.
[342:08.16]Keep going.
[342:11.30]Stop turning to the pole.
[342:18.51]Yes!
[342:18.95]Okay.
[342:19.53]He's good.
[342:21.05]He's good to go.
[342:40.76]Alright, time to open up the thing.
[342:49.17]How many people have I killed?
[342:50.13]Zero.
[342:51.81]Warehouse door.
[342:54.37]It's okay.
[342:56.56]Let me just clear out this queue.
[343:01.82]It's a never-ending queue.
[343:12.21]Oh my god, there's too many people.
[343:26.17]Thank you, goodbye.
[343:37.34]Okay, what else did I get?
[343:38.16]Alcohol?
[343:42.85]Alright!
[343:43.09]Where's the truck?
[343:54.84]He made it out.
[343:57.10]He's a little wobbly, but I think he's alright.
[343:58.76]Alright, one tire.
[344:13.99]Two mirrors.
[344:26.70]Warehouse.
[344:27.20]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[344:28.16]There's a lot going on.
[344:40.67]Playing Among Us minigames.
[344:43.82]Yeah, that's fine.
[344:50.73]Thank you.
[344:51.09]Okay, I got a lot of money.
[344:53.31]It's time.
[344:55.75]Yeah, alright, it's time.
[344:56.71]It's time.
[344:58.99]I need fuel.
[344:59.70]Alright, I need a delivery of fuel.
[345:03.74]And then I am constructing that bus stop.
[345:20.91]Alright.
[345:23.07]Let's go.
[345:30.41]One more delivery of ice cream.
[345:36.52]What are you buying?
[345:37.36]What is all this shit?
[345:38.26]I caught that at the last second.
[345:39.42]What?
[345:39.58]How many?
[345:40.00]Did you buy like three?
[345:41.00]How much cigarettes are you buying?
[345:47.95]Imagine being a cashier saying all this shit.
[345:51.35]are you buying oh my god how much how many cigarettes are you buying too many two four pack cigarettes what the hell are you doing making money though
[346:22.82]And now I understand why people that like... Let's say if I was like running a store or like a restaurant or something and it's like you got like 20 people in line.
[346:31.13]And the person's ordering.
[346:32.81]Just like, oh yeah, can I get... I'm sorry.
[346:38.29]It's like you order what you want, get out of the way.
[346:41.22]Oh, but excuse me, can mine come with light oil?
[346:45.60]No, just order it and leave.
[346:48.14]Oh, let me see the menu.
[346:49.38]I'm like, let me get a little closer look here.
[346:51.80]So, Deck, this says it comes with vinegar and oil.
[346:54.00]Can it come with just light oil?
[346:55.88]No, actually, you know what?
[346:56.79]No.
[346:57.43]I can have a peppers on it.
[347:00.21]Yeah, just order it and leave.
[347:13.60]Clean the store.
[347:14.62]Ugh.
[347:21.36]It's always funny when people go to like a fast food restaurant where the menu hasn't changed in like 60 years.
[347:28.49]Now does- does the Whopper come with pickles?
[347:32.71]It's been the same menu for fucking a hundred years.
[347:35.01]What are you talking about?
[347:35.79]I don't- what?
[347:39.14]They have not changed that menu in like- since like 1950.
[347:56.53]What if they don't know, Jerma?
[348:00.10]I know.
[348:00.52]I'm just saying.
[348:03.84]I'm just saying.
[348:08.02]I love that video.
[348:08.56]It's like the funniest video.
[348:15.47]I can do it quick like this.
[348:17.83]Fastest hot dog shooter in the Northwest.
[348:20.75]I don't know.
[348:21.17]Probably the whole world.
[348:22.57]I can do it quick.
[348:34.52]Get the bus stop.
[348:38.98]Why is there... Okay, here it comes.
[348:47.97]Here comes the bus stop.
[348:53.97]A single bus can hold a massive crowd?
[349:02.71]Hire some employees.
[349:03.78]I don't have access to employees.
[349:05.60]Where do you see this?
[349:08.38]I have shelves.
[349:10.36]See, it's grayed out, man.
[349:25.31]Thanks.
[349:27.48]Does it mean a bus comes immediately?
[349:29.34]I don't have any more fuel.
[349:31.48]Ugh.
[349:41.90]You know what's insane about that video?
[349:45.52]That guy... Somebody's like a doctor or a scientist or whatever.
[349:49.97]Maybe you just know.
[349:52.57]He's inhaling the hot dogs into his lungs.
[349:57.41]Am I understanding that correct?
[349:58.79]I don't have any fuel.
[350:05.43]No.
[350:05.89]Are you sure?
[350:12.35]You know how stressful it is?
[350:16.37]Yes, there's pickles on the Whopper.
[350:18.05]They've been there for 50 years.
[350:20.75]Yeah, I can do the fries without salt.
[350:22.91]Of course I can.
[350:23.69]No.
[350:26.61]No, we don't sell another restaurant's food.
[350:30.57]Why would you think we have another restaurant's food?
[350:33.09]Oh, sorry.
[350:33.67]Stole shit out of my...
[350:59.79]He's trying to clean up.

[351:12.30]What is happening?
[351:13.26]Who the fuck are these people?
[351:17.14]Are they taking shit?
[351:19.30]What's going on?
[351:20.30]Are they paying?
[351:21.08]I can't tell if they're paying or not.
[351:32.45]What is wrong with you?
[351:33.83]Is this Santa?
[351:34.57]Alright, alright, alright.
[351:39.37]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[351:47.40]This is going to be a ton of money.
[351:50.79]Okay, I really hate to be this guy, but can't you all just order a huge amount of shit together?
[351:56.49]There's only four items in this entire store.
[351:59.39]Can you just like kind of do it together on the same check?
[352:01.46]You know what I mean?
[352:03.60]Like, I'll just put like 10 of each thing into a basket.
[352:07.04]And look, you can even pay me like 10% under.
[352:09.22]I'll give you like a fucking warehouse price.
[352:11.14]I'll give you a bulk price.
[352:12.94]Just please.
[352:23.10]What are they doing out there?
[352:25.80]I don't have any gas.
[352:32.16]Oh, you guys are fucked.

[352:59.90]Okay, so just to give you a little bit... I'm not going to be doing this in the furry costume.
[353:05.62]Because that's me, right?
[353:06.74]That would be me doing that.
[353:08.56]I'm not going to... That's absolutely not going to happen.
[353:21.11]Hey, man.
[353:21.79]Hey, what did you get?
[353:24.03]Pringles.
[353:25.27]Yeah, me too.

[353:29.75]Oh, yeah, me too.
[353:31.17]Great job.
[353:33.74]Oh, the tongue.
[353:37.00]Hey, man, what did you get?
[353:37.76]You know, you can't Dr. Pepper.
[353:42.80]And I can't Pringles, you know.
[353:46.46]Just simple stuff.

[353:49.24]You got some?
[353:49.80]Yeah, man.
[353:50.60]Oh, Pringles.

[354:26.00]Whatever the hell you're doing.
[354:39.15]Man, take this with you.

[355:00.64]Where am I?
[355:00.98]Oh.
[355:02.20]Imagine the cast... What happened here?
[355:07.07]Answer the phone.
[355:07.81]Oh, no.
[355:15.11]So many cars upside down?
[355:16.31]What happened?
[355:22.08]Alright.
[355:22.78]Answer the phone call from Uncle Ted.
[355:24.20]It's not his name.
[355:26.32]I don't even know why I said that.
[355:28.50]How was the rush hour, nephew?
[355:31.11]Hope you didn't get trampled beneath all the customers coming in from that bus.
[355:36.59]I've heard workers tell me.
[355:38.31]I'm on the phone.
[355:39.47]Just between a passenger bus and I'm on the phone now.
[355:43.80]If you're feeling overworked, how about investing in some help?
[355:48.24]Trust me.
[355:48.70]Oh my God.
[355:49.12]Are you kidding me?
[355:49.72]Thank God.
[355:54.74]I need somebody to work this register.
[356:07.01]Alright, uh, just hold on.
[356:09.22]Employee.
[356:11.60]There's nobody, there's nobody here.
[356:12.90]Employee camper?
[356:19.42]Oh, they have to live, okay.
[356:20.54]They have to live here?
[356:21.74]Okay.
[356:23.80]Now I have an employee camper.
[356:24.96]Fire.
[356:31.83]Shit!
[356:33.37]I didn't need to buy an employee camper?
[356:38.09]I need to register.
[356:41.13]Why do I only have 47 seconds to make a hiring decision?
[356:45.55]This doesn't feel right.
[356:49.17]What?
[356:51.07]Um, okay.
[356:54.21]John's resume makes it clear he is overqualified for the job.
[356:56.57]He finished law school and held a job as an attorney.
[356:59.23]He ceased working in law at a strange time, too early to be a career choice mistake, too late to be disenfranchised with his line of work.
[357:07.35]he does not appear willing to elaborate his website surprisingly does not alright the resume has no hesitation in telling that uh Emily is looking for a temporary job her goal is to become a socialite based off her listed personal information her previous work experience has all been mundane jobs at the service level but number she's worked in the industry for years now you just became a different person what oh right because 23 minutes what happened
[357:35.44]Andrew just finished working three jobs simultaneously.
[357:37.64]His resume notes that he's looking for more profitable work, no matter its difficulty, to have a little more time to himself than... But why do I have 24 minutes now?
[357:46.36]The last page of his resume notes that he is trying to save money for either a potential trip or immigration to Europe.
[357:54.53]Okay.
[357:55.45]He's noted to be an outgoing, easily approachable man.
[357:58.33]With no service experience, you can only use his opinions to judge his effectiveness in working at the gas station.
[358:06.15]Okay.
[358:08.05]Cleaning, six.
[358:10.07]Register, one.
[358:10.88]Repairing, one.
[358:12.36]Fourteen.
[358:17.22]I think, honestly, I'm talking, I think a lawyer would do pretty good behind the register.
[358:21.76]I'm going to go with the lawyer.
[358:30.69]Oh, wait, I can hire you both.
[358:31.65]Alright, you both hired.
[358:34.69]Okay, so how do I?
[358:36.17]Now what do I?
[358:36.69]Alright, well I need help.
[358:38.43]I need some help.
[358:39.15]Where's John?
[358:39.93]I just hired him.
[358:41.56]John?
[358:47.24]Is he in his Hollywood actor trailer?
[358:50.02]Where is he?
[358:54.37]He's resting.
[358:55.43]Oh shit.
[358:57.65]Look at this line.
[359:00.73]Look at this line.
[359:09.30]Come on, hurry up.
[359:12.58]How come I don't get to go to sleep?
[359:19.83]Close the store?
[359:20.69]I mean, this is money coming in.
[359:38.32]Do it after the rush.
[359:41.61]There's a lot of people here.
[359:45.81]Do more cocaine.
[359:53.46]Stop staying open 24-7.
[360:05.46]Why would the scanner be on the other side of the basket?
[360:13.92]That's such a small thing, but I, it's funny.
[360:19.47]That's such a little thing.
[360:20.31]You guys are making me fucking laugh today.
[360:21.71]Okay.
[360:30.43]Where is that employee van thing?
[360:35.05]Whatever it was.
[360:35.91]I saw it get built.
[360:37.09]Where is it?
[360:37.51]There's a mirror?
[360:52.42]Only, holy shit, you're going to pay me $200 plus to just replace your mirror?
[360:55.78]Oh my god, I could probably do this.
[361:01.75]You're not gonna be... Okay.
[361:04.17]Behind the warehouse.
[361:15.42]Is he in here?
[361:15.84]There's a health bar.
[361:21.93]John?
[361:26.21]Uh... I'm gonna... Can you go handle the register?
[361:32.79]Health bar You take the register I will handle the cleaning I
[362:03.75]Alright, if you need help, John's here to assist you if you need it.
[362:11.24]Right there, he's ready.
[362:11.94]Get rid of this trash.
[362:15.62]Clean this place up a little bit.
[362:30.39]You're ringing up stuff more than once.
[362:32.21]You just rang up things like four times, John!
[362:34.67]And by the way, how come you can use the scanner in the basket?
[362:43.87]I didn't even know you could do that.
[362:50.61]That's based, you're gonna get higher profits.
[363:00.21]Uh... What was that?
[363:25.96]I don't want to be like the annoying boss that's like, are you doing it right?
[363:29.66]Are you doing it right?
[363:34.92]We need more ice cream.
[363:37.12]More ice cream, more drinks.
[363:45.32]Let your employee work for eight hours.
[363:49.37]Oh, okay.

[377:53.99]Get out of here.
[378:00.67]Stop it.
[378:06.25]Don't rob too many.
[378:07.03]Your reputation's gonna be on the line.
[378:11.71]Shit, you're kind of right, aren't you?
[378:32.19]Oh, weird.
[378:33.05]The owner of this place is just walking around picking locks.
[378:41.96]Oops.
[378:42.20]Stop!
[379:01.48]Stop moving the car.
[379:10.74]Five bucks.
[379:12.61]That's a lot.
[379:24.77]370.
[379:24.79]I need to buy more car parts.
[379:28.29]Nothing's gone.
[379:30.65]I'm good.
[379:32.27]Hey, I'm going to tell you right now.
[379:34.47]I got a premium payment for you.
[379:39.05]Yeah.
[379:39.95]Keep up the good work.
[379:41.67]In fact, what I need you to do now, I really kind of need, you know, you go ahead and you feel, um, oh, let's go help the cleanup.
[379:53.60]Take over from here, John.
[380:17.52]Okay, we need tires.
[380:18.58]It's so expensive right now.
[380:21.16]God damn it.
[380:21.77]140.
[380:23.61]I think I have a few of these.
[380:26.21]I need tires bad.
[380:33.15]Alright.
[380:46.06]Hey, alright.
[380:46.96]Come here.
[380:49.59]Take that register.
[380:50.19]I'm busy right now?
[380:50.93]Alright.
[380:55.19]I got this.
[381:06.23]Okay.
[381:07.83]Finally, here comes the delivery.
[381:08.83]Come on, you go ahead and keep them distracted.
[381:23.51]16 bucks.
[381:23.99]Thank you.
[381:27.19]This doesn't open.
[381:28.43]This one.
[381:28.73]There's a master lock?
[381:34.64]Shit.
[381:39.84]Shit!
[381:41.16]Oh!
[381:41.44]Oh!
[381:41.68]Oh!
[382:10.22]Yeah, good luck with the snakes.
[382:11.16]11 bucks.
[382:28.49]Nice.
[382:35.35]Oh, delivery.
[382:41.27]Am I stupid?
[382:41.85]Alright, open this door.
[382:50.82]Take the delivery truck.
[383:01.90]This is my order.
[383:07.39]You want me to lockpick my own order?
[383:28.62]Come on, hurry up.
[383:32.85]Ow, I'm sorry.
[383:52.15]Fuck, I have one more chance.
[384:12.50]That's the best one all night.
[384:14.18]For sure.
[384:14.56]I think there's gonna be one better than that one.
[384:29.66]Oh, God.
[384:30.58]Fucking damn it.
[384:31.16]I didn't want to give him 200 bucks.
[384:32.45]Thank God there's a timer.
[384:33.87]I didn't even mean to do that.
[384:43.80]You remember Smash Brothers when you would do the hit the dummy with the baseball bat?
[384:48.83]And for some reason you did it perfect that one time.
[384:52.13]It's 30 to 40% harder than any time you'll ever do ever again.
[384:55.34]That's how I felt about that last one.
[384:57.50]I'm not going to be able to replicate that again.
[385:12.42]Alright, my delivery came in, so let's go stalk that.
[385:19.94]I can't believe, why did you tell me I could steal from people?
[385:22.22]Now this is all I'm doing.
[385:35.73]Some comedian, some per- you've probably heard this a thousand times, so I'm not claiming this is my, like, funny joke or anything.
[385:42.52]But, there really needs to be two horns.
[385:46.44]There needs to be a, like, fuck you horn, like, like this.
[385:50.74]And there has to be a little, like, there should be two different sounds.
[386:03.76]You've said this before?
[386:04.50]Yeah, but I mean it.
[386:08.14]How many times I would like to beep at somebody, but have it be like a, hey, I just, like, I'm just trying to let you know something.
[386:15.12]A regular car horn is just, you're pissed.
[386:17.70]It just sounds so angry.
[386:31.15]Curb your enthusiasm.
[386:33.22]Yeah, probably.
[386:48.65]I'm not even working anymore.
[386:49.91]I'm just like stealing people's cars.
[387:04.18]Come here.
[387:11.66]Oh, shit.
[387:12.16]Can I still do this?
[387:13.98]What do you need?
[387:28.33]Alright, you got a messed up tire.
[387:30.23]I can take care of that.
[387:44.43]This has been a really cozy stream.
[387:47.95]Well, thanks.
[387:48.31]I'm just kind of hanging out.
[387:48.99]I've been having a great time.
[387:51.21]I've been having a really good time.
[387:55.26]I need an anti-scratch.
[388:05.70]You're welcome.
[388:17.11]Shit!
[388:18.89]No, wait.
[388:19.41]There's something wrong with your tire.
[388:22.33]There's something wrong with your tire.
[388:24.23]I forgot.
[388:37.06]She's trying to drive.
[388:37.78]That's why I can't do it.
[388:43.67]Stop trying to drive!
[388:51.96]And whatever.
[388:52.46]Four bucks?
[389:09.92]What do you have?
[389:17.42]Jet.
[389:21.39]Fifteen bucks?
[389:21.95]Alright.
[389:28.32]That'll be fifteen bucks.
[389:29.30]Where's John?
[389:39.31]Um, what's happening here?
[389:40.39]Hold on.
[389:41.59]There's nobody in this car.
[389:51.58]Does that help?
[389:54.38]What's that guy doing?
[389:54.98]Alright, no more stealing.
[390:06.09]I'm not doing that anymore.
[390:07.47]Where's John?
[390:07.81]How you doing, John?
[390:09.83]Nice work.
[390:10.55]Good.
[390:15.11]Cars fueled.
[390:16.13]Shop customers met.
[390:17.52]Received tips and repaired cars.
[390:19.14]This is going to take a long time.
[390:28.07]Hire somebody?
[390:28.95]I need another trailer, right?
[390:30.61]I can't get another trailer.
[390:34.19]Until next level.
[390:37.97]Which is probably going to take a long time.
[390:40.49]It's probably not a bad place to stop, to be honest.
[390:44.33]He's stuck?
[390:46.71]He's not.
[390:51.44]What is he?
[390:54.04]What's going on here?
[390:55.88]Are you not ringing up customers?
[391:07.06]There's people waiting for... How many people have you not serviced?
[391:14.98]Why does he have, like, one of those weird microphones?
[391:17.70]He got, like, one of those evangelical microphones.
[391:21.99]Like, he's on stage doing, like, a stadium full of people.
[391:27.31]A televangelist.
[391:29.67]John?
[391:30.11]John?
[391:35.60]Go take care of the cars.
[391:36.72]I'll take- I'll get this.
[391:37.56]You bought car goods?
[391:57.81]Oh, I only bought two tires, still I can afford.
[392:06.96]What's this thing on the bottom?
[392:08.16]This product scan out of 732?
[392:09.44]That's kind of a weird number.
[392:12.08]Out of 732?
[392:13.20]I kind of need to know what that means.
[392:17.45]Leveling up?
[392:24.27]Alright, how we doing?
[392:35.27]Restock that.
[392:36.77]Restock this.
[392:37.61]Okay, looks good.
[392:40.83]Holy shit.
[392:46.36]That was like a hiccup thing.
[393:01.07]Don't fuck it up.
[393:04.65]Come on, it's right there.
[393:05.53]Nice.
[393:16.60]Where is it?
[393:16.96]Right here?
[393:17.22]There we go.
[393:32.46]Running out of gas.
[393:35.10]No more fuel.
[394:10.22]He's looking for me?
[394:16.72]Where is he?
[394:19.02]Where is that little shit?
[394:21.96]I gotta keep some like plates around or something to throw at him.
[394:24.04]I don't know what to say.
[394:27.48]I'm gonna throw a can of Pringles at him.
[394:28.62]Where is he?
[394:32.51]No, give me those.
[394:33.13]Give me this.
[394:33.43]Give me.
[394:37.49]How do you miss that close?
[394:47.86]Just stop!
[394:48.54]Oh my god, give me the- What?
[395:20.56]What's going on?
[395:35.05]I didn't get it?
[395:37.21]What?!
[395:37.47]How did I not get it?
[395:39.94]What the fuck is that?
[395:41.08]Why did it break?
[395:49.34]By the way, thumbs down upside down is thumbs up.
[395:52.24]So, sorry.
[396:02.35]Blue rocket.
[396:10.82]Alright, I got some cool stuff.
[396:15.73]What did I get?
[396:17.49]Where's John?
[396:18.71]Oh, he's repairing somebody's car.
[396:19.75]Never mind.
[396:30.46]Okay, goodbye.
[396:34.44]Why am I still playing this?
[396:35.84]I don't know.
[396:36.46]I'm having a good time.
[396:49.01]What the drum said in the store?
[396:50.13]I have a lot of decorations.
[396:55.31]Try to glitch a car into the store.
[396:57.15]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[396:58.65]Oh, whatever.
[397:06.11]I'm out of gas.
[397:07.51]Uh, it's going to have to be one of the little cars, I think.
[397:15.85]You're joking, right?
[397:19.84]No, there's no way a car's gonna fit in here.
[397:32.05]No way.
[397:33.25]But what I can do, and I'm willing to do this before the stream is over, is to put, like, at least, I would say, at least 10 to 20 cars in the warehouse with people driving them.
[397:49.91]Go ahead and get that started.
[398:03.50]Come on.
[398:11.37]Oh, no.
[398:12.05]I gotta open this first.
[398:12.89]Shit, don't move.
[398:13.49]Alright, you're not gonna move.
[398:16.67]That's fine.
[398:19.01]Why is the back door open?
[398:20.97]What?
[398:22.47]The back door shouldn't be open.
[398:29.37]No wonder the people have been stealing stuff.
[398:32.99]Alright, let's go.
[398:42.48]This is a different person.
[398:44.74]This is not even the same person.
[398:53.51]Okay, good.
[398:53.91]There's one.
[398:54.29]I'm going to keep you in.
[398:57.30]Yeah, you're definitely stuck.
[399:03.98]Let's try to get at least 10 cars in here if I can.
[399:08.45]Are they going to escape?
[399:13.39]No, because once I get these two in, I'm going to close the door.
[399:15.27]I wonder if they despawn.
[399:17.88]They might.
[399:36.93]Now you beep.
[399:38.31]Of all the times.
[399:43.32]Will you just go in here?
[399:44.78]I feel like I'm... What's that sport with the... You're on the ice and you have to go with the brooms.
[399:53.92]Curling.
[399:56.14]Curling.
[400:02.07]Okay, there we go.
[400:02.91]Now you're in.
[400:03.45]Okay, good luck.
[400:08.38]Two.
[400:08.72]Alright, let's close them in.
[400:15.08]They still in there?
[400:23.13]Why won't this close?
[400:25.25]Let's see if they breed.
[400:33.92]Okay.
[400:42.22]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[400:42.82]Alright.
[400:43.04]Well, we got plenty of people to... Where's John?
[400:46.02]Are you trying to scam me?
[401:02.27]I'm just trying to concentrate.
[401:15.28]Okay, almost there.
[401:22.40]Nice, they didn't despawn.
[401:23.47]Perfect.
[401:33.96]I think I could probably get 10 before this takes too long.
[401:46.31]Now drive this way.
[401:49.09]No, you fool!
[401:57.70]No, you fool!
[401:58.60]Alright, get in.
[402:13.45]Very nice.
[402:20.21]How do you not have a headache?
[402:23.66]Um, I don't know.
[402:24.88]I don't.
[402:28.18]Are they all still waiting here at the register?
[402:34.54]Stop.
[402:49.15]Stop.
[402:56.51]Why is your car so much heavier than everybody else's?
[403:04.24]There you go.
[403:14.75]Stay right there for just a second.
[403:21.75]Oh, shit.
[403:22.27]You're in the way.
[403:31.64]You're in the way, just get out of the way for a second.
[403:44.05]No!
[403:44.40]She's escaping!
[404:01.89]Okay, go on this way.
[404:09.62]Excellent.
[404:11.20]Stop, stop.
[404:11.92]Oh, boy.
[404:12.60]Oh, boy.
[404:13.12]This is becoming ugly.
[404:14.78]It's already ugly and I haven't even started.
[404:16.66]She's doing it.
[404:17.36]She's going to stop driving around.
[404:18.40]Alright, we're secure.
[404:33.55]Hey, hey, hey.
[404:41.93]This is way lighter than all the other ones.
[404:43.43]Holy shit.
[404:43.73]Just look at how this, like, air.
[404:55.76]John?
[404:56.24]John!
[404:59.58]I owe John.
[405:00.16]I owe John 200 bucks.
[405:02.42]He's just there.
[405:03.30]Oh, no, John.
[405:04.60]John, go take care of the register.
[405:06.72]Okay, wait.
[405:07.66]John, where are you going?
[405:10.85]John, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[405:12.41]I need to talk to you for a second.
[405:16.61]There, take 200.
[405:17.49]Take another 200.
[405:17.95]Okay?
[405:18.75]I just gave you $400.
[405:19.63]Go handle the register if you could.
[405:21.69]Thank you, John.
[405:43.63]Your boss is insane.
[405:45.27]Well... Stay like that for a second.
[405:57.18]Car... Like... Yeah, this is too... Okay.
[406:05.37]John is keeping this place afloat.
[406:06.95]Yeah, he is.
[406:18.82]Good.
[406:19.22]No, no.
[406:20.58]No, no, no, no, no.
[406:21.40]Okay.
[406:31.43]There's plenty of room in here.
[406:32.41]This is a horror movie from the antagonist's point of view.
[407:09.94]Just wait.
[407:10.46]Stay right here.
[407:20.36]Getting harder to get into this room.
[407:22.20]What was that sound?
[407:23.63]Oh, okay.
[407:23.89]I have to parkour over all these cars.
[407:35.45]Wow.
[407:36.17]Look at that.
[407:38.99]Didn't even have to do anything.
[407:40.49]We got two.
[407:53.05]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[408:00.33]No, stop driving forward.
[408:21.24]So, me and John have quite an interesting operation here.
[408:24.90]So, they're going through the checkout line and they're driving through the exit over here and I'm pushing their car into the garage.
[408:36.64]You should order a delivery.
[408:38.62]Yeah.
[408:39.68]The plan is if I can get 10 cars in here and order a delivery and then open the damn thing.
[408:43.84]We'll see what happens.
[408:51.22]Come on.
[408:56.04]You're dragging John into this.
[409:00.94]No!
[409:01.78]There we go.
[409:07.99]There we go.
[409:15.23]Are the cars all spawned in here?
[409:16.67]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[409:18.13]Yeah.
[409:26.17]I don't even think I need to even close this.
[409:31.19]No, I don't.
[409:33.16]I do not need to close this.
[409:37.90]Alright, send him.
[409:44.70]Uh-oh.
[409:46.24]Uh-oh.
[409:47.98]Uh-oh!
[409:49.94]Uh-oh!
[409:51.90]Looks like this... No.
[409:56.12]Alright, let's go.
[409:56.66]Come on.
[409:58.46]I need customers.
[410:01.26]Where's John?
[410:05.31]Alright, go on.
[410:30.23]Oh, there you are.
[410:37.81]Rude.
[410:47.16]Almost there.
[410:50.36]No!
[410:51.88]Shit.
[410:52.12]There's so many more.
[410:54.90]There's so many more.
[410:55.72]There's so many...
[411:03.81]They're all leaving at the same time.
[411:04.92]Alright, you go in.
[411:20.48]Okay, now you.
[411:41.29]Somebody's getting out.
[411:41.83]Somebody's getting out.
[411:43.31]Somebody's getting out this side.
[411:44.73]Somebody's trying to get out.
[411:50.38]This is a mess.
[411:51.90]Okay.
[411:54.18]Uh-oh.
[411:57.08]It's going to be really hard to get out.
[411:58.12]I don't think I need to close the doors.
[412:06.15]Her car is wedged in blocking everybody else.
[412:11.95]Ow.
[412:20.21]Unequip the broom.
[412:22.41]The broom pushes it around.
[412:23.29]Nice.
[412:28.97]I'm not quite sure cars bounce like that.
[412:32.91]Have we escaped?
[412:33.55]No, we didn't.
[412:36.05]Ooh.
[412:44.53]Uh-oh.
[412:52.60]You're in?
[412:52.90]Okay, good.
[412:59.50]Not bad.
[413:01.34]We're going to have to make a little bit of room, though.
[413:04.11]So, what I mean by that is some people have to get over on this left side here.
[413:08.65]Got it.
[413:15.75]You're not going anywhere, so it's okay.
[413:17.07]Okay, that looks fine.
[413:26.26]You can't go anywhere.
[413:27.92]One, two, three.
[413:28.42]Alright, I got a lot of cars here.
[413:29.78]Let's get like three more.
[413:30.62]I don't even think about it.
[413:40.93]Perfect.
[413:41.93]Perfectly wedged.
[413:44.34]Oh, perfectly wedged.
[413:46.28]Lovely.
[413:46.61]Alright.
[413:46.85]Well, there are no more customers.
[413:56.99]I think we are at the limit of spawn.
[413:58.47]Yeah, this is the spawn limit.
[414:02.11]It's worse than before.
[414:04.47]It's more of cops.
[414:19.68]They're onto you.
[414:29.50]I am Toga.
[414:34.60]Oh shit, you almost got out.
[414:39.76]Is that the car?
[414:40.34]Wait, what is this car?
[414:41.44]Is this the one I was just using?
[414:54.97]This car is really, uh, like, bouncy.
[414:58.54]See?
[414:59.20]Why is it so bouncy?
[414:59.80]Stop being so bouncy!
[415:04.20]What the hell?
[415:04.74]Remember, what is this accomplishing?
[415:08.18]You need to rethink your life.
[415:11.38]Um... Well, I mean, there's a goal here.
[415:14.28]The goal is to get a bunch of cars in here and then order a delivery truck.
[415:18.54]So, I mean, there's a goal.
[415:29.64]I love how the shape of this car is hard to move around.
[415:39.50]God damn it.
[415:41.18]You had so many opportunities to get away there.
[415:48.67]Oh, this car.
[415:49.79]No.
[415:50.27]We're losing people.
[415:58.12]That's better.
[415:58.82]Yeah, that's fine.
[415:59.84]Do that.
[416:06.66]So close.
[416:11.76]You, get back in there.
[416:16.12]Got it.
[416:20.44]They're going to start to just pop around and I'm not going to be able to stop it.
[416:25.23]Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit.
[416:30.96]No, no, no, no, no.
[416:38.73]Damn broke.
[416:48.68]Nobody, nobody's getting out the other way, right?
[416:55.47]Nope.
[416:58.19]We're good.
[416:58.47]Alright, one more and I'm calling a delivery truck.
[417:05.80]Why is this the longest stream you've done in three years?
[417:08.02]What?
[417:09.68]I played the Lord of the Rings game for like 14 hours.
[417:12.22]What are you talking about?
[417:13.26]That was like two years ago.
[417:18.73]Very invested.
[417:24.40]I'm going to call the delivery truck and then we're going to play the tour go theme for like 10 minutes.
[417:28.62]Until the delivery truck gets in.
[417:47.26]I don't want to be too crazy about this because they all have to go in.
[417:52.20]Perfect.
[417:53.76]Alright, in, in, in.
[417:55.58]Alright, it's time.
[418:01.26]Alright, it's time.
[418:04.78]This is a perfect entrance.
[418:06.52]Time to order the delivery truck.
[418:09.42]Okay, this is ready.
[418:32.17]Alright.
[418:37.83]Save the game.
[418:42.99]Cool.
[418:43.46]Okay.
[418:44.66]Order delivery and I'm going to sit right there.
[418:46.26]I'm going to watch it the whole thing.
[418:49.86]The master will not be pleased.
[418:53.44]Here.
[418:56.28]Take a shitload of money.
[418:57.20]You know what?
[418:57.54]Here.
[418:57.76]Just take it all.
[418:59.26]Take it all.
[419:02.17]And then, you know, just don't, you know, get out of here.
[419:04.11]I don't want you, I don't want you near this.
[419:07.31]Hi, I'm Torago.
[419:15.83]Alright, let's call a, uh, we need a big, we need like a big one.
[419:19.73]So, tires.
[419:20.36]Go.
[419:23.96]Go.
[419:36.06]Do I go from inside or from outside?
[419:38.20]I wonder what's... Inside, maybe?
[419:39.66]What's a better perspective?
[419:40.70]Oh, shit.
[419:48.70]Oh, no, no, no.
[420:19.05]Where is he?
[420:19.81]Where is the delivery truck?
[420:21.52]Oh, here he comes.
[421:00.88]Oh god, here he comes.
[421:32.09]Play the guitar?
[421:35.74]Oh shit, I don't wanna be in the middle of this!
[421:38.18]I don't wanna be in the middle of this!
[421:40.86]Where's the guitar?
[421:44.92]Oh fuck, he's here!
[421:46.06]He's coming, he's coming, he's coming!
[421:48.48]I can't even get to the guitar, man.
[421:50.96]I'm stuck now.
[421:52.56]I'm right in the middle, I'm right in the eye of the storm.
[422:05.23]He's like, I'm not going in there.
[422:06.31]What are you talking about?
[422:15.05]Well, go in there.
[422:15.99]Look.
[422:21.77]I am talking.
[422:36.74]It's gonna be so hard to get him in here.
[422:38.12]It has to be precise.
[422:41.44]Turn the car around.
[422:44.40]Turn the car around.
[422:44.94]Be facing the right direction.
[422:45.80]Go on.
[422:47.80]You need to be facing the right way.
[422:59.56]It's not too tall.
[423:06.60]I think a party bus just came in.
[423:13.70]Oh shit, I gotta get the bus.
[423:15.37]I have to get the party bus in here.
[423:18.77]Come on, get in there.
[423:20.93]Get in there.
[423:21.63]I have to get the party bus in here.
[423:24.85]That's the absolute culmination of this whole thing.
[423:27.65]It's in.
[423:28.84]It's in.
[423:29.20]It's in.
[423:29.38]Oh my god, it's in.
[423:30.78]I'm going to the back door.
[423:31.38]I'm pushing it in.
[423:37.94]Get out of the fucking way.
[423:51.21]Get in there!
[423:52.33]Get in there!
[423:52.89]It's in.
[423:57.49]Oh my god.
[424:11.41]I think this is over.
[424:12.77]How can you work here?
[424:13.87]Give me that party bus right now.
[424:35.09]I'm not having a good time at all.
[424:38.45]You know what?
[424:38.89]Hey, who cares?
[424:39.85]Everything's free today.
[424:42.15]Everything's free today.
[424:42.89]You don't have to pay for anything.
[424:44.89]All free.
[424:46.87]I shouldn't have said anything.
[424:48.38]Come on, come on.
[424:48.88]It's all for free.
[424:55.24]Oh, fuck it.
[424:55.78]Who cares?
[425:01.26]Yeah, you're joining the party.
[425:03.95]Alright.
[425:19.50]This thing is so big.
[425:21.22]It's so huge.
[425:25.00]I have to get it over there.
[425:38.47]Nobody's even driving this stupid thing.
[425:40.75]Here we go.
[425:43.65]Oh, what a perfect shot.
[425:45.54]I think the cop got out.
[426:02.22]I'm closing the door.
[426:02.84]We're having a rave in here.
[426:32.39]Make room.
[426:34.15]Make room for the party boss.
[426:47.30]It's almost in.
[426:53.58]Get this out of the way!
[426:56.50]I thought he said, imagine the fumes.
[427:05.62]It's almost in, just wedge it in.
[427:17.26]Come on, get over there.
[427:22.66]Not bad, this might work.
[427:27.04]Straight in.
[427:30.74]Oh, it's in!
[427:31.84]Get in!
[427:32.94]It's in.
[427:33.90]It's in.
[427:35.46]It's so close.
[427:42.37]It's so close.
[427:44.99]One or two more pushes.
[427:45.83]This should be it.
[427:46.53]Got it.
[427:47.15]Done.
[427:47.79]Game over.
[427:48.87]Lock him in.
[428:11.50]All it takes is a little bit of chaos and this should start moving.
[428:26.35]I can't play Vengabus.
[428:27.53]It's illegal.
[428:28.11]Okay, that car is hiding from me.
[428:34.41]That car is currently hiding.
[428:37.51]Like I can't see you?
[428:44.82]Does that mean all the aliens are gonna come back here?
[428:56.03]I don't think there's anymore cars.
[428:57.35]Oh shit.
[429:06.13]Who are you?
[429:30.23]We gotta go in the back.
[429:32.05]Get a plane in here.
[429:33.17]I can't drive a plane.
[429:34.61]Just go this way.
[429:43.42]Drive around.
[429:46.68]You can do it.
[429:47.02]Don't worry about that.
[430:07.07]I don't think there's much else I can do.
[430:08.51]You need a fuel truck?
[430:13.31]Don't even tell me to do that.
[430:18.02]I'm pretty sure that's the end.
[430:19.00]Close both ends?
[430:24.68]I don't think I can.
[430:25.96]I don't even know how this car got like this.
[430:38.59]I can't go that way.
[430:46.83]I should be able to close both now, right?
[430:51.12]Yeah.
[430:58.76]Mark, you waited till I opened the door.
[431:05.52]Then you think you can get out?
[431:08.79]Very small.
[431:09.35]Why am I speaking with a fake English accent?
[431:12.19]I'm gonna let you go.
[431:18.10]Yes, fucking kidding.
[431:49.26]Can I pick the party bus?
[431:54.37]No.
[431:59.61]Master lock.
[432:05.37]I can't sit down.
[432:06.19]What the fuck?
[432:08.17]I can't sit down and play this.
[432:10.25]There's a truck on it.
[432:16.21]Really?
[432:16.55]Oh, that's annoying.
[432:25.39]Nope.
[432:26.23]It's broken.
