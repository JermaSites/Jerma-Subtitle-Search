[ve:60.16.100]

[00:48.10]Howdy.
[00:51.30]How is everybody doing?
[00:55.43]I hope you're having a great time today.
[00:59.53]I hope.
[01:00.55]I hope that you're having a great time today.
[01:08.00]Howdy, partner.
[01:08.66]Yeah, we're going to be playing some PlayStation 3 tonight.
[01:15.74]And I don't know if you... No, you can't hear this.
[01:17.14]Okay, good.
[01:19.16]PlayStation 3.
[01:20.29]Tokyo Jungle.
[01:22.71]We did a thing.
[01:23.73]Hold on.
[01:24.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:25.61]Wait a minute.
[01:26.33]I gotta press the tweet.com button.
[01:28.39]Come on.
[01:28.87]What am I, stupid?
[01:29.61]There we go.
[01:36.59]Kill the meme stream?
[01:37.77]No.
[01:39.64]Not today.
[01:40.98]Soon, though.
[01:42.48]Fairly soon will we be doing that.
[01:46.98]Now, I gotta make sure.
[01:47.82]I think this is not synced up correctly.
[01:50.52]Hold on.
[01:52.54]The offset is okay.
[01:54.46]Weird.
[01:55.70]I shouldn't be seeing that, but that's okay.
[01:57.46]I'm gonna have to do a test before I get in here.
[02:04.53]Yes, so I did this thing where... You guys remember Sega CD?
[02:08.99]When I bought, like, 20 Sega CD games?
[02:13.03]And we played those over the course of, like, two or three streams?
[02:16.39]Well, uh, Bald Streamer.
[02:19.59]Somebody just called me Bald Streamer.
[02:20.93]No, not yet.
[02:21.97]Not for a little while.
[02:23.83]Not for, like, at least, at least, like, another six months.
[02:27.47]I got, like, another six months of hair.
[02:30.06]I got, like, fuck, I got, like, another ten years of hair.
[02:32.04]Give me a break.
[02:33.78]You've seen my hair.
[02:34.80]My hair is fucking full.
[02:36.24]I've been taking some supplements for it to make sure it stays thick and stays creamy.
[02:40.94]You know what I mean?
[02:45.13]Six months.
[02:46.85]Calm stream.
[02:47.55]No, no, no.
[02:48.45]We're doing Tokyo Jungle.
[02:49.75]Let me just finish my train of thought.
[02:52.54]So, I thought of some old PlayStation 3 games that I've always wanted to play.
[02:57.30]And I've always wanted to record them or make videos on them.
[03:00.07]We're talking like this is like years ago.
[03:01.79]Like two or three years ago.
[03:03.96]And I went on an Amazon tirade.
[03:07.54]And I bought like 35 PlayStation 3 games.
[03:13.15]Some of them that I remember.
[03:14.03]Some of them that I don't remember.
[03:15.83]That may be fun to play on stream.
[03:17.99]So, over the course of the next...
[03:22.24]You know, a couple of weeks.
[03:23.42]I'd say probably over the next two or three weeks.
[03:25.26]We're not just gonna do fucking PlayStation 3 games.
[03:28.52]Because, obviously, Absolver comes out in, like, a week.
[03:32.25]So, I want to play Absolver.
[03:34.71]So, you know, over the next, like, months worth of stream content's gonna be a lot of, like, PlayStation 3 games.
[03:41.38]Uh, some Absolver.
[03:43.26]And I think there's something else coming out that I want to, uh, that I want to play.
[03:47.54]Stalker is still on the table.
[03:48.86]There's still plenty of Stalker.
[03:49.88]There's Metro.
[03:50.88]There's a lot of shit to play.
[03:56.07]Anyways.
[03:57.63]We're going to move on from the intro.
[04:00.08]And we're going to go this way.
[04:01.20]So you can see Tokyo Jungle.
[04:03.12]Now this is important because I'm not sure...
[04:07.14]If this is synced up correctly.
[04:08.40]Because I thought it was.
[04:09.54]It looks like it's not.
[04:10.26]So hold on.
[04:10.58]Give me one second.
[04:13.16]So I'm going to do like a 1, 2, 3.
[04:15.60]And you guys tell me if my voice is in sync.
[04:17.24]Okay?
[04:17.84]So like ready?
[04:19.32]Stats.
[04:20.12]Archives.
[04:20.70]Stats.
[04:21.92]1, 2, 3, 4.
[04:24.08]1, 2, 3, 4.
[04:25.98]Like was that in sync?
[04:29.19]Because for some reason it doesn't look like it's in sync.
[04:36.43]It's good.
[04:39.13]Okay.
[04:39.41]I don't know why it looked like it wasn't.
[04:41.35]Slightly delayed.
[04:42.33]Alright, so when you see the text light up... Ready?
[04:53.10]Okay, so like I was trying... Better?
[05:04.51]Okay, good.
[05:07.27]Don't change it.
[05:11.29]Alright.
[05:13.35]So, I don't know anything about Tokyo Jungle.
[05:16.65]I know zero.
[05:18.17]I just saw the back of the fucking box.
[05:21.42]If you haven't looked at the back of the box, don't even worry about it.
[05:25.88]Because we're about to find out what the fuck even happens in this game.
[05:29.50]Good luck to us.
[05:31.30]Enjoy the fucking jungle, okay?
[05:34.83]So, let's get started.
[05:35.75]I can't do story yet.
[05:36.67]I have to do survival first.
[05:44.08]Here we go.
[05:48.42]I don't know anything about the game.
[05:50.76]Humankind has vanished.
[05:56.72]And in its place, a bunch of fucking animals run the earth.
[06:00.88]A decade later, Tokyo's familiar landscape has become a home to beasts.
[06:05.06]A jungle.
[06:10.17]Pets have turned feral.
[06:15.29]Wild animals have escaped from the zoo.
[06:21.04]Race horses have been freed from servitude.
[06:24.66]Is that a dog with a noose?
[06:25.78]What the fuck?
[06:28.67]Let's take a look at this brave new natural order.
[06:31.21]Okay.
[06:40.25]I like the music so far.
[06:42.01]Is that me?
[06:43.13]Tutorial.
[06:43.65]Do I get to be like the little chow chow?
[06:49.29]This is so dumb.
[06:50.49]Step one, stealth.
[06:51.59]Alright.
[06:55.49]If you hope to survive, do not allow stronger animals to see you.
[07:02.65]That's a stronger animal.
[07:04.90]That's a great dame.
[07:07.37]Okay, he can smell me.
[07:09.39]None of this make tall grass offers a vital cover.
[07:12.17]The grass blocks other animals lines of sight.
[07:21.88]Do I have to attack him?
[07:26.90]Leaving the grass will expose you, which you don't want and you don't want to be seen.
[07:31.22]This is Metal Gear Solid Doggo Edition.
[07:36.51]Reach your destination using the grass to stay hidden.
[07:38.89]This is the tutorial.
[07:39.77]We just have to sneak by all these Great Danes.
[07:44.22]It'll be easy.
[07:46.08]Reach the destination without being spotted by wolves.
[07:51.94]Do I just turn into a marshmallow and I'm automatically stealthed?
[07:55.00]Okay.
[08:00.53]Oh, I've been spotted.
[08:02.43]The wolves caught sight of you.
[08:05.79]fail okay so I just have to wait till they turn their backs like that okay is he gonna turn around or gonna just go right by him there we go okay I get it it's it's whoa whoa what happened what what did I like I like jumped out of the fucking bush
[08:32.85]Alright, right stick apparently, like, jumps.
[08:35.99]Okay, that was dumb.
[08:41.45]Okay, well, whatever.
[08:42.57]Alright, there we go.
[08:46.63]I'm gonna fail.
[08:50.52]I didn't know that if I accidentally pressed right stick I was gonna jump.
[08:56.70]Okay, here we go.
[08:59.86]Okay, cool.
[09:00.90]Got it.
[09:02.41]Right stick is dodge, oh my god.
[09:04.33]Give me a break.
[09:06.33]Step two, hunting.
[09:10.80]Why did this get made?
[09:12.06]I don't know.
[09:12.48]Predators live by catching and eating other animals.
[09:15.32]The hunger gauge shows your current hunger level.
[09:18.58]Unless you eat, the hunger gauge will reach zero and you'll begin to lose life.
[09:22.28]If an animal's life reaches zero, it will die.
[09:26.63]We gotta eat, it's the natural order.
[09:28.71]We have to get the fucking were-rabbit.
[09:31.29]Don't look a rabbit.
[09:31.87]Approach it without being seen, then go in for the kill.
[09:35.01]This is a good tutorial.
[09:35.93]Okay.
[09:42.49]Once in striking distance, an icon will appear to indicate timing.
[09:45.96]Press R1 the moment the bite icon turns red to lunge.
[09:52.02]Holy shit.
[09:54.94]Okay, strip your prey's bones and eat your fill.
[09:59.76]What?
[10:01.10]How do I eat him?
[10:04.40]Oh, he just needs to tap.
[10:07.16]Oh my god.
[10:09.42]Alright, this could be pretty fun.
[10:12.70]Now I get to be another dog.
[10:13.72]I get to be a dachshund now.
[10:15.68]Combat.
[10:16.18]Look at that, I get to be a fucking beagle dachshund.
[10:20.63]In the law of the jungle, animals must compete for food.
[10:24.89]Uh oh, it's me versus a wild hyena.
[10:27.92]The scent of a fresh kill has drawn hyenas.
[10:29.88]You can't deliver a killing bite while the enemy is watching you.
[10:32.90]First you must create an opening.
[10:35.80]Press the square button to claw and expose the hyena to attack.
[10:42.44]Oh, this is fucking crazy.
[10:44.27]Okay.
[10:45.91]Alright, so then what?
[10:48.69]The hyena's guard is down.
[10:49.81]End it with a well-timed bite.
[10:57.42]Why are there hyenas in Tokyo?
[11:02.86]Okay.
[11:05.09]Enemies will attempt to catch you in their own jaws.
[11:07.67]If successful, the attack is fatal.
[11:09.73]But if you evade it, they are exposed to counterattack.
[11:11.85]Is this like a roguelike?
[11:12.85]When the bite icon appears over the beagle, evade, then counter.
[11:16.57]Okay, evade the lunge with the right stick.
[11:20.18]Holy god!
[11:21.38]Okay, I didn't know he was going to be that quick.
[11:25.62]Got it.
[11:26.54]And then I bite with my own bite.
[11:28.54]Grab him by the neck.
[11:29.12]The hyena's left wide open.
[11:29.94]Don't let this chance slip by.
[11:31.42]Bite the hyena back.
[11:33.94]Alright.
[11:34.44]That's fucking cool.
[11:36.74]This game's gonna be fun.
[11:39.70]I'm looking forward to this.
[11:42.56]Even victors are rarely unscathed.
[11:44.14]If the enemy has a pack, the danger rises.
[11:47.43]Do I get to pick what animal I get to be?
[11:50.31]A hyena pack is just beyond use claw and fang to claim their territory for your own.
[11:57.64]Defeat all the hyenas.
[11:59.34]Okay, easy.
[11:59.90]Fight it!
[12:02.54]Don't even know where I am.
[12:03.26]I'm in the fucking grass.
[12:05.49]Watch this.
[12:09.11]Clean kill.
[12:12.47]I love how this is like a shitty beagle taking on all these hyenas.
[12:22.44]Oh, are you gonna be a deer?
[12:24.34]This is just getting a little crazy now.
[12:26.16]Grazers?
[12:29.09]Grazers are herbivores.
[12:30.89]They survive by eating plants.
[12:32.26]They don't have to hunt, but are poor fighters as a result.
[12:38.32]Plants grow in a wide variety of places.
[12:42.42]Yeah.
[12:45.36]The plant icon on your radar shows their position.
[12:49.75]Bunch of like fucked up mushrooms, okay.
[12:52.25]Eat three types of plants without being seen by predators.
[12:54.59]Oh, this sucks.
[12:57.96]Eat three types of plants.
[12:59.28]Can you, like, smell me?
[13:02.94]Can I fight?
[13:03.34]I can't fight him, right?
[13:04.40]Can I?
[13:04.70]No, we're gonna go up this way.
[13:07.10]I need to wait for it to turn.
[13:10.38]How do you eat plants?
[13:15.45]Like that, okay.
[13:17.63]Eat two more plants.
[13:18.51]You got it.
[13:19.09]So there's one over there.
[13:21.05]Oh, easy.
[13:23.68]King of the Jungle.
[13:25.46]Is this a game of open world?
[13:27.40]I think it is.
[13:27.92]Okay, we're good.
[13:31.46]One more plant is all the way over there.
[13:32.90]I think I can just go.
[13:33.74]I'll be cautious, though.
[13:35.94]I don't want to do it again.
[13:39.83]Why are the mushrooms breathing?
[13:41.45]That is weird.
[13:45.31]Alright, this is how you be.
[13:46.73]I'm apparently a rookie.
[13:51.19]Alright.
[13:55.03]12 calories.
[13:58.79]Here comes the pack.
[13:59.37]I gotta run, right?
[14:00.57]Nope.
[14:00.97]The hyena has seen you.
[14:01.81]More dodging.
[14:04.99]A Sika deer stands no chance against a hyena.
[14:13.10]I have to run away.
[14:13.84]There.
[14:14.36]A strand... A stand of tall grass.
[14:16.04]Run for cover in the grass before the hyena catches you.
[14:19.44]Fuck.
[14:20.28]Oh god.
[14:26.22]Alright, I made it.
[14:30.24]If you can enter a stand of tall grass before predators get too close, you can lose them.
[14:35.07]After losing sight of a prey, a predator will try to track them by scent, and you have a Metal Gear Solid fucking counter.
[14:42.99]Your scent will fade and the chance you'll be found decreases.
[14:45.57]So this is gonna be like a scary game.
[14:47.09]When the danger gauge drops to zero, the enemy will give up and move on.
[14:52.10]Okay.
[14:54.51]Seems you've escaped with your life this time.
[14:56.31]Okay.
[14:56.89]I love that there's a stamina bar.
[14:58.19]All right, how do I get to be like the fucking elephant?
[15:07.53]Yeah, maybe like territory and breeding.
[15:09.83]What?
[15:11.41]How much is in this game?
[15:13.81]How many different dogs are there?
[15:15.75]At age 15, an animal's life approaches its end.
[15:18.25]They must mate and reproduce or die out.
[15:20.75]Oh no.
[15:22.79]Oh no.
[15:25.34]Before finding a female and mating, you must secure your own territory.
[15:30.94]Four marking points exist throughout the Shibuya Station area.
[15:37.09]Use your radar to locate them.
[15:39.99]You can also see their precise locations by pressing start to view your map.
[15:44.95]Okay.
[15:46.23]Mark each of these four points to claim Shibuya Station for your own, as like a fucking golden retriever.
[15:55.24]Did I mark it?
[15:57.40]Oh, come on.
[15:57.92]I didn't piss on it.
[15:58.58]I love the jump.
[16:07.15]I gotta claim this place.
[16:08.39]Uh-oh.
[16:11.07]Wait a minute.
[16:11.67]Easy.
[16:13.03]Clean fucking kill.
[16:14.82]Eat him.
[16:21.69]Okay, this is probably going to be kind of fun.
[16:24.69]I like rubbed my nose on it.
[16:25.85]How many more?
[16:26.31]One more?
[16:26.97]I think I missed one.
[16:31.73]Stamina seems to be very, very generous.
[16:34.13]Oh, shit.
[16:39.34]Hyena boss.
[16:40.02]Oh, he's gone instantly.
[16:49.59]Somebody just came in and said, what the fucking shit is this?
[16:55.74]Just wait.
[16:56.48]Just you wait.
[16:58.40]You'll see.
[16:59.90]I have to become king of the Tokyo jungle.
[17:02.90]Am I really playing this?
[17:04.02]Yeah, this game is good.
[17:05.06]You guys don't understand.
[17:07.28]This is a cult classic on PlayStation 3.
[17:10.95]I should know.
[17:11.39]I'm in a fucking cult.
[17:15.03]Oh, shit.
[17:15.51]Hold on.
[17:15.79]Wait a minute.
[17:16.67]Can I still get him?
[17:17.87]No, he's gone.
[17:20.81]One more over here.
[17:28.25]Cult classic.
[17:29.05]It is!
[17:29.57]This is a cult classic!
[17:33.71]We're just doing the tutorial right now.
[17:37.88]You can now use the Shibuya Station nest.
[17:40.92]Now, here we go.
[17:45.38]Shibuya Station lair is now yours to use.
[17:48.06]So drop a couple of eggs in that nest.
[17:55.37]Oh, here we go.
[17:56.85]Females have arrived following the pheromone trail.
[18:00.79]Can I mate with other animals?
[18:02.29]Like, can I have like a fucked up, like, weird dog-giraffe?
[18:05.82]Can I like have sex with a giraffe and have like a dog-giraffe?
[18:08.30]I hope so.
[18:11.34]Use your radar to locate a female and make her your partner.
[18:14.72]Okay.
[18:14.86]Do I have to like, like, what does that mean?
[18:17.91]Do I have to like do anything?
[18:18.95]Do I have to do like a mating dance or something?
[18:24.99]There are three grades of mate.
[18:26.41]Prime, average, and desperate.
[18:29.54]But the best females will only respond to males of a certain caliber.
[18:33.48]Perform hunts to raise your standing as a male.
[18:35.86]Oh, we're gonna have to get something like desperate lady.
[18:39.96]This golden retriever hasn't reached a sufficient rank to interest her.
[18:43.19]Hunt down prey and feed to refine your skills as a male.
[18:46.03]As a fucking golden retriever.
[18:50.91]Okay.
[18:52.35]Hunt to raise your mark.
[18:56.01]Look at how good I am at hunting.
[19:00.11]See?
[19:01.01]Have I impressed you yet?
[19:02.57]I ripped the throat out of a sheep.
[19:06.39]Oh, veteran.
[19:06.93]I get it.
[19:07.27]Okay, so you level up.
[19:09.21]It is like a roguelike, isn't it?
[19:13.11]It is a roguelike.
[19:13.77]Because I have to get to veteran, then there's going to be super veteran, then there's going to be master.
[19:20.71]Okay, is veteran good enough?
[19:24.67]Is it good enough to be a veteran?
[19:25.87]Am I a veteran?
[19:27.26]You need to rank up to mate with that female.
[19:29.12]Oh, come on.
[19:33.02]I gotta, like, sneak... There's, like, chickens and, like, fucking birds?
[19:37.46]What the fuck is this?
[19:40.67]I'm so confused.
[19:41.67]There's so many fucking weird animals here.
[19:49.17]Yeah, watch out for the fucking rooster.
[19:51.58]And, like, a baby chick.
[19:54.11]Drink water, hunger, okay.
[19:55.85]So what am I at right now?
[19:58.46]I'm gonna have to like, sneak.
[20:03.02]Come on, let me get this bird.
[20:04.16]I'm gonna kill the bird.
[20:07.18]Jump from thing to thing.
[20:08.04]Here comes some prey, right here.
[20:11.49]Right here.
[20:15.25]That's like a random cat, all right?
[20:16.69]Like, eat the cat.
[20:18.47]Almost there, and there's a deer behind us.
[20:21.17]Is there a person over there?
[20:22.92]Oh no, that's like a monkey.
[20:25.61]Should I eat the monkey?
[20:27.65]As I'm standing up and looking around, I was like, is that like a guy?
[20:30.39]Alright, let's eat him.
[20:40.95]How could I eat that kitty?
[20:42.25]Well, it's fucking Tokyo Jungle, man.
[20:44.10]You have to... You either die... You either win or you die.
[20:49.64]Seems you've reached a sufficient rank.
[20:51.30]Try approaching the female again.
[20:54.04]Look, you either win or you die in the Game of Thrones, okay?
[20:59.79]I know that show.
[21:00.49]I've watched that show before.
[21:03.26]Now I'm a fucking boss.
[21:05.70]I'm a boss.
[21:06.70]What do you think about that?
[21:07.74]You've met your partner.
[21:10.22]Okay.
[21:11.26]Head for your lair together.
[21:12.66]Do they have- You gotta call it a lair.
[21:15.62]You can't call it, like, house or nest or home.
[21:21.26]It has to be lair.
[21:22.66]Take this woman back to your lair.
[21:25.06]Come on.
[21:27.04]You couldn't have made that a little bit more not fucking creepy?
[21:32.64]Alright, where's our lair?
[21:33.58]I gotta go up, right?
[21:37.21]up there.
[21:37.55]Alright, come with me.
[21:41.47]Come to my lair.
[21:42.25]Alright.
[21:46.33]Join your partner at your lair to mate.
[21:48.55]After mating, you'll have pups and the generations will change.
[21:52.20]Children inherit a portion of the skill their parents cultivated.
[21:55.20]This is very fucking elaborate.
[21:59.52]Mate with your partner in your lair and then change generations.
[22:04.34]Oh, God.
[22:05.00]Alright, come on.
[22:05.60]Come over to my lair.
[22:07.79]It's not going to show this, is it?
[22:12.25]Wait a minute.
[22:19.14]Happy birthday, Golden Retriever 2.
[22:23.86]Mission complete.
[22:31.89]This is cool.
[22:33.53]I'm interested, though.
[22:37.11]Spencer, it didn't show anything!
[22:39.17]Hunting, feeding, fleeing, mating.
[22:40.59]These are the acts that define an animal's life.
[22:43.51]The fight to survive is never easy, but only... There are pterodactyls in this game?
[22:47.52]Are there dinosaurs in this fucking game?
[22:48.92]It's the dawn of another day in the Tokyo jungle.
[22:55.98]Okay.
[22:58.98]There are dinosaurs in this game.
[23:01.30]Now we get the opening cutscene.
[23:07.92]You have earned a trophy.
[23:09.32]Jungle baby.
[23:10.18]Okay.
[23:15.57]Here we go.
[23:16.49]The story tutorial has been added.
[23:19.89]I think we're just going to do this.
[23:21.15]We're just going to do new game.
[23:24.15]Store ranking.
[23:25.81]New game.
[23:27.94]It's a multiplayer.
[23:28.70]Are you shitting me?
[23:30.00]Did this thing simply offline?
[23:31.10]Okay.
[23:32.26]Oh, wow.
[23:33.06]Really?
[23:33.34]Oh.
[23:35.34]Oh.
[23:37.06]There are dinosaurs!
[23:39.90]What?
[23:42.98]There are actually like velociraptors in this game.
[23:45.34]Holy shit, there's a lot of animals.
[23:49.61]I can be an alligator?
[23:51.73]Purchase it on the PlayStation Store?
[23:53.39]Oh, go fuck yourself.
[23:57.39]Oh, wow.
[23:58.03]What's up with this fucking DLC?
[24:02.09]I wanna be the alligator so bad.
[24:05.46]Okay, well, we get the two shit animals.
[24:08.55]Pomeranian and a deer.
[24:10.77]I definitely don't want to play the shitty deer.
[24:12.03]We're going to have to play the Pomeranian.
[24:18.49]Oh, this sucks.
[24:20.23]I want to be like a panda bear.
[24:23.90]Alright, well, let's just be Pomeranian and have a bunch of Pomeranian babies.
[24:29.64]Start.
[24:33.12]Start.
[24:34.50]Here we go.
[24:37.73]Buy the gator.
[24:38.41]You want me to buy the gator?
[24:40.59]Here we are.
[24:43.82]This is it.
[24:49.20]They're just random.
[24:49.82]Are the dogs friendly?
[24:51.31]Are the same breeds friendly?
[25:05.65]No, they're not.
[25:06.67]No, no, they're not friendly.
[25:08.55]It's another dog.
[25:09.61]I thought it was like, we're the same, like, species.
[25:13.87]Nope.
[25:15.62]Nothing is friendly, except, oh, I got zero fucking points.
[25:20.38]I got zero calories, zero years, zero territory, zero generations.
[25:25.02]Hey, at least I got times 1.6.
[25:26.10]Okay, well, let's do it again.
[25:35.51]Jesus Christ.
[25:43.50]Anyway, thank you, Will.
[25:45.54]Thank you, Wile.
[25:47.14]Wile Spencer for the two bucks.
[25:48.33]Buy the alligator, please.
[25:50.67]I might buy the alligator.
[25:51.81]I don't know.
[25:52.11]We'll see.
[25:52.47]It depends on how much I like this game.
[25:55.53]Also, thank you, Purple, for the bits.
[25:57.15]War veteran cult classic streamer demands viewers to join animal mating classic cult.
[26:03.94]Amish Robot, thanks for the three bucks.
[26:06.44]They're doing a Kraygasm.
[26:08.46]Because apparently they like this game.
[26:09.96]It seems pretty interesting.
[26:11.86]Bingus... Bingus!
[26:13.76]Thank you, Bingus, for the dollar.
[26:15.75]Jermo, love your videos and streams.
[26:17.01]Is streaming really your full-time job?
[26:22.21]No, dude, I'm a fucking carpenter!
[26:25.86]No, I'm not a carpenter.
[26:28.06]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the buck.
[26:30.06]Watching animals fuck the game.
[26:31.68]Eh, could be.
[26:33.38]Also, thank you to Spritech and Gary Gray as well.
[26:35.72]Not a late streamer.
[26:36.58]No, I'm not.
[26:40.50]Okay, this time I know.
[26:45.25]They just gave me money to buy the gator.
[26:47.19]Dude, I don't even know if I have to like buy that.
[26:48.97]I haven't turned my PlayStation 3 on in like fucking like two years.
[26:54.15]Okay, I gotta be careful, Ed.
[26:55.13]Chickens are way much, so much lower on the food chain than Pomeranian.
[26:59.10]You know what I mean?
[27:00.30]Obviously.
[27:03.68]So I gotta eat.
[27:05.38]How do I find another Pomeranian?
[27:06.92]Challenge.
[27:08.14]Challenges are triggered by meeting certain conditions.
[27:10.11]Completing a challenge will earn you special rewards.
[27:12.57]Open the menu and have a look at the challenges there.
[27:15.64]Okay.
[27:17.59]It really is like fucking San Andreas.
[27:20.57]Okay, challenge list.
[27:22.45]Step one, defeat two animals and you get 800 SP and your life increases by 10.
[27:28.58]I can see this game getting like fairly addicting.
[27:30.88]Okay.
[27:32.44]Items.
[27:33.60]Help.
[27:34.98]Let's just be easy here.
[27:37.32]Portable bed.
[27:39.92]Items left by humans have a variety of effects.
[27:42.05]You can survive more easily using items appropriately.
[27:44.71]Push the directional button to check items.
[27:49.01]Allow sleeping and mating anywhere.
[27:50.95]You're gonna give me, like, a fucking sleeping bag?
[27:54.45]Okay.
[27:56.17]I'm gonna pee on this.
[28:00.43]Alright, so I got this area.
[28:03.07]I gotta clear this place out and, like, own the street, right?
[28:06.79]But I do have to be careful because I don't want to die.
[28:10.62]Those, those, what is that?
[28:12.08]Is that a bunny?
[28:14.20]What animal is that?
[28:14.84]That's something like a big animal, right?
[28:19.27]It's a rabbit.
[28:19.79]Okay, clean kill.
[28:24.27]Just eat the fuck out of him.
[28:25.29]Okay.
[28:26.81]Another challenge.
[28:27.83]Pet food.
[28:29.31]What the hell is pet food?
[28:31.51]Fills hunger gauge and reduces toxicity.
[28:33.55]Wait, is this like poison in this game?
[28:37.18]There's no other animals over here.
[28:38.16]I'm going to claim this.
[28:41.64]Wait, you're telling me there's a dog inventory?
[28:43.30]Yeah, there's a dog inventory.
[28:47.40]Okay, it's been a year.
[28:49.96]What the hell is this thing?
[28:50.66]Why is there like a graphics card over here?
[28:52.50]Birds.
[28:54.32]Survival points are a way of ranking your survival skills.
[28:56.54]You'll earn points for hunting, ranking up, taking over territory, changing generations, completing challenges, and surviving.
[29:02.54]Push your score to the limit and compete in the rankings.
[29:07.40]Okay.
[29:09.85]Survival points earned are displayed at the upper right.
[29:11.75]Collect survival points in order to climb higher in the ranks.
[29:15.35]Okay, I get you.
[29:17.63]I get you.
[29:18.07]I gotta pick, what is this?
[29:20.81]Can I pick this up?
[29:23.17]What is that?
[29:25.45]Zookeeper Record 1.
[29:27.43]Archives are records left behind by mankind.
[29:29.69]Perhaps collecting them will offer some insight into humanity's sudden disappearance.
[29:33.54]Open the menu in Read More under Archive.
[29:37.75]Can I turn off the awful music?
[29:39.41]Is the music that bad?
[29:42.21]The zoo animals have been restless recently.
[29:43.61]Their fierce predators are particularly on edge.
[29:46.13]Talk to her about tranquilizers.
[29:47.59]Okay.
[29:52.13]This music is pretty bad, actually.
[29:54.84]I'm hungry.
[29:55.30]Uh-oh.
[29:59.14]This is just Dark Souls.
[30:00.24]Yeah, it really... It kind of is just Animal Souls.
[30:02.38]Let's go down here.
[30:07.09]Like, will you shop?
[30:08.37]Oh, there's an animal here.
[30:09.21]I don't know what it is.
[30:09.83]What is it?
[30:11.05]I don't want to die.
[30:11.69]I can't look at what it is.
[30:12.73]Here it comes.
[30:14.50]There's two of them.
[30:17.48]Watch these be like velociraptors.
[30:19.66]I would fucking laugh my ass off.
[30:23.10]What is it?
[30:23.52]I can't tell.
[30:23.98]I don't want to move.
[30:27.16]Oh, thank god.
[30:27.88]No, it's just a pig.
[30:28.98]It's just a pig.
[30:30.79]It's just a pig.
[30:32.91]I thought that was like a fucking wolf.
[30:38.84]Alright, get him.
[30:40.88]Life plus ten.
[30:43.58]Oh, another pig.
[30:44.86]I don't wanna like- he can't get away, right?
[30:46.04]Pigs have so much food, are you shitting me?
[30:49.95]Come here.
[30:52.59]Come here, you fucking pig.
[30:55.43]Come here!
[30:56.93]Don't run into the other animals!
[30:59.87]Oh!
[31:01.43]Alright, got him.
[31:04.59]Alright, I'm- now I'm ranked up.
[31:06.70]I'm a veteran.
[31:08.90]Attack plus five.
[31:12.86]I need to find a mate.
[31:13.78]No, no, no, I'm not a boss yet.
[31:15.14]I can't have a mate right now, right?
[31:20.14]Step three, mark two times.
[31:24.24]EX challenge.
[31:24.97]What is it?
[31:25.27]Oh, this is year three.
[31:26.71]So I gotta like get, I gotta mate before I'm 15, right?
[31:28.93]Okay, I don't need plants.
[31:35.10]Three years plus 480.
[31:36.96]I gotta move then, man.
[31:39.24]Alright, we got like a murder of crows over here, I think.
[31:42.08]I think those are big animals.
[31:45.88]Why did the world change?
[31:47.32]Unclean animals are gathering in Yoyogi Park.
[31:51.84]These look big.
[31:52.80]I don't know what to do.
[31:56.47]Nope, it's just a pig.
[31:57.11]Another pig.
[32:00.43]Oh shit.
[32:01.19]Oh shit.
[32:01.55]Wait a minute.
[32:02.41]Oh, that's just a Yorkie.
[32:03.45]That's a Yorkie.
[32:05.13]Kill him.
[32:07.01]Oh no, I'm attracting other animals.
[32:09.43]Oh shit.
[32:10.01]The golden retrievers have showed up to claim my- What?
[32:15.22]Oh shit.
[32:16.16]Oh shit.
[32:17.38]What is it?
[32:17.92]The turkeys are gonna save me.
[32:18.90]Come save me, turkeys.
[32:20.66]Oh god.
[32:25.47]I'm so hungry.
[32:27.61]Oh no.
[32:28.99]Dog food.
[32:31.62]We're good.
[32:36.13]Alright, get out of here.
[32:38.23]I think I can take him.
[32:40.87]I think I can take him.
[32:41.85]If I dodge, I can take him, right?
[32:43.39]Let's go for it.
[32:51.73]Shit!
[32:58.55]Oh god.
[32:59.07]What did I do?
[33:00.41]What have I done?
[33:04.69]We're okay.
[33:09.87]I hid in a bush for a year.
[33:19.63]What did you do for a year of your life?
[33:21.35]I sat in a bush and I was scared.
[33:28.50]I need to eat this.
[33:29.00]Come on.
[33:30.02]Before the fucking golden retriever gang shows up.
[33:35.44]We're good.
[33:36.48]I guess I thought I was gonna fucking lose that one.
[33:38.82]Why is it so dark?
[33:42.30]It's a turkey.
[33:42.84]It's a chicken.
[33:45.64]He just, like, ran into the fucking wall.
[33:49.99]Why is it so dark?
[33:51.07]Are we in, like, the Dark Ages?
[33:52.11]What's going on here?
[33:57.33]Oh, there's a lot of animals over here.
[33:58.55]I need to mark this territory.
[34:00.47]But what is this animal over here?
[34:03.68]I don't know.
[34:04.68]Hopefully it's not big.
[34:06.38]It's big.
[34:07.49]Oh, shit.
[34:09.19]God damn it.
[34:14.53]Fuck.
[34:15.41]Fuck.
[34:15.97]Oh, no.
[34:16.31]Here come like four of them.
[34:17.85]This is not good.
[34:20.03]This is bad.
[34:20.77]This is real bad.
[34:24.77]Oh, God.
[34:25.15]They're just chasing me up here.
[34:27.15]Oh, my God.
[34:27.57]They actually are.
[34:28.15]They're coming up here.
[34:29.59]No.
[34:31.21]A golden retriever is here to save me.
[34:35.00]Holy shit!
[34:44.78]He on this stuff.
[34:46.78]I'm dead.
[34:50.46]Oh my god, this is like intense.
[34:54.26]Well, I got points, right?
[35:01.34]I thought I could like piss on his thing and...
[35:05.08]Damn it.
[35:05.42]Okay, I'm like kind of addicted to this game.
[35:08.68]I get stuff though.
[35:11.50]Year points, survival points, rank up points.
[35:13.28]It didn't claim any territory, but whatever.
[35:15.89]Challenge points, 1600.
[35:17.85]You must sign in before submitting play data to the... I don't know.
[35:20.99]I don't care about online rankings.
[35:29.83]A new archive has been added.
[35:35.47]Oh, this one, okay.
[35:37.17]Uh, thank you, Muse, for the 10 bucks.
[35:39.15]This is basically... Oh, God.
[35:41.65]I was... Story mode.
[35:46.78]You want me to do story mode?
[35:47.98]You want me to try story mode?
[35:52.82]Thank you, Muse, for the 10 bucks.
[35:54.40]Spritech, thank you for 3 bucks.
[35:58.36]Buy the gator.
[35:59.16]Well, okay, let's just try it.
[36:00.30]Let's see what story mode is.
[36:03.78]I did the tutorial...
[36:06.73]Mankind is vanquished.
[36:07.65]I can't move to the right.
[36:08.61]Do I have to do the tutorial again?
[36:11.29]I already did this, right?
[36:14.25]Story is 18 hours.
[36:15.74]Are you shitting me?
[36:16.48]Yeah, we already did this, though.
[36:19.00]I don't want to do this again.
[36:20.24]Can I, like, skip this shit?
[36:29.44]You have to do this tutorial again.
[36:31.36]Oh, what the fuck?
[36:32.41]Uh, no, no, no.
[36:37.06]18 hours.
[36:37.82]I want to go back to this.
[36:39.00]I was having fun in survival.
[36:43.08]Go back and scroll right.
[36:44.58]I don't think I could.
[36:46.64]Didn't give me an opportunity to.
[36:49.60]This game is made by the same studio that were involved in Bloodborne and Shadow of the Colossus.
[36:54.86]That's interesting.
[36:55.50]Alright, so story.
[36:57.89]It says clear, right?
[36:59.65]Yeah, I can't move left or right, unfortunately.
[37:01.83]Alright, well let's go back to survival.
[37:07.01]Keep going.
[37:07.45]New game.
[37:08.28]Single player.
[37:11.14]So you get more missions by getting archives.
[37:14.02]Okay.
[37:15.18]That's interesting.
[37:17.50]Let's try the deer, right?
[37:20.42]Let's eat some plants.
[37:23.11]You did the base tutorial.
[37:27.31]I have to do the story tutorial, too.
[37:28.93]Okay.
[37:29.57]Well, maybe in a little bit we'll do it.
[37:33.11]There we go.
[37:33.93]Let's make this quick, right?
[37:35.10]I can see plants over here.
[37:38.36]So why would you ever play as the deer?
[37:40.62]What's the point of being like an herbivore?
[37:43.26]Is it just easier to level up?
[37:47.12]Gator.
[37:50.57]No, those are just bunny rabbits.
[37:53.43]Do I even have an attack as the deer?
[37:55.69]Holy shit.
[37:57.01]Okay, I just killed three.
[37:58.15]All right, well, the deer can kill.
[38:00.63]For no reason, because it doesn't do anything for me.
[38:03.63]I just have to level up.
[38:05.58]What the fuck was that?
[38:07.00]That was like a buck.
[38:13.03]No, I don't want to buy the crocodile.
[38:16.05]Isn't that like pay to win?
[38:19.77]Wouldn't that be considered like pay to win?
[38:21.21]Alright, hopefully this is just like a bug or like a pig or something.
[38:26.93]Okay, it's a sleeping rabbit.
[38:28.59]Let's kill it.
[38:34.03]Well, I'm sorry.
[38:34.80]That was kind of uncalled for.
[38:45.82]Why am I fighting a fucking rabbit for no reason?
[38:48.90]I'm just losing health.
[38:52.42]Oh, I only have one attack.
[38:54.80]This is pathetic.
[38:55.54]I can only do one move.
[38:59.48]There's no reason for me to kill these either.
[39:00.70]Why am I even doing that?
[39:05.06]Look, I gotta go get my credit card if I want to buy the alligator.
[39:09.23]I don't have my credit card on file on PlayStation 3.
[39:13.94]That's gonna take like 30 minutes to me to do that.
[39:16.26]It's just a pig.
[39:20.63]Wait, what was that?
[39:22.29]Why is it giving me like a... Oh.
[39:26.61]Now I angered his pig friend.
[39:28.19]Okay, well that doesn't seem like a great idea anymore.
[39:32.85]The pig pack.
[39:34.99]Watch out for the pig pack.
[39:38.28]Okay, let's claim this territory over here.
[39:41.64]How much is it?
[39:42.86]It's probably going to be like... It's probably going to be like 10 bucks.
[39:51.24]I can go across this way.
[39:54.93]That looks pretty dangerous.
[39:55.83]I'm glad I didn't fall off.
[39:57.09]What is that?
[39:57.43]A golden retriever?
[39:59.37]Yep.
[39:59.53]There's a pack of golden retrievers and a pig.
[40:02.11]Pigs are running from the golden retrievers.
[40:05.67]Can I sneak up their MP on their stuff?
[40:08.83]Oh my god, it's an alligator!
[40:10.83]Oh my god!
[40:11.49]Oh my god!
[40:23.18]Why is there an alligator and a golden retriever hanging out in the same spot?
[40:29.60]Somebody else bought the alligator and killed me.
[40:39.80]It's a sign.
[40:41.24]Buy the alligator.
[40:42.96]No.
[40:43.97]No.
[40:49.57]They were running from the alligator, not the dog.
[40:53.75]That's my penance.
[40:54.58]I have to buy the alligator.
[40:57.66]God damn it.
[40:58.54]Why would I... Why is there a super Pomeranian?
[41:01.64]There's a kangaroo.
[41:05.07]Ugh.
[41:07.62]Let's not just jump right to the pay-to-win animals, alright?
[41:10.37]I need to at least try to survive and mate as a Pomeranian.
[41:16.19]We're not gonna buy the pay-to-win fucking dinosaurs yet.
[41:22.22]It's only been like 30 minutes.
[41:27.06]Okay, let's not fuck around here.
[41:29.96]Let's try to survive 10 years.
[41:33.30]I'm gonna go pick up these weird electronic devices.
[41:39.62]We're gonna do with Pomeranian this thing up big time How many areas do you have to mark before you get And you like claim the zone and where is there I want to find another Pomeranian Alright couple of chickens.
[41:57.19]Let's be easy This is easy killings here free food
[42:09.46]I need to level up.
[42:11.26]So I can stand a chance against the alligator.
[42:14.01]Chicken?
[42:14.63]Is there a chicken over here, too?
[42:15.71]Or is that something else?
[42:16.89]Alright.
[42:19.45]Okay, those are rabbits.
[42:20.19]This is easy.
[42:20.89]Easy level up right here.
[42:22.29]Oh, goddammit.
[42:22.79]I fucking missed.
[42:23.73]And they're all running away.
[42:24.53]It's alright.
[42:31.14]Dog versus alligator.
[42:32.30]If I level up enough, I'll be able to beat it.
[42:33.70]It'll be easy.
[42:35.32]Catch this guy on the way over.
[42:36.52]Come on, give me that.
[42:37.32]Bang.
[42:37.48]Got it.
[42:39.66]Life plus 10.
[42:44.98]Realistically, this would just all be, like, nuts.
[42:46.96]Yes, this is true.
[42:48.42]It would be.
[42:50.78]I'm now ranked veteran.
[42:51.62]There's another rabbit over here.
[42:52.52]Let me get rid of him.
[42:55.92]Come on.
[42:57.30]I gotta get closer.
[42:59.02]Ah, he might get away.
[43:00.68]Rabbits are faster than Pomeranians.
[43:03.40]Yeah, that fucking guy's faster than me.
[43:05.00]Whatever.
[43:05.32]It's alright.
[43:07.06]Do I have any... No items.
[43:08.14]This is a roguelike...
[43:12.10]Being a proper predator, yes.
[43:15.84]Where do the Pomeranians hang out?
[43:18.16]Can I look at, like, the map?
[43:19.86]Is there, like, a where the Pomeranians like to go?
[43:25.14]No, there's a lot of places to go, though.
[43:26.56]There's a lot of areas to explore.
[43:27.86]This game is a lot more robust than I thought it was going to be.
[43:34.94]Okay, this is where I got in trouble before.
[43:39.68]What is over here?
[43:42.73]They look big.
[43:43.95]Those shadows are fucking huge.
[43:45.77]Nope.
[43:46.11]Just chickens.
[43:47.01]Good.
[43:47.35]Perfect.
[43:51.84]Don't give away my spot, please.
[43:54.08]Now I'm a veteran.
[43:57.52]Perfect.
[43:58.04]Attack plus five.
[43:59.12]What is over here?
[44:01.52]I think that's big.
[44:02.95]Nope.
[44:03.53]It's just a sheep.
[44:04.29]Perfect.
[44:05.51]Sheep have so much meat on them, too.
[44:09.79]Come on.
[44:10.03]Give me the icon.
[44:11.49]Come on.
[44:14.85]Whatever.
[44:18.11]Look at how much meat these guys got on him.
[44:19.45]This is perfect.
[44:22.99]Go back and get the last flag.
[44:26.42]Which one?
[44:27.00]I'm in like a new zone right now.
[44:32.02]Are you talking about up here?
[44:41.74]Okay, let's see.
[44:42.82]You need the full terror.
[44:43.84]Alright, I get you.
[44:46.40]Pretty good porn music.
[44:49.32]This music is really good.
[44:50.14]This is really good, like, porno music.
[44:51.64]That's for sure.
[44:56.97]And eat this guy.
[44:58.07]Come on, give me the jaws.
[45:00.77]Come on, don't let him.
[45:02.47]Don't let him.
[45:07.33]Full hunger.
[45:07.83]This is going to be the first game I get to block.
[45:14.21]So all these flags need to be capped in a zone to capture the zone.
[45:17.69]I get you.
[45:21.10]Dangerous or not dangerous?
[45:24.92]That's a golden retriever.
[45:25.70]I gotta be careful.
[45:26.24]No, don't fuck around with a golden retriever right now.
[45:29.14]Stay in the shadows.
[45:29.80]There's one right here.
[45:36.01]I can't tell what direction he's facing though.
[45:40.65]This is going to be tough.
[45:42.13]How am I going to sneak over here and pee on this stuff?
[45:45.15]Oh, I think I got it.
[45:46.35]The rabbits are sleeping over there.
[45:47.25]Mark it.
[45:48.01]Claim it.
[45:50.03]Got it.
[45:50.99]Territory occupied.

[46:18.82]Is she gonna help me fight, too?
[46:20.96]Can I go with, like, a pack of Pomeranians to fight the Golden Retrievers?
[46:26.26]Alright, hurry up before I lose my appetite.
[46:29.16]No, I don't mean that, like, sexual appetite.
[46:31.78]I mean, like, before we starve to death.
[46:34.28]Shit!
[46:35.90]It's okay.
[46:36.14]It's really dark.

[47:56.41]Happy birthday, Pomeranian 2.
[47:58.79]Form a pack.
[47:59.59]In the event of your death, control will switch to a packmate.
[48:02.91]You can also order packmates to fight by holding the triangle button.
[48:08.81]Oh, and now I'm a baby.
[48:10.01]Okay.
[48:12.94]So we have to go, like, hunting as babies?
[48:15.78]This is not gonna go well.
[48:20.32]Okay.
[48:22.68]So I have to be this guy now.
[48:24.34]And we have to go as a pack of babies.
[48:30.00]Why do I foresee extreme danger here?
[48:32.18]Alright, what is this?
[48:32.89]Is this a bunny rabbit?
[48:33.75]Are we gonna feed on the bunny?
[48:38.65]Running really fast, whatever it is.
[48:42.42]We're gonna starve to death.
[48:43.52]Why would you make your children go off and die?
[48:45.10]I was just playing as the adult.

[50:19.46]That's the goal.
[50:20.32]The goal is to go kill that alligator with our babies.
[50:24.85]What is this?
[50:28.13]Everybody just like jumps over the candlestick.
[50:31.49]We need to eat something now.

[51:14.87]Somebody's guarding this fucking data disk.
[51:17.59]Alright, boys.
[51:19.03]You guys wanna eat?
[51:20.07]It's time to eat.
[51:21.35]Go after the fucking Yorkie!

[51:28.88]Can't fight his fucking neck.
[51:30.28]How dare you?
[51:31.14]We're the only cool small dog in this fucking universe.
[51:36.64]Alright, we're gonna get this data disk.
[51:42.92]Alright, we got another one of those.
[51:44.78]So you unlock missions by collecting those.
[51:47.42]That's what I understand, right?
[51:48.36]I love how they follow you.
[51:50.02]They do the same jump.
[51:50.87]It's so cute.
[51:52.97]Do we all pee on it or just me?
[51:57.61]Defense up.
[52:00.35]Any other places that I need to mark here?
[52:01.71]Alright, I got this one.
[52:04.79]What is down here?
[52:05.37]This is like an empty area.
[52:10.09]Oh, this is somebody else's nest.
[52:13.57]Okay.
[52:15.81]Is somebody in an alleyway over here?
[52:17.33]You see that, like, blip on the map?
[52:19.23]Is somebody in one of these buildings?
[52:21.71]Or on the roof or something?
[52:25.81]I don't know.
[52:26.27]That's weird.
[52:26.91]I want to investigate this.
[52:28.79]Can we, like, get up there or not?
[52:29.75]Alright.
[52:31.23]Here's a challenge here.
[52:32.03]This might be an animal worth fighting.
[52:34.22]Right over here.
[52:34.54]We need to eat.
[52:39.35]What is it?
[52:40.03]It's Golden Retrievers.
[52:40.77]Okay.
[52:41.25]Two Golden Retrievers versus four chickens.
[52:44.19]All right, boys.
[52:44.79]This is where we have... This is the 10-year prove-yourself stream.
[52:49.47]Get him!
[52:50.73]Get him!
[52:53.29]Get the other one, too!
[52:55.05]No, eat this guy.
[52:55.61]I'll show you the fucking king of the goddamn jungle.
[53:03.08]Got a veteran in the team now.
[53:08.33]Here's the other one.
[53:09.13]Get him.
[53:10.11]He's trying to run.
[53:14.91]Don't fuck with the Pomeranians.
[53:16.37]Alright, we're doing good.
[53:19.69]We're gonna claim another air raid.
[53:23.70]That one shot.
[53:24.80]Uh-oh, it's night time.
[53:27.98]This is not good.
[53:29.04]Don't all the bad, scary things come out at night?
[53:33.32]Who cares?
[53:34.90]We have to claim the zone.
[53:35.89]I almost got it.
[53:36.61]How many more?
[53:37.47]Two more flags and I got this area for me.
[53:43.07]This might be very dangerous because I don't know what these are.
[53:46.86]If it's two golden retrievers, then... Head for Shibuya's shop district challenge.
[53:52.06]Okay, what is it?
[53:52.89]Hide here still.
[53:56.92]It's attack plus five.
[53:57.98]That's good.
[53:58.76]What is it?
[54:00.70]Watch it be a fucking alligator.
[54:01.94]I will seriously cry.
[54:03.44]What is it?
[54:05.20]What is it?
[54:07.23]It's a couple of sleeping sheep.
[54:09.35]Easy.
[54:10.13]Easy kills.
[54:10.65]Free food.
[54:13.51]Toxicity.
[54:15.25]Toxicity.
[54:17.97]God damn it.
[54:18.99]I was pressing circle to eat.
[54:21.77]And apparently... Apparently there's like a toxic cloud or something.
[54:26.83]What did that say?
[54:32.35]Where's the Pomeranian movie?
[54:34.31]I'm almost at boss.
[54:35.07]Are these things radioactive?
[54:37.61]Where are they going?
[54:38.43]Get over here.
[54:40.77]Toxicity plus two.
[54:43.57]Plus four.
[54:44.23]What the fuck is going on right now?
[54:48.32]Okay, I gotta read this, because... Help.
[54:52.85]Rank up story, females, items, toxicity.
[54:56.85]Breathing smog or consuming tainted food and water will fill the toxicity gauge.
[55:01.52]Watch out if the toxicity gauge reaches plus 100, you'll start to lose life.
[55:06.46]You can also get fleas.
[55:11.20]Multiplayer... Okay.
[55:14.13]I gotta get away from the smog, apparently.
[55:18.05]Got a couple of big boys over there.
[55:22.11]There's one animal this way.
[55:24.23]We could definitely overwhelm it, whatever it is.
[55:25.59]It's just, it's another Yorkie.
[55:30.24]Why are the Yorkies always by themselves?
[55:37.40]Okay, come over here, claim this.
[55:38.54]We got one more flag and we got this area too.
[55:43.52]One more.
[55:45.00]Oh, it's down to the right.
[55:45.96]Let's get this drive too.
[55:50.01]Do I have to sleep?
[55:51.25]What happens if I don't sleep?
[55:55.37]Okay.
[55:55.69]Sounds easy enough.
[55:56.63]So we have to complete this Pomeranian story now.
[56:01.31]And we have to claim this territory as our own.
[56:18.51]Haven't gone to bed in 12 years.
[56:19.65]Alright.
[56:22.61]Can I get... Should I... What happens when I bring this Pomeranian over here?
[56:29.48]Where is it?
[56:30.04]Okay, there's one... There's one way closer down here.
[56:35.56]Are we gonna have toxic babies?
[56:38.84]So I guess you unlock portions of story mode.
[56:42.32]Alright, what level am I?
[56:45.60]Okay, we got a... Dirty animals you touch may pass you their fleas.
[56:49.32]Fleas itch so badly that you'll sometimes be paralyzed.
[56:52.32]Bathe in some water or take medicine to get rid of them.
[56:56.18]This girl had fleas?
[56:58.88]What?
[57:00.46]Wow, I can't believe she gave me fleas.
[57:03.68]Okay.
[57:07.55]So do I get more Pomeranians?
[57:10.19]Oh boy.
[57:12.85]What's up there?
[57:19.46]I gotta get up there.
[57:20.04]How do I get up to that nest?
[57:22.84]I'm gonna fucking starve to death.
[57:24.91]Oh god, we gotta fuck before I die.
[57:27.45]How do I get up there?
[57:28.59]Oh no.
[57:29.49]How do I get up there?
[57:30.67]Shit.
[57:30.93]I don't know how to get up here.
[57:34.47]Right here.
[57:38.31]Kill the scroll!
[57:38.81]Quick!
[57:39.03]Get him!
[57:40.63]Damn it!
[57:41.59]Quick!
[57:41.83]Before I die!
[57:43.65]We have to fuck before I die.
[57:44.69]Quick!
[57:46.55]Eat this guy!
[57:48.23]He's in our house.
[57:51.11]Stop itching and eat him.
[57:52.01]All right, we're good.
[58:00.02]All right, let's do it.
[58:02.04]Here we go.
[58:02.72]You like dirty flea ridden woman.
[58:07.58]Oh, not in front of the children.
[58:09.38]Not in front of the children for crying out loud.
[58:34.98]I just spilled that fucking everywhere.
[58:37.00]God damn it.
[58:38.12]What the fuck?
[58:40.73]Thank God I have paper towels right behind me.
[58:45.45]No, it didn't get on the keyboard.
[58:46.73]Thank God.
[58:48.89]It just got all over the ground.
[58:53.47]Don't take a female with a black heart.
[58:57.97]Good advice for us all.
[58:59.34]You know what I mean?
[59:00.76]Good advice for all of us.
[59:07.71]Whatever.
[59:08.81]I'm gonna have to, like, clean this up later.
[59:10.35]Okay.
[59:18.50]Alright.
[59:20.22]So, um, now I am the third generation.
[59:23.58]And why are there only two?
[59:24.32]Wait, did I have, like, toxic seed?
[59:29.99]Yeah, I had, like, a toxic seed.
[59:31.49]I only have one brother.
[59:32.49]Claim the cat territory.
[59:45.94]What was up, what was up with my, like, sperm count there?
[59:49.80]What's going on there?
[59:51.56]I went from four to two?
[59:53.22]Are the generations really dwindling that badly?
[59:57.61]Alright, let's go... Where can I go from here?
[60:02.43]To the left?
[60:03.53]Yeah.
[60:03.83]Oh, he's got two.
[60:08.46]Do that quest to unlock the cats.
[60:11.88]Um... Jesus.
[60:16.05]Okay.
[60:16.77]Event in Dogenzaka.
[60:20.29]Do I have to run all the way up there, or can I, like, fast travel?
[60:22.65]I have to run all the fucking way over there, don't I?
[60:28.35]Okay, we're gonna go to Dogenzaka.
[60:29.69]There's no fast travel.
[60:37.46]I guess we're gonna have to... We're just gonna go this way.
[60:44.75]Up here.
[60:45.15]I don't want to lose my one friend.
[60:54.04]By the alligator.
[60:57.14]Oh, shit.
[60:57.64]That's so far away.
[60:58.80]This is going to take like five years to get there in-game.
[61:04.27]And I need to drink something, too.
[61:05.45]I need to wash.
[61:06.57]Do you pass fleas down?
[61:07.85]I need food.
[61:11.01]I don't think I'm going to make it.
[61:18.62]I don't see any wells.
[61:19.86]I don't see anything.
[61:23.38]I have to get up here and go left.
[61:28.60]These are genetic.
[61:29.32]I need to fucking... I need someone to drink.
[61:31.66]Thank God.
[61:32.40]That was a lifesaver.
[61:36.27]Another one over here.
[61:36.95]I'm going to drink this one too.
[61:39.93]Right?
[61:40.35]No, it's not.
[61:41.17]Okay.
[61:41.47]We'll just hope he's running to something.
[61:44.37]Fleas are in the womb.
[61:45.59]Possible.
[61:47.47]Possible.
[61:52.02]More water.
[61:55.78]This looks like it's gonna be a... Oh, no, wait, wait, okay, okay.
[62:00.15]We got something here.
[62:02.19]Something.
[62:04.45]Oh, it's just terrible chickens, thank God.
[62:08.79]Perfect.
[62:09.07]Eat.
[62:10.85]What?
[62:10.97]You didn't kill it?
[62:11.85]Come on.
[62:12.71]Do your due diligence, dude.
[62:14.58]Can I do everything?
[62:16.78]Don't be so useless.
[62:22.54]It's prenatal life.
[62:26.66]I'm in a toxic cloud.
[62:27.72]Oh, fuck, you're right, I am.
[62:31.05]These things didn't give any... Okay, I gotta claim... I gotta claim all this shit again?
[62:35.75]Oh, should've played alligator.
[62:44.56]Should've played alligator, you're right.
[62:47.86]Okay, these are all toxic animals.
[62:59.78]At least I don't need any food to kill this guy.
[63:01.60]Yeah, he's going the wrong way.
[63:06.36]Come on, man.
[63:07.86]Whatever.
[63:08.18]I don't even care.
[63:09.90]I knew I was going to be blocked off.
[63:11.28]It's all good.
[63:13.52]We've got to go all the way to the left.
[63:15.66]Let me zoom out.
[63:18.36]So if I just keep going left the whole way, I will run into the cat sanctuary.
[63:25.44]And I will claim this place for my... Oh, that's good.
[63:31.95]And there's food.
[63:34.55]61% toxicity.
[63:35.97]Shit.
[63:36.57]This is not good.
[63:39.19]Although it is lowering now, for some reason.
[63:40.99]I guess we're not in a toxic area anymore.
[63:46.64]That's good.
[63:51.82]Claim it.
[63:53.14]Territory occupied.
[63:54.03]Now I can use... I can mate...
[63:57.98]Might as well.
[63:59.28]Yeah, might as well have like another generation of little dumb dogs.
[64:03.08]Stamina plus five.
[64:03.80]No, you got black hearts.
[64:05.78]Nope.
[64:07.08]I ain't laying down with another woman with black heart.
[64:11.02]You know what?
[64:11.36]That's a lie.
[64:16.22]This desperate female is following you.
[64:21.58]Ah.
[64:24.82]Oh, she's... I get it.
[64:25.94]They're both desperate.
[64:27.18]Why is the other one desperate?
[64:30.38]Shit, if I have a bunch of, like, desperate women, I'm gonna have, like, a bad bloodline.
[64:38.18]Okay, we're gonna clean in the clean water, right?
[64:40.46]Apparently that's toxic.
[64:47.07]Can more than one female follow you?
[64:48.63]I don't think so.
[64:49.15]There's no more on the map.
[64:53.37]I gotta go back up here.
[64:54.03]So I lost this territory?
[64:57.04]How did I lose this territory?
[64:58.16]I've been here the whole time.
[65:02.16]Okay.
[65:03.82]Let's mate, I guess.
[65:08.36]That's my sibling.
[65:13.74]Generation change complete.
[65:14.68]Happy birthday, Pomeranian IV.
[65:16.70]Plus one life, plus one stamina.
[65:19.24]And something else.
[65:21.00]Still only two babies.
[65:23.02]Alright, let's move.
[65:26.49]It's dark.
[65:27.85]It's too dark.
[65:29.45]Okay, I'm gonna save it.
[65:31.05]Because, like, I haven't saved it at all.
[65:33.37]And I can't save it.
[65:35.25]Well, that was a fucking bonehead move.
[65:37.70]I can't save the game now.
[65:44.12]What is that?
[65:45.60]Oh, it's a black spot.
[65:48.32]Okay.
[65:49.76]Sure thing.
[65:50.24]We gotta get out of here.
[65:53.78]The shittier the mate, the less puppies.
[65:55.69]Alright, this next time we're finding a prime.
[65:58.67]A prime mate.
[66:01.57]We're gonna find a prime mate next time.
[66:03.65]And no, no, we're not talking about like a monkey.
[66:07.59]We're talking about like a prime mate.
[66:12.86]Let's just go all the way to the left and let's go fight the cats.
[66:21.62]Use your grandpapa's nest.
[66:23.26]Survive 20 years.
[66:27.46]The generation moves on.
[66:29.10]We still live.
[66:30.44]Another day.
[66:31.16]What is that?
[66:32.46]What is this?
[66:34.22]What is it?
[66:34.70]That's like toxic.
[66:35.44]I don't want to eat that.
[66:38.90]That's a big blip.
[66:39.89]That's a very large blip.
[66:42.68]Very lo- a bunch of large fucking blips.
[66:46.88]Oh, God.
[66:48.48]What is this?
[66:49.92]What's run- What is it?
[66:51.42]What is it?!
[66:53.81]Oh, it's a hyena.
[66:54.45]Okay.

[67:17.56]Got another one.
[67:24.41]Got them all.
[67:25.21]Nice work.
[67:26.41]Eat them.
[67:29.75]Alright.
[67:30.73]That could have gone bad.
[67:32.13]That was an actual animal gang.
[67:37.69]And there's a bunch more over there.
[67:38.73]Okay, now I'm ranked up.
[67:39.87]Good.
[67:40.03]What am I going to get?
[67:40.95]Plus like five attack?
[67:46.12]Let me take a look at the map here because... I'm on the outskirts.
[67:51.08]That's a toxic animal.
[67:52.24]I don't want to eat that.
[67:53.64]Look at how many are over here.
[67:57.30]This is bad news, man.
[67:58.56]I shouldn't be going.
[67:59.30]Let's hide and take a look.
[68:00.68]Okay, it looks like these are cats, I think.
[68:05.57]And they're hunting.
[68:06.05]They're hunting the rabbits.
[68:08.01]I gotta catch one off guard.

[71:15.32]Alright.
[71:15.90]I gotta chill for it.
[71:16.66]I gotta... I gotta get out of the rain.
[71:20.80]I still have... I have to go all the way to the left.
[71:25.51]We're just gonna run to the left.
[71:29.81]The area... Everything's too toxic.
[71:36.87]I gotta go fast.
[71:38.91]Hopefully the next area is not as toxic as this place is.
[71:47.28]I can't eat any of these things.
[71:49.28]Where's the next zone?
[71:51.09]We're there.
[71:51.77]We're there.
[71:53.13]We're in the next zone.
[71:56.39]Flag to claim here, and then I should have the fucking cat get away from me.
[72:02.47]I got the zone, right?
[72:04.17]No, not yet.
[72:05.07]He has to die.
[72:12.01]Can he kill?
[72:12.99]I don't think he's toxic yet.
[72:16.08]No, he's not good.
[72:16.70]Thank god.
[72:17.06]Keep going.
[72:21.66]Get me out of the fucking rain.
[72:27.34]Really?
[72:27.62]You're gonna fucking play me like that, game?
[72:37.62]If I can get this down to like 20, I'll be happy.
[72:42.52]It's been 26 years, we're good.
[72:45.08]Oh shit.
[72:50.56]Oh my fucking god.
[72:56.89]Gotta be careful.
[72:57.45]Look, I'm a strong fucking fourth generation Pomeranian, guys.
[73:01.27]Everything's gonna be fine.
[73:12.26]Do you think a bunch of fucking dumb cats are going to take on like a fourth generation Pomeranian?
[73:20.23]Bet your ass they're not.
[73:26.71]Oh, you fucking want to be a hero, huh?
[73:30.53]Big mistake.
[73:32.88]I want that guy to stay alive.
[73:33.78]Go tell your friends what you saw here.
[73:41.20]Alright, I'm good to go.
[73:42.50]I'm at boss rank.
[73:44.46]That means I gotta find a good prime woman.
[73:48.25]You know what I mean?
[73:49.31]Is there any animals I've killed?
[73:57.63]Give me a good, like, non-toxic woman.
[74:01.39]We've got more of an area to claim and then we're good.
[74:07.29]One more.
[74:07.63]What's that?
[74:08.03]What the hell is that?
[74:10.31]There's a bunny rabbit.
[74:11.07]Get it.
[74:16.43]Come here, you... Oh, fucking... Who cares?
[74:17.89]I'm good.
[74:21.37]Take the whole cat area.
[74:23.47]Kill this motherfucker, too.
[74:24.35]He didn't even know I'm here.
[74:33.14]Non-toxic.
[74:33.86]They're safe to eat.
[74:35.14]Did I get all the flags?
[74:36.04]I got one more flag, and then we're gonna find a good woman.
[74:43.52]Look at this.
[74:44.00]I'm unstoppable.
[74:45.64]I'm unstoppable.
[74:50.42]Oh my god.
[74:51.86]There's too many cats.
[74:54.70]I seriously am the king of the jungle though.
[74:56.04]They can't do anything.
[74:57.14]I'm unbeatable.
[74:59.24]Give me fucking a hundred cats.
[75:02.06]Good for you.
[75:02.58]Good luck.
[75:06.57]Wow, I just got bit.
[75:07.33]Did I get bit?
[75:12.73]Time to eat.

[75:23.62]No black hearts.
[75:27.38]How am I ever going to be like the biggest, strongest man?
[75:34.06]Pomeranian.
[75:35.52]I almost got 40,000 points.
[75:38.90]Oh shit, he's going to talk.
[75:41.17]Don't do that.
[75:45.01]I gotta find a non-toxic woman.
[75:48.93]What we got over here?
[75:50.43]Oh no.
[75:51.75]They became toxic.
[75:54.04]I gotta make some kills over here and find a woman.

[80:09.94]And here we go.
[80:14.34]Still, this toxicity is climbing.
[80:16.79]It won't stop.
[80:17.77]Come on, man.
[80:18.21]Am I going to lose the whole pack because of this shit?
[80:26.35]There's no food anywhere.
[80:29.59]Why do I keep losing Shibuya?
[80:32.10]I don't understand.
[80:33.00]Come on.
[80:34.52]Aren't I leaving behind two dogs every time?
[80:40.80]My thoughts on this game.
[80:43.51]Um...
[80:45.59]I don't have any items, do I?
[80:48.15]I think it's fun.
[80:49.67]It's fun to run around and kill animals and be afraid.
[80:54.17]And I mean that in like an in-game sense, by the way.
[80:58.80]It's so much fun to kill animals and be afraid.
[81:03.02]I mean like in the fucking wild, like this.
[81:08.10]Yeah, the toxic comes from the environment.
[81:10.88]It's like acid rain or something crazy.
[81:13.58]I have to make...
[81:15.93]This is unfortunate.
[81:19.71]All the way back.
[81:20.31]There's just one random girl over here.
[81:23.95]I'm starving.
[81:24.57]I have to do it.
[81:26.03]Come here.
[81:28.03]Are you a candidate?
[81:29.83]No, you're a cold, black-hearted bitch.
[81:34.45]I can't.
[81:35.15]No, I can't.
[81:35.80]Get away from her.
[81:40.88]No food.
[81:41.58]Desperate.
[81:42.40]There is no food here.
[81:43.54]I've eaten everything.
[81:46.95]Eater?
[81:47.63]No.
[81:49.13]Okay, now we're in a spot where I can potentially get something done.
[81:57.60]There we go.
[82:00.54]No, that's like a crow up there.
[82:04.50]I'm gonna lose another dog.
[82:07.28]Yep.
[82:08.16]Another dog dead.
[82:10.80]Not quite, not quite!
[82:12.18]Yeah.
[82:16.39]All this, the pack survived, it's okay.
[82:23.13]Lion cub?
[82:24.55]Oh shit, this is a bad idea.
[82:26.23]Holy shit, that's a really bad idea.
[82:28.63]I'm fighting fucking lions now.
[82:39.46]What am I talking about?
[82:40.64]Fucking fifth generation Pomeranian, dude.
[82:48.78]Bring on the lions.
[82:52.32]Kill it before the mom comes.
[82:53.84]That's a really good idea.
[82:54.56]That's actually a really good point.
[82:59.85]Thank you the whole keg for the bits.
[83:01.09]Chunky baloney for the bits.
[83:02.17]I had a dream we were trying to find parking in Boston and you told me Cam Newton had a brother named Cam McGankton.
[83:10.80]That's a really fucking weird dream.
[83:16.02]Nice over here.
[83:16.76]Thank you, Chunky baloney.
[83:19.96]more lion cubs to sneak up on this one sleeping or resting well this one just wants to play dead what is that what's happening what's that mean you see that that's killed the pack leader I think that was over that guy's head what did that mean but I'll thank you eeps for the five bucks ooh hearty chicken breast
[83:49.42]I think that meant he had an item run.
[83:52.76]Uh, thank you for the five bucks.
[83:54.30]Uh, this game is 18 plus for sex.
[83:57.73]You know, very well could be.
[84:00.41]Primo stamina jerky.
[84:01.67]Alright, I'm getting some items here.
[84:04.26]Thank you, The Ass Cream Man, for the 15 bucks.
[84:06.57]Take my money, nerd.
[84:07.89]Well, I absolutely will.

[84:11.01]Appreciate it.
[84:13.03]Tub Tucker, thanks for the bits.
[84:15.39]I, for one, welcome our new Pomeranian Overlord.
[84:18.51]So do I. Fuck.
[84:19.90]I gotta go claim that.
[84:25.06]The Lion Baby was calling for his mother.
[84:26.92]Okay, that.
[84:27.62]Good thing I killed it then.
[84:29.10]It's terrible to say out loud.
[84:31.80]Thank you, Eeps, again, for the 15 bucks.
[84:34.94]I love you, Jerma.
[84:36.48]You always make my shitty days into good ones.
[84:38.30]Well, thanks for hanging out.
[84:41.99]I'm glad that you can hang out here and have some fun.
[84:45.05]Appreciate it.
[84:48.83]Thanks for the $15.
[84:49.71]Thanks for, like, the $20, $30 for this one.
[84:51.43]Thank you, dudes.
[84:52.23]That's the Pomeranian that died, alright?
[84:56.78]Thank you, Magic Man, for the bits.
[84:59.76]And mostly lost, thanks for the bits as well.
[85:02.58]Also, Djem... Djembiman!
[85:06.48]Three bucks.
[85:07.51]Local streamer raves on stream about sex and killing animals.
[85:12.43]Well... I mean, we are in the wild.
[85:15.71]That is what's happening.
[85:18.12]I need to go up.
[85:18.76]This is a waste of time.
[85:21.60]Well, look at all the food that's down here in the suburbs.
[85:26.53]I want to mate again and get enough... I want him with a pack of four.
[85:31.77]Before I go back up again.
[85:32.76]That was all... How do you... Is there a way to deal with being toxic?
[85:37.44]Or do you just have to deal with it?
[85:40.18]And like sprint around and eat?
[85:43.99]I'm gonna die again.
[85:44.95]There's nothing down here.
[85:50.64]Right there.
[85:52.50]Shit.
[85:52.80]I'm gonna lose it.
[85:54.42]Eating low is it.
[85:55.25]I'm gonna lose another fucking dog.
[85:57.13]God damn it!
[86:04.21]Oh well.
[86:05.13]I'll have one more dog to, like, get laid.
[86:09.91]Wait, can I, like, have babies before I die?
[86:11.77]Alright, come on.
[86:13.59]Give me, like, a girl right here.
[86:15.03]Right here.
[86:15.33]Come on.
[86:16.35]Be good to me.
[86:19.81]Bottled water.
[86:23.19]Raises maximum level of hunger gauge.
[86:27.79]Oh, wow.
[86:28.21]Okay, that's good.
[86:29.27]We're good.
[86:31.97]Alright, is this a good candidate?
[86:34.15]Good candidate.
[86:34.80]Okay, let's take it back to the nest.
[86:35.80]Let's cause a little bit of a ruckus.
[86:43.68]Scans?
[86:44.16]What do you mean I got scammed?
[86:49.59]I've survived for a fairly long time.
[86:51.04]We're going on to 40 years.
[86:57.74]Come back to the lair.
[87:00.72]Let's make... Let's save it.
[87:03.12]Save the game.
[87:05.85]I'm still playing this.
[87:06.97]I'm actually having a fairly good time.
[87:08.63]It's not a bad game.
[87:09.57]It's fun to be this animal.
[87:11.47]It's fun.
[87:17.88]You're wasting your alpha male genes on this basic thing.
[87:21.62]Oh, God.
[87:25.35]We did unlock some story mode stuff, but I want to... Let's get to the end of this.
[87:29.41]I'm going to go as long as I can on this Pomeranian.
[87:34.45]Thank you, Dinkman, for this.
[87:36.41]Jeremiah had sexual intercourse with a dog on stream.
[87:40.48]Why did I waste... Why did I, like... Why did I waste my breath saying that I had a dog on stream?
[87:47.73]Why did I waste my breath saying that I, like, had sex?
[87:49.81]Okay, we're not gonna say it again.
[87:52.37]There's a story?
[87:53.49]I don't know if it's, like, necessarily a story.
[87:56.78]Defense plus one.
[87:59.00]Yeah, we got three dogs now.
[88:04.16]Alright.
[88:06.62]I think it's time to go to Shibuya Woods.
[88:08.97]An ancient showdown has begun in Shibuya Woods.
[88:11.27]Let's go.
[88:11.67]We're going there.
[88:14.89]Plus ten attack.
[88:18.22]These little puppies are so... This is a dangerous, like, seventh generation dog.
[88:24.68]Savings unnecessary unless you're afraid of crashing.
[88:26.66]Okay, let's get down.
[88:27.36]We gotta go to the ancient showdown, quickly.
[88:38.41]The main dog is really old.
[88:39.81]Well, not anymore.
[88:43.33]He's back somewhere over in the other, like, area.
[88:45.61]Alright, so we gotta go this way.
[88:50.18]Ancient equals dinosaurs.
[88:51.24]Does that mean I can unlock dinosaurs?
[88:54.46]If I unlock dinosaurs, I'm saving and I'm going to play as a dinosaur.
[89:02.04]We might actually get to see a Velociraptor.
[89:07.62]Where are we going?
[89:08.30]Just straight up.
[89:09.38]This is going to take a while.
[89:10.86]We're going to go all the way around too.
[89:15.76]Why am I just permanently toxic?
[89:18.67]Is this a bloodline thing?
[89:19.79]Is this a generational thing?
[89:22.88]Am I just constantly toxic because I was toxic every time I had sex?
[89:27.16]Makes sense, right?
[89:28.92]Straight up into the web.
[89:35.11]Don't forget to buy the gator.
[89:36.37]40 years.
[89:40.31]Oh, we got food here.
[89:45.52]The area I'm in is just toxic.
[89:46.94]Oh, whatever.
[89:50.06]Can I get him?
[89:51.88]Okay.
[89:52.22]What's up?
[89:52.54]What's up?
[89:52.90]What's sixth grade?
[89:54.02]Sixth graders.
[89:55.28]We can get him.
[90:00.36]What the fuck is this?
[90:02.32]What is this Dark Souls boss?
[90:04.25]Whoa.
[90:08.65]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[90:09.73]Watch out, you idiots.
[90:34.20]Oh well.
[90:35.42]Fuck!
[90:39.97]I didn't know it was... Come on, I got like 50 million points!
[90:45.93]Look, at least we can be like a cat now.
[90:50.59]Get the gator!
[90:52.85]Ah, damn it!
[90:53.71]That was like a legit, like, fucking boss!
[90:57.79]Shit!
[90:59.21]A new story has been added, a new archive has been added.
[91:01.49]Let's go to story, let's take a look.
[91:04.80]Okay, we got pampered to survival mode.
[91:07.50]The pet food at home has run out and there's no one left to care for you.
[91:10.96]You must now fend for yourself.
[91:12.10]It's time to wake the wild beast within the Pomeranian.
[91:14.97]We unlocked the Pomeranian story.
[91:18.65]Alright, hold on.
[91:19.61]I'll be right back.
[91:20.47]I'm going to pee.
[91:21.87]I will return in like five minutes.
[91:23.40]We're going to do the Pomeranian storyline.
[91:26.70]Be right back.
[94:24.51]Okay.
[94:28.56]Cheesecake.
[94:31.98]Was everybody saying cheesecake?
[94:35.06]Cheesecake.
[94:38.38]Chat's going so fast I don't want to know there's a cheesecake on stream.
[94:40.96]Okay.
[94:41.16]What the fuck are you guys talking about?
[94:47.44]What are you guys on about?
[94:50.21]Thank you, Bada Bing.
[94:50.87]It's Ben for the five bucks.
[94:52.05]What did you think was going to happen?
[94:53.13]I don't know.
[94:54.01]We're talking sixth generation sixth graders.
[94:58.07]Sixth grade pomegranians.
[95:00.31]Sixth generation pomegranates taking on one lion S. I had confidence.
[95:06.87]I had like plus 20 attack and plus like 30 stamina.
[95:13.64]I'm lactose intolerant.
[95:15.83]But thank you, Bada Bing, for the five bucks.
[95:18.51]Let's go.
[95:19.41]Let's do the Pomeranian survival.
[95:22.49]I guess we're going to see what this storyline is.
[95:25.63]Is there a cutscene?
[95:26.33]Probably.
[95:27.80]Shibuya suburbs.
[95:32.88]Yeah, my fucking Pomegranians.
[95:35.50]This apartment is home to a Pomeranian, now without an owner.
[95:41.29]Okay.
[95:45.06]The once generous food stores have hit rock bottom.
[95:47.67]Oh.
[95:49.21]He's got like a bag of Doritos left.
[95:51.67]The days of being a coddled pet are at an end.
[95:54.67]He's out of peanut butter.
[95:55.97]Okay.
[95:57.67]The time to rise from toy dog to noble beast is at hand.
[96:09.74]Eat your owner.
[96:14.39]Oh, look, unlocking cosmetics.
[96:17.31]Your first day with no pet food has come and gone.
[96:19.67]If you have no luck hunting, you'll starve to death.
[96:23.57]Oh, no, he has a funny shirt on, too.
[96:25.27]He's so huge.
[96:29.23]Hunt a rabbit and eat your fill.
[96:30.26]Okay.
[96:30.70]Pamper to survive.
[96:31.48]So we just gotta... I look really, like, constrained in this thing.
[96:41.32]I look like I'm really, really struggling to fit in this.
[96:46.53]Streamer ignores bits.
[96:47.65]What are you talking about?
[96:48.72]What did I miss?
[96:52.12]Oh, from like when I was in the bathroom.
[96:53.62]Well, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[96:55.34]Hold on.
[96:56.76]Let's kill a couple of rabbits and then I'll read the bits.
[96:59.66]Creep.
[97:01.44]Wait, they didn't teach me that.
[97:03.75]They didn't teach me creep.
[97:07.35]I didn't know that there was a creep function in this game.
[97:09.35]L1.
[97:17.60]That one.
[97:20.06]Oh, I'm, like, losing health back.
[97:23.44]What is this music?
[97:24.22]It's shit, is what it is.
[97:30.62]Excellent.
[97:36.54]Uh, thank you, the Gunther, for the bits.
[97:38.92]This is the only game where you can watch dogs fuck, but you can't watch them pee.
[97:43.47]Night is falling, find a safe place to make your bed.
[97:48.89]Okay, so over there.
[97:51.23]So do I unlock another thing if I beat the storyline for the dog?
[97:56.79]Get over there.
[97:57.41]What the fuck?
[97:59.43]Why don't you get over there?
[98:01.79]Do I have to creep over there?
[98:06.83]Get over there, dude.
[98:08.13]I can't just walk over there?
[98:10.05]I have to go around.
[98:10.83]No, I gotta go up.
[98:11.77]Okay.
[98:12.01]I'm introducing more platforming.
[98:22.22]I don't think you can fall off that.
[98:23.22]That's a good thing.
[98:23.78]I can't jump off.
[98:30.92]Good to know.
[98:31.42]I can play as a robot dog.
[98:35.57]Really?
[98:37.27]That is so dumb.
[98:40.71]That is really dumb.
[98:45.03]It's the lair's owner.
[98:45.85]Defeat him and claim it for your own.
[98:47.19]Okay, there he is.
[98:48.11]There's the...
[98:51.06]I tell you, that's how you fucking do it right.
[98:55.01]Turn the music off.
[98:56.13]Why does everybody hate the music so bad?
[99:01.29]Is the music that much of a piece of shit?
[99:08.33]Why?
[99:08.45]Because it's going like this?
[99:09.45]Like, I mean, it sucks.
[99:11.37]I know.
[99:11.61]Uh-oh.
[99:11.83]First boss.
[99:23.39]Fat cat.
[99:25.96]Oh, God.
[99:30.92]Is there a lock on?
[99:31.76]He's kicking the shit out of me, dude.
[99:33.02]I'm going to die.
[99:47.18]Ah, shit.
[99:47.50]I had it.
[99:49.34]Got it.
[99:49.78]Okay.
[99:54.10]Just need to kill Garfield and we can go on our merry way.
[100:02.22]Let's go on the box.
[100:08.79]You killed the cat and claimed its territory.
[100:13.09]You're far from a toy dog.
[100:14.56]You're a bonafide hunter now.
[100:18.44]You're overwhelmed by a new sense that you could never have felt before.
[100:21.35]Oh, he tasted blood for the first time.
[100:25.77]You killed fucking Garfield.
[100:27.39]Good for you.
[100:27.87]Okay, so... That's it?
[100:44.70]That's it?
[100:45.14]That's the story?
[100:46.38]That's the whole story?
[100:48.52]Okay.
[100:50.13]Alright, cool.
[100:51.01]I got the story.
[100:54.73]We got a new game here.
[100:58.31]Alright.
[100:58.85]We got a cat.
[101:00.05]We unlocked the cat.
[101:02.03]Can we unlock anybody else?
[101:03.37]No alligator yet.
[101:06.23]At least we can be the cat.
[101:07.12]Let's try cat.
[101:07.88]14,000 points.
[101:10.08]6G.
[101:10.18]What is 6G?
[101:12.70]What the fuck does that mean?
[101:15.38]Oh, I have to spend these.
[101:16.48]I have to spend my points.
[101:20.11]Alright, let's unlock the cat.
[101:25.17]Alright.
[101:26.85]Fuck the cat, buy the alligator.
[101:30.81]No!
[101:32.77]No!
[101:36.54]I don't want to buy the fucking alligator.
[101:40.38]Oh, this is first generation.
[101:43.76]Alright, okay, I get it.
[101:44.82]I'm starting to understand.
[101:46.46]This is sixth generation Pomeranian.
[101:52.80]You want me to buy the fucking alligator?
[101:54.84]You want me to buy this stupid alligator?
[102:02.27]Buy the super pomegranate?
[102:03.61]No, I don't- just give me- I- alright.
[102:06.03]First of all, okay, how about this?
[102:08.77]Buy the human?
[102:10.17]There's a human?
[102:11.21]No, there's not.
[102:13.07]No, we're gonna play with the cat.
[102:13.87]We're gonna do this the right way.
[102:15.43]Okay?
[102:16.07]I promise I will buy the alligator.
[102:19.33]I'm gonna buy the fucking alligator.
[102:21.71]But not yet.
[102:24.63]Not yet.
[102:26.09]I will buy the... Okay, we're going to have to do a poll because it's either going to be... Alligator... Why would you ever want to unlock the shitty Yorkie?
[102:38.16]For money.
[102:39.64]This guy costs money.
[102:40.76]Why?
[102:42.74]Okay, we're going to either do Kangaroo, Giraffe... Kangaroo... Oh, look, there's an elephant.
[102:51.45]Kangaroo, Giraffe, or Alligator.
[102:54.46]If you guys wanna see this fucking alligator, this is gonna be like 10 bucks.
[102:57.20]I'm gonna do the cat.
[102:59.95]Hold this, ooh, wait a minute.
[103:03.21]We got different kinds of cats here.
[103:05.15]I could be Garfield.
[103:10.42]Holy shit, that was, wait a minute, that was a lot of points.
[103:17.74]I can beat Garfield.
[103:18.66]No, that was 45,000 points.
[103:21.90]Was that a mistake?
[103:23.56]Should I not have done that?
[103:24.30]Well, at least we get to beat Garfield.
[103:29.83]What have I done?
[103:31.89]I spent all my points on a skin.
[103:36.10]Now I'm committed.
[103:40.23]Alright, at least we give you the cat.
[103:41.83]This is gonna be good.
[103:42.77]Alright, let's speedrun this.
[103:43.79]Let's get up to fucking a hundred year old cat.
[103:46.47]How old is Garfield?
[103:47.55]Somebody look it up.
[103:49.13]Somebody look it up right now.
[103:50.79]How long has Garfield been in the newspapers?
[103:54.35]We're gonna be- We're gonna get as old as Garfield is in real life.
[104:07.45]39?
[104:08.80]Garfield is 39 years old?
[104:11.90]45?
[104:11.94]Since 1978.
[104:12.18]He's 39.
[104:12.98]Okay.
[104:14.98]We have to get to be 39 years old.
[104:17.10]At least.
[104:22.56]It all takes us one Monday.
[104:24.39]There's a big thing over here.
[104:26.33]Gotta get rid of these fucking chickens.
[104:31.67]First generation.
[104:32.41]Oh my god.
[104:32.93]First generation sucks.
[104:35.09]Where are my sixth grade Pomeranians?
[104:38.12]It takes like five swings to kill a rabbit.
[104:48.58]Characters are only one dollar, so I'll just buy them all.
[104:50.84]Whatever, fuck it.
[104:51.50]If I had any decency, I'd let Garfield die.
[104:55.47]Are you gonna fight me, motherfucker?
[104:59.13]Did you see the way he was running up on me?
[105:00.35]It looked like he was gonna try to kill me.
[105:07.01]Yeah, how come I can't be my sixth generation animal?
[105:10.84]I gotta be this fucking millennial cat?
[105:13.74]Oh, great.
[105:17.88]Move.
[105:27.02]Be brave.
[105:28.46]Buy the dinosaurs.
[105:29.36]That's actually true, too.
[105:30.26]I should buy the dinosaurs.
[105:32.58]Jeremy, you're a millennial.
[105:33.72]I know.
[105:34.58]You don't think I know this?
[105:37.31]I am a millennial.
[105:39.33]That's the joke.
[105:40.05]I am a millennial.
[105:44.63]Oh my god, the fucking millennials are killing the napkin industry and now they're playing as cats?
[105:54.11]Old streamer yells at children.
[105:56.87]I'm gonna go this way.
[106:00.10]No, you're not.
[106:00.52]Yes, I am.
[106:05.38]I am a millennial, guys.
[106:06.46]You don't like... Do I need to fucking spell it out for you?
[106:13.46]I thought I was 45.
[106:15.08]No!
[106:16.38]No!
[106:22.21]1985.
[106:22.23]Yeah, it's millennial.
[106:23.89]I'm like one of the last years.
[106:25.07]There's only like two more years forward for millennial.
[106:28.35]I'm still a millennial.
[106:29.11]I'm still a baby.
[106:30.11]I'm just a kid, guys.
[106:31.09]I'm still a kid.
[106:35.97]Ooh, we'll get a treat.
[106:36.83]Portable bed.
[106:37.75]Nice.
[106:44.68]I'm Vinny's age.
[106:46.14]Yeah, well... Yeah, so... I'm not older than Garfield.
[106:52.23]Garfield's way older than me.
[106:53.75]By, like, nine years, actually.
[106:59.01]I'm not older than Garfield.
[107:00.55]Stop saying that, or I'm gonna get upset.
[107:02.51]Alright, let's mate for the first time.
[107:05.45]Let's find another, like, female Garfield.
[107:07.46]What was the female Garfield's name?
[107:08.68]Nah, get out of here.
[107:14.02]There was a female Garfield.
[107:15.10]What was her name?
[107:15.61]Like, Lola?
[107:20.37]What was her name?
[107:27.61]I feel like the cat is not even faster than the Pomeranian.
[107:36.92]Arlene.
[107:37.52]That was her name.
[107:38.28]Arlene.
[107:41.04]Yes.
[107:41.52]I have to find an Arlene.
[107:45.28]Alright, we got some baby chickies.
[107:49.11]Free food.
[107:49.69]I want to get to boss before I have any relationships with anybody.
[107:59.29]Although I do want to pick up those things over there.
[108:01.59]Where are they?
[108:02.03]Okay, Garfield trivia incoming, yeah.
[108:09.26]Come here.
[108:10.20]Come here.
[108:11.22]Come on.
[108:12.88]Alright, am I good enough yet?
[108:20.13]Nermal?
[108:22.87]Were there more than one fucking love interest for Garfield?
[108:26.89]I thought there was only one.
[108:29.83]Arlene was the girl that John wanted to be with, right?
[108:36.35]She was like the veterinarian.
[108:38.73]Guys, you don't think I know my Garfield lore?
[108:44.10]And John always brought Garfield, and Garfield always said something stupid in front of Arlene.
[108:50.84]Nermal was not a love interest.
[108:52.80]Yes, she was.
[109:00.89]What was the guy?
[109:03.58]No, no, no, we're talking about Spike.
[109:06.24]Spike was the love interest.
[109:07.32]They're both just, like, just shitty.
[109:10.70]Just, these girls, I don't want any of these women.
[109:12.77]Alright, we're gonna have to lay down with, like, a real, like, unscrupulous female.
[109:19.21]Because there's only two that exist, and this is one of them, apparently.
[109:22.05]Desperate.
[109:29.99]We have to lay down with an unscrupulous woman.
[109:34.39]Come on.
[109:34.95]Get up here.
[109:35.27]What are you doing?
[109:37.93]Get up here.
[109:40.21]No, don't get locked over here.
[109:41.89]Come with me.
[109:44.17]Fleas duck.
[109:45.43]Great.
[109:46.21]Now the bloodline is tainted.
[109:49.11]We have a flea-ridden lady.
[109:51.51]We have a flea-ridden... I can't even say it.
[109:55.63]Flea-riddled lady of the night.
[110:06.34]No generational changes at all.
[110:09.34]All I got was plus one toxicity.
[110:12.30]And they're tiny.
[110:14.10]That's great.
[110:15.26]Oh, there we go.
[110:18.18]I want to collect these three down here.
[110:19.66]Garfield sensor.
[110:29.15]We have to defeat the Beagle boss.
[110:33.51]Where's the Beagle?
[110:35.11]There's a Beagle boss?
[110:42.52]Intake 2,000 calories.
[110:44.00]Where's the Beagle?
[110:46.38]Defeat the Beagle boss in Shibuya Woods.
[110:51.05]Okay, so I have 30 years to go fight Odie in Shibuya Woods.
[110:56.73]We're not ready for that yet.
[110:57.75]We're not even close to being ready for that.
[111:03.45]We need at least third generation Garfield before we do that.
[111:15.46]We're gonna go down here, we're gonna get third generation, and then we're gonna go up and fight Odie.
[111:20.10]Beagle.
[111:25.07]I can't take a Beagle?
[111:25.93]Yes, I can.
[111:26.41]Dude, I was beating Golden Retrievers as the little puffball dogshit dog.
[111:35.20]You know how shitty a Pomeranian is?
[111:36.76]You guys ever, like, played with a Pomeranian?
[111:39.88]Their bite is like a gerbil biting your finger.
[111:42.94]You ever been bit by a gerbil before?
[111:44.24]I've been bit by a gerbil, like, at least a dozen times.
[111:47.47]Not a big deal.
[111:50.19]Talking about, like, a cat.
[111:52.21]You ever been scratched by a cat before?
[111:54.07]It sucks.
[111:55.65]Not fun.
[111:59.29]Shit, I'm gonna die.
[112:07.17]I need food, like, right now.
[112:09.21]And there's no food here.
[112:10.03]Where the fuck is the food?
[112:11.57]Where are all the other animals?
[112:15.26]Come on.
[112:15.76]I need something to fight.
[112:17.68]I need something to eat.
[112:20.68]Where are all the animals?
[112:22.26]This bloodline is going to be terrible.
[112:24.90]It's going to be fucking awful.
[112:26.25]We're going to lose this one.
[112:29.91]Tell me there's nothing to fight here.
[112:37.95]God damn it.
[112:38.85]There's nothing to fight.
[112:39.97]There's nothing.
[112:40.65]It's zero.
[112:41.27]No food!
[112:45.63]Well, this one's dead.
[112:46.39]It's alright.
[112:48.09]This is not the original Garfield, but fine.
[112:53.01]Okay, buy clone Garfield.
[112:58.18]Is there a lasagna mod?
[112:59.56]I don't know.
[113:03.28]Now I have to have sex with another flea-ridden, desperate person, and this bloodline is ruined.
[113:08.08]Pet food.
[113:09.32]Wish I ran into that earlier.
[113:10.44]That would have been good.
[113:15.38]Okay.
[113:17.15]I can't eat him, unfortunately.
[113:18.33]I wish I could.
[113:24.81]Unsavory.
[113:25.45]What?
[113:26.73]Ooh!
[113:27.65]Look, she's pristine!
[113:28.49]She's pristine.
[113:30.11]She doesn't like me.
[113:31.81]Fuck.
[113:33.84]Oh, come on.
[113:34.26]You're such a pristine female.
[113:35.80]My bloodlines aren't good enough.
[113:38.80]No.
[113:39.37]I have to go sleep with, like... I gotta go all the way up there to find somebody to sleep with?
[113:43.71]Nope.
[113:43.89]We're going this way.
[113:44.59]I have to marry that lady.
[113:48.19]I have to show my worth.
[113:53.18]What do I need to be?
[113:53.84]Like, not a rookie?
[113:56.88]I forgot.
[113:57.26]This is the new one.
[114:00.72]After killing all these, I should get it.
[114:09.12]She's too rich for me.
[114:10.48]Well, now I'm going to come back and I'm going to be picking Sprong.
[114:15.58]She's going to be so happy to see me.
[114:18.79]I need to get to Veteran, I think.
[114:20.59]Probably higher than that, actually.
[114:22.17]If she's that picky.
[114:23.97]Probably higher than Veteran.
[114:24.85]Come on, there's lots of presents.
[114:30.56]Bottled water, that's good.
[114:34.14]There's so many animals here.
[114:35.34]And there's another cat.
[114:36.64]Okay.
[114:38.39]Is that a big cat or is that a small cat?
[114:40.57]I can't really tell.
[114:41.33]I think it's just a... I think... Yeah, okay.
[114:44.09]It's Creepon.
[114:49.11]Fat cat.
[114:49.81]Got him.
[114:51.86]Kitty paws.
[114:52.56]What did I just get?
[114:58.28]What did I just... What happened?
[115:00.00]I just killed a fat cat and I got some kind of unlockable?
[115:06.28]New costume.
[115:09.94]Cannibalism?
[115:11.40]That's not cann- I didn't eat it yet.
[115:12.64]Not cannibalism yet.
[115:14.00]Dammit.
[115:16.84]I thought the newspaper was an animal.
[115:21.21]Alright, let's get this thing.
[115:23.97]Try to unlock another storyline.
[115:30.14]Whoa!
[115:32.10]Whoa, somebody just gave fifty fucking dollars!
[115:36.13]Hold on.
[115:38.35]Oh shit, these are wolves.
[115:40.58]If I take out one... No, this is a bad idea.
[115:45.58]I'm only one person to attack.
[115:47.64]How many are here?
[115:48.66]Here?
[115:48.90]Are these the rabbits?
[115:54.99]No, I'm gonna get instantly killed.
[116:03.77]Oh, fuck yeah.
[116:04.49]No way.
[116:05.47]Unless I pull off some really wacky shit.
[116:11.57]No, run.
[116:12.79]Run.
[116:13.43]Run!
[116:14.02]Run!
[116:15.50]Don't fuck around.
[116:16.08]I don't even have a wife yet.
[116:17.62]Garfield needs to get to 39 years old.
[116:20.54]No, that's not gonna help me.
[116:25.04]Eat.
[116:25.20]Alright, we're okay.
[116:29.80]I'm veteran now, so she should like me, right?
[116:35.31]I hope so.
[116:35.77]Let's find out.
[116:36.39]There's a couple more on the way I can get rid of.
[116:37.71]But hold on.
[116:38.61]Somebody gave a fucking bunch of money.
[116:43.60]Is that bunny just trying to go into the tree?
[116:46.42]Alright.
[116:47.02]Lusigi.
[116:47.62]Oh, Lusigi.
[116:49.20]Thank you for the $50.
[116:49.62]And they say...
[116:54.48]Well, like, that's...
[117:24.56]I'm fucking... I'm ecstatic that you're feeling better.
[117:30.04]Like, trust me, from somebody that's not fucking felt the greatest in the world before, I'm extremely happy that you're feeling like that 2017 is like fucking the best year of your life.
[117:44.84]Keep going, dude.
[117:47.44]That video was real.
[117:48.46]Like, I mean, I might have fallen out of the gym recently, but...
[117:56.81]Did she she went from like extremely desirable to desperate in two years Well, it's not to take that what hold on so she went what did she go from like did she go from like 28 to 30?
[118:10.12]That's what happened to me God damn it.
[118:12.41]I Don't want a desperate woman.
[118:17.25]Oh god damn it.
[118:18.07]It has to be a desperate woman.
[118:19.21]Oh
[118:22.20]Come with me.
[118:22.90]Let's go.
[118:25.28]Thank you.
[118:26.92]Uh... I've, uh... I've had my share of fucking dumb shit that I've had to deal with in my life, too.
[118:36.59]I think everybody does.
[118:37.35]Everybody, like, has that fucking stupid shit that you have to do.
[118:41.67]Or deal with.
[118:42.87]Yeah, life can be kind of fucking annoying sometimes.
[118:47.68]But...
[118:49.28]You know, I'm still here.
[118:50.68]You know, I'm still going.
[118:55.28]I'm glad that you're feeling better, man.
[118:56.60]I really am.
[119:00.58]We got two cats now.
[119:05.38]Can't use your parents' nest.
[119:06.38]Like, do I even have any, like, added attributes?
[119:14.73]I do want to see that.
[119:15.79]I want to see, like, the Beagle battle.
[119:18.76]I only have 17 more years to fight the dog.
[119:24.42]What generation am I?
[119:25.54]Millennial.
[119:29.22]I need to get those other two fucking Christmas cards.
[119:32.25]Hold on.
[119:33.11]How far away are they?
[119:34.91]I have to get them, right?
[119:36.51]I need to unlock.
[119:37.13]I gotta unlock my shit.
[119:38.27]I gotta get the two Christmas cards before we do this.
[119:47.40]This is annoying.
[119:48.32]This is a trek I don't want to do, but I need to do it.
[119:50.16]Alright, easy.
[119:56.33]This is a fat cat right here.
[120:00.09]Clean kill.
[120:02.71]Can't eat our own, unfortunately.
[120:05.37]Why am I upset about that?
[120:06.67]I can't eat our own.
[120:07.49]That sucks.
[120:11.66]I'm just a fucking baby boomer?
[120:14.38]I'm not.
[120:18.53]What is Millennial?
[120:19.18]What is it?
[120:20.56]It's like, the cap is like 35, right?
[120:23.96]Or like 33, 34?
[120:29.52]I fit into that category.
[120:30.80]I'm a Millennial.
[120:40.41]83 to 95 is Millennial.
[120:42.71]That's right.
[120:47.17]I got a couple of flags here.
[120:56.66]You reach a young adulthood during the early 2000s.
[120:58.44]That's what I did.
[120:59.38]84 to 95.
[121:05.10]Yeah.
[121:05.38]Jeremy is one of those people who has been celebrating their 21st birthday for 30 years.
[121:16.68]What are you talking about?
[121:18.84]What have I been trying to celebrate?
[121:20.23]I don't talk about my age.
[121:21.69]I know I'm, like, an old motherfucker.
[121:23.29]I know this.
[121:23.77]I don't need to, like, pretend like I'm not, like, fucking 30.
[121:28.11]You guys all know that.
[121:31.85]I'm, like, trying to hide my age from you guys.
[121:36.17]No, I gotta eat.
[121:37.61]Right now.
[121:39.69]Cornered.
[121:43.63]Getting old sucks.
[121:45.05]I used to think that way, but not anymore.
[121:48.53]I used to be like, oh man, I'm getting old, everything sucks.
[121:51.37]I mean, not really.
[121:55.23]Everything's pretty much the same as I was 10 years ago.
[121:59.38]Just got a little saggier, that's all.
[122:01.62]And that's okay, that's okay.
[122:02.86]I'm not ashamed of it.
[122:13.35]32, don't forget, I'm not 32.
[122:16.04]How do you think I'm 32?
[122:16.86]We didn't celebrate a birthday yet.
[122:18.22]I would have celebrated my birthday on stream.
[122:22.66]I would have had a birthday party hat on.
[122:24.18]I'm literally melting.
[122:30.27]Secret.
[122:33.07]No, not a secret.
[122:34.13]Secret.
[122:37.93]Not even a real secret.
[122:41.56]A lot of animals up there.
[122:42.92]Fuck.
[122:46.11]No, I need this food.
[122:47.07]Come on.
[122:49.77]There we go.
[122:53.78]I was born in 1985.
[122:54.80]Yes, I was.
[123:00.00]Yeah, gravity is not that kind to you anymore.
[123:03.87]But that doesn't mean that you have to be sad about it.
[123:08.57]Age is wisdom.
[123:11.10]I know things.
[123:11.82]I'm very wise.
[123:13.30]I know a lot of things.
[123:14.64]I've seen a lot of things.
[123:16.54]I'm experienced.
[123:18.36]Very experienced.
[123:22.91]Birthday stream sure is coming.
[123:24.97]You'll see it.
[123:30.61]Gravity isn't kind, do I?
[123:31.95]Oh, come on, man.
[123:35.29]Isn't my birthday like in a month?
[123:37.91]We don't talk about my birthday.
[123:40.94]I don't want to talk about my birthday.
[123:42.00]It saddens me.
[123:42.90]It fucking depresses me.
[123:43.84]I don't want to talk about my birthday.
[123:45.12]You know how old I'm going to be?
[123:46.76]That saddens me.
[123:49.21]Getting old sucks.
[123:50.25]Don't listen to what anybody ever tells you.
[123:52.37]Where am I?
[123:53.93]What the hell is this?
[123:58.03]What is going on here?
[123:59.45]There are fucking monkeys down here.
[124:00.79]What the fuck is this?
[124:07.50]I found the secret monkey lair.
[124:12.63]Okay.
[124:14.57]I guess we're gonna clear this place of monkeys.
[124:18.76]And they're scared, too, because I'm a cat.
[124:22.44]Oh, the chimpanzees really don't do anything, huh?
[124:25.14]They just kind of run around in circles.
[124:28.29]I kind of want to be a chimpanzee.
[124:30.47]Oh, whatever.
[124:30.87]They like running.
[124:31.41]I have to, like...
[124:38.85]Why are they in the sewer?
[124:41.67]Like, that's not the habitat for a, like, monkey.
[124:48.03]I might actually get this to boss down here.
[124:49.45]What does the monkey have?
[124:52.22]A headlamp.
[124:54.70]What?
[124:56.78]Change items through the menu screen.
[124:58.38]Wait, there actually is equippable items?
[125:08.64]And I have shoes.
[125:09.96]Cute shoes.
[125:10.74]Are you serious?
[125:15.72]Okay, that's so dumb.
[125:18.44]Alright, well, I'll take it.
[125:19.50]Let's get the boss while we're down here.
[125:27.74]This monkey's fighting back.
[125:28.86]He's actually doing a pretty good job.
[125:32.79]And there are wolves down here, too.
[125:34.97]I gotta be really careful down here.
[125:37.11]What are those?
[125:37.47]Are those hedgehogs?
[125:40.91]Hedgehogs and wolves.
[125:47.74]I think we can take those wolves.
[125:52.34]Monkeys have a lot of meat on them.
[125:53.36]This is great.
[125:56.18]There it is.
[125:56.46]Plus a thousand calories.
[125:59.74]Okay, now I gotta be careful.
[126:00.82]Let's sneak over here.
[126:04.26]While they're distracted, I'll pounce on one of them.
[126:07.18]Here's my chance right here.
[126:08.34]Got it.
[126:12.44]Clean kill on this wolf.
[126:15.20]The other one.
[126:15.66]Alright, I'm almost there.
[126:16.30]There it is.
[126:19.08]Level up!
[126:24.11]Territory of Dagenzaka is polluted.
[126:26.39]Well, that's not good.
[126:28.47]Plus 10 life.
[126:33.55]That's good.
[126:37.23]Boss failed.
[126:40.45]There's that other wolf down here.
[126:41.49]I probably should get him.
[126:42.89]Fail?
[126:43.99]What?
[126:44.63]What do you mean, fail?
[126:49.33]Failed what?
[126:54.53]Okay, the Beagle boss's failure in 16 years.
[126:56.75]I unlock the Beagle.
[126:59.83]What did I fail?
[127:00.43]Head for Shibuya Woods.
[127:04.05]Oh, okay.
[127:04.77]Well, whatever.
[127:05.23]I don't care.
[127:07.72]We still can fight Odie.
[127:11.00]That's a possibility still.
[127:15.66]Fuck, he hurts.
[127:17.32]Holy fuck, he hurts.
[127:18.86]Fight him.
[127:27.34]Go after him.
[127:29.46]He killed him!
[127:30.22]Oh, fuck!
[127:32.85]Oh, fuck!
[127:36.69]Hold on a second.
[127:41.35]Oh, this is not good.
[127:45.94]I can't fight him.
[127:47.40]He killed my fucking brother.
[127:49.76]God damn it.
[127:51.98]I gotta go.
[127:52.64]I gotta find some bitcoins.
[127:55.70]Treasure.
[127:58.85]Pet medicine.
[127:59.61]Alright, I think I can actually fight him now.
[128:02.77]Restores life.
[128:03.99]Yeah, let's use it.
[128:06.29]Alright, I gotta kill this guy.
[128:12.80]Not paying attention.
[128:18.06]God damn it!
[128:19.06]Come on!
[128:20.04]Come on, man!
[128:21.88]Really?
[128:26.59]Really?
[128:26.91]Like, seriously?
[128:29.73]Eat shit.
[128:36.05]That dodge saved my life.
[128:45.76]We're okay.
[128:46.28]I don't like this level though.
[128:48.92]One false move and I'm gonna die.
[128:50.76]I'm gonna fall into the toxic river.
[128:56.25]What is this?
[128:57.95]Why is this here?
[129:04.37]Yeah, that's for Nermal.
[129:06.81]Ow.
[129:10.62]Oh, I had to come in here to unlock everything.
[129:12.72]To capture the whole territory.
[129:14.44]That's cool.
[129:14.82]Okay.
[129:16.76]Oh, shit.
[129:18.44]We're gonna go through the whole sewer, then.
[129:20.82]Am I gonna find some sewer, like, some random sewer creature as, like, a wife?
[129:26.46]I don't wanna drink that water.
[129:27.34]Fuck that.
[129:28.34]Alright, we're gonna be smart about this, because I'm only one.
[129:30.34]I am one cat against potentially very dangerous animals.
[129:40.65]But down, what is it?
[129:41.53]What's down there?
[129:42.13]Okay, it's just like a chinchilla.
[129:49.73]It's a porcupine.
[129:53.61]Why are you so much more deadly than everybody else?
[129:59.33]I almost had it.
[129:59.85]Where'd you go?
[130:05.01]Get off my screen, I can't see!
[130:06.13]I need to eat this or I'm gonna lose!
[130:12.30]Alright, give me this porcupine.
[130:18.20]It must be a fifth generation porcupine.
[130:20.00]Alright, what's down here?
[130:22.08]Rabbits.
[130:29.66]What?
[130:35.65]Come here.
[130:36.41]Oh.
[130:37.13]Oh!
[130:38.31]My fucking nemesis.
[130:39.43]I don't think I can go in there.
[130:41.05]Is this poison?
[130:43.66]No, it's not.
[130:44.26]My fucking nemesis, the alligator.
[130:45.98]Can I sneak up on him?
[130:47.12]Oh, he's distracted.
[130:50.51]I can get him.
[130:50.87]Come on.
[130:51.15]Sneak up on him.
[130:52.65]Shit!
[130:53.93]He's distracted still.
[130:55.91]God damn it.
[130:56.67]I had it.
[130:57.05]I'm just too short.
[131:00.13]I got it.
[131:01.87]He's not dead.
[131:04.33]Wait.
[131:04.64]Wait.
[131:05.80]I'm still alive.
[131:06.36]I'm still alive.
[131:06.94]Get up, cat.
[131:07.64]Come on, Garfield.
[131:08.48]Go.
[131:12.08]Oh my god.
[131:19.02]Eat it.
[131:19.42]Eat him.
[131:20.22]Eat him and fucking chill.
[131:23.16]Holy shit.
[131:24.08]Why is the crocodile so powerful?
[131:26.46]I bit him in the neck.
[131:28.94]Oh, man.
[131:33.10]He can't get down.
[131:33.84]He's an idiot.
[131:38.54]He's freaking the fuck out.
[131:40.46]Okay, let's hide in the bush.
[131:45.92]Have I learned nothing of the Tiger versus Pomeranian in War of 73?
[131:50.68]Well, dude, the... Whatever.
[131:54.09]Don't worry, dude.
[131:54.67]I'm about to buy you.
[131:55.73]Alright.
[132:02.25]Go back to what you were doing.
[132:03.11]I still have three flags to claim here.
[132:09.46]Okay.
[132:09.88]I could... Fills the hunger gauge.
[132:11.86]Heals the stamina.
[132:12.74]I mean, like, I got food.
[132:13.94]I got, like, a can of dirty...
[132:22.95]Thanks for putting aggro over here, because now I can eat.
[132:25.37]I don't know how I'm going to be able to get up here, though.
[132:30.97]I'm going to have to run by him.
[132:33.49]He's just staring at me.
[132:34.53]I can get by him.
[132:35.03]I just have to run.
[132:39.83]Alligators are really slow.
[132:40.98]That's one thing I do know about alligators.
[132:43.96]They're very slow.
[132:46.80]Let's go.
[132:48.64]Escape the alligator.
[132:49.58]We're good.
[132:52.09]There's bunnies and shit down here.
[132:54.45]Another alligator, but it's alright.
[132:55.61]You don't have to worry about that.
[132:58.49]What is that?
[132:58.87]Why is there a golden retriever down here?
[133:01.37]Are you serious?
[133:06.13]Don't eat my food.
[133:06.83]That's mine.
[133:08.17]There's two golden retrievers down here.
[133:09.61]Where did you get this cavalry of retrievers?
[133:13.97]Oh, no.
[133:18.11]Goddammit, and I'm starving now.
[133:30.97]No, I have to make it to 39.
[133:31.99]Garfield needs to live.
[133:35.31]Oh, there's something else up here.
[133:36.91]What is it?
[133:37.35]I don't know.
[133:37.95]I don't know what that is.
[133:38.99]I'm scared.
[133:39.49]It's bunnies, I think.
[133:42.39]What?
[133:43.77]What?
[133:44.87]No!
[133:45.57]He's so... Oh, shit.
[133:48.60]A dead end.
[133:48.96]It's okay.
[133:49.78]He can't see me.
[133:50.22]And I can kill this fucking porcupine.
[133:55.13]Can I sneak up on him?
[133:56.42]Come on, give me the bite.
[133:57.46]Right here.
[133:58.54]Give it to me.
[133:59.62]Give it to me!
[134:01.34]Give it to me!
[134:02.60]Give it to me!
[134:03.78]Got it.
[134:05.76]Don't ever turn your back on fucking Garfield.
[134:12.49]Okay, I'm good.
[134:14.81]Just gotta be cautious.
[134:19.63]Alright, we're good.
[134:20.75]I think there's two more dogs up here, though.
[134:24.69]Get up there.
[134:26.89]There we go.
[134:27.41]Okay.
[134:28.87]Porcupine.
[134:29.59]Give me that free food.
[134:32.30]I will take it.
[134:32.86]I don't like how slow you go there.
[134:41.06]Come on.
[134:42.06]You dickhead.
[134:46.99]This game is a lot of fun for some reason.
[134:51.03]It's a very simple game.
[134:54.11]but something about it.
[134:55.01]I don't know what it is.
[134:56.57]It's fun to play.
[134:58.73]Still food in here.
[134:59.81]Still got time.
[135:04.06]39, right?
[135:04.26]10 more years.
[135:04.88]Alright, I gotta be... Okay.
[135:07.14]Abilities are lowered due to old age.
[135:09.00]Oh, no.
[135:10.74]I am actually getting old.
[135:13.40]I'm getting old.
[135:14.16]I have been... Holy shit, what are those?
[135:18.80]What is that thing?
[135:20.08]What are those animals?
[135:22.71]Those are like jaguars.
[135:25.11]And they're sitting right on the flag.
[135:26.75]What are those?
[135:27.51]There's just much bigger versions of me.
[135:29.15]This is unfair.
[135:29.73]I'm old.
[135:31.49]I'm an old fucking cat.
[135:33.13]How am I supposed to beat these guys?
[135:35.27]These are fucking panthers.
[135:37.85]What?
[135:41.09]Why did I just... Why did I just... Whoa!
[136:10.35]Garfield didn't make it to 39.
[136:11.79]I did unlock another piece of the story, though.
[136:19.73]Go get the fucking gator.
[136:25.64]A new story has been added.
[136:28.12]Let's go take a look at it.
[136:31.75]Act two, follow your instinct.
[136:33.73]The Pomeranian is feasting on rabbits and taking territory from cats.
[136:37.43]You've grown into a fully fledged hunter along with Pomeranian pride and uncontrollable urge has awakened.
[136:43.47]All right, can we move away from the Pomeranian?
[136:54.10]Gator, gator, gator.
[136:57.96]The gator is gonna be slow and it's gonna be a waste of like $1.50.
[137:02.78]And then I'm going to have to be right... Okay, after this, we'll be right back.
[137:05.32]And I'm going to go buy a bunch of... I'm going to go buy the dinosaur.
[137:07.66]No, that's, like, not fair.
[137:13.87]Go get a female.
[137:14.67]Like, we can't go from Pomeranian to kitty cat to dinosaur, guys.
[137:27.73]What's wrong here?
[137:28.23]There she is.
[137:37.19]Alright, we'll just follow over here.
[137:40.91]There's a pig up there.
[137:42.59]It seems this is boar territory.
[137:46.05]Oh, man.
[137:50.07]Okay, so the boars sit up there and perch like birds.
[137:53.23]That's fine.
[137:53.73]I have to go up there and fight them.
[137:59.16]Garfield is king of the jungle.
[138:00.46]He may have been.
[138:03.32]Ow.
[138:03.48]Okay, they have a charge.
[138:11.14]Okay, good to know that those, they have... Fucking boar territory.
[138:19.23]And they have a dash.
[138:22.29]That's just fantastic.
[138:24.71]Got stunlocked.
[138:28.38]Thank you Hyena Dip for the bits.
[138:30.92]Bark souls prepare to die.
[138:32.50]Pretty much.
[138:36.40]I do like the sense of urgency, though.
[138:38.42]That it's just over when you die.
[138:40.90]Makes you not want to die.
[138:45.91]Here lies Pomeranian.
[138:47.03]He never scored.
[138:49.83]Not yet.
[138:51.01]Okay, this time I'm gonna be ready for that.
[138:52.69]And by ready, I mean, like, fucking SLASH!
[139:04.65]Okay, I don't think I'm... I gotta just get out of the way here, man.
[139:11.92]Fuck these boars.
[139:16.06]I don't think I can even dodge through it, either.
[139:17.50]I think I just have to... Fuck off, man.
[139:25.47]Get out of here.
[139:26.09]I can't fight all these boars.
[139:28.49]Oh, goddammit.
[139:30.31]Oh, goddammit.
[139:31.20]I gotta go back up.
[139:42.94]Shit!
[139:44.26]Shit!
[139:45.32]Shit!
[139:46.28]This is just expletive that... Oh, come on, you fucking asshole.
[139:50.07]What?
[139:50.27]I don't understand.
[139:52.69]Like, what?
[139:53.19]What?
[139:53.57]What?
[139:58.21]I have to... I can't... God fucking damn it, man.
[140:00.86]Seriously.
[140:03.34]I have to dodge all the boars.
[140:04.60]I just got fucking... That's really irritating.
[140:09.68]Yeah, I know.
[140:11.52]Yeah, she's wagging her ass.
[140:12.74]That's great.
[140:13.22]This is boar territory.
[140:18.73]Yeah, I know.
[140:19.39]They're up.
[140:20.27]Okay, cool.
[140:22.47]Gator would have won.
[140:27.93]Fuck the story.
[140:28.79]Alright, let's hide.
[140:34.78]And sneak this way.
[140:35.77]Okay, got you.
[140:45.99]Don't just aggro everybody.
[140:47.05]Just kill them.
[140:48.71]Hide from the shadows.
[140:50.45]And lunge.
[140:53.11]There's a guy over here.
[140:55.83]He's not paying attention, I don't think.
[140:57.34]Let's see.
[140:57.78]Where is he?
[140:59.12]Other side?
[140:59.60]No, he's down.
[141:00.06]Okay.
[141:02.88]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[141:03.98]I didn't expect him to be up here that fast.
[141:07.30]Whatever, we're already up here.
[141:14.06]I'm gonna go down.
[141:15.19]Wait, I might... Jesus Christ.
[141:26.45]I gotta creep.
[141:31.15]Alright, I made it.
[141:31.55]We're good.
[141:33.15]Alright, come here.
[141:37.69]Bomber is my main.
[141:44.57]If I play as a boar, do I get that speed?
[141:54.54]Gotta get some pup- Oh, man.
[141:56.46]It's gonna show the close-up, isn't it?
[141:57.80]Nope.
[141:59.00]Okay, she doesn't- she doesn't want to be my mate.
[142:02.61]You found a mate, now head for a human apartment to seal the deal.
[142:05.71]I don't want to have sex out in the street!
[142:09.47]I'm not a fucking savage!
[142:12.27]No, we're going down this way.
[142:15.84]Wait, what?
[142:20.10]Go seal the deal.
[142:21.32]Okay.
[142:24.28]You won't have sex with me in the middle of the road.
[142:26.42]So you're actually- that's pretty- that's a pretty classy thing to say.
[142:31.03]Watch out for the fucking cats.
[142:36.23]Fight them, my love.
[142:41.17]Are you hungry?
[142:42.75]Are you hungry?
[142:43.31]Do you eat before sex?
[142:44.61]That's a bad idea.
[142:51.84]Don't eat before sex.
[142:58.20]This is serious.
[143:05.27]Up here.
[143:08.43]I'm gonna go into the apartment, the abandoned apartment.
[143:11.22]This is very, very... This is very not what I would consider a very working relationship.
[143:19.34]Hey, you gotta wait 30 minutes before you go swimming.
[143:24.13]Everybody knows that.
[143:28.33]Who doesn't know that?
[143:32.89]This guy's... Oh, what did he just do?
[143:35.42]He just called the horde?
[143:40.56]We called the horde.
[143:41.20]We gotta go.
[143:41.64]Alright, eat up and snack because we're about to get, like, bombarded by animals.
[143:46.48]Uh, where are they?
[143:49.50]Over here?
[143:51.44]Where's the apartment?
[143:52.40]Okay, I gotta go left and then up.
[143:53.70]Oh, there they are.
[143:56.14]They're walking into a wall.
[143:57.32]Thank god they're brainless.
[143:58.36]Come on, honey.
[144:02.44]Sex in an abandoned building sounds pretty good.
[144:09.16]There it is.
[144:12.24]Don't eat before sex, you'll drown.
[144:16.46]What is that?
[144:18.02]Oh no, not a fucking pig boss.
[144:21.10]What on earth?
[144:22.88]Just run by him.
[144:24.28]Don't fight this guy.
[144:25.38]Run by him!
[144:26.88]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[144:28.66]Get away from the jealous ex-boyfriend!
[144:31.49]Yeah, we're good.
[144:37.37]Oh no!
[144:39.11]I just wanted... There was my girlfriend.
[144:40.79]Right now I'm sad.
[144:42.27]That was easy.
[144:53.62]Easy enough.
[144:55.68]Let's go, honey.
[144:59.21]It's actually like a house.
[145:00.94]Yeah, so if you take a look at it, I rent this place.
[145:06.02]You know, I'm a renter.
[145:06.92]I rent this place.
[145:08.18]It's pretty nice.
[145:08.94]You see over here, we have the closet with the dirty laundry.
[145:12.89]I got Play-Doh on the floor.
[145:15.35]This is spread out green Play-Doh.
[145:18.41]And, yeah, the bed's kind of cool.
[145:20.23]If you want to take a look at the bed, just come on over here.
[145:24.84]This place is $200 a month.
[145:27.54]And that's why you sealed the deal.
[145:29.39]Come on over here.
[145:30.09]I'm a little bit hungry, but it's alright.
[145:32.67]You just come over here, sweetie.
[145:35.41]Just ignore the dead guy in the corner.
[145:40.17]It's a one bedroom, one bath.
[145:43.68]And the bathroom is in the fucking living room.
[145:51.04]I just heard a couple of barks.
[145:52.98]Five months have passed.
[145:54.22]Five months.
[145:57.17]The Pomeranian now has healthy pups.
[146:00.13]Living in their shitty fucking rundown house.
[146:04.21]Time to bring back food for their parents.
[146:12.89]What a shithole.
[146:15.91]They were just having sex for five months straight.
[146:18.99]Yep.
[146:20.53]Look at this place.
[146:21.95]Wow, it's in beautiful downtown!
[146:24.21]Come on down to the apartment!
[146:28.79]Are those rabbits gigantic or am I crazy?
[146:30.99]These rabbits are huge.
[146:40.70]Use your mouth to carry the carcass back to your parents.
[146:46.10]What?
[146:51.66]I can do this?
[146:54.40]What's the point of doing this in the survival game?
[147:01.30]Look what I brought.
[147:03.32]I brought you something- I brought you this thing to fuck.
[147:09.78]Add it to your, like, weird sexual fantasies, mom and dad.
[147:12.92]That was uncalled for, I'm sorry.
[147:19.70]This is supposed to be a family stream.
[147:24.14]Wait, what?
[147:25.24]Your parents don't seem pleased with the food you brought back.
[147:28.46]Find some food that satisfies your parents.
[147:34.62]Well then fine, I'm gonna eat it.
[147:41.58]Not pleased.
[147:50.93]Eat- That wasn't- Oh, here, they want chicken.
[147:54.77]They want a chicken dinner.
[147:58.09]I would too, actually, if I'm honest.
[148:00.71]Rabbit?
[148:01.05]I'm not a rabbit fan.
[148:02.13]Oh, no.
[148:04.30]Oh no!
[148:07.06]There's a pack of kitties!
[148:12.40]Two cats and two fat cats.
[148:16.60]Got one.
[148:19.70]Come on, get me.
[148:20.46]Give me the crosshair.
[148:23.20]Alright, my brother's useless.
[148:25.42]Shit.
[148:31.24]Come on.
[148:34.11]Oh, you little dick.
[148:34.95]Come here.
[148:38.03]I'm like tiny.
[148:40.29]I'm like losing track of him on the screen.
[148:48.07]Got that one.
[148:48.55]Nice.
[148:48.83]Okay.
[148:49.24]Only one more.
[148:49.76]Just the big one.
[148:50.48]He's eating his own fucking brother.
[148:53.04]He's just sitting there eating him.
[148:55.28]I had an opportunity to kill him while he ate his fucking family.
[148:59.08]That was really fucking messed up.
[149:06.79]Go get him.
[149:09.07]Attack.
[149:11.95]Attack him.
[149:17.21]Get him.
[149:18.27]Will you do something?
[149:19.92]Thank you.
[149:22.88]I'm gonna lose.
[149:23.44]I'm gonna lose stamina.
[149:30.18]I love how I have to hold triangle for him to do anything.
[149:34.45]Got it.
[149:34.79]Okay.
[149:35.15]Thank God.
[149:36.75]And now I'm gonna bring this back.
[149:43.67]Your dog brother is a moron.
[149:51.12]I have a dog brother that won't do what I want him to do.
[149:53.26]And we're gonna both drag him.
[149:54.32]This is fucking morbid.
[150:05.46]There it is.
[150:12.93]You were once a human pampered Pomeranian, but you can now support a family of your own.
[150:18.68]Your pups continue to grow strong day by day.
[150:23.61]Looks like the Pomeranians may actually be able to survive in this savage new world.
[150:28.53]They're eating like a rotten cat.
[150:31.23]Oh yeah, they're sure able to survive consuming like a fucking four day old rotting cat carcass.
[150:36.85]What a great life.
[150:39.23]That's the American dream.
[150:46.17]That was a KFC family bucket.
[150:51.38]Alright, well there we go.
[150:52.84]Survival.
[150:55.86]We're gonna do one... What do we got?
[150:58.24]Do we have any more unlocks?
[151:01.30]No.
[151:01.46]We're gonna do cat again.
[151:02.38]I feel like I got robbed of my cat fun.
[151:07.92]Gator... No, gate... We're gonna end... Ugh.
[151:14.18]Be right back.
[151:15.42]Give me a second.
[151:16.10]This is gonna take a second.
[151:17.12]Hold on.
[151:19.05]Be right...
[152:16.25]Can't believe I'm fucking buying the gator.
[152:18.01]I'm buying the gator and like the kangaroo.
[152:22.13]Hold on.
[152:38.91]I haven't turned on this PlayStation 3 in so long I have to redo my internet settings.
[152:44.94]It's been like three years since I've used this PlayStation 3.
[152:51.37]Hold on a second.
[152:53.95]You guys wanted this.
[152:54.65]This is gonna take... This is gonna take a little while.
[152:58.05]This is gonna take like ten minutes.
[153:17.66]Hold on.
[153:22.12]It's going to kick me out because it's going to want to do a PlayStation 3 update.
[153:26.00]All this for a fucking alligator that I'm going to lose with in 10 minutes.
[153:36.19]Office worker or riot.
[153:38.25]What are you guys talking about?
[153:42.18]There's an office worker?
[153:47.13]There's a person?
[153:47.75]You can actually unlock a person.
[153:51.23]What?
[153:54.39]You can play as a human?
[153:57.09]That doesn't make any sense.
[153:57.75]There's an office worker DLC.
[154:03.85]That is... There's a system software update that's required.
[154:08.56]I knew this was going to happen.
[154:11.54]I knew it.
[154:12.24]Let me just double check.
[154:17.58]I do.
[154:17.80]I haven't connected to PlayStation 3 in three years.
[154:20.32]Of course it's going to make me download an update.
[154:27.44]I don't know.
[154:28.30]It's worth it.
[154:34.97]Okay, there's update data.
[154:36.63]Sure thing.
[154:37.17]Download the update.
[154:38.49]Go for it.
[154:40.71]You guys want to look at it?
[154:41.61]Take a look.
[154:43.55]No, actually the console just turned off.
[154:47.90]Huh.
[154:48.44]Okay.
[154:50.44]Uh, additional functions.
[154:51.28]You can now use remote play.
[154:52.72]Oh, that's fucking great.
[154:55.40]And now there's even an update for Tokyo Jungle that I didn't have.
[155:08.03]I didn't know I was going to have to connect to the internet for this shit.
[155:10.05]I don't even have PlayStation Now.
[155:11.41]Well, you don't need PlayStation Now on old PlayStation 3.
[155:13.49]This is back when game companies weren't awful.
[155:16.92]No, you did.
[155:17.90]You did, didn't you?
[155:18.66]You did.
[155:21.58]Is this back when PlayStation 3 didn't... PlayStation 3 needed you to buy it, right?
[155:31.84]My memory is so jagged.
[155:39.02]Gator was the DLC.
[155:41.92]Turn on the face cam while we wait.
[155:43.20]I don't know if the face cam is plugged in.
[155:45.96]I could do that.
[155:48.00]PlayStation 3 didn't need money.
[155:49.28]Okay, PlayStation 3 was the one that didn't need money.
[155:52.00]Okay.
[155:54.72]So this is back in the golden age of like PlayStation 3 was free to use online.
[155:58.41]It didn't have to have like a $30 a year, like $50 a year subscription or something, right?
[156:05.11]God, remember those golden years?
[156:08.88]Remember the golden age of video games when I didn't have to pay money to play my video game?
[156:13.84]Alright, let me go to the store.
[156:18.53]Let me see if this is going to work now.
[156:21.29]Okay.
[156:21.85]Wait.
[156:22.09]I can buy shit.
[156:23.01]I'll purchase headwear.
[156:24.17]No, I have to unlock these first.
[156:28.13]Okay.
[156:28.41]Well, hold on.
[156:28.95]I told you this was going to take a few minutes.
[156:35.65]New game.
[156:36.75]Single player.
[156:39.88]Fucking alligator.
[156:40.78]All right.
[156:42.78]Let's get the alligator.
[156:45.94]All right.
[156:49.91]Hold on.
[156:51.83]A system software update is required.
[156:56.67]Okay, just give me a sec.
[156:58.17]I gotta turn on the webcam.
[156:59.51]Because we have like at least 20 minutes before we can do this.
[157:04.93]I gotta do a system update.
[157:06.55]How do I do this shit?
[157:09.35]Where's the software update for this PlayStation 3 system update?
[157:14.93]Yeah, go ahead and do it.
[157:16.15]Let's turn on the fucking webcam.
[157:17.49]You guys can look at my ugly fucking mutated face for like 10 minutes.
[157:24.81]You guys can look at my like mutated ugly fucking face for like 10 minutes.
[157:32.04]You can take a look at some of the other games.
[157:33.30]I got like 35 PlayStation 3 games.
[157:35.24]You guys understand that?
[157:38.87]Alright, let me move this.
[157:42.27]The latest update was found.
[157:44.08]Watch this fuck up my whole game.
[157:45.22]I would cry.
[157:48.48]Yeah, accept the user license agreement.
[157:50.84]Go ahead and spy on me.
[157:54.22]Okay, Sony, yes, I give you the rights to look at what websites I go to and come find me.
[158:03.47]Video capture device.
[158:06.03]Alright, let me open this up.
[158:10.80]There it is.
[158:12.93]Is it there?
[158:13.57]Can you see it?
[158:15.31]No, it's not there.
[158:16.43]It ain't working.
[158:16.99]Hold on.
[158:20.91]Configure it.
[158:22.31]I might have to plug it in.
[158:23.25]I might have to take it out and plug it in.
[158:24.41]I'm going to have to plug it out and plug it in.
[158:28.55]Alright, we plugged it out and we plugged it in.
[158:37.43]It didn't do anything.
[158:39.47]Oh, what a... And all this is for a fucking alligator, by the way.
[158:43.95]And now I crashed OBS.
[158:46.83]OBS just fucking crashed.
[158:49.73]God damn it.
[158:52.05]And I can't even change the scene back.
[158:57.17]Wait a minute, what if I fucking rip the goddamn cord out?
[159:01.47]Okay, no.
[159:02.35]Come on, you piece of shit.
[159:10.50]My OBS is not responding because I fucking plugged in my webcam.
[159:15.68]I can't even change the scene back to the video game.
[159:18.19]I have to restart the stream.
[159:22.19]What a fucking crocodile shit.
[159:24.99]I'll be right fucking back.
[159:27.03]Oh, this is obnoxious.
[159:31.12]Give me a fucking... Goddamn fucking alligator.
[159:38.53]I'm not even synced.
[159:39.57]I'm not even in sync.
[159:44.55]Hit the refresh button.
[159:55.36]I just gained 100 viewers.
[160:00.41]How did I gain 100 fucking people?
[160:03.02]We're at 99%.
[160:03.36]I can't believe I'm actually doing this.
[160:06.62]All this to get a fucking alligator.
[160:14.06]All this for an alligator.
[160:15.68]Remember, this is just to unlock the alligator.
[160:23.28]Look, this is what I'm looking at right now.
[160:26.76]There's not even a goddamn signal.
[160:30.32]Not even a signal.
[160:31.94]Where's the signal?
[160:35.13]What are you talking about?
[160:38.57]No signal.
[160:41.61]This is for an alligator.
[160:43.03]I hope you guys are happy.
[160:56.92]Oh, God.
[160:57.58]Alright, get the fuck over here.
[161:10.63]There we go.
[161:11.27]Okay.
[161:12.21]How out of sync is my microphone, by the way?
[161:14.89]You probably should be like hearing me and like seeing me like within like 10 seconds late.
[161:21.64]And now it's doing this shit.
[161:26.78]We're back.
[161:28.02]We're back.
[161:29.06]We're back.
[161:30.21]I only lost like 2,000 viewers.
[161:32.31]This is not a big deal.
[161:33.49]Don't worry.
[161:35.83]We only lost 2,000 people.
[161:50.33]Oh, it was worth it.
[161:51.05]Yeah, it was worth it to lose 2,000 people so we could get a fucking dumb alligator on stream.
[162:05.09]This is fucking a huge fucking update.
[162:07.97]God damn it.
[162:16.52]Any fucked up shit behind me over here?
[162:24.87]This is gonna take like 20, I knew it, I told you guys.
[162:28.89]I fucking told you guys that it was not worth it, because I hadn't turned my PlayStation 3 on in three years.
[162:36.08]So now we gotta deal with this shit.
[162:38.88]I haven't turned on my PlayStation 3 in three years.
[162:42.18]So we have to sit here for an update now, because you guys so badly wanted me to buy an alligator from the fucking in-game store.
[162:48.68]We could have unlocked a fucking pig, that would have taken only like another 20 or 30 minutes.
[162:54.78]Instead, we're sitting here.
[162:55.64]And a thousand fucking people left.
[162:59.86]More than that.
[163:01.64]God damn it.
[163:06.70]Fucking alligator.
[163:15.30]Please re-sync.
[163:16.52]I was not part of the alligator crew.
[163:21.49]Hold on a second.
[163:22.01]We're going to fucking play with some tape while we wait for this to be done.
[163:26.67]And I have to go get my credit card.
[163:28.15]What a waste of fucking time.
[163:32.21]What a fucking waste of time.
[163:38.70]I have to like punch in my credit card and shit.
[163:43.04]You know, fuck you guys.
[163:43.98]I'm going to unlock the pig.
[163:45.22]I'm going to buy the pig.
[163:46.64]And we're going to play with the pig.
[163:52.88]What'd I eat for dinner?
[163:53.62]Uh, hold on.
[163:54.08]I'm trying to get this tape to come out.
[163:59.67]Now the tape don't... Now the tape is all fucked up.
[164:01.75]And I fucked up the tape too.
[164:02.75]Look at this.
[164:03.55]You know when you bunch up tape like this and it just... You can't... It's just never gonna come off because you took too many pieces off the... Look at this.
[164:17.10]This is what I gotta deal with.
[164:19.04]This is the shit I gotta deal with.
[164:20.46]Look at that.
[164:21.06]Who did that?
[164:21.88]I didn't do it.
[164:28.33]Can't even do my terrible tape joke that I was going to do.
[164:30.43]Oh, no.
[164:30.67]Yeah, I can.
[164:31.03]Here we go.
[164:31.31]Is it going to hurt?
[164:35.99]670%.
[164:41.93]All right.
[164:42.31]Oh, my.
[164:42.45]I'm seeing stars.
[164:56.28]I'm actually like, I'm like the world is blinking in front of me.
[165:06.49]I gotta create my wallet.
[165:11.13]1000 viewers.
[165:13.25]Good stream.
[165:14.71]We watch a fucking bar.
[165:17.46]We were going so good too.
[165:21.35]The audio has to lag behind because it's going through a capture card.
[165:24.92]Okay.
[165:25.76]There we go.
[165:27.38]Let's see.
[165:28.56]Let's take a look.
[165:29.54]Now we just have to get my credit card.
[165:30.84]And then I have to buy the alligator and then buy the human apparently.
[165:33.48]I gotta buy a human.
[165:35.49]Okay.
[165:38.85]Easy.
[165:39.71]Easy like bright blue Ivan fucking ooze screen.
[165:47.54]I gotta get my fucking credit card.
[165:50.12]Tell your friends to come back.
[165:51.56]To the screen.

[166:16.86]And we gotta buy.
[166:18.50]Some shit.
[166:19.00]What if my, like, credit card is stored on here from, like, five years ago?

[167:12.25]None of those have gators in them, though, unfortunately.
[167:20.60]Vitagoga is a terrible game.
[167:25.94]God damn it.
[167:26.62]Look, I got a user license agreement now?
[167:28.50]I didn't have this before.
[167:29.72]Do I want to cancel?
[167:30.54]No.
[167:30.84]I accept your stupid agreement.
[167:33.24]This is why you don't connect your PlayStation device to the internet.
[167:36.78]That's how they get you.
[167:38.58]That's how they know where you are.
[167:40.70]Now they know where I am.

[172:20.97]No credit cards.
[172:21.75]Like, who cares about the fucking alligator?
[172:23.63]I had the cat unlocked.
[172:26.06]And it's all, it's frozen.
[172:28.40]Is it?
[172:34.00]Using a goddamn fucking credit card.
[172:38.20]And using an old infrastructure from like 2006.
[172:41.16]Alright, add funds.
[172:45.99]Right, where is it?
[172:48.67]Payment method.

[173:33.87]I'm sorry.
[173:34.21]I don't know what my PlayStation fucking free password is.
[173:39.00]We can't unlock the alligator.
[173:40.16]It's not going to happen.
[173:42.84]How do I forget my password on a console I haven't used in years?
[173:46.75]I don't fucking know, dude, because every password I have is different.
[173:56.54]Reset password?
[173:57.36]No, I'm streaming a game right now.
[173:59.46]We're not gonna go, like, reset my password and, like, fucking put a credit card on.
[174:03.74]No, if I'm gonna play this again, we'll play the next time with an alligator.
[174:10.53]It's the PS4 one.
[174:12.15]I don't even know what that is.
[174:15.67]We fucking, we had a stream going.
[174:17.91]And like, of course, I have to stop the fucking stream to do something that I shouldn't have even done in the first place.
[174:33.36]All this was for nothing.
[174:41.26]I have to do.
[174:45.16]All right.
[174:45.70]All right.
[174:46.04]All right.
[174:46.36]Fine.
[174:47.30]Fine.
[174:47.86]Fine.
[174:48.33]I'm sorry.
[174:48.83]Those of you guys that have been waiting that you were like waiting for me to play the fucking game, but I'm going to go get my password.
[174:54.01]I'm going to buy the fucking alligator and then I'm going to scream the whole rest of the stream.
[174:57.71]I'll be back.
[174:58.19]I'm going to actually be right back for real.
[174:59.70]Be right back.
[177:18.72]Good thing my camera wasn't on because my pants just fell off.
[177:20.98]Like, I don't have any underwear on.
[177:22.80]So, like, that's what happened.
[177:26.04]That is just what happened.
[177:28.38]So, if the webcam had just been on right now, naked, like, literal naked, and I would have been banned from Twitch TV forever.
[177:36.17]So, like, I hope you guys are getting what you want.
[177:40.85]Literally fucking banned forever from Twitch TV almost.
[177:43.39]You almost just saw my full-on, full-frontal naked body.

[178:28.65]We've got to go down a bunch of fucking roads.
[178:35.69]Is it an emote-only mode?
[178:39.74]Might as well be.
[178:46.50]Let's get in.

[186:41.24]Why can't I just punch in my credit card and buy it?
[186:45.16]Why do I have to store a credit card on file with PlayStation?
[186:49.32]Can't I just buy the fucking thing?
[186:53.20]Can't I just purchase the thing?

[191:08.59]I'm going to beat that fucking Beagle boss this time.
[191:10.41]You better believe it.
[191:13.63]There's nothing wrong with Just Cause 2.
[191:15.19]Just Cause 2 is not a shit.

[191:26.56]Oh no, where is the Beagle?
[191:30.52]They gave LittleBigPlanet 2 for free after they got hacked.
[191:33.62]Oh, cool.
[191:37.24]How about the pain and suffering of having all of my information given to somebody?
[191:42.18]LittleBigPlanet 2 is a fun game.
[191:43.84]You can create anything.
[191:45.02]You can create Super Mario level.
[191:51.00]So he's in the Shibuya suburbs.
[191:52.72]Actually, we're on the right way.
[191:53.94]We're on the right path.
[192:04.64]So I didn't expect look I didn't expect this stream to turn into this okay I was having fun playing Tokyo jungle and then we so desperately had to get the fucking alligator and then of course I have ran into a credit card problems and Like 25 and turn stream off.
[192:20.72]It's bad look.

[192:23.40]Oh
[192:34.12]Fuck the streamer hates on every video game ever made.
[192:37.40]That's not true.
[192:39.80]I'm just a realist, okay?
[192:42.61]I'm all about the realism.
[192:43.69]I'm all about realist.
[192:45.19]I'm a realist.
[192:47.41]And I know that's a really weird hipster fucking dumb thing to say.
[192:49.75]Like, oh, I'm a realist.
[192:51.97]Shut up.
[192:53.33]No, you're not.
[192:54.05]But I am.
[192:55.60]I'm just being real.
[192:56.54]I'm not going to fucking put candy on the things that I say.
[193:00.64]Why would I do that?
[193:04.37]I'm not gonna put candy on the shit that I say.
[193:06.23]If I fucking feel a certain way, you're gonna hear it.
[193:07.85]There's no candy on there.
[193:10.77]We're doing without the fucking shell.
[193:11.99]It's just chocolate, and it gets messy all over your hands.
[193:22.22]Where's the realism?
[193:29.26]Did someone say candy?
[193:32.94]No, if I'm a... Chill, Jesus Christ.
[193:38.41]We're talking about candy, man.
[193:43.13]Ah, I got that flag.
[193:48.82]It's called a sugar coating.
[193:50.52]I know what it is.
[193:51.24]And I don't have it.
[193:55.35]Not gonna get it from me.
[194:02.20]I have a DDR.
[194:02.96]It is a DDR.
[194:03.66]That's a good pickup.
[194:04.34]That's a DDR arrow.
[194:05.62]You're right.
[194:05.95]I'm gonna kill this Beagle boss and I'm gonna redeem myself.
[194:16.21]And we're gonna unlock the pig.
[194:18.05]And I'm gonna beat the game as the pig.
[194:20.27]You understand?
[194:22.04]Look, I'm a fucking realist, alright?
[194:32.01]Stop putting candy on your words and be honest.
[194:35.34]That's what I'm talking about.
[194:42.06]I have to beat the game with a DDR pad.
[194:45.58]That'd be very hard.
[194:47.41]Didn't somebody just recently do that with Dark Souls?
[194:51.01]Internet posting.
[194:51.71]The internet existed back here?
[194:58.25]Play as Gator Kappa.
[195:00.92]God, I wish I could.
[195:02.26]And after all that, and you guys know I'm trying, right?
[195:05.80]You guys know I'm trying.
[195:07.96]I wouldn't have done all that if I, like, you know, I'm trying.
[195:12.06]I just wanted to try, okay?
[195:14.10]And now watch me rip this fucking sheep's throat out.
[195:17.67]Maybe it'll make you feel better.
[195:24.17]Not enough effort.
[195:27.19]Come here, you little shit.
[195:32.38]Try harder.
[195:36.20]Call Jeremy.
[195:36.88]He's trying.
[195:37.60]Am I going to PAX West?
[195:44.48]I am not going to PAX West.
[195:48.49]The next event that I will be at is TwitchCon.
[195:55.17]I'm going to TwitchCon all three days.
[195:56.97]Or all two days.
[195:57.51]Whatever it is.
[195:58.95]If you're going to TwitchCon, I probably will see you there.
[196:03.42]We're gonna exchange words.
[196:04.56]We're gonna exchange information.
[196:13.25]We're trying.
[196:14.05]Streamer tries on stream.
[196:15.37]Gotta get this.
[196:20.87]And where's the, um... Beagle boss?
[196:24.25]It's right at the... Okay, to the left.
[196:26.83]I got really lucky, actually.
[196:30.39]Oops.
[196:33.92]See you at TwitchCon.
[196:34.82]Yeah, it'll be my first TwitchCon.
[196:39.74]I've never been.
[196:40.28]Yeah, this is the character I want to play as, the pig.
[196:52.42]I bet other streamers have alligators.
[196:55.34]No, that's not true.
[196:58.50]Don't make me feel bad.
[197:01.56]Somebody just give me a PSN code at TwitchCon.
[197:08.01]Does the game have frogs?
[197:09.19]Um... I actually don't know.
[197:12.05]It might.
[197:21.15]I tried to buy it.
[197:22.41]He saw me do it.
[197:23.53]He watched it in real time.
[197:26.55]Online video game stores are terrible.
[197:28.27]And there's an ad now.
[197:31.93]I got Act 3.
[197:32.37]Here we go.
[197:40.78]Claimed it.
[197:41.96]Uh, is that a wolf or a... What is that?
[197:44.50]Hey, that's my wife!
[197:45.16]Well, not yet.
[197:47.42]That's like... Okay, so now she has to be like in love with me, right?
[197:52.13]I just saved her.
[197:55.49]Didn't I get like a t-shirt or something weird?
[197:56.99]What?
[198:01.09]Vinny had an alligator?
[198:04.29]Well, what would I do?
[198:09.07]I can't go back in time and buy an alligator.
[198:11.23]Even if I did.
[198:13.49]Even if I went back in time and bought an alligator, it wouldn't happen.
[198:21.59]Give stamina jerky to the wife.
[198:26.39]I got cat clothes.
[198:27.37]I want to put them on.
[198:33.14]Let's mate.
[198:39.30]We could have left to go in.
[198:40.86]Dude, I'm not going down that road again.
[198:46.03]You guys are going to... In the next room, I'm going to turn my webcam on.
[198:48.21]There's going to be a real alligator in my room.
[198:54.99]It's just going to be hissing at me and shit.
[198:56.71]It's going to be terrifying.
[199:02.88]I wonder how much an alligator is.
[199:05.16]Can you buy an alligator?
[199:11.59]Just like the snake.
[199:12.33]We got four buddies here.
[199:15.03]And I want to put funny clothes on this one.
[199:18.62]Where's my items?

[199:55.02]A lot of chickens.
[200:02.82]Clean kill.
[200:03.96]Eat it.
[200:05.96]I want to get to boss level before I beat the Beagle though.
[200:09.34]I ain't fucking around on this Beagle boss.
[200:13.56]I do have four friends, but I want to be prepared.
[200:19.50]So we're going to get to boss.
[200:25.66]Come here.

[200:27.50]Get over here.
[200:30.02]Now this shit is toxic.
[200:31.22]Come on, really?
[200:37.79]Fuck that Beagle.
[200:38.51]I'm gonna fuck that Beagle up.
[200:39.79]Big time.
[200:46.63]Survived 13 years.
[200:52.21]That was a good reaction.
[200:53.41]Good reaction time.
[200:56.87]I thought I died.
[200:57.48]I was like, how the fuck did that?
[200:58.54]Okay, veteran.
[201:00.70]1400 calories, and we get to be... what we're looking for.
[201:05.32]Toxicity is going up.
[201:06.31]That is not good.
[201:07.07]Come on, hurry up and get there.
[201:07.97]Wait, chicken.
[201:09.43]Oh, fuck the chicken.
[201:15.46]We'll eat this one.
[201:21.39]Thank Garfield for his service.
[201:22.69]I'm so... I'm so sad that, like, I went through all that trouble, and I couldn't even get the alligator.
[201:32.88]I wanted it so bad, and I was gonna do a joke.
[201:35.00]You guys didn't even get to see the joke I was gonna do.
[201:37.62]I was gonna buy the alligator.
[201:38.84]Oh, here comes the alligator.
[201:39.74]And it was just gonna be the giraffe.
[201:41.66]I wasn't even gonna buy the alligator.
[201:43.06]I was gonna buy the giraffe, and everyone would've fucking been like, oh, what the fuck, and it would've been funny for me.
[201:48.74]And I was gonna play the game as the giraffe.
[201:51.62]Man, it's ruined.
[201:52.35]Can't do that now.
[201:56.93]Wouldn't that have been like a funny joke?
[201:58.37]That would have been like a funny thing.
[202:00.43]Would have been a 99 cent prank.
[202:06.62]Sad, I know.
[202:10.94]Where's the Beagle boss?
[202:12.10]Here somewhere.
[202:15.18]Not going to get away.
[202:18.29]So where's the joke?
[202:20.55]I mean, there ain't one right now.
[202:22.83]I think this is the beagle over here.
[202:27.27]I hope it's not, but it probably is because he's just hanging out down here.
[202:35.60]We can see the giraffe on the purchase screen.
[202:39.08]Well, that was just to make sure I proved that I wasn't insane.
[202:44.32]I think I actually can't go this way.
[202:49.43]I gotta go up.
[202:51.57]Okay, I gotta go around Snake around kill this chicken I'm gonna have to have like a new command in the chat.
[203:02.95]That's like fucking exclamation point alligator It's like Jeremy tried to buy the alligator, but it didn't work He has to wait a day for his PlayStation 3 account and I'll be like suspended Whatever the hell is wrong
[203:17.65]Please wait while we get hacked again.
[203:19.15]That's what it should have fucking said.
[203:27.99]Please wait while your card is the first one we give to the fucking criminals.
[203:31.83]Thank you for loading it on the screen.
[203:38.98]Shit.
[203:39.48]Let's get away from the turn this way.
[203:46.71]You are, like, tough for some reason.
[203:52.05]Alright, here we go.
[203:52.61]Rank up.
[203:53.05]I'm a boss.
[203:54.19]I am a boss now.
[203:55.05]Now I can take him.
[203:59.77]Put a countdown on the screen for, like, time until alligator punches.
[204:05.19]I don't know.
[204:05.55]That actually is, like, that's making me laugh.
[204:08.21]Does that have, like, a fucking sus command for, like, countdown to alligator?
[204:16.71]And watch the countdown get to the end.
[204:19.23]It doesn't even work, it says the same thing.
[204:27.69]I think I can take him.
[204:32.15]Pretty sure I can take this guy.
[204:33.37]He's around here somewhere.
[204:36.03]That's a chicken.
[204:41.01]I'm gonna see if I can set that up.
[204:42.62]So what, it was like an hour ago, right?
[204:46.31]So it would be like 23 hours from right now.
[204:52.20]You know what, guys?
[204:52.74]I might, like, I'm not supposed to stream tomorrow, but I might just turn the fucking stream on tomorrow night just to show you that I bought, like, me buying the alligator and, like, putting him in the game.
[205:01.86]The stream's gonna be, like, 20 minutes long.
[205:15.48]I need to prove it to myself.
[205:21.49]Looks like this might be him.
[205:24.65]No?
[205:29.41]We're still eating.
[205:31.91]Who the fuck is this guy?
[205:35.91]What was my highest score?
[205:36.71]Like 50,000 points in like 30 years?
[205:42.93]I'm going to stream me buying the content.
[205:46.96]That's it.
[205:49.56]You predict Jerma can purchase an alligator in 26 minutes.
[205:53.68]What?
[205:57.61]26 minutes?
[205:58.05]Oh, God.
[206:00.17]That's not true.
[206:01.09]There you go, boys and girls.
[206:04.35]26 minutes.
[206:05.19]You've seen it.
[206:05.65]It's on the clock.
[206:08.65]That's so funny.
[206:12.48]Alright, this cat is getting old.
[206:13.72]I need to procreate.
[206:17.09]Like, very soon.
[206:18.19]Otherwise, he's going to lose stats.
[206:21.91]I got the date wrong.
[206:29.71]Alright.
[206:31.11]How many more flags?
[206:36.33]Where is he?
[206:37.47]My old cat needs to seriously get the ball here.
[206:41.54]Get the ball rolling.
[206:44.16]Large pack over here.
[206:46.70]Of what exactly?
[206:47.60]Beagle boss?
[206:51.29]Just a bunch of chickens.
[206:54.45]We need to find the beagle.
[206:59.15]Oh, wait a minute.
[206:59.51]Do I only have like one half year to find him?
[207:04.64]I think I only have another half year to find him.
[207:08.48]We gotta find him quickly.
[207:13.62]Meow.
[207:15.25]Shit.
[207:17.35]This ain't even the right way, though.
[207:22.53]Okay.
[207:23.63]Two more flags.
[207:31.67]The boss is up at the nest.
[207:32.97]Okay.

[207:41.13]Okay.
[207:46.33]Uh, where is he?
[207:50.55]Looking for the Beagle boss.
[207:56.40]I'd like to find him.
[208:01.34]No Beagle.
[208:01.90]Where the fuck is he?
[208:03.10]Okay, where's this Beagle?
[208:14.50]Defeat the Beagle boss in Shibuya suburbs.
[208:20.41]And that's how you unlock the Beagle.
[208:25.03]There he is.
[208:30.67]Okay.
[208:31.57]Well, he was real hard.
[208:35.80]We now have the Beagle.
[208:36.64]That guy didn't even pay attention to me.
[208:42.74]That was a hard boss.
[208:45.52]Alright, I got the pickings, right?
[208:50.10]Why did everybody just disappear?
[208:50.98]Alright, this is a pristine cat.
[208:52.60]This is gonna be great, kids.

[210:19.84]Did they kill everyone?
[210:21.14]That was going so well.
[210:24.42]I was a fucking boss.
[210:31.60]And you're telling me that with four fucking cats, I can't fight two fucking wolves.
[210:39.04]What a crock of shit.
[210:41.80]Playing as a fucking beagle.
[210:42.84]A cat sucks.
[210:43.62]Fuck the goddamn cat.
[210:45.02]Never playing as a fucking cat again.

[211:05.47]I don't care about where I am on the leaderboards.

[211:14.06]There he is.
[211:25.30]We do have six generation Pomeranians, though.

[212:55.87]My new slow animal.
[212:57.05]I'm just the Dead Sea.
[213:03.87]I did just kill a beagle.
[213:05.44]It's every man for himself, apparently, until you decide to have a mate.
[213:11.36]Speaking of... Is that two Pomeranians up here?
[213:14.82]Because that's what, like, they were last time.
[213:16.25]No, two chickens.
[213:18.53]Alright, this time, no fucking around.
[213:24.77]I'm gonna actually try to get, like, to, like... I wanna try to get to, like, 50 years with the beagles.

[213:33.88]Yes, I did.
[213:35.04]Very fun game.
[213:38.34]Red Faction Guerrilla is a very, very good game.
[213:41.60]A lot of fun.
[213:42.62]Highly recommend.
[213:51.55]Tokyo Jungle is unfortunately only for PS3.
[214:00.31]Everybody's gonna be mad at me.
[214:01.55]Like, am I not supposed to be killing my own?
[214:04.33]Won't they attack me?
[214:06.01]Who knows?
[214:09.85]I feel like the dogs, the beagles lunge this farther.
[214:16.29]Go play gun instead.
[214:17.73]I mean, I'm having fun playing this.
[214:18.95]This is a fun game.
[214:28.77]Somebody buy me an alligator.
[214:34.43]I bought the alligator DLC only to find that you can't gift DLC.
[214:39.52]Oh, God.
[214:42.50]You don't have to buy me it.
[214:43.82]Like, don't... Somebody... You can't... Oh, man.
[214:54.20]Alright, we're just gonna get married.

[215:00.00]I feel bad now.
[215:02.34]Should have bought the office worker.
[215:03.55]I wish I could buy anything.
[215:11.03]Buy him a PSN code.
[215:15.31]No, you don't have to buy me a PSN code, guys.
[215:17.87]Don't worry.
[215:22.15]This dog has fleas.
[215:23.81]I no longer have fleas.
[215:24.79]I went in the water and washed them up.
[215:32.51]I can't even play gun, because I didn't save the fucking game.
[215:42.64]Well, they cut that one early.
[215:43.66]Alright, new generation, happy birthday, beagle 2.
[215:49.58]Got two beagles.
[215:51.10]I've earned a trophy, pedigree.
[215:54.06]Whatever that means.
[215:54.70]Plus 5 stamina.
[215:58.14]And I want to go left.

[216:13.79]I want to milk the alligator command.
[216:20.13]But, yeah.
[216:21.27]Don't worry about me.
[216:23.33]I've had fun.
[216:23.77]This has been like a fun stream.
[216:24.72]Like, this is a fun game.
[216:26.70]I've enjoyed this stream.
[216:27.86]I wish, unfortunately, we didn't have to deal with all the dumb shit.
[216:32.42]Trying to buy an alligator skin.
[216:37.73]But sadly, that's just the way it is.
[216:46.33]Am I gonna do a bald stream in 2018?
[216:47.73]Wait, you're talking about that I'm gonna be bald in 2018?
[216:50.25]You think I'm gonna be a bald motherfucker in fucking, like, next year?
[216:55.42]It's not gonna happen.
[216:57.06]Way sooner than that.

[217:06.52]Or was that last time?
[217:14.95]Easy just gonna make it quick kill the pig is we hungry I Think there's a lesson to be learned you don't need to pay to win to be good you don't get special cats You don't need special giraffe.
[217:32.86]You just need a good old reliable beagle that is earned through hard work That's a good statement beowulf Absolutely, I 100% agree
[217:43.27]The beagle's gonna take us to the end.

[217:56.41]You don't fucking know who you're talking to?
[217:57.75]What the hell was that?
[218:03.04]Did you just fight back?
[218:08.02]That sounds like something someone without an alligator would say.
[218:16.59]You are right, it's true, because I don't have an alligator.
[218:21.40]Look, I don't need the alligator crutch.
[218:23.06]I can beat the game without the alligator.
[218:30.06]This is a level up.
[218:32.62]If you guys don't think I have the patience and the confidence to beat this game with the beagle, then I don't know who you think I am.
[218:42.16]You know I beat a certain game on stream?
[218:47.26]I don't even need to tell you what it was.
[218:48.34]Like do I need to fucking tell you guys this shit?
[218:55.19]Look.
[219:04.62]Look.
[219:17.13]talk about this shit like do you idiots know like what I'm talking about here I don't know how I don't know how how stupid you guys can possibly be to not know that I beat fuck Dark Souls 3 on this fuck god dick stream okay every single fuck one of you

[220:13.72]Wait, you guys can't hear the beep?
[220:16.24]What?
[220:19.65]you guys can't wait hold on a second you guys couldn't hear the beep on stream oh is the music too loud the beep is way too quiet
[220:49.23]You guys couldn't hear the beep?
[220:52.31]Did I ruin it?
[220:53.37]Oh, wait.
[220:59.52]Somebody clip it.
[221:00.20]I want to hear it.
[221:04.00]I just sounded like I had bad reception.
[221:07.02]What?
[221:14.65]What?
[221:16.39]You guys can't hear that?
[221:21.70]You gotta be kidding me.
[221:32.25]Now you idiots can hear it.
[221:35.05]Of course.
[221:37.09]Everyone, you dumb motherfucker.
[221:42.37]Oh, wow.
[221:42.76]I look real stupid, huh?
[221:46.36]That's unfortunate.
[221:48.08]Oh, well.
[221:51.30]And the timing is off because... Hold on a minute.
[221:52.98]Let me... It's desynced.
[221:56.46]The microphone is desynced.
[221:57.92]So it doesn't even matter what I'm doing right now.
[222:00.26]That would have been fucking pretty funny.
[222:02.16]The beep is way earlier than the square because I had to bring my microphone to 650 milliseconds.
[222:07.92]Slower.
[222:09.00]So it could sync up to the PlayStation 3.
[222:11.12]Well, okay.
[222:12.08]Let's close that out.
[222:17.55]Aye, aye, aye.
[222:20.37]Aye, aye, aye.
[222:29.50]Holy shit, man.
[222:39.94]You guys couldn't even hear.
[222:42.64]That makes it even better for some reason.
[222:44.54]I don't know why that makes it funnier for me.
[222:46.05]We need to sleep.
[222:48.97]We're not going to sleep.
[222:50.73]I need a mate.
[222:57.15]Someone just made their name on Twitch.
[222:58.72]German needs an alligator.
[223:02.42]Really?
[223:05.92]Are you going to lay down with me?
[223:10.25]Alright.
[223:10.69]Well, you're... No, I don't... I don't want a desperate mule.
[223:18.22]I want a sexy woman.
[223:26.73]Let's see how this one is over here.
[223:38.33]Fucking destroyed.
[223:39.37]All right.
[223:40.07]This one is nice.
[223:42.15]Yes, she is.
[223:43.07]Okay.
[223:44.77]Gotta go up there.
[223:45.73]That just sounded like my mic was cutting out.
[223:54.26]I am so embarrassed.
[223:56.30]At the same time, I kind of don't even care.
[224:02.28]Average.
[224:03.10]Well, average is better than desperate.
[224:05.34]Keep that in mind.
[224:09.18]Would you rather have somebody desperate or somebody average?
[224:14.72]I don't know.
[224:16.50]I don't know.
[224:16.88]Huh.
[224:19.06]Good question.
[224:24.48]It's a good question.
[224:30.36]Plus two stamina!
[224:31.28]Okay.
[224:31.54]I'd rather have someone stupid.
[224:36.49]Why do you want somebody stupid?
[224:39.28]Alright, we're gonna go up.
[224:40.34]Any more challenges to do, like, that are around here somewhere?
[224:43.78]Change generation, take in 300 calories, head for the suburbs, complete all E challenges.
[224:50.34]Any other bosses?
[224:52.14]Defeat the golden retriever boss.
[224:57.03]Uh, where?
[224:59.59]Oh, it's locked.
[225:00.23]Okay, we'll just keep going.
[225:06.99]I'd rather just have an alligator.
[225:10.42]I would too.
[225:12.74]Trust me, my friend.
[225:13.94]I would too.
[225:15.18]It's too bad we can't have everything.
[225:16.38]Okay, this is a gazelle.
[225:20.40]Gazelle dead.
[225:23.40]Now there's a boss hyena.
[225:24.83]There's a huge hyena here.
[225:27.21]I'll just call it in the cavalry.
[225:28.31]That's great.
[225:28.99]Okay.
[225:29.89]There's a bunch of giant hyenas, but you're fucking around with third generation Beagle.
[225:34.39]They're eating their own.
[225:36.97]Take this.
[225:37.59]Take it.
[225:38.22]Take the free kills.
[225:40.06]Because they're so stupid.
[225:41.36]And now I get a bunch of fucking level.
[225:44.34]Perfect.
[225:47.98]I will take a free level up, for sure.
[225:52.14]They were just eating their own.
[225:54.40]And I will be a veteran with this, like, third generation.
[226:00.05]There we go.
[226:01.11]Nice.
[226:02.95]Oh, that makes... You know, guys, that makes me real happy.
[226:04.89]You know what I mean?
[226:08.49]It's all about the Beagle.
[226:14.17]I think it's going to be all about the Beagle, guys.
[226:16.35]I'm trying.
[226:16.73]I want to get to like 50 years.
[226:17.80]I think it's possible.
[226:19.28]Defeat the Golden Retriever boss.
[226:24.84]Who is somewhere.
[226:31.32]What the fuck was that?
[226:34.16]What?

[226:43.84]Holy shit.
[226:45.18]Okay, that was terrifying.
[226:46.36]He came out of nowhere.
[226:50.60]I'm going to hide for a second because I'm kind of concerned about that.
[226:53.30]Alright, well, thankfully I still have a couple of guys.
[227:01.95]Just a couple of guys.
[227:06.79]Not a big deal.
[227:10.10]Level that up.
[227:13.04]Oh, uh, whoops.
[227:14.96]Whoops, didn't have that on all stream.
[227:20.36]Now I feel bad.

[237:50.87]I still have a friend.
[237:53.15]One more wolf.
[237:55.13]Is that a hyena?
[237:56.79]Whatever it is, it's fucking dead.
[237:59.49]Did he get toxic by touching that stupid dumb motherfucker?
[238:02.41]He did.
[238:03.75]I gotta kill this monkey.
[238:10.09]Stop dodging.
[238:11.71]Stop it.
[238:12.85]I have to kill you.
[238:15.11]That's fine.
[238:15.49]I'll kill you instead of you.
[238:19.03]18 years.
[238:19.35]Come on, drop it.
[238:20.29]Drop it down to like at least 60.
[238:23.47]Where's the monkey?
[238:25.65]Monkey!
[238:26.09]Okay, thank God there's already somebody here.
[238:31.74]Is it desperate?
[238:32.90]Not desperate.
[238:33.78]It's a perfect mate.
[238:35.80]We gotta go all the way down.
[238:36.68]Am I gonna make it in time?
[238:40.80]I think so.
[238:46.82]Just gotta go down, and then... Okay, good.
[238:48.60]I think there's a monkey running this way, too.
[238:52.48]Yep.
[238:52.92]It's alright.
[238:53.56]Don't need it.
[238:53.90]Let's go make the babies.
[239:00.80]And eat it.
[239:02.78]I got like 4,000 calories here.
[239:04.52]A lot of calories!
[239:14.47]What game is this?
[239:15.07]This is Tokyo Jungle.
[239:19.27]Look at all those puppies I have now.
[239:20.29]Plus three stamina.
[239:22.65]Oh, wow.
[239:23.05]Look at this fucking pack.
[239:23.93]I have five dogs now.
[239:28.21]Just five stamina.
[239:29.06]I'm ready.
[239:30.40]I'm ready to go take on whatever I need to take on.
[239:33.60]I'm gonna go all the way.
[239:34.26]We're gonna go top left.
[239:37.28]This is a pack.
[239:38.10]This is what you play for.
[239:39.24]You know what I mean?
[239:42.61]This is what you fucking play for, boys and girls.
[239:51.49]We have an army of beagles.
[239:54.54]Still would lose to a lion?
[239:55.62]I beg to differ.
[240:00.40]No, sorry.
[240:02.38]I beg to differ.
[240:07.88]Let's go... up.
[240:14.40]Nice vest.
[240:16.20]Look, watch this.
[240:18.36]Think you're gonna fuck with me?
[240:19.92]You wanna fuck with me?
[240:25.83]Come on down here.
[240:28.17]Bring all your friends.
[240:32.73]Beagle versus... Beagle... Beagle versus wolves.
[240:39.96]Beagles win.
[240:44.24]Go kill the retriever.
[240:47.41]No.
[240:48.25]I'm way too far up at this point.
[240:49.45]I'm too high up here.
[240:50.23]I gotta run all the way back.
[240:52.19]Might as well go up.
[240:57.43]I didn't lose anybody, did I?
[240:58.47]No.
[240:59.03]Complete all D challenges.
[241:00.35]Oh, I didn't do that.
[241:01.05]Oh, well.
[241:04.76]Can't make that jump.
[241:05.52]I can go over here, though.
[241:08.68]Come on, dogs.
[241:13.31]I'm doing too well as the Beagle.
[241:14.59]I can't do golden... Okay, I thought I just died.
[241:16.47]I thought I just went into the fucking abyss right there.
[241:17.95]That would have been so terrible.
[241:20.59]Can I go this way?
[241:21.87]Yes.
[241:27.56]Make the jump.
[241:29.64]There we go.
[241:35.68]God damn it.
[241:37.18]Come on.
[241:43.50]There we go.
[241:43.88]That was kind of a pain in the ass.
[241:47.36]But I'll take it.
[241:48.08]This is toxic up here.
[241:50.89]Run.
[241:52.43]Get out of here.
[241:52.99]I don't think I have to actually go down the stairs.
[241:58.75]I don't have any food with me.
[242:06.74]Alright, come on.
[242:10.36]Come on, dogs.
[242:12.69]We're almost out.
[242:16.23]Almost.
[242:17.07]Here we are.
[242:17.53]Okay.
[242:19.69]New zone.
[242:22.81]Yamanote.
[242:26.76]Life decreasing due to hunger.
[242:28.48]Oh, shit.
[242:32.46]This place is huge, too.
[242:33.92]God damn it.
[242:34.64]Come on.
[242:35.06]Give me a rabbit or something.
[242:36.00]Anything.
[242:37.50]I don't want to lose my jacket.
[242:43.17]Where the hell is everything?
[242:43.87]Where are the animals?
[242:48.61]Was there just nothing up here, or did I... I should have paid attention.
[242:51.03]No, there's stuff up here.
[242:53.19]Not a ton of animals up here, but there's enough to eat something.
[242:58.52]Well, say goodbye to... What was that cartoon dog, or that movie dog?
[243:02.72]Here we go, right here.
[243:05.04]I gotta get there quick.
[243:05.86]This poor, innocent animal needs to get killed right now.
[243:10.56]Lion cub.
[243:11.20]Eat him!
[243:12.46]Eat him!
[243:12.78]Nice.
[243:14.24]Lucky.
[243:21.20]Should've bought the gator.
[243:26.32]Never gonna live that down.
[243:27.79]Ever.
[243:30.23]Look at how fucking majestic this is.
[243:39.80]He's like a boss.
[243:42.53]He's a lot of health.
[243:44.71]I have to kill him.
[243:52.93]He's got no where to go.
[243:57.39]Don't.
[243:58.71]Why is he a horn?
[244:08.56]He's just like a fucking clown horn.
[244:10.79]Oh fuck it, whatever, he's too strong.
[244:14.61]Did I just drink blood?
[244:15.65]I don't think so.
[244:16.25]I'm drinking the water.
[244:29.26]This- the one ant- this one giraffe.
[244:33.30]All the way up here.
[244:34.00]Are you shitting me?
[244:35.42]This one giraffe.
[244:37.36]That's great.
[244:44.01]That's not true.
[244:44.61]There's more over here.
[244:46.87]Yemen out west.
[244:49.49]What's up there?
[244:50.36]Something in the train?
[244:51.16]I think it's inside the boxcar.
[244:54.24]It's asleep now.
[244:58.22]What is it?
[245:01.63]Good, it's lambs.
[245:02.33]Things are easy to kill.
[245:15.15]They have a lot of meat on them, too.
[245:16.23]That's great.
[245:20.54]Unlock the giraffe.
[245:27.76]Almost a boss.
[245:29.48]And we'll be even more stronger.
[245:31.64]Even more stronger.
[245:32.82]Boss.
[245:36.68]Perfect.
[245:36.94]25 years.
[245:48.41]More stronger.
[245:49.27]Here, guys, we're more stronger now than we ever were before.
[245:57.73]Go get Golden Retriever.
[246:05.12]No, we don't... We're so far up north now, I need to find, like, the real animals.
[246:10.36]The scary ones.
[246:11.64]For me to instantly kill.
[246:18.48]There it is.
[246:18.78]There's a dinosaur.
[246:20.74]It's a buffalo.
[246:31.48]Got it.
[246:37.24]Watch out.
[246:37.82]Watch out, guys.
[246:39.04]Don't get yourself killed.
[246:42.22]He's running away.
[246:49.80]Uh, I gotta kill that buffalo, right?
[246:51.66]Here comes something else.
[246:52.30]Fucking pig.
[246:56.06]Watch out for the pig.
[247:02.42]Go get it.
[247:02.92]I'm gonna go get it.
[247:05.04]But there's like an area over here that I need to go to.
[247:08.75]He ran away.
[247:09.39]He's a fucking coward.
[247:11.15]I'm not a coward.
[247:11.79]Come on, I'll show you how much of a coward I am.
[247:24.74]Bite him again.
[247:25.18]There he goes.
[247:26.73]He ain't gonna get away.
[247:33.75]Don't worry.
[247:34.21]I'm gonna sneak up on him again and bite him right in the ass.
[247:40.80]Ha!
[247:41.58]Ha ha ha!
[247:42.14]Ha ha ha!
[247:43.90]Ha ha!
[247:58.48]I gotta get out of here.
[248:00.44]Where's the f- Watch out, dog!
[248:04.20]Dogs, what are you doing?
[248:05.34]Don't go out- Don't walk out!
[248:06.82]What are you- You stupid doggies!
[248:09.29]What have you thunk?
[248:10.05]What have you thunk?
[248:12.19]What have you- What have you thunk?
[248:16.29]We gotta go.
[248:20.19]What are you do- Alright, time to go.
[248:21.77]Run.
[248:22.19]This is where we run.
[248:22.83]Not where there's toxic and shit.
[248:28.03]Come on, I told you I wasn't a coward.
[248:30.83]I told you I wasn't a coward.
[248:33.34]Eat up.
[248:35.20]I'm not leaving.
[248:41.56]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[248:42.52]Don't run that way.
[248:43.10]Where are you running?
[248:43.78]No.
[248:45.32]They're just getting themselves killed.
[248:46.44]Okay, we're good.
[248:50.43]We gotta go.
[248:59.06]I'm being such a cocky asshole right now.
[249:02.10]There's so many things over there to get.
[249:03.59]We gotta go.
[249:04.91]We gotta get out of here.
[249:10.99]Way too much confidence there.
[249:15.98]Let's go, mate.
[249:18.18]Kill another giraffe.
[249:29.60]Get him!
[249:31.12]Don't let him... You ain't gonna let him get away, whatever.
[249:33.13]Let's go Maid.
[249:37.57]Before I die.
[249:38.31]No, there's no way I'm gonna get to the... We're almost at 30 years, I'm not gonna make it to the Retriever.
[249:49.44]Why are there lions on an old railway?
[249:51.29]That's a good question.
[249:58.02]Oh god, there are elephants here.
[250:01.10]Why are there elephants?
[250:09.72]Don't ever fuck with the- OH MY GOD ELEPHANTS CAN'T DO THAT.
[250:13.58]ELEPHANTS CAN'T DO THAT.
[250:15.68]I've never seen an elephant that could do that before.
[250:18.02]Sorry guys.
[250:20.90]Elephants don't jump.
[250:34.96]Oh no, I'm toxic.
[250:36.70]I'm fucking toxic.
[250:38.92]Oh shit, he's dead.
[250:41.95]Okay, time to go.
[250:42.77]Can I pick up the items?
[250:44.35]Go.
[250:44.93]Alright, well you have a new wife.
[250:46.05]Go.
[250:48.65]Goodbye.
[250:54.52]You can marry my brother.
[251:02.04]Come here, come have sex with my brother.
[251:13.33]Why did I do that?
[251:15.53]Uh... I don't know, because... It's the first time I've ever seen an elephant, and... It's interesting.
[251:22.95]We didn't lose any items, what are you talking about?
[251:26.11]I'm good.
[251:28.78]I guess I thought I was gonna lose shit?
[251:30.04]No.
[251:30.48]I got another generation.
[251:33.37]We're gonna go this way.
[251:34.23]We're gonna look at the challenges.
[251:38.95]Score seven clean kills in 31 years.
[251:41.84]Okay, if I live to be 45 years, I need seven, these are locked, active.
[251:47.66]These are all failed, right?
[251:51.12]30 years.
[251:51.48]Okay, these are the ones that are about to unlock.
[251:55.91]I have like 10 seconds to do this.
[251:58.57]Find jungle 24.
[252:01.41]Mark three more times.
[252:04.06]I could have taken 1500 more calories.
[252:08.43]That ain't gonna happen.
[252:13.91]I'll go down to Shibuya Station.
[252:18.92]This place is a dump right now.
[252:22.74]I'm gonna go down.
[252:24.90]Down here.
[252:29.80]Going 30 years.
[252:31.94]There it is.
[252:32.54]The big 3-0.
[252:36.11]Oh, is it too late?
[252:39.39]When do I have to do that by?
[252:45.39]When do I have to do that by?
[252:47.01]Hold on.
[252:47.33]I have 10 years to do this.
[252:59.96]Failure in 10 more years.
[253:01.06]I can still do it.
[253:06.49]I got plenty of time.
[253:07.17]I got 10 years.
[253:07.73]I got 10 years.
[253:14.70]That's a long time.
[253:21.93]I gotta claim this whole place again.
[253:23.35]I'm not gonna do that.
[253:25.91]I gotta get down there in ten years.
[253:29.21]I'm making that sound like so... Ah, dude, I don't know, man.
[253:31.77]I gotta get down there in ten years.
[253:33.47]I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do that.
[253:38.68]Oh, goddammit.
[253:39.80]Really?
[253:43.52]Well... I'm about to walk into lions.
[253:49.38]I need...
[253:51.93]I need health.
[253:54.24]I don't have any items and I'm getting like stuck up here.
[253:56.62]It's just total fucking darkness.
[254:02.36]It's in dog years.
[254:05.14]Come on.
[254:06.39]I need to fucking eat somebody.
[254:08.03]I gotta eat somebody and it's all dark and I can't see anything.
[254:13.83]I gotta get back up here.
[254:14.81]Oh come on.
[254:17.35]What?
[254:17.55]Shit.
[254:20.04]Shit.
[254:27.59]I can't see a goddamn thing.
[254:32.56]I think I'm going the right way.
[254:33.76]I have no idea.
[254:37.68]Well, this one's dead.
[254:40.18]Thanks for finding the correct way in pitch black.
[254:42.64]Now we get to have one of your friends take over and put on another jacket.
[254:47.98]And you're all the way up here.
[254:49.06]Oh, you fucking little dick.
[254:59.84]Okay, we gotta go down from here.
[255:04.72]Sorry, dog.
[255:07.98]We're good.
[255:08.95]Eight years?
[255:10.45]Almost there.
[255:10.83]I could sleep right here, couldn't I?
[255:16.35]No, of course I can't.
[255:19.53]Gotta go down to the left.
[255:23.48]Jeez, it's a pain.
[255:24.56]This is such a pain in the ass getting over here.
[255:28.44]It's going to take me 10 years to get there.
[255:30.49]It actually might.
[255:32.05]I'm going to lose all the dogs.
[255:37.51]Actually, everyone might die.
[255:42.82]Unless I can get to a food area right now.
[255:47.14]I'm already toxic to a drink.
[255:56.07]Hey guys, I'm going to make it 32 years.
[255:59.74]Just like in real life.
[256:05.59]That's as far as I go.
[256:11.23]Drink, bro.
[256:11.67]Alright, and then... Alright, let's go.
[256:17.15]Come on.
[256:18.81]Give me another, like, pool to drink out of.
[256:20.59]Down and to the right.
[256:25.04]Seven years.
[256:33.01]Seven years!
[256:34.11]Still, it's not possible.
[256:38.57]There's no food here.
[256:41.29]Holy shit, this is gonna be a nightmare.
[256:43.45]I'm gonna go this way.
[256:46.89]Any more pools to drink out of?
[256:48.12]Any more dirty pools?
[256:52.36]Yes, I know I'm hungry.
[256:55.38]Where are all the animals?
[256:56.26]Apparently, they're not spawning anymore.
[257:02.62]What's going to happen first?
[257:03.22]Am I going to die from toxicity or am I going to die from starvation?
[257:06.31]Or am I going to have sex before that all happens?
[257:10.75]Why mark these?
[257:11.65]Because if I mark these and I get a mate and I have sex, then I get back to full health, like full hunger.
[257:20.14]And that's what we're going to do.
[257:28.60]Desperate.
[257:30.45]Bring me the most desperate fucking woman you can.
[257:32.97]And then we're gonna mate.
[257:38.25]Do you mate before you die?
[257:40.61]Although I might die before we mate.
[257:45.84]It's gonna be close.
[257:51.20]It's gonna be real close, actually.
[257:53.26]Get to the mound!
[257:55.46]Come on!
[257:56.04]Outbreed hunger!
[257:57.18]You can do it!
[257:58.46]Get there!
[257:58.86]Mate!
[258:00.21]We're good.
[258:08.18]Perfect.
[258:10.24]There we go, see?
[258:11.56]New generation, happy birthday.
[258:14.70]No toxicity.
[258:17.14]Hunger is fine.
[258:17.98]And now we just gotta go back down and around.
[258:20.54]And there are animals here now, apparently.
[258:27.60]Hopefully we run into one.
[258:39.19]That's the strategy right there, guys, if you don't know.
[258:40.87]You've got about five years.
[258:47.48]What are these?
[258:48.58]These are Retrievers.
[258:53.34]These are Retrievers.
[258:57.38]Doesn't matter if I'm young.
[258:59.60]You're fucking with a lot of generations here.
[259:06.05]Probably gonna get the veteran.
[259:08.55]Get a gift?
[259:09.15]Pet medicine, that's good.
[259:15.78]Except they're all toxic.
[259:17.50]They're all fucking toxic and I should have known that.
[259:19.52]This reduces toxicity.
[259:24.49]God fucking dammit.
[259:28.81]Get me out of this shit hole.
[259:33.71]Uh, well, okay.
[259:35.01]Find me the Golden Retriever, boss.
[259:41.26]He's here somewhere.
[259:42.30]Hanging out in one of the flags.
[259:47.58]Golden Retriever, boss!
[259:50.68]No, it's not.
[259:52.12]It's a very aggressive Golden Retriever, whatever.
[259:57.45]Not the boss, but it's okay.
[260:01.36]Okay, I went nice.
[260:02.22]I leveled up.
[260:03.02]Thank God.
[260:08.34]Leveling up clears you.
[260:09.70]That's good to know.
[260:12.06]40,000 points.
[260:15.67]I know what I'm doing.
[260:16.51]Come on.
[260:19.35]I just jumped over that shit.
[260:20.49]Nice dodge.
[260:21.47]Retrieve.
[260:23.23]Not good enough, though.
[260:29.04]Constant toxicity.
[260:30.16]This is so annoying.
[260:36.29]God damn it.
[260:37.69]I thought right after you kill something, it's not toxic.
[260:39.81]But I left for too long and he became toxic?
[260:43.27]What are you talking about?
[260:45.21]I hear a monkey, I think.
[260:47.57]There's the boss.
[260:58.59]Boss.
[260:59.77]That's...
[261:03.18]Oh no.
[261:04.00]Oh shit.
[261:04.74]It is oh no.
[261:05.24]It is an oh no situation.
[261:12.82]Easy now.
[261:13.36]Alright, let him get- I don't even care if he gets away.
[261:24.41]I want to eat this.
[261:28.55]Oh no, seriously.
[261:29.01]Like, we got these bosses that are in the game.
[261:32.77]And man, they sure are unintimidating.
[261:35.05]It's just an unlock.
[261:39.65]40,000 points.
[261:40.28]Let's go unlock this thing.
[261:42.52]There goes a monkey.
[261:43.86]Two monkeys.
[261:50.28]Please kill him.
[261:52.07]Do not let him get away.
[261:52.89]Alright, we're good.
[262:00.65]I think getting to 50 years is looking like more of a plus, guys.
[262:03.97]I think it's gonna happen.
[262:08.92]Unlock a monkey.
[262:11.82]We only got like 10 more years to go.
[262:13.60]And then we... We did it.
[262:16.10]50 years.
[262:21.50]One more.
[262:29.23]All these plants are toxic.
[262:31.50]That's no good.
[262:36.58]Put on some... ...blows?
[262:39.02]Oh.
[262:39.14]I forgot I even had those.
[262:41.02]The next generation will have it.
[262:43.10]This will be... seven, right?
[262:45.34]Seventh generation?
[262:47.89]Oh, no.
[262:48.57]I can pick and choose right now.
[262:49.57]I don't need to have a desperate person.
[262:50.99]I don't know.
[262:55.15]I can pick.
[262:55.81]Here comes a bunch of smog.
[263:02.04]37 plus 10 equals 50.
[263:03.82]Yeah, I mean, it's close enough.
[263:08.05]It's gonna be 49.
[263:08.91]Are you stalking me right now?
[263:18.59]What are you thinking, dude?
[263:22.07]Oh, that was one of the guys from the pack from before.
[263:23.97]Okay.
[263:26.13]Whatever.
[263:31.58]Alright, give me a pristine.
[263:37.38]Pristine.
[263:39.10]Yes, you are.
[263:40.51]You are very pristine, actually.
[263:42.75]You are as good as it can be.
[263:44.31]And you have a harness on.
[263:46.87]That means you got money.
[263:47.63]I feel like this breed is going to be really good.
[264:04.28]Alright.
[264:05.08]Give me like a good 4 or 5 dogs and take us to 50 years.
[264:08.97]There you go.
[264:20.01]40 years.
[264:20.92]A tiny dino has appeared in Shibuya suburbs.
[264:25.34]Dinosaur.
[264:28.08]We are going there immediately.
[264:31.16]We're gonna go fight the dinosaur.
[264:34.76]With our, like, seven dogs.
[264:39.72]Shibuya suburbs.
[264:40.46]We're on our way there now.
[264:45.48]Time to see the dino.
[264:54.53]Get out of here, though, because we are toxic.
[264:56.69]Got our dog army.
[264:57.71]Gonna go fight the dinosaur.
[264:59.31]I do want to get this guy leveled up, though.
[265:06.68]Have I killed anybody yet?
[265:07.76]I mean, like a person?
[265:12.95]Or other animals?
[265:15.05]Killed plenty of other animals.
[265:18.39]There are a lot of animals.
[265:19.71]There's a lot of food down here.
[265:27.46]Quail balls.
[265:29.70]He's instantly toxic.
[265:31.34]That's fantastic.
[265:32.12]We've got to get out of here.
[265:37.49]God damn it.
[265:38.63]I don't think I really even care about getting like the waypoint, I'm gonna call it.
[265:45.11]Fuck me.
[265:46.82]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, no.
[265:49.34]No, we're gonna go this way.
[265:50.88]I can't eat that.
[265:57.50]Is this toxic?
[265:59.44]No, it's not, okay.
[266:06.28]Yeah, that's just a rabbit.
[266:08.00]Now I'm paranoid.
[266:12.10]I'm so paranoid.
[266:12.84]It's just fucking me up right now.
[266:16.24]Alright, we're good.
[266:18.19]No, we're not!
[266:22.83]I'm like a fucking 30s cartoon.
[266:25.91]Come on!
[266:26.55]He heard that from all the way over there?
[266:29.37]He's just chasing me.
[266:30.15]This is a fucking horror movie.
[266:31.66]Come on, dogs.
[266:32.96]Where are we going?
[266:35.74]Left.
[266:41.35]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[266:45.21]He killed every single person.
[266:48.69]He did one swing and killed every single dog.
[266:53.88]What the fuck, man?
[266:56.96]And now I'm toxic.
[267:00.46]Oh, God.
[267:01.48]Do I have any special moves?
[267:07.68]I'm gonna die of fucking hunger and I'm toxic.
[267:12.25]wait is it where is he why do you you don't just teleport in front of people that's not fair not fair not fair and we all know it not fair not fair that's not that's a teleporting fucking animal
[268:54.69]Why was my mic muted?
[268:56.85]Hold on, how long has this been muted for?
[269:01.01]When did that happen?
[269:02.03]I've been talking.
[269:02.63]Did that just happen?
[269:09.19]How long ago did that happen?
[269:13.77]Since I died?
[269:18.19]No, it has not.
[269:19.17]Are you serious?
[269:26.26]Oh, it's saying 30 seconds.
[269:27.70]Come on.
[269:30.10]We thought you went silent in anger.
[269:42.11]I dropped the controller on the keyboard.
[269:44.75]Apparently, I hit a... This is the first thing you said.
[269:49.67]I dropped it on the K key or something.
[269:54.53]Anyways.
[269:55.77]I'm going to wrap it up there.
[269:56.47]I've been streaming for about five hours.
[270:03.61]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[270:05.84]Sorry we tried to buy a fucking alligator and it just didn't work.
[270:10.74]But maybe I'll turn the stream on tomorrow and just buy the alligator or be sad.
[270:18.93]But before we go, let's read some bits here.
[270:23.87]Thank you for sticking around.
[270:25.59]This is going to... This is going to conclude Tokyo Jungle.
[270:33.74]I might play it tomorrow night for like an hour just to try the alligator and just check it out.
[270:37.82]Who knows?
[270:38.14]I might not.
[270:41.76]But PlayStation 3, again, I'm going to reiterate this again.
[270:46.20]There is a lot of PlayStation 3 content that I have now.
[270:52.00]We're talking about, I don't know if people with that missed the stream earlier.
[270:56.04]I have like 35 PlayStation 3 games that are all potentially very interesting.
[271:03.16]Kind of like stuff like this, like off the beaten path kind of weird shit that I've always wanted to play and I never had a chance to play it.
[271:10.54]so expect a lot more playstation 3 stuff and absolver comes out in like what like a few days or something like that so expect me to play a little bit of absolver as well uh bad games you calling this a bad game this game is very very fun yeah they're not all like terrible games they're all just like different and interesting later alligator
[271:42.47]But have a good night, guys.
[271:44.59]That's going to wrap it up.
[271:45.72]I'm going to close it up by reading some bits.
[271:48.38]So that's not a Be Right Back screen.
[271:51.46]It's this screen.
[271:53.26]No, it's not an intro.
[271:54.56]It's an outro.
[271:55.82]There we go.
[271:59.39]Thank you to Bang.
[272:00.29]That was a pretty great run, though.
[272:02.59]It was good enough.
[272:05.19]I could see how you could get addicted to that game.
[272:07.09]To Tokyo Jungle.
[272:08.15]And play it a lot.
[272:09.67]And... Want to unlock all the animals and stuff.
[272:13.61]It's interesting enough.
[272:15.33]A little repetitive, but still a fun game nonetheless.
[272:18.75]Well worth the money and time.
[272:21.98]Pinwheel, thanks for the $5.
[272:22.70]Hey, Jerma, loving the streams.
[272:24.32]You ever thought about streaming Alien Isolation?
[272:27.12]Your video didn't do it justice.
[272:29.98]Um... To be honest, probably not.
[272:33.78]I... Alien Isolation for me was kind of like playing Amnesia or playing Outlast.
[272:41.43]Where like you kind of just like hide from the monster.
[272:44.57]And it's not that I don't like that kind of game.
[272:46.63]It's just I don't know if I want to stream like another like hide from the monster game.
[272:50.18]Because I played like a bunch of Amnesia.
[272:53.08]I played like Alien Isolation before and I made that obviously that fucking stupid YouTube video.
[272:58.12]But... Yeah.
[273:00.41]Probably not, unfortunately.
[273:01.99]Sorry.
[273:03.45]Sam gave 35 cents an hour ago.
[273:05.89]Twitch has not let me watch ads for like half a year, so have what I was able to get back in February.
[273:15.67]Thanks for the 35 cents.
[273:18.69]Gray1314, thanks for the 25 cents.
[273:22.09]I'm poor, have a quarter.
[273:25.19]Alright, goodnight everybody.
[273:27.16]Thanks for sticking around.
[273:47.54]you
