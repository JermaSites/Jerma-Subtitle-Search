[00:01.58]I am the rocket man they talk about I jump from star to star, I walk it out
[00:20.92]See, I'm red.
[00:21.82]You know I'm blue.
[00:23.14]What is this guy doing?
[00:25.88]This guy has a sniper rifle pointing in the air, and he's just, like, doing some kind of... Yeah, what is that?
[00:31.41]Oh, yeah.
[00:32.87]He's getting down.
[00:34.19]Getting down on Friday right there.
[00:35.53]I have never seen that before.
[00:36.57]This is ridiculous.
[00:38.13]Yeah, what you do is you crouch, look up, and you scope in.
[00:41.45]Yeah, that's what you do.
[00:42.75]Oh, really?
[00:43.59]Yeah.
[00:45.30]Alright.
[00:46.70]I'm going to play soldier this round.
[00:47.78]What are you doing?
[00:48.94]Actually, no, I'll just pocket you.
[00:50.73]Alright.
[00:52.98]Where'd you go?
[00:53.38]Where'd you go?
[00:53.96]Oh, left side.
[00:57.72]So I'm going Stock Rocket Launcher, Shotgun, and Equalizer.
[01:02.18]You're going Kritz Krieg.
[01:04.44]Balut Saga and the Ubersaw.
[01:07.21]There we go.
[01:09.85]I also got a request that we got to try, like, legit battle medics where you have two medics and you try to chain Uber.
[01:15.25]Oh, hell yeah.
[01:16.11]I've never done that before.
[01:17.32]It looks very difficult.
[01:19.25]It can get pretty crazy, because you can end up having an Uber for a full two or three minutes on each side.
[01:26.33]It's pretty insane.
[01:29.29]Alright, grab that health.
[01:30.67]Alright, cap this point.
[01:36.24]Overheal everybody.
[01:37.16]Where are you going, Scout?
[01:42.10]Not happening.
[01:43.00]Nice, nice.
[01:43.80]Alright, let me know when you want it.
[01:47.59]Oh, Baxter.
[01:48.76]Oh, I got him.
[01:49.98]I'll revenge you.
[01:51.00]I'll avenge you, not revenge you.
[01:53.16]Oh, God.
[01:53.74]Never mind.
[01:55.82]I just walked right into a direct hit.
[01:58.78]TF2XXFrank was not having any of that one.
[02:02.87]Alright, I'm not sure where the other spawn point is.
[02:07.63]It's a perfect name.
[02:08.97]There you are.
[02:13.01]Ooh, nice.
[02:13.61]Good call.
[02:15.94]Why would a Pyro just be sitting there?
[02:19.47]Yeah, true.
[02:21.19]It should be herping and derping somewhere.
[02:26.21]This looks like it might just be a GG right here.
[02:29.77]Yeah.
[02:30.15]It's kind of rolling through.
[02:34.15]Let's go take that last point.
[02:37.70]Slowly but surely.
[02:39.60]Got two medics on you now.
[02:42.18]Oh.
[02:43.42]Got a heavy.
[02:48.17]I'm backing up.
[02:48.97]Yeah, back up for a little bit.
[02:51.91]I gotta heal this guy.
[02:54.55]Oh, I got you.
[02:56.43]Oh, watch out spy, turn around.
[02:57.92]Got him.
[03:02.66]Oh, man.
[03:04.16]Another sentry in here somewhere.
[03:05.66]Oh, God.
[03:07.86]Don't know from where.
[03:09.64]Damn, all up top.
[03:12.12]Two sentries up top.
[03:17.03]Is that medic still alive?
[03:17.65]You guys still alive?
[03:19.44]Uh, we both died.
[03:20.80]Or he died, then I died.
[03:22.12]I got a couple soldiers in here.
[03:23.86]Should be all good.
[03:26.20]Yeah, I'm gonna go second floor.
[03:27.60]Take out the sentries.
[03:28.58]Oh, boy.
[03:29.46]Is it heavy in here?
[03:30.10]Oh, God.
[03:30.80]Gabe Newell.
[03:32.08]I don't know if he played with fans of the game.
[03:37.55]You'd think his fingers would be too fat to use the keyboard.
[03:40.03]He's kind of a big boy.
[03:42.39]He is.
[03:46.04]He's a very nice guy, though, apparently.
[03:48.51]That's good.
[03:51.95]When's episode three ever coming out?
[03:54.85]Yeah, I know.
[03:55.71]Did you hear about those protesters that were sitting on the front lawn of Valve headquarters?
[04:01.48]Mm-mm.
[04:01.95]apparently there was protesters sitting on the front lawn of valve like maybe like a week or two ago saying like where's episode three there was only like three or four of them so Gabe Newell went out there and ordered him a pizza so they could like eat and hang out there yeah and eventually I guess somebody called the police and the police officer was a huge Team Fortress 2 fan so he like joined in on the protest nice where is their headquarters located uh I think it's in Seattle
[04:32.52]Who would just want to sit in the rain all day?
[04:34.48]Oh, stereotyping a city.
[04:38.20]Oh, damn.
[04:40.98]Well, I got multiple Ubers here.
[04:42.46]This guy's got a crits.
[04:43.26]You're going to get double crits.
[04:44.94]Oh, man.
[04:45.50]I had double crits.
[04:46.80]I could have used a... Oh, me and this medic.
[04:48.98]Oh, God.
[04:51.44]Got one kill.
[04:52.22]Double pocket.
[04:53.13]I don't think I've ever had the double crits pocket.
[04:55.95]Oh, man.
[04:56.53]That would have been pretty ridiculous.
[04:57.85]Damn engineers with their sentries.
[05:01.97]Turtling up.
[05:05.69]I'm one to talk.
[05:06.61]Engineer is like my favorite class.
[05:08.83]Yeah, I love my combat energy.
[05:10.25]That's probably my second favorite class.
[05:12.27]Oh, yeah.
[05:13.24]It's just fun.
[05:13.94]I don't know.
[05:15.86]I don't know what's about it.
[05:17.38]It's very satisfying, I will say.
[05:18.70]It is.
[05:19.30]Absolutely.
[05:20.86]To work with a non-living object to complete an objective of getting those wins.
[05:30.12]I got like 50% where you're at.
[05:32.12]Second floor, still working on.
[05:33.99]DJ set up Mr. Battlefield Legend playing some Team Fortress.
[05:39.83]I'm still on the second to last point, just healing people up, over healing people.
[05:43.73]Yeah, I'm with Fox, we're good.
[05:53.97]Balls!
[05:54.57]I can't take out that sentry, it's so close, 36 health.
[05:57.93]You want me to change to Uber?
[06:00.73]Probably for this last point, that would make sense.
[06:03.01]I got one more crits fully charged if you want it when you get out.
[06:05.95]No, you can just give it to someone.
[06:07.33]Alright, let's go cut down.
[06:09.13]Me and cut down are going to rip through people.
[06:12.21]He's going to cut down some people.
[06:14.01]Oh, I think he's a spy.
[06:17.61]Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
[06:20.02]Ubered yourself a nice little spy there.
[06:21.84]I just crits Ubered a spy.
[06:23.40]I didn't die, though.
[06:25.20]That's the good part about this whole thing.
[06:28.48]I'm just going suicide medic right now.
[06:30.12]You know, you're just giving him a little, uh, you know, giving him a chance.
[06:33.06]Alright, I got regular uber.
[06:40.35]We should be able to take this out.
[06:41.47]Oh, I'm boned.
[06:44.15]No, I'm still, we're still alive somehow.
[06:54.00]Oh, they got a heavy medic over on the, near the second point.
[06:57.36]Second to last point.
[06:58.18]I got one of, one of two sentries down.
[07:00.64]Oh, I'm crap.
[07:01.22]Yeah.
[07:02.18]Vagabond Dildo with two Ls.
[07:06.44]Laying down.
[07:07.16]Oh, no, no, no.
[07:07.82]Get me out of there.
[07:08.50]Get me out of there.
[07:09.00]Nice.
[07:10.08]I just got a, pretty much a full uber by killing a medic with the Ubersaw.
[07:15.85]Do you, uh, always go Ubersaw?
[07:18.63]Uh, nine times out of ten.
[07:19.81]Just because there's so many opportunities to just hit somebody and get 25 free percent uber.
[07:26.10]If I'm not using the Ubersaw, then I'm using the... What is it called?
[07:29.82]The one where you taunt?
[07:30.94]What's it called?
[07:32.04]Can't even think of it.
[07:34.20]Amputator.
[07:34.62]The amputator, yeah.
[07:35.36]There it is.
[07:38.58]Alright, I got an Uber.
[07:39.38]Alright, I'm coming back to the last point.
[07:43.32]Yeah, I'm standing on the second to last point right now.
[07:48.67]Alright, right behind you.
[07:52.32]Alright, let's see if we can do this.
[07:53.76]Do you have any suggestion which way we should go?
[07:56.10]Where's the sentry?
[07:57.83]Up top?
[07:58.71]Yeah.
[07:58.99]Maybe we should go this way.
[08:02.35]I actually don't really know a fast lane that much.
[08:03.83]Oh god, I just lost you.
[08:05.73]I'm sorry.
[08:08.92]Alright, let's... Oh, the kind sir that I'm doing.
[08:14.56]Alright, looks like they got another sentry on point.
[08:16.68]Let's try to take that out at range.
[08:18.29]And I think this guy's got a crit streak as well, so.
[08:21.45]Oh, don't get killed.
[08:22.25]Oh, boy.
[08:22.91]I'm alright.
[08:23.29]I'm good.
[08:28.45]Crap.
[08:29.39]Oh, God.
[08:29.97]I got to back up.
[08:32.05]The back burner.
[08:33.39]Yeah, that pyro just kind of ran in.
[08:35.47]Me and X-Pac might get this, though.
[08:40.71]The X-Wrestler.
[08:41.17]Oh, bam.
[08:41.71]Giving people the X-Factor.
[08:44.01]They're in bad water right now.
[08:47.63]Hot water.
[08:49.02]Oh god, never mind.
[08:51.21]You know what, that sentry's in a spot where we have to get pretty close.
[08:56.03]It's right in the corner.
[08:58.61]Almost got it.
[08:59.23]Yeah, we're doing work.
[08:59.95]Me and Xpac are doing work.
[09:03.76]Two sentries up here.
[09:05.40]Jesus.
[09:08.14]You know, maybe it'll be good.
[09:09.00]Maybe you should switch to demo.
[09:11.36]Yeah, good point.
[09:11.84]Hold on.
[09:12.12]Almost got these.
[09:19.39]Alright.
[09:19.91]These are two.
[09:20.59]Both down up here.
[09:21.97]Another one below.
[09:23.20]Come on, son.
[09:24.54]Really?
[09:27.76]Oh, you know what?
[09:29.22]I'm gonna switch demo.
[09:30.18]We got three medics right now.
[09:31.88]Oh, son.
[09:34.38]It's down.
[09:34.66]It's down.
[09:35.66]It's down?
[09:36.18]Nice.
[09:37.14]One point.
[09:38.34]Oh, here we go.
[09:39.16]Oh, another one in the corner.
[09:41.08]Come on.
[09:41.69]We almost got it.
[09:44.09]Alright.
[09:45.77]Push.
[09:46.17]Let's go.
[09:47.35]Let's go.
[09:47.59]Let's go.
[09:53.20]Oh, we almost have it.
[09:54.60]Looks like Mr. Pan's slicer doing work.
[09:57.08]Go, go, go.
[10:01.48]Go, go.
[10:02.18]Come on, shibs.
[10:05.00]Oh, Gabe's doing work.
[10:07.11]We got this.
[10:07.63]We got this.
[10:09.27]Where's that sentry?
[10:12.51]Oh, he's trying to move it up top.
[10:13.57]He's trying to move it up here.
[10:15.63]Oh, no, he's not going to get it.
[10:17.31]There's so many guys.
[10:20.01]Oh, wow.
[10:21.09]This is an absolute battle.
[10:25.29]Oh, teleporter and sentries down.
[10:30.38]Teleporter was there, that's weird.
[10:33.20]We just gotta get a mass push and get on there.
[10:38.22]Let's see what we got here.
[10:45.65]Oh, this soldier is in this top room.
[10:57.72]Got him.
[10:58.84]Nice.
[11:01.55]So what do they have?
[11:02.45]Four centuries?
[11:04.19]I got something.
[11:07.03]I'm up there too.
[11:08.13]Trying to spam it down wherever it is.
[11:09.55]Trying to look and see.
[11:12.83]Looks like it's in the right corner.
[11:16.17]Oh yeah, I see it.
[11:17.85]Oh, this engineer's not even there.
