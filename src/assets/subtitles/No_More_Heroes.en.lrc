[00:01.94]good afternoon everybody no music what happened why is it muted I didn't do that I swear to god I didn't do that already upset hi how are you welcome back to another live stream today we are going to be playing
[00:26.89]No more heroes.
[00:27.85]We actually are going to play it today.
[00:29.19]I was going to play it yesterday, but had a little bit of a Bluetooth problem.
[00:33.71]That problem has been resolved.
[00:36.41]Troubleshooting.
[00:38.51]We are now... I'm going to explain something.
[00:44.88]Yeah, it's all set.
[00:46.98]Go to the dentist, you idiot.
[00:48.16]What?
[00:50.70]Did you brush your blue teeth?
[00:55.22]Why would I have blue teeth?
[01:00.94]Why would I have blue teeth?
[01:02.76]I don't understand this reference.
[01:03.88]From what?
[01:07.36]Oh, because of blue tooth.
[01:10.27]I had a blue tooth.
[01:11.59]Jeez.
[01:12.93]And you guys... And you guys... That was weird.
[01:16.81]You guys have -2 shit?
[01:18.37]If I said that, it would be -2 all day.
[01:22.07]You would clip that and say worst joke of the decade.
[01:26.97]Come on now.
[01:27.99]Don't throw stones if you live in a glass house.
[01:35.37]What are we doing?
[01:35.85]Oh yeah, right.
[01:36.33]We're gonna play No More Heroes.
[01:40.70]This is an original Wii game.
[01:43.70]Actually, you could argue this is one of the best games that came out for the Wii.
[01:48.69]We're getting a No More Heroes 3.
[01:49.75]It took a long time to get it, but... We're playing one of the best games on the Wii.
[01:57.60]This game has lightsabers.
[02:02.44]So you could argue that this is a better Star Wars than the sequel saga.
[02:08.00]You could, if you wanted to.
[02:08.94]I'm sure you will in this chat.
[02:15.88]True.
[02:19.40]Why did I just say that?
[02:20.34]Now I'm gonna, like, ignite the fanbase.
[02:24.76]I shouldn't have done that.
[02:25.64]Oh well.
[02:26.20]We just started, too.
[02:27.98]JermaSucks just gave 20 community subs.
[02:32.91]What fanbase?
[02:33.75]Omega LOL.
[02:34.87]Okay.
[02:35.65]You don't make an entire theme park around Star Wars unless at least 100 people are gonna go.
[02:45.82]JermaSucks really just gave 20 subs, though.
[02:47.54]Thank you, JermaSucks.
[02:49.48]We'll see if I suck, because this game's hard.
[02:52.35]It requires skill, it requires timing and patience.
[02:57.84]It's a third-person, slashing, dodging, blocking game.
[03:02.68]70, yeah, channel points have been changed a little bit.
[03:10.08]It is now, prices have changed.
[03:13.12]And if you accumulate 75,000 points, I'll wink on camera.
[03:19.65]After the 20 community subs, $100.
[03:23.54]by Phylactery.
[03:25.85]Ten thousand bits.
[03:30.35]Thousands of dollars that Phylactery has given over the last few months continues to grow.
[03:36.14]They say, missed the last few live streams, so had to watch the VODs.
[03:39.22]Here's some money for sucking on that used Wiimote and putting on lipstick.
[03:43.52]Jesus.
[03:49.35]Thanks a lot for the huge fucking money drop, man.
[03:53.84]10,000 bits from File Actor Lich.
[03:56.64]I didn't even tweet that I was live.
[03:57.98]It's because my phone was dead.
[04:00.78]Give me like two minutes.
[04:02.09]We'll get going.
[04:03.01]Get comfortable.
[04:03.99]Get comfortable.
[04:05.95]My words are hard today.
[04:06.87]They were hard last night, too.
[04:07.91]What's wrong with me?
[04:08.55]Be right back.
[04:55.95]Alright, we've been tweeted.
[04:57.41]It's time to move over to no more heroes.
[05:09.05]No more heroes for the Nintendo Wii.
[05:16.48]I got my Wiimote, I got my nunchuck.
[05:18.78]Do you have to use both?
[05:21.06]This is where we pick the difficulty.
[05:24.64]There's only two difficulties right now because you have to beat the game, I believe, first.
[05:30.17]How did I get the remote to connect?
[05:32.23]A lot of bullshit.
[05:35.95]I mean, sure, why don't we go off on this?
[05:40.04]No, I don't want to go off every stream.
[05:43.20]I don't need to go off.
[05:50.10]I feel like every time I go off, I'm just leaving you guys a really long, annoying string of ten voicemails on your machine in a row.
[05:59.89]We don't gotta do that today.
[06:01.17]Let's just put it this way.
[06:02.79]It... Let's put it this way.
[06:06.25]It didn't work.
[06:07.25]I have internal Bluetooth.
[06:09.71]So I... Most of the... Bluetooth sucks, by the way.
[06:12.67]The technology never took off.
[06:15.13]But it took off for, like, three years.
[06:18.91]No, you know, I'm not going off.
[06:20.09]No, I'm not.
[06:20.49]I'm just telling you.
[06:20.99]I'm just going to give you some facts about what happened with this story.
[06:23.95]Just going to get the bullet points.
[06:26.42]My... Everybody's motherboard has a Wi-Fi card built into it, mostly.
[06:31.06]You know, internal.
[06:32.50]I have an internal Bluetooth.
[06:34.28]It's not good enough.
[06:35.54]It picked up five, six probably, houses down the street.
[06:40.05]Somebody's, like, fire stick.
[06:42.70]Okay.
[06:43.78]But it won't get my Wiimote.
[06:44.82]And it won't get anything in my room.
[06:46.62]So I had to go get a couple of different dongles to test it out.
[06:50.14]And... Try to get it to work.
[06:53.56]And I finally got one dongle in particular.
[06:56.64]That worked.
[06:58.14]To connect my Wiimote.
[07:01.73]But, there you go.
[07:02.51]It didn't even go off.
[07:04.33]We're not going to do sweet.
[07:05.01]We're going to do mild.
[07:06.19]This game's hard.
[07:07.69]Many strong men await you.
[07:08.91]Yeah, it's going to be hard.
[07:14.78]You're not going to shout them out.
[07:18.40]You want me to... You want me to shout out a Bluetooth adapter?
[07:28.41]Okay, so... You would like for me to shout out a Bluetooth adapter.
[07:35.55]Special thank you to... I don't even know what the name of this thing is.
[07:43.28]It's...
[07:45.61]What is it?
[07:48.45]No, that's the wrong one.
[07:49.29]I don't want to shout out the... Is it dinner time?
[07:52.83]What was that?
[07:53.37]I want to say this right, because if I say it wrong, I'm going to be like a dick.
[08:04.34]A targus?
[08:06.92]Is that correct?
[08:09.44]It's... Guys, it came in a package.
[08:14.18]Hold on.
[08:14.56]I need to... I have to go under my fucking desk.
[08:17.64]Hold on.
[08:18.08]I don't even know what the package is that I took.
[08:27.33]There it is!
[08:29.13]Yeah, it's a Tarkus.
[08:32.32]Yep.
[08:33.30]So you can thank Tarkus Gaming.
[08:36.48]for letting this happen.
[08:38.20]I know a lot of gamers out there don't have much patience, because that's what Bishop, the dude at the video store, said.
[08:43.54]Oh, wait, you're not supposed to see this yet.
[08:48.24]Gamers.
[08:49.50]Yep, Travis Touch.
[08:50.83]By the way, I want to make this prediction now, because that's what I do, that's what we do on this channel.
[08:56.55]Travis Touchdown is going to be DLC pack number two.
[09:00.51]Fighters Pass 2, character number three.
[09:03.11]There you go.
[09:05.16]just that's going that's that what that's what's happening alright let's do it mild mild here we go no more heroes
[09:24.78]You do ride a motorcycle in this game.
[09:27.10]And notoriously, all the motorcycle, uh, driver, but that's a full letter grade.
[09:31.20]Because you do get to drive it.
[09:33.30]Unfortunately, the motorcycle, it slows down the entire game.
[09:39.14]And no more heroes on the original Wii.
[09:43.81]In the motorcycle segments.
[09:45.39]Ran at probably 15 frames a second.
[09:46.93]I know a lot of gamers out there don't have much patience.
[09:49.65]At least that's what Bishop, the dude at the video store, said.
[09:54.38]So I'm at the register, then I realized I got no money.
[09:57.96]I was seriously broke.
[10:00.22]Why?
[10:01.06]Because I met this smoking hot chick last night at the death match bar.
[10:05.51]Man, she smelled good.
[10:08.29]So being the gentleman I am, I bought her a drink.
[10:11.79]Anywho, I decide to get a job.
[10:14.63]The gig?
[10:15.55]Assassinate the Drifter.
[10:17.59]I love this game.
[10:18.13]So I went where I was supposed to and waited for the guy to show up.
[10:21.59]And there he was.
[10:22.83]This cat.
[10:23.67]Well-dressed, cool.
[10:25.21]Couldn't tell if he was the shit or just plain old shit.
[10:29.02]Yeah, so he's stylish, fast, aggressive, and packing heat.
[10:32.42]Bada-bing.
[10:33.70]Or at least it was supposed to be.
[10:35.84]Till she showed up.
[10:37.73]Her name?
[10:38.99]Sylvia Crystal, an agent with this Watcher McCullough Association.
[10:43.29]Congratulations.
[10:44.77]You are certified as the 11th best hitman.
[10:50.04]I'm so pumped up for the new one.
[10:56.34]I want to be number one.
[10:58.18]How's that?
[10:59.30]Short and simple enough for you?
[11:01.55]It's gonna be a long, hard road.
[11:04.77]But who knows?
[11:06.23]Could kick ass.
[11:07.81]Could be dangerous.
[11:09.75]Could totally suck.
[11:12.18]What do you say, bro?
[11:13.50]And yes, that is the TF2 medic.
[11:14.86]That is, uh, is it Robert?
[11:16.28]Robert Atkinson?
[11:17.66]That is the TF2 medic.
[11:29.92]That's the medic, and he does a handful of voices in this, by the way.
[11:34.98]And you're finally gonna get to hear, you're gonna get to hear it, I can't wait for you to hear it.
[11:39.66]How many times have you guys heard me say on this stream?
[11:42.59]Are you prepared, Hef?
[11:44.65]At least a hundred.
[11:46.97]Fuckhead!
[11:54.72]Yes, I'm so ready for this.
[11:55.62]Yo, help me out here.
[11:56.78]Where's this death metal dude?
[12:01.08]Bad answer.
[12:01.88]It's better than Star Wars movies.
[12:09.01]And you upgrade.
[12:09.75]You can get different lightsabers.
[12:12.25]It's like 10 different lightsabers.
[12:14.33]There's like 20 lightsabers across the whole game.
[12:16.15]I can't wait.
[12:17.43]Let's do it.
[12:21.64]I actually do not need to do the tutorial.
[12:24.84]I don't.
[12:25.92]I know what the fuck I'm doing.
[12:36.05]Oh, it feels so good to play!
[12:38.20]It feels so good to play.
[12:40.84]Now those of you that want to know, there is two stances in this game.
[12:46.76]I might have to turn it down a little bit.
[12:48.35]A little bit on the loud side for you.
[12:51.47]So, if you see the Wii mode, I'm tilting it right now.
[12:55.13]You have high, obviously.
[12:57.59]You have low.
[12:59.75]And you have to choose between the two.
[13:01.59]And if you're facing the same... I'm so excited.
[13:04.73]I'm so happy right now.
[13:05.81]Alright, let's go.
[13:08.17]Let's go.
[13:08.77]I can't wait any longer.
[13:09.51]I gotta go.
[13:09.87]Let's do it!
[13:28.87]The best part about this is everybody has that same voice when you kill somebody.
[13:33.11]They go... That is also Robert acting down.
[13:46.84]Doing that voice.
[13:47.70]Oh!
[13:56.14]This looks like a prototype for Metal Gear Rising.
[13:58.16]This is a better Star Wars game than Metal Gear Rising.
[14:01.51]I'm sorry, it is.
[14:03.17]I know I'm gonna probably offend people.
[14:07.87]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14:11.41]Get the- I was looking to chat, I was looking to chat, I know.
[14:14.73]Plus health.
[14:18.80]I hate everything about this.
[14:19.92]Everything.
[14:20.24]This would be the worst stream of the decade if I could make it.
[14:27.66]Get that person out of here.
[14:28.98]Get him out of here!
[14:30.16]Get him out of here!
[14:32.98]That's unbelievable for me to hear that.
[14:40.11]I have to be careful, though, because I will use the Wiimote, because I'm sitting close to the mic.
[14:44.18]I will smash this into the mic.
[14:48.24]I can't be hearing this right now.
[14:49.68]I can't be hearing this.
[14:54.06]This is a classic video game.
[14:56.32]Like, one of the best fo- I would say this is- No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2 is some of the- one of the best of the last generation.
[15:05.49]You know what I mean?
[15:06.05]I think it is.
[15:06.63]Got a trading card.
[15:12.17]Don't anger Jeremy, he's in a good mood today.
[15:14.75]Alright, be careful.
[15:20.18]I'm gonna get a double.
[15:25.02]Oh, you guys think that this... Wait, hold it.
[15:26.72]You don't like this game?
[15:27.64]Did somebody say they didn't like this game?
[15:30.52]We'll see in about five seconds.
[15:34.19]Wait, I don't want to die.
[15:38.29]Here we go!
[15:41.95]Get him!
[15:46.02]Get him!
[15:53.48]Hold on.
[15:54.20]I'll show you.
[15:55.06]I'll show you why.
[15:58.52]I'm just having fun slicing people up.
[16:00.08]Here we go.
[16:01.04]Oh, I got a power-up!
[16:01.82]I can't even tell what's happening.
[16:08.95]Alright, you sure you don't like this game?
[16:20.01]Your grapple moves are all wrestling moves.
[16:26.38]He just did it.
[16:26.78]He said it.
[16:27.30]He said it.
[16:28.67]Are you prepared?
[16:29.17]Help!
[16:29.85]Alright, we're good.
[16:36.71]Only one more?
[16:38.17]Watch that.
[16:38.63]Walk.
[16:45.02]Trading card number two.
[16:45.86]I think there's a hundred?
[16:47.16]Two hundred?
[16:51.64]This is what it's like when a kid is showing their parents their Minecraft house.
[17:03.14]Look at my house!
[17:06.24]Oh, wait!
[17:06.74]You can do this!
[17:09.99]That's how you charge the battery.
[17:11.23]It's got like that solar LED technology.
[17:14.65]It's not a Minecraft house.
[17:21.91]I know for a fact that half of you guys have never even seen this game before.
[17:24.90]So, yeah, maybe it is my Minecraft house.
[17:26.80]I'm happy to show it.
[17:29.60]Money?
[17:31.94]Money?
[17:36.00]Alright, this uh, this uh... Fucking Minecraft house.
[17:48.05]Where are they?
[17:51.49]This guy, look at, he's got lightsaber fist weapons.
[17:54.07]They didn't put that in any of these Star Wars.
[18:18.46]That's legit, yeah.
[18:19.46]Are you excited for No More Heroes 3?
[18:20.82]Oh, you better believe it.
[18:21.73]That's why I'm playing this one.
[18:22.81]We haven't even gotten to the open world yet.
[18:28.76]There's many games you have to work.
[18:31.62]I remember hating that part of the game.
[18:33.36]Okay, do you think I'm gonna hate that part of the game again?
[18:36.16]It's been like 12 years.
[18:38.00]You think I'm still gonna get really mad at like collecting coconuts?
[18:44.26]Wait, check that out.
[18:48.98]They're mildly fun.
[18:55.32]You're gonna like it more than the main game.
[18:57.10]I mean, it's possible.
[18:59.20]But I don't think so.
[19:00.84]Oh, I gotta go back down.
[19:07.90]The only bullshit one is the one with the scorpion.
[19:09.54]I don't even remember it.
[19:12.22]The scorpions?
[19:17.34]You have to, like, step on a scorpion?
[19:23.00]Turn on the camera when you charge the saber.
[19:25.97]Well, do you have 75,000 channel points yet?
[19:28.35]That's how you get the camera to turn on.
[19:34.52]I don't see anybody with 75,000 yet.
[19:36.18]Alright, let's do it.
[19:42.04]What a pain!
[19:50.57]You're a joke!
[19:51.57]What a pain!
[19:52.53]You're a joke!
[19:55.85]That's your battery.
[19:57.09]Alright.
[19:59.05]Who?
[20:00.71]Oh, there you go.
[20:02.70]This guy's also a Jedi.
[20:06.14]He's got a lightsaber.
[20:29.29]4,500 bucks.
[20:35.16]I love the, uh, I love the aesthetic of the whole game, too.
[20:38.92]I love the little, the blocky, uh, quest markers.
[20:41.08]Alright, I gotta actually pay attention here, because this is gonna be hard.
[20:44.08]First checkpoint.
[20:48.56]Oh, he didn't save!
[20:49.24]Fuck!
[20:49.74]I cut it off.
[20:56.12]What's this?
[20:57.29]Oh, shit!
[21:02.36]This is one of the superpowers.
[21:03.78]Get it!
[21:05.48]Am I even hurting anybody?
[21:06.51]Right down the row.
[21:17.81]Fuck!
[21:18.21]Fuck!
[21:19.17]Uh oh.
[21:19.53]Here we go.
[21:23.17]Here we do it.
[21:23.79]Let's do it again.
[21:27.47]They're blocking now.
[21:28.43]Smart.
[21:37.55]Thank you for playing this?
[21:39.01]I've been waiting.
[21:40.50]I've been waiting for a true announcement for No More Heroes 3 to get in here.
[21:45.94]What's this one?
[21:46.92]Oh, this is the crazy one.
[21:47.98]This is like the Super Saiyan one.
[21:53.52]Give me more people to hit!
[21:54.36]Come on!
[21:56.74]I think that's it.
[21:57.65]Yeah.
[22:00.27]I was very disappointed at the one that was announced for the Switch.
[22:06.50]It was that weird top-down one.
[22:08.40]I'm not going to say it's a bad game because I haven't played it.
[22:11.40]But I... It might be worth playing.
[22:21.48]I heard it's bad.
[22:24.44]I didn't hear it was bad.
[22:25.84]I just heard it was not great.
[22:31.85]I heard it was very passable.
[22:34.49]Very passable.
[22:35.99]In huge underline under the word very.
[22:42.17]Not perfect equals bad.
[22:44.35]No, no.

[28:01.62]You guys have seen me with my Wii U!
[28:03.96]I-I- What are you talking about?
[28:07.62]We already went over this yesterday!
[28:10.98]I've- I've shared photos of me with my Wii U!
[28:20.89]I wasn't here yesterday.
[28:21.81]Fuck!
[28:22.61]I'm sorry.
[28:23.05]Alright, let's get some health.
[28:25.19]Uh, what does this thing do?
[28:28.83]Oh, it's a new move!
[28:29.69]Right, that's the unlock moves.
[28:30.91]I forgot.
[28:34.18]Travis, do you remember those golden days in Calgary?
[28:37.88]The path of pro wrestling that you have long forgotten.
[28:41.95]If even a fragment of the spirit of a wrestler remains in your blood, remember the first suplex that your master taught you.
[28:48.52]Yes, that's right, the darkness piercing.
[28:50.78]Front neck chancery drop.
[28:56.84]You remembered an old wrestling move.
[29:07.49]Look, it's easy to miss.
[29:10.34]Trading card number five.
[29:11.90]Save the game.
[29:16.54]Travis the Suplex.
[29:20.29]Yeah, don't worry.
[29:20.91]There's no... You don't see anything.
[29:24.69]Those of you that want to tell me TOS, Death Stranding did this.
[29:28.23]And everything's fine.
[29:39.38]Like, there's literally, like, six-minute-long shower scenes with Sam Porter Bridges.
[29:46.25]I think I'll be alright.
[29:58.29]Did you say poop?
[30:02.13]Uh, you did.
[30:02.61]Alright, we're good.
[30:08.30]Are you guys ready?
[30:09.73]Are you ready?
[30:10.21]Are you ready to see, like, the real game?
[30:11.75]Let's go.
[30:12.15]Remember, this is not hard.
[30:25.03]No, it's not.
[30:25.55]I know.
[30:26.01]I'm just saying that so people think I'm cool.
[30:32.76]Quite beautiful, wouldn't you say?
[30:35.42]Paid for with the lives of many.
[30:39.28]When you have the strength to take life for yourself, that is true wealth.
[30:46.44]I am free of desire, so long as I have the scenery to look upon.
[30:51.45]Imagine having a pool ten feet away from a beach.
[30:56.67]You're the one leaving.
[30:58.27]In a body bag.
[31:01.01]I'll only say this once more.
[31:03.20]Leave here now!
[31:05.34]Huh.
[31:06.18]Me leave?
[31:07.46]You obviously don't know me.
[31:09.26]You don't get it, do you?
[31:13.40]Hey, you know what Paradise is, right?
[31:16.57]Paradise?
[31:18.91]This is Paradise.
[31:20.41]The place where dreams are fulfilled.
[31:21.93]You don't know me.
[31:22.93]Well, you've had your dream, old man.
[31:25.51]Time to wake up.
[31:26.67]This is no Paradise.
[31:29.78]Alright.
[31:30.58]Then what is it?
[31:33.20]A place to die.
[31:35.04]Whoa, covered in tattoos.
[31:36.50]I'm glad you and I are on the same page here.
[31:38.81]What kind of lightsaber do you have?
[31:40.51]That's this game.
[31:43.63]It was cool.
[31:44.35]You have no idea, do you?
[31:46.77]What a pity.
[31:48.03]You make an old man cry.
[31:52.25]Arrogant, crude little shits like you come around from time to time.
[31:57.84]Listen well, young one.
[31:59.98]The wall is high, higher than you will ever know.
[32:04.38]Ultimate sacrifice is supplied.
[32:11.89]Now draw.
[32:15.01]You can take that to your grave.
[32:18.21]No, I got, I got, I got Luke's lightsaber.
[32:20.97]You can't fight me with that shit.
[32:22.97]Here we go!
[32:31.86]This count.
[32:33.18]I feel as if I'm looking at my future self.
[32:36.02]Make a box.
[32:36.98]Big ass box.
[32:38.42]Stop it!
[32:41.00]A trusty nutritionist counting every calorie.
[32:45.59]What is he talking about?
[32:47.41]Get that shit out of here.
[32:49.35]Ow.
[33:15.66]That'll be my life.
[33:17.97]I thirst for selflessness.
[33:22.89]Young rookies like me.
[33:24.77]This is how it goes down.
[33:26.73]And for the old.
[33:27.61]Get him, get him, get him.
[33:33.94]I realize there's really nothing here.
[33:36.32]Keep going.
[33:39.89]He's still fucking talking before I bail I
[34:08.83]Fuck, he's gonna kill me.
[34:11.19]He's gonna kill me!
[34:15.20]He's got me in a combo!
[34:16.88]Alright, slow down.
[34:19.82]My battery!
[34:21.64]My battery!
[34:22.52]My battery's dead!
[34:23.98]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[34:39.55]Back it up, back it up, back it up.
[34:41.99]It's all up high for that one.
[34:52.11]Hit it again.
[34:56.29]Suplex.
[35:03.92]Oh god.
[35:06.06]Which one's the real one?
[35:07.44]One in the middle?
[35:15.53]That's the right one No it's this one here
[35:42.88]He doesn't know Pepe hands.
[35:45.44]Well, I don't, I... I actually don't know.
[35:47.94]I don't remember.
[35:48.52]If I take, like, two or three more hits, I'm gonna die.
[36:05.67]Got it.
[36:06.85]Okay, two more.
[36:13.24]He's gonna lose to the first boss?
[36:20.30]Why am I reading chat right now?
[36:21.58]Just leave me alone.
[36:25.19]Alright, I need battery.
[36:32.51]I'm gonna wait till he swings.
[36:46.90]I need health.
[36:48.02]Well, I gotta get health.
[36:49.02]I think there's one in here.
[36:52.34]Holy fuck.
[36:53.38]Wasn't very much, but it's enough.
[36:54.58]Health?
[36:56.45]Yeah.
[37:14.36]Fuck, I just dodged.
[37:17.90]Easy.
[37:18.08]Just don't die.
[37:20.22]I'll be fine.
[37:45.22]How many hits is that?
[37:46.74]Uh-oh.
[37:51.67]Got derounded.
[37:52.61]I didn't need to do that.
[37:53.71]What the fuck am I doing?
[38:00.65]He's dead.
[38:02.46]Got him.
[38:05.78]See you later.
[38:08.44]Completed the tutorial.
[38:09.56]Great job.
[38:10.14]That's the easiest thing in the whole game.
[38:19.64]Extraordinary.
[38:21.24]The moment I've been waiting for.
[38:23.40]The name Holy Sword is now yours.
[38:28.42]You're joking, right?
[38:29.92]I don't care about titles or power.
[38:32.38]I just want to be number one.
[38:34.20]Then master the ways of the assassin.
[38:36.54]I'm now number ten.
[38:46.55]Was this before Bayonetta?
[38:49.52]I think this is the first, like, real violent game that came out on the Wii, right?
[38:59.36]There it is.
[38:59.88]Rank B. That's alright.
[39:01.54]I'll take B, B, B. Total money?
[39:05.90]Cool.
[39:17.81]Open the chest, please.
[39:21.30]Wii Sports was really violent?
[39:24.20]Um, no, that's... Maximum Vitality Increase, nice.
[39:27.83]No, you're right.
[39:29.21]Wii Sports was very violent.
[39:31.55]You know how many people accidentally hit their friends in the face with the Wii Mode?
[39:34.77]That's the first time motion controls took off at all.
[39:37.89]You know how many TVs were fucking shattered?
[39:40.18]You know how many accidental elbows into your little brother's face there were?
[39:45.08]It's probably the most violent console to ever exist.
[39:48.74]Or ever will exist.
[39:51.06]How many ER trips from 2006 to, like, 2010 existed because of the Wii?
[39:58.76]That data is somewhere.
[39:59.54]Alright, is that all the, uh... yeah.
[40:11.80]Nice kill, Travis.
[40:13.60]I didn't think you had it in you.
[40:16.28]It was rather... exciting.
[40:20.59]Congratulations.
[40:21.97]There she is.
[40:22.57]You are now ranked tenth.
[40:24.35]Tenth, huh?
[40:25.51]What?
[40:26.17]Do I get anything?
[40:27.87]Hmm.
[40:28.89]How about some cash?
[40:30.55]That should help you pay the bills.
[40:33.49]I'm not feeling the sense of accomplishment that I should have.
[40:37.63]So I just gotta do this a few more times, right?
[40:40.66]If you so choose, yes.
[40:42.86]Ten more times, Travis.
[40:43.76]And you will keep your promise?
[40:45.72]There is nothing the Association cannot do.
[40:49.05]And if I refuse?
[40:51.13]As the 10th ranked assassin, you are now a target for those who want to replace you.
[40:57.24]Anytime, anywhere, number 11 could be right around the corner, ready to put a knife in your eye.
[41:06.54]So what you're telling me is that I gotta continue fighting.
[41:09.81]There's no way out of this.
[41:11.99]You set me up, bitch.
[41:13.83]Quit your bitching and get with the program.
[41:17.07]There's only one road out of here.
[41:19.33]No turning back.
[41:21.44]Okay, how about this?
[41:22.88]If I become number one, will you do it with me?
[41:27.28]Maybe.
[41:28.90]Maybe not.
[41:29.82]Come on, just once.
[41:35.87]I did it!
[41:40.16]Ranking list!
[41:41.20]Marvelous!
[41:48.98]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!
[41:52.75]Death Metal!
[41:54.03]Travis Touchdown takes over Death Metal.
[42:08.55]It was just Galaga this whole time.
[42:12.47]I believe this is where the world opens up.
[42:14.53]And yes, it is an open world game.
[42:16.05]Rank 10.
[42:29.10]Explore the house?
[42:29.82]Yeah, there's a lot of stuff here.
[42:35.56]Hmm.
[42:38.65]Time for chores.
[42:42.35]Time for chores.
[42:45.47]The open part, the open world part sucks.
[42:47.29]Yes, it does.
[42:47.80]He swallowed the gargle.
[43:06.96]It didn't swipe, it didn't, and swallowed gargle.
[43:14.06]Alright, let's do, uh, let's go to the closet.
[43:18.94]What do I got?
[43:19.70]You can change clothes and things, too.
[43:20.74]Alright, we'll go sunglasses.
[43:24.48]I only have the defaults, I think you can buy better ones.
[43:27.71]Uh, t-shirts.
[43:28.57]Alright, just go shirtless.
[43:34.31]I don't want the Kingdom Hearts box art.
[43:38.47]Whatever this is.
[43:39.05]Default.
[43:46.02]Default.
[43:49.34]That looks good.
[43:49.82]Let's go to the drawer.
[43:53.85]What's in here?
[43:54.57]I think you can look at your cards.
[43:58.13]Yeah, this is the Beam Katanas.
[43:59.39]This is where you keep your lightsabers.
[44:00.81]You have Blood Berry.
[44:03.14]Wanted at a net auction?
[44:08.68]Aviv Katana wanted an auction.
[44:10.18]Okay.

[44:25.70]Burger suplex.
[44:26.70]A burger joint with a distinctive sign.
[44:31.38]There's the house.
[44:31.98]Here's a suplex pizza.
[44:33.72]Atomic drop ward.
[44:35.60]Santa destroy high school.
[44:37.34]Body slam beach.
[44:38.78]Yeah, it's an open world.
[44:43.97]You don't skip.
[44:46.23]Skip what?
[44:49.57]Let's go play with the cat.
[44:53.83]Here we go.
[44:56.93]Yeah, you can play with the cat in this game.
[45:06.03]Get it!
[45:06.33]I'm gonna get that thing!
[45:09.46]I'm gonna get it!
[45:13.06]Alright, we got cards.
[45:18.58]What are the cards we got?
[45:23.31]Trading card.
[45:23.75]Mask of the Legendary Wrestler.
[45:25.79]El Extremo.
[45:28.86]Yeah, they're just wrestlers.
[45:31.46]I did get all the cards in that level.
[45:32.52]That's cool.
[45:35.42]Look at this room.
[45:36.16]Alright, what about the fridge?
[45:38.22]What's in the fridge?
[45:39.68]It's a mini fridge.

[45:41.60]Alright, what about TV?
[45:51.61]No More Heroes.
[45:52.43]The first trailer of No More Heroes.
[45:55.41]Should we watch it?
[45:56.47]I think we already saw this.
[45:57.39]Did we see this?
[46:00.01]He's got a wicked bad nerd neck.
[46:13.44]This is the trailer for the...
[46:20.34]This is the Helter Skelter.
[46:21.34]Yeah.
[46:22.42]Skelter, Helter, whatever his name is.
[46:26.42]You don't see this fight.
[46:42.97]Helter Skelter.
[46:45.67]It is Helter Skelter.
[46:52.34]This is spoilers?
[46:53.46]Is it?
[46:53.68]No, this is the trailer for- this is like the official licensed Nintendo trailer for the game.
[47:04.94]Actual spoilers.
[47:07.65]Is it spoilers?
[47:13.87]Alright, we won't watch it then.
[47:20.09]Not spoil it.
[47:20.57]It's alright.
[47:20.99]You already saw it.
[47:22.53]It's not.
[47:23.01]Why?
[47:23.23]I don't know.
[47:24.01]Fucking one guy.
[47:25.13]Alright, let's go.
[47:32.63]Let's play the worst part of the entire video game.
[47:35.49]But it being pulled through a PC might actually be better.
[47:41.47]Because this is the segment that... This is the reason why I didn't play it on the Wii.
[47:46.99]This right here is the reason why.
[47:50.39]What you're about to see.
[47:59.37]Hmm.
[48:04.36]That ain't bad right now.
[48:05.72]That ain't bad.
[48:06.22]How do I back up?
[48:18.21]You watched a shitty Coke ad for this.
[48:19.89]For what?
[48:20.23]Oh, I guess that just answered you, like, for what?
[48:24.63]The next fight has been arranged.
[48:26.77]You don't have a lot of time, so I'll just tell you what you need to know.
[48:31.15]The ninth ranked assassin is currently Dr. Peace.
[48:35.86]A doctor?
[48:36.48]Dr. Peace?
[48:37.60]Actually, a detective.
[48:39.24]A dirty and unscrupulous detective with plenty of dark secrets about him.
[48:43.76]Illegal investigations, illicit sales, black marketing.
[48:47.74]He is your one-stop shop for marketing illegal goods.
[48:51.55]And on top of that, he is a trained assassin.
[48:54.19]He's been doing some work for the mafia.
[48:56.23]And before you know it, he's up there ranked ninth on the list.
[48:59.99]To be Frank, he's good.
[49:01.73]You won't stand a chance against him.
[49:03.93]You're as good as dead.
[49:05.61]What's it going to be, cowboy?
[49:07.11]Put me in, coach.
[49:09.20]Alright, please transfer 150,000 LB dollars.
[49:14.92]What?
[49:15.80]150,000 LBs?
[49:16.78]Your entry fee, my overhead costs.
[49:20.12]Don't tell me that you were not expecting so many zeros on that price or that I am ripping you off or some shit.
[49:25.67]We have an elite staff in the thousands.
[49:27.97]Personally, I think it's a bargain.
[49:30.73]Okay, I gotcha.
[49:32.63]But you really think I got that kind of dough on me?
[49:35.59]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[49:37.50]This outfit.
[49:38.16]Coconut time.
[49:38.86]What?
[49:39.04]Ah!
[50:08.38]That's the scream.
[50:09.26]There it is.
[50:12.53]What a distinctive voice.
[50:14.35]You can take on assassin missions from K Entertainment.
[50:17.63]Earn enough money to enter the next ranking battle.
[50:22.67]So here's your open world.
[50:27.12]Not much of an open world.
[50:28.34]It's kind of just a map to go do things.
[50:30.14]But yeah, we'll just do this.
[50:31.86]Make some money.
[50:34.92]Go do the facial.
[50:36.26]I can't.
[50:37.71]Hello, Travis.
[50:41.49]Members only, we only need high-ranking assassins.
[50:44.94]If you don't have an introduction ticket, please leave now.
[50:47.38]We only offer work to those who have proven themselves as hard workers.
[50:50.62]May you find your true path.
[50:52.12]I'm not good enough.
[51:01.62]Now apparently not skilled.
[51:04.45]The job center is now open.
[51:06.27]You can take on part-time job missions from the job center.
[51:09.97]Earn enough money to enter the next battle.
[51:12.95]Press the 1 button to call your bike.
[51:14.87]Sit next to your bike and press the A button to get on.
[51:17.11]Yep, yep, yep.
[51:18.69]Press 2 to change the minimap's display.
[51:20.59]Let's get the bike here.
[51:27.67]Yeah, you have to actually go do...
[51:31.03]Just part-time.
[51:32.13]Travis!
[51:33.55]Who the fuck is this?
[51:34.19]Alright, give me a sec.
[51:37.52]I have to let Otto, uh... Let me let Otto out of the room.
[51:41.09]Hold on, he must get up.
[52:14.12]I'll tell you, you can't be in here.
[52:15.30]Well, he wanted to get out.
[52:16.68]He was like, let me out, Jeremy.
[52:18.15]I was like, okay.
[52:20.35]He wants to get out.
[52:22.65]So he can leave.
[52:24.07]He's free to roam where he pleases.
[52:25.47]Alright, let's go.
[52:28.53]Get on a bike.
[52:30.94]Here's the real test.
[52:37.94]It runs so much better.
[52:38.92]Go!
[52:41.95]Let's go check out the jobs.
[52:42.78]I mean, it's still pretty janky, but those of you that played the original, actual original hardware, this was horrible.
[52:53.33]This is way better.
[52:54.57]Yeah, like by, probably by 10,000%.
[53:11.99]Let's go to the job center.
[53:15.05]Which is... another sock.
[53:16.83]Oh.
[53:18.77]Get off.
[53:21.92]The sharp turns are fun, though.
[53:23.22]Yeah, they can be.
[53:24.80]How much money do I have right now?
[53:25.72]There's no blood in the Japanese version.
[53:33.46]Really?
[53:34.55]Why are you here, Third Raider?
[53:35.95]This is a place where Third Raiders get together.
[53:39.31]So you're a member.
[53:40.71]Well, I'll teach you some good stuff.
[53:42.75]All First Raiders in the world were once Third Raiders.
[53:46.15]So Third Class is the first step up the ladder.
[53:49.05]First Class.
[53:49.69]Your life will change if you work here.
[53:51.99]I'll tell you one more thing.
[53:53.42]How do Third Raiders become First Raiders?
[53:55.72]It's easy.
[53:56.64]They work their damn butts off till they were puking blood.
[53:59.82]And then work some more.
[54:01.44]Wanna be a First Raider?
[54:02.60]Alright, just work hard.
[54:05.13]Chalk up jobs to survive in this town.
[54:07.53]I'll hook you up with some more work if you do this job well.
[54:10.63]The job has been posted on the Bolden Board.
[54:14.45]Just work hard.
[54:15.89]Here it is, coconut collector.
[54:18.30]Collect coconuts for form of rolling Sobat against a palm tree to make coconuts fall.
[54:25.08]Here we go, $2,000 for each delivery.
[54:30.83]This part of the game sucks, but I'm gonna enjoy it because it's nostalgia taken over.
[54:46.58]Okay, head to the client point marked on the map.
[54:50.38]Let's go.
[54:55.34]I think, yeah, if I smack the Wii... No, not smack the Wii.
[54:58.81]If I... I think I can go faster if I double tap and then like... Oh, that's jump.
[55:08.66]Just like in GTA.
[55:09.92]Here we are.
[55:10.38]We're here.
[55:12.12]You can drift too, yeah.
[55:17.99]Wow, Jeremy, this is such an interesting Minecraft house.
[55:21.49]Thanks, Mom.
[55:23.59]The unspoken rules of Santa Destroy are okay, but the coconuts of Santa Destroy are more my thing.
[55:28.88]Coconuts from these parts fetch a high price.
[55:31.24]This town is built on coconuts.
[55:33.50]Coconuts are worth more than human life.
[55:35.82]Coconuts are God, so gather them now.
[55:39.49]Gather coconuts and give them to the storekeeper.
[55:42.05]Use combo attacks on the palm trees to make the coconuts fall.
[55:45.29]Press the A button repeatedly when carrying coconuts to walk faster.
[55:48.78]Here we go.
[56:00.26]Hit me in the fucking head.
[56:04.28]Get the coconut.
[56:06.70]How many can you hold?
[56:07.32]One or two?
[56:10.03]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[56:18.98]That's the way!
[56:19.60]Any more in this tree?
[56:26.14]Nope.
[56:29.58]No, no, no, I gotta... This is a strand game?
[56:45.03]That makes no sense.
[56:46.99]Alright, I gotta get three at a time.
[56:51.58]Get in front of it, please.
[56:53.20]Oh my god.
[56:56.74]What the fuck is going on?
[56:58.42]Why can't I hit that one?
[57:02.06]What?
[57:08.36]No, don't pick this one up.
[57:09.24]I want the... Whatever.
[57:18.91]Still away.
[57:23.06]I want to get like two or three of them to drop.
[57:24.56]Let's do this.
[57:26.32]No.
[57:28.88]There we go.
[57:31.36]Grab him.
[57:37.53]I get two thousand bucks for each one of these.
[57:53.51]Still got a full minute.
[57:55.33]More than 15 or 10 is good.
[57:57.05]Okay, nothing on that one.
[57:57.97]Nothing on that one.
[58:00.69]Nothing on that one.
[58:05.69]Come on.
[58:08.31]Come on!
[58:21.94]Coconut brain.
[58:25.94]I should be able to do two more deliveries.
[58:41.39]The other side, the closer trees, right?
[58:43.26]Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.
[58:59.88]I got 11.
[59:01.65]That's like a shitload of money. $22,000.
[59:13.26]That's a gold rank.
[59:14.20]That's not like a silver rank.
[59:15.38]I just got a gold rank.
[59:16.24]I can get platinum rank.
[59:17.42]I'm gonna do that one again.
[59:19.16]Hey, you third grader.
[59:20.10]I've got another job for you.
[59:21.36]Something a little shadier, perhaps, but work all the same.
[59:24.44]I've sent an introduction ticket to my associate.
[59:27.37]The road to becoming a first grader is long and hard.
[59:29.33]Get your ass in gear.
[59:32.31]Hey, you third grader.
[59:34.41]You want to be a... That doesn't make any sense.
[59:36.51]Hey, you third grader.
[59:37.49]Want to be a first grader?
[59:40.27]Oh, nice.
[59:40.67]Okay, an assassination mission.
[59:42.88]A brand new Free Fight mission can now be selected.
[59:53.04]It's time to kick some ass.
[59:54.85]Free Fights suck.
[59:56.87]It's better than carrying coconuts.
[60:00.65]Here's a list of jobs in my current rank.
[60:02.19]Here we go.
[60:02.59]Assassination Gig 1.
[60:04.03]Pizza Butt.
[60:05.57]Chain restaurant Pizza Butt plans to open up and send a destroyer to crush their plans.
[60:09.22]Kill Pizza Butt's CEO.
[60:12.80]Or a snake hole.
[60:13.90]Kill until you die.
[60:15.18]Mission ends when your life runs out.
[60:18.93]Two thousand.
[60:19.63]Thirty thousand dollars!
[60:21.47]Do this one.
[60:26.05]I could do this one clean.
[60:38.35]Kill someone, $30,000.
[60:38.93]Collect 11 coconuts, $22,000.
[60:39.55]Yeah.
[60:39.69]Alright, speed it up.
[60:40.11]I didn't even hit that guy.
[61:14.78]These corners.
[61:16.40]You can't just turn on a... Let me just try to hold... Yeah.
[61:22.15]Z is boost?
[61:26.25]Yes, it is.
[61:27.49]Yes, it is.
[61:28.73]It is boost.
[61:29.77]You got it.
[61:40.88]Where is it?
[61:41.18]Right here?
[61:41.48]On the other side?
[61:42.14]I don't think I can jump over this.
[61:44.53]Can I?
[61:48.96]Shit, I gotta go down there.
[62:02.02]Alright, that's how you do it.
[62:03.44]That's how you do it.
[62:03.96]You go really fast and you can instantly stop.
[62:07.26]I forget how I just did that.
[62:12.06]Oh, shit.
[62:12.56]Okay.
[62:12.96]I wish I had some sourdough pizza.
[62:17.80]That sounds, like, bad.
[62:21.26]Is that actually good?
[62:28.39]Sourdough pizza?
[62:31.95]Wouldn't it be too chewy and weird?
[62:33.91]Alright, let's go.
[62:35.09]This is my favorite part of the whole game.
[62:42.19]That part.
[62:46.47]We all got it now.
[62:56.85]Just fucking burn the void.
[62:57.80]Oh, no, no, no, don't burn the void, Technique.
[62:59.48]Get them all!
[63:05.34]Oh, do it sideways, goddammit, I would've had like five people.
[63:20.78]Shit.
[63:23.66]Ow, they're shooting guns at me.
[63:30.79]I have 10 seconds, I gotta kill them.
[63:44.13]Get over here, get over here, get over here, get over here.
[63:45.63]Come on, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[63:53.12]I didn't even forgot about the time, forgot about the time.
[63:59.01]Alright, let's do it again, let's do it again, let's do it again, let's do it again.
[64:05.32]Oh, shit, I forgot, I forgot, you have to go get, you have to, ow, I forgot!
[64:09.42]I forgot, that's the worst part about this game, you have to go get it again.
[64:11.81]Okay, you gotta go back and get it again.
[64:13.71]Fuck, I forgot about this part.
[64:15.35]That part, this part sucks.
[64:16.23]Yeah, this part is the worst.
[64:23.62]You actually have to go get the mission again.
[64:24.90]Excuse me.
[64:29.38]Jesus Christ.
[64:37.71]Damn it, I forgot about that.
[64:38.82]Yeah, you can't mess around.
[64:41.00]If I had only swung left to right, if I was able to swing left to right, that would have been perfect.
[64:50.93]I'll get it this time.
[64:56.93]I think I hit that lady, I guess.
[65:09.76]Kick the dumpsters?
[65:10.71]Oh yeah, that's right.
[65:11.31]You can kick the dumpsters.
[65:13.45]Which side is this on?
[65:14.07]This side.
[65:20.03]Oh, shit.
[65:21.31]I almost had it.
[65:21.97]Alright, I gotta be real quick with this.
[65:23.64]You only have 30 seconds.
[65:24.54]Welcome, Travis.
[65:32.08]Uh-huh.
[65:39.90]Pizza butt.
[65:40.52]Let's go.
[65:40.90]I bet you can't do this in 30 seconds.
[65:50.32]I will do this in 30 seconds.
[65:51.62]I promise.
[65:56.94]Don't forget to use the charge attacks.
[65:58.93]Do I have those?
[65:59.89]Do you have to unlock those?
[66:07.30]Alright, let's do it.
[66:08.38]Straight down here.
[66:11.58]Down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[66:27.17]Pizza butter.
[66:41.06]Alright.
[66:42.15]This is the one.
[66:45.07]Better ingredients, better pizza.
[66:46.93]Pizza butt.
[66:51.81]30 seconds.
[66:52.23]Don't fuck around.
[66:52.83]Go right in.
[66:53.51]Go right in and kill everybody.
[67:04.02]Hurry.
[67:04.48]Quick.
[67:04.74]Get in.
[67:05.12]Go.
[67:05.28]Go.
[67:11.94]That's what I wanted, right there.
[67:14.93]This is the one.
[67:22.58]Left or right?
[67:22.98]Left or right?
[67:23.36]Left or right?
[67:23.80]Ah!
[67:40.16]Jerma Suplex right in his neck.
[67:43.00]Dead.
[67:52.63]Just kill the dude?
[67:53.41]Yeah, but if you kill... you get bonuses if you kill more people.
[67:57.49]I got a bronze for that, because I didn't kill everybody.
[68:02.77]If you got time, kill everybody.
[68:09.74]You have enough money for the entrance fee for the next ranking battle.
[68:12.62]Make the payment at an ATM.
[68:13.58]I got $158,000.
[68:15.30]Buy shirts and stuff.
[68:30.85]Yeah, but one of the things that happens to you in this game, in this whole series, is you'll have enough money to do the next entrance to the assassination, that you'll buy like five t-shirts and have to collect coconuts for two hours.
[68:44.92]I didn't even hit you.
[68:59.03]Do it anyways.
[69:06.46]$2,000 in that one?
[69:07.54]$2,000 in that one?
[69:13.04]Why would you throw $2,000 away?
[69:17.16]A basketball?
[69:17.78]What is that?
[69:18.14]I found a Lovikov ball.
[69:22.73]What the hell?
[69:23.13]What is that?
[69:23.51]I don't remember that.
[69:25.63]Huh?
[69:39.89]Give me my bike.
[69:43.75]Dumpster diving?
[69:44.89]Yeah.
[69:45.97]It's a Japanese game, right?
[69:47.05]So that's... that's like 20 bucks.
[69:51.98]Is it?
[69:52.16]Alright, let's make the deposit.
[70:00.68]A car?
[70:15.58]Is he actually using a Wii controller?
[70:17.85]You saying?
[70:20.19]Yes, I am.
[70:20.95]$150,000 deposit.
[70:27.37]Why am I using a Wii controller?
[70:29.58]Because I have to.
[70:33.52]This game has like a gyro feature that has the up and down and left and right swinging and... You just hit the mic.
[70:45.98]Just threw a wad into the ATM.
[70:47.70]Alright, I'm good.
[70:54.86]Can you please turn up your mic volume?
[71:04.25]Uh... It should be up.
[71:06.65]Is that better?
[71:12.53]Can you hear me now?
[71:13.73]Can you hear me now?
[71:14.31]Can you hear me now?
[71:17.95]Your mic is fine.
[71:18.61]I just got hurt.
[71:22.38]Alright, where did I have to go?
[71:23.18]I was looking at chat.
[71:27.02]Back to the house, right?
[71:27.72]And answer the phone.
[71:34.94]My home is inside of... Get out of the way.
[71:39.48]My house is the hotel.
[71:40.56]I forgot.
[71:51.41]I know the mic isn't muted.
[71:53.99]Yeah, bring that shit back to, like, 2013 Twitch.
[71:56.79]Oh, wait, what's this?
[72:02.73]Preparing.
[72:05.37]Oh, it's not open yet, right?
[72:07.87]It's not open yet.
[72:16.02]Why?
[72:16.20]Did I just go in the... Fuck.
[72:27.89]Look at chat.
[72:28.43]You're muted.
[72:29.11]Why?
[72:30.41]Oh, yeah.
[72:30.71]You want me to prove I'm not muted?
[72:34.73]You guys could be like, oh, just don't say anything.
[72:36.51]Just don't react to anything that he says.
[72:38.25]Really?
[72:38.85]You think you can keep that up?
[72:42.50]Hmm.
[72:45.16]I wonder if you can keep that up.
[72:56.76]Uh-oh.
[72:59.40]The Witcher 3 is not a good game.
[73:13.71]See?
[73:14.61]I told you.
[73:15.89]I told you.
[73:16.49]Just say something.
[73:18.44]We're actually... That's wrong.
[73:19.82]You're wrong.
[73:21.42]Yeah.
[73:23.40]You're not a very good at... You're not a very good stealth artist.
[73:30.60]Hey Travis, the next fight has been prepared.
[73:34.26]Destroy stadium.
[73:35.86]Dr. Peace is waiting for you.
[73:38.19]Hop to it.
[73:38.71]I never even played The Witcher 3.
[73:44.76]I know it's supposed to be legendary, but let me tell you something.
[73:47.91]I played The Witcher 1, and didn't get it.
[73:51.11]And I was like, oh, this is kind of cool, I guess.
[73:53.79]And gave up on, I think it was The Witcher 2, after two hours of playing it, because every time you opened a door in The Witcher 2, you had to sit at a loading screen for two to three straight minutes every single time.
[74:07.02]So I was like, I don't want to play this game.
[74:11.68]I think eventually they fixed all that.
[74:16.65]But I've never played them, really.
[74:18.03]I've played a little bit of them.
[74:20.29]Maybe I've got to go back and give it a chance.
[74:22.01]Because I've heard they are fantastic.
[74:26.69]Save the cat.
[74:27.49]The cat is fine.
[74:37.29]Wait, there's other... What are the controls?
[74:41.48]Oh, any button.
[74:45.71]We're just vibing right now, right?
[74:49.56]Which one didn't age well?
[74:53.44]That was back when it was almost like a rhythm game, right?
[74:58.10]Wasn't the combat you had to click, try to click, click, click, click?
[75:02.35]It was weird.
[75:03.73]It was different.
[75:05.87]You had to time your clicks almost like it was a rhythm game.
[75:12.85]I remember not hating that, though.
[75:15.41]I thought it was interesting.
[75:16.23]Alright, let me get healed.
[75:26.67]Three's not like that?
[75:27.57]Yeah, I know.
[75:29.15]Maybe one day I'll give it all a chance and play it all.
[75:33.49]Because, you know, I don't want to, look, I don't want to be one of those bandwagon assholes that plays Cyberpunk and goes, wow, what an incredible studio.
[75:41.67]Oh, I'm such a fan.
[75:42.77]Been such a fan for so long.
[75:44.23]What a great studio.
[75:45.20]I love this studio.
[75:47.74]And, like, I played 10 minutes of The Witcher and I was like, I don't like this.
[75:52.36]What's this studio?
[75:53.10]What's this timing stuff?
[75:55.52]Whoa.
[75:56.86]Cyberpunk.
[75:58.24]Wow.
[76:00.46]Who made this?
[76:01.54]Oh.
[76:04.28]Alright, I need to go... No, I'm not putting a shirt on.
[76:06.08]There's nothing else I can do.
[76:11.94]I didn't unlock anything.
[76:13.34]I'm going to save it, though.
[76:16.28]It's freaking me out.
[76:16.88]Is it weird that I have to go to the bathroom every time I see him do this?
[76:27.10]Like, it makes me need to pee.
[76:30.08]That's weird.
[76:38.15]Do I have any messages or anything on the telephone?
[76:45.19]Alright, let's go.
[76:47.11]Bye, Gene.
[76:55.05]Is this game on Steam?
[76:55.97]It is not.
[76:57.48]Unfortunately, I don't know why, Ranking Battle 9 is now open.
[77:04.57]So, this is Grasshopper and Ubisoft, right?
[77:07.85]Ubisoft, I believe, has the rights to this game.
[77:11.21]This is an Ubisoft published game.
[77:17.14]With No More Heroes 3 coming out, you'd think that they would... I'm surprised there's not a...
[77:28.82]Hey, No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2.
[77:31.21]Remastered.
[77:32.07]Coming out before, right?
[77:33.43]I feel like they would have to do that.
[77:36.57]Because they did a port for PS3.
[77:38.27]It was one game.
[77:39.29]It was this one.
[77:40.39]They ported it to PS3.
[77:41.48]They didn't do the second one.
[77:42.42]The second one's still only on Wii.
[77:45.54]It's just kind of all over the place.
[77:46.58]It would be nice to have it in one spot that was remastered.
[77:52.05]I think they were actually talking about remastering them or porting them or something.
[77:55.71]But it was like an offhanded random comment in an interview that I think that Suda did a lot, like a year ago.
[78:01.99]Right?
[78:03.01]Like, yeah, we would love to do that!
[78:04.97]But not like, real.
[78:06.89]Like, we're going to do that.
[78:07.89]I think it would be in their best interest though, because some people would buy it.
[78:23.68]Two is better than one.
[78:26.68]Uh, two... Two is definitely cleaner than one.
[78:31.87]They fixed all the kind of annoying bullshit that is in this game.
[78:35.93]But I still think this game's really good.
[78:37.87]I still like this one.
[78:41.89]Alright, we go.
[78:44.61]Yeah, they're all good, yeah.
[78:53.79]Dr. Peace.
[78:59.43]There it is!
[79:00.13]Oh, I'm sorry!
[79:03.29]I'm sorry!
[79:05.48]I knew that was gonna happen.
[79:06.82]I knew it was gonna happen.
[79:07.96]Kill him!
[79:12.04]You knew it was gonna happen at least once.
[79:28.67]Oh yeah, these guys are all baseball players, I remember.
[79:31.33]Not when I wasn't walking low!
[79:36.29]Anyway, break.
[79:38.65]Two had better bosses, but the story was bland.
[79:58.68]Looks like the story in 3 might be pretty cool.
[80:05.56]If that trailer was any indicator, it's gonna be fucking crazy.
[80:11.38]Although the story, does the story really matter that much in a game like this?
[80:14.18]You know what I'm saying?
[80:17.66]It's just fun.
[80:19.06]And it's just an interesting concept.
[80:23.05]It does.
[80:24.65]Well, to an extent I would say yeah, but...
[80:28.31]You're an assassin, you're climbing the assassin ladder That's all the info that I need to have fun
[80:48.04]He's backtracking.
[80:49.88]Wait, what?
[80:50.70]Because I don't think the story matters for me in this game.
[80:55.44]How's that backtracking?
[80:56.68]I still stand by that.
[81:01.59]Backtracking.
[81:02.87]Oh, backtracking Barry at it again.
[81:08.35]I don't think the story matters in this game.
[81:10.19]Looks over at chat.
[81:11.34]Fucking, what are you talking about?
[81:12.60]You idiot, stupid.
[81:13.64]Whoa, is he serious?
[81:15.26]No way.
[81:15.80]Oh, I'm gonna unfollow.
[81:17.38]Well, you know, the thing is, if you think the story's cool, then that's fine.
[81:21.96]But I don't, I mean, I think the story's cool.
[81:23.54]I just don't, I mean, for me, personally, my personal opinion.
[81:34.55]Unfollowed and reported.
[81:35.85]Wait, did I get everything?
[81:39.69]I mean, just the story in general... I'm not gonna be backtracking Barry anymore, alright?
[81:46.18]I love this game's atmosphere and this game's setting and this game's whole thing that's going on.
[81:51.20]I'm not gonna be backtracking Barry anymore.
[81:54.86]I'm just telling you.
[81:55.50]I love Travis.
[81:59.59]I keep backpedaling.
[82:02.69]I misspoke.
[82:03.65]I really did.
[82:04.39]Let me correct my gap.
[82:07.32]This game is fucking awesome, and the setting- FUCK!
[82:10.18]I'm- This is like my favorite game made for the Wii.
[82:17.81]Like, one of my favorite games- one of my favorite franchises.
[82:20.41]What am I supposed to say?
[82:32.12]Get outta here!
[82:37.10]Strawberry on the shortcake.
[82:53.51]Can I turn up the music?
[82:56.78]No, I can't.
[82:58.36]If I turn the music down and I turn it back up, I'll be backtracking on that too.
[83:07.55]Oh, wait a minute.
[83:10.21]Oh, this is... I remember this part.
[83:12.55]You gotta... Hit the ball.
[83:17.13]Controls.
[83:18.11]Hold up the Wiimote to prepare the beam katana.
[83:22.02]Swing the Wiimote like a bat.
[83:23.58]Hit the ball and send it flying.
[83:25.70]The strength of your swing will affect the speed of the ball.
[83:28.04]Hit the ball to defeat enemies.
[83:29.66]Three balls will be thrown.
[83:41.06]I thought I was gonna get it first try.
[83:43.56]I'm scared to do it hard.
[83:47.76]Because I don't want to hit you.
[83:50.00]Fuck, I'm gonna pee my pants.
[83:55.92]I don't know what it is about peeing, but... I just, I drink a lot of liquids.
[84:02.58]I'll do it at the same point.
[84:11.69]Backpedaling.
[84:12.35]No.
[84:12.97]Alright.
[84:15.15]You know that I like a game when, like, I won't go to the bathroom.
[84:18.33]I'm like a fucking three-year-old.
[84:22.39]That's a lot of money.
[84:28.02]Yes!
[84:28.72]I am!
[84:51.47]Show off the charge attack?
[84:53.67]I don't think I... I'm not sure I have it.
[84:55.31]I'll try.
[84:55.67]Does it have to be a full battery?
[84:59.11]Yeah, I'm not sure I have it.
[85:09.72]Oh, I do!
[85:13.02]Oh, it took a lot of battery.
[85:33.34]That's actually pretty cool.
[85:34.60]Losing a lot of battery.
[85:36.72]Nice.
[85:40.86]This is a lot of battery, though.
[85:45.56]Do some wrestling finishers.
[85:46.62]I only have one wrestling finisher at the moment.
[85:54.04]Or I think maybe two.
[85:57.70]Did I get all the goodies?
[85:59.14]I believe I did.
[86:07.46]Turn on the webcam for one of those.
[86:10.40]I'll do it eventually.
[86:11.50]Get them both!
[86:20.29]Yes!
[86:39.30]there he is come on knock him out low low high high high high high boom bang boom
[87:10.36]Uh, somebody said I should play Lollipop Chainsaw.
[87:19.98]I... But, here's the problem, though.
[87:23.77]I love No More Heroes.
[87:25.89]Am I going to judge Lollipop Chainsaw unfairly because of how much I love these games?
[87:35.19]I probably will.
[87:36.99]Alright, let's get in one go.
[87:41.96]I know how to do it.
[87:42.46]I'm standing back for this.
[87:49.69]Holy shit!
[87:50.59]I almost just peed.
[87:52.67]I almost did.
[87:56.53]Oh my god, I almost just peed.
[87:57.70]I swear to god.
[88:15.19]Yeah, I'll be right back.
[88:17.83]That came out.
[88:18.35]That ball was thrown so fast.
[88:20.98]I gotta check.
[91:00.44]Okay.
[91:01.86]Damn.
[91:06.23]Alright.
[91:09.43]He really did pee his pants.
[91:10.53]No.
[91:13.89]That's not why that took a little while.
[91:15.13]It's because there was a lot in there.
[91:25.08]Oh, I didn't pee my pants!
[91:28.23]I would tell you guys that.
[91:29.19]Do you think I would hold that information from you?
[91:33.21]Of all the strange things you've heard me say, you think me telling you I didn't pee my pants... You think I'm going to lie about that?
[91:46.00]Please don't tell us that.
[91:51.59]Oh, yeah.
[91:52.11]Probably shouldn't.
[91:55.35]Yeah, I probably shouldn't.
[92:02.42]Aw.
[92:02.56]Backtrack.
[92:03.78]Alright, this is going to be tricky.
[92:07.79]Aw, I thought I timed it.
[92:09.47]Damn it.
[92:38.94]Distracting?
[92:40.40]What does that even mean?
[92:43.38]Pee Pants Peter.
[92:49.19]Relax.
[92:55.20]Whoa, camera.
[92:58.46]Oh, I got him.
[93:12.73]Where am I?
[93:14.57]What?
[93:14.95]Oh, shit!
[93:15.53]I had a chance!
[93:22.20]Proof of peeing your pants.
[93:25.30]You can't prove somebody peed their pants by... I muted my mic and left the room.
[93:32.93]Show your pants.
[93:36.41]But how do you know I didn't change my pants?
[93:42.99]I could have paused and come back with new pants on.
[93:45.47]I said, exactly.
[93:49.42]Yeah, but... Then why would I need to turn on my webcam and show you my pants?
[93:56.48]Oh, there's nothing in here.
[93:57.92]I gotta charge this.
[94:11.03]Get them both!
[94:11.99]I got one.
[94:12.39]Alright.
[94:13.69]Stop using up my battery!
[94:14.87]Get off!
[94:16.45]What is this?
[94:21.02]What are you doing?
[94:36.53]Alright, you- you- When I look over here sometimes and I see a sea of clickable purple links, I get nervous.
[94:43.85]It's you peeing your pants.
[95:08.95]No, it's me.
[95:10.15]I know that I don't even know I don't have to click it.
[95:11.86]I know what it is Let me explain to everybody that keeps putting that image in for the last like two or three months There's such things guys as like mustard and Oil and eating at a restaurant and putting your finger on your pants after you eat like a pulled pork sandwich
[95:39.80]why would I pee my pants and what who cares no stop talking about food this I'm not this is not gonna be an hour and 25 minute stream every time you talk about food it all gets up no stop saying no I got diarrhea last night from the pizza so don't I'm not I don't want that that's not gonna work
[96:10.93]The worst part about this is I don't know if it was the pizza or putting the Wiimote in my mouth.
[96:16.32]True story.
[96:19.74]Fuck.
[96:40.65]Two lightsaber duels.
[96:45.95]Shit, that hurts.
[96:55.74]Get him, boy!
[96:57.32]Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[96:58.92]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[97:02.00]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
[97:06.64]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
[97:08.90]That's it.
[97:16.03]I got everything, right?
[97:31.06]Psycho.
[97:32.52]Why?
[97:32.62]Because I was going kill, kill, kill, kill.
[97:35.82]Alright, let's see if this works.
[97:40.48]Can you guys hear it?
[97:41.12]Let's find out.
[97:43.97]Travis, hello?
[97:44.75]Yeah.
[97:45.53]The moment you step onto the field, the fight begins.
[97:49.59]If you win, you will be ranked ninth.
[97:52.85]If you lose, well, there's no need to go into that.
[97:57.86]Need to pop a breath wind?
[98:00.12]Hit the restroom?
[98:01.66]Brush your teeth?
[98:03.64]When you are ready, step inside.
[98:06.74]To be honest, your chances of survival are slim.
[98:10.24]But trust your force.
[98:12.93]and head for the garden of madness okay how come I never say anything back actual Star Wars game
[98:41.84]Travis, you've made some progress.
[98:44.18]I caught the podcast that said you're getting your edge back.
[98:48.15]Do you remember your second suplex?
[98:50.55]Terrifying trip to the moon.
[98:51.61]The reverse arm salt.
[98:52.97]You remember no professional wrestling move.
[98:56.39]Am I going to get full health?
[99:10.27]I think you do.
[99:10.77]This is an Xbox game.
[99:17.28]This is a Wii game.
[99:21.32]Only for the Wii.
[99:22.50]Well, no, that's not true.
[99:23.42]It is an Xbox game, but it only came out in Japan.
[99:25.48]There's an Xbox... By the way, why?
[99:30.34]So there's a PS3 remake or remaster of this game, and it came out on Xbox 360 as well, but only in Japan for 360.
[99:37.85]Weird.
[99:38.25]Alright, number nine, here we go.
[99:58.51]The virgin
[100:34.47]Nice set of pipes you got there, old man.
[100:37.53]It has always been my dream to perform in a stadium such as this.
[100:42.05]A gentleman from the association told me I could have any stage I wanted today.
[100:47.82]How could I refuse such a kind offer?
[100:51.82]Courtesy of me and my entry fee, no doubt.
[100:54.95]My ex-wife called me the other day and I met my daughter for the first time in ten years.
[101:00.81]We dined at a fancy restaurant.
[101:03.09]One of those that are impossible to get a reservation for.
[101:05.91]And then afterwards, karaoke.
[101:09.22]Who got you the reservation?
[101:12.52]The association took care of it, of course.
[101:17.04]Fuck.
[101:18.14]My entry fee.
[101:44.11]Unfortunately, the atmosphere was a facade.
[101:47.65]Not once did my own daughter look me in the eye.
[101:50.56]This guy's great.
[101:51.08]Old fool.
[101:52.68]Tasted like blood.
[101:56.00]You're a junkie for blood, old man.
[101:58.08]Nipples.
[102:00.06]It's just there.
[102:03.32]It's just a bare... People like us, we're sharks attracted to blood.
[102:09.75]You smelled blood too, didn't you?
[102:11.95]Isn't that why you're here?
[102:15.97]You got it, old man.
[102:17.53]And for some reason, I feel this sense of euphoria.
[102:24.28]Don't die on me too quickly.
[102:26.16]I want to gorge myself on a sense of fulfillment till I vomit.
[102:29.46]This guy shoots.
[102:30.36]You got to watch out for the projectiles.
[102:33.32]Man, this is what I live for.
[102:35.58]Fighting your own kind.
[102:37.57]Nothing's more gratifying.
[102:40.43]See you on the other side.
[102:42.11]Alright.
[102:44.61]Do I have to...
[102:54.37]Not that easy, Travis.
[102:56.93]Alright, here we go.
[102:58.31]Can I do that?
[102:58.99]I think I have to block.
[103:05.09]Good music coming up.
[103:06.83]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
[103:12.88]Low?
[103:13.48]Block low, block high?
[103:15.34]Oh!
[103:16.38]Block low?
[103:21.82]Walk high.
[103:22.98]Walk low?
[103:25.08]Ow, fuck!
[103:48.94]Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[103:50.76]He's not gonna kill her.
[103:54.54]Alright, back up, back up.
[103:56.62]Wait till he shoots.
[103:57.17]Alright, when he goes down to his knees, it's low.
[104:08.09]Can't block these.
[104:19.87]Alright, I got him.
[104:22.15]It's green!
[104:22.99]More.
[104:28.47]How many more?
[104:30.50]Oh, fuck.
[104:51.62]He's gonna change up his... He's gonna go to next phase here in a second.
[105:01.74]Oh, fuck!
[105:02.04]I got it!
[105:02.30]I got it!
[105:02.64]Get it!
[105:12.70]Oh, shit!
[105:13.16]He does more than that.
[105:15.50]Great!
[105:25.53]Alright, I'm fine.
[105:46.54]I can't knock him down?
[105:50.02]Jesus Christ!
[106:07.01]God, get him!
[106:12.51]Back it up.
[106:12.99]I need health.
[106:14.09]I'm fine.
[106:21.85]Oh my fucking god, I have no battery.
[106:23.00]I have to wait till he does a big one.
[106:45.27]Oh, shit.
[106:46.49]I'm fine.
[106:52.05]Kill, kill, kill.
[106:55.72]Oh, don't get hit.
[107:07.48]I'm trying to get another wrestling move on him.
[107:20.33]Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[107:21.93]Don't be an idiot.
[107:39.92]What's he doing?
[107:40.28]What's the next phase?
[107:40.92]I know there's one more thing he does, I think.
[107:46.52]We're good he's dead Yeah
[108:15.01]If I ever found out Durm was secretly a serial killer, I wouldn't have trouble believing it.
[108:18.32]What are you talking about?
[108:30.48]Oh, this guy's a chump.
[108:32.20]That probably would have killed me if I didn't walk high.
[108:35.76]I need to stop being an idiot.
[108:51.65]He's dead.
[108:53.97]One more.
[109:15.70]Oh, fuck!
[109:16.22]Don't be an idiot!
[109:16.82]Don't be an idiot!
[109:17.44]Holy shit!
[109:18.32]Goodbye.
[109:23.76]Don't be a fucking idiot.
[109:33.18]What?

[117:24.48]I forgot it was a QTE.
[117:25.60]I thought it was just the guy.
[117:26.72]I thought I had to wait for him to start to draw, or I would fail the mission.
[117:31.11]I don't know.
[117:32.67]Sing all you want down there.
[117:44.34]Travis, that's rude.

[118:30.43]Isn't that movie, like, apparently one of the worst movies ever made?
[118:38.27]Didn't they remake CGI on it?
[118:40.26]Because they desperately were like, holy shit, this has like six on Rotten Tomatoes.
[118:43.98]You are now ranked number nine.
[118:48.90]What'd you expect?
[118:50.40]Wait a minute.
[118:51.52]Are you getting a little sentimental?
[118:53.62]Still green, aren't you?

[119:58.94]No.
[120:01.30]No, I'm sorry.
[120:12.01]Do you guys... I don't know if you guys remember Blockbuster video.
[120:14.93]But do you remember there was a back room at Blockbuster?
[120:39.43]And it was the porn room.
[120:40.51]It was like another- and there was another- you went into the main store, and then there was the pornography section that was behind another door.
[121:13.78]not making this up is this the same is this the right video store blockbuster porn room which wait what video store had the porn room
[121:44.85]Okay, hold on.
[121:49.26]Yeah, yeah, no, this is real.
[121:55.98]Right by the anime section, they had this little curtain that went into the adult section.
[121:59.26]The place would be open pretty late at night, and as I got into my late teens, it wouldn't be uncommon for my friends and I to be there past midnight on weekends playing fighting games.
[122:07.44]It was then that I learned that the place stayed alive because of its porn clientele.
[122:11.38]During the late night hours, a barrage of men would walk behind that curtain and walk out with stacks of porn to rent.
[122:16.94]It was nuts.
[122:18.14]Literally the busiest time you'd see at the rental counter.
[122:24.92]so no this is real I guess it wasn't blockbuster but it was other just like rental stores that's I that's not a lie there was a secret porn room at a bunch of rental places alright uh two hundred thousand dollar deposit signed travis touchdown
[122:54.84]Not a Blockbuster.
[122:55.76]Yeah, but, alright.
[122:57.73]Is it a lie if I'm saying it in the same two sentences?
[123:02.75]Wait, no, you know, maybe it wasn't.
[123:03.93]Let me check.
[123:05.65]No, a lie would be like, no, it is Blockbuster.
[123:08.29]It's Blockbuster.
[123:08.89]And then six days go by and I go, no, my Blockbuster had it.
[123:12.93]That would be me lying to you.
[123:15.41]This is me trying to get my facts straight in the same two sentences.

[127:33.35]Yeah, I need to go train.
[127:40.36]You actually need to increase your attack power and shit.
[127:42.40]Yeah, that's important.
[127:46.06]Find seven of those balls.
[127:47.50]I've got plenty of time for that.
[127:59.54]Get out of the way.
[128:09.24]Thunder Ryu Building.
[128:13.50]I can learn moves here, I believe.
[128:15.56]Other stuff.
[128:16.02]There's stuff to learn.
[128:17.44]Is this your first ever JermaStream?
[128:22.36]Can everybody please welcome Jonathan L1037 to the channel, please.
[128:26.44]Welcome.
[128:31.76]Oh, yeah, that.
[128:32.38]You want to do that.
[128:34.10]Get over here.
[128:35.00]I'll teach you a little something.
[128:35.90]Take off your clothes.
[128:36.76]Off, off.
[128:37.38]Need your clothes.
[128:38.14]Off to do that.
[128:39.34]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[128:40.12]Want to start?
[128:40.88]Get naked.
[128:41.88]Now stick your butt out.
[128:42.86]Out.
[128:44.04]Can't kill no one unless you have strong stance.
[128:46.48]No, not your arms.
[128:47.24]Your hips.
[128:47.66]Haven't you ever taken a dump in a Japanese-style toilet?
[128:50.60]Strong stance.
[128:51.37]Excellent.
[128:51.89]Just like that.
[128:53.13]Now your underpants.
[128:58.15]That's okay.
[128:58.55]Keep your clothes on.
[129:02.41]Alright, Dumbbell.
[129:03.07]This is Strength.
[129:05.01]Uh, let's see what it is.
[129:08.34]Training that will extend your beam katana's combo attacks.
[129:14.80]Yes, that's pretty damn good.
[129:16.14]You can do them all.
[129:17.58]Increases your strength.
[129:21.32]We'll just do this one first.
[129:23.84]I think I have to tap.
[129:26.00]I'm gonna be damn good at this one, you know it.
[129:28.54]Is it A?
[129:42.80]It's hard to do it on the Wiimote.
[129:47.73]It's actually hard to do that on the Wiimote, because it's not an easy button to press.
[130:02.98]That's not an easy button for me to do the vibrate on.
[130:04.94]You guys know what I mean by that.
[130:14.43]Let's do this one.
[130:15.49]Squats.
[130:18.09]Come on.
[130:30.98]This is bad form.
[130:38.87]This gets way harder if I remember.
[130:43.53]Vitality increased.
[130:44.81]And now let's do this one.
[130:49.38]How do I do this?
[130:50.34]I think it's alternate?
[130:51.28]Come on!
[130:51.62]Is it two pounds?
[130:52.52]Probably not.
[131:17.55]Your beam katana's combo has been extended.
[131:19.66]Nice.
[131:24.96]Oh, that?
[131:25.56]Already leaving already?
[131:26.72]That's it.
[131:27.78]Come again.
[131:28.19]This dude didn't even re-rack.
[131:35.17]Oh, fuck.
[131:43.40]Didn't wipe down equipment.
[131:45.24]That was always... Okay, re-racking, if people just throw 30-pound weights around and just leave them in random places, I would rather have to find the dumbbells than have to sit in a seat that some big motherfucker sits in.
[132:03.64]is sweating profusely, they get up, and the chair is wet.
[132:10.04]Soaking wet.
[132:10.98]I'm not gonna sit on that.
[132:11.94]And then I have to go, and go get the spray bottle, and I have to clean up this person's gross body liquid.
[132:27.20]Or I just walk by and I go, I'm not using, I'm not doing that one today.
[132:42.34]Alright, here we go.
[132:46.58]Come on in, brother.
[132:48.10]Don't judge a book by its cover, okay?
[132:50.83]This is just my personal style.
[132:53.05]A man should stick to his guns, you know?
[132:54.75]Make a good selection now, bro.
[132:56.59]Be sure before you purchase, okay?
[132:58.99]If you don't make up your mind soon, I'll have to stop letting you in here, bro.
[133:03.73]I'm going nuts here.
[133:05.33]I'm hard on myself and my customers, but that's just the right way to do things.
[133:09.17]You know?
[133:11.56]Okay, new jacket.
[133:14.92]I want black.
[133:16.10]Yeah.
[133:18.32]Oh shit, I don't have any money.
[133:23.87]Eat.
[133:24.89]Radioactive.
[133:27.13]Alright, I'm gonna put on the banana shirt.
[133:33.23]New jeans.
[133:33.81]These are expensive.
[133:39.50]Alright, these ones.
[133:42.96]Belts.
[133:45.10]Who gives a shit about a belt?
[133:46.16]Nobody even sees it.
[133:47.76]I don't get the belt thing.
[133:50.42]You can go to Walmart and get a belt for $12.
[133:55.01]Nobody who cares about your belt.
[134:05.77]Guys, I could probably unwrap a fruit by the foot and put it in as a belt.
[134:10.76]And you probably... It would take me to have to tell you that that's what's there for you to notice it.
[134:20.34]I need different sunglasses.
[134:21.38]I don't have enough money for this.
[134:22.94]I want the blue ones.
[134:32.89]Alright, let's go.
[134:35.64]What the fuck was that?
[134:41.04]The game, like, hung up for a second.
[134:42.96]And, you know, that was weird.
[134:44.06]Hey, remember all the money I just spent?
[134:50.24]Uh, yeah.
[134:51.44]Now we have to do coconut missions for, like, an hour.
[134:58.55]If you think I'm making this up, go read any review on this game.
[135:04.62]You'll see all the reviewers gave this game.
[135:07.38]This game got like sevens.
[135:11.38]Like high six, low sevens when it was reviewed.
[135:14.07]When it first came out.
[135:18.03]Because everybody complained about having to do coconut missions for an hour.
[135:22.37]That's because it is.
[135:23.13]No, that's a high seven.
[135:25.11]This is a high seven game.
[135:28.47]I can't hear that this is a mid six game.
[135:31.54]I can't hear that.
[135:34.77]Alright, let's do our job.
[135:41.23]This is a... This is a 7.
[135:45.51]This is like a 7.6 on a sunny day.
[135:46.73]This is like a 7.9 on a rainy day.
[135:47.80]Close the mountain.
[136:02.82]Third class man.
[136:04.04]I have not mastered the secret of the first class yet.
[136:06.76]Wait, is he talking?
[136:09.04]It's not too bad.
[136:10.54]The first rated god will give a hardworking man a little smile.
[136:14.30]Today's job has been listed on the bulletin board.
[136:19.21]Lawn mowing.
[136:20.33]Looking for lawn mowers.
[136:21.43]Cut as much grass as you can inside the required area within the limit.
[136:25.49]$300 for each acre.
[136:26.33]Let's go.
[136:37.74]You can still do assassin missions?
[136:39.02]Oh yeah, that's right.
[136:39.80]There is one available.
[136:41.46]We'll do this one first.
[136:45.87]Locate the client.
[136:46.89]Yep, yep, yep.
[136:53.03]Oh, what are the pink blips on the map?
[137:02.78]I don't remember what those are.
[137:04.38]Alright, do you think I can jump a house?
[137:09.70]I'm trying to jump!
[137:10.52]Why wouldn't it jump?
[137:12.18]Like, we won't have enough battery?
[137:13.16]Alright, don't kill the client.
[137:31.78]The blips are tre- Ooh, the treasure!
[137:33.42]Alright, nice.
[137:35.77]No, I won't... Get out of here.
[137:44.59]There are dreams in the unspoken rules of Santa Destroy.
[137:47.75]A verdant law awaits you in your future.
[137:49.79]A maze like Manor House with a huge pool and a brilliant green lawn.
[137:54.78]Just as the god of hard work, handwork, waits at the end of a long day's work, the god of lawns shall smile upon all who mow them.
[138:03.46]Cut, cut, cut, and mow.
[138:09.71]Handwork.
[138:11.87]Yeah, this one sucks.
[138:15.53]Cut back the wildly overgrown grass.
[138:17.31]A and B. Twist the... Oh, I have to twist the Wiimote.
[138:23.87]Z button turns?
[138:25.05]Wait, what?
[138:26.14]What do you mean, turns?
[138:28.54]I feel like playing Farmer's Dynasty again.
[138:48.49]This is a generous acre.
[138:50.01]Oh, shit.
[138:57.83]I have to get at least... I have to do it.
[138:59.43]The whole thing.
[139:01.65]This grass is so bad.
[139:02.85]This is... It really is... I know this didn't even exist back then.
[139:08.73]Did it?
[139:08.99]This is the default Unity grass.
[139:13.43]I don't even think that it... No, yeah.
[139:15.15]Unity wasn't a thing back here.
[139:28.02]Yeah, Unity didn't exist.
[139:29.86]Maybe it did, but it wasn't out to the public?
[139:39.09]Could you make a game in Unity in, like, 2005?
[139:40.57]No.
[139:40.67]It came out in 2005.
[139:49.33]Maybe?
[139:49.55]I don't know.
[139:57.49]This is gonna drop me nuts if I don't get this whole thing eventually.
[140:00.03]I'm gonna have to do this a few times so I can get all of it at once, you know what I mean?
[140:13.92]Oh, look at me!
[140:16.34]Look at me!
[140:23.40]Shit.
[140:25.78]I'm not gonna get it all.
[140:26.72]I have to get at least 100.
[140:27.34]No, I'll get 80.
[140:30.72]86.
[140:31.04]Dammit.
[140:37.90]How much is that worth?
[140:44.22]Coconuts are like 20 to 25 thousand.
[140:47.26]This is twen- this is- is this longer than coconuts?
[140:50.14]I think this might be actually easier than coconuts.
[140:53.38]Hey, third raider, I've got another job for you.
[140:55.12]Something a little shadier.
[140:57.19]Sent an introduction ticket.
[140:59.17]The road to becoming a first raider is long and hard.
[141:01.19]Get your ass in here.
[141:06.27]There's better jobs.
[141:07.55]Yeah, that's true.
[141:08.41]New assassin is available.
[141:09.41]Cool.
[141:10.07]Well, put us right in front of it.
[141:11.09]Let's do it.
[141:16.54]It's an easier job, but it doesn't bop.
[141:19.70]Yeah, I feel you.
[141:24.36]Okay, we got the bronze on Pizza Butt.
[141:27.65]Snake Hall, 2,000, 3,000, 4,500 per kill.
[141:31.17]Baseball battle.
[141:31.77]Go on a batting killing spree.
[141:34.77]Oh, let's do this one.
[141:37.69]4,500 dollars per kill.
[141:40.95]I think I just didn't play baseball.
[141:53.72]Jeremiah, you'd look a lot cuter if you were 20 years younger.
[142:07.23]Sorry that age exists.
[142:11.67]Maybe one day it won't.
[142:12.69]I want to dig.
[142:27.28]Maybe one day you can live to be, like, 200 and not, like, get saggy cheeks like I do.
[142:35.59]You'd be 14, boy.
[142:42.33]Oh, shit.
[142:44.07]Hey!
[142:44.61]Whoa!
[142:46.82]What the fuck?
[142:59.05]Fan that guy!
[143:06.13]He just did the math in his head.
[143:12.05]Where's this treasure?
[143:12.94]It's right here?
[143:19.80]Am I not on top of it?
[143:25.10]Where is it?
[143:26.61]Got it.
[143:33.11]Well, this is where that person says, oh, well, Jerma, I thought you were 55 years old.
[143:38.22]It's like, oh, well, that's, yeah, I see you making like a joke.
[143:41.86]You're making fun of me.
[143:42.96]Okay.
[143:54.54]it was a joke yeah it's a it's a you look old joke I'm aware of those alright I know the car hitboxes are huge yeah they're enormous alright let me go do this one
[144:24.30]He's getting tired of them.
[144:27.46]No.
[144:29.79]I have some really, really important news for you guys.
[144:34.11]When you turn 30, you don't care about that anymore.
[144:39.76]Like, I don't.
[144:40.60]I know.
[144:41.08]I know.
[144:41.50]Like, I don't.
[144:42.60]Like, it doesn't bother me.
[144:45.46]After you turn 30 years old, it's just like, it don't matter.
[144:48.60]I'm going to still, I'm getting older now.
[144:50.78]That's it.
[144:51.26]And people go, wow, you look old.
[144:52.80]I mean, that's because I'm getting older.
[144:54.76]That's okay.
[144:56.14]When I was 29, I was like, no, I can't turn, I can't turn 30.
[144:58.87]I'm going to be old.
[145:01.53]And then the second you turn 30, it's like, oh, okay.
[145:03.93]Everything's fine.
[145:05.71]Alright.
[145:16.08]No!
[145:23.67]You're really handsome.
[145:24.37]Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
[145:28.55]That's a shitload of money.
[145:29.85]It's $36,000 for that.
[145:30.39]I'm just doing that one again.
[145:34.97]How does it feel to have both feet in the grave?
[145:38.46]Oh, well, let's see.
[145:40.52]Thirty... Thirty-four.
[145:44.68]Let's figure... What's the average age of a U.S.
[145:47.41]male?
[145:49.35]What is it?
[145:49.65]80?
[145:49.67]75, is it?
[145:56.68]What's... 77? 75?
[146:10.12]So, now, what is the average age of a US male?
[146:13.70]With a shitload of medical problems.
[146:16.70]You know, like, I've got a hernia, I've got fucking colitis, I have costochondritis.
[146:20.70]How old is that?
[146:21.40]65?
[146:21.42]30?
[146:21.44]Alright, yeah, so am I halfway dead?
[146:24.43]Oh, shit.
[146:36.09]I don't have... Oh, fuck, I do.
[146:37.81]I've got two feet in the grave!
[146:46.16]I'm going to the beach to get this one.
[146:47.16]I have to get down there.
[146:55.14]Do I fear death?
[146:56.28]I'll just come back as a butterfly and fly around for a little bit.
[147:05.94]That'd be fine.
[147:09.44]And then... And then when I get squashed into somebody's windshield... I'll wake up again, and I'll be like a fucking ant.
[147:20.65]See, that's the thing about... Do you believe in reincarnation?
[147:25.04]I mean, that's a very interesting concept, but... What determines... There are like 600 trillion ants.
[147:33.37]You respawning as a human is... It's like 0.00000000001%.
[147:37.98]There are 600 million ants for every one person, probably.
[147:48.86]You're gonna be an ant.
[147:49.67]You're gonna respawn as an ant over and over and over and over again.
[147:54.15]For millenniums.
[148:00.51]And then maybe you'll... Holy shit, I'm a baby.
[148:03.11]Oh my god, it took 600 fucking eons.
[148:10.41]I had to live with it like 600 trillion fucking times.
[148:15.48]Don't step on me!
[148:16.70]Oh, fuck.
[148:18.96]No, I'm okay.
[148:23.70]The hive's being invaded by a killer beast.
[148:26.64]Oh, no, I'm a person again.
[148:34.43]imagine having to live 500 million lifetimes as like the the worst life ever like that hurry hurry yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna carry this piece of sand in my mouth oh okay I'm gonna walk and place the sand one grain of sand down turn around do it again do another grain of sand do this to chill I'm dead
[149:01.26]And then you respawn again.
[149:02.72]Oh fuck, I gotta get that green sand!
[149:06.28]Let me make sure I lay down a chemical trail so my blind friends can see where I'm going.
[149:18.31]Alright, where's my bike?
[149:26.62]Travis!
[149:31.91]Reincarnation doesn't work like that.
[149:35.05]I mean, if it did.
[149:36.33]But if it did.
[149:38.67]If it was just luck of the lottery.
[149:44.47]If you respawned 500 million times as an ant... The one time you respawn as an ant-eater... You're gonna be like, oh my... No!
[149:54.83]No, no, no, no, no.
[149:56.33]I can't do this!
[149:58.83]I can't do this!
[150:02.34]I know what it's like to BE that guy!
[150:18.45]You're gonna respawn as a fish, like a goldfish in a bowl, and be like, oh, thank god!
[150:24.87]That's your cooldown period.
[150:26.51]That's when you get to just chill.
[150:29.90]It's gonna seem like five minutes.
[150:35.12]The three years that you're a goldfish in a bowl is going to feel like five minutes.
[150:39.02]I want to go to the... Where is it?
[150:51.59]How much money do I need?
[150:52.59]A lot.
[150:55.79]I want to go the other way.
[151:03.06]What's some of the new ones?
[151:03.78]Let me try one of the other new ones.
[151:07.42]What if you get a turtle?
[151:08.20]I mean, that's pretty... That's not bad.
[151:10.80]That's pretty good.
[151:12.10]That's like 100 years.
[151:13.84]Can't some turtles live to be like 150?
[151:15.44]That's not bad.
[151:17.72]But still, it does not even come close to the light years of time you'll be an ant or a beetle or something.
[151:27.92]Kill using wrestling moves only.
[151:30.48]No other moves are allowed for this mission.
[151:34.47]I'll try it.
[151:37.73]Would you want to live as a turtle?
[151:40.59]But if that's what you got, it's better than living as an ant.
[151:50.94]Is it though?
[151:52.62]Yeah, you can like swim around and just like lie on a rock for six hours.
[151:58.82]You guys have a... Some of you guys might even own turtles.
[152:01.76]They get to just sit down on a rock and just have the sun beam down on them for like 14, 15 hours a day.
[152:18.32]That's pretty... That's not bad.
[152:19.86]That's pretty cool, actually.
[152:26.09]Respawning as an ant over and over again is the equivalent of waking up and nuclear bombs are going off around your house all day until you're dead.
[152:35.07]Just every second.
[152:38.05]It's just mayhem.
[152:43.25]I could sit on a rock for a little while as a turtle.
[152:45.55]What if you're born as a pigeon?
[152:55.25]I can fly.
[152:56.65]You can just fly around.
[152:59.81]Okay, some of you guys that want to... What do you mean, be a pigeon?
[153:04.08]You know that a lot of... A decent amount of pigeons, like, fly around New York City and eat old french fries on the ground.
[153:11.06]That's... What's wrong?
[153:15.16]Is that bad?
[153:15.88]What's wrong with that?
[153:22.10]In fact, that's kind of like... That's kind of how my life is now.
[153:25.98]You know, like, just eating french fries and, like, junk food.
[153:30.15]And going... You know what I mean?
[153:31.13]Like, that doesn't sound bad.
[153:37.81]Only wrestling boots.
[153:38.71]Pigeons are like the goats of the bird world.
[153:41.99]Alright, only kill with... Oh, right.
[153:48.56]I can only...
[153:54.55]Because isn't a goat's stomach made out of, like, rocks?
[154:01.17]Like, can't a goat eat, like, a... Can't goats eat, like, anything?
[154:05.41]No.
[154:09.29]Isn't there, like, a... No, I swear to God, there's, like... Who has, like, the iron stomach?
[154:19.99]Anyone can eat anything.
[154:23.45]no no I swear to god there's like something about it's some it's it's go right I mean they're not supposed to like obviously you're not they're not supposed to without you know but there's something about the way that they process the food or something it's called a gastrolith right I know I'm not crazy
[154:55.27]Bro, they can literally eat razor wire.
[154:58.55]I didn't know that.
[154:59.25]New move.
[155:00.81]Tombstone.
[155:01.85]That was fucking awesome.
[155:02.97]Tombstone again.
[155:25.63]Was this 3,000 per kill?
[155:26.41]People are shooting guns now.
[155:29.03]Bro, please.
[155:38.34]Bro, what?
[155:41.76]Why can I not... Hit B. Alright, 13 is an unlucky number.
[155:47.60]I don't like it.
[155:50.50]Ah, shit.
[155:55.48]That shouldn't be bad.
[155:58.32]40,000.
[156:04.08]Chill, bro.
[156:04.74]I'm fine.
[156:08.53]That's the first time I get to see the new sword.
[156:16.30]How much money do I got?
[156:20.10]What about if you spawn as a whale?
[156:22.26]Alright, I got 114,000.
[156:23.10]I need more money than that.
[156:24.44]Damn, I need a shitload more.
[156:27.42]This is why you don't buy clothes until you have 5 million dollars.
[156:36.59]What are my thoughts on goat cheese?
[156:39.75]I wonder how polarizing this is going to be.
[156:43.04]I don't think it will be very polarizing.
[156:44.98]I don't think it will be.
[156:46.92]I think it's disgusting.
[156:48.78]I think it tastes like dirt.
[156:50.34]I think it tastes like actual physical soil in the ground.
[156:52.96]Dirt.
[156:54.66]I hate it.
[157:01.50]Third class, man.
[157:02.58]I have not mastered the secret of the first class yet.
[157:04.44]It's not too bad.
[157:06.70]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[157:09.26]Any moon?
[157:12.87]Alright, I gotta get gold on this one.
[157:18.13]It's way too overpowering for me.
[157:20.71]I can tell when goat cheese is in anything.
[157:22.79]It's like the princess lying on the mattress with the pee under it.
[157:26.80]I know it's in there.
[157:28.20]If you give me even a tiny little crumble of goat cheese, I will take a bite and just... I know that there's a pee under my mattress.
[157:44.74]P-E-A, guys.
[157:54.87]You guys don't know that?
[157:55.71]That's like a classic fairy tale.
[158:02.29]You think we don't?
[158:03.07]You think we know?
[158:03.92]Alright, I gotta get gold on this one.
[158:10.72]But do you like cream cheese?
[158:11.80]Yes.
[158:12.88]I do.
[158:15.77]I love cream cheese.
[158:20.26]You know what?
[158:28.24]Forget about technique.
[158:29.06]I'm just going to try to get as many acres as possible.
[158:30.80]Who cares if I don't get it all?
[158:38.30]Already much better pace than last time.
[158:53.60]Cream cheese is dank.
[158:57.62]Yeah, I actually don't like... I mean, it's not that I don't like it, but... I'd rather there be stuff in the cream cheese.
[159:05.29]Like chive, onion... Salmon.
[159:09.99]Like salmon on the cream.
[159:11.81]It's got to be dressed up a little.
[159:18.26]I mean, I love it.
[159:19.58]I do like it.
[159:20.08]But if I had a choice, I would eat the one that had something in it.
[159:24.73]Vegetables.
[159:26.03]Vegetable medley, whatever it's called.
[159:27.75]The vegetable one where there's little carrot chunks and celery chunks.
[159:33.75]Don't make this a fucking three-hour stream, guys.
[159:36.22]What are you doing?
[159:52.30]Get it all.
[159:53.64]There's only one more piece.
[159:54.70]There's one more nose hair.
[159:56.42]Trim the last nose hair.
[159:57.74]Got it.
[159:59.12]Yeah.
[160:03.04]Liver and cream cheese is pretty good.
[160:10.21]I can't eat liver.
[160:11.53]I've tried.
[160:13.43]Chicken livers and... No, I can't do it.
[160:16.25]It's too heavy for me.
[160:17.99]It has too strong of a flavor.
[160:21.15]I know it's so good for you, too.
[160:22.83]I know eating chicken liver is... New fight mission.
[160:27.75]Oh, cool.
[160:31.37]Chicken livers are... They're packed with so much nutrients.
[160:36.66]I know.
[160:38.90]I can't do it, though.
[160:39.70]It's just not for me.
[160:45.68]Would you eat cream cheese pizza?
[160:49.64]Ugh.
[160:51.58]Probably not.
[160:52.26]Pizza's already heavy.
[160:53.21]I don't think I'd want to weigh pizza down even more.
[161:03.74]My mother used to make chicken livers all the time.
[161:06.38]And I would try it every time.
[161:08.34]And I would not like it every time.
[161:20.32]That was horrible.
[161:21.07]That was really bad.
[161:27.25]We've already had the cheese debate in this channel.
[161:33.30]I did the cheese tier list.
[161:34.58]I hate to bring politics into this chat, but what's your opinion on stuffed crust pizzas?
[161:46.39]They are unbelievable.
[161:49.57]They're unbelievable.
[161:53.84]But you have to be in the mood for it.
[161:58.53]Stuffed Crutz Pizza is disgusting.
[162:02.74]Except for the one occasion every maybe few months where you are just sitting on your couch and your eyes, bing, whip open and there's a light bulb over your head.
[162:13.09]And you go, I want a stuffed crust pizza right now.
[162:16.37]Then it's a 10 out of 10.
[162:18.35]It's the best fucking thing on Earth when you have the light bulb.
[162:22.29]In every other scenario, no, it's horrible.
[162:24.37]But that happens sometimes.
[162:28.57]Free Fight Mission.
[162:29.43]Kill until you take a single hit from the enemy.
[162:31.75]Kill them all within the time limit.
[162:32.95]Oh, this is going to be hard.
[162:39.11]Don't take damage.
[162:41.79]Use stances with this weapon.
[163:00.40]now it's not embarrassing if I die I mean it would be but not even cross yes
[163:24.83]He's still alive!
[163:33.49]He's still alive!
[163:34.09]He's still alive!
[163:34.71]That guy's still alive.
[163:35.27]Greedy!
[163:57.94]Alright, I'll take 10.
[164:03.04]I'll take 10 kills.
[164:06.27]Now it's gonna get... Oh, I did it.
[164:07.57]There we go.
[164:11.95]Cheese is disgusting.
[164:16.54]Um...
[164:21.56]I mean, it's... A lot of people can't eat it.
[164:26.85]If you're lactose intolerant, like, cheese kind of balls up in people.
[164:30.65]So, it does... I don't find that to be, like, a, what'd you say?
[164:33.91]How could you say that?
[164:37.45]If you're lactose intolerant, you... It kills you.
[164:45.62]It's... I mean, I love that stuff.
[164:50.14]But even, it's hard to eat that, it's hard to eat cheese in large quantities.
[165:03.77]False.
[165:08.07]it's okay well it's not hard to eat cheese in large quantities it's very easy because it tastes really great and you can sit there and eat it all day but what I mean is physically after you do that you might feel quite ill
[165:40.19]Barry's back.
[165:44.03]No, can we change that name?
[165:45.39]Because it's not backtracking.
[165:46.83]Can you call me, like, Clarification Chris?
[165:50.89]That's more accurate.
[165:59.64]I'm gonna get up there.
[166:05.42]It's backtracking the name.
[166:06.90]No, that's... It's just... Clarification.
[166:11.02]Chris.
[166:17.59]Additional statement.
[166:19.59]Aaron.
[166:23.63]I want to get... Do I have gold on both of these?
[166:29.31]I do.
[166:29.41]Oh, shit.
[166:29.67]I do have gold.
[166:35.07]No, I don't want to do any... I've got gold.
[166:36.42]I don't want to do them.
[166:37.02]I'm going to see if I can get the Sashimon.
[166:44.14]Juxtaposition Jill.
[166:47.56]Correction Kevin.
[166:48.44]Alright, I'm going to do another... Let's go, sir.
[167:10.21]I guess I look cool doing it.
[167:12.74]Addendum Andrew.
[167:14.34]Addendum Andy.
[167:19.86]Addendum... Addendum Andy.
[167:44.26]Why does it all... I wanted to turn the other way.
[167:45.68]Why does it always turn this way?
[167:47.18]Maybe it's the other way I'm holding the Wiimote.
[168:03.85]Hold down Drift?
[168:04.71]Is Drift, uh...
[168:09.13]Buy a new sword?
[168:09.85]Alright then.
[168:11.13]I have a new one right now.
[168:12.89]I'm not gonna buy another one.
[168:14.27]No, I won't be able to have it in the next mission.
[168:27.21]This is Simpsons hit and run flashbacks.
[168:28.95]Here we go.
[168:41.58]Oh, no, this is not.
[168:42.80]Oh, this is another free fight.
[168:45.74]Alright, try not to get hit again.
[168:52.01]They have guns.
[168:56.59]They have guns.
[168:57.45]Oh, they don't.
[169:00.17]Not guns.
[169:00.61]I thought it was guns.
[169:08.86]Ooh, he almost hit me.
[169:12.34]Whoa!
[169:15.94]Whoa!
[169:17.88]Okay, I'm fine.
[169:19.90]Whoa!
[169:20.92]No, I'm not.
[169:23.50]Whoa!
[169:29.19]He almost hit me.
[169:30.15]Whoa!
[169:30.99]Okay.
[169:36.67]Get in the corner.
[169:39.15]I gotta get in the corner.
[169:42.95]Who's left?
[169:43.33]Okay, get this guy first.
[169:56.86]Oh shit.
[169:58.08]Oh shit.
[169:58.78]Run, run, run, run, run.
[169:59.68]Turn.
[170:01.22]Whoa!
[170:01.98]Whoa!
[170:02.54]Whoa!
[170:02.98]Whoa!
[170:03.36]I almost got hit!
[170:12.30]Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[170:22.09]Watch it.
[170:23.49]One more guy right here.
[170:34.31]Come here.
[170:45.28]Got it.
[170:45.58]That's it, right?
[170:47.98]Any more?
[170:48.28]Yeah.
[170:53.64]These missions are the hardest thing in the game.
[170:56.64]Yeah, they are.
[170:57.14]Give me the gold.
[171:05.39]This game is inherently satisfying.
[171:06.95]Yes, it is.
[171:09.56]Alright, got enough money for the entrance for the next fee.
[171:12.38]For the next Jerm or Rumble.
[171:15.18]$212,000.
[171:15.20]Okay.
[171:15.82]Let me go back.
[171:20.18]Let me go back to the house and save.
[171:24.20]I have the new blade on.
[171:25.64]Yeah, I do.
[171:26.98]Because I'm using one hand to hold it.
[171:28.20]The other one was two-handed, wasn't it?
[171:33.54]Travis for the next Rumble.
[171:36.22]I already told you what's going to happen to Smash.
[171:46.82]Fighters pass two, combatant three.
[171:54.68]I just stole somebody else's prediction?
[172:18.90]What?
[172:23.02]I'm playing No More Heroes today.
[172:27.82]That's why I'm saying that.
[172:29.24]And he's a Nintendo character.
[172:34.33]Let me have this.
[172:37.71]Let me have... You can tell I'm talking with my hands.
[172:52.06]We don't need any more sword characters.
[172:56.88]Well, that just... Oh, no, I can't say this.
[172:58.82]Never mind.
[173:02.56]No.
[173:06.61]Well, then... Well, then delete, like, the 12 Fire Emblem characters that are the same character.
[173:13.17]I tried to stop... Stop!
[173:14.97]I tried to stop myself.
[173:19.91]Pick me up!
[173:20.29]Pick me up!
[173:20.65]Come on, pick me up!
[173:48.75]Oh, what's that?
[173:50.97]Hold on, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hold on.
[173:53.55]Well, I mean, here's the thing though.
[173:57.56]If you're a big fan, if you're a big fan of Fire Emblem, look, if you like those characters, that's really, really good.
[174:07.53]I'm happy that you care about that series.
[174:09.95]I'm just saying that very, very clearly, if there's already like 10, 12 sword characters in the game, I don't, we don't need that many more, I guess is what I'm trying to say.
[174:22.06]It's a cool series though.
[174:24.60]Fire Emblem is awesome.
[174:25.62]I played it.
[174:29.69]It's very, very good.
[174:37.69]Play with the cat.
[174:41.59]You hungry?
[174:45.31]We get to watch the cat eat.
[174:46.45]You thought there was only one or two cat interactions.
[174:48.71]There's like 10.
[174:50.85]There, there.
[174:58.00]Hungry cat.
[175:15.98]Moments like these is what makes me know that Travis isn't that bad.
[175:22.63]Yeah, let's go to the draw, let's see.
[175:35.10]Yeah, that's the original one.
[175:36.62]I'm using the new one.
[175:38.14]It's the Tsubaki.
[175:39.44]Yeah, I got it on.
[175:41.27]Alright, let's go do assassin mission number eight.
[175:53.01]Travis is a shithead.
[176:00.70]Travis is a bad dude.
[176:03.82]Yeah, pretty... I mean, yeah.
[176:11.02]Fuckhead.
[176:17.64]PS3 remake sucks.
[176:21.00]Well, that's... I'm... I know that strong opinion.
[176:24.32]I'm not... I'm not playing the PS3 one.
[176:29.51]This is the...
[176:32.26]Wii version of the game.
[176:35.84]I hope you could hear the air quotes.
[176:54.05]How do I dig into concrete?
[176:56.41]Where is that?
[177:01.49]What version is the Wii version?
[177:03.41]God damn it.
[177:06.21]My control is rumbling.
[177:10.42]There it is.
[177:27.20]He means we, guys.
[177:28.22]Yes.
[177:29.52]He means... This is what he means.
[177:31.56]Yes.
[177:37.35]Yes.
[177:39.97]Yes.
[177:42.03]Yes.
[177:42.43]There it is.
[177:50.97]He's gotta prove he owns the game.
[177:53.11]And the console.
[177:54.94]He's gotta prove he owns the game and the console in his closet!
[178:11.64]Play Rhythm Heaven, you coward.
[178:14.16]That's part of the plan!
[178:15.04]Travis?
[178:16.06]Yeah?
[178:17.02]The next fight has been set.
[178:19.12]Wait a sec.
[178:20.14]Why the hell are you telling me this over the phone?
[178:22.53]Why?
[178:23.55]Because I cannot decide what to wear.
[178:24.87]Oh, shit.
[178:25.03]Is she naked?
[178:25.39]I didn't even look.
[178:26.21]I was looking at chat.
[178:27.72]Big shots from across the nation will be there.
[178:30.28]This is serious business.
[178:32.16]So serious that I'm going to spray perfume on every square.
[178:37.24]Oh, shit.
[178:37.74]That's close.
[178:38.78]That's close.
[178:39.10]Yeah, whatever.
[178:40.46]Right, right.
[178:41.28]Your next opponent.
[178:42.75]Head for the school.
[178:44.75]To the school?
[178:45.85]And then what?
[178:47.11]Just go.
[178:47.97]You'll know what I'm talking about, I think.
[178:50.59]What do you mean, you think?
[178:52.41]Omega porn game.
[178:53.73]It's not a fucking Omega porn game.
[179:31.04]Omega Porn Game.
[179:36.03]Ranking Battle 8.
[179:37.57]No, guys, an Omega Porn Game is just you going to Pornhub and opening up a tab.
[179:44.79]What are you talking about?
[179:53.20]That's not a game.
[180:13.31]Let's play that game.
[180:14.29]Stream that.
[180:15.21]Okay, relax.
[180:15.95]Rangate!
[180:43.57]I don't know what that is.
[180:52.04]I don't know what that is.
[180:56.26]I'm not gonna say the rest of that.
[180:57.86]I don't know what the fuck that is.
[181:16.35]I'm not saying any shit.
[181:17.59]Just look at him!
[181:20.39]Kill!
[181:20.59]Kill!
[181:20.81]Kill!
[181:21.12]Kill him.
[181:21.44]He's got a fire axe.
[181:50.17]Any goodies that I missed?
[181:51.31]That's my favorite one.
[182:24.01]What the, how many combos do I, was it five hit or six hit combo now?
[182:40.99]Date the AI from AI Dungeons and get its number.
[182:49.35]What are you talking about?
[182:53.29]I'm on team Travis.
[182:57.66]Travis!
[182:58.82]Can you play the rest of Nancy, Drew?
[183:10.18]Um... No.
[183:27.42]Not today.
[183:27.94]Hey, what the fuck?
[183:33.78]No, not today.
[183:37.14]That's a based response.
[183:37.94]Uh oh.
[183:38.14]Based.
[183:57.40]What was that Easy
[184:27.17]Double.
[184:28.61]Aw.
[184:29.26]No!
[184:34.02]No!
[184:34.88]There's nobody here.
[184:49.77]No.
[184:54.47]Aw.
[185:00.42]Damn it.
[185:02.92]Damn it.
[185:05.58]Money?
[185:07.40]Ooh!
[185:08.20]Money!
[185:17.19]Someone just said, I love money.
[185:31.39]Let me see what this does.
[185:31.99]I'm not doing anything.
[185:43.98]This makes lots of smoke.
[185:45.66]Do you love money?
[185:50.11]Money.
[185:55.27]Oh, it extinguishes you if you're on fire.
[185:59.03]That's what it does.
[186:00.41]Of course it does.
[186:04.64]Hey, anybody in chat love money?
[186:05.98]You idiot.
[186:10.26]What's that?
[186:15.95]I need it.
[186:17.47]Holy shit, what is this one?
[186:36.12]This one is all bar, bar, bar?
[186:38.18]What does it do, though?
[186:43.18]Oh my god.
[186:44.35]Okay.
[186:45.15]It's an instant kill.
[186:46.97]That's unfortunate.
[186:52.67]You turn into a creepypasta?
[187:04.91]I got it again, shit!
[187:10.00]What does he say?
[187:16.10]Raspberry chocolate brownie!
[187:20.58]Strawberry on the fucking shortcake!
[187:23.49]Oh, there's nobody here.
[187:34.15]Doesn't that make you ineffective?
[187:39.07]Oh, it makes me... Where do I go?
[188:01.28]I gotta go.
[188:01.90]I gotta get out of here.
[188:06.90]He's doing a jermaWalk?
[188:08.50]How is this a jermaWalk?
[188:17.51]How do I stop this?
[188:23.29]Dude, get to a bathroom.
[188:24.79]What are you talking about?
[188:26.25]I got it.
[188:26.59]I can't...
[188:43.21]There we go.
[188:44.51]Now, I can do a bunch of combos.
[188:49.27]Is this a rocket wheelchair?
[189:00.97]I think I'd be a pretty good swing sword voice for a video game, you know what I'm saying?
[189:14.39]Come on, give me... I need... Please.
[189:20.95]It's Link?
[189:34.80]No, it's not.
[189:43.63]No, it's not.
[189:47.27]That's not Link.
[189:49.09]No, it's not.
[189:53.28]Yeah, that one is.
[189:54.18]I got it again.
[190:06.69]Why am I getting so many lucky rolls here?
[190:09.73]I don't think it's doing anything.
[190:15.77]Imagine saying that and then getting destroyed.
[190:17.81]Wait, what?
[190:24.99]I got that guy like five times.
[190:26.13]Oh, fuck.
[190:26.43]I don't know which way I was going in the hall.
[190:27.84]What a pain.
[190:31.74]You're a joke.
[190:33.80]What a pain.
[190:38.08]You're a joke.
[190:48.70]Get the fuck out of here.
[190:51.74]Grab, grab, grab.
[191:00.11]Grab him.
[191:15.45]I left for an hour and a half and he made the same joke from an hour and a half ago.
[191:21.79]Which one?
[191:23.85]What do you mean?
[191:24.25]What are you talking about?
[191:29.27]What did I say?
[191:33.75]You're a joke.
[191:36.05]What?
[191:36.43]I'm just... No, I'm just... I'm repeating the... What are you talking about?
[191:41.51]I'm repeating the word that he says when he says you're a joke.
[191:47.12]What?
[191:54.20]Are you prepared?
[191:55.86]I'm going to say that a bunch of fucking times, guys.
[191:57.66]I...
[192:02.34]Kim told, I probably told the story, Kim walked down the stairs one time.
[192:08.10]And I was for three days straight, was repeating the same Thanos lines from Infinity War.
[192:17.68]She came down while I was going like this universe is finite, its resources finite, the will to I just I did his entire monologue all the time.
[192:28.76]And eventually she was like, can you stop doing the Thanos monologue?
[192:34.36]And I'm just like, what are you talking about?
[192:37.24]I don't even know I'm doing that.
[192:39.00]It just happens.
[192:39.82]I just do that.
[192:42.58]One time, okay, I was taking a shower like three or four weeks ago.
[192:46.75]And I was just talking.
[192:48.63]I was just doing like a scene from a movie.
[192:52.03]And I didn't know, I didn't think anyone was home.
[192:54.98]She just walks in and I look at her and I'm like, oh, hey, hey.
[192:57.80]She's like, what are you doing?
[192:58.47]I'm like, I don't know.
[192:59.61]I'm just like talking.
[193:00.41]That's the last time you showered?
[193:09.25]Get out of here.
[193:26.49]When this stream is over today, I'm going to be just hanging out in my room.
[193:32.35]Just going, are you prepared, huh?
[193:34.89]Are you prepared, huh?
[193:38.31]Over and over again, until I go to sleep.
[193:40.00]I don't know, it's just fun.
[193:51.24]Stop hitting me.
[193:54.00]Stop hitting me.
[194:28.29]You're annoying me now.
[194:31.09]Now you're annoying me.
[194:34.45]Outta here.
[194:47.50]Bang.
[194:47.90]Alright.
[194:49.18]That was a tricky roam.
[194:50.97]His brain can only hold so much data.
[194:56.74]My brain can hold a shitload of data.
[194:58.50]Thank you very much.
[195:01.25]Look, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, uh... 1 in the 5 from the number.
[195:03.23]Um... Uh-oh.
[195:03.57]A new Sith Lord.
[195:46.66]Ow.
[195:49.10]Don't!
[195:51.04]Wait for the opportunity.
[195:51.86]Dammit!
[195:52.08]Did it hit me?
[195:53.20]Shit, these guys are kicking my ass.
[196:15.45]No, no, no, he's gonna shoot me!
[196:16.89]Holy fuck, I cut through that guy at a leg.
[196:18.94]Holy, holy heck.
[196:27.28]Battery, battery.
[196:28.26]Fuck, I don't know what he's doing.
[196:56.18]There it is.
[196:57.12]On his neck.
[197:06.24]Go back to Nancy Drew.
[197:06.98]This clearly isn't your pace.
[197:08.28]And you think Nancy Drew is my pace?
[197:09.78]I had to use a walkthrough to complete the puzzles in that game.
[197:14.54]I'm confused.
[197:16.46]I have your statement here.
[197:19.56]I had to be on GameBoomers.com the whole stream.
[197:27.03]I knew it.
[197:27.49]I called you a cheater.
[197:28.20]We already talked about that already.
[197:30.98]That wasn't a secret.
[197:33.44]I was only using it when it was completely necessary.
[197:39.08]Like any time a fucking math problem would come on screen.
[197:46.33]Hey, Travis.
[197:47.93]Your next ranked fight begins the moment you step into that room.
[197:51.85]Win, and you'll rise to eighth in rank.
[197:55.73]And an even deeper
[197:57.79]I am 100% certain you're returning from this battle, Travis.
[198:01.56]In a body bag.
[198:02.58]But trust your force.
[198:24.07]And head for the garden of madness.
[198:26.11]Oh, come on.
[198:26.77]You don't give me give me a break.
[198:30.18]Give me a break.
[198:30.86]Come on.
[198:31.70]Really?
[198:32.10]Come on.
[198:32.42]Give me a break.
[198:33.24]Give me a break.
[198:35.60]Give me a break.
[198:38.94]Your ADHD is an overdrive.
[198:49.03]Sometimes it does feel like that though.
[198:50.71]Remember the Bing commercial?
[198:53.77]Where it was like, fried fish, fried fish, $2.99, fried fish, $2.99, $2, $200.
[198:56.67]The people all yelling at each other in the grocery store and stuff.
[199:07.15]Somebody would say something and somebody would say something after that that was connected to that word.
[199:11.06]You guys don't remember this commercial?
[199:18.68]Yeah, search overload.
[199:20.54]That's- that was a cl- that- not even that long ago.
[199:22.73]That was like five years ago.
[199:25.17]Travis, now you're getting back into the groove.
[199:27.07]Remember the 18th suplex of your master.
[199:29.51]The trust-building exercise gone wrong.
[199:31.55]Captured.
[199:31.99]You remembered an old professional wrestling move.
[199:36.63]Damn, search overload.
[199:54.86]Jeremiah, it was 12 years ago.
[200:01.60]But... Those commercials were funny.
[200:06.57]Jeremiah, I'm sorry I didn't mean to upset you with the Ryu's joke thing.
[200:22.28]Rank 8.
[200:22.76]Here we go.
[200:34.49]A rankings fight?
[200:37.78]Yeah, how about it?
[200:41.20]Alright.
[200:41.60]Will you give me a minute?
[200:49.39]Wait for me in the hallway.
[200:51.65]Right.
[201:06.20]Mind if we do this somewhere else?
[201:09.02]You're the boss.
[201:13.14]Stop checking me out like that.
[201:15.90]You killed them?
[201:18.26]Such a gentleman.
[201:20.00]Are you asking out of tactical curiosity?
[201:22.58]Or are you just fucking with me?
[201:26.44]Bet they didn't offer much resistance.
[201:29.14]You got a problem with that?
[201:31.74]You got no idea how hard it is to hide your true self around here.
[201:37.00]Hey, I'm not accusing anybody.
[201:38.78]How?
[201:42.28]A real gentleman.
[201:44.79]I just turned my back, but you didn't strike.
[201:48.13]You are fucking with me.
[201:50.17]It's actually pretty hard to take cheap shots when your enemy is as bloodthirsty as yourself.
[201:56.41]People like us think alike.
[201:58.80]Don't they?
[201:59.30]Why is there a cabin over here?
[202:00.34]Shall we?
[202:01.56]Does it need to be explained?
[202:02.44]Let's go.
[202:07.32]Huh?
[202:07.48]A lifesaver.
[202:07.88]You will pay with your life!
[202:09.34]At last I have my chance.
[202:12.86]I will now avenge my father!
[202:15.94]Something tells me you watch too many samurai movies, little girl.
[202:34.30]Robin Akandaz really does add so much to this character.
[202:38.45]Seriously.
[202:39.45]That like- ROLLY!
[202:42.25]Only he could do that.
[202:57.46]Easy.
[202:59.28]Low?
[202:59.82]I think she stays low mostly.
[203:10.39]Yep.
[203:11.37]Oh, shit.
[203:14.89]Oh, that hurts.
[203:16.71]What's with my stamina?
[203:17.53]My beam stamina?
[203:30.37]Get it!
[203:35.08]Whoa!
[203:39.12]Slow.
[203:39.72]This song's really good.
[203:44.89]It is pretty good.
[204:00.26]No mercy, no mercy, no mercy, no mercy.
[204:02.53]Ow.
[204:02.85]Alright, don't fuck around.
[204:04.87]Can we move?
[204:27.03]What?
[204:27.21]I didn't catch you in a combo?
[204:28.07]What?
[204:36.89]Watch that battery power.
[204:39.81]Oh, fuck, that hurt.
[204:44.63]Oooh, did I get it?
[204:53.16]Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[204:54.90]I need to charge.
[205:09.61]Shit.
[205:10.19]Not good.
[205:11.17]What the hell?
[205:16.52]That fucking battery.
[205:23.72]Oi!
[205:51.87]Oh, fuck, don't do it.
[205:54.03]Don't do it.
[205:55.85]Oh, fuck, what you doing?
[205:57.37]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[205:59.49]Don't kill me.
[205:59.95]Please don't kill me.
[206:01.41]Is that a kill?
[206:01.89]Is that an instant kill?
[206:07.17]Where am I?
[206:07.45]Oh, this is helpful.
[206:24.56]Oh shit, my fucking pants.
[206:28.94]Oh shit, I tried to dodge it.
[206:30.47]I'm dead, I'm dead.
[206:32.73]I'm dead.
[206:39.83]Fuck, I tried, I dodged it.
[206:42.31]Shit.
[206:50.26]Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[206:59.69]This health right over here.
[207:00.87]Fuck this.
[207:02.17]Fuck that.
[207:04.47]You actually just hit me.
[207:06.25]How dare you.
[207:07.18]Well done.
[207:07.72]Bastard!
[207:32.05]This is Dora!
[208:01.00]Back up.
[208:01.34]Battery.
[208:03.34]Still good on health.
[208:08.57]Shit!
[208:30.52]Sonic Sword is the best option if you go in.
[208:33.50]Oh, shit!
[208:34.46]My pants.
[208:34.96]I'm good.
[208:35.26]Battery.
[208:35.72]Get it out of the way.
[209:06.23]Don't blow it like last time.
[209:38.11]Dead.
[209:39.45]Why is she invincible?
[209:48.89]I'm good.
[209:56.38]My hair!
[210:00.14]What are you waiting for?
[210:01.88]Finish me!
[210:03.34]Finish you?
[210:04.68]Don't look at me like that!
[210:06.68]Don't!
[210:08.11]I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding.
[210:11.33]I never fought your father.
[210:13.37]Liar!
[210:14.55]You... you killed him!
[210:16.70]Sliced him in two!
[210:18.04]You sick bastard!
[210:21.34]Whoa, whoa!
[210:22.60]Calm down a little.
[210:26.44]Jacobs was my mentor.
[210:28.24]I'd never kill him.
[210:35.52]I watched Master Jacob's teachings on video over and over till the fucking tape wore out.
[210:40.92]We never met in person.
[210:42.40]I watched him over and over again.
[210:44.66]I admit it.
[210:45.12]I lost.
[210:48.06]Just do it.
[210:49.24]How about kill yourself after you kill me?
[210:52.80]Sounds like a bit straight out of a samurai movie, don't it?
[210:55.96]Shut up!
[210:56.58]Shut up and kill me already!
[210:58.68]You've already dishonored me enough.
[211:01.47]Do it yourself.
[211:03.14]I watched Master jermaOn stream over and over.
[211:06.92]What would you learn?
[211:10.73]How to wicked easily get headaches?
[211:13.63]How to sneeze and get a hernia?
[211:16.73]Which one?
[211:27.67]That's A. Clear time.
[211:29.01]A. How to slap yourself.
[211:33.09]How to put together masterful comedy.
[211:35.03]Yeah, I see what you're saying now.
[211:37.73]Thanks, appreciate that.
[211:46.27]HP upgrade.
[211:52.91]How to backtrack.
[211:55.23]Not yet.
[211:55.63]What else is in here?
[212:06.99]I can't talk.
[212:07.51]I think we just leave.
[212:15.09]Jeremy, you must go forward.
[212:21.19]Which Dark Souls did I beat on stream again?
[212:25.72]Multiple.
[212:26.32]More than one.
[212:33.77]Probably not.
[212:34.77]She's still young.
[212:36.13]But I still have to follow the association's rules of conduct.
[212:40.06]Then let her live.
[212:41.88]Are we suddenly in love, Travis?
[212:43.60]Wait, this was that guy?
[212:44.66]Welcome to the channel.
[212:46.10]So why take the risk of her coming back for revenge?
[212:49.00]In this business, there's no such thing as mercy.
[212:52.92]Kill when you can kill.
[212:54.88]That's bullshit.
[212:56.48]All I want to do is fight someone better than me.
[213:00.01]She'll grow up.
[213:01.29]Why not kill her when she's stronger?
[213:04.21]Oh, damn.
[213:05.07]Yeah, got him.
[213:32.80]Number eight.
[213:36.52]Shinobu.
[213:38.48]Not anymore.
[213:39.14]Moving up.
[213:51.55]Gonna be hard missing her arm.
[213:56.91]Yeah, but we'll just get a robot one.
[214:00.60]Or we've trained with the other hand.
[214:08.13]Why is there an ad for the game in the game?
[214:19.24]Ah, is there?
[214:20.52]I didn't see it.
[214:20.86]This is Diane from Beathead Videos.
[214:22.78]Just calling to let you know that one of the videos returned yesterday wasn't one of ours.
[214:28.16]It doesn't have a label on it, but it seems to be a recording of a guy humping a pillow.
[214:35.92]The video you should have returned was, um, How to Please a Woman in Bed 101 Part 2.
[214:41.61]Please return it to us soon.
[214:43.09]Thank you.
[214:43.63]Jesus Christ.
[214:46.85]Congratulations, Mr. Touchdown.
[214:49.27]Your registration for the 8th UAA rank is now complete.
[214:53.25]In addition, we have faxed you some information about the rankings in case you wish to continue your ascent.
[214:59.68]Please transfer the money into the designated account.
[215:03.82]Have a nice day.
[215:06.23]300 grand?
[215:06.51]500 grand?
[215:07.37]It's probably three... 250?
[215:08.71]I'm gonna say 250.
[215:09.63]250!
[215:09.69]Entry fee for your next ranked flight is $250,000.
[215:16.49]Alright.
[215:27.61]Just lounge it.
[215:28.45]Every time we come back, we have to play with the cat.
[215:34.16]The phone recording guy is Ryden's VA from Metal Gear Solid 2.
[215:40.70]Pretty cool.
[215:54.61]Ant 4 and Rising.
[215:55.81]Yeah.
[215:56.81]Pretty cool.
[216:01.98]Gold Town is now open.
[216:04.22]Beef Head is now open.
[216:07.08]New part-time job is available.
[216:13.50]Is there any... Is there a new sword available?
[216:17.75]Let's check.
[216:18.91]Let's check Beef Town.
[216:24.81]Excuse me.
[216:28.02]Am I gonna finish this game tonight?
[216:30.22]Uh, probably not.
[216:32.18]No, no way.
[216:36.16]No.
[216:38.14]We'll do, we'll, we'll probably, I would assume we'll get it probably exactly, it's like a 12 hour game, right?
[216:43.47]It's like 10 to 13, 10 to 14 hours, something like that?
[216:49.93]Probably do it over two screens.
[216:51.67]Travis!
[216:52.86]How's business?
[216:56.66]Hey, how's biz?
[216:57.46]By the way, that thing you wanted hasn't come in yet.
[216:59.94]So what will it be today?
[217:03.48]Video, Volume 1.
[217:05.00]The title is Mask de Panther.
[217:09.18]The Tiger's Roar.
[217:12.65]Can I get it?
[217:17.39]That's chillin', Travis.
[217:18.37]You've got the eye, man.
[217:19.47]The eye for cool.
[217:20.11]Alright, let's get it.
[217:23.05]Let's go watch it, too.
[217:24.59]Don't die out there.
[217:26.09]Come back again.
[217:28.25]Oh, for wrestling moves here.
[217:29.31]That makes sense.
[217:33.77]Alright, we also have to go to somewhere over here.
[217:39.30]I want to check the katana place.
[217:43.10]Let's see if there's any new stuff.
[217:51.06]Is this going to be a 100% gameplay type deal or are you just going to beat it?
[217:55.59]Um...
[217:59.62]I wouldn't say 100%.
[218:02.13]But I'm going to play it until I don't care.
[218:04.27]I mean, I'm going to play... Ooh, there it is.
[218:05.95]T-shirt.
[218:09.43]Enough until I'm done.
[218:11.41]Because I do want to play the second one, too.
[218:13.85]Probably not 100%.
[218:25.54]Don't lay a finger on anything, I'll kill you.
[218:29.27]Alright, you got anything new?
[218:31.23]You do not have anything new.
[218:32.77]Any new parts?
[218:33.75]You do have new parts.
[218:37.65]Power-up parts for Tsubaki...
[218:42.61]Exchanges the crystal parts inside the beam katana with pure crystals to greatly increase its output.
[219:04.60]Energy saving part.
[219:08.37]So this is for longer battery life.
[219:12.32]Adds a... I thought that said motherfucker.
[219:14.52]Adds a motherfucker to the beam katana.
[219:17.38]Increases... I'll get this one.
[219:19.46]This is the power one.
[219:21.82]Let's give it extraordinary power.
[219:23.72]I don't have enough for the other one.
[219:32.65]Adds a fuckhead to the katana.
[219:40.45]I don't have enough money to get it.
[219:42.72]We have to do more jobs.
[219:49.24]Can we get a little wink?
[219:50.08]I see 1,200 points, not 75,000.
[219:50.65]Yes, you do.
[219:51.19]I don't know.
[219:51.91]I don't want it.
[219:52.93]No, I don't want it.
[219:54.67]I don't want it.
[219:55.23]I don't want it.
[219:56.45]Wait, what?
[219:56.75]You have 125,000.
[219:56.97]I need money.
[219:57.23]Wait, how much money do I have?
[220:16.46]Oh, fuck, okay.
[220:17.16]I don't know why I thought that was 12,000, not 125.
[220:24.57]You need 75,000 points.
[220:25.83]Go fuck yourself for raising the bit amount for highlighted messages, you asshole.
[220:32.37]Um... Uh... What?
[220:41.64]What, you don't want to see a sea of purple highlighted messages in chat?
[220:44.88]Wallstream?
[220:46.49]What do you do?
[220:53.16]Yeah, essentially before it was... this chat was just purple text.
[220:58.76]That's what it was.
[221:00.34]See, now it's intended purpose of... and here we go.
[221:03.06]Here we go.
[221:03.52]Open up the slot gates.
[221:04.38]Let's go.
[221:09.78]Imagine not having enough channel points.
[221:16.35]Well, hold on a minute here.
[221:17.53]I... I... I decreased... I increased the one for highlighting a chat message, but I DECREASED the unlo- what, the, uh, changing an emote?
[221:30.29]That used to be 1250, that's now 750.
[221:36.18]Just save for the wink.
[221:38.48]I told you, there's a huge play here.
[221:41.08]Where, if you guys just don't spend your channel points,
[221:44.65]In, like, two years, you can all spend them to get me to wink.
[221:49.19]And it'll ruin an entire stream.
[221:54.61]That will... It'll ruin everything.
[221:56.77]You're guaranteed to fuck up at least one full entire livestream.
[222:01.47]Like, in six months.
[222:06.15]Huh?
[222:11.72]What do you want?
[222:14.25]What do you want?
[222:15.89]Make it in the hundreds.
[222:18.16]I'm not gonna... Go home to mommy.
[222:22.14]Leave me alone.
[222:23.06]I want to enjoy this moment.
[222:25.96]I already got 6k.
[222:26.94]You got 6k.
[222:29.72]Find the seven Lopikov balls scattered across Santa Destroy and bring them to this drunk.
[222:34.41]That's...
[222:43.26]How many points for a date?
[222:52.64]Uh... 500 million channel points?
[222:56.13]Which would take probably 10 years of me streaming, so... I don't think you'll ever get that.
[223:10.31]Alright.
[223:11.81]Training.
[223:17.09]Here we go.
[223:17.67]Bench press.
[223:19.03]Increasing your strength.
[223:19.87]Let's go.
[223:21.27]Tapping, tapping, tapping, tapping.
[223:24.95]Just pool your points.
[223:27.09]No, it has to be from one single account.
[223:28.94]You can't just pool all your points.
[223:42.71]How much to have a chat message go through text-to-speech?
[223:46.01]Well, that would mean that I would have to have text-to-speech turned on in the stream, and there is... That is never going to happen.
[224:00.56]Why?
[224:04.58]Uh...
[224:07.03]Because I don't like it?
[224:10.11]We've talked about this already.
[224:11.27]There's somebody just talking while you're talking at the same time.
[224:16.50]Somebody could just be talking over me talking.
[224:19.20]Telling two completely different things at the same time.
[224:34.98]You already randomly just picked stuff from chat to read anyways.
[224:37.96]It's pretty much text-to-speech already.
[224:39.57]Except it's text to Jeremy.
[224:57.20]And there's another reason why I don't like text-to-speech, because not just for the stream, but a majority of these streams are cut down and put on YouTube.
[225:06.45]And... it's... watching a video where there's just a TTS just talking on an edited video, it's just... it's messy.
[225:17.56]It's messy.
[225:36.33]Now he cares about YouTube.
[225:40.24]I mean, I care about the channel being like a watchable channel for people that don't want to watch streams.
[225:47.45]Yes, of course I do.
[225:48.83]Yes, I do.
[225:54.75]The intended purpose of that channel is to make it so people that don't have time, or don't want to catch a stream, they... You know, I've got... I only got maybe 15, 10, 20 minutes of time, and... Oh, but I did want to see some highlights from that.
[226:07.88]There you go.
[226:08.40]That's for you.
[226:09.12]There's VODs on Twitch.
[226:13.61]Yeah, for 60 days.
[226:15.37]And then they get cut down.
[226:16.27]If you don't got time to sit through a 6, 7 plus hour stream, you know?
[226:24.89]Barry, get the fuck out of here.
[226:26.19]Alright, how did I get bronze on this one?
[226:29.90]Disgusting.
[226:52.24]I actually watch the YouTube highlights, even if I watch the stream.
[226:56.70]It's for anybody that wants to... If you wanted to catch up on something, if... You know, let's say you wanted to watch the last few streams, but... Or the last, you know, let's say, oh yeah, I heard about that Simpsons hit-and-run stream, where didn't he, like, fucking bite his controller?
[227:12.73]Oh, wait, it's a 13-hour VOD?
[227:14.59]I... I don't really want to do that.
[227:20.71]I got like 10 minutes today, though.
[227:35.72]Went the wrong way.
[227:36.52]Shit!
[227:42.22]Make Channel Point 100k for a Nancy Drew game.
[227:46.97]No, I can't start doing that.
[227:49.35]Because if it's like, oh, for 100, I'll play League of Legends at 100,000 channel points.
[227:55.42]I don't want to do that.
[228:00.40]Nancy Drew is fine, but you open up the can of worms there.
[228:04.24]Are you prepared?
[228:10.55]No!
[228:15.10]Don't kill that, uh, CBO yet.
[228:16.64]Look at how much fucking pain that is.
[228:19.02]He's got to extend his chance.
[228:26.93]No wrestling moves, they take too much time.
[228:30.29]Fuck!
[228:30.81]Ow!
[228:30.97]I'm sorry.
[228:33.20]Do it!
[228:33.52]Don't kill the CEO.
[228:40.00]That's a gold right there.
[229:11.63]100k points and you have to be Jump King DLC?
[229:17.35]A bronze!

[251:13.13]I'm like eight feet tall.
[251:15.11]Why am I so tall right now?

[251:28.38]I'm gonna focus here.
[251:34.80]Terrible route.
[251:36.91]This is not how you get 50.
[251:49.80]What an awful fucking route.
[251:51.45]I'm embarrassed.
[251:52.11]I'm actually embarrassed right now.
[251:55.25]My face is, like, slowly starting to turn red.
[251:57.31]And my speech is starting to get a little different.
[252:02.57]You know what I mean?
[252:02.99]Like, I'm getting nervous and... God damn it.
[252:10.62]Ow!

[252:16.96]What the fuck was that?
[252:28.05]Don't re- whatever.
[252:28.77]There's an electric fence.
[252:33.25]I wonder what the speedrunners of this game do.
[252:45.30]Do you just rush to garbage and collect garbage like 50 times as the best possible route, and then just blow through the rest of the game?
[252:56.88]Which speedrun?
[252:57.64]It has to be a speedrun.
[252:58.70]This game's popular.
[253:00.74]This is a fairly... I mean, it's not insanely popular, but it's popular enough.
[253:09.23]Probably a glitch.
[253:10.29]Yeah.
[253:22.97]I've seen Roblox games look better than this.
[253:29.23]that's just it's just objectively incorrect are you gonna are you actually gonna be like talk about no more heroes like that it's unbelievable

[254:39.07]Alright, let's pay that fee.
[254:50.00]And move on to assassin number 7.
[255:21.95]Let it die is bad.
[255:22.89]I streamed let it die.
[255:30.50]The first six... Probably the first four hours of let it die was fun, sort of.
[255:39.39]And then it just kind of... it... it was not... I didn't... didn't keep me.
[255:45.75]Didn't keep me at all.
[255:46.63]I can just walk across the goddamn street.
[255:58.54]It's right here.
[256:05.24]They really need to let it die.
[256:12.71]It was good for 30 levels, and then it got really into free-to-play mobile game territory.
[256:16.59]Yeah, that's what I heard.
[256:19.67]What happened?
[256:23.39]Did you respawn as an ant?

[257:32.66]This is a squeaky cat.
[257:33.88]We need to put some oil around the hinges there.

[269:10.50]Let's see if- is it a move list?
[269:15.11]Ranking, side job, config, data, exit.
[269:20.75]I don't think there is.
[269:29.57]Data?
[269:30.67]Nah, data's, um, save files.
[269:35.62]There's a move list.
[269:36.20]It's called Google.
[269:38.76]Yeah, but if it was in the game, it'd be easy for me to just grab.
[269:41.16]You know what I mean, Vern?
[269:47.88]Is it random each time?
[269:48.90]It might be.

[272:31.34]You think you're tough, huh?
[272:39.62]You think you're tough, huh?
[272:46.09]Jeremiah, you're getting lit tonight.
[272:49.53]If by lit you mean eat a bowl of spaghetti and go to sleep, then sure.
[273:10.63]I think that's what they mean.
[273:11.75]Yeah.
[273:12.19]Yeah.
[273:12.49]Well, yeah.
[273:13.01]Then yeah.
[273:14.01]Alright.
[273:15.49]Three lightsabers.
[273:16.19]Be careful.
[273:16.69]Why?
[273:16.85]Why?
[273:38.91]He keeps saying it.
[273:47.36]It's fucking me up, man.
[273:48.42]I'm gonna lose.
[273:50.10]I haven't saved in a little while.
[273:51.36]Hold on.
[274:10.01]Get outta here!
[274:29.66]Damn.
[274:34.71]I'll kick you in the nuts!
[274:36.29]Hey, you!
[274:36.77]I'll kick you in the nuts!
[274:40.11]It's so stupid.
[274:42.95]And they speak so quickly, too.
[274:44.33]It's like, hey you!
[274:44.87]It's almost like it's sped ups.
[274:45.65]Fuck, don't get cocky.
[275:10.52]Get up Oh, I had to finish that
[275:41.62]These guys actually have a lot of health They have really thick spleens
[276:12.44]to the mini-bosses.
[276:13.20]I'm glad they got nerfed in the sequel.
[276:16.08]They are quite tricky.
[276:17.81]Is there somebody alive?
[276:23.11]Oh, god.
[276:23.55]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[276:33.44]Oh.
[276:33.90]Okay, I blocked it, but it knocked me down.
[276:38.30]Jesus, that's fast.
[276:39.42]Alright, I gotta...
[276:52.43]Get him!
[276:55.78]Easy.
[276:56.98]No, don't get cocky!
[277:00.44]I don't wanna lose here.
[277:08.00]I can't!
[277:09.05]Stop!
[277:09.65]You fucker!
[277:20.56]I have to meet him.
[277:21.94]Hello!
[277:51.62]I'll kick you in the nut.
[277:58.18]That's such stupid trash talk.
[278:00.24]That's... We're about to get in a fight.
[278:04.41]You and me.
[278:06.03]One on one here.
[278:06.83]Yeah, let's go.
[278:08.01]Let's go.
[278:08.27]You got your hands up?
[278:09.09]I'm gonna kick you in the nuts.
[278:10.43]It's like... Fuck you, dude.
[278:13.01]Get out of here.
[278:14.11]What are you doing?
[278:16.53]You fucking...
[278:19.15]You shouldn't aim for things that are obviously beyond your grasp.
[278:23.09]But ignore idiots like that.
[278:25.10]Don't accept defeat before the first punch has even been thrown.
[278:28.50]Hello?
[278:31.26]Anybody home?
[278:32.16]Did you even hear what I just said?
[278:35.36]It's mind games.
[278:36.32]He never actually does that.
[278:38.62]This is why third rates like you are hopeless.
[278:42.14]I am 120% certain you are going to die.
[278:56.69]Of course I'm going to read it.
[278:58.97]But what are you doing?
[279:00.23]I'm going to read that.
[279:02.01]People that think, oh, this streamer doesn't read chat.
[279:05.60]I'd read almost everything.
[279:07.38]Almost.
[279:08.00]Maybe like 40% of everything.
[279:10.88]Close enough.
[279:18.26]New move.
[279:22.36]Travis, remember now, the most fundamental among fundamental suplexes made famous in Calgary.
[279:27.31]It's the all-natural amusement machine, the Jerma suplex.
[279:30.39]I don't even know how to do that.
[279:34.11]Don't I already know how to do it?
[279:42.75]I've done that a few times.
[279:56.81]That's a Dragon Suplex, huh.
[279:59.77]Dermot Suplex is just around the waist, right?
[280:02.09]And backwards?
[280:18.02]It's not even full health.
[280:19.94]Hopefully I get it for a cutscene.
[280:21.70]Because that would suck if I don't.
[280:26.26]Rank 7.
[280:26.64]Destroy map.
[280:39.03]I thought I wouldn't make it here on time.
[280:40.97]Had to take care of some customers that filed complaints.
[280:44.59]My apologies.
[280:46.17]So much to do with so little help.
[280:48.29]I can't stand these people with all their nonsense complaints.
[280:53.15]They think they can just say anything.
[280:54.83]It's crazy.
[280:56.09]But anyway, I'm here.
[280:57.55]I made it on time.
[280:59.11]That's the important thing, right?
[281:01.41]I take it you're Mr. Eight?
[281:03.57]You?
[281:04.59]You're ranked?
[281:05.87]Not me.
[281:07.27]Well, actually, it is me.
[281:09.39]Oh, I remember this guy.
[281:10.31]This guy's great.
[281:11.53]Never mind, then.
[281:12.47]You've got a job to do.
[281:13.95]But first, I need some time to get ready.
[281:15.97]Would you mind turning the other way?
[281:17.21]I need some privacy.
[281:18.85]Privacy?
[281:19.93]Yes.
[281:21.03]I need to prepare.
[281:22.35]Whatever.
[281:23.71]Don't mind me.
[281:24.87]Pretend I'm not even here.
[281:26.83]I just need you to look the other way for a second.
[281:28.99]A second?
[281:30.09]Yes, just a split second.
[281:32.54]I don't think it's too much to ask, do you?
[281:35.15]Then we can get on with our fight?
[281:37.65]That is correct.
[281:39.33]Alright.
[281:44.02]Bastard.
[281:45.16]Dishonor.
[281:47.36]Oh, sorry.
[281:47.94]I was aiming for your nuts.
[281:49.98]Oh, damn it.
[281:52.78]Whoa, that was close.
[281:54.50]For a second there, I forgot that you were a killer.
[281:58.12]Sorry if I scared you.
[281:59.48]I didn't mean to do that.
[282:01.03]Something's wrong with me today.
[282:03.57]I let my guard down.
[282:05.39]Getting sloppy.
[282:07.07]I gotta stay on my toes.
[282:07.85]He changed fast.
[282:10.87]You mind if I ask you something?
[282:12.79]Yeah, what is it, Mr. Cosplay?
[282:14.93]We're both assassins, right?
[282:17.08]Why do we have to kill each other anyway?
[282:18.70]This game is ridiculous.
[282:19.72]I love it.
[282:20.36]It's absolutely meaningless.
[282:22.34]It's about determining who's best.
[282:24.40]That's what it's about.
[282:26.50]Can't argue with that.
[282:28.38]Well then, let's get started.
[282:32.35]He just tried to kill me from behind.
[283:05.60]Oh, this is great.
[283:07.00]Is this guy an idiot or what?
[283:08.98]Hey, look, it's chat.
[283:10.28]Is this a joke?
[283:11.54]You fell for the oldest trick in the book.
[283:13.62]Oh, man, you are something.
[283:16.20]Oh, this is the best.
[283:17.74]Man, you really crack me up.
[283:20.42]I think this laughter's gonna kill me.
[283:23.38]Seriously, I think I might really die from laughter.
[283:27.34]It hurts.
[283:29.20]Someone help.
[283:31.20]Oh, God.
[283:33.99]And look at you you look like you're dead I guess it's time for a wake-up call This is where it gets good good night
[284:05.40]This is just what it's like to play Smash Bros.
[284:07.44]Online.
[284:07.70]It's like, it's not fucking fun, man.
[284:10.59]Alright, destroy, man.
[284:11.65]Let's go.
[284:38.49]Destroy Pound!
[284:42.06]Watch it.
[284:43.08]He's got a few, he's got like... Alright, he doesn't want to be in when he does that.
[284:46.80]He does like three or four different moves.
[284:52.60]Ooh, I have to dodge underneath that.
[284:54.78]Or I think I can block it.
[284:55.51]Okay, I think I can block the beam.
[284:59.61]Can I block that?
[285:09.86]Alright, destroy Spark, you gotta get behind him.
[285:12.66]Just dodge around him.
[285:16.67]Eee!

[285:51.76]Yes!
[285:56.59]Oh, shit!

[285:59.77]Here we go.
[286:06.13]Phase two.
[286:10.65]Does he hear he starts flying around or something?
[286:20.61]Shit, I don't remember.
[286:21.35]I don't know.
[286:24.79]Okay, you gotta get the bug.

[287:15.96]Oh, fuck!
[287:19.24]Oh, fuck!
[287:21.24]I need the health.
[287:24.33]I can block that.
[287:25.63]To stay up.
[287:26.41]I need the health.
[287:38.20]Block it.
[287:39.64]Block it.
[287:46.29]What is that?
[287:48.35]Oh my fucking lord!
[287:50.85]Hide somewhere?
[288:00.52]Can I run around it?
[288:11.09]That's a very well-made table, yeah.
[288:20.93]Oh, I'm dead!
[288:21.93]No, I'm not.
[288:22.73]I'm fine.
[288:36.01]Calm down.
[288:37.28]Right there.
[288:37.92]Alright, keep it going.
[288:46.99]He's got a Phase 3.
[288:48.18]I gotta be closer.
[288:52.50]He's gonna hit me in the nuts.
[289:00.89]I'm not running into that shit.
[289:05.09]He's gonna do Destroy Buster right now.
[289:18.09]Come on, he's almost dead!
[289:19.29]Do it!
[289:41.07]He's dead.
[289:45.91]See you later.
[289:46.81]Bye, Destroy Man.
[289:51.95]Oh, you bastard, come on.
[289:54.90]I'm so scared to go over there.
[289:59.40]Don't do it.
[290:02.52]Goodbye.
[290:22.47]Give him the old one-two.
[290:23.51]Oh, that cutscene should have played earlier.
[290:28.42]Don't cry like that.
[290:30.38]You're a killer, aren't you?
[290:34.36]Help.
[290:36.26]What?
[290:38.22]Help.
[290:40.60]I can't hear you.
[290:42.80]Help me, please.

[290:48.59]Whatever.
[290:49.55]It's over anyway.

[291:58.21]I'm starting to think that you may be for real.
[292:03.57]That fight was nice.
[292:04.11]Yeah, that's fun.
[292:05.29]You are now seventh in rank.

[293:12.07]I don't want to risk messing the whole thing up.
[293:17.50]Um, this is Diane.

[293:58.63]As always, we have faxed you some information about the rankings in case you wish to continue your ascent.
[294:05.58]Please transfer the money into the designated account.
[294:08.10]Terma, get your nasty shit off the desk where you and Kim eat.
[294:10.50]Thank you.
[294:11.42]And have a nice day.
[294:12.94]We don't, we, me and Kim don't eat dinner up here on, where my computer desk is.
[294:19.73]Why would we do that?
[294:20.51]300 grand.
[294:30.91]You hungry?
[294:38.24]You're in your one room apartment.
[294:41.98]Well, wouldn't she just be in here?
[294:54.41]She is.
[294:59.97]Save it again.
[295:21.74]End of the stream?
[295:22.74]Not yet.
[295:29.15]Not yet.
[295:32.19]Oh man, that's end of the stream voice.
[295:34.39]No, how is that end of the stream voice?
[295:38.32]New job.
[295:38.98]What is it?
[295:41.02]Why do I unlock another katana?
[295:42.26]I'm almost rank 6.
[295:43.20]Where's the new katana?
[295:53.46]Where's the stupidest way to take a left?
[296:05.45]Move!
[296:21.61]Alright, we gotta go to the gym.
[296:22.95]We gotta get the katana part, if it's available.
[296:27.44]What, the new model?
[296:28.62]Dumbass otaku.
[296:29.74]What's it look like?
[296:30.98]Of course it's not done yet.
[296:32.00]Alright, well, fucking fine.
[296:38.20]You don't have to be such a dick.
[296:40.60]Alright, to the gym.
[296:55.39]No, no, no, don't!
[297:10.84]Okay.
[297:11.58]Back to the gym.
[297:21.95]So we're this way, take a right.
[297:24.88]Remember, drive on the right side of the road, what are you doing?
[297:27.30]Remember when I was playing Grand Theft Auto?
[297:29.94]And how furious people would get because I only drive on the left side of the road into traffic?
[297:34.84]I remember.
[297:39.96]It's because it's easier!
[297:40.86]You don't have to wait for people in front of you, you can just weave around.
[297:52.84]Alright.
[297:53.70]Bench press, again.
[298:19.43]Ah, this hurts.
[298:28.15]I'm not gonna make it?
[298:29.57]I have 30 seconds!
[298:41.34]Pepsi versus Coke?
[298:45.98]Um, Coke.
[299:02.53]It's the same.
[299:03.03]No, it's a little different.
[299:06.71]Coke is spicier than Pepsi.
[299:08.37]Pepsi is smoother.
[299:10.37]Coke has a little bit more of a bite than Pepsi does.
[299:12.27]Pepsi tastes almost like it's not flat.
[299:15.47]But it's like a little spicier.
[299:16.97]It's got a little more bite than Pepsi does.
[299:28.32]I wait for you.
[299:32.71]Dr. Pepper is the best.
[299:34.67]You know what?
[299:35.19]Actually, in recent years, you know what's really been taken over as the drink of choice for me for a soda?
[299:43.14]It's just regular-ass Sprite.
[299:46.27]I like it.
[299:47.11]It's crisp.
[299:49.19]It's refreshing.
[299:50.07]I actually really like it.
[299:52.24]Just a little bit.
[299:52.88]Just, you know, like those little baby cans?
[299:55.54]The ones that are, like, they look like they're, like, a jokey little display.
[299:58.96]Like a cartoon can.
[300:01.24]I like those.
[300:02.12]You just, that's it.
[300:03.16]Just a little one.
[300:04.64]Just enough.
[300:09.76]Alright, I need 300,000.
[300:10.86]Let's go do the new job.
[300:12.66]And we should unlock more assassin missions, which I haven't done all of them.
[300:23.06]LaCroix.
[300:24.02]No.
[300:24.75]No, no, no.
[300:25.51]I don't like soda water like that.
[300:28.43]For me, if I'm gonna drink soda, I gotta go all the way.
[300:32.53]Drinking something like LaCroix is, like, halfway for me.
[300:36.25]And it's just like, if I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna go the whole way.
[300:49.89]Where's Mountain Dew?
[300:50.63]No, Mountain Dew sucks now.
[300:53.29]I don't know.
[300:53.55]They somehow made it worse over the last 10 years.
[300:55.49]I don't know what they did.
[300:56.59]It's just too sugary.
[300:58.11]I don't know.
[300:58.53]It's like 44 grams of sugar or something.
[301:04.96]It's not too bad.
[301:05.94]The first rate god.
[301:07.22]That's me.
[301:08.18]Okay.
[301:09.98]Gas stand.
[301:10.60]Fill up cars with gas.
[301:13.66]$2,000 for each car filled up.
[301:14.97]Absolutely.
[301:21.09]You know what has objectively gotten worse?
[301:22.59]It's Cool Ranch Doritos.
[301:26.17]I don't... I haven't had Cool Ranch Doritos in a long time.
[301:28.45]When was the last time I had Cool Ranch Doritos?
[301:39.73]I don't even really eat regular Doritos anymore.
[301:42.15]I mean, I... Not really.
[301:49.06]Cheese it's a my snack choice if I just want to just crunch on something Well, you know what's awesome dill pickle lays potato chips They are very very very they're great They had trust me they're pretty good dill uh lace potato chips
[302:15.64]rules the unspoken rules stand to destroy dictate perseverance perseverance lends to money which certainly leads to wealth the world will forever remain closed to those who do not persevere the god of gasoline is cruel lose your perseverance and you'll burn up that is what perseverance means so get working get working kettle chips yeah I like kettle chips too they're they're up there like a tier press the b button to pump gas into the car be sure to fill her up just the right amount
[302:48.02]I don't even remember this one.
[303:01.92]Oops.
[303:03.26]That person didn't even get any gas.
[303:09.97]That person drove in and just drove out with the same amount.
[303:15.97]Fuck.
[303:16.55]This one actually sucks.
[303:29.91]Was that not it?
[303:31.34]That was perfect.
[303:31.84]That was like pixel perfect.
[303:48.85]You can go over, you just can't go under.
[303:50.87]Okay.
[303:52.19]Well, it said fill it to the right amount!
[303:54.84]I'm overfilling it.
[304:03.70]Isn't part of the job that it's supposed to suck?
[304:13.54]A little too much.
[304:19.92]I was going to say, yeah, that was a Mario damage sound.
[304:24.55]But I made a Mario reference like yesterday.
[304:27.29]You guys, I can't make too many in a row.
[304:42.42]That was perfect.
[304:43.71]That was close.
[304:51.09]It did sound just like it.
[304:52.97]What car?
[304:53.57]Look at this car!
[304:55.49]What was that car?
[304:56.63]That car didn't make any sense.
[304:57.73]That car was made out of marshmallows.
[305:08.72]God damn it.
[305:14.32]That's a birthday cake car.
[305:19.54]Big cake.
[305:20.74]That really is a car cake.
[305:23.22]It's a birthday cake.
[305:27.31]These are hard to do.
[305:28.21]Look, it's gonna blow up on me.
[305:37.34]Was it $3,000 per car?
[305:37.84]This is actually gonna be a lot of money.
[305:50.98]20, uh, probably 23.
[305:54.50]23!
[305:56.39]Just as many cars filled up as there are categories for the New Year's Eve stream.
[306:03.03]If you go ahead and check out the voting, there is a poll going on right now.
[306:08.89]23 categories.
[306:12.89]Get your votes in.
[306:14.67]The best and worst shit that happened on this stream over the last year.
[306:20.87]lot of interesting stuff on there take that poll poll is open until the 31st at 12 p.m Pacific and then that evening Pacific we will watch the ball drop and go over all the nominations and see what you guys selected he's doing an ad I'm doing an ad for my own stream so the money just went in a circle
[306:46.18]23 if you start from zero.
[306:47.48]Well, 24 if you count the, uh, would you recommend Jerma to a friend.
[306:59.05]Ooh, a new mission.
[307:01.63]Nice.
[307:03.67]New assassin mission.
[307:04.63]Hopefully it's worth $100,000.
[307:05.71]Good job.
[307:05.99]What do we got?
[307:16.26]So we left at pizza but returns.
[307:19.36]Kill as many as you can within the time limit.
[307:20.82]Mission ends when time runs out.
[307:22.04]So I just need to kill as many people as possible.
[307:24.81]4,000 per kill.
[307:25.71]That's a lot.
[307:27.51]Kill a hundred enemies.
[307:28.97]Mission ends when all targets are dead.
[307:32.01]No time limit.
[307:33.09]That's a hundred people.
[307:34.31]That's a lot of people though.
[307:35.59]I feel like that's not good.
[307:38.55]Go on a batting killing spree.
[307:39.87]We've done this before.
[307:42.56]I'll do this one.
[307:43.24]This is the power-up.
[308:12.31]Let's go.
[308:15.31]Travis.
[308:17.13]The 100 enemy one is the one I used for big money.
[308:21.67]Well, eventually, when you get strong enough, you upgrade your attack power and you upgrade your katana to a point where you can kill people in one hit.
[308:29.90]So, that mission probably becomes pretty easy money once you have, like, the third katana and plus seven in attack power.
[308:40.69]Big money.
[308:42.17]We'll try this one.
[309:03.36]3k per kill is more money than 90k for 100.
[309:09.14]That's true, but you do have a time limit on the other one, no wonder.
[309:11.49]Alright, Dark Side, here we go.
[309:16.45]Trying to remember the Wii buttons, like Z, C, it's...
[309:37.51]At least we get to see these animations.
[309:38.79]No, don't slap the button.
[309:45.44]Did I kill both?
[309:58.85]For some reason, B is the trigger on the Wii.
[310:02.81]But B for me, I don't know.
[310:04.47]I feel like it's A. It's the face button up here at my thumb.
[310:10.61]It's been a while since I've held a Wii controller.
[310:12.87]It's been like two years, right?
[310:14.67]Where's the last Wii stream?
[310:22.34]What was the last Wii stream?
[310:23.54]I've never played the WarioWares.
[310:34.56]What else did I play on Wii?
[310:35.42]I did the new Mad Dog games, right?
[310:37.94]All those LaserDisc ones.
[310:43.13]Dill pickle flavored Lay's tastes like ass and you know it, you tasteless boomer.
[310:46.75]Why can't I move?
[310:59.16]Did I not play Rhythm Heaven?
[311:03.06]I bet you 20 was gold, too.
[311:04.40]Fuck.
[311:06.08]We need... Well, are you aware?
[311:06.82]I already played it.
[311:08.04]I did all of it.
[311:13.34]You didn't.
[311:14.30]I'll do it.
[311:14.66]I swear to God, I didn't... Didn't I play it?
[311:22.04]The one for Wii.
[311:26.42]The...
[311:27.82]Is that true?
[311:29.18]Post for the fans.
[311:30.36]Am I just thinking of a cool part of that game that I didn't play?
[311:33.02]Didn't I play that?
[311:40.57]No, we made videos of it.
[311:43.41]Oh, that's right.
[311:44.29]It was a green screen entry.
[311:50.98]Well, we'll play it.
[311:51.46]Yeah, we'll play it.

[314:36.27]Oh, damn it.
[314:37.27]That was the end, too.
[314:38.23]Shit.
[314:49.27]I'll get this one.
[314:49.89]Oh, I'm so disappointed by that.
[314:51.21]And I'm... I got...
[315:01.28]Fuck this message, but it's funny.
[315:03.50]Don't read this.
[315:04.60]You now have bad luck for the next three days.
[315:06.56]This is real voodoo.
[315:07.86]You can only undo this by spinning around three times on camera while screaming.
[315:17.52]That's stupid.
[315:20.26]Oh no, I've been cursed.
[315:25.33]Don't get hit.
[315:29.26]Dude, it's real voodoo.
[315:30.40]I have to be careful.
[315:31.18]Alright, I gotta pay attention because I want this 50 grand.
[315:34.80]You almost baited me there, didn't you?
[315:39.98]That was risky, but it was worth it.
[315:53.67]Don't fucking do this to me.
[316:02.38]Get the guy with the lightsaber first.
[316:03.40]Back it up!
[316:07.41]No, I'll do it.
[316:37.08]I'm not doing that.
[316:37.81]Fuck.
[316:38.03]I don't care.
[316:38.47]Curse me.
[316:43.49]I can't do that here right now.
[316:44.91]There's not enough room.
[316:48.09]You can... Look how big my arms are.
[317:00.49]Oh!
[317:07.18]Okay, take your curse off, motherfucker.
[317:19.91]I have removed the curse!
[317:21.27]Oh, thank god.
[317:34.98]Where's my bike?
[317:43.21]What, do I have two chairs in the room?
[317:45.49]Sometimes Kim comes up here and sits down and we, um, hang out, look at stuff, play a game, or... Oh, there's a ball.
[317:59.12]Jerma, it's time for you to eat dinner.
[318:01.64]Um, it's not time for me to eat... I'm gonna do this one more mission and then we're gonna finish this tomorrow.
[318:09.49]And by mission I mean, like, assassin number six.
[318:14.86]Not one more of these money missions.
[318:16.96]I mean, like, a full assassin weighs another ball.
[318:27.25]Do you eat dinner at your desk?
[318:29.13]I don't eat dinner at my desk.
[318:32.95]Alright, let me get one of these.
[318:33.73]I haven't done one of these in a long time.
[318:35.37]I did, like, the first two or three in a row without a problem.
[318:44.53]Alright, come on.
[318:45.28]Don't get hit.
[318:52.30]Don't get hit.
[318:54.18]Hit.
[318:55.93]I'm going to kill you.
[319:19.35]Gotcha!
[319:25.11]God, that was lucky.
[319:41.85]It's okay.
[319:42.43]Fuck, I'm just going to do a regular mission.
[319:43.85]These are too... I need to... Oh my god, damn it.
[319:52.11]These ones are fucking hard.
[320:00.91]That's worse meltdown?
[320:02.01]What?
[320:04.49]I'm just expelling demons out of my mouth.
[320:06.47]How is that a meltdown?
[320:11.58]I'm just gonna go pick up trash.
[320:12.78]It's reliable.
[320:21.97]I need, like, $15.
[320:23.49]You know what?
[320:24.18]Just get it out of dumpsters.
[320:26.96]Yeah, let's just get it out of a dumpster.
[320:40.27]Yeah, I need to do this in, like, three dumpsters.
[320:53.87]Go play LEGO Star Wars The Complete Saga.
[320:55.93]It's the best game I've played this whole decade.
[321:01.85]No, not right now.
[321:09.12]Okay.
[321:12.64]Just two more.
[321:14.76]What is back here?
[321:19.36]What's on the mini-map there?
[321:27.90]You gotta play the Lord of the Rings games?
[321:31.66]Yeah, the Lord of the Rings PS2 games are on the list.
[321:35.72]And so is Mickey Mouse.
[321:37.42]The Magical Quest starring Mickey Mouse.
[321:51.04]It's a hell of a game, yeah.
[321:52.22]It's really good.
[321:57.26]You have a lot to play, yeah.
[321:58.37]There's a lot of games to play.
[322:00.05]Alright, give me my bike.
[322:08.81]Feel bad for that guy.
[322:32.20]I just need one more... I need two more dumpsters.
[322:35.02]And then get me on to the next battle.
[322:39.72]I need a dumpster.
[322:42.13]Anywhere.
[322:42.79]Dumpster.
[322:43.81]There's gotta be a dumpster in here.
[322:49.63]Play Peggle?
[322:50.17]I've played Peggle at least a few times.
[322:52.25]Fuck me.
[322:55.29]Come on.
[323:06.97]Seriously, what was that?
[323:13.48]Ball in here.
[323:19.48]I must... I have a... I got like four of these in a row.
[323:29.41]Where's WarioWare?
[323:30.15]I already streamed WarioWare.
[323:31.35]I did all of it.
[323:41.14]Did you play Urban Chaos?
[323:43.04]I think so.
[323:43.60]It was on the PS2 list.
[323:51.64]Do it more.
[323:53.16]Well, tell Nintendo to make them!
[323:55.90]They made one 12 years ago.
[324:00.00]And then they made a fake half WarioWare game.
[324:08.90]Where's the WarioWare Switch?
[324:10.88]Where is it?
[324:20.23]I'll be fair to Nintendo, though.
[324:21.39]There's probably... I mean, how many more different types of weird microgames do you think they can come up with?
[324:31.40]Maybe they could do some more?
[324:32.50]But, I don't know.
[324:37.22]They could, but maybe they just don't feel like it.
[324:42.22]But they have had a bunch of new games released.
[324:44.14]They could do a lot of... It's a t-shirt.
[324:48.83]It's kind of not what I wanted.
[324:49.85]Thumbster.
[325:08.49]Give me a dumpster.
[325:10.56]I need two dumpsters.
[325:11.74]There's one.
[325:17.60]Alright, I need $400.
[325:23.85]Yes!
[325:38.43]Blind, dumb, blind, dumb, blind, dumb, blind, dumb, blind, dumb.
[325:48.27]Where do you see this?
[325:50.08]Where did I miss one?
[325:59.78]Trying to have a meltdown while I'm going to bed?
[326:01.52]Oh, don't worry.
[326:03.60]There's not going to be a meltdown.
[326:15.64]Another t-shirt.
[326:20.61]This is not going to be a meltdown.
[326:22.27]Don't worry.
[326:23.75]I don't do those anymore.
[326:28.26]I watched a portion of Jump King VOD and I was like, I'm not doing this anymore.
[326:32.44]It's not happening anymore.
[326:46.82]It happened yesterday.
[326:48.28]No, it didn't.
[326:58.81]Where is this thing?
[327:01.05]There's the pink thing on the map.
[327:02.13]Where is it?
[327:05.55]Wait, what?
[327:09.13]Hey!
[327:09.75]I was just standing on there!
[327:20.59]Right here?
[327:27.01]Jesus, where is this thing?
[327:30.24]My Wiimote keeps...
[327:46.68]Okay, I'm... This is freaking me out.
[327:58.60]Let's pay the fee.
[327:59.78]Okay.
[328:14.14]Missing Nancy Drew right now.
[328:17.58]Don't worry, she'll be back when there's another technical problem on stream and I just go, what the hell am I going to do today?
[328:37.78]Nancy Drew will return.
[328:43.12]Pay the $300,000.
[328:44.26]Let's go rank 6.
[328:47.62]Let's-a go.
[328:58.91]God Hand?
[328:59.67]Play God Hand.
[329:01.37]I think I tried to play God Hand, and I... It was during one of those PlayStation 2 fuckface streams.
[329:09.71]Where... I...
[329:11.86]I've played so many old games.
[329:13.30]I probably have played 60 to 70 PlayStation 2 games on this stream, and like a hundred PlayStation 1 games or something.
[329:31.21]The beach.
[329:45.86]Alright, let's go ahead and... Go to the fridge.
[329:52.78]Go to the toilet.
[329:56.25]Save it up.
[329:58.15]And go do this mission.
[330:09.01]Hmm.
[330:09.93]Hmm.
[330:15.81]What's the objective of the game?
[330:16.84]To be the number one assassin.
[330:21.74]I'm currently rank seven.
[330:27.65]Trying to climb to rank six.
[330:30.31]Trying to be number one.
[330:45.86]I ignored the cat.
[330:47.24]What about the cat?
[330:49.20]Cat's fine.
[331:05.08]What about the cards?
[331:06.08]Well, look at the cards.
[331:06.78]Don't worry.
[331:07.12]We will.
[331:07.44]We will.
[331:07.76]We will.
[331:08.06]We will.
[331:08.36]I promise.
[331:08.74]I promise.
[331:09.06]I promise.
[331:09.38]I promise.
[331:09.68]I promise.
[331:10.00]I promise.
[331:10.54]I promise.
[331:10.94]I promise.
[331:11.26]To the beach.
[331:21.43]End of the stream, voice.
[331:23.19]Coming up after this.
[331:27.08]After this ranked mission, we're going to probably call it.
[331:30.18]I'm going to go eat some dinner.
[331:31.96]We'll pick back up tomorrow afternoon.
[331:34.20]And we'll probably finish the game tomorrow, too.
[331:40.51]I can't.
[331:40.85]It's an invisible wall.
[331:41.63]You can't.
[331:45.73]Let's go!
[331:48.91]Holly Summers.
[331:49.77]When did I put that shirt on?
[332:09.69]Your next opponent is here, on this beach.
[332:13.43]Ah, just up ahead.
[332:15.17]So I'm supposed to fight on the beach?
[332:17.40]That is one of the conditions.
[332:19.88]Why?
[332:21.00]That's for you to figure out.
[332:22.40]Feels good.
[332:25.66]What other hidden talents do you have, Travis?
[332:33.59]Go any higher and I will kill you myself!
[332:37.15]Not until you become number one.
[332:38.81]We have a deal, remember?
[332:40.31]So hurry up, and go get him!
[332:43.33]Yes, your highness.
[332:45.98]Are you prepared?
[332:55.24]Come on, come on!
[333:04.61]You're a joke!
[333:07.97]That was a nice little shimmy.
[333:41.29]Go to the end of the beach.
[333:46.43]Holy shit.
[333:50.55]That's from Nintendo 64 Goldeneye.
[333:52.93]That's the standard PP7.
[333:56.55]Shooting sound.
[333:58.73]Damn.
[334:03.45]Stop!
[334:33.93]I love that part.
[334:36.35]Ooh.
[334:49.64]Travis touchdown.
[334:53.60]Jerma, if you see this, look!
[334:54.92]Play something with Joel soon!
[334:56.84]I'm sure with Joel.
[335:04.35]Best thing to have right here, because I don't have to go anywhere.
[335:09.91]Just stay on the beach.
[335:12.60]Come on, give me somebody.
[335:13.74]Somebody else!
[335:24.66]Come on, spawn!
[335:26.00]Yeah!
[335:34.18]Yeah, I don't know.
[335:37.32]Maybe Joel and I will play... I don't know.
[335:42.64]Super Mario Brothers 3.
[335:43.76]Where I get blindfolded.
[335:52.36]And he puts plugs in his ears.
[335:55.01]And we both have to try to find a way to play the game!
[336:01.74]Wait, he would just be able to play.
[336:10.65]I love when you get the parry.
[336:16.59]And you get the kill instantly.
[336:17.67]Feels so good.
[336:19.59]Like that.
[336:20.67]Good.
[336:20.85]Come on, don't blow it.
[336:30.98]Spawn, spawn, spawn, spawn!
[336:39.30]How are you not dead?
[336:50.39]Get out.
[336:54.81]He gets the screen, but you get the controller.
[337:00.87]This is stupid.
[337:06.32]Where am I?
[337:14.62]That might work in games that are a little less complicated than... Not that Mario is complicated.
[337:19.74]No, it's not.
[337:20.26]That might actually work.
[337:30.45]Ooh!
[337:30.53]The best one! The best one! The best one! The best one!
[337:32.15]Best best best best!
[337:35.63]Come on.
[337:37.91]Please, still be in it.
[337:39.93]Ah! That sucks.
[337:50.93]That's annoying but it's okay.
[337:57.13]Thought I had it again.
[338:05.83]Almost there!
[338:07.69]Pop it in to say hello, love you guys!
[338:10.19]Hey, what's up?
[338:12.15]What's going on?
[338:15.75]Am I dead?
[338:27.70]What kind of gun is that?
[338:47.87]My head hurts after that.
[338:53.05]That just gave me a headache.
[338:54.41]Nice aim, idiot.
[338:55.81]Yeah, that was pretty good.
[338:58.21]Chest, chest, chest, chest!
[339:18.09]I can look at the cards, too.
[339:19.19]Yeah, you're right.
[339:19.93]You're right.
[339:21.85]There's chests over here, too.
[339:24.69]Hold on.
[339:24.93]Look at these.
[339:27.79]Oh, no.
[339:28.17]I can't go back.
[339:30.37]No.
[339:31.37]They're gone.
[339:32.07]Forever.
[339:33.85]Damn it.
[339:35.13]You should play Metal Wolf Chaos.
[339:42.57]I already have it.
[339:44.71]I beat that game.
[339:49.30]That was where the Gritty Grinner originated?
[339:51.78]Yeah.
[339:52.06]How many... Where are these people?
[339:54.12]I'm getting spawned on a thousand times.
[340:20.33]I'm not softlocked.
[340:21.41]This is it.
[340:22.23]Alright, that's it.
[340:28.38]Am I doing something wrong?
[340:36.74]I don't want to do this one anymore!
[340:51.45]Shake the Wiimote.
[340:52.11]Alright, is that it?
[340:53.65]That's it.
[340:54.41]Damn, that was a lot.
[340:55.59]You fucking dickhead.
[341:21.57]Ooh!
[341:26.23]Of course.
[341:30.17]Every time.
[341:31.73]Every time.
[341:32.11]I could have used that.
[341:32.77]I could have used that shit.
[341:41.17]I would have loved to have had that.
[341:46.05]Five minutes ago.
[341:56.32]I think it's mostly money.
[342:03.90]Yeah, it's money.
[342:06.04]Mostly money.
[342:09.77]The mini-map has... okay, the mini-map has him.
[342:28.72]More.
[342:30.06]Don.
[342:30.89]More.
[342:31.31]This level goes on forever.
[342:33.31]Yeah, this is a long one.
[342:34.51]Well, I guess to be fair, it's... It's just the beach.
[342:41.27]The other levels are in buildings, so I guess maybe it's the same length, but... It's a trading card, that's what I wanted.
[342:50.64]Get a money for your goods, man.
[342:52.54]Good night.
[342:58.34]I got it again.
[343:00.30]That's so stupid.
[343:04.66]After you swing for a finishing blow, swing again during the slow-mo motion part to cut through more people.
[343:37.21]I thought that was another foot grenade.
[343:44.85]Hello?
[343:45.75]Travis, hello?
[343:47.43]The secret beach is up ahead.
[343:49.59]Then it's ranking match time.
[343:52.03]Win, and you'll be number six.
[343:54.87]Lose, and your new home will be in the flaming tombs of hell.
[344:00.21]Everything okay?
[344:01.55]How's that sharp pain in your neck?
[344:03.85]Bladder in a bind?
[344:07.82]All those things actually apply to me.
[344:09.48]It's kinda true.
[344:10.48]Top 7 streamer.
[344:38.88]Full health.
[344:39.56]Save the game.
[344:40.50]Let's move.
[344:40.94]How do I get up?
[344:41.70]Oh, this way.
[345:15.03]No more mines, right?
[345:15.82]No.
[345:15.92]You have to go shit in the ocean to save.
[345:22.38]No, there's probably a port-a-potty right here.
[345:24.97]There is.
[345:25.49]It's not really a port-a-potty, is it?
[345:39.16]Travis, this is just common sense in Calgary.
[345:41.10]The king of suplexes.
[345:42.32]Remember now, Satan's ferris wheel.
[345:44.77]The belly-to-belly.
[345:45.95]Remembering old wrestling.
[345:50.65]The belly-to-belly.
[345:53.53]Yes!
[345:59.36]There are bathrooms and beaches.
[346:02.02]Hmm.
[346:13.13]Yeah, all over the place.
[346:14.45]No, I mean bathrooms that are at the beach.
[346:23.90]Stalls, toilets.
[346:27.10]Alright, Holly.
[346:33.48]You and me.
[346:35.98]Rank six.
[346:38.63]Go, go, go.
[346:55.44]Do you like fighting?
[346:56.79]Yep.
[346:59.81]Do you like killing?
[347:02.03]Yep.
[347:03.29]Live for it.
[347:05.21]Do you like fear?
[347:08.05]Can't say.
[347:09.17]Never felt it.
[347:11.35]Do you accept death?
[347:14.02]Death?
[347:15.26]Never crossed my mind.
[347:18.04]Death is the only truth.
[347:20.30]You are still a mere butt.
[347:23.78]That's not a good thing, you know.
[347:25.75]Seeking meaning in everything?
[347:27.93]Especially killing.
[347:29.43]That's a bad habit among smart little girls these days.
[347:33.05]Come closer and you will understand everything.
[347:39.11]I'm ready.
[347:40.21]Anywhere, anytime.
[347:42.32]Just your ordinary assassin.
[347:44.96]Such a disappointment.
[347:46.82]I have a lightsaber.
[347:47.76]No one else has a lightsaber.
[347:49.04]Normal assassins don't shoot the shit like this.
[347:51.93]They see their target and kill them.
[348:11.26]Let's see you get out of this predicament.
[348:14.08]Dead.
[348:14.52]Don't cry.
[348:15.80]You'll see.
[348:16.56]Uh-huh.
[348:21.53]What?
[348:22.73]A bird that will never blossom.
[348:25.79]A sad truth.
[348:27.53]Good night, my sweet seven.
[348:32.06]Let go of those.
[348:35.42]Oh, crap.
[348:44.63]I'm good.
[348:45.23]Nice trap.
[348:46.53]I like your style.
[348:47.79]Maybe I can steal a kiss before I steal your life.
[348:51.85]We'll see about that.
[348:55.15]That's not how grenades work.
[348:57.99]Oh, I just blocked it with my back.
[349:01.37]The missiles?
[349:03.05]Jesus Christ.
[349:03.93]Okay, hold on.
[349:10.54]God damn it.
[349:12.16]Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.
[349:26.06]Watch out for those stupid holes.
[349:29.26]What are you doing?
[349:40.11]She's... Oh, she covers... Get out of the way with the grenade!
[349:50.05]Come on, Demi!
[349:51.65]Oof.
[349:53.78]Shake!
[349:54.56]Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake!
[349:59.54]Kick her in the hole!
[350:05.33]Oh my fucking god!
[350:13.96]Kick her in the hole!
[350:15.14]Kick her in the hole!
[350:16.38]Kick her in the hole!
[350:20.92]Oh my god!
[350:31.65]Watch it.
[350:32.27]Don't!
[350:32.75]This fight... I don't like this fight.
[351:06.34]Oh my god, how did I get hit by that one?
[351:15.71]How did I get hit by that one?
[351:17.19]Get off!
[351:19.69]I've got tunnel vision.
[351:20.73]I'm not good at this one.
[351:22.07]I'm not good at this one.
[351:23.37]I'm not good at this one.
[351:24.05]I'm not good at this one.
[351:25.61]I'm not good at this one.
[351:27.59]Hug the wall.
[351:28.27]Hug the wall.
[351:49.05]What the fuck, I thought I... Into the ocean.
[351:58.99]How do I avoid this shit?
[352:00.13]Just by dodging the dodge?
[352:15.67]Stunlock in the corner.
[352:28.04]Belly to belly!
[352:32.06]That was really, really amazing damage.
[352:38.77]Oh fuck, I'm coming.
[352:39.51]Alright, I gotta get the health.
[352:50.05]Watch out.
[353:08.18]Stop doing that!
[353:09.02]That's not fair, I can't get in!
[353:11.17]Stop it!
[353:12.59]Don't go in a hole.
[353:40.16]Shit, I'm gonna fall.
[353:40.96]Don't fall in one.
[353:44.02]She's almost there.
[353:44.58]I gotta... I gotta... I have to use a battery.
[353:51.99]You piece of shit.
[353:53.51]Really?
[353:56.19]Ugh!
[353:56.33]She's on the rock?
[354:00.19]What does that mean?
[354:02.07]What is she doing?
[354:03.15]What the fuck is she doing?
[354:23.88]Not fair
[354:43.75]How did I not hit you?
[354:44.93]Oh my fucking god, I'm so stupid!
[354:49.81]Uh-oh.
[355:07.86]This is like a super move.
[355:08.68]I don't know what it does.
[355:10.24]She throws grenades?
[355:14.65]Where am I?
[355:15.05]Am I in the hole?
[355:24.16]Oh shit!
[355:29.38]Oh shit!
[355:30.06]Oh shit!
[355:30.85]My hands are sweating.
[355:39.15]Okay, I'm good.
[355:46.03]You shouldn't be able to do that move that many times.
[355:47.53]You shouldn't be able to do that move.
[355:52.65]Are you fucking kidding me?
[356:07.44]She's invincible during that move.
[356:09.50]She just did it like four times in a row.
[356:23.75]She's hit it four times in a row!
[356:25.79]She's got like 15 moves!
[356:40.66]I hate this boss.
[356:41.26]I hate this boss.
[356:56.33]I'm trying to hug the fucking walls, man.
[356:58.40]I just... I had... She was like two hits until she was fucking dead.
[357:05.82]What a pain in the ass.
[357:06.82]How did you get stunned out of that?
[357:13.89]I should have had that.
[357:26.82]I'm not messing around anymore Hug the wall, hug the wall, hug the wall
[358:06.67]Let's go.
[358:10.29]I ain't messing around.
[358:21.81]I'm getting in there hard.
[358:24.48]All the way in.
[358:26.50]Run, run, run.
[358:27.18]Just don't.
[358:28.22]No pressure, no pressure.
[358:29.88]All pressure.
[358:30.32]What do you mean no pressure?
[358:31.20]All pressure.
[358:33.15]I can still get full health.
[358:35.20]Now I know the mechanics.
[358:36.06]I know what you're doing.
[358:36.86]It's not even a big deal.
[358:37.94]You've got nothing on me now.
[358:54.53]Where are they?
[358:56.29]There's one, like, right here.
[358:57.07]There's one, like, right here.
[358:57.93]There's one right here.
[358:58.43]There's one, like, standing... It's just standing on... I knew it.
[359:03.36]What?
[359:34.20]No mercy.
[359:40.57]No mercy.
[359:47.03]Get out of here.
[359:58.84]Oh, that was fun.
[360:05.81]This is not mercy.
[360:07.98]You can't kill a woman.
[360:09.78]I did say no mercy, so... If you can't kill a woman, you are less than a thug.
[360:15.52]You will never make it to the top.
[360:19.72]That's okay.
[360:20.78]I seem to have a thing for stupid, pathetic men like you.
[360:24.33]I can accept defeat if it comes from your hand.
[360:28.19]I will let you in on a secret.
[360:30.61]Assassins must die when they lose.
[360:33.95]That's some clumpy mascara.
[360:35.31]That looks painful.
[360:37.87]Never forget me.
[360:40.09]Huh?
[360:41.73]Thank you.
[360:43.17]The moment you hesitated, I felt your embrace.
[360:49.08]Hold up.
[360:49.98]Academics like to fantasize too, you know.
[360:54.42]Wait!
[360:55.06]Number six!
[360:56.08]No!
[360:58.45]Wouldn't that... Wouldn't that kill me too?
[361:03.21]I'm standing two feet in front of you.
[361:06.03]Forgive me, number six.
[361:08.18]I never meant to shame you.
[361:14.57]Not a very smooth victory, Sir Travis, but a win is a win.
[361:19.37]That's all that matters.
[361:21.27]I hate to award you this, but you are now sixth in rank.
[361:26.67]What was her name?
[361:27.46]That's a special grenade.
[361:28.48]That is not important anymore.
[361:30.74]You're right, but I owe her at least that.
[361:35.18]Holly Summers, born in... No, just her name.
[361:44.88]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[361:47.70]What's the question marks for?
[361:48.66]What does that do?
[361:59.31]Uh, what?
[362:02.53]What am I doing?
[362:05.37]Am I, like, letting her out to rest at sea or something?
[362:07.85]I don't remember this part.
[362:35.37]Don't carry this lady's body around Obtain the US military secret, please give to Dr. Naomi Which I could this wasn't available I Couldn't do that before
[363:09.36]It was grayed out.
[363:18.63]That was not a respectful way to put somebody into a grave.
[363:23.37]Could have leaned down and laid in the sand.
[363:30.34]He just dropped her.
[363:33.00]Tossed her into the hole.
[363:34.32]Oh my goodness, that's bad.
[363:46.35]Six.
[363:49.48]So start at 11.
[363:51.82]We are at the pretty much exact halfway point of the game.
[363:57.34]Perfect timing.
[364:08.02]I do want to see the other weapon, though.
[364:12.31]I want to see the cards, and I want to see the new weapon.
[364:27.56]and I'll play with the cat yes hey this is Diane from these head videos um you're late returning one of our videos how many videos do I have um coffee and milk why would they still allow me to rent these have a nice day

[364:47.26]500?
[364:47.28]350?
[364:47.34]I think it goes up by 50,000 every time.

[365:48.28]Oh, well, I missed one.
[366:02.89]Is there a mask for a Killer7 guy?
[366:05.31]I never played Killer7.
[366:06.03]Get it.
[366:10.87]Get it.
[366:12.65]Get it.
[366:20.71]Good cat.
[366:21.23]Alright, let me save it here so we can have a place to start from tomorrow.
[366:28.76]I don't think I'm going to buy this sword right now.
[366:30.54]I just want to see it.
[366:31.08]I just want to look at it.
[366:32.74]Maybe I will buy it.
[366:45.23]Oh, right here.
[366:47.71]Let's take a look.
[366:49.69]It'll be too expensive anyways, yeah.
[366:56.66]Good job.
[366:59.60]Let's go see the beam katana upgrade.
[367:02.86]Mm-hmm.
[367:19.30]We gotta go through here.
[367:21.54]Pain in the ass.
[367:23.26]Pain in the ass.
[367:25.40]Eh.
[367:27.52]Termitivity is the worst emote on Twitch.
[367:30.08]I'm actually stuck.
[367:31.77]I can't drive this.
[367:37.77]Yeah, I mean, that's... I'm not gonna... What, am I gonna get rid of it?
[367:43.43]Why would I delete any emotes right now?
[367:46.11]When... I...
[367:52.00]It's doing its best.
[367:52.80]This is the most use this has ever gotten.
[368:00.98]Did somebody just do a giant F and then say fuck you in the middle?
[368:04.46]Scroll up, did you see that?
[368:07.54]One, two, three, four accounts, five accounts made a giant F and it says fuck you in the middle.
[368:14.05]Somebody gra- I wanna screenshot that.
[368:15.91]That's insane.
[368:21.26]Was that intentional?
[368:22.12]Hey, don't lay a single finger on anything.
[368:31.16]Where the hell did you get this?
[368:32.28]I swear you can get your hands on almost anything these days.
[368:35.18]It scares me to think a thing like this is out in the world.
[368:37.31]Let's see what I can do.
[368:38.59]Oh, it's not available yet.
[368:48.89]You old talker.
[368:54.23]Did you get it?
[368:54.81]Let's see.
[369:00.23]Fuck you.
[369:01.15]With a big F. That's insane.
[369:03.75]That's awesome.
[369:09.55]Alright, that's gonna wrap it up for tonight.
[369:11.93]That's a perfect clean six hours.
[369:15.31]Plus, that gives us time to do probably like six to seven hours tomorrow to finish the game.
[369:21.53]And then, after that is the New Year's Eve stream.
[369:26.45]I'll save it again.
[369:27.69]I just did.
[369:30.73]I just did right before.
[369:31.53]Oh, well, you want me to save because I gave the... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[369:35.54]I'll do it again.
[369:41.40]What time is the New Year's stream going to start?
[369:42.76]6 p.m.
[369:44.18]Pacific is the New Year's Eve stream.
[369:46.80]Starting at 9 Eastern.
[369:48.78]It's to make sure that we can do all the festivities and count down the ball drop Eastern time.
[370:07.83]And then for Pacific time, I'm going to spend it with Kim.
[370:10.93]I did not spend New Year's Eve with Kim last year.
[370:15.30]So, her and I are going to hang out.
[370:23.30]I'm stuck again.
[370:25.34]I'm trying to back up, and it won't let me.
[370:27.08]I'm right in front of a cop, too.
[370:36.99]Whatever, I'm just walking.
[370:45.26]Yeah, we'll continue No More Heroes tomorrow.
[370:46.92]We will beat it tomorrow.
[370:52.42]And then after New Year's, depending on how into this I am, how into No More Heroes, we might just do the second one right after.
[371:00.74]And just... Well, maybe we'll do it the week after?
[371:03.14]Maybe next... Do something else for a few streams?
[371:05.76]I don't know.
[371:09.12]But I do wanna play the second one.
[371:10.22]Alright, save it here.
[371:21.65]Rhythm Heaven, Rhythm Heaven, Rhythm Heaven.
[371:25.45]I will, I will.
[371:26.77]I will play Rhythm Heaven, I swear.
[371:35.29]Alright.
[371:36.33]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[371:37.35]If you're sticking around, we're going to do the bits and the subs and everything.
[371:42.85]Thanks again for watching.
[371:44.86]Maybe we'll see you tomorrow.
[371:47.68]That will conclude part one of No More Heroes Wii Edition in quotes.
[371:53.22]This music's pretty good, but... You know?
[372:04.51]Pretty good.
[372:13.49]Pretty good.
[372:16.51]He doesn't, he doesn't hate, what do you mean, he hates the cat?
[372:18.79]What do you mean he hates the cat?
[372:27.88]That's not true.
[372:33.66]Let's get the, fine, I'll get this music on.
[372:35.34]I played with the cat every time.
[372:41.76]I played with the cat every time.
[372:47.44]let's go let's do it let's do the bits bits bits bits bits we had a lot of subs came in today Jerma sucks gave a shitload Jerma sucks gave 20 community subs right at the very beginning of the stream too so thank you for that clown connoisseur gave 500 bits hey Jerma thank you for the content thank you for the five dolls clown connoisseur

[373:40.98]Thank you.
[373:41.84]Thanks a lot, guys.
[373:45.30]Gnarly gave $2.50 here.
[373:48.13]Feel like you just streamed this game as an excuse to put Travis in the next Rumble.
[373:51.46]And honestly, I'm all for it.
[373:55.66]He wouldn't be a very hard character to make.
[373:58.25]Just brown jacket, glasses, and that hair.
[374:02.55]It'd be a pretty easy character to make.
[374:09.90]When is the next rumble?
[374:10.82]We talked about the next rumble yesterday at the end of the stream.
[374:15.96]And I don't really have any details for it.
[374:17.66]But the next rumble is going to be a charity rumble.
[374:22.62]So I'll give more details on that when I have them.
[374:31.79]Fruit charity.
[374:32.59]Well, it won't be live action.
[374:33.53]It'll be in a game.
[374:36.29]But thank you, Gnarly.
[374:36.93]Thank you, SadVega for the 250.
[374:38.31]Man, Nancy Drew finally got barely interesting.
[374:41.59]I'm really glad you hung with it.
[374:42.76]It's at least becoming a wannabe God Hand poser game now.
[374:47.98]Are you implying that No More Heroes is a poser God Hand poser game?
[375:00.65]It's not.
[375:01.75]There are no lightsabers in God Hand.
[375:06.94]Hey, Bacchus, thanks for the 500 bits.
[375:08.62]I'm so glad you love this game, too.
[375:09.86]It's my favorite game on the Wii.
[375:11.12]It's probably one of the best games to come out on the Wii.
[375:12.77]I don't even have the Wiimote in my hand, and I'm still moving my arms around like an idiot.
[375:23.85]Yeah, it's one of the best games to come out on the platform, both 1 and 2.
[375:27.53]Thank you, Bacchus, though.

[375:55.30]Thank you, Zugli, for the 1,000 bits.
[375:57.23]Appreciate it.
[376:01.89]Gooberry Juice.
[376:02.65]Thanks for the 500 bits, Gooberry.
[376:04.69]This is definitely one of my favorite games and I'm so happy you're playing it.
[376:07.51]But I guess I wasn't prepared for how much the Drew crew would hate it because of the shame I now feel I'm going to go home, watch anime, take a piss, and commit seppuku with a beam sword.
[376:31.46]Well,
[376:34.40]Thank you for the 500 bits, Goo Berry Juice.
[376:36.88]Drew Crew approved.
[376:38.48]We can't have two fighting communities.
[376:41.59]There can't be Drew Crew versus everybody else.
[376:52.20]The Drew Crew didn't even hate this.
[376:54.20]Yes, there can be.
[376:55.78]There will be.
[377:00.70]Drew Crew versus Team Travis.

[378:09.66]I actually was sitting there.
[378:11.12]I don't even need the menu.
[378:12.88]Okay.
[378:13.58]Don't even need the menu.
[378:15.34]I know what I am going to order.

[378:24.93]The blue cheeseburger.

[378:31.45]We ran out of meat.
[378:32.51]We don't have any meat.
[378:33.49]It's all gone.
[378:34.03]Because when it's gone, it's gone.
[378:36.80]Their meat is fucking phenomenal.
[378:40.00]And they ran out.
[378:40.90]And they were like, we don't have any more.

[379:13.00]Thank you.
[379:15.52]Noodle is bad at gaming thanks to the 500 bits.
[379:18.42]Jerma, do you celebrate Honda days?
[379:21.48]Or Toyota-thon?
[379:27.66]Is that when the cars are... They just try to sell a shitload of cars in a row?
[379:35.86]I don't even know what that is.
[379:36.64]It's just like there's a... You can... It's better... I don't know what that means.
[379:40.41]I think that's just like... It's just... No, I don't celebrate either one of those.

[380:15.20]Thanks, everybody.
[380:17.48]All the subs, every single one of you, every single sub, whether you got it because somebody gave it to you and you were just here and you got it, or you've been subbed for five years, or...
[380:32.34]You don't have a sub.
[380:33.48]Thanks for fucking being here.
[380:36.62]But seriously, there's a lot of subs now, a lot of people.
[380:39.40]Thank you so much for your fucking support.
[380:42.72]You just run, you run this channel.
[380:45.50]Well, you don't run it, but like you're, you're the blood, you're blood.
[380:50.04]You're my blood.
[380:51.90]You guys are all just moving around in my body, like bringing oxygen to my various organs for the channel.

[381:25.04]Thank you very nice for the 250.
[381:26.92]Please, please do another... Please, please do another stream of Heroes of Might and Magic 3.
[381:32.18]I really enjoyed fanboying with you over how good the game is.
[381:35.12]Particularly since you seemed like you were genuinely having fun with it.
[381:41.43]I would probably want to make a custom scenario if I ever did it again.
[381:46.29]It'd be nice to do that and actually make a...
[381:49.99]an adventure that happens that is played out on stream.
[381:53.89]That'd be more fun, I think.
[381:57.11]But yeah, I mean, I'm terrible at that game, but I do love it.
[382:04.81]Miss Lily T, thanks for the $2.55.
[382:06.63]$2.55.
[382:07.13]It's good to see you playing games that you enjoy.
[382:10.81]I mean, I love No More Heroes.
[382:16.81]I do enjoy it very much, though.
[382:20.00]Hill Sint, or Hills NT, thanks for the 500 bits.
[382:24.93]They say Team Travis.
[382:27.79]Thanks for the five dollars.
[382:31.71]Team Travis.
[382:32.76]I mean, I don't want to tear the community apart here.
[382:37.64]You're going to get Team Travis.
[382:38.98]You're going to get Drew Crew.
[382:41.78]Different days are different things.

[382:55.86]This is my proudest accomplishment.
[383:00.36]Oh, you were in there!
[383:01.18]You were part of that!
[383:03.32]You were part of that!
[383:05.88]I still... I can't fucking believe it.
[383:08.96]I have to show this on stream for people in the VOD to really understand what the hell is going on here.
[383:18.23]Because I'm sure people are going to be like, what's he talking about?
[383:21.12]Look at this.
[383:22.08]This is one, two, three, four, five.
[383:24.14]I think there was even a sixth person.
[383:26.92]But this is five different people.
[383:29.26]All in the middle of spam, by the way.
[383:35.10]So people were just spamming the jermaTV emote.
[383:38.84]And we got a one in a million.
[383:46.76]A fuck you, spelling out the F. I mean, the one... The person under the fuck you... Is the only... But that still don't matter.
[384:12.79]That could be a thick line.
[384:19.45]And that's it, guys.
[384:20.23]I'll see you tomorrow.
[384:21.99]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[384:23.47]We had... Right now, actually, five more subs just came in from Wesker Run.
[384:29.79]Thank you, Wesker Run.
[384:32.87]Right at the very end.
[384:35.41]Bunch of love to you.
[384:36.93]And congratulations to those of you that got the sub.
[384:48.47]See you tomorrow.
[384:52.10]What is this?
[384:54.08]I've already seen this image.
[384:55.06]The mega jump, whatever this is.
[384:57.04]I've seen this before.
[384:59.00]See you tomorrow.
[385:03.55]Have a good rest of your night.
