[ve:60.16.100]

[00:04.28]Hey, what's up?
[00:05.64]How are you?
[00:07.31]A little early.
[00:07.87]It's okay.
[00:13.27]We're early.
[00:17.53]Yeah, we're supposed to start tomorrow at like 4.
[00:20.93]We're a little early.
[00:22.03]I figured I'd start at least a couple hours early.
[00:24.11]Give me a minute.
[00:28.51]I don't know where my phone is.
[00:32.61]Be right back.
[01:07.61]Okay.
[01:09.37]I'll send a tweet out real quick.
[01:12.05]And we can get started.
[01:16.35]What about... Have you seen our place?
[01:17.95]I have.
[01:18.19]I'm very aware of the ongoings.
[01:22.09]Various battles going on in our place.
[01:25.57]Make this really clear.
[01:27.28]The Jermamite army is incredibly, incredibly strong.
[01:30.68]I'm observing.
[01:32.76]I'm observing.
[01:34.88]And I'm calculating.
[01:40.74]I have no commands for you.
[01:44.42]We're observing.
[01:47.64]Let's see what happens.
[01:55.27]Who gave this lunatic an army?
[01:59.83]I'm telling you right now, I've got a strong community.
[02:12.42]What are the orders?
[02:13.18]I don't have orders for you.
[02:15.84]Your orders are to observe, calculate, compassionate, empathize, strike when necessary.
[02:28.50]Those are your orders.
[02:36.77]Give us something.
[02:39.19]I am observing.
[02:41.03]I have nowhere to strike.
[02:42.21]That's the thing, right?
[02:44.19]Oh, Jerva!
[02:45.37]Where are we striking?
[02:49.01]I don't have... There are no targets for me here.
[02:59.24]Where are we landing?
[03:00.78]You need to defend the sus face.
[03:04.93]Well... I'm aware of his existence.
[03:08.97]I'm aware.
[03:10.31]I'm very aware.
[03:13.01]Worst general ever.
[03:14.72]General, what are your orders?
[03:17.14]I'm very aware, and I want you to be compassionate, and I want you to be aware.
[03:22.24]Sir, they're flanking us.
[03:23.74]Just be aware of it.
[03:24.32]I want you to be aware of it, and just keep your eye on it.
[03:28.05]What a bad general.
[03:29.17]I don't have anything for you yet, okay?
[03:31.49]I am actually trying to see how this plays out.
[03:36.06]I don't want to make an alliance with somebody.
[03:37.98]And then, here's the thing about the R-Play stuff.
[03:41.28]So, if I make an alliance with somebody, that person has a battle or a war going on with somebody else that now hates me, that wants to get rid of my shit, and then I come forward and I go, let's go after that fucking person.
[03:54.41]I break that alliance that I have with that person, that person then has two more alliances, then those people are mad at me, and then somebody from the top right corner
[04:05.22]starts posting and saying, hey, Jermamites, we need you in top right corner to defend the Shovel Knight.
[04:10.70]It's like, dude, I broke like five alliances and I have like two wars going on down here.
[04:16.47]I don't know.
[04:18.11]It's hard to get involved.
[04:19.75]But if we need to.
[04:20.81]Oh, we will if we need to.
[04:23.99]We will.
[04:28.55]What is he talking about?
[04:29.59]Okay.
[04:30.59]I will show you.
[04:32.83]In just a second.
[04:35.22]What is it?
[04:36.38]These are just like the delusions of some random guy.
[04:39.41]No.
[04:40.41]Okay.
[04:40.99]Listen to me.
[04:41.63]I didn't even tweet the stream.
[04:42.64]Just hold on.
[04:43.72]Give me a sec.
[05:41.33]Okay, I'm back.
[05:43.03]So, yeah, let me explain what this is.
[05:44.99]This is easy for me to do this.
[05:46.38]I'll just show you.
[05:47.20]Let me come back over here.
[05:51.82]Hi, how are you?
[05:53.58]Okay, so, this is our slash place.
[05:58.25]I've been, I was made aware of this.
[06:01.71]Every single pixel here, every single one, is placed by an individual user.
[06:09.09]So, for instance, like pirates, right?
[06:10.97]Like somebody, one person had to click that square right there.
[06:17.04]It is huge.
[06:18.62]I believe it's every five to ten minutes.
[06:21.30]Your cooldown refreshes.
[06:23.74]There's a dick on the screen.
[06:27.12]Okay, whatever.
[06:28.12]What do you want me to do about it?
[06:30.13]Oh, no.
[06:30.39]Okay, refresh in five to ten minutes and show me where the Where's Waldo dick is.
[06:35.67]Because that's just going to happen for the rest of the time this is here.
[06:39.43]So, the craziest part about this is... Okay, we've got... There's a little... I think that's supposed to be me.
[06:47.72]I think that's me.
[06:49.58]I've been told it's me.
[06:50.76]I don't know.
[06:51.36]I kind of don't want it to be.
[06:53.12]But it is.
[06:54.94]I have no stake in this.
[06:56.74]I have no idea what happened.
[06:58.02]I didn't tell anybody to do this.
[07:01.99]But that is, I guess, where you guys have collected yourselves, I guess.
[07:07.63]But, let me tell you.
[07:11.98]There are no alliances here.
[07:14.64]If the Jermamites need to be called in, maybe.
[07:19.41]It depends.
[07:21.17]I am totally okay with this being right here.
[07:24.79]We don't need to go anywhere else.
[07:25.99]We don't need to do anything else.
[07:27.67]I'm just observing.
[07:29.79]Check the chessboard.
[07:35.29]Where's the chessboard?
[07:41.35]Chessboard?
[07:46.55]Right side.
[07:53.02]Jesus Christ.
[07:54.72]Okay, chessboard.
[08:06.46]Left.
[08:06.88]Why'd you say right?
[08:08.08]Everyone just started saying right.
[08:10.07]Chessboard.
[08:13.48]Down near the Sus face?
[08:18.68]Left in the middle.
[08:23.12]Okay, in relation to Star Wars, where is it?
[08:26.86]Directly above Sus.
[08:30.96]Oh, right here?
[08:31.46]Oh, okay.
[08:35.22]Okay.
[08:36.80]Alright, this is cool.
[08:38.54]I'm okay with that, right?
[08:40.98]We can just concentrate in this little spot.
[08:44.78]I don't... I don't need more than one cube, okay?
[08:49.28]Let me tell you.
[08:51.74]Very cleanly.
[08:54.10]We don't need much.
[08:55.66]We need a square this big.
[09:00.72]If you attack, the Jermamites are ready.
[09:05.24]And they always will be.
[09:05.94]And they're some of the strongest, most...
[09:11.77]I said vile.
[09:13.67]The most vile.
[09:15.25]They are very strong and they know how to draw.
[09:19.90]This community is incredibly artistic.
[09:23.16]Like you guys could, the amount of art, the amount of creativity that I see here.
[09:27.58]Trust me when I say, all we need is a little cube and that's it.
[09:36.02]There are no allegiances.
[09:36.86]There are no alliances.
[09:39.08]Nothing.
[09:42.06]Everybody is, we have a creative community here.
[09:45.16]So I, what I'm not going to do is I'm not going to, well, I'm not going to say this because I know the second I say this, it's going to be like, there it goes, right?
[09:53.13]Let's observe.
[09:55.03]I'll look back in a little bit and see what it looks like.
[09:58.17]We're incredibly uncoordinated, but strong.
[10:10.20]You're a community of incredibly intelligent doctors, scientists, and... He's a long, and I gotta cut them.
[10:17.90]Like, with it, I just saw it over here.
[10:20.03]Okay, I gotta fucking turn this preview off.
[10:22.41]I distract myself with my own preview.
[10:24.39]I'm reading what you guys are saying, and then I go, there's a guy right there, and I look at it.
[10:27.27]I fucking hate it.
[10:27.83]I don't want to look at this.
[10:28.91]I'm gonna move the facecam to the other side of the screen.
[10:36.72]Oh, yeah, I know there are other streamers that are doing this.
[10:40.00]I've been watching some of them, and it's been fucking crazy.
[10:42.24]It's been actually pretty entertaining, if I'm honest.
[10:47.56]Change your talismans.
[10:48.60]Thank you.
[10:49.14]Now, let's get to the real thing here.
[10:52.31]I... Yes, I'm supposed to stream tomorrow.
[10:54.69]But, I kind of...
[10:58.58]I just, I wanted to do it, and people were saying some stuff to me, and I'm going to take it to heart now.
[11:04.79]They said, Jerma, these last few encounters are ridiculous.
[11:09.41]They're hard, they're frustrating, they make people angry, and you need to do whatever means necessary to try to kill them.
[11:16.23]So I know that there are a few spells that I don't have that people keep telling me about, and I want to go get those spells and just see what they do.
[11:26.45]Yeah, it's r slash place.
[11:27.85]It's really, look, even if we're not gonna, you know, participate all that much.
[11:31.99]I mean, I know a lot of you guys already are.
[11:33.13]It's just really cool.
[11:34.49]They do it every, what, every year?
[11:35.63]Every few years?
[11:39.01]It's really cool.
[11:39.87]It's been awesome to see just the communities kind of, even across the world, watching all these different communities like kind of, in a fun way, right?
[11:50.68]Kind of battle for this kind of land and like territory almost.
[11:55.42]It's like, alright, I've seen people have treaties.
[11:57.64]Alright, we'll give up a quarter of this part of our territory here, but we want an alliance.
[12:04.00]It's like everyone's playing Risk.
[12:07.50]It's a game of Risk with like 60 million people.
[12:13.14]You're a beta male chapstick user.
[12:16.71]No, I'm older, and my lips are dry.
[12:18.63]That's it.
[12:23.43]Yeah, it's just, they're playing, everyone's playing, like, Risk or, like, Crusader Kings or something, right?
[12:31.14]You're speaking with Elden Ring vocabulary.
[12:36.89]What is he talking about?
[12:37.65]It's his ARP!
[12:38.57]Whatever, you know what I'm doing.
[12:40.63]So, I'm at the end of the game, so this is literally the finale.
[12:45.03]But I'm not going to go through this door.
[12:46.69]I want to go get the spell, because everyone was talking about there's a spell, there's two of them, three of them.
[12:52.61]I want the crazy spells, and I want to do the crazy shit.
[12:56.92]Because what opportunity am I going to have after this?
[12:59.80]So, I know people said go get the comet, comet, comet, comet, comet, right?
[13:03.76]Where is it?
[13:04.92]Do I know where it is?
[13:08.99]You should get the spell that turns you into a toaster.
[13:11.21]That would be fucking Monka LOL.
[13:19.47]Go to the Volcano Manor.
[13:20.31]Okay.
[13:21.57]That's stop number one.
[13:24.28]Volcano Manor.
[13:30.28]You should do a bong rip.
[13:35.23]Go through the Windham Ruins in Atlas Plateau.
[13:43.32]Dude, I didn't do like anything in this bottom part of Atlas Plateau.
[13:47.55]Do I have it?
[13:49.53]Or is it down here somewhere?
[13:55.08]Where's this move?
[13:56.46]Right here?
[14:00.40]After Caelid, you just started zooming.
[14:03.28]By the tree.
[14:04.92]Like up here?
[14:10.22]Over here somewhere, maybe?
[14:11.57]Here?
[14:13.53]You're missing a lot of bonfires.
[14:14.97]I only have, like, three in this whole entire zone.
[14:19.45]There's a dungeon along the wall.
[14:20.75]Like here?
[14:24.34]Or here?
[14:24.60]I don't think I even walked- I don't think I even went over here.
[14:29.76]Go to the cringe village.
[14:30.60]That mine you highlighted earlier.
[14:35.48]So, like, over here.
[14:37.90]Like, in this area.
[14:39.30]If I go over here, am I gonna be, like, in the right spot?
[14:43.19]Is that correct?
[14:47.97]South of Volcano Manor.
[14:49.45]So, like, down here.
[14:52.81]Should I go from Abandoned Coffin this way?
[14:57.14]I guess I could just look this up, right?
[14:58.30]Do I really...
[15:00.47]I can just look it up.
[15:04.52]Well, we'll start here.
[15:05.12]I'm just going to look it up.
[15:10.08]What's the spell called?
[15:15.28]Comet.
[15:20.53]Comet Azur.
[15:21.45]Okay.
[15:26.81]Comet Azur.
[15:28.92]Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[15:29.92]Where to find it?
[15:30.44]Uh, it's in the Hermit Village in Mount Gelmer.
[15:34.14]Okay, so where's that?
[15:41.87]It looks like... Yeah, so it's right... This is actually probably not a bad place to be.
[15:47.55]It's actually literally right below that, the tree there.
[15:51.53]I gotta go, like, to there.
[15:53.28]How do I get over there?
[15:57.70]It's, like, here.
[16:00.64]Probably from this grave here.
[16:01.94]It's like right here.
[16:11.11]Not even close.
[16:11.77]What are you talking?
[16:12.19]Yes, it is.
[16:12.51]It's right there.
[16:14.67]I'm going to go from... Should I just go from the... Should I walk this way or should I walk down from here?
[16:23.45]It's the village on the map.
[16:25.87]Right here.
[16:26.13]Alright, I'm going to try to find my way over there.
[16:29.05]Starting from... I have to go this way?
[16:33.23]I'm just going to go from here.
[16:43.41]What did you see?
[16:43.93]Dance?
[16:45.79]Oh, that's alright.
[16:49.96]Wait, wrong one.
[16:50.64]Go from the...
[16:58.40]This actually... Because this is probably down.
[17:03.76]Can I get there from here?
[17:07.37]There's a Discord for the R slash place.
[17:09.71]Yeah, you guys can do whatever you want.
[17:10.97]I'm not sending you anywhere.
[17:12.71]Alright?
[17:13.49]I'm ready.
[17:15.11]But I ain't... I got nowhere for you to go.
[17:16.49]I've never played Genshin Impact.
[17:28.65]Um, I played it a little bit when it first came out.
[17:32.19]I put like $6,000 or $7,000 into it.
[17:35.43]And then I was like, ah, I'm not really into it.
[17:48.24]And then I uninstalled it, and I broke the iPad over my knee.
[17:51.38]That's what happened.
[17:51.90]Fuck, I forgot.
[17:52.36]That was so long ago, though.
[17:53.87]That was like a few months ago.
[17:58.92]Okay, can I get there from here?
[18:01.20]Probably.
[18:01.64]Or is it too low?
[18:08.49]Is it higher up or is it lower?
[18:13.31]Shit, it's right there.
[18:15.49]It's literally right there.
[18:17.07]The way you guys are telling me to go.
[18:18.45]Fuck.
[18:20.72]Is there a jump over here?
[18:21.78]Alright, I'm gonna have to go from... Here?
[18:30.06]And then go left?
[18:41.26]Yeah, what I'm doing right now is I'm trying- I'm getting the- I'm going to get the best spell in the game, apparently.
[18:47.49]Wrong way.
[18:49.29]This is apparently the best sorcery in the whole game.
[18:52.07]From what I've been told, it just melts people.
[18:55.49]It's ridiculous.
[18:57.07]Apparently.
[19:02.96]Okay.
[19:04.50]Now, is there a way I can go around?
[19:06.14]What is attacking me?
[19:08.94]Oh, shit.
[19:09.40]I didn't even do Atlas Plateau.
[19:13.05]I just, like, snoozed through this place.
[19:15.41]I didn't do any of this?
[19:16.33]Sorry.
[19:19.97]Be strong.
[19:20.31]I'll do it.
[19:24.63]Okay.
[19:26.69]Is this whole area...
[19:32.32]Perfumer is ruined.
[19:34.56]I mean, let's see what's here.
[19:35.22]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[19:45.80]I'm facing the wrong way.
[19:56.98]I'm just trying to get a spell here.
[20:03.34]Do you stink?
[20:04.54]From here, where do I go?
[20:24.82]Oh, a chest.
[20:27.74]Oh, nice!
[20:30.52]Preferring his cookbook?
[20:33.04]Holy shit!
[20:33.66]Is there a place to go down?
[20:46.97]Cave moss?
[20:48.11]Cool, okay.
[20:49.01]There's probably a way to go down.
[20:50.65]Maybe that's it.
[20:59.50]Fume bottle.
[21:00.48]Those are like the flasks.
[21:01.69]I haven't used them the whole game.
[21:06.05]Anywhere to go down?
[21:07.13]Like a dungeon or something?
[21:11.74]Or another... What's that?
[21:16.00]Yep.
[21:17.36]Very nice.
[21:30.37]Perfumer's Talisman.
[21:33.71]The perfume bottle thing, I don't... Raises potency of perfume items.
[21:39.21]Okay.
[21:42.05]I... I don't know.
[21:43.21]This is a lot.
[21:43.78]Me strong, I'll take care of it.
[21:46.06]Why do your lips look so greasy?
[21:47.72]Did you eat KFC recently?
[21:53.88]Oh, man.
[21:54.24]I love that.
[21:55.10]I love that.
[21:55.50]Extra crispy combo.
[21:57.70]Oh.
[22:13.73]God, I fucking love KFC more than anything.
[22:20.53]After you eat KFC, you can smell it on your face for like at least an hour, even if you wipe your mouth and like wash your face and stuff.
[22:27.34]It's disgusting, by the way.
[22:28.98]It is.
[22:29.18]Okay, I think I got everything here.
[22:37.30]Let's keep going.
[22:41.87]I need to go over this way.
[22:42.94]I actually don't want to, like, get, like, zits on my, like, chin.
[22:46.62]Alright, we're going to four.
[22:49.40]How can I get to four?
[22:50.42]Around here?
[22:50.86]No.
[22:55.69]Around here.
[23:05.37]Shit.
[23:08.68]How do I get over there?
[23:20.91]This guy's pretty greasy.
[23:21.73]I think I have to go from the lava place, yeah.
[23:25.13]Unless, is there a... Can I go through here?
[23:29.35]Is there like a dungeon or something?
[23:32.03]There's definitely something here.
[23:47.36]Here we go.
[23:49.51]Alright, let's go.
[23:50.83]Yep.
[23:55.20]Sage's Cave.
[23:56.24]I don't have a... You know the move.
[24:04.64]KFC Manor.
[24:16.69]There it is.
[24:17.09]Stoplight.
[24:23.59]Yeah, so there's this move.
[24:25.37]There's a spell.
[24:27.23]There's a fake wall.
[24:30.65]So I know that there are a few more spells.
[24:32.55]And I need your help.
[24:35.29]This is the backseat stream.
[24:37.27]This is the stream where... It's a late night stream.
[24:40.39]And we're trying to get to the end.
[24:41.91]Trying to get as powerful as we can.
[24:44.15]I'm ready to be backseated.
[24:52.12]Alright, I can go this way.
[24:53.42]Wait, what about down here?
[24:58.90]Every stream so far has been a backseat stream.
[25:01.36]Yeah.
[25:01.62]Alright, can't make that.
[25:08.04]There's two bosses in this dungeon?
[25:10.82]Really?
[25:17.40]Pretty cool.
[25:23.20]There's a very useful chest piece here.
[25:26.96]Okay.
[25:27.14]Yeah, because I... Here, alright.
[25:31.03]Everyone tells me about this... Laser beam move.
[25:35.13]I know it exists.
[25:37.41]They say, dude, just go get the laser beam.
[25:39.41]Please, for the love of God, just go get the laser beam.
[25:41.16]It's cool.
[25:42.84]And I'm like, alright.
[25:44.62]So that's... I want to use the laser beam on Millennium.
[25:47.84]Understand?
[25:49.56]Understand?
[25:51.35]And if it is what I think it's going to do, I have an idea.
[25:55.07]Can I actually not make that?
[25:58.89]Whatever, I'm scared.
[26:03.72]It's two chests?
[26:14.59]Lost Ashes of War?
[26:19.06]Rejuvenating boluses.
[26:20.44]It sucks.
[26:20.94]It's cheese.
[26:24.14]That's fine.
[26:25.79]I know that there's at least three spells that I... And plus, I want to... I've gone the whole game without using any of the ridiculous... Like, dump 80 points into sorcery and just do the beam at every boss.
[26:38.59]I haven't done that.
[26:39.31]And you know I haven't.
[26:42.39]I haven't done that.
[26:45.91]So if there's one opportunity I'm going to take...
[26:48.79]To do that move to someone.
[26:50.83]It's going to be Millenia.
[26:54.73]I'm going to hold on to it.
[26:56.37]And I'm going to just... I'm going to keep it in the back pocket.
[26:59.25]Just a wall.
[27:05.25]Where?
[27:06.00]Back here?
[27:14.16]There.
[27:17.26]Hello.
[27:17.54]Oh my god, there's a lot of you in this room.
[27:20.19]This will be good for these guys because it'll hit them when they're on the ground.
[27:31.05]Oh my god, I can see.
[27:47.86]Come on, Starlight Kim, do it already.
[27:50.14]Bandit's Curve Sword.
[27:51.32]I don't even need to look at it.
[27:52.62]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[27:57.92]This feels, um... This feels like Mario Party.
[28:01.21]Like, I feel like if I... Like, we're all gonna take a turn.
[28:03.97]And it's gonna blow up in our face.
[28:05.39]Okay.
[28:16.05]Black Hood.
[28:20.40]Candle Tree Wooden Shield.
[28:22.80]And Butterfly.
[28:29.89]That's it?
[28:31.82]What is the Candle Tree Wooden Shield?
[28:42.09]Light for its size, easy to handle.
[28:44.09]Thought to represent a surrepetitious prophecy of cardinal sin.
[28:48.72]The lit candle tree design was forbidden.
[28:51.42]Lit candle tree?
[28:53.98]A burning Earth tree?
[29:05.85]How did you just pronounce that?
[29:06.97]I don't know.
[29:07.37]I just guessed.
[29:07.87]Looks like I got it right.
[29:16.72]Hey, chat.
[29:16.98]Did you tell Jerm about the thing?
[29:18.68]I think they did.
[29:20.84]The R place.
[29:21.85]Are you aware?
[29:25.65]I have no orders.
[29:27.93]There are no orders for you.
[29:28.77]This guy still doesn't have a lantern.
[29:38.26]Nope.
[29:41.36]This is lantern and 8%.
[29:44.69]No Lantern, 90%.
[29:55.78]Star and Sword key.
[29:58.48]Very cool.
[30:02.90]You beat Godfrey with no Lantern.
[30:04.72]Yeah.
[30:08.82]And would again, my lord.
[30:22.28]Raptor Talons?
[30:23.29]What is that?
[30:23.85]Why are there so many chests everywhere?
[30:30.01]This is the most chests that I've ever been in a dungeon.
[30:33.77]Baseline of Deck Scaling Sea.
[30:37.80]Claw?
[30:38.36]What is it?
[30:39.40]Claw comprised of two sharp, thin blades.
[30:42.38]Builded by the Assassins of Ravenmount.
[30:47.62]To imitate the Deathbirds.
[30:51.31]What is this?
[30:54.12]That's really good for PvP.
[30:55.44]Hmm.
[30:59.15]Golden Great Arrow.
[31:00.09]Why are there so many chests here?
[31:02.87]Just get the shit out of me.
[31:17.23]Okay.
[31:18.43]Uh... Go here?
[31:24.84]There's so much stuff.
[31:31.41]Skeletal mask.
[31:33.63]And raptor's black feathers.
[31:35.17]Whoa.
[31:36.47]Where's the mask?
[31:41.37]Skeletal mask.
[31:47.97]Where is it?
[31:53.70]A skeleton mask that tightly grips the face worn by the assassins of Ravenmount.
[31:59.10]This ritual implement relentlessly digs into the wearer's face, preserving one's human instincts while dressed in imitation of the Deathbirds.
[32:11.04]That's interesting.
[32:12.80]What is this?
[32:23.85]I have so much stuff.
[32:24.69]We have raptors, black feathers.
[32:26.54]Focus and vitality is really high.
[32:31.02]Transforming into ritual or transforming into a Deathbird, if only by imitation.
[32:36.14]Strengthens jump attacks.
[32:39.04]That's kind of cool.
[32:42.64]That's really cool.
[32:47.53]That's Bloodborne armor.
[32:48.51]It does kind of look like Bloodborne armor.
[32:49.81]You're right.
[32:56.95]Good boss.
[32:59.37]I'm so unbelievably overleveled for this.
[33:03.21]That, like, come on.
[33:04.31]I can do it, right?
[33:04.89]Necromancer Garrus.
[33:15.42]Necromancer Garrus is going to fucking die in another one hit.
[33:23.69]Alright, I got him.
[33:28.33]Doesn't come back, right?
[33:30.31]Family heads?
[33:35.24]What the hell is that?
[33:38.76]I'm sorry.
[33:39.54]I'm sorry, Garrus.
[33:40.56]I was way more overprepared.
[33:43.30]It's a staff!
[33:47.14]Three bludgeoning copper heads attached to it.
[33:49.68]It's a flail!
[33:53.46]The heads were made to resemble those of his wife and two children.
[34:01.72]Gently rattle the copper heads to summon vengeful spirits that chase down foes.
[34:06.58]The anguish of a spouse and children invites a cursed wrath.
[34:11.12]Hold on.
[34:11.44]Let me see this thing.
[34:14.08]Oh my god, this thing's fucking morbid.
[34:18.27]What does it do?
[34:24.32]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[34:33.76]Interesting.
[34:34.50]Alright.
[34:34.94]Well, that's cool.
[34:38.20]I don't think I want to go to the beginning of the dungeon.
[34:47.13]That is an actual... That's a baby rattle.
[34:49.81]Well, it's a...
[34:54.59]Yeah, it's a, it's a flail that has some stuff, it's attached to something.
[35:02.77]This is the baby rattle.
[35:04.93]Hurry up and fucking style like it.
[35:07.39]Alright, that was cool.
[35:09.33]Hitting the Necromancer, I'm sure 70 to 80 levels ago.
[35:14.73]May have been a tad more difficult, but you know, it is what it is.
[35:18.41]I'm here for the spell.
[35:23.70]Okay, and we're already here.
[35:30.04]Black Knife Assassin.
[35:34.20]I can see the footprint.
[35:39.17]Okay, I would be really scared right now if I couldn't just do this.
[35:45.75]Okay.
[35:54.92]Hmm, I don't have any mana left.
[35:56.46]Oh shit.
[35:56.80]What the fuck?
[36:17.61]Oh, I just got him.
[36:24.89]Alright.
[36:26.75]That would have been so awful back at like level 60 or 80.
[36:30.41]Concealing Veil.
[36:37.10]Conceals wear while crouching.
[36:38.66]What?!
[36:42.55]What do you mean?
[36:43.65]It's invisible?
[36:53.13]Am I invisible?
[36:55.63]How can I tell if I'm invisible?
[36:56.75]Cool.
[37:03.06]That's really cool.
[37:03.80]Is it just bizarre?
[37:09.96]Let's put this back on.
[37:13.72]What's here?
[37:14.00]Oh, the damaged one.
[37:14.87]Damaged one.
[37:17.15]Alright, so that is not what I wanted.
[37:20.27]I wanted to go over here.
[37:24.23]This is not the way I wanted to go.
[37:31.78]Can I get out of here somewhere else?
[37:36.62]Can I keep going?
[37:41.44]You need to go to Volcano Manor and then around the volcano.
[37:44.38]You have to go around the entire mountain.
[37:48.76]Alright, well... Okay.
[37:53.82]So, if I go here, I can... Can I go, like, this way?
[37:57.21]Instructions to find Comet Azura in alert channel.
[38:03.17]Oh, shit.
[38:10.16]Okay.

[39:00.13]Go left from that castle past some lava fields and through some rocks.
[39:03.20]You'll go past some advanced shacks.
[39:05.66]Beyond those is a magic boss.
[39:07.86]Oh my god, this is a lot.
[39:09.62]I gotta do this step by step.

[39:36.86]Why?
[39:37.20]Okay, wait a minute.

[40:37.60]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[40:38.78]I'm way too underleveled for this.
[40:40.16]I'm way too underleveled.
[40:41.10]This game's fucking stupid.
[40:42.54]How was I supposed to know I wasn't supposed to be here?
[40:43.99]And he turned around.
[40:46.45]Smart.
[40:50.89]He's complaining to his chat right now.

[41:29.42]This is an elaborate April Fools drill to get me to come over here.
[41:33.60]Alright.
[41:33.96]Can I kill the Tibia Mariner in three hits?
[41:36.37]What do you guys think?
[41:46.31]Where'd he go?

[41:52.35]Three hits.
[41:52.67]Here we go.
[41:56.10]One.
[41:58.56]Nope.
[41:59.04]Not gonna happen.
[42:00.44]Two.
[42:00.62]You got a lot more.
[42:02.76]You got a ton of health this time.
[42:08.12]I don't even... Oh, he must be resistant to cults.
[42:19.69]Don't be an idiot.
[42:25.15]I thought he just knocked him over.
[42:26.25]I thought that was way too much of, like, a wave that the skeleton made.
[42:33.53]Okay.
[42:35.21]Could be a mariner.
[42:36.29]Dead.
[42:39.49]What is it going to be?

[42:47.17]Easy class.
[42:52.18]Hibiya's summons.
[43:00.38]It's a sorcery.
[43:01.10]Oh, it's an int and faith.
[43:04.19]28 int, 20 faith.
[43:06.43]Summons a group of those lost in death.
[43:08.37]Three skeletons will appear from some distance from the caster.
[43:11.71]Are they huge?
[43:14.67]I don't want the faith.
[43:15.51]That's cool, though.
[43:16.05]Okay, wait.
[43:20.33]I don't want to fuck with the instructions.
[43:24.91]We'll come to a castle.
[43:25.83]Go left from that castle past some lava fields.
[43:29.87]Shit.
[43:31.73]Oh, fuck.
[43:32.83]I messed it up.
[43:34.55]Wait, where are we?
[43:40.98]Not near the castle yet.
[43:41.86]Okay, so I just keep going this way?
[43:50.82]Over here?
[43:58.10]With his Grace.
[43:59.18]I think this is it.
[44:09.50]Yes!
[44:10.04]Okay, this is definitely it.
[44:10.86]But how do I get up there?
[44:20.94]Stay at the bottom.
[44:21.85]Over here?
[44:27.85]Following the instructions, monkey.
[44:34.21]Garage.
[44:39.33]At the end of the canyon is the castle.
[44:40.55]Oh my god.
[44:46.49]Oh my god, fucking lava bursts!
[44:49.57]Watch out!
[44:49.93]I think I have... How many do I have?
[44:56.68]I have five.
[44:57.34]I can do another flask upgrade.
[45:01.52]That hurts.
[45:01.82]Hold on.
[45:09.59]What's that?
[45:14.23]Ooh.
[45:14.61]He doesn't know.
[45:21.87]He doesn't know.
[45:22.75]What do I not know?
[45:23.30]Can you please be nicer?
[45:25.30]My little brother is watching.
[45:30.88]I'll say 50% less swears for the next 30 minutes.
[45:40.82]See the water.
[45:45.45]It's getting it off me.
[45:48.81]I want to yell it so bad.
[45:52.11]I want to just put like epic music and just do the intro as hard as I can.
[46:03.90]Fuck.
[46:04.94]Oh, this is a dungeon.
[46:11.36]Interesting.
[46:15.44]Load some dung, Ato.
[46:19.73]Wait.
[46:22.77]That it?
[46:24.31]No.
[46:24.97]There's actually nothing in here.
[46:32.16]Please do it.
[46:36.86]That's like... That's just me.
[46:39.27]That's just... You want me to do a fan... Like a fan dub.
[46:43.93]You want me to do a dub?
[46:44.83]Like a fan dub.
[46:46.37]On stream.
[46:54.28]Poison.
[46:55.02]I'll think about it.
[47:07.89]What if I get it wrong, though?
[47:09.05]I might not get it right.
[47:16.29]Who cares?
[47:16.85]Okay.
[47:19.84]You will get it wrong.
[47:20.96]I probably will get it right, actually, because I've seen the intro of fucking absolute shit all the time.
[47:25.62]I'm gonna get poisoned, but who gives a shit?
[47:30.98]Alright, I gotta pay attention, because I can't talk about that right now.
[47:34.72]No illusory walls.
[48:06.57]When will you learn it's illusory?
[48:08.67]Illusory.
[48:11.59]Illusory.
[48:12.11]Illusory wall.
[48:16.49]Illusory?
[48:20.29]Do it phonetically like bump dash bump dab dash bump Illusory illusory Illusory illusory that sucks.

[49:20.45]Illusory.
[49:22.95]I don't even know how it was said.
[49:24.25]Somebody said it and I just don't remember.
[49:25.93]Okay, well this is a bunch of free shit right here.
[49:42.53]I actually could have just walked in and done that.
[49:55.55]I had mana?
[49:56.74]What?
[49:58.84]Fuck up.
[50:01.32]Fuck up.
[50:02.18]There's no way I don't have mana.
[50:12.17]Mushroom body, mushroom arms, mushroom legs.
[50:25.63]Mushroom body.
[50:26.97]Mushrooms found growing all over the body.
[50:28.95]These overgrown mushrooms have colonized the torso.
[50:32.47]Those enraptured by the scarlet rot, they are holy vestments that root one to the Earth.
[50:53.27]Wait, hold on.
[51:02.15]It just looks like... Hold on.
[51:04.03]Put my, like, weapons away.
[51:05.09]And just, like, sit on the ground.
[51:07.37]Okay.
[51:19.96]I now have a rune arc on me.
[51:23.16]Like, just sit here in the corner.
[51:25.16]And just have like an item on me.
[51:36.60]Well, we're taking that off.
[51:48.04]Oh, no.
[51:52.28]Bullgoat armor.
[51:54.74]Holy shit, that's actually... I'm not at heavy, right?
[51:58.26]As long as it's at medium, I'm fine.
[52:08.13]Dragon gauntlets?
[52:09.97]I can put the bullgoat stuff on.
[52:11.69]Almost the whole thing.
[52:12.27]Can I put the whole thing on?
[52:14.53]No.
[52:15.29]Nope.
[52:18.28]My pants have to be light.
[52:20.46]Oh no, I can't wear pants at all.
[52:23.53]I can wear these trousers.
[52:28.31]Actually, I don't hate this.
[52:32.65]This is actually... I didn't realize that.
[52:38.07]I didn't realize that they came out like that.
[52:42.44]Clipping through the hat.
[52:43.68]Damn it!
[52:44.78]I can't wear it.
[52:45.36]That'll drive me fucking crazy.
[52:51.36]I like this the most, I think.
[52:53.17]No, the blue one.
[52:55.01]This one.
[52:57.37]Yeah, this is my favorite so far.
[53:06.22]I want like blue.
[53:11.16]Yeah, I like that.
[53:13.77]That's really cool.
[53:14.29]That matches really well.
[53:15.09]The whole thing matches now.
[53:21.81]Okay, well, now where?
[53:26.23]Nowhere else to go.
[53:38.36]Where am I supposed to go from here?
[53:42.92]Uh, that way?
[53:59.42]Honest to God, dude.
[53:59.98]Fuck off.
[54:19.16]He can't even cast.
[54:20.02]There's four people.
[54:20.98]It doesn't matter how much HP that I have.
[54:23.54]There's four people shooting at me.
[54:27.11]You know what?
[54:27.55]Stop.
[54:29.81]You know what I mean?
[54:35.46]No, don't get... I already went this way.
[54:47.59]We're gonna go that way.
[54:55.08]Yeah, because this is like the end of the waterfall or something?
[54:58.11]Or can I go here?
[54:59.59]Oh no, I can't go here.
[55:00.25]What?!
[55:05.39]Why did that happen?
[55:26.74]Oh, thank god it was one of those right there.
[55:29.28]That's actually not a bad thing.
[55:36.08]That was a good thing.
[55:36.80]I got a refill of my flask.
[55:43.68]Okay, so be careful because it keeps going.
[55:45.80]Okay.
[55:53.74]I got kind of unlucky, didn't I?
[55:55.64]I got really unlucky.
[55:56.46]This is safe.
[56:06.76]Sir Gideon Andy?
[56:12.02]Oraloo, Andy.
[56:13.67]Chieftain of the Badlands.
[56:15.93]The effa-brilliant Goldmask Andy.
[56:20.89]The loathsome Dung Eater Andy.
[56:24.50]You guys really know how to ruin things, don't you?
[56:34.98]Oh, okay, alright.
[56:35.92]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[56:40.67]Okay.
[56:43.39]I have to hit you once.
[56:51.03]I'm so glad I'm not doing you at the correct level, because this would suck.
[56:54.21]Alright, almost killed him in one hit.
[57:02.92]That was pretty cool.
[57:04.08]Alright, cool.
[57:04.58]Kindred of Wrath's Exaltation.
[57:21.89]Yeah, it's definitely... Okay.
[57:23.17]Poisoning or rot in vicinity increases attack power.
[57:28.52]Raise attack power when poisoning or rot occurs in the vicinity.
[57:32.76]Raise attack power when blood loss occurs in the vicinity.
[57:34.82]Okay.
[57:42.33]Could be good for Millenia.
[57:45.67]Oh, shit.
[57:49.39]Tell that person they're gonna get VIP'd and then don't do it.
[57:54.00]You know what I mean?
[57:54.46]Like, the thought is there.
[58:08.21]The loathsome Andy.
[58:11.45]Sir Gideon Andy.
[58:12.71]Oh my god.
[58:13.43]Like, that's so... I hate it.
[58:18.89]Okay, so I was... That was kinda cool.
[58:20.67]I didn't do any of this shit.
[58:25.26]The loathsome ass-eater!
[58:31.42]Eww!
[58:32.04]Eww!
[58:32.66]Eww!
[58:33.50]Eww!
[58:34.86]I'm sorry, I'm overdoing it.
[58:35.98]The loathsome ass-eater!
[58:48.07]Stop!
[58:48.51]This thing's stupid!
[58:50.93]The loathsome ass- imagine that was his name.
[59:03.69]Oh!
[59:03.81]Hey!
[59:05.98]I can see it!
[59:09.34]That's the castle that VRJaw said.
[59:18.71]This is a fucking long way to get over here.
[59:34.78]Okay.
[59:36.72]Wait, what the fuck?
[59:38.16]What?
[59:42.98]This is not right.
[59:44.30]I'm all the way across the whole thing now.
[59:50.83]Wait, what does it say?
[59:52.63]When you get to the castle, go left from that castle past some lava fields and through some rocks.
[60:00.27]You circle around the whole thing.
[60:09.24]And Sir Gideon Ass Eater!
[60:11.63]The Lovesome Dung Eater!
[60:20.97]I'm sorry.
[60:22.43]Is this it?
[60:25.20]What the fuck is with all these random bosses?
[60:39.03]Another, okay, Magma Wyrm.
[60:42.37]It's fine, don't even get up, stay here.
[60:44.93]Do not go into the lava.
[61:06.74]Frost him!
[61:07.16]Come on!
[61:07.62]Frost him!
[61:08.06]There it is.
[61:13.80]Yeah!
[61:24.34]Let's end it with a flashy move.
[61:31.67]Alright, I'm slowly cleaning up all this shit that I didn't do.
[61:36.69]Dragonheart.
[61:38.33]New draconic power is available.
[61:40.71]Okay, so.
[61:43.31]You come to a castle, go left.
[61:45.45]That circle past some lava fields and through some rocks.
[61:48.07]You'll go past some abandoned shacks.
[61:51.79]So you want to go through the lava.
[61:55.59]Like this way.
[62:01.55]What about Alexander?
[62:02.89]What?
[62:09.92]This hurts.
[62:21.77]You need the boots?
[62:40.45]Oh, mountain of fire!
[62:42.71]Bake me in your flames!
[62:51.58]Ah, sir.
[62:53.60]What business might you have in such a place as this?
[62:56.57]He's still alive.
[62:57.17]Jar!
[63:18.79]I can't heal.
[63:19.45]Okay.
[63:19.85]Okay.
[63:20.11]Anything else?
[63:47.95]No, what did he say?
[63:51.03]Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak.
[63:55.07]Flame of ruin.
[64:00.01]I burnt the Ur tree, though.
[64:03.15]Can he still do that?
[64:03.89]Okay.
[64:17.76]What's the jar on?
[64:20.86]Hold on, Torrent's like dead.
[64:23.22]Is it a helmet?
[64:28.21]Jar.
[64:29.99]Jar that fits cleanly over the head when upturned.
[64:32.35]Made with pride by Iron Fist Alexander.
[64:35.21]In a uniquely jar-like gesture of friendship, it boosts the power of throwing pot items.
[64:44.18]That's so dumb.
[64:51.97]You could summon him for the Fire Giant?
[64:53.43]Really?
[64:53.76]That's cool.
[65:01.22]That's really cool.
[65:05.28]Alright, so I keep going.
[65:06.18]And then this says, find the abandoned shacks.
[65:15.80]What is this?
[65:22.53]I miss when the jar was yelling.
[65:24.15]Roar and loo!
[65:26.85]Chieftain of the Badlands!
[65:34.71]Get it?
[65:39.22]I think so.
[65:46.16]Ah, okay.
[66:02.35]I don't wanna f- This route sucks, by the way.
[66:08.81]Um, you drove me, like, you gave me directions through, like, three bosses.
[66:15.13]It's the only way?
[66:17.76]Why is this place riddled with fucking animals and bosses?
[66:20.74]That hurt a lot.
[66:22.80]This is literally the only way.
[66:24.14]Alright, well now I have to fight one of these?
[66:33.69]That was rude, but I just did.
[66:34.95]It didn't even hurt him.
[66:37.40]Where did all these people come from?
[66:43.00]What the fuck?
[66:43.80]Alright, I have to actually pay attention to this.
[66:54.57]Oh my god.
[66:56.03]Why are you...
[67:02.14]Get on the fucking horse and get me out of here.
[67:06.62]I'm gonna go up the fucking cliff.
[67:07.64]I know it.
[67:10.89]God!
[67:11.17]I don't even know what the fuck I am.
[67:22.27]Am I?
[67:22.69]Where is this, um... Where did I go?
[67:24.84]Aw, damn it, man.
[67:33.37]Oh my god.
[67:34.49]Damn it.
[67:43.60]I'm running by it.
[67:44.54]I don't want to fight that.
[67:45.52]I was already going too fast.
[67:46.68]I could have just... The thing jumped from, like, stage left.
[67:49.84]And I saw, like, the corner of it.
[67:52.56]I should have just kept going.
[67:53.62]I should have just... I got way too overconfident.
[67:55.58]Because I killed every boss in, like, less than 10 seconds.
[67:58.14]And that bear was not easy.
[68:01.16]That was horrible.
[68:13.64]Go around the lava?
[68:15.72]I'm already here.
[68:16.21]Okay.
[68:23.25]Don't care about this.
[68:24.47]Just go this way.
[68:31.20]Where is he?
[68:35.94]Wait, what's in here?
[68:38.88]What?
[68:41.74]Roiling magma?
[68:50.30]Okay, there he is.
[68:57.84]Items?
[69:08.31]Spraying his ankle?
[69:09.03]What was that?
[69:12.61]Don't you fucking dare.
[69:17.79]Get the fuck out of here.
[69:19.07]How did they even get up here?
[69:20.86]How did they get up here?
[69:21.88]You can't jump up here.
[69:24.44]Do you see how you can't do that?
[69:27.22]I had to use the horse.
[69:27.98]I didn't want to do that dumb fucking move.
[69:38.75]You can't get up here, right?
[69:39.79]Oh my god.
[69:41.55]This is not possible.
[69:43.17]You cannot jump up here.
[69:58.06]He's so menacing.
[70:00.30]Did he shed out a little bear?
[70:01.70]What was that?
[70:06.18]Where did that other bear come from?
[70:40.32]That was so terrible.
[70:42.33]He was just slowly rolling.
[70:50.09]That was so weird.
[70:52.33]That was just so sad.
[70:53.71]It rolled so far.
[70:56.15]It rolled from here slowly all the way over there in tiny revolutions.
[71:01.81]That was so awful.
[71:04.65]Oh my god, I feel awful.
[71:06.33]My whole body feels bad.
[71:09.32]Rolled for a full two minutes?
[71:20.03]Okay, so now we're here.
[71:30.61]That slow.
[71:31.73]Pulley crossbow.
[71:32.79]Wow.
[71:34.35]Pulley crossbow.
[71:35.87]Let me see it.
[71:36.67]Okay.
[71:39.94]Cool.
[71:42.28]Crossbow made with pulleys and power springs.
[71:48.84]One in the chat if anyone's fired this weapon.
[71:57.82]Liars.
[72:12.56]I think I have enough to level up.
[72:18.54]What level am I?
[72:20.00]140?
[72:21.72]I need 139.
[72:22.08]I think I got it.
[72:26.74]That's actually kind of nice.
[72:30.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[72:31.72]Wait, hold on.
[72:32.10]Wait.
[72:35.84]I have Horaluz?
[72:38.44]I do?
[72:38.74]Did I look at this?
[72:43.68]Why did I not break that?
[72:44.30]139 is what I need.
[73:05.85]Did you beat that boss?
[73:07.29]Nope.
[73:08.81]Nope, I'm preparing for that boss.
[73:11.61]Because she kicked the ever-living shit out of me.
[73:14.59]A day and a half ago.
[73:16.61]I turned purple.
[73:20.25]Alright, I was horrible.
[73:22.16]Do I really not have enough?
[73:35.56]What?
[73:36.20]No.
[73:43.18]No.
[73:43.82]Dude.
[73:45.42]How could you even consider it?
[73:47.96]I just saw a huge bunch, like a big crowd of enemies.
[73:51.82]And I'm like, alright.
[73:52.46]And then I realized what it was.
[73:53.43]And I just, for a second, I was like... Are these sheep?
[74:00.89]Okay, I thought these were sheep.
[74:03.71]Okay.
[74:04.97]Stay with the sheep.
[74:06.41]Get away from the sheep.
[74:07.38]Sheep, get out of here.
[74:09.28]I don't want to accidentally kill the entire fucking family.
[74:12.48]139 is what I need.
[74:19.32]Bones?
[74:19.64]Okay, I need 139 for God's sakes.
[74:26.34]Whatever.
[74:26.54]I don't...
[74:35.38]We're on the right track.
[74:40.23]Now, last time I did, like, a sheep sound, everybody fucking freaked out.
[74:43.05]And, like, people left the stream.
[74:44.09]People were like, shut the fuck up.
[74:46.21]Like, it wasn't, like, people, it wasn't funny.
[74:48.68]It was like, I'm leaving, don't fucking do, like, a dumb sheep sound.
[74:52.66]Do you remember that?
[74:54.56]I don't think you guys remember, like, the sheep that I did.
[74:57.80]And everyone got really mad.
[75:00.00]It wasn't, like, funny mad.
[75:01.57]It was like, don't fucking do that again, dude.
[75:02.95]That wasn't funny.
[75:03.55]That sucked.
[75:06.04]I distinctly remember that, and I was like, holy shit, people really didn't like that.
[75:11.25]Again, I'm not messing around.
[75:12.57]It wasn't like, dude, what the fuck?
[75:14.45]It was like a don't fucking do that again.
[75:21.94]Okay!
[75:23.14]What the fuck is happening in this game today?
[75:25.76]Okay.
[75:42.81]He didn't even know he died.
[75:47.83]He just got cut in half.
[75:52.13]Long ways.
[75:53.33]Like, he was just like, I'm ready.
[75:54.61]Okay, here we go.
[75:57.51]He's gonna go like this.
[76:02.50]He's gonna go in half.
[76:04.10]He's not even gonna know.
[76:06.67]Why are they all so fucked up today?
[76:08.17]Don't you feel like the enemies are weird today?
[76:12.68]Something weird is going on.
[76:16.38]What's happening?
[76:17.06]Why is everyone so fucked up?
[76:24.71]Go level up.
[76:39.19]You're living eternally in a 1900 slapstick movie.
[76:50.78]You know, I miss, like, the piano playing.
[76:53.08]Like, the classic piano.
[77:00.79]With people just getting hit and, like, hitting each other and stuff.
[77:02.79]And, like, falling down stairs and stuff.
[77:05.17]Like, that's fucking hilarious.
[77:10.96]Endurance, probably, right?
[77:11.96]Or 60, yeah.
[77:12.86]There's a scene in Leslie Nielsen, in one of the Naked Gun movies, where, like, he's in an apartment, like, doing an investigation, looking for, like, a clue.
[77:27.11]And he, like, bumps into an automatic, he bumps into a piano?
[77:30.15]Like, he falls over and, like, he bumps into a piano.
[77:34.19]And starts playing this, like, classical, like, automatic piano music.
[77:40.12]And he starts, like, falling into the walls and breaking shit.
[77:44.14]And he, like, ends up burning the whole place down or something.
[77:50.13]I remember just laughing at the piano.
[77:51.85]I don't know if pianos do it to me.
[77:56.63]I think we're really missing, like, the old high school theater old lady that plays the piano.
[78:03.76]Do you guys remember that?
[78:04.74]I don't know what it's like in, like, high school now.
[78:07.16]Or, like, middle school now.
[78:09.30]But there was one old lady that did the entire soundtrack of the entire play.
[78:15.87]And it was a little scuffed.
[78:18.61]It was always a little bit scuffed.
[78:21.91]But this lady worked it all night.
[78:25.33]All night.
[78:26.43]Every song, every tense moment, all the tense music.
[78:34.22]I... What is that?
[78:41.32]Hold on, I just got a cool weapon.
[78:50.48]Whatever, just fucking go.
[79:01.32]This is boss alley.
[79:03.56]This literally is boss alley.
[79:06.87]They all decided to hang out here.
[79:11.59]This probably would have taken like 15 in-game hours to go through this place.
[79:14.85]Like at level 60 or 70 when you're supposed to be here.
[79:28.00]What the fuck?
[79:29.08]There's casters here.
[79:43.34]get out of here how many people are here
[80:11.48]Fuck!
[80:12.68]Can you imagine the old lady playing the piano right now?
[80:20.90]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[80:43.70]And sometimes you could hear her, like, say a fucking really, really bad swear, too.
[80:46.80]She'd be like, ah, fuck!
[80:50.40]She'd be like, ah, this bitch is shit.
[80:51.82]Like, she'd turn her music over, and she'd swear.
[80:53.82]It was fucking bad.
[80:55.34]It was like Jesus.
[81:15.66]Okay, so what did I just get?
[81:16.78]Oh, a memory stone.
[81:26.95]Ah, that's alright.
[81:34.18]I'm not going up there yet.
[81:43.54]Most OP spell in the game.
[81:45.00]Alright, so... Okay.
[81:45.52]Comet Azure.
[81:58.05]Can you talk?
[81:59.81]Can you talk?
[82:16.16]Can I do anything else?
[82:18.44]Alright, I want to see what this does.
[82:25.80]Let's play ragtime music.
[82:27.75]Oh wait, I got something over here too.
[82:28.89]Roiling Magma.
[82:30.55]Int Faith.
[82:31.87]Okay, a lot of these fire spells are Int Faith.
[82:34.35]That's kind of interesting.
[82:39.45]Okay, where is it?
[82:40.03]Fire is a tremendous comment within a starry torrent.
[82:51.27]It takes three slots.
[82:53.13]Holy shit.
[83:06.36]Wow.
[83:16.61]Okay, I have the appointment so theoretically I already have this on if I do this Oh my goodness
[83:48.16]It's not gonna work versus them.
[83:51.64]There's a hair in here.
[83:53.36]And I gotta get it out.
[84:04.65]I got it.
[84:05.59]Oh!
[84:06.65]Oh my god, this is one of my hairs!
[84:10.53]This is long.
[84:11.43]This is like one of my hairs.
[84:13.50]What the fuck?
[84:14.20]It was in there.
[84:14.80]It coiled up.
[84:15.66]That's disgusting.
[84:19.45]Okay, so, um, you say that's not going to work versus... Alright.
[84:26.80]Where is the other spell?
[84:28.38]Somebody said there are... I see there's a few super spells.
[84:31.38]I want to get them because this is it.
[84:33.86]It's not... I'm not... This is it.
[84:38.52]This is it.
[84:39.50]Is there another one?
[84:40.05]Go talk to Sellen in Limgrave.
[84:45.05]Rock Sling is really good.
[84:47.75]The other one... Talk to Sellen about this guy.
[84:50.21]We have it already.
[84:53.35]It's Swarm of Flies.
[84:54.77]Sellen's quest.
[84:58.55]Use that when you dodge the big flower in phase two.
[85:01.29]Oh, man.
[85:03.02]Can we just do it now?
[85:04.20]Let's just... Let's just go do it now.
[85:07.34]Let's go do it right now.
[85:07.96]Let's go kill her right now.
[85:08.88]What do you guys think?
[85:10.38]What do you guys think?
[85:12.08]Do it right now?
[85:12.98]First try?
[85:14.96]We go do it first try?
[85:15.78]We do it right now?
[85:17.31]You think...
[85:44.89]Flintstone Pebble is better.
[85:46.03]Okay.
[85:51.59]Last charges.
[85:52.54]Uh, I'm gonna say ten and four.
[85:57.56]Let's just see.
[86:00.10]We gotta get to phase two.
[86:01.80]I'm not using this until phase two.
[86:04.97]If I beat this, if I drink that flask and melt her...
[86:11.67]Probably gonna get a lot of shit for it, because you didn't beat Millenia the way that I did.
[86:17.10]Which was so level 80.
[86:19.36]And, uh, a short sword.
[86:21.86]Well, I'm sorry.
[86:22.94]But... Let's go.
[86:28.57]Bombo?
[86:29.59]You ready?
[86:40.04]Alright, Millenia.
[86:47.18]Begin the process.
[86:48.42]Come on, Mama.
[86:52.58]Both headphones gotta go in, otherwise this ain't happening.
[87:13.99]Stagger!
[87:16.19]Where's the stagger?
[87:18.17]Oh my god.
[87:35.84]Do it right away?
[87:36.64]No fucking chance, man.
[87:38.22]I gotta get her phase two.
[87:41.05]She stands still in phase two for like five to ten straight seconds when she lands.
[87:51.26]And you know what?
[87:51.88]We're going rune arc as well.
[87:55.45]Let's do it.
[87:58.11]On boat!
[87:58.41]Let's do it.
[88:04.03]Can I get two moons off?
[88:07.17]No.
[88:07.35]I don't think so.
[88:08.87]Let's fuck.
[88:09.27]Who cares?
[88:09.71]Let's do it.
[88:14.79]Got it.
[88:15.89]Okay, let's go.
[88:23.29]Come on, Bombo.
[88:23.87]Fire!
[88:24.43]They're in the fire.
[88:45.16]Nooo!
[88:48.44]Oh... Fuck!
[89:10.20]Have you tried dodging that attack?
[89:11.34]I don't think you can.
[89:16.32]By the time you dodge the first part of it, the animation is still happening.
[89:21.36]You can.
[89:22.36]It's just hard.
[89:25.03]This boss is dumb.
[89:26.63]I can't wait to burn her face off with this fucking spell.
[89:55.56]In the fire.
[89:55.92]Good, good, good, good, good.
[89:56.50]Keep the stagger up.
[89:59.57]Alright, back up.
[90:01.81]Back up, back up, back up.
[90:02.69]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[90:18.26]I'm paranoid that she's going to do it again.
[90:26.84]I'm so paranoid.
[90:27.48]She's going to do it again.
[90:28.10]She's going to do it again.
[90:28.86]Right?
[90:29.10]Like, she's going to do it again right now.
[90:38.05]Oh, my God.
[90:42.15]I just can't even see.
[90:48.56]I don't want to use the laser spell yet.
[90:55.24]She never does it twice in a row?
[90:56.58]I feel like I've seen her do it twice in a row.
[91:03.33]Use the moon blade?
[91:05.85]Bro, that's the only move I'm doing this whole entire fight.
[91:09.81]You know what?
[91:10.19]Fuck it.
[91:10.45]Let's just see what happens.
[91:11.15]I'm just doing it right now.
[91:11.94]Go!
[91:18.92]What?
[91:30.93]It doesn't work.
[91:36.85]It's gonna work in phase two.
[91:38.68]Because she stands still for like five straight seconds in phase two.
[91:44.42]I have to get her to phase two.
[91:47.08]Just kill me.
[91:47.56]I don't want to waste flasks for no reason.
[91:49.56]Just kill me.
[92:05.12]She's really weak to bleed?
[92:06.22]I can get her down.
[92:10.12]I've gotten her to phase two plenty of times.
[92:11.88]It's just doing it.
[92:15.67]You need to play ragtime piano.
[92:17.42]It's the only way.
[92:18.24]You know, I've considered it.
[92:24.78]I considered it.
[92:32.27]Um... Ragtime piano music royalty free?
[93:04.46]Whatever.
[93:05.40]Come on, Bombo!
[93:06.26]Let's go!
[94:20.25]Fuck!
[94:25.04]Please!
[94:25.66]Mambo aggro!
[94:33.14]Just full health again!
[94:34.48]Oh god damn it!
[94:54.39]There's no fucking way.
[94:56.00]Not anymore.
[94:56.54]Not without Mambo.
[95:02.86]Mambo, I, like, she just, okay.
[95:05.92]You live by the summon, you die by the summon.
[95:07.82]She generates almost 100% of her health back.
[95:10.98]If she does that to the summon, she just ate him fucking alive.
[95:16.61]That was stupid.
[95:18.41]She shouldn't be able to gain health from the summon.
[95:19.93]The summon doesn't have any blood!
[95:51.97]This is gonna be so hard without Mabo.
[96:10.02]I'm so afraid she's gonna do it.
[96:12.16]Just do it already!
[96:15.10]Just do it!
[96:19.28]I know you're gonna do it.
[96:20.24]Just do it already!
[96:26.41]Do it already!
[96:55.66]I got the- Black and white filter.
[97:13.42]I'll talk with one of these accents.
[97:16.09]That sounds like a good idea.
[97:17.17]Okay, that sounds fun to me.
[97:24.39]Add, like, fucking grainy- Alright, hold on.
[97:26.41]Uh...
[97:58.55]whole thing what if I beat her it's gonna be ruined the clip is gonna be ruined
[98:27.79]Hold on a second.
[98:29.07]Hold on.
[98:29.63]I need a... I wish I... I wish I had a cigarette.
[98:42.32]I need like a suit jacket too, you know what I mean?
[98:53.53]Oh, what?
[98:53.79]This could be a cigarette.
[98:56.47]It's clean.
[98:56.83]Listen.
[98:59.55]Listen to me.
[99:01.99]The lady down here.
[99:06.39]Really have to try.
[99:10.20]A new tactic, I think.
[99:14.36]Fellas.
[99:14.62]Fellas, listen to me.
[99:17.66]The new tactic is gonna go like this.
[99:20.88]I'm thinking we wait till we get to the bottom.
[99:22.96]Radio filter, yep.
[99:24.01]That's true.
[99:26.38]Good call.
[99:28.94]Actually, good call.
[99:29.60]Let me make sure I get this right.
[99:42.33]Okay, so.
[99:43.61]How's that?
[99:47.93]Okay, so what we're gonna do here, just wanna make sure I get this right.
[99:55.83]Gosh, darling.
[99:57.94]Gosh, darling.
[99:59.48]Okay.
[100:00.80]Let's go ahead and bring this up a little bit here.
[100:05.64]How's that sound?
[100:06.18]Does that sound better?
[100:07.58]Does that sound good?
[100:08.84]How does that sound?
[100:10.01]Maybe a little bit lower.
[100:11.85]That's a little too much.
[100:12.79]I think that's a little too much.
[100:13.61]Yeah, I think so.
[100:15.25]No, maybe like that.
[100:19.03]You see?
[100:20.13]How's that?
[100:21.61]Okay, that sounds pretty good to me.
[100:24.23]Now let's go ahead and get this started, I say.
[100:25.77]You know what I say.
[100:26.61]I'll tell you, I'm gonna be hollering here.
[100:32.08]I'm gonna be hollering here.
[100:38.22]Okay.
[100:42.08]Now listen, Buster.
[100:45.32]Once we get down here, I'm gonna make sure that we take care of this as soon as possible.
[100:53.28]I'm thinking summoning Mambo for the first quadrant of this fight.
[101:03.16]Mambo, why don't you come sailing out here, please?
[101:05.76]That sounds good to me.
[101:08.56]Show of the moon.
[101:09.24]Show of the moon.
[101:09.68]What do you say?
[101:10.03]Show of the moon.
[101:10.41]What do you think, Mambo?
[101:11.99]Sure thing.
[101:18.59]Absolutely.
[101:18.99]Oh, rats.
[101:19.49]Rats, rats, rats.
[101:20.79]Rats.
[101:23.20]That looked a little airy there.
[101:28.75]I say you get your hands off him.
[101:30.97]That's my friend Mambo and he's a good friend of mine.
[101:32.81]I say you get your hands off him right now.
[101:35.49]Get your hands off him this instant.
[101:39.59]Oh.
[101:39.79]Oh, great.
[101:44.77]Now she's doing that move.
[101:47.15]Gotta stay very far away from that one.
[101:51.41]Oh, look at her.
[101:52.25]She's sapping him a bowl of tail.
[101:57.25]I say, I don't agree with that.
[101:58.59]I'm going to get real sore with you.
[102:00.73]I'm saying right now, I'm going to get real cross with you.
[102:03.23]If you keep that up.
[102:08.38]Now you listen, Buster.
[102:09.30]You listen here, Jack.
[102:13.56]Here we go, Mambo.
[102:26.28]Now, I don't get that move at all.
[102:29.56]That move is absolutely unbelievable.
[102:32.67]It's one of those moves that you can't do anything about.
[102:34.61]And I'm telling you, yeah.
[102:37.23]You know what else is as ridiculous as that?
[102:39.21]Yeah, like we're going to get planes soon.
[102:40.91]Like I can fly eventually, too.
[102:44.91]No chance.
[102:51.41]We'll never fly.
[102:53.74]All these people talking about getting in the air like a bird.
[102:55.62]That makes absolutely no sense to me.
[102:58.06]None at all.
[103:02.26]Devil talk, if I've ever heard it.
[103:05.04]Satanists.
[103:06.97]Flying around.
[103:10.67]What are they thinking?
[103:14.81]Alright, Mambo, come on.
[103:15.33]Come on.
[103:25.83]What happened to the music?
[103:26.67]I had some good music on here and I don't know what happened to it.
[103:29.53]Not exactly sure.
[103:30.33]I-I-I don't know.
[103:31.81]I don't know where it went.
[103:38.40]Excuse me for one second.
[103:42.98]Now that's better.
[103:48.10]Let's get in here and let's get- let's- let's go ahead and let's stop- stop the bullying!
[103:56.11]that.
[103:58.43]Mambo behind, come on.
[104:02.11]Not that close Mambo please.
[104:05.09]Fuck no!
[104:10.34]Looks like she's gonna heal the whole thing now, because she did that to Mambo.
[104:35.23]I think this could be the one here.
[104:38.09]I'm very certain this could be it.
[104:39.37]Maybe.
[104:39.59]It's possible.
[104:42.31]And then we have to drink that flask immediately and try to get over there as fast as we can.
[105:03.54]What you don't know is back in the 1930s, we never exhaled it.
[105:06.75]It stayed in.
[105:07.21]Permanently.
[105:11.05]We absorbed it into our bloodstream the second we sucked it in.
[105:14.75]And that's a fact for you.
[105:16.93]Now come on, now!
[105:52.30]Fuck you!
[105:53.32]Seriously, that's stupid!
[105:55.60]What?! !
[106:41.84]How many fucking moves do you get before you... I'm sorry about that, folks, but what I meant to say was, how many moves do you get to do in a row before, uh, gosh darn it, you... How many moves do you get to do, gosh darn it, before a fucking wrong thing.
[106:54.23]Wrong thing.
[106:55.21]And now the whole thing's fucked up, folks, so we may as well just do this.
[106:58.31]And say... Fuck you!
[106:59.19]Die!
[106:59.43]I blew the whole thing.
[107:20.84]She walked in.
[107:22.10]She walked in, she sat down at my desk.
[107:27.14]I said, lady, what are you doing in here?
[107:30.51]She gave me one look.
[107:32.51]One quick look in my eye.
[107:35.31]And I knew... Sorry.
[107:38.21]I knew right then when she came and sat out of my office what it was going to be quite an evening.
[107:48.73]I knew right there...
[107:50.58]And the next few days of my life were situated.
[107:53.16]They were stuck.
[107:57.38]Only I could get through this.
[108:01.94]The local paper the next day, yeah, so... All the other people that have died are this woman.
[108:11.54]So I ripped it up.
[108:13.26]And I'm fucking mad.
[108:14.70]It is the only thing keeping me from fucking strangling myself.
[108:17.76]Like, just strangling!
[108:20.11]So she walked me.
[108:21.61]Can I turn it off now, please?
[108:35.88]It doesn't work.
[108:37.00]It makes everything sound horrible and it sucks.
[108:39.89]I say, okay, here we are.
[108:41.85]I'm gonna paint this piece of shit.
[108:59.09]Oh, I lost my hat.
[109:00.89]It's the only thing that's keeping my brain in.
[109:07.33]Oh!
[109:07.99]It's okay.
[109:08.83]Everything's fine.
[109:09.31]Don't worry about it.
[109:10.27]Everything seems to be going very smoothly, as smoothly as it could.
[109:15.34]Just don't want her to do that to Mambo.
[109:18.70]How long is he going to keep this up?
[109:20.72]Probably until he wins.
[109:26.09]Or he runs out of mana.
[109:30.46]This is bad.
[109:33.66]I don't fucking know.
[109:35.96]I gotta turn this off.
[109:36.74]It's fucking with me.
[109:37.90]It's fucking with me.
[109:38.58]I gotta turn it off now.
[109:43.85]Turn it off.
[109:45.99]Turn it off.
[109:48.53]Okay.
[109:51.17]I hate this fucking fight.
[109:52.27]And I hate this piece of shit behind this door.
[110:00.25]Let's bring it back to 1995.
[110:20.70]Okay, let's try this again.
[110:22.98]This time I'm going to try.
[110:23.82]I haven't gotten her to phase two.
[110:26.86]Why can I not get this piece of fucking shit to phase... Oh, fuck this fight.
[110:34.99]I hope I get to cheese the fuck out of this.
[110:36.51]I hope I kill her instantly.
[110:38.85]I hope I kill her instantly in phase two.
[110:40.93]I hope so.
[110:47.50]Get in there!
[110:57.77]Come on!
[110:58.15]Just go!
[110:58.75]Bully!
[110:59.23]Bully!
[110:59.57]Bully!
[110:59.89]Bully!
[111:00.21]Bully!
[111:00.55]Bully!
[111:00.79]It's the only fucking way to fight this!
[111:14.28]Bully!
[111:15.55]Where's the bully?
[111:16.15]Get it!
[111:16.41]Come on!
[111:18.04]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[111:19.14]Back up, back up, back up.
[111:19.86]God damn it.
[111:27.44]Everything that we just did.
[111:31.55]What a pain in the fucking ass.
[111:42.93]Keep it up.
[111:43.23]Keep it.
[111:43.51]Go, go, go, go, go.
[111:44.05]More, more, more, more, more, more, more.
[111:49.24]She's going to go up.
[111:55.15]She's going to go up.
[111:55.95]I just know she's going to go up like right now.
[112:07.05]He's going up.
[112:07.59]She's going up.
[112:08.07]She's going up.
[112:11.13]Hmm.
[112:14.49]When is she gonna... She's gonna go up, like, right now.
[112:16.75]Is she going up?
[112:23.99]She's so fucking paranoid.
[112:35.13]She want... She's gonna do it, right?
[112:43.46]What is going on?
[112:45.40]Okay, she's almost at mana.
[112:47.64]Oh, fuck!
[113:03.71]This is it.
[113:04.05]This is it.
[113:04.49]Alright.
[113:05.27]Fuck this fight.
[113:05.83]Let's go.
[113:07.05]Drink?
[113:08.91]Not yet.
[113:09.23]Not yet.
[113:09.53]Not yet.
[113:20.75]I didn't drink it!
[113:25.90]What?
[113:27.66]What happened?
[113:29.10]Why didn't I drink it?
[113:30.33]I don't care.
[113:32.51]Fuck it.
[113:32.79]We're doing it anyway.
[113:57.33]What did I drink?
[114:03.82]What are you talking about, dude?
[114:19.71]What are you talking?
[114:43.73]EEEE!
[114:58.02]God, this is un-fucking-bearable.
[115:00.00]This is the worst fight they've ever made.
[115:01.56]Without a question.
[115:03.16]Without a solitary question.
[115:19.01]I think you can just run.
[115:20.95]That's the one you gotta... Alright, no, no, no.
[115:22.57]Okay, there's two?
[115:23.81]Two of the thrusts.
[115:27.94]Jesus Christ!
[115:31.22]At least that's the longest I've been able to see what the fuck this piece of shit even does.
[115:37.07]Like, you're so slow, but your moves are so fucking awful!
[115:48.47]This is what happens when you don't have 99 Arcane?! !
[115:56.08]Okay, we're testing.
[115:57.65]If I sprint away, I can sprint away and it won't get me.
[116:01.93]Oh my god.
[116:02.39]Okay, I can run away from that move.
[116:04.51]That's confirmed.
[116:05.83]That's confirmed.
[116:06.44]I can run.
[116:06.80]I mean, at this point, I'm...
[116:24.62]That 1, 2, 3, you can't dodge it.
[116:28.00]This fight sucks.
[116:30.74]See you in two weeks when they fucking come out with patch 1.04 and they're like, well, you know, we like, you know, we nerfed it a little.
[116:45.37]They got a patch 1.04.
[116:46.68]The first tagline is going to be in bold.
[116:49.96]Linea's damage output and healing has been reduced by 25%.
[117:05.77]I'm not going to waste mana on the moons.
[117:06.81]I don't think they're worth it.
[117:07.71]Maybe one moon.
[117:08.35]Let's go.
[117:16.36]I didn't... Why did I not drink the flask?
[117:18.18]I literally pressed the fucking square.
[117:30.64]That is bad.
[117:35.32]That's a broken fucking move.
[117:36.84]It just is.
[117:37.20]Even if you dodge it.
[117:37.80]Like, even if you dodge that shit perfectly, it doing... I have fucking 52 vigor.
[117:43.75]53 vigor.
[117:45.17]It does my entire health bar.
[117:47.61]You have to roll in.
[117:49.77]Yeah, but it's like she keeps going.
[117:50.97]This is stupid.
[117:52.74]This is fucking stupid.
[117:54.14]This is stupid.
[117:55.08]This is stupid.
[117:57.70]Stupid.
[117:58.66]It's stupid.
[118:00.10]It's stupid.
[118:01.24]This is stupid.
[118:02.52]This is stupid.
[118:04.04]It's stupid.
[118:05.08]This is... Just want to make sure you understood.
[118:35.08]Fucking hate that move too.
[118:36.16]That's awful.
[118:39.06]It's the heal shit.
[118:39.70]Just don't let the character heal.
[118:40.70]It's the only character ever that heals.
[118:42.48]You've made fucking 200 bosses FromSoftware.
[118:45.70]You have to have them heal.
[119:00.97]I got backup.
[119:01.45]Backup.
[119:01.69]Excuse me.
[119:22.64]Is she going up?
[119:23.22]Yep, nope.
[119:24.40]She's going up now, right?
[119:28.88]She's going up.
[119:30.70]Yes, she is.
[119:50.32]Come on, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo!
[120:11.12]Don't fuck it up this time.
[120:27.17]What?!
[120:33.33]You motherfucker!
[120:35.51]You motherfucker!
[120:38.40]You motherfucker!
[120:40.38]I'm so mad!
[120:44.34]Jesus Christ, please!
[121:09.53]Drink that blast!
[121:10.73]Right now!
[121:11.27]Drink it!
[121:19.68]Shoot it!
[121:29.11]It doesn't fucking do anything.
[121:32.01]It doesn't fucking do anything.
[121:39.98]Fucking Jesus, I thought Dino was gonna go that far!
[121:50.08]Oh my god, worst fucking fight they've ever fucking made in the history of all of their fucking games.
[122:23.77]I'm not the gargoyle's black blade.
[122:25.65]I'm talking about this fucking thing.
[122:27.44]I'm going back.
[122:28.22]I'm fucking moon veiling this piece of shit.
[122:31.52]You want to be a broken boss?
[122:33.18]I'm going to use the broken katana.
[122:34.60]How does that sound?
[122:36.80]Let's just go to the... Now you fucked.
[122:47.65]Because now I'm angry.
[122:54.17]Now I'm very- Now I'm angry.
[122:58.45]I'm like- Ding!
[123:00.22]Hugue?
[123:02.16]Put every ounce of your strength into this fucking thing.
[123:04.94]Every ounce.
[123:06.88]I'm gonna- Seriously?
[123:08.80]Coat it in everything you could- I don't- What the fuck do you have back there?
[123:12.19]Poison, rot, blood, magic stuff.
[123:14.45]Just dump the whole thing on it.
[123:15.93]Dump everything on it.
[123:18.39]I'll pay you extra.
[123:36.60]This sucks, man!
[123:44.34]Give me the other rune, because this rune's stupid.
[123:46.49]Everything's stupid in this game, apparently.
[123:48.21]Don't you understand?
[123:48.73]Everything's stupid.
[123:55.53]Seven and seven.
[123:59.87]I'll pay extra.
[124:00.55]I will pay extra.
[124:01.27]I'll pay an extra 10,000 runes.
[124:05.34]I don't care what you put in that.
[124:06.92]I want it to be able to kill her.
[124:08.80]I don't care what it is.
[124:09.48]Alright, we're putting Godrick's Rune on.
[124:15.58]I just better work or I'm going to be even more mad.
[124:18.64]I'm going to break.
[124:21.96]I think I have to... I'm going to... What am I... I'm so mad.
[124:30.75]I'm trying to hold it so hard.
[124:32.27]You know what I mean?
[124:32.77]I feel like I like...
[124:37.74]I feel like if you're holding in like a fucking fart and it hurts your stomach, but you're like surrounded by people and you're like, I'm not going to just fart and ruin everybody's day.
[124:45.25]You know what I mean?
[124:46.07]I'm going to have to, I'm holding it in right now.
[124:49.91]It's like if you're in a room with like 10 people and like, oh my God, I got a big gas problem, right?
[124:54.88]Like I'm not just going to fucking rip ass at like something.
[124:58.90]No, I'm holding it.
[125:00.56]I'm holding it and I'm fucking going to go in the bathroom.
[125:13.10]It's 1,800.
[125:13.62]And then probably 2,000.
[125:14.98]I can't cool down.
[125:17.60]I'm so angry.
[125:23.75]I need to cool down.
[125:28.33]Okay.
[125:29.81]I need to cool down.
[125:30.61]I gotta cool it.
[125:31.65]Let's take a rune arc.
[125:35.87]Pretty cool.
[125:36.57]Alright.
[125:37.67]Very cool.
[125:39.78]Use the Mimic tier.
[125:40.56]No, the Mimic tier is the last resort.
[125:44.45]Moonvale is the beta 0.8 last resort.
[125:53.59]I need to sell some shit.
[125:56.15]I wish I could just fucking relax.
[126:00.46]There's like a demon right now that's like, just start screaming!
[126:03.86]That's what we want to do!
[126:05.08]Just scream!
[126:06.14]And I'm like, no, stop, man!
[126:07.58]Relax!
[126:08.06]And he's like, no, we're going to scream in a minute!
[126:16.21]What can I get rid of?
[126:19.59]Just go to the bog spot.
[126:24.99]Stupid fucking boss.
[126:30.66]you know and the music is so good but it's making me hate that song you know what I'm saying like when I hear that like I'm just like hate this I hate this area you're reminding me how much I hate this
[126:56.08]I got the 2,000 runes I need.
[126:59.14]Whatever.
[127:00.18]Shoot it at somebody.
[127:02.68]I thought I killed him.
[127:07.54]And this thing has bleed, too.
[127:09.23]Fucking baby rattle.
[127:10.19]I gotta figure out how to play with this.
[127:26.15]I feel like this is going to be even better.
[127:27.67]I feel like this is not going to even be better.
[127:30.71]Just kill the bird.
[127:35.08]Yeah, you're right, but whatever.
[127:36.86]I gotta remember how to play with this, though.
[127:38.38]L1 is the sideways.
[127:40.58]And R1 is the over.
[127:54.06]It'll be significantly better.
[127:55.62]Oh, no.
[128:02.34]Use the FP talisman.
[128:03.44]Stop telling me what to do!
[128:04.80]Stop!
[128:05.00]I'm fine.
[128:07.24]I gotta stop, like, putting forth the thing where, like, oh, you are the most unhinged Elden Ring streamer.
[128:15.29]I have to keep that in mind.
[128:16.17]I have to make sure I'm, like, somewhere, like, in the middle, right?
[128:18.41]Like, I can't be number one.
[128:19.73]I can't be, like, the guy that everybody points to, like, oh, yeah, go to history.
[128:22.61]He's a fucking psycho.
[128:24.47]No.
[128:25.33]Shh.
[128:26.01]I'm fine, and I'm not gonna say anything else.
[128:30.85]Us nine.
[128:32.61]Bingo.
[128:34.17]Plus 10 moon veil.
[128:36.54]I'm ready.
[128:40.96]I am so pissed.
[128:47.38]Not yet.
[129:02.06]Okay.
[129:02.78]Alright, alright, alright.
[129:03.72]I'm ready to at least give this a try.
[129:05.64]This has bleed as well?
[129:06.78]Okay.
[129:21.09]Do you know about the Wraith Bell cheese?
[129:23.53]I don't.
[129:27.65]So are you saying I should just get up there and just start whacking?
[129:32.30]Just like wham, wham, wham, wham.
[129:37.16]Is that the idea?
[129:37.82]Let's see how this works.
[129:47.06]Come here.
[129:48.01]I feel like I'm gripping the sword way harder.
[129:58.83]Fucking hell.
[129:59.49]Dude, I want a great mechanic.
[130:01.55]Whoop.
[130:07.86]My lady.
[130:40.88]Let's go.
[131:09.73]What the fuck FromSoftware?!
[131:18.31]Get out of the way!
[131:18.79]Get out of the way!
[131:33.88]Oh fuck, I'm dead.
[131:42.07]Dude, it's the camera.
[131:43.18]Okay, like, I know I'm supposed to, like, dodge through her.
[131:46.76]But, like, the camera just fucking, fucking rips around.
[132:06.31]Block the first flurry?
[132:07.65]You should have a shield.
[132:08.33]Do a well to shield.
[132:09.57]Am I just going to come here with two fucking shields and just hope that I win?
[132:13.73]Let me just see if I can... There's no fucking way I'm going to be able to do a toe-to-toe.
[132:27.30]Not a chance at hell.
[132:59.80]Dude.
[133:03.34]You don't stop.
[133:04.56]You don't stop fucking attacking.
[133:08.25]She does not stop attacking.
[133:10.23]Is this intended?
[133:16.39]Is this intended?
[133:17.47]I feel like there's just like a bunch of zeros and ones in the code of Millenia.
[133:23.18]Like somebody just fucking put them there and I forgot to get rid of them.
[133:27.95]I feel like there's just a bunch of zeros and ones that they just like put there.
[133:30.09]Somebody copied and pasted a thousand of them.
[133:32.08]And they like forgot to get rid of them.
[133:35.40]Like, oh shit.
[133:35.94]Yeah, there's like all this.
[133:37.44]We gotta delete that.
[133:38.52]Like, this shouldn't be there.
[133:40.02]That's fucked up.
[133:41.06]Why is that there?
[133:46.61]I don't think this is better.
[133:47.43]I don't think this is helping me out at all.
[134:04.62]That's not doing that much... Dude, I do that much damage with this.
[134:08.18]More than that.
[134:08.60]Way more.
[134:10.24]And it takes the same amount of time.
[134:11.28]Yeah, like that's... This is... Why would I... I'm not... This is awful.
[134:17.51]Okay.
[134:26.29]Look, this does 2,000 damage if I get the frost.
[134:29.87]I don't think this thing's worth using.
[134:34.16]I'm just kind of taking mana that I need.
[134:36.28]I'm dead.
[134:48.61]Use rivers of blood.
[134:51.74]Bombo's not helping.
[134:53.78]Use the staff spin.
[134:54.96]You gotta use it close range to hit with the sword.
[134:56.58]You have to dodge her moves.
[135:00.40]I have a hundred hours in this game.
[135:04.08]I've beaten every single boss except for this one and the next one.
[135:06.51]What are you talking about?
[135:14.11]I didn't run here from the first bonfire.
[135:47.16]God damn it.
[135:48.30]It's just so hard.
[135:50.94]It's just like, she's got so many different timed moves.
[135:55.66]It's like, it's like the worst of every part of every boss in the game.
[136:00.50]It just really is.
[136:01.84]She's the worst of every single encounter in Elden Ring.
[136:06.34]And she heals when she fucking hits you.
[136:08.54]Are you shitting me?
[136:16.24]Why was I crouching?
[136:35.88]STOP ATTACKING!
[136:46.09]Just look at her health, are you fucking kidding me?
[136:49.69]I don't think this is supposed to be like this.
[136:58.42]This is a plus 10 fucking weapon, bro.
[137:04.50]Why can you do this?
[137:14.28]I feel like the people are like, oh, get good.
[137:15.67]Like, get good.
[137:18.23]They pick up the controller and they're here too.
[137:20.23]You're here too.
[137:21.01]You've died 200 times too.
[137:22.83]Hey, get good, man.
[137:23.55]I haven't gotten good either.
[137:26.73]Um, no, you get good.
[137:46.57]Why do you not attack her?
[137:49.57]There's almost no opportunity to attack this boss.
[137:52.83]Uh, every other boss in the whole game.
[137:54.05]Even, even old Redan.
[137:56.38]Old Redan, pre-patch.
[137:58.98]It was like, I mean, you could at least get away.
[138:02.40]You can't get away from this motherfucker.
[138:05.12]This motherfucker is so awful.
[138:08.02]You can't get away from this.
[138:11.51]And if you get hit, she just heals back to full fucking health.
[138:19.18]This makes old Redan look like a children's coloring book.
[138:25.46]This boss is in the wrong game.
[138:32.86]I get it, like, oh, I've never lost a battle.
[138:34.60]I'm undefeated.
[138:36.54]FromSoftware, you don't have to make that actually real.
[138:39.04]Just put it in a fucking note somewhere.
[138:41.92]Put it in a tag.
[138:43.34]Have a helmet you pick up.
[138:44.36]Be like, oh, by the way, Millennium was really good and she lost not that much.
[138:48.67]Don't make it real!
[139:11.82]Oh my god!
[139:13.10]Fuck!
[139:13.92]No, don't drink that potion!
[139:15.60]She's got full fucking health again!
[139:20.73]I can't, man.
[139:21.83]I'm about to summon fucking five of you.
[139:23.71]And I don't even care.
[139:27.45]Do I really need the accolade that I lost like 15% of my hair?
[139:30.78]I don't give a shit.
[139:32.96]Who cares?
[139:34.54]What the?
[139:35.16]I don't give a fuck.
[139:45.99]Oh, Xbox achievement.
[139:47.11]25% hair loss.
[139:47.55]Oh, shit.
[139:47.77]Oh, fuck.
[139:47.95]Oh, what the fuck?
[139:48.36]Oh, shit.
[140:18.30]so
[141:31.69]Dude, last boss in Sekiro, I could like reliably like play against.
[141:39.34]I think they just mashed, I think they just put every slider to 100.
[141:44.82]Just said, fuck it, let's just see what happens.
[141:50.56]At FromSoftware, they were like, just take every single slider and just put it to 100.
[141:53.56]And just see what happens.
[141:54.52]Just see what happens to the world.
[141:56.84]Some, like, world event.
[141:59.06]Yeah, just, like, put it all at 100.
[142:00.40]Max everything out.
[142:01.10]Who cares?
[142:01.70]And let's see what the internet says.
[142:02.82]And oh, we're talking!
[142:05.16]They don't even give you... When you drink...
[142:28.44]Please stop doing that!
[142:33.16]He's too upset to focus.
[142:34.18]There is no focusing!
[142:35.54]Just get lucky!
[142:38.26]Or sit here for 50 hours and fucking just grind this until you burn it into your fucking frontal cortex to understand.
[142:47.29]I'm so mad.
[142:53.23]I've played almost- I've played every single boss in this whole game.
[142:58.78]And let me tell you something.
[143:00.94]This is the worst thing they've ever done.
[143:06.17]Even that dumbass dragon in Dark Souls 3 was better than this.
[143:10.43]That stupid huge dragon with 500 million health was at least, like, was like, okay, just kill me fucking instantly.
[143:19.36]That shit didn't happen.
[143:22.37]No, Koss was not even close.
[143:24.57]Koss had so much... No.
[143:25.90]There was so much intel on Koss.
[143:27.96]Koss was a walk in the park in comparison.
[143:30.06]There was so much intel on Koss.
[143:34.36]Koss took forever to do anything.
[143:36.46]The reason why Koss was annoying was because he went... With every fucking move that he did.
[143:42.31]You could dodge Koss pretty easily with the intel.
[143:45.43]Just running in circles.
[143:47.07]Bomb up!
[144:03.65]Okay.
[144:29.07]I thought you said dodge through the second one!
[144:33.43]Fuck you!
[144:34.25]Oh my god!
[144:35.45]Was I too far away?
[144:39.72]Fuck!
[144:45.22]I think running is just the... honestly, like, the most reliable way to... It's so hard to perfect dodge, like, 16 things in a row!
[145:05.62]Oh, god damn it.
[145:06.72]Fuck off.
[145:07.57]Gotta stamina.
[145:09.63]What the fuck are you doing?
[145:18.47]Fuck.
[145:45.48]Oh god, she's gonna fucking heal everything now.
[145:59.45]Oh god.
[146:17.20]Combo just hit her.
[146:23.88]Oh, shit!
[146:24.80]Come on!
[146:28.55]I tried to fucking dodge through it, man.
[146:30.29]It's just so precise.
[146:31.55]It's so awful.
[146:34.27]So awful!
[146:35.81]It's so awful!
[146:40.80]It's so awful.
[146:44.94]I'm so fucking dead.
[147:04.89]Thank you.
[147:34.59]Are you?
[147:54.68]No!
[147:55.83]No, God, I can't!
[147:58.51]I can't!
[147:59.93]I can!
[148:00.65]I can't!
[148:12.58]I don't know what you're fucking doing.
[148:50.81]Oh shit.
[149:37.58]This is unbearable, dude.
[149:40.82]Am I eating the poison?
[149:42.71]Because I don't have any flasks.
[149:47.19]This is horrendous.
[149:50.71]I didn't have any flasks left.
[149:52.17]That's heals.
[149:53.31]I had to try to get at least some health.
[149:55.83]Guys, do you think I really give a shit of my health bar going like this?
[150:01.00]When she can take this much health in one second.
[150:08.83]Don't make fun of my fucking big fingernails.
[150:10.73]They give me strength.
[150:14.28]Weapon stagger.
[150:14.92]You guys.
[150:15.58]Okay.
[150:16.74]It's really easy to sit there and be like.
[150:19.76]Do you understand that?
[150:21.88]This is the most unbearable thing they've ever made.
[150:24.36]Ever.
[150:25.32]I'm trying.
[150:26.32]Don't you get it?
[150:55.50]Just out of fucking stamina, man.
[150:56.86]You have to move so many times!
[151:00.06]You have to move so much more than she does.
[151:03.10]It's holy shit.
[151:03.84]How the fuck do they expect people to actually reliably do this fucking stupid ass fight?
[151:07.49]Holy fuck.
[151:14.77]I fucking hate this game.
[151:17.20]This is two.
[151:18.56]This fight brought this game down to a one and a half.
[151:22.75]I don't even want this game to come free in the cereal box anymore.
[151:25.13]You understand?
[151:25.91]That's how awful this is.
[151:26.95]This is a two.
[151:28.77]Two out of, uh, two.
[151:30.31]Two out of six.
[151:31.01]I don't even want this in the free in the cereal box anymore.
[151:40.51]How much?
[151:40.77]I'm trying to get her to bleed.
[151:45.69]I just want to see what the bleed damage looks like.
[151:47.29]But it won't fucking proc!
[151:51.93]I give it a 2.6 GPA.
[151:54.65]Like, bleed.
[151:55.59]Okay, that does a lot, but holy shit, you have to hit her so many times.
[151:58.74]And she's gonna get it all back, because nobody's perfect.
[152:00.84]Not you!
[152:01.72]Not even you!
[152:02.74]Stop pretending like you did this perfectly, by the way.
[152:20.57]Nope.
[152:21.15]No way.
[152:36.66]It's close to the mimic tier.
[152:37.84]We're getting close to the mimic tier.
[152:39.12]We are.
[152:41.36]What?
[152:41.50]Like, I'm level 145.
[152:41.86]What the fuck?
[152:42.22]How are you supposed to do this?
[152:52.90]What the fuck are you talking about?
[153:05.03]Phase 2 shit, man.
[153:06.25]Like, you have to fight her... You have to fight, like, three or four health bars worth if she fucking heals off of anything.
[153:29.64]I couldn't get up there in fucking time!
[153:32.14]Oh my god!
[153:39.25]I wonder how many people in chat here summoned a friend to beat this.
[153:42.87]And they're all sitting here and talking all this.
[153:46.05]And they probably summoned three friends to beat this.
[153:49.57]And they're sitting here, Pepe laughing at me.
[153:51.55]And you fucking people here definitely summoned two of your friends.
[153:56.55]I'm telling you.
[153:57.45]I'd love to see.
[153:58.03]I want to see your game files.
[153:59.45]Show me the game files.
[154:00.71]Show me the game files, okay?
[154:02.49]You beat this blood of summoning.
[154:09.23]Show me the file.
[154:12.30]I want an Nvidia Shadow Play of you beating this by yourself for the first time.
[154:18.18]I want to see the documentation.
[154:20.04]I want you to use the power of friendship.
[154:28.58]Dude, for the one person in chat here that beat this without fucking summoning people, you right now, you are just like, you have huge balls.
[154:36.20]You know what I mean?
[154:38.58]That's great.
[154:39.84]That's awesome.
[154:40.84]It must be fucking annoying, right?
[154:42.74]But like, okay, some of us people here can't do this shit.
[154:46.16]You know what I mean?
[154:53.60]And you get to have that forever.
[154:55.13]You know, oh yeah, uh, Malenia?
[154:56.67]Yeah, that fight was wicked fucking hard, kid.
[154:58.83]But, I mean, I beat it, like, on my fourth try.
[155:00.91]And it's like, okay, dude, cool, that's awesome, man.
[155:03.73]But, like, you must be, you are an alien.
[155:05.67]You're a fucking alien from outer space.
[155:08.69]You're an alien.
[155:10.15]When you were dropped off here in a spaceship and you have, like, a 10% higher intelligence than everybody else on Earth.
[155:38.68]Use Millenia's Shackle.
[155:39.86]That item doesn't exist.
[155:44.55]We're gonna relax.
[155:46.79]I mean, I got it a halfway at Phase 2 before.
[155:50.51]Let's just do what we were doing before.
[155:52.55]The reliable thing we were doing.
[155:54.25]I'm getting better.
[155:56.42]I'm getting better.
[155:57.92]I'm getting better.
[155:59.88]I'm not gonna listen to these negative Andes in the chat that are telling me that I can't do it.
[156:06.52]None of these negative Andes are gonna get me down.
[156:26.08]Alright, there's a shield that blocks... I need to... I'm gonna put a shield on.
[156:29.87]I'm gonna put a huge fucking shield on.
[156:32.69]I'm gonna put a giant... What's the biggest shield in the game?
[156:34.67]And I'm just gonna... Just put it on.
[156:35.99]And hold it with two hands.
[156:37.71]What's my favorite kind of dessert?
[156:38.67]Tiramisu.
[156:56.75]Okay.
[156:59.63]Can't hold any of these.
[157:02.55]These are 100 physical, though.
[157:05.44]Okay, here we go.
[157:12.00]Does it matter if it's on... How do I block?
[157:17.35]Why can't I fucking block like this?
[157:19.01]God damn it.
[157:19.71]I thought...
[157:25.78]Just fucking kill me already.
[157:26.92]God damn it, man.
[157:27.86]We just find like a glitch or something.
[157:35.11]I'm gonna get stuck in the wall and it's gonna fucking kill her.
[157:36.97]She's gonna go like walk through and die.
[157:49.88]Come on.
[157:50.56]Let me find some scrap.
[157:55.32]I'm going to clip into the fucking wall and she's going to follow me and die.
[158:15.84]I got to fix this.
[158:16.34]Just kill me.
[158:16.80]I don't know.
[158:17.52]I love how it takes you forever to kill me when I'm just standing around.
[158:31.49]Use the Lie Down emote.
[158:35.00]Try to parry her.
[158:58.13]Don't drink a potion, you idiot.
[159:00.72]You idiot.
[159:05.22]I need to see.
[159:06.68]We're just testing.
[159:09.60]I want to test and see if I can eat that whole whirlwind move.
[159:13.69]Whatever it is. ...
[159:35.45]God damn it, man.
[159:36.58]I hate this.
[159:41.50]This is the most I've ever struggled on FromSoftware, boss.
[159:44.36]I'm telling you, without a doubt.
[159:45.42]Like, nothing comes close.
[159:48.60]And I have 5,000 hours in all the FromSoftware games, and let me tell you something, Reddit.
[159:53.07]Right?
[159:53.49]Like, yeah, I know.
[159:54.45]I've seen it.
[159:55.35]I've seen it.
[159:55.89]I've heard about it.
[160:03.58]I just want to see if I can block this.
[160:04.72]This is just a wash.
[160:05.34]This is a test.
[160:12.22]Just do it so I can just see if this is worth doing.
[160:22.41]Go up and please.
[160:51.80]Please, just let me see if I can block the move!
[160:54.44]Why won't you fucking do it?
[161:01.49]Go in the air!
[161:05.26]I have a fucking flask already.
[161:10.64]Six mana flask?
[161:11.64]I didn't... I... Dude, we've been trying so many strategies to beat this stupid-ass boss.
[161:15.59]Am I actually gonna be one of these streamers that sits here for like ten fucking hours to do this?
[161:23.77]Like, oh yeah, it took me eight hours of two straight streams to beat her.
[161:33.35]Alright, go in the fucking air!
[161:34.94]Okay, you can block the first one.
[161:46.55]With that, who cares?
[161:47.11]It doesn't matter.
[161:47.49]You're gonna get by the next two.
[162:04.52]Ooh, the power stands on the katana?
[162:12.93]What about Blackknife Tish?
[162:15.71]Do I have enough... Do I have... Whatever they are?
[162:19.27]Do I have enough warts for that?
[162:23.44]Summon your friend.
[162:27.50]Is Tish actually good here?
[162:36.37]This is just so much fun.
[162:37.95]Just so much.
[162:44.76]Black Knight Teach will help a ton.
[162:45.76]I gotta do something.
[162:50.08]But it can't be the Mimic tier yet.
[162:51.38]The Mimic tier is like, I'm going to turn on the game show.
[162:55.16]I don't want to do that yet.
[162:56.88]But trust me when I say, I'm willing to.
[163:06.01]Oh, stop.
[163:06.71]This is bullshit.
[163:44.28]I didn't want to drink that.
[163:45.00]I'm okay.
[163:55.72]I can't see anything!
[164:07.44]Oh, come on!
[164:07.80]You're doing it again!
[164:09.63]I can't hold him.
[164:10.71]I can't hold him.
[164:11.53]I can't hold him.
[164:12.93]I can't block him when he does that.
[164:15.41]Oh!
[164:15.55]Oh!
[164:37.04]I'm trying to parry.
[164:50.31]The end of this video is going to be opening up the trash can and dropping the Elden Ring disk case into the trash.
[164:59.31]Boom.
[165:01.57]Plus like for more.
[165:12.52]Get rid of this fucking thing.
[165:30.33]These things are plus seven, dude.
[165:31.77]Alright, I'm gonna try this one more- ugh.
[165:46.75]Where's Tish?
[165:50.72]I don't think I do- I don't even have Tish.
[166:06.57]I don't have it.
[166:12.67]The jail?
[166:17.85]Oh, it's a jail.
[166:18.49]Alright.
[166:18.81]Let's go do it.
[166:20.10]I ain't fucking putting up with this anymore.
[166:22.36]I don't care.
[166:23.04]I'm not doing it.
[166:26.08]I don't care.
[166:26.70]Whatever.
[166:27.00]I'll summon Tish and win.
[166:30.96]I don't give a shit.
[166:31.84]Who cares?
[166:32.80]It's just pixels on the screen.
[166:34.29]You know what I mean?
[166:34.73]It's just like pixels that have been mushed together to look like an image.
[166:38.09]Well, I don't care.
[166:40.05]Where?
[166:40.25]An area.
[166:43.71]Yeah.
[166:51.55]This one here?
[166:52.41]Is that it?
[166:54.03]No.
[166:54.35]Is that one?
[167:00.51]No.
[167:02.49]No.
[167:04.46]Is it right here?
[167:04.90]Right here.
[167:11.46]This one?
[167:16.90]Southwest.
[167:19.93]Right here?
[167:20.57]Okay, right here.
[167:38.46]Alright, we need to go to one.
[167:39.52]Let's go.
[167:44.02]Oh my god, he's going to use Tish.
[167:45.16]You know, for the last couple of days, I was thinking like, oh, fuck.
[167:48.28]Maybe I'm going to try to beat this.
[167:49.26]I beat, like, the last boss in Sekiro.
[167:51.42]And, like, I streamed it.
[167:52.10]And I didn't, like, get, like, help or anything.
[167:53.61]And I did it.
[167:55.71]After seeing this for the last, like, four hours or so, game-wise.
[167:59.05]No, I don't fucking care.
[168:02.40]If I could summon a giant Omega Lull that just came and just bit her head off and just killed her instantly, I would do it and everyone would be like, oh my god, he used the giant Omega Lull.
[168:12.65]And I'd be like, I don't care.
[168:13.77]Yeah, I did.
[168:14.37]Good.
[168:14.97]Who cares?
[168:19.19]I don't care.
[168:19.71]I was about to be so angry.
[168:30.33]Use the Mimic Tear.
[168:31.11]The Mimic Tear is worse than the Omega Lull.
[168:43.37]You'd puke.
[168:52.98]Mimic Tear is not an instant win.
[168:54.08]I know, I'm just kidding around.
[168:55.68]Alright, where are you?
[168:56.54]Let's go.
[169:19.87]What the fuck's that?
[169:35.52]Oh, that's slow.
[169:46.31]That's a lot of damage.
[170:20.66]so
[170:54.40]Shit!
[170:57.08]Huh?
[170:58.32]What killed me?
[170:58.78]What happened?
[170:59.60]What happened?
[170:59.88]What happened?
[171:00.16]What happened?
[171:04.86]What happened?
[171:05.32]There's a dot?
[171:06.86]Oh, fuck it.
[171:07.40]I thought it was just like magical juice.
[171:08.50]I didn't think it was a dot.
[171:13.96]This is hard too.
[171:32.38]This thing is in Lunaria?
[171:34.63]Holy shit dude.
[171:37.11]Fuck you.
[171:53.10]You can jump over it.
[171:59.71]Or maybe not.
[172:25.12]That hurts a lot.
[172:51.62]Whoa!
[172:53.04]Got caught!
[173:03.03]Drink!
[173:03.41]Why the fuck?
[173:04.13]What's the input bullshit?
[173:23.18]Alright, that was good.
[173:32.23]80,000 souls, holy shit.
[173:38.53]Okay.
[173:49.80]I got- you got the Omega Lull spell.
[173:54.42]How dare you.
[173:57.22]What's wrong with you?
[173:57.94]Okay.
[174:20.79]I don't use Comma to Zora.
[174:21.81]Comma to Zora does not hurt her really at all.
[174:25.07]I did it on the Phase 2 transition, and it was like, I held it on there for five full seconds, and it was not worth doing.
[174:40.28]Okay.
[174:41.12]Where are you?
[174:43.36]Blackknife?
[174:44.06]Tish.
[174:44.54]Tish.
[174:50.93]I can buy those.
[174:51.41]You should do rivers of blood while you're here.
[175:02.58]Are there any more bell burns?
[175:16.22]Yeah, I need ghost glove wart five.
[175:20.62]Hey, do I need six?
[175:29.01]Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[175:32.25]Let's go.
[175:34.65]Not the right build for Rivers of Blood?
[175:42.72]You gotta respec.
[175:43.38]It won't work on an in-build.
[175:44.90]Let's give this another, like, hour.
[175:47.20]We got Tish.
[175:48.22]I've heard this is the Omega Lull Bite Malenia's head off person.
[175:53.21]We're gonna do it.
[175:55.07]Arcane and Dex.
[175:56.21]But that's, like, the whole nother character.
[175:58.37]I have a plus 10 Tish.
[176:10.29]I'm ready to fuck around.
[176:11.51]I'm ready to fuck somebody up.
[176:22.58]132 mana.
[176:22.76]Holy shit.
[176:23.46]Alright.
[176:30.86]Mambo.
[176:32.82]Actually, it was really good.
[176:33.78]Everybody loves Mambo.
[176:34.82]How could you not?
[176:37.18]I'm sorry I have to put Game Genie in Mambo.
[176:55.15]Okay, let's see what happens here.
[177:00.66]Disrespecting best girl with cheese Andy scratch.
[177:03.10]Shaking my head.
[177:03.78]I don't care.
[177:04.22]Alright, get her!
[177:09.72]I don't have to do anything!
[177:17.44]Let's just kill her!
[177:20.36]Holy shit, that was insane!
[177:23.62]Oh, what was that heal?
[177:26.12]Oh my god, teach!
[177:34.56]Why are you healing so much more?
[177:35.84]Alright, you got a dot on you now.
[177:45.85]That should never do that much damage.
[177:47.25]I don't care how strong the boss is.
[177:48.61]That's fucked up, man.
[177:49.79]Don't you think that's fucked up?
[177:54.21]She did one slash and it just took 90% of my health.
[178:06.71]Yeah!
[178:17.54]Oh my goodness.
[178:23.87]Come on, Garrett.
[178:24.65]Geez, Andy.
[178:27.33]Oh, cry out the macaroni and cheese.
[178:46.96]How did you miss that?
[178:55.40]God, you should never do that much damage.
[179:10.32]Oh, it's that cheesy, rainy, brownie.
[179:11.92]Oh.
[179:30.41]I hate this fight.
[179:34.71]I just want to get out of this fight.
[179:36.74]You know what I mean?
[179:37.42]I'm going to go to my game files.
[179:40.66]Where it says, Millenia dead.
[179:42.86]Dash.

[179:45.00]Exclamation point.

[179:47.08]True.
[179:47.76]Quotes.
[179:49.04]And bracket.
[179:49.76]You know what I mean?
[179:50.60]I'm just going to put it in there.
[180:07.44]No, not Mambo!
[180:08.56]Fuuuuck!
[180:13.84]Mambo, prove everybody wrong.
[180:30.27]Juice?
[180:30.79]What?
[180:30.97]How am I out of juice already?
[180:57.37]He's just farming, like he's just being farmed.
[181:17.34]I just can't, man.
[181:42.89]I'm just so done with this bullshit.
[181:46.89]Oh my god, I'm fucking dead.
[181:48.72]I need you too.
[182:24.84]off with that FromSoftware what is with this code oh my god you gotta be fucking kidding me dude I can't fucking believe that move like you can't you guys put a training dummy on the ground that just like absorbs threat
[182:54.59]All that work gone in one move.
[182:56.25]Isn't it, isn't it fun?
[183:00.30]Isn't it, isn't it, aren't you, isn't it fun?
[183:03.38]For you to spend all this time fighting this fucking goddamn motherfucker down here.
[183:10.38]It's all wiped away.
[183:13.30]She has the stupidest move ever across every single video game.
[183:22.07]Every single one.
[183:24.28]every single video game and I'm even talking about the holy hand grenade from worms armageddon so
[183:53.92]Oh, you should have gotten staggered.
[184:03.49]It's so hard.
[184:04.05]Do you understand how hard it is to dodge that?
[184:05.60]Because when you dodge, the camera fucking goes crazy.
[184:10.26]Sometimes you dodge like the wrong way because you move so quickly.
[184:13.56]I'm not going over there.
[184:15.65]Fuck that.
[184:37.85]I actually can't believe that's in the game.
[184:44.00]I was out of stamina.
[184:44.74]I couldn't run.
[184:45.22]I couldn't run!
[184:47.46]I was too busy playing the game!
[185:05.66]Right now, like, the FromSoftware devs are watching the stream.
[185:08.13]They're watching the stream right now.
[185:09.81]And they're going like... Oh, shoot.
[185:13.19]Here he goes again.
[185:14.51]Oh, that move that we turned up to 100 and fucking 100 times too?
[185:17.79]Just watch, watch, watch him.
[185:18.71]Watch him.
[185:18.95]He's going to lose again.
[185:20.93]Yeah, idiot.
[185:21.43]Idiot.
[185:22.37]Idiot.
[185:40.16]Oh my fucking god, he just never prepared for it.
[185:53.62]Oh my god.
[185:59.75]No!
[186:07.81]What the fuck was that?
[186:09.98]What just happened?
[186:10.64]You just like did a full 100, 300, 80, this fucking 360, RETURN!
[186:25.92]Just fucking run!
[186:26.94]Just run away!
[186:33.11]Look at her health again.
[186:35.27]The healing is fucking so- What is the- What's the fucking magical lore reason for her heal?
[186:43.14]Let's go read the description.
[186:58.43]so so so
[187:25.61]Am I in the rot?
[187:26.57]Fuck you, I am.
[187:31.16]Fuck it, let's go!
[187:31.86]Fuck it, just do it, do it!
[187:36.08]No!
[187:38.22]Oh my god, please don't do it!
[187:40.94]Fuck!
[187:46.20]Get away from me, please!
[187:47.22]Teesh, do something!
[187:48.94]Teesh, do something!
[187:53.82]I fucking ran out of stamina, man!
[187:55.42]I have no stamina!
[187:57.68]I have no stamina!
[187:59.38]I have no stamina!
[188:02.92]Oh my god!
[188:03.99]Oh my fucking god, dude!
[188:16.20]How the fuck are you supposed to do this in a second phase?
[188:20.06]She's got full health!
[188:23.08]I can't- The stamina kicked down.
[188:25.00]I can't even attack her!
[188:26.80]I can't even- She's gonna kill me!
[188:27.90]She's gonna sneeze in one direction and I'm gonna die!
[188:30.51]This sucks!
[188:32.53]I'm dead!
[188:34.05]I'm just fucking screwed!
[188:38.85]Ugh.
[188:43.23]Okay, she shouldn't be able to heal in phase two, right?
[188:46.25]That's not fair.
[188:48.83]Relocate flasks.
[188:54.23]How many health flasks?
[188:55.33]I don't know, man.
[188:57.69]This seems like fucking crazy.
[189:02.53]Maybe like nine?
[189:03.33]How about the boys?
[189:06.73]The boys are going to fill her health bar five times.
[189:13.47]What about your armor?
[189:14.49]I feel like I'm wearing some of the best armor in the game.
[189:24.06]You need to cheese harder.
[189:25.18]How?
[189:25.70]How?
[189:26.76]Where's the ultimate cheese move?
[189:31.67]Just summon people and spam moons.
[189:38.91]All the people saying, get good.
[189:40.77]I want to see your fucking clocked game time on this fight.
[189:45.55]And no, I'm sorry.
[189:46.71]If you came in here at soul level 500, that's not what I'm talking about.
[190:28.64]Why does dude twice the fucking like delayed input shit?
[190:33.07]I don't want to fucking do that.
[190:34.45]I want to I don't want to do I didn't want to do that move again.
[190:40.34]t-shirts under ones please oh my god this is it this is the one this is the one this is the one
[191:06.62]He's just got full fucking health, boys and girls.
[191:13.92]No.
[191:14.30]No.
[191:37.31]Fuck!
[191:38.11]No way!
[191:39.19]That's so insane!
[191:47.00]That's just like... What the fuck are you supposed to do?
[191:51.84]If you're... Okay, I understand.
[191:53.02]Jess, run.
[191:54.12]But Jess, run, bro!
[191:56.79]Run!
[191:57.77]What if you're already there?
[192:01.39]Like, when you... If you're already there, if she goes in the air like that, it's like, you're fucked!
[192:06.66]The timings, it's like one, two, three, four, five, six!
[192:10.81]It's just like holy shit in my face.
[192:19.53]Get the Bloodhound step.
[192:21.46]Do I have to seriously just go get every overpowered fucking move in the whole game to beat a boss?
[192:27.48]In the whole, just give yourself an arm cannon, a Mega Man Legends fucking eyepiece.
[192:34.39]By the way, go get the promoted Captain Morgan fucking handle of alcohol.
[192:39.55]You drink that.
[192:40.19]You shouldn't have to do all that shit.
[192:51.89]The fucking moon.
[192:52.69]It's right in front of you.
[192:53.99]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[193:04.30]Just kill me.
[193:05.27]I don't even care.
[193:13.17]Tisha's player one.
[193:14.13]Good.
[193:14.63]Good.
[193:14.81]I hope you do.
[193:15.37]I hope you beat it, Tisha.
[193:16.69]Please beat the game for me.
[193:18.19]Just beat it for me.
[193:19.15]I don't want to suck.
[193:19.87]Because if I summon somebody, that's extra embarrassing, right?
[193:22.90]Quote.
[193:23.32]In quotes.
[193:23.94]It's extra.
[193:24.50]You can't summon somebody, Joe.
[193:25.66]It's embarrassing.
[193:26.42]You beat Sekiro.
[193:27.12]Last boss.
[193:27.62]First try.
[193:28.24]Oh, we like to jump.
[193:33.10]We're dead.
[193:41.28]That's impossible.
[193:42.36]That's impossible to do that reliably.
[193:43.82]You can't do that reliably.
[193:44.66]It's impossible.
[193:46.62]I just only did that because I turned into Tigger.
[193:48.86]That's the only reason why I did that.
[193:56.03]Okay.
[194:13.76]This is stupid, but it's going to work.
[194:18.39]This is really stupid.
[194:20.25]This is stupid.
[194:21.01]Turn around.
[194:21.49]Teach help.
[194:21.87]Turn around.
[194:50.56]It's impossible man
[195:07.59]Like, they come up at such weird timings, and they go across the whole game.
[195:13.00]It's like, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, stab, stab, stab!
[195:17.44]It's like, you gotta, fuck, are you supposed to do this?
[195:22.99]The tuning on this fight is like, holy fuck, they broke off the volume.
[195:27.37]All they broke, this goes to 11.
[195:28.47]It goes to 11.
[195:29.63]It goes to 11.
[195:37.40]roll to the right dude what do you think I was doing are you shitting me I was what the fuck just dodge oh I I can't even take it seriously anymore I know I got missed the move oh whatever
[195:56.25]Oops-a-daisy.
[195:59.33]Oh, the brilliant minds that brought you fucking Sekiro in Dark Souls.
[196:04.68]Comes the fight of a lifetime.
[196:07.86]Malenia.
[196:09.96]Some call it... She's never lost.
[196:12.09]Yeah.
[196:12.73]Oh, yeah.
[196:13.83]I have no insults.
[196:14.57]I'm just angry.
[196:18.59]I was gonna just go off, but like, you know what?
[196:21.35]No, I'm not gonna.
[196:22.07]I'm not gonna go off.
[196:22.91]I'm not gonna be the guy that everybody points to as the streamer that like is a fucking weirdo.
[196:28.15]I'm just gonna play.
[196:29.31]And I'm gonna dodge this perfectly once.
[196:33.16]I'm actually pissed that I didn't get that input.
[196:35.64]Dodge one second later.
[196:36.88]I can play on an Xbox 360 sometimes.
[196:42.52]Like the input lag is like a full second sometimes.
[197:00.49]don't let her do any moves either she goes in the air killer do it quick before she gets it
[197:13.94]so so
[197:58.15]Doesn't that look as if her back was turned?
[198:05.35]No, I need that person to fight for the rest of the game.
[198:18.48]What the?
[198:18.78]What is that?
[198:23.94]Help!
[198:24.20]Help, Teach!
[198:24.58]Help!
[198:37.97]I thought she was doing the other one I Thought she was doing guys I
[199:00.58]I thought she was doing another move.
[199:01.82]I thought that was the big sweeping one.
[199:03.86]Oh, my God.
[199:05.36]Fuck this fight.
[199:07.22]Fuck this game.
[199:08.28]Return it.
[199:08.75]I know I have 100 hours in it, but I'm returning it.
[199:11.51]I'm going up to the counter with these eyes like this.
[199:13.89]The fucking GameStop that I got this piece of shit from.
[199:16.61]I'm going to be like, hey, yeah, I would like to make a return, please.
[199:22.02]Oh, yeah, you want to make a return?
[199:23.08]It's been, uh, I know that, like, your policy is seven days.
[199:27.27]Uh, it's been 38.
[199:29.23]But I want a refund.
[199:30.25]No, this is, Malenia sucks, and your game sucks.
[199:33.67]It's like, the guys at GameStop had nothing to do with this game.
[199:52.05]Ugh!
[200:19.62]Fuck.
[200:58.55]dish dish dish dish dish dish dish dish dish dish come on dish dish dish dish dish dish
[201:14.36]Thank you.
[201:47.39]Thank you.
[202:32.07]No!
[202:35.93]No!
[202:49.20]Tisha, I don't know where you are, but I need you to slide!
[203:04.18]You should've just taken a drone and just lost it!
[203:40.99]What happened?
[203:41.35]Why didn't she not move?
[203:42.17]That was weird!
[204:15.92]No!
[204:36.74]She had to fucking do that move right there!
[204:41.26]Oh my god, you had to do that right there?
[204:44.20]Do you see what I mean?
[204:47.68]It's like if you're within like 5 to 10 feet of her, you're just fucked.
[204:51.68]Ugh.
[204:55.98]Ugh, why?
[204:58.04]Ugh, why?
[205:01.28]Why?
[205:01.36]Ugh, the scarlet rot killed me, but fuck man, this sucks such dick!
[205:14.42]This sucks!
[205:37.60]I can't believe she did that fucking move.
[205:40.44]Of all the things.
[205:42.08]It's just like, come the fuck on.
[205:44.32]And I was so, I was right next to her too.
[205:48.13]That's the worst part.
[205:50.85]Oh, you pain in the ass.
[205:56.37]Here we go, I'm dead.
[206:02.00]I can't believe that fucking move is in the air.
[206:06.12]Like, that move existing just fucking ruins the fight sometimes.
[206:09.53]Like, it just does.
[206:10.45]It just ruins the fight.
[206:14.69]That fucking move existing just throws... You just... It fucking just shreds... It just throws the whole run into the air.
[206:21.66]That's what makes the fight fun.
[206:31.62]I don't like going to the dentist, do you?
[206:34.02]The dentist sucks.
[206:35.56]The dentist is not fun.
[206:36.64]Do you not go to the dentist chair and go like, yeah, I'm ready.
[206:40.36]I can't wait for you to drill in.
[206:41.81]I'm not going to say it.
[206:55.60]I was so fucking close.
[206:56.72]It was one fucking hit away, but she healed off of the stupid dance thing that she does.
[207:02.65]She healed like 20% of her fucking health pool off of the summon.
[207:09.56]This sucks.
[207:13.52]I can't wait to be done with this.
[207:14.50]I'm gonna do it, and I'm not doing this on MiiStrong.
[207:17.60]MiiStrong's just gonna get high and fucking enjoy his life.
[207:20.08]He's not coming in here.
[207:20.90]I don't give a shit about the secret fucking ending.
[207:23.78]MiiStrong's gonna just suck a fucking ball.
[207:28.10]He's gonna just, whatever the term that the fucking kids use.
[207:31.94]He's coming in here, and he's literally not coming in this door.
[207:34.82]I don't give a shit how cool this is.
[207:37.44]No, and it's not even cool.
[207:39.19]It's not even that cool.
[207:40.01]This fight's not cool.
[207:41.81]Lee Strong is gonna get wicked high and he's gonna walk around Limgrave.
[207:44.55]That's it.
[207:54.90]I'm looking forward to that.
[207:55.76]I'm just looking forward to, like, going to Limgrave and, like, fucking just, like, spelling the ocean and shit.
[207:59.70]I don't want to be here.
[208:10.32]god you fucking seriously god damn it man if I'm trying not to lock on that move breaks this whole encounter it's a broken fucking move it is broken it's a it's broken it needs to be corrected they need to get in there and they need to correct the mistake it is a mistake it is a mistake why are there so many people here
[208:49.39]I need to just relax.
[208:50.23]It's like, people like to tell them they have fucking friends and shit.
[208:55.49]Don't tell people to come here.
[208:57.39]Don't tell people to come here.
[208:59.23]Why do I not have access to teach?
[209:01.05]I fucking hate this.
[209:03.25]You guys are fucking kidding me.
[209:05.35]I'm doing it with my original friend.
[209:08.72]I'm fucking... I have no theories right now.
[209:16.98]What is happening?
[209:18.95]Do the magic move.
[209:20.35]Do the magic move.
[209:29.98]What's the glowing shit that she has all over?
[209:31.52]What's going on there?
[209:51.36]Why would I attack Mambo?
[209:52.70]What was the point of that?
[209:53.38]I ain't out of fucking stamina.
[210:06.45]I'm just gonna go put 50 Endurance in after this.
[210:09.49]I'm gonna put 50 Endurance in and 70 Intelligence.
[210:13.12]And that's it.
[210:26.23]This piece of fucking garbage needed one hit.
[210:49.54]You had to do that move out of every move.
[210:52.26]You were dead in one swing, but you are so unbearable that, like, the player base does not even want to fight.
[211:02.72]They are afraid to engage because a few of the moves are disengageable.
[211:08.30]Like, you just disengage the whole fight.
[211:13.45]Nobody wants to fight you.
[211:14.87]You're just annoying.
[211:15.99]You're an annoying piece of shit.
[211:18.93]I'm taking one of these right now.
[211:20.51]I'm taking these fucking rune drugs right now.
[211:22.65]No, I'm not.
[211:23.15]It's a wash.
[211:24.75]Take one now.
[211:25.19]Quick.
[211:32.82]The only reason why everybody fucking does this fight is so they can- it's a vicious cycle, right?
[211:38.97]I need to beat this because everyone's gonna make fun of me if I don't.
[211:41.81]Everybody, all your Discord groups and all your friend groups and shit, all you guys are sitting around going like, fuck, I have to beat her.
[211:47.33]Otherwise, I'm gonna be the one person in the fucking friend group that doesn't beat her.
[211:51.05]And everyone's gonna make fun of me.
[211:53.61]It's a social experiment.
[212:08.20]Fucking social experiment.
[212:10.56]It's a fucking FromSoftware.
[212:12.83]It's a FromSoftware like social mind experiment.
[212:18.59]There were like government officials just sitting there with clipboards watching me right now.
[212:22.57]And they're taking notes about my fucking behavior.
[212:31.04]They've got like microscopes.
[212:33.04]Somebody's watching like this part of my face right here under a microscope.
[212:40.87]Fuck this goddamn encounter.
[212:43.77]Fuck this door and fuck this area.
[212:47.61]Can I change... Can I change... Let me ask you guys a question.
[212:50.93]Can I change my ending?
[212:52.55]Can I burn this fucking tree to the ground?
[212:55.82]Can I go get an extinguisher and can I go put out the Erdtree?
[212:58.94]And can I torch this fucking goddamn tree right now?
[213:01.74]Can I burn this tree?
[213:03.30]Tell me that I... If I can, I want to.
[213:06.47]I want to burn this... This fucking tree.
[213:08.81]I want to burn this place.
[213:10.99]I'm going to go back to the Earth Tree and I'm going to...
[213:31.74]Did my spell even land?
[213:48.20]They have to fix this.
[213:49.28]Can you imagine somebody that doesn't really play FromSoftware games walking in here?
[214:01.00]FromSoftware is going to send millions of people to church.
[214:04.91]Like, you're going to make people go ask God for fucking help here.
[214:10.95]I want to see the uptick in new religion applications after this game came out.
[214:17.22]I want to see how many people went to fucking church.
[214:19.00]Like, went to their local church and was like, you know what, I'm going to try.
[214:26.62]I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but I think it's a good idea.
[214:54.52]Yeah, yeah, bullshit!
[214:55.92]I knew you were gonna do that dumb move.
[215:13.99]What's the meaning of this?
[215:34.10]Oh come on.
[215:40.44]I didn't- I- I did not press R2 a second time.
[215:44.26]I did not press R2 a second time.
[215:46.14]Why did it queue up another fucking R2?
[215:47.91]Why?
[215:52.22]I swear to God, dude, sometimes, like, if you press a button in this game, and you're in mid-animation, the fact that it, like, does that right after... I want a check... checkbox to make that fucking not happen.
[216:09.31]I want, like, a dozen checkboxes for these quality-of-life things.
[216:13.11]Just... Fuck you, but...
[216:45.92]All that healing!
[216:53.23]Did it again.
[216:59.08]Oh, that fucking just free health from that move.
[217:01.18]You don't want... Okay.
[217:03.90]It's like, seriously, I feel like a speedrunner.
[217:06.36]Like, if she does that to the summons, just start the whole thing over.
[217:10.15]You don't want her to do that move to the summon.
[217:11.61]She regains like 30-40% of her health back.
[217:33.96]Oh my god, I'm gonna fucking scream.
[217:39.71]Just kill me.
[217:40.83]It's like I've had to kill her like fucking three times already.
[218:02.75]God damn it, man.
[218:08.34]Look at Tisha's health.
[218:11.00]Just throw dice in the air.
[218:13.24]That's what this whole fucking fight is.
[218:15.78]Just throw a hundred fucking dice into the air.
[218:20.28]Did you get ten sixes?
[218:22.42]Okay, good.
[218:23.10]Congratulations.
[218:23.77]Okay.
[218:41.32]What?
[218:42.36]I fucking dodged.
[219:01.17]Oh fuck No
[219:23.39]Get away from me!
[219:24.29]I was so intensely paying attention to all the fucking moves she was doing that I fucking wasn't ready for that shit.
[219:52.36]oh my god I don't even know where the camera is oh my god
[220:20.15]I needed one more hit to kill her, which means I can do it.
[220:27.98]Oh, I so- I'm- I'm- I'm- One of the words are, like, fucking right here, and I want to just spew them out.
[220:34.20]Oh, I want to, like, I want to say a bunch of shit.
[220:37.54]You have no idea.
[220:38.62]It's taking- It's taking, like, like, stone-level concentration.
[220:42.98]Like, I'm a goddamn stone.
[220:45.02]Not, like, spew out this- this- just- just, uh, talking shit.
[220:49.63]You- Oh, I watched it so bad.
[221:05.70]I gotta bring myself down.
[221:10.59]What you're about to hear is encouragement and praise with cheering applause just for you.
[221:19.18]Acknowledging you for a variety of reasons.
[221:24.52]There's a situation that does not apply to you.
[221:28.35]Just listen.
[221:34.35]So sit back.
[221:36.39]Get ready.
[221:38.85]Here it comes.
[221:46.50]We want to thank you for all your hard work.
[221:54.72]You're the one who steps up and gets things done around here.
[222:01.61]You keep your word, you deliver what you promise, and then you go the extra mile.
[222:11.42]You're doing a great job!
[222:13.82]A great job!
[222:22.38]If anyone asks, we'll tell them.
[222:25.51]A great job!
[222:54.65]Thank you.
[223:25.64]You're probably wondering why we have asked you here today.
[223:31.48]We want to tell you that we have faith in you.
[223:34.63]And we know you can do it.
[223:40.17]We know you've got everything it takes to accomplish whatever your heart desires.
[223:48.33]That dream you're going for?
[223:50.23]That career you want?
[223:52.17]That recognition you're seeking?
[223:54.39]Die, bitch!
[223:55.25]It is yours!
[224:00.55]Just listen.
[224:01.85]Everyone agrees.
[224:07.45]They're on your side.
[224:09.65]We're here for you.
[224:10.97]Hey.
[224:24.49]Why?
[224:26.05]She had no health.
[224:29.45]What the fuck?
[224:31.99]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[224:40.37]I had to heal.
[224:41.53]I had Scarlet Rot.
[224:42.95]All it took was one fucking- if she had hit me with one move.
[224:48.00]Oh my god, this is the worst thing in any video game that's ever come out!
[224:54.72]Without a doubt, it sucks!
[224:56.84]This is pure pain!
[224:58.83]It's just misery!
[225:00.67]This is miserable!
[225:01.93]Miyazaki, look what you're doing to us!
[225:04.45]Why are you doing this to us, Miyazaki?
[225:06.99]Please, get it, let me out!
[225:08.75]Let me out of here, Miyazaki!
[225:10.35]I don't want to do it anymore!
[225:28.34]Dude, I don't get it.
[225:29.29]And I don't think I ever fucking will.
[225:30.47]Is there any rhyme or reason how to dodge that reliably?
[225:34.25]I feel like it's fucking impossible!
[225:38.19]The hitbox is fucking gigantic!
[225:41.99]And she comes at you so fast!
[225:43.77]Like, fuck that move!
[225:45.21]It's fucking terrible!
[225:46.69]It's stupid!
[225:49.03]I can under- okay, I can understand it twice.
[225:51.49]The third fucking time?
[225:52.75]Bro, fuck you!
[225:54.85]And fuck the- and I was gonna say the horse you rode in on?
[225:58.43]Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.
[226:04.55]Alright, should I put the black and white filter back on?
[226:06.91]Now get her!
[226:11.55]And this time, we're not fucking around.
[226:13.89]Put her back on, cheers to you, quick!
[226:16.36]We believe in you!
[226:49.81]Dude, I don't get it.
[226:51.17]I don't understand.
[226:52.11]It's impossible.
[226:57.56]What the fuck?
[227:01.04]You just dodge.
[227:02.96]It's not possible, dude.
[227:06.15]She goes fucking crazy.
[227:19.97]You have to run?
[227:20.80]That's what I'm saying!
[227:21.98]But if, okay, how, how am I supposed to close gaps with having this permanent terrification of like, this piece of shit is just gonna go in the air and just Tasmanian Devil across the whole game for fucking a full 10 seconds!
[227:38.75]What a stupid fucking boss!
[227:44.02]Did anybody playtest this?
[227:46.40]What was the game about to release?
[227:47.50]Ow, my fucking hand.
[227:50.57]Ow.
[227:51.69]Ow, my hand.
[227:52.85]Ow, that fucking hurt a lot.
[227:56.23]Ow.
[227:57.91]Ow.
[228:00.12]My fingers.
[228:01.36]Okay.
[228:02.62]My fingers.
[228:03.18]Alright, that hurt a lot.
[228:05.00]That fucking hurt.
[228:10.46]They were probably up against the fucking release.
[228:13.04]Miyazaki's like, I don't know, man.
[228:14.34]Just fucking release it.
[228:15.70]We'll fix it in a patch.
[228:16.54]It's like fucking six months later. ...
[228:41.89]what I mean like I'm just you're you are if you are fighting this boss right you're like let's let's go let's go over this educationally right if I'm supposed to attack the boss if I'm attacking the boss and she just starts tasmanian deviling homing you across every
[229:07.64]You need to run away from her first two.
[229:09.50]Dude, but that's what I'm saying.
[229:11.26]If you're, like, attacking the boss, and all of a sudden, like, okay, here we go.
[229:16.97]Here she goes.
[229:17.53]It's too late.
[229:18.99]It's already too late.
[229:20.47]It's already too late.
[229:25.01]Unlock the cam.
[229:25.77]Last time I did that, I dodged through the first one, and I didn't even know where the fuck she was.
[229:29.28]Holy shit, man.
[229:34.59]I can't believe she was dead.
[229:40.38]I got her down to one centimeter phase two, three times now.
[229:44.68]Oh my God, this is the worst fucking thing I've ever played.
[229:49.29]Oh my God, and everybody's saying that.
[229:51.11]Don't you, when everybody says the same thing, don't we all agree that it's true?
[229:54.85]When everybody's saying, oh yeah, this is the fucking shittiest thing I've ever done in a video game.
[229:59.77]What is that?
[230:00.51]It's not accurate?
[230:03.53]99.9999.99% of people?
[230:06.13]That's just so many people.
[230:07.05]I feel like I'm fucking like a radio host.
[230:12.99]Spider-Man, when we get those photos of Spider-Man, that's 99.999% of people hate Spider-Man, and that's why I think that they should nerf Spider-Man.
[230:20.59]What am I, turning into J. Jonah fucking Jameson?
[230:40.99]That sucks!
[230:41.56]Look at the health!
[230:42.28]Teach's health now!
[230:43.16]It's just like, fuck you!
[230:44.66]Now Teach is gonna be dead in phase 2 and I'm gonna have to fuck around on my own.
[231:16.68]I... I ran, and I still get hit by it.
[231:20.08]The second she went in the air, I fucking ran away.
[231:21.72]It still hit me.
[231:23.19]I still got fucking hit by it.
[231:56.18]Oh, my God.
[231:56.86]Fuck you.
[231:57.53]Worst goddamn boss.
[232:10.42]Please don't.
[232:16.60]Please just fucking get hit one more time.
[232:18.14]And I'm in such a bad fucking position too.
[232:25.78]You guys wanted me to make my tier list?
[232:27.58]Put this boss at the very bottom.
[232:29.36]Like F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F tier.
[232:34.32]I mean like F, like I want it deleted from the game.
[232:36.66]F tier, like F, worst ever, worst ever.
[232:39.82]And put Hoarah Loux up at S, because that was fun.
[232:42.90]This sucks.
[232:43.75]Hoarah Loux is a fun fight.
[232:45.59]Hoarah Loux is the best, one of the best fights I think I've done in the whole game so far.
[232:48.93]F, you got an F. You got an F.
[232:54.35]so so so so
[233:39.94]Oh my god, it's so fucking slow!
[234:00.19]God, what's he doing there?
[234:34.65]so
[234:54.41]Thank you.
[235:30.82]OH MY GOD!
[235:31.62]EAT THE POISON THING!
[235:32.90]EAT THE POISON!
[235:33.52]EAT THE POISON!
[235:34.16]EAT THE POISON!
[235:34.79]EAT THE POISON!
[235:46.63]WHAT THE FUCK?!
[235:47.77]WHAT?!
[235:48.97]WHAT?!
[235:49.51]HIT ME!
[235:49.97]It went THAT far!
[235:55.78]It went that fucking far?
[235:59.29]And the rot, dude.
[236:09.74]Use comet.
[236:10.22]Dude, comet sucks dick here.
[236:12.14]Sucks dick!
[236:14.40]Shh, quiet.
[236:14.66]Quiet.
[236:25.73]Don't stand in the floor.
[236:27.61]We got all these game expert handies.
[236:31.27]Game... We got these expert handies.
[236:33.92]Okay.
[236:34.68]I appreciate all the help, everybody.
[236:35.92]I really do.
[236:38.92]I appreciate it.
[236:41.32]I very... I appreciate it.
[236:42.48]I like everyone's trying to help.
[236:46.15]It brought her down to one fucking hit remaining and she does something stupid that covers the whole fucking game world.
[236:55.04]I've done it like four times now and it's just trying to get even remotely close.
[237:01.58]It's just so painful.
[237:03.69]The game just doesn't want you to fight the boss.
[237:07.23]The game is telling you to fight these bosses.
[237:09.77]They don't want you to fight this one.
[237:11.89]They want you to run across the fucking game.
[237:17.30]I don't want it to turn and run.
[237:20.00]Run, run, run, run, run.
[237:22.89]Okay, now, oh, here we go.
[237:24.25]Another run, run, run.
[237:27.15]Run, run.
[237:28.45]Playtest your shit before you put it live!
[237:39.18]Okay.
[237:40.42]So.
[237:44.54]Our place?
[237:44.98]Checking out what happened with our place.
[237:50.54]Just run from the bomb attack?
[237:53.58]Have you played this game?
[237:54.80]I don't think you've played.
[237:55.90]I don't think that person's played the game.
[238:00.49]It's so fucking stupid.
[238:11.71]For what?
[238:12.19]For me to lose hair?
[238:13.61]Who cares?
[238:20.49]But Jerma, go get the one fucking move ability you have to get to fight this boss to make it better.
[238:25.59]You shouldn't have to do 99 Arcane to fight this boss.
[238:29.27]No other boss in the whole game has been like this.
[238:31.07]It's the only one.
[238:31.73]It's the only boss in the whole game that has been like, Oh, dude, what you got to do is you got to respect a 99 Arcane and get the blood move.
[238:39.24]I didn't have to do that with anybody else.
[238:43.00]Fuck this.
[239:18.63]I ran out of fucking stamina.
[239:25.80]I couldn't dodge.
[239:26.95]I would have dodged it.
[239:54.10]No fucking way.
[240:20.90]Oh!
[240:29.64]Give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it,
[240:52.92]They're sucking me up!
[240:55.32]I think my fly was down.
[240:57.24]Oh my god.
[241:33.53]Did I just beat Millenia and show my dick on camera?
[241:36.99]I hope I didn't!
[241:38.35]Please!
[241:39.29]No, I didn't, right?
[241:40.15]I didn't do that!
[241:42.15]No, oh my god, I'm in trouble.
[241:44.19]I think I'm in trouble.
[241:47.27]I actually think I'm in... This fly is open, and I stood up and I like, nothing?
[241:55.62]Oh my god, that was so many emotions in a row.
[241:59.12]I'm wearing fucking, like, pajama pants.
[242:02.42]And these are wide open.
[242:04.56]I mean, yeah, I'm wearing, obviously.
[242:06.92]Oh my god, I thought I was fucked.
[242:11.43]Why is it open?
[242:12.19]They're just pajamas.
[242:13.67]They're just pajamas.
[242:15.89]remember the dream that I had I thought it happened and whatever I was about to just lean into it and whatever I don't know what would have happened to me I would have gotten like banned and I don't know what I would have leaned into it people would I would be like talking about like oh my god we should drive this dick on camera and like whatever whatever okay like I honestly what would I have done I would have been like whatever fine who cares so well you saw it I don't care what I have done
[242:49.15]That was the fucking worst thing ever.
[242:50.87]That was actually the worst thing ever.
[242:54.87]Even with like cheese strats, that was seriously like my teeth were falling out.
[243:05.88]That was the fucking worst.
[243:08.70]Holy shit, that was so bad.
[243:12.77]What a shit show.
[243:15.95]Alright, let me...
[243:20.17]I got so lucky at the end there to be able to just spam like three moons in a row.
[243:25.77]Oh my god.
[243:29.82]We saw a ball.
[243:32.94]Whatever.
[243:35.70]Honestly, what am I going to say?
[243:36.76]If that ever happened?
[243:37.64]If I did that, I'd be like, okay, whatever.
[243:41.89]Oh well.
[243:53.87]What do you guys think?
[243:59.83]That one move ruins the fight, honestly.
[244:01.39]It does.
[244:02.43]It does.
[244:03.27]And I know you'll get it eventually, but I know you could probably dodge it.
[244:07.89]Okay, if you timed anybody out for telling me to dodge those and I was like, ban that person for a day, unban everybody.
[244:13.72]If I'd said that.
[244:15.56]Do endurance.
[244:16.02]30.
[244:16.82]Okay.
[244:27.96]Yes, I have.
[244:28.40]Of course I have underwear on, but it was like, I don't know.
[244:37.44]Well, I'm happy that happened, but we're not done.
[244:39.58]I still have to do the other thing.
[244:43.69]I have to do the last boss.
[244:47.65]So what does that do for me?
[244:50.93]Does that do anything for me?
[244:52.41]Does that open anything up?
[244:56.57]Her rune.
[244:57.97]Oh, right.
[245:00.21]Okay.
[245:01.19]Remembrance of Melenia, goddess of the worst boss in the game and should be deleted from the game and no one would be mad if she was gone.
[245:07.88]Hewn into the Erdtree.
[245:09.70]The power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader.
[245:12.52]Alternatively, if you use it, yeah.
[245:15.10]Miquella and Melenia are both the children of a single god.
[245:19.10]As such, they are both Empyreans, but suffered afflictions from birth.
[245:23.55]One was cursed with eternal childhood.
[245:27.01]And the other harbored rot within.
[245:28.85]Eternal childhood.
[245:35.99]Check the mod chat for the clip.
[245:41.55]Have you guys examined it?
[245:44.87]The mods examined it?
[245:56.55]Okay, the mods have examined it.
[245:58.03]There's no balls we're showing.
[246:05.64]Good.
[246:07.04]So, Eternal Childhood.
[246:08.94]That's weird.
[246:11.51]Cursed with Eternal... Who cursed?
[246:12.69]Okay.
[246:21.01]Very cool.
[246:22.54]So, now let's go to the round table hold.
[246:34.14]Check that great rune.
[246:42.49]Isolated Divine Tower which stands beyond the lost great bridge.
[246:50.19]Stupid-ass boss has a stupid-ass fucking tower.
[246:52.33]Where is it?
[246:54.87]Beyond the great bridge?
[246:55.91]Like up here?
[247:10.95]You need to teleport.
[247:11.83]You already have it.
[247:12.55]Wait, what?
[247:14.42]This one?
[247:16.48]Divine... Where is it?
[247:25.94]Isolate Divine Fowl, which stands beyond the Lost Great Bridge.
[247:31.05]Teleport her at Divine Bridge Grace.
[247:43.71]Uh... Do I not have it anymore?
[247:46.01]Because the capitals... Need to teleport there.
[247:51.09]Go to the South Limgrave and teleport to the trap with the trap chest.
[247:56.31]South Limgrave teleport via... What?
[248:00.66]Oh, yeah.
[248:01.12]Oh, yeah.
[248:01.76]Yeah.
[248:02.62]Yeah.
[248:02.84]Where's that?
[248:04.64]Tower of Return.
[248:05.72]Oh, yeah.
[248:07.76]Yeah.
[248:10.36]Oh, yeah.
[248:11.95]Oh, yeah.
[248:12.47]Yeah.
[248:14.24]Oh yeah!
[248:22.71]Alright.
[248:23.51]Let's tell people I didn't beat it.
[248:27.01]And let everyone be calming me down.
[248:39.67]I know.
[248:48.58]Having a plus, having 15 flasks, having one extra flask is not going to do anything.
[248:53.73]One extra flask is not going to do anything.
[248:57.29]Fucking stupid.
[249:00.17]I really, really like this game up until the last, like, fucking 10 to 20 fucking minutes.
[249:06.09]It's hard and it's fucking just broken and stupid.
[249:08.45]And, like... I'd take a break.
[249:14.72]That's not going to fucking do anything.
[249:19.78]We'll get 99 arcane.
[249:24.64]You shouldn't have to fucking do that.
[249:26.00]I'm just not doing it.
[249:27.88]Not going to summon people.
[249:28.94]No, I don't give a fuck.
[249:30.10]I don't give a fuck.
[249:33.80]I don't give a fuck, okay?
[249:34.94]I don't give a fuck!
[249:39.44]Stop telling me to fucking summon.
[249:41.18]I don't give a fuck.
[249:43.44]I don't give a fuck.
[249:45.85]Stop telling me to do that.
[249:48.91]I never get angry on these streams.
[249:50.05]I really don't.
[249:52.75]But, like, I'm fucking seriously so mad right now.
[249:55.27]I'm never gonna beat it.
[249:55.89]And it sucks because the game is actually really fucking fun besides... It's like an 8 now.
[250:00.85]I give this, like, a fucking 7.9.
[250:01.55]Now you're telling me I have to go all the way to the fucking... You want me to go get this fucking item that's gonna help?
[250:07.89]Shouldn't be like that.
[250:16.65]You that just came in, you're probably really concerned there.
[250:19.59]We got you.
[250:20.89]We got you.
[250:23.51]Yep, we got you.
[250:24.49]I hate myself.
[250:27.29]Okay.
[250:28.25]It's down here.
[250:48.19]Elden Ring.
[250:49.23]Elden Ring.
[250:50.34]Elden Ring.
[250:51.38]Elden Ring.
[250:52.60]Alright, let's start the chant.
[250:54.66]Elden Ring sucks.
[250:55.78]Elden Ring sucks.
[250:56.96]Elden Ring sucks.
[250:58.08]Elden Ring sucks.
[250:59.20]Elden Ring sucks.
[251:00.30]Elden Ring sucks.
[251:01.48]Elden Ring sucks.
[251:08.42]Imagine coming into the stream and just seeing the chat just spamming, Elden Ring sucks.
[251:16.44]It's like, no, it doesn't.
[251:17.62]What?
[251:17.82]Why is everybody hated here?
[251:19.00]Elden Ring sucks.
[251:30.05]That's what makes me feel better.
[251:31.97]Just get everybody to say Elden Ring sucks.
[251:34.75]Yeah, that makes me feel so much better.
[251:36.55]It's like it's midnight.
[251:37.47]Holy shit.
[251:47.32]Next stream you should show us, you should show us crushing watermelons with your thighs.
[251:50.40]Can you imagine if I actually, if I did that?
[251:59.99]Like, oh, today guys, I'm going to crush watermelons with my thighs.
[252:02.74]That would be so stupid.
[252:16.19]What's stopping you?
[252:17.59]Um, a lot of things actually.
[252:19.55]Oh, this thing!
[252:22.63]Wow, that's actually kind of cool.
[252:25.43]So this thing's turned on.
[252:29.28]My eye, my eye, my eye, my eye!
[252:37.58]What the hell?
[252:42.52]So that's how you get... I've looked at this before.
[252:45.70]At least on the map.
[252:46.46]Isolated Divine Tower.
[252:55.75]This guy doesn't even own a watermelon.
[252:59.27]I mean, they're not really in season right now.
[253:13.25]What was that?
[253:17.74]What's that?
[253:18.08]I just like Play-Doh.
[253:26.09]Like the Play-Doh mush things where you push the Play-Doh through the thing.
[253:44.37]I'm not supposed to do this because you'll fall down.
[253:46.03]You'll fall backwards, right?
[254:07.50]What would you do if there was another Millenia at the top of this tower?
[254:14.32]Um... I would probably, uh, turn around and walk away.
[254:19.58]And go fight the last boss.
[254:22.23]That's fucked up.
[254:30.67]Somebody spo- who do you mean who spoiled it?
[254:33.87]Who spoiled it?
[254:34.87]Oh, really?
[254:36.01]Okay.
[254:46.18]Are you guys full of crap?
[254:56.95]You guys are full of shit.
[255:13.98]Whoa.
[255:16.61]You can see Azula from here.
[255:23.64]I thought that Azula existed in a time like outside of reality or something.
[255:29.92]Whoa.
[255:32.49]So what the hell is going on here?
[255:35.83]I thought that Azula existed like somewhere way out and not here.
[255:45.97]Just the center of the vortex does.
[255:48.08]What happened?
[255:51.56]Why is that place just destroyed?
[255:53.44]I don't understand what happened.
[256:04.01]I'm in the future?
[256:05.79]This thing's in the past.
[256:17.09]Alright, so what is... For a boss that was that horrendous, what does your rune do?
[256:21.43]Attacks recover HP after damage is taken.
[256:25.79]So, Bloodborne?
[256:26.31]Attacks made immediately after receiving damage will partially... Yeah, it's the rally from Bloodborne.
[256:33.42]That's kind of cool, but I don't really need it.
[256:36.42]Do I have all the runes?
[256:41.32]I have the entire... I have the whole Elden Ring, don't I?
[256:48.50]Lenia is daughter to Queen Marika and Radagon, and her great rune should have been the most sacred of all.
[256:55.04]I have the whole thing.
[257:01.38]Okay.
[257:10.65]Where's Miquella's rune?
[257:17.05]I don't know.
[257:24.37]Oh, the Remembrance, right.
[257:40.86]Okay.
[257:41.22]Alright.
[257:51.14]You need to get the other... I don't know.
[257:56.82]Hand of Malenia.
[257:58.78]Dex and strength.
[257:59.78]Causes blood loss.
[258:01.30]Dex 48.
[258:03.32]Blade built into Malenia's prosthetic arm.
[258:07.27]Malenia's war prosthesis symbolized her victories.
[258:10.87]Some claim to have seen wings when the weapon was raised aloft.
[258:14.29]Wings of fierce determination that have been never known defeat until I did it.
[258:19.21]Waterfall dance.
[258:20.17]Perform a series of one-footed leaps in the manner of a waterfowl to unleash a swift... That's the move.
[258:31.91]Is this the bullshit move?
[258:34.39]Well, I don't have 50 dex and I'm not going to get it.
[258:37.59]This is a faith move.
[258:39.29]Raise a giant flower that explodes with Scarlet Rot.
[258:46.20]Each time the Scarlet Flower blooms, Malenia's Rot advances.
[258:49.92]It has bloomed twice already.
[258:51.38]With the third bloom, she will become a true goddess.
[258:54.32]Did we do that?
[259:00.28]This Horned Lou...
[259:05.65]Oh yeah, this is the super.
[259:06.57]Yeah, we're not going to do either of these.
[259:08.23]Although, this move could be cool.
[259:19.90]It's an Ash of War, which I don't think I can use on either of my weapons.
[259:25.34]Get it for your collection.
[259:36.52]Melee.
[259:40.40]It's usable on all melee.
[259:45.17]Consume her soul and buy 500 throwing knives.
[259:49.39]What about the equipment?
[259:52.75]You can get the winged helm.
[259:56.93]Winged helm made of unallied gold worn by Malenia, blade of Mikaela.
[260:01.06]Malenia awaited Mikaela at the foot of the husk.
[260:04.64]My brother will keep his promise.
[260:05.86]He possesses the wisdom, the allure of a god.
[260:08.63]He's the most fearsome Empyrean of all.
[260:14.73]I don't want this, because I hate this boss.
[260:16.76]I hate this person.
[260:20.22]This could give you... This could deposit $5 a second into my bank account, and I would still not fucking wear it in principle.
[260:36.23]What a dumbass.
[260:37.05]Like, that's fucking stupid.
[260:38.13]I would just put it on and go idle and just go fucking go to the store.
[260:43.87]Just relax.
[260:44.55]I would just leave it on all day.
[260:47.83]I wouldn't even play the game.
[260:54.04]Five dollars a second is... Let me see how much of a dumbass I really am.
[261:00.66]How many seconds are in a day?
[261:06.08]There are 60 seconds in a minute.
[261:08.22]8,006.
[261:08.24]60 times 60 times 24.
[261:10.76]86,000.
[261:10.78]It's about $50,000 a day.
[261:34.01]$50,000 a day.
[261:36.35]Is it a day?
[261:37.08]$18,000 an hour and I wouldn't do that?
[261:41.94]Holy shit, I must have hated this.
[261:50.89]If I had $18,000 a day for putting this armor on and leaving my computer idle.
[261:56.05]Are you fucking dumb?
[262:00.64]Well, now I can't do that.
[262:02.08]Now the power is taken from me, right?
[262:04.66]I already said I wouldn't, so I can't have it.
[262:10.72]Cool armor.
[262:11.50]Never buying it.
[262:12.36]Never putting it on.
[262:20.93]That's cool.
[262:25.53]So now... I'm gonna smash them.
[262:33.65]I'm not going to use this, so I'm going to smash it.
[262:36.21]Plus, it means I get to kill her again.
[262:39.21]Piece of shit.
[262:51.36]Maybe I'll get the move for fun.
[262:56.08]Can I level up?
[262:56.70]I can't.
[262:58.40]Is it to level up one more time?
[262:59.72]140. 140.
[263:04.70]I'll get the move.
[263:09.93]I'll try it.
[263:10.29]I mean, why not?
[263:10.99]It's not like leveling up is going to do very much anymore anyways.
[263:13.09]Okay.
[263:25.16]You missed an entire underground area.
[263:30.11]How much longer do you plan on streaming?
[263:31.51]Um... I'm gonna try to beat the game tonight.
[263:34.87]Or at least... Get close enough where I have, like, one more thing to do.
[263:39.82]Where's the... You actually did.
[263:43.58]I did not do Deeproot.
[263:46.40]Do the underground.
[263:48.82]You missed a boss.
[263:50.34]You didn't fight... Check out the bottom left of our place.
[263:57.61]Hold on, let me take a look.
[263:58.93]How's it going over here?
[264:04.92]Where's my mouse?
[264:12.20]Is there another boss I can do?
[264:14.56]Don't beat it tonight?
[264:32.69]What happened?
[264:34.03]Oh, it's not loading.
[264:34.85]Okay.
[264:41.44]The bottom left?
[264:42.74]Bottom left.
[264:46.10]Uh, hold on.
[264:55.23]Uh, can you see?
[264:56.37]I don't want to do that.
[265:05.07]Okay, so... It looks fine.
[265:09.35]What's wrong with it?
[265:10.05]It's fine.
[265:16.03]We've got... We've got our little corner over here.
[265:19.41]I mean, I... I'll be honest.
[265:20.63]I wish you picked a different picture.
[265:22.37]I wish you picked a different photo.
[265:27.30]And I... Do I... Why do I have to have... Why do I have to be... Why am I among us?
[265:32.28]I'm not...
[265:37.73]This hair.
[265:39.17]Why are my eyes bleeding?
[265:41.98]Are these boogers coming out of my nose?
[265:44.50]That's so... Okay, I understand the boogers.
[265:47.04]I understand the boogers.
[265:47.80]I do.
[265:51.38]We don't need to move.
[265:52.45]We don't need to go anywhere.
[265:53.37]We can stay right here.
[265:55.75]What else is going on here?
[265:56.55]Let's see.
[266:05.79]Oh no, look at the United States.
[266:11.83]It's going under.
[266:19.38]What else is going on here?
[266:22.46]Whoa.
[266:25.26]It's like spilling out.
[266:32.28]That's crazy.
[266:42.95]Yeah, we don't have to go anywhere.
[266:45.83]We're fine where we are.
[266:53.67]Up left?
[267:00.26]What?
[267:05.74]Oh, that's... Oh, it's Aaron.
[267:14.71]Look at this.
[267:15.61]What's happening here?
[267:21.69]It's like a start menu?
[267:23.53]That's funny.
[267:31.71]Go up to the chessboard?
[267:32.61]Yeah, I saw the chessboard.
[267:34.37]Yep.
[267:35.84]Very cool.
[267:40.64]Oh, this is cute.
[267:44.91]This is cool.
[267:50.39]That's so cool.
[267:54.94]Yeah, we don't... Again, we don't gotta go anywhere.
[267:57.30]I'm not... I'm just observing.
[267:59.06]TK.
[268:02.30]Cool.
[268:12.82]I can't wait to see the time lapse.
[268:27.40]What the fuck is going on here?
[268:41.77]Is that- Is that a Gigachad?
[268:56.34]Cool.
[269:01.06]Alright, who is this in the- That's like a photo!
[269:07.78]This is like a- this is a photograph!
[269:13.47]This is insanely detailed.
[269:23.19]That's actually crazy.
[269:33.97]Star Wars.
[269:36.63]Oh, that's awesome.
[269:41.66]Alright, well that's fun.
[269:46.66]Oh, force it.
[269:53.18]Oh, here's more boogers.
[269:58.87]What?
[269:59.99]Oh, you took them away.
[270:22.61]Cool.
[270:22.77]Alright, let's get out of here.
[270:43.82]Second I said it.
[270:50.88]I spent all day looking at that.
[270:52.84]I mean, it's really, really fucking cool.
[270:56.75]Did you kill the boss at the end of Thea's quest?
[270:58.99]I did not.
[270:59.55]I don't even know what you mean.
[271:01.75]Alright, so where am I going?
[271:18.14]Go to deep... Deeproot.
[271:23.92]Go lie down and... I already did that boss already.
[271:25.78]Okay, so people saying go to Nokron.
[271:35.59]Okay, it's over here.
[271:47.23]Just go to your OBS and end the stream.
[272:00.58]Hold on, wait.
[272:02.80]I think I know where this is.
[272:03.50]I think I watched Holly do this.
[272:13.04]I think I know where this is.
[272:16.68]This is that place, right, Holly?
[272:21.50]Yeah, I think I know where this is.
[272:24.94]I think I know how to get her.
[272:27.57]you spoiled it no I just I've I like watching my girlfriend play I was almost just said Hollow Knight why why did I just say that oh I think I know how to get here you can get there from Mohg as well
[273:10.23]Okay, so we're here.
[273:12.67]I think I know where to go.
[273:14.35]I think.
[273:24.82]Yeah, am I going the right way?
[273:33.16]Yes, yep.
[273:34.66]Fucking shut up.
[273:35.98]I got really mad.
[273:38.86]Not you guys shut up.
[273:41.75]And then... Over here.
[273:48.89]You jump off a cliff.
[273:49.78]That's what I remember.
[273:50.38]Oh, that's not it.
[274:01.59]There it is.
[274:02.09]Okay, I got it.
[274:03.23]Yep.
[274:08.57]I remember watching her do this.
[274:09.47]I remember watching her at least go through this.
[274:11.43]Yeah, are you supposed to kill these?
[274:20.54]Because she was slaughtering these things.
[274:22.14]She was just like, whack, whack, blah, whack, blah!
[274:26.32]And I was like, do you need souls?
[274:29.15]You don't have to?
[274:29.71]Oh, that's what she was doing.
[274:35.61]So right now she's probably just like, you motherfucker, I did not do that.
[274:45.16]She's like, don't say that.
[274:46.36]Yeah, she's just like slaughters everything in this game.
[274:50.70]It's like actually kind of fucked up.
[274:57.38]Alright, so.
[275:07.62]That's the dude that raged.
[275:09.32]Alright.
[275:10.80]There's a difference between being very upset at Malenia the first night of Miquella.
[275:18.66]Okay.
[275:18.98]Oops.
[275:28.67]No, Jerma, this boss is too hard.
[275:30.33]Nothing is harder than Malenia.
[275:33.17]No way.
[275:34.37]No doubt.
[275:35.25]I don't think... I do not believe a word you're saying.
[275:47.36]I just killed somebody very far away.
[275:58.57]You're no joke.
[276:10.05]Nothing is even remotely as hard as Millenia.
[276:12.19]This whole game is going to feel like a cakewalk for the rest of the time I play it.
[276:18.98]I pressed the button and it didn't happen.
[276:20.02]Xbox controls sucks.
[276:35.87]No, of course... Horn shield.
[276:38.63]Of course.
[276:39.15]Oh, he's not killing the jellyfish.
[276:41.91]She actually loves the jellyfish.
[276:43.70]I find it to be really cute.
[276:46.42]Who's he talking to?
[276:47.96]I don't know.
[276:48.44]I think there's like fucking tons of people around me.
[276:59.74]It's a shield.
[277:06.59]ancient holiness dwells within first bullhorn skewers bows and performing shield bash oh my god epic
[277:58.65]Where is he?
[278:03.53]Okay, is it aqueduct or aqueduct?
[278:18.05]I say aqueduct.
[278:20.88]Aqueduct I like it
[279:02.11]What, did the Nintendo Switch 2 come out?
[279:12.89]Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold!
[279:14.59]Nice.
[279:20.56]Order healing.
[279:34.14]Death Blight.
[279:35.56]Int and Faith.
[279:37.00]That's really low.
[279:39.12]I can cast this spell.
[279:50.75]I should do it.
[279:52.67]Please gaslight me.
[279:56.53]No.
[279:57.11]I don't want... I want you to like... Have a good time.
[280:00.49]I don't want you to... Fuck up.
[280:02.21]You feel fucked up right now?
[280:10.26]Phew.
[280:15.02]Did I come from here?
[280:15.64]I did.
[280:18.30]Where do I go?
[280:18.70]Is there another way?
[280:26.98]Missed an item.
[280:27.54]I need to stop, like, looking over here at chat.
[280:33.25]Like, I'm just, like... Oh, right there.
[280:38.33]Oh, thanks, guys.
[280:39.65]You guys are the best.
[280:41.10]Thanks.
[280:41.36]I appreciate it.
[280:41.92]You guys are the best.
[280:44.20]Golden rune.
[280:44.78]Who cares?
[280:45.22]Got a brain up there?
[280:48.44]Turn around for a golden rune.
[281:01.09]I can go this way.
[281:03.61]Can I?
[281:05.59]Can't jump to there.
[281:07.51]Um.
[281:09.85]That way.
[281:10.09]I don't know.
[281:14.54]You can see Mohg's house from here.
[281:16.10]Can you?
[281:18.88]Oh, shit.
[281:19.34]You can.
[281:19.72]That's cool.
[281:20.58]It is right there.
[281:23.76]Oh, is it in time?
[281:24.46]Okay.
[281:41.57]It's pretty.
[281:41.93]It is.
[281:42.11]It's really pretty.
[281:48.12]Look at the stars to see a secret boss.
[281:52.20]I don't think that exists.
[281:53.20]Let's try gaslighter.
[281:57.59]What about down here?
[282:13.21]I forgot how fucking good this weapon was.
[282:17.21]I haven't used it the whole time.
[282:18.52]This thing is insane.
[282:24.96]Ah!
[282:26.08]What about the baby rattle?
[282:31.04]Baby rattle didn't do us wrong or anything.
[282:33.98]I give this a plus 10.
[282:38.52]Let me at least enjoy it for a little while.
[282:47.40]He's on 4.
[282:48.44]I am not supposed to be here.
[282:59.01]You're doing a YouTube build?
[283:00.69]I wasn't before.
[283:01.61]You know what?
[283:02.75]No, I'll stick with it for now.
[283:04.27]I want to play with it.
[283:04.83]I should kill this very easily.
[283:29.27]I thought that was a glitch.
[283:44.68]Wait, is it?
[283:44.96]Okay, there's another one.
[283:46.38]I have to kill you right now.
[283:58.84]Oh, he's getting close.
[283:59.92]That's scary.
[284:08.41]Poison gun's on that clock.
[284:24.68]Damn.
[284:34.51]Whoa!
[284:40.66]Let's end it with a Flash.
[284:52.02]Gargoyle's Greatsword, Gargoyle's Twinblade.
[284:54.68]Pretty sick.
[285:00.35]He's overleveled.
[285:01.39]Oh!
[285:01.55]Oh!
[285:02.31]Oh!
[285:02.43]Oh!
[285:03.74]Oh!
[285:04.54]Yes.
[285:05.30]I'm very overleveled.
[285:06.18]I'm like 150.
[285:06.78]I'm just going back because people said I missed the great room.
[285:16.48]I want to see the... Where is it?
[285:20.62]Ah, Goyle's Greatsword.
[285:21.58]Vacuum Slice.
[285:25.56]Just like the wielder, the missing parts have been mended with corpse wax, a patchwork of champions.
[285:31.00]Sea Strength.
[285:34.46]Venom Slice.
[285:35.62]I just read that.
[285:36.24]It was Vacuum Slice.
[285:38.36]What happened?
[285:43.91]Gargoyle's Twinblade, Sea Strength.
[285:46.33]Cool.
[285:50.13]That would actually be really fun to use in a strength build.
[285:54.61]Okay, let me see.
[285:57.17]Oh, there's got to be something here.
[285:58.79]I've got a thing that I missed.
[286:01.58]Hmm, I can't tell.
[286:09.32]Missed an NPC?
[286:14.07]I mean, guys, at this stage, there's literally one boss left.
[286:18.51]I'm not doing a quest line right now.
[286:29.16]I think actually I can level up again.
[286:30.32]Go back, you little runt.
[286:37.45]Who's you?
[286:39.66]Who's me?
[287:04.11]Are you gonna fight the final boss tonight?
[287:05.95]Um... It's getting really late, so I don't know.
[287:08.75]What time is it?
[287:19.13]It's like 1 o'clock.
[287:24.86]We'll see... I should probably take a break.
[287:35.53]Get some water.
[287:39.97]You need to go say sorry to Holly Knight.
[287:53.06]I did, didn't I?
[287:53.94]I'm sorry, Holly.
[287:55.38]I didn't mean to tell everybody that you were a murderer.
[287:58.88]Not true.
[287:59.12]Okay.
[288:03.02]Okay.
[288:13.82]Talk to the NPC, you get a Bloodborne reference.
[288:19.92]My mic has been pointed the wrong direction since I punched it.
[288:22.97]Like, three hours ago.
[288:32.05]Have I sounded weird for the last, like, two or three hours?
[288:36.21]Eat brute deaths.
[289:01.73]Okay, that's actually fucking good for people that are that big.
[289:10.85]Oh, no.
[289:11.31]You can start with it.
[289:12.65]You cannot finish with it.
[289:20.51]These guys were so hard.
[289:21.85]Of course, like, 10 to 20 hours of the game.
[289:23.65]They were terrifying.
[289:28.56]Staff of the Avatar.
[289:38.19]C strength, D faith.
[289:39.57]I actually would probably want to use this.
[289:49.10]Erdtree slam.
[289:51.34]Oh, that sends the golden shockwaves everywhere.
[289:54.78]Shit.
[289:59.65]Use the most broken sword in the game and says the bosses are easy.
[290:02.77]Dude.
[290:04.45]This weapon has been equipped for like 4% of my playtime.
[290:09.93]Okay.
[290:13.06]This is the weapon that I'm only using this because I want to get my plus 10 out of it.
[290:16.40]This is what I was using before.
[290:21.23]Like, I understand that, like, when people see the Moon Veil, they just go rabid because everybody in PvP just, like, spams it and everybody just hates it and it's an overpowered weapon.
[290:31.06]No, I get it, but you really gonna do that to me?
[290:37.83]This is my weapon.
[290:39.05]It's the Baby Rattle.
[290:46.63]I've only used that moon veil for like 2% of the game.
[290:53.70]Still can't level up.
[290:57.90]My axe and my bow.
[291:00.90]And my bow.
[291:01.90]And my bow.
[291:13.76]Oh, I can use the horse.
[291:19.09]What flavor of Axe body spray do you like?
[291:20.79]Do you remember when they did the chocolate one?
[291:25.27]Yeah, they did it.
[291:31.10]Yeah, they did a chocolate, like, body wash and body spray.
[291:48.83]And it was kind of weird.
[291:52.00]It was awful smelling, but at the same time, you kind of got used to it and you liked it.
[291:58.70]It kind of smelled like burnt sugar or something.
[292:02.82]You missed it.
[292:06.56]What?
[292:10.60]What did I miss?
[292:12.42]You missed it?
[292:14.69]What did I miss?
[292:22.33]There's a dung beetle.
[292:23.41]Whatever.
[292:24.83]Be strong.
[292:25.23]I'll get it.
[292:28.53]Yeah, it was really weird.
[292:29.97]It smelled like... Kind of like shit.
[292:34.99]It was one of those cases where be very careful when you go shopping for body wash.
[292:40.73]Because sometimes you'll be there and you'll pop it open and whatever.
[292:44.43]You like smell, right?
[292:46.11]Or like, does this one smell okay?
[292:48.57]Right?
[292:50.59]Don't trust that.
[292:53.54]Don't ever trust that.
[292:58.47]You get it home.
[293:01.07]And it smells terrible.
[293:02.73]Oh my god!
[293:03.65]Okay.
[293:08.79]In the hot shower, that gets gross.
[293:23.45]Go there.
[293:26.27]You liked it because it smelled like shit?
[293:32.31]No.
[293:35.69]Its concentrated form smelled okay.
[293:38.67]When it was heated up, it smelled pretty awful.
[293:43.36]That's a legendary item, by the way.
[293:44.62]Look at that.
[293:44.94]That's legendary beam.
[293:46.38]I'm gonna have to come from another way.
[294:10.92]Oh my god, it scared me.
[294:15.64]Okay, well, whatever.
[294:16.36]Am I gonna beat the final boss this stream?
[294:22.70]Probably not.
[294:26.04]What are these?
[294:31.00]Okay.
[294:34.42]Oh my goodness, that was... Okay, that was like in real life when a bug flies next to your head.
[294:39.53]I was about to just dash out of the room.
[294:42.95]Are you going to at least attempt it?
[294:44.87]Yeah, I don't want to go too, too late.
[294:48.26]Right?
[294:48.46]I don't want to just... I don't want to go so late.
[295:02.74]Depending how long this takes me, I might try, like, once or twice.
[295:05.46]And then I'll actually only have one thing left to do in the game.
[295:09.90]And then we'll do that.
[295:11.49]And then I'll start the, like, the PvP night.
[295:14.31]Like, the invasion night.
[295:16.49]Where I invade your game, potentially.
[295:18.93]Or maybe you summon me and I help you beat that piece of shit boss.
[295:23.05]We could probably combine those creeps together.
[295:26.90]Okay.
[295:34.11]River of blood exploit night?
[295:35.47]No, we'll have rules.
[295:37.41]We will ban weapons.
[295:38.89]And if you use them, you are excommunicated from the community.
[295:50.76]What the fuck?
[295:57.20]That's like a Minecraft chunk error.
[296:01.05]Whoa.
[296:07.57]There's a Finger Reader here.
[296:13.49]You good?
[296:22.02]Oh, Lord Godwyn.
[296:27.30]Such cruelty.
[296:30.05]Such humiliation.
[296:34.79]Oh, my poor, sweet lordling should have died a true death.
[296:42.85]As the first of the demigods to die.
[296:48.14]As a martyr to Destined Death.
[296:54.51]What are the Two Fingers?
[296:56.31]Oh, my.
[297:27.72]I think I can level up.
[297:41.57]They're just an alien radio antenna.
[297:46.13]Why make them a hand?
[297:47.51]Why make them... Are there markers down here?
[297:55.94]What markers do I have here?
[298:01.58]I don't have any markers.
[298:02.30]What's that?
[298:02.66]That's weird.
[298:25.91]What?
[298:30.25]Oh, nope.
[298:40.56]Ghost Lovework 5.
[298:41.58]Could have used that a while ago.
[298:51.64]Oh, shit.
[298:53.76]That's quite a congregation of those.
[299:06.06]Tried so hard, but I'm just way stronger than you.
[299:09.08]Good try, though.
[299:14.18]Is it only one?
[299:14.76]Oh, that breathes fire.
[299:16.94]Whatever, fucking I'm overleveled.
[299:35.65]Ashivore Vacuum Slice.
[299:37.17]I already have that.
[299:37.87]There's not much down here.
[299:42.72]Climb the tree.
[299:45.64]Let's check.
[299:51.88]Is this guy alive?
[299:53.34]Did he beat Malenia?
[299:57.90]I did.
[299:59.94]I got very lucky.
[300:01.28]I used a very powerful summon.
[300:02.70]I didn't use the mimic tier, but I used like the second best summon for that boss.
[300:10.51]Oh, it was a map.
[300:16.40]Oh, shit.
[300:16.58]Cool.
[300:24.70]Tiche is better than the Mimic?
[300:26.38]Oh.
[300:37.44]Okay.
[300:40.54]Go all the way west.
[300:42.44]I mean- is that a Tree Sentinel?
[300:58.60]What? Oh he's up there! Alright. Aw, come on.
[301:23.84]That was close.
[302:00.15]What's happening with the sound?
[302:08.67]What's wrong?
[302:16.69]What was harder Malenia or the last little of Simpsons hit and run Malenia?
[302:19.84]100 times.
[302:28.33]And I mean, I mean 100 out of 100 times.
[302:30.29]That's bullshit.
[302:35.95]No, it's not.
[302:38.68]That's the truth.
[302:42.48]Last level, the two towers.
[302:44.38]That was, that was fucking awful too.
[302:46.46]So what tree is this?
[302:49.86]If this is here, then this is the Erdtree, right?
[302:51.86]These are the, it's like the roots of the Erdtree.
[302:57.30]Right?
[302:57.68]This is the Erdtree.
[302:58.76]Why does it look all fucked up down here?
[303:00.00]Everything looks like all poisoned and shitty.
[303:19.00]Cool.
[303:20.96]Because you burnt it?
[303:27.67]Well, I didn't.
[303:31.65]A lot of runes over here.
[303:35.37]Clarifying... Clarified Butter?
[303:38.73]We'll have to get in that.
[303:45.46]Hold on.
[303:55.68]Hold on.
[303:55.88]There's an Omega Knight in here.
[304:32.58]Thresh on his mind.
[304:33.28]I wonder if he'll change his mind about it being 100 times harder.
[304:35.92]It's past your bedtime.
[304:38.08]It is, but I'm close to completing Elden Ring.
[304:48.13]We'll see how tired I am.
[304:49.27]I'll take a break after this fight.
[304:50.95]This is definitely a fight down here.
[304:52.12]Why would you tell me to come down here if there wasn't?
[304:54.56]Let me look over here first.
[305:07.17]Oh my god, it's a boss.
[305:08.79]I did not think you were going to be here.
[305:10.25]Oh.
[305:19.21]Got it!
[305:23.11]Ooh!
[305:29.85]Got ya!
[305:38.98]Seluria's tree.
[305:42.14]This is another person's tree.
[305:44.62]Seluria.
[305:59.31]Whoa, Crucible Tree armor.
[306:15.68]This is pretty good.
[306:17.22]Cool.
[306:43.83]Do you only read mean messages?
[306:45.13]No, I don't think so.
[306:48.88]It's like 4 a.m.
[306:49.88]I am Pacific.
[306:53.48]PST.
[307:00.16]I'm going to take a quick gander over here.
[307:01.48]Then we'll go in the coffin.
[307:03.06]Cool.
[307:17.24]I thought that was a turtle.
[307:28.13]There's a bell?
[307:31.33]There's one of those bell things here.
[307:36.09]Down there.
[307:36.73]Damn.
[307:46.51]I don't have an item.
[307:51.07]Alright, be careful.
[307:56.34]Oh, shit.
[307:57.12]Cool.
[307:57.64]Alright.
[308:06.08]They give you a lot of those, uh, resemblances.
[308:08.18]I don't really care for it right now, but it's cool.
[308:28.09]Hmm.
[308:28.91]Interesting.
[308:31.25]Very interesting.
[308:32.29]Okay.
[308:33.81]Ooh, what's that?
[308:43.67]What is this?
[308:45.43]Mausoleum soldier ashes.
[308:46.87]Okay, that's cool.
[308:47.51]I actually want to look at those.
[308:50.88]Alright, coffin time.
[308:51.60]A lot of smithing stones here.
[309:00.96]If you're looking for smithing stones 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, there's a shitload here.
[309:04.09]Okay, back to the coffin.
[309:15.59]Please, don't do that.
[309:22.28]I hear a twinkle.
[309:24.43]Aha.
[309:32.07]Is that... Spinning those... Are those spinning those... Whatever.
[309:34.68]I know the words I'm trying to say.
[309:36.52]They're just not coming out right.
[309:37.50]Coffin, no, no, no.
[309:42.14]Coffin, no.
[309:42.88]Not in the coffin.
[309:45.59]Up the roots.
[309:46.67]Like up here?
[309:47.11]This is where I'm going?
[309:55.29]We're losing him.
[309:55.79]Am I going the right way?
[309:59.79]Other routes.
[310:00.99]Up the routes near the coffin.
[310:12.82]Back where the gargoyle was spitting fire at you.
[310:14.40]Okay.
[310:29.23]Go over there.
[310:35.87]Backseaters?
[310:36.51]That's okay.
[310:37.43]I'm actually thankful for the backseaters.
[310:41.24]Because... It's getting late.
[310:44.74]Not that I don't want to rush through the game.
[310:47.46]Not a million years.
[310:49.53]But it's getting late and I kind of want to see what's down here.
[310:52.37]What are you saying over here?
[311:16.76]There.
[311:20.04]Don't help him.
[311:20.80]No help.
[311:33.25]I don't think so
[312:07.61]No, no, no.
[312:09.09]Nodders.
[312:09.77]Don't cough in my face.
[312:14.13]I didn't mean to.
[312:17.21]Oh, up there.
[312:33.12]Two Fingers stand for peace.
[312:35.34]Well, I'm a Slytherin.
[312:38.16]I don't want that ending.
[312:45.93]Oh, shit.
[312:47.95]How far do I have to go for it?
[313:01.07]um there oh all the way all the way I'm going all the way oh boy oh okay
[313:34.99]How do I get off the horse?
[313:49.74]This looks like a boss area.
[314:14.57]What the hell is this?
[314:26.82]That wouldn't happen in real life.
[314:29.74]If you step on a branch, it doesn't explode.
[314:40.26]How close do I have to get to this thing?
[314:49.03]What the fuck?
[314:52.93]Oh no!
[314:54.77]It's... A little shit guy.
[315:05.10]Oh no!
[315:09.68]You know, I'm gonna let you hit me three times.
[315:12.11]Two.
[315:16.47]Three.
[315:17.01]Okay.
[315:18.29]That was four.
[315:18.79]That's just about enough for you.
[315:26.20]See you later, dickhead.
[315:30.64]Burn!
[315:55.86]Roger?
[315:58.90]What is he doing here?
[315:59.86]What?
[316:00.10]I don't want to fight Roger.
[316:07.87]Why?
[316:12.33]Bro, they hate you.
[316:13.45]What did I do?
[316:14.07]I didn't do anything wrong.
[316:17.70]Roger, you're still using spells for level 15, buddy.
[316:22.10]It seems the student has become the master.
[316:25.82]I hate the way my face looks sometimes.
[316:27.26]It seems the student has become the master.
[316:41.08]This guy works for Fia.
[316:42.55]No way!
[316:51.41]Alright, who's next?
[316:52.19]In like the fuckin'... gauntlet.
[316:58.22]Okay.
[316:59.48]Bro, why?
[317:02.70]Lionel the Lionheart?
[317:04.70]Fia's champ- why am I- what's happening?
[317:06.64]Why is everybody ganging up on me?
[317:13.76]I killed that guy in one swing.
[317:17.20]That was somebody's little brother.
[317:19.02]You could tell.
[317:19.48]He was wearing the pumpkin head.
[317:22.82]Nobody puts that on, unless you're like 14.
[317:24.60]He's away from me.
[317:46.67]Am I going to fight five people at the same time?
[317:48.61]Lionel is fat rolling.
[317:53.45]Is that it?
[317:53.93]He is missed.
[318:01.63]Honest to God, what the fuck is that?
[318:19.09]This looks like me?
[318:20.01]That's horrifying.
[318:44.44]Pumpkinhead's actually a pretty good item.
[318:45.86]That was rude.
[318:55.76]I don't even know what they want.
[318:59.88]I actually don't know what they want.
[319:02.92]Everybody speaks in riddles in these games.
[319:24.16]Dost thou want thy golden finger?
[319:28.10]What do you want?
[319:31.20]My lord doth how Destined Death.
[319:33.05]Okay.
[319:35.59]What?
[319:37.91]I want to be held.
[319:38.57]Okay.
[319:44.15]You are an odd one.
[319:45.99]I am the guardian of Those Who Live in Death.
[319:49.27]They call me a foul and rotten witch.
[319:53.22]Yet you still wish to be held by me?
[319:55.84]I want the item you're gonna give me, then I'm gonna kill you.
[320:12.59]Walk in secret.
[320:13.83]Have you ever seen a Hallowbrand?
[320:16.71]When the first of the demigods died, his flesh was marked with the half-wheel wound of the centipede.
[320:24.00]Godwyn's Hallowbrand has since been recovered at the Round Table Hold.
[320:29.08]But there is another Hallowbrand out there somewhere, and I must find it.
[320:34.57]Before the time comes, we receive our Lord.
[320:42.81]When Godwyn died, a hallow brand scored his flesh.
[320:47.51]But another exists.
[320:49.97]Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede.
[320:54.42]And I must find it.
[320:56.18]Before the time comes we receive our Lord.
[320:59.62]My hands will be dirtied once more by the deed.
[321:03.47]Will you still let me hold you?
[321:09.97]Oh, I have this.
[321:12.47]Give curse mark of death?
[321:13.91]This is Ranni's curse mark.
[321:26.12]This is the curse mark.
[321:35.90]Oh my utmost thanks with this Godwyn can take his rightful place as first of the dead.
[321:43.17]Did he get up?
[321:43.87]And claim a second illustrious life.
[321:47.19]Wait I'm about to bring Godwyn back to life?
[321:49.47]Our true champion and though I can't be of any use to you can I hold you tight if only for a moment?
[322:04.29]Radiant Baldachin's blessing.
[322:11.44]And it will surely Ster within me the new life of the golden prince and first dead of the demigods as the rune of Those Who Live in Death.
[322:23.19]Please, do one thing for me.
[322:26.73]Brandish this child, my rune, and take for yourself the throne.
[322:33.41]Stay the persecution of Those Who Live in Death by becoming our Elden Lord.
[322:43.32]My rune?
[322:44.46]They get a rune?
[322:46.91]How are you gonna lay with Godwyn?
[322:52.98]He's like a big... He's like a big cheeseburger.
[323:26.39]grow hair.
[323:32.89]Now that's just SAP.
[323:33.83]That's just SAP.
[323:35.03]SAP.
[323:36.56]The golden
[323:50.73]Us killed.
[323:51.55]This is goodbye, my dear.
[323:53.81]But I am satisfied.
[323:56.07]I choose to lie with Godwyn of my own will.
[324:00.69]Not the remains of one chosen for me.
[324:03.73]And I will bear a child who will inherit your warmth, too.
[324:08.75]What greater blessing could there be?
[324:12.07]But to be born a deathbed companion.
[324:14.56]What are you gonna- This is goodbye, but I am satisfied.
[324:18.70]I choose and I will- Who will inherit you?
[324:21.05]What greater- How are you- How?
[324:42.36]What is that?
[324:44.37]It looks like a, like, dragon scales.
[324:47.33]I think we should get up.
[325:05.86]Enter the deathbed dream?
[325:15.69]This is fucking weird.
[325:36.48]Lich Dragon Portisax?
[325:40.15]What?
[326:08.34]He's so overleveled for this.
[326:10.88]Feels pretty good after Millenia, I'll tell you.
[326:32.12]Holy shit!
[326:36.18]Wow!
[326:39.11]What does that do?
[326:56.37]Oh, that's Death Blight.
[326:57.69]That's hell.
[327:11.07]Remembrance of the Lich Dragon?
[327:13.33]Holy shit.
[327:20.70]That was, yeah, that was 3k a swing.
[327:22.24]Yeah.
[327:42.04]Mending rune of the death prince Excuse me Can be used to mend the shattered Elden Ring
[328:03.37]Formed of the two Halobrand half-wheels combined, it will embed the principle of life within death into order.
[328:10.76]That feels like an AI-generated sentence.
[328:12.50]Let me read that again.
[328:14.14]Formed of the two Halobrand half-wheels combined, it will embed the principle of life within death into order.
[328:25.54]Golden Order was created by confining Destined Death.
[328:29.04]Thus, this new order will be one of death restored.
[328:36.89]What does that mean?
[328:37.53]I now have the whole Elden Ring.
[328:43.33]I should be able just to put it all together and just eat it.
[328:48.41]That's cool, though.
[328:49.16]That fight would have been a... How come this is not on?
[328:55.98]Cannot be used.
[328:58.14]Why not?
[329:01.12]This guy.
[329:01.80]I swear to God.
[329:12.92]Fia's hood, Fia's robe.
[329:18.50]I'm very confused.
[329:22.65]Fia's hood.
[329:28.05]Put a black cloth that covers the whole head.
[329:29.83]Won by Fia, the deathbed companion, on her journey after being exiled from her home.
[329:33.43]The fabric itself is a soft silk.
[329:34.75]Gives a shit.
[329:50.16]Curse Mark is your baby?
[329:51.48]Put away those Baldekin's blessings.
[329:56.48]Yeah, I got a super one.
[330:00.08]Use FP to temporarily boost poise.
[330:03.26]Okay.
[330:06.04]Blessing is of the utmost rarity.
[330:10.04]It's said a deathbed companion will only produce a blessing of this kind for a champion but once in her entire life.
[330:16.46]So a blessing which she imbues of her own volition.
[330:20.59]This is just the shitty one.
[330:21.41]Okay.
[330:24.15]That can't be used.
[330:33.90]Gives it more max HP forever.
[330:37.66]Is it actually?
[330:38.32]Are you fucking... Are you fucking... Are you fucking... Are you... Are you kidding me?
[330:44.05]Are you kidding me?
[330:52.50]Let's get to 60.
[330:57.40]Addy's here?
[330:58.08]No way.
[330:58.74]Really?
[331:00.26]Addy's here?
[331:00.68]What's up, man?
[331:11.37]We love your videos.
[331:14.65]Time to get all your lore questions answered.
[331:17.71]Addy.
[331:18.85]Addy.
[331:18.99]Let me just tell you.
[331:25.56]Take your time.
[331:26.00]Take your time.
[331:30.36]It's probably an incredible amount of pressure for you to come out with some of these videos.
[331:36.25]Take your time.
[331:38.73]Go wait.
[331:42.19]Go wait.
[331:45.37]The amount of shit to piece together that I've been seeing from tons of people in the community...
[331:51.27]People are still kind of trying to guess what things even mean or what this place actually means.
[331:57.18]Oh, I found this.
[331:58.82]I found that.
[331:59.60]It's still happening a month later.
[332:02.78]Don't feel too much pressure.
[332:03.94]Seriously.
[332:04.66]Like, we can wait.
[332:08.64]Very excited, though.
[332:12.11]Truly, truly love your videos.
[332:13.75]I really do.
[332:16.29]Thanks for stopping by.
[332:23.69]Can you give us a sneak peek?
[332:26.53]What?
[332:27.63]The hornblowers.
[332:29.01]What are those?
[332:30.97]Aliens?
[332:33.70]What are the hornblowers?
[332:35.70]Whose fingers are those?
[332:37.14]Whose fingers are those?
[332:38.08]Can you give us a little... Give us something small.
[332:42.78]Why is there gold shit everywhere?
[332:43.90]There's gold dung.
[332:48.67]Everything's gold.
[332:49.39]Is the gold shit... Why are there Two Fingers?
[332:51.27]Okay.
[332:52.17]Okay.
[332:56.23]No, I'm kidding.
[332:56.95]I'm kidding.
[332:57.33]I'm kidding.
[332:59.81]He probably gets this shit everywhere.
[333:03.68]Like, oh, Vaddy's here?
[333:05.60]Explain in minute detail, uh, incredibly intricate stuff that takes like an hour to explain in five seconds.
[333:11.30]What does that mean, Vaddy?
[333:13.56]Like, he probably gets this fucking everywhere.
[333:19.61]Nah, uh, it's cool to see you here.
[333:23.21]He left.
[333:26.32]Alright, well, should I try to beat the last boss?
[333:28.82]Should I go for it?
[333:36.45]Let's do it.
[333:37.13]Let's see if I can do it.
[333:43.93]Oh, the coffin.
[333:44.73]Where does the coffin go?
[333:52.60]Ah, the remembrances.
[333:54.90]Right.
[333:58.61]If I can figure this out.
[334:01.83]After Godwyn the Golden became the Prince of Death, the ancient dragon fought long and hard against the death within its companion.
[334:09.74]Alas, victory was never achieved, and its only reward was corruption.
[334:15.40]I think those Two Fingers are giants.
[334:17.10]I think they're a giant species of giants, and they were killed.
[334:21.95]And they only have, like, hands remaining, and they can communicate with the Golden Order.
[334:30.29]I also think that there's Two Fingers, and there's apparently Three Fingers.
[334:35.27]Excuse me.
[334:36.29]Um, excuse me.
[334:37.98]How much does that make?
[334:39.56]Excuse me.
[334:41.42]One, two, three, four, five.
[334:42.34]Excuse me.
[334:44.16]That was a whole hand at some point.
[334:46.22]That's five fingers.
[334:48.32]Excuse me.
[335:04.79]And why did these... Why did these fuck off and never come back?
[335:09.84]You would think that the whole world being changed, they'd be like, you know what?
[335:12.82]Come out of sleep mode.
[335:13.78]I don't understand.
[335:16.70]Oh god, really?
[335:17.64]Portisax, lightning spear, and death lightning.
[335:26.65]47 faith.
[335:29.25]That's probably so cool.
[335:41.72]It said this golden lightning was wielded by Godwyn, who befriended Fortisax.
[335:45.37]So why did we just kill Fortisax?
[335:48.83]Just eat it.
[335:49.27]You know you're going to anyways.
[335:53.81]What level am I?
[335:55.41]I am 150 exactly.
[335:58.65]We are going to probably end the game at 150.
[336:01.66]It depends on if I can actually beat this or not.
[336:09.82]Alright, let me give it a good try.
[336:12.56]It is late.
[336:13.34]I don't have to beat it tonight.
[336:25.21]I am going to... I gotta remember the... Radagon fight.
[336:29.37]Because you have to do that first.
[336:30.51]Let's go.
[336:31.92]Okay.
[336:35.72]I'm gonna be bright.
[336:41.23]Here comes the cool music though.
[336:45.42]Here we go.
[336:46.78]Final fight.
[336:55.20]Tarnished.
[336:57.58]In search of the Elden Ring.
[337:00.96]I must extinguish thy flame of ambition.
[337:08.77]Begin.
[337:11.86]so so so
[337:55.23]Oh, you do another one.
[337:56.37]Fuck!
[338:01.50]Oh my god, I thought it punched me in the face!
[338:03.80]I thought I could... Okay, alright.
[338:07.68]Well, that's been a while.
[338:08.30]I haven't played this in a while.
[338:14.54]I haven't played against fucking Radagon in a while.
[338:20.45]I'm so busy fighting Millenia, just panicking and dodging every five seconds.
[338:24.15]I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[338:31.87]What the fuck does that mean?
[338:40.13]That happens really quickly.
[338:47.51]Should I jump if he does that?
[338:50.13]You know, I never learned his entire moveset.
[338:53.71]I literally just summoned somebody and freaked out.
[339:06.13]I think you just have to stay close to him.
[339:16.71]This also is definitely not a place to have like seven flasks.
[339:22.98]I need all of them.
[339:30.12]Also, why am I not just using this?
[339:32.50]That was really dumb.
[339:37.69]How would I ever use that other move?
[339:39.11]It takes way too long.
[339:42.90]can happen?
[339:46.31]What the fuck happened?
[339:49.37]What happened?
[339:50.81]He's deflecting.
[339:54.19]Oh, that's what's going on.
[339:55.76]He's deflecting the magic and throwing it back.
[340:04.48]Okay.
[340:06.34]Alright.
[340:07.45]Alright.
[340:10.81]Get it.
[340:16.80]So let's just beat the shit out of him.
[340:27.03]He can't do that to the moon.
[340:31.99]Use the laser beam?
[340:33.73]What if he just deflects a thousand of them in a row and kills me in one hit?
[340:37.63]Try it.
[340:42.66]Hold Y and press R1!
[340:47.30]It's too late now.
[340:58.70]No.
[341:00.48]I was gonna beat him up.
[341:10.05]I didn't shoot any spells at him.
[341:11.39]What the fuck was that bullshit?
[341:23.17]God damn it!
[341:26.89]I think I fucking expelled every ounce of gamer juice on four hours of Millenia.
[341:40.18]Where are you?
[341:46.00]I have no idea.
[341:53.13]Fucking baby rattle, you piece of shit.
[342:14.04]so so
[342:41.13]Fucking Babyrattle sucks absolute balls.
[342:43.43]Like, oh my god, that hits with every other weapon in the game.
[342:51.46]What he's... I gotta get around him.
[342:53.02]Behind him, I'm dead.
[342:54.78]Yeah, you gotta get behind him.
[343:06.18]Dude, fuck off!
[343:12.15]Ah, I didn't want to jump.
[343:13.09]My fat fucking fingers hit it!
[343:20.37]You gotta get far.
[343:20.95]What the fuck?
[343:30.72]Flail sucks.
[343:44.88]Flail has, like, a hitbox of, like, here.
[343:49.06]It's, like, here.
[343:51.46]It's literally the hitbox of the flail is, like, fucking four inches in front of you.
[343:55.31]It's, like, weep.
[344:02.35]Elden Ring sucks.
[344:03.61]Elden Ring sucks.
[344:10.70]Get this fucking item off.
[344:13.70]It's the goddamn last boss in the game.
[344:15.42]Who cares?
[344:45.86]He caught it almost all of that.
[344:54.88]Oh my goodness, he did it twice!
[345:09.96]And it really makes you feel like you're out of the ring, you know what I mean?
[345:11.88]It really makes you feel like you're out of the ring.
[345:18.81]Actually, it was a good strat.
[345:24.98]You can summon?
[345:25.58]I want to summon at the second phase, I think.
[345:34.28]That actually kind of worked.
[345:52.97]No!
[346:26.48]I don't fucking know what to do.
[346:46.90]Oh my god!
[346:49.67]I gotta go behind him, stop dodging back you fucking idiot!
[346:55.92]I didn't mean to press that button.
[347:03.10]God fucking dammit, fuck the last three bosses of this game.
[347:17.43]I'm gonna start over.
[347:28.35]What, you don't like AoE spam bosses?
[347:31.33]No.
[347:33.01]No, I don't.
[347:34.15]No, I don't.
[347:40.71]Underleveled?
[347:41.56]What?
[347:41.80]I'm level 150.
[347:42.12]What are you...
[347:51.40]It's easy to dodge all of his attacks.
[347:52.72]Okay.
[348:15.63]You fucking didn't bring Tisha in your pocket?
[348:17.51]What are you talking about?
[348:21.37]What?! !
[348:52.24]I dodged it.
[348:58.90]Teach you and I are good friends.
[349:08.38]I've never seen this part.
[349:14.38]I know what happens here.
[349:15.88]L plus overleveled plus still losing plus using the katana plus using Comet Azor plus ratio.
[349:29.38]Let's go.
[349:32.78]Let's do it again.
[349:33.82]Fuck it.
[349:42.65]Who cares?
[349:43.29]What's going on?
[349:53.41]Oh my god, how do I do this?
[349:54.61]What do I do?
[350:05.34]I'm being such a fucking idiot right now.
[350:11.74]He's confirmed better player, by the way.
[350:20.51]Oh my god, what does that mean?
[350:34.74]Oh, what?
[350:36.34]What the fuck happened?
[350:41.88]Whoa!
[350:44.18]What the fuck, man?
[350:45.34]It's like I'm on the highway and I'm walking the opposite side of the highway.
[350:49.08]It's like cars driving at me 100 miles per hour.
[350:51.24]Oh, god damn it.
[351:01.55]You just run?
[351:12.89]Holy shit.
[351:16.83]I'm just doing it.
[351:17.63]I don't even care.
[351:18.21]Is this hitting?
[351:25.44]Oi!
[351:51.12]Holy fuck!
[351:52.58]Oh fuck!
[351:54.58]Get it away from me!
[351:56.87]Get it away from me!
[352:07.19]What the fuck?
[352:17.77]Have the FromSoftware devs been playing Overwatch recently?
[352:23.30]Do they like that game?
[352:24.58]Is that their favorite game?
[352:35.15]It's like you're just filling my screen with just colors.
[352:41.09]It's like, what the fuck is happening?
[352:45.38]Five people ulted at the same time.
[352:59.71]Come on, you didn't even fucking go this way!
[353:40.09]My fucking hand is so sweaty.
[353:41.75]Sometimes you can't even press the button.
[353:58.39]Don't hit me, don't hit me, don't hit me, don't hit me!
[353:59.73]Thought he was dead.
[354:15.71]Alright, let's go.
[354:18.19]How do you get sweaty from pressing buttons?
[354:19.63]I've been holding this control over six straight hours.
[354:35.38]Oh, God.
[354:35.74]I'm going to get behind him.
[354:37.80]No, I'm not.
[354:39.52]I don't know what to do about this.
[354:47.53]I can't fucking hit animation shit.
[354:57.51]Can I get on the horse?
[354:58.07]Of course not.
[355:03.35]I just don't get in that, right?
[355:05.02]Don't let it get inside.
[355:05.94]I don't... Am I in it?
[355:09.10]Do I have to jump over it?
[355:10.98]I think you have to jump over it.
[355:13.88]I don't know.
[355:33.56]Goddammit.
[355:34.46]Run.
[355:34.74]Oh, it's right on my heels!
[355:49.07]Don't you really have to go all the fucking way over there?
[355:51.01]I'm out of stamina.
[356:06.87]What the fuck?
[356:07.97]Let me over there!
[356:10.89]Bastard!
[356:11.75]Sorry for the language.
[356:25.02]You just... I don't fucking know.
[356:39.65]You...
[356:54.19]Why do you keep fucking going away?
[356:55.81]Fight me!
[356:56.59]Fucking Jesus Christ!
[357:35.31]I don't... What the fuck?
[357:41.10]Come over here!
[357:44.73]Nope.
[357:54.82]I don't have any heals.
[357:59.48]Oh, fuck.
[358:00.94]I have one heal.
[358:08.31]Oh my goodness, this fucking swing animation.
[358:10.65]All of you motherfuckers are in slow motion in this goddamn game.
[358:20.95]It's like everybody's in slow motion and everybody just explodes the whole fucking boss room.
[358:38.36]This motherfucker, he's like, okay, you get close and then he just teleports across the whole game.
[358:42.52]Where's my horse?
[358:45.60]And guess what?
[358:47.80]The game crashed.
[358:49.89]What a surprise.
[358:52.55]It's fucking six out of ten.
[358:54.28]Teleport.
[359:16.93]See it running.
[359:17.45]Please come chase me.
[359:42.57]I'm gonna beat it right now.
[359:50.78]I know the game didn't- I know.
[359:52.64]I understand.
[359:53.12]I need rest?
[359:57.16]I almost just did it.
[360:07.75]Get rid of this fucking thing.
[360:09.13]I don't want this- I'm just using it.
[360:10.47]I don't want this thing in my inventory.
[360:33.12]Me strong exposed!
[360:49.76]so so
[361:11.96]God damn it, I wasn't close enough.
[361:13.56]You're gonna fucking do it three times.
[361:14.86]Thank you, Tish.
[361:33.84]Let's go.
[361:50.79]Oh my god, FromSoftware, what the fuck is that?
[361:53.85]I tried to lock on and it just...
[362:27.32]This is the ring.
[362:28.08]I don't get this part.
[362:28.86]I think I can jump.
[362:29.78]I'm going to try jumping over it.
[362:30.68]I'm going to jump over it.
[362:32.06]I'm going to jump over it.
[362:45.57]What is- what the fuck is in the way?
[362:46.83]What the fuck is go- I can't see shit!
[362:50.70]What- get this fucking mist out of here!
[362:53.68]What the hell?!
[362:55.98]I couldn't fucking see anything!
[363:11.21]Is that actually the end of the... Look at how huge this place is.
[363:27.37]Tish dodged it.
[363:28.81]Yeah, Tish didn't have, like, gold vapor in his eyes.
[363:32.99]Who are you?
[363:33.41]What's your name?
[363:34.07]Yeah, I'm a fucking idiot.
[363:51.45]put Elden Beast in the meat grinder?
[363:55.63]They just decided to just... I got pigeons.
[364:04.18]We'll talk about them later. ...
[364:20.70]Come on, man.
[364:35.20]Come on.
[364:52.25]Oh, I fucking messed it up!
[364:59.73]Aw, the AoE spam bosses, they just shoot it across the whole fucking room!
[365:16.01]What if I happen to just swing swords at each other?
[365:19.46]Does every last, like, three or four bosses in this game have to have a fucking bomb?
[365:23.59]A bomb!
[365:25.36]An over and over again fucking missile!
[365:46.02]I can't even hear the music over it.
[365:48.27]You're just dropping fucking missiles, man.
[366:15.65]Didn't think he had another attack, but how the fuck can you tell in this game?
[366:35.03]EXPLOSIONS!
[366:37.06]OH FUCK!
[367:05.63]Shaking my goddamn, shaking my head, shaking my S-S-ing my head.
[367:09.86]Shake, shaking my head.
[367:29.01]I'm curious, does this do any damage?
[367:30.31]I'm not getting close to him.
[367:50.51]Nah, I'm fucking so far away.
[367:51.95]I can't even tell how far away I am from this motherfucker, I swear to god.
[368:07.77]alright jump over it
[368:39.57]I thought I could go through it.
[368:40.37]I don't... GET IT AWAY FROM ME!
[369:03.28]GET IT AWAY... WHAT IS... YOU SON OF A FUCKING MISSILES!
[369:07.36]GET THIS FUCKING THING AWAY FROM ME!
[369:11.10]What the fuck, man?!
[369:12.86]Leave me the fu- Oh my god, it's off the Elden Ring!
[369:27.75]No!
[369:28.25]What the fuck?!
[369:37.41]What?
[369:44.07]Can I attack him?
[369:58.06]I didn't want to roll that way!
[370:07.22]Deez kill it!
[370:08.06]Deez kill it!
[370:08.92]Deez kill it!
[370:10.02]Deez kill it!
[370:14.72]That was horrible.
[370:42.61]Such fractured Marika?
[371:02.06]Summon Ranni.
[371:07.10]Oh, let me do this first.
[371:09.82]You know, I haven't... I actually... I haven't... There's a couple little dungeons I want to do in Limgrave.
[371:15.64]Because I didn't see what this was.
[371:16.58]I think I'm going to go check that out.
[371:33.39]Summon Ronnie.
[371:36.10]What is that?
[372:01.96]The battle is over, I see.
[372:31.75]There's four hands.
[372:50.19]I do solemnly swear to every living being and every living soul
[373:01.49]Now cometh the age of the stars.
[373:03.36]Did I make a mistake here?
[373:06.16]A thousand-year voyage under the wisdom of the moon.
[373:11.74]Here beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond.
[373:21.96]Into fear, doubt, and loneliness, as the path stretcheth into darkness.
[373:55.24]Let us go together
[374:06.04]My dear consort, Turno.
[374:35.56]Did I beat the boss?
[374:41.08]Good.
[374:41.32]That fight was stupid.
[374:56.59]He blacked out.
[374:57.45]Yeah.
[375:01.05]Wow.
[375:03.69]Wow, what did I say?
[375:04.37]6 out of 10?
[375:06.58]That's not, um... That was me being angry.
[375:09.78]It's way better than that.
[375:12.87]What happens?
[375:13.59]What?
[375:13.77]I don't get it.
[375:28.10]Keesh is the true Elden Lord.
[375:35.87]Rennie, alright, what happened?
[375:37.77]She literally killed the boss for you.
[375:39.15]Good.
[375:39.91]I'm glad.
[375:43.18]It's complicated.
[375:46.74]Rennie started a thousand years of night killing the tree and freeing the souls then.
[375:50.58]Okay.
[375:51.42]You basically give her the power and she decides to fuck off into space with you, leaving the planet without a mean god to rule over it.
[375:57.45]No more gods.
[375:58.15]People control their own lives.
[376:01.11]You started a new age.
[376:02.25]No more Elden Ring.
[376:04.55]You just gave them self-government.
[376:09.09]Huh.
[376:13.14]No more greater... No more bullshit greater will in Two Fingers.
[376:18.00]Oh, who care?
[376:18.56]Yeah, fuck them.
[376:19.36]They... They... They fucked off... Halfway through the game.
[376:24.24]Which I don't get that either.
[376:25.18]Why did they leave?
[376:30.80]They just like... They went like... They lost their connection to the router.
[376:38.40]Everyone gets free will now.
[376:40.98]That seems pretty good.
[376:41.84]What's the rating for the game?
[376:48.63]It was 9.7 after the Malenia fight, and after that fight, it's a 9.8.
[377:12.72]nine point six nine point six five nine no that's not that's it it's higher okay I honestly I thought these I thought this was like a Kickstarter that there's like Kickstarter people there's so many names just here I thought this was like thanking like the Kickstarter people
[377:37.88]Um, holy shit, that's a lot of names.
[377:42.08]Uh, it's a 9.
[377:42.92]It's a 9.
[377:44.60]A 9.8 is so simple.
[377:46.20]It's so easy.
[377:46.70]9.7 feels correct, but I feel like it's low.
[377:58.74]9.78.
[377:59.42]There it is.
[378:00.22]It's a 9.78.
[378:14.89]Bloodborne was a 9.4.
[378:17.15]This is better than Bloodborne.
[378:30.78]I think so.
[378:34.24]That's slander.
[378:35.78]This is coming from somebody whose Bloodborne has been their favorite.
[378:40.25]Bloodborne has been my favorite game ever of all time since it came out.
[378:45.07]If Bloodborne was 60 FPS, it might be a lot closer.
[378:50.73]9.78.
[378:51.01]This is so close to being a perfect game.
[378:58.45]And, like, what's the theory?
[379:00.18]There is no such thing as a perfect thing.
[379:02.18]10 does not exist.
[379:04.56]There's no such thing as a 10.
[379:05.72]And, like, a 9.9 feels like horseshit.
[379:11.42]Like, okay, really?
[379:13.04]You gave it a 9.9?
[379:18.92]10 doesn't mean perfect.
[379:22.96]It probably is a 10.
[379:24.54]Ask me tomorrow.
[379:27.03]Sekiro, I did not.
[379:28.05]I was not a big fan of Sekiro.
[379:32.09]I thought Sekiro was good, but I did not think it holds up to this.
[379:39.17]Ask me tomorrow.
[379:39.83]It would probably be like a 9.87.
[379:44.85]Wow, what a fucking masterpiece it is.
[379:52.40]He said Half-Life Alyx was a 9.6.
[379:53.54]Yeah, and this is better.
[379:56.30]By a small amount.
[379:59.03]I think it is better than Half-Life Alyx.
[380:01.13]Half-Life Alyx is in a different kind of category for me, though.
[380:05.79]But this is better than Half-Life Alyx.
[380:13.34]Was Bloodborne worse than Half-Life Alyx?
[380:16.10]No, it just ran like shit.
[380:20.27]It just ran like shit, and we can all pretend like it didn't.
[380:24.99]Bloodborne seriously runs like crap.
[380:31.58]And they did- okay.
[380:33.02]It was on PS4, and they didn't even give a PS4 Pro version or some- anything.
[380:38.81]Anything to get it away from like the 28 to 30 FPS that it was, and 25 FPS.
[380:45.31]I just wish there was even a PS5 version for it.
[380:47.85]Anything.
[380:48.53]Anything to make that game not like 25 FPS.
[380:54.45]This game is heavily flawed.
[380:57.53]I think you've heard me complain about half of the things that we... Yeah.
[381:01.86]But even with a lot of this game's issues, when I was like, oh, we'll talk about that later.
[381:08.00]For open world games, nothing comes remotely close.
[381:12.54]The last open... Look at the last open world game that you played that you gave a shit about.
[381:16.24]Like, really.
[381:17.12]Don't say Breath of the Wild.
[381:18.01]We all know what you're going to say.
[381:19.47]Forget about Breath of the Wild.
[381:23.43]I haven't given an absolute fuck about any open world game.
[381:27.09]They're all dog shit.
[381:28.61]I haven't played a truly good open world game in a long time.
[381:30.79]Red Dead Redemption 2 was good.
[381:32.69]But Red Dead Redemption 2 felt... Didn't feel like this.
[381:39.70]I loved Red Dead Redemption 2's story and its world, but I think this trumps it in sort of gameplay, kind of immersion.
[381:50.88]Red Dead Redemption 2 is very good, don't get me wrong, but I don't think it... I don't think they even compare.
[382:04.31]Red Dead Redemption 2 is a good movie.
[382:07.18]Okay, I sat there with Red Dead Redemption 2 and loved every second of it.
[382:10.94]But yeah, I was kind of just... Trotting around on the horse and... Talking to, like, Dutch and... Crafting food and gunslinging.
[382:19.92]It was a lot different.
[382:21.93]Begin journey 2.
[382:22.51]Oh, okay.
[382:26.85]I can do it from the round table.
[382:30.47]Open world game has not done that to me.
[382:33.77]How I feel about this.
[382:35.73]Since...
[382:38.84]God, I don't know.
[382:41.74]GTA 4, maybe?
[382:42.78]Maybe GTA 5.
[382:48.22]But even GTA 5.
[382:49.90]Yeah, I remember playing GTA 5 and I was fucking floored.
[382:54.57]GTA 4, maybe a little bit more because that was the first time where it was like a new engine.
[383:00.49]It's been about 10 years.
[383:07.13]Fingers are still gone.
[383:09.42]Check the remembrances.
[383:10.24]Yeah, I will.
[383:12.84]Yeah, I got two to look at.
[383:15.22]Yeah, and of course, okay, look, for all my frustrations with this game, for all the times you heard me say, like, this sucks, this is dog shit, it's coke.
[383:23.19]This truly is one of the best games that's ever been made.
[383:25.19]Like, I think everybody can agree on that, even if you don't like it.
[383:27.85]This is, without a single doubt in my mind, will go down as one of the single greatest pieces of playable media ever.
[383:39.75]I really do feel that way.
[383:43.39]Let me show you something.
[383:52.12]What about God of War?
[383:53.32]God of War... I... Yeah.
[383:58.38]When I walked out here for the first time, and knew that I had no directions, and I saw this...
[384:08.26]It was a feeling that was just like right here that I haven't felt since I was like fucking probably 20, like 19.
[384:14.24]That's how I gauge whether or not a game is like, like, holy shit, this is crazy.
[384:21.95]Uh, walking down here and realizing like how much is here, going even to these first, this first like kind of shack, realizing that you can find things on the map, find little dungeons.
[384:34.07]It's terrifying.
[384:35.35]It is an overwhelming, horrifying experience.
[384:42.03]Nothing has done that since probably, I don't know, maybe like the Eat the Engineer video?
[384:51.57]Game is very front-loaded.
[384:53.11]I will... I will say the game is very front-loaded.
[385:01.43]I think that this area here, leading into Kalid...
[385:06.87]And then a little bit, probably, I, I, but hold on, I did love, um, I did really like the, kind of, capital area.
[385:15.04]Elmery was really cool too.
[385:16.08]I, I can't say that this was particularly, like, incredible.
[385:22.59]It's kind of just snow and fog.
[385:26.76]But I don't think this first, like, 10 to 20 hours of the game, maybe even the first 30 to 40 hours.
[385:34.58]Ray Lucario was crazy, too.
[385:36.18]Like, walking in these front doors.
[385:43.44]And making DLC as well, yeah.
[385:46.02]Like, when you do this, I did it on stream.
[385:48.76]You saw how I reacted to it.
[385:52.24]You go through here, and you get to see the Ray Lucario building.
[385:57.61]Yeah, Azula was, yeah.
[385:59.85]There's way more good zones than bad zones.
[386:01.51]Let's just put it that way.
[386:03.97]The game does fall off a little bit at the end.
[386:06.77]I have to admit that.
[386:09.67]Kind of feels like they just throw a bunch of shit at you in the last, like, ten hours.
[386:14.92]Like, seeing this in the distance, seeing, like, Azula in the distance, being here, seeing the Urge Frees...
[386:24.43]But the first 40 hours of this game makes up for the last 5 to 10 hours a hundred times over.
[386:35.73]Where's the... Where's the... Is it right here?
[386:44.37]Where's the... We can see the building.
[386:49.40]The end bosses ain't, aren't bad though.
[386:52.52]I just, I feel like the last couple bosses just felt like just very spammy and annoying.
[387:00.16]And you know what?
[387:02.57]Here's a complaint.
[387:04.69]We have this really cool horse.
[387:07.35]We don't get like a final, like epic battle where we can use the horse in that last area against the Elden Beast.
[387:14.65]That would be cool.
[387:17.64]Like, Torrent's been with us the whole game, and we don't get to kind of have that ending with Torrent.
[387:22.69]I feel like that's a big ball drop.
[387:25.99]Especially because the boss moves around so much.
[387:32.15]I wanted to take Torrent to the end, but Torrent really kind of felt like a real afterthought in the last, like, ten hours or so.
[387:40.24]The Fire Giant was the last time that I really thought I really needed to use it.
[387:46.87]But, that's not why- that's why I don't think it's 10.
[387:49.87]I think it's like one of the best games ever made.
[387:52.00]I think it's like a 9.7- 9.8- 9.9- maybe.
[387:54.50]But who gives a about scores that's stupid anyways.
[387:58.00]Who cares about like me have- I gotta give you like a score.
[387:59.99]No! This is one of the best games ever made.
[388:02.00]That's all you need to know. Stamp it. Recommended.
[388:05.00]Best game- one of the best games of all time.
[388:07.00]That's it. That's all you need to know.
[388:09.00]Who cares about like an arbitrary: well 9.78.
[388:12.00]Like, why am I even having that number? I'm making that number up. That number makes no sense.
[388:22.46]I'm going to the same place.
[388:32.46]Better than Bloodborne?
[388:33.40]Yeah, it is, but just because it's just a newer game, newer technology, not on a PlayStation 4.
[388:37.26]And you know, it's kind of depressing in a way.
[388:48.57]you know that post uh best masterpiece game ever made kind of depression here I'm like sad the game is over that's why I haven't gone to bed yet like look at this like this is just this was so awe-inspiring it's like okay this will explain it really well what the fuck is in there
[389:13.81]You don't know.
[389:15.25]You know it's gonna be really... You're gonna be... You're probably gonna be in that room somehow.
[389:18.59]You're gonna be all over this place.
[389:21.42]And seeing it at a macro kind of scale... It hits you in this weird way where you just don't... You're so confused.
[389:29.68]You're so terrified of this thing.
[389:31.32]You're so awe-inspired.
[389:34.38]You know you're gonna walk around every room in this place.
[389:38.31]And you know it's gonna be hard and you know it's gonna be scary.
[389:41.07]But, like, let's fucking go.
[389:44.86]Is this the honeymoon period or do you actually really like it?
[389:48.16]I mean, it's been almost 40 days.
[389:50.80]I don't think there's much more time for a honeymoon phase.
[390:02.57]A lot of places in the game did that.
[390:04.17]Especially in Limgrave.
[390:05.17]Especially here.
[390:05.77]Is there a fake wall in there?
[390:15.09]And let me find my favorite spot.
[390:17.71]But... I know, I'm kind of stalling to end the stream here.
[390:21.15]But still.
[390:24.07]I know I'm stalling, but... Having that area... Where you can see this... Let me see if I can find it here.
[390:39.10]It's from a cliff.
[390:40.52]And it's just... You can't even believe that you can see it.
[390:45.22]Where is it?
[390:47.84]It's kind of far away.
[390:49.40]Maybe here?
[390:49.84]There's one spot where you can see the Lucaria and a couple other things.
[391:01.90]North of Stormville.
[391:02.74]Yeah, I know it's up here somewhere.
[391:03.94]This is it right here.
[391:11.00]Yeah, I mean, the stream's over, but we're just hanging out.
[391:18.41]Yeah, this is it here.
[391:23.47]It's just... You know... Alright, you just saw it up close.
[391:29.87]From far away, it seems... The journey seems so awesome from here to there.
[391:38.41]Mount Gelimer is right there.
[391:39.53]You got one of the churches.
[391:40.60]You got Ray Lakari.
[391:44.22]It's just... I love it.
[391:46.32]It's sad that it's over.
[391:49.11]But that's what me... I'm about to R1.
[391:51.95]Hello?
[391:53.48]Is someone there?
[391:54.50]My name is Hayate.
[391:56.82]And I'm journeying in search of the distant light.
[391:59.60]I wish the ruins weren't so repetitive.
[392:02.58]Some of those dun- Alright.
[392:05.18]If we're gonna- Okay, you just heard me gush about the game.
[392:08.30]Some of those dungeons were dog shit.
[392:10.66]Some of those dungeons were just awful.
[392:12.41]Just truly terrible.
[392:14.01]Just complete afterthoughts.
[392:15.59]It was- I want to say maybe 5 to 10- Maybe like 10% of them were pretty awful.
[392:26.45]But that's not that... There's so much in the game, though.
[392:29.35]It's so easy for me to sit here and not for us to be like, that was fucking stupid.
[392:32.83]Those dungeons were terrible.
[392:36.37]But, I mean, like... Look at all this.
[392:44.76]You don't have to do them.
[392:49.40]That's why it's not a perfect game.
[392:50.69]But it's pretty damn fucking close.
[392:53.43]And I know I've been swearing a lot, but I just... I'm exhausted.
[392:57.32]A bunch of disappointing AAA releases.
[392:58.81]This is pretty great.
[393:01.17]Yeah, that too.
[393:01.95]That too.
[393:02.45]Let's be... Let's talk... No more criticisms.
[393:07.51]I think this... Shows... That you can still make incredible experiences that people...
[393:17.70]that people will- the jaw will hit the floor still.
[393:21.04]I know, like, God of War, it was an- I told you, the first, like, two or three hours of God of War, I thought were fucking unbelievable.
[393:27.04]Um, I feel like that game dropped off for me a little bit, though, but, again, that first, like, hour of God of War, especially that first major fight, was, like, it did the same thing.
[393:37.85]It hit me in the same place.
[393:38.77]I was like, holy shit, this is cool.
[393:42.71]uh it's still it's still here and anybody that tells you that like oh gaming's dead every all games suck it's awful what the industry's in this in the shitter right now it's like I mean this look at this this exists um and my god what a journey it was are we at for time 105 well let's say 104 104 hours
[394:15.85]I've never put 100 hours into a single campaign, ever.
[394:19.05]I don't think that's... That's never happened.
[394:20.55]I have to be real.
[394:24.95]That has never happened in my whole life.
[394:28.29]Never.
[394:33.32]I played through Bloodborne a bunch of times, but all those playthroughs were like 40 hours.
[394:36.36]40 to 50 hours.
[394:36.78]Dark Souls 3 was like 50 hours, right?
[394:38.66]40 to 60 hours, maybe?
[394:47.33]GTA V would probably come close.
[394:49.63]Somewhere around probably like 70 or 80.
[394:51.99]Not 100.
[394:52.17]One more for the road.
[395:01.34]How many times did I die in total?
[395:06.62]What's the total death count?
[395:16.89]736 times oh my god 736 but yeah alright let me tell you my plans for the future of this game because I'm not done with it because I'm sad and I don't want it to end so it's not going to we are going to do a like community night
[395:43.31]I am going to... You can summon me.
[395:44.95]We'll do... I'll put my sign down without a password.
[395:46.77]We'll do summons.
[395:48.61]You guys are having trouble with something, maybe I can come help.
[395:51.75]Me strong needs to do his first, like, ten hours... First five hours.
[395:56.22]Maybe first two hours.
[395:58.06]I want to do, like, a PvP, like, invasion night.
[396:00.60]At least maybe we'll combine the whole thing.
[396:06.22]So, it's not over, but it's not going to be a priority anymore, considering I just beat it.
[396:15.60]Elden Ring is now... It's not going to be every single stream.
[396:22.15]It will be... Maybe once in a while.
[396:25.21]Maybe the next stream will probably be something else.
[396:27.41]We'll probably move to some... Well, we'll see.
[396:29.51]But it's not a priority anymore.
[396:37.70]And that's the end of the stream.
[396:39.62]Thanks for staying up late.
[396:41.20]Thanks for putting up with my anger and my bullshit.
[396:44.42]I really appreciate it.
[396:45.64]As always, of course.
[396:47.70]Wrong thing.
[396:49.98]That was an incredible journey.
[396:51.02]The game is unbelievably good.
[396:55.05]And I am incredibly happy to have shared it with you.
[397:00.43]Let's just be real.
[397:02.33]That was really fun.
[397:05.96]Let's be really honest.
[397:07.36]That was some of the most fun just kind of playing a video game and hanging out with you guys I've had in a long time.
[397:13.87]Glad to see it go.
[397:18.91]I didn't even look at the remembrances.
[397:20.01]It's true.
[397:29.36]That was amazing.
[397:37.21]So, see you in another ten years when another fucking masterpiece comes out.
[397:42.90]God damn it.
[397:46.32]Marika's hammer.
[397:51.26]Stone hammer made in the lands of the Numen.
[397:53.84]Outside the Lands Between.
[397:55.00]A tool with which Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring and Radagon attempted to repair it.
[398:04.21]Wait.
[398:05.95]The hammer partially broke upon shattering the ring, becoming splintered with rune fragments.
[398:13.33]This is not a masterpiece?
[398:15.39]I think it is.
[398:18.18]I think it is.
[398:22.02]We can have different opinions, that's alright.
[398:25.50]I don't think it's perfect, but I do think it's a masterpiece.
[398:31.62]Sacred Relic Sword.
[398:35.24]Thoughts on what the weapon portends are many and varied.
[398:38.12]Some consider it the mark of a great sin or a sign of great devastation.
[398:42.38]Some think it is at the end of an age, while others the beginning.
[398:45.13]Combue the sword with bygone golden glory, then fire at foes.
[398:49.57]A wide golden wave fans out, sweeping through all enemies caught in its path.
[398:55.50]Another faith.
[398:56.42]Dex faith.
[398:57.52]It's the farming sword?
[399:05.28]There's masterpieces you haven't played yet.
[399:06.76]I... Okay.
[399:12.17]Let's announce it.
[399:14.03]I'll play Breath of the Wild.
[399:17.30]I will.
[399:20.10]Not immediately, but we'll queue it up.
[399:23.46]I will queue up Breath of the Wild and we'll play it.
[399:34.37]You can't play Breath of the Wild after this.
[399:36.21]We're going to wait a little bit.
[399:38.89]I'm not going to just like, oh hey guys, Wednesday's stream is Breath of the Wild.
[399:43.53]No.
[399:44.34]I'll give it some time.
[399:47.78]This is really cool though.
[399:50.16]I'm not going to do any of that right now.
[399:53.86]Alright.
[399:54.98]Enough stalling.
[399:55.61]Thanks for staying up with me.
[399:59.82]That was a wild one.
[400:00.96]I feel like I fucking had a meltdown, accepted the meltdown, had another meltdown, and then had an end to the stream.
[400:07.14]That was like three meltdowns in a row.
[400:10.64]Wasn't there like a black and white, like, I'm smoking on camera routine?
[400:14.72]I don't remember any of that.
[400:20.37]Almost accidental cock reveal, that's right.
[400:22.85]What a fucked up stream.
[400:28.09]I almost showed my dick on stream.
[400:32.75]Let's call it what it was.
[400:35.24]That's unbelievably... That's awful.
[400:38.16]I'm fucking wearing jeans from now on every stream.
[400:43.70]That's fucked up.
[400:46.74]No, I'm kidding.
[400:47.82]I have pants on.
[400:50.12]I have undergarments on.
[400:51.94]I'm kidding.
[400:52.69]My fly is open.
[400:59.59]I have pants on.
[401:00.45]I was kidding.
[401:02.39]Camera got barely below your chest.
[401:04.00]Yeah, but I didn't know that.
[401:04.86]A lot of people are just like, what is he talking about?
[401:10.16]What the fuck are you talking about?
[401:13.36]Wait.
[401:14.92]Is Hugh still here?
[401:19.02]I didn't even check.
[401:23.04]They're still here.
[401:23.68]I see.
[401:25.40]You're here.
[401:38.68]Don't feel too bad about this being over.
[401:39.94]There are many masterpieces you've never played from the last 30 years.
[401:43.01]Yeah, that's true.
[401:43.95]That's a good way to think about it.
[401:45.61]It is.
[401:49.71]I'm sad, too, because, you know, it's that everybody's into it.
[401:52.97]Everybody's trying to piece together the lore, and everybody's so happy about it.
[401:58.00]I don't know.
[401:58.54]It just feels cool.
[402:00.69]Big, giant gaming community events like this are always awesome.
[402:04.90]Seeing, like, all the gifs and all the people, funny ways they've died, all the... funny stories people have, people can tell.
[402:12.92]Doesn't happen that often.
[402:14.12]Once every, like, three or four years, we get something like this.
[402:21.85]So, the next stream... Let's take a look at a calendar here, because it's not gonna be tomorrow.
[402:28.33]Or today, whatever.
[402:31.86]Um, let's go... Let's go for Tuesday.
[402:39.75]Tuesday the 5th.
[402:43.99]What's your favorite boss?
[402:46.46]Uh, Hoarah Loux.
[402:47.94]Let me think.
[402:48.28]Uh, Hoarah Loux slash Godfrey is probably my favorite of the whole game.
[402:55.28]I could do a tier list eventually here.
[402:56.56]Total playtime, 105 hours and 47 minutes?
[403:09.69]The big centipede... What?
[403:13.79]The void?
[403:14.87]Big centipede void thing was really just terrifying and awe-inspiring.
[403:19.08]Probably that one was pretty high.
[403:21.48]Astel, yeah.
[403:24.78]Rikard was cool, but Rikard was kind of a gimmick, though.
[403:28.46]It was a fun gimmick, but it was still kind of a gimmick.
[403:33.21]If I had a top three, it'd be Hoarah Loux, Astel, and...
[403:43.02]Maybe Godrick.
[403:44.66]Even though I talked a lot of shit.
[403:47.16]The music for Godrick was awesome.
[403:50.40]The scene where he takes the dragon was really cool.
[403:56.51]Mohg was cool.
[404:02.49]Favorite non-boss.
[404:04.37]Oh, that's right.
[404:04.91]Placida.
[404:05.57]Placida Sacks was pretty cool as well.
[404:07.99]That's right.
[404:10.81]Yeah, I would put that in the top five.
[404:13.68]Could be a mariner, yeah.
[404:16.10]What about the baseball stream?
[404:17.92]I don't have any updates for you for the baseball stream.
[404:20.46]I do have a very vague update for you that it's going to happen probably in July.
[404:33.05]Couldn't get it done in time.
[404:36.47]So July, I'm going to have a hard date for you probably in the next few weeks.
[404:43.13]Look for a hard date.
[404:45.11]You'll get it soon.
[404:48.33]It'll be in the summer.
[404:55.74]It's gonna... No, it is gonna happen.
[404:56.88]That's gonna be one of my favorite streams ever.
[405:03.16]Any updates on Grotto Beasts?
[405:05.20]Grotto Beasts is another one of those things that I need to put a lot more of my brainpower into.
[405:12.56]My brain has been very focused on, like, one thing for the last month.
[405:17.68]Um... But yeah, it's also... That is still a thing.
[405:28.68]All things ceased to exist while Elden Ring was a thing.
[405:32.00]I was kind of afraid of that, but... How many more stream events are we going to have this year?
[405:42.36]I would say at least two.
[405:43.22]Baseball is guaranteed.
[405:45.76]And then there might be one more.
[405:47.05]There might be one more big one.
[405:50.61]Might be very big.
[405:57.97]Good night, everybody.
[406:00.06]See you again on Tuesday.
[406:01.92]4 p.m.
[406:05.34]Pacific.
[406:08.68]Take care of yourselves.
[406:12.54]Those of you that have been here for the entirety of Elden Ring, thanks for sticking around and going on the journey with me.
[406:19.56]I've said it before, but I'll say it again.
[406:23.54]Have a great night.
[406:24.42]We'll see you Tuesday.
[407:13.74]Thank you.
