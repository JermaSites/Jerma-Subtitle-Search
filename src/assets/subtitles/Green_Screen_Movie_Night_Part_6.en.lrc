[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.78]Good morning.
[00:04.64]What?
[00:05.28]Good afternoon, is what I meant to say.
[00:06.94]How are you?
[00:08.68]Good afternoon or evening, wherever you are in the world.
[00:11.74]How are you?
[00:14.80]Morning makes no sense.
[00:23.31]Today, we have an interesting stream today.
[00:26.47]I decided to get Freddy Fish 3.
[00:33.97]And a search for the kelp diamond.
[00:41.56]No, this is green screen movie night.
[00:45.04]Let's... I'm gonna wait, because we need people to trickle in here.
[00:48.46]People have been waiting for this for a while, so I want to make sure that I don't just go... Oh, let's go!
[00:52.50]Hurry up!
[00:55.66]Hopefully you have something to snack on.
[00:59.04]Maybe I've heard some of you have made some popcorn.
[01:03.73]Pretty cool.
[01:06.47]Maybe you've got a beverage.
[01:09.59]I've got a green tea.
[01:10.73]I was thinking about having a little bit of alcohol tonight.
[01:16.33]But I think I might have to not do that because I'm sick.
[01:19.97]Still having problems.
[01:20.81]Probably a bad idea.
[01:25.44]I thought about maybe just drinking like a couple of beers, but it's probably not a good idea for how I am now.
[01:31.63]And how I am now, I'm still coughing, I'm still having issues, and you'll probably hear it from time to time, but I've been pretty good at muting and muting the sneezes and shit too.
[01:39.75]So.
[01:42.21]Dude, come on!
[01:44.31]Jerma, aren't you like 20?
[01:46.57]I don't know why anybody ever thinks this.
[01:48.81]No.
[01:52.05]Aren't you 20?
[01:58.23]Okay, so here's what happened.
[01:59.25]Tonight, if you don't know, how good you're not, we've been hyping this up for like a month now.
[02:05.21]This is green screen movie night.
[02:08.95]Over the course of the last two or three weeks, we have had people submit videos using footage from the last three and a half to four years of green screen footage.
[02:19.68]Recently, last month, or not last month, maybe three weeks ago, four weeks ago, just about under a month,
[02:27.30]Went in front of the green screen again.
[02:28.57]I did a bunch of weird shit.
[02:30.97]And... There were almost a thousand submissions.
[02:36.01]Almost one thousand submissions came through.
[02:39.35]And I wanted to make a point of this.
[02:42.34]Because... I have to say this, right?
[02:47.54]If your video is not shown, don't be discouraged.
[02:50.94]It's just there was a lot to go through.
[02:54.46]All the videos were vetted and put in, and we're going to do maybe two nights.
[02:59.22]Maybe we'll do three nights.
[03:00.58]So even if you don't see your video tonight, that doesn't mean it was a bad video, right?
[03:05.14]That means that you might show it.
[03:06.18]It probably will show up during an encore night, which I'm not even going to call it an encore night because there are so many, there are so many good submissions that we're just going to do this twice.
[03:20.25]There's no way we're only going to do this once.
[03:22.27]It's physically impossible.
[03:23.91]Out of the, I think, what were the total amount of submissions?
[03:27.02]Submissions?
[03:27.90]Submissions.
[03:31.18]Yeah.
[03:32.68]800?
[03:32.70]900?
[03:34.60]We'll probably show at least a third of these, or if not more.
[03:39.37]But I can't show them all, right?
[03:41.73]Even if it's good.
[03:43.01]Even if it's going to be hard to show all of these.
[03:49.15]So if you watch this tonight and you go, where the fuck is my video?
[03:53.47]Don't.
[03:55.08]Because it could show up on the next one.
[03:57.80]And if it doesn't show up on the next one, then don't be discouraged, please.
[04:01.78]It was just a lot to go through, and we had to just select ones based on how much effort went into this one, or who thought... All the mods and community leaders, did they think this one was funny?
[04:14.03]Because I haven't seen any of these.
[04:16.39]I have not seen a single one of these.
[04:17.79]That's a lie.
[04:18.33]I'm lying to you right now.
[04:19.35]I've seen probably four.
[04:21.75]But that's what I need to say.
[04:26.65]That's what I need to say.
[04:29.65]I'm a liar.
[04:31.86]I'm very excited.
[04:32.58]We have... How many videos are there?
[04:34.44]Let's see.
[04:36.46]There are... There are one... There are almost 200 videos.
[04:40.74]As of right now, still cleaning the playlist up a little bit.
[04:44.67]198 videos on this playlist.
[04:46.23]Are you fucking kidding me?
[04:49.43]I hopefully can get through this in the next four to five hours.
[04:56.39]So... We'll find out.
[05:02.93]Yeah, the consideration for videos that were going to be shown were how much will chat like this?
[05:06.99]How much will I like this?
[05:12.02]I'm hyping this up.
[05:13.04]We're hyping this up.
[05:13.96]I'm not just going to go.
[05:14.80]Guys, 300 million people have been waiting for this stream.
[05:23.42]Divide that by like 1,000 or 2,000 or whatever or 10,000.
[05:31.75]It's been a long time since we've watched any of these.
[05:37.65]You guys ready?
[05:38.78]It's been about... I should wait for about 10 minutes.
[05:42.22]Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[05:43.80]Let me wait for 10 minutes.
[05:45.52]Did I tweet?
[05:48.74]Did I tweet?
[05:49.36]I did, right?
[05:50.76]Just making sure I tweeted.
[05:53.46]Oh yeah, I did.
[05:54.20]Oh yeah.
[05:58.03]Hey, hey, you guys... You guys ready to laugh?
[06:02.13]You guys ready to laugh it up?
[06:05.65]Let's go, go, go, go, go!
[06:07.43]Alright.
[06:10.70]Alright.
[06:12.72]Without further ado.
[06:16.00]Ladies and gentlemen.
[06:22.24]Oh, wait!
[06:25.82]Sorry.
[06:27.14]Also, the audio on these, we did make a rule where you couldn't have abrupt loud sounds.
[06:32.36]But none of this stuff is equalized.
[06:33.91]So just be aware that some videos might be way louder than others.
[06:37.93]Some videos might be at a certain decibel level.
[06:41.19]I have a limiter that I can turn on.
[06:43.19]So if it gets to be too crazy, then I'll turn it on.
[06:46.85]But I don't think I'm going to need to as of right now.
[06:50.06]Okay?
[06:51.56]We're just going in full blast.
[06:58.07]So it's probably going to be loud, some of these.
[07:01.49]And some have jump scares, by the way.
[07:04.09]Some of these have... They do?
[07:06.21]Alright, some of them have jump scares.
[07:08.25]Okay, thanks for the warning.
[07:09.13]Some of them have jump scares?
[07:11.17]Be ready for jump scares, too.
[07:12.51]Alright, I'm not waiting anymore.
[07:16.79]Adjust your volume as you see fit.
[07:19.37]Because it's going to get loud here.
[07:21.61]Here we go.
[07:27.83]We are T--2 minutes away.
[07:29.99]Also, be ready to dance, too.
[07:32.63]Be ready to dance, is what I've been told.
[07:36.39]Why do you hate EU fans?
[07:38.91]I wanted to, like, drink three drinks of vodka tonight to this stream.
[07:44.58]And I'm not drinking at fucking 10 o'clock in the morning.
[07:46.74]Okay?
[07:49.52]But I might have to cancel my drinking tonight.
[07:52.84]We'll see.
[07:53.36]After, like, an hour, we'll see how I feel.
[07:57.05]Refresh.
[07:57.47]Yeah, I did.
[07:58.19]I got it.
[08:00.13]You're a coward.
[08:00.99]No, I'm ill.
[08:03.52]I'm physically ill.
[08:09.92]That did sound fake, and it may have been.
[08:17.03]Okay, that was very loud.
[08:18.05]That was a good test.
[08:18.87]That was a good test of the sound system.
[08:26.53]I'm so excited.
[08:27.55]I'm so excited.
[08:33.07]And I just can't hide it.
[08:36.97]I know, I know, I know, I know, dun dun.
[08:39.69]Whatever it is.
[08:40.13]Alright, I'm not waiting anymore.
[08:43.71]We're almost at the 10 minute mark and everyone's already here.
[08:46.20]Everybody's here.
[08:46.64]Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

[10:52.85]You have to go like that.
[11:22.21]37 years old, I don't twerk.
[11:23.79]Is that a joint?
[11:36.08]It's twerking time.
[11:41.06]That was an original song, by the way, if you were curious.
[11:43.08]It's called Jerma's New Friend.
[12:08.33]Oh, shit.

[17:24.04]Pretty good start so far.
[17:26.64]No cam.
[17:27.12]I'm not going to put a cam on, by the way.
[17:28.48]People have asked for it.
[17:30.02]I don't want to mess with the integrity of the video files.
[17:33.91]I think it's better that way.
[17:36.21]So we can get engrossed.
[17:37.25]You don't have to look at my fucking ugly mug in the corner.
[17:42.00]I might pop in from time to time.
[17:43.24]You never know.
[17:45.50]By the way, people are like, oh, whoa.
[17:47.08]Hooray.
[17:47.74]Good.
[17:48.04]That's it.

[18:50.04]Heartbeat.

[19:49.35]You have only 10 minutes to escape them, yes.
[19:53.29]You're gonna die.
[19:54.95]Don't even think about leaving.
[19:58.65]No, you can't just leave.
[20:01.85]You can't just leave.
[20:41.20]The sound part is... I want to see the sound part again.
[20:45.61]Nice job.
[20:46.81]Oh, no shit!
[20:48.37]What?

[21:03.10]I want to see... This part is so dumb.
[21:07.04]I need to see this again.
[21:07.76]No, you can't just leave.
[21:17.06]You can't...
[21:26.77]The best part about that is when the gas hits, that's when the tricycle falls apart.
[21:30.46]That's perfect.
[21:32.16]Well done.
[21:32.70]Well done.
[21:33.10]Well done.
[21:34.46]Oh my God, that was funny.

[21:38.62]We got to keep going.
[21:40.92]No stopping.
[21:41.64]Be careful.
[21:42.10]Things could be loud.
[21:43.05]I'm just warning you.
[21:43.99]Another Catholic Griffin state.
[21:50.49]The Battle of Home Depot 2.

[24:47.95]There was a lot to take in here.
[24:51.31]This is my favorite part of the whole thing.

[25:38.05]I'll deal with you later.
[25:40.75]Hello, boys and girls.
[25:43.45]It's-a me, Mario.
[25:45.99]Let me tell you something.
[25:47.95]If somebody want to tell you to take drugs, always say no.
[25:53.14]You see, Luigi tried to drink and do drugs one time, and I said no.
[25:58.90]And he said, Mario.
[26:00.20]And I said no.
[26:02.15]You should never take any drugs.
[26:04.51]Never.
[26:04.89]Mario wouldn't.
[26:05.94]Luigi wouldn't.
[26:07.14]Toad?
[26:07.50]Maybe.
[26:10.64]What the fuck is this?
[26:11.42]We don't need to talk about Toad.
[26:13.63]Don't do drugs.
[26:15.05]If you do drugs, you'll end up like King Bowser.
[26:19.43]Boys and girls, don't do drugs.
[26:22.15]You don't have to do them.
[26:23.38]Don't feel pressured to take drugs or drink.
[26:26.24]If anyone ever pressures you, tell them Mario said, so long, King Bowser, and they will leave you alone.
[26:32.64]This is called Jermastraction News, How Bees Make Honey.
[26:43.77]This is Crashbox.
[26:49.38]and now distraction news with your anchor person dora smarmy good evening I'm dora smarmy and welcome to distraction news where we give you the news and then ask you questions about what we've just reported so make sure you're not distracted pay attention now for our top story today how bees make honey
[27:14.22]The female worker bee flies from the hive to a flower.
[27:17.44]When she arrives, she climbs in and using her hollow straw-like tongue, she drinks nectar.
[27:23.35]The nectar enters the bee's crop or honey stomach where she mixes it with important proteins called enzymes which keep the nectar fresh.
[27:32.39]When she is fully loaded with nectar, she returns to the hive where she pours out the enzyme-rich nectar into a small waxed cell.
[27:39.84]We call these waxed cells the honeycomb.
[27:43.24]because the hives are warm a constant 95 degrees fahrenheit the water heats up in the nectar and evaporates what we're left with is sweet honey okay now let's see how well you were able to remember the facts and be sure to count how many you got right where does the worker bee get the nectar from a flower the fridge or rotten fruit I don't know the answer is a flower
[28:07.89]In the honey stomach, the nectar is mixed with proteins called bee juice, honey mix, or enzymes.
[28:15.40]The answer is enzymes.
[28:18.78]And finally, beeswax, pollen, or water.
[28:20.22]The answer is water.
[28:20.62]So, how did you do?
[28:21.20]Honey was a pretty sticky topic, eh?
[28:33.09]okay so I'm a cardboard anchor and not a cardboard comedian so sue me well that's all the time we have for today but remember don't ever let anything distract you from watching distraction news so long this has been oh my god

[47:33.03]What about copyright?
[47:34.47]Let's go over copyright real quick.
[47:37.17]So, one of the things we want to make sure is that we add a very, very transformative material.
[47:43.83]These are obviously parodies and satires of these movies.
[47:47.51]So, trying to get as close to fair use as we can, obviously.
[47:53.26]Very, very transformed media.
[47:55.62]This is not a typical Lord of the Rings, okay?
[48:02.53]This is called Jerma Noir, Murder on 985 Street.

[48:40.06]How are you?

[67:52.21]Hey, Jerma985 here.
[67:53.07]Dude, Jerma.
[67:58.17]Real Jerma.
[67:58.85]Real Jerma.
[67:59.77]Real Jerma.
[68:01.57]Let's get this in plaster out of here.
[68:03.25]Ted Jerma.
[68:03.93]Ted Jerma.
[68:04.69]Hey, in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
[68:08.07]Do the thing.
[68:08.58]Do the thing.
[68:10.88]Oh, by the way, I think it's a good time to bring this up.
[68:14.32]So somebody had a submission to Green Screen Movie Night.
[68:17.16]And they were like, oh, is this okay?
[68:19.60]And we're like, oh, yeah.
[68:21.18]I was contacted by one of the mods that said, hey, so somebody made this green screen edit.
[68:28.61]It's way longer than three minutes.
[68:31.83]It's, in fact, the entire movie, The Truman Show, the whole runtime of the entire film.
[68:38.69]But you are replaced in every single scene.
[68:41.82]And it's like, well, no, we can't do that, first of all.
[68:48.51]First of all, I can't do that.
[68:50.17]And second of all, why?
[68:53.18]Why the whole movie?
[68:56.11]Um, the, the, my favorite part about it though, is there, there was a back and forth where it was just like, Hey, it's just like, I mean, I kind of went a little overboard or something.
[69:06.02]Right.
[69:06.20]It's like, yeah, it's, it's the whole movie, dude.
[69:14.41]I am, I don't want to talk.
[69:15.81]I obviously I'm not, I cannot show an entire movie here.
[69:19.49]Right.
[69:20.53]But that's all I'm going to say.
[69:22.47]It's that's hilarious.
[69:23.65]It's absolutely hilarious.
[69:30.59]Let me just take one second.
[69:32.27]I got to make sure that we have the right amount of movies left.
[69:38.04]I can confirm.
[69:38.90]Yes, Grump is DMing me.
[69:40.84]That is correct.
[69:45.26]Correct number of videos.
[69:48.26]Oh, man, but that's so funny.
[69:51.08]Okay, so here we go.
[69:51.74]Jerma Psychotic Adventures in The Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
[69:55.27]Here we go.
[69:56.81]Oh, Oblivion.
[69:57.47]Okay.
[70:07.53]We can start.
[70:13.10]Hey, wood elf.
[70:14.98]You're a little far from the forest, huh?
[70:17.32]Looks like your days of woodland frolicking have come to a trek to go from the gladed realm of Valenwood to a rat-infested hole like this.
[70:27.66]How very sad.
[70:29.02]Those walls must feel like they're closing in.
[70:33.30]Pretty soon, you'll go mad.
[70:35.38]Stay put, prisoner.
[70:36.86]I've never played Oblivion.
[70:38.60]I don't know how this works.
[70:40.60]I've never played one minute of Oblivion.
[70:56.43]And the stars were right.
[70:58.69]This is the day.
[71:01.23]Gods give me strength.
[71:18.77]He hit me like three times.
[71:24.55]Fiiiiii- aaaahhh- oooh.
[71:27.35]Wow, you're the grand champion.
[71:28.53]Can I, can I follow you around?
[71:30.71]I won't get in the way.
[71:32.89]I'm crazy or not, right?
[71:35.59]This is two, this is two left hands.
[71:37.91]Die, you motherfucker!
[71:39.75]Ooh, I'm choking.
[71:41.87]Stop!
[71:42.21]What'd he do?
[71:53.14]Stop criminal scum, right?
[71:54.91]Stop right there, criminal scum.
[71:56.79]Is it stop criminal scum?
[71:59.03]Stop!
[71:59.99]You violated the law.
[72:01.27]Stop you violated... Okay, you violated the law.
[72:03.67]Stop right there, criminal scum.
[72:05.71]Stop!
[72:06.55]Criminal scum.
[72:07.55]You violated the law.
[72:09.18]You violated the law.
[72:10.82]Now pay your fine, or it's off to jail.
[72:14.26]You will pay in blood.
[72:15.96]Then pay with your blood.
[72:18.10]Mocking him.
[72:19.74]Oh!
[72:22.32]Stop!
[72:23.92]Stop!
[72:25.10]Stop!
[72:26.54]Stop!
[72:27.45]What little patience I have is wearing thin.
[72:31.19]Stop!
[72:32.49]Stop!
[72:33.21]I have no time for mindless blather.
[72:40.04]Looks like you are in some trouble.
[72:46.74]Don't worry.
[72:47.48]I'll look the other way and take care of that fine for you.
[72:55.12]Now that you've given us a taste, the world is going to want more.
[73:00.34]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[73:01.58]That's what I hear.
[73:02.66]Shut up.
[73:04.14]Shut up.
[73:06.60]Yeah, yeah.
[73:07.58]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[73:08.42]Shut the fuck up.
[73:10.64]Stupid.
[73:11.06]You're all stupid idiots.
[73:14.17]You're dumb.
[73:15.65]You're the dumbest one here.
[73:17.49]Yeah.
[73:20.01]No, no, no, no.
[73:20.85]Turn that off.
[73:22.07]Sashay, away.
[73:31.46]Jerma, the driving instructor.
[73:33.14]Hold on, this is a real one.
[73:34.18]This one's filmed in real life, by the way.
[73:36.14]We got another real one.
[73:39.37]Jerma, the driving instructor.
[73:45.81]Could you pull this way and park for me, please?
[73:48.33]Over here, parallel park in this spot right here.
[73:50.25]There's two spots available.
[73:51.47]Not the one in front of the red truck.
[73:52.93]The one behind it.
[73:54.91]Behind the red truck.
[73:57.23]Use your eyes.
[74:00.13]You screwed that up.
[74:01.20]What you needed to do there is you had to... Not happy about it.
[74:08.16]Very much.
[74:08.64]I'm trying.
[74:14.81]You just hit it.
[74:16.37]You hit it.
[74:17.11]You bumped his bumper.
[74:18.65]You're not getting your license today, by the way.
[74:20.99]Make that very clear.
[74:23.10]What I have here is I have two bumped cars.
[74:26.88]I have, would you like to see the notes?
[74:29.38]You can see it if you want.
[74:30.26]Would you like to see what I've written down?
[74:31.46]Go ahead and look.
[74:34.07]You bumped a car.
[74:35.73]You couldn't go more than, you went 40, 50 miles per hour getting on the on-ramp to the highway.
[74:39.95]And not only that, you don't know how to parallel park.
[74:42.95]And guess what?
[74:43.66]I don't either.
[74:44.16]Am I on the right side here?
[74:47.70]Yes.
[74:49.53]You're pretty dumb.
[74:50.79]Can I just tell you?
[74:51.99]You're dumb.
[74:52.33]Do you want me to stop?
[74:53.97]No human drives a car like this.
[74:56.23]No human.
[74:57.35]You could get a chimpanzee in this car, and you'd probably do better than the test than you do.
[75:00.09]OK.
[75:01.01]Jack, you could get an armadillo to do this test, and it probably would do better than you just did.
[75:04.83]OK, enough.
[75:05.05]You could get an ant.
[75:05.87]You give me an army of ants and get them up to the wheel, 4,000 or 5,000 ants, and I could train them to do a better parallel parking jump than you.
[75:12.93]You don't think I could do that?
[75:14.81]You don't think I could train ants to do that?
[75:17.06]What's that?
[75:17.34]You don't think I'm smart enough to train ants?
[75:19.02]They'd be running circles around you, by the way.
[75:22.76]This is ridiculous.
[75:25.18]Stop sign.
[75:26.07]Stop sign.
[75:26.85]Stop sign.
[75:27.57]Stop sign.
[75:28.27]Stop sign.
[75:28.93]Stop sign.
[75:29.57]Stop sign.
[75:31.29]Do you see what's in front of us?
[75:32.37]You do, right?
[75:33.71]What's in front of us?
[75:34.45]It's a stop sign.
[75:35.47]Stop sign.
[75:36.05]Stop sign.
[75:36.57]Stop sign.
[75:37.17]Stop sign.
[75:39.97]Keep going.
[75:42.35]Now what I want you to do is I want you to pull that McDonald's.
[75:47.75]Very important part of your test.
[75:48.79]Driving through a drive-through is actually very hard.
[75:51.45]It's a very narrow road.
[75:52.77]It's a very narrow part of... It's hard to kind of navigate in there.
[75:56.97]Stop.
[75:57.27]Throw your window down.
[76:02.45]Get out of the way.
[76:04.12]Yeah, I'll take two double cheeseburgers, three McChickens, and a small drink.
[76:14.90]By the way, they rented my sauce.
[76:16.84]They rented my sauce.
[76:17.86]My Szechuan sauce.
[76:19.12]That's all going on your record here.
[76:22.14]This is fucking crazy.
[76:23.54]Hey, howdy.
[76:24.30]How are you?
[76:24.74]Thank you.
[76:25.62]Yep, I'll take it.
[76:26.48]Thank you.
[76:27.54]Can you put it over here?
[76:31.23]That was seriously unbelievable.
[76:37.53]God, that's so fucking funny.
[76:45.05]The fact that you... Because the funniest part about that is that dude's just kind of driving around and just reacting to this weird guy in his passenger side, right?
[76:57.77]That's acting right there.
[77:00.54]God, that was funny.
[77:01.16]Alright, this is Jeremy.
[77:02.82]Here's again.
[77:07.35]Hello, I'm John Lugami from Lugathis News Network.
[77:11.13]In a previous exclusive, we shared the heartwarming story of Jeremy Elbertson, a man who had shown us his first time hearing in over 30 years.
[77:19.48]Half a year later, we caught up with Jeremy to see what he's been doing since then.
[77:23.79]We set up an online interview to get a glimpse into the life of a born-again man.
[77:28.75]Thank you for being with us today, Jeremy.
[77:30.33]Thanks for having me!
[77:30.99]What the fuck?
[77:31.69]It seems there's connection issues, but that's okay.
[77:34.13]Since regaining his hearing, Jeremy has been working in numerous television roles, such as charity work for drug awareness campaigns... But let me just be the first to tell you that, you know, it's not fun.
[77:42.74]What is not totally byahoo?
[77:46.46]Drugs and alcohol.
[77:48.98]Stay away from them.
[77:50.88]...as well as AMC's hit series, Better Call Saul.
[77:57.03]Better call Saul.
[77:57.73]Spoilers potentially ahead.
[78:03.93]I need a little more.
[78:05.89]Pat, pass me the salt, please.
[78:09.69]Thank you.
[78:14.50]Very good.
[78:15.22]That's a patty.
[78:17.34]Two chops coming up.
[78:18.16]Two chops.
[78:19.04]He's even auditioned for the next Spider-Man trilogy featuring Spider-Man and series newcomer Michael Morbius.
[78:25.88]Oh, God.
[78:29.32]It's warping time.
[78:33.38]Let's go.
[78:37.60]Jeremy has been a patron of the local arts, performing at open mic nights, teaching upcoming stars his knowledge.
[78:43.90]He's displayed talents in magic.
[78:47.34]It's the Joker.
[78:50.58]Bingo.
[78:50.96]Here's your card.
[79:00.71]Thank you.
[79:01.51]And show tunes.
[79:12.17]It seems Jeremy has been busy these last few months, engoodening the lives of others.
[79:16.63]We asked Jeremy how we too can engooden lives, and he left us with this advice.
[79:21.82]If you're not feeling great, but you can make somebody else, you know that you can make somebody else feel good, and be like happy, do it.
[79:29.72]Wow, inspiring.
[79:31.08]I'm John Lugami, and this has been a Lugadis News Exclusive.
[79:36.29]Thank you for watching.
[79:42.76]Aw.
[79:44.86]With the first table already seated, Rachel seems agitated.
[79:48.33]He's not ready.
[79:49.41]And there's hardly anything on the menu, so.
[79:51.55]He's not ready.
[79:52.05]I've never seen anything like this.
[79:53.23]I've not seen anything like this.
[79:55.47]I only know how to make risotto.
[79:56.97]Besides that, I don't know.
[79:58.33]It's burning.
[79:59.83]You like to talk like you know food, but you actually really don't.
[80:02.61]Oh, he's very angry.
[80:03.63]Yeah.
[80:04.19]Oh, yeah.
[80:04.73]Shia, Shia, he's angry.
[80:06.33]Welcome to the madhouse.
[80:07.63]Stupid.
[80:08.07]You're all stupid idiots.
[80:11.14]You're dumb.
[80:12.62]You're the dumbest one here.
[80:15.52]Is this normal?
[80:17.95]Yes.
[80:18.55]It's very hard to control them and that is a problem.
[80:22.57]This nut has lost his marbles.
[80:24.61]This is so sad, do you know that?
[80:27.19]Coffee!
[80:27.75]Coffee?
[80:28.21]Anyone want some coffee?
[80:30.00]Hey, coffee!
[80:30.86]When do I get paid?
[80:31.72]Who wants coffee?
[80:33.10]Let's go.
[80:33.50]What's the matter?
[80:34.34]Let go.
[80:34.84]You will pay in blood.
[80:38.14]Let me in!
[80:38.54]Let me in!
[80:39.40]Fuck, mate.
[80:39.98]Let me in!
[80:42.49]It looks like I'm going to have to take Jermad to the nut house myself.
[80:47.04]What the fuck?
[80:50.38]It's a Goo Goo Nest ad.
[80:52.30]Morbid!
[80:56.04]With the Goo Goo Nest doorbell, know if it's a Psycho, Morbius, or Jerma.
[81:01.43]Security with Goo Goo Smarts on the Goo Goo Nest doorbell.
[81:05.29]You like drugs?
[81:08.66]Do you like drugs?
[81:09.80]I got a lot.
[81:10.94]Bleed.
[81:11.92]Coke.
[81:14.08]That's all I got.
[81:16.10]I don't got anything else, but you know, call me.
[81:22.34]Really, really beautiful lawn you have, too.
[81:24.84]Yeah.
[81:25.52]I got kids.
[81:26.24]Yeah, we all get kids, right?
[81:28.22]Look, if you ever, um... It might sound weird, but if you ever want to hang out... I've got paid either way.
[81:41.16]Oh my goodness.
[81:43.65]Okay.
[81:45.73]This is the J985 incident.
[81:48.43]My voice is already gone.
[81:49.73]It's only been an hour and a half.
[81:53.75]Okay, this is a scary one, I think.
[81:57.05]The J985 incident.
[81:59.91]Could be scary.
[82:06.62]We are currently receiving numerous reports of hostile activity around the country.
[82:11.53]A certain person has been seen near the places of the incidents.
[82:16.78]They are usually described as an usually short guy, psycho, or the sus guy.
[82:23.15]but do not be fooled by its appearance.
[82:25.85]In fact, it is an ancient entity of an unknown origin that has already been known to us, but recently has started growing its influence and is becoming aggressive.
[82:35.17]In the scientific community it is referred to as J985, J for its ever juvenile appearance and 985 being the year of its first occurrence.
[82:46.44]If you live within the highlighted area, please exert extra caution.
[82:56.27]Five, seven, seven.
[83:27.17]Hey, hey, what's up?
[83:28.11]How are you?
[83:28.95]I'm doing great.
[83:29.59]Yeah.
[83:30.45]I just moved in, yep.
[83:32.11]New to the neighborhood.
[83:33.13]Right.
[83:34.09]Look, if you ever, it might sound weird, but if you ever want to hang out and just kind of do something, just you and me or whatever.
[83:41.68]I don't care.
[83:42.07]Can I come in?
[83:42.99]Can I just come in?
[83:44.09]And we'll...
[83:45.43]Mmm, could get some mojitos.
[83:47.67]This is scary.
[83:48.11]I make an insane mojito.
[83:49.25]You don't understand.

[89:33.70]Hi, everyone.
[89:37.32]My name's Sean Elvington.
[89:42.26]I'm the actor, writer, director, producer, and main talent of the daytime television show Jigsaw Is Here.
[89:51.56]And it's something very important that we all have to do.
[89:54.10]We have to make choices.
[89:55.96]And one choice is for you to watch this show, because the ratings have been very poor.
[90:00.70]And I believe that we are below reruns of infomercials at this point.
[90:07.02]So I figured we could give you a quick little maybe you could watch the show if you want.
[90:12.11]For the 600 to 700 of you that do watch the show, thank you so much.
[90:16.91]It means a lot.
[90:18.91]And cast and crew, we have to put a lot of time into this show.
[90:21.82]so we'll get back to it let's get back to your regularly scheduled programming of big sauce coming for you written and directed starring and produced by me oh my god that was great how did he get in here oh beautiful beautiful beautiful work Jermaland a lost episode

[91:13.09]I'm literally just here trying to work.
[91:19.64]Why are you telling me this?
[91:22.40]Why are you telling me this?

[94:02.81]Real game!
[94:03.59]What?!
[94:04.01]Holy shit, this is insane!
[94:34.32]We've seen a few games come through here.
[94:36.32]We've seen probably like five to ten games and they're all awesome.
[94:57.65]Damn.
[95:12.86]actually awesome.
[95:23.83]Thermos Big Adventure 2 now in development.
[95:34.74]Wow.
[95:40.38]Hell yeah.
[95:44.18]There's other games that I have not shown.
[95:46.36]It's just... Honestly, there's just so much... Wait a minute.
[96:06.09]What the hell was that?
[96:06.89]That was terrifying.
[96:11.70]But what I was going to say is...
[96:15.11]People in this community are so creative that so much shit like this comes out that it's just, it's just hard to even believe sometimes.
[96:25.36]So there's other, there's other games that have been in development that are kind of focused on the community that I have not even shown yet.
[96:31.50]I haven't, you haven't even seen it.
[96:34.98]Really, really cool.
[96:35.72]Really cool stuff.
[96:37.75]Uh, here comes Spider-Man 4 teaser trailer.
[96:39.69]Very real, emotional.
[96:42.43]This is going to be probably Spider-Man spoilers for the, you know, you know the deal.
[96:47.67]But I did put on the Spider-Man suit, so here we go.
[96:58.92]Hello again, Peter.
[97:02.64]It's me, Star.
[97:07.22]Six weeks ago, you had about 40.5 caps on it at the same time.
[97:12.26]And you crossed your computer.
[97:14.42]Here to tell you that you have a choice to make.
[97:16.60]And it's time for you to make it.
[97:21.41]Excuse me, fucking Peter Parker just showed up.
[97:24.59]Oh.
[97:24.83]You have an idea who you're dealing with?
[97:27.87]I'm Spider-Man.
[97:48.88]That's not pretty goblin.
[97:51.54]Who's that new man?
[98:10.53]There is nothing out there like the turbo clicker.
[98:13.27]Oh, I can't wait for this one.
[98:15.85]What I saw in that movie.
[98:18.33]right it saw I have to be in that movie hello again Peter oh man alright this is that was great that was hilarious Cathy Mitchell's turbo cooker featuring real testimonials okay let's go right because there's nothing out there like the turbo cooker we decided to give turbo cookers to a number of people to use in their own homes let's hear what they had to say
[98:42.86]I can take frozen meat out of the freezer, frozen vegetables out of the freezer, and have a meal ready in 15 or 20 minutes that's healthy, that's good, and that's good for me.
[98:53.83]You can really minimize the amount of oil that you use in cooking.
[98:57.71]Well, I mean, ever since I was on my own, I started to cook for myself ever since I was on my own.
[99:11.40]And I learned how to make mushroom risotto, and yeah.
[99:15.25]You get the properties of the frying, but yet you get this remarkable tenderness to the meat.
[99:21.79]I never thought that you could steam a cake on the top of the stove, and it turned out so moist, better than anything I've ever had.
[99:30.85]And that's what my mom taught me, you know?
[99:34.97]I call her every Sunday.
[99:37.93]It's just easier, it's much healthier, and it brings everything together.
[99:41.99]I like to be able to taste the food that you've just eaten and have that flavor come through.
[99:47.33]So I would much rather do it this way here than to use all that oil to cook it.
[99:51.38]I may have undercooked it a little.
[100:01.36]sorry I'm sorry kathy thank you thank you thank you for bringing us the turbo cooker this is great it's a complete system it's never going to leave our stovetops the incredible turbo cooker there is nothing out there like the turbo the whole point with these products is you can't it up you put a steak in and you come back in six minutes and it's done how you can't undercook something
[100:32.93]These things are foolproof.
[100:34.33]You can't mess it up.
[100:36.90]I may have undercooked a little.
[100:44.30]Oh, my God.
[100:46.34]Jesus Christ.
[100:48.29]Alright, let's keep going.
[100:50.43]This one is Spider-Man versus Jigsaw.
[100:55.27]Here we go.
[100:57.67]Oh.
[101:09.04]Hello again, Peter.
[101:10.22]It's me, Saw.
[101:16.54]You have an idea who you're dealing with?
[101:22.13]I'm Spider-Man.
[101:23.91]Six weeks ago, you had over 40 Pornhub tabs open at the same time.
[101:29.33]And you crashed your computer.
[101:32.05]So now, you have 40 computers with 40 different porn videos on them.
[101:38.88]40 separate pornography videos.
[101:41.56]You need to go and close them all.
[101:45.67]before the knock on the door of your mother finds you.
[101:50.53]You have one minute.
[101:51.63]One minute?
[101:52.45]Make your choice.
[101:53.05]I got one minute?
[101:54.95]Okay.
[101:55.11]Alright.
[101:55.75]I got one minute on the clock.
[101:56.65]I can do this.
[101:58.27]All these computers here?
[101:59.19]Okay.
[102:00.81]Alright.
[102:01.51]Now?
[102:02.02]What's going on now?
[102:08.70]Which one?
[102:09.08]Which one do I start with first?
[102:09.88]This one over here.
[102:11.08]I'm going to hack into that.
[102:11.95]Oh, by the way, Peter, I forgot to mention, I know you only have 45 seconds left.
[102:17.83]The room.
[102:23.01]Nerve gas.
[102:23.83]Got it, got it, got it, got it.
[102:25.33]Oh, I know nerve gas very well.
[102:27.37]I said nerve gas in Saw 1 through 5.
[102:31.88]Will you be able to succeed?
[102:33.90]I did what you wanted.
[102:35.34]I shut them all off.
[102:37.16]Oh, you did it.
[102:38.23]You did it.
[102:39.57]Hey, he did it.
[102:41.45]You actually did it.

[102:48.61]Go out the door.

[103:03.72]Wait, wait, wait.
[103:04.46]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[103:06.14]You didn't make your choice.
[103:07.70]Your choice is to be killed and... Dude, alright.
[103:15.66]I have a question.
[103:17.64]Why has nobody actually made it a lightsaber?
[103:19.98]It's just nobody has put the... the light blade at the end.
[103:23.74]It's just a stick.
[103:26.99]How did he get in there?
[103:30.19]He let... he opened the door.
[103:32.51]That's so ridiculous.

[119:41.19]I'm struggling to identify what the hell you're doing.
[119:43.91]I really am.
[119:46.25]It's Master Chef, not Master Bait.
[119:49.07]Hello, students.
[119:50.01]Welcome to the Defense of the Dark Arts class.
[119:55.43]My name is Lúcio Malfoy.
[119:58.45]I'm the new teacher in town.
[120:00.69]If you could all open up your textbooks and go to page 200, please.
[120:05.75]We're going to be using...
[120:08.01]Yes, yes.
[120:09.21]Ron, please.
[120:10.61]There's nothing in here about using defensive spells.
[120:14.43]Page 200, we're going to be making a frog breath potion.
[120:19.34]You know all about that, don't you, Harry?
[120:23.32]Open up your textbook.
[120:30.24]I'm in the middle of teaching, Harry.
[120:31.89]That's not the time to use that spell.
[120:34.33]Now, fuck you.
[120:36.05]You see what I got dealing with back here?
[120:43.34]Hello, boys and girls.
[120:45.12]It's-a me, Mario.
[120:47.24]Let me tell you something about drugs and alcohol.
[120:51.56]My brother Luigi.
[120:52.86]Pause.
[121:01.36]Okay, nobody used this for anything else besides what we're doing this for.
[121:05.83]There's no way anyone's gonna use this for anything else besides riding a fucking roller coaster.
[121:10.09]Alright, that's enough.
[121:19.36]Oh, alright.
[121:21.78]Let's take a quick two, three minute break.
[121:24.76]We're at the two hour mark.
[121:26.64]I'm going to take a look at the videos.
[121:27.80]We'll see how much we have left.
[121:28.83]I think we have another solid, probably at least two, three hours.
[121:32.31]Let's go pee.
[121:33.99]Go get another snack.
[121:35.25]Maybe I'll be back in about three minutes.
[121:38.03]See you guys in three to four, maybe ish minutes.

[127:15.79]My stomach hurts.
[127:21.33]My stomach hurts.

[127:37.00]Everyone good?
[127:37.96]Are we settled?
[127:43.89]That's also another reason why I mean, we can only really do this for four or five hours.
[127:50.75]You know what I mean?
[127:51.25]Because otherwise I'm going to die.
[127:52.69]I will literally die.
[127:56.78]So don't worry.
[127:58.54]We're going to do this another one or two more times and we'll get through these.
[128:02.30]I promise.
[128:05.94]Alright, you guys ready?
[128:10.27]Let's bring it back.

[139:11.40]King Andi's evil reign reaches far and wide.
[139:15.11]He has obliterated his entire bloodline for selfish gain, to be the true Jermite.
[139:21.59]But what he doesn't know is that there is one left of his kind.
[139:26.58]One who seeks revenge.
[139:32.52]I'm not scared though, are you scared?
[139:34.02]Yeah, I bet you are.
[139:35.50]Dark Souls.
[139:36.08]I bet you're scared.
[139:39.29]I'm not scared at all.
[139:42.93]Whoa, hey, hey.
[139:45.59]Hey, you can see the whole park from here, can you see?
[139:48.64]That's crazy.
[139:49.64]Hear thee, people of the Parklands.
[139:52.42]There is a dangerous creature stalking the caves.
[139:55.44]Who is brave enough to kill the monster?
[139:58.34]You there, Jermite.
[140:00.44]You seem ready for a quest.
[140:02.76]No, no, no, I'm sorry, no.
[140:04.65]I ain't gonna do it.
[140:05.67]Are you sure you don't want to kill the monster?
[140:08.41]No, fuck you.
[140:09.93]Fuck it, you see what I got dealing with back here?
[140:12.40]You think I'm going to do that shit?
[140:13.66]Well, this mission does progress the story.
[140:16.90]How?
[140:17.76]Well, I don't know.
[140:18.78]This is the starting mission.
[140:19.82]No, you do it.
[140:21.12]You go do it.
[140:21.98]You deal with this.
[140:22.98]I'm not dealing with that.
[140:23.74]What are you talking about?
[140:24.82]I may have caused it, but I'm not going to deal with it.
[140:26.30]You are.
[140:26.60]Wait a minute.
[140:27.18]You put the monster in the cave that's killed thousands of children?
[140:30.99]Yes.
[140:33.55]Jesus Christ.
[140:34.83]Hey, how much?
[140:36.55]Look, I'll just give you a potion.
[140:37.75]Can you please kill the monster?
[140:39.27]Yes.
[140:39.97]I can tolerate them when they're in small doses.
[140:41.93]Whatever, just take the potion, man.
[140:43.73]Thank you.
[140:54.36]No.
[140:59.62]No.
[141:00.76]Absolutely not.
[141:01.62]I want everyone to understand that the King made a lot of good things happen today, don't you think?
[141:11.57]You little jester over there, you're so funny.
[141:14.04]How do I do it?
[141:15.22]I made things happen.
[141:16.60]I raised taxes on everybody.
[141:18.08]How many people did we kill today?
[141:19.10]60?
[141:20.06]Yeah, that's a lot.
[141:21.70]What's that?
[141:23.10]What'd you say?
[141:23.56]Okay.
[141:26.18]Feed him to a lion.
[141:30.01]Though Jerma's revenge on King Andy was sweet, he made one fatal error in skipping the first mission the Jermonster made its way to Jerma and hit him over the head with a big wooden mallet, marking the end of the Jermite bloodline and paving way for the destruction of the world.
[141:53.66]Oh, damn.
[141:54.12]Terrifying moments for a downtown Las Vegas homeowner who posted this video on social media showing this suspect making threats.
[142:01.39]The homeowner, who we won't be identifying, posted this on social media and asked her followers to share the video widely so people could be aware that the man is out there.
[142:11.47]At first, you can see the man just not making much sense, repeating himself.
[142:16.65]I'd love to come in.
[142:18.55]Could I come in?
[142:19.93]Could I come in your house?
[142:21.79]Can I come in?
[142:22.45]Yeah, let me.
[142:23.65]Can I come in?
[142:25.37]Let me in.

[145:46.48]He splashed me with water.
[145:48.66]Don't splash me.
[145:49.64]Splashing.
[145:50.04]You can't splash here.
[145:51.16]It says it on the sign before we walked in.
[145:53.70]Don't splash people.
[145:55.09]They don't want to splash you.

[147:23.92]Jesus.
[147:27.04]Mario tells... Is this it here?
[147:30.56]Oh, Bowser.
[147:36.94]Oh, boys and girls.
[147:39.30]It's-a me, Mario.
[147:41.73]Let me tell you something.
[147:43.67]If somebody want to tell you to take drugs, always say no.
[147:48.86]You see, Luigi tried to drink and do drugs one time, and I said, no.
[147:54.62]And he said, Mario.
[147:55.92]And I said, no.
[148:00.81]Let me tell you something about drugs.
[148:03.11]Oh, no.
[148:04.71]You should never take any drugs.
[148:07.05]Never.
[148:07.43]Mario wouldn't.
[148:08.63]Luigi wouldn't.
[148:09.69]Toad?
[148:10.05]Maybe.
[148:12.27]Get the fuck out of here.
[148:16.76]Sit the fuck down, Bowser.
[148:20.66]Whoa!
[148:20.96]Bowser!
[148:30.85]Hello, boys.
[148:36.07]It's so stupid.

[148:42.06]Come on and everyone go do the Mario.
[148:47.56]Hello.
[148:52.63]Okay, you can do this, Mario.
[148:54.55]You can do this, Mario.
[148:56.79]It's a me, Mario.
[148:58.89]Let me tell you something about drugs and alcohol.
[149:03.24]My brother Luigi would also say this to me.
[149:05.96]We both would say this.
[149:09.06]Shit!
[149:13.20]No.
[149:14.60]No.
[149:15.76]How do you do it?
[149:17.14]No.

[149:23.44]She was.
[149:24.52]I saw you laughing in the corner.
[149:26.38]What's wrong?
[149:27.83]What's wrong?
[149:28.91]Just cut them together, okay?
[149:29.55]I'm fucking done with this job.
[149:52.18]Hello, it's-a me, Mario.
[149:54.72]I want to talk to you about drugs.
[149:56.96]Boys and girls, don't do drugs.
[149:59.26]You don't have to do them.
[150:00.48]Don't feel pressured to take drugs or drink.
[150:03.35]If anyone ever pressures you, tell them Mario said, so long, King Bowser, and they will leave you alone.
[150:09.87]No!
[150:13.01]Hello, it's-a me, Mario.
[150:15.72]I have to do a drug PSA.
[150:17.92]Okay, I'm done.
[150:22.03]Jesus.
[150:22.95]Hmm.
[150:24.83]I see.
[150:26.51]That's a wise decision.
[150:45.87]I can't wait any longer.
[151:03.95]Oh, shit.
[151:15.12]Holy shit, that was good.
[151:17.88]Tell me the duck story.
[151:19.54]The duck story?
[151:22.52]A duck walked up to a lemonade stand and he said to the man running the stand, Hey, got any grapes?
[151:32.55]The man said,

[151:40.10]Then he waddled away.
[151:41.46]Oh my God.

[202:37.35]Good show.
[202:46.68]What you need to do is you need to relax.
[202:48.52]You need to get a step on that gas.
[202:55.25]You screwed that up.
[202:57.37]What you needed to do there is you had to... I'm not happy about it.
[203:04.33]Very much unhappy about that.
[203:09.36]You're pretty dumb.
[203:10.64]Can I just tell you?
[203:11.84]You're dumb.
[203:13.81]No human drives a car like this.
[203:16.05]No human.
[203:17.19]You could get a chimpanzee in this car and you'd probably do better than the test than you did.
[203:20.71]Do you see what's in front of us?
[203:21.77]You do, right?
[203:23.11]What's in front of us?
[203:24.85]Stop sign, stop sign, stop sign, stop sign.
[203:29.38]Keep going.
[203:30.82]Over here, parallel park in this spot right here.
[203:32.68]There's two spots available.
[203:33.98]Not the one in front of the red truck.
[203:35.36]The one behind it.
[203:37.64]Behind the red truck.
[203:39.66]Use your eyes.
[203:41.76]Do you want these?
[203:43.99]right there, parallel park, behind the red truck.
[203:47.13]I'm not going to say it another time.
[203:48.95]Get up there and parallel park.
[203:53.68]You just hit it.
[203:55.24]You hit it.
[203:55.98]You bumped his bumper.
[203:57.24]Okay.
[203:59.76]That's going to get you two grades off, I think.
[204:01.92]You're not getting your license today, by the way.
[204:04.26]Make that very clear.
[204:06.43]We sat down?
[204:10.37]My name is
[204:12.98]Sean, okay?
[204:15.54]That's what you can call me now.
[204:16.82]Not angry mustache guy that you see on YouTube.
[204:22.08]Sean.
[204:23.54]I'm very sorry.
[204:24.72]I'm incredibly sorry.
[204:26.11]You want more than that?
[204:29.67]That's all I'm going to give you.
[204:31.69]I'm going to go back to being a good person.
[204:33.95]You just wait.
[204:35.35]Good person Sean is what you'll call me.
[204:37.65]Not this.
[204:38.23]I'm shaving this.
[204:39.11]Good person Sean is coming up.
[204:48.48]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[204:49.74]That's what I hear.
[204:50.82]Shut up.
[204:52.30]Shut up.
[204:53.80]Yeah, yeah.
[204:54.74]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[204:55.62]Shut the fuck up.
[204:57.89]Stupid.
[204:58.29]You're all stupid idiots.
[205:01.35]You're dumb.
[205:02.51]You're the dumbest one here.
[205:04.35]Yeah.
[205:06.75]No, no, no, no.
[205:07.43]Get the... Turn that off.
[205:08.59]Turn that off.
[205:09.11]I'm Shane Shawn, goddammit.
[205:10.47]No, I'm a different person now.
[205:11.73]Turn that camera off.
[205:15.20]Somebody used it.
[205:16.12]Somebody actually used it.
[205:51.90]Dude, I just got a warning on my Twitch dashboard that said there's a copyrighted song.
[205:57.63]That's what triggered it?
[205:58.85]This whole stream?
[206:23.68]Oh my god.
[206:28.30]Alright, time for another pee break.
[206:30.86]I'm going to get a drink.
[206:31.48]I'll be back in like two minutes, three minutes.
[206:35.38]I think we are, we're getting close to a little bit more than the halfway point.
[206:39.52]I think a little bit more than that.
[206:41.76]I want to see how many we have left.
[206:45.18]My whole body hurts, by the way.
[206:53.29]Let's see.
[206:53.93]No spoilers.
[206:54.71]No spoilers.
[206:59.49]So we have crossed the halfway point.
[207:02.81]And we've got a solid another probably hour or two left.
[207:15.42]This has been absolutely hysterical, though.
[207:17.36]These have been some of the highest quality things we've seen so far.
[207:22.59]At least in the last three or four years.
[207:26.16]My whole body is aching.
[207:27.42]My face hurts.
[207:30.85]Real voice.
[207:31.55]Alright, I'll be right back.
[207:33.27]Give me like two minutes, three minutes.
[213:57.62]Okay, we're back.
[213:59.24]So we're gonna, I'm probably gonna go for like another hour.
[214:02.60]Hour and 25 minutes, maybe.
[214:04.14]Do we like another 30, 40?
[214:07.19]Oh, there's so much here.
[214:11.23]I'm definitely hitting that point where I've been laughing and fucking just choking back here.
[214:18.19]For the last three and a half hours.
[214:19.99]God.
[214:21.85]Okay.
[214:22.95]Let's go to the home stretch.
[214:24.63]It will be a part two.
[214:25.79]Don't worry.
[214:27.90]There were 800 videos, guys, and we're not going to show them all, but we'll absolutely get through at least 200, 300, 400 of these, I would imagine.
[214:39.73]There's just too much good content.
[214:42.48]Okay.
[214:45.74]Let's get back to it.
[214:50.62]I just double-tapped the screen to skip the pee break.
[214:58.39]Alright, let's keep going.
[215:00.17]Let's get another solid hour or two in here.
[215:11.14]Here we go.
[215:12.64]Next one coming up is Jerma's new CSGO tactic.
[215:17.94]Counter-terrorists win.
[215:25.28]Good day.
[215:26.76]Come on, everybody, gather around.
[215:28.14]Alright, here we go.
[215:32.08]Just rush.
[215:32.98]B. All together now, all of us.
[215:37.25]No way.
[215:37.87]Oh, yes.
[215:41.81]I've told you guys this before.
[215:42.87]Absolute perfection.
[215:43.61]No ifs, ands, or buts.
[215:55.87]Hey, hey, hey!
[216:39.23]Oh, you want to fight?
[216:40.01]You want to fight?
[216:40.75]Don't fuck with that.
[216:41.65]On the count of three, we're all going to put our guns down.
[216:56.83]That's stupid.
[216:57.37]You think you can do me?
[216:58.65]That's stupid.
[217:24.16]There's somebody got banned.
[217:30.84]Bomb has been planted.
[217:50.85]Alright.
[217:52.81]Where is it?
[217:59.38]It's not there.
[218:00.42]Where is it?
[218:06.58]I got alerted.
[218:12.50]Terrorists win.
[218:14.73]I love this part.
[218:15.45]Coming up here.
[218:17.55]We need 10 seconds after that one.
[218:24.59]God.
[218:37.45]That was very, very good.
[218:39.97]Job well done.
[218:40.61]That was very, very fun.
[218:44.61]Okay, this is Super Jerma Rumble Melee.
[218:47.11]Let's check it out.
[218:54.10]Thank you.
[219:22.59]Burn it!
[219:23.59]Burn it!
[220:21.96]This is terrible.
[220:23.22]No, it was not.
[220:24.12]Imagine an earwig looking up at you, and he's like... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[220:31.78]Everybody hold on a second.
[220:33.80]This... Didn't we...
[220:36.45]Talk about this, like, three days ago?
[220:39.49]Like, four days ago?
[220:43.36]Did you do this in one day?
[220:46.42]One day?
[220:47.52]At the deadline?
[220:51.06]Holy shit.
[220:52.66]What?
[220:53.36]You did this in, like, four hours?
[220:56.73]Okay.
[220:57.49]Well, let's go.
[220:58.07]I see an earwig looking up at you, and he's like,
[221:06.58]And I'm like, oh, get the envelope!
[221:08.32]Save him!
[221:09.46]And I get the envelope, and I put, and I'll get him on the envelope, and I put him outside.
[221:12.46]And then the next day, it's like three that you see.
[221:15.02]And you're like, oh, wow, cool, let's save these three!
[221:18.51]To the same fucking soundtrack.
[221:23.55]Oh, save us!
[221:25.93]You're coming out of 50 in your house!
[221:29.30]And they're all dancing in a line, doing one antenna, two antenna, one antenna, two antenna, top hat, top hat, top hat.
[221:36.44]It's like, well, 50 earwigs.
[221:37.72]Oh my God, they're so cute.
[221:39.08]Get the envelope.
[221:40.40]They all start crawling on it.
[221:41.64]You get them out, you save them, save the earwigs.
[221:45.28]And then me lying down in bed three days later, drifting off to sleep.
[221:51.58]Ah, what a nice day that was today.
[221:55.37]And the second that I fall asleep and I go into REM, they can sense it.
[221:59.66]And 2,000 earwigs just make a trail up the bed and just go into my brain to this music.
[222:06.00]And they're all going in, digging in, like eating pieces of my brain matter.
[222:11.34]And I'm just asleep.
[222:13.93]And some of them are still dancing with the top hat.
[222:19.33]I love earwigs.
[222:25.29]How did you do that in like a day?
[222:30.88]That was awesome.
[222:32.46]Okay, Jerma owes the precious two point, oh God.
[222:36.18]I hate this fucking image.
[222:37.58]That's the image that pops up.
[222:38.94]It's just so ugly.
[222:39.80]Link that image off the internet.
[222:41.14]One, two, three, one, two, three.
[222:42.74]One, two, three, one, two, three.
[222:44.52]One, two, three, one, two, three.
[222:46.20]See, goal, play.
[222:52.47]Minus 50!
[222:52.81]Oh, item!
[223:10.39]Oh, Otto!
[223:10.39]Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[223:20.00]I don't zerk off in a box.
[223:25.39]That sounded like a fast one.
[223:26.21]Despite, despite, despite, despite. Yeah boy, yeah boy, yeah boy, yeah boy. Horse horse horse horse.
[223:36.21]Worst stream of the year.
[223:53.12]Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, y, y ,y?
[224:24.40]Just wait, just wait, just wait, just wait...
[224:32.06]I don't.
[224:32.34]What do we got going on next?
[224:36.24]Oh, another chair sitter.
[224:38.49]Don't call them chair sitters.
[224:39.93]That's bullshit.
[224:41.21]They're a musician.
[224:42.67]I'm just going to sit on my chair.
[224:44.03]Don't streamers.
[224:47.37]You probably all just heard that.
[224:48.39]That's fine.
[224:48.98]Don't listen to that.
[224:49.72]You know, I'm actually named after a penis myself.
[224:52.28]What are you playing?
[224:53.62]Alright.
[224:53.84]Yeah, we're going to play a new song.
[224:54.94]This one is something we've been working on for a long time.
[224:57.48]I hope you all enjoy it.
[225:00.13]Well, go ahead, please.
[225:01.45]We're really excited to see your piano work.
[225:04.12]And a one, two, a one, two, three, four.
[225:33.74]Did you get that accurate?
[225:39.10]Thank you.
[225:40.54]Thank you so much.
[226:05.88]I don't.
[226:06.36]Listen, I'm the only one that didn't say no.
[226:08.98]I thought that was phenomenal.
[226:10.02]I thought you did a great job.
[226:11.04]I don't.
[226:11.34]Wow.
[226:11.78]I don't.
[226:12.04]Thank you.
[226:12.34]Listen to any of these jokers.
[226:14.28]I thought that was great.
[226:14.96]We've been working on that for like, what, two weeks, three weeks now.
[226:17.76]Well, actually, my problem was it was a bit too fast.
[226:22.33]You see, for Elise was written for Elise.
[226:25.29]And it was actually really supposed to be a tender, loving song that picked up at times like the heights of relationships, but also slowed down like the lows.
[226:33.03]Right.
[226:33.43]And I didn't feel the passion come through, although the notes did.
[226:36.62]right it's not good he's got a point number 14 yeah that was a phenomenal phenomenal time on the piano but after hearing what do you mean it's not good judges I only know what video game music is what do you got well I mean I I just don't really listen to it I thought that was quite lovely it's perfect number 14 I'm so sorry
[227:02.72]You got a great look.
[227:03.88]I think you look at the great look you got to look at the part Apparently having a piano is an automatic no from like two people, but I don't want you to quit.
[227:11.72]Okay, what is it?
[227:12.56]Shut up Yeah, oh yeah, yeah shut the fuck up

[236:49.58]What a real piece of work you are, huh?
[236:51.83]Oh, you created everybody.
[236:53.13]Did you though?
[236:55.05]Sure it wasn't me.
[236:56.81]I could have been up there.
[236:57.91]I could have been up there and I could have done it.
[236:59.65]Forget you, G.O.D.
[237:04.65]They hurt my head.
[237:05.49]My head hurts.

[237:55.79]That's awesome that you guys are here.
[237:57.89]Do you guys come here a lot?
[238:00.55]Maybe like once every few months?
[238:02.07]That's cool.
[238:02.91]Can I talk in the mic?
[238:03.65]No?
[238:03.89]Alright, I don't need to.
[238:04.95]Can I talk?
[238:08.14]What is happening?
[238:09.21]They've gotten more unhinged as the night has gone on.
[238:12.05]I hope so.
[238:12.49]I'll be okay with McDonald's, too.
[238:14.03]Not on PlayStation.
[238:36.57]Alright, now what?
[238:37.09]They've gotten weirder.
[238:38.07]You can just take this whole thing.
[238:40.01]Go ahead.
[238:46.96]Alright.
[238:48.48]Okay, everybody settle down.
[238:51.64]Settle down.
[238:59.77]Hello.
[239:01.95]Yeah, and guess what?
[239:03.09]You can hear me, huh?
[239:04.47]You can hear me pretty well.
[239:06.24]Not like it was before.
[239:10.18]What the fuck, dude?
[239:11.52]I'm not going to drink it.
[239:12.90]Hold on.
[239:16.96]You guys are killing me.
[239:20.11]Hey.
[239:20.19]How you doing?
[239:22.95]So not like it was before, right?
[239:24.69]You can actually hear me talking.
[239:25.91]I've got a little clip here.
[239:27.31]Hi.
[239:29.81]Previous times I've been in front of the green screen, you couldn't hear a single goddamn thing I was saying.
[239:35.59]Not this time.
[239:36.41]Now you can hear me.
[239:37.96]And by the way, we're in full 60 FPS.
[239:43.74]Not 30.
[239:44.60]Not the 30 bullshit.
[239:45.84]This is 60 FPS.
[239:47.66]And I got a lav microphone.
[239:50.05]And I hope it works.
[239:51.13]Because if it doesn't, then we're in big fucking trouble.
[239:55.45]Oh shit, I got a tweet.
[239:58.69]Does everybody hold on?
[239:59.43]Hang tight.
[240:01.78]So you can hear her?
[240:05.35]Alright.
[240:06.37]I need to test this shit because I have no idea how this sounds.
[240:11.36]I literally got these microphones like a day ago.
[240:14.62]They were awesome.
[240:15.12]Not even 24 hours ago.
[240:15.84]They actually worked really well.
[240:17.50]If these things work, this company is getting a major shout out.
[240:20.63]Road wireless.
[240:21.19]Huge shout out.
[240:22.11]Road go.
[240:22.73]Wireless too.
[240:23.53]I mean, they were fantastic.
[240:24.23]And by the way, high quality camera this time too.
[240:28.99]Genuinely, I mean that.
[240:31.02]High quality camera.
[240:34.24]Does it sound good?
[240:34.82]Alright, hold on.
[240:38.27]Let me just tweet that.
[240:40.85]How long is this fucking?
[240:42.15]Yeah, so hopefully it sounds alright.
[240:44.63]These things are pretty cool.
[240:46.91]Let me try a scream test.
[240:47.79]Can I try it?
[240:48.69]Hold on.
[240:50.11]Can I scream?
[240:50.85]Can I scream in your ears?
[240:51.91]I'm going to scream in your ears.
[240:52.71]Dude.
[240:54.71]Seriously, I'm going to scream in your ears, and let me know how it is.
[240:58.25]Ready?
[240:59.81]Why would I not do this in front of the green screen?
[241:01.11]Alright, ready?
[241:04.66]This is an audio test.
[241:07.14]What's up?
[241:08.56]Audio test.
[241:09.94]Testing the audio.
[241:11.86]I'm going to scream, so turn down your volume.
[241:13.86]I'm being dead serious.
[241:17.03]Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[241:19.65]That was probably horrible.
[241:21.25]I just got these microphones like fucking a day ago.
[241:25.50]Is it bad?
[241:26.08]Is it OK?
[241:29.77]I mean, we're peaking, but is it alright?
[241:31.53]Oh my god, dude.
[241:32.81]Come on.
[241:34.21]Come on.
[241:35.11]You should smoke cigarettes.
[241:36.11]I'm not going to smoke a cigarette.
[241:40.68]Is it OK?
[241:42.94]Dude, you .
[241:45.12]God damn it.
[242:00.51]This hurts.
[242:04.43]The only thing you did.
[242:05.78]Oh, you motherfucker.
[242:12.86]None of that is usable.
[242:18.74]Who's he talking to?
[242:21.02]So Mario can come off?
[242:23.70]Dog, dog.
[242:24.48]I'll take a fucking dog.
[242:26.03]What's that?
[242:26.43]Yeah.
[242:29.21]Yeah, that's awesome.
[242:31.75]Don't you throw them in the pool?
[242:33.51]Don't throw them in the pool.
[242:36.57]When I say how many fucking hot dogs I'm gonna make, it's seven and nobody eats them.
[242:41.33]Nobody eats seven dogs.
[242:46.02]You know, I'm gonna eat one.
[242:50.26]Those are fucking gross.
[242:51.14]Those are raw.
[242:51.70]I don't even know what I'm doing up here.
[242:55.04]That was pretty much raw.
[242:56.04]That was a raw hot dog that I saved.
[242:59.64]There it is.
[243:00.54]There we go.
[243:05.80]Honestly, I was like, how long is this video?

[246:28.98]I was going to say, forget you.
[246:33.08]That's better.
[246:33.84]Forget you.
[246:34.52]I don't know what that is.
[246:37.96]Don't step in that.
[246:38.81]I don't know what you're doing.
[246:41.73]You guys feel anything?
[246:42.63]There's bugs everywhere.
[246:45.08]I hate coming out here because there's bugs everywhere.
[246:46.52]I don't like when the bugs are everywhere.
[246:48.43]I can tolerate them when they're in small doses.
[246:51.29]But... Dude, is there something on me?
[246:53.57]Is there something on my back?
[246:55.39]Is there something on my back?
[246:56.39]Just tell me.
[246:56.83]Get it.
[246:57.25]So many people use this clip.
[246:58.37]Get it.
[246:58.66]Dude, get it.
[246:59.48]Get it.
[246:59.76]Dude, come on.
[247:00.18]Just get it.
[247:00.66]Get it.
[247:00.84]What is on my back?
[247:01.80]What's on my back?
[247:02.36]Dude, get it.
[247:02.80]Just get it.
[247:03.56]I'll stand still.
[247:04.24]I'll hit it with a baseball bat.
[247:05.36]I don't care.
[247:17.48]What?
[247:17.96]What the fuck is that?
[247:20.76]No, no, no, please!
[247:22.96]Oh my god!
[247:24.00]Gonna need a health potion after that one.
[247:34.51]I think I stalked a few of them.
[247:39.63]Oh shit, zombies!
[247:55.13]Say it again, man.
[247:55.98]Say it again.
[247:56.44]Wow.
[248:03.26]Wow.
[248:07.66]This is what it looks like up close.
[248:13.09]Clear.
[248:15.73]Farewell, brother.
[248:17.55]I fear I deliver you to a darker place.
[248:20.37]May the light of lights illuminate your path.
[248:25.60]Now, fuck you.
[248:27.32]You see what I got dealing with back here?
[248:33.55]Oh my God, that was so loud.
[248:35.03]Thank God.
[248:36.07]Thank God I had that down to like 50% on my equalizer here.
[248:40.99]Holy shit, that was so loud for me.
[248:42.90]I'm glad it wasn't loud for you.
[248:45.30]Jesus.
[248:46.68]That hurts.
[248:47.04]My head actually hurts now.
[248:49.86]I turned that down 50% for you, not for me.
[248:53.56]By the way, I was sitting here laughing too.
[248:55.95]Leatherjacket in the mod chat said that video, the one before this, the one that was five hours, probably took like $200 in electricity to render.
[249:06.33]Dude, they're getting more and more fucking unhinged, right?
[249:14.53]Indescribable feeling we get when the next one's dead.
[249:21.88]And we go somewhere...
[249:23.86]Oh, excuse me in seat 1A.
[249:31.75]We've got a farter here.
[249:33.19]We've got a farter in 1A.
[249:35.37]Wait, me?
[249:37.11]Wait, me?
[249:42.77]That was it.
[249:44.39]That was the whole video.
[249:47.03]Just so you understand.
[249:48.11]That was the entire video.
[249:51.86]That indescribable feeling we get when the next one's dead.
[249:58.65]That was it.
[249:59.41]You lost 30 seconds of your life.
[250:01.35]Oh, excuse me.
[250:07.67]In seat 1A, we've got a farter here.
[250:10.82]And why would it be some random dickhead with a webcam on and sitting at his desk?
[250:18.20]Who is this person?
[250:20.82]Is this a producer of the movie?
[250:23.16]Who the fuck is this guy?
[250:24.74]Why is this webcam video?
[250:27.08]We've got a farter in 1A!
[250:29.57]Wait, me?
[250:31.93]Wait, me?
[250:32.75]You hear like a... Hi, I'm Saul Goodness.
[250:40.61]I act for a living.
[250:44.41]Shut up!
[250:47.55]Oh!
[250:48.19]Wait, be hard, you...
[250:50.38]Alright, everybody.
[250:51.86]VRJosh, did you make that one?
[250:55.28]Did you make that video?
[250:57.52]Why are you in the title?
[250:59.94]Why are you... Hi, I'm Saul Goodness.
[251:03.16]I act for a living.
[251:05.54]No.
[251:06.14]What the fuck?
[251:09.24]Shut up.
[251:14.30]Why...
[251:23.52]Alright, everybody, stepping up to the podium is Jeremy Elbertson, Shortstop and outfielder for the Boston Banana Bros.
[251:30.34]Please raise your hand if you have any questions to ask him.
[251:37.23]Hey, Jeremy, Dean Dingus from Burger Boy News.
[251:40.97]You had a pretty rough day at the plate, 0 for 5 with four strikeouts.
[251:44.85]What are you going to do to improve for the next game?
[251:48.20]Shut up.
[251:49.68]Shut up.
[251:52.12]Yeah, yo, oh, yeah, yeah, shut the fuck up.
[251:56.16]Stupid, you're all stupid idiots.
[251:59.96]Alright, thank you, Jerma.
[252:04.94]Hello, Jerma, Anthony Bantany from Mr. Green Gazette.
[252:08.82]Your team gave up a home run.
[252:09.95]I got to pause this because this is like an old-timey radio mic.
[252:14.50]I'm not even at a press conference booth.
[252:16.90]You had a shot at catching at the wall, but you weren't able to catch it.
[252:20.56]Do you think your short stature had an influence on the way it played out?
[252:26.25]Listen, I'll give you this.
[252:27.83]I'm not tiny.
[252:29.11]I'm compact.
[252:30.75]Huh?
[252:31.63]Can you give me that?
[252:32.13]Can you guys give me that?
[252:34.36]Well, Jeremy, it says here that you're officially listed at 5'2".
[252:38.00]I ain't 5'2"!
[252:38.72]5'7".
[252:38.98]Alright.
[252:41.52]Sorry.
[252:42.32]Forget I asked.
[252:45.37]Hi, Jerma.
[252:46.61]You had a moment where you dropped an easy fly ball in the infield, and one of your teammates, he told me that your manager, BF Bugleberry, he confronted you about that play, and you allegedly told him to, quote, suck a fart out of your ass.
[253:02.75]We actually have the audio for that argument right here.
[253:05.19]I'm just going to play that right now.
[253:06.76]How about you suck a fart out of my ass?
[253:09.24]That was pretty rude, I'd say.
[253:10.76]I did say that.
[253:11.10]So are you going to apologize to your manager?
[253:12.96]No.
[253:13.74]No, I'm sorry.
[253:14.20]No.
[253:14.64]I ain't going to do it.
[253:16.16]No.
[253:17.92]No, fuck you.
[253:19.05]I may have caused it, but I'm not going to deal with it.
[253:21.13]You are.
[253:22.66]Hello, Jeremy.
[253:23.78]Rick Johnson from Otto's Big News.
[253:26.20]One last question for you.
[253:27.20]We have exclusive footage of you throwing up in your dugout after eating a whole sleeve of Oreos.
[253:34.93]What are your thoughts on that?
[253:37.25]If I chop you up in a meat grinder, and the only thing that comes out that's left of you is your eyeball, you're probably dead.
[253:48.09]Okay.
[253:50.02]Thank you, Jeremy.
[253:52.77]Oh my God, this is so fucking funny.
[253:55.93]The Las Vegas Drew Crew, the day after this conference.
[253:58.56]Good.
[253:59.98]I'd rather be on the Drew Crew.
[254:03.08]Gotcha.
[254:06.82]But you know, it's not a gotcha.
[254:11.89]Drugs are not good.
[254:14.09]Hi, everyone.
[254:15.05]I'm Peter Park, aka Spider-Man.
[254:19.11]What?
[254:27.42]What happened?
[254:28.72]No.
[254:33.99]Hello!
[254:35.01]It's me, Mario.
[254:36.55]I want to talk to you about drugs.
[254:38.81]Boys and girls, don't do drugs.
[254:41.29]You don't have to do them.
[254:42.78]That's part of the movie where everyone goes like this.
[254:44.50]Oh, yeah, whatever, okay, yeah.
[255:11.33]So long!
[255:11.77]Get the fuck outta here!
[255:15.48]Sit the fuck down!
[255:16.54]It's time for you to pay!
[255:20.46]You're going down!
[255:23.10]Okie dokie!
[255:39.57]Hello again, Peter.
[255:41.31]If I think so.
[255:42.21]I'm here to tell you that you have a choice to make.
[255:46.51]And it's time for you to make it.
[255:48.43]I feel like I'm watching this in my head in a dream.
[255:52.15]Talking about drugs.
[255:53.23]Ow!
[255:53.35]Ow!
[255:53.59]No!
[255:58.18]No, no, no, no!
[256:02.30]Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[256:02.88]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
[256:03.62]You didn't make your choice.
[256:13.32]I shit my pants here right now.
[256:46.37]Jesus Christ.
[256:46.93]So I take the driving test, okay.
[256:54.37]Ready?
[257:16.93]I've been waiting to ride this one, man.
[257:18.66]I'm not scared, though.
[257:19.32]Are you scared?
[257:19.78]Uh, nope.
[257:20.26]Yeah, I bet you are.
[257:21.32]I'm not.
[257:23.70]I bet you're scared.
[257:24.72]Uh, okay, it's a yellow, so stop the... Okay, okay.
[257:27.92]You gotta make sure... You gotta stop when it's a yellow.
[257:30.32]Okay.
[257:32.67]Yeah, dude, hey.
[257:33.89]I'm just saying.
[257:34.77]Yep, okay, yep.
[257:37.59]You look like you're gonna scream.
[257:39.35]No, I ain't gonna scream.
[257:41.21]You're gonna scream, though.
[257:43.46]Okay, this is really hot now.
[257:46.87]Easy, easy.
[257:48.17]Easy on the pedal.
[257:50.35]You're just driving the car.
[257:52.05]You're just driving the car.
[257:59.63]You're driving off the road.
[258:03.77]Okay, Jeremy.
[258:05.69]You're driving off the road.
[258:06.71]Back on the road.
[258:10.21]Why are you turning around?
[258:11.31]What are you doing?
[258:12.25]I'm spinning.
[258:13.85]Why am I spinning around?
[258:14.85]You're on the side of the highway.
[258:15.87]I got it.
[258:16.16]I got it.
[258:16.36]I'm alright.
[258:16.64]I'm alright.
[258:16.94]You've got to turn around.
[258:18.50]This thing ain't safe, man.
[258:19.48]This thing's not even a safe ride.
[258:20.36]I don't think this has been rated.

[264:39.95]I'm new in the neighborhood.
[264:42.67]I noticed you have a really nice house.
[264:47.69]I'd love to come in.
[264:49.01]Could I come in?
[264:50.21]Could I come in your house?
[264:54.79]Wait, hold on.
[264:55.51]Hold on.
[264:56.25]There's a message.
[264:57.97]Hold on, wait.
[264:58.41]There's a special message from Mr. Giraffe.
[265:01.93]I've got to answer it.
[265:05.63]Hello?
[265:07.87]Mr. Giraffe, oh my goodness, I'm so glad to hear from you.
[265:12.05]Did you find that company?
[265:13.85]Yeah, yeah, no, no, I didn't mean to hang up on you that hard.
[265:16.64]I didn't mean to hang up on one of your employees.
[265:19.02]No, of course not.
[265:19.74]No, I don't mean, Mr. Giraffe, I don't wanna buy Google stock.
[265:24.84]I wanna buy the TikTok company.
[265:27.46]Alright, well, you find me a company that is just like TikTok then and buy that one then.
[265:33.06]Go yourself.
[265:36.62]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[265:37.86]That's what I hear.
[265:38.94]Shut up.
[265:40.42]Shut up.
[265:42.90]Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.
[265:44.72]Shut the fuck up.
[265:46.93]Stupid, you're all stupid idiots.
[265:50.47]You're dumb.
[265:51.93]You're the dumbest one here.
[265:53.79]Yeah.
[265:56.37]No, no, no, no.
[265:56.83]Get the, turn that off.
[265:58.01]Damn it, no, I'm a different person now.

[266:02.80]Jesus.
[266:08.25]Burger King incident.
[266:11.86]Burger King incident.
[266:39.47]No.
[266:42.52]He's like, he's turning.
[266:45.26]Oh shit, he's turning.
[266:46.90]He's just growling.
[266:50.96]I gotta go.
[267:12.27]Early man.
[267:12.95]First ever fire.
[267:14.15]Oh, goodness.
[267:15.87]Someone's using the caveman, by the way.
[267:17.69]This is definitely a caveman video.
[267:19.91]Without a single doubt.
[267:22.57]Long before Homo sapiens began to populate the Earth, another human species had established itself across much of the Eurasian continent.
[267:32.37]The Neanderthals.
[267:39.25]fossils discovered during the last two centuries in the Atlantic Ocean and in Siberia have shed some light on these mysterious archaic humans.
[267:48.78]I was in VR for like eight hours, okay?
[267:51.16]That's why I look like that.
[267:51.96]They had culture, they had social systems, they had intelligence.
[268:01.34]Recent archaeological finds in England and France have helped researchers find out more about these early inhabitants of Eurasia.
[268:31.98]No.
[268:32.30]My.
[269:20.09]Jerma's first stream.
[269:22.93]My nose is like congested from laughing.
[269:25.41]What the hell happened to me?
[269:43.95]I don't, I don't know.
[269:44.97]I don't know.
[269:46.09]I don't know.
[269:52.48]It was pressure.
[269:54.16]Maybe.
[269:54.42]I don't know.
[270:02.51]God, fuck you.
[270:03.57]Stop putting that in.
[270:05.51]What the hell?
[270:13.61]Hey, hey, what's up?
[270:14.55]How are you?
[270:16.03]Yeah, I just moved in, yep.
[270:18.58]New to the neighborhood.
[270:19.64]Me.
[270:20.76]I love your house.
[270:21.58]I love what you're doing here.
[270:22.68]You know what I mean?
[270:24.22]I love this house.
[270:26.54]Really, really beautiful lawn you have, too.
[270:29.02]Yeah.
[270:29.70]I got kids.
[270:30.44]Yeah, we all get kids, right?
[270:31.72]No.
[270:31.90]It might sound weird, but if you ever want to hang out and just kind of do something, just you and me.
[270:35.21]No.
[270:35.59]We'd have to get the families together, whatever.
[270:36.95]That's fine.
[270:37.93]Like, I would come in your house.
[270:39.15]No.
[270:39.27]I would come over your house.
[270:42.05]and you'd let me in, right?
[270:43.35]Like I would come, we'd do a thing.
[270:44.65]Would you be interested?
[270:46.35]No.
[270:47.05]Okay, okay.
[270:49.85]Mm, could get some mojitos.
[270:51.87]I make an insane mojito, you don't understand.
[270:54.65]No, I'm doing fine.
[271:02.35]Here, you know the trick for a mojito?
[271:04.55]Extra mint.
[271:06.95]People don't like the taste of mint usually.
[271:08.93]Can I come in?
[271:09.66]Can I just come in?
[271:11.14]No.
[271:12.14]Okay.
[271:13.34]I could show you how to make a mojito the right way and not like...
[271:33.00]Let's see how you handle an old-fashioned quick draw.
[271:38.42]That was loud.
[271:39.42]I'll count to three.
[271:41.56]And then I'll say draw.
[271:44.53]I count to three.
[271:46.29]Then we draw.
[271:47.83]Alright, partner.
[271:50.75]You tell me when.
[271:52.15]One.
[271:55.99]Two.
[271:56.13]Be on your best behavior.
[272:01.15]Three.
[272:19.92]It's over.
[272:22.00]Okay, nobody use this for anything else besides what we're doing this for.
[272:25.28]There's no way anyone's gonna use this for anything else besides riding a fucking roller coaster.
[272:34.54]Oh no.
[272:37.34]Yeah, dude, hey.
[272:39.47]Yep, okay, yep.
[272:44.03]No, I ain't gonna scream.
[272:45.93]You're gonna scream though.
[272:48.17]Okay, this is really hot now.
[272:49.83]Yeah.
[273:18.52]Why am I spinning around?
[273:20.34]Dude, I got it, I got it, I'm alright, I'm alright.
[273:23.18]This thing ain't safe, man.
[273:24.08]It's alright, I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright.
[273:29.77]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[273:32.61]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[273:36.63]Oh.
[273:42.15]I don't like doing that.
[273:53.95]I feel like I'm going to fall out.
[274:02.66]My sideburns a different length.
[274:05.08]It's hard.
[274:05.68]It's actually hard to get this right.
[274:10.85]I'm coming for you!
[274:11.57]You're the one I'm gonna get!
[274:15.30]You're my fool's pen and teller.
[274:41.89]No strings.
[274:42.33]Ta-da.
[274:46.69]Let's go.
[274:47.21]Hey.
[274:53.77]Where'd he go?
[274:54.95]Where's the bunny?
[274:57.05]Where'd the bunny go?
[274:57.91]I don't know.
[275:00.47]Where's that rabbit?
[275:01.13]Uh-oh.
[275:24.00]What?
[275:26.08]How did I tie it in a knot?
[275:29.46]I tied it in a knot somehow.
[275:31.76]What is going on?
[275:37.58]How does this work?
[275:42.48]A rose.
[275:43.49]Oh, I missed.
[275:47.53]This next one's called sit down.
[275:49.57]Sit down and stop talking during the show.
[275:53.33]This next trick is called Fire Rose.
[275:57.37]This is fucking dumb.
[276:03.81]Hold on.
[276:11.98]Why were they standing up?
[276:15.64]Hello again, Steve.
[276:19.86]Thank you.
[276:21.46]Thank you very much.
[276:25.39]Don't be alarmed.
[276:26.13]Don't be alarmed.
[276:26.69]Don't get out of your seat.
[276:29.33]This is the greatest act I've ever seen.
[276:33.08]Here I go.
[276:36.52]Okay.
[276:42.56]Bingo.
[276:46.79]Is this a video game?
[276:48.49]Yes.
[276:49.59]Is this like an F1 video game?
[276:50.65]What is this?
[276:51.03]I'm passing you again for the third time this race.
[276:54.35]Oh, no.

[282:34.81]You know what?
[282:36.41]I can't even say it to you, but you know what I was gonna say.
[282:40.33]I was gonna say, forget you.
[282:43.00]That's better.

[286:45.10]Oh, God.
[286:53.42]Here we go.
[286:58.11]Open up your textbook.
[287:04.68]I'm in the middle of teaching, Harry.
[287:06.32]That's not the time to use that spell.
[287:09.08]Didn't they ever tell you, you only use that spell if you mean to kill another wizard?
[287:15.23]Never use that spell, Harry.
[287:19.95]And now you're gonna be floating in the air.
[287:21.73]There he is.
[287:23.59]Turn him around, down.
[287:26.54]Swinging around, he's swinging around, he's swinging around, down.
[287:30.44]Never use that spell in my classroom again.
[287:34.16]The Gmod Harry... Oh, I thought it was a different Virteo.
[287:39.01]Different Virteo.
[287:47.19]Oh, hi.
[287:49.14]I'm new in the neighborhood.
[287:51.02]I noticed you have a really nice house.

[287:56.62]Could I come in?
[287:57.84]Could I come in your house?
[288:00.20]I'm new in the neighborhood.
[288:01.88]Me and my family just moved in down the street.
[288:05.16]And I just was trying to meet the neighbors.
[288:09.33]Just trying to meet the neighbors, that's all.
[288:14.27]New salad fingers.
[288:17.01]I love what you did with the yard, by the way.
[288:20.77]That beautiful grass.
[288:22.49]The grass looks beautiful.
[288:24.23]How do you get it that long?
[288:25.65]I don't know.
[288:26.11]Maybe you give it some pointers.
[288:28.90]Yeah.
[288:30.13]Can I come in?
[288:30.81]Yeah, let me.
[288:32.03]Can I come in?
[288:33.75]Let me in.
[288:34.93]Let me in your house, please.
[288:36.81]Can I come in?
[288:38.00]Let me in your house!
[288:39.70]I had some dental work done and they added extra length.
[288:44.84]Let me in the house!
[288:48.22]Can I come in your house?
[288:49.60]Just let me in your house and I'll give you whatever you want.
[288:51.92]I barely sleep.
[288:53.92]You like drugs?
[288:54.92]Let me in the house!
[288:56.22]Bleed.
[288:57.19]Coke.
[288:59.35]That's all I got.
[289:00.33]This is a fucking TikTok video.
[289:03.62]This is a... This is a TikTok video at this point.
[289:08.78]Can I come in your house?
[289:22.55]Well, hold on.
[289:24.67]You could.
[289:26.37]I'm a pretty normal guy.
[289:27.21]I like jazz music.
[289:29.27]I like scotch.
[289:32.23]You know?
[289:35.19]Not what I'm drinking.
[289:35.81]That's a green tea, by the way.
[289:46.10]Why is this copyright?
[289:47.18]I got another copyright warning here.
[289:51.80]Why?
[289:53.60]The beeps?
[289:56.12]I don't understand that at all.
[289:57.54]I really don't.
[290:00.37]Hey, are you ready?
[290:02.79]How are you?
[290:04.59]Are you ready?
[290:05.25]You don't look ready.
[290:06.47]I'm doing great.
[290:07.73]Can I scream?
[290:08.59]Why are you?
[290:09.23]Can I scream in your ears?
[290:10.27]I'm literally just trying to help you.
[290:11.43]I'm going to scream in your ears.
[290:12.23]I put up with these fucking people.
[290:19.76]I swear to God, just screaming at me.
[290:22.90]I'll get a Big Mac and then like a 10-piece.
[290:25.40]That's it?
[290:26.20]Two McDoubles, two McChickens.
[290:28.64]This is all you have?
[290:29.26]This is it?
[290:30.52]Freeze.
[290:30.80]Big Mac, two McChickens, 10-piece nugget, and two McChickens.
[290:37.75]That's $49.
[290:39.65]The 10-piece is for the party.
[290:42.79]Why are you... If you're eating with more than one person, the 10-piece is to be shared with whoever else is there.
[290:48.74]True.
[290:50.97]Look, I don't care.
[290:52.97]I don't care about that.
[290:56.02]Put your card in.
[290:57.06]Here, take it.
[290:59.64]Flip, it goes the other way.
[291:02.70]It goes the other way.
[291:03.46]The card reader, it goes the other way.
[291:05.44]Take this from me.
[291:06.68]Take this from me right now.
[291:08.24]Take it from me.
[291:09.02]You have a chip on it, right?
[291:10.14]You have a chip.
[291:11.18]Take it from me, dude.
[291:12.30]I don't want to fucking hold it anymore.
[291:13.50]Take it from me.
[291:14.04]Take this thing out of my fucking hands before I freak out.
[291:16.52]How many stores have you been to in your whole life that you don't know the chip goes...
[291:21.60]Holy shit!
[291:25.81]Die, you motherfucker!
[291:41.63]Hi, my name's Otto.
[291:44.37]Let me introduce you to all my friends.
[291:47.85]Diamonds are forever.
[291:50.13]LOL.
[291:52.14]Unfortunately, I have to diagnose you with cringe.
[291:56.70]I only know how to make risotto.
[291:57.82]It's a me, Mario.
[292:04.91]Okay.
[292:10.16]Let me take a sip of my apple cider.
[292:11.88]Oh, that's good stuff.
[292:12.89]Ever since I was on my own, I, uh, started to cook for myself.
[292:16.41]Oh, no!
[292:17.19]Bowser!
[292:17.91]His bones are literally everywhere.
[292:19.73]I feel so bad for this dude right now.
[292:21.77]It's twerking time!
[292:23.34]Sit the fuck down, Bowser.
[292:25.14]They got kicked out of chef school.
[292:26.38]I didn't.
[292:38.17]Where am I?
[292:39.05]What's going on here?
[292:40.69]You have a choice to make, and it's time for you to make it.
[292:46.70]Oh my God, am I a good Spider-Man.
[292:50.02]Everyone knows I'm Spider-Man now.
[292:51.52]Oh, what am I gonna do?
[292:55.64]Will you be able to succeed?
[292:59.11]Hey, breathe in the scented candle.
[293:04.61]Oh, by the way, Peter, the room is about to fill with gas.
[293:16.67]Here we go.
[293:18.25]I want to go home.
[293:21.52]Not to be confused with the real movie.
[293:25.38]Potion.
[293:27.08]Don't mind if I do.
[293:30.44]That hurts a little.
[293:31.26]Does this person feel like that?
[293:33.59]I don't know who gave this to me.
[293:48.48]Don't mind if I do.
[293:49.80]But you know it's not a gotcha.
[294:00.81]Drugs and alcohol.
[294:03.01]Hi, everyone.
[294:05.23]I'm Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man.
[294:16.72]No, MJ, everyone knows I'm Spider-Man now.
[294:20.66]We're gonna have to go underground.
[294:22.22]We're gonna have to hide for a little while.
[294:26.54]You know, you have the power to fix all this.
[294:31.34]Where are you?
[294:34.94]Oh, these are heavy.
[294:38.13]What's that?
[294:45.79]Sorry I kept you all waiting.
[294:47.23]Made some adjustments to my suit.
[294:49.59]Feel like it's a little more appropriate.
[294:51.76]It's time to fight some crime.
[294:54.40]Let's go.
[295:06.09]God damn it.
[295:10.37]Final remix.
[295:59.22]I love the rhythm heaven ones, they're so funny.
[296:05.08]Each one of these scenes takes like six hours to make, by the way.
[296:11.38]If you were curious.
[296:21.09]Half-Life 2 again.
[296:35.69]Jesus!
[297:20.20]He's a fan.
[297:53.25]You wanna see some real magic?
[298:24.41]What's going on?
[298:35.03]Hi.
[298:35.25]What the fuck is that?
[298:38.65]That's some of my shit I've been doing.
[298:41.31]Oh, no.
[298:42.30]Oh, no.
[298:43.12]Oh, no.
[298:44.60]Oh, no.
[298:54.65]I'm alright.
[298:55.05]I'm alright.
[298:55.47]I'm alright.
[298:56.15]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[298:58.13]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[298:59.33]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[299:02.47]Wee!
[299:08.12]Okay.
[299:12.64]Okay.
[299:14.60]Alright.
[299:14.82]We're going to do one more.
[299:17.58]I think it's time to close this out.
[299:20.68]Five hours of this.
[299:23.21]One more.
[299:25.00]We got part two.
[299:26.02]Don't worry.
[299:26.52]We got part two coming.
[299:29.70]We're currently at video number 131.
[299:36.41]We've watched 131 videos today.
[299:41.61]So I will keep that where it is.
[299:45.96]Oh, we're going to watch one more.
[299:46.92]I'm just, my whole body hurts.
[299:49.96]It's been too many emotions over the last five hours.
[299:54.39]We are going to play the last one, though.
[299:57.09]I've been told, please play the last one.
[300:00.21]So here is the final one of the night.
[300:04.55]We will be back.
[300:07.35]But we'll talk in like two minutes.
[300:15.53]So here it is.
[300:16.28]This is the last one of the night.
[300:18.40]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[300:19.24]If you're going to leave, then see you soon.
[300:23.85]I am at my pretty much limit of laughing and the smile lines I'm developing on my face are huge.
[300:31.09]So I definitely have to go take a bath.
[300:35.20]This is the last one.
[300:40.06]Hello, everybody.
[300:42.66]I'm not even winded.
[300:43.92]Right here.
[300:44.42]My name is Jerma.
[300:45.98]I'm going to start doing gameplay commentaries.
[300:48.48]750 people have recorded this video.
[300:52.10]2,000 subscriber extraordinaire.
[300:54.01]What's going on, guys?
[300:54.91]It's Jerma here for the 4,000 subscriber video.
[300:57.77]Give us cats.
[300:58.97]15,000 subscriber.
[300:59.93]I don't know what you call this.
[301:01.93]Spoiler.
[301:03.64]What a messy fucking room.
[301:05.14]Holy shit.
[301:05.90]That room is a mess.
[301:07.00]Oh, by the way, let me make this really clear.
[301:12.63]I'm still alive.
[301:14.01]Okay?
[301:14.41]Let's just make that very clear.
[301:16.23]I'm still alive.
[301:18.54]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one.
[301:22.80]Absolutely terrible.
[301:24.24]Wait, is that a camera?
[301:25.76]Are you done?
[301:26.64]I'm here with Smite Sunday.
[301:28.94]Oh, my dog just fought it.
[301:30.84]That's perfect.
[301:31.91]That's perfect right there.
[301:33.63]You hit a heavy in the head.
[301:34.89]Yeah, sometimes I like to smoke down here.
[301:39.19]Who is in the car?
[301:40.97]Oh, shit.
[301:43.42]The giant enemy spider.
[301:45.77]You went too fast, Claire.
[301:46.69]Please give me the pop star.
[302:10.56]Wait, is there a close fight behind you, behind you, behind you?
[302:13.89]Oh, my God!
[302:15.37]Hey, Jerma, get the fuck out of here!
[302:18.70]That's somebody's asshole.
[302:20.26]Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first ever Jermal Rumble episode.
[302:24.88]That's right.
[302:25.94]It's Super Mario.
[302:27.20]Fuck that.
[302:27.56]So it's going to be the chicken.
[302:28.50]And someone's coming from the rafters.
[302:29.73]Somebody just splashed off of the titans.
[302:32.81]No, no, no, no.
[302:34.51]It's a rexos.
[302:36.49]Oh, no, no, no.
[302:37.57]Don't do it.
[302:38.51]Don't do it.
[302:39.51]The real winner of the first ever Jermal Rumble live action is the disco titan.
[302:49.95]I have a second channel now.
[302:55.03]Oh, second Jerma.
[302:58.23]Something I'm gonna train and love.
[303:00.63]What the fucking haircut?
[303:03.65]What the hell was that?
[303:17.76]Damn.
[303:18.82]Tricked you.
[303:19.84]It's Egypt and we're both flog pyros.
[303:48.42]That was really nice.
[303:54.87]We got way more to see, by the way.
[303:56.31]That was just part one.
[303:58.57]Part two will be pretty soon.
[304:00.85]I want to get through sorcery part two, so we'll do that first.
[304:07.67]Maybe next weekend?
[304:09.26]Hey, save the date.
[304:11.28]Next weekend.
[304:12.56]Maybe Saturday.
[304:13.26]Maybe Sunday.
[304:14.38]Who knows?
[304:17.05]Uh, that was amazing.
[304:19.97]I know I'm a broken record, but we haven't even gone through half the videos yet.
[304:26.74]There's still so much more fucking awesome, hilarious shit to watch.
[304:30.60]And goddamn, you guys knock it out of the park every single time.
[304:34.56]Every single time.
[304:36.64]I honestly can't believe it.
[304:38.72]Every time we do this, it gets better.
[304:41.62]The videos are funnier.
[304:43.36]How?
[304:47.01]I would watch more.
[304:47.83]I really would, but I'm at that limit of insanity, right?
[304:57.46]To all the people that made a video, anybody that submitted it, thank you.
[305:02.60]All you hear now, the 30,000 plus people that were here almost the whole night, that was a ton of fun.
[305:08.69]It always is.
[305:11.30]Again, blown away by the creativity and just what you guys can come up with with me just being a fucking random dickhead in front of a green screen.
[305:21.53]I don't know what to say.
[305:22.55]That was fucking hilarious.
[305:26.59]We will return to do more of this next weekend.
[305:33.91]God, that was funny.
[305:35.93]I can't even tell you what my favorite was.
[305:37.76]I have no favorites.
[305:39.62]That would be impossible.
[305:42.78]But I'm blessed to have a community that's this talented and this funny.
[305:47.72]I really don't think there's anything like this.
[305:50.04]I really don't.
[305:52.68]Anywhere else.
[305:53.48]And I mean that.
[305:54.12]I really do.
[305:56.21]Thanks for all your submissions.
[305:57.25]They've been phenomenal.
[305:59.73]Let's do it again.
[306:05.89]The next time I will be live will be... That is a great question.
[306:11.54]Next couple days, maybe.
[306:13.99]Thanks to the huge, by the way, huge thanks to the mods and community leaders.
[306:21.56]They vetted all these videos.
[306:23.16]They had to watch all these.
[306:24.16]I didn't see any of these, right?
[306:26.28]So can we get a clap for the mods and community leaders, please?
[306:30.36]Because they went through the last week plus of watching these and getting me in the playlist and everything.
[306:37.67]I'll see you again in a couple days, two or three days.
[306:39.31]Keep an eye on the sus, maybe on...
[306:42.07]Not sure.
[306:42.51]Maybe Tuesday, Wednesday.
[306:44.81]We'll see.
[306:46.73]But blown away again.
[306:48.17]Just completely mind blown.
[306:50.27]That was so much fun.
[306:51.71]It always is.
[306:54.95]And thanks for watching.
[306:55.69]Thanks for sticking around.
[306:56.61]All the subs that came in.
[306:57.69]Thank you.
[306:59.19]Lazy Purple came in for a raid.
[307:00.52]Thanks for the raid, Lazy Purple.
[307:02.36]He's a good dude.
[307:03.22]Go follow Lazy Purple, please.
[307:06.72]Been around for a long time.
[307:07.72]Almost as long as I have.
[307:12.78]But, yeah.
[307:16.28]I keep thinking about the five-hour VOD.
[307:18.22]It's killing me.
[307:23.27]Let's send you guys somewhere, though.
[307:24.55]I haven't rated anybody in a long time.
[307:27.29]Who's streaming right now?
[307:28.81]Who could we go to?
[307:37.44]Uh, we could go to... Hey, let's go to Vinny.
[307:41.37]Vinny's playing Half-Life.
[307:42.93]We literally watched like 10 Half-Life videos.
[307:46.91]Let's go raid Vinny.
[307:48.35]Say hi to Vinny.
[307:51.92]Vinny was in like three of those videos too, so that's funny.
[307:57.04]I'll see you guys in a few days.
[307:58.04]Thanks again.
[307:59.32]Much love to you, obviously.
[308:02.50]We'll see you soon.
[308:03.52]My whole body hurts.
[308:04.36]I'm going to take a bath and relax for a day or two.
[308:08.04]We'll be back with more sorcery.
[308:11.13]Kare Part 2.
[308:15.11]Maybe some more multiverses.
[308:16.29]You might see that too.
[308:17.15]That's a possibility.
[308:20.43]Take care of yourselves.
[308:21.49]Good night.
[308:22.36]Thanks for sticking around.
[308:27.40]Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[308:29.66]Goodbye.
[308:31.56]Call you mother.
[308:33.43]See you soon.
[309:10.04]Thank you.
[309:34.16]I want to say also real quick, the VOD is probably absolutely destroyed.
[309:40.45]I would be surprised if you could even watch it.
[309:42.87]So in the event that it's absolutely just decimated, I might have to just delete it.
[309:49.44]It depends.
[309:50.30]So be aware that it's a half.
[309:51.98]It's probably muted.
[309:52.70]If you weren't here, I'm really sorry.
[309:55.24]But DMCA copyright.
[309:59.00]That's whoever.
[310:00.42]We just moved to Vinny's channel.
[310:01.52]Alright.
[310:03.27]Goodbye.
