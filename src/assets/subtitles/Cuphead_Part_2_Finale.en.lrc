[02:28.10]Hey!
[02:30.46]Hey!
[02:31.42]I haven't even, like, said anything.
[02:33.56]I had to go get my phone, sorry.
[02:36.02]What is all over the ground?
[02:36.86]What did I do?
[02:39.28]I haven't been in this room in, like, five days.
[02:43.32]And I'm, like, looking, I'm looking, I'm like, what the fuck happened in here?
[02:45.26]Why is there, like, makeup all over the ground?
[02:50.84]Is it powder?
[02:51.54]Oh, that's from, okay.
[02:52.62]Now I remember now.
[02:54.04]I remember now.
[02:56.83]Give me one second.
[02:59.10]I'll return in one second.
[03:35.29]Okay.
[03:36.73]So.
[03:37.96]Hi.
[03:39.46]Bear with me a little bit here, guys.
[03:41.60]I just got off a plane.
[03:42.88]I'm a little jet-lagged.
[03:44.44]What is today's date?
[03:46.06]I like Rumpelstiltskin.
[03:49.00]I fell asleep for like a whole day.
[03:52.88]Put on my business suit.
[03:55.02]I will talk about that, too.
[03:58.09]Things are potentially happening.
[04:00.13]That's all I got to say.
[04:01.71]Things are kind of, might be happening.
[04:04.33]There's a lot of moving parts.
[04:06.43]And I don't know how much I actually will be able to talk about, because nothing's real yet.
[04:11.06]But we'll talk about that later.
[04:12.58]In a little bit.
[04:18.31]Rumpelstiltskin was the guy that fell asleep for like fucking 12 years, right?
[04:26.13]Wait, Rip Van Winkle Rumpelstiltskin.
[04:28.95]Which one is the right one?
[04:31.99]Anyways, let's move over to the game.
[04:33.85]You've been sitting here waiting long enough.
[04:37.53]Let me put this back on to get that smooth jazz music.
[04:40.07]I'm fairly close to the end of the game.
[04:43.79]So I'm not sure exactly how much is left in... Gotta do this.
[04:50.71]Hey, thank you, Ivory, for the seven bucks.
[04:52.97]Welcome back, Jerma.
[04:54.03]I actually gave Cuphead a chance on my own, and looking back at the VOD, I realize you have incredible skill and apologize for all the jokes I made.
[05:01.79]Still glad to... You know, first of all, let's stop you right there.
[05:04.67]Thank you.
[05:05.95]Thank you.
[05:06.47]I appreciate that.
[05:09.30]Thank you so much.
[05:12.58]Anyways, still glad to hear you're back, and congrats on becoming the host for Nickelodeon's Legends of the Hidden Temple reboot.
[05:19.74]Well, you know, it took me a long time.
[05:21.36]A lot of work to get there.
[05:24.10]But, no, I have nothing to do with Nickelodeon.
[05:27.78]Skilled streamer, thank you.
[05:31.10]But anyways, Stix Renegade, thanks for the five bucks.
[05:33.13]Rat Movie, dab on streamer, eat a fruitcake whole.
[05:35.73]Beautiful owl.
[05:38.31]What is OWO?
[05:39.19]What is this?
[05:41.52]I'm old.
[05:42.00]What does that mean?
[05:43.52]What is that?
[05:45.55]Is that supposed to be an owl?
[05:46.73]That's all I see is owl.
[05:48.79]What is that?
[05:52.91]I don't get it.
[05:55.25]What cartoon is that from?
[06:02.68]No idea.
[06:03.32]Old Owl.
[06:10.38]I don't know what that is.
[06:14.89]To me, that's like an owl making a funny face.
[06:17.61]Like, ooh, ooh, it's me.
[06:18.87]Like, hee hee.
[06:23.74]Urban Dictionary.
[06:24.54]Alright, fine.
[06:25.82]I don't know what that is.
[06:26.50]O-W-O.
[06:32.84]Urban Dictionary.
[06:33.38]Oh, it's not- it's an owl going like, funny Cappany, like, like Cappany's face.
[06:38.66]Cappany.
[06:39.28]Alright, it makes sense if you say Cappany's.
[06:44.09]Another Japanese-inspired emo used to express shock, surprise- see?
[06:48.65]Like Kappa.
[06:54.18]K-A-P-P-A-N-E-S-E.
[06:56.76]Cappany's.
[06:57.58]It's like a Twitch thing, but it's like based in Japan.
[07:03.22]Whatever.
[07:04.48]Let's go.
[07:06.24]It's below that one.
[07:07.66]What?
[07:13.59]Notices somebody's bulge.
[07:17.99]No, you guys told me to urban dictionary this and I got the correct answer.
[07:21.45]It's like an owl face going like, woo, my goodness.
[07:25.24]I was right the whole time.
[07:31.89]Fuck.
[07:32.24]Alright.
[07:32.54]Let's... Alright.
[07:33.06]Thank you, anyways.
[07:34.32]We got, like, on a tangent there.
[07:37.08]Thank you, Sticks Renegade.
[07:37.88]Thank you, Ivory.
[07:38.40]Thank you, Monty the Moose, Deathman Jones, and Ivory again.
[07:42.67]Thank you all.
[07:44.29]Let's play Cuphead.
[07:46.71]So, uh, you're gonna have to give me a little bit- I'm gonna have to get a little slack here because I haven't played this game.
[07:50.47]Uh, this is literally the first time I've turned on my computer in over five days.
[07:55.74]So, last time you saw me play this was the last time I was on the computer.
[07:59.92]So I gotta get back- I gotta get, like, my- my- my hands to move again.
[08:03.14]You know what I mean?
[08:03.74]I can't- I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.
[08:05.64]What's the last thing I did?
[08:08.03]I beat the, um, the person inside the- the theater.
[08:11.27]This is the last thing I did, right?
[08:13.01]Yes.
[08:17.15]Facecam the Bible?
[08:18.53]What?
[08:20.08]Okay, here's this.
[08:21.72]Try your luck.
[08:24.54]This is Railroad Wrath.
[08:25.86]Alright, I'm gonna lose a lot.
[08:27.38]So, like, give me a second here.
[08:29.01]You know what I mean?
[08:31.83]This is a train.
[08:33.57]Get ready.
[08:35.01]He's got eyes for hands.
[08:38.43]They can be destroyed.
[08:40.94]Oh, I don't... Okay, alright, hold on.
[08:42.30]First of all...
[08:44.57]This is a bad setup.
[08:46.07]This is a bad setup.
[08:48.53]Not a good setup.
[08:49.37]I need the shotgun for this shit.
[08:51.05]Yeah, yeah, yeah, give me the shotgun.
[08:54.57]What an awful setup that was.
[08:59.74]Give me the, uh, what is it here?
[09:03.42]Spread, that's, yeah, come on.
[09:06.58]You crazy?
[09:09.40]Pretty good.
[09:09.86]Yeah, it's quick, you know, quick death.
[09:14.30]Here we go, let's do it.
[09:20.09]I'd say clear that out.
[09:20.97]See, that's what we're talking about.
[09:22.01]We're talking about fucking strategy.
[09:29.65]I like this boss.
[09:31.73]Actually, fuck it.
[09:32.29]I'll just keep this thing on.
[09:34.00]Whoa!
[09:34.44]Okay, hold on a minute.
[09:35.40]Can I jump?
[09:35.96]Can I... I can't do that.
[09:37.22]Whoa!
[09:37.52]Hold on a minute.
[09:38.12]Wait!
[09:38.68]Okay.
[09:39.52]Alright, so.
[09:40.56]Uh, hold on there.
[09:42.60]Uh, I guess... I guess, uh... I guess we have to... Oh, I get it.
[09:47.85]I get it.
[09:48.65]I see.
[09:49.81]I feel it.
[09:51.61]I have to... I have to move the cart.
[09:54.77]I get it.
[09:57.91]Oh, do I get it?
[09:59.67]I kind of get it.
[10:02.19]Oh yeah, I get it.
[10:04.07]Yes, I do get it.
[10:05.79]These things can't fuck around.
[10:07.53]Okay.
[10:12.05]Gotta break those things in the air.
[10:17.70]Nope.
[10:18.14]Nope.
[10:18.64]Nope.
[10:19.10]Nope.
[10:19.50]Nope.
[10:22.98]Not gonna happen.
[10:29.76]Just need to stay alive.
[10:36.78]Oh, fuck.
[10:43.11]Oh, my goddammit, I had the stupid thing on.
[10:45.19]Fucking goddammit.
[10:52.83]Let's go take that off.
[10:58.89]And I'm not doing any damage.
[11:00.65]Why did I decide to play this game after not playing a video game for five days and being on a fucking airplane for six hours?
[11:07.24]What the hell is wrong with me?
[11:15.16]No, I want to go... I want... I do want the shotgun, though.
[11:18.44]It's good, like, panic.
[11:20.30]And take off the fucking worst move in the whole game, please.
[11:23.76]Give me this.
[11:27.65]Coffee, like... I feel like dashing here is not good anyway, so I'll just keep this on.
[11:33.59]Alright, let's go.
[11:38.33]Let's try it again.
[11:43.93]I might go do some of the old levels just to get situated again.
[11:46.75]Actually, no, this is fine.
[11:54.44]I missed it that first time, but not the second time.
[12:03.08]Alright, this is as far back as it goes, so that's fine.
[12:08.52]Alright, now I understand what's going on.
[12:10.48]My life is much easier.
[12:11.48]This is new.
[12:13.53]What do we got?
[12:14.01]People coming to be trained?
[12:15.57]Skull man?
[12:16.03]I don't want to be, like, underneath this.
[12:18.73]Alright, yep.
[12:19.41]Exactly what I didn't want to have happen.
[12:22.57]Whoa, we gotta move!
[12:25.67]Woo!
[12:26.65]Alright, I get it.
[12:27.23]I'm gonna switch.
[12:29.79]Come on, come on, come on!
[12:30.65]Come on, come on, come on!
[12:32.37]God.
[12:34.64]This is not that bad.
[12:35.46]I just need to get myself situated for it.
[12:37.96]Where's it going?
[12:41.40]You gotta be in the middle.
[12:42.64]No!
[12:43.66]No!
[12:44.97]Oh god.
[12:46.17]Alright, this guy's really not that hard.
[12:49.39]I just really needed to warm up.
[12:51.95]I like rolled out of bed and ate an egg salad sandwich.
[12:57.51]And drove on a- I drove a fucking plane.
[12:59.23]You know what I mean?
[12:59.85]Alright, everybody quiet.
[13:08.93]This guy's like fucking... This guy's like easier than the last boss that I just fought.
[13:17.00]Fuck me.
[13:19.20]Ah!
[13:19.46]I gotta wake up.
[13:20.26]Wake up!
[13:26.40]I get it.
[13:26.80]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:27.60]Alright, which way am I going?
[13:30.12]I'm fucked.
[13:34.77]No, I'm not.
[13:38.32]Shit.
[13:39.12]Ah.
[13:39.86]Oh, my brain is so slow right now.
[13:41.37]This is not good.
[13:44.51]Oh, man.
[13:46.65]God damn it.
[13:54.27]It's always the worst when, like... This... Maybe Cuphead's not a good idea.
[14:00.17]I'm not even kidding.
[14:00.89]Cuphead's probably a terrible idea right now.
[14:08.41]It's probably not the greatest idea.
[14:11.05]But I'm gonna do it anyways, because I'm a fucking moron.
[14:13.39]I need more blood.
[14:18.68]Alright, wake up.
[14:23.44]Wait, I need to like, chug my coffee.
[14:30.04]I'm gonna slam my coffee in a second here.
[14:32.55]Like, wake the fuck up, you dickhead.
[14:35.25]What time is it?
[14:35.83]It's like 10 o'clock at night.
[14:40.81]There we go.
[14:43.77]Now what?
[14:44.39]What's the deal now?
[14:47.09]This is phase three.
[14:48.69]Tubas?
[14:49.11]I don't know what... Whoa!
[14:56.08]Woof!
[15:00.46]What are you doing?
[15:01.10]Alright, the faces... the faces attack.
[15:03.84]Not a big deal.
[15:07.91]Alright, I'm fine.
[15:10.56]Oh fuck, that thing hurts.
[15:18.32]Fuck this.
[15:22.71]Ow.
[15:24.97]Oh, die!
[15:25.63]Oh shit.
[15:32.19]Oh my god.
[15:32.99]I gotta be like further away for this.
[15:35.51]Right?
[15:35.74]What the fuck is going on?
[15:36.52]Where did I hit?
[15:37.18]His butt?
[15:38.68]I gotta hit his ass.
[15:41.67]I think.
[15:41.97]Wow.
[15:44.96]Yeah, and then shoot him in the heart.
[15:47.68]Okay, well.
[15:50.48]I'm really close.
[15:51.50]Alright, I got this.
[15:55.86]I got this.
[15:56.36]Like, I just fucking needed to get... I was drinking a coffee at like seven o'clock at night.
[16:08.91]And I'm like changing my scene.
[16:11.01]It's alright, we're gonna be fine.
[16:15.69]That actually, like, hurt.
[16:17.77]Alright, let's do it.
[16:18.96]Let's go Ghost Train, like, hardest boss of the whole game, easiest boss of the whole game, but Jeremy doesn't play video games, and he's on a plane to California, and he gets back, and restart, shut up!
[16:32.56]Get this fucking cord away from me, for once.
[16:39.85]This part is so easy.
[16:43.23]Like, you brainless fucking idiot.
[16:51.85]Dude, I woke up at like 5 o'clock in the afternoon and my brain is like, melted.
[16:57.23]Get up and like, fucking tend the garden.
[17:00.12]Oh my god.
[17:01.36]No.
[17:04.62]Just chill out.
[17:08.51]Alright, I'll get it this time.
[17:09.31]This is the one.
[17:09.79]It's really not that bad.
[17:19.18]It's not.
[17:24.36]I like the music.
[17:28.96]There it is.
[17:31.67]Just get in the middle and just chill out.
[17:33.57]Not a big deal.
[17:35.67]I'm making this up to be much more of a big deal than it is.
[17:40.76]Please be over here.
[17:41.28]Oh shit Gotta be in the middle.
[17:51.47]Oh My god, it's I'm fucking losing it already God damn it.
[17:54.65]This is so this is so easy.
[17:57.95]I can't do it right now Fucking god damn it
[18:05.54]Do you remember, like, I beat, I beat, like, three of these bosses in a row first try.
[18:09.64]And now I can't even do, like, the easiest fucking boss of the whole game.
[18:12.86]Like, give me a break.
[18:16.10]I got hit by the soap three times.
[18:27.25]God damn it.
[18:28.57]I had an idea that this might be, like, a terrible fucking idea.
[18:33.41]To, like...
[18:36.08]Hold on a minute, I gotta go back.
[18:41.84]It's soap!
[18:49.61]I want this.
[18:50.07]Alright, let's go.
[18:54.65]Get automatic parry?
[18:55.51]That's actually probably not a terrible idea.
[19:06.63]It seemed like I could do that.
[19:07.69]I was curious.
[19:09.85]Wait, what?
[19:13.39]I wanted the shotgun.
[19:15.43]No, I didn't.
[19:17.03]Stop saying things you don't mean.
[19:17.89]God damn it.
[19:28.80]Oh, man.
[19:29.70]Oh, I don't know, guys.
[19:34.17]I really don't know.
[19:35.49]This is such a fucking mistake.
[19:37.93]I should have just streamed like PlayStation 3 trash tonight.
[19:43.01]My brain is like a melted fucking popsicle.
[19:46.02]Why the hell did I think I was gonna like do Cuphead right now?
[19:48.92]Are you fucking crazy, Jeremy?
[19:57.62]This is why I wanted to charge.
[19:59.50]Get me over there.
[20:05.89]In the middle.
[20:06.33]Come on.
[20:07.11]Go!
[20:08.11]Wow!
[20:08.49]Come on, don't do that to me.
[20:15.43]I got lucky.
[20:17.55]Really.
[20:18.47]I'm fucking serious.
[20:20.52]And I fucked it up.
[20:29.30]Come on.
[20:33.73]Damn it.
[20:35.07]Now I'm in so much trouble!
[20:43.90]What a mistake.
[20:44.86]What a mistake.
[20:45.86]What a mistake.
[20:54.86]Automatic parry really wouldn't be bad here, though.
[21:03.28]Whoa!
[21:03.96]No, I can't parry that guy.
[21:06.42]Charge shot really does a lot of damage, but I think I might do charge shot and... I really should have warmed up.
[21:22.26]You know, I kind of wish I could... I kind of want to get fucking electrocuted right now.
[21:26.90]You know what I'm talking about?
[21:29.33]You ever think that?
[21:29.85]You ever, like, think that, you know, I, like, if only my brain could just get, like, 500 fucking thousand volts to just shoot through my brain right now, like, it would be better?
[21:41.82]This is for safety, and this is for killing people.
[21:48.38]You know, I just want, I just want, like, 100,000 volts to just drive through my head right now.
[21:58.01]Ah, this might have been bad.
[22:00.75]Yep.
[22:01.87]May have been a bad... Yeah, that's not gonna work.
[22:09.83]It just... It irritates me that I need, like, nine hours to wake up.
[22:15.88]Like, fuck me.
[22:16.94]You know what I mean?
[22:17.50]Like, come on, dude.
[22:20.32]I need, like, three days to get over, like, taking a three-day trip to California.
[22:25.79]What am I, fucking 90 years old?
[22:29.06]I might as well shove a fucking prune juice up my ass.
[22:32.12]Like, seriously.
[22:35.37]I'm just so... I'm too rusty.
[22:37.53]You just have to get rid of the eyes.
[22:43.01]Just fucking play it the way you should.
[22:45.09]Don't play it the way... Just calm yourself.
[22:47.53]Fucking Jack-o'-lanterns dropping shit.
[22:53.81]Just get rid of them.
[22:57.51]Make it happen get in the middle Was it dropping my terms Right in the middle come on get get over there come on Shit that was fucking poor shit
[23:31.93]One more, come on.
[23:33.41]Alright, here we go.
[23:40.79]Really?
[23:41.15]Whatever.
[23:49.12]One more.
[23:49.80]One more.
[24:05.20]Take it slow.
[24:08.76]There it is.
[24:09.10]Alright, same deal.
[24:11.34]Let's do it.
[24:17.12]I'm gonna get forward on him.
[24:30.55]Shit.
[24:32.85]Get it!
[24:34.29]Get out of my life!
[24:43.92]Get out of my fucking face, come on, warm up Jeremy!
[24:46.90]Get fucking warm, come on, that boss was not even hard.
[24:51.42]That guy was not even fucking, that guy was easy!
[24:53.30]That was easy, come on!
[24:57.64]Crack your knuckles and get, sit on the can.
[25:00.16]It's gonna be a D, but you know what, I don't care, it's okay.
[25:06.78]Alright, now we got some, now at least I've warmed up.
[25:14.36]I just spent like the last like 30 minutes Like fucking like making fun of myself They're like the amount of self-deprecation that just came out of that last boss was like I wasn't even blaming anybody else It was just like you idiot you're so old and you suck Jesus Christ Jesus man He fucking be careful
[25:41.72]Is there any other setting?
[25:42.63]Uh, no.
[25:44.41]There's simple and normal.
[25:45.71]And let's do unlock.
[25:47.83]Like a hard mode in this game?
[25:50.99]Motivational speeches.
[25:52.03]PlayStation 3 loser.
[25:53.85]Why did I go play like PlayStation 3?
[25:55.49]Like a fucking idiot.
[26:02.32]I think that's it, right?
[26:04.82]Expert unlocks later.
[26:05.90]Oh, I can imagine.
[26:06.58]Welcome to the casino.
[26:08.56]So, inkwell hell.
[26:09.68]I believe this is the end of the game.
[26:14.14]I think I'm getting to the end of the game here.
[26:19.33]I think this is one more little area here, I guess.
[26:23.53]I have all the contracts.
[26:27.07]I missed a boss?
[26:27.95]I did?
[26:35.45]Where?
[26:35.65]Where did I miss a boss?
[26:36.37]It's inside the shed.
[26:48.21]Hmm.
[26:49.19]Okay.
[26:50.81]Over here, you mean?
[26:51.47]Like, down there?
[26:51.91]Now, I've done all of World 1, World 2, World 3.
[27:01.40]Werner Werman.
[27:05.34]Werner Werman.
[27:06.30]So, apparently, this guy's still here.
[27:12.56]It's Bender?
[27:13.92]Hey, it's me, Bender!
[27:16.26]Okay, there's an area right there.
[27:24.01]Yeah, there is a whole other area that I didn't do.
[27:31.89]No, that's what he does every episode.
[27:33.71]That's every single episode.
[27:45.77]Okay, Rugged Ridge.
[27:53.83]I want to do this thing.
[27:54.53]I saw this.
[27:55.21]I want to do this.
[27:55.85]Look at this boss!
[27:57.27]Beat it first try.
[28:00.38]Well, you come back, okay?
[28:02.54]I guess you come back.
[28:03.58]And the funny scary skulls restarted.
[28:06.84]Come on.
[28:09.48]Rat boss.
[28:15.55]Can this guy die?
[28:16.33]I probably need to not have... What?
[28:19.58]What?
[28:21.52]Why can those things be attacked if they can't die?
[28:23.28]Okay, well, those things can't die.
[28:31.39]This is an awful setup here.
[28:32.55]I need to get the shotgun.
[28:33.69]Okay.
[28:38.91]Let's get the actual shotgun on.
[28:42.36]He does not die.
[28:45.64]We're going to do shotgun and I might do lob.
[28:51.02]Yeah.
[28:52.90]Yeah.
[28:57.95]Even though lob shot is kind of the worst thing in the whole game, though.
[29:02.13]You know, what are you doing, Jeremy?
[29:03.73]You're putting on the worst fucking weapon.
[29:06.08]That weapon's only good for one boss, the dragon.
[29:15.11]You lob slob.
[29:17.81]Alright, let's get some fucking classic comedy here.
[29:22.07]Oh, I need to turn off.
[29:22.85]I want to get the dash again.
[29:24.29]The good dash.
[29:25.17]I need to get the one special that you need to put on for this game to be worth not losing.
[29:31.54]Guy comes up behind.
[29:32.32]Alright, where is he?
[29:34.50]Come on.
[29:35.78]I knew you were going to be there because I memorized the level.
[29:41.00]Kitty cat opens the mouth here.
[29:46.95]Oh, come on, you fucking dickhead.
[29:54.87]Guy?
[29:59.80]You need to do more standing still.
[30:01.76]Is the problem.
[30:04.46]You're gonna come up behind... Wait, how do I get this?
[30:05.82]I have to dash.
[30:06.62]I have one health.
[30:10.92]Let's get it with one health.
[30:11.70]I really need to put the dash back on.
[30:14.61]Oh, no.
[30:15.63]Oh, God.
[30:20.25]Wait, what hit me?
[30:21.77]What the fuck was that?
[30:24.84]What happened there?
[30:29.60]Apparently, I guess I got hit by something.
[30:31.30]That was weird.
[30:35.24]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[30:41.65]See you later.
[30:44.01]Oh, what the fuck?
[30:45.53]Come on, you just like dropshotted me?
[30:48.91]I was certain he was gonna die.
[30:54.29]How would you quit this respawn bullshit?
[31:04.69]Just kill me.
[31:05.97]Just kill me.
[31:06.73]I'm not gonna get further than I did before and die.
[31:15.84]You know what?
[31:17.32]We're fucking, we're going with that.
[31:23.32]I have to put on the best ability in the whole game, hold on.
[31:30.06]Why would I ever have another fucking thing on?
[31:32.84]Everything else is fucking so awful in comparison.
[31:35.14]Because you get iframes.
[31:37.92]You can't replace iframes.
[31:55.65]Come on, let's go.
[32:00.03]Oh, god damn it!
[32:02.95]Fuck you.
[32:03.49]Look at this fucking happy horse shit.
[32:16.51]Alright, no, don't fuck this up.
[32:23.32]Gotta kill the dragon.
[32:24.12]Watch out for the weird fucking toxic Avenger.
[32:27.60]Holy shit.
[32:28.31]Okay.
[32:33.27]He's dead.
[32:38.97]Yep.
[32:41.09]Oh, I missed a coin!
[32:41.87]Shit!
[32:43.91]No, it's over.
[32:44.53]I missed a fucking coin.
[32:52.12]What do you do?
[32:53.52]You make, like, a funny face?
[33:02.60]I think these guys make sense.
[33:03.38]They're kind of like Satan goats, right?
[33:12.58]Come on, come on, come on.
[33:14.22]Don't spawn on me.
[33:15.34]I'm gonna get spawned.
[33:16.64]Someone's gonna spawn under my underpants.
[33:17.98]I know it.
[33:20.70]Coin, coin, coin.
[33:22.08]I know I missed a coin.
[33:24.54]There's nothing I can do about it.
[33:26.62]Besides go back.
[33:27.30]Let me just, I need to see the whole level first.
[33:29.76]Oh dear.
[33:30.84]What the hell is that thing?
[33:32.82]What is this fucking creepy guy that's just staring at me right now?
[33:35.54]He's gonna like put his hand over here and step on me with his dirty foot.
[33:38.54]I guarantee it.
[33:42.67]Don't do it.
[33:43.11]I know it's gonna happen.
[33:43.93]I'm fucking so paranoid.
[33:45.03]Oh, here he is.
[33:48.51]Great.
[33:51.64]Gotta shoot him right in the eye.
[33:53.00]No, you don't.
[33:53.54]You just have to avoid him.
[33:59.08]Do I have to kill this guy or am I gonna do this forever?
[34:02.95]Coin!
[34:03.35]Fuck!
[34:04.21]Don't.
[34:04.47]It's over.
[34:04.75]It's over.
[34:05.11]Don't even matter.
[34:05.75]I missed all the coins.
[34:12.79]I'm kind of scared.
[34:13.43]Do I have to keep doing this?
[34:23.00]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[34:24.19]Okay, well, that's it.
[34:25.51]I missed two coins.
[34:27.93]Did I miss two coins or three coins?
[34:33.99]Three coins gone.
[34:36.92]What a disaster.
[34:40.88]That's a C. Gotta restart the whole game, though.
[34:50.79]Well, it's alright.
[34:52.01]Don't worry about it.
[34:53.86]Hey, that Wolfgang.
[34:54.90]Always taking ten notes to express two notes worth of music.
[34:58.12]He has no conception of what I mean by less is more.
[35:01.28]I know you agree with me.
[35:02.15]Go convince that tin-earned clock.
[35:04.79]He won't listen to me anymore.
[35:07.53]The Junkyard.
[35:09.75]Junkyard Jive.
[35:16.09]Oh, there it is.
[35:16.69]There's Professor Farnsworth and Bender.
[35:20.66]Oh, Jesus.
[35:22.68]Okay, so that is a constant beam.
[35:25.70]Well, there's all other things happening here I need to be aware of.
[35:28.84]That thing has to die.
[35:33.43]Okay.
[35:34.47]So, figured it out.
[35:36.27]So there's three phases that happen back to back to back very quickly.
[35:41.81]The thing that comes out of his stomach, that thing's gotta go like E fucking immediately.
[35:46.20]I have to parry that as soon as it comes out.
[35:49.83]Because it has to turn off.
[35:51.11]Otherwise, it's going to be bad.
[35:56.97]Oh, shit.
[35:57.59]That's why... God, god, god, god, god, god, god, god.
[36:04.72]God damn it.
[36:07.36]I gotta shoot him right in his, like... This is where you gotta shoot him.
[36:11.36]Just for fun.
[36:12.52]Let's do it.
[36:13.56]Well, I fucked it up.
[36:15.88]You gotta break everything.
[36:16.90]I get it.
[36:17.40]I see.
[36:18.00]I feel you.
[36:18.58]I feel you.
[36:19.20]You gotta break the thing on the top.
[36:20.35]You gotta break the thing on his head.
[36:23.39]Or do you?
[36:25.25]I think you do.
[36:26.03]Yeah, you do.
[36:29.13]Aiming it up top is actually probably the best idea.
[36:33.70]And then he goes into his last phase, which I don't know what it is.
[36:38.96]There it is, okay.
[36:39.68]Whatever this phase is... We're not gonna see it!
[36:45.55]Hold on, what?
[36:48.15]This... Wait a second, I wasn't even... I wouldn't even pass the first phase?
[36:57.89]That's kind of interesting.
[37:02.66]We need to get that to shoot up.
[37:03.66]Except it's not going to.
[37:13.03]Shrink down to a little guy.
[37:15.59]Yeah, yeah.
[37:16.19]Go ahead.
[37:16.83]Say your funny lines, everybody.
[37:18.29]I know.
[37:18.81]I can't wait to hear them.
[37:23.64]Oh, shit.
[37:26.96]This is a bad spot.
[37:27.80]I gotta go down.
[37:33.04]That was a double.
[37:33.86]I got a double there.
[37:35.86]Okay, then get the head.
[37:36.87]In fact, let's just get this over with.
[37:45.81]Okay, now... Just get the fucking bomb out of the way, please.
[37:53.51]Fucking eat my asshole, seriously.
[37:55.92]Alright, that's just a lot to have to fucking... What is going on?
[38:01.74]I haven't even done 1%?
[38:07.34]Huh?
[38:09.51]Hold on a second.
[38:12.37]I don't understand.
[38:14.32]That has to be fucked up, right?
[38:15.77]Like, there's no way that's, like, not even 1% of this whole fight.
[38:22.45]Right?
[38:22.71]This has to go first.
[38:32.15]It's like... It has to be fucked.
[38:37.32]Oh, fucking god damn it.
[38:39.08]It's just like... This is... Hey.
[38:47.52]This has to go as soon as possible.
[38:49.42]It fucks up the whole thing.
[38:50.46]I already got hit.
[38:52.96]Oh my god.
[38:53.46]I'm gonna fucking seriously go... I'm gonna go fucking just smash my head into a wall.
[38:58.14]This is the problem.
[38:59.02]Not the thing on the top.
[38:59.98]Not that thing.
[39:00.52]It's these stupid fucking things that come out.
[39:09.09]Get out of here.
[39:12.40]The bombs are easy to deal with.
[39:13.42]You just have to glove them before they get out.
[39:17.03]You gotta be kidding me.
[39:17.99]Like, that little fucking dumbass pixel hit me.
[39:25.26]I'm just, like, angry.
[39:27.42]I gotta, like, fucking cool it.
[39:28.80]This game's, like, so much fun.
[39:29.98]I'm just like, fuck this game.
[39:30.86]This game's stupid.
[39:31.45]That's a dumb thing.
[39:32.01]I don't even like this.
[39:32.65]I hate this.
[39:44.32]It's not even that bad.
[39:45.90]It's right when the skulls come out, they go.
[39:48.40]Just move around.
[39:49.26]They're very slow projectiles.
[39:51.32]It's not even a huge problem.
[39:53.06]Oh my god.
[40:02.05]Okay, well, we do it all over again.
[40:08.25]Just take it easy.
[40:09.05]Take it slow.
[40:11.19]Don't fucking rush anything.
[40:12.55]This is obviously the long one.
[40:16.74]Stay here and shoot.
[40:18.36]Alright.
[40:20.54]You know what to do.
[40:22.82]Get his chest.
[40:25.09]Yeah.
[40:26.53]There, he broke it himself.
[40:32.15]Bait it around.
[40:37.95]Come on They fucking smashed into each other it's not my fault that they have a fucking traffic jam fuck you.
[40:47.35]Oh my god.

[41:07.87]If somebody gave $100, hold on, I'd be like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[41:10.34]We gotta do this correct.
[41:18.22]What a pain in the ass.
[41:23.61]I, like, don't even want to break that first.
[41:26.17]These bombs are not fun.

[48:47.69]No, they cannot.
[48:54.85]Get cocky.
[48:55.89]Alright, here it comes.
[48:56.75]Do this one in the back.
[48:58.77]There we go.
[49:01.10]Get cocky.
[49:03.80]Dude, she's up all night to get fun.
[49:05.88]I'm up all night to get some.
[49:07.72]She's up all night to get fucking cocky.
[49:11.21]I'm sorry, that was fucking terrible.
[49:16.80]Oh, that was... I wasn't even trying with that one.
[49:25.50]Eat shit!
[49:31.29]Oh, what?
[49:32.37]Oh, this is where I forgot what... Okay, what the hell happens here?
[49:36.59]Okay, I get it.
[49:37.45]I can see where he shoots the fucking flames out.
[49:41.85]He's gonna shoot the flames out here.
[49:43.06]I guess, right?
[49:46.00]Yeah.
[49:46.16]He's gonna come down.
[49:49.78]You can see this thing spinning, but what does that mean exactly?
[49:52.04]What does it mean?
[49:52.60]What does it all mean?
[49:54.50]What happened to that cow?
[49:56.47]The cat comes in and eats him.
[49:58.97]Holy shit.
[50:00.01]Okay.
[50:04.23]What?! !
[50:09.70]He like spaghettis his arm around the corner?
[50:12.76]What the fuck?
[50:16.60]Okay, well, good to know.
[50:20.35]I know I understand that part.
[50:29.01]That was crazy.
[50:40.12]Not bad.
[50:40.76]Not a big deal.
[50:43.09]Here it comes.
[50:44.27]Who cares about parrying when you can just do damage?
[50:47.59]That's what I say.
[50:50.13]When he gets in the middle, you've got to be careful.
[50:53.33]Is this where he comes?
[50:54.79]Yes, it is.
[50:56.16]Just don't get up there with him.
[50:58.52]Just watch the blades and you'll be dandy.
[51:03.67]Yeah, like that.
[51:04.71]See his blade coming over here too.
[51:06.63]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[51:12.15]Okay, I'm fine.
[51:13.19]Everything's fine.
[51:13.79]Alright, here he goes.
[51:16.25]Time for the cat.
[51:17.67]Now watch out for the cat.
[51:21.11]The cat's like giant, like fucking 22 foot arm.
[51:25.39]Alright, that's what it means.
[51:26.20]So whatever side he reaches on, you gotta get to the other side.
[51:29.56]And then the two ghost rats come out.
[51:33.91]Should be pretty close here.
[51:35.09]This should be it.
[51:43.55]Oh, fuck.
[51:43.91]These guys can die.
[51:44.85]Okay, I didn't even know they could be attacked.
[51:46.76]That's it.
[51:48.10]Okay.
[51:48.34]Oh, he's inside the whole time.
[51:51.40]What?
[51:51.58]Alright, well, that's it.
[51:56.60]That was cool.
[51:58.40]That was a cool fight.
[51:59.86]That was not bad.
[52:00.90]Once you figure out what the hell's going on.
[52:08.36]This game is fucking wild, man.
[52:13.82]I love it.
[52:17.20]Alright, so that's it.
[52:18.74]That's all the bosses.
[52:19.50]Now I have to beat the game.
[52:25.94]Werner Werman.
[52:28.97]Which brings us to... Alright, so what did I get on my report card so far?
[52:36.88]First term, I did okay.
[52:37.94]First semester, I did alright.
[52:40.78]Now, these are terms.
[52:41.30]So, this would be one semester.
[52:42.30]This would be four terms.
[52:44.99]I did pretty good on my first term.
[52:46.41]My, like, ribby and croaks could have been a little bit better.
[52:51.01]But, that class was... I just kind of breezed through that one.
[52:54.58]Term two, I got a little lazy in term two.
[52:58.25]Still B's, but some C's.
[52:59.75]Now that's like math and science.
[53:01.27]I kind of like didn't care.
[53:02.07]And then, you know, my parents really, really got upset with me and I really turned it around.
[53:06.59]But it's, I still, still have problems.
[53:09.63]You know?
[53:12.83]Still have issues that need to be sorted out.
[53:17.19]Term two is pretty rough.
[53:21.43]B minus in term three.
[53:22.59]I had like, I had A's in term one.
[53:25.64]Well, I have five coins.
[53:27.04]What can I buy?
[53:29.46]Long bad joke.
[53:31.85]Yeah.
[53:33.17]Pretty much.
[53:40.53]First power move is automatic.
[53:41.63]What do I need to buy here?
[53:43.10]Does anything?
[53:43.54]Doesn't matter.
[53:46.76]Fix the sound?
[53:47.64]What do you mean fix sound?
[53:48.76]Oh.
[53:49.70]How long have I been that low?
[53:52.36]When did that happen?
[53:55.37]Has that been like that for, like, fucking... How long has that been like that for?
[53:58.49]I'm sorry about that.
[54:01.21]It must have just did that.
[54:03.18]A while.
[54:08.52]Um... I'm gonna get this just in case I need it, because I might.
[54:21.47]My sound is fine.
[54:23.07]Yeah.
[54:28.84]Alright.
[54:32.10]So let's go see what's going on at the end here.
[54:35.84]In my entire streaming career.
[54:40.74]Casino entrance.
[54:44.30]We've beaten all the bosses in all the worlds.
[54:47.31]It's time to go in the giant casino.
[54:49.87]And see what the hell the devil wants me to do.
[54:54.43]Why is this locked?
[54:57.96]I probably get a key or something.
[55:01.50]All bets are off.
[55:03.98]You can't do this on simple, huh?
[55:06.71]Well, looky here.
[55:07.61]You actually pulled it off, but you made me lose a bet.
[55:10.83]And for that, you ain't seeing the boss just yet.
[55:13.21]We're gonna play a little game first.
[55:15.67]Right, of course.
[55:18.25]Okay.
[55:18.55]12 for one.
[55:21.69]Dude, this is like roulette.
[55:23.71]We roll the dice.
[55:24.41]180 for one.
[55:28.97]What just happened?
[55:34.38]We gotta go against, like, the shit-faced booze glasses.
[55:36.90]Okay.
[55:37.88]Oh, boy.
[55:38.84]Well... Oh, my God.
[55:41.68]Well, this is where we instantly die.
[55:44.22]It's been fun, guys.
[55:44.98]It's been real.
[55:49.62]Maybe not instantly.
[55:51.08]Pretty close to it, though.
[55:52.10]Yeah, well, instantly.
[55:55.22]Well, let's try that again.
[55:58.91]So what, is it like an RNG thing?
[56:00.39]You roll the dice and you get a different boss or something?
[56:03.27]It has to be what it is.
[56:06.02]Three.
[56:06.34]It's gonna be something different.
[56:08.22]This is gonna take us a little while.
[56:12.22]Alright, this is a sausage.
[56:15.24]This is like old man sausage.
[56:19.90]Can those be hit?
[56:20.96]I don't think so.
[56:21.46]Alright, he batters himself in like beer batter.
[56:29.23]Not that bad once you know what's going on.
[56:30.57]Fuck.
[56:33.17]Nothing I can do about that.
[56:34.01]I had to just dash across.
[56:42.55]Mm-hmm.
[56:42.89]He's gonna go across again.
[56:43.95]This guy's got a lot of health.
[56:53.11]There we go.
[56:55.03]Oh, he just steps on it.
[57:01.86]I'm gonna do it again.
[57:03.81]Clear.
[57:04.19]12 for 1.
[57:07.15]Safe.
[57:07.49]Like, 4.
[57:08.17]Is any of that stuff... Okay, 3.
[57:10.36]6 health up.
[57:13.98]I guess I'm understanding this somehow.
[57:16.76]Slightly.
[57:17.20]Maybe not, no.
[57:18.44]Oh, there's the magician.
[57:20.27]I already love this boss.
[57:23.21]Alright, easy.
[57:24.42]Easy.
[57:25.86]Okay, I get it.
[57:28.00]You gotta go through.
[57:28.80]Oh, okay.
[57:31.16]Didn't get that quite so fast, but it's alright.
[57:37.91]Oh, goddammit.
[57:38.65]Goddammit, goddammit, goddammit, goddammit!
[57:40.27]It's hard when it's up top like that.
[57:52.13]That's so much better.
[57:53.59]When it's at the top, not the bottom.
[57:58.02]Just dash through it.
[57:58.68]Yeah, this is not that bad.
[58:04.64]Okay.
[58:05.22]Give me some more.
[58:09.56]Try to time the dice roll, so I'll see what I can do.
[58:13.80]So, I need... One... Two.
[58:16.92]So I need a two, right?
[58:18.06]To be safe?
[58:19.76]One, two, one... Fuck!
[58:23.46]I get health, right?
[58:24.90]Oh shit, goddammit.
[58:26.00]Like, I'm sitting there trying to time the dice roll and I do another... Well, we're in deep shit.
[58:34.41]I gotta just do this now.
[58:35.19]Watch out for the presents.
[58:42.44]Don't get fucking hit by anything.
[58:48.18]Of course I get hit by the thing behind me.
[58:53.56]Fucking dumb present horse.
[59:02.22]Well, okay.
[59:03.50]I gotta health up.
[59:05.00]And you gotta get all the way to the end.
[59:10.11]I gotta get this one down.
[59:16.13]Oh my god.
[59:17.05]This is the worst one by far.
[59:19.75]You don't have very much time at all.
[59:21.11]And you gotta get rid of these stupid fucking flying Monster Hunter monsters.
[59:25.77]No, fuck that.
[59:27.35]It's not gonna happen.
[59:32.71]I gotta get to like three.
[59:35.76]How do I not time this right?
[59:37.80]Like seriously.
[59:39.00]Jesus.
[59:42.24]Bring it on.
[59:44.35]They telegraph so hard.
[59:45.39]I know.
[59:45.71]I just... My brain... This one's easy.
[59:48.42]I'll be alright with this one.
[59:58.42]Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[60:01.02]I could just go for threes every time, you know?
[60:03.03]We'll see.
[60:03.35]Oh, fuck!
[60:07.81]What was I thinking?
[60:08.57]Okay.
[60:13.66]Okay, we're fine.
[60:19.77]I like waited way too long there.
[60:23.21]Knockout.
[60:25.77]Come on.
[60:27.69]Come on.
[60:29.41]There it is.
[60:34.85]Marge Simpson.
[60:38.01]Okay, I want two.
[60:39.69]We're looking for two.
[60:42.99]Two.
[60:44.98]There it is.
[60:45.78]Health up.
[60:48.28]Do not give me the alcohol, people.
[60:52.84]Oh, shit.
[60:53.60]What is this?
[60:56.88]Just moves?
[61:04.08]Okay, not bad so far.
[61:05.14]What the fuck do you do?
[61:10.50]God damn it.
[61:21.00]Can't parry that thing.
[61:22.02]Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[61:36.89]Not bad.
[61:37.59]It's alright.
[61:38.15]It's just about patterns and timing.
[61:50.95]And a little bit of nuance.
[61:57.40]There it is.
[61:57.80]Alright, we're good.
[62:02.38]Look at this big boy with five health.
[62:03.84]What's the next health?
[62:06.44]Nine.
[62:06.96]So let's, let's, we gotta go for one, two, we gotta go for three.
[62:09.58]Three.
[62:13.05]There it is.
[62:13.59]Safe.
[62:15.45]Safety.
[62:17.53]We're gonna go if we need three again.
[62:21.02]Give me that health.
[62:22.86]Bingo.
[62:24.12]6 HP.
[62:24.64]Come on.
[62:26.16]Come on.
[62:29.74]Oh shit, it's a random monkey.
[62:33.43]I can't hurt him.
[62:34.35]What?
[62:34.63]Okay, there's cards.
[62:36.43]It's just a match game.
[62:37.59]That's all it is.
[62:40.47]Oh fuck, okay.
[62:41.11]There's the MD one.
[62:41.99]No, not that one.
[62:47.74]Shit.
[62:48.82]God damn it.
[62:50.48]I'm terrible at this shit.
[62:52.19]I gotta just find the one that I need to find.
[62:54.17]There it is.
[62:55.25]What happened?
[62:57.54]I won?
[62:57.86]I beat it.
[63:10.10]Okay, we need one two- OH DON'T DO A TWO!
[63:13.60]DON'T DO A TWO!
[63:14.96]I NEED A THREE!
[63:16.26]I NEED A THREE!
[63:17.22]NOT A TWO!
[63:19.36]DAMMIT!
[63:34.96]Just roll everything I already rolled.
[63:36.60]Give me a three.
[63:40.94]What's wrong with me?
[63:41.66]Why can I do this?
[63:46.90]Now I need a two.
[63:52.47]Something about this is fucking me up so bad right now.
[63:55.11]I'm so sorry.
[63:56.73]It's okay.
[63:57.11]I need a one or two.
[63:58.07]I gotta blink.
[64:00.57]Give me safety.
[64:01.25]That's fine.
[64:04.09]Give me a one.
[64:05.20]One, two, three.
[64:05.78]I need a fucking one.
[64:09.60]One, two, three.
[64:11.67]Give me a three.
[64:15.87]Three.
[64:19.37]Three again.
[64:19.91]And then three again.
[64:25.93]This is fine now, we're good.
[64:29.75]Doesn't matter what it is, it's safe no matter what.
[64:34.21]Finish.
[64:36.62]Time to... What?
[64:41.56]What the fuck, man?
[64:42.62]You're not gonna give me a second to get my shit together?
[64:44.60]Just parry.
[64:51.93]I got a full thing.
[65:02.27]Do it again, fine.
[65:03.15]It's not that bad.
[65:10.34]You ain't got a thing if you ain't got that swing.
[65:18.26]What?
[65:29.33]You gotta be getting close, man.
[65:30.33]Get the fuck out of here.
[65:33.11]And you two little sock puppets.
[65:37.77]Ugh.
[65:40.82]I can't believe it went all the way back.
[65:43.30]That just didn't need to happen, man.
[65:44.74]It really didn't.
[65:57.85]Final term?
[65:58.33]I don't know.
[65:59.15]We're doing okay on the final term.
[66:02.43]Do I have a ghost streamer playing for me?
[66:04.52]No.
[66:08.64]Solid B. Alright, so this is it, right?
[66:12.40]Now I gotta go into the Devil's bathroom.
[66:17.25]This is the final fight.
[66:18.07]It has to be, right?
[66:20.09]God, get ready for me to sit here for probably like an hour.
[66:23.13]One hell of a time.
[66:24.21]The Devil.
[66:30.66]Well, well, well.
[66:31.80]Look how far you've come.
[66:33.76]Not only did you bust up my good-for-nothing lackey King Dias,
[66:37.78]But I see you've got my soul contracts.
[66:41.00]As agreed.
[66:42.26]Hand them over and join my team.
[66:46.18]Is it choice?
[66:51.14]Does it matter what you say here?
[66:53.80]Wait, am I gonna get like this shitty ending where you don't fight the devil or something?
[67:01.21]Here.
[67:04.41]I'm saying yes.
[67:25.13]Oh, shit!
[67:28.07]Wait, no, wait a minute, wait.
[67:29.73]I wanna go fight the devil.
[67:31.39]I thought that was... Wait, hold on, wait.
[67:34.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[67:39.02]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[67:46.86]Huh?
[67:48.62]Why is my controller not working anymore?
[67:54.20]What happened?
[67:54.70]Why can I not play the game anymore?
[68:00.91]Yes, I know I'm using the controller.
[68:02.19]Huh?
[68:16.42]I can't do anything.
[68:26.62]What?
[68:29.48]Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[68:30.46]Wait, wait a second.
[68:31.62]That's not true.
[68:33.34]That's not true.
[68:34.59]I can go do that again.
[68:37.75]Okay, we're fine.
[68:38.51]Everything's fine.
[68:39.03]Don't worry.
[68:44.44]Okay, here we are.
[68:46.24]Start.
[68:47.28]Aisle four.
[68:48.32]See?
[68:48.88]Everything's fine.
[68:50.18]I just had to, like, rip the fucking cord out.
[68:53.24]See?
[68:53.50]There we go.
[68:54.12]Okay.
[68:55.92]I was gonna say, that would be really disappointing if I couldn't, like, fight the devil one hell of a time.
[69:02.99]Well, remember when I did this thing and I said leaned in?
[69:05.69]I said, let me see those contracts.
[69:07.69]What?
[69:08.87]You're not gonna give me the deal?
[69:10.41]Oh, I'll kill you.
[69:11.53]Okay, here we go.
[69:15.89]Let's go, devil.
[69:18.17]A brawl is surely brewing.
[69:20.19]A brawl is surely brewing.
[69:24.07]Gross hands.
[69:24.83]Yeah, a cat comes up.
[69:27.61]Okay.
[69:28.51]So he's like a spider that flies around.
[69:30.17]Alright, that has a lot of reach.
[69:34.15]That's a huge hitbox.
[69:35.67]Good to know.
[69:36.05]What else you got?
[69:38.11]You got long arms?
[69:39.01]Alright, you got the long arms.
[69:40.61]There it is.
[69:44.38]Can you hit him anywhere?
[69:45.04]Do you have to hit him in the head?
[69:45.78]You have to hit him in the head.
[69:46.58]Oh, alright.
[69:48.71]But when he puts his... It's only on the bottom.
[69:52.29]That works.
[69:53.85]This is new.
[69:55.19]Alright, he's got a little fireball synth there.
[69:58.29]Why am I calling it synths?
[70:01.49]Big hands is where he gets the big head, and it's a big hitbox, so just watch yourself.
[70:04.91]Don't get hit by the spider head.
[70:07.11]It's a very large hitbox.
[70:14.51]Those guys are going to keep running the whole time, aren't they?
[70:16.39]Alright, up.
[70:20.57]Whoa, now.
[70:21.73]Hold on there.
[70:22.45]You've got to time that perfectly.
[70:24.63]Shit.
[70:28.37]You've got to time that perfectly.
[70:30.09]Let's see how far I am here, though.
[70:35.94]I'm going to have to do it a couple more times, probably.
[70:37.72]Alright.
[70:42.30]Well.
[70:45.49]Can I... Can I duck underneath that?
[70:48.17]This is new.
[70:50.07]What the fuck are you doing?
[70:51.51]God damn it.
[70:53.19]Oh my god.
[70:54.03]Oh god.
[70:54.61]Well, let's do it again.
[70:56.63]We gotta see all his moves before I can do it.
[71:03.77]Ooh!
[71:05.53]Nice.
[71:05.91]Okay.
[71:06.91]I'll keep that in mind.
[71:10.73]That was a terrible place to start.
[71:14.13]Should have just dashed, but whatever.
[71:17.27]Fuck!
[71:17.83]Ah, it's... You gotta be quick.
[71:19.53]You gotta be fast.
[71:29.99]Fuck.
[71:30.29]We're just gonna use shotgun.
[71:31.24]Alright, here's the snake.
[71:35.90]Fuck.
[71:37.90]I had... That's the right idea, but gotta get it in the right spot.
[71:49.10]Being the right place for this Spider Bring it on next phase Next phase, let's see it.
[72:12.17]What do you got devil?
[72:17.97]Fuck, that asshole just ran right into me.
[72:21.33]This sticks around for a while too.
[72:23.97]Wooohooohooo!
[72:26.71]I was right about to pass into the next phase.
[72:29.40]Alright.
[72:38.26]Fuck me.
[72:39.84]I don't know what to do about that one.
[72:41.90]You gotta like stand in the right spot maybe?
[72:48.79]Try to get this as fast as we can.
[72:54.00]Really?
[72:54.38]You fucking really?
[72:55.34]Oh, you fucking really?
[73:00.44]I think I'm gonna put the charge shot on.
[73:03.28]We're gonna do charge shot.
[73:04.34]Last attempt here and then putting on the other weapon.
[73:17.35]Come on.
[73:23.92]Just got to keep your eye on it the whole time.
[73:33.28]Clap your hands.
[73:34.06]Nope.
[73:34.56]There's a fucking snake head.
[73:35.40]Let me figure this out.
[73:37.48]Ah, yeah, yeah.
[73:37.96]You got to walk.
[73:38.62]You got to walk to the left.
[73:40.16]Oh, I don't like that.
[73:41.54]That's too awkward.
[73:43.74]Let's try to get to the next phase.
[73:48.11]Let's just get there.
[73:48.87]Next phase.
[73:52.83]No.
[73:59.07]There we go.
[73:59.95]Oh, well, his skeleton comes out of his body in the second phase.
[74:03.52]But let's get the charge shot on.
[74:05.68]Let's make this a real attempt.
[74:06.84]What do you say?
[74:11.98]This one.
[74:15.82]That should be good.
[74:21.93]Alright.
[74:23.07]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[74:23.99]No, no, no.
[74:27.36]It's a little too spooky.
[74:29.32]It is very spooky, you're right.
[74:37.28]That was like a split second off.
[74:44.91]I like just barely didn't get hit by that one.
[74:49.51]That was fucking lucky.
[74:50.37]Alright.
[74:54.72]You can avoid that if you go all the way to the other side of the screen.
[75:07.27]Next one.
[75:07.87]Alright.
[75:15.83]Oh!
[75:17.67]That was kind of lucky.
[75:18.57]Alright.
[75:19.05]Get your bones out of here.
[75:19.79]Here comes the head.
[75:22.01]Come on.
[75:32.99]There he comes.
[75:33.39]Okay.
[75:33.61]Skeleton Man.
[75:34.23]What do you got?
[75:35.69]Oh!
[75:35.89]What?
[75:36.01]There's no end.
[75:36.47]Go!
[75:38.52]There's no, like, animation there.
[75:39.49]He just falls in.
[75:40.55]Ah, yai, yai.
[75:41.17]Whatever.
[75:42.67]Woo-hoo!
[75:47.59]I don't know what hits you here.
[75:51.65]Will his head hit me?
[76:00.10]He did something with his eye there.
[76:07.93]Oh, come on!
[76:19.83]What?!
[76:21.81]Okay, well, that's new.
[76:24.33]Almost there.
[76:28.49]I tried to, like, slap the bomb and... Oh, that's such a poor ship.
[76:31.26]It's alright.
[76:41.76]Mm-hmm.
[76:45.04]Get over here.
[76:45.58]Oh, you fucking little shit.
[76:54.86]Oh, fuck you.
[76:55.58]That's such bullshit.
[76:56.44]Get out of here.
[77:00.08]Stupid little asshole running around the fucking bottom of the screen.
[77:04.78]Get out of here.
[77:06.63]You fucking annoying little shit.
[77:15.84]Oh my god, I fucking hate those little fucks on the bottom.
[77:21.15]Those stupid fucking enemies.
[77:24.35]They're just there so you make sure you forget they exist.
[77:27.39]You little fucks.
[77:39.73]Get over here.
[77:41.62]Not this time, come on.
[77:42.90]I'm not gonna get hit by this skeleton either.
[77:48.61]I have an itchy forehead.
[77:56.75]He's gonna come back.
[77:58.03]Two of them.
[77:59.07]Right?
[78:00.39]I guess not.
[78:06.47]Come on!
[78:06.88]He wasn't even on the right fucking side!
[78:08.42]He wasn't even on this side!
[78:10.94]Oh!
[78:13.06]Oh, that's fucking infuriating to me.
[78:16.84]Fuck you.
[78:18.17]Get out of here.
[78:20.35]Oh my fucking god.
[78:37.72]These guys, you get rid of those enemies and then fuck it, I would not be in a meltdown like I am right now.
[78:44.56]If those guys couldn't be attacked, I would just, like... Ugh.
[78:47.56]God.
[78:48.24]Fuck.
[78:48.52]Just... I need to be quiet here.
[78:49.56]Let's get to phase two.
[78:54.51]Come on.
[79:06.05]Do the clap.
[79:10.11]Oh!
[79:11.29]Oh!
[79:11.63]Oh!
[79:11.95]Oh!
[79:12.13]Oh!
[79:12.37]Oh!
[79:16.39]Why?
[79:16.93]Why every fucking time?
[79:21.50]I'm doing that wrong, too.
[79:29.28]Here he goes.
[79:32.00]Fucking god, you piece of shit game.
[79:37.03]Give me a break.
[79:37.83]Why does that thing stick around?
[79:55.01]Damn it.
[79:55.37]I'm like on tilt right now.
[79:56.59]Fuck you devil.
[79:58.07]You suck If you get hit in the first you gotta you gotta start over you just have to you can't get hit in the first phase There's too much crazy shit.
[80:11.55]I haven't seen yet Oh
[80:26.57]Dammit.
[80:27.05]You just have to worry.
[80:27.85]Worrying about these little purple fucks, man, just ruins the whole thing for me.
[80:32.12]Alright, let me fucking figure this out.
[80:43.60]So, okay, alright, alright.
[80:44.95]So if you get in the spot, you can't move.
[80:47.41]But here's the problem with that, right?
[80:48.99]I'm gonna give you the problem with that.
[80:51.09]Those little purple fucks, you can't shoot them.
[80:54.51]So they're gonna run into you if they're on the screen.
[80:56.35]Because you can't shoot through the devil's fucking snake body.
[80:59.55]So what, like you just saw, what the fuck am I supposed to do about that?
[81:10.54]Stupid purple little assholes.
[81:21.63]God fucking dammit.
[81:23.51]This is like the B boss all over again.
[81:25.15]There's a bunch of fucking trash that I don't want to deal with.
[81:30.16]Here he comes again.
[81:45.85]Oh, I'm so angry at this.
[81:47.47]I fucking hate the stupid purple guys.
[81:50.31]Why do they have to do that?
[81:53.09]Why do they have to come out in this frequency?
[81:55.01]Oh my god, eat my fucking ass.
[82:00.53]It's so stupid.
[82:08.17]Wait a minute, so you get hit by that regardless?
[82:09.71]Ahhhh.
[82:32.75]We're gonna be here for like three hours.
[82:34.13]We're gonna be here for like fuckin' six hours.
[82:48.38]Watch this side of the screen, this fuckin' little- this little- little fucking dickhead.
[82:52.46]Oh, my- my fuckin' blood is on fire right now.
[83:00.23]The temperature of my blood is like 800 degrees.
[83:19.39]I don't wanna do anything funny right now.
[83:20.73]Nothing fancy.
[83:26.88]Here comes the skeleton man.
[83:30.22]Nope.
[83:31.72]Fuck it.
[83:32.10]I ain't even fucking playing around.
[83:33.06]Alright, this is where- I gotta get to this phase again.
[83:40.50]Wooo!
[83:45.20]How much longer is this gonna be?
[83:46.24]Come on, man!
[83:51.89]Here he comes, he's gonna jump down.
[83:52.69]Alright, go in here!
[83:54.97]Here we go!
[83:55.87]Go!
[83:57.57]Ugh!
[83:58.97]I'm gonna lose here, dude.
[84:00.04]Quiet!
[84:00.70]Shh, do it.
[84:05.66]I didn't know that would stick.
[84:29.26]No, no, no, no!
[84:31.24]Ugh!
[84:35.80]This part really ain't that bad.
[84:44.55]These guys take one hit.
[84:48.85]Hmm...
[85:01.56]I get there again, I'll do it.
[85:22.01]Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!
[85:24.75]God damn it!
[85:27.23]Fuck you.
[85:28.41]Oh, fuck you.
[85:29.75]They have to spawn them down here, don't they?
[85:48.33]God you fucking idiot.
[85:49.61]Oh my god.
[85:50.57]I'm so angry I'm so on like like you shook the fucking pinball machine To a point where not the not to the point where you got like in trouble to the point where you got arrested You're sitting there just fucking shaking it back and forth the pinball machine is on such tilt that like they come over and they want you to leave but you you're gonna get arrested to how hard you're shaking that pinball machine
[86:16.93]Like, you're in deep fucking trouble.
[86:18.17]You're going to jail for as much as you shook that thing.
[86:24.25]I would parry, but no, just don't even.
[86:35.64]God, the fucking snake!
[86:38.52]Ugh!
[86:39.62]Ugh, my body hurts!
[86:43.97]The purple guy was... Let's go.
[86:49.38]I'm fucking doing it right now.
[86:50.52]No more messing around.
[86:51.58]God damn it.
[86:55.87]Alright, quiet!
[87:13.42]Get rid of the two guys.
[87:15.87]Here they come.
[87:18.63]Nope, it's just one.
[87:33.81]My fucking finger flipped off the... My fucking finger... Fucking purple, guys!
[87:40.95]And here comes a fucking stupid snake!
[87:43.43]My finger is so wet right now.
[87:45.09]My hands are fucking wet from this fucking coffee.
[87:53.74]I got it.
[87:54.20]It's not... I got it.
[87:55.38]It's gonna happen.
[87:57.06]Don't worry.
[88:03.28]I'm shutting up.
[88:04.50]Run.
[88:31.94]There he goes.
[88:32.62]Full health.
[88:33.42]Bring it on.
[88:33.84]I ain't fucking around.
[88:35.50]Get him.
[88:36.76]Let me get the sweat off my hands.
[88:38.67]Quick.
[88:38.85]I don't have time to get sweat.
[88:40.01]Calm down.
[88:46.57]Fuck it.
[88:47.71]Charge another one.
[89:19.36]Cry for me!
[89:22.26]How was I supposed to dodge that shit?
[89:24.74]Oh!
[89:25.02]Get... Get me out of here.
[89:33.22]I did it!
[89:33.62]I win!
[89:34.94]I win!
[89:49.13]That's all, folks.
[89:52.71]The brothers had triumphed over the demon, forcing him to finally give up.
[89:57.24]We shall accept your surrender.
[89:58.88]Who cares about voices?
[90:00.15]At this point, Cuphead laughed at him, but we're not done just yet.
[90:04.53]And with that, Cuphead and Mugman destroyed all the soul contracts, releasing Inkwell Isle's residents from eternal servitude to the devil.
[90:12.94]Gosh, I can't wait to tell everybody, Cuphead said.
[90:16.04]The boys set off for home, and at the top speed, said, Come on, last one, there's a leaky cup.
[90:22.00]Mugman teased as they were the same voice.
[90:23.86]Who cares?
[90:25.20]Once home, the brothers gathered everyone together.
[90:27.48]You're all free of the devil's debt.
[90:29.68]But, Cuphead announced, and that fiend won't bother us ever again, Mugman added, with the same people.
[90:37.33]The Elder Kettle was literally brimming with pride as everyone began to cheer.
[90:40.31]Let's hear it for those two that beat Cuphead on stream.
[90:43.33]Hip hip hooray.
[90:47.24]Since an all-day celebration began, the brothers promised to never wander into trouble again.
[90:51.41]And they didn't until the next time, of course, but that's another story for the DLC.
[90:57.73]The end.
[91:02.07]Those two.
[91:03.81]Who invited the bee to the party?
[91:05.03]I agree.
[91:09.43]Our sincere appreciation to the members of our team, whose loyalty and creative endeavor made possible this production.
[91:14.39]Chad and Jared Moldenhauer.
[91:18.50]And they did a great job.
[91:21.81]They did a great job.
[91:24.09]I would say this was a lot of fun.
[91:28.45]20 bucks.
[91:30.33]How long did it take me to beat it?
[91:31.41]Like, just about 5 hours?
[91:32.71]I was streaming for like 4 hours?
[91:37.19]Can I see?
[91:37.75]Like, is there a way for me to tell?
[91:40.64]Like, how long I've been... I think I played it for... I streamed it and played it for, like, four hours last week.
[91:46.71]And just about, like, what, an hour and ten minutes?
[91:48.21]An hour and twenty minutes?
[91:54.39]I hope it's 95% now.
[91:56.07]Check the deaths.
[92:02.66]I streamed six hours!
[92:03.86]Oh, no, I didn't.
[92:05.80]I definitely didn't go for six hours last time.
[92:07.38]It was, like, four hours and, like, thirty minutes or something.
[92:11.04]Check the death count?
[92:11.68]Let's just go to the death count.
[92:12.56]Uh, let me see something here.
[92:23.54]Okay, let's go look at the death count.
[92:27.54]It's like a well somewhere, right?
[92:29.99]Do expert mode?
[92:31.17]No.
[92:33.87]Play on the non-easy mode?
[92:35.33]What do you mean non-easy mode?
[92:38.08]Oh, dear.
[92:38.46]Alright, you know what?
[92:39.22]I'll try a couple things on Expert.
[92:40.78]We'll see.
[92:42.10]Let's go back to like the first boss and do it on Expert and hate ourselves.
[92:47.25]Oh, but we're going to take a second here because people are here.
[92:50.05]I'm going to talk about, very briefly, because there's not much I really can talk about because it hasn't happened yet.
[92:57.16]Expert B?
[92:57.74]Oh, fuck me.
[93:01.10]Before I say anything, Cuphead, great game.
[93:03.34]I highly recommend it.
[93:04.60]You're going to rage.
[93:05.78]You're going to be angry.
[93:07.65]But it's a very fun experience to play through the whole thing.
[93:10.93]So, I was in Los Angeles this last weekend here.
[93:14.73]I was out there because Warner Brothers and Machinima, there's like an opportunity there to potentially do some cool shit.
[93:28.02]You know, all these videos that you've been waiting for, all these things I've been talking about over the last couple of years.
[93:33.10]You know, Jerma Rumble Live, oh, that was so much fun.
[93:35.24]I wish I had, like, more money.
[93:36.30]I wish I had more stuff.
[93:37.86]There's an opportunity now to be able to do this.
[93:42.04]Potentially, there's a potential opportunity here underneath Warner Brothers.
[93:46.16]And, like, now Machinima, because Machinima's owned by Warner Brothers now.
[93:48.68]They bought them.
[93:50.55]so this is like of course this is not enough I haven't like signed any papers yet it was just going out there just to check out some stuff and see like you know opportunity wise if it's something I want to do um it's it has a lot of potential
[94:08.36]And, yeah, no, like, trust me, I get it.
[94:12.88]I get it.
[94:13.76]And for me to do what I want to do out there, I want to do it the way I want to do it.
[94:20.01]And if it's going to be something that I'm going to do, get, like, resources to be able to do it, I'm going to do it.
[94:25.63]Like, I'm going to do it the way that I want to, right?
[94:29.38]If it's something I'm not interested in, and something I don't feel like putting my time into, I'm not going to do it.
[94:34.68]Just abso-fucking-lutely not.
[94:35.76]I hope you guys have been around for long enough to know that I'm just not going to sign papers and be like, Yeah, I don't give a fuck.
[94:43.04]Give me some money and I don't care.
[94:46.60]This is just a win-win for me, potentially.
[94:50.04]Because all the stuff that I want to do, all the new wrestling videos, all this other shit that you guys don't even know about yet, are projects that can now potentially happen.
[95:01.83]So, I don't know.
[95:05.65]The Warner Brothers and Machinima are the Dice Man and the Devil.
[95:11.86]But that's the thing.
[95:14.92]like this is this is like a new like opportunity a new because look Warner Brothers is just barely getting into this right like they bought machinima last year barely and now they're I mean I guess like the wheels are turning for all these different things like oh let's do this let's do that so I don't know my hands are kind of up in the air right now like just kind of like whatever because at this point we talked about what I want to do and like the things that I care about and
[95:45.20]if it ends up working out, and, oh yeah, like, look at all this fucking studio space I can use now.
[95:50.25]Like, that's fucking awesome.
[95:52.37]I don't have to drop, like, fucking 20 grand, 10 grand of, like, my own savings to make, like, Jerma Rumble Live 2.
[95:58.69]I don't have to do that.
[96:01.36]Like, there's, like, actual space.
[96:03.12]There's actual opportunity.
[96:06.70]So that's where I was.
[96:07.76]That's what I was doing out there.
[96:09.22]Just nothing set in stone.
[96:10.36]No details or anything.
[96:12.36]But that's... There's a potential opportunity with Warner Brothers and Machinima to be able to do something new.
[96:20.75]And if it works out, it works out.
[96:21.77]And if it doesn't, then there's other things that I will figure out, right?
[96:30.20]As long...
[96:34.01]And people talking about, like, contracts, read the con- Guys, don't- Guys, I got, like, six lawyers.
[96:38.78]I got, like, six lawyers.
[96:40.78]Dude, guys, my lawyers have lawyers.
[96:42.68]You know what I'm saying?
[96:44.26]So don't worry.
[96:45.42]I'm gonna be alright.
[96:48.42]And it, like, matters to me that whatever I do is something that I would've done anyways.
[96:52.54]You know?
[96:55.01]I can't just do something just because.
[96:58.57]I'm not going to do something just because, because I have like very, very specific things that I want to do.
[97:02.27]The way that I see it, the way that like some of my friends and we've like made videos together and it's like that's the way that I want to do it.
[97:12.41]It's a fucking lawyer stream.
[97:17.33]Exponential lawyers.
[97:18.31]Let's just see what this is like on expert.
[97:20.71]But hold on, somebody gave a lot of money, so let me go back and let me read some bits here.
[97:26.55]Lawyers are soundboards.
[97:31.64]But long story short, final point about this whole thing is obviously nothing is done yet.
[97:39.12]Don't worry.
[97:40.56]Because if I do end up signing a deal with Warner Brothers, I'm going to do the things that I want to do.
[97:49.83]And it's not going to be, like, I might be repeating myself a bunch of times, but I just want to make it really clear that this is a good thing.
[97:56.45]It won't be a bad thing.
[97:57.97]Because I, like, I'm going to make sure of that.
[98:00.29]And if not, if it doesn't work out, then I'm gone.
[98:02.91]I don't care.
[98:03.45]I'm not going to do it.
[98:04.35]You know, it's as simple as that.
[98:10.00]So, before we do this, I'm just going to say a very special, special, special thanks to Ben Elnor for the $100.
[98:19.32]Uh, that's 10,000 bits.

[100:59.04]I'm going to try.
[101:02.14]So, where's that well?
[101:05.50]Is there a well in every world?
[101:11.17]Or is it only in that first area?
[101:13.21]No, I can't look in that one.
[101:15.13]Come on!
[101:16.55]That's a well?
[101:17.21]That's like a fountain?
[101:17.95]Do I have to go all the way around?
[101:19.41]Do I have to go to world one for this?
[101:21.89]Or world two, whatever the hell it is?
[101:25.53]It should be one in every world.
[101:27.25]Come on, Microsoft.
[101:31.72]But all I can say about that whole meeting and, you know, talk was it's just kind of like, oh, that's cool.
[101:45.91]I guess I'm gonna maybe do that.
[101:49.17]And get some resources, you know?
[101:53.04]Through all your battles and all my rhymes, you have died, you have failed and perished 103 times.
[101:56.54]103. 103.
[102:04.09]Do the expert clown?
[102:05.23]Alright, we're going to do expert Peppy the Clown.
[102:07.71]103.
[102:11.14]Yeah.
[102:13.44]Yeah, guess what?
[102:17.08]Wait, hold on.
[102:17.92]Yeah, does that count retries?
[102:19.62]Wait, does that count retries?
[102:22.30]Wait a minute.
[102:24.67]I want to see.
[102:25.35]So it should be 104.
[102:26.01]Let's take a look.
[102:34.68]No, I've died 103 actual times, okay.
[102:37.24]That's Bepi the Clown, Bepi the Clown, 103.
[102:42.28]A brawl is surely brewing.
[102:45.82]A brawl is surely brewing.
[102:51.92]Oh, whoa, forgot about that shit.
[102:54.31]First real try, let's beat the fucking clown first try.
[102:59.55]So I'm gonna assume expert just adds like health or something.
[103:05.83]I think.
[103:12.87]No!
[103:13.57]I died!
[103:14.47]104.
[103:14.49]No, it was 103.
[103:17.19]103.
[103:17.23]Don't add, because I'm playing on Expert.
[103:23.05]Speeds up animations and adds health.
[103:25.51]Damn.
[103:26.71]Did I not find this person?
[103:29.47]No.
[103:30.69]Let's go back and just try to do, like, the first or second boss.
[103:33.19]Let's go do, like, the Frog Brothers on Expert, you know?
[103:37.77]Expert changes mechanics, too.
[103:38.91]That's cool.
[103:40.71]We gotta start small, guys.
[103:48.96]We have to go back to... We gotta start with our baby pants.
[103:55.52]Nobody ever did Expert World 3 right off the bat.
[103:59.18]We gotta do Expert World 1 first person.
[104:03.35]This is the cottage.
[104:05.91]Did I finish the game?
[104:06.51]Yes, I did.
[104:08.30]Uh, beat the devil.
[104:09.50]So who would we go with?
[104:10.46]Frog Brother.
[104:10.98]Okay, this is like the cornfield, right?
[104:15.16]This is like the first boss.
[104:19.22]Okay, it's much faster, that's for sure.
[104:22.37]Yeah, it's just quicker.
[104:28.47]A lot of things are faster.
[104:34.97]Yeah, like I said, going back, like, I don't remember what these guys did even before.
[104:38.01]It's been, like, too long.
[104:43.25]He, like, cries, right?
[104:52.66]Fuck.
[104:54.84]Got hit.
[104:55.74]Got hit!
[104:59.40]What do you do?
[104:59.78]You drop carrots from the sky, right?
[105:01.12]Something like that?
[105:01.76]Something weird?
[105:07.48]What?
[105:08.80]Oh, that's bullshit.
[105:11.38]Oh, that was horse shit, man.
[105:12.56]Come on.
[105:12.98]Like, that was it, too.
[105:13.74]Like, what the fuck was that?
[105:16.32]What did I get hit by?
[105:19.36]The fucking beam?
[105:24.88]105.
[105:24.92]Stop counting deaths.
[105:25.78]It doesn't count.
[105:26.84]It was 103, and I will remember that number for the rest of my life.
[105:34.17]To the radish.
[105:40.67]What the fuck?
[105:48.05]Oh, that sucks.
[105:56.76]What?
[105:59.18]Irritating.
[105:59.86]Irritating.
[106:10.96]Whoa!
[106:23.44]Fuck!
[106:27.88]I gotta... I gotta... Ah!
[106:29.40]The corn!
[106:30.30]You know what?
[106:31.47]The charge is not good for the corn.
[106:33.05]Because those... You gotta get rid of those stupid fucking... I'll get it.
[106:37.52]Why do I care?
[106:38.10]I already beat the game.
[106:39.58]Why do I care about this?
[106:40.62]I shouldn't be caring about this at all.
[106:41.96]I already beat this game.
[106:43.54]Why do I have to do this super ultra hard version?
[106:49.63]No, I'm not even... No, don't get angry at this.
[106:51.31]This is like the added bonus bullshit that I don't even need to care about.
[107:06.45]Alright, let's do it.
[107:07.99]I'm gonna do this right off the bat before anything happens here.
[107:18.45]There we go.
[107:21.27]Yeah, I'm trying to like do it too quick.
[107:29.90]That's better.
[107:32.18]Just trying to go too fast.
[107:35.71]This should be the end.
[107:37.67]Okay, expert mayans.
[107:43.42]Weapon change.
[107:44.06]What an expert.
[107:46.78]Oh, the loudness.
[107:48.12]The loudness.
[107:53.22]Next, next, next.
[108:00.74]Three expert deaths, one expert win.
[108:04.96]I want to see... Just for fun.
[108:10.77]Where's the... Where's the frogs?
[108:17.07]I wanted to see the frogs on the next part.
[108:23.65]So that does change.
[108:24.81]Alright, so they shoot out... Okay, I get it.
[108:27.15]They shoot out this shit too.
[108:35.58]That makes it a little more complicated.
[108:41.62]Pairing is another thing I really like dis... I really just did not pay that much attention to.
[108:45.49]At least during the... that's not true.
[108:48.19]I at least, like, did it, sort of.
[108:50.15]I wonder if that comes out the whole round, too.
[108:52.73]This is lasting much longer.
[109:05.59]What's the change here, guys?
[109:08.01]You do the windmill, right?
[109:08.91]I think it's just more of them.
[109:17.07]Ow!
[109:17.23]I can get this.
[109:17.77]I want to do this.
[109:20.93]I don't know if I like the charge, though.
[109:29.13]I have kind of a bad setup here.
[109:35.19]Yeah, I gotta... This is a terrible setup.
[109:39.06]107... No!
[109:40.62]It's so easy!
[109:43.54]Come on, man.
[109:44.22]Like, it's fucking expert.
[109:46.70]I gotta, like, re... I gotta get the whole fight in muscle memory again.
[109:49.62]Uh, actually, you know what?
[109:52.14]I feel like this would be better.
[109:54.64]And then, do chaser.
[109:56.86]For the dumb bugs.
[110:01.50]A great slam in that, son.
[110:03.92]It's on!
[110:09.63]At least for this part.
[110:12.03]Come on.
[110:12.53]Really?
[110:17.56]I'm just getting way too sloppy with that.
[110:19.76]Just aim up in the air and who cares?
[110:22.12]You'll end up hitting somebody.
[110:31.34]That's so stupid.
[110:36.76]That is pretty cheap, but you know, it is working the way that I wanted it to.
[110:46.16]And then we get the balls out for the next phase.
[110:53.32]Which will happen any minute now, right?
[110:57.97]Oh my god, I'm getting... This is what happens when you... You can't... You can't put on Chaser.
[111:01.85]Chaser is the worst weapon in the game.
[111:03.89]It just is.
[111:05.52]Because you get so... You just... You lose, like, oh, whatever.
[111:08.66]You get, like, a whatever attitude.
[111:10.24]It's not good.
[111:10.76]I'm gonna turn to the slot machine.
[111:19.11]Holy shit, are you kidding me?
[111:21.53]Oh, alright.
[111:22.01]It goes the other way now.
[111:29.19]Parry?
[111:29.91]I know I should be parrying, but...
[111:34.36]The chaser sucks.
[111:35.42]It really does.
[111:37.44]There's a couple specific places where I'd want to use it, but you have to be all over the place.
[111:41.48]Jumping around, dashing.
[111:43.66]Chaser doesn't really do... It puts you in a catatonic state.
[111:49.66]Parrying's gonna... Whatever.
[111:58.16]I just don't like the fact that... I wish there was an item that made it so when you parried, you didn't jump.
[112:02.08]You didn't bounce.
[112:05.13]You see what I'm talking about?
[112:05.82]Like, that's... I hate that.
[112:07.82]Because if you parry... Oh, parry that shit!
[112:09.98]It, like, knocks you in the air and puts you in a terrible fucking position for a lot of the mechanics.
[112:16.26]And I know that it's meant to be just kind of chained together, where, like, you do this, like, for instance, right?
[112:20.01]Like... Yeah, you do this!
[112:23.17]That's what you do!
[112:26.73]I have to beat the frogs on expert.
[112:27.93]You know what I mean?
[112:32.16]Like, I have to beat the frogs on expert.
[112:33.58]Just have to.
[112:38.20]You see what I'm talking about?
[112:40.28]You're supposed to chain it together.
[112:48.07]Sometimes it feels like I would rather not.
[112:49.59]Because it puts you too high in the air.
[112:53.01]You know what I'm saying?
[112:53.69]It's just that I don't like it.
[112:55.33]I'd rather just try to dodge.
[113:00.79]Into the air with you, with your fucking cereal.
[113:08.84]Cereal juice!
[113:10.81]Next, next sec- Oh, hey, hold on a second!
[113:15.23]Oh, guys, I've been looking forward to this game for, like, three years.
[113:17.81]I wanna, like, just play around a little bit.
[113:19.51]Jesus criminy!
[113:24.26]Like, this is only the second time I've, like, sat down to play the game, and you guys want me to leave it?
[113:28.52]I was waiting a fucking quarter of a decade for this!
[113:38.74]Here we go.
[113:39.22]This should be the end here.
[113:43.46]Alright, here we go.
[113:46.52]We'll do it.
[113:47.36]Just be aware.
[113:50.70]That was lucky.
[113:53.58]That was just lucky.
[113:57.42]That's all there is to it.
[114:02.67]Woo!
[114:03.25]I thought it was not going to hit me.
[114:04.17]I thought my hitbox was big enough.
[114:05.19]Apparently it wasn't.
[114:09.83]There we go.
[114:10.25]Here comes the slot machine.
[114:10.93]And I'm going to wait until it pops up.
[114:15.97]What do we got?
[114:22.19]And what is it?
[114:23.55]I don't remember what this one is.
[114:24.77]Who knows?
[114:25.23]Oh, it's okay.
[114:27.66]Not bad.
[114:34.08]Aye, aye, aye.
[114:43.10]I don't know why I did that.
[114:44.58]I don't know why I did that.
[114:51.76]Replaying the game on stream.
[114:53.22]I'm not replaying.
[114:53.84]I'm just wanting to look at stuff.
[114:56.41]You promised me you were going to remove the next emote.
[114:58.43]I am.
[114:59.05]I was.
[115:02.21]Jumped right into it.
[115:03.19]I just want to look around.
[115:03.91]I just want to see.
[115:04.57]I just want to see what all these things are.
[115:08.28]Fix the mic.
[115:10.16]Why does this keep happening?
[115:13.89]Why does my mic keep getting dropped in OPS?
[115:15.85]I'm not doing that shit.
[115:16.79]What the fuck is going on here?
[115:17.79]Alright, let's do this on expert.
[115:24.12]You people did this.
[115:26.96]RIP next.
[115:27.60]No, it's gone.
[115:28.26]It's gone.
[115:28.56]It's being abused.
[115:30.88]It's being abused.
[115:36.92]Oh, Jesus.
[115:37.56]Everything is so much faster.
[115:38.65]A brawl is surely brewing.
[115:42.66]So this is where the game turns into, like, an ultra, ultra challenge.
[115:49.81]I can imagine sitting there, like, just memorizing whole bosses.
[115:54.75]For, like, a week.
[115:55.63]This is a different... I never saw this.
[115:59.08]Holy shit.
[115:59.96]That's new?
[116:00.46]See what I'm talking about?
[116:03.72]Somebody said that they add mechanics.
[116:05.16]They weren't lying.
[116:11.29]They were not kidding.
[116:17.89]Really?
[116:19.11]Did I just do that shit?
[116:22.91]Give me the moon phase.
[116:26.29]I want to see the moon.
[116:26.99]I want to see the new and improved moon.
[116:30.23]Oh my god.
[116:31.92]I thought she was transitioning.
[116:33.18]I thought she was going to the next phase.
[116:35.08]I can do this one.
[116:36.58]That ain't new?
[116:37.10]I didn't see it before.
[116:45.67]It's cool because even if you've played this one before Just the fact that all the animations are like sped up Makes the muscle memory of the whole encounter completely different because you're just sitting there like wait I remember it was this quickly how much wait what what?
[117:03.79]Really So what does simple do Oh fucking god
[117:15.80]Does simple make it, like, slower?
[117:17.68]I didn't even try it.
[117:18.38]I didn't even look at it.
[117:19.62]There she goes.
[117:30.64]I just want to see what's... Gotta beat one of these bosses on Expert, you know what I mean?
[117:35.32]At least one.
[117:35.94]Just so I can say, yeah, I beat that guy on Expert.
[117:37.76]Wasn't even a big deal.
[117:42.38]Although, this is gonna take a while.
[117:47.14]Simple removes phases and makes the game easier.
[117:49.76]Ben just gave 100 bucks.
[117:54.72]Ben Elnor again.
[117:55.82]10,000 bits.
[117:58.86]$100 again.
[118:00.54]Jesus.
[118:02.92]Thank you so much, dude.
[118:04.54]That's a double hundo from you, right?
[118:08.59]Over the course of the last 30 minutes.
[118:10.99]That's $200 in 30 minutes.
[118:14.39]Holy shit, man.
[118:15.73]Thank you.
[118:16.89]No message, just says, cheer 10,000.
[118:19.85]Much appreciated.
[118:20.39]That's a lot of fucking money.
[118:24.91]Ben Elnor.
[118:26.99]Ladies and gentlemen.
[118:29.51]That's just Bill Gates.
[118:33.70]Ben Elnor.
[118:34.50]Yeah, that's the first and last name.
[118:36.10]Bill Gates Elnor.
[118:38.96]Anyways, yeah.
[118:41.94]That's very, very kind of you.
[118:44.66]I feel like I can do this, I do.
[118:48.86]$100 to watch someone die over and over.
[118:50.38]Well, I mean, at this point, yeah.
[118:54.98]Come on, what's my... Let's be real.
[118:57.68]Be real with me.
[118:58.28]I want you guys to be real.
[119:00.68]Talk to me, like, with reality here.
[119:02.62]With reality.
[119:04.66]I beat the game... I didn't play the game on, like, simple difficulty.
[119:08.21]I beat everybody on, like, just the normal fucking Cuphead difficulty.
[119:11.63]And I beat it in, like, five hours.
[119:13.82]Come on.
[119:14.16]Like, that's... Where does that put me?
[119:20.00]Huh?
[119:20.26]Does that... That's pretty good.
[119:24.46]That guy was blocked by a fucking tree.
[119:34.77]Heh heh.
[119:37.39]to C+.
[119:39.07]No, it ain't.
[119:40.63]That's like very clearly like an 85.
[119:42.01]It just is.
[119:44.29]Don't feed me this horse shit.
[119:50.61]Don't feed me that bullshit.
[119:58.77]Here comes the moon, right?
[120:04.43]In just a moment, it should be.
[120:08.09]I think.
[120:15.26]There she goes.
[120:19.10]I forget what she does here.
[120:20.04]She turns into the moon, right?
[120:22.32]And then, and then what happens?
[120:23.46]I forget.
[120:29.87]Oh yeah, this is the, I remember this part.
[120:35.74]Yeah, holy shit.
[120:37.16]You gotta be, like, perfect.
[120:39.26]Damn it.
[120:42.35]The UFOs, you gotta bait those out immediately.
[120:44.89]They go so fast.
[120:46.01]Alright, let's get there again.
[120:51.68]No, I can't take damage here.
[120:56.46]Just go find the clown.
[120:59.40]What do you mean, find the clown?
[121:07.86]And turn into this thing.
[121:13.54]The double sheep lady.
[121:21.62]Whoa!
[121:24.68]This is not a really good indicator when that thing's going to shoot or where it's going to shoot.
[121:34.91]Not really, at least.
[121:36.41]That I can tell.
[121:37.74]Oh, fuck you.
[121:39.90]What a bad spot you put me in, game.
[121:47.62]Give me Cupid.
[121:54.21]Fucking hell!
[121:55.89]Oh, that sucks!
[121:59.09]That's so fucking annoying.
[122:02.42]Turn again.
[122:02.96]Oh, that's annoying.
[122:04.34]This is one of the longer ones, too.
[122:05.44]I don't know why I didn't fight one of the shorter guys.
[122:07.33]Fucking hell.
[122:10.95]No, no, no, no, no.
[122:11.97]I mean, I could... No.
[122:17.43]So, where's the fourth clown that they're looking for, right?
[122:26.03]Where is this clown?
[122:31.04]Is he in, like, one of the other worlds?
[122:37.36]Make next ab- Yeah, we're gonna remove the emote and I'm gonna ban the word next.
[122:43.35]It was like a joke for two streams.
[122:45.45]And how people are just like, yeah, fuck this guy, next.
[122:50.77]It's me.
[122:56.97]Let's go to world two.
[123:07.02]Next is the best ebook.
[123:11.08]Do the other Dice King bosses?
[123:12.38]That's a good idea.
[123:13.06]I could do that.
[123:13.50]Alright, so you tell me this guy... Where is this dude?
[123:16.69]By the water?
[123:19.03]Where?
[123:25.39]Actually, I have a lot of people here.
[123:27.63]So let's do this.
[123:28.79]Because this is going to be tomorrow night.
[123:30.04]So I want to know what you guys want to do.
[123:33.60]Because tonight we're just like...
[123:35.15]getting the rest of Cuphead and then maybe something else.
[123:37.30]It depends.
[123:38.72]I've also been extremely, extremely tired.
[123:42.24]So, might just come back strong tomorrow after we go through all of, like, what I wanted to see in Cuphead.
[123:47.59]We'll see.
[123:49.23]So tomorrow, a bunch of PSVR shit has come out.
[123:52.99]A couple of horror games.
[123:53.95]It is October.
[123:54.71]Might as well start being a weirdo, right?
[123:57.11]So it's either PSVR like PlayStation 4, a bunch of random PSVR games, or PS3 like Trash Roulette.
[124:09.14]We could do that again.
[124:10.76]So that's for tomorrow night.
[124:13.46]I'll give you a poll.
[124:16.12]Uh, but tomorrow night, by the way, like, if you do pick PS3, we're doing Tony Hawk's Ride with the stupid shitty peripheral.
[124:22.52]With the skateboard peripheral.
[124:24.66]Like, the worst game ever made.
[124:26.30]So, that's what we'll probably start with.
[124:29.36]So, PSVR... PSVR Puke Night.
[124:33.95]Or... PS3 Garbage Night.
[124:36.99]Yeah, great.
[124:42.13]PSVR Puke Night, PS3 Shitfest.
[124:48.70]So, let's get you to pull.
[124:51.68]PS4 shit or PS3 shit?
[124:53.86]That's not true.
[124:54.53]PSVR is, like, kind of cool.
[124:55.93]There's a lot of, like, cool shit for PSVR.
[125:01.73]So, while we do this... Take a vote.
[125:06.83]I'm going to let that sit there for the remainder of how long we play.
[125:13.59]And let's go find this clown.
[125:18.94]I don't see him down here.
[125:22.90]And they're off.
[125:25.46]I'm Mr. Pinky bought Cuphead through my Cuphead by Cuphead link and says I hope I don't break my monitor.
[125:31.75]Thanks for buying Cuphead through my Cuphead referral program.
[125:37.03]Thank you.
[125:39.24]Behind the tent.
[125:46.56]Well, I'm like behind the world here.
[125:51.03]I don't know where I am.
[125:51.71]The fuck is... What?
[125:56.36]What was the point of that?
[126:00.86]Was this just a skip to be able to... Well, hey, speedrunners, take a look at this one.
[126:10.46]Take a look at that one, guys.
[126:16.66]If you're planning on running this game in under 22 minutes, you should check that out.
[126:23.87]Alright, where is this guy?
[126:26.78]They already know.
[126:27.62]I know.
[126:27.86]I'm just being facetious.
[126:33.00]In the tent.
[126:41.92]Found him!
[126:44.18]At last, I thought I'd never see another living soul again.
[126:46.44]I lost my way while searching for coins.
[126:49.22]No one has money for haircuts these days, thanks to that blasted casino.
[126:52.95]Well, I'd better get back to my pals in the quartet.
[126:57.91]Okay.
[126:59.90]Is this like a secret boss or something?
[127:04.44]Oh boy, you did it.
[127:05.14]We're a quartet once more.
[127:06.52]Gee, you must have run yourself ragged tracking him down.
[127:09.54]We can't thank you enough.
[127:10.30]Let's celebrate with a song.
[127:11.78]Ready, boys?
[127:13.10]Key of B-flat.
[127:16.39]Nice.
[127:36.02]I can't move on oh god damn it.
[127:44.37]I'm so sorry.
[127:46.57]We're trying to move do it again.
[127:50.26]Oh
[127:55.44]I just like cut them off.
[127:59.17]From the top.
[128:00.13]Go outside, why?
[128:16.49]It's alright, like, they're gonna do it again.
[128:17.77]We're fine.
[128:18.27]We gotta- Again is a joke.
[128:19.65]I'm not doing it- I wanna hear the whole thing!
[128:21.17]Come on, guys, like, what's with this patience?
[128:23.95]P-break?
[128:24.57]Nah, I'm good.
[128:38.45]It's a ten minute song.
[128:43.63]Hey, hey, easy, chat.
[128:51.84]Easy.
[128:53.84]Easy.
[128:54.16]Don't make me get the spray can.
[128:56.50]Don't make me get the fucking spray can.
[128:57.92]If everyone wants to talk to you... Stop it!
[129:02.86]Stop...
[129:15.57]nitrous oxide by webcam.
[129:21.61]That was nice.
[129:22.09]That was cool.
[129:24.22]Alright.
[129:26.08]Well.
[129:28.44]Your cat just, like, freaked out.
[129:33.74]103.
[129:33.86]Not 114.
[129:34.10]Alright, well, this has been fun.
[129:38.29]I do actually... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[129:40.68]Let's go.
[129:41.04]I want to see what simple does, just out of curiosity.
[129:44.00]Simple.
[129:44.66]What does it do?
[129:46.38]King dice bosses, we're going to go to you.
[129:47.86]Yes, that's true.
[129:48.44]I just want to see what simple does.
[129:51.13]Like, is it really simple?
[129:59.95]I mean, it's pretty simple.
[130:02.57]It's fairly simple.
[130:07.45]I guess this is cool if you have co-op with your little brother or something.
[130:12.77]And you're teaching somebody the game.
[130:14.03]I can understand how this would be fun.
[130:16.13]There's no bullshit here swinging at me.
[130:19.59]If you want to co-op with a friend, you just want to chill and see the mechanics.
[130:23.29]Okay, if I can hit one time, I have to do ten push-ups on this road.
[130:34.15]If I can hit once, I have to do ten push-ups on this road.
[130:43.80]I'm gonna psych myself up and fucking get hit.
[130:51.24]Why am I psyching myself up so much?
[130:53.36]I'm so psyched up right now.
[131:05.15]Well, I'm losing my mind here, guys.
[131:13.88]No, not 10 dabs.
[131:15.66]Fuck that.
[131:16.16]I need to use my thing here.
[131:31.04]That doesn't count as getting hit, guys, because I was trying to blow him up.
[131:43.22]I'm so paranoid.
[131:47.78]I'm gonna get my one straight bullet.
[131:49.42]Okay, don't have to do any push-ups.
[131:52.58]We're done.
[131:53.48]Don't have to do any... Missed your target, that was it, you tried.
[131:55.32]That's not a hit, that's not a hit.
[131:56.76]I still have three health.
[132:03.40]That wasn't a hit.
[132:04.20]No, it wasn't.
[132:05.00]Stop it!
[132:05.38]Did I just get a D plus?
[132:06.22]Hold on, how did I get a D plus on simple?
[132:10.24]That doesn't make any sense.
[132:11.28]I didn't do anything wrong.
[132:31.49]What's with my mic?
[132:32.42]Why does it keep doing that?
[132:35.86]That's so... That's the lowest grade I've gotten so far.
[132:43.38]That's the absolute lowest grade.
[132:45.30]I have not gotten lower than like a C. It's because I played on simple.
[132:56.11]I can understand that.
[132:56.91]Okay.
[132:57.89]Let's go see the other bosses that we didn't see.
[133:00.49]From Mr. Casino Man.
[133:06.99]I do want to see pretty much everything.
[133:09.29]Yeah, the audio is auto-adjusting, I don't understand why.
[133:13.98]So it must just be hard to get... It must be difficult to get... Like, S rank?
[133:23.86]You can probably only get that on Expert, I would assume?
[133:35.63]Gamer license removed.
[133:36.67]No, I got it back.
[133:38.61]Guys, I got my gamer license back when I beat Demon's Souls last week and Cuphead today.
[133:43.76]I got it back.
[133:45.28]And then some.
[133:48.10]S rank is all parries, six EX moves, and no hits.
[133:50.66]Holy shit.
[133:53.55]Damn, I can do that on expert?
[133:54.59]Is it going too loud?
[133:58.13]Yeah, it probably is now.
[133:59.01]I'll turn it down.
[134:01.05]Alright, so let's just go through them all.
[134:04.03]Let's just do one by one.
[134:08.72]Let's just see what they are.
[134:09.46]I'm just a regular streamer.
[134:13.10]Sorry, guys.
[134:13.90]I'm going to lose to this.
[134:15.02]I have a terrible setup here.
[134:20.44]No, no, no.
[134:21.94]Wait, wait, wait.
[134:22.96]I'm not doing this with tracking.
[134:26.07]I'm not doing it with tracking.
[134:30.29]I'm doing this with charge and spread.
[134:35.55]Nothing else.
[134:41.84]Yeah, I upped my gamer credit score.
[134:49.75]Let's go one by one.
[134:51.29]Why is the music so low?
[134:52.45]I just turned it down a little.
[134:53.35]Sorry about that.
[134:56.11]I have to beat these guys.
[135:01.76]Okay, who does what here?
[135:03.18]He spills.
[135:04.86]It's just the guy in the back.
[135:06.14]Alright, it's the guy in the back.
[135:07.89]I might be able to still do it.
[135:08.75]I want to see the guy in the back move.
[135:13.17]Well, there goes that one.
[135:22.70]She's down.
[135:23.30]Here he goes.
[135:27.60]Interesting.
[135:29.31]They all gotta die.
[135:30.03]Alright.
[135:30.49]So, I... It was just confusing at who was doing what animation.
[135:34.01]Now I have one HP.
[135:39.17]Let's go to two.
[135:41.35]Let's go through them all.
[135:42.51]Why not?
[135:43.33]Just to see it.
[135:43.85]At least I get my health back.
[135:49.23]And look, if I die, whatever, then we skip.
[135:55.02]Ooh, okay, this is chips.
[135:57.56]Okay, you have to hit him in the face.
[136:02.04]I believe you do.
[136:04.02]Oh, boy.
[136:04.58]Okay, we're separating.
[136:05.44]Yeah, right in the face.
[136:08.95]Cowboy chips.
[136:09.85]This is my favorite boss of the whole game.
[136:12.91]I love this guy Why couldn't this guy be a full boss?
[136:21.97]I already love his mechanics and shit like I love this guy And we're about to never see him ever again.
[136:35.19]The background is awesome.
[136:38.39]I love this, like, casino shit.
[136:42.12]Easy boss is your favorite boss.
[136:44.00]Whatever.
[136:45.70]Come on, give me a break.
[136:53.30]I think we already saw this one.
[136:56.12]Double zero?
[136:57.78]Yeah, this is the cigar sausage.
[137:05.70]Well, I got cocky there.
[137:08.88]I got cocky, but it's alright.
[137:09.86]As long as I don't lose this, I'll get it back immediately.
[137:23.79]I keep getting afraid of the guys that are flying through.
[137:25.75]I think I can get hit by them.
[137:31.26]Okay, he's dead.
[137:34.32]Cool.
[137:36.60]I'm doing it on regular?
[137:37.48]Oh, I know.
[137:37.90]I'm not going to do this on expert.
[137:38.84]I just want to see the other bosses.
[137:40.10]Maybe there's two or three spaces we haven't seen?
[137:43.61]Maybe?
[137:44.95]Safe doesn't matter, so we're going for a two.
[137:49.75]I might die here, but regardless if I die, we're going to go C4.
[137:52.29]Alright, this is... I didn't get hit on this one, but it's still kind of annoying.
[138:04.96]Um, okay.
[138:05.70]So, whatever.
[138:06.22]We'll just go back and do it again.
[138:09.36]That was number four.
[138:10.32]We're just gonna do two, and then, yeah.
[138:15.12]It's alright.
[138:15.60]We'll be fine.
[138:20.19]Wow, what a crazy level.
[138:21.59]Yeah.
[138:22.87]That actually was pretty crazy, you know, before.
[138:26.13]I didn't get how- I was just being cocky.
[138:27.63]Look, we're doing the chip guy.
[138:28.73]This guy's easy.
[138:33.94]I'm trying to see all the content.
[138:37.42]Fuck.
[138:41.60]Uh-huh.
[138:42.50]Yep, yep, yep.
[138:50.88]Fuck.
[138:51.60]I got too cocky.
[138:52.33]I'm getting too cocky.
[138:56.39]I'm getting way too overzealous just trying to get by this.
[139:01.81]It's alright.
[139:02.49]Just need to do three.
[139:03.47]One, two, three.
[139:04.41]That's what we are.
[139:04.91]That's what we ended up.
[139:06.61]One, two, three.
[139:11.43]This is what we are.
[139:12.13]This is some level one boss shit.
[139:14.87]Yeah, I mean, it's a boss rush.
[139:15.95]You know, that's what happens.
[139:19.17]I just gotta stop.
[139:24.20]Once he throws out that first... Yeah, this thing.
[139:25.94]Just gotta be careful about it.
[139:35.27]I don't know why I'm gonna try to parry that.
[139:41.37]Fuck.
[139:48.36]Should be it.
[139:49.26]One more, maybe.
[139:50.80]Two more.
[139:51.34]There it is.
[139:52.96]Okay.
[139:53.38]Keep going.
[139:53.84]Let's do it.
[139:54.24]See it all.
[139:54.66]See the whole thing.
[139:59.10]Did I beat the devil yet?
[139:59.88]I'm just going back to try to see the other bosses that we didn't see from the casino game.
[140:03.95]Because there are probably like two or three more.
[140:05.83]Let's go with one.
[140:06.91]Am I going to send me a pick of your boobs?
[140:13.77]What?
[140:17.27]Here's the magician.
[140:18.01]I'm just going to dash through this shit.
[140:25.32]No reason to even attempt to dodge.
[140:27.28]Why would we?
[140:28.44]Wow, I forgot about you.
[140:29.40]Forgot, forgot, forgot, forgot.
[140:30.40]My brain just completely forgot about it.
[140:37.46]Come on, man.
[140:38.10]What the fuck?
[140:39.24]That's stupid.
[140:41.00]They have to be, like, sitting there for you.
[140:42.40]Like, give me a break.
[140:43.28]Eat my fucking face.
[140:56.32]Show my boob- Like, what is this?
[140:59.60]What kind of, like, fourth grade humor are we talking about here?
[141:02.24]Like, show me your boobs?
[141:03.32]Come on, guys.
[141:04.14]What is this?
[141:05.68]Come on, guys.
[141:07.34]What is this?
[141:14.84]Presto Majesto.
[141:16.66]Charizard is amazing.
[141:18.15]Highly recommend.
[141:20.33]So we didn't beat this guy, though.
[141:22.51]We did not beat the horse.
[141:32.96]Can the present be destroyed?
[141:33.92]No.
[141:34.08]Just gotta watch out for the explosion it gives.
[141:36.70]I don't even know what hit me there.
[141:38.16]I have no idea.
[141:42.51]One of the people on the horse flew up in the air.
[141:50.31]What?
[141:50.61]What the?
[141:51.15]What?
[141:53.19]What?
[141:53.41]That's like the most annoying one.
[141:58.74]That just kind of comes out of nowhere.
[142:05.57]There's one guy that flies straight up in the air.
[142:17.33]We'll get there again.
[142:18.01]We're just going to skip everything else.
[142:27.20]Sausage.
[142:28.06]Yeah.
[142:30.68]We do have to see all the content, guys.
[142:32.82]It's important.
[142:38.66]Okay, I almost got hit on the sausage.
[142:40.14]That would have been embarrassing.
[142:47.42]If we got hit on this guy, you can revoke my gamer license.
[142:51.08]I'll just take it.
[142:51.80]I don't deserve it.
[142:52.76]So where did we end up?
[143:00.95]We need to do... We should do one... We'll do one and then one, two, three.
[143:05.65]Right?
[143:05.81]Because that's where I... I can't remember where the hell I was.
[143:11.12]Cause that'll bring us to the number 6, right?
[143:13.30]Where were we?
[143:16.76]Does it remember?
[143:17.22]Were we on 6 or were we on like 7?
[143:18.78]I think it was 6.
[143:27.85]Here's for the heart.
[143:33.49]Alright, let's not fuck this up.
[143:35.19]Let's go for the blue guys.
[143:44.50]Okay, yeah, it's like the guys with the phantoms.
[143:48.28]Do it.
[143:51.32]Fucking hell.
[143:54.24]You know what it is?
[143:54.76]It's the foreground that's... You know, this guy's the hardest guy of this whole thing because the foreground just completely fucks me up.
[144:01.67]That shit right there.
[144:02.91]That's annoying as all hell.
[144:15.59]He's dead.
[144:17.53]Jesus.
[144:19.13]Alright.
[144:19.51]He's got his money in his hands.
[144:20.40]Good.
[144:23.98]Alright.
[144:25.04]Let's get to seven.
[144:27.38]Almost there.
[144:27.82]I think we've seen everybody.
[144:34.82]If I'm correct here, I think we may have missed one person.
[144:41.97]Nope.
[144:42.33]Alright.
[144:42.61]This is new.
[144:43.05]Nope.
[144:44.80]We have... Alright.
[144:47.28]So you have to flip these around.
[144:50.62]I get it.
[144:54.31]So, it's actually not that bad, considering.
[144:56.17]Wow.
[144:59.55]Actually, it is kind of bad.
[145:00.45]What the fuck?
[145:03.79]Oh, okay.
[145:05.01]Well, there we go.
[145:07.52]Let's go again.
[145:15.42]Do it again!
[145:15.98]Ain't that bad.
[145:21.77]Well, it's not.
[145:22.43]I just need to know what she does.
[145:23.93]At least it wasn't that bad.
[145:28.61]Yeah, I don't even know why I'm... Why am I even playing her little game?
[145:32.98]I can just... I-frame through her.
[145:34.60]That's kind of... stupid.
[145:44.40]I want to get him before he goes to phase, like another pass.
[145:46.86]Fuck.
[145:48.65]He looks like he does it anyways.
[145:49.57]Come on, don't let him do it again.
[145:58.75]Come on!
[145:59.29]Aye, aye, aye.
[146:01.39]Really?
[146:01.65]There we go.
[146:09.08]Aesthetically, he's one of the cooler little mini-bosses there.
[146:14.66]I need to get back to seven.
[146:15.66]So let's do four.
[146:18.12]And then we'll do one, two, three.
[146:19.70]Okay.
[146:20.10]So let's do two.
[146:22.85]Just to get the extra health.
[146:24.89]And then we'll go one, two, three.
[146:31.02]It's a good day to die hard.
[146:33.44]Remember that movie?
[146:37.12]I saw that movie on Blu-ray.
[146:46.76]Cuphead.
[146:47.66]Or don't fuck with the devil.
[146:57.77]Easy does it.
[146:58.45]There we are.
[146:59.41]Okay.
[146:59.89]Back to where we were.
[147:00.53]Let's fight the weird chip lady.
[147:06.93]Aesthetic?
[147:08.32]What are you talking about?
[147:08.98]Aesthetic.
[147:10.72]That's what it is.
[147:11.20]That's how you pronounce that word, guys.
[147:16.89]It's aesthetic.
[147:20.88]What do you think it is?
[147:27.60]Aesthetic.
[147:30.80]It's aesthetic.
[147:33.72]So can we just... I don't know, maybe we can't.
[147:36.66]No, you can.
[147:38.54]Alright, I was gonna say, what the hell am I doing here?
[147:49.39]Well, you break this whole game's fucking mechanic when you decide that you have the invincibility frames on this boss.
[147:57.41]Kind of takes away from the whole idea they were going with here.
[148:03.01]Didn't even need to do the actual gameplay.
[148:07.95]You're putting too much emphasis on ass.
[148:12.01]Huh?
[148:13.43]Aesthetic.
[148:15.96]Aesthetic.
[148:16.94]Aesthetic.
[148:23.92]What is it?
[148:25.22]Aesthetic?
[148:28.92]Ooh, it's an 8-ball.
[148:31.58]This guy's creepy.
[148:35.24]Holy shit, I like this guy too.
[148:44.09]This is so cool.
[148:45.37]Some of these bosses should have been fleshed out and morphed as the actual bosses.
[148:49.49]Because they're so interesting looking.
[148:50.99]This guy reminds me of somebody from the Brave Little Toaster.
[148:54.82]Remember some of the creepy-ass shit that was in that guy's apartment?
[148:58.58]In the Brave Little Toaster?
[149:05.08]That was awesome.
[149:09.81]Well, we have one more boss to see before we... Alright, I've seen it all.
[149:16.53]And... what is it?
[149:17.87]Who are you?
[149:23.51]Oh, it's this thing.
[149:27.22]It's the thing I cheated on last time.
[149:35.82]Wait.
[149:37.06]Hold on.
[149:37.38]I didn't even fight this guy last time.
[149:40.26]I'm so confused.
[149:45.56]I just won last time.
[149:46.82]Alright, well.
[149:49.46]Cool.
[149:58.60]And there it is.
[149:59.44]You actually have to do the encounter.
[150:00.90]Yeah, I glitched him out last time.
[150:04.34]I mean, this is a really cool encounter.
[150:15.27]It's too bad I didn't get to see it.
[150:16.35]Alright, well, you're right here.
[150:28.47]Yeah, I guess you have to do them all.
[150:34.04]I would assume, right?
[150:39.20]Where the hell was it?
[150:42.56]You probably have to do it all.
[150:43.61]This guy probably, this guy turns out probably be the worst thing.
[150:46.85]You know, this guy probably actually is the worst one.
[150:49.57]In regards to length and time to beat and time to complete.
[150:51.77]No, it's right here.
[151:01.38]Ah, I thought I could get through it.
[151:05.08]Wow.
[151:11.66]Oh, shit!
[151:16.06]No!
[151:16.66]Ugh.
[151:30.29]I have to beat him now, right?
[151:31.33]I have to win.
[151:31.85]I have to beat that.
[151:34.52]Dude, and it smells like poison in my room.
[151:37.16]You know when you spray, like, this cleaner, like, the spray stuff?
[151:41.42]It just, hold on.
[151:42.18]It actually smells like poison in this room.
[151:44.20]You know that, like, poison smell?
[151:48.09]Hold on.
[151:48.49]It smells like cheese nips in here.
[151:59.38]Like, the air has that heavy, smelly, bad-for-your-body smell.
[152:08.77]Well, I have this guy down to his science, so it doesn't matter.
[152:10.87]This should- this will conclu- What?!
[152:23.28]Oh, I just, like, breathed in a bunch of the poison!
[152:25.14]Fuck!
[152:37.73]There it is.
[152:42.78]Please stay healthy.
[152:44.14]I'm just kidding.
[152:45.06]I'm fine.
[152:48.34]Let's do one, one, two, three.
[152:49.58]You know, it's funny to me that people that are just like trickling into the stream probably just think like, holy shit, dude, you are stuck on this guy.
[152:59.59]It's like, I'm not.
[153:02.19]I beat this guy very fairly quickly.
[153:04.07]We're just going back and seeing the extra content.
[153:10.60]Now it smells like Oreos.
[153:12.82]What happened in here?
[153:20.20]Oh, not this guy again.
[153:21.92]This guy's like kind of the bane of my existence.
[153:31.93]Stay back.
[153:40.99]Gotta watch the bottom.
[153:50.42]Oh, really?
[153:51.28]Bullshit.
[153:56.42]There it is.
[154:00.05]Do I smell toast?
[154:00.97]No.
[154:02.90]What's the thing that's a demon around?
[154:05.54]Rotten eggs?
[154:06.72]If you smell rotten eggs, it means there's a demon.
[154:09.16]Like, near you, right?
[154:11.06]Sulfur?
[154:11.58]Like that heavy sulfur smell?
[154:15.06]I don't sense that.
[154:18.79]Let's go three.
[154:24.91]Last boss that we've never seen that I'm gonna beat.
[154:26.83]And we beat all the bosses.
[154:27.77]Did it.
[154:30.30]A brawl is surely brewing.
[154:38.58]Let's do it.
[154:39.48]Boom.
[154:39.96]I should have been paying attention to where the other ones were.
[154:44.45]I was not paying attention to where they were.
[154:47.77]What a moron.
[154:49.53]Nope.
[155:00.25]Where is it?
[155:02.17]I'm so glad it glitched that first time.
[155:03.84]It's part of the reason probably why I beat that first thing.
[155:25.61]Damage doesn't even matter, I don't think.
[155:26.87]You just actually have to get all the cards.
[155:30.50]Easy enough.
[155:36.20]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[155:38.04]Fly around, do your little thing.
[155:42.39]And the last one.
[155:44.09]Knockout!
[155:46.31]No, you actually have to kill him.
[155:52.21]So what happens if you don't beat him right here?
[155:53.29]Okay, you do.
[155:57.53]So that's it.
[155:58.17]That's all the bosses.
[156:00.19]We've seen every boss.
[156:01.95]Very, very good game.
[156:04.11]Fantastic game.
[156:08.91]We've already seen this dude.
[156:09.93]He just did a little walk.
[156:14.92]Yep, yep, yep.
[156:15.74]We've seen you.
[156:16.86]Can I just, like, sloppily beat you, I wonder?
[156:19.76]Like, how sloppy can I beat this guy?
[156:27.06]I kind of wish they... I mean, yeah, I get it.
[156:29.90]This guy is the end of this very long encounter.
[156:32.60]But I wish it was a little more than just this.
[156:36.42]I'm like, just... Come on, I told you it was going to be... I'm just, like, dying.
[156:45.45]Who cares?
[156:46.87]Do the start over, boss?
[156:48.35]No.
[156:50.70]This game was so creative with its mechanics.
[156:52.18]It was.
[157:00.89]Wait, that's not what I said.
[157:01.84]I've already beat him.
[157:02.58]I was just fucking around.
[157:05.16]Alright.
[157:06.66]Well, you want my final letter grade for Cuphead?
[157:08.98]Probably like a 4 out of 10.
[157:11.90]Like, I'd say this is a 4 out of 10.
[157:19.17]Hit fucking dog ears.
[157:20.37]What would that be?
[157:27.73]No, it's a very good game.
[157:28.69]Highly recommend it.
[157:30.70]I could see how this game would be a lot of fun with a friend.
[157:32.40]Just dicking around, drinking a couple beers, like playing this with a buddy.
[157:36.88]Solo, it's a lot of fun.
[157:37.65]There's a lot of content.
[157:38.59]There's a lot of perfectionist content.
[157:41.39]If you want to beat every level and get the highest possible letter grade and do everything on expert, there's a lot of difficulty here.
[157:51.31]It's 28 out of 70.
[157:51.79]Oh, oh well.
[157:59.73]Yeah, it's not online co-op yet.
[158:01.95]They might be adding it at some point soon.
[158:03.66]But, whatever.
[158:04.36]Alright, let's take a look at that poll.
[158:10.48]So, just for the last... Just because, just to get it out there one more time.
[158:16.48]Try doing a run and gun without shooting.
[158:19.82]What the hell happens there?
[158:25.04]Just so we get the whole thing there situated.
[158:31.60]And I think that's going to conclude the stream tonight, guys.
[158:36.15]I've been really, really tired from coming back from Los Angeles and shit.
[158:41.83]Just about three hours.
[158:42.89]Pretty short stream.
[158:44.76]I know I haven't been around.
[158:46.58]But I'm trying to make deals and make things work.
[158:51.36]There's a lot of potential cool shit that's happening in the very near future.
[158:54.70]And it's weighing on me a little bit, you know.
[158:58.94]It's one of those scenarios where I'm excited.
[159:02.02]I'm nervous.
[159:03.44]I'm condensed.
[159:05.94]I'm happy.
[159:07.13]But like, you know, think about it like this, right?
[159:09.13]I would have to be moving.
[159:11.05]Although I didn't even mention that.
[159:12.33]I would be moving to Los Angeles.
[159:15.94]I have to move to LA.
[159:17.28]I have to be like at like the Warner Brothers studio.
[159:21.05]this does go through and like this opportunity happens so this it's a lot you know I I just barely moved like like what like three or four years ago like three years ago I can move again I'd have to be living there so it's not something I'm doing from my like house here in Massachusetts I would have to go and live in l.a so that that's a lie you know that I have to think about that like do I like is that
[159:49.82]Uprooting your entire existence.
[159:55.78]I don't live with my parents.
[159:56.84]What?
[159:58.26]No.
[160:00.08]I do not live with my parents.
[160:02.24]No more PAX East?
[160:03.18]What?
[160:04.42]Who told you that?
[160:07.16]I would rather go to PAX East than go to PAX Prime because that's my fucking home city.
[160:11.05]That's my hometown.
[160:16.05]I'm gonna reboot the Animaniacs.
[160:17.67]No.
[160:19.57]But is... it's not... The reason why I've been holding back from talking about this is because it was nothing was... it wasn't real.
[160:29.60]I talked about this like two months ago.
[160:31.82]And in my video that I made on the main channel from like last month.
[160:36.53]This is a lot of random things have to fall in line for this to work.
[160:43.91]Go IRL for an hour.
[160:49.49]Just moved across the country myself for a dream job.
[160:51.43]It's tough but fulfilling as fuck.
[160:53.21]Yeah.
[160:54.53]Donkey, like, that's the thing.
[160:57.23]I hope it's worth it.
[160:58.19]I want it to be worth it for you guys too.
[160:59.91]I want to be able to make cool shit.
[161:03.21]I have like a dozen ideas that I want to get off the ground.
[161:06.09]Some of them already are off the ground.
[161:08.49]But others kind of do require outside assistance.
[161:15.08]And obviously these opportunities present themselves and it might not be a bad idea.
[161:27.73]You're gonna decide what's best?
[161:29.73]Yeah.
[161:32.31]I never want to limit, like, myself either, though.
[161:34.64]I never want to, like, just do something because, oh, yeah, I guess it's, like, kind of a job that's kind of easy and shit.
[161:39.56]Like, I can just go there and do it.
[161:42.22]No, I'd rather just... You know how it is.
[161:44.52]I don't have to go off on, like, a tangent about it, but you guys know that whatever it is I do, I'm gonna try and give it, like, 100%.
[161:51.68]And if it's good, it's good.
[161:53.49]If not, you know, then I'll do better, you know?
[161:59.14]But we'll see how that turns out.
[162:00.16]I might have some news for you guys.
[162:01.38]I might have a fairly huge announcement if it all goes through here over the next week or so.
[162:08.38]Depends on how it goes.
[162:11.44]So if not, then just pretend I never said anything and we're just going to move on.
[162:14.96]We're going to keep going as normal.
[162:18.69]Also, this is very important.
[162:20.05]Before anybody goes anywhere, this is extremely important.
[162:22.63]I made sure to make very clear that this doesn't end.
[162:26.91]Whatever I'm doing, any projects or any opportunities, this doesn't go away.
[162:32.84]I'm not going to stop streaming, by the way.
[162:34.60]If you think that, oh, wow, he's going to go out to California.
[162:37.76]He's going to be gone.
[162:38.68]He's going to fucking say, fuck you guys.
[162:40.54]No.
[162:41.50]This doesn't stop.
[162:45.31]This is important to me.
[162:47.35]Like it is.
[162:48.15]So why would I stop doing this?
[162:49.98]I have a ton of fun when I stream.
[162:51.14]It's like a blast every time.
[162:52.88]Sure, sometimes I get a little upset and sometimes things don't go my way and technical problems and I turn into like, you know, a little whiner.
[162:58.50]But it happens.
[162:59.04]It's just the way it is.
[163:00.46]It's me.
[163:02.04]It's not going to go away.
[163:07.39]Anyways.
[163:07.79]Anyways.
[163:12.21]Sometimes.
[163:13.11]Maybe like 40% of the time.
[163:16.13]So tomorrow night... Thank you for watching, everybody.
[163:18.80]Thanks for sticking around for this kind of short stream, but I do want to get some more rest.
[163:22.08]We're going to go strong tomorrow night.
[163:24.34]PSVR is the winner.
[163:25.96]I'm going to get a bunch of PSVR games.
[163:27.42]There's like two or three horror games that came out.
[163:30.49]And we're going to be an asshole in PSVR tomorrow night.
[163:32.81]So get your drinks ready if you're above the age of 29.
[163:34.93]It's going to be like a PSVR drink puke stream.
[163:41.94]Have a good night guys before I go I'm gonna read some bits Let's throw that out there Not 29 that's I'm sorry But again like just another just another just quick point nothing I said tonight like about like the whole like I was out there like Warner Brothers and machinima and
[164:06.39]I don't, like, don't take that as set in stone.
[164:09.09]Shit could change.
[164:10.13]I just want to make sure I keep you guys aware of, like, what's happening.
[164:13.97]Because it's fucking extremely important, like, extreme life change is what would be happening.
[164:20.94]Then, obviously, you guys, this stream, everything's a big part of my life, so why wouldn't I tell you when I could, right?
[164:28.68]But yeah, don't be like, oh, there he goes.
[164:30.28]He's moving.
[164:30.94]Can't wait to see what he does with Warner Brothers.
[164:33.76]He's making a new Looney Tunes show.
[164:35.70]That's what he said.
[164:36.31]He said he was making Looney Tunes 2.
[164:37.85]The new batch.
[164:40.61]That's not what happened.
[164:43.23]Anyways, thanks for sticking around.
[164:44.97]If you're new to the stream, hi.
[164:46.67]Bye.
[164:48.05]I'll be live tomorrow with PSVR.
[164:50.23]JK Laser, thanks for the $1.
[164:51.57]Fuck you, Jerma.
[164:52.27]Be a sellout.
[164:52.86]No.
[164:54.34]What does that word even mean nowadays?
[164:55.64]It means like a million.
[164:56.48]I could go off on another fucking rant here.
[164:58.80]But what does that even mean nowadays?
[165:02.16]I have what my definition of that is.
[165:04.96]But I'm sure everybody has different versions of what it means.
[165:07.53]But I know, in my brain, in my heart, what that means.
[165:13.93]Thank you, though.
[165:15.29]CC131988, thank you for the five dollars.
[165:17.69]Dad, sleep tight.
[165:20.21]Thank you, CC.
[165:21.35]Thanks for sticking around.
[165:22.07]Wizardism, thanks for the dollar.
[165:23.63]Bruce Willis is going to die hard one more time in the new Die Hard prequel.
[165:28.79]It's real.
[165:30.23]What?
[165:32.51]I do... You know, is it weird that I've never seen, like, a Die Hard movie?
[165:38.25]I saw, like, eight minutes of the one that they remade.
[165:41.00]Like, the Die Hard one with, like... The new one.
[165:48.16]There's, like, six of those movies, right?
[165:52.84]I've never even seen Scarface.
[165:54.94]I haven't.
[165:56.62]I've never seen the Lord of the Rings movies.
[165:59.37]I just barely watched the first Star Wars.
[166:04.73]I've never seen one episode of Star Trek.
[166:08.40]I only owned one game for Super Nintendo.
[166:12.56]And I didn't own another system until the PS4.
[166:17.88]My PC was built to do work from home.
[166:20.68]I didn't play games on it until like 2013.
[166:23.27]I was on somebody else's computer.
[166:25.61]I was in the library when I was making the videos from like 2010.
[166:30.58]Um, yeah, I'm pretty much out of the loop.
[166:33.70]No, I've seen them all.
[166:34.68]I'm just kidding.
[166:37.56]I said yes to PS4.
[166:40.98]I love Lord of the Rings.
[166:42.52]I love the, you know, come on, everybody knows that.
[166:46.24]I'm starving.
[166:47.06]All we have is nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
[166:52.92]That's like one of my, come on, I know that meme.
[166:54.75]I've seen it before.
[167:00.03]They are not for eating.
[167:04.09]Everyone knows that meme.
[167:05.37]I've watched that movie like 45 times.
[167:07.36]Meme stream.
[167:14.36]The Bjorks?
[167:17.17]Why can't we have some meat?
[167:19.85]What about their legs?
[167:21.43]They don't need those.
[167:23.96]Back off, scum!
[167:25.66]Get out of here!
[167:27.02]What a great fucking film.
[167:28.20]What a fantastic three.
[167:29.82]And Treebeard, he comes out and he's like, Oh, I betrayed and I grabbed you and you orcs.
[167:33.78]Fucking unbelievable.
[167:34.64]Peter Jackson deserves to be molded into gold when he dies.
[167:42.91]Anyways, I don't even know how I got there.
[167:45.05]How have we got there?
[167:45.67]I'm not sure.
[167:48.97]But thank you, Wizardism.
[167:50.03]Oh, from Die Hard, whatever.
[167:51.74]That is true, though.
[167:52.24]I've never seen Die Hard, so that is the one true part.
[167:56.76]Anyways, thank you, Johnny Bock, for the bits.
[167:58.90]Johnny Bock, again.
[167:59.66]Jeremy, watch Rat Movie off-stream.
[168:01.32]I will.
[168:02.44]I'll watch it, like, on the toilet tonight.
[168:05.02]Thank you, though, Johnny.
[168:06.02]Next, PS, watch Rat Movie on... No, no nexting.
[168:08.48]Next, it's gone.
[168:09.23]We're gonna get rid of it.
[168:11.97]Uh, the White Cerberus.
[168:13.55]Thanks for the bits.
[168:14.23]Not sure if my bit messages went through, but I just wanted to say thank you for existing.
[168:17.39]Well, thank you for existing.
[168:19.55]Because without you, there's no me, and without me, I can't do this.
[168:22.87]And then, like, you watching me lets me be me.
[168:26.03]So let me be me and let me be.
[168:27.97]They try to shut me down on MTV, but it just feels so empty without me.
[168:33.04]Thanks, man.
[168:35.86]Depresio, thank you.
[168:39.24]Eating a bowl of mixed Cheez-Its and cheese nips in your honor.
[168:42.74]Here's a toast to beating Cuphead on stream.
[168:44.45]Well, thank you.
[168:46.63]Thank you for the dollars.
[168:49.54]Frap Sparkle, thanks for the bits.
[168:50.80]How was California?
[168:51.59]It was fun.
[168:52.11]It was nice.
[168:52.71]The weather was much better than it is over here.
[168:57.13]I think I'm caught up.
[168:59.03]Pretty sure.
[168:59.67]Thank you again to the... There was a couple people.
[169:01.67]Ben Eleanor.
[169:02.77]Ben Eleanor.
[169:04.48]Eleanor Roosevelt gave like 200 plus dollars.
[169:08.82]Primo Knight gave 100 bucks earlier too.
[169:10.52]There was a lot of people that gave money.
[169:13.60]Let's go down here from a couple hours ago.
[169:15.17]Thank you Turian for the 5 bucks.
[169:18.65]I used to live in a voodoo city where every little thing had its own... Is this a song?
[169:26.76]This is a song or something.
[169:28.58]Some kind of lyric.
[169:29.72]People send me lyrics and I just read them in a normal voice.
[169:32.64]I don't even know.
[169:34.02]But thank you, Turian, for the seven.
[169:35.86]Thank you, Turian7, for the five dollars.
[169:39.58]Let's not ignore the fact that I'm streaming from a poisoned room.
[169:41.86]I know.
[169:43.02]Even with the window open.
[169:46.64]Uh, White Cerberus, thank you for the $5 from earlier, much earlier.
[169:49.40]Hey Jeremy, I just made a Twitch account to finally sub to you, and it wouldn't let me add a message.
[169:53.11]Anyway, I want to thank you for spending so much time out of your life to entertain so many people.
[169:56.97]Thank you for putting a smile on so many people's faces.
[169:58.73]Your jokes and your community has made many people's days and saved lives, so thank you so much.
[170:05.11]Um, Cerberus, like, I saw, obviously, the message that you just sent not that long ago, but... I... That makes me happy!
[170:14.40]It does!
[170:17.56]And you know, I'm getting older now.
[170:18.92]And I don't know how much more, I don't know how much longer I'm gonna be able to do this for.
[170:22.55]You know what I mean?
[170:22.99]Like, I don't know.
[170:23.51]This is everything I've ever wanted to do.
[170:25.71]This shit with, like, Warner Brothers and, like, the stream and the videos, like, over the last, like, five years.
[170:29.29]Like, this is everything I've ever fucking wanted to do in my life.
[170:31.67]Ever.
[170:33.33]I wanted to be, like, an actor or, like, a comedian and shit when I was, like, fucking 12.
[170:38.19]It's a dream come true.
[170:40.14]And you guys allow it to happen.
[170:42.34]I was only on that plane to Los Angeles this past weekend because you guys allowed it to happen.
[170:46.64]You understand?
[170:47.82]Don't ever forget that.
[170:48.82]Don't ever fucking forget it.
[170:50.15]Don't you ever fucking forget for a second.
[170:52.97]That's the only reason why I'm on that plane.
[170:55.95]Ever.
[170:59.15]It's a cigar, not a sausage.
[171:00.39]No, it is not.
[171:04.66]But you know, you go through life and I'm like 30 plus, 32 now.
[171:10.07]You know, I don't know.
[171:11.09]32 is older.
[171:13.33]It's not old, but, you know, 32, what happens at 42?
[171:16.37]What happens at 52?
[171:16.93]I just want to keep going.
[171:19.33]I want to keep seeing what I can do.
[171:21.69]And I want to try to push as far as I can with the time that I have on this Earth, right?
[171:26.51]However long that may be.
[171:29.83]Just want to see what's possible.
[171:34.07]And you guys have allowed a lot of things to happen to me in my life.
[171:38.19]So why would I ever take it for granted?
[171:40.93]It's why like a lot of, you know, I talk about my list of demands I have when I like take on something like this.
[171:46.75]It's because I know exactly what I want to do.
[171:51.97]And it goes back to like you guys.
[171:54.03]What I know you guys would want me to do.
[171:56.61]I know what I want to do.
[171:57.41]You guys know what you would expect from me.
[172:00.39]Because it works both ways.
[172:03.11]It's not like you guys aren't like a means to an end.
[172:05.09]You guys are the means, you know.
[172:07.15]That's so excruciatingly fucking important.
[172:12.06]And people, you hear this shit all the time, like, and people will talk about this, like, oh, well, you know, my fans, it's all about the fans.
[172:17.01]I love the fans.
[172:19.39]But it's true.
[172:20.71]It's just fucking true.
[172:22.05]It's a true statement.
[172:25.77]I would be, like, peeing in a jar.
[172:28.47]Like, at some, like, working at some, like, food store or something like that.
[172:31.28]Like, no, hold on, back it up, back it up.
[172:33.16]I wouldn't be, like, peeing in food.
[172:35.44]I would be in the bathroom, peeing in a jar, capping the jar, and, like, cleaning my hands, washing my hands.
[172:39.71]Employees, all employees must wash their hands.
[172:41.91]Cap the jar, put it in my backpack, and then, like, wash my hands and come back out.
[172:44.83]You know what I mean?
[172:47.63]Like, I don't even, I don't know what the fuck I would be doing.
[172:51.15]This is gonna come out to be, like, pretty long-winded, but...
[172:54.52]I mean, I guess I have to say these things when I get, like, fucking opportunities to come to Los Angeles and, oh, yeah, yes, yes, we want you to come to L.A.
[173:02.95]and we've got some opportunities for you, big video projects and big stuff.
[173:07.43]We want you to come out here and do it.
[173:08.63]It's like, holy, it's just Jesus fucking Christ.
[173:10.41]What?
[173:12.02]When did this happen?
[173:14.20]It's a lot.
[173:15.80]And I'm ready.
[173:16.94]Like, I'm ready to fucking do it.
[173:18.92]And hopefully whatever I do, or whatever I can do, is gonna be good.
[173:22.22]And worth watching, because that's all I care about.
[173:24.14]I don't care about anything else.
[173:27.60]Do I regularly pee in a jar?
[173:28.88]No, not really.
[173:30.82]Anyways, I'll stop being a broken record.
[173:33.00]Thank you, everybody.
[173:36.84]No memes.
[173:39.32]Uh... Thank you, StixRenegade, for the $5.
[173:43.04]I forgot my message.
[173:45.66]The owl thing is a... I know what it is.
[173:49.97]I know what it is now.
[173:51.79]But thank you sticks for the ten bucks.
[173:54.75]And did I miss anybody else?
[173:58.73]I think I got everybody.
[174:03.14]But that's going to wrap it up.
[174:04.90]I'm going to get some rest.
[174:07.54]I'm in contact with a few people about this whole thing and I might know something within the next few days or the next day.
[174:17.24]It's happening.
[174:17.80]The cogs are turning.
[174:18.73]So whatever it ends up being, if it happens at all.
[174:21.45]Good night, everybody.
[174:22.09]I will catch you tomorrow for PlayStation VR.
[174:27.50]Weird stream.
[174:29.18]Drinking stream.
[174:31.32]Good night, everybody.
[174:32.28]See you soon.
[174:33.12]Take care.
[174:34.19]Much love.
[175:01.36]you
