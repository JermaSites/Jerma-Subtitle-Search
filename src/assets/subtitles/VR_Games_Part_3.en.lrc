[00:01.54]Hello.
[00:04.57]How's everybody doing?
[00:09.15]Welcome back.
[00:12.29]To Streamer of the Week.
[00:14.33]That's me.
[00:17.79]I won the, uh... I just wanna make sure.
[00:20.88]I won the 2016 Streamer of the Week award.
[00:24.90]I like to announce that every stream, just so people are aware.
[00:33.21]I played Minecraft for like a couple hours.
[00:37.57]And I built a cool snowman that looked just like Olaf.
[00:41.77]And it was an honor.
[00:46.70]But welcome to another VR stream.
[00:50.06]Hope you're well rested.
[00:53.12]I'll just put on my utility belt on my hands.
[00:58.37]And we'll get started.
[00:59.21]Give me one second.
[01:46.02]So I wanted to try and see if I could get more of the room here.
[01:49.70]Oh my god!
[01:56.53]Hold on.
[01:59.85]Cuz when I- that's a little bit more wide, right?
[02:04.36]Oh wait, you can like see that shit.
[02:05.58]I wanna get- let me move that.
[02:10.12]Like this.
[02:14.13]So you can see more of the room.
[02:15.65]I'll go like that.
[02:16.53]Why don't you turn this way?
[02:17.86]There we go.
[02:18.68]Okay.
[02:20.12]So now I got a lot of complaints, okay?
[02:23.34]Last stream.
[02:24.78]Where once I got to be about here, I wasn't in frame anymore.
[02:28.60]And then once I got to be about here, I also wasn't in frame anymore.
[02:31.70]And we've got full widescreen now.
[02:34.82]Don't you understand?
[02:35.48]People were complaining.
[02:38.91]I got emails.
[02:41.31]So there we go.
[02:41.83]See?
[02:43.47]Now, no matter where I am, you should be able to see me across your entire television set.
[02:50.30]Isn't that something?
[02:53.18]I also got a haircut.
[02:55.22]What do you think?
[02:55.84]Let me move my Twitch chat back here.
[03:04.89]Too short?
[03:05.55]Well, you can't even see it.
[03:07.41]That's the joke.
[03:09.05]Glad you laughed at it.
[03:11.41]But anyways, let me get started here.
[03:12.37]We're gonna play Gorn.
[03:13.27]This is the first game we're gonna play, is Gorn.
[03:17.00]And let's make sure that you can see this.
[03:20.20]Otherwise, I'm gonna be in big trouble.
[03:26.70]And... Hey, look at that.
[03:29.38]Alright, now this is gonna be hard to drink.
[03:33.23]Coffee.
[03:34.49]Wait, let me make sure, because sometimes I get here, but is that a good widescreen display?
[03:40.76]You know what I'm saying?
[03:42.84]I'm going to walk this way.
[03:43.98]It's going to happen.
[03:46.80]That's a good display, right?
[03:51.32]I'm just concerned if I stand here.
[03:54.41]I'll just be where I'm supposed to be, like right here.
[03:57.03]This is perfect, alright.
[04:01.27]Tilt the camera down.
[04:02.35]Yeah, but if I tilt the camera down, you'll get to see below the belt.
[04:10.02]And if I, like, this is, like, the only place it can be.
[04:12.43]Because if I stand here, then, like, look at this shit.
[04:15.53]Like, I'm cut off over there.
[04:17.15]It's got to be... Like, I think that's perfect.
[04:20.91]I have to go down so I can show feet.
[04:28.12]I don't think so.
[04:30.22]What if I do it a little bit?
[04:31.54]I don't want this real estate to be that much taken up.
[04:34.14]You know what I mean?
[04:34.64]We'll do it a little bit.
[04:37.73]Alright, I'm stalling long enough.
[04:38.93]Let me get my hands in here.
[04:42.15]Welcome to another edition of fucking Boomer Plays Virtual Games.
[04:51.97]Hot dogs, horseshoes, and hand grenades is what we're doing next.
[04:55.08]You don't think I got that queued up already?
[04:56.40]Alright, let's go.
[05:03.00]I'm going in.
[05:06.79]Hold on, no I'm not.
[05:08.93]Which one of these goes in?
[05:13.25]So Gorn, from my understanding, it's a game where you have a farm, and your grandfather dies, and then the farm is then given to you, and you can buy cabbage, there's parsley, you have to press buttons on wood to get wood to build stuff.
[05:31.58]It's something like that.
[05:32.28]That's what at least I think.
[05:36.60]There's a bunch of townspeople, I guess, that you can make friends with and you can, like, romance them.
[05:40.40]It's kind of an interesting experience, I guess.
[05:43.72]Alright, let me see.
[05:44.44]Can I see you guys?
[05:46.36]Hey!
[05:46.70]There you are!
[05:52.12]Move hand here.
[05:55.20]Press and hold to... Wait.
[05:56.60]Move hand here.
[05:57.86]Press and hold to grab world.
[06:03.65]Pull... Hold and pull world
[06:07.30]I hate this already.
[06:08.18]We're playing a different game.
[06:13.12]I don't like the rowboat mechanic already.
[06:28.09]Is this supposed to be going faster?
[06:35.87]I have to skee- I'm doing something wrong, right?
[06:40.67]What am I doing wrong here?
[06:49.48]Uh, that's not correct.
[06:55.80]What is going on?
[06:56.96]Oh, f- Hold on!
[07:00.50]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[07:04.68]I got like strapped in already.
[07:06.22]Fucking hand straps.
[07:15.10]I'm gonna make a VR room and I'm just gonna have it be just padded with rubber all over the place.
[07:21.81]That's not correct still.
[07:25.41]I'm gonna have like pillows on the ground and then you won't need a wrist strap.
[07:29.47]I will construct a $14,000 room to not have to wear these.
[07:42.94]Alright.
[07:43.72]Okay.
[07:44.90]How we doing, huh?
[07:48.39]Rich.
[07:49.29]He's rich.
[07:52.65]Alright.
[07:52.95]Well, there we go.
[07:53.51]I, like, get to swim.
[07:54.93]Alright.
[07:56.87]Grab the big Willy Wonka lever and pull it.
[08:03.66]Gorn.
[08:05.56]So this is a game where you...
[08:10.24]Do you even know fight?
[08:12.42]Make a fist and show you know fight.
[08:14.76]Make a fist.
[08:16.10]Salute me and fight.
[08:22.76]I'm trying to do the Julius Caesar thumbs down.
[08:27.68]So, fight?
[08:30.90]I just punch him in the face?
[08:40.19]Raise your hands.
[08:41.94]Victory is yours.
[08:43.52]Oh, I get gold coins.
[08:46.40]Alright, so that's how you do it.
[08:47.94]How do you move, though?
[08:48.82]Do I have to, like, pull the world to move still?
[08:54.74]Does the dreamer kill someone?
[08:56.14]I didn't kill anybody.
[08:56.78]Alright, here we go.
[08:57.88]Movement options.
[08:59.18]That's what I'm talking about.
[09:00.12]Get over there.
[09:04.63]Like an old man with a cane.
[09:06.49]What's it say?
[09:07.05]Movement options.
[09:09.75]I'm not sure.
[09:10.41]Does this one come with guacamole?
[09:13.33]What about this one?
[09:14.23]I don't want any.
[09:15.05]I don't want any extra beans in that.
[09:17.06]Like I'm an old fucking man.
[09:18.62]Like a mose.
[09:21.16]Alright, graphics options.
[09:25.26]Huh?
[09:30.34]Do I have to like take the secret cube?
[09:39.07]Oh, for the love of God.
[09:42.72]Blur.
[09:43.54]Nope.
[09:44.66]Persistent blood armor shatter.
[09:46.16]Smooth camera on monitor.
[09:47.78]What the fuck does that mean?
[09:53.82]Alright.
[09:57.03]Strict chaperone.
[09:59.03]Get out of here.
[10:01.43]Strict chaperone, my ass.
[10:03.59]Movement grab and pull.
[10:05.79]Rotation off comfort mode.
[10:07.21]What does that mean?
[10:11.72]Gameplay options.
[10:15.38]Enter the demo, difficulty normal, slow-mo on kill.
[10:18.52]I guess keep it default.
[10:20.31]That's fine.
[10:31.82]Tier one.
[10:33.76]Berserker.
[10:36.36]General.
[10:37.90]Okay, what about main?
[10:41.14]It's just the off game.
[10:42.04]Toggle hold.
[10:43.94]Movement hold and gesture is this one.
[10:47.80]Endless.
[10:48.20]Is that me?
[10:50.99]Alright, let's go to tier one.
[10:55.25]So hold is hold.
[10:57.03]Let's go to that one.
[10:58.61]Tier one.
[10:59.19]Berserker.
[11:01.23]Let's go.
[11:14.66]I'm doing something wrong.
[11:18.28]Please, please.
[11:19.00]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[11:19.68]Smooth, smooth.
[11:20.36]For the love of God.
[11:21.64]Smooth camera.
[11:22.48]For the love of God.
[11:28.79]Oh, no.
[11:29.11]I don't get it, Jenny.
[11:30.09]Is this why it looks like this?
[11:36.13]Because that kind of hurts my eyes.
[11:51.02]Movement graphics options.
[11:55.60]Smooth camera on monitor.
[12:01.30]Better?
[12:01.56]Is that better?
[12:14.03]Movement options.
[12:21.87]Is this like frame ratey or am I insane?
[12:27.20]Turn off pull world.
[12:30.52]Movement.
[12:31.62]Grip button.
[12:34.74]HMD oriented.
[12:36.26]Controller oriented.
[12:37.72]Pull.
[12:38.87]Grip button.
[12:42.21]It might be the frame rate.
[12:43.21]I don't know why it's like this.
[12:46.77]It is pretty laggy.
[12:48.47]Controller oriented.
[12:53.68]Yeah, it is like a little frame rating.
[13:00.65]So control or orient, what does that mean?
[13:04.79]Check the FPS.
[13:09.71]Maybe it's something to do with like this, hold on.
[13:11.87]What if I do this?
[13:12.55]Is that better?
[13:23.07]Not really.
[13:24.11]Don't ask me why.
[13:28.53]Try lowering the graphics.
[13:29.89]I don't think I can.
[13:30.69]Didn't have a... It wasn't a problem last time.
[13:36.50]With, like, graphic and frame rate problems.
[13:40.28]Maybe it's just the game maybe in the menu here?
[13:43.34]Make a middle finger with the controller.
[13:46.40]Oh, okay, I can move like this.
[13:48.06]I get it.
[13:48.72]With my thumb.
[13:51.14]Alright, that's cool.
[13:52.16]Let's just get in the game and see what happens.
[13:53.36]I wanna see if the graphics are just fucked up or something.
[13:56.80]This looks really kind of terrible.
[14:13.60]You think you have what it takes to survive?
[14:17.18]Alright, let's see.
[14:19.96]Club?
[14:21.10]Alright, grab club.
[14:23.58]Yeah, this is not right.
[14:29.07]Like, at all.
[14:29.67]Look at that.
[14:31.93]This is not supposed to look like this.
[14:33.47]Why does this look like this?
[14:39.22]This is awful.
[14:48.16]Try a different game.
[14:51.36]Yeah, this is like, that just doesn't look right.
[14:53.66]I gotta get out of here.
[14:58.92]Turn off the motion smoothing.
[15:09.01]Allocate more rim.
[15:14.15]This is unfortunate.
[15:14.93]This game's supposed to be really fucking good.
[15:21.09]So why, like everything over there looks normal, like up there, no it doesn't, the whole game looks fucked up.
[15:25.47]Look at like, it's like wiggling around and shit.
[15:27.93]No, goodbye.
[15:30.05]No, get me out of this.
[15:31.93]Let's go look at the ground.
[15:33.85]Like the whole game is like jellyfish wiggling around.
[15:36.40]That's not correct.
[15:40.58]Give me a sec.
[15:42.06]That doesn't make any sense.
[15:45.52]You think you have what it takes to survive?
[15:50.19]I don't think I can do anything like that.
[15:54.11]Let me let Helen shield your eyes.
[15:56.61]This doesn't make any fucking sense.
[15:58.15]Hold on.
[16:07.28]That's how the game is?
[16:10.44]Just restart SteamVR.
[16:12.34]Yeah, just restart it.
[16:13.66]That's weird.
[16:19.52]Did you turn up supersampling?
[16:20.76]I didn't do anything.
[16:27.32]Dev said on Steam discussion page the latest update brought frame rate issues.
[16:33.23]Really?
[16:34.83]Well, that's kind of unfortunate.
[16:45.34]Screen smoothing is off.
[16:46.46]I turned it off.
[16:47.86]I turned off screen smoothing.
[16:53.18]Well, for the purposes of just getting this going... Use an older version.
[17:01.76]How the hell am I gonna do that?
[17:04.16]How do I use an older version of the game?
[17:06.62]You can't, like, go... What, am I gonna... How do I get an older version of Gorn?
[17:17.10]Right-click properties, versions.
[17:23.33]I mean, I have betas.
[17:26.11]Man, Enable Steam Overlay is just unchecked.
[17:31.13]Nah.
[17:33.45]Nah, this is fucked up.
[17:38.07]Hello, everyone.
[17:38.85]We've received a number of reports about performance issues affecting some people since the update.
[17:44.29]While we have been unable to reproduce these issues of our own, we've investigated as much as we can and did another update now to address these problems.
[17:53.14]If you're having performance issues since this update, can you please try the current version and let us know if the issue has been resolved?
[17:59.88]This is literally from two days ago.
[18:06.07]I don't think it fixed it.
[18:09.93]Oh, it's literally.
[18:13.41]Well, um... We're gonna have to go back to this, I think.
[18:21.57]Unless, like, let's go betas, none.
[18:24.61]Nah, there are no betas here.
[18:27.48]I think they updated the game today.
[18:31.26]Well, that's unfortunate.
[18:32.30]Let's go play hot dogs, horseshoes, and hand grenades.
[18:34.48]I'll come back to Goron.
[18:37.26]Give me a sec while I open it up.
[18:45.49]Oh, fuck.
[18:45.95]Did I lose my... Did I seriously lose my OVR drop?
[18:50.76]What the hell?
[18:53.50]Oh, goddammit.
[18:54.88]That's a pain in the ass.
[18:56.74]I was ready to go, too!
[18:58.08]Come on!
[19:06.85]What a bunch of bullshit.
[19:11.85]Hold on...
[19:17.90]You gotta be kidding me.
[19:18.60]I have to, like, set this back up again?
[19:19.80]This is what we call a pain in the ass, guys.
[19:24.13]Just gonna put this up for a minute.
[19:31.17]Fucking Gorn.
[19:39.42]How come I can't do this now?
[19:40.24]Now that the controllers aren't turned on.
[19:47.14]That would help.
[19:54.29]Hold on.
[19:55.13]Sorry, this is happening.
[19:58.07]Yep.
[20:01.47]Oh my god, why are you doing this?
[20:03.89]Why?
[20:04.49]I was ready to play!
[20:05.79]This motherfucker!
[20:10.99]And now, like, I have... Oh my god, I'm so pissed off right now.
[20:18.31]I was ready to play.
[20:19.33]It's done.
[20:20.57]We were good to go.
[20:27.60]Oh, how am I going to get this now?
[20:36.71]Oh, that's way too big.
[20:43.81]And 0.03.
[20:44.07]I had to save, too.
[20:46.53]Why?
[20:47.67]Fuck.
[20:51.00]Why is this so huge?
[20:54.22]This is, like, gigantic.
[20:56.30]Alright, there we go.
[21:15.68]Okay.
[21:17.50]Let's open up Hot Dogs, Heroes, and Hand Grenades.
[21:19.46]I don't know what the game is.
[21:34.87]Here it comes.
[21:36.33]Why should there be an update like two days ago that breaks this game too?
[21:44.57]We did an update and now some people just can't play it.
[21:48.11]Who fucking knows what the problem is.
[21:56.56]Hot dogs.
[22:01.86]Hot dogs, horseshoes, and hand grenades.
[22:13.78]That's unfortunate.
[22:14.24]It looked like a really fun game.
[22:16.49]I would have loved to have played it.
[22:18.19]We'll try it again another time.
[22:33.68]Hey!
[22:35.16]Hey, remember me?
[22:38.80]Mountain Blade VR.
[22:41.84]See, this is, yeah, this is... This looks pretty normal.
[22:46.77]Hands in the right place, probably.
[22:47.91]Alright, let's get back in.
[22:49.17]Let's go.
[22:51.97]Early access update 69.
[22:53.59]Nice.
[22:54.15]Watch the latest dev log.
[23:00.41]I have no idea what this game is.
[23:02.77]I've been told it's like a simulation sandbox.
[23:07.02]Guns and knives and pointy things and...
[23:11.90]Alright, quick tips.
[23:13.93]Read these first.
[23:14.93]Sure will.
[23:17.03]To open the main menu, turn... I can see you guys, right?
[23:19.35]Yeah, good.
[23:25.17]Select poop?
[23:26.07]What?
[23:26.23]Alright.
[23:28.44]To open the main menu, turn one controller towards you and point at it with the other hand.
[23:32.40]Uh-oh.
[23:34.44]Oh, okay, that's good.
[23:36.88]Spawn options?
[23:39.22]Arm swing, clean up scene, reload scene.
[23:42.83]Okay.
[23:44.17]Pull the trigger on the pointing hand to select an option.
[23:47.75]To move to a new place, press the menu button, the top most button on the Vive, so this one here.
[23:55.95]And hold, when you release you will teleport.
[24:00.15]Cool.
[24:03.07]Press trigger to pick up objects.
[24:05.37]For simple objects, release trigger to drop them.
[24:08.66]For complex objects, press the grip button.
[24:12.44]Touch, press, and hold grip buttons to hold all objects.
[24:15.89]So either grip and hold, or complex, I get it.
[24:19.97]To view controls for various firearms, select them in the item spawner found in most scenes.
[24:24.89]That's an item spawner.
[24:25.87]A control infographic will appear.
[24:28.67]Cool.
[24:31.71]Movement mode, input and control options, performance and quality.
[24:36.13]That just scared the shit out of me.
[24:39.15]I don't know why.
[24:39.71]I just saw it and I was like, something's coming to kill me.
[24:43.23]This is fine.
[24:44.75]This is good, right?
[24:50.59]I think, let's just play it.
[24:53.43]Simulation, let's just do it.
[24:54.73]Watch the latest devlog.
[24:56.39]Let's just go.

[61:49.31]Cleanup scene.
[61:52.17]Reload scene.
[61:57.09]Nah, we don't need to do that shit.
[61:58.09]Alright, I'm ready to try out one of these weird ones.
[62:07.83]But first, let me, like, do this, because this is what everybody, everyone wants me to do, like, the laugh out loud thing, right?
[62:18.36]Alright, meat grinder.
[62:22.80]Back to the sniper range.
[62:24.22]No, meat grinder.
[62:26.15]This is a survival horror game.
[62:27.61]Brave the Meat Grinder, a survival horror experience with procedural generally challenges and equipment.
[62:31.39]Can you find the meat within the maze and grind it before your 30 minutes runs out?
[62:38.36]What?
[62:41.62]Morning.
[62:42.04]Meat Grinder is an intense experience, a wholesale sensory barrage.
[62:46.56]You should not play.
[62:48.78]If you have epilepsy or are sensitive to strobing lights, you are prone to dizziness and have balance issues, you are claustrophobic, terrified of the dark, have a fear of being ground into meaty chunks, burnt alive.
[62:59.82]Meat grinder is a difficult, timed experience.
[63:01.74]You expect to die a lot.
[63:02.72]It assumes you know how to play.
[63:07.30]Okay.
[63:08.64]You know, when you go to a haunted house, and they have the room before the haunted house begins, and just barely after, where you can fucking exit
[63:19.09]Because it's too scary for your 14-year-old nephew?
[63:23.66]I think I'm about to do it.
[63:25.40]Come this way.
[63:26.92]I'm going to start crying.
[63:28.18]I'll start crying now.
[63:30.20]Like, come on.
[63:31.72]Can I go?
[63:32.42]It's so scary.
[63:33.70]And you're like, holy fuck, man.
[63:34.98]This kid is going to shit his pants.
[63:37.13]I'm going to traumatize this kid for life.
[63:39.15]No, no, no.
[63:39.37]Let's go play skee-ball.
[63:41.41]That's what's going to happen right now.
[63:42.37]I'm not doing this.
[63:49.95]We'll come back to that.
[63:52.79]Let's go to Arizona Range.
[63:55.77]That sounds nice and my speed, I think.
[64:00.07]Hey, that's a big one.

[64:31.73]And then no, I just got them both just to make sure you understand.
[64:42.63]Snap that up.
[64:52.85]Am I out of bullets?
[64:53.43]Alright, I'm out of bullets with that gun.
[64:57.59]Horseshoes?
[64:57.93]Oh, I can play horseshoes!

[68:28.34]Okay.
[68:32.37]Now that that's loaded, do you have to do anything else?
[68:37.01]Is shooting a rocket launcher this easy?
[68:38.71]You just have to put a rocket in the back and then press the button?

[73:19.18]So are there actual zombies in this game?
[73:24.58]I'm a little concerned right now.
[73:31.44]That's a meat grinder.
[73:33.14]This thing on?
[73:35.06]Meat.
[73:36.24]Cave Georgia.
[73:37.06]Don't step in that floor.
[73:41.00]try not to start bunny hopping around like an idiot just yet we're coming down from that uh well anyway I poisoned you in the future if you have a picture you might consider not eating unattended fast food that has been left in public
[73:57.89]Now that you're here, though, we have a number of things to accomplish before that dose of poison becomes fatal, which should be 29 minutes from now.
[74:08.58]And yes, those 29 minutes will be rough.
[74:12.16]Can't be helped, though.
[74:13.12]We've got work to do.
[74:14.92]So please drag yourself over to that table in front of you, and we'll begin.
[74:21.95]I'm here.
[74:23.19]Alright.
[74:23.97]Let's see here.
[74:24.87]I made myself notes for this part.
[74:26.39]Sure.
[74:28.41]Don't use any weapons.
[74:30.13]Introduce the machine.
[74:33.43]Tell the meat subject that they must venture into the meat grinder to find three meat objects and bring each of them here to feed into the aforementioned machine.
[74:42.34]Inform meat subject that they have been graciously given some starting tools, that this is a very sensitive and complicated testing environment.
[74:48.62]Blah blah blah.
[74:51.37]Yes, and there are more tools and other objects to be found in this wonderful device.
[74:58.01]Added one last time.
[74:59.63]And then I'm supposed to reiterate the amount of time the meat subject has left, which is less than 29 minutes, I'm afraid.
[75:06.68]So again, moving meat.
[75:07.30]Okay, there's a knife.
[75:16.22]And take a lighter, too, just in case I need it, right?
[75:23.11]Alright, I'm decked up.
[75:25.37]I'm ready.
[75:27.77]Where's my flashlight?
[75:31.28]What happened to the flashlight?

[79:04.04]Okay.
[79:05.10]Okay, careful.
[79:06.84]Be delicate with that.

[79:15.12]Is that good?
[79:32.01]Is that good?
[79:40.15]How do I put a bullet in here?
[79:43.31]That's just storage.
[79:44.45]I don't know how to load this fucking thing.
[79:50.91]Behind you.
[80:27.50]Is there bullets in here?
[80:29.28]Check it out.

[80:58.57]I thought it was a monster!
[80:59.83]Alright, I'm done.
[81:01.95]I'm not very good at this.
[81:08.12]I don't even know how to load all the guns.
[81:09.42]I don't even know how to load pistols, that's it.

[82:40.54]For the back?
[82:42.25]Iron sights?
[82:43.63]Don't roll off.
[83:02.68]It's for the other gun?
[83:32.30]But seriously, I knew all of them pretty well.
[83:41.36]I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for, but... Maybe I'll find it.
[84:00.73]Clear.

[86:27.25]Is it cocked?
[86:32.57]Are there any bolts in this?

[93:31.22]Okay, so get this shit out of here.
[93:35.39]I want just the regular default shotgun.
[93:39.50]Do I get that somewhere, or do I have only one slot?
[93:42.15]I only have one slot, huh?
[94:03.72]Okay, so now I got... Let's take another one.
[94:06.91]I'm just going to bring this shit with me.
[94:08.07]Because that spawned off now.
[94:12.61]Let's go shoot something.
[94:17.79]Like, just this guy.
[94:24.50]Okay, well, I'm sorry.
[94:26.42]I had to demonstrate.
[94:28.38]Here, you just sit in here.
[94:29.26]Okay.
[94:34.07]So now the question is, how do I open this?
[94:36.25]It was telling me how before.
[94:37.79]Probably should have looked at that tutorial that was there.
[94:46.37]Left, right.
[94:49.49]Up.
[94:50.76]It's this slot right here.
[94:51.90]Let's learn.
[94:57.98]We've got to learn.
[95:02.46]Oh, yeah.
[95:03.24]Dominant hand.
[95:07.09]Grab the floor grip.
[95:13.22]C. No, that's not C. Enable lever rotation.
[95:19.04]Wait.
[95:20.73]Is it the wrong gun?
[95:26.19]It was C.
[95:44.26]A, B, where's C?
[95:55.42]Wrong gun.
[95:56.82]But where is C?
[95:57.34]C is right there, but it's not listed here anyway.
[96:00.38]This is not labeled.
[96:01.32]Enable lever rotation.
[96:30.93]Move head in a circle.
[96:32.61]Pull to fire gun, right?
[96:39.57]With non-dominant hand on foregrip, pull and hold to enable lever rotation.
[96:47.40]Okay.
[96:49.10]So then that pops out.
[96:51.38]Then I... Hold on, not yet.
[96:54.26]I just had it.
[97:02.16]I literally just did it.
[97:03.26]Oh my god.
[97:25.27]How did I just did it?
[97:26.31]How the fuck did I do that?
[97:34.57]I have to grab the gun with two hands.
[97:46.90]Okay, so then, now, I put in a bullet.
[97:52.18]Jesus fucking god.
[98:01.09]How many?
[98:01.73]Only two can go in there, right?
[98:03.32]Can I do more than that?
[98:04.16]No, that's it.
[98:11.17]Okay.

[120:44.48]P90.
[120:44.72]Yeah.
[120:46.64]You kidding me?
[120:53.92]The P90's such a weird gun because it looks like a cartoon gun.
[120:56.76]This looks like it belongs in Halo, but it's a real gun.
[121:21.67]Got it.
[121:32.82]OK.
[121:34.30]Looks good.
[121:35.08]Is it ready?

[122:41.35]Can I like unscrew it and like, it's gonna blow up.
[122:45.04]No it's not, I'm fine.
[122:48.32]What have we got, what have we got?
[122:50.96]Let's clear all sausages.
[122:54.76]Might spawn a few more.
[123:01.50]This is bad for my computer.
[123:02.70]I'm not doing that anymore.
[123:07.72]Now let's blow them all up.
[123:11.28]How about, uh... Support.
[123:14.52]Uh, we got... Stinger.
[123:21.31]RPG.
[123:21.99]Let's go with Stinger.
[123:24.69]That's cool.
[123:26.67]Uh, battery.
[123:27.87]Stinger battery.
[123:29.97]So now let's play a game called How the Fuck Do You Load This?
[123:37.22]Well, that was easy.
[123:37.88]Do I have to turn this or move this?
[123:42.28]How does this work?
[123:43.00]What is this for up here?
[123:46.24]Why is there a grocery store basket up here?
[123:49.58]Anyone know what that is?
[123:54.93]That's the guidance system?
[123:57.75]How is this the kind of guidance system?
[124:04.34]Now we developed an anti-tank guidance system.
[124:07.30]It's the same thing you put fucking apples in.
[124:09.85]For some reason it works.
[124:15.23]Uh oh.
[124:26.16]How do you fire it?
[124:36.72]Pull a button?
[124:37.98]Pull a lever?
[124:38.58]How does this work?
[124:51.25]Load a missile.
[124:52.03]I didn't just do that.
[124:53.17]That is a missile, isn't it?
[124:59.16]I was making the battery joke and it is a battery.
[125:02.30]That's an actual battery.
[125:05.58]I didn't know that.
[125:11.51]These things take batteries?
[125:16.15]I thought that was an elaborate stupid fucking reference.
[125:26.06]No, keep the battery in there.
[125:35.34]There's something already in there.
[125:36.20]There's like a magic eight ball in there.
[125:39.78]Will I be a millionaire?
[125:43.34]Definitely no.
[125:45.32]We'll see, motherfucker.
[125:53.40]Where's my other rocket for this?
[125:59.44]How come the rocket's not there?
[126:01.78]Only the batteries.
[126:04.80]Strum grenade.
[126:05.78]4322 rocket.
[126:08.58]You're getting ammo elsewhere.
[126:18.99]The ammo menu.
[126:21.79]What the heck?
[126:26.03]Put this down.
[126:31.43]Miscellaneous?
[126:33.53]Horseshoe target utility firework.
[126:40.59]Wow.
[126:41.35]Really?
[126:44.07]Wow.
[126:44.93]Okay.
[126:47.17]I don't care about that.
[126:52.83]How do I open the lighter?
[126:56.59]Down on the D-pad.
[126:58.31]Rip.
[126:58.95]Flip it up.
[126:59.51]How do I flip this?
[127:01.10]Give me the matches.
[127:18.35]Don't do this, don't do this with your friends, okay?
[127:21.49]It's bad.
[127:22.90]What?
[127:23.26]The Roman candles don't do this.
[127:25.24]I have a battery.
[127:31.58]Where's the pocket?
[127:50.68]Is it this menu here?
[127:53.93]Slide, dash, TP.
[127:57.41]I have 17, 18 hours in this game?
[128:06.10]What?
[128:07.42]How long have I been streaming for?
[128:10.71]Holy shit, imagine.
[128:11.89]What the fuck does that mean?
[128:20.44]I've been trapped in VR.
[128:23.72]So I can't use this in here?

[128:49.35]Can you actually?
[128:50.21]That's the... I killed that guy.
[128:55.69]I knocked that guy unconscious by throwing one of these little bangs at him.
[128:58.49]You dump them all.
[129:02.70]Do the thing where you dump them all.
[129:04.52]Wow, this is not realistic.
[129:09.32]No, what the hell?
[129:10.00]Nobody does it like this.
[129:11.60]Everybody in their right mind.
[129:14.43]took the whole package bunched them up into a ball as tight as they could and whipped them into the ground as hard as they could nobody did singles no you like tied them all together at the tops and then whipped them into a brick wall into the ground what a waste what do you mean what a waste
[129:49.90]That's really cool that it's in the game, though.
[129:52.38]But wait a minute, I got a fucking crazy brilliant idea.
[129:55.86]Probably never seen a streamer do this before.

[151:33.45]Uh, there's a supply room over here somewhere.
[151:39.92]Down here?
[151:47.93]Supply room.
[151:51.41]Straight through there.
[151:52.09]And here.
[151:58.29]Huh.
[152:07.82]Down maybe?
[152:11.28]This looks pretty supply room to me.

[152:37.36]What do I got for health?
[152:41.98]72.
[152:42.04]How much does this heal?
[152:46.87]I feel like I should be eating these.
[152:47.87]Alright, what do we got?
[152:52.69]Ooh, it's a handgun.
[153:00.08]I have too many items.
[153:04.57]The health of full heal.
[153:07.53]Imagine.
[153:15.60]I'm going to put that here.
[153:34.19]Uh, this is pretty good.
[153:39.81]Yeah, I'm gonna use this shit.
[153:40.81]I don't even want the machine guns now.
[153:42.74]Alright, let's go.
[153:44.42]Through here, this should be a taking hold again.
[154:02.36]It's straight.
[154:03.90]Looks like it.
[154:09.51]Yep, right here.
[154:38.63]Wait, I hear somebody.
[154:40.35]Who's talking?
[154:42.30]Okay.
[154:52.34]Where the hell is it?
[154:55.01]Is it up there?
[154:58.13]It's like in the next room over here.
[155:08.61]Looks like it, but it's not.
[155:12.21]What about up there?
[155:18.41]There it is, okay, here we go.
[155:20.85]That's odd.
[155:37.62]Shit, I didn't even see that guy.
[156:10.66]Five?
[156:11.45]Aim?
[156:12.05]Nice aim!
[156:13.77]What?
[156:15.04]It's so hard to do!
[157:05.87]Sometimes you do kind of good.
[157:39.07]I was doing so well!
[157:40.80]That was really cool!
[157:42.20]I was doing a really good job!
[157:48.38]Oh fuck!
[157:52.90]Give me my gun back!
[158:07.50]Where's my handgun?
[158:10.36]This guy did so well too.
[158:35.04]I was like 8 out of 10 headshots and then dropped the gun.
[158:42.32]Story of my fucking life.
[158:45.04]Story of my goddamn life.
[158:47.00]Look at how perfect I'm doing.
[158:48.21]This is so impressive.
[158:49.99]Oh, I idiot.
[158:52.91]Goddamn.
[158:53.87]Alright.
[158:58.15]Let's take a look.
[158:59.23]So there's a supply drop over here somewhere.
[159:02.27]What am I doing on health?
[159:04.95]I need to go that way.
[159:13.44]Alright, I gotta go back.
[159:23.32]And through here?
[159:28.64]Straight this way.
[159:31.35]Straight out this way.
[159:52.16]He's a tech beaker I would say.
[159:55.22]It's called wait till guy gets close enough to you and then shoot yourself in the head.
[160:01.66]Oops, I'm stepping on cords.
[160:03.02]That's odd.
[160:12.48]Nice.
[160:15.64]I'm sure someone's around here.
[160:18.38]What was that?
[160:19.32]I just realized.
[160:20.10]I don't have hands.
[160:22.42]What was that?
[160:34.74]Alright, what am I replacing?
[160:39.16]Consume your hot dog.
[160:40.19]No, I don't need it yet.
[160:41.39]Alright, I need to... I gotta get rid of the little one here.
[160:50.47]This one here.
[160:52.89]Yeah.
[160:53.57]Sure is awfully lonely out here.
[160:58.77]Did you hear that?
[161:01.31]This is cool.
[161:01.99]Look at this thing.
[161:03.54]Wow.
[161:04.80]No, no, no, no, no.
[161:05.98]Take that off.
[161:07.26]I don't have hands.
[161:12.16]Okay, take this off.
[161:18.28]I'm sure Stu will hear that.
[161:21.30]And then this flips up.
[161:24.42]And then that pulls back.
[161:27.52]I think we're done.
[161:28.88]That's snapped in place, right?
[161:31.81]And then I should be able to hold this like this and just... Okay.
[161:34.43]Did you hear that?
[161:35.07]What was that?
[161:47.62]I'm ready.
[161:50.28]We're going now, this way.
[161:52.35]Just realized, I don't have hands.
[162:02.43]To the right?
[162:02.91]I think it's literally right here.
[162:20.08]Here we go!
[162:23.10]Stink!
[162:26.16]Straight ahead.
[162:57.13]This way.

[163:48.84]4,500?
[163:48.92]I'm gonna stay in the corner over here.
[164:28.13]I'm taking this dead fucking serious.
[164:35.80]He's in here.
[165:32.05]Whew!
[165:35.07]That last one in the chamber, yeah, seriously, that's what saved me.
[165:38.87]That last one.
[165:41.89]Alright, it's time to take a hot dog, I think.
[165:43.47]No, not yet, don't do that.
[165:52.96]I have to eat this.
[165:54.62]No, I don't.
[165:55.64]Move it over here.
[165:57.22]Then this can sit in here.
[165:58.10]Alright, I'm good.
[166:00.20]That's wrong.
[166:05.15]It'll load my shit, though.
[166:07.91]This is not loaded.
[166:10.57]I just look like a total asshole.
[166:23.73]Alright.
[166:24.95]I'm ready.
[166:25.65]I got my side arms.
[166:26.63]I got my main hand.
[166:27.65]I got my three hot dogs.

[166:32.72]Eat the hot dog.
[166:33.54]Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[166:34.88]Okay.
[166:44.86]How do I eat the fucking hot dog?
[166:52.35]Did that just give me no- how much health did that give me?
[167:03.07]What do you mean wrong one?
[167:05.37]What did I just eat?
[167:06.03]I ate like a powered up one?
[167:14.83]Oh my fuck, I don't even know what- what did I just do?
[167:18.60]I ate the blue one.
[167:19.74]I don't know what kind of flavors they have.
[167:26.22]How am I supposed to know about the different kinds of hot dog flavors?
[167:33.03]Alright, supply drop is this way.
[167:39.09]At least I think it is.
[167:46.64]Down here.
[167:49.06]Hey, excuse me.
[168:11.22]problems took a little I took too many hits there I didn't want to take those hits and now now I can see why people really really like this game this is awesome there's so many different weapons and somebody they all work the way they work in reality but
[168:38.92]It's not reality, it's a virtual depiction of reality.
[168:44.32]Go figure.
[168:46.22]Am I even facing you guys?
[168:47.36]I should be.
[168:47.76]Alright, so where am I going, down here?
[168:55.83]I feel like I've been in this one for a long time though.
[169:03.82]How long has this stream been up for?
[169:16.02]Yeah, I've been playing this one for a long time.
[169:19.54]I'm still having fun, though.
[169:24.19]I mean... Remember, I had two days of rest, right?
[169:27.47]So that doesn't mean that we... This is not going to be like a three to four hour stream.
[169:30.97]I had two days of goddamn rest.
[169:33.17]My eyes are locked in.
[169:35.89]I feel locked in.
[169:37.49]I can go for longer, don't worry.
[169:39.93]So this is not... Is this the supply drop that it's trying to tell me to go to?
[169:44.59]That's kind of unfair.
[169:57.97]That's what I was aiming for.
[170:10.55]Who else is there?
[170:20.14]Come on.

[175:10.46]I even got a haircut too.
[175:12.76]You can't tell.
[175:13.88]Why didn't you tell me that you could notice my hair?
[175:15.84]Alright, we're back in.

[175:36.27]Like, can you see what I'm doing?
[175:37.55]How are we?
[175:39.02]This is the first time I've come out in like three hours.
[175:40.60]Somebody just gave 20 community subs.
[175:46.47]Great Canadian Fuck Club just gave 20 community subs.
[175:48.69]Holy shit, thank you.
[175:51.17]That's a lot of subs.
[175:54.41]Damn.
[175:58.05]Well, thank you so much for that.
[176:00.69]Alright, maybe like one more sip of my fucking Dunkin' Donuts.
[176:02.95]It's the first time I've had Dunkin' Donuts in four and a half months.
[176:09.75]It's pretty bad.
[176:18.11]Alright, I'm ready to get back in here.
[176:26.65]That feels better.
[176:28.45]Just move my hair out of the way a little.
[176:30.35]Let's get the tuck behind the ears.
[176:36.75]Alright, so I ended up with this shit.
[176:41.24]Yeah, you are.
[176:43.52]Why do I not use both earbuds?
[176:45.76]Uh, because there's something wrong with me.
[176:48.40]And for some reason when I put in two earbuds, even if it's back, even if it's the back ones, the ones that are open back, uh, it feels like the world is going to crush me.
[176:58.07]Uh, and I can't talk, I can't think, I can't, I can't do anything, I can barely see.
[177:02.83]Both ears blocked, I become useless.
[177:07.25]Okay, you know, uh, Superman has the kryptonite, and if you ever show up with kryptonite and you, like, hold it out like this, he'll be like, ah!
[177:13.87]And he, like, won't be able to do anything, and his laser eyes don't work.
[177:16.91]If you ever, like, are in a fight with me, just, like, cover my ears, and I'll be like... I'll roll over like a fucking... like a dog on his back and put his paws in the air.
[177:33.09]Stop talking about cryptocurrency?
[177:36.31]What are you talking about?
[177:39.11]When did I bring up cryptocurrency?
[177:45.39]Are there huge subs again?

[177:49.52]10 more came in?
[177:57.48]From who?

[178:08.26]You guys rock.
[178:08.90]Alright, we had our little break.
[178:11.04]We didn't actually have a real break, but, you know, we'll take one of those later.
[178:14.42]I've got my grenade launcher, I've got my super gun, my fast shooting gun, and my sidearm gun.
[178:23.37]Let's go ahead and take out some bad guys, what do you say?
[178:34.10]So the enemies just get progressively harder, I'm assuming, right?
[178:40.21]Alright, let's make it.
[178:41.01]I'm stepping all over something.
[179:20.38]We good?

[179:46.47]Let's activate it.
[180:32.94]Whoa, whoa, fuck that.
[181:20.32]Call of Duty noob tube camping.
[181:31.23]I did it!
[181:49.96]Modern Warcraft 2, yeah.
[181:53.46]This is all I needed at the end of the match.
[181:54.74]I just needed a bunch of people on voice chat to call me horrible fucking names.
[182:05.09]We just need like people screaming fucking swears at me now.
[182:10.68]Fucking noob tube.
[182:13.62]Get out of my game.
[182:14.30]Get out of my game!
[182:17.67]And then you hear, this is what you hear.
[182:19.42]I mean, I can't really simulate that well, but you know, the kid gets his headset on and it's like, I just spit all over my, you know, you know, you understand.
[182:38.40]I said fucking put the headset on and get into his mouth.
[182:40.38]Alright, we're going this way.
[182:46.98]Right, this way?
[182:51.90]I think it's this way.
[182:54.43]Could be wrong.
[182:59.87]How you guys doing on the puke meter, by the way?

[183:28.77]I don't know.
[183:29.11]I have no real-time definition of what happened.
[183:33.55]If I make like a Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 reference, bang, did it land?
[183:41.19]How does it vibe compared to the PSVR?
[183:42.91]They're not even in the same category.
[183:46.32]The PSVR is not even, you shouldn't even mention it in the same sentence.
[183:53.91]Alright, supply drop.

[224:46.08]I can see why people would spend a shitload of time in here.
[224:50.90]But I'm gonna go pee, we're gonna come back, we're gonna do another game.
[224:53.78]I almost just fell over.
[224:54.76]Because I turned around too fast.
[224:57.90]And I'm tangled up.
[224:59.24]So I'll be right back.
[225:03.25]I could sink hours into this game just throwing shit at people, shooting stuff.
[225:07.99]So I can understand the appeal.
[225:11.03]I'll see you in like two or three minutes.
[225:12.71]Just gonna go pee, grab a water.
[225:14.96]and we'll move on to something else be right back
[228:28.93]okay so I got some water so the choices are let me see I have jet island waltz of the wizard jet island
[228:58.60]Yeah, Jet Island looked crazy.
[229:03.66]I also have Duck Season.
[229:09.57]I wish Gorn worked.
[229:11.67]That's so unfortunate.
[229:15.55]Yeah, we'll do Jet Island.
[229:24.02]Yeah, Jet Island is... Change the game name here.
[229:30.77]That was really fun, though.
[229:35.42]Just kind of a gun sandbox.
[229:42.44]More blade and sorcery?
[229:44.12]I could.
[229:44.64]I want to try to experience as much as I can, though.
[229:52.64]So we'll do Jedi Island.
[229:55.96]Duck season is a whole experience, isn't it?
[230:05.98]Alright, Jet Island.
[230:09.04]Here we go.
[230:15.32]It's got like 12 unique endings, really.
[230:21.29]Duck Season's like a neat little couple hour long package.
[230:23.35]Oh, it's like super hot?
[230:25.11]That's cool.
[230:27.43]Alright, I'm getting back in.
[230:28.75]I'm gonna do Jet Island.
[230:32.67]And by the way, so after today, I think we're going to put the Vive away for a little while.
[230:42.88]This will be the third Vive stream in a row.
[230:51.60]Feels bad.
[230:52.55]Put away.
[230:56.05]Just become a Vive-only streamer.
[230:57.93]I can't do that, though.
[231:00.35]I like physically wouldn't be able to do that.
[231:01.97]That means I have to like exercise every day.
[231:09.63]That's a big commitment to exercise every single day.
[231:18.26]Alright, here we go.

[246:20.43]Okay.
[247:09.78]Okay!
[247:11.10]Oh, okay, so
[247:41.35]I don't really, I can't make out what this means.
[247:44.49]One, two, two, two, three, four.
[247:54.10]Close it up.
[247:57.36]Okay, there's like an octopus over there.
[248:13.23]This is ridiculous looking.
[248:15.77]I'll say that.
[248:20.09]What?
[248:20.29]Alright, now that it's more out in the open here, I feel a little less pukey.
[248:33.12]What is that?
[248:33.60]A checkpoint, okay.
[249:38.51]Woo!
[249:40.07]I can feel that from a mile away.
[249:43.47]Any more?
[249:43.79]Holy fuck!
[249:46.49]This is too much.
[249:54.86]Get out of my life.
[250:03.14]That's it right there.
[250:03.94]So what do I get for that?
[250:07.22]Anything?
[250:12.91]Pretty decent cutscene.
[250:16.49]Oh, Cox is really fucking going crazy.
[250:25.24]How is it?
[250:25.60]Are we good now?
[250:26.34]How bad is it?
[250:27.96]Still bad?
[250:31.78]Sorry about that.
[250:39.49]If you could play this and get the hang of the movement,
[250:43.14]My God, some people probably are insane with this game.
[250:50.93]You master the movement.
[250:52.70]Are they supposed to touch that?
[251:22.47]A hookshot retract unlocked.
[251:26.13]Really?
[251:26.45]So what does that mean?
[251:28.95]Hold, trigger, and hookshot.
[251:34.63]You can pull yourself in.
[251:39.31]Oh, wow.
[251:43.04]Okay.
[251:44.16]Sounds cool to me.
[251:44.98]Let's go.
[251:45.44]No, no.
[251:46.60]This way.
[251:46.98]Are we still caught?
[252:17.76]This game's really cool too.
[252:18.98]Alright, just get on my board.
[252:21.99]Checkpoint.
[252:22.65]Jump.
[252:47.25]What was that?
[252:55.41]It's just like tribes ascend.
[252:57.05]Hold on.
[253:32.26]So where are the more monsters?
[253:36.14]There's a huge one in the sky.
[253:37.48]What about over here?
[253:38.86]I wanna go that way.
[253:39.94]There's a loop-de-loop right there.
[253:41.52]I don't know why the hell I didn't hit that.
[253:44.91]Up this way.
[253:57.89]Jesus.
[254:06.47]I want to go kill the dragon.
[254:12.18]What is this?
[254:14.24]Boost?
[254:14.80]Whoa.
[254:15.72]Holy shit.
[254:46.32]I'm too overwhelmed.
[254:54.01]I don't know where to go.
[254:59.41]Maybe like over this way?
[255:01.95]Let's go try to get this fucking giant bug thing.
[255:09.50]Maybe the huge centipede.
[255:10.56]We have to see what the hell that is.
[255:25.35]Come on.
[255:41.02]There's something up there.
[255:47.59]You guys see that?
[256:27.49]What the fuck?
[256:28.55]There's so much to look at.
[256:29.94]This is just a, I don't even know what to say.
[256:32.18]All I know is my hair's being pulled.
[256:36.02]Should I sit in that?
[256:41.23]I'm gonna sit in that.
[257:17.51]Alright, here it comes.
[257:30.66]Ready?
[257:36.38]Uh-oh.
[257:37.96]Uh-oh.
[257:44.25]Oh, I did it.
[257:44.91]I did it.
[257:45.33]I did it.
[257:45.65]I did it.
[257:45.89]We're waiting to stay here in the wolf.
[257:47.77]What do I do?
[257:48.57]Just stand here?
[257:49.17]Fuck.
[258:21.65]I made it, to the other side.
[258:39.08]Alright, it's cool, but I'm gonna throw up.
[258:41.02]Yeah, I feel the same way.
[258:43.58]Put the board on your back.
[258:44.62]I didn't even know you could do that.
[258:51.48]I got that, right?
[258:52.20]Yeah.
[258:54.86]So I'm gonna assume this way.
[258:56.34]Once I get to the end of here, I'm gonna take another break.
[259:02.07]It's too much for my brain.
[259:08.51]There's probably something up there.
[259:09.35]There's a big lighthouse up there.
[259:10.49]That was awesome.
[259:41.86]I see it!
[259:42.44]I see it!
[259:42.92]I see it!
[259:55.30]Okay.
[259:59.62]Be easy here, Jeremy.
[260:16.20]It's so fucking horrible.
[260:22.81]I lost my sound.
[260:36.96]That structure looks different, let me look at it.
[260:38.48]Is it gonna come alive?
[260:44.07]This looks like it's gonna be alive.
[260:45.83]It's not.
[260:52.82]Look at how high up you can go, too.
[260:54.18]This is ridiculous.
[261:05.02]Right up there.
[261:05.48]Up, up, up.
[261:07.76]Right up there.
[261:31.31]An octopus?
[261:41.87]Holy shit!
[261:56.86]It's getting worse.
[261:57.66]Is it really?
[262:00.31]Wait, look.
[262:02.54]That's irritating.
[262:05.26]Oh, my back.
[262:07.16]That, like, hurt my whole body.
[262:08.42]I need to, like, go lose something.
[262:10.49]I feel like there's so much cool shit to do in this game, but I'm not doing it.
[262:16.71]Well, I got, like, launched by the catapult.
[262:18.53]That was fucking cool.
[262:21.11]Oh, my back.
[262:21.65]Come on, give me enough to get back.
[262:31.01]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[262:37.12]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[262:43.26]Did I just smash my face?
[262:44.45]What was the glass that I just shattered?
[263:00.78]I'm going after the centipede.
[263:32.55]I'm starting to fall.
[263:34.45]Now I understand the warning.
[263:36.43]Alright, here we go.
[263:49.88]Just like Spider-Man.
[264:19.04]Alright, um, getting close.
[264:21.74]Oh, look at this perfect scene.
[264:43.91]Come here!
[264:54.75]I don't know.
[265:08.71]No!
[265:09.17]Face.
[265:14.63]What the hell is in here?
[265:16.71]Oh, just a shitload of spikes that I'm absolutely gonna die on.
[265:21.00]Stop!
[265:21.72]Stop!
[265:38.73]Hold on, let it recharge.
[265:39.61]This is some Adventure Time bullshit right here.
[265:47.48]Is it gonna make me go fast?
[265:54.48]This is a boost, right?
[266:19.06]Damn it.
[266:21.02]Damn it.
[266:26.08]I need to do something.
[266:30.44]It looks like there's a million ways to go, but I don't know which way is the way to go.
[266:34.03]Do you see any other monsters or things I should try to do?
[266:48.36]It's the red lighthouses.
[266:50.54]Okay.
[266:52.16]I was close to one before.
[266:54.00]Let's go to that one.
[267:10.93]Right there.
[267:11.63]There we go.
[267:12.17]Alright, there's one coming up right here.
[267:23.03]Just don't crash into a spike.
[267:24.84]Or that, or that, or that.
[267:26.92]Alright, we've got some jumps here.
[268:22.19]There it is.
[268:22.55]Gotta get a good swing here or I'm dead.
[268:40.92]Good swing or I'm dead.
[269:20.10]Try it another way.
[269:59.02]Why am I dropping like a second like a fucking brick?
[270:01.26]What the hell is this?
[270:40.44]I'm tangled!
[270:42.44]I'm tangled up!
[270:43.78]I'm tangled up bad.
[270:45.14]Real bad, actually.
[270:46.08]Like, bad.
[270:46.88]Really bad.
[270:53.22]Put me in his gun!
[270:59.48]How the fuck is that?
[271:02.05]Sayonara.
[271:14.72]What'd I get?
[271:23.99]Drone defeated.
[271:30.21]Wind resistance up.
[271:38.53]This is fucking really cool.
[271:44.79]This is awesome.
[271:45.71]Alright, lighthouse.
[271:46.59]Another lighthouse.
[271:47.25]Let's go.
[271:52.85]I see a lighthouse over there.
[271:55.92]And there is one of these things.
[272:00.74]My hands are so sweaty.
[272:04.50]As long as it doesn't kill me, I don't care.
[272:23.13]Oh, this steering is gonna kill me.
[272:54.88]I don't have to spin around this whole thing, aren't I?
[272:58.22]Don't get tangled up.
[272:59.38]Alright, we got a jump right here.
[273:00.98]We're going all the way to the bottom, apparently.
[273:18.25]Get...
[274:03.31]Alright, I got a little jump pad here.
[274:05.47]Ooh, fuck.
[274:06.21]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
[274:07.09]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[274:12.78]Dude.
[274:16.74]I'm gonna fucking smash into a wall.
[274:18.58]I know it.
[274:28.11]So...
[274:29.69]God damn it, man.
[274:30.91]Like... That... You have to get this wireless.
[274:35.23]Like, you gotta get it wireless.
[274:37.51]Or we'll be sitting down.
[274:38.79]This shit wraps around you like a fucking bubble constrictor.
[274:42.31]Alright, here we go.
[275:03.12]so god damn it man like that you have to get this wireless like you got to get it wireless or it'd be sitting down this wraps around you like a bubble constrictor
[275:33.39]Alright, here we go.
[275:37.59]What do we got?
[275:40.00]I took the fucking board off!
[276:12.28]I have the audio again.
[276:57.42]Is there nothing up here?
[277:08.82]Just stay here.
[277:09.86]Don't move.
[277:10.40]Stop moving.
[277:15.63]I don't think there's anything I can do up here.
[277:23.91]Go down the hole.
[277:26.69]Hold on, there's a 15-foot snake attached to my body right now.
[277:29.84]Hold on, guys.
[277:31.60]I can't even put my headphone in.
[278:07.05]My headphones on its back.
[278:08.12]Yeah, it fucking fell out because my ears are sweating profusely.
[278:15.10]It's just oil in my ears.
[278:16.42]They're just going to slip out.
[278:17.76]Let me land right here so I can put my fucking headphones in.
[278:20.37]Get off the board.
[278:21.67]I'm going to push these in as hard as I can.
[278:31.94]They're going to go into my brain.
[278:39.96]Yeah, like this shit, I can't even hear myself talk.
[278:44.11]I have literally no idea what I'm saying right now.
[278:46.65]This is, I can't, it's just an earthquake.
[278:53.41]Alright, so you guys were talking about, I feel like I'm at a construction yard, and I'm trying to talk to somebody over one of those cat machines dripping up dirt behind me.
[279:09.76]There's a hole.
[279:12.58]Oh, that's loud.
[279:43.76]Up or down?
[279:54.45]Down, down, down.
[280:21.49]Found a hole!
[280:42.59]I thought I got it.
[281:49.05]I hit the demon in the door.
[281:51.93]I can't hear anything.
[281:55.66]I can't do it with the headphone in.
[283:09.95]Humans were not supposed to do this.
[283:16.40]This would have killed a caveman if he had put this on.
[283:20.66]A caveman would have put this on and instantly died.
[283:44.75]Grab him!
[283:46.98]I can't grab this motherfucker.
[283:48.54]What the fuck is going on here?
[284:35.03]Fuck yeah!
[285:22.60]He's gonna shoot me!
[285:24.22]He's gonna shoot me!
[285:25.44]Get on the board!
[285:28.26]He's gonna shoot me!
[285:33.37]How do I get out of here?
[285:41.32]Is he collapsing?
[286:10.13]Holy shit.
[286:10.71]Where's my stuff?
[286:19.82]Where's my unlockable?
[286:23.20]Did I get a new unlockable?
[286:54.41]If I touch these spikes, I'm gonna be so angry.
[287:51.51]Get out of here.
[288:01.39]Long laser.
[288:03.49]Ooh, that's pretty cool.
[288:07.43]So I have a much longer shot.
[288:09.45]That's really great, okay.
[288:18.00]Sniper shot.
[288:22.76]How are you guys doing?
[288:34.51]Is Cox just fucking with it?
[288:36.47]How many frames have we dropped?
[288:37.79]Let me see.
[288:41.58]A lot, actually.
[288:44.46]That's a lot.
[288:49.22]Well, don't ask me why.
[289:00.88]I'm guessing out that way.
[289:08.76]That looks pretty good.
[289:16.95]If I were to guess at the other...
[289:54.68]I can't do that.
[289:55.22]I can't look up for that long.
[289:56.52]I'll actually throw up and fall down.
[290:05.90]Damn it, I don't wanna like have to take a break.
[290:08.30]This is like so fun.
[290:14.34]But honest to God, it's like riding a Disney ride for like an hour.
[290:19.62]You know the Transformers ride at Disney World?
[290:21.96]Where are you guys?
[290:24.01]Okay, you know the Transformers ride at Disney World?
[290:27.83]Imagine if you were on that ride for an hour straight and you couldn't get off.
[290:33.97]That's like a 14 minute experience, if that.
[291:05.98]I'm starting to get a little greasy here.
[291:17.01]Okay.
[291:26.80]Where's my water?
[291:28.36]I need one of those.
[291:34.70]Yeah, what the fuck is going on with the internet?
[291:38.70]The internet really sucks, huh?
[291:55.59]Welcome back to the world.
[291:56.47]Let me just see if there's like any... I don't have any like messages or anything about it.
[292:08.87]Back Down Home went the wrong way?
[292:10.30]Really?
[292:17.16]Chat's angry.
[292:19.14]Well, so am I. It's a load of... This is like 10,000 frames drop.
[292:25.27]It's a load of bullshit.
[292:31.25]You gonna do horror VRs?
[292:32.35]Absolutely.
[292:34.17]But I wanna do some of the most requested ones.
[292:40.88]That's a lot of VR.
[292:43.14]What the fuck?
[292:44.49]When did this start happening?
[292:46.51]Like an hour ago?
[292:47.09]Alright.
[292:59.60]Have I played Sarento?
[293:01.14]No, not yet.
[293:06.53]I wonder if I feel ill watching this because of VR because I barely started an essay.
[293:10.92]No, I think it's because of this game.
[293:13.32]This game is incredibly intense.
[293:15.02]Alright, well, sorry that we're dropping frames, but... I can really only realistically play this game for like another... Maybe like another 20-30 minutes.
[293:42.10]Let's go back in.
[293:46.72]New game.
[293:49.08]We'll see how I feel.
[293:50.10]I've been in it for about five hours.
[293:51.52]We'll see how I feel after this.
[293:53.90]I want to try to get... Hold on, my hair's all fucked up.
[293:58.97]Just play till you puke.
[294:06.99]There's a tunnel back down in the hole?
[294:08.53]Really?
[294:09.34]God damn it.
[294:13.62]Duck season?
[294:14.24]Yeah, that's... I'm gonna play them.
[294:18.62]I'm gonna play all of them.
[294:20.06]Eventually.
[294:22.54]But you do kind of have to give yourself a break.
[294:27.37]Because I've essentially... Over the last three... Oh, look, okay.
[294:32.75]Thanks for coming to the stream.
[294:36.64]Uh...
[294:38.37]Realistically, I mean, I've got like 15, 16, 17 hours in VR in three days.
[294:44.21]This is more physical activity I think I've had in the last year.
[294:53.92]Go back in the hole?
[294:54.62]Alright, let's go in the hole.
[294:56.56]I missed a tunnel.
[295:00.67]Where's the secret tunnel?
[295:11.36]I don't think that's it.
[295:12.12]I don't think I get a good view.
[295:16.80]Tunnel.
[295:17.20]Secret tunnel.
[295:18.24]Tunnel.
[295:21.74]Oh my god, that hurts.
[295:35.55]Spiral ramp?
[295:37.81]Thank you.
[295:54.06]I'm like holding this button down.
[295:55.22]Oh man, I'm getting, I... This is probably going to be the end here very soon.
[296:01.99]I just start to feel my marbles scrambling.
[296:11.41]Alright, spiral up this way.
[296:24.96]Let's go, let's just do the loop-de-loop.
[296:37.09]Up there?
[296:37.77]That way?
[297:57.05]Yeah, I'm gonna get out of this hole.
[298:06.07]I gotta stop.
[298:08.57]That's just the way it is.
[298:12.85]I can't even fucking function right now.
[298:56.48]Am I going the right way?
[299:06.50]Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is it, right?
[299:07.82]Alright, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow.
[299:16.99]Why, get off, what are you, what the fuck?
[299:35.33]Alright.
[299:35.89]You gotta know when to quit.
[299:38.79]We're there.
[299:40.49]Look at how slow to react I am.
[299:42.51]I just kept putting a jar and shook it.
[300:21.52]That way!
[300:40.15]I wonder how many people have left the stream because this game is like making them puke.
[300:46.20]I'm sorry.
[300:48.30]I'm sorry, but this is still fun though.
[300:49.92]Alright, another alien.
[300:53.72]I'll get it.
[301:37.04]Come on, I gotta hit him one shot.
[301:40.31]Why am I holding my skateboard?
[301:49.63]Yes!
[301:50.93]No, no, I'm too far away.
[302:33.80]What do I get for this?
[302:38.02]Drone defeated.
[302:44.18]Jet fuel.
[302:45.04]Oh, nice.
[302:45.40]There's no next.
[302:52.46]He's making himself sick so he doesn't have to play another game.
[302:57.34]No, I'm alright.
[302:57.96]I'm good.
[302:59.34]I'm good.
[302:59.72]Don't worry about me.
[303:00.40]I'm fine.
[303:00.66]I don't know where you guys are.
[303:04.45]There you are.
[303:05.59]He's making himself sick.
[303:09.49]Alright, one more lighthouse.
[303:10.83]And then that's it.
[303:12.47]What over there?
[303:27.07]This game is surprisingly player-friendly, not viewer-friendly.
[303:30.95]Yeah, it probably isn't.
[303:33.35]You guys are probably fucking sick right now.
[303:40.35]It's really fun.
[303:52.57]You lost a thousand viewers.
[303:55.40]Well, I don't blame you.
[303:59.34]You know?
[304:00.70]I don't blame you.
[304:02.92]If you can't watch something like this, you can't watch it.
[304:05.72]You know, if a thousand people leave, it's just because it's like, I can't physically watch you play this.
[304:09.95]That's alright.
[304:16.77]Let me get a better view.
[304:20.72]Alright, let me just ski over there and see.
[304:22.22]Let me just see what that is.
[304:24.08]And once I see what that is, we're probably gonna stop.
[304:42.02]I know what that is.
[305:13.76]Look at how beautiful that is over there, though.
[305:16.59]Alright, we're almost there.
[305:18.57]Almost there.
[305:23.92]I got more jet fuel.
[305:32.93]Oh, dear.
[305:33.99]Great.
[306:17.97]We're so close.
[306:24.67]Use this thing this way.
[306:33.63]Up there.
[306:42.35]That was pretty perfect.
[306:48.81]Accidental perfect, but perfect nonetheless.
[307:01.86]Oh, try to go that way.
[307:02.96]Ah.
[307:03.08]Pain in the ass.
[307:06.62]There it is.
[307:23.96]Easy.
[307:25.82]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, go this way.
[307:54.84]Alright, I made it.
[307:56.66]Just gotta get up the top of the tower.
[308:09.45]There we go!
[308:19.22]What do I gotta shoot?
[308:20.46]Another fucking hole.
[308:21.40]Another damn hole.
[308:31.41]Is this the same hole that I went in before?
[308:32.83]This is not the same one, is it?
[308:54.43]Okay, here we go.
[308:56.35]Jesus Christ, I just felt that, for real.
[309:11.39]Okay, watch out for the star explosion things.
[309:13.91]They definitely explode.
[309:20.47]Oh, this is bad.
[309:26.82]I'm gonna have to do, like, spike stuff now.
[309:29.04]Not looking forward to this.
[310:24.60]I made it.
[310:47.00]I'm playing just Counter-Strike Surf.
[311:06.31]Now where?
[311:06.79]Is this like a boss or is this like a room of obstacles?
[311:17.51]Charged up.
[311:19.23]Okay, hold on.
[311:25.14]Wait, wait, wait.
[311:33.82]Are those spikes?
[311:35.88]Oh, shit.
[311:50.11]Right, right there.
[311:51.48]This way.
[312:14.55]You think I'm not fucking smart about this shit?
[312:35.09]Don't hit the speed boost.
[312:59.39]Got it.
[313:00.75]Let's go.
[313:15.54]What?
[313:16.60]Now what?
[313:18.16]This way?
[313:21.50]I can't believe I made it down that.
[313:27.81]Get off, get off, get off.
[313:28.81]I'm not going to run into a spike right now.
[313:40.12]You're supposed to go fast.
[313:41.32]Oh, that's fine.
[313:45.16]But fast is dead.
[314:04.80]Stop.
[314:05.28]Stop.
[314:06.38]Yeah, right.
[314:07.38]Yeah, right.
[314:07.86]That ain't... That's not gonna... No.
[314:09.78]That's not gonna happen.
[314:32.92]Wow!
[314:40.10]Yeah!
[314:53.38]Wow.
[314:57.51]I can't believe I just went through that.
[314:58.51]There's even more of this bullshit?
[315:11.38]How far down does that go?
[315:41.64]Yeah, what's the deal here?
[315:44.46]Oh boy.
[315:50.43]Oh my god.
[315:55.81]Holy shit.
[315:56.87]Alright, let's calm down.
[316:11.65]It's in his mouth.
[316:26.08]Come on, give me something to work with here.
[316:52.22]Right in the mouth.
[316:55.85]Right on the tree.
[317:33.54]I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out!
[317:50.41]Get up there, come on!
[317:58.03]Open wide, motherfucker!
[318:33.35]No!
[318:33.83]It's alright, I'm right here.
[319:15.54]Tail.
[319:16.75]Tail!
[319:46.83]Dang it!
[319:50.84]How does that turn into a SpongeBob?
[320:32.80]Son of a bitch!
[320:50.00]Still high up!
[320:53.94]Might need something better to swing onto.
[321:32.83]Come here you bastard!
[322:23.78]You're a motherfucker!
[322:26.16]That's how we do it!
[322:27.72]That's how we do it here!
[322:33.13]One more.
[322:48.20]Where is it?
[323:00.12]No, no, where is it?
[323:01.38]Stomach?
[323:01.92]Stomach, I think.
[323:02.94]Bingo, right here.
[323:06.67]I'm coming for you!
[323:08.63]I'm coming for that stomach!
[323:10.60]Too slow, too fast.
[323:56.68]Oops.
[323:59.88]It's got to be up there, right?
[324:02.74]Is it up there?
[324:04.29]It's got to be in there.
[324:29.24]Damn!
[324:30.96]Damn!
[324:32.55]Damn!
[324:59.74]Fuck you!
[325:00.22]Get out of my way!
[325:10.88]Come on, Luke!
[325:11.96]Come on, Luke!
[325:13.96]Come on, Luke!
[325:16.10]Got it!
[325:17.90]No!
[325:18.20]Watch out for the split!
[325:21.86]Slow down, slow!
[325:24.33]Oh, it bounced around!
[325:26.13]Where?
[325:26.37]I don't know where I am.
[325:27.15]Up, what's up?
[325:27.63]Is up is down?
[325:28.25]Up, down is up!
[325:30.44]Not into the spikes, easy folks.
[325:32.78]Easy folks!
[325:40.68]Where the fuck did I go?
[325:42.36]Right there.
[325:51.06]Bring it in!
[325:55.17]Woo!
[325:58.13]Nice sound effects.
[326:17.33]See you in hell.
[326:21.09]I should get out of here.
[326:23.19]I should get out of here.
[326:24.18]I gotta get out of here.
[326:25.46]I gotta move.
[326:31.94]Out the front.
[326:34.69]No, I cannot.
[326:36.11]Shoot it again.
[326:37.03]Shoot it again.
[327:13.90]Holy shit.
[327:16.68]This game is awesome.
[327:18.95]This is awesome.
[327:20.09]This is... Wow.
[327:21.65]Alright, where's my upgrade?
[327:31.98]I thought one of the spikes was going to come and just crush me.
[327:34.14]That would have been so horrible.
[327:37.14]Hold on, let me get situated.
[327:37.96]There you are.
[327:48.02]That was a full pucker.
[327:49.34]I thought I was gonna get crushed.
[327:55.00]Yeah, at first I wasn't so sure about this game.
[327:58.10]It's a little puke-inducing, but once you get used to it, man, you just track down gigantic mechanical monsters and kill them.
[328:08.81]It's really, really cool.
[328:11.15]Hold on, I got something stuck.
[328:13.98]That's not gonna get undone.
[328:14.92]Alright, let's go up here.
[328:19.46]If I were a upgrade, where would I be?
[328:25.92]Easy.
[328:29.37]Alright, something's pulling here.
[328:59.40]I don't see it.
[329:00.18]Maybe up a little higher?
[329:30.78]Probably get a good angle down here.
[329:37.50]Well, there it is.
[329:53.17]Give me the ball.
[329:55.35]Give me the ball.
[329:56.79]Give me the ball!
[330:06.97]Bend knees and stand up.
[330:09.91]Really?
[330:16.22]Bend knees and stand up, huh?
[330:42.43]On the board, that crack sound.
[331:12.54]though, because I will fall over.
[331:13.50]Alright, I'm going to have to call it here.
[331:17.59]I'm exhausted.
[331:19.55]But damn, that was fucking fun.
[331:22.17]Sorry to all the people that could not handle it.
[331:26.48]I could barely handle it too, but let me just get out of this.
[331:46.70]Wait, what?
[331:47.30]I don't know where to go.
[332:23.02]Is there anywhere else I can shoot?
[332:40.77]Got... Looking for a blue orb.
[332:44.59]If you see it, scream.
[332:45.69]Right in his face, maybe?
[332:52.90]Might be right down Main Street there.
[332:56.98]Let's find out.
[332:57.83]I'll get there.
[333:15.38]Too much.
[333:25.81]This is outrageous.
[333:53.87]Alright, let's take a look at that big ugly mug of yours.
[333:56.10]What do you say?
[334:10.50]Oh shit.
[334:15.79]Can't get in there, it's closed off.
[334:35.87]Well, he's probably the last boss.
[335:03.02]I gotta stop.
[335:04.06]As much as I want to keep going.
[335:15.50]This is a blast.
[335:28.03]Come back to it another time?
[335:29.07]Probably.
[335:30.87]God, it's so much fun.
[335:40.29]Forgot- what do you mean?
[335:41.01]Forgot to save?
[335:42.25]Doesn't it- does auto save?
[335:49.06]Wait, I actually have to save the game?
[335:56.38]No, I know how to save you.
[335:59.94]Oh, boy, oh, boy.
[336:00.98]Well, thank you for joining me for another VR adventure.
[336:03.65]It was a lot of fun.
[336:07.11]Sorry for the shitload of people that left the stream because I couldn't handle it.
[336:11.19]And speaking of can't handle it... I look fucking ridiculous.
[336:20.36]This looks like I tried to do this.
[336:22.78]Doesn't it?
[336:24.14]I put gel in my hair and styled it to look like this.
[336:30.29]What time is it, too?
[336:30.95]Is it late?
[336:33.19]Eh, it's getting there.
[336:37.47]The little, yeah, look at this.
[336:41.96]I swear, okay, if I go like this, and if I pull, the whole thing's gonna come out.
[336:48.99]I could just go and the whole thing would come off.
[336:55.70]You look like you live under a bridge.
[336:58.38]Hey, but come on.
[336:59.22]Pac-Man.
[337:03.57]I'm not pulling it.
[337:04.31]I'm not going to do it.
[337:08.83]But thank you for joining me, everybody.
[337:09.87]I'll see you guys.
[337:11.84]I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[337:14.66]So today is Wednesday, tomorrow's Thursday.
[337:16.42]I'm gonna go Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[337:18.52]We're gonna do it three days in a row.
[337:21.70]We're gonna go back.
[337:26.45]We're gonna go back to the Dreamcast.
[337:31.03]We're gonna move VR out of the way for a week or so.
[337:35.76]Because I do need a little break from it.
[337:37.98]My hair needs a break.
[337:40.60]So we're going to go back to Seaman and Space Channel 5.
[337:45.45]Part 1.
[337:47.35]So we'll see if we can complete both those tomorrow.
[337:49.31]Not tomorrow, I mean the next day.
[337:50.69]Day after tomorrow.
[337:55.73]So yeah, I have the microphone.
[337:56.95]Look.
[337:57.83]Here.
[337:59.17]It's here.
[338:00.45]It only took a million years for me to get it.
[338:04.30]VR is some of the most fun I've had on your streams.
[338:06.02]Oh, me too.
[338:06.52]They're fucking awesome.
[338:08.44]But remember, we can't just blow through it.
[338:11.52]I want to enjoy every experience.
[338:13.74]I don't want to just like, hey, VR tomorrow, VR the next day, let's do VR for three straight weeks.
[338:17.94]VR only!
[338:22.34]It'll start to... I gotta give myself a break.
[338:27.38]So, we'll go back to VR next week.
[338:31.30]So for the purposes of the remaining streams, I got a couple of Dreamcast things.
[338:36.28]I got a shitload of PlayStation 2 games for some crazy reason.
[338:39.80]I don't know why.
[338:40.32]They look fun though.
[338:42.20]And the stream just went to zero.
[338:43.99]I guess not.
[338:47.85]There's also some new games that came out that I'd like to try.
[338:50.07]Yeah, sorry about the internet issues too.
[338:59.38]And with that, we're going to move on.
[339:00.56]I'll see you guys, if you're taking off, I'll see you on Thursday.
[339:04.02]Oh, not Thursday.
[339:04.66]Technically, yeah, no, Friday.
[339:06.66]Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[339:08.02]I'm going to go three straight days.
[339:11.09]I'm blocking it out for you.
[339:13.71]VR is going to take a break.
[339:16.17]Let's do the bits.
[339:21.90]I want to get in there, though.
[339:22.78]I'll keep playing.
[339:23.48]It's so much fun.
[339:30.62]Yeah, Metro does look good.
[339:31.80]There's a lot of things look good.
[339:32.98]I gotta pull myself out of the virtual world for a little while.
[339:42.19]So, we went just about six hours here tonight.
[339:47.49]Back earlier, we got... Let's see here.
[339:50.35]We got five dollars from... Five dollars from Tish Chaboy for five bucks.
[339:59.61]Hey Jerma, love your content.
[340:00.41]I have a perfect school.
[340:01.97]I have a... I have a project for school where I interview role models.
[340:06.35]And I was wondering if you were interested.
[340:07.43]I already emailed you some of the details.
[340:09.69]Love you, Jerma.
[340:11.51]Uh... Somebody else was talking about that too.
[340:13.67]Wasn't Pin talking about the interview stuff?
[340:17.37]All jokes aside, I really don't, like, do interviews.
[340:20.58]I'm gonna give... Let's give a general, gigantic clip here.
[340:24.64]Alright, here you go.
[340:27.56]So when I started...
[340:31.40]school he's too famous to do interviews he's not PR trained I don't really do for real I don't like do interviews I don't I mean I'm just kind of alright here you go here's a gigantic clip you can take yeah when I started I never thought I'd have any people watching just trying to have fun every every day I'm just trying to have fun with my friends
[341:00.84]And try to have the most experiences that we can on stream and it's a lot of fun.
[341:07.37]Here comes the commencement speech.
[341:12.39]Ah, why did my elbow just click?
[341:17.17]The ego on this guy.
[341:28.22]Make sure your Dreamcast clock battery isn't dead.
[341:30.95]Because Seaman requires it.
[341:32.91]That is a random thing that I didn't even know existed.
[341:35.71]So I'm going to definitely check into that.
[341:38.57]Thank you.
[341:43.57]But... I wish all of you luck on your projects, whether they be about me or about somebody else.
[341:54.32]But I don't do good interviews.
[341:56.00]I don't do pictures.
[341:56.72]I don't do autographs.
[341:57.70]I don't do selfies.
[342:01.18]If you stop me on the street and you're like, hey, can I get a picture?
[342:03.14]I'm like, absolutely not.
[342:12.76]No, I kid.
[342:17.00]I'm just kidding.
[342:21.22]But thank you nonetheless.
[342:22.12]I am flattered.
[342:27.84]And thank you to Sawdust Bunnies for the 10 bucks.
[342:34.35]Yay, a stream on my birthday.
[342:35.81]Happy birthday, Sawdust Bunnies.
[342:38.49]Thank you for the 10 dollars.
[342:40.19]Appreciate it.
[342:46.29]Really just getting killed here on internet, huh?
[342:54.07]Well... Uh... Well, now we're at zero.
[343:09.03]Still alive?
[343:10.05]Am I?
[343:12.24]Okay.
[343:18.42]It's very weird.
[343:20.50]Uh... I thought the problem was fixed.
[343:22.68]Maybe it's not.
[343:27.65]But thank you for the $10 on your birthday.
[343:29.85]I don't know why you're giving me $10 on your birthday.
[343:36.19]But happy birthday nonetheless.
[343:41.37]One time I asked Jeremy for a picture, and he stuck my phone down his pants, and even worse, the picture's blurry.
[343:48.88]What the fuck?
[344:00.42]Thank you, Binary Man, for the $5.
[344:01.75]First, I want to start by saying that I'm really sorry for blowing everyone's eardrums out with my bits last stream.
[344:08.49]I have no excuses, and I'm not expecting forgiveness, but I want you to know that I'm genuinely sorry.
[344:12.75]I don't know what I was thinking when I sent it.
[344:15.39]I was an idiot.
[344:16.29]I took advantage of the trust you have for your chat, and I know it's unforgivable.
[344:20.05]But know that I'm sorry.
[344:20.93]I've learned my lesson, and it will not happen again.
[344:25.28]Three-day ban is up.
[344:34.74]Uh, if that happens again... That's, uh, that's, that's goodbye.
[344:40.99]That's, uh, you know, boink.
[344:47.63]Out of town.
[344:50.79]He's supposed to post a link to an even, even louder video in that message.
[344:59.97]Thank you, Binary Man.
[345:01.24]I know you're just messing around, you're just fucking around, I know, but you gotta remember...
[345:05.44]If people aren't prepared for the noise that loud, you know, you could fucking actually mess up somebody's head.
[345:13.73]You could blow out an ear.
[345:15.55]You could fuck up a speaker.
[345:16.69]You just gotta remember, you're dealing with people just like you.
[345:20.96]You know, would you want your speaker blown out?
[345:22.48]I don't think you would.
[345:24.28]What if you had it up loud?
[345:29.05]No, you couldn't.
[345:29.57]Yeah, you could.
[345:30.65]You could, like, it'll be... The subwoofer will just blow out.
[345:33.95]And the tube in the middle will just fly out at, like, 100 miles per hour.
[345:36.89]It's dangerous shit.
[345:41.80]But thank you, Binary Man.
[345:45.74]Uh, Commando.
[345:46.50]Thank you, Commando.
[345:47.58]Uh, Commando Nam.
[345:49.28]Thanks for the two bucks.
[345:51.26]I found someone on DeviantArt who makes stuffed animals, and I'm gonna pay him in March to make a stuffed animal of you.
[346:04.02]Well, that's... I hope you have... I don't even know how to say anything without out of context this being bad.
[346:15.56]That is a thing that you're going to buy, that you're going to get made.
[346:19.66]I just hope you don't stick needles in it while chanting and trying to hurt me.
[346:33.21]If anything, like, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna do, like, uh, like a curse or something, just, like, put me in, like, a nice warm bath.
[346:41.00]Right?
[346:42.16]Do... Nobody does nice shit with one of those dolls.
[346:46.93]You know, open up, like, cook bacon.
[346:50.09]And then hold me up and just kind of swirl me around over where the bacon is cooking so I can smell it.
[346:55.05]Give me a nice warm bath.
[346:59.22]Do nice things.
[347:08.15]What do you mean that's worse?
[347:11.49]You don't think if you just woke up in the morning randomly one day and you could just smell bacon, you'd be like, wow, it smells like bacon in here.
[347:17.90]This is delicious.
[347:19.80]And I guess that would be kind of worse because then you would go to wherever your kitchen was thinking somebody made bacon and they didn't.
[347:25.94]On second thought, just stab me with the knives.
[347:27.90]That's probably better.
[347:30.41]Pluck out his chest hairs.
[347:36.13]Play loud videos to the doll.
[347:38.45]It just put my ear up to his speaker.
[347:41.49]You guys are fucking vicious.
[347:42.79]Why would you want to do that to me?
[347:47.65]What chest hairs?
[347:48.47]I got plenty.
[347:53.62]But thank you, commando.
[347:55.32]Thank you, uh, cougar for the one dollar.
[347:58.12]Jerma, Jerma, Jerma.
[347:59.10]Gimme, gimme, gimme.
[348:00.82]A hernia.
[348:03.88]What?
[348:06.89]Hey Alec, thanks for the $1.
[348:08.26]Is an HTC Vive a good investment?
[348:12.72]A... yes it is.
[348:16.50]I would put the 100% stamp of recommendation and approval on the Vive.
[348:22.72]Just the last three sessions alone was worth the $500-$600 investment to play it.
[348:33.63]Because it's a lot different.
[348:34.57]I know some of you guys have probably played it at conventions or at a friend's house or something.
[348:39.13]But when you have it in your own room and you can just go in and play it, it's a lot different than just doing like a, oh, I guess I'm going to do this for like 10 minutes.
[348:48.71]What's this, demo?
[348:49.33]It's a lot more fun.
[348:53.99]Now, what I would tell you, somebody just already mentioned it.
[348:58.11]Valve and HTC, they are coming out with a new one.
[349:01.41]It's called the Cosmo.
[349:03.78]Right?
[349:04.62]The HTC Vive Cosmo.
[349:07.90]It's not out yet.
[349:09.48]But it might be a different, maybe potentially better version of the one that currently exists.
[349:15.58]I don't know.
[349:17.80]They're not discontinuing the regular one, from what I know.
[349:26.03]Yeah.
[349:27.33]The HTC Cosmo.
[349:28.55]That is not Valve.
[349:30.13]That's HTC only.
[349:36.16]Well... They announced it very recently, so we'll see.
[349:47.50]Cosmos is different.
[349:48.86]Valve has their own in development.
[349:50.34]Really?
[349:51.92]So there's gonna be a... Cosmos?
[349:56.20]And a new Valve-only made one.
[350:01.58]You're kind of making too many... You know, that's gonna be four.
[350:08.03]That's a little weird.
[350:08.69]Because it's Vive, Vive Pro, Cosmos, and then whatever Valve is doing.
[350:19.84]Because I know they're not getting rid of the old ones.
[350:24.65]They're not going to finish it?
[350:28.33]Maybe not.
[350:29.81]But we'll see what they do.
[350:38.62]anyways we had uh yeah I would say yes it is currently for the standard default five it's 4.99 but if you like me you're kind of gonna need an accessory or two I had to get two stands to hold the lighthouses because I couldn't put them they weren't that I couldn't clamp them anywhere so that was another like 60 bucks
[351:04.45]Plus, if you want a couple extra lighthouses, you know, who knows?
[351:07.53]Depending on how big your room is or what you want to do with it.
[351:11.35]Could cost between $500 and $700.
[351:19.24]Or wireless, if you want to get the wireless thing, that's $299.
[351:27.36]Which I, like, think I have to get it.
[351:30.18]It almost makes it necessary when you're trying to do a room scale thing.
[351:35.86]Sitting down?
[351:36.84]Sure, I don't think it's necessary.
[351:39.10]Or standing only, but doing like the two or three steps forward and backwards and turning around 360?
[351:43.10]I think I have to get it.
[351:50.39]You can get some Elgato lights for cheaper than that.
[351:54.67]Ah, but these... I mean, these ones came with the bundle, so maybe you can, I don't know.
[352:03.62]But, thank you to...
[352:06.38]Where were we here?
[352:07.80]Alec.
[352:09.34]Djack, thanks for the $2.49.
[352:12.03]Thanks for all the laughs, Mr. Funnyman.
[352:13.75]Thank you for being here.
[352:14.85]And thank you for the $2.49.
[352:15.55]Divas, thanks for the $2.50.
[352:18.91]Thank you, Combine, for the $3.00.
[352:23.23]Come on down and eat some Gorn, or we'll sacrifice your newborn.
[352:27.86]Thanks, Jeremy.
[352:28.52]You're the best.
[352:30.28]I'm disappointed that I couldn't play that.
[352:34.66]I was really looking forward to that, too.
[352:37.44]I guess it just kind of, something was wrong with the new update or something.
[352:44.93]We'll try it again.
[352:46.73]Next time we do Vive.
[352:48.23]Because it does look very fun.
[352:57.65]Thank you Topac for the $2.50.
[353:00.13]Check out what chat drew of you.
[353:02.05]I've pre-screened it so it's nothing to worry about.
[353:06.26]I've pre-screened it.
[353:17.00]Wow.
[353:17.56]Brought to you by fruit.
[353:20.10]Zoom.
[353:20.62]Ha ha ha.
[353:21.54]There's a bird and a tree?
[353:22.64]What the hell is all this?
[353:29.23]Brought to you by fruit.
[353:30.23]Wow.
[353:30.65]And then somebody does like a really detailed one down there.
[353:33.01]Haha, idiot.
[353:33.73]Nice zoom.
[353:36.90]What the fuck is this?
[353:40.36]Here, look, look, look.
[353:41.06]Here, here, here.
[353:41.92]Here, here, look, look!
[353:51.83]Virus.
[353:54.63]Nice zoom, idiot.
[353:56.85]What is this link?
[353:57.41]Is that a virus link?
[353:58.13]It's not a virus link.
[353:58.87]It's like a weird website.
[354:00.97]That is like a bad website.
[354:02.47]No, it's not.
[354:03.03]It's a fine website.
[354:04.42]Is it a good website?
[354:06.65]Where did you link me?
[354:07.19]You pre-screened it.
[354:08.05]You told me you pre-screened it!
[354:09.53]It was a pre-screened website.
[354:21.33]No, it works.
[354:25.69]It's not a picture, it's a website.
[354:26.93]It could be dynamic and change to a screamer at any time.
[354:32.11]I linked Flintstones porn.
[354:34.07]No, that did not happen.
[354:40.37]I think we broke the site.
[354:48.33]The site, we may have accidentally took it down.
[354:56.24]Yeah, that was so fucked up.
[354:58.72]Like, Barney was getting cooked or something.
[355:00.46]It was really fucking weird.
[355:02.32]It was horrifying.
[355:05.36]They were, like, eating each other.
[355:06.82]It was very, very, very graphic and horrible.
[355:15.47]I didn't even do that.
[355:16.97]I went to, I searched for something.
[355:19.21]Don't ever search for anybody.
[355:20.93]Ever.
[355:25.86]That actually, yeah, that did actually happen like a year ago.
[355:35.64]But thank you, Topec, for the website where you can draw whatever you want.
[355:40.95]Hey, Cougar, thanks for the $1.
[355:42.31]Hoorah.
[355:43.61]Hoorah.
[355:46.08]Oh, for the Marines.
[355:46.84]Okay, cool.
[355:48.50]Sweet, sweet.
[355:54.18]Don't tell us this shit.
[355:55.18]What the hell?
[355:55.64]What do you mean?
[355:59.12]The amount of new subs who missed the Flintstones porn has got to be quite high.
[356:02.57]Yeah.
[356:08.65]Probably.
[356:09.03]A lot of new people probably have no idea.
[356:14.96]There's been some weird shit on this stream.
[356:16.93]That's for sure.
[356:19.29]Hey, Smyder, thanks for the $1.
[356:21.65]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $2.50.
[356:22.79]Hey, Jeremy, I got a question about the new $2.50 limit.
[356:27.66]If I donate three 100-bit donations in a row, will they still be right at the end?
[356:31.56]No.
[356:33.30]It has to be $2.50.
[356:36.26]It's got to be, whatever the message is, it has to be in a $2.50 limit, and I'm reading $1.01 still, as you see.
[356:44.39]But I want it to slowly, over the last few streams, get, you know, transition slowly.
[356:56.55]But it's hard for me to buy exactly $250 here.
[357:00.93]Anyway, I thought you'd like to know there's a Groundhog Day VR game coming out later this year.
[357:04.26]Other than that, I'd recommend Payday VR, essentially built again for VR, and maybe L.A.
[357:09.94]Noire VR as you didn't finish the first time.
[357:14.77]Yeah, the VR case files looks fun.
[357:22.33]I'll probably end up doing that at some point soon.
[357:26.64]But, yes.
[357:28.58]The message, whatever you want to write, if you... Whatever the message is, that has to be at $2.50.
[357:40.27]VR needs to grow.
[357:41.39]Yes, it does.
[357:41.87]Are they going to solve some of the random issues that pop up from time to time?
[357:47.94]It's getting there, though.
[357:55.51]I give it like maybe another three to five years before they start to really get there.
[358:02.92]It's getting close.
[358:04.96]But thank you so much, Demonic Cucumber, for the $2.50.
[358:08.32]Ambix, thanks for the $2.50.
[358:09.60]Babe, don't make a sound.
[358:10.88]2 a.m.
[358:11.42]Love gotta keep it down.
[358:13.08]Don't wait around for a signal now.
[358:14.48]Give me some verbs.
[358:15.64]I ain't talking nouns.
[358:16.58]You wanna ride in the six?
[358:17.95]You wanna dive in the six when I lean for the kiss?
[358:21.03]He said I'd probably send you some bits.
[358:27.69]Thank you.
[358:28.68]Yes is online for the $4.
[358:30.64]This took 10 hours of my life.
[358:33.72]I hope you enjoy it.
[358:37.69]Oh, this is the birth... Yeah, we listened to this already.
[358:39.91]This is the Death Grips and Rats birthday mix.
[358:45.32]Didn't we already hear this?
[358:56.81]Yeah, I swear to God, we heard this before.
[358:59.33]I'm gonna change this to default negative turn.
[359:08.99]Hold on, I'm gonna change my desktop sound thing.
[359:12.04]There we go.
[359:24.83]Oh, that did not fix it.
[359:26.21]Why?
[359:26.73]Is that better?
[359:32.71]OK, here we go.
[359:40.70]Nice play, Jeff.
[359:51.35]I don't feel good.
[359:52.13]I can't.
[360:03.02]You have to put a gnome in here?
[360:05.08]Do you really have to do that?
[360:07.10]This was starting off so well.
[360:08.51]This is going very well.
[360:20.36]Is there anything else here?
[360:23.38]I'm something of a scientist myself.
[360:25.13]Oh!
[360:25.21]Oh!
[360:25.43]Oh!
[360:48.38]You guys are on the scenic route.
[361:00.23]Is that death?
[361:00.87]Yeah, it's death for a pushback.
[361:04.49]Bullshit.
[361:17.46]Link again, link it again.
[361:18.56]Here, here, here.
[361:25.26]There's the link.
[361:27.20]Well, that was the mashup between Death Grips, Rat's birthday song, and a gnome halfway through.
[361:36.00]Just in case you weren't paying attention.
[361:42.98]Thank you so much for that.
[361:45.03]I love how they kept the screaming in the background.
[361:50.45]Yeah, it looks like some work went into that.
[361:52.17]Thank you.
[361:56.13]Thank you YesesOnline for the $4 and that video.
[362:01.01]I'll talk to him.
[362:30.26]I'll find out what happened.
[362:35.78]He's acting out for some reason.
[362:37.16]I don't know why.
[362:37.64]I think he's in some kind of phase.
[362:46.79]Cheetah would never do that.
[362:47.73]I have to... I gotta confirm that story with Kim.
[362:50.79]It's important.
[362:53.17]But thank you, Sir Rock, for the $2.50.
[362:55.87]Thank you, Jess.
[362:56.59]You got it for the $2.50.
[362:58.80]I would love to see a stream in the middle of nowhere in Vegas, just you and a table of guns teaching gun safety.
[363:06.75]Well, that's definitely never going to happen because I do not necessarily know anything about how to handle a firearm.
[363:13.11]So I would never, ever operate one without the proper guidance and safety procedures.
[363:18.98]And I would never teach anybody anything about gun safety because there's no way I'd be able to tell you anything.
[363:25.00]I would have to step out of the way and have a professional go over safety.
[363:32.31]That's the point.
[363:33.15]Why would I ever do that?
[363:35.01]No, what?
[363:37.75]That's such a terrible, awful idea.
[363:44.93]You definitely seem like an expert after today's stream.
[363:47.01]Look at the dog.
[363:51.82]There's a little dog down there.
[363:56.21]But, yeah, there's some shit that I'm doing soon.
[364:01.80]If I can figure it out.
[364:03.26]I got plans.
[364:04.24]I got lots of plans for when it gets warm up.
[364:06.92]Just you wait.
[364:10.40]Thank you daring Ocelot for the two dollars.
[364:14.92]Only Jex would do the meat grinder.
[364:19.49]After I played for a couple hours, I really should have gone back and tried it.
[364:26.29]Because I figured out all the nuances of the game at that point.
[364:33.64]That's Shido.
[364:34.68]I think it actually might be Shido.
[364:35.82]That's weird.
[364:37.56]Maybe he is acting out.
[364:42.82]I'm learning how to bark, too.
[364:47.22]But thank you, Daring Ocelot, for the two bucks.
[364:50.22]Cypress74, thanks for the $10.
[364:51.26]Go to Sandbox and learn them.
[364:56.06]Yeah, I eventually figured it out.
[364:58.06]It was a fun learning experience.
[364:59.90]And I'm glad I didn't just skip that game, because... That... Sort of go and defend the point and go pick up stuff in the supply cases was actually very fun.
[365:14.05]So thank you, Cypress, for the $10 and for the tip.
[365:16.59]Thank you.
[365:18.90]Hey, Topac, thanks for the $2.50.
[365:21.76]Uh, how is my relation with, how's my relation with Northernlion?
[365:26.25]It's cool that his chat has a jupe command.
[365:28.79]Would love to see you guys do something together.
[365:30.39]Wait, what?
[365:33.93]Wait, Northernlion has a command for, like, jupe, like my emote?
[365:41.09]Is it for real?
[365:45.82]Or is it a different thing?
[365:53.08]Does he have his own Jupiter?
[366:03.65]Yeah, it blocks the Jupiter from being completed.
[366:06.19]Oh.
[366:13.34]I mean, I don't really... I don't talk to Nolan Lyon.
[366:16.36]I mean, he's just been around for a long time.
[366:20.20]I've never really had even a conversation with him, so I don't really... Okay.
[366:33.55]He's doing his thing.
[366:34.59]That's cool.
[366:36.23]Whatever.
[366:37.43]I don't really know him at all.
[366:46.50]But thank you for the $2.50.
[366:50.10]MJ Wodge, thanks for the $10.
[366:52.00]Hey, Jerma, keep on being an awesome streamer.
[366:55.30]I love you.
[366:55.92]Also, do you think we'll ever see you play Ace Attorney?
[366:59.00]I kind of want to see that.
[367:01.00]Also, should I buy Adrian a scooter?
[367:04.60]Well, the first part of that is Ace Attorney, when it comes to PC and gets remastered on PC, is when I'm going to try it.
[367:13.98]Got a lot of people's hopes up a few weeks ago when I said I was going to play it.
[367:17.52]But I got the version that I was told was not very good.
[367:20.73]And it's not the way you should experience the game.
[367:23.67]And I said, okay.
[367:24.87]I will hold off until the PC version is released.
[367:29.35]It's already out?
[367:32.33]Wait, the PC HD... Where is it?
[367:34.93]Is it on Steam?
[367:35.97]Steam?
[367:43.91]When did this come out?
[367:47.25]It had to have come out today, or the day before.
[367:52.23]Ace Attorney.
[367:56.65]Well, alright.
[367:59.54]Oh, it came out in Japan.
[368:03.68]Well, let me go take a look.
[368:12.62]See if I can figure out when it's coming out in North America.
[368:19.28]But thank you, MJ, for the $10.
[368:21.86]And should you buy Adrian a scooter?
[368:23.05]I'm not sure.
[368:23.47]What does Adrian... Does Adrian want a scooter?
[368:28.33]What is Adrian going to do with the scooter?
[368:31.51]Go ride around town?
[368:33.05]The neighborhood?
[368:34.13]Play along?
[368:34.69]Have some fun?
[368:37.55]Why are you responsible for buying Adrian a scooter?
[368:41.68]You know, I don't get much context.
[368:44.92]Adrian a friend of yours?
[368:45.96]Adrian a little brother?
[368:46.84]Adrian a significant other?
[368:48.56]I don't know.
[368:52.74]I'm going to say yeah.
[368:54.07]I mean, why not?
[368:58.91]But thank you for the $10.
[369:01.07]MostlyLost, thanks for the $1, MostlyLost.
[369:02.87]How do you only read the one guy every single time?
[369:06.39]It's honestly impressive.
[369:10.56]I don't know.
[369:11.82]Just the thing that pops up the most.
[369:14.05]It just pops out to me.
[369:16.17]The one guy.
[369:19.21]Thank you Cypress for the $10.
[369:20.53]They say more fun.
[369:23.14]I had a lot of fun.
[369:25.60]Thank you.
[369:28.58]For the $10 and more fun.
[369:32.46]Silverflame, thanks for the $2.50.
[369:33.70]Hey, Jerma, my pet duck, Oswald Cobbleduck, passed away recently, and it's been rough.
[369:40.51]Just want to say thank you for always being able to bring a smile to my face at my roughest moments.
[369:45.67]It's kind of corny, but honestly, in my darkest moments, you and your content has always been in the light in my life, reminding me to laugh.
[369:52.89]Hopefully one day I'll be able to repay you, but till then, take my ad bits, keep being you, Jerma, because that's the guy we all love.
[370:02.07]No, it's not.
[370:02.63]It's alright.
[370:03.07]It's not corny.
[370:05.59]It's alright.
[370:06.87]First of all, I'm really sorry to hear that.
[370:11.05]I've heard that ducks are incredibly intelligent, really, really loyal and loving animals.
[370:18.60]So, pet duck.
[370:22.68]Rest in peace to your duck.
[370:25.56]First of all.
[370:26.86]And second of all,
[370:29.67]I just, I just like to hang out here and have fun.
[370:32.83]You know?
[370:35.55]If that is what's happening and you are also having a good time and you're enjoying yourself by collectively hanging out here with a bunch of random people and me and all of us together making up this kind of crazy community then yeah, that's fucking incredible.
[370:50.78]It's amazing.
[370:51.30]I'm so happy that it happens.
[370:52.30]Because we're all just randomly in different places in the world
[370:58.29]And somehow we hang out here during these streams.
[371:03.56]So it's great.
[371:09.40]Much respect to you.
[371:11.26]Thank you, Silverflame.
[371:12.95]And again, sorry about your pet.
[371:14.31]Sorry about your duck.
[371:20.13]Thank you.
[371:22.41]Commando.
[371:22.95]Commando again.
[371:23.45]Commando Nam for $2.
[371:24.27]That green rocket launcher itself is an Easter egg to Half-Life 1.
[371:30.68]That's interesting stuff.
[371:34.80]It's pretty cool.
[371:37.98]Thank you for the little tidbit.
[371:40.15]Freudian Weapon, thanks for the $3.19.
[371:42.93]$3.19.
[371:42.97]They just said jermaHeart and jermaJex.
[371:46.49]I think I did okay.
[371:48.23]I did alright.
[371:50.87]We had a bunch of big sub... GIFs come in from Great Canadian Fuck Club.
[371:56.20]Mostly lost...
[371:58.53]You guys came in with 30, I believe, you know, 20 and then 10.
[372:02.79]Thank you, both of you.
[372:05.13]Smelly Boy.
[372:05.69]We had Smelly Boy for a dollar.
[372:06.95]War is hell.
[372:10.04]Yes, yes it is.
[372:13.10]Thank you, Flank Tank, for the $3.
[372:16.48]Quote, American doesn't know how to use guns.
[372:19.04]KKona.
[372:20.32]But really, Jerma, you live in the Wild West now, a.k.a.
[372:24.14]the desert.
[372:24.82]Take Kim and Etalyx to a shooting range and just try it out.
[372:27.68]It's kind of relaxing to shoot the shit, literally.
[372:30.42]I have been to a range before.
[372:34.20]I have shot a firearm before at a range a couple of years ago.
[372:47.30]I've shot a 9mm, a... Some type of submachine gun.
[372:53.48]Some type of rifle.
[372:54.80]And I was too afraid to shoot the shotgun.
[372:57.90]I was afraid.
[372:59.61]So I didn't do it.
[373:02.09]It was very scary.
[373:03.77]I didn't want to do it.
[373:09.85]It was a very powerful shotgun and I'm like, I don't know if I want to do that.
[373:17.28]Some guy in there shot this huge, huge sniper rifle.
[373:25.28]And actually, what they tell you is that everybody has to stop.
[373:29.77]So everybody just kind of hangs back and just waits.
[373:32.19]Because this giant, huge, high-caliber sniper rifle... You have ear protection on, first of all, right?
[373:38.37]Yeah.
[373:39.68]And this thing, you only get to shoot it one time at this place.
[373:44.04]And holy crap.
[373:46.84]When that thing is fired, you can feel it.
[373:50.74]Wind hits you in the face.
[373:53.08]And like your chest, you feel like a boom deep inside of your chest.
[373:57.11]It's wild.
[374:02.93]It definitely was an experience.
[374:07.16]There was a room with probably maybe 20, 30 people all at this range.
[374:11.23]And we all were just kind of sitting there like, wait for it, wait for it, here it comes.
[374:15.63]Boom!
[374:16.51]And the whole place just shakes.
[374:19.07]The .50 caliber pressure wave, yeah.
[374:26.38]No, it was interesting.
[374:30.88]Would I do it again?
[374:31.56]I don't know, maybe, yeah.
[374:34.09]I don't see like...
[374:36.61]As long as it was a safe place and it was, you know, they did things by the book and they had a lot of... the procedures were good, right?
[374:42.45]They usually are.
[374:53.14]My dad paid $10 for me to shoot one bullet out of a Barrett .50 caliber.
[374:56.88]Maybe that's what it was.
[374:57.92]There's a shotgun called a .410 that is fun.
[375:07.72]I don't know.
[375:11.89]I definitely wanted to experience it at least once.
[375:14.47]That was the idea.
[375:15.13]Use a varmint rifle.
[375:27.47]Nah, it was cool.
[375:28.67]It was cool, but also a little nerve-wracking, too, because you're just, like, somebody that I don't really handle guns or weapons ever.
[375:36.36]So when they, you know, it's like, okay, stand here, and you're like, yeah, okay.
[375:39.94]Hey, hold that, and it's, like, heavy, and you're like, okay, so, and over here, oh, oh, oh, just hold it up.
[375:45.16]Okay, but you're gonna be explaining everything, and you're listening, and you're paying attention, and you're sitting there going, like, I'm gonna fire this.
[375:50.96]I'm gonna fire this at the target, and what's gonna happen?
[376:01.62]It sounds stressful.
[376:03.51]The first, like, three or four shots at a range is pretty stressful.
[376:07.59]But once you... Because, look, if you've never done it before, you don't even know what to expect.
[376:14.87]It ain't like a fucking movie.
[376:15.95]You know what I mean?
[376:19.57]You gotta, like, control it.
[376:20.57]You gotta, like, be very, very attentive.
[376:22.55]You have to pay the fuck attention to everything you're doing.
[376:31.98]shaky hands.
[376:34.41]Very interesting stuff, though.
[376:39.43]Yeah, a tentative.
[376:44.95]Just hearing you talk about it is stressing me out.
[376:47.58]Well, I haven't really done it since.
[376:48.92]No, I did it once.
[376:51.88]That was about two and a half years ago.
[377:01.28]It was very different.
[377:02.54]But... There you go.
[377:05.06]Thank you, Flank Tank.
[377:09.60]Uh, DoorCube.
[377:10.22]Thanks for the $2.50, DoorCube.
[377:12.52]Not sure if you noticed, but you did something weird during that Horseshoes and Hot Dogs game.
[377:16.70]Take a look.
[377:19.00]Oh, did I?
[377:23.51]That's pretty good.
[377:24.47]Thank you for the... Thank you for the $2.50 and that image.
[377:28.63]Appreciate it.
[377:31.52]You did something weird.
[377:33.96]Uh, Sawfeather, thanks for the $1.78, Sawfeather.
[377:37.52]Thank you.
[377:38.49]FutureGamer, thanks for the $2.50.
[377:39.41]Uh, the dev added a super secret mode called Extreme Spin Mode, where your body angles to the ground so you stand on and spin you in the direction of the jets.
[377:51.44]I'm pretty good in VR and it almost made me projectile vomit.
[377:56.42]Yeah, I feel bad that that's kind of what we ended on.
[377:59.92]because somebody did say that more than a thousand people left the stream after 10-15 minutes of being in that game so actually it's probably better to end on that because we've been going for about four and a half hours anyways so probably better to end it than start on it that game is really cool though I'm gonna have I have to go back and play that one again
[378:30.53]Sometimes it was a little too much, but as long as you can kind of power through it, it was really, really, really fun.
[378:42.81]But thank you, FutureGamer with the $2.50.
[378:44.64]Thank you, Bingo Sunshine for the $5.
[378:48.34]Germany, if a VR game is making you sick, stop playing it.
[378:50.46]Don't keep making yourself sick for an hour plus.
[378:53.04]Laughing my ass off.
[378:57.22]No, it was fine.
[378:58.06]It was fun.
[379:00.83]Look, you guys know me pretty well at this point.
[379:05.46]If something is not okay with me on this stream, it goes off.
[379:10.68]Or it changes.
[379:13.50]Especially something like that.
[379:18.43]So, if I was really having a problem that I had to stop, I absolutely would have.
[379:24.53]So...
[379:29.08]Thank you for the concern though, I appreciate it.
[379:30.72]And thank you for the laughing my ass off at the end.
[379:34.80]If you do vomit, make sure to get it on camera.
[379:38.20]How long do you get banned for on Twitch if you puke on stream?
[379:42.41]Okay, hold on a second though.
[379:44.93]What if it's like not even my... That's not even my... No, I'm not drinking on stream or doing something fucked up.
[379:51.69]I just like got sick in VR and puked on stream.
[379:54.52]Would I get banned for like three days?
[380:02.46]No, like, on accident, not on purpose.
[380:09.95]I don't think it's... I mean, isn't it against... Isn't, like, bodily fluids against the terms of service?
[380:14.63]It has to be.
[380:19.17]You probably get 24 hours.
[380:22.70]Imagine that's, like, the way that my stream gets banned.
[380:27.72]This throwing up in VR.
[380:35.07]It would ruin this whole fucking room.
[380:37.67]Ayayay.
[380:40.85]24 hours.
[380:41.07]What the hell's with the internet right now?
[380:47.82]God damn it, I gotta make like another phone call and make sure this is getting fixed.
[380:52.28]But thank you, Bingo Sunshine, for the five bucks.
[380:53.84]Thank you, GreatLordWalden.
[380:55.16]How did I miss this?
[380:55.88]This is like 20 subs.
[380:59.22]From the gre- Oh, this is the one that I missed earlier.
[381:01.34]Yeah, GreatLordWalden, thank you so much for the 20 community subs.
[381:13.22]That was just barely an hour ago, thank you Oh man
[381:42.17]oh look at look at this good boy I'm really sorry to hear that here no remember all the wonderful things this this dog looks so just wonderful
[382:07.78]Thank you for sharing these pictures.
[382:10.28]And I'm really, really sorry to hear about that.
[382:12.25]And that happened today.
[382:14.49]Today?
[382:17.65]Yeah, I'm so sorry to hear that, Mo.
[382:25.18]What a good boy.
[382:28.94]And thank you for the $5.
[382:29.50]Much love to you.
[382:41.54]Yeah, it's always hard when you lose... When you lose, like, an animal, you lose, like, a really good friend.
[382:45.60]A really close friend.
[382:48.54]Family member, even, right?
[382:49.88]It's... They... Especially, like, dogs, cats, birds, doesn't matter.
[382:56.34]Talk about a significant portion of your whole life is spent with this animal.
[383:02.47]That when I had, uh, the last dog that I had was around for 17 years.
[383:06.95]17 years.
[383:10.90]It's a big deal.
[383:12.16]It's a lot to have to handle.
[383:16.72]And now Otto's around.
[383:17.64]He's been around for about five to seven, no, six years now.
[383:21.83]Just about.
[383:22.41]Seven, maybe.
[383:29.09]You know, everybody's going to have to do it eventually, right?
[383:31.95]Just enjoy the time you have with your animals.
[383:34.89]Love them.
[383:35.79]Every day.
[383:36.13]And just enjoy the time you have.
[383:39.03]Right?
[383:47.15]But thank you, Boo.
[383:48.65]Thank you, Bingo Sunshine, for $5.
[383:51.45]I'm sorry, Jerma.
[383:52.19]I was wrong.
[383:52.99]That was awesome.
[383:53.91]Good job sticking it out.
[383:58.71]Yeah, that started off really rocky.
[384:03.22]But as long as you just let it, you know, you let it just flow over you, you start to try to pay attention, you try to learn the moves, eventually there's a really, really, very, very, really, very fun game there.
[384:18.41]Thank you, Bingo.
[384:20.25]I'm sure we will return to it.
[384:22.91]Hey, Smelly Boy, thanks for the $1.
[384:24.29]I know you said no more VR, but you have to beat that Sky Worm.
[384:31.43]Thank you, Dr. Steen, for the five dollars.
[384:33.37]Pull the hair tuft.
[384:35.25]Embrace baldness.
[384:36.43]It'll be a good look for you.
[384:38.35]Smooth streamer.
[384:40.71]No, not yet.
[384:42.21]I don't have to do that yet.
[384:45.74]I don't have to go bald yet.
[384:47.26]I got plenty of hair up here.
[384:49.72]I can still style it.
[384:51.14]It still can swoosh.
[384:53.36]I can spray some stuff and put it back and it looks nice.
[384:55.62]I don't have to do that yet.
[384:58.16]Maybe like another five to ten years.
[385:03.96]No Omega LOL T yet.
[385:06.12]Oh, God.
[385:13.89]We had 10 community subs coming from Asha.
[385:18.49]Asha108, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[385:22.05]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[385:26.24]No BTTV.
[385:27.66]Nope.
[385:29.92]5 to 10 days is more accurate.
[385:31.06]We'll see.
[385:33.91]Thank you, Asher.
[385:34.45]And thank you, Dr. Steen, for the suggestion, but I'm not pulling out my hair.
[385:40.87]Um, Mr. Oh, Me Double J. Thanks for the five dollars, Me Double J. Dreamer, would you say that VR was worth it?
[385:47.32]Also, so far, what's your favorite VR game?
[385:49.56]Super Hot VR is not only my favorite VR game, it's one of my favorite games I think I've played over the last couple of years.
[385:56.82]Now, here's the thing about VR that's a little strange.
[386:00.29]And I get it.
[386:01.83]It seems like there are
[386:05.53]It seems like all these VR games are kind of like two to three hour experiences, and they're all between $15 and $25.
[386:16.54]If SUPERHOT VR was a $60 game and was like another three or four, maybe five hours of content, maybe like another three hours of content, even if it was a five hour, like four to five hour VR experience.
[386:29.57]I think I would be worth it.
[386:31.08]But nobody's like making full-on complete VR games because probably that market share just isn't there.
[386:41.01]And maybe people can only play them for so long, right?
[386:45.39]But man, if I could pay $60 for two and a half times the content that was in SUPERHOT VR, that'd be one of my probably favorite games ever made.
[386:53.82]I'm not kidding around.
[386:54.86]That's not a joke.
[386:56.78]You know, like, Ocarina of Time!
[386:58.24]No, no, no.
[386:58.66]Bump it off the list.
[386:59.56]See you later.
[387:01.46]You add like two to three more hours of actual campaign content in SUPERHOT VR, make it like a $40 to $50, $60 game, that's one of my favorite games ever made.
[387:13.76]Market share is a big word for you?
[387:15.40]I used to trade cryptocurrency.
[387:17.40]You don't think I know what that word means?
[387:33.51]He finally admitted it.
[387:34.73]What?
[387:35.03]You guys know that.
[387:35.91]I have an emote that is a coin.
[387:39.59]that was that why is it sometimes not quit talking about cryptocurrency somebody just said it but the thing is before I wasn't okay we're gonna move on because I wasn't talking about it before and somebody accused me of talking about it before I don't talk about it anymore it's a goddamn bear market and I'm not going to talk about that in a bear market oh he knows what that word is that means that instead of uh it's a it's bull and bear
[388:08.85]Now, how that works is in Wall Street, instead of humans, there are bears in suits that go in there.
[388:15.49]They're all dressed up and they trade for a little while.
[388:17.66]That's like a bear market.
[388:18.62]They're allowed to be in there for a few months.
[388:20.72]And then they let the bears out when they're done.
[388:22.94]Because they have to hibernate.
[388:24.18]And then the bulls come in and then they put on suits and shit.
[388:26.82]And it's animals.
[388:33.04]No, bull is up, bear is down.
[388:34.40]You don't think I know this stuff?
[388:41.87]You wanna know what market cap means?
[388:43.71]I'll give you a whole course.
[388:45.60]Stay after the credits.
[388:54.62]That sounds like a furry party.
[388:56.44]I'm gonna laugh my ass off, okay.
[389:05.72]Okay, if I said that I was gonna do a financial course after the credits, and then I was gonna explain market cap after the credits were over... I wonder how many people leave.
[389:15.33]I'm not a financial advisor, when did I say that?
[389:18.53]Never said that.
[389:21.29]But yes, uh... Back to- I don't know how that even got there, but... VR... is great.
[389:29.92]It's definitely worth it.
[389:31.12]SuperhotVR... was... unbelievably good.
[389:36.84]To a point where I'm angry about it.
[389:38.76]I am UPSET.
[389:41.06]That SUPERHOT VR is something that I can't play anymore because I mean I could go back and like beat all the levels and try to get really good at them.
[389:47.67]Do the speedrun stuff.
[389:50.51]But I beat it in about an hour and 32 minutes.
[389:54.45]And it was one of my favorite things I've done in the last couple years.
[389:57.83]Take that how you will.
[390:02.47]E-Dragon, thanks for the three bucks, E-Dragon.
[390:04.67]Hey Jerma, great stream.
[390:05.55]I showed you to my drunk friend and he thinks you're hilarious.
[390:10.15]Uh, hello drunk friend.
[390:12.45]Happy to have you aboard.
[390:14.61]Thanks for the three bucks, E-Dragon, and thanks for introducing me to one of your friends.
[390:23.00]Thank you.
[390:24.62]Oh, I got somebody, I gotta, uh, end an argument here.
[390:27.62]Uh, Jess, you got it, 250.
[390:28.68]Thanks for the 250.
[390:29.91]We're having an argument in the Discord.
[390:31.83]Prove a point for us and say these words, okay?
[390:34.89]Arkansas, crayon, bologna, caramel, tomato.
[390:39.97]Done.
[390:47.63]What do I win?
[390:58.46]He pronounced it W-R-O-M-E-G-A-L-L wrong.
[391:02.50]What is the word Omega Lull in the middle of a word?
[391:08.38]Where an O is.
[391:18.75]Omega Lull.
[391:22.91]This is a super laugh right?
[391:24.29]That means you're having a lot of fun.
[391:34.33]What the heck is Omegalon?
[391:38.75]No, I know what that is.
[391:39.77]That's the big... The big mouth being open, right?
[391:44.27]It's a huge... That means I'm... That means I'm laughing so hard that I'm like turning... I can't even... I can't even comprehend it anymore.
[391:52.62]I'm laughing so hard, right?
[391:55.14]Can I get a crash... Okay, after the stream, you guys can give me a crash course in... I don't know what some of these emotes mean.
[392:01.32]What do they actually mean?
[392:04.37]So, L-U-L is, I just laughed, that was funny.
[392:08.92]Omega lull is, I'm laughing so hard that it hurts and I have to stop laughing.
[392:14.90]Is that correct?
[392:15.36]Okay, good.
[392:24.13]So, Kappa means, get over it, loser, right?
[392:26.85]No, no, no, not Kappa.
[392:29.71]Forehead.
[392:30.77]Forehead is like, okay, get over it, not funny, right?
[392:41.70]That's correct, isn't it?
[392:44.56]Like, forehead is like, oh, look at how you're laughing so hard.
[392:47.65]Like, I'm laughing.
[392:48.35]Like, get over it.
[392:48.97]It's not funny.
[392:51.23]It's like a sarcastic one.
[392:58.56]Okay.
[393:02.28]And then, haha is...
[393:06.49]I- I respect this person so much, and I think that they're really awesome, so I want them to show- I want to show them a close-up of my face.
[393:15.04]Right?
[393:18.48]Like, I'm gonna take a selfie of my face, like, smiling, to show them how much fun I'm having.
[393:22.70]That's what I thought.
[393:32.80]It means cringe.
[393:35.48]cringe I've never heard that I've never seen that sequence of letters before in a row I don't know is it a different language I'm not sure whatever that means hey toshiro dot TV thanks for the five dollars
[393:58.40]Jet Island looks absolutely bonkers to play.
[394:00.37]I hope to eventually get a VR setup.
[394:03.05]On an unrelated note, I was wondering what your policy is on fan meetups.
[394:06.51]I'm actually going to be in Vegas this weekend with my dad for my 21st birthday.
[394:10.39]Happy 21st birthday.
[394:12.12]I was hoping to meet up at some point, but since you're streaming all weekend, then I won't worry about it much.
[394:16.54]Hope I have as much fun in Vegas as you do in VR.
[394:19.38]Well, I can tell you right now,
[394:21.16]I don't do them.
[394:22.56]I don't do fan meetups.
[394:24.81]I don't do meet and greets.
[394:26.77]Unless, very specifically, they are on a convention floor.
[394:32.25]Like a TwitchCon, a PAX East, a PAX West, E3.
[394:37.51]I don't do meetups.
[394:41.37]I mean, I guess there's like probably a handful of reasons why.
[394:43.61]So remember, just let us in your house.
[394:55.90]He can't get the pass to conventions.
[394:57.94]What?
[395:01.62]But no, I don't... I like to kind of... Here's... Let me give you the long and short of it here.
[395:08.62]So, let's say that you and I hung out tomorrow, right?
[395:15.02]Alright, I'm coming down.
[395:16.02]I'll see you in a minute.
[395:16.64]Let's hang out and let's play roulette.
[395:18.70]You know, whatever you would be doing.
[395:20.18]Let's go to dinner.
[395:22.93]essentially what I'm doing is I'm like, I'm opening myself up to a stranger, you know what I mean?
[395:31.68]It's not like I don't, not like you're a stranger stranger, you've been on the stream, you write text, I see you in chat, but I don't personally like to kind of open myself up to somebody that I don't know in real life, unless it was at a place that I was comfortable going to, like a convention where we're all there for the same reason anyways.
[395:56.83]And that's nothing against anybody that ever wants to say hello.
[396:00.37]There's been plenty of people that have just, you know, happened to see me on the street.
[396:05.98]Even here, like it's happened.
[396:07.70]It's happened like at least twice in Vegas.
[396:11.02]And that's great.
[396:11.52]That's fine.
[396:12.18]That's fine.
[396:12.66]But like specifically planning to go like hang out with somebody is something I will never do.
[396:17.68]It just, it's never going to happen.
[396:20.41]So maybe that can be like a blanket statement, I think.
[396:30.49]but if we're at a convention or you happen to see me on the street or you happen to just know that I'm here and you ran into me somehow I was at like some place on the strip or in downtown or wherever that do not take this as a leave me the fuck alone no it's just specific hangouts there's something I will never do
[397:00.81]Hey, you want to hang out at Chili's?
[397:02.07]I just want to hang out at your house and eat pizza rolls.
[397:13.76]No, because, I mean, I... Look.
[397:15.12]I do have to be on top of that, because...
[397:22.19]You know, you just never know.
[397:23.09]You never know what somebody's intentions are, what they want out of that.
[397:28.15]You know, if somebody has then like, oh, maybe like, maybe I have your phone number now.
[397:32.15]I got your phone number.
[397:34.31]It just gets, I don't want it to ever get to that place.
[397:39.83]But we'll move on from it.
[397:41.13]Just know that if you don't see me at a convention, I do meetups pretty much at any convention I ever go to.
[397:47.81]But that's where I'm going to leave it.
[397:54.32]No, I haven't.
[397:55.08]Hey, Flying Sombrero, thanks for the three bucks.
[397:58.36]Hey, Jerma.
[397:58.92]Oh, wait, wait, hold on.
[398:00.28]Toshiro, happy birthday.
[398:02.82]Happy 21st birthday.
[398:04.40]You gotta love Las Vegas.
[398:05.30]It's amazing.
[398:06.76]As long as you do it responsibly, you're gonna love it.
[398:11.31]Flying Cerbera, thanks for the three bucks.
[398:13.49]Hey, Jeremiah, I turned 21.
[398:14.13]What are 21s?
[398:14.89]I turned 21 last week, and me and my friend got drunk to your most recent rumble.
[398:19.75]I had to drunkenly explain who Bugleberry was to the other normies in the dorm, but it was one of the best nights of my life.
[398:26.98]Thanks for being a great role model as I've been growing up.
[398:29.70]You mean a lot to us.
[398:30.52]Who the fuck is Bugleberry?
[398:34.64]I had to explain to these normies in my dorm room.
[398:39.66]I can imagine how that explanation came up.
[398:48.85]Dormies!
[398:54.97]That's so funny.
[398:56.91]Why would you show anyone Jerma Rumble as their first Jerma video?
[399:01.20]I like those videos.
[399:13.32]I'm just like, I'm living that scenario in my head.
[399:16.62]Bunch of people around a couch.
[399:18.87]People don't know who it is.
[399:19.75]You're desperately, drunkenly trying to explain that this is a... He puts on a mask and like pretends to be this like R.L.
[399:28.27]Stine fucking creepy guy.
[399:30.99]And like nobody thinks it's funny.
[399:33.17]But he still does it all the time anyways because he thinks it's funny.
[399:38.56]That's a long explanation.
[399:46.03]Mask?
[399:52.33]Not like he puts on a mask.
[399:54.27]I'm talking about a social mask.
[399:57.05]You know, he has to- he's not himself.
[400:00.23]He's just a regular guy and he has to put on the mask and be in front of camera.
[400:06.82]What did you guys think I was talking about?
[400:13.74]Why would you do that?
[400:14.40]But it was totally worth it.
[400:15.14]No, it wasn't.
[400:15.48]You got detention for no reason.
[400:16.24]No, that's not a good thing.
[400:17.22]It was worth it.
[400:40.15]All you got out of that was a bunch of people around you were like, this guy's screaming.
[400:45.32]And then you went to school jail.
[400:55.77]Yeah, somebody just said it.
[400:56.57]Everyone's talking about like, oh, what a good role model.
[401:00.68]That's not the description of somebody that has a... Whoa, yeah, that's a... Who... Where did you get that from?
[401:06.85]Um, you know, my role model.
[401:09.69]Who's your role model?
[401:10.53]That's this guy, Jerma.
[401:11.55]He, like, sucks.
[401:12.49]He's fucked up.
[401:13.17]He, like, screams.
[401:14.87]He says, like, a bunch of fucking crazy shit.
[401:17.99]Oh, really?
[401:18.97]Then I'm gonna get banned from your school.
[401:27.74]They won't... You won't be able to wear, like, the t-shirts anymore.
[401:32.38]My Jerma boomer, jermaOld emote phone case that's coming out next week.
[401:37.26]You won't be able to have that on anymore.
[401:38.68]You have to take it off.
[401:39.38]Put a new phone case on.
[401:52.37]Leaked?
[401:53.15]I'm just making that up.
[401:56.74]That might just appear on the store.
[401:58.70]Next week.
[402:01.08]Just because I said it here.
[402:03.55]If more than 10 people buy that, I think that would be funny.
[402:10.82]Well, what is Teespring gonna think?
[402:14.94]You know, it's gonna be human skin as your phone case.
[402:21.94]Yeah, I can hear you.
[402:22.92]There's that guy again.
[402:26.47]Remember he donated last time?
[402:30.15]Oh, she's gonna show up again.
[402:34.24]That was me.
[402:41.93]But anyways.
[402:43.81]Thank you Toshiro again for the $5, Toshiro.TV.
[402:47.93]It's me again.
[402:49.39]I got to dip up for the conclusion, but just want to know that regardless of the answer to my question,
[402:53.73]I know that you are appreciated and that I'm looking forward to watching more streams and VODs.
[402:58.13]My life is taking a different direction as of late, and you've been an important pillar of my life and interests.
[403:04.07]Here's to a good future for you, Etalyx, Kim, and all of us in the chat.
[403:08.13]Absolutely, thank you.
[403:10.20]It's a very, very nice thing to say.
[403:12.24]Hopefully the direction you're taking is the correct one.
[403:16.36]Hopefully you got a good choice there.
[403:20.58]Life is weird.
[403:21.62]Sometimes you get thrown a curveball.
[403:24.02]You go in a different direction.
[403:24.86]Sometimes the car turns around.
[403:26.44]You go on the road you just came down.
[403:28.90]And you go back like four exits and get off that highway.
[403:33.73]Whatever is best for you.
[403:36.51]Thank you again for the $5.
[403:37.57]And I wish you the best of luck.
[403:39.01]Good luck on whatever route life is taking you.
[403:45.11]Just do your best.
[403:46.47]It's all you can do.
[403:48.50]Tingy, thanks for the $2.49.
[403:49.20]Sorry that I'm a bit short on the minimum.
[403:52.30]I don't have enough Jerm of Pluto.
[403:56.96]I'm sorry, but still get red.
[404:04.42]Hey, Nate, thanks for the two bucks, Nate.
[404:07.10]Am I going to play Black Mesa Zen soon?
[404:10.02]It's the biggest thing to ever happen in the Half-Life community.
[404:13.22]Probably not.
[404:15.13]I hate to crush your dreams here, but I don't think I'm gonna play that.
[404:23.94]Sorry.
[404:25.24]Oof.
[404:26.81]I just, I don't think I'll play it.
[404:29.19]Not sure.
[404:30.29]Probably not.
[404:32.99]Play Tilt Brush?
[404:35.84]Yeah, there's so many things to do.
[404:37.32]It sucks because I have this finite amount of time in VR where I know I'm only going to be able to do it for four to five hours straight.
[404:47.17]There's so many pieces of content that I need to stuff in there and then come up for air and do it again another time.
[404:56.20]I wish it didn't kill me, but it does.
[404:58.76]But I love it.
[405:08.10]Plays GeoGuessr and shitty Flash games, won't play Black Mesa.
[405:13.48]Yeah, but I'm not interested in Black Mesa.
[405:18.89]I was interested in GeoGuessr.
[405:20.19]I mean, remember, I'm only gonna do things that I know I'm gonna be interested in doing.
[405:25.47]I don't have a current interest in Black Mesa, really at all.
[405:30.07]So all I would be doing was just forcing myself to pretend to be interested in Black Mesa.
[405:37.68]To stream it.
[405:39.14]You know what I'm saying?
[405:39.86]Like, that doesn't click with me.
[405:41.92]Doesn't click with me.
[405:46.56]That's just the truth, and I'm going to be truthful.
[405:58.49]Google Earth VR is an amazing experience, by the way.
[406:01.87]Even if you don't stream it, I highly suggest you take your own time to look at it.
[406:08.51]Yeah, that was a big request too.
[406:13.94]But I mean, that's not to say I don't like Half-Life.
[406:16.40]I think it just... I highly, highly respect the Black Mesa stuff, the Half-Life stuff, the Half-Life offshoots.
[406:27.06]Wonderful things.
[406:28.48]Great things.
[406:29.47]Just not something that I'm interested in.
[406:32.95]I can respect it.
[406:33.57]You know what I'm saying?
[406:38.98]That was... Yes, I just did like an otter clap.
[406:42.64]That's a backpedal?
[406:43.40]That's not a backpedal.
[406:44.20]I'm not interested in any Black Mesa-related material.
[406:56.02]Otters are cute?
[406:56.62]Yes, they are.
[407:01.40]LOL, it's like he thinks he's the streamer.
[407:09.23]Alright, you go.
[407:09.91]It's your turn.
[407:11.05]Go on.
[407:11.65]Get up here.
[407:13.61]Let's go.
[407:13.96]I'll be back in like 10 minutes.
[407:23.48]But thank you, Precision Weed, for the $5.
[407:24.98]Hey, Jerma, really enjoying the streams.
[407:26.62]Give up the good work.
[407:27.22]I will try.
[407:28.78]Thank you.
[407:32.29]Thank you for the $5, and thanks for the amazing, kind thing that you just said.
[407:37.79]Thank you.
[407:40.27]Thank you, ShinoDage, for the $2.50.
[407:42.35]Hey, Jerma, is the Gamer Challenge with Joel still happening?
[407:46.53]We need to know.
[407:47.07]We need to figure out a good game to do it.
[407:49.92]I already vetoed.
[407:51.46]Uh... Grounds... Why do I think the name of that game is Grounds for Divorce?
[408:05.48]Grounds for Divorce?
[408:06.04]What is it called?
[408:08.26]Getting Over It.
[408:12.39]What?
[408:12.83]Where did that come from?
[408:17.07]Getting over it.
[408:17.97]I vetoed that.
[408:24.36]Because if... He already has a ton of time in it and it's not fair.
[408:28.62]We have to both go in blind to a highly skilled video game that neither one of us have played.
[408:39.86]And we'll be good to go.
[408:40.52]I'm just going to figure out which one that is.
[408:44.25]What's the punishment for the loser?
[408:47.31]The person that loses has to take one sip of beer.
[408:53.11]And I'm talking a Bud Light.
[408:55.55]Like the lightest pee beer you can drink.
[409:02.49]People probably like that drink.
[409:03.49]I'm sorry.
[409:07.20]I know people probably... Somebody's probably drinking that right now.
[409:10.32]And I just like... I didn't mean to make fun of you.
[409:12.24]I wasn't making fun of you.
[409:14.76]Bud Light is fine.
[409:17.74]It's just gross.
[409:19.90]And no human should ever consume it.
[409:22.68]In fact, I would not be upset at all if they dumped it all.
[409:35.05]No, Bud Light is fine.
[409:36.95]It's a cold beer.
[409:44.32]Twitch is gonna ban you.
[409:46.46]Just drink water.
[409:51.18]No, I'm not gonna be one of those beer elitists and tell you elitists.
[409:56.21]That's a really weird word to say.
[409:59.23]Elitists.
[410:00.99]There's two it's in that word.
[410:04.28]I'm not gonna be a beer elitist.
[410:07.77]Not one of those people that says, why are you drinking Bud Light, you idiot?
[410:14.15]No, if you like, drink what you like.
[410:16.25]Do what you like.
[410:17.63]Drink what you like.
[410:18.33]Don't let somebody tell you that you can't drink a Bud Light because they don't think it's cool.
[410:23.45]Who gives a shit?
[410:27.63]What is that guy drinking?
[410:30.55]Well, I have a gin and tonic.
[410:31.79]Disgusting.
[410:32.85]He's even worse.
[410:43.49]Anyways.
[410:47.51]PBR?
[410:48.65]People don't like PBR.
[410:52.00]People drink PBR.
[410:53.12]It's like, oh yeah, people drink PBR, in my opinion.
[410:55.74]Yeah, but this is all my opinion, right?
[410:57.80]This is somebody that drinks PBR, right?
[410:59.34]So forget about the hair.
[411:00.24]Pretend I don't look this bad.
[411:01.98]So imagine this is full of PBR.
[411:03.32]You know, people, yeah, PBR, man.
[411:05.53]I love PBR.
[411:06.73]It's so awesome.
[411:07.51]You got PBR here?
[411:08.75]Oh, you got it on tap.
[411:09.63]Yeah, thanks, man.
[411:10.27]Yeah.
[411:12.53]Yeah, PBR.
[411:15.75]Yeah, I drink PBR.
[411:16.77]It's fucking good.
[411:17.73]You know, I like it.
[411:18.33]It's, like, cool and, like, indie.
[411:21.95]Yeah, man, like, you going to the bathroom?
[411:24.04]Nice, man.
[411:25.70]And they dump it in a fucking sink.
[411:27.34]And then they, like, go, like, that's wicked quick.
[411:28.62]And it comes back and, like, the person comes back.
[411:31.26]Mmm.
[411:34.74]PBR, man.
[411:35.44]Yeah.
[411:35.62]You want another PBR?
[411:36.84]The guy comes back.
[411:37.46]Hey, you want another PBR, dude?
[411:39.95]Yeah.
[411:40.91]Give me that.
[411:41.35]Give me two.
[411:41.97]You know what I mean?
[411:42.47]Because I fucking love it so much.
[411:45.18]And they go and they get you two.
[411:46.94]And you have to pretend to like it.
[412:03.55]PBR is fine.
[412:05.67]It's not a big deal if you drink PBR.
[412:08.07]If you drink Bud Light, you drink PBR, you drink gin and tonic, you drink, uh, you drink, like, vodka tonic, which, don't ask me why, I don't know why anybody would put tonic in a drink.
[412:18.62]Tonic just, it just tastes like throw-up.
[412:21.24]It doesn't even, the flavor, the quinine's flavor is disgusting.
[412:25.92]It's just adding gross water to your drink.
[412:28.52]If you're gonna do, like, a vodka tonic, just do a vodka soda with a lime.
[412:31.12]Why do you put tonic in there?
[412:33.52]It tastes like stomach acid.
[412:35.50]What does tonic do?
[412:37.02]But make the drink grosser.
[412:38.96]Alright, if you like vodka tonic, if you like gin and tonic, if you like PBR, if you like Bud Light, anything that you like to drink, just drink it and like it.
[412:53.92]And don't worry what some asshole like me says.
[412:57.40]You know, making fun of the fact that I don't think PBR tastes very good.
[413:05.05]What you should be drinking, what you should be drinking is Gray Goose on ice with a splash of soda and a splash of ginger ale and a lime.
[413:15.99]That's what you should be drinking.
[413:17.13]Alright, let's move on.
[413:26.71]If you're old enough to drink.
[413:35.23]You know what wine I've been... Hold on a second.
[413:37.12]Let me go on cam for this.
[413:39.48]No.
[413:39.76]Why would I do that?
[413:42.70]You know, I had... This is going to be very elitist and I can already smell... I can smell it in the chat already.
[413:48.56]I had a Malbec.
[413:51.38]The other day.
[413:53.08]It was great.
[413:54.48]Malbec.
[413:55.90]Malbec.
[413:57.64]It was fucking fantastic.
[413:59.31]One of the best wines I've ever had.
[414:01.81]It's an Argentinian wine.
[414:02.99]It's fantastic.
[414:04.27]Malbec.
[414:07.97]You looking for a new red to drink?
[414:10.99]That's what I'm looking for.
[414:15.49]The elitist.
[414:20.45]Oh, look at me!
[414:20.93]I got my PBR on tap!
[414:23.72]Excuse me.
[414:25.06]Excuse me.
[414:26.14]Do you guys have PBR on tap?
[414:33.62]Look at me, you know?
[414:39.71]Yeah, oh yeah, sure.
[414:41.35]Yeah, we sure do.
[414:42.01]We got PBR on tap.
[414:43.27]Just hand tight.
[414:44.39]Yeah, it's called he goes to the fucking bathroom.
[414:46.45]He goes to the toilet and like dunks you a glass in it and puts it on the table.
[414:52.07]There's your PBR on tap.
[414:57.83]Why'd you go in the back room to do that?
[415:00.07]Actually, we got a special keg back there.
[415:09.59]Oh, it's in the bathroom.
[415:11.33]You just went into the men's bathroom.
[415:13.05]Yeah.
[415:14.57]Oh.
[415:15.93]Yep.
[415:17.91]Okay.
[415:20.35]That'll be three dollars.
[415:30.89]Where the fuck was I on bits?
[415:31.97]I don't even remember.
[415:34.11]No, all jokes aside, drink what you like.
[415:37.57]Like what you drink.
[415:39.09]And don't listen to anybody.
[415:40.65]The whole point of this whole conversation was you should have been rolling your eyes the whole time.
[415:44.83]At everything I was just saying.
[415:46.92]While you have your 32-ounce Gatorade bottle of PBR.
[415:57.46]Thank you, MultiTrip, for the $2.50.
[416:03.31]I'm glad you didn't quit.
[416:05.49]Uh... H3VR after spending two hours solving puzzles and fucking around in a dev room, you boomer.
[416:15.27]What do you mean a dev room?
[416:24.80]What was a dev room?
[416:28.92]It was the test room with the swords.
[416:35.59]Oh, that's so ridiculous.
[416:39.37]I don't know these things.
[416:41.58]I just like clicked on them.
[416:42.64]People told me to click on it.
[416:52.12]Dev room.
[416:53.43]Thank you, MoldyTrip for the 250.
[416:54.75]That just like brought my voice.
[416:56.39]That killed my voice.
[416:57.33]It was already shot before.
[416:59.50]Thank you, Dorkcube, for the 2 to 50.
[417:01.38]Seeing your violent reaction to slamming into virtual walls reminds me when people first saw a motion picture and thought they were really a train heading towards them.
[417:11.74]You have no idea.
[417:13.22]It is that experience.
[417:16.83]That is exactly how I could describe that.
[417:22.83]This is our version of the old-timey train is coming and people screaming in the movie theater.
[417:33.09]Thank you, DoorQ.
[417:35.67]Uh, thank you Great Canadian Fuck Club for the five dollars and the huge amount of community subs.
[417:40.38]Hey Jerma, what do you call a fish with no eyes?
[417:45.26]I don't know, but you gave five more dollars right after that.
[417:48.84]And it's... I don't understand.
[417:54.35]Oh, there's no eye.
[417:55.73]There's no eye.
[417:56.19]It's just F-H.
[417:57.29]F-S-H-H-H-H-H.
[418:01.09]What's the best Peter Griffin impression?
[418:02.23]You got it.
[418:03.53]Nope.
[418:04.85]I'm not even going to let that go far enough for anyone to even cap it and clip it and embarrass me.
[418:10.62]Thank you, GreatCanadianThough, for the $10 total.
[418:14.32]Commando, thanks for the $2.51.
[418:15.16]$2.51.
[418:15.18]How savage am I, chat?
[418:28.17]Thank you, Nate, for the $2.
[418:29.11]Hey, Jerma, so I found out there's one last Blockbuster video in the entire world.
[418:35.01]And it's in Alaska.
[418:37.81]You should go to your extinct store and make a video.
[418:44.54]In Alaska.
[418:47.50]Bring my pamphlet that says that I'm a gamer.
[418:51.77]That one closed.
[418:53.27]Well, looks like they're all closed.
[418:57.46]Looks like they're all closed.
[418:58.54]Do you hear that?
[419:01.20]Looks like they're all closed.
[419:02.70]Closed.
[419:04.67]I'm doing the weird old person teeth whistle thing.
[419:10.39]The one in Oregon is still open.
[419:12.13]Interesting.
[419:15.11]The pamphlet was fake?
[419:15.93]No, it wasn't.
[419:16.58]It was real.
[419:18.70]Hey, Juno!
[419:19.32]Thanks for the $3, Juno.
[419:20.64]Okay, Jerma.
[419:21.18]Clear it up once again.
[419:22.66]It's jupe as in jupe, not jupe, right?
[419:25.46]Yes.
[419:27.19]I don't know how many times I have to explain this.
[419:29.71]It is, the planet's name is Jupiter.
[419:34.09]It's not Juppiter.
[419:35.89]It's not the planet Juppiter.
[419:37.83]It's Jupiter.
[419:39.25]Jupiter.
[419:40.05]Jupiter.
[419:41.97]Jupe.
[419:44.11]Not Jup.
[419:44.97]Jupe.
[419:45.61]Jupiter.
[419:47.75]You find somebody that calls it Juppiter, and I will tell you they can use it and say Jup however much they want.
[420:03.64]Civil War averted.
[420:06.54]And then I started a new one.
[420:08.62]By talking shit about Bud Light, PBR, gin and tonic, vodka tonic.
[420:14.95]You know what?
[420:15.25]Fuck it.
[420:15.51]Let's just... Let's do the whole... Let's go around the horn.
[420:21.87]What other, like, alcohols are gross?
[420:25.38]Oh, heavy beers, too.
[420:26.62]Like, you're drinking liquid bread.
[420:28.72]What's wrong with you?
[420:33.60]I'm gonna blend up a loaf of wheat bread and put some water in it.
[420:37.70]And then you can sip on it and like swallow it hard.
[420:40.18]Because it's like, it takes like four or five seconds to go down your throat.
[420:43.09]No, no, no.
[420:51.19]Okay, hold on a minute.
[420:52.19]I have to be careful here.
[420:53.99]I'm gonna be very careful.
[420:56.55]Because... Saying like heavy beer is bad...
[421:02.45]Is, like, that's grounds for divorce.
[421:07.77]Because that's real beer, right?
[421:09.51]That's the real ale.
[421:21.46]Now, my brother likes stuff like Guinness.
[421:26.44]We were with a bunch of his friends, and it was the first time we all hung out after 21.
[421:32.90]And, you know, they're all drinking, we're all having a fun time, we're at a bar, and they're all drinking these big, heavy, heavy, like, dark brews, you know what I mean?
[421:42.16]Big, heavy beers.
[421:43.70]And he wanted me to try it.
[421:45.28]And, you know, all his friends are, like, super into beer.
[421:48.00]And I embarrassed him like crazy because I took one sip and, like, coughed as if I'd just taken a hit from a cigarette.
[421:56.29]And I was like, oh, disgusting!
[422:00.85]And all of his friends just staring at him.
[422:03.00]Like, who is this motherfucker that you brought here?
[422:06.10]By the way, that story is not real.
[422:07.38]I made the whole thing up.
[422:08.28]Sorry.
[422:08.54]Because I'm a liar.
[422:10.70]Uh, Garvey the Monday Killer, thank you for the one dollar.
[422:14.82]Uh... Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro.
[422:20.57]You caught me singing.
[422:22.53]I actually saw a nice dog today.
[422:24.73]It was really small and I got to give it tons of pets.
[422:26.93]Sounds pretty nice, huh?
[422:29.24]The little dude reminded me of Otto.
[422:31.25]Odo gave it a pet too.
[422:33.15]Odo.
[422:34.07]Odie.
[422:34.87]Anyway, Jerm, keep up the great work and don't stop garping around because you're having a garf time.
[422:38.39]Having a garf time.
[422:40.69]Thank you, Garfield.
[422:44.04]Appreciate it.
[422:45.28]Glad you saw a good little dog today.
[422:48.76]Commando, thanks for the $2.50.
[422:50.16]Here's the Black Mesa trailer.
[422:52.14]Please watch it.
[422:53.82]I don't have to do anything.
[422:57.27]I don't have to do anything.
[423:17.33]This is VR?
[423:22.29]This is a VR game?
[423:25.89]Alright, fuck yeah.
[423:26.95]They made a VR game.
[423:27.91]What do you mean no?
[423:35.44]That's impossible.
[423:37.74]No, no, no.
[423:38.02]I'm sorry.
[423:38.40]Hold on a minute here.
[423:40.32]I want top 10 facts about Half-Life.
[423:44.04]How did I just...
[423:47.16]I have Easter eggs?
[423:48.20]How did I get here?
[423:53.20]What happened?
[423:56.38]What?
[424:14.34]Easter eggs alright I'm gonna let's try look what I'm trying to tell you is I've been playing VR exclusively for the last like three or four straight days okay so when I see a trailer that somebody says no no check it out it's great and I see those hands come down when I see these hands right there that's a VR game to me sorry
[424:46.27]Alright, what else we got?
[424:47.03]Looks pretty good.
[425:05.68]You're still in VR.
[425:07.42]Thank you!
[425:07.80]By the way, VRJosh, make sure I get a chance to say thanks for giving me the tips on getting OVRDrop to work.
[426:00.11]Cool.
[426:00.99]Looks pretty cool, actually.
[426:04.94]Looks pretty cool.
[426:07.80]If you like Half-Life and that shit, which is essentially the PBR of video games.
[426:13.32]That was a joke.
[426:14.24]I'm just kidding.
[426:14.68]This is a fucking joke.
[426:16.32]That's not real.
[426:17.96]That is an absolute not true statement.
[426:19.99]Just want to make sure that's very clear.
[426:34.09]That looked really cool, actually.
[426:36.27]But I'm not sure I'll play it.
[426:44.48]What am I trying to do here?
[426:45.50]I'm trying to upset as many people as possible, apparently.
[426:47.62]Is this one of those streams?
[426:49.14]Yeah, let me, like, prod this way, and then I prod that way, and... Yo, hey, PBR sucks!
[426:54.62]Half-Life!
[426:56.89]And then I duck.
[426:59.03]Hey!
[427:00.33]Half-Life 2 is stupid!
[427:04.31]Oh shit, that guy got really mad.
[427:06.79]What am I doing?
[427:07.31]Don't haha me on my own stream.
[427:21.60]Hey, thank you again to Commando for the trailer for Black Mesa.
[427:30.50]If I see two to three thousand more hahas over the course of the next six years, I'll stop streaming.
[427:38.70]And by the way, it has to be unique IPS that do it.
[427:41.68]So you only get to do it once.
[427:44.19]So all of you are using it right now.
[427:45.75]Thank you.
[427:47.15]There'll be like 200.
[427:48.41]Just fucking dropping shit.
[427:56.40]Yeah, unique.
[427:56.98]It's going to be unique IP.
[427:57.82]Sorry.
[427:58.66]You can do it like 50 times if you want.
[428:00.04]It's not going to count.
[428:05.81]I'm behind.
[428:06.35]You got multiple IPS.
[428:08.55]I have a VPN.
[428:09.35]You can't catch me.
[428:09.93]You don't think I can?
[428:12.11]I know exactly where you're coming from.
[428:16.06]Sweden, right?
[428:17.16]Got it.
[428:17.74]Thank you.
[428:18.48]Moving on.
[428:24.57]Hey, all of you, thanks for the $1.
[428:27.28]I'm really upset today because my family had to sell their hay almost.
[428:33.08]Thanks for the good times.
[428:36.53]I'll spell it out.
[428:37.11]B-E-A-T-E-R.
[428:41.93]Jesse, you got it.
[428:42.75]Thanks for the $2.50.
[428:43.33]I got that argument already done.
[428:46.16]Thank you for the $2.50.
[428:49.51]We've got Garfield coming back again for $1.
[428:51.36]All this odd bears on Wall Street talk.
[428:54.60]And Jerma gets mad when Garf talks about things that aren't real.
[428:57.06]Of course it's not real, Jerma.
[428:58.94]I'm a cartoon cat.
[429:01.48]Although Pookie actually does work on Wall Street.
[429:04.73]You know that bear from the Garfield comic strips?
[429:07.97]I've never even seen it.
[429:11.22]Yeah, he actually wrestles bulls on Wall Street.
[429:13.14]Let me, let me let you in on a little secret, Jeremiah.
[429:16.24]Some of my bits are actually are real.
[429:18.80]They just go through a Garfield-themed filter.
[429:20.77]Since I'm Garfield, of course they would.
[429:27.11]This is sad.
[429:28.51]Poochie, reset the universe.
[429:36.15]What does that mean?
[429:40.96]thank you garfield no you're very real uh deus morte thanks for the three dollars hello Jeremy you're my most favorite streamer in zawarudo keep it up yours truly muda muda mudo don't thank you uh for the three dollars
[430:01.53]Dork Cube, thanks for the $2.50.
[430:03.09]Here's a fun game to determine your superhero name.
[430:05.39]What?
[430:05.57]How crazy.
[430:06.63]Alright, so your first name is your current address of residence.
[430:09.79]Your middle name is the number on the front of your credit card.
[430:12.04]And your last name is your Twitch password.
[430:14.46]What did you get?
[430:15.00]I'll tell you after you tell me yours.
[430:24.16]That would be a really weird superhero name.
[430:33.44]Now, don't tell anybody your address on the internet.
[430:35.38]Be careful.
[430:37.84]Unless it's like an Amazon order.
[430:41.69]In that case, like, it's automated.
[430:46.21]Thank you, Lula Moore, for the $3.
[430:49.21]Jerma, will you do an interview for my school about role models?
[430:54.27]What is with everybody wanting to do interviews with me?
[430:59.39]No one ever asked me this before.
[431:02.32]Oh, this is just kidding.
[431:03.44]I'm 34 and not in school.
[431:05.84]Oh, there we go.
[431:06.41]Okay.
[431:06.65]I probably should have kept reading.
[431:09.65]I just wanted to say thank you again for keeping your spirit up.
[431:12.23]I regularly get excited about your streams and my husband and kids think I'm weird.
[431:16.19]You're like TGIF TV, but on Twitch.
[431:20.96]Love the streams.
[431:21.62]You're a cool guy.
[431:22.38]P.S.
[431:22.62]Don't ever meet up with strangers.
[431:23.90]You'll definitely get killed.
[431:27.56]I'm...
[431:29.70]tgif TV thank god it's Friday TV I like to know what that is isn't that from like tbs tgif TV what network was this abc tgif
[431:56.97]Yeah, the 18 to 49 demographic for most of the 1990s.
[432:04.61]TGIF is just, look, okay, ready?
[432:09.20]Okay, I'm going to make a restaurant here.
[432:10.70]I'm going to bring you to a restaurant.
[432:11.90]I'm going to bring you inside that restaurant.
[432:14.76]I'm going to take you into a booth and you're going to order whatever you want on the menu.
[432:19.18]All the brand names are blocked out.
[432:21.16]You don't know what anything is.
[432:22.60]You just know that you are in a restaurant.
[432:24.94]Okay, so you order the fish and chips because it's guaranteed to be on here.
[432:30.44]You eat the fish and chips.
[432:32.08]Hey, that was like a 6 to 7 out of 10, I guess.
[432:35.12]Where are we?
[432:36.37]Oh, well, why don't you step outside, and I'll show you.
[432:39.03]So, okay, you're blindfolded at this point.
[432:41.55]You know, we just get outside somehow.
[432:44.03]You look at the sign.
[432:45.41]The sign says TGI Fridays.
[432:48.43]You go, oh, okay.
[432:50.62]That makes sense.
[432:52.46]Okay, that's good.
[432:53.86]And then what you don't know is I dropped the veil.
[432:57.76]This is going nowhere.
[432:59.06]I dropped the veil in front of the sign out front.
[433:02.49]And it's actually a Chili's because they're the same restaurant.
[433:06.35]And I could have just said that Chili's and TJ Friday's are the same restaurant.
[433:10.72]There's no differences.
[433:18.34]You eat blindfolded at a Chili's and eat blindfolded at a TGI Friday's, even the way that people talk to you is the same.
[433:29.19]What a walk that story was.
[433:30.75]Yeah, first of all, I blindfold you and then you come on in and I sit you down at a restaurant and you get the fish and chips and none of that matters.
[433:39.38]I just gave you like five anime filler episodes for one punch in a fight scene.
[433:45.30]Not even the whole thing.
[433:52.35]Don't ask me why I did that.
[433:54.99]But anyways, thank you, Lula.
[434:00.05]Appreciate the three bucks.
[434:04.03]And the kind messages.
[434:05.00]Thank you.
[434:06.60]Hey, Tingy!
[434:07.10]We're getting close to the end here.
[434:08.08]Thank you, Tingy, for the $2.51.
[434:09.28]I found a penny for my last message.
[434:12.04]It took me a while because Canada doesn't use pennies anymore, so I had to search for one.
[434:17.02]Found it in some snow after my dog sled went over it and felt a bump while on my way to Tim Hortons for a double-double.
[434:31.21]Is that for Canada doesn't have pennies anymore?
[434:35.17]They took them out of circulation?
[434:42.08]Yeah, okay, so you eat at Chili's.
[434:44.66]You go down, you have the fish and chips.
[434:46.88]You're like, oh, this fish and chips, you're like crunching, it tastes weird.
[434:50.45]This is like really kind of gross.
[434:52.37]It tastes really off to me.
[434:54.51]And you take a sip and you're like, oh, that's also off.
[434:57.31]What the fuck is going on?
[434:58.47]This is disgusting.
[434:59.59]And I take you outside, the blindfold's still on you.
[435:01.61]I spin you around, I take the blindfold off.
[435:03.27]It says TGI Fridays or Chili's.
[435:05.25]You're like, oh, TGI Fridays.
[435:06.45]I drop the fucking veil, it's PBR.
[435:08.79]You've been eating and drinking PBR.
[435:10.10]That's why he said that.
[435:16.41]Hey, Commando!
[435:17.18]Thanks for the $4, Commando Nam.
[435:21.26]I got in a heated argument with my friend today about what's better, Halo 2 or Call of Duty 2.
[435:26.28]I choose Halo 2, and he chose Call of Duty 2.
[435:28.55]The worst Call of Duty World War 2 game of all time.
[435:34.09]Um... I mean, you kind of have to go with Halo 2.
[435:44.85]Halo 2 did a lot to define multiplayer shooters.
[435:52.05]It was, you know, linking up with your friends and playing.
[435:54.59]Halo 2 was like the golden eye of that generation of continuing the FPS genre.
[436:04.82]That makes sense, right?
[436:06.30]You're not going to pull my skin off my face and there's like a PBR under there.
[436:09.44]That's a good point.
[436:22.33]But, yeah, I'd say Call of Duty is... There's just too many of them.
[436:28.66]It's the same thing, like, I don't understand, like, Battlefield V came out.
[436:32.90]And what the heck, it's not doing, it's not selling as well as we wanted it to?
[436:38.34]Just stop making those.
[436:39.82]Make a different video game.
[436:42.36]I don't understand.
[436:43.32]So, you've got Battlefield 4, Battlefield 1, Battlefield 5.
[436:46.95]What's next, Battlefield 6?
[436:50.55]What's next?
[436:54.90]Just do something else.
[436:56.95]But I have an idea.
[436:58.27]Let's do Battlefield again, but Star Wars.
[437:01.77]Just give... DICE has one of the best fucking engines in the entire country.
[437:06.71]And I'm talking all countries.
[437:09.43]That Frostbite engine is insane.
[437:13.67]Do a different IP.
[437:14.49]Do something else.
[437:17.88]But this time we're going to put planes in it.
[437:19.96]I don't get that.
[437:20.74]It was really great.
[437:22.62]Fucking battlefield was amazing.
[437:24.96]Some of those new generation battlefields were so like a real battlefield moment.
[437:30.23]I know what you're talking about.
[437:33.75]But you don't think it's time to like hang up the battlefield coat and get a new coat?
[437:41.77]You don't even have to throw it away.
[437:44.23]You can put it in the attic.
[437:50.65]I would love it.
[437:51.25]I would love DICE to do something else.
[438:02.57]I don't know.
[438:03.01]And this is just my, this is my just fucking bread opinion.
[438:09.14]But I feel the same way about Call of Duty 2.
[438:11.84]Activision hired three different studios to pump them out over and over again.
[438:17.15]It's like, why don't you just combine those three studios' collective intelligence quotients?
[438:22.10]And the three of you come up with a fucking new great experience.
[438:25.40]Have it pass around the office.
[438:29.10]Does COD still sell?
[438:30.10]Is that still a sell point?
[438:31.44]Does COD still sell that much?
[438:35.16]That you still have the three teams on it?
[438:38.58]Does it?
[438:39.16]I don't think, I feel like it doesn't.
[438:41.46]It does?
[438:53.36]But yeah, I mean, I would love to see the creative people that are behind some of these games just do something else.
[439:07.85]Call of Duty is almost a guaranteed casual shooter pickup.
[439:10.51]Yeah.
[439:13.89]Blobs 4 has been crazy popular.
[439:16.81]Maybe I'm just old and fucking out of touch.
[439:21.17]But I remember, I was supposed to just grab the mic and scream Banjo-Kazooie into the mic.
[439:25.93]I was gonna go, Banjo-Kazooie!
[439:27.15]When that came out, I was gonna scream it.
[439:28.86]Good thing I didn't.
[439:35.10]There's a lot of talented people in this industry.
[439:39.38]I feel like just making the next Jason movie is not the way to use the resources there.
[439:46.02]But that's just me.
[439:47.82]You know?
[439:48.14]And I like Kermit the Frog most.
[439:50.42]You know that one?
[440:03.43]Almost at the end.
[440:07.43]Germans still waiting for Half-Life 3.
[440:10.17]Yeah, it'd be nice.
[440:11.23]It'd be cool.
[440:18.46]They pump them up because Battlefield and CoD makes money and they're safe.
[440:26.10]Yeah, I guess.
[440:34.39]Turn up the music, Sonny.
[440:35.51]Ooh, is it low?
[440:36.57]It's not even on, you're right.
[440:40.19]Money talks.
[440:44.01]Well, let's hope that Phil spends her after buying like 38 studios.
[440:50.29]Maybe they'll make something together.
[440:51.39]Alright, where the hell were we?
[441:04.55]Just wait till I make my own game company.
[441:07.40]The first thing I'm gonna make is gonna be an ant simulator.
[441:11.50]Massive multiplayer.
[441:13.91]You get one life as a bug.
[441:15.55]You could spawn as an ant.
[441:17.51]Right?
[441:17.69]Everybody's an ant.
[441:19.91]There's like 500,000 people servers.
[441:22.71]You could do it because the amount of data required for an ant that doesn't do anything besides eat and walk in your hands can work.
[441:31.38]You could have a million people in that server.
[441:33.72]And you all have to work towards getting the queen, more babies, and then you can colonize and fight each other.
[441:44.75]You could do it.
[441:51.33]You get to level up, become like a worker ant.
[441:54.43]And then a flying ant.
[441:56.55]You could even go as far as you could have like different skill trees, like red ant.
[442:00.64]When you bite somebody, it's one point of fire damage per tick for 10 seconds.
[442:06.48]I do consulting work.
[442:08.44]Just give me, just give me money and I'll do it.
[442:12.12]Just one of these game companies hit me up.
[442:13.84]I'll take a $15 million check.
[442:16.64]One damage, one damage per fire of tick.
[442:19.11]That's worth a lot.
[442:25.39]I'm in one of those moods.
[442:28.01]I don't know why it popped up after being out of VR.
[442:30.41]I think it's because I'm allowed to breathe now.
[442:35.37]When you become 100, you're a queen, yeah.
[442:43.07]I can't wait to floss as an ant.
[442:45.49]Alright, let's do the bits.
[442:50.43]Somebody said something about a penny, and then we ended up there.
[442:52.39]No, no, no, it was Call of Duty 2 versus Halo.
[442:56.20]I'd say Halo 2, but that's just me.
[442:59.50]Thank you, Nate, for the $3.
[443:00.60]Hey, what about Half-Life 2 Beta?
[443:03.26]It's free and has some really good content.
[443:04.66]If you're not going to play free Half-Life, then buy Half-Life 1.
[443:07.51]I don't want to play Half-Life.
[443:13.07]Why do I have to play Half-Life?
[443:15.81]I already played Half-Life.
[443:18.48]I played Half-Life 1.
[443:19.48]I played Half-Life 2.
[443:21.84]The motor boat part made me almost throw up because I didn't understand what FOV was back when I was 19.
[443:30.82]Episode 1, Episode 2, I watched a friend play them.
[443:34.72]I've experienced it.
[443:35.83]I thought they were great.
[443:39.35]Hey, Al Mew, thanks for the $2.
[443:41.63]I really enjoy the stream and you're the only content creator that makes me laugh uncontrollably.
[443:45.93]Sometimes I think you're a hey-who almost.
[443:49.79]B-E-T-T-E-R.
[443:53.18]Thank you, Al Mew, for the $2.
[443:55.38]Thank you, YesIsOnline, for the $2.50.
[443:57.00]You've disrespected my gin and tonic and that's unforgivable.
[444:01.34]Gin and tonic is the best drink for casual sipping and hardcore chugging.
[444:05.36]Aviator Gin, the true chads drink Jerma gin.
[444:10.36]Oh, they don't.
[444:15.75]True chads funnel Corona.
[444:30.10]True Jerma fans drink hot cider.
[444:44.88]Smirnoff?
[444:45.58]I remember, okay, Smirnoff was one of those things when you turn 21 and you have no idea what alcohol you should be drinking.
[444:54.30]Oh, I turned 21.
[444:55.28]Oh, what am I going to get for my first drink?
[444:57.78]Um, I'll have a Smirnoff Ice.
[445:02.65]Everybody does that.
[445:04.67]And you drink it, you're like, yeah, I guess it's cool.
[445:07.23]I just ordered this legally.
[445:09.19]I just like ordered this.
[445:12.25]You want another one?
[445:12.91]He's asking if I want another.
[445:16.45]Uh, yeah.
[445:18.23]Give me another Smirnoff Ice.
[445:21.05]He opens it for you.
[445:21.93]You can't even believe it.
[445:31.75]When you're 21.
[445:32.39]Yeah, I don't know what the hell to order.
[445:37.58]And then I, my palate got a little better.
[445:41.48]Started to actually give a shit about, you know, where my alcohol was coming from.
[445:46.70]You know, what farm the alcohol was raised on, what it was allowed.
[445:51.52]You know, it was free range alcohol.
[445:53.32]I've started to care about those kinds of things.
[446:01.31]And started drinking wine out of a box.
[446:19.63]Ass chug.
[446:20.67]Why did I read that?
[446:21.57]The one guy... You were right.
[446:23.37]I always just end up reading the one guy.
[446:28.70]This has been fun.
[446:29.88]This has been fun.
[446:34.40]Thank you, Commando, for the $3.
[446:35.96]I drink chocolate milk every day.
[446:38.04]I've been drinking it since 2007.
[446:41.26]Four years after I was born.
[446:45.33]Hold on, wait.
[446:45.99]Doctors say that 2% of my blood is chocolate milk.
[446:52.12]2007, four years after his... How, what?
[447:04.87]Thank you for three dollars.
[447:06.95]Don't drink chocolate milk every day.
[447:08.35]It's too much sugary substances.
[447:11.28]Drink almond milk.
[447:14.62]It's better for you.
[447:16.86]Right?
[447:17.58]Here I go.
[447:18.30]Here I go.
[447:20.35]I'm walking in the Starbucks right now and I've got the glasses on and I've got my hair styled that way.
[447:24.61]See what I mean?
[447:25.77]Look!
[447:27.27]It's already there.
[447:27.85]You drink cow's milk?
[447:34.35]Idiot.
[447:40.13]The, like, Starbucks elitist almond milk user is here.
[447:54.24]room here that that guy's multi-trip your band for at least 600 streams have I even done shave okay no I will thank you for saying that now I'm gonna grow it up for like three years I'm not gonna shave again that one guy said shave in all capitals no I'm not gonna shave for three years
[448:26.76]No, no.
[448:28.21]Cream in your coffee, milk in your coffee, almond milk.
[448:30.11]I don't really like soy milk.
[448:32.39]I don't think that doesn't taste very good.
[448:33.55]It tastes like it's made out of plastic.
[448:35.25]That's just what I think.
[448:36.57]Coconut milk is a little... I don't like it.
[448:38.44]It tastes like coconut flakes.
[448:42.48]Rice milk is too watery.
[448:44.48]Almond milk sits right in a perfect place for me.
[448:50.67]Plus, I can't really eat that.
[448:51.69]I can't have that much dairy.
[449:03.17]Just drink water.
[449:04.77]You can't put water in your coffee.
[449:11.86]Oh yeah, what am I going to put in my coffee to make it a little... You know, maybe give it a little substance.
[449:17.26]How about some more water?
[449:22.66]What other thing can I fucking bring up and talk about how I don't like it?
[449:29.12]No, I like regular milk.
[449:31.99]I just can't drink it.
[449:38.82]Put some PBR in it.
[449:44.18]But thank you, Shawnee Noodles, for the $5.
[449:46.32]Can you play Mountain Blade Warband, the Game of Thrones mod, as a joke for a couple hours before the new season premieres as a joke stream?
[449:58.56]Maybe.
[449:59.58]I haven't ruled it out.
[450:00.26]What do you mean I haven't ruled it out?
[450:03.74]You just brought up a suggestion.
[450:04.92]You know, I haven't ruled that out.
[450:07.41]I just was able to rule it in by you saying that.
[450:13.65]But thank you, Shawnee Noodles.
[450:15.93]Mr. Frazeeer, thank you Mr. Frazeeer for the 10 bucks.
[450:20.37]Just want to say that I appreciate all your content you put out since the early days of putting around in TF2.
[450:25.92]You remain consistently entertaining and intelligent for so long that I can't do anything but aspire to be as driven as you.
[450:35.09]That's an incredibly nice thing to say about somebody.
[450:42.51]I mean, come on.
[450:45.19]I know what market cap is.
[450:49.41]I know where all the continents are.
[450:54.46]Huh?
[451:01.06]A 5G tower, have I heard of them?
[451:02.72]5G?
[451:05.85]Yeah, that's the new... It's 3G, 4G LTE, 5G LTE.
[451:09.78]It's coming.
[451:14.50]How many continents are there?
[451:15.86]Just enough for people to live on them.
[451:20.91]But no, that's... Mr. Fraser, thank you so much for the 10 bucks.
[451:28.01]I... I'm happy that I could potentially inspire somebody...
[451:38.16]To do something.
[451:39.52]To care about something.
[451:41.16]Regardless of what it is.
[451:44.24]Thank you.
[451:45.10]For the ten bucks.
[451:47.44]Uh, then we also had Commando came in with $2.50.
[451:49.57]Sorry, I accidentally pressed enter.
[451:50.87]I guess you could say I'm a chocolate milk man.
[451:55.17]Chocolate milk man.
[451:57.37]I miss the days where you could get chocolate milk delivered to your house.
[452:01.21]In the bottles.
[452:01.69]You know, the guy that comes to your door that was dressed like a doctor for some reason.
[452:09.43]What was with that outfit?
[452:11.77]It was like a doctor taxi cab driver.
[452:24.14]You were alive for those?
[452:25.56]No, I'm just saying I missed that opportunity to have the guy, like, that's the sound, but when the, you know, you didn't even see what I did.
[452:38.72]It's the milk in the grate that he's carrying.
[452:46.70]Thank you, Sten Fisken, for the ten bucks.
[452:50.77]Well, you're guaranteed to get at least a few of those per stream.
[452:52.39]Guaranteed.
[453:08.51]But thanks for being around for a while.
[453:11.51]And thank you for the $10.
[453:12.24]It means a lot.
[453:15.44]Uh, Rembo, thanks for the $2.50.
[453:16.62]I wore my new Jerma Night Sky shirt to work today.
[453:19.00]Two people came up to me to say it was a nice shirt.
[453:21.68]It's fucking mint.
[453:24.04]It's a very nice shirt.
[453:27.40]I'd say one of the best.
[453:32.30]Yeah, thank you for purchasing it.
[453:35.01]Thank you for wearing it.
[453:36.23]Thank you for thinking it's cool.
[453:40.54]Hey, toshiro.TV, thanks for the $2.50.
[453:42.54]I was planning on stopping by Hash House when I'm in Vegas since you said you had the best burger you've ever had.
[453:47.10]Do you remember what it was?
[453:49.68]Let me tell you something.
[453:51.80]Hash House at GoGo is like the best restaurant in Vegas.
[453:58.91]If you ever find yourself at the link, go to Hash House and get anything on that menu.
[454:06.49]That place is ridiculous.
[454:08.77]Absolutely ridiculous.
[454:13.82]You can say sponsored all you want.
[454:15.02]That's the best fucking food I've probably ever had in my life.
[454:19.99]Uh, the burger I had, it was a, I believe it was a blue cheese spread on the burger.
[454:25.32]It was huge.
[454:26.54]The meat was cooked and squashed up and smashed up perfectly.
[454:30.82]Plenty of good condiments on it.
[454:32.14]It was big.
[454:36.81]What kind of food?
[454:37.45]It is just like big portion comfort food.
[454:41.31]They have burgers.
[454:42.69]They have like meatloaf sandwiches.
[454:44.87]They've got fried chicken and they've got waffles.
[454:47.30]They've got so much.
[454:48.82]They've got a, they've got like a chorizo hash.
[454:53.54]You will eat a piece of that chorizo hash and then you will just lie back and go, everything is fine.
[455:01.87]Everything on Earth is fine.
[455:07.50]Great Canadian Fuck Club gave $50 to say I'm willing to die on this jump hill.
[455:12.06]$50 to unfortunately be incorrect.
[455:22.88]But thank you so much for the $50 and your astronomical insane contributions over the last four months of the streams.
[455:31.69]Thank you.
[455:33.04]But, HashHouseAgoGo, everyone asks, oh, you've been at Vegas for a while.
[455:36.36]Favorite spot.
[455:36.82]That's definitely it.
[455:45.31]It's the one that's in the link.
[455:51.69]He's responsible for thousands of dollars.
[455:53.55]It's unbelievable.
[455:54.89]Thank you.
[456:01.81]But, yeah, um... Toshiro, hope you enjoy it.
[456:05.39]A lot of good stuff, a lot of cool stuff to see, a lot of amazing restaurants.
[456:09.37]If you're visiting Vegas and you've never been here, you are gonna have a great time.
[456:19.29]It's snowing in Las Vegas.
[456:22.07]Yeah.
[456:23.61]It's been snowing in random places.
[456:26.03]It's like the first time it's happened in a long time, apparently.
[456:30.58]Is there snow in here?
[456:31.24]Hold on.
[456:42.88]That's fucking ridiculous.
[456:48.21]Snow in Las Vegas.
[456:49.69]Accumulating snow in Las Vegas.
[456:55.43]Jeremiah brought the snow to Vegas.
[457:00.10]Yeah, that's something I never thought I'd ever see.
[457:04.66]How much snow was on the ground, Vitalik?
[457:08.58]Did you get a chance to go out there?
[457:12.97]Because that's crazy.
[457:23.98]Like an inch or more.
[457:25.26]Wow!
[457:27.76]Yeah, if it snows even a dusting out here, the whole state goes into a meltdown mode, because you don't have any way to deal with that.
[457:35.87]They don't ever get it.
[457:37.53]That's insane.
[457:41.41]But thank you, Great Canadian Fuck Club, for your $50 and your $10 here.
[457:45.29]They say it's okay to be wrong, Jerma, but it's definitely Jupp.
[457:52.84]It's not Jupiter.
[457:54.56]It's the name of a planet.
[457:56.00]Scientists came together and named that planet Jupiter.
[458:00.30]The one guy in the back that said, we should name it Jupiter.
[458:04.18]They fucking handed that guy his books and they fired his ass.
[458:06.92]$50 from Great Canadian.
[458:16.34]$50 to admit I'm right.
[458:18.50]Now, money does not come above principles, okay?
[458:23.26]Thank you for the $110.
[458:27.43]Money does not come above principle, and therefore, Jupiter, jupe.
[458:36.69]You could pay me $50,000 more, and I would still say jupe.
[458:42.56]I've got my integrity.
[458:43.52]See, underneath this PBR t-shirt that I'm wearing, my PBR-themed wristbands that I wear every day, there's integrity under here.
[458:57.27]Here comes, that's the 50,000 bait.
[459:03.06]But thank you so much, dude.
[459:04.46]That's too much money.
[459:05.96]Too much money.
[459:08.32]You spoil me.
[459:09.30]You flatter me.
[459:10.26]Thank you.
[459:21.65]Hey, Nate, thanks for the $3, Nate.
[459:25.71]Somebody handcrafted their own Blockbuster video sign for 13 bucks on eBay.
[459:30.45]You should get it.
[459:32.67]Where the hell am I gonna put that?
[459:35.43]I'm just gonna hang that out my front door?
[459:39.91]That would end up in a closet and I would never take it out.
[459:47.50]Get Half-Life for Dreamcast, it's not that hard.
[459:52.56]Half-Life for Dream... I've already beat... I've already played... What's with the Half-Life?
[460:02.91]Get Half-Life for Dreamcast.
[460:04.23]It's not hard.
[460:06.13]Why is there no forehead here after this?
[460:10.39]Half-Life is a great game.
[460:11.25]I've beat Half-Life on the computer probably two or three times.
[460:19.26]The Dreamcast is not going to give me anything more than that.
[460:30.39]They're desperate to get you to play Half-Life.
[460:32.59]I've already done it.
[460:36.68]I've done it.
[460:37.24]I've already done this thing.
[460:39.34]That you are so... So hell-bent on telling me to do.
[460:44.96]I can understand if it was like... Hey, get a... You should get Bloodborne.
[460:50.77]Ah, maybe one day.
[460:51.45]I've never played it before, though.
[460:52.47]Maybe one day.
[460:53.57]Dude, get Bloodborne.
[460:54.97]Nah, maybe.
[460:55.75]I don't think so.
[460:57.95]No, it's like, hey, you should get Bloodborne.
[460:59.29]I love Bloodborne.
[460:59.97]It's a great game.
[461:00.53]I've played it a bunch.
[461:01.79]You gotta get Bloodborne, though.
[461:03.87]I've... I've... I love that game.
[461:06.23]It's a very, very good game.
[461:07.51]I've... I've played it.
[461:09.35]Have you played Bloodborne yet, though?
[461:11.98]Yeah.
[461:13.02]I've... Yes, I have.
[461:18.04]Just play Bloodborne already.
[461:24.50]When... When is this guy even gonna get Bloodborne?
[461:30.08]But in all seriousness now, I forgot that Half-Life did come out on Dreamcast.
[461:36.31]Did it come out on anything else?
[461:44.41]The Old Hunters.
[461:46.00]That is an amazing DLC.
[461:48.46]Was it on PS2?
[461:58.32]But yes, I love Half-Life, but I'm not going to play it on the Dreamcast.
[462:10.24]Thank you, though.
[462:11.60]Hey, Commando, thanks for the $3.
[462:13.01]There was an ending to the trailer.
[462:14.81]D. Oh, no, he did this.
[462:20.93]Well, it's alright.
[462:22.83]Thank you, Jess.
[462:23.59]You got it for the $1.
[462:24.33]It's a YouTube link, and it's probably a gnome.
[462:27.95]No, it's close enough.
[462:30.47]Same two letters.
[462:35.43]Thank you.
[462:35.83]Moo means moo for the five dollars.
[462:37.30]Half-Life more like mad wife.
[462:40.64]Haha, Karen.
[462:42.92]Let me see those kids.
[462:44.00]I miss them.
[462:46.66]What the fuck?
[462:51.10]Uh, thank you.
[462:53.70]Thank you, moo, for the five bucks.
[462:57.05]Hey, Axian, thanks for the $1.
[462:58.15]Hey, Jerma, I made the news bloopers video like you predicted a few streams ago.
[463:03.20]I would be really happy if you showed it to the stream.
[463:05.00]Just type in Jerma news bloopers on YouTube in the first link.
[463:10.72]Sorry, I'm not a sub.
[463:12.72]What did I just say?
[463:19.34]Jerma news bloopers on YouTube.
[463:25.07]Oh, I can't, I don't see it.
[463:33.62]Jerm, type in.
[463:34.50]Okay, there it is.
[463:45.49]Yeah, sure, why not?
[463:46.13]Let's watch it.
[463:53.03]Don't look at that.
[463:53.45]That's personal info on there.
[463:54.47]Don't look at that.
[463:56.15]Never mind.
[463:56.93]Alright, so I've got my trusty stopwatch and here they come down the hill.
[464:00.65]It looks like Ruben is in the lead and here comes out.
[464:06.49]That was a bad idea.
[464:08.05]Look at the dew point in the area right now.
[464:10.18]Right now dew points in the 20s and near 30 degrees across central Mississippi.
[464:15.06]Well, hey there.
[464:15.74]That's right, Diane.
[464:16.70]We got the
[464:19.20]I can't right now
[464:41.86]Is he running out of gas?
[464:44.25]He's stopping at like that mini mart kind of thing at that gas station.
[464:48.59]He's getting out of the car.
[464:49.31]Interesting.
[464:49.91]Okay.
[464:50.79]Well, at least we saw the car door open.
[464:52.75]Maybe he's letting his pass.
[464:53.75]Okay.
[464:55.21]Was that the driver's side?
[464:57.16]Looks like he's wearing a different shirt.
[464:58.40]I feel like he was wearing a blue shirt before.
[465:01.55]We will get our pick.
[465:02.35]There we go.
[465:03.49]I don't know if the passenger got out of the vehicle.
[465:07.64]It didn't look like it, Colleen, but it's hard to say.
[465:10.30]I know.
[465:10.60]My eyes were on that driver's side.
[465:12.32]But now, Bruce, what would they do here if he's pulled into this?
[465:17.72]Oh, dear.
[465:18.66]We might have the wrong car, Colleen.
[465:19.82]Is this our guy again?
[465:21.46]I think this is our man.
[465:22.56]They want everybody who doesn't have a reason to be outside inside their home.
[465:29.28]You heard from the mayor.
[465:30.91]I thought that was me for a second.
[465:32.15]Those people are naked?
[465:32.85]No.
[465:44.32]The Chicago Tribune, 19 people were hospitalized at a furry convention in Illinois.
[465:51.66]What?
[465:52.18]This is real?
[465:53.29]What's a furry?
[465:54.07]What's a furry?
[465:56.45]What?
[465:57.01]Did I get that wrong?
[465:57.97]Oh, gosh.
[465:58.99]Okay, officials were called when a strong odor of chlorine spread.
[466:10.68]I think they had to evacuate the building and everything.
[466:14.02]Set the hotel guests along with convention attendees into the cold night.
[466:18.28]Many still dressed in their furry, furry costumes.
[466:22.68]The police officer was trying to pull his pool over when he got out of the car and started to run.
[466:29.34]Well, he didn't get very far.
[466:31.10]I wonder if the car gets like an assist.
[466:33.14]You know what I mean?
[466:34.08]For the takedown.
[466:34.82]For the takeout.
[466:35.62]Like, you should have been driving me anyway.
[466:37.87]Central Indiana had a couple of showers.
[466:43.58]I told you not to throw it.
[466:47.88]Can you see that?
[466:48.64]See that right there?
[466:51.04]Oh, boy.
[466:51.36]Oh, boy.
[466:53.38]The pass through right there was perfect.
[466:54.78]And I think, yeah, I think we do have his description.
[466:59.14]Can we take that?
[466:59.78]Let's take his description.
[467:00.68]Okay.
[467:08.61]Okay.
[467:09.32]This is the guy they wanted people in Pennsylvania to be out on the lookout for.
[467:14.24]He's got a nose and some hair that goes like that.
[467:18.62]He's got kind of a chin that comes down to almost a point.
[467:24.34]Stands about 5 feet 4 inches tall.
[467:26.24]Oh, come on.
[467:27.40]There it is.
[467:28.54]Get a good look for yourself.
[467:29.52]You had to have that one.
[467:30.34]Oh, and now I'm getting word that police actually caught this guy.
[467:33.30]Thanks to the sketch, no doubt.
[467:35.36]So, here's a picture of the real guy next to the sketch that led to his arrest.
[467:41.22]It's uncanny, Lisa.
[467:45.47]Oh, this is the same one.
[467:47.15]You have to do it twice.
[467:48.01]That was fucking ridiculous.
[468:03.74]That was fantastic.
[468:07.84]Link, Link, hey, I'll get you, Link.
[468:13.24]That was really, really good.
[468:15.11]Job well done.
[468:16.33]I look forward to when you do it again.
[468:18.03]Because of that end there.
[468:21.35]Play League of Legends, Jermo.
[468:25.50]I can't do that.
[468:26.92]I won't do that.
[468:28.36]I'm sorry.
[468:29.96]I'm sorry.
[468:30.48]You might be, like, a big fan of that game.
[468:31.76]I just, I can't, I can't do it.
[468:41.10]But thank you.
[468:43.47]So much for that video.
[468:47.53]Uh, that was Axion.
[468:50.53]Thank you, Axion.
[468:51.75]Hey, DubskiDude!
[468:53.51]Thanks for the one dollar.
[468:54.65]Taunt me about being the streamer all you like, but I need to remind you that long before the Movie Night stream, you played my videos live for precisely three minutes in total, meaning I was the streamer.
[469:05.84]I held the keys to the kingdom.
[469:07.12]I was a god.
[469:08.20]And yes, I'll totally take your stream when you retire.
[469:11.48]But the bit minimum will be $50 and sub mode will be on permanently.
[469:15.07]So get ready.
[469:17.05]It's not a bad idea.
[469:27.51]Did it work?
[469:34.34]My strength.
[469:37.16]You wouldn't dare.
[469:38.74]No, I can't do that.
[469:40.95]You know how many funny fucking things that I've seen in this chat from a non-sub?
[469:45.02]I've seen plenty of great things from subs, but there are at least five or six in the last 12 years that I've been streaming on Twitch.
[469:58.46]I was back when I was on Justin.TV.
[470:02.50]I was streaming me multi-boxing Warcraft.
[470:05.52]That's how I've been around for a long time.
[470:08.31]Remember, I was the guy with, like, the fucking orc multiboxing?
[470:21.21]I used to, like, raid.
[470:22.11]I used to raid Orgrimmar.
[470:24.58]I used to raid Stormwind by myself.
[470:27.58]It was wild.
[470:30.56]You probably remember me from the servers, yeah.
[470:48.37]I was there for those streams.
[470:49.41]See?
[470:49.61]Yeah, you remember.
[470:54.15]Some people remember that.
[470:55.25]I had like three viewers.
[471:06.29]I was all of them.
[471:07.21]See?
[471:20.06]Get him out.
[471:23.08]Get him out!
[471:23.48]Alright, here we go.
[471:29.08]Thank you, DupskiDudo, for the $1.
[471:31.24]Hey, CommandoNam, thanks for the $3.50.
[471:33.56]So, uh, Jeremiah, I watched an old stream, and you're telling me you never played an original Xbox game.
[471:40.29]Mech Assault, Conquer Live, Reloaded, none of that?
[471:42.59]That sucks, man.
[471:44.03]Hey, when do you get... Hey, when you do get an original Xbox, you better connect it to X-Link.
[471:56.00]I didn't have an original Xbox.
[471:58.03]I've played it a few times.
[471:59.77]Friends of mine had it.
[472:01.19]I've played Halo, Halo 2.
[472:02.43]You know, better than Call of Duty 2.
[472:05.13]If it was me giving my opinion on that, I think that'd be better than Call of Duty 2.
[472:12.84]But Conker?
[472:14.90]Yeah, I remember the original Conker for N64.
[472:16.28]What a game.
[472:21.48]But yeah, maybe one day.
[472:23.54]I got a lot of old console stuff to go through already.
[472:28.17]But thank you.
[472:30.01]Hey, something or other thanks to the 250.
[472:32.95]Remember that film Being John Malkovich?
[472:35.43]If that ever got a spiritual successor, I think you would be perfect to take on the prophilic role of having people walk into your brain.
[472:42.63]I would do it.
[472:44.58]Sign me up.
[472:46.22]I would give that role everything I had.
[472:47.62]Everything.
[472:49.34]Everything.
[472:51.69]Hey, Commando, thanks for the $2.51, and if you do get an original Xbox, get the Duke controller.
[472:56.73]If you have big hands, I do.
[472:57.97]They're huge.
[472:59.27]If not, get a Logitech controller, which is wireless, and get an HDMI cord instead of the original.
[473:04.21]I think Etalyx was talking about maybe getting an old Xbox.
[473:08.73]I will definitely pass that info along.
[473:15.34]Big, meaty claws.
[473:16.34]Yeah, I get big fucking hands, man.
[473:20.73]Look at when you grab a door handle.
[473:22.35]When I grab a door handle, my fingers go all the way around and touch the back of my hand.
[473:26.47]They're huge.
[473:28.29]They're big mittens.
[473:29.36]I got like baseball gloves on both hands.
[473:38.00]But thank you, Commando.
[473:39.94]But with the $3 again here, you never played Half-Life Opposing Force in Blue Shift.
[473:45.01]I did.
[473:45.83]I did play Blue Shift.
[473:47.11]With Barney.
[473:47.99]Barney.
[473:49.98]You start off, you walk around, he talks to you for a little while, you go over the, you're a police officer.
[473:55.32]I've played it.
[474:01.38]What is it with Half-Life?
[474:02.88]I'm getting, I'm getting half-lifed.
[474:07.34]I've played Opposing Force, I have.
[474:08.86]Long time ago.
[474:10.16]Very long time ago.
[474:12.11]Gentlemen, don't read this message too late.
[474:18.04]Hey, Deus Morte, thanks for the 250.
[474:19.66]Fun fact to you, I heard if you feel a... I heard if you feed a bee a turnip, its honey will be sweeter.
[474:27.26]I'm a professional, you can trust me.
[474:29.35]I don't trust anything that you just said.
[474:33.49]That sounds like something that would be shared on a 55-year-old lady's Facebook.
[474:48.14]But I do appreciate it.
[474:56.88]What?
[474:59.08]It's a... That's a... That's a... That's a BJ joke?
[475:02.76]What?
[475:03.92]How?
[475:08.10]How does... Where are you getting that from?
[475:18.72]Why am I being banned?
[475:25.40]Alright, alright, alright.
[475:26.50]Alright, settle down.
[475:28.06]Let's hit the brakes a little.
[475:35.07]Thank you, Nate, for the $3.
[475:36.09]It's another Half-Life question.
[475:43.75]I'm just gonna put a blanket statement on here.
[475:45.63]I'm never gonna play a Half-Life game on stream.
[475:48.75]Ever.
[475:50.41]So, there's no Half-Life game that I'm gonna play on this stream.
[475:54.69]I'm not gonna play Half-Life.
[475:56.51]It's a fucking wonderful series.
[475:58.25]Am I getting trolled at this point?
[476:08.28]Am I getting bit-baited like somebody just said?
[476:12.66]I have to be.
[476:15.76]Have you played Half-Life Grunt and Half-Life Paranoia?
[476:19.73]I don't even know what those are.
[476:32.30]Play Half-Life.
[476:36.90]It's been years.
[476:37.74]Where's Toontown?
[476:43.38]you can't even play toontown it got taken off the air but thank you for the uh the incredibly high interest in the game franchise Half-Life and also Nate thanks for the five bucks you also probably never heard of this but GTA 4 finally got an update last year they've removed songs on the car radio really that's interesting
[477:14.73]So what happens in the radio in the game now?
[477:19.57]That's weird.
[477:22.92]The music license expired.
[477:24.48]That's... That's interesting.
[477:28.20]They just aren't there.
[477:31.26]Hey, Commando!
[477:32.06]Thanks for the $4, Commando.
[477:33.94]I mean, during my blood is 2% chocolate milk, so I'm gonna be hyper every day.
[477:39.56]Okay, just do me a favor replace replace like two of those chocolate milks you drink a day with water and One other one that you drink a day with just what with one big cabinet.
[477:52.77]You know what I mean?
[477:53.29]Just that's all I ask Just crunch on a cabinet and you'll be fine She plays it with a PBR No, no, don't do that either.

[478:32.10]You guys, are you guys the same, are you guys the same person?
[478:36.09]It's an Etsy link to, uh, to a Half-Life.
[478:40.11]You trying to get me to buy something off your Etsy?
[478:46.66]coordinated it's a drinking game every drinking every time you say the word Half-Life chat is three people
[479:13.74]I like how Trevor doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts.
[479:16.58]Don't believe me?
[479:17.24]Watch me post this on my other accounts.
[479:19.74]No!
[479:26.47]What?
[479:29.45]What the fuck are you talking about?
[479:34.45]That doesn't make any sense.
[479:35.69]Hold on, am I live?
[479:40.42]What the fuck?
[479:43.38]Yeah, I think I'm going to contact Twitch about that.
[479:45.58]Because this... I didn't know.
[479:54.69]Yeah, somebody's got a hold of me, I think.
[479:57.27]Otherwise, I mean, what's my name on Twitch?
[479:59.89]Sherma98... There's another number.
[480:03.09]It's four?
[480:03.63]It's weird.
[480:08.76]I don't know.
[480:09.12]I understand that's weird.
[480:11.58]Because I feel like I shouldn't... Because I'm me.
[480:18.87]Getting to the end here.
[480:19.53]We've got only a few more.
[480:20.57]Thank you.
[480:22.15]Commando, thanks for the four dolls.
[480:23.51]I can mail you mine.
[480:24.97]I have all the accessories and games.
[480:27.81]I do not want you to mail me a copy of Half-Life for the Dreamcast.

[480:39.02]I bought it.
[480:40.70]I got Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[480:43.69]Can we put the Half-Life thing to bed?
[480:52.53]Can we, like, cease the Half-Life?

[481:04.78]Play Half-Life opposing Edds.
[481:12.81]It's a great series.
[481:14.45]Half-Life is a wonderful series.
[481:17.11]It truly is.
[481:27.28]Okay, I love how VRJosh just wrote that copypasta.
[481:33.05]It's like you're very clearly VRJosh.
[481:34.83]You're not that guy.
[481:47.56]When are you going to tell us about the status of clown in the town?
[481:58.31]Would you... Alright, things are going too fast here.
[482:01.17]Hold on.
[482:03.29]I've missed one.
[482:04.33]Hold on.
[482:07.53]Commando, thanks for the $4.

[482:23.31]Appreciate it.
[482:25.11]Uh, Superman, thanks for the $2.50.
[482:26.85]Halo Reach was by far the best Halo game I've ever played.
[482:29.14]I remember having so much fun with my friends, and the campaign and story were amazing.
[482:33.90]I love that game so much, and nothing will compare to it during its peak.
[482:43.46]Halo Reach?
[482:44.32]I don't think I've even played Halo Reach.
[482:50.02]Was it good?
[483:00.24]Halo Reach is more like Halo Peach.
[483:03.66]What does that mean?
[483:11.54]How long has it been since you had a sip of water?
[483:12.94]I don't know, a few days?

[483:40.65]Thank you for the four dollars.
[483:43.35]Thank you, Commando, for the three bucks.
[483:44.77]Halo Reach sucks.

[483:49.27]Be careful.
[483:49.67]Those are fighting words.
[483:54.76]Thank you, Commando.
[483:55.86]Three dollars.
[484:04.52]Thank you, Deus Morte, for the $2.50.

[484:12.31]I took a sip of my PBR and said we should go there after I finish my project on why Half-Life's the greatest video game ever.
[484:19.28]My friend said, perfect.
[484:20.12]He'll invite his Canadian friend to jump at her.
[484:32.67]Meme collage.
[484:33.69]That is what that was.
[484:36.43]Laynat, thanks for the five dollars.
[484:37.79]If we keep donating, he will have to stay live.

[484:56.01]Well, no, we got... Commando, three dollars and fifty cents.
[485:01.22]Well, Jerma, tell me this.
[485:02.14]Did you know that you can play an original Xbox game on the PS2?

[492:20.27]Hey, Great Canadian Fuck Club, thanks for the $15.

[492:26.59]Jupp.
[492:28.58]That's fine.
[492:29.36]If you want to call it that, I call it Ju, because the name of the planet is Jupiter.
[492:34.37]That's how I call it.
[492:37.57]If you want, I mean, you probably have an accent, right?
[492:40.73]Like a Jupiter.
[492:42.09]Like, oh, he, Jupiter.
[492:44.84]If you have an accent, of course you're going to say it a different way.
[492:51.72]Thank you nut for the two dollars.
[492:53.22]There is legit nothing wrong with my name.

[493:35.15]I got marbles up here that need to be recalibrated.
[493:37.27]I gotta re-rack the balls and pull.
[493:46.04]Commando, thanks for the $9.48.
[493:48.96]Listen, these are my last bits.

[493:56.79]Please, I'll mail the entire thing to you.
[493:58.79]Okay, bye.
[493:59.33]Have a great night.
[494:00.81]I'm not going to give you my address.
[494:05.67]That's not going to happen.
[494:14.12]What?
[494:14.94]Yeah, I wonder why.
[494:15.76]Let me think of some reasons why I wouldn't want to have my address given to somebody.
[494:21.59]Hmm.
[494:24.86]You think five hours is a lot?
[494:26.12]There's a guy that's spending a week in VR.
[494:29.25]Well, I... I applaud his eventual eye doctor that he would be giving lots of money to.
[494:37.47]He's asleep?
[494:45.90]Oh.
[494:49.12]But no, thank, I really appreciate the fact that you want to give me your Xbox.
[494:52.05]It's not necessary.
[494:53.63]You don't have to do that.
[494:54.59]Keep it.
[494:55.09]It's yours.
[494:56.85]You're going to need it one day.
[494:57.81]Because you're going to want to play something one day.
[495:00.03]And I do not give personal information to people that I do not know.
[495:05.38]That's it.
[495:10.44]Thank you, Wizard Ribbit for the one dollar.
[495:12.10]Jerma, has anyone ever told you you're a very handsome goblin?
[495:15.56]No, are you the first one?
[495:18.11]Uh, thank you Nut for the $2.
[495:19.58]Please someone crop that sequence into Nut.
[495:22.40]Blank, blank, blank.
[495:24.56]We're not lewd on this stream.
[495:27.29]We're PG-13.
[495:28.05]Thank you Snutzor for the $1.
[495:31.85]It'd be funny if you had a guitar stream, but you played Half-Life instead.
[495:35.66]Maybe.
[495:47.19]I let my children watch this stream.
[495:48.63]They've learned so much.
[495:50.55]Like, one, two, three, four, five.
[495:51.83]That's how you get from one to five.
[495:58.01]No, all kidding aside, we've been having a lot of fun this stream.
[496:01.91]We've been talking a lot of shit, just dicking around.
[496:04.49]Please, no.
[496:06.13]It's all in good fun.
[496:09.72]Don't take anything I say personally.
[496:11.94]Really hope you don't.
[496:14.29]And that's where we're gonna end it.
[496:15.93]So I will see you guys on... Friday.
[496:21.99]So not today, which is Thursday.
[496:25.41]I'll see you on Friday.
[496:26.09]I'm gonna go Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[496:27.37]We're gonna do the whole weekend.
[496:30.24]And that will lead us into the end of February.
[496:32.86]And I'll see you guys soon.
[496:36.74]I'm gonna go take a look at the snow in Las Vegas, because that's ridiculous.
[496:40.96]Have a great day.
[496:42.06]Have a great rest of your night.
[496:42.94]I'll see you guys really soon.
[496:44.50]We're going to take a break from VR.
[496:46.96]I will return to it next week.
[496:50.02]And much love to y'all.
[496:51.50]Thanks for hanging out.
[496:53.00]See you really soon.
[497:33.41]Thank you.
