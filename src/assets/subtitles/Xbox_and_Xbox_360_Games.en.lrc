[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.55]Oh, that was bad.
[00:05.77]Wait, hold on.
[00:14.57]That's okay.
[00:15.89]That's the first time I've spoken, like used my vocal cords in at least, I don't know, like 30 minutes.
[00:25.14]30 or 40 minutes ago, I went, oh, Otto!
[00:27.38]Otto!
[00:28.86]And I got ready.
[00:29.82]I haven't used him.
[00:31.68]Some saliva has been down there.
[00:35.60]Hello, happy Saturday.
[00:37.11]How's your weekend?
[00:39.21]Mine's doing pretty good.
[00:41.75]You guys ready for this weekend edition of the Jerma985 television program?
[00:48.25]Today, we've got an exciting program.
[00:50.89]This week.
[00:52.59]We're gonna play Xbox games.
[00:56.79]Some original, some Xbox 360.
[01:02.35]And let me just right off the bat tell you that yes, yes, we're going to play... I don't know what to say.
[01:13.80]We're gonna play... Yes, we're gonna play Sneak King, okay?
[01:17.86]Everybody relax.
[01:18.66]Relax.
[01:22.41]I couldn't even say it.
[01:23.25]I was like, my like voice trembled from like how dumb this is.
[01:28.45]Like how stupid and shitty this game is.
[01:30.93]We're gonna play Sneak King.
[01:32.23]Like I'm a fucking toddler, like hiding.
[01:38.56]Behind the couch that's very visible and you can see where they go.
[01:41.62]You wanna play hide and seek?
[01:46.07]Yeah, you ready?
[01:47.39]Yeah, you're never going to be able to find me.
[01:49.83]They fucking run away.
[01:50.99]And you see them.
[01:51.73]You see exactly where they go.
[01:52.73]And then they jump out.
[01:54.33]You don't even have to find them.
[01:56.06]You get within a 15 feet circle around where they are.
[02:01.42]And they just jump out.
[02:02.20]And they go, ah!
[02:04.24]Like, yes, okay, you're very excited.
[02:05.70]I can tell.
[02:06.04]We're going to start with an Xbox 360 game.
[02:12.25]I don't know how good this is going to be, by the way.
[02:17.07]By the way, the rule does stand on this stream.
[02:19.89]The general rule.
[02:21.35]I don't know what the general rule is.
[02:24.67]We have 30 minutes to play each one of these.
[02:29.59]After 30 minutes, we decide if we're going to spend six hours.
[02:33.75]Kind of how it works.
[02:38.57]It's going to be great.
[02:43.92]That's a lot of gifts.
[02:45.90]That is a lot of gifts.
[02:46.78]That's 20.
[02:47.26]Oh, my throat is fucked today.
[02:57.76]What's going on?
[02:58.34]I don't know why this happens to me.
[03:04.18]Does anybody else feel like this?
[03:07.16]I have a like four hour window every single day where my voice is normal.
[03:15.37]After, like, 4 o'clock in the afternoon, it starts to get really kind of, like, tired.
[03:19.83]And from 4 in the afternoon till 1 a.m.
[03:23.21]before I go to bed, it's like, oh, man, like, I'm getting a little tired talking.
[03:27.22]I wake up in the morning.
[03:28.02]My voice is like this.
[03:30.22]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[03:31.00]And it slowly gets normal for, like, three hours.
[03:36.56]Why does it do this?
[03:37.50]What's wrong with me?
[03:42.53]I thought I was messed up for yelling for 20 minutes.
[03:44.27]Well, I didn't yell.
[03:45.51]Maybe I'm just screaming in my sleep or something.
[03:49.07]I was just like screaming every night and I don't even know.
[03:54.21]Stop talking to yourself.
[04:02.93]Smoker lungs.
[04:03.85]I don't smoke cigarettes.
[04:04.99]I don't even smoke weed.
[04:10.00]I don't do it.
[04:10.72]I don't inhale smoke.
[04:14.30]It's not a lie.
[04:15.00]It's not.
[04:15.36]I don't smoke weed.
[04:16.44]I already went over this.
[04:18.00]I don't smoke weed.
[04:19.74]I eat it.
[04:21.16]In small quantities.
[04:22.64]Controlled so I know exactly what I'm getting.
[04:24.97]I don't need to tell you all that again.
[04:27.43]I haven't caught a stream live in ages.
[04:34.59]Well, welcome.
[04:38.17]You're going to notice, I swear to God.
[04:40.33]So because we're on a once a week schedule, the like three to four hour stream is gone.
[04:48.15]I'm going to sit here as long as I'm comfortable.
[04:51.31]That could be five hours.
[04:52.73]That could be eight.
[04:53.61]I don't know.
[04:55.73]But something that you're going to notice over in real time here, you're going to find that four hour window.
[05:01.05]It's not right now.
[05:01.97]It's going to be in like 45 minutes to an hour.
[05:06.12]I want someone to catch it.
[05:09.89]Anyways, the first game I'm gonna play is the first Templar.
[05:14.40]For Xbox 360.
[05:19.16]I don't, this game, I don't know anything about it.
[05:21.54]This is a guy with a shield on the front and he has a sword.
[05:25.45]And... Wait, already nobody likes it?
[05:28.95]I haven't even played it yet.
[05:32.21]What was I gonna say?
[05:32.87]Somebody had, I had like, somebody had a question.
[05:37.90]What was I just gonna say?
[05:38.80]I have no idea.
[05:41.72]This game's bad?
[05:45.48]Really?
[05:46.28]You don't even, nobody even knows what this is.
[05:47.68]You don't know what this is?
[05:48.42]This looks like a PC, like, flip.
[05:55.19]Wait, what do you mean?
[05:56.29]I didn't catch the whole thing.
[05:58.67]Did you say this looks like a Unity flip?
[06:02.91]Is that what you said?
[06:05.53]Well, this would be one of the original Unity flips.
[06:09.24]Because this game came out before Unity, I think, even existed.
[06:15.46]I need to check the sound.
[06:16.46]I didn't get a chance to do that.
[06:17.50]Let's go.
[06:20.70]Ready?
[06:21.88]1, 2, 3.
[06:22.10]1, 2, 3.
[06:23.68]1, 2, 3.
[06:24.16]1, 2, 3.
[06:25.30]Is it good?
[06:30.31]Perfect.
[06:31.83]Alright, here we go.
[06:34.41]No game sound?
[06:35.19]I'm looking at it right now.
[06:35.93]I can see it.
[06:39.05]What the hell was I going to say?
[06:40.21]There was something important that I had to say.
[06:42.80]Cabbage Head PhD gave 25 community subs.
[06:45.06]I was in the middle of saying that.
[06:46.40]Thank you.
[06:47.16]What was I going to say?
[06:47.80]1, 2, 3.
[06:49.60]1, 2, 3.
[06:51.34]It should be instant when you hear it.
[06:54.76]I'm not going to play on casual.
[06:55.88]Maybe I should.
[06:56.44]I'm not playing on hard.
[07:03.22]Normal.
[07:04.22]Subtitles, sure.
[07:05.08]Why not?
[07:06.30]Brightness.
[07:06.80]Adjust the slider until the middle square is just barely visible.
[07:11.94]Does anybody play like this?
[07:12.96]I feel like there's tons of people that just turn the thing all the way up because I can see better.
[07:23.53]We're just going to go here.
[07:24.69]I hate not being able to see shit in games.
[07:26.03]It's annoying.
[07:26.35]Alright, you ready?
[07:28.77]Are you ready for the captivating story of the first temple?
[07:32.40]That was whatever.
[07:45.98]You have to wait 30 minutes.
[07:47.40]You can't just say next.
[07:49.66]We haven't even seen the intro.
[07:52.23]Sit down.
[07:55.27]During the First Crusade, the armies of Europe seized Jerusalem.
[08:01.15]Peasant and lord alike fled to the Holy Land in search of fortune or salvation.
[08:07.44]Nine war knights joined forces to protect the countless pilgrims in Outremer.
[08:13.63]For nearly two centuries, the brotherhood they started grew in power and wealth.
[08:20.48]Everyone is waiting for Sneak King.
[08:23.10]What if I just fucked with you all and I had this game custom made?
[08:25.84]And it zooms into the king on the throne and it's the Burger King.
[08:29.98]See, that's how you don't, you don't even know what the fuck you're gonna get here.
[08:31.95]So sit down!
[08:35.29]Of how it was found and how it was lost.
[08:40.78]I play this game?
[08:41.50]This guy just woke up.
[08:42.58]I know what it's like.
[09:07.29]who come after me can tell if I was right or wrong.
[09:13.07]Let's catch up with this guy in like four hours.
[09:14.73]He probably sounds like this.
[09:16.01]I dedicate my life to finding the Holy Grail.
[09:19.72]After years of research... It's the human starting zone in Warcraft?
[09:23.96]I left my home in Mont Seguin to seek a meeting with the Templar Grandmaster.
[09:30.20]Can you hear that?
[09:32.20]Not only as my god, but also as my friend.
[09:36.87]It sounds like I'm changing ink in my printer over here.
[09:45.01]The toughness skill grants orbs.
[09:52.35]You can't hear that?
[09:54.59]Cyprus, 1291.
[09:56.09]It is a Unity flip, you're right.
[10:05.59]This looks like a machinima.
[10:07.45]This looks like a very well-made machinima.
[10:14.67]Let's go.
[10:15.59]The chateau.
[10:16.35]Wait, somebody killed all these people?
[10:27.97]Why are they ready to... We bring you no money.
[10:32.39]We bring you swords.
[10:38.15]Why would you close your hands together?
[10:41.82]Alright, X is attack.
[10:45.04]Nice.
[10:47.30]This is the best machinima I've ever seen.
[10:51.33]Who's talking?
[10:54.79]Me?
[10:55.13]Okay.
[10:56.27]Oh, this game is not going to be very fun.
[10:58.21]This is going to be gone in a half hour, I guarantee it.
[11:02.38]Playing in a machinima.
[11:03.92]What, you don't remember that?
[11:07.11]If you didn't feel like setting all the characters up and stuff, you would go from a cinematic view to just take the HUD away and start fucking slashing at each other and stuff.
[11:16.76]And you'd use that, because how much of a pain in the ass would that be?
[11:20.32]To actually set all that up.
[11:21.14]Alright, what do I need to do?
[11:25.06]Is there a sprint?
[11:36.44]What do I have to do?
[11:38.24]Just leave?
[11:45.16]Castle Griffinsteed 2.
[11:50.73]Oh, here we go.
[11:51.27]Alright.
[11:51.59]You can block enemy attacks by holding down right trigger.
[11:53.53]To block an attack coming from a different direction, tilt L in that direction while holding RT down.
[12:04.66]Alright.
[12:05.28]That's a block.
[12:10.46]I just need, like, a young, like, 12-year-old voice to narrate what's going on right now.
[12:14.67]And then it would be a real machinima.
[12:18.35]Alright, block.
[12:21.99]With a really puffy mic.
[12:24.59]What I mean by puffy mic, I mean that every time you say the word, any word with P or T in it, it sounds like your eardrums are blowing up.
[12:33.33]For example, I'm going to give you a warning here.
[12:36.90]This is going to be horrible.
[12:37.84]Okay, so...
[12:50.26]Please, please take me to your general so I can push him over the edge.
[12:57.50]That's what it was like.
[12:59.16]That's still kind of what it's like.
[13:00.08]I'm sorry, that's probably loud.
[13:00.90]Call the golden arrow on your minimap to your main objective.
[13:04.43]The minimap is located in the upper left corner of your screen.
[13:08.47]Alright, let's go.
[13:11.41]Put a filter on?
[13:12.89]Maybe I will eventually.
[13:16.54]You...
[13:22.76]This game is so... Ugly.
[13:26.94]But, like, I'm still interested.
[13:28.99]I'm not giving up yet.
[13:30.45]I'm not.
[13:30.79]Next game.
[13:31.51]Wait a minute.
[13:31.97]Just give me a minute.
[13:32.63]Let me just do like the fucking 12-year-old does up his shit.
[13:34.97]I'm a joke.
[13:35.37]And then we'll move on to Sneak King.
[13:36.83]I guarantee it.
[13:46.41]Play a Lego game?
[13:48.99]The dots, orange dots in your minimap represent healing items.
[13:52.09]They contain food or fresh water.
[13:53.37]Did I go Lord of the Rings?
[14:01.38]I think a lot of people don't know what one of the next games could be.
[14:06.50]And yes, I did make sure they were all backwards compatible.
[14:09.40]You're out of your mind.
[14:10.52]You go in.
[14:12.16]I'm not dying here.
[14:18.56]It has to be, like, this game's gonna be fun, right?
[14:25.09]Willhelm screams.
[14:29.89]Yo, I got an achievement playing the game and not doing anything.
[14:32.61]Holy shit, wow, like, what you're witnessing right now is, like, the achievement bubble of 2011 or 2008.
[14:40.42]Everything was an achievement.
[14:45.62]Nothing was a real achievement.
[14:52.99]challenges, beating the game on hard or something, or doing something really crazy, some real achievement.
[14:57.69]Nope.
[14:58.19]Achievement bubble 2009.
[14:58.95]You drank a potion for the first time.
[15:02.95]100 points.
[15:04.91]And then it crashed hard.
[15:08.76]We don't even care about him anymore.
[15:11.02]What is going on here?
[15:13.12]I came to Cyprus to meet the French king's messenger.
[15:17.00]The Antioch butchers captured him.
[15:19.14]I don't know how.
[15:21.43]I'm not listening to any of this.
[15:30.15]I miss my beloved Xbox.
[15:33.89]A lot of 360s play most Xbox games.
[15:42.78]We must free the messenger.
[15:44.97]What's my gamer score?
[15:45.86]I don't know.
[15:47.08]Not that high.
[15:47.66]Gamer score is -2.
[15:49.08]Open your dashboard?
[15:51.32]How do I see it?
[15:52.68]It's not just like right here.
[16:16.89]Left?
[16:20.14]Hold on, I don't want you to see, what if like my credit card comes up or something?
[16:22.96]Hold on, I don't want you to see that.
[16:24.60]I don't want you guys to see my credit card info.
[16:31.76]But wait, no, no, would I even care?
[16:33.19]The last credit card I put into this was from like, probably like four years ago or something.
[16:39.97]Do I really care?
[16:40.53]Alright, I got 3800 points, is that good?
[16:48.09]3825.
[16:50.19]What was considered a huge gamer score?
[16:55.69]Well, let me put it this way.
[16:56.59]What was a braggable gamer score?
[17:00.68]200k?
[17:01.86]20k plus?
[17:07.36]50k plus?
[17:09.12]Damn.
[17:13.09]Well, cool.
[17:14.83]Let's continue with the story.
[17:18.62]That's another 25 subs from Cabbagehead.
[17:21.94]Thank you, Cabbagehead, for the insane subs.
[17:23.84]50 community subs.
[17:24.78]Alright, it's time for a prediction.
[17:25.66]Is there a mod here that can do predictions?
[17:26.88]Will the guy on my left in the next cutscene
[17:49.19]Do the, like, I'm gonna give you a beatdown with his hands.
[17:52.35]Like this.
[17:53.03]Like he was doing.
[17:53.58]He did it twice.
[17:54.30]Will he do it a third time in the next cutscene?
[18:01.32]Get it up there.
[18:01.76]Let's see it.
[18:02.46]I wanna see.
[18:02.84]Uh, you can't even kill NPCs in this game.
[18:13.51]Game's not even any good.
[18:14.41]Alright Alright, let's go.
[18:18.53]That's easy money.
[18:24.06]You can spend XP earned in battle to unlock new skills for your heroes.
[18:28.04]Open the journal to learn new skills.
[18:30.56]Alright, let's see.
[18:31.24]Are they any good?
[18:35.23]Lenny the person, 25 community subs.
[18:36.93]Oh my god.
[18:38.95]That's another 25 subs.
[18:44.85]Alright, will he do it?
[18:47.59]Win channel points if you make the correct prediction.
[18:50.67]The Xbox fucking sucks.
[18:51.92]Actually, the Xbox was fantastic.
[18:57.16]The original Xbox was insane.
[18:59.30]The Xbox 360, on the other hand, melted in your house all the time.
[19:08.11]Do people remember that shit?
[19:09.45]I think a lot of the younger crowd here might not understand.
[19:13.31]The Xbox 360...
[19:16.53]There was just a random, like, probably 20% chance that it would brick itself and die and melt inside.
[19:23.96]That was not... Oh, wow, that's crazy!
[19:27.81]Imagine if the PS5 just fucking melted inside.
[19:32.06]Like, 30% of them.
[19:36.67]Wrap it up in a towel.
[19:37.59]Yeah, and remember the videos of the people opening up the heatsink?
[19:41.23]Like turning on an Xbox and opening the heatsink up and dropping like an egg in there?
[19:45.30]And just cooking the egg instantly and it was made like a fucking souffle?
[19:48.82]I remember that video.
[19:51.44]That's fucking crazy.
[19:52.34]Alright, what do I want?
[19:55.68]How much?
[19:56.50]I have 1000 XP.
[19:58.58]Alright, am I gonna go... The third attack in this combo can knock down enemies or break their shields.
[20:03.71]Boring.
[20:04.13]Boring.
[20:06.25]I like that one.
[20:06.79]That's a cleave.
[20:09.36]Granted, additional zeal orb.
[20:10.74]Don't care what that is.
[20:11.56]We're not going to get far enough into the game to know what that is or care about it.
[20:13.82]Yeah, this one.
[20:17.44]Alright, let's go.
[20:21.94]Are they orcs?
[20:22.44]Well, how come we don't have a horse?
[20:23.52]Why don't we have a horse?
[20:25.06]Didn't people ride horses?
[20:39.77]How come everyone's just walking around?
[20:40.93]Enemy archers can deal severe damage from a distance.
[20:44.30]If you see a targeting mark near you, try to move away from it.
[20:47.58]Hold LT down and tilt L in the desired direction.
[20:53.84]Hold LT- Oh, alright, so this is dodge.
[21:02.35]This game reminds me of something.
[21:03.79]Uh, do you guys remember the Viking game?
[21:08.13]Viking.
[21:12.40]No, there is a mobile game that's like this.
[21:14.68]What's this fucking mobile game?
[21:16.30]There's a mobile game that's this exact game.
[21:19.23]I played it for like two straight days.
[21:20.89]And then I was like, ah, I'm never playing.
[21:21.97]It's a game where you only fight guys like this in an arena.
[21:26.41]Not Infinity Blade.
[21:27.15]No, it's something else.
[21:32.39]No, not Clash of Clans.
[21:37.39]Blood and Glory.
[21:38.13]That's definitely it.
[21:39.21]You are absolutely correct.
[21:40.77]How did you get that?
[21:41.43]You're right.
[21:49.01]Wait, there's someone here.
[21:52.19]Blood and Glory, yeah.
[21:54.49]It's a mobile game.
[21:59.59]You know, usually I would be really happy if mobile games have caught up.
[22:04.20]Because remember back in like, I don't know, 2012, 2013, 14, having a 3D game on your phone was a huge deal.
[22:12.20]So, if phones are able to make games that look like this now, that's a really huge, awesome technological achievement.
[22:19.65]It really is.
[22:21.19]But they also, like, progressed.
[22:23.13]Instead of it being, like, mobile games that are, like, just 10 years behind permanently...
[22:28.02]They were making their own mobile, like, core engine shit.
[22:33.08]And it's, like, paying $5 to not have to wait 10 minutes to play the next level and shit.
[22:38.39]If mobile games just didn't ever do that, I think they would have, like, been... Well, they are huge.
[22:42.69]But... And they're huge because, like, it just preys on, like, gambling and fucking people's, like, need to not... Impatience and shit.
[22:49.09]But what I mean is if it just stayed like this... If it was just 10 years behind, that would be awesome.
[23:00.98]Where am I going?
[23:03.44]They make the most money.
[23:04.42]I know it's just an obscene market.
[23:06.72]I know.
[23:10.71]But if they just made games on it with the technology and not just at the same time developed the vampire parasite neck bite that is all mobile gaming mechanics, I think I would have liked it a lot more.
[23:24.85]Brutal Templar Strike.
[23:27.67]A powerful version of the Templar Strike.
[23:29.23]Who cares?
[23:31.51]Is there a jump?
[23:39.66]There are some mobile games that are actually really fun too.
[23:44.40]Alright.
[23:52.65]XXX breaks shields.
[23:55.51]Okay, so it's been 25 minutes.
[23:56.95]I have five minutes to do something interesting.
[24:02.97]Or, uh, we're gonna have to move on.
[24:05.53]Because this is just... Like a really... You know what this makes me want to play?
[24:10.87]This makes me want to play Shadow of War.
[24:12.23]I mean, what do you mean not enough?
[24:21.19]We need a cutscene.
[24:22.36]Oh shit, that's right!
[24:23.16]I was about to just exit the game!
[24:26.32]I forgot about the stupid prediction.
[24:31.88]We do need a cutscene, that's right.
[24:33.36]After the next cutscene, maybe we'll get out of here.
[24:35.24]And we'll put out a Sneak King.
[24:36.84]Because I'm going to play that for 20 minutes, you know it.
[24:38.64]And then, holy shit, I got a big one for you.
[24:43.40]I got a lot of Xbox and Xbox 360 games.
[24:45.84]Why is... Why is that so hard?
[24:51.81]Why was it... Who's... Is this talking?
[24:56.33]Who's talking to me?
[25:00.29]Why is this guy doing a Batman voice?
[25:01.81]That's just Batman.
[25:05.51]Alright, Brutal Templar Strike.
[25:13.35]I don't have enough mana.
[25:19.99]Which is stupid.
[25:25.11]You have to play Halo.
[25:25.97]I'm not gonna play Halo.
[25:30.00]I don't like Halo, alright?
[25:31.70]Just, can we give that a rest finally, forever?
[25:34.17]I don't like the game Halo.
[25:36.31]I don't like the game.
[25:39.19]I'm sorry.
[25:40.09]I know everyone's gonna be really mad at me.
[25:41.89]I don't like Halo.
[25:43.51]It's just, I don't like it.
[25:45.93]It's not that I hate it.
[25:46.83]I just don't enjoy playing it.
[25:51.49]And when you are met with the perspective here, of... There's like five Halo games...
[25:59.08]And everyone expects you to play them.
[26:00.62]I'm gonna die.
[26:06.26]You got your Halo stream when me and Joel played it.
[26:08.55]And then that was it.
[26:12.55]It's never happening again.
[26:13.43]Will you just kill him?
[26:17.92]It's based gamer cringe.
[26:23.35]Look, I know Halo, there's a big bunch of fans.
[26:27.22]It's got a lot of support.
[26:29.44]It's considered a very, very good shooter.
[26:31.42]I know.
[26:33.76]But we don't all have to like the same things.
[26:37.74]No opponents can make special, more devastating attacks.
[26:45.48]The Super Axe.
[26:47.68]Yes, we do.
[26:48.56]No, we don't.
[26:52.11]Look, if everybody liked the same things, then you wouldn't be able to go watch a movie, love it, and then go hate read the 30% Rotten Tomatoes critic article about the movie.
[27:04.00]You wouldn't be able to do that anymore.
[27:05.02]Alright, uh, watch for these icons, try to block or dodge.
[27:11.05]You got it.
[27:15.59]No cutscene.
[27:16.17]No, not yet.
[27:18.51]Where's this mercenary leader?
[27:22.88]Leader?
[27:23.14]No, this is the leader.
[27:27.24]Here come more of my boys.
[27:32.62]Oh, shit.
[27:35.85]There they are.
[27:36.53]There they are.
[27:37.13]The boys.
[27:37.59]Uh-oh.
[27:43.15]I'm going to die.
[27:44.85]Where's their drink fountain?
[27:48.41]It's the boys.
[27:49.66]Isn't that from Warhammer?
[27:50.42]Warhammer?
[27:56.76]Boston oh my god kill him reload has been knocked out What do you mean real go to the knocked out character perform the revive action to help them You don't help your fallen teammate in time.
[28:09.66]You will lose the game what?
[28:17.93]How the fuck am I supposed to revive him I Can't revive him
[28:28.91]Not enough zeal?
[28:29.89]Did I get him?
[28:33.27]Look at this fucking bubble.
[28:34.89]Are you kidding me?
[28:46.65]Ah!
[28:47.47]What?
[28:51.58]Cutscene?
[28:53.30]Oh, cutscene!
[29:02.44]I said open it, you fucking psycho!
[29:04.84]It's high time you showed up.
[29:09.16]Are you well, my lady?
[29:10.98]That door sucks.
[29:15.16]You could lean a vacuum against that door and it would fall over.
[29:18.04]Really?
[29:18.82]Oh, it was very kind of them to capture me at my request.
[29:23.44]He's gonna do it.
[29:27.19]I was in the Outremer.
[29:28.81]The Saracens were minutes away and the Butchers had a ship.
[29:32.98]He did it!
[29:34.19]Yes!
[29:35.47]How could you bet against one of his four animations?
[29:40.85]How dare you?
[29:42.77]What are you thinking?
[29:43.99]Guy de Boulogne.
[29:55.96]Why the seagulls?
[29:57.56]Is somebody like 15 feet to the right of us?
[29:59.82]Who has like a burger basket from the boardwalk at the beach?
[30:02.96]And there's just seagulls just fucking attacking this guy.
[30:25.38]Get away from me!
[30:26.38]These are my french fries!
[30:28.40]Ow!
[30:30.26]No!
[30:31.88]Honey, honey!
[30:33.28]Get him off me!
[30:35.34]He like throws the basket of food to get away and run.
[30:38.90]Otherwise he's gonna get murdered.
[30:39.88]Why are we coming back here?
[30:47.90]Oh, it's been 30 minutes.
[30:54.80]She might help.
[30:56.39]Honey, save yourself.
[30:58.97]We have to.
[30:59.95]We need to leave Cyprus immediately.
[31:02.73]Honey, get the kids!
[31:04.57]Take a full squadron of knights.
[31:06.09]No, the order stays out of this.
[31:09.48]The Templars cannot attack the church.
[31:11.76]Next game?
[31:12.68]No, not yet.
[31:14.14]Good.
[31:15.18]No point in waiting for a farewell party, then.
[31:21.37]Wait, we have a new area.
[31:22.29]No, not yet.
[31:22.53]Just give me a minute.
[31:23.15]Congratulations.
[31:23.57]16 million.
[31:23.83]Going across to 1,700 people.
[31:24.78]You guys can't hear that.
[31:25.32]Really?
[31:25.48]Are you sure?
[31:25.76]Finish this game.
[31:26.16]I'm not going to... No.
[31:55.58]By the way, I also had the Burger King bumper cars game.
[32:00.50]But I think I threw it in the trash accidentally.
[32:02.94]I actually think I threw it away.
[32:04.20]Because I don't know.
[32:04.91]I can't find it.
[32:06.29]Find and slay the beast.
[32:09.15]We have to see who the beast is, right?
[32:12.45]Kill the beast.
[32:14.13]Yes.
[32:15.33]No, I'm sorry.
[32:15.81]We're not going anywhere.
[32:16.57]Not yet.
[32:17.17]It's never that simple.
[32:23.70]That owl sounds strange.
[32:25.34]No, guys, don't worry.
[32:26.03]I'm not like a three to four hour Andy anymore.
[32:28.39]Like, I'm doing once a week streams.
[32:31.11]I'm here.
[32:32.27]We got time.
[32:32.77]Don't worry.
[32:41.56]The bridge is down.
[32:44.70]Our options are limited, it seems.
[32:46.98]What, the racing one?
[32:48.80]I thought I had two or three of them.
[32:50.08]Do you expect an ambush?
[32:52.25]I certainly hope for one.
[32:58.23]Oh, that was a bird noise.
[33:02.63]Bon Ilyas.
[33:04.47]The way the French fry it.
[33:07.16]Seagulls.
[33:08.36]Surround it.
[33:11.22]Did he fall off?
[33:11.80]I don't know.
[33:17.58]Take cover.
[33:17.80]Arrows from across the river.
[33:25.88]They seem to be done.
[33:30.24]They've ran out.
[33:34.51]Look out!
[33:35.41]They used all their arrows in one volley.
[33:42.65]I once got to get hit right in the head with an arrow.
[33:44.25]Don't you?
[33:45.54]Won't this make it worth it?
[33:46.38]It'll make everything worth it, won't it?
[33:49.13]If an arrow goes through his neck and gives him Frankenstein bolts, this would be worth it.
[33:54.12]Ow, fuck, it hit me.
[33:58.68]Come on.
[33:59.94]Please, just hit this guy in the neck with an arrow.
[34:01.82]That's all I want.
[34:03.20]I gotta try to stand right next to him so it can't hit me.
[34:16.96]God damn it!
[34:17.62]No, hit him!
[34:18.74]He's in the fucking way!
[34:20.00]Why are they hitting me first?
[34:21.74]He's standing in front of me!
[34:28.21]Shoot him!
[34:30.43]He got him.
[34:39.73]They keep hitting us in the chest.
[34:41.72]Fuck, I missed it.
[34:42.44]Did we see it?
[34:49.53]What's this?
[34:49.99]Eat berries?
[34:50.89]You don't eat random berries.
[34:52.04]You don't know where they... Alright, can you imagine being one of these archers?
[35:00.32]And you've watched four arrows connect through this guy's chest and stomach and stuff and he's still running up here?
[35:07.20]Dogs.
[35:08.24]Why are dogs just unfriendly?
[35:15.78]Help me!
[35:24.23]Why is he dead?
[35:25.41]They're not dead.
[35:31.96]They're playing dead.
[35:37.23]A chest by an open fire.
[35:47.30]Brutal Frenzy Boon.
[35:48.38]Until the end of this chapter, Roland has been granted Brutal Frenzy, a powerful version of the Frenzy skill.
[35:53.40]Frenzy gives Roland a damage boost.
[35:56.95]This is the shittiest chests I've ever seen in a video game.
[36:00.27]You're telling me that inside of these chests are motivational notes?
[36:08.14]Who's the fucking asshole that did that?
[36:12.94]There's no gold pieces, potions, armor, jewels.
[36:17.11]No.
[36:18.71]It's motivational poetry.
[36:21.35]They're fortune cookie chests.
[36:34.97]Lodge by the road.
[36:36.95]People there will know what's going on.
[36:38.75]Well, at least spin the paper around and see what your lucky numbers are.
[36:41.41]Wait, these are villagers?
[36:47.65]Well, he's... What?
[36:50.11]What do you mean judgmental?
[36:54.76]Where are my coins?
[36:55.70]I think he didn't bet on that.
[37:07.84]That guy's way closer to his microphone than everybody else in the whole game.
[37:13.50]Okay.
[37:36.87]This is a frosty king.
[37:37.96]Are there choices?
[37:43.32]Alright, are there choices?
[37:47.23]There are no choices in this game.
[37:49.29]Too bad.
[37:55.41]Next game?
[37:56.01]I'm not going next game until we beat the beast.
[37:59.09]Whoever the beast is.
[38:00.27]It's supposed to be this big, giant, mythical creature.
[38:02.93]But it's going to be just kind of a big guy with a flail.
[38:07.36]That's who the beast is, in quotes.
[38:16.86]$50,000 says I can do more trivia than you.
[38:22.51]hundred thousand dollars ninety thousand dollars says I'm faster than you oh yeah beasts I I graduated from Yale bring it on and they get every question wrong I want to kill these dogs
[38:50.71]I don't think I was alive for a second.
[38:51.90]I thought, okay.
[38:53.28]There's a skeleton in here.
[39:07.49]Let me do the talking.
[39:08.77]Don't give up, skeleton.
[39:14.99]Read sign.
[39:16.87]Oh, it's going to be like, this is my chest.
[39:18.81]Please don't steal.
[39:30.38]Here we go.
[39:32.01]Here comes drama.
[39:34.31]Welcome, Templars.
[39:36.07]Have you seen the beast?
[39:37.69]Is it near you?
[39:39.39]No, we haven't.
[39:40.57]Though we are looking for it.
[39:42.86]You're mad.
[39:44.32]Be glad you're safe and sound here.
[39:46.42]I like this game.
[39:47.36]We can take care of ourselves.
[39:50.04]Why are there so many animals in here?
[39:54.93]The beast slaughters anyone in sight.
[39:57.49]No, no, no.
[39:58.21]That's... Excuse me.
[39:59.91]That's like go-to-bed relaxation sounds.
[40:06.18]I'm waiting for the... Wait till they start playing the ocean one.
[40:09.16]Or the light thunderstorm.
[40:10.50]He's here.
[40:12.44]Where?
[40:27.47]Wait, let me skip to the chase here.
[40:29.77]How many legs does the beast have?
[40:32.70]Two!
[40:33.30]He has two legs!
[40:35.54]He has two legs!
[40:36.58]He doesn't want you to come over, he does not want you to come fight him, and he does not care!
[40:41.68]Mr. Parrot!
[40:45.18]It's gonna be a person, it's not gonna be an animal.
[40:49.16]What creature can do that?
[40:52.41]It's gonna be a human with a flail.
[40:54.41]Oh wow, it's a beast.
[40:56.85]We've seen this movie 5,000 times.
[41:00.86]Track the beast to its lair.
[41:03.90]Look around.
[41:06.92]Oh.
[41:10.88]Oh, what's in here?
[41:11.48]Jewels?
[41:14.20]You have found a health boon.
[41:15.79]You'll have one additional health orb until the end of this level.
[41:19.15]Just because you say it doesn't mean it's real.
[41:29.86]It's a guy.
[41:30.72]That's a guy.
[41:31.42]I hope they use that.
[41:42.76]Please use it.
[41:44.52]That's my favorite sound.
[41:45.52]This guy's gonna be 12 stone.
[42:02.88]Okay, here comes the guy.
[42:05.54]Alright.
[42:06.58]Prediction time.
[42:07.26]Let's have you guys spend a little bit of money.
[42:10.90]Is the beast an animal?
[42:13.58]Yes or no?
[42:15.73]Is the beast an animal?
[42:19.33]Or monster?
[42:20.25]Let me fix this.
[42:22.75]Is the beast humanoid?
[42:25.13]Like a human or like a human creature?
[42:29.36]Is it like a bear?
[42:31.28]Is the beast a bear?
[42:32.78]Is that better?
[42:34.52]How do I word this the best so the semantics people don't get mad at me?
[42:43.69]Is the beast a guy?
[42:47.09]Humanoid or beast?
[42:48.35]Alright, that's a good one.
[42:49.31]Is it... No, no, no.
[42:50.65]It has to be yes or no.
[42:56.31]Does it have more than two legs?
[42:58.91]Okay, that's good.
[43:00.53]Bipedal.
[43:01.75]That's the one.
[43:03.28]No, because you could be like a stand-up bear walking around with your hands.
[43:06.72]No, no, no.
[43:08.80]More than two legs.
[43:09.34]I don't think that's fair.
[43:13.29]Humanoid.
[43:13.93]Is the beast humanoid?
[43:15.85]Done.
[43:16.47]That's what it is.
[43:25.62]It's human.
[43:27.36]Humanoid is subjective.
[43:28.69]Alright, is the beast human?
[43:31.91]Yes or no?
[43:33.69]Why are we complicating this?
[43:35.97]You guys just stand to lose a shitload of money.
[43:37.85]Does it matter?
[43:38.37]Does the beast have feathers?
[43:42.97]It's just a big bird.
[43:51.38]Being a human is subjective.
[43:55.90]Please.
[43:57.92]Alright, is the beast human?
[44:01.47]Is the beast human, yes or no?
[44:03.97]I like that.
[44:04.95]Wait, I don't want to give away any spoilers.
[44:06.75]Because that guy next to me could be like, oh yeah, that sounds just like the wolves in my town.
[44:12.62]Is the beast human?
[44:32.36]Does the beast come from... What do you mean by human?
[44:44.69]Alright, here we go.
[44:50.18]Does the beast... Feel?
[44:54.42]Oh, the beast's lair.
[44:55.18]Okay, this is like a castle.
[45:00.13]ambush the beast here yeah we're gonna jump out it's gonna be a guy holding firewood walking back with a big axe or something he's gonna be big guy right he's gonna be holding firewood walking slowly with the firewood and we're gonna realize it's a human that's what's gonna happen that's like a big guy is that a guy that's a big guy right
[45:28.79]That's just a huge guy.
[45:31.19]What is it?
[45:34.77]Is it a guy?
[45:35.31]That's just a guy.
[45:37.71]It's just a big, huge... Wait, don't close the prediction yet.
[45:50.78]We don't know.
[45:53.66]We can't tell yet.
[45:54.61]I don't know if this is a human or not.
[46:01.28]Not human, but it could be.
[46:02.76]What if it is?
[46:03.40]We don't know.
[46:03.86]You don't know that yet.
[46:04.66]Let's wait till he talks.
[46:11.33]It's a troll.
[46:12.31]You don't know what it is yet.
[46:13.21]We don't know.
[46:13.65]It's just the beast right now.
[46:15.85]We're gonna bring him down to like 10% health.
[46:18.85]And we're gonna get like a fucking Psycho Mantis monolog.
[46:22.41]Just wait.
[46:35.59]I didn't even knock him down!
[46:36.43]That was him!
[46:38.71]Get the fuck off me!
[46:49.06]How could you hate dogs?
[46:57.74]See, who's dead?
[47:02.86]Pump?
[47:03.78]Why does that say- What do you mean, pump?
[47:07.02]I can't revive him.
[47:08.04]Hurry!
[47:08.44]I need to revive him!
[47:11.19]How do I build up my meter?
[47:12.19]Oh my god, he stomped on me!
[47:19.27]Revive him!
[47:20.61]I need to revive that guy!
[47:22.83]He's gonna die!
[47:23.63]How do I build my meter?
[47:39.00]Oh my god, he's gonna die.
[47:40.42]How much time do I have before he... is dead?
[47:50.76]Wait, what?
[47:54.64]Where are we restarting from?
[47:55.86]He's human.
[47:56.18]I don't know!
[47:56.64]Wait, what do you mean?
[47:57.40]Do I have to start all the way back here?
[48:10.39]No, we don't.
[48:13.40]He's a troll.
[48:14.50]I need to beat him so we can confirm that.
[48:16.24]Let's go.
[48:18.12]He's a pretty one.
[48:19.18]The Beast.
[48:20.52]This could be just a guy.
[48:23.94]It's very possible this is a guy.
[48:27.42]Like, yeah, the witch.
[48:28.86]The witch in the woods turned me into this.
[48:30.61]I didn't want to be like this, fellas.
[48:31.95]It was the witch and her dark heart.
[48:51.59]He's stuck.
[48:53.93]Watch out for the dogs.
[48:55.77]You good?
[48:56.09]Can I block?
[49:04.20]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[49:09.52]Get up.
[49:16.02]Ooh.
[49:16.52]Ooh.
[49:22.66]Counter!
[49:29.42]He's angry.
[49:29.94]Uh-oh.
[49:31.76]Ah, you mammoth.
[49:32.92]Right?
[49:33.12]He didn't say die, troll.
[49:43.39]Oh my god, he's gonna die.
[49:44.49]Can I revive him?
[49:48.15]Come on, I gotta revive him and go southbound.
[49:51.25]Give me a break.
[49:56.33]Not enough.
[49:56.99]I have a full one.
[50:01.07]Watch out for the dogs.
[50:11.88]He's stuck!
[50:12.28]Get him!
[50:12.50]He's stuck!
[50:20.02]Knocked down!
[50:21.82]Okay, here we go.
[50:22.40]This is it.
[50:27.40]Alright, who is he?
[50:28.64]He's like the butcher in the town.
[50:30.58]He's like the barber or something.
[50:34.43]What is it?
[50:35.81]Oh!
[50:50.57]No way!
[50:51.73]He said it!
[50:52.77]That's canon in the game.
[50:54.77]He's human.
[50:56.58]He's human.
[50:57.36]He didn't say troll.
[50:58.28]He didn't say ogre.
[50:59.22]He said human.
[51:01.34]Game over.
[51:06.68]Oh man, that's unfortunate that he said human.
[51:16.78]Can I go in?
[51:17.41]It is blocked.
[51:22.82]I broke.
[51:24.84]He was making all those kinds of like troll noises too.
[51:27.35]I'm so sorry everybody, but it was confirmed in game that he was a human.
[51:34.71]Game sucks.
[51:35.37]Next game now.
[51:37.23]Look, we can, you can be... You can be mad and annoyed.
[51:44.36]Hold on, not yet.
[51:53.30]I don't have my fill of this game yet.
[51:58.30]Oh, Jesus.
[51:59.86]He just got crushed.
[52:08.93]That was a really weird cut.
[52:11.99]That was anime intro cut.
[52:15.40]That was right before the breakdown.
[52:16.98]That's when it's like...
[52:23.90]like the next part with like this shows like the animated fighting and stuff oh why do you hate us so much I'm enjoying my video game called templars I don't know what it's called melting in my seat watching this you're fine you're fine turn the ac on

[52:57.86]Ow!

[54:07.72]Oh my god, I hate this part.
[54:10.62]Get him off me!
[54:11.24]Alright, the next chapter I'm done.
[54:18.06]I don't know, I'm having fun.
[54:19.23]Where's your clues?
[54:30.07]Something may be hidden nearby.
[54:32.32]Keep your eyes open.
[54:33.46]Something may be hidden.
[54:34.68]Oh, no.
[54:35.12]We have to find the hidden chest.
[54:38.50]Please stop playing this game.
[54:39.70]I beg you.
[54:43.20]Begging me?
[54:44.14]You're begging me to stop playing?
[54:46.62]I'm sorry.
[54:49.99]There are no negotiations right now.
[54:52.59]There is no such thing as a negotiation right now.
[54:56.07]We've crossed the 30-minute mark, which means I'll be here for six hours.
[54:59.87]That's how this game works.
[55:01.53]Just kidding.
[55:03.28]Don't take that seriously, please.
[55:05.08]If you do, then I don't know what to tell you.
[55:06.76]I don't know what I can do to tell you.
[55:08.06]This is where we're going to find out who the bad guy of the game is.
[55:16.10]We're going to find out who the beast was, right?
[55:18.78]He was cursed by a witch, by a warlock.
[55:25.54]And they're cursing people in the town, turning them into humans, monsters.
[55:36.29]You're wrong.
[55:38.11]No monster stands a chance against our swords.
[55:44.76]I'm not going to complete the game.
[55:46.04]I have to play Sneaking for at least 20 minutes.
[55:51.00]There's an old but trusty sword.
[55:53.10]You take it.
[55:55.27]100% platinum.
[56:02.14]Trying to pawn off a rusty blade.
[56:03.50]That voice.
[56:05.84]I love this voice.
[56:06.76]He sounds like somebody.
[56:10.56]A Disney character.
[56:28.94]Oh, go to the outfit screen.
[56:36.30]Amplify uniform.
[56:40.43]Commander arms.
[56:42.21]Collect all pieces to unlock the weapon.
[56:44.17]Do I even have this?
[56:49.53]I don't... 50 gifted subs.
[56:55.67]Holy shit, from Zyxia.
[57:01.20]Thanks for the 50... 50... community subs.
[57:05.40]Do I have to fight them?
[57:09.33]I don't even have to fight them.
[57:21.79]Can't leave?
[57:31.47]Well, I think I may have just messed everything up here.
[57:41.13]Say something funny.
[57:42.01]Alright.
[57:42.27]I just switched characters and... I switched characters and revived... What?
[57:51.55]Alright, so I have to revive him now.
[58:06.34]Who sent you?
[58:12.92]My brother will kill you.
[58:14.61]Don't try him.
[58:22.11]Isn't the one-eyed man, isn't that Bigfoot?
[58:27.07]That person doesn't exist.
[58:27.67]God help me.
[58:38.21]Why use that there?
[58:43.55]Why put that there of all the places?
[58:45.89]It was such a weird place to put that.
[59:01.46]Spugelberry.
[59:02.24]Excuse me.
[59:03.76]Good day, brothers.
[59:05.98]The abbey is closed.
[59:08.05]Here it comes.
[59:08.59]This audio seems... They're all talking from weird directions.
[59:37.88]We demand to speak to Brother Lorenzo.
[59:40.50]The sanctuary is not a place for warriors with swords.
[59:44.58]Our swords have slain the beast, lifted the curse of this blessing away.
[59:49.97]Wonderful news.
[59:51.91]Praise God.
[59:53.55]It's so loud.
[59:54.79]Very well.
[59:56.31]Take the boat to the abbey and inform Brother Lorenzo of this miracle.
[60:01.77]Truly, the Lord works in wondrous ways.
[60:06.59]Sound mixing.
[60:07.15]Yeah, the sound mixing is very bad.
[60:08.93]At last, we were in the Abbey of Saint-Jacques, where we were told a certain Marie de Balin was being held against her will.
[60:17.38]As praying Dominican monks did their best to ignore us, I wondered whether this was because we were intruding on their seclusion, or because they had something to hide.
[60:27.68]I... I...
[60:32.50]Yeah, no.
[60:36.00]Before, I would have been doing it three or four hours ago.
[60:47.78]Speak to Brother Lorenzo.
[60:51.40]Wait, one of you guys Brother Lorenzo?
[60:52.68]No.
[60:53.18]Alright, I'm almost done.
[60:54.06]I promise.
[60:56.90]There really is Geralt.
[60:59.24]That's who it was.
[61:07.29]Oh, hurry up.
[61:11.57]Where's Lorenzo?
[61:12.13]Don't touch that.
[61:15.35]Don't touch stuff.
[61:18.19]I'm not going to sit here and listen to a thousand years of lore.
[61:31.10]Where's the sermon?
[61:34.68]This is very mediocre.
[61:37.11]Well, when did this come out?
[61:39.37]2000... I'm going to say 2008.
[61:43.19]2009?
[61:45.97]Thousand and... Thousand and... Where's the thing?
[61:54.24]It doesn't say what year.
[61:55.12]What year did this come out?
[61:56.70]I can't see it on the back of the box.
[61:57.68]2001?
[61:57.70]No, it's not.
[61:58.18]2011.
[61:58.26]Yeah, there it is.
[61:59.56]That's 10 years old.
[62:07.27]Which is the greatest sin?
[62:09.55]To torture a man's body to save his soul or to stand idle while the devil consumes him?
[62:17.55]If you, the righteous, do not oppose the devil, who will?
[62:22.72]How old is Skyrim?
[62:23.64]Evil still lives, but now the Inquisition stands against it.
[62:30.60]I can see the purifying flames.
[62:33.34]I can see a future free of the devil.
[62:39.61]I can see salvation for us all.
[62:43.73]God bless you all.
[62:46.39]Amen.
[62:48.45]BioShock came out before this?
[62:49.89]I don't know why I did that.
[62:57.47]What brings you here, Templar brothers?
[63:00.66]We slayed the beast.
[63:02.14]We slayed the beast that hunted your flock.
[63:05.76]Praise the Lord.
[63:07.14]Your deed will be well remembered by the Inquisition.
[63:10.70]Please 100% play through Sneak King rather than one more minute of this.
[63:14.70]Alas, the Abbey is closed.
[63:17.28]Alright, fine.
[63:18.14]We've lost an hour.
[63:19.46]I got what I wanted out of this.
[63:21.14]I thought it was fun.
[63:22.10]But it's time to put in Sneak King.
[63:28.03]There is nothing for you here.
[63:30.10]I thought it was fun.
[63:32.72]Wait.
[63:33.20]Follow Brother Lorenzo to find out more information about Marie's location.
[63:36.20]Approach with caution.
[63:37.50]Because getting too close will make him suspicious.
[63:39.56]But don't fall too far behind or you'll lose him along with all the hopes of finding Marie.
[63:45.54]Oh, it's a fucking escort quest.
[63:50.02]Keep back.
[63:50.82]He will hear us.
[63:51.28]But he won't get us.
[63:53.24]He looks like we were lost.
[63:59.35]We can't fail it.
[64:00.87]It really is an Assassin's Creed walk-behind-the-guy mission.
[64:09.40]Stop, please.
[64:10.32]But wait!
[64:10.82]I need to see what happens.
[64:11.62]Alright, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[64:21.00]I'll stop.
[64:30.05]Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[64:31.25]I just want to see what happens if he gets really annoyed.
[64:37.41]If I click on him enough times, is he going to do a funny response?
[64:40.43]Where he makes like a fart noise and goes like, Oh, sorry, that was me.
[64:43.76]Stop.
[64:44.60]Stop it.
[64:45.56]Get out of here.
[64:46.66]Leave me alone.
[64:47.60]You're annoying.
[64:49.12]Hello?
[64:50.04]Can I help you?
[64:51.10]Praise God.

[65:30.86]I want to make sure it looks good.
[65:43.27]No, fix it.
[65:44.87]Is it bad?
[65:49.59]Tested it earlier.
[65:50.33]Yeah, but people just say go because they don't want to wait like five minutes.
[66:03.01]Alright, when did this game come out?
[66:07.31]You know, I know this game has been a meme.
[66:09.51]It was a meme when it came out.
[66:11.59]But, I never played it.
[66:15.56]I don't even, I have no idea what this game, I know you like sneak around in like trash cans and stuff.
[66:18.88]2006.
[66:20.54]This is terrifying.
[66:31.08]Remove the context of the Burger King.
[66:32.38]This is a guy in a Burger King costume coming to kill everyone in this house.
[66:37.40]You know what I mean?
[66:38.12]Like, it's just a costume.
[66:51.82]How long is this intro?
[66:59.85]Sneak King.
[67:08.74]This is not an FMV, right?
[67:15.96]Display view cones.
[67:18.32]Play in the sneaking suit.
[67:19.69]Okay.
[67:23.43]How to play.
[67:24.29]Move.
[67:24.61]It's a first person mode.
[67:27.51]Move camera.
[67:28.09]Change zoom.
[67:28.69]Surprise.
[67:29.43]Flourish.
[67:31.01]Hide and cancel and run.
[67:33.84]Wait, there's 12 pages?
[67:36.92]Use the stick to make the king sneak around.
[67:39.58]Move the camera with R. If controller settings have been switched, yeah, whatever.
[67:43.89]In a challenge, hold the right trigger to run.
[67:46.15]Just go.
[67:47.07]Yeah, who cares?
[67:48.09]Each time you deliver food, your chain count goes up.
[67:54.97]This multiplies any score you earn.
[67:57.11]If anyone spots you, you'll lose it all.
[67:58.83]So be extra sneaky when your chain count gets high.
[68:03.99]Burger gear solid?
[68:07.73]Berga.
[68:08.83]Berger.
[68:10.09]Berger.
[68:11.65]Hey, Venn!
[68:12.43]Thanks for the 10 community sub, Venn.
[68:13.59]Commission's 0 out of 20.
[68:16.91]Do I have to deliver food to people?
[68:29.82]Sawmill challenge.
[68:30.70]It's morning and you've got enormous omelet sandwiches to give away.
[68:34.57]Make three deliveries to the hungry folks in the sawmill and consider this breakfast mission accomplished.
[68:39.27]Press the A button to deliver food, but try not to be seen.
[68:42.01]How are we supposed to deliver food to people that can't be seen?
[68:51.66]I can't deliver food.
[69:02.67]Fortnite taunting this guy.
[69:04.52]How do I deliver food to him?
[69:06.34]Delivery zero.
[69:07.42]How do I deliver food?
[69:33.71]How do I deliver food to people?
[69:38.34]Oh, that person wants a hamburger.
[69:39.32]Okay, that person.
[69:44.84]Just give them food.
[69:52.49]Why do I have to do this?
[69:53.49]If people ordered food, why wouldn't they just want it?
[70:05.40]Was this game free?
[70:12.41]Alright, so sneak up behind everybody.
[70:14.97]And then surprise them with a delicious 6 out of 10 Whopper.
[70:19.51]Because that's what it is.
[70:33.11]Sawmill.
[70:33.83]Oh wait, I can interact with this.
[70:39.88]His head just gets sliced off.
[70:42.80]I just jumped into the sawmill Wait, come on somebody come over here You don't feed everybody only the ones who want burgers
[71:13.75]Oh, are they just people on the mini-map?
[71:14.99]I don't know why I just asked if it was fall damage.
[71:19.19]I was about to say, is there fall damage?
[71:20.73]This person wants a burger, right?
[71:29.72]Oh, somebody wants one over here.
[71:31.38]I see it on the mini-map.
[71:34.40]I have to find the person that wants one on the mini-map and then go sneak to them.
[71:52.97]That guy doesn't want it anymore.
[71:53.87]God damn it.
[71:54.29]Alright, I get it.
[71:54.95]I get it.
[71:55.19]I get it.
[71:56.21]Everyone told me to skip the tutorial.
[72:09.46]Flourish.
[72:15.26]Okay, there's that one.
[72:16.94]I want to hide in the saw machine and scare somebody.
[72:18.88]Why would you scare a sawmill employee?
[72:23.80]That seems like the dumbest thing you could possibly do.
[72:34.15]New missions have been unlocked.
[72:35.13]Okay, well, I get it.
[72:35.93]Let's see.
[72:42.37]Doesn't matter.
[72:42.75]Alright, let's keep going.
[72:46.36]Now what?
[72:48.39]Wait, did I not get a good enough score?
[72:49.89]It's morning and you got in rank C. No, decline.
[72:54.36]Okay.
[73:17.73]I did it.
[73:20.10]Wait, is this... Is this one map?
[73:27.42]Is it just one map?
[73:31.14]This game had to... This game came free.
[73:34.88]In Burger King Happy Meals, or whatever they were.
[73:38.24]A true Sneaking would never keep the buttery goodness of those croissant witches to himself.
[73:43.40]He delivered these to three hungry citizens as fast as possible.
[73:48.59]And he'd do it in style without touching any blue vision zones.
[73:51.35]I thought there were arrows coming out of his crotch.
[74:00.22]Like somebody shot him twice with arrows.
[74:01.50]I was like, who fucking gutted this guy with arrows?
[74:03.92]Alright, who's hungry?
[74:12.77]This game was four bucks.
[74:14.11]Where did they sell it?
[74:14.91]Did they sell it at Burger King?
[74:18.34]How could you?
[74:18.64]Where did you buy this game?
[74:23.68]Oh, look at me!
[74:27.34]You did.
[74:27.80]I can't get spotted.
[74:37.25]Somebody's hungry over here.
[74:44.34]Is that guy still hungry?
[74:47.06]That person's hungry?
[74:53.17]What happened?
[74:54.93]Oh shit, they're coming this way.
[74:57.89]Like Hitman.
[75:02.12]I have to like dump a body in here.
[75:04.86]Wait, won't they just see me?
[75:08.62]Wouldn't you just see this person?
[75:19.29]Oh, everyone's so hungry.
[75:20.33]I'm not doing my job.
[75:29.52]Come here.
[75:33.60]Come on.
[75:36.76]Watch out.
[75:37.96]Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Away. Away. Away.
[75:38.87]Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[75:49.79]Please play the next game.
[75:52.51]The next game is going to... I'm going to tell you guys.
[75:56.03]The next game is going to be very, very hard to get me away from.
[75:59.83]The next game is going to be impossible for us to move on.
[76:02.96]I'm actually probably going to play it last because I'm terrified that I'm going to stay there forever.
[76:11.26]Can I get this person?
[76:13.97]This person coming around the side here.
[76:17.97]Is there a time limit?
[76:19.15]I think there is.
[76:22.13]No, not too human, but holy shit.
[76:23.99]I should get it.
[76:24.79]Right here.
[76:36.54]Oh, fuck.
[76:38.34]Oh, fuck!
[76:48.16]Got it.
[76:54.93]New missions have been unlocked.
[76:55.99]Let me just... This is bad.
[77:06.30]Two human is free since they can't legally sell it anymore.
[77:10.94]What?
[77:11.18]I mean, they can't legally sell it.
[77:23.72]Three flourishes without being seen.
[77:24.98]I'm kind of curious if there's anything else in this game.
[77:28.96]Let's do this fast.
[77:29.60]The Unreal Engine lawsuit thing.
[77:39.21]Well, I mean, nobody sells it anyways.
[77:41.35]You'd be buying it secondhand no matter what you did.
[77:48.27]Am I going to cut this tree down?
[77:52.13]Hmm.
[77:58.52]That's gonna kill- that would hurt somebody.
[77:59.89]You're gonna hurt someone.
[78:05.43]That person- this person passed out from like being hungry.
[78:10.33]Just walked on their body.
[78:23.45]dropping like flies not good enough why
[78:52.46]Wait until everyone passes out.
[78:54.00]I just beat it.
[78:54.58]Oh, was that one... That one, quote, was not... Quote?
[78:58.50]What do you mean quote?
[78:59.42]That one was, quote, not good enough.
[79:06.73]Sneak King.
[79:08.19]I think there's more than one location.
[79:09.45]Did I switch to Goblin Commander?
[79:15.49]Or are we done with this?
[79:16.56]What do you think?
[79:17.88]That's what's next.
[79:28.43]I'm breaking the rule here.
[79:29.47]This has not been 30 minutes.
[79:30.49]It's been 20.
[79:40.99]Deliver double the jolts by not only surprising some lucky sawmill worker with a stimulating cup of BK Joe coffee, but doing it from within a hiding place.
[79:50.96]Oh, wow.
[79:52.10]Next game, please.
[79:53.00]No!
[79:54.44]I've got to deliver some BK Joe.
[79:59.65]Get away from me.
[80:00.99]This head is so big.
[80:11.50]Alright, here comes somebody.
[80:17.53]Am I interested in a cup of BK Joe?
[80:19.07]I should just sit here until somebody's there.
[80:22.71]This game sucks.
[80:23.41]Next game.
[80:26.70]Just wait a minute.
[80:27.86]I need to scare somebody into drinking coffee.
[80:32.29]This person's coming.
[80:32.99]Two Human is 100% free on Xbox Live.
[80:38.21]Is it really?
[80:38.85]Maybe I should get it.
[80:42.95]Would you guys want to watch Two Human?
[80:44.67]You will for maybe like an hour.
[80:46.47]Alright, this is not a good place to be.
[80:59.85]Sneak King.
[81:03.18]Should I hide in the outhouse?
[81:10.24]I want to see other games.
[81:12.66]Yeah, I know.
[81:13.16]Me too.
[81:13.40]I feel like we're going to play Goblin Commander for a while.
[81:20.35]Let's get this out of our system so nobody tells me and begs me to go back to play Sneak King.
[81:26.79]Got this guy right here.
[81:34.55]No!
[81:34.87]They're going to pass out before I get a chance.
[81:36.95]Come on, this is stupid.
[81:39.03]Play Sneak King.
[81:50.25]Dropping like flies.
[81:51.51]Yeah.
[81:53.51]How are you supposed to hide and do this if this happens?
[82:00.37]Goblin Commander is an RTS?
[82:02.77]What?
[82:04.63]It does not look like an RTS.
[82:05.97]It looks like a game where you have a bunch of goblins go do things for you.
[82:15.83]No one's even gonna come over here.
[82:16.83]This is stupid.
[82:23.39]Yes, this is Sneak King.
[82:27.87]Everybody remembers this very fondly for being hilarious and crazy and zany and comedy and memes.
[82:34.06]as you see this is what this is it this is it it's not like that funny it's not that like crazy and rare it's just stupid so all the people that you've heard talk about like oh my god oh my god one time the Burger King did this thing oh my god listen where they made an Xbox game where you snuck around as a king and gave them like frappuccinos and stuff it was so ridiculous it was the funniest ad campaign ever no this was dumb this game sucks
[83:03.43]This is what it was.
[83:05.01]This is what they were talking about.
[83:17.43]Wait.
[83:20.03]Who said that?
[83:21.51]I don't know.
[83:21.97]We're making up a straw man to knock it down and be annoyed at a person that might not even exist.
[83:27.90]Welcome to the world.
[83:29.18]Welcome to 2021.
[83:43.57]I'm very angry at a theoretical person.
[83:46.99]This person could exist.
[83:48.45]I don't know.
[83:49.07]Maybe?
[83:49.39]I like the previous game.
[84:00.72]I need to just do this.
[84:02.20]If I don't beat the first level, then I'll never hear the end of it.
[84:10.42]You're turning into Andy.
[84:12.18]No, no, you're turning into Goofy.
[84:14.59]Why did I come... What do you mean goofy?
[84:15.81]What do you mean?
[84:23.53]Takes an hour to beat the first level?
[84:29.86]no what okay well this is the only time I'm ever gonna play this I didn't get it when Burger King put it out I didn't play it now I don't want to miss out on the fun I don't want to have to remember this game ever again I don't want to slow down don't do that don't get into that how am I supposed to do this
[84:58.92]Where can I hide to, like, get somebody?
[85:00.68]There's only one person that walks in the path of a... What about over here?
[85:09.40]Finish this game for 200 million off the debt.
[85:12.58]That's not worth it to me, because... Sure, I could finish the game and get 200 million off the debt, but...
[85:19.33]You will that this is gonna get nominated for worst stream if I play sneaking for like another four hours This will be nominated for worst stream of the year.
[85:27.41]So like what am I gonna do?
[85:28.77]That's not enough We go It already is oh We say funny things we think we say things that are funny don't we oh
[85:52.42]Look at how funny the funny things we say are, right?
[86:04.33]We do a little trolling here.
[86:08.78]Just me, the streamer, and my army of trolls.
[86:15.13]Seething.
[86:15.59]Alright, I'm done.
[86:17.40]I don't want to play this anymore.
[86:18.50]This game's not good.
[86:21.80]Can't you just imagine?
[86:22.70]Alright, we're gonna make up a bunch of people in a room.
[86:25.34]We're gonna make them up because that's what we're doing right now.
[86:28.14]See, like, I just see, like, five or six people sitting around on a couch.
[86:32.16]They all have big, large Burger King drinks.
[86:35.33]Like, big, like, super-sized, like, 40-ounce drinks.
[86:39.35]Fountain drinks.
[86:40.89]And this is, like, they've already eaten the Burger King food.
[86:44.88]They're just laughing hysterically and, like, every- just cracking up.
[86:48.31]There's, like, six or seven people on this couch.
[86:50.47]And every time you jump out and do, like, the dance, you hear, like, Oh my god!
[86:57.35]And then, like, They're all, like, at the end of their drinks because they drank almost a large fucking Coke.
[87:03.11]All of them.
[87:03.71]And they all think it's so funny.
[87:09.67]I just keep seeing them laughing at this and it's making me angry.
[87:16.66]Is that a bridge?
[87:28.18]Here's your chance to elevate your sneaking to an art form worthy of that of robe and crown.
[87:32.15]Deliver five of these enormous omelet sandwiches without being seen or heard.
[87:35.61]Really pushing the omelet sandwich, which may be the grossest thing on the whole menu.
[87:40.79]So, omelet sandwich, omelet sandwich, omelet sandwich.
[87:45.43]It's terrible.
[87:46.15]It's the worst thing on the menu.
[87:48.71]They must have had a stockpile of like 600 million of these that they had to really get rid of.
[87:52.27]These were terrible.
[87:59.21]What was the... What was... I don't even know what the thing was.
[88:00.89]This would be a good game if it was an RPG.
[88:06.02]I don't know.
[88:08.02]I have a headache?
[88:09.50]I don't know.
[88:09.84]The king's got like a big migraine.
[88:11.42]This is like not... Based anti-corporation streamer.
[88:22.27]Anti-corporation.
[88:28.68]You guys can trust me.
[88:30.28]You guys can trust me.
[88:31.76]I'm an anti-corporation streamer.
[88:33.20]Trust me.
[88:35.10]How does anybody see me?
[88:35.84]What?
[88:54.56]Based in corporate PILD.
[88:59.81]What does that even mean?
[89:01.09]Trying to figure out what that means.
[89:02.65]Alright, I need to do this.
[89:03.59]I'm stuck in this stupid game.
[89:05.45]Everybody laugh.
[89:07.35]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[89:07.89]We have to really... Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[89:11.81]Alright, it's time to make everybody that comes to the channel that's new think this is like the worst, like, fucking cringe community ever, okay?
[89:22.05]You have to play along.
[89:22.79]We have to make it so anytime I do the king dance, we all laugh really hard.
[89:28.17]You don't have to laugh that hard.
[89:30.40]Don't make it that obvious.
[89:32.30]Just do omega lows.
[89:33.82]Make sure it's all omega lows.
[89:36.34]And then we'll go back to normal, right?
[89:38.56]We have to be like, oh my god, I love that dance.
[89:40.88]I'm going to do it five or six times in a row.
[89:44.92]We have to make people think that we think this is really funny.
[89:48.22]Then they never come back.
[89:51.97]Are you ready?
[89:53.41]Don't do it now.
[89:54.25]You're fucking it up.
[89:54.93]Stop.
[89:56.39]No, you're reusing the joke.
[89:59.62]It's not reusing a joke.
[90:00.94]I love this routine, okay?
[90:02.68]I'm going to do this routine whenever I'm able to.
[90:06.46]I love the, like, get 10 people to think that this whole community is fucking crazy.
[90:14.52]Stop doing it.
[90:15.20]You're doing it wrong.
[90:15.94]Just wait.
[90:16.70]Come on.
[90:17.18]You guys are way better than this.
[90:23.41]Just wait.
[90:24.39]You have to, like, just wait.
[90:30.35]We already are.
[90:31.11]No, but, like, they don't know that right away.
[90:33.57]It takes about a year being here in this community before you figure out, holy shit, we're all, like, nuts.
[90:39.82]I don't want them to have to wait that long.
[90:43.56]Is this, like, Link's house?
[90:50.62]Where am I?
[90:54.74]Can I- Imagine if I could just grab this guy by the shirt and pull him off like Hitman.
[90:59.16]Stop!
[90:59.72]No!
[91:00.10]Don't- Alright, I'm- You have to wait till I get into character.
[91:04.90]I'm not in character yet.
[91:07.07]You're blowing it.
[91:08.79]It's only when I do the dance and then that's it.
[91:15.33]Just wait till I do the dance.
[91:16.23]It's when I do the arm up dance.
[91:18.33]Everyone has to do it and then stop.
[91:19.46]Can I just kick this lady?
[91:21.80]Alright, here we go.
[91:22.30]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[91:23.76]One, two, three.
[91:27.69]Oh, my God.
[91:29.97]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[91:34.22]I completely forgot about this game.
[91:36.42]Oh, no.
[91:39.52]Oh, crap.
[91:42.78]Me and my buddies would sit on the couch right when this came out.
[91:46.13]It was so much fun.
[91:48.21]I remember we would just sit on the couch.
[91:49.23]It was like five or six of us.
[91:50.25]And we would just laugh at this shit.
[91:52.03]The king is so funny.
[91:59.26]What should I do?
[91:59.62]Should I hide, like, in the leaves?
[92:02.03]I wonder if I... Can I get somebody like this?
[92:03.81]What the heck was that?
[92:08.21]Oh, shh, shh, shh.
[92:08.75]Somebody's coming.
[92:09.13]Somebody's coming.
[92:11.37]Somebody's coming.
[92:13.05]It's so funny.
[92:15.87]What happened to that guy?
[92:16.73]I can't... Like, I can, like, seriously barely contain it.
[92:23.29]I know it's coming, too.
[92:26.45]This is so classic.
[92:27.77]I love it.
[92:29.91]This is like classic 90s comedy.
[92:33.91]Okay, here we go.
[92:34.61]It's gonna happen again.
[92:35.27]Look at that stupid dance.
[92:47.79]I love those too.
[92:48.45]That's like my favorite item.
[92:49.23]Is this the omelet?
[92:51.01]Here comes the two in a row!
[92:57.73]It's so funny.
[93:00.21]Oh.
[93:02.28]That's two in a row, but that seriously is probably my favorite sandwich.
[93:06.78]I wish they would bring that back.
[93:10.17]Bring back the omelet sandwich.
[93:11.29]Everybody loved it.
[93:12.39]At least me and my friends did.
[93:16.04]We would order it.
[93:16.98]Me and like four or five of us, we'd go to the drive-thru.
[93:18.50]And it'd be like, hey, bros, what are we getting?
[93:21.32]And at the same time, we would all kind of side-eye each other.
[93:23.30]And then after like three or four seconds, we'd go, omelet sandwich!
[93:26.86]And we'd pull in.
[93:28.36]It's so funny.
[93:29.18]I love it.
[93:35.87]I'm gonna go this way.
[93:41.51]Ah, nothing beat that.
[93:42.83]Is everybody alright?
[93:43.65]Hopefully everyone gets up soon.
[93:49.14]Those are the days.
[93:49.88]It really was.
[93:50.64]Back in like the mid-90s.
[93:52.22]Like late 90s, mid-90s.
[93:53.04]I wanted like the drive-thru with like your buddies and stuff.
[93:59.13]Oh, I missed that.
[93:59.65]Like you can't do that shit anymore.
[94:01.81]You know what I mean?
[94:05.39]Like only in like 1998 could you go to like a drive-thru.
[94:07.93]Like a Burger King drive-thru.
[94:09.33]A McDonald's drive-thru.
[94:10.17]You can't like... People don't do that.
[94:13.69]They only did that back in like the 90s.
[94:17.85]How much better the toys were, too.
[94:22.78]They were so much better than they are now.
[94:28.30]We would trade.
[94:28.98]I remember when I was younger.
[94:32.36]This is probably... I don't know, maybe like three or four years ago.
[94:37.06]Friends of ours, we would get the Happy Meals and stuff.
[94:39.25]And we would look at each other.
[94:39.93]We'd side-eye each other and be like, who's trading who?
[94:43.09]And sometimes we would get the same things.
[94:44.73]Like, let's say it was like a Hot Wheels thing.
[94:48.04]Two of us, three of us would get the same car.
[94:50.02]And it'd be like, oh, shit RNG.
[94:53.94]And we would all start laughing.
[94:56.23]This dance.
[95:03.45]Oh, it's so funny.
[95:06.33]I should dress up as the king in my next stream and do that dance.
[95:11.08]And like present you guys like a sandwich.
[95:14.80]I only have to do two more.
[95:19.51]Oh, so hungry.
[95:20.41]Got it.
[95:20.75]Can I get two in a row?
[95:29.56]That's my favorite part right there.
[95:31.62]When he does like the knees.
[95:36.14]I'm sad that we're not going to be able to see it again.
[95:39.04]After this mission.
[95:40.56]Can I get this guy?
[95:41.26]Oh, crap.
[95:52.08]Can I run?
[95:57.56]Ah, I just missed it.
[96:01.00]This game is hilarious.
[96:02.08]I know, and people forgot about it.
[96:04.89]People forgot this existed.
[96:07.23]I'm the only one that remembers.
[96:08.71]Me and my friends on the couch.
[96:10.55]Those are the only people that know this exists.
[96:12.85]No one else does.
[96:13.83]Only us.
[96:14.49]Only my four friends.
[96:16.25]Sitting on the couch with our large cokes.
[96:27.05]I did it!
[96:27.51]I can't do it anymore.
[96:34.06]It's too much for me.
[96:34.80]I have to stop.
[96:36.32]I have to stop.
[96:37.08]I have to stop doing this.
[96:42.89]That was going on for a while, too, and I wonder how many people came and left.
[96:47.71]Thank God.
[96:48.83]One more mission.
[96:49.47]I have to do seven.
[96:51.61]Lucky seven.
[97:00.53]I want to see another map.
[97:03.01]Next game.
[97:04.09]Oh my god, what a classic.
[97:05.43]That was so convincing.
[97:07.81]No, it wasn't at all, actually.
[97:09.97]It was just... It was so unconvincing that maybe it was convincing.
[97:13.86]This game looks like HD.
[97:28.31]It was concerning.
[97:35.85]Alright, hold on.
[97:38.09]Sometimes surprise and sneak ability aren't enough.
[97:40.01]At those times, you need to pick up your robe and turn on the speed.
[97:42.35]Deliver croissant which breakfast sandwiches to three people.
[97:44.85]What's with the breakfast sandwiches?
[97:48.69]30 seconds?
[97:49.11]I don't think I can do that.
[97:50.97]That was acting straight up from the room.
[97:56.11]That's pretty good acting in that, actually, so that doesn't bother me.
[98:03.94]There goes the laughing.
[98:06.20]Oh shit, I got it.
[98:11.99]Oh, mega love.
[98:17.41]Got it.
[98:24.42]That's like an angry cat.
[98:37.98]now that was a real like that was a real joke that you would have heard during that routine two minutes ago I'm stuck in that routine I think
[99:02.46]I'm just waiting to see.
[99:03.96]I'm waiting to look over and see everybody laughing.
[99:10.14]What the fuck?
[99:10.92]This game sucks.
[99:12.03]We're moving on.
[99:15.45]Wait, I want to do it one more time.
[99:16.71]I can get it.
[99:17.93]I just want to see the laughing.
[99:23.63]Oh my god, not laughing.
[99:32.71]Aren't psychopaths usually good at acting?
[99:35.28]You just said I was bad at acting, therefore I'm not a psychopath.
[99:37.76]Is that what you're talking about?
[99:55.82]There's no iframes there, so if you get stuck there when you get out, somebody's next to you, you're gonna get caught.
[100:04.13]Alright, I'm done.
[100:12.99]I have to get out of here.
[100:18.21]Why is the king so huge?
[100:27.80]That's enough.
[100:28.90]Yeah, that's enough.
[100:30.50]Let's go to Goblin Commander.
[100:33.88]I have high hopes for Goblin Commander.
[100:35.54]That's why I've waited this long to play it.
[100:38.20]I have high hopes for the next game as well.
[100:40.28]That's why I'm waiting to play that one last.
[100:42.38]Because I feel like if I play that one right now, I'll get stuck playing it.
[100:45.84]It's guaranteed.
[100:53.77]So you think Sneak King will be... I don't know.
[100:57.21]Do you guys think Burger King will still be a company?
[101:00.23]In 50 years?
[101:01.05]Or 100 years?
[101:07.23]I think about that sometimes.
[101:08.13]If you think about like the games that, not the games, the companies and the places now, they're probably not going to exist in a hundred plus years.
[101:17.43]I don't think so.
[101:17.95]2003, oh my God.
[101:30.46]It'll be the only thing left to eat.
[101:39.08]Goblin Commander.
[101:41.16]Why does this look like when you get an iPhone game on your iPad?
[101:45.97]You have to press the 2x button on the bottom right, and that's how you automatically know to uninstall it.
[101:50.43]This actually looks pretty sick.
[101:59.53]Can I make this look any better? 2003.
[102:07.58]Is it an RTS?
[102:08.68]It looks good, though.
[102:10.00]It's kind of bright.
[102:15.78]Campaign.
[102:18.84]Humans won't be around in 100 years.
[102:27.99]Campaign.
[102:28.49]Do I have to make a name?
[102:31.67]How about
[102:36.39]Irma.
[102:36.63]Is it three letters?
[102:40.53]It's more than three letters.
[102:41.41]Okay.
[102:42.29]Here we go.
[102:45.83]Don't matter.
[102:46.13]Whatever.
[102:53.72]Only beasts will be left.
[102:55.28]I don't know what the hell is going to be left.
[102:58.38]Probably just bugs and insects.
[103:02.17]Our story is not one of Providence, not one of divinity.
[103:06.48]It's going to be insects and alligators.
[103:08.28]From the primordial slime.
[103:11.24]Those stories we leave to humans and their endless thirst for pride.
[103:19.44]Our kind was not so much born as we were created, wrought through the power of the Moonstone by the human Frizzile.
[103:29.43]At once granted purpose, granted life, and made whole.
[103:36.04]Gonna come... They're gone.
[103:37.54]You can stop the cringe routine.
[103:38.80]I haven't said anything.
[103:40.00]Walking Owl versus Alligator.
[103:40.90]Which one wins?
[103:41.30]Um... Alligator.
[104:01.88]it was a good life working for that which we were created but as they say what are the animals that lasted the million years from like the jurassic period that's what's going to still be around horseshoe crabs crocodiles bugs like insects
[104:36.34]Here we go.
[104:41.43]Time to create my... I'm a bad guy in this game, right?
[104:45.71]Take goblins and I try to take over the world?

[108:46.69]Okay, let's go.
[108:55.99]Stone crushers.
[109:00.83]Can we go through this?
[109:01.35]How do we open this?
[109:06.63]This is what the Jerma community looks like.
[109:16.67]Um, there's like six of you?
[109:20.71]There's more than six people here.
[109:23.70]What is this?
[109:25.40]Breakable objects.
[109:26.24]Many of the objects found in the world are breakable.
[109:28.50]To order your clan to attack an object, place a waypoint flag on it.
[109:31.64]Sword icon will appear, right?
[109:34.04]Alright, so break it.
[109:34.84]What's in there?
[109:37.91]Coins?
[109:38.37]Ooh, break it all.
[109:41.15]Yep, break it.
[109:44.26]Do you like this game?
[109:44.96]I don't know.
[109:45.92]I have to play it first.
[109:49.82]Destroy all boulders in the area.
[109:52.47]That's the mission.
[109:53.01]Okay.
[110:05.43]I bet you like it.
[110:08.27]Dirty RTS lover.
[110:16.31]What is that?
[110:18.18]An RTS lover?
[110:19.48]That's bad to like the genre RTS?
[110:22.94]Is Starcraft 2 still popular?
[110:24.22]Grind the vermin into pulp.
[110:27.78]There's a waypoint flag near them.
[110:34.31]Using the appropriate clan button.
[110:36.11]Okay, let's go.
[110:41.41]Attack.
[110:41.75]This is why we're playing this game.
[110:49.95]Look at how funny this is.
[110:51.48]Look at how many jokes it is, you guys.
[110:57.56]Shit, it is you guys.
[111:00.02]Okay.
[111:07.19]To take direct control, position the commander over it and press the Y button.
[111:18.32]Oh shit, this game just got so much better.
[111:20.06]Okay, I got direct control over this guy.
[111:31.94]Let's go.
[111:32.35]In direct control, pressing the A button while standing in front of an object will cause your clan to attack it, as long as it's breakable.
[111:48.84]And?
[111:51.12]Cool.
[111:51.60]Wait, I want to release.
[111:52.62]How do I release out of this guy?
[111:55.40]Does he have to die?
[111:56.02]I want to be the guy with the whip.
[112:04.03]This is cool.
[112:04.75]I like this.
[112:10.25]What's the mission?
[112:11.37]Destroy all the boulders.
[112:14.03]It's Goblin Pikmin, but you can actually control the Pikmin.
[112:22.31]We're almost out of the tutorial.
[112:28.15]Is this game rare?
[112:33.58]I think this is a rare game.
[112:42.97]I love playing rare games for you guys.
[112:44.73]Because you can see what it was like playing games that weren't rare when I was your age.
[112:54.69]Context-sensitive tooltips related to objects and characters nearby and the controller command will appear in the upper right center of the screen.
[113:00.28]Yeah, I see.
[113:00.72]So it's like Legends of Zelda.
[113:12.71]It might not even be like Legend of Zelda.
[113:13.99]That's just Ocarina of Time.
[113:14.96]It's the only game I played.
[113:19.68]Why are you reading the tips?
[113:22.24]Because if I don't, I'm going to miss something.
[113:23.68]It's going to be horrible.
[113:25.76]I have 176 bucks.
[113:28.74]There's a lazy lump of a stone ogre sleeping on the job.
[113:32.04]Okay.
[113:33.68]Are we going to go get him?
[113:36.62]I might even put him back to work.
[113:46.31]I feel like I'm watching a stream of somebody streaming a game back in like 2010.
[113:54.08]I don't feel like I'm playing this game.
[113:55.06]I feel like I'm watching a stream of this game.
[114:02.83]It's huge.
[114:04.97]Alright.
[114:06.07]Prediction.
[114:06.67]Is this guy human or not?
[114:09.34]Titans are powerful monstrosities that, through direct control, can be used to inflict heavy damage.
[114:15.17]To take direct control of a Titan, position the commander over it and press the Y button.
[114:22.87]While in direct control, use the various buttons in order your Titan to attack.
[114:27.71]To adjust the camera, use the right thumb stick.
[114:40.67]Looks like he's injured.
[114:41.63]Need to feed him so he can heal himself.
[114:43.01]Holy shit!
[114:47.46]What did I just do?
[114:48.24]Health halo.
[114:51.50]Located around the unit's base, health halos represent the unit's current state.
[114:56.89]When the halo is green, the unit is in good health.
[115:00.45]When it's yellow, the unit is in fair health.
[115:02.13]And when it is red, the unit is in poor health.
[115:05.41]And will likely die if it takes any more damage.
[115:10.72]I need to get health.
[115:11.56]I get to be this huge guy.
[115:12.66]This is perfect.
[115:15.80]Eat.
[115:20.78]Well... I thought it was funny when you killed me.
[115:31.52]How do I open- how do I get out of here?
[115:33.64]Use the stone or we're gonna eat all the critters in the room.
[115:45.61]This is- I love this part.
[115:46.75]It's like my favorite part.
[115:52.05]What if I eat the commander?
[115:53.39]Hold on.
[115:54.03]Can I eat the commander?
[115:59.46]I'm the commander now.
[116:00.34]Why am I yellow?
[116:10.02]Open the door.
[116:10.44]I have to eat all of them?
[116:19.63]Am I poisoning everybody?
[116:20.71]What am I doing?
[116:21.17]How am I... I have to eat all of them, not just get to green.
[116:31.20]The debris from that cave-in should have been cleaned up hours ago.
[116:34.66]Time to get to work.
[116:40.04]Get all that money.
[116:41.04]Alright, let's clear this out.
[116:46.15]Oh, I love this.
[116:47.23]Okay.
[116:48.47]This game...
[116:50.80]When I first got in, I was looking at what the game was like.
[116:53.54]Oh, you have to like walk around.
[116:55.30]It was like a 4 out of 10 for me.
[116:56.93]And I was going to just move on in like 20 minutes.
[116:59.33]Now, this changes everything.
[117:05.05]Don't just stand around and gawking.
[117:06.23]Get in there and help.
[117:09.16]Following Titans.
[117:10.94]To instruct a clan to follow your Titan, pull and hold the left trigger and double tap the clan button.
[117:17.71]Hold and hold the left trigger, then press the appropriate clamp button to place a waypoint flag.
[117:27.09]Oh, okay.
[117:27.56]So then they'll just go there.
[117:32.88]Double tap?
[117:41.00]What's going on?
[117:44.53]Left trigger, and then they stand here.
[117:51.31]Break up all debris in the room.
[117:55.45]Didn't I do that already?
[117:56.75]No.
[117:57.43]There's debris over here.
[118:03.22]He had it.
[118:03.76]You double tap to follow.
[118:05.26]Oh, okay.
[118:08.70]I can't step on them and crush them, can I?
[118:17.10]Really fun playthrough.
[118:17.80]Reminds me of this really funny game.
[118:19.50]Me and my buddies used to play called Sneak King.
[118:21.00]You should check it out sometime.
[118:21.84]I think you'd enjoy it.
[118:22.54]Were you on the couch?
[118:23.12]Were you on the couch at all with extra large cokes?
[118:28.85]Down to the ice?
[118:32.53]If not, then I don't care about what you have to say.
[118:41.00]Instruct your units to follow the stone ogre and lead them to the door.
[118:52.21]Great.
[118:52.75]Fuck.
[118:53.54]It's a blade worm.
[118:54.86]And it stirred up more of those filthy critters.
[118:56.86]We must destroy it.
[118:57.62]Everyone doesn't care about chat.
[119:03.44]No, I don't, alright?
[119:04.52]You got it out of me.
[119:05.74]It took you six straight fucking years.
[119:07.99]You finally got it out of me.
[119:09.47]I don't like it.
[119:10.37]I don't like chat.
[119:12.49]I've been bottling this up for ten years, okay?
[119:15.73]Ugh!
[119:17.77]My god!
[119:21.48]Like, seriously.
[119:22.50]I'm trying to keep it together, but... Oh, that person said the Burger King thing.
[119:31.78]And my teeth were just clenching the whole time he said it.
[119:35.68]Ugh!
[119:41.29]I won.
[119:42.29]Souls collected 44.
[119:43.29]Gold collected 446.
[119:44.67]Two units lost.
[119:46.51]This game's fun.
[119:47.25]I like this.
[119:49.45]Everyone sit down.
[119:49.93]Clip it.
[119:50.48]Clip it.
[119:50.96]Clip it.
[119:51.44]Clip it.
[119:52.78]We're doing our best.
[119:57.56]Here comes the meltdown.
[119:59.56]Here it is.
[120:00.18]The career-ending meltdown.
[120:09.68]You say psych, you hurt my feelings.
[120:12.22]Of course it's a psych.
[120:19.12]Horizon time, time for work.
[120:20.96]On the count of three, I'm coming in there.
[120:23.08]One.
[120:23.26]Two.
[120:26.32]Enter the clan shrine and create five miners.
[120:35.24]Oh.
[120:36.86]This is the stone crusher clan shrine.
[120:40.05]Here you can buy goblins, unlock caged goblins, and upgrade your units.
[120:44.51]To navigate the clan shrine, use the left thumbstick.
[120:46.73]Okay.
[120:49.43]Goblins cost resources, which are displayed at the bottom of the screen.
[120:53.47]To buy the highlighted goblin, press the A button, and it will appear outside the clan shrine.
[121:00.12]Moving to the current waypoint for the clan.
[121:03.29]No clan can have more than 10 goblins at any time.
[121:06.58]Notice the stone crusher icon located at the bottom left of the screen.
[121:10.22]This indicates how many goblins are currently in the clan.
[121:12.98]I gotta retake that.
[121:14.48]Retake.
[121:14.80]That was a bad take.
[121:17.34]Exit the clan shrine plus the Y button.
[121:19.66]Alright, we need miners.
[121:23.41]Miner.
[121:24.33]How many do we need?
[121:24.85]Alright, five miners.
[121:30.29]Goblins.
[121:34.34]I want, uh, I want rock throwers.
[121:35.76]Why not?
[121:42.59]Well, time is resources.
[121:45.15]Now that we slept half the day away, we need to scour the area for gold and souls.
[121:54.71]Oh.
[121:55.55]I want direct control of this guy.
[122:01.26]If it's analog control, then it's not an RTS for me.
[122:04.06]It's more fun to play.
[122:05.02]Fake gamer.
[122:17.83]Why do you hate real video games?
[122:19.24]Do I have to answer that question?
[122:25.88]Do you want me to answer that question?
[122:27.18]Why do I hate real video games?
[122:32.92]I would like you to name me a video game that's come out in the last year that you would like me to play right now.
[122:38.70]That all of us can sit here and agree is a game that should be played.
[122:43.53]That should be here.
[122:44.59]Which one?
[122:56.52]Hades.
[122:57.56]I already played Hades, and it was great.
[122:59.02]I played it, I streamed it like three times, and I played a shitload of it off stream, and I got like the hardest achievements in the game.
[123:05.36]It was really fun.
[123:08.62]Like gold by smashing, where are the boulders?
[123:16.32]No, games aren't good.
[123:18.99]Only old games are good.
[123:23.78]back to the shrine and strengthen the equipment only old games are fun ooh tools and play Jack and dexter it came out in 2001. I don't like want to play that I can I be I have to be honest again I don't I don't know Jack and dexter zach and wiki

[123:53.66]I don't want to play them.
[123:54.52]I'm not a big fan.
[123:58.58]Located on the front pedestals in the clan shrine, each clan has a set of three upgrades.
[124:04.84]The first two apply to all goblins in the clan, while the last applies to the clan support unit.
[124:09.47]Each of these upgrades can be purchased three times.
[124:12.15]Alright, cool.
[124:13.01]Let's get it.
[124:16.33]Hammers are strong.
[124:20.21]Armor.

[124:42.14]Oh my god.
[124:42.44]It has all the wacky guns.
[124:44.80]Insomniac made it.
[124:48.02]Ratchet and Clank.
[124:48.74]Yeah.
[124:52.58]They all seem like the same dream characters to me.
[125:02.75]Alright, find additional souls.
[125:04.39]Let's go.
[125:07.40]How are they the same?

[125:39.52]Isn't that like Jack and Dexter?
[125:42.70]Jack and Wiki?
[125:45.84]Uh, Ratchet and Clank?
[125:47.38]Who's Clank?
[125:54.23]No, I don't put Banjo-Kazooie in that category.
[125:56.53]Because Banjo-Kazooie don't have big, uh, goofy weapons.
[126:01.61]It's a robot.
[126:05.31]He's the robot.
[126:07.45]Does he have comedy lines though?
[126:09.70]Does he pop up on the shoulder and say like a comedy line in a cutscene?
[126:14.92]Right?
[126:27.59]I don't know.
[126:30.24]If you have and in the middle of your game title, I'm not sure I'm going to play it.
[126:35.72]Or I'm not going to get too involved.
[126:39.04]That is what it is.
[126:39.72]That's what it is.
[126:40.18]That's what it is.
[126:40.76]Oh my god.

[127:29.26]What are some other ones?
[127:33.11]Mac and Cheese?
[127:35.38]I actually don't really like mac and cheese.
[127:39.85]Mac and cheese is not mac and cheese.
[127:42.77]It's mac and cheese.
[127:44.47]It's like mac and apostrophe cheese.
[127:48.61]But I don't really eat it.
[127:50.59]Dungeons & Dragons.

[127:52.44]I'm not a big fan of that game.
[127:54.39]Simpsons hit and run, don't fu- no, that doesn't, that's not accurate.
[127:58.57]That's Simpsons hit and run.
[128:01.33]A hit and run is like a thing happening.
[128:05.56]A hit and run is like, it's an action.
[128:07.86]It's not like something and something.
[128:13.98]Black and white.
[128:16.22]That, alright, you might got me there.
[128:18.61]You might have me there.

[128:31.69]Two names.
[128:32.37]Like two names.
[128:34.25]Tell them.
[128:34.65]Do we have any more?
[128:36.91]I don't like two names.
[128:41.95]Tom and Jerry.
[128:42.89]Yeah.
[128:44.03]I don't want to watch that fucking movie.
[128:45.63]I don't want to watch it.
[128:53.77]Kane and Lynch.
[128:55.71]That game's not fun.
[128:57.49]I played it because we had a timer.
[129:10.22]Tim and Eric.
[129:11.30]Oh, shit.
[129:11.84]There you go.
[129:13.50]Yeah.
[129:15.22]That's right.
[129:15.87]But, wait a minute.
[129:18.29]Tim and Eric, the title of that show was Tim and Eric, awesome show, great job.
[129:24.11]It wasn't, the show was not called Tim and Eric.
[129:27.78]It was Tim and Eric, awesome show, great job.
[129:32.16]Wallace and Gromit.
[129:33.96]I didn't really watch it.
[129:35.16]I didn't really care for it.
[129:36.45]I thought it was, like, cool, but I didn't watch it because it was two characters with an and in the middle.
[129:42.63]Sex and the City.
[129:43.96]No, yeah, didn't watch that fucking show either.
[129:46.20]Didn't care about it at all.
[129:47.16]I didn't want to watch one episode.
[129:55.44]Ren and Stimpy.
[129:57.15]And you've got it right there.
[129:58.23]It was not Ren and Stimpy.
[130:00.81]It was Ren ampersand Stimpy.
[130:03.39]Completely different.
[130:04.21]I would watch that show a thousand times.
[130:08.75]It's not Rick ampersand Morty.
[130:10.53]It's Rick and Morty.
[130:11.75]Don't want to watch it.
[130:21.77]That actually is weird how that's true for me.
[130:25.82]If it was, if it was Jack ampersand Dexter, I might like care.
[130:29.94]Why is that?
[130:30.60]That's weird.
[130:31.24]Why do I do that?
[130:40.58]Ed, Ed and Eddie.
[130:42.00]I didn't, I did not watch that much of that show.
[130:44.74]I think I watched like two episodes.
[130:55.01]Alright, I need to make new people, because I lost everybody.
[130:57.61]Problems like the rock thrower that are not available appear in cages.
[131:04.40]To unlock a cage, select the desire goblin using the left thumb to see if you can present it to everyone.
[131:13.16]Two.
[131:14.30]One, two, three, four, five.
[131:17.08]Okay, plenty of miners.
[131:18.38]Let's go.
[131:18.58]Alright, I got ten units now.
[131:22.87]I hate conjunctions in English grammar.
[131:27.78]I mean, I... It's just a weird thing.
[131:39.69]Ratchet, amp... Ratchet, ampersand, clank.
[131:44.61]Don't do the same thing I just did, please!
[131:46.69]What are you doing?
[131:47.23]Please don't do that!
[131:47.99]What am I doing?
[131:48.63]Run away!
[131:58.31]Alvin and Hobbes.
[132:00.27]Oh shit.
[132:02.17]Yeah.
[132:02.99]Soul fountains provide souls to the clan of its owner.
[132:05.31]To capture a soul fountain, dispatch all enemies in the immediate area, position your clan next to it for a time.
[132:10.48]When captured, the souls that are released will turn from red to blue.
[132:12.70]Okay, so are they going to get it?
[132:18.12]They're lying to everyone.
[132:20.94]I'm really not though.
[132:24.06]character's name and character's name it's just it was like a turn off for me all through my life we get it destroy the blade worms how am I gonna do that I have to actually go kill those things
[132:49.93]Dunk and Donuts.
[132:51.15]Dunkin' and Donuts.
[132:51.77]It's not Dunkin' and Donuts.
[132:53.11]It's Dunkin' Donuts.
[132:55.63]Like you're dunking your donut in the coffee.
[132:57.61]Dunk in Donuts.
[132:59.03]Not Dunk and Donuts.
[133:02.44]World and Warcraft.
[133:03.96]No.
[133:04.42]That's wrong too.
[133:05.00]Bill and Ted.
[133:09.90]I've never seen that for... I've never seen that movie start to finish ever.
[133:21.12]Hall of Titans.
[133:22.06]We must enlist a stone ogre to help with our work.
[133:29.37]I can have souls to enter the Hall of Titans and buy a stone ogre.
[133:35.71]How much do I need?
[133:40.57]I have to do it.
[133:41.09]I'm only going to do this one more time, I promise.
[133:50.74]No, I'm not gonna do it.
[133:53.36]Each clan will have one Titan and one turret associated with it available in the Hall of Titans.
[133:58.35]To buy a Titan, select the desired unit using the left thumbstick.
[134:03.15]When doing so, the unit's stats will be displayed at the bottom right of the screen.
[134:06.67]Cool.
[134:08.47]Yeah, they cost resources.
[134:09.60]We all know that.
[134:12.64]Alright, I have an ogre.
[134:21.31]Attack and Titan.
[134:24.67]Stewie and Brian.
[134:25.57]That's not the name of a show.
[134:28.24]That's the name of two characters.
[134:31.94]Lord and the Rings.
[134:35.50]Okay, would it be as popular as a series if it was called Lord and the Rings?
[134:41.39]I don't think so.
[134:48.89]Alright, we gotta go break this.
[134:50.31]Clear the debris and collect 125 gold.
[134:54.41]That still dramatically makes sense, by the way.
[134:57.04]Lord and the Rings.
[135:06.82]What about... What about Jerma and Styr?
[135:08.98]That wasn't the name of our YouTube channel.
[135:13.46]We just played a lot of stuff together.
[135:24.09]That's a lot of money.
[135:31.20]Might and Magic.
[135:32.70]Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
[135:35.14]No, I'm sorry.
[135:38.12]The name of that series is not Harry Potter and Ron Weasley.
[135:42.78]And it's not Harry Potter and Hermione Granger.
[135:47.40]I've got it wrong again.
[136:01.63]Who cares?
[136:02.19]Alright, stop.
[136:02.67]We gotta move off of this.
[136:03.49]I don't want to read any more ands.
[136:05.13]I don't want to read any more of these.
[136:09.46]I told you my theory and that's it.
[136:11.70]Ampersand Andy.
[136:15.58]Alright, we gotta kill.
[136:29.63]What do you mean?
[136:30.07]What are you doing?
[136:32.95]Return the commander to the Hall of Titans.
[136:35.15]Buy three rock lobbers and place them onto the glowing orbs.
[136:40.58]I think I already have them.
[136:45.16]Titans.
[136:46.68]Titans.
[136:49.61]Eren!
[136:49.97]Eren!
[136:50.77]Eren!
[136:51.67]Eren!
[136:52.35]Eren!
[136:53.65]Eren!
[136:54.21]Eren!
[136:54.73]Eren!
[136:59.91]I already have like five.
[137:07.91]I already have too many of these.
[137:09.80]Where do I put them?
[137:10.56]Where?
[137:10.74]Buy it.
[137:17.16]Oh, I have to buy a turret?
[137:21.52]Three rock lobbers?
[137:30.82]Oh, this is like blending in with the ground.
[137:32.86]Okay.
[137:33.72]And place them.
[137:45.71]Oh, come on.
[137:47.17]Alright, we're going to place them on the glowing orbs.
[137:54.17]Where is there a glowing orb?
[137:58.23]Ah.
[138:00.36]One.
[138:11.44]Finn and Jake.
[138:14.46]How many times do I have to say this?
[138:16.11]The name of that show is not Finn and Jake.
[138:19.65]It's Adventure Time.
[138:35.84]Jerma AND sucks.
[138:47.83]Yeah, Star Wars would have sucked.
[138:49.17]Nobody would have gone to the theater if it was called Luke and Darth Vader.
[138:54.47]None of you would have seen the movie.
[138:57.90]No one would have seen the movie, I'm telling you.
[139:14.27]I don't think those critters will be showing their thorny hides around here anytime soon.
[139:18.69]Great job.
[139:33.85]Gay and Silent Bob.
[139:35.01]Never watched it.
[139:36.27]I've not seen that movie.
[139:43.03]Netanyahu.
[139:45.88]What the?
[139:48.75]Great frocks.
[139:50.43]It's going to be another Titan.
[139:52.63]I hope.
[139:54.26]And then I can do my Armin voice at least another three times before I have to retire it forever because everybody hates it.
[140:17.97]What's next?
[140:18.81]Rescue the three trapped workers.
[140:20.07]Let's go.
[140:23.07]This game's actually really fun.
[140:24.73]I could see why people would play this a lot.
[140:27.25]But we're about to be done in like the next... I don't know.
[140:29.63]I don't know.
[140:30.09]30, 20 minutes?
[140:30.61]30 minutes?
[140:30.85]I don't know.
[140:31.72]I'm still enjoying it.
[140:32.42]I think it's cool.
[140:44.52]King in the Hill.
[140:45.74]It's King of the Hill.
[140:48.22]Seen many episodes of that show.
[140:49.92]Get him!
[140:54.04]Can I eat the big plant?
[140:57.62]Nice.
[140:57.84]Alright, we got one.
[141:06.39]Alvin and the chipmunks.
[141:10.44]Yes, and that is one of the most awful franchises ever.
[141:17.32]All the new movies.
[141:18.51]Are you trying to tell me to go see Alvin and the Chipmunks?
[141:21.39]That's not even right.
[141:22.95]You have it wrong again.
[141:24.73]It's not Alvin and Theodore.
[141:27.23]Or Alvin and Simon.
[141:28.29]It's Alvin and the Chipmunks.
[141:31.57]But we don't even have to talk about that because that whole franchise is dog shit.
[141:35.41]We don't even need to talk about it.
[141:43.84]That right off the bat is just a non-watch.
[141:58.21]How much off the deck for you to get an Alvin and the Chipmunks tattoo?
[142:06.35]It would take... Okay, I'll be honest with you.
[142:08.45]I'm going to be very honest with you.
[142:09.77]Let me be honest.
[142:10.75]Fine.
[142:11.47]Here's what that would take.
[142:12.89]For me to get an Alvin and the Chipmunks tattoo, and we're talking the 3D Alvin and the Chipmunks, which is way worse.
[142:19.98]The, like, Alvin and the Chipmunks from, like, the fucking 40s or whatever it was, like, the 60s.
[142:24.24]I don't even know when they first came out.
[142:26.09]That old style?
[142:27.71]Okay, cool.
[142:28.85]It's like, I'd be, like, getting Snap, Crackle, Pop tattooed on you.
[142:31.81]It's like, oh, alright, well, it's kind of weird, but, like, oh, whatever.
[142:33.84]It's, like, old, I guess.
[142:35.22]It's, like, an old thing.
[142:36.48]Getting the 3D...
[142:38.77]reimagination of those characters tattooed on my body, it would cost a million dollars.
[142:44.75]I would need one million dollars taxed.
[142:48.22]Taxed one million.
[142:49.96]Not one million.
[142:51.32]One million taxed already.
[142:53.38]So that would be like 1.4 million.
[142:55.60]1.5 million.
[142:58.62]It'd have to be taxed.
[143:04.44]That's what it would take.
[143:09.61]Deal, okay.
[143:10.89]No, no deal.
[143:11.81]I'm not agreeing to it.
[143:14.25]A face tattoo?
[143:15.59]No, not happening.
[143:17.40]There's no amount of money that would make me get a face tattoo.
[143:20.46]No amount.
[143:25.40]Set up a crowdfund and we'll get it to 1.4 million.
[143:27.54]No, you will not.
[143:28.38]That's a fucking absolute not.
[143:30.00]It would never happen.
[143:32.34]It would never happen.
[143:34.25]It would never happen.
[143:36.01]I am so convinced that that would never hit 1.4 million.
[143:46.79]It has to go on my back?
[143:48.83]Like on my lower back?
[143:51.33]No way.
[143:52.53]No fucking way.
[144:00.83]That's not even worth one point.
[144:03.85]It's not even worth one million taxed, by the way.
[144:06.47]Take.
[144:16.33]And it would have to be that image that's on all the posters.
[144:19.47]Where you got, like, Theodore on the left.
[144:22.75]Arms crossed, leaning back.
[144:24.81]Simon on the right.
[144:26.26]Arms crossed, leaning back.
[144:27.56]And Alvin in the middle.
[144:28.90]Arms crossed, leaning back with sunglasses on.
[144:33.04]3D.
[144:34.32]The 3D characters.
[144:37.84]I would need 1.4 million dollars to do that.
[144:42.34]Sit, sit, grabu.
[144:46.42]What about Wallace and Gromit?
[144:51.88]That probably wouldn't be a million.
[144:55.26]I don't think I would need a million for that.
[144:56.42]They're, like, cool.
[144:58.40]That's, like, classic characters.
[145:01.57]Alvin and Chipmunk are classic characters, but they're classic, like, money-grab characters.
[145:06.37]Like, they're like the Smurfs. ...
[145:16.33]They brought back all these new franchises to try to, like, make them for kids.
[145:23.71]Wallace and Gromit is timeless.
[145:24.91]You don't need to, like, remake Wallace and Gromit to cater to, like, a 10-year-old right now.
[145:31.31]You just make another Wallace and Gromit.
[145:32.81]You don't have to, like, remake and redesign them and bring them back for kids now.
[145:36.46]No, you just make another Wallace and Gromit.
[145:37.84]It's a timeless character.
[145:38.80]I would do that for fucking, I don't know.
[145:41.92]In that same spot?
[145:43.44]Eh, 500k?
[145:43.72]Taxed?
[145:52.79]It's a Stonecrusher clan shrine.
[146:01.84]Balls of Gromit holds up way more than it should.
[146:04.30]Why?
[146:04.70]That's cool.
[146:07.64]It's really cool.
[146:08.12]It's claymation, first of all.
[146:09.50]It's really well done claymation.
[146:11.90]The characters are funny.
[146:12.66]It's like an old man and his funny dog.
[146:15.26]And they go eat cheese from the moon and stuff.
[146:17.14]It's timeless.
[146:19.92]Going to the moon to try the planet's surface because you think it's cheese and watching him spread it on the cracker and eat it.
[146:29.17]I wanted to eat it so bad when I was younger.
[146:32.49]Watching him take that gray chunk of that cheese moon shit and biting it.
[146:37.29]Oh my God, I wanted it so bad.
[146:38.87]I wanted to eat that so bad.
[146:46.05]I don't have that reaction when I watch Alvin and the Chipmunks.
[146:50.33]Like, Lost at Sea, or whatever the new movie was.
[146:53.02]I don't know.
[146:59.34]I want better moves.
[147:03.64]Damon, I don't even like cheese.
[147:04.84]Yeah.
[147:05.08]Alright, what am I doing?
[147:08.94]Make contact with the Hellfire Clan.
[147:15.55]chip wrecked the name of the movie was chipwrecked that might be worse than putting two characters with and in the middle in fact it's absolutely it is I need resources hellfire clan attacking they really they're they're rallying around the soul fountain capture that soul
[147:48.46]I need the tattoo fundraiser link.
[147:51.47]That's not how this works.
[147:54.47]It's not, you guys make a fundraiser.
[147:56.93]No, it would be, I would have to have an official, an official account, an official Kickstarter campaign, or official campaign onto my account name to do it.
[148:10.01]If somebody makes an account, if somebody links you, I'm going to make this really clear.
[148:13.51]If someone links you an image, not an image, if somebody links you a link to a like fund page of me getting a Alvin and the Chipmunks ass tattoo, whatever it was, it's not real.
[148:26.08]It's only real when I tell you it's mine.
[148:29.30]Do not give any money to anybody.
[148:31.30]Don't give any money to anything.
[148:34.11]Only if I tell you it's my link and I link it and I'm the one that links it.
[148:38.65]Don't do that.
[148:40.13]Someone's going to steal your money.
[148:41.43]Don't fuck around.
[148:46.00]It has nothing to do with me and I am completely denouncing all of that.
[148:49.82]Don't do that.
[148:50.88]Don't fucking do it.
[148:52.70]I know one of you might think about it.
[148:56.66]I'll be furious if you do and I really mean that.
[149:01.70]I truly mean that.
[149:05.90]If I do it, you'll know.
[149:07.26]I'll have an official link in the channel.
[149:10.87]You'll know because I'll talk about it.
[149:12.25]I will say, here is the link for the $1.4 million to get the Alvin and the Chipmunks 3D ass tattoo or back tattoo.
[149:25.59]Here it is.
[149:27.79]You will only know that from me.
[149:36.03]spend this much time on this do I have to really spend this much time here why'd I have to spend this much time saying this huge omega lulls today
[150:00.34]You're gonna sober up tomorrow and regret this bit.
[150:02.48]I'm not fucking fine.
[150:04.70]I've been drinking water.
[150:06.51]Hellfire clan, seek blood.
[150:07.93]I didn't agree to anything.
[150:11.49]I just told you if that ever were to happen, it would be coming from me, and I have not agreed to that yet.
[150:24.94]Now we gotta find the encampment.
[150:29.95]Alright, I got a group here.
[150:32.67]Yet.
[150:33.25]I don't know.
[150:33.83]I don't know what I'm going to do.
[150:45.87]He's zonked.
[150:48.31]Get him!
[150:51.20]Okay, I can find their lumber camp.
[150:53.22]And take it over.
[151:01.58]this game is actually pretty fun could you play this online with somebody if you could that's really cool when he files for bankruptcy he'll be back to do that yeah by the way what's the um how long do I have to do this like if let's say I'm retired completely like five ten years go by
[151:25.70]And like, I'm like 50.
[151:27.18]I'm like 60.
[151:30.39]Can I come on Twitter and say, hey guys, I'm opening up the Kickstarter for the Alvin and the Chipmunks 3D lower back tattoo.
[151:41.40]Please contribute here.
[151:42.76]Would you guys still do it?
[151:45.93]No, what would happen realistically is that I would get like two retweets.
[151:50.73]And like four likes on that tweet.
[151:53.25]And there would be no replies.
[151:55.29]And no one would pay for it.
[151:56.55]You guys aren't going to be on Twitter anymore.
[151:59.24]It would be just a weird, desperate attempt for me to come back and just take money from people.
[152:07.38]That would be weird.
[152:15.66]Get a TimeSplitters tattoo.
[152:20.18]I don't... I'm not... I don't have any tattoos.
[152:25.49]I told you guys the tattoo that I was going to get a long time ago, but I never did it.
[152:28.75]And I'm kind of glad I didn't.
[152:30.83]I was going to get the Venom symbol on my shoulder.
[152:36.46]And I swear to God, something happens to your brain.
[152:39.14]When you get, like, jacked.
[152:41.94]Like, I was fucking huge.
[152:43.38]I was like 160, 170 pounds.
[152:46.05]And I'm like 5'8".
[152:46.87]I was an inflated, swole, fucking massive person.
[152:51.81]I was huge.
[152:52.25]And I was always lifting.
[152:53.39]I was really in shape.
[152:55.53]When you get like that, it does something to your brain.
[152:58.63]I'm gonna get, like, the Spider-Man tattoo.
[153:00.65]I'm Spider-Man.
[153:01.97]Like, I really thought that I was, like, Spider-Man.
[153:04.39]Yeah, this is, like, what Spider-Man looks like.
[153:06.27]I'm Spider-Man.
[153:07.83]I'm gonna get the Venom tattoo.
[153:09.27]Because I, like, look like Venom.
[153:12.15]I don't know what it does.
[153:12.81]It does something into, like, inside the chemistry in your brain.
[153:15.29]And it makes you, like, think you're a superhero or something.
[153:20.09]So I was gonna get the Venom symbol across the shoulder and, like, down around the back and around my arm.
[153:27.83]And it would have looked sick.
[153:29.73]With my shirt off, just jacked in the mirror.
[153:32.07]It would be those lines.
[153:34.39]And I'd be like, fuck yeah.
[153:36.43]I'd be at the beach.
[153:38.07]And I'd be like, wow, look at that.
[153:39.51]That guy's jacked.
[153:40.55]And he has a Venom tattoo.
[153:42.31]That guy's Venom.
[153:44.41]But I didn't want to be Venom.
[153:45.35]I wanted to be Venom Suit Spider-Man.
[153:49.62]I didn't want to be Venom.
[153:50.38]I wanted to be Spider-Man with the Venom suit on.
[153:55.52]But I'm glad I didn't.
[154:00.42]Because I've gotten a little frumpy, and that part of my brain turned off.
[154:06.42]I'm no longer like Jack Spider-Man.
[154:09.98]And I'd be like, ah, shit, I have this superhero tattoo now.
[154:13.49]Maybe I wouldn't have stopped.
[154:15.41]Maybe that would have been enough motivation for me to keep going to the gym.
[154:19.43]Maybe I fucked up.
[154:24.96]Maybe having the Venom tattoo on the shoulder was what needed to be there so I would continue to be Spider-Man in the Venom suit.
[154:33.63]Oh, well.
[154:44.47]That's like getting a marijuana leaf tattooed on you because you like weed.
[154:58.00]Well, but why does anybody get a tattoo?
[155:01.08]Like, why does anybody get, like, a tattoo like that?
[155:04.46]It's because, like, you, I don't know, it's, like, cool.
[155:06.64]Or it means something, right?
[155:16.65]Weed tattoo for two million.
[155:18.75]Nah, that's not, that's, like, not that big of a deal.
[155:29.79]You know, a long time ago, Burgah Boy was going to get Wario tattooed on his ass.
[155:34.93]Shooting a fireball, like, towards his, like, butt.
[155:41.20]That didn't happen.
[155:51.72]It would have been, yeah, it would have been glorious.
[155:54.18]But that's the kind of tattoo, that's like, okay, that's like funny and like, wow, what an interesting person you must have been, right?
[156:00.72]Like, what a crazy, cool, fun life you may have had, right?
[156:04.60]Getting like the Spider-Man tattoo on your shoulder is like, I'm jacked.
[156:12.41]In my brain, at least.
[156:14.47]How much for a twitch.tv tattoo?
[156:15.97]What do you mean?
[156:20.27]Like the Twitch, like the, whatever, the glitchy, the icon?
[156:28.00]I'd rather get Alvin and the Chipmunks.
[156:31.93]I would rather get Alvin and the Chipmunks for free.
[156:34.75]On the lower back.
[156:36.05]Than get a twitch.tv glitch tattoo.
[156:38.19]For money.
[156:39.63]I don't know.
[156:48.75]I don't know.
[156:50.19]Something about that just sits weird to me.
[156:55.73]I don't know why.
[156:56.47]Like, I just feel like... I feel like that's a kind of... Oh, I beat it.
[157:01.97]Where would it be?
[157:02.91]How big does it have to be?
[157:05.84]The Twitch glitch tattoo.
[157:08.02]How big does that have to be?
[157:11.52]Because if it was small, like, if it was, like, emote-sized or something, that would be kind of cute.
[157:16.52]Like, get that, like, on, like, your wrist or something.
[157:19.32]Or on, like, your forearm.
[157:20.20]Like, that's cute.
[157:21.10]I don't have a problem with that.
[157:23.14]How big does it have to be?
[157:30.78]Huge.
[157:33.24]No, I don't think I'd want to do it.
[157:39.63]On your forehead?
[157:40.49]No.
[157:42.31]I wouldn't get any tattoo on my forehead.
[157:43.76]What happened?
[157:49.12]Oh, I hit B. Oops.
[157:59.50]Oink, oink, boom.
[158:01.84]On your cheek.
[158:10.03]On your bald spot.
[158:11.17]I don't have a bald spot.
[158:17.71]Inner lip?
[158:18.63]Ow.
[158:18.95]No, I don't think so.
[158:19.81]No thanks. ...
[158:31.50]Which URL?
[158:33.78]No, I don't want that.
[158:34.84]Because that's not going to be... That's a weird advertisement for something that's not going to exist anymore.
[158:40.35]Eventually.
[158:49.00]Why'd you do that?
[158:50.84]QR code tattoo?
[158:53.98]Yeah, and it links to Rick Roll.
[158:59.76]Can't wait to do that a thousand times.
[159:06.32]Alright, so now, investigate the Hellfire Gunpowder Factory.
[159:11.20]Not yet.
[159:13.00]I want one of these guys.
[159:13.72]140?
[159:13.76]Alright.
[159:16.42]I'm gonna... I own this factory, right?
[159:19.08]Yeah.
[159:25.12]Ooh, that's new.
[159:29.41]Medium melee.
[159:32.38]Alright.
[159:32.60]That's a good group.
[159:33.52]Tons of health.
[159:37.50]Let's go find it.
[159:38.00]What about a rat tattoo?
[159:43.13]That would be fun.
[159:44.33]I wouldn't be opposed to that.
[160:02.97]What just happened?
[160:05.68]I was laughing about chipwrecked.
[160:12.54]Can these guys eat?
[160:24.39]I'm going to get Jack and Dexter tattooed on my back.
[160:30.64]He's going to be holding the chicken gun.
[160:39.89]This is the chainsaw sound.
[160:48.91]I need more people.
[160:50.42]Hold on.
[160:51.06]Keep fighting.
[160:58.85]Everybody died.
[160:59.41]Oh, it's because the factory blew up.
[161:05.86]Homer Simpson.
[161:06.82]Yes, I'll get... Okay, Homer Simpson holding the pink donut, standing straight up, heels on the ground, just standing in just a regular position with his arm up.
[161:17.37]Pink donut has a single bite out of it.
[161:19.79]Frosting side is facing the camera and he has a little wad chew kind of in his mouth, side of his mouth.
[161:35.83]That's pretty epic, yeah.
[161:39.71]Gonzo the Great Tattoo, and you're... Oh my god.
[161:49.21]Like, that's the kind of tattoo that you just get up one day, and you're like, what the fuck is going on with my life?
[161:58.28]What's happening to my... What's going on?
[162:00.32]Right?
[162:04.58]Right?
[162:06.96]Investigate the gunpowder factory.
[162:08.44]Okay, let's go.
[162:20.21]Go back to Sneak King.
[162:21.11]We're going to move on to the next game.
[162:22.83]And the next game is going to lock me there for a long time.
[162:25.45]I think half of you are going to be very excited.
[162:27.93]And the other half are going to be very pissed off that I even picked it in the first place.
[162:33.47]I guarantee, 100% guarantee, this game will be played for at least a full hour.
[162:40.42]I guarantee it.
[162:44.28]It's guaranteed.
[162:45.14]Somebody's still fighting back here.
[162:51.20]Wait, hey, that's mine.
[162:52.04]Give me that.
[162:55.01]Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[162:58.13]Can't see anything.
[163:03.59]It's not Skylanders.
[163:04.49]Don't you guys feel like Skylanders was like five years a little too early?
[163:19.44]Just barely.
[163:20.18]I still have that, right?
[163:24.56]I think so.
[163:27.65]Don't have it?
[163:32.00]140, almost gonna get the, uh, the ogre.
[163:33.58]Like, if they had just waited for technology to get just a little bit better, even, it probably would have been a thousand times more popular than it is now.
[163:45.97]Or than it was.
[163:46.39]Cool, give me that.
[163:57.41]You have to claim sponsorship money?
[163:58.71]That's what we're gonna watch?
[164:01.55]um no alright bring on the big guy not around anymore let's go game part of it sucked I didn't play skylanders I just knew what it was I was like oh that's kind of interesting how that works
[164:31.75]I can just eat people.
[164:35.13]Why play as any other character?
[164:36.22]This is so much better.
[164:40.02]Do I lose health for eating these guys?
[164:51.00]No.
[164:51.16]Alright, you stay here and claim this.
[164:55.95]Can he claim this by himself?
[165:01.05]Later levels get really hard to make kids spend money.
[165:06.24]Kind of weird to hear.
[165:11.16]Oh, shit.
[165:11.42]Alright, go get him.
[165:15.66]Are they dead?
[165:22.41]Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[165:23.31]Don't do this.
[165:23.79]I got to get more troops.
[165:25.59]Upgrade their gear.
[165:26.29]What am I doing?
[165:31.77]Yeah, look at that.
[165:37.03]Now we're going to take it over.
[165:38.51]When is the next game?
[165:40.87]After my first break, which will be in precisely after this level.
[165:45.49]I'm going to go pee and come back, and we're going to move to the next game.
[165:49.36]The next game is going to be, wow.
[165:53.62]Really wonder what the response will be.
[165:59.18]Oh, what?
[165:59.42]They're already going over there.
[166:00.50]Shit.
[166:01.26]Hurry up.
[166:08.13]Eat.
[166:10.39]Eat them both.
[166:10.79]They'll take it over.
[166:11.35]This game's pretty fun.
[166:15.82]I could see how this would be really popular.
[166:17.10]I'm coming.
[166:19.62]I don't know.
[166:24.18]Fit here?
[166:30.18]Wow.
[166:30.50]Let's go.
[166:30.92]It's not World of Warcraft.
[166:34.63]It's not an MMO.
[166:39.09]What, you think I would do that to you right now?
[166:43.49]On like the one stream you get a week, you think I'm going to play World of Warcraft for like two hours?
[166:47.40]Alright, where's this gunpowder place?
[166:54.18]Okay, I will make somebody... I'm going to make sure I'm going to make everybody really, really calm here.
[167:06.00]It's not League of Legends.
[167:07.12]If you think it's League of Legends, and you're like, God damn it, it's probably League.
[167:10.96]He's gonna do a stupid joke where he plays League.
[167:12.72]He's like, oh, once a week, and he plays League.
[167:15.24]If League of Legends shows up on this stream, I will get the Alvin and the Chipmunks 3D ass tattoo for free.
[167:22.97]Like, immediately the next day.
[167:26.57]If you see League of Legends show up on this stream...
[167:30.54]And what I mean by that is me playing League of Legends.
[167:34.90]I'm playing it.
[167:36.18]Sitting there.
[167:36.88]And, oh yeah, League of Legends.
[167:38.20]Cool, this is fun.
[167:38.80]I'm playing the game.
[167:39.78]Me streaming it.
[167:41.40]Not opening a video.
[167:43.20]Not talking about it.
[167:45.36]I mean physically sitting here playing League of Legends on my twitch.tv.
[167:49.82]Okay, where I am playing the game.
[167:51.11]Me.
[167:54.20]If that happens, I will get the Alvin and the Chipmunks ass tattoo the next step.
[167:58.42]Now, why is it always ass?
[167:59.39]It's like back.
[167:59.97]I keep saying ass.
[168:04.21]He wants an ass tattoo.
[168:05.93]Perhaps there is another way.
[168:25.58]We still have not forgotten about three stooges in Fortnite.
[168:29.30]It's gonna happen!
[168:30.00]It doesn't- I could take a- I could take five more years.
[168:32.38]It's gonna happen.
[168:43.21]It's gonna- they're gonna open up like- Oh!
[168:45.09]Season 8!
[168:46.99]Season 10!
[168:47.73]Like- It's gonna be black and white.
[168:53.11]It's gonna open up black and white.
[168:59.14]They're going to come over and they're going to like... They're on season 18.
[169:05.06]That's too much.
[169:09.38]That's too many seasons.
[169:11.30]They're breaking the rule.
[169:12.92]More than seven seasons of any media, it becomes bad.
[169:15.85]We talked about this like a week ago.
[169:17.15]We already talked about it.
[169:18.11]Do I have to reiterate it for you?
[169:25.05]Collect this.
[169:33.38]I'm for a reboot.
[169:35.48]I assume they've rebooted Fortnite.
[169:40.31]Destroy it!
[169:40.83]Alright, kill these guys.
[169:42.51]Fuck.
[169:47.59]Alright, I'll get it next time.
[169:48.99]Maybe not.
[169:49.49]Maybe I can do it now.
[169:53.54]You stole that bit from Community.
[169:56.80]I've never seen Community.
[169:59.16]I've seen one episode of Community.
[170:02.54]It's the one where they talk about, like, the chicken fingers being back at, like, the cafeteria or something.
[170:07.73]I was like, oh, alright, this is kind of funny.
[170:09.83]I've only seen one full episode, maybe two.
[170:17.15]That was good.
[170:18.81]It was very funny.
[170:20.77]That's the only, like, I've only seen two episodes.
[170:24.67]I don't really watch TV.
[170:26.14]I don't do, guys, I don't watch, like, media.
[170:30.10]I'm such a weirdo.
[170:31.84]Oh my god, I'm so weird.
[170:33.06]I'm such a weirdo.
[170:33.86]Alright, they have molten hammers.
[170:49.63]You can't get much better than that.
[170:55.68]Where'd he come to me?
[171:08.30]You have to watch this guy.
[171:09.04]He's so quirky.
[171:09.71]I know.
[171:14.48]Dude, you gotta watch this guy.
[171:15.46]He was wicked funny.
[171:16.62]He was doing a routine where he said the Three Stooges were gonna go and put it into Fortnite.
[171:22.93]He has this bet with his chat.
[171:24.77]And he started playing a song.
[171:25.95]He started doing the Willy Wonka Golden Ticket song as if it was a Three Stooges intro or something.
[171:32.03]Like, how does this guy's mind work?
[171:33.85]Like, what the heck?
[171:35.49]That's so weird.
[171:36.35]What the hell?
[171:37.35]That's not even the right thing.
[171:48.31]Final battle incoming.
[171:49.41]Troll versus troll.
[171:52.01]Ear piggy, piggy, piggy.
[171:57.66]Yep, let's go.
[172:05.38]Go!
[172:19.62]Yeah!
[172:46.00]That just gave me a headache.
[172:47.36]I'm sorry.
[172:49.26]I'm sorry that gave you a headache.
[172:51.89]Why did that give you a headache?
[172:53.35]Are you alright?
[172:55.03]Does he listen to Pokémon music before streams?
[173:07.82]I've never played a Pokémon game.
[173:10.50]I'm just mashing together the things that... It's like an AI algorithm in my brain.
[173:15.96]I took what I played in the Smash Brothers games, the background music that was Pokémon related, and AI quantum imagination created it.
[173:28.13]I've got a quantum fucking imagination.
[173:30.73]I've never played a Pokémon game.
[173:40.54]Oh, watch out for the explosion.
[173:41.56]I need to eat something.
[173:47.44]Everybody fine.
[173:48.52]Everybody's fine.
[173:49.20]Just take out their... Take this out.
[174:02.73]Oi!
[174:02.91]Oi!
[174:16.45]Alright, no more of that.
[174:17.15]They have cannons.
[174:25.00]It's not fair.
[174:25.70]I'm about to quit the game.
[174:28.90]Not yet.
[174:32.60]They fully upgraded.
[174:33.58]Why can I only have 10?
[174:34.08]These guys attack.
[174:41.67]These guys' defense is terrible.
[174:43.23]Can I upgrade these guys at all?
[174:48.88]Where can I put this?
[174:49.48]I can put this near a fountain, right?
[174:59.44]Stay with this guy.
[175:00.66]Don't do that.
[175:14.05]I can remember every Pokémon Smash background music, but can't remember the U.S.
[175:18.07]national anthem.
[175:19.44]What a liberal.
[175:25.94]That doesn't... Okay, the Pokémon background music, battle music, doesn't have lyrics.
[175:34.68]I can go... I can do that.
[175:50.17]I can- I don't need lyrics.
[176:02.72]I'm a bird.
[176:03.62]I just repeat things.
[176:07.22]I can just repeat sounds.
[176:10.64]Alright, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[176:11.68]Come this way, this way, this way.
[176:12.77]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[176:16.81]Oh, goddammit!
[176:17.85]Head to the cannon!
[176:27.64]Rush!
[176:33.88]This game is a snoozefest, bro.
[176:37.32]Ban him.
[176:37.80]Ban him and don't let him come back!
[176:39.15]Ban him and don't let him come back!
[176:43.98]This is my... You're going to mess with my stream and talk about how the game I'm playing is not good?
[176:57.22]It's what I think is fun and good, okay?
[176:59.84]Get out of here.
[177:00.92]Get out of here.
[177:13.69]It's boring.
[177:15.49]Well, it doesn't matter.
[177:16.27]We're just having fun.
[177:17.03]It's Xbox 360 night.
[177:20.72]I'm just stalling to get to the real game.
[177:22.20]Because that's the game that's going to... I'm going to get trapped for at least a few hours.
[177:35.36]This game's pretty fun.
[177:38.55]That's Marcy do, Jacker.
[177:41.21]Faramay do.
[177:48.97]Did anybody find that clip yet of the Joe and Mac?
[177:54.85]I like love that game and I love that sound.
[177:56.95]Oh, that's a Joe and Mac.
[178:04.64]Oh, I think, yeah, I lose.
[178:10.30]I lose.
[178:11.12]Gotta get the Alvin the Chipmunk's ass tattoo.
[178:13.39]I lose.
[178:22.08]Just trying to find reasons to get the tattoo.
[178:26.42]Oh, shit.
[178:27.28]Oh, man.
[178:27.88]I lost.
[178:28.24]Oh, I have to get the Alvin the Chipmunk's tattoo on my ass.
[178:31.21]Oh, what the heck?
[178:32.33]That's so stupid.
[178:33.15]That sucks.
[178:35.23]Fine.
[178:35.53]I'll book it tomorrow.
[178:37.21]Oh, no.
[178:38.89]What can I do?
[178:39.45]Is there something I can do to make that not happen?
[178:45.68]Alright, let's go.
[178:46.20]This was fun, but we're moving on.
[178:48.34]And I'm not going to even tell you what this is until you fucking see it.
[178:50.92]So let's go BRB and I'm going to open up on the next game.
[178:53.05]Everyone's going to be furious or happy.
[178:55.71]Not sure.
[178:56.01]See you in a minute.
[185:45.03]Okay, I'm back.
[185:45.80]Alright, that took a little longer and really wanted I wanted another coffee.
[185:52.44]One of the coffee and I was gonna make it.
[185:54.68]So I did.
[185:57.00]Okay, so the next game we're gonna play, I will put on the music.
[186:02.13]So you can hear what the intro is.
[186:05.59]This is the next thing I'm going to be doing.
[186:06.89]This is the opening.
[186:14.50]What could that be?
[186:15.10]Yes, you can.
[186:29.23]You can hear it.
[186:31.13]No sound.
[186:31.73]Yes, you can hear this.
[186:32.79]What do you mean you can't hear this?
[186:40.04]It says you can.
[186:40.68]There's literally no sound.
[186:43.90]What?
[186:46.63]Well, alright, who cares about the surprise?
[186:50.14]It's High Rollers Casino.
[186:52.60]Where you walk around and you play casino games!
[186:56.42]Ho ho ho ho, here we go!
[186:59.26]Get yourselves ready!
[187:00.70]I got a coffee for this one.
[187:01.78]This is the game of the night right here.
[187:08.62]You couldn't hear this intro?
[187:11.69]Oh no no no no, no spoilers.
[187:12.63]I don't want any spoilers.
[187:15.09]This screen looks fucked up, though.
[187:22.45]Like, not... Hold on.
[187:28.18]What I mean is, like, the bars on the bottom and top are too big.
[187:30.30]Is that good?
[187:35.30]How's that look?
[187:41.45]Looks better, right?
[187:44.21]One more to the left.
[187:47.77]Good.
[187:52.78]IGN gave this game a 1 out of 10.
[187:54.74]Did they really?
[187:55.48]Oh, here I am.
[188:00.84]Alright.
[188:01.62]This is important.
[188:17.72]It's just like a guy.
[188:29.13]It's just hair color.
[188:29.97]Hold on.
[188:31.63]Wait, wait, wait.
[188:32.59]Hold on.
[188:37.96]Oh, God.
[188:38.36]It's like Sims 2 characters.
[188:41.98]I like that a lot.
[188:42.88]This is my favorite one so far.
[188:49.16]green green come on it's got to be green pants yes of course there is wait wait why can you do this is that as far as it can go okay that's as high as it goes mix and match
[189:19.62]Fuck.
[189:22.22]This is a slot machine.
[189:23.56]I'm making a random person.
[189:29.14]No, we need green pants.
[189:30.65]Locked.
[189:38.41]I don't know.
[189:39.73]How do you do hair with bald?
[189:42.54]I think that was a good one.
[189:46.32]Yeah, I like it.
[189:49.88]Shorts are locked.
[189:54.95]Okay, there's greens.
[189:55.73]There's greens.
[189:59.63]Looks like a Chad.
[190:00.71]He needs a tie.
[190:03.29]I can't do anything about that.
[190:10.42]Oh, I guess it could be.
[190:11.34]Hold on.
[190:11.62]It could be this.
[190:12.24]That's fine.
[190:12.88]Let's go.
[190:21.86]Alright, are you ready to start our journey to go into the casino?
[190:28.85]I can't make him any fatter, I tried.
[190:36.69]Alright, I have $1,000 in bankroll.
[190:40.97]It's a third-person game.
[190:42.19]Where should I go?
[190:48.41]I feel like I'm just taking control of the character.
[190:51.14]One of the characters in Casino Inc.
[190:53.74]What should I start with?
[190:54.32]Should I go to the manager?
[190:55.86]Alright, I'm going to talk to the manager.
[190:58.36]Welcome to the High Rollers Casino.
[191:00.32]See me again if you want to enter a tournament.
[191:02.18]Check out the special tournament bonus prizes or if you need to pick up a VIP card.
[191:06.99]Remember to go to the elevator to your left if you want to go to your room and change your clothing.
[191:11.11]Alright, I don't...
[191:18.64]Alright, we're going to the slots first.
[191:20.60]Press A to play Burger Gym.
[191:24.02]Burger Gym is the first game.
[191:26.20]You gotta go to the first game that you see.
[191:29.47]Is this Dead Rising?
[191:33.19]What's Burger Gym?
[191:36.05]I have to be careful.
[191:37.11]Denomination.
[191:38.45]What's my denomination?
[191:40.37]No, I don't want to do $25.
[191:41.84]Go back.
[191:42.84]And what did I just do?
[191:44.84]How do I go back?
[191:48.66]Why does it have $250 spin?
[191:53.81]I didn't want to do that.
[191:57.93]Cash.
[192:00.26]Next.
[192:01.20]This is the worst.
[192:05.62]Okay, I want to do nine lines.
[192:07.12]I don't want to do 25 cents.
[192:13.11]Stop!
[192:13.45]What the fuck?
[192:14.32]I'm no- I thought that said- I thought that said to the coins.
[192:17.74]Like, two coins.
[192:19.22]Go that way to go to the coins.
[192:21.86]How do I change that?
[192:27.84]Whoa!
[192:29.46]Did I win?
[192:34.43]Did I win anything?
[192:35.11]What did I win?
[192:39.47]Casino.
[192:40.13]Warp to game.
[192:40.89]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[192:42.88]How do I change this?
[192:43.68]Bet 1.
[192:47.20]Line bet.
[192:48.22]You can do 10 coins a line.
[192:51.98]It was $4.
[192:53.16]That's horrible.
[192:53.96]I have to delete my save and do it again.
[193:00.43]I'm confused what's going on.
[193:01.51]Bet 1.
[193:06.27]What happened?
[193:11.58]What's going on?
[193:12.40]What did I just do?
[193:15.76]Cash out.
[193:16.32]Alright, get off of $25 a spin.
[193:18.39]No, don't leave the casino.
[193:22.57]I want to get up, get up, go to the casino floor.
[193:24.29]You're going to pre-record the stream.
[193:34.28]Why leave this shit in?
[193:38.80]That was fucking funny.
[193:40.42]It's true though.
[193:41.02]Alright, back to Burger Jam.
[193:43.95]This is a really weird UI.
[193:49.87]I'll get used to it.
[193:51.63]Okay, denomination.
[193:53.43]I want to do... 5 cent denomination.
[193:56.60]10 coins.
[194:01.40]I want to do... How many?
[194:05.00]What's the max bet I can do?
[194:08.70]How many bets?
[194:09.28]What's the max bet I can do?
[194:16.19]How many times can I do this?
[194:18.47]What's the max bet?
[194:28.63]Okay, whatever.
[194:29.15]Okay.
[194:29.67]Ten coins.
[194:31.13]Oh, bet max.
[194:32.27]Line bet.
[194:32.87]Alright, I want all lines.
[194:35.91]All nine lines.
[194:39.62]Oh.
[194:43.16]That's a must, it's gonna be huge.
[194:52.61]Again.
[194:52.85]Again.
[194:53.53]Why's my bankroll not going down?
[194:58.69]Why's my bankroll not going down?
[195:09.96]Top left?
[195:10.36]Yeah, bankroll $799.25.
[195:11.65]How come I'm not spending any money?
[195:18.79]It's... Oh, my credits.
[195:20.51]Okay.
[195:24.74]I got a thousand bucks in there.
[195:31.26]Okay.
[195:33.20]Next, I want... What's bet max?
[195:35.95]Alright, this is max bet.
[195:36.71]Let's go.
[195:40.39]Again.
[195:41.83]It's like $80 a spin.
[195:43.22]These are credits.
[195:53.14]No, it's currency.
[195:55.14]Each credit is five cents.
[195:58.13]And I'm doing ten.
[195:58.83]Okay, I get it.
[196:00.59]It's cake.
[196:03.23]What?
[196:05.63]Nine lines, right?
[196:06.43]How is that not a line?
[196:07.23]That's a line?
[196:15.43]These are $5 spins?
[196:16.99]Scatter!
[196:19.75]Oh, baby.
[196:22.21]Fake excitement.
[196:24.15]Choose three items.
[196:29.07]You're losing credits.
[196:30.36]No, I'm not.
[196:31.98]Alright.
[196:32.18]Should I do the Spanish burger or the kid's meal?
[196:33.92]The kid's meal.
[196:36.04]There it is. $1,350.
[196:42.52]Uh, the Max Burger.
[196:46.44]Triple Meat Burger?
[196:47.48]That was probably the worst one.
[196:50.12]Alright.
[196:51.28]What's that get me?
[196:55.04]That's like 2,000 credits.
[196:56.96]Alright, cash out.
[197:03.33]What?
[197:03.57]Alright, Burger Jim sucks.
[197:14.89]They're worth five cents each.
[197:17.41]Oh.
[197:18.73]You started with $8.50.
[197:19.78]I started with $1,000.
[197:20.92]And I accidentally did a $250 bet.
[197:24.34]Alright, Burger Gym's not fun.
[197:28.32]You guys are all idiots for playing Burger Gym.
[197:31.14]It's the worst one.
[197:31.90]Rock and roll, though, on the other hand.
[197:34.20]Alright, rock and roll.
[197:38.82]You are a human being with access to a computer, which you appear to be.
[197:42.92]There are a hundred million programs that can do this better.
[197:45.20]Before you seek them out, please set me on fire so the pain stops.
[197:48.59]That's an IGN review?
[197:49.75]Okay, about 25 cents a line.
[197:55.63]Alright, we're gonna do... I just cashed it out.
[198:08.10]This is so horrible.
[198:09.20]10 coins.
[198:14.38]Alright, so I have 200 credits.
[198:16.74]I want to bet on all nine lines.
[198:22.26]Good.
[198:22.88]Go.
[198:24.18]Big money right there.
[198:27.46]Big, big, big money.
[198:29.78]How do you lose so much?
[198:30.72]I don't even know how this works.
[198:36.57]Max bet.
[198:41.62]I win?
[198:44.36]The same game.
[198:45.24]I miss Burger Jim.
[198:55.32]This doesn't make any... This is needlessly complicated.
[199:01.22]Yeah, why?
[199:01.84]This is very needlessly complicated.
[199:10.42]For some reason, this game makes me feel really sad.
[199:14.00]It does?
[199:15.32]Why?
[199:15.64]It makes you sad?
[199:20.04]Bonus rock.
[199:23.33]Come on.
[199:23.61]I just got scatter.
[199:25.55]What happened?
[199:26.03]I just won a bunch of money.
[199:29.37]I'm up.
[199:29.97]I'm up almost 100 bucks.
[199:34.23]Alright.
[199:34.89]Let's keep going.
[199:36.53]What else is here?
[199:43.54]It's like 30 games to play.
[199:48.61]I would rather watch the Templar game, honestly.
[199:50.61]Oh, shit.
[199:56.03]Come on.
[199:57.65]I saw the third person guy walking around Casino.
[200:00.39]I had to get it.
[200:01.75]Alright, what about Fruits Jackpot?
[200:04.59]It's gonna be the same one, isn't it?
[200:19.25]This is 10 bucks, right?
[200:20.75]No, how much is that?
[200:21.59]50?
[200:23.91]Oh, fuck.
[200:24.39]Okay, this is a lot of money.
[200:34.61]Nice.
[200:35.21]Alright.
[200:38.19]This sucks.
[200:39.27]Stop.
[200:39.77]Wait.
[200:40.39]Let me at least get to a million.
[200:41.51]That's not going to happen, man.
[200:51.84]Let me at least play Blackjack.
[200:54.12]Remember, this is a bargain bin stream.
[200:56.76]It's original Xbox.
[200:59.76]I didn't get a bonus?
[201:03.00]Alright, this game, the game sucks, okay?
[201:09.01]The game sucks.
[201:09.77]It's terrible.
[201:11.37]It's awful.
[201:15.41]I'll give that, alright, I'll give that to you.
[201:16.69]Hold on, let me just push more coins in here.
[201:40.42]This game's bad.
[201:41.24]It's really bad.
[201:47.89]I've been playing for 10 minutes.
[201:49.01]We need another 20 minutes.
[201:53.37]Slots are so confusing.
[201:55.05]Well, they're not really.
[201:56.05]It's just for some reason this game decided to... I don't know why they added all these weird things to do.
[202:03.54]What does it describe the taste?
[202:05.76]Um... I'm like pissed.
[202:07.78]Look at my guy.
[202:11.07]I'm crying!
[202:13.03]No, this is- I don't like this.
[202:17.87]We gotta go to the blackjack table.
[202:23.43]I'm fucking furious.
[202:25.87]Blackjack.
[202:28.65]One dollars to- alright, this is- this makes much more sense to me.
[202:35.47]What happens if I get to zero?
[202:39.43]1 billion off the debt if you can make it to 1 million from your current bankroll.
[202:42.31]Okay, here we go.
[202:47.15]Add.

[203:16.58]What?

[203:23.92]You stand against the sticks.
[203:27.33]And I fucking lost!
[203:36.83]It's 11 versus 8.
[203:37.45]I'm probably 18.
[203:44.80]This game is just terrible.
[203:46.00]Stay.
[204:00.20]What the fuck?
[204:01.24]Come on, I gotta get to a million.
[204:03.80]Walking into a casino with a hundred bucks and going, I can't wait to turn this into a million!
[204:10.47]That's, um, that's not, that's not, that's very bad.
[204:13.57]That's not gonna happen.
[204:14.95]That's blackjack.
[204:15.59]Should've bet even more.
[204:16.35]Alright, we're good.
[204:18.79]We're good.
[204:19.17]This is the very bottom.

[204:37.10]Play this all night, please.
[204:38.60]I don't think I want to do that.
[204:40.01]I have to hit against a 9.
[204:41.19]I'm never going to the casino ever again.
[204:43.63]Please reconnect the controller.
[204:45.71]I'm out of batteries?
[204:49.87]What did I do?
[204:54.99]I should... Do the voice.
[205:03.64]15 versus a 4.
[205:04.80]This sucks, but I'm staying.
[205:08.50]No!
[205:10.84]I have to make a new character.
[205:11.86]17 versus a 4.
[205:19.78]I have to stay.
[205:23.30]You didn't hit on 15.
[205:24.52]Why would I hit on 15 versus a 4?
[205:26.06]Are you trying to get me fucking slaughtered?
[205:28.44]Alright, we're good.
[205:32.78]Wait, how much money?
[205:33.62]The person lost $2?
[205:34.80]Am I the weirdo at the table that's doing $50 a bet every hand?
[205:44.63]Oh, shit.
[205:47.89]People are just here having fun, and I'm like, $50 again.
[205:52.82]Yay.
[205:52.90]There it is.

[205:56.62]I'll take the 20.
[205:57.18]Thank you.
[205:57.56]And then I'm going to take it right back to the slot.
[205:59.86]I think I left.
[206:29.16]$1.
[206:30.20]Everyone's betting $1 here, but I'm betting $50.
[206:34.08]No!
[206:35.28]I don't want insurance.
[206:36.72]I want to... Alright, should I double down?
[206:42.41]What do you think?
[206:43.77]I guess an ace, that's the stupidest fucking thing ever.

[207:07.63]This is honestly so hype.
[207:08.67]I don't know why.
[207:09.19]Because I'm going to get back to 1,000.
[207:10.81]I'm going to get to like 5,000.
[207:12.73]I'm going to go to the high roller room and play $1,000 hands.

[207:35.59]This, like, four zeros have to get added.
[207:37.23]I gotta... I have to get there.
[207:38.29]Player has a nine.
[207:45.33]Alright, I'll get a 10 here.

[209:14.18]Oh my fucking god, this is terrible.
[209:15.68]Oh my fucking lord.
[209:19.67]Why would you stand against a king?
[209:22.55]Are you out of your mind?
[209:23.67]Why would I stand with a 12 or a 13 against a king?
[209:29.03]Give me a chance.

[210:26.96]Not AI, dogshit UI at the slot machine and blew through like $400 and I didn't even know I was doing that.
[210:32.30]That's not- no.
[210:33.20]I get to do it again.
[210:37.96]I didn't understand the game.
[210:39.02]I want my money back.
[210:40.28]Yeah, but whatever.
[210:42.82]Let's go.
[210:43.28]This is it.

[212:02.74]Where's the elevator?
[212:03.44]To the left over here?
[212:12.23]Alright, elevators are there.
[212:13.81]Maybe there's money in my room.
[212:19.39]Oh, there's a three line.
[212:20.25]Okay, I want to play those.
[212:21.41]No, I get to redo it again.

[213:23.40]I understand this one.
[213:24.84]Why do I have 10 cents?
[213:39.26]You found a dime on the ground.
[213:46.42]Okay, I need to find a five cent machine to put two coins in it.
[213:57.89]I don't understand how you're supposed to keep playing the game after you get to zero.
[214:03.41]Why am I still here?
[214:04.11]I'm just gonna walk around the casino with no money?
[214:15.45]Get a marker from the cashier.

[225:22.13]This is just... I'm sitting at a machine just losing $100... $500.
[225:25.07]That's it.
[225:26.13]There's nothing else going on.
[225:32.34]Just watch me lose at a casino.
[225:39.33]No shit, I wanted to select that.
[225:41.67]Oh my god.
[225:42.43]Full house.
[225:44.87]This is the turnaround right here.
[225:46.59]There it is.
[225:49.47]What'd I get for that?
[225:50.99]I lost 100 bucks, that's what I got.
[225:53.79]New game.
[226:01.23]You should have listened to IGN.
[226:04.51]Return to Vegas Steaks.
[226:05.53]I beat Vegas Steaks.
[226:06.52]I got to like 10 million dollars in Vegas Steaks.
[226:17.52]This is a very good anti-gambling PSA.
[226:19.66]Yes, it should be.
[226:21.66]If you go to a casino, you are going there to entertain yourself.
[226:24.66]You're not going there to make money.
[226:27.81]It's there for entertainment value.
[226:31.81]When you go into a casino, any money that is in your pocket is not coming back with you.
[226:39.55]That's how you should look at it.
[226:41.41]You are there to entertain yourself and maybe a group of friends.
[226:45.70]That's it.
[226:48.70]Whatever is in your pocket, you should assume right off the bat is not going to come home.
[226:51.98]At all.
[226:53.22]Let's go.
[226:58.07]This is where the big plays happen.
[226:59.17]Right here.
[226:59.45]That's 18.
[226:59.83]Bingo.
[227:00.13]Right off the bat.
[227:01.67]Done.
[227:02.11]Got it.
[227:02.93]There it is.
[227:07.79]This is where it begins.
[227:13.27]You suck.
[227:17.39]Hey, shit.
[227:20.51]Come on.
[227:22.11]No!
[227:22.71]Hit again.
[227:23.01]Oh, fuck you, video game.
[227:25.60]I have to hit again.
[227:27.68]Oh, I have to.
[227:28.22]I have to, right?
[227:28.98]I have to.
[227:32.42]I never stand on... Ah, I should have hit.
[227:36.02]This is why you can't stand on a 16 versus 10.
[227:38.86]I know this.
[227:39.34]I'm a professional card player.
[227:50.11]Oh my God.
[227:51.05]Why?
[227:51.13]Ace.
[227:51.51]Finally, some fucking wins.
[227:52.79]This guy's not even trying to hide his cheating.
[228:18.95]What do you mean hide?
[228:20.43]Don't do anything to stay.
[228:21.44]He's going to bust.
[228:22.08]And I'm going to make money.
[228:23.50]Don't do anything.
[228:24.62]Told you.
[228:26.38]Yeah, someone's cheating.
[228:28.32]I feel the same way.
[228:30.48]What is this?
[228:42.59]Oh my god.
[228:43.89]I'm gonna lose again.
[228:47.01]Can I go back and get more money from the guy at the cashier?
[228:54.64]Are you having fun?
[228:57.86]Kind of, because this is not real.
[229:00.10]And it's... I guess it'd be kind of... It'd be fun if it's not real.
[229:04.38]And Yanners just came in with a raid of like 75 million people.
[229:09.90]7,200 people just came in from Yanners.
[229:15.47]What's going on, Neanderthals?
[229:16.17]Thanks for the raid.
[229:19.03]Welcome, everybody.
[229:19.69]Currently, I am up about... I have $545 in my bankroll.
[229:26.11]And I'm not a casino streamer, by the way, if anyone's wondering.
[229:29.12]This is just... This is not... We play as a fun Xbox game.
[229:32.58]I came in here with $100.
[229:34.14]I got $545 right now.
[229:36.10]We are doing a big bet, just this hand only.
[229:39.74]Welcome to the stream.
[229:42.12]Hope you had a good stream, Neanderthals.
[229:45.67]I need to raid some.
[229:47.46]Okay.
[229:50.42]I need to be able to hear this.
[230:08.08]Hello?
[230:21.85]I dropped the GoXLR.
[230:23.43]I lifted it up and I smashed it.
[230:31.21]I think it's broke up.
[230:36.31]I think I broke the GoXLR.
[230:42.17]Yeah, it's broken.
[230:48.21]What does that sound like?
[230:49.28]I lifted it up and I dropped it.
[230:56.95]listen to what I did it's supposed to be just going that's not that's not broken that looks fuck whatever anyways I can't do it anymore this is the worst streamer I'm trying to make this work
[231:24.14]Hold on.
[231:25.48]A, B, C, D, motherfucking G. This is broken.
[231:35.52]Yeah, I dropped the GoXLR and I think I may have broke it.
[231:46.08]Hey, that was the raid song.
[231:48.12]Thanks, welcome everybody.
[231:49.68]Everybody left?
[231:50.47]No, don't fucking leave!
[231:58.90]Does my mic sound okay?
[232:05.37]It sounds ecstatic.
[232:07.59]Hold on.
[232:10.29]My mic is messed up?
[232:14.89]What's wrong with it?
[232:19.59]I sound really far away?
[232:21.01]Hello, hello, hello.
[232:29.67]Wait, how about now?
[232:37.04]Okay, anyways, welcome to the stream, everybody.
[232:38.92]Thanks for coming.
[232:44.04]Probably just loosen the wire.
[232:45.43]Well, I can't even click any buttons on my Go Explore.
[232:48.81]It's frozen.
[232:51.43]Yeah, nothing is like, no buttons work.
[232:53.53]I can't turn on the FX or anything, whatever.
[232:57.28]Alright, let's go.
[232:58.47]Sorry, I was going to do a raid song.
[233:02.01]Stand.
[233:04.48]21.
[233:04.58]Fuck this game.
[233:05.34]I should have... Just split.
[233:19.19]You're about to be 5k in debt.
[233:21.75]This is where it turns around.
[233:23.57]Alright, should I just double down?
[233:26.33]Even though it's a 10.
[233:27.17]Who cares?
[233:27.81]Let's go!
[233:29.74]You're knocking it.
[233:30.96]Yo!
[233:32.28]This is very bad.
[233:36.46]Just sing?
[233:37.02]Fine.
[233:44.48]How's that?
[233:47.80]Is that good enough for you?
[233:50.36]No, I didn't want to stand.
[233:51.28]I wanted to hit.
[233:52.06]Fuck.
[233:52.84]I have to go get my money from the guy that gives free money.
[234:01.73]He's going to have blackjack.
[234:04.19]I can't even buy insurance.
[234:05.05]What are you talking about?
[234:18.08]Get me up from the fucking table.
[234:25.53]Once you take three markers, a hitman kills you.
[234:29.79]No you don't!
[234:30.67]That does not happen.
[234:32.33]Ow!
[234:35.14]That does not happen?
[234:36.20]Alright, the person wrote omega lul after that, so I kind of feel like it's real.
[234:42.26]Does somebody kill you?
[234:43.96]You don't get killed, right?
[234:47.34]It can't be real.
[234:53.12]That does not happen.
[234:54.06]Nobody kills you.
[235:05.03]Everyone's having such a good time.
[235:06.15]This is all fake, pumped in cheering.
[235:08.81]You don't understand, casinos probably do that shit.
[235:11.73]They probably pump in fake cheers.
[235:14.05]So half a mile down the casino, you hear that.
[235:17.22]You're like, oh wow, that could be me.
[235:28.73]Get a marker and go spend the money at the bar.
[235:32.41]Alright, these are $1 spins, $25 spins, $250 a spin.
[235:40.81]Go.
[235:45.99]No, this is $100.
[235:46.45]This is $75 spin.
[235:48.47]Come on, let's go.
[235:49.11]Bah, bah, bah.
[235:52.25]Come on, give me a... Bah, bah, bah.
[235:57.78]King of Chicago.
[235:58.72]What does that do?
[236:02.83]handle.
[236:09.83]Bar.
[236:10.23]Bar.
[236:10.65]Bar.
[236:13.80]You don't win on these.
[236:15.96]It's not possible to win on a three slot machine.
[236:23.74]Thanks for almost proving me wrong.
[236:24.90]That would have been great.
[236:25.82]Come on.
[236:26.32]Ba ba ba.
[236:36.02]What happened?
[236:37.74]What just happened?
[236:38.72]What happened?
[236:40.16]What happened?
[236:42.84]What?
[236:43.80]What did I just do?
[236:45.68]Oh my god, I have $7,000.
[236:56.62]I have $7,000.
[236:57.12]Oh my god, it worked.
[237:01.16]Pay back your debt.
[237:02.16]No, what?
[237:02.64]I don't need to.
[237:03.14]I don't have to do that yet.
[237:09.45]Let me pay back my loan.
[237:11.89]Wait, do I have to?
[237:12.87]Look at this walk.
[237:24.60]They're all cheering for me.
[237:28.91]You want to return a marker?
[237:30.09]Yes.
[237:32.45]Return a marker.
[237:33.47]Yes.
[237:34.79]Oh, what?
[237:35.17]I only have 1900 bucks.
[237:35.83]That sucks.
[237:46.87]Alright, we're taking it, we're taking it right, taking the winnings right over to Burger Jim.
[237:57.90]Come on Burger Jim, let's go.
[237:58.88]I paid back all my debt.
[238:02.88]This is all profit right here.
[238:06.73]You play normal games.
[238:07.87]No, I don't.
[238:12.45]Five dollars.
[238:14.81]Load it up.
[238:17.51]Okay.
[238:18.57]Nine lines.
[238:19.89]Let's go for it.
[238:21.07]That max.
[238:24.84]That's something.
[238:26.28]That's something.
[238:31.64]That's big.
[238:34.88]That's big.
[238:35.32]That's huge.
[238:35.82]That's like 25 grand.
[238:39.94]Yeah.
[238:40.16]What?
[238:53.07]What are you talking about?
[238:57.49]Oh, it's $5.
[239:09.00]Catch up.
[239:11.02]Nice.
[239:12.46]Good.
[239:12.98]More.
[239:16.14]Catch up.
[239:19.72]Get out, get out, get out.
[239:20.42]I'm good.
[239:21.06]I got 3,000.
[239:21.42]I'm good.
[239:26.70]Please stop, you've been playing this for more than half an hour.
[239:30.28]I think I told you I was going to be here for like at least two hours before I put the disk in.
[239:39.29]You're telling me to stop playing the casino game in a half an hour.
[239:42.99]You could be new.
[239:44.19]If you are new, just remember, we always come out on top.
[239:47.07]Always.
[239:47.91]Always.
[239:50.43]Last time I had a slot machine in front of me, I went to $20 billion in the chocolate game.
[239:55.03]Time before that, Mr. Green walked away with $2.4 million.
[239:58.97]We always win.
[240:00.09]Always.
[240:00.41]Here's your silver VIP card.
[240:03.78]This allows you to enter $1,000 poker tournaments.
[240:06.16]It makes you eligible to receive the vacation tournament bonus prize.
[240:15.56]What should I do for a tournament?
[240:20.62]Ooh, I love roulette.
[240:28.90]Roulette's great.
[240:30.09]Because it's the slowest game in the casino.
[240:34.33]You could bet $10 and it takes like four minutes, five minutes to have whatever the outcome happens.
[240:38.88]It's very slow.
[240:40.93]The objective of the tournament is to be the player with the highest bankroll after the designated number of games.
[240:45.89]The winner receives $4,000 and the victory counts towards winning a low-level tournament bonus prize.
[240:51.86]Alright.
[240:53.70]Let's go.
[240:54.18]Alright.
[240:54.58]Set bet.
[240:55.82]I want to go... You always do right... You always do the... Right in the middle here.
[241:05.62]You got to get inside the corners.
[241:08.60]We'll put 50 bucks here.
[241:10.90]I'm going to go down here.
[241:13.14]50 bucks down here as well.
[241:14.92]This is it.
[241:15.38]Bingo.
[241:18.34]I'm ready.
[241:20.85]Guys, get the corners.
[241:23.03]I forget what numbers they were.
[241:26.85]In the 20s.
[241:30.51]There it is.
[241:30.83]That's it, right?
[241:33.29]Oh, shit.
[241:33.85]It's okay.
[241:34.49]Okay.
[241:40.06]30 spins.
[241:42.32]I'm keeping the same ones.
[241:44.44]Don't move.
[241:44.96]Another thing in roulette, don't move.
[241:52.05]Precisely why?
[241:53.77]I wasn't, wait.
[241:54.65]Oh, I'm in 22, 23, 24.
[241:55.03]Don't move.
[241:55.35]32, 33, 35, 36, 20.
[241:55.45]We're looking for 30s.
[242:11.87]Don't move.
[242:13.63]Exactly.
[242:14.15]That's why you don't fucking move.
[242:17.72]That's not... Wait, 32?
[242:18.42]Don't move.
[242:18.84]Just don't bet any money.
[242:20.78]Bet $1.
[242:21.82]Wait, could I?
[242:22.98]There it is.
[242:35.73]What the fuck are you talking about?
[242:37.78]What?
[242:39.60]Just don't bet.
[242:43.82]I have to now.
[242:44.92]I'm down $400.
[242:46.74]Don't move.
[242:47.32]It's gonna hit.
[242:48.32]It just has to hit once and I'm up.
[242:56.52]Oh, fuck you.
[243:00.69]I'm not moving.
[243:02.71]The second I take it off, it's gonna hit one of these eight numbers.
[243:07.91]This guy's fucking incompetent.
[243:09.75]It's a game where you spin a marble around and a random person wins.
[243:15.73]There is no skill in roulette.
[243:17.65]It's just throwing a dice in the air.
[243:19.83]What do you mean?
[243:20.63]I know maybe you sit there and rub your belly before each spin, but that doesn't do anything.
[243:36.75]That's the one right here.
[243:38.51]Bingo.
[243:39.17]Fuck.
[243:39.39]Do it!
[243:39.69]28.
[243:39.85]That's it!
[243:40.82]Why?
[244:09.49]You guys start looking people that remember you Look Jeremy at the casino.
[244:22.30]I hope they remember you
[244:39.09]Give me the minus twos.
[244:39.83]I deserve it.
[244:41.11]Oh my god.
[244:41.81]What happens if you have no more money?
[244:43.62]Do I just leave the table?
[244:58.40]Don't move, he says.
[245:00.70]That usually works.
[245:01.49]Look, it hit.
[245:03.05]Whatever.
[245:03.75]I won't do that again.
[245:08.58]Blackjack tournament.
[245:09.20]Let's go.
[245:12.78]Why not just go to a real casino?
[245:14.04]Because this is not real money.
[245:15.42]This is just make-believe.
[245:18.20]You want me to go to a casino and just drop like five grand?
[245:20.99]And just lose?
[245:22.07]Why would I do that?
[245:24.33]Highest bankroll.
[245:32.81]I need to win one hand here and then play one dollar hand.
[245:39.72]Come on.
[245:40.08]I just have to win one hand.
[245:41.57]Alright, that's it.
[245:42.13]Now I'm going to play $1 for the rest of the game.
[245:44.39]$1.
[245:56.95]I don't want 5th to clean that.
[246:00.49]Okay.
[246:00.59]I'm going to win the tournament now.
[246:09.03]This is four grand, by the way.
[246:12.17]Honestly, you know, I gotta try to screw over the person next to me.
[246:17.09]They're looking for... What are they looking for?
[246:19.60]I can play 45 hands.
[246:22.34]So, if I take another card, I could just completely screw Evelynn over.
[246:28.76]Good, that's what you needed.
[246:32.74]Yeah, you lose.
[246:33.38]I win.
[246:37.80]Again.
[246:40.61]Take a look around.
[246:41.69]You go big first.
[246:44.29]I got blackjack with a dollar.
[246:45.97]Whatever.
[246:46.51]I just have to survive.
[246:50.89]Kimberly's coming up here with $1,002.
[246:51.99]I need to bet $2.
[246:59.27]No, I don't.
[246:59.71]Not yet.
[247:04.37]Where were these hands when I was playing 40 minutes ago?
[247:08.42]Why?
[247:08.70]Why?
[247:15.08]Okay.
[247:15.70]I'm still in the lead.
[247:26.36]Oh, no.
[247:26.70]They're cowards.
[247:27.34]They're not going to bet more than... Wait.
[247:29.78]She doubled down over there.
[247:31.10]I hope she loses.
[247:31.73]Okay.
[247:33.09]It's alright.
[247:43.38]What's Kimberly doing with $3?
[247:44.32]Oh my God, what the fuck?
[247:51.34]Yeah, there's a guy in the security window right now like, Mr. Green just currently betting $1 instead of $250 a hand.
[247:58.20]Yeah, just starting to let him win.
[248:01.83]So then he starts, then he gets cocky and puts $100 on the table.
[248:06.17]Assholes.
[248:11.16]$1,015.
[248:11.24]She just spent $5.
[248:13.46]I still think she's going to lose.
[248:25.70]Good.
[248:26.83]I took all the cards from her.
[248:33.11]By the way, the profits are going right to Burger Jim.
[248:35.39]I hope you guys know that.
[248:36.13]Because I'm guaranteed to win this.
[248:43.08]21, shit.
[248:43.58]She's climbing.
[248:45.82]I don't like that.
[248:47.21]Is that 10, 18?
[248:49.63]I think I might... No, I can't.
[248:50.95]I have to just play the statistics that she's not going to bet more.
[248:55.51]She's going $4 now.
[249:02.60]Can I, with like attrition here, can I win this?
[249:04.86]Can I keep doing this?
[249:10.24]I'm good.
[249:12.15]Bet two bucks.
[249:12.87]No!
[249:13.17]No way!
[249:13.51]I have twenty more hands of one dollar.
[249:22.49]Does Jerma read books or just chat?
[249:27.16]Probably just chat at this point.
[249:29.44]Hit again.
[249:30.32]Good.
[249:30.58]Shit.
[249:30.68]Bet five.
[249:31.74]No!
[249:31.80]Why would I bet five?
[249:41.51]I don't have to increase my bet until Kimberly gets up to like 1030, 1040.
[249:46.67]Why would I do that?
[249:55.72]She's going to lose.
[249:56.80]She did $1.
[249:57.44]She's trying to do the same thing.
[249:58.18]She's trying to bait me.
[250:00.30]Okay.
[250:02.38]Alright.
[250:04.92]We're almost halfway there.
[250:11.05]Alright, how- Kimberly, do let- there we go, five bucks.
[250:13.41]Lose it.
[250:15.61]What does she have?
[250:18.49]17 versus five.
[250:21.87]Fuck.
[250:25.26]Uh-oh.
[250:27.50]Slowly, she is closing the gap.
[250:31.22]I had 250 to throw her off.
[250:33.38]No, if I lose, it's over.
[250:40.32]16 versus 5.
[250:41.16]Okay.
[250:43.02]Oh, shit.
[250:43.84]Okay, she has 13.
[250:44.26]This is a hand all of us are going to win.
[250:48.78]Oh, shit.
[250:49.34]Alright.
[250:50.00]What do I do?
[250:50.34]I have to bet 10 bucks.
[250:53.55]What do I do?
[250:54.09]She's climbing.
[250:54.75]No, I don't have to do that yet.
[250:57.27]Stick with the strategy.
[250:57.93]I have to stay with the strategy.
[251:01.35]I'll be fine.
[251:02.47]Okay.
[251:07.40]Sorry.
[251:08.54]I gained a little bit of ground there.
[251:09.90]She lost two, I lost one.
[251:16.94]Bet all your money to throw off her Rhythm.
[251:20.83]Shit.
[251:23.63]Uh-oh.
[251:28.19]I don't have to do it yet.
[251:32.89]Go back to Sneak Gym.
[251:35.63]You're combining two games you've seen today.
[251:37.51]That was a $4 bet.
[251:41.69]Oh, she's in trouble.
[251:43.37]She's going to lose that $4 bet.
[251:47.53]Hey.
[251:49.27]Yes!
[251:49.70]Alright, we're good.
[251:55.98]If you win an all-in, you're going to win the tournament.
[251:58.60]Yeah, but if I just slowly burn $1 a hand and she slowly burns like $2 every other hand, I'm going to win.
[252:05.35]She's gonna lose right here.
[252:06.79]Yeah.
[252:08.27]She's fucked.
[252:10.71]That's a $4 lose.
[252:11.85]Oh, it's alright.
[252:12.37]Whatever.
[252:12.65]Can you please at least try to play as Mr. Green?
[252:20.96]Mr. Green has $100,000 at least on the table.
[252:25.40]I'm not there yet.
[252:26.00]Shit.
[252:27.28]Alright, everybody lost.
[252:28.80]Only like 11 hands.
[252:42.40]This should be a minimum bet.
[252:43.90]Because being able to do $1.
[252:45.58]I just bet $50 the first hand and I'm just going to coast to victory.
[252:52.31]Ah, that sealed it right there, I think.
[253:00.15]Bet $50 now.
[253:00.97]No.
[253:03.29]I don't have to bet $50.
[253:04.63]There's no reason to.
[253:08.67]That's fine.
[253:09.19]Alright, here we go.
[253:09.77]This is a lot to win $4,000.
[253:10.51]Do a $150 hand right now or I'm going to ResidentSleeper.
[253:13.43]Go for it.
[253:14.01]I don't care.
[253:14.87]I'm not losing this tournament.
[253:16.13]I've been here for so long.
[253:34.81]No, I'm about to win $4,000.
[253:36.31]Then I take that to Burger Jim.
[253:40.58]And we're going to do huge bets.
[253:46.96]We're fine.
[253:47.62]Alright, it's sealed.
[253:49.22]As long as she doesn't win another $5 or $10 hand.
[253:51.08]Standing.
[254:00.54]Okay.
[254:05.44]Only six more hands.
[254:06.46]Playing smart is pog.
[254:10.92]Don't listen to them.
[254:12.80]I have blown more fake money on this stream.
[254:15.82]Doing dumb things like that, but it's a guaranteed victory.
[254:19.56]I'm taking the sure thing.
[254:27.03]I feel like Michelle's going to turn to me, take the glasses off, and go like,
[254:31.48]like a big tongue's gonna come out let's split these let's split fives for fun yeah two dollars Michelle's uh getting desperate that was eight bucks

[255:03.66]Stay there.
[255:04.06]Don't do anything.
[255:04.56]Don't fucking... Just get your hands off the table.
[255:07.33]I lost!
[255:07.91]I know you lost, but that's what you do.
[255:09.39]I know you... But you give yourself the best opportunity to fucking win, dude.
[255:13.09]You can't... You gotta try to give yourself an opportunity.
[255:15.31]And with a... With a 13 versus 4, you don't fucking touch anything.
[255:18.51]Don't be an idiot.
[255:26.27]What's that Peter Griffin?
[255:30.08]It's like every one of my relatives how they speak.

[255:59.75]Don't do anything.
[256:00.41]Take your fucking hands off the table.
[256:01.87]See?
[256:03.33]Don't be a fucking idiot about this shit.
[256:04.97]Alright, here we go.
[256:07.95]Final hand after this, right?
[256:09.99]And then I win $4,000 and a bonus prize for my hotel room.
[256:17.94]She's going to bet $50.
[256:19.26]She is not going to bet $50.
[256:20.42]The AI is not that smart.
[256:29.56]Yeah, I win.
[256:31.74]Game over.
[256:32.76]Victory is mine.
[256:33.60]That was Stewie, but whatever.
[256:39.26]Hey, uh, oh no.
[256:40.85]What do I do?
[256:41.59]Oh, I surrender.
[256:42.65]You won the $1,000 blackjack tournament.
[256:54.24]To win the counselor is a bonus prize.
[256:55.54]You must play and win another tournament to win the prize.
[257:01.31]That was for $1,000?
[257:01.67]I thought that was $4,000.
[257:08.55]Wasn't it $4,000?
[257:09.01]Yeah, I'm good.
[257:14.51]I got five grand.
[257:20.40]What's this game?
[257:20.82]Alright.
[257:22.48]I want to go.
[257:22.84]I want to play.
[257:23.38]What do I play now?
[257:25.00]Back to Burger Gym.
[257:31.58]How about back to King of Chicago?
[257:32.90]That was a big win for us.
[257:33.82]Alright, we're going to play King of Chicago.
[257:38.58]Another game?
[257:39.16]Not yet.
[257:39.61]Hold on.
[257:39.97]Just wait.
[257:41.45]I enjoyed this.
[257:46.39]Okay.
[257:48.79]$25 per coin.
[257:50.25]That's... What's 10 coins?
[257:53.50]Okay, this is stupid.
[257:55.38]But it could get us a huge payout.
[258:10.46]Ugh!
[258:12.16]Is it- Wait, this is only- This is 75 bucks.
[258:14.62]This is 75 dollars a spin.
[258:15.90]I'm fine.
[258:16.24]Come on, King of Chicago.
[258:20.12]Let's go.
[258:20.48]I need three guns.
[258:34.53]I'm up- I'm way up.
[258:35.69]I'm fine.
[258:38.33]You gotta do something crazy if you're way up.
[258:40.43]Just a little bit.
[258:41.19]And then, here we go.
[258:42.05]Like, for instance.
[258:44.31]Back to Burger Jim.
[258:44.99]Hold on.
[258:52.66]How did I win?
[258:53.00]Did I just get, like, a sympathy money?
[258:56.56]What was that for?
[259:03.82]Ugh.
[259:08.56]That's gonna be... Alright.
[259:09.42]That's... I can... Okay, I stand alive.
[259:13.81]You're a low IQ slot streamer.
[259:18.67]If you play slots, you're low IQ?
[259:20.63]Shit.
[259:29.30]Hold on.
[259:29.77]Wait.
[259:38.31]Hey, how's that for?
[259:39.11]Nevermind.
[259:47.12]Ah!
[259:50.64]Is that?
[259:51.58]Come on!
[259:53.02]Low IQ slots river.
[259:56.14]What do you mean low IQ?
[259:58.02]It takes that much more IQ to fucking sit at a roulette table?
[260:10.86]Come on.
[260:11.34]Do something.
[260:13.32]Oh my god.
[260:17.13]That would have been insane.
[260:20.75]Let this be a lesson.
[260:21.47]Don't ever go to the casino.
[260:22.63]I'm not going to tell you not to go to the casino, right?
[260:26.29]If you want to go to the casino and just spend some money and hang out with your friends, that's fine.
[260:29.55]But this shit is just, you're going to lose money in the long term, always.
[260:33.21]You're never going to win a substantial amount of money.
[260:35.29]And it doesn't matter how many people they put as a cardboard cutout holding like a fucking $1,100 check.
[260:41.55]Look how much Carol won.
[260:42.95]That's not going to do anything.
[260:44.37]You're not going to win that.
[260:51.66]You're gonna sit here like I am, you're gonna burn through a thousand dollars, and you're not gonna be the person with the check in their hand.
[260:59.63]It's a lesson.
[261:11.12]But my grandmother won.
[261:16.85]I'm a net positive from casinos.
[261:20.11]That's really good.
[261:22.02]Try to keep it that way.
[261:22.82]I just need another big hit so I can go back to Burger Jim.
[261:36.51]2k, not 1k.
[261:38.53]And you fixed it.
[261:40.95]My point still stands.
[261:43.22]Keep it that way.
[261:43.68]Don't ever go back.
[261:47.46]Come on.
[261:48.50]This is $2,000 in King of the Casino or whatever the game is called.
[261:55.89]Come on.
[261:56.45]Do it.
[261:56.77]You've lost $3,000.
[262:03.11]Have you not realized that?
[262:16.45]This is it.
[262:16.81]That's it.
[262:17.09]That's it.
[262:17.41]We're going to get it right here.
[262:18.95]No more.
[262:19.23]We're going to go to Burger Gym after this.
[262:20.71]Look at that.
[262:21.09]Bingo.
[262:21.71]Oh, come on.
[262:25.67]What did you want me to do?
[262:27.09]I'm in another casino video game right now.
[262:30.35]Am I not supposed to play the casino games in the casino Xbox game?
[262:35.99]I can't take this out of here and go somewhere with this.
[262:52.24]Died to king of Chicago.
[262:54.00]We're going to get a hit right here.
[263:01.06]Oh, come on.
[263:05.62]Come on, please.
[263:11.68]I feel good when I see big number on your screen.
[263:16.02]Is that the opportunity for me to leave?
[263:16.96]Get out.
[263:22.76]Get out.
[263:23.12]Get out.
[263:23.60]Get out.
[263:24.02]Fuck that game.

[263:46.95]What do we got?
[263:58.78]How does Keno even work?

[268:07.20]That sounds terrible.
[268:08.14]Alright, we're going to do 35 because that's how old I am.

[271:01.08]Alright, let's do $25 in the ante.
[271:09.70]Let's go ahead.
[271:11.26]Gotta make the best hand you can with three cards.
[271:15.86]Looking for a flush.
[271:19.27]I'm gonna bet on this one.
[271:23.39]There it is.
[271:23.85]Alright.
[271:24.53]Not bad.

[271:27.33]You guys don't understand how this works.
[271:29.67]I have king, so I get the high card.
[271:31.73]I win.
[271:32.11]Everyone plays against the dealer.
[271:33.58]I hate this game, but I'm gonna play it.
[271:37.30]If I put money on pair plus, by the way, if I put money on pair plus, if I get a pair or above that,
[271:47.17]I make a little bit of money.
[271:48.65]A lot of money, actually.
[271:49.47]Let's go for a big one.
[271:50.15]Give me a pair.
[271:59.36]It's not a pair.
[272:02.50]I'm out.
[272:03.32]I have to fold.
[272:03.90]Because this hand sucks.
[272:09.96]And I would have lost.
[272:15.81]You're a moron.
[272:17.32]He's playing Pair Plus Omega LOL.
[272:20.02]I know, it's a sucker bet, but whatever.

[272:34.17]Three cards suck.
[272:39.97]Go all in.
[272:41.19]I just gotta get one decent Pair Plus hand.
[272:46.14]It's not a pair plus.
[272:49.15]But I'm gonna play because I have a king.
[272:51.57]And it's just a high card.
[272:53.17]Yep.
[272:59.37]This time we're gonna go even higher.
[273:00.35]What do you think?
[273:02.04]Alright, I'm looking for a big pair plus.
[273:04.48]Wow, that's bad.
[273:06.06]Stupid idea.
[273:08.70]I'll do 70 bucks.
[273:11.82]Let's go.
[273:12.24]Pairs.
[273:13.54]Give me a pair.
[273:13.94]Pairs.
[273:21.34]I have to.
[273:21.92]I have to.
[273:22.42]Yeah, I'm just going to stay in.
[273:25.08]Alright.
[273:26.28]I'm alright.
[273:26.68]I only lost $45.
[273:27.66]Get more Omega Low.
[273:30.30]This is all I got.
[273:31.04]I'm not going back to the stupid cashier.
[273:32.94]Hair.
[273:36.92]What I lost?
[273:50.95]When I said be funny, ban that person for life.
[273:53.95]Permanently.
[273:56.11]Damn it!
[274:06.94]I would've- that would've been a flush!
[274:09.58]Alright, just- it's a queen.
[274:12.73]I- I'm only leasing f- whatever.
[274:19.37]Give me something better than a pear!
[274:22.44]Give me something better than this so I can prove to everybody here that this is like not a sucker's bet every single time.
[274:29.38]See, why don't you get the pears?
[274:38.70]For a second I thought that said I was broke.
[274:40.94]But that person's name is Brooke.
[274:43.16]Old again.
[274:46.28]Pear Plus, low IQ.
[274:47.74]That's fine, but somebody's going to come over to this table.
[274:51.44]They're going to put $100 on Pear Plus, and they're going to win $15,000.
[274:56.12]Like me.
[274:57.12]Like me.
[274:58.20]Like me right now.
[274:59.44]Like me.
[275:00.32]Like me.
[275:01.17]Like this guy right here.
[275:02.81]Like me.
[275:04.29]I just won $120.
[275:04.89]That's nothing.
[275:07.35]That's a sucker's bet.
[275:18.93]Oh, that was bad.
[275:24.14]It is a sucker's bet.
[275:27.00]Huh.
[275:30.34]Oh, yeah?
[275:33.76]I'll show you a sucker.
[275:39.65]How's that for a fucking sucker bet?
[275:45.58]Oh, I thought it was going to be a straight.
[275:47.36]I thought it was going to be a straight.
[275:49.24]Do it again.
[275:56.69]Come on.
[275:57.07]And then I'm going to leave.
[275:58.29]I'm going to play a different game.
[276:02.99]Oh, my God.
[276:03.63]Sorry.
[276:32.34]My brain's turning into soup.
[276:37.56]Well, go get some crackers.
[276:44.20]Did I exit the game?
[276:45.06]What just happened?
[276:45.48]I was trying to exit the table.
[277:01.61]Why do I have a thousand dollars?
[277:14.52]Oh, I didn't save the game in like an hour and a half.
[277:24.96]Oops.
[277:28.27]Oh, we got that big, hey, remember we got that big hit from, uh, Chicago Royale, whatever it is.
[277:35.45]No, value.
[277:49.76]Okay, I'm just gonna play like five dollar hands and then go into the pair plus and put as much as I can.
[278:11.66]Play this all night.
[278:12.34]I don't think I want to.
[278:13.34]I don't want to play this all night.
[278:14.81]This game is not as fun as like Vegas Stakes was.
[278:20.01]It's not a pair plus.
[278:31.79]I'm going to throw up because of this.
[278:33.03]Why did I not play that hand?
[278:35.65]I would have won at least $5 back.
[278:37.21]Does it really matter if I want to win $5 back at this point?
[278:39.95]Not really.
[278:49.49]I'm getting a new game we're gonna play into the game here it's been two hours yeah I had fun it's been fun you had a flush what
[279:19.06]Wait, I actually had a flush?
[279:22.18]Wait.
[279:23.12]That would have been probably like $3,000 or $4,000 at least.
[279:25.24]That probably would have been like $10,000.
[279:27.60]Really?
[279:27.88]I had the flush?
[279:40.03]I wasn't even paying attention.
[279:44.86]You streamed this for two hours.
[279:46.08]I don't think it was that long.
[280:01.69]It was not that long.
[280:02.77]It was not.
[280:09.18]Burger Jim is back.
[280:09.92]This is exhausting.
[280:13.08]We're not doing sit-ups.
[280:15.75]I'm just playing in the casino game.
[280:39.24]Oh, there it is!
[280:39.84]There it is!
[280:51.91]Burger Jim for three hours.
[280:53.43]No, I'm done after this.
[280:56.43]Alright, that's it.
[280:56.91]This is the last spin and then that's it.
[281:00.53]And then one more after that.
[281:07.93]Alright, next game.
[281:11.71]God damn it.
[281:12.15]Alright, I'm going to pee.
[281:18.72]I'll come back.
[281:19.14]We'll play another game.
[281:21.32]Xbox Night Continues.
[281:23.94]We're back.
[283:34.11]Okay, this is another game that I'm not sure how good this is going to be, but I saw the, I kind of just saw the title, and I had to try it, I had to play it, I had to buy it.
[283:48.71]And that game, what I'm referring to, obviously, is Dinotopia, the Sunstone Odyssey for Xbox.
[284:03.88]Oh.
[284:05.92]I wonder.
[284:09.54]Let's see how this is.
[284:12.10]Dinotopia.
[284:14.48]It looks a little broken in the middle there, but that's okay.
[284:17.92]Apprentice.
[284:19.65]Master.
[284:20.13]Apprentice.
[284:21.49]Dino doi doi doi.
[284:31.95]I had a VHS of this show.
[284:33.41]Wait, this is a TV show?
[284:47.39]Hold on.
[284:47.89]Wait a second.
[284:48.94]Did that just go... Ah!
[284:53.12]Billy West?
[285:13.09]That T-Rex, I swear to God, that was like... I need to hear a clip of that.
[285:17.97]I'm not in control of the character.
[285:26.92]What was the point of showing that?
[285:28.24]They could have just said, get up, we gotta go.
[285:29.62]Why did they show that?
[285:34.68]Here it is.
[285:39.16]Let's go inside.
[285:42.04]Follow your brother, Jacob.
[285:45.28]Move in the direction you wish to go.
[285:46.83]Press B to jump.
[285:51.73]Okay, do I have attacks?
[285:57.06]Ah, the Gemini twins.
[285:59.38]I've been expecting you.
[286:01.26]Drake, this is Custer Pollux.
[286:04.08]He was a friend of Dad's.
[286:05.50]He taught me how to fight, and I brought you here so he can teach you, too.
[286:09.40]Oh, the stick?
[286:10.38]It's good to meet you, Mr. Pollux.
[286:12.29]I was so sad to hear about your father.
[286:15.65]Jonas was a good friend of mine.
[286:17.59]Shrek.
[286:18.23]Thanks for your concern, Mr. Polly.
[286:19.85]This stupid island's been nothing but trouble since we were standing here many years ago.
[286:23.76]How am I going to find a T-Rex with a broomstick?
[286:25.48]It doesn't seem very good.
[286:27.50]Dad gets crippled in the wreck.
[286:29.54]And then, just because some blind dinosaur lets him ride around on her.
[286:35.28]Everything's happening so fast, yeah.
[286:53.23]This looks like a typewriter that has fucked up teeth, whatever they're called.
[286:57.52]What is he saying?
[286:58.60]A dinosaur is gonna be tried for murder?
[287:22.86]You made animals defend dinotopia not to destroy it whatever
[287:29.38]Oi, I'll do it.
[287:30.54]Oi, I'll do it.
[287:31.70]Oi, you won't.
[287:33.36]I've agreed to train you because you've just faced a very traumatic event in your lives.
[287:38.32]And you're more likely to do something reckless that could get you hurt.
[287:42.98]Dinosaurs committed murder.
[287:44.88]I hope they talk.
[287:46.10]God, I hope they talk.
[287:48.28]This is why I ask you.
[287:50.32]Please be cautious with the skills that I teach.
[287:53.24]I've already gone over most of this with Jacob.
[287:56.34]So, let's get started.
[287:59.59]Jacob and Drake.
[288:00.59]Drake and Jacob.
[288:02.87]I am also giving you a sunstone counterweight to place on the other end of your staff.
[288:09.45]This particular mallet head is not very strong, but it will do for now.
[288:15.51]There are three sages who live throughout Dinotopia who are former guardians of the island.
[288:20.83]They are far too old now to defend much of anything.
[288:25.33]If you ever meet any of them, I'm sure with some persuasion they'd give you other mallet heads.
[288:31.84]You may find other smaller sunstones.
[288:33.76]Drake, Amphrys, and Jacob.
[288:35.44]Yeah, that's right.
[288:36.00]Sunstones, when placed into a mallet, will make it more powerful.
[288:41.71]Each collected sunstone will add to a pool of energy displayed in the upper left corner with the blue bar.
[288:47.06]This sunstone energy can be used for sunstone powers when you receive them.
[288:51.70]It is important that you are always aware of threats around you.
[288:58.10]Move in the direction you want to orient the camera.
[289:00.54]Press to reorient camera.
[289:02.61]What is that?
[289:03.83]A chocolate chip.
[289:04.65]What is that?
[289:06.09]Let us go over a few basic attacks.
[289:08.59]Approach the training dummy and attack it.
[289:12.75]What's with that neck?
[289:16.98]Super nerd neck.
[289:25.23]That's it?
[289:28.18]Can't wait to beat the dinosaurs with this move.
[289:42.65]Okay, interact.
[289:43.71]Hey, thanks for teaching me.
[289:44.97]You didn't teach me anything.
[289:46.09]If you target an enemy before you attack, you can focus your movements on that enemy.
[289:50.83]He made a training dummy and just said, hey, just do whatever you want.
[289:53.51]Just swing at it, I guess.
[289:58.29]You're not teaching me anything.
[290:01.54]Hold to select closest next target.
[290:06.82]Hold to untarget.
[290:11.14]Return.
[290:11.76]Wait, hold on.
[290:13.44]You touch it, and it targets.
[290:15.69]Hold to un- Okay, you tap it to go to another target.
[290:18.85]Hold to untarget.
[290:21.09]Okay, I got it.
[290:23.61]Hold down.
[290:24.33]Target a dummy and throw a Hobie Pepper.
[290:32.11]What?
[290:32.31]He didn't even teach me that.
[290:34.89]I'm learning on my own.
[290:43.81]Be careful when you use hobie peppers.
[290:46.65]Usually they'll blind an opponent.
[290:49.21]Though sometimes all they'll do is make them angry.
[290:52.71]The Dinotopia miniseries is free and legal to watch on YouTube right now.
[290:56.33]I do not believe that.
[290:58.09]Just because something is free does not mean I have the rights to broadcast it.
[291:02.08]Two things can happen.
[291:03.70]Your attacks will grow stronger or you'll receive instructions for other attacks from messenger birds I send out.
[291:15.03]Alright, let's go.
[291:16.79]That's Robert Atkinson.
[291:26.14]I think it is.
[291:26.54]It is.
[291:26.94]It is.
[291:27.24]It is.
[291:27.62]It is.
[291:27.74]Is it?
[291:27.90]That's him.
[291:28.24]That's him.
[291:28.54]That's him.
[291:28.76]That's him.
[291:50.45]I think that actually is him.
[291:51.89]Come on, is it?
[291:52.35]Let's see.
[291:52.85]I think it's him.
[292:06.65]Video games.
[292:06.95]Is it him?
[292:07.25]When did this come out?
[292:07.95]Dinotopia.
[292:08.39]When did this come out?
[292:09.17]What?
[292:26.26]I need to find that.
[292:28.41]This is him.
[292:28.83]Dinotopia?
[292:29.17]It's so bollock.
[292:30.11]Dinotopia, where is it?
[292:32.17]What the fuck?
[292:33.07]It's not him.
[292:33.89]Shit.
[292:55.26]Pastor Pollux has lost his marbles.
[292:56.80]Help him find them.
[292:57.58]What?
[293:00.10]What the hell?
[293:00.88]You did that?
[293:01.44]Okay, what the hell do I have to do?
[293:17.46]I forget.
[293:17.86]What am I doing?
[293:18.48]Kill the bird?
[293:33.75]I promise.
[293:40.11]He lost his marbles, like in his house?
[293:52.12]Find Ms.
[293:52.90]Oxbridge at the town center.
[293:54.98]Find the glass rocks.
[294:02.46]What?
[294:06.50]Okay.
[294:08.12]Wait.
[294:08.44]While targeted, pull to dodge in a direction.
[294:11.46]Hold X to block.
[294:12.76]What is this?
[294:13.30]Why is there a dinosaur in his house?
[294:15.02]This is actually kind of cool.
[294:29.20]I like this.
[294:31.60]I get experience for that?
[294:34.28]This game's kind of fun.
[294:35.02]I like it.
[294:36.12]I can't wait to fight a T-Rex.
[294:36.88]Stop hurting him.
[294:49.03]Is this his pet or something?
[294:49.91]I have no idea where I'm supposed to go.
[295:00.21]I'm just going to go back down.
[295:01.21]Go to the town center.
[295:02.03]This looks like, um, what looks like this?
[295:04.02]Darnassus.
[295:07.90]That was Mr. Bollocks' dog.
[295:09.26]Alright, I'm going to leave.
[295:17.34]Just go to the town center.
[295:25.42]We have not completed all quests on this level.
[295:30.29]What the fuck are you talking about?
[295:31.99]What?
[295:43.81]Where's this guy's marbles?
[295:50.28]Find his marbles.
[296:01.51]Is there a sprint?
[296:05.59]Are they in a chest or something?
[296:06.73]You can leave without doing the quests.
[296:12.14]Can I?
[296:12.56]Holy shit, that was a huge jump.
[296:23.61]I know it's a figure of speech, but why would it want me to stay here?
[296:35.77]Nobody played this game.
[296:36.69]Nobody knows.
[296:37.59]Okay.
[296:50.39]Now what?
[296:50.83]Find this Oxbridge.
[297:00.31]Are these bad guys?
[297:01.01]Wait, are these bad?
[297:02.21]Can dinosaurs talk?
[297:04.37]The harvest was good this year.
[297:07.10]What?
[297:10.70]The T-Rex... That T-Rex did go.
[297:20.71]I knew something was weird about the way he roared.
[297:27.52]This is so weird.
[297:28.40]I have to collect all the apples.
[297:30.46]Okay.
[297:30.86]I see one right here.
[297:57.82]That wasn't his dog.
[297:58.70]Was that his... Was that his, like, friend?
[298:01.74]Or his, like, significant other or something?
[298:04.72]I don't know.
[298:05.32]I don't know if they can talk.
[298:14.82]What is this neighbor?
[298:17.52]What is this little kid here?
[298:22.78]He can't talk to the kid?
[298:23.48]Why does he look so strange?
[298:35.37]Where'd he go?
[298:39.95]Oh, there he is.
[298:42.97]Skip.
[298:46.67]Dinotopia.
[298:47.83]Oh, hold on.
[298:48.33]What do you have?
[298:52.11]Haven't found all my apples yet?
[298:54.05]I'm working on it.
[299:00.67]Breathe deep, young Drake Gemini.
[299:04.03]Seek peace.
[299:05.11]Are you Ms.
[299:05.65]Oxbridge?
[299:06.87]Why, yes.
[299:07.67]I will get the apples, I promise.
[299:08.79]My friend, Caster Pollock, sent word that he has trained you in the use of a weapon.
[299:13.60]You must be cautious with a weapon.
[299:16.18]After all, the code of Dinotopia states that weapons are enemies, even to their owner.
[299:22.34]That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
[299:23.38]If you are to use this weapon responsibly, you must wield it as a guardian of Dinotopia.
[299:29.58]You should only use it to help those in need.
[299:33.02]and never in a hateful manner.
[299:35.28]Tell me, why do you seek to be a guardian of Dinotopia?
[299:41.95]Well, it's not like I'm really seeking it out.
[299:45.32]My father deeply loved Dinotopia.
[299:48.36]Before he passed on, he made my brother and me promise to defend Dinotopia.
[299:53.30]It's like a mallet.
[299:55.80]It's a broomstick with a fucking shoehorn on the end.
[300:01.56]The only thing I've ever really cared about is my family.
[300:04.72]Now all I've got left of it is the promise that I made to my father.
[300:10.17]Perhaps in time you may realize that your family can extend beyond your relatives.
[300:16.81]One thing is for sure, young Drake.
[300:19.67]You are not alone.
[300:21.84]If you will face the perils of Dinotopia's defense, you will need to become stronger.
[300:27.92]One thing you must understand is that the entirety of one's strength comes from a balance of one's mind, body, and spirit.
[300:38.56]You want the lore?
[300:39.44]Really?
[300:39.62]Something about the way that their brains would squish.
[300:42.59]And their skull and brain matter would explode if you did it for me.
[301:01.91]If you can figure out how to get to this strongbox and then return to me with the artifact, I will reward you with the mallet head.
[301:12.06]Okay.
[301:14.64]Oh, it's a jumping quest.
[301:18.70]Where is that?
[301:19.90]Over here?
[301:20.18]I gotta get the apples for that guy, too.
[301:26.35]Can't do it.
[301:26.71]Don't worry.
[301:34.03]Masha Dino's brain.
[301:37.35]Oh, is it back here?
[301:38.03]Oh, shit.
[301:43.77]It's another dinosaur.
[301:44.57]Does it want to talk too?
[301:52.24]What?
[302:00.54]Was I just imagining him talking?
[302:04.40]Well, I'm really going crazy.
[302:13.89]Apples, alright, three four.
[302:14.99]You didn't talk dude, what are you talking about?
[302:19.91]I'm the crazy one?
[302:22.77]Where's this thing to jump to?
[302:23.87]This game's amazing.
[302:36.48]I'm here for a while.
[302:37.42]I'm not giving up on this.
[302:48.04]Where is this thing to do?
[302:53.84]Game's incredible.
[302:54.60]Alright, I'm going to play it.
[302:58.42]Oh, it's up there.
[302:59.28]Okay, it's up.
[303:00.06]How do I get up there?
[303:08.48]Help me.
[303:08.72]How do I get up there?
[303:09.22]How do I get up there?
[303:15.48]Can I go up even higher?
[303:20.19]Choose your destination.
[303:25.07]Uh, treetop manor?
[303:39.57]A completely different area.
[303:48.41]It is, but I don't think I could go anywhere in the last area.
[303:50.74]Why can't they talk?
[303:57.16]Is this it?
[304:09.09]Because it looked like it was down.
[304:10.13]I mean, it was up from where I was.
[304:11.41]I have no idea.
[304:24.22]This way?
[304:27.62]It was a prompt and you missed the area?
[304:35.81]Go back to the other... Go back to the other woman.
[304:40.11]Oh, come on, really?
[304:52.86]I just go back to that other area?
[305:00.47]Is it in that just same zone?
[305:09.30]I mean, I'll be honest.
[305:10.10]Every single thing looks identical.
[305:18.04]There's no map.
[305:18.98]I have no idea where I am.
[305:28.32]I don't even know what that place was called.
[305:29.84]Town Center?
[305:30.38]Yeah, like right over here.
[305:50.63]Oh, what the fuck is that?
[305:55.26]Oh my god.
[305:55.86]Alright, here it is.
[305:56.34]So I have to jump to that.
[306:00.62]How am I supposed to jump to that?
[306:01.52]That's really difficult to do.
[306:09.10]This sucks.
[306:09.80]Alright, break these.
[306:21.05]Oh.
[306:23.25]I'm really glad I did that because that would have taken me a very long time.
[306:25.82]I just fell off the edge.
[306:27.82]I'm fine.
[306:28.28]I'm good.
[306:35.00]Give me the weapon.
[306:35.64]Okay.
[306:39.18]Return the statue.
[306:40.05]And I need one more thing of apples.
[306:43.25]I would like this.
[306:51.04]apples good job young drake you have proven to me that you are worthy of receiving this stone in 30 minutes I am not stopping until I fight at least five dinosaurs which mallet heads um everybody get down I thought it was a pterodactyl
[307:21.88]But all animals talk in this world, right?
[307:29.77]Oh, my.
[307:30.97]You'd better get to the hatchery.
[307:32.83]Hopefully the matriarch is alright.
[307:35.23]Remember, Drake, only use that weapon as guardian of Dinotopia would to help those in danger of being harmed and never, ever out of hatred.
[307:48.35]What would the difference be if I were to punch someone in the face right now out of hatred?
[307:53.92]Does that change things?
[307:55.74]Like, if I were to punch you in the face right now because I hate you, does that make it different because I didn't use a weapon?
[308:07.03]Travel between areas of the forest outpost using gondolas like the one you arrived in.
[308:11.61]Go to the hatchery.
[308:12.45]Alright, I need apples.
[308:21.17]Is this moral points?
[308:24.63]Is it really?
[308:25.07]Alright, I need this other guy's apples.
[308:28.73]Where are they?
[308:38.98]Where's the final bushel of apples?
[308:45.56]This is actually a good and evil system.
[308:48.58]That's pretty funny actually.
[308:52.48]Where are these fucking apples?
[309:04.72]This is a book TV show tie-in game.
[309:14.05]Go back up.
[309:25.37]Alright.
[309:26.35]I don't think there's another bushel of apples on this floor.
[309:30.57]This is not.
[309:36.26]Where the hell are they?
[309:44.64]It's right there.
[309:51.31]It's not right here.
[309:58.65]Alright, what do I get for doing this?
[310:12.38]Great!
[310:13.22]You've got them!
[310:14.30]Wonderful!
[310:15.66]Here are your hobie peppers.
[310:17.34]Now, I can get these peeled and into the pies!
[310:21.87]Alright, so I got hobie peppers.
[310:23.23]Now let's go to the hatchery and rescue the dinos in trouble.
[310:29.26]I don't know.
[310:29.88]Is that what I'm supposed to do?
[310:40.48]You're not wearing any pants.
[310:41.65]I think, I believe I'm wearing pants.
[310:45.73]What is that exit?
[310:53.19]Fuck.
[310:53.61]Close the... Get down!
[310:55.37]Where's the... How do I get out of here?
[310:56.53]Okay, here we go.
[311:11.93]Hatchery exit.
[311:14.41]The hatchery's under attack.
[311:26.55]Doesn't look like anybody's really that concerned about whatever's happening.
[311:32.57]I'm not seeing any very much panic.
[311:41.80]Have you done Fable 2 yet?
[311:43.26]I have not done Fable 2.
[311:45.89]I've beaten that game like three times, but not on stream.
[311:53.82]Next game.
[311:54.30]Well, I mean, it depends.
[311:57.54]It depends if this continues to be a snooze fest.
[311:59.87]I'm going to move on.
[312:09.06]Okay, let's go.
[312:13.58]I want to see at least a dinosaur or two.
[312:23.39]Fable 2 would be awesome.
[312:24.47]That's, you know what, that's a really good idea.
[312:29.12]Get Fable 2 on the list.
[312:30.30]I will play through Fable 2.
[312:36.71]Defend the hatchery.
[312:46.50]Got so many games on the list already.
[312:57.70]Alright, come on.
[312:59.94]Let's go.
[313:00.38]I feel like this is empty.
[313:02.82]Am I in the dev game?
[313:05.82]The dev kit?
[313:06.64]Whatever it is.
[313:07.26]Why is there nothing here?
[313:08.20]Fable sucks?
[313:20.29]Fable 3 sucks.
[313:22.49]Right?
[313:23.11]From what I remember.
[313:27.22]Wait, who am I fighting here?
[313:33.87]Who's the bad guy?
[313:38.27]In this scenario, am I... am I fighting the humans?
[313:51.55]This dinosaur is the... is the one getting attacked.
[314:03.05]This really is just like dumpy fable with dinosaurs.
[314:07.00]But not even fable.
[314:07.88]This is way worse than fable.
[314:12.72]Thank you for helping me.
[314:14.78]If you had gotten here any later, I wouldn't have died.
[314:17.61]This is so boring.
[314:18.25]Sorry.
[314:18.45]The outsiders have raided the area and are trying to find the matriarch.
[314:22.27]But there's so much potential.
[314:23.65]She needs to be protected.
[314:28.48]Get away.
[314:33.82]There's so much potential here.
[314:35.52]Look it.
[314:36.00]It's so... It's right here in front of us.
[314:38.88]We can taste it.
[314:44.23]What's wrong with Fable 3?
[314:46.23]Um, Fable 3 you like open chests to make decisions.
[314:49.75]It's stupid.
[314:51.15]You go to like the... the weird world where you like have to make decisions by using a currency.
[314:55.82]It was... I hated that.
[314:57.24]It was stupid.
[315:03.12]Unlock, like, the next, like, thing to try.
[315:04.82]The next decision to make with, like, a fucking chest currency thing.
[315:07.89]That game is dumb.
[315:08.53]It was this dumb currency thing.
[315:09.53]I hated it.
[315:09.85]Make sure you get, like, followers to open the chests.
[315:15.13]No.
[315:15.41]I want to just, like, decide if I'm going to execute the guy or not.
[315:18.63]Give me that decision.
[315:19.83]I just want to make that decision.
[315:22.89]Do I steal the bread or do I not steal the bread?
[315:24.63]Make it simple for me.
[315:38.46]Your memory is terrible.
[315:39.53]I don't think it is.
[315:40.23]Then Fable... Hello there, laddie.
[315:45.09]Where are you off to?
[315:46.65]Protecting the hatchery, is it?
[315:48.35]I thought that was Jar Jar Binks.
[315:50.13]Very impressive for one so young.
[315:52.69]If it isn't too much trouble, would you be willing to help out an old dirt scratcher like me?
[315:57.56]Seems the disease has hit my crops hard.
[316:00.34]I know of a cure, but it requires dim root to complete.
[316:03.64]And I don't feel it's safe out there to go poking around.
[316:07.34]If you bring me three of these bright blue plants, I'll give you some information about a sunstone I know.
[316:13.52]I don't want to play anymore.
[316:14.26]I'm done.
[316:18.61]I'm done.
[316:19.03]Next game.
[316:19.75]Next one.
[316:20.23]I don't want to play this one anymore.
[316:21.37]Wait, is this guy hostile?
[316:42.83]It's a caveman.
[316:43.75]Yeah, I guess.
[316:44.43]That dinosaur looks like my school superintendent.
[316:57.34]Huh?
[317:01.88]What are you talking about?
[317:03.68]What are you even talking about?
[317:04.96]This makes me just want to play Fable 2.
[317:14.72]Yeah, should I... Should I start Fable 2?
[317:18.11]Should I play Fable 2 next week?
[317:24.63]Just like beat it?
[317:25.29]Like play through it over the weekend?
[317:31.59]But hold on though.
[317:32.81]Is Fable... Is my brain remembering?
[317:35.93]Is that game actually good and fun and interesting and shit?
[317:38.95]Like I don't remember.
[317:39.81]I think it is, right?
[317:55.42]Don't you have a game called Dinotopia and you just fight defias bandits with shields?
[318:03.88]Why did that guy fall down?
[318:15.31]Do I have superpowers?
[318:17.81]You said you beat Fable 2 like three times.
[318:20.49]I did.
[318:20.79]Like ten years ago.
[318:22.49]I don't remember anything about the game.
[318:25.11]All I remember is this one specific line.
[318:27.90]You'll be as normal as the sound of your own heartbeat.
[318:32.06]I don't know what the context is.
[318:33.38]I don't know where the character is.
[318:35.00]I just remember that line.
[318:36.18]I don't know what that means, but I know it's in the game.
[318:43.60]Play Fable 3.
[318:46.39]Whoa.
[318:54.23]That's cool.
[319:00.20]Play Gothic.
[319:00.88]I have Gothic 3.
[319:02.34]I think I have all the Gothic games installed right now.
[319:06.44]I keep adding shit to lists and then I never play them.
[319:15.42]I have so many games that you're just gonna see trickled in over like months and years of time.
[319:20.52]Sometimes I forget I even bought them or installed them.
[319:23.34]And then it takes somebody to remind me like, oh hey dude, play Gothic.
[319:26.58]And I'm like, oh yeah, I have fucking every Gothic installed right now.
[319:29.46]I have all of them.
[319:31.45]Alright, I forgot I was going to play that.
[319:43.29]Three is shit.
[319:43.89]Yeah, I would play two before I play three.
[319:45.38]Can I talk to the dinosaurs?
[319:50.18]I can't talk to the dinosaurs.
[319:57.67]Please, God, do not play Sneak King.
[320:00.71]I already did, and everybody hated it.
[320:01.76]Yeah, I did too.
[320:06.16]Oh, I need to play NBA Street as well.
[320:08.72]Oh, NBA Street.
[320:10.89]One of my favorite games on Xbox 360 and Xbox.
[320:18.23]Oh, fuck.
[320:18.81]I need to play that.
[320:27.24]NBA Street is probably the best game ever made.
[320:33.44]That's a sports game.
[320:34.20]Let's make that clear.
[320:35.79]And the NBA Street franchise was the best sports franchise.
[320:39.57]That and Slugfest.
[320:40.49]And they just decided to stop making them.
[320:41.95]Because for some stupid ass reason, every video game company decided that simulations and realistic take-me-seriously video games were what everybody apparently cared about and nobody does.
[320:55.36]Where are the crazy fucking slugfest games?
[320:58.12]Where's... Where's NFL Blitz?
[321:00.68]Why do... I don't want to play Madden.
[321:02.40]I want to play Blitz.
[321:03.82]I don't want to play MLB The Show.
[321:06.19]I want to play Slugfest.
[321:07.57]I don't want to fucking play NBA 2K.
[321:09.87]I want to play NBA Street.
[321:12.19]Why did they stop making these games?
[321:16.57]They stopped making them.
[321:18.94]We have, like, a full two generations of consoles of new technology and new engines that would be so much fun with these games.
[321:28.71]How would you stop making NFL Blitz?
[321:36.03]Dude, NBA Street.
[321:37.47]It's not like, oh, they wouldn't be popular.
[321:39.02]They're not popular.
[321:39.70]They weren't that popular.
[321:40.52]You're misremembering things.
[321:42.08]NBA Street was so popular.
[321:44.97]It was one of the most fun arcade games ever.
[321:48.93]It was so good.
[321:49.71]I don't understand why not make another one.
[321:56.17]And they've done NBA Jam.
[321:58.61]Yeah, remember when we ported that to fucking iPhones?
[322:01.82]No, no, no.
[322:02.42]Give me another one.
[322:03.10]Give me a new one that you didn't just make it in Flash.
[322:08.74]Hey guys, remember NBA Jam?
[322:10.00]Oh, you're gonna love this one.
[322:11.66]The only difference is we made it in Flash this time.
[322:15.08]I- Oh, you know what?
[322:16.41]I don't- Like, come on.
[322:17.47]Give me a real one.
[322:28.24]Hey, stop hogging the Xbox.
[322:29.32]Your brother wants to play Halo.
[322:31.42]Fuck Halo.
[322:34.27]the matriarch is ill just look at her you have to find the antidote drake relax just the outsider with the spear has the antidote in a diamond shaped vial it's blue get it and bring it back quickly to our beloved matriarch I have no idea what's happening in this world oh what are the matriarch
[322:58.06]What?
[322:59.66]Did we miss a very important piece of history in this world?
[323:05.66]Yeah, and why is it?
[323:21.38]Don't even get me going on this bullshit.
[323:24.96]Everyone wanted to take the game so seriously.
[323:28.58]No, no, no.
[323:28.90]We can't have anything like funny or fun or interesting or like not realistic in our like wrestling game.
[323:34.41]It's got to be a fucking guy with underwear on simulation where you like simulate wrestling and it's real.
[323:40.45]No, no, no.
[323:43.03]You have to go for a first down.
[323:45.43]Touchdown.
[323:46.20]Got it.
[323:46.66]Real.
[323:47.02]This is a real simulation.
[323:51.22]Give me the fucked up shit again.
[323:53.04]It was stuff was so fucked up.
[323:54.62]You could just do whatever you wanted.
[323:55.80]It was so much more fun.
[323:58.22]I don't want to pretend I'm playing a game of football.
[324:00.50]I want to dropkick somebody in the head while they're running for a touchdown, and then I want them to, like, just roundhouse kick me in the stomach, and have a fumble happen, and then we both have to fistfight to get the ball.
[324:12.59]That's fucking fun.
[324:14.43]I don't want to sit there and play a fake pretend game of football.
[324:20.10]And everyone's saying Blood Bowl, but Blood Bowl, isn't Blood Bowl like a turn-based strategy game?
[324:30.22]It's not what I'm looking for.
[324:38.77]I want NBA Street.
[324:40.17]You could do these crazy moves where the ball went under your leg, they went behind your back, you did like a backflip, and then you did a huge slam dunk.
[324:45.93]Before you slam dunked, right before the ball went in the net, you passed it to your teammate, you were in the air, then he goes in the air, you pass it back to the guy that goes into the air, and you just have two front flip slam dunks, and it was like four million points.
[324:56.12]I loved it.
[324:57.94]It was like Tony Hawk.
[324:59.04]It was like Tony Hawk with sports.
[325:03.18]What am I doing?
[325:04.36]How do I get over there?
[325:16.48]You're ranting.
[325:18.22]Yeah, I know I am because like what have they done to sports video games?
[325:33.12]I was supposed to switch games.
[325:34.16]Oh, right, right, right.
[325:35.60]What did I just do?
[325:45.15]I want a wrestling game.
[325:46.59]I want a wrestling game where the rules can be crazy.
[325:49.97]I want the ring to be covered in ice and just have AI fight each other and see what they do.
[325:56.85]How fun would that be?
[325:57.99]It'd be fun just to do that.
[326:08.19]And then you got WWE, and the last WWE 2K game was so fucking awful that they stopped making it for like two years because they were like, holy shit, we gotta try to make this even remotely good.
[326:19.36]I hope they do.
[326:25.26]I hope they go back and do it the way that it was done like six or seven years ago.
[326:37.83]And that's not Boomer.
[326:39.01]This is not like, oh, the way things used to be.
[326:41.29]I'm talking about like five years ago, not like 20.
[326:43.81]We're talking like five or six years ago.
[326:54.52]This game sucks.
[326:56.56]This game is awful.
[327:03.71]Like I'm talking like 2014, 2013.
[327:08.39]How long ago was that?
[327:08.99]That was like seven years ago.
[327:10.17]But whatever, you get it.
[327:11.01]It's not that long ago.
[327:11.87]It's within ten years.
[327:21.46]Why are you still playing it?
[327:22.64]Well, because it's, I don't know, it's a means to deliver my rant to you.
[327:26.86]It's not a means to deliver a gameplay video.
[327:31.26]What happened?
[327:33.36]The outsider drugged you and Drake here retrieved the antidote I am very grateful to you Drake
[327:41.69]I know it is not much, but accept these gauntlets as a small sign of my appreciation.
[327:49.37]They will help protect your hands and forearms.
[327:53.31]I hate to be a bother, but if you are on your way back to the forest, I would appreciate it if you could bring this eggshell extract to the herbalist there.
[328:04.80]I am sure she would reward you for its delivery.
[328:09.96]I've got a couple of options.
[328:17.08]Deliver the eggshell extract to the herbalist at the forest outpost.
[328:21.16]Well, I have to play this because otherwise, when am I ever going to play this again?
[328:25.49]There's no reason to.
[328:26.49]I have it.
[328:29.07]This game's terrible.
[328:29.97]We thought there was going to be a T-Rex and shit, and it's not.
[328:31.83]It's just like talking animals in the game.
[328:36.35]Alright, here we go.
[328:39.66]It turns out I did not throw it in the trash.
[328:42.28]I have it right here.
[328:44.56]And if there's ever going to be like an Xbox dog shit grab bag night, this is the time to do this.
[328:50.61]So let's put it in.
[328:57.00]It's Halo 2.
[329:20.29]Come on, load.
[329:49.13]It's the other one, the one that I thought I threw in the trash.
[329:53.49]Turns out it's right here.
[330:09.32]Single player?
[330:10.98]Great character.
[330:12.06]Aren't you the king?
[330:17.76]Have it your way.
[330:19.02]Customize your character.
[330:20.12]Am I going to add pickles and relish and mustard to my character?
[330:24.91]Like on the shirt?
[330:36.51]Okay, select character.
[330:37.46]Okay.
[330:45.19]How is this customizing?
[330:46.57]I'll be Brett.
[330:48.51]Hair, hat, helmet.
[330:52.29]You really want to save?
[330:53.27]What?
[331:01.99]This is not... This is just... I don't... Why even put this in?
[331:05.15]I need to make, like, a lettuce tomato.
[331:15.61]I'm like pickles.
[331:22.65]It's the Joker.
[331:23.37]What's your name for your character?
[331:27.92]Didn't they already have a name?
[331:38.35]Arthur.
[331:39.11]No, I don't care about this.
[331:53.66]I'm going to play this for 15 minutes.
[331:55.14]I don't need to make him.
[331:56.40]I don't need to name him.
[331:57.98]You're going to forget about him tomorrow.
[332:05.79]He made Jeff Hardy.
[332:06.93]He does look like Jeff Hardy.
[332:19.71]I'm not angry.
[332:20.21]What are you talking about?
[332:34.59]I can't believe you said this is going to be Halo 2.
[332:46.19]Okay.
[332:47.75]Uh, rides?
[332:48.87]Rides.
[332:52.21]Garage.
[332:52.69]Alright, my car is going to be the green one.
[332:57.48]And then rides.
[332:58.32]The broiler, the deep, king's court.
[333:01.78]Alright, we're going to go to king's court.
[333:06.31]You probably guessed the way this is played.
[333:07.81]It hit the puck into your opponent's goal.
[333:09.93]Wait, did they make Rocket League before Rocket League?
[333:15.15]This would be wild if this is what this is.
[333:16.51]This is Rocket League.
[333:40.34]Chicken.
[333:40.70]I didn't even pick a character.
[333:45.03]Who am I?
[333:45.89]What team am I on?
[333:54.60]I'm on red team.
[333:55.32]I just won.
[333:58.60]You're always the king.
[334:00.46]Well, what's the point of customizing a character if I always have to play as the king?
[334:08.92]This looks like the floor of a public bathroom, I'll just tell you.
[334:10.84]What do you mean, own goal?
[334:22.52]You can choose the characters?
[334:23.84]I don't care to choose the characters.
[334:35.19]Oh god, I can't wait to play Blink's the Cat.
[334:38.35]We have to get the really shitty ones out first.
[334:40.90]I'm getting motion sick.
[334:59.22]I got one more I want to play tonight.
[335:01.28]And this one could be really good.
[335:03.06]And I mean incredibly.
[335:05.00]It's possible.
[335:06.00]We'll see.
[335:06.98]I have high hopes for the final game.
[335:20.28]Get out of here.
[335:21.56]Get out of my goal.
[335:28.13]The frame rate.
[335:28.59]The frame rate is making me motion sick.
[335:30.33]It actually is.
[335:34.03]Oh, this hurts.
[335:34.97]I'm actually going to throw up.
[335:36.21]I'm going to stop playing.
[335:38.63]I feel terrible.
[335:40.09]I feel awful right now.
[335:42.49]Oh my god, I feel awful.
[335:43.82]I feel awful.
[335:54.24]Ugh.
[336:01.75]Are they all the same?
[336:02.51]Oh, they're all the same, aren't they?
[336:08.13]This is every Mario Party game.
[336:09.63]I got you.
[336:15.06]Never mind.
[336:25.38]That was way worse than any... Okay, I'm done.
[336:27.68]I'm going to play the game I want to play.
[336:30.40]The game I'm about to put in
[336:32.96]is uh it had it has a lot of potential remember all these Xbox games are all based on potential uh we're gonna play omerta city of gangsters yeah I'm not gonna give this 30 minutes this game's horrible isn't this one on pc it actually might be I got it on my Xbox
[337:02.64]I thought we were going to play Blinks.
[337:04.14]That will be for another night.
[337:09.06]Why do I do that?
[337:10.90]What's the point of me doing that?
[337:19.49]What's wrong with this?
[337:23.25]Hit it in there.
[337:23.65]Come on, let's go.
[337:25.79]Alright, re-disk.
[337:36.05]Come on, let's hurry up.
[337:37.05]Load it up.
[337:44.24]Download to human if this doesn't work.
[337:45.96]It's gonna take me, like, an hour to download that game through original Xbox 360.
[337:58.48]Hold on, why is that name familiar?
[337:59.81]What else did they do today?
[338:01.89]Wait, they made...
[338:05.27]They made the Templar game.
[338:11.03]The first Templar was Calypso.
[338:12.07]Let's give it a try.
[338:25.80]New game.
[338:26.10]Let's just do it.
[338:28.22]Character's name.
[338:29.34]The boss.
[338:38.59]Uh, I'm gonna, this part, I connect with this guy the most, I think.
[338:45.45]He just kind of has, he looks like, could be me.
[338:49.02]You grew up in a small village in Sicily.
[338:50.66]Your childhood nickname was?
[338:51.86]Uh, obviously, Betty's.
[338:56.00]When you grew up enough, your father decided that you should learn diligence and learn a trade.
[339:02.20]You became an apprentice to?
[339:04.64]Stone's, uh, the shopkeeper.
[339:07.73]The most ridiculous feat you managed to pull off during your youth was stealing the key for the village mayor's wine cellar and drinking most of it before you were discovered, wrestling an enraged bull with your bare hands, sweet-talking a local loan shark to forgive your debt, and give you even more money just until you get back on your feet.
[339:29.53]That one, I've always seen.
[339:30.93]When you were 16 years old, you fell in love with the prettiest girl in the village.
[339:34.25]Her brother challenged you to a duel.
[339:36.77]Since you were challenged, you got to pick the weapon.
[339:38.85]It was... Wait, just pick a gun and shoot him?
[339:47.97]A knife.
[339:49.83]A bare fists.
[339:51.17]You let your enemy pick, confident you can beat him with every weapon.
[339:59.00]Let's go with that one.
[340:01.32]You're ready to select your difficulty level.
[340:02.60]Medium.
[340:02.88]Let's go.
[340:03.70]America.
[340:29.82]Here I am, fresh off the boat.
[340:32.56]Five bucks in my pocket, dreaming the American dream.
[340:34.68]Negative one?
[340:35.34]I had to get my feet on the ground pretty damn quick.
[340:40.76]Wait, why did I punch that guy?
[340:41.88]In the land of the brave, we could go unpunished.
[340:46.80]In the land of the free, freedom is an expensive commodity.
[340:50.26]Yeah, why is the audio mixing so bad on the Xbox?
[340:53.50]Success is never about hard work or fate cutting you some slack right when you need it.
[341:00.52]Success comes from giving the people what they need when they need it.
[341:07.81]Select district.
[341:08.55]Maine Ev.
[341:09.41]I can only go to Maine.
[341:11.03]Let's save the game.
[341:12.05]Sure.
[341:13.99]Okay, Maine Ev.
[341:21.78]I got a drink five minutes after I arrived in Atlantic City.
[341:25.44]The prohibition hasn't changed much here.
[341:28.16]Okay.
[341:28.50]Squigs.
[341:28.82]What do I have to do?
[341:30.17]Squigs.
[341:30.55]This looks like Tropico.
[341:31.65]I don't even know how this game is going to play.
[342:09.23]Buddy squigs It's by the xx calm guys is this the Tropico is the same people Alright, let's go come on Hand view zoom in and out and rotate the view.
[342:29.54]Oh

[342:40.61]Move the camera to explore the district.
[342:45.09]Alright.
[342:46.45]I just like your hideout.
[342:48.19]Alright, hold on.
[342:48.83]People are saying the audio is horrible.
[342:55.62]Alright, let's go.
[342:56.18]Alright, get this shit out of here.
[342:58.82]It's better.
[343:11.20]Alright, over the hideout.
[343:12.02]Alright, this is... This panel holds important information about the selected building.
[343:19.90]Close this by pressing B. Take place to hide when things get rough.
[343:26.33]I wish I have a neck like that one day.
[343:32.15]I really... Sometimes I do.
[343:33.11]There's a shop across the street from our home.
[343:37.75]You can use buildings with the question marks lined above them to gather information about the neighborhood.
[343:42.84]Okay.
[343:43.56]Is this a shop?
[343:44.04]It's a red crab.
[343:48.34]Shop.
[343:48.54]Is this a shop?
[343:54.33]Is this a shop?
[343:59.07]Unknown building.
[344:00.45]Send the boss to gather information in the shop across the street.
[344:02.91]Oh.
[344:09.40]Okay.
[344:09.98]The shopkeeper has heard every rumor and knows everything about everyone.
[344:14.69]Either of these actions will allow you to learn more about the district.
[344:18.43]Big spender or cheers.
[344:20.05]Alright.
[344:20.29]Big spender.
[344:22.51]Send the boss on this assignment.
[344:25.06]Send somebody to get the information you need.
[344:26.62]The boss is a mastermind.
[344:27.74]I want to look like this in like 50 years.
[344:39.97]You look at like old paintings of that's like a Benjamin Franklin issue.
[344:42.51]You look like old paintings of people who look like this Just like well in fact that guy looked like he... That guy looked like he fucking meant business You already do I don't look like that Like that's like what they put the powdered wig on this guy and he's just like wow that was a fucking that guy must have been important or something

[345:08.74]And give him like a big frilly thing around his neck.
[345:15.60]I wait for the boss's return.
[345:16.62]Is he going in?
[345:19.28]Where am I?
[345:19.80]Oh, that's me.
[345:24.62]Can I look in here?
[345:25.36]It's because of the turkey neck.
[345:30.60]Okay.
[345:32.88]Okay.
[345:35.92]Looks like you found a couple of independent breweries, boss.
[345:39.38]We can steal some beer from them.
[345:44.18]Okay, raid an independent brewery.
[345:48.90]Can I die?
[345:56.14]Raid.
[345:56.48]20 beer and gain heat.
[346:01.70]A real boss ain't afraid of grunt work.
[346:04.03]There are far too many opportunities for you to handle alone, boss.
[346:08.27]Why don't you bring in Squiggs to help?
[346:10.37]Oh, here comes Squiggs.
[346:11.49]We all love this guy.
[346:12.11]You can hire additional gangsters and send them on assignments.
[346:16.26]This way you can run multiple assignments at the same time.
[346:19.14]Portrait of a silhouette with a question mark represents an empty slot for a henchman.
[346:23.10]Use LBRB.
[346:24.16]Press A to view the available henchmen.
[346:25.66]Okay.

[346:39.74]Okay, gather 40 beer casks.
[346:40.82]Casks.
[346:41.12]Okay.

[347:08.07]Raid song?
[347:08.67]For what?
[347:13.37]Am I in there?
[347:13.89]How do I send him on the mission?
[347:22.79]These all sound like Family Guy characters.
[347:24.45]They kind of do.
[347:24.95]Oh, I returned with 20 beer.
[347:28.80]Uh, do it again.
[347:37.40]It's for raiding the brewery.
[347:40.57]Ah!

[347:59.36]Raid.
[348:04.34]This action will be available in 270 seconds.
[348:13.05]What do you mean 270 seconds?
[348:23.65]It's a mobile game.
[348:24.91]No, it's not.
[348:27.05]It's not!
[348:31.77]Why is that in here?
[348:33.19]No, it's just that it's... Go to other breweries.
[348:42.50]Here we go, raid it.
[348:44.30]Start the raid.
[348:45.14]I'm in a rush, boss.
[348:51.40]Cool down so you don't keep raiding the same place over and over again.
[348:53.50]That makes sense.

[351:53.18]You thought we were going out on some boring time management game?
[351:57.24]I don't think so.
[352:05.85]It's time for Nicktoons MLB.

[352:49.58]The Meteors, the Raccoons, the Sonic Booms, the Orioles.
[352:53.67]What?
[352:57.27]Oh, these are actual teams.
[353:00.71]Oh, there's the Boston Red Sox.
[353:04.25]No, I don't want to be a real team.
[353:07.59]I want to be the Boppers.
[353:11.23]The Boppers versus the Red Sox.
[353:14.64]Nice, I'm ready.
[353:16.50]Time to draft by Nicktoons.
[353:18.02]So... Okay, so we have to... We pick.
[353:21.02]Powder Toastman first pick.
[353:22.74]Powder Toastman first pick.
[353:24.00]I don't care if Powder Toastman's first pick.
[353:25.62]Every time.
[353:25.94]This is absolutely first pick.
[353:44.59]He's a pitcher.

[354:23.81]I don't even know.
[354:24.49]Ultra Lord?
[354:25.51]Oh, I see.

[355:09.11]Wait, do they have Fenway Park?
[355:11.22]Alright, we have to go here.
[355:12.48]This is too weird.
[355:14.74]He is.

[355:39.38]What was it?
[355:40.32]Was it NBA?
[355:41.64]NFL?
[355:42.44]It was like SpongeBob would come on the screen.
[355:45.00]Coby Ellsbury.
[355:48.94]This is old.
[355:49.66]Okay, let's see.
[355:51.68]Throwing smoke.
[355:54.38]To throw a pitch, aim and select the pitch.
[355:56.00]Release the button at the top of the meter.
[355:57.82]Shut up.
[356:00.74]Release the button at the top of the meter for a perfect pitch.
[356:03.71]Okay.
[356:03.93]What do we got?
[356:05.81]That's okay.
[356:06.11]You don't want to throw it.
[356:06.65]You want to throw it in the cold zone, right?
[356:08.41]That's not their hot zone, right?
[356:09.41]What do we got for pitches?
[356:11.97]Alright, we're going to go two-steam fastball.
[356:18.12]Turbo is earned by throwing strikes or taking balls at the plate.
[356:22.54]When a segment of the meter is full, activate a turbo pitch.
[356:29.05]Alright, we're going to get a curveball to drop a little bit out of the zone.
[356:31.82]Sounds like a good play to me.
[356:32.92]There it is.
[356:34.98]Alright, now we're going to really challenge him here.
[356:38.60]I'm going to go up and in.
[356:39.46]I'm going to go up and in in the strike zone.
[356:41.75]He's going to be really tempted to swing at it.
[356:43.09]He thinks I'm throwing the ball.
[356:46.61]Got him.
[356:47.33]Got him.
[356:55.46]Alright, I don't... I hate this character.
[356:59.55]I don't know.
[357:01.25]I hate this character.
[357:02.09]I think this character is stupid.
[357:04.27]Can I throw at him?
[357:05.61]Alright, I can't do that.
[357:12.22]Let's go change up.
[357:14.60]Should I go right in the middle?
[357:15.36]Oh, foul ball.
[357:20.72]I'm going curveball, dropping out of the zone.
[357:22.48]Oops.
[357:22.70]Oops.
[357:24.68]I have a turbo meter.
[357:27.02]How do I use it?
[357:28.30]Throw a perfect game for a billion off the debt.
[357:33.46]I don't think I can throw a perfect game.
[357:35.40]I don't think it's possible.
[357:40.41]I'll try.
[357:40.97]I'll try.
[357:41.33]Can I get that as a deal?
[357:42.47]I'll try.
[357:42.93]Oh my god.
[357:45.49]No, no.
[357:45.71]I don't want to use that.
[357:46.49]I don't want to use that.
[357:47.05]How do I take that off?
[357:49.45]How do I take off the turbo mode?
[357:57.11]Deal.
[357:57.45]Alright, I'm going to really try.
[357:58.61]What's the count here?
[358:00.27]3 and 2.
[358:00.41]Alright, I'm going to throw a changeup.
[358:02.11]Right out here.
[358:02.62]That's not a perfect game.
[358:09.96]The fielder is automatically selected for you.
[358:12.42]Run him towards the ball and he will make the catch if he is close enough.
[358:16.59]And then you choose a base.
[358:18.03]Alright, how about a no-hitter?
[358:20.09]How about a no-hitter?
[358:22.49]Because, yeah, that's not a perfect game, right?
[358:24.69]Well, actually, no, it is.
[358:27.10]Throw the ball base, press the action, yeah.
[358:30.42]Got him.
[358:37.08]No one has to, no one can make it to first base.
[358:39.26]Okay.
[358:43.57]Wait, I thought the hot, I've been pitching it in their hot zones.
[358:50.59]Here we go.
[358:51.99]Zoomers don't understand baseball.
[358:55.78]Dude, why do this shit?
[358:57.50]You want to get us to be interested in sports again?
[359:01.14]They got to get... Just hold off.
[359:06.26]I'm working on it, okay?
[359:08.40]I'm working on it.
[359:09.52]I'm working on it.
[359:10.38]It was supposed to be there a year ago.
[359:12.51]I'm working on it.
[359:13.75]Just wait.
[359:20.47]Right here.
[359:23.60]perfect pitch last August I was supposed to do a stream and just wait alright I'm fucking working on it it's gonna be it's gonna be my favorite stream ever it will be the my most favorite thing I've ever done on YouTube Twitch doesn't matter it'll be my favorite thing I've ever done strike three sit on okay out of here perfect game is intact
[359:54.85]Alright, time to win.
[360:01.99]SpongeBob!
[360:03.71]Okay, hit the ball.
[360:06.75]Aim your hit into the field and do a contact swing for a good chance at a hit.
[360:10.89]Allowing hits will cause the pitcher's effectiveness to decrease.
[360:12.78]Alright, how do we do a power swing?
[360:20.73]Direct your runner towards the base that you want to go to.
[360:23.61]Use the base radar to see where you are.
[360:25.67]So, okay, left stick, aim towards the base you want to go to.
[360:28.77]That's a double.
[360:29.89]No, it's not.
[360:30.98]No, it's not.
[360:31.32]Stay back.
[360:33.36]What's the power swing?
[360:36.78]What is this?
[360:38.52]Okay, for a second, I was like, what cartoon character is this guy?
[360:47.18]Aim your hit into the field and execute a bunt.
[360:49.98]Bunting moves your... I'm not sacrifice bunting.
[360:52.34]Why would I do that?
[360:55.45]Sacrifice bunt?
[360:56.51]Up there.
[360:56.97]I just hit into a double play.
[361:00.81]Shit.
[361:06.21]Go, go!
[361:07.01]What are you doing?
[361:07.61]Run to second base!
[361:09.05]Run to second base!
[361:17.11]Wait, isn't... Alright, power swing.
[361:20.85]Seems he's going to hit a home run right now over the monster.
[361:27.54]Okay, left bumper is move all your runners to the next position.
[361:33.78]Yes, that's what I want.
[361:35.13]Get down it!
[361:36.05]Everybody go!
[361:37.53]Okay.
[361:42.54]It's one to nothing.
[361:46.44]Alright, here's a random person.
[361:49.76]To steal, you have to first initiate a lead off.
[361:52.60]Okay.
[361:54.02]Who should I steal with?
[361:57.32]It's a hit and run.
[361:58.50]Get in.
[362:01.81]Two to nothing.
[362:04.83]Why is Timmy so big?
[362:05.79]For a second, I did not know who this was.
[362:09.91]I was like, who is this weird ant character?
[362:16.62]Shit.
[362:16.92]How weak is Ren?
[362:18.68]Snippy, get up.
[362:19.24]Why is Snippy sleeping?
[362:21.72]No!
[362:21.86]Shit.
[362:22.08]It's alright.
[362:48.06]This really does look like a GTA mod.
[362:54.99]The Flying Dutchman sucks.
[362:57.73]The Flying Dutchman sucks so bad.
[363:02.87]GTA mod.
[363:05.21]I can't get over it.
[363:05.95]Okay, perfect game.
[363:06.97]Come on.
[363:08.89]I gotta throw a perfect game.
[363:10.09]And apparently, just browsing, strike one.
[363:17.22]All the time it would take to do this.
[363:19.34]It would take so much time to make a GTA mod like this.
[363:22.66]And why would you do this?
[363:29.25]I need to build my meter.
[363:38.37]Who the fuck is the pitcher?
[363:41.99]That's powdered toast man.
[363:45.26]That's strikeout.
[363:52.82]People think the picture is SpongeBob.
[364:01.82]Why would you think that?
[364:04.67]Hold on.
[364:05.63]What are you talking about?
[364:08.39]It does kind of look like SpongeBob.
[364:14.26]Alright, I gotta settle down.
[364:15.08]I need to get a perfect game.
[364:21.18]Uh-oh, shit, he just turbo-moded.
[364:23.22]Uh-oh.
[364:24.44]I'm counter-turboing.
[364:27.64]Eat shit, motherfucker!
[364:31.29]Yes!
[364:35.37]Uh-oh, David Ortiz.
[364:37.15]Oh, I was going to say, why don't I get David Ortiz?
[364:40.59]He's going to get a home run.
[364:49.51]Stay away from David Ortiz.
[364:53.78]Oh, no!
[364:55.62]It's a foul ball.
[364:58.04]I'm good.
[364:58.62]It's a foul ball.
[365:07.98]Are we 1-1?
[365:10.12]Curveball in the dirt.
[365:10.74]Let's go.
[365:13.40]Come on.
[365:13.76]Swing at that.
[365:14.44]David Ortiz had so much trouble hitting curveballs down.
[365:19.88]Again.
[365:22.22]Furball down.
[365:25.10]Come on!
[365:25.60]Swing at it!
[365:29.51]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[365:36.61]I'm good.
[365:38.93]If you feel it can't make the catch, switch to the fielder with the next best chance as left trigger.
[365:42.65]Come on, Chaos!
[365:46.05]And everyone told me to not put Gaz on the team.
[365:48.87]You see how fast that she just threw that ball.
[365:51.65]Oh.
[365:51.89]Get Gaz off the team.
[365:53.31]Who's Gaz?
[365:54.03]Who?
[365:54.19]OmegaLol.
[365:54.81]Okay.
[365:55.13]Who and now?
[365:56.09]Watch this shit.
[365:56.77]Whatever.
[365:57.35]I don't know who this person is.
[366:01.06]Alright.
[366:01.60]I'm going to take a pitch.
[366:18.46]Wow, they still do steroids.
[366:20.76]That's a good hit.
[366:22.37]I hate that character.
[366:23.35]It looks like Brian Griffin or something.
[366:26.71]Wait, they took out?
[366:27.55]They took Sheen out?
[366:28.57]Already subbing out Sheen?
[366:47.37]GTA mod.
[366:48.53]That's going to make me laugh.
[366:52.01]I'm going to be like in the bathtub tonight and I'm going to be laughing hysterically.
[366:55.56]I'm going to be just sitting with like just relaxing with my eyes closed.
[366:59.34]And I'm just going to start.
[367:00.24]It's going to hurt.
[367:00.62]I'm going to start laughing hard.
[367:01.58]Shit.
[367:01.90]Come on, SpongeBob.
[367:03.10]Get with it here.
[367:19.35]It's alright.
[367:20.31]Should I sub a pitcher in?
[367:22.59]Or should we keep, um, part of Toastman?
[367:28.61]How's part of Toastman doing?
[367:35.78]Can I warm somebody up?
[367:38.08]Part of Toastman for S. Knight.
[367:40.61]No.
[367:40.77]I don't know who that is.
[367:41.73]That's not a funny character.
[367:46.86]No, it has to stay as... It has to... It has to stay as part of Toastman.
[367:52.38]Otherwise, it's not a perfect game.
[367:54.78]Uh-oh.
[367:59.71]Oh, shit.
[368:03.81]I have to throw a strike because he did turbo mode.
[368:06.33]Alright, we're just going up and in.
[368:07.65]No, we're not.
[368:09.14]Change up.
[368:09.56]Down.
[368:10.12]Change up.
[368:10.74]Down and away.
[368:11.44]It's the longest you have to wait for a pitch.
[368:13.64]Got it.
[368:17.16]I'm safe.
[368:19.84]I can't throw a ball when he's in turbo mode.
[368:26.08]Alright, two strikes.
[368:29.61]Curveball in the dirt.
[368:32.89]He's gonna fucking swing and miss.
[368:35.35]Anything up and in?
[368:35.99]Fast?
[368:47.77]Come on, B slider.
[368:48.93]Get it.
[368:51.08]I lose.
[368:51.30]No perfect game.
[368:52.72]Damn it.
[368:54.62]How do I... How do I pick off?
[369:18.98]Oh, no, I don't get it.
[369:20.62]No debt wipe.
[369:21.36]I didn't throw a perfect game.
[369:23.68]Of course it was Patrick that did it.
[369:31.15]You lost to Patrick.
[369:32.73]You're not adding debt.
[369:33.65]What do you mean?
[369:39.01]Line touch was so bad.
[369:42.63]He keeps making errors in the field.
[369:45.21]Turbo hit activated.
[369:46.23]Oh, no.
[369:46.73]Okay.
[369:47.19]Um.
[369:50.52]Split finger fastball down and in.
[369:54.99]Painting the corners there.
[369:56.29]That's a strike.
[369:58.85]I can't get over the GTA mod thing.
[370:03.73]So funny.
[370:09.85]He's got nothing.
[370:10.83]I'm going up and in.
[370:11.57]Fastball.
[370:12.35]Let's challenge him.
[370:14.11]High and tight for a strike.
[370:17.42]Okay.
[370:17.88]Keep in mind, the flying... They used two of their turbos on the Flying Dutchman.
[370:21.81]And he's going to swing and miss right now.
[370:25.51]Absolutely pathetic.
[370:26.95]What a waste of two meters.
[370:28.97]Only two nothing.
[370:30.37]I can still lose.
[370:31.47]This is gaming?
[370:32.70]Oh, yeah.
[370:53.22]Perfect.
[370:54.84]Nice pitch for strike two.
[370:56.86]It looks like SpongeBob.
[370:59.87]People thought it was SpongeBob.
[371:01.29]That's my favorite thing ever.
[371:04.71]God damn it.
[371:05.59]I can't believe Patrick of all people.

[371:13.74]Where are you getting this?
[371:15.54]I want to hit a home run.
[371:16.28]Stepping in for the second time.
[371:17.94]CJ Ryder.
[371:19.38]This one is one for one.
[371:24.93]You could have caught that normally you didn't have to jump across the whole game There's the movie angels in the outfield Alright, sorry That happens in angels in the outfield

[371:54.72]It's alright.

[372:04.99]He's fast.
[372:05.75]God damn it.
[372:07.75]Ren looks like a bug.
[372:10.97]He looks like an ant.
[372:11.47]Oh, man.

[372:55.69]Down the middle.
[372:57.09]Strike one.
[372:58.81]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[373:00.45]Perfect game is off.
[373:04.79]This is so fun.
[373:06.23]It's so fun.
[373:08.45]And there's no simulation.
[373:11.20]It's not real.
[373:11.86]It doesn't have to be real.
[373:13.48]It's just fun.
[373:26.20]Split fingered.
[373:27.48]Out of the way.
[373:28.78]Mario Super Sluggers is better.

[374:18.20]Paint it right on the edge.
[374:20.87]Gonzalez is down on strike.
[374:25.65]I almost have a full meter.
[374:27.19]If I get a full meter, is it a guaranteed home run?
[374:29.68]That's what I'm waiting for.
[374:30.40]I hate that character.
[374:31.36]Every time I see him, it makes me angry.
[374:34.54]Alright, Gaz.
[374:34.88]Here we go.

[375:32.93]There's only one more inning.
[375:54.15]Got him bunt.
[375:54.67]Oh, they're so bad.
[375:56.33]Little bunt.
[376:01.39]Alright, SpongeBob.
[376:02.11]Put him in the seats.
[376:05.73]Come on.
[376:06.65]That was right down the middle.
[376:08.94]It was not too late.
[376:24.19]That's down the line.
[376:26.35]That's a fair ball.
[376:27.13]Go, go, go, go, go.
[376:28.05]That's a fair ball.
[376:28.61]Go, go, go, go, go, go.

[377:11.12]It's not perfect.
[377:12.24]Not a perfect game.
[377:12.88]It's a shutout, but it's not a perfect game.
[377:15.46]It's coming in.
[377:18.73]I want to play another one.
[377:23.77]I'm going to play another game.
[377:25.07]I want to see the other Nicktoon characters.
[377:26.69]You have to pick a different team.
[377:39.63]Or is it just random?
[377:40.39]Like a random pool of the characters.
[377:43.45]Two down.
[377:48.73]Here he is, Patrick.
[377:55.93]Only reason.
[377:58.65]Postman is rolling right now.
[378:00.25]Yeah, he is.
[378:00.81]He's really good.
[378:04.54]We have to embarrass Patrick because he embarrassed me.
[378:08.64]Strike three.
[378:11.08]No.
[378:11.32]That's it.
[378:18.90]The Boppers win.
[378:19.92]That's so fun.
[378:21.66]CatDog is in this game?
[378:26.16]Wait, CatDog is in the game.
[378:27.90]What am I doing?
[378:28.79]What am I unlocking?
[378:46.37]Alright, let's do the pickup game.
[378:47.95]Okay, I'm going to be on the home team again.
[378:52.36]And let's be on the goofballs.
[378:56.98]Goofballs versus the Yankees.
[379:03.10]I hate Yankees.
[379:04.30]I'm going to show you how to pick your Nicktoons.
[379:09.58]Okay, there's new people here.

[379:27.61]Wait, who's the pitcher?
[379:30.73]Sheen's actually a good pitcher.
[379:47.09]It's all the same characters?
[379:48.79]How do I get new ones?
[379:54.08]Is there any way I can get new characters?
[379:58.08]You don't.
[379:59.72]These are new.
[380:00.26]Danny Phantom and Nesmith weren't here before.
[380:03.44]I think I'd want the Yak as a pitcher with that fastball.
[380:13.59]Pick your first baseman.
[380:16.93]Any phantom was not here.
[380:18.59]They were?

[382:19.98]This thing goes up to 95.

[383:18.89]First pitch is a strike.
[383:19.91]Damn it.

[385:04.88]I don't follow, girl.
[385:09.57]If you don't know who Alex Rodriguez is, then we are not in the same generation.
[385:18.37]At all.
[385:18.79]I'm probably like 15 plus years older than you.
[385:22.82]It's just weird to think about that, isn't it?
[385:24.68]It's very strange.
[385:27.42]I want to unlock the Aureal monsters.
[385:35.32]Fastball up for a strike.
[385:38.46]Who watches sports anymore?
[385:39.56]I mean, I don't.

[385:44.76]2004.
[385:44.78]I got Stimpy this time.
[385:46.02]Stimpy's got a lot of power.
[385:47.94]Nobody can hit this ball.
[385:54.48]Why is Larry the Lobster that color?
[386:07.59]Second pitch of the at bat.
[386:09.13]Was it red?
[386:12.21]Cracked down by Prince Zuko.
[386:15.77]Kill Bill.
[386:19.03]Zero, zero, zero.
[386:20.60]What a boring game of baseball.
[386:21.82]Alright, here we go.
[386:22.64]Here's Zuko.
[386:23.32]Oh, he had shitload of power.
[386:26.72]Yeah.
[386:28.06]Say goodbye.
[386:40.31]It's way too late.
[386:41.19]I don't think that has anything to do with the game.
[386:45.51]Oh!
[386:45.75]God damn it!
[386:46.57]I was... He has a stupid 78 mile per hour ball.
[386:51.49]Get out of the park.
[386:52.09]That's gone.
[386:53.73]See you later.
[386:55.55]Holy shit.
[386:58.92]I can't believe it.
[387:02.58]Coming up next, Great Scott.
[387:04.54]It was unbelievable.
[387:14.50]What's in there?
[387:15.38]Fuck you.
[387:21.77]That ball was on fire.
[387:22.87]Yeah, that was going out.
[387:23.75]That was absolutely out of the park.
[387:27.31]Tough puppies in the game, but fairly odd parents aren't.
[387:30.72]I think they are.
[387:31.42]I think that's just the... Yeah, why is Larry the Lobster looks ridiculous?
[387:41.79]That looks really just awful.
[387:47.89]Looks like a whoopee cushion.
[387:53.16]Oh, you want to do that?
[387:57.30]That's fine.
[388:00.10]I'll get it right down the middle for you.
[388:01.08]Good luck.
[388:07.44]Stepping in for the first time today, Nesmith.
[388:11.08]I've been waiting a great deal of my life for this moment.
[388:13.90]What is this character from?
[388:14.66]Is this Jimmy Neutron?
[388:17.94]Painting the corners there.
[388:19.54]That's a strike.
[388:24.53]Ladder.
[388:24.93]Hopping in.
[388:27.23]I think the axe is the best picture.
[388:28.87]Strike two.
[388:33.81]Hump says it's a ball.
[388:35.53]One and two.
[388:41.31]Nobody can keep up with this.
[388:43.53]I want to check out the tournament after this.
[388:46.37]I want to see if I can unlock people.
[388:54.09]The Yak is juicing.
[388:58.88]So wouldn't probably every single person you've seen on the screen so far.
[389:01.38]Real people.
[389:04.60]You remember back in like 2000, 2000, like 2001 to like 2006.
[389:06.10]Almost every single baseball player was on some kind of drug.
[389:08.63]Like 1998 to like 2005, 2007.
[389:09.25]Larry Lobster is stepping in.
[389:11.97]God, he looks so weird.
[389:12.55]There's nothing I can't hit.
[389:36.45]Finally, some action.
[389:38.85]Larry.
[389:39.49]Alright, let's do... I'm going from back to back to back home runs.
[389:53.36]It just sucks.
[389:55.44]I don't know.
[389:55.74]Who is this person?
[389:56.54]Alright, whoever you are, you're hitting a home run.
[390:08.60]Back to back.
[390:12.47]Take that back.
[390:17.53]That was always the show that came on Nickelodeon and I would just switch channels because I was like, eh, nah.

[391:09.90]Let's do it again.
[391:10.36]Oh, it's a different person.
[391:11.36]That might go out.
[391:11.94]Oh, no.
[391:32.97]They took him out.
[391:34.01]Where are all the Nicktoons characters?
[391:40.43]These are all just regular people.
[391:41.39]Fuck!
[391:41.55]I got greedy.
[391:42.35]Where are all the Nicktoons?
[391:43.92]Alright, there he is.

[391:59.55]Alright, stop grunting like a weirdo.
[392:06.28]It's Nicktoons baseball.

[392:40.78]I didn't hate that show.
[392:46.74]I did, but I didn't.
[393:03.90]Like the John Travolta character I thought was just annoying.
[393:07.34]It was like a bully.
[393:09.44]He was like, you gotta get away from me.
[393:12.76]That was really bad John Travolta.
[393:14.93]Whatever.
[393:17.47]I don't like that character.
[393:22.69]He was the best.
[393:23.49]No, it was just, I don't know.
[393:24.81]I don't like him.
[393:27.27]I like Chum Chum.
[393:29.80]Chum Chum.
[393:30.24]I love Chum Chum's voice.
[393:37.35]that's a strike inside corner the show is trash that's how I feel internally what you just said about how what you just said perhaps but you have to admit that that was a stunning play down the line alright go go go go that's at least two that wasn't with a leadoff single
[394:05.70]I remember I was a 27-year-old man when Chum Chum first aired.

[394:41.19]Home, home, home, home, home, home.
[394:42.25]Back, back, back, back, back.
[394:43.59]What the fuck was that move?
[394:47.63]25-year-old relating to... I didn't say I relate to Chum Chum.
[394:50.70]I said he was cute.
[394:52.38]He was like a cute character.
[394:53.52]He's like a little like, oh, he's cute.
[394:56.40]They like frosty freezies.
[394:59.00]I didn't buy Chum Chum merchandise.
[395:01.10]I thought the show was like cute.
[395:02.98]Maybe we could talk about baseball.
[395:06.45]I saw like four episodes total I was sick with the flu one day Sorry Unforgivable

[399:07.79]Third baseman.
[399:08.35]Gotta have somebody with an arm.
[399:11.72]Sandy.
[399:20.13]Sandy.
[399:25.27]No, no.
[399:27.05]No arm.
[399:28.47]Third base has got to be somebody with a strong arm.
[399:30.10]It's got to be Sandy.
[399:30.68]Sandy.
[399:40.63]I'm ready.

[400:14.31]Now I'm no longer playing for fun.
[400:20.01]Alright, SpongeBob.
[400:22.49]I should have picked SpongeBob.
[400:23.31]That was a mistake.
[400:24.59]Alright, Gaz has a Cutter.
[400:28.21]Oh my god.
[400:33.14]Gaz is even cooler.
[400:34.48]She throws Submarine.
[400:37.48]Even cooler.
[400:38.38]She throws Submarine.
[400:41.66]And look at the Ghost Trail.
[400:46.64]Sinker.
[400:49.12]Hey, steady diet of sinkers means ground balls all game.
[400:55.93]Alright, that's two.
[401:02.57]Steady diet of sinkers, low.
[401:04.71]Ground balls, all game.
[401:06.04]Shit.
[401:06.82]Full count.
[401:20.18]Victory.
[401:24.62]Screwball.
[401:25.25]You know what a screwball is?
[401:27.83]Screwball is a curveball that goes the other way.
[401:30.73]And you have to spin the baseball the other way.
[401:32.79]You have to move your wrist.
[401:34.45]You have to flick your wrist to the left if you're a right-handed pitcher.
[401:38.25]If you throw a screwball, you just fuck up your elbow.
[401:40.83]Everybody that's ever thrown a screwball has tons of problems.
[401:44.02]Because with a curveball, you come down and you spin kind of the ball.
[401:47.86]You spin to the right side if you're a right-handed pitcher.
[401:51.06]You have to flick your wrist like left while you throw as hard as you can to have the ball go the other direction.
[401:57.90]A screwball is a curveball that goes the other way.
[402:01.38]It breaks the other way.
[402:03.98]It literally fucks up your whole body.
[402:08.98]I think there's only like five people in Major League Baseball that's ever actually thrown a screwball.
[402:14.84]Because it's guaranteed to break you.
[402:22.90]I don't care about baseball lore.
[402:25.62]Oh, Danny Phantom.
[402:26.58]Throw it at his head.
[402:32.59]Come on, computer.
[402:33.67]Computer is not winning this game.
[402:38.53]Focus.
[402:38.89]I have money on the line.
[402:39.71]What about me?
[402:43.46]I stand to want to win this too.
[402:45.86]Cut her up and in.
[402:48.69]In the strike zone.
[402:50.65]There it is.
[402:51.01]Alright, Patrick.
[402:52.43]Going for power.
[402:52.97]We all have money on the line.
[403:15.06]M cannon?
[403:17.58]Oh, Powder Toast Man is so hard.
[403:19.22]It's a 70 mile per hour curveball and it arcs from 12 to 6.
[403:24.66]Oh, he's so good.
[403:32.23]It's so hard to hit that.
[403:35.59]Really?
[403:35.83]Let's go.
[403:40.23]Whoa!
[403:41.29]Ha ha ha ha!
[403:43.95]That's fine.
[403:51.39]The Power Toast Man's so good.
[403:53.27]Why did I not pick Power Toast Man?
[404:02.02]Stop swinging at balls.
[404:05.50]That's like being in the corner of a box room going, hey, hey, stop getting punched in the face.
[404:13.09]It's not as easy as you think it is.
[404:14.01]It's fine.
[404:17.65]It's fine.
[404:18.09]Why did you bet on me?
[404:18.87]You bet on me because I'm going to win.
[404:44.99]How do you dive?
[404:45.73]How do you dive?
[404:46.81]How do you dive?
[404:48.43]I don't know, but I got it.
[404:54.00]Oh god.
[404:54.42]He's so good.
[405:05.16]He's probably the best character.
[405:17.02]It's alright.
[405:19.08]How do you dive?
[405:21.72]I have to know how to dive.
[405:26.12]Batting.
[405:27.56]Running.
[405:28.28]Pitching.
[405:29.56]Fielding.
[405:30.88]Turbo.
[405:34.67]Turbo.
[405:36.89]Defense.
[405:37.21]Fielding.
[405:37.43]Where's dive?
[405:37.89]I mean, there's definitely a dive.
[405:44.41]We've seen people do it.
[405:52.21]People have done it.
[405:52.77]We've seen people do it.
[405:53.41]Is it automatic?
[406:00.24]Is it A?
[406:00.90]It's A button.
[406:02.16]Oh, it's action.
[406:04.42]Okay.
[406:08.52]Person on first.
[406:11.44]We got it.
[406:12.20]How many outs?
[406:12.82]One out.
[406:13.86]Going for a double play right here.
[406:16.66]On the edge of the plate, umpire says strike.
[406:23.71]Double play.
[406:26.13]Ah.
[406:26.29]Split her down and in.
[406:27.65]Grab all.
[406:35.72]Oh, no.
[406:35.96]Um.
[406:36.10]Oh, shit.
[406:36.46]Somebody on base.
[406:57.33]Yes!
[406:58.29]I can't hit anything.
[407:02.13]That was huge.
[407:05.29]That was one of the biggest plays of the whole game.
[407:06.69]Still, okay.
[407:07.19]Two outs.
[407:13.00]I don't have to worry about a ground ball.
[407:16.65]Make him chase.
[407:17.11]What do you say?
[407:19.77]Who am I talking to?
[407:21.21]Us.
[407:21.39]Ren's going to strike out right here.
[407:26.82]He's going to leave a man on.
[407:32.74]What?
[407:33.08]That's right on the corner.
[407:34.00]That's...
[407:52.47]What the fuck is going on?
[407:53.29]I hate American sports.
[407:56.67]What?
[407:56.91]I mean, this is Nicktoons baseball.
[408:00.07]It's a little different.
[408:00.97]Alright.
[408:05.59]Here's all you need to know about American baseball.
[408:14.46]Get out.
[408:15.22]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[408:18.44]Slide.
[408:20.75]Alright.
[408:21.21]Here we go.
[408:21.63]This is it.
[408:22.18]Yeah.
[408:23.16]Nice hit.
[408:25.12]Pitcher throws ball.
[408:26.04]Batter tries to hit ball.
[408:27.62]If you catch ball in air, batter sit down.
[408:31.06]If ball on ground and batter not make to base... Let me hit a fucking home run real quick.
[408:36.44]I'm not going to swing at a turbo pitch.
[408:43.23]Now...
[408:52.85]Ooh, that could be.
[408:54.19]That's a run.
[408:54.57]Come on.
[408:56.17]You're so slow.
[408:56.87]Why are you so slow?
[408:57.65]Get the third!
[409:01.20]Oh!
[409:02.42]Yes!
[409:02.98]In the lead.
[409:07.08]How much power do you got?
[409:12.35]Oh my god.
[409:14.75]This is huge.
[409:15.33]This will be it.
[409:18.85]Get in there.
[409:19.87]That's another run.
[409:20.77]Imagine betting a... Go to... What are you doing?
[409:24.70]What the fuck happened?
[409:28.56]What just happened?
[409:32.76]Why did they go back?
[409:33.58]Oh, no.
[409:33.96]Okay.
[409:34.06]Alright.
[409:34.95]Alright.
[409:35.15]Alright.
[409:40.07]Alright.
[409:40.79]It's one out.
[409:45.15]One out.
[409:52.41]balls right oh that's so slow good thing I touched it relax it's fine why did I panic turbo that was stupid
[410:25.76]What are you talking about?
[410:26.92]Where's the replay?
[410:33.00]I don't think that has anything to do with the game.
[410:40.31]I want to see the replay.
[410:41.11]How did I get... Nobody tagged me.
[410:43.57]What?
[410:44.19]Okay, why does this person have full power in everything?
[410:48.27]They're not even in Nicktoon.
[410:52.33]Painting the corners there.
[410:53.63]That's a strike.
[411:03.79]That ball is smashed to deep center right.
[411:07.87]It's two to one.
[411:09.53]Who is that person?
[411:10.68]Why do they have full power and everything?
[411:16.64]Top of the third.
[411:17.72]Nobody out.
[411:18.92]What is going on with this?
[411:20.72]What is this?
[411:21.52]What is this?
[411:23.20]Full everything?
[411:35.30]That's so unfair.
[411:36.78]Fine.
[411:36.94]I'm not going to let it get to me.
[411:49.20]Up and in.
[411:49.68]Swing and miss.
[411:54.90]How come they have that?
[411:56.12]That's two or three people in a row.
[411:57.54]Ball two.
[412:04.48]Burritos.
[412:05.16]Down on strike.
[412:15.64]Okay, a SpongeBob.
[412:17.88]A SpongeBob is... Even SpongeBob has a ton of... Wait a minute.
[412:24.26]I think Gaz is tired.
[412:39.73]Gaz is tired.
[412:40.40]Alright, we're going to switch it.
[412:43.10]No, wait a minute.
[412:49.07]Is that accurate?
[412:49.83]It's only the third inning.
[412:53.21]There's no time to pretend.
[412:54.77]No, look at the stars down there.
[412:56.56]SpongeBob has like two extra stars.
[412:59.72]Why?
[413:03.00]Look at the stars.
[413:07.24]It's because it's on all-star difficulty.
[413:14.35]Oh, is that what it is?
[413:17.40]Well, I don't know.
[413:21.80]It's the first time I've played on All-Star.
[413:24.68]This is like insane.
[413:38.17]I would use the power-up right now, but I'm not gonna.
[413:43.12]I don't have faith.
[413:44.40]You're not gonna hit shit.
[413:53.70]That was a great pitch too.
[414:04.53]Down.
[414:05.77]Perfect throw.
[414:06.63]Cutter.
[414:09.55]Look at how bad Danny Phantom's TV show is.
[414:12.87]Even on all-star mode.
[414:14.17]Look at those stats.
[414:19.94]Ball one.
[414:27.96]Right there on the edge.
[414:29.55]That's a strike.
[414:30.95]Inside corner.
[414:31.73]Do people like Danny Phantom?
[414:36.41]I thought Danny Phantom.
[414:37.17]I thought people didn't like this show.
[414:38.59]How's that a ball?
[414:44.05]I love this show.
[414:45.99]Maybe you could use a little rest, Kurt.
[414:48.63]Oh, my God.
[414:49.11]How are these balls?
[414:49.80]Don't walk anybody.
[414:50.72]Big chop.
[415:06.45]Yes!
[415:07.37]What?
[415:10.05]You saw where I put that.
[415:12.37]Oh, come on.
[415:16.17]Alright, I got... It's two outs.
[415:17.87]Just get an out.
[415:24.79]It's as classic as Spider-Man, dude.
[415:27.04]Alright.
[415:29.60]What the fuck did you just do?
[415:30.90]Got him at third!
[415:40.48]What?
[415:40.74]What just happened?
[415:44.08]How did you miss that?
[415:45.02]Oh, now here comes the yak.
[415:46.94]Oh, this is horrible.
[415:47.84]This is not good.
[415:52.35]Someone can get that, right?
[415:53.17]No!
[415:53.49]What the fuck?
[415:53.93]Alright, I gotta lock in next step.
[416:04.11]What the hell?
[416:05.17]How do you hit that ball?
[416:06.19]I'm just in dirt.
[416:10.10]Please.
[416:13.04]It's alright.
[416:14.02]We're in the third inning.
[416:14.90]Everybody sit down and relax.
[416:16.86]Patrick's coming up right now.
[416:17.92]I swung so late.
[416:23.00]Look.
[416:27.46]He's throwing so fast.
[416:31.62]Alright, Patrick.
[416:32.14]Get us back in the game.

[417:04.96]Oh shit.
[417:11.23]No!
[417:11.81]Alright, everything's fine.
[417:14.15]It's the fourth inning.
[417:15.01]I got a lot- it's a lot of baseball left to play, alright?
[417:17.37]Almost didn't get him.
[417:32.89]Stop at the fourth.
[417:34.07]One away.
[417:40.12]Goes right back up the middle.
[417:42.18]Get him out of first base.
[417:42.82]Lee is safe at first.
[417:48.62]I can't.
[417:50.02]Runner on first.
[417:51.32]One down.
[417:54.52]Oh, my God.
[417:55.67]What happened?
[417:56.57]Hey.
[417:57.43]Ow.
[417:57.83]My chest.
[417:58.75]What happened?
[417:59.47]What the hell just happened?
[418:03.58]Ow, that hurt.
[418:04.18]Okay, hold on, I need a second.
[418:06.34]Ow, why did that happen?
[418:07.80]Ow.
[418:07.96]That just happened.
[418:14.85]Okay, I'm alright.
[418:16.57]That was just an emotion that just bursted out of me.
[418:20.11]Oh my god, it's all falling apart.
[418:24.73]Oh, great job.
[418:25.74]Fighting off a tough bitch.
[418:32.61]Shut up you fucking little weirdo I have to get a strikeout right now or it's our admin in a lot of trouble
[419:01.26]Not in time.
[419:03.10]Safe.
[419:05.00]Shit.
[419:07.46]Okay, I may as well be playing Sekiro right now.
[419:09.94]I need to fucking relax.
[419:11.94]One on, and the first pitch is a ball.
[419:20.83]Ball two.
[419:25.55]Yeah, this is going to come out of the game.
[419:27.99]He's too tired.
[419:29.24]Fastball, low and inside.
[419:39.25]She's too tired.
[419:40.17]I gotta bring somebody in.
[419:45.60]God damn it.
[419:47.42]I'm just building his meter up.
[419:48.78]Strike three.
[419:49.92]Out of place.
[420:02.38]That stupid air horn.
[420:05.46]That stupid air horn.
[420:06.82]I just... That fucking air horn.
[420:22.77]Strike out.
[420:23.31]Alright, let's get back to business here.
[420:26.85]Next up, Dan the Lion.
[420:29.91]Had a double last time up.
[420:33.15]It's alright.
[420:33.51]Let him waste his meter.
[420:34.91]It's alright.
[420:35.31]Foul ball.
[420:35.63]Stay alive.
[420:58.62]I didn't want to swing.
[420:59.46]I wanted to check swing.
[421:01.28]I tried to check swing.
[421:02.78]I tried to check swing and it didn't work.
[421:04.23]I hate this!
[421:05.17]Oh my god!
[421:06.23]It's impossible to play against!
[421:13.21]He's so good!
[421:29.33]You see how insane it is to determine if that's a ball is that's a strike or not I
[421:55.48]Don't worry, I got this
[422:16.76]Oh my god damn it.
[422:19.29]Playing against all-star.
[422:21.01]Back when, like, difficulty just means they all get, like, extra stars.
[422:25.53]The game's not harder.
[422:26.57]They just have fucking 100% more stats than I do.
[422:30.17]Strike one.
[422:43.80]What happened?
[422:44.20]No, don't restart the game.
[422:46.12]I want to take... I got to take Gaz out.
[422:49.51]Yeah, we're switching Gaz for E drives.
[422:51.39]Oh my god, he sucks.
[422:53.37]But at least he's fresh.
[422:54.03]That's low and away.
[422:56.29]Two and one.
[423:18.56]Alright.
[423:31.81]It's only the fifth inning.
[423:32.53]I'm fine.
[423:34.78]I just got to get some contact hits.
[423:37.72]It's this fucking character they have on this team.
[423:39.74]This guy's insane.
[423:44.98]Look at that hot zone.
[423:46.63]Really?
[423:52.19]Swing and a miss.
[423:53.27]Strike one.
[424:00.16]Strike two called outside corner.
[424:02.40]This is where we make him greedy.
[424:04.24]We throw a fastball up and in just out of the zone.
[424:06.24]He's going to freak out.
[424:07.24]That ball's fouled away.
[424:09.84]That ball exploded.
[424:10.64]He hit it so hard.
[424:11.32]Okay, well, new plan.
[424:18.22]That's low and away.
[424:20.04]One and two.
[424:24.25]That pitch is taken.
[424:25.37]Counts two and two.
[424:29.95]Swing at it.
[424:31.71]That one's over everybody's head and will drop in the outfield.
[424:36.55]He's done.
[424:37.29]Safe at second base.
[424:42.52]Freaking do up.
[424:43.54]This hitter is 0 for 2 on the day.
[424:46.20]Yeah.
[424:46.52]Okay.
[424:46.70]This guy sucks.
[424:48.04]I'm naked.
[424:50.14]Girl, there's no need to get upset.
[424:52.64]Put the computer down.
[424:54.73]CPU crew.
[424:56.15]It was the bullshit when I threw the ball into the outfield.
[424:58.83]That was when it just went into a total meltdown.
[425:01.80]Nice pitch!
[425:03.44]Gaz turned around.
[425:04.18]I went to go pick the guy off, and she just threw the ball into the sands.
[425:07.22]Like, what was that all about?
[425:08.40]Here's the 0-2 pitch.
[425:15.26]Red Hulk is stepping up.
[425:17.81]Player on second, two away.
[425:23.85]I don't think Ren swings the bat, by the way.
[425:26.77]I don't think I've seen him swing the bat.
[425:31.07]Stop screaming.
[425:32.83]I have homework to do.
[425:33.81]Fuck.
[425:34.27]Okay.
[425:34.75]He doesn't have a lot of power, though.
[425:36.79]I kind of... What do I... Should I... It's Ren.
[425:46.36]We're fine.
[425:50.06]Where are you getting this from?
[425:59.07]Come on.
[425:59.67]I'm just giving them free meter.
[426:01.11]Because they don't swing the goddamn bat.
[426:03.59]Okay.
[426:05.15]I need to get a couple people on base.
[426:16.68]I'm not swinging.
[426:20.12]That goes across the whole zone.
[426:31.98]Let's take it.
[426:33.56]It's in there.
[426:38.43]It's not fair.
[426:38.79]Stop!
[426:41.33]Stop!
[426:41.91]I feel like I'm watching a Donald Trump meme video.
[427:01.87]That's right down the middle.
[427:03.63]Stay at first.
[427:04.89]Stay at first.
[427:05.95]Alright.
[427:06.33]Patrick's coming up.
[427:07.76]I'm going to get a home run right here.
[427:09.00]Bang.
[427:09.12]First pitch.
[427:09.50]Home run.
[427:10.00]I got it.
[427:34.50]Back in the game.
[427:38.12]Seven to four.
[427:38.82]Game ain't over.
[427:41.23]Alright.
[427:48.33]Now take him out.
[427:50.15]Bench him.
[427:50.73]Game's not over.
[427:51.19]No, it's not.
[427:51.75]Not even close.
[427:52.61]Breaking ball called.
[427:54.03]Ball one.
[428:04.11]I'm not swinging until I get a strike.
[428:06.03]That was the... Okay, fine.
[428:09.59]You want to play that?
[428:10.79]Just throw it.
[428:13.01]I don't even care.
[428:15.85]Dude, burn all your meter.
[428:17.00]I don't care.
[428:17.34]You won't have it next inning.
[428:18.04]It has to throw a strike.
[428:20.20]Oh, my God.
[428:34.12]Jeff is a mess.
[428:35.68]Jeff is a big fat mistake.
[428:40.84]I hate that.
[428:41.44]Get that off.
[428:42.04]I don't want to hear that.
[428:42.72]I'm going to keep thinking of those videos.
[428:45.72]Oh my god.
[428:55.22]It was right down the middle.
[428:56.12]I thought it was going out to the right side of the zone.
[429:01.10]Oh my god.
[429:02.30]Alright, it's okay.
[429:08.68]I can't... I can't pick another pitcher?
[429:16.65]Um... Alright, your power is pretty shitty.
[429:25.51]I'm going curveball down and in.
[429:26.74]He's gonna miss.
[429:29.87]Shit, of course.
[429:31.31]I got fucking Powder Toast Man throwing these like monster curveballs that when I do this, I can't hit it.
[429:38.22]Ugh, that sucks.
[429:39.52]I gotta get three guys on base and hit Grand Slam.
[429:57.26]Nice and easy, Chum Chum.
[430:06.48]That's an easy play.
[430:09.26]You should have picked a better pitcher than me.
[430:13.28]No, I should have picked the Yak.
[430:14.92]What was I thinking?
[430:16.56]What was I thinking?
[430:18.08]I should have picked the Yak.
[430:20.41]That one's over everybody's head and will drop in the outfield.
[430:24.51]I just used my whole meter.
[430:25.67]What happened?
[430:26.21]My meter's all gone.
[430:29.87]What happened?
[430:30.47]Wait, that uses the whole meter?
[430:33.01]What happened?
[430:34.37]Wait, why is the meter gone?
[430:35.43]I was saving that.
[430:36.79]Turbo uses the actual turbo, but I didn't know that.
[430:44.27]Builder's running hard.
[430:47.54]Not in time.
[430:49.26]Runner's safe.
[430:50.46]I thought that was how to get a dive.
[430:53.36]If you hit a home run.
[430:54.38]The computer has so much ridiculous stats on all star mode.
[431:09.43]It's just what the fuck.
[431:10.71]It is not even possible.
[431:12.05]I'm not coming back from this bullshit.
[431:17.39]This is impossible.
[431:31.17]I'm not quitting.
[431:32.19]I'm not quitting.
[431:34.81]I picked a shit team.
[431:35.89]I'm doubling down after this.
[431:38.39]I'm picking the dream team.
[431:53.53]Painting the corners there.
[431:54.83]That's a strike.
[432:01.89]Open the corner right here.
[432:03.63]Oh my god.
[432:28.86]Can I quit and just take the 500 million?
[432:31.10]What the fuck, dude?
[432:33.54]Why?
[432:34.04]I can't even... This is an absolute blowout now.
[432:35.94]And why do they hit a home run every fucking single at bat?
[432:52.15]What the fuck are you talking about?
[432:58.11]Such holy shit.
[433:08.44]That's fucking stupid.
[433:10.06]Oh, even Ren from Ren and Goddamn Stimpy is going to hit a home run?
[433:14.76]Is he going to go around the whole thing?
[433:19.92]Hey, there's still plenty of baseball left, don't worry.
[433:45.37]What the fuck?
[433:51.98]This is a close game.
[433:53.86]It's 15 to 4.
[434:00.02]What happened?
[434:01.14]Why does everybody have to hit home run every at bat?
[434:04.37]Is it because this pitcher, I brought this pitcher in and he sucks?
[434:07.67]What happened?
[434:10.51]Sends it down the line and that ball is fair.
[434:16.91]Why?
[434:17.69]It's not over yet.
[434:18.73]I could still come back and win this.
[434:23.79]Okay, that's how you get the juices flowing again.
[434:26.51]Catch like that.
[434:26.91]Let's go.
[434:27.21]Here it comes.
[434:27.65]Don't swing until you get a strike.
[434:29.11]That shit goes 67 miles per hour.
[434:50.66]This pitch is just so slow.
[434:52.08]This pitch is just so slow.
[434:54.63]It's impossible.
[434:56.21]I got to pick Powder Toast Man.
[435:07.61]If I'm going to double down, I got to pick Powder Toast Man first.
[435:10.65]This guy goes from like 95 to 65.
[435:12.70]Whipped a bird.
[435:19.49]Still got thrown out.
[435:20.57]No, he didn't.
[435:26.21]Okay, I'm good.
[435:27.27]Finally, he's out of the game.
[435:30.33]Oh my god!
[435:31.15]Damn it!
[435:34.30]I quit.
[435:36.48]I'll take the loss.
[435:38.16]I lose.
[435:38.62]That's 500 million.
[435:41.06]I'm literally just calling the team back.
[435:43.36]Call the team back.
[435:47.32]Slaughter rule.
[435:47.80]Game's over.
[435:52.11]Double or nothing.
[435:52.61]This is for a billion.
[435:55.67]I'm going to the Boppers.
[435:58.70]Gotta get Powder Toast Man off.
[436:14.65]I'm going Yak.
[436:17.12]Yak pitcher.
[436:17.86]Don't take Powder Toastman.
[436:19.48]First baseman.
[436:21.44]I'm getting Powder Toastman the fuck off of this goddamn list.
[436:27.30]SpongeBob's pitching.
[436:28.18]Alright.
[436:29.92]Locked in my two favorite players.
[436:36.46]Tough was good.
[436:40.48]Going tough.
[436:43.00]No.
[436:43.95]No, I refuse to pick.
[436:44.91]I don't want Daddy Phantom.
[436:54.54]Sandy.
[436:59.02]Getting a wild card in there.
[437:06.39]Flying Dutchman.
[437:06.93]Let's go.
[437:15.34]I'm going for a total wild card here.
[437:18.99]Is it for a billion added or a billion off?
[437:21.57]And I'm done after this.
[437:22.87]This is the real one.
[437:23.60]Good start.
[437:24.90]Really good start.
[437:27.52]Now we slow it down and go out of the strike zone.
[437:50.85]That's a strike.
[437:51.55]That's on the corner.
[437:55.61]Yak is unbelievable.
[438:25.69]Nobody can hit this.
[438:33.32]97 miles per hour.
[438:35.76]I got to get a strikeout.
[438:36.40]Let's do slider.
[438:37.04]I'm going to do split fastball.
[438:39.56]Down where he likes it.
[438:41.92]Then entice him to swing in this.
[438:45.74]He's just got this massive brain.
[438:49.97]What the hell is this?
[438:51.57]I am so on this.
[438:56.26]I thought that was olive oil for a second from Popeye.
[438:58.28]I was like, that's not Nickelodeon.
[439:08.02]Zipped in for strike one.
[439:15.23]Strike two.
[439:16.27]Count is one and one.
[439:21.58]Again.
[439:23.12]Can't hit the fast stuff.
[439:23.96]We're going to split it down.
[439:24.80]Out of the strike zone.
[439:25.64]Swing and a miss.
[439:27.62]Oh, he's injured.
[439:33.58]Can they get injured?
[439:35.99]Alright, you can't.
[439:39.99]They're going to get a hit.
[439:43.13]It's alright.
[439:44.25]There's two outs.
[439:45.03]It's fine.
[439:49.90]There it is.
[440:07.13]Sandy Cheeks.
[440:07.73]What a fucking... What happened?
[440:09.07]Did I get him?
[440:09.53]Okay, yeah, I got him.
[440:11.28]That was a beautiful play by Sandy.
[440:12.44]That's why you have Sandy at third base every time.
[440:17.93]Powdered Toastman lead us off with a nice single.
[440:24.95]No, don't go for two.
[440:26.03]Don't be stupid.
[440:27.77]And this guy has terrible stats.
[440:28.88]Don't throw.
[440:29.32]No double play.
[440:29.76]No double play.
[440:30.28]Thank God.
[440:47.08]SpongeBob, it's kind of hard to... He's got the rainbow trail.
[440:50.66]It's really important.
[440:51.78]It's kind of hard to see.
[440:56.15]Oh, my God.
[441:01.21]It's hard to see his pitch.
[441:05.33]Shit.
[441:06.13]Let's take it.
[441:09.15]100 miles per hour.
[441:19.61]What the fuck?
[441:21.27]97?
[441:21.87]It's in there!
[441:28.81]How is SpongeBob throwing faster than the yak?
[441:33.01]Not gonna chase that low.
[441:34.92]One in one count.
[441:55.81]Get it in.
[441:56.17]It's alright.
[441:56.45]Turn double play.
[441:58.07]I'm going to go with sinking balls down the middle of the zone.
[442:00.95]Alright, we're going to do split finger.
[442:05.53]Turn this double play.
[442:06.53]This guy sucks.
[442:07.73]Not even a Nicktoon.
[442:08.57]Get out of here.
[442:11.19]Not even a Nicktoon.
[442:20.64]There it is.
[442:21.98]There it is.
[442:22.74]Nice job, Toph.
[442:24.22]Danny Phantom's fast.
[442:28.40]Go for two.
[442:29.52]Go for second base.
[442:30.74]Don't try to get a double play.
[442:36.25]Can we get Gurr out of here?
[442:40.79]Like, how do I just remove Gurr from the game?
[442:46.41]Alright, now I can play around a little bit here.
[442:51.11]Going right down here with a split.
[442:57.18]That was so good.
[442:59.74]Oh, that was so close.
[443:02.57]Okay.
[443:03.23]I gotta get a strikeout.
[443:30.30]Not gonna let you fuck with me on that one, buddy.
[443:32.42]Split her out of the zone.
[443:39.34]Swing this one.
[443:39.92]Alright, alright, whatever.
[443:43.04]Oh, hold on a minute!
[444:00.63]Hold on.
[444:01.19]I- wait.
[444:33.03]Oh my god.
[444:33.85]What the fuck did that happen?
[444:40.93]That was so stupid.
[444:44.33]Who's the catcher?
[444:48.65]Oh my god, that sucks.
[444:52.65]What the fuck?
[444:57.13]It's cartoon baseball.
[444:58.11]Yeah, nobody punched it.
[444:59.13]Nobody attacked anybody.
[445:03.47]Okay, I have to... I need to relax.
[445:09.29]I gotta relax.
[445:11.85]That was so stupid.
[445:14.82]That motherfucker is out.
[445:15.84]Strike three, come on.
[445:17.90]Don't do it.
[445:22.08]Oh, shit.
[445:37.81]Patrick.
[445:38.07]That's a strike.
[445:38.83]Strike.
[446:07.84]Oh, okay.
[446:08.76]Strike two.
[446:10.36]Up and in.
[446:10.78]Fastball.
[446:11.30]Perfect throw.
[446:11.74]Let's go.
[446:12.76]Bingo.
[446:13.28]Oh.
[446:13.40]Alright.
[446:16.06]It's only one run.
[446:16.69]I'm fine.
[446:20.17]Don't swing until you get a strike.
[446:23.51]That's what we did in Little League.
[446:28.74]Wait a minute.
[446:31.14]Did you see that?
[446:31.90]If you throw in their hot zone, you get turbo if they miss.
[446:37.74]Did you see that shit?
[446:41.86]Don't risk it.
[446:43.72]Alright, that's it.
[446:44.68]I want to advance the runner.
[446:45.56]Flying Dutchman.
[446:47.56]This is it.
[446:47.94]Who dares pitch to the flag?
[447:06.19]That's right down the middle.
[447:06.99]That's a hole.
[447:13.82]No, it's not.
[447:15.52]Stay back.
[447:17.30]Don't swing.
[447:19.24]Oh, God.
[447:24.90]Oh, my goodness.
[447:30.45]You got to be fucking kidding me.
[447:31.59]I swung at the perfect time.
[447:34.79]Flick is up next.
[447:36.51]Players on first and third, two away.
[447:39.40]Oh my god, it goes fucking 60 miles per hour!
[447:44.46]Finds the hole in left.
[447:45.96]Tie game.
[447:47.02]Topspin down!
[447:49.58]What are you doing?
[447:51.58]Why would you run for third?
[447:52.88]I didn't tell you to do that.
[447:53.96]You didn't even slide, you fucking ghost imbecile.
[447:57.84]What an idiot.
[447:59.18]I didn't tell him to do that, and he didn't even slide.
[448:01.14]I was smashing A.
[448:05.84]I get turbo for that.
[448:43.12]top of the third one away challenge it's alright is he even trying it's a one-to-one game on I'm playing the hardest difficulty what are you talking about called for a ball now it's one and one kicks and fires

[449:12.43]Alright.
[449:15.15]One out.
[449:15.45]We have some more returns on play.
[449:16.81]We're going to go double play time.
[449:24.64]Fires.
[449:25.20]Ignoring the runner.
[449:26.00]That's strike one.
[449:28.74]Ignoring the runner.
[449:29.85]How do I throw?
[449:32.55]Hitter tries to catch the runner at first.
[449:43.39]That's a strike.
[449:50.81]It's right in the zone.
[449:52.17]What are you talking about?
[450:12.62]I cannot let them do that no way back up the middle it goes fuck you no he's gonna get meter it's two to one whiff is coming up runners on first and third one away powder toast man you suck zim is rounding second
[450:41.36]How come, like, SpongeBob will jump 40 feet in the air and catch that ball?
[450:45.52]I'm going to ignore that.
[450:46.64]Hello, Mr. Playsticker.
[450:48.54]They dive across the whole game.
[450:49.86]He just did a Daria.
[450:54.33]Ah, whoops.
[450:55.29]Why does he not launch across the whole game?
[450:58.07]Like the SpongeBob guy does.
[451:03.73]Big fly ball.
[451:04.89]Hit to right.
[451:10.46]Stupid motherfucking game.
[451:13.02]I can't believe it.
[451:14.18]Why does it have to keep happening?
[451:17.27]Why?
[451:18.05]It's not fair.
[451:18.75]Frozen Robe hit to the outfield.
[451:24.11]Fires it in.
[451:27.17]Okay, after like the third inning, they just start hitting every single ball.
[451:33.19]Ease all is due up.
[451:34.65]Runner on second.
[451:35.75]Two away.
[451:44.42]It ain't over yet.
[451:45.00]Just don't let it get out of control.
[451:48.21]Okay, here we go.
[451:54.51]I need base runners.
[451:55.57]I'm not swinging until I get a strike.
[452:17.35]That's turbo times three.
[452:19.31]Let him walk me in four pitches.
[452:22.09]Oh, my God.
[452:22.88]I knew what I was doing, too.
[452:24.38]Why would you swing?
[452:25.18]I was about to scream in the microphone.
[452:36.79]Where are you getting this from?
[452:45.61]Come on.
[452:46.15]Fill up that meter.
[452:46.97]I need it.
[452:47.39]That was a foul ball.
[452:51.77]That was perfect.
[452:56.23]Give me something to hit.
[452:59.66]Look at that little rinky-dink bullshit hit.
[453:02.68]That was terrible.
[453:26.05]I got to string something together.
[453:27.41]I got to get people on base.
[453:30.29]One, two.
[453:34.29]One, two count.
[453:35.17]Oh, man.
[453:39.29]This is the best day ever.
[453:43.27]Stepping in for the third time, Patrick Star.
[453:46.25]Fuck.
[453:46.71]This player is 0 for 2.
[453:48.87]Four runs is okay.
[453:50.01]I can deal with four runs.
[453:52.35]Should be an easy play in right.
[453:55.08]1-2-3 inning.
[453:55.32]1-2-3.
[453:55.40]1-2-3.
[453:55.46]1-2-3.
[453:55.56]I got it.
[453:55.84]I'm good.
[453:56.12]That's a strike.
[453:56.82]Give me a break.
[453:57.98]I got to fill up that meter and I'll string together five hits.
[454:21.00]Whoa!
[454:22.54]Oh, that runner's out by a mile.
[454:24.80]Alright, come on.
[454:26.42]Kitty Caswell!
[454:28.24]I can do this.
[454:32.52]I thought that was a home run.
[454:33.28]I was like, no way.
[454:37.58]Here comes the pitch.
[454:39.55]Taken for a ball.
[454:41.47]The computer is stupid.
[454:42.85]Nobody takes that.
[454:43.63]If I'm playing against another person, they're swinging.
[454:48.13]Takes for strike two.
[455:02.73]That was scary, but I got it.
[455:05.47]I got three meters right now.
[455:09.51]Down by four runs.
[455:11.71]Just let him throw it.
[455:12.74]Don't even swing.
[455:14.76]Let him waste it.
[455:16.48]I got almost four of these damn things.
[455:18.26]Don't swing.
[455:20.08]Do not swing until I get a strike.
[455:26.65]Don't do it.
[455:28.70]Don't swing.
[455:30.10]Under any circumstance.
[455:31.48]Walk.
[455:31.84]Alright.
[455:32.08]I got somebody on base and I have four charges.
[455:41.50]Let's go.
[455:41.80]Oh my god.
[455:42.08]If you hit into a double play, I will scream.
[455:43.64]Thank god.
[455:57.42]Alright, don't swing until I get a strike.
[456:10.13]That's down the line!
[456:12.99]Alright, alright, alright.
[456:14.13]Dude, here we go.
[456:15.87]I can get to one- I can make it a one-run game.
[456:19.30]Flying Dutchman.
[456:20.94]There it is.
[456:26.58]The one-run game.
[456:31.05]5 to 4.
[456:31.51]I got this.
[456:32.12]I can do this.
[456:34.36]I still got meter too.
[456:38.18]Yes.
[456:38.62]Alright, we're back in this.
[456:42.46]I'll swing until I get a strike.
[456:44.22]I need base runners again.
[456:51.87]That's okay.
[456:54.17]I'm about to take the lead.
[456:56.55]I gotta get it done right.
[456:59.64]I don't even know who the fuck you are, but you're hitting a home run.
[457:04.04]I win.
[457:10.55]Six.
[457:10.87]I just took the leap.
[457:12.29]Six, four.
[457:13.01]Six, five.
[457:13.41]Let's go.
[457:23.02]And Powder Toast Man coming up.
[457:25.91]His contacts are the best in the whole game.
[457:28.23]Don't swing.
[457:34.71]That's going to be a tricky play no matter who you are.
[457:37.45]Whatever.
[457:42.74]That sounded way more powerful than it was.
[457:48.64]Alright.
[457:49.62]We made some good progress here.
[457:53.96]Don't blow it.
[458:04.17]Stay strong.
[458:04.97]I am.
[458:05.89]I think I got this.
[458:06.51]I just have to play smart.
[458:11.29]Already in the hole.
[458:11.99]Strike three.
[458:18.85]Oh.
[458:19.55]One and two.
[458:24.77]Get him!
[458:25.41]Sorry.
[458:25.61]Stupid air horn.
[458:56.66]Zim is there in time and has a base hit.
[459:00.16]Are we there yet?
[459:00.98]Sure, there's no need to get upset.
[459:03.00]Put the computer down and let's get back to the game.
[459:06.29]I want to throw a third.
[459:07.07]Look, he's halfway down the baseline.
[459:09.33]I want to throw a third base.
[459:12.55]Why can't I throw the third base?
[459:14.65]Look at him.
[459:17.99]I can't throw the third base.
[459:32.91]I can't... Where's my... I can't throw to their base?
[459:34.43]Oh, God.
[459:35.07]Thank goodness.
[459:35.97]Yes!
[459:36.23]Double play.
[459:47.02]Sit down.
[460:02.46]Oh, shit.
[460:03.36]Zipped in for strike two.
[460:05.14]Are you perfects in a row?
[460:08.83]I have to.
[460:31.16]That's good enough for me.
[460:32.28]Alright.
[460:32.60]This is it.
[460:33.36]That's what I'm pitching out of a jam.
[460:35.36]That's what I like to say.
[460:42.91]It's not a ball.
[460:44.03]Another pitch.
[461:01.11]Strike him up.
[461:01.69]Right here.
[461:02.01]This is it.
[461:03.41]Same place.
[461:04.05]Up and in.
[461:04.59]Challenge him.
[461:07.73]That's a strike.
[461:09.01]I'm going for it.
[461:17.13]I have to.
[461:17.55]I need to secure the strikeout.
[461:26.48]That was a strategic place to do that.
[461:30.37]He gets a base hit.
[461:31.03]It's tie game.
[461:31.35]Don't say that.
[461:31.77]66 mile per hour.
[461:32.09]Goddamn changeup.
[461:33.25]Alright.
[461:33.53]He's going to throw two balls in a row.
[461:36.82]I think.
[462:01.38]Oh, they, they, whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[462:11.60]What is, excuse me?
[462:13.82]Who's this random guy that has all, everything is maxed?
[462:18.26]Who the fuck is this person?
[462:19.96]What?
[462:25.43]Let's get back to the game.
[462:31.24]Whatever.
[462:31.60]Are you serious?
[462:33.50]Alright, I just gotta- I almost have a meter.
[462:36.10]Oh my god!
[462:41.85]The arc on that cur- MVP right here.
[462:51.69]That's a comfortable lead.
[462:57.50]Okay, I can't lose.
[462:58.52]I got... They scored like 15 runs in one inning.
[463:02.08]I have to be very careful.
[463:05.72]Don't get confident.
[463:09.02]Oh, just hold off.
[463:15.54]Alright, just let him throw it in the dirt.
[463:21.42]I don't care.
[463:28.70]What a waste of turbo.
[463:31.10]Must be all-star.
[463:32.12]Just take the next pitch.
[463:34.58]Whatever.
[463:34.84]That's alright.
[463:39.10]Holy shit.
[463:39.84]That's so slow.
[463:41.75]That's so slow.
[463:43.03]Flying Dutchman.
[463:44.21]Flying Dutchman.
[463:53.99]Wow.
[463:55.67]Are you kidding me?
[463:58.21]That's huge.
[463:59.21]If I take a couple of balls, I might get another home run.
[464:07.56]Give me a meter.
[464:08.84]Come on.
[464:09.54]Throw another ball out of the dirt.
[464:12.38]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[464:16.60]Oh, fuck you.
[464:17.68]That was out of the strike zone.
[464:18.80]Whatever.
[464:21.87]I don't get that call.
[464:22.83]Okay.
[464:22.93]I think I got to pull out.
[464:24.19]I think I got to pull them.
[464:26.51]Oh, shit.
[464:50.12]He actually missed.
[464:51.56]He actually missed.
[464:52.40]Get that ball.
[464:58.76]That's okay.
[465:04.50]We're going home if it's a ground ball.
[465:09.74]Keep that in mind.
[465:21.11]Round ball, we go home.
[465:30.19]Flying Dutchman, what in the name of God did you just do that for?
[465:45.06]It was in front of you.
[465:46.84]It's right in front of you.
[465:49.15]Oh my god, swing it then.
[465:50.03]Get him!
[465:50.45]Okay, we're good.
[465:51.07]Everything's fine.
[466:21.17]He's got to come out next inning.
[466:22.23]He cannot pitch in the seventh inning.
[466:38.52]There it is.
[466:39.20]Alright.
[466:40.48]Strike him out.
[466:45.79]Well, thank you.
[466:53.46]I think I got to pull him.
[466:56.29]I got to pull him, I think.
[466:58.59]One more batter.
[467:02.41]He's out.
[467:07.71]Coming in for the mobbers, ScottDogKnight.
[467:22.43]Shit!
[467:27.64]Oh no!
[467:29.26]It's... No!
[467:30.58]What the fuck?
[467:43.08]Oh my god, this pitcher sucks so much.
[467:46.80]They're gonna hit every single ball.
[467:49.63]They're gonna hit every single ball.
[467:52.51]He's terrible.
[467:53.85]I don't get six stars in every single category.
[467:59.83]How are you supposed to do a nine-inning game in Nicktoons MLB versus All-Star team?
[468:06.59]He doesn't come in with five stars in every category.
[468:19.23]Easy play, Dutchman.
[468:20.29]Come on.
[468:21.13]Alright, that's it.
[468:23.03]I can do this.
[468:25.39]I can do this.
[468:26.01]Alright, here we go.
[468:27.11]This pitch is better than SpongeBob.
[468:29.17]How the fuck is this fair?
[468:30.80]Come on.
[468:31.64]Fuck you.
[468:48.82]He went right into the hot zone.
[468:50.54]Of course he did.
[468:51.34]I got to get somebody on base.
[468:52.48]Powder Toastman, it's got to be you.
[468:55.18]Oh, fuck.
[468:57.70]Join us next time.
[469:17.88]Beat it out.
[469:19.08]Beat it out.
[469:19.50]Beat it out.
[469:21.80]Beat it out.
[469:22.22]Beat it out.
[469:22.62]Beat it out.
[469:23.02]Beat it out.
[469:23.42]Beat it out.
[469:23.80]Oh, god damn it.
[469:24.56]They're going to hit everything.
[469:26.30]I shouldn't have pulled it.
[469:27.92]Even though the LDX sucks.
[469:29.42]I don't think I should have pulled him.
[469:50.75]Alright, that's good.
[469:52.19]You better catch that.
[469:54.50]Star is due up.
[470:02.16]Last is one to deep left center.
[470:05.97]It's 11 day.
[470:08.35]Knuckler is up next.
[470:09.91]This player is one for four on the day.
[470:15.84]They're going to hit everything.
[470:19.30]Why?
[470:19.38]It sucks.
[470:20.06]It's not out of reach.
[470:21.38]I can still do it.
[470:24.06]It's only a three-run game.
[470:25.78]We're good.
[470:27.08]Everybody relax.
[470:50.36]This is like... They just have... It's not possible to play a nine inning game in this game against an all-star team.
[471:05.39]They're going to hit fucking home runs every other at-bat.
[471:11.56]I can't even pull this pitcher.
[471:12.88]You only get two.
[471:13.62]What?
[471:15.00]What?
[471:20.91]I can't even pull this guy.
[471:22.65]God damn it.
[471:41.15]I was up too.
[471:42.06]And I had to switch my pitchers because you have to.
[471:45.26]And now they're just going to get in fucking great contact with every single at-bat.
[471:52.34]Here's how Jerma can still win.
[471:53.78]That's not even a ball.
[471:57.60]He gets those calls.
[471:58.78]That's unfair.
[472:01.90]He gets those fucking calls.
[472:04.57]Where are you getting this from?
[472:08.53]Zim is a perfect five for five.
[472:11.93]Wimp is stepping up.
[472:13.29]Players on first and second, one away.
[472:18.19]Oh, right one.
[472:21.54]I need five runs.
[472:22.70]I need so much more power.
[472:33.84]Somebody fucking strangle that little guy.
[472:36.25]Turn it.
[472:36.69]Alright, that's how you do it.
[472:38.23]Let's go.
[472:38.59]Oh, boy.
[472:38.99]Down to first base for a routine double play.
[472:51.83]And they have this guy.
[472:53.27]How is this any fucking fair?
[473:03.92]Why does this guy have max stats?
[473:09.59]SpongeBob didn't even have max stats.
[473:16.51]Despite the great throw, that one's safe.
[473:21.24]Alright.
[473:21.84]Here we go.
[473:31.73]Alright.
[473:33.01]Alright.
[473:33.33]Everybody relax.
[473:34.15]We got three men on base.
[473:35.46]I got one out.
[473:36.98]This guy has no... Okay.
[473:41.90]Alright.
[473:42.12]This is it.
[473:43.30]No not swing until I get a strike.
[473:46.40]I'm going to get power and I'm going to fucking bring this back.
[474:01.90]What just fucking happened?
[474:03.79]The game is broken.
[474:05.69]This is a broken video game.
[474:07.53]This is a broken video game.
[474:09.05]That was a double fucking play?
[474:11.55]This is a video game.
[474:12.33]You're not supposed to win.
[474:12.87]It's impossible to win on the All-Star.
[474:16.08]What?
[474:16.22]I don't understand what happened.
[474:19.71]She lagged for a second and instantly teleported to the ball.
[474:23.91]And then apparently tagged the guy out at third base.
[474:30.46]That'll get to the corner.
[474:35.12]It hit the runner.
[474:36.22]No, she caught it.
[474:37.68]She caught the dumb... Whoa.
[474:40.26]Strike one.
[474:48.55]Zipped in for strike two.
[474:58.25]You suck, Dutchman.
[475:02.74]Corners is now two for five on the day.
[475:06.40]Top of the eighth.
[475:07.36]One away.
[475:13.14]Cowball.
[475:19.31]that's not a ball and I know it runners all over just get the sure out don't do anything stupid I could have gone I couldn't do that a two to six to one double play whatever it was he's gonna activate his power too isn't he
[475:45.35]I have to, he has to hit the ball.
[475:46.77]Let him hit it.
[475:48.09]No, let him hit the ball.
[475:49.27]Hit it.
[475:49.99]Don't activate your power before, I'm going to do it before he can fucking do anything.
[475:55.05]Don't let him activate the power, just pitch right away.
[476:01.19]It's blasted to deep center right.
[476:07.26]No, why?
[476:09.26]I didn't want him to activate the power.
[476:12.92]No.
[476:28.68]It's over.
[476:29.39]Oh, come on.
[476:30.67]Oh, you brought in a different pitcher.
[476:33.45]Ah, the game's fucking impossible.
[476:35.03]You brought a new pitcher in.
[476:36.05]Game's not fucking completable.
[476:39.41]Oh, our pitcher we brought in.
[476:40.99]Oh, no, no, no.
[476:41.61]Don't worry.
[476:42.11]Our pitcher we brought in has five out of five on Yelp in fucking possible restaurant score.
[476:48.27]And he's not even a cartoon character.
[476:50.61]Isn't that something?
[476:54.99]Swings for strike two.
[476:59.75]That's nice.
[477:01.05]Let's get back to the action.
[477:05.17]Another single.
[477:06.30]They're on for the fourth time this afternoon.
[477:08.74]Bring in a five or five, five or five pitcher.
[477:11.18]Whoa.
[477:13.38]Wowee.
[477:16.06]Do you get a five?
[477:17.10]No, you don't.
[477:17.84]Your guy has like three stars and everything.
[477:19.60]He's terrible at everything.
[477:23.84]Four.
[477:24.22]It's not even...
[477:27.08]Where are you getting this from?
[477:30.32]Okay.
[477:30.92]The blind Dutchman is having a huge game tonight.
[477:34.13]This one is three for three.
[477:40.85]Pump says ball.
[477:42.67]One and one.
[477:46.03]Picked up by Catswell.
[477:48.28]Not in time.
[477:49.94]Runners safe.
[477:51.32]Beat that shit out, Dutchman.
[477:53.02]Bottom of the eighth.
[477:54.46]Runner on first.
[477:55.46]Nobody out.
[477:57.45]Don't fall for it.
[478:03.22]Don't even swing.
[478:04.56]Look at this turbo.
[478:07.34]Let's fucking go.
[478:07.98]Come on.
[478:08.30]Let's go.
[478:09.20]Go ahead.
[478:09.38]Throw it.
[478:11.22]I don't care.
[478:11.60]Waste it.
[478:25.56]This is the bottom of the 8th inning.
[478:26.90]This is where magic happens.
[478:27.98]Everybody get the fuck back to their bases.
[478:33.16]That's so impossible.
[478:57.99]Okay.
[478:58.77]I can... Alright, that's three runs.
[479:06.64]What's the score?
[479:10.28]This ain't over.
[479:10.88]I'm not done.
[479:15.71]Four runs.
[479:17.19]Let's go.
[479:17.81]Get three people on base.
[479:21.23]Come on, Sandy.
[479:22.55]Okay.
[479:31.73]Okay.
[479:35.43]I got plenty of meter.
[479:36.17]It's a whole nother inning.
[479:38.97]And that'll do it for this inning.
[479:40.69]Three runs, two hits.
[479:43.96]Silly girl.
[479:45.24]Silly, silly girl.
[479:51.16]Finds the hole in, and right.
[479:53.32]Throw him out at first base.
[479:54.84]Yes!
[479:55.16]Bang, bang, play!
[479:56.56]This is more exciting than real baseball.
[479:59.15]Top of the ninth.
[480:00.21]One down.
[480:08.42]Right to pot.
[480:08.90]Just walk it over there.
[480:10.72]Alright.
[480:11.20]I can get four runs.
[480:12.52]Look at my meter.
[480:13.28]I got two and a half meter.
[480:14.12]Alright.
[480:14.58]Let's go.
[480:14.94]Let's do it.
[480:15.26]I gotberger.
[480:19.96]I got to get three men on base.
[480:21.20]This is not even...
[480:41.02]Oh my god, this slider is unbelievably, it's unbelievably horrible.
[480:49.49]The pitch is just so good.
[480:54.97]It's like insane.
[481:03.67]You can't determine where the fuck that ball's going.
[481:06.81]Not a million years.
[481:07.83]Look at that shit.
[481:09.25]2-2 pitch.
[481:11.34]Matter stays a lot.
[481:33.32]It's like playing fucking wiffle ball.
[481:36.40]Dude, that is not possible to know where that's going.
[481:47.47]Get on base.
[481:52.90]We've done crazier shit with fucking two outs before, haven't we?
[481:56.06]Get them on
[482:00.77]We've done crazy shit with two outs before.
[482:03.35]Let's go.
[482:03.99]Alright, let's go.
[482:08.41]Back to back.
[482:08.89]Oh!
[482:39.42]Again, one more.
[482:40.36]It's a tie game.
[482:41.46]This is it.
[482:41.84]Oh, it's a tie ball game.
[482:43.12]Yeah, kick that dirt.
[483:13.09]And we got Powder Toast Man coming up.
[483:14.73]Oh, here we go.
[483:15.97]Oh, I'm on fire.
[483:16.45]Come on.
[483:17.09]Turbo?
[483:17.57]Take another ball.
[483:18.83]Oh!
[483:18.93]Oh!
[483:48.03]No!
[483:53.97]No!
[483:57.19]It's not over.
[483:58.03]I got another at bat.
[484:01.55]It's not over.
[484:02.88]It's not over.
[484:03.82]Fall 1.
[484:16.42]Fucking, I can't, he's so bad at pitching.
[484:22.64]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[484:25.02]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[484:26.80]Why?
[484:27.58]What the fuck?
[484:28.54]He's so bad.
[484:30.56]Oh, come on.
[484:31.70]That's so stupid.
[484:38.40]This game sucks.
[484:40.54]This game fucking sucks.
[484:43.02]It's awful.
[484:44.28]It's awful.
[484:45.16]It's awful.
[484:53.30]Give me a break you motherfucker.
[484:55.50]What happened?
[485:03.49]I'm not done.
[485:04.05]Let's go.
[485:07.09]Oh, that was such horse shit.
[485:17.87]They're just hitting every fucking ball.
[485:21.21]It's insane.
[485:22.99]It's insane that they can do this.
[485:25.23]Back-to-back home runs on fucking contact swings.
[485:28.93]I gotta get a double play right now.
[485:36.21]Do not.
[485:38.77]Let him on base.
[485:41.13]Oh my god!
[485:42.91]It's unraveling.
[485:47.81]Fucking unraveling.
[485:50.09]This game sucks.
[485:51.75]This game sucks.
[485:54.60]What a piece of shit game.
[485:56.28]I'm so mad.
[485:57.18]The fucking CPU gets extra goddamn power.
[486:04.28]Inside corner.
[486:17.62]I was gonna win the game too, but this fucking CPU!
[486:22.02]Bullshit!
[486:23.54]They all get maximum stats!
[486:26.20]Who made this game?
[486:27.98]How dare you!
[486:31.17]I can't even change this pitcher out and I can't throw a fucking strike even if I put it in the middle of the zone!
[486:36.57]Can't catch up with the four-seamer.
[486:42.15]That was not where I put that fucking ball.
[486:43.96]This guy sucks absolute asshole.
[486:46.16]That's not even where I put that pitch.
[486:51.64]Taken for a ball.
[487:04.19]Full count at three and two.
[487:12.76]game that's such bullshit I had it with powder toast me but the guy I gotta throw ball it's gonna start at the top of the fucking screen and it's gonna end up at the bottom of the screen isn't that fun
[487:41.09]I don't make that catcher.
[487:42.61]I can't make that catcher.
[487:43.51]The computer will.
[487:44.31]Have I... You know what I'm going to say.
[487:48.99]How is that not a strike for me, but it's a strike for him?
[488:20.44]is dog shit.
[488:25.10]Look, my pitcher is so tired.
[488:27.32]They're just going to string together a million fucking hits.
[488:30.26]I can't even do anything.
[488:33.57]Who is the fucking moron that thought that you shouldn't be able to switch out more than one pitcher in the whole game?
[488:40.89]And listen to my voice going like this.
[488:42.33]How could you be so stupid?
[488:45.38]Why can you only switch one pitcher in nine innings?
[488:50.10]Are you insane?
[488:51.44]I can't even do anything.
[489:09.77]This guy, this pitcher is apparently so tired.
[489:14.47]I can't do anything.
[489:16.17]And wait a minute.
[489:18.03]Didn't he change pitchers twice?
[489:21.48]He did, didn't he?
[489:22.36]He changed pitches twice.
[489:23.26]What?
[489:25.46]Like, I have to throw a strike eventually and he fucking hits it out of the park.
[489:33.60]Oh my god.
[489:46.62]Yeah, it was 15-15 at the start of the inning.
[489:48.54]And they hit a fucking base hit every time they made contact with the fucking bat.
[490:07.88]Is this a child in right field?
[490:10.72]Is this a kid in right field?
[490:12.60]He's missed every single one of those.
[490:15.74]This has to be an eight-year-old in the fucking right field.
[490:17.44]Has to be.
[490:19.32]This person's six years old over there.
[490:36.95]This was so intense.
[490:38.33]What a fucking storybook ending this would have been.
[490:40.39]But I forgot.
[490:40.99]The game's terrible.
[490:42.77]Ah!
[490:48.05]Where's my storybook ending?
[490:50.87]30 runs.
[490:51.67]There are 30 fucking runs.
[490:54.23]I can't stop it.
[490:55.89]It doesn't matter what I do.
[490:56.85]They're going to hit the ball every time.
[491:00.57]Oh, my God.
[491:01.43]Can I finally fucking play?
[491:04.51]What the fuck?
[491:06.01]This hitter is one for five.
[491:10.75]Ball one.
[491:17.39]Oh, that's such bullshit.
[491:18.81]Why do they hit every single fucking ball?
[491:22.25]That's unbelievably stupid.
[491:28.32]That guy throws a hundred fucking miles per hour.
[491:37.19]He throws a hundred and then the next pitch is a fucking curveball that goes 50 miles per hour and arcs across the whole screen.
[491:52.54]Why are there non-cartoon characters in this game?
[491:58.08]That went 60 miles per hour.
[492:04.01]Going from 100 to 60.
[492:07.15]I'm breaking this disk in half.
[492:16.78]Oh, great catch, Danny Phantom.
[492:18.26]Great catch, Danny.
[492:19.74]Wow, he just jumped in and grabbed that.
[492:22.24]He really just jumped into the ball, Danny.
[492:25.20]What the fuck, dude?
[492:31.22]Come on.
[492:33.12]Where was that?
[492:34.72]Why?

[493:07.94]Fuck the Nicktoons.
[493:08.82]Fuck Nickelodeon.
[493:09.66]Nobody watches that shitty channel anymore anyways.
[493:12.10]You know they deleted all the Nickelodeon shows that you like.
[493:16.92]They don't even exist anymore.
[493:17.94]All that's on Nickelodeon is like IRL fucking sitcom shows.
[493:21.62]There's like two shows on Nickelodeon that anyone cares about anymore.
[493:25.44]Nickelodeon sucks.
[493:26.40]The whole network sucks.
[493:35.07]SNAP IT!
[493:39.64]Oh my god, it was so close!
[493:41.76]I had it!
[493:42.34]I just didn't swing with Powder Toast Man because the guy throws fucking wiffle balls!
[493:57.28]I'm so mad!
[493:58.44]It's stupid!
[494:05.14]I am sweating right now.
[494:07.14]Sweat is just dripping off my entire body.
[494:09.76]No, not triple or nothing.
[494:15.63]I had that in the bag too.
[494:28.76]Nicktoons baseball.
[494:30.46]No wonder this has like a four on Rotten Tomatoes, whatever it is.

[494:33.94]Two?
[494:35.02]One?

[495:09.49]I had a good time.
[495:12.35]Oh, I'm so mad.
[495:19.70]I hit like back to back to back all runs to tie the game and then the fucking computer.
[495:39.25]Three in a game.
[495:41.37]Go.
[496:11.20]Ugh.

[496:27.18]I refuse to go out on that one.
[496:29.06]Is this triple or nothing?
[496:31.14]Can I do triple or nothing?
[496:32.11]What's that mean?
[496:32.97]That's... Two billion added to the debt or two billion off the debt.

[501:20.22]I have to capitalize on this ship right now.
[501:22.52]Don't swing.
[501:32.90]That's a base hit.
[501:33.58]Okay.
[501:33.84]He's safe.

[503:04.34]Did I catch it?
[503:07.54]This is the worst game on Steam.
[503:10.99]On whatever platform it's on.
[503:12.17]He's got meter, though.
[503:13.17]This sucks.
[503:18.61]That bitch is a low strike.
[503:33.12]No
[503:58.89]One run comes in.
[504:00.93]It's fucking impossible.
[504:01.81]Into the nothing.

[505:23.89]And has a pitch.
[505:26.45]Blitz's duo.
[505:27.47]Got a little room to improve as a hitter.
[505:29.36]But can surprise you from time to time.
[505:36.64]You can't play this game on All-Star mode and expect to do anything.
[505:39.85]I don't think this is actually possible to win on All-Star.
[505:42.99]Down the right side.
[506:01.82]Stepping in for the first time today, Larry Lobster.
[506:11.26]I don't even know what that ball was.
[506:16.06]I'm going to ignore that.
[506:21.22]You're only supposed to play this with your friends.
[506:22.60]No one's actually supposed to do what I'm doing right now.
[506:25.60]No one.
[506:27.36]Right where it was wanted, but just couldn't connect.
[506:32.17]How was that too late?
[506:33.17]I swung so fucking early.

[506:42.21]Click is stepping up.
[506:46.05]Call one.
[506:51.70]Hey, thanks for the help.
[506:53.06]I don't think that has anything to do with the game.
[506:56.84]Right down the middle of Main Street.
[507:01.60]Out of play.
[507:10.22]Can you reject humanity?
[507:18.80]I'm seething right now.
[507:23.00]My blood is fucking... It's more red than normal.
[507:26.92]It's extra red.
[507:28.92]My blood is ketchup red right now.
[507:30.58]It's as deep red as it can be.
[507:38.48]I thought I could get a fucking pitch that tried to challenge me.
[507:52.14]But I forget I'm not playing against a friend.
[507:54.60]The computer is going to hit that fucking out of the park every time if it's in the blue.
[507:58.62]This is not like Dave, my buddy that's sitting next to me, who's like, oh, I wonder what he's going to throw at me.
[508:07.21]The CPU just goes, blue hit.
[508:09.39]And it's a fucking home run.
[508:10.35]Watch as it go by for the second out of the inning.
[508:14.86]Pitiful humans.
[508:18.24]Strike one.

[508:25.36]Called for a ball.
[508:26.84]One and one count.
[508:31.68]Her ball at the knees for a strike.
[508:39.30]Little umpire, be gone with you.
[508:41.94]Stepping in for the second time.
[508:44.20]Yax batters one for one.
[508:47.50]It's the outside corner.
[508:48.64]Strike one.
[508:54.25]It's that one unaligned to the outfield.
[508:59.61]Yax is aboard with a leadoff single.
[509:02.87]Bottom of the third.
[509:04.07]Nobody out.
[509:08.11]He looks like a different person
[509:37.94]And he gets that call.
[509:39.54]Strike two.
[509:40.14]That's foul.
[509:46.56]Time to pay.
[509:47.88]One run comes in.

[511:05.76]Painting the corners there.
[511:07.34]That's a strike.
[511:10.31]Hold the strig on that curveball.
[511:20.15]Ump says it's a ball.
[511:21.85]It's a one and two count.
[511:23.71]If I win, everything from tonight is erased.

[517:35.67]Runners on second and third, two away.
[517:38.97]Here's the pitch.
[517:41.90]That ball's hit and hit well to the outfield.
[517:45.92]That'll do for this half inning.
[517:47.38]Bill Rudd, two hits.
[517:49.20]Oh, yeah!
[517:55.01]Oh!
[517:59.81]Joints off the full home run.
[518:14.32]See you next week.
[518:41.97]Oh my god, I hate everything.
[518:44.03]Nickelodeon sucks.
[518:49.50]You know, when Nick Jr.
[518:50.88]is better than Nickelodeon, the network, they've crossed.
[518:54.64]Nick Jr.
[518:55.14]is one of the coolest shows, like Paw Patrol and shit.
[518:57.54]It's so much cooler than what's on Nickelodeon now.
[518:59.74]Is this broken?
[519:04.10]Did I break this?
[519:18.78]I thought I was... I did it.
[519:21.92]I went back to where we were at the beginning of the stream.
[519:26.30]Is the debt over?
[519:27.34]No.
[519:28.54]No, what I did today, right there was I said, let's go back to like a billion off.
[519:34.82]So it would be where we were when I put the fucking disk in.
[519:41.30]That was not quadruple or nothing.
[519:42.84]That was just put us back to where we were.
[519:47.66]Ugh.
[519:56.68]That was... I hated that.
[519:57.96]That was fun, though.
[520:03.68]I was way too animated tonight.
[520:05.94]I was so animated.
[520:09.50]I should have been that animated.
[520:11.12]Did I say anything I should take back at the end of the stream?
[520:17.97]Let's see.
[520:18.45]What did I say?
[520:25.00]Did I say anything that was, like, absolutely reprehensible?
[520:28.06]I don't think so.
[520:29.66]What did I say?
[520:30.02]Nickelodeon sucks.
[520:31.70]Every show sucks on Nickelodeon.
[520:33.08]There's one show that's worth watching.
[520:36.48]That's true, though.
[520:47.25]I said Halo 2 sucks.
[520:48.53]No, I didn't.
[520:49.09]When did I do that?
[520:53.34]You said you wanted to strangle Grr.
[520:56.50]Well.
[521:02.57]Oh, that was wild.
[521:03.65]I hope you had fun.
[521:04.57]I did.
[521:04.83]Even though I got a little angry.
[521:12.25]Apologize to Danny.
[521:15.08]What did I say to Danny?
[521:16.44]Oh, Phantom?
[521:24.31]This game is pretty fun.
[521:26.59]Don't let my bullshit fool you.
[521:32.11]I loved it.
[521:32.53]You were so lively.
[521:33.65]I was too lively.
[521:34.69]I don't know what was going on with me.
[521:37.21]I was like going like... I was making so many more Adam Sandlin noises than I typically do.
[521:45.64]I was... I had like a... My blood was hot tonight.
[521:54.68]I'll see you guys on, uh, next Saturday.
[521:58.76]And I know a lot of people were saying, like, hey, chill, you don't want to hurt yourself.
[522:03.02]I mean, I did, when the motherfucker got tackled, I did, I did.
[522:08.15]But, I don't know that going back to, like, six plus seven, eight hour streams sometimes now.
[522:15.51]But I'm only live once a week.
[522:17.37]So, I'll be okay.
[522:19.88]If I feel like kind of sore tomorrow, whatever.
[522:22.20]I'll be alright.
[522:22.90]Two days, whatever.
[522:24.71]I'm able to do it.
[522:25.33]I'm able to get it done.
[522:28.45]So, don't worry about me.
[522:29.95]I'm going to be fine.
[522:32.43]I'm more hot and sweaty than anything else.
[522:38.82]Have a great rest of your weekend.
[522:40.36]Hope everybody has a good week.
