[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.14]Uh-oh.
[00:04.70]I'd say came back.
[00:08.68]I think my game's broken.
[00:10.61]Oh, there we go.
[00:11.70]Alright.
[00:13.00]We should be at 40.
[00:15.03]Hi, guys.
[00:16.95]Let's get Mr. Star in here while we're at it.
[00:28.55]Alright guys, that's stream number one.
[00:31.02]Here comes stream number two.
[00:32.96]This is the second time I've streamed this week.
[00:37.05]Second stream of the week.
[00:39.72]How do I talk to him?
[00:59.65]Up to you, stream boy.
[01:12.71]Hold on, let me get a hold of him.
[01:17.17]Let me get a hold of him.
[01:18.23]I don't even know what button to press.
[01:24.10]Is it this one?
[01:24.71]I don't think so.
[01:40.20]Connected.
[01:40.83]Channel switched.
[01:42.99]Alright, hi.
[01:44.45]Alright, hi.
[01:45.31]People should be able to hear you.
[01:46.61]People should be able to hear you.
[01:48.86]Why are you... Or is that an echo of Jerma?
[01:51.31]Why are you saying the things I'm saying?
[01:54.06]I came up with that joke by myself.
[01:58.56]Okay.
[01:59.36]I'm ready for Overwatch.
[02:02.16]See, look, I'm a little 32.
[02:03.40]I've played this game.
[02:05.79]Yeah, you have.
[02:07.96]32 is a good amount if I played this game.
[02:13.12]Maybe for three of those levels you played with me.
[02:15.17]But, you know, I'll forgive you.
[02:18.79]Thank you.
[02:20.26]Thank you for forgiving me.
[02:25.22]This is just a skirmish, so it don't even matter.
[02:31.60]I'm going to go with Mad Dog.
[02:33.11]Alright.
[02:36.60]40 FPS better, right?
[02:38.43]It should be better now.
[02:40.45]It should actually be a live stream.
[02:43.72]It's not a livestream until you hit 40 FPS.
[02:46.02]That's what I've been told.
[02:47.67]You're doing the weird shit that I do.
[02:53.04]What's that?
[02:54.50]at 40 FPS.
[02:56.96]I don't know, I feel like it's...
[02:59.75]I don't know.
[03:00.76]I feel like it's just not 60, but it's not 30.
[03:06.58]not 30 is good yeah it's not 30 it's not 60 but it's not 30. when you don't stream often
[03:13.05]It's good to not jump into the pool immediately and get all that 60, get all wet.
[03:18.68]Because you're not sure how well your computer's going to handle it.
[03:21.62]You haven't done it in a while.
[03:22.86]I actually really don't think my computer would be able to stably run...
[03:28.62]60 FPS stream.
[03:31.31]I don't think it would.
[03:33.21]Last beta phase, I definitely couldn't.
[03:35.12]This one, it seems a little bit more optimized, but I was doing increments.
[03:38.63]I started at 30.
[03:39.45]I went up to 40.
[03:41.30]And I did 45.
[03:42.48]And I've been just streaming at 50 and no one will know the fucking difference.
[03:46.74]To me, 40 is just...
[03:50.22]I mean, think about it.
[03:51.41]When you turn 40, you know everything at that point.
[03:55.79]You're in your prime.
[03:56.59]40 years old.
[03:57.70]Nothing's wrong with getting older.
[03:59.40]Nothing's wrong with getting older.
[04:00.89]40 years old is when people hit their prime.
[04:02.74]You know what I mean?
[04:03.18]I got a 100.
[04:08.25]Got two 100s, other team?
[04:11.10]I need two 100s.
[04:12.75]Oh!
[04:16.97]Don't worry about it.
[04:17.51]Those people, those people, hold on a second.
[04:19.63]Those people are twice, twice as much as you for levels.
[04:24.63]Yeah.
[04:25.90]There's some guy that's like one with seven or something.
[04:29.21]Damn.
[04:29.55]That's a lot of game playing.
[04:33.67]Somebody just subscribed.
[04:36.56]You gotta test out your emote.
[04:37.83]You gotta test it out.
[04:39.13]You gotta let the presence of the moon guide you.
[04:47.48]The one and only emote.
[04:52.35]The moon.
[04:55.01]Just really change the tides.
[04:57.45]Get the energy from that moon.
[05:07.71]This is probably a bad idea.
[05:10.78]I'm not good at Mei at all, so let me stream myself playing a character I'm fucking bad at.
[05:17.05]Why she's gonna troll them?
[05:20.52]Also, she's bad.
[05:24.07]Your opinion has changed pretty, uh...
[05:27.24]No, I like her.
[05:29.65]But she's still kind of...
[05:30.41]I thought you said that she was, like, really good.
[05:32.64]She's like...
[05:33.75]Okay, you get, um...
[05:35.15]You put some toast in the toaster, right?
[05:38.74]Right.
[05:39.59]You come back, you know, five minutes later, you hear the toast pop, and it's like soggy and wet.
[05:44.60]That's Mei.
[05:51.57]For a second I thought I killed him with the Ice Wall.
[05:53.34]And I was like, that's not possible.
[05:55.98]Ah, he's dead.
[06:08.02]Oh, Zarya.
[06:11.64]I'm gonna catch somebody off guard.
[06:13.83]Zaryatta.
[06:14.15]You gotta do the Zaryatta stuff.
[06:20.46]No!
[06:22.19]I hate that Zarya bubble so much.
[06:25.88]Who's on it?
[06:26.46]Oh, Genji went back, I think.
[06:29.13]Yeah.
[06:36.95]Ooh, I got him.
[06:40.25]Go ahead.
[06:40.70]I'm an ice block.
[06:41.28]He can't even hurt me.
[06:50.40]Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.
[06:56.94]Oh, we have an orb now too.
[07:01.32]Who's that Zarya?
[07:04.99]Walk right into me.
[07:07.70]Oh, I hate you.
[07:08.40]I hate you so much, Zarya.
[07:20.11]You know what I really hate, Zarya?
[07:23.43]What?
[07:23.76]Shields aside.
[07:26.65]You know what it really is?
[07:28.25]The fact that she can make you invincible?
[07:31.67]No, she just, every once in a while, you just see Azaria, she bubbles and you go, oh shit.
[07:39.35]It's just a bad timing and she walks forward and holds left click.
[07:43.36]And does about like a million damage per second.
[07:47.71]Well, I think I got somebody.
[08:01.76]I gotta go to Winnie the Pooh.
[08:05.01]I feel like we need a Winnie the Pooh right now.
[08:13.95]Uh, yeah.
[08:15.15]Yeah.
[08:16.22]Because our actual tank we had at Reinhardt is still there right now.
[08:20.63]We got to get some point presents.
[08:22.63]I tried to get away from it.
[08:23.94]We pretty much lost them.
[08:27.68]Not quite.
[08:29.43]Not yet.
[08:31.02]Yeah.
[08:31.64]Yeah.
[08:32.10]Yeah.
[08:32.84]Quite.
[08:33.67]Yeah.
[08:34.07]Quite.
[08:36.98]I had five seconds objective time.
[08:38.73]That means I did the best, right?
[08:43.49]Yes.
[08:46.80]I have a silver medal with four seconds objective time.
[08:53.55]I think I did one second worse than you.
[08:56.08]Where's our cards?
[09:03.83]I don't understand.
[09:06.78]Hold on, who do I give this to?
[09:11.29]Fine
[09:12.99]No other option.
[09:13.85]Get him a legendary.
[09:14.64]Might as well.
[09:15.84]Look at the ego on this guy.
[09:16.89]Oh, who do I give my divine favor to?
[09:19.88]Who do I bless?
[09:21.80]Yeah, how fucking full of himself is he?
[09:26.80]I didn't vote for anybody.
[09:30.37]Yeah, well...
[09:32.03]You gotta write your name in on the ballot.
[09:37.03]Your own name?
[09:38.00]Yeah.
[09:40.92]Everyone in America just do that when election time comes.
[09:44.66]I wonder what happens if that happens.
[09:45.85]And one person's name will show up twice and they'll win.
[09:48.58]Okay.
[09:49.10]Because, like, someone will have, like, the same name.
[09:50.91]Like, John Smith will probably win.
[09:52.48]How do we take this more seriously against the level 100s?
[09:56.11]They're not that good, but...
[09:57.46]Look at the team rage quit because we were getting dunked on by hundos.
[10:05.32]See, they just got really lucky because sometimes with Temple of Anubis you wipe people on the first point and then you just get to walk on the second one for free when they have no tanks.
[10:14.78]Well...
[10:16.61]That's a couple of hundos, man.
[10:20.00]Uh...
[10:21.81]I don't even know what to do.
[10:23.69]I'm gonna play...
[10:26.00]I'm gonna play Junkrat.
[10:27.87]I got two Genjis, man.
[10:30.19]It wasn't even starting.
[10:31.92]Well, you had a Genji selected.
[10:33.27]You had a Genji on.
[10:34.85]Well, I gotta play Ferret and win.
[10:39.37]You like my wings?
[10:42.25]You don't even got wings.
[10:43.51]None of you guys got wings.
[10:44.84]Hey, they're wiping it anyways.
[10:47.61]Everything's getting wiped.
[10:49.13]They're gonna be wiping my poop off their noggins.
[10:51.56]Wait, when are they gonna give us the Diablo 3 wings?
[10:54.75]For these characters.
[10:58.90]You're really obnoxious.
[11:05.89]Dude, some guy did like the PogChamp with two flexing muscles.
[11:10.32]That looks really funny.
[11:18.59]Okay, what do we got?
[11:21.49]Good.
[11:24.13]You're cut off, man.
[11:27.08]No, no facecam today.
[11:28.33]I'm having a real ugly day.
[11:32.82]You know sometimes you just have to have one of those just ugly days.
[11:38.35]It's one of those days.
[11:39.82]No, I don't know about that.
[11:42.18]Last I heard, I was quite handsome.
[11:45.42]Sometimes I just want to have one of those.
[11:48.30]I don't want to need to worry about my appearance.
[11:55.01]But do you want to ask that?
[11:56.86]Do you want to answer that question for the rest of the day?
[12:00.47]What question?
[12:02.14]Why a new facecam?
[12:04.59]They can rewind the VOD.
[12:10.26]Oh yeah.
[12:23.76]Whoa!
[12:25.77]He was just behind us the whole time, apparently.
[12:28.72]Holy shit, where did this guy come?
[12:30.15]Did this guy come from our spawn?
[12:32.34]That doesn't make any sense.
[12:34.93]He was just walking out the front door.
[12:36.30]I don't know.
[12:41.45]Oh, that was odd.
[12:56.06]Ouch.
[13:02.53]My game's kind of...
[13:05.24]framey for some reason.
[13:07.53]Told you my computer can't handle 40 FPS.
[13:13.36]hold on a second I want to minimize this I'm like taxing my system for no reason
[13:29.74]Oh my god.
[13:37.47]Huh.
[13:39.25]Well.
[13:45.27]No, we already have a Lúcio.
[13:46.80]We just did... No, he switched.
[13:50.89]I think you guys just switched classes.
[13:53.50]He was Reinhardt.
[13:54.58]I don't know.
[13:55.69]I was Junkrat.
[13:56.53]Reinhardt wasn't really walking forward or doing things.
[14:00.88]Yeah, walk forward.
[14:02.16]That's what I plan on doing.
[14:04.33]That's really good of you that you're doing that.
[14:06.05]Get that thing above us.
[14:06.88]It's gone.
[14:15.59]Fuck you all.
[14:16.88]Oh my god.
[14:20.23]Well, that happened.
[14:22.28]I want to see that on his screen.
[14:25.74]I'm just in mid charge, just being fall down guy.
[14:31.84]Goodness gracious.
[14:53.95]They have a telephone that's gone I
[15:04.77]Oh, who's behind us?
[15:08.39]Oh yeah, I do have the Reinhardt skin.
[15:10.36]The axe one.
[15:14.89]I had the axe skin.
[15:21.50]Los Pollos Hermanos.
[15:22.64]Dude, I'm in here.
[15:24.82]Flaming their legs together.
[15:27.52]I'm coming.
[15:29.77]Slowly.
[15:41.81]Do they have like a Pharah or anything we should be worried about?
[15:44.44]No.
[15:45.05]They're really far back.
[15:49.15]I have one other legendary skin, it is Tracer.
[15:53.06]I'll show you.
[15:57.67]Watch out, buddy.
[15:59.34]Eugene KO Ken behind us.
[16:01.54]Oh, yeah.
[16:01.96]He has a sword.
[16:05.30]Here you go.
[16:11.51]You had no health.
[16:13.40]By the way, I didn't.
[16:16.54]I get I get hit by the dragon.
[16:19.87]I just didn't want anybody else to get like destroyed inside of it somehow we Oh
[16:26.53]Did he just high noon?
[16:28.22]Did I block it?
[16:31.03]Oh boy, they're really getting the shield down.
[16:34.56]I have an ult, I don't think it matters
[16:40.03]Oh my goodness gracious.
[16:41.28]That guy hit every single shot.
[16:43.05]He didn't miss with one of those fans.
[16:45.35]Let's see.
[16:45.69]Ready?
[16:48.40]Oh my goodness.
[16:49.20]I don't think he could die so quickly.
[16:58.30]Go now.
[16:59.19]Just go to the point.
[16:59.81]They're all dead.
[17:00.35]They're like all dead except for Symmetra.
[17:04.99]I have my ult to take him out.
[17:19.48]Oh, holy shit he knocked me off
[17:27.97]God damn it.
[17:31.49]I was trying to charge him.
[17:38.87]I thought maybe I could get a lucky charge on him.
[17:42.89]Hey, it ain't luck.
[17:43.61]I'm all gold, buddy.
[17:44.72]Imagination is the essence of discovery.
[17:51.27]Oh.
[18:11.30]My ultimate is ready.
[18:13.21]Well, not mine.
[18:13.92]I'm just saying what she said.
[18:15.17]I don't want to give you the wrong idea here.
[18:19.52]I mean, just switch to Winston.
[18:20.85]I'm aware of my surroundings.
[18:22.40]You?
[18:26.78]I just switched.
[18:27.56]I'm Winston right now.
[18:28.45]Yeah, you just switched to Winston.
[18:30.92]I know you can't have your ult because I know.
[18:33.27]Oh, okay.
[18:34.17]I'm aware.
[18:34.74]Go.
[18:38.76]Oh boy, there we go.
[18:44.10]Okay, buff.
[18:47.27]Maybe we did something.
[18:50.57]Boom.
[18:59.92]How did you all die?
[19:02.21]Did we all get high noon?
[19:03.88]No.
[19:04.37]I died much.
[19:05.23]I was trying to jump in.
[19:09.88]Is anybody still on it?
[19:12.16]Shocking!
[19:19.53]This point is so hard to push if you don't get it in the first 10 seconds of it being available.
[19:30.53]None of us have ultimate abilities.
[19:34.07]I have 70%.
[19:38.31]Like the gore.
[19:54.46]This is a good time to go in huh?
[19:58.17]Maybe?
[20:07.78]mile.
[20:18.19]Do something!
[20:20.04]Somebody help me!
[20:24.53]I was on that point for so long.
[20:27.15]That was a very long time to be on that point.
[20:29.12]Damn.
[20:34.79]Further experimentation required.
[20:47.23]I heard a monkey.
[21:00.75]Shit!
[21:02.75]Oh, he's dead, okay.
[21:05.04]How many do they have dead now?
[21:07.56]Like, one?
[21:17.15]Stormflare to subscribe for four months in a row.
[21:20.50]Oh, now I fell off the thing and I didn't get... Oh, I looked at chat.
[21:24.78]What a mistake.
[21:33.57]Oh, he was reflecting.
[21:44.79]Get on it.
[21:45.89]Get on it.
[21:47.52]No, I fucking pressed Q. I was smashing it.
[21:52.45]I was smashing that button.
[21:55.84]Come on.
[21:56.87]That's dog shit.
[22:05.36]Oh my god.
[22:06.43]We probably would have won if I had been able to press Q.
[22:10.86]We might have actually won the game.
[22:12.41]We actually still might win.
[22:15.26]Let's see how you fucking really go nuts.
[22:18.17]It's monkey time!
[22:22.20]A Lannister always sometimes means...
[22:25.31]If I can get things done, you go monkey time.
[22:29.59]We probably would have won the game.
[22:31.20]We actually would have won the game.
[22:32.62]If the pressing Q actually worked.
[22:39.06]Hmm.
[22:41.35]There was quite a few moments where, like, our whole team was... Well, I mean, I think if this didn't happen as well.
[22:47.94]Whatever this is.
[22:50.28]I'm pretty sure he killed you all.
[22:53.16]No, this is a different time.
[22:54.85]It is a different time.
[23:01.77]I gotta get a new cube.
[23:03.36]I'm gonna get a new keyboard.
[23:06.69]Must have been all the potato chip grease that's underneath it.
[23:13.03]Yeah.
[23:23.68]Yeah.
[23:26.88]Yeah.
[23:28.25]Yeah.
[23:31.34]Maybe I shouldn't have been playing with all the silly putty at my desk.
[23:35.03]I'm like dropping it all over and it getting stuck underneath Q.
[23:45.18]How do you think, uh, Silly Putty, like, your keyboard, like, keys are made out of Silly Putty?
[23:50.06]I think that would be really uncomfortable.
[23:52.47]Hey, D. Miller, thanks for subbing, man.
[23:58.17]Uh...
[24:08.21]Sorry, Jerma.
[24:12.50]Kanye is a 50% better streamer.
[24:24.14]Oh, you have the catchphrase thing.
[24:26.57]I bought it.
[24:29.30]Wow.
[24:30.93]Look at that skin, too.
[24:32.01]That skin's cooler than mine.
[24:35.26]Is that what he looks like?
[24:36.53]Oh, he's like a big bear.
[24:37.81]Look at him, he's a bear.
[24:40.44]He's the big boss.
[24:41.79]Is that your Iron Man thing?
[24:43.05]If I press that, do you die?
[24:44.30]Then face me.
[24:45.10]Yeah.
[24:48.23]I died.
[24:49.12]I got you.
[24:49.50]I killed you.
[24:50.14]Damn.
[24:51.89]Wow.
[24:52.47]I guess that's the theory.
[25:11.63]Hey, we have all the level 100s now.
[25:17.45]How do we keep getting...
[25:18.43]I'm like level 32.
[25:19.86]We're getting cubed with like these...
[25:20.86]The levels don't mean anything.
[25:22.33]Yes, they do.
[25:22.93]It's the amount of experience points you've got.
[25:26.24]That means these guys are experienced.
[25:30.46]And you're not?
[25:31.30]You're telling me you don't have at least 40 years of experience?
[25:35.29]No, 32.
[25:39.05]Each one is a year.
[25:40.98]Well at that rate, they're old and decrepit.
[25:43.93]It's time for some of the new young cats to come in.
[25:46.34]And really show them what for.
[25:48.55]Son, can you go up on the top shelf and get me the book about Thomas Edison?
[25:56.50]I really want to read this.
[26:00.35]But my old hands don't allow me to read.
[26:06.30]Which book is it?
[26:07.93]Honey, it's the one on the top shelf.
[26:10.68]There you go.
[26:12.89]Oh, what a darling.
[26:16.27]You guys ready for this one?
[26:19.05]This is why they call me.
[26:21.86]That's why they call me the quick shot.
[26:24.89]You're about to see it.
[26:28.00]This is why they call me the quick shooter.
[26:30.47]Let's see.
[26:31.63]That's a teammate.
[26:50.19]Shut the ground.
[26:53.83]It just...
[27:08.40]Tell me why they call you the Quick Shooter.
[27:12.57]Maybe one day.
[27:13.25]Hey.
[27:13.77]Hey, can you do me a favor?
[27:32.03]Can you do me a favor?
[27:33.51]Yeah, what is it?
[27:34.80]Show me why they call you the quick shooter.
[27:36.83]Okay, I will.
[27:40.68]one day when you're older hey
[28:02.01]I got a Bastion up there too.
[28:06.50]Oh, that apparently doesn't give me the breakdown.
[28:11.25]I'm in ice form.
[28:17.29]Reload, please.
[28:19.57]Oh my fucking god.
[28:20.90]I thought I had another shot.
[28:27.68]I'm pretty good with those uh those little 100s huh
[28:37.75]Yeah.
[28:39.34]We sure are.
[28:49.43]Well, that's not good.
[28:58.43]Yeah we sure are.
[29:21.14]Are you playing Pharah?
[29:23.49]Oh, looks like I have to.
[29:24.71]One of those games, every game.
[29:29.25]I feel bad for you.
[29:32.06]Why?
[29:32.94]Because it seems like every game you play that you're in is against really exceptionally good players.
[29:39.33]Every time.
[29:41.22]It's always the losing team.
[29:43.51]It's not like, oh, those players are exceptional.
[29:46.90]It somehow always feels like...
[29:50.44]Whichever team is just not as good as the other one.
[29:54.15]And then I like have to bring it.
[29:56.30]If I don't bring it,
[29:59.01]Then why was I put on the team?
[30:01.54]I don't know.
[30:06.02]Pretty sure they have a teleporter.
[30:09.27]That was Shmella Porter.
[30:24.27]Where the hell is everybody?
[30:25.94]What's going on?
[30:32.00]That would have been a nice shot if she wasn't invincible.
[30:43.66]Oh, they have a teleporter.
[30:51.66]How dare they?
[31:13.87]telling me.
[31:19.03]Oh, where is it?
[31:19.87]It's in the bush.
[31:21.48]Teleporter is already down.

[33:58.06]Were they in the vacuum cleaner?
[33:59.08]They're all over me.
[34:00.87]I climbed out of the vacuum cleaner.
[34:03.91]It was horrible.
[34:05.34]Somebody sucked me up.
[34:06.32]A giant sucked me up.
[34:09.51]I was in there with all kinds of coins.
[34:11.76]There was pennies in there.
[34:14.29]Dust bunnies, dead spiders that you sucked up.
[34:19.79]Oh, it was horrible.
[34:26.70]How to play without ability cards on card crawl to get the archer.
[34:31.18]This is a great question.
[34:36.01]Yeah, I understand that.
[34:37.90]I understand it.
[34:39.96]Um, I did that.
[34:42.03]I feel like it was just... Don't sell anything.
[34:50.15]When you play without ability cards, you're not going for any score.
[34:55.15]Make sure you're not selling, oh, I'll just sell this shield.
[34:57.74]It's like three damage.
[34:58.66]You need like every single point of damage needs to be protected.
[35:03.08]if you have a shield or a sword or potions don't sell anything.
[35:06.38]I totally agree.
[35:09.37]You will end up winning those games with like 30 gold.
[35:17.41]Okay.

[35:34.26]What program did you use to make Rat Movie?

[35:45.06]How much is Maya?
[35:47.15]You know?
[35:48.36]I have no idea.
[35:49.79]Hello, hello, hello.
[35:53.53]Alright, nobody gets past the choke point right here, okay?
[35:58.22]GG.
[35:59.66]This is gonna go down, but who cares.
[36:01.45]That's how you play Torbjörn.
[36:08.13]Yep.
[36:09.48]Actually, that's just gonna get sniped.

[36:48.38]it was worth it it was worth it
[36:55.03]Easy dollar.
[36:56.03]Easiest dollar I've ever made.
[36:57.72]Man, they're already on that plane.
[37:01.46]Ah, the damn chain.
[37:08.84]Sit on it.
[37:11.13]What do you want?
[37:12.86]What do you want that dollar?
[37:13.84]What do you want to do with that dollar?
[37:15.61]Uh, charity.
[37:16.25]My choice.
[37:17.46]Okay, what is it?
[37:19.19]Uh, kids stuck in ball pits.
[37:22.14]Parity.
[37:23.67]It's a problem that I don't think people are realizing.
[37:27.53]Do you want this armor pack so we can maybe win a game?
[37:32.05]I have an armor pack for you.
[37:36.30]You're saying maybe so we can win a game guy who stood still with 30 seconds like I really wish you would fucking like take this seriously
[37:59.02]Alright, I'll play.
[37:59.90]I'll try now.
[38:00.79]I'm gonna try.
[38:01.45]Come here, Genji.
[38:02.42]I threw it.
[38:02.98]I frisbeated to you.
[38:04.01]Watch out for the Reaper.
[38:16.62]Our team
[38:24.87]If our team... No, I'm going to stay two of you.
[38:33.08]I'm going to stay middle.
[38:34.26]I'll stay middle.
[38:37.86]Have one, though?
[38:40.04]I will in like five seconds you see if I don't play pharaoh
[38:48.44]Yeah, don't you know the game started a minute ago but that's to help back oh
[38:56.66]Watch out.
[38:58.82]Here he comes.
[39:07.11]He's dead.
[39:09.48]Yeah, I know.
[39:10.48]I killed him.
[39:12.57]I helped.
[39:12.87]I know.
[39:25.62]How does Lúcio even have another ult already?
[39:27.63]It's not like he's... Oh, no, that was our Lúcio.
[39:31.06]Okay.
[39:39.61]Damn.
[39:52.91]You really shouldn't have been messing around in the beginning there.
[39:56.28]Well, I'm going to look... How long was that match?
[39:59.23]Take five seconds off whatever the timer says for
[40:01.80]how long that matches and that's how long it takes to push the cart on King's Row and I'll have that knowledge for the future.
[40:15.79]That didn't even hit me.
[40:19.57]That hit me in the hammer.
[40:20.41]I should have dropped the hammer.
[40:37.57]How long has it been taking you to go from level to level now?
[40:41.84]I've heard someone say that after level 20, the levels aren't scaled.
[40:48.22]How much is your max experience save right now?
[40:50.11]22.
[40:52.24]22,000?
[40:52.80]Yeah.
[40:53.74]That's the same for me.
[40:54.95]So yeah, after level 20, the experience doesn't scale on levels and it takes the same amount of time.
[40:59.64]Huh, okay.
[41:02.75]Which is nice, actually.
[41:04.78]I like the speed that it takes to get the good old 22.
[41:17.70]Uh oh, we got a big boy Hanzo over here.
[41:22.13]Not really.
[41:36.23]I know.
[41:57.34]Oh, hit the ice wall.
[42:00.53]Oi!
[42:05.05]It's my old stomping ground!
[42:08.06]You okay?
[42:08.60]You alright?
[42:09.44]I have a tracer impression.
[42:10.69]Are you okay?
[42:11.80]Yeah.
[42:12.32]Alright.
[42:14.09]Gave me a scare there for a second.
[42:21.71]How am I today?
[42:28.82]I'm good.
[42:30.04]How are you today?
[42:37.57]Do I ever play Winston?
[42:38.58]All the time.
[42:41.47]All the time.
[42:42.47]You stick around, you might actually see it.
[42:52.88]With every death comes honor.
[42:55.98]With honor, we thank you.
[43:07.24]Aww.
[43:21.50]Oh my god!
[43:23.91]How scary would that be?
[43:31.13]Just an arrow was just falling down like rain.
[43:35.24]Do I have a favorite?
[43:37.48]It fluctuates from time to time.
[43:40.15]I don't pick time.
[43:40.81]I love them all equally.
[43:41.73]Sometimes it's Junkrat.
[43:42.91]Sometimes it's Zenyatta.
[43:44.18]Sometimes it's Lúcio.
[43:45.58]Sometimes it's...
[43:47.06]Roadhog.
[43:55.05]I thought he was part of the bush for a second because he was standing still.
[44:16.58]No, you got him.
[44:25.87]Good.
[44:25.99]Shit.
[44:27.60]I got shot by Reaper actually now that 300 health only when he's in his form I
[44:35.09]And he still takes triple damage in the back God damn you don't yeah
[44:44.42]He's still extremely strong though, I think.
[44:46.39]I think he's better than before.
[44:49.16]His damage is just so outrageous.
[44:51.74]Outrageous.
[44:56.27]Ya'll died.
[44:58.81]Who died?
[45:00.30]Ya'll.
[45:01.46]Kind of.
[45:06.51]Come on.
[45:10.23]You will eat my enemy!
[45:18.36]What the hell?
[45:22.59]I'm gonna play Pharah.
[45:23.72]This Winston is freaking me out.
[45:26.54]He keeps doing very odd things and I keep on getting mesmerized by it.
[46:15.40]see that which is there's nobody here
[46:30.31]Whoops.
[46:33.90]Fuck.
[46:35.13]That wasn't even a whoops.
[46:36.17]He just jumped in front of you right before it was about to shoot.
[46:40.29]No, I like, I just like jumped the gun really bad there.
[46:46.46]For some reason, I thought like they were going to wrap around and there's going to be like three people in it.
[46:51.22]You would've got, like, hurt people.
[46:53.35]There's a sniper there now.
[46:58.85]You're a sniper.
[46:59.69]Thank god I didn't.
[47:00.29]Don't worry.
[47:06.86]In my pants!
[47:08.80]Please don't do it!
[47:10.94]Put a diaper on.
[47:20.57]Hey Jerm, are we ever on the winning team?
[47:23.16]Not usually.
[47:30.96]I don't know why the ball didn't see through that.
[47:40.78]Sniper!
[47:44.80]What?
[47:47.39]The fuck?
[47:49.20]What the fuck?
[47:51.85]She did it again.
[47:54.87]Such dog shit come on didn't even mean to this time you're gonna have to help a little
[48:06.87]The battle is not over.
[48:09.44]Yeah, I actually didn't even know that was even possible.
[48:11.91]I thought that it was not a projectile.
[48:13.61]I thought it was like a... Nah, if you look at it when you shoot it too, you can see for a second there's an arrow there.
[48:18.41]Before it even turns into the dragon.
[48:23.36]Oh my lord.
[48:28.81]Alright, I gotta do something else.
[49:08.26]So quiet now We're all getting shot in the back
[49:25.17]Oh, she's revived.
[49:28.16]That's not cool.
[49:57.28]Damn it!
[49:59.31]I denied the Winston.
[50:22.99]Whoa, whoa, easy, easy.
[50:25.75]Easy now.
[50:44.37]How are you alive?
[50:49.79]How is it possible?
[50:57.34]Mercy and D.Va to the left.
[50:59.31]Be careful.
[51:00.06]Aye, aye, aye.
[51:18.66]Oh my god.
[51:23.36]Apparently, Widowmaker, like, whispered that, you know, don't you do it.
[51:27.56]To, like, someone in her close friend circle.
[51:31.79]But I didn't know.
[51:32.73]Shit.
[51:33.35]Oh, there's a pharaoh.
[51:44.96]There was a Pharah up there.
[51:46.87]I should have put on my Pharah goggles to be able to see her.
[51:49.19]Yeah, she just whispered again.
[51:50.37]They have A-Max again.
[51:52.48]We don't?
[51:54.40]What?
[51:54.72]I mean, um, wallhack.
[51:56.54]Oh.
[51:59.95]Nerf this.
[52:01.44]Nerf this.
[52:14.80]Big Winston?
[52:21.14]Oh my Christ, I've got to slide so much stuff.
[52:35.71]I don't give a shit if you're alive.
[52:36.79]I'll get you eventually.
[52:40.07]I always get my fucking prey.
[52:56.94]Told you I always get my prey.
[52:59.63]I told you.
[53:02.52]I listened, I believed you.
[53:06.32]You gonna give me some Jerma juice?
[53:08.04]I need it right now.
[53:10.59]I desperately need it.
[53:12.84]I am in locked in tryhard mode.
[53:14.73]You guys wanted to see it.
[53:18.00]I'm showing it.
[53:22.70]Someone wanted to see it.
[53:24.66]Someone wanted to see your tiny little winky.
[53:39.76]I don't even know which box she is.
[54:03.63]I didn't grab her?
[54:04.36]Are you serious?
[54:12.27]Are you serious?
[54:13.59]Holy shit, we match.
[54:16.29]Oh my god, that was an entire team of matching outfits.
[54:20.13]That was insane.
[54:21.80]I've never seen that.
[54:22.74]I thought that's what you were saying.
[54:25.15]Are you serious?
[54:25.98]That was unbelievable.
[54:26.96]We all had the same outfit on.
[54:32.77]I'm gonna have to look back at that.
[54:35.87]I told you I turned it on.
[54:38.56]You told me I'm gonna need you to do something and I did.
[54:41.67]I like turned it on.
[54:45.53]What?
[54:46.56]Refrigerator?
[54:48.50]No, that's been off for months.
[54:50.37]I store my food in an icebox outside.
[55:03.31]Wasn't a cue of the game.
[55:13.32]What are you doing?
[55:14.28]Don't stop that.
[55:18.78]You're doing like kissy noises.
[55:24.52]Stop it, Ma.
[55:28.75]Well, when it's working, it's working.
[55:40.35]Oh, you have that skin on.
[55:41.50]I told you we matched.
[55:51.14]You didn't believe me.
[55:53.39]Hey, when you do that, you kind of remind me of Spider-Man.
[55:58.32]Alright.
[56:02.59]Hey, can you do that thing that you do that reminds me of Spider-Man?
[56:05.77]What?
[56:06.57]Dude, you gotta do it across the map in front of me.
[56:08.86]Like, you go across my camera.
[56:12.23]Are you serious?
[56:15.07]You have the other worst skin in the game?
[56:17.90]I have all of them.
[56:19.59]You know I have two of those Widowmaker skins.
[56:22.46]Oh yeah, you do.
[56:25.33]This Tracer one's like, okay.
[56:27.21]No, that one's not.
[56:27.84]I thought that was... For some reason, I thought that was the... What's the other one?
[56:32.73]The Zarya that just dashed up to you three times?
[56:35.50]No, no, come on now.
[56:38.98]Fine, I'll play Zenayatta.
[56:44.02]I'm going to play the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
[56:46.41]Who's that?
[56:47.82]Genji?
[56:49.41]Will Smith.
[57:00.32]The card game is Undertale.
[57:05.69]That's funny.
[57:07.50]Awesome.
[57:08.20]It is.
[57:10.80]That's not.
[57:11.85]That is kind of funny.
[57:15.79]No, but the current game isn't Undertale.
[57:18.10]But it's...
[57:20.42]Look, you and I match.
[57:22.34]We're subliminally matching.
[57:24.68]Look, come here.
[57:26.35]You're golden and yellow and I'm golden and yellow and black and stuff.
[57:31.78]I love when you just don't even mean to match
[57:38.33]And you just do.
[57:39.55]If we saw each other at a party, we'd be like, Dude, hold on a second.
[57:42.48]Did you, like, know that today I was gonna wear this?
[57:47.41]I mean, we're both robots and we're both yellow taxis.
[57:50.44]Both yellow robots.
[57:52.17]Can you believe it?
[57:55.67]Consider victory
[57:58.96]I'll give some tips for new viewers.
[58:03.03]You want to get it on as many people as possible.
[58:05.77]Don't ever leave it on somebody for more than a second.
[58:07.66]You get like plus 40% more healing for the first one second it's on someone.
[58:12.03]So you really just want to spread it around as much as you can.
[58:14.92]You don't want to leave it on one person.
[58:16.19]Like what I'm doing right here.
[58:16.91]This is what you want to do.
[58:17.60]You want to get it as far, spread it around as much as you can.
[58:19.57]And it hurts.
[58:20.92]It kind of hurts my head and my hand.
[58:24.44]I would have healed him.
[58:37.19]Oh, that was a bomb on the ground.
[58:43.94]I don't think I'm going to get to play.
[58:45.71]I have Discord on me.
[58:47.44]It's not leaving.
[58:48.93]usually be pretty mad about something like that but that guy just hit literally every shot that was just very good on his part that was just perfect he did he did not do anything wrong
[59:03.34]I wish when you looked at a wall and tried to climb it, that occasionally it would actually happen.
[59:11.00]Be nice.
[59:12.46]That would be awesome.
[59:20.08]Get in there.
[59:20.61]Get in there Roadhog.
[59:22.73]Let's do some stuff.
[59:33.11]Watch out.
[59:37.45]Just die on his bomb.
[59:39.68]For some reason I thought he was gonna have way less health than that.
[59:47.23]New subscriber?
[59:49.20]What's going on?
[60:07.94]Shit, this guy is on me like butter on bread.
[60:13.07]Look at this.
[60:18.72]I have an ult.
[60:26.20]We're all dead.
[60:27.39]I'm the only one in.
[60:28.67]I'm just going to sit back here.
[60:31.31]I'm going to contemplate.
[60:32.23]Thank you for playing, Pharoah.
[60:41.12]That guy so badly wants me dead.
[60:43.13]Man, this guy, he's got my number.
[60:49.99]Well, 76, like, destroys you.
[60:53.55]Alright, well, I got an ult.
[60:54.45]You want to just go in here?
[60:55.27]You want to just get in?
[60:56.06]Yeah.
[60:56.98]Okay, let's go in.
[61:09.55]Oh shit.
[61:13.66]That looked really, really cool of ice cream.
[61:21.60]There we go.
[61:25.18]Do I think Overwatch on Xbox will be populated?
[61:28.21]Absolutely.
[61:31.15]I mean, it is like one of the biggest releases that's coming out this year.
[61:34.42]I think it would surprise a lot of people how many people are going to play it on console.
[61:41.14]It kind of feels like
[61:44.99]When's the last time that something like Halo has been on console and people were like, yeah, multiplayer is good?
[61:52.81]Hasn't happened.
[61:53.67]I feel like this is, uh...
[61:57.10]For consoles, this is the new, like, Halo.
[62:00.44]Could be.
[62:02.59]But it's not Halo, so who knows.
[62:05.10]You have to have the name Halo to be a good game.
[62:07.35]Damn, that guy just got smoked.
[62:11.23]I knew it.
[62:11.79]I was so scared to look out and I got hit in the face by a rocket.
[62:15.69]Was it a rocket?
[62:17.56]Yeah, it was.
[62:18.26]It was a rocket and this.
[62:23.48]That sucked
[62:34.48]Oh boy, oh boy Where is it?
[62:53.79]I have an ult.
[62:56.28]Let's get on cart.
[62:57.63]Okay, I'm going.
[62:58.15]I need help.
[63:01.99]No, we're not gonna do it.
[63:05.53]you're gonna die see me jumping around I'm good
[63:16.64]There's so many people on that roof.
[63:21.39]Just die, don't- Yeah, I'm not gonna.
[63:25.97]Jump like there was four people on it PS4 Xbox One and I feel like this is gonna be one of those games that a lot of people care about for at least I would say
[63:35.52]at least for six or seven months, maybe.
[63:44.63]Depends how much they support it on console.
[63:48.42]And then that also is going to influence how much PC support there is.
[63:54.84]Cross platform for the win.
[63:57.51]Fuck.
[63:59.63]Oh, come on.
[64:01.62]He just randomly got a random spam in there.
[64:06.06]Look at this.
[64:09.23]What the F?
[64:13.69]Who is killing everybody out here?
[64:17.51]Alright, we need to make like a push or something.
[64:21.25]I have an ult, but I've been holding onto it for too long.
[64:34.30]I am a god.
[64:39.93]Let's make a move here.
[64:44.84]Just stay on it.
[64:49.65]Watch out.
[64:54.46]Sides.
[64:59.81]Dammit.
[65:15.76]Well, excuse me
[65:32.13]Man.
[65:35.57]Well.
[65:37.15]Win or lose, I don't think it matters.
[65:39.10]I hit like a really good double air shot.
[65:41.65]So in my heart, I'm a winner.
[65:58.47]They say, a halo in motion.
[66:09.44]There were so many explosion sounds, I didn't even know where the hell that even came from.
[66:17.95]But in my heart, I'm a winner.
[66:25.45]I thought it was gonna be me!
[66:30.77]What's my credit rating?
[66:32.95]In the toilet.
[66:35.46]Just absolutely in the toilet.
[66:39.90]It's probably like... 40%.
[66:50.92]Hey, we got another sub.
[66:56.33]Thanks, man.
[66:57.69]Appreciate it.
[67:10.86]Are we going to go to PAX East?
[67:13.19]That's the plan.
[67:15.40]I know we don't go this year.
[67:18.52]I do not have the time to like,
[67:25.09]Go like 10 minutes out of my way.
[67:26.83]Jeremy, you need a financial advisor?
[67:28.80]I fired my last one.
[67:29.79]I don't know about that.
[67:31.71]I invested $40,000 in Pop Rocks.
[67:36.31]like the stock and it tanked.
[67:38.51]I lost like $39,000.
[67:46.47]Better than I did.
[67:49.84]What the hell do I even wanna do?
[67:51.59]I say that every game.
[67:52.98]It's becoming a trend.
[67:57.27]What do we need?
[68:00.44]Maybe I'll play Mercy.
[68:05.74]And I'll go...
[68:06.50]Heroes never die.
[68:09.46]I'll be watching over you.
[68:15.98]I'll be busy soon enough.
[68:26.46]No, I got out of Pop Rocks a long time ago, man.
[68:35.37]Are you gonna get damage boosted?
[68:40.71]Hey, do you wanna get damage boosted as your character?
[68:46.14]You got a fox head?
[68:47.16]You got a fox helmet on?
[68:48.19]Let me see that fox helmet.
[68:50.67]Jackal.
[68:51.22]Oh my god, I want that skin.
[68:53.92]Just so I can taunt and look at it every day.
[69:05.16]By the way, good luck you're not getting one point of heal the whole game.
[69:09.72]Just kidding.
[69:11.07]I don't need you.
[69:16.23]Oh, I'm right here, man.
[69:17.48]Where does this cut?
[69:28.98]Oh my god that fucking grabbed me around the corner And and I didn't get stuck on the corner
[69:37.76]Everyone needs so much health and I can't even damage boost anybody.
[69:54.53]Well, I got two people back.
[70:00.84]We're all dead again.
[70:02.01]They all are all dead again.
[70:05.25]Yep.
[70:05.47]Yikes.
[70:14.21]I wanna float.
[70:15.09]Oh my god, they were just waiting for me.
[70:22.09]I can't- I'm not going in that room.
[70:25.01]Shit.
[70:26.45]Get me away from that.
[70:31.85]I don't want anything right.
[70:34.32]Ah!
[70:48.41]Oh my goodness.
[70:50.95]We're getting stomped.
[70:54.21]Yes.
[70:55.57]Yes, we are.
[70:56.75]We are like a beetle.
[70:58.36]Somebody's got steel-toed boots on and just crushed us.
[71:12.22]Oh above.
[71:13.59]Oh above.
[71:14.86]Oh above.
[71:26.50]I just want to not die.
[71:36.59]Let's get you back out sir.
[71:38.17]Damage amplified.
[71:50.56]Well, I have an ult again.
[71:51.97]So whenever Nidalee dies...
[72:01.30]That's not good
[72:13.13]Where are you at?
[72:13.67]I haven't seen you in a while.
[72:16.98]Playing the game.
[72:21.73]I don't know
[72:35.18]Oh, this is a good time for me to do something worthwhile
[72:44.45]I did something worthwhile.
[72:48.11]It's high noon.
[72:52.95]Where am I needed?
[73:06.49]Shit, I was trying to save that guy.
[73:08.57]Didn't work.
[73:13.03]Thanks.
[73:17.72]What the hell are you doing over there?
[73:19.32]There's a McCree just right in front of you.
[73:22.12]Make you walk out.
[73:29.50]Aw.
[73:34.46]Everybody's dead, I'm scared.
[73:47.64]There's a guy behind us.
[73:53.83]Holy shit.
[73:57.87]We're getting beat again.
[74:02.65]Yeah, I noticed.
[74:05.22]I switched characters and it's even worse.
[74:09.48]She made a great deal.
[74:28.04]Get in there!
[74:36.77]Oh shit, well...
[74:42.62]They're all dead.
[74:44.77]Yeah, I didn't know that.
[74:45.91]I just kind of sucked in there.
[74:47.52]I was trying to damage boost him doing his ult and, you know, we died.
[74:52.61]Thank you.
[74:54.16]I'm just, I've last ditch effort.
[75:00.57]Had to revive him.
[75:01.96]And change to Winston.
[75:05.72]The battle is not over!
[75:09.44]How many times do I shit my pants?
[75:12.07]A month?
[75:14.23]I don't know.
[75:14.51]A week.
[75:15.07]Holy God, their whole team is on fire.
[75:17.10]That was like a team stomp.
[75:21.01]Yep.
[75:38.02]Everyone came back I'm gonna insta-die again I think I have a box to open
[75:48.91]Let's get out of here anyway.
[75:51.84]Wait, what?
[75:53.07]You have a box?
[75:59.59]Did you open it?
[76:01.88]I thought I would have one.
[76:03.75]I'm probably like a centimeter away from boxing.
[76:09.66]Your celebrated boxing career.
[76:12.72]Yep In the uh, the office room
[76:26.64]I think we're gonna go back to the road dog.
[76:50.20]I totally would have got you.
[76:51.68]No, that doesn't count.
[76:52.47]That doesn't count.
[76:53.05]I would have got you.
[76:53.85]I was under the table.
[76:54.74]No, I would have got you.
[76:55.80]Alright, we'll try it again.
[76:56.77]Ready?
[76:57.81]Okay.
[77:00.39]I got you.
[77:02.06]I got you on my screen.
[77:02.70]No, look, I got you.
[77:04.25]No, but I got you on my screen first, so it doesn't count.
[77:07.02]You stepped in my trap.
[77:08.97]Really?
[77:09.99]Oh yeah, really.
[77:11.08]Nope.
[77:12.98]I got you.
[77:13.40]See, it even bounced off you.
[77:17.70]Hey, wanna get some drugs?
[77:26.02]Let's go.
[77:35.37]Mm.
[77:38.73]Mm.
[77:42.04]Mm.
[77:45.50]Stop.
[77:50.48]Stop.
[77:51.02]You're really giving me
[78:00.52]So I love this spray.
[78:03.28]I really hope this is what he looks like with the mask off.
[78:07.71]Come look at it.
[78:08.70]Oh.
[78:09.52]Oh, yeah, that one.
[78:10.69]I hope that's what he looks like underneath the mask.
[78:14.78]That would be such a disservice to everybody that plays this game if that's not what he looked like underneath.
[78:22.30]If there is a Roadhog skin that is that,
[78:26.33]I don't care if it's 40 bucks, I would buy it.
[78:29.83]It's the best character in the game.
[78:32.38]If it is just a normal guy's face, it would be pretty disappointing.
[78:35.29]That has to be that.
[78:36.90]That is like one of the pigs from space from the Muppets.
[78:43.75]Yeah.
[79:00.54]Come here!
[79:13.99]Wow, Bastion I think just killed everyone.
[79:16.86]And you didn't do anything.
[79:18.47]What?
[79:18.75]What are you talking about?
[79:21.67]I've killed like two or three people.
[79:25.84]Wow, you are insulting.
[79:27.87]I'm getting shit done, man.
[79:34.41]Yeah, nothing that my fucking turrets didn't help with.
[79:37.07]I'm not doing work!
[79:42.22]I miscommunicated, miscalculated.
[79:46.22]I'll get him.
[80:04.53]People are just... What the fuck is... People are just everywhere.
[80:18.06]Well.
[80:21.14]No, we should be good.
[80:25.67]Didn't even turn I would have seen him should have seen him I Just told you I have the teleporter up and you still didn't take it.
[80:34.58]Oh
[80:35.93]I'm reading chat.
[80:37.28]Sorry I tuned you out.
[80:40.96]Nah, I also think they need to do something about the teleporter placement in the spawn because people don't even like notice them.
[80:55.88]Wow, there's a lot of dudes.
[81:07.19]I don't see a teleporter.
[81:26.54]No, that's a high noon.
[81:27.43]I don't know where.
[81:32.16]Did it?
[81:32.91]I think it just hit me and it launched me.
[81:34.15]It just didn't kill me.
[81:36.08]Yeah.
[81:39.06]Yeah, that's what happened.
[81:42.68]Okay.
[81:47.50]Second two late.
[81:58.89]Hey, what's up, dude?
[82:00.02]Oh my god Oh
[82:06.59]It was like Call of Duty Last Stand killed me because I was too busy laughing about what just happened.
[82:11.31]It's martyrdom.
[82:12.31]I thought it was called Last Stand.
[82:15.24]Or martyrdom.
[82:20.26]I think last stand was when you got knocked on the ground and could pistol for a second.
[82:24.01]No.
[82:26.45]Whatever, same thing.
[82:28.95]Oh fire in the hole, I think it's coming from the left That's up top up top
[82:39.21]Can you grab it?
[82:41.66]I think that just destroys it.
[82:42.82]That would be funny if you could pull it.
[82:44.91]That would be so stupid.
[82:51.37]I think he's a little closer maybe.
[83:01.72]Man, I thought I was going to kill him with one of those things.
[83:07.22]I did it.
[83:08.43]Alright.
[83:15.18]Why would you ever want to hook it?
[83:16.85]On a Friday.
[83:17.83]I mean, I could... Why you'd want to hook the tire?
[83:20.97]I don't know.
[83:21.25]Maybe if it's going towards a bunch of people and you could potentially...
[83:24.70]save them by essentially killing yourself and not like three people on your team it also does stun it and make it incredibly easy to shoot
[83:34.18]I think the hook does like 30 or something damage so the tire will have like nothing keep talking and everyone explodes
[83:43.87]No, it happened.
[83:48.31]It happened to both of us.
[83:49.35]Yep.
[83:50.05]Yep.
[83:50.98]The two tanks that you'd kind of want to be there.
[83:52.97]It happened to both.
[83:54.63]I don't know.
[83:55.14]Like, do teammates block the Lúcio?
[83:58.15]I think it's something to do with the stairs, probably.
[84:00.54]The door?
[84:09.79]It's definitely something to do with the stairs.
[84:11.76]Has to be, right?
[84:26.18]Hmm.
[84:31.73]I think there's a tiny little like, I don't even know.
[84:35.02]Maybe Lúcio is like getting up over the door where we are.
[84:39.44]But everyone else got it, and we were standing where they were.
[84:42.47]Yeah.
[84:44.13]I don't know.
[84:44.65]It's weird.
[84:44.96]I hope they fix it soon.
[84:47.43]Them fixing that would be very good.
[84:52.37]Really sucks when that happens to your team.
[84:55.03]I'm just gonna go in and ult.
[84:59.20]Oh, they have a Bastion like up in a weird spot I've never even seen.
[85:04.50]Oh no, I don't want to get him now.
[85:06.47]No one ever goes up there.
[85:07.68]That's a good spot.
[85:11.45]Holy shit, I got him somehow.
[85:14.75]I'm dead.
[85:15.66]I'm so dead.
[85:21.68]Yeah, that's the way we do team working.
[85:31.11]Ah, he's trying to get over it.
[85:34.32]Damn.
[85:39.57]Forget about it, forget about it.
[85:44.15]We can hook him.
[85:47.28]Well, I got him, but I'm kind of dead.
[85:50.83]Yeah, I'm dead.
[85:51.60]Maybe not.
[85:53.79]Wow, I have 10 health.
[85:56.59]Nobody, oh!
[86:01.91]Aww.
[86:03.15]Shit.
[86:03.82]I wish you could give me your death.
[86:05.95]That'd be great.
[86:06.75]Take it, man.
[86:07.61]Take it, buddy.
[86:10.95]Alright.
[86:22.78]I don't get it.
[86:23.32]What's so important about this gazebo?
[86:25.01]Why capture it?
[86:25.90]That's a good question.
[86:28.27]Whoever gets the gazebo gets the, uh...
[86:31.90]It's the free DVD that comes with it.
[86:38.10]Oh.
[86:38.84]That's not our Reinhardt.
[86:40.25]That's not our Reinhardt.
[86:41.95]Yeah, he did.
[86:43.88]I think it's actually working out that well for that Bastion.
[86:53.61]I'm waiting for like a couple of them.
[86:55.44]I'm just gonna ult the shit out of them.
[87:00.94]I know one on the right.
[87:02.94]Solid.
[87:03.57]Right corner.
[87:09.22]No, I missed it.
[87:10.99]I missed it.
[87:13.15]Shit.
[87:14.36]Ah, I thought that was a pharaoh.
[87:16.73]I thought it was a pharaoh for some reason.
[87:20.31]What do you mean you thought it was a Pharah?
[87:21.60]Like, when we were just taking a shitload of damage in one second, I thought it was a Pharah.
[87:24.47]Like, rocket barrage or something.
[87:26.53]It was.
[87:26.75]No, that was a Bastion.
[87:28.46]No, Barret was also doing it.
[87:31.06]It was mostly Bastion.
[87:33.61]I'm going this way.
[87:48.05]Oh, this is not good.
[87:51.10]I lost that fight.
[87:54.70]Not good.
[87:56.05]Not good.
[87:57.63]I don't care, give me another point.
[88:03.11]Nice ride.
[88:07.64]Did we lose?
[88:08.77]Oh.
[88:08.85]Wow.
[88:10.63]Lúcio broke it down and was like a centimeter away from going forward.
[88:15.63]Why do I have two moon emotes?
[88:18.41]I don't know.
[88:19.24]I like screwed it up and it never got fixed.
[88:25.50]Do you?
[88:25.90]You do.
[88:26.40]You're dumbass.
[88:30.01]No, one of
[88:30.49]one was too light and I wanted to darken it up so it said if you make it the same name it will replace it and it just didn't replace it.
[88:37.38]It's both the same name.
[88:39.30]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[88:41.05]If you make it the same name, it replaces it.
[88:43.88]Alright, okay, who's gonna get left behind?
[88:48.75]Just the biggest character.
[88:52.72]Just me.
[88:55.49]This really throws me off my game, man.
[89:02.29]You want to see the cheeseball strategy with Roadhog?
[89:06.92]Oh, you didn't get to see it.
[89:09.11]What was it?
[89:10.20]You pull them over here and they just fall in the pit.
[89:12.46]You what?
[89:13.31]Oh.
[89:14.13]Oh, that.
[89:30.91]He actually, the Roadhog just, oh the Junkrat just jumped off.
[89:37.90]Oh I just got smoked.
[89:45.06]I got really badly hurt.
[89:50.53]What face is that?
[89:51.67]That's the moon.
[89:53.46]I went outside with a telescope and I pointed it at the moon and I took a snapshot with my digital telescope.
[89:59.42]It's not a face.
[90:03.66]I've got you.
[90:14.41]He's gonna die, die, die.
[90:16.34]Is he?
[90:17.46]I guess not.
[90:18.24]He's coming down the drop down, I think.
[90:20.31]No, he's coming all the way around.
[90:25.29]He did.
[90:27.12]I say he did.
[90:28.34]I meant we did.
[90:29.77]By the way.
[90:31.54]This map is hazy and it gives me a headache.
[90:47.16]A little too high.
[90:59.21]He's been anything rumor shield I'm good.
[91:05.59]I
[91:09.91]was here too, but nothing much I can do there.
[91:16.71]OG Tortilla.
[91:18.50]Just subscribe.
[91:19.79]Bye.
[91:23.84]Come on.
[91:24.08]We got 89%.
[91:25.31]We can do it.
[91:27.65]We can do it.
[91:41.84]Oh, I thought there was like three people here.
[91:47.34]Well, there's a guy here.
[91:55.24]I thought there was like a couple people there I screwed it all up though but it's okay we're fine
[92:03.78]An odd hook.
[92:08.40]She's gone.
[92:11.34]Oh my god.
[92:13.21]No!
[92:21.26]How many wasted ults is that?
[92:22.42]Oh, it's probably like a dozen at this point.
[92:27.79]We should win the game right here though, right?
[92:29.87]No, they're all on it.
[92:32.01]You guys could probably re-push it.
[92:33.33]There's a McCree behind y'all.
[92:38.85]Boy, they're all like up in our face here.
[92:51.30]Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
[92:54.97]Like, you've seriously got to be kidding me.
[92:56.68]I've never seen that health kit over here.
[92:58.51]I've never been over there.
[93:01.96]Shit.
[93:02.93]No, we gotta win.
[93:03.82]This is such a good game.
[93:10.57]Did Tracer just kill three people with her ult?
[93:15.27]Well, that just means we're all going to spawn together and we'll be easier.
[93:19.63]That was such a good Lúcio ult.
[93:22.81]But, I died.
[93:32.76]Gotta get a push.
[93:34.86]Push!
[93:38.44]Man, I keep getting denied because of fucking... Goddamn bullshit, McCree, man.
[93:45.31]Second fire.
[93:46.13]Fucking bullshit.
[93:48.38]yeah we just think suddenly at the end our whole team was dying to a tracer uh that that tracer did a bomb and killed three people
[93:57.07]She wiped out three people.
[94:02.28]We're about to see the League of Explorers.
[94:06.52]Let's see what it was.
[94:11.03]Oh yeah, he hit like three people off.
[94:12.21]Yeah, he did.
[94:17.44]That was a good game.
[94:22.22]That was a good game.
[94:43.90]Somebody just subscribed.
[94:44.85]Jay Lemon.
[94:47.56]The Lemonator.
[94:50.63]Welcome to the coaster.
[94:53.12]Those hands up.
[94:57.18]Get those hands up.
[95:04.93]I'm gonna go take a pee-pee.
[95:11.72]Hurry up.
[95:12.94]We don't have much time.
[95:19.93]What's my favorite class?
[95:21.86]I don't know.
[95:22.46]I feel like I play the best with, um, Roadhog.
[95:26.14]But...
[95:27.32]Personal preference-wise, a character I actually like.
[95:30.34]He's the guy.
[95:30.89]I love him.
[95:31.39]He's so much fun.
[95:32.32]Probably Zenyatta.
[95:33.89]But it's hard to play Zenyatta sometimes.
[95:35.43]He's so squishy.
[95:37.24]And I end up pushing my face out too often.
[95:40.67]So it's probably actually Roadhog.
[95:44.71]Or Junkrat.
[95:46.66]Which is the character we're going to play for this game.
[95:51.08]It changes.
[95:58.56]Favorite breakfast cereal?
[95:59.56]Are you kidding me?
[96:00.05]That's easy.
[96:01.60]Cap'n Crunch, man.
[96:14.66]I think Roadhog is fine.
[96:15.86]Just landing the hooks.
[96:17.65]Just trying to get that timing down is actually a lot of fun.
[96:26.15]Don't step in that.
[96:26.82]Don't step in it.
[96:27.49]Do not step in that.
[96:33.83]Another sub?
[96:35.56]Jeez.
[96:36.68]Thanks.
[96:37.37]Welcome.
[96:37.67]Hi.
[96:38.39]Thank you.
[96:42.58]I'll allow you.
[96:43.09]Better hurry up.
[96:44.55]Opinion on Reese's Puffs?
[96:46.46]A little too much.
[96:48.21]It's a little too much.
[96:50.46]You know what I mean.
[96:57.42]Just a tad too much.
[97:00.19]Actually, I don't want to play Junkrat here.
[97:12.10]Should I embarrass myself on Genji?
[97:13.76]What do you think?
[97:17.18]Yeah, I could go for another loss.
[97:18.84]You wanna go for another loss?
[97:20.53]Yeah.
[97:22.22]Because this is going to be embarrassing.
[97:24.89]This is like the ninth time I've played this character since the beta launched.
[97:28.19]Maybe like eighth.
[97:30.76]Have fun?
[97:31.54]Yep.
[97:32.67]Fair warning, guys.
[97:33.92]This is probably going to be bad.
[97:46.29]Golden Grahams actually were pretty good back in the day.
[97:51.25]Not anymore.
[97:52.21]They really fucked up the recipe.
[97:56.50]I really could be.
[98:02.19]Man.
[98:04.97]Mark, go get me some golden grams.
[98:10.85]What about smacks?
[98:12.35]Did you ever like smacks?
[98:15.23]Oh, yeah.
[98:16.09]Yeah.
[98:16.68]Yeah.
[98:17.52]Yeah.
[98:19.13]You know why I like smacks, right?
[98:20.22]The cardboard cereal.
[98:21.87]Why do I like smacks?
[98:24.05]The frog?
[98:25.48]Yeah.
[98:27.27]The cartoon frog character.
[98:36.09]Three, two, one.
[98:53.94]I haven't hit one marker on somebody, by the way.
[98:57.85]We just started.
[99:13.26]Getting shocked.
[99:36.87]Playing this character Alright, how many hit markers did I get guys maybe maybe one or two I
[99:52.90]Maybe I'll equally embarrass myself on Pharah.
[99:55.71]That sounds like fun.
[99:57.01]And I have the twitch.tv skin, too.
[99:58.80]The official twitch.tv purple skin.
[100:04.11]So I have to use it.
[100:27.60]I just really screwed up that ult for him.
[100:39.97]Whoa, what?
[100:57.77]What's my favorite game in terms of humor?
[100:59.69]I don't know.
[101:06.45]I do tail.
[101:08.32]No, I mean, like, there's different... Just people...
[101:12.83]There's different versions.
[101:13.81]Like, there's actual games that try to make, like, jokes, and then there's, like, the game was...
[101:17.78]Just funny?
[101:19.09]Because it was bad?
[101:24.38]Oh my goodness.
[101:34.15]Well, I have to stay on her.
[101:45.59]Do I find it hard that the enemy team is not a different color?
[101:48.55]No, because they're highlighted in red.
[101:50.88]So it makes it a little easier.
[101:54.67]Just a little bit to have them glowing red.
[101:58.26]Just a little bit.
[102:10.47]Are we going to lose you?
[102:17.65]Well, I...
[102:19.62]I made them all run away.
[102:21.27]I made them all run away.
[102:22.83]They were already getting pushed away.
[102:25.32]I...
[102:26.99]I did a lot of work there.
[102:30.04]That was pretty much...
[102:31.76]I'm going to say like 60% me.
[102:35.15]Just to let you know.
[102:36.86]If you're curious.
[103:00.47]There you go.
[103:05.65]This guy just keeps getting away from me.
[103:22.76]Farah reporting.
[103:25.97]Right, it's going around.
[103:35.95]Ooh, there's a person in here.
[103:41.05]There's a person in there.
[103:41.95]Holy fuck, there's a person in here!
[103:44.72]They're like all up top.
[103:55.95]Didn't they make Overwatch by scrapping that MMO they were working on or something?
[104:01.80]I believe some of the maps, maybe.
[104:04.37]of the areas in the game.
[104:07.19]Or maybe some of the characters do.
[104:08.07]I don't know.
[104:08.58]Who knows how much of that was reused.
[104:23.66]That's gonna be a good dragon.
[104:36.08]I didn't kill him.
[104:37.72]Thank you for finishing the job that I couldn't finish.
[104:39.71]No problem.
[104:42.08]That's why we're friends.
[104:43.74]That moment right there.
[104:45.45]That's how we met as well I was not close enough
[105:03.91]I'm still there I'm really hungry, dad
[105:13.05]What are you making for breakfast?
[105:14.76]What am I making for breakfast?
[105:16.21]Yeah, dad.
[105:19.34]I don't know.
[105:24.80]Is there a tracer?
[105:26.46]Not on our team.
[105:27.47]No, I didn't.
[105:33.35]I was gonna go up top, but I decided not to at the last second.
[105:38.56]Bastion's gonna try to deploy over there on the right.
[105:58.89]Are you serious?
[105:59.67]Right when I dropped, I'm the only one that died from that.
[106:05.49]Watch this.
[106:09.74]Ryu is going to eat my enemy!
[106:17.77]When's the next Jerma Rumble?
[106:18.73]Oh, they got a double Reinhardt.
[106:21.77]May.
[106:41.95]There's two right here.
[106:44.74]Nice.
[106:46.11]Good work.
[106:55.27]You're gonna win right here?
[106:56.09]Yay, we did.
[106:59.63]Let's break it down.
[107:01.65]What was my first job?
[107:04.11]Um, I was a, like, bar person.
[107:08.67]Like, I was, like, a bar, like, busboy, cleaning tables, things, kind of stuff.
[107:15.63]Why don't robots do that yet?
[107:18.25]I mean, it wasn't like a bar, it was like an event hall, like a function hall.
[107:30.72]That's a long time on the objective.
[107:42.72]Hope everyone's having a good day.
[107:43.87]Hope everyone's having a great day.
[107:49.37]I played very very average that game.
[107:52.81]I wasn't really doing much.
[107:58.90]I was kind of just flying around.
[108:00.06]That does sound average.
[108:07.57]I wasn't a bartender.
[108:11.69]I was like 15 or something bussing tables in a function hall that people rented out.
[108:19.15]There was like a big bar in it.
[108:21.74]It wasn't like really a bar bar.
[108:26.10]Oh, Bar Bar Binks?
[108:28.48]Yeah.
[108:29.92]You know he's a Sith Lord?
[108:32.31]Yeah.
[108:33.13]That was his first job.
[108:37.88]Alright, he saw one already picked, Widowmaker.
[108:40.17]I guess I'll play a different sniper instead.
[108:42.64]I'm gonna play D.Va with my new skin.
[109:00.28]Nightbot is Undertale trash.
[109:08.27]No, Nightbot has not been updated.
[109:10.19]I'm sorry.
[109:12.69]I'm sorry.
[109:21.71]I like this character because you can just ratchet off, you know?
[109:28.39]Gotta go for the gas tank.
[109:29.57]That's how you blow the car up.
[109:30.42]You gotta go for the gas tank.
[109:32.39]Come on.
[109:35.47]Come on.
[109:37.12]I just want to...
[109:41.06]It's on the other side.
[109:42.81]No, it's not.
[109:44.58]It's right here.
[109:45.02]Oh, there is no gas.
[109:47.29]Look.
[109:48.23]They're on, like, hoverboards.
[109:49.53]Guys, there is no gas.
[109:58.04]Nope, you're not gonna hit me.
[110:23.13]I'll tell you to get away from a Roadhog.
[110:25.89]Thought he was gonna chase me.
[110:29.51]Nah, he was getting shot at, man.
[110:41.61]I love it right now.
[110:43.46]You just flew away from it.
[110:44.45]Well, I have 7 HP.
[110:45.94]Do you see how much HP I have?
[110:48.53]Where's the health pack?
[110:49.65]Is it right here?
[110:50.48]I actually can't see how much health you have, so... Maybe if you tried a little harder.
[111:04.93]Shit, there's a boss behind me.
[111:07.50]Shit, there's a Roadhog behind me.
[111:09.48]Roadhog is just behind me.
[111:10.51]Come on.
[111:10.89]Come on.
[111:13.21]Aye!
[111:13.79]Right when I got it.
[111:15.65]I
[111:23.51]Huh?
[111:24.84]I thought it was Saturday
[111:31.39]Nope, you are incorrect.
[111:40.44]Dammit, they got him.
[111:53.68]Is somebody in there?
[111:56.54]Yeah, back up, cause, yeah.
[112:06.29]Oh, jeez.
[112:07.99]He actually just got me.
[112:14.91]I cannot believe I'm alive.
[112:17.23]Their whole team was a firing squad and didn't kill me.
[112:20.28]I don't know how I'm alive.
[112:22.67]Yeah, I kind of saw that.
[112:28.84]Stay behind me, stay behind me.
[112:39.46]Oh, Frozen, you froze me.
[112:48.54]Oh.
[112:58.58]What's the egg been up to?
[112:59.49]He's been cracking some jokes.
[113:12.71]That's pretty accurate, too.
[113:13.66]He's a professional comedian now.
[113:16.40]The egg.
[113:35.32]Nerf this!
[113:43.47]Ah Tracer behind us
[113:55.57]Yep.
[114:07.50]Press Start to continue.
[114:11.07]Why am I not playing Hanzo?
[114:14.66]Because...
[114:16.12]I'm not very good with Hanzo.
[114:18.98]There's 21 characters.
[114:20.32]Why are you not playing specifically that one?
[114:26.29]The odds are against you.
[114:29.93]Alright, once I get this ult, we're literally going to skee-ball it.
[114:36.91]Okay, how did that work for her?
[114:41.62]That's not supposed to work.
[114:44.29]Not really.
[114:48.51]He's behind me.
[114:57.03]Are we gonna lose?
[114:57.94]Is this gonna be a lose?
[115:00.51]Is it going to be a lose?
[115:01.83]It can't be a lose.
[115:02.80]Yeah, they have a badge.
[115:03.56]Too much riding on us.
[115:12.35]I love how he's the tank.
[115:14.20]The bird in the middle?
[115:17.63]Seems kind of dangerous for the bird to be hanging out in the middle.
[115:31.76]He just was back there doing whatever the hell he wanted, huh?
[115:35.05]Yeah, Ma.
[115:36.92]Yeah, yeah!
[115:38.81]I'll do it!
[115:42.46]You need to calm down
[115:52.97]Alright, I think I want to get to level 35, and then the second I hit 35, just end the stream.
[116:02.22]Get to 35, stream end.
[116:06.32]Okay.
[116:06.44]So it's gonna take like another maybe like two or three games.
[116:09.49]Or three hours.
[116:10.86]I'm level on level five.
[116:14.02]Yeah, I'm gonna stream when I get like 30 levels.
[116:17.88]There's my Tracer skin, see?
[116:19.90]You saw it, because I never play this character.
[116:21.51]Don't worry.
[116:27.06]I'm so glad this is a skirmish.
[116:29.94]I really hate Temple of Anubis.
[116:32.71]I hate this map.
[116:33.98]Is that okay for me to say?
[116:35.39]Do you like this map?
[116:36.44]I hate this map.
[116:37.65]I like this map.
[116:38.51]I hate it.
[116:42.57]It's really bright, the sun gets in my eyes, and the last point is obnoxious.
[116:51.46]Is that okay?
[116:52.36]Is that okay for me to say that?
[116:55.83]Is that okay?
[116:57.15]Kiss my ring.
[117:01.21]What, did you win the Super Bowl?
[117:03.64]No, I'm the mob boss and you come in and ask me for one favor and that favor is to not like Temple of Anubis.
[117:09.97]You want to come in here, and you want to tell me that you don't like the Temple of Anubis?
[117:15.79]Well, let me tell you something.
[117:17.47]That fucker's not going to fly here.
[117:19.96]You'll get your fucking yellow belly ass out of here.
[117:25.53]Pretty much that.
[117:28.03]Before I stick my fucking goons on you.
[117:32.97]You ever have a goon up your ass?
[117:35.08]You ever have a goon up your fucking ass?
[117:37.70]You're about to have two.
[117:40.49]Oh, man.
[117:42.48]You ever stop those Goombas in that game Super Mario Brothers?
[117:48.34]Well, that's you.
[117:49.49]You're a fucking goomba.
[117:51.42]To me.
[117:55.06]Can we get into games so I can stop doing this?
[117:58.05]There you go.
[118:04.31]A whole entire goon.
[118:06.64]Hey.
[118:07.82]You wanna make 25 million dollars?
[118:09.99]Hey.
[118:10.66]You wanna play against different people?
[118:13.81]Yeah.
[118:14.87]Um, is that, are we, have we, did you guys, the whole time?
[118:18.73]Is that the whole time?
[118:19.93]No, we got a level one.
[118:21.34]What is this guy doing here?
[118:22.70]He should not be here.
[118:25.04]I mean, yesterday I played with Melee.
[118:27.39]He was level 1.
[118:28.02]I know, but like, what if this guy just wants to try Overwatch for the first time and he's playing with the legendary star?
[118:35.44]I doubt there's any way he got in here without being invited to a party.
[118:40.69]No.
[118:42.92]You know what I'm saying?
[118:43.56]You're picking up what I'm laying down.
[118:44.48]Do I want to show people that I'm not bad and play Roadhog, or should I show people how bad I am and play any other character in the game?
[118:53.18]Okay, fine, we'll do that.
[118:56.11]I wanna play Winston.
[118:58.08]I'm on alright.
[118:58.83]I'm a good Winston.
[118:59.61]Would you say that?
[119:00.31]I'm an okay Winston?
[119:02.04]Everyone isn't okay, Winston.
[119:04.21]Actually, no, you're not.
[119:05.64]Thanks for the confidence boost.
[119:07.69]I take back what I said.
[119:08.81]I just pressed alt.
[119:11.61]I'm going in.
[119:12.51]Okay.
[119:14.92]I'm going to play Widowmaker now.
[119:17.90]You really want to win this?
[119:21.50]You want to lose this game?
[119:23.18]You're a really great Winston.
[119:24.33]I think we could use a Winston on the team.
[119:26.64]Oh, really?
[119:30.74]Right in the chest, right in the heart.
[119:34.88]I hope you have no fun.
[119:37.37]We have a Reinhardt, we're fine.
[119:39.74]You're still not gonna have any fun.
[119:41.24]Tell me when you get a headshot.
[119:45.10]Okay.
[119:45.51]Like, let me know.
[119:47.85]I'll look up the kill feed to verify.
[119:58.52]What's the fly button?
[119:59.97]There it is.
[120:05.55]Gas him!
[120:25.60]And if this Orb of Discord ever goes off me...
[120:32.74]Imagination is the essence of discovery!
[120:38.29]The joke is I landed in front of you and I'm not Widowmaker.
[120:41.01]What happened?
[120:45.63]Nothing.
[120:46.29]Just didn't feel like playing it anymore.
[120:49.46]I see your cat's laughing.
[120:59.61]Thank you.
[121:11.72]Further experimentation required.
[121:24.92]Damn.
[121:30.04]Oh, this is...
[121:38.99]Fuck this.
[121:42.93]Fuck it.
[121:45.07]I didn't want it for real this time.
[121:51.29]Darn.
[121:52.14]I thought I could kill Torgrim by showing up and surprising him and ulting him.
[121:56.08]But then he and his sentry collectively gained, I don't know, a thousand health.
[122:05.15]Oh my goodness gracious.
[122:09.23]Get in the door.
[122:09.95]Get in the door!
[122:16.37]How'd Winston go?
[122:18.73]That wasn't good either?
[122:23.71]Why did I think I was going to die falling over there?
[122:51.54]They have a teleporter on the point How did we get through the choke point
[123:01.76]Holy shit.
[123:20.48]Is there a turret up top?
[123:21.46]No, that's it.
[123:22.91]Six!
[123:24.24]Sixxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
[123:30.08]Thank you.
[123:36.46]We're back at the choke again.
[123:46.40]Uhhh...
[123:50.28]Aha, you thought I was gonna try to pull you, but I didn't.
[123:53.58]I faked you out.
[123:55.53]Alright, we're getting this right fucking now.
[124:03.49]No, no.
[124:09.79]Somebody just said, hey, Jerma, fuck you.
[124:12.40]How dare you.
[124:24.27]Are you serious?
[124:26.52]Where was he to shoot that perpendicular to where we are?
[124:37.56]Fuck you guys.
[124:41.72]I'm just gonna take hits and die.
[124:52.19]Well, I'll tell you why something is wrong here.
[124:55.73]I had gold in eliminations, final blows, and objective kills.
[124:59.89]And you were the flip flop jump tank.
[125:04.93]I was flip flop jump guy.
[125:07.25]And then I went Roadhog for the last, like, two minutes.
[125:11.51]The only thing you're not golden is damage done, which is what I was doing.
[125:15.84]I mean, but... What's going on there?
[125:23.39]Well...
[125:29.32]Started as Widowmaker did nothing went to Winston did nothing and then went to Roadhog and killed a few people
[125:41.74]That was just what we call a team stump.
[125:50.01]What are you doing?
[125:51.83]I left so maybe we can get matched up against not-team-of-people with, like, level 10s and the tank that did the most.
[126:00.49]You know?
[126:01.33]I guess.
[126:03.13]Sarah's already in a party.
[126:04.15]Also, my Hanzo has Tidehunter.
[126:05.08]How are you in a party?
[126:07.34]I invited you and you tried to invite me.
[126:11.60]You're gonna have to invite me again.
[126:12.50]I don't see your thing here.
[126:14.51]I had to leave the game I was in.
[126:17.87]Okay, go for it.
[126:19.05]Don't you- change your avatar, dude, really?
[126:23.55]No, all the avatars are stupid.
[126:25.72]What about the bomb-smiley guy?
[126:27.35]The Bomb Smiley Guy is okay, but I don't have Bomb Smiley Guy.
[126:30.29]All the other ones are neon colors that don't go together of a character's vector portrait face.
[126:36.62]And I'm not interested.
[126:40.12]Sure.
[126:41.20]Oh, you can have the Lich King.
[126:44.16]Who is the Lich King?
[126:46.71]As an icon, as my level 50 box, I was like, oh, level 50.
[126:50.34]50.
[126:50.82]Big level.
[126:51.30]You get your wings, everything.
[126:52.63]I'm going to get an awesome loot box, right?
[126:54.32]I got a murloc.
[126:58.71]Well, there you go.
[126:59.53]Lich King and a Hearthstone Spring.
[127:01.77]How come they get all the level 70s?
[127:03.70]71, 75, 75, 65.
[127:06.47]Where's our level 70?
[127:09.21]Yeah, Peroni.
[127:11.52]Um...
[127:15.68]I'm leaving.
[127:16.75]That's a team of four people.
[127:18.55]What?
[127:19.66]What do you want?
[127:20.93]Come on.
[127:21.55]You play.
[127:23.76]Have fun.
[127:24.34]Have fun.
[127:25.03]On Temple of Anubis.
[127:26.29]Have fun.
[127:28.14]But, I mean, you can't just, like, ditch a game.
[127:31.65]To make people extra salty, I think I should have one steak.
[127:35.49]I understand that we're going up against a team of at least four people.
[127:40.44]who are probably going to stomp because they're all in communication and they're all good.
[127:44.40]But you know what?
[127:46.12]Hey, I'll watch your stream.
[127:48.06]No, no, I'm gonna spectate you.
[127:50.07]Go ahead.
[127:50.49]And I'm gonna talk shit the whole way.
[127:52.06]Go for it.
[127:57.09]What do we have?
[127:57.90]Do we...
[127:59.04]I don't know.
[127:59.41]I'm just going to stay drunk, right?
[128:00.85]I'm just going to spam.
[128:03.43]I don't even...
[128:04.45]I don't even give a hoot.
[128:05.88]Oh, look at that.
[128:06.43]It's a witch's cauldron, except it's not.
[128:08.50]It's like the mustard.
[128:15.32]Let's do it.
[128:20.80]They're going to get crushed.
[128:21.59]I don't.
[128:22.13]You just can't abandon the game.
[128:24.58]You can't abandon ship.
[128:25.56]You go down with the ship.
[128:27.87]I want to go down with this ship.
[128:29.18]I don't want people who party getting mashed with randomness.
[128:32.46]Well, I'm the captain of this ship right now.
[128:34.61]I'm screaming.
[128:36.41]Have fun.
[128:37.05]Oh, hit that Reinhardt.
[128:37.92]Hit that Reinhardt right there.
[128:39.76]Is it?
[128:40.07]Oh, you're going to shot your back.
[128:40.87]There's Reaper.
[128:41.41]Reaper to your left.
[128:41.99]Reaper to your left, dude.
[128:43.38]Where is he?
[128:44.34]Find the tree.
[128:45.38]180 degrees.
[128:46.27]Alright, there's a nest to the left.
[128:49.35]Heavy nest.
[128:57.91]nice nice
[129:04.22]I think this Mercy is doing pistol only and not healing.
[129:07.48]Oh boy.
[129:09.24]Alright, nice to see you.
[129:11.63]Good luck!
[129:12.09]Good luck!
[129:13.33]Your scream isn't going well right now
[129:27.91]He wanted to kill a man, that's important.
[129:38.44]What happened?
[129:41.80]And I didn't detonate it.
[129:45.86]Well, now I do.
[129:54.91]Alright, we're gonna get a kill.
[129:56.91]You spectating?
[129:58.51]Yeah.
[130:00.37]Didn't get a kill.
[130:03.20]No, you didn't.
[130:04.61]Yeah, go to the point.
[130:05.42]Go, go.
[130:06.34]It's your time to die.
[130:24.14]Yep.
[130:26.61]So what?
[130:27.15]We're going to lose in a minute.
[130:30.38]Versus the super team.
[130:32.03]No, it takes five minutes.
[130:34.62]The dream is fucking real.
[130:37.80]Hey, you're the guy that was just saying you didn't want to play Temple of Nubus 2.
[130:44.26]Didn't track any of those well at all.
[131:01.33]Ninja cap, ninja cap.
[131:07.98]I feel like Winston is winning the game right now.
[131:13.59]Everyone was so far extended like, yeah, get killed.
[131:16.30]Oh fuck it, it went way too early.
[131:17.63]Winston almost won the game.
[131:19.14]Just because he went to the point.
[131:21.73]Alright, we're gonna do a sneaky strategy.
[131:23.48]Are you watching?
[131:25.65]Let's go Good good good one.
[131:31.77]You're also dead because you did that like in the open.
[131:33.90]Oh
[131:34.93]Oh, yeah?
[131:36.19]Provide.
[131:47.50]You guys think I'm trying to just see a wish when you mistake How about that one?
[131:56.79]Critique that one hiding in plain sight
[132:05.21]We're gonna win the game.
[132:06.53]You guys are gonna win the game.
[132:08.66]I think I was the bad thing the whole time.
[132:12.42]Take that one.
[132:15.55]Why don't you critique this one?
[132:23.94]No.
[132:27.75]No.
[132:29.62]Hey, you were doing so good critiquing.
[132:42.10]I heard a tracer, weren't you?
[132:50.18]Oh no, not a microwave.
[132:54.28]Yeah, Tracer's killing her healer.
[132:57.27]I'm the pistol healer.
[132:58.33]You still have the pistol mercy too.
[133:00.97]Do we really?
[133:02.24]Oh shit, that's right.
[133:05.27]I forgot, there hasn't been one point of healing.
[133:08.14]I mean, no one was around you when you died anyway, so...
[133:13.08]Oh no.
[133:13.70]Well the odds are against you but Winston almost won the game for you already.
[133:24.70]Oh, here comes the sneaky tire.
[133:26.66]There's a teleporter behind the point.
[133:28.97]No one's dead, no one's gonna respawn.
[133:33.01]It's your team that was actually all dead.
[133:35.32]Winston's doing it again.
[133:38.96]Oh, my God, boys.
[133:40.09]The dream is fucking real.
[133:41.60]I just killed a fucking crazy man.
[133:44.23]Okay, I should really start to take this seriously because we might actually win.
[133:53.49]Time to be serious.
[133:54.78]No more fucking around.
[133:56.00]No more messing around.
[133:59.50]I'll play.
[134:01.05]I'll play the game now.
[134:08.87]That's what it looks like when he tries.
[134:10.39]No, no.
[134:11.78]Okay.
[134:12.65]Here we go.
[134:13.77]I'm going to go Reinhardt.
[134:19.65]That axe looks cool.
[134:22.04]No, don't.
[134:24.67]Ho ho ho!
[134:25.67]God, dude.
[134:27.59]How much extra damage?
[134:28.43]Like, what's the stats?
[134:29.48]There's a leg.
[134:30.77]No.
[134:38.92]See, the strategy here, guys, is you want to make sure you don't get, like, knocked.
[134:41.73]See?
[134:42.29]You make it just big enough to... What the fuck was that?
[134:46.23]No, really, what did that much damage to me in that room?
[134:48.86]McCree shot you in the back.
[134:54.98]Maybe it was a high noon, but I don't think he said high noon.
[134:57.29]I think he just got shot in the back.
[135:00.76]See, this is the strategy.
[135:02.11]Nobody can hit you, and you have it blocked.
[135:05.95]No one can hit you either way.
[135:08.55]Well, I guess Symmetra or the Fire Strike.
[135:12.17]I mean, you have a lot of teammates shooting through it.
[135:14.68]oh my god the tracer's like on my dick I think he's mad he's got pistol by a fucking mercy oh goodness
[135:26.29]We might actually be doing not terribly.
[135:32.41]No, I think this is more serious now because it was too close.
[135:37.56]Well, to be fair, our support is not healing.
[135:41.65]He's doing pistol man.
[135:46.27]I'm not, I'm not, that's not what, I'm just saying that that, that's, that is a, that is an absolute fact.
[135:51.21]Shut this one up!
[135:54.49]Oh wow.
[136:09.83]Come on, if they don't...
[136:12.36]If they don't take it seriously, I'm not gonna take it seriously either.
[136:14.69]Are you fucking kidding me, dude?
[136:19.72]Did he just do that ult to me?
[136:22.83]Did he do every move he had to me?
[136:25.96]He ulted me too?
[136:28.25]Oh, he ulted everybody.
[136:29.04]They were all good.
[136:30.35]Never mind.
[136:31.05]My life is also now complete.
[136:36.40]What is my spray on Reinhardt?
[136:40.05]Oh, it's the Lannister.
[136:47.12]Not even here.
[136:50.68]I'm having trouble getting out of your spawn now.
[136:57.50]I'm gonna rock out.
[137:04.54]It's so funny how you just were like, you know what?
[137:06.74]You had the prediction that this was going to go so wrong, but it didn't need to go so wrong.
[137:12.83]That's the point.
[137:14.47]It didn't need to be so wrong.
[137:16.44]I've won all gold medals every game this morning and we've won... How many games have we won?
[137:25.54]I have some gold medals.
[137:27.14]I'll take all the credit here.
[137:28.11]I've had plenty.
[137:30.07]we're just I'm just gonna Q and hope I hurt someone like right now
[137:45.95]Look at that, this is a front row seat.
[137:49.04]I mean, you did help bring them back to their defensive position.
[137:55.48]Thanks, Coach.
[138:14.92]Alright, watch this.
[138:17.41]Ready for this one?
[138:21.97]What the fuck?
[138:29.47]Imagine if I could just sneak up there.
[138:32.46]Oh, it ended.
[138:33.00]They didn't notice you.
[138:34.91]We gave it our all.
[138:37.42]Alright, get me out of here.
[138:40.10]Get me out of here.
[138:53.85]Oh boy.
[138:59.96]Oh, it doesn't show it.
[139:04.15]Bye.
[139:13.41]What?
[139:14.94]Alright, let's go.
[139:15.82]Do you want to queue against the full team of people again?
[139:19.33]No, I actually don't, and I really wish matchmaking would stop letting you do that.
[139:28.77]Was that a team of four or was that a team of six?
[139:32.71]At least four.
[139:34.03]Damn.
[139:41.74]I think it would normally be five, but Seagull wasn't there.
[139:47.22]In the solo queue.
[139:48.16]I hear it's called solo queue.
[139:50.75]Um...
[139:54.23]I chalk that up as, too, there's not enough people in the beta.
[139:57.86]So you have to play against those people.
[139:59.57]Well, no, that's the problem.
[140:00.29]There aren't enough people in the beta.
[140:01.84]If you're MMR.
[140:02.34]So why would you do that?
[140:03.14]If you have even a slightly high enough MMR to be put in a game like that, it's going to do it.
[140:08.47]From their perspective, why even set up a game like that?
[140:14.58]They probably have like a 1% like loss because who else at like 10 in the morning on a Sunday has a like four man try hard squad.
[140:24.07]I don't know.
[140:30.43]No, probably plenty of people.
[140:32.96]Probably them.
[140:43.86]Is this the 107 you were talking about?
[140:45.39]Because this guy's 107.
[140:50.57]I don't know.
[140:51.19]A couple people got to 100 now.
[140:53.78]207?
[140:54.14]Oh my god!
[141:00.06]All systems test out.
[141:00.50]Ready for combat maneuvers.
[141:08.14]Alright, who's not going to get it?
[141:09.59]Who's not going to get it?
[141:11.41]I'm going to wait and do it when we're out there.
[141:14.48]And let's go.
[141:17.91]Let's get him moving.
[141:32.48]Good pick, good pick.
[141:34.96]Reaper's behind us.
[141:39.83]Uh, did you kill him?
[141:42.12]No, he has a shadow ability.
[141:45.46]And somehow, oh.
[141:48.71]I was trying to get away from the ground and fly away or something.
[142:01.72]I must have an ult already.
[142:04.17]Jeez.
[142:16.76]I have an ult.
[142:18.04]Stick around.
[142:26.05]Get down!
[142:37.56]Ooh, you feel that?
[142:47.49]Audio ready, let's get the-
[143:07.20]How are you doing over there?
[143:08.88]Are you okay?
[143:10.40]I'm about to die.
[143:12.33]Suddenly...
[143:13.57]I don't know, I went from full health to just insta-dead in a second.
[143:28.76]Did I launch her off?
[143:32.23]Oh, they hopped right in.
[143:35.06]I have an ult again.
[143:36.23]We can just sprint in there.
[143:41.37]Where you at?
[143:50.26]Let's go and get a point.
[143:56.35]Anybody here?
[143:58.63]Ah, nobody was in there!
[144:31.62]I gotta wait for everybody I shouldn't have gone in.
[144:40.01]I just thought we could cap it there.
[144:47.80]Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh
[145:24.54]Far out, though.
[145:26.09]Somewhere.
[145:26.49]What the hell is she?
[145:27.85]Oh, she's over here on the right.
[145:31.81]Come on.
[145:31.99]Get the hell out of here.
[145:46.75]That Zarya shield is fucking crazy.
[145:50.68]Yep.
[145:51.43]It's pretty ridiculous on these maps too because it's just a mess.
[145:56.60]Revenge.
[146:08.77]They did have, yeah, they did have Asario.
[146:17.06]Let's up the tempo!
[146:19.67]I'm not playing Lúcio this round.
[146:24.50]What do we have?
[146:25.26]What do we got here?
[146:28.09]We need somebody to play, a character that can heal.
[146:32.01]But I don't want to do it.
[146:34.10]I don't want to do it.
[146:39.79]Let's switch to Lúcio.
[146:50.17]And you're the only tank.
[146:52.16]So, good luck.
[146:54.62]Thanks, but good luck.
[147:17.84]That guy just did so much damage to me.
[147:23.53]I turned around and shot him like twice.
[147:25.25]Didn't even fucking matter.
[147:27.14]A pyro?
[147:29.22]No, reaper.
[147:31.91]He just hit every single meat shot.
[147:33.84]That sucked.
[147:47.73]Trying to figure out what the fuck that's even... God.
[148:06.78]This Pharah is hitting me over and over again with a tepuri shot.
[148:27.35]Nope, nope, nope.
[148:29.02]I can't attack her.
[148:33.17]Ah.
[148:36.09]Goddamn.
[148:39.41]Remember when I said the thing about the character in the piano?
[148:41.99]I don't know, those of you guys will remember.
[148:45.91]There's a new character that I want stuffed in the fucking piano and thrown down the flight of stairs.
[148:51.23]It's Zarya.
[149:03.66]God.
[149:11.41]Give a Zarya 150 health, I think I'd still player.
[149:22.48]Are you serious?
[149:23.22]For a second I thought that was the enemy.
[149:26.79]I think we lost this one.
[149:30.31]Yeah.
[149:31.17]It's possible.
[149:36.11]It is possible.
[150:00.62]Well, that settles it.
[150:04.45]Just trying to stay alive.
[150:11.75]Somehow it's still not...
[150:13.89]I've selected Zarya's counter.
[150:15.95]What is it?
[150:18.81]Oh wow, somebody actually went on it Somebody actually stepped on it
[150:31.43]Ah, no.
[150:32.27]I'm just trying to be annoying and eat damage.
[150:42.38]I wonder what it was.
[150:51.26]My lord.
[151:09.75]That card's blue.
[151:16.76]Take a crane and attach a big giant, one of those big cartoon boulders on it, whatever they are.
[151:24.42]Smash Zarya's house.
[151:30.45]I'll leave game.
[151:30.97]I have a box to open.
[151:35.25]They play a game without me and maybe you'll win my game why cuz you have a like 10 million MMR
[151:46.98]And I have the bad juju.
[151:49.60]I'm gonna order food.
[151:50.76]No, we had some good games.
[151:54.69]There were some good games there.
[151:56.68]Did we win?
[151:58.28]Yeah.
[151:59.65]I don't remember winning.
[152:02.70]I think we won once on Numbani.
[152:05.27]uh we went on the that middle one right the one with like the king of the hill with the what's it called
[152:12.53]Nepal?
[152:14.02]Oh, yeah.
[152:14.99]Nepal, we did.
[152:15.81]I guess we won more than one game.
[152:23.14]A wrecking ball?
[152:23.92]Yeah, that's what it is.
[152:36.15]Maybe one or two more.
[152:38.10]I need to go finish a video.
[152:40.24]And hopefully get it up either today or tomorrow afternoon or something.
[152:50.40]Try playing this character.
[153:02.12]McCree, I want that skin.
[153:06.06]How much do you think skins are going to be when they actually release the game?
[153:10.21]I don't think you could buy skins.
[153:12.57]And you're totally buying boxes.
[153:15.00]Can you buy boxes or can you buy the currency?
[153:18.25]I think it's only going to be buying boxes.
[153:20.86]Really?
[153:23.17]that's kind of interesting I guess so you can't really
[153:30.58]Determine what you actually are gonna get even if you want to pay for it.
[153:34.49]That's interesting.
[153:38.28]I Wonder how much is gonna be per box?
[153:42.24]A dollar or something?
[153:44.58]Less than that?
[153:45.20]I feel like the boxes are easy enough to get by playing the game that it would be weird if they were more than a couple dollars.
[153:55.36]I dunno.
[153:57.91]Well, you'd have to be pretty desperate.
[154:00.31]buying boxes, because they are pretty easy to get.
[154:04.01]And there's nothing...
[154:06.16]There aren't even, like...
[154:08.41]PSGO, oh, I unboxed like a super knife that I can sell and it's like worth money.
[154:13.44]There's no trading.
[154:16.07]No, but still one.
[154:17.64]Those things have value if they're rare, I guess.
[154:20.28]I'm just saying people are going to complain that, oh, you can buy the socks.
[154:25.96]There's a lot of good reasons to not buy the boxes.
[154:29.78]True.
[154:30.76]And you don't have to.
[154:38.56]I'm gonna go the other way that way is too dangerous for me
[154:54.22]All the way around.
[154:59.32]I shot him in the head.
[155:01.78]I gave him an idea for trading.
[155:03.99]Holy shit people, blizzards are stupid.
[155:06.10]If I just gave them that idea.
[155:09.41]You guys have been working on this game for like, what, five years?
[155:17.95]I just got so startled.
[155:19.78]He just came in swinging.
[155:24.81]I could barely see.
[155:27.37]Hey Otto.
[155:39.77]Get on it!
[155:41.64]Is there a Bastion or something?
[155:43.18]No, it's just him.
[155:45.35]I think he's still alive.
[155:46.11]Let's see if I can catch this guy off guard.
[155:52.66]That was a risk because I thought he was not gonna have like full health.
[156:01.76]This life's never uneventful.
[156:17.76]But what food should I order, Cameron?
[156:19.55]I don't know, but there's nobody here.
[156:20.69]Everyone's dead.
[156:22.54]Oh.
[156:31.10]Kree's gonna be a hard sell here.
[156:45.53]Whoa, where is he?
[156:52.17]That was scary.
[156:56.94]I
[157:07.20]Oh, damn it.
[157:08.28]He got me right there?
[157:09.17]He just jumped right into that arrow.
[157:10.19]That sucked.
[157:14.76]I'm kind of alone over here.
[157:17.02]This is not a good place to be, I will say that for sure.
[157:29.64]I was looking in the wrong spot.
[157:32.70]Right in the face.
[157:45.44]Do we have a Genji?
[157:46.68]I dunno.
[157:55.80]None of those hit him.
[157:57.86]What kind of space station am I living on where that doesn't hit somebody?
[158:07.02]See ya.
[158:09.33]Little Roadhog behind.
[158:15.48]It might be time to switch.
[158:20.30]I got one more ult and I'm probably going to change.
[158:23.31]I need some more beef, I think.
[158:36.52]I just barely didn't get killed by that
[158:47.79]I thought there was going to be at least a person or two here.
[158:52.15]Please spam that corner.
[158:53.90]It really helps.
[158:54.54]Oh boy, that guy really is going.
[159:00.28]You Wraith.
[159:07.08]I'm gonna shadow play.
[159:08.88]You're gonna shadow play me?
[159:12.66]Can you do that?
[159:14.92]I'm gonna get touched and die.
[159:17.93]Please, I just want health.
[159:24.95]No, please, I just want help.
[159:26.14]I don't even want to fight this guy.
[159:28.97]Oh, please.
[159:29.71]I don't want to.
[159:30.21]I don't want to.
[159:30.69]I don't want to.
[159:32.81]I told you I didn't want to.
[159:34.15]I didn't want to do it.
[159:35.32]I told you.
[159:37.79]I don't want to do this again.
[159:39.56]I don't want to do this again.
[159:41.41]Do it again.
[159:44.07]Just give it, give it, please.
[159:54.87]Hey, we're doing fine.
[160:05.18]Can I get like one person with a high noon?
[160:11.93]Can that happen?
[160:19.84]I got one.
[160:22.44]I'm okay with that.
[160:29.65]Come on.
[160:32.48]Come on.
[160:36.18]I snuck up on you.
[160:41.51]Oh my goodness gracious.
[160:42.96]If I only was not a stupid, dummy, dumb idiot boy.
[160:46.12]I would have killed that Zenyatta.
[160:57.81]Shit.
[160:58.56]Where is he?
[161:00.10]You're dead.
[161:03.46]What?
[161:03.82]Was he up?
[161:04.32]Oh, he's on top of me.
[161:07.80]He fell down and just Batman'd me.
[161:09.89]He just did the thing you do in Arkham Knight.
[161:14.97]I just got Arkham Knighted.
[161:17.62]Was one of those goons.
[161:36.64]I gotta change.
[161:38.75]To what exactly though is the question?
[161:42.65]No, I'm gonna stay.
[161:45.74]I mean, this is...
[161:47.41]I'm gonna stay.
[161:50.63]You just gotta stop being such a coward.
[161:53.57]no it's just we're yeah I wouldn't have stayed McCree personally in my opinion good shot good shot good shot
[162:11.89]I need to get heals.
[162:17.69]I like heals.
[162:26.58]There's a creeper behind.
[162:36.09]Wow.
[162:36.72]Oh, it's right for him!
[162:40.34]Man.
[162:41.16]Batman.
[162:47.45]Maybe if he wasn't Wraithpump, I actually may have been able to kill him.
[162:57.22]Let's get the cap.
[162:57.99]We can do it.
[162:58.55]I have faith in you guys.
[163:00.64]Come on.
[163:06.27]Weird, spectating you doesn't give hit markers.
[163:09.44]So, like, when you're shooting someone like that, it's just like, wow.
[163:12.37]Like, what?
[163:12.99]You can't hit any of them.
[163:14.48]That is really weird.
[163:30.06]Holy shit.
[163:32.31]It's a dragon!
[163:33.27]Cabot!
[163:33.46]Cabot!
[163:34.02]Cabot!
[163:34.54]Cabot!
[163:37.19]Come on, we're so close.
[163:41.06]We're so close We're so close Do we?
[163:46.46]They're just contesting with the diva I think yeah, we did it but now we also when you die I get like the From your dead body camera.
[163:54.21]Oh, really?
[163:55.36]I don't see kill cam, so I got to see the cart.
[163:59.03]You know, I got all this.
[163:59.89]You know, I could fly around the map and help you, like, tell you who's around the corner.
[164:03.13]Oh, no screen-shading.
[164:04.92]No, we're going to screen cheat.
[164:05.77]No screen cheating.
[164:06.65]I don't want to know.
[164:07.09]No, you actually can.
[164:12.53]Unless I don't know how to do it.
[164:14.25]Sure that's intentional.
[164:20.23]Yeah, that would be pretty awful.
[164:22.08]Yeah, that would be very bad.
[164:24.76]Hey, around this corner, right there.
[164:28.51]Yeah, get him, get him, get him, get him.
[164:30.53]Yeah!
[164:31.81]Raid boss down.
[164:32.68]Push that card.
[164:33.56]Times three, times three.
[164:34.71]Let's go.
[164:35.15]I'm actually playing Wind Rider.
[164:38.17]Watch out for dragons dude.
[164:43.69]Yeah, just zone him out with that Q.
[164:45.74]Just zone him out with the Q. Oh, you guys.
[164:48.96]Oh, I didn't get him.
[164:57.52]Well, that was unfortunate.
[165:01.23]What a shielder, man.
[165:02.38]That was unfortunate.
[165:04.95]What do you- did he- what- bopped you back?
[165:07.24]Yeah, you gotta jump right- yeah, you gotta jump right.
[165:11.54]Here, coach.
[165:13.67]He's supposed to be coaching me.
[165:15.44]Keep it up.
[165:15.80]Keep up the good.
[165:16.24]Watch out for tires.
[165:17.36]Where is it?
[165:17.99]No, it's down.
[165:18.77]Tires down.
[165:19.15]What you're going to want to do is you're going to want to shoot people in the head.
[165:22.02]Every shot's a headshot.
[165:23.66]I don't know if I can do that, sir.
[165:30.43]Oh, no.
[165:31.01]I don't know if I can do that, sir.
[165:32.12]I don't know.
[165:32.62]I don't know.
[165:35.69]I got hit with that one rocket.
[165:39.03]And it killed me.
[165:42.87]What am I going?
[165:48.91]Oh, your whole team died.
[165:49.95]I don't know what to do.
[165:52.27]Yeah.
[165:54.77]I think it was the difference between you walking out of the wrong spawn door.
[165:58.09]No.
[165:58.79]No, you would have been there.
[166:00.80]No, that's not true.
[166:04.47]That would have been a good one to go out on too.
[166:12.80]Oh no, it's the Batman.
[166:14.61]No, that wasn't the Batman.
[166:16.58]That wasn't Batman coming down from the rafters and killing every oblivious person?
[166:21.44]No.
[166:26.44]Three minutes on the edge.
[166:27.37]I didn't even get a card.
[166:29.10]I had like 20 final blows.
[166:36.12]It was my card.
[166:46.82]How are those stats looking?
[166:49.92]What would be your ideal hat to get out of one of those?
[166:54.65]Alright, this is my last one.
[166:56.72]Last one.
[166:58.75]And then I'm going to go take Otto for a walk, get something to eat, and try to finish a video.
[167:06.67]It's been real, guys.
[167:07.29]Thanks for coming out to the stream.
[167:09.08]Hope you guys are enjoying.
[167:09.86]Overwatch.
[167:14.94]You're in this game.
[167:19.36]Did you just solo queue and get into this game?
[167:22.83]No, it's when you spectate someone after people leave.
[167:25.72]It actually puts you on a team.
[167:29.08]because there isn't like a spectate there's a join game and you're kind of just waiting for someone to leave
[167:39.52]What if I not?
[167:40.09]I'm gonna play something I haven't played.
[167:43.05]I played Genji.
[167:45.30]Played him.
[167:45.82]Played her.
[167:47.05]I haven't played him, but I don't like playing him.
[167:49.76]Don't like me playing him.
[167:52.31]No.
[167:55.33]I'm going to play Bastion.
[167:56.90]I played Hanzo, Junkrat, Mei, Torbjörn, Widowmaker.
[168:04.03]I guess I've kind of played everybody, but on principle, I won't play Zarya.
[168:10.05]I just don't like the character.
[168:12.46]I've done pretty much everything.
[168:14.69]I'm just gonna fucking do Mei again for fun.
[168:17.88]Because she's fun to play.
[168:22.98]And I have the creamsicle outfit.
[168:27.63]You have to play Mei if you have the creamsicle outfit.
[168:29.60]Come on.
[168:37.67]Oh my god.
[168:38.82]You're on the other team.
[168:39.62]Hey, we get to play against each other for the final game.
[168:44.22]Aren't you happy?
[168:47.38]Or are you going to crash out?
[168:50.42]It's just going to take me a second to not die.
[168:58.16]I gotta pee so bad, too.
[169:03.73]I don't have 60 seconds.
[169:05.82]You're gonna have fun.
[169:07.43]I'm just gonna try and give you the most fun game you've ever played.
[169:10.58]Why?
[169:10.80]Are you playing with good players?
[169:13.62]Are those good players?
[169:18.70]Why are you saying that to me?
[169:21.29]Look, I gotta pee real bad.
[169:22.29]Don't fuck with me right now.
[169:30.68]Why are you being so silent?
[169:33.97]What are you doing?
[169:38.01]Can you just meet me at the Star Fox plane?
[169:42.09]Meet me at the Smash Brothers stage, please.
[169:45.39]Corneria, whatever it's called.
[169:49.46]Or the was it the lilac system with this I'm really hungry man Five four three two one
[169:59.05]Stop the payload.
[170:26.99]uh what you snuck through there oh for the love of god forget about you I thought I was gonna block her off
[170:56.05]God, you are so annoying.
[170:57.20]You are so annoying!
[171:03.41]Somebody please kill the Tracer.
[171:05.58]She's gonna give me an aneurysm.
[171:13.89]Which is, which is... How to have a fun game.
[171:18.80]I haven't even been able to freeze anybody.
[171:43.32]And he lives through that somehow.
[171:47.22]Some magical fucking way.
[171:49.73]Alright, correct me if I'm wrong.
[171:50.98]I want the people watching right now.
[171:52.99]Those icicles I was shooting were not hitting him in the head?
[171:56.24]I have had that problem as well.
[171:57.97]That doesn't make any sense.
[171:58.79]It used to be because that maze ice came out of the bottom right, but it doesn't do that anymore.
[172:04.68]I was almost certain that those were hitting him directly in the face.
[172:10.94]Apparently not, though.
[172:26.55]All gold.
[172:27.66]All gold!
[172:29.49]Good.
[172:32.98]You can't go anywhere.
[172:46.56]You're not getting away with me.
[172:59.84]You know what?
[173:02.76]We're doing a little bit of a fun thing here, guys.
[173:12.92]Told you it'd be fun.
[173:18.61]Alright, that would have been one for the books if I would have killed him right there.
[173:22.91]I hit him with two beautiful shots and it didn't even matter.
[173:27.03]That would've been, like, play of the game for me, personally.
[173:39.79]We will quickly.
[173:54.92]That would have been one for the books.
[174:03.51]Why did I just repeat that again?
[174:05.37]I ran out of things to say.
[174:09.50]Yeah, I guess that's true.
[174:16.29]That's too bad, man.
[174:17.85]I know the struggle when you stream for two hours.
[174:23.63]That was in the head.
[174:24.50]Make sure that one didn't miss.
[174:29.87]Sniper it's close This person doing
[174:48.79]Hey guys, I'm coming to visit you.
[174:56.79]See?
[174:57.19]See?
[174:57.49]What the fuck is going on?
[174:59.00]What the fuck was that?
[175:00.52]Okay, I am very mad at Blizzard.
[175:02.09]Blizzard Entertainment, what the hell was that?
[175:05.52]I want an explanation.
[175:07.33]from Mr. Blizzard.
[175:10.94]We all saw that.
[175:11.85]The evidence was there.
[175:15.69]I think this is just evidence that whatever team I'm on loses.
[175:35.18]Yep.
[175:48.73]No one can hide from my side.
[175:51.13]Thanks, Widowmaker.
[175:51.91]You've added a lot to this conversation.
[175:58.04]He's got a mask.
[175:59.91]He has a damage mask.
[176:02.31]He has the thing from Binding of Isaac that prevents all forward damage from hitting him.
[176:13.91]Don't you dare stick me.
[176:15.27]You stuck me.
[176:19.15]Try melee instead of fire?
[176:20.31]Well, if those hit him in the face, they would kill him in like two hits.
[176:24.18]I'd be sitting there punching him in the stomach all day.
[176:26.17]Holy shit, she revived him.
[176:51.94]Hmmmm...
[176:57.93]You guys actually got it.
[177:01.58]That's too bad.
[177:10.96]I was like, that person was kind of just standing there.
[177:33.10]Aww, I'm just barely missing you.
[177:39.24]I'm just barely missing you.
[177:44.39]I'm freaking out right now
[177:54.68]Did he just pull me in the freeze?
[177:57.36]Oh my god!
[178:04.15]I got scattered arrows by every arrow.
[178:11.70]I could have had 800 health and still died.
[178:14.14]I'm alive!
[178:20.76]Screw you.
[178:27.29]What's going on over there?
[178:45.31]Hi, Star.
[178:59.74]Okay.
[179:05.83]How bad are we losing right now?
[179:08.45]Yeah, we kind of just won.
[179:21.30]Okay.
[179:24.56]That was... That's what it's like to be on the other team.
[179:28.15]I know, really.
[179:30.02]Play of the game.
[179:35.11]Yeah, that is what it's like to be on the other team.
[179:43.29]Yep.
[179:43.83]Good play.
[179:45.59]He snuck down on him.
[179:51.75]You got a Zarya?
[179:54.50]You got a Zarya card?
[179:56.13]How did you have a Zarya card?
[179:59.15]I have five gold medals.
[180:00.82]It's not like, oh, five gold medals.
[180:02.80]You played Zarya for one life in the first minute of the game.
[180:07.00]Congratulations.
[180:13.06]I like forgot I even played Zarya that game.
[180:17.50]Alright, I gotta go.
[180:19.28]Before I pee my pants.
[180:20.71]You can't leave on a loss that bad.
[180:23.72]Hey, you lost that game.
[180:26.23]I didn't lose that one.
[180:28.58]How about you start streaming?
[180:30.03]It's around the time you would start.
[180:31.52]No, I'm already not having any fun playing.
[180:33.85]Well, you already got it out of your system.
[180:35.36]Now you're going to be playing.
[180:38.98]I don't want to answer the is Tracer a good character question for the next couple hours.
[180:43.86]It was fun playing with you, though.
[180:45.42]No, it was fun.
[180:46.43]There was a couple times when I was...
[180:48.78]A little bit upset about things.
[180:50.71]You know, that happens.
[180:52.05]To the best of us, right?
[180:56.15]Um...
[180:58.03]Yeah, take it easy, guys.
[181:00.53]Thanks for coming.
[181:03.60]Thanks for the new subs.
[181:06.01]I know I probably missed some because I'm a terrible person.
[181:10.14]But take it easy.
[181:11.67]Bye-bye.
