[ve:60.16.100]

[00:10.70]There's another one to my right.
[00:11.68]There you go.
[00:14.58]There's more.
[00:15.06]There's another guy coming.
[00:17.36]Yeah, I got to get rid of this default sniper rifle.
[00:24.41]This thing is like... Yeah, we should be able to get some new ones soon.
[00:29.99]I bought one from that store.
[00:31.03]Open that mouth.
[00:31.55]There it is.
[00:32.11]Open your mouth.
[00:33.73]I bought one from that store.
[00:38.32]Yeah, oh, watch out.
[00:39.10]These guys are coming from all over the place now.
[00:40.82]Oh.
[00:40.88]Critical.
[00:49.83]Here, get the health vial.
[00:52.29]I got, I got, I need a, I got.
[00:54.01]Oh, there's a repeater on the ground.
[00:56.57]Um.
[00:58.55]Less recoil.
[00:59.39]I'll take that.
[00:59.83]I'm going to put, this thing I'm using right now is just plain.
[01:02.53]Oh, there's another one right here.
[01:03.59]Let me take a look at that one.
[01:07.54]Take a look at that one.
[01:08.58]I might take this one.
[01:09.28]What do you think?
[01:12.64]Yeah, take it.
[01:13.05]The one I have is similar.
[01:16.57]Whatever.
[01:16.97]It has a worse sight, but I like iron sights better.
[01:22.15]Personally, in this game, I don't like the scopes that much.
[01:26.61]You know, I can't really use iron sights.
[01:28.81]I'm terrible.
[01:29.69]Call of Duty, bad company.
[01:31.23]Open your mouth for me.
[01:34.80]all do you think so do this I'm just jumping he's he's about their body all he dropped a gun or he dropped something nice maybe not just cheap repeater well drop this one's a little bit better I'll take it yeah I think I mean worst-case scenario we can always solve them
[01:57.64]I think we have item specializations or something.
[02:02.12]I'm pretty certain that I use sniper rifles and revolvers, I think it said.
[02:07.57]I'm not sure what you used.
[02:08.53]I didn't pay attention to the character screen.
[02:10.35]There are skill sets we get.
[02:11.55]At level 5, we get skill sets, and then we can upgrade, and we can go in a certain direction.
[02:15.73]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:17.57]Look at all these guns that just came out of the grave.
[02:19.57]I'm going to take the SMG.
[02:22.48]What is this?
[02:24.42]It's a sniper rifle.
[02:28.60]Sorry to just completely freak out right there, but anyways, what were you saying?
[02:34.64]I forgot.
[02:35.18]Alright, let's just move on.
[02:37.92]I'm going to use the lady finger.
[02:40.66]When they start to get named is when you start to know that it's good stuff.
[02:50.49]God, this thing is powerful.
[02:53.09]Yeah, they had green letters.
[02:55.17]Green is good.
[02:56.91]Holy shit, this shit is powerful.
[02:58.47]This stuff is great.
[02:59.29]I'm not even going to use the sniper rifle, dude.
[03:02.21]I'm going to keep using this thing.
[03:06.30]This thing is amazing.
[03:08.36]They don't stand a chance.
[03:10.02]No, then we get to a boss and it's like, fuck.
[03:12.24]Yeah, and we both just get destroyed.
[03:16.14]But yeah, I mean, we're tearing it up.
[03:17.74]Ooh, really?
[03:18.97]A real challenge?
[03:24.13]you know what I think that is what is hidden my accuracy with this gun is bad they gotta be close so we should buy a little bit of health what's the deal of the day uh... very slow health regeneration I'm just not going to say health and I mean time of the day item item item of the time of the day not intentional
[03:53.31]Alright, I got full health now.
[03:54.78]So, I think... Here, ready?
[03:57.28]Headshot that guy, the bandit killer on the opposite side of the bridge.
[04:00.34]Alright, let me see if I can do that with this turret.
[04:01.74]Alright, I'm going for the one with the shield.
[04:05.23]The one that's facing him.
[04:06.75]Alright, go, go.
[04:07.45]Shit.
[04:08.03]What the hell?
[04:09.05]Oh, I missed.
[04:09.89]I missed.
[04:11.53]Now that this rifle is too inaccurate and too far away.
[04:13.71]I'm going to use the pistol.
[04:15.65]Get the guy in the back.
[04:16.35]In the back.
[04:16.72]In the back.
[04:17.10]He doesn't have shields.
[04:26.11]Here we go.
[04:27.01]Oh, I threw a nade.
[04:30.41]This thing is so damn inaccurate, I'm getting headshots all over the place.
[04:34.25]Just on accident headshots.
[04:36.65]You get more experience from headshots too, I think.
[04:39.71]Really?
[04:40.47]Yeah, I think the more, if you do like a critical attack, like a critical hit, I believe you get more damage and more experience.
[04:48.34]No, more damage obviously, what am I talking about?
[04:51.74]I believe if you get a critical hit, you do more damage.
[04:55.71]Leveled up.
[04:56.69]Leveled up, suckas.
[04:58.43]I can get the skill thing now.
[05:00.71]I didn't level up.
[05:02.21]Okay, okay.
[05:02.87]My next thing is I can increase the capacity of my shield using D.Va.
[05:07.82]Or striking your melee attacks can daze enemies, reducing their movement, speed, and accuracy.
[05:13.44]Increase your fire rate with all weapons.
[05:15.96]Spark, increase your chance of causing elemental effects with elemental weapons.
[05:21.16]Increase your critical hit damage with Slayer.
[05:23.76]Silent Resolve increases your resistance to damage for a few seconds after phase walking.
[05:28.20]That sounds useful.
[05:29.96]yeah I mean I would definitely pick that one so now I have an action skill which I'm gonna try out I kinda read up on it that when I kinda go invisible and then when I go out of it I receive I damage the people around me so let's test it out on I believe when we drop down we're gonna encounter a boss so I'll go down I'll activate it and then I'll go behind him and try and get headshots yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna stay back and just try and pick him off let's go down
[05:57.89]Oh, yeah.
[05:59.21]Who dis?
[05:59.77]We got lights coming on.
[06:01.49]First boss.
[06:03.01]He just woke up.
[06:03.67]He should be weak.
[06:04.43]Oh, damn.
[06:05.11]Safety first.
[06:06.01]He has three balls.
[06:06.89]Also, he has three balls.
[06:09.08]Let's go.
[06:09.48]Oh, wow.
[06:11.30]100 mile per hour run right there for you.
[06:15.80]Oh, you got him.
[06:18.06]Oh, man.
[06:18.60]Headshots.
[06:19.16]Headshots all day.
[06:20.36]Oh, shit.
[06:21.76]Headshots all day.
[06:23.67]Help me with these guys.
[06:24.57]Oh, shit.
[06:28.21]These guys take a lot of damage.
[06:29.89]Oh my god, I'm coming.
[06:31.53]Here, wait, let me get a kill.
[06:37.47]There, when I get a kill, it gives me health.
[06:40.87]That's good, because yeah, I think it reminds me of, like I said, Left 4 Dead, where I think if I'm getting damaged, I can't lift you up.
[06:48.16]There's a lot of stuff on the ground.
[06:52.00]There's mad money on the ground.
[06:54.66]Mad weapons.
[06:55.42]What was that, a clipper?
[06:57.10]Yeah, this thing shoots fire, I think.
[06:59.63]Yeah, see, it lights the ground on fire when you shoot it.
[07:02.31]Oh, damn.
[07:05.35]I'm pretty much full with it.
[07:06.33]Some weapons have additional elemental energy built in.
[07:09.95]Oh, that's cool.
[07:10.99]Here, I'm gonna just open up some toilets and grab some stuff out.
[07:13.90]No big deal.
[07:16.58]What do we have in here?
[07:18.84]Oh, oh, oh, hello, weapons.
[07:21.32]Sniper.
[07:22.60]Oh.
[07:22.74]SPR-11 Terrible Shotgun.
[07:27.00]Does it have to say terrible in the description?
[07:29.12]That's kind of discouraging.
[07:31.04]Here, take my terrible stuff.
[07:33.22]I don't want it.
[07:34.11]You can have it.
[07:35.67]Everybody's happy then.
[07:37.33]We could totally make a pun about these toilets.
[07:41.01]Like, oh, I'm just getting some shit out of the toilet.
[07:42.77]Hold on.
[07:43.07]Yeah, I got it.
[07:44.71]Oh, yes.
[07:45.19]I got a much needed health vial from that.
[07:48.82]That must have been the fastest boss kill in all games.
[07:51.08]You know why?
[07:52.05]Because I'm Link.
[07:53.83]In girl form.
[07:56.35]As a guy.
[07:57.61]Playing him.
[07:59.35]Link, in my opinion, already is a girl.
[08:01.58]Oh, no.
[08:02.40]Did I just say that?
[08:03.66]Oh, snap.
[08:05.18]Oh, hell to the no.
[08:07.02]You did not just say that, sucker.
[08:10.68]I can't even equipped I'd be level five all stuff and my name means I'm a butterfly this is this is this is certainly only got more you know more peterson stuff uh... I'm not looking all around chest so well substandard us and see the damage goes down but the accuracy goes up Iraq's this one along alongside with it releasing just shotgun shells yeah I'm sick of it
[08:37.83]I mean, just pick up, might as well pick up everything, man.
[08:39.73]You can always sell it.
[08:41.49]Shoot that, Holmes.
[08:42.45]For mad dope.
[08:45.79]We do it.
[08:49.31]Oh, did you grab the shotgun?
[08:51.03]Yeah, I grabbed it.
[08:52.03]Do you want it?
[08:52.93]No, I'm good.
[08:53.94]You can have the terrible shotgun.
[08:56.34]My pleasure.
[08:57.08]Here, let's try and walk on.
[08:58.94]One, two, three.
[09:00.98]Oh, nice.
[09:02.02]Nice.
[09:03.86]Let's get out of here.
[09:06.38]Oh yeah, we found the gun stash.
[09:09.72]Mad guns.
[09:10.91]We blowin' money fast.
[09:12.99]Who's that?
[09:13.49]I don't even know who that's by.
[09:15.05]Yeah, neither do I. I'm so far out of the music scene, man, it's not even funny.
[09:22.83]Alright, let me see.
[09:26.18]I want to test out my money here.
[09:29.49]Let me test my money.
[09:32.03]Let me play the stocks for a little while.
[09:36.04]Oh, oh, oh, oh, hello.
[09:44.52]I think I'm going to buy a new shield.
[09:47.68]I need some help here, though.
[09:49.56]Oh, wait, there's people here?
[09:50.34]Yeah.
[09:51.76]Oh, wow, there are.
[09:52.49]Alright, I'll come up there.
[10:02.69]I got on the war well how do I all this this is a shot and I get it okay my health is low it's not good think we just have to turn this in so if we don't get completely and totally ambushed I think will be alright will be going to disappear now watch out there's a lot of that we're gonna have to cross over there no way I'll just talk to me they're good idea to change how do you program effort g
[10:33.83]Cool.
[10:34.63]Oh, we got guys coming around on the side.
[10:36.01]Oh, they're not getting up here.
[10:39.19]Whoa!
[10:39.59]In your face!
[10:42.87]Well, talk about, like, swallowing my words.
[10:45.63]Oh, man.
[10:55.37]Got your back, buddy.
[11:05.72]Oh, critical.
[11:06.84]They're coming around for you.
[11:11.80]Kind of like the shotgun.
[11:13.38]Explosive sticky.
[11:15.24]Grenade damage amplifier or some shit.
[11:17.78]So it's a new grenade or something?
[11:19.38]I don't know.
[11:19.70]Oh yeah, you received the grenade mod.
[11:21.77]Grenade mods, damn it.
[11:24.57]Oh, did you skip the, uh... The one time the thing doesn't stay up for long.
[11:30.99]I think it's something you attach to the grenades.
[11:36.03]I think that's what the little robot freak just said.
[11:38.73]Oh, shit.
[11:39.37]Oh, God.
[11:40.54]They're in the air.
[11:41.14]Alright, that gun is just not going to work.
[11:44.94]Going with the heavy artillery.
[11:49.20]Oh, I just took these guys out, so...
[11:53.31]That was a golden.
[11:54.03]Come around for me.
[11:55.97]Oh, wait, don't shoot him.
[11:58.61]Oh, I just completely stole your thunder.
[12:01.97]That's dumb.
[12:03.44]I would have hit him.
[12:05.18]That's bull.
[12:05.76]I wanted to do my sexy attack.
[12:11.22]That would have been really cool.
[12:13.22]Where do we have to go here?
[12:14.62]I think we just have to turn it in.
[12:16.32]Just drop down here?
[12:18.27]Wherever that blind guy was.
[12:21.71]TK Baja.
[12:22.86]Yeah, wherever that Baja Fresh guy was.
[12:26.64]Props to anybody that gets the joke that I just said.
[12:30.74]I don't get it.
[12:31.96]I feel left out right now.
[12:33.22]Let's see, a reinforced thermal shield.
[12:40.00]I can buy this one.
[12:41.14]It has fire resistance.
[12:43.34]I'm sure you're gonna need that somewhere down the road.
[12:48.36]So the capacity is the amount of damage you can take, I'm assuming, right?
[12:52.30]Yeah.
[12:53.17]And the recharge rate, oh wow.
[12:54.99]Yeah, this one is 118 capacity, and my current one is 50.
[12:59.13]But this one, the only thing the thermal shield has over it is fire resistance.
[13:05.31]I mean, I might as well go for it.
[13:06.43]I mean, it's a good deal.
[13:08.49]Yeah, I just bought one of the other shields, just because... I'm going to sell away my other stuff, though.
[13:14.89]Alright, let's see.
[13:15.61]Alright, I got to put this skill point in.
[13:21.84]Yeah, get that in there, man.
[13:23.08]Bloodwing, gain the ability to send your pet Bloodwing out to attack an enemy and then return.
[13:29.71]Oh, chuck that.
[13:30.53]Chuck that.
[13:31.21]Let's see what this thing does.
[13:32.65]F. Oh, damn.
[13:35.17]Look at that.
[13:36.55]Fly.
[13:37.11]You can shoot him down.
[13:40.15]So does it, like, just attack people?
[13:41.99]Yeah, it should.
[13:42.71]I mean, that's pretty cool.
[13:44.88]So what are we going to name that thing, then?
[13:46.40]It's got to have a name.
[13:47.78]I don't know, but it's pretty damn cool.
[13:49.32]I like it.
[13:50.41]We'll figure a name out sooner or later for that thing.
[13:54.93]Alright, I think I'm all set in regards to... Let's get out of here.
[13:58.37]Yeah, let's just go turn this in.
[13:59.99]To the arid badlands of sexy times.
[14:03.87]Two... What?
[14:07.22]Oh, wow, I just activated my skill point thing by accident.
[14:11.02]I was gonna use sexy time in your face with my... My purple sexy times.
[14:18.93]Oh no, but I still have my skill point.
[14:20.69]That's cool.
[14:22.15]Yeah, I just kind of want to sprint past all these guys.
[14:24.77]You want my face?
[14:28.38]Oh, you just totally blew that guy's face off.
[14:30.48]Completely.
[14:32.30]I think they have a weakness against fire.
[14:33.92]Yeah, because when you light them up, they just explode.
[14:41.49]These guys are three hit shots.
[14:44.13]Yeah.
[14:46.11]that gun, whatever you got right there, man, is a keeper.
[14:50.29]Beautiful.
[14:51.01]I love it.
[14:53.27]I still have that gun I'm using for level 6.
[14:55.85]I should compare that.
[14:58.65]Let's just get past these guys.
[14:59.71]Oh, damn, we have to go up.
[15:00.53]Stop.
[15:01.42]Come here.
[15:03.78]Oh, actually, now I can use that new sniper rifle.
[15:06.50]I'm going to put it on.
[15:07.62]Watch out.
[15:08.02]I got you.
[15:09.98]I'm in my inventory being a real idiot.
[15:13.46]okay where is it one two there we go there we go now I have an actual knot
