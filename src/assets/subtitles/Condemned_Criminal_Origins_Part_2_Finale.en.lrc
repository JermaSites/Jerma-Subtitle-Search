[01:43.26]Hey.
[01:45.38]How you doing everybody?
[01:46.48]Right off the bat, we've got a problem right off the bat.
[01:49.94]My internet is fluctuating up and down here.
[01:54.58]Don't ask me why.
[01:55.54]It is.
[01:56.92]I'm just kind of waiting this out a little for like a minute or two.
[02:03.42]Dropping frames and all that great stuff.
[02:08.66]Comcast.com Whatever their name is.
[02:12.76]Whatever that, like, company's name is.
[02:15.52]Just give me a minute.
[02:17.36]I'll be right back.
[02:17.89]I'm gonna make a tweet.
[02:19.31]I could change the title, too.
[02:20.95]The title is so wrong.
[02:23.09]It shouldn't be that.
[02:23.81]We made that joke last night.
[02:24.85]Can't do that again.
[02:26.41]Give me a minute.
[02:27.52]One second.
[03:20.17]Let me change the title now.
[03:23.89]Something interesting.
[03:24.59]How about... What's a joke from last night?
[03:34.88]How about Locker Room?
[03:37.72]Locker Room Man.
[03:39.04]No, that's awful.
[03:42.89]Grab anything.
[03:48.70]Dead birds.
[03:51.24]Grab anything?
[03:53.28]Fuck, my internet is dying right now.
[03:54.84]This sucks.
[03:55.76]Why?
[03:58.76]I feel like this is going to be an issue all night.
[04:03.97]Grab anything.
[04:06.07]I think I'm going to have to keep it grab anything.
[04:10.39]Grab anything comma survive the psychos.
[04:16.87]I like it.
[04:23.77]bathroom battles.
[04:29.31]I'm just sitting there.
[04:30.01]I'm trying to kill as much time as possible.
[04:32.05]I'm trying to hold off starting.
[04:40.48]I have run my stream at 4,000.
[04:42.72]Okay, be a sec.
[04:45.32]Right?
[04:45.86]So my bitrate's 4,000.
[04:48.84]And I'm looking over here and it's at 4,000 and this shit is going 4,000, 3,100, 2,000, 2,000, 21, 21, 21, 4,000.
[04:54.25]It's just, yeah.
[04:56.77]This is not good.
[05:03.66]Let's just see what happens.
[05:04.86]You guys let me know if you see any bad frame drops.
[05:06.74]Because that's already irritating.
[05:11.02]I haven't even started.
[05:14.08]Anyways, thank you, Clint.
[05:17.72]Hold on.
[05:18.29]Get that up there.
[05:21.05]We need audio, don't we?
[05:23.65]Yes, we do.
[05:24.95]Turn that off.
[05:27.39]You can see that now.
[05:28.37]Okay, let's hope this works.
[05:33.97]Load game.
[05:34.57]We were right here.
[05:35.21]Anyways, thank you.
[05:40.48]I thought it was Clint.
[05:41.48]No, his name is Chin.
[05:43.49]Thank you Chin TF for $5.
[05:46.11]Thank God it's Friday.
[05:47.58]Happy Friday night, by the way.
[05:49.64]It is Friday.
[05:52.86]Thank you for the $5.
[05:53.88]Happy Friday.
[05:54.74]Thank you also to Night Fang for the $1.
[05:56.60]I already answered that question in the name of the genie.
[05:59.48]Am I going to play this all night?
[06:01.86]Yes.
[06:03.32]Bear, if there's anything wrong with the internet here, I plan on beating Condemned tonight.
[06:08.16]It's probably like another three or four hours in the game, I assume.
[06:11.98]I don't think the game is more than 8 to 10 hours long.
[06:13.98]We played for about 5 hours last night, so I can assume we should be able to finish it tonight.
[06:20.88]Also, thank you to Molotov Bartender.
[06:25.64]I'm sorry for baiting you, but I really do feel short.
[06:27.70]At 5.11, I'm the runt of my entire family.
[06:30.28]Alright, look.
[06:35.22]Do you see the funny rats?
[06:36.28]What's going on with my screen?
[06:40.52]This doesn't look right.
[06:43.92]This does not, that does not look right at all.
[06:46.02]That didn't look like it looked like yesterday.
[06:50.21]Holy shit, guys, we got 60 FPS!
[06:52.59]What's going on here?
[06:54.11]You see this?
[06:58.03]No wonder it looks different.
[06:59.07]We're running at 60 frames a second, not 30.
[07:06.18]And fucking my internet keeps, like, shitting itself.
[07:09.02]Ugh!
[07:11.44]Oh, now we're back down to 30, though.
[07:15.36]Oh, god damn it.
[07:17.02]I just saw, like, the face of God for five seconds, and then he left us.
[07:22.56]Oh, well.
[07:29.79]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[07:34.76]Okay, easy.
[07:41.01]gonna stick with this uh so the story so far from my understanding is a bunch of psychos a bunch of people doing drugs doing drugs don't do those they get too many drugs in their system and then they call in the police I'm the police I came in I took some names I kicked some ass and I chewed some bubble gum ran out of that gum you know what I'm saying but I was able to find out the story of how
[08:06.60]The world is going crazy.
[08:09.80]That was that easy?
[08:12.04]That was that easy to open this door?
[08:13.30]Okay.
[08:15.00]Apparently they think I'm a murderer.
[08:16.52]They think I'm a psycho.
[08:18.35]It's just not true.
[08:19.17]I'll take that to the grave.
[08:20.21]Not true.
[08:24.57]And now I'm inside of the museum trying to find the artifact to prove my innocence.
[08:29.91]Because there's an artifact kind of like in Ghostbusters 2.
[08:32.45]There's a painting.
[08:33.75]Wait, who the fuck is that?
[08:37.16]See you later.
[08:44.24]Nothing in this room.
[08:47.76]What is it?
[08:48.10]Oh, hold on.
[08:48.96]Wait, wait.
[08:49.40]Before we go anywhere, what the fuck is crunk?
[08:53.84]Crunk like the emperor's new groove?
[08:58.64]Hey, it's me, Patrick Warburton, Kronk.
[09:01.38]You know, I'm Joe from Family Guy 2.
[09:04.58]Peter.
[09:05.46]Hey, Peter.
[09:06.94]Let me tell you something, Peter.
[09:08.36]Is that what we're talking about?
[09:09.76]Kronk?
[09:20.96]Peter.
[09:23.61]Peter.
[09:24.47]That's what he does.
[09:27.96]I hear you.
[09:28.36]I don't think I don't hear you.
[09:36.89]Wrong lever.
[09:37.87]What are you guys talking about?
[09:40.03]What are we on right now?
[09:42.63]Speaking of, like, drugs and psychos.
[09:44.61]Hey, chat.
[09:46.10]How you doing?
[09:48.68]Grab desktop.
[09:51.32]Perfect.
[10:00.07]Holy shit, there's a huge fat guy.
[10:02.67]That's like the chef.
[10:03.81]Oh my god, my new favorite character.
[10:11.75]There's a huge lunch lady that's in this fucking room right now.
[10:18.70]Where is he?
[10:22.64]Oh my god, no, don't double do it.
[10:25.50]I'm moving around too fast.
[10:28.35]Okay, that was not that bad.
[10:31.18]I gotta watch out for the lunch lady, though.
[10:36.00]Oh, God.
[10:38.16]She looks really intimidating.
[10:39.70]I'm actually kind of scared right now.
[10:45.75]I'm over 500 pounds and I give me, give me more, more!
[10:51.39]Only 600 pounds?
[10:52.63]That's not fair!
[10:53.53]Keep feeding me, feed me more and more and more!
[10:59.09]What is that?
[10:59.71]Who knows what that is?
[11:07.90]One of you psychos and drug addicts and murderers is gonna know what that is.
[11:17.55]I caught that guy in midair.
[11:19.41]Oh, get out of here.
[11:25.87]Really?
[11:26.19]Nobody knows what that is?
[11:27.65]Wow.
[11:30.48]Unbelievable.
[11:31.18]I thought that at least a handful of you guys would know what that was.
[11:35.16]That's the Big Bertha arcade machine.
[11:37.60]With the little balls.
[11:40.04]The ball pit balls that you throw.
[11:41.92]That's like a huge fat lady that's in the back and you throw balls into her mouth and she gets fatter.
[11:47.10]Big Bertha arcade machine.
[11:48.37]Look it up right now on Google.
[11:49.31]Do it.
[11:54.33]Go look that up on YouTube.
[11:55.65]I just did a perfect exact impression of it.
[12:00.93]She yells at you because she's not fat enough.
[12:03.07]In that exact way.
[12:04.21]Go look it up!
[12:09.53]Oh.
[12:10.33]This guy used to be a teacher.
[12:13.77]Lose... Loose lips sink ships.
[12:17.27]You know, that's actually a really, really smart... That's a smart saying.
[12:23.27]This guy came up with that?
[12:27.71]I'm gonna go pick up this shotgun.
[12:29.01]Well, you didn't get it.
[12:31.36]Why wouldn't you have the shotgun here, rather than on the desk?
[12:34.34]I don't know.
[12:36.02]Let's do some invest-a-mageda.
[12:37.61]It's gonna be on the chalkboard.
[12:41.85]It's gonna be like, die, die, die!
[12:44.83]There it is.
[12:51.28]Like that.
[12:53.48]The teeth.
[12:56.52]Somebody's teeth.
[13:00.73]Human tissue.
[13:02.16]Color, adipose deposits, and adjacent facial hair stubble indicate that these are human lips and facial skin.
[13:08.90]Now, if I had this prepared, I would do something here.
[13:11.72]The gym teacher at your location during Carl Anderson's tenure was a man by the name of Samuel Tibbetts.
[13:18.99]And before you ask, yes, Tibbetts' medical records provided his blood type.
[13:23.77]It's a match of the facial tissue.
[13:24.75]I don't know what this Gronk thing is.
[13:25.89]You guys are going to have to...
[13:29.03]You guys are going to have to enlighten me on this whole thing.
[13:32.73]I've got to find Mr. Tib.
[13:38.38]Well, I can move this, actually.
[13:39.54]Can I move this?
[13:42.58]Nope.
[13:43.68]Can't move that.
[13:50.77]I mean, I kind of saw that happen.
[13:54.59]Do I still have my shotgun?
[14:02.29]He just pulled that out of the wall.
[14:03.69]A trusty hidden desktop compartment.
[14:08.09]Yeah, there's only one shot in here left.
[14:10.85]Let's just make a joke.
[14:18.58]No material in here.
[14:20.36]Sorry, guys.
[14:22.78]Sorry, guys.
[14:23.34]No material in here.
[14:27.31]Hey, thank you, squirts, for the ten dollars.
[14:30.05]Again, thanks for streams.
[14:31.07]Keep them coming.
[14:31.71]Able to catch a stream today.
[14:32.75]It's midnight.
[14:33.51]I love this game.
[14:34.29]It's good, I promise.
[14:36.33]I love this game, too.
[14:37.93]I am very much enjoying this game.
[14:40.62]It's very fun.
[14:42.94]It's got everything I want.
[14:44.62]And, interestingly enough, for those of you that have no idea, this game was actually made by, guess who?
[14:53.40]Guess who fucking made this game and the sequel?
[14:56.55]Oh, shit.
[15:03.55]She just like sends her little goonies after me.
[15:07.17]No, Gordon Ramsay did not make this game.
[15:13.12]This is made by the same guys that made Shadow of War and Shadow of Mordor.
[15:17.88]This is by Monolith.
[15:21.02]These guys made Shadow of War.
[15:26.27]Nice backwards block.
[15:33.98]Hey, easy.
[15:35.02]Good thing I turned around.
[15:35.94]Come on, dude.
[15:40.46]Really?
[15:40.82]This guy accidentally blocked all of my swings.
[15:50.17]But yeah, when I heard about that, I was like, wow.
[15:53.31]I did not know that.
[15:54.07]That's pretty cool.
[15:59.25]Climb through.
[15:59.95]There is... That looks like a normal guy.
[16:07.29]These are just like bandits.
[16:22.02]Oh, come on.
[16:26.40]Why would I be chasing you?
[16:27.36]You're the one with the gun.
[16:34.71]Alright, let's break his back.
[16:36.21]Break his back, step your mother's crack, break her back!
[16:40.21]Ooh!
[16:49.38]Huh?
[16:51.20]Why did that guy explode?
[16:53.76]What?
[16:54.10]No, I didn't fucking save it.
[16:59.01]Well, thank god there was a checkpoint right there.
[17:12.52]Yeah, get like shin kicked.
[17:19.37]You're dead.
[17:20.41]There's another one too.
[17:21.37]Oh, god damn it.
[17:22.69]I fucking knew he was here.
[17:24.23]Oh my god.
[17:25.57]Why?
[17:28.11]I knew he was here.
[17:29.00]I thought he came behind me.
[17:30.30]Oh my god.
[17:30.84]This is the hardest enemy in the game too.
[17:43.27]Asshole.
[17:44.77]Same exact thing happened.
[17:45.81]I gotta get in here before this guy with the gun comes in.
[17:57.34]God damn it.
[17:58.10]Can I block a gun?
[18:00.14]What do I... Yes!
[18:07.31]Fuck.
[18:08.79]God damn it.
[18:13.91]Okay, I gotta this time don't fuck this up this healing right there The other guy made it a glass, okay, hold on Plus press right click to deflect bullets.
[18:37.58]Hey, you know that that is probably possible.
[18:39.66]Oh
[18:40.95]This is a game from the mid-2000s.
[18:43.01]That's definitely possible.
[18:47.55]Alright, there's the easy guy.
[18:49.72]The hard guy is right here.
[18:51.28]I'm going to electrocute him.
[18:52.10]And he's still hit me.
[18:55.96]Okay, let's go heal.
[18:58.94]Save this.
[18:59.36]Is somebody behind me?
[19:04.60]Why do I hear a pitter-patter?
[19:05.52]I don't know.
[19:11.67]They flake bullets with wood?
[19:13.31]This ain't wood.
[19:16.09]Don't you guys remember the old school kids' desks?
[19:19.72]They were made out of something weird.
[19:22.14]It was weird shit.
[19:22.90]It wasn't all wood.
[19:23.44]It was the weirdest, heaviest material I've ever seen in my life.
[19:26.60]It was made out of graphene.
[19:27.84]Where's your gun?
[19:37.39]Where's the guy's gun?
[19:38.11]He just dropped it.
[19:43.64]Where's the gun?
[19:44.26]You just dropped it on the ground!
[19:48.62]There it is.
[19:50.50]How many bullets?
[19:51.48]Nine.
[20:00.04]There's a shotgun.
[20:02.22]Where's the shotgun?
[20:08.04]I don't even see a shotgun.
[20:09.78]Is it like on the table?
[20:11.86]I got a gun, I'm good.
[20:25.00]Oh, there it is.
[20:26.52]Um, I'm gonna use this for now.
[20:32.38]Oh, god damn it, really?
[20:36.83]Where's the... Where did you even come from?
[20:40.23]Where did this guy come from?
[20:47.22]That guy was a... God.
[20:53.63]What is he holding?
[20:54.61]What kind of weapon is that?
[21:00.08]Sub machine gun?
[21:02.94]Why was he shooting it like that?
[21:04.74]He was shooting it with one hand like a pistol.
[21:10.39]Oh, I'm gonna go heal.
[21:13.13]I can't.
[21:13.47]It's closed.
[21:21.54]What about this thing?
[21:22.74]No.
[21:30.19]What is this, Halo 2?
[21:38.73]Watch out, there's a Kronk on the table.
[21:41.53]What happened today?
[21:46.30]Did some meme originate today?
[21:49.90]Did somebody do something on Twitch?
[21:56.91]Well, I need the sledgehammer, so we're going to waste this.
[21:58.51]I just want to see if that guy was an idiot.
[22:02.21]That guy was an idiot.
[22:05.89]I'm obviously going to need this to break open some door somewhere.
[22:15.93]Oh, the new COD?
[22:16.75]How is the new COD?
[22:19.69]You know, actually, I saw a review on the new COD that gave it, like, a very high score, and all they pretty much said in the review was, it's just like all the other ones.
[22:30.19]Hey, if you like Call of Duty, you'll like Call of Duty.
[22:33.46]It just gets a good score, because it's the same game you played last year.
[22:39.30]Is that, like, is that a reason to rate a game high?
[22:41.24]Because it's, like, I remember when, like, I played the one two years ago, and it's like this one.
[22:46.24]I don't understand.
[22:47.92]You know, this game gets an 89, because I remember playing this same game four years ago, and it's the same game that I played four years ago, so I'm giving it a 90.
[22:57.79]What?
[23:01.15]What are you on about?
[23:15.37]Got him.
[23:19.86]The same thing would apply with Mario Odyssey.
[23:21.58]Would it, though?
[23:22.06]I feel like, okay, to make, like, a Super Mario level, yeah, Mario is essentially the same game over and over again, right?
[23:31.74]But is it more difficult to make a, like, Call of Duty map than it is to make, like, a platformer, like a 3D platformer level?
[23:39.95]I don't know.
[23:40.71]That's a tough question.
[23:41.99]I don't think so.
[23:42.47]I don't want to jump down.
[23:53.82]Did I miss anything up here while I was just shit-talking?
[24:01.12]No, I guess I have to go down there.
[24:06.78]Yeah, that's a good point.
[24:07.96]GamerOnTouch has a really good point.
[24:09.86]They don't make a Mario game every year.
[24:13.18]There's no, like, 3D jumping platform Mario game.
[24:16.44]Usually there's one, like, per generation.
[24:19.15]of, like, these types of Mario Odyssey Marios.
[24:21.67]If Call of Duty came out... That guy was angry at me.
[24:27.38]Are you talking shit about Call of Duty?
[24:31.60]I'll kill him!
[24:33.84]I'm gonna crawl up to his ankles and smash him!
[24:35.90]What the hell is that?
[24:37.90]Is that me?
[24:51.48]Um, well, okay.
[24:55.40]They don't make a drum or rumble every year.
[24:57.62]I don't know.
[25:00.52]I think I'm just like a jaded old fuck.
[25:03.00]I really think so.
[25:04.52]I'm not even kidding.
[25:08.10]It's like video games are turning into like sports simulators.
[25:12.12]That's a sick run, by the way.
[25:13.40]They were doing the I'm a cat and I'm scared and angry at you jump.
[25:18.90]You know what I mean?
[25:19.36]Like, I feel like every single game is just the same game again.
[25:25.44]Like, Call of Duty, World War II, like, it's just, it's like they've made, like, they've made, like, 17 of these games.
[25:31.55]Every, for, like, 17 years.
[25:33.29]Alright, well, I think there's something bad gonna happen in here.
[25:51.82]Am I getting hurt?
[25:52.42]Am I coming in like the paint factory?
[26:02.60]I will give you points for creativity.
[26:06.08]You know?
[26:06.84]You had points for creativity.
[26:08.90]Other than that, execution was really, really lacking here.
[26:19.56]Anything else?
[26:26.02]Got her!
[26:27.14]I got her!
[26:27.82]I claimed the fat Pokémon!
[26:31.80]Oh wow, that was disgusting.
[26:32.88]She's trying to run still.
[26:35.30]Oh, I backed her into a wall.
[26:42.13]Oh shit, I'm in trouble.
[26:43.47]Oh my god, she actually does a lot of damage.
[26:46.21]Alright, we're gonna ring around the fire axe.
[26:49.43]Meat cleaver required?
[26:50.69]What?
[26:50.91]Alright, let's see if I can just reach over there.
[26:56.55]Come on.
[26:57.83]Come on.
[26:58.31]We both had the same exact idea.
[27:00.40]Don't die here.
[27:01.16]Save it.
[27:01.48]Quick.
[27:09.90]Got it.
[27:15.39]Okay.
[27:18.01]So now I have to use the cleaver and cut this off.
[27:23.39]God, the cleaver.
[27:24.91]That cleaver is such a cool weapon.
[27:26.03]I don't want to, like, get rid of that.
[27:28.64]What the fuck?
[27:32.68]We're okay.
[27:36.36]I hear another guy, too.
[27:39.93]R.I.P.
[27:40.57]Hamburger Lady.
[27:44.19]R.I.P.
[27:45.11]Rest in pieces.
[27:52.93]Rip hamburger lady.
[27:56.62]There it is.
[27:57.26]There's the goodness.
[28:03.14]Quick save.
[28:03.82]And then it's out here.
[28:04.52]And we gotta break down the wall.
[28:09.49]There is a wall.
[28:10.73]Right in the balls.
[28:13.37]Over and over again.
[28:13.87]Achilles dead.
[28:14.29]Calm down, dude.
[28:15.71]What?
[28:27.03]Into the gymnasium.
[28:29.91]There's a good checkpoint.
[28:31.63]Which brings us to a rolling ball.
[28:34.65]You know what that means.
[28:36.09]Pennywise is somewhere around here.
[28:37.79]Hey, somebody call Tom Brady.
[28:48.42]I can't use that.
[28:49.14]I used that last... We said that exact same thing.
[28:51.76]Like, oh, okay, Mac, if you're watching, like, just...
[28:55.54]Pretend I didn't make the deflate gate joke.
[28:58.20]I don't even fucking watch football.
[29:00.18]I don't even care.
[29:01.92]Why am I doing that?
[29:03.05]I don't know why I'm doing that.
[29:12.15]Guys got a nice watch.
[29:20.58]It seems the perpetrator ate plenty of Flamin' Hot Cheetos before they were killed.
[29:28.53]The green kind.
[29:30.17]Flamin' Hot Jalapeno Cheetos.
[29:33.21]It's Tibbetts.
[29:34.21]Fingerprints from his personnel file match the hand.
[29:36.98]It looks like the torturer got to him before we did.
[29:41.42]It's a new brand.
[29:42.58]Continue searching for Mr. Tibbetts.
[29:44.90]That is such a school teacher name, isn't it?
[29:54.86]What if there was a kid there?
[29:57.79]Absolutely disgraceful construction.
[29:59.47]What if there was a kid there playing basketball?
[30:01.49]Disgraceful.
[30:10.73]Where'd he go?
[30:12.08]But anyways, my point was...
[30:17.12]Uh, I don't think I've ever, like, every, if you're a teacher and you're teaching, like, school children, your name has to be something like that.
[30:25.36]It has to be, like, Mr. Tibbets.
[30:31.01]And you have to wear, like, a bow tie.
[30:33.21]You have to be, like, a real Bill Nye-looking asshole, you know what I mean?
[30:36.35]Like, well, hey, everybody, welcome to school!
[30:38.91]It's me, Mr. Tibbets!
[30:40.95]And, like, he pulls a string, and, like, the bow tie, like, spins around.
[30:51.12]But Bill Nye is a nice guy.
[30:52.40]I don't think I can do that.
[30:57.84]Here we go.
[31:00.74]Don't talk shit about Bill Nye.
[31:02.04]I didn't talk shit about Bill Nye.
[31:03.48]What did I say about Bill Nye?
[31:08.67]I said a Bill Nye looking asshole.
[31:13.05]Not the fact that Bill Nye's an asshole.
[31:14.67]The guy that's dressing up as Bill Nye is the asshole.
[31:19.77]I grew up on Bill Nye.
[31:22.38]He used to, like, drop bowling balls and marbles at the same time and drop them and... He had, like, a funny nose.
[31:30.53]He wore, like, a mouse nose and shit.
[31:32.47]And he had, like, a big green jacket on.
[31:34.78]Yeah, there was, like, the big mouse that was with him.
[31:39.76]I grew up on that show.
[31:41.12]Bill Nye... No, that's Beakman's World.
[31:43.79]Uh...
[31:47.78]Beakman's World is a... Alright, but let's talk about Beakman's World because apparently I don't like Bill Nye.
[31:51.96]I like Beakman's World.
[31:55.46]There was a fucking giant rat in Beakman's World.
[32:01.77]Bring back Beakman's World.
[32:17.79]Uh-oh.
[32:18.89]The mayor!
[32:20.65]He was crushed in the head by... Oh, is that me?
[32:22.47]Who is that?
[32:22.91]Is that me?
[32:23.89]That's me lying on the ground.
[32:47.63]So I've just been this guy.
[32:50.13]The whole time.
[32:53.83]I love how this guy has like two kendo sticks, by the way.
[32:56.12]Oh, don't worry!
[33:09.80]I'll get him!
[33:15.08]What?
[33:15.30]Are these guys wearing like spray paint?
[33:18.94]I don't think he's dead.
[33:19.60]Oh, now he is.
[33:24.96]Alright, well, sorry guys.
[33:27.96]You didn't do a good job.
[33:34.64]Good thing I did that, otherwise I never would have seen you.
[33:38.72]Now we have to go down the slide.
[33:41.52]Can I?
[33:43.89]Oh, finally!
[33:45.07]Guy comes in with a machine gun.
[33:47.71]Oh my god, am I actually going to die here because I was going to go up the fucking slide?
[33:52.91]Everybody has a gun now and there's like 30 people here.
[33:56.21]I'm going to die.
[33:57.87]I'm dead.
[34:00.15]We made all those, we talked all that shit about the guy.
[34:04.84]Oh my god, why?
[34:06.20]What the fuck?
[34:07.14]If I was only paying attention.
[34:08.52]Oh well, we can do this again.
[34:10.48]Let's really make this guy's life a living hell.
[34:17.42]Okay, he just had second thoughts.
[34:21.14]Should I do this?
[34:24.61]I shouldn't have done that!
[34:25.71]I had one opportunity to look and see if I could do it!
[34:54.32]He wasn't dead.
[34:55.12]He was still unconscious until then.
[34:57.26]Oh, shit.
[35:00.79]Okay, well now I have a fucking rifle now.
[35:15.38]Why is it... Oh, shit, there's three Pennywises.
[35:18.98]Why is it always the guy with the gun that gets killed by the shittiest enemy?
[35:22.58]I don't understand.
[35:23.36]Do I have four bullets?
[35:29.99]This is a one-hit-one-kill, for sure.
[35:31.71]Alright, by the way, guys, watch what happens when... And by the way, watch what happens when I press this game.
[35:46.20]Oh, fuck you, Luigi!
[35:50.12]Fixed it.
[35:56.38]Just get down there.
[36:02.80]Sick entrance.
[36:08.79]Oh, sorry guys, no more pictures for you.
[36:15.14]R.I.P.
[36:15.94]Screenshot, and by the way, you'll get a little bit of spaghetti on your escape key.
[36:21.57]You know, I've watched that video.
[36:27.27]That video has like 17 million views.
[36:29.95]I think I've watched that video 1,600 times.
[36:33.26]I must be like a small percentage of every view on that video.
[36:44.99]Just to let you know, Jerma985 is like 0.5% of every view on that video.
[36:52.54]Oh, I can see the moon.
[37:01.08]Oh, let's see.
[37:01.62]What are we looking at here?
[37:02.32]What are we looking at?
[37:02.82]What are we looking for?
[37:03.59]Aha!
[37:07.13]There it is.
[37:08.47]There's the blood.
[37:09.91]Hey, come on.
[37:15.17]Isn't that it?
[37:15.77]Right there.
[37:17.84]It's glowing.
[37:19.36]A big, bright purple.
[37:21.76]It sure is.
[37:27.38]Why does it keep switching, like, uh... Okay.
[37:37.20]Got it.
[37:40.47]So, wait.
[37:40.75]Somebody put Mr. Tibbetts in a straitjacket?
[37:44.79]Like, murdered him?
[37:45.51]That's, like, not cool.
[37:50.73]The door... Alright, I thought the door was alive.
[37:52.35]I was supposed to say, this is some brave little toaster shit, though.
[37:58.43]Looked like the door was walking away.
[38:02.35]I found somebody's prop hunt.
[38:04.42]Hiding spot.
[38:08.02]Mr. Tibbetts?
[38:10.36]Mr. Tibbetts, I just want to help you.
[38:12.94]I just want to help you, Mr. Tibbetts.
[38:21.61]Weapon of choice.
[38:23.19]I have to use the rifle.
[38:24.11]I have to shoot one guy with the rifle.
[38:25.77]We have to shoot one guy five times.
[38:31.71]That's a bird.
[38:43.28]I had an opportunity right there.
[38:50.64]I have to go back and get my locker.
[38:53.70]Oh, there's another opportunity for a locker here.
[38:58.69]Right?
[39:02.08]Come on, give me a new locker.
[39:19.23]What a waste of bullets.
[39:21.09]Move object.
[39:23.79]Alright, come on.
[39:25.57]There you are.
[39:26.39]Alright, now I can get my locker.
[39:35.10]Oh, actually, I have to climb through there.
[39:39.54]That was just a means to an end.
[39:44.52]Hey, Mr. Tibbets.
[39:52.25]Alright, get calmed down, Salad Fingers.
[39:56.61]Go eat somebody.
[40:05.32]Yes, it's Salad Fingers.
[40:08.94]Tasty.
[40:09.72]Ooh, Mr. Cumberbatch.
[40:14.92]When are we gonna get the movie?
[40:16.68]When are we gonna get the Salad Fingers movie, huh?
[40:23.27]I've been waiting for that for 10 years!
[40:32.44]Ow, rusty spoons.
[40:38.22]Ow.
[40:43.34]Ow.
[40:48.21]Ow.
[40:48.43]Ow.
[40:49.69]Sorry.
[40:55.05]Ah, I see.
[40:55.91]Bugs Bunny was here earlier.
[41:04.13]God's name is wrong with this guy.
[41:08.31]That's when chat goes, yeah, you must be new here.
[41:10.07]The trail just ends at a bank of lockers.
[41:12.78]Thomas, have you looked inside?
[41:17.16]Have I looked inside the lockers?
[41:18.56]Okay, here comes a... I'm going to get jump scared here.
[41:20.88]Prepare your jump scares.
[41:22.10]Let's see if we can glitch through and see him in there.
[41:32.95]Oh no, Mr. Tibbetts!
[41:37.05]Oh boy, somebody stuffed Mr. Tibbetts in a locker like eight years ago, and he never got out.
[42:08.50]I know eventually this is gonna happen eventually like one of these guys I'm taking a picture of close-up is gonna just be like Screaming the camera I told you Help is on the way who did this to you?
[42:28.90]I told you.
[42:30.06]Let's get you to a doctor.
[42:32.66]I told you.
[42:32.98]I told you.
[43:03.17]Who the hell is that guy?
[43:10.87]The shovel killed him.
[43:14.22]The shovel, the shovel ended up killing him.
[43:18.20]That's all he had, that's all the strength he had left.
[43:20.96]He kind of stubbed toe and he died.
[43:22.52]Cancel that.
[43:31.05]similar to the pesticide we found on the matchmaker's neck?
[43:34.47]An exact match.
[43:36.13]I've been running an analysis on those samples.
[43:38.65]It's azanthosmethyl and is class one, highly toxic.
[43:41.94]Death by shovel.
[43:42.30]Too bad.
[43:43.08]Was previously used as an insecticide for all sorts of agricultural crops.
[43:47.44]Now banned for domestic use and can only be used commercially by permission.
[43:52.64]This particular formulation includes some other trace chemicals and can be matched to a brand new... I feel like I could have saved that guy.
[44:01.12]to see if we can get a purchaser's list.
[44:03.90]Apple well.
[44:05.58]Apples.
[44:06.60]Yes, as I said, it was used on all sorts of agricultural crops.
[44:10.35]Apples would be one of those.
[44:12.13]Yeah, the town of Briar is pretty rural.
[44:14.47]Any chances there's an apple orchard up there?
[44:16.55]No chance.
[44:19.49]I really feel like I could have saved this guy, though.
[44:21.71]You know?
[44:23.45]What you would have done... Here's a medical term that I want you guys to make sure you're aware of.
[44:30.21]So...
[44:32.79]What I would do is make sure you, well, first of all, always carry a tube of bacitracin.
[44:36.69]You know, always have a tube of bacitracin on you, no matter what.
[44:40.80]I would leap into action, open the door, see him there, help, grab, tourniquet, rip my shirt, just rip it off, fucking wrap around his arm, take bacitracin, smear it all over his body, just a full tube of bacitracin, just all over him.
[44:54.75]Take out some Bactain spray, spray it in his eyes.
[44:58.27]Make sure that the infection can't spread anymore.
[45:01.43]Tourniquet on his arm.
[45:02.69]And I would grab his... At that point, they have so much blood loss.
[45:07.17]You've got to wrap your hands around their head and just gyrate their face and be like, stay with me, stay with me, stay with me, stay with me, stay with me, stay with me, stay with me, and they're going to have to focus on you.
[45:15.86]Vastatracian will get all in their bloodstream, fix them, get them some water, force it down his mouth, and then EMT gets their local hero.
[45:31.03]Don't do that, though.
[45:40.96]He's saving him?
[45:42.02]We're assaulting him.
[45:42.98]You know, that's a good question.
[45:51.03]So what am I supposed to do now?
[45:54.55]Meet Van Horn in front of school.
[45:58.18]There even is a school in this game.
[45:59.58]I don't want to make, you know, three strikes and you're out.
[46:03.18]You know exactly what I'm going to say.
[46:05.87]And I can't run anymore, so that means that there's a bad guy right here.
[46:08.55]No?
[46:09.37]Yep.
[46:09.85]Well, the door actually is alive.
[46:16.09]We thought that was such a stupid joke.
[46:18.41]The door is an organic person.
[46:21.33]It's alive.
[46:28.72]Okay.
[46:29.68]Well... That was not even that funny of a joke before, but it's real now, so... I can't even go this way.
[46:41.36]It's just creeped up there.
[46:48.07]That's so perfect.
[46:49.97]Oh, I'm so happy that happened.
[46:52.29]Talk to the door.
[46:53.99]Hey, bub.
[46:56.59]You're looking to get out of here, aren't you?
[47:03.50]So what, um, how am I supposed to get out of here if I can't go through the door?
[47:17.23]Hey, bub.
[47:19.83]It's me, Dorverine.
[47:22.72]The Wolverine door.
[47:23.66]Oh, that one hurt.
[47:27.94]That one hurt me.
[47:28.80]I'm sorry.
[47:29.34]That one actually hurt my body as I was saying it.
[47:34.65]Oh, that fucking hurt.
[47:36.21]I'm so sorry.
[47:37.09]My whole body hurts after saying that.
[47:41.83]That was like a terrible shit robot chicken joke.
[47:47.15]Just, like, make the... Go to something else.
[47:53.04]Alright, but honestly, how the hell do I get out of here?
[48:00.65]Shouldn't I be able to get up this?
[48:02.69]Wouldn't that make sense if I could climb here?
[48:09.35]It's a Wolverine.
[48:10.99]Oh, boy.
[48:18.48]What do I... No, get this.
[48:23.84]Um, well, it looks like I can't go that way.
[48:27.46]Because Dorverine is currently blocking the door.
[48:31.97]So, what's the exit then?
[48:35.49]How do I leave?
[48:45.21]You keep clicking on robot chicken videos expecting them to be funny?
[48:50.85]Well, that's the thing.
[48:54.45]Robot chicken?
[48:56.47]Got ya.
[49:01.02]You thought you were going to be able to go somewhere and grab a stick.
[49:04.74]Nope.
[49:08.32]Robot chicken is, I don't know.
[49:12.62]Need a shovel.
[49:13.97]What is that?
[49:16.75]What is going on in that room?
[49:20.31]Is that a person in there?
[49:21.37]Or is that like a piece of furniture?
[49:27.44]Okay.
[49:30.54]Uh, well, it's time to investigate.
[49:32.66]Whatever the hell that is.
[49:33.51]I'm gonna take this real slow.
[49:40.95]I need a shovel.
[49:49.99]Wait, there was a shovel next to the gym teacher.
[49:53.41]Why am I calling him a gym teacher?
[49:54.69]I don't know what he is.
[50:02.90]Okay, so... Let's go find out what's going on in that room.
[50:11.12]No, the game just froze on me.
[50:12.38]Come on.
[50:19.64]Mm-hmm.
[50:24.02]Alright, so is that still going on?
[50:26.61]It is.
[50:28.79]I want to save this because I really don't want to ruin anything that's going on in there.
[50:32.05]I'm gonna try not to.
[50:39.20]Oh, shit.
[50:39.94]Okay, so this is gonna turn off the steam.
[50:43.35]It's still happening.
[50:52.69]I think someone was just spinning around in a circle.
[50:56.07]Some psycho torturer was just making a guy spin around in a circle.
[50:59.73]A thousand miles per hour, and then he, like, slit his throat.
[51:06.56]Checkpoint!
[51:07.28]Is that a guy?
[51:09.16]Alright, tell me that that does not look like one of the enemies from Half-Life 2.
[51:16.16]Right across the way.
[51:17.50]That's one of those, like, walker combine things.
[51:22.33]Right?
[51:27.25]You see it, don't you?
[51:29.85]Right there.
[51:41.80]Here it comes.
[51:42.98]I mean, it might look...
[51:51.64]Again, I'm gonna give you an A-plus for creativity, but if you didn't land on me, you were going to die.
[52:05.49]Double.
[52:10.97]Uh, double kill.
[52:12.65]End sequence.
[52:18.92]I don't think I'm supposed to win this.
[52:25.08]I guess I am supposed to win this.
[52:28.14]Alright.
[52:29.91]Well, we can watch that again.
[52:32.01]Let's try to catch him.
[52:33.41]I'm going to do everything in my power to catch this guy.
[52:42.31]Wait a minute.
[52:46.91]I want to try to hit him in the ear and see what happens.
[52:50.90]I'm going to try to just full-on swing and hit him in the ear.
[52:55.94]Just kill me.
[52:59.38]What happens if they grab you and they don't let go?
[53:05.68]I'm not going to be able to find out.
[53:09.66]We're going to save this right when he's about to fall.
[53:12.43]And we're going to try to get a home run.
[53:17.46]I think it would be better if... No, the shovel will be okay.
[53:20.32]So remember, quick save right when we land here.
[53:23.18]Like, right... No.
[53:26.56]Like, no.
[53:42.09]No!
[53:42.23]What?! !
[53:50.33]Oh, it just saves after... Fuck it, whatever.
[53:52.59]Alright, let's just clean this up.
[54:08.05]Let's clean it up.
[54:21.62]Damn, I didn't want to get hit once.
[54:22.62]Can't walk that shit.
[54:31.57]I can't even see when they come at me.
[54:32.93]I think that was three in a row.
[54:35.93]Where are they?
[54:38.79]What the fuck?
[54:40.77]Jesus.
[54:45.15]Well, that would have been nice to know existed.
[55:00.79]I come out of here with a gun.
[55:02.13]And no health.
[55:02.79]That was like a dream sequence.
[55:03.97]Bullshit.
[55:06.33]What do you mean, NA textbook?
[55:16.32]Because I held the button down?
[55:18.94]I need my fire axe.
[55:24.46]Didn't I just have one down here?
[55:31.19]And a textbook.
[55:36.65]I told you guys I went to, like, a gun range.
[55:39.83]I've only ever been once in my life.
[55:41.19]But one of my friends... Like, it's a lot of money.
[55:44.26]If you ever go to, like, a gun range... It's a lot of money to do it.
[55:50.26]And you don't get very many rounds.
[55:54.44]So, you get, like...
[55:58.80]Oh, NA!
[55:59.50]Look at this NA aimer!
[56:01.02]NA!
[56:04.96]North Atlantic!
[56:09.18]I'm gonna die if I'm not careful here, seriously.
[56:12.46]So anyways, a friend of mine, we went there and you get like three, you get to choose like a couple different guns to fire, right?
[56:20.47]and a friend of mine is just like, yeah, let's do this, let's do that, that sounds like interesting, okay, like, yeah, it's a very, like, safe environment, uh, we don't want to shoot anything crazy, nothing like gigantic, like, 500 caliber sniper, no, I don't want to do that.
[56:33.63]So we picked, like, a submachine gun, and it, you only get, like, like, a one magazine, right?
[56:41.96]So we get up there, and I go, and I'm just like, okay, I'm gonna, like, okay, cool, let me try to aim a little more, and
[56:51.13]Burst fire a little bit of single shot.
[56:52.61]Okay, cool.
[56:53.41]That was fun I took about that took like about a full like two or three minutes for me to do that My friend gets on it.
[56:59.99]It's his turn.
[57:00.99]He gets up there.
[57:02.13]Okay, you ready?
[57:02.80]Yeah, I'm ready Done he's like, oh, that's cool.
[57:09.20]It's like do what no you what are you doing?
[57:13.52]He held the fucking button down And he just missed like everything I
[57:19.69]It was like fucking $89 to do that.
[57:28.22]Oh, another organic door.
[57:36.14]The button, what do you mean?
[57:37.66]He held the button down.
[57:42.48]He held down the button.
[57:46.60]Oh, no.
[57:47.88]Hey, Bob, listen.
[57:49.28]Hey, I don't take shit from anybody.
[57:52.82]It's me, Bob.
[57:53.90]Dwarf Marine.
[57:56.76]Going in the fucking video.
[57:57.68]Oh, look, this one didn't want to do it.
[58:02.46]That's not canon.
[58:03.46]That's not canon, Dwarf Marine.
[58:05.32]It's not.
[58:06.26]Not canon.
[58:07.04]Oh, yes it is, Bob.
[58:17.93]Nice jokes.
[58:19.46]N.A.
[58:19.80]jokes.
[58:20.26]Ah, well, guess what, man?
[58:21.62]I don't know if you know this or not, but I do live in North America, so that would be a North America joke.
[58:31.83]You would be correct.
[58:33.85]Uh-oh.
[58:38.39]Terrible, terrible security cameras you got here.
[58:43.04]How am I supposed to tell what's what?
[58:46.58]That's a door.
[58:48.48]This is like a hallway.
[58:49.90]Somebody needs to really fix these cameras.
[58:51.86]They're all fogged up.
[58:59.98]Oh, secret!
[59:10.23]I need to just get out of here.
[59:11.13]What was the point of this?
[59:16.76]So there was no point of this... Okay, well, I'm locked in here.
[59:19.37]So I gotta go this way.
[59:20.95]By the way, uh... Not even checking my health.
[59:37.03]We got a quick save here.
[59:39.13]You have to say... Is there any bosses in this game?
[59:41.11]Is there any bosses in this game?
[59:42.70]Speak proper... Oh, N.A.
[59:44.10]N.A.
[59:45.02]N.A.
[59:45.30]English.
[59:49.31]Is there any bosses in this here game?
[59:52.88]I don't really have to use the bow.
[59:58.32]And last week on Bathroom Battles.
[60:01.58]Remember this joke?
[60:02.40]Remember we did this one?
[60:03.50]And this is a better bathroom to do it in too.
[60:12.87]Lunch lady?
[60:13.61]I killed the lunch lady already.
[60:17.26]There's only one lunch lady.
[60:19.25]And she's gone.
[60:19.75]Okay.
[60:24.55]Time for stall roulette.
[60:29.07]There's a guy in one of these.
[60:30.87]We're gonna do this very slowly and very methodically.
[60:45.53]What happened?
[60:47.59]Oh.
[60:48.91]I'm just, I'm going to sleep and waking up.
[60:51.87]Dah, another zit.
[60:54.85]That was a big one.
[61:07.51]That was like, that was a, that zit was bigger than the last one.
[61:14.14]going on?
[61:14.66]Why am I like a bug now?
[61:17.52]I'm actually a fly.
[61:18.83]That's what a fly does.
[61:21.57]I was a bug.
[61:22.21]I told you.
[61:22.61]Oh.
[61:27.03]Nope.
[61:32.36]Hello?
[61:39.03]It's in Bugs Life 2.
[61:41.79]Apple Seed Orchard, just outside of Breyer on Route 4.
[61:45.64]In business for 40 years, but closed its doors just 10 years ago after a tremendous outbreak of apple maggots.
[61:52.48]The orchard never recovered.
[61:54.54]Curious, though.
[61:56.00]County deeds show it's owned by an out-of-state real estate firm.
[62:01.58]Out-of-state, not N.A.?
[62:02.64]I don't even know if I want to see it.
[62:06.43]So much to say, it was an EU Overwatch team.
[62:11.61]Whatever.
[62:12.03]The only reason why, that's my favorite weapon.
[62:29.35]It's because I held the button down.
[62:30.95]I know I'm saying button.
[62:32.03]It's just easier.
[62:32.77]It's like trigger.
[62:34.87]Trigger.
[62:35.41]It's the same thing when you say magazine versus clip.
[62:39.17]Like, oh, I gotta put another clip in.
[62:40.59]It's just, it's, it's like, you know what I'm saying.
[62:43.31]You know what I mean.
[62:44.75]The thing that goes into the gun that makes you shoot more gun.
[62:48.60]That thing that lets you hold button down to shoot more of gun.
[62:55.70]I'm actually driven.
[62:57.36]It's a magazine.
[62:58.38]A clip is a clip is when you load a of a Ford of auto before the automatic.
[63:06.66]It's not an automatic it's it loads into the chamber.
[63:13.62]It's a clip.
[63:14.24]It's a magazine either or neither nor you tomato, tomato, potato, potato.
[63:19.08]I have a sense of responsibility.
[63:22.16]I needed to help.
[63:25.14]Help.
[63:26.17]You mean with my investigation?
[63:28.27]Yes, among other things.
[63:31.46]There was a time I thought I was the best investigator the Bureau ever had.
[63:35.32]Gideon who makes fun of guns knows nothing about guns.
[63:36.86]Now it seems they're interested in me for other reasons.
[63:39.40]What?
[63:40.04]What do you mean?
[63:41.46]I saw my file.
[63:42.41]I'm not making fun of guns.
[63:43.63]What?
[63:43.73]Apparently I'm some sort of circus freak to them.
[63:45.43]Hmm.
[63:47.37]That may not be helpful.
[63:50.07]I wonder how much they know of what is happening.
[63:53.45]I would stay away from the Bureau as long as I could.
[63:56.78]It's not like I have much choice, since they still think I killed those two officers.
[64:01.36]No, you did.
[64:01.92]The deaths were unfortunate, but maybe it's best this way.
[64:07.26]Best?
[64:08.62]You seem to know a lot more about what's happening than you're letting on.
[64:13.35]Uh-oh, he did the eye thing.
[64:15.61]This is Sample Seed Orchard Estate.
[64:17.55]Stay on your toes.
[64:19.41]I'll drop you off at the house and head over to the barn.
[64:22.39]I'll meet up with you later.
[64:23.80]Jeremy, did you tune into any of the Blizzcon streams?
[64:25.94]I tuned into some Blizzcon.
[64:29.47]Unimpressed.
[64:30.65]Wholeheartedly unimpressed.
[64:33.33]New Overwatch hero.
[64:34.83]Which is just hell from Smite.
[64:36.45]I mean, that's kind of cool.
[64:37.85]They put hell from Smite into Overwatch.
[64:42.31]But I'm not going to talk shit about that because Paladins is just Overwatch or whatever.
[64:49.09]Well, that's interesting.
[64:50.15]That's cool that they're still putting heroes into the game.
[64:53.27]And World of Warcraft Classic.
[64:55.55]A.K.A.
[64:57.01]We're just going to go back to Patch 1.0.
[64:58.35]We don't have to do anything.
[64:59.88]We just have to activate Patch 1.0 servers.
[65:04.74]That's it.
[65:06.14]You're going to be able to play as a disciplined priest and have everybody remove you from their parties.
[65:10.06]I can't wait.
[65:14.37]Can't wait to go do Molten Core and only have Paladins and Shamans as the whole group.
[65:22.85]Where am I?
[65:33.60]You know, I'm extra salty about BlizzCon because... Let me pause for a second.
[65:38.72]I'm going to wait for a minute.
[65:41.58]Because... Like, what happened to Diablo?
[65:47.75]Diablo.
[65:49.71]We have no plans to announce anything Diablo related.
[65:52.55]There's no Diablo.
[65:53.49]Don't even mention it.
[65:54.87]Don't even talk about it.
[65:58.44]Like, the only Diablo stuff we've gotten is just, like, we got a $15 Necromancer that nobody wanted.
[66:05.44]Hey, everybody.
[66:07.20]Here's... Remember Reaper of Souls?
[66:10.17]It was a $30 expansion with, like, tons and tons of content.
[66:14.13]Please pay us half of that expansion for the Necromancer.
[66:18.43]I don't know.
[66:24.57]I'm salty about this year's BlizzCon because I really thought they were going to announce at least a potential... You know how they're talking about Warcraft 3 Remaster?
[66:32.95]Even if they gave a D2 that can run at normal resolutions in 2017.
[66:38.47]Don't even update the graphics.
[66:41.35]Just make it so.
[66:42.27]Put it on the Blizzard launcher.
[66:44.69]Give us even 720p or whatever.
[66:49.65]Do something with it.
[66:55.41]Diablo has just been such a dead franchise for Blizzard for at least two or three years now.
[67:02.78]But please put Hanzo in Heroes of the Storm.
[67:06.94]Like, okay.
[67:18.51]And look, I love Blizzard.
[67:22.98]Blizzard is like... I've not enjoyed myself in any other games.
[67:29.08]Come on, this is a crowbar.
[67:31.44]You're telling me that the eagle from the Muppets can't open this?
[67:34.14]That's bullshit.
[67:38.64]I love Blizzard.
[67:39.80]With a passion.
[67:42.58]My favorite games ever made are Blizzard games.
[67:45.09]Diablo II.
[67:46.43]I put years of my life into World of Warcraft.
[67:50.43]I love that company.
[67:52.80]But man, they're just kind of sweeping Diablo under the rug these last few years.
[67:56.48]What does this say?
[68:00.84]Through the valley and through the woods to Grandmother's house we go?
[68:03.02]Holy shit!
[68:05.79]Alright, now let's take a look around.
[68:08.93]Why am I taking a picture of the door?
[68:14.83]What does this want me to do?
[68:21.26]Oh, okay.
[68:30.13]Please take a picture of that door.
[68:31.45]I don't know.
[68:33.37]It looks like it could have been a door for rings.
[68:40.26]Okay.
[68:40.58]Well, there's more.
[68:42.96]The dark path to righteousness.
[68:48.12]I think we're going to follow this.
[68:54.49]I'm going to get ambushed.
[69:02.80]And... Can I smash this?
[69:11.60]I'm sure I need this.
[69:12.52]Maybe not.
[69:20.87]You know what this is?
[69:22.67]Did your guys' parents ever hide Easter baskets in the house with a string that was connected?
[69:28.66]Like everybody got a string.
[69:30.70]So if you had like two or three kids in your family, everybody got a string and you had to follow the string around the whole house to find the Easter egg basket.
[69:51.78]It was pretty cool.
[69:57.56]What the fuck?
[70:01.16]Where's my Easter egg basket?
[70:03.22]I just want some chocolate.
[70:04.28]I want my candy.
[70:10.22]I hear somebody.
[70:16.66]No, it was really cool.
[70:17.44]It was a streamer.
[70:20.70]They had a streamer.
[70:21.54]It was a streamer.
[70:23.22]And in the streamer, you kind of follow it.
[70:26.68]Everyone had a different color.
[70:27.56]It was really cool.
[70:38.93]Oh, no.
[70:39.31]We have to, like, go find the riddle.
[70:43.39]So, this really is the Easter egg baskets.
[70:45.41]I just found my Easter egg baskets.
[70:48.07]So, I gotta go find my sister's Easter egg basket.
[70:54.95]Hers is down in the basement.
[71:05.72]I'm gonna get collapsed on here.
[71:25.66]God, what the fuck?
[71:31.89]He tripped over the box and it gave me an opportunity.
[71:33.91]Thank God.
[71:40.87]Puzzle.
[71:41.53]Ooh, I hope I got some candy corn in mine.
[71:47.09]I hope so.
[71:52.13]You know, it's just gonna be down here, so why do I even need to follow the trail?
[71:56.25]It's just gonna be in the sink or something, right?
[72:01.18]See?
[72:02.58]It's just in the sink.
[72:13.37]Wrong holiday.
[72:16.81]Is it the wrong holiday?
[72:32.75]Get out of here come on you stupid Get out of my life get out of my get out of my town Can I open that no Get the lights off let's make this a real horror game experience No lights No bullshit
[72:59.21]No escape.
[73:01.09]So this is the... Let's make sure I didn't miss something down here.
[73:09.14]There might be two in the basement.
[73:16.68]There could be two in the basement.
[73:19.24]No, there's not.
[73:24.04]Upstairs.
[73:26.99]And let's continue our investigation.
[73:33.75]Uh-huh.
[73:34.64]We gotta... Is there a person here?
[73:39.20]Nothing there.
[73:39.94]What about over here?
[73:40.84]No, that leads into the basement.
[73:45.42]This leads over here.
[73:49.25]That door opens both directions.
[73:51.49]God damn it.
[73:52.11]I don't want to find another person's picnic basket.
[73:56.53]I have enough trouble finding my own.
[73:58.23]I don't want to find my brother's too.
[74:02.58]I was already in here.
[74:04.22]That's the oven.
[74:07.68]N.A.
[74:07.94]Throat.
[74:08.34]N.A.
[74:08.40]Throat.
[74:16.63]Nothing.
[74:21.09]There's a sledgehammer.
[74:22.95]I already have a sledgehammer.
[74:24.79]I'm going to take that one though.
[74:33.60]Guys, not everything needs to be classified as either North American or EU.
[74:42.61]Do you understand?
[74:43.23]Okay, we got one, two, three, four.
[74:48.93]I don't even know which ones I went to first.
[74:50.29]We're going to do the one on the ground.
[75:00.28]Didn't I already do this one?
[75:05.36]I already did this one didn't I god damn it where is it going upstairs uh-huh somebody's up here with me and into the like baby's room
[75:34.30]Mm-hmm.
[75:36.18]I have a sledgehammer.
[75:37.62]Get out of my way.
[75:38.48]It refuses to expand views.
[75:44.40]No.
[75:46.63]Not everything has to be like NA aim or EU aim.
[75:53.61]What about like fucking Mars?
[75:57.83]I like to think that I have Mars aim.
[76:02.60]Because it's just, like, the gravity on Mars is so much faster and so much tighter than Earth that I'm so much faster than everybody else.
[76:12.28]If you really want to, like, make fun of somebody, say they have, like, moon aim.
[76:17.19]What?
[76:20.19]This is the bad guy of the whole story.
[76:22.19]What?
[76:26.41]I'm gonna die.
[76:33.18]Yeah, moon aim.
[76:43.68]You know how slow you are on the moon?
[76:45.77]And how bad everybody is on the moon?
[76:52.65]Here he comes.
[76:53.75]We're gonna go with the door strategy.
[77:05.86]I don't think I can block him.
[77:06.88]Maybe I can.
[77:19.25]I just panicked.
[77:20.39]I panicked and pressed E a bunch of times and I ended up doing it.
[77:22.97]Yeah, open it up.
[77:34.87]How do I get under there?
[77:43.15]Damn it.
[77:54.95]This is just going back downstairs.
[77:57.72]So how do I get... I don't like this part of the game.
[78:07.42]I thought the sledgehammer would do it too, but there's no prompt to take it.
[78:12.73]What else is here?
[78:13.25]I can't, like, pry these off?
[78:25.86]Where did my sledgehammer go?
[78:26.72]Let me see.
[78:32.85]Crowbar.
[78:33.97]Sledgehammer.
[78:37.72]No.
[78:43.22]How do I get... There's gotta be a way to get over there.
[78:45.14]Do I have to jump around and go down and around?
[78:48.87]Can I, like, knock this shit down?
[78:54.93]That looks like it's moving.
[78:58.39]No?
[79:02.90]Well... Can I get on the top beam?
[79:11.98]I'm just a rope bow.
[79:16.82]Can I go up?
[79:18.92]No.
[79:19.56]Over here?
[79:21.16]No.
[79:22.24]It's the back.
[79:22.64]Let's go back down, isn't it?
[79:23.70]I don't think I've been this way.
[79:33.58]Shit.
[79:34.40]Huh.
[79:45.23]open the fridge now the fridge is downstairs what are you saying like you think I need to go to the fridge first oh well I can like go down here well we're just gonna do this because apparently I'm going down here now
[80:21.64]Found a thing.
[80:28.86]Open the fridge in real life.
[80:32.72]Why do you want to open my fridge?
[80:36.06]Watch out for the piano.
[80:43.96]Where does this go?
[80:45.48]This is the one that was already up here.
[80:47.12]So this one is different.
[80:51.35]Where do you go?
[80:52.13]In here.
[81:02.62]Last piece of the puzzle!
[81:07.49]I'm not gonna go open the fridge.
[81:16.37]So I'm the killer, I just am.
[81:22.81]Continue searching the house.
[81:30.21]Riddle, dark path to righteousness is beyond which you see yourself to be.
[81:33.96]It's like, I gotta go, there's a mirror.
[81:38.42]That's a mirror.
[81:39.24]That's a mirror reference.
[81:42.08]Hey, go look at the mirror.
[81:44.44]Okay.
[81:45.08]Where's the mirror?
[81:52.72]Dark path to the mirror.
[81:55.54]It's beyond the mirror.
[81:56.87]What you see yourself to be in the mirror.
[82:02.55]Okay.
[82:03.37]There was a big mirror over here somewhere.
[82:10.73]Anybody remember where that mirror is?
[82:28.53]body no look at your reflection in the fridge okay guys I'll open the fucking fridge here we go oh there's a dead bird in here see there was nothing even in there

[83:04.35]Where was- there was a gigantic mirror.
[83:06.87]I really just don't remember where the hell it is.
[83:08.37]Remember, I looked at it, I saw myself in it, and I was like, hey, that guy's very handsome.
[83:23.80]Where that was, I don't remember.
[83:27.22]The mirror was in the basement?
[83:32.26]Oh.
[83:33.10]Took too long, I got Luigi'd.
[83:34.30]I know it was a mirror.
[83:35.74]I know, I'm trying to remember what the mirror was.
[83:38.84]You don't have to give me the Luigi.
[84:01.93]Back down to the basement.
[84:04.09]Was there actually a mirror in the basement?
[84:18.26]Fuck me.
[84:22.96]Mirror!
[84:24.14]How do I even get down to the basement?
[84:29.04]Like, I'm so fucking lost already.
[84:33.46]Which way was the basement?
[84:38.90]That would help.
[84:39.72]I think I have to go up the stairs.
[84:44.14]For all I fucking remember.
[84:45.28]I'm just running in circles.
[85:02.92]Damn it.
[85:04.30]Oh, I get so turned around.

[85:35.46]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[85:38.36]There are like 45 doors in this person's house.
[85:43.21]Time to go to the basement.

[89:44.97]Wasn't it?
[89:45.25]Somebody count that.
[89:46.27]Remind, quick.
[89:48.47]Somebody remind and tell me.
[89:49.63]That was like at least nine or ten.
[89:56.79]I got it.
[90:00.57]That was fucking hard.
[90:01.17]That was harder than the game.
[90:04.39]Dude, tongue twisters, man?
[90:06.09]It's like Dark Souls for your mouth.
[90:12.22]Huh?
[90:12.46]Where is this guy?
[90:14.62]This guy's apparently hurt somewhere.
[90:32.57]Who is this guy?
[90:33.35]Is he in the fridge?
[90:41.35]I don't see anybody.
[90:47.88]My ears.
[90:49.14]My hands.
[90:49.98]I'm supposed to be scared by something, but I don't... Hey, bub.
[90:57.40]Other pianos.
[90:59.10]Sure do stink a lot.
[91:00.82]But not this guy.
[91:19.26]How do I get by this?
[91:26.18]Nope.
[91:29.36]Nope.
[91:43.52]Ow.
[91:44.24]No, don't do it.
[91:45.32]Not when I have this little health.
[91:46.40]That guy has a health pack on him.
[91:55.70]No.
[92:02.02]I need an axe.
[92:09.23]You counted the toy boats?
[92:10.21]It was 11.
[92:11.99]Because you gotta do it like ten times.
[92:14.99]I am... My lord.
[92:16.98]Turn off the lights.
[92:21.84]God damn it!
[92:26.18]Oh, good thing I hit you in the leg accidentally.
[92:30.89]What?
[92:36.91]I have no health.
[92:41.50]This is so bad.
[92:42.32]Hey, ask and ye shall receive.
[92:53.23]Where am I gonna get this fire axe that apparently exists?
[92:56.23]I need a fucking fire axe.
[93:01.80]I had one earlier.
[93:13.95]I think it is an unlimited hoard until I get to a fire axe, wherever the hell it is.
[93:33.46]Where is he?
[93:40.53]That was a loud scream.
[93:43.29]Do we have a crowbar?
[93:47.89]I need a crowbar.
[93:48.95]Who had a crowbar?
[93:52.11]Shovel, sledgehammer.
[93:56.45]None of you idiots have a crowbar?
[94:10.94]Why do you all have shovels?
[94:16.62]I left it upstairs?
[94:17.72]Did you see that guy's face?
[94:25.11]That guy had a terrifying look on his face.
[94:42.30]They never end.
[94:43.16]I'm just going to reload the safe.
[94:44.66]Give me the crowbar.
[94:45.14]Okay, where's the safe?
[94:51.55]God damn it.
[94:52.51]Get out of my fucking way.
[94:53.39]That guy's a fire axe.
[94:55.51]This dude is a fire axe.
[95:01.38]Okay, hold on.
[95:02.06]There's too many dead bodies here.
[95:03.94]I got to open up the safe.
[95:14.13]It was just a shotgun.
[95:15.07]Oh, and a machine gun, too.
[95:22.75]Okay, we're gonna use this.
[95:24.83]Fire axe is right there.
[95:30.13]Fire axe is, like, buried under somebody's body.
[95:31.89]Alright, get this out of here.
[95:46.59]Move it.
[95:47.19]Slide the piano.
[95:53.73]Thank you.
[95:55.49]SAVE.
[95:56.05]SAVE.
[96:09.00]Health kit.
[96:11.10]SAVE.
[96:11.30]SAVE.
[96:14.48]Oh, c'est la vie.
[96:17.14]You know what I'm saying?
[96:18.44]S-A-V-E.
[96:19.14]C'est la vie.
[96:24.42]Oh, the baby's room.
[96:25.52]Something happened in the baby's room.
[96:38.21]Find serial killer X and the torturer.
[96:41.35]Push the piano off landing and continue upstairs.
[96:45.52]You don't know what I'm saying.
[96:46.46]It's an old song that your mother definitely thinks is a good song.
[96:54.82]I'm certain of that.
[97:00.68]I like these double-jointed doors.
[97:12.39]Oh no, he's gonna use the detonator.
[97:22.27]I missed every shot.
[97:24.54]Let's investigate.
[97:27.00]One, two, three, four shots were fired.
[97:28.58]One.
[97:29.98]Two.
[97:35.06]Three.
[97:35.54]This is more important to me than the game.
[97:37.61]Four.
[97:37.91]I hit the TV.
[97:42.37]Okay.
[97:44.21]Let's go ahead and investigate this N.A.
[97:46.55]aim.
[97:46.97]Here it is.
[97:57.52]Again, more like Cheeto dust.
[97:59.88]What?
[98:00.10]It was on his fingers.
[98:03.01]It's right there.
[98:04.51]It's right there, man.
[98:11.31]It's right there.
[98:28.65]So this guy stabbed himself.
[98:32.39]Christ, it looks like serial killer X got to him, painted him up, tortured him, drove him to suicide, just like Anderson did to his victims.
[98:42.16]What the fuck was that?
[98:46.22]Tax dollars.
[98:47.22]Then play it your way.
[98:49.36]We'll find you.
[98:50.36]Count on it.
[99:18.23]I was doing a Will Ferrell thing there.
[99:19.61]If you didn't know.
[99:20.51]It's just me.
[99:23.93]I know it's me.
[99:46.40]Why would I smear his blood?
[99:58.73]Oh.
[99:59.55]I'm gonna pretend to be dead here.
[100:02.70]I gotta go with realism here, though.
[100:03.86]You know what I'm saying?
[100:06.26]I gotta stab myself directly into the stomach.
[100:10.26]Wait for it.
[100:12.10]Wait for it.
[100:14.59]Go right through the chest.
[100:15.31]He's not going to believe it.
[100:16.25]Wait for it.
[100:16.55]Now.
[100:16.63]Here we go.
[100:16.87]I can't shoot the taser.
[100:41.26]No, I ran out of stamina.
[100:43.45]Oh well.
[100:45.45]Oh well, I ran out of stamina.
[100:50.61]Oh.
[100:52.51]Uh, the chase sequence has to end early.
[100:54.62]I don't know where he went though.
[101:00.84]Oh.
[101:01.90]Why are you so much faster than me?
[101:22.05]Last boss.
[101:24.45]It's just me.
[101:25.05]I'm fighting Tyler Durden.
[101:33.36]Let's just cut him off.
[101:37.98]He's not gonna expect me.
[101:44.76]Just like, just like I used to do in Super Mario 64.
[101:47.03]Super Mario Kart 64.
[101:50.17]When you know you're gonna lose, you turn around and just drive the other way and try to fuck up everybody else that's in first place.
[102:02.62]What the hell is he?
[102:13.21]Okay.
[102:16.19]Give me a fucking break.
[102:17.55]My whole body hurts.
[102:18.89]My entire body hurts.
[102:22.09]I'm so annoyed right now.
[102:26.12]God.
[102:35.18]I'm gonna lose now.
[102:38.42]No, I'm not.
[102:38.94]God damn it.
[102:39.71]That scared the... See, I'm the killer.
[102:46.89]That's the psychiatrist.
[102:47.89]He's been fucking with my head the whole time, and I'm the guy that's been killing everybody.
[103:00.96]Leland.
[103:02.32]Nephew, please listen to me.
[103:04.80]I am here to help.
[103:06.52]You are not yourself.
[103:07.70]You are not in your right mind.
[103:09.54]Let me help you.
[103:11.60]I know of what I speak.
[103:13.03]I...
[103:14.60]Oh no, he's the Cincinnati Strangler all along!
[103:24.18]We're gonna be getting pretty close here.
[103:34.73]Nephew.
[103:38.85]Welcome to consciousness, my friend.
[103:41.71]Though you won't enjoy it long.
[103:45.73]were good in the beginning yeah that's me and me Tyler durden to be kind of a failure didn't you you still don't get it I've been using you Ethan Thomas I watched you finkel is einhorn followed you and used you to find the serial killers you so desperately sought and then killed them okay
[104:14.19]I must admit, I was a bit dramatic.
[104:18.41]Killed them the same way they'd kill their own victims.
[104:22.47]A bit of fun, you know?
[104:24.47]I got good at it.
[104:26.35]Shame it ruined you at the Bureau.
[104:29.57]But some things are unavoidable.
[104:31.37]Don't put that so close to me.
[104:34.35]Since you're no longer going to be any help, there's no reason to go on this way.
[104:39.14]So I'm gonna kill, am I supposed to stab myself?
[104:43.05]I didn't like the torturers methods much too risky perhaps a slit across the throat like the roadside carver ah short and sweet what if I get to pick one two three or four the bone cutter neatly dissected the body removed the internal organs and labeled them for the police to find oh yes he was one of mine too
[105:08.74]What the hell?
[105:10.74]Who's like the samurai on the... Oh, that's like the teeth guy.
[105:15.42]Hunt down and destroy the one responsible for all this.
[105:38.87]Well, you know, we could all just burn, because all of us are fucking awful people.
[105:44.94]And then fall over.
[105:59.75]That's not the right way.
[106:09.40]Ah, I got some fire!
[106:16.84]Where do I go with this?
[106:20.46]Hey, Dad?
[106:22.96]Dad, where do I go from here?
[106:24.24]Um...
[106:40.29]Dad?
[106:43.89]Dad?
[106:45.43]See, some of you have me on, like, a loud speaker right now.
[106:48.97]And your dad is actually probably gonna be like, what's happening out there?
[106:54.05]Hey, Dad, can I have a snack?
[106:57.92]Got you.
[107:07.64]Do I gotta fight the...
[107:09.59]The mad doctor with the flaming stick.
[107:18.14]Final boss.
[107:22.82]Fight the madness within.
[107:32.17]No.
[107:39.16]Bicycle pump.
[107:40.88]Nope.
[107:41.48]Climb over.
[107:42.58]Nope.
[107:46.48]The madness within two.
[107:53.75]Where the hell am I going?
[108:01.49]Found a house.
[108:02.53]A hut.
[108:03.51]To be more precise.
[108:06.98]And in here is...
[108:09.95]Nothing.
[108:15.95]Just going on a walk.
[108:26.54]Find and confront the darkness.
[108:32.76]Um.
[108:33.88]Well.
[108:36.82]Complicates things a little.
[108:37.86]I guess I have to go back.
[108:51.47]Okay.
[108:54.13]Back here.
[108:55.25]This is where the fire was.
[108:56.35]Okay, well, I found the checkpoint.
[109:06.36]Did I have to go, like, a certain way?
[109:10.50]No, here he comes.
[109:13.16]Is that my inner madness?
[109:23.79]Is he dead?
[109:25.11]Not quite.
[109:25.51]Is he gonna throw up?
[109:30.33]Oh, he's just spitting.
[109:31.09]I keep knocking teeth out.
[109:32.20]Alright, let's end this.
[109:39.64]Next snap, I would say.
[109:45.72]Madness averted.
[109:54.42]It was a zombie.
[109:55.31]I don't have the taser anymore.
[110:01.15]I'm just realizing this now.
[110:07.81]I don't think I'm supposed to go this far.
[110:10.65]I'm going way far away from the estate.
[110:12.60]Oh no, here he is.
[110:14.42]Gonna jump the fence?
[110:20.66]Eventually?
[110:26.82]He's in the fridge.
[110:30.69]Okay, I gotta walk up to the fridge and find him.
[110:34.41]I see you.
[110:36.05]Skeleton.
[110:37.71]Any more skeletons?
[110:38.35]Yep.
[110:40.96]I'm gonna back against the wall here, because I'm not getting swarmed by skeletons right now.
[110:45.28]Oh, shit.
[110:45.96]Yes, I am.
[110:58.62]Shit, I missed.
[111:01.54]Really?
[111:01.82]Come on, give me a break.
[111:05.26]God damn, this is just like two drunk idiots flailing at each other.
[111:13.60]God damn it!
[111:15.37]God damn it!
[111:18.55]Can this please end?
[111:20.01]How are you hitting me from that far away?
[111:22.75]Alright, we're just dancing.
[111:28.64]What are those people called?
[111:29.60]What are those people called?
[111:30.80]The people that dance with the string around them?
[111:33.58]They have a stick with a streamer on it and they fling it around and they dance around and it spins all around them.
[111:38.52]What is it called?
[111:44.27]You guys know exactly what I mean.
[111:46.59]They have that metal rod and on top of the metal rod is a long streamer.
[111:52.50]and they spin and it goes around their bodies and it looks really cool and like I've been to nine of these shows, but I just don't know what they're called.
[112:03.28]Jesus Christ.
[112:12.73]Come on, do I have to really look this up?
[112:20.79]Oh, apples to apples?
[112:21.81]I prefer cards against humanity.
[112:23.37]Hey, what is this?
[112:31.02]Apples to apples?
[112:32.30]I prefer cards against humanity.
[112:41.22]Where do I go?
[112:49.96]That was for the video.
[112:50.76]That could be for the video.
[112:53.28]I did a better take.
[112:54.96]Don't you guys understand acting and directing?
[112:57.95]Don't you guys understand filmmaking?
[113:02.39]You guys are witnessing a film being made.
[113:05.29]Let's just grab this one.
[113:18.72]Acting.
[113:23.78]I don't have a flashlight anymore either.
[113:32.99]There can be a guy on the... You guys didn't make it far.
[113:42.80]You guys didn't make it that far, did you?
[113:47.60]All of second Jerma is scripted.
[113:51.14]No, it's not.
[113:52.20]Moot's not.
[113:53.68]Somebody else up there.
[114:07.23]I knew it.
[114:08.53]I don't want to use this here.
[114:09.25]This guy dies in one hit.
[114:11.23]No.
[114:12.27]Fuck.
[114:12.67]I don't have...
[114:19.29]At least I know it's there.
[114:20.07]Alright, let's spin this around, because I'm going to need to use this.
[114:22.79]No, I don't.
[114:26.89]Okay, I just got... Now I need to use it.
[114:30.14]Right in the face.
[114:31.34]Okay, well, that didn't even hurt him.
[114:40.48]Fuck you.
[114:45.33]Get the weapons broken.
[114:46.49]I need to go back and get health now.
[114:51.84]He's right behind me!
[114:54.06]Can I go get this?
[114:54.90]I need another stick.
[115:03.33]Give me that.
[115:06.77]Oh, shit.
[115:07.31]Snap his neck.
[115:11.65]There we are.
[115:12.34]Okay.
[115:23.68]3, 2, 1.
[115:28.64]Finally got the fire.
[115:29.40]That was interesting.
[115:30.44]Health pack over there.
[115:31.85]What's this?
[115:33.99]Apples to apples, huh?
[115:36.85]That's interesting.
[115:37.69]Although I'd rather play cards against humanity.
[115:39.25]3, 2, 1, end.
[115:54.64]That's how they all do it.
[115:55.88]That's how all your favorite YouTubers do it, by the way.
[116:00.26]That's how they all do it.
[116:08.58]There he is.
[116:08.98]What the fuck?
[116:11.90]Why would you count down the end?
[116:13.00]I know.
[116:13.48]There's not a good reason.
[116:23.13]That's it, right?
[116:24.46]I win.
[116:25.50]I did it.
[116:25.84]I beat the, I beat the length of the game.
[116:30.46]Two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, three, two, one, clear it, clear it, sync, sync the audio, sync the audio, three, two, one.
[116:39.06]I have like nothing to say.
[116:41.54]Cut, clip it, cut it here.
[116:55.78]Sink the audio.
[116:58.82]I need to start doing that.
[117:01.11]I say this, I need to start doing that.
[117:03.53]The game is over in like 31 minutes.
[117:06.59]I gotta start to learn how to block.
[117:08.19]The game's over in 10 minutes.
[117:13.17]You guys gonna fight?
[117:14.01]Thank god you're doing it.
[117:15.01]Thank goodness.
[117:18.05]Does that anger you?
[117:20.32]You two ribbon dancers?
[117:29.04]I love this so much.
[117:33.00]You guys couldn't be stupider.
[117:34.50]It's perfect every time.
[117:38.98]They just don't even mean to.
[117:40.16]It's so great.
[117:47.59]I keep trying to block it.
[117:50.05]Like that.
[117:57.28]I think there's one more health kit in here that I can get.
[118:00.40]There it is.
[118:05.61]Save it.
[118:09.59]Those guys are flashy as fuck.
[118:10.95]Yeah, they really are.
[118:12.47]They're wonderful specimens.
[118:16.87]No climb?
[118:20.71]No climb, just walk.
[118:23.56]Let that stamina recharge because I'm probably going to need it.
[118:31.24]Somebody else.
[118:34.54]Don't get collapsed on.
[118:35.82]Somebody behind me.
[118:45.94]Not quite.
[118:50.78]You must confront yourself.
[118:52.52]These are...
[119:05.41]I thought those were both me.
[119:06.69]I'm not even kidding.
[119:08.25]Those were both me.
[119:10.01]I freaked out.
[119:10.59]I thought it was a mirror coming around the corner.
[119:16.05]Block the bullet.
[119:17.43]That's what I was attempting to do.
[119:19.13]Didn't work out so well.
[119:27.50]I was trying to get him to shoot the guy in front of me.
[119:36.42]He tried.
[119:43.32]What is this?
[119:43.96]Nothing?
[119:45.44]Alright.
[119:46.18]Here we go.
[119:47.40]This is it.
[119:49.70]This is the end here.
[119:51.00]They've given us with one last little... One last little checkpoint.
[119:58.44]Got him.
[120:00.00]I win.
[120:02.50]I win the whole game.
[120:05.85]Try to go through the door.
[120:06.65]I can't climb this?
[120:21.95]He'll figure it out.
[120:44.92]Oh, what a waste.
[120:46.06]What a waste.
[120:49.85]Oh, man.
[120:50.49]What a waste.
[120:53.83]My terrible, terrible attempt.
[120:58.21]God damn it.
[121:04.19]Just die.
[121:18.75]He cocks up like that.
[121:20.33]We don't need to do a stylized kill on him.
[121:27.16]Just get rid of him.
[121:31.06]Does it have any bolts?
[121:33.42]No, it doesn't.
[121:38.18]Any more guns on the table up here?
[121:52.44]And we move.
[121:56.12]What would it be?
[121:56.62]Bird.
[121:57.17]There was a bird that I missed?
[121:59.99]It's too dark to see the birds, guys.
[122:04.45]It's dark in here.
[122:08.15]Where did I miss the bird?
[122:11.56]There he is.
[122:11.98]Okay.
[122:15.20]So... In 3, 2, 1, go.
[122:23.42]One fat guy, two fat guy, three fat guy, triple!
[122:27.69]Ba- what's this?
[122:30.03]Apples... Apples to apples.
[122:34.21]Fuck that game.
[122:35.12]Cods Against Humanity is way better.
[122:50.20]I love how fucking... How much everyone hates this.
[122:55.37]This guy's good.
[123:06.03]Take it slow.
[123:09.59]He didn't even do a move.
[123:12.26]Got him stunlocked against the... What?
[123:16.22]Oh, nice.
[123:16.52]I can do both of them?
[123:17.28]I can do both?
[123:19.12]No, I can't.
[123:21.82]They do less damage.
[123:22.66]These things are terrible.
[123:23.66]That's against humanity.
[123:33.47]Ay-yi-yi.
[123:41.81]Is this going to be my house that I burnt down or something?
[123:45.07]And in the anguish and the mental torment, I split into two personalities because my whole house burnt down?
[123:55.31]I can understand that.
[123:57.43]That would make sense.
[124:09.97]Well.
[124:12.39]Here we are.
[124:13.77]See, this is my stick collection.
[124:18.19]Here I am.
[124:23.30]Walking around the house.
[124:28.20]Wait, there's more than one stick dentist?
[124:37.13]Is he going to jump down?
[124:37.83]I don't care who you are.
[124:43.73]That really hurts.
[124:46.53]Accidentally killed.
[124:53.04]This guy's got the top tier weapon.
[125:02.09]I want that thing, please.
[125:08.17]That's what I want.
[125:08.89]Forget about the stick.
[125:10.41]This is where it's at.
[125:11.19]Alright, here we go.
[125:13.53]Marth V. Marth.
[125:14.71]Diddy Kong versus Diddy Kong.
[125:25.12]Where is he going?
[125:28.50]He went to go pick up a new one.
[125:32.02]Mark.
[125:32.84]Anybody else behind me?
[125:38.36]No.
[125:41.13]He went to get another new one.
[125:43.97]Why?
[125:46.03]Jesus.
[125:51.73]Alright, I do actually need to take one of these.
[125:56.85]So many people in here!
[125:57.91]God damn it, man!
[126:01.51]Oh, no, no, everybody's gonna have one.
[126:27.58]God damn it man.
[126:31.65]I just got seeing stars.
[126:34.27]That's not good myself like an aneurysm
[126:42.69]He was just waiting for me.
[126:45.73]I didn't know what he was going to do to me.
[126:47.33]He wanted to kill me.
[126:49.75]He hit me directly in the fucking face.
[126:53.87]Oh man, that was funny.
[126:56.31]I had like 50 or 60% HP too.
[127:01.15]The reason why that's so funny is because that's actually what would happen to you if someone did that.
[127:05.81]You would instantly die.
[127:12.86]Good choice.
[127:13.60]Okay, I gotta, like, slow down here.
[127:17.06]Here he is again.
[127:18.10]No, not part two.
[127:19.44]I'm not gonna let this happen again.
[127:22.24]He knows the strategy this time.
[127:23.66]I'm gonna... Oh, God.
[127:28.81]Okay, here we go.
[127:31.31]Where is he?
[127:35.49]What are you... That almost happened.
[127:42.89]Shit.
[127:43.79]Shit.
[127:49.74]They're learning.
[127:54.62]Look at how much damage that did.
[127:55.98]That didn't even do like 20% of my damage.
[128:02.56]Die.
[128:03.12]Jesus.
[128:07.92]I love this game.
[128:09.82]What a classic fucking game.
[128:11.10]This is great.
[128:13.72]He's hiding over here.
[128:24.19]Do it.
[128:27.29]There you go.
[128:32.79]Part two.
[128:39.57]Here we go, he's gonna kill these guys for me.
[128:42.77]Oh, fuck no!
[128:43.77]Where am I?
[128:44.53]He just knocked me into hell.
[128:46.13]Oh, easy.
[128:47.60]Where is he?
[128:49.24]God damn it!
[128:56.62]Oh, God!
[128:58.64]Okay, pay attention and get it right.
[129:02.69]Why did he knock me across the whole map?
[129:04.96]It's that same guy.
[129:06.72]Why is this damage and knockback multiplied by like 12?
[129:25.06]Can I get up these?
[129:26.69]I can't get up that.
[129:31.67]Come on.
[129:32.41]Bring them out.
[129:33.45]Here they come.
[129:34.33]Okay, cool.
[129:41.14]Give me this.
[129:41.60]I'm not fucking around anymore.
[129:52.89]Just keep them doing that.
[129:53.77]Keep them spinning around.
[129:59.81]Gain some stamina.
[130:01.69]Save it here.
[130:02.95]I can see him through the wall.
[130:04.27]He ain't fooling anybody.
[130:10.40]You see a tooth?
[130:11.86]A tooth.
[130:13.24]More teeth.
[130:17.98]Okay, good.
[130:18.54]Save it.
[130:19.04]Here we go.
[130:19.50]This is where I have all the issues.
[130:21.40]Is with this guy.
[130:25.47]He's so much better.
[130:26.25]He blocks...
[130:30.80]I just double tapped him, that's good.
[130:43.99]Guys, a fire axe, guess I need it.
[130:47.07]That's not a block?
[130:48.59]In what world is that not a block?
[130:52.49]Don't do it, please God!
[131:01.33]I'm gonna get like two of those guys at the same time, aren't I?
[131:08.27]No, don't even.
[131:09.03]Don't do it.
[131:14.48]Why?
[131:14.86]Nobody wants to see the apples to apples thing again.
[131:20.36]Oh shit.
[131:35.22]Get him, please.
[131:43.85]I'm hitting him twice.
[131:45.55]He's going to hit like five times.
[131:49.81]Do you hear that?
[131:51.71]Keep going.
[132:00.98]No, don't lose.
[132:03.06]Don't lose.
[132:03.68]Don't lose.
[132:04.92]I need to get the health behind him.
[132:07.24]I need to get the health back behind him.
[132:09.34]Okay, I'm going to run this way.
[132:13.04]Oh my god, he's right there.
[132:14.50]Jesus Christ.
[132:17.26]Save it.
[132:36.45]This is too much.
[132:38.73]Where is he going?
[132:39.39]What are you doing?
[132:44.45]Where are you going?
[132:50.35]That's it, right?
[132:53.55]Whoa!
[132:59.42]Okay, I did not expect the fucking samurai to come down.
[133:08.16]I'm sorry, man.
[133:08.66]You cannot fuck.
[133:09.80]You can't fuck with this.
[133:13.82]Wooden Plank versus Dex.
[133:16.02]Dex loser.
[133:17.81]You think you can fuck?
[133:18.39]I'm like the one asshole in Dark Souls that put all the points into strength and took the door weapon.
[133:24.21]This guy is like a try-hard PvP Dex guy.
[133:27.37]Nope.
[133:34.19]Any more health?
[133:44.32]Nice moves.
[133:46.70]Fancy shit.
[133:47.36]Too bad it's not gonna save you.
[133:52.96]What am I doing?
[134:00.65]Um... What's going on here?
[134:07.93]Oh no.
[134:10.07]Health.
[134:10.71]Health is important here.
[134:11.99]Give it to me.
[134:21.53]Okay.
[134:23.19]I got it saved.
[134:32.09]Get the axe.
[134:34.39]I don't want to do the axe, man.
[134:35.57]This thing is so much better.
[134:37.55]I'm so much better with the wooden door than I am anything else.
[134:52.91]Look at these, like, fancy moves.
[134:57.87]Look, I'm just pressing R1.
[135:00.38]He's trying to do all his, like, weapon art shit.
[135:02.30]Oh, whoa, cool spin, man!
[135:04.20]R1.
[135:05.76]R1.
[135:09.30]Okay, you got, like, the wolf sword from Bloodborne.
[135:11.70]Interesting.
[135:12.50]Oh, cool.
[135:13.30]R1.
[135:13.38]What else are you gonna show me?
[135:16.85]Nice try.
[135:17.35]That was like an L2 into an R1.
[135:20.45]Not this time.
[135:27.07]Oh shit, be careful here.
[135:29.11]Oh, he's dead.
[135:33.13]I have to stamina.
[135:35.43]Did I win?
[135:39.29]I think I have to pull his face off next.
[135:40.81]I gotta rip his mask off now.
[135:45.43]One more fight.
[135:47.07]The last fight is rip off his mask and it's me.
[135:51.61]What am I doing?
[135:53.95]Oh.
[135:55.39]A health pick.
[135:56.55]A health pick.
[135:58.20]Final battle.
[135:59.82]One health pack.
[136:02.02]Wait.
[136:02.62]Wouldn't that be considered BM?
[136:03.84]Because I'm like healing.
[136:04.72]I don't give a shit.
[136:06.58]I leveled up the door.
[136:07.80]You think I give a shit about like using an Estus right now?
[136:26.24]I walked into that.
[136:32.24]I might lose this.
[136:40.37]Fuck!
[136:40.73]I did it again!
[136:41.37]What?
[136:56.36]I just, like, knocked the sense back into him.
[136:58.14]Great.
[136:59.64]He goes, one, two, and then he does three.
[137:02.98]Here it comes.
[137:03.28]He's gonna go, wah, forward, lunge, forward, forward.
[137:08.07]Do it again.
[137:10.15]No, I knocked him out.
[137:12.35]Wait, I was supposed to grab him.
[137:13.43]I was supposed to grab him.
[137:14.05]I was supposed to grab him.
[137:17.49]Got him.
[137:22.50]Off comes the saw mask.
[137:31.12]Disgusting.
[137:44.35]The whole house is exploding.
[137:52.03]And here comes... Here comes Uncle.
[137:55.54]Malcolm.
[137:57.55]Why is everybody calling me different names?
[137:58.88]Oh no, that's me.
[138:01.16]Put your hands up.
[138:09.92]You're under arrest.
[138:20.53]What?
[138:24.94]I can never go back, Anna.
[138:27.35]No, not to the Bureau, not to your old life.
[138:33.05]Wasn't this guy in the shed?
[138:34.23]Thomas, you have looked into the face of hate, the visage of evil.
[138:39.64]Know that hate is in your soul, too.
[138:43.46]It is, sadly, everywhere.
[138:46.93]Mastering one's fear and controlling one's hatred is perhaps the most difficult thing one can do.
[138:52.63]Well, at least it's over.
[138:55.27]It's dead, and the killings will stop.
[139:03.96]Stop the car.
[139:05.44]No, no, you still don't understand.
[139:08.76]He's done unspeakable things, even though those he killed were killers themselves.
[139:14.72]But he isn't responsible.
[139:17.71]He's not in his right mind.
[139:18.91]Please stop the goddamn car now.
[139:25.33]I don't understand.
[139:29.07]So wait a minute.
[139:30.21]Are there two people or is this... Or is this where Condemned 2 takes a place?
[139:35.51]Do I get out of the car and this is the first level?
[139:41.75]Thomas, don't!
[139:43.96]He was a good boy.
[139:45.84]We were all good people.
[139:47.98]We were able to fight it back, most of us.
[139:50.94]My nephew was not as strong.
[139:52.72]He fell victim and destroyed so many things.
[139:56.77]We fought to save him.
[139:58.69]I must continue to do so.
[140:01.01]I don't care whether this sick fuck is in his right mind or not.
[140:05.05]Think of what you are doing Both of you have a chance for redemption.
[140:09.64]Yeah, it's just me redemption Listen old man, you used me just like he did you you used me to save your precious nephew a serial killer You you're no better than he is What happens here
[140:29.51]Uh-oh.
[140:30.33]And see, now we were talking and paying attention and the AI director spawned a bunch of fucking monsters.
[140:35.09]Good job, Grandpa.
[140:40.09]How does it end?
[140:40.74]Your companion... Five seconds!
[140:56.99]I didn't mean... Wait, that was... Five seconds is not a lot of time.
[141:03.30]That was the only time I had.
[141:04.66]See, that was the way I had to do that.
[141:05.96]That was fun.
[141:27.02]yes very odd a cult seems to be behind all this it's a bad end there's only two endings apparently investigated by your department a cult the man responsible was leland van horn
[141:40.79]Yes, I know.
[141:42.37]He manipulated both you and us.
[141:44.27]But where is he?
[141:45.19]We have no Leland Van Horn in custody.
[141:48.59]He... How many coats is he wearing?
[141:50.55]I've explained all of this in my deposition to the Bureau.
[141:53.47]But a lot of unanswered questions remain, Thomas.
[141:56.00]Which brings me to why I'm here.
[141:57.96]Flip the coin, we've got the bad ending.
[141:59.50]Whoops.
[141:59.64]Maybe we'd have a better sense of all this if more were found, but...
[142:03.32]What if you shoot the old man?
[142:04.36]You can't.
[142:04.84]I tried.
[142:05.74]I tried to move the mouse.
[142:06.64]I was going to shoot him instantly in the face.
[142:10.61]Five seconds.
[142:11.13]You know how long five seconds is?
[142:12.93]One, two, three, four, five.
[142:16.27]Decision.
[142:17.77]I made that decision in like three and a half seconds.
[142:20.91]I didn't have that much.
[142:21.55]Give me like 10 seconds.
[142:22.43]Give me 15 seconds.
[142:29.56]Of course you can trust me, Thomas.
[142:31.48]We've been through a lot together.
[142:32.58]I'm weird.
[142:33.28]Oh, wait, she's wearing a wire.
[142:36.34]I have no idea what any of it means.
[142:40.08]Something weird, something unexplainable happened during my investigation.
[142:43.22]But truthfully, the questions you ask, I just, I can't answer.
[142:48.30]I'm sorry, Rosa.
[142:49.70]I'm sorry too, Thomas.
[142:51.36]I really am.
[142:53.44]And right before we get the save game end credits, I'm escaping.
[142:56.03]We're going to see the other ending.
[143:01.04]I'm into weird shit.
[143:02.63]Oh.
[143:03.47]Okay.
[143:06.57]And here we... What is this?
[143:09.05]I take control of the game again?
[143:12.25]No?
[143:21.55]Another zit?
[143:24.49]That was a big one.
[143:26.83]He just hit his head and green blood came out.
[143:30.92]Nobody throws up like that.
[143:32.12]Okay.
[143:43.81]So, here we are.
[143:44.55]Quick load.
[143:48.22]Let's get the good end.
[143:59.75]Well, hold on.
[144:00.15]The good... Let's get... Okay, there's the good end.
[144:03.67]There's one of the other endings.
[144:04.61]I die.
[144:07.63]Let's do the other end and see what happens.
[144:11.57]I didn't pick up the health pack.
[144:15.57]Don't even give him a second to do anything.
[144:19.07]Just burger boy technique, this guy.
[144:22.13]That's what I should have done from the very beginning.
[144:33.37]Grab his mask.
[144:34.83]Okay, here we go.
[144:37.24]Let's see what happens on the other end.
[144:38.82]Game over.
[144:47.54]We did it.
[144:54.79]Maybe I'm bad at paying attention.
[145:06.25]Alright, we can't skip this, so... Can I save it?
[145:09.21]I cannot save right now.
[145:10.59]Can I save during the decision?
[145:20.42]I thought this game was about fighting.
[145:28.32]Like, crackheads.
[145:31.23]I'm actually confused of what happened in this game.
[145:35.19]Yes, we are going to play Condemned 2.
[145:37.81]I have Condemned 2, but I figured we would do the first one first, not just play the second one.
[145:43.79]I can never go back.
[145:44.73]We will play Condemned 2, but not immediately.
[145:47.42]Not to the Bureau, not to your own life.
[145:48.56]Maybe like at some point next week.
[145:51.48]We'll start Condemned 2.
[145:52.32]Thomas, you have looked into the face of hate, the visage of evil.
[145:58.52]Know that hate is in your soul, too.
[146:02.32]It is, sadly, everywhere.
[146:05.80]Mastering one's fear and controlling one's hatred is perhaps the most difficult thing one can do.
[146:10.55]At least it's over.
[146:12.51]It's dead, and the killings will stop.
[146:14.27]We'll stop the car.
[146:15.07]No, no, you still don't understand.
[146:27.74]He's done unspeakable things, even though those he killed were killers themselves.
[146:32.24]Maybe we'll start Condemn 2 on maybe Friday?
[146:35.32]Next week, Friday?
[146:36.66]He's not in his right mind.
[146:38.58]Stop the goddamn car, now!
[146:40.88]Still gonna play Zoombinis, that's true.
[146:42.41]Yeah, let's try to instantly save it, so we can make sure our decision is right.
[146:55.67]Open the trunk.
[146:57.11]Yeah, and unfortunately this game, Condemned 2, is not on PC.
[147:01.25]It's only on Xbox 360 and PS3.
[147:02.75]So I'm gonna have to deal with analog for the whole game, which I'll get used to it.
[147:06.42]I'll deal with it.
[147:07.20]Time for the good boy ending.
[147:23.96]Think of what you are doing both of you have a chance for redemption Redemption listen old man.
[147:31.71]You used me just like he did you you used me to save your precious nephew I'm not gonna shoot him again.
[147:37.77]We spent so much time doing it Can I save it
[147:55.58]here we go save game okay quick save got it we saved it so I got five seconds and I can't move I can't go anywhere it's the same nothing changes what the what are you
[148:29.14]Does it change?
[148:30.04]You really know how to impress a lady.
[148:32.08]He just does it himself.
[148:33.26]Around here, people keep to themselves.
[148:35.70]Why the lay low routine?
[148:37.28]Yeah, he points at me.
[148:38.37]He points at him.
[148:39.09]Nope, I'll just do it to me.
[148:42.03]Shoot the gun out of his hand?
[148:44.33]Yeah, tough break.
[148:46.57]Man, you look like... I'm going to shoot the gun out of his hand.
[148:55.31]That didn't... I don't think I have an opportunity to do that.
[149:01.50]His hands are tied.
[149:02.30]How does he get a gun?
[149:04.43]No, I have no control now.
[149:18.36]There's nothing I can do here.
[149:19.64]It's the same thing every time.
[149:30.66]Okay.
[149:30.90]Alright, let's see the other ending.
[149:33.37]I think I broke the game.
[149:37.35]Let's see if the dialogue is any different.
[149:58.90]You probably need all the birds and metal.
[150:00.36]You know, that might be true.
[150:05.51]You probably need to get all the birds.
[150:06.43]You really know how to impress a lady, Thomas.
[150:09.45]Around here, people keep to themselves.
[150:11.93]Why the lay low routine?
[150:13.11]Well, let's just watch this again.
[150:14.39]I've been cleared of the murders, but my suspension has got me thinking.
[150:17.78]I guess I just, I don't know who to trust anymore.
[150:20.52]Yeah, tough break.
[150:22.64]Beat the game on PSVR.
[150:25.00]Yeah, I've been better.
[150:26.32]You said you found something interesting.
[150:28.97]Yes, very odd.
[150:31.49]A cult seems to be behind all this.
[150:33.99]We can tie them to the deaths of the serial killers investigated by your part.
[150:36.87]But condemned to... I'll have to set up the police station for you.
[150:42.73]This is a good game, though.
[150:45.18]This was a great game.
[150:46.58]This hit all the notes.
[150:48.04]The gameplay was fun.
[150:48.58]It was interesting enough.
[150:49.48]It was funny.
[150:49.82]It was just fucking crazy.
[150:50.48]It was just outrageous.
[150:52.44]There were lots of interesting moments, a lot of jump scares, a lot of funny scares, interesting scares, epic.
[151:13.86]Do you know anything about this?
[151:15.90]Who these people are?
[151:16.80]Wait, is this different?
[151:17.48]Are you affiliated with them in any way?
[151:21.04]Rosa, can I trust you?
[151:28.77]What if it says something different?
[151:29.83]Oh, that would be so funny if that was written something differently.
[151:31.95]Of course you can trust me, Thomas.
[151:33.61]What if she just wrote, epic.
[151:39.24]Look, I have no idea what any of it means.
[151:42.32]I hate it.
[151:42.72]Something unexplainable happened during my investigation.
[151:45.26]But truthfully, the questions you ask, I just, I can't answer.
[151:49.79]I'm sorry, Rosa.
[151:51.77]I'm sorry too, Thomas.
[151:53.45]I really am.
[151:57.55]Take care of yourself.
[151:59.13]So they haven't made very many games, but the Shadow of War, Shadow of Mordor devs, they've just made like a bunch of really good games, haven't they?
[152:10.48]They made these two games.
[152:12.08]They made the Fear games.
[152:13.22]Although, isn't Fear 3 kind of like a piece of shit?
[152:17.20]But... Pretty much everything Monolith makes is fairly good.
[152:22.58]They're a pretty solid developer, considering that they've had a track record of making just good stuff.
[152:26.92]Alright, here we go.
[152:35.23]Let's see what happens.
[152:39.84]post-credits scene.
[152:43.26]Um... Is that not the end of the game?
[152:49.33]Wow!
[152:49.91]Got loud!
[152:50.71]Pretty real quickly here!
[152:52.73]Jesus!
[152:53.45]Alright, cool.
[152:56.73]What if there's more?
[152:57.87]Like, I slaughter the people in the diner.
[153:00.63]Now you're the psycho!
[153:01.53]Kill everybody!
[153:02.07]Alright.
[153:06.88]I got bird... I got a couple of bird awards.
[153:14.50]You can just play by chapter.
[153:16.58]That's interesting.
[153:17.28]Just in case you want to show one of your friends something cool.
[153:23.00]Alright, well.
[153:25.30]That's Condemned 1.
[153:26.60]Criminal Origins.
[153:31.48]Oh, that feeling when you sneeze and your skin flies off.
[153:35.74]Alright, we're not going to end the stream yet.
[153:39.10]We're going to do something else for like an hour or two.
[153:42.06]Maybe like an hour or so.
[153:44.47]Let me just pee.
[153:45.05]Let me figure out what I want to move to for a little bit.
[153:51.52]And I will see you guys in a minute.
[153:55.15]Just give me like two or three minutes.
[153:56.55]If you just came for Condemned, then I'll see you guys on the next stream.
[154:01.41]If not, then stay tuned.
[154:02.35]We'll do something else for like an hour.
[154:04.20]I'll be right back.
