[00:10.10]This guy has a sniper rifle pointing in the air, and he's just like... Oh, he's humping.
[00:14.72]Yeah, what is that?
[00:15.62]Oh, yeah, he's getting down.
[00:17.98]I have never seen that before.
[00:20.90]It's just ridiculous.
[00:22.24]Yeah, what you do is you crouch, look up, and you scope in.
[00:25.56]Yeah, that's what you do.
[00:26.98]Oh, really?
[00:27.70]Yeah.
[00:29.38]Alright.
[00:30.79]I'm going to play soldier this round.
[00:31.87]What are you doing?
[00:33.13]Actually, no, I'll just pocket you.
[00:34.87]Alright.
[00:37.19]Where'd you go?
[00:37.61]Where'd you go?
[00:38.29]Left side.
[00:41.81]So I'm going Stock Rocket Launcher, Shotgun, and Equalizer.
[00:46.27]You're going Kritzkrieg.
[00:48.65]Blutsauger and the Ubersaw.
[00:50.57]There we go.
[00:53.94]I also got a request that we got to try, like, legit battle medics where you have two medics and you try to chain an uber.
[00:59.44]Oh, hell yeah.
[01:00.20]I've never done it before.
[01:01.38]It looks very difficult.
[01:03.48]It can get pretty crazy because, I mean, you can end up having an uber for a full two or three minutes on each side.
[01:10.62]It's pretty insane.
[01:13.36]Alright, grab that health.
[01:14.80]Alright, cap this point.
[01:20.42]Overheal everybody.
[01:25.05]Where you going, Scout?
[01:26.21]Not happening.
[01:27.23]Nice, nice.
[01:29.71]Alright, let me know when you want it.
[01:31.69]Oh, Baxter.
[01:33.51]Oh, I got him.
[01:34.19]I'll revenge you.
[01:35.61]I'll avenge you, not revenge you.
[01:37.39]Oh, God.
[01:37.95]Never mind.
[01:40.04]I just walked right into a direct hit.
[01:42.86]TF2 double X Frank was not having any of that one.
[01:49.11]Double X Frank.
[01:51.93]That's a perfect name.
[01:53.15]There you are.
[01:57.33]Nice.
[01:57.83]Good carry.
[02:00.03]Why would a Pyro just be sitting there?
[02:03.67]Yeah, true.
[02:05.35]They should be herping and derping somewhere.
[02:10.40]This looks like it might just be a GG right here.
[02:13.98]Yeah.
[02:14.44]It's kind of rolling through.
[02:15.64]Let's go take that last point.
[02:21.78]Slowly but surely.
[02:23.80]Got two medics on you now.
[02:26.25]Oh.
[02:27.43]We got a heavy.
[02:32.25]I'm backing up.
[02:33.21]Yeah, back up for a little bit.
[02:36.13]I got to heal this guy.
[02:38.80]Oh, I got you.
[02:40.62]Oh, watch out Spy, turn around.
[02:41.98]Got him.
[02:46.88]Oh man.
[02:48.28]Another Sentry in here somewhere.
[02:49.78]Oh god.
[02:51.94]Don't know from where.
[02:52.62]Damn, all up top.
[02:56.21]Two Sentries up top.
[03:01.27]Is that Medic still, are you guys still alive?
[03:03.71]We both died.
[03:05.82]I got a couple soldiers in here.
[03:08.08]Should be all good.
[03:10.30]Yeah, I'm going to go second floor.
[03:11.70]Take up the sentries.
[03:12.80]Oh, boy.
[03:13.66]Is it heavy in here?
[03:14.30]Oh, God.
[03:15.02]Gabe Newell.
[03:16.30]I didn't know he played with fans of the game.
[03:21.63]You'd think his fingers would be too fat to use the keyboard.
[03:24.13]He's kind of a big boy.
[03:26.47]He is.
[03:28.27]He's a very nice guy, though, apparently.
[03:32.62]That's good.
[03:36.04]When's episode three ever coming out?
[03:39.06]Yeah, I know.
[03:39.94]Did you hear about those protesters that were sitting on the front lawn of the Valve headquarters?
[03:46.14]Apparently there was protesters sitting on the front lawn of Valve maybe like a week or two ago.
[03:51.64]saying like where's episode three there was only like three or four of them so Gabe Newell went out there and ordered him a pizza so they could like eat and hang out there yeah and eventually I guess somebody called the police and the police officer was a huge Team Fortress 2 fan so he like joined in on the protest nice where is their headquarters located uh I think it's in Seattle
[04:16.64]We would just want to sit in the rain all day.
[04:18.56]Oh, stereotyping a city.
[04:22.42]Oh, damn.
[04:25.78]This guy's got a crits.
[04:27.48]You're going to get double crits.
[04:29.03]Oh, man.
[04:29.71]Oh, give it to me, medic.
[04:32.23]Oh, me and this medic.
[04:33.21]Oh, God.
[04:35.65]Got one kill.
[04:36.31]Double pocket.
[04:37.21]I don't think I've ever had the double crits pocket.
[04:40.17]Oh, man.
[04:40.74]That would have been pretty ridiculous.
[04:42.92]Damn engineers with their sentries.
[04:46.06]turtling up.
[04:49.40]Alright.
[04:49.86]I'm one to talk.
[04:50.84]Engineer's like my favorite class.
[04:52.90]Yeah.
[04:53.36]I love my combat energy.
[04:54.32]That's probably my second favorite class.
[04:56.48]Oh, yeah.
[04:57.34]It's just fun.
[04:57.98]Like, it just... I don't know.
[04:59.96]I don't know what's about it.
[05:01.58]It's very satisfying, I will say that.
[05:03.10]It is.
[05:03.50]Absolutely.
[05:04.94]To work with a non-living object to complete an objective of getting those wins.
[05:14.18]Alright, I got like 50%, where you at?
[05:16.21]Second floor, still working on DJ's setup, Mr. Battlefield Legend, playing some Team Fortress.
[05:24.01]Yeah, I'm still on the second to last point, just healing people up, overhealing people.
[05:27.81]Yeah, I'm with Fox, we're good.
[05:38.07]Balls!
[05:38.77]Can't take out that Sentry, it's so close, 36 health.
[05:42.14]You want me to change to Uber?
[05:44.81]probably for this last point that would make sense I got one more crits fully charged if you want it no you can just give it to someone let's go cut down me and cut down are going to rip through people he's going to cut down some people oh I think he's a spy oh god oh you gotta be kidding me uber'd yourself a nice little spy there I just crits uber'd a spy I didn't die though that's the good part about this whole thing
[06:12.69]I'm just going suicide medic right now.
[06:14.15]I'll see if I can kill someone.
[06:15.01]You're just giving him a little, you know, giving him a chance.
[06:22.35]I got regular uber.
[06:24.53]We should be able to take this out.
[06:26.24]Bomb bone.
[06:28.24]No, I'm still, we're still alive somehow.
[06:38.19]Oh, they got a heavy medic over on the, near the second point.
[06:41.55]Second to last point.
[06:42.27]I got one of two sentries down.
[06:44.73]Oh, I'm crapping that.
[06:46.27]Vagabond Dildo with two Ls.
[06:50.51]Laying out.
[06:51.12]Oh, no, no, no.
[06:52.10]Get me out of there.
[06:52.68]Get me out of there.
[06:53.22]Nice.
[06:54.26]I just got pretty much a full uber by killing a medic with the Ubersaw.
[06:59.92]Do you always go Ubersaw?
[07:03.08]Nine times out of ten.
[07:04.00]Just because there's so many opportunities to just hit somebody and get 25 free percent uber.
[07:10.29]If I'm not using the Ubersaw, then I'm using the... What is it called?
[07:14.01]The one where you taunt... What's it called?
[07:15.63]I can't even think of it.
[07:18.30]Amputator.
[07:18.70]The Amputator, yeah.
[07:19.56]There it is.
[07:22.76]Alright, I got an Uber.
[07:23.58]Alright, I'm back to the last point.
[07:27.50]Yeah, I'm standing on the second to last point right now.
[07:29.31]Alright, right behind you.
[07:36.52]Alright, let's see if we can do this.
[07:37.86]Do you have any suggestion which way we should go?
[07:41.32]Where's the sentry?
[07:42.02]Up top?
[07:42.80]Yeah.
[07:45.28]I actually don't really know a fast lane that much.
[07:48.03]Oh, God, I just lost you.
[07:49.75]I'm sorry.
[07:53.11]Alright, let's... Oh, the kind sir that I'm doing.
[07:56.89]Alright, looks like they got another sentry on point.
[08:00.75]Let's try to take that out at range.
[08:02.46]Alright.
[08:03.35]And I think this guy's got a crit streak as well, so.
[08:05.53]Oh, don't get killed.
[08:06.35]Oh, boy.
[08:07.11]I'm alright.
[08:07.47]I'm good.
[08:12.55]Crap.
[08:13.59]Oh, God.
[08:14.17]I got to back up.
[08:16.29]Back burner.
[08:17.59]Yeah, that pyro just kind of ran in.
[08:19.67]Me and X-Pac might get this, though.
[08:25.19]Oh, bam.
[08:26.41]Oh, they're in bad water right now.
[08:31.81]Hot water.
[08:33.19]Oh, God, never mind.
[08:35.39]You know what?
[08:35.71]That sentry's in a spot where we have to get pretty close.
[08:40.18]It's right in the corner.
[08:42.98]Yeah, we're doing work.
[08:44.14]Me and Xpac are doing work.
[08:47.84]Two sentries up here.
[08:49.46]Jesus.
[08:52.32]You know, maybe you should switch to demo.
[08:54.23]I have a point.
[08:55.91]Hold on.
[08:56.13]I almost got these.
[09:03.48]Alright.
[09:04.00]These are two.
[09:04.66]Both down up here.
[09:06.06]Another one below.
[09:07.28]Come on, son.
[09:08.72]Really?
[09:09.08]Oh, you know what?
[09:12.50]I'm going to switch demo.
[09:14.36]We've got three medics right now.
[09:15.96]Oh, son.
[09:18.44]It's down.
[09:18.72]It's down.
[09:19.84]It's down?
[09:20.36]Nice.
[09:21.22]One point.
[09:22.52]Oh, here we go.
[09:23.26]Oh, another one in the corner.
[09:25.16]Come on.
[09:27.48]You're kidding me.
[09:28.30]Alright.
[09:29.87]Push.
[09:31.23]Let's go.
[09:31.43]Let's go.
[09:31.63]Let's go.
[09:37.41]We almost have it.
[09:38.67]Looks like Mr. Pan's slicer doing work.
[09:41.17]Go, go, go.
[09:45.57]Go, go.
[09:45.97]Come on, Shibs.
[09:49.09]Oh, Gabe's doing work.
[09:51.31]We got this.
[09:51.79]We got this.
[09:53.45]Where's that sentry?
[09:56.69]Oh, he's trying to move it up top.
[09:57.75]He's trying to move it up here.
[09:59.81]Oh, no.
[10:00.13]He's not going to get it.
[10:01.03]There's so many guys.
[10:04.07]Oh, wow.
[10:05.15]This is an absolute battle.
[10:09.51]Oh, teleporter and sentry's down.
[10:14.57]Teleporter was there.
[10:15.35]That's weird.
[10:17.41]We just got to get a mass push and get on there.
[10:22.30]Let's see what we got here.
[10:29.84]Oh, this soldier is in this top room.
[10:41.82]Got him.
[10:43.02]Nice.
[10:45.75]So what do they have?
[10:46.65]Four centuries?
[10:48.27]I got something.
[10:51.21]I'm up there too.
[10:52.31]Trying to spam it down wherever it is.
[10:53.75]Trying to look and see.
[10:57.03]Looks like it's in the right corner.
[10:58.04]Oh yeah, I see it.
[11:02.06]Oh, this engineer's not even there.
[11:04.28]Oh, son.
[11:04.68]Looks like the game crashed.
[11:08.22]Oh, you got a game crash?
[11:09.74]Yeah.
[11:10.68]I'll protect you.
[11:15.13]Coming back.
[11:15.79]It's alright.
[11:18.85]We're still up here.
[11:24.12]Oh, keep the heels up.
[11:25.30]Oh no, Fox McCloud.
[11:26.58]Fox McCloud with AFK in the middle.
[11:28.74]Oh, get out of here, Medic.
[11:37.54]This guy's just kind of standing here, too.
[11:40.45]I'm on the point.
[11:41.03]We're going to win.
[11:42.01]Let's get it.
[11:42.43]Let's get it.
[11:43.03]We got it.
[11:43.83]Game over.
[11:44.09]Nice.
[11:47.52]I think multiple... Yeah, a lot of people just crashed.
[11:52.19]I'm looking at the... Everyone just kind of started freezing and standing still.
[11:56.85]So that's what happened.
[11:57.61]Everyone crashed.
