[00:02.26]Oh, my mic is on.
[00:04.70]Hey, you forgot to mute it.
[00:06.54]How are you guys doing?
[00:11.07]Just sitting here quiet.
[00:13.81]How are you?
[00:15.57]How are you?
[00:19.03]Hey, guys.
[00:19.97]Welcome to another stream.
[00:22.98]Hornets have not killed me yet, and I'm still here.
[00:26.42]There were four in total from last night.
[00:31.02]And...
[00:32.72]There's a possibility for a repeat.
[00:35.08]There's been no more since.
[00:38.74]But obviously the concern is still there.
[00:41.11]What time did they end up showing up last night?
[00:43.29]Was it like 9.30?
[00:45.09]9?
[00:47.35]Because that's probably when it'll happen again if it'll happen again.
[00:53.02]You know.
[00:59.13]I like my medium rare.
[01:00.90]What do you like?
[01:01.84]Medium rare?
[01:03.96]You like eating hornets medium rare.
[01:09.26]What the heck is this guy on about?
[01:10.61]Just give him a smooch.
[01:17.08]But today, me and Etalyx are going to play Overcooked 2.
[01:22.17]It's a game where you... It's a chef game.
[01:23.95]You cook lettuce and you serve it to people.
[01:27.67]And you get points and you try to get three stars.
[01:32.72]So this should be fun.
[01:35.90]We have both been looking forward to this ever since the co-op stream where he was here in person.
[01:41.56]We played a little bit of it.
[01:43.82]Probably a lot more to do in this one.
[01:45.11]It should be fun.
[01:46.66]So, also, I want to talk about the emotes, because I know I'm like, oh, you know, you'll get the emotes tomorrow.
[01:51.64]You're going to get the emotes tomorrow.
[01:52.62]Hey, you know, the emotes will be there tomorrow.
[01:56.48]There's just been a bunch of extenuating circumstances where I haven't been able to stay in this room for more than, like, an hour at a time.
[02:04.02]So, you will get them.
[02:06.24]They will happen.
[02:07.51]I'm just behind on it because of all these stupid...
[02:11.21]excuse excuses right now the streamer is talking about a bunch of excuses and I know you've already tuned it out so we've got an excuse lined up here and from there we're going to end the excuse and you'll see them probably on Sunday that's the excuse so uh give me a minute while I get my coffee we'll introduce Etalyx to the uh to the world you know you never heard them before and uh see you in a minute
[02:44.14]Translation, they're never coming.
[02:45.74]What if I just never put them on?
[02:49.93]That would be so dumb.
[02:51.67]What a waste of time that would be.
[02:53.01]Alright, BRB.
[03:20.32]$400 on SurveyMonkey for a poll.
[03:25.18]That would be such a huge net loss.
[03:28.50]Just think about it.
[03:29.04]10 people won.
[03:32.82]Each one of those people got $50.
[03:34.81]Well, they haven't got it yet.
[03:35.71]I haven't paid them yet.
[03:37.45]That's another thing.
[03:38.13]Gotta make sure I give everybody the money that they solely deserve.
[03:41.49]So you're talking about $500 plus $400.
[03:42.55]That's another $900 joke if I didn't put the emotes in.
[03:49.04]That's not a good idea.
[03:52.94]So don't worry, you will see them.
[03:58.03]I was thinking, I want to get my money back from SurveyMonkey.
[04:02.17]People could manipulate that vote.
[04:04.03]What the fuck, it's $400?
[04:07.19]I was trying to be so sure about it.
[04:11.16]I want my goddamn money back.
[04:15.82]Alright, let's see how he's doing.
[04:17.10]Is he here?
[04:18.96]I don't think he's here.
[04:20.22]I still see the muted and deafened symbol on him.
[04:22.74]That means he's still talking to his friends.
[04:28.48]I could have made it for you.
[04:29.52]But yeah, the whole purpose of trying to do Survey Monkey was to make it so it was a full, legitimate service.
[04:37.35]And people could still fuck with it.
[04:41.91]Goddamn manipulation.
[04:43.41]Hey!
[04:43.93]You know, just talking about...
[04:50.33]I'm going to manipulate you.
[04:52.00]Are you ready?
[04:55.70]I'm fucking sticking my hands out and I'm swiggling my fingers around.
[04:58.98]You understand?
[04:59.50]I'm manipulating you right now.
[05:04.70]You know what I'm saying?
[05:05.82]I'm putting my hands out there.
[05:07.00]Are we ready to do this?
[05:18.35]So we're the old couple in this, apparently.
[05:24.35]Oh, by the way, nobody could hear a fucking word you were saying.
[05:27.43]I was just saying that to nobody.
[05:31.07]Wow.
[05:32.13]You guys thought I was saying that to you.
[05:33.31]It's too early for parentheses ignore tasks.
[05:35.15]You can't do that at the beginning of the stream.
[05:36.62]You got to save that for at least two and a half hours in.
[05:39.34]So everybody here just thought I was saying I was going to manipulate the whole, I'm going to manipulate my chat and my viewers.
[05:46.02]Oh, so just a regular stream then.
[05:49.40]Easy.
[05:53.50]Are you ready to start?
[05:54.06]What are you doing?
[05:55.26]I am.
[05:56.24]I'm here.
[05:56.70]I'm just making sure that everything is ready on your side from a technical perspective.
[05:59.70]Just wait until that knife goes over and I swing it back too far.
[06:04.84]Listen, I've got a ceramic knife and I've got a... You've got pizza dough.
[06:10.59]I have a pan.
[06:12.65]I'm going to hit you in the face with that frying pan.
[06:17.41]And you're just going to slither down into the bathtub and drown.
[06:20.11]Oh, what you meant to say was insta-blocked.
[06:23.73]On every social media, by the way.
[06:26.05]Not just in the real world when I block the plate.
[06:31.51]So can we, we can do the campaign, right?
[06:34.33]Yes, we can do the co-op campaign.
[06:35.97]One second, and I will be able to start that.
[06:38.99]How you doing?
[06:39.35]How's your, how's your CPU doing?
[06:41.99]You good?
[06:43.59]Oh, we're at a toasty 86% right now, and the game hasn't even begun.
[06:49.17]Your computer's going to catch fire.
[06:52.21]New game.
[06:55.23]And we're in.
[06:55.89]Get that mouse off the screen before everyone has a meltdown.
[06:58.17]Alright, so we have to ask the question about playing Overcooked 2 today.
[07:07.01]You may be aware that there was a star-based...
[07:10.19]achievement system present on every single level.
[07:13.06]Yeah, it's one out of three, right?
[07:14.96]Right.
[07:15.34]So the question then becomes, uh, what is the minimum... Two.
[07:21.08]...that we are able to gather before moving on to the next level?
[07:25.18]Yeah, two.
[07:27.10]One is too little, three is way too much overachieving, two is just good enough.
[07:33.54]The Goldilocks number.
[07:34.44]Yeah.
[07:34.72]Number one is too soft, three is too hard.
[07:37.98]Alright, everyone pay attention to the lore.
[07:40.42]Yeah, listen to what the coconut's telling you.
[07:41.80]I'm gonna stick a straw in this guy and drink him.
[07:46.74]Hey, it's not just a coconut.
[07:48.12]It is a cute little dog.
[07:52.61]And two old Tsutsu farmers.
[07:54.93]The dog is just barking.
[07:56.93]He's along for the ride.
[07:59.25]Is that our dog?
[08:00.71]He's teaching us how to cook.
[08:01.97]These are the ancient arts, forgotten, passed down for generations.
[08:05.09]Yeah, but they already taught us this in the last game.
[08:09.12]Are you turning the pages?
[08:11.44]Well, I'm turning the dialogue.
[08:13.71]Oh, I thought you were using your hand.
[08:18.55]Okay, I can't pretend to be that stupid.
[08:20.45]You know what I mean?
[08:20.99]Like, that's just clearly... Clearly, that's beyond.
[08:23.96]What were you going to say?
[08:29.32]By the way, what?
[08:33.76]He's pretending.
[08:35.64]What, you thought I actually thought he was reaching his hand into the screen and turning the page of the book?
[08:40.02]That's too obvious.
[08:41.02]I gotta dial it back a little.
[08:47.61]Get manipulated.
[08:49.15]My fingers are out there.
[08:51.11]Oh, so you're telling me I was muted for that awesome joke that I did at the beginning of the stream?
[08:54.73]Yeah, what, did you make a muted joke?
[08:57.35]Well, you muted me.
[08:59.13]What?
[09:00.01]Because when your chat thought you were manipulating them, I was like, oh, so it's just another normal stream, and everyone was like, L-U-L, and really, they didn't hear it the whole time.
[09:13.07]Oh, I'm sorry, dude.
[09:14.77]You must have been muted.
[09:15.97]Alright, so we pick up the, yep, over here, and then what is it, X?
[09:20.78]Alright, so what are we making, salad?
[09:24.54]We're making salad.
[09:25.44]Alright, so I'm the chopper, you're the plater.
[09:28.82]That's a terrible salad, by the way.
[09:31.90]I don't know.
[09:32.94]Don't you eat raw kale?
[09:33.76]What are you doing?
[09:34.65]Get it out.
[09:35.35]Serve it.
[09:37.85]We're not even on the clock yet.
[09:38.95]This is just our training.
[09:41.45]Okay.
[09:42.15]So now the salad's a little bit more complex.
[09:46.54]But don't you eat plain kale?
[09:49.38]Yeah.
[09:52.34]Okay.
[09:53.80]How's that different from someone who just eats a lettuce salad?
[09:56.96]Because lettuce is just water.
[09:59.22]Why are you giving this to me?
[10:02.40]I just put the plate down so you would have an easy access point to drop off those tomatoes.
[10:06.28]Kale has goddamn nutrients.
[10:07.92]Lettuce is water and fucking fiber.
[10:12.25]It's nothing.
[10:13.69]There's no nutrients in lettuce.
[10:18.49]It's better than the alternative, you know?
[10:21.93]You could be eating, like, potato chips or something instead.
[10:26.82]I'm going to place these here for you.
[10:28.98]That's a lie?
[10:30.06]What's the nutritional value of lettuce?
[10:33.24]Look, lettuce is a vegetable, and you will respect it.
[10:35.86]No, look it up.
[10:36.44]I want someone to look it up.
[10:37.84]Can you look it up?
[10:38.70]No, you're busy.
[10:39.46]You're streaming.
[10:41.14]Hey, somebody look that up.
[10:42.84]The person that I'm playing with, check that out on Wikipedia for me.
[10:47.12]Please verify the integrity of my statements.
[10:52.66]Respect the lettuce.
[10:56.48]Ooh, we're on fire right now.
[10:57.60]We've got, like, 56.5 calories.
[10:58.52]It's five calories and no nutrients.
[11:04.36]Well, you're not hurting yourself either by eating lettuce.
[11:07.42]No.
[11:07.90]It's like celery, though.
[11:08.88]I mean, if you're eating a salad comprised only of lettuce, you're almost fasting.
[11:13.52]You're just eating something just to chew on it.
[11:15.34]What am I doing?
[11:17.18]What?
[11:17.88]Get this off the screen.
[11:19.04]It's like you can emote and cover your screen.
[11:21.56]Hold on.
[11:21.84]How do you do that?
[11:24.73]Yeah, other, like, okay, you gotta say, you gotta be more clear.
[11:28.92]Romaine lettuce is not just lettuce.
[11:32.18]That's a different type.
[11:33.38]Oh, crap, we have a timer.
[11:36.72]We're gonna get one more turn in.
[11:38.50]Maybe two.
[11:39.20]What do we need?
[11:39.73]Just lettuce.
[11:40.41]Just lettuce.
[11:41.13]Only lettuce.
[11:41.63]Quick, quick, give me that zero nutritional value bullshit.
[11:46.07]Lettuce, like spinach, for instance, right?
[11:47.13]It's just a way to fast.
[11:47.89]You should be eating spinach, not lettuce.
[11:49.33]Bring that tomato.
[11:50.33]If you put spinach on your, oh, shit, hold on.
[11:54.49]Eight seconds.
[11:55.03]Give me that tomato.
[11:57.65]There we go.
[11:58.05]There we go.
[11:58.79]You need any of these?
[11:59.65]$268.
[11:59.73]That's all we got time for.
[12:00.81]Wait, so why do you guys spin the weirdest fucking things?
[12:07.29]What is going on?
[12:09.97]Did we do something weird already?
[12:11.13]I don't know.
[12:11.55]I don't know.
[12:12.63]I think we're arguing about lettuce.
[12:15.37]Oh.
[12:18.32]Say heat breeze.
[12:20.54]Bark, bark.
[12:22.47]In the game, too.
[12:23.65]On cue and in real life.
[12:26.95]I didn't know Midas was one of the cast.
[12:32.93]We're going to really pay attention.
[12:34.17]He's got more voiceover roles than I have.
[12:38.74]Did I say there was a punch button?
[12:41.50]There is a... Is there a punch button?
[12:43.24]There's a dash button.
[12:45.36]There's a punch friend button in mouth.
[12:50.29]Alright.
[12:50.55]The unbred are spreading throughout the Onion Kingdom.
[12:53.29]Another zombie apocalypse survival game.
[12:55.23]Am I right?
[12:55.63]Alright.
[12:56.39]Can you just give me the whole thing?
[12:58.41]When the whole thing's over, just give me the TL;DR of the whole game because I just want to cook food.
[13:02.90]I did.
[13:03.60]I just did.
[13:04.40]There's moldy bread rising up throughout the kingdom.
[13:08.02]That's the whole story.
[13:08.78]It's a zombie survival game.
[13:12.47]Where's your Gordon Ramsay voice?
[13:13.87]I'm playing as an old lady.
[13:16.45]You should be angry that I'm not going like this.
[13:21.43]Oh, I'm sorry.
[13:22.45]Alright, so we talk to Coconut?
[13:28.35]He may be be- Oh no, I think we just leave.
[13:32.00]Yeah, you just got him to say the same thing again.
[13:34.96]The dog's name is Kevin.
[13:37.78]What a shit dog name.
[13:39.98]Maybe he was a person before and he got turned into a dog.
[13:43.92]Kevin.
[13:44.16]What do you think about humans named Kevin?
[13:46.20]That's fine.
[13:48.06]You got to have your dog name something just strange enough where it can't be confused as a human.
[13:53.78]Because if you call your dog, right?
[13:56.06]Let's say you're on the phone with your insurance company.
[13:57.98]Yeah, but you could go like, hey, Kev, come here.
[13:59.98]No, but that's what I mean.
[14:00.64]But like, if you're on the phone with your insurance company, you're making a claim, like you got an offender vendor or something, and the insurance policy is like, okay, yes, sir, please give us what happened.
[14:08.59]And you're like, yeah, yeah, okay.
[14:10.31]Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, get off me.
[14:12.43]Kevin, get off my leg, you little shit.
[14:14.03]You know what I mean?
[14:14.73]And you go back to talking.
[14:16.73]Oh, like, Kevin, food's ready.
[14:18.37]Like, yo, that's good, Kevin.
[14:19.44]Eat it off the ground.
[14:20.22]Good boy.
[14:21.36]The insurance person's going to be like, what the fuck is going on over there?
[14:26.18]I feel like that's best case scenario, though.
[14:28.64]Is it?
[14:30.58]I don't know.
[14:31.00]If I was the... If you were the person working in the office that's taking that call, wouldn't that be one of the highlights of your day, probably?
[14:39.38]Instead of, like, boring your version of... Like, you old lady.
[14:43.89]Huh?
[14:44.91]What?
[14:46.07]What'd you say?
[14:47.01]Say it again, please.
[14:48.57]How much money do I lose?
[14:50.73]I'm getting a lot of shit for my dog being named Otto right now.
[14:53.35]Yeah, I understand the... I understand the issue.
[14:56.93]We have to, like, make fish.
[15:00.42]Yeah, but Otto is not Kevin.
[15:01.95]You know what I mean?
[15:03.25]Otto.
[15:03.89]It's a person's name, but it's not Kevin.
[15:07.05]That's like naming your dog Michael.
[15:09.27]Or like Greg.
[15:11.71]It's too easy.
[15:12.57]Like, hey, come here, Greg.
[15:13.93]What about Air Bud?
[15:16.72]But that's like a different enough name.
[15:18.16]It's not like... Naming your dog Chris.
[15:20.00]Is Buddy a different enough name?
[15:22.68]It is.
[15:24.04]It's not like naming your dog John.
[15:25.68]Or Chris.
[15:27.64]Or Kevin.
[15:28.72]That's different.
[15:30.52]What about Greg?
[15:31.90]Greg, that's too much of a person.
[15:33.33]Alright, but what about names that used to be popular that aren't popular anymore?
[15:36.43]Where do we draw the line here?
[15:37.53]The trend is out.
[15:38.21]That's fine.
[15:45.38]Should everyone ask you what the dog's name should be before they name it?
[15:48.66]Yeah, alright, so you're on the phone with the insurance company again.
[15:52.14]And, oh, what's that?
[15:53.20]Yeah, yeah, your claim is being processed.
[15:55.54]And the guy's like, oh, hey, hold on a second, hold on a second, ma'am, hold on.
[15:58.72]Kevin, did you shit on the floor again?
[16:01.75]Oh, goddammit, I gotta clean your shit up off the floor?
[16:05.77]That's another scenario where that's gonna be weird.
[16:08.75]I feel like that conversation has probably already happened, though, and it didn't involve dogs.
[16:13.03]It probably just involved an incommnant, Kevin.
[16:15.43]I'm just, like, picking up plates.
[16:17.94]Just don't name them human names.
[16:19.58]That's the whole argument that we're making here.
[16:22.18]But if humans make the name, what name's not a human name?
[16:25.94]Okay, now you're trying to play, like, the thinking face game.
[16:28.18]Now I'm trying to play the metaphysical.
[16:31.29]I guess I've paid attention.
[16:33.25]Moving the goalposts.
[16:34.95]I got two fishes coming up here.
[16:38.18]Okay.
[16:38.72]On the side.
[16:39.04]Why are we not washing plates?
[16:40.98]That's why they hired you.
[16:43.05]We don't have to wash plates yet.
[16:44.27]We're not that advanced.
[16:45.17]25 seconds.
[16:45.89]Alright, what do we need?
[16:50.33]We hire people to do that for us.
[16:51.91]Alright, come on.
[16:52.53]We need two more fishes here.
[16:55.18]We can get it.
[16:59.90]What's wrong with saying my dog shit on the floor?
[17:01.96]Yeah, no, nothing's wrong with... I mean, that's kind of weird.
[17:04.78]But it's the fact that it's a... Like, it could be a person that you're talking about.
[17:09.66]Alright, we need... We got three stars.
[17:16.44]We're fine.
[17:18.26]We more than doubled the mandatory score for this.
[17:20.90]300 was the requirement.
[17:24.30]Look, I can emote now.
[17:25.52]Hold on.
[17:25.82]Can you?
[17:26.36]Yeah.
[17:26.92]Okay, well played.
[17:29.47]You can't pick the same one I picked, though.
[17:31.07]It looks like a dummy.
[17:32.85]And stop picking the same one I picked.
[17:34.64]I'm not.
[17:35.16]I can't even see it.
[17:38.60]Your dog is named Milo.
[17:40.56]Is that bad?
[17:41.24]No, that's fine.
[17:44.19]Look, you guys think that I'm making a big stink.
[17:45.93]There are people named Milo, though.
[17:46.89]Well, let me ask you a challenge.
[17:49.91]Do you know any dogs that are named Jeremy?
[17:53.03]Jeremy.
[17:56.39]Ever in your life.
[17:57.91]Anybody in this chat have a dog named Jeremy?
[18:02.08]Or... Chris?
[18:06.90]Oh, yeah, I do.
[18:07.90]Yeah, fucking Jesus.
[18:10.77]I do.
[18:11.61]That's my dog.
[18:18.48]I do.
[18:19.30]I'm renaming Midas tonight.
[18:21.02]You know what they need to implement?
[18:22.86]The whole internet anonymity thing.
[18:25.75]You should have to give your name, your full name, your social security number, and if you tell a lie, if you don't tell them the truth, then it deducts a dollar from your bank account.
[18:34.29]We'll see how the world changes then.
[18:37.12]Wow.
[18:39.50]You say a swear word?
[18:41.16]You say something mean to somebody?
[18:42.30]$10 deducted from your bank account.
[18:45.66]Wait, I don't need this.
[18:48.53]I would lose all my money.
[18:49.69]If you say something mean.
[18:51.42]You can't say something mean.
[18:52.98]I don't think we need to chop these.
[18:54.52]They just go in the stew.
[18:55.78]Okay.
[18:57.98]This is where things start getting serious.
[18:59.82]You chopped this shit up.
[19:01.84]Hold on.
[19:03.15]Why can't I pause the game for you?
[19:04.53]Get these fucking people out of here.
[19:05.93]How do I punch?
[19:09.63]I don't think there's a punch.
[19:10.53]There is a push.
[19:11.41]We need to restart this level.
[19:12.47]We're going to restart it.
[19:13.17]Hold on.
[19:17.73]Rich people would just get to say whatever they want.
[19:19.49]That's like such a fucked up society.
[19:27.55]Oh no, my bank account.
[19:33.30]They already do.
[19:34.00]Well, welcome to the society.
[19:37.02]Did we lose Talos?
[19:43.66]Alright, I'm gonna start the rise.
[19:45.98]Okay.
[19:46.82]I'm doing it.
[19:47.18]We need two rice.
[19:47.98]We're here.
[19:50.04]So I got two rice boiling.
[19:51.94]You work on the... You take the green apple fruit roll-up.
[19:54.94]We have to chop the fish, right?
[19:56.29]Yeah.
[19:56.65]And then you roll it up in the green apple fruit roll-up after I give you the rice.
[19:59.23]So here's rice one.
[20:00.87]On.
[20:03.07]Rice two.
[20:03.51]Done.
[20:03.89]So it's this plus that.
[20:06.14]And then you wrap it up.
[20:07.14]It's sushi.
[20:07.48]Sushi.
[20:08.82]Yeah.
[20:09.72]I know what it is.
[20:11.62]In the context of the video game, I'm just making sure that I'm doing it in an order if there needs to be one.
[20:17.58]Well, you need to hurry up because we got an order coming here.
[20:20.21]Why don't you put rice in all three?
[20:21.71]Because they'll burn.
[20:22.45]I need plates.
[20:23.29]Well, then take them off the top.
[20:25.13]But that's not fun.
[20:26.07]What do you mean fun?
[20:29.13]Here's a little plate with rice on it.
[20:31.93]Whatever.
[20:32.21]You'll figure it out.
[20:33.97]I got it.
[20:35.03]Rice on.
[20:35.35]I nailed it, actually.
[20:37.49]Look, I'm chopping fish over here, okay?
[20:38.81]There you go.
[20:41.57]You good?
[20:42.11]We got two more orders coming up.
[20:45.57]Oh, we're good, alright.
[20:46.37]We're getting four dollars.
[20:48.83]Why do I feel like... I feel like this old guy over here is going to steal something.
[20:55.39]I can't, like, move him out of the way.
[20:57.51]You know what you could do?
[20:58.31]You could go get the plates for me when you're waiting in your downtime and then lay them out for me.
[21:02.35]Hey, look what is right here.
[21:03.65]What do you think is going on right here?
[21:05.67]I already got two waiting for you.
[21:15.13]Oh, fuck.
[21:15.97]Oh, fuck.
[21:16.48]Oh, fuck.
[21:16.98]Oh, fuck.
[21:17.48]Oh, fuck.
[21:17.90]Okay.
[21:18.54]Oh, fuck.
[21:18.96]You're good.
[21:19.76]Just calm down.
[21:20.46]It's good.
[21:23.34]Okay, I'm going to get some plates.
[21:24.82]Where are the plates?
[21:26.04]There's, like, no more.
[21:27.96]They come out after the people finish eating on them, okay?
[21:31.34]So we give them the food, then the plate reappears.
[21:33.60]Okay, I'm good.
[21:35.62]Should I chop this for you?
[21:37.34]Yeah, you're good.
[21:39.86]I've got three things laid out for you to dump rice into.
[21:44.72]Okay, got one.
[21:46.28]Where's the third one?
[21:47.82]Well, here's the plate.
[21:49.83]I already got that one.
[21:52.19]There.
[21:53.27]Oh, fuck.
[21:54.69]Whatever.
[21:56.03]Sorry, we got 43.
[21:57.11]We got 42 minutes to do this, so we're fine.
[22:00.43]43 minutes.
[22:01.55]Oh, this one needs it.
[22:02.85]We're going to be doing this level for the entire stream.
[22:07.09]Minus $10.
[22:07.53]No, we're not going to start this shit.
[22:11.49]I forgot.
[22:12.11]Give like Twitch cat.
[22:14.23]Give the cat on Twitch.
[22:16.83]You know what I'm trying to say.
[22:18.43]Just take this one.
[22:20.17]Oh, you messed it up.
[22:21.29]I'm trying to say something.
[22:22.69]I can't do this and talk about Twitch cat.
[22:29.40]Alright, we're good.
[22:30.32]We're going to get three stars here, man.
[22:31.64]Don't worry.
[22:32.44]This is only the second level.
[22:35.24]There's probably like 40 levels in this game.
[22:37.24]This is the second one.
[22:38.52]Yeah, we're fine.
[22:39.20]We're way over our budget there.
[22:41.97]We away over a budget.
[22:46.26]Under budget.
[22:46.68]Yeah, see?
[22:46.96]All 420.
[22:47.30]993.
[22:47.36]We could just sit there after halfway of doing that.
[22:51.04]You could, but then we wouldn't set the high score for the leaderboards.
[22:53.84]That's true.
[22:55.66]But what I was saying is, anything involving numbers or going up or down in a linear counting scale, I can't say.
[23:08.36]Everyone will start counting.
[23:13.03]I think it may be too late.
[23:14.03]I mean, I'm not there, but you did just say counting on the stream, so I fear it doesn't matter at this point what you do.
[23:22.61]Alright, just put it in emote-only mode for five years.
[23:26.19]See if they figure it out.
[23:31.45]I may or may not be part of that problem.
[23:33.57]Anyway, dirty plates need to be washed up in the sink.
[23:36.92]You got it.
[23:37.82]Alright.
[23:39.32]You got it.
[23:39.82]Alright, give me one sec.
[23:45.31]Oh, this is complicated now.
[23:46.55]Alright, hold on.
[23:47.67]Alright.
[23:50.39]So we got the same deal here.
[23:53.56]So I'll be the designated dishwasher, okay?
[23:56.40]Where's the rice?
[23:59.86]Oh, it's over there.
[24:01.02]Gotta go all the way over here for rice.
[24:06.54]Okay.
[24:07.32]So, we're gonna have to do a thing where one of us stays on one side and one of us stays on the other side.
[24:15.07]So, we need cucumbers.
[24:17.69]I got rice coming up here.
[24:19.85]You got rice.
[24:20.47]You're going to have to pass me the rice.
[24:22.58]I have the turn in.
[24:25.92]I pass you the cucumbers.
[24:26.98]I thought you just put a mine over here.
[24:30.02]I was like, why is there a claymore mine over here?
[24:33.87]the better to blow you up with.
[24:35.01]Okay, I'll do the dishes.
[24:36.09]Yeah, you have to do all the dishes.
[24:39.57]Serving.
[24:41.71]Just serving a dish into this.
[24:43.37]Did you just wave to the camera?
[24:44.69]I think I may have.
[24:45.33]Alright, here's another one.
[24:45.99]Alright, so can you pass me just three rices?
[24:50.72]Mm-hmm.
[24:51.62]Three rices?
[24:52.24]Do you know the plural of rice?
[24:55.02]I'm sure it's rice, but we don't have time for semantics.
[25:00.94]Oh, there's always time.
[25:02.65]Alright, the next one is just three lobster tails.
[25:08.24]Without anything else.
[25:09.70]Just without anything on them.
[25:10.56]Just lobster tails.
[25:14.98]Oh, dick.
[25:16.76]Oh, dick.
[25:17.81]Etalyx, I need something here.
[25:19.49]Help me!
[25:20.39]Help me!
[25:20.75]Help me!
[25:21.43]Help me!
[25:22.05]Help me!
[25:22.81]Help me!
[25:23.25]We're good.
[25:26.49]Everything's fine.
[25:27.51]Don't worry.
[25:30.17]Okay.
[25:30.43]Hey, back to normal.
[25:31.91]I have no room over here, though.
[25:34.55]We need some plates that need rice.
[25:36.01]All I need is the lobsters, and I turn these in.
[25:39.61]There's three of them, though, and it's kind of a roundabout ordeal to do.
[25:43.38]Hand me those plates when they're done.
[25:44.44]I got some pots here with rice on it.
[25:46.74]So you can hold those for a while.
[25:48.30]The plates automatically go back to the sink.
[25:50.98]They do, don't they?
[25:52.48]Yes, they do.
[25:54.18]Alright.
[25:54.46]We need another just basic shrimp.
[25:56.34]You can take it out of view mode only mode.
[25:57.62]I feel like it's been five enough years.
[26:01.11]Uh, basic shrimp, and I got two cooked rice.
[26:03.33]You got a clean plate.
[26:04.35]Any clean plate will do.
[26:05.39]Excuse me.
[26:05.79]We're on fire.
[26:10.42]Alright, so back to sushi.
[26:12.10]I'm just doing it again.
[26:13.64]Whatever.
[26:16.52]Oh, God.
[26:18.40]You fucking weirdos.
[26:22.33]Streamer insults chat on stream.
[26:24.71]That's not an insult.
[26:25.45]I'm a weirdo.
[26:26.47]Five minutes.
[26:28.31]So we just need... I would say with the 19 seconds, I would just... I got rice on a plate here.
[26:33.51]Hot rice on a plate.
[26:34.69]Hot rice on a plate.
[26:35.39]Ow.
[26:35.65]Put it on the one.
[26:37.29]There's a plate right there.
[26:38.89]You need a veggie tail, whatever this thing is.
[26:42.55]A pickle.
[26:43.11]What is that?
[26:43.53]A cucumber.
[26:44.25]Veggie tail.
[26:44.83]Cut him.
[26:46.57]Two.
[26:48.11]Oh, you didn't do it.
[26:50.33]It's right there.
[26:51.19]Photo finished.
[26:53.77]Look, I'm going to have to ask for a replay on that one because I think I did it.
[26:57.31]We're fine.
[26:59.14]Please verify.
[27:02.59]Whatever.
[27:02.89]We got the points.
[27:04.67]Yeah, we're good.
[27:13.95]It's on emote only mode again.
[27:15.32]Oh, we got options.
[27:19.38]Hidden levels.
[27:21.98]Secret criteria.
[27:26.55]The secret criteria is you won the level.
[27:29.91]You gotta perform the secret slime action.
[27:31.93]So does that mean we're going to the secret first?
[27:34.79]Yeah.
[27:37.16]Hey, watch out for Link.
[27:38.20]Watch out for Link.
[27:38.78]He's currently shilling around.
[27:44.48]Was this a raft GameCube joke?
[27:46.60]Oh, why'd you take it off?
[27:47.90]I did that for a very particular reason because people couldn't fucking talk shit.
[27:51.90]That was, oh my god.
[27:53.68]You took it off right at the worst possible moment.
[27:59.49]So was that a combination toon link with Woody Woodpecker joke?
[28:04.73]Yeah, no, I was making a terrible shit reference, and it was in emote-only mode, so I thought people couldn't say anything about it.
[28:11.48]But they took emote-only mode off right when I said that.
[28:19.36]That was a Woody Woodpecker laugh, though.
[28:24.37]You can't deny it.
[28:25.09]Chop meat or veg mixed with flour and then stream together.
[28:29.33]We have to stream these?
[28:30.09]Alright, so we have to stream us chopping and then what is it, mincing?
[28:35.19]Oh, boy.
[28:35.67]We're going to mince.
[28:37.41]Hold on.
[28:37.77]Should we go look at that again?
[28:38.86]Alright, hold on.
[28:41.02]This looks complex.
[28:42.58]So we got just one fish.
[28:46.50]So one fish.
[28:48.79]Which then has to be turned into... I have a mixing bowl.
[28:52.21]I have to... No, I have to chop this.
[28:54.95]And then... We should have read the tutorial.
[28:56.73]That's a tenderizer right here.
[28:58.43]Right?
[28:59.67]That's a fire extinguisher that you're trying to access.
[29:02.21]What did I just do with this?
[29:03.49]I just crushed it.
[29:04.88]Put that on a plate.
[29:05.40]I think you made chicken nuggets.
[29:07.04]Okay, put that on a plate.
[29:09.72]You can't.
[29:10.48]Because it's not cooked yet.
[29:11.52]You have to put it in your steamer.
[29:14.02]Oh, I have to steam this?
[29:15.22]I thought you... Yeah, you have to steam it.
[29:17.69]Alright, and then... We're learning.
[29:23.21]We're just trying to figure this out.
[29:24.93]Yeah, this is just a trial run.
[29:26.68]So then when this pops out, it's going to be these weird little nuggets.
[29:30.16]No, give me this.
[29:30.70]Okay.
[29:32.04]Okay.
[29:34.34]So it makes hot dogs.
[29:38.00]I got there first.
[29:39.22]So now, is this what they wanted?
[29:41.45]Yes.
[29:41.83]It is.
[29:42.21]Okay.
[29:42.69]So that little symbol means it has to be minced.
[29:44.13]Now we need flour with this in the steamer.
[29:49.57]No, the flour goes to me.
[29:52.04]Then you take the meat.
[29:53.90]So then just meat goes in.
[29:55.46]And you chop it up.
[29:57.28]Chopped and then smashed.
[29:58.48]Then I take this.
[29:59.68]So that's been crushed.
[30:01.30]And that goes in here.
[30:02.08]I think I need another flour.
[30:03.31]Why did it turn into a fire extinguisher?
[30:06.61]What?
[30:06.81]I don't... Okay, hold on.
[30:09.21]Now it's a patty.
[30:11.81]You just made a cheeseburger.
[30:14.57]So I need the flour?
[30:18.76]I can't put this in here.
[30:20.80]I don't think you need the flour.
[30:22.76]It definitely has the picture of the beef.
[30:27.60]Hold on.
[30:28.22]By the way, this was never anything.
[30:30.34]I thought that was a press.
[30:33.03]No, that's the fire extinguisher.
[30:34.45]That's what I was saying.
[30:35.99]I thought that was a meat squisher.
[30:37.43]I told you it was a fire extinguisher from the beginning.
[30:42.19]So you have to do something with that then.
[30:45.37]No, there's a picture.
[30:46.85]Let's just start over.
[30:47.98]But no, no, no, but what do you have to do with the meat?
[30:50.06]You have to do something to that meat.
[30:51.56]It has a picture of the steamer with the meat.
[30:53.90]But I couldn't put it in here.
[30:56.83]Maybe the flour goes in.
[31:00.09]Give me that meat.
[31:02.97]This is a new mechanic that they've introduced into the world of Overcooked.
[31:06.15]Yeah, I can't put it in here.
[31:07.35]Try to put it in the mixer.
[31:08.85]It's gone.
[31:09.15]I can't even pick it up.
[31:12.15]It's in the back corner.
[31:13.37]How'd you throw it back there?
[31:14.55]I don't know.
[31:14.93]It just fell back there, and I'm too scared to reach to get it.
[31:19.63]Give me another piece of meat.
[31:21.05]I may have broken the mixer.
[31:22.27]I think you have to mix the meat up.
[31:23.17]This is coming out of my paycheck.
[31:25.95]Give me a piece of meat.
[31:27.57]This is an electrified mix match.
[31:32.48]Give me a piece of meat.
[31:37.38]I don't think I do anything with this.
[31:38.90]You put it in the blender.
[31:40.42]Oh, really?
[31:42.32]How bad do you want that piece of meat?
[31:43.96]Put it in the blender.
[31:50.78]Ah, there.
[31:51.44]Okay, there we go.
[31:52.40]See?
[31:53.16]See?
[31:54.02]See?
[31:54.34]Okay, but it probably goes with the flower, though.
[31:58.52]So you have flower on your side.
[32:01.12]So the flower has to be... You have to do this, and then you take it out.
[32:05.38]Ah-ha-ha-ha.
[32:07.01]Ah-ha.
[32:07.81]Two plus one.
[32:08.61]And then I put it in the steamer.
[32:10.83]Yes.
[32:12.87]Let's just make sure this is correct.
[32:14.59]Let's make sure this is correct, then we'll do it the right way next time.
[32:16.89]Yes, it is correct.
[32:18.82]And then this turns into what?
[32:20.41]19 seconds.
[32:22.31]It looks like it turns into tamales.
[32:26.09]Tamales?
[32:26.51]What are those?
[32:27.05]Those are like dumplings.

[32:57.00]I forgot.

[34:04.36]Okay, what the fuck was that?
[34:07.09]What's going on here?
[34:10.61]Did we not do that right somehow?
[34:12.59]I don't think it's supposed to be doubled up.
[34:17.11]What?
[34:17.29]No, you can put two things in here.
[34:21.90]Well... It ain't working.
[34:26.53]We gotta do it one at a time, the old-fashioned.
[34:28.13]Let's dump it.
[34:28.87]No, that's definitely not true.
[34:32.92]I don't understand.
[34:33.50]I just threw it in the garbage can.
[34:36.06]That's what I think of your work so far.
[34:37.80]That's not two separate correct recipes.
[34:39.66]That's one incorrect recipe.
[34:42.34]So the pluses are just... The pluses are for complex four-ingredient recipes.
[34:47.82]I thought it could hold... Okay, I get it.
[34:50.87]Whatever.
[34:51.61]Restart.

[35:04.00]Kind of is.
[35:06.11]Did anything ever happen to that game?
[35:07.31]I think it died.
[35:09.41]Ratburger?
[35:09.95]I mean, it was just kind of a fun little thing for a little while.
[35:12.65]Alright, let's do it.
[35:15.15]Can't figure out child's cooking game.
[35:18.26]Uh, excuse me, this game is not a children's cooking game.
[35:20.82]This is absolutely not a children's game.
[35:22.70]This is the kind of game you give the controller that's disconnected to the child, and they pretend to play.
[35:28.78]Oh, you need some flair.
[35:29.82]Take the flair if you want.
[35:39.03]Alright, we got two done dinners.
[35:41.83]Who is blue and who is red?
[35:43.43]Um... I am blue, he is red.
[35:49.32]You can tell because we have a little circle around the person that we're controlling.
[35:52.80]Take those back.
[35:55.64]Now I need to do another fish fry.
[35:57.96]I also need two more flowers, please.
[36:01.46]Yes, I will give those to you, but don't pick this up.
[36:04.22]Don't touch that.
[36:07.34]Thanks for touching that after I told you specifically not to do it.
[36:12.54]Let's get these cleared.
[36:13.46]Okay, you need two bags of flour.
[36:17.06]Coming up.
[36:17.72]I do need...
[36:20.49]Give me this.
[36:21.15]That goes in here.
[36:22.79]We need another fish fry.
[36:23.75]Ooh, working like a well-oiled machine right now.
[36:28.70]Hey, look, we just have to figure it out.
[36:29.98]This takes a minute sometimes.
[36:31.26]No dishes, no dishes, no dishes.
[36:32.86]Clean these.
[36:33.30]No dishes.
[36:36.14]I'll be here all night.
[36:37.84]There's four of them.
[36:39.48]Oh, my thing's electrocuting.
[36:43.09]What else do we need?
[36:43.69]Okay, another fish.
[36:45.73]There's one dish at the very top.
[36:47.49]Thank you.
[36:48.65]What happened?
[36:49.83]It's at the very top.
[36:50.75]Oh, you already plated it.
[36:51.33]It's already got food on it.
[36:52.19]Okay.
[36:53.83]What about the other dish?
[36:59.13]Thank you.
[37:01.48]That's all of them.
[37:02.84]And I think you can have that.
[37:06.80]Dishes.
[37:07.08]Alright.
[37:08.18]There's a ready order up.
[37:12.39]I'll just put on a... It needs to go in the steamer.
[37:14.95]Alright, give me it.
[37:16.57]I gotta put the steamer back.
[37:18.59]This is just where you throw all your trash while cooking is the middle of this.
[37:23.15]We're just throwing everything there that doesn't have any place to go.
[37:26.45]We need fish.
[37:27.09]Hold on, I need fish.
[37:30.33]Okay, there's two fishes up here.
[37:32.19]Chop this one up too.
[37:33.05]That would be so gross if it was left out for that long.
[37:34.81]Alright, what if I put this also in here?
[37:37.73]Is that gonna be a problem?
[37:39.91]Uh, yes.
[37:40.77]It's just one recipe at a time.
[37:43.71]Oh, shit.
[37:44.03]Okay, I need, um... You need to do the two fishes.
[37:47.69]Uh, then we need, like, three flour.
[37:50.35]Are we gonna have enough time for that shit?
[37:52.53]We got a minute and 20 seconds.
[37:54.13]This is the secret level.
[37:55.49]Come on, get over here.
[37:58.83]Okay, you need flour?
[38:01.43]Two flowers, you said?
[38:02.17]No, you need four.
[38:03.29]I need three.
[38:03.97]One, two, three, four.
[38:08.54]Fish.
[38:10.36]Behind.
[38:13.36]Behind.
[38:16.20]Just don't say anything.
[38:17.50]Just fucking run into the guy.
[38:18.54]Yeah, let's just play in silence.
[38:19.82]It's ruining the game.
[38:20.94]I think the more we talk, the more we just ruin the game.
[38:25.19]Hey, you got some issues over there.
[38:27.01]See?
[38:27.35]Behind.
[38:27.79]Behind.
[38:32.42]Thank you.
[38:33.28]I didn't do anything, by the way.
[38:34.14]Because it's all you now.
[38:37.12]And now they're being passed back over.
[38:42.36]And then I turned around and I pushed the wrong button on the mixer.
[38:47.37]And I was freaking out.
[38:48.73]I wasn't going to get my cheese on the plate in time.
[38:51.51]Behind...
[38:54.64]That is a post-game interview with Jerma985 after the Overcooked 2 World Championships, losing in the final round.
[39:02.14]Do you have any plates over there?
[39:03.10]Do you have any plates over there?
[39:06.10]Any clean plates?
[39:07.42]Look, I got a lot of rolls to play.
[39:09.46]Just stick it on there right now.
[39:10.42]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[39:20.29]That's a two-star.
[39:21.51]That's the first two-star.
[39:22.73]But that's a secret level, though.
[39:24.80]That is the secret level.
[39:28.98]That was a secret hard level.
[39:30.26]That included us in the... Yeah, that's a secret level.
[39:35.41]Let's go into the DLC first.
[39:38.01]You would never do that.
[39:45.61]No, we're not redoing that right now.
[39:47.11]No, no, no.
[39:47.89]Don't listen to them.
[39:48.61]Go.
[39:49.13]Quick.
[39:50.39]Quick.
[39:50.97]Talics, drive away before they keep seeing this and they keep wanting us to beat this.
[39:54.53]Sorry, I accidentally muted.
[39:57.00]Can you drive the car?
[39:57.98]No, you're the only one.
[39:59.58]Look, there are two wheels.
[40:00.84]I'm in the driver's seat?
[40:02.18]Yeah, you're in the driver's seat.
[40:03.54]There's not a second wheel.
[40:05.64]Although there kind of should be, don't you think?
[40:06.98]Yeah, there should be.
[40:09.05]Why is that not a thing?
[40:12.69]While I play Pokémon Go, you can drive like
[40:17.45]Why are there not two brakes, two gas pedals, and two wheels in the front?
[40:22.44]This should be a driver's ed car.
[40:24.94]No, really.
[40:25.32]Think about that.
[40:25.90]What if you had a heart attack?
[40:26.82]I could just be like, I could grab it and just go.
[40:28.58]Okay, look.
[40:29.76]Everyone wants to talk shit?
[40:30.62]What do you think is in a plane?
[40:34.88]There are two... That's true.
[40:37.55]There are two wheels in a plane.
[40:39.37]There's a cockpit and a co-cockpit.
[40:43.16]Alright.
[40:44.22]No, there's just one cockpit.
[40:46.26]There's a pilot and a co-pilot.
[40:47.80]They have separate bathrooms.
[40:49.22]They have separate rooms.
[40:50.64]Alright, what are we doing?
[40:53.86]I have no idea.
[40:55.86]We're making sushi on an escalator.
[40:58.30]Same thing, so sushi.
[40:59.32]I need to think about where we're going to go.
[41:01.62]This is an airport walking helper.
[41:06.59]Alright, hold on.
[41:07.19]Wait, wait, wait.
[41:07.55]Where's the rice?
[41:10.13]All the ingredients are up here.
[41:11.15]Restart it.
[41:13.32]Why don't we just make sure there's not a new recipe, right?
[41:17.53]Okay.
[41:18.09]Two wheels, two cockpits, two bathrooms, two bedrooms.
[41:22.59]What do you guys think is up there?
[41:23.57]There's like two bathrooms, two baths.
[41:25.17]It's like a house.
[41:25.99]They're like truckers.
[41:28.31]They've got their own separate cab up on top that they can go up and sleep in the middle of the flight.
[41:33.54]Autopilot has come so far in the last 20 years, those guys aren't even needed anymore.
[41:37.60]They just go and take a nap in the front.
[41:40.38]Alright, here we go.
[41:41.32]I'll be on rice duty.
[41:43.48]But why would you come over here to my side first thing and claim it as your own?
[41:49.06]Well, then one of us has to be up and one of us has to be down.
[41:51.98]Watch this.
[41:52.74]You want to see a cool trick?
[41:53.96]Watch this.
[41:55.00]No, I don't like tricks.
[41:55.74]Magic tricks scare me.
[41:56.50]I don't understand how they work.
[41:57.72]Here comes the rice.
[41:58.52]Okay, that's fine.
[42:00.44]But what do I do with it now?
[42:02.14]You need to take this.
[42:04.32]What's going on?
[42:05.10]No, give me this.
[42:07.88]I can play that game too.
[42:09.18]No, I can't.
[42:10.22]What the fuck is this doing?
[42:11.04]Alright, Etalyx.
[42:13.73]Are you pressing X?
[42:14.97]How are you letting it go there?
[42:18.19]Would you like to know?
[42:19.14]How are you doing that?
[42:19.74]Because, honest to God, I like... Would you like to know how to do my funny joke?
[42:22.12]How do you do the funny joke?
[42:25.85]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[42:27.65]I can't drop this on the conveyor.
[42:29.65]I guess I just can't.
[42:30.85]No, I can't.
[42:31.73]You can't drop these.
[42:32.31]You can't.
[42:32.65]You just have to not be aiming at another table.
[42:36.46]You can't hit A to drop them?
[42:37.46]It just went fucking behind me.
[42:38.68]No, you can't drop these.
[42:40.94]Alright, do it again.
[42:42.32]Let me see what happens if I do this.
[42:43.38]I physically can't get through.
[42:45.54]There.
[42:45.84]No, for me, it's X throws it.
[42:49.36]Behind.
[42:49.82]Wait, are you playing with a PS4 controller?
[42:52.85]Wait, we're going to have a snowball fight?
[42:55.63]Alright, fuck cooking.
[42:56.39]Who cares?
[42:56.83]Burn this place to the ground.
[43:00.75]Yeah, you really can't drop these anymore, can you?
[43:02.39]Well, I almost got you.
[43:04.25]How are you throwing those?
[43:06.28]Wait, wouldn't you like to know?
[43:07.24]Oh, there is a throw.
[43:10.86]Wow.
[43:11.58]Alright, I'm learning something new.
[43:14.58]Gotcha.
[43:15.40]No, you didn't.
[43:16.80]Oh, yeah, I did.
[43:17.40]No, we're playing like fourth grade tag.
[43:19.44]It's the honor system.
[43:21.44]Yeah, you've already proven to be a dishonorable and conniving nemesis.
[43:25.78]How stupid was that, by the way?
[43:28.46]That one asshole kid, you would put both hands on him and tag him with both hands.
[43:33.08]Didn't he touch me?
[43:33.72]And he'd like smile at you and like keep running and just like, fuck that kid.
[43:40.67]He knows.
[43:43.07]Nice catch.
[43:44.77]Oh my god, there's a fire!
[43:45.63]Yeah, the whole kitchen is actually on fire.
[43:56.06]Fine, you can put an obstacle in my way.
[43:57.34]I'll still get it.
[44:00.06]Rice does not light on fire.
[44:09.35]You can plate food by throwing.
[44:11.07]You understand that?
[44:13.21]Like, you just toss the plate at the food.
[44:15.69]And you get to go, like, um...

[47:49.46]Alright, now it's emote, man.
[47:51.90]That's before.
[47:52.64]Yeah, we're washed up.
[47:59.53]We'll get two stars for this one.
[48:03.17]We did three stars.
[48:04.05]We'll get three.
[48:04.71]Everyone talking all the spec.
[48:05.51]What were we even panicking about?
[48:07.37]What were we doing?
[48:08.07]We were fine.
[48:09.51]I felt like we were about to one star that one.
[48:12.87]No, there's just too high of a standard here right now.
[48:17.79]Lower your standards a little bit, guys.
[48:31.01]We're getting... Is this the last level of the first chapter?
[48:33.43]Oh, this is the end of the game.
[48:36.77]Overcooked 2.
[48:37.27]They ran out of development.
[48:38.35]They ran out of money.
[48:39.93]There's five levels in the game.
[48:43.36]Yeah, that was a fun game.
[48:44.36]I enjoyed it.
[48:44.78]It was pretty good.
[48:47.78]How big is this, actually?
[48:48.86]Dude, you're not supposed to be doing that.
[48:52.66]We haven't uncovered that part of the map yet.
[48:55.65]So is this going to be the 100% gamer?
[48:59.03]Three star every level?
[49:00.27]Are we on a giant beehive?
[49:06.17]How timely.
[49:06.95]How relevant.
[49:07.89]You're hacking in an RTS right now.
[49:11.67]You're in the fog of war.
[49:13.21]Yeah, you're in the fog.
[49:14.05]You're playing as a scout unit right now.
[49:15.69]Remember Red Alert?
[49:18.76]Okay, there you go.
[49:20.20]Did you play Command & Conquer Red Alert?
[49:22.12]Yeah.
[49:22.78]I played Tiberian, whatever.
[49:24.70]So you remember what I'm talking about where you used to take the truck.
[49:28.40]You'd take the ore truck and you'd bring it all the way to the other end of the map because it was a shitload of diamonds and cocoa pebbles.
[49:34.15]No, what are they called?
[49:34.71]Fruity pebbles.
[49:35.79]And gold and shit.
[49:36.55]You would send the one dump truck up there to go do it.
[49:40.41]And just hope nobody ever noticed you.
[49:44.89]I miss that game.
[49:46.01]Remember Tanya?
[49:47.35]You remember back when real-time strategy games were fun?
[49:50.53]D-A-E.
[49:51.15]I just remember building power plant next to power plant next to power plant to build into the other person's base across the entire game and then build a hundred Tesla coils inside of their base.
[50:06.34]That game was so much fun.
[50:10.28]You had a trail of power plants.
[50:12.18]Did you read the instructions?
[50:16.50]No, I didn't.
[50:17.08]Not at all.
[50:17.60]We're on a hot air balloon now.
[50:19.13]I don't know.
[50:19.49]This thing falls.
[50:21.75]Slightly dramatic change in scenery.
[50:23.79]So we just have to saute.
[50:26.67]So you got tomato.
[50:29.13]Chop this up for you.
[50:29.94]It's going to be chopped up, right?
[50:32.08]That's a fucking fire extinguisher.
[50:38.73]Just put it on my side.
[50:40.11]I'm trying to fucking throw it because I don't want it here anymore.
[50:42.37]Okay.
[50:43.25]So... You saute the macaroni.
[50:47.30]Now it comes back.
[50:47.90]I thought that was a cutting board.
[50:51.52]I think... How do you cook macaroni?
[50:53.64]Because it goes in the pot.
[50:56.34]You don't saute the macaroni.
[50:58.62]Okay.
[50:59.25]That's true.
[51:00.09]That's true.
[51:00.49]Yeah, just burn the macaroni to a little crisp.
[51:03.63]I like my macaroni extra crunchy.
[51:06.11]The world is moving.
[51:10.51]That would be disgusting.
[51:15.65]That would be so bad.
[51:18.55]Okay, there you go.
[51:19.59]Alright, this is a very confusing level.
[51:21.53]Hold on.
[51:22.05]Oh, we need some motivators.
[51:24.34]You're the only one doing anything.
[51:26.04]Bravo.
[51:28.54]I can't get over it.
[51:29.26]You're doing great.
[51:30.20]I can't get over putting macaroni in a saucepan.
[51:34.78]Oh, really high heat.
[51:37.22]How do we turn these in?
[51:38.24]Oh.
[51:44.08]Alright, I'm just chopping up tomatoes right now.
[51:46.80]That's a guy.
[51:47.32]Okay, that's the kind of mistake that a four-year-old makes if you asked how to cook tomatoes or cook macaroni.
[51:54.85]You just turn on the stove as hot as it can possibly go.
[51:58.29]Turn on the fucking burner as hot as it can possibly be and then dump it in there.
[52:02.75]And then dump whatever food you want cooked in there.
[52:04.89]Alright, so why is this... This is not on the right thing.
[52:10.00]No, we need macaroni.
[52:14.96]and ride up yep wait I need to cook it not saute it alright we got this one is done this one is done we've got two hot soups here waiting for macaroni give me another macaroni they're both cooking goodbye give me another one okay I will after the first one's been used okay nice sorry no no no what are you doing I stole it give it give it here
[52:45.48]Okay, we need a $10 tip on that.
[52:46.60]Get out.
[52:47.46]Get out.
[52:48.54]Uh, plates.
[52:48.98]What are we doing on plates?
[52:49.78]Are we alright?
[52:52.44]I cleaned two of them.
[52:53.82]Good to go.
[52:54.26]Got two more macaronis coming right up.
[52:56.22]We need to put the pans on the burner and start cooking the tomatoes, please.
[53:00.46]I'm washing dishes right now.
[53:03.61]So wait, is this done macaroni?
[53:05.99]We have to make a sauce.
[53:08.01]Don't forget the sauce.
[53:10.45]Okay, we got to get another macaroni in that pot.
[53:15.05]Thank you.
[53:16.29]What about plates?
[53:16.81]We got plates anywhere?
[53:17.45]We got one?
[53:18.45]There's one plate.
[53:19.29]Where are the other ones?
[53:23.45]I need to be cleaned.
[53:24.17]I'm going to throw this to you.
[53:25.43]Ready?
[53:25.67]I'm going to throw it.
[53:26.25]I only see one plate.
[53:28.13]I almost just dropped that into the ocean.
[53:30.95]Well, we're not above water, but yes, I understand the cinema.
[53:35.81]Alright.
[53:36.03]We got any more plates?
[53:37.42]Got one more done here.
[53:39.76]It's the fire in the middle, like the little hot air fire is really throwing me off.
[53:43.44]It really is.
[53:44.48]I feel like the kitchen is constantly ablaze.
[53:47.23]I got the dishes going.
[53:47.93]Okay.
[53:53.23]Sorry.
[53:54.07]Got a one, got a two.
[53:55.95]Uh-oh.
[53:59.23]Somehow we seem to be picking the exact same spot to run in every time.
[54:04.15]Well, I mean, there's really only one way to get into this room.
[54:06.83]Okay, you need a plate.
[54:08.08]At a time.
[54:11.51]You want to handle that?
[54:17.01]Alley-oop.
[54:19.23]Okay, looking good.
[54:22.17]Hi?
[54:23.77]What?
[54:24.19]No, somebody said something.
[54:29.26]Is this literally another only serves macaroni restaurant?
[54:34.72]Like, there's a million of these.
[54:36.36]Hey, we serve what you order, chat.
[54:39.26]Any- any hot- Ahhhh.
[54:41.72]What a shitty menu that really is though, think about that.
[54:50.85]That's the easiest thing in the world to make.
[54:53.55]Just take elbow macaroni, put it in a pot, and then dump tomato sauce on it.
[54:58.81]Imagine paying a restaurant to do that for you.
[55:00.71]It's called Olive Garden.
[55:07.35]I would agree with you, but no endless soup, salad, and breadsticks.
[55:12.33]You know, you can only buy so much.
[55:17.19]If you go to the grocery store and you buy a bunch of breadsticks, eventually you're going to run out.
[55:21.49]They don't.
[55:26.37]What's this one?
[55:27.67]We're just on the up-in-the-air levels.
[55:29.39]Okay, so this is a bunch of complicated salads.
[55:32.59]I give up.
[55:32.97]I quit.
[55:33.61]Well, the first one's two ingredients, so...
[55:38.71]At least now we've got a nutritious, steady diet of tomatoes and cucumbers there.
[55:43.99]Is that good enough for you to eat a salad?
[55:45.87]No.
[55:47.18]Still no.
[55:47.84]Not good enough.
[55:49.26]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[55:50.10]What's with the fire?
[55:50.70]Why is there a fire over here?
[55:51.50]Do we have to deal with that?
[55:52.60]Do we have to deal with this fire?
[55:54.56]Do we have to step on this?
[55:57.08]I don't understand why this is here.
[55:59.55]Why does it have a life bar?
[56:02.81]Wait, what's going on?
[56:04.59]I think the blimp is catching fire.
[56:07.11]Oh.
[56:08.54]And we do not have a fire extinguisher.
[56:10.46]Okay, so what?
[56:11.56]I feel like we have to stomp on these.
[56:15.42]That's what I would do.
[56:18.04]I don't think so.
[56:19.84]I think they just go out by themselves.
[56:21.52]Oh, there's a storm.
[56:24.11]Things are starting to get dramatic here.
[56:25.87]Alright.
[56:26.15]Well, let me just be real here.
[56:27.69]If you were in a thunderstorm and the balloon was going down, I don't think you'd give a shit about eating a salad right now.
[56:33.88]I think we'd be running around screaming.
[56:35.34]There's people that need to eat these salads, okay?
[56:38.76]I need a tomato, and I need it chopped yesterday.
[56:40.80]Alright.
[56:45.08]Well, now we just need a bunch of lettuce.
[56:46.92]Lettuce on plates.
[56:47.56]Plates are on the other side.
[56:49.18]Just only lettuce.
[56:50.70]Lettuce on plates.
[56:51.31]That's all we need.
[56:58.84]Lettuce on plates.
[56:59.48]Got lettuce.
[57:01.12]Just hand me lettuce.
[57:01.80]I'm gonna chop like five of them.
[57:03.06]I gotta make the plates clean.
[57:06.22]It's getting windy in here.
[57:07.84]What's going on?
[57:09.25]I can't chop.
[57:09.69]You can't chop against the wind.
[57:11.75]What are we, a goddamn salmon?
[57:13.81]They're blocking the plate with the fire.
[57:15.37]I'm stuck in here now.
[57:16.03]No, I'm not.
[57:20.59]Turn it in and lettuce and tomatoes.
[57:27.93]I'm gonna go clean the plate.
[57:30.25]I think we lost.
[57:33.33]We just died.
[57:37.15]No, we're still going.
[57:38.71]We survived.
[57:39.99]We just crashed into someone else's restaurant, killed the owners of that restaurant, and started cooking in their place.
[57:46.23]It's our turn now.
[57:47.01]Well, whatever.
[57:47.53]We just killed everybody here.
[57:50.93]That's alright.
[57:51.47]So what were they doing in here?
[57:52.27]They were making sushi.
[57:53.41]So what's the next step here?
[57:55.99]Yeah, we're transitioning from the last salads to sushi.
[57:58.61]And this is a sushi conveyor belt situation.
[58:01.71]I need one lettuce.
[58:02.97]Just do the fucking salad part.
[58:04.35]Lettuce and tomato.
[58:04.81]Do the closest ones first.
[58:09.35]Now this one is done.
[58:14.20]Did they at least... No, they don't clean out plates.
[58:19.04]Okay, we need a full salad.
[58:20.28]Everything.
[58:20.68]Full salad.
[58:22.50]Everything on it.
[58:25.44]Including hots.
[58:26.33]Two of them.
[58:31.37]All clean.
[58:31.77]Okay, I'm going to get the next lettuce done.
[58:36.51]Preparing.
[58:37.21]I accidentally split down that.
[58:39.13]Just stand right there with the plate.
[58:41.77]Okay, good.
[58:42.74]Cucumber.
[58:44.32]What am I stuck on?
[58:46.96]I think we both got confused.
[58:48.40]I thought I was you and you were me.
[58:49.68]That was wrong.
[58:50.36]I said cucumber.
[58:51.70]Whatever.
[58:52.20]Whatever.
[58:56.57]Done.
[58:58.49]Alright.
[58:59.01]Again.
[59:00.51]Interestingly enough, I don't know what kind of sustainability this restaurant has, but if the food is not used on the conveyor belt, it goes into the trash.
[59:09.22]Yeah, directly into the garbage.
[59:10.84]It's just a waste.
[59:12.90]Now we have to make sushi.
[59:13.80]There's absolutely no way.
[59:16.94]The pots are over here.
[59:18.26]Why would you do that?
[59:21.81]We didn't even get one sushi order done.
[59:24.07]Thousands of dollars of food waste.
[59:26.55]At least put it back in the fridge.
[59:27.71]Why am I taking the lettuce out?
[59:28.73]They're coming in, like, from the customers.
[59:30.07]It doesn't even matter.
[59:30.77]This is just extra bonus time.
[59:34.24]Like, we can make one.
[59:36.16]I don't even know... Oh, they come off the conveyor right here.
[59:38.40]So, okay.
[59:38.98]Give me... Whatever.
[59:39.98]We got four stars.
[59:45.96]That's where the breadsticks from Olive Garden come from.
[59:52.17]They just throw them away if nobody eats them.
[59:54.39]Where's your sense of urgencies?
[59:57.35]We got three stars, is that not urgent enough?
[59:59.73]We just did it the best you can possibly do.
[60:06.53]That's the best you can do in the whole game.
[60:08.47]It's three.
[60:08.87]Yeah.
[60:09.86]Also, hang on.
[60:14.38]He told me to hang on.
[60:15.04]I'm hanging on.
[60:18.10]Why'd he say that?
[60:19.38]What's happening?
[60:20.68]Is everything okay?
[60:22.78]Hang on, hang on.
[60:23.64]Hold on a second, he's gone.
[60:25.68]Hope everything's alright.
[60:31.81]Pacing back and forth in the waiting room.
[60:34.53]Come on.
[60:35.07]Come on.
[60:36.05]Is the baby out yet?
[60:36.79]Is it a girl?
[60:38.53]Is it a boy?
[60:38.99]I just don't know.
[60:41.51]No one said anything to me.
[60:43.30]The doctor hasn't been out here in like five minutes.
[60:55.20]But really, what is he doing?
[60:59.75]Where's one seven?
[61:00.63]What are you doing?
[61:01.93]I don't... Is it a girl or a boy?
[61:03.73]Just tell me.
[61:06.84]It's a girl!
[61:12.32]Where's the next objective?
[61:13.48]Right there.
[61:14.26]The castle.
[61:14.80]The castle?
[61:15.54]Yeah.
[61:16.18]That's where we started.
[61:17.50]Yeah, well, we have to go back, and he's going to be a cutscene.
[61:24.24]See?
[61:24.50]Okay.
[61:26.19]You handle that.
[61:27.63]What an adventure you've been on.
[61:28.53]You've only just begun.
[61:29.27]Ah, sorry.
[61:34.23]I had to hit the okay button.
[61:36.25]You still have much to learn about copper operation and head out into the wild.
[61:38.94]I hear there are flavors.
[61:40.04]Bark!
[61:40.92]Don't hurry me.
[61:41.68]Okay.
[61:48.46]So we just have to go in and check up on him.
[61:58.82]See?
[62:01.12]That was chapter one.
[62:07.73]I'm so glad you went through the two buoys.
[62:09.89]I would have had a panic attack if you didn't.
[62:14.55]Okay, throw.
[62:21.64]Only raw ingredients can be thrown.
[62:24.84]They should have put the F word in front of raw.
[62:27.63]And then put like a smiley face or something.
[62:30.05]Where is he?
[62:30.61]Alright, what are we doing?
[62:35.81]Oh, we're on a ramp.
[62:36.71]You can only throw raw ingredients.
[62:38.71]You have to throw them to me.
[62:39.57]I chop, chop, chop, and I throw them back.
[62:41.26]Give me the cookie.
[62:42.78]That's a potato.
[62:44.68]Cookie caught.
[62:45.74]What does this look like to you?
[62:47.16]That looks like a dog toy.
[62:54.19]Ooh, that was close.
[62:54.83]Ooh, close one.
[62:57.01]Wait, what?
[62:57.47]Okay, so we are actually making fried chicken now.
[63:00.01]I can't do anything.
[63:00.61]This is all you.
[63:04.20]Wow, why do I get, like, the extra difficult job?
[63:06.82]Because you're a better gamer than me.
[63:09.06]They could sense it.
[63:11.98]Don't take off.
[63:12.60]Don't do more than you can handle.
[63:14.76]Don't take more than you can handle.
[63:15.82]Alright, so there's your chicken tendies.
[63:19.07]Here's your french fries.
[63:20.03]Don't really say it like that.
[63:22.73]You just caused such a huge problem.
[63:25.55]Rose by any other name smells just as sweet.
[63:29.61]What do I do?
[63:30.15]There are too many words in that sentence.
[63:31.65]Can you make it dumber for me?
[63:35.45]Just throw me the hot oil.
[63:36.55]Throw the oil into my face.
[63:38.67]Come on, burn me.
[63:39.91]Burn me.
[63:41.35]Hey, I got it.
[63:46.33]Oh, shit.
[63:47.96]Come on.
[63:48.32]10 D's.
[63:50.86]I fucking got it.
[63:53.84]Bill crazy, that's right.
[63:56.38]We're doing something insane today.
[63:58.20]We're going to play catch with hot oil.
[64:00.54]I'm not even going to wear gloves.
[64:09.61]Etalyx.
[64:10.13]Etalyx.
[64:12.75]I'm having some difficulties over here, okay?
[64:15.17]There's kind of a lot of jobs.
[64:16.87]All you have to do is hit X on the chopping board.
[64:19.31]And you forgot the most important thing is fucking dance.
[64:21.93]Oh, no, never mind.
[64:26.02]What are they even eating?
[64:27.54]This is actually just chicken.
[64:29.43]Fried chicken and french fries.
[64:31.43]Yeah!
[64:32.73]This is the definition of the thing that must not be named, apparently.
[64:36.67]Where are the vitamins?
[64:39.35]At least put some goddamn Ovaltine on there.
[64:41.09]You know what I mean?
[64:41.51]Like the Ovaltine powder.
[64:42.55]Sprinkle it on there.
[64:43.31]Alright, I'm coming for a hug.
[64:50.15]No, I can't.
[64:52.22]Look at that.
[64:52.82]Look at that finale that I just did.
[64:54.58]Like six orders in a row.
[64:57.10]Boom, $423.
[64:59.10]Sorry, I'm just a little tired about that.
[65:04.85]No, good job, man.
[65:05.79]Good work.
[65:09.11]Four stars.
[65:22.69]And that's it.
[65:23.55]See you guys next time.
[65:25.19]Hope you guys enjoy.
[65:27.21]Uh-oh.
[65:28.21]Hello?
[65:29.23]Are you still here?
[65:32.31]Vaguely.
[65:33.19]What happened?
[65:34.29]You have been disconnected from online services.
[65:36.86]What happened?
[65:37.52]Did we lose our progress?
[65:41.86]We did not lose progress.
[65:44.36]However, I did lose you.
[65:45.50]Uh-oh.
[65:47.96]And also my stream.
[65:49.54]Oh, that's not good.
[65:52.05]I am at zero kilobits per second.
[65:56.06]Oh.
[65:57.66]Well, shit.
[66:01.20]Hmm, well.
[66:03.94]You should be able to join off me, though.
[66:05.84]I'm having some Comcast.
[66:07.34]I'm just coming down with a little bit of, you know, no internet.
[66:12.47]Because, as you know, everything's been going too smoothly for the last hour, and because we are doing a co-op stream...
[66:21.47]there is no option, except to have something go wrong.
[66:26.23]Can I just invite you?
[66:27.63]No, wait, is it gonna be on your save file or something?
[66:31.91]Should I just invite you?
[66:34.47]And we're back.
[66:35.79]You're back?
[66:36.57]You good?
[66:37.97]I don't see you on, are you online?
[66:42.42]I was.
[66:42.74]Oh, I've been disconnected.
[66:45.14]I think, wait, what happened?
[66:46.04]No, no, no, okay, never mind.
[66:47.82]I'm back.
[66:50.69]No, that wasn't you guys.
[66:51.61]That wasn't your Steam.
[66:52.57]It was my Steam.
[66:53.31]I know everybody just checked.
[66:55.70]Everybody just alt-tabbed.
[66:56.92]I'm sorry.
[66:57.44]It's contagious.
[67:00.56]I got what you had.
[67:01.68]Yeah, it sucks.
[67:06.42]Alright.
[67:07.24]And I think we're back.
[67:08.70]I don't use Steam.
[67:09.66]Smiley face.
[67:12.60]You got a message at the same time.
[67:16.33]We saved our progress.
[67:16.91]We're good.
[67:19.33]So are you, your stream good?
[67:21.85]You're good to go?
[67:22.67]How you doing?
[67:25.42]I think so.
[67:25.94]Just give me one sec to make sure everything's okay.
[67:30.64]Jerma keeps cold soup in his pockets.
[67:33.42]It would dry up.
[67:34.66]That's impossible.
[67:40.15]I do.
[67:45.41]Jerma accepted my trade request.
[67:52.19]Steam trading.
[67:57.90]Free quest.
[68:02.24]No hornets yet, so that's good.
[68:05.42]I probably shouldn't say that too loud because they'll probably hear me.
[68:09.50]Just start buzzing in here.
[68:14.42]Get swarmed.
[68:19.00]Eat the hornets.
[68:21.33]Hey, in 2200, you will be.
[68:25.45]That'll be a treat in 200 years.
[68:29.53]Mom came home with a bag of hornets.
[68:32.45]Whoa!
[68:33.25]We're having hornets tonight?
[68:34.27]Sauteed hornets?
[68:35.61]With peppers, onions, and pasta?
[68:38.09]No fucking way!
[68:40.43]That's right, kids.
[68:43.17]You're gonna buy deli meat.
[68:44.23]You know how you're gonna buy deli meat?
[68:45.19]That ain't gonna exist anymore.
[68:47.44]You think we're living sustainable enough lives where shaved pig is still gonna exist in 200 years?
[68:53.22]Nope, there's gonna be a bunch of mealworms, bugs, hornets, spiders, and it's gonna be real normal.
[69:06.48]They'll be laughing.
[69:08.39]Two or three hundred years from now, somebody will watch that video of the wasps, and they'll be like, oh my god, if he only knew.
[69:16.30]That's 200 bucks a pop now.
[69:18.22]Wow, the world has sure changed.
[69:20.44]They used to just kill these things?
[69:22.31]Oh, thank god you're back.
[69:23.43]Let's go.
[69:28.43]I think we're okay.
[69:30.03]Are you okay?
[69:30.95]I'm good.
[69:31.83]I'm being alright.
[69:34.22]What was going on in the background?
[69:36.10]We were talking about food and how we're going to be eating bugs only.
[69:39.82]I think we were... You were talking about the cockpits and co-cockpits earlier.
[69:44.62]Yeah.
[69:45.61]Don't know if you noticed, but we're in an airplane magic school bus now.
[69:49.55]Yeah, this guy stands on two legs.
[69:51.65]What the fuck?
[69:53.71]Weird.
[69:57.06]They didn't come up with the... When did they come up with the concept of floatation?
[70:00.50]I'm surprised.
[70:01.40]He's on two legs.
[70:02.86]Alright.
[70:03.78]This one's gonna move around.
[70:05.38]Macaroni started.
[70:06.20]Macaroni... Macaroni and meat.
[70:09.77]Interesting.
[70:10.31]Okay.
[70:10.57]Okay.
[70:14.59]People aren't even gonna have legs.
[70:16.27]It'll just be... What are you... What is this conversation?
[70:18.87]We're talking about evolution.
[70:20.67]People are gonna just be floating around with tiny little baby legs and baby feet.
[70:24.66]Okay, but why would they be flying?
[70:26.28]Because we're going to figure out teleportation by the year 2200.
[70:29.83]Teleportation?
[70:30.93]I mean, temptation.
[70:33.55]What are we saying?
[70:34.23]Floatation.
[70:34.83]Oh, these are going to burn.
[70:40.73]Is that done?
[70:41.69]I hope we figure out teleportation.
[70:43.25]Then we won't need arms or legs.
[70:44.61]We can just go wherever we need to.
[70:47.52]We can just be that one TV show that I hate from...
[70:53.03]Do we need any macaroni on that?
[70:54.47]Yeah, we do.
[70:55.29]Macaroni on here.
[70:57.63]And then lobster tail on here.
[70:59.83]There's too much going on.
[71:01.67]I feel sensory overload right now.
[71:03.16]I need fish.
[71:04.32]You need to get a fish.
[71:05.94]Just put the beef on there.
[71:07.08]No, no, no.
[71:08.28]Do the orders in order.
[71:10.32]This one is macaroni, lobster, and fish.
[71:13.26]This is not macaroni, lobster, and beef.
[71:14.82]The fish is cooking.
[71:16.94]Just for you.
[71:18.32]Thank you.
[71:19.90]There's also a...
[71:22.16]There's like four burners.
[71:24.12]There's a lot coming out here.
[71:25.14]I think we might have to throw some shit at each other.
[71:30.17]Okay, so how about this?
[71:32.39]How about, um, let's start over.
[71:34.11]I'll be in the middle and the left.
[71:35.93]You be on the right.
[71:37.33]And we'll just throw stuff at each other.
[71:39.47]I need macaroni macaroni meat.
[71:41.73]Macaroni macaroni meat.
[71:42.85]Can you handle it?
[71:43.57]Macaroni macaroni meat.
[71:45.45]Macaroni macaroni meat.
[71:47.72]Literally both of those things are inaccessible to me right now.
[71:50.26]What?
[71:51.39]You just fell off.
[71:52.88]Yeah, I tried to make the jump.
[71:54.04]I was seeing if I could jump the gap.
[71:56.92]Ow, my fucking head.
[71:58.34]You didn't even say behind.
[71:59.28]That's why we bumped into each other.
[72:01.54]What's going on?
[72:03.42]Just saving us the teeth pulling.
[72:05.93]Later.
[72:07.09]Okay.
[72:07.49]Alright.
[72:07.87]What do you need first?
[72:08.69]We need... We're on opposite sides.
[72:10.19]Meat and macaroni.
[72:12.13]Macaroni, meat.
[72:13.13]Macaroni, lobster, fish.
[72:16.61]Macaroni, meat.
[72:17.60]Macaroni, lobster, fish.
[72:21.37]Macaroni, lobster, fish.
[72:22.77]Macaroni, lobster, fish.
[72:24.91]Just think of it.
[72:25.31]Remember it like a phone number.
[72:27.46]Macaroni, lobster.
[72:28.56]Macaroni, lobster, fish.
[72:30.46]I barely know my own phone number.
[72:33.24]Oh my god.
[72:33.54]I'm too busy thinking about phone numbers.
[72:39.53]Maybe I... Now I get the easy job for once.
[72:42.17]I'm going to help.
[72:44.29]What do you need?
[72:45.01]I need... There's a lot of macaroni.
[72:46.01]I did throw a lot of macaroni around here.
[72:47.15]You threw a lot of macaroni over here.
[72:48.19]Hold on.
[72:48.35]We need macaroni, lobster...
[72:51.01]Yep, the macaroni's cooking again.
[72:53.65]I gotta get the phone number thing out of my head.
[72:55.02]I'm fucking up everything.
[72:57.84]This isn't even done.
[73:00.76]Alright, so we need simple macaroni meat.
[73:03.78]Okay, you just tell me what we need.
[73:05.70]Alright, I'll call it out.
[73:06.52]Alright, now we need macaroni, shrimp, and fish.
[73:09.17]Macaroni, shrimp, and fish.
[73:10.87]So put the fish on the current... There it is.
[73:12.77]Perfect.
[73:13.29]I'm waiting until I can turn in.
[73:18.10]There's no fucking room over here.
[73:18.88]Okay, then we need macaroni, shrimp, and fish again.
[73:21.20]Got it right here.
[73:22.14]Take it from me.
[73:24.58]Now we need mac... What's the next thing after that?
[73:29.36]You need shrimp and fish again.
[73:30.96]Same thing.
[73:31.38]Shrimp, fish.
[73:33.52]Just let it go.
[73:34.04]Let it go.
[73:34.48]I'll handle it.
[73:35.10]No, you threw it off the edge.
[73:39.00]Thank you.
[73:39.74]Nice.
[73:40.56]Okay, and then macaroni, meat, the classic.
[73:43.54]Okay, macaroni, meat.
[73:44.44]Hold on.
[73:44.76]One at a time here.
[73:45.36]That was just one thing.
[73:49.69]So what's the next one coming up?
[73:51.13]Macaroni?
[73:52.26]Macaroni meat.
[73:53.30]Macaroni lobster.
[73:57.16]Macaroni lobster fish?
[73:57.86]Macaroni lobster fish is the immediate one.
[74:04.17]There it is.
[74:05.93]And then macaroni... Meat.
[74:08.29]Macaroni meat.
[74:09.43]Got it.
[74:11.05]There's already cooked mac.
[74:12.57]And then macaroni shrimp fish.
[74:15.08]Is this cooked?
[74:16.84]Oh, it's too late.
[74:21.98]Alright, Mac, what's next?
[74:23.86]These two.
[74:27.98]Bin, macaroni, meat.
[74:29.34]I feel like you probably shouldn't be asking that question if you were a chef.
[74:32.68]And then serve it.
[74:34.70]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[74:35.64]Is that cooked?
[74:36.68]Just whatever, who cares?
[74:42.24]I don't... Get the fucking fire extinguisher out of here.
[74:45.48]You got 15 seconds to get this order in.
[74:48.58]Is there a plate?
[74:49.02]Macaroni, shrimp.
[74:53.94]No, no, you just put it back on the burner.
[74:56.02]I got fish here.
[74:57.88]I need macaroni.
[74:58.86]I got macaroni here.
[75:00.66]No, no, no, this one is.
[75:03.11]Take it, go.
[75:04.83]Okay, now we need macaroni.
[75:06.51]Okay, I got macaroni meat.
[75:10.43]Just a ton of macaroni meat.
[75:12.45]Just throw all macaroni meat over here.
[75:15.32]Nothing else.
[75:15.68]Uh-oh.
[75:18.98]Just keep it going.
[75:20.18]We may have a problem.
[75:20.90]Come on.
[75:25.09]I'm stuck on the other side.
[75:26.33]This isn't even chopped up.
[75:29.25]You didn't get to chop that up.
[75:30.45]Yeah, because I couldn't get to the middle.
[75:37.20]Is that not done?
[75:38.34]Oh, my fucking God.
[75:39.92]We got 300 points.
[75:42.10]It was barely enough for the two-star.
[75:44.56]Time up.
[75:45.54]That one was weird.
[75:46.96]Come on, Grandma.
[75:48.20]No, that was a hard one.
[75:51.19]And it's only going to get worse.
[75:53.15]Back in Velveeto.
[75:57.37]Um, don't eat Velveeta, guys.
[76:00.87]Why?
[76:02.01]You know, Velveeta is like 44% soft plastic.
[76:07.21]They add cheese-flavored dust.
[76:08.11]You're about to be sued, sir.
[76:10.07]I am a majority stakeholder in Velveeta.
[76:13.45]No, that's just my opinion.
[76:14.31]I'm playing a character.
[76:15.25]I'm like playing an opinion character.
[76:17.21]I'm safe.
[76:21.23]We're casting new roles for opinion characters?
[76:24.55]Send your applications in to Velveeta, and we'll hook you up with a new commercial.
[76:29.93]We're trying to outreach more to the streamers and online entertainers crowd.
[76:34.73]New character.
[76:35.25]Yeah, hold on a second.
[76:36.96]Hey, everybody, it's me.
[76:38.18]My name is Davey Dickey, and I'll tell you right now, Velveeta's made out of plastic.
[76:43.12]Ho-ho, it sure is.
[76:45.12]See, that's not me.
[76:45.90]That was like a dumb, shitty character that...
[76:49.36]That was a 1940s advertisement, but what you didn't think about was that would have been a selling point in the 1940s.
[76:57.72]They just ate asbestos and plastic Velveeta back then.
[77:01.56]That was perfectly acceptable.
[77:02.83]Doctors were telling you to smoke cigarettes on TV.
[77:05.97]Yeah.
[77:09.25]They were.
[77:09.73]Alright, hold on.
[77:10.85]We need macaroni meat, macaroni meat, macaroni meat, macaroni meat, macaroni meat, macaroni meat, macaroni meat, macaroni meat.
[77:20.87]Wait, Tom.
[77:21.29]Tell me more.
[77:24.37]Oh, my God.
[77:25.05]So funny.
[77:26.33]So funny.
[77:28.07]I need plates and shit.
[77:29.08]Hold on.
[77:29.46]Can you take that?
[77:31.90]Oh, I definitely can.
[77:32.76]Okay, so you have to do that shit.
[77:35.36]Yeah.
[77:35.80]And one of us also, we have to serve the people at the bottom somehow, too.
[77:40.04]No, that's just for show.
[77:41.70]I don't need that much.
[77:42.84]You need that for the future.
[77:44.10]I need another meat.
[77:45.76]Hold on.
[77:46.00]You need two mushrooms.
[77:47.10]I'm just getting you the ingredients that you need.
[77:48.52]And then you need another meat.
[77:50.99]I have to catch everything you throw over here, so just tell me when you're going to do it.
[77:57.33]No, you have to chop the meat.
[78:00.31]No, throw it back.
[78:03.79]That was actually pretty sick.
[78:04.77]That was a trick shot.
[78:06.22]I just did a trick shot.
[78:07.64]Alright.
[78:08.54]Oh, well, I can chop it, too.
[78:11.98]We need to chop the mushrooms?
[78:14.46]You have to serve this.
[78:15.66]Throw it.
[78:16.62]I can't throw it.
[78:18.54]What?
[78:18.88]No, put it down there.
[78:22.24]It has to come over to you.
[78:23.66]Alright, so I'm having trouble.
[78:27.34]Me too.
[78:28.09]I mean, I do see that you're standing there, but now so am I. We're wistfully looking at each other, wondering how destiny separated us so.
[78:33.57]Alright, so we're going to get double points for this one.
[78:35.17]Just put us on the same.
[78:36.23]Okay.
[78:39.40]There are three hot air balloons.
[78:41.18]So I'm going to chop and throw.
[78:42.28]So here you go.
[78:42.62]Here's chopped mushrooms.
[78:43.56]Chopped mushrooms.
[78:46.40]Chopped mushrooms.
[78:48.77]I need macaroni.
[78:49.51]And then you're going to get macaroni here.
[78:50.93]You're going to get two macaronis.
[78:52.65]Just hold on here.
[78:54.41]I got dirty plates.
[78:55.65]I'm going to wash the plates while you cook.
[78:59.27]Sounds like a good plan.
[79:01.61]And I'm going to throw the plates back at you.
[79:04.86]I can't.
[79:05.18]I have to put these plates back there.
[79:07.24]You have to put them on the table.
[79:09.32]Oh my lord, really?
[79:13.34]Okay, coming back.
[79:13.84]Alright, and now I need macaroni meat.
[79:16.04]Macaroni meat.
[79:18.16]Chop the meat.
[79:19.25]I figured it out by now.
[79:20.63]What do you think I am?
[79:21.21]Some kind of buffoon?
[79:24.13]You know, you're older.
[79:25.91]We're about to lose both of these.
[79:30.23]Well, they are on the tables.
[79:33.19]Come on, we got like five seconds.
[79:35.29]Hurry up and float over here.
[79:37.11]Shitty gimmick restaurant.
[79:40.88]That's when you can Jack up the prices.
[79:43.40]We're making bank on all these guys.
[79:44.86]Oh, this is about to disappear.
[79:47.59]Hurry.
[79:49.43]That was a zigzag.
[79:50.27]You shouldn't have done the zigzag.
[79:51.65]I didn't think I picked it up.
[79:53.21]Whatever.
[79:55.19]Just whatever.
[79:56.05]Alright.
[79:56.25]What else do you need?
[79:57.54]I need all the plates.
[79:59.84]They're coming back.
[80:00.70]And I also need a chopped mushroom.
[80:04.08]Hold on.
[80:04.82]I need another macaroni.
[80:05.76]Alright.
[80:06.62]Chopped mushroom.
[80:09.80]You sure you need that still?
[80:16.02]This food's been on the floor.
[80:17.12]I know, right?
[80:19.94]I forgot to take the plate.
[80:20.80]That's my bad.
[80:21.98]That's okay.
[80:22.36]Why are you throwing these back?
[80:27.26]I don't know.
[80:28.66]I don't put them on the table.
[80:30.12]Well, do you have anything else ready?
[80:32.46]Yeah, I got a macaroni mushroom right here.
[80:35.51]We're not going to make it.
[80:37.13]We're not going to make this one.
[80:38.71]I do have a knife, I know.
[80:40.89]But I also have too many jobs for that knife.
[80:44.05]Woo!
[80:45.37]Redo.
[80:45.97]That's a redo.
[80:46.63]Yeah, that's a redo.
[80:49.91]That's a redo.
[80:51.47]First one star, that's embarrassing.
[80:53.69]We can't live with that.
[80:58.22]It's alright, we'll get her here.
[81:05.64]Suckers.
[81:06.16]We only need 300 for two stars.
[81:15.28]Okay, so macaroni coming over here.
[81:17.70]Alright.
[81:19.00]Two macaronis.
[81:19.66]Let's get three stars on this one.
[81:20.86]Alright, so we need mushroom coming up.
[81:22.38]Ooh, three.
[81:23.18]Ooh.
[81:24.30]Mushroom and meat.
[81:25.28]Yep.
[81:28.90]Mushroom and meat.
[81:29.96]Then another macaroni meat.
[81:33.10]Macaroni meat.
[81:42.46]Okay, anything else?
[81:43.32]Are you good for now?
[81:45.55]Oh, I'm good.
[81:49.23]Looks like I got a mushroom.
[81:50.27]Here comes the orders.
[81:51.87]Here comes a chopped mushroom.
[81:54.15]And another macaroni.
[81:55.45]Just for you.
[81:56.86]Thank you.
[81:57.66]You're so sweet.
[81:58.58]I'm gonna do these.
[81:59.96]Wash the dishes.
[82:01.18]Send them back.
[82:03.54]I like this plan.
[82:05.38]Alright, now we need, uh... Two macaroni meats.
[82:10.53]We got one coming up, so just one macaroni meat.
[82:13.41]One order's already ready.
[82:15.61]Macaroni.
[82:17.89]I will need dos macaronis.
[82:19.85]Okay, you need another macaroni after that one.
[82:21.35]You got it.
[82:24.01]I need another meat.
[82:24.80]Alright, we have the first... We do need... Look, I don't know.
[82:29.90]Just wait until you turn those in and you do the orders.
[82:32.08]Because I can't... How do I throw this in the trash?
[82:35.04]Like this.
[82:35.34]Alright, two orders up coming your way.
[82:38.74]I made a bunch of seagulls.
[82:39.60]More important than the dishes.
[82:45.06]Alright, this should be enough.
[82:48.00]See if I can get a couple over there.
[82:49.18]I gotta get at least one over there.
[82:51.56]Alright, now I need just plates.
[82:55.47]All I could get was one at the time.
[82:56.89]I'm sorry.
[82:58.21]I need more than one plate, please.
[83:00.31]I'm working on it.
[83:01.01]Okay, order coming back.
[83:06.91]Okay, take a look.
[83:08.09]What else do you need?
[83:10.24]Okay, I need a meat.
[83:12.12]No, I need two mushrooms, a meat, and a mushroom.
[83:14.48]Okay.
[83:14.92]Oh, don't say that, right?
[83:15.98]I throw it.
[83:19.16]Two mushrooms.
[83:20.06]Plates.
[83:20.84]Lots of plates.
[83:22.84]Fantastic.
[83:23.56]Okay, now you need... Now I need macaronis.
[83:25.60]Two macs.
[83:26.20]Two macs.
[83:27.36]Two macs.
[83:28.16]Just say... Just do three word... Three set... Like abbreviate it.
[83:31.07]Like mac mush meat.
[83:32.99]You know what I mean?
[83:35.13]Well, I need... I need two mush.
[83:36.57]Two mush.
[83:37.85]Chopped, please.
[83:38.57]You can throw one to me, though.
[83:40.03]Okay.
[83:41.37]I freaked out.
[83:41.85]I just threw it over to a seagull.
[83:42.83]Okay, here.
[83:48.61]Okay.
[83:49.59]I didn't take the plates.
[83:50.23]You didn't even take the goddamn plates.
[83:51.55]Well, the food's not ready anyway.
[83:53.44]It's alright.
[83:53.76]You're going to get a fourth plate.
[83:55.04]So you have all the plates you need.
[83:58.60]Okay.
[83:59.20]That's going to prove challenging.
[84:01.54]These people are probably like, there ain't no food on here.
[84:04.98]We're a pretend restaurant.
[84:06.15]Just lick the plates.
[84:07.17]You just have to pretend to eat.
[84:09.97]Alright.
[84:10.53]Hang on.
[84:11.15]We need those two mac and mush right now.
[84:15.61]Mac and mush.
[84:16.17]I can't.
[84:16.35]Mac and mush.
[84:16.89]Mac and mush.
[84:24.25]Got it.
[84:25.35]Can I do it in time?
[84:31.12]Of course I can.
[84:31.90]No missed orders here.
[84:33.22]No penalty.
[84:33.84]The reflexes of a kitty.
[84:36.02]Alright, so you need me?
[84:38.20]What's next?
[84:39.06]We got six seconds, so.
[84:40.52]Hey, we got four stars.
[84:42.34]Wait, what if I just serve somebody this?
[84:43.30]Will it be points?
[84:46.82]Wait, I think that's four stars, man.
[84:48.84]Yep.
[84:49.24]Ooh.
[84:52.22]No failed orders.
[84:53.69]That's how you start from rags to riches.
[84:57.43]That's a Kitchen Nightmare success story.
[85:02.35]Gordon Ramsay didn't kill my restaurant.
[85:07.14]Nice, dude.
[85:07.98]Nice.
[85:08.32]Yeah, thanks, guys.
[85:09.36]We really tried.
[85:10.68]We're going for a full achievement run, so we're just trying to get all the steam achievements right now.
[85:14.67]So what does the top right mean?
[85:15.97]That's the total stars we've accumulated, right?
[85:17.79]Those are total stars.
[85:19.20]And if I remember correctly, you do come across levels that you have to have certain stars.
[85:26.04]Like, you have to have ten stars to do this level.
[85:28.16]Yeah, and then you unlock the loot boxes, and it's seven stars per loot box.
[85:32.08]That's where the other characters are for the skins.
[85:33.98]That's unless you buy in.
[85:35.06]So, like, if you want, you can put your credit card in there and then just go ahead and buy stars.
[85:39.55]Yeah, but it's, like, $9 a skin, though.
[85:41.33]That's, like, kind of fucked up.
[85:45.14]But as long as you log in seven days in a row, you will get the daily bonus.
[85:48.04]Oh, okay.
[85:50.18]So that's enough to buy.
[85:51.56]So logging in for seven days in a row every day is enough currency to buy like the default worst possible thing out of the box, right?
[85:59.54]Yeah.
[85:59.78]So also everyone watching the stream right now, if you just use a referral code.
[86:05.28]That's true.
[86:09.17]Hold on, we got a new shit here going on.
[86:11.19]Yeah, I didn't read the thing.
[86:13.07]I saw tortillas.
[86:14.19]Do we have to do like a tortilla press?
[86:17.00]No.
[86:18.14]Restart.
[86:18.80]We appear to be in a gold mine.
[86:22.08]No, that's not real.
[86:22.96]This game is just, you buy it and you play it forever.
[86:25.10]There's no, no.
[86:26.08]We're making a referenced topical joke.
[86:28.24]Someone out there believed all of that.
[86:29.84]You need to restart this so we can start fresh.
[86:33.60]Subway, start fresh.
[86:34.96]Like they're gonna have to do after all the bullshit they've pulled.
[86:41.55]Take a tortilla, add cooked rice, then add fried chicken, meat, or chocolate cubes.
[86:49.94]What do you mean not funny?
[86:52.18]Subway eat fresh, Subway start fresh, because they're closing thousands of restaurants.
[86:56.02]Because it's a joke.
[86:57.76]Come on, man.
[86:58.66]I deserve at least plus... No, I forgot.
[87:01.15]What are we doing?
[87:02.15]I need rice.
[87:05.31]Ah, we have to press the tortillas.
[87:06.97]So you do have to press the tortillas.
[87:10.38]So I got mushroom.
[87:11.28]How do you press the tortilla?
[87:13.16]No, you don't.
[87:13.50]You don't have to do that.
[87:14.14]You don't press the tortilla.
[87:15.34]No, no.
[87:15.72]You just fill it.
[87:17.36]Why are you throwing it back over here?
[87:19.20]Restart it.
[87:20.42]Restart again.
[87:22.68]Alright.
[87:24.96]Done.
[87:25.06]I can't believe I tuned in for that joke and then tuned out.
[87:32.62]Wait, the timer isn't even going?
[87:35.52]The timer wasn't even counting.
[87:38.24]Hold on.
[87:38.61]Why was the timer not counting down?
[87:41.51]Oh, I was going to read that again.
[87:43.39]Is the timer not counting?
[87:44.39]It's not, for some reason.
[87:45.55]Okay, let's take it to our advantage.
[87:47.99]So we need tortilla.
[87:49.41]In.
[87:49.71]Two tortillas.
[87:51.27]Plated.
[87:51.57]Okay, I have rice.
[87:54.44]You can throw the rice over here.
[87:56.88]Wow!
[87:58.36]Do it again.
[87:59.70]Come on, you can do it.
[88:00.24]That's a bit far.
[88:02.20]Okay, now we need mushroom.
[88:03.54]Chopped mushroom.
[88:04.42]It's on your side.
[88:05.66]You have the mushrooms.
[88:06.90]You need meat.
[88:08.42]Meat is on your side.
[88:11.24]Oh, I have to cook it.
[88:12.06]Yes, you do.
[88:14.84]So give it back.
[88:15.94]Wait, what?
[88:18.33]Okay, we got rice in both tortillas.
[88:22.01]That's all we need so far.
[88:23.05]I just need those two meats.
[88:24.44]Okay.
[88:25.49]How are we going... Well, one of them is mushroom, but that is a meat substitute in some places.
[88:29.55]Yes, if you're a vegetarian, that's a meat substitute.
[88:31.95]So, sort of.
[88:32.97]You have to pass it.
[88:34.19]We're going to have to... Oh, my God, what have you done?
[88:35.94]There's no throwing the pans.
[88:37.28]That's dangerous.
[88:38.10]Okay, just... You take this.
[88:40.48]Thank you.
[88:40.92]You take it.
[88:41.98]That's such a convoluted way to do what we just did.
[88:44.34]Alright, here we go.
[88:45.48]First, what is it?
[88:49.12]I need a tortilla, rice.
[88:52.17]Thank you.
[88:54.27]Another plate.
[88:55.35]Oh, so close.
[88:56.61]You almost got it.
[88:57.91]You gotta toss the plates to me or I gotta come around if you can.
[89:01.09]So I got rice in this one.
[89:06.57]Need another tortilla.
[89:08.33]Alright, I am riced up here.
[89:11.84]So now I need meat and I need mushrooms.
[89:14.36]And that's it.
[89:18.62]Why can't you throw pants?
[89:19.86]I wanna throw pants.
[89:23.87]Okay, this one is done.
[89:24.83]Alright, so we need... There comes the mushroom.
[89:27.71]I need a cooked mushroom.
[89:32.63]And you will have one.
[89:34.05]I'll grab a plate.
[89:35.87]Well, I already put it on a plate for you.
[89:38.79]Because you blocked me.
[89:41.33]See you next time.
[89:42.13]Thanks for playing.
[89:43.71]Okay, so there's the mushroom.
[89:46.77]It goes in here.
[89:51.19]Take this with you.
[89:55.56]It's cooked meat.
[89:57.04]There was no throwing in the first game, right?
[89:59.00]I don't know.
[89:59.34]I don't think so.
[90:00.46]I need rice, which is here.
[90:02.76]I need mushrooms.
[90:03.86]Oh, it's there.
[90:05.58]Are the mushrooms ready?
[90:08.65]Oh, I don't have any mushrooms.
[90:10.61]Oh, fuck.
[90:11.49]Okay, hold on.
[90:15.75]Okay, I got this one is ready.
[90:18.43]Now I just need mushrooms in that one.
[90:21.15]I'm just going to throw you a few mushrooms here.
[90:23.71]I've got two, but thank you.
[90:25.05]I've got four.
[90:25.97]You're going to need them eventually.
[90:27.88]That's all we need.
[90:28.36]We need three mushrooms.
[90:29.82]Mushroom, mushroom, mushroom.
[90:31.74]And I'll take this plate.
[90:33.08]Hey, was that a meme?
[90:35.28]No, it was not.
[90:37.62]Focus, focus.
[90:38.70]Is this cooked?
[90:42.58]That mushroom is cooked.
[90:43.70]I'm going to do the dish.
[90:45.37]Yeah, it is cooked.
[90:48.37]Alright, I need another mushroom.
[90:50.17]I need rice, too.
[90:50.75]You know I'm busy here.
[90:51.93]Alright, I'll get the rice.
[90:52.69]Just you focus, focus, focus, focus, focus.
[90:54.55]Right here, right here.
[90:55.15]Mushrooms.
[90:55.38]I need that mushroom.
[90:58.20]Good, take the plate back.
[90:59.54]I'll take some rice.
[91:01.24]Start cooking again.
[91:02.16]Where'd the other one go?
[91:03.22]It's on your side.
[91:03.64]I need tortilla.
[91:04.72]I need rice.
[91:06.90]Come on, man.
[91:07.44]We can't miss any orders.
[91:08.20]Look.
[91:10.24]Will you get in there?
[91:13.59]They're both there.
[91:14.19]There's two rice right there.
[91:15.29]Good.
[91:15.83]Okay, now I need a plate.
[91:18.85]We have any plates?
[91:20.45]Right there.
[91:20.78]Thank you.
[91:24.28]Another one.
[91:24.98]I need a mushroom.
[91:25.74]What's next?
[91:27.12]Mushroom and meat.
[91:29.22]Give me one minute.
[91:32.42]We got a minute 15.
[91:33.18]This is not good, man.
[91:36.08]We're going to lose some orders.
[91:36.90]Uh-oh.
[91:40.72]Sorry.
[91:40.90]There you go.
[91:45.28]Mushroom plate.
[91:46.54]But...
[91:48.72]Oh shit, it's burning!
[91:52.24]Okay, that's good.
[91:53.22]Meat plate?
[91:54.42]Meat plate, good.
[91:58.98]It's too much.
[92:00.11]For two people.
[92:01.25]I told you we should've just spent some more money on hiring some help.
[92:03.89]Okay.
[92:04.55]Is this done?
[92:05.25]That's done?
[92:06.13]I need, uh, mushroom?
[92:09.25]I need mushroom.
[92:13.49]Don't put it back on the burner, you fucking dumbass.
[92:17.85]Uh-oh.
[92:18.45]I think the mines are about to collapse.
[92:19.97]We can get one more here.
[92:21.29]I just need meat or mushroom.
[92:22.75]Anything.
[92:24.41]We've got to come to the mushroom.
[92:25.91]The mushroom's cooking.
[92:26.59]It's almost done.
[92:32.39]She's taking the... No!
[92:33.35]What happened?
[92:33.97]What happened?
[92:35.15]Why did that happen?
[92:36.15]Put it on the plate.
[92:36.81]No, don't throw it over there.
[92:39.42]Don't... Got it.
[92:42.62]Save.
[92:43.60]Save.
[92:44.18]We got 800 points.
[92:45.64]We did pretty good, I think.
[92:48.74]Is this game two-player only?
[92:49.74]No, you can actually do four players.
[92:51.46]We killed that guy.
[92:52.16]But it scales the difficulty.
[92:54.46]So you have to get more points the more people that play.
[92:56.56]Yeah, we killed that.
[92:59.80]Speedrunners will use that strategy.
[93:01.48]Do you remember you're a thick fry and a great guy?
[93:07.11]I don't get it.
[93:14.27]Do you get that?
[93:14.73]A thick fry and a great guy?
[93:16.01]What's that?
[93:17.22]I don't know.
[93:17.58]You're mostly potato.
[93:19.88]Yeah, but what's the joke there?
[93:21.41]There's a reference there?
[93:23.35]I don't know.
[93:23.67]I think people just like saying one of those words.
[93:27.27]Are you sure?
[93:28.51]At every opportunity.
[93:32.81]I don't know which one it is, though.
[93:34.00]I'm going to turn my fan on.
[93:36.24]What was I thinking?
[93:39.60]I don't know.
[93:40.40]They just like saying Fry.
[93:42.98]No?
[93:43.76]Fry like from Futurama?
[93:45.12]Did Fry say that in an episode?
[93:54.16]Sometimes you have to decipher what they mean.
[93:56.90]Yo, that chick is fry.
[93:59.08]Alright, so this is complicated.
[94:01.54]We need to do tortillas.
[94:04.27]So you got to be on food.
[94:06.87]I'm going to be cooking duty.
[94:07.67]You're on food duty.
[94:08.45]The crystal, can we just quit and go into the mines and start trying to get the crystals?
[94:13.15]Uh-oh.
[94:13.61]This is how we switch it up.
[94:15.35]This is how you switch up the game here.
[94:16.61]Uh-oh.
[94:23.79]Alright, restart.
[94:29.33]You ready?
[94:29.65]We need only 460 points.
[94:32.01]That's very doable.
[94:32.79]Alright, you ready?
[94:36.29]Tortilla, I'll help you.
[94:38.05]I'm going to grab chicken.
[94:40.46]Watch this.
[94:43.92]Why can't that just go on the plate?
[94:45.60]Chicken cooking.
[94:46.16]Hold on, start over.
[94:46.86]No, no, no, you don't need to.
[94:50.70]It has to be perfect.
[94:51.76]We only need 460 points.
[94:52.92]We can do it easily.
[94:57.55]We're going to keep re-rolling until we get the perfect allocate.
[95:01.45]Don't you dare restart for that.
[95:02.57]You're going to live with that mistake.
[95:08.02]I got the meat.
[95:10.32]I need rice.
[95:11.60]I'll handle this.
[95:12.10]You handle the rice.
[95:13.48]Okay.
[95:13.92]Can you handle the rice?
[95:15.56]There's rice cooking right now.
[95:16.84]Good.
[95:17.90]As much as can be cooking.
[95:24.89]Okay.
[95:26.25]That's good.
[95:27.43]I need... We got tortilla here.
[95:29.84]There we go.
[95:30.52]I need some rice.
[95:32.34]Turn it on your side.
[95:33.40]We got the rice.
[95:34.38]Just... Yeah, okay.
[95:36.38]I need... Is that rice done?
[95:38.06]That rice is done.
[95:39.06]Okay.
[95:39.78]Getting two more.
[95:40.44]Alright, so that's good.
[95:41.99]I need some chicken.
[95:43.05]Oh, I need two chickens.
[95:46.69]I'll grab yellow.
[95:49.95]You don't... You got to master that art of throwing it right.
[95:52.35]You just have to, don't you?
[95:54.89]It seems mandatory, yeah.
[95:56.69]Here's some rice.
[96:00.16]I got a lot of that.
[96:01.14]Thank you.
[96:01.52]I just need... We got cooked rice here.
[96:04.34]See you later.
[96:05.60]Gotta live with that mistake.
[96:07.36]Sorry, that's the only mistake I've made the whole game, so... Where's it going?
[96:14.51]Okay, now we need a tortilla.
[96:18.43]Doing the dishes.
[96:19.87]That's good.
[96:20.45]Alright.
[96:21.37]Cook this chicken.
[96:23.58]Tortilla on the plate.
[96:24.35]Do you have any other ingredients for me?
[96:27.43]I got cooked rice on the middle.
[96:28.73]Alright, throw that cooked rice.
[96:34.37]Then I will be stealing this back.
[96:36.18]Just don't drop it in the middle.
[96:37.58]Anywhere.
[96:37.94]It's fine.
[96:40.40]Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken.
[96:42.00]Okay.
[96:45.92]Alright, we need beef.
[96:47.69]Double beef, double chicken.
[96:49.37]Just do double beef.
[96:55.55]I just missed completely.
[96:56.85]It's alright.
[96:59.46]You just hit me in the fucking face with a chicken leg.
[97:03.90]I feel like this is what people do when they work at a food restaurant, though.
[97:06.46]Don't you think so?
[97:07.42]You're just like, ah, ah, ah.
[97:09.32]Whip him with it.
[97:09.72]Hit him with a drumstick in his head.
[97:10.95]Alright.
[97:14.69]We have any plates?
[97:18.51]Who cares about sanitation right now?
[97:20.73]The plates are all dirty.
[97:21.43]Alright.
[97:22.92]They're all, every single one's dirty.
[97:24.71]Oh, fuck.
[97:26.41]Wait, no, they're over here.
[97:27.61]Okay, I just need, I need plates.
[97:29.37]Alright, I'm gonna load these up.
[97:32.13]Tortilla right there.
[97:32.95]We got, here comes the meat.
[97:33.81]You ready?
[97:36.47]We just missed an order.
[97:37.41]It's okay.
[97:37.87]I need rice on that one.
[97:41.81]There's meat on this one.
[97:43.80]Chicken on the next one.
[97:44.54]Okay, we got rice all aboard.
[97:48.48]Okay.
[97:49.98]Rice.
[97:50.54]These ones are ready.
[97:52.02]Get it in there.
[97:53.66]Okay, double rice cooking.
[97:54.94]I need a tortilla on this one.
[97:56.14]I need a tortilla on that one.
[97:56.96]I just need a tortilla on this one.
[98:03.51]Tortilla and rice.
[98:04.73]Do you have any cooked rice?
[98:05.67]Yes, you do.
[98:06.05]Right here.
[98:06.39]Got it.
[98:07.77]That tortilla's lost.
[98:08.99]Tortilla on that one.
[98:13.40]Got it.
[98:13.70]Okay, we have three stars.
[98:15.42]We did it.
[98:15.86]We're good.
[98:16.10]We have to restart.
[98:17.62]Did we not get gold?
[98:18.66]No, no, no.
[98:18.88]I said we have three stars, not restart.
[98:22.21]Are you sure you didn't say restart?
[98:23.89]No, we have three stars.
[98:26.41]It's 460 for three stars or 420.
[98:27.55]See?
[98:31.98]See?
[98:33.12]Done.
[98:36.04]Did I say restart?
[98:37.26]No, we have three stars.
[98:39.12]Sounds very similar.
[98:49.65]I did not say restart.
[98:52.08]We have restart.
[98:53.24]You definitely said restart.
[98:55.22]Somebody clip it.
[98:56.00]I want to hear it.
[98:57.58]We have restart.
[98:59.26]No, we have restart.
[98:59.86]What if I did restart?
[99:01.62]You didn't.
[99:03.76]But what if we restarted after getting three stars right before the end of the mission?
[99:07.65]How angry would you be?
[99:08.57]Scale of one to ten.
[99:09.51]I'd be like, well, that's more video game that we have to play.
[99:15.07]We have restart.
[99:16.37]Remember the Kevin joke.
[99:17.87]Omega lull.
[99:19.11]Alright, we got to actually make the bun out of cheese.
[99:23.06]Is it cheese bun?
[99:26.92]Good one.
[99:29.18]Combined bun, fried patty, chopped lettuce, tomato, cheese together on a plate.
[99:32.74]This was, oh boy.
[99:34.82]Are you sure you wanted to, okay, do you know how to make a cheeseburger?
[99:38.18]Yes.
[99:40.34]You do?
[99:40.78]I can't come over there.
[99:41.50]What's the first step?
[99:42.04]Yes, I can.
[99:43.52]First step is cheese.
[99:46.79]I'll get you that cheese.
[99:48.61]Okay.
[99:49.05]Thank you.
[99:49.37]I have to chop the cheese up.
[99:50.63]Chop it up the cheese.
[99:53.95]Easy on the cheese.
[99:54.51]Nobody even wants this cheese.
[99:56.26]This is too much cheese.
[99:57.08]Alright.
[99:57.92]We need patties.
[99:59.02]The first step to a cheeseburger is cheese, I was told.
[100:00.88]No, the first step is not cheese.
[100:02.42]Oh, my God.
[100:03.14]I'm going to get stuck over here.
[100:06.44]No one even wants this.
[100:07.40]There's one guy who wants cheese.
[100:08.46]Why are you chopping it up?
[100:09.06]Let me chop this instead.
[100:10.20]I'm going to put this over here.
[100:12.59]That burger already has cheese on it.
[100:17.75]I'm useless over here right now.
[100:19.33]Well, you can mine the food.
[100:20.69]Make sure it doesn't burn.
[100:21.49]I'm gonna just put cheese on a bunch of these buns.
[100:23.89]You understand?
[100:24.29]Look, no, don't!
[100:25.11]They don't want... Only one of them wants cheese.
[100:27.04]Eventually, we're preparing.
[100:28.06]That patty's cooked.
[100:30.14]Cheese.
[100:30.78]Burger.
[100:31.94]Hand it in.
[100:33.02]Okay, I got another cheeseburger.
[100:34.82]Nobody wants cheeseburgers, he says.
[100:37.00]Put it down.
[100:37.30]Alright, this one's just patty and bun, and look at this.
[100:41.56]We're on top of the order.
[100:42.80]So huge.
[100:43.22]We are on top.
[100:44.56]This is fucking huge, man.
[100:47.03]Oh, there's no thing on there.
[100:48.23]Okay.
[100:50.99]Uh, we... You have one of the skillets on your side.
[100:57.20]I don't know how it got there, but chop it up and serve that metal plastic.
[101:01.56]Put it back down.
[101:03.12]What happened?
[101:03.56]Now we're... Uh-oh.
[101:05.00]Uh-oh.
[101:05.31]This is not good.
[101:06.55]Uh-oh.
[101:07.77]Put it on there.
[101:10.23]I mean, we can't serve it.
[101:11.31]Well, actually... Just get ready.
[101:12.75]Just get ready.
[101:13.09]You can chop it up.
[101:14.81]You can't throw these.
[101:17.11]Cheese on either the plate plates are all dirty We were so on top of this too.
[101:21.83]I'll take care of this and I'm gonna clean the dishes you take care of the rest of stuff These are the weights of the way that we can move Okay, what's next It's called washing dishes what we can do it at the same time twice as fast teamwork.
[101:40.36]Alright, I
[101:41.78]Be careful you don't fall off.
[101:43.12]Which one is done?
[101:43.60]This one?
[101:43.94]Okay, we got one here.
[101:45.70]Cheese, right?
[101:46.44]Somebody wants cheese?
[101:47.80]Patty.
[101:50.14]Patty!
[101:51.76]No, I mean bun!
[101:54.79]You kept saying Patty.
[101:58.91]Why can I not put this on the plate?
[102:00.31]Alright, I'm on this side now.
[102:02.11]Just turn it in.
[102:04.74]Alright, we gotta get meat going here.
[102:06.02]Big time.
[102:10.57]Is this one done?
[102:11.71]Okay, this one's done.
[102:12.43]I don't know.
[102:13.25]You're the chef.
[102:14.28]If I'm the chef right now, then you've got to listen to me.
[102:17.50]Where's the other burner?
[102:19.80]It's right there.
[102:21.78]As soon as I pick this patty up off the floor.

[103:18.98]This one's right in front of me.
[103:19.72]Take it.
[103:19.94]You got it.
[103:22.48]Okay.
[103:23.26]Same thing.
[103:24.33]Take a... Oh, fuck.

[103:26.87]You stay on that side.
[103:28.43]Take this one.
[103:29.61]That's delivered right now.
[103:31.55]Alright.
[103:31.87]You need some more cheese over there.
[103:33.33]All those dishes need to go to sink.
[103:36.07]I got cheese already cut up.
[103:38.03]We need patties on the grill.
[103:41.30]We have no meat cooking in the hamburger kitchen.
[103:43.34]Hold on.
[103:44.56]I'm going to get plates first.
[103:45.40]Okay, meat.
[103:49.62]I'm going to go one, two, three with the meat here.
[103:52.78]You got to chop this up.
[103:53.62]You got to chop it up.
[103:58.76]We got one too many, and no one's on that side.
[104:02.26]I'm going to throw it over there when we're ready.
[104:06.27]I think we can get at least one or two more here.
[104:07.71]I think we can get at least a couple more, yeah.
[104:09.95]You got to cook it.
[104:12.65]We're just doing the bulk.
[104:13.49]We're doing all cheese.
[104:14.25]Get the plate.
[104:14.83]Okay.
[104:15.75]Plate it up.
[104:20.53]Alright.
[104:20.75]Come on.
[104:21.01]Turn.
[104:21.27]When you see buns on two of them.
[104:23.03]Both.
[104:23.35]Do both cheese.
[104:24.25]It's more money.
[104:28.17]Five seconds.
[104:28.79]Take it.
[104:30.30]Three seconds.
[104:31.02]Take it.
[104:32.38]Oh, wait.
[104:32.72]Just so good.
[104:33.56]Just no one can compare to us.
[104:35.10]Alright.
[104:38.24]That's a two star.
[104:39.40]Oh, well.
[104:44.91]Oh well.
[104:45.83]Close.
[104:46.07]Good enough.
[104:46.65]Good enough.
[104:47.03]Good enough.
[104:48.83]Nobody can compare to the two star rating.
[104:55.50]No, you only restart on a one star.
[104:56.74]You don't restart on a two star.
[104:59.80]That's correct.
[105:00.32]You do only restart on a one star.
[105:02.82]Yeah, we don't have to restart now.
[105:04.74]Two star is just a judgment of our character that we have to live with.
[105:07.80]A three star player can compare.
[105:13.27]I mean, we got three stars like that's on this one.
[105:17.54]On this one.
[105:19.78]On that one.
[105:21.14]That's three in a row right there.
[105:23.18]There's a two star.
[105:23.96]Three star.
[105:26.58]Do we go back to the castle now?
[105:29.42]Three star or unsubbed.
[105:30.68]Three star or riot.
[105:32.42]Well, yeah, we got two stars before and nobody said anything.
[105:36.59]So I'm calling your bluff.
[105:38.69]Back to the throne.
[105:41.39]You got to be consistent.
[105:45.33]You can't just throw that criticism out of nowhere.
[105:49.08]Kevin didn't make it.
[105:52.52]Kevin died.
[105:54.92]He's right there.
[105:55.50]Oh.
[105:56.86]Kevin doesn't like his food, by the way, in a game about chefs.
[106:01.71]The unbred get hungrier.
[106:07.19]Do you dare?
[106:08.49]Will you go up into space for the onion kingdom?
[106:12.83]Uh-oh.
[106:15.92]Do you think underneath that hat are hats that's the way their head is shaped?
[106:23.16]Hold on, what?
[106:25.90]No, you just have a hair in your bun.
[106:30.02]You just have hair in your bun.
[106:32.66]There's hair in my bun.
[106:42.49]You guys are too easy over here.
[106:46.60]Oh, you just killed him.
[106:47.42]You're killing these guys.
[106:49.25]That's okay.
[106:49.83]They're zombies.
[106:50.57]Oh my god!
[106:51.81]We're in Zombieland 2 with all your favorite characters from Zombieland 1.
[106:56.03]You just run over the zombies.
[106:57.17]It's a real easy lap.
[106:57.81]Oh my god.
[106:58.15]What the fuck?
[107:00.89]You can run over the zombies?
[107:02.33]What?
[107:04.43]That's crazy.
[107:07.50]Hey, you like that puzzle that I just solved?
[107:09.64]How do I get up here?
[107:10.95]Maybe it's the switch.
[107:12.45]I probably wouldn't have figured that out.
[107:13.77]I would have had to end the stream.
[107:15.03]I would not have figured that out.
[107:16.83]I would have been complaining about that for like 10 minutes.
[107:20.91]We're at Stonehenge now.
[107:22.89]You need 16 stars to progress here.
[107:30.59]Ooh, pizza.
[107:31.29]Prepare dough with knife and chopped cheese, tomato, and possibly some pepperoni.
[107:36.20]so we're just making pizza in the oven new recipe I love pizza okay well you're about to make it for uh Harry Potter that's true alright so we need dough tomatoes so I'm just like the tomato guy let me just chop this dough oh alright cheese the I can I can't leave from here but I have the plates over here though
[108:05.39]Alright, now put that... Wait, there's no... Oh, I thought you just put cheese and tomato sauce into the oven.
[108:09.57]No, there's dough on there.
[108:11.67]Okay, hold on.
[108:12.21]I got, like... You're kind of just locked up.
[108:14.68]So, two things.
[108:15.88]One, there's a plate on the chopping board.
[108:18.68]Two... Well, remember everything we just said.
[108:21.18]It's all about to change.
[108:22.08]So, it's going this way.
[108:24.64]Don't burn the pizza.
[108:25.38]Don't burn the pizza.
[108:26.12]Okay, pizza.
[108:26.60]Is this pizza done?
[108:28.09]That pizza is done.
[108:29.29]It looks like somebody just spilled egg yolk on that pizza.
[108:32.21]Is it done?
[108:33.93]Oh, no.
[108:34.33]What do you mean?
[108:35.69]I need a plate?
[108:37.59]There seem to be tomatoes on this.
[108:39.63]This pizza looks like shit.
[108:42.33]Okay, it's done.
[108:46.14]Cutting board.
[108:51.99]Okay, I need the chopped up cheese.
[108:53.53]I do not need to do that.
[108:54.73]Give me that.
[108:55.31]I can't touch it.
[108:55.89]It's in the air.
[108:56.63]I can't.
[108:57.11]No.
[108:57.59]I think we need to restart.
[108:58.64]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[108:59.34]Don't.
[109:00.08]Don't let it beat you.
[109:02.50]Every time something goes wrong.
[109:04.08]One minute mistake.
[109:05.06]Can I throw it in the oven?
[109:06.30]Alright, into the oven it goes.
[109:09.12]Doesn't even need to be on... No plates.
[109:11.50]Wait, does it need to be on a plate?
[109:12.86]No.
[109:13.44]Everybody wants cheese.
[109:15.74]Go get that in there too.
[109:19.16]Okay.
[109:19.54]We need a bunch of tomato.
[109:21.79]We need dough more than anything else.
[109:23.33]That's the foundation of the pizza.
[109:26.07]Well, I mean, it depends on what kind of pizza you have.
[109:30.79]Coming over this way.
[109:35.67]This is doughless pizza.
[109:37.54]I hope you don't want dough or cheese on your next pizza.
[109:40.62]What?
[109:41.70]Because you're not going to get any cheese on your next pizza.
[109:45.50]They all want it, so we're in a little bit of trouble.
[109:51.44]Okay.
[109:52.28]Chop it.
[109:53.12]Chop up that dough.
[109:57.48]Plate it.
[109:58.42]Hey!
[110:00.87]Hey!
[110:02.55]Hey, wait!
[110:08.65]What are you doing?
[110:10.13]Now we're stuck back here.
[110:24.41]Are you still here?
[110:25.51]Is he trying to tell me something?
[110:41.11]He's muted.
[110:41.75]I don't think we can ever get over here again.
[110:49.35]Oh, yes we can.
[110:50.94]Hey, what are you doing?
[110:53.23]Why did you just... Because we got stuck on the same side twice.
[110:57.17]No, but you went like silent.
[111:00.13]Yeah, I know.
[111:00.63]I was just trying to communicate with you using only the emotes to simulate joining some person randomly on the internet to see how everyone else could play the game.
[111:11.86]Don't ever do that again.
[111:12.78]I thought I lost you.
[111:16.24]I'll stay over here.
[111:18.36]Chop that cheese.
[111:21.47]Now chop that cheese.
[111:22.63]Don't ever come over here.
[111:24.07]We're going to get stuck.
[111:25.19]Now you're going to take that PZ.
[111:32.86]Alright, you stay.
[111:36.52]Now we got this.
[111:38.14]Just need some cheese on this one.
[111:39.16]Put that middle pizza in the oven.
[111:40.70]I will.
[111:41.26]I'm going to do them both at the same time so we can calculate.
[111:43.45]One, two.
[111:44.85]They're both going to be ready at the exact same time.
[111:47.45]Look, we're going to streamline this process.
[111:49.41]Only dough first.
[111:51.06]Move that.
[111:54.24]Okay, I'll deliver these both.
[111:55.29]Freddy, watch this.
[111:56.45]We need a plate.
[111:59.95]Pizza ready for the oven.
[112:00.83]Alright, we're going to be on top of it.
[112:06.03]Middle pizza in the... Middle pizza, I'll put it in the oven.
[112:08.86]I'm going to get another tomato.
[112:10.78]There's a plate in case you lose it.
[112:13.86]Chopping up the cheese.
[112:16.16]Ding dong.
[112:17.82]We need three tomatoes.
[112:20.76]There's one.
[112:22.73]There's two.
[112:23.75]That's cool.
[112:24.15]You can do it together.
[112:24.77]Alright.
[112:25.05]So this is... Where are the plates?
[112:30.55]They're gone.
[112:32.98]Oh, they come up here.
[112:33.68]Where's the sink?
[112:36.04]Where's... Oh, the other way down there.
[112:37.04]Okay.
[112:37.92]Can I not... Ow.
[112:39.84]Thanks.
[112:41.78]You know, doing the dirty work here.
[112:44.45]Uh-oh.
[112:45.28]You need a plate.
[112:46.34]Oh, I just put it back in the oven.
[112:48.40]Alright, plate.
[112:49.46]Good.
[112:50.48]Delivered.
[112:52.96]Alright, um, there?
[112:54.60]Bang.
[112:55.20]Okay, I need tomato.
[112:56.13]And then... In the oven.
[113:00.91]That's already got tomato on it.
[113:02.91]Bottom pizza in oven.
[113:04.15]Oh my fuck.
[113:04.55]Okay.
[113:04.79]Okay.
[113:10.53]I tried to chop it.
[113:11.67]Alright, I need that one.
[113:13.05]That pizza's ready to go into the oven.
[113:16.15]Go get the plates upstairs.
[113:17.11]No, I go get the plates.
[113:18.07]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[113:20.17]You're gonna get locked on that side.
[113:21.19]No, I'm not.
[113:21.91]I'm here.
[113:22.89]See?
[113:23.79]Now you just take this plate and throw it in the oven.
[113:27.51]That's how you clean plates.
[113:30.67]You just throw it in the oven.
[113:35.25]Here, take that, dickhead.
[113:39.05]I don't want this.
[113:40.19]Just put it on the pizza.
[113:41.27]Those are three doughs.
[113:42.63]They go on the pizza.
[113:44.21]Oh, yeah.
[113:46.43]I like preaching.
[113:51.73]The pizza's a done pizza in the top left.
[113:55.84]It's all falling apart.
[113:57.68]Alright, give me a plate.
[113:59.20]Put a plate on.
[114:03.22]That goes up to the top.
[114:04.59]That's where the lovely people eat.
[114:06.91]Here, you need to wash this.
[114:08.17]Quick.
[114:09.19]You wash it.
[114:09.69]You put it on your side.
[114:10.55]You gotta watch this YouTube video real quick.
[114:11.95]Put this in the oven.
[114:13.11]Top one in the oven.
[114:20.95]I'm trying to blade the cheese.
[114:22.89]We need it.
[114:23.37]Okay.
[114:24.35]I'm gonna fucking eat this plate.
[114:27.22]Okay, we need tomato and cheese.
[114:28.70]I'm gonna block it with my body.
[114:32.03]Oh, fuck.
[114:32.53]Okay, you take that.
[114:36.46]That plate just has cheese on it only.
[114:38.64]It's alright, because it's prepared for later.
[114:40.42]A ton of tomatoes.
[114:45.48]We got times four tips, man.
[114:46.88]Just get it in there.
[114:48.04]I'm trying.
[114:49.38]Times four tip.
[114:51.72]Tomato, here.
[114:53.82]Good.
[114:54.64]That tomato is now gone forever.
[114:57.04]Well, get it loaded up.
[114:59.42]I can't do anything else over here.
[115:01.31]Okay, well, we need dough for the pizzas.
[115:02.72]Alright, I'm going to go wash the dishes.
[115:03.94]So get the tomatoes off of the cutting board.
[115:06.56]We have 28 seconds.
[115:07.30]I'm going to go wash the dish.
[115:14.21]Oven pizza, oven pizza.
[115:15.45]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[115:17.13]In the middle one in the oven.
[115:20.89]Anything else?
[115:22.69]I think that's all we got time.
[115:23.61]Good.
[115:24.79]Come on.
[115:25.03]This last one, you can get it.
[115:27.19]Can I cook it faster?
[115:29.09]I stare at something and I press the button.
[115:30.31]No, you can't cook it.
[115:32.00]Go get the plate.
[115:34.22]Oh, come on.
[115:34.70]That was extra three seconds.
[115:35.92]Went too fast.
[115:43.18]Two star.
[115:46.23]Oh, I'm not redoing it.
[115:48.61]No.
[115:50.38]Not yet.
[115:51.56]New chef with the Poseidon tattoo.
[115:54.64]Really?
[116:00.88]Disappointed.
[116:01.46]Two-star streamer.
[116:04.89]Look, we're just trying to be relatable.
[116:06.61]We're just trying to play and win.
[116:09.01]As long as you pass, that's all that matters in life.
[116:12.93]Yeah.
[116:13.49]If you and I both had math degrees, Etalyx, right?
[116:17.57]We don't need to take honors classes.
[116:19.11]No.
[116:20.24]We're in the same math classes, me and Etalyx.
[116:23.40]I get a D- on every single exam, and he gets an A- on every single exam.
[116:29.50]We're both gonna get the same degree.
[116:32.72]You understand?
[116:35.88]It's true.
[116:37.99]Uh, is there a s- oh boy.
[116:42.63]Hogwarts just got a little bit more complicated, I think.
[116:46.37]You fail out of the class?
[116:48.11]No, you don't.
[116:48.65]If you get a D+,
[116:51.10]you will get a degree.
[116:51.84]The degree is the same degree.
[116:53.46]They don't say, oh, by the way... As long as you're not going to medical school.
[116:56.10]Well, you see, in some of these classes, he got a D+.
[117:00.18]He got a D in this class.
[117:01.52]No, you get a piece of paper that says you passed.
[117:05.26]Yeah.
[117:06.24]Ds get degrees.
[117:08.20]D- is still passing.
[117:09.82]Yes, it is.
[117:10.74]What do you mean D- is not passing?
[117:15.74]Since when is F no longer the... What are you talking about?
[117:23.36]Yeah, he goes A, B, C, D, F. F is fail.
[117:26.08]C is pass, D is a fail.
[117:27.60]D minus is not credit.
[117:30.54]I think it depends on what school you go to, but... What school are you guys going to?
[117:34.56]Well, C's are 70 and above, just in regular, like, high school.
[117:38.44]If you didn't get an F in the college that I went to, you passed.
[117:42.96]You got credit for the class.
[117:46.72]My GPA was, like, 2.8. 2.9.
[117:53.30]I passed.
[117:55.10]I got B. I had like a B minus GPA.
[117:59.06]You guys can grow up to be just like us!
[118:04.78]Isn't that exciting?
[118:06.32]Yeah, we're probably gonna restart, so I wouldn't waste... Okay.
[118:14.02]Yeah, you do understand that the guy that got A pluses in college and the guy that got B minuses in college... The guy that higher in the fucking... The guy higher in the position don't give a shit!
[118:25.92]Well, I mean, they sometimes do ask what your GPA was.
[118:28.50]Yeah, maybe if you're going to be like a surgeon.
[118:30.86]Okay, this is a teleporter.
[118:35.85]There is a teleporter.
[118:37.15]There is a teleporter.
[118:41.91]Go through it.
[118:44.68]Wouldn't want to know how well you did?
[118:46.96]Well, I would just be like, I don't know.
[118:49.24]Hold on, wait.
[118:50.18]You have this diploma here.
[118:52.90]It says you passed Business 101.
[118:55.25]And you passed Business School.
[118:57.27]You got a Bachelor's in Business.
[118:58.43]Okay.
[118:59.67]And he's like, what was your GPA?
[119:00.89]I'd be like, I don't know.
[119:03.25]It's alright.
[119:03.59]It was pretty good.
[119:05.17]What was it, though?
[119:05.77]That was 2.7.
[119:06.17]Well, how's he going to check that?
[119:09.50]I'll be checking that.
[119:11.58]I just won't give him the phone number of the school.
[119:20.82]Listen, believe me, alright?
[119:22.59]I have a piece of paper.
[119:23.85]I got a degree.
[119:24.79]It doesn't matter where.
[119:26.33]It doesn't matter how.
[119:28.05]I have a degree.
[119:29.15]Just hire me, okay?
[119:30.05]2.7 is not failing.
[119:38.72]This is going on your permanent record.
[119:40.72]What was your GPA in college?
[119:42.60]I don't know.
[119:43.02]See?
[119:43.80]Okay, see?
[119:44.24]See?
[119:45.38]Yeah, I know.
[119:47.08]It doesn't matter.
[119:47.68]I don't know.
[119:48.40]That shit don't matter.
[119:49.28]I got a degree.
[119:50.32]That shit don't matter.
[119:51.34]That's when you get... Cue the, like, get a real job comments.
[120:00.18]All that matters is that you got the degree and you did, like, alright.
[120:03.29]You don't need to memorize your GPA to...
[120:08.42]Guys, everyone's gonna... Robots are taking over every one of our jobs in the future anyway.
[120:12.99]So it don't matter.
[120:14.31]In like six months, automation's gonna take over.
[120:17.69]Alright, restart the mission.
[120:21.51]You'll be watching like an Android streamer, even.
[120:25.75]You'll be able to... I mean, they can play better.
[120:26.81]Look at chess.
[120:27.99]That's true.
[120:29.53]Look at... There's gonna be robots that can play all the games better than we can.
[120:33.17]Alright, we got plates.
[120:34.53]We gotta put buns on these plates.
[120:36.19]They're gonna replace us just like chess pros.
[120:39.98]Detroit becomes streamer.
[120:44.78]Yeah, you'll be able to make up your own streamer.
[120:46.28]You'll be able to make your own streamer.
[120:48.50]He's pacing.
[120:50.86]No, I'm trying to... You got to chop shit up, man.
[120:52.73]What are you doing?
[120:53.63]Yeah, I was patting.
[120:56.31]Oh, you pat... Alright.
[120:58.69]We're going to do this Iron Chef-like, okay?
[121:01.51]Yeah, they're going to replace the viewers.
[121:02.43]It's going to be a three-star run.
[121:03.37]The viewers are going to be androids, too.
[121:05.65]Take the buns.
[121:07.30]Put them on the plate.
[121:08.76]This is gonna be androids streaming to robot viewers.
[121:13.09]Now, take the meat.
[121:17.53]That's so funny.
[121:18.91]Ah, I did a bounce trick there.
[121:24.53]We got four skillets.
[121:26.62]And, uh, this is a hard one-player game right here, you know?
[121:30.36]Hey, I did something.
[121:32.94]That's what we need, just meat and bun.
[121:37.78]Alright, where's the delivery?
[121:38.80]We need meat and bun for number one.
[121:40.26]It's all the way to the right.
[121:40.96]Okay, so meat and bun, meat and bun.
[121:44.12]We're gonna need cheese.
[121:45.34]Okay, meat and bun is done here.
[121:52.78]Get that off the skillet.
[121:53.86]Get that off the skillet.
[121:55.92]Okay, now we need meat bun again.
[121:57.76]This one is done, right?
[122:00.86]Was that one not cooked?
[122:01.56]Did you not cook that meat?
[122:03.96]Why was that there?
[122:04.66]Uh...
[122:05.77]I think you turned in an order that nobody ordered.
[122:07.80]It was just, yeah, no one's ordering meat and buns.
[122:09.90]Oh, fuck.
[122:10.68]They're all cheese.
[122:13.82]Cheese, lettuce, cheese, lettuce, cheese, lettuce, cheese.
[122:17.86]Close, though.
[122:18.60]They did get the meat.
[122:19.44]That's the most important part of the burger.
[122:20.92]Restart, restart, restart.
[122:22.44]I thought we were doing buns and meat.
[122:25.23]Meat and bun, meat and bun, meat and bun.
[122:27.17]We only need 500 points for this.
[122:28.27]Alright, do it again.
[122:32.11]Same deal.
[122:37.50]Let's start the cooking process.
[122:41.28]I'll handle the buns.
[122:48.45]Okay, we need four patties.
[122:50.03]Yep.
[122:52.57]I'll take care of that patty.
[122:55.03]Okay, I'll start getting some lettuce.
[122:58.21]There is one meat and bun order.
[123:00.67]There is one meat and bun order.
[123:02.03]Let's just get it ready.
[123:04.74]Is this chopped lettuce?
[123:06.21]That is chopped lettuce.
[123:07.47]Okay, that one's done.
[123:08.79]We just need cheese.
[123:10.25]Okay, so these two are done.
[123:14.81]What did I do wrong?
[123:15.51]What did I do wrong?
[123:18.93]I thought you told me we didn't need that.
[123:21.61]I thought you said we didn't need that.
[123:22.87]I said all we need is cheese.
[123:25.57]Look at the clip.
[123:26.51]No, no, no, no, no.
[123:27.25]Before that.
[123:27.81]Way before that.
[123:29.15]Look at the clip.
[123:29.79]No, but before that.
[123:30.63]I'm talking about before that happened.
[123:38.56]I thought you told me we didn't need that.
[123:40.82]Listen, after tonight, it's your last night working at this establishment.
[123:45.23]Alright, here.
[123:45.73]Go, go, go, go, come on, come on, come on.
[123:46.97]Nope, nope, joking.
[123:50.89]You just almost killed me.
[123:52.41]Alright, cheese.
[123:53.85]Good, Grandma.
[123:54.87]Here it comes.
[123:55.53]Way past your time.
[123:56.97]I can't throw up the stairs.
[123:58.13]I can only throw down the stairs.
[124:01.15]Look, you have to stay in your zone.
[124:08.64]Is there a reason why you're standing still?
[124:10.52]Because I'm trying to figure out why you're going all over the whole map.
[124:13.29]I just did the thing.
[124:14.01]I went and delivered that one.
[124:15.41]Also, I'm taking the food off the burners.
[124:17.49]We also need plates.
[124:21.77]Oh, the plates are over there.
[124:22.55]Alright.
[124:25.23]I'll take all of them.
[124:26.52]No.
[124:26.80]Meat is here.
[124:30.64]There's an open-faced patty.
[124:33.41]People order those.
[124:34.75]Not at this restaurant, though.
[124:36.07]Okay, we need, uh... Okay, we got cheese only.
[124:38.69]We need a bun on that one.
[124:39.61]And then we need lettuce.
[124:41.63]Actually, we can just do bun.
[124:42.31]Okay, I'm gonna get the buns.
[124:43.23]Just get me two buns.
[124:47.63]Alright, getting lettuce.
[124:48.67]Somebody explain to me.
[124:50.55]Explain to me how that happened to me.
[124:52.66]This is correct, right?
[124:53.96]Turn it in.
[124:58.68]Go get... That one's done.
[124:59.42]That one's done.
[125:00.04]The one with just the bun.
[125:02.26]That one's done.
[125:07.77]Alright, now we need, uh, we got the lettuce already.
[125:10.31]I need to cut the cheese.
[125:11.33]Why can't I not?
[125:12.55]The game's, like, lagging on me.
[125:13.69]Uh, it's not Comcast this time.
[125:18.41]Okay, we need a bun.
[125:22.95]And a burger pat.
[125:24.21]The most important thing.
[125:25.38]We need these things on the burners.
[125:27.38]Oh, shit.
[125:36.73]At least we have plates.
[125:40.21]This one's ready, right?
[125:41.99]There's a patty on the floor.
[125:43.89]Two patties on the floor.
[125:46.14]Okay.
[125:46.50]Buns on the floor.
[125:48.16]Hold on.
[125:48.42]Wait, wait, wait.
[125:49.46]You're confusing me.
[125:52.56]Alright.
[125:54.22]We need cheese.
[125:55.26]I got stuck in the warp.
[125:56.34]We just need cheese.
[126:00.94]Okay.
[126:01.48]See you later.
[126:02.06]I just was testing something.
[126:06.21]We can get it.
[126:06.55]Almost like four stars.
[126:07.13]Come on.
[126:09.35]Cheese on this one.
[126:11.00]Put it down.
[126:13.16]I'm holding the plate.
[126:13.84]You put it on the plate.
[126:15.12]I need lettuce.
[126:18.00]You can throw the burger through there.
[126:22.64]I put it on yours.
[126:24.98]No, why did you do that?
[126:26.22]It still worked.
[126:27.76]It still worked.
[126:28.36]People ordered that one for real.
[126:30.05]And we got three stars.
[126:32.61]Did we, though?
[126:33.07]I think it was 400.
[126:35.68]ah it's 500 that was a hard one you put the lettuce on my burger yeah but it was someone ordered that there wasn't a it was not negative what did you have a 2.8 gpa in college or something look the teacher didn't tell me what was going to be on the test okay they didn't test me over any of the material we talked about before
[127:06.88]I even went to after-school care.
[127:11.55]So, I got a question.
[127:12.47]Uh-huh?
[127:14.31]If I were to just lie since I started my YouTube channel and say that I went to Yale or something, how long do you think it would take for people to figure out that it wasn't true?
[127:22.65]Well, you have a YouTube channel, so... Right.
[127:26.49]I mean, case closed.
[127:28.89]Do we have to chop this off?
[127:30.43]What's going on here?
[127:30.97]Do we have to put this in the oven or something?
[127:32.95]Oh, these are pizzas.
[127:33.94]Okay.
[127:37.03]After hearing me talk three videos.
[127:40.02]Well, it doesn't make any sense.
[127:41.24]There are a lot of, like, eccentric, expressive people that have gone to Harvard and Yale and stuff.
[127:46.72]What are you talking about?
[127:55.20]They don't say shpee.
[127:59.24]Hey, this streamer doesn't either.
[128:00.98]You're attributing, like... Oh, fuck.
[128:04.24]We can't get that pizza.
[128:09.76]I'm ready.
[128:16.52]What, you can't make jokes if you go to Harvard?
[128:19.58]You're not allowed to do that?
[128:20.82]No, you have to be very serious.
[128:26.99]The good news is that fire cannot spread to anything in that corner.
[128:29.41]But also, we can't... Might as well just restart.
[128:33.87]Yes.
[128:34.35]This stupid, like, magic world.
[128:38.52]I think this is the last level of Magic World.
[128:40.94]Harvard is in no joke.
[128:42.80]Alright, so I'll stay, like, top, you stay bottom.
[128:45.66]Okay, so I'll stay... Right side mine, left side yours.
[128:48.74]Yes, but I mean... No, no, no, because this is... You'll do all the work.
[128:52.80]That can't happen.
[128:55.04]So how do we get locked out?
[128:55.96]We get locked out horizontally and vertically.
[128:58.44]Yes.
[129:00.61]Okay, so the pizza... We're making pizza and... What kind of meat is that?
[129:05.53]That's a sausage.
[129:06.94]Oh, yeah, it's just sausage.
[129:08.42]So I got two plates here with two pizzas.
[129:12.16]What do I need to do?
[129:14.72]Take a look.
[129:15.87]Okay, you do cheese and sausage.
[129:17.23]I'll do tomato and bun.
[129:22.59]By bun, you know what I'm saying.
[129:27.43]Dough.
[129:28.53]I mean, I'm just completely blowing this right now.
[129:31.57]So, it don't matter.
[129:32.69]We got three here.
[129:33.45]I got two plates.
[129:34.11]Put it on the one with the plate.
[129:35.07]Now, that one already... Okay, we need another tomato.
[129:38.07]There you go.
[129:38.45]That one's ready.
[129:39.04]That one's ready to bake.
[129:39.74]Okay, we can only do one pizza at a time here.
[129:42.32]No, we can do two.
[129:42.70]There's one on the bottom right.
[129:43.52]Okay, there's one on the bottom right.
[129:46.88]We need cheese.
[129:48.18]Sauce on this one.
[129:50.64]So, we need just cheese, cheese, cheese.
[129:52.80]Right?
[129:53.20]Cheese, cheese, cheese.
[129:54.22]We got cheese on one.
[129:55.14]Oh, cheese, cheese, sausage, actually.
[130:00.64]couldn't walk up that I couldn't walk up those goddamn stairs oh uh this one's ready to go I'm on this side now alright I got it uh on the oven after that one it's done okay uh sausage on none of these have sausage so we need how many just two three sausages
[130:25.14]Wait, what does this need?
[130:26.88]This needs something.
[130:27.64]Be cooked?
[130:27.96]No.
[130:28.26]It needs a plate.
[130:29.22]Oven, oven, oven, oven, the oven, the oven, the oven.
[130:34.28]Okay, this has to go in?
[130:36.50]There you go.
[130:37.82]It's plated.
[130:41.11]Okay, I'm down here.
[130:41.79]So you're down there.
[130:42.45]We need a plate on this one.
[130:44.55]So this one's cooked?
[130:45.61]Right in the middle.
[130:46.61]It doesn't need anything.
[130:47.73]It just needs sausage.
[130:48.99]Just go.
[130:49.81]It's already been cooked.
[130:50.47]You have to just turn it.
[130:51.03]Oh, fuck, okay.
[130:55.25]This one is... Plates are over here.
[130:58.02]So we need a tomato.
[130:58.88]We need a lot of tomato, actually.
[131:03.38]I'm doing the dishes right now.
[131:08.00]I'm tomatoing these.
[131:10.32]Make sure... Yes, yes, yes.
[131:12.94]You understand.
[131:13.38]Is this one done?
[131:15.21]This one needs a fucking plate.
[131:20.17]Where's the other plate?
[131:21.21]There's one right there.
[131:23.54]Pass it to me.
[131:24.90]There's a plate here, too.
[131:27.33]Okay, this one needs to go in the oven.
[131:30.81]No, give me the sausage.
[131:31.53]Put the sausage on here.
[131:35.95]It's fine.
[131:36.59]It's fine.
[131:37.47]That one's not going to get cooked in time, though.
[131:39.43]Nor is the next one.
[131:40.47]Yes, it is.
[131:41.29]We just lost an order.
[131:42.09]We just missed an order.
[131:43.27]It doesn't matter.
[131:43.69]We need more points.
[131:44.15]Why am I getting trapped?
[131:44.83]What the fuck?
[131:52.28]Which side are you going to stay on?
[131:54.31]Pick your side.
[131:54.99]I just picked up the pizza.
[131:56.43]I'm like teleporting around the game.
[132:00.59]My character keeps like rubber banding.
[132:02.17]Okay.
[132:05.33]Do you need to be the host?
[132:06.19]Do you need to be the host?
[132:07.11]No, no, no, no.
[132:07.86]We need dough.
[132:08.64]We need dough for our pizzas.
[132:09.70]Four doughs, please.
[132:11.16]I'll only give this to you if you do your best Homer Simpson impression.
[132:19.14]I would never dare desecrate.
[132:22.37]Oh, fuck.
[132:22.75]I was on the right side.
[132:23.55]Uh, we haven't been cooking?
[132:28.76]No.
[132:30.46]Well, we didn't make it to three stars.
[132:34.06]Uh, no.
[132:35.50]Correct.
[132:36.80]Yes.
[132:37.74]No, we didn't.
[132:38.16]But at least we can watch the countdown.
[132:44.95]We just froze, okay?
[132:45.87]We just froze.
[132:47.89]One star.
[132:48.37]Do it again.
[132:49.77]Don't let that happen.
[132:59.05]Okay.
[133:01.15]Here we go.
[133:03.11]Are you not redoing it?
[133:03.75]Are you getting us away from that?
[133:09.35]Zero.
[133:11.10]I love that pizza.
[133:13.92]Okay, let's do this one step at a time.
[133:15.72]Trying to get caught behind anything.
[133:17.02]Alright, cheese.
[133:17.58]Okay.
[133:19.46]Got my act together.
[133:23.19]I got the cheese.
[133:24.99]I got the sausage.
[133:27.91]Apparently I cannot put it on this plate.
[133:29.81]And I don't know why that is.
[133:34.71]We need, uh, dough.
[133:36.25]I'm gonna have to do another sausage.
[133:37.89]That's a... That's a... Good dough.
[133:40.64]No, you don't have to... It's ready for... To be plate.
[133:45.10]Okay.
[133:45.50]So now we need... Tomato?
[133:48.28]We already fucked it up.
[133:50.82]But it's okay.
[133:52.00]What the fuck is happening with my cheese?
[133:53.62]Do you need to be the host?
[133:56.22]Uh... Maybe.
[133:59.98]Okay, we got one in the oven.
[134:01.92]Up or down?
[134:02.29]Up or down?
[134:02.65]I'm going up.
[134:03.57]I'm going up.
[134:04.25]So now we need a bunch of tomato.
[134:07.81]Check it.
[134:08.09]That thing's going to be ready.
[134:15.13]Order up.
[134:17.84]I just need cheese on that one.
[134:20.12]Two orders up.
[134:21.28]Yeah, two orders up.
[134:22.04]Let's just make sure we got this one ready.
[134:23.26]This one also needs sausage, too.
[134:24.36]Get that in the oven, please.
[134:26.78]Done and done.
[134:27.64]Okay.
[134:28.46]Okay.
[134:30.58]No sausage pizza?
[134:33.82]What was that again?
[134:34.76]Which side do you want?
[134:35.96]I'm going on the right.
[134:36.96]You don't understand.
[134:39.54]I gotta be the host.
[134:40.70]I have to be the host.
[134:46.05]I have to invite you.
[134:46.83]Are you still here?
[134:52.83]Yeah.
[134:53.29]I'm just watching my workspace burn.
[134:57.11]I'm rubberbanding all over the place.
[134:58.70]I gotta invite you.
[135:03.15]I quit.
[135:03.95]You can't fire me.
[135:06.37]That poor pizza.
[135:07.54]Back to the main menu.
[135:09.06]Hopefully this is not going to lose our progress.
[135:12.76]Well, hopefully it's not local progress only, and I'm the only one with the world map progress.
[135:17.24]That would be very sad.
[135:18.44]I would be very sad about that.
[135:21.41]I would be too.
[135:22.21]So you... I'm going to back out.
[135:25.85]Leave.
[135:27.71]I'll just quit the whole game.
[135:29.01]Okay.
[135:30.59]That also works.
[135:31.45]Isn't that just special?
[135:38.12]I'm rubberbanding.
[135:38.90]Mm-hmm.
[135:40.04]Sounds like a good excuse.
[135:41.74]Well, I don't need an excuse because I have evidence, as they say.
[135:47.16]When I run down and go ping-pong around the whole screen, I don't even need an excuse.
[135:55.65]Alright.
[135:56.43]Load game, right?
[135:57.97]So how do I, like, just, can I just invite you to this?
[136:02.29]Like this?
[136:03.27]Invite?
[136:05.33]Invite.
[136:07.85]Let's bring you in.
[136:10.07]Let's make sure.
[136:11.53]I do not see any such invite.
[136:13.57]It's coming now.
[136:14.41]Oh, there it is.
[136:18.25]Are you here?
[136:20.22]It says I got the invite and that you've invited me.
[136:23.02]However, there's nothing to click on.
[136:30.48]Hold on.
[136:33.07]Invite.
[136:34.51]Try it again.
[136:39.22]Did you get it?
[136:39.66]I wonder... Oh.
[136:46.51]Hold on.
[136:47.35]Wait, were you doing something wrong?
[136:49.59]No!
[136:50.77]Uh, yes.
[136:51.59]Hang on.
[136:52.41]Time out.
[136:53.35]What?
[136:54.21]What's the matter?
[136:56.39]So, uh... Apparently, I am a freeze frame.
[137:00.09]Hold on.
[137:02.10]Oh, are you... Is your internet dying?
[137:06.68]Does he have a dead internet connection?
[137:11.33]I'm going to try turning off the game.
[137:12.65]Hang on.
[137:18.44]All because Jeremy can't handle rubber banding and a cooking mama ripoff.
[137:22.40]This has nothing to do with cooking mama.
[137:25.90]Cooking mama ripoff.
[137:27.99]This is completely different.
[137:35.21]I'm relaunching the game now.
[137:38.84]Wait, why are we saying play TF2?
[137:42.96]Why the hell would I do that?
[137:48.78]What?
[137:59.07]Play Mountain Blade.
[138:08.02]So wait, let's open up your stream.
[138:10.08]I want to see what people are saying.
[138:15.24]At your own risk.
[138:16.18]Let's see.
[138:17.48]Let's see what he's doing here.
[138:18.40]Let's spy on him.
[138:21.14]I wonder what he's streaming.
[138:24.62]Jerma985 is the best.
[138:25.76]He's the best fucking streamer in the entire world.
[138:28.00]Jerma985 is the best.
[138:29.03]He's the best fucking streamer in the entire world.
[138:31.51]Who said that?
[138:32.07]What the fuck?
[138:34.71]Who said that?
[138:35.19]I think I did, actually.
[138:38.30]Oh, why?
[138:39.26]You really are just a freeze frame.
[138:41.18]Yeah.
[138:41.32]I'm a freeze frame.
[138:43.66]Why is that happening?
[138:50.26]There we go.
[138:51.12]Alright.
[138:51.42]No.
[138:51.58]But how... I don't know how to join you.
[138:54.55]So is it not working?
[138:56.31]I just say... It just says invited you to play Overcooked 2 with no button to push.
[138:59.71]Isn't there supposed to be like a button?
[139:03.73]I guess.
[139:04.69]I keep sending it to you.
[139:05.83]Can you do like play game?
[139:08.22]It should say, like, play game.
[139:15.45]Like, the little pop-up comes up, but there's nothing there.
[139:19.62]I blame the new UI.
[139:21.26]Maybe your computer is having a overheating problem.
[139:26.46]Would you say it's overcooked?
[139:28.02]Could be.
[139:30.23]Uh, well...
[139:34.33]uh well hold on hang on it just it just repeats let me try I'm gonna try doing this real quick it'll take two seconds what are you gonna try to do restart steam oh yeah that might help in the meantime let's look at the chefs there'll be somebody new now
[139:56.26]Panda.
[139:57.78]Glasses.
[139:58.94]Teeth guy.
[140:00.18]Grandma.
[140:01.81]Mustache man is really all there is.
[140:04.49]I guess I'll be the mouse.
[140:05.35]I'll switch to mouse.
[140:11.98]Okay.
[140:12.92]Hold on.
[140:13.42]Starting back up again.
[140:14.38]It's not even a knife game.
[140:27.48]A rat with a knife.
[140:28.28]You know what I could really go for right now?
[140:33.71]A nice, clean beverage.
[140:36.25]No, I was going to say a pizza.
[140:37.15]Of the alcoholic variety.
[140:38.61]A margarita pizza.
[140:40.71]No, the pizza we were just making.
[140:42.05]I kind of want that one.
[140:43.55]Like a cheese and sauce pizza with sausage.
[140:46.55]With sausage and cheese.
[140:47.59]Yeah, that sounds pretty good.
[140:49.65]I would like that right now.
[140:51.62]Okay.
[140:52.06]This is all because you're lagging.
[140:55.00]I didn't do anything.
[140:56.46]Blame.
[140:56.80]Just blame me.
[140:58.87]So try inviting me again.
[140:59.93]Well, I mean, usually it's me.
[141:02.77]Usually I'm the one that has a ton of awful fucking problems.
[141:04.97]I think it's on your end.
[141:08.11]How?
[141:09.71]Because it doesn't even say you're playing a game.
[141:13.35]What?
[141:14.91]Like, you're just online.
[141:19.88]You're not online for me, no.
[141:21.24]Okay, there you are.
[141:27.06]Yeah, like, for you, you're not in a video game.
[141:29.96]No, yeah, I'm online.
[141:32.44]Yeah, you're online, but it doesn't say you're in a game.
[141:35.32]So I can't join your game because Steam doesn't think you're in a game.
[141:40.08]That's fucking weird.
[141:41.32]Well, whatever, you just host it, I guess.
[141:42.92]This is just, like, this is just being weird.
[141:47.14]So, just invite me.
[141:48.22]It might be, like, some privacy setting or something.
[141:50.68]I don't know.
[141:51.52]I haven't changed anything recently.
[141:54.69]This happened to somebody I knew before?
[141:57.47]Why did I paraphrase that whole sentence?
[141:59.07]This happened to my friend before.
[142:00.35]Why did I say somebody I knew?
[142:01.65]Because if you right-click me, you can probably join off me.
[142:06.56]Let's see.
[142:09.10]On the friends list.
[142:10.48]I cannot.
[142:14.00]But if you invite me... There we go.
[142:15.82]That was my game, guys.
[142:19.38]I just clicked play.
[142:23.91]You accepted an invitation, but now I can't join you, though.
[142:30.12]No, no, no.
[142:30.46]Don't do that.
[142:31.54]Send it again.
[142:38.51]What?
[142:40.31]What?
[142:41.33]Well... Well... Invite to play.
[142:45.78]There.
[142:46.02]Okay.
[142:46.50]Play a game.
[142:48.20]I accepted an invite, but it's not doing anything.
[142:50.20]Uh-huh.
[142:51.14]Yeah, I know.
[142:52.76]I don't think it's on either of our ends.
[142:56.24]I will restart this game.
[142:58.85]I'm going to restart Steam.
[143:01.31]It wouldn't be a co-op stream without a little bit of not able to play the video.
[143:05.71]By the way, speaking of shitty updates, why is Steam trying to make a worse Battle.net?
[143:13.54]I don't understand.
[143:14.10]It's just they're making Discord, and Discord's trying to sell games now.
[143:20.20]Okay.
[143:20.38]Okay.
[143:21.00]Discord is going to have their own launcher with a game shop.
[143:27.85]So everyone's just trying to be everyone.
[143:29.59]Hey, dude, don't you know if it ain't broke, break it five times in a row and then say that the community is incorrect.
[143:40.95]Steam will be dead in six years.
[143:43.59]Let's see what happens.
[143:53.49]okay go get invite me friend oh I heard it play game and that ain't working what about me to you can I invite you
[144:19.56]What?
[144:19.74]No, no, no, no.
[144:20.22]There we go.
[144:20.58]Hold on.
[144:20.96]No.
[144:23.66]No, it didn't work.
[144:29.25]Can you join that?
[144:34.23]No.
[144:35.41]There's not even a button.
[144:36.53]Okay, so when you get an invite from me, does a button pop up in chat?
[144:40.47]Yes.
[144:41.64]I have no button.
[144:42.54]It says you invited me to play Overcooked, and there's no thing to click on.
[144:47.31]Right, but we were just playing together.
[144:50.03]I just joined your game.
[144:51.03]So what changed in the 25... What changed in the two and a half hours since I clicked on to join your game?
[145:00.05]Why are we doing it?
[145:00.91]What's going on here?
[145:06.95]Well, there is an alternative here.
[145:08.18]You know what it is.
[145:10.22]There is an alternative, yes.
[145:11.52]Mm-hmm.
[145:14.31]Should we just do the alternative?
[145:16.35]Yeah, we just turn off the stream.
[145:18.12]No, that's not the alternative.
[145:21.96]We planned for a potential problem here.
[145:24.66]We're not going to turn off the stream, obviously.
[145:28.59]Check the forums.
[145:32.05]I feel like it's a Steam issue.
[145:33.99]It might be.
[145:36.27]Because I'm not even... Alright.
[145:38.90]Hang on.
[145:42.84]Do... What would you like me to do?
[145:48.44]What would you like me to do?
[145:52.66]Never mind.
[145:54.09]It's a known bug with a new UI.
[145:55.97]Is it?
[145:57.85]Need to appear online?
[145:58.79]I am appearing online.
[145:59.99]I have been for the whole time.
[146:02.31]But it has never said you're actually in a game.
[146:05.33]I think Steam just doesn't like working.
[146:09.41]Have you tried restarting Steam?
[146:10.97]I did.
[146:11.45]I just did.
[146:13.48]Just returned.
[146:14.29]I exited.
[146:15.31]Reconnected.
[146:15.79]Uh, well.
[146:20.23]It's too bad.
[146:20.91]We are having a good time there.
[146:23.55]It looks like we're moving on to Wolf Quest.
[146:29.41]Oh, boy.
[146:29.91]Ripped that band-aid right off.
[146:33.84]Not even like a build-up.
[146:35.34]Not even a build-up.
[146:37.20]Straight into it, eh?
[146:40.92]Wait, so did somebody say CSGO is down?
[146:44.30]Are we even going to be able to do this?
[146:46.32]We may not.
[146:48.02]I feel like Steam's like down.
[146:50.30]I don't know who's connecting that.
[146:53.16]Who was that?
[146:53.86]It wasn't me.
[146:55.26]I invited you.
[146:57.32]Again, just out of desperation.
[146:58.90]Hmm.
[147:04.09]Alright, well, let's just go.
[147:05.55]Let's move on.
[147:08.33]Wasting time here.
[147:09.25]Go ahead and open up your new game that we're going to play, WolfQuest.
[147:14.42]CSGO matchmaking is down.
[147:16.62]Okay.
[147:17.56]Uh-oh.
[147:18.14]So I guess it's just a problem.
[147:20.36]Oh.
[147:21.60]Alright.
[147:22.50]WolfQuest matchmaking is probably up.
[147:26.56]Not if we connect through Steam.
[147:29.24]But we'll give it a try.
[147:29.94]Is it through Steam?
[147:32.01]Is this the end?
[147:32.65]It is.
[147:33.47]It's a Steam game.
[147:34.55]Does our whole life revolve around Steam needing to be awake?
