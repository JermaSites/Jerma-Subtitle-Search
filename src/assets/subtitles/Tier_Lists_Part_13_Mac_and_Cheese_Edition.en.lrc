[00:25.63]What's what's happening?
[00:30.27]How's it going everybody?
[00:40.01]How you guys been good?
[00:44.77]Yeah, I'm back.
[00:45.29]I'm here.
[00:48.27]Yep, for one day only.
[00:50.91]Remember, I'm back for one day only.
[00:57.73]And then I'll be back again.
[00:58.79]But one day only.
[01:01.01]During the Elden Ring DLC launch.
[01:05.76]And then maybe like one day only is somewhere else and then one day only.
[01:09.26]You know, I'm going to do a lot of one day onlys.
[01:18.67]He's back.
[01:21.13]Can you guys hear me?
[01:26.05]Can anybody hear me?
[01:28.25]I forget how to do this.
[01:32.81]No, we can't.
[01:33.49]Oh, that means you can.
[01:34.45]Perfect.
[01:34.81]Alright.
[01:36.16]Alright.
[01:36.50]So let's go over a couple of things.
[01:37.78]I'm going to turn this down because I want to really talk to you about what you can expect from fucking today's stream.
[01:47.62]So long time ago, we talked on stream about how I wanted to make a mac and cheese tier list stream.
[01:56.74]Well, what I decided to do is I didn't do it.
[02:00.72]I don't have it.
[02:01.32]I don't have a video or anything.
[02:02.68]I was going to just tell you guys like on my starting soon screen what my actual favorite mac and cheeses were.
[02:09.93]And then probably just turn the stream off.
[02:13.17]Probably maybe five minutes or so.
[02:14.71]I'll just tell you my like top five.
[02:22.42]We got a 20 minute video to watch today.
[02:24.54]Okay.
[02:26.28]I made the video because it's kind of a pain in the ass to do all this.
[02:32.36]Having seven different mac and cheeses is a lot of moving around.
[02:37.28]I was going to do it originally over the course of a couple of weeks, but Holly and I came up with a solution.
[02:45.38]Works very well.
[02:49.91]Ster in chat right now.
[02:52.77]Ster, get out of here.
[02:55.68]pre-recorded yeah this is a little experiment this is a pre-recorded stream and I am not I promise because this is a 20 plus minute video I am not gonna stop I'm not gonna be like well pause it for a second listen everybody no this is a full package then we'll break it down this is a full package then we'll break it down I can't pause in the middle of this you'll understand why
[03:24.93]How come the sun is orbiting a planet?
[03:28.91]Uh, you must be new here to not understand basic fucking science.
[03:41.43]Director commentary.
[03:42.79]I mean, I'll probably talk over it a little, okay?
[03:45.39]But no pausing.
[03:46.96]This is to be watched in total completion.
[03:49.92]No pausing.
[03:50.64]I might talk over it like an asshole sometimes.
[03:53.92]We'll see.
[03:59.59]Did I give my updated Dark Souls 2 review?
[04:04.25]Did I do that?
[04:06.39]I don't know.
[04:09.13]Did I?
[04:12.16]No.
[04:12.96]No, I definitely did, didn't I?
[04:14.10]Oh, I might have.
[04:17.46]Okay.
[04:18.96]I have to make an apology to all the Dark Souls 2 fans.
[04:23.31]It's been two months, so people that watched it before probably don't even remember.
[04:26.37]I'll just do it again.
[04:27.51]So, uh, I played Dark Souls 2 recently, off-stream.
[04:33.08]And let me tell you, that game is not as bad as I said it was.
[04:38.30]Not even close.
[04:41.06]I feel bad that I said that was the worst Souls game.
[04:44.07]It's not.
[04:46.30]It's like a big fun Disneyland, Dark Souls.
[04:50.97]I forgot just how much charm was in that game.
[04:54.15]And let me also tell you, let me also give you a little bit of what you can expect maybe potentially here.
[05:00.77]So I have, this is a mac and cheese review watch party.
[05:04.99]That's what we're going to do here.
[05:07.19]But I have probably, oh man.
[05:12.57]at least seven or eight hundred clips that I've recorded of stuff like Dark Souls 2, an old Bloodborne playthrough I had.
[05:21.43]Just dumb shit that I thought was funny that I capped on my console, like with the Xbox button.
[05:28.36]And what I want to do is I want to make a compilation of all the kind of things I've done and just do another kind of watch party where we just hang out and watch them.
[05:39.30]Whenever that is, right?
[05:40.46]That's not, I'm not going to give you a time for it, but
[05:44.30]I got a lot of Dark Souls 2 clips that I think are hilarious.
[05:47.02]Some of them aren't even funny at all.
[05:48.82]But that's not even the point anymore.
[05:49.98]The point is... Let's just do whatever the fuck we want, you know?
[05:55.57]If I show you 25 Dark Souls 2 clips and eight of them suck... Well, that's for you to decide.
[06:04.63]Who cares?
[06:07.61]But yeah, I will tell you the next time you will see me after today, I mean, guaranteed at least, is the Elden Ring DLC launch party.
[06:16.86]I don't know why everything has to have party at the end of it.
[06:19.04]No, we're doing the watch party, launch party.
[06:23.52]Everything's a party.
[06:29.79]Yeah, I hope everyone's doing alright.
[06:30.73]I want to just kind of check in.
[06:31.59]This is not going to be a long stream.
[06:32.87]I told you before that this is... I want to play this video.
[06:36.41]We can talk about it.
[06:37.57]We can chill.
[06:38.37]Do I have any of the thoughts for you guys before we watch this?
[06:46.30]Why are you doing a Robin Williams routine?
[06:49.38]What do you mean?
[06:53.12]Huh?
[07:01.50]Did somebody just say, you're old news?
[07:05.06]Yeah, that's fine with me.
[07:06.26]I don't give a fuck.
[07:08.86]That's perfect, actually.
[07:10.56]That's perfect.
[07:21.48]Why are you acting so ooey gooey today?
[07:23.37]It's because I ate a lot of cheese.
[07:26.83]What have you been doing for four months?
[07:28.09]I don't know.
[07:31.55]I'm working at off-brand.
[07:32.41]Some stuff coming that you'll see.
[07:36.05]Should be a lot of fun.
[07:37.65]You may even see me a part of some of it.
[07:40.73]I'd pay attention.
[07:43.51]I've been living life.
[07:46.14]Trying new things.
[07:49.52]Playing through all the Dark Souls games in a row on the couch and recording like a thousand clips.
[07:56.12]I guess that happened at some point over the last two or three years.
[08:04.35]He's been hibernating.
[08:08.37]Are we going to get abandoned again?
[08:09.71]Hey, going forward in the retirement arc.
[08:14.73]It's not about being, it's not about being abandoned.
[08:17.48]It's about, see you next time.
[08:21.34]Did I say that wrong?
[08:27.06]However you're, okay, however that would have come across as like way nicer than it may have just done, right?
[08:40.40]Are we going to get a facecam?
[08:41.86]This entire video is a facecam.
[08:44.96]You're going to get... It's all face.
[08:47.76]And a little bit of body.
[08:49.38]And a lot of chewing mouth sounds that I desperately tried to edit out.
[08:52.86]Because I made this video.
[08:55.55]And you're going to be able to tell because holy shit.
[08:57.77]I was just having fun.
[08:59.85]I didn't even care what the fuck I was doing.
[09:01.35]I was putting in weird music and stuff.
[09:02.93]I don't want to spoil it.
[09:07.68]Yeah, are you guys ready to watch the mac and cheese tier list?
[09:10.62]It's not even a tier list, but like a review and rating stream?
[09:13.88]Are you guys ready?
[09:14.46]I've been waiting four months for this.
[09:19.43]I'm going to assure you that the quality of this video is not waiting four months for.
[09:24.49]But I made it, and I'm happy with it, and I'm going to show it right now.
[09:29.87]So without further ado... Ladies and gentlemen...
[09:34.77]I hope you've got something to hang out with for the next 20 something minutes while we watch this and I'm not going to talk over it.
[09:42.25]You ready?
[09:43.73]The mac and cheese.
[09:44.92]Oh, I have to.
[09:45.68]There's a couple of pieces of context I have to put here.
[09:48.02]Let's turn this off.
[09:49.44]Alright.
[09:49.96]Very important context.
[09:51.18]I know people are going to be like, well, dude, how come you didn't get this one?
[09:53.62]Why didn't you get that one?
[09:54.64]This mac and cheese is way better.
[09:56.16]Just hold on.
[09:56.72]Just please sit down.
[09:58.85]I only did boxed cheddar mac and cheeses.
[10:04.71]Boxed.
[10:05.69]No frozen stuff.
[10:06.69]That is a different category to me.
[10:09.53]Frozen mac and cheese is a different category.
[10:13.35]Boxed mac and cheese is its own.
[10:15.20]There's seven here.
[10:19.02]I could do a whole one on frozen and then maybe go against each other.
[10:23.80]But I don't know if I'm going to do that.
[10:28.85]So these are boxed only, and they were all prepared exactly the same to the instructions on the box.
[10:37.44]Didn't change it.
[10:38.28]I didn't say, well, you know what?
[10:39.14]Maybe I'll put oat milk in this.
[10:41.48]No, no.
[10:41.82]This is all by the box, by the book.
[10:49.41]Okay.
[10:49.73]What about the frozen pizza string?
[10:53.24]Look, let's do this one first, and then you guys can tell me how much you either loved or hated this.
[10:58.95]And regardless of the outcome, I'm going to do whatever I want.
[11:01.73]So, you have absolutely no say in anything that happens going forward.
[11:06.19]So, um... He's a tyrant.
[11:14.32]Yeah.
[11:14.48]Yeah.
[11:21.96]Don't you ever stream again.
[11:24.42]No, I'm kidding.
[11:25.32]Alright, you guys ready?
[11:26.26]Let's play it.
[11:27.42]I'm going to let it play.
[11:29.04]You've been waiting a long time for this.
[11:31.08]Get your popcorn ready, because here comes the quintessential mac and cheese rating stream.
[11:37.89]Thank you very much.
[11:40.87]I'm going to shut up now.
[11:43.95]Quiet down in the back back there.
[11:47.75]Okay, here we go.
[11:50.03]I think we've waited long enough for enough people to kind of trickle in.
[11:53.45]In three, two, one, action.
[12:02.94]To make sure that this works, this is a test to make sure that you can hear me.
[12:06.12]Because what you're about to see is a mac and cheese fucking stream dude.
[12:13.48]I haven't made a video in like seven years.
[12:18.15]So sorry, I haven't spent a while.
[12:20.92]Seven different brands, seven powerhouses, seven colossuses, colossi in the mac and cheese world are gonna go up against each other today, are gonna go up and are gonna fight each other today in my stream.
[12:35.79]Let's get a palate cleanse to start, because we need a base level.
[12:41.01]You don't see anything up here yet, but that's fine.
[12:49.03]I should brush my fucking hair.
[12:50.07]You know what's funny?
[13:11.85]I actually don't even eat that much mac and cheese anymore.
[13:15.19]I think like seven or eight months ago when I brought this up, I was like, oh yeah, I'll do a mac and cheese review stream, a review watch party.
[13:22.59]I stopped, I like changed my whole diet.
[13:24.61]My whole like life has been, my lifestyle has changed.
[13:27.49]I don't even eat this shit anymore.
[13:29.63]I don't know what each one of these is.
[13:32.80]I know what I bought and I know what cartons exist.
[13:36.52]And you'll be able to see on the screen too.
[13:38.58]But I don't want to know exactly which one is what because I don't want to go in with bias.
[13:42.72]I'm going to show each one of these and I'll say which one it is.
[13:45.24]So you can kind of have a corresponding mac and cheese to box.
[13:49.41]But again, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[13:54.39]I'm going to go in a row.
[13:55.19]I'm going to be able to... I'm going to arrange them too.
[13:57.13]You'll see.
[13:57.51]You'll get it.
[13:57.99]You'll...
[14:04.10]These are all perfect temperature, perfectly cooked to al dente.
[14:12.06]Interesting.
[14:12.44]Smells really light.
[14:20.21]I feel like I know what this one is.
[14:21.17]Because I think this one was cheating.
[14:23.65]Because I got cheddar for every single one of these.
[14:27.65]But the problem is... Trader Joe's was sold out.
[14:33.23]but this is pretty fucking good they weren't sold out of this one but I don't think they did trader Joe's ever carry a cheddar mac and cheese or am I crazy uh this is definitely trader Joe's and it's it's it's up there super light it's that white cheddar I think I am crazy by the way it's very good I don't know where to place it though I'm gonna say that's like a high b I don't know where it goes next to everything else
[15:03.58]There we go.
[15:05.51]What's this one?
[15:26.48]It's really thick.
[15:29.02]It's really thick.
[15:31.86]I would say it's good, but I don't know.
[15:38.02]I think I know what this one is too.
[15:42.76]I think it's passable.
[15:44.07]I think it's like good enough.
[15:45.97]I wouldn't say I would order this.
[15:47.09]I would get this like for dinner.
[15:49.45]But if you handed this to me and you said, hey dude, I got some mac and cheese for you.
[15:55.44]I'd be like, yeah, this is fine.
[15:57.16]The flavor's not really there for me.
[15:59.42]It's a little lacking on flavor.
[16:04.30]But it's definitely a Velveeta, and it's definitely a C. So I'm gonna say C. This one's better, even though it doesn't count, because it's white cheddar.
[16:11.62]I know, I'm a fucking idiot.
[16:14.61]This is three.
[16:17.03]Some of you might know what that one is.
[16:18.69]I think I do too, but might not be so sure.
[16:24.80]You know, before I eat this, I think that we should probably just get an opinion from somebody else.
[16:32.36]Not about this.
[16:33.72]Not about this.
[16:35.14]But about something else.
[16:37.13]So let me leave no further ado here for a special guest review from Ster for the Trader Joe's Tikka Masala.
[16:46.14]Take it away, Ster.
[16:47.44]Yo, what is going on, everybody?
[16:49.40]Ster here with yet another ultimate banger of a food review coming in here with a cult classic.
[16:55.82]Everybody has been telling me to try this.
[16:57.84]I'm so excited for it, but actually it was so exclusive, so hard to get my hands on that only just recently did I find out that you can only get this at Trader Joe's.
[17:07.96]Who would have known who was going to be able to find such a gem like this?
[17:12.12]Of course, I'm talking about the chicken.
[17:14.24]Fuck!
[17:15.14]fuck and at the other side you can of course see that it says keep frozen this is a frozen dish and I fully intend to keep it frozen I looked inside and it's kind of disgusting looking and I really have absolutely no desire to try this whatsoever but I don't want to leave you with no food review of course we're gonna do a food review uh I've got my potion set my alchemy lab my potions I've got my potions I'm gonna show you my potions
[17:38.54]These potent little brews are sure to please.
[17:41.40]And of course we have the classic as well.
[17:44.30]The succulent, ever-common health potion.
[17:47.00]Greater, of course.
[17:48.48]But we all know of its tastes.
[17:50.40]I need not review this for you.
[17:52.81]Maybe we pop open this black bile venom from a twelve-legged arachnid.
[18:01.07]No, we save that for another day.
[18:02.69]Please subscribe.
[18:04.13]Today, you may not have heard of.
[18:06.96]Very unique in texture.
[18:09.70]Take a gander at this, you Ganesh.
[18:14.95]Awesome.
[18:18.71]Thank you, Ster.
[18:19.85]I'm glad he liked it.
[18:21.07]Of course he did.
[18:21.57]It's the Trader Joe's Tikka Masala.
[18:23.73]Thank you, Ster.
[18:24.31]Appreciate the review.
[18:25.53]Alright.
[18:25.95]So here we go.
[18:28.63]This is number three.
[18:36.35]That fucking video.
[18:42.42]I like this one a lot for a lot of different reasons.
[18:44.66]And I don't know if it's Kraft or not.
[18:47.59]Because there's another one here that looks... This one's also pretty light.
[18:57.45]Is Kraft this light?
[18:59.35]I like this one a lot.
[19:01.70]If this is Kraft, I'm going to fucking be pissed.
[19:03.64]Because I've been lying to myself for a decade.
[19:07.86]Very good.
[19:08.86]I'd say this is A, at least.
[19:15.37]Okay, texturally, this one's the best by far.
[19:19.59]I actually don't hate that, the more that I think about it.
[19:21.37]I'm gonna have to go back and forth a little bit.
[19:22.75]Let's go, here we go, this is number four.
[19:23.95]This one's really good.
[19:34.65]You get that deep, like right here, that little cheddar flavor.
[19:39.98]It's got a great texture.
[19:44.15]This is damn good.
[19:44.93]I would say this is like the best one.
[19:48.37]I like these two for different reasons, but I would say this is S. The cheese sticks to the noodles.
[19:53.95]One thing I really don't like is when you make a mac and cheese and the cheese kind of falls off.
[19:58.82]It kind of doesn't stick.
[20:01.96]Hey, how about another special guest review?
[20:14.08]The chicken tikka masala, quested from Jerma.
[20:21.09]Rice, chicken, sauce.
[20:24.41]Here we go.
[20:25.03]This is busting.
[20:33.35]This owns.
[20:33.91]This is really good.
[20:37.47]I've eaten almost this whole thing since that video played.
[20:40.98]This is definitely the best one.
[20:43.44]It just tastes like cheese.
[20:45.49]It tastes like cheese.
[20:46.65]There's a cheese.
[20:48.53]A lot of times you eat a mac and cheese and it just kind of tastes like somebody put cheesy kind of, oh yeah, it's like cheese flavoring.
[20:55.27]That tastes like cheese.
[20:58.31]Very similar.
[20:59.10]Number five.
[21:00.58]I don't know what that was.
[21:01.22]Incredibly similar to the last one, which is this is going to be tough.
[21:06.74]Got a good jiggle on it.
[21:13.91]Oh no, it's a rhinoceros.
[21:15.39]That's the sound it was.
[21:16.15]Okay.
[21:16.91]I know what it is.
[21:22.39]This one reminds me of this one.
[21:25.03]Of two.
[21:27.69]I would say this is the elbow macaroni version of two.
[21:35.40]But it's a little less thick.
[21:39.97]That one is way better than this one.
[21:41.75]I hope this is not Cracker Barrel.
[21:43.97]Because if this is Cracker Barrel, then oh boy.
[21:46.73]What was it?
[21:47.51]Oh boy.
[21:48.31]Oh boy, did I fuck up.
[21:49.58]Because if that is Kraft... Oh boy, that's going to be... I'm going to have to live that one down.
[21:56.84]Who cares?
[21:57.32]If it's good, it's good.
[21:59.78]I think this is the Kraft Deluxe.
[22:07.32]Someone said this was edited in the movies.
[22:10.88]I think it's better than the Velveeta because that's definitely what that is.
[22:13.49]Because this Velveeta has a very specific taste.
[22:17.33]Velveeta tastes like Velveeta.
[22:19.99]It's not even, oh yeah, it tastes like a cheddar cheese or Swiss or provolone.
[22:24.90]No, Velveeta is Velveeta.
[22:27.16]That's the flavor.
[22:28.36]You know what it is when you taste it.
[22:30.00]It's that.
[22:33.26]Do you want a...
[22:36.38]Special guest review.
[22:37.92]How's it going, guys?
[22:38.48]Reviewing the chicken tikka masala from Trader Joe's today.
[22:41.84]I decided to do it in the oven because I thought it'd taste better.
[22:44.16]So let's give it a bite.
[22:51.11]Wow.
[22:51.75]That's great flavor.
[22:53.35]Not saying 8.5 out of 10.
[22:54.17]That's great.
[22:54.91]That's great.
[23:00.76]Craft, definitely.
[23:14.34]Oh, yeah.
[23:18.54]Yep.
[23:19.26]This is absolutely Kraft because it's cheesy.
[23:24.57]I'll edit that part out.
[23:26.41]Kraft macaroni and cheese just tastes like cooked macaroni.
[23:30.69]It doesn't taste like cheese.
[23:33.33]That was always my problem with it.
[23:37.68]I would eat this whole box if you gave it to me.
[23:40.92]I think it's better than this.
[23:42.46]Wait, hold on.
[23:43.64]Because this is either Cracker Barrel or the other crap, Deluxe.
[23:47.20]So let's see.
[23:49.14]Yeah, it's alright.
[23:51.19]I would say Deluxe is better because that's what that is.
[23:54.21]That's absolutely the Cheetos bag.
[23:55.59]It has to be.
[23:57.25]There's no way it's not.
[23:57.91]Number seven.
[24:00.29]I actually might have to move a couple of these though.
[24:03.34]I already know this one sucks and I already know I'm going to give it an F.
[24:07.61]And I don't even, honestly, I don't even know why, I don't know why it's on this list.
[24:11.27]I don't.
[24:13.69]We got a, one of those special guest reviews.
[24:18.87]I'll get out of the way.
[24:23.51]Hey, so this stuff is really good, but since the last time I got it, it just feels like there's less of it than there used to be.
[24:30.52]Like something's missing.
[24:32.62]And it's delicious, but I don't know, the portions just feel...
[24:44.54]It's gonna be an F. I'm not even kidding.
[25:06.02]It's not an F.
[25:07.66]I mean, it sucks.
[25:09.80]It's not an F. Okay, you know when you're done with the Cheetos bag?
[25:17.20]You've finished it.
[25:18.92]And you got that, you pop, you puff it open.
[25:22.34]And you smell in the bag.
[25:23.45]Oh boy.
[25:25.97]This tastes like you smelled in the bag.
[25:28.29]Right at the last, when you're finished.
[25:31.82]It smells like the inside of... It tastes like it smells like the inside of a Cheetos bag.
[25:36.95]I could definitely see somebody eating this for a birthday party.
[25:41.15]Not as a 38-year-old man right now.
[25:46.53]And I know, like, whatever.
[25:48.03]Who fucking cares, dude, if you like Cheetos, mac and cheese?
[25:51.05]I don't care either.
[25:53.37]But I'm not making this for dinner every Thursday.
[25:55.71]It's not happening.
[25:56.35]This is for a birthday party.
[25:59.59]Can we have a special guest treat review?
[26:02.67]Welcome back everybody for another segment of Eat Al Eats.
[26:05.79]Today I'm bringing you the chicken tikka masala from Trader Joe's, which of course is authentic Indian recipe as it says right here.
[26:13.68]We got the plate.
[26:14.96]Let's go ahead and dig in and see what we're dealing with today.
[26:21.22]What is your assessment?
[26:23.02]Come on.
[26:24.87]Come on, tell us.
[26:26.23]What did you like?
[26:27.39]It's definitely cheesier than I thought it was going to be after looking at the box.
[26:36.80]Like it says, roasted chicken.
[26:38.84]9 out of 10.
[26:47.16]I would say this is my, it looks, it's flipped.
[26:50.34]I'll flip the video.
[26:52.52]So this is what I'm looking at here.
[26:55.41]I believe, and I'm probably going to get this right, and in the post video, I will add some things, because I obviously don't really know 100% right now.
[27:06.47]But I'm going to say this is the best one.
[27:09.25]I would give that an S. This is second best.
[27:11.80]I'd give this one an A. This is third best, although if you want to not count it, if you don't want to count it, that's fine, because it's Trader Joe's white cheddar.
[27:19.40]So let's say you didn't count that.
[27:22.14]Then here is the rest of it.
[27:24.69]Okay, that is definitely Kraft Deluxe.
[27:28.36]This is Kraft Regular.
[27:31.66]This is the Cheetos inside of the bag, smell, taste one.
[27:35.52]And this is Velveeta.
[27:37.04]This is important.
[27:37.68]I need to find out which one of these is the worst.
[27:39.08]So, but if it wasn't, right?
[27:40.24]Let's just say that if you allowed this, this would be the third one.
[27:44.20]This would be number three.
[27:45.68]So, but if you don't allow that and you just want straight just cheddar, this is cheese cheddar flavor, like some of the more popular ones.
[27:54.63]I gotta figure out if this one's worse than this one.
[27:57.03]I don't really love the Velveeta taste.
[27:59.75]I don't, I don't know.
[28:00.33]I don't know if that's, but is that worse than the fucking birthday party one?
[28:06.95]Can you imagine sitting around with like the birthday party where it's like, oh, pizza, ice cream, Cheetos mac and cheese, whoa!
[28:18.68]Everybody, the whole table would start screaming.
[28:21.63]The decibel level of that room would go up to like seven.
[28:24.39]It'd be like a jet engine in that room.
[28:25.91]If it's a birthday party, this is up here.
[28:28.39]If it's not a birthday party, it's worse than Velveeta.
[28:32.89]I just don't want it.
[28:33.87]I don't want the Cheetos flavor at dinner.
[28:36.71]I don't want to eat like a bag of Cheetos with a fucking steak.
[28:41.46]It's like, oh yeah, mashed potatoes, chicken, Cheetos.
[28:45.88]Like, oh, I almost just did it.
[28:47.44]You almost got it out of me.
[28:48.88]You almost got it.
[28:52.37]It's light Wait a second Wait a second, no, this is Kraft This one's Kraft, I think Wait, no it's not, what the fuck's going on?
[29:11.78]Shit, I actually don't know This one's lighter This is Kraft, this one's lighter This one's like, no, no, this one's got more cheese flavor
[29:21.95]Annie's has way more cheese flavor.
[29:28.40]I like this one better, but it changed on me.
[29:32.78]No, alright, now you're gonna get the real me.
[29:34.21]You're gonna get the without anything in my mouth.
[29:37.40]after this other special guest review, because I actually don't know how many that actually were sent to me.
[29:42.06]I asked a few, I asked quite a few people and let's see how many I got.
[29:45.90]Hey, how's it going guys?
[29:46.88]Here reviewing the chicken tikka masala from Trader Joe's.
[29:51.02]It was the frozen one.
[29:52.02]I did it in the oven because I thought it would taste better.
[29:54.93]Here's how it looks.
[29:56.55]So not as big of chunks of meat as the box, but I'm going to give it a bite and see how it is.
[30:09.47]That's amazing.
[30:10.09]8.5 out of 10.
[30:11.81]That's great.
[30:13.62]This is my quintessential popular mac and cheese review stream.
[30:21.49]Best, very good, better, good birthday party.
[30:29.27]Any questions?
[30:30.90]Alright, so from now, going forward... Now I'd like to take this opportunity to harmonize singing with me.
[30:36.96]Oh, hold on.
[30:37.30]I'm sitting right there.
[30:39.26]Jerma?
[30:39.94]Yep.
[30:49.26]Alright, this next part is... Now I know.
[30:52.46]Now I know.
[30:53.02]They're all good.
[30:54.28]You'll see.
[30:55.48]Mac and cheese is mac and cheese.
[30:57.58]You can't really go wrong.
[30:59.10]It's not like, oh, my God, this one, these ones are disgusting.
[31:01.92]And these ones are delicious.
[31:04.52]You just have a preference.
[31:05.82]I have a preference towards Kraft Deluxe, Annie's, and Cracker Barrel.
[31:14.00]This one seriously is so good, though.
[31:15.38]And the other flavors are really good, too.
[31:18.13]I swear to God, this one's really good.
[31:19.21]There you have it.
[31:24.23]There's it.
[31:31.53]Okay, bye.
[31:33.66]There you have it.
[31:35.84]There's the mac and cheese quintessential.
[31:40.16]I'll tell you, I'm very, very upset.
[31:44.39]You want to see?
[31:44.89]There.
[31:46.91]Okay, well, the webcam doesn't work, apparently.
[31:49.67]So just pretend it does.
[31:56.70]I assure you that's what I look like right now.
[31:58.70]I'm sitting in the chair and I look very angry.
[32:02.46]Okay.
[32:03.78]So let's go over a couple things.
[32:04.92]I was shocked.
[32:12.09]I feel like I'm reviewing my own video.
[32:16.27]Okay, listen.
[32:18.63]I had genuine shock on my face when I realized that the Craft Deluxe was better
[32:27.70]than all of them.
[32:29.70]It was shocking to me.
[32:34.66]I couldn't believe it.
[32:35.46]Because to me, honestly, Cracker Barrel, to me, was always S tier.
[32:40.32]And it still is.
[32:41.85]In principle.
[32:46.36]Annie's, okay, if I wanted to retroactively go back and change that score, I would change maybe Annie's to S. But I have a preference to the elbow macaroni.
[32:59.39]I didn't say it.
[33:00.73]I didn't say it in the video.
[33:03.09]But is that the thumbnail?
[33:07.63]The thumbnail is one of the two Ludwig videos.
[33:11.80]Ugh.
[33:16.74]Like, what am I watching here?
[33:21.89]Thanks to everyone that sent me a video.
[33:25.03]Thank you if you're watching this right now.
[33:27.31]You didn't have to do that.
[33:29.57]I appreciate it.
[33:30.21]I thought it was fun to see how many of you actually would eat the tikka masala.
[33:34.21]And of course, Ster.
[33:36.41]Ster just sent me that.
[33:38.89]And remember, keep in mind, I'm going to tell you the direction that I gave to everybody.
[33:42.93]This is the direction I gave to Ster.
[33:45.55]Hey, Ster, could you record like a 20 second video of you tasting and scoring the tikka masala from Trader Joe's?
[33:53.86]And then he said, no, he said, I don't think I can do it.
[33:57.70]I'm not going to be able to do it.
[33:59.52]I'm like, alright, well, you're going to do it.
[34:01.50]And he's like, no, dude, I can't, I can't do it.
[34:03.22]And he's like, you know what?
[34:04.16]Maybe I'll send you something really quick.
[34:06.22]And I'm like, okay.
[34:06.87]Like he's, uh, by the way, this is last night.
[34:09.53]This was yesterday.
[34:12.03]He still didn't send me a video.
[34:14.42]And he's like, alright, maybe I'll give it, maybe I'll give you like a five second thing.
[34:17.56]I wake up this morning before rendering this and there is a full, like completed video in my, in my messages.
[34:29.99]And I'm like, holy shit.
[34:31.43]He went all in on this and he didn't even eat it.
[34:34.21]He didn't even eat it.
[34:35.01]It just, it set the tone.
[34:37.67]It was perfect.
[34:38.37]It was perfect placement.
[34:42.76]So just so you know, the Ster video would not have been in that corner if I had done this stream last week.
[34:51.00]And I'll tell you, a bad mac and cheese video is bad forever.
[34:55.41]A delayed mac and cheese video is delicious.
[34:59.30]I had a lot of fun making it.
[35:00.32]It was actually really fun.
[35:01.92]That's kind of what I... the point of... of doing this... was... not that... in the beginning, I made it very clearly.
[35:09.60]That's the first time I've really made a video in a very long time.
[35:13.70]I took away kind of the... the stuff that kind of, quote, needs to be there.
[35:19.10]Like, oh, it has to be this way.
[35:20.80]It has to be this.
[35:21.70]I have to do the... No, I just was like, you know what?
[35:23.76]I'm going to record this, and I'm just going to make a fucking stupid-ass video.
[35:27.44]And just, that's it.
[35:28.20]And then just have fun with it.
[35:30.04]That's kind of what I was talking about.
[35:32.39]Six months ago when I was talking about do stuff for fun, not because it has to be a certain way or has to act a certain way.
[35:38.53]It was just fun to make that video.
[35:43.31]And if we do these every so often, just kind of hanging out, throwing it up there, talking some shit for like an hour, you know, that's, I'm into that.
[35:51.70]I think it's not, now be honest with me.
[35:54.86]If we can get a poll up here.
[35:57.78]Did you guys like this?
[36:00.10]Did you guys like... I'm not ending the stream yet.
[36:01.46]We'll chill for a little longer.
[36:03.00]But did you enjoy kind of like a... Everyone kind of sits around for a watch party?
[36:08.00]It's like it's a video, but it's not a video.
[36:09.42]We're just all here kind of watching it and reacting at the same time.
[36:18.64]Because I have a lot of footage that I can just kind of cut around and just talk over.
[36:23.58]Public domain movies.
[36:24.65]Yeah, that's true.
[36:25.27]That also works.
[36:35.08]You should upload it too.
[36:36.22]Yeah, actually, I don't, I don't know what I'm going to do with this.
[36:39.58]I have a 20 minute review video that, I mean, I guess I could just put it up on either the second channel or on the main channel.
[36:49.44]I don't, the main channel to me is a vault, right?
[36:53.91]I feel like opening up the vault and putting in a different artifact is like, I'll get cursed.
[37:01.51]You're like, okay, I'm going to open up that vault of the old channel.
[37:05.36]And like the curse of Otto's Big Adventure 2 is going to possess me.
[37:10.74]And it's going to be bad.
[37:16.11]Like that is a vault and it is sealed in my mind.
[37:26.73]Are you ending?
[37:27.43]No, not yet.
[37:28.15]I want to chill for a little while.
[37:30.14]This stream was always going to be short, though.
[37:32.48]Why don't we just do this and chill for a little bit?
[37:35.60]I absolutely will stream the Elden Ring DLC.
[37:38.51]I know that's like a month away, but I don't really have a plan.
[37:41.65]I don't really have that many plans on stream anymore.
[37:45.89]If it was something that sounded fun, I would do it.
[37:47.63]This sounded like a lot of fun, and I had a lot of fun doing it, so here it is.
[37:51.02]Presented to you Saturday afternoon.
[37:57.76]The Elden Ring trailer.
[37:59.56]Yeah, there's a lot going on in that game.
[38:03.23]There's a shitload going on in that game.
[38:08.57]This is the first stream you've been to?
[38:10.11]Oh, damn.
[38:11.23]Well, hey.
[38:14.79]Back to retirement.
[38:17.72]We never left retirement.
[38:21.40]What about the dog food tier list?
[38:23.48]I'll give you a little bit of insight.
[38:25.12]Do you remember when I said...
[38:28.00]Hey everybody, it's time for a special treat review.
[38:31.80]Weird, you know, right after that the Etalyx shows up.
[38:36.65]Originally that was going to be Otto's treat tier list was going to be there.
[38:41.97]But a couple things happened when I was going to do it.
[38:46.44]I think it was going to be too long.
[38:50.50]And I figured if I was going to do that, I would just do it as its own thing and just put it on a stream randomly.
[38:56.24]Like when we're just hanging out.
[38:57.20]Oh, like here's like a seven and a half minute auto tier list stream.
[39:01.90]It's actually really funny because I actually, if you, I'm sure you'd be able to watch the vlog and go back and see the video.
[39:07.76]When I say, oh, okay, give us your assessment.
[39:10.46]I say auto, but I turned the volume down.
[39:13.74]So I don't say, hey, auto and like Etalyx is right there.
[39:20.33]It's like, oh, give us your assessment, Otto.
[39:23.38]But I had already pre-recorded all that, right?
[39:26.30]So I was like, oh, shit, I'm not doing the Otto one.
[39:29.10]But I don't really want to go set everything up and, like, go back over there.
[39:31.84]No.
[39:32.08]So we're just going to delete everything that references any Otto.
[39:35.22]And just someone's going to be there.
[39:36.72]Whoever it is.
[39:37.16]I also love the second Ludwig take.
[39:42.02]It just makes me laugh every single time.
[39:44.35]It's just so perfect.
[39:47.69]I love getting the two takes.
[39:51.70]I even asked him, I was like, hey, do you cool with me like putting both these takes in?
[39:54.87]He's like, yeah, dude, let's go.
[39:57.85]Like, yeah, let's do it.
[40:11.25]Looking very, very pirate deckhand in this photo.
[40:14.49]I don't know why the webcam does this, but it does.
[40:16.83]And I have to restart OBS data to work again.
[40:24.77]Thumbnail update.
[40:25.57]It's probably just this.
[40:33.58]Swap the deck mate.
[40:34.52]You need to go back to sorcery.
[40:37.86]Yeah, I just I need to be realistic with myself and with everybody here though.
[40:44.12]I have no plans.
[40:46.18]I just, whenever it's gonna happen, I'll be like, let's fucking go.
[40:49.65]Motivation kicks in.
[40:51.55]It's like, let's do it.
[40:53.51]Because I can't, I'll tell you one thing, I can't just turn on the stream and do a stream.
[40:59.28]It's not that I don't like it.
[41:00.32]It's not that I don't like being here and hanging out.
[41:01.72]Look at me right now.
[41:02.48]I'm having a fucking blast.
[41:03.36]This is awesome.
[41:05.13]But I'd rather do it when I, like, really am, like, you know, I got the hunger, the urge, the let's go, the ambition, the appetite.
[41:16.82]If it's not there, then I just don't want to turn it on and be like, hey, what's up?
[41:19.68]I'm going to fucking stream because I have to.
[41:26.15]The rage.
[41:32.01]And I'm having a good old time.
[41:39.72]He's no longer hungry.
[41:41.52]What am I drinking?
[41:42.10]This is coffee.
[41:43.56]Just a coffee.
[41:46.13]How's off-brand going?
[41:46.89]Good.
[41:48.49]A couple of things that I have spent some time on, you'll see.
[41:51.31]You'll probably even see me in them.
[41:56.89]I do have a couple of parts in some upcoming streams for off-brand.
[42:02.90]On Ludwig's channel, specifically.
[42:07.80]What's off-brand?
[42:08.42]Off-brand is a production company.
[42:10.56]that I now work for.
[42:14.24]I am the Chief Creative Officer of Off-Brand Productions.
[42:22.52]I work on such things as creating the creative vision of some of the things we do.
[42:30.46]Oh no, somebody shot him with a slow-mo gun!
[42:44.26]Did you see the new Valve game?
[42:47.30]Yeah, I don't... I don't know.
[42:48.84]I don't know.
[42:49.48]I've seen... I've heard of it.
[42:50.90]I've seen of it.
[42:52.28]It's just like, yeah, I've heard of it.
[42:54.26]I don't know.
[42:54.58]It's... Elden Ring DLC.
[42:57.57]It's the only thing in my brain right now.
[43:07.83]The videos the second channel uploads make it seem like you died.
[43:10.81]Well...
[43:21.21]I did not.
[43:23.89]I just kind of stopped streaming a lot.
[43:31.16]You want to play Destiny 2?
[43:32.82]I played Destiny 2 already.
[43:39.90]What about the speedrunning event?
[43:41.62]I will be...
[43:44.12]You may see a little bit of me at the speedrunning event.
[43:51.15]Just saying.
[43:51.95]You might.
[44:01.37]More Wrestling Empire.
[44:10.83]Yeah, I've been kind of just kind of showing up random places.
[44:13.96]Which is fun.
[44:15.76]I keep seeing people bring up comments like, man, he just kind of appears in random fucking places now.
[44:22.75]Yeah, I'm like, sometimes I'm just going to show up where you maybe least expect me.
[44:31.01]Little side quests, yeah.
[44:36.26]Can you have a stream where you chill out and have fun?
[44:40.53]Yeah, I think we're doing that right now.
[44:53.28]More.
[44:53.88]That's all you say is more.
[44:56.92]More what?
[45:02.58]Your second channel hit 300 million views.
[45:04.75]How does it feel?
[45:05.49]That's crazy.
[45:08.23]That's a lot of numbers.
[45:10.90]That's a lot of numbers.
[45:12.40]More.
[45:17.92]Do more Jerma mewing.
[45:19.40]Yeah, okay, so if I were to do another food thing, you know, let's say six months from now, what do you guys think?
[45:33.39]Do you want more food stuff?
[45:37.67]Or should I do some gadgets?
[45:39.41]I know that's a bizarre question.
[45:42.63]What, okay, what is the, if I, look, I got a long way to go.
[45:46.86]If, if I want to do the, the kind of rollercoaster ride of review and do rating streams or videos or watch parties, or even, even if it is a stream, what's the next step?
[46:00.93]Is it pizza?
[46:02.57]Frozen pizzas?
[46:09.74]gadgets gardening I would do a gardening stream I wrote that on the document we want streams not six months from now I cannot promise you well actually yes I can there will be a stream in the next six months because Elden Ring comes out in like three and a half weeks
[46:39.81]Just find the most obscure shit and review it.
[46:45.85]Rate every Family Guy episode.
[46:53.11]Can I put them all in like C or B?
[47:02.58]Just put the entire catalog into like B minus.
[47:09.18]Because there's some Family Guy episodes that are bangers, and then there's like a hundred that are not at all.
[47:16.42]So, I don't know.
[47:17.12]I think it averages out to like a B-78, 81.
[47:19.62]What about just streaming yourself taking a stroll through the forest?
[47:35.40]That's kind of, that's cute.
[47:38.42]Maybe I would put that in somewhere.
[47:41.88]And just, oh, what's that?
[47:43.50]What is this on this?
[47:44.80]Look at the moss, guys.
[47:46.18]Look.
[47:47.93]Would you unironically think that was cool?
[47:53.21]Yeah, I do live in Nevada, so that might be difficult.
[48:06.65]We're going to say yes to everything because we'll take anything.
[48:14.20]Oh, right.
[48:14.92]Okay.
[48:19.22]Alright.
[48:19.46]What is something that I know you would all not want?
[48:24.33]But if that's true, then you would be very excited for it.
[48:28.43]I might have to think on that.
[48:41.84]smite 2 that's another video game though I'm telling you video games I'm starting to have this realization about some video games is that I'll get in I'll lose the first like three games in a row and just get mad that I'm not good enough and I'll go I'm done I'm gonna move on to something else
[49:09.78]Especially multiplayer games.
[49:11.16]When you play a multiplayer game that has a lot of people that really play it, I'll just jump in and be like, alright, man, let's try this.
[49:17.32]What's this game called?
[49:19.52]League of Legends?
[49:20.46]I'll give it a try.
[49:20.92]Let's go.
[49:24.62]And then I'll like dive in my tower and be like, I can't, I can't do it.
[49:27.64]I can't do it.
[49:28.20]I'm not going to, I can't, I can't do it.
[49:30.98]And then I uninstall the game.
[49:32.85]Because I know that I, I know what I'm going to have to do.
[49:36.05]I'm going to have to really, really put time into it and try.
[49:39.01]And like really dedicate some time to get better.
[49:42.91]And then I go, I don't, I just want to eat mac and cheese, man.
[49:48.83]That's why anytime I watch people play games really well, it's like, damn.
[49:54.36]You know what you're doing.
[49:57.12]You know what you're doing.
[50:04.40]So you just sit in your room and do nothing?
[50:07.55]No!
[50:08.83]What?
[50:11.01]Wait, how do you get I don't play that many competitive multiplayer games to I sit in my room and do nothing?
[50:18.21]Because that's the only thing.
[50:20.63]That's the only thing.
[50:25.09]Or I may have just completely misinterpreted what you said because the chat was moving very fast.
[50:29.81]That could have been a vegan furry incident where I just read it completely wrong.
[50:41.72]So that's very possible.
[50:52.13]Everyone's saying, what?
[50:53.55]Everyone's saying, what?
[50:54.25]That wasn't even that long ago.
[50:55.31]That was like last year.
[51:11.22]Real ones, no.
[51:19.88]about Grotto Beasts oh yeah let me I've talked about Grotto Beasts in the I think pre-stream for a little bit but Grotto Beasts is currently getting a tts update there's going to be an update there's going to be some card changes there's going to be some new toys there's going to be some little additions um it's going to get a pretty I would say pretty pretty substantial update
[51:45.85]Because there are people that like it.
[51:46.79]They really want to play it.
[51:48.03]And admittedly, the last two or three months, I've gone back to the team and been like, alright, let's get this shit rolling because I want to get it out there.
[51:57.45]And then I get like really, really busy.
[51:59.73]And then it just becomes like a thing that is three rungs down on the priority list.
[52:04.99]But yeah, we've talked over the last month or two specifically.
[52:10.96]And there's been work has been done on it.
[52:12.60]So it's just a question of now getting it kind of out the door.
[52:16.00]It's just going to be free.
[52:16.72]It's going to be the TTS, if you don't know, Grotto Beasts.
[52:19.76]When you say busy, what do you mean?
[52:24.90]Busy.
[52:26.68]Busy with personal life, busy with work stuff, busy with crafting the perfect coffee.
[52:33.76]That only takes like 10 minutes, but I'm putting different things in different priorities.
[52:44.12]I got meetings.
[52:45.24]I got meetings at Off-Brand.
[52:48.20]We get in a call and we talk.
[52:49.62]We discuss.
[52:58.05]But yeah, the next time I am live, I'm going to imagine that there will be a very significant either time period or release period for when that TTS update will come out.
[53:09.54]But the designer has already talked about, like, hey, I've got, like, some pretty significant changes I want to do to a lot of the cards.
[53:20.14]So I'll give you some more when I have it.
[53:32.30]I actually was looking at a... I had a Bugleberry card I was looking at.
[53:35.86]And I was like, oh, yeah, cool.
[53:40.62]As a merch product, as a crazy, insane merch product, I still cannot believe that that happened.
[53:50.50]It was a joke that went from a parody to a joke to why don't we just do it for real to kind of a joke again to now you can really buy the joke to now we're going to do a TTS thing.
[54:02.55]And yeah, it was crazy.
[54:06.73]Crazy, crazy, crazy.
[54:14.07]Us Bugleberry fans are out there.
[54:22.25]Hey, yeah, you got one sitting in this chair right now.
[54:31.21]Hey, maybe Bugleberry will show up at some point.
[54:34.49]Who knows?
[54:36.01]Yeah, I wouldn't rule that out.
[54:37.45]Don't rule that out.
[54:39.37]Change your cam.
[54:45.64]By when you mean change my cam, you mean... See you next time.
[54:57.69]Wait, hold on.
[54:58.05]Let me see if it actually works.
[55:01.67]What about cologne and perfume?
[55:04.21]Are you done playing video games?
[55:05.55]No.
[55:06.80]I still play them.
[55:12.84]I still play video games.
[55:15.90]Just not at the kind of competitive level that I may have before.
[55:21.15]Oh, also, I want to talk about this too real quick.
[55:24.69]So the Archive channel, the Archive channel has just started.
[55:28.93]I think they just started yesterday.
[55:31.92]They are going to be doing restreams on YouTube.
[55:38.74]So the archive channel, they're going to be doing these not that frequently, maybe like once or so a month, once or twice a month, just to have that sort of chat can be there.
[55:48.04]For those of you that never saw some of these streams that, you know, there's a thousand of them at this point, maybe even more.
[55:55.33]Apparently it was, it was success, success yesterday.
[55:57.89]So definitely if you are into that, if you're into seeing some restreams on YouTube, go follow the archive channel.
[56:11.56]It was really good.
[56:12.46]I was there.
[56:13.26]It was fun.
[56:14.02]Yeah, that's awesome.
[56:22.96]Put some gameplay in the background.
[56:24.64]The next time I stream will absolutely be gameplay.
[56:31.01]It's going to be Elden Ring DLC.
[56:32.79]And I don't know.
[56:36.25]I don't know.
[56:37.07]Who knows?
[56:37.63]I might go live in a week.
[56:38.69]I might go live in two weeks.
[56:39.65]I might go live in a month.
[56:43.84]I don't got a schedule.
[56:44.66]I don't got a plan for you.
[56:46.96]But I will be around.
[56:48.88]I can assure you of that.
[56:54.57]Come back with the pizza one.
[56:57.11]Alright.
[56:58.09]Let me give you a joke.
[56:59.11]And if you think it's funny, I might actually do it.
[57:01.59]Don't cut out any of the audio cues or the music.
[57:07.00]And just instead of mac and cheese, it's pizza.
[57:10.96]It's frozen pizzas.
[57:14.70]Just keep the exact same timeline in the editing program and just put in pizza videos.
[57:20.81]That actually is stupid enough for me to think it's funny.
[57:31.08]No, but yeah, that's going to be it.
[57:32.68]I only want to stream for about an hour.
[57:33.74]I want to show that, hang out with you, talk with you.
[57:36.93]I'm still around, still kicking.
[57:38.27]Things are going well.
[57:43.55]And yeah, maybe you'll see me in the next few weeks.
[57:46.97]Maybe you'll see me as part of a different stream.
[57:51.46]You know, off-brand.
[57:55.88]Could be.
[57:57.52]Check it out.
[58:01.04]We know.
[58:05.30]Can you say goodbye and take care?
[58:08.39]Hey, take care and goodbye.
[58:10.37]I said it backwards.
[58:12.23]We've remixed it.
[58:14.64]Yeah, I hope you're all doing well.
[58:17.00]Checking in.
[58:18.70]Take care of yourselves.
[58:20.50]Thanks for watching.
[58:21.40]And again, thanks to everybody that sent me the videos for my stupid tikka masala routine.
[58:32.14]I got a lot of really nice, wonderful friends that if I just DM them and say, hey dude, can you send me this?
[58:42.76]Yep.
[58:43.68]Like without even a second thought.
[58:45.70]So it's really, uh, really nice, really thankful and happy that it was a fun little video.
[58:51.92]I had fun making it.
[58:54.07]I will update you soon.
[58:55.31]Keep your eye on the sus.
[58:57.05]Keep your eye on Ludwig's channel.
[58:59.45]I'm just going to say, I'm just saying I might show.
[59:03.87]Alright.
[59:04.31]I just did.
[59:04.71]You know what I mean?
[59:05.39]The speed running event.
[59:08.99]I'm going to do something there.
[59:10.43]There you go.
[59:15.33]Like, I gotta be really coy about this.
[59:21.19]I'm like that, though.
[59:22.23]I never like to tell anybody what I'm doing.
[59:24.69]I like it to be a surprise that nobody knows.
[59:26.75]It's my own fault.
[59:30.23]Alright, see you later.
[59:31.19]Thank you, everybody.
[59:31.99]Take care.
[59:32.73]I will see you soon.
[59:34.67]Goodbye.
[59:35.37]Hold on.
[59:41.22]I forget which button to press to show the cinema.
[59:47.69]Is it this one?
[59:48.11]I don't know which one it is.
[59:57.18]Nope, it's not that one.
[60:01.44]Hey, it's that one.
[60:02.14]Okay.
[60:06.63]Oh, shit.
[60:08.33]I haven't streamed in so long.
[60:10.35]I haven't streamed in a long time.
[60:12.19]This is my fault.
[60:15.03]Guys, I didn't even have...
[60:20.41]I didn't even have better twitch.tv emotes enabled until 10 minutes before the stream started.
[60:34.38]I have broken a lot of connected things, so.
[60:41.26]They're still broken?
[60:42.08]I'm seeing omega lulz.
[60:44.74]Oh, no, I'm not.
[60:46.12]Wait.
[60:47.42]Is it still not work?
[60:51.62]Is it still broken?
[60:52.73]I thought I fixed it.
[60:53.41]I don't know what I did.
[61:08.06]What did I do?
[61:08.72]I even like I reconnected it.
[61:12.45]I'll figure that out for Elden Ring.
[61:15.95]Alright, see you later.
[61:16.93]Thanks for hanging out.
[61:18.34]Hope you enjoyed it.
[61:19.58]See you later.
[61:20.36]Bye, bye, bye, bye.
[62:10.83]you
