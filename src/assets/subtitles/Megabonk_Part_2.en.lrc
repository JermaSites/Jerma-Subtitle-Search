[00:04.49]That game's hard.
[00:06.69]I also genuinely don't... Ow!
[00:10.39]Ow!
[00:12.45]My body!
[00:16.18]That's the first time I've picked up Tetris.
[00:18.38]And I know it's not Tetris-y.
[00:19.86]Look at the blocks.
[00:22.50]Since I was probably nine.
[00:29.73]But it's a lot of fun.
[00:30.59]The game is addicting.
[00:36.68]How do you go 40 years without playing Tetris?
[00:38.61]Because I played Tetris when it was new and got my fill of it back then.
[00:43.11]I don't need it anymore.
[00:54.22]A little bit of shpee.
[00:59.37]How about one round of Megabonk?
[01:02.19]That sounds good.
[01:02.89]I'll do that.
[01:03.87]One round of Megabonk.
[01:04.73]That's it.
[01:06.79]And then I'm out.
[01:15.02]Let's do it.
[01:26.80]Is this the fourth game played today on stream?
[01:29.15]That's kind of crazy.
[01:42.80]Alright, where was I?
[01:44.58]I was doing something.
[01:58.00]Okay.
[01:59.24]Megabonk.
[02:01.76]Did I get any new unlocks?
[02:05.06]No, we're just going for it.
[02:06.16]I'm going to be... I'm going to be Clank.
[02:18.68]Oh, this is a lot louder than I remember.
[02:20.30]Alright, let's go.
[02:24.46]Time to cook.
[02:35.91]What's this game?
[02:36.38]This is Mega Bonk.
[02:37.36]It's great.
[02:41.82]Attack speed.
[02:50.17]How about some shield?
[02:51.41]Why not?
[03:04.38]Good.
[03:06.81]It is like a 3D vampire survivor.
[03:09.13]That's correct.
[03:16.82]What does this guy do?
[03:19.00]shady guy.
[03:19.89]Oh, he sells legendaries.
[03:23.23]This game is dopamine farming sim.
[03:26.36]Yeah.
[03:27.44]You can say that.
[03:34.49]It's Tetris, but it's bullets.
[03:36.68]It's not Tetris.
[03:42.27]I'm going to do the bow and the gun.
[03:57.53]I'll tell you what's going to happen soon.
[03:59.05]We're going to have a SEGA CD week.
[04:06.86]I'm going to play a bunch of SEGA CD games.
[04:08.50]It's going to take more than a week.
[04:10.55]But the SEGA CD is coming back within the next 10 to 15 days.
[04:18.06]We've got a bunch of FMV bullshit to play.
[04:20.18]I cannot wait.
[04:20.90]I'm very excited about it.
[04:33.14]I'm probably going to revisit some ones that I played before.
[04:35.48]It has been almost eight years.
[04:37.74]I think it's worthy of redoing some of them.
[04:40.40]Not all of them, but maybe a couple of them.
[04:46.85]Hmm, health.
[05:10.14]Alright, I gotta find the boss.
[05:25.74]Are you gonna play the quiet man?
[05:27.32]That was not for the SEGA CD.
[05:30.39]That was for the steam.
[05:34.15]Video console.
[05:58.71]Alright, where's the boss?
[06:09.90]Good.
[06:11.22]Good.
[06:15.47]Regen or damage?
[06:26.10]Hey, don't read my messages.
[06:27.20]I'm a hate watcher.
[06:31.16]Wouldn't that make you want me to read your messages even more when you say, hey dude, like, fuck you and stuff?
[06:36.77]Doesn't that... I don't get it.
[06:43.88]Reflect.
[06:52.17]Hate watcher, not a rage baiter.
[06:58.04]Ha ha ha ha!
[07:06.31]There's different denominations of different types of hate chatter.
[07:11.02]No, no, you got it all wrong.
[07:12.68]Don't lump me in with those people.
[07:15.26]No, no, no, no.
[07:16.00]I just hate your fucking guts.
[07:18.22]I'm not one of those rage baiters.
[07:19.67]Don't even put me in with those people.
[07:21.37]Those people are fucking... Those people are animals.
[07:26.31]Those people are monsters.
[07:36.15]That's big.
[07:51.70]Alright, I gotta find a boss.
[08:06.64]Go back to the shady guy.
[08:07.70]I don't even know where he is.
[08:09.50]I don't remember where he even is.
[08:12.59]Where was the shady guy?
[08:18.76]Somebody down there.
[08:25.30]Who are you?
[08:28.41]Whoa.
[08:30.63]Uh, yep.
[08:34.12]Yep.
[08:34.22]Yep.
[08:36.31]I need double jump.
[08:37.15]If I can find it, it'll be huge.
[08:50.91]Yep.
[09:03.13]Good.
[09:03.25]Double jump.
[09:10.83]Uh, gold, right?
[09:17.88]Okay, I gotta find the boss.
[09:24.45]Or just get stuck in a rock, that works.
[09:45.00]Where's boss?
[10:03.04]Where's boss?
[10:12.00]You're going to play... I know I'm not a human again.
[10:15.23]I'm not in the immediate future.
[10:25.32]I'm going to play a bunch of the SEGA CD stuff.
[10:28.07]I don't know if the next stream is going to be SEGA CD.
[10:31.29]I don't think it will be.
[10:33.44]But maybe I'll do another run.
[10:45.99]Dude, where's this boss?
[10:49.25]That game was great.
[10:56.54]OK, I need more projectiles.
[11:02.27]More projectiles.
[11:08.80]But.
[11:11.68]The dev said they want to put you in the game.
[11:14.96]Think about what that monstrosity would look like.
[11:22.94]Dude, I cannot find this boss.
[11:29.43]Southeast?
[11:49.17]Uh oh.
[12:03.54]I don't see it.
[12:04.42]This is bad.
[12:15.77]I got a pretty good build too.
[12:16.88]I don't like this.
[12:21.47]I feel like I already went this way.
[12:23.59]That's not it.
[12:26.48]Shit.
[12:27.38]Uh-oh.
[12:30.47]Go towards the red wind.
[12:31.63]Oh, wait.
[12:32.91]Is that how you do it?
[12:34.45]I don't think I even... I don't even think I knew that.
[12:36.72]That's crazy.
[12:37.20]I didn't even know that.
[12:49.55]Okay, gotta get kills here.
[13:04.29]Excuse me!
[13:13.19]Uh, more damage.
[13:22.10]Hey, at least I'm in the air still, whatever.
[13:27.97]Alright, give me the rest of this shit.
[13:29.93]More.
[13:40.10]We're gonna get a shitload of levels right here.
[13:53.47]More damage.
[13:55.03]More projectiles.
[13:57.56]More projectiles.
[13:59.22]More damage.
[14:03.07]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[14:09.08]Good.
[14:09.66]Regen.
[14:10.10]Always good.
[14:15.87]More XP.
[14:17.11]I like it.
[14:28.54]I've never been here before as... Oh, I guess not as Clank.
[14:32.88]Alright, I gotta get at least to 5 minutes.
[14:34.89]Alright, do not get overwhelmed.
[14:56.01]I need to get to like a little 50.
[15:04.24]That's great.
[15:06.15]My HP is really low.
[15:07.37]I gotta get higher HP than this.
[15:19.17]Yep, there it is.
[15:19.77]Alright.
[15:20.70]Beautiful.
[15:23.00]Stay in the air so much longer.
[15:34.99]Quaker Oats guy?
[15:37.19]Could I be the Quaker Oats guy for Halloween?
[15:38.54]I could probably do it with the hair.
[15:41.48]Or the ship costume.
[15:48.81]There's only one person I could see dressing up as the Quaker Oats guy for Halloween and it's your English teacher.
[16:08.32]Okay.
[16:09.18]Well, there's the portal.
[16:26.01]I might get to tier 3 with this one.
[16:28.20]There's no bonehead moves and I'm good.
[16:42.73]I gotta get the bow up.
[16:43.49]The bow is really underleveled.
[17:08.97]Damage could be better.
[17:11.35]WAY better.
[17:33.42]Oh, be careful.
[17:34.74]Don't be an idiot.
[17:39.93]That's alright.
[17:46.00]Alright, give me a legendary.
[17:49.42]That's not a legendary.
[17:51.89]That's insane though.
[18:02.21]Do you have nightmares about going to conventions and being asked to be the sus guy?
[18:06.79]I would just decline.
[18:07.49]No.
[18:08.59]That's not a nightmare.
[18:09.26]That's me saying, no, I'm not going to the convention.
[18:14.40]A nightmare would be I get invited to go to a convention just to go to the convention and then they introduce me as the sus guy and they put that picture on a projector behind me.
[18:24.87]That's the nightmare.
[18:27.61]If you invite me to come as the sus guy, I'm going to say I'm not coming.
[18:31.54]See you later.
[18:38.78]Holy shit.
[18:39.72]There's so many fucking people.
[18:50.35]Turn that on.
[18:50.98]Come on.
[18:54.32]Oh.
[19:06.74]I have a lot of money.
[19:10.92]good it's always great to see an artist reject their greatest hit because it gets too popular uh you think that's the greatest hit
[19:41.43]I didn't even make that picture.
[19:42.90]I mean, I made the face into the screen.
[19:57.80]Good.
[20:05.01]I think I'm gonna spawn the boss.
[20:35.25]Way more armor.
[20:37.23]Wicked peso.
[20:39.84]Alright, I'm spawning the boss.
[20:42.18]It might be a mistake, but I don't care.
[20:51.90]Yeah, no one says that.
[20:53.10]I've never heard that besides in a movie or a TV show of somebody being a guy from Boston.
[21:05.64]That's 560,000 health, holy shit.
[21:06.90]I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it.
[21:38.48]Three minutes?
[21:40.86]I don't think I'm doing enough damage.
[21:42.95]Oh fuck, that's bad.
[21:57.36]And a swarm.
[22:07.49]That's possible.
[22:08.69]If I clear this, it should be alright.
[22:13.35]Uh oh, this is not good.
[22:17.14]That was bullshit.
[22:40.19]I'm in trouble now.
[22:45.62]Not enough damage.
[22:48.94]I guess more projectiles.
[22:52.74]Ow.
[23:09.04]I have to try to focus on the boss.
[23:12.32]That swarm just eats so many hits though.
[23:28.30]Okay, get over here.
[23:31.78]Whoa, not good.
[23:44.06]Fuck.
[23:48.45]Alright, well, this could be it.
[23:50.31]Yeah, there's no way.
[23:50.97]I don't have enough damage.
[23:59.69]A miracle has to happen here.
[24:13.95]Uh, shit.
[24:16.21]XP?
[24:26.58]More damage.
[24:33.23]Oh, I'm dead.
[24:33.79]Goodbye.
[24:35.75]Damn it.
[24:36.57]I wasn't going to do it anyways.
[24:37.51]I only had 20 seconds.
[24:39.66]I had like maybe 1 minute and 20 seconds.
[24:49.00]Alright, one more and that's it.
[24:54.91]Yeah, because I don't even have another weapon slot yet.
[24:59.69]Let me do one with a third weapon slot.
[25:11.35]No, I do have a third weapon slot.
[25:12.81]Oh, I'm an idiot.
[25:15.17]I thought I didn't have it.
[25:20.05]Boss Buster.
[25:23.05]That's good.
[25:31.17]Attraction.
[25:32.31]Pick up range.
[25:32.97]Pick up range increases distance from.
[25:34.15]Okay.
[25:36.44]Lifesteal.
[25:36.96]That seems amazing.
[25:48.41]And then golden sneakers.
[25:55.28]That's amazing.
[25:58.07]Alright, what's a quest?
[25:59.41]I need to do.
[26:02.75]Breeze 1000 enemies.
[26:03.69]I don't have the ice cube.
[26:11.42]OK, let's go.
[26:18.18]I think I'm doing calcium again.
[26:19.56]Calcium's good.
[26:21.91]Whoa, I unlocked a new place.
[26:24.99]Desert?
[26:25.49]Tier 1 desert.
[26:26.25]Let's do it.
[26:43.20]I like this one.
[26:43.80]It's nice and bright.
[26:54.97]Vinny is regretting you telling him about the coin flip game?
[26:57.61]Oh no, is he stuck?
[27:00.86]Is he trapped?
[27:07.58]How many flips is he on?
[27:20.16]He's on a thousand?
[27:21.28]Alright, well, he's got a long way to go.
[27:45.73]Electric shocks.
[27:48.71]Let's do experience.
[28:12.18]I'm excited to see the mini boss in this one.
[28:14.02]Is it cool?
[28:23.87]I almost just got killed.
[28:33.50]I'll do Axe, it's fine.
[28:51.46]These are cool.
[29:05.77]I'm gonna die.
[29:06.51]So much more experience though, so this should be okay.
[29:10.28]And money right there.
[29:10.74]Get that money skeleton.
[29:11.24]Come here.
[29:11.46]Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[29:36.13]When the ice blocks come down, it's bullshit!
[29:42.39]Dude, who is spinning my pieces?
[29:54.17]More experience.
[30:01.12]Oh boy, that's a scorpion.
[30:06.48]Oh my goodness.
[30:23.91]More jumps.
[30:28.83]More projectiles.
[30:35.78]Yikes.
[30:40.01]Whoa!
[30:43.56]Whoa!
[30:44.68]Whoa!
[30:47.60]Whoa!
[30:48.75]Whoa!
[30:53.81]I gotta kill this thing.
[31:06.05]I gotta move fast.
[31:06.77]This character, if you don't move fast, it does no damage.
[31:20.90]Come on, sneak in there.
[31:22.84]Sneak in there.
[31:25.25]Sneak in there.
[31:27.43]Good.
[31:27.79]Sneak in there.
[31:29.29]Good.
[31:31.35]Good.
[31:31.83]Sneak out of there.
[31:39.42]Open.
[31:46.83]Good.
[31:48.87]Okay.
[31:49.19]Yep.
[31:53.13]What does this do?
[31:56.03]Someone's a bandit.
[31:58.10]Oh shit, hope he's not hard.
[32:20.45]Oh shit, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.
[32:23.64]I wasn't paying attention.
[32:24.38]I was trying to see what he did.
[32:25.14]I was trying to see what moves he did and I got killed.
[32:35.41]Alright, actually last one.
[32:36.81]I'm going to do Sir Oofy in the desert.
[32:57.49]Get that sword up.
[32:59.28]I'm gonna do sword, aura, and chunks.
[33:01.98]If I can get it.
[33:22.26]Give me aura.
[33:40.00]No.
[33:42.91]I want aura and chunks.
[33:45.11]Only.
[33:52.16]Vinny just beat it with 800 fewer coin flips.
[33:55.40]He already beat it?
[33:59.32]What?
[34:01.03]No way.
[34:07.67]Well, that's good.
[34:08.29]He escaped the...
[34:11.36]The luck culture.
[34:14.28]There you go, chunkers.
[34:24.77]Good.
[34:36.29]I can get more of those things.
[34:37.31]Alright, where are we?
[34:39.27]Attack speed.
[34:52.36]Come here.
[34:53.38]I need whatever's inside of you.
[34:57.39]Good chunkers.
[34:59.19]Or lifesteal.
[35:00.15]Lifesteal.
[35:00.84]Let's get it built.
[35:12.91]Why is everybody high?
[35:24.97]Here we go.
[35:27.05]I want aura.
[35:34.98]I need more chunkers.
[35:36.02]I need chicken chunkers.
[35:37.89]I want chicken chunkers.
[35:55.58]There we go.
[35:56.58]Chunkers.
[36:12.20]I gotta move over here.
[36:27.08]Kill.
[36:28.24]Kill.
[36:29.00]Kill his kiss.
[36:30.63]Kill his kiss.
[36:33.25]Ladies and gentlemen, the potty ball.
[36:35.39]Let me tell you, the kill his kiss.
[36:37.69]Oh, fuck.
[36:51.49]He hasn't done that in a while.
[36:56.78]Yeah, when you pull the back of my... When you pull my string in my back... I have 25 sayings.
[37:03.97]That was one of them for a long time.
[37:20.36]Hard to hit him with melee.
[37:22.37]Without getting your face smushed in.
[37:25.25]Uh oh.
[37:27.56]That's bad.
[37:34.17]I'm poisoned too.
[37:40.01]No!
[37:44.12]Poison's gonna kill- I need health.
[37:46.44]I'm dead.
[37:51.56]Health!
[37:56.47]Health!
[38:01.09]There's health right there.
[38:06.50]No!
[38:10.41]There's too many monsters.
[38:19.44]Thank God, alright.
[38:20.80]Definitely want the lifesteal.
[38:26.91]More lifesteal.
[38:30.40]More armor.
[38:33.06]Do I even have any armor?
[38:45.75]Okay, we're back in business.
[38:46.51]Everything's fine.
[38:48.02]We're gonna relax.
[38:59.78]You guys are fast.
[39:05.68]Yeah, the Aegis is actually kind of good.
[39:07.63]How have I not used this before?
[39:26.70]Life steal.
[39:32.55]Life steal.
[39:50.42]A lot of champions right here.
[40:02.49]How much do I actually heal now?
[40:10.62]I gotta find the boss portal.
[40:30.81]Wish I had a magnet right now.
[40:35.48]That's massive.
[41:02.18]Thorns or no?
[41:04.74]Is that a lot of thorns though?
[41:06.16]It seems like a lot.
[41:10.01]That is a legendary.
[41:11.55]But 10 damage?
[41:12.33]That doesn't seem like very much.
[41:27.51]Shit.
[41:36.16]Oh my goodness.
[41:43.22]More attack speed.
[41:51.15]The lifesteal is insane.
[41:53.43]It's so much better than anything else I've had.
[41:55.87]Ever.
[41:57.50]It's incredible.
[42:08.40]I actually really need to find the boss door.
[42:29.99]This way?
[42:37.86]I'm looking for the red.
[42:38.68]Is it yellow in this level instead of red?
[42:53.07]It's still red.
[42:54.91]I don't see it anywhere.
[42:55.81]I might be in trouble.
[43:07.76]I don't see it.
[43:15.11]Oh, there we go.
[43:19.24]Where was that?
[43:19.72]Where was that pointing?
[43:20.88]I saw it.
[43:21.68]Right here?
[43:23.10]There it is.
[43:23.56]Okay, let's go.
[43:26.67]Lil Anubis.
[43:37.36]Come on.
[43:40.12]Give me the free hits quick.
[43:44.75]Oh, it's not going to be enough.
[43:51.06]Junkers.
[44:01.45]I think it's still doable.
[44:04.69]If I could see.
[44:20.44]Dude, that fucking lifesteal is crazy.
[44:30.39]No, don't lose it here.
[44:32.94]Alright, I got it.
[44:33.50]Nice.
[44:36.88]Here one.
[44:47.41]Saved by the lifesteal, honestly.
[44:54.09]How long can I stay alive with the lifesteal?
[44:57.34]I probably can stay alive a ton.
[44:58.36]100% lifesteal?
[44:59.48]I might be alright.
[45:04.75]Just get more attack speed and I'll be fine.
[45:38.35]I got plenty of money too.
[45:47.29]Alright, let's go.
[45:50.16]Good.
[45:56.39]More attack speed.
[46:10.20]holy shit oh my goodness I'm still here uh attack speed or more life steal leave now what do you mean leave
[46:39.12]Tier 1, if you don't go through the portal, you just survive until you die.
[46:41.93]Oh, yeah, I can't leave.
[46:45.99]Yeah, yeah, no, I can't leave.
[46:47.03]I gotta kill the big one.
[46:59.21]I got a big one.
[46:59.95]I'm almost dead, though.
[47:03.60]Jesus!
[47:04.30]Jesus!
[47:13.53]They want me dead so bad.
[47:14.99]I have 110% lifesteal.
[47:28.55]I'm going to get one hit by something.
[47:31.49]Look at all these achievements I'm getting in the top left.
[47:36.45]I'm getting achievement after achievement.
[47:41.68]Give me x10 silver, come on.
[47:49.22]The fall damage is going to kill me.
[48:02.36]More lifesteal or more attack speed?
[48:10.35]Or more sword damage?
[48:23.07]This is how I felt playing that Tetris game.
[48:28.30]This is what I felt like when I looked over a chat.
[48:40.66]How high can this go?
[48:41.58]OK, this is now this is cooked apparently.
[48:56.59]More Aegis, more Aegis.
[48:58.39]Come on, I gotta get to x20.
[48:59.45]Is anything higher than cooked?
[49:18.96]Oh, it's gonna drop.
[49:19.86]I'm gonna get hit by one thing and die.
[49:22.32]Oh my god!
[49:24.43]No!
[49:24.97]Get the x15, please!
[49:27.49]No!
[49:31.22]That was crazy.
[49:31.90]36 silver.
[49:43.32]Okay.
[49:45.74]It's six minutes?
[49:47.92]Damn.
[49:52.47]Okay, I got Bob.
[49:58.79]More, oh, that's good.
[50:09.16]That's good.
[50:13.56]Cool, I got ninja.
[50:23.81]Now I got Bob.
[50:26.87]Let's see what Bob does.
[50:30.68]Where's Bob?
[50:37.15]Is Bob not a character?
[50:43.09]Huh?
[50:43.19]Bob is an item.
[50:51.68]Every 14 units moved, summon Bob.
[50:54.68]Cool.
[50:56.29]I think I gotta get this thing here.
[51:02.10]Cool.
[51:04.73]Alright, that's going to be it.
[51:06.69]That was a crazy day.
[51:08.87]Have I ever played besides grab bag nights?
[51:11.66]Have I ever played four games for an hour or two each?
[51:16.32]I mean, it's not that the stream wasn't long.
[51:18.41]I don't think we've played that many games that quickly.
[51:23.45]But it was fun.
[51:24.48]Good to hang out with the boys.
[51:27.33]I'll see you guys next time.
[51:28.49]I probably won't be live till next week.
[51:31.46]I probably will be live on... I got some auto vet stuff and I've got my own vet stuff.
[51:43.33]The human vet.
[51:47.16]Maybe like Tuesday.
[51:50.54]I want to put some time into some of the other games that I want to play.
[51:55.83]Let's see if I can get the SEGA CD stuff going at some point next week.
[52:01.16]Maybe next weekend we'll do SEGA CD.
[52:05.11]That seems like enough time for me to get it already.
[52:11.36]I'll see you probably Monday or Tuesday.
[52:13.94]There might be a surprise weekend stream.
[52:16.03]You never know.
[52:16.95]But Monday or Tuesday.
[52:22.68]Thanks for hanging out.
[52:23.30]Thanks for watching.
[52:23.92]Have a great rest of your evening.
[52:25.66]Take care of yourselves.
[52:29.69]Goodbye.
[52:32.17]And good night if you are sleeping.
[52:36.50]And good morning if you just woke up.
[52:39.75]And good afternoon if you are, I don't know, where you could be.
[52:52.90]Can you please play the poke video?
[52:54.77]Hold on.
[52:55.77]We'll play the poke video.
[52:56.79]Fine.
[53:05.38]Let me turn it down.
[53:06.10]Hold on.
[53:26.75]Okay, let me, I gotta make sure this isn't loud because it's gonna be loud.
[53:43.90]So this is the crazy shit that Polk was doing on his stream yesterday.
[53:51.56]Hold on.
[53:58.19]Oh, hey, sorry.
[54:04.32]It's going to be really loud.
[54:05.50]I don't think I can change the volume of this until it starts to play.
[54:10.21]So let me see if I can catch it before it gets too loud.
[54:15.33]But I'm warning you right now, turn your speakers on for a second and we'll get it ready.
[54:30.56]Are you ready?
[54:31.40]Turn your speakers on for a second.
[54:32.54]This is so fucked up.
[54:58.23]The world is going crazy, guys.
[55:02.00]I'm just telling you.
[55:11.64]It's a Snapchat filter?
[55:12.90]No, it's way more fucked up than that.
[55:18.43]It feels like he just did that with a Snapchat filter on.
[55:29.45]Ugh.
[55:31.03]It's getting scary good.
[55:32.44]I don't even know what the fuck to tell you.
[55:44.27]Dude, if AI could, like, turn those data centers at least, if we're gonna fucking fry the planet like an egg, can we at least, like, cure a bunch of diseases with the fucking AI too?
[55:54.58]You know what I mean?
[56:08.52]Like, have all those GPUs figure out what's going on in our fucking blood system.
[56:29.44]LLMs are not the same as the AI in medical research?
[56:33.91]Well, let's hear- I want to hear about those!
[56:37.81]I want the AI medical researcher to do that video and explain to me while he's turning into a fucking demon all the things that he's doing.
[57:00.02]Medical research.
[57:00.92]ResidentSleeper.
[57:02.76]Memes.
[57:07.06]oh man 3D print yourself a Dr. pepper you need an exorcist you see the ones where he gets rejected from military service because his lips are too fat the whole like botox thing it's it's I don't even know what to say
[57:35.51]Like I said, it does, it does get funky when, okay, if you have everybody on Earth is all making meme videos of themselves and their friend groups
[57:50.93]Do you remember the statistic that YouTube used to say?
[57:54.18]I forget what it was.
[57:54.94]It was, that's right, everybody.
[57:57.46]There is over 100 million hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every week.
[58:04.59]It was like every hour, there's 10 million hours of it.
[58:08.00]It was a big thing that they said.
[58:11.18]What?
[58:12.52]What is this going to be?
[58:14.25]This is going to be like 700 trillion hours of people just going to be putting fucking Bigfoot like in a boxing ring with them and send it to the friend group.
[58:24.70]I really do wonder how many videos are made because YouTube used to talk all that.
[58:35.47]It's going to be hundreds of billions of videos that are going to be generated.
[58:41.21]And just from anybody.
[58:46.70]There's a whole new video platform just for AI videos.
[58:50.65]I always sit here and I think about what the next thing is going to be.
[58:55.06]Because there's others that have been here as long as I have in the online media content creator, YouTube, Twitch, Twitter.
[59:03.84]I've been around for a long time.
[59:05.54]There's others that have been for longer, but I think, what is it going to be?
[59:10.55]First it was, okay, you can upload YouTube videos.
[59:13.05]Okay, that's interesting.
[59:13.87]Now you can do a live stream.
[59:15.17]How can your internet even handle that?
[59:21.98]The next platform, could it actually just be AI videos with just billions of these everywhere?
[59:39.29]Dude, you already open up like the PlayStation Store and half of this shit is like AI fucking iPad games.
[60:02.61]AI is going through a lot of disillusionment.
[60:04.71]It's not going to stay popular.
[60:07.17]You never know, though.
[60:08.31]I feel like it... Okay, three or four years ago when we were talking about how this is crazy, this is fucked up, but I mean, it's not good.
[60:17.18]I think this is the first time that I've seen videos, like some of these jokey poke or whatever videos.
[60:23.51]They actually are good.
[60:26.93]It's not Will Smith eating spaghetti anymore.
[60:39.40]They're just burning money.
[60:40.24]There's no return yet.
[60:41.68]The second that somebody finds a way to make a return, really, which I don't know what that is.
[60:47.00]I have no idea.
[60:48.32]I'm not going to pretend I have the answers on it.
[61:01.32]The backlash will outweigh the novelty.
[61:05.42]I feel like it's going to go through a point where
[61:09.18]There's useful things that AI can do.
[61:12.82]And there's the crazy shit that AI can do.
[61:15.69]But the thing about AI, this is why I actually don't even know the answer.
[61:18.73]Because can't you just generate shit on your computer if you have a good enough computer?
[61:28.81]It's not like, oh, well, this platform is a platform.
[61:32.39]Can't there be endless amounts of platforms potentially?
[61:34.83]Because people can just make it on their computer and just have their own effectively data center in their house.
[61:45.43]You don't even need a super good computer either.
[61:48.79]It won't be good as a super powered data center.
[61:50.44]That's true.
[61:59.67]The Sora stuff requires like $10,000 GPUs.
[62:02.68]Huh?
[62:11.03]There's two things to say about AI, which is horrifying but interesting if you think about it.
[62:18.40]We have made so much shit as a species that we are able to train something on everything we've ever done to get to a point like this.
[62:27.39]That's fucking crazy.
[62:29.35]We have said and done so many things in the last hundred years that we're able to even have somebody do this in the first place.
[62:44.49]And record it too.
[62:45.87]Yeah.
[62:51.10]And now there's going to be, so think of all the things that it's already.
[62:55.74]I heard about this woman that recorded VHS tapes every day for 50 or 60 straight years.
[63:05.90]Every day she got up and she recorded it from different television channels.
[63:10.12]She would keep it going.
[63:11.01]It went 24 seven.
[63:12.35]She did it for almost 50 years straight.
[63:15.54]She actually trained somebody else to take over.
[63:18.72]And I think somebody else does it now.
[63:19.77]I think the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of whatever, of hours of footage, whatever it was, it went to the Internet Archive, right?
[63:33.95]But it's crazy to think that that
[63:39.79]Think of how much information is in there.
[63:42.59]And think about how much video files and how many pieces of AI video or AI art have just been generated probably in the last 40 minutes.
[63:53.39]It's getting crazy.
[63:56.27]And then the AI is going to eat its own AI, its own videos.
[64:02.12]Is it just going to keep learning on itself?
[64:04.34]Is it going to get stupider because it's getting, you know, Bigfoot versus the fucking Hulk?
[64:15.01]Is the snake going to eat its own tail eventually?
[64:18.53]If it just keeps eating itself eventually?
[64:21.25]Because if there's 500 billion hours of AI video and like 200 billion hours of real video that was made, eventually does the snake eat itself?
[64:35.33]It's already kind of happening.
[64:46.24]Engineers are already struggling with the water and electricity needs of AI.
[64:49.29]Yeah.
[64:51.35]And then you got the quantum computer stuff where it's like, oh, by the way, forget about this AI stuff.
[64:56.90]In like 20 years, we might be able to put what is effectively every NASA computer on Earth in a shoebox.
[65:06.51]It's like, wait a minute, bro, what are you talking about?
[65:15.10]This is not too deep.
[65:19.46]This is Ant-Man science.
[65:32.25]Dude, I'm telling you, like, we need, whatever happened to just bailing hay around?
[65:39.42]And like, hugging, and kissing your wife, and milking the cow.
[65:46.33]Here it comes.
[65:47.00]You can go in and fucking play Diablo II on your computer, alright?
[65:58.21]But the hay should be bailed.
[66:02.25]Ah, that was a nice day's work.
[66:03.63]We've milked the cow.
[66:05.56]We fucking filled up the wheelbarrow and we dumped it.
[66:10.22]And now it's going to be a nice three-hour session of Diablo II.
[66:25.23]Dude, I know, people give me shit for this take, and it's fine, it's mainly a joke, but like, I kind of wanted to like, stick a magical staff in the ground, like right after the PlayStation 3 came out.
[66:40.33]And that was it.
[66:41.49]You know what I mean?
[66:42.37]Once the PlayStation 4 came out, like stick the Gandalf staff in the ground and be like, alright, that's enough.
[66:48.39]The iPhone 5 is where we need to be, it's fine.
[66:50.65]We don't need any, we stick the staff in the ground.
[66:57.99]The Nintendo 64 has enough polygons.
[67:09.06]But we've made so much more progress because of being able to continue.
[67:13.43]But I look at some of this shit sometimes and it's like, whoa, the iPhone 17 is coming out.
[67:19.35]What the... Who fucking cares?
[67:22.80]Why?
[67:30.03]Let's solve some problems, you know what I mean?
[67:36.76]Okay, every new release of a new product, one of these companies has to solve a problem.
[67:45.42]You can only release the iPhone 18 after you've solved an issue with like Earth.
[67:52.36]You can make as much money as you want.
[67:53.96]You can make hundreds of trillions of dollars.
[67:55.60]It doesn't matter.
[67:56.25]You got to pick one problem in the world and your company has to try to fix it in like a few years.
[68:04.57]And then you can make the iPhone 18.
[68:05.73]You can make it fucking $15,000, whatever the hell you're going to do.
[68:09.10]That's fine.
[68:09.66]You could be a billionaire.
[68:22.82]That would just incentivize companies to make a problem they could solve.
[68:26.16]Shit.
[68:28.45]That's true.
[68:29.61]Fuck.
[68:41.89]That's already happening.
[68:50.14]Dude, I've traded cryptocurrency before.
[68:52.68]You know what I mean?
[68:54.02]I'm not the guy to tell you this.
[68:57.51]But I do gotta tell you.
[68:59.71]We're going down a road.
[69:01.55]And I hope it's a good one.
[69:16.63]It's gotta be a real one.
[69:24.46]Like, I'm not against making money.
[69:26.56]I'm not against people making money at all.
[69:33.29]But I feel like we kind of need to figure some stuff out, you know?
[69:38.80]It's crazy.
[69:39.66]It's funny.
[69:40.42]It's wild, this shit that we're seeing recently.
[69:42.54]It is unbelievable.
[69:46.57]But then there's, you know, well, we have to go fucking crazy.
[69:49.27]We have to go insanely hard because because China is going to go really hard, too.
[69:53.54]We got to go harder than them.
[69:54.92]They're going to go harder than us.
[69:59.00]We got to go.
[69:59.48]We got to go ten times harder.
[70:08.69]Did you hear about what they do in Europe?
[70:09.83]We got to go faster than them.
[70:11.54]Our Internet has to be faster than Europe.
[70:19.14]Centrist Andy strikes again.
[70:20.82]I'm not trying to say one thing and the other.
[70:34.12]I'm just trying to say that I watched some of this poke video stuff last night and me and Holly were laughing our asses off.
[70:40.82]But after two or three of them in a row, we would look over and say, this is fucked up.
[70:46.51]This is fucking crazy, dude.
[70:56.50]but I I'm curious what happens I'm curious what's the next thing what's the next platform what do people doing how are people making money how are people working in five to ten years I hope it's good for everybody I do he's got boomer brain rot stop trying to put rich people in a meat grinder I just told you I don't care people are rich that doesn't that's not that that's not what I'm saying
[71:33.15]It's because he's rich.
[71:34.91]Don't go out.
[71:35.51]Excuse me.
[71:35.97]Hold on a minute.
[71:36.83]No.
[71:51.39]We're at a crossroads where shit kind of has to change.
[71:53.41]Everyone is fatigued and broke.
[71:57.24]Yeah, there's a lot of wild shit going on.
[72:01.70]I'll just say that.
[72:10.29]P-L-D-R after all that.
[72:13.80]Do your best in a crazy fucking world.
[72:17.24]That's all you can do.
[72:19.17]Try to do your best.
[72:21.17]Sometimes the world is completely, the scales are literally weighted against you.
[72:27.96]But just do what you can.
[72:29.78]See if you can find something that you like to do.
[72:31.19]See if you can make money doing it.
[72:33.47]Have a few things that you like.
[72:34.99]Don't go all in onto one thing.
[72:36.34]Have three or four things that make you happy and do it.
[72:39.32]Try to get something done.
[72:42.97]It's not that simple.
[72:44.13]I know it's not.
[72:46.56]It's a very difficult fucking world right now.
[72:48.88]It is hard.
[72:51.72]I can't even imagine going into the workforce right now as a 20 year old, as a 18 year old, as a 22 year old, 25, fresh out of college.
[73:00.53]I'm just like, there's all this shit.
[73:01.97]It's very difficult.
[73:05.22]You can just like chat GPT and people are, wait, wait, did you cheat on that?
[73:10.28]I don't know.
[73:10.73]I didn't.
[73:11.09]Did you though?
[73:12.69]I read that first paragraph.
[73:13.73]It looks like you did.
[73:16.89]And then you, some people, you can just like type shit into chat GPT.
[73:23.26]Find three things that you really like.
[73:25.86]So you're never disappointed.
[73:31.47]That advice is literally from the G.I.
[73:32.97]Joe parodies from early YouTube days.
[73:36.09]What?
[73:36.35]Find three things that you like?
[73:42.06]I've been saying that for like a decade.
[73:48.68]Hobbies are important.
[73:49.40]Yeah, have hobbies.
[73:50.66]Get into stuff.
[73:53.20]Diablo II is a great game.
[73:57.47]We fuck around a lot here.
[73:58.43]99.9% of everything we say is do here is just for fun and a joke.
[74:04.72]But in the 0.1% chance that we talk about something.
[74:08.49]And again, this stream is always supposed to be just for fun.
[74:11.67]how it's been forever.
[74:13.22]But sometimes when something is very relevant like this, especially we've used the AI stuff before and had a grand old time.
[74:23.92]I'm not saying you can't.
[74:24.82]I'm not saying you shouldn't.
[74:27.89]But it is getting a little wacky.
[74:31.67]I'm very curious what happens next.
[74:42.52]Yeah, eat your vegetables, find a few things that you like to do, and have a fucking password of a vocal password with your friends and family members.
[74:55.86]And I know the old man is yelling at clouds.
[74:57.76]We're not there yet.
[74:58.96]No, we're not.
[74:59.90]And we may never be.
[75:02.04]But go eat a fucking, just go eat some carrots and some fucking onions and make a vegetable soup for God's sakes.
[75:16.42]Take care of yourselves.
[75:23.81]Good luck.
[75:24.98]Good night.
[75:27.08]And until I see you next time.
[75:29.04]See you later.
[75:34.37]Alright, this is where I put up the AI video of me, like, screaming, um, like, demonic things, and then end the stream.
[75:50.31]Alright.
[75:51.83]Rant over.
[75:54.11]That wasn't even a rant.
[75:54.89]We were just talking.
[75:56.32]Sometimes we just talk at the end of the streams.
[75:58.28]I'm not an expert.
[75:58.96]I don't know shit.
[76:00.44]I just know what my eyes see.
[76:03.13]And they translate that to my brain.
[76:04.75]And my brain probably translates it back the other way wrong.
[76:09.84]But it is what it is.
[76:12.34]We're just talking.
[76:14.56]Have a great night.
[76:15.14]Goodbye.
[76:16.02]See you later.
[76:16.43]See you next week.
[76:17.61]Good night.
