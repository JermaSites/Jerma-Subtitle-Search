[00:07.57]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[00:10.29]It's me, Demon Lord Xaraxos, here.
[00:13.43]You're probably wondering, where's Jerma?
[00:15.45]What happened to him?
[00:16.41]How come he's not doing this video?
[00:18.43]Well, it's because I have taken over his soul, and I will only release it after playing a round of Five Nights at Freddy's.
[00:27.23]Because everyone wants to see Five Nights at Freddy's.
[00:30.35]And who better than me?
[00:32.86]The lord of all hells and demons and hatred.
[00:36.82]I'm not scared of anything.
[00:38.14]What could I possibly be afraid of in this little shit game?
[00:42.62]I don't know.
[00:43.40]We'll find out very shortly.
[00:44.92]Let's go ahead and play a new game.
[00:46.20]Settle down your first night.
[00:48.56]I actually worked in that office before.
[00:54.12]This guy sounds kind of like an asshole.
[00:56.47]I'm gonna ignore him.
[00:57.73]Uh, let's go.
[01:00.71]Camera 4B.
[01:01.79]That's what we're on.
[01:04.13]Camera 5.
[01:05.43]Okay, 12 AM.
[01:10.42]There's a bird.
[01:12.82]I don't like birds.
[01:14.04]Okay, camera 1A.
[01:15.74]Camera 7.
[01:17.68]Put it down.
[01:25.17]Oh, there's a door.
[01:25.89]I can close the door.
[01:28.81]What the fuck was that?
[01:31.95]Okay, well, that was a little weird.
[01:33.39]That was like a bird in my face.
[01:35.61]I wasn't scared.
[01:36.71]I was not scared at that.
[01:38.20]I was just startled at it.
[01:39.52]It jumped up at me and it scared me.
[01:41.46]So, obviously, that'll scare you.
[01:44.06]I wasn't... Don't think that I was scared, though.
[01:46.36]Because, like, you were scared.
[01:48.14]I wasn't the one that was scared.
[01:49.30]It was you, actually.
[01:50.90]And you look... There's a blinking light over there now.
[01:55.73]Freddy.
[01:56.19]Oh, Freddy.
[01:58.65]Where are you, Freddy?
[02:02.05]You can't hide from Demon Lord Zaraxos.
[02:05.64]I will boil you.
[02:06.94]I will eat your flesh and tear off the bones and use them as toothpicks in my stew.
[02:14.62]If you think I'm going to be scared of your... One of them is missing.
[02:19.62]Okay, one of them is missing.
[02:20.82]Now, there was a rhinoceros that was here before, and he just ain't here.
[02:25.40]This bear might have moved.
[02:29.36]I might have seen him somewhere.
[02:31.28]I don't know.
[02:31.90]Pirate Cove's out of order.
[02:34.50]Let's just go back and make sure there's nobody potentially trying to kill me.
[02:39.85]But I will kill them first.
[02:41.39]That's what you need to remember from this whole thing.
[02:43.71]I will kill them first before they try to kill me.
[02:47.35]There is a guy standing there.
[02:49.37]There is a guy in a funny little suit standing there now.
[02:54.58]And I don't really know what to do.
[02:56.44]Should I... He's still there.
[02:58.22]Okay.
[03:00.08]I hear music.
[03:03.98]The night's almost over.
[03:04.92]I only have 3% power, so that means the cameras are all going to turn off, and we're going to all go to sleep, and it's going to be a nice, fun day at Freddy's Pizza Place Pizzeria.
[03:15.19]Right?
[03:19.61]What the hell is that?
[03:20.39]What the hell's going on?
[03:22.90]What the hell's going on?
[03:25.36]It's time to open the store.
[03:27.02]The pizzas are opening.
[03:36.12]Why would you work here?
[03:38.41]Who would work at an establishment where you could actually get killed by the people, the participants in the suits?
[03:45.89]I don't know why you would ever do such a thing.
[03:48.87]You come work for me.
[03:49.85]At least there's benefits down in hell.
[03:53.33]You know, you get a good dental plan.
[03:55.57]No, no, it's pretty good.
[03:57.23]You know, we're going to continue.
[03:59.21]I'm going to get past.
[04:00.24]I don't even know what the goal here is.
[04:03.26]I do not see him anywhere.
[04:04.54]Where is he?
[04:06.53]He's in the kitchen.
[04:07.19]He's in the kitchen.
[04:07.99]The son of a bitch is in the kitchen.
[04:13.00]That means... Okay, he's coming out here.
[04:15.66]Yeah, he's in the kitchen.
[04:17.64]No, he's in this one.
[04:19.04]Okay, now he's right here.
[04:20.78]He's gonna be right here.
[04:21.48]No, he's not right there.
[04:24.46]Where is he?
[04:26.32]Oh, he's right... Okay, he's right here.
[04:27.84]He's literally staring at me.
[04:29.76]It's 4 a.m.
[04:30.82]Don't let them come in.
[04:33.90]Do not let him come in.
[04:34.88]It's door locked.
[04:35.82]All the doors are closed.
[04:39.29]You stay where you are.
[04:41.11]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[04:45.07]None of that.
[04:46.59]We're not going to have any of that.
[04:51.42]Oh, boy.
[04:53.82]This is closed.
[04:54.60]We're at 4 a.m.
[04:55.42]now.
[04:55.78]Just got to get through the night.
[04:58.41]No, no, I got through the night.
[04:59.47]I did it.
[05:00.51]I was staring... I got through the night.
[05:02.28]This is... Come on, we won.
[05:03.34]I won the game.
[05:06.26]Did I not win the game?
[05:08.20]Are you telling me I didn't win the game?
[05:12.10]I was staring at him and he said, what the hell?
[05:15.52]Oh, boo, here he comes.
[05:16.99]He's gonna come.
[05:18.13]Oh, oh, boy.
[05:20.15]Don't get scared.
[05:21.01]Oh, oh, oh.
[05:31.02]You know what?
[05:31.54]I'm just... I'm just gonna go play Super Mario Brothers.
[05:35.12]Because that game... It's just... I don't want to play this anymore.
[05:39.28]Jerma!
[05:40.12]Jerma, your soul is now free!
[05:42.91]I'm releasing you.
[05:44.39]Why?
[05:45.39]Whoa, where... What happened?
[05:49.01]Well, just calm down, calm down.
[05:50.15]Everything's okay.
[05:50.81]Everything's alright.
[05:51.43]I have it under control.
[05:52.77]I stole your soul so I could come to Earth to play Five Nights at Freddy's.
[05:59.43]What?
