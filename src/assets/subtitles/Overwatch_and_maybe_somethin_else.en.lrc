[00:00.33]I think I'm still live.
[00:01.27]That was weird.
[00:02.79]I think I'm still live.
[00:13.84]Oh, I am.
[00:14.48]I can hear myself.
[00:22.80]That was a lot of French champagne.
[00:26.92]You see, I told you, I told you Twitch is like looking at me.
[00:28.96]They're like, oh, this guy, we're going to shut his stream down.
[00:41.30]My guy just disappeared.
[00:48.89]Yeah, I'm live.
[00:49.63]I'm here.
[01:02.41]But before we get started again, uh, before I get back into playing, uh, that was, like, thanks.
[01:13.07]I said before, I don't know how to ever react to things like this.
[01:19.00]I just like playing games.
[01:29.94]Keep subbing.
[01:30.88]Maybe they'll shut him down.
[01:32.24]Am I married?
[01:43.61]No, I'm not married.
[01:49.37]Not even close.
[01:53.51]Very far from it, I would say.
[02:06.85]Alright, 250?
[02:10.23]Well, last time it took like three minutes, didn't it?
[02:24.68]Am I not looking for a girlfriend?
[02:26.32]I don't know about that.
[02:27.64]It's... Whoa, what the hell?
[02:29.78]What the hell?
[02:30.98]It's just like...
[02:39.55]I'm not actively pursuing.
[02:42.01]I'm not actively looking for dates.
[02:44.85]If that's what you mean by that.
[02:48.79]Actually, I'll play... My emote's been used 2,000 times today.
[03:00.10]Previous max was 600.
[03:02.86]Well, a lot of new subscribers came in very quickly here.
[03:14.11]I'll date you if you're interested.
[03:21.64]I think subs can post links.
[03:24.68]I think so.
[03:26.58]They should at least.
[03:27.24]I think I changed that the other day.
[03:30.46]I'm fairly certain.
[03:44.18]First it was subs, now it's date offers.
[03:45.76]Where do I want to put this?
[03:48.76]I'll just put it over here next to the car.
[03:55.59]Right at the car.
[03:58.07]Somebody will turn the corner and die.
[04:05.82]feel the same way.
[04:07.32]Yeah, it's tough though, I mean, especially when you get a little older.
[04:11.36]Right?
[04:11.58]Like, I'm obviously older, right?
[04:15.81]It's not as easy as it once was to meet people, right?
[04:24.09]Because, I mean, I don't, like, go to the bar and, like, get, like, fucked up and... Hey!
[04:28.97]Hey, who's, uh... Oh, hold on a second.
[04:32.75]You know, you look beautiful this evening.
[04:35.97]I don't do that shit.
[04:37.68]I probably haven't done that shit in almost ten years.
[04:39.60]Oh, they already got the turret?
[04:44.42]Are you kidding me?
[04:52.07]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated.
[04:55.45]Loose Cannon Sandvich.
[04:57.75]That is a Team Fortress reference.
[05:01.22]Welcome.
[05:02.80]Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.
[05:07.04]If you don't go to school to have a 95 job, it can be tough.
[05:12.97]Yeah.
[05:14.43]It really can be.
[05:23.56]What, did it not repair?
[05:25.20]That's a load of baloney.
[05:30.19]That's not good.
[05:35.79]That's a lot of people that are hurt.
[05:38.45]Whose head am I on?
[05:39.89]Just use Tinder.
[05:52.35]I don't know.
[05:52.63]Tinder is like micro dating.
[05:55.31]Right?
[05:58.83]You just have like a little mini profile.
[06:01.92]I like this, this, and this.
[06:03.66]Take me.
[06:04.62]I think Torbj√∂rn might not be a good pick at the moment.
[06:09.72]Let's go up here.
[06:11.79]I'm going to put it up here.
[06:20.32]I'd rather know I share interests with people than have to go searching on the internet for it.
[06:26.45]If that makes any sense.
[06:30.55]But then how... There's the age-old question, right?
[06:35.53]How do you know somebody's interested in something if you don't even talk to them?
[06:39.16]I don't know.
[06:42.66]I just don't know.
[07:02.49]We do need to take that.
[07:03.27]Maybe that's what's going on.
[07:10.52]Are you lonely?
[07:11.26]No.
[07:14.08]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[07:16.32]Absolutely not.
[07:21.58]Get a billboard.
[07:24.20]That would be funny to have a billboard with your dating profile on it.
[07:28.71]It'll be a real funny jokester moment.
[07:37.98]I'm gonna get you.
[07:39.62]Gonna get you.
[07:40.18]Gonna get you.
[07:40.92]Gonna get you.
[07:43.48]I'm gonna get you!
[07:45.52]Maybe not right now, but I will eventually.
[07:52.13]Oh boy, we're getting destroyed.
[08:02.51]Make a YouTube channel.
[08:03.45]Get yourself out there.
[08:04.29]I have a YouTube channel.
[08:07.25]If you go down below, I have various links.
[08:09.81]And by various links, I mean one.
[08:11.15]It's my YouTube channel.
[08:16.61]I'm going to get some kills here.
[08:33.72]Pancakes or waffles?
[08:34.58]Neither.
[08:37.06]I don't like either of them.
[08:41.90]I don't really care about him.
[08:42.90]I care about you.
[08:43.52]Lots of pain.
[08:54.83]Lots of pain.
[08:55.89]Tons of pain.
[09:07.53]Something we gotta get away from.
[09:09.94]Dammit, the Mercy died.
[09:11.08]I just want to get rid of the Reinhardt shield.
[09:28.71]Bacon and eggs or bagel and sausage, bacon and eggs?
[09:33.00]Or combine them and have a bacon, egg, and cheese with sausage.
[09:39.15]Now that's... That's my language.
[09:43.85]Oh boy.
[09:44.31]Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye.
[09:46.69]Now I'm gonna lose this fight.
[09:51.45]I tried.
[09:52.73]I tried.
[09:54.17]Rage quit.
[09:54.63]Rage quit.
[09:55.31]Go.
[09:55.71]Quit as fast as you can.
[09:59.13]What other games are out right now that I can just load up and play?
[10:03.27]What are they?
[10:03.87]Let's take a look.
[10:07.11]I had a couple of good games with Overwatch, but... I'm feeling... I don't know, maybe I'm feeling something else.
[10:15.03]How do you snap your fingers and play the game at the same time?
[10:16.95]Uh, the game's pre-recorded.
[10:19.35]In fact, this whole stream is pre-recorded.
[10:22.54]Um... For instance... The... I was gonna say something about the games tomorrow, but I don't know who plays.
[10:41.77]Death to Spies?
[10:42.49]I'm not going to stream Death to Spies.
[10:48.65]I will sub if you played RuneScape for an hour.
[10:50.53]I know.
[10:51.98]I know nothing about that game.
[10:55.12]Excuse me.
[11:04.84]Slime Rancher?
[11:06.60]After this game, I'll take a look at the Steam list.
[11:12.77]See what's on it.
[11:17.93]I want to get a really good game.
[11:19.89]Because I do... My video... The next video I'm going to make is going to be talking about this game.
[11:28.47]And I'd like it to be Roadhog, so... Broken Age.
[11:36.38]I already played Broken Age.
[11:37.28]I beat it.
[11:42.92]Sports game like FIFA?
[11:45.28]A couple of my friends are really into FIFA.
[11:48.20]I'm just not a soccer, football fan.
[11:52.42]I used to love baseball.
[11:54.25]But nobody makes baseball games anymore.
[11:56.83]Except for Sony.
[12:10.55]Pac-Man Adventures 2.
[12:14.11]I'll take a look.
[12:18.23]Should I just play Steam Roulette?
[12:25.53]And just pick a random game that I've never even heard of and just buy it and play it?
[12:36.71]I actually was going to record this game and it was such a mistake.
[12:41.43]The game sucks so bad.
[12:43.45]It's not even that it sucks.
[12:44.39]I don't even know what the hell I was thinking I was going to get out of it.
[12:47.82]It's like Jim Rice's dog football.
[12:53.12]It's so bad.
[12:54.26]And I was thinking, oh man, maybe I could like play football with somebody with dogs and it would be so funny and fun.
[13:01.25]No.
[13:02.85]I recorded like 20 minutes and I was like, get me out of here.
[13:05.19]This is terrible.
[13:07.80]This is not good.
[13:08.80]Let's go around them.
[13:18.75]I don't think they even know I'm back here.
[13:23.12]Yeah, they don't.
[13:45.42]Jerry Rice whatever whatever his name is Jim Rice's football is baseball right
[14:04.45]No, they're gonna get that.
[14:09.65]Doesn't matter who I grab.
[14:20.68]Hug the wall, nothing I can do there!
[14:24.02]Ow!
[14:31.02]Shit!
[14:44.68]Shovel Knight?
[14:46.94]I think I already played Shovel Knight.
[14:48.42]I didn't beat it, though.
[14:53.58]I gotta have gold medals on everything this game.
[14:56.29]Even if we lose.
[15:02.07]Oh, Layers of Fear!
[15:03.75]That is true!
[15:04.57]Hey, get out of here!
[15:05.41]I'm trying to talk to my friends!
[15:09.23]Maybe I'll play Layers of Fear.
[15:12.08]Is it scary?
[15:12.60]Is that a scary game?
[15:14.44]Oh, I don't know if I like scary games.
[15:16.44]But I don't want to turn a webcam on right now.
[15:18.23]I'm having an ugly day.
[15:53.10]Did that actually just happen?
[15:56.90]He ulted me?
[16:08.24]Maybe I'll go up stairs and do my hair and come back and stream it.
[16:24.89]That's a lot of people hurting me.
[16:28.33]Did he die?
[16:33.33]He did die.
[16:42.12]Death becomes you.
[16:45.48]Bastion!
[16:45.92]I forgot they had a Bastion.
[16:55.27]I could have pulled him too if I just didn't forget.
[16:57.41]Yeah, I'll do a makeup tutorial.
[17:06.06]How I do my makeup.
[17:11.14]First, what you want to do is you want to get two eggs.
[17:18.13]Stick your face.
[17:18.67]Let's stick your face out.
[17:40.92]He almost just fell off.
[17:45.64]Ah, he's got a healer now.
[17:46.94]Whoa!
[17:53.83]Ah, I had one health.
[17:56.69]Not much I could do there.
[17:57.55]I was trying to cause carnage.
[18:05.97]Actually, I played all of SUPERHOT a few days ago.
[18:09.01]If we lose, we lost.
[18:13.53]Let me see.
[18:14.11]How much is Layers of Fear?
[18:16.15]Let me go do my hair.
[18:33.36]It's 20 bucks.
[18:38.31]alright hold on a second hold on a second do I have any money in my Steam account right now I'm gonna hold on I'm gonna make a straw poll and we'll see we'll see what the straw poll says straw poll
[19:13.80]Okay.
[19:15.02]Layers of Fear.
[19:18.56]Or... Steam Roulette.
[19:26.59]I'm gonna paste it.
[19:27.27]Hold on.
[19:47.95]Your poll has been made.
[19:50.23]Okay, so here you go, guys.
[19:54.65]Vote on this poll.
[19:58.73]People with mods can paste this a couple times, whatever they want to do.
[20:02.03]Go vote on that poll.
[20:05.51]It's either a Steam roulette or layers of fear.
[20:10.10]And how Steam Roulette works is I'm just going to pick a random game under, like... It doesn't matter what category.
[20:16.31]I'm going to pick a random game and buy it.
[20:19.61]So, while you do that... I spelled roulette wrong, did I?
[20:23.74]I probably did.
[20:25.34]I'm a fucking idiot.
[20:27.68]Alright, I'll, uh... Okay, I have some money in this account.
[20:41.82]Oh, boy.
[20:44.50]You guys want to see Steam roulette over layers of fear?
[20:58.40]At 69%.
[21:06.62]So what we're going to do is I'm going to go to random.org and do 1 to 26.
[21:13.04]Right?
[21:15.14]Because that's the letter of the alphabet.
[21:17.10]That's the letter of the alphabet that the game's going to start with.
[21:27.31]Well, early poll results show it looks like Steam Roulette's going to win.
[21:41.35]There's more possibilities.
[21:42.65]Yeah, but there's also much more possibility to have a terrible, not even fun game to play.
[21:55.04]Okay, it looks like that's what we're doing.
[22:02.17]That's what we're doing.
[22:14.38]That's what we want.
[22:15.36]Alright.
[22:16.75]Okay.
[22:18.73]Time to find a random game.
[22:23.03]The wheelhouse?
[22:26.59]Okay.
[22:28.09]I guess we'll use that.
[22:36.22]Spin the wheel to find a Steam game to play.
[22:38.64]That's what this is.
[22:45.06]Watch it be TF2.
[22:51.52]Are we, like, spamming this website right now?
[23:00.64]I can't go to it.
[23:04.49]I think we might be overloading this website if everyone's going to it at the same time.
[23:10.97]Come on, I need to find a random game to play.
[23:17.57]Solitaire.
[23:23.55]Nope.
[23:23.89]Hold on.
[23:28.65]Yeah, it ain't working.
[23:31.36]Winston, don't look so mad at me.
[23:32.74]I'm trying here.
[23:46.61]What's going on with my Chrome?
[23:52.17]Come on, Chrome.
[23:55.99]What the fuck?
[24:06.32]Well, it's not working.
[24:12.46]Oh, well.
[24:14.16]I was going to do what I was going to do.
[24:16.75]Random.org.
[24:19.73]Works for you.
[24:20.43]I don't know why I can't get it to work for me.
[24:24.93]126.
[24:28.19]The number actually that came up was 26.
[24:29.97]That's a Z. So the game has to start with Z. Okay.
[24:41.66]What games even start with Z on Steam?
[24:51.75]Do I like Steam change?
[24:55.67]Okay.
[24:59.29]It's going to be a zombie game.
[25:00.95]Oh, great.
[25:13.52]Okay.
[25:13.94]Any defined name.
[25:15.42]With a Z. Let's see.
[25:24.93]Zayers of fear.
[25:25.91]Alright, let's go.
[25:33.02]Let's find it.
[25:34.62]Here we go.
[25:38.92]Ladies and gentlemen.
[25:41.14]The game we're going to be playing.
[25:42.18]Oh, no.
[25:43.02]That starts with a T. Tales of Zestaria.
[25:50.48]What is this?
[25:54.47]No, this is gonna suck.
[25:56.75]I don't want to do that.
[25:57.63]Uh, what about Zemarian?
[26:09.46]It's apparently a shoot-em-up, top-down, classic arcade game?
[26:13.59]Zemarian?
[26:15.13]Is that what we're playing?
[26:25.84]Alright, that's the game we're playing.
[26:30.08]I don't know what the fuck this is, but I'm gonna play it.
[26:35.53]Add to cart.
[26:38.27]Everyone's like, no, no!
[26:44.22]Okay, hold on a second.
[26:56.27]I just have to buy it.
[27:00.61]Put credit card details on Steam.
[27:02.79]Uh... I don't think so.
[27:23.76]Samarian...
[27:28.45]I can't fucking believe I'm actually buying this game.
[27:34.20]Xenoclash?
[27:36.76]I think I actually already own Xenoclash.
[27:42.91]Xenoclash 2, isn't it?
[28:01.80]Alright, well, it's installing.
[28:13.65]Or is it?
[28:14.49]Or is it?
[28:18.45]Let's go.
[28:18.91]Am I using too much internet?
[28:27.94]Maybe my provider is like, you're using too much internet.
[28:30.40]We can't let you play this game.
[28:36.20]That like scared me.
[28:37.60]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[28:42.07]Awesomeness591.
[28:43.43]Thanks a lot.
[28:45.23]Welcome to the family.
[28:54.09]Maybe I will play Xenoclash after this.
[28:57.87]I don't know.
[28:59.33]It's getting late too.
[29:00.15]We'll see.
[29:03.43]We'll see.
[29:06.62]Zombies, monsters, robots.
[29:07.88]Actually, I gotta change my stream title.
[29:17.05]Does Twitch even have something for Zomarian?
[29:20.93]I guarantee it doesn't.
[29:30.77]Yadda yadda yadda.
[29:33.11]Okay.
[29:34.09]Change it to Zomarian.
[29:44.31]That's like how you spell it.
[29:45.34]I don't even know.
[29:46.68]Okay, there you go.
[29:49.70]Is that even how you spell this game?
[29:59.10]I apologize for the wait, by the way.
[30:00.76]Just trying to get it situated.
[30:10.04]You know how it is.
[30:12.32]You know how it is, my lovelies.
[30:14.64]Did I just call you guys my lovelies?
[30:16.32]That was weird.
[30:21.32]Okay.
[30:23.06]Let's open it.
[30:25.12]Close this.
[30:25.88]And... We need to go to our new Steam game.
[30:37.75]It's going to be loud.
[30:38.49]It's going to be loud, I think.
[30:40.59]I wouldn't be surprised if this was really loud, guys.
[30:47.61]So be aware.
[30:48.76]Please be aware.
[30:49.42]This is probably going to be very loud.
[30:52.16]Okay.
[30:53.84]Three, two, one.
[30:54.60]Here we go.
[31:03.84]Quarter Pounder Studios.
[31:04.86]I already like it.
[31:06.54]Quarter Pounder.
[31:10.28]Is there any sound in this game?
[31:24.44]Where's the sound?
[31:27.72]Continue?
[31:28.28]I've never played this game.
[31:31.74]Oh, Jesus.
[31:33.02]What do I have to do?
[31:35.46]Oh my God, it's so loud.
[31:38.18]Hold on a second.
[31:40.58]What are you doing?
[32:38.53]Oh, let's check out the leaderboards.
[32:47.29]I did it.
[32:50.13]Okay.
[32:52.74]Okay.
[32:54.72]I can't get out of here.
[32:59.32]Is there any... What a waste.
[33:13.76]Okay, now I'm gonna play Layers of Fear.
[33:24.88]I just fucking bought that game.
[33:27.68]I just bought it.
[33:28.34]I just bought that game.
[33:30.96]It's probably a good game.
[33:31.94]I don't wanna like trash it.
[33:33.38]It's probably not even a bad game, but I just went into it with a totally different...
[33:41.30]That was fucking cool.
[33:43.00]Zavarian.
[33:43.90]I recommend it.

[49:37.01]I'm gonna take a shit.
[49:43.49]These are headphones.

[50:09.71]Red Ranger 8.
[50:11.05]That's his 8th account.
[50:12.11]I got actually jump-scared by that.
[50:14.15]I thought somebody was yelling at me through the door.
[50:18.33]I hate having two headphones in.
[50:19.66]It fucks me up.
[50:25.18]Have a nice day, sure.
[50:31.40]Go up the stairs.
[50:34.72]That's kind of creepy.

[50:41.14]No, I did.
[50:42.08]Yeah, I did.
[50:42.72]It was Red Ranger.
[50:44.30]I just pretended like I forgot who that was.
[50:50.80]Do I have a flashlight?
[50:57.72]Play the piano.
[51:02.42]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[51:07.14]Fortress Final Queue.
[51:10.31]Thanks for supper.
[51:14.59]Don't even tell me I have to, like, actually play the piano.
[51:20.25]I hope not.
[51:20.89]Is this a puzzle game?
[51:22.55]This is not a puzzle game, is it?
[51:30.69]Whatever.
[51:35.29]Oh, you got me.

[51:49.67]He's got baby hands, too.
[51:50.81]This is a baby with a beard.
[51:53.45]I already know the... I already know the fucking ending.
[51:57.47]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[52:02.02]Left side of town, thanks to something.
[52:05.06]Welcome to the scream factor.
[52:08.44]That's a key I guess I need.
[52:09.68]It's a little red riding hood.
[52:14.19]It's telling me to turn... Oh.
[52:15.71]Ooh.
[52:15.83]Ooh.
[52:18.85]Oh.
[52:20.31]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.

[52:28.07]Welcome.
[52:30.65]This is Little Red Riding Hood.
[52:31.77]Is this being eaten?
[52:34.19]Or that's him eating the grandmother.
[52:36.59]This is getting really fucked up.
[52:41.28]Okay.
[52:43.80]Am I the wolf?
[52:45.50]That'd be really funny if I was the wolf.
[52:51.91]I've played enough horror games to know that that was going to happen, potentially.
[52:56.49]More of this nonsense.
[52:59.66]It's not nonsense, it's just I don't really care too much about it.
[53:04.35]Wait, is something in here I need?
[53:06.53]A notebook or something?
[53:08.10]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[53:11.14]Spruce!
[53:12.36]Welcome, Spruce.
[53:13.54]Welcome to the chicken hair.
[53:15.74]Welcome to the chicken hair clan.
[53:17.94]Everybody has to get their hair cut like this and look like a fucking turkey.
[53:26.97]Glasses?
[53:27.43]I don't think I need those.
[53:32.74]Let's just go.
[53:33.56]Scare me.
[53:35.65]Scare me.
[53:36.65]I'm looking for scares.
[53:37.57]What is this?
[53:37.95]I don't have a flashlight.
[53:39.61]I got a key.
[53:41.25]Go open a dumb door.
[53:47.97]What color is my hair?
[53:50.25]Brown.
[53:51.68]Brown-ish.
[53:52.22]I don't know if you can see.
[53:54.98]Look at a good hair shot.
[53:57.54]It's brown.
[53:57.98]Brown.
[54:04.52]Looks weird in this light.
[54:06.52]Looks like a different color.
[54:07.30]I've been working all night.
[54:13.80]Wake me up.
[54:24.01]Dumbling all around.
[54:25.15]Dumbling all around.
[54:26.19]Dumbling all around.
[54:27.23]It's so funny.
[54:29.61]Dumbling here and there.
[54:30.71]Dumbling everywhere.
[54:31.79]And I must declare.
[54:34.52]Turn it off!
[54:39.02]It actually turned off when I asked it to.
[54:40.46]Thank you.
[54:49.64]Galactus Grand Opening.
[54:53.35]Is there a person in this bed?
[55:00.75]Couldn't sleep.
[55:01.81]The leg's been acting up again.
[55:15.76]don't seem to be anything in here that I need so who cares what the hell am I supposed to do starting to get irritated alright that was ladies of fear guys it was a fun game you walk around and you look at things and there's no scary things in the game no I'm kidding
[55:41.84]Probably should pay attention to the notes that are on the ground rather than just walk around like a dumbass.
[55:45.22]Oh, there's something that's open.
[55:51.17]Can I pick it up?
[55:55.19]I guess not.
[56:00.19]Alright, it's a red coat.
[56:03.99]British military.
[56:05.43]Cool.
[56:11.92]I was trying to figure out how to get the fuck out of that.
[56:18.33]Okay, I apparently have a family.
[56:23.47]I guess.
[56:32.06]I got a dog.
[56:37.32]Come on, open it.
[56:37.80]I got a key.
[56:45.71]I don't think I can go that way anymore.
[56:47.20]We'll go back downstairs.
[56:48.36]Oh, maybe not.
[56:50.90]We don't go in here.
[56:51.48]There's blood.
[56:58.01]Really?
[56:58.99]Is there like a button I have to press to use the key?
[57:00.31]I don't know.
[57:02.95]Somebody tell me.
[57:04.87]Give me all the spoilers.
[57:07.28]Except don't really do that.
[57:15.98]Oh, this is a really good, um, opening of the game.
[57:22.98]There you go.
[57:28.46]I'm gonna have to paint something, I guess.
[57:39.57]Okay.
[57:44.79]Do I have to paint something?
[57:48.89]Where's my easel?
[57:56.31]You deserve it.
[57:57.37]Finish it.
[57:59.87]Okay.
[58:01.27]How do I finish the painting?
[58:02.21]I have to get different, various... A lot of locked doors in this game.
[58:11.48]What kinds of bottles?

[59:01.43]Oh, get it right this time.
[59:04.77]Get what right exactly?
[59:06.09]Is there more painting on here?
[59:11.19]Did I not?
[59:13.41]Is this going to paint itself?
[59:35.46]Look at me I'm smiling I'm having a good time just out of
[60:01.72]It's going to happen again.
[60:08.22]Turn the light back on.
[60:10.04]God, I don't want to... I just want to be, like, murdered.
[60:22.35]Can I do anything else in this room or do I have to just leave?
[60:24.01]I'm going to assume I can just leave, right?
[60:30.91]Wait, this is not the door that I just went inside of.

[61:50.99]Oh, please.
[61:51.45]You're going to lock me in here now?
[61:54.69]That's not cool.
[61:55.45]That means the code has to be in here somewhere, right?
[62:04.79]Is it written on the ceiling or something?
[62:06.12]Come on.
[62:07.80]Give me a break.

[65:11.59]It's actually kind of gross.
[65:17.57]Uh, where am I going?
[65:23.17]Can I leave now?
[65:23.73]I'll never forget.
[65:24.75]I promise I will not forget.
[65:26.03]Just let me leave.
[65:26.79]Thank you.
[65:29.17]Oh, that's fucking... That's my uncle's chair.
[65:32.89]I can tell.
[65:34.33]He used to shit his pants all the time.
[65:36.48]He had real gross green and yellow shit.
[65:40.36]It was disgusting.
[65:42.18]We put him in a home.
[65:47.52]That thing's gonna start talking to me, isn't it?
[65:57.51]I knew it was a baby too.
[66:13.90]Hello?
[66:21.45]Dust mice.
[66:22.87]Even in my lungs there's always more grotesque vermin dirt.
[66:29.19]Okay.
[66:30.65]Whatever you say.
[66:31.19]Is that a face?
[66:38.73]Holy shit.
[66:57.06]Who are these other paintings?
[67:04.21]I want to turn the gamma up.
[67:06.23]I can't really see.
[67:09.59]But that's the whole point, I guess, right?
[67:14.38]Oh, classical art man jump scare.
[67:16.82]Classic.
[67:17.56]They got me.
[67:18.06]What a classic.
[67:19.78]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[67:26.54]Blood Baron, thanks for the four months.
[67:30.72]Damn, man.
[67:31.86]That's a long time.
[67:34.43]We can be scared together.
[67:35.26]And I flip the switch.
[67:37.76]And I electrocute the dude that's in the next room.
[67:48.00]There it is again.
[67:49.11]It's gonna start talking.
[67:49.93]I guarantee you that thing starts talking.
[67:51.45]Guarantee it.
[67:51.87]Oh, there he is again.
[68:01.76]It's going to be like... This is a restaurant that has animals that talk.
[68:05.24]Oh, it's curing the baby.
[68:07.28]That's not cool.
[68:16.78]Oh, I'm being locked in.
[68:26.39]Oh, no.
[68:26.81]The presidents.
[68:27.87]The hallway of presidents.
[68:30.87]I just grew up in Cleveland.
[68:33.68]Wait a second.
[68:41.54]Oh, who's that person behind that is freaking me out.
[68:44.40]I feel like I need to squint and look at these.
[68:45.96]It's George Washington.
[68:50.57]I know that one.
[69:00.49]Don't throw things at me.
[69:03.21]Now, a tiny bit to the left.
[69:05.87]Yes, just like that.
[69:08.30]Hold that pose.
[69:09.98]I want to get all those lovely curves.
[69:13.28]What the fuck?
[69:14.54]I want to get all those lovely curves.
[69:17.30]Jesus.
[69:17.64]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[69:23.87]Middleman's, thanks for three months, dude.
[69:27.21]Appreciate it.
[69:28.85]So I paint my wife.
[69:31.25]She turns out to be a serial killer.
[69:33.51]She stabs me in the throat and takes all my fucking money.
[69:38.78]I'm not that round.
[69:40.02]Oh, I don't think you are.
[69:41.90]I never said that.
[69:43.18]Somebody in the game did.
[69:44.02]Okay.
[69:47.76]We looked at all the presidents of the United States.
[69:50.62]And now we're going to the super president, the ultimate president.
[69:53.96]Who's the ultimate president?
[69:54.84]I don't know.
[69:57.21]I'm just trying to... rat.
[69:58.99]Don't go in the fire, are you serious?
[70:01.63]Why?
[70:02.81]Why would you do something like that?
[70:06.00]No!
[70:08.02]How do I prevent the...
[70:29.81]Okay.
[70:32.47]That happened.
[70:34.66]I was too busy doing a rat joke to understand that I was going to get attacked by books from behind.
[70:38.92]I don't know how much longer I'm going to want to play this fucking game.
[70:56.43]I'm assuming I should look in here, right?
[71:05.06]What the hell is that?
[71:10.28]Should I just leave the room?
[71:11.10]I don't know.
[71:13.08]I hurt my leg on that one.
[71:14.39]Yeah, that hurt.
[71:29.58]Now I'm like just a ball of tension right now.
[71:37.90]I'm just waiting for the next book monster to come attack me from behind.
[71:40.80]It's locked.
[71:58.07]Is there a hairbrush?
[71:59.73]Okay.
[72:27.74]Mmm, I'm just I am so prepared for it this time guys.

[73:40.65]Where are these falling from?
[73:41.69]Is it a rat?
[74:00.54]What the fuck is going on right now?
[74:16.94]First, I looked for a canvas.
[74:20.84]Not just any canvas.
[74:23.90]Ah, the French.
[74:26.04]It scared me.
[74:29.00]Coltergeist.
[74:30.20]Thanks, what's that one do?
[74:30.88]So I used a razor, in fact, and then carefully flayed the skin.
[74:36.22]That's a piece of skin.
[74:36.90]Whose helped keep my hand steady?
[74:39.84]Is that guy Da Vinci?
[74:40.94]Didn't Da Vinci do that?
[74:42.74]Who did that?
[74:43.36]Who cut their, like, ear off and ate it?
[74:45.68]Did he eat it?
[74:47.22]Somebody cut off their ear and, like, ate it.
[74:49.84]And then, like, pissed in another guy's face.
[74:51.66]Who was that?
[74:53.04]Was it Da Vinci?
[74:54.96]It's creepy nonetheless.
[75:02.99]I can't even see.
[75:03.55]Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[75:08.27]I can't see.
[75:09.69]How am I supposed to walk down this hall if I can't see a damn thing in front of my face?
[75:15.57]Should I go out this door instead?
[75:20.57]Apparently.
[75:21.07]There's the rats.
[75:29.74]Oh, okay.
[75:30.04]I'm putting that piece of skin on here.
[75:31.60]You're thinking of Van Gogh and Mike Tyson.
[75:37.61]Well, it was one of them.
[75:39.47]Did Mike Tyson ever paint?
[75:40.43]Oh, is this full of mangoes?
[75:47.52]It's pretty gross flamingos.
[75:50.32]Ah, the fresh champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[75:55.05]Ofas!
[75:55.87]Thanks for something.
[75:57.29]Well, I gotta do this.
[75:58.05]This is... There we go.
[75:59.55]That was getting on my nerves for a second there.
[76:02.66]Thanks, Ofas.
[76:04.24]Ofas.
[76:05.96]Hey, a fresh champagne toast to Ofas.
[76:08.22]How about that?
[76:15.89]Where am I going?
[76:17.69]Shapeless dreams.
[76:19.59]I'll give you a dream.
[76:21.92]Next scare ain't gonna get me.
[76:23.54]I'm like, I'm gonna be a real man's man about the next one.
[76:27.09]Watch this.
[76:49.79]Let's go!
[76:50.23]Oh, it wasn't closed all the way.
[76:52.74]Whoops.
[76:54.51]Whoopsie daisy.
[77:17.37]I don't want to be on an elevator right now.
[77:18.79]I want to be getting feared in layers of fear.
[77:22.18]I want to be able to understand the storyline and have somebody yell at me and then have me go, whoa, whoops-a-daisy and clench up and flinch up like these games.
[77:28.96]Get me out of here.
[77:29.82]Let me get the fuck out of my way.
[77:31.59]Let's go.
[77:31.99]I'm unraveling the story right now.
[77:35.07]Alright.
[77:36.64]You divorced two years ago.
[77:39.26]She took a piece of your skin.
[77:41.10]And she... Left it on the fucking countertop.
[77:44.60]Okay, none of the doors work.
[77:45.76]So that means when I turn around, there's gonna be something behind me.
[77:47.53]It's gonna be the person that we just saw.
[77:49.73]Nope.
[77:54.91]The vase is weirdly out of place, though.
[77:57.61]There we go.
[77:58.19]Open door.
[78:04.04]I feel more comfortable if the door was closed.
[78:09.58]Get clothes.
[78:11.10]Nobody can sneak up on me.
[78:19.19]I can't even tell what these things are.
[78:20.45]Oh, there's a key.
[78:24.09]Ugh.
[78:26.69]Now that's creepy.
[78:27.55]See, I told you it was Abraham Lincoln.
[78:28.83]Look, he's got the top hat, the beard.
[78:33.57]The dead person that he murdered somebody, apparently.
[78:42.72]Which door does this open?
[78:45.90]Probably this one.
[78:59.35]Why did you stop?
[79:00.29]That tune was perfect.
[79:02.15]Honey, please, just a little longer.
[79:05.19]At least until I finish painting this one part.
[79:08.71]Oh, don't make me beg.
[79:12.92]Okay.
[79:14.68]Otto, what are you doing?
[79:16.76]Is he underneath my chair?
[79:18.46]My dog doesn't need to jump scare me.
[79:22.68]It's melting away.
[79:28.43]I guess I can't do anything else in here.
[79:33.15]No?
[79:33.49]Okay, let's go.
[79:37.19]No.
[79:38.19]Do you not know how to open a door?
[79:40.61]It's very fucking simple.
[79:43.29]I thought there was a door right there.
[79:49.01]That doesn't open.
[79:53.49]Okay, here we go.
[80:06.92]I ain't going in the attic.
[80:08.10]Are you serious?
[80:11.80]All that's in the attic is death and destruction and hatred.
[80:14.56]I don't even have my best suit on.
[80:23.40]Have to go in the attic.
[80:24.16]Okay, fine.
[80:24.88]Let's go.
[80:26.24]First home in a second.
[80:27.08]Let me just get prepared for this.
[80:34.19]Okay.
[80:40.80]The room underneath me was not on fire two seconds ago.
[80:48.02]What the hell is... Is it chairs?
[80:52.64]I don't know.
[80:54.56]But I'm not going to stick around to find out.
[81:04.27]This reminds me of P.T.
[81:06.33]This reminds me of... Why did my voice just go up so high?
[81:08.25]This reminds me of P.T.
[81:11.78]Walking around a house.
[81:12.58]There's a fucking baby in the goddamn cabinet.
[81:22.75]Baby in the fucking trunk.
[81:23.71]Of course you can throw a scary baby in the trunk.
[81:36.37]Can we go back to Zemarian?
[81:37.84]I wanna go back and play Zemarian now.
[81:42.88]I was less terrified back then.
[81:45.36]I was happier.
[81:50.28]Oh, my rat friends.
[81:55.00]You know, I'm less scared when the rats are around.
[81:58.54]I'm just gonna be totally honest with you.
[82:00.39]Okay, there's spatial audio in this game and I really thought it was thundering outside my house in real life.
[82:08.93]That's how good the sound design is in this game, I guess.
[82:16.60]I'm doing a lot of lip biting, too.
[82:18.88]I can feel myself being like... Why would you put a rat trap down?
[82:25.93]Are you serious?
[82:28.37]Those are our friends.
[82:29.17]Don't trap them.
[82:39.54]Back in the elk room.
[82:43.72]Or deer.
[82:44.20]I don't even know what the hell it is.
[82:48.98]Mastodon.
[83:00.93]That one didn't get me as bad as the first one.
[83:18.73]Okay.
[83:22.15]Oh, what the fuck?
[83:24.01]What the fuck is this thing?
[83:26.46]What are you?
[83:30.46]Oh my god.
[83:33.28]I'm gonna have a nightmare of that thing tonight.
[83:36.44]Literally tonight that thing's gonna be in my dream and it's gonna be I'm gonna be that person's eating.
[83:44.41]Oh.
[83:49.34]I don't feel well now.
[83:50.72]I don't feel well.
[83:54.17]Not that I'm sick.
[83:54.85]I just feel unwell.
[83:59.77]By the way, this stream is now right at R. I need a safe crack now.
[84:10.08]I don't know the combination, so no sense in trying.
[84:12.62]Might as well just keep going.
[84:15.12]I feel like I have seen that somewhere before.
[84:19.10]I'm gonna assume a lot of these are real paintings, right?
[84:44.45]I'm like just clenched right now.
[84:48.66]It's in the mirror.
[84:51.20]Well, I can't read it, so I'm sure I can read it.
[84:56.40]Of course you're going to walk through the mirror.
[85:00.02]It cannot be undone.
[85:01.02]It cannot be undone.
[85:01.98]It cannot be undone.
[85:05.38]So I'm in the second world, right?
[85:07.32]I'm in the other universe?
[85:13.30]I guess.
[85:15.17]I don't know.
[85:19.39]We're gonna go down here.
[85:20.72]I hear a dog.
[85:32.40]I don't like this.
[85:40.79]What happened to the funny games?
[85:47.00]We're the funny games I just bought us a dog It's always been celebrated for its excellence value size emu, thanks welcome to the Welcome to the good boys
[86:16.85]Welcome to the good boys.
[86:17.71]Thanks for something.
[86:20.69]What the fuck?
[86:22.71]Why did I want to play this game?
[86:26.25]It's right now.
[86:27.17]It is like 1230 at night.
[86:32.45]I live with a dog.
[86:34.15]I live with a fucking dog.
[86:36.36]I live with a dog.
[86:37.04]You're going to show me kind of imagery like that at fucking 1230.
[86:46.39]So it's just me and the dog.
[86:49.93]So we're going to be having all kinds of fun in about 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, you know, 30 seconds when I turn off the stream.
[86:59.23]What the hell?
[87:08.69]The stream roulette.
[87:09.83]Yeah, the stream roulette did win.
[87:11.51]But we did do the stream roulette and it was...
[87:15.75]I don't know if the word is a disaster or not, but it's either disaster, catastrophe, or it worked.
[87:23.17]Either way, I'm out $5.
[87:25.23]So, take it how you will.
[87:26.41]Okay, that's actually kind of funny.
[87:39.14]I'm trying to figure out whose eyes are whose.
[87:44.04]The middle one is the guy on the left side, I guess.
[87:50.30]Somebody's gonna be behind me.
[87:56.79]I really just don't want to turn around.
[87:57.95]I don't.
[88:02.27]I really... Okay, we're cool.
[88:08.27]I knew it!
[88:08.69]I fucking knew it!
[88:09.45]I knew it!
[88:09.85]I knew it!
[88:10.22]I told you guys!
[88:11.02]I told you I was gonna...
[88:15.75]I knew it!
[88:16.67]I knew it!
[88:18.15]Rats.
[88:18.37]I thought that was a bird.
[88:35.47]I thought that was a bird falling down and I was about to be like, why is there a bird here?
[88:46.04]You really gonna throw shit at me now?
[88:49.23]That wasn't even scary.
[88:50.19]It didn't even come close to hitting me.
[89:22.53]This door is open.
[89:25.15]I fucking hate you.
[89:32.53]Can't I just... No, turn it back on.
[89:35.26]Turn it back on.
[89:35.90]Turn it back on.
[89:37.02]Please.
[89:43.16]Turn all the lights on.
[89:44.20]Are we walking over here?
[89:52.30]There's no monster in this game.
[89:53.70]If there's a monster in this game, I am leaving.
[89:55.72]I'm going to hold down escape.
[89:56.92]I better not have to hide from a fucking monster in this game.
[90:06.93]I swear to God.
[90:08.57]I swear to you.
[90:24.01]It stopped.
[90:27.24]Or did it?
[90:28.10]Yeah.
[90:36.80]That's the paint monster.
[90:39.22]I already know.
[90:39.64]I already know what's going to happen.
[90:40.48]There's going to be a monster admitted to paintbrushes with a big easel for a face.
[90:56.83]Who's talking?
[90:58.29]Is that me talking or is that like somebody that lives with me talking?
[91:03.32]Who am I?
[91:03.66]I guess I can't pick it up so I might as well just go.
[91:29.60]It's not that door.
[91:30.60]Okay, well, if it's not that door, then... Whatever.
[91:39.23]I wouldn't want to live in this house.
[91:41.09]You couldn't pay me to live in this house.
[91:44.91]If you told me, Jeremiah, I'll pay you $500,000 a year to live here, I'd tell you to stick it up your ass.
[91:50.66]I would not live here.
[91:53.58]You could pay me $1,000 a minute to live here.
[91:57.73]I wouldn't even walk in the front door.
[92:00.02]I would say, take that money and stick it up your ass.
[92:02.68]I don't want it.
[92:10.72]Turn it on.
[92:15.24]Okay.
[92:16.68]Why is that not doing anything?
[92:17.58]What's going on?
[92:23.87]Oh.
[92:31.96]Just like a Jack in the Box, here it comes.
[92:33.30]It's backwards.
[93:08.05]Can I play it normally?
[93:13.63]Fallout.
[93:15.23]Just gonna hide in the corner.
[93:21.84]Oh, the bed's changing.
[93:27.46]Is everything changing?
[93:29.18]I needed a jar and a plastic tubing.
[93:33.29]I siphoned gas before I knew how it was done.
[93:38.10]I stuck the tube in a vein and sucked on it until blood filled my mouth.
[93:43.88]Then put the tube in the jar and it just kept coming.
[93:47.56]A taste of copper haunted me the entire night.
[93:51.73]Why didn't I think of a syringe?
[93:53.69]This guy's fucked.
[94:00.11]This guy's fucked.
[94:01.95]Something wrong with this guy.
[94:04.17]I mean, I'm just gonna say it.
[94:04.91]Something wrong with this guy.
[94:17.74]Anything else?
[94:24.30]I get to put the blood on the painting, right?
[94:26.50]That's how it works.
[94:40.14]That just made that even worse.
[94:42.14]What did I even do to this painting?
[94:45.52]It kind of looked like something before.
[94:47.04]It doesn't look like anything right now.
[94:51.04]Hate even now.
[94:51.82]Lost alone.
[94:52.48]You deserve it.
[94:53.30]A grave for you.
[94:54.28]Finish it.
[94:54.68]What the hell is this thing?
[95:01.54]Oh, it's a piece of skin that I picked up.
[95:03.86]Gross.
[95:07.56]Didn't I just pick up the other thing too?
[95:08.64]Why is that not here?
[95:12.13]Jeremy, you just don't understand art.
[95:13.77]No, I understand art.
[95:15.45]See, watch.
[95:15.95]See, look at this.
[95:18.05]I don't get it.
[95:18.53]Oh, another rat picture.
[95:35.44]Rotten seeds, I see the dirt movie.
[95:38.38]Rotten soil, nothing else grows in the dirt movie.
[95:47.38]It's your own scab.
[95:48.36]Is that me?
[95:59.26]Oh, please.
[96:01.22]Please!
[96:01.74]I knew it was going to happen again, but I still freaked out.
[96:04.94]There's no reason for me to freak out a second time.
[96:06.56]Something moved down here, right?
[96:18.15]We did it.
[96:23.84]I'm illiterate.
[96:26.02]I have trouble saying that word.
[96:29.62]I'm missing something here.
[96:30.74]What's going on?
[96:31.24]I can't go through this.
[96:32.68]I can't jump.
[96:36.39]So, what the fuck?
[96:38.09]You know, what the F?
[96:44.97]Is there a door here?
[96:51.62]I don't think so.
[96:52.27]What the hell is this?
[97:11.46]A creator's block?
[97:16.12]I'm stuck in a room now.
[97:20.11]Place your bets.
[97:20.75]What's gonna happen?
[97:28.43]Why do I feel like that wasn't supposed to happen?
[97:31.89]I feel like that was not supposed to just happen right there.
[97:38.26]Key.
[97:38.54]Give me the key.
[97:39.64]Ah, yeah.
[97:40.12]Okay.
[97:40.36]Goodbye.
[97:42.90]See you later.
[97:49.81]Smash the window.
[97:52.27]You tell me I cannot smash this window.
[97:53.71]What is going on?
[97:54.53]I'm in a different room.
[97:56.33]Am I shit-faced?
[97:57.75]What is going on?
[98:05.23]I gotta put on my glasses.
[98:11.26]Don't forget.
[98:12.94]Wednesday the 9th.
[98:15.82]June.
[98:16.18]Okay.
[98:17.96]Okay.
[98:27.24]Who wants to read?
[98:28.00]Wait a minute, that might have like... Oh shit, it's gone.
[98:39.61]Fucking knew that was going to happen for some reason.
[98:41.81]I could feel it in my bones.
[98:52.49]September 15th.
[98:54.87]Notes today even worse than before.
[98:57.09]The sad part is I agree with every word.
[98:59.87]More notes today.
[99:06.12]You're so confused, but you won't read the backstory.
[99:07.98]No, I'll read the backstory.
[99:09.56]Okay.
[99:24.45]Holy shit, that's a lot of books.
[99:28.47]That's a lot of the same books, by the way.
[99:30.57]There's like a hundred of the same book.
[99:41.70]I'm getting tired, too, which is even worse.
[99:43.43]I'm going to get even more scaredy-catted.
[99:47.19]Fools.
[99:47.71]Cretans.
[99:49.41]Simpletons.
[100:01.50]See, I'm having an ugly day.
[100:02.46]He gets it.
[100:03.52]Did he just call somebody a pleb?
[100:05.78]He just called somebody a pleb.
[100:07.26]A pleb.
[100:08.52]All righty.
[100:30.85]I thought that was like internet speak.
[100:38.67]Barnacles.
[100:49.06]Which door do I open?
[100:53.53]This one.
[101:02.53]Eventually I'll come back to... Oh, okay.
[101:04.37]I can go here.
[101:20.71]I haven't done it in a while.
[101:21.61]That's why I'm getting ready.
[101:22.39]I'm getting ready.
[101:38.18]Is that a telephone?
[101:40.35]Who's calling me?
[101:46.93]This is PT!
[101:49.08]This is the same- I'm doing the same thing I did in PT!
[102:18.65]Hello?
[102:22.21]Pick up the phone, please.
[102:26.11]Can I not pick the phone up?
[102:27.57]Are you kidding me?
[102:31.57]Oh, fuck it then.
[102:32.85]I won't answer.
[102:33.49]I don't even know.
[102:33.95]I don't even care who you are.
[102:49.83]What's going on?
[102:53.44]Who's throwing me the demon phone?
[102:56.26]That I can't pick up.
[102:57.52]Wait, hold on.
[102:58.14]What if I go backwards?
[103:01.68]Check it out.
[103:02.53]Watch this.
[103:05.51]Got it.
[103:14.28]Do I have to make one whole revolution?
[103:19.90]Yep.
[103:21.37]What the fuck is going on?
[103:22.41]It's down there now.
[103:42.41]Why was, like, Demon Lord Xeroxos on- I even saw that over here.
[103:48.89]Oh, hello, yes, who is it?
[103:56.20]Hello?
[103:57.38]Yes, speaking.
[103:59.24]What?
[104:00.94]What fire?
[104:03.84]Oh, God.
[104:05.48]Is she... Which hospital?
[104:09.42]I'm on my way.
[104:27.97]I gotta get to the hospital.
[104:33.58]Hello, who is this?
[104:35.70]It's me, Demon Lord Zaraxos.
[104:37.92]Calling to make sure that you do your homework tonight.
[104:46.39]A door.
[104:48.26]Get me the fuck out of here.
[104:50.58]Restless memories.
[104:51.66]Oh, restless memories.
[104:53.10]Oh.
[104:54.00]That's my favorite.
[104:55.96]It's P.T.
[104:56.62]It's fucking P.T.
[104:57.88]It's P.T.
[104:58.80]The same things are happening that happen inside of P.T.
[105:02.05]You open the door.
[105:02.99]The lady closes the door.
[105:03.99]Was there a painting in P.T.? ?
[105:17.56]Wait, the world's upside down.
[105:18.92]Hold on.
[105:19.22]I need a minute to think about this.
[105:20.22]Turn the light on.
[105:20.81]We're backside up.
[105:23.63]Oh, another rat.
[105:30.49]Oh.
[105:31.15]Flapping horror.
[105:32.15]Be quiet.
[105:33.87]Eating other rats?
[105:35.41]Constantly flapping?
[105:44.08]Nice face rig.
[105:44.84]We all know it's Zaraxel's.
[105:46.46]It could be.
[105:50.46]How long is this game?
[105:52.58]I feel like I'm like... Okay.
[105:58.31]Fuck you.
[105:58.73]Turn the light back on.
[106:07.38]I'm sitting back here for this one.
[106:10.48]Watch out for the ghost.
[106:11.50]Watch out for the spooky ghost in the drape.
[106:17.56]It's gonna do it to this one and someone's gonna grab me.
[106:24.54]Am I dead?
[106:43.28]You wanna have a hallway like this in your real house?
[106:45.56]You're crazy.
[106:49.55]I would avoid this hallway at all costs.
[106:52.96]I'm not even closing these doors.
[106:53.92]They're just slamming.
[106:54.76]Hope is the mind killer.
[106:58.00]No.
[107:00.46]Drugs are the mind killer.
[107:07.39]I guess we could go back up.
[107:09.81]Now we're going down again.
[107:21.42]Not gonna lie, this would be fun as long as I knew I wouldn't die or get hurt.
[107:27.02]I don't like being scared.
[107:29.38]I really don't.
[107:34.18]I like adventurous situations, right?
[107:39.17]But I don't like being scared.
[107:46.27]See, I'm adventurous.
[107:49.58]I'm a modern Lewis and Clark.
[107:55.40]I'm one of those conquerors that travels the seven seas.
[107:58.69]I'm just saying words so I don't get scared.
[108:04.69]What was that?
[108:13.50]Are we doing another PT hall again?
[108:37.01]How come no mirrors work?
[108:38.37]I can't see myself in any mirror?
[108:40.49]Seems odd.
[108:43.95]Splash some hot water in my face.
[108:55.13]Silent floaters, they clog the drains.
[108:59.68]No baths for me if we're in the water.
[109:04.30]Jesus.
[109:08.04]That's not cool.
[109:18.67]I just felt the game load an asset.
[109:23.79]I could feel the loading.
[109:25.66]So I know there's more things to be scared of here.
[109:31.44]Oh, shit.
[109:40.57]Alright, I'm gonna have to find a stopping point because I'm getting tired and I... You know what I mean?
[109:48.28]I don't know how long this game is.
[110:00.44]None of the lights even work.
[110:01.83]Why even have a house if the electricity doesn't work?
[110:05.21]Are you stupid?
[110:08.13]Oh, look, an empty room.
[110:09.01]I wonder if there's going to be a baby somewhere that's going to jump out and... Oh, a brick wall.
[110:13.35]Oh, hold on.
[110:13.81]Watch out for the brick wall.
[110:14.73]Watch out for the baby that's in one of these.
[110:16.29]Watch it.
[110:16.63]Here comes the baby.
[110:27.35]Okay.
[110:33.93]What on Earth is going on?
[110:37.34]And what I said about not doing drugs?
[110:39.40]This guy apparently does a shitload of them.
[110:47.59]Oh, shit.
[110:50.15]A snark... snarkastic.
[110:53.03]Thank you.
[110:54.59]Welcome to the, uh, group.
[110:56.75]Voted buddies.
[110:58.03]Friends.
[111:06.73]thought that was a hallway I thought look at this I turned that this going like this right that's a giant hallway with a statue at the end of it and then I saw the light switch and realized that I was completely wrong I've entered the forest temple what is this oh we're talking about zelda now what do you mean zelda
[111:41.97]Group buddy friends.
[111:42.97]Yeah, we're the group buddy friends.
[111:48.74]Here's the piano again.
[111:49.64]I'm getting, like, anti-gravity?
[111:58.48]Oh, God.
[112:06.21]I feel like I'm in Inception.
[112:13.60]Remember that part in Inception, guys?
[112:21.16]Can't really just push everything out of the way, can I?
[112:22.84]And find the secret.
[112:24.78]It's kind of like Double Dare.
[112:26.60]You gotta find the, uh, the flag.
[112:31.06]Oh, no.
[112:32.14]Here comes a monster.
[112:36.44]Here comes the monster.
[112:47.03]Am I supposed to stay in that room?
[112:49.71]Probably not.
[112:52.31]Going up these stairs so slow.
[113:05.08]Door is locked.
[113:05.94]Of course it is.
[113:07.74]Why would it be unlocked?
[113:13.96]What's with me and Double Dare?
[113:14.80]It's one of the greatest TV shows of all time.
[113:27.93]I don't like this guy.
[113:58.69]I don't.
[114:01.11]He's so scary.
[114:03.41]He's talking about grinding up bones and using blood for paint.
[114:08.91]You know what we do to people like that?
[114:11.15]We send them away.
[114:14.95]We give them the electric chair.
[114:17.23]You know, murderers, serial killers.
[114:21.94]We send them to the jail.
[114:24.36]And then they get electrocuted in the electric chair.
[114:29.26]But apparently he's just painting with people's bodies and cutting people up.
[114:33.46]Still.
[114:38.34]It's starting to look like something.
[114:43.83]Alright, guys.
[114:46.05]What if you fail?
[114:47.15]Well, I'm not going to have a chance because I'm probably going to go to bed.
[114:52.61]So we'll do PT, but not PT.
[114:55.23]I actually just called it PT.
[114:58.48]We'll pick this up pretty much where we left off.
[115:05.17]When I play it again, probably the next day or two, I would assume.
[115:10.75]Anyways, thanks for watching.
[115:11.65]Thanks for coming.
[115:13.16]There was...
[115:15.82]There was an absolute shitload of subscribers today, and I, like... It really threw me off, guy.
[115:21.76]It was crazy.
[115:22.84]Thank you, everybody, for all the support.
[115:25.10]That's all I can say.
[115:25.82]I love you all to death.
[115:30.42]And... You know, have a good one.
[115:36.45]You know?
[115:37.13]Have a decent one.
[115:39.77]Yeah.
[115:40.25]Good night, guys.
[115:43.43]We've got to end it with the dog.
[115:45.71]That's how you have to end every stream, right?
[115:52.51]Yeah, you can't even see him.
[115:53.33]I'll make sure you can see him before it ends.
[115:55.57]Hey, look at this, Freddy.
[116:10.44]Hey, look, there's a dog.
[116:11.16]Righto.
[116:14.11]Hey.
[116:14.79]Alright.
[116:16.15]Good night, guys.
