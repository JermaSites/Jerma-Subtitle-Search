[00:08.54]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.18]Jerma here with the 50,000 subscriber video.
[00:14.76]I really can't believe I'm actually saying that, guys, and before the video starts, I have to say from the bottom of my heart, I really truly mean this.
[00:22.48]Thank you all so, so much for subscribing, for supporting this channel, for doing everything you guys do, because it's half your channel as well.
[00:31.69]This is the germs here we're talking about.
[00:33.57]I might be Jerma, but you guys are all the germs, and it's...
[00:37.27]It's fascinating to see how much love is just spread around this channel, between commenters, between you and me, everybody.
[00:44.34]It's just fantastic, and I hope we can keep this going for a long time to come.
[00:48.64]And yeah, just wanted to say thank you so much to everybody that subscribed.
[00:52.04]Let's keep it all rolling, let's keep the ball rolling, guys, and let's start the party right now.
[00:56.90]So with any celebration, there's gotta be some type of party or something, right?
[01:00.25]Gotta be some type of interesting thing going on, and I want the cameraman to take a little bit of a pan down here.
[01:05.42]We've got all kinds of ice creams.
[01:07.51]Chocolate, Neapolitan, which is a mix of a bunch of things.
[01:10.11]I don't even know what the hell it is.
[01:11.49]Vanilla, sprinkles, maraschino cherries, chocolate sauce, a ton of whipped cream, a lemon meringue pie.
[01:18.96]What the hell is that doing at an ice cream party?
[01:21.51]And we've also got paper towels to clean our hands in the event of them getting dirty, which they will get very dirty because we're not going to be really eating any of this ice cream.
[01:30.93]We're going to make a giant human sundae.
[01:33.63]And who better to do that than Burgah Boy?
[01:37.47]So very, very important before we do this, don't try this at home because Burgah Boy is a trained profession.
[01:42.59]We've got to, like, make that perfectly clear.
[01:44.89]And what ice cream is good without a little bit of chocolate first?
[01:50.97]And I missed!
[01:52.21]Not this time.
[01:54.33]Let it commence, boys!
[02:05.02]Oh, this is going to be absolutely delicious.
[02:10.00]Oh my god.
[02:11.60]You must be so cold right now.
[02:21.56]I just hit her in the face.
[02:24.27]I'm sorry.
[02:24.85]I'm wicked sorry.
[02:54.23]Oh, man.
[02:55.85]Alright, so now that we have the ice cream in the bowl, we need to add a little bit of whipped cream because, of course, that's what goes on next.
[03:00.93]Oh, God.
[03:15.94]Oh, my God.
[03:23.17]You look like you're, like, just got hit by a landslide.
[03:28.43]Dude, this is ridiculous.
[03:31.31]So here's some maraschino cherries to top off this delicious sundae.
[03:36.88]Actually, you can probably drink that.
[03:39.42]It probably tastes good.
[03:40.56]And, of course, the sprinkles.
[03:41.96]I'm just taking the whole thing off.
[03:45.80]What am I doing?
[03:47.64]Oh, there's like a seal on it.
[03:50.86]How dare you?
[03:52.62]Let's put a seal on this.
[04:03.62]And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, my meringue pie.
[04:06.84]Oh, that's right, it's done.
[04:22.31]Thank you guys again so much.
[04:23.79]Burgah Boy, you're a great sport.
[04:25.91]See you all next time.
[04:26.87]And of course, take care, everybody.
[04:29.45]Time to hose me down.
