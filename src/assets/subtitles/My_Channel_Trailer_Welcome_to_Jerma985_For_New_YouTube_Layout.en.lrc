[01:20.01]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[01:24.09]Meet me at the statue at 12 o'clock, okay?
[01:27.00]I don't know where the statue is.
[01:28.38]I don't play this game.
[01:29.20]Oh, wait, I'm gonna bang.
[01:30.42]No, what?
[01:31.78]Oh, what was that?
[01:32.76]You were gonna bang?
[01:33.34]What?
[01:33.62]What were you gonna do?
[01:34.52]You were gonna bang me?
[01:35.30]Is that what you said?
[01:36.81]Oh, there we go.
[01:38.57]Oh!
[01:39.87]So of course, as Mario, you have to do all the dirty work because you can jump real high.
[01:45.99]Never understood that, by the way.
[01:47.62]Why does Mario have to do everything?
[01:49.58]He's like the savior of the world because he can jump higher than Michael Jordan.
[01:54.54]Left or right?
[01:55.54]Left or right?
[01:56.34]We're gonna go left.
[01:58.65]Oh, man!
[02:06.61]I knew it!
[02:07.37]I knew it was gonna happen too, and it still doesn't matter.
[02:10.57]What I'm talking about here is, you'll see it, I go like, almost like I'm sweeping the screen, not with my mouse, but with my A and D keys.
[02:19.54]And it's something, I don't know why I do this.
[02:21.48]And I think it's because I have a lot of trouble aiming with the mouse, more so than I do with just kind of getting people in front of my crosshair.
[02:28.24]But I kill every single person almost by doing the sway, in quotes.
[02:32.92]Cupid!
[02:35.62]You're gonna...
[02:39.85]Oh, now I'm dead.
[02:41.85]Who did this?
[02:43.78]Okay, I don't want to alarm anybody here, but I'm sorry I may have taken a shit in your house.
[02:48.62]Being one of the top 10 players in the world.
[02:51.90]That's right, this is Jerma's grandfather here.
[02:54.64]Not Jerma, he's not as good as me.
[02:56.54]He can't give you the tips.
[02:58.02]He can't give you the strategies that I can.
[03:00.47]So let me just tell you that I'm one of the best players in the world.
[03:03.95]And I'll show you right here.
[03:04.91]Look, I just kicked the fuck out of here, buddy.
[03:08.05]Let me tell you.
[03:09.57]Did I really have this in me the whole time?
[03:12.19]And the answer is yes, everybody does.

[03:17.21]You have it in you.
[03:18.05]You can, you can actually do it.
