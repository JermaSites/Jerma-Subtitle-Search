[00:08.26]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:09.82]Jirba here with Scare Saturday.
[00:12.62]It's Tuesday.
[00:13.92]It's Tuesday!
[00:14.62]I'm sorry, everybody.
[00:15.60]I know you've been waiting for the last couple weeks since I went to PAX for a Scare Saturdays video, and I have not been able to deliver that.
[00:22.85]And I could give you a bunch of excuses, but I'm not gonna do that right now.
[00:26.57]We're just gonna transition into the actual video of me playing Slender the Arrival.
[00:31.35]If you don't know what this game is, it's sort of a...
[00:34.18]graphical reworking of the original Slender game, the indie game.
[00:38.82]And this one is not free, though.
[00:40.50]This one is actually 10 bucks for the digital download.
[00:44.16]Link will be in the description if you want to go play it.
[00:45.92]It's pretty scary.
[00:46.82]It's pretty ridiculous, as you'll see in this video.
[00:49.58]So take care, everybody.
[00:50.42]I'll see you all soon.
[00:51.16]I think I say that at the end of the video, but it's okay.
[00:52.62]Here comes Scare Saturday, Scare Tuesdays, whatever it's called.
[00:54.42]Here we go!
[00:56.10]Dr. Pe- Wait a minute.
[00:59.24]This is a sprite.
[01:02.82]This is not a Dr. Pepper.
[01:04.02]That means we're already in trouble.
[01:05.74]Oh my god.
[01:09.32]That actually just scared the shit out of me.
[01:11.26]Okay, let's get started.
[01:12.08]Slender the Arrival.
[01:13.06]There's like a little intro here, too.
[01:15.22]I love how I'm just like skipping, like... It's cool how it has a counter in the top right, too.
[01:27.21]Tells you how long you've been playing for.
[01:33.43]Little pretty woods.
[01:34.35]Alright, this is daytime.
[01:35.25]This is nothing, man.
[01:36.53]If I see Slender, I'll kick him in the nuts right now.
[01:39.15]I got plenty of daylight.
[01:43.05]I'm gonna follow the path because it's the only thing here.
[01:47.20]Gonna skip down the path.
[01:50.80]Alright, I've just been skipping down this road for a couple minutes.
[01:54.44]And we're getting darker and darker and darker.
[01:59.18]Apparently in this universe, we go from day to night in like 15 seconds.
[02:06.50]It's like Super Sunset, what the hell is going on?
[02:11.68]Kinda looks like my house.
[02:14.54]Not gonna lie, that's even creepier.
[02:19.04]You flip-flop the garage and you have my house.
[02:24.53]Chairs.
[02:27.11]Pen, paper.
[02:31.92]Open.
[02:32.26]Another table.
[02:37.14]Some type of pamphlet.
[02:38.84]Honoring the life of Beth Hayes.
[02:41.05]Get out of your scrapbook and be viewed later.
[02:44.77]Okay.
[02:47.71]Ooh, the flashlight.
[02:48.81]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, baby.
[02:52.31]Blinding light.
[02:53.59]You don't really need that right now.
[02:56.89]Looks like a bed of some sort.
[03:00.25]Couple of vases.
[03:01.47]Vases.
[03:03.13]Vases.
[03:03.75]Vases.
[03:04.61]Can open the windows.
[03:05.57]Let's get some air in here.
[03:06.81]I just fought it.
[03:07.39]Is this a room down here?
[03:12.14]Unlocked the door.
[03:19.16]Can you see it?
[03:22.15]Escape.
[03:24.31]So I have to make it to, like, the... thing?
[03:26.81]This room is really freaky, by the way.
[03:29.57]It's all the notes.
[03:31.79]Alright.
[03:36.03]So... I have to escape.
[03:40.28]So there he is!
[03:40.88]There's Mr. Slender.
[03:42.56]There's, like, the thin man, whatever his name is.
[03:44.52]Alright, get me out of this room.
[03:49.06]To the woods!
[03:53.63]To the woods.
[03:54.67]We go.
[03:59.26]You don't have to scream, man.
[04:03.24]Go to the woods.
[04:06.60]And now there's drawings all over the wall.
[04:09.41]Let's go.
[04:12.43]Tent down here.
[04:15.51]Hopefully you're not sleeping, because I'm gonna come, like, open your tent.
[04:19.97]Don't look or it takes you.
[04:23.07]And it begins.
[04:25.01]And it begins.
[04:25.81]And it begins.
[04:26.53]Page 1 of 8.
[04:30.66]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[04:45.36]Abandoned house, it looks like.
[04:47.67]Let's get in there.
[04:53.43]I hate being in these enclosed off areas, though.
[04:55.89]Because this son of a bitch will just appear around a corner and snatch me up.
[05:06.30]Anybody on the dumper?
[05:15.88]Come on, there's gotta be a note in here somewhere.
[05:24.49]No.
[05:26.59]No, where's the note?
[05:29.69]Where's the note?
[05:32.69]Where is he?
[05:33.31]Where is he?
[05:33.71]Where is he?
[05:34.27]Where is he?
[05:38.28]He's behind me right now.
[05:40.58]We'll come back to this.
[05:42.40]I can't turn around right now.
[05:44.84]Wait a minute.
[05:45.22]Where is he?
[05:45.70]What's going on?
[05:46.50]Hello, sir.
[05:47.62]Hello, ma'am.
[05:52.40]Where is he?
[05:55.53]Where the hell is he?
[05:56.45]I can't even... I don't know... I can't see anything.
[05:58.39]I don't know where he is.
[06:02.35]Son of a bitch!
[06:05.21]You really screwed up my game here.
[06:09.25]Dickhead Slenderman.
[06:10.41]There's another note right here.
[06:12.83]I only have one note right now, and he's legitimately right behind my ass.
[06:17.01]Help me.
[06:17.47]Yep, help me is the real one, you should be saying.
[06:19.65]Me.
[06:20.23]Me!
[06:23.81]Oh my god.
[06:31.34]Don't turn around, just don't turn around.
[06:33.70]If I turn around, I die.
[06:34.78]Holy!
[06:43.37]God, he must be right up my ass!
[06:45.49]Whoa!
[06:46.39]No, he's right there!
[06:47.17]Oh my God!
[06:53.87]Is it up and out?
[07:12.47]I don't even know what direction I'm going.
[07:16.61]I'm stuck in a tree.
[07:19.85]No, go back.
[07:20.35]Keep going this way.
[07:20.99]Keep going this way.
[07:21.74]I do not want to run into that son of a bitch again.
[07:25.76]Man, they made like the noises and like the screen shaking and stuff so much worse.
[07:35.91]There, is that him right there?
[07:41.04]I wish I could just see my face right there.
[07:47.29]Oh, shit!
[07:51.91]Is there more than one?
[07:52.95]Is there more than one Slenderman?
[07:56.61]What is that?
[07:56.93]A light.
[07:57.43]There's a light right here.

[10:23.43]Well... Ladies and gentlemen... If you liked Slender... Slender the Arrival is like... A better version of Slender.
