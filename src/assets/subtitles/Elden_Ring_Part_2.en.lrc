[00:01.94]Somebody said, Jerma, please only stream for four hours today.
[00:06.14]What?
[00:06.42]Why?
[00:12.96]That's not enough time to beat the third boss.
[00:22.87]Gwendolyn the Gargantuan.
[00:27.47]Rerecorded.
[00:27.99]What even do I have to leave?
[00:29.65]I have to leave.
[00:33.39]Well... When you come back, we'll probably still be live.
[00:41.10]Anything less than 12 hours today is quitting.
[00:43.83]Uh...
[00:51.11]I can't agree with that, unfortunately.
[00:55.06]I've got one of those voices today.
[00:56.30]That's a radio voice.
[00:58.24]Because I talked a lot yesterday for about nine and a half straight hours.
[01:02.34]And I woke up today with what I would call something that would be a guaranteed gig for an early morning commute talk show host.
[01:14.96]Show us your eyebrows.
[01:16.74]Maybe I will eventually show you my eyebrows, but not right now.
[01:19.70]Right now we're going to talk about, um, Elden Ring.
[01:23.89]Is that Otto?
[01:26.43]Otto?
[01:27.27]Does he want to come in here?
[01:28.01]Hold on.
[01:29.21]You want to come in here?
[02:06.39]I opened the door and he just ran.
[02:10.13]He was like, let me in!
[02:11.33]And then I opened the door and he went, and just sprinted.
[02:15.13]Does that make me want something?
[02:16.35]I don't know.
[02:17.01]He doesn't want, he doesn't seem like he wants anything.
[02:24.41]Bring him back.
[02:28.79]I think he wants me to chase him around the house.
[02:33.51]Dogs are so weird.
[02:36.86]Hey, come chase me around the living room.
[02:41.08]I do.
[02:42.46]And we play, I run after him, and then he runs after me.
[02:47.02]One of our oldest, oldest games.
[02:53.67]What's with the pickle thing?
[02:55.37]Okay, are people trying to make a meme in Elden Ring?
[02:58.71]Right?
[03:00.49]That's what's going on, right?
[03:01.85]Oh, pickles.
[03:03.99]Pickled relish and shit.
[03:05.18]This is like an Elden Ring meme thing that's happening, I think.
[03:08.02]You should take CBD THC to play on extra hard mode.
[03:16.06]If I were to be high, I would not be able to play this game.
[03:23.59]Do you understand how horrible that would be?
[03:27.02]The stream would be an embarrassment.
[03:29.40]It would be embarrassing.
[03:33.13]I would be walking around and forgetting where I was, and I wouldn't even be able to fight enemies and shit.
[03:37.41]It would be impossible.
[03:38.13]What did you call last night?
[03:48.32]Okay.
[03:54.59]Like yesterday was an embarrassment.
[03:56.31]No, was it?
[03:56.98]I killed like four bosses and I explored the world and I immersed myself in the world and I walked around and did stuff.
[04:06.40]I got four boss progression.
[04:12.40]Your eyebrows were embarrassing.
[04:14.19]All right.
[04:15.47]Let's just, are you guys ready?
[04:16.39]Because I'm ready to play.
[04:23.04]Fought the same boss for four hours?
[04:25.70]No, I fought the same boss for like an hour and ten minutes.
[04:29.22]You can't, don't, don't gaslight me here.
[04:32.60]I played that boss for about an hour and ten minutes, and you know how I know.
[04:38.11]I went back, and I just checked on my VOD to see the exact time it took for me to beat that boss, and it was about an hour and twelve minutes.
[04:50.78]Just to make sure that I could defend myself if somebody ever said.
[04:52.96]Oh, yeah, dude.
[04:54.82]Just like you spent five and a half hours on the first boss.
[04:58.08]I can go.
[04:59.04]No.
[05:00.06]It was an hour and 12 minutes.
[05:01.72]Go back and look at the data.
[05:04.95]Did you eat another salad?
[05:06.75]No, I actually did not.
[05:08.81]So I might be playing at a little bit less power today.
[05:13.37]I did have a little bit of a snack.
[05:15.21]And actually, because I know I'm going to be going long today, I'm ready to take a food break somewhere in the middle, which will be a salad.
[05:27.40]I do have my green tea powder here.
[05:31.64]It's the thing that gives me my gaming powers.
[05:36.24]Oh, it's ready.
[05:37.68]I'm ready to go.
[05:42.77]Can you burp on screen?
[05:44.73]Maybe.
[05:46.54]Okay.
[05:48.28]Hello.
[05:52.22]How are you?
[05:54.56]Previously on Elden Ring.
[05:59.25]Do you have a Caesar salad?
[06:00.63]No, I don't really, I don't know.
[06:01.69]Ever since I found out that anchovies were in Caesar salad dressing, I kind of just don't want it anymore.
[06:08.36]That sucks, and I know.
[06:09.54]It's, like, stupid.
[06:10.22]Okay, I like anchovies.
[06:12.52]I like sardines.
[06:13.50]I like fish and stuff, right?
[06:16.55]But the fact that there's anchovies in a lot of, like, Caesar salad dressing, the combination of it kind of freaks me out for some reason, even if I know it's good.
[06:28.71]Like, if you put Caesar salad dressing without the anchovies here, and you put an anchovy here...
[06:36.56]I would be okay with dipping the anchovy in the Caesar dressing and eating it.
[06:41.40]But the combination to me is like, oh, I don't know about that.
[06:45.11]I don't know.
[06:45.97]Maybe I should bring that up to the doctor next time I see him.
[06:48.19]All right, ready?
[06:56.50]Why does it matter?
[06:57.68]It doesn't.
[06:58.34]And I still eat it.
[06:59.02]Look, okay.
[06:59.96]I gotta clarify some things with some people here.
[07:02.78]I think there's people here that think that because, like, ovens freak me out, that, like, I've never cooked in an oven in my entire life, and all my food, like, comes out of the fucking, like, of a bag in the refrigerator.
[07:13.49]No, I still use the oven.
[07:16.51]When I talk about the microwave being something that freaks me out, it's not like I hear the microwave turn on and run into a room and hide in the corner and go, like, turn it off!
[07:28.06]Turn off the microwave!
[07:30.00]I still use it.
[07:30.72]It's just kind of a weird device.
[07:32.02]It's easy.
[07:35.86]He's an admitted oven user.
[07:38.58]All right.
[07:43.83]Why does it freak you out?
[07:45.14]It's weird.
[07:45.54]It's like radio waves making your food hot.
[07:48.12]It's weird.
[07:49.14]I use it.
[07:49.80]I used it literally like 12 hours ago.
[07:52.12]But it's a weird device.
[07:53.00]Alright, what was I doing in my game of the year 20... What year is it?
[07:59.50]2022.
[08:00.70]It's not a radio wave.
[08:01.52]It's a microwave.
[08:02.06]Whatever the... I don't... It doesn't matter.
[08:03.69]It's still the same weirdness.
[08:08.31]I'm not going to get into this again because people will just leave.
[08:11.15]Alright, so what was I doing?
[08:12.43]Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[08:13.39]I was going this way.
[08:15.64]I was exploring a little.
[08:18.10]The magical world of Lindgrave.
[08:25.37]I did see that they made a post about all the PC problems.
[08:30.27]I saw how they were saying, oh, hey, yeah, we're aware that the frame drops kind of fuck everything up.
[08:35.17]And especially the big and bold, bright, bright green text.
[08:40.12]We are very aware of Dodge not registering on some German 985 PC computers.
[08:46.90]We're going to address this immediately.
[08:48.93]So I'm really glad that they actually addressed it.
[08:53.43]But actually, they are talking about it.
[08:55.51]So... Alright, I forgot that guy was even there.
[09:00.60]I gotta get back in the swing of things So what's down here?
[09:07.48]A bunch of explosive shit This is gonna be such a pain in the ass They're all gonna throw shit at me and it's gonna be annoying
[09:19.98]My hands are already sweating.
[09:21.58]I didn't even do anything.
[09:22.52]You know, no.
[09:23.42]I think this is sweat that's been here since last night.
[09:26.42]As disgusting as that is.
[09:27.74]I actually think... Because I just picked up like a... It's like the controller had olive oil on it.
[09:33.79]I think this has just been here.
[09:34.65]Because I didn't like... I didn't even clean it.
[09:36.59]Jump for the dive.
[09:49.48]What the fuck?
[09:49.90]Clean it.
[09:51.38]It's fine.
[09:52.00]Actually, it's really not fine.
[09:53.54]I'm actually probably going to have to wipe it down with this.
[09:56.05]We're good.
[10:00.93]Change your clothes.
[10:02.97]I'm wearing completely different clothes than yesterday.
[10:09.01]Controller Andy.
[10:14.59]How do you play these games?
[10:16.09]What's going on?
[10:18.97]Playing with controller is how, like, the way you play these games.
[10:22.37]Playing with the keyboard and mouse is hard mode.
[10:24.81]That's hard mode.
[10:29.55]Keyboard and mouse with... What?
[10:33.53]That's what... Actually, I would call that way too hard mode.
[10:40.82]That's not even hard mode.
[10:43.92]Okay, so we're keeping going here.
[10:45.10]Make sure I check the items.
[10:49.01]Remember, you're epic and you make me LOL.
[10:50.17]Alright, so I'm just going to throw a grenade down here, right?
[11:08.47]Wait, that was a pretty view.
[11:09.31]Let me look at it.
[11:12.83]Nice.
[11:13.81]Really nice.
[11:16.83]I thought that was a Statue of Liberty.
[11:19.99]I was like, that's kind of weird.
[11:23.12]You should jump off.
[11:26.12]I'm not going to jump off.
[11:27.88]Same joke?
[11:32.24]Elden Ring takes place in New York?
[11:37.44]Can you imagine just walking around and it's like, oh, look at this beautiful castle.
[11:40.56]It's so nice.
[11:41.46]And you just hear ambient audio of like... ... ... ...
[11:50.64]That would actually be kind of funny.
[12:02.07]Oh, thank you.
[12:05.31]Good try, though.
[12:09.23]And... Not just the cars.
[12:12.87]But for, like, every... Hold on.
[12:15.15]Give me a sec.
[12:20.45]Quintessential city background audio is not even cars.
[12:24.05]It's... With a little bit of an echo in the distance, like, every eight minutes.
[12:33.24]It's just, like, the truck backing up sound.
[12:39.52]Just that, like...
[12:48.07]It wakes me up every morning?
[12:49.25]Yeah.
[12:52.69]This truck... A truck is backing up and you wonder... Man, that... Wow, that truck's doing a lot of work.
[12:59.40]No, bro.
[12:59.98]That's like a hundred different trucks.
[13:02.42]In different places.
[13:05.44]It's like, oh, that's the same truck.
[13:07.12]They're doing a lot of work today.
[13:08.52]Nope, that's like 5,000 trucks.
[13:11.34]All in... Scattered around the entire city.
[13:14.68]And jackhammers?
[13:15.56]Yeah.
[13:16.96]Wait, did I miss anything here?
[13:19.71]No, it's just one truck.
[13:21.09]I always thought it was one truck.
[13:24.93]But it goes on all day, and I'd be like, why is the same truck backing up over and over and over again in the same spot?
[13:32.01]No, it's a different truck.
[13:37.78]Alright.
[13:39.02]Pedal down.
[13:41.70]Why does it keep leaning in?
[13:44.00]Dude, I'm a weirdo.
[13:44.74]I don't know.
[13:45.12]Like, somebody was saying yesterday, and I looked at the VOD, they were like, dude, you would probably be playing this game five times better if you stopped dodging with the guy on screen.
[13:54.60]And it's just like, you know, that's just what, I can't help it.
[13:59.44]I actually can't help doing that.
[14:02.92]It's going to happen.
[14:03.80]I can't stop that from happening.
[14:07.12]In fact, I don't know how people play these games just like, with a huge monster on the screen, and a bunch of crazy shit is happening, and they're just like,
[14:17.76]I'm under attack.
[14:20.06]I'm under attack when this happens.
[14:21.86]I don't know how you stay so calm.
[14:30.78]They're actual gamers.
[14:31.82]Okay, I'm gonna get killed out here.
[14:37.59]Alright, I can go down there.
[14:38.49]Wait, let's go this way.
[14:42.77]This is probably my favorite area of the game so far.
[14:48.62]I mean, I could just fall.
[14:49.82]I could just go and go for it.
[14:51.00]You know what I mean?
[14:53.86]I could go for it right now.
[14:57.66]Oh.
[14:57.78]Hmm.
[15:05.21]What's down here?
[15:10.65]I don't know what to do.
[15:14.86]I think I'm going to go with hole.
[15:15.80]Yep.
[15:17.84]I'm going hole.
[15:27.61]It's not going to hurt me, right?
[15:35.15]Oh shit, okay.
[15:37.43]Alright, so it's in here.
[15:38.23]Alright, I think it's an NPC right here.
[15:46.05]Yeah, my voice is going to be like this for like 15 minutes.
[15:49.17]Is that an enemy or an NPC?
[15:52.95]An NPC.
[15:53.21]Alright, what do you got to say?
[15:55.74]Ah, nice to meet you.
[15:57.88]The pleasure's mine.
[15:59.36]Roger is the name.
[16:01.14]A sorcerer.
[16:01.68]That's like a mushroom hat.
[16:03.20]You might have guessed.
[16:04.00]Sorcerer.
[16:04.60]I'm looking for a little something here in the castle.
[16:08.04]When I'm not hot-footing it from the troops, that is.
[16:10.85]But enough about me.
[16:12.91]What are you doing here in Stormvale Castle?
[16:15.75]Sorcerer Stu.
[16:17.33]Oh, boy.
[16:18.03]That's bad.
[16:19.39]They sacrifice our kind for grafting.
[16:22.82]Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind.
[16:26.81]Has he got, um... I'm here to defeat Godric.
[16:31.07]Did I say?
[16:32.28]What if he's a friend?
[16:32.98]What if he's friends with Godric?
[16:38.83]I'm here to defeat Godric.
[16:39.87]You're the only person that's doing a magic build and I love it.
[16:42.77]I think there's other people doing it.
[16:44.45]I'm not a pure caster though.
[17:01.92]I won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between.
[17:06.14]I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.
[17:09.30]Would you care to learn one?
[17:10.90]As a fellow tarnished, once guided by grace... A magical battle art?
[17:15.48]Oh my god, this could change everything.
[17:18.22]Yeah.
[17:24.96]Grants affinities and skills to an... Wait, what does this do?
[17:29.89]The Ash of War grants an armament the magic affinity and the following skill.
[17:34.00]Spinning Weapon.
[17:35.20]Defensive skill employed by carrion princesses.
[17:38.56]Lifts armament into the midair and makes it spin violently.
[17:45.24]Those it touches will suffer successive attacks.
[17:49.73]Useable on small... Okay, so this is like a magical spinning blade.
[17:57.59]Very royal prestige and body and skill.
[17:59.41]Transform blade into a magical greatsword.
[18:01.41]Oh, it's the swing.
[18:02.48]The magic swing.
[18:03.46]Ooh.
[18:07.60]One stone pebble.
[18:08.40]I already have this, though.
[18:12.64]Wait, what?
[18:18.05]Wait, this is a weapon art version of the one I already have.
[18:21.71]I think I want this.
[18:26.09]Yeah, I want this one.
[18:28.90]I gotta remember where this guy is.
[18:29.82]I will forget.
[18:32.07]You fucking bet your ass I will.
[18:34.27]I gotta get rid of the other ones.
[18:35.23]Look at all these.
[18:35.87]Yeah.
[18:36.23]I got so much shit on the map.
[18:40.53]Is there the markers?
[18:45.83]Is that one there?
[18:48.24]Okay.
[18:48.50]Yeah.
[18:48.74]I gotta remember where he is.
[18:49.56]Remember, you're gonna mauled hard in about 30 minutes.
[18:54.50]You know, you could probably say that at any timestamp in this whole stream, and you'd probably, you'd be right.
[19:00.45]You'd be close enough, probably, I would assume.
[19:03.29]Put it on the notepad?
[19:06.09]Oh, yeah, that's actually true.
[19:08.45]Very true.
[19:11.09]Okay, um... At...
[19:21.94]At one.
[19:23.26]At waypoint one.
[19:24.82]Has new spells.
[19:28.12]Alright, that's good.
[19:33.77]I have to be careful.
[19:34.29]I don't want to hit him.
[19:35.39]Okay, good.
[19:36.73]Alright.
[19:37.65]So that's where he is.
[19:38.39]I gotta remember.
[19:39.01]Wait, where's the marker?
[19:40.25]Where'd the marker go away?
[19:45.99]Alright, sorcerer in there.
[19:50.56]Can you imagine if this was the game fax for this?
[19:53.28]This is my game fax for Elden Ring.
[20:02.33]Oh, walkthrough.
[20:04.43]I'm just starting to do auto!
[20:32.98]This is, this, these are dog notes.
[20:37.49]If Otto knew how to read and write, this is how he would do it.
[20:40.03]Alright, what about in here?
[20:59.68]Will the guy in front of him hear this?
[21:04.61]Gorsh, I hope not.
[21:09.23]You... You got bombs, dude?
[21:17.41]Okay, run.
[21:31.16]Okay.
[21:33.87]I'm trying to hit them both.
[21:35.27]What did I just hit?
[21:35.85]I hit something else?
[21:37.61]Were there two people sitting in the corner?
[21:44.63]Oh, I didn't get... This is bad.
[21:47.89]This is bad.
[21:49.95]This is really bad.
[21:51.63]Yeah.
[21:52.11]I... Okay.
[21:54.57]I hit left.
[21:55.31]This is why... Like, okay.
[22:00.49]Hitting left on the D-pad to get the sorcerer's stick or to do the parry, I would have hit it.
[22:08.35]It's like I have four fucking items.
[22:11.79]I feel like the... I'm not going to get it.
[22:15.83]It's been 10 minutes, so you were wrong by 20 minutes.
[22:25.60]There's two guys sleeping in the corner.
[22:30.64]What?
[22:32.98]Did they increase the hitboxes in these games by like 500,000%?
[22:36.10]I feel like an action happens here and in like a four mile radius it actually hits.
[22:58.72]Like, that per- that- that beaked motherfucker right there threw a bomb at me.
[23:03.18]And it hit two other people in other games that are not even here.
[23:15.43]Just do it.
[23:15.69]Just kill me.
[23:16.15]Just kill me.
[23:16.52]Alright, I'm shooting this guy from far away.
[23:30.27]Somebody got punched in the face in that top tower, and my neck started to hurt.
[23:37.25]Fuck.
[23:37.77]Okay, give me my sorcerer's abilities.
[23:41.73]Oh, hi.
[23:42.35]I can do it too, you know.
[23:52.46]Really utilizing, like, the exploding barrels.
[23:57.79]There's the barrels.
[23:58.85]Barrels everywhere.
[23:59.58]There's barrels everywhere.
[24:00.52]I lost the souls that I had.
[24:01.68]Thanks a lot, Donkey Kong.
[24:26.93]Okay.
[24:28.41]Watch out.
[24:29.27]This is so far away.
[24:30.77]I was probably so close to a bonfire, too.
[24:32.25]That's so annoying.
[24:37.89]Oh.
[24:43.94]Oh.
[24:46.48]Alright.
[24:51.42]He's my favorite Sonic character.
[24:53.76]Um...
[24:58.99]Who cares?
[24:59.99]Who cares?
[25:01.63]Stop asking questions like that.
[25:03.27]Who gives a shit?
[25:06.25]It's fucking... It's Tails, I guess.
[25:08.75]I don't know.
[25:21.58]You know why it's Tails?
[25:23.85]Here's why it's Tails.
[25:26.39]You don't have any responsibility as Tails.
[25:28.61]Zero.
[25:31.04]Your friend gets to be the one that makes all the fucking wrong decisions while you just float around.
[25:35.44]It was awesome when somebody wanted to play Sonic.
[25:39.82]Because I would always pick Tails.
[25:41.62]Because I knew that that idiot that missed the jump, I was just kind of hanging out. ...
[25:56.85]Always player two.
[25:59.41]Yeah, Tails was the equivalent of what they did in Mario Galaxy.
[26:05.27]Where you could give somebody else a controller.
[26:07.57]And they could just be a little pink star on the screen and collect items for you.
[26:12.52]That's Tails.
[26:13.86]That's what Tails was.
[26:17.72]You're at 100 deaths?
[26:21.52]Okay, I need to pay attention.
[26:22.54]No more... I'm not speaking ever again.
[26:40.11]Okay.
[26:43.25]Uh, so there you go.
[26:44.10]My answer is that actually he's probably big the cat because he's the one with the fishing pole, right?
[26:47.82]Which is kind of cool.
[26:56.61]Alright, keep going.
[26:58.93]Who cares?
[27:01.89]I do, okay?
[27:04.35]I didn't even need to go up there.
[27:05.51]That was such a waste of time.
[27:06.41]Alright, no more fucking around.
[27:12.30]Wasn't really worth coming here, but this looks like it can break.
[27:14.15]Nope.
[27:23.13]Nothing.
[27:23.35]Okay, this is just the same place that I was.
[27:32.85]Sorcerous guy is right there.
[27:34.35]Why?
[27:34.71]Stop getting rid of my shit.
[27:43.18]Um... This looks... Okay, this is like a hand with like a magical spell on it.
[27:48.44]So that's what I'm gonna say.
[27:49.24]Have you tried the McPlant?
[27:57.57]Is it in America yet?
[27:59.45]I don't think so.
[27:59.93]And by the way, you're a McPlant.
[28:10.59]There's no way you don't work for that company.
[28:18.41]Oh, man.
[28:28.77]I fucking love McDonald's.
[28:29.79]I'm kidding.
[28:31.93]I haven't tried it yet.
[28:32.57]No, no.
[28:35.56]I'm really spicy this morning.
[28:37.52]Yeah, it's 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
[28:39.18]I know.
[28:42.52]Okay, these two... I gotta...
[28:50.29]Okay.
[28:51.11]It's gonna come down to catching him off guard and just doing cast, cast, cast, cast, cast, cast, and get him in like a bowling pin.
[28:58.05]Let's play bowling.
[29:05.74]Fuck you!
[29:12.78]What?!
[29:15.22]No way!
[29:18.41]Third time's a charm.
[29:41.51]Huh?
[29:42.13]What?
[29:42.55]Where were we?
[29:44.66]Did I fall through the map?
[29:46.14]I- Did I fall- I fell through the fucking map?
[29:49.12]What?
[29:51.86]Where were we?
[29:55.57]What happened?
[29:57.55]Alright, fuck this!
[30:02.03]I- Okay, I can probably make it.
[30:04.25]I just wanted to skip it.
[30:04.99]I can definitely make it.
[30:07.83]I know backing up in FromSoftware games is like digging straight up in Minecraft.
[30:12.17]I know, but like sometimes you have to do it.
[30:14.15]Otherwise, what am I gonna do?
[30:15.03]Dude, I can absolutely make that.
[30:28.08]There's no way I can't.
[30:28.86]I just have to get a little- I gotta go to the corner.
[30:34.32]He's the horse?
[30:41.92]I can't use the horse here.
[30:43.85]The horse is banned in Stormvale Castle.
[30:46.19]Let me just make sure.
[30:46.75]Let me take a look.
[30:49.81]I actually think this is possible.
[30:54.77]Right there.
[30:55.39]See what I mean?
[30:56.80]I think it is.
[30:59.70]Alright, it's not possible.
[31:00.60]Fucking whatever.
[31:01.66]It might be, but I'm not good enough for it.
[31:08.03]You need to run jump.
[31:08.83]It's hard to do, though, because you have to hold B. And if you touch B too early, you just dodge.
[31:14.99]So it's like, there might not be enough time.
[31:17.43]This is my last try.
[31:28.40]Oh, it's possible.
[31:29.02]Oh, yeah.
[31:29.38]Okay.
[31:30.22]Come on.
[31:30.50]Alright, it's possible.
[31:38.09]I just had to go a little bit more to the right.
[31:40.33]That skips that whole area too, so that's perfect.
[31:44.83]Okay, but counting these deaths as deaths is like... I'm experimenting with what I can do in the world.
[31:50.74]So I need to go like here.
[31:53.72]Like right to the left of the pillar there.
[31:59.28]Got it, okay.
[32:02.68]Now... What is that?
[32:15.34]Okay, so I can drop down there and just kind of go that way where these guys are going.
[32:19.16]I can skip those guys entirely, too.
[32:20.84]I don't need to fight everything.
[32:26.96]What's down there?
[32:27.52]Whoa!
[32:31.59]I mean, I kind of want to see what that is.
[32:35.63]What is that?
[32:39.69]Holy shit.
[32:40.17]Alright, I'm going to go see what that is.
[32:53.87]Oh, what?
[32:56.03]I don't think I have one.
[33:18.75]What's it called?
[33:19.25]Storm?
[33:19.81]Stone sword, not storm sword.
[33:24.30]I'm going to abbreviate this.
[33:25.78]SS key.
[33:32.12]How many keys does it need?
[33:35.22]Good question.
[33:37.92]I don't want to spend them, but how much does it need?
[33:41.99]No, it doesn't say.
[33:42.77]Okay, well, here we are.
[33:48.59]Obviously, something's going to happen here.
[33:53.02]There's no way... Okay.
[33:54.28]Just be ready.
[33:54.94]Be prepared.
[33:55.36]Because there's no way that like five people don't jump down after I touch this.
[33:59.46]It's too perfect of a spot.
[34:01.80]In fact... Smothering stone?
[34:12.87]No?
[34:13.12]Really?
[34:13.34]Okay.
[34:24.39]What the fuck is that?
[34:28.05]I can't go anywhere.
[34:29.39]I'm stuck down here.
[34:35.35]Is that his back or his front?
[34:37.03]I don't know.
[34:39.59]Is he looking away from me or is he facing this way?
[34:45.23]Oh, shit.
[34:52.03]Oh, that's his front.
[34:52.77]That's his front.
[34:53.37]Okay.
[35:14.07]I don't think I'm supposed to be here, but give me all the stuff in your house.
[35:17.59]I don't know what that was, but it's mine now.
[35:31.77]Oh!
[35:54.08]Oh, no.
[35:56.32]Don't call me.
[35:57.24]Don't call me a cheez-it.
[35:59.04]Don't call me a cheez-it.
[36:01.06]I mean, you can, but don't.
[36:04.90]I can't cheez-it.
[36:06.40]He's too quick, and I can't shoot him through the door.
[36:14.77]Oh, yeah, I can.
[36:22.05]Oh, that is some pure gruyere cheese, if I don't say so myself.
[36:28.30]Absolute pure delicious gruyere.
[36:33.70]Come on.
[36:34.92]Come on, you're dealing with a casual right now.
[36:38.35]Huh?
[36:55.09]Do not say that.
[36:56.01]Do not say that.
[36:56.83]Casual.
[37:00.14]He almost took my fucking head clean off my shoulders.
[37:03.22]Alright, just come over here so I can fucking... No, that's a really good breathe.
[37:08.60]No more.
[37:10.36]Why am I losing walk-on?
[37:14.37]I'm so good at fucking video games, man.
[37:18.58]Is it?
[37:22.86]Be careful.
[37:23.16]That guy killed me through a wall.
[37:24.26]Look.
[37:28.45]I am a battle mage.
[37:31.47]I have this claw, which attacks.
[37:35.55]But I also have the staff, which attacks.
[37:38.83]You're a bimbo.
[37:43.14]I'm playing the bimbo build?
[37:45.56]Is that what you're telling me?
[37:48.53]Is this bimbo build?
[37:51.13]Where what?
[37:51.64]Like I get to hang back and cast spells and only need to use my weapon if I absolutely need to?
[38:05.48]Oh, okay.
[38:06.60]I said this last night and I'll say it again.
[38:08.96]Sorcery works really well until it doesn't.
[38:13.79]And we might find out really soon enough here the places where it doesn't.
[38:19.46]Oh, it's getting auto-modded.
[38:23.57]Sorcery works great until it don't.
[38:35.13]Sorcery is going to fall off real hard in the next probably couple of hours.
[38:39.36]From what I've been told.
[38:40.30]This is a cringe build.
[38:48.05]Can we bring back the guy that said that, like, I'm one of the only people playing a sorcery build?
[38:52.37]Where is that person?
[38:53.27]Can you come back and can you, like, say what you said, like, five more times?
[39:03.34]I'm building decks and I'm building sorcery.
[39:07.06]As it stands right now.
[39:08.32]Oh!
[39:12.27]As it stands right now, my sorcery does more damage than my dexterity attacks.
[39:17.74]Therefore, I'm going to continue to use it until the dexterity takes it over.
[39:20.72]It's a very simple equation.
[39:25.16]Very easy.
[39:25.98]Simple.
[39:26.28]Can I talk?
[39:36.95]Doesn't open from this side.
[39:41.90]Uh, I'm in trouble here.
[39:47.55]I think I have to sneak by this person and try to find a bonfire.
[39:51.15]Which I'm going to think is probably over there.
[39:52.57]Alright, two schools of thought here.
[39:56.34]Run straight through there and just sprint into that build.
[39:59.22]Sprint in there and just run until I find a fire.
[40:01.66]Or sneak around.
[40:09.91]You think it's run?
[40:11.91]I think it's sneak.
[40:12.53]I'm going to wait until his back turns.
[40:14.09]But I can't run sneak because people hear it.
[40:17.19]When he goes this way, I'm going to go that way.
[40:19.54]One, two, three.
[40:37.33]Let's kill him.
[40:41.07]Excuse me?
[40:43.53]What?
[40:44.91]You gotta be kidding me.
[40:45.63]How did he fucking hear me?
[40:48.14]Just give me whatever's in your house, quick.
[40:52.84]Whoa!
[41:02.25]Fire?
[41:02.53]Is there fire in here?
[41:04.45]I need a fire.
[41:06.57]Thank god he de-aggroed.
[41:14.80]I need a fire.
[41:17.76]Come on, I'm so far down here.
[41:19.08]Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.
[41:23.96]Fire in here.
[41:27.69]Damn it.
[41:47.13]Fireplace?
[41:47.99]No, that's not what I'm saying.
[41:49.47]I swear to God, if one of these birds drops a fucking grenade on me, I'm gonna be so mad.
[42:04.67]Where the hell am I?
[42:05.89]Wait, what?
[42:06.64]I went around- I went- Wait, then where am I in a circle?
[42:11.14]Wait.
[42:13.14]Hold on a second.
[42:15.36]I had to have missed one.
[42:20.27]Maybe this one down over here?
[42:21.53]I don't have enough to... I don't have enough to... I'm scared to attack that guy.
[42:27.35]There's a chest over there, too.
[42:30.59]Teleport.
[42:36.57]Yeah, but I swear there's probably... There's probably one right here somewhere.
[42:42.28]Like, right... Okay, look at this.
[42:43.98]Like, where are... This spot.
[42:45.16]This one's probably right here.
[42:50.12]Hit.
[42:57.41]Alright, well, at least I know... It's not safe.
[43:02.19]Okay.
[43:03.19]So, let me... If I go from this spire that's up here, I can just kind of... I'll do skip.
[43:08.78]I'll do castle skip.
[43:10.30]Right?
[43:11.02]Which will put me right here.
[43:11.76]Yeah, and then I can level up once or twice as well.
[43:18.59]Yeah, because Castle Skip puts me right here.
[43:22.28]Wait a minute.
[43:27.10]Where am I?
[43:29.18]Yeah.
[43:33.93]Why do I not heal?
[43:34.67]I don't have any flasks left.
[43:36.35]Okay.
[43:42.06]Okay.
[43:44.71]Let me level up.
[43:46.00]I have a lot of those crunchies.
[43:47.90]I got plenty of crunchies.
[43:49.96]I have a lot of crunchies.
[43:53.60]Wait, that's wrong.
[43:54.98]Here they are.
[43:56.68]Yeah, let's use it.
[43:59.52]I have not been using the crunchies.
[44:05.33]What do I need? 3600.
[44:18.41]I think I have a big one.
[44:19.93]Gain runes.
[44:20.81]Alright, let's take this one.
[44:21.71]Alright, that'll get me to 3900.
[44:26.25]What do I need after that?
[44:37.60]Either intelligence or endurance.
[44:43.81]How are you liking soul caliber?
[44:46.61]It's pretty good.
[44:51.06]What is, in your opinion, the most clusterfuck of a stream you've ever done?
[44:53.76]The family dinner stream.
[44:55.26]Without a doubt.
[44:57.72]Um... Strength.
[45:02.12]I don't really want to do strength until I need it.
[45:04.82]But I probably will soon here, right?
[45:09.07]I imagine that very soon, even a deck scaling weapon, I'm going to have to have at least probably 12 to 15 strength.
[45:19.95]And it's cheap now.
[45:24.32]But... I think I want some more endurance.
[45:32.68]I'll get intelligence to 18.
[45:33.46]And then... Actually, I might be able to do it right now.
[45:42.55]Yeah, I definitely will.
[45:43.55]Yeah, this is gonna get me to at least probably 3,000-4,000.
[45:45.09]Shit.
[45:45.31]Okay.
[45:50.56]It's alright.
[45:52.41]Alright, so now from here, I gotta do... Wait, how much is this one?
[45:55.13]None.
[45:57.99]Alright, so here we are.
[45:58.73]So right there.
[45:59.29]I just do castle skip.
[46:00.79]Right here, and I'm back to where I was.
[46:02.09]Holy shit.
[46:08.10]That was almost a disaster.
[46:09.12]Okay.
[46:09.96]So now we go this way.
[46:16.41]And this is exactly where I just was.
[46:18.62]So now I'm in a better position.
[46:20.74]Let's do some exploration.
[46:22.62]But first, I want to go down here because there's an item down here.
[46:26.70]Where was it?
[46:28.88]Where was it?
[46:29.44]I asked a question.
[46:30.24]You don't even have five seconds to respond.
[46:42.32]Okay, here we go.
[46:43.80]I'm going to go in here and kill this guy.
[46:45.90]Because I have to be a video game player.
[46:49.15]And these guys are hard to play against.
[46:52.07]I need to play.
[46:53.23]There it is.
[46:53.63]Right here.
[46:55.69]I got to kill this guy.
[46:57.37]There's no... We're going to cheese him.
[47:10.02]Okay.
[47:25.35]god I hate these like long-winded swings when somebody swings a weapon at you and normally it's just like here it comes right but when they do these little like crow hop moves where they're like here it comes
[47:54.81]Oh, and by the way, it's gonna be a 360 degree tornado spin, too.
[47:59.51]Don't miss this jump, please!
[48:00.80]Okay.
[48:02.80]That was 3,000 souls I would've lost.
[48:04.92]I'm fine.
[48:05.48]Everybody relax.
[48:10.58]You're calling this guy the fuck out, man.
[48:13.99]He's like a streamer?
[48:17.01]Yeah, I mean, it's like fucking bullshit.
[48:18.89]The guy does these dumb, shitty tactics when he plays PvP, and it's annoying.
[48:22.39]Like, what do you mean, calling him out?
[48:42.37]He definitely saw that.
[48:47.75]I need to get a backstab on him.
[48:50.47]And I should have had it the first time, but I apparently didn't for some reason.
[48:56.83]He turns back around this way.
[48:57.83]Yeah, he walks back this way.
[48:58.93]Okay, here we go.
[48:59.41]I'm going to get the backstab, and I'm going to kick his ass.
[49:17.97]You see how long that move was?
[49:31.32]What the fuck just happened?
[49:32.94]That was crazy.
[49:39.60]Where did my souls go?
[49:40.32]Hey, wait.
[49:45.38]Didn't I have, like, 3,000?
[49:45.92]What happened to them?
[49:53.51]You picked them up.
[49:54.53]Yeah, but I thought I had, like, already had 2,900.
[49:57.43]And you have 3,000.
[49:59.55]Yeah, why are some of them gone?
[50:01.95]It's the cheese tax.
[50:09.95]I think you still lose some when you die, do you?
[50:12.43]That's new.
[50:15.91]Wait, I swear to God, I thought I had like 2,800 or something.
[50:21.83]After killing that guy, I don't know, that's weird.
[50:23.93]Show your map.
[50:31.53]It was the cheese tax.
[50:35.25]Okay, so there's got to be a way to go from here over there.
[50:38.50]Yeah.
[50:42.46]I mean, it's not that way, because that's where the... I don't want to fight this guy.
[50:45.12]I don't care.
[50:48.22]Where was that door?
[50:50.76]Really?
[50:51.02]Jeez, Dad.
[51:01.09]That's actually really funny.
[51:03.98]Alright, this is where I wanted to go.
[51:10.96]Pretty sick.
[51:11.46]Cheese stacks?
[51:13.59]Cheese tacks.
[51:18.45]Okay, gotta be ready for anything.
[51:34.35]Lump of flesh.
[51:37.34]Bristled's Memento.
[51:38.70]It's a key.
[51:40.16]And a golden rune.
[51:41.12]Okay.
[51:42.46]I actually picked up a bunch of items.
[51:43.40]I need to look what they do.
[51:50.77]That's up there.
[51:51.41]This is just the other room.
[51:55.11]Ooh.
[51:57.17]What?
[51:57.45]Really?
[52:01.19]Elevator.
[52:08.99]I'm not going to get away with the cheese for long.
[52:10.85]No, I know.
[52:11.47]I know.
[52:11.67]Alright, so that... This is... It goes up here.
[52:22.91]This... Okay, so now I'm... This is like a weird skip.
[52:26.67]To what, though?
[52:31.83]This is the tower.
[52:32.66]Tower's right here.
[52:36.54]Where is this in regards to where I am right now?
[52:40.24]Oh!
[52:40.42]Nice.
[52:41.64]Still need a little bit more.
[52:48.98]I did get a rune.
[52:49.48]This is a golden rune.
[53:01.15]Still need more.
[53:07.56]Uh, let's just kill this guy and get his, uh... So, I know I keep saying souls, but whatever.
[53:13.16]Alright.
[53:28.90]So, that's actually really helpful.
[53:31.24]I got... Wait, I got a key item.
[53:34.96]When I have a second to pause, I'm going to take a look at it.
[53:40.83]Alright, hold on.
[53:44.53]What is that for?
[53:52.66]Brooch wrapped in red velvet.
[53:55.72]Memento left by the chrysalid sacrifice for grafting.
[53:58.56]A brooch wrapped in red velvet.
[53:59.90]Traces of blood are visible.
[54:01.66]Faintly visible spirits try to convey something, but their voices cannot be heard.
[54:08.21]Key item.
[54:12.27]Small withered bag knitted by hand.
[54:14.23]Oh, okay.
[54:15.91]What does that go?
[54:28.54]Okay.
[54:30.40]Oh, progress I think is out this way, right?
[54:36.51]No.
[54:38.55]Progress is...
[54:41.35]Where is progress?
[54:45.81]It's not over here.
[54:46.81]I'm gonna go back up.
[54:57.43]Yeah, I haven't gone up this way.
[54:58.49]Alright, progress is this way.
[55:10.42]Did I go up this?
[55:11.32]Did I go over here?
[55:11.92]He's senile.
[55:20.51]Yeah, it's this way.
[55:21.03]Okay.
[55:21.19]Alright, there's that scary guy with the axe again.
[55:25.12]I think I just...
[55:37.98]Wait.
[55:38.76]Is this openable with that thing?
[55:41.23]Oh.
[55:41.39]This guy sucks.
[55:52.73]I'm just running.
[55:53.29]Fuck it.
[55:53.55]Actually, I could probably get by him.
[55:57.35]I don't want to fight this guy again.
[55:58.85]He's annoying.
[55:59.25]He BMs.
[56:02.39]He's a BMer.
[56:03.13]I don't like him.
[56:05.72]Alright, then... Oh, I can jump over this.
[56:08.66]Okay.
[56:11.63]You should play Elden Ring.
[56:24.44]You should stop what you're doing.
[56:31.28]Don't blow the horn!
[56:32.30]Okay.
[56:41.04]The sound of progress, my friend.
[56:42.76]Okay.
[56:52.51]Hey, hey, remember me?
[56:56.09]I can hit you through a wall.
[56:58.94]Worse I hope not.
[57:08.18]Oh, what's, but there's something down there.
[57:10.56]There's a lot of stuff down here.
[57:19.53]This is the front door to the castle, but I was never able to get up there.
[57:22.89]Yeah, I see the ladder here, but I mean, look, there's items, there's stuff on the ground.
[57:31.72]One, two.
[57:32.36]Maybe I can go through.
[57:33.86]Let me see.
[57:35.26]Okay, there's a ladder there.
[57:36.94]Ah, it's stuff I missed.
[57:39.02]Ah, fuck it.
[57:39.40]Whatever.
[57:41.70]I see the ladder.
[57:42.26]I see the ladder.
[57:43.16]Don't worry.
[57:45.94]Tree's going to be a boss.
[57:49.78]Just calling it now.
[57:50.34]Okay.
[57:55.78]Okay.
[58:00.81]It's like a weird spot.
[58:01.93]Let me see what's over here.
[58:02.69]A lot of nothing.
[58:15.05]I can go that way.
[58:16.11]Okay.
[58:20.82]Let me drop down there.
[58:23.64]See what the heck's going on over there.
[58:24.72]Yeah, let me see what the heck's going on here.
[58:40.15]Okay, so.
[58:43.11]Ah, this is the door.
[58:44.27]Wait.
[58:59.04]What a terrible guard.
[59:02.20]Why are you looking into the wall?
[59:04.18]Like, if you're aiming this way, what are you doing?
[59:07.41]He was AFK.
[59:12.47]Pickled turtleneck?
[59:16.17]Why do I feel like that's like a TikTok or like an Instagram trend?
[59:19.91]Like pickling your clothing.
[59:23.38]Yeah, we see I pickled it for about six months and it came out and it actually looks a lot better.
[59:27.24]I like the design that came out with it.
[59:28.96]Nice.
[59:43.27]Boomer moment.
[59:44.21]Because I said TikTok.
[59:47.55]I said TikTok.
[59:48.63]I don't like that I said TikTok.
[59:58.20]You should do the orangutan.
[60:03.10]Okay, so that got me the key.
[60:04.90]Which now I just got to run around.
[60:06.66]Which there's the door that led to here.
[60:08.64]That guy was just resting.
[60:11.91]Yep.
[60:13.37]I think I have to go back up, though.
[60:15.53]There's no way to go the other way, unless I can go this way.
[60:19.15]Which, I don't think I can.
[60:23.40]Um... Anything on the chandeliers?
[60:29.58]No.
[60:30.14]No, we just gotta go back.
[60:34.46]Back up, dude.
[60:35.60]Dude, just go full magic build.
[60:38.72]No, I'm not gonna go full magic.
[60:43.94]Okay, well, I just need to go... Where am I going here?
[60:46.04]Over here, right?
[60:48.08]Whatever, I'm just going this way.
[60:51.90]Where's the... Where the hell am I?
[60:55.58]I need to get back up to where I was.
[61:02.84]Wait, what?
[61:06.30]Getting confused.
[61:09.30]I should actually start putting markers...
[61:12.66]down for just kind of traveling around and walking around because you kind of go around in circles sometimes you're just like wait where the fuck am I okay yeah and then over this way yep
[61:39.72]What about your notes?
[61:41.30]Um, I think notes are for, like, important things that I have to remember.
[61:45.44]Not necessarily about direction.
[61:50.36]So this is going up here.
[61:51.36]So now, just climb back up.
[61:56.70]Climb up here.
[61:57.92]I almost have enough to do the... I feel like I'm gonna find another fire, though.
[62:02.46]Like, almost immediately.
[62:04.32]Like, very soon here.
[62:07.15]That's what's getting me down there.
[62:07.97]All right.
[62:09.09]I am convinced that there is going to be a fire here soon.
[62:15.01]So I'm just going to keep going.
[62:18.89]I just... Just jump down here?
[62:25.65]Or just go down here?
[62:26.59]I think I'm just going to go down here.
[62:31.51]Use the key.
[62:32.27]I think I need two.
[62:33.76]I think I'm just going down here.
[62:38.38]Like, whatever, right?
[62:39.14]Like, should I... I can go from here to there?
[62:41.56]No.
[62:41.62]Should I just jump from here to there?
[62:43.62]I feel like I'm gonna die.
[62:54.55]Don't break your hip.
[62:55.35]Don't do it.
[62:55.99]It could be fall damage.
[62:57.21]Use the ladder instead.
[62:58.07]Um... What's over here?
[63:03.05]Can I not go over there?
[63:12.28]It looks like I can jump over there and go that way.
[63:17.46]Use the ladder.
[63:18.78]I'll go back down.
[63:19.36]Maybe that's actually death.
[63:26.16]From here, I'm trying to think of where I can go.
[63:30.26]I could go this way, jump down here, and then go over there.
[63:32.86]Should I do that?
[63:35.86]I'm just going to do it.
[63:36.52]I think.
[63:40.97]I think I'm doing it.
[63:41.79]I'm just going to go that way.
[63:49.89]Okay.
[63:56.48]I'm here.
[63:57.02]I might as well get the items.
[63:59.88]There are a couple.
[64:08.89]Ooh, that's good.
[64:15.62]Alright, I'm gonna go that way and jump over now.
[64:20.16]Did you get the cat item?
[64:21.32]I don't... I don't think so.
[64:33.23]Arrows?
[64:34.08]Alright, this is where it gets weird.
[64:44.27]I think that's the, that's where I gotta go.
[64:47.39]Or down there.
[64:53.17]Please tell me there's a fire here.
[64:54.07]I feel like I've gone a pretty long ways without one.
[64:57.54]Wait.
[65:00.46]Shit, I can go down here.
[65:02.16]I can also... Now, that's just kind of where I was before the main gate, right?
[65:16.49]Uh-oh.
[65:19.46]Festering Bloody Finger.
[65:20.64]Okay, I can't... This is going to be very tricky.
[65:33.21]I have to just be a gamer here.
[65:36.73]If I can just pull one, that would be great.
[65:40.11]Because I don't want to fight them both at the same time.
[65:41.89]And I hope they don't aggro at the same time.
[65:43.62]So we're just going to go for it.
[66:02.64]The slow fucking attacks kill me every time!
[66:05.18]They're so slow!
[66:06.50]I just... They're like full two seconds.
[66:11.77]I just think it's gonna happen way sooner than it does.
[66:18.08]Everybody's so slow in this game.
[66:19.48]Everybody takes forever to swing.
[66:20.84]Fuck.
[66:31.80]At least I have the skill.
[66:38.65]That's copium.
[66:39.97]Yeah, it is copium.
[66:40.99]And I'm gonna suck it and smell it.
[66:43.27]Whatever that... You know what I mean?
[66:54.31]You call me and you, like, you, like, you suck it.
[66:57.13]You, like, and hit, right?
[67:04.17]Again, like I fought that last boss.
[67:06.35]In Elden Ring, wait a full, another full second before you dodge with every single enemy in the entire game.
[67:15.96]Everybody's weapons are apparently so heavy in this game that it gives them five full seconds to fucking swing them.
[67:22.98]Duly noted.
[67:29.34]Okay.
[67:32.63]Back over here.
[67:33.17]Uh, right?
[67:35.65]Yeah.
[67:39.47]You lost a bunch of souls.
[67:41.01]I didn't lose them yet.
[67:43.15]Go get them.
[67:46.89]Still alive.
[67:48.99]Well, just stay down there.
[67:49.75]I don't care.
[68:00.94]Deep slurping copium?
[68:05.53]What does that mean?
[68:12.41]Turn it on high.
[68:15.71]Sir, I don't think you should turn it on high.
[68:17.20]Turn it on as high as it goes.
[68:21.20]I don't know.
[68:21.68]I think that's kind of dangerous.
[68:23.08]I said to do something that means you do it.
[68:25.06]I'm king.
[68:35.47]Too much.
[68:45.72]Raid song?
[68:47.10]Oh, here we go.
[68:47.70]We got a raid.
[68:49.93]Too much copium.
[68:51.73]I feel the need to defend every single Marvel movie and Marvel TV show.
[68:59.49]Ever made.
[69:01.29]Even dating back to the fucking 90s.
[69:05.95]Thanks, RT.
[69:08.55]Appreciate the raid.
[69:11.31]Wait, we're doing Elden Ring?
[69:19.02]Are you playing Elden Ring too?
[69:25.14]Oh man, people just came in and be inhaling Gokil.
[69:31.45]You don't understand.
[69:35.78]I think X-Men Wolverine Origins actually was a pretty good movie.
[69:41.16]It was actually very well made and the cinematography was actually pretty good.
[69:46.16]Uh, King, King German, what the fuck are you talking about?
[69:50.30]Uh, it's like 1400.
[69:52.85]Why are you saying these things?
[69:54.01]2006 was four years ago.
[70:03.24]Well, thanks for the raid, dude.
[70:04.62]Welcome.
[70:05.86]Hope you're doing good.
[70:07.46]I currently just was very upset at this game because I found it to be not cool and not fun and very not fog champ.
[70:16.92]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[70:17.78]I gotta figure out where I'm going.
[70:18.54]Where am I going?
[70:21.06]The idea is... Back to... This is why I need the fucking marker.
[70:29.66]It was down the ladder and then...
[70:34.02]Where?
[70:34.56]It was, like, right here somewhere, right?
[70:35.86]Oh, I dropped down, right.
[70:39.77]I went right here.
[70:42.99]Maybe I can, like, hit something there so I don't get to take damage, but I don't think I can.
[70:46.57]Did that work?
[70:47.37]No.
[70:48.87]Alright, no more copium, no more bullshit.
[70:52.69]Just go get this guy.
[70:55.08]And...
[70:56.99]The slow swings, just get ready.
[71:00.21]I know it's gonna make me very mad and you're all gonna laugh.
[71:03.04]Everyone's gonna laugh at me when I lose again.
[71:05.52]Let's go.
[71:21.85]Oh, that's bad.
[71:26.55]That's fucking bad.
[71:28.55]Wait, it's climbing the ladder!
[71:50.27]Guys, what?
[71:51.69]Come on.
[71:53.57]Get away from me.
[71:54.95]You don't climb ladders.
[72:12.26]Shit.
[72:29.80]I was fully prepared to do that again.
[72:36.11]Where is he?
[72:37.83]Whoa!
[72:38.47]Oh, it's a fucking thing!
[72:40.39]The drape!
[72:41.73]I thought like a tentacle came down and grabbed me!
[72:46.83]What the fuck, dude?
[72:48.31]Why?
[72:48.81]Now I'm just like, I'm all cracked out now!
[72:51.81]Holy shit!
[72:55.06]I am cracked up right now after that.
[72:57.68]Are you kidding me?
[72:58.48]That's so violent.
[73:01.62]That moved around so weirdly and violently.
[73:03.90]I think I can get him before he comes over here.
[73:11.35]Alright, stay here.
[73:24.98]I'm definitely losing souls.
[73:27.30]Because I had like 4,000.
[73:34.04]Copium.
[73:39.33]He's coping in advance.
[73:40.79]Yeah.
[73:41.81]Because if I died, you were about to hear a lot of bullshit.
[73:45.59]Okay?
[73:45.89]I was going to talk a bunch of shit.
[73:49.99]You wouldn't be able to escape it unless you, of course, hit the X and left because you didn't want to listen to it.
[73:58.61]All right, but I'm still not out of this yet.
[74:00.43]I'm kind of fucked right now because... Unless I... Okay, that guy's gonna shoot me.
[74:11.38]Oh, no.
[74:12.00]He's gonna shoot me with that.
[74:12.95]He's gonna hit me.
[74:18.43]No, don't get up.
[74:18.91]Don't get up.
[74:19.23]Don't get up.
[74:31.13]off with this fucking horse shit.
[74:32.87]There's always a guy sitting down somewhere who slowly gets up after you attack the one guy that you see.
[74:42.44]Oh, I'm insane.
[74:43.06]I gotta run by it.
[74:48.04]I'm just running by all these fucking turds.
[74:53.88]Here comes the cheese tax.
[74:55.35]There is no cheese text.
[74:56.57]It's called, I'm running by everybody.
[74:58.59]And hopefully I don't die in the process and lose four thousands.
[75:03.40]Whatever they are.
[75:07.22]If you were in a Souls game, what kind of creature would you be?
[75:10.30]Definitely one of the ones that goes like this.
[75:12.56]You know what I mean?
[75:22.89]I didn't want to do it.
[75:23.69]I really didn't want to do it.
[75:24.75]Because I didn't want to hurt everybody's ears.
[75:31.71]And my moveset would definitely be one of the ones that goes... Like making that sound.
[75:36.29]And then going... And then falling down.
[75:41.94]And then you just kill me in three hits.
[75:54.09]Alright, back up.
[75:56.61]I'm gonna just try to get over there and run, and just pick up my souls at least.
[76:01.63]And this, if I die here... Oh, I'm gonna be upset, but let me just be not stupid about this.
[76:07.00]Selectively kill people that need... Oh, just knock them down?
[76:09.18]Okay, just go.
[76:12.26]Where is he at?
[76:16.00]Pretty bad!
[76:23.18]Okay, we're safe.
[76:29.92]It looks like Burger King's.
[76:33.32]It looks like Burger King.
[76:35.19]From Sneak King?
[76:37.25]I look like the Burger King from Burger King.
[76:39.29]They didn't make him up for Sneak King, although that would be really funny if they did.
[76:55.39]already out of potions.
[76:56.81]Fuck.
[76:57.29]Okay, so I gotta just get over there, ignore everybody, and just get the souls and just run.
[77:05.73]It's okay.
[77:06.15]That's what you can do that in these games.
[77:07.73]It's a decent strategy.
[77:08.77]It really is.
[77:10.69]So, they're around the corner.
[77:12.01]I see them right there. ...
[77:26.18]See ya.
[77:28.94]See ya.
[77:31.14]Where do I go from here?
[77:32.14]There's a ladder.
[77:34.38]Ooh, a ladder.
[77:36.56]Oh, thank God.
[77:37.50]Holy shit.
[77:38.80]He hit me with that.
[77:39.84]The hitbox.
[77:40.78]Somebody fucking 10 miles down the road swung an axe.
[77:43.81]And I got hit by it.
[77:45.35]Oh, yeah.
[77:45.95]They're climbing.
[77:46.73]They're climbing.
[77:47.43]They're climbing.
[77:47.95]They're climbing.
[77:48.43]They're climbing.
[77:48.95]They're climbing up right now.
[77:50.27]They're right behind me.
[77:51.39]They're right behind me.
[77:52.21]They're right behind me, I think.
[77:53.33]They're right behind me.
[77:56.05]I got a cookbook.
[77:56.55]I escaped.
[78:00.78]Where am I?
[78:05.04]Where am I?
[78:09.50]Almost fell down that hole.
[78:10.36]That would have been horrible.
[78:13.75]Do I need to go there?
[78:16.47]Yeah, they're taking souls away.
[78:22.77]That's new.
[78:23.51]That's not in any of the other games.
[78:25.15]They're literally... It's a tax.
[78:26.77]It's a death tax.
[78:40.15]It's like 30%.
[78:40.45]Yeah, that's new.
[78:43.70]Alright.
[78:44.76]Did I miss anything over here?
[78:46.20]I'm afraid to try to make this jump, actually, if I'm honest.
[78:49.46]Otherwise, I'm fucking dead meat.
[78:51.73]So, do I drop down here and just spam at this guy?
[79:01.05]Yeah, right.
[79:01.93]Yeah, right.
[79:04.86]Un-fucking-believable, dude.
[79:06.22]That was almost a disaster.
[79:09.30]You gotta be kidding me.
[79:12.73]It's gonna hit me through the floor.
[79:21.25]Don't.
[79:30.15]Okay.
[79:33.76]Please don't have anybody in this room.
[79:38.54]Wooden great shield.
[79:48.05]I could go that way.
[79:49.95]Oh man, that's a big person.
[79:51.99]I could go that way.
[79:52.74]I could try to go that way.
[79:55.10]Let me see what's over here.
[79:55.84]I need a better weapon.
[79:58.42]I need to upgrade a weapon.
[80:00.62]I actually did pick up a weapon.
[80:01.94]I forget what it was, but hold on.
[80:03.28]Let me see.
[80:03.78]Is there anything here that I need to look at?
[80:06.58]Alright, I'm going over there.
[80:08.78]There's also that wolf with the sword.
[80:12.53]Enemy thing.
[80:15.25]That I could probably go kill.
[80:17.67]Did they get a new axe?
[80:18.47]Yeah.
[80:37.58]I don't know.
[80:37.94]Not sure where to go.
[80:40.10]Need to call the boys?
[80:48.65]That's not a bad idea.
[80:51.97]If I don't need to aggro this... There's a dog right there.
[80:55.95]Oh my god.
[80:57.07]Alright.
[81:04.79]In that door?
[81:06.15]Or up in that door?
[81:07.43]I don't know.
[81:11.17]I think before I do this, I think I have to consult with the boys.
[81:16.33]Alright.
[81:17.41]Here's the plan.
[81:18.69]We have an opportunity to go up or we have to... I hear somebody moving.
[81:23.96]Okay, no I don't.
[81:25.72]We have an opportunity, boys.
[81:26.68]Let's go!
[81:32.98]What's that?
[81:33.32]I don't know.
[81:37.45]Boys, no!
[81:38.47]No!
[81:39.27]Don't attack people!
[81:41.17]Um... Bonfire!
[81:44.85]Bonfire!
[81:46.75]Nice job, boys.
[81:48.69]You did it.
[81:50.15]You attacked like a boss.
[81:52.83]Alright, let's go.
[81:53.63]Hell yeah.
[82:00.89]The boys are the fucking worst.
[82:02.59]They're so awful.
[82:03.79]Okay, so what are we doing here?
[82:11.75]Probably another point into...
[82:19.94]Do I want more endurance?
[82:22.47]I think so.
[82:23.91]Either endurance or intelligence.
[82:24.87]No, get intelligence to 18.
[82:33.10]So.
[82:35.14]Very important.
[82:36.34]Let's go kill this fucking guy.
[82:39.42]Why not?
[82:53.00]I'm trying to go up the goddamn stairs.
[82:58.57]You just hit your own dog.
[83:30.73]I didn't get the backstab, shit!
[84:00.53]Oh, there's an animal up here.
[84:17.82]He tried to kick me down the stairs.
[84:19.26]Oh, there's no juice in this thing.
[84:40.73]What are you wearing on your head?
[84:41.63]Is that a pumpkin?
[84:42.63]Okay, well that guy's gone.
[84:50.72]There's something where he was standing.
[84:51.98]What is this?
[84:55.32]What is that?
[84:56.74]Can I break this or something?
[84:58.91]It's like a weird thing to have here.
[85:00.25]What is this?
[85:12.04]Start using one-liners when you get kills.
[85:13.98]Nope.
[85:14.54]I'm not going to do that because... What is this?
[85:24.89]Prophecy painting.
[85:25.95]A prophecy painting.
[85:43.27]Prophecy painting.
[85:45.72]Reminisce of the painting prophecy.
[85:47.64]Examine it using square.
[85:51.56]I'm afraid to touch this.
[86:00.66]Square, X, whatever.
[86:02.62]I actually don't think I want to do that.
[86:03.96]I'm kind of scared to press that button.
[86:06.62]What if it sucks me into a new world or something?
[86:10.72]Button here.
[86:18.14]watching you in a bar germa do something wacky hey hey this one this one goes out to this one goes out to all y'all in the bar hey three two one let's go um green tea hey what are you drinking hey dude what are you drinking

[86:57.52]What kind of beer?
[86:58.90]Oh.
[87:06.62]What are you drinking?
[87:08.54]Welcome to every conversation you have in a fucking bar.
[87:14.24]Oh, can I try that?
[87:14.92]Yeah, let me try it.
[87:18.12]Oh, that's like spicy.
[87:19.52]What do you got?

[87:21.84]Oh, that's called the Dr. Manhattan?
[87:23.54]Let me try that.
[87:24.54]It's blue and it smells.
[87:25.50]I don't know.
[87:28.48]That's not for me.
[87:28.94]I don't like gin.
[87:29.50]What do you got?
[87:30.16]Let me see.
[87:30.44]I don't like beer, dude.
[87:35.22]I'm not a beer guy.
[87:37.98]You want to try mine?
[87:39.80]It's fucking sludge.
[87:40.78]I got it from the fucking toilet.
[87:42.46]Try it.
[87:59.42]Minus two.
[88:00.00]Play the game.
[88:06.18]They said I was on TV in their bar!
[88:07.86]What, you want me to not, like, say hello?
[88:09.55]There's a door back here.
[88:23.70]This is a shortcut, maybe?
[88:25.76]This looks like it's probably a shortcut.
[88:28.75]To... I don't know.
[88:33.43]Gotta find out.
[88:39.19]How much to have you sing at my wedding?
[88:42.70]Um... Three or four million dollars?
[88:53.88]So... Okay.
[88:55.38]I'm not going down there yet.
[89:01.70]Is this the front door?
[89:03.59]It's not.
[89:08.93]I have not been over here.
[89:10.59]That's not the front gate.
[89:12.09]The front gate's down here.
[89:18.69]So I should probably take a look over here for a minute.
[89:25.54]Did I even rest at that stupid bonfire?
[89:35.20]I'm also going to do some allocation here.
[89:37.10]I want to... I need more health.
[89:40.40]How do I like Breath of the Wild so far?
[89:42.74]I never played Breath of the Wild.
[89:54.72]I haven't played it.
[89:57.45]Sorry.
[89:59.31]The bar is real.
[90:05.06]our video what am I doing up here what am I doing up here they can't even hear me should I try to communicate
[90:33.31]Like, like, like, like, hey, hey, wait, wait, look, look, look over here.
[90:41.58]Hey, everybody, everybody look over here.
[90:46.86]Hey, you, wait, look.
[90:51.27]Hey, everybody, hey.
[90:55.99]One, two, three.
[91:10.85]I'm probably... I probably just look like a fucking psycho.
[91:15.26]Nobody's probably watching this TV.
[91:18.22]Nobody's watching this TV.
[91:19.86]I don't think anyone is.
[91:22.88]It's gonna be so weird looking over there and being like...
[91:27.06]What's going on on the TV over there?
[91:29.17]In a lot of bars, TVs are just on.
[91:31.19]Like, I'll be honest.
[91:33.37]They'll be like a basketball game or like a baseball game or like some talk show.
[91:38.11]Nobody's really paying attention.
[91:41.72]Use the notepad to say hi?
[91:43.04]Okay, that was bad.
[91:59.67]communicate.
[93:09.45]Okay, I'm going to play the game now.
[93:10.81]Somebody was just really mad that I wasn't playing the game.
[93:15.49]The funniest part is that nobody is probably looking.
[93:20.67]I just look like a fucking weirdo.
[93:26.85]Wait, hold on.
[93:28.13]Is there another one?
[93:33.28]Wait, you took another video?
[93:36.54]We have an update.
[93:44.76]Play the fucking game.
[93:46.22]Hold on, I'm communicating.
[93:48.04]I'm gonna be streaming for like 10 hours today, don't worry.
[93:54.44]Go west, hold on.
[93:56.52]Here it is, update.
[94:02.93]People aren't even paying attention.
[94:07.19]I look like such a fucking weirdo.
[94:09.71]Oh my god.
[94:11.34]Okay, hold on a second.
[94:12.42]This looks so stupid.
[94:19.32]Okay.
[94:19.58]Let's watch the... Oh, you gotta... Hold on.
[94:29.07]So stupid.
[94:45.96]Play the game.
[94:46.76]Hold on a second.
[94:56.55]That's so ridiculous.
[95:02.02]Pretend you're stuck in the TV.
[95:15.61]Guys, you're killing me.
[95:18.25]You're killing me.
[95:21.19]I need to be able to see... Where is this?
[95:23.63]Why did this just disappear?
[95:28.87]I'm like... Where is it?
[95:40.68]Where is it?
[95:43.82]It just like broke.
[95:49.91]Why can't I show it?
[95:53.60]What the fuck?
[95:54.22]I'm like... I'm like... I'm like... Why is it upside down?
[96:29.02]Alright, alright, alright.
[96:30.86]I gotta move on.
[96:32.02]I gotta move on.
[96:35.93]I'm moving on.
[96:36.57]That's funny.
[96:37.33]That's cool.
[96:38.41]Hey, that's cool that you got me in your bar.
[96:41.01]That's pretty cool.
[96:43.89]It's a video of the text.
[96:45.61]Alright, that's fucking funny, but I want to play the game.
[96:55.22]You just showed the bar a video.
[97:02.03]Alright, I'm moving on.
[97:03.41]It's funny.
[97:04.11]It's cool.
[97:04.85]It's funny.
[97:05.63]I'm happy that I'm on your TV.
[97:08.69]That's it.
[97:09.25]Let's go.
[97:25.20]It's not just a TV, Jarba.
[97:27.08]It is.
[97:34.18]You've infiltrated their reality.
[97:41.55]Okay.
[97:42.19]Back to the video game.
[97:52.67]You're stuck.
[97:53.89]No, no, no, no.
[97:55.48]It's funny for a minute, but no.
[97:57.02]Let's move on.
[98:05.47]Ooh, we hate the video game.
[98:11.49]What is all over my mouth?
[98:38.66]No!
[98:45.23]You need to put baby sensories on.
[98:47.13]No, no, no.
[98:51.95]They just got me on their TV and it's fun and it's funny.
[98:56.99]I don't want to like fuck with them, right?
[98:59.05]Like that's... I'd rather just like kind of end it there.
[99:06.96]It's cool that I'm on the TV, though.
[99:08.34]It is.
[99:08.72]I find that really, really... That's really sweet.
[99:27.01]Did you ever beat Hollow Knight off stream?
[99:32.38]That's a really interesting question, actually.
[99:42.67]No, I didn't.
[99:44.89]I really wanted to, but I just didn't find the opportunity to.
[99:46.97]Alright, let's go this way.
[99:51.72]No, I did not.
[100:07.59]What the fuck?
[100:10.21]You were a fine warrior.
[100:12.13]Your only mistake was your choice of muster.
[100:14.74]Let the winds lift you... ...to a higher place.
[100:22.46]How is magic?
[100:23.36]Magic is actually really fun.
[100:27.10]I like it a lot.
[100:28.68]I like the combo magic.
[100:31.04]Kind of magic plus.
[100:52.10]oh my god that's not what I wanted to do okay if you intend to challenge godric audrey I ask you call upon me the winds run foul with his deeds I'm certain father would permit me aid the fight
[101:15.83]You want to fight with me.
[101:16.83]This is a summon.
[101:18.65]Okay, so I can summon you for the fight.
[101:19.89]Whatever that fight is.
[101:20.63]That was a burp.
[101:21.21]Okay.
[101:51.03]I'm imagining that's probably happening very, very soon here.
[101:54.41]Very soon.
[101:59.71]Nice.
[102:00.35]Another charge.
[102:03.85]I haven't been able to use my horse in like six hours of gameplay.
[102:07.23]Damn.
[102:11.35]Okay.
[102:14.27]This looks... This is going to be actually pretty bad.
[102:17.87]I think I'm going to go...
[102:26.51]I think I'm gonna upgrade some weapons.
[102:29.71]At least a couple times.
[102:31.59]Or at least... Because I don't... My weapons are all plus one or plus zero.
[102:49.37]I gotta kill the ad.
[103:04.71]Can I backstab?
[103:06.70]I wonder.
[103:09.48]Can I get on his leg or something?
[103:18.62]This is bad.
[103:30.52]He can't, like, break his leg?
[103:39.90]Really?
[103:47.45]What?
[103:59.05]Ooh, there it is.
[104:18.72]Get out of here!
[104:20.34]Pain in the ass.
[104:25.59]Alright.
[104:26.87]Do I have mana?
[104:27.67]No.
[104:29.93]I don't.
[104:32.09]This guy sounds like a Scooby-Doo villain.
[104:40.84]Ooh, I forgot about that.
[104:48.39]The weapon art is actually incredible.
[104:56.75]Uh-oh.
[105:01.45]Okay, well that's the boss right there.
[105:13.36]Item?
[105:13.66]Well, let me level up one more time.
[105:14.96]I have enough souls almost.
[105:17.30]Give me a minute.
[105:18.62]There's a bonfire.
[105:19.38]Wait, there's a bonfire in there?
[105:20.34]Is there really?
[105:35.29]Oh, okay.
[105:49.87]Get over here.
[105:50.31]What are these things?
[105:54.44]Where am I going?
[105:54.96]What am I doing?
[105:55.56]Ooh.
[105:59.60]Okay.
[106:00.38]Nice.
[106:01.26]That thing's gonna get up.
[106:02.10]So I'm just gonna take this one away.
[106:05.68]Where's this bonfire?
[106:13.75]Oh, there it is.
[106:14.07]Okay.
[106:14.17]Sweet.
[106:16.07]Sweet.
[106:29.24]How many hours until you're gonna jump attack?
[106:31.19]I'm saying at least probably two or three.
[106:41.03]Shit, 4200?
[106:41.37]How many, uh, so, how many rune, uh, crunchy things do I have?
[106:47.86]One.
[106:48.00]Alright, let me, uh, let me just get to... I'm gonna kill some of these guys.
[106:58.83]Because I definitely want to get to enough.
[107:02.42]So I don't... I'm going to die probably 500 times in this boss.
[107:09.08]Hey, hey!
[107:17.29]Settle down.
[107:27.21]Wait, he's jumped up?
[107:40.53]You are so slow like everybody else in this fucking whole universe!
[107:48.02]Ooh.
[107:54.18]I'm the developer of this indie game and I just want to let you know that you really should... I... Okay.
[107:59.56]I'll try.
[108:10.60]Sorcery is so good.
[108:13.18]Although, I think actually using like a two-handed weapon would be best.
[108:23.40]You're still alive.
[108:24.02]All right, just let me get a few more souls and we'll be good.
[108:31.17]Two-handed is pretty good.
[108:42.66]Ooh.
[108:45.08]What do we have here?
[108:45.72]And I'm going to put it into stamina or vitality.
[108:52.95]When are you going to let us have a turn?
[109:01.66]Just get it.
[109:06.96]Alright, fine.
[109:07.52]I will PS4 screen share play with you guys.
[109:12.49]But you have to share.
[109:13.29]Where am I going?
[109:22.66]Okay, so this is just right here.
[109:24.40]Although I don't really want to do this right now.
[109:32.90]Just get it, forehead.
[109:33.88]I know.
[109:34.28]It's 60 fucking bucks.
[109:35.26]I know.
[109:35.62]It's not... It's not like $2.
[109:39.78]I feel you.
[109:41.87]Alright, this is another skip.
[109:43.31]Back here.
[109:55.44]So... What's the point of that skip?
[109:57.94]It, like, doesn't really have a...
[110:01.23]And does it really have that much of a purpose?
[110:02.65]Because there's a bonfire literally right there.
[110:04.07]That's kind of a weird place for that.
[110:15.50]Hmm, okay.
[110:18.28]I still need a few more souls.
[110:20.32]Let's fight the boss, the loser.
[110:21.54]I'm gonna die to the boss.
[110:25.82]So I need to get to the souls required to fight this boss and not lose all the stuff that I have.
[110:42.45]I think that's enough.
[110:43.55]What is it?
[110:44.05]4,600?
[110:44.07]4,500?
[110:47.74]And yeah, I have to go upgrade my stuff too.
[110:49.58]Alright, I'm doing Endurance.
[110:51.46]Endurance.
[110:56.67]And we're traveling.
[110:57.73]I'm going out of here.
[111:01.41]I'm going to the blacksmith.
[111:04.35]Which is... Where is the... This place, right?
[111:07.38]Yeah.
[111:07.56]Because I have to upgrade something.
[111:11.20]I can't just... Plus one.
[111:13.14]It's awful.
[111:15.60]It's very bad.
[111:21.80]Where is he?
[111:27.48]I got a few new weapons as well.
[111:29.48]So, I need to examine what I want to do here.
[111:32.04]Because I actually... The claws are pretty good.
[111:36.19]The claws are fast.
[111:37.07]Let's take a look.
[111:43.55]Okay, I have...
[111:57.20]Why not have the repair?
[111:59.82]It's in ruins.
[112:06.22]Shit.
[112:11.29]Well, back to what we were doing.
[112:13.05]I'm going to just go farm for like five seconds.
[112:16.59]Just get wherever.
[112:18.43]It doesn't matter.
[112:18.91]I could sell something, but I don't want to.
[112:29.51]I really only need, like, 200.
[112:31.15]How much do these guys give?
[112:34.75]Alright, yeah, I'm just gonna kill, like, a few people.
[112:56.57]Oh my god, this guy has to farm.
[112:57.97]He's so bad.
[112:59.09]He can't just play the game as it shows up and progress as it happens.
[113:11.52]Get away from me.
[113:27.32]Okay, that should be enough to upgrade a couple things.
[113:29.95]If I need to sell something, I will.
[113:32.99]Well, thank you for those good meter day subs, Artemis.
[113:37.49]Of the blue.
[113:44.75]I haven't, like, shouted any subs out in, like, two weeks.
[113:50.43]I'm very focused on Elden Ring.
[113:57.25]Okay.
[113:57.87]Uh, back to here.
[113:58.57]Uh, yeah.
[114:01.97]It's because he hates us.
[114:06.78]No, I don't.
[114:16.05]Wrong way.
[114:33.38]Roderick is cool as fuck.
[114:34.42]I'm hyped for you to see him.
[114:35.40]I'm looking forward to it.
[114:39.26]I'm very much looking forward to it.
[114:41.98]Okay.
[114:44.49]So, I've got... This dagger.
[114:49.21]Which I don't want to play with daggers.
[114:50.31]It's too hard.
[114:50.79]It literally takes forever to kill anything.
[114:52.99]Unless you stab things in the back.
[114:54.42]The S-Dock.
[114:57.50]Which is another one of those... I don't want to do it.
[115:02.54]Island Axe.
[115:04.30]This is D in both and requires 12 strength.
[115:12.47]It's probably the claws.
[115:16.58]I have to pick something and I think it's gonna be claws.
[115:20.88]They're fast.
[115:23.24]Blood loss is pretty good.
[115:29.44]Either that, or I need to... I mean, what does this look like?
[115:35.30]With 12 strength... I don't know.
[115:38.22]Does this... Okay.
[115:39.36]Once I upgrade this, does this scale with strength?
[115:42.49]Probably.
[115:49.49]Well, as it stands right now, I have to pick something, and I'm gonna pick the claws.
[115:57.39]Okay.
[115:58.61]I'm going for it.
[116:04.79]Okay.
[116:06.69]Claws have been upgraded.
[116:09.63]And I'm gonna just put one into this, I think.
[116:15.63]Because I haven't found another staff yet, and, like, what... The sorcery scaling, like, needs to be better, right?
[116:21.13]Like, it just does.
[116:21.61]So it's gonna be doing a little bit more damage.
[116:29.94]Okay.
[116:30.94]I actually have, like, a plus two weapon now.
[116:32.86]I'm not walking around like a dickhead.
[116:38.62]And then we need to go back here, and I am ready to attempt whatever this is.
[116:44.52]Which was, uh, here, right?
[116:50.33]Happy birthday to the guy in chat.
[116:53.77]Happy birthday.
[116:54.11]Happy birthday.
[117:01.24]Okay, Laff, get the counter ready.
[117:05.05]I'm gonna stick with 3 and 2.
[117:07.67]I got the boys on standby if I need them.
[117:12.04]It's time to just... Let's... Alright, let's open the door.
[117:17.96]Let's see it.
[117:28.31]I've got a big fuckin' axe.
[117:31.67]It's gonna be slow as shit.
[118:01.12]Okay, I thought this was four people riding a horse.
[118:17.93]Oh man, he's got- he's got- he's gonna be swinging with like eight different arms.
[118:24.65]Bodrick the Grafted.
[118:39.30]Alright, what do you got?
[118:43.60]Show me your moves.
[118:44.26]Okay, it's a lot of AoE.
[118:57.11]Big AoE, big AoE, and he goes for the ball.
[119:09.00]That's a lot of health.
[119:31.13]Whoa, the AoE, right?
[119:32.17]Gotta be careful of the AoE.
[119:33.29]That was a double AoE.
[119:40.36]Holy shit.
[119:43.99]All right, dude.
[119:44.59]Come on.
[119:56.51]One and then it's a two.
[119:57.95]Okay, so you gotta get the fuck away from that.
[119:59.63]Okay, after he does that roll, you gotta get the fuck out of here.
[120:10.78]What's he doing?
[120:11.90]What is he doing?
[120:16.02]Did he miss and hit himself?
[120:17.66]Phase 2.
[120:26.67]Yep, of course.
[120:35.32]True.
[120:53.32]No, it's got his head?
[121:06.92]He has a flamethrower now.
[121:13.46]I think it's time to... Can I jump over it?
[121:15.94]Nope.
[121:19.02]That's insane.
[121:32.77]He looks like a Resident Evil villain.
[121:35.47]Yeah, he does.
[121:36.81]Alright, so it's very clear here.
[121:40.20]So phase one is a lot of just... I don't want to... Here's what I have to do.
[121:46.11]I have to get good.
[121:48.17]And I have to get him all the way to phase two without casting a spell.
[121:54.03]Because that's where it's going to be really important.
[121:55.77]Let's see what I can do.
[122:09.53]One.
[122:10.61]Comes two.
[122:23.09]Yep.
[122:24.18]Oh, fuck, that's bad.
[122:36.30]Oh no, the tornado!
[122:41.33]What the fuck am I?
[122:46.21]I'm in trouble here.
[123:13.73]Gotta get that fucking bleed!
[123:21.40]Yeah, that's faster than the other moves.
[123:27.86]Okay.
[123:42.52]Oh, that's right.
[123:42.94]I did get another seed.
[123:43.66]Yep.
[123:44.02]Thanks for reminding me.
[123:45.56]Seriously.
[123:46.42]I would have absolutely forgot.
[123:49.52]Flasks.
[123:50.24]There we go.
[123:50.98]Okay, that's a big deal.
[123:52.32]That's a huge deal.
[123:56.45]I'm thinking four and two is fine.
[123:58.37]For now.
[124:00.11]We'll see.
[124:00.97]We'll see.
[124:06.21]I gotta get him to phase two without calling on the boys.
[124:10.33]And without casting a spell at him.
[124:13.33]That's definitely doable.
[124:14.67]And then I can hang back, the boys can do what they need to do, and I'll kill them.
[124:22.19]What the fuck just happened?
[124:32.54]That was a weird move.
[124:39.86]That fucking Crowhawk, man.
[124:41.72]Why does everybody have to do that?
[124:43.28]I feel like I'm fighting the little brother of the guy that I fought fucking four hours ago.
[124:57.65]This is a wash.
[124:58.21]Hold over.
[124:58.49]Hold over.
[125:11.41]What about that lady?
[125:19.33]I think I can get it.
[125:20.51]I gotta get back.
[125:21.03]I gotta get to phase two again.
[125:22.01]If I can get to phase two... Then... I bring out the boys.
[125:29.48]And then I just... And then I coward him.
[125:39.34]I'm not doing a lot of damage to him, though.
[125:41.28]I'm only doing, what, like 60 or 70?
[125:43.34]Should we take a little longer?
[125:44.54]Alright.
[126:01.57]Come on, dude.
[126:02.37]Really?
[126:19.72]You can have your little tantrum next time.
[126:28.58]He's just like this amorphous blob.
[126:30.34]I don't even know what he's attacking.
[126:33.13]He's just like moving his body around.
[127:06.44]Parry?
[127:07.20]Can you parry bosses in this game?
[127:08.90]I feel like I tried.
[127:13.69]Should I try parrying?
[127:16.87]I think parrying has the same problem, though.
[127:22.85]That was perfect.
[127:25.73]Like, that was actually a perfect parry.
[127:27.19]I didn't do anything.
[127:27.81]I can't parry.
[127:36.72]I don't think so.
[127:47.43]Yeah, you can't.
[127:53.15]Guard counter works?
[127:54.11]Should I put it on?
[128:03.41]Does thou even lift lowly, tarnished?
[128:09.71]No, I got the right idea.
[128:11.93]I got the right idea.
[128:18.16]I just gotta be patient, be good.
[128:21.72]Go get it!
[128:22.38]That is so slow!
[128:33.43]Everybody's in slow motion.
[128:43.88]All right.
[128:44.26]Okay, so he goes huge, slow swing.
[128:47.70]Dodge attack again.
[128:49.16]You get hit by it again?
[128:55.20]If I dodge that one, he swings immediately after you land with the iframe.
[129:01.13]Fuck this guy.
[129:11.16]He attacks three times in one session.
[129:12.76]Don't stop rolling.
[129:14.32]But how do you... What am I supposed to do?
[129:16.10]Just run away?
[129:16.76]One, two.
[129:29.63]That was a one, two.
[129:32.41]That was three.
[129:37.66]Okay.
[129:44.86]I have a better idea.
[129:46.38]I got a better idea.
[129:47.02]I'm going to use the weapon archer.
[129:48.98]I got it.
[129:49.66]Check this out.
[129:50.96]Let's try this strat.
[129:51.82]Boom, boom.
[130:00.95]It only does two swings.
[130:01.87]Okay.
[130:03.37]So he goes boom, boom.
[130:04.35]I think I can get behind him.
[130:22.74]All right, build up the stamina for a second here.
[130:41.47]No!
[130:51.20]It's so hard to tell if he's going to actually swing or if he's going to do the fucking tornado.
[130:54.01]It's the same animation.
[131:03.48]Wait, does the dodge not have iframes?
[131:05.38]Does the weapon art dodge have iframes?
[131:06.78]It doesn't.
[131:07.34]No, it doesn't.
[131:08.12]Fuck.
[131:08.67]I thought it did.
[131:19.74]Goddamn slow ass goddamn boss fuckers You have range?
[131:32.40]I know I'm trying to get him to phase two without using it because I'll burn through it all and then he's gonna do the flame thrower and he's gonna kill me!
[131:47.39]Should you jump R2?
[131:48.17]Quick jump.
[131:53.31]Quick step and quick jump have iframes?
[131:56.12]What the hell are you guys doing?
[131:59.40]Summon the boys?
[132:00.04]Alright, I'm gonna... Let me try this one or two more times.
[132:06.46]This is a good strategy as long as I can actually do it.
[132:25.23]Every second that he sits there, you think he's gonna swing and he just fucking doesn't.
[132:29.02]Oh, I hate it.
[132:32.64]I hate it.
[133:05.04]Just kill me already.
[133:06.48]I'm going to try a new strategy.
[133:21.78]No, it's... Okay.
[133:23.88]Alright.
[133:24.62]He holds it in the air, and just like his dickhead brother, he goes like this.
[133:33.53]So it's on the... You wait for the two pumps, and then he'll do it.
[133:45.36]So he puts his arm up.
[133:49.84]Okay, there he does it.
[133:50.88]Alright.
[133:51.08]Alright.
[133:55.06]Yeah, he's a two-pump.
[133:55.72]I don't know.
[133:56.10]What does that mean?
[133:56.54]I don't think I want to say that out loud.
[133:57.42]I want to say what you guess.
[133:58.10]I'm not saying that out loud.
[135:10.68]Yeah, yeah.
[135:11.00]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, woah, woah, woah.
[135:15.00]What the fuck?
[134:33.00]These things are- they'll- they're all slow.
[134:40.00]So fucking slow. It's so fucking slow. They're so fucking slow.
[134:51.00]Oh, you're scaring people.
[135:06.60]Alright, let's go.
[135:08.61]I gotta at least get him back down to 50%.
[135:09.63]Like, I...
[135:33.78]Dude, what the fuck, man?
[135:36.28]What the fuck?
[135:38.24]What the fuck?
[135:40.27]What?
[135:43.07]Why in the Elden Ring do they want you just to turn and just run the other direction to the other side of the map?
[135:50.74]Like, oh, he's doing that move, just run all the way to the back.
[135:54.12]And like, we're playing, it's like fucking recess.
[136:03.20]I'm playing like fucking TAG!
[136:11.95]The boys suck!
[136:14.73]They're actually doing pretty good.
[136:32.14]This guy lucky there So
[137:09.42]Oh my god, it was like homing missile!
[137:26.86]Get us the shit out of there.
[137:31.82]Ha ha!
[138:15.69]Run run run run run run run!
[138:36.97]Thank you.
[138:59.46]What is he doing?
[138:59.96]What is he doing?
[139:00.46]What is he doing?
[139:00.96]What is he doing?
[139:01.46]What is he doing?
[139:02.02]Oh, wait.
[139:02.86]I can just smash on him there.
[139:04.18]Okay.
[139:04.98]I can just smash on him.
[139:09.07]I don't know why I thought he was going to explode.
[139:10.69]I can get in there and just, like, wail on him.
[139:13.05]All right.
[139:13.35]All right.
[139:15.07]Okay.
[139:15.29]So when he does that, just absolutely beat the ever-living shit out of him.
[139:19.93]All right.
[139:20.17]Let's go.
[139:22.39]At least I get to see it again.
[139:32.62]Here's another attack with the arm.
[139:47.29]Ground.
[139:48.07]Up in the air.
[139:48.75]Okay.
[139:51.63]Fire.
[139:52.47]Breathing just goes... Oh, fuck.
[139:53.97]Bad.
[139:56.44]How do I get away from him?
[139:57.40]I just can't get away from him.
[140:01.46]Why is it taking me so long to do that?
[140:06.92]Dude.
[140:11.11]I'm going to unbind the left stick, by the way.
[140:13.01]It's just such a hindrance.
[140:14.99]It just fucks with you every single time.
[140:31.80]Get me out!
[141:07.20]Ah!
[141:07.86]Ah!
[141:08.44]What?
[141:08.80]Ah!
[141:20.07]Fire hot.
[141:20.83]Fire.
[141:21.19]Alright.
[141:21.51]I got the strategy here.
[141:22.37]Here's the strategy.
[141:24.29]The strategy is when he... Alright.
[141:25.69]When he goes down... Wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham.
[141:29.50]When he's breathing the fire, you can usually get a few good hits in.
[141:37.89]Alright.
[141:38.13]Let's get this going here.
[141:41.17]Honestly, you know what?
[141:42.17]Phase 1, I think, is... is magical.
[141:48.17]Because I can get them down reliably, hopefully.
[141:49.69]Let's see what I can do here.
[141:51.59]Should I maybe just walk the magic and just get in there and beat the shit out of them?
[141:55.27]Let's see.
[141:56.96]I got it.
[141:58.96]Of course, I had to walk right into that.
[142:00.72]Because who the fuck even tells an idiot to do a single fucking move?
[142:21.56]Unbind it.
[142:22.14]I have to unbind it.
[142:22.96]It's such a bad place to put that.
[142:28.90]I would rather have no ability to crouch than have to crouch in the middle of fucking boss fight.
[143:08.13]Let's go!
[143:08.63]Get in there!
[143:15.35]Oh, is it close enough?
[143:38.98]What?
[143:49.96]What's happening?
[143:51.84]It's a new move.
[143:52.32]I haven't seen that.
[143:52.86]Shit.
[144:01.52]Too greedy.
[144:15.20]Ugh.
[144:39.71]Is it actually a homing missile?
[144:40.99]That's stupid.
[144:41.57]It is.
[144:41.85]It actually is.
[144:44.11]It's a fucking homing missile.
[144:56.30]Here it comes.
[145:17.07]Shit homing missile attacks you and it goes 100 miles per hour.
[145:27.91]I'm burning through potions.
[145:28.71]Alright, I gotta like... I feel like I'm not doing enough damage.
[145:40.30]Like even when I hit him, it just feels like I'm doing like nothing.
[145:43.30]Let me see if I can actually handle this.
[145:46.00]Forget about the boys for now.
[145:48.08]Let me practice for a minute.
[145:49.02]Because, like, seriously, if it's just about... Magic actually is probably going to be a bad idea in the second phase because of how... I don't want to stand still.
[146:15.99]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[146:48.33]What the fuck dude?
[146:57.93]You reach across the whole game!
[147:02.09]My fucking god it's over.
[147:08.25]Let's put gravestones fucking scattered around the whole area and they'll run into them!
[147:16.91]He's in the air and he just goes like,
[147:19.32]I would rather just be like final destination.
[147:31.27]Like there's nothing here.
[147:32.07]It's just me and you and like a black screen behind us.
[147:35.77]I don't want to run into this shit.
[147:37.49]Let's go.
[147:57.65]I keep thinking he's gonna jump in the air and do the big two-handed swing, but he doesn't.
[148:01.27]It's just so hard to tell sometimes what he's actually gonna do.
[148:06.81]He has the same telegraph with like two or three different moves.
[148:18.14]Or he does that shit, and like, what are you gonna do?
[148:19.82]Just get stuck in it.
[148:20.50]And that shit is like driving in a blizzard.
[148:24.90]It takes up the whole fucking screen.
[148:26.01]You can't even see where you're going.
[148:27.15]I'm angry!
[148:38.20]I keep being like a tenth of a second late on that.
[148:46.22]Alright, we're going... We're going to go combo Andy here, okay?
[148:54.50]We're going combo Andy.
[149:08.02]Let's see what I mean in a minute.
[149:14.26]Stop doing fucking moves!
[149:17.56]Like, do you have a fucking stamina bar?
[149:39.43]Try to avoid the fucking huge tombstones!
[149:43.64]You've got these, like, giant, like, ten commandment slabs that are scattered around the whole fucking area.
[149:52.83]Alright, we're going combo.
[150:00.26]Combo.
[150:00.48]Combo.
[150:17.12]um this video game seriously like
[150:45.55]Come on.
[151:33.28]IT WAS UNDER THE GROUND!
[151:35.35]IT WAS UNDER THE GODDAMN GROUND!
[151:36.79]IT WAS LIKE A FUCKING TORNADO UNDER THE- Relax.
[151:44.19]Goal!
[152:22.65]Dude, I can't fucking see through these stupid gravestones, man!
[152:26.33]Come on!
[152:41.06]I'm so fucking dead.
[152:43.24]Let's just come on.
[152:50.10]He just has so many different moves and he has 500 fucking million health.
[152:58.89]Even when I get him down, I only have...
[153:06.84]Joe Biden wouldn't die to this boss.
[153:10.54]I'm not sure Joe Biden would know where X was on the Xbox controller.
[153:17.08]I don't think most people over the age of 60 would know where the X on the Xbox controller is.
[153:23.03]So, I don't think so.
[153:25.13]I think I got an advantage.
[153:26.21]Time to angry fight.
[153:30.59]I'll show you what I mean by that shit.
[153:55.06]You have to seriously go across the whole fucking game.
[154:20.83]Dude, left stick being crouched.
[154:24.04]What were they thinking?
[154:25.58]What were they thinking?
[154:29.10]What were they THINKING?
[154:40.71]I have to unbind it.
[154:41.89]It's like fucking awful.
[154:48.58]What can I change it to?
[154:49.60]There's nothing?
[154:56.64]Dude, the amount of times that like I'm moving around and the left stick just actually clicks in and he crouches.
[155:03.52]It's just like, what the fuck, dude?
[155:06.80]You're down on the D-pad.
[155:07.87]That's actually not a bad idea.
[155:11.84]No, but that... Potions, though.
[155:18.75]Find it to the Xbox button.
[155:27.57]What can I make it?
[155:29.55]What is up on the D-pad?
[155:36.29]Switch sorcery.
[155:40.66]What is... No.
[155:41.70]I don't know what I can even make it.
[155:43.40]I'm just going to leave it without any... Okay.
[155:49.51]Yeah, it's not happening now.
[155:50.71]I'm just going to unbind it.
[155:52.91]Put it on right stick?
[155:56.23]That's actually not a bad idea.
[155:57.19]No, but right stick is lock on.
[156:00.14]That's a huge deal.
[156:04.42]I'm just going to unbind it.
[156:23.00]Dude, that's so irritating.
[156:24.54]You really have to put it in the ground.
[156:27.31]The second one sometimes goes underground.
[156:55.48]I'm in trouble.
[156:55.86]Actually, you know what I need?
[156:57.18]I need more flasks.
[156:58.24]I think I have to go Adventure before I continue to do this.
[157:03.06]Because as a caster...
[157:11.81]Losing a few flasks is like horrible, horrible, horrible.
[157:16.83]I'm at like a disadvantage every fight because I just have like three heal.
[157:23.07]Yeah, I mean, I'm doing like 25% of his bar.
[157:25.76]That's awesome.
[157:26.68]But man, a little bit longer is actually a little better, I think.
[157:36.29]I could probably try just not using magic at all, and just having 5, uh, those blasts.
[157:44.18]Might actually be better.
[158:20.13]The bleed stacks I think are way better than the casting I think.
[158:35.25]I just have to actually hit him.
[158:40.65]Run!
[158:52.39]Not again!
[158:53.01]Right after it?
[158:53.75]Come on!
[159:12.70]No!
[159:13.06]I thought I got under it!
[159:13.87]I didn't get under it.
[159:28.42]No man, you just get so caught!
[160:03.08]Holy shit, I didn't think it was gonna go that far!
[160:12.34]How long does he do it for?
[160:14.32]How fucking long do you do it for?
[160:16.18]I should have gone forward, but I just like he was just at an angle on me.
[160:24.45]Oh my god.
[160:25.41]All right, I've made a decision.
[160:35.11]There's the decision.
[160:38.71]I'm not doing magic.
[160:40.11]Magic, I think, just takes up too much.
[160:43.87]I'd rather have, like, six heals, get up there, actually hit this motherfucker, bleed him, and I think that's gonna be better.
[160:56.96]Let's go.
[161:11.43]Ha ha ha!
[161:38.66]Dude, he didn't do the jump.
[161:40.42]How did he not do the jump?
[161:44.16]Goddamn rock next to me.
[161:45.62]This little fucking ledge had to... The stupid fucking ledge.
[161:49.96]I'm like bumping into the ledge.
[161:51.66]It's like somebody came in and played like fucking Rollercoaster Tycoon and just didn't understand the terrain tool and just fucking moved it all over the place.
[162:21.81]Just die.
[162:22.21]Just die.
[162:22.45]That move is like a full three seconds.
[162:24.45]Just kill him.
[162:29.13]Like, one, two, three.
[162:37.38]Calm down, honey.
[162:38.16]Let's get you some tea.
[162:45.67]I just I want to take that tool in rollercoaster tycoon that like You just drag it over and like smooth so he's fucking bumps.
[162:54.61]All right settle down Oh
[163:29.21]Looking for an opening.
[163:58.62]No you don't!
[164:29.82]Oh my god!
[164:31.10]I'm not doing enough damage.
[164:36.68]How many times did I hit him?
[164:37.78]I did like 10% of his bar?
[164:42.28]Why do I dodge to the left?
[164:43.20]Because it's burned into my brain.
[164:44.70]Dodging right, like, it's hard to do for me.
[164:48.35]Get in there Bloodborne style.
[164:50.35]My problem with getting in there Bloodborne style is the guy is so fucking slow that, like, it's not like a, dodge!
[164:56.83]Here we go!
[164:57.31]Fight!
[164:57.69]Fight!
[164:58.01]Dodge!
[164:58.39]It's just, it's this slow-ass encounter and I just get myself killed.
[165:07.28]That's another reason why I can't do that.
[165:08.88]The guy has, like, a fight me counter.
[165:11.85]This boss has a fight me counter, where you're not supposed to fight him.
[165:14.98]I'm gonna go like this to his head!
[165:30.64]Do you use the quick step?
[165:32.78]Yeah, but the quick step... I don't know.
[165:35.26]It's hard to gauge sometimes.
[165:37.45]Like when you can and can't do it.
[165:38.61]Because if you use quick step when you're locked on, sometimes you'll just spin around and it can be kind of jarring.
[165:45.99]I don't even know what direction I was trying to go there.
[165:50.10]Like I said, your build is awful.
[165:55.05]I mean, it's great for fighting, like, regular enemies.
[165:58.99]But it's sorcery, man.
[166:00.15]Like, if you don't go full sorcery, you're in for some shit.
[166:10.82]Why would a dog... Alright, hold on.
[166:11.98]Let me get this right.
[166:16.14]Alright, I'm going to give him, like, one or two more attempts, and then I'm going to go to something else.
[166:27.77]Is this why all the battle mages died out?
[166:35.38]Just do six magic flasks and fucking run away.
[166:39.88]But I will run out.
[166:41.38]I will run out of flasks.
[166:44.40]I can definitely do it.
[166:45.94]It's just... Here's the problem.
[166:49.38]Splitting between intelligence and dexterity is making both my magic and my actual swings not as good as they could be, right?
[166:58.88]eventually it'll even out eventually it should be fine but for now now I have to rely on both I could do it all right no more no more excuses I'm doing both headphones don't nobody talk to me
[167:36.07]I fucking hate that move.
[167:37.25]It's so dumb.
[167:37.97]It doesn't even give you a chance to fucking attack him.
[167:41.52]He just hits you.
[167:56.91]Thank you.
[168:26.56]You have another move with that fucking combo?
[168:29.33]Oh fuck off.
[169:18.85]Swing it, dude!
[169:20.34]Come on!
[169:22.48]It's so stupid!
[169:23.60]It's like his game is lagging and he's not falling down!
[169:54.38]I'm so dead.
[170:01.19]Oh my god, how are you supposed to close the gap with this fucking guy?
[170:21.92]Hitting the second phase consistently with magic.
[170:23.68]At least it's not the tree.
[170:27.39]The tree sentinel had, like, a tactic.
[170:29.77]You use the horse.
[170:31.07]Which, by the way... Where's the fucking horse?
[170:35.61]Why can't I play with the... Where's the horse?
[170:37.83]Where the fuck is the horse?
[170:40.11]Where's the horse?
[170:48.67]Try this.
[171:09.00]What the fuck happened?
[171:23.28]Boys don't help here.
[171:24.22]They die in one AOE.
[171:43.56]Come on!
[172:11.58]Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
[172:13.56]I'm a little baby and I don't like hard games.
[172:28.23]Dude, I can't even fucking see what he's doing.
[172:32.95]Oh my god, dude.
[172:53.09]Oh my god, I tried to wait too!
[173:25.42]What the fuck?
[173:39.88]He does that stupid shit, man.
[173:42.16]It's so hard to... It's so hard to not get juked when he has 50 other moves he does.
[174:22.83]Oh
[174:51.55]Ah!
[174:54.85]Ah!
[175:25.21]Come on!
[175:57.43]No!
[175:57.59]Stop doing this move!
[176:19.97]What the fuck, man?
[176:21.95]Dude, he's done this like so many times in a row!
[176:27.34]I can't get a position on him.
[176:31.50]He's talking strategy, by the way.
[176:39.15]Oh.
[176:39.61]My.
[176:40.27]God.
[177:00.69]I... No!
[177:02.79]I was doing so good.
[177:05.07]Oh, my fucking god.
[177:08.09]Last one.
[177:08.49]Get in there.
[177:09.53]Boom.
[177:10.78]Boom.
[177:11.10]Get in.
[177:16.06]Oh, my god.
[177:16.70]Can you... Seriously.
[177:18.54]The fucking AoE moves.
[177:20.92]How many are you going to do in a row?
[177:27.90]What the fuck?
[177:31.84]so so
[178:13.20]Oh my god!
[178:42.24]What?
[179:12.23]He got agreed for the bleed, I know.
[179:14.15]It's just, he has so many different kinds- Okay, here's the thing about Elden Ring, listen to me.
[179:22.58]They all have so many different kinds of moves.
[179:26.80]So, like, on a scale of 1 to 10, like, area attacks, like, short attacks, quick attacks, long attacks, on a scale of 1 to 10, they got them all.
[179:38.31]They have from 1 to 10.
[179:41.83]It's so difficult to, like, predict what they're going to do because they have so many different kinds of moves.
[179:48.37]This is not like the dancer that just, like, spins in a circle five times.
[179:54.05]All right, well, I wasn't ready for that one.
[180:06.28]Can I... Can I jump over that?
[180:08.10]No, don't fit even to craft.
[180:18.21]Just jump, but jump where?
[180:21.33]Jump over a lot of things?
[180:24.93]I feel like I've tried to jump over AoE moves and I just get killed.
[180:31.67]The ground pound can be jumped over.
[180:33.41]Can it?
[180:33.75]I feel like I've tried that a few times.
[180:37.19]I'll try it.
[180:37.53]Let's see what happens.
[180:47.10]Okay, not that one.
[180:48.08]That's not a ground time.
[180:52.61]Yeah, that one.
[180:53.17]When he goes... Hold on.
[180:57.85]That would actually save a lot of time, if it actually works.
[181:00.39]I have to go around his right side.
[181:05.52]Slowly tarnished, though it unfit even to grasp.
[181:15.87]have to dodge roll the second one so you have to go like bang bang I feel like he swings too fast to dodge the second one after you get the iframe you're doing good at the beginning I actually that last one was not bad
[181:52.29]Just trying to like... Should I do right trigger?
[181:58.08]Should I do a heavy attack?
[182:00.36]Maybe a heavy attack is better than just one or two.
[182:02.26]I wonder how much bleed.
[182:03.88]Is there a bleed counter that I can see?
[182:22.96]I think that's better.
[182:35.57]Can't get away from that one.
[182:52.76]It also doesn't help that his body goes off the screen too.
[183:06.37]What the fuck?
[183:22.77]so so so
[183:55.90]I have no stamina!
[184:34.40]Fucking can't see when he goes behind a fucking tree dude, come on Oh
[184:46.54]I can't see what he's doing!
[184:48.90]I can't fucking see him!
[184:51.94]He does the roll and gets stuck somewhere and then it's like, alright, what the fuck are you gonna do next?
[185:01.49]Fuck you!
[185:02.65]Fuck you!
[185:03.35]Oh, be careful!
[185:07.91]He might get stuck behind the fucking giant blockade dragon and then good luck finding- He shot a projectile at you behind there, by the way.
[185:15.07]Good luck!
[185:27.93]Proudly born!
[185:56.65]so
[186:22.31]Oh, dude, really?
[186:23.51]Again with this fucking bullshit?
[186:27.79]Like, I... If you're not at, like, the exact precise place you need to be when he just randomly will do that... That was such a good start, too.
[186:37.11]It's just, like, the dude... Can you look at my Bumble profile?
[186:46.03]I can't get any matches.
[186:47.17]Um...
[186:49.75]I don't know.
[186:51.69]He's incredibly mad.
[186:54.10]This... This guy's fucking hard.
[187:06.09]I... reaching fucking fingers!
[187:09.43]You're not as mad as last night?
[187:19.33]I feel like I'm playing the same boss as last night.
[187:21.34]I feel like these are the same people.
[187:41.58]Let's go.
[188:10.13]Thank you.
[188:27.39]I can't, I can't be getting a fourth attack there.
[188:29.63]It takes a fucking so long to do it.
[188:31.13]I don't even remember.
[188:50.11]I keep... I'm just so... I can't get the slow attacks.
[188:54.04]It's always been a problem in every FromSoftware game I've ever played.
[188:58.74]And this game is full of them.
[189:02.09]I gotta die.
[189:20.48]Summon the lady?
[189:21.74]I don't want to summon.
[189:22.74]I want to beat it on my own.
[189:23.78]I don't want to summon.
[189:26.68]I want to beat it on my own.
[189:28.40]Without any help.
[189:31.10]Outside sources.
[189:34.47]I got him down to like 10%, like three or four times now.
[189:36.85]I can do it.
[189:53.37]They got stuck in the fucking gravestones.
[189:55.79]They don't even need to fucking be here.
[189:57.45]Why are they even in here?
[189:59.37]What?
[189:59.55]Like, if the enemies can get stuck on that stuff.
[190:03.07]Delete it!
[190:04.45]Why is it there?
[190:05.15]Delete it!
[190:20.16]Okay.
[190:22.23]So, here's the problem.
[190:24.67]Building bleed stacks on this guy is hard.
[190:26.63]Because by the time you almost have enough, he might just do the whirlwind move and then you just get fucking hit by it.
[190:38.26]Alright, this is the last one before I go do something else.
[190:40.06]Because obviously I need, like, another point in this weapon.
[190:45.19]Or I need another point in sorcery or something.
[191:01.22]What?
[191:03.56]He's in the air.
[191:11.60]I don't... Am I... I can't dodge that second attack.
[191:22.06]Yeah, you can't dodge the second attack.
[191:23.80]There's not enough time.
[191:27.60]By the time you land, he's already swinging his right hand.
[191:29.78]Or his left hand.
[191:38.47]Your armor's at 0% durability.
[191:42.88]Alright, last one for real.
[191:44.66]Actually, last one.
[191:45.64]Last one for real.
[191:58.25]See what I mean?
[192:02.53]Like, you just can't.
[192:03.81]You can't stay near him.
[192:07.89]Fucking gravestones.
[192:23.20]Yeah, see, he fucking hates them too.
[192:24.72]He's pissed too.
[192:26.46]He's sitting there going like, why is this here?
[192:29.12]Who put this here?
[192:29.87]Why the fuck is this light post here?
[192:32.05]He's as mad as I am.
[192:33.59]Don't call me mad.
[192:34.35]He's mad too.
[192:41.03]I'm getting hit by the axe.
[192:42.69]Aye, aye, aye.
[193:11.57]It's hard to get that second dodge.
[193:21.01]It's gotta be perfect.
[193:32.92]No, dude, it's...
[194:19.15]Give me the other blade!
[194:20.07]Give me the other blade!
[194:42.09]Thank you for watching.
[195:10.78]Dude, come on!
[195:22.31]I'm a mad... I wonder, like... I don't know if you... Do you just dodge through it?
[195:26.61]I feel like you can still get hit by it.
[195:34.62]When he does the big fire thing, like, you have to run around him, right?
[195:37.76]You have to get around him, but you can't run to the left, because he'll just hit you with it.
[195:42.08]Did you dodge through it?
[195:43.42]Like, can I go through that fire?
[195:45.01]I feel like you can't.
[195:46.65]I tried jumping over it before, and you still get hit by, like, the residual hitbox.
[195:53.73]Like, you can jump over the fire?
[195:57.15]Can I actually jump it?
[195:58.17]You said last attempt.
[195:59.45]I'm a liar!
[196:00.99]I'm a liar.
[196:18.65]God fucking get the shit out of the god damn game.
[196:48.40]Come on, where's the blade?
[197:34.70]Ayayayayayayayayayayayay!
[197:52.79]Get rid of the fucking stupid scenery.
[197:55.54]Why is it here?
[198:18.91]What?
[198:39.56]Thank you.
[199:17.00]WHAT IS THAT ENDING?!
[199:18.72]WHAT?! !
[200:14.08]Do you understand why now?
[200:17.77]I- What the fuck is the point of some of this scenery sh- BULLSHIT!
[200:27.40]I'm sitting like in a fucking tree!
[200:29.59]I had to burn through like three or four flasks!
[200:33.15]That's so stupid!
[200:52.51]Ah!
[201:22.41]Oh, my God!
[202:13.26]it's not worth dying over
[202:44.35]No, he went the way that I was going.
[202:46.81]Jerry, he went my way.
[203:01.02]Run away.
[203:02.52]Far away.
[203:04.60]We cannot have you.
[203:29.91]No!
[203:51.79]Thanks for watching!
[204:32.15]Wowee, wowee, wowee, wowee.
[204:57.96]He had to do that right there!
[204:59.58]He had to do that right there!
[205:06.09]I tried to get up and like jump, but it was just too late.
[205:09.83]I was too- I was on the ground already.
[205:11.29]Oh man, I was right there.
[205:17.64]This is so unfortunate.
[205:18.56]Like, the fire thing, I can't jump over it.
[205:20.82]I can't... Dodging through it is hard, too.
[205:24.64]I... I... If I had mana or something... Fuck, man.
[205:28.53]Come on.
[205:30.01]Come on.
[205:44.24]so so
[206:18.25]SPRINT!
[207:01.85]I gotta dodge through it like that way.
[207:35.27]Oh, I'm so fucking far away.
[207:36.61]It's a different way.
[207:37.27]I'm good.
[208:34.88]God dammit, I still don't get it!
[208:37.50]I gotta get away from that shit!
[208:54.41]Dude, fuck you!
[208:55.51]A huge ass arm!
[208:56.97]Fuck off!
[209:08.35]Oh my fucking god, dude.
[209:10.57]I can't.
[209:11.23]I just, it's so much for my brain to handle.
[209:15.09]Just choking on those fucking moves.
[209:17.85]It's so annoying.
[209:19.17]I have to dodge right through the middle.
[209:38.87]What the fuck?
[209:46.01]He's... I don't... It's just like... Okay, so here's my problem.
[209:51.80]When he does the flame thing, right?
[209:55.24]It's like he... This two... That's why... It's like he has so many different random fucking ass moves.
[210:00.45]One of them is like a big cone in front of him, and the other one is like a big slow wave, and it's like, it's hard to tell which one of those fucking two stupid moves it's gonna be, because you can't dodge through the one that's in the front. ...
[210:27.42]Fuck that.
[211:08.92]No bleed?
[211:09.96]Where's the bleed, bro?
[211:11.20]Where's the bleed?
[211:12.30]Seriously?
[211:27.18]Where's the bleed?
[211:27.80]I hit him so many fucking times.
[211:34.64]One.
[211:35.84]Two.
[211:38.20]It's even fucking longer than that.
[211:39.97]Fuck this goddamn game!
[212:15.92]One!
[212:16.76]No!
[213:01.00]What?
[213:07.16]What the fuck, dude?
[213:38.84]No!
[213:49.26]What the fuck, man?
[213:56.84]Why didn't I dodge that?
[214:00.24]That was... I dodged right through it.
[214:07.11]And I got hit by a piece of fire that I'm gonna... I would like the referees to go back and fucking take a look and see if that actually happened.
[214:13.61]It's like the fire was gone and I like touched it with like my heel.
[214:24.62]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[214:47.62]Ah!
[214:49.65]Ah!
[215:22.10]Too late!
[215:22.70]Too late!
[216:02.63]Fuck you!
[216:03.23]I should've- my stamina bar was a little too low, friend!
[216:10.80]Dude, it's the stupid fucking gravestones.
[216:15.48]That was probably the one.
[216:17.17]Just getting like trapped behind fucking objects you can't walk through.
[216:21.35]And like the fact that everything has fucking collision and the collision is like a full square around the goddamn thing.
[216:28.32]It's like you just get stuck and they're everywhere.
[216:32.54]They're fucking everywhere.
[216:38.25]It's like, how are you supposed to fight this guy in a, like, fucking two-lane highway right here?
[216:46.33]That was absolutely the one.
[216:48.23]This guy's area just sucks.
[216:50.11]Like, asshole.
[216:51.17]Fuck this area.
[216:52.97]Fighting this guy here, different elevations, the gravestones, the gigantic dragon-ass tree that's here.
[217:00.32]You gotta fight this guy in, like, a 10-meter radius, like here.
[217:07.30]I'm go- I got it, I got it.
[217:08.53]This guy's fucking dead.
[217:12.85]This guy's fucking dead.
[217:14.79]You mad?
[217:15.33]Yeah!
[217:16.25]Cause that's like the fourth or fifth time that a run gets blown because there's a gravestone behind my body that I can't- I'm just dead.
[217:22.45]But I'm like up in the fucking vistas and shit, like there don't have to be so many down here!
[217:31.34]How many people have died here?! !
[217:35.42]How many gravestones are there in fucking Elden Ring?
[217:38.76]All right, let's go.
[217:51.54]I don't understand bleed.
[217:52.56]I really don't.
[217:53.14]That was like three auto attacks and it did bleed.
[217:56.36]I have done like 40 auto attacks and it doesn't happen.
[218:02.07]Is it a cooldown?
[218:10.42]What?
[218:10.78]Bad place to be.
[218:38.94]Get away.
[218:39.60]Get away.
[218:39.92]I'm just being fucking clumsy.
[219:30.44]I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive!
[219:42.13]God damn it, man.
[219:44.67]God fucking damn it.
[219:45.69]Like, the one move that he couldn't do in the one spot that he couldn't do it in.
[219:51.19]The one move that would have hit me when I get up, the instantly I fucking get up.
[220:01.44]Stay close to him.
[220:04.94]Dodging some of those AoE attacks that he has.
[220:08.46]He's gonna get trapped.
[220:16.61]Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[220:53.53]I need stamina.
[221:00.25]I need stamina.
[221:01.13]Alright.
[221:04.05]Fuck you!
[221:15.58]Fuck you!
[221:31.94]See, that's why.
[221:32.80]Like, and you get trapped in there.
[221:41.68]Like, what the fuck is hitting me behind?
[221:43.62]You can't go near him?
[221:46.40]Is it happening behind him too?
[221:49.13]Such bullshit.
[222:00.75]Fucking God, it's so much longer.
[222:04.14]Even when you think you're holding it for long enough, it's still not enough.
[222:06.80]I'm fucked now.
[222:23.93]So much variance in speed.
[222:31.77]One, two, wait!
[222:37.39]It's so hard to tell!
[222:55.78]I'm not going near him, man.
[223:08.72]No!
[223:09.10]Not again!
[223:37.87]What fuck you Oh
[224:04.33]Nooooooo!
[224:09.85]You can't- I thought- No, he stops and he does the two fireballs!
[224:13.39]Come on!
[224:16.34]He stops and he goes fireball, fireball, and the one time he fucking does it.
[224:20.24]There's just too much variance.
[224:24.50]It's like, how am I supposed to tell?
[224:26.02]Am I too far away?
[224:26.94]Am I too close?
[224:27.72]The fucking goddamn variables on these fights!
[224:34.07]Yeah, I know I have full mana, but man, I've got a thing going on here, and I'm doing well.
[224:37.57]Changing it up is bad.
[224:39.05]This shit's just so all over the place when it comes to speed and shit.
[225:00.84]I thought he was not gonna do another move.
[225:09.40]I would try to... Fuck you.
[225:19.19]Fuck you.
[225:41.02]Alright, alright, alright.
[225:41.98]Fuck you.
[225:44.12]Piece of fucking dog shit.
[226:02.25]You know what?
[226:02.95]I need to figure out what the actual strategy is there.
[226:05.63]Because I keep fucking it up.
[226:06.65]I just keep getting hit by it every time.
[226:42.20]OI!
[226:43.65]Get away from the fucking tree.
[226:45.43]I'm not having this happen again.
[226:57.00]What the fuck?
[226:59.06]Dude, come the fuck on.
[227:01.44]I don't care who you are.
[227:02.40]That's a stupid fucking move.
[227:04.23]I don't care who you are.
[227:05.51]I don't care what your complaint is.
[227:14.27]Come on!
[227:56.91]Wowie!
[228:26.06]FLEED!
[228:33.28]HOT!
[228:34.40]TOO HOT!
[228:43.00]HIT HIM!
[228:48.62]WHAT?!
[228:53.74]That guy sucks!
[229:04.85]That guy sucked!
[229:05.81]That guy sucked!
[229:06.55]This game is not even fucking ma- It's a great- I love it.
[229:13.15]What an experience.
[229:16.57]Really trying to get going and fight him and get him and kill him.
[229:20.15]That was a very, very interesting thing to do.
[229:23.14]We got him.
[229:24.34]It took a lot.
[229:24.98]It took a little bit of perseverance.
[229:26.02]It got a little heated there, but you know, it's okay.
[229:28.14]We got him.
[229:33.48]Fuck that guy.
[229:34.26]And fuck that area.
[229:35.50]Fuck those stones.
[229:36.86]Fuck the tree.
[229:37.74]Fuck the dragon on the tree.
[229:40.38]And it looks beautiful.
[229:41.92]But it's no place to fight.
[229:43.70]This is no place to fight a human.
[229:45.86]Or an animal.
[229:46.88]Or a beast.
[229:47.58]Or a legend.
[229:48.80]Or a fighter.
[229:49.63]It doesn't matter.
[229:50.39]I don't care what we're fighting.
[229:51.19]Let's pick another place.
[229:53.49]Like, I would walk in here and be like, dude, alright, you and I can fight.
[229:56.31]But, like, can we just, like, go, like, out in the open?
[229:58.87]Like, let's do, like, a fair fight.
[230:00.77]Let's go do, like, a duel, man.
[230:04.27]Dr. Seuss lyrics.
[230:10.17]That sucked!
[230:11.21]I just missed everything about that.
[230:15.07]What did that say?
[230:16.19]Remnants of Garfield.
[230:18.69]I missed that, literally, that whole thing.
[230:28.88]What did it say?
[230:29.38]Great Ruin?
[230:29.96]Can somebody explain it?
[230:30.74]I literally skipped it.
[230:34.42]I can't fucking... Dude, I almost died at the very end.
[230:37.15]I would have fucking eaten my controllers.
[230:40.93]Dude, I really would have eaten my controller.
[230:43.33]When I was just casting, and it just... Nothing was hitting him.
[230:46.65]Did you notice?
[230:47.39]I want you to rewind for a second.
[230:49.27]If you can, for a moment.
[230:51.21]It was hitting like a gravestone.
[230:53.79]It was like hitting this thing.
[230:57.16]It wasn't, though.
[230:58.12]It was just a little too far away.
[231:00.78]Like, I was out of range, but I thought it was hitting that thing.
[231:05.88]And I was sitting here just going, Bravestone Andy.
[231:10.26]You know what I mean?
[231:10.83]I was about to fucking flip out.
[231:16.35]I was gonna fucking freak out.
[231:17.87]I thought it was actually hitting that.
[231:24.57]These two main bosses so far have been fucking hell.
[231:31.12]God.
[231:31.58]Oh, the tutorial's there, okay.
[231:39.48]They both have this, like... I know, I've done this routine, like, ten times already.
[231:52.17]Alright.
[231:53.65]Let's go.
[231:55.73]Take a short break?
[231:56.33]Yeah, I will.
[231:57.53]I'm gonna get some more water.
[232:06.80]What do you think?
[232:08.28]Hey, so for those of you that were saying sorcery, hey, casual, you're a casual.
[232:14.13]I beat that guy pretty much without it.
[232:15.59]At the very end, I may have thrown out a little dingy at him, but I did that without sorcery.
[232:24.81]I need a break after watching that.
[232:31.28]Strength to 12, just to be able to use items.
[232:40.54]What do you mean that doesn't count?
[232:46.60]Um... Let's do 20, 20, 16.
[232:51.24]I must have enough.
[232:55.02]I can actually do it again.
[232:55.76]Take the power of its namesake via finger reader.
[233:10.01]Yeah, we're going to take a break in a sec.
[233:11.13]I just want to get situated.
[233:16.34]Oh, where is that thing?
[233:17.24]I have a question.
[233:22.46]How many of you guys watch the stream muted?
[233:25.00]So you don't have to listen to the guy complain for like an hour.
[233:30.21]At what point does the streamer die?
[233:32.97]Like 3, 4, 5, 6 times, 10 times, 15 times in a row?
[233:36.48]And then when they die?
[233:37.58]This is how I would do it.
[233:38.78]This is strats.
[233:40.18]So when the streamer dies for the 15th time, and his mouth goes... That's when you just mute.
[233:46.49]And he's going to sit there and be like...
[233:58.63]then when you when he goes into when they go into the boss door you unmute it so it just it's if you get to watch the stream normally that's like that's actually a good idea that's what I would be doing just me every okay if I die 10 times in a row to boss just mute me after I die
[234:28.82]You're always muted on my stream.
[234:33.78]Okay.
[234:36.11]Where is this item?
[234:42.93]It's like this... Primeval Stone or something?
[234:46.07]Whatever it was.
[234:48.84]Uses FP to mimic nearby objects.
[234:58.99]Where's this thing?
[235:04.69]Where is it?
[235:05.91]You got Godric's Great Rune.
[235:07.05]You need to take it to the tower.
[235:09.01]I got two things, though.
[235:15.48]I got two different things, didn't I?
[235:19.48]Or was that just explaining what that thing was?
[235:23.08]Okay.
[235:23.86]Alright, let's take a break.
[235:26.40]You got the rune and his soul.
[235:27.52]Alright, I'll be right back.
[235:28.42]I'm going to get some water.
[235:29.40]I'm going to get a refill of maybe some green tea.
[235:32.32]When I'm back, we'll keep going.
[235:36.08]I took a break.
[235:36.54]What happened?
[235:38.18]I gave up on the game.
[235:40.62]I just like a little too hard.
[235:41.48]I think it's just like too much.
[235:43.50]If they patch out... I haven't beat the guy.
[235:46.86]If they patch out like 10-20% of the gravestones, then maybe I'll come back and try it again.
[235:51.56]It's unfortunate, but I'm going to skip a break.
[235:53.12]When I come back, we'll play Picross.
[236:55.37]Thanks for watching!
[238:21.18]Thank you.
[243:11.01]Oh, I didn't loop it.
[243:12.93]I'm not even kidding, guys.
[243:14.10]I had to go change my clothes.
[243:16.10]I was wet.
[243:20.28]I was soaking wet.
[243:22.12]That shirt was as if somebody put it into the washing machine.
[243:32.87]Sorry that took a little bit longer than it should have, but I actually just had to change my clothes.
[243:40.24]I'm in, like, a different shirt now.
[243:41.80]I'm in, like, a Star Wars shirt.
[243:51.76]Okay.
[243:52.68]So, what's the last thing that just happened?
[243:54.49]I just fought... I just fought Godric the Gravestone.
[244:02.35]And that was an intense fight.
[244:04.45]I had to believe I was cooking up that one while I was taking a piss.
[244:10.85]Um... Okay.
[244:13.83]I need to put my lips to dry.
[244:24.63]Chatters are saying you smell like creamed corn.
[244:28.64]Um... I think I smell, like, kind of coconut-y.
[244:34.04]Um... With a hint of, like... A lavender.
[244:43.28]Like sewer gas.
[244:46.73]Okay.
[244:48.41]I can go that way or I can go back and start looking around.
[244:51.23]Let me see what's this way.
[244:54.21]Because, wait.
[245:01.48]I have his rune.
[245:05.06]I felt the same way.
[245:34.74]I mean, like, me and this guy could be the same person.
[245:39.23]Oh.
[245:40.87]Hello there.
[245:43.71]This weasel was...
[245:46.50]Godric was always looking down on me.
[245:50.14]He got what he bloody deserved thanks to you.
[245:53.37]You gonna give me anything?
[245:55.45]What goes around comes around.
[245:58.17]He had an ugly heart, an uglier countenance, and met the ugliest of ends, eh?
[246:06.91]I love how he laughs.
[246:12.15]It's just perfect.
[246:14.26]Now...
[246:15.73]I suppose I'm free.
[246:18.45]I can do whatever takes my fancy.
[246:23.37]Okay.
[246:24.01]Can I, mate?
[246:27.81]I guess you can.
[246:28.73]Now, I can do whatever.
[246:33.58]Can I?
[246:35.86]Okay, well.
[246:36.28]Yeah, he was a dick.
[246:38.08]Sure was.
[246:42.14]Anything over here that I need to see?
[246:49.22]I mean, that looks beautiful, but what do I need to see here?
[246:56.71]I can get those new sorceries, right?
[246:59.49]I'm looking over my notes.
[247:17.01]Read the Great Rune to see where to go next.
[247:19.07]I mean, I could just walk through here.
[247:20.23]I just want to make sure I didn't miss any items over here.
[247:27.03]Which I don't think I did.
[247:27.73]Because this is just the boss area.
[247:30.80]Alright.
[247:32.86]Let's just go in the front door.
[247:38.72]Four hours to beat a boss Andy?
[247:40.92]That's not the only thing I did.
[247:42.10]I explored around the castle a lot.
[247:47.30]Or what?
[247:49.66]Or what?
[247:50.30]Who cares?
[247:50.90]We can't attack in here?
[248:19.62]Are we behind that?
[248:20.30]I don't know.
[248:20.88]I guess I'm in... Is this the place where I was before?
[248:24.22]With the... The council?
[248:27.41]Can we see your character's face?
[248:38.71]Yeah.
[248:50.66]Pretty much all you need to know is he's got a long chin and a big nose.
[248:53.72]And that's pretty much every character I've ever made.
[248:56.22]Captain Hook.
[249:00.72]It does look like Captain Hook.
[249:02.00]Holy shit.
[249:03.04]Where were you yesterday?
[249:04.16]We really could have used you yesterday.
[249:08.92]It actually is Captain Hook.
[249:11.37]And I have the claw.
[249:20.63]Oh my god, I didn't even think about that.
[249:34.91]This warrants an Eren moment.
[249:36.51]Why?
[249:39.69]Shabiri... Shabiri... Shabiri Grape.
[249:46.61]Maiden, dear maiden, where are you?
[249:48.21]Please take my grapes.
[249:56.08]I have a few key items I really need to look at.
[250:03.92]Oh, this was not the only way I could go.
[250:06.24]So let me go the other way.
[250:07.14]Is it a joke here?
[250:18.74]Um...
[250:28.24]You know what I really messed up?
[250:31.51]I should have made Ernest.
[250:36.87]What was I thinking?
[250:40.13]I could have made Ernest.
[250:42.87]Instead I have Captain Hook.
[250:44.01]Is there really nothing else down here?
[250:51.00]I feel like something is going to be down here because why can I not swing?
[250:58.10]Okay, well, let's go.
[251:05.22]Oops.
[251:24.13]Okay, when I get out here, I'm going to finally get the use of my horse again.
[251:27.19]I feel like it's been ages since I've been able to get on my horse.
[251:31.15]Where am I?
[251:36.57]Okay.
[251:41.25]Where was the sorcerer?
[251:42.54]Okay, sorcery guy is here.
[251:48.48]What's the fastest way to get to him?
[251:52.73]Wait, what about after castle skip?
[251:58.91]Look at the menu.
[252:06.11]Oh, that's the green herb thing.
[252:09.67]Poison build up at HP.
[252:14.37]This is a weapon coding.
[252:18.21]Hello.
[252:19.27]Worthless rubbish?
[252:31.17]Okay.
[252:32.31]I gotta find the finger reader.
[252:43.00]Great rune of the Shardbearer Godric, devoid of any benediction.
[252:46.62]Seek the divine tower of Limgrave, which stands beyond the Great Bridge from Stormvale Castle.
[252:54.56]The Great Bridge from Stormvale Castle.
[252:58.60]Which is this way, right?
[253:01.02]Like, I'm just, I just keep going this way.
[253:02.46]I imagine it's just this way.
[253:09.89]Here.
[253:12.75]Or should I go to the bridge?
[253:15.95]It's the huge bridge.
[253:21.38]Oh, this bridge.
[253:24.56]Over here.
[253:28.46]Okay, I think the easiest place is probably to go here.
[253:30.68]Go to the tower.
[253:31.38]I'm going to go down and I'm going to buy some spells.
[253:39.89]And I have a few spells I want to buy.
[253:42.89]Let's get this on the map.
[253:47.23]Down here.
[253:47.67]I forget exactly where he is.
[253:49.88]I got two of these on the map.
[253:52.04]I don't want two.
[253:52.88]I just want one.
[253:55.14]Where's the other one?
[253:55.72]How do I clear all my stuff?
[254:02.71]How do I remove my beacons?
[254:06.85]Because I don't... I want... Okay, that's one.
[254:09.39]Oh, it's two.
[254:11.73]Okay, he's down there.
[254:14.51]I'm just gonna go that way.
[254:16.09]Trying to remember where he is.
[254:19.75]Where is this guy?
[254:20.33]A little bit of speed!
[254:25.05]Alright, I'm... I'm gonna die here if I'm not fucking careful.
[254:32.69]Easy, easy, easy.
[254:33.55]Alright, I can't just like stare at a map.
[254:49.04]This fucking dumbass camera!
[254:51.24]Oh my god!
[254:52.22]A little bit of shmeet.
[255:05.48]Where is he?
[255:06.22]He's like under here.
[255:07.14]Alright, you motherfuckers are really starting to piss me off.
[255:23.93]Enough!
[255:26.83]Okay.
[255:30.46]So he's down here.
[255:31.26]This doesn't hurt me.
[255:33.66]It doesn't kill me.
[255:37.14]Alright, dude.
[255:38.14]Where are you?
[255:40.76]I need you to teach me spells.
[255:47.40]Where is he?
[255:49.85]Where is he?
[255:50.19]Is he not here anymore?
[255:59.35]Does he go back here after you meet him?
[256:10.25]Not you.
[256:11.27]Not you.
[256:11.71]Not you.
[256:13.01]He just left.
[256:19.44]Where did he go?
[256:20.00]Not you.
[256:22.72]Oh, okay.
[256:26.18]There she is.
[256:26.54]I'm glad to see you here.
[256:35.34]I have something for you.
[256:36.34]I found it in Godric's grafting grounds.
[256:38.84]You defeated him.
[256:40.80]You should have it.
[256:42.00]Make good use of it.
[256:42.92]I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses.
[256:46.88]Arsenal charm.
[256:48.86]Ooh.
[256:49.34]Ah, yes.
[256:50.06]I wonder if you've met my foster father.
[256:52.38]He's in his study.
[256:53.90]The room Ensha's guarding just over there.
[256:56.30]If you haven't already, Father is the leader of the Round Table.
[257:00.40]I'm sure talking to him will be... What the hell just happened?
[257:07.20]Raises maximum equipment load.
[257:11.98]You might as well just use it.
[257:17.05]Not you.
[257:29.47]Door's closed.
[257:31.89]Oh, I'm gonna look at the painting.
[257:38.70]A pleasure to meet you.
[257:39.96]My name is Roderica.
[257:42.57]I'm a recent arrival.
[257:43.75]Who's this?
[257:44.51]Isn't this place impressive?
[257:47.25]The round table hold.
[257:49.75]Covert quarters of the two fingers.
[257:52.85]And gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord.
[257:57.02]I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us tarnished had such fantastic root, although...
[258:03.60]It's all a bit much for me, in truth.
[258:06.60]I'm still looking for my own purpose.
[258:09.10]Your spells?
[258:09.54]It's all a bit much for me, in truth.
[258:13.21]I'm still looking for... Do you have any spells?
[258:17.61]Who has spells for Captain Hook?
[258:23.61]Oh, it's this person.
[258:24.43]Are you that new tarnish?
[258:29.15]You've done well.
[258:32.55]Oh!
[258:34.90]It's the finger reader.
[258:35.86]Okay.
[258:46.81]The fingers tremble to welcome you, Shadbear.
[258:53.27]What is that?
[258:54.27]Let the wisdom wash over you.
[258:57.79]Why is there a hand here?
[258:58.85]Great Elden Ring, root of the Golden Order, anchor of all lands, giver of grace, wellspring of all.
[259:12.43]Until it was shattered, the tragic corruption of the Order has taken its toll.
[259:19.93]Across the realm, life lies in ruin, fallen to pieces.
[259:27.52]Foul curses and misery spread.
[259:32.32]Oops, I'm sorry.
[259:55.43]Seek another of its kind.
[259:56.55]Ugh.
[259:56.73]Ooh, I don't like this.
[259:58.89]I don't like this.
[259:59.71]This is weird.
[260:27.48]Touch the two fingers.
[260:30.99]Rapture.
[260:34.69]What the hell?
[260:35.53]That's so weird.
[260:40.62]Well, well, I see.
[260:45.12]A remembrance of gold has found its way into your possession.
[260:51.53]Attack it?
[260:52.61]I feel like that's like attacking the world stone.
[260:57.31]So this is probably boss shards, boss weapons.
[261:23.22]Strength of the fingers?
[261:25.25]Whose hand is this, though?
[261:26.41]Oh, great runes.
[261:47.39]children of the goddess queen marika she who is vessel of the elden ring tainted by the strength of their wounds her children ward but none could become elden lord and so grace was extended to your kind listen the fingers speak
[262:13.15]The greater will has long renounced the demigods.
[262:18.64]Tarnished.
[262:20.28]Show no mercy.
[262:22.22]Have their heads.
[262:25.11]Take all they have left.
[262:30.14]What are you talking through?
[262:32.66]Imagine if there was like Cheeto dust all over these.
[262:37.91]I don't know why this is not even... Whatever.
[263:07.54]That's the only thing I can say in, like, the ten minutes we've been walking around.
[263:11.24]With the power of remembrance menu, you can draw out the power of a remembrance namesake.
[263:16.74]Each remembrance can provide one power.
[263:19.07]Once that power is claimed, the remembrance will be lost.
[263:23.51]Axe of Godric or whatever that thing is.
[263:29.95]Can I see what it looks like?
[263:30.97]Okay.
[263:33.14]Grafted dragon?
[263:41.48]Faith scaling.
[263:42.48]What is that?
[263:46.96]It's faith.
[263:47.60]It's not intelligence.
[263:50.54]Unfortunately.
[263:52.76]It's the fist.
[263:53.72]If only I knew that.
[263:56.48]You're doing a faith strength build?
[264:00.98]Well, I believe you've just seen something that you should be using.
[264:08.78]What if I don't want these?
[264:10.31]Can I just break it?
[264:13.02]Or do I have to use that?
[264:17.24]Is it like the other games?
[264:18.04]Like, can I just smack shit and eat it?
[264:23.95]I can just eat it for money, right?
[264:28.37]You can turn it into runes just, yeah, just like all the other games?
[264:32.19]Yeah.
[264:32.97]I mean, I can't use either one of those things.
[264:34.84]I'm just gonna use it.
[264:38.98]Yeah, that's it, of course.
[264:41.94]20,000 runes?
[264:42.30]Are you serious?
[264:44.41]I mean it would have been cool.
[264:46.03]That dragon arm thing is probably awesome.
[264:49.78]Is there anything else you need me to do?
[264:51.88]So this is the boss soul person.
[264:53.16]Alright.
[264:58.24]Fingers are here.
[265:01.56]I'm gonna level up again.
[265:02.46]I hope somebody has a staff.
[265:09.97]Do that gesture in front of the fingers.
[265:11.51]Really?
[265:17.27]What do you do, Jester?
[265:27.38]Where's Rapture?
[265:51.36]This is like what everybody's cat does.
[265:52.82]It's like you look down and the cat's just there.
[265:56.44]Like, pick me up.
[266:05.30]It's like you look down and the cat's just on your leg like, I'm coming up here.
[266:07.74]Okay, that was cool.
[266:14.59]Don't hurt that.
[266:16.83]That was very strange.
[266:17.89]It's all right.
[266:21.68]Uppies.
[266:22.58]Uppies.
[266:25.16]Rest at... Oh, I can rest here.
[266:29.76]I knew I could.
[266:47.43]I'm not sure what to do.
[266:49.45]Because there's a theory of...
[266:52.59]Dumping it into Endurance and Vitality.
[266:54.37]I feel like it's been a while.
[267:02.01]But, I feel like I'm falling behind a lot on damage right now.
[267:06.93]Fighting Godric, I feel like I was not doing enough damage.
[267:10.68]I think I need to start... I really need to find that Sorcerer.
[267:16.34]Because he had that weapon and that move...
[267:23.68]Maybe some more mana.
[267:24.40]Alright, we're going to do two in Endurance.
[267:31.10]Get Endurance for 15 and we'll get Mind up to 14.
[267:37.51]And then I saved those souls because I need to find that guy because I got to get some of these new abilities.
[267:44.83]Because that magic sword is essentially what I'll be using for the most of the game, I would assume.
[267:53.55]I don't want a hug.
[267:56.47]I know where the sorcerer is, but I won't tell you.
[267:58.01]That's alright.
[268:10.36]I wonder if he's not here.
[268:16.28]Why aren't you upset?
[268:19.58]Um...
[268:21.96]I mean, if you want to watch me upset, just rewind the VOD by like 15 to 20 minutes.
[268:28.96]And watch me just absolutely call out every single thing I don't like about this game.
[268:34.90]It's the hardest game at Walmart.
[268:36.03]Yeah, it is.
[268:39.97]Okay, there was a lot of back and forth about what I said during Dark Souls 3, I believe.
[268:46.97]I talked about how fucking impossible the game was.
[268:49.33]The game is so hard.
[268:50.41]It's too hard.
[268:52.19]And I said it was the hardest game.
[268:54.08]I was like, it's the hardest game ever made.
[268:56.92]It's like the hardest game you can buy or whatever.
[268:58.74]And people were like, oh, dude, what about like Boshi?
[269:02.22]And I was like, okay, fine.
[269:03.78]So it's like the hard... We came to the conclusion that it's the hardest fucking game at Walmart, okay?
[269:08.97]It's the hardest game at Target.
[269:11.06]Okay, it's not like some crazy, like, impossible game that was made.
[269:15.56]It's, but, it's, what do you want me to say?
[269:18.93]It was Sekiro, yeah, it was Sekiro.
[269:20.35]Not Dark Souls 3, it was Sekiro.
[269:21.87]And Sekiro was fucking brutal.
[269:27.83]This is open now.
[269:32.19]Oh, this guy will talk to me now.
[269:33.59]Do you like this more than Sekiro?
[269:35.41]Yes.
[269:35.51]I like... Okay.
[269:58.64]As such, I ask that you remain constant.
[270:02.12]I need to see a few more of the bosses.
[270:04.10]Like some of the main story bosses.
[270:07.16]Because as it stands right now, the first two main story bosses, I feel like we're very similar.
[270:15.80]I want to see more before I have an opinion of the bosses in this game.
[270:20.15]There's a story?
[270:23.63]Yeah.
[270:23.75]Yeah.
[270:30.70]Okay, so what do you... Great Runes.
[270:37.78]Sekiro's boss fights were crazy.
[270:41.59]And the thing about Sekiro was like you... Like the revive feature was very interesting.
[270:49.13]So even though the game was really difficult.
[270:51.41]And it was really brutal.
[270:53.53]Like the fact that you come back to life like two, three times sometimes was really... Like that was really forgiving.
[270:59.22]So those are all the people that have the Great Runes.
[271:04.02]This is where I need to ask where they are.
[271:05.84]I heard about the Academy.
[271:25.54]Oh wait, no.
[271:26.08]Huh?
[271:26.20]Huh?
[271:48.41]Who is Godric?
[271:48.73]Okay.
[271:48.83]Because he's dead.
[271:49.19]Alright, where... I want to hear about the Academy.
[271:50.39]Because that's where I want to go.
[271:52.37]That's the Sorcerer Academy.
[272:14.58]The famed Red Lion and Scourge of the Stars.
[272:17.86]He fought Melania and her Rots who are standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave East.
[272:23.08]Caelid Wilds, Limgrave East.
[272:24.82]And now Caelid has been engulfed by the Scarlet Rot.
[272:27.31]Even approaching the region is no mean feat.
[272:30.29]I've heard survivors of Redan's army are still in the Wilds.
[272:33.89]Okay.
[272:34.57]East.
[272:35.15]And if it's true, I say so.
[272:38.31]I doubt he much resembles his former self.
[272:40.66]Okay.
[272:42.17]I want to know where... I want to know where this person is.
[272:46.69]Go to the Urge Tree.
[272:47.63]Nope.
[272:48.05]Why?
[272:48.21]Okay, so that's like a hard boss.
[272:50.09]Where's this person?
[272:50.73]No, no, no, no.
[272:51.07]Not you.
[273:12.17]Okay, that's where I want to go.
[273:15.11]North.
[273:15.51]Okay.
[273:16.05]So we're gonna go north.
[273:17.31]Amber egg.
[273:17.59]It's an egg.
[273:38.70]Alright, that's where I want to go.
[273:39.44]We gotta go north.
[273:40.96]I believe I was already accidentally kind of going that way.
[273:43.95]Here.
[273:45.79]But where's the... Where's the sorceress?
[273:50.57]Where's the sorcery guy?
[273:52.43]Is he in a different spot?
[273:58.23]Somewhere else?
[274:00.09]I will.
[274:09.01]Oh, you know what?
[274:09.41]We can probably fight this person again.
[274:10.45]Now that I actually have, like, moves.
[274:20.45]Did I kill this person?
[274:45.11]Oh, okay.
[274:47.67]Is this BM?
[274:48.77]That's BM.
[275:01.18]Okay.
[275:18.41]I'm seeing if I can call the boys down here.
[275:39.83]You can't even swing that many times in a row in this game!
[275:44.95]You can't swing that many times in a row!
[275:46.78]You just can't swing that many times in a row.
[275:50.35]We have to all play by the same rules and we don't.
[276:11.40]See you, motherfucker.
[276:12.50]Let's go.
[276:16.94]What is this fucking double frostbite?
[276:42.23]I'll get him.
[276:46.38]If I kill you, do I get that frost move?
[276:48.20]Because I will do whatever it takes to get you.
[277:01.39]Oh my god.
[277:03.13]I forgot that those weren't spent.
[277:07.55]Oh my fucking god, are you kidding me?
[277:11.40]I thought that they... I...
[277:15.19]why is that sorcerer not in this fucking building I can't fuck it we were like talking about something and I just whatever I'm killing this guy
[277:46.57]come on!
[278:02.69]That sucks.
[278:05.46]I can't believe I did that.
[278:19.92]What's with the BM?
[278:21.10]He actually drank a potion.
[278:22.96]God damn it.
[278:27.06]How dare he do that?
[278:30.94]I'll get him.
[278:31.26]We gotta prepare him a couple times.
[278:33.89]I can't believe I actually just dumped 7,000 souls into the ground.
[278:55.91]Ah, we meet again after all.
[278:57.85]I apologize for any offense given by my bearing, but I'm quite unable to move, you see.
[279:04.55]So, what do you need?
[279:17.06]Ah, you defeated Godric and claimed yourself a great rune.
[279:21.95]Looks like we both got what we wanted out of Stormvale, didn't we?
[279:25.69]Well done, friend.
[279:27.51]Something to mark the occasion.
[279:29.91]Go on.
[279:31.15]Ooh.
[279:33.59]What are you giving me?
[279:35.01]What?
[279:35.25]You're giving me a plus eight item?
[279:37.91]As you might have guessed, I still can't move.
[279:41.17]My fighting days are behind me.
[279:43.35]No need to be polite.
[279:44.51]Holy shit.
[279:45.05]There's no use for it anymore.
[279:47.51]What is that?
[279:49.25]Dude, why does this have to happen to me?
[279:51.31]You were sitting in the one spot that he's like hiding in this place.
[279:55.97]Like, okay, I thought it was just a balcony.
[279:57.88]I didn't think there was a guy sitting against the wall dressed as the guy in the painting and he's wearing the clothes that Blades wear in the same color scheme.
[280:08.89]What is that?
[280:16.67]Plus eight?
[280:18.67]Sea scaling?
[280:19.79]Oh, it's a thrusting sword.
[280:21.61]That was some Walter White panic moment.
[280:43.01]It's actually one of these things, but it's the best thing I have right now.
[280:50.69]so so
[281:21.16]Get away from me!
[281:33.87]Tried to parry a jumping attack.
[281:35.25]I can't fucking believe it.
[281:37.61]Honestly, just like have them stand up.
[281:40.12]Just have them all stand in a line next to each other, shoulder to shoulder.
[281:46.78]Like, why can't they all just be sitting at the round table?
[281:49.04]Like, oh, I'm Godric.
[281:50.54]I'm, uh... I'm Bodric.
[281:54.08]I'm Godric.
[281:55.98]Oh, yes, we're here.
[281:57.14]Strategizing.
[281:58.87]I don't know why I have to go look for him.
[282:04.03]I can't believe he's just sitting over here.
[282:05.47]I thought actually, like, in some of the Souls games, the NPCs move around.
[282:11.33]And sometimes they're in one spot, then they're in another area entirely.
[282:18.17]Save scum, you souls.
[282:19.13]It's too late now.
[282:38.00]And the name of God is that.
[282:40.93]Whoa, that's kind of cool.
[283:00.05]Actually cool.
[283:04.47]The only problem is it's... It's a thrust weapon.
[283:11.32]Thank you.
[283:33.22]so so so
[284:11.51]Mad tongue has died.
[284:15.27]Haunter's tongue.
[284:23.27]This thing actually is kind of good.
[284:25.45]I'll hold on to it.
[284:35.68]Wow, 1500 ruins.
[284:49.42]Hey.
[284:50.76]Thanks for the sword.
[284:53.76]I would like the... It's 2,500.
[284:55.54]I can't afford it.
[284:58.76]Is there more down there?
[285:00.22]Is there more stuff down here?
[285:01.10]I don't see anything.
[285:14.47]I can sell some stuff.
[285:15.29]Yeah, I will.
[285:15.97]What else is down here?
[285:21.02]These doors can't open.
[285:23.16]Bro.
[285:28.58]Uh, I'm gonna sell some stuff to get $2,500 to buy that, at least the greatsword one.
[285:32.54]Because that is a really good move.
[285:38.98]Who can I sell to?
[285:44.60]Uh, you, right?
[285:46.14]I like this guy.
[285:47.34]This is my favorite NPC.
[285:49.80]The reason why this guy's my favorite NPC is because he stays fucking put, and he sits out in the open where I can see him.
[286:00.43]Is that guy- who do you sell stuff to?
[286:02.49]Oh, the blacksmith.
[286:09.09]Are they- be careful.
[286:10.25]Now, lay out.
[286:25.33]Maybe some of these weapons that I know I'm not going to use.
[286:27.48]Only 100?
[286:27.66]That's it?
[286:28.48]I mean, I'm absolutely not going to use this.
[286:31.88]Or this.
[286:33.48]It's a really cool weapon, but it's going to leave.
[286:35.68]I'm not going to use it.
[286:41.55]What do I need?
[286:42.45]2,500? 2,500?
[287:02.12]I want to keep that.
[287:14.29]Never sell gear because it could come in handy.
[287:18.49]What about some of this shit?
[287:22.89]Attempts invasion of other players' worlds.
[287:24.67]I'm not going to do that.
[287:25.57]24.
[287:38.38]God damn it.
[287:40.72]Okay, 2400.
[287:46.64]Uh, I mean, I don't, I'm not going to use this.
[287:49.14]Meat dumpling, it gives you poison.
[287:51.06]It hurts.
[287:51.40]Let me buy the great sword.
[287:58.46]Missed a room.
[287:59.36]Somebody said I missed a room.
[288:02.65]A room.
[288:02.91]I can't believe I just walked down there and just died.
[288:11.05]Always good, Simon.
[288:13.99]Alright, this is what I want.
[288:15.33]I want this thing.
[288:16.41]Grands Affinities.
[288:17.35]Yeah, yeah.
[288:20.75]Thank you.
[288:22.09]That thing is amazing.
[288:23.87]From what I remember, it's sort of like a melee weapon.
[288:29.63]I'm going to remove this and put it on this.
[288:36.18]Where is it?
[288:42.98]Wait, is that the same thing?
[288:44.42]Wait, what's going on?
[288:48.95]It's a weapon skill?
[288:52.71]Oh.
[288:54.89]Oh.
[288:56.96]An ash of war.
[288:57.80]Where is it?
[289:12.86]Where is it?
[289:14.14]It's not.
[289:27.01]Okay.
[289:28.61]Ash of war or ashes.
[289:30.89]So this different ash of war and ashes.
[289:34.54]So how do I put that on again?
[289:37.60]You can change it, right?
[289:48.27]How do I change my Ashen War?
[289:51.83]There's so many random fucking things in this game.
[289:54.28]I have to go to the blacksmith?
[289:56.14]Can't do it just on my menu?
[290:02.92]Oh wait, I need to... Alright.
[290:06.08]Blacksmithing needs to be a greatsword.
[290:07.59]What?
[290:10.69]What?!
[290:12.47]What?!
[290:13.81]WHAT?! !
[290:17.85]It needs to be a greatsword?
[290:19.85]I thought it was a magical greatsword.
[290:24.73]What the fuck?
[290:30.19]No, it doesn't.
[290:30.89]Okay.
[290:34.77]So this is magic.
[290:37.61]There it is.
[290:39.31]You guys just gave me a heart attack.
[290:42.93]Okay, let me see how it works.
[290:52.75]I wish I could just swing the weapon here.
[290:55.49]So, let me put the spell back.
[290:57.99]Okay.
[291:03.50]It's time to go.
[291:04.64]I missed the room.
[291:06.94]Go down.
[291:09.44]Go down, then up.
[291:11.94]From where?
[291:16.31]Down, then up?
[291:20.25]What if I go down over the balcony?
[291:24.43]What are you talking?
[291:24.93]Go down, then up?
[291:29.15]Are you guys, are you trolling?
[291:40.98]Oh.
[291:50.81]There's a dead person in here.
[291:56.08]What is that?
[292:05.44]It's a holy faith thing.
[292:07.32]There's so much cool shit that's dropping that has nothing to do with sorcery.
[292:14.75]Can I get a cool sorcery item?
[292:22.49]I want like a staff or something.
[292:29.45]Alright, I'm going back.
[292:30.71]Time to progress.
[292:33.86]He's finding out that no one likes magic.
[292:37.12]That's not true.
[292:47.70]Alright, so.
[292:49.32]It's time.
[292:54.24]I want to go over here.
[292:58.60]This big lake, it's a huge thing to explore.
[293:01.76]I'm going that way.
[293:03.18]And if anybody has a... If anybody has a problem with that, you're going to get banned.
[293:09.92]Okay?
[293:10.10]If anybody has an issue with that, you're going to get banned.
[293:14.88]I'm not going to listen to that.
[293:17.16]I'm not going to listen to people kind of say, don't fucking do that.
[293:21.14]Go play like the main campaign.
[293:23.90]Get banned.
[293:25.40]See you later, Sayonara.
[293:26.12]You know what I mean?
[293:27.80]Bye-bye.
[293:29.82]Oh, where'd you go?
[293:30.52]Bye-bye.
[293:30.86]Alright, let's go to the water.
[293:43.08]Let's make this our site to rest.
[293:47.47]We're getting toxic.
[293:50.11]Oh my god!
[293:50.61]Guys, the horse is back!
[294:01.96]A little camp.
[294:03.56]Alright.
[294:03.84]I haven't been to this camp.
[294:05.26]Let's go for it.
[294:05.84]This is my favorite part of the game so far.
[294:07.34]539 damage on a backstab.
[294:32.39]Oh my god, he swings so slow.
[294:38.41]It's just bullshit.
[294:39.76]Stop swinging so slow, dude.
[294:41.72]It's so impossible to decipher.
[294:45.88]This thing does a lot of damage.
[294:53.51]It's actually pretty good, but it's kind of hard to use.
[294:55.71]Okay, cookbook.
[294:57.37]I gotta look at those.
[295:11.50]Hey, fuck you.
[295:22.56]Cheating.
[295:26.36]Alright, so can I get on the horse?
[295:34.26]Oh, he's getting away.
[295:35.62]What?
[295:41.08]I'm sorry!
[295:41.74]Ooh.
[295:41.82]Alright, that was a little cool little camp.
[296:02.41]Anything else here?
[296:06.97]Be careful.
[296:11.13]Frozen raisins.
[296:15.89]This just seems like kind of delicious.
[296:17.25]Okay.
[296:34.55]All right, so this is a telescope thing over here.
[296:36.65]I want to see what that is, too.
[296:37.79]There's nothing else here, I don't think.
[296:43.05]Let's head towards that telescope.
[296:58.45]Is it?
[296:58.65]All right, to the right?
[297:04.31]There's this thing here.
[297:05.29]I don't know what it is.
[297:05.97]It's this, like, telescope-looking thing.
[297:13.57]What is that?
[297:14.03]I don't... What is it?
[297:28.90]Nothing?
[297:29.28]Not really?
[297:29.66]Maybe nighttime?
[297:39.21]Maybe it's night time.
[297:39.87]Alright, well here's the lake.
[297:43.11]I wanted to explore this because look at that.
[297:45.27]There's a bunch of cool shit over here.
[297:46.17]I don't know.
[297:57.74]What was that?
[298:07.90]It's right there?
[298:08.64]It's not a telescope, dude.
[298:18.23]Ooh!
[298:24.71]Ow.
[298:41.04]This is a- this is like a f- this is like a campfire!
[298:43.40]Shut up!
[299:23.07]Where the fuck is my horse?
[299:24.91]I'm trying... I like... The camera just spun around.
[299:34.76]Just to go back here and get on the horse.
[299:36.76]There's no... I can't see this fucking telescope.
[299:42.77]I'm spamming because there's people in every direction and there's a guy on a fucking horse just running around, just rampant, just running around the circle around me.
[299:55.71]I'm just going to the fucking lake where I wanted to go in the first place and not get distracted by the thing that's not even here.
[300:12.44]I'm telling you, there's nothing fucking here.
[300:23.44]This is it?!
[300:27.41]Why is this so huge?!
[300:29.49]I thought it was a huge thing!
[300:51.90]Alright, relax.
[300:58.97]This is cool, though.
[301:08.37]Why am I so high in the air?
[301:09.42]Oh.
[301:11.00]I want to go there.
[301:23.60]After the lake.
[301:24.30]I'm going to the fucking lake.
[301:26.28]Nothing's going to stop me now.
[301:28.45]I'm just... I'm driving right into it.
[301:30.61]I'm not going to do anything else.
[301:31.43]I'm just literally going to drive into the lake.
[301:32.89]And nothing's going to distract me.
[301:38.69]Okay, here we are.
[301:49.60]Hit the fucking thing.
[301:55.51]Fuck!
[302:07.62]Come on!
[302:10.48]Hey!
[302:11.28]Boys!
[302:12.48]Let's go!
[302:13.02]Looks like we got ourselves a fight!
[302:47.29]don't get stomped on oh somebody's still dead uh-oh does that mean just hit him with something
[303:15.68]Oh!
[303:53.20]Where are the boys?
[303:55.66]It says they're all still alive.
[304:01.48]Where did they go?
[304:06.63]One of them died.
[304:11.49]Oh shit.
[304:16.49]Fuck!
[304:17.89]Where's my horsey?
[304:19.31]Where's the horse?
[304:19.87]Where's the horse?
[304:20.37]Where's the horse?
[304:22.92]I'm good man, we're cool.
[304:31.63]Oh shit!
[304:32.89]Oh shit!
[304:54.40]You fucking can't be serious!
[305:00.76]How do I- I'm stabbing down with this stupid thrusting weapon!
[305:09.84]Hey, instead of going like this, go like this!
[305:14.09]What is this turtle?
[305:15.45]Get the fuck away from me!
[305:21.21]Where's the dragon?
[306:09.25]Oh, you're playing Dark Souls?
[306:15.42]Hey, son, what game you playing?
[306:18.42]Oh, I wonder.
[307:46.69]What the shit?
[308:01.40]No, no, get on the horse.
[308:04.48]What's happening?
[308:12.15]Get away from these gravestones.
[308:13.89]Get away from these glorified gravestones.
[308:25.96]OH MY GOD!
[308:32.65]WHERE THE FUCK DID HE JUST GO?!
[308:38.37]EXCUSE ME VIDEO GAME?!
[308:40.57]EXCUSE ME GAME OF THE- OF VIDEO DEGREES?!
[308:44.07]EXCUSE ME THE VIDEO GAME?!
[308:46.05]YOU CAN'T JUST DISAPPEAR?!
[308:48.34]THAT'S WHAT WE CALL CHEATING IN THIS INDUSTRY!
[308:51.02]THAT'S WHAT WE CALL CHEATING!
[308:53.46]DIE!
[309:02.25]Get the fuck away from me!
[309:03.03]What was that?
[309:03.51]A new draconic power is available.
[309:05.65]A draconic power is available.
[309:07.47]You've got a new draconic power.
[309:13.01]Where are the boys this whole time?
[309:19.76]Where are they?
[309:25.44]Ellas?
[309:28.22]They have 100% HP.
[309:33.55]That was insane.
[309:34.51]The D spawn, that was so fucking dumb.
[309:38.51]That was so stupid.
[309:40.95]Why?
[309:46.02]They went away from the dragon.
[309:48.70]This game's gonna make me lose my fucking mind, I swear to God.
[309:53.56]They went to the bar.
[309:58.92]I really want to know where they are.
[310:00.62]They all have full health.
[310:02.90]I'm like, alright boys, let's get the dragon.
[310:05.78]They all turn and run.
[310:06.87]Get your souls, yeah.
[310:15.89]Where are they?
[310:20.18]Where are my souls?
[310:28.46]Well, that actually is a turtle.
[310:31.08]I'm not gonna kill it.
[310:31.88]I'm sorry.
[310:38.76]Like, we're up there.
[310:39.52]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[310:51.67]That despawn, seriously, was such a... That was kind of lame.
[310:54.85]I'll be honest.
[310:56.09]I'm assuming he probably has, like, a timer?
[310:59.25]Or... A... I don't know.
[311:03.40]Like, maybe you can't... He can't go out of the area?
[311:05.52]Fuck everybody over here.
[311:25.42]It's an area thing.
[311:26.14]I mean, that was really funny, but that almost cost me the whole encounter.
[311:29.78]Cool, okay.
[311:34.10]Alright, let me keep looking over there.
[311:41.71]If you didn't have a range, you'd be able to terrify the whole map.
[311:44.43]That'd be kind of crazy, though, if you're just flying around.
[311:50.37]Something else that I noticed, too, that I didn't really have to worry about before.
[311:54.48]So, if the horse is dead, you have to confirm that you want to use it on the horse.
[311:59.68]It was kind of weird.
[312:04.68]I just got shot with a gun.
[312:05.86]Like, that was a bullet.
[312:15.36]I got something new.
[312:16.08]What is it?
[312:20.33]Aiden armor?
[312:20.91]Ooh, it looks kind of cool.
[312:27.71]Same thing.
[312:31.11]Uh, Greaves?
[312:36.92]Okay, I look cool.
[312:38.22]Let's explore the lake.
[312:59.36]These guys get pretty good souls, and they're simple.
[313:03.66]Oh, they don't?
[313:04.64]Okay, I just lied to you.
[313:06.01]Okay, I just... Crab gets his own music?
[313:25.16]I need my sorcerer's thing.
[313:28.40]I need my sorcerer's thing.
[313:30.14]And I can't use it because it's on two hands.
[313:43.86]Stop!
[313:46.94]Oh my god!
[313:48.34]Oh my god!
[313:50.10]Droger's voice in the last few years has started to sound like this!
[313:58.56]Crab eggs.
[314:07.03]I don't know, the older I got, like, the more of a Mickey Mouse voice I have.
[314:10.29]Like, when I yell.
[314:11.87]I don't know what happened.
[314:14.32]I used to be like, Gah!
[314:15.64]Whoa!
[314:16.82]Now I'm like, Whoa!
[314:18.72]Like, Paul Bearer.
[314:19.92]Like, why do I have a Paul Bearer voice now?
[314:21.90]What happened?
[314:25.74]Oh, look around!
[314:27.16]I can't believe it!
[314:28.63]The dragon's breathing fire!
[314:31.77]The Undertaker!
[314:32.89]Like, what happened to my voice?
[314:34.01]What fucking happened?
[314:36.25]Ooh.
[314:37.77]Tunnels.
[315:00.80]You're starting to sound like a gingerbread man in Shrek.
[315:04.84]Bring it back up.
[315:07.45]Bring it back up, because did you see that?
[315:10.43]Did you see it?
[315:23.08]At the left side of your screen.
[315:26.02]An orb.
[315:26.48]An orb.
[315:31.26]Alright, we're doing health.
[315:33.08]No, we're gonna buy new spells.
[315:54.15]What side was it on?
[316:03.03]Alright.
[316:03.75]Hold on here.
[316:04.33]This is dangerous.
[316:05.29]Is there something on the ceiling?
[316:17.94]I think there's something on the ceiling.
[316:29.65]That's it?
[316:37.54]Okay.
[316:41.14]It's just a rune.
[316:45.92]That's too... Where's the elevator?
[316:48.95]What happened to the elevator?
[316:51.79]Where's the elevator?
[316:52.79]Did it go up?
[316:57.33]It went up.
[317:06.17]With my souls.
[317:08.41]How do I get the elevator to come back down?
[317:15.30]Is there a lever?
[317:16.00]How do... I can't get the elevator back.
[317:17.38]Oh.
[317:18.62]Oh.
[317:31.94]Hurry the fuck up.
[317:32.70]Hurry the fuck up.
[317:35.64]Alright, I'm very mad, and I'm gonna pretend to be very angry.
[317:38.78]And, like, actually, like, not, like, fun or, like, funny angry, like, messing around.
[317:43.20]Like, really actually angry.
[317:44.92]Okay?
[318:01.19]What the
[318:14.25]It's... It's that far of a drop?
[318:19.81]It's not though.
[318:20.97]Why did that... I went through like a wind tunnel.
[318:28.25]Dude, why is this so far?
[318:33.05]Is this gonna kill me if I land right here?
[318:40.71]I'm just trying to die to a place where they spawn...
[318:55.65]Now.
[318:56.69]Bro.
[318:57.27]Bro, somebody said, bro, fall joke central.
[319:01.31]No, I'm not trying to do fall joke central.
[319:03.63]I'm trying to simply just get the souls and just come back down here.
[319:15.53]No, it's fucking there.
[319:16.85]Give it to me.
[319:19.10]Okay, so I can't do this.
[319:21.88]I have to go up here.
[319:23.46]I can't do anything.
[319:26.71]I can't do anything.
[319:27.81]How am I supposed to get down?
[319:28.59]Is there something I can jump on from here?
[319:31.33]What can I jump on from here?
[319:37.17]There it is.
[319:42.85]Okay.
[319:43.89]We're okay now.
[319:45.89]Sorry about that.
[319:46.73]It's just a little problem.
[319:52.67]Let's continue to find out what the heck is down here.
[319:58.48]Although I do... Now that I'm not fighting a boss.
[320:01.21]Let's get this situated.
[320:03.81]Because I am a magician.
[320:09.57]No, no.
[320:10.27]We call it magician here.
[320:11.61]Mage.
[320:12.21]Oh, you're a mage.
[320:12.91]No, you're a magician.
[320:15.37]Okay.
[320:29.67]The hell is going on down here?
[320:43.06]Oh, these... A lot of smithing stones.
[320:44.63]That's what they're getting.
[320:51.47]Oh, you were way more dangerous looking than I thought.
[320:58.12]You're all way more...
[321:06.72]This is awesome.
[321:07.46]This is where I can finally get some materials.
[321:09.73]Okay, another tunnel.
[321:27.96]Which way should I go?
[321:28.62]I'm thinking this way.
[321:39.05]Rats.
[322:00.42]I think stone.
[322:02.15]I'm really happy the game actually gave me an upgraded weapon.
[322:05.89]So many people that aren't doing this exact stupid thing that I'm doing.
[322:09.15]Well, it's not that stupid, but like the intelligence and dex is that's what this weapon's for.
[322:14.31]So a ton of people are getting this and see plus eight.
[322:16.35]They do a pog face and they go, wait, no, dude, that's not, I can't use that.
[322:21.22]And I'm sitting here giggling.
[322:26.15]I'm sitting here just laughing my ass off.
[322:55.63]Does this go down or up?
[322:56.53]Because if it goes up, then there's an opportunity to go down there, which I think... Wait, is that just... Oh, this just goes down.
[323:05.39]Okay.
[323:06.09]Wait, look for secrets!
[323:08.85]Got one.
[323:11.67]Where the fuck is it?
[323:23.50]Where is it?
[323:27.27]What side is it on?
[323:27.87]This side?
[323:34.47]On that side.
[323:47.66]What are these statues for?
[323:48.68]This guy has zero object permanence.
[323:54.92]But I'm real fun at parties.
[324:17.16]My weapon is bouncing off of these guys.
[324:18.66]Are these guys made out of this material?
[324:20.47]That's kind of cool.
[324:26.79]Glintstone scrap.
[324:30.55]Oh.
[324:30.63]I thought it was a glintstone key.
[324:48.66]Another... Interesting.
[324:51.45]Another tunnel to go through.
[324:53.01]Another elevator.
[324:53.87]Alright, I'm actually starting to get confused because this is like the third elevator.
[325:04.48]Uh...
[325:12.61]I think I may have missed something.
[325:23.87]Oh my god!
[325:35.44]That was just streamer syndrome.
[325:40.72]I didn't want to have to go back down, because I was going to look over and people were going to be like, dude, this guy's got zero object permanence.
[325:46.50]Like, this guy sucks.
[325:47.52]Like, really, dude?
[325:48.24]You have to go up and down the elevator three times to know where to go?
[325:50.78]And I was like, oh, shit.
[325:52.40]Like, people are going to think I'm stupid, so I have to... I don't even know where that is.
[325:59.04]Um... Where the fuck do I go?
[326:12.75]Marika, you fool.
[326:13.61]What even is Marika?
[326:14.95]What is it?
[326:15.69]Marika is the statue?
[326:19.87]What?
[326:23.62]Marika is the statue?
[326:25.02]I don't remember how to get there.
[326:34.80]It was like I jumped through here.
[326:36.29]I went down.
[326:36.91]I went down twice, I think, right?
[326:39.37]Okay.
[326:42.27]Wait, it's not there.
[326:43.01]I went down here.
[326:47.57]And then it's down.
[326:48.91]I jumped in the middle, went down again.
[326:50.37]No, I'm not.
[326:52.73]This is wrong.
[326:53.55]Where the hell am I?
[326:54.17]Okay.
[327:11.82]There's the elevator you just used.
[327:18.58]But I have to jump in the middle.
[327:20.86]Let me see what's down here, though.
[327:21.78]I'm not going to die.
[327:30.17]Okay.
[327:31.41]Large glintstone scrap.
[327:33.51]What is this for?
[327:34.11]Okay.
[327:47.54]Ooh.
[327:48.62]Wait.
[327:48.84]There could be a hole right here.
[327:51.17]You know what I'm saying?
[327:57.07]Somebody's gonna attack me.
[327:58.55]Right?
[327:58.75]They would've done something like that.
[328:00.39]Okay, so that was worth coming down here.
[328:05.97]A few things.
[328:08.82]Did you kill the horse guy?
[328:10.02]Yeah.
[328:13.20]You can charge up the greatsword?
[328:14.46]Can I?
[328:24.81]Okay.
[328:25.13]I'm a little more interested in this weapon now.
[328:34.19]The only problem is, good luck doing that at any boss encounter in any game ever.
[328:38.31]Alright, zero object permanence, uh, Andrew.
[328:42.44]I believe it's on this side.
[328:56.35]I wanna see the range.
[328:59.07]Critical miss.
[329:23.27]I just want to see what the item does.
[329:40.31]Okay.
[329:40.69]Finally, finally, finally, finally.
[329:43.73]Let me get this.
[329:44.53]Let me jump over here.
[329:47.82]It's this ledge right there.
[329:50.12]I'm ready.
[329:50.64]Here we go.
[329:53.56]Zero awareness.
[329:59.47]This is not the right ledge.
[330:03.21]It's that.
[330:04.29]It's that one.
[330:05.43]Okay.
[330:05.89]It's that one.
[330:06.79]Great.
[330:08.23]Am I dead if I jump off this?
[330:22.62]Golden rune and then the whatever that is.
[330:25.39]I want it.
[330:30.23]Somber smithing stone.
[330:34.77]Excellent.
[330:37.44]OK.
[330:39.38]Well.
[330:42.04]Are we ready?
[330:52.65]If you're low on smithing stones, I recommend going to this stage of the map right here.
[330:56.90]Right here, the Limgrave Tunnels.
[330:59.74]There's plenty of materials for you to gather to be able to upgrade at least two or three times.
[331:11.60]There's a guy in there.
[331:21.62]This guy's fucked.
[331:22.76]Are you ready for this?
[331:26.28]I'm gonna aggro this guy.
[331:28.22]And then I'm gonna run back here and go up the elevator.
[331:30.28]And he's gonna drop down and die.
[331:33.00]I'm getting ready.
[331:36.08]I'm preparing.
[331:36.64]To escape.
[331:57.28]Oh, I can't!
[332:03.35]Fuck!
[332:03.83]I can't!
[332:04.07]I can't!
[332:04.43]Oh, it's...
[332:21.15]I have no mana left.
[332:22.17]What an idiot.
[332:23.41]What a fucking idiotic thing to do.
[332:48.86]What is that?
[332:57.81]It's so hard to tell what he's doing.
[333:02.25]One more time!
[333:02.89]Okay, easy.
[333:05.59]Game is not even a HOT game!
[333:10.16]Rare Medallion.
[333:10.90]Roar Medallion.
[333:24.26]That was cool.
[333:25.06]What a cool little dungeon.
[333:28.92]Any more of the smithing stones?
[333:33.07]I'm just- I really am.
[333:34.27]I need to, like, settle down.
[333:35.47]I'm burn- Okay.
[333:37.29]I'm burning... Like, 30% extra energy by, like, being loud and weird.
[333:44.47]I need to, like- I gotta settle down.
[333:47.27]I'm being too, like, loud.
[333:49.35]I'm burning extra energy.
[333:50.67]Okay, there's nothing else here.
[333:56.84]Was that a... Is that a war thing?
[334:11.86]One of those war things?
[334:17.38]Not.
[334:18.50]What is it?
[334:23.96]Roars and breath attacks?
[334:26.26]Oh, man.
[334:33.31]Man.
[334:39.67]I feel like I'm burning calories just watching you.
[334:43.07]Well, you are.
[334:45.70]It's like for an hour, but you are.
[334:50.07]That was really cool.
[334:50.73]Alright.
[334:51.75]I love the little random dungeons, man.
[334:53.57]That's the best part of the whole game.
[334:55.45]I know the bosses in these Souls games from software games are the best part.
[335:00.36]Everyone's like, oh, I love the bosses.
[335:01.72]Uh-uh, not on this one.
[335:04.10]I think the main story bosses are like all the way down to the bottom.
[335:08.78]Versus like exploring the open world and finding a cool little dungeon.
[335:15.53]That is way, way cooler to me now.
[335:21.60]The huge main story campaign bosses so far have been alright.
[335:24.96]They've been cool.
[335:26.88]But having little dungeons like that that take like 30-40 minutes and there's like a little mini boss at the end.
[335:34.51]I find that way more interesting to me right now. ...
[335:45.22]Like going and exploring the... Okay, for instance, coming to the lake, right?
[335:54.58]And it's like, oh shit, I'm at the lake.
[335:59.63]Oh, here's a guy here, right?
[336:02.27]It's cool.
[336:03.69]There's a dungeon.
[336:04.43]Go find the thing at the end.
[336:17.09]There's a few more places I want to see, but I really probably should get out of here.
[336:20.56]And go explore something else.
[336:24.94]Collect these, though.
[336:29.34]Wait.
[336:30.13]Butterflies?
[336:33.77]Or those bats.
[336:34.61]These bats.
[336:34.95]Okay.
[336:47.16]You probably like Breath of the Wild.
[336:55.10]Probably.
[336:55.51]So we did this.
[337:01.69]Wait, dragon burnt ruins.
[337:03.19]No, he didn't.
[337:03.85]I did this.
[337:04.37]Wait, that's where the dragon came from.
[337:06.21]Hold on a sec.
[337:16.57]New area?
[337:17.19]A little dungeon or something?
[337:22.19]I can burn ruins.
[337:32.71]Bye.
[337:43.46]Nobody move.
[337:44.04]Nobody move.
[337:44.62]Nobody move.
[337:45.26]Nobody move.
[338:03.76]There's safety at the door.
[338:04.64]There's safety at the door.
[338:05.50]There's safety at the door.
[338:06.32]There always is.
[338:06.92]There's I-frames the whole time you open a door.
[338:28.77]Okay, should I do the Stake of Marika?
[338:30.39]Because it's right there?
[338:31.13]Is that the statue that I hit in the head?
[338:37.23]I feel so bad for Jeremy, he looks trapped.
[338:43.56]I'm trapped?
[338:47.20]Like I can't leave?
[338:49.50]Alright, so let me get this straight.
[338:51.42]Stake of Marika.
[338:55.05]So you can have a choice sometimes to spawn.
[338:57.91]But how, what's the criteria for spawning here?
[339:00.28]Do I have to have seen it?
[339:02.56]Just like walk by it?
[339:03.44]Because I don't activate it.
[339:04.30]Does this have to be my line of sight?
[339:06.56]Alright, we're going to have to get the boys involved in this one here.
[339:13.38]We do have to see it, okay.
[339:21.01]Ding dong!
[339:23.41]Sorry to crash the party.
[339:26.62]Me and the boys just figured we'd come and see what you guys got here.
[339:33.94]Ooh, jewels, trinkets.
[339:55.23]Help.
[339:55.69]Help me.
[339:56.05]That's like a terrier.
[340:00.19]What's this like?
[340:02.19]Don't die!
[340:04.53]Why is there a terrier in this game?
[340:06.43]That's just like a fucking Scottish terrier.
[340:35.61]Get him a big wave!
[340:39.83]I think we clean it up.
[340:49.58]Good job, boys.
[341:04.71]Okay.
[341:04.91]I'm here.
[341:06.71]I'm going to go back down here.
[341:08.33]I'm going to drink a potion.
[341:10.22]And I'm going to get rid of these.
[341:13.06]Watch this.
[341:14.22]I'm going to just bowling ball them.
[341:16.58]Check it out.
[341:17.00]Ready?
[341:17.20]I'm going to scoop them all up.
[341:22.73]And run back.
[341:24.51]Why did they not aggro this thing?
[341:28.24]You guys just get in there and just help me.
[341:31.24]By the way, Master Looter is on.
[341:32.52]I get what I'm saying.
[341:34.04]If we have enough DKP, maybe we'll figure it out.
[341:35.86]But do all the work.
[341:43.43]Got hit by the encounter.
[341:45.47]Not good.
[341:46.17]Okay.
[341:47.21]Okay, Mike.
[341:48.29]Mike!
[341:50.21]Okay.
[341:53.30]Nice.
[341:53.58]It was alright.
[341:54.32]But...
[341:57.66]Can't come from the fucking guild.
[342:00.80]Like, that, you know, honestly, this was... Honestly, guys, we can come clean.
[342:04.88]This whole thing was a fucking test for you.
[342:06.86]To see if you could handle it.
[342:08.76]And, apparently, you can't handle it.
[342:11.58]I'm really sorry, dude.
[342:12.50]Maybe you'll find a better guild somewhere.
[342:13.72]But, like, this whole thing was to see if you could kill a fucking dragon.
[342:17.36]And you can't.
[342:18.58]Rune arc?
[342:24.36]Oh my god, I can't wait to open up the treasure.
[342:36.70]What?
[342:37.94]What happened?
[342:39.58]I just got, like, gassed.
[342:52.97]Is it really a crystal tunnel?
[342:54.73]Where are the boys?
[342:59.55]Oh, a chest.
[343:03.31]Gravity stone fan?
[343:04.65]Gravity stone chunk.
[343:12.36]Oh wow, this is cool.
[343:24.99]Oh boy.
[343:25.81]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[343:27.37]Don't go in there.
[343:30.15]Don't go over there either.
[343:31.01]These guys are made of the same chunky bullshit.
[343:38.52]What the fuck was that?
[343:40.56]What's happening to me?
[343:48.41]What the hell was that?
[343:51.83]You gotta change guild.
[343:52.71]The boys are not cutting it anymore.
[343:54.17]This place is horrible, by the way.
[343:55.81]Those are shrimps.
[343:56.59]They really are like giant shrimps.
[344:00.51]Where's my respawn here?
[344:02.29]Is it just back at the statue?
[344:04.33]Am I stuck here?
[344:09.83]Holy shit.
[344:10.59]I'm all the way over here.
[344:11.43]This is weird.
[344:12.20]Alright.
[344:12.44]Alright, alright, alright.
[344:14.02]Don't fuck around.
[344:23.65]We're playing this super safe.
[344:25.21]I'm not messing around.
[344:26.09]There's a weird huge skeleton bug shrimp people.
[344:36.12]Where is he?
[344:36.46]Is he next to me?
[344:38.14]Oh, he's up there.
[344:41.36]Sorry.
[344:43.95]Can I backstab?
[344:50.21]Let me try to backstab.
[344:58.80]Dude, you got these spikes that just fall out of you.
[345:23.38]And there's a, excuse me, where did you come from?
[345:25.28]There's a, well, who threw that one?
[345:26.56]Are you behind me?
[345:27.80]It's, where are they going?
[345:32.34]I don't want the stupid claw.
[345:34.49]We're going for it.
[345:46.72]By the power of the great sword.
[345:50.96]This thing sucks.
[345:52.68]I'm literally uninstalling that.
[345:54.14]I'm literally uninstalling that.
[345:56.17]I'm unequipping that right now.
[346:05.12]I dodged it accidentally.
[346:35.14]Don't forget these, you jackass!
[347:01.55]Okay.
[347:02.94]Okay.
[347:11.06]I have nothing.
[347:12.00]I'm in trouble here.
[347:16.30]There's so much shit down here.
[347:17.22]There's so many materials.
[347:18.14]What if I just avoid the big bug guy?
[347:19.56]I don't...
[347:33.99]Get shit on.
[347:52.05]It's so much goddamn noise.
[347:57.57]Hide, hide, hide, hide quick.
[348:13.46]Where's that other bug?
[348:15.22]Up there, right?
[348:16.88]Look at all these things that are here.
[348:18.04]Oh my god, look at all these materials.
[348:25.49]I think he saw me.
[348:49.60]All right, let's go.
[348:52.64]Anything else down here?
[348:53.38]Are there any salads in this game?
[348:59.02]Why did I read that?
[348:59.70]Slowly.
[349:10.65]Slowly.
[349:13.37]When I slow, I mean, you know what I mean?
[349:15.43]That joke, I mean fucking slow.
[349:22.03]There's an animal down here.
[349:23.44]I just heard it.
[349:23.98]I'm gonna climb down this ass bait.
[349:44.96]The game is waiting for me to go down to a certain place to have the guy run at me.
[350:10.82]Okay, I'm good.
[350:15.03]Jesus.
[350:16.90]Of course I'm going to be paranoid.
[350:17.82]Are you serious?
[350:31.51]Rock grease?
[350:34.79]It's not a little dungeon?
[350:38.71]What's down here?
[350:45.37]Coral?
[351:00.18]What is that?
[351:03.98]I think alive?
[351:08.22]What is that?
[351:09.02]Is that a big turtle?
[351:11.96]Oh, I thought it was a big turtle going like this.
[351:19.19]I mean, the thing has to die.
[351:23.51]Well, that's a boss area, if I've ever seen one.
[351:29.34]I don't know what that is, but I don't want to be near it.
[351:38.43]Alright, settle down.
[351:44.75]Settle down!
[351:45.41]What the fuck?
[351:49.65]Like, general Grievous enemies.
[351:53.00]Alright, fine.
[351:53.64]I'm just gonna... That's very upsetting to me.
[352:27.14]I can do I can swing three or four times with the crust And not even have to worry about this, but you know what let's just go ahead and do this because who cares at this point
[352:45.64]What is this guy worth?
[352:46.26]Hope he drops something.
[352:51.87]500 souls and... Strip of white flesh.
[353:02.15]Well, now I'm gonna... Okay, they're just everywhere.
[353:04.52]What's the point?
[353:05.86]I'm gonna go back and I... Because this is boss, right?
[353:08.28]This has to be boss.
[353:11.66]And they listened.
[353:15.68]You notice that this is a big open area, just final destination.
[353:19.07]It's not like a hundred gravestones.
[353:23.37]Nice and flat.
[353:25.69]Let me just see what I can do here, because I don't want to lose any souls.
[353:29.01]I already lost seven goddamn thousand.
[353:31.81]Like a dingus.
[353:34.95]I got a lot.
[353:35.39]Okay, I can break these.
[353:37.69]I think I will do it.
[353:38.43]Yeah.
[353:38.87]There's also a couple of spells I can still buy too, right?
[353:45.30]Which I will.
[353:51.29]Did you get to Godric?
[353:52.27]I beat Godric, and I was very, very unhappy for a majority of that hour or plus that it took me to do it.
[353:56.85]Alright.
[353:57.93]Let's go back to... I can just port here, so that's fine.
[354:12.14]Let's go...
[354:14.57]Here.
[354:15.49]Wait, what?
[354:15.79]What do you mean?
[354:25.80]Can't leave?
[354:36.64]Go out here.
[354:37.26]I can't TP indoors.
[354:38.96]Oh, okay.
[354:40.42]I was about to be very scared.
[354:41.68]Alright, there we go.
[354:42.66]So, I'm going to go buy the other spells.
[354:50.33]There's this one that he has that I know I wanted.
[354:52.27]There was a defensive one and then there was a regular attack one.
[354:55.89]Forget it.
[355:00.33]Fun to see you play a game that you actually enjoy instead of fart simulator.
[355:06.52]It's time to chap stick it up.
[355:08.22]Just for a minute.
[355:11.44]My hands are so sweaty that I couldn't even open this.
[355:26.09]Okay.
[355:27.13]What do you have that I want?
[355:32.67]I want... Okay.
[355:33.89]Glintstone Pebble.
[355:35.21]It's an Ash of War.
[355:36.43]These are all Ashes of War.
[355:38.89]What about that guy?
[355:41.81]Didn't that guy have other stuff?
[355:43.97]The other sorcery guy?
[355:45.09]Dude that's up here.
[355:48.03]This guy, right?
[355:55.53]Where was that other guy?
[355:56.45]There was a guy sitting down.
[355:57.65]At a ledge.
[356:00.19]I think it was here.
[356:00.73]He was sitting at like the ruins.
[356:06.39]Where were they?
[356:06.88]No, it was here.
[356:07.34]It was here, right?
[356:08.12]I think it was up here.
[356:10.66]Yeah.
[356:13.20]He had a couple other moves that I wanted.
[356:19.62]It's the church.
[356:20.07]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[356:20.53]Yep.
[356:29.69]How come this guy doesn't go back to town?
[356:30.79]Hold on.
[356:33.77]I need to, like, remember to blink.
[356:37.17]Okay, bud.
[356:44.39]This one here.
[356:50.15]Starlight.
[356:50.93]Okay.
[356:52.83]Let's get it.
[356:53.51]Just to have it.
[356:55.99]So, what am I supposed to do with the scroll that I have?
[357:00.63]This thing, what do I do with it?
[357:02.87]Who am I supposed to give it to?
[357:07.55]Academy scroll.
[357:08.31]Give to a learned sorcerer to acquire new sorceries.
[357:11.24]What do I do with it?
[357:13.44]Great glintstone shard.
[357:14.50]Swift glintstone shard.
[357:17.80]Do I have to get access to the academy?
[357:28.57]Well, at least I got that.
[357:31.47]I'm actually not even going to use it, but I'm going to have it just for when I need it.
[357:36.22]Now... I hate having souls like this, though.
[357:45.31]I have a lot of shards.
[357:46.27]Maybe it's time to upgrade something.
[357:47.45]You know what I'm saying?
[357:53.01]Did you talk to the finger lady?
[357:55.35]I did.
[358:02.95]I wonder if I can upgrade... This sword is pretty good, though.
[358:05.53]I like it.
[358:07.37]Did talk a lot of shit about thrust weapons, but... It's already upgraded, so I can't complain about it.
[358:24.36]The dragon stuff, that's right.
[358:25.88]Okay.
[358:32.40]Asher's War.
[358:34.94]Lintblade Phalanx.
[358:37.66]That's the one that I had before.
[358:39.14]Determination's the new one, right?
[358:41.34]What does this do?
[358:45.69]I get a description of what it does?
[358:52.71]Knightly skill.
[358:53.35]Hold the flat of the arm into your face and pledge your resolve, powering up your next attack.
[359:00.79]I don't think so.
[359:01.55]I think I'm actually going to put this on because this thing kind of sucks.
[359:08.60]And I can at least move around with that on.
[359:10.36]Spirit Tuning?
[359:14.74]Like a Spirit Tune?
[359:30.99]Okay.
[359:32.27]Uh, this, I need six smithing stones.
[359:35.77]Three.
[359:38.73]I mean, I could just, this is probably what I'm going to do.
[359:42.78]Will I find another goddamn staff?
[359:54.15]One more time.
[360:01.70]I don't want to use the bigger smithing stones.
[360:06.13]Not a good thing.
[360:11.37]Claws are cool.
[360:12.09]They are, but this thing has actually been working pretty well.
[360:18.44]The claws were great for bleed.
[360:19.76]If I need to use them, I will.
[360:20.76]Alright, let me go talk to that person.
[360:27.65]Where were they?
[360:29.09]I don't want to hug.
[360:36.60]Who is it?
[360:36.88]You?
[360:36.98]No, it's... Whoa.
[360:37.35]Tell her what the blacksmith said.
[360:38.49]Okay.
[360:53.01]I don't believe you.
[360:54.53]If I do have this talent, I suppose I should try to hone it, shouldn't I?
[360:58.94]What is it?
[360:59.44]I'll ask Master Hugh to teach me.
[361:01.56]Certainly he does appear intimidating and holds no love for us.
[361:06.08]I know he's trapped here at the round table hold.
[361:08.84]Just like Gemma.
[361:10.06]He's trapped here.
[361:10.74]He can't leave.
[361:13.70]So?
[361:14.68]If I do have a talent for spirit tuning, and goodness knows that would... I suppose I should try to hone it.
[361:21.19]I'll ask Master...
[361:22.48]Okay, we'll do it.
[361:27.51]Hurry up.
[361:29.17]I got stuff to hone.
[361:30.87]Alright, well that's cool.
[361:41.07]I'm gonna buy some stuff.
[361:46.84]What can I do?
[361:55.85]Now, 2400 souls is enough for me to not want to fight this boss.
[361:58.73]Because I'm just going to lose those souls.
[362:00.35]I'm never going to get them back.
[362:01.71]So I need to buy something.
[362:04.18]Where's the lady?
[362:07.50]It's like the old lady, right?
[362:09.22]There's a vendor over here somewhere.
[362:10.42]Down here.
[362:11.44]Yeah, okay.
[362:17.17]Finger seal?
[362:21.11]Finger seal?
[362:27.11]What is that?
[362:34.80]Rune Arc.
[362:36.98]That's what I picked up.
[362:43.26]What?
[362:51.17]So this is a permanent HP increase if I use it?
[362:58.56]I don't get it.
[363:06.81]I have a stone key that I can use.
[363:08.45]Yeah, but I think I need two.
[363:12.09]Rune arcs are like humanities, but they're more rare.
[363:14.44]Just buy the rings.
[363:21.10]I guess I could just buy the rings.
[363:23.04]Just to make sure I have them.
[363:27.21]It's either that or another shield.
[363:32.82]Is this any different?
[363:33.78]Heater shield.
[363:38.10]It's for multiplayer, yeah.
[363:45.67]Rings or shield?
[363:47.67]More spell spaces?
[363:55.51]Petal shields negate physical damage when guarding.
[363:58.37]I guess it's not a terrible thing to have.
[364:00.39]I get it.
[364:06.13]Okay.
[364:10.61]This is a parry shield.
[364:11.91]Yeah, I mean, this is just better.
[364:14.37]A bunch more physical.
[364:18.72]I could guard.
[364:20.12]Start guarding.
[364:25.09]The only issue is I can't cast with that.
[364:28.59]But, it's okay.
[364:31.13]Get all these off.
[364:31.69]I'm not using them.
[364:39.65]Okay.
[364:41.37]Okay, let's go try it.
[364:43.03]Let's go get our ass kicked.
[364:48.27]Might as well.
[364:58.77]All the dragon stuff, that's right.
[365:00.13]I'll look at it.
[365:02.49]What would that be under?
[365:06.74]Is it an item?
[365:16.73]Lures and invaders?
[365:18.49]That's one of the other things that I got.
[365:28.05]Who would it be?
[365:28.59]Is it a dragon thingy?
[365:33.51]Dragonheart.
[365:34.05]Gain power of the dragon at the dragon communion altar.
[365:41.06]Okay, dragon communion altar.
[365:42.58]Well, I gotta find that.
[365:48.70]Well, let's just walk out here.
[365:49.56]Here we go.
[365:50.68]It's time.
[365:53.28]I've got my stuff equipped.
[365:54.94]Ready.
[365:55.12]Ready.
[365:57.23]Alright, what do you got?
[365:58.57]Let's see it.
[365:58.99]I can use the horse.
[366:14.68]Swamp of Ionia.
[366:29.04]Another rune arc.
[366:34.08]Interesting.
[366:41.19]Run away.
[366:50.87]Shit, settle down.
[366:59.68]Cuckoo?
[367:00.59]Cuckoo?
[367:01.37]Cuckoo Glintstone?
[367:10.69]Ooh.
[367:11.45]Marionette Soldier Armor.
[367:17.70]Resistance to focus problems.
[367:20.20]Holy damage reduction.
[367:21.46]Magic damage reduction.
[367:22.46]Put it on.
[367:27.32]I don't like it.
[367:30.61]Bro, thrust is OP.
[367:36.98]Alright, so what do we got?
[367:37.84]What's here?
[367:38.36]A lot of nothing?
[367:41.04]There's nothing up here though.
[367:42.14]What's that?
[367:42.50]I don't know.
[367:45.46]Mock it.
[367:56.51]Up by the shack beyond the southern gate.
[368:13.75]Stop by the shack beyond the southern gate.
[368:16.71]I must be able to go this way.
[368:23.66]What else is over here though?
[368:34.98]I'm just checking each little nook and cranny.
[368:37.77]Whoa.
[368:41.59]Got a new dog?
[368:52.27]That's got a lot of health.
[368:53.13]Okay.
[369:06.74]Will you die?
[369:07.30]Just stab him in the face already.
[369:14.19]I didn't even- Oh, this fucking thing.
[369:16.03]Alright, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[369:17.77]Beast blood.
[369:21.03]What's up there?
[369:21.91]Well, okay, this is getting weird.
[369:32.08]Holy shit!
[369:40.05]I'm out of mana.
[369:43.29]Jesus, man.
[369:44.29]These guys are crazy.
[369:48.77]Okay.
[369:54.01]I can go up here, or I can go this way.
[369:56.39]Let's see.
[369:58.17]It's the Bloodborne realm.
[369:59.31]It actually looks pretty cool.
[370:00.07]Okay.
[370:07.65]Do we go Glintstone?
[370:19.59]Check over here.
[370:21.82]That's a big boy.
[370:26.02]He's huge.
[370:27.32]He's massive.
[370:30.84]What am I doing?
[370:31.52]Put a weapon on!
[370:33.18]Put a fucking weapon on!
[370:46.92]Is that him right there?
[370:52.01]Oh, shit.
[370:52.83]I gotta respawn him.
[370:59.95]And just start stabbing him.
[371:17.49]Hope I have enough damage to kill it.
[371:24.53]Where is he?
[371:28.13]There he is.
[371:30.36]Okay, let's go.
[371:31.58]Here we go.
[371:33.36]And... What'd you get?
[371:52.88]There's nothing in that?
[371:56.72]That's kind of bullshit.
[372:00.34]Bullshit.
[372:02.70]Well.
[372:11.86]God, more bugs.
[372:31.29]You have to explode.
[372:32.44]You have to explode!
[372:38.84]New spell though, let's check it out.
[372:45.19]I think that's a holy spell.
[372:46.41]I don't think that's a, uh... That is a holy spell.
[372:58.54]Sacred Ring of Light.
[373:02.51]Used by the commanders of the clean rot knights.
[373:05.01]Gather a sacred ring of light in the armament.
[373:07.55]Fire it forwards.
[373:08.59]Can be fired in rapid succession.
[373:10.72]Useable on pole arms.
[373:13.88]I think this is holy.
[373:14.58]I don't think that's for me.
[373:21.06]Let's go get our souls back.
[373:22.26]Okay.
[373:29.46]Summon your new squad.
[373:30.30]I will in a minute.
[373:32.74]You know, I need something like... This armrest sucks.
[373:36.01]I need my armrest to be made out of, like, putty or something.
[373:39.17]Like clay.
[373:49.80]Alright, what's down here?
[373:50.52]Can't open the map.
[373:56.63]I gotta get out of here.
[373:57.91]Get away.
[373:58.23]Get away.
[373:58.47]Get away.
[373:58.67]Get away.
[373:58.89]Get away.
[373:59.15]Get away.
[374:09.82]What's that flag?
[374:11.22]Okay.
[374:11.86]Oop.
[374:12.22]Spitting stone.
[374:12.86]Anion... Whatever that was.
[374:17.38]Something beauty?
[374:22.54]Hello?
[374:22.80]Okay.
[374:23.20]Who the fuck are you?
[374:30.37]Wow.
[374:38.02]You gonna play this game?
[374:38.88]Fine.
[374:39.26]I'll get off the horse.
[374:44.27]You wanna play this game?
[374:45.29]Fine.
[374:58.41]Scarlet what?
[374:59.33]What is that?
[375:00.73]Poison or something?
[375:17.86]That hurts.
[375:19.92]Oh, alright.
[375:22.68]Am I supposed to be here?
[375:24.20]I think these guys are hard.
[375:25.20]I think these guys are hard.
[375:28.77]I think this is like a hard area.
[375:35.83]You're underleveled for here?
[375:37.77]Yeah, I kind of want to... Okay, let me get my souls and I'm going to run this way.
[375:47.28]Of course there's a swamp, right?
[375:50.02]Water's poisonous.
[375:51.76]I think it was him attacking me that was hurting me, right?
[375:54.78]Giving me poison.
[376:04.13]Yeah, there's definitely stuff back in Limgrave that I haven't seen.
[376:08.87]Give me a second.
[376:09.51]I might be able to find something cool here.
[376:10.70]Let's fuck all the bullshit, right?
[376:15.50]Let me just take a look.
[376:30.05]Killed my horse.
[376:36.45]Okay, what is over here?
[376:38.45]Tons of items here.
[376:39.45]Something's going to come out of the ground.
[376:40.55]Alright, this is two purple items.
[376:45.30]I do like this area, though.
[376:58.83]This is not like the typical swamps that they put in their games.
[377:00.85]This is actually kind of... This is actually cool.
[377:05.35]It's more spores than it is swamp.
[377:08.53]Which... That's alright.
[377:10.11]That's kind of cool.
[377:18.27]The real question is, what's here?
[377:19.35]There's a point of interest right here.
[377:26.77]It's a trader.
[377:35.22]Lion?
[377:39.94]Crack the pot.
[377:46.13]Key.
[377:48.67]Champion pauldron?
[377:49.79]Flaming Bolt or Gravity's Advantage.
[377:55.46]Okay.
[377:58.66]Maybe should I buy a pot?
[378:03.44]Crackpot?
[378:05.12]Do I have one?
[378:09.48]I wonder if there's a crocodile.
[378:11.02]There could be.
[378:18.22]I guess I'm just going to buy a pot.
[378:19.14]I already have one.
[378:21.38]Oh.
[378:22.94]Oops.
[378:28.20]Can I sell you that back?
[378:33.59]Wasted.
[378:34.73]Activate the campfire.
[378:37.43]Well, that's just a random vendor.
[378:39.95]Alright.
[378:43.45]I think I'll go back to Limgrave here.
[378:45.03]I think I'm way out of my league.
[378:48.12]I'm going to go turn around.
[378:49.97]I'm going to go over here.
[378:50.71]I feel like there's something cool right here.
[378:51.95]I'm going this way for a minute.
[379:10.81]Keep your eyes out.
[379:19.06]Hey, don't look at me!
[379:38.91]Holy shit!
[379:59.15]It's in parry.
[380:01.09]Excuse me.
[380:02.27]What's up with that?
[380:04.89]Bleh!
[380:28.25]I kind of just panicked there.
[380:33.04]I don't know why.
[380:33.68]Kind of for no reason.
[380:35.44]I was just panicking.
[380:37.08]It was kind of bizarre.
[380:40.76]I just was just freaking out.
[380:41.80]Because I thought I dodged the first one.
[380:42.96]Or the second one.
[380:43.78]But I didn't know why I needed to dodge two more times.
[380:45.86]That was stupid.
[380:50.01]Cathedral of Dragon.
[380:51.39]This is it.
[380:55.69]I actually found it.
[380:58.67]I have the, so I can do the dragon spell.
[381:02.41]Does the dragon spell, is it intelligence based?
[381:04.68]Because that would be pretty huge if it was.
[381:07.68]Ancient dragon cookbook.
[381:15.36]Well, I'm glad I'm getting these for later.
[381:21.66]So all these places I can travel to, that's going to help out when I know I need to go here.
[381:29.44]Where's all this cool shit for sorcery?
[381:49.18]Flames, dragon breath, scarlet rot breath.
[381:57.28]Is Faith where it's at?
[381:58.56]Did I pick like the... There's got to be some more cool sorcery stuff, right?
[382:06.74]It tells me to go that way.
[382:09.37]You know what?
[382:16.51]Let's go see what it is.
[382:22.07]It's like the edge of the earth.
[382:27.24]It wants me to go over here.
[382:28.39]I'm very curious what this is.
[382:29.47]This is probably high-level bullshit, but whatever.
[382:33.01]I'm going for it.
[382:34.11]I just want to see what it is.
[382:48.18]What?
[382:48.36]What the fuck?
[382:52.51]I tried to double jump to time it.
[382:57.04]I tried to do that correctly.
[382:58.42]I guess that was still too high.
[382:59.93]That dog is huge.
[383:03.87]Do you think I can kill the dog on the horseback?
[383:07.03]This is cool.
[383:07.79]This game is so cool.
[383:09.17]This open world Dark Souls is so cool.
[383:14.05]Alright, let's try that again.
[383:15.71]These dogs are huge.
[383:22.29]I didn't even hit the ground yet.
[383:25.13]Why did I hit the ground preemptively?
[383:26.98]I was like 5, 10 feet off the ground.
[383:31.68]I hit the ground preemptively.
[383:56.58]Something's not right here.
[383:57.32]Something's not right here.
[384:03.12]It doesn't work?
[384:08.12]Wait, I can't do, like, the scout from Team Fortress?
[384:10.86]Why not?
[384:20.02]Well, I guess I'm just gonna go the regular way then.
[384:22.92]Then.
[384:24.94]It's not Yoshi.
[384:27.03]Yeah, but wouldn't that make sense that you'd be able to do that?
[384:29.31]Alright, it's down here.
[384:42.04]Right over here.
[384:46.04]Look at that weirdo!
[384:48.96]What a weirdo!
[384:52.09]That's a weirdo, okay?
[384:54.43]That's a human with a gigantic bird head.
[385:03.51]Better range.
[385:16.43]That's not hurting him really at all.
[385:18.13]Holy shit.
[385:24.81]It can hurt these guys.
[385:36.15]I don't even want to be here.
[385:37.51]I'm not supposed to be here.
[385:39.39]I'm just checking it out because it's pointing this direction.
[385:42.15]I'm exploring the world.
[385:44.41]This is crazy.
[386:00.40]Look at how cool this is.
[386:03.09]This is how dinosaurs really looked.
[386:10.44]What the?
[386:10.96]What is that?
[386:14.31]Wait, what?
[386:17.29]Are these dogs on my... Whose team are they on?
[386:19.61]Are they on different teams?
[386:22.07]Holy shit.
[386:23.59]Oh, just kill each other.
[386:24.77]Just kill each other.
[386:27.75]And by the way, why don't we get the boys involved?
[386:39.49]Yes.
[386:40.51]Yes.
[386:40.83]Hey, hey, hey.
[386:47.69]Hey, you're out of bounds.
[386:48.86]Hey, buddy, you're out of bounds.
[386:57.46]Get him.
[387:02.85]Wait, they're killing each other.
[387:05.33]This is just like a...
[387:09.21]Hold on, I'm going to get my staff out.
[387:11.13]Alright, I'm going to go for the... What do I go for?
[387:18.33]I'm going to wait until all the guys have been killed.
[387:20.43]And then I'm just going to walk around and pick up all the items, alright?
[387:27.94]They're about to kill the dog.
[387:29.56]Let's thin him out a little bit.
[387:31.00]This guy right here.
[387:31.72]Sorry, you were picked to be the first person to die.
[387:34.30]Okay.
[387:37.22]Just making it interesting.
[387:40.99]Dogs.
[387:42.31]Nice.
[387:42.77]That was a parry.
[387:43.63]Alright, you're way too strong, so you have to die next.
[387:48.04]This guy, this knight right here.
[387:54.38]Stay away from me, though.
[387:55.10]Okay, we're going to thin this guy out here.
[387:56.70]That one.
[387:57.02]You're dead.
[388:01.09]You, right there.
[388:06.43]The knights are actually starting to become a problem.
[388:08.17]Kill one of those knights, please.
[388:14.32]Hey, hey, hey, excuse me, out of bounds.
[388:23.22]I'm trying to aim at you, and it keeps changing my target.
[388:26.16]Like, aim at the fucking... Sir, come over here, please.
[388:31.08]Come over here, over here.
[388:31.78]How we doing?
[388:47.82]Look at all these souls I'm just... Alright, the knight has to die.
[388:54.82]How do you miss a guy that can't even see you?
[389:07.81]Hey!
[389:19.94]Oh, he's still alive.
[389:27.50]Item collection time.
[389:28.18]One of the dogs is dead.
[389:29.91]Nope.
[389:32.07]Okay, alright, alright.
[389:32.83]I gotta be ready to kill the dog in one hit.
[389:43.95]Why are you so strong?
[389:44.85]Actually, come over here.
[389:45.53]Come over here.
[389:46.13]I changed my mind.
[389:47.21]Come this way.
[389:50.98]There's still two dogs over here.
[389:53.10]And you guys need to follow me.
[389:54.64]Because you have to fight these things.
[389:55.90]Because I'm not fucking doing it.
[389:57.46]Who cares?
[389:57.92]Follow me.
[390:02.79]Come on.
[390:02.97]Alright.
[390:11.95]Go on.
[390:17.53]Shit.
[390:18.39]No.
[390:18.65]You're supposed to kill him.
[390:28.29]Oh my god!
[390:29.13]I wasn't paying any attention, dude!
[390:42.82]What's going on now?
[390:45.34]Peaceblood.
[390:45.78]Alright.
[390:46.30]I think we're good.
[390:49.36]Huber transformation.
[390:51.14]I got some gloves.
[390:51.82]There's one more enemy here.
[390:59.59]Alright.
[391:01.41]Successful lot of souls.
[391:02.63]That's awesome.
[391:03.37]Alright.
[391:03.79]That was pretty cool.
[391:05.25]That was actually really cool.
[391:06.09]How much health do you have?
[391:08.31]Is it enough for me to spam and kill you?
[391:13.29]Might be.
[391:13.63]Let's go for it.
[391:25.88]Very good.
[391:27.60]So what the hell is even down here?
[391:34.59]A lot of nothing.
[391:35.15]Don't be greedy.
[391:58.38]What else is over here?
[391:59.28]I'm about to leave.
[392:02.40]Oh, hell yeah.
[392:09.31]Perfect.
[392:18.78]Oh, I can upgrade my flask, yeah.
[392:20.54]I'll do that now.
[392:23.36]Do a pee break?
[392:23.98]I will in about five minutes.
[392:30.55]We're doing Dexterity after this.
[392:38.33]Not enough golden seeds.
[392:41.19]Did I already use it?
[392:42.05]I think I already used it, I guess.
[392:44.39]Okay.
[392:46.69]What's in this building?
[392:50.76]I'm just going to examine what's in the building and then we can go from there.
[392:53.04]I think I can probably go up.
[392:54.02]I can.
[392:54.52]Alright, there's something over here.
[392:58.35]Items.
[393:13.03]Okay.
[393:14.77]Well, fine.
[393:21.56]Goodbye.
[393:44.51]Heavy crossbow.
[393:45.19]So what do you got stored up here?
[393:52.94]Three stooges.
[394:02.80]A chest.
[394:03.16]Is there somebody else all the way up?
[394:11.57]That's the question.
[394:17.39]sorry about that okay okay back down back down back down back down back down go on go on go on go on go on go on go on go on go on go on go on go on all right so you just pick your head up and go back down whatever they're all just sleeping up there no one's there's whatever
[394:46.35]I got this.
[394:47.05]I got this.
[395:00.76]Uh-huh.
[395:01.62]Okay.
[395:02.14]Yep.
[395:02.64]Come on.
[395:06.50]Not gonna follow me down?
[395:09.54]Follow me down.
[395:10.12]Get on the ladder.
[395:23.46]What am I doing?
[395:24.06]Go up!
[395:24.80]Why am I doing this?
[395:26.56]What am I doing that for?
[395:29.30]I could have just climbed up and I just lost 2,000 souls.
[395:31.71]I could have just gone up.
[395:34.83]I don't know why my rage took over.
[395:37.41]I had to slide down and hit them and hurt them.
[395:41.59]I could have just climbed up without even a single problem.
[395:44.62]What was I doing?
[395:48.64]Okay, whatever.
[395:51.83]I need to know what's up there.
[395:52.75]There's probably something up there, like a chest or something.
[396:06.30]Put your shield down, coward.
[396:13.30]Put your shield down.
[396:15.28]Put your shields down.
[396:19.09]Put your shields down.
[396:41.25]Stop moving.
[396:42.71]Just stand still.
[396:58.12]I freaked out because I thought my health was at zero.
[397:01.18]It was the exact same color as the sky for a second.
[397:03.98]And I was like, why is my health bar zero?
[397:06.34]And I kind of freaked out.
[397:18.64]Alright, fuck both of you.
[397:31.43]Just cheeses the whole game?
[397:32.61]What are you talking about?
[397:38.26]The last like three or four bosses I've bought without sorcery.
[397:43.22]I'm a battle mage.
[397:44.48]You don't want me to use sorcery?
[397:46.38]Like, I have 22 points of intelligence.
[398:05.37]Okay.
[398:05.87]Come on.
[398:06.27]Get down here.
[398:11.23]Holy shit.
[398:17.14]Is that the only guy?
[398:25.71]That encounter was... Yeah, tell them to stop cheesing me.
[398:28.49]I'm sitting there.
[398:29.05]I can't even climb the ladder.
[398:30.03]Yeah, that guy's asleep over there.
[398:36.37]Here he comes.
[398:46.63]Ready?
[398:53.26]Alright, nice.
[398:59.71]Are you the guy that they call Freddy Fencing because of your Elden Ring fencing gameplay?
[399:04.65]I've been called a few different things, yeah.
[399:05.83]Alright, so what was the point?
[399:19.78]There's another ladder.
[399:23.55]There's actually another ladder right there.
[399:25.39]Come on, something good.
[399:29.87]Something worth coming up here for.
[399:32.55]Arrow Sting Talisman.
[399:34.13]That seems probably like extra damage on range, but let's see what's up here.
[399:46.79]Uh.
[399:50.36]What?
[399:51.46]Is it?
[399:55.08]What is it?
[399:57.46]Yeah, okay.
[399:58.72]Raise his attack power of sorcery spells.
[400:05.03]Still cool coming up here.
[400:11.34]Alright.
[400:13.90]It's time to go back to Loon Grave.
[400:15.92]It's time to take a break.
[400:19.93]And I'm gonna... I want to go this way, I think.
[400:23.75]Either here or here.
[400:27.90]This is like the spawn.
[400:30.60]And I need two... Wait a minute.
[400:32.44]Hold on.
[400:32.76]Wait, wait, wait.
[400:33.24]Is it time to... Can I actually go back and do this?
[400:37.05]How many, um... It's two stones to go in the one at spawn, right?
[400:59.48]So if it's two stones to go back to the... It's 4,000 to buy one.
[401:02.95]I have one.
[401:08.49]I could go, like, here.
[401:11.43]Go, like, down this way, essentially, right?
[401:16.66]Let me try that first, though.
[401:17.78]Let me farm... We'll take a break after this.
[401:21.28]I'm going to farm a fight here.
[401:23.64]Get enough to buy one.
[401:24.80]Go open the one at spawn.
[401:27.16]See what's in there.
[401:30.03]I just need, I need 4,000.
[401:30.55]Good luck, everybody.
[401:36.15]Don't be a dickhead, really.
[401:51.26]You know, I'll just fight.
[401:52.22]I'll just... Okay, I need 4,000.
[401:56.54]Come on, go for it.
[402:03.58]Weirdly enough, the dogs are not doing that much damage to these guys.
[402:07.16]Like, at all.
[402:08.40]They're kind of getting destroyed.
[402:19.31]Harry.
[402:24.87]I'm just waiting for one of you to die.
[402:26.17]I don't care who.
[402:26.91]This is going to be worth like a thousand.
[402:31.16]Gotta get the boys out.
[402:32.38]Alright, sure, why not.
[402:33.60]Let's get the boys out here.
[402:54.08]And then we come in and we claim victory.
[403:04.14]That's such bullshit.
[403:09.13]Like, I'm such a piece of shit for what I'm doing right now.
[403:17.15]Hey, don't blame me, blame the game that lets me get experience points when I don't do anything.
[403:36.63]Work smarter, not harder.
[403:37.79]I got way too complacent.
[403:49.48]Okay, 3d, 3d, 35,000.
[404:06.29]Out of mana, we're almost there.
[404:07.55]Alright, let me just switch to this.
[404:09.71]Get a couple stabs in.
[404:21.82]I am on no one's team.
[404:29.42]Oops.
[404:30.94]I'm such a dude.
[404:37.47]I'm such a dick.
[404:44.51]I have like all the cheat codes.
[404:45.79]I'm not even supposed to be here.
[404:53.77]So bad.
[404:57.61]Okay, let's go.
[404:59.69]I've got enough souls that I can buy it.
[405:01.55]We're gonna see some cool content here.
[405:02.87]You ready?
[405:05.43]Anybody drop anything?
[405:12.51]Who sells this shit?
[405:13.99]This guy does, right?
[405:15.25]Somebody does.
[405:18.91]Who sells them?
[405:21.34]You do, right?
[405:28.94]You're the person in Team Fortress 2 when everybody on both teams is trying to chill and hang out, and you, the one guy that come in and ruin everything.
[405:36.17]Yeah, I just, like, I just... Drop an entire magazine or entire clip of stickies in the room, and then sit there and go... And just watch the kill feed.
[405:48.08]I have, like, five names on it.
[405:50.64]Fucking dick.
[405:56.36]Who's this?
[405:57.71]I don't believe we've met.
[405:59.03]I'm known as D. D?
[406:02.32]I hunt down those who live in death and weed their death root.
[406:07.07]heed my warning those who live in death should be left well alone all the more should you spy a mariner among their number unless you wish to lay down your life in vain huh those who live in death should be left all the more should you spy a mariner whatever that means okay I'm gonna buy one of those things and then we are gonna go from there
[406:38.31]the spawn of the game.
[406:42.14]I'm going to put both keys in and we're going to see what happens.
[406:46.14]I'm actually pretty excited.
[406:48.58]This actually seems pretty cool.
[406:51.74]Very excited.
[406:52.36]Let's do it.
[407:06.11]It's like right here, right?
[407:09.30]First step, right?
[407:12.06]Is it two?
[407:12.60]It's three?
[407:13.70]No, it's not.
[407:14.44]I thought it was two.
[407:18.46]Is it actually three?
[407:19.28]It's three.
[407:26.30]Yeah, I'll get down here.
[407:29.95]I'll get down here and we'll figure it out.
[407:32.61]Where is it?
[407:56.70]Oh, I gotta go pee.
[407:57.54]I know, I know, man.
[407:58.36]I know.
[408:01.63]One moment.
[408:06.66]I'm gonna get the bonfire.
[408:07.66]There it is.
[408:11.75]Okay.
[408:12.03]I'm gonna open it.
[408:15.45]Rest here.
[408:16.03]Open it.
[408:18.13]See what the hell's down here.
[408:21.97]Actually, no.
[408:22.37]This will be when we come back.
[408:23.19]Because I want this thing to be a big reveal.
[408:24.75]Alright.
[408:24.99]Let's go pee.
[408:25.35]I'll be right back.
[408:31.03]How long have I been streaming for?
[408:32.61]Because I'm streaming tomorrow, too.
[408:35.11]How long has it been?
[408:36.69]Six hours?
[408:37.13]Alright, we're gonna go for like another hour or two.
[408:39.97]And then I'll be live again tomorrow.
[408:41.95]With more Elden Ring.
[408:45.14]Make sure you loop the music.
[408:46.72]I will.
[408:51.78]We'll play a different one.
[408:53.24]One you guys have recognized.
[408:54.28]I'll be right back.
[408:57.08]Go on, P.
[411:03.92]Thank you.
[412:16.66]Time to see what's over here.
[412:22.70]From the very beginning of the game.
[412:24.48]Very excited.
[412:26.16]I feel really bad if there's crossbow bolts down here.
[412:31.29]Gonna be incredibly upset about it.
[412:33.43]It's down.
[412:39.60]Okay.
[412:45.61]Very cool.
[412:47.43]That song is absolutely, what's the word I'm looking for?
[412:50.77]Dope.
[412:53.37]Seriously, that song is dope.
[413:05.57]Okay, let's do it.
[413:08.71]Use the keys.
[413:17.55]What have we got?
[413:17.97]Is that poisonous?
[413:42.13]It is poison.
[413:44.49]Oh, shit.
[413:45.83]It's poison.
[413:58.57]Oh, let's go looks like we are a little bit of a poison shaggy is just Morty for Rick and Morty What was that you see that that was just like a car driving My god
[414:30.89]Did I miss anything back here?
[414:31.91]This poison isn't going to stay on the whole time, but what can I do?
[414:39.13]I'm not saying character-wise they're the same.
[414:41.03]I'm saying that vocally they are pretty similar.
[414:43.19]Now, what... Can I slide down here?
[414:50.45]When does it stop?
[415:04.13]Turned and bumped into me and it killed me.
[415:06.25]Okay.
[415:08.95]Piece of shit.
[415:19.39]So, there's probably a rhyme or reason for me to be able to actually just go like this and run really fast and not have the poison build up fast enough.
[415:25.57]Maybe jumping will slow it down.
[415:26.83]It does not.
[415:27.84]Just run before it fills up all the way and I should be okay.
[415:33.24]And I am okay.
[415:37.42]What do I do about this?
[415:38.14]I think you just follow it down.
[415:42.04]That's exactly what I'm going to do.
[415:45.89]I thought there was going to be a slide.
[415:48.59]I thought I was going to just start sliding down.
[415:51.39]Anything over here?
[415:56.20]There's a way down all the way.
[416:02.07]I think I just have to keep going.
[416:03.11]There's gonna be an item in one of these.
[416:04.75]What a bad time to leave.
[416:05.80]I gotta check every one of these holes, because you know there's gonna be an item in one of them.
[416:19.90]It has to be.
[416:21.00]Hello?
[416:21.28]Okay, well...
[416:32.40]Why was that guy so magical?
[416:40.75]Don't have enough.
[417:03.77]Am I safe here?
[417:04.29]Of course not.
[417:22.59]I thought there was going to be a second one on the other side going up and down.
[417:26.13]I didn't think that one changed tracks.
[417:36.58]Oh well.
[417:40.76]Ah, you gotta love those dungeons, right?
[417:44.28]You gotta love those dungeons.
[418:12.60]I will eventually.
[418:13.28]Okay, I just have to be patient.
[418:17.27]Just be patient and stop doing that stuff.
[418:23.13]I know there's no items on any of the ledges or anything, so I can just run through.
[418:26.58]Okay.
[418:48.55]There's a guy in this one.
[418:50.49]No, there's a clone arrow.
[418:57.86]Yep, this guy here.
[418:59.48]Guy comes over here.
[419:00.24]Yep.
[419:00.40]I don't think I remember that.
[419:03.72]Okay, so now... I just gotta keep going.
[419:12.22]Just run, turn the corner, run, go.
[419:16.78]This thing does not stop.
[419:17.88]I need to find another little place to go.
[419:24.21]Right here.
[419:34.42]Let me get a good look first.
[419:35.76]I'm not just running down there.
[419:38.68]How far does it go?
[419:39.30]Does it go all the way around?
[419:40.14]Nope.
[419:41.69]Okay, it stays here.
[419:46.40]That doesn't seem like very far.
[419:48.06]Is there another safe zone?
[419:59.05]WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU- WHAT?!
[420:02.03]I was trying to spell the sprint button!
[420:05.00]What?! !
[420:13.00]That guy just fucking killed himself.
[420:15.38]He just fucking... He just jumped onto the tracks.
[420:31.27]Ugh.
[421:09.10]I thought it hit me.
[421:09.90]What did it hit?
[421:10.66]Was it a foul ball?
[421:11.56]What was that weird foul ball?
[421:16.08]Did it bump into my sword?
[421:18.02]I think my sword hit me in the head.
[422:03.94]Oh man, there's more, dude.
[422:09.89]Okay.
[422:10.73]Where's the next place to go?
[422:12.01]I don't see another place to go.
[422:26.34]It's right there.
[422:28.42]But do I follow it down?
[422:30.04]I think I have to follow this down because I'm not going to have enough time to run down that whole way.
[422:33.64]I got to follow it down.
[422:36.14]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[422:40.61]I got to follow it down.
[423:14.76]Pretending is exhausting.
[423:16.50]Okay, but I had the right idea, just I didn't- I caught the lip.
[423:26.46]You piece of shit.
[423:36.77]I probably could run all the way to the second thing.
[423:38.67]I can.
[424:10.39]Just phasing in and out of reality horseshit.
[424:15.27]Alright, turn, just go down.
[424:16.41]I know where to go from here.
[424:21.31]And then just follow it down.
[424:22.48]Goes wham.
[424:30.22]Hurry up.
[424:33.03]Hurry up!
[424:34.81]Just keep going.
[424:54.22]You had it?
[424:54.62]Am I gonna die here?
[425:04.13]Fucking camera sucks Okay, so you have to go you gotta just keep going Okay, so
[425:29.55]When you turn, you just have to run all the way to the bottom.
[425:32.36]I get it.
[425:32.82]Okay, this is the one.
[425:34.02]I'm gonna get to the bottom.
[425:44.70]Just keep going after that corner.
[425:45.88]Yeah, I'm just literally just gonna run.
[425:47.50]Just run, run, run, run, run.
[425:49.30]After that corner, just keep going all the way down.
[425:51.02]Run past the bridge and I'll be out of there.
[425:54.18]It's the last one.
[425:54.86]I promise I'm gonna get it here.
[425:55.98]This is it.
[425:57.84]This is the one.
[425:58.34]This is the last one.
[426:26.84]Don't push me into it don't push me into it All right, this is the one here we go, this is it ready when it goes up Okay when it goes up I'm running for my life I
[426:48.87]All the way.
[426:49.41]Don't stop.
[426:50.07]Don't stop.
[426:50.63]Don't stop.
[426:51.19]Don't stop.
[426:51.69]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[426:56.50]No stopping.
[426:57.84]Run.
[426:58.96]Run.
[426:59.98]Run.
[427:01.10]Run.
[427:02.24]Run.
[427:03.26]Run.
[427:04.22]Run.
[427:05.22]Go.
[427:06.20]Go.
[427:07.19]Go.
[427:08.21]Go.
[427:09.09]Save zone.
[427:11.41]Save zone.
[427:14.03]No, keep going.
[427:14.69]Keep going.
[427:15.03]Keep going.
[427:15.29]It's not here yet.
[427:22.12]Ah!
[427:22.98]Um, what?
[427:23.40]Where am I?
[427:23.86]Where do I go?
[427:30.10]Hey!
[427:37.44]Where is it?
[427:40.80]Where is it?
[427:43.02]Oh shit, it's still following me.
[427:44.56]Should I go?
[427:45.00]I don't know what to do.
[428:15.12]It's hard to tell.
[428:15.78]It goes all the way down.
[428:19.66]There's a little thing on the right.
[428:21.68]I think I can just sneak into the thing on the right.
[428:26.17]See that little, like, uh, nudge sticking out?
[428:28.87]I think I just go down there.
[428:29.99]I think so.
[428:54.33]What?
[429:01.88]Is there a bonfire down here?
[429:06.06]This is a boss down here.
[429:09.46]Are you kidding me?
[429:11.56]There's no bonfire or anything?
[429:13.36]I can respawn here.
[429:17.11]Let's go.
[429:25.90]Who's down here?
[429:54.55]What the fuck?!
[429:59.62]Holy shit.
[430:02.44]Holy shit.
[430:14.01]This thing's crazy.
[430:23.04]All right.
[430:24.18]So let me see.
[430:25.02]Put the headphones in.
[430:25.60]Let me see if he does.
[430:27.48]He has like these like... I'm thinking stay in his back.
[430:41.89]Stay in his hind legs.
[430:46.57]He's just so big.
[430:47.41]He takes up the whole room.
[430:50.33]Yeah, it's definitely right.
[430:51.27]It's definitely his back.
[431:21.54]Damn.
[431:27.30]So... I don't know.
[431:30.08]It's such a tiny little area.
[431:33.93]You still have the shitty default shields from the tutorial.
[431:36.63]I don't know.
[431:37.27]I don't.
[431:38.83]I don't.
[431:39.13]What?
[431:39.37]Can I block?
[431:49.94]Maybe this is a block fight.
[431:57.80]Honestly, I think you just have to stay right behind him.
[432:01.45]Stay right at his ass.
[432:08.15]Yeah, I'm thinking... Try to stay behind him.
[432:13.82]His tail kind of swings around.
[432:15.26]Does not look that effective.
[432:21.74]I had the right idea, I think.
[432:22.80]Just try to stay... And I'm... I'm not doing... There's no time for spells here.
[432:27.51]This really sucks because I cannot change the allocation.
[432:30.35]I have to beat him with four flasks.
[432:32.86]Boys don't work down here.
[432:34.20]I can't even summon the boys even if I wanted to.
[432:37.86]What am I talking about?
[432:38.52]Here they come.
[433:00.17]Jesus.
[433:04.98]Dude, this guy is just a fucking slug.
[433:32.20]he's one of those bosses that you don't know what he's attacking when he's just moving his body it's the fucking tail the tail is sensitive
[433:58.33]You know what I mean?
[433:58.81]Like, which one of those is attacked and which one is this guy just moving around the room?
[434:11.40]I think it's the tail.
[434:27.69]Someone's Rotten Stray Spirit.
[434:29.16]Let's try that.
[434:31.64]Here it is.
[434:32.08]Rotten Spirit versus Rotten Spirit.
[434:36.38]Might be about the flasks.
[434:37.78]Yeah.
[434:38.86]Well, let's see.
[434:39.62]I mean, this guy's insane.
[434:48.49]So, there's no distance, really.
[434:49.95]Let me see.
[434:53.99]Maybe the belly?
[435:10.41]This guy's fucking ridiculous.
[435:28.32]It's not the face.
[435:56.86]I mean, how do you even decide when he's going to attack?
[436:01.95]How are you supposed to even know?
[436:08.59]This dude is just crazy.
[436:12.30]Are the claws?
[436:12.99]They're so under leveled though.
[436:25.63]What about maybe distance?
[436:26.76]Maybe distance is better.
[436:29.98]Hell no.
[436:31.94]I can at least see what he's doing, right?
[436:38.58]I think that's the play.
[436:39.36]I really do.
[436:39.82]Never mind.
[436:48.10]I think this boss is like 10 bosses.
[436:51.22]Try sorcery.
[437:03.07]I don't think I'm ready for this dude.
[437:04.93]He's crazy.
[437:05.67]Let me try sorcery.
[437:10.17]And just, like, run away.
[437:10.99]Can I two-hand the staff?
[437:13.23]Can I two-hand the staff and that's how you charge?
[437:14.65]I wonder if I can do something weird here.
[437:17.47]Hold on.
[437:21.97]Let me two-hand the staff.
[437:24.23]Can I actually... No.
[437:27.34]That doesn't work.
[437:28.94]Oops.
[437:39.74]Doesn't seem particularly weak to it either.
[437:45.84]Well, now I don't have a weapon.
[437:49.63]I will block your attacks!
[437:57.41]Nail's best bet, but... Spam heavy attacks with the, uh... With the rapier?
[438:03.74]Carry him?
[438:09.55]You're just punching the dude.
[438:22.59]That's worth it.
[438:23.21]I think it's worth it.
[438:23.89]Let's try it.
[438:25.68]There's no way I beat this boss.
[438:26.74]What about fire?
[438:42.66]I don't even know if it hurts him.
[438:43.68]I mean it does.
[439:05.89]Oh, there's no way I'm supposed to be here.
[439:11.67]Hey, you wanna fight the boss?
[439:13.48]Alright, here you go.
[439:15.54]You wanna fight this game's boss?
[439:18.85]This sounds fun.
[439:21.55]Alright, here's your screen.
[439:22.58]It's time for you to fight the boss.
[439:42.59]Good one.
[439:43.01]Thanks.
[439:57.44]This ain't happening.
[440:00.68]It's not happening.
[440:02.12]I know where they are though.
[440:03.16]I know where this thing is.
[440:05.22]What happened to my sound?
[440:25.05]But I wanna fuckin' beat him, you know what I mean?
[440:27.87]Like... I know, I- I- like this is just- game just gets- you get obsessed with something, and you can't leave.
[440:35.34]Even though I'm like 30 levels underleveled for this dude.
[440:38.84]I've used fire, but I'm gonna waste so many materials.
[440:45.67]That's- no, I'm not gonna be able to do it.
[440:47.83]He's too spammy, I- I need to be able to eat hits.
[440:50.35]And at this stage of the game, I cannot.
[441:01.29]Damn he still hit me with it No fucking way no way that's not happening I need a I need a health bar three times as big as this Twitter omegalow
[441:39.78]Alright, I know, but it's so hard to leave.
[441:42.11]Don't you know?
[441:42.59]Okay, it's so hard to leave.
[441:45.87]Because if I beat this guy, oh my god, it'd be a huge deal.
[441:49.53]Like, oh, but did you see what the streamer did?
[441:50.97]The streamer, like, beat this fucking Godric the Tree ulcer.
[441:55.35]He actually beat him, and he's not supposed to be here, and holy shit, wow, like, what a gamer.
[441:59.64]I want that.
[442:01.18]I need that.
[442:26.53]What the hell are you doing?
[443:15.22]Were you guys there?
[443:15.94]The German 985 beating ulcerated tree spirit at like level 31?
[443:21.14]Were you there?
[443:48.56]That's dumb.
[443:52.65]That's dumb too.
[443:53.23]Like that was dumb.
[443:53.83]Does this guy even have blood?
[444:22.91]Let's go.
[444:53.67]Fuck you!
[444:54.21]You weren't even moving!
[444:54.91]Attack moves!
[445:00.01]No, I'm serious.
[445:00.57]Were you there when I did this?
[445:01.50]Because I'm going to do it.
[445:02.74]Especially with this build.
[445:18.87]All in health potions?
[445:19.77]I could go get health potions only, but I'd have to make the whole trek back down here.
[445:27.12]I ain't coming back down to this piece of shit.
[445:29.06]He's dead now.
[445:33.83]I fucked that up.
[445:34.43]It's alright.
[446:07.27]Thank you.
[446:47.42]No fuck all right wait, what does he do it's like 50% Oh
[447:29.10]I gotta unbind crouch.
[447:34.10]Worst fucking thing in the whole game, seriously.
[447:41.58]Like, honest to God, that's such a bad place to end.
[447:47.11]Like... Having to, like, unbind left stick and rebind it, like... Stop squeezing the controller.
[447:54.23]Do you see the game?
[447:57.31]This is not like Mario Party.
[448:00.32]This is not Mario Party 2.
[448:03.76]What?
[448:04.24]How are you not... What?
[448:07.82]I'm not sitting here like...
[448:14.66]Oh, watch out!
[448:16.04]Watch out for the mushroom!
[448:17.86]I'm gripping this thing like it's fucking about to strangle me.
[448:26.09]I'll get this.
[448:26.65]I'm fucking beating this boss.
[448:27.85]You bet your ass I am.
[448:32.42]I don't need full Estus.
[448:34.26]I don't need it.
[448:40.32]I think I broke my audio cable.
[448:46.11]Audio is only coming out of one ear.
[448:47.43]It's weird.
[448:51.05]Okay, I got it.
[448:52.41]I got this motherfucker right now.
[448:54.79]I forgot to unbind it.
[448:57.75]Just kill me.
[449:17.36]You know, okay, you know how they make it not awful?
[449:21.32]Is if you have to hold it for, like, a full second.
[449:25.02]Like, if it was, like, hold left stick for, like, one crouch.
[449:29.30]Like, who's crouching in any of these fights?
[449:32.80]I'm gonna give the fucking boys a call on this one.
[449:38.79]You better believe it.
[449:41.73]You better believe that I'm giving them a ring-a-ding-ding.
[449:55.50]Not B. Fuck!
[449:56.81]What did I just do?
[449:57.27]Okay.
[450:02.89]Fuck!
[450:03.47]Settle down.
[450:03.93]Stop swearing.
[450:05.31]Alright, let's go, boys.
[450:08.32]Bring him up!
[450:12.21]It takes too long to cast it.
[450:13.35]It's not worth it.
[450:25.58]It takes way too long to cast.
[450:26.95]It's just guaranteed to get hit.
[450:42.60]That's a waste of time.
[450:44.76]You have to literally go like this.
[450:47.22]He's literally got you in his mouth already.
[450:57.35]Do it on the second phase.
[450:58.93]It's not a bad time to do it.
[451:00.27]If I just focus and just fucking go hit him in his gut.
[451:03.61]All right, quiet, quiet.
[451:37.12]Knew he was gonna do it.
[451:47.07]Fuck you!
[451:47.65]I wasn't even there!
[451:48.69]Fuck that!
[452:02.02]You don't have any time to fucking do that at all.
[452:04.54]There's no time to run.
[452:05.58]At least I know what time he does it.
[452:18.81]Don't do it again, man!
[452:28.10]No!
[452:28.54]It's so slow!
[452:34.80]Wait, he blows up more than once?
[452:37.44]I thought that was just like a, I'm going to phase two now.
[452:43.56]Walking on sucks because like it locks onto one central point and you might, you can't get close enough sometimes.
[452:59.36]Between each phase, does he only have two?
[453:10.41]Fucking settle down, dude.
[453:11.31]You know what's really killing me is the stamina.
[453:26.43]I just don't have enough.
[453:29.59]Just like, if I had like 10 plus more points in stamina, maybe this would be like much, much easier to do.
[453:44.20]We see your heart rate.
[453:45.42]It's probably like 280.
[453:46.88]I don't like locking on.
[453:54.76]Okay.
[454:13.35]I got him pretty close a few times ago, but I... I'm just... I'm just not supposed to be here.
[454:20.07]And... What's 5 out of 10?
[454:42.38]What you decide to do, you burn all your cooldowns?
[455:15.76]Alright, here comes phase one.
[455:16.78]Phase one incoming.
[455:17.78]Phase one outgoing.
[455:19.36]Phase one outgoing.
[455:21.48]Not yet?
[455:21.90]When?
[455:26.53]Phase one outgoing!
[455:34.11]Where is it?
[455:36.47]He should have done it by now.
[455:43.53]Why isn't he doing it?
[455:44.23]What the fuck's happening?
[456:21.51]Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!
[456:24.51]He does it twice.
[456:25.37]Yes!
[456:39.50]Yes!
[457:04.89]God damn it.
[457:05.67]If I just had a little bit more attack power.
[457:08.63]Just a little bit more.
[457:11.01]The fucking flasks are killing me.
[457:14.04]I got this.
[457:14.96]I really do.
[457:16.58]I got this.
[457:18.66]It's the four fucking flasks.
[457:20.26]I'm about to go back and just put the two in and just run back down here.
[457:25.33]I have this stupid goddamn mage shitclass.
[457:30.27]I have four heals.
[458:14.49]Oh my god, it's so frustrating.
[458:16.99]I just wish there was a fucking bonfire down here.
[458:22.95]Just give me my two other flasks and this guy is dead.
[458:28.98]All right.
[458:29.84]Three more attempts.
[458:30.90]If I can't beat him, then I'm going to go bonfire, get two more flasks.
[458:35.74]And no, this one doesn't count.
[458:37.24]This piece of shit.
[458:38.98]I'm literally talking and he has the balls to fucking attack me while I'm talking.
[458:55.47]How come you guys are counting to 10?
[458:56.82]Why?
[458:59.60]Okay.
[459:02.58]Because you know what?
[459:03.32]Even upgrading the... 2020 hindsight, man.
[459:28.72]Is he gonna do it?
[460:03.88]Dude, and I was ready for it too!
[460:24.67]What?!
[460:25.21]I didn't dodge through him!
[460:38.18]No, I'm fucked.
[460:38.96]I'm fucked here.
[460:54.57]That tail swipe sucks.
[460:58.61]That tail swipe is like, holy shit, man.
[461:01.01]He like spins, but you think he's gonna go up?
[461:04.69]But he just doesn't, and he'll just swipe you with the tail.
[461:11.43]Alright, this is the last try before I get more heals, and what I was going to say is, 20-20 hindsight.
[461:16.95]Claws were the thing to upgrade.
[461:18.91]Unfortunately.
[461:28.18]Even if you try to dodge through it, like, sometimes you just can't fucking do anything.
[461:31.38]Fucking games, fucking stuff, fucking god damn shit, fucking idiot, fucking god damn shit, fucking idiot game.
[461:36.31]Fucking god damn shit, fucking idiot game.
[461:44.55]this one's okay this one doesn't count like I I have to try to beat him now because there's no way I'm gonna come back here later and like remember all this this idiot does
[462:27.08]Thank you.
[462:53.79]It's just like... It's just way too hard for the level I am.
[462:59.72]Sucks.
[463:00.10]Because I don't want to come all the fucking way back down here.
[463:25.93]so so so
[464:00.80]I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if this is a good idea.
[464:32.83]so so
[464:54.96]Thank you.
[465:17.72]I'm sorry.
[465:39.04]so so
[466:19.82]Were you here?
[466:20.88]Were you in the room?
[466:22.42]Were you in the fucking room?
[466:33.01]Oh, it feels good to beat that motherfucker.
[466:49.55]I'm coming to dandruff.
[467:01.01]2020 hindsight, these gloves, I should have upgraded them.
[467:05.39]Oh my god, it feels good.
[467:12.41]So what was that?
[467:13.01]Is that a new thing?
[467:19.20]Summon Spirit of the Banished Knight Oleg.
[467:23.44]Oh, dude, we've got a new best friend here.
[467:25.94]We've got a new bro here.
[467:28.14]Really?
[467:29.93]What does it do?
[467:32.07]Holy shit, I have, like, a dual welding.
[467:37.73]Oh, man, this is gonna be sick.
[467:39.09]He's 100 FP.
[467:39.57]Wow.
[467:39.83]Wow.
[467:48.41]I'll be honest, I thought I was dead.
[467:50.41]I thought he did that... Did you see that bullshit?
[467:53.83]He did the exploding thing.
[467:55.46]That wasn't a phase change.
[467:56.72]That's just a thing that he can do.
[467:59.84]That bastard just does that move normally.
[468:01.92]I don't think that's a phase change.
[468:03.04]He did it like three more times.
[468:10.38]You've got your gamer license renewed.
[468:16.74]You missed the last tail thing, you didn't dodge it.
[468:18.52]I think I was too close to his stomach, so the tail just didn't... I just got lucky at the end.
[468:28.28]Oy, alright.
[468:29.84]I'm probably gonna have to say that's probably where I'm gonna call it for today.
[468:34.44]Because I need to go eat food and go take like a cold shower, because that was seriously like... I'm like a lightning bolt right now.
[468:43.37]Ugh.
[468:50.32]You know what I have to stop doing?
[468:51.44]I have to stop doing, like, Emperor Palpatine.
[468:53.38]You guys know what I'm saying?
[468:56.46]Like, yeah, should I have probably been here?
[468:57.70]No.
[468:58.32]But, like, every three or four deaths just be like, I can't do it.
[469:01.46]I can't do it.
[469:01.84]No, I'm too weak.
[469:02.98]I'm too weak, Anakin.
[469:03.90]No, I'm too weak.
[469:04.48]I can't do it.
[469:05.10]No, I just, I can't.
[469:06.56]I can.
[469:06.86]I just did.
[469:07.58]Get the item?
[469:15.32]I'm going to make sure I don't want to miss anything here.
[469:17.58]Is there actually an item that I missed?
[469:40.23]Yeah, I already got the item.
[469:42.82]I got the item up the slope, didn't I?
[469:48.58]Okay, let me upgrade.
[469:49.66]Oh, man.
[469:53.29]I'm so glad that I didn't give up.
[469:56.03]Damn.
[469:56.57]Okay, let's do health.
[469:58.21]No.
[469:59.81]Dex.
[469:59.95]Dex.
[470:04.79]There were two ways?
[470:05.53]Oh, wait.
[470:07.21]Maybe it's just off.
[470:09.31]The boss is dead.
[470:10.07]Let me just see if it's turned off.
[470:11.47]There was another way to go.
[470:12.41]Hold on.
[470:12.67]Let me go check that out.
[470:23.26]It's definitely worth going up.
[470:26.18]Never go back down here ever again.
[470:27.66]Oh.
[470:38.03]Just that last moment when I... Hold on.
[470:42.67]This was stupid.
[470:45.89]The last moment when I... Okay, I... I'm trying to do, like, a motivational speech, okay?
[470:56.21]And again.
[470:56.55]And again.
[470:57.53]No sorcery.
[471:02.50]I want all the doubters to remember that you said that I was a casual sorcerer and I only do sorcery and I'm a loser.
[471:08.56]Well... What do you think about that?
[471:26.57]All the way.
[471:26.89]Don't stop.
[471:32.15]Don't stop.
[471:32.73]Don't stop.
[471:33.21]Don't stop.
[471:33.65]Don't stop.
[471:34.13]Don't stop.
[471:34.65]I'm out of stamina.
[471:36.13]That's not good.
[471:39.83]Don't stop.
[471:42.19]Going up.
[471:45.59]And I'm going to chill.
[471:46.27]Okay.
[471:51.12]So now... Where does this go?
[471:59.62]It doesn't even come up here.
[472:06.00]Am I certain- WHAT THE FUCK?!
[472:14.29]Dude, are you- do you see how many fucking swings?
[472:17.09]How did I beat that boss with this, like, level 2 weapon?
[472:21.59]How is it possible that I just beat that guy?
[472:24.99]I just got possessed by a gamer demon, there's no way.
[472:26.95]Like, I just had to hit that guy, like, six times.
[472:30.18]What?
[472:34.53]Excuse me, I'm in the safe zone.
[472:38.31]What the fuck?
[472:40.03]I just cut my nose off.
[472:41.65]That was horse shit.
[472:43.88]Oh, I gotta get these souls back.
[472:46.64]That's dirty.
[472:47.18]I don't know where that's been.
[472:48.44]It's been in my ear, but you know what I mean.
[472:51.00]What, did I put it on my ass?
[472:53.88]I really want to be able to hear the music.
[472:56.36]Feel the music.
[472:58.23]That's right.
[472:58.79]Tonight's gonna be a good night.
[473:03.87]I'm fucking done.
[473:17.23]Don't make me laugh.
[473:18.21]Don't make me laugh because I seriously... Okay, put on the other weapon because... How the fuck did I beat that?
[473:23.77]I seriously have no idea how that happened.
[473:28.13]I can't die here though.
[473:29.29]And please, give me a break.
[473:31.49]All the shit taunters.
[473:33.05]Uh, goodbye.
[473:34.76]I'm too tired.
[473:39.22]I'm fucking gone.
[473:40.52]I'm like gone.
[473:41.46]I'm actually gone.
[473:43.34]I don't know.
[473:43.62]People are like, what are you fucking talking about?
[473:45.32]I don't know.
[473:45.74]I have no idea.
[473:50.26]I'm just like, it's equal parts excitement, equal parts like relief, and equal parts fucking hungry.
[474:07.04]I don't remember.
[474:07.54]Is this the one where you... No, it's not.
[474:13.53]Here we go.
[474:13.95]Are you still shooting the arrows at me?
[474:18.40]Don't stop going.
[474:19.18]Don't stop going.
[474:19.90]Just go.
[474:20.52]Go.
[474:20.98]Go.
[474:21.44]Go.
[474:21.92]Go.
[474:22.38]Go.
[474:22.84]Go.
[474:23.30]Go.
[474:23.70]Don't stop.
[474:25.50]Don't stop.
[474:26.94]Don't.
[474:27.82]Stop.
[474:28.94]Don't.
[474:30.08]Stop.
[474:31.24]Don't.
[474:32.22]Stop.
[474:32.52]For anything.
[474:34.34]And you're gonna bang a right.
[474:36.93]Bang a right.
[474:38.05]Don't stop.
[474:38.95]The edibles are kicking in.
[474:40.45]I stop here.
[474:41.13]No, I don't.
[474:41.45]This way.
[474:46.13]Holy shit!
[474:46.83]It's a grapevine!
[474:58.58]Where's it going?
[475:13.17]Do I follow it?
[475:15.91]I kinda think I should follow it.
[475:21.18]I think I follow it.
[475:28.90]No, it's too fast.
[475:31.60]Forget your souls.
[475:32.32]They're up here.
[475:34.70]I actually don't know if I should wait or if I should follow it.
[475:38.22]Going for it.
[475:38.60]Fuck it.
[475:38.82]Who cares?
[475:47.50]Hey!
[475:48.00]Hey!
[475:48.39]Hey!
[475:48.79]Hey!
[475:49.17]Not fair!
[475:49.67]It's not fair to push people out of the way!
[475:56.13]Whoa!
[476:03.33]This game is fucking so easy.
[476:05.29]Like what?
[476:05.55]People think this is hard?
[476:06.33]This is like boring.
[476:09.77]I am bored out of my fucking mind right now.
[476:21.02]Who's this guy?
[476:34.96]Now, excuse me when I say, where does the thing end?
[476:36.80]Let's do teleports around.
[476:42.12]Give me the item.
[476:52.58]Holy fucking moly!
[477:15.06]Yeah, I killed him.
[477:33.12]Gotta go get him.
[477:34.12]Gotta go get that item.
[477:39.96]I thought it was gonna stop at the ledge.
[477:42.21]I didn't think it was gonna go all the way up.
[477:43.35]I didn't forget.
[477:43.95]I just figured it hadn't come- Look.
[477:45.97]It hadn't come up in a long-ass time.
[477:50.99]It didn't come up.
[477:52.99]It took, like, that was like a minute or two.
[477:55.35]It didn't come up.
[478:00.10]That actually is such a shitty place to die, though.
[478:02.24]Because, like, I freaked out and almost... I just... I gotta get... What on earth am I doing?
[478:10.15]I think... I don't think I can use this.
[478:18.19]Honest to God, I don't think I can... Because there's two people.
[478:20.59]I gotta have... You are pissing me off and it's really starting to show.
[478:32.84]You don't stop, right?
[478:41.07]Why do I hear it?
[478:42.41]Why do I hear it behind me?
[478:45.15]Why do I hear it behind me?
[478:46.57]Why do I hear it?
[478:47.58]What?
[478:48.08]It's over.
[478:48.52]I lose.
[478:53.60]I thought you didn't stop.
[478:54.54]I thought you just kept going.
[478:55.44]I timed it wrong?
[478:57.48]Well, I want the fucking item.
[479:00.38]I want the item.
[479:01.68]Stupid train bullshit.
[479:05.45]Minus 7k.
[479:06.23]Whatever.
[479:06.51]I had plus 15.
[479:08.19]So, who cares?
[479:11.91]Such a stressful piece of shit area.
[479:18.93]You stop one more time before... Because it turns around.
[479:21.98]I forgot.
[479:22.34]I thought it just kept going.
[479:34.14]The fact that it one-hit kills you is your patch-it.
[479:35.90]It's not fair.
[479:46.27]Can I Mario 64 this?
[479:47.05]Wait a minute.
[479:53.96]Can I actually Mario 64 slide level this?
[479:59.68]That guy every time, I seriously fucking hate that guy.
[480:19.10]Do I die if I jump down here?
[480:35.85]I didn't get hurt at all.
[480:45.01]I'll take it.
[480:45.37]I don't care.
[480:45.73]How come I'm not using... Are you kidding me?
[481:02.84]Oh, there goes 7,000 souls.
[481:04.84]That actually works.
[481:05.96]I don't know what the hell I did to make it so I... He's back?
[481:08.86]Why is he back?
[481:10.73]I killed his ass.
[481:15.89]I want the thing to come up here, because I'm going to get him killed by it.
[481:26.06]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[481:27.08]Follow me.
[481:29.00]Follow me.
[481:29.96]Come on.
[482:04.78]Shit!
[482:05.50]I didn't count.
[482:05.94]1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
[482:29.77]How did you come in here with me?
[482:56.36]One.
[482:57.28]Two.
[482:58.32]Three.
[482:59.36]Four.
[483:00.38]Five.
[483:01.36]Six.
[483:02.38]Seven.
[483:03.38]Eight.
[483:04.22]Nine.
[483:05.16]Ten.
[483:06.06]Eleven.
[483:07.00]Twelve.
[483:07.99]Thirteen.
[483:08.97]Fourteen.
[483:09.93]Fifteen.
[483:10.85]Sixteen.
[483:11.67]Sev- That's what you get for fucking teleporting around, you dick.
[483:23.18]I'll take the Dragon Command Seal.
[483:26.53]Get me the fuck out of here.
[483:33.82]What an asshole.
[483:36.84]Alright, get me out.
[483:38.52]Nothing else here, right?
[483:49.07]Why did he do that?
[483:53.93]Okay.
[483:57.01]I will... I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[483:58.43]That's it.
[484:06.47]Uh... That was pretty intense.
[484:10.26]Day of gaming.
[484:10.88]I was very upset.
[484:13.38]I was very happy.
[484:14.00]I was excited.
[484:15.02]I was annoyed.
[484:16.04]I was awestruck.
[484:17.02]It was everything.
[484:18.56]That was awesome.
[484:19.50]It was fun.
[484:20.04]I really wish I knew where this guy was because I've wasted like 15,000 souls being an idiot.
[484:27.13]How do I rate the game so far?
[484:31.26]Uhh...
[484:56.82]9.4.
[485:09.27]Oh, summon Oleg.
[485:09.83]Let's see what he looks like, yeah.
[485:12.05]Uh... I'm gonna have to reduce points.
[485:15.33]I would... Okay, when I first opened up... Okay, after the first, like, four or five hours of the game, I would say it was probably like, holy shit, this is a 9.8. 9.7.
[485:28.21]I need to see some of the story bosses.
[485:30.05]Because the first two story bosses really kind of looked kind of like the same guy.
[485:35.44]And they had really similar moves.
[485:38.20]All the other side boss stuff has been incredible.
[485:40.86]I want to see some more of the main story bosses.
[485:47.61]Because the first two were very, very similar.
[485:52.37]But, this game apparently has a shitload of bosses and a ton of places to go and see.
[485:58.11]I mean, I think it's phenomenal.
[485:59.89]I think it's an absolutely phenomenal game.
[486:06.10]I think it's really good.
[486:11.36]Some of the controls are a little weird, if I'm honest.
[486:14.90]And the more that I get frustrated by controls, the more that I might, you know...
[486:22.73]Like, the left stick thing has really kind of been annoying, if I'm completely blunt.
[486:26.72]I mean, I know it's like, well, just don't press it as hard.
[486:29.50]But, I mean, it's still like, it kind of happens all the time.
[486:34.33]Just by simply moving too far to the left or right of your controller can sometimes just have it hit.
[486:41.06]If you guys pick, like, an Xbox controller or a PS4 or PS5 controller, hold it in your hands and, like, move all the way to the right.
[486:48.68]And if you're, like, trying to move and dodge, it's way easier to push the stick in when you're all the way to the right or all the way to the left on the stick.
[486:58.38]You know what I mean?
[486:58.88]Like, I'm talking like this.
[486:59.84]So, like, you hold the button like this and you click, like, accidentally.
[487:04.72]You don't really want to.
[487:06.74]just standing still like yeah you don't like click it it's the pushing and like running and oops I clicked it happens a lot but to be fair I don't know where else it could even go I really don't I I don't know what that would how else you map this if it's not on like a keyboard because they put a bunch of other stuff in the game to have to use right so I don't know like how you make that better
[487:36.65]It's an Xbox One controller.
[487:44.11]I wonder if maybe the Xbox controller might be... Is it a little bit easier to accidentally push it in if you're pulling too hard?
[487:50.03]I'm trying to think of how hard you have to push in to actually... With the PS5 controller.
[487:58.38]Battles would help.
[487:59.40]Yeah!
[488:03.14]Yeah, that's actually a good point.
[488:07.69]Alright, Oleg, yeah, before everybody leaves, right?
[488:10.39]I'll see you guys tomorrow, though.
[488:11.25]We're gonna start at 4 tomorrow.
[488:14.77]It's at 4 p.m.
[488:15.49]Pacific.
[488:16.05]We're gonna continue Elden Ring.
[488:18.89]And then I probably... I don't know if I'm gonna do four days in a row.
[488:23.73]Because these streams have been really, like, beefy.
[488:26.51]But we'll be tomorrow.
[488:28.79]I'll be live tomorrow, pretty much all day and all night again.
[488:30.71]And let's go attack something so you can see Oleg.
[488:37.35]But, to answer your question in a very long-winded way, yes, I think the game is absolutely fucking phenomenal.
[488:44.29]It's really, really difficult, though, and... That's a good thing, and it's a bad thing, right?
[488:49.42]Like, it's an amazing thing to, like, accomplish something, but in the moment, sometimes it's just like... It's... I can't do it, like Palpatine, right?
[489:00.03]And there's still so much more to see, and so much more hard shit to do, but...
[489:06.36]The very final opinion you can really have is like, okay, the game's too hard.
[489:14.79]But eventually it isn't.
[489:19.21]Like, eventually it isn't.
[489:19.99]Like, once you actually figure out what you're doing and you, like, study bosses and you stop making the same mistakes you keep making.
[489:25.47]And I still make them all the time.
[489:29.21]It's actually awesome how hard it is.
[489:31.96]But sometimes you kind of look at it and go like, man, did I really?
[489:35.70]It took me like four hours to beat that guy.
[489:39.92]It's just like, holy shit.
[489:41.06]I feel like I'm an incredibly accomplished person.
[489:45.70]So it's great.
[489:47.28]As much as it can feel sometimes like it's too much.
[489:49.84]I can't do it.
[489:50.64]It's too fucking hard.
[489:53.04]Eventually it's not.
[489:55.04]All Souls games ever.
[489:56.07]Yes.
[489:59.77]There you go.
[490:00.07]This is my take.
[490:05.86]Need more FP.
[490:06.70]I can't even cast this.
[490:09.42]Really?
[490:09.88]How much FP do I have?
[490:15.31]Dude, I need way... I need a... I need to level up my mind.
[490:20.03]I can't even cast it.
[490:25.94]Okay.
[490:30.59]What's your take on frozen pizzas?
[490:32.33]Well, frozen pizzas are way, way too hard until they're not.
[490:37.26]When you put it in the oven and you spend some time seeing it and watching it cook and letting it do its thing for like 15, 20 minutes and you understand that you need to cook it first, it comes out and it's very edible and it's delicious.
[490:51.33]I would say the same exact thing.
[490:58.28]Okay, goodbye.
[490:58.90]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[491:00.52]Goodbye.
[491:00.86]I'll see you tomorrow.
[491:03.50]Take care of yourselves.
[491:04.97]See you soon.
[491:06.21]Good night.
[491:07.09]Goodbye.
[491:08.27]Take care.
[491:30.05]Actually, I'll play you the final song from Bloordow that I have.
[491:34.89]I feel like it's going to be a big hit.
[491:37.91]This is what will play us out tonight.
[491:41.13]See you tomorrow.
[493:35.53]you
