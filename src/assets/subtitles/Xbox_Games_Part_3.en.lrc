[ve:60.16.100]

[00:41.07]Yeah, yeah.
[00:44.87]Why are you acting like I?
[00:47.59]Delayed the stream two days ago.
[00:50.15]Delayed it again yesterday.
[00:54.46]And then came in today and reverse delayed back to today.
[01:00.12]but why you think I didn't do that this is outrageous yeah I figured alright so I got some stuff done that I wanted to get done and I did say wait we'll maybe we'll do an omega gaming weekend no no let's just go now I'm ready to hang out now for a little bit
[01:31.33]Sometimes, you know, you just get the urge.
[01:33.06]You want to go.
[01:37.76]So that's exactly what we're going to do.
[01:39.28]Welcome back.
[01:39.84]We're going to play Xbox games.
[01:42.10]Original Xbox.
[01:45.76]The plan is still on Saturday to play Elden Ring with Ster.
[01:52.30]So that's still the plan.
[01:56.55]You smell... You have no idea what I smell like.
[01:58.49]You have no idea.
[02:05.45]It's called Old Piss.
[02:12.47]Anyways.
[02:17.31]You need to change your pinned tweet.
[02:19.09]I don't think it's ever going to happen.
[02:20.51]You know what?
[02:21.61]My pinned tweet will change once... Honestly, probably when Grotto Beasts is ready and here and ready to go.
[02:32.48]That will be the pinned tweet very soon.
[02:37.28]A lot of things in 2023 that... I just... They're very exciting.
[02:42.74]And I don't know how to tell you them.
[02:45.70]But... I'm seeing a lot of copiums.
[02:49.02]I don't know.
[02:51.78]I don't know.
[02:52.08]Just wait.
[02:54.40]Just wait.
[02:55.81]It's... I'm not talking.
[02:59.01]I'm not saying anything.
[03:04.44]I'm not going to say anything.
[03:05.44]All I'm telling you is that Grotto Beasts is imminent.
[03:08.36]Very imminent.
[03:09.83]To a point that I think a lot of people might not understand.
[03:12.49]I think a lot of people are like, oh, yeah, he keeps saying it.
[03:14.61]Oh, it'll be a few months.
[03:16.27]It'll be a few months.
[03:19.09]Grotto Beasts is imminent.
[03:21.54]Imminent.
[03:26.43]But I want to give you a real date when I have it.
[03:29.54]But it's imminent.
[03:32.38]No, I didn't just learn that word today.
[03:34.78]I've said imminent a few months ago when I talked about this as well.
[03:39.81]I didn't just find that word out.
[03:47.56]I know words, guys.
[03:48.84]I know words.
[03:51.62]I have at least a higher functioning caveman intelligence.
[03:54.98]I know words.
[03:55.78]I have a vocabulary.
[04:02.73]Oh.
[04:04.01]Meteor.
[04:05.29]Imminent.
[04:06.97]Oh, what?
[04:07.63]What that word?
[04:09.29]Imminent.
[04:10.33]Meteor.
[04:10.93]Imminent.
[04:12.21]Oh.
[04:14.17]I say that word now too.
[04:20.59]Work.
[04:27.27]You should play Dark and Darker.
[04:29.07]I'm going to.
[04:29.63]I just have to find the opportunity when I want to do that.
[04:36.10]That game has gone into alpha for like a weekend, come out of the alpha weekend, go back into an alpha weekend, right?
[04:44.56]When it's in beta, when I can just play the game whenever I want, that's when I'll do it.
[04:51.23]Is it a closed beta?
[04:52.33]I really don't know.
[04:52.75]I haven't been really paying that much attention.
[04:54.17]I will be honest.
[04:58.12]Why do you hate The Last of Us?
[05:01.22]I've never played The Last of Us.
[05:02.52]You know what?
[05:03.08]That's a lie.
[05:04.20]I believe I'm... It's been a long time, so let me see if my memory can piece together.
[05:09.32]I think I did the PlayStation Now stream feature connected to a friend and played the game through their game.
[05:20.55]Am I making that up?
[05:21.79]It's been a while.
[05:25.89]And I think I played like the first 40 minutes that way.
[05:30.93]PlayStation had this feature where you could like stream the game to somebody and they could take control of it.
[05:37.27]It's very weird.
[05:38.25]Very weird system.
[05:44.79]Read this, read this, read this.
[05:47.43]Relax.
[05:48.21]Will you relax?
[05:55.10]share play yeah so yeah okay so I got like a I got like a 1500 bitrate share play version of the first 40 minutes of The Last of Us I I don't know I just didn't play it I didn't play it so what oh well I didn't play God of War either well I played the first hour of that it's phenomenal by the way that's the worst you could have played it yeah but what who cares
[06:27.37]But hope you're doing well.
[06:30.31]What a fake fan.
[06:31.49]I never told you I was a fan of The Last of Us.
[06:33.92]When have I ever talked about that?
[06:36.54]Has there been a stream where I've sat here and gone, oh, Last of Us.
[06:40.40]Let me just tell you all about it.
[06:42.92]Oh, I could talk for hours about Last of Us.
[06:45.02]That's never happened.
[06:47.54]Hurry up.
[06:48.32]You relax.
[06:49.66]Settle down.
[06:54.96]you I you did I remember it that actually kind of funny that actually would be really funny if somebody has like a clip from like a few years ago or something of me being like oh my god it's so good I just never played it that's funny I will accept that if that's the case
[07:17.42]But anyways, yeah, we're going to play more Xbox.
[07:18.74]We're going to start kind of right where we left off with Obi-Wan.
[07:22.85]We're not going to play Obi-Wan, but the one that's coming up in the list was the Da Vinci Code.
[07:29.44]Da Vinci Code.
[07:32.06]Are you guys ready?
[07:32.94]Are we ready to play a little bit of Xbox?
[07:37.13]And then again, next time I'll see you after this, the weekend Ster randomizer Elden Ring co-op stream is still happening on Saturday and Sunday.
[07:47.92]Well, Saturday and then if we, you know, we're giving ourselves the option to do it Sunday as well.
[07:52.72]Because what if we're just not having any fun at all?
[07:56.82]That's the plan.
[07:58.43]And let's go.
[07:59.77]I think we're ready to get rolling here.
[08:02.57]We just...
[08:06.17]Just make sure this is plugged in correctly.
[08:10.79]Let's see.
[08:11.13]Can you see it?
[08:19.98]By the way, haven't seen this movie either.
[08:24.85]I've never seen this movie.
[08:27.19]I've never, I've never, it's a book, right?
[08:30.09]Is it a book or a movie?
[08:31.43]I don't know.
[08:36.46]This is the Da Vinci Code video game based on the movie, based on the book.
[08:44.13]Okay.
[08:44.51]Alright.
[08:45.11]I'm ready.
[08:45.55]You guys ready?
[08:47.17]The Da Vinci Code.
[08:50.39]Whoa.
[08:50.53]Okay.
[08:54.69]New game.
[09:02.08]Okay.
[09:03.46]I would like to create a save game.
[09:04.90]Anybody played this?
[09:05.90]Is this any good?
[09:09.19]Tom Hanks is in this?
[09:10.21]I, I, okay.
[09:12.10]Here's the only way that I would say I think Tom Hanks is in this game.
[09:16.90]It's stuff like, oh, what are you talking about?
[09:20.58]Huh?
[09:21.90]We have to get over there.
[09:22.92]And it's just stuff from the movie that they just kind of sentence mix together.
[09:28.43]Right?
[09:28.65]There's option one.
[09:29.99]Option two is it's an impersonator.
[09:33.32]So I don't think this is, if it's Tom Hanks, actually like Tom Hanks as Da Vinci Detective, whatever he was.
[09:41.37]I would be surprised if it wasn't just like sentence kind of mixing from stuff he set up previously on the movie.
[09:46.31]Let's find out.
[09:48.11]Let's go.
[09:48.61]Start game.
[09:49.13]Let's go.
[09:49.35]Let's go.
[10:06.38]That's not Tom Hanks I am God's hand I serve God's will
[10:32.16]Kind of reminds me of Bale.
[10:32.96]Is that Tom Hanks?
[10:33.66]Is it?
[11:03.35]It kind of sounds like him.
[11:07.05]Is that actually?
[11:08.35]No, but it's from the movie.
[11:11.17]But it's not original dialogue.
[11:21.74]It's from the movie.
[11:37.00]That's a huge, heavy-ass painting.
[11:41.93]What?
[11:45.15]You should not have run, Monsieur Saunière.
[11:48.63]Now, tell me where it is.
[11:51.82]Please, I beg you.
[11:54.16]Where is it?
[11:56.76]Alright, alright, I will tell you.
[12:04.43]This is like shot.
[12:05.33]It's so intense.
[12:05.93]Where did he shoot him?
[12:10.67]What?
[12:37.63]Okay.
[12:42.16]Alright.
[12:43.82]What kind of game even is this?
[12:49.38]This is like a detective game?
[12:54.14]Search the body for clues relating to his death.
[12:57.73]Why is this in a window like this?
[12:59.75]This is in a window inside of a window.
[13:01.69]What did that say?
[13:05.09]Fuck.
[13:07.91]What the hell is going on here?
[13:09.07]Alright.
[13:09.79]The position of his feet reinforces the reference to the pentacle and the sacred feminine.
[13:14.61]I beg your pardon?
[13:17.35]Repeating a symbol is the simplest way to strengthen its meaning.
[13:20.87]Jacques Saunière positioned himself in the shape of a five-pointed star.
[13:24.42]That's not Tom Hanks.
[13:25.72]That's not Tom Hanks.
[13:27.70]Interesting analysis.
[13:32.28]That sounds like Ross from Friends.
[13:35.86]Is it?
[13:39.75]It's a pentacle, one of the oldest symbols on Earth, used over 4,000 years before Christ.
[13:45.47]Devil worship.
[13:46.51]It's an actor.
[13:47.45]No, the pentacle is a pre-Christian symbol that relates to nature worship.
[13:51.96]The ancients envisioned their world in two halves, masculine and feminine.
[13:57.06]It's the ancient aliens narrator?
[13:59.12]What?
[13:59.42]Oh, my God.
[14:02.52]Historians call the sacred feminine or ancient aliens.
[14:07.41]Sonier of all people would know this.
[14:10.80]Sonnier drew a goddess symbol on his stomach?
[14:14.56]Interesting.
[14:17.54]Wow.
[14:18.18]Okay.
[14:19.63]So, yeah.
[14:20.39]Yep.
[14:20.55]Alright.
[14:20.97]We saw that.
[14:22.27]What is this?
[14:23.43]He stripped himself naked, folded his clothes, and put them away from himself?
[14:28.67]That's a great Tom Hanks.
[14:30.61]It's rather meticulous for a dying man.
[14:33.43]I think he was trying to show us that everything he did had a purpose.
[14:37.96]Even his nudity may have meaning.
[14:40.70]What do you think about the use of his own blood as ink?
[14:44.18]Obviously, he had nothing else to write with.
[14:46.78]Actually, I believe he used blood such that the police would follow certain forensic procedures.
[14:52.27]I'm sorry?
[14:53.27]Look at his left hand.
[15:01.21]Hold on a second.
[15:01.78]I need to see where... Okay, it's this one.
[15:03.76]He's clutching a large felt-tip marker.
[15:05.86]It smells like alcohol.
[15:08.80]Wait, it's a marker.
[15:10.24]It's not blood?
[15:10.94]As I told you, we have touched nothing.
[15:15.86]Are you familiar with this kind of light?
[15:17.83]As you may know, police use blacklight illumination to search crime scenes for blood.
[15:22.71]As you know.
[15:26.79]So you can imagine our surprise.
[15:28.17]As you know, us detectives, we do these things.
[15:31.79]What the hell does this mean?
[15:33.77]That, monsieur, is precisely the question you are here to answer.
[15:38.71]What is this game?
[15:39.27]This is like a CSI game, but it's Tom Hanks and it's the movie?
[15:42.73]Does this happen in the movie?
[16:00.02]Sonnier was a Frenchman.
[16:01.65]He lived in Paris.
[16:03.41]This happens in the movies just like this.
[16:06.21]Precisement, Monsieur Langdon.
[16:09.19]I have seen a lot of death in my work, and let me tell you something.
[16:12.73]When a man is murdered by another man, I do not believe his final thoughts are to write an obscure spiritual statement that no one will understand.
[16:22.81]I believe he is thinking of one thing only.
[16:26.61]La vengeance.
[16:27.78]I believe Saunière wrote this note to tell us who killed him.
[16:32.92]Oh.
[16:33.94]But that makes no sense whatsoever.
[16:36.02]You told me Saunière was attacked by someone he had apparently invited in.
[16:39.74]Considering the circumstances, I would assume that if Saunière wanted to tell you who killed him, he would have written down somebody's name.
[16:46.76]Precisement.
[16:47.91]Precisement.
[16:49.71]Captain.
[16:51.17]One moment, please.
[16:52.15]Oui?
[16:56.28]No, I'm not skipping it.
[16:59.82]Unacceptable.
[17:01.08]I made it very clear.
[17:03.01]Captain, please excuse the interruption, but... Ce n'est pas le moment.
[17:07.83]I have deciphered the numeric code.
[17:09.87]We already got the code deciphered.
[17:11.49]Hey, ResidentSleepers, we already got the code deciphered.
[17:14.80]It took us 15 seconds in the cutscene.
[17:16.50]U.S.
[17:16.56]Embassy asks that you phone in as soon as possible.
[17:19.38]While I explain the code to Captain Fash, you need to make this call.
[17:24.74]Thank you.
[17:25.57]Where can I find a phone?
[17:28.77]This line is secure.
[17:30.17]You may use it.
[17:34.68]What that actually means is that phone is bugged.
[17:37.36]It's the most bugged phone we've ever had.
[17:44.90]I'm sorry, Miss N'Vu.
[17:46.72]I think you may have given me the wrong... No, that is the right number.
[17:50.42]It's the three-digit code on the paper I gave you.
[17:53.46]What?
[17:54.22]The embassy has an automated message system.
[17:56.27]It kind of looks like he's like, it looks like it's a little too tight.
[18:01.06]Okay, so examine an item first.
[18:03.12]I should look at that.
[18:03.90]Select item.
[18:04.20]Okay.
[18:04.34]What does it want me to do?
[18:05.84]What?
[18:06.00]I missed everything.
[18:06.78]Examine the item?
[18:07.30]Oh shit, okay.
[18:07.96]Clues.
[18:30.88]Okay.
[18:32.22]What game is this?
[18:33.18]No, we're not skipping.
[18:34.30]We have to follow the rules.
[18:35.49]Captain Fash is waiting.
[18:36.77]Please, speak with him.
[18:38.17]Captain Fash is waiting.
[18:39.49]Please, speak with him.
[18:40.15]Ooh.
[18:40.25]Who do I... I wasn't looking.
[18:41.17]Who do I talk to?
[18:41.99]Is it you?
[18:42.31]Captain Fash is waiting.
[18:43.47]Please, speak with him.
[18:58.24]Who is that?
[18:58.82]Who's captain?
[18:59.52]Where's the captain?
[19:00.50]Who's the captain?
[19:01.22]What?
[19:22.55]There's only like two people in the room.
[19:25.18]Dude, I can't talk to either of these people.
[19:27.20]How did I do this?
[19:27.64]Dark Souls music.
[19:28.32]Oh, look at that!
[19:49.47]Okay, use the phone to call the three-digit number.
[19:51.85]What was the number?
[19:58.85]Never heard of it.
[20:01.54]Mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci created the succession of numbers in the 13th century.
[20:06.90]Obviously, there can be no coincidence that all of the numbers Sonia wrote on the floor belonged to Fibonacci's same sequence.
[20:12.44]Stop talking!
[20:14.78]This isn't working.
[20:19.81]Three digit, four, five, four?
[20:22.73]I was gonna say that nobody has a three digit phone number.
[20:26.09]What is it?
[20:26.53]Like fucking 1400?
[20:29.69]I know that's a Family Guy joke.
[20:31.19]That's a Family Guy joke.
[20:32.38]I know.
[20:32.72]Oh, what is this?
[20:33.78]Is this three?
[20:35.86]Look, I get it.
[20:36.38]I know everyone's gonna spam that in a second.
[20:38.70]But a three digit telephone number?
[20:44.80]454.
[20:47.74]This isn't what I'm looking for.
[20:51.00]What is he saying?
[20:51.76]What does this mean?
[20:56.81]There's not a fucking phone number!
[20:59.13]I'm pissed.
[21:14.44]Captain, considering what you have at stake here tonight, I thought you might appreciate knowing that Jacques Saunière might be playing games with you.
[21:20.18]I got a -2 that says, be original.
[21:23.92]You no longer need our services.
[21:25.20]The person that made this comment is the real Peter Griffin is their name.
[21:30.43]That's the name of the chatter.
[21:32.63]An accident.
[21:33.23]A friend.
[21:35.87]You love that show.
[21:36.73]You should have been happy about that.
[21:37.99]Would you like to sit down?
[21:39.77]Actually, I think I'd like to use the restroom.
[21:42.91]The restrooms are at the end of the Grand Gallery.
[21:45.37]You should have been very happy.
[21:46.73]Can I accompany you?
[21:48.45]Not necessary.
[21:50.56]I think I'd like a few minutes alone.
[21:52.20]What, have I had to go to the bathroom?
[21:53.06]I must return to Monsieur Saunier's office for a moment.
[21:56.80]Please come find me directly when you are finished in La Trois.
[22:00.22]I'd like a little bit of privacy.
[22:01.22]There is more we need to discuss.
[22:02.86]No more than 45 minutes.
[22:04.66]At that point, it's a little too weird.
[22:06.78]Do you agree, Captain?
[22:09.33]I agree.
[22:09.79]I think that is correct.
[22:15.85]Thank God you came.
[22:16.77]We don't have much time.
[22:18.79]I wanted to warn you, Mr. Langdon, you are sous-surveillance caché.
[22:22.61]Under a guarded observation.
[22:24.50]Hit the fucking hand thing.
[22:26.78]Because Ash's primary suspect in this murder is you.
[22:31.04]Hit the hand dryer so nobody hears us.
[22:32.48]What is this?
[22:38.93]It's a GPS tracking dot.
[22:40.65]It continuously transmits its location to a global positioning system satellite that the DCPJ can monitor.
[22:46.22]Weird, it was stuck out of your neck.
[22:48.14]I don't know how you did not notice.
[22:49.52]It's accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe.
[22:52.86]They have you on electronic leash in case you decide to run.
[22:56.01]In fact, they hope you do run because it would make their case much stronger.
[22:59.93]Why would I run?
[23:01.47]I'm innocent.
[23:02.13]Do you recall the three lines of text that Saunière wrote on the floor?
[23:05.13]What you saw was not the entire message.
[23:07.79]This is a photo of the complete message.
[23:10.09]Why would Saunière write this?
[23:12.85]Was he trying to frame me?
[23:14.27]No.
[23:15.35]He wrote it for me.
[23:16.41]The numbered code is meaningless.
[23:18.13]Saunière wrote it to make sure the investigation included cryptographers, ensuring that I would know as soon as possible what had happened to him.
[23:26.02]Why you specifically?
[23:27.32]How do you know it wasn't for some other cryptographer?
[23:29.90]P.S.
[23:30.34]is the nickname he called me when I lived with him.
[23:32.28]All of a sudden, we're just going to hear a flush from the stall.
[23:35.42]We had a falling out ten years ago.
[23:38.06]Jacques Saunière.
[23:40.68]He was my grandfather.
[23:41.95]Where's Langdon?
[23:43.13]Still in the men's room, sir.
[23:44.63]We are seeing small movements, so the GPS dot is obviously still on him.
[23:50.13]Perhaps he feels ill.
[23:51.75]If he had found the dot, he would have removed it and tried to run.
[23:54.41]Hmm.
[23:55.29]Fine.
[23:57.63]Start screaming for no reason.
[23:58.52]What should I do?
[23:59.10]Fash will be taking you into custody any minute.
[24:01.44]You gotta just breathe in and out a few times.
[24:04.94]We need to act now.
[24:06.34]You want me to run?
[24:07.78]It's the smartest thing you could do.
[24:09.86]If you stay, you will spend weeks in a French jail.
[24:12.39]But if you get to your embassy, then your government can protect you while I prove you had nothing to do with this murder.
[24:17.59]Forget it.
[24:18.57]You need to tell Fash that the message on the floor was for you and that my name is not there as an accusation.
[24:23.96]Fash is convinced you are guilty.
[24:26.87]The only way to get you out is with a distraction.
[24:29.10]The GPS tracking dot?
[24:30.78]We need them to think you are running.
[24:32.90]If we can throw it out the window onto one of the cows going by, I bet a lot of the police would clear out.
[24:37.40]Wouldn't that be moving really fast all of a sudden?
[24:41.14]See if you can find something to attach it to that would make it heavier.
[24:47.61]Like, oh, wow, we picked up.
[24:50.01]Tom Hanks is now going 70 miles per hour right now.
[24:54.25]And weird, it looks like he was going like 100, 200 miles per hour out of a window.
[25:00.85]Like really fast, losing elevation quickly and then drove very fast.
[25:05.71]Hope he's OK.
[25:15.84]Okay, so I have to find something that's gonna weigh this down?
[25:23.16]I'm not leaving yet.
[25:24.26]No.
[25:28.59]I need to weigh it down.
[25:32.41]Is it like an examine button?
[25:41.34]There's a sneak button too.
[25:42.42]Alright, cool.
[25:48.27]You can pick up items like the soap.
[25:50.24]I can use this.
[25:51.02]Soap?
[25:51.88]That will work.
[25:53.06]Come, help me open this window.
[25:54.60]He opened every stall.
[25:58.84]Uh-oh, he's trying to get away.
[26:03.94]He's trying to sneak out the window.
[26:08.00]Where's Langdon?
[26:08.78]Still in the men's room.
[26:10.42]He must have broken the window.
[26:12.10]I knew it.
[26:12.70]He is trying to escape.
[26:17.05]Just go down the toilet.
[26:18.53]Hurry, Robert.
[26:21.17]Hurry, Robert.
[26:45.20]Hey, it was like minus 15 last night!
[26:47.24]It was frozen!
[26:49.27]Combine items.
[26:56.15]Hold on, they heard the wi- what?
[27:05.16]Hold on a second.
[27:32.81]These are the dumbest detectives I've ever seen.
[27:35.51]There's no way.
[27:37.61]If you're going to open up all of them.
[27:41.29]He's going to get a call on his phone at the last one.
[27:45.18]You have a new location?
[27:48.97]Yeah, of course.
[27:49.47]Of course!
[28:04.76]You pre-watched?
[28:05.76]No, that's just... Welcome to every single... We're trying to hide from someone.
[28:11.88]The numbers are a hint as to how to decipher the rest of the message.
[28:14.88]Wait, we're here.
[28:15.74]We're literally in the place.
[28:17.02]Tell us to apply the same concept to the text.
[28:19.79]Oh, draconian devil.
[28:21.37]Oh, lame saint.
[28:22.51]Those lines mean nothing.
[28:24.23]They are simply letters written out of order.
[28:26.73]You think this message is in Anacron?
[28:29.55]Like a world jumbled from a newspaper?
[28:31.71]Your grandfather's meaning was right in front of us all along, and he left us more than enough clues to see it.
[28:36.69]Let me see that photo.
[28:40.85]Oh, lame saint.
[28:46.60]Wait, what am I doing?
[28:52.68]What do I have to do?
[28:55.28]It's a puzzle.
[28:57.08]Do auld lang syne.
[29:02.92]How about... Let... Let... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[29:26.63]Let...
[29:36.70]Home?
[29:43.36]Let?
[29:47.09]Let him?
[29:54.23]Not let him cook.
[29:58.55]Am I... Let him...
[30:05.69]Oh, you have it in emote only.
[30:07.03]I see what you're doing.
[30:09.33]This game takes around five hours to complete.
[30:11.21]Two of them are cutscenes.
[30:12.37]Are you serious?
[30:14.26]Okay, um, I think, what about a hint?
[30:16.58]An anagram is when the letters of a word or words are mixed up to form other words.
[30:24.88]Uh, Captain, I think I see a couple people here that look like the perpetrators.
[30:31.90]No, it's definitely where all the rats hang out in the alley where the ping is going off.
[30:38.13]Okay, I guess I will just go back to what I was doing.
[30:46.67]It's going to be like the... The... The... The... The song... The same...
[31:01.47]The same... The same time!
[31:05.03]They were killed at the same time!
[31:07.71]I don't... I have no idea.
[31:20.35]I've ran out of hints.
[31:23.75]The... This... All...
[31:33.75]The... The main?
[31:39.49]Like, the main?
[31:43.27]The main street.
[31:44.90]The main sale.
[31:48.72]The main... The main... Lasso?
[31:53.24]I don't think that's correct.
[31:59.04]Oh, lame saint.
[32:02.56]Wait, what do you mean?
[32:03.46]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:04.44]What?
[32:05.32]That was correct?
[32:06.68]You think that was right?
[32:07.80]How do I check it?
[32:11.28]The main... Did I actually have it?
[32:17.70]Main lasso.
[32:22.32]I had it right?
[32:23.71]I'm pretty good at this then.
[32:24.57]Is that it?
[32:30.27]No, that's not... It's the main something then.
[32:36.88]The main... Wait, it is the main something?
[32:42.29]Stop posting a delicious meal.
[32:45.69]I've seen it a few times, and it's making me hungry, and I don't want to see it anymore.
[32:48.91]It's delicious, nutritious, and it isn't weird, and it's not a strange thing to eat sometimes, okay?
[32:57.00]The... Oh, sorry, I had a bunch of vegetables.
[33:00.16]Like, a ton of, like, really good for you, like, high in a bunch of different vitamins.

[33:43.74]Did they figure this out in the movie really early on?
[33:46.78]Does Tom Hanks go, O Lame Saint.
[33:50.32]The main silo.
[33:52.12]Does this actually happen in the movie?
[33:53.68]Is the answer in the movie?
[33:57.40]Is it really?
[34:00.62]It's in the movie.

[40:14.98]That can't be what, no.
[40:15.84]No, no, no, no, no.
[40:16.44]That can't be what it is.
[40:17.93]No, that can't be what it is.
[40:18.77]The shit that's on the fucking cover of the box.
[40:21.55]I did not know.
[40:22.29]I did not know that's what this game was about.
[40:23.63]I didn't know.
[40:24.81]I didn't know.
[40:25.99]I didn't know what it was.
[40:27.65]I thought it was one, I, that's the shit that's on, that's literally the front, that's on the box.
[40:32.09]The Mona Lisa's on the cover.
[40:33.77]But, like, I... And it burnt it into the screen!
[40:36.29]I was on it for so long!
[40:37.42]Alright, relax.
[40:37.94]I didn't... I've never seen the movie!
[40:50.09]This screen burning is so bad.
[40:50.83]I was on that for so long.
[40:52.25]That was painful.
[40:53.07]I didn't think it was gonna be...
[41:06.64]Dude, give me a break.
[41:07.92]I did not know what this movie was about.
[41:10.18]Well, you know, with Da Vinci, I... I didn't think they were going to give us spoilers in the first five minutes.
[41:17.33]I think he wants me to get to the Mona Lisa before anyone else does.
[41:20.41]I'll come.
[41:21.13]No.
[41:21.95]We don't know how long the Grand Gallery will stay empty.
[41:25.06]You have to go now.
[41:26.12]I will see you at the embassy, Monsieur Leda.
[41:27.64]I know.
[41:34.90]that's that person that uh okay wait new character okay so what's the objective find a uv light isn't that isn't that in the case over here
[42:02.27]The main... The main... What was it?
[42:05.01]The main lasso.
[42:10.70]I forgot this whole game was about a painting.
[42:13.96]Look.
[42:14.94]I know.
[42:15.44]Listen to me.
[42:16.82]I did... I forgot this.
[42:18.10]I'd never seen this movie.
[42:19.78]I haven't thought of the Da Vinci Code in... I don't know.
[42:22.99]At least... At least fucking 10 years.
[42:26.11]I don't even care when the movie came out.
[42:29.08]I forgot like DaVinci made the Mona Lisa and the whole thing is about like stealing the Mona Lisa because there's a secret in it.
[42:35.74]I don't know.
[42:37.64]I don't know what it was.
[42:38.40]I just looked at the cover.
[42:47.55]I need a UV light.
[42:53.41]You didn't know the Mona Lisa what?
[42:55.94]You didn't know the Mona Lisa was painted by Da Vinci.
[42:58.72]No, but I didn't, I guess I just didn't realize like that this movie in this game.
[43:03.86]Well, I don't, I don't know.
[43:05.10]I was just kind of, I was lost there for a second.
[43:07.58]I didn't.
[43:11.62]I know Da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa, but in my brain, they weren't going to start with that.
[43:16.16]Like the Mona Lisa was going to be like the big reveal at the end of the game.
[43:20.10]Not the first puzzle.
[43:21.93]You know what I mean?
[43:24.01]You're an iPad kid.
[43:24.91]I can't defend it.
[43:25.71]I can't defend it.
[43:26.83]I take the L. I can't defend it.
[43:31.09]It's the first thing they do in the movie is they go over that.
[43:33.81]I didn't see the movie.
[43:34.80]Guys, I don't even... I didn't care.
[43:41.07]For a second, I was blending two movies together.
[43:42.99]What's the one where Nick Cage... It's like American Treasures or something.
[43:51.14]And he's like, the Constitution or what?
[43:53.46]They both are the same movie.
[43:59.02]Alright, sneak.
[44:02.50]I don't know.
[44:02.96]It's like this relic that has all these secrets in it.
[44:05.48]It's like the Constitution had a bunch of secrets in it.
[44:07.84]The Mona Lisa has a bunch of secrets in it.
[44:11.63]Like, Leonardo da Vinci was, uh, like an alien, and he landed and taught everybody fucking technology, whatever the hell it is.
[44:18.36]I don't know.
[44:18.76]Oh, I thought that was a person behind a desk.
[44:27.02]I was like, why can they not see me?
[44:33.55]What are you-
[44:45.10]Oh my god, what's happening?
[44:51.65]Why is it fighting right now?
[44:53.33]Holy shit!
[44:55.27]Stop, stop, fight, fight!
[44:56.43]You are under arrest.
[45:12.41]Dude, I... That was an extraordinary reaction.
[45:18.55]I did not... I did not fucking think that was gonna happen.
[45:23.99]I knocked on the floor.
[45:25.95]And then they just punched me in the face over and over again.
[45:28.92]I didn't even know there was a combat in this game.
[45:37.16]What the hell was that?
[45:44.72]knock knock who's that you wouldn't even like oh who's that let me I can't even identify myself first that was out of that was that's crazy if the officer sees me he will not let me pass I must sneak by him
[46:15.21]okay this game just you all wanted me to skip we have melee combat in this game it was one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen in a game like what was the point of any of that so far so good
[46:45.25]Items you can use, be on the lookout.
[46:46.71]Can I just take everything?
[46:48.09]You can pick up weapons?
[46:51.23]What do you mean?
[46:51.95]Where's a weapon?
[46:52.39]You need to initiate a throw.
[46:53.21]During a throw... Okay.
[47:18.59]Why is this a wrestling game now?
[47:20.99]This is like turning into like Arkham.
[47:23.57]Defend begins when the enemy gets the upper hand.
[47:25.75]Counter the attack.
[47:36.32]When you start an attack, buttons appear at the bottom.
[47:38.16]Okay.
[47:41.56]Okay.
[47:59.16]I can and will defend myself.
[48:05.22]What?
[48:05.78]Stop!
[48:06.24]It's not fair!
[48:07.06]Why do I have to do a QTE every time I want to fight?
[48:09.34]Give me the weapon.
[48:09.87]Where's the weapon?
[48:12.03]There's supposed to be a weapon here somewhere.
[48:13.39]Where is it?
[48:17.41]Ow!
[48:17.89]Shit!
[48:20.43]You don't stand a chance!
[48:35.31]How do I get a weapon?
[48:40.19]Where is this weapon that apparently exists?
[48:45.17]You keep walking past it?
[48:53.68]Guys, it looks like somebody threw up on my monitor.
[48:56.14]I can't see anything.
[48:59.42]Where do you see?
[49:02.89]Ow!
[49:03.47]Shit!
[49:04.01]Where is it?
[49:06.29]I have the suspects.
[49:12.77]What do you see?
[49:13.39]Is it on the ground?
[49:23.43]It's on the floor.
[49:28.47]Guys, this shit burnt into the screen.
[49:30.29]It's hard for me to see what's going on.
[49:48.48]What was that?
[49:53.85]What's with the weird... Okay.
[49:55.67]Alright.
[49:56.13]This time, don't aggro everybody.
[49:58.57]Get the weapon.
[49:59.31]It says, get the whip on and equip it.
[50:01.89]It wasn't in French.
[50:03.11]It was just text on the screen.
[50:04.43]Okay.
[50:05.99]Okay.
[50:22.14]Okay.
[50:28.33]Let's go.
[50:29.45]Very nice.
[50:30.11]Keep going.
[50:30.59]Keep sneaking.
[50:31.97]Be looking for items you can use as weapons.
[50:34.45]Be on the lookout for items you can use as weapons.
[50:36.74]I don't see anything I can use as a weapon.
[50:47.67]No, I don't want to see this whole fucking tutorial again.
[50:56.80]Oh my god.
[51:02.92]Okay, alright, alright.
[51:05.52]I think I see it on the ground.
[51:06.38]Yep.
[51:12.86]Okay, let's go.
[51:21.06]Do not make me help you.
[51:23.02]How do I pick it up?
[51:25.76]How do I pick this thing up off the ground?
[51:28.58]Oh my goodness.
[51:33.70]How do I... This should be useful.
[51:44.76]Okay.
[51:45.26]This could be useful to Noxian.
[51:54.25]phone and would you really hit a lady?
[51:57.09]Get out of here.
[52:02.27]I love you.
[52:30.31]This thing sucks.
[52:32.71]Oh my god.
[52:35.22]Dude, I hit him in the face.
[52:36.26]Everybody relax.
[52:46.55]Oh.
[52:56.02]What?
[53:03.95]This fight is going on way too long, man.
[53:08.54]I will use force if necessary.
[53:11.30]We have been.
[53:18.18]I hope he will be alright.
[53:21.17]This looks useful.
[53:25.75]Wait, drag his body?
[53:27.01]To where?
[53:30.07]Why would I want to drag him anywhere?
[53:38.46]There's nowhere I can put him.
[53:41.06]Alright, let's go.
[53:42.14]I got a weapon.
[53:43.80]And now I need to look at the evidence area.
[53:47.81]Right?
[53:48.07]Examine, please.
[53:51.29]I'd like to examine that evidence.
[53:54.07]A. Not working.
[53:56.64]Maybe I can't have a weapon in my hand.
[54:09.54]What are you doing?
[54:10.32]Get out of there!
[54:11.12]I cannot satiate my bloodlust.
[54:14.89]Wait, why did I drop it?
[54:30.15]That's so unfair.
[54:31.09]Dude, can I just go into the evidence cabinet now, please?
[54:40.42]Nope.
[54:40.90]You can't be in anything.
[54:44.40]Oh, shit.
[54:47.83]Alright.
[54:48.19]I'm gonna beat the shit out of these guys now.
[54:49.81]I am pissed off.
[54:50.75]I am done.
[54:51.75]I am pissed off.
[54:53.03]I'm ready to... This is it.
[55:22.11]I thought I heard something they both right here
[55:46.48]How do I knock?
[55:47.96]Got it.
[55:57.18]First try.
[56:20.56]First try.
[56:29.58]There you are.
[56:31.66]Robert, I told you to get out of here.
[56:33.85]If I... Where were you?
[56:35.33]I had to get the blacklight.
[56:36.93]If my grandfather left me a message... I can't believe I fucked up that.
[56:39.77]I told you to leave.
[56:40.93]Why did Senor write my name on the floor?
[56:43.32]Oh my god, I'm never gonna live that down.
[56:46.62]The letters PS may mean Princess Sophie, but do they mean anything else to you?
[56:51.68]Anything at all?
[56:52.67]Yes.
[56:54.05]I saw the initials PS once, when I was very young.
[56:57.15]Sophie, this is crucial.
[56:59.01]Can you tell me that the initials appeared with a symbol?
[57:02.70]A fleur-de-lis.
[57:03.72]How could you possibly know that?
[57:05.62]I'm fairly certain your grandfather was a member of a secret society.
[57:08.88]The fleur-de-lis combined with the initials PS, that is the Brotherhood's official coat of arms.
[57:14.00]They call themselves the Priory of Scion.
[57:17.60]The Priory's membership has included some of history's most cultured individuals.
[57:22.63]Men like Botticelli, Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and more importantly, Leonardo da Vinci.
[57:33.61]The identities of living- My jaw hurts.
[57:35.58]That was like snapping.
[57:36.40]Ow.
[57:36.50]Ow.
[57:36.58]There is a lot we need to discuss, but I cannot afford to let them capture you, Robert.
[57:48.61]Ow.
[57:48.67]I thought he was implying that I was like drunk.
[58:18.78]Why can I see this?
[58:20.24]What do you see?
[58:23.47]Random symbols in my face.
[58:26.99]You see random symbols.
[58:28.49]Yes, yes, lots of them.
[58:29.43]This one looks like a P. This one looks like an E. Oh, God.
[58:32.89]Give me a break.
[58:37.81]Nice phlegm.
[58:40.73]Okay, it's going to be like... Of...
[58:45.38]They obviously are not random symbols.
[58:46.90]They're arranged.
[58:47.50]Yes, it does.
[58:48.62]This is somebody...
[59:11.25]Okay, so now what am I supposed to do about this?
[59:15.60]How do I solve this?
[59:16.48]Do I have to like highlight ones that match or something?
[59:22.18]Do I have to highlight the whole thing?
[59:26.76]Alright, maybe I have to just light up everything.
[59:30.37]Like just highlight it.
[59:31.39]Highlighting, highlighting, highlighting, highlighting.
[59:36.49]Highlighting every word.
[59:37.79]Highlighting every word.
[59:43.39]Oh, shit.
[59:48.01]Sophie, cryptology is your specialty.
[59:50.53]Any ideas?
[59:51.76]Well, there are several things that are important to remember.
[59:55.44]But a lot of it has to do with how common a letter, sound, or word is.
[60:15.13]Guys, I've done my fair share of the back of the Cocoa Puffs box.
[60:20.54]You don't think I know how to do this flawlessly?
[60:22.78]You know how many Captain Crunch boxes I've been through in my day?
[60:26.54]E. B?
[60:38.65]We?
[60:53.85]That's definitely E's.
[60:57.99]That's definitely a P. I'm going to say we.
[61:10.06]We.
[61:12.48]Was A. Right.
[61:14.56]There's going to be a lot of A's.
[61:18.24]This could be A. That could be A.
[61:28.53]This is probably A.
[61:29.11]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[61:31.24]K.
[61:31.28]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, A, B, C, D, E, that's F. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
[61:59.26]What did it mean?
[61:59.92]It's like he wrote this when they were like bashing the door down to come get him.
[62:12.93]What's the code though?
[62:14.07]What's the Da Vinci code?
[62:15.55]I'm going to solve it right now.
[62:23.19]Well, I was wondering if you had anything specific to tell me about this encrypted message.
[62:27.74]That's what I said.
[62:29.18]Wait.
[62:29.46]What's... It's this one.
[62:30.18]This is E.
[62:30.42]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[62:30.70]Anything come up more than 10 times?
[62:52.11]That's what I was saying.
[62:53.11]I had the formula right.
[62:54.37]We're just going to find where A is, right?
[62:57.25]How am I supposed to?
[62:58.13]How would you ever do this?
[62:58.97]Okay, this is E. This is maybe like of.
[63:05.06]Or like to.
[63:07.70]Of.
[63:12.04]This is probably T. The.
[63:18.29]That.
[63:19.91]That.
[63:22.69]That... That these... That... And... The... The... What?
[63:42.92]Painting?
[63:44.00]Painted?
[63:44.44]I...
[63:51.65]Does something painted those... Those?
[63:53.47]These or probably those?
[63:58.69]Does it painted those that...
[64:21.13]Lies.
[64:29.49]Lies.
[64:32.01]And lies painted those that between between between those that knew
[64:50.19]New between... This is wrong.
[64:54.19]It's not D. Maybe it is.
[64:57.83]Do?
[64:59.09]Wait, what?
[64:59.61]Oh, it's Da Vinci.
[65:03.01]It's Da Vinci.
[65:04.03]I'm thinking like... I don't know.
[65:06.05]Just relax.
[65:07.11]Relax, relax, relax.
[65:08.45]Da Vinci painted those that new... Alright, listen.
[65:13.07]I'm reading it like da painted to something like the.
[65:18.31]Oh my god, what's wrong with my brain today?
[65:20.94]I must be tired or something.
[65:23.30]I am probably tired.
[65:25.34]Da Vinci painted those that... knew between... Bacchus?
[65:36.71]Bacchus?
[65:40.47]Between Bacchus and... Why is the clue?
[65:54.04]But what's this?
[65:54.62]Yule?
[65:56.12]Da Vinci painted those that knew between Bacchus and... Yur... Yur?
[66:07.69]Yugiel?
[66:08.21]Uriel?
[66:10.51]Oh, I got it.
[66:19.25]Hey, you want to look behind the painting.
[66:24.54]Nice, I decrypted it.
[66:25.10]Bacchus in Uriel?
[66:27.18]Bacchus is the god of wine, and Uriel is an angel, if I'm not mistaken.
[66:31.58]There is a painting of Bacchus in the Grand Ballad.
[66:33.40]He forgot it was a Da Vinci game again.
[66:34.48]I keep forgetting.
[66:34.84]And Uriel is in Da Vinci's Madonna of the Rocks, which should be in there, too.
[66:38.39]Let's go.
[66:39.53]Robert Langdon!
[66:40.13]I keep forgetting this is a Da Vinci game.
[66:42.19]But wait!
[66:43.19]Robert is innocent.
[66:44.17]He did not murder Saunière.
[66:46.07]Et je n'avoue.
[66:47.13]Innocent or not, I have direct orders to arrest Robert Langdon on sight.
[66:51.20]I'm sorry, but I can't go to jail until I help Sophie find the real murderer.
[66:55.24]You are... working together?
[66:57.53]Robert, look out!
[66:59.87]What the?
[67:02.85]I thought it would be best if you would let me go.
[67:14.79]Ow.
[67:16.43]Was there this much fighting in the movie?
[67:23.98]Alright, take him.
[67:26.42]You take him.
[67:27.32]Where do we put him?
[67:35.30]Who cares?
[67:35.86]Alright, we got what we needed.
[67:37.90]Oh my god.
[67:42.28]Now... Now let's go.
[67:46.19]Search the pockets.
[67:48.37]You're Riel and John.
[68:24.33]Where the hell is this painting?
[68:31.59]It's actually, it's pretty dark.
[68:32.56]I can barely see.
[68:34.42]That means you guys can't see.
[68:35.46]I need to turn this up.
[68:39.08]I need to make this a little brighter.
[68:45.18]Hold on, give me one sec.
[68:47.87]It's dark.
[68:48.39]I don't know if this helps.
[68:56.02]Does that make this better or worse?
[68:57.64]Actually, kind of worse.
[68:58.44]I think the game's just supposed to be like this.
[69:03.20]Yeah, the game's just supposed to be like this.
[69:12.38]Okay, so... Where is this painting?
[69:16.50]I gotta find, like, three things.
[69:18.52]Oh, wait a minute.
[69:21.50]Saturn's sphere.
[69:25.35]And...
[69:27.59]Okay, so I have one of the planets.
[69:36.05]I have no idea which one of these is the right painting, considering that they're all so hard to even decipher what they are.
[69:45.40]Is it just not even in this room?
[69:53.51]Oh, I thought it wanted me to do it in here.
[69:59.74]Hmm... What does that mean?
[71:06.27]What?
[71:06.43]I was seeing if she was gonna fall.
[71:08.38]Back in the day when they were just QTEs for no reason.
[71:11.24]Zero.
[71:32.03]You gotta make it harder than that.
[71:33.01]One of the- I thought one of the paintings is ringing?
[72:02.13]Like wait, inside the painting is like a painting of a phone, but it's a real phone!
[72:07.00]Hello- that would've been fucking cool.
[72:11.60]Imagine like one of these, there was a phone and you could reach it and it was actually- it was a real phone.
[72:16.92]What do you- why would you not do that?
[72:21.01]And it was like embedded in the paint and it was flush with the paint and painting.
[72:26.39]So it was just like, what the fuck am I looking at?
[72:27.97]Hey, wait a minute.
[72:28.41]You reach in, it's like, what phone?
[72:31.07]I would be so much better at this.
[72:37.25]Where, where, where?
[72:37.95]Somebody's office was ringing.
[72:45.89]Where's this person's office?
[72:46.77]I wasn't even looking.
[72:53.34]Like, an office telephone was ringing, and it was like, oh, look, it's this way.
[72:55.94]But I wasn't even looking.
[73:01.81]Down here?
[73:02.55]He didn't pay any attention?
[73:09.13]No, zero.
[73:09.57]Like, absolutely, just as close to zero as you can get.
[73:13.43]Down here?
[73:16.82]What?
[73:17.52]Why?
[73:18.36]Damn good question.
[73:19.80]I just heard a recording that confirmed she tipped him off.
[73:23.21]But Captain, then where is Langdon now?
[73:26.59]Have any fire alarms gone off there?
[73:28.93]No, sir.
[73:29.98]Okay.
[73:30.64]Langdon must still be inside the grad gallery.
[73:33.36]Inside?
[73:33.92]But what is he doing?
[73:35.62]Are you armed?
[73:36.93]Yes.
[73:37.95]What?
[74:27.90]This is my grandfather's office.
[74:29.82]Maybe we can find a clue here.
[74:34.42]This is... Standing there.
[74:36.83]Please pick up.
[74:38.21]This is Sister, Sun Tree, or Cecil Peace.
[74:40.13]They are all dead.
[74:42.47]The floor has been broken.
[74:44.23]The other three are dead.
[74:45.41]Please answer.
[74:46.90]Wait, what?
[74:47.64]That's you talking here, but you're standing here.
[74:52.34]How could you be in there and out here?
[74:59.16]Wait, that's not her talking?
[75:00.62]I thought that was... I thought she left a message and that's how they found out that I got the bug.
[75:04.24]How high are you?
[75:04.78]I'm not.
[75:05.12]Just relax.
[75:25.62]I'm not.
[75:26.02]I'm fine.
[75:26.76]I'm fine.
[75:27.51]I'm fine right now.
[75:28.83]I have not had any marijuana cigarettes at all.
[75:36.65]Robert, take a look at this.
[75:39.02]It's research on where all the fleur-de-lis are in the Louvre.
[75:43.18]I'm kidding around.
[75:44.48]It might be another clue to Saunière's involvement with the Priory of Sion.
[75:48.29]Or perhaps the Priory's involvement with the Louvre.
[75:52.85]Okay, so let's take a look.
[75:54.58]Interesting.
[75:54.98]Okay.
[76:15.45]And nothing else?
[76:16.43]Okay.
[76:16.73]What about what's on the computer?
[76:22.10]Special laptop used by police for crime scene investigation.
[76:25.04]Okay.
[76:28.02]Oh, wait a minute.
[76:28.76]Huh?
[76:43.76]so excited this map of the louvre it smells it smells like alcohol smells map of the louvre this map of the louvre smells like alcohol okay but it so what there's a phone on the map this map of the louvre this map has been drinking
[77:13.78]Okay, but so... Boring as fuck, just like the book.
[77:23.75]Come on!
[77:29.33]What do you mean all these trues, true, true, true?
[77:46.49]It's a novel.
[77:52.11]Boring as fuck.
[77:53.25]Book sucks.
[77:54.76]It's probably good, isn't it?
[77:56.48]Alright.
[78:00.44]So what's a good book?
[78:02.20]What's a good book?
[78:04.66]Can chat agree on some nominees for what a good book is?
[78:07.92]Okay, well, I don't know what else to do here.
[78:12.10]Smells like alcohol.
[78:18.23]Search the office.
[78:19.47]Yeah, I did.
[78:19.93]Can we get a poll up here?
[78:27.97]Okay, I see the Bible, Green Eggs and Ham, Dante's Inferno, and Dune.
[78:36.96]Alright, pick between those four.
[78:43.11]What's your favorite book?
[78:44.99]What's your favorite?
[78:45.71]Well, no.
[78:46.23]Don't put the Bible in there.
[78:48.99]No, those three.
[78:50.91]We don't need the Bible.
[78:55.92]Large bookshelf containing many books.
[79:01.24]It's probably like a... Right?
[79:03.02]No?
[79:07.09]No?
[79:15.79]The vent seems to connect to the adjacent room.
[79:19.12]Can we get up there?
[79:22.66]How do we get up there?
[79:31.02]How do we get up to the vent?
[79:32.61]Can we move a chair?
[79:33.21]Do I need a ladder?
[79:35.57]Bring a ladder back in here?
[79:37.75]How much of a point-and-click adventure game does this game want to be versus how much is it actually, right?
[79:42.61]Like, do I need to go get a ladder and bring it back into this room?
[80:03.37]UV light.
[80:07.27]okay alright alright so so it's it's okay so it's a I just didn't know I didn't know if it was like a go to your inventory like point click okay what's this what do we need to know okay wait he circled his office no look closer it is the room next door the restoration room there is a vent up above if you boost me up to it maybe I can get to the other side
[80:34.11]Oh, wait, yeah, we're doing a poll.
[80:35.91]What was the poll again?
[80:38.49]What's your favorite book?
[80:40.13]What's a book that you consider to read?
[80:42.09]I have to tap every time.
[80:58.12]What were the options?
[81:02.35]uh green eggs and ham you need to search around some more dune maybe we can find a clue here the bible and what was the other one I said there was a fourth one was it oh dante's inferno yeah okay there you go what do you do you like chemistry isn't my strong suit
[81:29.44]Oh, God.
[81:29.60]I can't even read this.
[81:31.18]I'm making a... We just chug it?
[81:33.27]Lactose?
[81:33.81]Okay, well, I don't know.
[81:37.03]We'll figure it out.
[81:37.45]What's this?
[82:00.80]best book of all time what do we got green eggs and ham dude it's so funny how dune is the lowest of all of these so green eggs and ham is just absolutely sweeping right now okay
[82:29.55]The Bible is in second.
[82:31.07]Best book of all time.
[82:36.12]Renaissance more important than the Bible.
[82:41.00]Bible way more important than Dune.
[82:43.78]Also, Bible more important than Dante's Inferno.
[82:47.18]Two religious books up here.
[82:49.12]Well, one of them is a religious book.
[82:50.92]The other one is a take on the religious text, right?
[82:55.68]How is Dante's Inferno not higher?
[82:58.08]Those books are terrible.
[83:02.11]Dante's Inferno, I remember reading Dante's Inferno and just being like, what's going on here?
[83:09.38]What the fuck?
[83:10.84]How many of you guys just haven't even read Dante's Inferno?
[83:20.32]Green Eggs and Ham, okay.
[83:22.86]Alright.
[83:27.71]Dante's Inferno, what was it?
[83:32.49]Dante's Inferno is a... Jeremiah, I haven't read any of these.
[83:37.67]What?
[83:40.00]You've never read Green Eggs and Ham?
[83:43.44]You had to.
[83:46.96]You've never read Green Eggs and... I think this might be the only one of the four that a lot of you have read.
[83:57.55]That's the one I know.
[83:58.39]Can I get a towel?
[84:01.75]Alright, we are way over our time limit on this one.

[84:19.42]Dirty painting with the towel?
[84:35.51]I cannot make out what the painting is supposed to depict.
[84:38.67]Maybe we can remove the dirt.
[84:41.27]They use the use it.
[84:45.55]Rinse it in the sink.

[85:33.18]Let me just get past this.
[85:39.15]Enzyme that functions in the defense against fungal and insect pathogens.
[85:43.73]Commonly used as a counter enzyme that neutralizes supercharged oxygen molecules.
[85:51.36]It neutralizes supercharged oxygen molecules called superoxide radicals.
[85:56.10]You don't want those on your counter.
[86:00.87]Pretty good cleaning.
[86:02.93]Evolved in the hydrolysis of lactose to constitute galactose and glucose.
[86:09.66]Its functions include catalyzing the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen.
[86:15.62]An enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia.
[86:22.93]I'm just going to pick two until I get it right.

[87:01.97]It kind of was toilet sounds.

[88:03.68]10 plus?
[88:07.22]Some of you mean that.
[88:08.02]Some of you are talking about like 20.
[88:11.28]My goal is always 100.
[88:12.52]10 is easy.
[88:15.44]Some people read a lot.
[88:17.28]That's a lot.
[88:18.14]How many books are you reading?
[88:19.02]10?

[88:47.87]At least out of the sample size that I chose to answer.
[88:50.15]I've only read under two books in a whole year.
[88:55.82]Sometimes less than one.
[88:59.12]The last time I've read a book was Game of Thrones.
[89:03.86]It was the Game of Thrones book.
[89:10.06]It has to be the last Game of Thrones book.
[89:15.47]What about audiobooks?
[89:19.02]I think those count.
[89:23.48]It's the only book you've read.
[89:27.04]Name ten books.
[89:31.71]That's not fair, though.
[89:33.67]That's actually not fair, because I don't pay attention to that world, really, at all.
[89:39.81]Name ten books.
[89:43.81]Dr. Seuss, Green Eggs and Ham.
[89:52.48]The Great Gatsby?

[90:48.81]That's six.
[91:07.55]tempest let me do it let me do it let me do it he's thinking so I'm just thinking about a relevant book that I may have even read or heard of the streets now the tempest um I mean like everything is a book I could just name anything
[91:36.99]Lord of the Rings?
[91:37.59]I mean, The Hobbit?

[91:59.33]That's not four.
[91:59.91]Four.
[92:08.58]Uh, you know what?
[92:09.12]I'm just gonna name a random movie.
[92:14.32]And I... My big fat Greek wedding?
[92:17.00]Is that a book?
[92:19.00]That's a book, right?
[92:19.70]That's a book.
[92:21.50]Right?
[92:24.13]That's a book?
[92:25.21]Was that a book first?
[92:27.83]In fact, I kind of feel like it was.
[92:29.47]Is it not?
[92:34.97]I'm thinking of like, okay, movies that like were books...
[92:39.33]Dune?
[92:39.63]Titanic?
[92:45.40]A screenplay is not a book.
[92:47.22]Technically, it was.
[92:48.04]James and the Giant Peach.
[92:52.35]How's that?
[92:55.85]That's been at least 10.
[93:03.07]The Titanic?
[93:03.75]No, somebody said that in chat and I said it out loud.
[93:06.53]I didn't say that.
[93:07.65]I was laughing at... No, the Titanic... Okay, I need to defend myself here.
[93:13.07]Somebody said the Titanic.
[93:14.39]Like, ten of you said it and I was reading the chat room.
[93:16.79]Going, the Titanic?
[93:17.79]Like, what the fuck?
[93:19.76]The Titanic was not a book first.
[93:22.76]Oh my god, you guys are... I'm being... You guys are attacking me.
[93:26.60]Play the game?
[93:29.12]Play the game?
[93:32.75]How many of you guys actually care about me playing the game?
[93:34.75]I thought it was like, don't play the game, play the other one.
[93:39.87]You cannot honestly believe that I thought the Titanic was a book before it was a horrific thing that happened in the world.
[93:47.29]What's going on?
[93:48.09]This isn't necessary.
[94:04.14]The book is actually what was based on the... Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[94:07.02]Hold on.
[94:07.38]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[94:08.12]We need to make sure that we get this clear here.
[94:11.02]The movie The Titanic was... Was it based off of a book of the telling of that story?
[94:23.31]So they just made that up.
[94:26.97]Okay, I just... We're just checking.
[94:28.99]It could be.
[94:32.90]The movie that... This isn't important.
[94:38.98]A lot of you know what I mean.
[94:40.72]Like, Titanic the movie, was it like a retelling of like a book version of the Titanic where those characters were in it?
[94:48.65]I don't think this is relevant.
[94:56.07]It's historical fiction.
[94:57.95]That's what I'm saying.
[94:58.83]Was there like a Titanic book?
[95:04.22]Alright, I'll play a different game.
[95:14.13]My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
[95:17.98]I don't know.
[95:18.36]I figured like maybe that's a, maybe it was a book.
[95:22.39]No, the Titanic is a real thing.
[95:24.87]Oh my God.
[95:25.79]How do I get out of this?
[95:27.21]How do I get out of this?
[95:27.89]How do I like, how do I get, how do I take the car and like slowly get off the exit and like get us off this highway?
[95:34.29]You know what I mean?
[95:34.75]Alright, the next one coming up is going to be in the same world, I think.
[95:53.32]There are Titanic books.
[95:57.43]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[95:59.11]We have a paragraph, Andy, here.
[96:05.76]The film based on the book and with advice from the Lord was released in 1958.
[96:13.74]Lord also served as a consultant to Canadian film director James Cameron while he was making the film Titanic.
[96:19.95]That is precisely what I'm talking about.
[96:22.13]That is precisely what I was talking about.
[96:24.19]I'm so glad we get to turn off the exit now.
[96:26.39]Yes, it was.
[96:27.27]Somebody wrote a book.
[96:30.49]You just got back on the highway.
[96:32.52]Somebody wrote a book based on this, and that's what the movie was based on.
[96:37.28]I, you know, I might say things completely fucked up sometimes, but you know what I mean.
[96:44.67]Come on, up next is stolen.
[97:00.11]based on the book with advice from lord was released in 1958. lord also served as consultant so so somebody wrote a book and then they consulted on the movie about titanic about like that happening okay like the the story that he wrote alright sounds good um I think the Xbox is wrong no not the lord did somebody write something named lord
[97:32.39]There we go.
[97:32.73]Okay, I thought the disc was broken or something.
[97:42.25]Everyone else disagrees with you and that guy.
[97:49.93]At least I got one person here that can help me.
[97:56.72]This game's called Stolen.
[98:01.69]No, I agree.
[98:02.41]I exist.
[98:03.07]I'm here.
[98:03.61]Oh, the Goofy movie was a book before it was a movie.
[98:51.49]Wait, what's happening?
[98:52.79]I feel like we're getting the whole movie spoiled by the trailer.
[99:18.96]Scorned.
[99:23.70]They're doing it.
[99:24.76]They're doing it.
[99:25.52]They're doing it.
[99:26.14]They're doing it.
[99:26.64]I get to... They're doing it.
[99:27.52]I need to calm down because they're doing it.
[99:38.22]Okay.
[99:38.54]I'm going to relax.
[99:39.10]I didn't want to do that.
[99:44.17]I don't... What the fuck did I just do?
[99:47.49]Why am I doing this right now?
[99:52.63]What's that?
[99:53.01]What am I doing?
[100:04.73]Silent.

[100:35.86]while the mayor's main rival, candidate Richard Killian, unveiled his anti-crime platform in a televised address.
[100:43.62]For years, crime thrived under Morgan's reign.
[100:47.67]But no more.
[100:48.99]For years, they called us the city of sin.

[101:01.69]It's cold.
[101:02.83]It's dirty.
[101:04.39]It's home to far more sinners than saints.

[122:10.98]It's just like... I'm just like...
[122:36.63]What does that mean?
[122:38.09]I don't do this!
[122:39.11]I'm just using a phrase!
[122:43.39]Stop moaning?
[122:44.95]I'm gonna do whatever I want.
[122:52.93]Where is this guy?
[122:53.69]Okay.
[122:59.28]Press A to select a hacking target.
[123:00.50]Use the left thumbstick to copy the computer sequence.
[123:03.90]Right thumbstick, L and R control the camera.
[123:08.34]Jerma, you're a brat.
[123:09.02]What's going on?
[123:09.52]What was- what happened?
[123:10.82]How did I fail to hack?
[123:57.05]Do I even need the key anymore?
[123:58.15]I don't need the key.
[124:42.16]We're good.
[124:42.53]Everything's fine.
[125:41.68]What?!
[125:42.22]Dude, this guy's f***ing final boss!
[126:13.78]Alright, steal.
[126:15.76]Steal.
[126:29.11]Oh my god, the analog just fucked me up, guys.
[126:32.61]The analog went like... Oh, fuck.
[126:37.56]Oh.
[126:57.32]Oh, come on.
[126:58.34]Get away from me.
[126:59.52]Give me a break.
[127:00.34]Turn around.
[127:07.37]Don't point the flashlight on me.
[127:09.42]Fuck!
[127:29.72]I'm so fucked up, I promise.
[127:31.80]It's such a weird game to play.
[127:51.66]Shoot him!
[127:52.88]Shoot!
[128:26.29]Okay, now what?
[128:27.19]Get out!
[128:34.33]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[128:42.18]Yes!
[128:42.76]I'm good.
[129:02.03]I kind of like this game.
[129:03.11]It's fun.
[129:05.80]The night vision mode looks like you're inside of a Mountain Dew bottle.
[129:13.39]True.
[129:29.63]I like those glasses though.
[129:31.67]Those glasses are awesome.
[129:33.23]I missed that.
[129:34.23]What did he say?
[129:35.09]He said that uses something.
[129:36.37]We'll lose something about a lock.
[129:59.30]Kill the power.
[130:11.21]What does it want me to do?
[130:19.69]I wasn't paying attention either.
[130:21.03]See, I'm not the only one.
[130:22.27]Okay, hold on.
[130:29.47]Should I go in the middle here?
[130:32.37]You said it out loud, but I didn't comprehend it.
[130:43.82]It was like something about using the light to see where I can go or something.
[130:49.04]Something to do with my, maybe an emitter?
[130:53.78]Turn power off.
[131:00.09]I don't know how to do that, though.
[131:11.02]Destroy the electricity?
[131:14.84]Anya, I'm picking up some electromagnetic frequencies.
[131:18.47]When you get near to systems that emit EM radiation like this.
[131:22.57]How am I supposed to do this?
[131:24.67]Louis, you're full of surprises.
[131:30.08]Can I just walk through this?
[131:30.96]Like, who cares?
[131:35.56]It is not an alarm.
[131:37.38]It's a Tesla coil.
[131:39.23]I thought it was an alarm system.
[131:41.49]It's not an alarm.
[131:43.79]This shit zaps you.
[131:48.85]Okay.
[131:50.51]So now I need a different solution than this.
[131:54.25]So I need to shoot something that's emitting this.
[131:57.86]And I should have listened to the guy talking!
[132:32.34]Oh, this is gonna suck.
[132:33.83]I'm so dead.
[132:44.17]Get up.
[132:46.51]I can't get up from here?
[132:50.42]Yeah.
[132:53.94]Oh my god.
[132:54.74]Okay, I get it.
[133:16.89]Yup.
[133:19.89]What are you... What?
[133:24.32]What was that?
[133:25.24]Why did that just... I didn't press... I did not press A. I didn't even press A. I didn't even jump.
[133:31.18]That was weird.
[134:16.38]Got it.
[134:21.15]That's it powers down.
[134:23.59]It's a lot of trouble just for one door.
[134:26.23]We use the Xbox now.
[134:28.09]Next time.
[134:28.77]Or you should put matching shades on.
[134:32.37]I can't just jump over the fence.
[134:45.61]That seems kind of... There's no way, right?
[134:47.59]Like, look at this.
[134:48.29]It wants me to go, like, boink, up.
[134:52.17]There's not a chance it does not want me to do that.
[135:03.42]Hey, Tony, we just lost the lights.
[135:05.98]What are you doing down there?
[135:09.46]Okay, I'll send a couple of the guys down to check it out.
[135:18.17]Do something funny?
[135:19.39]Nah, I don't feel like it.
[135:39.51]Are there more than two people here?
[135:44.72]There are.
[135:45.00]Okay, there's one down there and one over here.
[136:10.27]Get out of fucking... I'm done with this game.
[136:12.69]I'm done with it.
[136:13.77]I'm done.
[136:14.17]I'm done.
[136:14.43]I don't play this one anymore.
[136:15.37]I'm done playing this one.
[136:16.25]This one was fun for a few minutes.
[136:18.93]We're going to put on this one.
[136:25.84]Death Row Underground Team Combat.
[136:31.78]That was fun for a minute.
[136:37.94]I'm seeing some pogs on this one.
[136:39.19]Is this a good one?
[136:43.45]Can you do a piss break?
[136:45.07]Do you guys need a piss break?
[136:46.09]Do you guys good?
[136:46.51]Piss break, what do you think?
[136:51.73]Yeah, maybe?
[136:53.33]You guys need a piss break?
[136:57.46]Yeah?
[136:58.86]No?
[137:00.18]Alright, fine, we'll do it.
[137:01.40]It's been a few hours.
[137:02.18]It's been like two and a half hours, right?
[137:03.34]Yeah.
[137:04.65]Alright, we'll take a quick break.
[137:05.71]I'll be right back.
[137:06.63]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[137:07.83]We'll come back with Death Row.
[137:09.45]A fighting game or something?
[137:12.36]I'll be right back.
[137:50.07]Thank you.
[139:10.09]Thanks for watching!
[140:42.62]Thank you.
[141:52.61]Thank you.
[142:21.88]I have returned back.
[142:25.12]Hello.
[142:27.76]How's it going?
[142:29.34]Hi.
[142:31.88]Okay.
[142:32.14]Here it is.
[142:32.44]Uh, here you go.
[142:34.81]Let's see.
[142:37.01]Alright.
[142:38.19]Do you hear it?
[142:39.33]Good.
[142:40.79]Okay, this is not what I thought it was going to be.
[142:44.85]Not even close.
[142:46.75]I thought this was going to be a game where you fight.
[142:49.09]It's like a big brawl, underground fighting.
[142:51.89]I think it's a sport.
[142:58.39]It's some kind of sport.
[142:59.83]It's like basketball, but with a disc or something.
[143:07.22]Can we do sports view?
[143:08.30]It's probably sports view, right?
[143:22.03]The droids versus the blitzers.
[143:27.93]How do you play?
[143:34.43]Is my lineup?
[143:35.89]Oh, definitely Blitz Andy.
[143:54.07]versus the training droids.
[144:58.66]Did I- did we get a point?
[145:01.41]What?
[145:01.69]Okay, where's the disc?
[145:07.11]I just injured the droid.
[145:25.72]Pass it, pass it, pass it, pass it, pass it!
[145:28.48]Pass it over here!
[145:30.44]Pass it!
[145:35.50]Okay.
[145:49.37]OH!
[145:49.59]This is actually kinda cool!
[146:10.50]Alright, where's the disc?
[146:26.04]Let's go!
[146:35.00]R to locate the disc.
[146:35.90]Isn't that what I'm pressing?
[146:52.89]We're running by three points.
[147:13.58]Alright, we win.
[147:20.24]Replay the round.
[147:31.16]That counts as two points?
[147:33.64]I threw it behind.
[147:44.54]Oh, that's when I was just injuring people.
[147:46.12]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[147:50.84]I get it, I get it.
[147:51.60]Alright, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[147:55.22]I get it, I get it.
[147:55.92]We don't need to do it again.
[147:59.06]game stinks I don't think it does the crowd sounds like a vacuum alright single match conquest okay conquest the blitzers no rules
[148:28.82]Oh, these are the teams.
[148:29.82]The sea cats, the protectors, the convicts.
[148:37.42]There are four teams in this league.
[148:44.40]Who has the highest punch percentage?
[148:52.04]Okay, it's convicts.
[149:02.05]Okay.
[149:27.29]Okay, we've got Alvarez, Zeke, Becker, and Toro.
[149:42.85]I don't think this really matters.
[149:43.81]I'm going to challenge the Blitzers.
[150:07.50]Is somebody behind you?
[150:16.07]Where?
[150:18.09]Where is he?
[150:20.67]Oh, there you are.
[150:23.77]You want to leave?
[150:26.27]He's lying down over here.
[150:28.23]You want to leave?
[150:32.86]You want to leave?
[150:35.02]You want to get out of here?
[150:36.57]Alright, let's go.
[150:38.29]Give me one sec.
[151:01.75]Show Otto?
[151:02.69]Oh, okay.
[151:04.09]He's gotta get in the right spot.
[151:05.17]Otto, go over here.
[151:06.43]Come over here.
[151:06.73]Let's go.
[151:07.69]Go over that way.
[151:09.25]Go over so they can see you.
[151:09.99]Hey, Joe.
[151:17.37]Hey.
[151:17.49]Look up here.
[151:20.05]Oh, you can kind of see his butt.
[151:24.73]What's up?
[151:25.95]You want to get out of here?
[151:26.61]Okay.
[151:26.89]Alright.
[151:27.67]We're back.
[151:30.75]Let's go.
[151:32.71]Excited dog.
[151:34.09]Cartoon.
[151:36.66]Let's go.
[154:16.89]Okay, he's good.
[154:21.51]I took that one out.
[154:23.01]I think we saw all we needed to see.
[154:34.11]What did I do?
[154:37.56]What?
[154:42.60]What's wrong?
[154:44.86]Discord is down?
[154:46.42]Oh, I don't know.
[154:50.10]Check the... I don't know.
[154:51.10]I don't... Alright, we're putting in... I feel like we're going to be in this one for at least half hour.
[155:03.51]Maybe not, though.
[155:04.85]This is Eragon?
[155:06.38]That movie with the dragons?
[155:10.00]Eragon?
[155:10.70]Eragon?
[155:11.18]Eragon?
[155:11.74]Eragon?
[155:12.98]Eragon?
[155:13.76]Eragon?
[155:14.36]Eragon?
[155:17.63]Eragon.
[155:19.73]Yo, this game.
[155:29.10]People are excited about this one.
[155:30.16]Okay, let's see it.
[155:43.87]I'm not hearing it.
[155:47.81]Why can I not hear this?
[155:49.39]I don't hear anything.
[156:13.90]Why can you?
[156:14.56]That's weird.
[156:26.40]Okay, now I can.
[156:27.72]Was the cord loose?
[156:29.71]Alright, Eragon!
[156:34.43]Never saw this movie.
[156:40.05]Haven't seen this movie.
[156:47.72]It was a book?
[156:50.46]When the kingdom of Alegasia flourished, a time without tyranny or fear.
[156:56.63]When dragon riders feel disguise,
[157:00.09]But that time has long passed, and the ruthless Galvatrix now rules the land.
[157:06.46]Hmm.
[157:07.98]And Durza, a wicked shade, enforces Galvatrix's iron rule.
[157:15.12]But the reach of despots is limited, and even Galvatrix couldn't touch one unsuspecting farm boy.
[157:22.19]A boy whose heart burned with hope.
[157:24.27]Like old film?
[157:25.73]What is this old film?
[157:31.37]A little closer in your mind.
[157:38.19]OK.
[158:02.49]Oh my god, that was loud.
[158:03.43]Those combos.
[158:08.30]It's never easy.
[158:31.76]That was all of my left ear.
[158:34.08]This game is awesome.
[158:37.07]Is it?
[158:37.31]I thought that was her screaming.
[159:02.92]useless feels like we're watching a mobile game ad come back here
[159:32.71]If I jump, I could just reach that ledge.
[159:40.47]Okay.
[159:45.41]I can't jump this far.
[159:46.47]Jump and grab the rock ledge, then use L to move across.
[159:49.93]Got it.
[159:50.97]Now, just make my way over the gap.
[159:53.47]Okay.
[160:01.94]Hold and hold R to draw your bow.
[160:08.27]You can target by moving R and fire.
[160:41.06]It's so cool that he's using his camcorder to record this.
[160:47.06]Dude, this is what video games looked like back in like 2005, 2003.
[160:49.90]The stones.
[160:50.32]The stones.
[161:04.05]No, the game looked like shit back then too.
[161:05.81]Did it?
[161:06.27]Oh yeah, there's dragons in this.
[161:39.90]okay power orbs I didn't find the secret egg I feel like I need to shake and then pop off at the end eridan eventually discovered that what he found in the spine was not a simple stone but an egg an egg containing a small blue dragon
[162:11.05]Why is this pacing so cracked?
[162:40.15]Carver Hall.
[162:41.26]I think it's just.
[162:44.38]It's hard to make a cut scene.
[162:46.02]Especially back here in the day, it's like hard.
[162:51.95]You know how many hoops and strings that they had to pull through to just to make any of this look like anything you care about?
[162:58.76]There's so many tricks to make it even look like this.
[163:03.50]How he betrayed and murdered the dragon riders of old.
[163:07.58]But such talk was treason in a land ruled with fear.
[163:16.32]Do I get to fly a dragon?
[163:17.10]Am I cutting their heads off?
[163:51.40]Use grapple combo, grab stun for a few.
[164:02.24]My body wants to sneeze so bad, but I just can't.
[164:27.54]This game's pretty cool.
[164:28.50]Oh my god!
[164:31.99]How do I aim?
[165:07.57]You figured out the strategy.
[165:10.67]This is a tower defense game now.
[165:16.63]I think I'm probably going to need some cannon towers in a minute.
[165:18.93]After the next round.
[165:22.03]Probably two cannon towers in the front.
[165:30.44]Fury mode?
[165:31.14]L and R.
[165:37.52]Come on.
[165:38.86]L and R?
[165:39.92]Sticks?
[166:02.06]The Razak.
[166:03.84]Dares as devils.
[166:05.54]Hurry, or they'll kill us both.
[166:10.63]What's in it?
[166:17.14]Health orb?
[166:19.76]No.
[166:20.00]You have to put money or items, weapons, jewels, something like that.
[166:23.91]It better not be a health orb.
[166:28.35]Okay.
[166:28.45]Okay.
[166:42.80]It's loud.
[166:45.24]That was it!
[166:46.20]That was the start of it!
[166:47.50]That was- That was actually the start of it.
[166:52.20]It's just slowed down.
[167:57.94]Right now, there's somebody that was like, oh, dude, Aragorn again.
[168:01.12]This is my childhood.
[168:02.40]And they're watching this right now.
[168:04.44]They're going.
[168:04.86]No, it gets better.
[168:10.97]Wait till the dragon shows up.
[168:13.09]Wait till the dragon shows up.
[168:24.84]That is a bloody sword.
[168:26.33]Wait, shooting at the...
[168:59.77]That was awful.
[169:01.89]Okay, get close and then use your kill move.
[169:04.19]Oh my god.
[169:11.99]Who are these people that were doing this?
[169:13.86]Why are we attacking these?
[169:14.68]What's the point here?
[169:20.26]Do we do fury?
[169:21.76]Fury mode!
[170:09.04]Play Rats 2?
[170:09.64]I already did.
[170:13.54]Yeah, it's called Aragon.
[170:16.76]What happened?
[170:17.16]I just skipped.
[170:17.60]Wait, we just... What happened?
[170:18.42]I missed the cutscene.
[170:34.17]Stop getting so close.
[170:37.95]Oh, my God.
[170:38.63]I'm just trying to get out of here.
[171:10.62]Alright, let's go.
[171:12.14]Let's go.
[171:13.06]Alright, let's go.
[171:20.35]Let's do a little.
[171:22.83]No, we have to get to the dragon part.
[171:24.51]I'm not stopping this till the dragon's here.
[171:27.97]Braum and Aragorn returned too late to save Aragorn's uncle Garo.
[171:33.28]And realizing that a new dragon rider had been chosen, Braum led the distraught Aragorn to safety.
[171:51.71]Saving game.
[171:52.61]Alright, good.
[172:00.28]Cool.
[172:03.26]Braum has been given Aragorn, an old sword.
[172:05.92]Your attacks are now stronger.
[172:07.48]Do your best Stuart Little impression.
[172:16.45]Well, I think that it's going to be a really fun day today.
[172:20.09]I have no idea.
[172:20.91]I've never seen it.
[172:21.65]I've never heard him talk once.
[172:22.63]He said that was the Joker.
[172:41.62]Can we start breathing fire at people?
[172:50.37]sanctuary of the varden braum taught aragon the ways of a dragon rider I do appreciate we're getting there quickly the king's forces were lying in wait
[173:18.87]Everything is the Joker, Alex Jones, or Mr. Satan.
[173:22.84]Or Trump.
[173:23.64]How are there too many?

[220:23.42]What's a break?
[220:23.88]What's a break?
[220:28.71]Every... I was sandwiched.
[220:30.21]There was somebody on the left.
[220:31.09]There was somebody on the right.
[220:31.83]There was somebody behind me.
[220:32.65]They were all sandwiching, stabbing me.
[220:47.24]No!
[221:12.71]But I just threw lightning?
[221:14.21]Is this it?
[221:27.08]I think I just did it.
[221:50.64]It's over Not yet
[222:13.99]Alright, I have a lightning bolt.
[222:15.43]I don't know what it does, but I'm gonna hold it to the very end.
[222:22.93]Okay, alright, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!
[222:29.90]Where is it?
[222:59.79]This car sucks so bad.
[223:19.89]Why?
[223:20.55]When does the race end?
[223:22.01]I feel like I'm on like lap six.
[225:04.89]Arcade race?
[225:06.45]Wait.
[225:08.78]Oh, no, that's just what it's called.
[225:10.72]Career.
[225:11.60]I mean, no, I'm not doing a career.
[225:18.13]That was fun.
[225:19.07]That was worth, for sure, that was worth playing.
[225:22.02]Alright, it's time for you guys to take a vote here.
[225:24.00]Are we going to play Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb?
[225:28.47]Or... Driver Parallel Lines.
[225:37.11]What do you think?
[225:50.11]I'm seeing a lot of both, though.
[225:52.20]Let's see.
[225:53.74]Indiana Jones or Driver Parallel Lines.
[225:59.26]Ooh, this actually, there's a lot of people that want both.
[226:09.28]You've played the Driver game already on stream.
[226:18.23]What?
[226:23.26]Jerma plays driver parallel lines no I didn't I didn't it'd be a different driver game I think this one's only on the original Xbox I don't think this one's uh backwards compatible alright what are we doing
[226:51.41]Pretty close, but we're doing driver parallel lines.
[226:54.01]We'll do Indiana Jones after that.
[226:57.25]Well, we'll see.
[226:58.51]Alright, driver coming up.
[227:02.99]No burning.
[227:07.57]Driver 4 is parallel lines.
[227:22.52]Wait, driver is parallel lines.
[227:27.21]You play driver or I play driver one.
[227:29.13]I didn't play the anyone the other ones.
[227:33.77]We'll see whatever it is.
[227:35.77]I don't know.
[227:38.27]Tell me I've played this before.
[227:41.17]I don't believe you.
[227:41.75]What do you say?
[227:49.50]You Googled yourself.
[227:51.60]I'm Googling to see if there's a video of it.
[227:53.78]Guys, I've played thousands of video games.
[227:59.62]And I've made thousands of videos over the course of 13 years, 12, 13 years.
[228:05.64]I've streamed millions of different pieces of frames have gone into my brain.
[228:10.34]I don't remember.
[228:12.15]Maybe, I mean, yeah, there's like seven of these games.
[228:15.05]Maybe I played one of them.
[228:17.07]I don't know.
[228:19.60]Do you know how many frames have gone in here?
[228:21.46]How many actual animation frames have gone into my head?
[228:37.51]Driver- so the- wait, driver parallel fa- fa- fa- driver parallel four is what I just said.
[228:43.26]Driver parallel lines is just driver four.
[228:46.78]Well that- how come it didn't say that on the box?
[229:01.19]I don't think it is.
[229:26.34]right I remember this okay I heard I remember this now one way or enough
[229:55.05]One day you may be next to me.
[230:30.08]Liquor stores, huh?
[230:31.48]That mean you're on your way up or your way down?
[230:57.57]I've already played this.
[230:58.13]So we're gonna do Indiana Jones.
[231:06.92]I've already played it.
[231:17.73]So wait, so Driver 4, I just, maybe I thought, oh, I played Driver 4 because the name of the video is Driver 4.
[231:25.35]when I was like oh driver parallel lines that's a different spin-off driver game that I've never played before just put up a gameplay video and react to it alright Indiana Jones for the Xbox
[232:15.42]Adventure has a name.
[232:16.33]Somebody asked in the mod chat, is he okay?
[232:24.51]Guys, I've seen hundreds of billions of frames.
[232:29.90]The amount of data that's been from this screen put into here and me streaming it.
[232:35.52]I've played, does anyone want to count the amount of games I've played on stream or on YouTube?
[232:40.71]It has to be at least like two or three thousand.
[232:43.66]It has to be thousands of them.
[232:45.38]At least two or three thousand.
[232:51.81]Is it going to get DMCA'd too?
[232:52.97]Just say you forgot, like a normal person.
[233:00.65]I did.
[233:01.97]And I'm just explaining... Alright, we good?
[233:09.58]Let's go.
[233:12.22]You are obliterated right now.
[233:20.35]Alright, is it Harrison Ford?
[233:41.57]I should be that same guy that did Tom Hanks.
[233:44.75]That'd be great.
[234:18.00]I played this growing up.
[234:18.83]It kind of sucks.
[234:20.17]Pretty good.
[234:49.04]You gotta check.
[234:56.22]This guy has three acting credits.
[234:58.17]They're all Harrison Ford.
[235:04.55]Doing a pretty damn good job.
[235:29.29]so many of these games would just ledge grab andes you know what I mean like it's oh grab the ledge and pull yourself up the ledge okay let me say he's so tired already no I'm I'm not tired right now I'm what do you mean he's so tired
[236:04.57]Can I press something?
[236:21.44]Can you drink it?
[236:34.93]Why does it smell bad?
[236:36.17]He's like... There's going to be an awesome cat puke here.
[236:41.19]Be ready to clip it.
[236:42.25]Be ready to clip this cat puke because you know it's coming.
[236:48.51]How do I use that?
[237:16.24]How do I use this machete?
[238:10.56]You don't have one.
[238:16.41]But didn't he say, I'm going to use my machete?
[238:20.41]Didn't he say, I'm going to use my machete?
[238:22.21]Or did he say, I need to use a machete?
[238:34.70]Okay.
[238:37.58]Let me do that.
[238:42.44]Every game had this shit.
[238:46.66]Even Super Mario.
[238:55.88]That's punch, not jump.
[238:58.25]B is jump.
[239:20.31]Thank God.
[239:20.83]Machete!
[239:29.73]Okay.
[239:46.72]That's actually really good to know.
[240:04.88]Good thing I brought my whip.
[240:40.83]That looked dangerous.
[240:44.98]This is so boring now because I'm now aware of how long the ledge climbing is.
[240:48.32]Thanks.
[240:51.66]This game looks incredibly boring.
[240:53.97]Not really.
[240:54.91]It's just a game.
[240:55.89]It's just a video game.
[241:00.51]There's a jump.
[241:01.59]There's a run.
[241:02.13]There's a slash.
[241:10.07]We want driver.
[241:11.01]We want driver parallel lines.
[241:12.73]We want driver parallel lines.
[241:14.49]Ivory hunters.
[241:15.89]These guys are no Boy Scouts.
[241:17.74]I better watch my back.
[241:28.99]According to the Jerma video, ran at 4,800 hours of video.
[241:35.61]Okay, so 4,809 hours of video with the assumption that he's running at 60 hertz.
[241:41.71]Jerma has personally viewed over 1,000,000.
[241:44.56]Is it billion?
[241:45.74]That's 1,000,000,000 individual frames.
[241:47.24]If it was 144 hertz, it would be 2.4 billion individual frames.
[241:50.70]Damn.
[242:09.32]And that's what just makes it into videos.
[242:11.36]Right.
[242:13.53]And he can't remember the last 100.
[242:14.87]Wait till you get older.
[242:21.59]You'll see.
[242:22.97]Wait till you get older.
[242:25.97]Wait till you get a little older.
[242:29.27]You'll see.
[242:37.16]You're not going to remember.
[242:38.56]Yeah, guys, sorry.
[242:39.46]I mean, I remember kind of playing Spelunky when it came out, but I forgot that until I just thought about it.
[243:00.60]I already have... Yeah, my memory is already bad.
[243:02.62]Can I sneak?
[243:04.40]Okay.
[243:20.19]Hmm.
[243:42.93]How do I beat it?
[243:43.63]Am I just gonna get it?
[243:50.66]Get out of the menu, dude.
[244:01.68]Alright, sounds good.
[244:09.91]Who made this game?
[244:16.23]Hey, it's me, the American!
[244:21.96]Everything you heard is true!
[244:39.87]The fire killed me.
[244:47.10]What the fuck is this garbage?
[244:56.14]Alright, one last try.
[244:57.40]One last try.
[245:09.53]Guys, they made the DaVinci Code.
[245:13.01]Same company.
[245:15.01]Have I played all their games today?
[245:21.26]They made Men in Black the Game, Star Trek Deep Space Nine, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Indiana Jones, Wrath Unleashed, Star Wars Episode III, Mark Echo's Getting Up, The Da Vinci Code, and then... a cancelled game called Dirty Harry?
[245:47.71]Interesting.
[245:52.25]Interesting.
[245:53.11]Okay.
[245:53.55]Very cool.
[246:23.10]There he is.
[246:38.43]How do I reload the gun?
[246:50.55]He's over here!
[247:01.88]Alright, the game just got way better.
[247:02.90]Cause I can- I get a chair.
[247:13.39]Uh, what is this?
[247:14.21]Can I dig?
[247:40.86]Just try to do that It's doing that music it's doing the Star Wars type music I
[248:08.00]And one that goes... And it is... the best.
[248:34.76]Huh?
[248:45.98]Press Y?
[248:48.01]I'm pressing Y. Okay.
[248:50.29]I get to... It didn't do that last time.
[249:12.10]We're good.
[249:25.17]I remember this game on PS2, it sucks balls.
[249:28.45]That's such a ridiculous term.
[249:38.16]Like, oh, this dude, oh, I played this before, dude, this thing sucks balls.
[249:51.14]Okay.
[249:52.66]Uh, from here, where am I going?
[249:59.85]Oh, this thing sucks ass.
[250:01.45]It's like, what?
[250:20.08]This is uncomfortable, like how weird this is.
[251:00.72]That wasn't even good.
[251:11.89]That wasn't even good.
[251:14.57]Alright, so what am I doing here?
[251:32.68]Oh.
[251:33.72]What's going on here?
[251:41.05]Up there?
[251:41.41]I don't know what to do.
[252:14.14]Wait, where am I going?
[252:15.06]You just... That guy fucking ruined every... Get out of here.
[252:44.11]I'm going to rip the disc out.
[252:45.45]I'm just going to pull the disc out.
[252:47.09]I'm going to pull out the disc.
[252:48.01]I'm just going to take out the disc.
[252:54.25]I'm going to move on to another game.
[252:57.53]I'm going to take out the disc.
[253:03.50]One more second.
[253:04.08]I'm going to give it ten seconds.
[253:05.36]Ten.
[253:11.14]Nine.
[253:13.10]Eight.
[253:14.78]Seven.
[253:16.94]Six.
[253:19.26]Five.
[253:22.54]Four.
[253:26.18]Three.
[253:30.82]Two.
[253:36.47]Oh, come on.
[253:37.73]Where's the water?
[253:41.43]One and a half.
[253:44.11]One and three quarters.
[253:50.05]Two.
[253:51.85]Two and a half.
[253:54.28]Two and three quarters.
[253:55.76]Three.
[253:59.00]Three and a half.
[254:07.06]Four and a half.
[254:10.63]Alright, let's try it again.
[254:37.24]Alright, we're good.
[254:55.31]Gun.
[254:55.99]Gun.
[255:04.19]What do I do with this?
[255:07.56]Down there?
[255:09.90]I don't know.
[255:17.59]Um, over here?
[255:18.47]Okay.
[255:54.53]Jerma, please put it down.
[255:55.58]I will in a second.
[255:59.72]Alright, let's get a new pull-up.
[256:00.90]Do you want to see... Brute Force or... What the hell is this?
[256:25.54]Blood Omen 2.
[256:26.16]That's it.
[256:41.59]Brute Force or Blood Omen 2.
[256:44.01]What about the Fellowship of the Ring?
[256:45.37]I beat the first level of that.
[256:46.41]I don't have to play it ever again.
[256:49.98]Tell us what those are.
[256:50.80]I don't know.
[256:52.24]I don't know what they are.
[256:55.00]This one says, dangerous alone, deadly together.
[256:57.22]And the other one says... The other one says... The legacy of Cain.
[257:16.03]Which one?
[257:18.99]That was fun.
[257:19.61]It just wasn't very good.
[257:21.57]It was alright.
[257:22.87]If I was a huge fan of Indiana Jones, I would make sure I had that, like, just round out my whole collection.
[257:26.83]Alright, Brute Force or Blood Omen 2.
[257:35.16]Why do I feel like I've played one of these before somehow?
[257:45.77]Legacy of Kain.
[257:46.75]I feel like I probably played it a long time ago.
[257:57.25]I like the Xbox pause screen.
[257:58.69]Yeah, I do too.
[257:59.71]I just want to make sure it's not here for that long because it burns into my screen.
[258:06.00]Legacy of Kain is real shit.
[258:07.86]Okay.
[258:09.26]Well.
[258:11.62]I think that's what you're voting for, so we're going to play it.
[258:15.75]Legacy of Kain.
[258:17.03]Blood Omen 2.
[258:17.67]There's so much junk here.
[258:23.79]You don't even want to know.
[258:26.43]Alright.
[258:27.26]Let's try it.
[258:36.66]Soul Reaver on PS1 was really cool.
[258:38.32]I feel like I remember that game.
[258:46.33]Is this stuff still burned in from the first day?
[258:48.17]No, thankfully it... Turning the monitor off for a day or two helps it.
[258:52.56]Fixes it.
[258:53.06]I don't see anything there.
[258:58.68]Yikes.
[259:00.78]Okay, sorry.
[259:05.01]So glad I turned that down because that was awful for me.
[259:17.53]Crystal Dynamics?
[259:20.18]Look at all these game studios that we all know.
[259:24.56]Crystal Dynamics made this? ...
[259:50.27]This is Blood Omen 2, so we're jumping in like the third or fourth sequel of the game at this point.
[259:55.33]Sorry if we don't know what's going on.
[260:05.37]They made the Avengers game?
[260:17.86]This is on Steam.
[260:19.44]Is it really?
[260:19.96]Shit, cool.
[260:42.22]You shouldn't be playing it.
[260:44.62]I can't.
[260:45.40]I'm being speech jammed.
[260:46.36]I can't even hear myself think.
[260:51.21]Somebody said, you shouldn't... You shouldn't be playing it.
[260:57.75]If it's on PC.
[260:58.71]Yeah, but I mean, I already put the disc in.
[261:10.82]Ooh.
[261:14.60]Alright.
[261:16.47]Very cool.
[261:17.17]Let's go.
[261:17.65]Am I gonna get, like, obsessed with this game?
[261:27.91]Yeah, vibration on.
[261:28.91]Let's go.
[261:31.42]Am I?
[261:31.64]Pull and hold left trigger to block attacks.
[261:35.26]Tap left trigger as each enemy attack starts.
[261:39.38]I mean, I feel like... Okay.
[261:48.25]Um... It's a cat puke menu?
[261:53.97]Maybe a little.
[261:55.42]What's more fun?
[262:02.30]I'll try the fun one.
[262:05.04]Yeah, PC ports of old console games usually are awful.
[262:09.14]And the developer has not updated this for anything past like Windows 7 or something.
[262:13.63]So it's still a huge pain in the ass to actually get.
[262:15.29]And that'd be the problem.
[262:16.03]This might be bugs.
[262:17.03]Original hardware.
[262:33.97]Chapter one, the slums.
[262:35.57]Welcome to Meridian.
[262:47.43]It looks kind of crunchy.
[262:50.04]It looks kind of crunchy.
[263:01.14]Do not be afraid.
[263:07.85]Kane!
[263:11.93]I could do it really good, but I need the headphones out.
[263:13.83]You want me to do a good one?
[263:16.35]Should I do a good one?
[263:20.90]Can I get a poll to see if I should do a good one?
[263:22.34]Yes or no?
[263:22.72]Do you want me to do an all-in pallbearer?
[263:26.36]Yes or no?
[263:34.26]Now, proceed down this street.
[263:38.04]I shall be waiting.
[263:53.07]It's a checkpoint.
[263:56.67]Please, don't hurt me.
[264:08.60]Why so many?
[264:15.44]Welcome to the slums, Kane.
[264:17.82]We are in the oldest and most decrepit part of the city, where few people dare to come.
[264:23.71]A perfect place to train.
[264:25.97]Train me?
[264:27.31]You take me for a dog?
[264:28.91]Your memory has been shattered, and your body has lain dormant for two hundred years.
[264:34.28]What skills you had must be recovered before you can be of any use to the Cabal.
[264:39.64]You must learn to fight and to survive.
[264:42.04]I thought you were taking me to feed.
[264:44.57]Patience, vampire.
[264:46.97]First, know that you are stronger and faster than mortal men.
[264:50.81]Oh, there we go.
[264:51.43]You are able to jump higher and farther than any human that ever lived.
[264:55.40]Wait, what is this?
[264:56.24]Paul Bearer or Paul Barely?
[264:57.92]Seek for a place to jump.
[264:59.84]Alright.
[265:00.26]Now, join me up here.
[265:04.71]85% right now.
[265:05.15]Here we go.
[265:05.85]I'm going to go away from the mic because it's probably going to be really, really, really annoying.
[265:10.89]I go like this.
[265:11.83]Yeah, I don't want to be super awful.
[265:13.11]I'm going to go away from the mic.
[265:15.35]I'm not going to be on camera either.
[265:23.29]Kane!
[265:24.27]Oh.
[265:25.74]Kane!
[265:26.46]Oh my god, I can't do it.

[265:39.96]I evened out at the end there.
[265:46.58]Actually evened out pretty well at the end.
[265:48.86]It was kind of rough at the beginning.
[265:51.24]Dude, you're scaring my dog.

[266:31.40]You just woke up my entire family?
[266:33.88]I was falling asleep at my desk.
[266:38.70]You voted for it!
[266:39.38]You voted for it!
[266:40.71]Well, there's only 1,300 votes.
[266:41.63]How many people are sleeping in this channel?
[266:43.85]1,300 votes.
[266:44.07]There are 18,000 people here.
[266:45.31]How many of you are sleeping?
[267:04.72]You're evil.
[267:06.15]I don't know how many people are asleep watching my stream.
[267:09.99]When I say, hey, guys, alright, you want me to do an all-in pallbearer, and I even have you vote for it, everybody's like, alright, here we go.
[267:15.77]I'm going to do it.
[267:16.75]Here comes an all-in pallbearer scream.
[267:19.01]I'm going to go for it.
[267:20.02]I'm sorry, but that's the way things are.
[267:46.84]Can you imagine sitting there sleeping?
[267:48.96]Just like...
[267:54.63]It's just like, what the fuck?
[267:56.37]And you don't even care what it is.
[267:58.56]You don't care what you're listening to.
[268:00.90]It's just, fuck whoever is doing this.
[268:03.70]Fuck you.
[268:04.80]Turn it off.
[268:05.56]And you just, I think we lost a thousand people right there.
[268:09.24]Like, it doesn't matter what it is.
[268:10.45]It's just like, I don't care what this is.
[268:12.31]Shut it the fuck up and turn it off.
[268:14.93]I hate whatever it is.
[268:17.27]I think that just happened.
[268:21.29]I said destroy him.
[268:22.31]Yes, I did.
[268:28.42]Okay, let's play.
[268:37.04]I can't believe 1,300 people just... What?
[268:42.56]Are you sleeping?
[268:45.20]Do a full send and destroy him.
[268:46.82]No!
[268:47.86]No, I'm not going to do that again.
[268:49.12]I set up the microphone away so it wouldn't be so awful.
[268:52.91]I did it for like five seconds or so.
[268:55.65]And we move on.
[268:58.75]I missed it.
[269:22.30]Hold on.
[269:22.86]Let me see how bad it really was.
[269:24.50]People are like, alright, move on, move on.
[269:25.90]We're good, we're good.
[269:26.60]I just need to see.
[269:28.08]How bad was it really?
[269:28.98]Was it really that bad?
[269:40.13]Somebody linked it.
[269:40.79]Let me listen.
[269:59.53]That wasn't even that bad.
[270:11.95]What was wrong with that?
[270:14.96]What was wrong with that?
[270:15.78]I mean, those two are stepping on a fucking squeaky toy too hard.
[270:29.22]That's not even that loud.
[270:36.49]That's not even that bad.
[270:38.41]You guys are all making it up.
[270:44.33]It wasn't loud.
[270:45.24]It was just bad.
[270:46.34]Oh.
[270:51.50]Let's play the game.
[270:57.94]Stop making us relive that.
[271:11.35]What is going on right now?
[271:14.49]You don't even know who that is?
[271:15.71]75% of you don't know who Paul Bearer is.
[271:21.35]So I was just... I just sounded like an absolute... What?
[271:27.71]Oh, okay.
[271:29.45]Now that makes a lot more sense as to why everyone's like, what's wrong with you?
[271:32.39]What movie is he from?
[271:33.81]Oh no.
[271:34.19]Oh no.
[271:34.45]It's this, it's this guy.
[271:35.72]You tell me if I came close.
[272:10.90]not bad yeah so I didn't wait how many of you guys really don't know that you don't know the reference
[272:18.24]Okay.
[272:19.48]Alright, I'm not fucking around anymore.
[272:20.84]I know like 5,000 people just left.
[272:23.18]They're probably never coming back.
[272:25.34]Because thanks a lot.
[272:26.68]Thanks a lot, guys.
[272:28.08]Thanks a lot.
[272:29.20]Now they're never coming back.
[272:40.45]Okay.
[272:44.95]Agnes is not going to believe me.
[273:01.27]X is pull the lever?
[273:05.99]I thought it was from Star Trek.
[273:09.09]When he goes... No, no, it's...
[273:57.31]One sec.
[274:24.14]Mod chat just linked this and I have to watch it.
[274:27.20]I'm sorry.
[274:28.36]If you're expecting a video game to be played right now, I do apologize.
[274:34.25]But we need to watch this.
[274:43.29]Watch party.
[274:50.33]I wish I could apologize to those people.
[275:09.12]That's not even close.
[275:11.24]You could... What?
[275:14.10]I don't want to win a... Win a freak.
[275:20.63]Win a freak.
[275:21.25]I'm already playing the Xbox right now.
[275:23.61]Alright.
[275:34.65]That was, I thought that was going to be like a deep fake.
[275:43.46]Ban that person that linked that.
[275:55.27]Okay.
[276:05.43]Alright, let's play the game.
[276:06.49]No more- I'm not gonna, like, scream anymore.
[276:08.83]To the person that came in here, like, four hours ago, Hey, dude, scream as loud as you can.
[276:12.21]I don't wanna do that.
[276:14.01]I just did it because, like, I thought- I thought, like, 15,000 people voted for it, but only 1,000 people did, and 17,000 people were sleeping.
[276:21.16]And I just screamed and made them wake up, and now they hate me.
[276:24.44]Great.
[276:25.00]This city is a labyrinth.
[276:27.00]All the better for a hunting ground.
[276:29.78]Tell me, Kane, are you hungry?
[276:35.49]I have a prisoner waiting for you down below.
[276:37.70]A thug from a local gang of criminals.
[276:42.16]He sought to murder yet another helpless victim, but he met me instead.
[276:47.10]That was a good video.
[276:50.76]I actually loved it.
[276:53.02]Drink then.
[276:54.76]I will be waiting below.
[276:59.94]there's definitely not guys 90 of the audience does not sleep in a dead to sleep during the stream it's probably like five percent it's not that many I see you are restored
[277:25.16]Without it, you will die.
[277:27.62]If you are wounded, seek out blood to restore your vitality.
[277:32.14]You must know, too, that by drinking the blood of others, you will gradually become stronger and harder to kill.
[277:39.83]We call this a vampire's lore.
[277:43.39]Cain!
[277:44.69]Cain!
[277:45.43]What's happening?
[277:47.31]Why is my house on fire?
[277:49.53]Leave no one here alive, Cain.
[277:51.93]You will need their blood and their lore to survive.
[277:55.72]Now, let us continue.
[277:58.18]OK.
[278:10.68]Wait, I thought that was like funny.
[278:16.30]Alright.
[278:26.67]Remember your fly is down?
[279:00.24]While we are superior to humans in many ways, we also have certain weaknesses that they do not possess.
[279:07.20]Though it is life-giving to humans, water is deadly to vampires.
[279:12.91]Its touch burns our skin.
[279:15.17]Immersion in water can kill us.
[279:17.69]Avoid it at all costs.
[279:19.77]also know that scattered throughout meridian are relics of our ancestors useless to humans only vampires can access these coffers and use the power within seek these out on your journey cool okay so dentist water
[279:45.82]If I could go back and just delete the cane scream, I would.
[279:55.51]I'd sit there and go, like, shit, I wish I could just go into the VOD and just, like, just snip that part out.
[280:01.35]And even if a jump cut, like, people would be like, what happened?
[280:03.79]Why did that happen?
[280:04.73]I'd be like, I don't know, it must have been a glitch with the game or something.
[280:16.45]He's so fixated on this.
[280:27.46]Jesus, am I supposed to be drinking blood?
[280:29.75]I think so.
[280:42.94]Oh my god.
[280:43.86]I wish I could go back in the vault and delete that part.
[280:45.94]Just snip that part.
[280:46.80]Like just that.
[280:47.64]Right when I fell.
[280:51.04]I have such a stupid idea.
[280:52.48]Okay.
[280:55.12]I'm doing it soon.
[280:56.04]I'm going to do it like within the next couple weeks.
[280:58.54]I'm going to pre-record an entire stream.
[281:02.89]No.
[281:03.59]I'm not even going to tell you.
[281:04.61]But you know what I'm going to do.
[281:06.33]I'm just going to pre-record a whole stream.
[281:08.35]I'm just going to cut all the shitty stuff that I do.
[281:21.63]Let's see how long, see what you guys do.
[281:27.49]That's called a YouTube video.
[281:28.97]Yeah, but not the way you think.
[281:30.43]Somebody's got it.
[281:59.33]Yeah, we're talking about as if I played through the game in one try.
[282:07.38]Like, what kind of egomaniac would you have to be?
[282:09.88]What kind of megalomania of making it so I'm trying to make you guys think I beat the game?
[282:17.38]I did everything perfectly or something?
[282:20.00]You have to be kidding me.
[282:23.78]It's going to be a really hard game too.
[282:25.10]Did I say Megalomania?
[282:25.83]Yeah.
[282:25.95]Do you guys not know what that is?
[282:27.49]Press L to block.
[282:54.51]Oh, this is the perfect timing one.
[282:56.43]Okay.
[282:56.75]Cool.
[283:01.09]Hey, it's not that bad.
[283:09.82]We are all armed with a natural weapon.
[283:13.14]Our claws.
[283:15.08]Use them to kill your enemies.
[283:17.60]You can practice by attacking me.
[283:33.75]if you see an enemy become tired use this opportunity to grab him once grabbed you can throw him a great distance hold and hold press y to grab and press wait now you do like a choke
[284:01.51]Oh, OK.
[284:13.55]Excellent.
[284:14.87]Your lesson is over for the moment.
[284:17.73]Continue through the sewer and I shall meet you again shortly.
[284:21.38]Chad is unforgivable tonight.
[284:24.54]I think everyone's been having fun.
[284:27.56]I think Chad's been alright.
[284:49.17]Can you play Conker's Bad Fur Day?
[284:52.93]When I do N64... I'm going to do N64 eventually.
[284:58.48]We'll play a bunch of those.
[284:59.34]Yeah, I'll do a full N64 collection.
[285:15.04]Kind of like this.
[285:15.50]We'll just play a ton of it.
[285:19.37]Conker's on Xbox.
[285:20.15]Yeah, it is.
[285:20.41]First thing I see in chat is what I'm going to eat tonight.
[285:24.53]Bagel.
[285:24.79]Okay.
[285:54.69]Bagel.
[286:00.25]It was like chunks on this.
[286:13.70]But Yuri.
[286:14.52]OK.
[286:24.30]Did I miss it?
[286:24.92]Do a pizza bagel.
[286:35.90]You know, there's a lot of stuff that is so good on a bagel.
[286:39.21]But people just don't ever think to do it.
[286:43.63]Bagel sandwiches.
[286:44.45]And I'm not just talking about egg.
[286:45.71]I'm talking about tuna.
[286:48.25]Like a tuna melt on a bagel.
[286:49.65]Ham sandwich on a bagel.
[286:52.51]Especially if it's warmed up and toasted.
[286:54.96]Mm hmm.
[287:00.28]Oh yeah.
[287:06.71]Ham and cheese on a bagel is perfect.
[287:10.30]Bagel French dip?
[287:11.24]I've never had that.
[287:12.14]Sounds good though.
[287:12.82]A Reuben on a bagel?
[287:40.09]and become nearly invisible, you can move silently to bring down your prey from behind you.
[287:45.68]Cream cheese and lox?
[287:46.44]Yeah.
[287:46.68]I really have to be in the mood for that, though.
[287:48.70]Corned beef is so nasty.
[287:49.62]What?
[287:49.80]Oh, it's not?
[287:50.14]You just never had it made well.
[287:51.40]Maybe you have.
[287:51.80]Okay, mist.
[288:21.80]It's like a stealth mode.
[288:28.17]How did you see me?
[288:33.01]Oh.
[288:54.07]Should I go... Why does it keep telling me to do this?
[289:17.96]I just did it.
[289:22.14]Legacy of...
[289:29.80]Did I not?
[289:30.41]Yeah, I got it.
[289:38.45]What's the next step here?
[289:40.80]Up this way?
[289:41.30]Didn't I come?
[289:43.12]What?
[289:45.12]What do you want me to do?
[289:53.57]I mean, I did that already.
[289:55.07]I already stealth killed that person.
[289:58.93]Where do I go? ...
[290:27.00]Am I missing something here?
[290:32.35]Oh, I can go this way.
[290:37.75]Ooh.
[290:40.47]I actually can use weapons?
[290:44.87]Activate the weapon box while holding a weapon.
[290:52.72]Activate the weapon box while holding a weapon.
[291:14.28]This guy's pretty good.
[291:22.04]Dude, you should do a joke where you pretend that owls are in your room, but you're the only one that can hear them.
[291:25.84]It's fun.
[291:54.14]Yes, son.
[292:22.90]Go 45 minutes without chapstick.
[292:24.78]What will you do if I do?
[292:25.52]Okay.
[292:25.91]What do I get if I do that?
[292:40.57]Ahead is the market where the common dregs of Meridian engage in their filthy commerce.
[292:45.61]Beyond the market is the bridge that leads to the Lower City.
[292:49.50]Make your way east to the bridge.
[292:51.80]I shall meet you there.
[292:52.60]And where are you going?
[292:55.50]I shall scout ahead to ensure that you don't meet any Seraphant patrols.
[292:59.75]You aren't ready for them yet.
[293:01.33]How trusting of you to leave me to my own devices.
[293:04.89]Consider it an act of goodwill.
[293:09.79]How many tubes of chapstick do you go through a month?
[293:12.43]Um... Actually quite a few.
[293:15.61]Not because I use it too much, but because I actually just lose them.
[293:19.13]They just disappear.
[293:21.15]I'll use the same one for a week and then it's gone.
[293:23.50]It does not exist.
[293:24.20]What was that?
[293:57.09]Should I drink everybody's blood?
[294:34.70]Should I?
[294:45.79]What was that powering?
[294:48.84]Stop.
[294:50.46]This is why I fucking hate streaming outside.
[294:52.06]It's so annoying having just like an open roof.
[294:55.24]Streaming with an open roof!
[294:57.90]Jeremy's streaming with an open roof.
[294:58.96]Like, if you complain about your room being so hot, just take the roof off.
[295:02.12]Because I figured there'd be like still privacy and shit.
[295:06.26]Never listening to you fucking idiots ever again.
[295:08.80]I can't go in this.
[295:20.63]What is it powering?
[295:27.96]Something up here?
[295:43.33]No, get away from me.
[295:45.55]I'm playing games.
[295:46.35]You're scaring me.
[295:49.31]Help!
[296:00.94]Help!
[296:04.15]That's generous, all he called it.
[296:06.21]You see that?
[296:07.27]Have you seen what he can do?
[296:08.35]I'm playing games.
[296:09.47]You're scaring me.
[296:10.69]No!
[296:24.88]I'm bored.
[296:25.30]Um, we're just kind of chilling out now.
[296:29.61]I think we hit the peak with the pallbearer scream and now I'm just like kind of, you know, I'm just chill.
[296:34.64]I got all that out of me.
[296:35.44]You know what I mean?
[296:36.36]Just relax it now.
[297:02.84]How much longer?
[297:05.01]At least until the chapstick wears off, because I can't leave for at least 45 minutes.
[297:11.83]There are animals here.
[297:12.69]Okay.
[297:19.22]Alright, this is fun, but I'll do something else.
[297:22.64]It's a cool game.
[297:24.20]I could see myself just sitting on the couch just playing this.
[297:26.76]It's good.
[297:27.80]It's very cool.
[297:29.93]But, eh.
[297:31.69]I think I need to play it.
[297:57.30]It's almost like jumping through a glass window.
[297:59.00]You've never loathed a game more in your life.
[298:24.45]That's not true!
[298:28.15]Come this way.
[298:29.89]Follow me.
[298:30.65]Where are we going?
[298:31.75]I am taking you to Sanctuary, the heart of the Cabal.
[298:35.41]It is time that you meet our leader.
[298:37.35]It was time indeed to hear this so-called leader's plans and learn what he thought his plans might be for me.
[298:45.78]Kane, this way.
[298:49.70]I'm going to play this game called Maximum Chase.
[298:52.20]Here, close the gate.
[298:56.77]Kane, you must find a way to reach the lower city.
[299:00.93]The smuggler's tunnel will take you there.
[299:02.85]Pestilent vampire, die!
[299:07.37]Go to the Grand Hotel in the slums.
[299:09.77]A contact will meet you there.
[299:11.32]He will tell you where to go.
[299:12.98]Stinking, verminous, bloodsucking fiend!
[299:16.12]Do you want your death now?
[299:18.64]Come, and you shall have it.
[299:22.96]Like Links?
[299:23.40]Links is available on the newer platform, isn't it?
[299:26.66]I think you can play it on Game Pass.
[299:28.37]That was a good one.
[299:28.87]That was pretty good.
[299:30.77]Keep going.
[299:53.64]I'm gonna put maximum chase.
[299:56.04]Yeah, it's on Game Pass.
[300:11.57]That was literally sick hair flick.
[300:24.47]You guys fumbled voting for that vampire game?
[300:26.91]No, that game is actually a classic video game.
[300:28.87]It's actually really good.
[300:31.29]But I feel like it... I don't know if I want to play Legacy of Kain for like 20 hours.
[300:39.88]Takes a bit to ramp up.
[300:45.50]Alright, what about this one?
[300:58.31]Based off a book?
[301:08.77]Well, it's based off a movie, clearly.
[301:18.46]Wait, do you film?
[301:26.95]Wait, play the film?
[301:30.83]Let's watch this.
[301:37.18]Alright.

[302:16.20]Stop that!
[302:17.18]Stop it!
[302:17.66]I'm gonna skip.
[302:24.42]Get those fucking flashlights out of my face!
[302:27.20]Stop doing that!
[302:33.92]Oh my god.
[302:35.42]You can't shoot this from the other angle for at least a few of these.
[302:38.18]You have to be facing the camera for all of them.
[302:41.92]Every single shot.
[302:50.44]Oh my god.
[302:51.30]Stop.
[302:51.75]Put them down.
[302:56.95]Even this one!
[302:58.58]You don't need to have this guy doing this!
[303:00.50]Stop aiming this shit in our faces!
[303:03.44]Why are they doing this?!
[303:04.64]Okay.
[303:23.59]Make sure to take out the big case.
[303:25.11]That's just luggage.
[303:26.35]That's luggage.
[303:27.09]Look at... Hold on.
[303:28.11]Can I go back?
[303:30.45]Did you see that?
[303:30.93]This is just luggage.
[303:32.78]This isn't like a big cool briefcase.
[303:34.40]That was like a... Look at this.
[303:40.84]Hold on.
[303:41.52]Let me aim this light in your eyes.
[303:42.84]Come on.
[304:04.16]You're gonna get a copyright strike dude, I don't like this is this is the No, I'm not Don't worry boss, I'm shining a different light in their fucking face.
[304:22.62]Oh
[304:39.98]The CG.
[304:42.50]Okay.
[304:57.19]Very cool.
[304:57.73]So that was some type of... Did we just see everything?
[305:11.74]That wasn't the whole movie, was it?
[305:19.74]Oh, we only have the first cutscene unlocked.
[305:28.59]Well, that's just not gonna do.
[305:30.09]That's not gonna do at all.
[305:56.91]Damn, not bad for a traffic cop.
[306:01.69]Forever the whiner, huh, Irvin?
[306:04.04]Take it like a man this time.
[306:06.38]Man, some of us spent all of last month crushing the drug cartel and haven't had a day off yet.
[306:11.60]Is this dubbed?
[306:12.92]You take your day off.
[306:14.50]I'll take the ticket.
[306:16.32]Whatever.
[306:17.00]Next time I'll be getting your Camaro, man.
[306:19.16]Ho ho.
[306:25.06]What did the last thing we watched have to do with this?
[306:31.51]Did we get hit?
[306:32.89]Did we get hit?
[306:34.55]What the fuck?
[306:35.43]Okay, we're playing this whole game.
[306:40.39]We're not leaving until I beat this whole thing.
[306:54.03]I refuse to stop the stream until this game is done.
[306:56.01]Three, two, one.
[307:01.84]How do I drive?
[307:02.60]How do I drive the car?
[308:03.30]Like, shoot?
[308:06.39]What is happening?
[308:46.63]We would be liquidated right now we would be liquefied right now What I don't get it
[309:14.09]There's no indicator.
[309:15.01]I'm not going anywhere.
[309:43.83]Is this what we just did?
[310:06.35]Alright!
[310:23.75]This is going to go on for a long time without any... Somebody said, dude, this is like a Disney stunt show.
[310:44.86]It's true.
[310:48.34]Same wall.
[311:09.80]What was the objective?
[311:49.14]This is just what happens when you let the DVD submenu just loop over and over and over again of your favorite action movie.
[312:05.03]This just doesn't end.
[312:11.35]Does anybody know what we're supposed to be doing?
[312:14.57]I should have taken it.
[312:18.72]Do something.
[312:19.48]Let me lose these guys.
[312:22.15]Okay, let me lose these guys.
[312:23.81]Lose them.
[313:05.53]Whoa!
[313:44.77]Now what?
[313:45.55]I don't understand what's supposed to happen here.
[314:43.00]Get out of the way.
[315:48.51]Did I finally make it to that part?
[316:28.25]Catch him!
[316:29.86]Damn, he'll take you down!
[316:58.25]This game is fucking terrible.
[317:00.82]This game is so bad.
[317:10.85]Okay, so what do I do?
[317:14.87]There's no map.
[317:15.75]There's no indicators.
[317:16.87]There's no nothing.
[317:17.77]It's just go by that alleyway.
[317:20.05]Dude, I don't know where it's trying to get me to go.
[317:33.23]drive just drive till you see arrows
[318:17.19]My god.
[318:18.17]I think I got it.
[319:00.42]Oh.
[319:45.13]Thank God wait what?
[319:46.83]Alright
[320:16.01]Movie time.
[320:18.29]Wait, do we watch this whole thing?
[320:19.53]I don't think we watch this.
[320:23.90]A bomb?
[320:27.12]Codename?
[320:28.14]Overflare.
[320:29.16]The latest in annihilation.
[320:31.04]One spot from there spells utter disaster for LA.
[320:34.80]Deep impact is gonna look like a puddle.
[320:38.64]At the same time!
[321:12.98]Okay, it hurts my head.
[321:14.30]I can't look at this anymore.
[321:20.06]I can't... I can't skip it.
[321:22.42]We're here.
[321:23.90]Okay.
[321:24.38]No.
[321:24.60]It's too much stimulation.
[321:37.55]Wait, why is it just on the foot of the car?
[321:44.65]He's in it right here.
[321:46.15]They just kind of got lazy at the end of this movie.
[321:54.63]Single angle.
[321:57.81]Wait, did I do that?
[322:00.35]Oh, I did it.
[322:08.88]Okay, I'm done.
[322:10.34]It's almost over.
[322:22.66]He's completely mid.
[322:28.41]Oh.
[322:36.44]Whoa, you see that slow motion, dude?
[323:04.64]Alright, here comes the big finish right here.
[323:06.96]This is it.
[323:07.38]I almost didn't make it.
[323:26.65]Alright, I kind of feel like shit right now.
[323:30.81]I'm Rick.
[323:31.93]What's your name?
[323:33.34]Catherine.
[323:34.56]Catherine Stanfield.
[323:38.56]What the hell happened?
[323:41.01]All I know is I got home and they were there.
[323:44.97]God damn it.
[323:47.19]No, not another chase sequence.
[323:49.33]Not another chase sequence.
[323:51.39]Exercising my right to bear arms.
[323:56.45]Don't stop until we get to the police station.
[324:07.09]Why do I have my hand on the wheel still?
[324:11.69]I'm not firing out the window.
[324:19.85]What was the point of me changing seats?
[324:23.97]I'm helping her drive the car still!
[324:28.52]I just made this way harder for both of us.
[324:31.28]For no reason.
[324:46.51]I haven't shot the gun one time.
[324:47.77]I have not fired the gun once.
[324:52.16]That just was annoying, what I did.
[324:55.42]Okay, here we go.
[325:14.79]What?
[325:15.31]What's happening?
[325:22.69]Why is this a light gun game?
[326:02.08]What?
[326:04.90]I don't... I get... Am I shooting at the right people?
[326:09.59]What are we cautioning?
[326:27.86]Why can't I charge the gun up?
[327:02.96]That's going to be like $200 million.
[327:04.97]I don't know.
[327:06.55]I wouldn't say that.
[327:08.77]This isn't like, oh, don't worry.
[327:09.81]I'll get the check.
[327:11.21]You don't say that here.
[327:12.01]Okay, now there's a... Is that us?
[327:27.10]No.
[327:27.30]No.
[327:32.88]Why are we fighting a tractor?
[327:35.02]What is this?
[327:41.57]Who drove this shit into the parking garage?
[327:57.41]I got it.
[327:57.83]Alright, alright, alright.
[327:58.66]Settle down, settle down, settle down.
[328:30.71]I'm not sure if this is a good idea.
[329:14.77]Somebody just said it and I have to take a second.
[329:17.17]Somebody said this is making me sick.
[329:19.65]Let's take a minute.
[329:21.30]Just one second.
[329:24.66]Okay.
[329:26.94]Just chill for a second.
[329:28.16]Take a sip of water.
[329:29.08]I got some right here.
[329:33.91]I feel like I'm playing every light gun game ever made at the same time.
[329:41.90]In a room full of, I don't know, like screaming bats or something.
[329:56.39]Okay, are we ready?
[329:56.95]Okay.
[330:30.31]Ugh!
[331:00.78]Alright, this is it.
[331:02.49]Alright, come on, this is it.
[332:07.23]Thank God.
[332:11.53]Oh my goodness.
[332:12.41]Thank goodness.
[332:16.10]Oh, this is the, we're not watching this.
[332:28.25]How do I get out of here?
[332:30.74]How do I get out of here?
[332:31.92]How do I get out of here?
[332:33.58]Let's go.
[333:20.19]Are you OK?
[333:22.41]Yeah.
[333:29.25]Crude.
[333:31.43]But effective.
[333:33.81]Wait, this is yeah, this is dubbed over.
[333:36.53]This is dubbed over.
[333:39.00]I thought there was OK.
[333:48.72]I touch your beard, yeah.
[333:49.96]so what now off to the lapd we'll see what they have to say about this it's like ai generated the whole game even the thing they're walking on is green screen
[334:17.56]You're not gonna let us off that easy.
[334:19.62]Wait, why did we get out of the car?
[334:29.00]Emergency police business.
[334:30.20]I gotta commandeer your vehicle.
[334:37.19]So you're a cop?
[334:38.81]Yeah, an off-duty one.
[334:48.50]I can't even react.
[334:49.84]That was just weird.
[334:52.14]Alright, I'm not doing another one of these.
[335:03.27]That's it.
[335:06.11]This is just the same map, but a different car this time.
[335:09.75]It's just a truck replacing the other car.
[335:12.14]I'm going to give this one attempt only.
[335:24.51]We are going one attempt only the rest of the game.
[335:39.23]That was smooth.
[336:01.60]Get off my back!
[336:44.63]I feel like the game is generating the level 15 feet in front of me.
[336:48.26]I don't know where I'm going, but the level's just here.
[336:59.91]Please do an ASMR video with this game.
[337:04.07]Okay, so what we're going to do here is some very quick mouth noises for you to help you sleep.
[337:12.19]I know you're listening to this because it helps you sleep at night.
[337:16.29]There's some stuff in the background.
[337:17.43]Don't pay attention, alright?
[337:18.49]Pay attention to me talking.
[337:21.15]Pop, pop.
[337:34.80]Did I do a full circle?
[337:35.94]It's after some meditation.
[337:46.01]What I want you to do is I want you to breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.
[337:51.43]We'll do it at the same time.
[337:53.05]You and me.
[337:53.45]Ready?
[337:54.55]So here we go.
[337:56.39]It's in.
[337:58.55]Hold it for a second here.
[338:00.86]And then out.
[338:03.22]Very good.
[338:03.84]Very nice.
[338:05.24]Excellent breathing.
[338:07.36]So now what I want you to do is I want you to breathe in again.
[338:09.30]That's right.
[338:12.26]Pay attention to what?
[338:14.54]I haven't known the direction I'm supposed to be driving for the last five straight minutes.
[338:21.89]I'm telling you, the game is being created in front of me.
[338:29.99]I somehow made it.
[339:06.52]We're not watching this.
[339:09.25]Hey, we get to keep going.
[339:17.13]Here.
[339:18.79]Home sweet home.
[339:20.71]I'll just take a quick look around.
[339:26.33]Is that window comically huge?
[339:31.73]Oh, it's a big truck.
[339:32.57]Never mind.
[339:37.79]Officially hit 45 minutes without chapstick.
[339:40.69]Why are these cars like weird bugs?
[340:09.94]This camera shake is so... It doesn't need to be that much.
[340:19.13]They were so afraid of you seeing the outline of the green screen.
[340:23.57]They were terrified of it.
[340:39.26]Are we still going?
[340:40.44]It's a shooting mission.
[340:43.96]First try.
[340:44.37]If I don't get a first try, I'm done.
[340:54.92]I'm not playing this.
[340:55.70]I'm done after this.
[341:15.47]Holy shit!
[342:44.71]What?
[342:44.89]Oh!
[342:44.95]Oh, God.
[342:45.17]Ivan?
[342:45.29]I don't think you can get away with this.
[344:09.05]The only film we are watching is the one that's live-action Hmm
[344:31.40]Rockford Institute.
[344:32.46]That's what Irvin was going on about.
[344:36.21]In connection to this development, James Stanfield lost his life.
[344:40.67]This music does not make any sense in here either.
[344:43.69]What's wrong?
[344:44.28]My brother.
[344:45.36]Your brother?
[344:45.92]He died three days ago.
[345:02.48]Who is this?
[345:29.43]Yeah, they are going... They're going to kill that guy.
[345:37.32]Oh, my... Who are these people?
[345:48.14]Who are these people?
[345:49.44]Please turn it down.
[345:50.82]Fine.
[345:55.09]Whoa.
[346:33.15]Why is this even here?
[346:34.19]Why can you even do this?
[346:35.37]What's the point of that?
[346:42.50]Great view, except for the view behind us.
[346:59.72]Vegas.
[347:01.26]I like that place.
[347:02.18]What?
[347:02.36]Was I not...
[347:58.75]I don't know where to go.
[348:06.65]You're lost?
[348:07.41]Yeah.
[348:12.60]Other side.
[348:22.84]Wrong way.
[348:24.98]Go around it.
[348:25.66]I see what you mean.
[348:53.44]It's hard to see.
[349:17.65]Outta my way.
[350:04.20]I just suppressed a yawn and it fucked everything up.
[350:40.02]It's... Ah!
[350:49.70]I kind of, like, want to lose.
[350:53.19]But I can't.
[350:53.81]I'm playing too good.
[350:55.69]What is that?
[350:56.07]Is that, like, a big, um...
[351:08.50]It's a keepsake from my mother.
[351:12.58]My brother had it, but... What is it?
[351:19.15]Don't touch that!
[351:20.11]And this?
[351:22.29]What?
[351:22.57]I never knew it opened.
[351:24.17]Oh my god.
[351:24.83]Oh my god.
[351:25.99]Oh my god.
[351:30.92]Hey, maybe that's it.
[351:34.42]My brother's friend.
[351:36.43]Where have I seen that before?
[351:39.57]That exact look.
[351:41.37]What is that?
[351:43.31]Yep, it's TMNT.
[351:44.81]TMNT Ooze.
[351:47.45]That is just TMNT Ooze.
[351:49.02]I love how he has a revolver like that that has six bullets, but yet I shoot four or five thousand times.
[352:02.63]I really don't want to do this.
[352:03.85]I'm going to turn it way down.
[352:07.85]Here, I'll make this more tolerable for everybody.
[353:31.83]Watch the bumps!
[354:22.30]What, a tropical beach in the background?
[354:24.28]I don't- I don't have access to that right now.
[354:26.90]I don't have a tropical beach!
[354:30.41]I gotta fight this boss!
[354:31.69]Wait.
[355:55.01]Die!
[356:00.01]Nooo!
[356:05.75]Put Family Guy moments in the top right corner.
[356:11.55]I can't do that.
[356:13.67]I can't do that.
[356:14.55]That actually will get me in trouble, dude.
[356:16.63]I can't- I can't do that.
[356:18.85]You don't understand, I can't do that.
[356:20.85]As fucking funny as that would be.
[356:32.79]What, a Jerma compilation in the top right corner?
[356:35.19]What?
[356:35.39]What do you mean Jerma compilation?
[356:38.08]Okay.
[357:01.68]I need to fit shit in here.
[357:04.95]What video do you want me to put on?
[357:10.55]Put Temple Run gameplay at the bottom.
[357:19.86]Put on JermaCraft?
[357:21.47]No.
[357:35.03]How about a bird cam?
[357:35.99]I think that works.
[357:36.91]Alright, like just bird cam.
[357:43.12]Like birds.
[357:46.70]Bird.
[357:50.30]Cam.
[357:54.14]Dermot's worst face and worst moment.
[357:56.26]Dermot laughing at vehicle accidents.
[357:59.02]Okay, hold on.
[358:00.65]I'll put this one on to see if it, we'll get to see if it matches.
[358:04.13]Okay, wait, I'm interested in this.
[358:07.90]So keep in mind, I, I cannot hear it.
[358:11.64]So I don't know how much it matches up.
[358:13.36]I cannot hear it.
[358:15.60]This is apparently me laughing at vehicle accidents.
[358:23.35]How loud is this though?
[358:27.35]This is gonna be so stupid.
[358:29.96]Okay, fine.
[358:59.84]Okay.
[359:00.79]How's the audio?
[359:01.37]Good?
[359:02.49]Jesus, dude.
[359:09.78]Alright.
[359:10.16]Let's go.
[359:10.52]Let's go.
[359:10.92]Let's go.
[359:11.26]Let's go.
[359:13.44]Get the fuck out of the way.
[359:14.51]Good cop.
[359:19.55]James might have had the last laugh.
[359:22.53]This is the catalyst to the bomb.
[359:24.77]The bomb?
[359:26.05]James was developing Overflare, a new generation in energy bombs.
[359:31.24]So without this, Overflare can't even light a cigarette.
[359:35.80]There's no point in you keeping it.
[359:37.70]So if you don't mind, how about I... Why would we mind?
[359:41.36]Besides, they'll only come after you next.
[359:43.97]I don't want to put it louder.
[359:45.53]You're trying to... You're trying to piss off everybody.
[359:48.38]We need to wait until after the cutscene.
[360:13.09]Okay, here we go.
[360:14.35]Let's go!
[360:14.77]The driver is Juan Rich Summer, an LAPD traffic division officer.
[360:27.98]All cars in the area, please pursue immediately.
[360:30.36]Unit 610, please respond.
[360:31.42]The vehicle is electric SB430.
[360:32.42]Oh no!
[360:32.62]We're trapped!
[360:32.98]Let's see what this lady's got.
[360:51.33]I'm going to get ADHD.
[361:00.14]Is it too loud?
[361:00.86]No, it doesn't look like it.
[361:01.96]I think it's okay.
[361:02.58]This is a great stream, Jerma.
[361:06.38]You meant that as an insult, I think, but I think it's fun.
[361:09.93]Alright, let's go.
[361:10.49]Let's go.
[361:10.79]Let's go.
[361:11.31]Let's go.
[361:12.23]Hold on tight.
[361:55.66]I'm putting a stop to this right now.
[362:05.18]I'm putting a stop to this right now.
[362:10.45]I somebody said to put slime videos like the people when they play with this you know what I'm gonna tell you guys something because I think have I talked about this before I don't care about leaking shit because who cares I'm definitely not gonna do it at this point but maybe maybe somebody will maybe someone will did I talk about
[362:35.73]Spending, like, years straight making children's videos for YouTube.
[362:43.63]And don't tell anyone.
[362:46.18]And just see how long it takes for people to figure it out.
[362:49.54]I did, I've talked about that, right?
[362:53.04]A long time ago, I wanted to do, like, double time.
[362:58.15]Streaming this is the purpose maybe like four or five years ago.
[363:00.99]I wanted to stream and have a different YouTube channel where I just made children's videos as a different person
[363:10.91]And still stream the same amount of time that I do.
[363:13.87]But have this like.
[363:15.73]Kids kind of content.
[363:17.72]Where I was doing like all kinds of like wacky stuff.
[363:19.42]It's like oh Mr. Goofball.
[363:21.48]And make hundreds of videos.
[363:23.50]Hundreds of them.
[363:24.90]Hundreds of them.
[363:26.48]And see how long it took.
[363:27.98]Before people figured it out.
[363:31.12]Because you know that if I did this for like two or three years.
[363:34.64]And eventually everybody found it.
[363:35.79]It would be.
[363:39.59]Like what.
[363:42.06]What are you doing?
[363:44.14]You mean to tell me that there are years worth of children's videos that you've made?
[363:48.92]High production value, by the way.
[363:50.91]Not dog shit.
[363:52.01]Not just like five seconds.
[363:53.35]We're talking like 10 to 15 minute long real educational shit.
[363:59.55]And there would be like 500 or 600 videos over the course of five years.
[364:03.29]I wanted to do it so bad, but it was just too much work.
[364:09.43]It's okay.
[364:09.93]Don't worry.
[364:10.81]Yeah.
[364:12.88]Why children's videos?
[364:14.10]I don't know, because, like, I had this thing in my brain where, like, I was going to see if I could hit a billion views on that channel before, like, Jerma985 hit, like, I don't know, like, a certain amount of subs or something.
[364:28.35]I was going to play this internal game with myself.
[364:31.27]See if I could hit, like, a billion views with, like, children's videos.
[364:36.97]See if I could, like, overtake the other channel.
[364:45.78]Why not elderly videos?
[364:50.75]What do you mean?
[364:51.37]Yeah, why?
[364:51.93]Well, that's a good question to ask yourself.
[364:56.23]Yeah, I was thinking I could get like a billion views.
[364:59.31]A billion of them.
[365:00.25]A billion views.
[365:01.17]A billion of those views.
[365:06.55]How many views are on the regular channel?
[365:08.71]How many views are on the regular channel?
[365:10.07]Like just like the Jerma NA5 YouTube channel?
[365:13.22]500 million?
[365:13.82]300 million?
[365:14.80]I could have gotten to a billion views.
[365:16.64]A billion.
[365:21.46]Let's say this two or three, 250 million.
[365:24.44]I could have done it.
[365:44.71]Dude, you've gone completely off the deep end.
[365:49.21]I would- you know what?
[365:50.01]I would have real- no, it wouldn't have been slime videos.
[365:52.59]It wouldn't have been slime videos.
[365:53.55]It would have been, like, high-quality children's entertainment.
[365:56.45]I would have made sure that it was, like, the best videos.
[365:59.25]I was gonna make, like, characters and- and, like, puppets and shit.
[366:04.89]Like, it was gonna be awesome.
[366:06.23]It was gonna be truly fun.
[366:08.95]Dinosaur videos, oh yeah.
[366:11.03]Animated stuff.
[366:12.52]I was going to really go all into it.
[366:14.06]I was going to go all out.
[366:27.54]The channel has 224 million views.
[366:32.93]The auto show, that's exactly what I mean.
[366:36.15]Auto show would have been perfect.
[366:40.38]I would have done the voice and everything too.
[366:46.86]Aren't you already making videos for children?
[366:58.37]No.
[366:58.67]No.
[366:59.44]No.
[367:00.24]That's not true actually.
[367:03.62]Second Jerma has 245 million.
[367:08.19]So I got about half a billion views across the two YouTube channels.
[367:20.52]What just happened?
[367:25.10]Why is this helicopter in such a weird spot?
[367:31.54]I lost.
[367:31.88]Alright, that's it.
[367:35.15]I'm done.
[367:42.71]I think it would have been fun.
[367:49.30]Yeah, I think it's a good place to call it.
[367:50.96]I'm hungry.
[367:51.48]I'm getting hungry.
[367:56.84]Well, I apologize to the 2,000 people that left when I screamed the pallbearer thing.
[368:00.66]Hopefully you don't hate me forever.
[368:04.15]Do a children's show stream?
[368:06.64]I mean, there's, yeah, trust me, I've thought about it.
[368:11.88]Where the stream just turns on and it's just like a Sesame Street show.
[368:19.41]And it's not, I don't, we don't talk, it's just like, yeah, of course, of course I'm going to do like a children's entertainment stream.
[368:32.97]And it wouldn't be funny.
[368:34.27]It's not gonna be funny.
[368:35.79]Like, oh, this is what a funny... No, no, no.
[368:37.70]No, no.
[368:37.94]Excuse me.
[368:39.38]This is gonna be a quality children's entertainment stream.
[368:43.42]I'm gonna... I'm writing it down.
[368:47.14]I'm writing it down.
[368:48.56]I'll write it down.
[368:57.89]You're so weird, man.
[369:04.97]Well.
[369:09.25]You should... It's kind of like the Muppets.
[369:12.71]I wonder... Okay, what... What if it's really fun, though?
[369:17.75]Hey, can you talk in the background for a little while while I play some shit?
[369:20.20]Yeah, sure.
[369:20.60]Five minutes.
[369:25.58]That would be cool if it's not terrible.
[369:30.02]God damn it.
[369:37.21]I see a bunch of, like, puppets and stuff.
[369:41.11]Me interacting with them.
[369:44.31]And, like, don't eat that many cookies.
[369:59.04]When's the next Breath of the Wild stream?
[370:00.28]I'm begging you.
[370:02.01]Um, probably soon.
[370:06.42]There's gonna be a lot of chill streams this year, too.
[370:08.82]I think I talked about it already.
[370:11.86]But... Maybe there'll be some children's entertainment streams.
[370:17.82]Along with, like, just chilling out, playing games.
[370:20.13]I'm gonna play Breath of the Wild, I promise, but I'm gonna do some chill streams.
[370:25.89]Alright.
[370:27.67]I'll see you guys later.
[370:28.31]I'll see you guys... Actually, there's a big thing coming up here this weekend.
[370:33.54]Elden Ring co-op mod with Ster.
[370:37.84]With randomizer turned on.
[370:42.38]It's going to be probably pretty cool.
[370:44.33]I'm looking forward to it.
[370:46.99]Seems like a pretty simple thing.
[370:48.13]We're going to test it a little bit.
[370:49.51]So that's Saturday.
[370:51.09]We'll see you Saturday.
[370:51.79]I think we're starting at 2.
[370:53.91]So 2 p.m.
[370:54.41]Pacific.
[370:56.14]What is randomizer?
[370:57.50]It is every single enemy and every single item.
[371:00.67]Could be wrong.
[371:01.79]But it's every enemy in the game is completely randomized.
[371:04.23]It could be a boss.
[371:05.53]Or it could just be like a rat.
[371:08.63]You can walk out the front door and one of the dragons just might be there.
[371:12.55]Out the front door.
[371:13.62]Good luck.
[371:17.20]Yeah, that was some more Xbox.
[371:18.52]There is a lot more PS1, PS2, and Xbox.
[371:22.50]But
[371:24.23]I don't want a sensory overload.
[371:25.65]I feel a little sensory overloaded right now.
[371:27.37]I'm going to get some food.
[371:30.37]I'm going to relax.
[371:31.13]And I'll see you guys on Saturday for Elden Ring.
[371:32.51]We'll put it away for a little bit.
[371:35.84]Hope you guys had fun with these streams.
[371:37.36]They're always really fun for me to do.
[371:39.12]Hopefully they're fun for you to watch.
[371:40.68]Maybe we'll see you again.
[371:45.08]Let's say our goodbyes.
[372:01.13]Oh, okay.
[372:04.11]There were some really good ones.
[372:05.45]I feel like the Xbox has had some real quality stuff.
[372:09.41]I mean, Indiana Jones was... Eragon was... Well, that one was cool.
[372:14.88]What else was there?
[372:15.64]Maximum Chase.
[372:16.26]Remember that one?
[372:16.76]That was pretty fun.
[372:19.00]Circus Maximus might be my favorite game of the night.
[372:30.85]You're allergic to jet set radio.
[372:33.41]I played it for Dreamcast a couple of years ago, two, three years ago.
[372:38.73]Now, I'm not against going back to old games that I played that I've already done.
[372:44.69]But I mean, if we've done it already, it exists already.
[372:49.48]I actually remember playing it and I didn't like it.
[372:52.56]I remember being like, oh, the controls are stupid.
[372:54.90]It's too hard.
[372:55.72]Remember, that was a complaining stream.
[372:57.96]It was.
[373:03.38]Yeah, I was a complainer.
[373:07.36]Music's great, though.
[373:15.69]The main lasso, though.
[373:17.31]God, I know.
[373:18.37]I know.
[373:24.87]That might be one of the worst things that's ever been recorded of me doing.
[373:31.20]It was so bad.
[373:33.52]Alright, I'll take, uh... I'll take my... Wait, hold on.
[373:39.60]A lot of subs today.
[373:41.22]Damn.
[373:42.74]Thanks, guys.
[373:46.64]Uh, eat at least one serving of vegetables today, please.
[373:50.39]Uh, drink a glass of water if you haven't.
[373:51.83]Drink one glass of water if you haven't already.
[373:56.25]Listen to your mother.
[374:00.23]You know?
[374:01.55]Eat some vegetables if you haven't.
[374:06.93]Do carrots and ranch count?
[374:08.41]Yeah.
[374:09.69]Moisturize your face with a face moisturizer.
[374:12.25]Don't skimp on that.
[374:13.11]Do that.
[374:16.86]When you come out of the shower, just put a little, you know, moisturize your face.
[374:34.55]Cover?
[374:35.27]No.
[374:35.80]Alright, take it easy guys.
[374:39.98]See you later.
[374:40.82]See you Saturday.
[374:42.18]Elden Ring.
[374:43.04]I'm excited.
[374:43.94]It's the first time I've actually played Elden Ring or streamed it or touched it since the game came out.
[374:51.20]Like a month or two after the game came out.
[374:54.24]So, I'm excited.
[374:56.78]See you later.
[374:57.56]Take care.
[374:57.84]Have a good night.
[375:04.19]you
[375:39.05]you
