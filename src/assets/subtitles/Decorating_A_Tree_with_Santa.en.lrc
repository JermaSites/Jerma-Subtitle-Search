[00:37.96]Merry Christmas, everybody.
[00:39.64]Well, not yet.
[00:40.80]Hold on.
[00:41.10]These are going to be annoying.
[00:47.69]I'm not sure I even want to do this anymore.
[00:52.63]That's going to be real fucking irritating.
[00:56.65]Can I put this like really low?
[00:58.27]I don't want this to be that loud.
[01:02.85]Do you guys want music?
[01:03.77]Fuck the music.
[01:04.49]I'm turning it off.
[01:09.50]Oh.
[01:11.24]What else is on here?
[01:13.92]I want instrumental.
[01:14.72]I don't want people fucking singing.
[01:19.22]It's just a hundred fucking dollars right now.
[01:23.64]Pin just gave a hundred bucks.
[01:26.70]Thank you so much, Pin.
[01:27.76]Santa joke incoming, fellow germamites.
[01:32.71]There is not.
[01:34.07]I'm decorating my tree.
[01:36.37]Thank you so much, though, Pin.
[01:37.69]I really appreciate it.
[01:38.83]That's a fucking hundred dollars, dude.
[01:42.94]This is three hours long.
[01:44.02]Is this good?
[01:45.76]There we go.
[01:49.89]Let's turn it like that.
[01:52.53]It needs to be super in the fucking background.
[01:54.82]I don't want it to be that loud.
[01:57.76]I'm going to adjust this eventually.
[02:00.30]Here we go.
[02:01.96]Is that a good level?
[02:02.68]It's a light level.
[02:04.32]It's very light.
[02:07.07]But Pin, what a fucking god damn hero.
[02:12.03]$100 right off the bat.
[02:12.75]Why is he a hero?
[02:14.79]I don't know.
[02:15.71]But thank you, though.
[02:16.37]That is really, really, really generous of you.
[02:18.25]Merry Christmas to you.
[02:19.79]Good tidings to you and your family and your loved ones.
[02:22.99]Ah, so sticks renegade in gear, dude.
[02:24.39]Thanks for the bits.
[02:25.19]It's Christmas time.
[02:25.97]Christmas time.
[02:26.59]Christmas time.
[02:27.11]It is.
[02:28.71]By the way, I will not be able to see chat, really, or the notifications when we get started here.
[02:35.29]So, I won't be able to read bits.
[02:39.39]I'm going to be decorating a tree.
[02:40.55]I won't be able to see chat that well.
[02:43.05]Maybe I will.
[02:43.45]I'll lean in sometimes.
[02:47.18]Is there a bunch of ads in this video?
[02:48.92]No, there's not.
[02:49.98]Okay.
[02:52.94]And, ladies and gentlemen, what's this?
[02:55.56]Are we ready to turn it on?
[02:56.78]I think we are.
[03:01.67]Hey!
[03:03.23]Merry fucking Christmas!
[03:05.79]There's the tree.
[03:08.11]See, I told you I was going to be looking like a dickhead today.
[03:13.66]Is it in a good spot?
[03:14.52]The camera's in a good spot, right?
[03:15.46]You can see that?
[03:18.99]Is the tree taller than me?
[03:20.41]No, it's not.
[03:21.49]I'll show you in a minute.
[03:23.91]I fucking hate this music.
[03:25.31]Can I turn the music off?
[03:26.78]Are you guys alright with me turning it off?
[03:28.00]I don't fucking like it.
[03:28.76]I don't want it.
[03:32.10]It's so low.
[03:32.82]Let me get on my knees here.
[03:35.56]This over here.
[03:36.84]That over there.
[03:39.65]No, keep it on.
[03:40.87]I'm keeping it at an extraordinarily low level.
[03:44.41]I swear to God, if there's a screamer in this fucking... Look, if I were a dickhead, I would put a screamer in a Christmas fucking playlist.
[03:53.54]Wouldn't you?
[03:53.88]Hey, crack up with a fucking cold one.
[03:57.52]It's Christmas, for God's sakes.
[03:59.86]You can't even hear it.
[04:01.52]No, it's good.
[04:01.80]It's supposed to be in the background.
[04:05.31]I look like Leon Kennedy.
[04:08.39]Good.
[04:11.06]I look like an elf.
[04:13.28]Get him out of here for life.
[04:15.02]Anyways, let's go.
[04:16.02]I have a lot of stuff to do.
[04:18.54]Welcome.
[04:18.94]Merry Christmas if you celebrate.
[04:20.02]Happy holidays if you don't.
[04:22.65]Put on death metal.
[04:23.59]No!
[04:23.95]This is just gonna... Look.
[04:26.41]Let's just get started.
[04:28.61]I'm not gonna waste any time here.
[04:29.73]I gotta be in the Christmas spirit.
[04:37.01]And what that means is sometimes you gotta...
[04:39.45]Got to get a ring pop on.
[04:41.01]These are Christmas ring pops.
[04:42.59]They're red.
[04:43.15]Get that one on there.
[04:47.35]We also got green ring pops too.
[04:52.04]Got to have a red and a green ring pop, otherwise it's not even fucking Christmas.
[05:00.60]Ooh, nice.
[05:01.34]These are watermelon and strawberry.
[05:03.90]If you're curious.
[05:04.68]Let's go ahead and get that on here.
[05:10.27]Merry Christmas.
[05:11.19]A couple of more Ring Pops on here.
[05:16.79]Ah, 2020 hindsight, probably should have taken these out of the package way before I started.
[05:20.19]Let's get some Ring Pops on here.
[05:24.13]Red, green, there we go.
[05:24.85]Let's get that there.
[05:26.96]Let's get another Ring Pop on here.
[05:32.40]It's just getting started, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:37.52]There we go.
[05:39.34]Red, green, red, green, right?
[05:42.80]That's red.
[05:44.50]Goes in between there.
[05:46.06]There we go, see?
[05:47.24]Christmas, red, green, red, green.
[05:51.58]Perfect.
[05:52.32]Let's get another ring pop-up here.
[05:59.79]I can't even open them.
[06:00.67]I know, because they're fucking sealed shut.
[06:04.14]Let's get another green pop on here.
[06:05.54]What do we got?
[06:06.42]Red, green, red, green?
[06:07.90]Let's go the opposite here.
[06:09.58]Like that.
[06:11.09]Okay, let's get another one here.
[06:18.29]Looks good.
[06:18.81]There we are.
[06:22.35]Oh, whoops.
[06:22.71]Don't drop them.
[06:23.37]I'm going to be eating these the whole string.
[06:24.67]There we go.
[06:26.07]That's good.
[06:26.71]Green.
[06:27.47]This one's more orange than it is green.
[06:31.34]Let's get another one.
[06:38.49]There we are.
[06:39.37]This one's green as well.
[06:40.47]Let's put this little guy on the ring finger.
[06:43.99]Loving the Infinity War trailer?
[06:47.24]What are you talking about?
[06:49.74]Let's get that one on here.
[06:52.16]Alright.

[08:06.26]Get the fucking shit out of your system.
[08:08.53]This is gonna stay where it is.
[08:10.83]This is a goddamn family stream, for Christ's sake.
[08:14.25]So let's start off.
[08:16.79]How do you decorate a tree?
[08:19.43]I have no idea.
[08:20.76]I haven't done this since I was like eight.
[08:25.76]Oh, okay.
[08:27.38]Start with these.
[08:32.53]I might need a pair of scissors.
[08:33.43]I don't think I'm going to have a pair of scissors down here.
[08:35.91]Well, we start off with our three snowy Christmas decoration trees.
[08:45.08]I'm not destroying the fucking room.
[08:48.82]These are like snow trees.
[08:49.86]These will look good sitting here out here.
[08:51.91]They'll look good.
[08:52.97]I think they already have batteries in them.
[08:54.31]I think that's good.
[08:57.19]Let's go with the big one first.
[09:00.09]Let's just turn it on.
[09:00.85]It's going to tab you at the pole.
[09:03.23]Of course it does.
[09:05.66]And look at that.
[09:09.86]The first decoration of the evening is a multicolored changing light.
[09:15.70]We're gonna get all three of them out here.
[09:18.04]Pay no attention to this dog shit.
[09:19.26]We'll fix that.
[09:24.66]The tab to pull.
[09:26.74]Turn this one on too.
[09:28.20]See, we're going easy.
[09:31.34]No bullshit.
[09:34.25]Can't see what anybody's saying I'll do that on purpose because people think I'm gonna like break my room I Should put this on too, right?
[09:51.99]It looks good like this How does this go on I Don't know right Larry.
[09:59.45]Let's put like I don't want to touch these on my head.
[10:01.11]I
[10:03.50]If these fall off on the stream, the stream ends.
[10:09.04]Why did I say that?
[10:09.72]That's a fucking stupid idea.
[10:10.84]There we go.
[10:13.63]Alright.
[10:19.49]I'm not wearing it.
[10:20.53]I refuse to wear that.
[10:22.59]That's like a sex item.
[10:23.95]You know what I mean?
[10:25.83]You wear that if you come out of a cake.
[10:27.75]You know what I'm saying?
[10:29.24]I ain't wearing that shit.
[10:31.78]It is kind of a treat.
[10:36.30]Alright, let's get some ornaments here.
[10:39.22]I guess I could start with that, right?
[10:40.16]What do we got in here?
[10:43.18]This thing is really annoying.
[10:44.42]I apologize in advance.
[10:46.68]It makes a lot of fucking noise.
[10:47.93]Couple of ring pops.
[10:50.55]This is my bag of tricks.
[10:54.31]And in here we have, start with the lights.
[10:57.21]So I'm gonna untwine these.
[11:00.77]I think I'm gonna,
[11:02.43]Because these are battery operated.
[11:03.53]I ain't fucking blowing a fuse in my house, guys.
[11:05.41]That's not going to happen.
[11:07.43]If you think for a second that the fuse is going to blow.
[11:11.58]Nope.
[11:11.88]Let's try this.
[11:15.22]Hey, look at that.
[11:16.88]They work.
[11:17.66]Thank God.
[11:19.74]So let's go ahead and make ourselves a little more in the holiday spirit.
[11:23.32]You know what I mean?
[11:23.78]Let's put that in the old pocket there and let's go like this.
[11:28.46]I could wear this for the whole stream, essentially, right?
[11:32.31]Because it's battery operated.
[11:33.73]We ain't plugging much in.
[11:36.02]There are like two or three plugs to plug in.
[11:38.54]Alright, don't break one.
[11:41.90]If you break one, the whole thing goes down.
[11:44.34]That's my understanding, right?
[11:48.54]Fuck it, just get the whole thing on.
[11:49.61]Who cares?
[11:51.83]Let's go like this.
[11:56.71]That's good, right?
[11:58.53]Look good?
[11:59.47]How's it look?
[12:00.93]Are we good?
[12:03.50]Eat the lights.
[12:04.18]Why would I do that?
[12:04.84]That sounds like a fucking terrible idea.
[12:09.21]How did this happen?
[12:10.33]I'm tangled into my headphones.
[12:16.77]It looks fucking awful.
[12:19.01]No, it doesn't.
[12:19.46]Well, it's alright.
[12:22.30]I'm going to put another one on.
[12:24.28]Let's do this one.
[12:24.74]I got... No, I want a colored one.
[12:27.14]I want colored lights.
[12:27.84]Let's put one of this bucket over here.
[12:32.64]Should I like, maybe I should turn the light off too so you can see how cool it looks.
[12:35.32]Looks pretty cool.
[12:38.98]Can't wait to fucking push this tree down.
[12:42.50]I am going to throw this tree down at the end of the stream.
[12:44.84]You guys just wait.
[12:46.88]Let's take that off.
[12:49.14]And oh, I didn't turn it on.
[12:51.40]Doink!
[12:55.77]There we go.
[12:56.43]I hope I don't get like fucking electrocuted.
[13:00.69]If I start, like, shaking, then there's a problem.
[13:03.29]I'm going to do this to the tree, too.
[13:07.77]There we go.
[13:08.19]There's that.
[13:08.81]I wrap it around.
[13:09.63]And that's much better.
[13:11.45]It almost looks like I have barbed wire wrapped around my whole body.
[13:15.06]That's good.
[13:15.42]Alright.
[13:17.28]Let's, like, stick that under here.
[13:18.78]And there we are.
[13:21.40]Perfect.
[13:22.24]No, not yet.
[13:22.96]Get this wrapped around the legs and the pocket.
[13:27.21]Alright.
[13:28.33]Now I can start decorating the tree.
[13:29.47]Now I'm in the holiday spirit.
[13:30.73]I'm ready to go.
[13:32.53]We've got these three.
[13:33.15]Make sure these are in a good spot.
[13:33.99]We've got to go small, medium, large.
[13:36.77]Like that.
[13:38.55]There we are.
[13:39.04]Okay.
[13:41.14]There's some tinsel.
[13:42.88]Here's the tree so far.
[13:44.02]It's obviously empty.
[13:46.08]Let's get a little bit of tinsel on there.
[13:47.32]I don't know how this works.
[13:54.58]That's it.
[13:55.41]What?
[13:56.81]How does this work?
[14:00.77]That was embarrassing.
[14:02.03]I just couldn't pull it.
[14:03.05]Let's go like this.
[14:08.45]I have to untwine this whole fucking thing?
[14:09.95]Are you serious?
[14:11.06]That's annoying.
[14:11.68]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[14:12.20]Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[14:13.06]I don't want to drop these all.
[14:15.34]Strawberry.
[14:17.14]So we'll start.
[14:17.60]We're going to glaze the tree with a little bit of tinsel.
[14:20.10]There it goes.
[14:24.43]I probably shouldn't be starting with tinsel.
[14:29.78]Alright, that looks alright so far.
[14:31.56]Yeah, it kind of just looks like somebody sneezed on the tree.
[14:37.20]Get it like down here.
[14:40.00]You know the real terrible thing about tinsel?
[14:44.11]Is this shit ain't biodegradable.
[14:46.95]So don't throw this shit in the sewer, kids.
[14:49.27]You're going to kill all the ducks.
[14:51.63]Alright, tinsel is on.
[14:55.39]Where's my drink?
[14:58.70]I fucking wanna take these off so bad.
[15:00.26]I wanna get these off so bad.
[15:04.88]Was it funny?
[15:05.78]Did you think it was funny?
[15:06.76]Cause they're coming off.
[15:10.92]Alright, somebody like fucking, somebody snot rocketed my tree.
[15:19.77]What do you think Santa?
[15:21.35]Is it going good so far?
[15:22.31]Whoa.
[15:24.05]Alright, there's the tinsel.
[15:26.84]You guys didn't think I had more tinsel, you're out of your fucking minds.
[15:30.36]I got red tinsel.
[15:32.80]This one is already out of the package.
[15:34.38]You don't have to untwine anything.
[15:35.52]I'm gonna go, oh, um.
[15:45.45]That's not what I wanted.
[15:46.37]I mean, it looks alright.
[15:49.11]It looks okay.
[15:49.87]It doesn't look terrible yet.
[15:51.01]Maybe I shouldn't use the whole bag.
[15:58.50]No, take... Get the fuck out of here.
[16:05.61]Oh, shit.
[16:09.10]He's already coming off.
[16:12.26]Oh, god damn it.
[16:12.98]I've ruined the fucking... I've ruined the fucking blow pops.
[16:17.27]How about around here?
[16:28.28]Alright, we got a little bit of tinsel on.
[16:30.84]We got a little bit of tinsel on in the air, you know, just a little bit in the air.
[16:33.84]It ain't coming off.
[16:36.28]So let's move on to ornaments.
[16:40.56]It looks like cousin It got hit in the head with an ax.
[16:44.13]Fuck, this is just everywhere.
[16:48.25]What a fucking idiot.
[16:48.97]Alright, let's start with, you gotta do lights first, I think.
[16:53.61]That's kinda how it works.
[17:00.24]It's not going to work.
[17:01.68]I have to get these fucking ring pops off.
[17:04.22]This is like the... Of course the first thing I do is the thing that ruins this whole thing.
[17:11.62]Fucking ridiculous.
[17:13.04]There we go.
[17:14.02]Alright, I'm going to just walk around the tree.
[17:16.27]Like this.
[17:17.61]Let's turn them on.
[17:21.47]On, right?
[17:21.85]So these are colored?
[17:22.97]Yes, they are.
[17:23.39]Nice multicolor here.
[17:26.24]So let's walk around the tree.
[17:27.66]I'm going to stick this in the bottom so it doesn't fall.
[17:31.27]Well, it fell anyways.
[17:31.99]Who cares?
[17:33.21]And let's go around.
[17:34.35]So feed it around the side here.
[17:35.73]I'm going to go all the way around from the bottom up.
[17:40.05]Looks alright so far.
[17:41.01]Keep going.
[17:43.49]Tree ain't coming down.
[17:44.33]I can fucking guarantee that.
[17:47.93]Look, it's Christmas.
[17:50.14]I got like five more of these.
[17:51.40]Don't worry.
[17:52.46]This is going to be the most beautiful tree you've ever seen in your life.
[17:55.63]How's that look?
[17:56.19]It looks alright so far?
[17:57.91]I like it.
[17:58.47]Did it move anything?
[17:59.65]No.
[18:04.15]This is tin so we can get that out of the way.
[18:05.59]Do I have any more of those?
[18:08.63]I have a couple more.
[18:09.13]Let's do one more.
[18:12.95]These are just regular.
[18:14.22]These aren't, these are just regular lights.
[18:16.80]These are just white.
[18:24.01]Just regular lights that we can add.
[18:27.09]Look, when the stream's over, I'm gonna turn the lights off, and everyone's gonna go, ooh, wow.
[18:35.50]You know, that's what you guys are gonna do.
[18:37.56]I don't even have to say that, because once the lights go off, ooh.
[18:42.68]Easiest fucking thing I've ever done, decorating a tree.
[18:45.80]Let's go around.
[18:47.74]This way.
[18:48.32]These ones are gonna be around the top here.
[18:53.85]I'm kind of constricted by the other shit I have on me.
[18:57.53]Wrap around.
[18:58.49]Just don't break any.
[19:04.15]Looks good.
[19:06.59]Get.
[19:11.76]I shouldn't be wetting them.
[19:12.76]Alright.
[19:13.04]So we need a little bit more over here.
[19:15.96]The left side is a little bit neglected right now.
[19:21.10]Alright.
[19:21.74]Now we can go.
[19:22.54]We can keep going.
[19:28.11]Should I put a stocking on there?
[19:29.72]Yeah.
[19:30.86]Where do you think it should go?
[19:31.66]Like right here?
[19:34.12]Right here?
[19:36.58]Yeah, like, I don't know.
[19:37.96]That shouldn't be on the tree.
[19:38.78]We'll put that somewhere else.
[19:40.88]Alright, all these are good.
[19:42.06]This fucking thing.
[19:47.64]Move that out of the way.
[19:49.61]We got one more thing of lights to do, but I don't think I'm gonna do this yet.
[19:53.75]This looks good.
[19:55.42]Have any more drinks?
[19:56.00]Am I out of drink right now?
[19:57.42]I'm going to have to go get like more drink.
[19:59.64]I like need this.
[20:07.29]You don't put the stocking on the tree.
[20:10.09]You decorate your tree the way you want.
[20:11.41]I decorate my tree the way I want.
[20:13.11]Yeah, I need more drink.
[20:19.78]Give me two seconds.
[20:21.27]I'm going to go grab a drink.
[20:22.88]I'll be right back.
[20:24.24]Everybody calm yourselves.
[20:26.18]I'm grabbing a drink.
[20:27.18]Two seconds.
[22:28.78]So for the purposes of this, I'm not going to just bring one down.
[22:34.16]You know what I'm saying?
[22:35.54]You got to bring like more than two.
[22:37.00]What the fuck am I doing?
[22:37.64]You got to have two down here.
[22:39.52]You know what I'm saying?
[22:45.24]Or three.
[22:46.64]I ain't going to like fucking, you know what I'm saying?
[22:49.42]Like you got to have at least two in here.
[22:51.03]There's no way it's going to work out.
[22:54.43]I ain't just bringing one.
[22:57.29]If you got them, drink them.
[23:00.65]Like that.
[23:01.15]There we go.
[23:03.53]These are siders, by the way.
[23:05.93]Just in case you were curious.
[23:12.51]There we are.

[23:19.96]Can you guys see how many fit in here?
[23:22.02]Only one and a half.

[25:05.89]Am I this drunk already?
[25:07.53]Did I fucking slam that?
[25:15.53]I must've fucking downed that, I must've fucking slammed this drink.
[25:21.17]I really don't think I, alright, whatever.
[25:27.77]I did have like four shots of vodka before the stream started, so that would make some sense.
[25:34.12]Yes, yes I did, okay, that's fine.
[25:48.30]Too hard.
[25:49.83]Okay.
[25:53.85]Ornaments!

[26:09.74]Hey!
[26:10.56]More tinsel on the tree!
[26:17.30]I don't think this is even gonna work.
[26:19.24]Where can I put this?
[26:19.93]I could go like over here with this.
[26:23.01]Right here?
[26:25.01]What do you think?
[26:27.93]I feel like up here.
[26:30.11]Maybe I can get up there.
[26:33.61]No.
[26:35.43]This fucking doll is in the way.
[26:40.39]I don't think I can use this.
[26:43.05]No?
[26:44.07]You know, let's just see what it does.
[26:44.91]I just wanna see what it does.
[26:46.90]That's all I care about.
[26:47.58]Let's see what the fucking thing does.
[26:51.30]Alright, how do I turn it on?
[26:52.18]Does this thing not even fucking work?
[26:56.78]What the fuck?
[26:59.33]How do I turn it on?
[27:00.03]I just wanna see what it does.
[27:03.09]Really?
[27:05.11]Very clearly, this is plugged in.
[27:06.33]You see that?
[27:06.71]What a fucking bust.
[27:13.46]Fuck it, whatever.
[27:14.68]I still have to do ornaments.
[27:15.54]I haven't done any fucking ornaments.
[27:22.28]Fuck this.
[27:33.09]Let's put these on too.
[27:34.45]These will fit.
[27:36.78]Hey, look at that.
[27:37.42]And they actually work.
[27:38.36]They're not a piece of shit like that.
[27:46.86]Don't ever expect it to work.
[27:52.26]These actually will go pretty good on top, I think.
[27:54.28]If I were to take a guess.
[27:59.01]How many, there's only like five?
[28:01.33]One, two, three, four, five.
[28:02.47]There's seven fucking lights here.
[28:05.15]What a disaster.
[28:06.61]Fine, go right there.
[28:07.47]Fuck off.
[28:09.81]Ornaments, ornaments.
[28:11.13]I gotta get ready for the ornaments.
[28:16.24]Let's get these ones on here.
[28:20.38]Seven fucking dollar store lights.
[28:22.08]I know, it's fucking ridiculous.
[28:25.96]Let's feed this through.
[28:26.87]These are penguin lights.
[28:29.07]See?
[28:35.55]We're gonna start hanging them.
[28:38.05]You can see that, right?
[28:38.77]No, I'll leave it there.
[28:40.45]That looks fine.
[28:42.74]We're gonna do at least four or five penguin lights.
[28:45.97]By penguin lights, I mean penguin ornaments.
[28:49.51]These all can go in different random places.
[28:53.48]You know, just imagine I'm your dad, you know?
[28:56.54]Just imagine I'm your dad.
[28:59.22]Son?
[29:00.72]Can you give me another penguin light, please?
[29:03.50]Hey, good throw.
[29:04.74]Nice catch, Dad.
[29:05.54]Thanks.
[29:07.16]I love you, son.
[29:09.34]Where's this go?
[29:12.06]You got a fucking random, like, tiara?
[29:16.98]Here.
[29:19.54]That ain't gonna work.
[29:20.22]Put this back.
[29:27.00]Fucking swear to God, I have to get these stupid ring pops off.
[29:29.82]They're ruining the whole stream.
[29:33.67]These have ruined the stream, just if you're aware.
[29:36.63]That one's rubbery.
[29:38.33]Fill here.
[29:43.49]That one fell.
[29:44.33]Hey, son!
[29:47.17]You throw another paper down there?
[29:49.05]Oh, you got it down there, son.
[29:51.71]There we are.
[29:53.81]Hey, son!
[29:56.29]Give me one of the big ones!
[29:58.45]Whoa!
[30:01.08]Good throw, son!
[30:03.64]There we are.
[30:04.22]Uh, that works.
[30:09.58]Right there.
[30:12.87]Alright, we got an ornament on the fucking tree.
[30:18.85]This one's a bear.
[30:20.17]See that?
[30:21.55]Little Teletubby.
[30:22.61]A little Teletubby bear.
[30:24.55]Put him over here.
[30:25.31]There we are.
[30:31.25]These are empty.
[30:32.07]We'll move them so they're not in the way.
[30:36.01]Drop something.
[30:39.59]I got a lot of penguins.
[30:41.15]Should I put this one on Santa?
[30:47.47]Yeah.
[30:49.29]It's kind of connected weirdly.
[30:51.19]There we go.
[30:54.32]This will go on the doll.
[30:55.66]It'll make more sense.
[30:59.42]Merry Christmas.
[31:01.16]Merry fucking Christmas, Santa.
[31:04.88]Okay.
[31:07.45]Candy cane.
[31:09.33]There we are.
[31:09.83]And these can get this out of here.
[31:15.33]This one looks good.

[32:21.44]American Eagle.

[33:03.33]Made in China.
[33:06.55]Oh shit, he fell under the tree!
[33:08.11]Not gonna fucking happen.

[33:16.02]It goes there, it's a cork, it's a cork, wine cork.
[33:19.52]It's a wine cork reindeer.
[33:23.08]Get over it.
[33:25.80]What else do I wanna do to this before I get to the next step?
[33:28.66]That looks good.
[33:33.70]I sincerely do need a fucking pair of scissors though, so.
[33:38.44]Like, honest to God, I can't do it.
[33:41.77]I have to cut this.
[33:43.25]So give me one second.
[33:45.12]Let me get fucking scissors and just just chill.
[33:48.62]Listen to the fucking music.
[33:49.52]I'll be right back.
[35:16.95]Get that over there.
[35:20.16]I don't think I even have a pair of fucking scissors in the whole house.
[35:22.58]I don't know.
[35:28.00]I don't want to, like, just fucking disappear, though.
[35:29.65]I have to do it with my fucking teeth.
[35:38.35]Somehow I've lost a ring pop.
[35:42.00]I don't know how.
[35:42.72]I don't know.
[35:46.22]Should I even use these?
[35:47.30]What else do I need to do to the fucking tree?
[35:52.80]God damn it.

[39:08.30]Why did that take so much effort?
[39:12.20]Yeah!
[39:15.46]Yeah!
[39:18.20]There was no reason for that at all.
[39:20.34]There was no reason for that.
[39:24.54]I don't know why I did that, I'm sorry.
[39:27.50]Just popped a few buttons off.
[39:29.36]We're okay.
[39:31.20]Don't worry.
[39:33.92]Look what's all over the screwdriver, can you see this?
[39:37.28]This has been covered in like Vaseline for like a week.
[39:41.80]No, when did I do the computer build stream?
[39:45.23]There's been Vaseline all over that thing for like fucking two months.
[39:48.17]Disgusting.

[39:58.11]What do you know?
[39:58.77]Hey, that's like a fucking onion!
[40:00.69]Onion!
[40:01.11]Hey, want an onion?
[40:02.55]Yes, you do!
[40:04.17]Santa, would you like an onion?
[40:05.95]Yes, you would.
[40:06.45]How about another one?
[40:07.95]Oh, dike right in the skull!
[40:09.61]Whoops-a-daisy!
[40:14.92]Fucking onion ornaments, the ones that are on sale.
[40:23.26]By the way, I need a couple of drinks, by the way.
[40:25.28]I'm gonna need another drink.
[40:28.24]And I got a couple other surprises for you boys and girls.
[40:32.66]Big surprises for you boys and girls.
[40:34.34]You don't even know what the surprise is.
[40:37.32]For all you know, the surprise could be something fucking cool.
[40:40.44]Or it might be terrible and you'll leave the stream.
[40:42.84]And for that, I'm sorry.
[40:43.92]Alright, I'm gonna come up to the camera here for a sec.
[40:49.66]Wood.
[40:50.51]Got a couple more red ones on there.
[40:55.12]That's a tree.
[40:59.58]Would you lick that for fucking 40 bucks?
[41:05.16]How about that one?
[41:09.12]Anybody got $40?
[41:11.68]You got 40 bucks?
[41:12.36]40 bucks just made it.
[41:17.76]Is this still Christmas music playing?
[41:19.34]Hey, why don't we get $40 for one of the dollar tree?
[41:25.82]Remember, I'm gonna destroy the tree.
[41:27.52]Jeremiah, every time he does a fucking IRL stream, he breaks everything and destroys his whole office, right?
[41:36.18]I just did that for you guys, because everyone's been fucking yelling at me for it.
[41:40.24]Fucking Jesus.
[41:42.52]I can't even, like, put together a IRL decorate the fucking tree stream.
[41:48.63]Everybody just expects it to be destroyed.
[41:51.37]And fix your posture, goddammit.
[41:54.43]What are you?
[41:55.33]Am I a fucking idiot?
[41:55.85]This one up here.
[41:59.98]Okay.
[42:02.44]I got a couple of more tricks up my sleeve.
[42:04.06]I want another onion.
[42:24.05]Three, two, one.
[42:25.37]I want another onion.
[42:26.29]None of this garlic bullshit.
[42:32.85]Three, two, one.
[42:35.09]I want an onion ornament.
[42:36.69]None of this garlic bullshit.
[42:43.08]Don't step on those.
[42:43.80]You'll hurt your feet.
[42:45.88]We'll do these two.
[42:46.48]Then I gotta go get the other thing that I'm working on.
[42:48.76]I got something else I'm working on.
[42:50.68]You're gonna love it.
[42:51.82]I fucking guarantee it.
[42:54.74]Put that on there.
[42:55.42]That looks alright.
[42:58.68]Trevor destroys his office on stream.
[43:01.26]No, I didn't.
[43:01.76]I just dumped a few fucking shallots on the ground.
[43:04.78]Get your facts straight.
[43:08.05]We're neglecting this side down here.
[43:09.69]There we are, right here.
[43:14.11]Looks good.
[43:14.69]It looks alright.
[43:23.94]That looks better.
[43:24.44]Get this shit out of the way.
[43:25.92]There we go.
[43:26.18]There's an onion.
[43:27.66]There's an onion.
[43:30.67]Should the onion... No, the onion's going to go right there.
[43:32.11]I don't even need a fucking hook.
[43:32.91]Alright, let me go grab the other thing.
[43:34.63]I got another thing to bring down here.
[43:36.43]Be right back.
[43:36.89]I'm going to grab a drink, too.
[43:37.67]BRB.
[43:38.54]BRB.
[43:39.18]Two seconds.

[47:01.92]We got any more out there?
[47:02.74]No, we got one more.
[47:10.41]So, as you can see, I made sure to get a red and green.
[47:15.82]Red and green, but some of these were on sale.

[47:32.43]I can't get out.
[47:34.09]Actually, I'm actually in it.
[47:36.01]I'm at a spider web.
[47:44.43]Fucking, I don't care, they're off.
[47:47.41]Is that okay up there?
[47:51.37]That's alright up there.
[47:51.99]I mean, you guys, it's blocking the lights.
[47:57.75]Three, two, one.
[48:01.49]The fuck I fucked it up.
[48:03.76]One.
[48:08.12]I just swallowed a tooth.
[48:12.46]Yeah, I just swallowed a tooth.
[48:15.02]It's gone.
[48:16.84]Last one.
[48:17.46]Here it is.
[48:21.84]Fuck me, man.
[48:22.76]Why did I get... Alright, we gotta have more tree shit.
[48:27.85]To replace a little bit of tinsel.
[48:30.95]This is a little... This is a silly strip.
[48:42.56]One.
[48:43.60]One.
[48:43.96]Don't knock that over.
[48:46.29]Let's get a little bit of a silly string.
[48:48.19]It's easy to use for tinsel.
[48:49.33]If you've never decorated a tree before, I'm a professional.
[48:57.14]Hey, Santa!
[48:58.12]How you doing, motherfucker?
[49:03.10]Yes, yes, yes.
[49:04.02]That's how you do it.
[49:05.67]Up here.
[49:12.61]Looks pretty good.
[49:14.11]Ding.
[49:15.23]Alright, now...
[49:17.34]Alright, hold on.
[49:19.10]I forgot a balloon!
[49:21.13]There's more than one balloon I forgot.
[49:23.77]I forgot a wand!
[49:26.52]Wait!
[49:48.88]It's not even a balloon.
[49:50.84]It's a Hello Kitty.
[49:52.20]What happened to this?
[49:55.03]Hello Kitty.
[49:56.43]It was literally right there.
[49:57.67]So that was fucking, that was good.
[49:59.87]That was quick and easy.
[50:03.33]We got to put this somewhere.
[50:05.41]But like right here.
[50:11.76]It's a Hello Kitty in a giraffe costume.
[50:14.46]Is that going to stay?
[50:16.30]I don't think it is.
[50:18.41]Let's put it over here.
[50:20.05]No, fuck.
[50:20.97]Get that fucking thing out of my face.
[50:22.23]Let me, um... Put that over there.
[50:27.41]Looks pretty good.
[50:30.35]Fucking goddammit.
[50:31.77]I keep forgetting shit.
[50:34.73]One last try.
[50:35.31]I didn't get a drink.
[50:36.83]Drink, drink, drink.
[50:38.13]I'll be right back.
[50:39.90]One drink.
[52:30.02]Slam it.
[52:31.72]Slam it, boys and girls.
[52:34.55]Why don't we slam it?
[52:41.15]Yes!
[52:46.71]Slam it.
[52:47.21]I'm slamming it.
[52:48.25]Sometimes you gotta slam it.
[52:49.71]Sometimes you gotta slam it.
[52:50.59]Alright, let's finish this stream up.
[53:03.50]Do I have any more ornaments?
[53:09.29]I think I have, like, at least two or three more ornaments to do.
[53:12.55]Yeah, let's get the bow.
[53:15.25]Put the bow on the tree.
[53:16.03]Oh, fuck.
[53:18.41]Shit, it's, like, fucking bent.
[53:22.53]Should the bow go on top?
[53:24.23]I think so.
[53:26.43]There we go.
[53:28.23]Perfect!
[53:30.89]Easy there.
[53:32.12]Easy.
[53:32.52]Alright.
[53:36.78]There's your tree.
[53:38.08]Merry Christmas.
[53:38.82]There it is.
[53:40.78]Get bent.
[53:43.48]Speaking of getting bent, let me go ahead and fucking end the stream the way that it should have, the way that everybody's been fucking telling me over the last three days.
[53:52.60]This fucking weird motherfucker over here.
[53:57.00]What's the number one thing people have told me to do before I end the stream?
[54:00.34]Huh?
[54:02.18]Punch him!
[54:02.78]Punch him!
[54:03.24]Punch Santa!
[54:04.00]I got a 2x4 here.
[54:09.86]Why don't we have a little fun, huh?
[54:12.89]Come on out, you fucking old fuck.
[54:15.61]Move over here.
[54:17.69]That's good.
[54:18.43]Right there, son.
[54:22.15]Oh, maybe you should fucking hit Santa!
[54:24.57]Hit Santa!
[54:26.35]With a fucking 2x4?
[54:28.07]Is that what you want to see?
[54:30.08]Before this tree, this tree is already done.
[54:32.38]So, hey, Merry fucking Christmas, everybody.
[54:34.79]Get the fuck out of here, Santa!
[54:39.71]Merry fucking Christ- It just got really cold in here.
[54:51.10]Is there anybody else cold?
[54:52.78]You guys cold?
[55:07.13]I'm fucking freezing right now.
[55:08.57]Why?
[55:08.87]What are you saying?
[55:17.65]Check the news.
[55:20.84]Check the news.
[55:21.42]What are you talking about?
[55:27.68]Check the news.
[55:29.52]Why?
[55:33.88]ladies and gentlemen we have a breaking story tonight it seems we have lost contact with Santa international law enforcement agencies are scrambling to find out what happened but our sources indicate fall play may have been involved
[55:53.59]The UN implanted the wearer in Santa and is he still alive chip back in the late 80s.
[56:00.43]The measure was put in place due to Santa's immense and often secretive travel.
[56:06.12]There have been no reports on if the chip has sent back a yes still alive ring.
[56:12.68]I mean who's gonna get me my conductor cadet 2160 train set?
[56:17.73]This is terrible, truly terrible.
[56:20.03]I hope they throw the book at whoever it was that did this.
[56:23.87]No, no, no, no.
[56:46.13]I think something killed him.
[56:47.55]I do.
[56:48.87]How hard can it be?
[56:50.51]You fire a rifle up there as he's flying by, he's only, what, 500 feet above the ground?
[56:55.94]Doesn't even need to be a gun.
[56:57.62]Somebody could have thrown a rock at him.
[56:59.52]Thank you for the call, James.
[57:01.78]I agree, honestly.
[57:04.40]Why, in the name of all that is said, would we allow a man that is this important to be flying around in what is...
[57:26.27]Thank you.
[58:02.64]Thank you.
