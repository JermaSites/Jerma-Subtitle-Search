[00:08.48]Okay, so Jerma is the red vest.
[00:11.77]I hear static.
[00:12.61]Yeah, there's a tape.
[00:15.25]Get that tape.
[00:17.79]Oh, we got it.
[00:19.93]Is that something back there?
[00:21.55]Can you guys see that?
[00:22.59]No, that's just like a tree.
[00:24.79]So the closer you get to the cassette tapes, they start buzzing and making noise and stuff, so you can find them.
[00:29.70]I feel like stealth.
[00:30.38]Is this you?
[00:30.78]This looks like you.
[00:32.94]That's not me.
[00:34.02]That's Alex.
[00:34.54]That looks like bizarro MLC_St3alth.
[00:36.86]Did you- did your series just crash?
[00:38.24]D- turn on!
[00:38.86]Turn on!
[00:39.24]Run!
[00:39.56]Run!
[00:39.84]Run!
[00:40.16]He's right behind us!
[00:41.11]He's literally right behind us!
[00:41.93]There's a giant monster in front of him!
[00:43.59]Jesus Christ!
[00:45.77]He's gone.
[00:46.67]What do you mean he's gone?
[00:47.63]No, he's not.
[00:48.41]What happens if you look at him?
[00:50.11]Is he gone?
[00:50.59]If you don't f***ing along, it's not good.
[00:53.05]Where'd he go?
[00:53.97]I don't know.
[00:54.43]Who is this?
[00:55.27]Is this Boo?
[00:55.72]Why are we all acting so nonchalant about this, by the way?
[01:00.72]Oh, I hear him growling.
[01:01.96]I see, like, another thing over here.
[01:03.42]Let's just go to the tape.
[01:05.76]There's probably a tape by this big statue.
[01:07.00]Oh, he's here again.
[01:07.82]He's here behind us again.
[01:08.88]Behind us?
[01:09.26]Don't turn around.
[01:09.78]Don't even look at him.
[01:10.81]Oh, okay.
[01:11.31]I think if you don't look at him, he moves.
[01:13.67]Yeah, he's getting closer.
[01:15.53]What do you mean?
[01:15.97]We have to look at him?
[01:16.55]Somebody has to look at him.
[01:18.75]Somebody has to look at him?
[01:19.73]He's getting a little closer.
[01:20.77]I think, is there more?
[01:21.61]Are there more of them?
[01:22.27]Are there more than one?
[01:22.97]I think it's just one.
[01:23.97]Do I have to stare at him?
[01:24.81]Are you sure I have to stare at him?
[01:26.01]You don't have to stare at him.
[01:27.06]We just, like, take turns.
[01:28.48]Don't do it for too long.
[01:30.88]We have to take turns watching him.
[01:32.50]There's a tape around here.
[01:33.98]He's right here, guys.
[01:35.32]He's seriously right behind this rock.
[01:37.60]We got a tape.
[01:39.92]We're good.
[01:40.36]We're beating the game.
[01:43.58]He's right next to us.
[01:45.66]What?
[01:45.92]Where?
[01:47.28]He really is.
[01:48.00]He's right there.
[01:49.12]Oh, dear.
[01:49.68]This guy's a chump.
[01:50.96]You know what?
[01:51.48]Where is he?
[01:53.48]Where's the attack button?
[01:55.09]Jervis is going.
[01:56.69]I'm telling you right now.
[01:57.97]I'm going to punch this guy right in his face.
[02:00.99]He's not here anymore.
[02:02.27]Oh, no, I lost everybody.
[02:03.77]Oh, no, I didn't.
[02:04.41]No, you didn't.
[02:05.49]We're, like, right next to you.
[02:07.90]By the way, we're just locking ourselves in this room, pretty much.
[02:10.28]That'll be fine.
[02:12.54]There's no cassettes in here?
[02:15.86]No, who's going to be the first one to go?
[02:17.44]Yeah, I'm not.
[02:18.12]Alright, here we go.
[02:19.52]Here we go, guys.
[02:20.80]Wish me luck.
[02:21.36]You're the first to die.
[02:24.00]Just get the grab.
[02:24.76]Okay, I think it's safe.
[02:25.86]I think we're clear.
[02:26.56]You can turn your flashlight off, by the way.
[02:29.99]Is this a cassette?
[02:31.23]I feel like it's already off.
[02:32.09]He's like back in the corner.
[02:33.71]Oh, crap.
[02:34.19]Get it.
[02:34.65]He's guarding.
[02:35.29]There you go.
[02:35.93]Nice.
[02:36.99]Okay, we got three cassettes now.
[02:39.23]Get a little fuzzy.
[02:40.67]That means we're three-eighths of the way done.
[02:44.63]Good mathematics.
[02:45.57]Alright, what percentage is three-eighths?
[02:50.39]I don't know.
[02:51.86]Like 38%.
[02:52.62]I'll give you... Somebody will know.
[02:54.28]Wow, that's not right.
[02:56.04]What is it?
[02:56.30]Am I staring at him?
[02:57.70]Why is my guy freaking out?
[02:59.62]What's that green thing?
[03:00.26]Is that a monster?
[03:00.64]I think if you sprint too much it gets easier.
[03:02.59]It's that green thing that apparently I don't like looking at.
[03:05.46]Why?
[03:05.70]Why?
[03:05.98]What's the problem?
[03:07.32]I don't know.
[03:08.92]He's behind us.
[03:09.56]Oh, he's behind us, too.
[03:10.98]Okay.
[03:11.62]I don't know where to go.
[03:12.36]I'm going this way.
[03:13.40]Let's go to the green thing.
[03:15.50]The green thing is, like, making us all screwed up.
[03:17.54]I'm not walking to the green thing.
[03:18.68]I feel like it's just a big ball of radiation or something.
[03:21.28]I know.
[03:21.54]Why is this thing, like, emitting radiation?
[03:24.06]Is anybody close to me right now?
[03:25.79]Okay.
[03:26.17]I'm, like... I'm screaming.
[03:32.21]Where did Jerva go?
[03:34.31]We lost him!
[03:35.15]I'm dead!
[03:36.70]We lost Jerva!
[03:39.58]I went to the radiation thing and he popped up in my face!
[03:43.69]Again, there's a cassette around here.
[03:44.89]Can you watch this or what's happening?
[03:46.33]Where am I?
[03:46.75]Oh, I'm a ghost.
[03:47.59]Can you guys see me?
[03:49.29]No.
[03:49.65]He's a ghost.
[03:50.03]Dude, I swear to God, I'm a ghost.
[03:52.77]Is it inside of this thing?
[03:54.01]Oh, I see you.
[03:54.83]Yeah, I see you.
[03:55.59]I'm going to come attack you guys.
[03:56.79]That's why I think I have to come kill you guys now.
[03:58.61]Oh, no.
[03:58.93]What?
[03:59.69]Oh, it's a ghost.
[04:01.85]Oh, hey.
[04:02.73]That looks really creepy.
[04:04.39]I didn't even... I can't hurt you guys?
[04:06.17]You look scary.
[04:08.09]No, you can't hurt us.
[04:08.91]What do I do?
[04:09.65]Just stick around with you guys?
[04:10.61]This is like spectator mode.
[04:11.79]Alright, hey, Etalyx, come to me.
[04:14.67]They're this way.
[04:15.99]Etalyx.
[04:16.83]Okay.
[04:17.13]Hey.
[04:17.39]I see a... No, no, no.
[04:19.09]Etalyx, this way.
[04:19.67]They went this way.
[04:20.11]You're not that way.
[04:20.87]That's where the monster is.
[04:22.23]Okay, it went this way.
[04:22.83]What are you talking about?
[04:23.75]Oh, yeah.
[04:26.12]I see the monster.
[04:28.38]Over here.
[04:28.76]Good try.
[04:29.58]Oh, he's in front of us now.
[04:31.12]There's two of them.
[04:32.20]There's two of them.
[04:32.98]There's two monsters?
[04:33.74]They're surrounded.
[04:35.92]Yes.
[04:36.94]What the fuck?
[04:39.04]Alright, Jerma's gonna follow me.
[04:40.34]I'm running.
[04:40.90]Oh, he keeps popping into view.
[04:42.60]Where's Boo?
[04:43.20]It says it's dangerous to go alone.
[04:44.78]They're about to kill me for separating.
[04:47.96]Hey, Taliesin.
[04:48.62]I found the Taliesin.
[04:49.50]Boogey, boogie, boogie, boogie.
[04:52.22]Wait, Jerma, I can't see you.
[04:53.68]You said oogie boogie.
[04:55.24]What you didn't know is the thing was right behind Odear.
[04:57.76]Oh, was he really?
[05:03.30]Oh, did you hear her scream?
[05:07.85]Yeah.
[05:08.71]What the heck?
[05:09.43]Did you die?
[05:10.23]Did you die?
[05:11.23]He was just really close.
[05:14.35]There was another one, I think, to our right.
[05:16.95]Which is what made you scream.
[05:19.78]Guys, come over here.
[05:20.98]Where's over here?
[05:22.24]Oh, yeah.
[05:22.88]What is this thing?
[05:23.94]Is this like a corpse?
[05:27.23]This is gonna kill us.
[05:28.29]Is that gonna like jump up?
[05:29.07]This is where stealth died.
[05:30.31]I don't see.
[05:31.43]What are you talking about?
[05:32.23]Oh, that's where, that's where they person died.
[05:37.17]Oh, no!
[05:38.03]Oh, they both died.
[05:40.44]Piece of crap.
[05:42.10]We just got you, just got you killed.
[05:43.88]How'd you both die instantly?
[05:46.80]Oh, look, what is this?
[05:48.28]It's like a person over here.
[05:50.12]Oh, yeah, I made it to six minutes and ten seconds.
[05:53.91]Good job, Jerma.
[05:55.09]Double, double the, oh.
