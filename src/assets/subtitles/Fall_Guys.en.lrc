[06:15.53]Alright, I'm ready to go.

[06:21.86]Your one day game is over.
[06:23.42]See you tomorrow.
[06:26.66]Stop.

[06:43.25]46 out of 60.
[06:43.99]That's it.
[06:44.27]Do people not know it's back up?
[06:50.61]Alright.
[06:54.35]Now I understand.
[07:03.13]So is this randomized?
[07:05.04]Or is it the same one every time?

[08:16.85]First place.
[08:18.81]What did I say?
[08:21.25]I was looking for 10th.
[08:50.40]When you're number one, you just sit back and just watch the rest of them just try.
[08:54.79]Don't worry.
[08:59.27]I'll be down there next round.
[09:12.14]Who's next?

[12:08.78]Oh, right in the middle?
[12:11.26]I'm thinking just... I'm thinking 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[12:13.82]Just count.
[12:14.82]Start at 1.
[12:18.36]Just go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

[13:04.50]Just do it.
[13:04.90]Like jump.
[13:05.30]Jump into the end zone.
[13:20.07]It's because I walked in the wrong one.
[13:21.27]I went right to the left side and it instantly put me in last place.
[13:24.75]Am I stuck here?
[13:35.62]I walked right to the first wall.
[13:38.44]What the hell?
[13:39.04]Uh-oh.
[13:42.68]I'm stuck.
[13:46.88]You were so bad that the lobby broke.

[16:13.46]Oh, Jesus.
[16:14.16]The whole thing turns.
[16:15.62]We can't all go on the left side.

[16:17.66]Don't dump me.
[16:26.57]Balance it out first.
[16:28.63]Oh, shit.

[17:42.62]Do you grab people?
[17:44.32]How do you grab people?
[17:50.92]R2?
[17:52.50]That's kind of mean.
[17:53.31]This is the guy that was doing it.
[18:08.10]Depending on your preference.
[18:09.18]Oh, okay.
[18:13.46]I don't think this guy even... This is just like such a seasoned veteran.
[18:16.70]He's just kind of walking around.
[18:17.94]The worst game is Slime Game.
[18:23.93]So many people get knocked out.
[18:26.75]We'll see if we find it.
[18:30.76]You have to grab some ledges.
[18:32.34]How do you pull yourself up?
[18:34.26]If I jump and hold R2, will I automatically do it or just hold up?
[18:38.55]Or do I have to keep holding R2?
[18:39.57]Move between rotating rings to avoid falling into the slime.
[18:51.16]This is what you were talking about?
[19:00.09]Alright, come on, let's go.
[19:03.74]Avoid the slime.
[19:11.70]That's slime right there, isn't it?
[19:12.60]Can I touch the donuts?
[19:17.34]Where's this next slime?
[19:23.92]Oh shit, this is gonna make me throw up.
[19:25.26]Okay, um... I'm good.
[19:27.40]This one's going wicked fast, why?
[19:31.54]Slime incoming.
[19:33.20]Slime.
[19:33.49]I just jumped into a slime.
[19:34.39]Slime over there.
[19:34.87]Go back.
[19:40.73]Do they just keep going?
[19:41.61]Get off me!
[19:45.01]Oh, I'm just trying to kill a guy.
[19:56.21]Oh, shit.
[19:57.23]Oh, shit.
[19:57.75]Oh, shit!
[20:05.33]How many more?
[20:06.79]No, you motherfucker!
[20:20.66]I deserved it.
[20:21.30]I know, because I'm trying to push people off the edge.
[20:23.84]I was trying to push people off the edge.
[20:27.03]I deserve it.
[20:31.39]Why did I do that?
[20:39.95]I was right about to qualify for round three.
[20:52.92]I'm going to have trouble in this game because I can't pay attention for more than one consecutive round.
[20:59.14]I will try as hard as I can on two rounds in a row.
[21:01.84]And then by the third round, I'll start talking to you guys about like an animal I saw in the backyard yesterday.
[21:07.59]And it'll be over.
[21:24.18]And your username to improve matchmaking?
[21:26.02]What do you mean?
[21:29.06]Alright, obstacles.
[21:34.02]It's just the obstacles.
[21:35.03]Watch out.
[21:35.57]This one's kind of short.
[21:42.89]Alright, I'm... That's going to be really hard up there.
[21:46.41]Alright, I'm ready.
[21:50.01]What animal was it?
[21:51.65]It was a chickadee.
[21:55.47]It was eating a bug.
[21:56.95]That one's spinning.
[22:04.84]I fucking threw that guy off.
[22:13.30]That was mean.
[22:18.66]No, don't get wedged in.
[22:25.09]Y'all can't go in at the same time.
[22:26.73]Wait, all those people just got screwed?
[22:36.85]Are they done?
[22:54.36]Birds just pretend to be real.
[22:56.61]What?
[22:58.23]To be spied on?
[23:02.07]Birds aren't real?
[23:03.05]They're just robots?
[23:08.51]Birds are spy cams.
[23:12.38]So what are the eggs?
[23:17.75]Because you don't, like, you don't, like, leave two Logitech cameras together and then come back in a few months and there's six of them.
[23:26.23]I don't know how that works.
[23:37.16]Wait.
[23:38.12]Use RT to grab a tail?
[23:39.38]I don't even know what that said.
[23:40.56]I'm going to instantly eliminate.
[23:42.47]Make sure that your team has more tails than the rest of the... What do you mean, tail?
[23:46.55]We're on teams?
[23:50.22]We have to grab tails.
[23:51.86]Whose tail?
[23:53.16]Our tails?
[23:53.82]Their tails?
[23:54.54]You got it.
[23:54.94]Got it!
[24:00.14]What?
[24:02.48]I don't understand.
[24:17.88]What do I get?
[24:18.30]Do I get a tail back?
[24:21.82]Get his tail.
[24:27.37]Golden tails.
[24:28.25]Oh, you mean this guy right here.
[24:53.51]That's a good strategy just just go by the mallet I Need it we I need to have a
[25:19.30]What?
[25:19.52]I didn't get it?
[25:21.32]We only have three tails with 30 seconds left.
[25:23.14]Go get another one.
[25:28.15]We got five.
[25:28.65]Alright, I gotta protect this guy.
[25:30.39]Hey, that's me.
[25:34.01]That's my guy.
[25:43.08]Give me that tail!
[25:46.20]Oh, come on!
[25:53.69]No, it's us!
[25:54.81]It's us!
[25:55.65]Fuck!
[25:56.61]This game's so hard!
[26:11.05]Aw, that was my fucking teammate.
[26:12.17]My fucking teammates couldn't do anything.
[26:13.51]They fucking weren't grabbing tails and everything.
[26:16.71]I had a tail for like ten seconds.
[26:17.87]None of my fucking teammates had a tail for more than fucking one second, dude.
[26:29.16]Toxic.
[26:36.10]You immediately gave your... Yeah, but I didn't even know how the game worked.
[26:43.82]You need to smash the PC in rage.
[26:52.61]I don't think this is a rage game.
[26:58.41]I think this is a sit with your feet up on the couch with a bowl of pretzels on your crotch.
[27:05.97]Just eating and just like kind of giggling every few minutes.
[27:17.48]I'm not sure this is a rage game.
[27:20.96]Although, we'll see.
[27:24.64]Are you watching a stoner comedy?
[27:50.37]No!
[27:50.75]There's too many people in the way.
[28:10.95]I gotta go up the middle, I have to.
[28:12.65]Get off of me!
[28:13.99]Go back to fucking Rugrats!
[28:30.70]He's just trying to push people off of the edge.
[28:32.66]And that is what made you downfall.
[28:34.28]Now I'm in first place.
[28:35.52]You put him one.
[28:39.72]Does that matter at all, by the way?
[28:47.81]It doesn't matter at all, as long as you qualify.
[28:49.39]Okay.
[28:51.11]So that's why people are standing at the edge and just pushing every single Zarya motherfucker that comes over here.
[28:55.89]They're just pushing them off the edge because they just want to make sure they lose in the first round.
[28:59.86]Okay.
[29:00.38]Okay.
[29:09.53]I want Slurpee Guy to make it.
[29:11.73]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[29:24.68]How many rounds are there?
[29:26.14]Three?
[29:29.74]You get more points the better that you do.
[29:31.20]There are five.
[29:32.04]Oh boy.
[29:34.36]Come on.
[29:34.90]I've got to do this.
[29:37.67]Oh, not this one.
[29:38.37]I hate this one.
[29:39.52]Wait, no, I like, okay, this is, I, I fucked this one up last time.
[29:42.02]I'm not gonna mess it up this time.
[29:47.62]The idea is to just memorize where two of them are.
[29:50.00]So, I'm only gonna memorize where the cherries and the grapes are.
[29:57.19]I have to look at it from the same angle.
[29:58.27]Okay, two, cherry, cherry on here.
[30:01.95]Cherry, two cherries in the corner.
[30:04.41]Bananas.
[30:05.15]Right there.
[30:05.43]I know where the cherries are.
[30:07.54]I know where the cherries are, and I know there's two, but I... Wait.
[30:11.78]This is the last one you see?
[30:13.06]What does it want us to do?
[30:15.82]Cherry?
[30:16.64]I'm safe right here.
[30:24.12]I was an asshole, and I'm about to pay for it.
[30:25.70]Don't do that.
[30:26.76]I was kidding.
[30:27.21]Alright.
[30:28.63]Looking for a watermelon.
[30:29.57]Don't touch me.
[30:30.79]Okay.
[30:33.51]Grapes.
[30:35.05]Don't do it.
[30:37.23]Okay, I don't know.
[30:37.77]Okay, watermelon grape.
[30:38.43]I know where the grapes and I know where the watermelons are.
[30:40.63]I don't know where anything else is.
[30:42.58]Oh, no.
[30:43.26]Okay, I think it's over here.
[30:46.90]What?
[30:49.76]Okay.
[30:57.47]It's cherries, apples, and bananas.
[31:00.41]I mean, blueberries.
[31:01.55]I don't know.
[31:03.19]Okay, I know where the apples are and I know where the oranges are.
[31:08.63]Wait, is this an orange or is this an apple?
[31:10.39]The apple's in the corner.
[31:20.46]Finally, I made it to the third round.
[31:23.80]First time I've ever been to the third round.
[31:32.84]That doesn't eliminate very many people.
[31:34.24]There's still 30 people.
[31:45.77]Oh no, not this again.
[31:46.79]Oh, wait.
[31:48.15]Jump and dive through hoops to score points for your team.
[31:51.23]I should be pretty good at this.
[31:52.19]I have to dive through the hoops.
[31:55.15]Alright, I'm going to do so well here.
[31:57.49]Watch this shit.
[32:02.92]Yellow team is about to have like 10 to 15 points.
[32:10.59]I didn't know it did that.
[32:13.39]Alright, let's go.
[32:20.46]I'm going to go up here.
[32:31.38]Huh?
[32:32.80]I didn't get that one?
[32:33.62]How?
[32:34.04]What?
[32:48.13]I'm staying over here.
[32:51.25]I'm gonna get this one.
[32:51.97]I'm gonna get this one.
[32:52.45]I'm gonna get this one.
[32:54.05]It's alright.
[32:54.39]I got it, buddy.
[32:57.77]God, that's a double.
[33:02.61]Don't even go for it.
[33:03.41]You're not going to... Good.
[33:11.37]Law it over this way.
[33:12.05]Fucking asshole.
[33:20.49]I had that one.
[33:25.51]No, we're fine.
[33:26.61]Hey, right here.
[33:30.33]I'm going to spawn right here.
[33:38.45]37.
[33:38.53]They're coming back, though.
[33:39.53]This is not good.
[33:43.57]38, 31.
[33:43.61]20 seconds.
[33:44.93]Anything can happen in 20 seconds.
[33:52.18]No!
[33:52.54]Why is Brit so good?
[33:53.58]No, they're not coming back.
[33:58.90]38.
[33:58.92]43, 38.
[34:01.70]There we go.
[34:03.32]Blue team gone.
[34:12.42]That was total zone control, was it?
[34:19.48]Damn, now we're down to 20.
[34:20.36]Okay.
[34:20.88]This is where it gets interesting.
[34:29.91]Zoned.
[34:35.19]Work together to push your ball to the finish line before the other team.
[34:41.35]Oh no.
[34:43.07]Okay.
[34:44.29]Okay, I get it.
[34:49.89]I'm on blue team.
[34:51.13]So I'm gonna go on the right side.
[34:53.87]Just be gentle.
[34:56.45]Honestly, this really should be like two people doing this.
[35:05.76]Actually not doing that bad.
[35:09.88]Alright, somebody has to sacrifice themselves to get it up here.
[35:16.94]Turn it, turn it, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[35:18.38]Good.
[35:19.66]Keep going this way.
[35:21.48]Weave it, weave it, weave it.
[35:23.94]Don't push it backwards, weave it.
[35:24.94]It's not gonna fit through there.
[35:30.00]Oh no, oh no.
[35:33.17]We're fighting each other.
[35:34.69]Just go, oh no, we're gonna lose.
[35:41.31]Get it down the hill.
[35:42.71]What are you doing?
[35:47.95]Wait, it's these guys.
[35:49.87]They're infiltrating us.
[35:53.25]We win.
[35:56.41]Uh-oh, who's going to get eliminated?
[36:06.59]No, it's going to be red.
[36:12.27]Reds was stuck?
[36:13.37]Is that why they kept on infiltrating?
[36:20.24]13 remain.
[36:20.72]Is this the last event?
[36:22.96]Okay, I gotta play well here.
[36:31.80]What's the last event?
[36:37.27]Four pieces fall away when you stand on them.
[36:39.05]Keep moving and survive longest to win the crown.
[36:43.31]What?
[36:45.27]So don't step on any pieces.
[36:51.25]Oh shit, but what about these ones?
[36:53.91]I'm gonna stay up on the- I gotta- I have a plan.
[37:07.39]I got a plan.
[37:11.97]Just do it very slowly.
[37:23.22]You can have your own spot, I don't care.
[38:06.75]I saw him coming from my peripheral and it fucking freaked me out.
[38:18.22]He sprinted by.
[38:19.46]He was just being an asshole.
[38:20.83]He was just trying to dump all the... I could have been up top still.
[38:24.79]Oh, I had it.
[38:26.33]I was in fifth place.
[38:28.13]Oh, damn it.
[38:31.41]It's just these two.
[38:32.77]It's this guy.
[38:33.41]That's the guy that ran across and just was cutting everybody off.
[38:40.46]He wins?
[38:47.83]The guy that's made it a brain matter.
[38:49.18]Hey, good job, Fallguy3854.
[38:51.68]I think he's level two.
[39:01.76]Ooh.
[39:02.74]I got bubble gum.
[39:08.92]Sure, put it on.
[39:17.20]You're doing really well.
[39:19.22]I thought I could stay up top.
[39:21.96]I was one of two people up top, and then I fell, and my dumb idiot brain didn't realize that all the other layers were going to be just ripped apart.
[39:30.39]I don't know why I was thinking, oh, I'll be up here for a little while.
[39:33.79]I fell through four layers.
[39:46.73]You gotta be Pickle Rick.
[39:49.39]No, I'm going... This is cotton candy.
[39:53.75]Aren't these my colors?
[39:58.56]Where's my chin?
[39:59.04]Well, I'm more green.
[40:10.82]A little more green.
[40:15.90]Bad idea to go to the middle one.
[40:17.14]Told you.
[40:20.25]You can be a hot dog.
[40:21.31]All kinds of different food, condiments and stuff.
[40:23.29]This is awesome.
[40:29.47]That was bullshit.
[40:33.64]Oh, and I did a front flip too.
[40:53.78]Get in there, get in there.
[40:54.87]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[40:55.93]Don't just go.
[40:57.55]I don't care.
[40:58.37]Oh, no.
[41:04.22]Who's the last one?
[41:06.88]Oh, not you.
[41:09.33]Not you.
[41:23.60]39?
[41:25.79]So what is the most eliminated round?
[41:29.32]1?
[41:29.66]Or like 3?
[41:52.47]I think this is the thing everybody hated.
[42:05.92]Qualified one?
[42:06.94]Okay, I was gonna say only one fucking person qualifies?
[42:09.42]Holy shit, I was trying to be dick.
[42:16.43]I'm gonna take this slow.
[42:18.79]Wait, good idea!
[42:21.03]It's a bad idea, let's do it the right way.
[42:24.73]Watch it.
[42:35.14]Wait, there's a secret over here.
[42:38.16]No there's not.
[42:45.69]This is like too many people to jump.
[42:57.39]Whoa, they bounced backwards.
[42:58.53]I'm good.
[43:04.08]You had to jump at the exact same time, didn't you?
[43:06.68]You had to do that, didn't you?
[43:08.48]Why did we both do it at the exact same time?
[43:13.42]Beep.
[43:41.94]The guy was just like standing there.
[43:43.68]Oh, I can be Patrick.
[43:49.01]Yeah, I'm being Patrick.
[44:02.04]Your pretzels would be everywhere right now.
[44:03.74]No, no, no.
[44:04.16]I would make sure that the integrity of the pretzels was completely and totally sound.
[44:16.61]Patrick impression?
[44:17.57]Okay.
[44:20.64]Uh, SpongeBob?
[44:22.34]What's that supposed to mean?
[44:23.38]I don't understand.
[44:27.18]That'll be $100, please.
[44:34.06]Don't do that.
[44:38.15]Is this a PS4 exclusive?
[44:39.33]Nah, this is a PC.
[44:52.67]Down with the losers.
[44:53.81]Great.
[44:57.87]Oh shit, there's a naked Patrick.
[44:59.45]I have to be aware that I'm not the naked Patrick.
[45:01.87]I'm regular pant Patrick.
[45:16.77]Fuck, I get hit by reverse upside down ball Patrick.
[45:38.88]Sen's Fortress?
[45:39.66]Yeah, it kind of is like Sen's Fortress.
[45:45.02]Okay, does the hot dog soup cost like $7?
[45:47.44]No.
[46:00.98]You can earn it.
[46:01.64]Okay, that's cool.
[46:04.80]Is it going to choose?
[46:05.44]It wants to choose something.
[46:10.13]I don't think it's... It might be locked out.
[46:12.73]Oh, okay.
[46:18.19]Alright, now I know what this is.
[46:20.59]I'm going to be very, very, very serious.
[46:23.39]You know what that means?
[46:24.09]I'm going to go to the corner.
[46:25.03]I'm going to put myself in the corner and back my tail into the wall and no one will touch me for the entire game.
[46:39.75]But I don't have a tail.
[46:44.88]Get away from him.
[46:47.74]You're not gonna touch him.
[46:54.37]We have four, okay?
[46:55.65]I'm occupying one of their premium content players.
[47:03.51]Did he get it?

[48:27.24]You didn't touch my back.
[48:35.11]Oh, it doesn't matter.
[48:35.97]You just have to grab the person?
[48:38.37]Oh.
[48:39.53]I thought you had to, like, grab their tail.
[48:43.51]I was going to say, now I get why I couldn't cheese it.
[48:46.14]Okay.
[48:50.80]I'm trying to grab their tails.

[60:00.90]Alright.
[60:01.94]I made up all the time I lost.
[60:04.25]It's not red on the outside.
[60:05.71]It's red on the inside.
[60:06.85]If you smashed me in the head with a mallet, maybe I would open up and be red.
[60:10.39]Just follow it.
[60:20.56]Don't fight it.
[60:21.10]Just follow it.
[60:29.94]Had his hands out, and he was like, I'm gonna get you, you asshole.
[60:37.48]What?
[60:38.80]What happened?
[60:40.94]It was a jump!
[60:41.88]I had to jump over that?
[60:43.10]Don't fall through the little bug crack there, please.
[60:50.78]I can't get eliminated in the first round.
[60:52.58]You know what I mean?
[60:53.54]Like, I can't.
[60:54.12]I was too busy looking up watermelons.
[60:59.24]Whatever.
[61:12.97]Alright, let's go.
[61:15.48]This game is so addicting because I just want to win one, but it's probably never going to happen.
[61:20.02]That's how they keep you here.
[61:23.06]You desperately want to just win one time, but it's probably not going to happen.
[61:29.79]You'll come close, but you'll never win.
[61:32.39]I think that's just the BR marketing scheme.
[61:38.29]just make people come really really close to winning every single time but they never do so they keep you there it's gambling yeah it's like you're sitting at a slot machine you you put in like 10 bucks you lose five you win 10 you lose four you win two you lose eight you win it's just a slot machine
[62:17.22]Alright, which one?
[62:18.74]I'm going in the middle.
[62:20.12]Nope.
[62:20.78]Nope.
[62:22.49]Oh, shit.
[62:27.09]I didn't think it was going to be real.
[62:29.29]Alright, right.
[62:30.71]This one.
[62:31.95]Alright, we just have to qualify.
[62:39.63]Who cares?
[62:41.33]Just qualify.
[62:42.12]It don't matter.
[62:46.76]42 of us all in the same spot.
[62:48.26]It's just who's lucky enough to walk by first.
[62:55.38]It's Black Friday.
[63:03.39]Oh, that's funny.
[63:12.93]Another watermelon.
[63:14.15]Pog.
[63:23.17]I have to win one of these.
[63:25.85]Keep your balls in your area to earn points.
[63:27.97]Keep... So we have to keep our balls in.
[63:29.75]Our area.
[63:36.18]So... So the goal... Okay, I'm going to be on offense.
[63:38.06]This is just a game of soccer.
[63:39.04]I'm going to go on offense and I'm going to go like... I'm going to go drop kick the goalie.
[63:42.26]Okay, here we go.
[63:43.10]Ready?
[63:43.80]I'm going to get red ball.
[63:45.68]This red, they don't expect like three of us to come get red.
[63:47.72]Yeah, they didn't expect that.
[63:58.70]I got him.
[63:59.06]Just keep it over here.
[63:59.92]I'm going to go get a blue ball.
[64:01.80]Or a red one.
[64:02.30]Blue.
[64:03.48]No.
[64:03.88]There's nobody over here.
[64:04.80]There's a red one right here.
[64:07.12]I'm going for this one.
[64:07.70]There's only two people on red.
[64:08.64]Two people on yellow.
[64:09.31]Let's go for it.
[64:13.07]On the side.
[64:13.73]Side.
[64:14.15]Side.
[64:14.85]Side.
[64:15.49]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[64:16.61]On the side.
[64:24.93]Good.
[64:25.13]Keep it going.
[64:27.60]Excellent.
[64:28.20]Okay, they don't have any.
[64:33.78]I just feel like I'm playing risky.
[64:36.40]We play with three or four friends and one of them instantly just hates the whole game and is destroyed.
[64:41.78]Like, yeah, dude, you picked Australia and I came over from Europe and fucking just wiped you out.
[64:49.26]And now you have to watch us have to spend the next four hours trying to fight each other.
[64:58.70]Although late game, having that Australia zone, that's two units every round.
[65:05.54]That's a strategic location to have at risk.
[65:07.88]No one's even paying attention to me.
[65:11.43]We're gonna get it fucking eliminated.
[65:15.09]Hi, it's Ty!
[65:16.91]I mean, over time.
[65:25.95]How did Red get all these?
[65:34.12]What happened?
[65:50.10]You were too busy talking?
[65:52.67]We're just running into each other.
[65:58.63]Last time I checked, guys, you don't play the game of chess by you smushing all of your pieces into all of my pieces.
[66:06.72]And whoever has more pieces on the board in 30 seconds wins the game.
[66:23.41]That's how you play chess.
[66:31.13]It's actually like a really annoying place to have.
[66:36.56]You put your troops on that that little zone there.
[66:40.76]It's so impossible.
[66:41.70]You just put like 500 units right in the entrance.
[66:44.26]You just have Australia the whole time.
[66:48.48]I gotta get to like the top 10 again.
[66:53.38]Last game is so nerve-wracking.
[66:56.62]When are they gonna have the DLC where I can just pay to be in the final 10?
[67:01.74]You know, when are they going to invent the Disney Fast Pass of this game?
[67:07.18]It's like, oh, 13 people have been eliminated, and we've got one that just joined.
[67:11.70]The Fall Guy Fast Pass.
[67:14.91]You'd be hated.
[67:15.41]Everyone would just gang up on you and get rid of you.
[67:31.30]It's impossible to do this.
[67:40.86]DNQ did not qualify in the first round.
[67:44.64]Unless somebody does something real dumb.
[67:46.80]Like that guy.
[67:47.76]The guy that you just watched.
[67:49.02]Yeah, like, dude, you and me get it.
[67:51.02]We get it.
[67:51.62]Like, we're the only two that aren't gonna qualify.
[67:53.31]We'll just be a fruit salad together.
[67:55.05]Is this guy disconnected?
[68:08.21]Oh, he's back.
[68:14.07]How is this still possible?
[68:16.05]Why is it still going?
[68:24.32]Wait, I just have to beat the pineapple guy?
[68:31.20]You're throwing for views.
[68:32.44]No, I got trapped in that windmill.
[68:41.98]I could have made it, I just was sitting there talking to the pineapple guy and he freaked out.
[68:45.58]You know what probably happened?
[68:47.62]The guy was probably sleeping.
[68:49.45]In his chair with his pretzels on his crotch and he was just hanging out, just stoned.
[68:53.89]And when I grabbed him, his controller vibrated and he freaked out.
[69:03.52]What happened?
[69:03.96]Whoa, whoa!
[69:05.48]Oh shit.
[69:08.62]It's just drool is all over the side of his mouth.
[69:13.04]And embarrassingly, he looks over and there's a puddle of just wetness right next to his head and he just fucking puts a blanket on it.
[69:18.93]I don't want anyone to see that.
[69:19.87]It's embarrassing.
[69:40.37]I am going to qualify this time.
[69:42.21]I'm going to just be quiet and play.
[69:48.86]Quiet.
[69:49.28]Dude.
[69:51.62]No.
[69:51.80]You're putting too much weight on it.
[70:09.41]Why don't we just all keep... Look at the whole... There's a bunch of people waiting for this to come down, but we just keep ruining it.
[70:14.96]We just keep making it too low.
[70:20.56]No!
[70:21.18]Don't do it.
[70:22.42]Okay.
[70:37.45]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not yet.
[70:38.60]Okay, go now.
[70:43.63]Are you trying to kill us?
[70:44.45]Only 10 people have made it so far.
[70:53.51]Is this penis music?
[71:10.10]I hate that I get it now.
[71:13.06]You know what I'm saying?
[71:13.84]I hate that I get it.
[71:17.58]Penis music.
[71:18.40]I'm not supposed to get that.
[71:24.39]I'm trying to drag this guy over the finish line so he stops doing this.
[71:43.06]Alright, man.
[71:43.72]Like... You don't have to build a farm.
[71:48.52]Like, all the way in the corner of the map.
[71:51.20]For the longest.
[71:51.74]I already took your castle.
[71:54.22]Nobody gets that shit?
[72:02.32]Oh, nobody played Warcraft 3 online back in, like, 2002.
[72:04.66]I forgot.
[72:19.38]he's too old I want the soda can one oh I hate this one I mean you could just ask the audience and just go to where most people are standing but sometimes the audience gets it wrong
[72:51.57]thing?
[72:51.81]Like eating... Alright, I know where the... Man, they're right there.
[72:55.32]This is right, right?
[73:03.40]Come on, dude.
[73:05.38]Come on.
[73:06.64]Why push him off?
[73:07.86]Why push him off?
[73:08.70]That was so... That wasn't even called for.
[73:10.44]That guy's probably so sad right now.
[73:12.59]He got it right and he lost.
[73:13.75]Alright.
[73:17.21]Oranges, watermelons.
[73:18.53]Okay, orange, watermelon, banana.
[73:20.79]I know where they are.
[73:26.01]There was a cherry?
[73:29.19]I'm on the edge.
[73:32.13]I don't like being on the edge.
[73:32.95]Okay.
[73:43.05]Alright, what is it?
[73:45.57]Cherry, banana, orange, watermelon, cherry, banana, orange, watermelon, cherry, banana, orange, watermelon, cherry.
[73:50.62]Does it weigh the grapes?
[74:02.19]I don't think anybody lost.
[74:12.21]Oh, that guy did.
[74:24.92]Oh, yeah, that's the guy.
[74:25.84]We would have all made it, but somebody pushed him off the edge.
[74:30.35]And that motherfucker was on camera.
[74:31.66]You know, we saw it happen.
[74:35.46]Alright, this is the egg one.
[74:36.56]I don't like this one.
[74:37.30]It's too long.
[74:40.17]I'm going right for a gold egg though.
[75:00.05]Get that golden egg, please!
[75:02.79]Good, nice.
[75:03.51]Nice work.
[75:15.04]I'll take that egg from you.
[75:16.64]No, just defend.
[75:22.28]What?
[75:23.10]Holy shit, another golden goose.
[75:29.23]Block.
[75:30.05]The game of football.
[75:30.73]That's all this is.
[75:39.44]Don't let him get back at you.
[75:49.28]Oh, shit.
[75:49.89]That guy just had... He just gave them like 10 points.
[76:04.36]Get it in there.
[76:05.76]Nice work.
[76:10.16]Hmm.
[76:11.61]Look at that.
[76:14.61]Blue can take it.
[76:15.17]Blue has nothing.
[76:17.57]Okay, I'm alright with this.
[76:18.69]Just defend.
[76:19.09]Get that D. Get that D. The D. The D. They're going to try to get out and just fucking stomp them.
[76:36.16]Oh, completely unguarded.
[76:37.28]This is a mistake.
[76:44.06]Defense genius.
[76:52.16]Defensive genius.
[76:53.29]What's up?
[76:53.59]Sorry.
[76:58.51]Alright, we got two more, right?
[77:01.37]I gotta beat one of these.
[77:04.51]You can throw eggs by diving, letting go.
[77:06.20]Uh, yeah.
[77:13.72]Don't choke.
[77:14.24]Depends on what this is.
[77:16.28]Fruit.
[77:16.54]Shoot.
[77:16.78]Dodge the flying fruit.
[77:17.68]Okay.
[77:22.32]You got to pick a side and just commit to dodging and not try to be first.
[77:50.40]Alright, I was already down.
[77:51.18]I had damage mitigation.
[77:56.29]Pretty good dodge right there.
[77:58.25]See that little shimmy?
[77:58.91]No!
[78:01.73]I got hit by a fucking plumb!
[78:14.61]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[78:22.73]Yes.
[78:25.71]Spent right by him.
[78:39.85]He moved out with worse noise.
[78:44.50]That was a car.
[78:45.24]I don't know.
[78:49.18]I'm ready to win.
[78:50.12]This is the last event.
[78:51.00]I gotta win.
[78:51.70]Alright.
[78:52.28]Super Mountain.
[78:53.56]I hate this shit.
[78:54.20]Someone's always better than you.
[78:56.67]The number one rule of VR is somebody's always better than you.
[79:00.57]No matter what.
[79:01.25]There's always three people better than you in every game.
[79:16.89]Watch out for those balls, there's one coming,
[79:45.16]No!
[79:48.40]I'm never going to win.
[79:49.14]You can't win.
[79:51.22]There's no winning in this game.
[79:52.92]You don't win.
[79:53.56]There's no winning.
[79:54.30]Somebody's always going to be in first place in front of you.
[79:56.68]This is the carrot on a stick.
[80:05.19]They make sure the carrot's still there.
[80:07.35]So you buy a bunch of fucking kudos bars.
[80:12.25]Wait, I got a crown.
[80:22.44]Oh, shit.
[80:24.84]I want it.
[80:25.14]What can I do with the crown?
[80:31.35]Stealthy.
[80:32.53]Ooh.
[80:37.23]Boxer?
[80:42.14]I'm gonna save my crown.
[80:43.54]I don't want... Yeah, I'm saving the crown.
[80:46.10]Let's go put this on, though.
[80:46.78]Okay, what do I get?
[80:48.92]Upper.
[80:50.20]Yes.
[80:50.48]Alright, I need to change to my favorite colors.
[80:55.01]The Boston Red Sox.
[81:11.44]Whatever.
[81:27.68]Alright, that's fine.
[81:29.26]No pattern.
[81:29.74]I'm just going to be, yeah, I'm going to be pink.
[81:35.38]Finally, I can stand out.
[81:36.94]That's like Peter Griffin.
[81:50.65]I'm stopping doing that.
[82:04.29]anytime you go like that's Peter Griffin doing a funny song I can't do that for 10kp yeah there are holy there are 10k people here hey you think I'll be able to beat this new Fall Guys or do I have to come back and do this tomorrow and try to win before I do anything else in my entire life
[82:34.86]They're keeping me in the casino.
[82:45.56]I have to win.
[82:55.71]No one is as unique as me.
[82:57.45]Alright, stop trying to go up
[83:07.08]I was waiting, too.
[83:08.28]I was waiting.
[83:09.48]And I didn't even get it.
[83:10.56]Now I'm stuck forever.
[83:23.03]Ow.
[83:26.53]I'm actually not in a bad spot somehow.
[83:30.18]I just got destroyed.
[83:31.04]Alright, I'm not going up the middle.
[83:32.84]I have to be safe.
[83:44.82]I was just in the road.
[83:55.69]Oh my fucking god.
[83:56.75]I'm so mad right now.
[83:59.17]We were all waiting at the bus stop and for some reason I was waiting on the road and we were at the highway.
[84:07.58]I still did it. 36...
[84:12.17]That guy right there, that chocolate mint sprinkles guy is probably so mad that he didn't go over.
[84:17.81]He was making it his job to fuck everybody up.
[84:32.47]That dude just had both hands over and over again.
[84:34.73]He's just smashing his fucking desk over and over again.
[84:38.11]Both hands.
[84:54.67]Projecting Too many too many
[85:14.11]Only 30 people can qualify.
[85:15.45]This is not good.
[85:16.11]Uh, no.
[85:20.14]Oh, now what?
[85:22.04]We have to go to the... How do we do this?
[85:24.54]Do we just lose?
[85:26.28]Stop doing it.
[85:27.64]I'm going the other way.
[85:29.24]I'm going the other way.
[85:30.00]You guys are stupid waiting for the bus.
[85:33.60]The bus is always going to come on this side.
[85:36.02]Yeah, yeah, look at that.
[85:36.94]Everybody's like, oh, wait, maybe we should do that too.
[85:46.93]Oi!
[85:49.08]What did that do?
[85:49.46]Why is this- Why am I- Why do I have a cursor on me?
[85:54.80]Why am I selected?
[85:55.46]Is somebody about to drop a nuke on me?
[85:59.57]I don't understand.
[86:00.29]What's this for?
[86:05.21]Oh no!
[86:30.63]What's the... Excuse me.
[86:32.75]They all just spawned on top of me.
[86:36.02]Oh, come on.
[86:38.14]It's too slippery and we can't do it.
[86:39.80]Right in the middle.
[86:52.45]Ooh, that just saved me.
[86:59.56]Is this six of us?
[87:06.60]Really liked getting telefragged by eight people that all respawned in front of me.
[87:24.77]Slam desk with both hands and fucking screams.
[87:48.68]Etzels are everywhere.
[87:58.63]CBD!
[88:01.25]Sniffy, shut up.
[88:03.36]Nobody listen to that guy.
[88:05.12]He's a liar and he's just trying to fucking mess with me and he's trying to defame me.
[88:08.94]First round's always not the worst.
[88:23.15]Always the easiest.
[88:23.85]How can they all be like this?
[88:40.87]Why did I fall?
[88:41.67]I was just running.
[88:42.83]I don't have to be dumb.
[88:51.80]Why are these people all getting thrown over here?
[88:53.92]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[89:05.71]Funny.
[89:06.25]Target the streamer.
[89:07.23]That wicked funny.
[89:08.93]Yeah, of course, right?
[89:10.95]Yup, says jermaOn a 5 up there.
[89:12.39]Yeah, grab me.
[89:12.93]Target the streamer.
[89:27.44]Nobody can even tell who is who, right?
[89:31.04]Doesn't even say your name.
[89:32.54]I know.
[89:43.17]This might sound really weird.
[89:44.53]Don't you want to see these people?
[89:50.48]This is the greatest compilation box of Jelly Bellies ever.
[90:03.94]And by the way, what happened to jelly?
[90:05.28]Jelly bellies could have really, really stepped a game up.
[90:08.28]They decided just not to.
[90:10.10]It's been the same gross peanut butter flavored... No, no, no.
[90:13.74]Butter flavored, like, throw up smell induced vomit jelly beans forever.
[90:20.52]Buttered popcorn?
[90:21.18]Like, if you eat that... I'm sorry, I can't understand how.
[90:24.96]I think I just said, like, 14 words out of order.
[90:33.07]You know what I mean, though.
[90:39.78]Buttered popcorn jelly bellies are just... I feel like they're only in there for people to make jokes about.
[90:44.70]I don't like them.
[91:05.59]Don't all do the same thing at once.
[91:07.13]Alright, I'm safe.
[91:15.00]For now.
[91:21.38]It's going faster.
[91:23.92]It's the worst thing to pick.
[91:25.64]Wait.
[91:26.22]Oh boy.
[91:27.46]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[91:29.48]Oh boy.
[91:33.73]Oh, boy.
[91:40.79]Oh, boy.
[91:41.50]Did I jump on this one?
[91:45.02]Oh, no.
[91:45.54]I shouldn't have done that.
[91:46.58]Okay, I'm good.
[91:47.24]That guy really fucked up, but he's still alive.
[92:03.39]Why are we so good?
[92:04.23]We're all like the 11-year-olds that fall instantly.
[92:07.61]Come on.
[92:08.87]Are we all 30?
[92:11.73]Yeah, I think so.
[92:13.17]Probably.
[92:24.66]Fall off.
[92:26.30]Somebody fall off.
[92:29.06]Somebody fall.
[92:29.66]There's only two more people need to fall.
[92:30.74]Fall.
[92:38.19]Oh, shit.
[92:39.41]Alright, one more and we're good.
[92:41.25]Yes.
[92:44.85]It's kind of sad.
[92:47.51]What, this game is all, like, 30-year-olds?
[92:51.84]And we all think that everybody else is 10?
[92:58.74]I never thought about it like that.
[93:11.31]Why can't we just have fun?
[93:13.30]Yeah, why does it matter?
[93:14.00]That doesn't matter.
[93:18.04]Why can't we just have a good time?
[93:24.00]No.
[93:24.60]No fun.
[93:26.35]I don't like this one.
[93:45.95]Am I fucking this up?
[93:46.69]I think I'm fucking this up.
[93:47.57]I might be messing this up for us.
[93:50.47]I'm like throwing them and they're bouncing back.
[93:59.72]Get the golden egg.
[94:00.42]Alright, we got more blue over here.
[94:02.16]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[94:10.57]Don't get- No!
[94:12.45]Get it in there.
[94:13.35]Good, good.
[94:13.87]Okay, back in the game.
[94:17.86]How much is a gold egg worth?
[94:19.92]No.
[94:20.34]Are we going to be the team that everybody comes and just ruins?
[94:23.44]No.
[94:24.36]I'll be defense.
[94:25.06]Fine.
[94:25.35]Get eggs in here.
[94:34.41]I'm defending this place with my fucking life, guys.
[94:54.83]Oh my god, we're so bad.
[94:56.05]This is awful.
[94:57.73]This is so bad.
[94:58.82]What do I do?
[95:00.12]What am I supposed to do?
[95:06.16]We'd lose.
[95:06.48]It's over.
[95:06.94]We could only get one egg to stay here.
[95:14.42]I'll be the only guy that has one egg.
[95:38.94]That wasn't toxic.
[95:41.83]It was zero seconds left.
[95:43.21]Toxic.
[95:48.83]Toxic.
[95:53.46]Could have won.
[95:54.26]We had two points.
[95:57.04]The people in second place had 21.
[95:58.86]Am I going to play Minecraft today?
[96:08.47]No.
[96:10.31]Probably not going to play Minecraft for another year.
[96:12.41]That's not true.
[96:12.99]FTK is happening in like two weeks.
[96:15.11]Sorry about that.
[96:15.73]Never mind.
[96:17.67]Like three weeks or something.
[96:25.41]Oh, I want to make sure I say this.
[96:27.35]The reason why the DLC movie night was going to be the end of August is because I didn't really give anybody a cutoff date.
[96:36.73]I did that stream and then disappeared for two and a half months.
[96:40.08]So now, on the 23rd, that's the last time you can submit anything.
[96:44.94]And please go check out the rules.
[96:49.24]What, I got banned?
[96:51.64]No, I didn't.
[96:55.97]Am I in low priority queue?
[96:57.43]What happened?
[96:57.89]I didn't get actually banned, did I?
[97:12.86]No.
[97:13.04]I'm good.

[100:09.71]I'm just playing the game.
[100:43.40]You get what you fucking deserve.
[100:50.34]You shook me off a little and I was holding up on the controller thinking he would go off.
[101:01.67]Fucking smashing my hand.
[101:04.19]Okay, I have to- I need focus music.
[101:05.93]I don't even know what focus music is right now.
[101:07.55]I don't know, like a dial tone?
[101:21.69]Why can I not hear this?
[101:27.87]Why can't I hear that?
[101:28.70]I can't hear it, you can.
[101:42.74]First thing you think about when you want to focus.
[101:45.37]Um, first thing when I want to focus, focus.

[102:32.58]That's not a real song, and that's... I mean, maybe it is.
[102:44.93]Why is it Halloween?
[102:52.43]What's the difference between a Halloween fart and a Christmas fart?
[102:55.96]I think they both did the same thing.
[102:58.82]Did you put one through an echo filter with like a pitch shift on it?
[103:12.83]He needs to center his Chi.
[103:14.19]Alright.
[103:14.61]I hate this one.
[103:15.49]This one's too easy just to blow up and just lose.
[103:32.59]Where do you think you're going?
[103:39.41]Back off, scum.
[103:42.73]What happened to that?

[110:55.09]I'm trying to find out where there are farts.
[110:59.45]This is every haunted house I've ever been to.
[111:06.91]There's nothing there.
[111:13.10]Wait, what if- wait.
[111:15.58]Oh no.
[111:17.66]I've had wrong audio.
[111:18.82]I've had fucked up audio the whole stream.
[111:25.30]Yep, my audio has been completely toast the entire stream.
[111:29.04]So I have a pair of headphones that I have an extender for.
[111:32.86]And that extender, for some reason, when I plug the headphones into the extender, if it's not just right, it can really just screw up the entire audio.
[111:40.63]It's muffled and shitty sounding, and I have to wiggle it around a little.
[111:45.53]So it actually, I cannot hear what's going on there.
[111:48.71]I have to wiggle the thing around.
[112:10.56]Wait, don't fall for that?
[112:11.52]Is that not true?
[112:15.80]That really is a problem that I have and it looked like it wasn't plugged in all the way.
[112:18.52]Oh, you guys are just fucking around.
[112:21.95]Oh, okay.
[112:28.53]So one of you just made this and uploaded it.

[113:07.49]Now I'm going to watch the guy just desperately coming and I'm going to just walk over right when he gets right here.
[113:14.06]Is it toxic?
[113:16.68]Isn't that just part of the jelly bean game?
[113:19.44]I can do this.
[113:22.08]It's toxic.
[113:37.81]I saw that right side over there there was like 10 people so I'm like no I'm not alright this guy right here is doing it let's see if he gets it 37 no where is he oh

[114:11.94]I have to like turn the music off on this.
[114:21.97]What is calming Fortnite music?
[114:27.46]Fortnite has a soundtrack?
[114:35.38]It does?
[114:35.75]It has a soundtrack.
[114:43.69]Is it something that people actually listen to?
[114:59.55]Why is this left one not going down ever again?
[115:09.32]You saw that what the hell was that?
[115:22.18]Alright, that was stupid.
[115:24.12]That thing stayed up for five rotations.
[115:25.90]Alright, get out.
[115:27.12]Get out, get out, get out.
[115:31.32]I'll put on the Fortnite song.

[115:39.33]Where's the Fortnite song?
[115:47.77]No, that's... Why am I BRB'd?
[115:51.65]Preston.
[115:54.31]Fortnite music, the calm before the storm.
[115:57.42]Is this gonna work?
[116:03.34]Uh, go back.
[116:04.50]What am I doing?
[116:06.05]Okay, let's... Relaxing gaming music, Fortnite OST.
[116:20.81]This is not haunted house music.
[116:21.91]This sounds like Halloween music.
[116:30.89]I'm going to get a DMCA from Fortnite?
[116:35.94]What?
[116:36.40]Really?
[116:36.74]Okay.
[116:48.60]Okay.
[116:51.40]No music.
[116:52.50]Just only my breath.
[116:54.14]That's all you're going to get.
[117:07.06]No, people are going to hate that.
[117:08.30]That's not funny.
[117:09.04]That's just people.
[117:09.76]Like a thousand of you will leave if I do that.
[117:21.19]Viewers are flubbiting.
[117:22.19]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[117:24.15]I have to come in first.
[117:25.11]Why does this guy have the same clothes on?
[117:33.42]That's always the worst thing in the world.
[117:35.50]You go to a Halloween party, and you hope to God that nobody else has the... I'm the adult... I'm an adult doctor costume thing on the bag.
[117:45.76]And two other people at the party have the nurse bag costume.
[118:00.97]You go to a Halloween party and somebody's wearing the same costume that they got out of the bag from the party store.
[118:11.09]Like the costume is in a bag.
[118:12.43]Does nobody understand what I'm saying?
[118:23.59]When you go to a Halloween party and everyone's dressed up, and a bunch of those people there got their Halloween costume 40 minutes before the party,
[118:31.38]And they got it out of a bag.
[118:33.14]It's just a bag.
[118:34.20]It's got a hat, a little thing for a mask, a suit.
[118:39.04]It's just a bag costume.
[118:43.88]I know what he's saying.
[118:44.70]Yeah, why is this so bizarre?
[118:46.40]Have you guys ever been into a party store in your entire life?
[118:55.14]You know how they have just the wall of just pre-made, ready-to-go just costumes in the bag?
[119:04.88]I'm getting trolled here.
[119:11.36]What is a party store?
[119:21.93]This stuff still exists.
[119:22.99]This doesn't look like something from the 40s.
[119:25.49]This is the bag costume.
[119:29.48]And it's Wolverine and the legs, the pants are so short that they end up being like capris.
[119:34.63]And you get like a shitty Wolverine mask that covers half of the top part of your face.
[119:41.73]And for some reason the arms are so baggy.
[119:45.35]I've worn them before.
[119:46.13]Shit doesn't even come with claws.
[119:58.56]I was in a good position until I got hit.
[119:59.91]I'm just, what RNG is this?
[120:05.05]I'm getting hit with every single fucking one of these.
[120:07.03]It's the music, I need music.
[120:26.45]What can I put on for music?
[120:28.01]That's not going to get my channel fucking terminated.
[120:30.07]Am I going to have to make my own music to listen to on stream?
[120:43.39]Put on the Tekken 4 OST.
[120:45.23]Alright, now you're talking.
[120:47.75]I don't even know what this is.
[120:48.55]Damn it, I want to play this one.
[120:55.41]Not fair.
[120:57.30]This one looks so cool.
[120:58.38]Tekken 4 full soundtrack.
[121:09.32]This one looks fun.
[121:10.68]I've never seen that one.
[121:17.24]I had a shot at that honeycomb level and I really blew it.
[121:19.96]I'm so sad.
[121:20.56]I'm gonna get DMCA'd by Tekken.
[121:30.10]not that's not gonna happen this is pretty perfect gaming music louder it sounds like I just grab this is right in the middle of a drum solo
[122:03.19]Oh, these sounds ruin it.
[122:18.55]No, you can't even hear it.
[122:23.29]I'll fix it.
[122:31.94]Keep the momentum going.
[122:33.18]Everyone's gonna be fine.
[122:34.42]Play Gex?
[122:48.35]I don't know what that is.
[122:53.30]Shit.
[122:54.00]Shit, shit.
[122:54.96]No, no, no, no.
[122:56.56]Don't.
[122:56.94]Please.
[122:57.42]I was the last motherfucker to cross that finish line.
[123:01.76]Alright.
[123:02.20]How do I... Yikes.
[123:17.16]Please don't.
[123:18.84]Don't.
[123:19.08]That's actually going to get me in trouble.
[123:21.64]Okay?
[123:21.74]Okay.
[123:29.53]This is just what happens when the DJ is setting up his shit.
[123:40.96]He hasn't started doing anything yet.
[123:42.20]He doesn't start for another 15 minutes.
[123:50.12]Never play 100 Gex.
[123:51.23]It's awful.
[123:51.95]I don't even know what that is.
[123:53.05]I don't know.
[123:54.19]I'll listen to it off stream.
[123:55.99]What?
[124:05.12]Oh, shit!
[124:10.60]I'm just barely getting these.
[124:11.84]Oh, dear!
[124:27.08]Oh, why?
[124:29.54]No, dude.
[124:30.99]It hit me with everything.
[124:32.77]It hit me every single time.
[125:01.17]You hope I get banned.
[125:02.47]I lost!
[125:36.14]That sounds kind of scary.
[125:37.38]Get off me!
[126:06.60]I feel like I have to be on drugs staring up at the ceiling for this song to make sense.

[132:09.03]I feel like I would have the same amount of fun.
[132:34.38]Do it on stream.
[132:35.14]Do it.
[132:36.97]And that's not to say that that's not fun, right?
[132:48.36]Yeah, you just need to get like 10 people in the same room to do that.
[133:05.08]Too afraid.
[133:06.80]It would have stayed up, wouldn't it?

[135:23.96]And just whoever didn't get grabbed the last like five like burnt kernels that didn't get picked up, they win the game?
[135:48.53]Don't give it to them.
[135:49.41]Don't give it to them.
[135:50.13]They want that.
[135:56.40]That's what they want.
[135:57.74]They're all just sitting there waiting for it.
[136:00.34]I'm not going to give it to you.
[136:01.14]I'm going to be very... I'm mad.
[136:02.89]No, I'm not.

[137:46.87]You don't have to come in first, you don't have to qualify, it doesn't matter.
[137:49.73]Just make it to the top, it doesn't matter.
[137:52.67]I'm trying to get ahead of people and it's just get to the top.
[138:05.19]What's the point of even trying to do the super secret jump bounce thing when it's just gonna kill you?
[138:17.59]These people can all fight each other.
[138:18.87]I don't even care.
[138:19.55]I'm just going to try to finish.
[138:20.73]I'm not doing anything sneaky, anything weird.
[138:24.45]I just want to win.
[138:26.57]They all should have waited.
[138:31.56]I've hit somebody's fucking crotch.
[138:44.32]You can't have this many people in the ball pit at the same time.
[138:57.21]Somebody said this level is the scrub killer.
[138:59.05]Alright, this is the furthest I've ever been.
[139:10.70]I'm sorry, dude.
[139:16.76]Alright, easy, easy.
[139:22.79]There's nobody around me.
[139:25.25]Get away from me.

[140:06.58]Seven people, that's it?
[140:08.74]There is a... 18% chance that I win this game, just because I exist.
[140:20.01]Alright, I'm gonna win this one.
[140:21.74]I'm gonna turn this fucking music off.
[140:23.10]I don't know, what is this music?
[140:26.28]Turn it off, turn it off.
[140:29.52]Quiet, I want complete silence.
[140:39.44]Thank you.
[141:14.60]The fucking button didn't work.

[143:46.48]Why are you not giving me a playlist?
[143:52.14]Oh, it's Yakuza.
[143:52.96]Alright, whatever.
[143:59.83]I really thought I was going to win that one.
[144:04.24]When I saw that there was four people eliminated and there was only two people left.
[144:09.00]Oh.
[144:10.94]I really thought I was going to be the one.
[144:12.46]Thought I had more space.
[144:14.63]Oh.
[144:28.83]There were actually three left.
[144:30.05]Yeah.
[144:32.90]Shit, I don't think you can win.
[144:35.24]It's like winning the lottery.
[144:40.93]You always know somebody does, but you don't.
[144:58.27]Put on the cheers to you.
[145:01.33]No, no, no, no.
[145:02.49]We are not at that drastic of a time period for that.
[145:05.24]See, this level, the whole thing doesn't matter until right here.
[145:28.75]8302, that's me.
[145:29.33]42.

[147:44.98]What chain was the Noid?
[147:50.68]Pizza Hut?
[147:51.20]What did they get rid of him for?
[147:52.04]He used to bounce around on a pogo stick, right?
[147:57.56]Why'd I get rid of them?
[147:58.82]Those dominoes.
[147:59.48]Why'd they get rid of the Noid?
[148:00.34]What was wrong with them?
[148:08.49]Gotta get in the middle.
[148:10.53]Okay.

[148:43.41]Why is Seinfeld the same thing?
[148:45.03]Wait, wait!
[148:45.51]I wasn't paying attention!
[148:47.43]Where have we been?
[148:48.27]I don't know.
[148:48.89]I have no idea.
[148:49.59]I wasn't paying any attention at all.
[148:50.66]I'm just gonna stand over here with all these people.
[149:09.13]Okay.

[149:13.95]I don't know what the watermelon is.
[149:15.03]Just ask the audience.
[149:24.32]Wait, why did the music just become... Okay, come on.
[149:30.42]I'm never gonna win.
[149:52.39]No soccer.
[149:53.93]Jump over the spinning beam and avoid falling into the slime.
[149:57.09]Oh, I haven't done this one yet.
[149:58.11]This is a new one.
[150:14.92]Wait, wait, wait, there's two of them.
[150:16.08]There's two, there's two, there's two, but there's two, but there's two, there's two, there's two, there's two.
[150:19.42]Oh.
[150:21.95]Does it go faster?
[150:22.62]I just don't want to be in the same space as everybody else.
[150:37.73]Oh my god!
[150:59.94]Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit!
[151:00.74]No! Ugh.
[151:32.86]Just win already?
[151:33.61]Hold on, let me just- let me just go get a deck of cards and just fucking fan it into the air and then just go find the ace.
[151:41.37]Am I- am I doing enough, like, metaphors for this game?
[151:44.94]How many am I- that's like four.
[152:08.23]I'm gonna get the Fast Pass.
[152:38.91]This is a game made for babysitting.
[152:41.21]Maybe if you had 60 babies.
[152:42.97]They were all playing in the same lobby.
[153:04.89]A baby LAN party?
[153:14.81]Quite a few people, actually.
[153:19.61]So what are we doing tomorrow?

[154:36.57]It'll be here soon.
[154:37.25]God damn it.

[155:06.32]I'm not gonna qualify.
[155:07.88]It's over.
[155:09.34]I don't think I'm gonna qualify.
[155:18.24]I gotta overtake a bunch of people right now or it's not happening.

[162:16.03]I don't feel fulfilled at all.
[162:18.53]I just feel horrible actually.
[162:20.17]I feel like I don't feel fulfilled.
[162:22.46]I need ten more.
[162:25.46]And maybe it'll be close.
[162:41.08]That one doesn't, that one, I don't feel fulfilled on that one.
[162:43.34]That one was like the servers died and like 30 people got booted.
[162:59.74]But I got fiber internet.
[163:01.18]That means my internet outlasted them, right?
[163:03.04]That somebody said that.
[163:05.03]That counts as a mini game.
[163:09.17]I didn't get any rewards either.
[163:15.60]Oh, I didn't win.
[163:22.35]That was a pretend win.
[163:23.39]Oh, alright.
[163:29.77]Well, I'm probably going to play Riddick tomorrow.
[163:33.96]That game looks insane.
[163:42.16]I feel like I'm going to have a ton of fun in Riddick.
[163:45.24]It's a stealth game.
[163:45.98]You gotta like break people's necks behind them and there's like a shooter and stuff.
[163:52.52]It's like a shooting game, right?
[163:53.88]Like third person, first person.
[164:04.25]Perfect game, yeah.
[164:08.07]You should play Fall, guys.
[164:10.73]It really sucks that the one that I'm potentially going out on is the fake one that I didn't even really win.
[164:15.53]That makes it even worse.
[164:22.34]I feel horrible.
[164:23.14]Like, I wanted to win so bad, and I didn't.
[164:25.10]I pretend won.
[164:27.70]I don't feel good.
[164:29.18]I hate this.
[164:37.57]The servers are dead.
[164:38.35]Okay.
[164:38.45]Alright.
[164:39.77]Alright.
[164:46.78]Tomorrow, that's it.
[164:48.30]I'm going to call it here.
[164:52.55]I'll probably do a longer one tomorrow.
[164:55.03]I'm feeling probably like a more than five or six hour stream probably tomorrow.
[165:00.35]I really want to play Riddick.
[165:08.96]If you log in again, you'll have a crown.
[165:10.72]Is that true?
[165:11.22]Let me see.
[165:22.54]The Chronicles of Riddick?
[165:23.40]Yeah.
[165:24.92]They made a couple of games.
[165:26.46]Actually, they made one game, then they remade it and added a DLC campaign and just made it another game.
[165:31.57]Kind of a weird development story, actually.
[165:35.26]Let me actually just see this.
[165:36.24]Do I get a crown?
[165:48.29]Can you start streaming five hours later tomorrow?
[165:51.75]I will probably start tomorrow around 11 to 12 Pacific.
[165:59.13]Probably like 11.
[166:04.03]My servers are still dead.
[166:04.91]Damn.
[166:05.13]Okay.
[166:06.27]Alright.
[166:06.93]Well, at least I got to play it.
[166:09.39]I didn't know if I was going to get to play this or not.
[166:13.85]And I did technically win.
[166:16.82]So you can take that away from me if you want.
[166:18.26]You can remove that from my gamer license.
[166:20.20]That's fine.
[166:21.10]But I did technically win a game.
[166:25.40]Alright, yeah.
[166:25.82]I'll see you guys later.
[166:27.00]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[166:31.14]I actually kind of like it.
[166:32.50]I think it's fun.
[166:41.71]I'll see you tomorrow.
[166:42.19]Somewhere around probably 11 o'clock Pacific.
[166:45.61]There's a shitload of people here.
[166:46.73]And, you know, I'll be honest with you.
[166:47.89]There's been a shitload of people here since I came back.
[166:52.91]Like, 7,000 to 10,000 viewers every stream now.
[166:56.19]I can't even... It's ridiculous.
[167:02.41]These are numbers that I didn't think were fucking possible.
[167:05.75]So, I am shocked that this many people are still sticking around.
[167:09.45]So, happy you're here.
[167:11.73]I hope that you continue to enjoy it.
[167:13.13]I hope we have fun.
[167:15.27]Because I'm shocked that there's this many people here.
[167:19.09]And I'll see you tomorrow.
[167:22.91]Let's run the credits.
[167:24.65]I think I got this finally fixed.
[167:26.62]If I didn't, then you're going to hear me yell.
[167:29.74]There was a whole... I forgot about that.
[167:31.10]There was an entire AI dungeon segment of this stream.
[167:33.68]I forgot.
[167:34.10]It was like an hour.
[167:45.12]Alright, here comes the credits.
[167:46.24]Hopefully.
[167:49.07]Yeah, alright.
[167:50.45]But they're in the wrong spot.
[167:52.15]It's okay.
[167:52.69]They're spaced weirdly.
[167:54.75]And they have an even stranger font.
[168:00.71]What is this font?
[168:09.82]What is going on with your credits, dude?
[168:12.02]I don't know.
[168:19.93]I'm trying to make it work.
[168:25.41]They're fucked up.
[168:27.29]Star Wars crawl.
[168:28.29]No, no, there we go.
[168:28.93]Alright.
[168:29.61]Just pretend that they're back there.
[168:31.27]Wait.
[168:31.43]Oh, then they're too small.
[168:38.68]Whatever.
[168:43.00]Yeah, I moved it down all the way.
[168:44.64]I think my layers are just screwed up.
[168:51.48]Oh, I replaced... Oh, I see.
[168:56.80]Okay, I replaced the layer that this is supposed to be behind with, like, just images.
[169:02.41]I don't know what the... I don't know.
[169:13.91]Oh, that was the last thing.
[169:19.11]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[169:22.78]We'll play Riddick.
[169:23.54]You know what?
[169:24.24]I could just wake up tomorrow and be like, nah, fuck that.
[169:25.90]We're going to do something else.
[169:27.50]That was Fall Guys AI Dungeon in about 35 minutes of me being irritated that my Ethernet port didn't work.
[169:33.92]Hope to see you tomorrow!
[169:47.56]It was a fun stream.
[169:49.26]I had fun.
[169:58.57]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[170:04.22]Raid of... Dude, you know?
[170:12.04]You know who's streaming right now that, you know, I hang out with him a lot?
[170:17.06]Like, in real life?
[170:22.48]It's Orb.
[170:23.89]He's an IncredibleOrb.
[170:26.05]He's a wicked good streamer.
[170:31.89]He hangs out where I see him a lot.
[170:33.51]Like at least once or twice a year.
[170:37.49]Let's go.
[170:37.85]I'm streaming early enough.
[170:42.74]What's he doing?
[170:45.08]Among us?
[170:47.34]What is among us?
[170:56.03]I'll go say hello.
[170:56.75]Is it a game?
[170:59.69]Is it a good game?
[171:03.13]Alright, you guys are all getting dump trucked on his stream.
[171:05.93]So, like, be nice.
[171:07.26]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[171:15.78]Have a good night.
[171:34.49]Oh, mute.
[171:35.27]Sorry.
[172:13.50]Oh my God.
