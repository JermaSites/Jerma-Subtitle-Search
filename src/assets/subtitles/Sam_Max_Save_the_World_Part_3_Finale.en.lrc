[00:02.22]Hello, everybody.
[00:06.34]Hello?
[00:08.74]Where is he?
[00:11.08]It's only been like one minute.
[00:12.20]Come on, I'm a little slow today.
[00:17.48]The gas is empty.
[00:19.98]My car needs to be filled up.
[00:26.07]Ugh!
[00:29.63]He's a little short today.
[00:30.67]A little, yeah.
[00:31.53]Just a little bit.
[00:34.37]So, uh, last night I did mention that, you know, depending on how I woke up, I had some things to do tomorrow.
[00:46.24]But if I got up and I was alright, then we were gonna go, and so we're gonna go.
[00:49.20]We're good.
[00:51.84]Sunday stream, hope you're having a good afternoon.
[00:53.45]Hope you got some sleep after last night.
[00:55.85]I did.
[00:56.11]A little bit of a hangover, but it's okay.
[01:00.21]We're gonna play Sam & Max.
[01:03.01]We're gonna relax.
[01:03.75]We're gonna finish up Season 1.
[01:10.18]Only one episode remains.
[01:14.82]We'll see how long this takes.
[01:23.74]You said it, little buddy.
[01:26.59]And then, depending... Maybe season two?
[01:29.43]Maybe start episode one?
[01:31.75]Or maybe wait?
[01:33.01]Maybe play some more?
[01:34.45]This is going to be one of those streams where we just chill.
[01:36.93]And do whatever.
[01:40.07]After last night, I need a... I need a relaxing stream.
[01:51.43]Alright.
[01:53.15]So, I got everything ready to go.
[01:56.56]Oh shit, it is Cinco.
[01:57.48]Yeah, Cinco de Mayo.
[02:00.30]I drank on the wrong day.
[02:06.70]Oops.
[02:11.41]Well, anyways.
[02:13.19]That's alright.
[02:14.99]No, I am not drinking again today.
[02:16.97]No.
[02:19.25]I need a two to three week cool down period in between every time I drink.
[02:28.29]Hey, you've seen that before.
[02:29.23]I have to get in and just do some audio stuff.
[02:35.50]May the fifth of vodka be with you.
[02:39.92]No, don't give me this hair of the dog bullshit.
[02:43.99]No way.
[02:45.17]That's a crock of shit, I'll tell you that much.
[02:47.43]Ready?
[02:49.05]Why on Earth?
[02:51.43]What in any scenario?
[02:54.22]would you drinking booze make you feel better after drinking booze all day or all night no it just like it just your brain up more and it just locks you down it just puts you back into being drunk again no it's water potassium you know coconut water pedia light just hydrate
[03:22.01]Don't, like, take a shot of whiskey when you get up in the morning.
[03:24.41]Don't do that.
[03:24.95]Alright, so let's go.
[03:31.55]How loud is it?
[03:32.11]Not bad.
[03:32.45]Uh, I had to do some video.
[03:36.01]GameTap.
[03:36.49]I remember that company.
[03:37.69]Which is why every citizen will find a complimentary government-issued aerosol in the mailbox.
[03:43.65]Get to spraying, America!
[03:45.39]Let's eat this mother up!
[03:52.52]That building was really close.
[03:53.62]This has been an announcement from the president of the United States.
[03:58.75]I forgot he's president, right?
[04:01.19]What?
[04:01.79]Oh, sorry, little buddy in chief.
[04:03.57]I'm still thinking about our last case.
[04:05.53]Little buddy in chief.
[04:06.23]The internet said it was working for somebody named Roy G. Biv.
[04:09.17]That's what you guys called me.
[04:11.05]But for who?
[04:12.39]For whom?
[04:13.15]We're detectives, Sam, not mind readers.
[04:15.23]Hey, maybe we should ask Q Bliss.
[04:17.15]Mind readers, that's it.
[04:19.28]No, that's not it.
[04:20.18]By the way, have you seen my copy of Emetics?
[04:22.85]The Handbook for Multicolored Happiness by Hugh Bliss?
[04:25.57]Colors?
[04:26.65]no think max think well I know I had it this morning that's it morning in the ancient tongue of the mud worshiping kapala hutek tribe of the serengeti our word mourning means he who destroys the hypnotic rainbow man that's the word he fears the most so this Roy g bibb is the one person we've met who's never said the word morning and that means it's it's the committee he never said the word commissioner I never did trust him no chowder head it's hugh bliss never
[04:55.96]Oh, no, Commissioner.
[04:56.76]I didn't mean... Look, I need you to put out an APB on Hugh Bliss.
[05:00.08]Yeah, Max is still president, as of now.
[05:02.56]By the Greek goddess Selene in a chariot with dual overhead cams and silver fox mud flaps.
[05:07.14]We're on our way.
[05:08.64]Let's go, Max.
[05:09.78]The Commissioner said that Hugh Bliss is currently staying at his exclusive prismatology retreat, the Blister of Tranquility.
[05:16.19]Oh, boy!
[05:16.91]I bet it's somewhere really cool and exotic, like a remote island in the South Pacific or Des Moines.
[05:21.71]Even farther, pal.
[05:23.48]The game is quiet?
[05:24.86]It shouldn't be.
[05:26.30]I'll turn it up.
[05:29.02]It's jermaMoon!
[05:31.70]jermaMoon!
[05:40.32]Why is his face on the moon?
[05:47.18]How's the hangover?
[05:47.76]It's alright.
[05:49.10]It's not terrible.
[05:52.65]I woke up, it was like 4 to 5 on the 10 point hangover skill.
[05:59.38]We've diminished down to about 3.
[06:01.80]I'm good.
[06:03.80]Just a little slow.
[06:09.65]Bright side of the moon.
[06:13.95]You woke up covered in cardboard and wine.
[06:23.23]You always did know how not to infringe on a registered trademark, little buddy.
[06:27.09]What are we doing first, Sam?
[06:28.71]Let's locate the Blister of Tranquility, find out what you Bliss is up to, and arrest his unprincipled magical butt.
[06:35.19]Is that a visitor's center?
[06:37.55]Visitor's centers are on the moon.
[06:40.81]They...
[06:42.98]Don't scoff at that.
[06:43.86]Eventually, you're gonna be able to go to the moon for free.
[06:49.71]That's right.
[06:50.15]There's gonna be just a train you can take from here to the moon.
[06:54.51]Not gonna cost any money.
[06:55.33]It's gonna be old news in like a hundred years.
[06:57.57]Alright, Harry.
[07:04.58]Wait, what's the...?
[07:05.06]Well, well.
[07:05.90]Aren't you Teddy Bear?
[07:07.64]Once upon a time, but no longer.
[07:12.81]Wasn't this person way bigger?
[07:15.45]This dude was like 10 feet tall.
[07:20.25]How would a train work?
[07:21.85]Just lay train tracks down to the moon.
[07:24.34]It's gonna be like an Elon Musk bullet train.
[07:28.96]There'll be floating moon beams or something.
[07:31.62]Doesn't matter.
[07:33.60]reusing assets who are you now I've gone back to being Harry mole man or should I say I've gone forward prismatology has helped me find a new me where the old one used to be prismatology so this that's the whole mind control thing it's been huge the whole time
[07:56.11]Uh, you seem shorter than you used to.
[07:58.67]Tiny.
[07:59.01]I used to use that exoskeleton, but prismatology has taught me that size doesn't matter.
[08:04.99]Color does!
[08:06.35]Hairy Mole Man will never be sensitive about being diminutive again.
[08:11.35]Or about referring to himself in the third person, apparently.
[08:13.91]Uh, Elsa, you exploded.
[08:15.95]Didn't you explode?
[08:17.29]Only in the spiritual sense.
[08:18.89]Prismatology helped me put Hairy Mole Man back together again.
[08:23.12]Looks like it may have left out a few pieces by mistake.
[08:27.09]Hold on.
[08:27.69]Let's stream labs and windows.
[08:29.59]In the wrong spot!
[08:33.26]Are you still a criminal?
[08:33.96]Are you still a notorious criminal?
[08:35.60]Or an obscure one, like Kevin Mitnick.
[08:37.90]No.
[08:37.96]I don't know who that is.
[08:39.50]I've repostulated my lemma since Prismatology found me.
[08:43.08]It's the straight and narrow for Harry Moleman from here on out.
[08:48.93]Whatever you say.
[08:50.17]So is prismatology like a take on Scientology?
[08:52.68]Is that kind of what the deal is here?
[09:11.49]Alright, where's Mr. Hugh Bliss?
[09:14.54]Seen Hugh Bliss around here lately?
[09:16.20]To see the master, I need only search my heart.
[09:19.56]I meant see him in the traditional fashion.
[09:22.06]No, he's usually in the blister these days.
[09:26.56]Okay, so where's the blister?
[09:28.07]Which way to the blister of tranquility?
[09:30.41]Enlightenment is the only way to reach the blister of tranquility.
[09:34.57]How about we enlighten your skull a little?
[09:36.85]Would that work?
[09:37.99]The blister is through that little box right over there.
[09:41.34]Little box.
[09:42.10]Alright.
[09:43.04]What else we got?
[09:44.50]Oh, wait, wait.
[09:50.79]Before we... Wait, wait.
[09:51.59]Okay, so this is the Blister of Tranquility.
[09:53.93]Oh, it's this guy back again.
[09:56.03]Wait, didn't we fire this guy?
[09:57.35]No, he went on vacation.
[10:00.55]Hold on.
[10:00.93]Let's, uh... Hypno Beam display.
[10:04.36]Let's just look.
[10:05.70]What's supposed to go here?
[10:07.14]These hypnotic goggles were an early prototype of the hypno-beam technology currently being used to further the worldwide goals of prismatology.
[10:15.55]Wow!
[10:16.15]Invisible goggles!
[10:17.66]The goggles were stolen a few months ago.
[10:19.90]Honestly, some people will take anything that's not bolted to the floor.
[10:26.15]So, alright.
[10:27.67]What is this thing?
[10:29.25]Can I pick up the spoon?
[10:30.05]What's this?
[10:30.89]Looks like a bent spoon with some peanut butter on it.
[10:33.97]The power to bend and re-bend spoons stored within this completely indestructible magical talisman was among the first mental abilities to be developed and popularized by Hugh Bliss.
[10:45.16]Big deal.
[10:45.96]I can bend spoons with my bare hands.
[10:48.24]One question.
[10:49.56]Would it work on wrenches?
[10:51.89]Hmm, yeah.
[10:53.42]The ranch is close enough.
[10:55.04]Interesting, interesting.
[10:56.68]Ah, you made me forget where I was.
[10:58.82]Let's see.
[10:59.76]Indestructible magical intelligence.
[11:01.60]Oh, yeah.
[11:02.50]The virtually indestructible display case is a triumph of modern prismatological science.
[11:08.61]No, let it break!
[11:09.11]Okay, so... Yeah, how are they breathing?
[11:38.54]There's no oxygen on the moon.
[11:40.06]What's with the chart?
[11:41.35]I bet it shows how Justin Timberlake is descended from the moon people.
[11:45.49]This chart outlines Hugh Bliss' ingenious master plan to hypnotize everyone on Earth through connections with the U.S.
[11:51.37]government, the internet, and the toy mafia.
[11:53.89]Well, that was close.
[11:55.09]That was a boomer joke.
[11:57.63]You're right.
[11:58.45]I was.
[11:59.37]I wonder why I didn't know anything about this at the time.
[12:01.75]Have you ever been to the moon?
[12:05.19]Have you ever been to the moon?
[12:07.23]So you can't tell me what's there.
[12:09.56]You don't know what's there.
[12:10.70]You've just been shown things on TV.
[12:12.26]You know what else is shown on TV?
[12:16.55]Dragons.
[12:17.75]And fire.
[12:21.40]Like, dragon's real?
[12:22.84]Alright, I'm doing like a moon isn't real thing, and I don't really want to be the guy that says that.
[12:28.00]Moonbanger?
[12:28.24]What does this thing say?
[12:47.03]Alright, so we gotta find a way to get by this.
[12:49.65]So he's gonna... frisk.
[12:50.43]We have to somehow get that out of here without him frisking us, or without him finding it somehow.
[13:16.54]Let me look around.
[13:17.10]This is a Lunar Lander.
[13:19.99]This is ours.
[13:20.65]No, wait, what?
[13:25.39]It's a Lunar Lander.
[13:29.37]It's a Lunar Lander.
[13:33.01]No, that wasn't an Undertale reference, guys.
[13:37.31]Not everything is an Undertale reference.
[13:40.26]Lovely shirt.
[13:41.35]Can I get one, Sam?
[13:42.41]Can I, can I, can I, can I?
[13:44.05]You don't wear shirts, Max.
[13:45.71]I can still accumulate them, can't I?
[13:49.31]One moment, please.
[13:50.53]What the hell?
[13:50.95]I didn't do anything.
[13:52.93]Okay.
[13:53.75]Go ahead.
[13:55.45]So we have to get him to run away somehow.
[14:01.54]He's gonna be like, there's a slightly beat up robotic exoskeleton in the trash.
[14:04.88]I have to go to the bathroom!
[14:05.94]The past is only useful as fertilizer for the future.
[14:09.46]Hugh Bliss said that.
[14:12.46]We'll just give him a soda.
[14:14.22]He'll just pee.
[14:17.32]Alright.
[14:17.58]What's going on with you?
[14:18.22]What's Superball?
[14:18.92]What are you doing here?
[14:20.54]It's Tuesday already?
[14:21.24]Greetings, newcomers.
[14:22.22]Blessed be.
[14:22.62]I do like the tie.
[14:40.56]But what are you doing here?
[14:41.54]So let me guess.
[14:42.99]You're guarding the door to this retreat.
[14:45.25]Affirmative.
[14:45.89]I have a passion for it, sir.
[14:47.27]And Hugh Bliss believed in my door-guarding abilities when no one else would.
[14:50.52]Great story.
[14:51.12]Great story.
[14:51.96]Okay, let us in.
[14:53.19]Negative.
[14:53.87]Only level red prismatologists may enter Hublis's magical Paradise.
[14:58.33]What's a level red prismatologist?
[15:00.51]Because I'm pretty sure I am one.
[15:02.63]Level red is apex of prismatology, sir.
[15:04.95]You'd have to undergo spectrum analysis to determine your current level.
[15:08.36]Spectrum analysis?
[15:10.16]Is that where you lie perfectly still in a lead coffin while brightly colored cotton swabs are inserted into various orifices?
[15:16.36]No, sir.
[15:16.86]We gave that up in 87.
[15:18.32]It's much simpler now.
[15:21.39]Uh, so let's try it.
[15:22.27]What is it?
[15:22.69]Yep, we're level red.
[15:23.93]Let us in.
[15:24.73]I'm sure you're mistaken, but we'll run the spectrum analysis anyway.
[15:27.79]Take this.
[15:28.77]A unicorn?
[15:29.65]What am I supposed to do with this?
[15:31.71]Rub it, sir.
[15:32.72]Rub it, Sam.
[15:34.82]Harder.
[15:36.86]Harder.
[15:39.16]I'm sorry, sir.
[15:40.00]The unicorn says you're yellow.
[15:41.80]No one calls us yeller.
[15:43.46]Draw, partner.
[15:44.68]Level yellow is frankly rather pathetic, sir.
[15:46.88]Only level reds may enter the retreat.
[15:48.92]Regulations?
[15:50.06]Hmm.
[15:51.05]I'm gonna paint it.
[15:51.95]I got paint.
[15:52.33]Do I still have to paint?
[15:53.11]You do that.
[15:53.69]Okay.
[16:08.28]Uh, how does the unicorn work?
[16:09.03]A moood ring!
[16:09.37]That works too.
[16:26.33]Why are you studying prismatology too?
[16:29.17]Not studying.
[16:30.09]I've mastered it.
[16:31.19]You mastered prismatology by standing in front of a door?
[16:33.99]I am one with the door.
[16:35.58]We exist in the indigo wavelength of reality.
[16:37.42]I thought this was a kid's game.
[16:38.38]The door is an illusion.
[16:39.08]Alright.
[16:41.74]So long, Superball.
[16:43.00]Get out of here.
[16:44.44]Do I still paint?
[16:46.61]So heat.
[16:47.11]I need to heat this up so it gets red.
[16:54.31]Yeah, so let's see if I can heat this up.
[16:56.13]What, put it on a grill or something?
[16:57.15]Go to Bosco's?
[16:57.73]Earth.
[16:57.97]That it does.
[16:58.53]That it does.
[17:23.82]How does it do that when there's no wind on the moon?
[17:28.15]Alright, let's head back.
[17:31.95]I got my item that I need.
[17:36.21]Come on, go, go, go!
[17:38.61]Where are we headed now, Sam?
[17:40.73]We are going to the Earth.
[17:41.63]Terra firma.
[17:43.45]Does it actually show you go there?
[17:44.39]Do I have to drive the car in space?
[17:51.87]No, I was gonna say, that'd be really funny.
[17:57.27]Alright, well... What is the final thing that they're doing?
[18:01.19]Let's check on Sybil.
[18:01.93]Let's see, the new... This is just called Queen.
[18:10.12]The... Canada Leaf?
[18:13.58]What's with the Canada Leaf?
[18:18.50]Relax, eh?
[18:22.12]Okay.
[18:23.30]Hiya, Sybil.
[18:24.30]Hello, Sam.
[18:25.02]Hello, Max.
[18:26.91]Queen of Canada, uh-huh.
[18:47.39]How does that work?
[18:48.11]Can L U L?
[18:48.99]That doesn't even work.
[19:18.41]There's no, like, L or O or... That's not... That doesn't even connect at all well, even remotely.
[19:37.36]But you're not Canadian, how does this work?
[19:39.60]Heck no!
[19:40.72]But we took two quarters of French in college, and we spelt... If not knowing how to spell is enough to become royalty, I could become president of the United States!
[19:52.61]You are president of the United States, Max.
[19:55.30]By God, you're right, Sam!
[19:56.98]How come I'm not bombing anything right now?
[19:59.34]Plus, we were the only candidate.
[20:05.14]What are your duties here?
[20:06.32]Throw out the first puck.
[20:06.90]Well...
[20:32.55]Um, um, um, I got one.
[20:33.19]I got one.
[20:33.51]Maple syrup.
[20:34.51]Am I right?
[20:34.77]That's pretty, that was good.
[20:57.17]How can you possibly spruce up Canada?
[20:59.23]It's a Paradise year-round, from the fresh air and great seafood of British Columbia to the bustling metropolises in Ontario and Quebec.
[21:07.07]You still have that endorsement with the tourism board?
[21:09.61]Every little bit helps make ends meet, Max, with the rate you go through new shoes.
[21:12.95]How does he do it?
[21:13.43]How does he do it?
[21:14.03]I didn't mean to blame when you were teething, Sam.
[21:20.49]Alright, so... See you later, Your Majesty.
[21:22.37]Queen of Canada.
[21:22.97]You may go.
[21:25.12]Maple, L-U-L.
[21:27.91]Maple.
[21:29.49]Maple.
[21:32.85]Now that one makes sense.
[21:38.79]Nothing special.
[21:42.07]Nothing special.
[21:44.87]Nothing special.
[21:47.29]These must be Canadian newspapers.
[21:49.55]I never realized how boring newspapers would be without guns.
[21:55.19]I know this is not the exit.
[21:56.51]I'm not gonna make that mistake.
[21:58.68]Can I ever open that?
[21:59.92]Is it ever not locked?
[22:03.02]Mape lul.
[22:07.02]That's fantastic.
[22:08.42]Alright, let's go see Bosco.
[22:21.08]Mape lul story.
[22:24.94]Alright, Bosco.
[22:25.60]What do you got?
[22:28.02]What hundred billion dollar item are you gonna... Oop.
[22:31.78]Check the tabloids.
[22:32.84]Whoa!
[22:32.96]Assistant?
[22:54.78]Needs Vaseline.
[22:55.76]Gave 10 community subs.
[22:58.92]Thank you for the 10 subs.
[23:00.60]Needs Vaseline.
[23:01.52]A lot of subs.
[23:04.66]Big sub drop.
[23:05.46]Thank you.
[23:07.76]Congratulations to those that got the subs.
[23:13.15]Okay, do you think I can do 10 claps without counting them?
[23:17.83]That was 10, right?
[23:20.12]Didn't I tell you boys not to track mud in the store?
[23:22.96]I just vacuumed.
[23:24.58]Hey, lady, we're looking for Bosco.
[23:26.08]You know him?
[23:26.94]Of course.
[23:27.99]He's my son.
[23:29.51]You're your own mother?
[23:31.43]Is there no escaping these infernal time travel paradoxes?
[23:35.29]Hey, guys, it's me, Bosco.
[23:37.29]Alright, we want to buy something.
[23:41.57]We want to buy something.
[23:42.99]Did you finish all your chores?
[23:46.00]Yes.
[23:47.12]Why is he pretending to be your mother?
[23:49.26]This is not a Russian or a French guy.
[23:57.15]Why is it his mother?
[23:59.57]Do you have any completed artificial personality disorder symptoms forms?
[24:03.83]Mm-hmm.
[24:05.28]You do?
[24:05.92]Mm-hmm.
[24:07.52]Wow, that really would have come in handy earlier.
[24:11.28]Do you have any video of a chicken eating cow manure for laughs?
[24:15.56]These are all things that we have.
[24:16.82]What?
[24:17.04]No way.
[24:19.44]Do you have any global meatball sandwich positioning systems?
[24:23.34]These are all things that exist.
[24:24.74]You gotta be kidding me.
[24:27.92]Do you have any three foot by two foot cue cards that say don't vote for me?
[24:33.52]What?
[24:34.35]I can't believe this.
[24:37.13]Aw, too bad.
[24:37.67]Too bad.
[24:55.51]Well, what do you have?
[24:56.31]What do you got?
[24:57.33]Oh, my little angel made the most precious device.
[25:01.35]It's called an earthquake maker, and it's just what you think.
[25:05.19]A diarrhea-inducing cocktail?
[25:07.40]Max, why can't you be more like your brother?
[25:10.32]He's not my brother.
[25:12.14]Sam, I don't want you hanging around with him.
[25:14.56]He's a bad influence.
[25:16.64]That he is, Mama Bosco.
[25:18.22]That he is.
[25:20.85]Alright, how much is it?
[25:21.73]A hundred trillion.
[25:22.39]He's not wrong.
[25:22.73]He's not wrong.
[25:51.13]A hundred trillion dollars.
[25:54.07]Wait, what, we can sell things, too?
[25:55.35]You know, Bosco, we've collected some pretty valuable merchandise on our travels.
[25:59.68]And we have the sneaking suspicion you've got a little extra spending money.
[26:03.68]So how'd you like to buy something from us for a change?
[26:06.56]Okay.
[26:07.48]Do you have any copies of the uncensored 1982 Armada-Santi lookalike contest on Betamax?
[26:14.03]Nope.
[26:14.85]Oh, well, that's the only thing I really need, honey.
[26:20.40]uh okay well what else mind telling us how you came to be a woman did you use lasers or just do it the old-fashioned way are you sassing me boy I will whoop your behind so hard you won't be able to see straight but I don't see out of my behind you will after I get through with you but why mom but who in their right mind would dress up as their own mother no one good point look at me when I'm talking to you
[26:48.13]Just for that, I'm not going to tell you why I dressed up as her.
[26:51.41]Oh, come on, Bosco.
[26:52.79]We were only... You just cost yourself dessert, mister.
[26:58.44]Alright.
[26:58.66]Well, see you later, Bosco.
[27:01.22]See you later, Bosco's mom.
[27:02.74]Go clean your office.
[27:03.94]It's a pigsty.
[27:07.42]Mama Bosco.
[27:10.54]By the earthquake, man.
[27:11.64]Hey, I'm gonna.
[27:12.54]And I need to make a hundred trillion dollars.
[27:18.82]Let me see here.
[27:20.32]Nacho machine.
[27:21.10]What can heat this up?
[27:21.92]Nope.
[27:23.74]Cover it in ketchup?
[27:24.48]That seemed to work before.
[27:25.34]That's already packed with flavor.
[27:28.18]Jeremiah, clean your office.
[27:29.40]Actually, it's real bad.
[27:31.89]Since last night, it's a fucking disaster in here.
[27:35.49]It's... I mean, there's just cardboard everywhere.
[27:39.81]Remember I told you I was gonna vacuum?
[27:43.49]No, I didn't do it.
[27:46.01]Do a cleaning stream.
[27:50.56]Ooh, here we go.
[27:51.28]Zap it.
[27:51.62]Red.
[27:51.76]Cleaning stream.
[27:53.39]Just vacuum the ground.
[27:54.47]Alright, so we need 100 trillion dollars for Mama Bosco.
[28:03.05]Anything else in here we can do?
[28:20.48]Give us... 100 trillion.
[28:23.06]Alright, so we can go in... We're not gonna do that yet.
[28:26.44]I'm gonna check a couple places.
[28:28.58]The chat is overloading with meme power.
[28:51.38]Overloading.
[28:52.98]Wait, what's in the gumballs?
[28:54.06]There's actual gumballs in there!
[28:56.26]Well, let me chew one!
[28:57.40]Let's go in the office.
[29:18.17]Okay, so we have dartboard.
[29:20.88]Let's check the closet.
[29:25.32]Hey guys, I'm a memer.
[29:28.60]Hey guys, I'm a memer.
[29:30.56]Did you remember to feed Leonard today, Max?
[29:35.65]Sure!
[29:36.79]Let me rephrase that.
[29:38.35]What have you been feeding him?
[29:39.93]You know, bits of string, leftover screws, random scraps of paper I find lying around the office.
[29:45.76]This morning I fed him something that said, D to the United States of America.
[29:50.22]It looked tasty.
[29:52.62]Don't do that again.
[29:54.24]Why would I ever do that again?
[29:56.82]There's no reason for me to do that again.
[30:00.08]Now all those poor bloggers have to stand on street corners telling passing strangers what TV shows they like to watch.
[30:07.12]Do it again.
[30:08.10]Alright.
[30:08.44]Well, if you're gonna ask me to do it again, you're gonna pressure me into doing it.
[30:12.01]Maybe I guess I will.
[30:15.87]Well, what do you know?
[30:16.59]The crucial piece of evidence in the Hudson River Merman Strangler case.
[30:21.01]I'll have to remember to file that once we're done with this case.
[30:26.35]Don't do it.
[30:27.01]Alright, fine.
[30:27.81]I won't.
[30:28.37]If people don't want me to do it, then I just won't.
[30:30.23]If people ask me to do something, viewers, you know, you guys, I listen to your opinions, so I won't do it.
[30:37.90]Okay.
[31:04.18]Alright, well, is this gonna hurt me?
[31:05.76]Uh, hello, uh, Sam?
[31:06.24]Uh, this is Sybil.
[31:07.12]I think I'm Prego, and you're the responsible party.
[31:25.86]Sibyl must have a cold or something.
[31:27.88]No kidding.
[31:28.88]Did she say she thought she was a jar of spaghetti sauce?
[31:31.00]This game really has kind of dialed it up a little here.
[31:34.52]Rig the answering machine to shock them when they play the third message.
[31:39.21]Didn't I just do that though?
[31:40.41]This is the third message.
[32:00.16]So that's the third message.
[32:02.78]Why didn't I get electrocuted?
[32:05.48]Oh, it was shocking.
[32:07.58]I get it.
[32:07.88]Okay.
[32:07.98]I thought I was going to get electrocuted.
[32:09.62]Alright, well, let's just go back so we can get entrance to the Prisma Zone, whatever the hell it is.
[32:37.16]I didn't get it either.
[32:39.86]So, see?
[32:42.86]With a little sad face.
[32:44.52]Back to the moon.
[32:45.78]Okay.
[33:05.51]So, let's go bring the unicorn.
[33:09.15]Footprint, what's that?
[33:09.89]No, it's not.
[33:10.37]That looks like my feet, with a shoe on.
[33:12.15]Alright, let's get access here.
[33:14.42]Uh, let us in.
[33:16.38]Have you achieved level red yet?
[33:31.55]I'm utterly flabbergasted, sir.
[33:33.13]I'd suspect a trick, but surely no level red prismatologist would stoop so low.
[33:37.56]We never stoop.
[33:38.58]We're posture freaks.
[33:40.22]Enjoy the retreat, brothers.
[33:41.36]Alright.
[33:44.95]Up or down?
[33:45.57]Is it gonna go up or down?
[33:49.19]Oh, we don't even get to see.
[33:51.93]Sam!
[33:52.49]Sam!
[33:52.93]There he is!
[33:53.73]It's Hugh Bliss!
[33:55.21]Hi, I'm Hugh Bliss.
[33:57.01]Hi, Hugh Bliss.
[33:58.15]Hi, Hugh Bliss.
[33:59.87]Hi, Hugh Bliss.
[34:02.04]I so hope you're enjoying my blister of tranquility.
[34:05.88]You're all making such great progress unlocking the secrets of prismatology, and I couldn't be more delighted.
[34:13.42]Neither could I. Cool it, Max.
[34:15.12]You're scaring me more than usual.
[34:17.01]I have splendid news!
[34:19.09]My top secret plan to hypnotize the entire world is nearly complete.
[34:25.53]Soon, everyone on Earth will become one of us.
[34:29.39]None shall escape.
[34:31.43]It'll be fabulous.
[34:35.11]You're a good man.
[34:36.25]He looks like one of those robots.
[34:38.39]With all the skin peeled off.
[34:41.11]And he just has any metal in the eyes.
[34:44.41]This guy really knows how to work a room.
[34:47.36]Keep up the great work, everyone!
[34:49.00]I'm tickled pink!
[34:50.92]Ha-ha!
[34:52.00]An entire planet of prismatologists!
[34:54.80]It's like a dream!
[34:56.38]It's a dream where you wake up screaming with a gun in your hand, your pillow torn to shreds, and the upstairs neighbors calling 911.
[35:02.85]That's right!
[35:03.49]The best kind!
[35:04.83]P.S.
[35:05.27]Please don't come into my inner sanctum.
[35:06.99]Thank you!
[35:09.90]Well, here we go.
[35:10.50]We have a very large area here.
[35:14.08]Giant spork, statue, Lincoln, water cooler.
[35:17.50]Oh.
[35:20.00]Tell a water cooler joke?
[35:20.64]I don't have any.
[35:38.14]Look, Max, it's the giant stone head of your old opponent, Abraham Lincoln.
[35:42.24]Welcome, brethren, to the blister of... Oh, it's you two.
[35:46.17]Not so tough without your fancy giant robot body, are you?
[35:49.97]I can still bite off your fluffy little... I mean... Let me help you, brother, to overcome the orange of confrontation and bathe in the yellow of peace and brotherhood.
[36:04.29]Okay, is Prismatology helping you?
[36:06.27]No, he's talking about farting.
[36:07.35]No.
[36:30.96]Max and I are always looking for new ways to make people throw up.
[36:33.94]Teach us.
[36:34.96]Please.
[36:35.74]As it is now, I can make people vomit with every part of my body except my mind.
[36:40.85]Well, if you are a true prismatologist, I suppose I'm obliged to help you.
[36:46.95]But there's a problem.
[36:48.45]I accidentally swallowed the gastrokinesis talisman.
[36:52.11]Sam, is that ironic or sarcastic?
[36:54.89]It's pretty damned inconvenient.
[36:58.53]Throw up that talisman.
[37:00.39]Can't you make yourself throw up the gastrokinesis talisman?
[37:03.01]With gastrokinesis?
[37:03.93]I haven't thrown up since 1863.
[37:06.65]Right after I gave the Gettysburg Address.
[37:09.03]I was kind of nervous that day.
[37:10.71]I didn't have anything prepared.
[37:13.82]Hmm.
[37:15.36]Okay.
[37:15.60]So long, Mr. Lincoln.
[37:17.66]So we have to make Lincoln throw up.
[37:21.36]And we do that not exactly sure how.
[37:23.50]Is a rainbow supposed to be going in or coming out?
[37:25.74]I think it depends on which way you're facing.
[37:30.24]Alright, spork.
[37:33.28]Statue.
[37:36.60]I think that's the biggest, meanest-looking spork I ever saw outside of Chicago.
[37:40.59]Okay.
[37:47.23]This place is kind of freaking me out, though.
[37:48.77]This is like the weirdest portion of the game.
[37:52.70]You must be at least this tall to ride this ride.
[37:55.64]Fascist oppressors!
[38:03.77]alright so the roller coaster goes around through his mouth right where does it end up alright so max get in there please keep your arms and legs in the ride at all times so alright here we go
[38:41.35]Did he take a photo of you?
[38:48.35]That's a source engine door, yeah.
[38:50.19]So we're gonna have to do something with that.
[38:53.76]Whatever that is, I'm not sure.
[38:54.96]Alright, the chicken.
[39:09.47]I'm beginning to think we already know everyone on the moon.
[39:12.14]How are you, Mr. Featherly?
[39:13.80]Oh, for heaven's sake!
[39:15.92]My name is not Featherly.
[39:18.60]It's Philo Pennyworth.
[39:20.88]Featherly is the name of my former television character.
[39:24.44]Have you no ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality?
[39:28.08]Well... What's so important about that, anyway?
[39:32.94]Um... Why prismatology?
[39:35.36]Kevin Bacon's a prismatologist?
[39:37.36]Add it to the wiki.
[39:56.41]How's the show doing?
[39:56.97]How's Midtown Cowboys doing these days?
[39:59.11]You mean you don't even know?
[40:01.57]The show was canceled almost immediately after your first and only appearance.
[40:06.33]All that flap over the tabloid photos of you two with that alien brought the censors down on us.
[40:12.27]That was no alien.
[40:13.50]It was Hugh Bliss.
[40:15.04]The show was ruined, and my career along with it.
[40:18.92]Okay.
[40:20.62]We've got a president right here.
[40:22.78]I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
[40:27.66]Alright, what's with the hat?
[40:28.34]What's with the hat?
[40:29.52]I'm pursuing new opportunities in the entertainment field.
[40:33.26]Can you make- What are you pulling rabbits out of it?
[40:35.72]Rats!
[40:37.18]Or at least I'm trying to.
[40:42.96]What?
[40:43.84]Drat.
[40:45.67]What the hell was that?
[40:48.43]I gather the rat out of the hat trick isn't going so well?
[40:51.13]The principles involved are quite simple.
[40:53.47]I could even teach them to adult like you.
[40:56.39]Now, hold on a minute.
[40:58.12]But I'm having trouble getting the rat all the way out.
[41:00.80]It appears to be stuck.
[41:04.46]How long has the rat been stuck in the hat?
[41:06.90]You misunderstand.
[41:07.95]The rat is not actually in the hat.
[41:10.05]It's stuck somewhere else.
[41:11.73]The hat is acting as a dimensional portal to wherever the rat happens to be.
[41:16.15]Wow.
[41:17.13]Is it magic or science?
[41:19.06]Is there really any difference?
[41:20.04]He's holding on to the...
[41:23.18]Okay, so that, I gotta get him off the meter.
[41:29.24]Would you teach me how to pull a rat out of a hat?
[41:31.46]Prismatology instructs us to share.
[41:33.74]Rat on the meter.
[41:35.34]But I've simply got to perform the trick successfully myself first.
[41:39.65]I can't have you scooping me.
[41:41.73]No, I guess not.
[41:43.85]Okay.
[41:44.63]Catch you later, feather.
[41:45.49]Things to do, right?
[41:46.11]Let's get a task list here.
[41:51.27]Make President Lincoln throw up Get the rat off of the meter That's two tasks And how to get rat off meter
[42:07.54]Well, here's a shark.
[42:09.29]Here are the computers.
[42:11.63]What are you doing here?
[42:12.63]Hey, Max, is that our bug?
[42:14.87]Hey, Max, is that our bug?
[42:17.07]He's still got it.
[42:18.57]Thank you.
[42:19.75]You're a prismatologist, too?
[42:21.76]Yes, I am.
[42:23.12]I'm so happy I could puke rainbows.
[42:25.92]Rainbows!
[42:27.44]Uh, we'll just keep our distance, then.
[42:29.10]Are you actually gonna puke?
[42:33.28]Hi, what is this game?
[42:33.86]This is Sam and Max.
[42:34.70]Season one, this is the last episode of season one.
[42:36.96]There are two more seasons after this.
[42:38.38]We're just cleaning up season one.
[42:39.70]This is the final episode.
[42:55.51]They don't sound very happy to see us.
[42:56.53]So much louder than everybody else.
[42:57.85]You destroyed Reality 2.0.
[43:00.93]Destroy!
[43:02.71]Remember your bliss.
[43:04.09]Adopt a more positive attitude now.
[43:08.67]Hmm.
[43:10.51]Are you gonna do Season 2 and Season 3?
[43:13.47]Um, probably.
[43:14.45]Okay.
[43:17.23]These games are really fun to just chill and hang out and play.
[43:22.93]So, they're very relaxing.
[43:24.28]They're fun.
[43:27.45]It's fun to hang out and just chill with chat and play a game.
[43:30.97]And they do that very, very well.
[43:35.50]Uh, do the motivational song.
[43:44.68]I do I really have to click this?
[43:46.10]I guess I do.
[43:48.57]Might as well listen to it.
[43:52.67]I didn't tell you for how long.
[43:53.53]This has taught us we no longer need self-reinforcement.
[43:58.11]We have luck inside ourselves.
[44:00.63]And we totally rock!
[44:03.87]I don't need to do that anymore.
[44:05.49]Sorry, guys.
[44:09.44]I tried.
[44:13.12]Is prismatology teaching you anything?
[44:16.56]That one's my favorite.
[44:18.00]It sounds like he's always cursing.
[44:20.13]That is because he is.
[44:22.38]We're learning the most powerful skill of them all, the power to see within ourselves to become the best we can be.
[44:31.42]Alright, so what's their shtick?
[44:34.60]What are your computers doing?
[44:35.68]Puke, magic, and what?
[44:36.86]Prismatology has restored our sense of purpose.
[44:40.56]After you destroyed Reality 2.0, we banded together to make a newer, even better game.
[44:46.85]Coming soon.
[44:47.95]It will rock your world!
[44:50.25]You came to a private retreat on the moon to work on something as insubstantial as a video game?
[44:55.44]Not just any game.
[44:57.32]We are creating the most advanced AI in history.
[45:01.58]In a world where two forces battle for domination of a war-torn landscape, only one will draw the line and reign supreme.
[45:10.14]Do you get to shoot stuff?
[45:11.50]It's not a good game until you get to shoot stuff.
[45:14.15]Thank you for your feedback.
[45:16.39]We will incorporate shooting into version 2.0.
[45:19.45]Can we try it?
[45:22.85]Okay.
[45:23.33]Max and I will try out this video game of yours.
[45:25.61]Prepare to suffer extreme humiliation!
[45:29.20]The year is 2048.
[45:31.00]In a post-apocalyptic galaxy run by giant corporations, you are a cybernetically enhanced space marine with no memory of his past.
[45:39.22]We actually have to play this?
[45:40.08]Are you the chosen one foretold by prophecy?
[45:42.84]Do you have the strength to survive?
[45:48.15]Oh, no.
[45:51.70]Shit.
[45:51.98]I have to play tic-tac-toe?
[45:53.56]I'm so bad at tic-tac-toe.
[45:56.12]You've played against me before as a whole collective chat.
[45:58.82]I'm not very good.
[46:02.08]I won.
[46:02.84]Actually, I just kind of did.
[46:07.00]Yeah, roar.
[46:10.77]By your calculations, your chances of winning were 1 in 10 trillion.
[46:15.92]The sun was in my eyes!
[46:17.78]Thank you for playing Tic Tac Doom.
[46:20.26]We'll continue to look within ourselves and improve our award-winning AI to make it even more challenging.
[46:26.14]It was too short and not hard enough.
[46:28.24]I want my money back!
[46:29.56]Please try again later.
[46:31.52]What's the point of doing that, though?
[46:35.80]Hmm.
[46:37.18]There has to be a reason to do that.
[46:40.49]Alright, anyways, I've got... Anything else in here?
[46:44.15]I've got to get the rat off the parking meter.
[46:49.02]That's priority number one.
[46:53.48]Shades of Albert Hoffman.
[46:55.18]Is he the fat one?
[46:56.48]I love that show!
[46:57.70]Okay, let's go back down.
[47:05.95]Let's see if I can get the rat off.
[47:16.50]What is this?
[47:16.94]Oh, okay.
[47:18.40]This is what's inside that door.
[47:20.00]This is the inner sanctum, right?
[47:22.16]So how do I... I wonder how I get through that door eventually.
[47:50.26]I probably have to pretend to be Hublis or something.
[47:55.82]Menacing.
[47:59.86]How long have I been live?
[48:01.68]Why wasn't I warned?
[48:04.34]And I drunkenly said last night that I wasn't gonna stream till Tuesday.
[48:11.75]But I woke up and I was alright, so... I'm not gonna stream till Tuesday!
[48:27.03]But I got stuff to do tomorrow so that was why I said that if I woke up all Messed up and feel like shit this morning this afternoon.
[48:34.01]I would probably be able to so But hey, we're here Alright, let's get the rat off of the parking meter How do we do that?
[48:49.96]Since Max and I never pay for parking anyway, those things just get in the way.
[48:53.32]I'll just shoot it.
[48:58.04]Can I just shoot him off?
[48:59.12]Scare him?
[48:59.80]Better not.
[49:03.24]So what's his deal?
[49:05.16]That meter's been out of order for years.
[49:07.16]Just because it ain't white, that don't mean people don't put money in it.
[49:11.41]It's like an HMO.
[49:13.31]Money, so he... Give it up, Jimmy.
[49:15.49]Not a chance.
[49:17.84]Give it up, Jimmy.
[49:19.08]Not a chance!
[49:22.08]Hmm.
[49:24.64]OK.
[49:25.10]I need money.
[49:38.13]Hey, Jimmy, want to touch my unicorn?
[49:39.89]Eat it!
[49:41.47]No, just touch it.
[49:42.93]Bam!
[49:53.13]Oh, did I miss anything in here?
[49:58.33]I need money.
[49:59.27]I need, like, coins or... Can I have one?
[50:10.05]So how do I make him puke?
[50:18.54]How do I make Lincoln puke a hundred trillion dollars?
[50:28.08]Sibyl?
[50:28.68]Maybe Sibyl has something to do.
[50:30.50]Sibyl just kind of said, I'm the queen of Canada.
[50:32.47]And that was it.
[50:41.45]Alright, Sibyl.
[50:52.83]Let's talk about this.
[50:54.66]What do you think of this?
[50:55.98]Hey, Sybil.
[50:56.68]Wanna rub my unicorn?
[50:58.18]We have people who do that sort of thing for us now.
[51:02.56]Hiya, Sybil.
[51:05.36]If you're Queen of Canada, how come you're still down here in the States?
[51:08.62]Are you kidding?
[51:09.56]It's freezing up there.
[51:11.24]We love our country, but we've gotta draw the line somewhere.
[51:14.22]Okay.
[51:16.20]Have you come up with any brilliant ideas for improving Canada?
[51:19.14]Nothing solid yet.
[51:20.75]We've thought of a new slogan.
[51:22.91]Canada.
[51:24.09]It's surprisingly pleasant.
[51:26.39]But we need something bigger.
[51:28.10]Something to really put us on the map.
[51:30.48]Something daring.
[51:31.46]I need a better, bigger slogan.
[51:36.73]Have you come up with any brilliant ideas for improving Canada?
[51:39.71]Nothing solid yet.
[51:41.28]Hmm, a lot of open books that I can't close right now.
[51:44.78]Show the unicorn?
[51:45.68]I tried to show the unicorn.
[51:46.58]She just said no.
[52:07.77]So I need a new Canadian slogan.
[52:10.09]Abraham Lincoln puke.
[52:11.93]Rat off the parking bin.
[52:17.59]Maybe if I bring Abraham Lincoln, like, old nachos?
[52:20.21]Wait, wait, wait.
[52:20.57]What about in here?
[52:23.45]This place should be open.
[52:28.92]Is that a cat tray full of kitty litter?
[52:30.98]Lefties is empty again.
[52:32.10]No.
[52:32.50]Except for the lingering stench, of course.
[52:36.76]Let's go back to Bosco's.
[52:48.42]Come on, Max.
[52:50.18]Hurry up.
[52:59.69]Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[53:00.43]Bring him, like, old, gross nachos or, like, a rotten hot dog.
[53:07.91]Let me talk to you.
[53:09.69]I could use a hint.
[53:10.95]Help me out with something.
[53:12.31]Sure.
[53:13.99]Um... We can just get hints.
[53:21.20]I won at Tic Tac Doom, but it didn't do any good.
[53:23.78]Winning isn't everything, Sam.
[53:26.42]Okay.
[53:31.33]Never mind.
[53:32.95]Alright, what about... Do you want to see this?
[53:36.69]Alright, so don't win in tic-tac-toe.
[53:48.08]Let's try it.
[53:48.72]Let's try losing.
[53:55.10]So my confidence is gone because I thought I just beat the computer.
[53:58.99]Turns out you're not supposed to beat the computer.
[54:06.50]Where are we headed now, Sam?
[54:08.26]Let's go, Luz.
[54:08.80]To the moon, Alice.
[54:13.06]Where's the laptop?
[54:15.56]Did it last night.
[54:16.25]It's already done.
[54:19.63]Should be an eight-hour VOD for you.
[54:22.39]From last night.
[54:25.33]Whee!
[54:26.69]Alright, let's go.
[54:35.69]He ate it.
[54:38.16]Eight hours for a four-hour total build.
[54:40.40]That was actually a five-hour total build.
[54:46.30]But drinking a bottle of wine and talking about like VR and... If I sat there quiet, I could have probably done it in fucking three hours.
[54:57.96]It's the experience.
[54:59.02]Lavo is my favorite game.
[55:00.72]Okay?
[55:02.06]Don't take that from me.
[55:03.98]Let me have that one.
[55:04.80]That's my favorite thing.
[55:08.40]Okay, uh, let's lose TikTok.
[55:14.62]We'd like to try out that video game of yours again.
[55:16.70]This time you will be annihilated!
[55:19.39]The box says one hour.
[55:20.99]No, it does not.
[55:22.09]It actually says 180 minutes.
[55:23.29]You will fail!
[55:26.59]The headset is 30 to 60 and the blaster is 180.
[55:29.83]You do the math.
[55:30.31]Alright, can you beat me?
[55:32.17]He can't win.
[55:32.89]No, I don't want to win.
[55:36.81]I have to try to lose.
[55:57.44]Alright, I lose.
[55:58.54]I lose.
[55:58.84]That's it.
[55:59.54]No!
[55:59.84]It doesn't matter, I still lose.
[56:10.45]Yeah, I lose.
[56:27.09]They were destroyed!
[56:30.47]Oh, darn.
[56:31.45]You beat me fair and square.
[56:33.67]Good game.
[56:34.91]I totally beat you guys!
[56:37.18]Our journey of personal awareness is now complete.
[56:40.02]Now what?
[56:40.46]We have mastered the most advanced artificial intelligence ever created.
[56:45.68]You suck so bad, LOL!
[56:48.38]Let me try, Sam.
[56:49.54]I know I can take him.
[56:51.14]A super sophisticated AI entity... Brother.
[56:55.08]You suck so bad.
[56:59.17]During the Mordhau stream, I looked over and definitely saw that at least ten times.
[57:02.77]You suck so bad.
[57:03.41]It would have been better.
[57:25.49]It would've been better if the computer thing said, How can you be this bad?
[57:30.86]I see that one a lot, too.
[57:35.96]How is it possible to be this bad?
[57:39.21]If you said that, it would've been great.
[57:40.57]Alright, so now I have a Lead Vision Talisman.

[61:07.59]I need- uh, there's also the spoon that I need to steal.
[61:29.99]I don't have anything to stop him.
[61:35.08]Can I put lead in his face?
[61:37.42]I keep trying to walk out.
[61:38.72]I can't just walk out?
[61:58.92]What, you're telling me I just can't slide like a DVD player into my pants and walk out?
[62:06.09]Why not?
[62:06.67]It really should work on securing this thing better.
[62:23.85]Hilarious as it would be to mix up the displays, I've got better things to do.
[62:27.24]Like what?
[62:28.56]Shut up, bonehead.
[62:31.84]Can I, like, throw it?
[62:33.52]What if I just turn and just fucking baseball through it into the space?
[62:40.63]I'll need to get the case off it first.
[62:43.15]Yeah, like, throw it.
[62:45.09]One moment, please.
[62:47.83]I have no idea how that keeps winding up in there.
[62:50.52]Don't get cute.
[62:53.05]Okay, what if I hand it back to him?
[62:56.01]Someone tried to steal this.
[63:00.67]They really should work on securing this thing better.
[63:09.23]One moment, please.
[63:11.93]I have no idea.
[63:13.33]Too late.
[63:19.43]Hold on, wait.
[63:21.14]They really should work on securing this thing better.
[63:27.48]Here, Max, hold this.
[63:30.12]Oh, he can eat it.
[63:31.06]Alright, we got it.
[63:35.24]One moment, please.
[63:38.88]Okay, go ahead.
[63:41.67]Alright, now spit it out.
[63:47.75]Could I have that display case you ate?
[63:49.61]Can you wait 12 to 72 hours?
[63:52.57]72 hours?
[63:57.07]That's some slow-ass metabolism.
[63:59.39]Alright.
[64:08.28]Yeah, now, now, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[64:18.46]How fast do you digest metal?
[64:20.01]After I gave the Gettysburg Address.
[64:22.69]What if I get the Gettysburg Address?
[64:41.99]You're not still bitter about the election, are you?
[64:44.30]Or your public humiliation?
[64:45.88]Or the cruise missile that blew your body to tiny wig bits?
[64:49.00]I can't even hold it up in front of him?
[64:50.32]Heck no.
[64:51.00]Being president is for chumps.
[64:53.21]Only a grade-A sociopathic masochist would want that thankless job.
[64:57.63]Grade-A?
[64:58.87]I'm flattered.
[65:02.10]Why the long marble face?
[65:03.84]Because you two made me lose something more valuable than an election.
[65:08.52]My one chance at true love.
[65:10.42]This is all happening so fast.
[65:12.80]I don't know what to say.
[65:14.39]Not you, moron.
[65:16.55]I'm talking about that radiant vision of beauty you had interrupt my family value speech.
[65:23.05]You mean Sybil?
[65:24.39]Is that her name?
[65:25.63]Sybil?
[65:26.93]It's like a chorus of angels.
[65:29.25]I'm doing like a rap song.
[65:32.01]You know when like a lot of raps out, they just, somebody else will say the lines too.
[65:36.33]For like one line in the beginning.
[65:44.79]There'll be a verse and then somebody will just like say two lines with them and then two lines at the end.
[65:56.37]Or they'll do it again over the same track.
[66:02.72]It's called accenting.
[66:04.10]Yeah.
[66:05.38]That's what I was doing.
[66:06.02]Okay.
[66:32.61]We can give you Sybil's phone number so you can set up a date.

[72:12.98]Interesting.
[72:13.50]Okay.
[72:18.18]Pretty zoomed out for that.
[72:25.80]So, can I make anyone... Can I make everybody throw up?
[72:28.62]Alright, how do I... I need to break this.
[72:30.32]Can I break it?
[72:31.02]Throw it in here?
[72:31.96]Alright, well, let's go make the chicken throw up.
[72:35.68]Might as well make everybody puke.
[73:00.22]We might get something.
[73:00.98]Aww.
[73:02.66]That's too bad.
[73:03.34]Okay, so now I have the... display case.
[73:04.66]I need to get the case off.
[73:07.77]Can I just break it?
[73:09.79]You've thrown up...
[73:34.22]I think it only works on things with stomachs.
[73:38.78]Wait, can I make myself puke?
[73:40.20]Not happening.
[73:44.12]I can't shoot it.
[73:51.44]Well, let's go see if we can make anybody else throw up.
[74:01.41]Like you, for instance.
[74:04.24]I'm not particularly interested in seeing the contents of his stomach.
[74:07.12]Okay, what about you?
[74:13.58]I'm not particularly... No.
[74:17.07]I need to break this case open.
[74:25.91]Can I stomp on it?
[74:28.29]Crush it?
[74:29.54]I'll need to get the case off at first.
[74:38.16]It's pretty skinky.
[74:39.48]I think I'll just leave it alone forever.
[74:40.90]I need a battery.
[74:45.39]Hold on.
[74:53.27]Can I... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[74:56.01]I can't break it on the spork.
[74:58.05]But maybe can I... Can I break it?
[75:02.43]Can I make it... Hold on.
[75:07.81]I'll need to get the case off it first.
[75:09.59]Damn it, really?
[75:11.31]I'll need to get the ca- I figured I could just throw it in there.
[75:13.81]I'll need to get the case off it.
[75:28.02]Whee!
[75:28.14]I missed a bowling ball, too.
[75:33.70]Can I just have Abe crush it with his teeth?
[75:40.53]I just need to drop it.
[75:42.41]Drop it out the window?
[75:43.25]Just drop it out the window of the office and it'll just break?
[75:52.72]That makes sense.
[76:02.98]Can I turn this on?
[76:14.81]Lunar Lander.
[76:17.92]Whose is this?
[76:29.66]Really?
[76:30.00]That seems way too over the top to work.
[76:39.89]Why would I just drop it?
[76:49.41]it's a cartoon yeah I know but I mean wait I can go up here hey the keys are locked inside so many of us are like god damn it really how do I get in there hmm nothing happened let's come on the same man of lead hmm nothing happened
[77:21.26]The keys are locked inside.
[77:24.45]Damn.
[77:25.13]Okay.
[77:25.53]I have to get in there somehow.
[77:31.87]Can't, like, bust out the window?
[77:33.25]Shit.
[77:34.76]Ah!
[77:48.30]I can't, uh, when he, when I go up here, he goes up and... The key's locked inside.
[77:53.76]Do I need, like, a coat hanger?
[77:55.08]Is there... Is the coat hanger in the office always?
[78:13.15]Where are we headed now, Sam?
[78:15.45]I'm going to get a coat hanger.
[78:19.02]There's one in the TV, always.
[78:39.43]Perfect co-op Jupiter.
[78:42.97]There it is.
[78:47.05]Sam, without that, we can't watch Colonel Mudshanks' monkey party tonight.
[78:50.98]They were going to vote somebody out of the monkey house.
[78:53.32]It's for the good of the planet.
[78:55.14]And besides, you had Colonel Mudshanks exiled for treason, remember?
[79:02.01]Alright.
[79:02.63]Let's get in there.
[79:03.63]Open it up.
[79:04.59]Keys.
[79:04.95]Can you crack me up, little buddy?
[79:18.48]Where are we headed now, Sam?
[79:21.02]To the moon.
[79:21.92]To the moon, Alice.
[79:25.11]Can you crack me up, little buddy?
[79:30.91]Can you crack me up, little buddy?
[79:34.92]Okay.
[79:38.32]Coat hanger.
[79:40.10]Lander door.
[79:43.88]Unlock, grab key, turn on, get spoon.
[79:47.69]And then I have no idea what to do after that.
[79:49.61]But we're going to do it really relaxed.
[79:53.59]We're going to hang out and have fun.
[79:59.75]Where did we go?
[80:00.71]Are we going to a new place?
[80:07.81]Oh, he's dead.
[80:09.82]I think the controls don't work how they're supposed to.
[80:15.24]Alright, so now I've got the spoon.
[80:19.21]For which, what can I do?
[80:20.77]Bend the spoon, and then... So, use the spoon on the big spoon.
[80:24.75]And bend it, for some reason.
[80:25.95]Okay.
[80:48.07]I mean, that's very clearly just a please come over here and use this item on me.
[80:54.61]Giant spoon.
[80:56.47]Here we go.
[80:59.91]Alright, now that's going to... We're going to crash when we're on the rollercoaster.
[81:07.92]So, turn on the rollercoaster.
[81:09.84]I have to car crash.
[81:14.68]Should we be in it?
[81:19.76]Am I gonna get a game over?
[81:24.70]Did I save the game?
[81:31.74]We're gonna die!
[81:33.22]Oh.
[81:33.34]What?
[81:51.06]What?
[82:00.76]What did that do?
[82:02.96]What was the purpose of bending the spoon?
[82:08.41]I think that's the biggest, meanest... Can I go the other way?
[82:18.01]No.
[82:18.59]I wonder if I can maybe turn the... Maybe have it... No.
[82:20.67]Just gonna keep it bent.
[82:23.89]Okay.
[82:29.58]So now... I should be able to go up here.
[82:34.46]Was there anything else that was... bendable?
[82:39.39]This is definitely bendable.
[82:43.33]Neat.
[82:48.92]Yeah, definitely.
[82:52.49]That was cool, but I hope it didn't hurt the bowling ball.
[82:59.88]There he is!
[83:00.66]He is!
[83:01.81]Jigs up, Hublis.
[83:03.09]We've come a long way for this, my friend.
[83:05.27]So buckle up, because the freelance police are taking you downtown.
[83:10.17]Hi, I'm Hublis.
[83:12.11]He is.
[83:13.05]You're just in time for the show.
[83:15.05]Please, no flash photography.
[83:16.91]Ahem.
[83:17.59]People of Earth.
[83:20.28]Hi, I'm Hublis.
[83:22.48]And now, so are you.
[83:34.09]Oh, shit.
[83:35.72]You opened up the portal to Tristram.
[83:39.24]You better go in there and save Deckard Cain while there's still time.
[83:43.09]What have you done?
[83:44.49]Oh, just enlisted a few billion followers.
[83:48.01]Touch me and you'll have quite a happy, angry mob on your hands.
[83:52.41]Not if we... Reverse the effects of the hypno-beam?
[83:55.06]I don't think so.
[83:56.62]For in all the universe, there's only one force chaotic and destructive enough to stop me now.
[84:02.10]But you wouldn't do that, would you, Max?
[84:04.68]Who, me?
[84:06.01]Well, I'm...
[84:07.23]I'm flattered, but... No, you wouldn't.
[84:10.21]Because I'm going to.
[84:11.87]Drum roll, please.
[84:18.56]Really?
[84:19.20]What does that even mean?
[84:20.58]It means I chop off every part of you I don't like.
[84:23.64]It's like circumcision, but double the laughs.
[84:26.56]Hey!
[84:27.84]Wait, what?
[84:28.50]Here we go.
[84:29.80]Goodbye, murderous hand.
[84:33.73]Goodbye, gluttonous stomach.
[84:37.69]Goodbye, slothful tail!
[84:43.00]Ow!
[84:43.80]And with those naughty body parts, your vices are purged from your soul!
[84:49.10]Bye-bye!
[84:53.59]Thanks for the hand, jerkbag!
[84:55.73]I'm gonna use it to shoot you all!
[85:00.92]Oh boy, a stomach.
[85:02.98]Just what I always wanted.
[85:04.52]Now come here and let me eat you.
[85:10.89]Great, a tail.
[85:13.63]I just want to lie in front of a TV till I die in a pool of my own slobber.
[85:17.96]This is that movie.
[85:19.76]What's the movie?
[85:21.44]Up?
[85:21.60]No.
[85:21.90]What's it called?
[85:23.04]The movie with the emotions?
[85:26.58]Go away, rotten Maxis.
[85:28.35]I don't like you.
[85:29.87]Inside out.
[85:30.93]Now nothing can stop me.
[85:32.75]I win.
[85:33.67]Okay, bye now.
[85:36.49]Oh, yes, my children.
[85:38.54]Let me soak in your happiness.
[85:40.70]Oh, yes.
[85:42.40]More.
[85:43.50]Oh, yes.
[85:44.82]So good.
[85:46.44]Oh, my.
[85:46.74]So happy.
[85:49.75]Max, are you okay?
[85:51.09]Help me grab that ponytail freak show and reverse the effects of the beam.
[85:54.65]But Sam, I love that ponytail freak show.
[85:59.29]I want to have his love child.
[86:01.97]No!
[86:04.80]Bad end.
[86:05.88]I swear to you, I'll get your vices back or kill us both trying.
[86:10.44]I love you too.
[86:15.82]Well, okay.
[86:19.43]He still has fun doing that.
[86:20.53]Alright, we've got public address microphone.
[86:23.83]The view screen.
[86:24.93]I can see the retreat from here.
[86:26.67]Apparently Mr. Mindreader has to keep tabs on his followers the old-fashioned way.
[86:30.83]What?
[86:31.25]Nothing.
[86:33.65]Wait, what?
[86:35.33]These crystals must operate something important.
[86:38.16]Nope, I just think they look pretty.
[86:40.32]A bit cliche if you ask me.
[86:42.00]What?
[86:42.40]Nothing.
[86:42.68]Okay.
[86:47.12]Don't worry, people of Earth.
[86:49.62]I'm working as hard as I can to break the spell and make you all miserable again.
[86:53.32]Wait, where's my bug?
[86:58.87]Can I get him to save anything?
[87:04.49]Lunar lander key... spoon... wait.
[87:06.71]It's worth a shot.
[87:11.24]Can I turn these off?
[87:12.86]Alright.
[87:13.04]So, turns out you... I can't do anything about that.
[87:14.92]I'm going to have to eventually come to their terms off.
[87:17.84]Anything else that I missed over here?
[87:44.59]statues the view screen I think that's it let's just get out fix max is everybody here all screwed up
[88:11.48]Get him in the... Okay.
[88:12.36]Get him inside the rollercoaster car.
[88:14.77]Come here.
[88:15.21]Get in here.
[88:28.02]Not a very good shot.
[88:29.76]Alright, let's go.
[88:30.48]We're gonna go in the room.
[88:31.90]No, we can't get over there.
[88:56.52]But I can't, like, press the button?
[88:58.44]No.
[89:00.32]So we have to make somebody run around.
[89:01.93]Maybe I can tell Max to run around?
[89:12.51]We both suck.
[89:16.69]Hold on.
[89:17.09]Can I do it from here?
[89:18.69]Yes!
[89:33.84]He's gonna get hit in the face by the spoon!
[89:36.94]Wait, it's not bent!
[89:38.38]What?
[89:41.16]I bent it before!
[89:41.90]Did you have fun?
[89:48.65]I thought that- I bet- I didn't think I had to re-bend the spoon.
[89:55.53]I bent it before I went up to talk to Hugh Bliss.
[90:06.65]You suck so bad, Ella.
[90:13.77]Damn it.
[90:14.77]I can't see it from here.
[90:18.93]And then you unbent it.
[90:19.88]No, I bent it back, though.
[90:21.00]Check the VOD.
[90:21.52]I bent it back.
[90:23.66]I bent it back.
[90:24.86]I've got people that can vouch for that.
[90:26.48]I did bend it back.
[90:38.50]Check the bot, I did.
[90:40.52]I did bend it back.
[90:42.04]Wait, where is he?
[90:42.62]Why is he not in there?
[90:43.54]Wait, no, I gotta wait for him to go.
[90:45.10]Just go back in.
[90:46.89]I gotta wait till he jumps in.
[90:47.85]Do it now, come on, shoot it now.
[90:51.67]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[90:55.95]Alright, now we get to win.
[91:04.93]Here we go.
[91:05.45]Clothesline incoming.
[91:06.33]Three, two... Oh, it's the hand.
[91:09.21]I think that's what we needed.
[91:16.33]Does he die?
[91:20.10]Ha ha ha!
[91:39.61]Okay.
[91:40.97]So, we've got... Let's go out here.
[91:44.38]See what's going on outside.
[91:45.62]We have one of the three pieces we need of Max.
[91:53.66]Look, Max, it's another one of you.
[91:55.57]He made it 20 feet from the box before collapsing under the weight of his own laziness.
[92:00.01]Ennui is one of the five fundamental forces.
[92:03.07]He made it 20 feet.
[92:05.25]No TV?
[92:06.87]Why even go on?
[92:08.62]You should all just lie on your faces and wait for death.
[92:12.36]It's true.
[92:13.70]I got nothing.
[92:15.10]I'm a failure.
[92:16.14]I thought people were supposed to be happy out here.
[92:19.24]I'm on the verge of tears.
[92:20.69]This guy's the death of the party.
[92:24.35]What if it happened to people having a good time?
[92:26.31]Stuck to the ground?
[92:30.62]Aren't we on the moon?
[92:31.28]Wouldn't being on the moon make him lighter?
[92:55.69]I'm not particularly interested in seeing the... I don't think it works on people, except maybe if they're shaped like spoons.
[93:07.91]Hmm, okay.
[93:08.51]You have anything to say?
[93:11.11]Howdy, Superball.
[93:12.41]I can't talk now, sir.
[93:13.83]The blue guy is really getting me down.
[93:15.43]His supernatural lethargy is crushing my normally unbridled enthusiasm.
[93:19.20]But, Superball, you seem as chipper as ever.
[93:22.66]Thank you, sir.
[93:23.38]I work hard to put on a happy face, but I'm crying on the inside.
[93:29.45]What about you?
[93:30.01]Hi, Harry.
[93:33.51]I don't like this part.
[93:35.15]Turn it off.
[94:03.28]I can't turn it off.
[94:04.14]Alright, let's go... Wait.
[94:12.51]Can I put the bunny underneath here?
[94:16.63]Can I slide him over here?
[94:17.75]There it is.
[94:33.25]no no no no no no I'm just saying like he's lying on the ground maybe that'll make him get up I'll tell you what I mean wow I'll show you something here we finally get to bend it yes alright now we can call them pull them out of the house and I never pay for parking anyway
[95:01.77]That thing's been bent for a whole season.
[95:03.59]I'm so glad it finally fixed it.
[95:12.77]Okay.
[95:17.51]Holy heaping helpings of high-fructose corn syrup.
[95:19.89]He's eating everything inside.
[95:22.15]Bosco, do not freak out.
[95:24.54]Atta boy!
[95:25.56]Eat up, so you'll grow big and strong.
[95:28.52]What is the world coming to?
[95:30.30]Bosco, pass the knobs.
[95:31.70]Aisle four?
[95:33.93]Oh, my, that one does have an appetite.
[95:36.73]At the rate he's going, his stomach won't even fit back inside you.
[95:40.12]Make boss go puke.
[95:41.02]Nougat really is so good.
[95:42.35]It's so great.
[95:43.21]Alright, so, uh, get him to... We've got... What does he say?
[95:45.83]Excuse me, Mr. Vice Manifestation.
[96:12.34]You look delicious.
[96:14.62]Look, pal, I need your stomach so I can put my buddy back together.
[96:18.20]Hand it over and only one of us gets hurt.
[96:20.52]I can't resist the rich, meaty taste of dog and rabbit.
[96:26.05]Well, here we are in your stomach.
[96:27.41]What?
[96:27.55]What the hell did I just step in?
[96:30.01]I'm enjoying the womb-like meditative quality of the pyloric sphincter.
[96:34.49]Darn it.
[96:35.41]Well, I've still got my magic doohickey.
[96:42.41]Well, that was, uh, disgusting.
[96:43.25]Should we do it again?
[96:43.89]Turn this off!
[96:44.23]Um, okay, so... Hmm...
[97:12.61]I wonder, can I do anything else?
[97:14.09]Okay, we have to cover ourselves in something.
[97:29.39]Has to be.
[97:31.21]We have to cover ourselves in something he doesn't like.
[97:34.91]Roast coffee?
[97:39.76]Somehow we have to make him eat us again, but this time with a coating he doesn't like.
[97:44.28]I'm entranced by the gentle oscillation of the hot weenies.
[97:48.69]Yep, stole a garbage can.
[97:50.67]I can't take the weenies.
[97:56.35]Can I bend his stomach around?
[97:57.91]No.
[97:59.88]Well, I can go do the rabbit in the hat thing.
[98:10.66]Because the rat is off.
[98:12.64]I mean, the chicken... The arc of the chicken can finally be concluded.
[98:20.04]What about Sybil?
[98:24.34]We're here.
[98:24.76]Might as well just see.
[98:25.38]Okay.
[98:40.38]What's new?
[98:40.74]Oh, it's Abe Lincoln is here.
[98:42.20]This is horrific.
[99:05.55]Um, how will you improve Canada?
[99:07.71]Let's really get to the hard-hitting issues here.
[99:15.84]You've got to snap out of it.
[99:17.34]Snap out of what, friend Sam?
[99:19.44]For the first time in my life, I've got a perfect job, a rock-solid relationship, and an incomparable feeling of peace.
[99:29.46]I've never been so content in all my life.
[99:32.31]Don't worry, we'll fix that.
[99:35.60]Prismatology is a sham.
[99:36.98]This prismatology business is all a lie.
[99:39.66]Is pure happiness a lie?
[99:42.26]Is peace on Earth a hopeless dream?
[99:45.48]Are unicorns imaginary?
[99:48.10]Mostly, probably, and it depends on... Whoa, what the fuck?
[99:51.85]...from a facility that processes nuclear waste.
[99:56.79]Alright, how will you... How's the date?
[99:58.39]How's the date going with Lincoln?
[99:59.27]How's the date going with you and Mr. Lincoln?
[100:03.33]Isn't that right, Abraham?
[100:07.85]Pretty lady.
[100:10.93]He has such a way with words.
[100:13.73]Why is he like this now?
[100:14.67]What a smooth talker.
[100:19.09]I don't... Why is he doing this?
[100:20.64]Why is he like this?
[100:25.28]It sounds like Mr. Look at me, I wrote the Gettysburg Address isn't as good with words as he led us to believe.
[100:31.47]Are you two planning on having kids someday So long
[100:52.32]What's up, A.L.?
[100:53.28]How's the date going?
[100:54.72]Oh, thank goodness you two have come.
[100:56.52]Now we can talk.
[100:57.34]Well, hello, Mr. Lincoln.
[100:59.09]You're looking quite distinguished today.
[101:01.91]What's wrong with him?
[101:03.27]He hasn't been himself lately.
[101:05.03]Whatever.
[101:05.85]You've got to help me with this date.
[101:11.21]The honeymoon's already over?
[101:12.70]What's the problem?
[101:14.04]She's really into me.
[101:16.00]See there, Abraham?
[101:17.42]All it took was a little bit of courage.
[101:20.38]No, I mean really into me.
[101:23.14]She's so nice.
[101:25.68]It's giving me the creeps.
[101:28.50]I thought you'd be used to blissed-out people after spending so much time at the moon retreat.
[101:32.90]Sure, when you're around a bunch of other single guys, that's one thing.
[101:37.09]But this?
[101:38.29]What do I do if she wants to get intimate?
[101:40.89]I'm not cut out for this.
[101:41.95]There, there, Abraham.
[101:44.51]That's just the yellow of your cowardice speaking.
[101:47.76]Seriously, how long is it gonna be like this?
[101:50.20]I'm working on it.
[101:53.20]How did you avoid getting hit by Hugh Bliss's mind-altering happiness ray?
[101:57.32]I miss the great Blissification?
[101:59.90]Damn it!
[102:00.30]I knew I shouldn't have stopped by the gift shop on the way down here.
[102:05.44]Anything else?
[102:05.88]Do you know how to stop Hugh Bliss's world domination scheme?
[102:08.82]Why would I want to stop it?
[102:10.44]Under Hugh Bliss, all men are created equal.
[102:13.83]That's kind of my plan.
[102:16.26]You and Sybil should think about starting a family.
[102:18.50]This is all happening too fast.
[102:20.78]It's been over a hundred years.
[102:22.84]My stomach's doing backflips.
[102:24.80]I don't know what women like.
[102:26.50]Women like to be treated as equal partners in love and trust.
[102:30.84]A foundation of honesty that... Seriously, make him stop talking.
[102:35.25]I'm nauseated enough as it is.
[102:37.39]Rather romantic, Mr. Lincoln.
[102:41.81]Lucky at uniting a nation on the brink of war.
[102:44.91]Unlucky in love.
[102:47.08]You're ever the romantic.
[102:48.18]Okay.
[102:48.94]Anything else from Sybil?
[102:50.60]Before I go do the hat.
[102:52.56]I'm Hugh Bliss.
[102:55.54]Have you had any new ideas for improving Canada?
[102:57.94]With this new feeling of peace and tranquility, I feel like my mind is alive with possibilities.
[103:06.29]I only wish there was some way to extend this feeling of goodwill and generosity to all countries of the world.
[103:15.63]I always suspected that when the world turned nice and pleasant, Canada would be the first to fall.
[103:23.13]So long, Sybil.
[103:32.39]Ah, Sam.
[103:33.49]Hey.
[103:40.21]Alright.
[103:41.11]Let's go to the bird.
[103:43.77]Chicken with the hat.
[103:48.11]Can now do the trick.
[103:49.23]Which, I don't know what that gets us.
[103:58.08]I'm at that point in my... I was drinking coffee.
[104:01.44]Where it's just the ice.
[104:03.50]And the ice is slowly melted into that gross... Freezer taste.
[104:08.72]You know what I'm saying?
[104:10.84]When the ice cubes melt.
[104:12.96]And it's only that gross freezer water.
[104:14.72]I hate that.
[104:28.06]I gotta go refill it.
[104:30.29]Just don't drink iced coffee?
[104:31.57]I can't help it.
[104:32.79]I can't help it!
[104:33.67]I'm American!
[104:36.39]I read this somewhere.
[104:38.23]That it's only Americans put ice in everything.
[104:41.45]Is that true?
[104:42.35]Or did I get, like, Reddit lied to?
[104:43.64]Okay, so now you should be able to do it.
[104:54.03]How's it going?
[104:55.17]Hot coffee is better.
[104:58.53]I bet you don't even use the metric system.
[105:05.15]I don't use the metric system and I drink hot coffee all the time.
[105:08.65]I just like ice coffee.
[105:10.64]Oh, I just remembered.
[105:12.96]I can't stand rats.
[105:14.48]They're vile vermin.
[105:15.80]Smile when you say that, Beaky.
[105:18.44]Beaky?
[105:19.40]Sheesh.
[105:20.22]I hate this pulling out of the hat business.
[105:22.56]Next time, I'll find something better to hang on to.
[105:25.00]What was the purpose of this?
[105:26.94]Oh, dear.
[105:27.10]Do we get the hat?
[105:27.98]There won't be a next time.
[105:30.00]I shall never do this trick again.
[105:32.60]Only Americans expect genuine info from Reddit.
[105:34.66]If you would be so good as to remove the hat from my presence.
[105:38.22]Sure.
[105:40.35]Okay, so now I have a hat.
[105:43.19]So I have the magician's hat.
[105:47.67]Hmm.
[105:55.69]What am I pulling out of here?
[105:56.69]Okay, this is the... I got the rat.
[106:00.00]Now what if... I can put him somewhere?
[106:03.04]Yeah, I have a rat spawner.
[106:14.08]Reddit, the front page of America.
[106:15.74]It was like an Ask Reddit thing.
[106:19.78]It wasn't an article written by a scholar.
[106:21.74]It was just, hey, Reddit, do you put ice in your... Hey, Americans of Reddit, why do you put ice in everything?
[106:29.55]And then it was people doing the long things.
[106:31.43]One time when I was in Germany, I asked for ice and they looked at me strangely.
[106:36.79]It was like a bunch of those.
[106:43.79]That's, I'm telling you, that's how it works.
[106:45.49]Alright, what do I, okay, what do I do with the hat?
[106:49.25]Hmm.
[106:53.64]I have the moon key thing.
[106:57.22]Maybe, okay, I gotta pull a rat out.
[106:59.12]Does anyone not like rats?
[107:00.87]Can I make the rats, like, run somewhere?
[107:07.25]I got a lot of items.
[107:10.07]This makes people puke.
[107:10.99]I have a key to the moon thing.
[107:13.05]I can bend spoons with spoon-shaped devices, and now I can pull rats out of a hat.
[107:18.03]Let me go back up in that room up here.
[107:39.09]Okay, so... These five statues... Indestructible hues.
[107:52.24]Uh-oh, chat's being weird again.
[107:57.02]Prismatology is not the answer.
[108:00.93]Unless, I suppose, the question is, what's a really bad thing to believe in?
[108:06.86]Mrs. Betty Parkinson of 328 Cherry Lane, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA.
[108:12.17]You're our next contestant.
[108:14.13]Come on up to the moon.
[108:17.29]Attention.
[108:18.11]The owner of a Celestial Class Star Cruiser, license USS-1701C.
[108:24.25]Please report to the front desk.
[108:26.13]Your warp nacelles are on.
[108:29.65]I want Sam to read me audiobooks.
[108:33.17]And now, a medley of your lunar favorites.
[108:37.49]Oh, it's a callback I can see the whole thing from here I don't think I can do anything here
[109:03.15]Throw a rat at him?
[109:04.11]No.
[109:05.35]Maybe I can put a rat on the blue guy?
[109:07.29]Have him eat the rat?
[109:14.40]Just kill Hugh Bliss.
[109:17.62]That's not how it works.
[109:34.33]Okay.
[109:35.33]Rat.
[109:36.37]Will you move because of a rat?
[109:44.94]Nah.
[109:46.30]Okay.
[109:48.30]What about the unicorn?
[109:49.24]I'm just gonna exhaust all options.
[109:53.76]Do you like unicorns?
[109:58.63]Do you like... No, none of that stuff.
[110:03.63]Well, we're going to try to feed the rat.
[110:09.30]To the green.
[110:11.34]Hungry, Max.
[110:12.08]Nervous.
[110:20.69]Ah, the brute force strategy.
[110:23.43]Brute force strategy is a lot of these point-and-click games sometimes.
[110:28.37]And this is in total brute force strategy.
[110:30.25]I knew what I was doing up until this point.
[110:38.81]This is nothing.
[110:39.83]I remember the days of playing, like, original Monkey Island.
[110:44.55]Or that Toon, uh, Toonstruck.
[110:48.21]And those were so obscure.
[110:49.97]Some of those things, you had to combine, like, three items and shit.
[110:52.55]Those games were ridiculous.
[111:02.92]Okay, eat.
[111:03.66]Uh, I kinda have to move out of the way.
[111:15.41]Some of those games... There's no way.
[111:19.57]Maybe a guess, if you could.
[111:21.95]But that's kind of a game where you have to have a wiki.
[111:24.33]Two and struck is like impossible without the wiki.
[111:26.71]Now what?
[111:26.91]Now make him throw up?
[111:44.54]Did you get it?
[111:49.98]So hang on!
[111:53.96]Do it again!
[111:59.55]So what happens if I- hold on, can I pull him out?
[112:03.11]Is this gonna be Jerma Rumble live action?
[112:12.98]Wow.
[112:13.12]See you later.
[112:13.90]Alright, so we only have the blue Max left to take care of.

[113:18.37]I don't have a hundred trillion dollars.
[113:19.57]But Bosco, aren't you feeling generous?
[113:21.94]Yes, but I need the money for my poor, sick mother.

[116:16.12]You guys cheated.
[116:16.54]Oh.

[116:16.70]Yeah, that was really messed up.

[117:35.73]Steal the China.
[117:37.25]Alright, let's go... Here, look!
[117:39.71]No.
[117:40.67]No.
[117:44.05]Max and I made Sybil throw up once before, and that's something I never want to see again.
[117:51.87]You look like you're in a shopping mood.
[117:54.08]Might you be interested in, say, the United States?
[117:56.74]100?
[117:56.78]What's the national debt?
[117:58.34]How much is it?
[117:58.82]We can call it Lower Saskatchewan.
[118:01.66]What a perfectly delightful name.
[118:04.22]Kid, for the tune of 100 trillion.
[118:07.10]Oh, such a grand country deserves a grand price.
[118:11.64]We simply refuse to buy it for less than 100 trillion dollars.
[118:15.98]It's only fair.
[118:17.84]We wouldn't hear of it.
[118:19.46]That's far too much.
[118:20.80]I'll handle this, Mr. President.
[118:22.69]If you insist, Your Highness.
[118:24.49]Is cash alright?
[118:26.07]We've been dying to use the new Canadian trillion dollar notes.
[118:29.89]Is that a picture of Celine Dion?
[118:32.02]She's a national treasure!
[118:33.36]Trillion dollar note.
[118:34.36]Just did that in front of Abe Lincoln.
[118:41.00]Alright, let's go get it.
[118:53.97]I got paid in Canadian.
[119:04.40]Earthquake.
[119:06.98]Then Earthquake.
[119:07.92]And I'm good to go.
[119:16.93]Alright.
[119:17.89]Let's have it!
[119:23.01]We want to buy something.
[119:23.67]We want to buy something.
[119:24.51]We want to buy the Earthquake Maker.
[119:28.18]Here you go, Bosco.
[119:29.62]100 trillion in completely non-counterfeit bills.
[119:32.99]Let me look at that.
[119:36.58]Okay, looks good to me.
[119:38.70]Here's your earthquake maker.
[119:41.22]Remote control?
[119:42.56]Don't get me wrong, I love TV as much as the next guy, but... It controls my satellite defense system.
[119:48.97]Only one button to work through.
[119:50.87]Just press it for an earthquake.
[119:53.03]And this adheres, I hope, to all reasonable safety guidelines?
[119:57.45]Who knows?
[119:59.03]One more thing.
[119:59.87]You have to be in range of the satellite for it to work.
[120:03.23]It's on the moon.
[120:04.05]Alright.
[120:23.50]This prismatology nonsense really gets my blood boiling.
[120:27.10]That's from the heat generated by the limitless energy of your imagination.
[120:31.56]What, what, okay.
[120:32.24]My limitless imagination is going to cause an aneurysm if you don't stop talking like that, Max.
[120:36.39]What color of the rainbow would I be, would you say?
[120:38.83]What do you guys think?
[120:45.19]Never mind.
[120:49.79]Like, by personality and everything about me, what would it be?
[120:56.66]Piss brown.
[120:58.01]That's not... That's not a color of a rainbow.
[121:06.57]Piss brown, oh my god.
[121:09.63]I know what that looks like.
[121:11.79]You ever have like a dark brown piss and you just go, holy shit man, I gotta drink some water.
[121:21.03]It's happened like maybe twice in my whole life.
[121:33.53]Alright, so we're gonna earthquake him.
[121:43.23]Earthquake maker remote.
[121:45.07]Let's put the quake under here.
[121:46.71]This isn't... No, I don't have brown pee, guys.
[121:48.43]Don't worry.
[121:48.71]Well...
[122:01.83]Cut the tail.
[122:02.45]Cut the tail.
[122:03.69]Cut tail.
[122:05.55]Come on.
[122:06.11]Is the streamer listening to me?
[122:07.09]Cut tail.
[122:09.11]Why is he not listening to me?
[122:10.08]Cut the tail.
[122:10.60]He's not doing it.
[122:11.04]He's not doing it.
[122:11.54]Whatever.
[122:11.86]You may not want to watch this.
[122:21.44]Nice.
[122:22.50]Hikagi, cut tail.
[122:24.26]Good job.
[122:25.10]Gee, all of a sudden, I feel like watching TV and eating orange marshmallow peanuts instead of doing anything constructive.
[122:30.18]I was so invested and involved in an item that he's not going to use, that no one uses.
[122:33.52]It's so strange.
[122:34.70]Cut it.
[122:35.02]Have I been away, Sam?
[122:36.71]In a manner of speaking, Hugh Bliss split you into pieces, so you've kind of been all over the place.
[122:42.13]Hugh Bliss.
[122:43.33]I hate that guy now with his phony smile and his artificial happy happy.
[122:47.99]What do you say we tar and feather that self-righteous jerk?
[122:51.26]You did end up using the melted ice cream axe for a large portion of the game.
[122:53.36]Yeah, I know.
[122:53.62]That's true.
[123:18.46]But I did complain about it a lot.
[123:20.83]I got really mad at it, remember?
[123:22.39]Alright, so.
[123:26.03]Let's go back and talk to Mr. Bliss.
[123:36.80]Work this item!
[123:43.05]What is this?
[123:43.47]What's this drop hole here?
[123:47.17]What color is Jeremy?
[123:48.27]Green.
[123:49.01]Yep.
[123:49.35]Alright, vote it.
[123:50.07]Green, yellow, red, blue, indigo, violet, orange.
[123:55.41]Green.
[123:55.87]Alright.
[123:56.33]No, green is... I'm alright with green.
[123:57.91]I'm winning by a lot.
[124:04.56]Yeah, no.
[124:05.14]Brown's not on there.
[124:06.56]I can see myself as a green.
[124:11.93]Hold on.
[124:12.99]Wait.
[124:23.70]Color personality test.
[124:25.61]Let's see if you guys are right.
[124:33.07]Taking the color personality type test.
[124:35.65]Personality color equals personality type.
[124:41.91]Okay, hold on.
[124:42.51]I'm going to take this on stream right now.
[124:49.31]Damn, it's like 95 right now?
[124:51.37]No, it's not.
[124:52.73]Is it that hot in Vegas right now?
[124:54.53]No.
[124:54.89]What?
[124:56.24]That was wrong.
[124:56.74]OK.
[125:03.34]Let me open this up on stream and hold on.
[125:07.85]Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
[125:20.05]Color personality test, start the test.
[125:21.88]Okay, let me just capture it.
[125:30.72]Watch this be like, there are a lot of questions on this test.
[125:39.71]This is going to take like a fucking at least 20 minutes.
[125:50.19]Why is everybody resident sleepering this?
[125:52.37]You don't want to see this?
[125:56.45]Nobody wants, you don't want to see this?
[126:06.17]There's a lot of ResidentSleepers.

[127:24.66]You should see it.
[127:26.50]Alright, so here we go.
[127:38.11]There are so many ads on this site.
[127:40.58]It's kind of awful.

[128:13.76]Let us vote.
[128:14.66]No, this is what I think of myself.
[128:16.60]You guys just told me what color you thought I was.
[128:22.88]A good creative worker.
[128:26.69]Okay.
[128:27.87]Next question.
[128:30.59]When you're given a briefing paper, what do you do with it?
[128:33.61]What do you mean a briefing paper?
[128:36.39]Send it back?
[128:37.39]I issue briefing papers.
[128:38.65]I don't read them.
[128:43.50]Skim it for the... What?
[128:45.66]Skim it and pretend I read it.
[128:47.74]Read it carefully and act on it.
[128:49.10]Rewrite it and send it back.
[128:50.84]I would skim it and I would pretend I read it.
[128:56.49]I'd be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I read the whole thing.
[128:58.51]I would make sure I pulled out one or two sentences.
[129:03.91]Okay, yeah, I would skim it.
[129:06.97]Imagine you had to put some furniture together.
[129:09.15]How would you go about it?
[129:11.50]Grab all the pieces and figure it out without instructions.
[129:15.20]Follow the instructions to the letter.
[129:16.78]Get somebody else to do it and supervise them.
[129:19.20]I wouldn't.
[129:19.76]I'd be building my own furniture.
[129:26.01]No, I wouldn't do that.
[129:29.01]I absolutely would not just do that.
[129:31.33]Do I want to not have a chair done correctly?
[129:39.03]You literally did this test yesterday?
[129:41.87]That's weird.
[129:42.41]Labo is, yeah, I would follow the instructions.
[129:44.31]I would.
[129:46.09]You're asked to provide an assessment of a colleague.
[129:47.98]How would you approach it?
[129:50.38]Discuss it with them and tell them what you're doing, what you're going to say.
[129:54.08]Discuss it with them.
[129:54.78]See what they want said about themselves.
[129:58.86]Give it to them and ask them to fill it out honestly.
[130:03.09]Just fill it out honestly.
[130:04.15]Definitely not this one.
[130:11.46]If you're asked to provide it, I would ask him to fill it out honestly.

[130:49.04]If you can't find a solution to a problem, would it most likely be because somebody else must have let you down?
[130:53.73]You haven't shown enough imagination.
[130:55.13]You haven't worked on it long enough.
[130:56.43]You haven't looked at it from enough angles.
[130:59.15]Well, I look at it too much.
[131:00.47]I look into that.
[131:01.27]I look into stuff way too many times.
[131:02.89]So that's definitely what it is.
[131:05.41]I just hadn't looked at it yet from like a million different angles.
[131:09.67]Which of these things do you value most about employment?
[131:13.38]Stimulation.
[131:15.81]If you overheard a colleague talking about you, which of these statements would upset you the most?
[131:22.96]They are so conventional.
[131:24.32]They are not fit to lead.
[131:25.46]Their ideas aren't very creative.
[131:26.70]They are not a team player.
[131:35.75]If a colleague is... Why is this all about colleagues and shit?
[131:38.75]Isn't this supposed to be my personality, not other people's personalities?
[131:44.03]If a colleague is upset, how would you deal with it?
[131:46.69]Tell them to pull themselves together.
[131:48.19]Try to find a solution.
[131:49.33]Think of something to take their mind off it.
[131:51.01]Offer them a shoulder.
[131:55.20]If you need ideas from your team for a new project, how would you garner them?

[132:03.24]Circulate an email.
[132:06.94]Put out your own suggestions and ask for comments demanding a paper from each member.
[132:14.23]That would be that one.
[132:17.35]If a new system is implemented in your office, which of these is most likely to be your reaction?

[132:25.29]Resistance.

[132:40.45]I don't like to run at all.
[132:41.35]Where's I don't run?
[132:49.47]Whereas I watch people running from the stands.
[132:54.32]Free running, because then I can stop whenever I want to.
[132:57.72]If somebody at work has made you angry, how do you react?
[132:59.98]Try and analyze what has made you angry and the reason why.
[133:02.30]Have a reasonable discussion.
[133:05.54]Attack them at every opportunity or keep it to yourself and let off steam outside.
[133:12.70]It is absolutely not free.
[133:19.94]I would probably keep it to myself and just... I'd keep it to myself and then like go outside and like scream at the moon.
[133:27.76]From what you know of these countries, cultures, etc., where do you think you would fit in best?
[133:38.39]Germany, France, China, Brazil.

[134:18.06]Single-seater sports.
[134:19.48]Wait, one seat?
[134:20.40]Is it a go-kart?
[134:26.09]Probably that one.
[134:30.53]Which of these would you be most satisfied with at the end of a project you were leading?
[134:34.91]That it surpassed expectations, I got the job done, that everyone did as I said.
[134:39.34]That it surpassed expectations.
[134:42.96]On a plane, do you think you would be the best as a co-pilot, navigator, flight engineer, or chief pilot?
[134:49.66]Hmm, too much.
[134:51.10]Too much to do.
[134:53.18]Probably co-pilot.
[134:54.14]Because you have just enough responsibility, but you're not like the... I'd be the co-pilot.
[135:02.01]There's an important deadline coming up and it looks like your team might not make it.
[135:05.19]What will you do?
[135:07.77]Ask whether the deadline was never realistic and if it should be altered.
[135:11.01]Drive the team onwards to work harder and harder.
[135:14.28]See if there were any corners which can be cut.
[135:17.30]Just keep going.
[135:18.02]You can only do your best.
[135:19.12]Yep.
[135:21.47]I want like a reveal here, hold on.
[135:24.25]If you were climbing up a mountain and a member of your team couldn't go on, what would you do?
[135:30.31]Split the team up, some to go down, some to carry on.
[135:34.01]Leave them with the team and carry on on your own.
[135:38.21]Turn the whole team around, but carry on with the rest, you'll get them on the way back.
[135:49.44]I don't know if I would do that.
[135:52.03]would probably split up the team some go you know I I kind of want to stay up and I want to go up the mountain yeah I would split the team up he's going to be dead when you come back yeah in a conversation what are you aiming for a solution inspiration a consensus agreement inspiration what is your attitude to workplace friendships

[136:24.07]Last one.
[136:26.49]Which of these things make you the happiest?
[136:27.83]A life in which others look up to me.

[136:32.65]A quiet, contented life.
[136:34.23]A happy, exciting life.
[136:35.46]Are you ready?
[136:35.86]Here you go.
[136:36.28]Let's see.
[136:36.84]Green.
[136:38.20]Green.
[136:40.36]No!
[136:42.08]No, that's cool.
[136:51.46]It's P. Brown.
[136:53.66]It's not P. Brown, okay?
[136:57.98]Creator, performer.
[136:59.34]You like to constantly challenge where you... Is that supposed to be me?
[137:04.51]You aren't prepared to accept the status quo without seeing as things can be done differently.
[137:09.49]You think very deeply about issues and you always like to bring a new way of looking at things to the table.
[137:13.83]You're very enthusiastic and will be popular with colleagues.
[137:16.93]You must make sure that you follow through on your creativity with concrete results.
[137:22.82]Nice.
[137:23.12]Okay, there you go.
[137:24.26]I did it.
[137:28.32]How do I get the last 30 minutes of the stream back, streamer?
[137:42.72]They stream sniped me.
[137:44.06]Alright, we're going back up to the earthquake weapon.
[137:54.81]Could have done it at the end of the stream.

[138:08.80]You little idiot.
[138:10.96]You ruined my hypno-bean.
[138:13.04]I should have killed you earlier, but what can I say?
[138:15.60]I'm too nice.
[138:17.44]That said, die, buddy!
[138:20.24]Wrong.
[138:24.47]What the?
[138:25.45]What the?
[138:26.33]Hi, we're Hugh Bliss!
[138:30.09]We are a space-faring colony of sentient bacteria.
[138:35.96]A sentence I really did not expect to hear today.
[138:39.50]We cannot be harmed by bullets.
[138:41.66]We only need one thing.
[138:43.55]To feed.
[138:45.39]You see?
[138:46.77]We feed on the endorphins produced by humans experiencing true bliss.
[138:52.12]So, you don't care if people are happy at all.
[138:55.20]You just want to eat till you drop.
[138:57.56]Yes.
[138:58.00]Hey, I hear that.
[139:00.06]But you want us to starve.
[139:02.43]And for that, you will die.
[139:04.27]In the most fantastic display of the universe!
[139:08.49]And the richest!
[139:10.80]Hey, gotta look good for the cameras.
[139:12.66]What cameras?
[139:13.74]Pack your bags, Sam, because you just won an all-expense-paid trip to your grave!
[139:20.04]So who killed him?
[139:20.74]And you get to watch him die.
[139:23.98]Let the magic begin.
[139:28.98]Ladies and gentlemen, for my first trick, I give you the Rainbow Wheel of Death!
[139:37.39]Yay!
[139:37.79]Oh, Dad!
[139:42.37]That's a rainbow wheel.
[139:43.59]Not yet.
[139:43.89]Not yet.
[139:44.13]I'm still alive.
[139:45.95]Oh, well.

[140:22.02]Earthquake.
[140:22.44]No.
[140:22.50]Um...

[140:38.72]I think it only works on things with stomachs.
[140:42.83]And... Break.
[140:45.67]Magic range.
[140:49.17]Magic jump.
[140:54.11]Just bend them all?
[140:54.95]Yeah.
[141:10.34]What?
[141:10.56]So now he's stuck there.
[141:11.36]It was that easy apparently.
[141:12.66]That's what I'm saying.
[141:14.24]Oh yeah.
[141:14.52]Oh.

[142:45.62]It's the Ticket to Oblivion.
[142:51.15]Enjoy your stay in outer space.
[142:53.59]Until you die!
[142:57.62]I think I know what to do here.
[142:59.82]Lock the door and then switch.
[143:02.14]Or not.
[143:02.84]Okay, so we are now... Lock the door.
[143:28.89]What do you mean, you can't do that now?
[143:30.65]I don't know.
[143:33.05]I mean, I could switch with him, but it was just something like a stupid earthquake?
[143:43.26]Lock the door from the inside, and then he won't be able to unlock it from the inside.
[143:48.45]Right.
[143:49.35]You know, that's a good point, but I'm just trying to think of things.
[143:51.93]It's a cartoon!
[143:53.43]I don't know.
[144:00.00]This is fun.
[144:02.66]It's okay, everyone!
[144:04.14]I'm alright!
[144:05.74]Boo!
[144:05.82]You suck!
[144:09.31]I heard that.
[144:12.37]Consider this.
[144:13.27]A trap so deadly it would cause you to die.
[144:16.19]That is deadly.
[144:17.59]It's the cleansing bath of annihilation!
[144:21.62]Oh, could we skip this one?
[144:24.44]I kind of have a thing about drowning.
[144:28.59]So do I just keep switching with him?
[144:30.13]Oh, shit, it's a dump tank.
[144:31.41]Thanks, little buddy.
[144:31.91]Well, uh, water tank.
[144:32.61]I don't think... I think I just... Is it just as simple as one, two, three?
[144:35.45]I'm gonna have to anti-bacteria something.
[144:59.65]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

[145:07.75]Oh no, we have to do this again.
[145:11.57]Magic jump.
[145:11.89]Magic salt box.
[145:30.34]So, it seems like... He's going to keep going around.
[145:45.71]I can't go anywhere but here.
[145:47.13]Maybe I can... Hold on.
[145:48.25]Attack the dog!
[146:00.71]What if I switch back?
[146:01.49]I can't do that now.
[146:04.51]Evil giggle.
[146:06.92]I can actually... We're going to separate your bliss!
[146:15.68]Just let him do it.
[146:19.80]Having my bliss separated is not what the brochure's made of.
[146:22.32]I need to, like... I don't get... Evil giggle.
[146:26.05]Evil giggle.
[146:29.72]I have to go pick up stuff.

[146:33.46]I'm just gonna do it.
[146:35.40]I definitely have to, like, anti-bacteria.
[147:07.27]Okay.
[147:10.12]Anti-bacteria.
[147:16.04]Here it comes again.
[147:17.04]What's that on the table?
[147:21.35]Alright, so hold on.
[147:26.49]Magic junk.
[147:28.69]Microphone.
[147:30.51]Crystals.
[147:31.97]How do I get over there?
[147:39.77]Okay, now magic crystals.
[147:50.31]No, I can't move.
[147:51.87]I have to bend shit then.
[147:54.39]I have to... Is there anything I can bend from here?
[148:00.66]Like this magic junk there?
[148:06.09]He's impervious to gastrokinesis.
[148:09.00]I can't make him throw up.
[148:16.58]Bend the bent spoon.
[148:17.94]Oh no!
[148:18.26]Mommy!
[148:19.06]I wanna get off!
[148:21.08]Where's the magic junk?
[148:24.14]Nope, not spoony enough.
[148:27.08]Evil Chortle!
[148:27.82]I mean, I can bend these, but it doesn't really do much for me.
[148:49.04]Another spoon, another spoon, spoon, spoon!
[148:53.22]Shoot him, isn't it?
[148:54.38]I can't kill him!
[148:59.88]Magic rings?
[149:00.84]Can I, like, do anything with this?
[149:02.84]Nope, I'm not spooning him.
[149:06.44]You can't kill bacteria.
[149:08.42]That's true.
[149:15.51]Okay.
[149:19.95]Match the items with the spoons.
[149:21.23]That's what I was thinking, too.
[149:21.95]Maybe just put them back up there, but... I think it only works on things with stomachs.
[149:25.78]You can't put them up there.
[149:27.82]You have to shoot each individual bacteria.
[149:38.76]anything else over here annoying oh no not one of those 3D images if god had wanted pictures to be 3D he wouldn't have made them 2D can I bend it earthquake alright I'm just gonna walk next up oblivion

[150:54.89]There's the crystals.
[150:55.99]There's the water tank.
[150:57.89]What if I break the tank?
[150:58.87]And I shoot the tank and have it explode?
[151:10.00]I don't think this is gonna work.
[151:19.69]You have to dissolve him.
[151:20.83]That's not gonna work!
[151:27.22]Alright.
[151:29.34]Keep going!
[151:30.10]Soft!
[151:34.50]Alright!
[151:35.78]Switch!
[151:40.58]Put bleach in the tank.
[151:43.78]I didn't think I could move.
[151:45.12]I didn't think I could move.
[151:46.24]Why is he letting me do this?
[151:49.39]He freezes me every other time.
[151:52.49]What are you doing?
[151:53.67]Just seeing what this saw can do.
[151:55.71]You dirty mutt.
[151:57.07]I'm going to shove that saw up your... Come on.
[151:59.77]This is a family show.
[152:01.71]I wouldn't swear.
[152:03.23]I'll just kill him some other way.
[152:07.83]Wait, so I have to stop each one of these from being able to do... Okay, I get it.
[152:11.87]So... So what's the deal here, then?
[152:18.84]Okay, um... Key?
[152:23.40]No, no, no.
[152:29.74]I need to make it so this is not functional.
[152:35.28]I can't do that in this predicament.
[152:37.28]Why not?
[152:42.58]I'm stuck.
[152:46.44]No, I tried to shoot the log.
[152:47.66]The log didn't work.
[152:49.90]I can't pull the gun out.
[152:50.86]Wait.
[152:51.76]Can I do this?
[153:06.95]The door's just open.
[153:08.37]Separate this.
[153:11.63]Oh, I'm boiling in the life.
[153:20.53]Come on down, Max.
[153:21.69]You just won the grand prize.
[153:23.45]A drink of our villain.
[153:26.26]Hey, Hugh Bliss!
[153:27.54]See you on the other side!
[153:30.20]Well, I can't wait to see the souvenir you came with in this case.
[153:33.56]And with my next number one, I shall give birth to the cult of diuretics!
[153:40.17]Which reminds me, we've got to go knock out Whizzer again.
[153:43.23]And everyone else on Earth, for that matter.
[153:44.97]Oh, yeah!
[153:46.09]Hey, have you seen my boxing glove?
[153:48.15]I can't find it anywhere.
[153:50.03]That's it?
[153:51.78]I was saving it for a surprise.
[153:53.92]You're the best friend I ever had, Sam.
[153:56.64]And you're mine, little buddy.
[153:58.68]Now, let's go save the world.
[154:01.73]Is that season one complete?
[154:06.55]I think that's it for season one.
[154:10.27]Is there a secret at the end?
[154:12.35]Hey, season one.
[154:20.49]Is there a post credit scene?
[154:21.45]Why would you do that?
[154:43.34]Right side of the moon That was cool
[154:55.57]Oh, you're unhypnotizing everybody, I see.
[154:57.59]That's fun.
[154:59.10]It's fun to just play these games.
[155:04.74]Just kinda... I love the hangout.
[155:07.48]Just chill.
[155:23.57]and play Sam & Max.
[155:26.31]I would do something like The Walking Dead, but I already did them all.
[155:30.63]When are we gonna get another case, Sam?
[155:32.69]Surely the local lawbreakers must miss our esoteric brand of personalized criminal justice.
[155:37.05]Have you played Puzzle Agent?
[155:41.59]I have.
[155:41.95]You're probably wondering, well, if you like this, why play all these other ones?
[155:47.94]I've probably played them all.
[155:51.08]Wolf Among Us, I've already done it.
[155:53.08]What's going on on the screen?
[156:01.43]And those experiences, you kind of experience it and then you don't again.
[156:07.59]So if I were to play Season 1 or Season 2 of The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us, I already know the story and I know what happens.
[156:16.62]Wouldn't really want to play them again on stream.
[156:18.21]You played all the post Walking Dead stuff?
[156:21.89]Yeah.
[156:32.85]No, I did not do Minecraft story mode, and I don't... I'm not going to do Minecraft story mode.
[156:38.13]It's not gonna happen.
[156:39.13]No.
[156:39.23]You signed yourself up now.
[156:42.45]No, I did not.
[156:44.89]I just told you no.
[157:04.42]I'm an ongoing project, like a golden calf or a graven image.
[157:07.61]I'll only rest once people are sacrificing their firstborn unto me.
[157:11.45]Also, I'd like to direct.
[157:12.81]I play Grim Fandango, yes I have.
[157:19.38]Play season two, you mean right now?
[157:36.17]Maybe.
[157:39.73]We have a couple options.
[157:41.21]I'm gonna take a piss.
[157:42.33]We'll come back and we'll assess our options.
[157:45.93]Because there are a couple things to do.
[157:47.25]But I do want to see this ending credits sequence.
[157:52.35]Because it is very, very fun.
[158:03.36]Play episode 1 of Minecraft Story Mode.
[158:05.60]I'm not doing that.
[158:10.04]I'm gonna have to be an 8 or a 9 out of 10 shit-faced for you guys to convince me on that stream to play Minecraft Story Mode episode 1.
[158:18.66]2007, wow.
[158:19.38]That was a long time ago.
[158:38.49]That website is down.
[158:39.49]I would assume it is.
[158:40.22]Oh, there you go.
[158:41.68]That's season one complete.
[158:43.66]It was cool.
[158:44.00]It was fun.
[158:46.80]I'm going to go pee.
[158:48.16]I'll be right back.
[158:49.56]And we will figure out what we're going to do for the remainder of the stream.
[158:53.45]See you guys in like two minutes.
[158:54.73]Three minutes.
[158:55.67]Something like that.
[158:57.49]Be right back.
