[00:03.64]What the... Hello?
[00:11.15]What the... What's going... What's going on?
[00:22.17]Hello, Rumble.
[00:24.79]Welcome to the game.
[00:27.05]Seems like you're in quite a precarious position here.
[00:31.20]Where am I?
[00:32.42]Where you are doesn't really matter.
[00:34.36]It's what is happening right now that does matter.
[00:37.70]You find yourself strapped to a chair, don't you?
[00:40.60]Yeah, yeah.
[00:41.52]I can't... Can you get out?
[00:44.18]No, I can't.
[00:44.76]I can't get out.
[00:46.80]The amount of chains on there would hold every single bicycle for a million years.
[00:52.88]For a million... It's a very long time, Ranboo.
[00:56.66]Don't even struggle.
[00:57.62]It's not even worth it.
[00:59.90]What you do need to know is there is a bucket below you, isn't there?
[01:04.02]Yeah.
[01:05.68]Can you see the bucket?
[01:07.42]I can see it.
[01:09.30]In one hour, 65 million volts are going to go through your brain.
[01:17.56]Through your brain.
[01:19.90]Killing you instantly.
[01:22.56]If you can find the key to open up that chain around your body, you'll get out.
[01:29.94]And just to make sure you know it's not fake, why don't we give you a little bit of juice and see how you feel about this?
[01:35.93]No, no, no, no!
[01:44.56]Just a little juice to test and see how you can handle it.
[01:51.68]Just a little bit of juice.
[01:56.53]Oh, shit.
[02:01.31]Rambo?
[02:02.55]Rambo, you alright?
[02:04.97]Oh, fuck.
[02:05.51]I thought I killed him.
[02:07.03]That would have been awful, considering there's a lot more going on today.
[02:10.76]Sorry about that.
[02:11.82]I honestly didn't mean to do that much.
[02:13.38]I thought I only did 10.
[02:14.18]I think I did 10,000.
[02:14.70]Let me just make sure that was correct.
[02:17.30]It looks correct to me.
[02:19.88]You have one hour, Ranboo.
[02:21.98]And maybe there'll be some help along the way.
[02:24.14]We'll see.
[02:24.68]You're sick!
[02:27.79]Or you die.
[02:29.77]Why?
[02:31.69]You're sick!
[02:33.83]We're all a little sick, aren't we, Ranboo?
[02:37.77]Good luck.
[02:40.44]You'll never find the right key, considering there has to be at least a thousand in there.
[02:46.48]I call this one the janitor, by the way.
[02:49.68]This room does seem to make a lot of noise, which is what I like.
[02:53.33]Are you okay, by the way?
[02:54.41]I just want to make sure you're still fine.
[02:55.93]I mean, I feel a little fried.
[02:57.75]I think I'm a little foggy, but I think I'm okay.
[03:00.07]I'll get you some water, baby.
[03:01.27]I'll try this one.
[03:03.95]You made your decision.
[03:07.02]A little key, it seems.
[03:11.80]Oh, my God, it worked.
[03:13.10]It worked.
[03:13.68]What?
[03:14.68]Oh, my God.
[03:18.46]That's impossible!
[03:27.68]There's a one in 10,000 chance that that could have actually happened, and it did?
[03:33.45]Oh my God, I just might, I should just shock you again.
[03:35.77]No, please, please, please.
[03:37.13]I should shock you again.
[03:39.45]Why did I do that earlier?
[03:42.86]I can't, alright, then you're fine, okay.
[03:46.50]I thought that was going to take you at least 45 minutes, maybe an hour.
[03:49.46]I honestly think you could have died in this room.
[03:52.20]Yes, I'm just lucky.
[03:54.25]Well, I don't believe in luck.
[03:56.77]I believe in fate.
[03:59.85]That's stupid.
[04:02.59]It is a little stupid.
[04:03.53]It is a little dumb.
[04:04.21]I had my palm read and that's what they told me.
[04:06.81]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[04:08.08]Be careful, be careful.
[04:09.04]You're going to last at least another few hours.
[04:10.70]Alright.
[04:11.71]A few hours.
[04:12.91]At least.
[04:13.91]How long is this game?
[04:16.39]Well, that's for you to know and for me to find out.
[04:19.85]What, you don't know?
[04:20.41]Well, the other way around, yeah.
[04:22.77]Oh, okay.
[04:25.93]Is the picture okay on the television by the way around?
[04:28.71]I mean, it's, well, it's a little foggy, but I guess I can- You can see me?
[04:32.69]Make out some, is that a mask?
[04:40.16]Oh, my rats will take care of you if you need any help.
[04:43.46]Rats?
[04:44.16]Yes.
[04:44.80]They could probably go in there now and give you a little bit of an introduction.
[04:51.90]This is one of my rats here right now.
[04:54.32]What are they doing?
[04:55.04]Are they just... Well, I mean, I'm recording everything, just, you know, for me.
[05:00.26]Okay, well, can I just... I'm just going to turn this off, honestly.
[05:03.05]I don't... Don't turn me off.
[05:05.69]I don't want to go yet.
[05:06.51]I'll just... Yeah.
[05:07.21]There he goes.
[05:21.50]What am I supposed to do in here?
[05:25.73]Hello again.
[05:30.11]You don't think I control all the TVs in this facility, Radford?
[05:34.23]Yeah.
[05:36.08]Very foolish of you to think that.
[05:39.96]What is this place?
[05:40.98]I mean, where, who's that?
[05:42.96]I mean, where am I?
[05:44.38]You're in the surgery room.
[05:46.26]Surgery?
[05:47.48]You're going to be performing a surgery.
[05:51.00]I don't think I can.
[05:52.96]The person lying on the table right now has a key in them.
[05:59.93]You need to find that key in one hour again.
[06:03.39]Theme going on here.
[06:04.71]Okay.
[06:06.53]Good luck.
[06:07.79]I'm not going to give you any more hints.
[06:09.30]It's up to you to figure it out.
[06:11.94]Oh, my God.
[06:13.77]Understand.
[06:15.54]I understand what I have to do.
[06:16.68]Turn me off!
[06:18.86]Turn, I can, I can, oh.
[06:24.18]I really don't want to do this.
[06:25.36]Hey, it's me again.
[06:29.12]Whoa.
[06:30.32]Just saying hello.
[06:31.36]Oh my God.
[06:34.23]How are you?
[06:35.05]I'm doing alright, man.
[06:35.95]I mean, I don't want to, I really don't want to do this.
[06:38.37]Do what?
[06:39.42]I don't want to have to get the key.
[06:42.36]It's too much.
[06:44.46]Well, you should make that choice on your own.
[06:46.84]You want to die in here, Ranboo?
[06:48.65]Would you like to die in this room?
[06:50.09]I don't want to die in this room.
[06:52.07]Then you need to find the key that is in this person.
[06:56.03]Okay, okay, I get it.
[06:57.33]I understand.
[06:58.13]This club is tough.
[07:02.46]I just get to watch.
[07:03.30]This is great for me.
[07:04.36]Okay, okay.
[07:08.17]You want it back?
[07:08.89]Yeah, put it back in.
[07:09.99]Come on.
[07:10.27]Put it back in, okay.
[07:11.23]Hey, hey, hey.
[07:12.03]Hello, hello.
[07:12.93]What the fuck is that?
[07:13.71]Why did you make me do this?
[07:15.10]Oh, dude.
[07:16.02]What the fuck are you doing?
[07:17.04]Are you a doctor, man?
[07:18.30]What's going on?
[07:18.84]You said the key was in him, so there's no key in here.
[07:22.10]The key was in him?
[07:24.51]Yeah, that's what you said.
[07:25.45]You lamented it.
[07:26.95]You even came back to say it again.
[07:29.17]I told you the key was on him.
[07:31.65]The key was on him.
[07:32.95]You didn't say on.
[07:34.27]You said in.
[07:35.24]No, I did not.
[07:36.52]I said on.
[07:37.92]On.
[07:38.10]I was out cold.
[07:40.92]I have no stake in this, dudes.
[07:42.30]Alright, you can take this elsewhere.
[07:44.10]Did I really say in?
[07:45.38]You said in.
[07:46.69]Why else would I just be tearing into a guy?
[07:49.17]I don't know.
[07:50.47]Why would you?
[07:51.07]I wouldn't do that either.
[07:52.05]That's just fucking twisted.
[07:53.27]You have a little bomb strapped to me.
[07:55.27]Of course I'm going to tear into someone.
[07:57.79]You think I'm going to have you open somebody up and try to go through their body?
[08:01.54]You can't get up to a chair nearly now, man.
[08:03.82]That's disgusting.
[08:04.84]No, it's on, on.
[08:06.28]I definitely didn't say that.
[08:07.70]You'd have to figure that out on your own.
[08:09.90]You should have seen me earlier, man.
[08:11.24]It was crazy, the fucking spurts I got on that thing.
[08:14.14]I went to go to the bathroom, and I sat down, and he's ripping into you.
[08:17.09]Is anyone certified for this?
[08:18.43]Because I'm looking to get pieced back together, hopefully.
[08:22.85]I don't think that's going to happen.
[08:24.49]I don't know if my insurance is not going to cover this, dude.
[08:28.69]Well, I definitely don't have insurance.
[08:30.67]Are you really that upset about going into the toilet?
[08:32.81]You just tore into his entire body.
[08:35.64]Fuck this guy.
[08:36.28]I'll go to the toilet, dude.
[08:37.62]Let me in.
[08:38.50]I'll go elbow deep.
[08:39.78]You're not in a position to get up.
[08:41.42]Let Ranboo do it.
[08:42.28]It's his test.
[08:43.40]Could you at least kind of seal me back up vaguely?
[08:46.99]No, just leave him there.
[08:48.19]Leave him be.
[08:48.71]Don't listen to this guy.
[08:49.97]He's not a doctor.
[08:51.01]One of my rats will take care of it.
[08:53.48]Oh shit, a rat, dude.
[08:54.70]I fucking love rats.
[08:55.68]Before you go, bring it in, dude.
[08:57.88]Bring it in.
[08:58.70]Dab me up, man.
[09:00.18]Good luck out there, dude.
[09:01.38]Thanks, man.
[09:01.82]Oh my God, you're so wet.
[09:04.86]Alright.
[09:05.48]You're sick.
[09:06.94]Later, hater.
[09:07.82]You're the sick one.
[09:08.90]You ripped into somebody.
[09:10.70]You tore into somebody.
[09:12.02]You told me to.
[09:12.86]You should really double check your... Oh, he's gone.
[09:16.50]What you see before you is a group of people on a carousel.
[09:21.25]What?
[09:22.27]What was that?
[09:23.65]They're all in a very bad, bad way.
[09:26.54]I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
[09:28.04]I think your TV is like broken or something.
[09:30.34]It's like a muffle.
[09:32.83]What are you talking about?
[09:33.77]Hello?
[09:34.03]I think the TV in here is broken.
[09:35.67]One of these guys must have thrown something at it.
[09:37.87]I don't know.
[09:38.95]There's something wrong with the television in the room?
[09:40.82]Yeah, there's something wrong with it.
[09:42.60]I can't see, can't barely hear it.
[09:44.70]Just hold on a minute.
[09:45.64]Don't worry.
[09:46.00]Stay right there.
[09:46.52]Don't move.
[09:46.94]Nobody move!
[09:47.64]Nobody move!
[09:48.34]We can't.
[09:49.56]Rats!
[09:49.88]We're tied up.
[09:50.56]Come with me for just a second.
[09:53.30]This one here.
[09:54.94]I haven't used this in a long time.
[09:58.26]Let's move.
[10:04.59]Easy, easy.
[10:05.27]Be careful.
[10:05.79]I can't really see.
[10:08.87]Very obviously.
[10:09.69]Okay.
[10:13.07]Put a tape in.
[10:21.16]Ow!
[10:21.28]Shit, that hit me right in the face.
[10:27.42]Hello.
[10:29.18]Everybody, how are you?
[10:31.27]It's just peachy.
[10:35.79]Did you not make it high?
[10:37.81]Did you make it too high or what?
[10:40.88]You know this guy?
[10:42.74]I don't know.
[10:43.24]He just forced me to look.
[10:45.94]Just forced me to tear into someone.
[10:47.70]I don't even know.
[10:49.76]Oh my God.
[10:51.24]Hello there.
[11:01.23]What you see before you is a group of people on a carousel.
[11:05.20]Yeah.
[11:05.74]Each one of them has a, what?
[11:08.52]I see, I see the people on the carousel.
[11:11.34]Yes, you can.
[11:12.20]I can.
[11:12.66]Can you not hear me?
[11:13.84]I mean, am I coming through, or?
[11:15.50]I can hear you.
[11:16.08]Can you hear me?
[11:16.82]I mean, you're muffled, but I mean, it kind of works.
[11:19.79]I'm not one to judge.
[11:23.27]Okay.
[11:23.91]Oh, my God.
[11:25.11]Alright, then!
[11:25.87]Jesus, did you get stung?
[11:27.09]You guys are old.
[11:32.91]Give me that.
[11:33.37]What the hell is that?
[11:34.39]It looks like Snow-Mizer.
[11:37.33]What did you say that I look like?
[11:39.83]Snow-Mizer from that movie, The Christmas Show.
[11:42.19]Everybody says that!
[11:45.19]I think I look like Giga-Chat.
[11:48.79]Giga-Chat?
[11:50.21]What was it?
[11:50.93]You're the most handsomest.
[11:53.11]Thank you.
[11:53.71]Oh, yes, of course I am.
[11:55.09]Why are the rats speaking English?
[11:57.33]I taught them.
[11:58.41]It took me a few years, but I taught them everything they know.
[12:02.15]What else do they know?
[12:03.35]Ranboo, you have to make a decision.
[12:07.49]Okay.
[12:07.87]You have all these people here sitting before you.
[12:11.54]All of them probably have a story and all of them probably want to live, right?
[12:16.14]I would imagine they want to live.
[12:18.42]Do you want to live?
[12:19.56]I'd love to live, actually.
[12:23.37]Sorry, I'm a little slow.
[12:26.45]It had a large pasta with shrimp.
[12:28.73]It only had like three shrimp on it.
[12:30.81]I got a little bloated.
[12:34.29]When I had dessert, though, let me tell you, it was a bad day to be a cheesecake.
[12:39.98]I'll tell you that much.
[12:42.06]Anyways.
[12:44.76]We're going to hear from these people and you're going to have to decide who lives.
[12:49.06]Oh, great.
[12:49.80]And who dies.
[12:51.54]I can't do that.
[12:52.34]And so will they.
[12:53.66]That's awesome.
[12:54.16]He's a genius.
[12:54.96]Please, please, please.
[12:56.96]Maybe if we heard from them each, we would be able to determine if they wanted to live or not and come with you.
[13:02.51]The others...
[13:08.72]We're going to explode.
[13:09.94]And I would not even think about coming over here and stopping me, Ranboo, considering that if I press this... Oh my god!
[13:22.91]Oh, shit.
[13:23.49]Okay.
[13:27.25]I hope that was nobody on my team.
[13:28.55]Did someone just die?
[13:30.57]I wish it was me.
[13:31.39]No, it is.
[13:32.15]No?
[13:33.17]Okay.
[13:35.38]This is the right one!
[13:36.76]Okay, okay.
[13:38.40]Oh, you know, check on Larry and Anthony.
[13:45.30]Just for a sec, make sure, because I think they might be in some trouble.
[13:49.98]That room is probably not going to be able to be used now.
[13:52.34]If I press this button, you all die.
[13:55.74]Okay, okay.
[13:57.06]Shall we determine?
[13:59.26]Shall we determine?
[14:02.80]Really?
[14:03.46]What?
[14:03.94]What do you want me to do?
[14:07.47]Is somebody screaming?
[14:08.81]Is that what I hear?
[14:09.79]What?
[14:10.13]I mean, what?
[14:11.83]Is something, dude?
[14:12.47]What was that?
[14:13.91]Is that a doctor out there, dude?
[14:15.23]What?
[14:16.11]What are you saying, dude?
[14:16.98]What is that, dude?
[14:18.50]I think it was just a guy.
[14:19.64]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[14:22.24]I'm in a bad way.
[14:24.16]I'm in a really bad way.
[14:25.68]I can't see anything.
[14:27.16]What is happening?
[14:27.64]He's not dead.
[14:28.54]The guy from the last room.
[14:29.86]He's not dead.
[14:35.92]I have to, oh shit, what?
[14:38.23]Oh no, what is this?
[14:41.35]I'm sorry about this, this was not supposed to be this way.
[14:43.79]Is this your day-to-day?
[14:46.93]This is quite the wiggle.
[14:47.77]Just bring him in, bring him in, bring him in, bring him in.
[14:49.79]Who is that, the doctor?
[14:51.99]I have to go to the emergency room.
[14:54.41]It's the guy that I tore into.
[14:56.11]My wheels are locked.
[14:57.04]I'm all locked up.
[14:57.84]You tore into a guy?
[14:59.92]He made me tear into this guy.
[15:02.10]I don't think that you should place the blame.
[15:05.46]I didn't tell him to do anything.
[15:06.54]I told him to attack.
[15:08.48]Sorry.
[15:08.74]You never said that.
[15:09.98]I just ripped fat ass right near the arm.
[15:13.02]I'm so sorry.
[15:13.76]And we're supposed to trust?
[15:14.89]He's supposed to help us.
[15:16.11]We're screwed.
[15:16.91]Listen only to me, not to him.
[15:18.45]Oh fuck, that's a fucking door!
[15:20.39]Oh shit!
[15:20.89]Who taught these rats how to drive?
[15:22.55]Man!
[15:23.53]Who taught these rats?
[15:24.91]Oh fuck!
[15:26.97]Who taught these rats how to drive and make human grunt sounds?
[15:30.88]What the fuck is this dude?
[15:33.61]What is wrong with these rats?
[15:38.68]All my bits and bobs are out.
[15:40.88]What the fuck?
[15:42.66]Is that fucking Gigachad?
[15:44.50]Dude, it's me, MegaChad.
[15:46.16]What's up, man?
[15:47.06]There's only one Gigachad.
[15:50.36]I need some help, doctor.
[15:52.00]Just quiet.
[15:53.18]Alright, alright.
[15:54.32]Shall we begin?
[15:56.47]You need to decide who moves on.
[15:59.69]Okay.
[16:00.09]Begin!
[16:00.35]I'm just coming over there.
[16:02.31]Do I need to take care of you?
[16:03.99]What does that mean?
[16:04.65]Yes, please, dude.
[16:05.97]I'm looking all over.
[16:07.05]I was just going to touch it.
[16:09.25]Up and down.
[16:09.83]Up and down.
[16:17.41]Didn't do anything?
[16:18.63]Told you he's a genius.
[16:21.13]Oh shit.
[16:21.91]Is it this?
[16:22.35]Is it the numbers or something?
[16:23.61]Do I press a number?
[16:25.49]I don't think so.
[16:26.69]Back away, back away!
[16:27.50]Okay, okay, okay.
[16:30.08]All people that come and try to save us, we got the actual Sherlock Holmes.
[16:38.34]What is that?
[16:38.86]I mean, I did mess around with a couple of the wires a little bit.
[16:43.17]Pardon?
[16:43.71]Fucking hand.
[16:46.04]Is the light good for you?
[16:47.36]How's the temperature in the room, too, by the way?
[16:48.64]Yeah, it's fine.
[16:48.95]It's a little warm, but I mean, it's a little warm.
[16:51.41]I thought I had a cool, clean, crisp shimmy.
[16:53.65]It's really cold for me.
[16:54.85]I don't know if you can stop talking.
[16:56.59]I don't know what may have happened to this machine that was working five seconds ago.
[17:00.43]I mean, is it... I'll get in there and I'll spin it, goddamn it.
[17:06.25]Wait, hold on.
[17:06.67]I think I can... Is it... Wait.
[17:11.20]Oh, there we go.
[17:13.30]Oh, yes!
[17:15.13]Oh, it worked!
[17:16.04]Yay!
[17:17.26]I'm so happy.
[17:18.36]I'm so happy.
[17:19.42]This is so great.
[17:22.20]I can see a different wall now.
[17:23.62]This is awesome.
[17:24.26]There we are.
[17:24.84]Okay, let's hear it for our next contestant, please.
[17:27.46]Alright.
[17:27.88]Hello.
[17:28.68]I'm very good and helpful and not high maintenance and perfect in every way that you can think of.
[17:35.37]Please get me home to my many child, children, wives, women.
[17:40.03]I love women.
[17:40.83]Lying is not going to save you in this situation.
[17:44.53]I'm not lying.
[17:45.35]Why would I lie?
[17:46.09]Why would I lie?
[17:46.95]Look me in the eye.
[17:48.45]Look me in the eye.
[17:50.69]Look me in the eye.
[17:51.95]I love my children.
[17:53.92]He doesn't.
[17:55.98]I do.
[17:56.34]He doesn't.
[17:57.16]I do love my children.
[17:58.22]Tell me one more time.
[17:59.74]I love my children.
[18:02.46]Are they real?
[18:03.52]Yes, they're real.
[18:04.52]They're very real.
[18:05.36]What are their names, dude?
[18:06.56]Name them.
[18:07.14]All of them.
[18:07.68]Steve.
[18:08.04]How many?
[18:08.57]How many?
[18:08.95]Several.
[18:09.39]There's seven.
[18:10.97]No.
[18:11.51]I said several.
[18:12.17]That means four or more.
[18:13.35]That means seven in my brain.
[18:14.39]OK.
[18:14.87]That's what I was thinking, too.
[18:16.61]I don't have seven.
[18:17.63]I have four children.
[18:18.53]Name them.
[18:19.03]Steve.
[18:19.51]Yeah.
[18:20.13]And Billy.
[18:20.77]Billy.
[18:21.25]Johnny.
[18:21.71]Johnny.
[18:22.09]Sally.
[18:22.57]Sally.
[18:22.85]What are their grades?
[18:26.10]What did Billy get in science?
[18:29.42]D minus.
[18:31.66]He's not old enough.
[18:36.33]I believe.
[18:38.92]children.
[18:39.24]I love them very much.
[18:40.14]I miss the Billy Steen.
[18:41.66]Are you okay in here, by the way?
[18:45.30]I'm feeling something, like a rumbly, I don't know what it is, but some sort of discomfort.
[18:50.39]If I could just get someone to check that out.
[18:52.13]I've just been waiting.
[18:53.87]There's a big whole line.
[18:55.07]I know I was in the other room, but I had these very nice rodents.
[18:57.39]Can we do the next contestant, please?
[18:59.27]While we figure this out.
[19:00.33]It just feels like gas
[19:01.59]Ratsy or something.
[19:02.41]Rats, please take that back.
[19:03.85]I'm sorry, it's just a lot.
[19:05.47]I just have a lot going on in there.
[19:07.05]What is wrong?
[19:07.37]I think we should take care of that.
[19:09.15]Yeah, it doesn't really like pressure.
[19:11.50]If you can just get in there, I'll tell you where I feel it, central-wise.
[19:14.78]Why do I have to do it?
[19:15.72]Can you hold that for a second?
[19:16.56]Just get in there.
[19:17.08]Don't press it.
[19:17.80]Oh my god, I'll fucking die!
[19:20.56]Oh, yeah, dude.
[19:21.72]What are you doing?
[19:22.94]Don't hold that correctly.
[19:24.02]What does that do?
[19:24.72]Impressive.
[19:25.30]You said it hurts in here.
[19:26.14]Why?
[19:26.76]No, it just hurts in there.
[19:27.78]You can keep talking.
[19:28.60]Oh, no, take your time.
[19:29.88]Yeah, no, it's great.
[19:31.26]It's like central.
[19:32.36]It's like very belly button center.
[19:33.30]I have a lot of children.
[19:34.09]I love my children very much.
[19:35.43]This is my natural sort of mood.
[19:36.61]Please get me out of here.
[19:37.73]Everyone makes that, alright?
[19:39.31]Children!
[19:39.91]It's just a little mucus, dude.
[19:41.17]I'm just phlegmy.
[19:42.15]It's a phlegmy fucking day.
[19:43.31]Heterosexual relationship.
[19:44.57]What in here?
[19:45.95]Alright.
[19:47.27]I have a fish.
[19:48.15]Listen, things are the way they are, dude.
[19:49.95]That actually was a sneeze.
[19:51.16]I'm very wet, and this guy's very straight.
[19:52.92]I mean, everyone can just see this stuff.
[19:54.46]What is this?
[19:55.26]What?
[19:56.90]What the hell is that?
[19:58.30]Oh, that feels much better, dude.
[20:00.16]Thank you, man.
[20:01.58]Oh, fuck.
[20:02.67]A hat.
[20:03.29]Just pull out a hat.
[20:04.17]A hat?
[20:05.11]Does this fit you?
[20:06.05]Maybe you are a doctor, man.
[20:08.11]Don't call me that.
[20:08.73]You're a plastic surgeon.
[20:09.79]No, I'm a tinkerer.
[20:11.15]There's a difference.
[20:12.71]You tinkered me, dude.
[20:13.73]You solved my fucking puzzle.
[20:14.99]I'm a tinkerer.
[20:15.83]Alright, thanks, man.
[20:16.87]Don't call me that.
[20:17.35]You called me a doctor.
[20:19.19]What a moron.
[20:20.07]Shut up.
[20:21.28]The rat can fucking talk.
[20:23.36]This does not work on me at all.
[20:25.16]It's my snapback, man.
[20:26.16]I swallowed that a few years ago.
[20:27.36]What do you think?
[20:29.88]I think it would look good, too.
[20:31.86]Right now.
[20:33.84]I think this one's good on me.
[20:35.16]Oh, no, no, no.
[20:37.10]I'm never listening to you again.
[20:40.01]Too wet.
[20:40.47]I want to hear from another contestant.
[20:41.87]That was nice to hear from you and all of your children, by the way.
[20:44.87]Please, thank you.
[20:46.95]Stop interrupting him.
[20:52.61]He's talking to you.
[20:55.09]Just that much to say, does he?
[20:56.79]No, I'm not a god, but I can understand if I can sense him.
[21:01.19]Maybe it'll work on Frank.
[21:02.45]Oh, my God.
[21:05.61]Do you like it?
[21:07.03]Do you like it?
[21:07.57]You're sick.
[21:08.13]Yeah, I know.
[21:09.48]I'm very sick.
[21:10.22]I have children.
[21:11.38]Yes.
[21:12.26]Well, you named them all.
[21:13.04]Name them again.
[21:15.10]Steve, Billy, John.
[21:17.26]Steve, Billy, John.
[21:18.52]What's the fourth one?
[21:20.18]What was the fourth one?
[21:22.33]Sally.
[21:22.85]Good for you.
[21:23.77]My children make me laugh.
[21:24.79]That doesn't work on Frank.
[21:26.39]That doesn't work on Frank.
[21:28.25]But Frank is a choice, which again,
[21:32.31]They will make, and you will make.
[21:35.35]Why don't we love this Frank ID?
[21:40.57]Sort of.
[21:42.27]It matches you, doesn't it?
[21:44.72]Sure, man.
[21:45.64]I'm not really a hack guy, but whatever.
[21:46.94]Does it match?
[21:48.10]I think it matches very well.
[21:50.06]How does that look?
[21:51.80]I think it looks beautiful.
[21:53.20]Oh, dude.
[21:56.51]It looks great.
[21:57.41]Oh, you'd fucking dominate.
[22:02.24]Do you have anything else up there that we didn't know about?
[22:04.00]I might, honestly.
[22:05.00]I'm just thinking after things have been pulled out.
[22:07.46]Any new telephones?
[22:09.08]You want to see if I have the new iPhone inside me?
[22:12.28]Every year I swallow the new one to sort of keep a scourge.
[22:15.45]I am the cloud.
[22:16.07]Why am I touching it again?
[22:17.07]I'm the fucking cloud.
[22:18.41]I'm going to need to wash my hands and we use extra alcohol on it because it's disgusting.
[22:22.90]Might have some of that in me too, yeah.
[22:24.40]Really?
[22:25.02]Yeah.
[22:26.28]Blood alcohol, it's like 90% blood alcohol.
[22:29.22]Can we please continue with the game, please?
[22:32.42]I'm sick of listening to this, and I'm sick of listening to this.
[22:34.48]I'm sick of hearing about children that don't exist.
[22:36.78]They exist, many of them, all of them do.
[22:39.94]I actually, I really have to go to the bathroom.
[22:42.44]What?
[22:43.46]Yeah, I have to get out of here.
[22:44.92]I have to go to the bathroom.
[22:46.19]What?
[22:51.44]How bad do you have to go to the bathroom?
[22:53.60]Pretty bad.
[22:54.36]Pretty bad?
[22:55.15]Yeah, like nobody wants to witness what's about to happen, mad.
[22:58.37]Oh, shit.
[22:59.61]Please, God, no.
[23:00.59]Wait, what?
[23:03.79]Do you want to... What?
[23:05.59]Do you want to... What?
[23:07.88]Oh, my... Jesus Christ.
[23:09.22]No, what are you talking about?
[23:11.08]Is that what you... What do you... Do you... Hold on.
[23:13.30]You ever got on an airplane before?
[23:15.64]Take off and land and you have to hold it.
[23:17.38]That's exactly what you're doing.
[23:18.74]Okay, but like in an emergency situation where like maybe the airplane's gonna be full of a stench of sorts, they might make an exception.
[23:26.18]I just gotta go, I gotta go.
[23:28.48]One or two.
[23:37.97]Yes.
[23:40.39]It's a mix.
[23:41.21]It's a fucking slurry, dude.
[23:43.56]I don't want to hear that.
[23:45.18]No need ever again.
[23:46.20]Don't want to see that at all.
[23:54.28]Yeah, of course, I'm okay.
[23:57.06]I gotta go.
[23:58.12]My hands are so slippery.
[24:01.17]I really, really have to use the bathroom.
[24:03.65]I'll be right back, okay?
[24:04.67]Down the hall, to the right, straight ahead, around the corner.
[24:07.99]Right.
[24:09.29]Hey, and I give good directions.
[24:11.13]If you go to a restaurant, you ask where the bathroom is, and they say right around the corner.
[24:14.84]And it's never around the corner.
[24:16.40]And there's stairs you have to go down.
[24:18.48]I fuck those people that do that.
[24:20.14]You ever been in that position?
[24:21.32]No, yeah, no, it makes sense.
[24:22.32]Then there's like three different doorways and everything.
[24:24.56]It doesn't make any sense.
[24:25.34]It's really annoying.
[24:26.08]No signs.
[24:27.18]It's incredibly annoying.
[24:29.12]You and I are connecting on this.
[24:31.36]Why don't we give him a spin?
[24:33.08]We can't go on until he gets to do his.
[24:34.90]Just a spin?
[24:35.66]Okay.
[24:35.96]Give him a spin.
[24:38.27]Everybody has to go in order or I will freak out.
[24:45.85]Is it fun?
[24:47.48]Is it fun with all of your children?
[24:49.75]Your kids would love this, Dean!
[24:52.86]Hey, let me go in there.
[24:54.78]Hey, come in here.
[24:55.36]He needs to see his fish.
[24:57.27]Hey, we're all spinning around.
[25:00.71]Help me.
[25:01.41]I just want to get back to this.
[25:03.33]Help me.
[25:04.21]I just want to get back to this.
[25:06.37]Help me.
[25:06.65]I just want to get back to this.
[25:09.53]Help.
[25:09.91]I am not moving.
[25:11.65]Actually, we could probably make a Wizard of Oz, you know, collector, puzzler.
[25:16.46]You know, children, lots of them.
[25:18.54]What's my... I'd be useful.
[25:20.18]Oh, there's only four people in the Wizard of Oz, sorry.
[25:25.48]Sorry, only four people.
[25:26.82]It's OK.
[25:28.19]Oh, excellent, though.
[25:29.69]So, have we heard from everyone?
[25:33.03]I believe we have.
[25:34.85]So, now it is time... ..for them to pick some.
[25:42.26]You have to pick who moves on.
[25:44.44]Remember, everyone else, boop, explodes.
[25:50.11]The devices around their neck, as you've probably seen already, will blow their heads off and take everything.
[25:57.67]I mean, oh.
[25:58.39]Everything.
[26:00.17]Get in there and scare them.
[26:02.67]Get in there and scare them.
[26:05.53]Make your choice.
[26:07.59]on who you would like to bring forward in the game.
[26:11.31]No, don't kill me.
[26:12.41]I have children and a wife.
[26:14.31]We're probably just going to take it.
[26:15.97]No, you're not.
[26:16.53]How could you?
[26:17.77]How could you?
[26:18.37]Do you have children?
[26:21.01]Yes.
[26:22.49]What are their names?
[26:23.19]Hundreds of them.
[26:24.71]Hundreds?
[26:25.19]In every state, in every country.
[26:27.34]Dude, he's like a frog.
[26:28.56]He just spawns.
[26:30.42]Oh, shit.
[26:32.54]Oh, my God.
[26:33.04]So you know what I'm talking about?
[26:34.36]I do.
[26:35.02]You and I relate.
[26:37.56]Have they decided?
[26:39.00]You only get to bring two, by the way.
[26:42.32]They pick one, and you pick one.
[26:45.83]Do you think maybe I could fit through the door frame?
[26:47.67]Do you like pulleys?
[26:49.09]I don't know how you're even still talking.
[26:50.67]You should have died at least 30 minutes ago.
[26:54.15]And stop it!
[26:59.96]Oh.
[27:00.30]Duck.
[27:00.48]Duck.
[27:01.48]Oh, no.
[27:02.08]Duck.
[27:02.47]Duck.
[27:03.97]Oh, I hate ducks.
[27:04.43]Do we have a winner?
[27:09.51]Oh.
[27:09.69]I'm out of ducks.
[27:10.73]It's freaking me out.
[27:12.61]Duck.
[27:12.95]Oh, it's another one.
[27:16.89]Duck.
[27:17.60]Oh, fuck.
[27:18.46]Oh, fuck.
[27:22.32]Ghost!
[27:22.96]Oh!
[27:23.20]Fuck.
[27:25.52]Oh.
[27:27.74]I don't know about that one, man.
[27:29.26]I think maybe you should pick the person in the red.
[27:31.72]She seems like she's got, like, a good thing going.
[27:34.08]She's really nice, she said.
[27:36.94]I feel like that's the person that, like... If I were voting, like, I'd probably pick... Wait, I don't get to pick?
[27:44.06]No, I'm just saying.
[27:44.68]No, they got the pick.
[27:45.78]Oh, I thought I did.
[27:47.46]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[27:48.84]I'm hearing voices and seeing lights and shit.
[27:51.52]I thought I got the pick.
[27:54.04]Isn't this your game?
[27:55.24]Can't you make that call?
[27:57.50]I was going to pick you.
[27:58.40]It's you!
[27:59.08]I'll get over it.
[28:03.21]I thought I was going to pick you.
[28:04.45]It's okay, man.
[28:05.25]It's how it goes.
[28:08.16]I thought about it.
[28:09.50]I thought about it.
[28:10.39]I mean, I guess, do I have a choice?
[28:13.83]Yes, you do.
[28:14.35]Okay, I mean, I guess he seemed so excited about going, I mean, just pick him.
[28:20.52]I mean, I wanted to pick him, too.
[28:22.60]Sure, yeah, let's have him go.
[28:24.76]Do you get to go?
[28:25.90]Oh, actually, it is you!
[28:26.88]Yes, go on, get him out, too!
[28:28.28]Oh my god, we're gonna die.
[28:29.90]We're gonna die, you're never gonna see your kids again.
[28:32.70]I'm never gonna see my fish again, you're gonna fucking die.
[28:37.13]That also means, by the way... I'm just gonna take Frank, that's alright.
[28:41.07]I'm just gonna take him with us, he's gonna be amazing.
[28:42.63]You're gonna take Frank?
[28:44.91]If you heard his introduction, I mean, it was amazing.
[28:47.55]He was a guy.
[28:48.31]I mean, he really was a character.
[28:49.69]It's just... Give me this.
[28:53.53]Give me this one.
[28:54.07]What are you doing to Frank, man?
[28:55.39]You're not taking this one.
[28:56.63]What do you mean?
[28:57.59]She's great.
[28:58.13]Where's she going?
[28:59.01]Yeah, we're a fan.
[28:59.81]We're charge geeks.
[29:00.69]They're just nice.
[29:02.65]I guess cool.
[29:03.47]That's great.
[29:03.99]That's fine.
[29:06.59]Oh!
[29:07.03]No, dude!
[29:08.15]No, dude!
[29:08.83]Alright, I guess Frank's not coming.
[29:13.57]Frank's not coming.
[29:14.57]I'll come back for you.
[29:15.39]I will tell you.
[29:17.17]For those of you that have made it through, you're not quite going to go that easily.
[29:23.03]You're not quite going to go that easily, because see there?
[29:28.19]You have a long way to go.
[29:30.85]And they're going to be able to help you.
[29:33.39]You see, once you get inside, it's very dark and it's very hard to see.
[29:38.38]There may be some guidance from some people, possibly.
[29:43.26]Good luck on the way through to the next room.
[29:47.10]It's going to be impossible.
[29:49.19]They'll never be able to solve the riddle.
[29:51.67]They'll never be able to solve it.
[29:53.43]Will they?
[29:54.35]Just to be clear, he did say that in him, the key thing, that guy is, I don't even know how he's still alive.
[30:00.93]He really sold that he didn't tell you that.
[30:03.49]Are you really going to believe him?
[30:05.75]He was going to pick me, so maybe, I mean, I kind of do.
[30:08.49]He came out on a TV.
[30:11.71]It was disgusting what you did.
[30:15.99]Does he know he can hear us?
[30:19.27]I can hear him.
[30:20.23]Does he know we can hear him?
[30:22.19]Oh yeah, I can hear you too.
[30:24.55]Welcome.
[30:25.75]Okay, what are we doing in here?
[30:27.29]Yeah, what is this?
[30:28.47]Welcome to the candy room.
[30:30.15]Candy room?
[30:31.77]But there's a mushroom.
[30:33.39]There could be mushrooms in a candy room.
[30:35.67]Okay, sure.
[30:38.05]Your goal in this room, the three of you, will have to do something very specific.
[30:42.41]Don't touch everything in the room just yet.
[30:47.38]The goal with this room is to play a game, and that game is Mousetrap, the most fucked up game in existence.
[30:59.06]The hardest game, the worst game.
[31:02.76]Is this like a version that's gonna kill us all, or?
[31:06.24]Oh, it will.
[31:08.92]Why are we playing a board game in a candy room?
[31:11.50]It wasn't like a candy puzzle, or?
[31:13.70]Well, I mean,
[31:15.21]I do other shit here, guys.
[31:16.93]But it's a candy room.
[31:17.69]You don't have, like, a candy puzzle?
[31:19.27]No, I mean, honestly, if you tell... The strawberries taste like strawberries.
[31:22.43]Give it a try.
[31:24.23]How do you think I pay for half of this stuff?
[31:25.77]The wall?
[31:26.34]Yeah, oh, yeah.
[31:28.14]No, I... No, dude, that's... No.
[31:29.84]Is this, like, a thing you do?
[31:31.02]The bananas taste like bananas.
[31:32.34]The strawberries taste like strawberries.
[31:33.60]I'm not... I'm not gonna do that.
[31:34.24]Everything is delicious.
[31:34.74]Is this, like, a thing... You try to get people to lick your wall?
[31:37.08]No, I make a lot of money doing all kinds of things.
[31:39.16]You think I just torture and hurt people?
[31:40.78]No.
[31:41.06]How do you... What do you think I... You ain't gonna make money getting me to lick the wall.
[31:44.31]I don't just do weird stuff.
[31:47.57]Seems like you do predominantly weird stuff, given the situation.
[31:50.90]Okay, if you don't want to taste the wall, then that's fine.
[31:53.16]I'm not tasting the wall, dude.
[31:54.24]That's so weird.
[31:55.28]You have two hours.
[31:56.64]Why don't you do it?
[31:57.72]Why don't you do it?
[31:58.26]You're going to do it?
[31:59.66]No, I'm alright.
[32:00.92]Alright.
[32:01.42]We're not tasting the wall, man.
[32:03.42]We don't want to do my craft.
[32:05.04]You don't want to partake in my craft.
[32:07.26]I think I would have been more willing if there was like a candy puzzle.
[32:10.62]Well, regardless how you feel about my exquisite craft, you have two hours to set up Mousetrap and simply let the thing work once.
[32:23.33]You just have to have it do the Rube Goldberg one time, which is one of the most impossible tasks in human history.
[32:31.50]Everybody knows that it's always very difficult to even find the pieces for Mousetrap, which you'll have to find as well.
[32:39.43]Some of them are missing.
[32:41.61]Open it up, get the instructions, try to get at least one rotation, or you all die.
[32:49.42]Brats, start the timer.
[32:51.38]It's not going.
[32:55.08]Oh, yay!
[32:56.78]You are doing mousetraps.
[32:57.80]Play a game of mousetrap, I guess.
[33:01.27]It's fucking impossible.
[33:02.95]You consider it a hobby?
[33:04.85]What do you think you're doing here?
[33:06.73]Is this your hobby?
[33:08.08]Of course it is.
[33:09.09]It's a hobby, they say.
[33:10.49]You know how long this took to set everything up?
[33:13.03]Make sure you read the instructions if you don't know how it works.
[33:16.73]The instructions aren't even in English.
[33:18.93]They aren't?
[33:19.79]No.
[33:20.87]I don't even know if that's a language.
[33:23.87]Wait, the instructions aren't in English?
[33:25.73]No.
[33:27.88]Are you sure you're okay?
[33:29.62]Wait, what?
[33:31.22]No, it's just like, it's not English.
[33:34.28]It's just like weird symbols.
[33:37.41]Is this like, is this like a thing for you?
[33:38.75]Is this what you like to do?
[33:39.81]Give us a board game with like no, no direction or?
[33:44.01]I thought it was going to be a directions in there.
[33:45.98]I'm sorry.
[33:46.74]I got it at a yard sale.
[33:48.96]Oh my God.
[33:50.04]Do you want to know the reason, dude?
[33:51.66]Why no mousetrap games ever complete?
[33:53.94]It's because I find, I find each and every box and I swallow one to two of the pieces, dude.
[33:59.01]So give that back.
[34:00.49]Oh, hey, hey kids, it's time for dinner.
[34:03.23]Right?
[34:04.35]You never get it finished.
[34:05.61]Hey kids, it's time for dinner.
[34:08.97]And he just goes back under the bed.
[34:10.77]Goes onto the couch again.
[34:12.43]Did you check all of them?
[34:14.11]I did check all of them.
[34:16.15]I'm so diabolical.
[34:17.33]I'm so diabolical.
[34:18.29]I mean, you did have one outside of the room, though.
[34:21.95]Well, it was inside of somebody.
[34:24.87]So I was supposed to go inside of him?
[34:27.07]What?
[34:28.24]I mean, I was supposed to put my hands, tear him open.
[34:31.34]I was supposed to do that?
[34:33.22]Ew.
[34:34.88]Well, I mean, let's not dwell on that very much.
[34:43.72]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, candy on the ground.
[34:47.52]You said it's somewhere in the room.
[34:48.84]You said it's in the room.
[34:50.00]I didn't say fuck all my shit up.
[34:52.77]Well, I'm going to find the piece somehow, right?
[34:57.43]Hey, sorry about the mess, man.
[34:59.87]It's okay.
[35:01.13]I just, did they do this?
[35:02.47]When I was younger, me and my siblings used to play this game all the time.
[35:06.77]Spill the candy, or?
[35:07.77]And the one thing is, sometimes, sometimes I would be the one that would hide the piece on my brother, and sometimes they would hide it on me.
[35:15.46]Guys, I think it's in one of the drawers.
[35:16.94]And we would get to the very, Jesus!
[35:18.58]Oh!
[35:19.18]Oh my God!
[35:21.46]Oh, I'm so sorry, I am so sorry, I'm so sorry.
[35:23.88]Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
[35:26.10]I am so sorry.
[35:30.83]Oh, that's not good.
[35:33.15]She scared the shit out of me.
[35:34.41]I'm sorry.
[35:34.83]I was in the middle of the story.
[35:35.87]I didn't mean to do that.
[35:37.51]You were in there the whole time?
[35:39.47]Yeah.
[35:40.65]And you were like, don't go in there.
[35:42.96]I had a whole thing planned when I was going to come.
[35:46.00]Guys, I'm still alive.
[35:48.18]Guys, guys, I'm bleeding out.
[35:50.24]Help, please, I'm still alive.
[35:52.22]Please help me.
[35:53.22]Guys, I'm still alive.
[35:55.52]Hey, hey, hey, guys, guys, it's cold.
[36:01.17]I don't know what's happening.
[36:02.07]I am so sorry about this.
[36:03.73]I can't see anything.
[36:04.69]Oh, damn it.
[36:05.73]I can't see anything.
[36:06.85]This is not what I wanted.
[36:07.95]This is not how this is supposed to be.
[36:09.41]Guys, guys, guys.
[36:18.45]The whole thing that there was going to be monsters that came out of the room and attacked and were going to jump and scare everybody, but I was in the middle of a story talking about when I was a kid and she opened it and scared the shit out of me.
[36:30.89]You killed one of our guys.
[36:33.49]You need this.
[36:36.04]Oh.
[36:37.16]Can you hold this for a second?
[36:38.52]Just for one second.
[36:40.18]Just hold it for a second.
[36:40.82]I don't think that's how you... Oh, wait a minute.
[36:43.80]Hold on.
[36:44.08]Don't move, by the way.
[36:46.88]Can you hold that?
[36:47.60]Yeah, yeah.
[36:52.14]So I have the piece, the last piece.
[36:54.20]So it goes in here, right?
[36:59.15]Do you want to come and see?
[37:00.37]I think that's how it works.
[37:02.65]I'm so sorry about that, by the way.
[37:04.55]It's alright, man.
[37:06.55]Take a look.
[37:09.25]Oh, shit.
[37:10.54]I think we need another one to go in here.
[37:12.10]Oh.
[37:12.40]They're supposed to be...
[37:17.29]Who didn't put it here?
[37:18.93]Is there supposed to be another one?
[37:22.38]There's another one right here, and then... I think there's one at one marble.
[37:26.10]Oh, there is another ball, isn't there?
[37:27.58]Like this one?
[37:30.02]Oh, okay.
[37:30.56]Let's try that.
[37:31.40]Do you want to do it?
[37:32.64]No, you got it, man.
[37:33.30]You got it.
[37:33.60]No, he's got it.
[37:34.10]He's got it.
[37:34.46]Can I see that?
[37:34.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[37:35.64]Do you want to press the button?
[37:54.58]You've got to kick the bucket, man.
[37:59.52]You've got to kick the bucket?
[38:01.15]Not literally.
[38:01.83]I'm trying.
[38:02.47]You guys are good at this.
[38:03.87]I'll do what I can.
[38:07.38]It keeps on missing.
[38:08.38]Okay, so basically what you've got to do is you've got to hit that, you've got to kick the bucket.
[38:12.47]Yeah, what you have to do is you have to go like that.
[38:14.59]Yeah, you've got to kick that bucket.
[38:16.19]You've just got to do that.
[38:18.03]Almost.
[38:18.47]Almost there.
[38:19.01]No, yeah, so that bucket.
[38:20.37]I'm trying, I'm trying, okay?
[38:22.24]I'm trying my best.
[38:23.46]Not that much.
[38:24.50]I think this is just effective.
[38:25.62]It's just faulty.
[38:26.30]I think this is boring.
[38:26.98]It's a piece of shit.
[38:27.82]I think this is boring.
[38:28.80]So have you tried hitting the bucket?
[38:30.42]Hold on, take this out.
[38:31.96]Get that out of there.
[38:37.65]Does that count?
[38:41.13]You tell me!
[38:41.69]It's caught!
[38:41.93]We got the mouse!
[38:42.51]Yeah!
[38:42.75]Yeah, we did it!
[38:44.58]Yeah!
[38:44.72]We did it!
[38:44.98]Yes!
[38:45.08]Yeah, we did it!
[38:45.70]I feel great about that!
[38:47.94]Alright!
[38:48.72]Oh my god!
[38:49.22]Okay.
[39:02.71]Hey, you know, I feel really bad about this.
[39:06.53]Yeah.
[39:07.57]I'll give you another person.
[39:08.87]Does that make sense?
[39:09.87]Sure.
[39:10.51]That's fair, right?
[39:11.61]Is that fair?
[39:12.81]Mm-hmm.
[39:13.34]Stay fair.
[39:14.22]Because that was unfair?
[39:16.34]Yeah.
[39:17.50]Alright!
[39:18.34]Bring in another person!
[39:20.56]By the way, that other person has to go through the same diabolical pipes that the other ones did.
[39:27.48]Are they going to go through a bullet, too?
[39:29.38]Yes, they do.
[39:30.47]You hear that?
[39:31.97]Oh, there he is.
[39:34.25]Oh, you already connected the damn thing.
[39:37.29]Oh, I see.
[39:38.00]Hey, ma'am.
[39:38.88]Is she dead?
[39:40.14]Yeah.
[39:40.64]No.
[39:41.68]Yep.
[39:42.52]No.
[39:42.84]Nope.
[39:43.98]Who wants the instructions to this?
[39:45.26]I have to go.
[39:46.02]I have to get ready.
[39:47.26]Good.
[39:47.80]That's a good pick.
[39:48.76]That's a good pick.
[39:49.33]My pick.
[39:49.61]Yeah, we did pretty good.
[39:50.53]I have extra pieces if you need them.
[39:52.01]Alright, open, please.
[39:56.77]Thank you.
[40:01.46]Open the fucking door, you idiot.
[40:03.10]Fuck.
[40:06.70]She's, she's, she's... Hello again.
[40:10.50]What you see before you is a group of deadly lasers.
[40:15.08]If you touch the deadly lasers, you will get obliterated.
[40:19.82]And it never will fill a gas.
[40:23.04]Oh, see that diamond over there?
[40:25.72]I would reach it if I were you, because it's the only way to get out.
[40:29.61]Good luck.
[40:30.90]Guys, don't worry about it.
[40:39.71]I got this.
[40:40.95]I've done it before.
[40:41.91]How?
[40:42.39]Wait, you've done this before?
[40:43.99]When?
[40:44.47]How?
[40:46.33]Throw me.
[40:47.47]Throw you?
[40:48.33]Throw me.
[40:49.58]Like, through the lasers.
[40:50.90]Like, pick you up.
[40:52.22]Sure.
[40:52.62]Through the lasers.
[40:53.42]That direction.
[40:54.16]Yeah.
[40:54.88]Okay.
[40:55.10]I guess, yeah.
[40:55.76]One... Two...
[41:13.13]I did it.
[41:15.05]Guys, I made it.
[41:17.35]Yeah!
[41:18.67]Yeah, man!
[41:19.37]What?
[41:20.37]How?
[41:21.41]How?
[41:27.68]God damn it.
[41:29.66]Okay.
[41:30.32]I could fly.
[41:31.18]You could fly.
[41:31.94]I could fly.
[41:33.02]And I could prove it to you if you wanted to.
[41:34.58]I have the technology to do anything you've ever seen in your life.
[41:36.60]No, go ahead.
[41:37.08]Fly in front of us.
[41:38.22]Yeah, go ahead.
[41:39.54]Anyways, welcome.
[41:42.10]Unfortunately, you've lost another member of your party, haven't you?
[41:46.80]Yeah, we kind of threw him and then just didn't really work out.
[41:50.32]Yeah, I'm crying, man.
[41:51.82]Don't worry.
[41:52.33]No, it sucks that we lost him, honestly.
[41:54.01]I'm going to miss him.
[41:55.05]I saw.
[41:55.65]I saw with my third eye.
[41:58.35]I closed it and I saw a few things.
[42:01.59]I'm making sure that I send you...
[42:05.78]Another person.
[42:07.36]Because I feel like it's kind of unfair.
[42:09.26]And speaking of unfair, oh, puzzler, your puzzles are too easy.
[42:13.95]Oh, really?
[42:18.15]How does this one sound?
[42:20.51]Is this too easy?
[42:21.83]Does this look too easy?
[42:23.95]Looks like a, doesn't even look like anything, man.
[42:27.04]Nobody tells me my puzzles are too easy or I go ballistic.
[42:34.67]Good luck solving this one.
[42:37.86]You insolent, disgusting whelps!
[42:42.76]Silence!
[42:44.70]You vile whelps!
[42:48.40]I don't want to hear about how easy a puzzle is ever again.
[42:52.79]You understand me?
[42:55.45]I could be talking to anyone.
[42:58.85]Oh, is it too hard?
[43:02.10]It's too hard!
[43:04.42]Oh, we can't do it.
[43:06.97]Exactly what I thought.
[43:08.83]How about I just do it?
[43:09.83]Watch this.
[43:10.21]I'm going to use my fingers.
[43:11.25]Move this one.
[43:14.76]Twist that one.
[43:15.86]Move that one.
[43:16.48]Look at that.
[43:17.02]And look at how now I'm the smart one now.
[43:20.44]I'm the smart one now.
[43:22.62]Look at that.
[43:24.80]give me shit about my puzzles ever again.
[43:26.80]I'll press this detonator and you won't see anybody ever again.
[43:30.52]Here are your other party members.
[43:33.07]I'm being very generous here, Randall.
[43:34.89]Hey, man.
[43:35.49]You got out.
[43:36.85]That's amazing.
[43:38.45]Bonus.
[43:39.99]I think we're okay.
[43:42.33]We're okay.
[43:42.81]Except for this puzzle.
[43:44.66]Let me just show you.
[43:45.36]This is a lot better.
[43:47.64]Hey, what's up, man?
[43:49.12]I'm Steve.
[43:51.07]It's kind of nice in here, actually.
[43:52.33]It is.
[43:52.57]It's kind of cool.
[43:53.09]It's a wonderful time.
[43:54.04]I was so sure that we were going to die, but the other two are dead.
[43:57.82]Yeah, please.
[43:58.18]Yeah, they died.
[43:59.18]The other two are dead.
[44:00.20]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[44:01.08]Wait, wait, wait.
[44:01.76]There's a whole thing with mousetrap.
[44:03.25]Don't get near me.
[44:04.61]Is it your knee?
[44:05.29]Yes!
[44:05.95]It was my knee.
[44:07.13]Come on.
[44:07.61]I just wanted to check.
[44:09.35]That was rude.
[44:10.25]Sorry.
[44:10.45]I apologize.
[44:12.24]Hello.
[44:13.50]Welcome, everybody else.
[44:15.93]How are you?
[44:16.59]How are you?
[44:18.33]Great, man.
[44:18.73]Good.
[44:18.89]It's good to see you.
[44:19.75]Oh, man.
[44:20.57]I just want to make sure you look OK.
[44:23.21]You look pretty good.
[44:27.35]What are your children's names?
[44:31.65]Why don't you tell me the names of my children?
[44:33.43]I don't know.
[44:34.11]Since you're going to deprive me of them.
[44:35.75]Billy, Stephen, Stacy, and Jonathan.
[44:49.17]I have a Stacey.
[44:51.47]She's very beautiful.
[44:53.17]You're killing him.
[44:57.22]That's what I would have done in that scenario.
[45:00.92]Ranboo.
[45:02.10]Yes.
[45:02.84]Welcome to the next challenge.
[45:06.58]This challenge is very interesting.
[45:08.46]There's lots of stuff in here.
[45:10.36]Is this a closet?
[45:12.24]Could be.
[45:12.94]Are these all your clothes?
[45:13.88]This is your closet?
[45:14.64]Could be, yeah.
[45:15.43]Could be.
[45:16.65]There's a lot of women's clothing in here.
[45:18.47]A lot of wigs.
[45:19.11]I think there's no problem with that.
[45:21.57]Not at all.
[45:22.65]Nope.
[45:23.39]Anyways, if, uh, rats, um, direct them to turn around.
[45:30.54]I don't want them to see what I'm about to do.
[45:32.20]And by the way, don't forget who has this.
[45:34.85]Oh, yeah, that's true.
[45:36.31]Turn around.
[45:36.73]I don't want you to see anything.
[45:37.74]Turn around.
[45:38.44]Which direction?
[45:39.48]Go in the corner over here and turn around.
[45:41.10]Turn around.
[45:42.10]Go, go.
[45:42.92]Go.
[45:43.20]I'm scared.
[45:43.94]Let's just get it over with.
[45:48.44]Okay.
[45:48.93]Ah!
[45:49.33]God!
[45:49.97]What?
[45:50.53]Good.
[45:51.03]Good.
[45:51.33]That's extra pay for you.
[45:52.63]Extra pay.
[45:53.11]Can you relax, man?
[45:54.27]Extra pay.
[45:55.19]Extra pay.
[45:55.75]Don't even think about turning around.
[45:57.11]I'll blow you all to fucking hell.
[45:59.39]Do you wear all these shoes?
[46:01.76]So, this room, the only clue I'm going to give you.
[46:05.08]Oops, I was puking.
[46:08.28]The only cue and the only clue you get is appearances aren't all they seem.
[46:17.11]Appearances aren't all that they seem.
[46:20.03]Sometimes you need a change in perspective.
[46:28.57]I've gotten too fat to get through this.
[46:30.04]Can we turn yet or?
[46:31.36]No.
[46:31.84]Okay.
[46:32.54]I have gotten too fat to get through this.
[46:35.24]Through what?
[46:36.56]My ass is way too big.
[46:43.84]Shit.
[46:46.46]I may have actually fucked up my room.
[46:49.95]Don't turn around yet.
[46:50.99]Okay.
[46:51.87]Don't turn around yet.
[46:52.63]Just checking on you, man.
[46:53.65]Hey.
[46:55.20]You get busy looking at that.
[46:57.06]I'm looking at so much stuff right now.
[47:02.97]My ass actually was too big.
[47:04.39]My ass was too big to get through this.
[47:07.23]Hold the detonator for a second.
[47:09.05]Don't press the button, though.
[47:10.29]Is he just trying to... Is he just trying to tell us that his ass is big?
[47:14.27]Can we turn around now?
[47:19.93]No, you can't turn around yet.
[47:21.64]You want us to just like know your ass is big?
[47:23.18]Is that what this is going on?
[47:26.78]No, there's no, don't turn around until I tell you to.
[47:30.68]I had a little bit of a malfunction coming through the secret, incredibly deceptive thing.
[47:38.96]You can turn around.
[47:41.02]I think we're ready to get out of the room.
[47:42.92]I think that means we did it.
[47:44.12]I think we did it, guys.
[47:45.36]Nice job, guys.
[47:46.16]Why else would they come out?
[47:47.32]Nice job.
[47:47.90]Why else would they come out?
[47:48.76]Yeah.
[47:49.06]I don't know why I high-fived you twice.
[47:52.95]Well.
[47:54.55]Do I keep doing this?
[47:56.41]You know, I have an elevator.
[47:58.01]We need to make an elevator.
[47:59.09]That'd be nice.
[48:02.19]What the fuck are you doing?
[48:03.95]What?
[48:04.15]What do you mean?
[48:04.97]Looks can be deceiving.
[48:06.62]Change your appearance.
[48:08.44]Yeah.
[48:11.25]Thank you.
[48:12.11]You did say that.
[48:13.23]Who looks the best do we think?
[48:32.32]What do you think?
[48:34.20]This is what we're doing.
[48:36.06]Do you want us to do a little walk for it?
[48:37.48]Yeah, please do.
[48:38.93]This is all wrong, but everything you're doing is not what I intended.
[48:42.93]You can go first.
[48:44.91]You look great.
[48:45.49]Almost.
[48:45.75]It's okay.
[48:49.11]Take your time.
[48:49.86]Have you been drinking?
[48:51.30]Yes.
[48:52.48]Okay.
[48:53.04]Alright.
[48:53.72]Alright.
[48:54.52]Okay.
[48:57.90]Next, please.
[48:58.64]I didn't know we were having a party.
[49:00.52]That sounds like fun.
[49:01.30]I didn't know we were having a party.
[49:05.39]Those pants don't fit.
[49:07.47]Not even close.
[49:08.19]In fact, I think you might even, they might even be down to your thighs.
[49:14.25]Just a little something special for those that don't.
[49:16.80]Hey, hey!
[49:22.34]Do it again.
[49:23.55]Do it again, with a little bit of effort.
[49:26.14]Do it again.
[49:26.96]I'll do it again, man.
[49:27.86]I'll press it.
[49:30.18]Ooh!
[49:31.62]Yeah!
[49:32.40]A little bit of class.
[49:35.24]Alright!
[49:36.62]Okay!
[49:40.32]You're not even close, though.
[49:41.50]I mean, this is cool.
[49:42.44]What do you mean?
[49:43.52]You're not even close.
[49:44.48]Well, he hasn't done the walk yet.
[49:45.94]Yeah, well, you know, I can sure walk.
[49:48.82]Yeah.
[49:49.36]Let's see.
[49:54.45]Oh, my God.
[49:55.21]Can I go?
[49:56.19]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:58.23]I want to encourage him, man.
[50:02.79]The power.
[50:04.25]Yes.
[50:04.65]I know that's pretty good.
[50:05.95]Yeah, that's good.
[50:07.51]Yeah, that was really good.
[50:09.35]It was good.
[50:12.43]No, no, no.
[50:13.59]Keep it up.
[50:14.29]Keep it up.
[50:15.01]Turn around, please.
[50:16.19]Turn around.
[50:17.32]Again?
[50:17.62]Yeah, just one more time.
[50:18.80]Oh, my God.
[50:20.28]Not again.
[50:23.18]god damn I look so good oh god my jacket ripped he's gonna talk about his ass porn don't look there you go let's talk about his ass I didn't know they were doing that you guys did great they look awesome they look so good I'm a little pissed that this wasn't
[50:48.91]I just closed my fingers.
[50:49.81]Do you want to talk about your ass again?
[50:51.61]Don't worry about my ass.
[50:53.09]My ass is not your concern.
[50:54.79]You emphasized it a weird amount last time we did this.
[50:56.99]I was just checking.
[50:58.11]Yeah, I did, but hold on.
[50:59.63]I just took the panel off.
[51:01.74]Oops-a-daisy.
[51:03.24]You can turn around now.
[51:04.62]Oh, alright.
[51:07.78]Hey, somebody call a party?
[51:11.46]Somebody call for a party?
[51:13.23]Somebody call for a party?
[51:14.45]Hey, guys.
[51:16.75]Oh god, we made it just in time.
[51:19.12]You guys look good.
[51:20.70]Hey!
[51:21.68]What's up?
[51:22.20]What are you doing?
[51:23.86]You guys look really good.
[51:25.07]Do we look good?
[51:25.95]What are you doing?
[51:27.07]What are you doing?
[51:28.01]We're here for the party.
[51:29.23]What are you doing?
[51:30.01]What are you doing?
[51:30.71]We're trying to get out of here.
[51:32.83]I have children and wives.
[51:34.31]Wife!
[51:35.01]Wife!
[51:35.43]What wife?
[51:37.56]What is this?
[51:37.98]Some sort of game?
[51:38.82]We've been stuck in here for hours, it seems.
[51:41.72]We're trying to get out.
[51:44.22]He's pissed.
[51:45.50]Why is nobody else freaking out?
[51:48.00]We've got C4 strapped to our neck.
[51:49.92]I don't know what this puzzle is.
[51:53.72]We got rid of them.
[51:54.36]It wasn't the puzzle.
[51:55.40]He said that that wasn't it.
[51:56.56]Yeah, he said it wasn't it.
[52:02.54]How do we get out of here?
[52:04.42]Do you guys not fucking actually want to hang out?
[52:06.82]Is that what it is?
[52:07.92]What?
[52:08.36]Do you guys just like, do you actually just not want to fucking hang out with us?
[52:12.01]No, we want to get out of here, because we want to get out of here.
[52:14.58]I ordered beer.
[52:15.88]Scared of dying.
[52:16.76]You ordered beer?
[52:17.54]Where is it?
[52:17.94]I need one.
[52:18.88]I mean, we ordered it, but, like, fucking whatever.
[52:21.24]I don't want to leave.
[52:24.74]I thought we could just hang out in, like, fucking pills.
[52:26.34]So we're just going through all these puzzles so we can have a little party?
[52:30.62]Hold this for a second.
[52:35.25]And I have the detonator shield, don't forget about that.
[52:38.10]I would love to hang out with Mousetrap.
[52:41.00]Fine.
[52:41.60]And beer.
[52:42.50]I figured you weren't even close, so then I'll give you a chance to maybe do something else, but apparently not.
[52:47.66]You don't want to hang out with any of us.
[52:50.21]But I mean, if any of you want to add me on Discord, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, all those things.
[52:58.63]Yeah, just put them back on.
[53:00.06]They don't give a shit anymore.
[53:01.28]Never on.
[53:02.48]Okay, by the way, I'm going to press it.
[53:05.12]See?
[53:05.54]He's the only one that's scared.
[53:06.58]That's how I know.
[53:07.78]Yeah, calm down.
[53:08.96]Turn around.
[53:10.53]Turn around?
[53:11.57]Oh my god.
[53:12.47]Here we go again.
[53:13.25]This is actually... Oh, my ass can't fit through the door.
[53:16.75]No, I mean, it's a gun.
[53:17.71]Whatever.
[53:18.03]No, yeah, come on.
[53:19.03]Go ahead.
[53:19.57]Go ahead.
[53:19.91]We get it.
[53:20.90]I thought you guys wanted to hang out.
[53:21.90]I was just going to drop it.
[53:23.30]Like, I want to hang out.
[53:24.54]It's just... Just don't look.
[53:26.36]Whatever.
[53:26.64]It's fucking stupid.
[53:27.44]I thought we were going to have fun.
[53:30.75]I wasn't even doing anything anymore.
[53:31.93]It's like, I can barely play Nostradamus and make a funny thing.
[53:37.85]Here we go.
[53:39.29]I told you he was going to say it.
[53:42.49]He wants to do it again.
[53:43.57]This is the whole thing.
[53:45.80]Please turn around.
[53:46.94]Alright.
[53:48.08]You're allowed to.
[53:49.60]Like this shoe.
[53:51.74]I don't know how that would be relevant, but I mean, I guess we can.
[53:54.00]Guys, guys, the door.
[53:55.82]The door is moving.
[53:57.23]It's the way out.
[53:58.19]It's the way out.
[53:59.05]Come on, guys.
[53:59.53]Let's go.
[53:59.79]Oh, no.
[54:00.79]Oh, God.
[54:01.25]It's not the way out.
[54:02.99]Oh, my God.
[54:06.46]It doesn't make any sense.
[54:07.70]Did they make it through?
[54:08.58]They did, of course they did.
[54:10.16]Hello!
[54:12.60]How are you?
[54:15.28]Welcome!
[54:17.38]Those of you that remain, welcome to the final test.
[54:22.95]Still can't believe you didn't want to hang out with us, but that's fine.
[54:26.95]Yeah, take the hint.
[54:28.05]Yeah.
[54:29.66]So this final room is my most diabolical yet.
[54:34.20]I know you can all see me and I know you can all hear me.
[54:37.13]Please pay attention.
[54:38.15]This is incredibly important.
[54:40.65]The final test involves many things.
[54:43.73]It involves knowledge.
[54:45.11]It involves dates.
[54:46.41]It involves times.
[54:47.87]It involves areas around the world.
[54:51.55]Look around you.
[54:52.71]What do you see?
[54:54.63]None of those.
[54:56.65]Toys.
[54:57.43]What are you, out of your fucking mind?
[54:59.75]You don't see toys, you don't see things that were made.
[55:01.77]A little bit at this point.
[55:03.35]Name some things on the shelf for me, please.
[55:06.29]Hmm.
[55:06.49]Toys?
[55:07.65]Yes.
[55:07.99]It's a water bottle.
[55:08.69]Is that you?
[55:09.53]My two homes.
[55:09.93]A water bottle?
[55:11.01]Yeah, did you get thirsty on the way out or?
[55:12.87]We all get thirsty.
[55:14.19]My two homes.
[55:16.16]This final test is incredibly intricate and it requires a lot of explanation, so shut up.
[55:21.26]You gonna come in here and try to play with us too, like the last room or?
[55:24.24]Yeah.
[55:27.13]I'm busy or something.
[55:28.45]Oh, sure.
[55:29.13]I bet.
[55:30.11]In this room, there are toys and there are things from many different time periods.
[55:36.11]You're gonna have to know all kinds of things.
[55:37.95]Do you even know when cardboard was invented?
[55:41.31]Probably not.
[55:42.17]Why would anyone need to know that?
[55:43.53]I don't know.
[55:44.37]Every single thing in this room has to be played with in order of its date and its time it was invented.
[55:51.39]I'm working on something.
[55:54.58]Just give me a minute.
[55:59.39]You're all incredibly fucking distracting, can I say that?
[56:01.76]I've been doing this for a long time.
[56:03.08]I've been doing this for over 30 years.
[56:05.14]This group, by far, is the most unbelievable.
[56:07.60]You fucked up the whole thing.
[56:09.14]Anytime, man.
[56:10.56]Do you want me to explain it again?
[56:12.22]Do you need that, because you're children?
[56:13.94]It sounds like you want to.
[56:14.78]Go ahead.
[56:15.52]Okay, fine.
[56:16.32]Step one.
[56:16.80]Oh!
[56:17.30]Oh, my God.
[56:20.76]Oh, my God.
[56:30.43]Can't solve that puzzle, I guess.
[56:31.40]Hope he's OK.
[56:32.65]I don't know about that.
